1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
He's not happy with me, you know.

2
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:07,760
Yeah, I'm the life on, what life on that could be?

3
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:12,560
All right, I need to get a chance screen. I need to get a chance screen.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:23,280
Why is my iPhone, whoa, my iPhone bugging the fuck? Oh, relax. What? I'm bugging out.

5
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:27,360
Am I getting a challenge screen? Get a challenge screen. No.

6
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:33,520
No, hold on, hold on, hold on. Scuffs already started, boys. Scuffs already started.

7
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:38,640
Look, he's a, he's the same, he's the same. One man, one mop. I was there, doing some,

8
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:46,640
some business things. God, the frickin scuff is a thing. What the hell's going on?

9
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:56,160
The tracker is hating me right now. Can you hear me? Have you all seen this? Have you all heard

10
00:00:56,160 --> 00:01:03,200
about this? Okay, I think I'm gonna have to move the iPhone about because what the actual heck.

11
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:08,800
Can you guys hear the background music? I'm new. Okay, you can now. You can hear a bit of Assassin's

12
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:18,320
Creed. Good morning. My iPhone is bugging out right as a, I'm pretty sure this can do horizontal,

13
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:24,480
so not sure why I'm going to absolutely not hold on. I'm just calibrating, testing, left.

14
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:32,880
No, what the heck? Can you not see my face? Sorry. Blame the technology. What's that? I

15
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:39,200
should have used my loading screen. Sorry, can't relate. Couldn't care less. And something, something.

16
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:47,040
Oh my God. Is it because it's dark in this room? I can't believe it. I can't believe being a goblin

17
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:53,600
in the dark is a terrible idea for freaking tracking reasons. Hold on, hold on, I need to

18
00:01:53,600 --> 00:02:03,120
come literally on my hands and knees to plug in this light under my PC. This is nonsense. Honestly,

19
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:11,120
why can't you see me iPhone? I'm out of the port? There are no keys. Oh my God.

20
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:14,800
All right, anyway, I've got some good news.

21
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:23,680
Well, the good news is I've got my first ASMR club coming out. Right, I've got to lay on.

22
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:27,200
Right, I've got to lay on. Here we go. Here we go. Here we go. Here we go. Right, back and back

23
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:34,720
Yeah, that's snuffing those. Why? Can, can be chip studio not handle?

24
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:46,720
Why is that going? Right, I don't think the chip studio works at all horizontal. Fuck you.

25
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:54,960
You stupid little twat. First of all, you little prick. Can it hunt? Can it know it can't go horizontal?

26
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:59,520
I'm confused, but I'm ready. You know what? Fuck it. We're just jumping in. I'll,

27
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:05,280
I'll deal with the tracking issues once. Hold on, hold on.

28
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:12,320
Fuck it. There we go. I'm actually normal. I don't know why the track and bugging.

29
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:17,680
I'm covering up too much on the screen now.

30
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:23,600
Who's ready for someone's house and screen now? I do believe ASECLE is still streaming,

31
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:34,560
so please do support ASECLE. She's still streaming for a white Christmas.

32
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:42,400
Let me just check before we jump into that. I need to make sure I've got suit titles on,

33
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:49,280
spoken language, English subtitles on. Oh my God, I'm such a real gamer. Are you ready?

34
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:54,720
ASEA is just ending. Oh, does she be next? I think she'd be moving on.

35
00:03:57,520 --> 00:04:06,240
Her God's EPS soldier. Yeah. Right, okay. Oh, actually, this is some, oh wait, no.

36
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:17,920
I did all my latest, like, tipper and all that if you did a donor link to me.

37
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,160
Oh, no. Oh, you know what? Fuck it. We're playing Assassin's Creed, man. Fuck the money. I want to

38
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:28,000
play Assassin's Creed. I wanted to say something. I don't know if you guys would like this, but

39
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,880
whenever we play a video game, obviously there's names in the video game, and it's rude for a

40
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:38,240
feature, but to like name people and chat. So I want it to be like special congratulations

41
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:43,200
if your name's Desmond, if your name is Sean, if your name's Rebecca, if your name's Lucy,

42
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:48,960
if your name's Ezio, like, in the video game. I don't know, like, maybe only the guy names

43
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:55,360
make sense, but I thought that would be a bit different. Um, yeah, special show if your name's

44
00:04:55,360 --> 00:05:02,640
Desmond. Uh, wait, that's right, you get a name by me. Eh, there we go. Eh, Desmond, that's right,

45
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:07,760
your name is Desmond. Okay. I don't think anyone ever expects to wake up one morning and find

46
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:14,160
themselves caught in the middle of a war between two secret organizations. I know I did, but here

47
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:19,600
I am on one side of the world. Can you guys hear the game? Better known these days as exturgo

48
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:27,280
industries. We're in the business of control, politics, economics, technology. I school hope

49
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:31,920
you enjoyed your, uh, Tomb Raider, more like Whim Raider after I'm done with you.

50
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:43,680
That's terrible. It's terrible. Friends will remember we don't have HR at, uh, you,

51
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:51,440
did you enjoy Whim Raider? Your little EP Polar Bear? I caught the start of you swing.

victory

82
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:15,160
this is my favorite bet cuz they always glitches out the fabric always glitches

83
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:17,560
out on his knee in the scene it doesn't matter how many times you play through

84
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:21,000
this game like it is instance of new glitches gonna occur during the cut scenes

85
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:25,080
but it always glitches out on the knee at that cut scene to the matter how many

86
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:31,440
times you play it Mario what are you doing here better to be left in the hands

87
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:38,120
of the earth than in the hands of man I can't believe the Pope fucking vanished

88
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:48,960
where's that bloody popcorn sorry I'm drinking and then it makes me do hypnosis

89
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:51,960
I'll just get so excited okay

90
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:59,960
I'll be swallowed alive as a giant test for it's already occurring

91
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:08,800
are we ready are we ready are we ready for the best freaking voice line for

92
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:18,280
Mario it's such a good freaking quote

93
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:27,240
it's an entire area I was worried quick we have to get out of here okay so you

94
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:31,400
can actually jump up if you do not engage an eagle vision so we're already in

95
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:35,280
tutorial mode if you do not engage an eagle eagle vision the game will not let

96
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:41,160
you climb up at all and but until you engage it so we're playing it's your

97
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:46,440
auditorita friends it which means he was spawned in frenzy we are already an

98
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:51,880
established assassin okay we've just defeated the big bad evil and assassin

99
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:55,120
screen too I'll shut up

100
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:12,600
oh my god right okay and so yeah we're Italian so Baba the boopie all those

101
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:17,640
jokes this up next part section so we're still in tutorial mode obviously the game

102
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:21,040
but the reason why I want to mention that we're in tutorial mode is because the

103
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:26,160
game perfectly is structured

104
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:40,000
oh that's another good like you can damn what you do not understand now right so

105
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:44,480
we can push people out the way it my way it my way it my way rosary beats up your

106
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:49,120
arse leave me alone away you go Mario will actually get caught on those people

107
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:58,320
which is quite funny that's your uncle Mario my arm is attacked now I want

108
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:04,720
you to remember that pineapple for no reason at all remember the pineapple all

109
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:11,120
hail the pineapple all hail the pineapple okay this next section is how you get

110
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:14,720
one of the easiest achievements in the game and it is perfectly sequence for

111
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:20,480
you to do so so look alive this is how you get the you haven't you're not to get

112
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:23,520
hit you're not to get hit oh shit he knocked them over right hold on you

113
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:29,000
wait for them to attack and then if you perfectly execute all these men then you

114
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:34,280
get your first achievement which I believe is frenzy but if you do it

115
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:40,400
perfectly Mario shouldn't unfortunately the camera angles are a bit no I lost

116
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:46,400
the street because of the freaking camera angle anyway your first achievement is to

117
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:49,760
kill 10 people in a row you could easily do it at that section of the game but

118
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:53,920
don't worry if you miss it there are many opportunities to do so the camera

119
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:59,440
angle will make mess you up I was gonna say make you up

120
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:03,440
and the camera angles a bit funny especially when you're in between

121
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:08,240
buildings like it's telling me to follow Mario you must also trail behind

122
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:12,640
Mario a couple of meters if you are right behind him you will knock him off

123
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:17,040
his coded path the AI will fix itself and he will go back on the path but you

124
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:20,960
must give him space or you will knock him off the rooftops and then you have to

125
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:25,200
wait even longer for this section to occur but it's fine it's not bad section

126
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:30,720
this is to learn mostly rooftop moving about how to get your agility sorted

127
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:34,960
you can't get used to holding down I recommend oh see that's another thing

128
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:38,400
sometimes it say we will do something when you tell him to jump in a certain

129
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:42,320
direction it's fine this game has aged beautifully

130
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:54,560
and I believe this game came out 2012 Skyrim was 2011 again you can knock Mario

131
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:58,320
off this if you're too quick you must be careful

132
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:06,160
it was 2010 oh my god I was a baby I remember asking my dad for this game

133
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:12,000
and um fun fact my dad bought me the special edition sasa's crude brotherhood

134
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:17,280
and it came in a special box and if you opened it up I had the sasa's

135
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:22,320
a logo on it and you opened up the box and the game like pops up and presents

136
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:26,480
itself man it was freaking good here's another section if you if I

137
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:30,080
continue up he does not move are you ready for this I'm gonna

138
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:35,920
oh no like you can't progress like you have to go to the side he is in a wall

139
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:39,120
right now in the tutorial phase

140
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:45,760

i'll read it after the sections

272
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:44,640
that is the future i can't believe it there'd be it too can i tell you a sad story i actually

273
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:52,000
really cried like i cried squiddin me right now eh right i'll read the the random italian

274
00:27:52,000 --> 00:28:00,000
this person thinks i could think i can say ciao mio caro eraro verdre uno così belle

275
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:12,800
e cosi te lantoso for se puiowni i se gnarami la tua bellissima lingua thank you for listening

276
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:22,160
to my italian well i gotta give to compliment again on your heart love the accent by the way

277
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:29,040
how many times did you play the game to know it so well um the answer is uh i actually couldn't

278
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:35,280
even count how many times i've played this game i love you know anything killing us is that breath

279
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:40,320
take a drink of war

280
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:48,800
did you saw my mother in italian okay one of my biggest pet peeves about this game

281
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:55,040
the freaking cannons so you see how the hit markers there it looks like you're gonna hit it

282
00:28:55,040 --> 00:29:00,960
and the cannons are like way loud in this game they're like far too loud they're insanely loud

283
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:13,200
foul-ass breath the guy sounds like a skyrim god most video games reuse uh voice actors so you

284
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:18,880
will recognize people over and over again it's very common if you work in a video game that you

285
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:25,760
will be used for mbc's for example um are just miscellaneous characters all the time very common

286
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:31,600
skyrim is probably the biggest example of like the same seven voice actors being used over and over

287
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:38,480
again um other than sissuru and skyrim shout out to sissuru and skyrim can't remember the actual

288
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:46,720
guy's name but goodness greatly he said hi my dear it's rare to see one so beautiful and so talented

289
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:52,560
maybe you can teach me a beautiful laugh wait you can't even speak english and you like my accent

290
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:59,680
bro you're gonna be in for a shot come on my favorite oblivion line oh let me retake that

291
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:03,520
let me redo that and they left it in the game okay we have now just finished all our three

292
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:08,560
side missions we have just handled the cannons hmm suspicious i wonder why we have also been

293
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:15,120
able to ride a horse that's because in later parts of the game horse riding is very uh necessary

294
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:21,520
to explore certain locations um it's just not possible on foot it is partly you can do it but

295
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:27,120
it just takes up so much time um and we also helped the lady which established that itseo

296
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:33,200
adetori is a bit of a bit of a ladies man and he's out for ladies holes i mean we're all out

297
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:39,120
for the ladies hole at the end of the day aren't we lads hey hope this is outrageous

298
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:43,200
by zura by zura by zura

299
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:50,960
there are two major uh hubs of english voice actors the pill from the pleasure of your presence

300
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:59,440
so this is katarina sports uh she is a real person uh did occur your mercenary a very badass

301
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:04,240
personality is likely that i can give you what you see based on a real person but we will talk later

302
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:11,040
we're like katarina do fanny and because we're getting her last hair once so far

303
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:18,080
that's her mummy mummy that's marquia velly recurring character

304
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:28,080
i wish i could show you the magic she performed very good line

305
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:38,080
there the moving painting of the goddess minerva spoke

306
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:42,400
told of a terrible tragedy to befall mankind in the future

307
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:49,520
but gave hope of lost temples that will provide aid to humanity and then she called out to a

308
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:58,000
phantom desmond as if he were there who's dead beside her after her warning she vanished

309
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:05,840
amazing i cannot imagine such wonders the vault did not house the terrible weapon fear

310
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:13,920
this is good news what about this goddess this minerva did she appear human yes but her words

311
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:21,120
proved otherwise all of her kind died many years ago i wish i could show you the magic she performed

312
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:30,240
oh that was a good delivery good delivery

313
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:44,240
the script pulled off another one i got you pulled up another one

314
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:51,760
i'm surprised she remains so composed just watching the mirror on her the spaniards lives

315
00:32:55,920 --> 00:33:03,280
some of the voicelines are a bit goofy you should have killed you we're sure to suffer for it i'm not

316
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:13,200
here to debate the past together we should discuss the future no i am leaving me

317
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:16,720
i do not know why you spared him but i trust your judgment

318
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:18,640

321
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:41,600

322
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:52,000
session right now everyone get it out not for this bit the bit that follows after hold on

00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:31,520
put on that accent welcome home reflin mom is misty

329
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:49,120
do you think a con would let us have a meet a booth that would be hilarious

330
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:56,000
oh i forgot about that part of the scene oh oh like what happens in the asmr booth stays in the

331
00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:04,720
asmr booth everyone's okay everyone's uh fun fact i played this game in front of my mum and she was

332
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:10,320
mortified at this scene because i was very very young uh and i remember playing it at midnight

333
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:15,280
and i had the dining room chair in front of the tv my mom let me play it on the big tv

334
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:24,800
uh and she was like what are you playing i'm like it's a sapis grade mom please i didn't make the game

335
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:32,800
one should always have the freedom to choose oh so salty so salty

336
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:38,960
so what's that probably just training exercises

337
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:45,280
yeah damn training exercises out of control

338
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:51,280
i have to find mario and rally putting the ass in the size

339
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:59,600
actually that's another side note i can't remember why my dad needed to spell

340
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:02,880
oh i was telling my dad about like some of my favorite games of all time like a couple of years

341
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:07,040
back now he was like how do you spell assassin i was like ass ass in and we both looked at each

342
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:14,480
other like that shrek meme like like burst out laughing such children honestly

343
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:24,880
i'm not i'm not gonna lie if i felt like that my ankles would be gone they would be dust

344
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:33,200
okay this is the worst part of the game that's about to come up because you can

345
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:35,280
do everything right and the game will still fail you

346
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:41,200
so mario has the apple of eden piece of eden

347
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:43,520
away

348
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:55,760
the one italian like oh my god she really likes assassins my goodness

349
00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:03,600
to say helping uh oh no we lost our monies it's not about the money money money

350
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:07,040
forget about the money money money

351
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:13,200
you do not actually have to do anything the horse will automatically run for you in this sequence

352
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:24,400
so the entire town is now being absolutely destroyed and raided and i'm currently

353
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:26,320
singing that one scottish song

354
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:36,720
all the horses get back up in this video game i just for anyone who doesn't like when the horses

355
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:42,400
go down and with you with that the horses always stand back up in video in this video game no horse

356
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:48,560
ever stays down even if it's been attacked if it's been hurt lalala okay this is the part i hate

357
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:54,800
you can destroy all the cannons and all the freaking towns people won't escape and you can

358
00:37:54,800 --> 00:38:00,640
fail this section i have done it consecutively all you have to do is destroy the cannons ignore

359
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:05,520
everything else but the freaking it's really hard to tell yeah see i should have hit that third one

360
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:14,640
but it's really hard to tell like with the edges of like the radius your area of effect if you will

361
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:16,400
and my goodness gravy it's frustrating

362
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:22,560
no horses were harmed in the production of this video game no they're not so

363
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:29,600
please don't worry all horses get back up the aoe area of effect it's it's so freaking hard to

364
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:36,240
tell because you could perfectly angle it and you're like i should have three but yeah and especially

365
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:43,520
the ones on the hill this oh beautiful beautiful do that again hen do it again do it again do it

366
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:50,720
again give us three oh baby right so unfortunately you can't really do much more after you've killed

367
00:38:50,720 --> 00:39:01,120
this one boom baby okay next section we've got to do this bit correct because this is where you can

368
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:08,640
fail the problem with the hill is you have to like judge behind the cannons oh triple baby

369
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:12,480
let's go three for three obviously we can't do it for this one because it's not third but

370
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:14,000
we've got three for three so far

371
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:20,960
okay wait what that one survived hello

372
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:33,600
excuse me excuse me do my eyes uh so this is the problem you can't really hit those ones

373
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:37,680
now you might be saying you should hit that big brown thing i've forgotten what their legal name

374
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:45,200
is uh but the big brown thing doesn't count uh we can kill it we've done what we can so either

375
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:51,040
we'll fail or we'll win depending on what the game feels like see there's 20 villagers 10 5

376
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:56,320
we did it we didn't get a balista a siege tower i

377
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:05,040
soldiers are climbing the walls okay this is one bit i don't like about this game are you ready for

378
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:12,240
they change your weapons so they've given me a sword i've said uh let me keep my blade out because

379
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:17,600
i prefer fighting with a blade the only enemies that you're not to go against with the blade

380
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:25,040
jump down nco jeez yeah my ankles would be disintegrated if i did that um it's much easier

381
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:31,760
to fight with the blades oh my god he just curbstomped that borja guy did you see that nco

382
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:41,280
that's a war crime you can't curb stomp people that's not how it works jeez it's the old okay hold on

383
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:46,080
these enemies oh my god i just got twatted oh i'm getting twat twice sorry i'm too busy

384
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:52,320
try and be chatting and kill at the same time um no i'm missing oh no everyone gonna know i'm a

385
00:40:52,320 --> 00:41:00,080
terrible gamer um the only enemies that are not effective so like these guys for fuck's sake

386
00:41:00,080 --> 00:41:04,160
they freaking attack before they're supposed to you can break their stance just by spamming

387
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:08,720
it's not a problem again you for these guys that are double armored up literally take your gun out

388
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:14,000
boom up it didn't register esio he's getting a bit close mate you're gonna need to aim

389
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:18,240
that was getting a bit close for comfort

390
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:26,480
point blank esio that probably wasn't even five meters no been do we need to put glicks on him

391
00:41:27,360 --> 00:41:33,360
oh this is a sad bit

392
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:41,360
no

393
00:41:57,120 --> 00:42:01,360
this is an invitation my family to yours

394
00:42:02,320 --> 00:42:04,240
to yours

395
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:27,040
there was a sentence that he said though that your friend this gun that your friend fashioned for

396
00:42:27,360 --> 00:42:34,160
keep that in mind i can walk faster means to stop in italian

397
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:45,040
so we are now basically running on fumes adrenaline wise we've literally just been

398
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:52,960
absolutely destroyed we have three bullet wounds i think shoulder uh abdomen oh okay

399
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:56,320
just to show we've got two bullet wounds i could have sworn it used to be three but

400
00:42:56,320 --> 00:43:02,240
i won't probably just wish me wish me remember being uh but yeah we've literally our liver is

401
00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:10,240
currently bleeding out our kidney most like ow what happened there did you see me get turned

402
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:19,440
into that rubbish pile i was like liquid did you see that ouch i don't want to be jelly please don't

403
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:24,720
turn me into jelly hey leaf claudia lonia bam

404
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:32,320
so you'll get assigned one soldier to kill in the sequence but they all do they all are aggressive

405
00:43:32,320 --> 00:43:39,280
towards you you can clean them up if you really desire but if the arrow is red that means the

406
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:45,840
ai has assigned to attack you if the arrow is yellow they'll attack oh also the guards have

407
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:50,880
assassin abilities like how are you sitting on the wall the coding in this game is a bit funny

408
00:43:52,160 --> 00:43:56,480
if you upset NPCs they turn into assassins and start climbing walls and stuff

409
00:43:57,440 --> 00:44:02,400
you could always break a guard's stance with a kick if you are struggling to fight them

410
00:44:03,120 --> 00:44:10,640
but we do get access to long range weaponry very shortly um but yeah uh you can ignore all these

411
00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:16,400
and just go straight in here no you can you have to wait until they're assigned to you okay okay

412
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:24,640
okay the game does it quite often where it won't let you in if uh someone is target locked onto you

413
00:44:26,320 --> 00:44:30,560
hey come on claudia we ain't got all day jesus we're under a siege take your time hen

414
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:38,080
it's you i'm in here i will hold the back stop wait for us we thought you had to kill sir etio

415
00:44:38,080 --> 00:44:43,120
not yet where does this passage lead to the north outside the walls are you surprised it exists

416
00:44:43,120 --> 00:44:49,040
i might have to open my door um i must go help the troops my freaking room is getting so hot

417

00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:13,840
sit in your chairs but i sit on my feet

421
00:45:17,680 --> 00:45:22,560
we will play assassin's creed 2 because that is a very beautiful section in assassin's creed 2

422
00:45:23,120 --> 00:45:27,440
we're essentially playing assassin's creed 2.5 it's fame brotherhood's good game

423
00:45:29,040 --> 00:45:33,840
right lure lure i'm gonna take a war sip war sipping tin take a sip with me if you don't got war

424
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:41,600
you must leave this place take mother to parence get me a horse you are not coming with us

425
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:52,400
where are you riding to roma go my son destroy them but remember for whom we assassinate

426
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:56,400

i'm not flexible enough to sit on your feet i'll make you flexible once i've done me

428

429
00:46:11,920 --> 00:46:13,200
we're actually speed running

430
00:46:14,640 --> 00:46:18,320
just love this game a little everything about it the patience fantastic we've

431
00:46:18,320 --> 00:46:23,920
completed sequence dna one battle wounds achievement unlocked

432
00:46:36,560 --> 00:46:41,120
i will tell you at the end a very sad fact about that blonde girl you see on the screen right now

433
00:46:42,720 --> 00:46:46,880
but only at the end right so that says in present day

434
00:46:49,280 --> 00:46:57,760
congrats if your name's desmond congrats congrats if your name's shawn shawn's one with glasses

435
00:46:57,760 --> 00:47:03,840
congrats i'm convinced we need to get our hands on etio's apple of edin minerva altered it somehow

436
00:47:03,840 --> 00:47:08,880
when she are they tame traveling where's the autotorizo i will tell you in a second it's our

437
00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:14,000
last safe but we were present day it turns out the templars are watching the border etio hid the

438
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:21,200
the poe sometime in 1507 but when i try to access that dna sequence he seems to be remembering

439
00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:29,520
something else like a memory inside a memory yes exactly maybe exactly maybe i believe you

440
00:47:29,520 --> 00:47:34,320
experienced something similar if i could have stagger didn't you subject 15 exhibited memory

441
00:47:34,320 --> 00:47:40,240
within memory like patterns but she was pregnant the memories of prego's father and not in this

442
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:51,840
oh my god we've just been fat shamed in 2024 you guys remember when bao got that model

443
00:47:52,640 --> 00:47:58,480
and she was like inflated and someone was like this is fat shaming it was like no bro that's real

444
00:47:58,480 --> 00:48:00,320
34 open your eyes

445
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:15,760
legend coming out in inflation model and someone's like you're fat shaming it no more the bugger

446
00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:32,880
they're gonna find us no they aren't come with me

447
00:48:48,160 --> 00:48:51,920
there's a lot of cutscene stuff up ahead but i'll try and for those who don't know the game

448
00:48:51,920 --> 00:48:56,880
i will very quickly summarize from the inside we're not getting in this way what's her next

449
00:48:56,880 --> 00:49:01,760
move the road just moves back into the highway this is not a good place for us to be right now

450
00:49:01,760 --> 00:49:06,000
do we have any tarps we need to cover up the van i really hate to stress this yeah but we are

451
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:12,720
running out of time that's Sean we'll help us that's Rebecca that's Lucy any ideas i don't know

452
00:49:13,360 --> 00:49:17,200
maybe there's another way into the sanctuary hey i think i've got something

453
00:49:17,440 --> 00:49:26,720
okay so we're modern day Desmond if you don't know the game we basically have a special bloodline

454
00:49:27,920 --> 00:49:34,400
that commutes to the gods that created us and and we use Desmond's DNA sequence in order to go

455
00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:41,200
back in the past very fictional based i absolutely love the concept when i was a child and i wanted

456
00:49:41,200 --> 00:49:49,200
it to be so real i was like take me back to the battle of anaconda take me to big willy walrus

457
00:49:50,480 --> 00:49:51,920
i want to see the construction

458
00:50:02,960 --> 00:50:06,240
so we are like the trunk i'm sorry i don't know what the trunks are

459
00:50:06,240 --> 00:50:12,640
are memories are stored in DNA yes that's the quickest way oh my god me and Lucy

460
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:28,640
oh yeah you don't have fun you'll have fun with me the night Lucy

461
00:50:29,200 --> 00:50:33,040
okay

462
00:50:36,720 --> 00:50:42,400
okay there we go oh that was a loading screen by the way it looked like it wasn't they were trying

463
00:50:42,400 --> 00:50:50,080
to hide it what was that i don't see anything so Desmond also sees the past because his it's

464
00:50:50,080 --> 00:50:55,440
basically leaking into his present so Lucy can't see any of this we can see this

465
00:50:59,200 --> 00:51:06,480
they escaped through here what that's you and the villagers after the attack i can see them now

466
00:51:07,840 --> 00:51:13,680
i know it's difficult but try to compartmentalize focus on the present what if i can't stop the

467
00:51:13,680 --> 00:51:20,240
visions how long before i start painting symbols on the walls don't joke about that subject 16 had

468
00:51:20,240 --> 00:51:25,520
the bleeding effect that he's talking about and ended up in himself but we learn more about him in

469
00:51:25,520 --> 00:51:26,480
Assassin's Creed 3

470
00:51:32,240 --> 00:51:40,800
well the animus he does turn man please do not refer to the animus that lets us go back into the past

471
00:51:40,800 --> 00:51:41,680
is the animus

472
00:51:41,840 --> 00:51:49,120

473
00:51:52,640 --> 00:51:52,960
oh it's

474
00:51:54,160 --> 00:51:59,680
i'll find a way around oh it's revelations you're right sorry my apologies i apologize

475
00:52:01,760 --> 00:52:08,400
i would say this is a revelation do you guys remember dan bull's cover of Assassin's Creed

476
00:52:08,400 --> 00:52:15,680
brotherhood revelations where i meant if you see any remind me not to make you a look out

477
00:52:15,680 --> 00:52:22,400
so we are now backtracking her weight oh sorry more ghosts this is the problem there's so much

478
00:52:22,400 --> 00:52:27,760
dialogue in this game at the start and we are now backtracking trying to get back inside the villa

479
00:52:27,760 --> 00:52:33,600

483
00:52:55,840 --> 00:52:58,800

485
00:53:12,080 --> 00:53:20,720
um i just wear a bra and a hoodie that's it so my bare arms is on my game and chair right now

491
00:53:55,120 --> 00:54:00,320
can literally just do that there you can't die in this cut scene in this section of the game

492
00:54:01,440 --> 00:54:05,280
it's not a cut scene it's a section again you can just drop down it doesn't really matter

493
00:54:05,280 --> 00:54:11,840
when did this become i wish i was rich then what would be left for you

494
00:54:12,800 --> 00:54:15,760
nothing nice try ready

495
00:54:19,360 --> 00:54:23,600
god well lucy's such a skinny legend honestly found a switch

496
00:54:26,320 --> 00:54:29,840
oh no no don't do that that's the woody here we go

497
00:54:29,840 --> 00:54:37,520
oh something's open yeah my leg hey yo

498
00:54:40,560 --> 00:54:50,480
absolute brain so he shouldn't have said this line yet because oh i've never had that happen

499
00:54:50,480 --> 00:54:55,920
before i got pushed out of the way by the shadow oh my god i've never had that happen before the

500
00:54:55,920 --> 00:55:02,080
shadows are freaking i wonder if you can attack the shadow i've never been pushed out the way by

501
00:55:02,080 --> 00:55:07,920
the shadow before see this is the thing about playing the same game over and over something

502
00:55:07,920 --> 00:55:13,280
you'll happen every time and it's just fantastic anyway we're about to swim in medieval toxic waste

503
00:55:16,240 --> 00:55:18,000
the game's being coded as you play

504
00:55:18,160 --> 00:55:21,440
easy for you you aren't swimming in medieval toxic waste

505
00:55:22,800 --> 00:55:24,240
it was lucy's idea

506
00:55:28,800 --> 00:55:34,480
whoa whoa uh see when the camera angles start to shift it actually makes things like really hard

507
00:55:34,480 --> 00:55:43,040
to judge it's good for the skin remember that one post where that guy was like i'll for 500

508
00:55:43,120 --> 00:55:48,000
dollars let me go in your septic tank and he just hangs out in there and does the thing and it was

509
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:52,800
like oh you're i mean yeah that was quite the pose

510
00:55:57,040 --> 00:56:02,400
you're going so fast the game can't keep up that was minging on his phone

511
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:11,920
i have to get wet because you're here charming oh my god it's you know this man

512
00:56:11,920 --> 00:56:16,800
did you just ask a woman why she's not wet thanks that's sexual harassment honestly

513
00:56:16,800 --> 00:56:22,320
water check oh i just fell water oh well it's fine

514
00:56:23,920 --> 00:56:28,240
sorry it like cold water just went on my leg and i'm like ah you know what that's fine

515
00:56:28,240 --> 00:56:29,600
that's actually not that big a deal

516
00:56:32,720 --> 00:56:35,840
jesus it's you know that's brutal making someone fall to their death

517
00:56:38,080 --> 00:56:40,560
now i'm wet i'm a cut of fish i was wet from the start

518
00:56:45,280 --> 00:56:51,040
human resources why a septic tank it's just what the guy wanted it's like that japanese post

519
00:56:51,760 --> 00:56:58,400
oh this is another thing there is this is a true hashtag true story um

520
00:56:59,520 --> 00:57:08,800
so this wife went away on holiday for the weekend and her neighbor on friday went into her like

521
00:57:08,800 --> 00:57:15,040
toilet tank like japanese toilets are different from the way it's like done so he could look up

522
00:57:15,040 --> 00:57:22,400
and peep at her while she disintegrated basically um and because she went away on holiday uh that

523
00:57:22,400 --> 00:57:34,160
man perished uh via um freezing to death in kaka it was like bro don't get me wrong i'm no really

524
00:57:34,320 --> 00:57:41,280
any shame in anyone for what they like but to die to die i'll wait here

525
00:57:41,920 --> 00:57:48,000
it's a bit extreme it's a bit extreme like oh i did the last one oh jisun messed up on that one

526
00:57:48,000 --> 00:58:01,680
i'm not gonna lie oh jisun uh got it yeah thank you desmond did they scatter his ashes that's too

528
00:58:14,880 --> 00:58:20,160
anyway the sequence is just teaching us the relationship that it's ill has with lucy

529
00:58:20,720 --> 00:58:26,160
a desmond has with lucy jesus i have the bleeding effect myself no no before you freaking take

530
00:58:26,240 --> 00:58:32,800
that out of context the bleeding effect is when desmond thingy's uh vtuber's stomach is so it must

531
00:58:32,800 --> 00:58:40,000
mean they're they're just a ketchup packet no stop it with the ketchup packet allegations okay

yellow hello should i be worried do we need to get you a doctor

535
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:20,240
when the past memories and new ones melt in yes desmond has a very hard time differentiating

536
00:59:20,240 --> 00:59:26,240
himself from xio because he spends so much time in the animus as xio i mean you'd do it too

537
00:59:27,360 --> 00:59:31,760
you'd do it too you'd do it too all right friendly over the section

538
00:59:32,320 --> 00:59:35,120

541
00:59:48,080 --> 00:59:54,240
well i'm as if you die in the animus

542
00:59:55,680 --> 00:59:56,800
and you just perish

543
00:59:58,720 --> 01:00:00,240

um like obviously i'm happy to talk about like some behind the scenes stuff but like they were

567
01:02:32,320 --> 01:02:36,640
kind of shocked that i'm like yeah just do what you want like whatever you want go for it you can

568
01:02:36,640 --> 01:02:40,720

570
01:02:46,160 --> 01:02:54,720
um yeah just do what you want have fun i'm here to be a booty hole right look around montoregioni

571
01:02:54,720 --> 01:02:59,120
for circuiters and a little dude asked they'll re-route small amounts of electricity to the

572
01:02:59,120 --> 01:03:03,280
power line underneath the villa don't ask me how they work if i understood that i wouldn't be the

573
01:03:03,280 --> 01:03:13,200
the fella hiding the van i used to think he um he is he wheatley i think he might be wheatley

574
01:03:13,200 --> 01:03:22,880
i'm not sure from uh portal 2 so we're now currently getting an energy supply to the animus

575
01:03:22,880 --> 01:03:29,840
underneath the villa in order for upstair go the big baddies are called upstair go in this game

576
01:03:29,840 --> 01:03:35,200
or templar so those are the big baddies um so basically you just need to go around the city

577
01:03:35,200 --> 01:03:40,560
you can see that the patched everything up from the uh five centuries ago uh that the big old

578
01:03:40,560 --> 01:03:49,840
fights were occurring i really like stacey milk i saw the reaction to fondle a bosom

579
01:03:51,600 --> 01:03:58,080
admit that it was funny okay admit that it was funny or pick up 24 cards in uno right now

580
01:03:58,080 --> 01:04:04,160
and anyone sitting with 24 cards in their hand are liars okay fondle a bosom was hilarious i don't

581
01:04:04,160 --> 01:04:11,440
care i think someone was like it sounds like you're naming them from like that parody um uh that parody

582
01:04:11,440 --> 01:04:18,560
movie uh austin powers and i'm like yeah you're supposed to have fun names who want serious names

583
01:04:18,560 --> 01:04:26,320
that like no one can remember like cuttles cuttlefish okay strongy cuttles let's go uh a polar bear

584
01:04:26,320 --> 01:04:32,080
okay i see i see snow paws yes she has paws and she's cold i see snow paws let's go like it's

585
01:04:32,080 --> 01:04:37,200
really it's not that bad um so you're supposed to just look around with eagle vision to get a sense

586
01:04:37,200 --> 01:04:44,160
of moving around um and all that jazz there's like one right next to me isn't there yet it's right

587
01:04:44,160 --> 01:04:57,600
behind me uh box that was not a name carambi no carambi for like a cs go whichever perfect name

588
01:04:57,600 --> 01:05:04,240
don't care carambi yes and caram sounds like ha ha ram so you can probably make a few puns

589
01:05:04,400 --> 01:05:13,280
yes it's booted we're good to go yes it's booted name from money python's life of bright incontinent

590
01:05:13,280 --> 01:05:19,280
above african saw you's all laughing at it and someone posted that incontinent to a screenshot

591
01:05:19,280 --> 01:05:24,000
i was like oh no they've got me laughing that was like oh that was actually really funny

592
01:05:24,800 --> 01:05:29,120
right we're going in the animus we're about to go back into the past to be it's your auditory

593
01:05:29,120 --> 01:05:33,600
if we're still in the tutorial stage i will tell you when we get out of this tutorial stage

594
01:05:33,600 --> 01:05:40,320
we've still probably got another hour in a bit sanctuary sanctuary as you may have noticed in

595
01:05:40,320 --> 01:05:45,600
the van i've made some improvements to the animus and i've already seen a new vr training program

596
01:05:46,880 --> 01:05:51,680
here you can show off all those flashy moves you picked up from your ancestors let me open one

597
01:05:51,680 --> 01:05:59,360
in the mission ac show ac hall okay but it doesn't make sense maybe if we had like a fire and ace

598
01:05:59,360 --> 01:06:05,120
like vtuber design ac no we can't like call ac we already have ac oh oh shit okay so this is

599
01:06:05,120 --> 01:06:12,320
the virtual training i despise it i absolutely despise it i just cannot stand this section

600
01:06:12,320 --> 01:06:18,400
it's for people who enjoy the combat or practice in it me i hate to despise it okay you see that

601
01:06:18,400 --> 01:06:25,520
skinny guard he is a problem they can grab you yeah see the guards are trying to grab me and then

602
01:06:25,520 --> 01:06:32,080
it breaks your streak if they grab you and it's so annoying i freaking hate the wee guards honestly

603
01:06:32,640 --> 01:06:38,000
oh and i hate the lancers too i absolutely hate it i'm much better in combat yeah fuck you take it

604
01:06:38,960 --> 01:06:44,320
take it the lancers have much bigger reach and are very hard to counter so when you're on a

605
01:06:44,320 --> 01:06:49,280
killing streak it's much better to aim for those guys to defend your streak basically

606
01:06:49,280 --> 01:06:57,840
skinny ball bad guards oh honestly lancers hate the skinny guards hate because they are agile

607
01:06:57,840 --> 01:07:03,360
warriors and you have to freaking have a wee knife out in order to counter them properly

608
01:07:04,240 --> 01:07:12,720
shrimp check yep posture still shrimp thank you oh we're in the tutorial for like another two hours

609
01:07:12,720 --> 01:07:18,000
but the reason i'm going to praise the game is because it's hidden that you're in the tutorial

610
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:24,880
you progress through the story of the game via the tutorial like i know it sounds silly to praise

611
01:07:24,880 --> 01:07:31,520
that because obviously all games work like that but i'll kind of point it out if you need to take

612
01:07:31,520 --> 01:07:37,680
a break log out of the anime you can leave the machine whenever you like i'm all set to go don't

613
01:07:37,680 --> 01:07:43,920
worry one last thing as you raise your synchronization by executing is that the way

614
01:07:43,920 --> 01:07:49,520
press memories might even discover some repressed memories she be caught in bottom

615
01:07:55,920 --> 01:07:59,600
ass and feet locked on that seat oh that's actually a really good like model

616
01:08:00,400 --> 01:08:04,720
ready for like a eight hour stream ass and feet get on that suit

617
01:08:06,960 --> 01:08:12,000
anyway i never expected you to see you play something i have terrible news but these

618
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:17,680
shippers normally play a video game with eye in the database now you won't find it

619
01:08:25,200 --> 01:08:27,280
okay we're here present day

620
01:08:29,920 --> 01:08:33,760
give me one second i'm gonna get a cola okay i'll leave that on so at least i'm not yapping

621
01:08:33,760 --> 01:08:37,520
over the actual cutscenes for once in my freaking life

622
01:08:56,000 --> 01:09:01,120
oh my god we're being touched by a whammy sorry i forget my hip i need to close my eyes if i walk

623
01:09:01,120 --> 01:09:08,000

01:09:20,480 --> 01:09:28,480
oh gorgeous

626
01:09:38,240 --> 01:09:43,680
i just got chills it's such an idiot i just love this game so much

627
01:09:43,680 --> 01:09:53,760
it's just feel like so full of it like my heart feels so full i get to share this game and

628
01:09:54,880 --> 01:10:02,320
just appreciate it for what it is and this game come out in 2010 and it aged beautifully i will

629
01:10:02,320 --> 01:10:07,760
not tell i will not take anyone telling me this game didn't age well so we're currently injured

630
01:10:07,760 --> 01:10:13,760
and going to the doctor we're about to learn about health bar so we're still injured we're

631
01:10:13,760 --> 01:10:21,440
still hurt in the top left corner we have five health squares and only one left that is how

632
01:10:21,440 --> 01:10:26,000
we deal with health in the game do not take that horse i don't know why they put that horse there

633
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:29,760
unironically you don't go any faster on the horse to get to the healer

634
01:10:32,960 --> 01:10:36,880
trying to tip you it says internal server it's okay you don't have to give me money just hanging

635
01:10:36,880 --> 01:10:42,320
out it's fine i'm not sure what the problem is but hey but don't worry you don't have to give me

636
01:10:42,320 --> 01:10:47,840
money thank you for being here for a man of your age tisk tisk

637
01:10:47,840 --> 01:10:52,480
someone your age cannot recover from your wound like this with medicine here is something to

638
01:10:52,480 --> 01:10:59,360
dull the pain it would heal over time four out of five doctors would suggest leeches

639
01:11:00,880 --> 01:11:07,120
no leeches things however i can recommend several good colleagues around the sea do you

640
01:11:07,120 --> 01:11:13,840
need anything else have fun at work don't worry guys if you ever have to leave stream i am an

641
01:11:13,840 --> 01:11:20,000
endurance streamer i'm not very friendly because i'm a long time streamer um i do plan on streaming

642
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:28,240
for eight hours or finishing the story mode of this game um and tomorrow we will 100% it

643
01:11:28,240 --> 01:11:35,360
because i've never 100% at the game before but with your encouragement i think it's possible

644
01:11:35,360 --> 01:11:41,840
i think i could 100% this game when you collect all the board your tower like the flags um

645
01:11:42,800 --> 01:11:47,120
all the hidden flags that are also in the halls of narrow which i will teach you all about very

646
01:11:47,120 --> 01:11:54,800
shortly so this beautiful cutscene is how we unlock sections of the map on the HUD okay they're all

647
01:11:54,800 --> 01:12:01,120
hidden at the moment but we are going to be doing map update as you can see uh synchronized view

648
01:12:01,120 --> 01:12:09,120
points beauty beauty beauty it jokes on you i'm listening at work oh my god those are the naughty

649
01:12:09,360 --> 01:12:21,280
naughty stinky borja we don't like borja we don't take kindly to your kind around these parts borja

650
01:12:23,760 --> 01:12:31,680
100% in this game in two days possible yes sir with autism anything is possible i'm so sorry

651
01:12:31,680 --> 01:12:40,560
i'm so sorry i apologize um i am very passionate about what i'm passionate about and if i am like

652
01:12:40,560 --> 01:12:46,400
unable to do so so ie i can just straight up like play this game the way i wanted then yes

653
01:12:46,400 --> 01:12:53,760
we're also like 100% in skyrim next week achievement one i'm so sorry it must be like really weird

654
01:12:53,760 --> 01:12:59,360
just randomly coming out with it i'll uh we'll refer to the strontism how about that so we're

655
01:12:59,360 --> 01:13:04,960
currently tailing do you see the yellow hit marker or hit box above these this is tailing it means

656
01:13:04,960 --> 01:13:10,640
do not be discovered by them they can be pushed by npcs so they can turn around and look at you

657
01:13:10,640 --> 01:13:18,000
it's not um it's not the best but um it certainly works perfectly well um

658
01:13:20,320 --> 01:13:25,200
it's absolutely beautiful game so we're just entailing these guards don't look backwards

659
01:13:25,200 --> 01:13:31,040
unless an npc kindly bumps into them so we can get as close as we want we can like creep on the

660
01:13:31,040 --> 01:13:35,840
walls cc he just turned around there if i wasn't creeping on the wall even the game's like uh you

661
01:13:35,840 --> 01:13:39,760
should maintain your distance you're a bit too close but we can like creep creeping

662
01:13:56,160 --> 01:14:00,880
okay and you can also blend in but i am not controlling the movement of this crowd the

663
01:14:00,880 --> 01:14:06,560
crowd will go on a certain path so you can part ways but you cannot be discovered while concealed

664
01:14:06,560 --> 01:14:12,640
in a crowd like this guards can walk by me i can have high notoriety and guards will ignore me as

665
01:14:12,640 --> 01:14:19,840
long as i am coming 100% in the achievements in skyrim sorry i don't mean 100% in skyrim because

666
01:14:19,920 --> 01:14:25,680
that is impossible as you said because of the repeating quest factors the achievements i have

667
01:14:25,680 --> 01:14:31,600
100% in skyrim achievements multiple times and i would absolutely love to share the experience

668
01:14:31,600 --> 01:14:40,480
with you and tell you about all the secret uh little bits i know um and yeah okay i'm also

669
01:14:40,480 --> 01:14:45,520
going to mention the multiplayer in brotherhood i believe the servers are down okay oh whoa that

670
01:14:45,520 --> 01:14:51,280
just came out nowhere hold on hold on we weren't even at the we were not even at the section okay we

671
01:14:51,280 --> 01:15:00,720
didn't even go we were nco didn't kill civilians did that kill a human like a non-guard what is

672
01:15:00,720 --> 01:15:07,280
going on oh my god sorry the sequence was not supposed to start on that staircase it's supposed

673
01:15:07,440 --> 01:15:11,200
to start by this freaking did that kill him if i'm a citizen

674
01:15:17,920 --> 01:15:24,160
what just happened i think i was too distracted i apologize but don't worry we can always replay

675
01:15:24,160 --> 01:15:30,400
and come back for 100 percent i can't believe i just killed a citizen i never make that mistake

676
01:15:30,400 --> 01:15:33,520
in this game sorry

677
01:15:44,080 --> 01:15:45,520
i too have lost family to the rope

678
01:15:45,600 --> 01:15:53,200
i understand how can you my libya was innocent i have lost family to the rope treachery

679
01:15:55,360 --> 01:15:59,440
you called you cuddled off that's so hangy if i cut her rope

680
01:16:03,360 --> 01:16:09,520
what the fuck down sorry you guys didn't see that all these options just popped up on my screen

681
01:16:10,240 --> 01:16:17,440
i was like these are too many things going on right now okay so this quest do you see how

682
01:16:17,440 --> 01:16:22,640
we are assigned someone with a name that is because you're actually killing multiplayer

683
01:16:22,640 --> 01:16:29,280
characters that are in multiplayer i know it sounds silly and i know it sounds bizarre but

684
01:16:30,480 --> 01:16:36,080
when you could play uh assassin's group brotherhood multiplayer um you got to pick between the skins

685
01:16:36,080 --> 01:16:41,680
and we're literally about to kill someone who is a skin in the multiplayer mode uh 100 for this

686
01:16:41,680 --> 01:16:47,280
one is just air assassination super simple and easy uh the guards do attack you but some turn

687
01:16:47,280 --> 01:16:53,200
into cowards once you kill multiple guards which is a lovely paypal support doesn't open for several

688
01:16:53,200 --> 01:17:03,200
hours did i break paypal are you guys trying to support me too much that we broke paypal

689
01:17:03,760 --> 01:17:10,960
wait can none of the girls get donations right now uh so you can't be grabbed but as i said

690
01:17:10,960 --> 01:17:15,920
the more guards you kill some of the weaker ones like the ones with just a hat will turn into

691
01:17:15,920 --> 01:17:22,720
cowards which is an absolutely lovely human detail yeah see the ones with uh those like

692
01:17:22,720 --> 01:17:31,760
beret type hats they turn into cowards beautiful beautiful detail i think that is gorgeous to show

693
01:17:31,840 --> 01:17:38,480
human nature instead of the ai just being like constantly attack attack attack die die die

694
01:17:38,480 --> 01:17:48,480
because you will i just think these are and this is 2010 development was 20 2008 2008 maybe even

695
01:17:48,480 --> 01:17:56,240
as far back as 2007 um so you're not allowed to scale the rooftops because guards find you extremely

696
01:17:56,240 --> 01:18:02,640
sussy but guards on the floor don'ts like this guy does not care about me right now um but like

697
01:18:02,640 --> 01:18:09,360
for development that far back to like capture to even think outside the box to capture human nature

698
01:18:09,360 --> 01:18:16,560
like that definitely hats off to the development team um i know it is by ubisoft and there are some

699
01:18:16,560 --> 01:18:24,320
very there's a very unique ending to this tale and assassins crude brotherhood and i couldn't for

700
01:18:24,320 --> 01:18:31,040
the life of me uh there's a feather up on here by the way uh you can grab sightings if you cite

701
01:18:31,040 --> 01:18:36,000
something but can't grab it you can go into ego mode and then it'll automatically stick to your map

702
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:41,760
which is fantastic so if you see something but you can't grab it in the moment um but yeah

703
01:18:43,440 --> 01:18:53,440
this game has also been rated in the top 100 games of all time i believe it placed around 60th

704
01:18:53,440 --> 01:19:00,640
on recent 100 uh game ranking tech things but sas crude brotherhood always makes it and i 100

705
01:19:00,640 --> 01:19:07,120
agree for me it is first place but i'm biased but absolutely deserved it so we have met marquia

706
01:19:07,120 --> 01:19:13,680
veli this is marquia veli he was the guy um that was in the villa and that was disappointed in us

707
01:19:13,680 --> 01:19:21,360
not killing the spaniard uh and he is gonna tell us what's going on in roma because we don't know

708
01:19:21,360 --> 01:19:26,240
what's going on in roma we know the borja is everywhere as we can see them literally in front

709
01:19:26,240 --> 01:19:31,920
of us right now so we are going to get the dirty details on what's going on in roma you would be

710
01:19:31,920 --> 01:19:40,080
wise to purchase missing equipment you will not live long in roma without supplies i have my blade

711
01:19:40,960 --> 01:19:48,000
and the guards have their guns good to see of the borja fortunately i can help

712
01:19:53,360 --> 01:19:57,760
borja hate we hate the borja perhaps you will listen to reason i'm gonna burp is that okay

713
01:19:58,320 --> 01:20:04,160
i will let you know that was me popping my lips that was the actual burp sorry sorry to mislead

714
01:20:04,160 --> 01:20:10,240
you like that so you need to wait for a little second because if you go too quickly into the

715
01:20:11,120 --> 01:20:17,040
blacksmith the items won't actually be available to purchase which is your literal quest so you're

716
01:20:17,040 --> 01:20:22,800
buying an armor and a small weapon this small weapon is what you use against the skinny guards

717
01:20:22,800 --> 01:20:29,680
because it is amazing for taming on defending yourself now you can survive that's right that's

718
01:20:29,680 --> 01:20:32,880
right i debated you didn't know yeah you thought that pop was my burp

719
01:20:32,880 --> 01:20:36,080
and

720
01:20:58,080 --> 01:21:00,320
so for some reason even though you're right next to him

721
01:21:00,320 --> 01:21:03,520
he gets really quiet in certain voicelines

722
01:21:13,760 --> 01:21:15,920
i'm literally hugging him to get him to talk

723
01:21:20,960 --> 01:21:21,520
money

724
01:21:25,520 --> 01:21:27,520
jar of leeches

725
01:21:30,400 --> 01:21:37,520
so again eagle vision to lock in that flag because we can't grab it right now but that's okay

726
01:21:38,400 --> 01:21:38,720
so

727
01:21:52,640 --> 01:22:00,560
okay so we're starting to learn that the borja has overtaken roma and is completely messing up for

728
01:22:00,560 --> 01:22:08,080
the people and mark you avail is obviously not very happy but we have to do what the current

729
01:22:08,080 --> 01:22:18,880
laid-out rules are and the yummy jar of leeches the cuttlefish eat leeches i feel like they probably

730
01:22:18,880 --> 01:22:21,200
do

731
01:22:25,040 --> 01:22:26,160
i'll talk after this but

732
01:22:28,640 --> 01:22:35,120
water check should we not travel by horse roma is quite large as chaserates conquest in romania

733
01:22:35,120 --> 01:22:41,280
continue to succeed the borja growing power they have taken desirable areas of the city for

734
01:22:41,280 --> 01:22:48,400
themselves we cannot use the stables here oh they will have the borja is low now what are

735
01:22:48,400 --> 01:22:54,480
you implying it's you do not play dumb with me matthew early do you have some kind of plan

736
01:22:54,480 --> 01:23:01,840
i am improvising okay now to very quickly bring you up to speed the borja are forbidding us in

737
01:23:01,840 --> 01:23:08,880
this section to use the stables and other areas of development also this is the most

738
01:23:08,880 --> 01:23:15,600
fucking annoying thing to get a hundred percent on hold on oh get off the horse i hate when they

739
01:23:15,600 --> 01:23:23,120
go on the horse oh no i've made it so much worse okay so this captain you have to grab him and put

740
01:23:23,120 --> 01:23:30,160
him in that um uh oh my god that freaking citizen was in the way i didn't want to strike in case

741
01:23:30,160 --> 01:23:37,520
i can't see because of the camera angle by the way this game aged really well it aged really well

742
01:23:37,520 --> 01:23:48,000
i promise it aged well no right i am going to no he's on it no this couldn't have gone any worse

743
01:23:49,360 --> 01:23:55,360
please i've never had this issue in this game before right just grab him grab him and push him

744
01:23:55,360 --> 01:24:01,440
fuck him you can kill no right no right we're not a hundred percent in this right now i'm literally

745
01:24:01,520 --> 01:24:08,400
bright red an embarrassment of this gameplay where fuck you fuck you fuck you fuck you

746
01:24:11,600 --> 01:24:18,160
please get off the horses i hate when they're on the horses all right maybe i can do it hold on

747
01:24:18,160 --> 01:24:24,080
oh my god i can still 100 percent it okay you need to basically drag this guy to the scaffolding

748
01:24:24,080 --> 01:24:34,720
and push him in it yes whenever you kill a captain of a district always loot his body he has insane

749
01:24:34,720 --> 01:24:41,280
amounts of money on his person that was terrible but we resurrected it the reason and you have to kill

750
01:24:41,280 --> 01:24:46,960
the other guards first is so you are free to push that guy into the scaffolding to achieve 100 on this

751
01:24:47,520 --> 01:24:54,480
borgia tower my god i have never attracted those other four guards before i've never had them jump

752
01:24:54,480 --> 01:25:05,760
on freaking horses before that was terrible but we did it we got a hundred percent oh my god

753
01:25:05,760 --> 01:25:12,560
i'm my face is bright red i'm like oh my god oh i forgot to burn the tower oh for goodness sake

754
01:25:12,560 --> 01:25:20,000
we're okay we need to call it not the tower oh my god i'm getting so flustered oh right so we've

755
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:27,360
just reclaimed this district so you need to burn the tower to in order to symbolize to the borgia

756
01:25:27,360 --> 01:25:32,320
they're no longer welcome in this area and their rules no longer apply to this current district of

757
01:25:32,320 --> 01:25:41,680
roma okay wait i'm an idiot markia valley hasn't told me to burn the tower yet please pardon me

758
01:25:41,680 --> 01:25:49,360
for jumping that i'm skipping ahead of the game right out my way out my way out my way out my way

759
01:25:49,360 --> 01:25:53,520
the guards make peep you here but they don't actually get you okay we are now giving instructions

760
01:25:57,920 --> 01:26:03,280
you are right we need to send they see oh i might need to take my hoodie off i'm sweating and embarrassed

761
01:26:03,280 --> 01:26:07,840
man i was like oh my god you guys are gonna think i've never played this game before i'm like no

762
01:26:07,840 --> 01:26:12,160
it's my favorite game of all time the guards outside there will peep you but they'll never

763
01:26:12,160 --> 01:26:18,240
follow you inside as long as you keep moving yeah the guards will never go for you um literally

764
01:26:18,240 --> 01:26:24,400
xio is exhausted he's climbed this tower three times now he's like jesus women give me a break

765
01:26:24,400 --> 01:26:29,840
okay you can ignite to the borgia tower like so

766
01:26:38,240 --> 01:26:51,520
oh because they all get killed okay now this is another interesting part of the

767
01:26:51,520 --> 01:26:56,080
game which you can renovate districts to have an income

768
01:27:00,080 --> 01:27:07,680
the controller vibration on the literally uh is crazy okay we have just renovated the

769
01:27:07,680 --> 01:27:16,160
stables we now have access to horsey warseys yeah no so we will jump on a horse thank you

770
01:27:16,160 --> 01:27:26,480
horse vtuber we love you he does he's supposed to talk to you through this but it bugs out so

771
01:27:26,480 --> 01:27:33,200
he's not talking to us right now but basically he's like uh you can't just do what you want xio

772
01:27:33,200 --> 01:27:39,120
it's dangerous roma have been here the borgia have like settled their ways the people are scared

773
01:27:39,120 --> 01:27:44,480
basically too long didn't read thank you marquia valley for your input it always bugs out he should

774
01:27:44,480 --> 01:27:56,720
be talking to us like right now you always use the white and gray horse here i'm gonna say something

775
01:27:56,720 --> 01:28:04,480
oh here we go but can you also close them i intend to heal the sickness or treat it simple

776
01:28:05,440 --> 01:28:09,440
stop sparring with me fine let us talk openly there

777
01:28:11,440 --> 01:28:18,000
oh he mad at us i am inclined to disagree look at this is the center of borgia

778
01:28:19,600 --> 01:28:24,240
killing one man and not change this you need to take away the source about

779
01:28:25,360 --> 01:28:30,240
are you suggesting we are beating to the death yes brotherhood of the people yes yes yes yes

780
01:28:30,240 --> 01:28:35,840
oh shit sorry sorry also you should always go behind the npc because that'll happen

781
01:28:40,160 --> 01:28:41,280
the audio is bugging out

782
01:28:45,760 --> 01:28:46,880

821
01:33:44,560 --> 01:33:51,120
my heart feels full of relief it is so bootyful um obviously because of it's an older game you

822
01:33:51,120 --> 01:33:58,320
can see the distance rendering not loud just the scream was ear piercing oh okay do apologize for

823
01:33:58,320 --> 01:34:04,480
that sometimes i get a little bit excited but i'm sure you like it when a girl screams in your ear

825
01:34:15,840 --> 01:34:16,960
okay there we go we made it

826
01:34:16,960 --> 01:34:21,760
did you liberate your money from our friend

827
01:34:22,320 --> 01:34:28,400
and be a small victory they are up and time with work we'll have a few dozen more

828
01:34:28,400 --> 01:34:34,400
depends on the the the subject six you mentioned we'll be broken we'll do that at the end i don't

829
01:34:34,400 --> 01:34:39,120
want to do subject 16 right now where is my contact Vinicius he should have already intercepted the

830
01:34:39,120 --> 01:34:46,320
letter okay follow me okay we are now raiding our horses through roma uh mark your valley is

831
01:34:46,400 --> 01:34:51,760
just kind of spanked us for being like you believe in the people and esio goes yeah i believe in the

832
01:34:51,760 --> 01:34:56,000
people and then the people just stole a lot of money from us but we got it back that's fine that's

833
01:34:56,000 --> 01:35:03,200
the main thing but esio is starting the concept of the brotherhood of assassins where you take an

834
01:35:03,200 --> 01:35:10,880
ordinary citizen who is fed up with life who is being treated badly who has just had an absolutely

835
01:35:10,880 --> 01:35:18,240
awful time and you've gone hey do you want to get back at your oppressors and then they go uh cc

836
01:35:18,240 --> 01:35:23,680
because obviously they're italian they wouldn't say yes they'd say see you and then the good part of

837
01:35:23,680 --> 01:35:29,040
the the best part i would argue about this game starts up from there

838
01:35:31,360 --> 01:35:33,360
okay so we're just following horsey horsey around

839
01:35:36,320 --> 01:35:40,000
i love you excelene because i'm low IQ don't worry i'm low IQ in general but these are just

840
01:35:40,080 --> 01:35:47,520
one of the games that i'm like uh i love everything about see the means of the projection

841
01:35:51,520 --> 01:35:57,840
astronomy can relate to being a precious gosh steady on thankfully i was born in a good time

842
01:35:57,840 --> 01:36:04,320
line but uh if you didn't know the english tried to eradicate uh scottish people many a time uh

843
01:36:04,320 --> 01:36:13,200
however uh the romans built a wall called hadrian's wall because they weren't interested in going

844
01:36:13,200 --> 01:36:20,000
any further into scotland they said now you guys can keep it we're not interested in invading us

845
01:36:21,040 --> 01:36:22,960
that's true that's actually science

846
01:36:26,480 --> 01:36:33,120
leave my thieves alone you foul beast oh that was a bit steady on it esio what was that so you're

847
01:36:33,120 --> 01:36:39,280
supposed to like jump on them okay well we got countered so i'll just be up this i just kicked

848
01:36:41,040 --> 01:36:47,920
i've never had these issues oh my god performance i can't get up one in three men

849
01:36:52,000 --> 01:36:56,400
time me at the term the bass okay we'll find you at the bass okay we're about to do a major

850
01:36:56,400 --> 01:37:03,680
tutorial part coming up but don't worry it's like a good part um so we're just gonna skedaddle halfway

851
01:37:03,680 --> 01:37:09,840
through this we're currently in the coliseum uh coliseum has been wrecked for many a century now

852
01:37:09,840 --> 01:37:17,360
this is very accurate to probably what it looks like i'm going one one one one in three men but

853
01:37:17,360 --> 01:37:30,800
one in one coliseum how dare you i assure you my bony bony can my my pecker um it's so easy to get

854
01:37:31,760 --> 01:37:40,240
to get engorged oh my god i want to be an announcer any engorgers anyone getting

855
01:37:40,560 --> 01:37:49,280
engorged right now yeah yeah i bet you are okay this part if we can do it flawlessly first time

856
01:37:49,280 --> 01:37:56,080
so i don't need to be embarrassed however the game crashes at this part multiple times for me so

857
01:37:58,000 --> 01:38:03,120
first things first take out your wee knife know the big knife take out your wee knife okay

858
01:38:04,000 --> 01:38:09,040
for this part that comes up because you're supposed to not get hit god damn you can see me

859
01:38:09,040 --> 01:38:18,960
river and moon walked into that sequence there we are about to encounter a second enemy not

860
01:38:20,160 --> 01:38:32,560
the border romuli let's see if i can do this without messing up okay pause you have to reselect

861
01:38:32,560 --> 01:38:39,600
your small knife because the game always right if i don't get hit i am blessed by the gods because

862
01:38:39,600 --> 01:38:49,760
you're supposed to do the sequence without getting hit i hate when they attack that blinking means

863
01:38:49,760 --> 01:38:54,320
they're attacking and you can't if they have the red hit marker above their head you can't

864
01:38:54,320 --> 01:38:59,120
tell if they're about to okay we got we got the ten in a row serial killer achievement

865
01:38:59,200 --> 01:39:06,240
oh we did it hundred percent of that oh that bit always stresses me at my heart rate

866
01:39:08,000 --> 01:39:15,040
okay this is a tutorial sequence this is called the layers of romulus

867
01:39:15,680 --> 01:39:19,520
goya or romuli if you you want to get take his baking but romulus

868
01:39:19,760 --> 01:39:29,600
wow i swear she killed them all with one knife so this is timed okay we're on a timer

869
01:39:30,480 --> 01:39:38,320
and you will watch me pass up flags and as well as pass up treasure boxes because we will have to

870
01:39:38,320 --> 01:39:42,800
come back in a hundred percent this section because in order to get the hundred percent

871
01:39:43,680 --> 01:39:50,880
and time love is what this one is so we're just gonna speed on by we're gonna do a little speed

872
01:39:50,880 --> 01:39:56,320
gonzalez i am not going to read chat for eight minutes it takes me about seven minutes to do

873
01:39:56,320 --> 01:40:02,080
the sequence the timer is eight minutes i apologize chat i can see you rating my burp in the corner

874
01:40:02,080 --> 01:40:08,240
of my eye you must always do the levers in this order in order to maximize your time

875
01:40:08,240 --> 01:40:16,640
um it is possible that you fall in a sequence and you'll lose time um but normally i finish

876
01:40:17,200 --> 01:40:25,040
roughly 40 seconds to one minute early um unfortunately this game's a bit funnery i've

877
01:40:25,040 --> 01:40:30,160
just wasted a bit of time doing that which is a shame but hey ho it's what happens

878
01:40:31,200 --> 01:40:37,680
uh but yes obviously you can tell the music's a bit different the i don't know how compose the music

879
01:40:37,760 --> 01:40:45,200
or who is commissioned to compose the music very very good okay i can read you for like one second

880
01:40:45,200 --> 01:40:52,720
she hates us no i'm done i need to do the time sequence i finish early oh i finish early all

881
01:40:52,720 --> 01:40:59,840
right you want to tell me you can tell you how early i finish i think i've said this before but um

882
01:41:00,560 --> 01:41:09,840
my record is like one minute and like 54 seconds roughly and the only reason i know why is because

883
01:41:09,840 --> 01:41:17,040
that's how long the preview was for the video it was a free preview i'm just gonna admit it sorry but

884
01:41:17,600 --> 01:41:24,640
if you guys are like i'm so nervous to talk to her in chat i am absolutely not destined

885
01:41:25,440 --> 01:41:35,440
uh to be professional or whatever but yeah that's actually true story i could probably find the

886
01:41:35,440 --> 01:41:46,240
video and share it um if you really wanted to see how good that preview was um we're under a timer so

887
01:41:46,240 --> 01:41:57,040
we are just gonna kind of right okay you need to look for the open gate and i get it wrong all

888
01:41:57,040 --> 01:42:02,000
the time but open gate and then take a no oh my god i get it wrong all the time do you know how

889
01:42:02,000 --> 01:42:06,960
many times i've freaking played this game and i do that every single time you'd think i'd learn

890
01:42:06,960 --> 01:42:18,880
honestly uh one day i'll learn but i have a fun factoid that i will tell you later once we get

891
01:42:18,880 --> 01:42:24,800
to that part of the thingy but uh this will not be the only time we are playing Assassin's Creed

892
01:42:24,800 --> 01:42:35,120
on this channel a Assassin's Creed brotherhood on this channel in particular um because i um have

893
01:42:35,120 --> 01:42:43,360
very much tism this game into submission and i don't know should i just ruin it you know what if

894
01:42:43,360 --> 01:42:50,720
you're here right now i think i'm allowed to ruin it so my birthday is the 10th of october

895
01:42:51,760 --> 01:42:58,240
um oh you must always grab this light the game will pretend like you can do it so october 10th is

896
01:42:58,240 --> 01:43:05,360
my donathan and you'll never guess what date uh gets mentioned in this video game october 10th

897
01:43:05,360 --> 01:43:13,200
so we're playing it on my donathan um and i get to nerd about the game all over again and i'm already

898
01:43:13,200 --> 01:43:20,320
beaming with happiness just thinking about it i was like oh no no no no i'm going to subject you

899
01:43:20,320 --> 01:43:26,560
this twice you will you will watch me play this game twice and be so happy about it

900
01:43:28,720 --> 01:43:34,800
um we're getting close to the main hall the main hall is where the last major part of the

901
01:43:34,800 --> 01:43:40,480
sequence comes in i'm glad the game didn't crash actually earlier because i've not really had i

902
01:43:40,480 --> 01:43:45,680
don't really experience any crashing after the wolf section once you've killed all the romuli guys

903
01:43:45,680 --> 01:43:52,400
then uh not once have i had the game crash on multiple playthroughs um this game was literally

904
01:43:52,400 --> 01:43:57,600
made for me for real for real like actually though like i mean how did they know like oh my god this

905
01:43:57,600 --> 01:44:06,800
is work um for safety i just follow this i think you maybe can jump off as a fire but uh i'm not

906
01:44:06,800 --> 01:44:15,920
risking the run i do not want to play this like section again it's not boring but hmm

907
01:44:17,440 --> 01:44:21,760
i'm trying to choose my words carefully as if the dev team are sitting here watching they're not

908
01:44:21,760 --> 01:44:28,640
um obviously every game section you have a preference for me being tamed to claim about

909
01:44:28,640 --> 01:44:33,520
isn't but i understand that they do have to introduce some sort of element like

910
01:44:34,320 --> 01:44:41,360
not to panic the player but if you were just to willfully glide through these areas then it might

911
01:44:41,920 --> 01:44:49,840
be quite boresome any boresoms there's a flag to the left we will not be collecting it there's

912
01:44:49,840 --> 01:44:54,320
also a treasure box up ahead again we're not going to be collecting it we are trying to get

913
01:44:54,320 --> 01:45:00,000
our eight-minute timer we have entered a cutscene and we will also have a foot set there this is

914
01:45:00,000 --> 01:45:05,760
the grand hall this is the last section and it's a nightmare if you mess up on it but uh i've done

915
01:45:05,760 --> 01:45:15,200
it quite a lot so the CEO of Ubisoft sitting in here like you're doing what to my game um

916
01:45:16,000 --> 01:45:23,360
um i always mess this bit up as well you need to look for this one in order to get inside

917
01:45:25,920 --> 01:45:36,160
this section um now Assassin's Creed was made long before the yellow paint so they use candle

918
01:45:36,160 --> 01:45:41,600
light and fixtures i'll show you one section that really highlights the old candle fixtures

919
01:45:42,240 --> 01:45:48,080
and we're about to break this so don't be shocked it's quite loud at the breaking

920
01:45:51,040 --> 01:45:55,040
yeah so the game will help you in case you mess up because they have been

921
01:45:55,760 --> 01:46:00,800
they know they've made it awkward so you saw that those treasure boxes you see that flag there

922
01:46:00,800 --> 01:46:05,120
again we're just gonna ignore it we're here for the speed run and we're not i actually don't know

923
01:46:05,120 --> 01:46:09,920
what the speed run of this game would be i assume it's probably like under three hours the first

924
01:46:09,920 --> 01:46:14,240
time i played this it took me so long to figure out where i had to go you have to go on the chair

925
01:46:15,200 --> 01:46:19,440
literally the chair and then this little pathetic beam do you know how long it took me to find this

926
01:46:19,440 --> 01:46:25,760
beam as a child like i started asking my mum for help because my mum plays Tomb Raider and she was

927
01:46:25,760 --> 01:46:31,760
like then you look at me straw day and i'm like mum you're smiling like i'm a child you can you

928
01:46:31,760 --> 01:46:39,920
must be able to see uh you must also grab a lot um to to like save yourself see this doesn't look

929
01:46:39,920 --> 01:46:46,400
like you should be able to grab it but if you hold b you can get it sorry i play xbox controller uh

930
01:46:46,400 --> 01:46:55,120
i don't know what it is for like ps uh four is it triangle no triangles why um

931
01:46:55,920 --> 01:46:57,040
but yeah

932
01:46:59,440 --> 01:47:03,760
we're almost there we're doing good for time we've not actually made any mistakes yet like

933
01:47:03,760 --> 01:47:08,880
such as falling off falling off is the oh man is she fell off okay okay dude you're done

934
01:47:08,880 --> 01:47:15,920
um it's the biggest mistake you can make in these time sequences uh but don't worry the game does

935
01:47:15,920 --> 01:47:22,800
try to resurrect you so this is the freaking jump that i've it's freaking humongous and it's you

936
01:47:22,800 --> 01:47:31,040
know you cannot make that in real life but we are perfect for times um and when you pick up

937
01:47:31,040 --> 01:47:37,280
the objective the timer stops so you could in theory go back and get all the stuff you missed

938
01:47:38,240 --> 01:47:44,880
however i am much more happier to continue on with the campaign but this is a tutorial section

939
01:47:44,880 --> 01:47:52,960
that's part of the main quest line um for the layer of Romulus which there are six total

940
01:47:54,000 --> 01:48:00,320
and it unlocks you special armor uh i personally don't actually go right we're gonna pick it up

941
01:48:00,320 --> 01:48:05,920
we're gonna pick it up so we're picking it up now so the timer has now officially stopped we are no

942
01:48:05,920 --> 01:48:12,800
longer under the eight minute timer so i leave my family's armor in here one of the finest sets

943
01:48:12,800 --> 01:48:20,080
ever made may you who finds it receive strength and battle change of handwriting we have taken it

944
01:48:20,080 --> 01:48:26,720
and set it back behind the iron door six keys unlock it spread amongst our brothers it shall

945
01:48:26,720 --> 01:48:33,840
be said to come from your Romulus and they will worship it and we have a picture of the armor

946
01:48:33,840 --> 01:48:39,920
that we may unlock at a later time again i don't normally unlock it through my like first playthrough

947
01:48:39,920 --> 01:48:44,320
it's not necessary it's a bit time consuming as well it's probably like an extra hour so the

948
01:48:44,320 --> 01:48:50,960
timer is paused if i pause the game time remaining 133 so yeah we can pick up all these treasure

949
01:48:50,960 --> 01:48:58,080
boxes because we're gonna need it you get florins in this game and the campaign actually requires

950
01:48:58,080 --> 01:49:05,120
you to have 3,500 florins at one section um and we just want to make sure we go above and beyond

951
01:49:05,120 --> 01:49:12,560
because we cannot invest in like properties for example that part comes very soon um

952
01:49:14,480 --> 01:49:20,800
how kind of them to write in clear uh yeah detail for us to read their uh evil plans basically

953
01:49:20,800 --> 01:49:28,640
but there we go ancient roman tomowers would you like to taste my ancient roman tomato

954
01:49:29,520 --> 01:49:36,880
that tomato at golden boy achievement unlock so we've done one that's one layer of Romulus

955
01:49:39,760 --> 01:49:45,440
i'm gonna head off thank you for hanging please don't worry i believe shibi is coming up in an hour

956
01:49:46,880 --> 01:49:49,360
no in 10 minutes who's coming up next

957
01:49:53,520 --> 01:49:57,680
i'm going to take a drink i believe the gorgeous are supporting them is that where the ketchup

958
01:49:57,920 --> 01:50:03,920

959
01:50:03,920 --> 01:50:10,160

960
01:50:10,160 --> 01:50:14,800
was supposed to be ledger because they are transmitting them because i'm an endurance streamer i'd

961
01:50:14,800 --> 01:50:20,880
rather you support them we have nothing sometimes logic is not the only way to are you also an older

962
01:50:21,520 --> 01:50:28,560
yes you said we had allies in the city bring me to them okay this is a beautiful quest

963
01:50:30,640 --> 01:50:34,320
it's a beautiful quest and it has include revelation yes you play a much older etio i

964
01:50:34,320 --> 01:50:38,000
think you're like 70 years old technically and you're like jumping about paragliding and stuff and

965
01:50:38,000 --> 01:50:44,080
it's like really um they really stretch the old dates to make sure they could get them in this

966
01:50:44,640 --> 01:50:53,680
um see you tonight when mercy rates into you honestly though gilf etio

967
01:50:56,640 --> 01:51:02,800
brotherhood is etio and his prime for you for it he's like 42 or 41 i believe in this game

968
01:51:03,360 --> 01:51:05,280
bit of an old man but hey

969
01:51:06,160 --> 01:51:15,840
okay we're about to unlock the next sequence it's so good

970
01:51:17,760 --> 01:51:23,440
so the map of roma is massive but there's guards everywhere so he's telling us if you use the

971
01:51:23,440 --> 01:51:28,800
aqueducts you can move about real quick so we are going to use the aqueduct right now to get to

972
01:51:28,800 --> 01:51:35,360
island tebarina and this is where the sassans are based on on the map in roma

973
01:51:38,880 --> 01:51:42,960
when mercs aired in stream stroneys just finished the intro yapping of the story

974
01:51:42,960 --> 01:51:51,600
honestly oh my god azerid it's so well on her 2.0 she's fantastic with all her yapping

975
01:51:52,160 --> 01:51:55,840
i think someone said yep for corn and i was like well that's pretty smart i like that

976
01:51:56,400 --> 01:52:02,080
i've heard a great deal about him from my cousin so he's not really in this at all

977
01:52:03,360 --> 01:52:08,800
fabio i feel like he might have been dlc content or something he has two seats in this game

978
01:52:09,600 --> 01:52:20,240
and yeah i don't know what i'd rather confuse i hope we will be free

979
01:52:20,640 --> 01:52:27,920
she will occurs i wonder why i picked a zura

980
01:52:35,920 --> 01:52:40,160
what are you also unaware that the borja have captured the apple have eaten

981
01:52:41,200 --> 01:52:42,640
oh i do have lost the apple

982
01:52:42,960 --> 01:52:48,160
so you do not know what goes on with our enemies do we at least have an underground here to work

983
01:52:48,160 --> 01:52:54,400
with no underground network found our mercenaries are ensnared in elusiva la volpe doesn't even talk

984
01:52:54,400 --> 01:53:00,320
to me we have girls working for us in a brothel frequented by cardinals oh my god is she be you're

985
01:53:00,320 --> 01:53:05,840
in my game but the madame there is okay no not that rather attend parties than further of course

986
01:53:06,720 --> 01:53:13,520
what about the city's thieves do they have a deal see but they refuse to talk to us i do not know why

987
01:53:15,680 --> 01:53:20,400
what are you going to do to make some friends make some friends ah such a good line

988
01:53:21,520 --> 01:53:24,880
because we're about to make three different allies of different districts we're about to

989
01:53:24,880 --> 01:53:28,400
make friends with the thieves we're about to make friends with the holes we're about to make friends

990
01:53:28,400 --> 01:53:37,040
with the mercenaries let's go it's a very good very good we also unlock notoriety in this as well

991
01:53:38,480 --> 01:53:45,200
um and we also unlock having little uh the achievement unlocked from in ruins

992
01:53:48,080 --> 01:53:54,640
make friends with the holes to the window the fighter the lover and the thief to the sweat

993
01:53:54,960 --> 01:54:02,400
drop off my boss oh ski ski mother you want a scottish cover of that song

994
01:54:05,120 --> 01:54:10,000
right we are going to do the eagle point right now just so we can kind of see what's going on around

995
01:54:10,000 --> 01:54:23,520
island tibirina please do right so we are going to purposely do the thieves last the reason for

996
01:54:23,520 --> 01:54:29,680
the thieves last is because it introduces notoriety so guards are going to start harassing us a bit

997
01:54:29,680 --> 01:54:37,680
more um heralds are going to start talking about the devious acts that xio has committed and we're

998
01:54:37,680 --> 01:54:45,760
also going to have witnesses that have falsified their testimonies you didn't falsify your testimony

999
01:54:45,760 --> 01:54:58,320
to me we've also been introduced to the bank um where we can get money for investing in the city

1000
01:54:58,320 --> 01:55:06,000
every 20 minutes we will get our little 20 or cut from investing in these places um

1001
01:55:07,520 --> 01:55:14,400
and we have withdrawn four to eight florins we are rich we're rich we're rich any you played that game

01:58:07,840 --> 01:58:14,400
do i get up here um we are going to unlock what's called a leaping glove um which means we can do

1030
01:58:14,400 --> 01:58:19,200
very very big jumps uh unfortunately we can't do it at this section of the tower so we're gonna have

1031
01:58:19,200 --> 01:58:27,120
to drop down and reclaim it a different area we unlock that in sequence four i think at the end

1032
01:58:27,120 --> 01:58:33,520
of sequence four i can't remember um but it means we can jump things uh very easily and it makes

1033
01:58:33,520 --> 01:58:40,560
claiming much faster because right now it's a wee bit slow but it's fine um time to work please

1045
02:00:01,680 --> 02:00:08,880
to check out sheepsters uh i'm just doing brotherhood for the rest of the day so have fun enjoyer and uh

1046
02:00:09,520 --> 02:00:13,760
uh oh this is the dead end i always forget the section uh normally recruitment's actually

1047
02:00:13,760 --> 02:00:17,920
spawning those sections and they're so annoying to try and get them do a barrel roll literally

1048
02:00:19,760 --> 02:00:24,720
yes oh i'm getting i'm getting shanked oh yeah oh yeah i'm getting picked up by thieves right this

1049
02:00:25,680 --> 02:00:32,000
this isn't a part of the lame ill for these skinny agile guys you must take out your small

1050
02:00:32,000 --> 02:00:37,680
weapon drapes swords as well work but um yes you had so you have to wait until they attack you

1051
02:00:37,680 --> 02:00:41,680
basically because they're so agile it's such a and then you can do that but

1052
02:00:44,240 --> 02:00:48,080
oh my god oh i don't want the guards to see me with this body we're just gonna go straight into

1053
02:00:48,080 --> 02:00:58,480
the memory to win the guards to make the bodies on me it was fun hanging yes have fun with sheepsters

1054
02:01:02,080 --> 02:01:04,640
bye bye thanks for hanging do you know where she is

1055
02:01:06,400 --> 02:01:17,600
multi-stream drift that means help in attack oh my god she got her look at her nose she got

1056
02:01:17,600 --> 02:01:23,680
a nose job look at that peak on that nose that's beautiful i will get her back

1057
02:01:25,120 --> 02:01:32,320
beautiful beautiful oh i really need to pee not gonna lie can i need to pee um maybe after

1058
02:01:32,320 --> 02:01:38,960
i finish this act we can go pee if you see top left it says like i've got 5 000 florans but i

1059
02:01:38,960 --> 02:01:46,080
need 2.5 it must be 3k for the banker uh sequence but that's not yet the banker comes later um

1060
02:01:46,080 --> 02:01:51,840
banker is a later act we are currently doing the lover the thief and the fighter

1061
02:01:54,240 --> 02:02:01,520
okay now that i've noticed i need to pee i really need to pee um uh brain psychology have you heard

1062
02:02:01,520 --> 02:02:06,880
of this uh do you want to maybe not i'm a bit rude we are just gonna run normally you can just

1063
02:02:06,880 --> 02:02:14,880
take a horse over this section but i find they've spawned a wee bit too much people to like walk

1064
02:02:14,880 --> 02:02:19,360
around and the horse really struggles to go in between like the streets especially if there's

1065
02:02:19,360 --> 02:02:25,120
narrow sections whereas etio can just straight up jump over uh so we will be just doing that

1066
02:02:27,680 --> 02:02:35,920
self-fulfilling prophecy i need to pee oh my god weapons if we all pee together at the same time

1067
02:02:35,920 --> 02:02:41,360
will we like affect the water like flush system why did you take out the sword etio i

1068
02:02:41,840 --> 02:02:46,720
he just poked him in that eye etio that was that was a lot oh

1069
02:02:48,320 --> 02:02:52,720
whoopsies i actually didn't mean to do that i literally just smacked my mouth i didn't mean

1070
02:02:52,720 --> 02:02:58,000
to kill him i'm sorry you're just trying to get your paycheck for your wife and kids and i've just

1071
02:02:58,000 --> 02:03:06,400
like literally made made her a widow oh don't really feel good about that one so this is a

1072
02:03:06,400 --> 02:03:16,240
borger zone it's actually really annoying do we do the borger zone before we do this

1073
02:03:17,920 --> 02:03:22,160
no we won't i can't be arsed we'll come back to this zone it's a lot easier when you have recruits

1074
02:03:22,720 --> 02:03:28,320
have you come for the whore are you here for the whore close enough are you dancing to me

1075
02:03:28,320 --> 02:03:38,400
it's what happens at football halftime oh i heard that hey let oh my god i don't remember this part

1076
02:03:38,400 --> 02:03:43,600
right again no way did you see the four things behind me soldiers are about to board this boat as

1077
02:03:43,600 --> 02:03:52,400
well okay you must loot the bodies oh i forgot to loot the body oh that's nice oh why are the freaking

1078
02:03:53,120 --> 02:03:54,000
now

1079
02:03:57,360 --> 02:04:03,280
energy pro okay so we're gonna look the bodies of the thieves because they normally have unique

1080
02:04:03,280 --> 02:04:10,000
items like elf and ivory 200 coins i thought it was a bit more than that uh yeah vlad then

1081
02:04:10,000 --> 02:04:17,360
paler coins um these items can be traded at shops for special items who goes there identify yourself

1082
02:04:17,360 --> 02:04:28,400
um and after completing this quest we unlock courtesans which can distract guards um they are

1083
02:04:28,400 --> 02:04:36,960
very vital to a later campy a later sequence uh actually the banker sequence which i previously

1084
02:04:36,960 --> 02:04:43,120
mentioned is when they are vital and a part of the gameplay you can also get favors done by them i

1085
02:04:43,120 --> 02:04:50,560
don't mean like that because they're courtesans i mean like so the base price to hire a group is 150

1086
02:04:50,560 --> 02:04:58,320
florans but if you wow them uh you can get a discount rate of 75 florans i've made that sound so

1087
02:04:58,320 --> 02:05:05,280
weird i know but it's the gameplay um the thieves if you upgrade them and impress them the thieves

1088
02:05:05,280 --> 02:05:12,640
will pick pocket naturally as you walk through clouds but it's a little bit more it's not awkward

1089
02:05:12,640 --> 02:05:20,880
to get the thieves favor they just have a few more unique um a few more unique things you have to do

1090
02:05:20,880 --> 02:05:25,200
i will explain it when we once we unlock it we're about to unlock it right now and it'll make more

1091
02:05:25,200 --> 02:05:33,280
sense um but we're basically making generic allies and soon we will make brotherhood allies which are

1092
02:05:33,280 --> 02:05:39,200
assassin allies and they will help your gameplay if you feel like you are a weak gamer or you're just

1093
02:05:39,280 --> 02:05:45,680
not there with it with timing and like things if the games are going too fast you're i can't keep up

1094
02:05:45,680 --> 02:05:51,040
this is the kind of game for you once you know what you're doing and get used to the controls

1095
02:05:51,040 --> 02:05:58,560
because once you unlock assassin recruits your life is so much easier from there it's it's bliss

1096
02:05:58,560 --> 02:06:04,320
it's a dream it's one of those games where not everything has to be on you in order to progress

1097
02:06:04,320 --> 02:06:09,680
and that these are my kind of games okay i don't want to feel stressed out uh if i don't hit that

1098
02:06:09,680 --> 02:06:16,960
you can quickly loot this little box that's on the balcony here uh 75 for a whole group of them

1099
02:06:16,960 --> 02:06:22,320
damn no wonder strongy only was 100 for the ace of wire but could you imagine if a con would let us

1100
02:06:22,320 --> 02:06:31,760
do that though i think we'd get kicked out i'm not gonna lie not that i'm insinuating anything

1101
02:06:31,760 --> 02:06:43,040
would occur in the booth but i feel like i do not know things may go hand quickly uh

1102
02:06:45,920 --> 02:06:48,560
oh is there sister and her mom they're in roma now

1103
02:06:52,560 --> 02:06:54,560
you cannot close i need your help

1104
02:06:55,520 --> 02:07:00,720
he he good morning good good morning good afternoon and good evening oh yes good morning

1105
02:07:00,720 --> 02:07:03,760
good afternoon no good morning good evening good afternoon there we go that's

1106
02:07:08,640 --> 02:07:15,280
so claudia is currently she be gone bum because she's about to run a grotella the blooming rose

1107
02:07:17,040 --> 02:07:23,120
why do these ladies have horns that was the style back and then they did their research these are

1108
02:07:23,120 --> 02:07:28,720
the hairstyles uh at the time good morning good evening and good night did i say the wrong way

1109
02:07:29,600 --> 02:07:38,320
sorry i'm a wee bit slow so we are now about to renovate this lovely location

1110
02:07:38,880 --> 02:07:44,880
and our sister claudia is going to run it and we now have favor with the courtesans

1111
02:07:46,000 --> 02:07:52,560
uh the rose that infuriate the blooming rose or something like that um there's a flag at the

1112
02:07:52,560 --> 02:07:58,800
top you can actually see it shimmering right now very slightly um but we're about to go insane

1113
02:08:00,560 --> 02:08:08,560
gentle called the blooming rose honestly though there are cons in Glasgow that would let you do xd

1114
02:08:10,480 --> 02:08:13,920
we were talking about like actually coming to physical cons

1115
02:08:13,920 --> 02:08:20,640
the most popular brothel in roma rose in fjord well invested here i keep a list of the skills

1116
02:08:20,640 --> 02:08:26,160
taught to my girls you're not gonna need them much think you could do better

1117
02:08:26,160 --> 02:08:33,120
no problem that's you the board job make it difficult for claudia's girls there are several

1118
02:08:33,120 --> 02:08:40,400
things you could do that would aid them i will keep that you can do side quest for the brotella

1119
02:08:40,400 --> 02:08:49,520
with your mum or whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa no no she assigns you quest

1120
02:08:51,360 --> 02:08:56,480
you do not do a quest with your mum in the game okay

1121
02:08:59,920 --> 02:09:06,080
apologies right okay so as i was talking about you can kind of level them up you can be given

1122
02:09:06,080 --> 02:09:11,440
assignments so right now it costs 150 florins to highlight uh to hire a group of girls um

1123
02:09:12,640 --> 02:09:20,080
send 10 guards distracted hide bodies um poison uh assassinate from blind spots

1124
02:09:20,080 --> 02:09:24,240
assassinate from behind smoke bomb we've not unlocked smoke bomb yet that comes later

1125
02:09:24,240 --> 02:09:30,320
but you can do these and gain favour with the factions and it makes your gameplay a lot easier

1126
02:09:31,280 --> 02:09:40,800
um right next we are going to actually factually do the mercenaries which is this one i'm just

1127
02:09:40,800 --> 02:09:47,920
highlighting it on the map so i don't get confused yes it is very far away um however

1128
02:09:49,200 --> 02:09:56,320
well we can just run there i think i can't take a horse and i cannot take the aqueduct because

1129
02:09:57,040 --> 02:10:01,920
as soon as you summon the horse you basically get walled off by the layout of the map which is fine

1130
02:10:01,920 --> 02:10:07,120
because we're literally in an area where people are supposed to be living and thriving and doing

1131
02:10:07,120 --> 02:10:12,400
things so yeah horses aren't really supposed to just roll all the way through though this is a lost

1132
02:10:12,400 --> 02:10:16,640
memory of uh the girl that got away but we're not gonna do it right now we're gonna do it at the

1133
02:10:16,640 --> 02:10:23,760
end i do apologize if you're really interested in the story uh what's her name chris christina

1134
02:10:23,760 --> 02:10:32,640
is her name um but that sad part comes in later uh it is a very unfavourable and sad memory so i

1135
02:10:32,640 --> 02:10:39,360
like leaving it to the end i'd rather just focus on the happy times only 500 more meters to go

1136
02:10:41,200 --> 02:10:48,480
christina i knew it was christina yeah this game as much as i'll meme about the render distance

1137
02:10:48,560 --> 02:10:53,920
like as soon as you get closer to someone i've just added so much time going this way whatever um

1138
02:10:55,440 --> 02:11:00,400
i'm like i'm trying to find the main freaking road but i can't find it it's really annoying

1139
02:11:00,400 --> 02:11:04,560
okay i found the main road and i'm about to go off it yippee oh i didn't mean to do that

1140
02:11:04,560 --> 02:11:10,960
swap to my sword oh this entire zone's red and i'm not strong enough to kill him we are

1141
02:11:11,760 --> 02:11:17,280
did we just run through the area to save us time to be honest

1142
02:11:19,760 --> 02:11:25,360
no no i'm not stopping you can't make me go away you stink stinky stinky guard

1143
02:11:26,000 --> 02:11:31,200
we'll come back once we unlock recruits um i can't get over your accent thanks respond in with it uh

1144
02:11:31,760 --> 02:11:36,880
if you'd like to visit Glasgow please do please support our economy because it's in absolute shambles

1145
02:11:36,880 --> 02:11:44,320

the highest rate places to get stabbed however rate is one of the friendliest as well in europe

1153
02:12:30,320 --> 02:12:36,480
all of europe i don't know i don't know what it is what it is okay we made it we made it

1154
02:12:37,120 --> 02:12:44,240
we are about to meet Bartolomeo the owner i guess of the mercenary guild

1155
02:12:44,240 --> 02:12:51,920

i should force her to make an ASMR french collab with me but i like purposely put my accent on

1162
02:13:32,320 --> 02:13:41,440
and she's just cringing in the corner don't forget to stretch yes uh i will need to educate you guys

1163
02:13:42,640 --> 02:13:46,880
on why we need to stretch our legs to make sure we don't have a bit of veins

1164
02:13:50,240 --> 02:13:51,120
our position is weak

1165
02:13:51,520 --> 02:13:54,960
if you can defeat them we can concentrate our forces on the french round

1166
02:14:03,600 --> 02:14:07,200
so i will educate you right now my lovely jubblies

1167
02:14:08,480 --> 02:14:15,680
did you know overwhelmingly the people that suffer from hemorrhoids which is a failure of a vein

1168
02:14:15,680 --> 02:14:21,360
in your booty hole is office workers because they sit down for long periods of time so i always

1169
02:14:21,360 --> 02:14:27,680
recommend stretching often or standing up we are all about to go for a pee break and i recommend

1170
02:14:27,680 --> 02:14:33,280
you all get up with me um sorry that i never explained that mission there if you kill only

1171
02:14:33,280 --> 02:14:37,920
the captain you get a hundred percent super simple easy and you can also pick up a flag on the way

1172
02:14:38,880 --> 02:14:45,920
uh so yes uh we desire to not have any issues with our booty holes so i will recommend we stretch

1173
02:14:45,920 --> 02:14:51,040
roughly every two hours um i've no idea how long i've been streaming for but we should probably

1174
02:14:51,040 --> 02:14:56,320
dozen um the guards will not harass you at this area it's super easy and you can pick up this

1175
02:14:56,320 --> 02:15:06,080
uh little treasure box it's phil yes um uh it's quite interesting like the knee uh this sounds

1176
02:15:06,160 --> 02:15:12,640
absolutely bizarre but the nature of hemorrhoids is quite interesting because it's literally just

1177
02:15:12,640 --> 02:15:17,440
what side am i supposed to climb up i can't get up there um it's literally just a vein in your

1178
02:15:17,440 --> 02:15:22,160
booty hole that's you know failed and there's nothing really more to it it's just like adios

1179
02:15:22,160 --> 02:15:28,240
i'm out and then that's what hemorrhoid is and you just get a cream and you know put it on your

1180
02:15:28,240 --> 02:15:32,400
butt and then it goes away it's really bizarre or if you're someone like it's a really a shame

1181
02:15:32,400 --> 02:15:37,440
i've like heard stories like people who suffer uh you need to like get on operation on your butt

1182
02:15:38,160 --> 02:15:46,880
but um yeah i don't know i just sorry i'm just vomiting about like biology and diagnosis and

1183
02:15:46,880 --> 02:15:57,280
stuff so yeah i am not expecting these topics a conversation and so i do apologize do we go left

1184
02:15:57,360 --> 02:16:01,120
or right here i actually i think yeah we were supposed to go left okay

1185
02:16:03,840 --> 02:16:09,840
the butthole though yes you you will have the healthiest booty hole uh enjoying my streams

1186
02:16:10,400 --> 02:16:18,240
because we will have healthy butts together uh okay first synchronize the viewpoint and then

1187
02:16:18,240 --> 02:16:23,360
ignite the board your tower do not ignite the board your tower first because the viewpoint

1188
02:16:23,360 --> 02:16:29,120
will not register and you will have to claim the tower all over again once you have done a tower

1189
02:16:29,120 --> 02:16:34,560
you never have to go back up it there is no uh treasure chest added on top of the tower there

1190
02:16:34,560 --> 02:16:45,200
are no flags added on top of the tower um yes i don't worry i love every second of your conversation

1191
02:16:45,200 --> 02:16:52,480
yeah i do like my conversational topic uh the game will always give you a way up fast if

1192
02:16:53,360 --> 02:16:57,280
they've kind of put you in a thingy because they literally leave you in the water after that

1193
02:16:57,280 --> 02:17:03,680
sequence and i was like okay then i guess we will call a horse very quickly or we'll steal a horse

1194
02:17:03,680 --> 02:17:12,240
but a really strange developmental fact is um depending on the horse's color depends on its

1195
02:17:12,240 --> 02:17:20,320
speed in the game the lighter and whiter the horses the slower it is and then obviously it goes up to

1196
02:17:20,320 --> 02:17:24,720
all the way to a black horse and a black horse is the fastest horse you can get in the game

1197
02:17:24,720 --> 02:17:29,760
i don't know why the developers did it like that um but i noticed it as soon as i like started

1198
02:17:29,760 --> 02:17:34,800
playing the game i was like huh why did they do this it seems like such a random thing um

1199
02:17:35,680 --> 02:17:40,080
but we're on a dark brown horse which is the second fastest so we got here lickety split

1200
02:17:40,080 --> 02:17:46,160
but if you can somehow memorize the speed of that horse when we get on a white one uh yeah

1201
02:17:46,160 --> 02:17:51,120
it'll be so slow in comparison now that the pope's dogs have fled we're talking about horses

1202
02:17:51,120 --> 02:17:58,960
still right yeah it's great play the game i will show you literally i don't know why the devs

1203
02:17:58,960 --> 02:18:03,360
don't know well when you approve the fact that's a true fact i don't that's group of things

1204
02:18:06,800 --> 02:18:13,440
oh yeah my all account got restricted and i had to pass like a 10 sec like 10 captures and i can't

1205
02:18:13,440 --> 02:18:18,400
be bothered doing it so my account's just restricted right now i'm so freaking lazy it like makes me do

1206
02:18:18,400 --> 02:18:25,120
like these 10 things over and over and i failed it the first time and i'm like go and stop playing

1207
02:18:26,240 --> 02:18:32,240
like you know full well i'm a human all i did was retweet someone artwork of me and then it

1208
02:18:32,240 --> 02:18:40,000
blocked my account again i've done it like three times now i keep getting it like horses are like

1209
02:18:40,000 --> 02:18:49,360
cars red car go first as you can see this board shows the ranks of our top warrior again uh same

1210
02:18:49,360 --> 02:18:54,480
thing as before if we improve the mercenaries they get cheaper i don't know if they get more effective

1211
02:18:54,480 --> 02:18:59,840
cannot prove that i don't know if they get more aggressive and successful you also have fun

1212
02:19:00,560 --> 02:19:07,120
now if you'll excuse me a bit silly in it yes it's silly brb you got walk home please do not get

1213
02:19:07,120 --> 02:19:15,200
snatched on your way home where is bartholomeo at the fight downstairs he has such an aggressive

1214
02:19:15,200 --> 02:19:27,200
view of the world the red ones go faster oh we're unlocking assassin mission contracts as well

1215
02:19:27,200 --> 02:19:31,680
you get some florns on the side super easy super quick if you unlock your assassin signals

1216
02:19:31,680 --> 02:19:43,120
and do these really fast not a problem we will do a pee break in about like five minutes time

1217
02:19:44,160 --> 02:19:50,320
okay now we are going to be able to utilize the aqueduct in order to get a lot closer because

1218
02:19:50,320 --> 02:19:55,680
if you see the meters it says we're 1000 meters away we go to the island tabirina that's the

1219
02:19:55,680 --> 02:20:01,520
closest we have unlocked to the thieves at the moment it wasn't kind of the market

1220
02:20:03,760 --> 02:20:08,960
is that that may be true i actually don't know if they get more plentiful the like higher you

1221
02:20:08,960 --> 02:20:11,680
under your the higher like tier you are with them

1222
02:20:16,800 --> 02:20:22,080
jeez it's almost just killed myself from that board there goodness all right they came out

1223
02:20:22,080 --> 02:20:27,440
there we are we do have to run for this but again unless i take this guy's horse you don't want

1224
02:20:27,440 --> 02:20:36,800
mine now yonkers thank you very much please okay out my way so this is the problem if the if you

1225
02:20:36,800 --> 02:20:41,680
gallop through crowds the horse will fall over but if you just sprint through crowds the horse

1226
02:20:41,680 --> 02:20:50,320
won't fall over um literally we commit grand theft horse say apologies to that guy he probably

1227
02:20:50,320 --> 02:20:56,240
spent thousands of florns on the horse and i've just ran away with it and you get to keep the horse

1228
02:20:57,600 --> 02:21:00,720
i've still not unlocked targets so we're not going to do that we're just going to swim

1229
02:21:00,720 --> 02:21:08,000
across the water really quick we the pirate ship always stays after you have done that i don't know

1230
02:21:08,000 --> 02:21:16,160
why but the asset does get reused in a Leonardo mission so it's not like a massive waste so we

1231
02:21:16,160 --> 02:21:21,440
are now currently trying to run out of range of the horse that's across the water because if we

1232
02:21:21,440 --> 02:21:26,320
call on it it's going to try and okay there we go we're out of range so we can spawn in the horse

1233
02:21:26,320 --> 02:21:31,920
at any point but uh it will try to come over from the other side of the water and it can't

1234
02:21:31,920 --> 02:21:36,800
so you need to go out of range to despawn it and then you can respawn it on the other side

1235
02:21:37,680 --> 02:21:41,360
fucking hell this horse is zooming my god what kind of hay did we give it

1236
02:21:42,320 --> 02:21:51,200
it's so fat why are we going so fat i need to help it oh my god that was dangerous that was

1237
02:21:51,200 --> 02:21:54,800
dangerous like didn't even got a helmet on he's not even got we crashed pads on

1238
02:21:56,880 --> 02:22:01,680
this is Lavalpe the owner of the tea skill horse doping honestly

1239
02:22:01,920 --> 02:22:10,000
i know the answer you always do you want to put my spies to work then go in aiding

1240
02:22:10,000 --> 02:22:15,200
Machiavelli no thank you the horse really gotta go fast should have made it blue like

1241
02:22:15,200 --> 02:22:26,240
panic bang bang a wee baggie to the horse we baggie is slang for

1242
02:22:29,760 --> 02:22:36,400
yeah i think you can you can get the rest from there he is an assassin not a traitor

1243
02:22:37,200 --> 02:22:41,360
i am not convinced a what a wee baggie means

1244
02:22:46,240 --> 02:22:54,640
care to accompany me so Lavalpe thinks that Machiavelli is a traitor to the assassin's guild

1245
02:22:54,640 --> 02:23:02,160
which is the reason why Lavalpe refuses to communicate with Machiavelli uh can i get a

1246
02:23:02,160 --> 02:23:06,000
horse please because this is going to take a while to get to the location we need to get

1247
02:23:06,000 --> 02:23:13,360
hello let's go right let's get out of the way of the humans because the humans are in the way

1248
02:23:14,720 --> 02:23:21,840
um after this we gain notoriety unfortunately which means there are gonna be

1249
02:23:22,800 --> 02:23:26,400
posters put up about us and they kind of pop up on the map a bit too

1250
02:23:26,480 --> 02:23:28,960
a bit too much and they're always like above

1251
02:23:31,120 --> 02:23:36,480
money oh yeah we're at six thousand that's not honestly that's not bad

1252
02:23:37,520 --> 02:23:43,200
um we are gonna try and get a crossbow bolt you can unlock a crossbow bolt just like the archers

1253
02:23:43,200 --> 02:23:50,160
but you need to pay for it and i think it's 13 000 florins and if you decide to invest in buildings

1254
02:23:50,720 --> 02:23:57,120
like boot i keep saying butchers like the blacksmith for example and it does like

1255
02:23:57,760 --> 02:24:04,720
it adds up over time but it kind of is a bit difficult it's better to like save your money

1256
02:24:04,720 --> 02:24:13,040
for the quest because you can easily defeat the section after oh you like my twitter picture yeah

1257
02:24:13,040 --> 02:24:20,800
yeah i totally made it myself i did not make it i didn't make it at all i yanked it

1258
02:24:22,080 --> 02:24:30,640
okay okay this pay attention look at his body and look at him holding his arm please make note of

1259
02:24:30,640 --> 02:24:36,480
this as his i know it sounds crazy but i'm gonna talk about reusing assets and how genius it is

1260
02:24:36,480 --> 02:24:42,880
in video game development okay so he is hunched over and he's holding his arm please keep this in

1261
02:24:42,880 --> 02:24:52,160
your mind okay let's see if i can shoot everyone right you first right you next right you next okay

02:25:09,840 --> 02:25:15,200
beat you up right you next right you next that's basically what we just did okay now this section

1265
02:25:15,200 --> 02:25:21,120
is actually super easy it was really hard at first we might get caught because i'm he gets lost so

1266
02:25:21,120 --> 02:25:29,920
quickly but basically you have to hide here and then we're gonna wait for a group to walk up and

1267
02:25:29,920 --> 02:25:35,440
then they will see that group there that's coming towards us we hide in that group and then that's

1268
02:25:35,440 --> 02:25:40,800
it we've done this section of the game but please make a note of his body how he's holding his arm

1269
02:25:40,800 --> 02:25:45,920
and he's kind of hunched over because i'm gonna show you a reused asset you might not know about

1270
02:25:45,920 --> 02:25:50,240
wait why why is that group highlighted hold on a minute am i supposed to be with the other there's

1271
02:25:50,240 --> 02:25:58,400
too many groups please please okay you okay i hate this bit because the tree gets in the way

1272
02:25:58,400 --> 02:26:03,760
yes you heard me right the tree gets in the way and breaks up the group often but we're just gonna

1273
02:26:03,760 --> 02:26:14,080
blend in don't look at us guards we're just citizens i'm a monk amen amen i don't know what monks say

1274
02:26:15,600 --> 02:26:23,680
and then tada oh excuse me you are right there and he's like that could have desynchronized

1275
02:26:23,680 --> 02:26:27,120
because he got caught on those people i'm not even kidding i'm not kidding

1276
02:26:31,360 --> 02:26:37,040
analizing asset analizing well this asset be reused later yes it will

1277
02:26:41,200 --> 02:26:42,560
you know how to disappear

1278
02:26:43,120 --> 02:26:51,120
if you flora you know how to disappear heck yeah

1279
02:26:53,360 --> 02:26:57,840
okay we are gonna take a pee break right after we've done this bit because i need to pee

1280
02:27:00,400 --> 02:27:07,920
and i'm gonna get more water because i'm out of water already so these are witnesses we lose 75

1281
02:27:08,320 --> 02:27:13,360
percent notoriety if we do that and we are also going to complete a thieves challenge

1282
02:27:13,360 --> 02:27:20,800
which is drum roll please is to pick pocket 500 florins and a really quick way to do it is by this

you pick bribe him 500 and then yuck easy come easy go baby

1284

1285
02:27:36,160 --> 02:27:42,000
this point excuse me whilst i kill this other witness oh no there's guards you know what i can

1290
02:28:18,480 --> 02:28:24,000

1291
02:28:24,000 --> 02:28:30,000
like a third borja tower oh my goodness i can't believe the timing just happened

1294
02:28:44,640 --> 02:28:49,600
okay we're gonna burn this tower there are a few archers on the roof but uh they're not too much

1295
02:28:49,600 --> 02:28:55,120
of a bother all right you can just kind of you know unfortunately you do have this one's a bit

1296
02:28:55,120 --> 02:29:00,640
more awkward you have to like you have to like kill him and then you have to go up there and kill

1297
02:29:00,640 --> 02:29:08,480
this guy too and it's a bit annoying to navigate whoopsie oh wow i made that jump there's a guard

okay it's this act almost done yes we're gonna fix aqueducts in roma as well

1368
02:37:39,760 --> 02:37:45,120
apple juice or homemade slime

1369
02:37:48,800 --> 02:37:55,120

can have apple juice or homemade slime what would you like from this the cuttlefish

1371
02:38:00,080 --> 02:38:08,640

1372
02:38:10,000 --> 02:38:11,760
so someone can inhale it and be like

1373
02:38:15,280 --> 02:38:20,720
okay we did it fixer upper act four is when we get the brotherhood together officially

1374
02:38:20,720 --> 02:38:24,640

I keep wanting to call it the Butchers, the blacksmith.

1409
02:44:58,080 --> 02:45:02,080
Did you guys pee and get water and stretch your legs instead?

1410
02:45:06,080 --> 02:45:08,080
I don't even drink energy drinks.

1411
02:45:08,080 --> 02:45:12,080
I'm eating meat and trying to play at the same time.

1412
02:45:16,080 --> 02:45:18,080
My mouth is stuffed full of meat.

1413
02:45:24,080 --> 02:45:28,080
Beecherbers when they're trying to do the most clippiest bait clip I've ever heard.

1414
02:45:30,080 --> 02:45:32,080
My mouth is so full of meat.

1415
02:45:32,080 --> 02:45:36,080
We got it. We know what game you're playing. It's fine.

1416
02:45:44,080 --> 02:45:46,080
I'm finishing it.

1417
02:45:46,080 --> 02:45:48,080
Sorry for the people that don't like mouth sounds. I apologize.

1418
02:45:52,080 --> 02:45:56,080
I actually can't remember what happens in this sequence.

1419
02:45:56,080 --> 02:45:58,080
My brain is blanking.

1420
02:46:02,080 --> 02:46:06,080
Well, it looks like I should have taken the aqueduct.

1421
02:46:06,080 --> 02:46:08,080
We're going into the castello.

1422
02:46:08,080 --> 02:46:14,080
We're about to go see Catherine of Forley.

1423
02:46:14,080 --> 02:46:16,080
Catherine of Forley.

1424
02:46:16,080 --> 02:46:20,080
She's currently stuck in a jail. She's got the jail.

1425
02:46:20,080 --> 02:46:24,080
The police in Scotland have got polis.

1426
02:46:24,080 --> 02:46:28,080
Actually, that's how you say it in Gaelic as well.

1427
02:46:28,080 --> 02:46:30,080
You say polis.

1428
02:46:30,080 --> 02:46:32,080
What are you eating?

1429
02:46:32,080 --> 02:46:34,080
I said a stick of meat.

1430
02:46:34,080 --> 02:46:36,080
It's like a pepper-rami.

1431
02:46:36,080 --> 02:46:40,080
But it's called a twizzle stick or something.

1432
02:46:40,080 --> 02:46:42,080
Oh, shit, I don't want to get in trouble.

1433
02:46:42,080 --> 02:46:44,080
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1434
02:46:44,080 --> 02:46:46,080
Excuse me.

1435
02:46:46,080 --> 02:46:48,080
Come through.

1436
02:46:48,080 --> 02:46:50,080
That's what I didn't want to happen.

1437
02:46:50,080 --> 02:46:54,080
Because I'm literally just trying to get into a memory right now.

1438
02:46:54,080 --> 02:46:58,080
Excuse me. Pardon me. Didn't mean anything.

1439
02:46:58,080 --> 02:47:03,080
Well, you could've ignored me, but no, no, oh, are they still looking for me?

1440
02:47:03,080 --> 02:47:06,560
So that indicator means they're still looking, but they've not been coded to come down the

1441
02:47:06,560 --> 02:47:07,560
stairs or something?

1442
02:47:07,560 --> 02:47:11,680
Cause, yeah, they should've came down there, but they didn't.

1443
02:47:11,680 --> 02:47:14,080
Well I ain't complaining, I've never gotten in trouble, hee hee.

1444
02:47:14,080 --> 02:47:15,080
BOO!

1445
02:47:15,080 --> 02:47:18,080
Yeah, now, do you see that flashbang?

1446
02:47:18,080 --> 02:47:19,080
How does Haggis taste?

1447
02:47:19,080 --> 02:47:21,080
I actually really like it.

1448
02:47:22,080 --> 02:47:24,080
SHE HORROR FORLY!

1449
02:47:30,080 --> 02:47:33,080
I drinking lots of water to stop the neon.

1450
02:47:47,080 --> 02:47:48,080
What's Haggis?

1451
02:47:48,080 --> 02:47:50,080
Haggis is a meat dish.

1452
02:47:51,080 --> 02:47:54,080
I'll be free, your time will come, I swear it!

1453
02:47:54,080 --> 02:47:56,080
Keep your eyes on her eyes.

1454
02:47:56,080 --> 02:47:58,080
You're going to torture her.

1455
02:47:58,080 --> 02:48:01,080
You are here for Cesare and Rodrigo.

1456
02:48:02,080 --> 02:48:04,080
Girl spent in fire.

1457
02:48:04,080 --> 02:48:06,080
If we help her now while she is weak.

1458
02:48:06,080 --> 02:48:09,080
Haggis is a meat dish, a native national...

1459
02:48:09,080 --> 02:48:11,080
Let's kill Cesare and Rodrigo first.

1460
02:48:11,080 --> 02:48:14,080
It's not our national dish, I don't think.

1461
02:48:14,080 --> 02:48:16,080
Who goes there?

1462
02:48:16,080 --> 02:48:19,080
By the Pope.

1463
02:48:19,080 --> 02:48:23,080
I ate and I had a bit of water, so that didn't work.

1464
02:48:23,080 --> 02:48:29,080
It is, I believe, sheep liver and sheep lung mashed up.

1465
02:48:29,080 --> 02:48:33,080
And it's quite peppery, quite a peppery dish.

1466
02:48:33,080 --> 02:48:35,080
It's really nice.

1467
02:48:35,080 --> 02:48:38,080
You might have heard the phrase, neeps and tatis.

1468
02:48:38,080 --> 02:48:40,080
That means potatoes and turnip.

1469
02:48:40,080 --> 02:48:42,080
And it's just like a nice mash together.

1470
02:48:42,080 --> 02:48:43,080
It's really nice, I like it.

1471
02:48:43,080 --> 02:48:47,080
Okay, so this one's like, don't get caught, but I couldn't get...

1472
02:48:48,080 --> 02:48:50,080
What will they do?

1473
02:48:50,080 --> 02:48:52,080
Don't get detected later?

1474
02:48:52,080 --> 02:48:54,080
Because I actually don't even know how to do it.

1475
02:48:54,080 --> 02:48:56,080
So we're going to do it for the first time together.

1476
02:48:56,080 --> 02:49:00,080
I've never done this section without being caught.

1477
02:49:00,080 --> 02:49:04,080
I assume maybe if I had a crossbow and it can kill from afar and resupply.

1478
02:49:04,080 --> 02:49:06,080
Isn't Haggis a wee rodent?

1479
02:49:06,080 --> 02:49:09,080
Oh, aye, it's a wee animal.

1480
02:49:14,080 --> 02:49:16,080
Haggis is mainly pork, is it?

1481
02:49:18,080 --> 02:49:25,080
I don't think it's easily accessible, like, outside of the United Kingdom.

1482
02:49:25,080 --> 02:49:29,080
It is referred to as blood pudding.

1483
02:49:29,080 --> 02:49:30,080
Oh, no, that's black.

1484
02:49:30,080 --> 02:49:32,080
Black pudding is different.

1485
02:49:32,080 --> 02:49:38,080
For breakfast, we do like, it's a discus.

1486
02:49:38,080 --> 02:49:43,080
So on the way, a discus of, it's called black pudding,

1487
02:49:43,080 --> 02:49:46,080
but Americans refer to it as blood pudding.

1488
02:49:46,080 --> 02:49:49,080
But it is made of blood, so I do understand why they call it that.

1489
02:49:49,080 --> 02:49:52,080
It's just we call it, it just sounds a bit barbaric.

1490
02:49:52,080 --> 02:49:57,080
But at the same time, it's like, well, we are eating, you know what I mean?

1491
02:49:57,080 --> 02:49:59,080
No one cares.

1492
02:50:01,080 --> 02:50:04,080
Greetings, greetings.

1493
02:50:04,080 --> 02:50:06,080
You really say greens?

1494
02:50:08,080 --> 02:50:10,080
Alright, let's kill him from above.

1495
02:50:10,080 --> 02:50:12,080
Thank you very much.

1496
02:50:12,080 --> 02:50:15,080
We are going to have to come back on this.

1497
02:50:16,080 --> 02:50:21,080
Haggis is a savoury pudding containing sheeps,

1498
02:50:21,080 --> 02:50:27,080
sheeps pluck, minced with chopped onion, oatmeal, the spices and salt mixed with stock

1499
02:50:27,080 --> 02:50:29,080
and cooked with traditional, da da da da da.

1500
02:50:29,080 --> 02:50:33,080
I don't know how I could do that in the corner of my eye, but here you go.

1501
02:50:33,080 --> 02:50:38,080
I actually played this game so many times, I'm like completely sequenced out the wazoo.

1502
02:50:38,080 --> 02:50:42,080
But yeah, I'm a bit confused how you're supposed to do this section

1503
02:50:42,080 --> 02:50:44,080
without being caught without a crossbow.

1504
02:50:44,080 --> 02:50:47,080
I think we'll get access to the crossbow when we replay the memory.

1505
02:50:48,080 --> 02:50:51,080
Oh no, go away. See that's the thing.

1506
02:50:51,080 --> 02:50:54,080
Oh my god, no, no, no.

1507
02:50:54,080 --> 02:51:01,080
By the skin of our teeth, did that man not shoot?

1508
02:51:01,080 --> 02:51:05,080
Oh my gosh.

1509
02:51:05,080 --> 02:51:11,080
By the skill, by the skin of our teeth, by our gamer skills as well.

1510
02:51:11,080 --> 02:51:13,080
Yes, I give it to my gamer skills.

1511
02:51:14,080 --> 02:51:16,080
Oh my gosh.

1512
02:51:16,080 --> 02:51:19,080
Must have been the wind, literally.

1513
02:51:19,080 --> 02:51:21,080
Their brother and sister, by the way.

1514
02:51:30,080 --> 02:51:32,080
How it left so shut.

1515
02:51:32,080 --> 02:51:35,080
I'd rather like it open myself.

1516
02:51:37,080 --> 02:51:41,080
Have you talked to the Pope about the funds requested by my banker?

1517
02:51:41,080 --> 02:51:43,080
He is away from the Castello.

1518
02:51:43,080 --> 02:51:46,080
I do need some convincing when he returns.

1519
02:51:46,080 --> 02:51:48,080
That shouldn't be a problem.

1520
02:51:48,080 --> 02:51:50,080
Should it?

1521
02:51:50,080 --> 02:51:52,080
I wish that was me for real, for real.

1522
02:51:52,080 --> 02:51:55,080
Only it gets quite lonely here.

1523
02:51:55,080 --> 02:51:58,080
You and I spend so little time together.

1524
02:51:58,080 --> 02:52:01,080
Busy as you are with your other conquests.

1525
02:52:01,080 --> 02:52:05,080
Once I have secured the throne of Italia,

1526
02:52:05,080 --> 02:52:10,080
you are going to be my queen and your loneliness.

1527
02:52:10,080 --> 02:52:12,080
We'll be a thing of the past.

1528
02:52:12,080 --> 02:52:14,080
Ashight, baby.

1529
02:52:14,080 --> 02:52:16,080
Oh!

1530
02:52:16,080 --> 02:52:18,080
A bit of hair yonking.

1531
02:52:18,080 --> 02:52:19,080
We need to tag this up.

1532
02:52:19,080 --> 02:52:21,080
We need to tag this stream up to high heaven.

1533
02:52:21,080 --> 02:52:25,080
We've got hair yonking, we've got kissing, we've got bin best.

1534
02:52:25,080 --> 02:52:28,080
A lot of things going on.

1535
02:52:28,080 --> 02:52:31,080
I'm not to go up, I think I'm to swing to the side.

1536
02:52:31,080 --> 02:52:33,080
Yeah, surely.

1537
02:52:33,080 --> 02:52:35,080
Imagine if I went the wrong way.

1538
02:52:35,080 --> 02:52:37,080
Right now.

1539
02:52:37,080 --> 02:52:39,080
Hold B and then you just grab onto everything.

1540
02:52:39,080 --> 02:52:42,080
You can go down and speak things of it.

1541
02:52:42,080 --> 02:52:44,080
And what was it?

1542
02:52:44,080 --> 02:52:49,080
His ball was like one black thing shriveled up or something like that.

1543
02:52:49,080 --> 02:52:52,080
That Spaniard guy.

1544
02:52:52,080 --> 02:52:55,080
The Spanish were wild then.

1545
02:52:56,080 --> 02:52:58,080
To even get to that stage.

1546
02:52:58,080 --> 02:53:01,080
Not going to lie, not going to lie.

1547
02:53:01,080 --> 02:53:03,080
Who goes there?

1548
02:53:03,080 --> 02:53:05,080
Identify yourself.

1549
02:53:05,080 --> 02:53:07,080
What do we need to go up?

1550
02:53:07,080 --> 02:53:09,080
Square Sausage.

1551
02:53:09,080 --> 02:53:11,080
I miss square sausage.

1552
02:53:11,080 --> 02:53:15,080
If you didn't know, in Chicky Scotland for breakfast you do square sausage

1553
02:53:15,080 --> 02:53:19,080
and it's literally a square of sausage meat.

1554
02:53:19,080 --> 02:53:21,080
I wish it.

1555
02:53:21,080 --> 02:53:24,080
And I have it on a rolled way onion.

1556
02:53:24,080 --> 02:53:26,080
Didn't you just have his private...

1557
02:53:26,080 --> 02:53:28,080
I can't remember.

1558
02:53:38,080 --> 02:53:43,080
Whammin' on whammin' violence.

1559
02:53:43,080 --> 02:53:46,080
It can be.

1560
02:53:46,080 --> 02:53:48,080
You can put tomato sauce on it.

1561
02:53:48,080 --> 02:53:53,080
It's like tomato sauce, fried onion in square sausage on a roll.

1562
02:53:53,080 --> 02:53:54,080
Simple.

1563
02:53:54,080 --> 02:53:56,080
Simple, bruv.

1564
02:53:56,080 --> 02:53:58,080
Can I get more simple on that?

1565
02:53:58,080 --> 02:54:00,080
Right on the hip as well.

1566
02:54:00,080 --> 02:54:02,080
Excuse me.

1567
02:54:02,080 --> 02:54:04,080
Sorry, that actually really hurt.

1568
02:54:04,080 --> 02:54:06,080
I need a safe word.

1569
02:54:06,080 --> 02:54:08,080
That actually really hurt.

1570
02:54:08,080 --> 02:54:10,080
Please don't do that again.

1571
02:54:10,080 --> 02:54:14,080
Right, I'm pretty sure for this sequence if you time it right

1572
02:54:14,080 --> 02:54:17,080
you can be like not detected by the guards somehow.

1573
02:54:17,080 --> 02:54:19,080
Yeah, like literally he doesn't...

1574
02:54:19,080 --> 02:54:26,080
Yeah, so at least we know that for when we do play the 100% not detection segment.

1575
02:54:26,080 --> 02:54:31,080
And then there should be a guard to our left.

1576
02:54:31,080 --> 02:54:36,080
Well, we don't need to not be detected right now so it's fine.

1577
02:54:36,080 --> 02:54:38,080
The safe word is more...

1578
02:54:38,080 --> 02:54:40,080
What do you think is still it?

1579
02:54:40,080 --> 02:54:44,080
Should be in the safe word for a sheepskater.

1580
02:54:44,080 --> 02:54:46,080
Can you reach this water jug for me?

1581
02:54:46,080 --> 02:54:49,080
Okay, kill that guard first and then kill him.

1582
02:54:49,080 --> 02:54:51,080
And then that'll be how we won't get detected.

1583
02:54:51,080 --> 02:54:53,080
Surely.

1584
02:54:53,080 --> 02:54:55,080
Yay!

1585
02:54:55,080 --> 02:54:57,080
Castello crashing.

1586
02:54:57,080 --> 02:54:59,080
Paying a visit to the tailor.

1587
02:54:59,080 --> 02:55:04,080
Brown sauce and I'm not brown sauce fan sauce.

1588
02:55:04,080 --> 02:55:08,080
A bit of Harry Potter sauce with HP sauce.

1589
02:55:08,080 --> 02:55:11,080
It's tomato sauce or ketchup?

1590
02:55:11,080 --> 02:55:13,080
I'm gonna say something really dumb.

1591
02:55:13,080 --> 02:55:20,080
I don't know the difference between tomato ketchup and tomato sauce and tomato ketchup.

1592
02:55:20,080 --> 02:55:23,080
Ain't they the same? Aren't they the same?

1593
02:55:23,080 --> 02:55:26,080
Aren't they the same?

1594
02:55:26,080 --> 02:55:31,080
Phil Sinkfield, yes, we will be coming back to Fully Sink later thing right now.

1595
02:55:31,080 --> 02:55:33,080
Oh my god, that poor guy.

1596
02:55:33,080 --> 02:55:36,080
I didn't even know he was in here. I thought she was the only one here.

1597
02:55:37,080 --> 02:55:42,080
Brand? One has sugar, one doesn't.

1598
02:55:42,080 --> 02:55:46,080
I guess tomato sauce is probably what I like then.

1599
02:55:46,080 --> 02:55:51,080
This section can be a little bit finicky.

1600
02:55:51,080 --> 02:55:53,080
I love you so.

1601
02:55:53,080 --> 02:55:56,080
I want to sing it from the heavens.

1602
02:55:56,080 --> 02:55:59,080
Please, you must whisper it only to yourself.

1603
02:55:59,080 --> 02:56:01,080
If Cesare found out who knows what he would do.

1604
02:56:01,080 --> 02:56:04,080
These hoes ain't loyal.

1605
02:56:04,080 --> 02:56:06,080
He killed my husband.

1606
02:56:06,080 --> 02:56:08,080
Oh.

1607
02:56:08,080 --> 02:56:11,080
He killed my husband.

1608
02:56:11,080 --> 02:56:13,080
For real, for real.

1609
02:56:13,080 --> 02:56:16,080
I'm late for rehearsal. Farewell, my love.

1610
02:56:16,080 --> 02:56:18,080
No, ketchup has way more sugar than other ingredients.

1611
02:56:18,080 --> 02:56:20,080
Oh my god, not kidding.

1612
02:56:20,080 --> 02:56:22,080
She got a point. Ketchup has a ton of sugar.

1613
02:56:22,080 --> 02:56:25,080
Okay, whatever the sugary one was, I like it.

1614
02:56:25,080 --> 02:56:27,080
Brain says yum.

1615
02:56:27,080 --> 02:56:30,080
We shall see how it feels when the shoe is on the other foot.

1616
02:56:30,080 --> 02:56:32,080
Oh.

1617
02:56:32,080 --> 02:56:34,080
She's playing.

1618
02:56:34,080 --> 02:56:36,080
She said, guess what?

1619
02:56:36,080 --> 02:56:39,080
I'm not the only one that's going cheating around here.

1620
02:56:42,080 --> 02:56:44,080
He loves me.

1621
02:56:44,080 --> 02:56:48,080
Oh, she's like actually animating the flower and stuff.

1622
02:56:50,080 --> 02:56:52,080
Hello.

1623
02:56:52,080 --> 02:56:55,080
Imagine counting flowers and someone just goes,

1624
02:56:55,080 --> 02:56:57,080
wow.

1625
02:56:59,080 --> 02:57:01,080
Oh my god, I think I would have a heart attack.

1626
02:57:06,080 --> 02:57:08,080
I would have enjoyed this.

1627
02:57:08,080 --> 02:57:10,080
Guards.

1628
02:57:10,080 --> 02:57:12,080
Jump on you and say hello.

1629
02:57:12,080 --> 02:57:14,080
That's what happens in the ASMR booth.

1630
02:57:14,080 --> 02:57:17,080
What happens in the booth stays in the booth.

1631
02:57:17,080 --> 02:57:20,080
I see that premium pass around your neck.

1632
02:57:20,080 --> 02:57:22,080
I'm jumping on you.

1633
02:57:22,080 --> 02:57:24,080
Thanks for supporting me.

1634
02:57:24,080 --> 02:57:26,080
I just have to wait for these guys to attack

1635
02:57:26,080 --> 02:57:28,080
because they are such a nightmare.

1636
02:57:28,080 --> 02:57:32,080
Literally, it's just so much faster to let them attack

1637
02:57:32,080 --> 02:57:34,080
and then...

1638
02:57:36,080 --> 02:57:38,080
Right.

1639
02:57:38,080 --> 02:57:40,080
Oh, I think I just net.

1640
02:57:42,080 --> 02:57:44,080
The jump scare.

1641
02:57:45,080 --> 02:57:47,080
Foxy jump scare.

1642
02:57:48,080 --> 02:57:50,080
Princesses from Kessels now.

1643
02:57:51,080 --> 02:57:53,080
Ora, ora, ora.

1644
02:57:53,080 --> 02:57:55,080
Right, so this is really awkward.

1645
02:57:55,080 --> 02:57:59,080
If Lucretia gets away, like back to that starting station,

1646
02:57:59,080 --> 02:58:01,080
she will spawn out of bounds

1647
02:58:01,080 --> 02:58:03,080
and there's absolutely nothing you can do about it

1648
02:58:03,080 --> 02:58:05,080
and you have to restart this section again.

1649
02:58:05,080 --> 02:58:07,080
It's so annoying.

1650
02:58:07,080 --> 02:58:11,080
Thankfully, the last few times I've played this game,

1651
02:58:11,080 --> 02:58:15,080
it's not happened, but when it does happen, it's so annoying.

1652
02:58:15,080 --> 02:58:18,080
Oh my god, it's so annoying, Lucretia.

1653
02:58:19,080 --> 02:58:21,080
If you can get...

1654
02:58:21,080 --> 02:58:23,080
Excuse me, I wasn't even putting her down

1655
02:58:23,080 --> 02:58:26,080
and you just whapped me with that frickin' weapon.

1656
02:58:26,080 --> 02:58:28,080
Stop it!

1657
02:58:28,080 --> 02:58:30,080
You're upsetting me!

1658
02:58:30,080 --> 02:58:32,080
Don't upset me!

1659
02:58:32,080 --> 02:58:34,080
Oh my god, please do not do a finishing move

1660
02:58:34,080 --> 02:58:37,080
if she gets away because I was busy doing a finishing move

1661
02:58:37,080 --> 02:58:39,080
to look really good.

1662
02:58:39,080 --> 02:58:42,080
The passing was, your hand was finished

1663
02:58:42,080 --> 02:58:45,080
and their memory's erased.

1664
02:58:45,080 --> 02:58:48,080
Oh no, the tombstone's erased.

1665
02:58:53,080 --> 02:58:55,080
See, she does that.

1666
02:58:55,080 --> 02:58:58,080
See, if she jumps out, you have to go grab her.

1667
02:58:58,080 --> 02:59:01,080
However, if the people are attacking you,

1668
02:59:01,080 --> 02:59:05,080
then she'll wait on the side patiently for you to kill them.

1669
02:59:05,080 --> 02:59:07,080
Oh my god, is she actually getting away?

1670
02:59:07,080 --> 02:59:09,080
I'm getting nervous.

1671
02:59:09,080 --> 02:59:12,080
Stop it, Lucretia!

1672
02:59:12,080 --> 02:59:15,080
Hen, Hen, calm down, let me just kidnap you.

1673
02:59:15,080 --> 02:59:18,080
I mean, come on, come on, let me just kidnap you, okay?

1674
02:59:18,080 --> 02:59:20,080
Let me just kidnap you.

1675
02:59:20,080 --> 02:59:22,080
Shhh!

1676
02:59:22,080 --> 02:59:24,080
You like it really, come on.

1677
02:59:24,080 --> 02:59:26,080
Your man's not gaining any attention

1678
02:59:26,080 --> 02:59:29,080
and look at me, I'm picking you up, I'm throwing you a boot.

1679
02:59:29,080 --> 02:59:31,080
This is exactly what you're wanting, Hen.

1680
02:59:31,080 --> 02:59:33,080
Lucretia, didn't you fight that?

1681
02:59:33,080 --> 02:59:35,080
Didn't you actually fight that?

1682
02:59:36,080 --> 02:59:42,080
Okay, shhh, that's right, that's right, just accept it.

1683
02:59:44,080 --> 02:59:47,080
Shhh, this is so weird, I'm sorry.

1684
02:59:50,080 --> 02:59:52,080
My words are wasted.

1685
02:59:52,080 --> 02:59:53,080
Hippocrita!

1686
02:59:53,080 --> 02:59:54,080
No!

1687
02:59:54,080 --> 02:59:56,080
No, come on.

1688
02:59:57,080 --> 02:59:59,080
Okay, we did it.

1689
03:00:00,080 --> 03:00:02,080
Hippocrita!

1690
03:00:03,080 --> 03:00:05,080
Just kidnap me, Strony.

1691
03:00:10,080 --> 03:00:12,080
Crank sale, those are some big words.

1692
03:00:12,080 --> 03:00:14,080
You're not supposed to say that stuff.

1693
03:00:14,080 --> 03:00:16,080
Pip sweat detected.

1694
03:00:17,080 --> 03:00:20,080
Strony be taking tips from Mercy.

1695
03:00:20,080 --> 03:00:22,080
That's enough out of you.

1696
03:00:26,080 --> 03:00:28,080
He's smart, I can't read him.

1697
03:00:29,080 --> 03:00:31,080
Okay.

1698
03:00:32,080 --> 03:00:33,080
Do not be detected.

1699
03:00:33,080 --> 03:00:35,080
Again, another do not be detected.

1700
03:00:35,080 --> 03:00:37,080
But there's two guards literally dead ahead.

1701
03:00:37,080 --> 03:00:39,080
How am I not to be detected by them

1702
03:00:39,080 --> 03:00:41,080
when we play this for people?

1703
03:00:41,080 --> 03:00:43,080
Did they come in here?

1704
03:00:43,080 --> 03:00:45,080
No, this cannot be.

1705
03:00:45,080 --> 03:00:47,080
Did they actually come in here?

1706
03:00:49,080 --> 03:00:52,080
Okay, one gets his...

1707
03:00:55,080 --> 03:00:57,080
No, okay.

1708
03:00:58,080 --> 03:01:00,080
How am I supposed to deal with two of them at once

1709
03:01:00,080 --> 03:01:02,080
when we do it for real?

1710
03:01:04,080 --> 03:01:06,080
Eh, you better calm down, hen.

1711
03:01:06,080 --> 03:01:08,080
I'm rescuing you, Christina.

1712
03:01:08,080 --> 03:01:10,080
Then you get on at me about taking so long.

1713
03:01:10,080 --> 03:01:12,080
What are you doing?

1714
03:01:13,080 --> 03:01:15,080
Catarina.

1715
03:01:16,080 --> 03:01:18,080
I can't wait to hear your ASMR streams.

1716
03:01:18,080 --> 03:01:21,080
Oh, it's just absolute word vomit, I promise you.

1717
03:01:21,080 --> 03:01:23,080
Absolutely nothing makes sense.

1718
03:01:23,080 --> 03:01:25,080
My accent gets a little off the wee bit when I whisper,

1719
03:01:25,080 --> 03:01:27,080
but it's not really a big deal.

1720
03:01:27,080 --> 03:01:29,080
Like, I can make it...

1721
03:01:29,080 --> 03:01:31,080
I can enhance.

1722
03:01:34,080 --> 03:01:36,080
All about that?

1723
03:01:37,080 --> 03:01:38,080
Yes, yes, yes.

1724
03:01:38,080 --> 03:01:39,080
I know.

1725
03:01:39,080 --> 03:01:41,080
You gave me your hole, so I'd protect you.

1726
03:01:41,080 --> 03:01:42,080
It's... oh.

1727
03:01:42,080 --> 03:01:43,080
Hello.

1728
03:01:43,080 --> 03:01:44,080
Bye-bye.

1729
03:01:44,080 --> 03:01:45,080
Hello.

1730
03:01:45,080 --> 03:01:47,080
Bye-bye.

1731
03:01:48,080 --> 03:01:51,080
I do be a really skilled assassin, honestly.

1732
03:01:51,080 --> 03:01:53,080
Ready?

1733
03:01:57,080 --> 03:01:59,080
Where?

1734
03:02:02,080 --> 03:02:04,080
He's just like me for real, for real.

1735
03:02:04,080 --> 03:02:06,080
He literally went...

1736
03:02:08,080 --> 03:02:10,080
Where actually is the auditorium?

1737
03:02:10,080 --> 03:02:12,080
Confirmed.

1738
03:02:13,080 --> 03:02:15,080
Never do that to me again.

1739
03:02:16,080 --> 03:02:19,080
Man, they didn't even let her put on her dress and stuff.

1740
03:02:19,080 --> 03:02:21,080
It's all torn at the bottom.

1741
03:02:21,080 --> 03:02:23,080
Oh, also, you can walk on barrels.

1742
03:02:23,080 --> 03:02:25,080
If you wanted to know that,

1743
03:02:25,080 --> 03:02:28,080
you can like jump up on barrels while carrying people.

1744
03:02:30,080 --> 03:02:33,080
It's just like a silly little goofy thing, but I like it.

1745
03:02:34,080 --> 03:02:35,080
Okay.

1746
03:02:35,080 --> 03:02:37,080
We pop you down there, pet the eagle,

1747
03:02:37,080 --> 03:02:39,080
and then we just give a wee stabby stabby the eagle,

1748
03:02:39,080 --> 03:02:41,080
all for you, mate.

1749
03:02:41,080 --> 03:02:44,080
And we just pick up the lady again.

1750
03:02:44,080 --> 03:02:46,080
And then basically...

1751
03:02:46,080 --> 03:02:48,080
If you pop her down in the middle,

1752
03:02:48,080 --> 03:02:52,080
I think you can access both gates without losing distance.

1753
03:02:52,080 --> 03:02:56,080
It will warn you against distance if you get too far away from her,

1754
03:02:56,080 --> 03:02:58,080
but...

1755
03:03:00,080 --> 03:03:03,080
No, I was gonna walk away.

1756
03:03:03,080 --> 03:03:06,080
I was gonna walk away and you forfeited your life.

1757
03:03:07,080 --> 03:03:10,080
How could you be such a silly...

1758
03:03:10,080 --> 03:03:13,080
I think we actually might have to move her over.

1759
03:03:13,080 --> 03:03:16,080
Whoa, did you guys see what I just saw?

1760
03:03:17,080 --> 03:03:18,080
Oh, leave me alone.

1761
03:03:18,080 --> 03:03:19,080
No, no, you don't see me.

1762
03:03:19,080 --> 03:03:20,080
I'm just going up the stairs.

1763
03:03:20,080 --> 03:03:21,080
I'm just a tourist.

1764
03:03:21,080 --> 03:03:22,080
I'm a visor, okay?

1765
03:03:22,080 --> 03:03:24,080
I'm a visor of the...

1766
03:03:25,080 --> 03:03:27,080
I thought I was gonna desync there.

1767
03:03:27,080 --> 03:03:28,080
I got scared.

1768
03:03:28,080 --> 03:03:30,080
I thought I was gonna desync there.

1769
03:03:31,080 --> 03:03:34,080
I saw her panties.

1770
03:03:34,080 --> 03:03:35,080
Shhh.

1771
03:03:35,080 --> 03:03:38,080
And I didn't even have to pay anything.

1772
03:03:38,080 --> 03:03:40,080
I saw them for free.

1773
03:03:40,080 --> 03:03:42,080
Shhh.

1774
03:03:42,080 --> 03:03:44,080
Wait, can that guy see me again?

1775
03:03:44,080 --> 03:03:45,080
Oh!

1776
03:03:45,080 --> 03:03:48,080
I think we're gonna have to do the old ear assassination.

1777
03:03:51,080 --> 03:03:52,080
Excuse me, sir.

1778
03:03:52,080 --> 03:03:54,080
I just moved over to do an ear assassination.

1779
03:03:54,080 --> 03:03:55,080
Thank you.

1780
03:03:58,080 --> 03:04:00,080
The audio is strange again.

1781
03:04:00,080 --> 03:04:02,080
It better not be.

1782
03:04:05,080 --> 03:04:07,080
Why?

1783
03:04:07,080 --> 03:04:08,080
Why?

1784
03:04:08,080 --> 03:04:11,080
Literally nothing has changed.

1785
03:04:13,080 --> 03:04:15,080
I'm gonna tab in and out of the game multiple times.

1786
03:04:15,080 --> 03:04:18,080
Okay, so it's gonna pause and then open back up

1787
03:04:18,080 --> 03:04:21,080
and pause and open back up.

1788
03:04:25,080 --> 03:04:27,080
There's a static noise.

1789
03:04:27,080 --> 03:04:29,080
Sound like a static review.

1790
03:04:30,080 --> 03:04:32,080
If I have to close the game again,

1791
03:04:32,080 --> 03:04:34,080
I will.

1792
03:04:36,080 --> 03:04:38,080
A desync warning.

1793
03:04:38,080 --> 03:04:41,080
Like, it sounds perfectly fine for me.

1794
03:04:42,080 --> 03:04:44,080
Still there?

1795
03:04:45,080 --> 03:04:46,080
Shhh.

1796
03:04:51,080 --> 03:04:54,080
Do I have to play this whole section again if I quit right now?

1797
03:04:54,080 --> 03:04:56,080
It's still buzzing.

1798
03:04:56,080 --> 03:04:58,080
Do you know what buzzing means in Scots?

1799
03:04:58,080 --> 03:05:00,080
It means you're really having to play it now.

1800
03:05:01,080 --> 03:05:04,080
A feature where I know you can just restart the audio capture?

1801
03:05:04,080 --> 03:05:06,080
I mean, wait.

1802
03:05:06,080 --> 03:05:09,080
Hold on, controversial move, I know.

1803
03:05:11,080 --> 03:05:13,080
How does that sound?

1804
03:05:14,080 --> 03:05:16,080
Does that sound normal?

1805
03:05:18,080 --> 03:05:22,080
I am now capturing my desktop audio instead of the game.

1806
03:05:23,080 --> 03:05:26,080
Okay, I can now, you're literally gonna hear

1807
03:05:26,080 --> 03:05:30,080
if one of the girls DM me on Discord, that's the only thing.

1808
03:05:32,080 --> 03:05:34,080
Okay, let's get across the bridge.

1809
03:05:34,080 --> 03:05:36,080
Risky, I know you're all gonna know that.

1810
03:05:36,080 --> 03:05:40,080
I've arranged another ASMR collab.

1811
03:05:40,080 --> 03:05:44,080
Like, literally 30 minutes before the stream started.

1812
03:05:44,080 --> 03:05:47,080
I burst into someone's DMs on Twitter.

1813
03:05:47,080 --> 03:05:50,080
And I was like, hey girl, do you wanna add me?

1814
03:05:50,080 --> 03:05:53,080
And then I was talking through my ASMR collab.

1815
03:05:53,080 --> 03:05:55,080
And I've already planned it.

1816
03:05:55,080 --> 03:05:59,080
It's not a big ASMR, it goes on her channel and all that jazz, but yeah.

1817
03:06:00,080 --> 03:06:03,080
Okay, we have a timer, we basically just have to survive.

1818
03:06:03,080 --> 03:06:07,080
So this is where you can get the serial killer achievement again,

1819
03:06:07,080 --> 03:06:09,080
but it gets a bit iffy.

1820
03:06:10,080 --> 03:06:13,080
It's not the best, I will mess up.

1821
03:06:13,080 --> 03:06:18,080
And where the enemies go away, citizen, I don't wanna kill anymore.

1822
03:06:20,080 --> 03:06:22,080
I'm gonna try and kill the wee guys first,

1823
03:06:22,080 --> 03:06:26,080
because they grab me like that and ruin my streak.

1824
03:06:29,080 --> 03:06:31,080
Okay, sorry, I'm focusing.

1825
03:06:31,080 --> 03:06:34,080
See when they grab you, it takes you out of your kill streak advantage.

1826
03:06:34,080 --> 03:06:36,080
And there's Lancers as well, I can see that Lancer.

1827
03:06:36,080 --> 03:06:38,080
I'm gonna try and take him out in the kill streak.

1828
03:06:39,080 --> 03:06:40,080
Okay.

1829
03:06:41,080 --> 03:06:44,080
I'm trying to get the Lancer and it keeps all into the other guys.

1830
03:06:46,080 --> 03:06:47,080
Come on.

1831
03:06:47,080 --> 03:06:48,080
Wee guy next.

1832
03:06:49,080 --> 03:06:51,080
Armor guy next, I guess.

1833
03:06:51,080 --> 03:06:54,080
He's probably the best, but okay, I can't break his armor.

1834
03:06:54,080 --> 03:06:56,080
So I'm just gonna go for the wee guy.

1835
03:06:57,080 --> 03:06:58,080
Okay.

1836
03:06:59,080 --> 03:07:01,080
We're getting there, we're getting there, 30 more seconds.

1837
03:07:01,080 --> 03:07:03,080
Do not grab me.

1838
03:07:03,080 --> 03:07:04,080
I hate when they grab me.

1839
03:07:04,080 --> 03:07:06,080
Oh no, no, no, not the horse.

1840
03:07:06,080 --> 03:07:08,080
Not the horse, not the horse.

1841
03:07:10,080 --> 03:07:12,080
I said I'm hiding from the horse, get me in the hay bale.

1842
03:07:14,080 --> 03:07:16,080
I'm scared of the horses.

1843
03:07:16,080 --> 03:07:18,080
I actually don't know how to take down horse guys.

1844
03:07:20,080 --> 03:07:21,080
Ouch.

1845
03:07:21,080 --> 03:07:23,080
Yeah, this is why I don't like the horse guy.

1846
03:07:23,080 --> 03:07:26,080
We got seven seconds, we just need to not get hit.

1847
03:07:26,080 --> 03:07:29,080
Because we can run away in two seconds.

1848
03:07:29,080 --> 03:07:32,080
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

1849
03:07:33,080 --> 03:07:34,080
Wee.

1850
03:07:37,080 --> 03:07:38,080
Oh my god.

1851
03:07:39,080 --> 03:07:44,080
Okay, so in this sequence, you just need to get out a range of the yellow on the map.

1852
03:07:44,080 --> 03:07:50,080
If you come on the roof, you can basically run along it as much as you need.

1853
03:07:50,080 --> 03:07:57,080
Or if you don't like rooftop scaling, there is boats down to the left where you can get out a range.

1854
03:07:58,080 --> 03:07:59,080
Down, down, down.

1855
03:08:01,080 --> 03:08:03,080
Bruh, bruh, get off.

1856
03:08:04,080 --> 03:08:05,080
My roof, no.

1857
03:08:06,080 --> 03:08:12,080
And then if we disappear in the water maybe, I think we can hide in the water.

1858
03:08:13,080 --> 03:08:15,080
You can like literally hide in the water.

1859
03:08:16,080 --> 03:08:18,080
I'm a call fish, let's go.

1860
03:08:19,080 --> 03:08:20,080
Can they see me?

1861
03:08:21,080 --> 03:08:27,080
Physically, yes they can see me, but game development wise?

1862
03:08:27,080 --> 03:08:30,080
No, they can't, so I enjoyed that.

1863
03:08:30,080 --> 03:08:32,080
Do that again, more game please.

1864
03:08:33,080 --> 03:08:35,080
Okay, we're gonna kill this guy.

1865
03:08:35,080 --> 03:08:38,080
Sorry, I'm sorry mate, your time is up.

1866
03:08:39,080 --> 03:08:40,080
Oh, I forget.

1867
03:08:41,080 --> 03:08:44,080
Okay, if you scare away, you won't be able to...

1868
03:08:44,080 --> 03:08:48,080
Right, we're gonna go for this poster just because I don't want guards to attack you on site.

1869
03:08:49,080 --> 03:08:52,080
If you are the highest notoriety, they will attack you.

1870
03:08:53,080 --> 03:08:57,080
Oh, the poster is down here, I have been fooled.

1871
03:08:57,080 --> 03:08:59,080
The egg is on my face.

1872
03:09:02,080 --> 03:09:11,080
We need to now go back to the island hideout because Caterina's forces are there.

1873
03:09:12,080 --> 03:09:20,080
And then we can unlock assassin recruits and then we're really gonna get into the meat of the game and I love it.

1874
03:09:20,080 --> 03:09:23,080
And everything is so cool, everything's so awesome.

1875
03:09:25,080 --> 03:09:28,080
We're just gonna, alright, here we go, yank.

1876
03:09:28,080 --> 03:09:31,080
He said enough, I yanked him off for heart, enough.

1877
03:09:32,080 --> 03:09:33,080
Enough.

1878
03:09:34,080 --> 03:09:35,080
Is it enough?

1879
03:09:36,080 --> 03:09:38,080
Don't you not want to give more?

1880
03:09:42,080 --> 03:09:45,080
Okay, this is the only problem when navigating with a horse.

1881
03:09:45,080 --> 03:09:51,080
You have to, you're like stuck to using whatever roads you've passed out and it gets really...

1882
03:10:04,080 --> 03:10:07,080
Why would you bother just going down to it, folks?

1883
03:10:08,080 --> 03:10:10,080
If you come on the roof, should you...

1884
03:10:12,080 --> 03:10:15,080
I never even said that, that was you that said that.

1885
03:10:15,080 --> 03:10:18,080
Normally I'm the one coming out with the outrageous...

1886
03:10:19,080 --> 03:10:22,080
I just whistled for the horse whilst purchasing the bank.

1887
03:10:25,080 --> 03:10:27,080
Hey, horse, can you come out here?

1888
03:10:27,080 --> 03:10:29,080
Thanks, appreciate it.

1889
03:10:29,080 --> 03:10:30,080
Like, oh, okay.

1890
03:10:34,080 --> 03:10:38,080
Oh, we made 1.5 Florence.

1891
03:10:38,080 --> 03:10:40,080
That's pretty good.

1892
03:10:40,080 --> 03:10:44,080
I don't think we're gonna get the crossbow before the section that I'm hoping to get it by.

1893
03:10:45,080 --> 03:10:47,080
I don't know why we lost all our money.

1894
03:10:47,080 --> 03:10:48,080
Don't know how it happened.

1895
03:10:48,080 --> 03:10:50,080
Something, something don't gamble at home, people.

1896
03:10:52,080 --> 03:10:54,080
But may have lost all our money in that.

1897
03:10:55,080 --> 03:10:57,080
Right, where is the bridge?

1898
03:10:57,080 --> 03:10:59,080
The bridge is over here, okay.

1899
03:11:01,080 --> 03:11:03,080
Gotta stay on them peasants.

1900
03:11:04,080 --> 03:11:07,080
Horse is the first customer of the store, for real, for real.

1901
03:11:07,080 --> 03:11:09,080
Munching on that hay.

1902
03:11:13,080 --> 03:11:15,080
Okay, we have made it to the island.

1903
03:11:17,080 --> 03:11:20,080
Never gamble with your own money, gamble with someone else's, that's terrible.

1904
03:11:20,080 --> 03:11:22,080
Don't gamble at all.

1905
03:11:23,080 --> 03:11:24,080
Save that mule.

1906
03:11:25,080 --> 03:11:26,080
I could not find him.

1907
03:11:27,080 --> 03:11:29,080
Get yourself a wee fizzy juice from the corner shop.

1908
03:11:29,080 --> 03:11:31,080
Maybe a wee bakery, a wee scone.

1909
03:11:31,080 --> 03:11:33,080
To treat those things.

1910
03:11:35,080 --> 03:11:37,080
The bank is in the room.

1911
03:11:39,080 --> 03:11:40,080
Okay.

1912
03:11:44,080 --> 03:11:45,080
Wow.

1913
03:11:46,080 --> 03:11:48,080
It's normally outcast.

1914
03:11:49,080 --> 03:11:50,080
Very odd indeed.

1915
03:11:51,080 --> 03:11:52,080
What a waste.

1916
03:11:52,080 --> 03:11:58,080
So the Volpe thinks that Marquee Valley tipped off Cesare to leave the castle.

1917
03:11:59,080 --> 03:12:01,080
So we're all suspicious.

1918
03:12:03,080 --> 03:12:05,080
Cesare commands a massive army in Romania.

1919
03:12:06,080 --> 03:12:07,080
You would never reach it.

1920
03:12:08,080 --> 03:12:09,080
I say we work here.

1921
03:12:09,080 --> 03:12:10,080
Loma.

1922
03:12:10,080 --> 03:12:13,080
They rode the Borja's influence while restoring our own.

1923
03:12:14,080 --> 03:12:15,080
And in fact,

1924
03:12:15,080 --> 03:12:17,080
I'm gonna start right now.

1925
03:12:17,080 --> 03:12:18,080
Yes.

1926
03:12:18,080 --> 03:12:19,080
We're doing it.

1927
03:12:26,080 --> 03:12:27,080
We're doing it.

1928
03:12:27,080 --> 03:12:28,080
We're about to get the brotherhood.

1929
03:12:28,080 --> 03:12:29,080
Come on, reflings.

1930
03:12:29,080 --> 03:12:31,080
I want to turn you guys into assassins.

1931
03:12:32,080 --> 03:12:34,080
I want to turn you to deadly weapons.

1932
03:12:35,080 --> 03:12:38,080
The Borja robbed everything from the people to maintain power.

1933
03:12:39,080 --> 03:12:40,080
What do you intend to do?

1934
03:12:41,080 --> 03:12:43,080
You will recruit him to our cause.

1935
03:12:43,080 --> 03:12:44,080
You cannot be serious.

1936
03:12:44,080 --> 03:12:46,080
To win this war, Marquee Valley.

1937
03:12:46,080 --> 03:12:47,080
We need loyal soldiers.

1938
03:12:47,080 --> 03:12:48,080
Come on, reflings.

1939
03:12:49,080 --> 03:12:50,080
You'd let me draft you, right?

1940
03:12:52,080 --> 03:12:54,080
All right, let's get drafted.

1941
03:12:56,080 --> 03:12:58,080
I'm gonna be the combat medic on the battlefield.

1942
03:12:58,080 --> 03:13:00,080
Okay, I'm healing you guys on the battlefield.

1943
03:13:01,080 --> 03:13:02,080
With my...

1944
03:13:03,080 --> 03:13:05,080
Oh, my God.

1945
03:13:05,080 --> 03:13:07,080
The cutscene took so long that...

1946
03:13:07,080 --> 03:13:08,080
Wait!

1947
03:13:09,080 --> 03:13:11,080
Whoa, I've never seen this happen before.

1948
03:13:11,080 --> 03:13:14,080
To recruit spawned and the cutscene took so long,

1949
03:13:14,080 --> 03:13:16,080
they both died in the instants.

1950
03:13:16,080 --> 03:13:18,080
Oh, my God.

1951
03:13:18,080 --> 03:13:20,080
All right, she's still alive.

1952
03:13:20,080 --> 03:13:21,080
Let's save her.

1953
03:13:21,080 --> 03:13:22,080
Oh, my God.

1954
03:13:22,080 --> 03:13:23,080
It's Shrek and...

1955
03:13:23,080 --> 03:13:26,080
No, no, no, no, we've just attracted more guards.

1956
03:13:26,080 --> 03:13:27,080
This is terrible.

1957
03:13:27,080 --> 03:13:29,080
She has incredibly low health.

1958
03:13:30,080 --> 03:13:31,080
Oh, goodness me.

1959
03:13:31,080 --> 03:13:33,080
Oh, goodness gravy.

1960
03:13:34,080 --> 03:13:35,080
Please don't perish.

1961
03:13:35,080 --> 03:13:36,080
I hope she doesn't perish,

1962
03:13:36,080 --> 03:13:37,080
cause we're actually gonna have to...

1963
03:13:37,080 --> 03:13:39,080
Okay, she didn't perish, thank goodness.

1964
03:13:40,080 --> 03:13:41,080
Already sold my life.

1965
03:13:41,080 --> 03:13:42,080
One!

1966
03:13:42,080 --> 03:13:44,080
What did you sell your life to?

1967
03:13:46,080 --> 03:13:47,080
Sin?

1968
03:13:49,080 --> 03:13:51,080
It's a lady assassin.

1969
03:13:51,080 --> 03:13:54,080
You'll never guess what I do to the lady assassin.

1970
03:13:54,080 --> 03:13:55,080
Okay, I'm gonna open up the map

1971
03:13:55,080 --> 03:13:57,080
and the map will tell us where the next recruit is.

1972
03:13:57,080 --> 03:13:59,080
So we can go recruit this person.

1973
03:14:01,080 --> 03:14:06,080
And now we are about to unlock assassin recruit signals,

1974
03:14:06,080 --> 03:14:08,080
which means in the middle of a fight

1975
03:14:08,080 --> 03:14:11,080
we can literally ask the game to help us.

1976
03:14:11,080 --> 03:14:13,080
And there's also a really fun minigame

1977
03:14:13,080 --> 03:14:15,080
where you can level them up

1978
03:14:15,080 --> 03:14:17,080
and make them even stronger to the point

1979
03:14:17,080 --> 03:14:20,080
where they can fight incredibly strong enemies.

1980
03:14:20,080 --> 03:14:24,080
And it is so satisfying watching their health bars go up.

1981
03:14:24,080 --> 03:14:26,080
Oh, look, I have it already, actually.

1982
03:14:26,080 --> 03:14:30,080
I'm gonna use it for this citizen.

1983
03:14:30,080 --> 03:14:33,080
If I can get to them in time before they perish.

1984
03:14:36,080 --> 03:14:37,080
Here we go.

1985
03:14:37,080 --> 03:14:38,080
Oh, it's another lady.

1986
03:14:38,080 --> 03:14:42,080
Oh my God, we're like doing all ladies in this assassin group.

1987
03:14:42,080 --> 03:14:44,080
Oops, my bad.

1988
03:14:44,080 --> 03:14:46,080
You can't really...

1989
03:14:46,080 --> 03:14:48,080
Oh, okay.

1990
03:14:48,080 --> 03:14:49,080
Hold on, let me go.

1991
03:14:49,080 --> 03:14:50,080
Let me get up.

1992
03:14:50,080 --> 03:14:51,080
Okay, we're...

1993
03:14:51,080 --> 03:14:52,080
Oh my gosh.

1994
03:14:52,080 --> 03:14:54,080
Assassin's Creed Brotherhood.

1995
03:14:54,080 --> 03:14:56,080
More like the sisterhood.

1996
03:14:56,080 --> 03:14:57,080
Am I right?

1997
03:14:57,080 --> 03:14:58,080
Ha ha.

1998
03:15:01,080 --> 03:15:03,080
Hopefully we can get a few guys in here.

1999
03:15:03,080 --> 03:15:04,080
We need to repopulate Roma.

2000
03:15:04,080 --> 03:15:05,080
You know what I'm saying?

2001
03:15:05,080 --> 03:15:06,080
Yum yum yum yum.

2002
03:15:07,080 --> 03:15:09,080
Let's unlock the doctors

2003
03:15:09,080 --> 03:15:11,080
because we can get more money in general.

2004
03:15:12,080 --> 03:15:14,080
Strong door calls for aid.

2005
03:15:15,080 --> 03:15:17,080
Me on Christmas like.

2006
03:15:18,080 --> 03:15:19,080
Okay.

2007
03:15:20,080 --> 03:15:21,080
So...

2008
03:15:21,080 --> 03:15:22,080
Lead...

2009
03:15:22,080 --> 03:15:24,080
What did he say?

2010
03:15:25,080 --> 03:15:27,080
I don't think I've ever heard that.

2011
03:15:27,080 --> 03:15:30,080
I've got a new lead based cure for syphilis.

2012
03:15:30,080 --> 03:15:33,080
I didn't know that was in the game.

2013
03:15:33,080 --> 03:15:35,080
That's outrageous.

2014
03:15:35,080 --> 03:15:39,080
Right, we're gonna go pick up this other assassin recruit

2015
03:15:39,080 --> 03:15:41,080
because they're like 100 meters away.

2016
03:15:41,080 --> 03:15:44,080
That's absolutely hilarious.

2017
03:15:44,080 --> 03:15:49,080
And we're also gonna send one of our assassin recruits away on a mission

2018
03:15:49,080 --> 03:15:52,080
which is how you level up the assassins

2019
03:15:52,080 --> 03:15:55,080
and you get a stupendous amount of money for it.

2020
03:15:57,080 --> 03:16:01,080
So I get 650 florins for 6 minutes I send this person away for.

2021
03:16:01,080 --> 03:16:03,080
So this is your biggest money maker

2022
03:16:03,080 --> 03:16:05,080
sending your assassin recruits away.

2023
03:16:06,080 --> 03:16:08,080
So we might be able to get the crossbow ball

2024
03:16:08,080 --> 03:16:11,080
if I dilly dally and do a few save quest things.

2025
03:16:11,080 --> 03:16:13,080
Or we can just rush through.

2026
03:16:13,080 --> 03:16:15,080
It's not really rushing because

2027
03:16:15,080 --> 03:16:18,080
it's just playing the campaign but yeah.

2028
03:16:19,080 --> 03:16:21,080
I'll have to say nothing is true.

2029
03:16:21,080 --> 03:16:24,080
Everything is permitted for real.

2030
03:16:24,080 --> 03:16:28,080
I'm training my reeflings to become weapons of destruction.

2031
03:16:28,080 --> 03:16:30,080
Where's the citizen?

2032
03:16:30,080 --> 03:16:32,080
Oh, they're already fighting.

2033
03:16:32,080 --> 03:16:35,080
Oh, the citizen might die.

2034
03:16:37,080 --> 03:16:40,080
Oh, why is this building so tall?

2035
03:16:40,080 --> 03:16:42,080
Oh, can I get them?

2036
03:16:42,080 --> 03:16:43,080
Can I save you?

2037
03:16:43,080 --> 03:16:45,080
I'm coming, I'm coming.

2038
03:16:45,080 --> 03:16:47,080
I'm helping, I'm helping.

2039
03:16:47,080 --> 03:16:49,080
Okay, we got it, we got it, we got it.

2040
03:16:49,080 --> 03:16:50,080
Okay, good.

2041
03:16:50,080 --> 03:16:52,080
Oh no, there's more guards that have come in.

2042
03:16:52,080 --> 03:16:54,080
Oh, I don't know how low his HP is.

2043
03:16:54,080 --> 03:16:58,080
The recruits are so bad at the game as well.

2044
03:16:58,080 --> 03:17:00,080
Oh, I'm so bad at the game.

2045
03:17:00,080 --> 03:17:03,080
Oh, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on.

2046
03:17:03,080 --> 03:17:05,080
Oh, come on, you can do it.

2047
03:17:05,080 --> 03:17:06,080
Okay.

2048
03:17:07,080 --> 03:17:08,080
Oh, we did it.

2049
03:17:08,080 --> 03:17:10,080
I instantly you want to pick up the recruit

2050
03:17:10,080 --> 03:17:13,080
because it gets rid of any guards that are nearby.

2051
03:17:14,080 --> 03:17:16,080
Mere gracia, Amiko.

2052
03:17:20,080 --> 03:17:22,080
Weapons of destruction.

2053
03:17:22,080 --> 03:17:25,080
Achievements, brotherhood.

2054
03:17:27,080 --> 03:17:31,080
If we had gamer score, we'd probably have like 200 venerals.

2055
03:17:31,080 --> 03:17:33,080
Oh, these are the Borja zones that we've liberated.

2056
03:17:33,080 --> 03:17:37,080
We've done three places, so we're allowed to have three recruits.

2057
03:17:37,080 --> 03:17:42,080
We've done four places, excuse me, so we're allowed to have four recruits.

2058
03:17:42,080 --> 03:17:44,080
I literally just remembered.

2059
03:17:45,080 --> 03:17:50,080
We can go to the main quest, which is down here.

2060
03:17:50,080 --> 03:17:53,080
There's actually someone we can recruit over here.

2061
03:17:54,080 --> 03:17:57,080
Nah, we'll go to the main quest and we'll pick up recruits on the way.

2062
03:17:57,080 --> 03:17:58,080
We've got a fill bar of recruits.

2063
03:17:58,080 --> 03:18:01,080
Unfortunately, they're very weak, so it's not very good.

2064
03:18:01,080 --> 03:18:03,080
I'm chasing after you, my recruit.

2065
03:18:05,080 --> 03:18:09,080
It's not very good to send them to battle

2066
03:18:09,080 --> 03:18:11,080
without kind of leveling them up first

2067
03:18:11,080 --> 03:18:15,080
because your recruits can perish in a fight, unironically.

2068
03:18:17,080 --> 03:18:21,080
Yeah, your assassins can die, it's very dangerous.

2069
03:18:25,080 --> 03:18:27,080
Across the bridges are our first mission.

2070
03:18:27,080 --> 03:18:31,080
These missions are all based around calling your assassin recruits in,

2071
03:18:31,080 --> 03:18:35,080
but the bar does take exactly 60 seconds to refresh

2072
03:18:35,080 --> 03:18:38,080
from when they disappear, not from when you call them in,

2073
03:18:38,080 --> 03:18:40,080
from when they disappear off the map.

2074
03:18:41,080 --> 03:18:46,080
And some of the missions, they take a hot second.

2075
03:18:46,080 --> 03:18:49,080
It's good to get multiple bars of assassin recruits,

2076
03:18:49,080 --> 03:18:52,080
so the more Borgia towers you destroy, the more recruits you're allowed,

2077
03:18:52,080 --> 03:19:00,080
and you've got a maximum of three bars, so six Borgia towers.

2078
03:19:00,080 --> 03:19:02,080
Where the heck am I going?

2079
03:19:02,080 --> 03:19:04,080
Oh, this one, I remember.

2080
03:19:04,080 --> 03:19:08,080
Hello, sorry to swing in about that over this very sad scene.

2081
03:19:09,080 --> 03:19:10,080
Mafato!

2082
03:19:10,080 --> 03:19:13,080
This is another multiplayer character that we kill.

2083
03:19:13,080 --> 03:19:18,080
We must follow the whores,

2084
03:19:18,080 --> 03:19:21,080
so they will point to where we need to go,

2085
03:19:21,080 --> 03:19:24,080
but I have played this game many a time now,

2086
03:19:24,080 --> 03:19:27,080
so you can just keep running in general.

2087
03:19:27,080 --> 03:19:32,080
Running, running, running, running, running, running, running, running, running.

2088
03:19:32,080 --> 03:19:35,080
Yeah, we do have our recruits ready to assassinate this guy,

2089
03:19:35,080 --> 03:19:39,080
and we should get a tidy sum of money for doing so.

2090
03:19:43,080 --> 03:19:45,080
I've actually never tried to break this sequence

2091
03:19:45,080 --> 03:19:48,080
and go outside of what the girls point you to.

2092
03:19:52,080 --> 03:19:54,080
I've called my recruit.

2093
03:19:54,080 --> 03:19:55,080
I don't know where she is.

2094
03:19:55,080 --> 03:19:56,080
She's taking her sweet time, right?

2095
03:19:56,080 --> 03:19:57,080
There you go.

2096
03:19:57,080 --> 03:19:58,080
Get him!

2097
03:19:59,080 --> 03:20:01,080
And then with 100% of that,

2098
03:20:01,080 --> 03:20:02,080
I'm going to shower.

2099
03:20:02,080 --> 03:20:04,080
Hold on, let me pause the stream for you.

2100
03:20:05,080 --> 03:20:06,080
I'm teasing.

2101
03:20:06,080 --> 03:20:07,080
Enjoy your shower.

2102
03:20:07,080 --> 03:20:09,080
Don't forget to do your belly button and behind your ears.

2103
03:20:09,080 --> 03:20:11,080
A lot of people forget.

2104
03:20:11,080 --> 03:20:13,080
And make sure you soap all over,

2105
03:20:13,080 --> 03:20:15,080
even on your booty hole.

2106
03:20:15,080 --> 03:20:18,080
Soap cleans itself due to the nature of it.

2107
03:20:21,080 --> 03:20:24,080
Not that you're expecting a visitor anytime soon, are you?

2108
03:20:29,080 --> 03:20:30,080
Do you get a lot of money if you loot?

2109
03:20:30,080 --> 03:20:33,080
No, you don't get anything if you loot the multiplayer.

2110
03:20:33,080 --> 03:20:35,080
Ooh, new recruit, let's get it.

2111
03:20:39,080 --> 03:20:40,080
No, they're fighting.

2112
03:20:40,080 --> 03:20:42,080
Stop fighting before I even get there.

2113
03:20:42,080 --> 03:20:43,080
My goodness.

2114
03:20:43,080 --> 03:20:44,080
Stop it!

2115
03:20:44,080 --> 03:20:45,080
Stop it!

2116
03:20:46,080 --> 03:20:47,080
I'm coming to hell.

2117
03:20:47,080 --> 03:20:48,080
Give me a second.

2118
03:20:48,080 --> 03:20:49,080
Let me cook.

2119
03:20:49,080 --> 03:20:50,080
Oh, my God.

2120
03:20:50,080 --> 03:20:52,080
I've just invited even more guards to come over.

2121
03:20:53,080 --> 03:20:54,080
Oh, please don't.

2122
03:20:54,080 --> 03:20:56,080
I don't know how damaged they is.

2123
03:20:56,080 --> 03:20:58,080
Please don't do a cutscene.

2124
03:20:59,080 --> 03:21:02,080
There's too many enemies around right now for this.

2125
03:21:04,080 --> 03:21:05,080
Oh, oops.

2126
03:21:06,080 --> 03:21:08,080
I am actually going to pick up these bodies

2127
03:21:08,080 --> 03:21:10,080
and put them in the hay bale

2128
03:21:10,080 --> 03:21:12,080
because if you put five in a hay bale,

2129
03:21:12,080 --> 03:21:14,080
you do a cortisol challenge.

2130
03:21:14,080 --> 03:21:15,080
I'm just going to do this now,

2131
03:21:15,080 --> 03:21:16,080
so I'm not going to talk to them.

2132
03:21:16,080 --> 03:21:18,080
I'm literally going to save his life

2133
03:21:18,080 --> 03:21:19,080
and then just be like, excuse me,

2134
03:21:19,080 --> 03:21:20,080
I'm just trying to hide the evidence

2135
03:21:20,080 --> 03:21:22,080
of what we've just committed together.

2136
03:21:29,080 --> 03:21:30,080
Mother Mary.

2137
03:21:30,080 --> 03:21:32,080
No, not the sword.

2138
03:21:32,080 --> 03:21:33,080
The body.

2139
03:21:33,080 --> 03:21:34,080
No, the body.

2140
03:21:34,080 --> 03:21:35,080
Thank you.

2141
03:21:36,080 --> 03:21:38,080
No requiesce de parti.

2142
03:21:41,080 --> 03:21:43,080
One more body should do it.

2143
03:21:43,080 --> 03:21:45,080
No, not the weapon.

2144
03:21:45,080 --> 03:21:46,080
The body.

2145
03:21:47,080 --> 03:21:49,080
Taking out the trash.

2146
03:21:49,080 --> 03:21:50,080
Taking out the trash.

2147
03:21:52,080 --> 03:21:53,080
Okay, there we go.

2148
03:21:54,080 --> 03:21:55,080
You know what always bothered me?

2149
03:21:55,080 --> 03:21:56,080
When you kill some evil bloke

2150
03:21:56,080 --> 03:21:59,080
and then Exo is cradling like a babysitter recipe,

2151
03:22:00,080 --> 03:22:01,080
he has...

2152
03:22:01,080 --> 03:22:03,080
Whoa, what was that?

2153
03:22:03,080 --> 03:22:05,080
Was that scaffolding in that cutscene?

2154
03:22:07,080 --> 03:22:09,080
The camera is so good in this game.

2155
03:22:09,080 --> 03:22:10,080
Like it's so good.

2156
03:22:12,080 --> 03:22:16,080
Do you guys remember the asset repeating?

2157
03:22:17,080 --> 03:22:20,080
I'm going to show you an asset that was repeated.

2158
03:22:20,080 --> 03:22:22,080
It's right in this next quest.

2159
03:22:23,080 --> 03:22:25,080
So remember how he was holding his arm

2160
03:22:25,080 --> 03:22:27,080
and he was injured?

2161
03:22:27,080 --> 03:22:29,080
Well, guess what?

2162
03:22:29,080 --> 03:22:31,080
This is where they reused the asset.

2163
03:22:31,080 --> 03:22:33,080
On this little crying kid.

2164
03:22:33,080 --> 03:22:34,080
Don't worry.

2165
03:22:34,080 --> 03:22:36,080
There's not a random kid crying in your headset.

2166
03:22:36,080 --> 03:22:37,080
It's part of the game.

2167
03:22:39,080 --> 03:22:42,080
This is a shrunken down version

2168
03:22:42,080 --> 03:22:44,080
of that guy that got injured.

2169
03:22:44,080 --> 03:22:45,080
Not at this stage,

2170
03:22:45,080 --> 03:22:46,080
but it's the same clothes and all that.

2171
03:22:46,080 --> 03:22:48,080
And when he walks away, you can see it.

2172
03:22:49,080 --> 03:22:51,080
Okay, so stare at him.

2173
03:22:52,080 --> 03:22:54,080
We know you use reused assets.

2174
03:22:54,080 --> 03:22:56,080
You be soft, we know.

2175
03:22:57,080 --> 03:22:59,080
This is the next one.

2176
03:23:01,080 --> 03:23:02,080
Sleepy.

2177
03:23:04,080 --> 03:23:05,080
You are scary,

2178
03:23:05,080 --> 03:23:07,080
but you look very brave.

2179
03:23:11,080 --> 03:23:13,080
Right, now watch him walk away.

2180
03:23:15,080 --> 03:23:17,080
You think you can distract me, video game?

2181
03:23:17,080 --> 03:23:19,080
I'm on to your secrets.

2182
03:23:21,080 --> 03:23:23,080
You might as well have me on the dev team.

2183
03:23:23,080 --> 03:23:24,080
Look at this walk!

2184
03:23:25,080 --> 03:23:26,080
He's injured!

2185
03:23:26,080 --> 03:23:28,080
I can see it!

2186
03:23:28,080 --> 03:23:29,080
You can't hide that from me.

2187
03:23:29,080 --> 03:23:31,080
I've played this game far too many times.

2188
03:23:31,080 --> 03:23:33,080
That's just the injured thief.

2189
03:23:33,080 --> 03:23:35,080
Asset reused.

2190
03:23:35,080 --> 03:23:38,080
You can't get away from me.

2191
03:23:39,080 --> 03:23:40,080
Honestly,

2192
03:23:40,080 --> 03:23:42,080
I wonder if there is behind the scenes development

2193
03:23:42,080 --> 03:23:43,080
of Brotherhood,

2194
03:23:43,080 --> 03:23:45,080
because I actually haven't consumed any of that.

2195
03:23:45,080 --> 03:23:46,080
And if there is,

2196
03:23:46,080 --> 03:23:49,080
I know what I'm doing the moment I go to bed.

2197
03:23:50,080 --> 03:23:53,080
Among other things after looking at Marshmallow,

2198
03:23:53,080 --> 03:23:55,080
hehehehehe.

2199
03:23:56,080 --> 03:23:58,080
Okay, we do have two assassin signals,

2200
03:23:58,080 --> 03:23:59,080
which is really good,

2201
03:23:59,080 --> 03:24:03,080
but I should probably send the recruits away

2202
03:24:03,080 --> 03:24:04,080
just to get stronger,

2203
03:24:04,080 --> 03:24:05,080
but not right now,

2204
03:24:05,080 --> 03:24:06,080
because we're in the middle of a secret.

2205
03:24:06,080 --> 03:24:08,080
I'm just going to start upgrading stuff

2206
03:24:08,080 --> 03:24:09,080
as I find them.

2207
03:24:12,080 --> 03:24:13,080
Yeah.

2208
03:24:13,080 --> 03:24:16,080
Injured thief number 312.

2209
03:24:20,080 --> 03:24:21,080
Okay, camera angle, please.

2210
03:24:21,080 --> 03:24:22,080
Ow!

2211
03:24:22,080 --> 03:24:24,080
I just bumped into those guards.

2212
03:24:24,080 --> 03:24:26,080
They literally could have reprimanded me for doing that,

2213
03:24:26,080 --> 03:24:27,080
but I guess not.

2214
03:24:27,080 --> 03:24:29,080
Right, we have two assassin signals,

2215
03:24:29,080 --> 03:24:30,080
which is good.

2216
03:24:30,080 --> 03:24:32,080
Actually, I'm going to send them a fight

2217
03:24:32,080 --> 03:24:34,080
to get some experience,

2218
03:24:34,080 --> 03:24:37,080
because I need to get them strong.

2219
03:24:39,080 --> 03:24:42,080
So, we're just going to watch them do their thing.

2220
03:24:42,080 --> 03:24:44,080
Hopefully they'll hurry up and get some XP.

2221
03:24:46,080 --> 03:24:47,080
Yep.

2222
03:24:47,080 --> 03:24:48,080
Take your time.

2223
03:24:48,080 --> 03:24:49,080
There you go.

2224
03:24:49,080 --> 03:24:51,080
They get XP every time you call them

2225
03:24:51,080 --> 03:24:53,080
into a battle or send them in missions.

2226
03:24:53,080 --> 03:24:54,080
It's not a problem.

2227
03:24:54,080 --> 03:24:55,080
There we go.

2228
03:24:55,080 --> 03:24:56,080
And they've respawned,

2229
03:24:56,080 --> 03:24:57,080
so it's all good.

2230
03:24:57,080 --> 03:24:59,080
We will keep another signal

2231
03:24:59,080 --> 03:25:01,080
to do this mission, though,

2232
03:25:01,080 --> 03:25:02,080
because to get 100%,

2233
03:25:02,080 --> 03:25:04,080
you have to send your signal

2234
03:25:04,080 --> 03:25:05,080
to kill the person.

2235
03:25:05,080 --> 03:25:06,080
Again, another multiplayer character,

2236
03:25:06,080 --> 03:25:08,080
which is why they're so designed.

2237
03:25:12,080 --> 03:25:14,080
I can't really remember.

2238
03:25:14,080 --> 03:25:16,080
He looks behind you

2239
03:25:16,080 --> 03:25:18,080
on the bridge a lot,

2240
03:25:18,080 --> 03:25:20,080
and I like to write on corners.

2241
03:25:20,080 --> 03:25:22,080
It's quite funny, actually.

2242
03:25:25,080 --> 03:25:27,080
You don't ever use the recruits.

2243
03:25:27,080 --> 03:25:28,080
Are you joking?

2244
03:25:28,080 --> 03:25:29,080
That's the best part about this game.

2245
03:25:29,080 --> 03:25:30,080
If you suck at video gaming,

2246
03:25:30,080 --> 03:25:32,080
you can literally just call in the recruits

2247
03:25:32,080 --> 03:25:34,080
to do everything for you.

2248
03:25:35,080 --> 03:25:38,080
He should start running in a second.

2249
03:25:39,080 --> 03:25:40,080
No, around the corner he runs,

2250
03:25:40,080 --> 03:25:42,080
because we're to go over there.

2251
03:25:48,080 --> 03:25:49,080
He's like,

2252
03:25:49,080 --> 03:25:51,080
yes, there's absolutely no one on this bridge

2253
03:25:51,080 --> 03:25:53,080
that looks threatening to me whatsoever.

2254
03:25:53,080 --> 03:25:55,080
Me just standing,

2255
03:25:55,080 --> 03:25:57,080
not even hiding in the crowd or anything,

2256
03:25:57,080 --> 03:25:59,080
and stops...

2257
03:25:59,080 --> 03:26:01,080
Oh, see, he's bumping into NPCs.

2258
03:26:01,080 --> 03:26:03,080
That's the biggest thing about tailing.

2259
03:26:03,080 --> 03:26:04,080
If that NPC bumps them,

2260
03:26:04,080 --> 03:26:05,080
they can turn around

2261
03:26:05,080 --> 03:26:06,080
and look you right in the eyes,

2262
03:26:06,080 --> 03:26:07,080
and you're like,

2263
03:26:07,080 --> 03:26:09,080
oops, you're not really supposed to do that.

2264
03:26:09,080 --> 03:26:11,080
He literally has a knife out,

2265
03:26:11,080 --> 03:26:13,080
and we're gonna...

2266
03:26:13,080 --> 03:26:14,080
I think he looks back here,

2267
03:26:14,080 --> 03:26:16,080
and then, yeah,

2268
03:26:16,080 --> 03:26:17,080
I remembered.

2269
03:26:17,080 --> 03:26:18,080
He looks back here,

2270
03:26:18,080 --> 03:26:20,080
and then he looks back as after he does a sprint

2271
03:26:20,080 --> 03:26:22,080
on top of the stairs, okay?

2272
03:26:22,080 --> 03:26:23,080
You're getting all the strats,

2273
03:26:23,080 --> 03:26:24,080
so he doesn't look back anymore

2274
03:26:24,080 --> 03:26:26,080
unless he gets bumped,

2275
03:26:26,080 --> 03:26:28,080
which he shouldn't.

2276
03:26:28,080 --> 03:26:29,080
No, he didn't.

2277
03:26:29,080 --> 03:26:30,080
He didn't. That's good.

2278
03:26:32,080 --> 03:26:35,080
And then he's about to break out in a sprint.

2279
03:26:35,080 --> 03:26:37,080
Hey, that's right.

2280
03:26:37,080 --> 03:26:39,080
And then you follow him,

2281
03:26:39,080 --> 03:26:41,080
and then the game wants you to...

2282
03:26:44,080 --> 03:26:47,080
I don't think he should have turned around at that point.

2283
03:26:47,080 --> 03:26:48,080
No, he shouldn't have.

2284
03:26:48,080 --> 03:26:49,080
I don't know why he did.

2285
03:26:49,080 --> 03:26:52,080
He's not coded to turn around at that section.

2286
03:26:52,080 --> 03:26:53,080
He's coded to turn around,

2287
03:26:53,080 --> 03:26:55,080
like, at the top of these stairs.

2288
03:26:56,080 --> 03:26:58,080
Unless the sequence broke.

2289
03:27:00,080 --> 03:27:01,080
Okay, the sequence broke

2290
03:27:01,080 --> 03:27:02,080
because he's supposed to do it

2291
03:27:02,080 --> 03:27:03,080
at the top of those stairs.

2292
03:27:03,080 --> 03:27:04,080
My goodness.

2293
03:27:04,080 --> 03:27:06,080
I thought we were about to desync there.

2294
03:27:07,080 --> 03:27:08,080
Not a game.

2295
03:27:08,080 --> 03:27:09,080
Not a game.

2296
03:27:09,080 --> 03:27:11,080
You gave me a heart attack.

2297
03:27:11,080 --> 03:27:14,080
We must ensure that the kidnappings continue.

2298
03:27:15,080 --> 03:27:17,080
No, there will be no kidnapping.

2299
03:27:18,080 --> 03:27:19,080
Hee hee hee.

2300
03:27:21,080 --> 03:27:23,080
Requiescati bacce.

2301
03:27:24,080 --> 03:27:26,080
Requiescati bacce.

2302
03:27:27,080 --> 03:27:29,080
And look at his hook arm.

2303
03:27:29,080 --> 03:27:31,080
Yawing, using that for a design.

2304
03:27:35,080 --> 03:27:37,080
I've got two sets of recruits.

2305
03:27:37,080 --> 03:27:39,080
Can they hurt these guys without dying?

2306
03:27:40,080 --> 03:27:43,080
I want them to get XP for fighting.

2307
03:27:44,080 --> 03:27:46,080
Can they do it without Persian?

2308
03:27:46,080 --> 03:27:49,080
I think they can, but no one leveled up.

2309
03:27:49,080 --> 03:27:51,080
Not one person leveled up doing that.

2310
03:27:51,080 --> 03:27:52,080
Nah, you're done.

2311
03:27:52,080 --> 03:27:53,080
You're naughty.

2312
03:27:53,080 --> 03:27:55,080
Users supposed to level up.

2313
03:27:57,080 --> 03:27:59,080
Did I get into the multiplayer?

2314
03:27:59,080 --> 03:28:01,080
No, I didn't actually.

2315
03:28:02,080 --> 03:28:03,080
I can't quite remember.

2316
03:28:03,080 --> 03:28:05,080
I think it was like you hide among the...

2317
03:28:05,080 --> 03:28:06,080
Oh, someone did level up.

2318
03:28:06,080 --> 03:28:08,080
We'll give her a weapon.

2319
03:28:09,080 --> 03:28:11,080
Look, we've got so many assassins.

2320
03:28:11,080 --> 03:28:14,080
I'm going to send them on...

2321
03:28:14,080 --> 03:28:15,080
Missions.

2322
03:28:15,080 --> 03:28:18,080
Sorry if this looks like chaotic mess on the screen right now.

2323
03:28:18,080 --> 03:28:20,080
It's just I've done it so many times.

2324
03:28:20,080 --> 03:28:23,080
You need to look for difficulty level 1 missions

2325
03:28:23,080 --> 03:28:24,080
and then send the recruit on it

2326
03:28:24,080 --> 03:28:26,080
and it will automatically make them level 2

2327
03:28:26,080 --> 03:28:30,080
so they can at least have a bit more of a fight into them.

2328
03:28:32,080 --> 03:28:34,080
The pigeons' eyes.

2329
03:28:35,080 --> 03:28:37,080
They're a bit...

2330
03:28:38,080 --> 03:28:40,080
Look, the game's from 2010.

2331
03:28:40,080 --> 03:28:43,080
Okay, it's an older game.

2332
03:28:43,080 --> 03:28:45,080
I'm not going to steal a horse.

2333
03:28:45,080 --> 03:28:46,080
That's not nice.

2334
03:28:46,080 --> 03:28:48,080
Committing Grand Horse Aul.

2335
03:28:48,080 --> 03:28:50,080
But we'll do this.

2336
03:28:50,080 --> 03:28:51,080
Have you played Unity?

2337
03:28:51,080 --> 03:28:52,080
I haven't.

2338
03:28:52,080 --> 03:28:54,080
I played Assassin's Creed,

2339
03:28:54,080 --> 03:28:55,080
Ezio's storyline,

2340
03:28:55,080 --> 03:28:56,080
and then I played 3

2341
03:28:56,080 --> 03:28:59,080
and I didn't really enjoy it so much.

2342
03:28:59,080 --> 03:29:04,080
And then I played Black Flag,

2343
03:29:04,080 --> 03:29:07,080
but I suck at it

2344
03:29:07,080 --> 03:29:09,080
because they changed the controls

2345
03:29:09,080 --> 03:29:11,080
and I'm absolutely awful at it

2346
03:29:11,080 --> 03:29:13,080
and I've never actually successfully completed it.

2347
03:29:13,080 --> 03:29:15,080
I have no idea where I'm supposed to go.

2348
03:29:15,080 --> 03:29:19,080
I think I'm going to go into the Tiberina Island.

2349
03:29:22,080 --> 03:29:23,080
I'll just use that bridge there.

2350
03:29:23,080 --> 03:29:24,080
That looks right.

2351
03:29:27,080 --> 03:29:28,080
You enjoyed your night?

2352
03:29:28,080 --> 03:29:29,080
I know Odyssey came out.

2353
03:29:29,080 --> 03:29:30,080
I never played that.

2354
03:29:30,080 --> 03:29:31,080
Like, the newer Assassin's Creed

2355
03:29:31,080 --> 03:29:33,080
I'm absolutely not familiar with at all.

2356
03:29:33,080 --> 03:29:34,080
I do apologize.

2357
03:29:34,080 --> 03:29:35,080
I mean, maybe we can play it

2358
03:29:35,080 --> 03:29:36,080
for the first time together.

2359
03:29:40,080 --> 03:29:43,080
I think Odyssey got a really good reputation.

2360
03:29:43,080 --> 03:29:45,080
I know there's that Japanese.

2361
03:29:45,080 --> 03:29:46,080
Where the heck am I trying to go?

2362
03:29:46,080 --> 03:29:48,080
Sorry, I'm getting so distracted.

2363
03:29:48,080 --> 03:29:50,080
Talking and playing at the same time.

2364
03:29:50,080 --> 03:29:51,080
I'm sorry.

2365
03:29:52,080 --> 03:29:55,080
Guess who we're about to meet?

2366
03:29:55,080 --> 03:29:56,080
Are you ready?

2367
03:29:58,080 --> 03:29:59,080
It's you.

2368
03:29:59,080 --> 03:30:00,080
It's you.

2369
03:30:02,080 --> 03:30:04,080
Who are we about to meet?

2370
03:30:15,080 --> 03:30:17,080
Leonardo da Vinci himself.

2371
03:30:23,080 --> 03:30:24,080
Hello, Leonardo.

2372
03:30:24,080 --> 03:30:26,080
Long time no see, buddy.

2373
03:30:30,080 --> 03:30:33,080
So, remember when Chesery said

2374
03:30:33,080 --> 03:30:35,080
the gun was crafted by a friend of mine?

2375
03:30:35,080 --> 03:30:38,080
It was crafted by Leonardo.

2376
03:30:38,080 --> 03:30:40,080
Because he's my friend.

2377
03:30:40,080 --> 03:30:42,080
Oh, congrats if your name's Leonardo.

2378
03:30:48,080 --> 03:30:50,080
He wanted to chop that thing off.

2379
03:30:51,080 --> 03:30:54,080
I don't get any of the modern ACs.

2380
03:30:54,080 --> 03:30:56,080
They don't have charm.

2381
03:30:56,080 --> 03:30:58,080
Yeah, the apple.

2382
03:31:00,080 --> 03:31:03,080
I gave the apple to Mario.

2383
03:31:03,080 --> 03:31:04,080
I am sorry.

2384
03:31:04,080 --> 03:31:05,080
Don't say that.

2385
03:31:05,080 --> 03:31:07,080
What's 100% thing for the tank mission?

2386
03:31:07,080 --> 03:31:09,080
You're making me scared now.

2387
03:31:10,080 --> 03:31:13,080
What's 100% thing for the tank mission?

2388
03:31:14,080 --> 03:31:15,080
Is it hard?

2389
03:31:16,080 --> 03:31:18,080
I thought this game was pretty gamer friendly.

2390
03:31:23,080 --> 03:31:24,080
You're making me now.

2391
03:31:24,080 --> 03:31:26,080
I'm starting to break out in a sweat.

2392
03:31:26,080 --> 03:31:27,080
We ain't even played the tank mission yet.

2393
03:31:27,080 --> 03:31:29,080
Oh no, what is it?

2394
03:31:30,080 --> 03:31:31,080
Stop!

2395
03:31:31,080 --> 03:31:32,080
Stop!

2396
03:31:32,080 --> 03:31:33,080
Is it bad?

2397
03:31:33,080 --> 03:31:35,080
360 hours for this dream?

2398
03:31:40,080 --> 03:31:41,080
I'm sweating.

2399
03:31:41,080 --> 03:31:43,080
Leonardo, he's drawing, he's doing his thing.

2400
03:31:45,080 --> 03:31:48,080
Did you know Leonardo da Vinci liked Willy?

2401
03:31:48,080 --> 03:31:50,080
That's a true fact.

2402
03:31:51,080 --> 03:31:54,080
You're getting educated with me.

2403
03:31:55,080 --> 03:31:56,080
The tank mission?

2404
03:31:56,080 --> 03:31:58,080
Oh, you're making me nervous.

2405
03:32:00,080 --> 03:32:02,080
I'm getting scared.

2406
03:32:04,080 --> 03:32:08,080
Is the tank mission where you have to claim all the towers and stuff?

2407
03:32:10,080 --> 03:32:12,080
I like to get the thing.

2408
03:32:12,080 --> 03:32:13,080
Okay, we have a long double blade.

2409
03:32:13,080 --> 03:32:15,080
We can now do double assassinations,

2410
03:32:15,080 --> 03:32:16,080
which is one of...

2411
03:32:16,080 --> 03:32:19,080
That was me slapping my leg before anyone claims that it was a fart.

2412
03:32:20,080 --> 03:32:21,080
I already know what I'm doing.

2413
03:32:21,080 --> 03:32:23,080
Fart and don't ever...

2414
03:32:24,080 --> 03:32:26,080
We're just unlocking new weaponry.

2415
03:32:26,080 --> 03:32:28,080
The next thing we're going to unlock is a leap glove,

2416
03:32:28,080 --> 03:32:35,080
which is fantastic to make jump-claiming about much easier.

2417
03:32:39,080 --> 03:32:40,080
I just remembered the tank mission.

2418
03:32:40,080 --> 03:32:42,080
I'm getting fucking nervous.

2419
03:32:43,080 --> 03:32:45,080
We're making me scared for when we do it.

2420
03:32:45,080 --> 03:32:47,080
I was going to leave the missions all to the end,

2421
03:32:47,080 --> 03:32:48,080
so we're doing story mode,

2422
03:32:48,080 --> 03:32:50,080
and then all the side quests stuff tomorrow,

2423
03:32:50,080 --> 03:32:52,080
and then 100% sync.

2424
03:32:54,080 --> 03:32:56,080
I don't know where we're heading next.

2425
03:32:56,080 --> 03:32:57,080
Oh, okay.

2426
03:32:57,080 --> 03:32:59,080
800 meters!

2427
03:32:59,080 --> 03:33:01,080
That's so far away.

2428
03:33:01,080 --> 03:33:03,080
I don't know if we can take an aqueduct.

2429
03:33:06,080 --> 03:33:11,080
We can take an aqueduct to...

2430
03:33:11,080 --> 03:33:13,080
Where the heck are the aqueducts?

2431
03:33:13,080 --> 03:33:14,080
Okay, behind me.

2432
03:33:14,080 --> 03:33:17,080
We can take an aqueduct to the mercenaries,

2433
03:33:17,080 --> 03:33:20,080
and then we'll just have to horse on the rest.

2434
03:33:25,080 --> 03:33:28,080
I'm getting nervous in case I can't 100% it.

2435
03:33:28,080 --> 03:33:31,080
It's literally in the title of tomorrow's stream.

2436
03:33:31,080 --> 03:33:32,080
I'm getting nervous.

2437
03:33:32,080 --> 03:33:33,080
I'm getting shaky.

2438
03:33:33,080 --> 03:33:35,080
Okay, I'm getting nervous.

2439
03:33:37,080 --> 03:33:38,080
Where am I trying to?

2440
03:33:38,080 --> 03:33:39,080
I'm trying to teleport.

2441
03:33:39,080 --> 03:33:42,080
Okay, first I need to go inside the guild,

2442
03:33:42,080 --> 03:33:47,080
and then I need to go to the mercenaries on the map,

2443
03:33:47,080 --> 03:33:53,080
and then we're going to do the first of the Leonardo missions.

2444
03:33:53,080 --> 03:33:54,080
Where's the heck?

2445
03:33:54,080 --> 03:33:55,080
Where's the heck?

2446
03:33:55,080 --> 03:33:56,080
Oh, there.

2447
03:33:56,080 --> 03:33:57,080
I'm literally right here.

2448
03:33:57,080 --> 03:33:58,080
Here, right here.

2449
03:34:01,080 --> 03:34:03,080
Yes, we'll do the Leonardo...

2450
03:34:03,080 --> 03:34:05,080
First Leonardo mission.

2451
03:34:05,080 --> 03:34:07,080
I will do the others at the end,

2452
03:34:07,080 --> 03:34:09,080
because I think it takes far too long to do them,

2453
03:34:09,080 --> 03:34:10,080
in my humble opinion,

2454
03:34:10,080 --> 03:34:12,080
although I can't remember them.

2455
03:34:12,080 --> 03:34:14,080
The layer of Romulus are like,

2456
03:34:14,080 --> 03:34:17,080
pretty good for climbing,

2457
03:34:17,080 --> 03:34:19,080
for those interested in climbing.

2458
03:34:19,080 --> 03:34:21,080
Where's my horse?

2459
03:34:21,080 --> 03:34:22,080
My horse.

2460
03:34:22,080 --> 03:34:23,080
Come here.

2461
03:34:23,080 --> 03:34:25,080
You're teasing me.

2462
03:34:25,080 --> 03:34:26,080
Okay, right.

2463
03:34:26,080 --> 03:34:30,080
We will very quickly skedaddle over to this area.

2464
03:34:30,080 --> 03:34:34,080
We actually still haven't unlocked the full map yet.

2465
03:34:34,080 --> 03:34:38,080
You don't unlock the full map until sequence 7, I think.

2466
03:34:38,080 --> 03:34:40,080
Act 7.

2467
03:34:40,080 --> 03:34:43,080
So we might hit a boundary wall.

2468
03:34:43,080 --> 03:34:45,080
I'm not sure if I'm going the right way.

2469
03:34:45,080 --> 03:34:48,080
There's multiple ways you can make your way to the location,

2470
03:34:48,080 --> 03:34:50,080
but I think I've done it right.

2471
03:34:50,080 --> 03:34:52,080
Yes, the boundary wall right there.

2472
03:34:52,080 --> 03:34:56,080
So we are doing it right in quotation marks.

2473
03:34:56,080 --> 03:34:58,080
Is it up or down?

2474
03:34:58,080 --> 03:35:01,080
Why are you sitting on the horse like that?

2475
03:35:01,080 --> 03:35:02,080
What is it?

2476
03:35:02,080 --> 03:35:04,080
Explain yourself.

2477
03:35:07,080 --> 03:35:08,080
Okay, we did it.

2478
03:35:08,080 --> 03:35:09,080
We did it.

2479
03:35:09,080 --> 03:35:10,080
We're here.

2480
03:35:10,080 --> 03:35:12,080
I think we just have a really basic mayor scenario,

2481
03:35:12,080 --> 03:35:16,080
and then we will do the first Leonardo mission,

2482
03:35:16,080 --> 03:35:17,080
which I hate,

2483
03:35:17,080 --> 03:35:19,080
because we've actually not got the crossbow bolt,

2484
03:35:19,080 --> 03:35:21,080
which is much easier if you have the fricking crossbow bolt,

2485
03:35:21,080 --> 03:35:23,080
but it's fine.

2486
03:35:23,080 --> 03:35:26,080
The mercenary should spawn in right in front of us.

2487
03:35:26,080 --> 03:35:28,080
3, 2, 1, A.

2488
03:35:28,080 --> 03:35:29,080
That's right.

2489
03:35:29,080 --> 03:35:30,080
You yikers.

2490
03:35:30,080 --> 03:35:31,080
Come with me.

2491
03:35:31,080 --> 03:35:32,080
Come with me.

2492
03:35:32,080 --> 03:35:34,080
You're going to beat these people up for me.

2493
03:35:34,080 --> 03:35:35,080
Thank you.

2494
03:35:37,080 --> 03:35:40,080
And just tell them to fight like that.

2495
03:35:40,080 --> 03:35:42,080
And that is how you utilize the mercenary.

2496
03:35:42,080 --> 03:35:44,080
Sorry, I'm itching my eyeball.

2497
03:35:44,080 --> 03:35:48,080
I have a real eyelash again.

2498
03:35:48,080 --> 03:35:50,080
And then basically, they just do all the work.

2499
03:35:50,080 --> 03:35:52,080
I can call my assassins and...

2500
03:35:52,080 --> 03:35:53,080
You know what?

2501
03:35:53,080 --> 03:35:54,080
I'll do it for the XP there.

2502
03:35:54,080 --> 03:35:55,080
Oh!

2503
03:35:55,080 --> 03:35:57,080
I just unlocked an assassin from everything.

2504
03:35:57,080 --> 03:35:58,080
I'll take it.

2505
03:35:58,080 --> 03:36:00,080
No, I'm kind of through with that.

2506
03:36:02,080 --> 03:36:03,080
Ooh.

2507
03:36:03,080 --> 03:36:04,080
Okay, done.

2508
03:36:08,080 --> 03:36:11,080
Okay, we now are going on a mission

2509
03:36:11,080 --> 03:36:13,080
in a different location.

2510
03:36:13,080 --> 03:36:15,080
Map retrieve from the overseer.

2511
03:36:15,080 --> 03:36:17,080
I cannot read that fast,

2512
03:36:17,080 --> 03:36:19,080
but thank you, game, for having faith in me

2513
03:36:19,080 --> 03:36:21,080
that I can read that fast.

2514
03:36:21,080 --> 03:36:24,080
But the truth of the matter is, I can't.

2515
03:36:24,080 --> 03:36:25,080
Don't do that.

2516
03:36:25,080 --> 03:36:27,080
Don't let that happen again.

2517
03:36:27,080 --> 03:36:29,080
Have a little drink of water, game.

2518
03:36:29,080 --> 03:36:30,080
Game, game.

2519
03:36:30,080 --> 03:36:31,080
My voice is dying.

2520
03:36:31,080 --> 03:36:33,080
I don't know if you can tell how messed up my voice is

2521
03:36:33,080 --> 03:36:36,080
or if it just kind of sounds like my normal voice at this part.

2522
03:36:39,080 --> 03:36:41,080
I'll go with the machine gun.

2523
03:36:43,080 --> 03:36:46,080
So, this 100% is don't kill anyone.

2524
03:36:46,080 --> 03:36:47,080
I have never done that before.

2525
03:36:47,080 --> 03:36:49,080
I always kill people.

2526
03:36:51,080 --> 03:36:54,080
And it's like, really, it's so much easier

2527
03:36:54,080 --> 03:36:56,080
if you have the crossbow bolt,

2528
03:36:56,080 --> 03:37:01,080
because, like, for goodness' sake, it...

2529
03:37:04,080 --> 03:37:08,080
Because the crossbow bolt doesn't give your location away,

2530
03:37:08,080 --> 03:37:12,080
but the bullets of the gun do, it's pretty bad.

2531
03:37:12,080 --> 03:37:14,080
I'm actually not wanting to move.

2532
03:37:14,080 --> 03:37:17,080
Yeah, that's why, because they turn around.

2533
03:37:18,080 --> 03:37:20,080
I'm gonna yank him.

2534
03:37:21,080 --> 03:37:24,080
I'm actually wanting to go back and kill that guy

2535
03:37:24,080 --> 03:37:26,080
if I'm being honest.

2536
03:37:28,080 --> 03:37:32,080
Maybe don't have to, question mark.

2537
03:37:34,080 --> 03:37:37,080
There is a rotating guard ahead, which I don't like.

2538
03:37:37,080 --> 03:37:38,080
Oh, he's coming!

2539
03:37:38,080 --> 03:37:39,080
Are you joking me?

2540
03:37:39,080 --> 03:37:40,080
I've just missed him.

2541
03:37:40,080 --> 03:37:42,080
Oh, just missed him.

2542
03:37:42,080 --> 03:37:45,080
We need to shoot him in order to get where we need to go.

2543
03:37:50,080 --> 03:37:52,080
There's two bullets.

2544
03:37:53,080 --> 03:37:56,080
Whenever there's a pigeon ledge, that means you can do a leap of faith.

2545
03:37:59,080 --> 03:38:01,080
Your enthusiasm of the game is cute.

2546
03:38:01,080 --> 03:38:03,080
It's just such a good game.

2547
03:38:05,080 --> 03:38:07,080
So, as long as he doesn't turn around.

2548
03:38:07,080 --> 03:38:10,080
If you run, it'll notify the guard of you.

2549
03:38:10,080 --> 03:38:13,080
So, don't run when you do these kind of things.

2550
03:38:13,080 --> 03:38:17,080
Or else the guards, the AI is basically going to be like,

2551
03:38:17,080 --> 03:38:18,080
I have found you.

2552
03:38:18,080 --> 03:38:21,080
And then you're like, please don't do that.

2553
03:38:21,080 --> 03:38:22,080
I would like to be uncalled,

2554
03:38:22,080 --> 03:38:25,080
because I don't want to redo this entire sequence all over again.

2555
03:38:29,080 --> 03:38:33,080
Okay, this is a bit of an issue.

2556
03:38:34,080 --> 03:38:36,080
There's a guard that rotates around the century of the wall,

2557
03:38:36,080 --> 03:38:39,080
and that one up there, I need to shoot both of them, basically.

2558
03:38:39,080 --> 03:38:41,080
But I need to wait until the other one rotates away.

2559
03:38:41,080 --> 03:38:43,080
Why don't you just hypnotize the guard?

2560
03:38:43,080 --> 03:38:45,080
For real!

2561
03:38:45,080 --> 03:38:47,080
But they can't see me from this distance.

2562
03:38:47,080 --> 03:38:49,080
I'm potent, I'm not that potent.

2563
03:38:49,080 --> 03:38:51,080
Right, so we can do that, at least.

2564
03:38:51,080 --> 03:38:54,080
And then, maybe...

2565
03:38:54,080 --> 03:38:56,080
Wait, there's a guy there.

2566
03:38:56,080 --> 03:38:58,080
Oh, I don't like that.

2567
03:38:59,080 --> 03:39:02,080
Uh...

2568
03:39:06,080 --> 03:39:10,080
Sorry, this part, you can fuck up so easily.

2569
03:39:10,080 --> 03:39:13,080
Okay, we didn't fuck up.

2570
03:39:13,080 --> 03:39:15,080
Burn it, and then we get this checkpoint.

2571
03:39:15,080 --> 03:39:17,080
Okay.

2572
03:39:17,080 --> 03:39:19,080
Ta-da!

2573
03:39:19,080 --> 03:39:21,080
We have achieved the checkpoint, we no longer have to sneak around.

2574
03:39:21,080 --> 03:39:23,080
We can just do our thing.

2575
03:39:23,080 --> 03:39:25,080
Pew!

2576
03:39:25,080 --> 03:39:27,080
I don't ever want to do that again.

2577
03:39:27,080 --> 03:39:30,080
She says, as she has to do it again.

2578
03:39:30,080 --> 03:39:34,080
You can just drop down, doesn't cause any damage to you.

2579
03:39:34,080 --> 03:39:39,080
But the music creators for the speed-up song,

2580
03:39:39,080 --> 03:39:43,080
like that is so terrifying.

2581
03:39:43,080 --> 03:39:45,080
It strikes blood into the hearts.

2582
03:39:45,080 --> 03:39:48,080
It strikes fear into the hearts, not blood into the hearts.

2583
03:39:48,080 --> 03:39:52,080
I mean, that's what hearts do, they pump blood around and stuff.

2584
03:39:53,080 --> 03:39:56,080
Get all oxygenated again.

2585
03:39:56,080 --> 03:39:59,080
Okay, this is the part I freaking hate.

2586
03:39:59,080 --> 03:40:02,080
Because I don't know how to, like, not get it to lock on.

2587
03:40:02,080 --> 03:40:05,080
You can literally go side to side and evade.

2588
03:40:05,080 --> 03:40:08,080
And you will still get... Why are there people there?

2589
03:40:08,080 --> 03:40:12,080
Like, I'm evading, but I'm probably going to get hit.

2590
03:40:12,080 --> 03:40:15,080
I don't know how to not get hit.

2591
03:40:15,080 --> 03:40:18,080
I played this so many times.

2592
03:40:19,080 --> 03:40:21,080
Although I did evade all of those,

2593
03:40:21,080 --> 03:40:25,080
so maybe my swirling is doing much better.

2594
03:40:25,080 --> 03:40:29,080
Evasive maneuvers, evasive maneuvers!

2595
03:40:29,080 --> 03:40:31,080
Ah, see, I don't get it!

2596
03:40:31,080 --> 03:40:33,080
I'm literally going side to side.

2597
03:40:33,080 --> 03:40:35,080
I wonder if it's a distance thing as well.

2598
03:40:35,080 --> 03:40:37,080
Like, if I get too close, the game's like,

2599
03:40:37,080 --> 03:40:39,080
you're not allowed to get that close,

2600
03:40:39,080 --> 03:40:42,080
and it's like, oh, sorry, you didn't really explain.

2601
03:40:42,080 --> 03:40:45,080
Like, pardon my French,

2602
03:40:45,080 --> 03:40:49,080
but je n'ai c'est quoi, on what's going on me.

2603
03:40:51,080 --> 03:40:53,080
Okay, let's go. Next sequence.

2604
03:40:53,080 --> 03:40:55,080
This is actually pretty badass.

2605
03:40:55,080 --> 03:40:58,080
I can't seem to have to admit.

2606
03:41:06,080 --> 03:41:08,080
Stabbed-in throw SFX.

2607
03:41:10,080 --> 03:41:12,080
We will use the tactical camera,

2608
03:41:12,080 --> 03:41:15,080
because it's literally, like, if you're down here,

2609
03:41:15,080 --> 03:41:17,080
it's like so close.

2610
03:41:17,080 --> 03:41:21,080
And you can use the map to see who's coming up,

2611
03:41:21,080 --> 03:41:23,080
so I can see there's one on the right,

2612
03:41:23,080 --> 03:41:25,080
and then we're going to swing back left,

2613
03:41:25,080 --> 03:41:27,080
and then we're going to swing back right.

2614
03:41:27,080 --> 03:41:30,080
You don't need to worry about the archers at all

2615
03:41:30,080 --> 03:41:32,080
in this part of the mission.

2616
03:41:32,080 --> 03:41:34,080
They don't hurt you.

2617
03:41:34,080 --> 03:41:36,080
I've never been hurt,

2618
03:41:36,080 --> 03:41:39,080
but you can see left side again on the red dot map,

2619
03:41:39,080 --> 03:41:41,080
which I'm covering up! Lovely!

2620
03:41:41,080 --> 03:41:45,080
I just realised I'm covering up the entirety of the map,

2621
03:41:45,080 --> 03:41:48,080
so you can't see any of that that I've just been commentating on.

2622
03:41:48,080 --> 03:41:50,080
I do apologise.

2623
03:41:53,080 --> 03:41:55,080
Again, the horses always get up.

2624
03:41:55,080 --> 03:41:57,080
Please don't worry. The horsey-worsies are fine.

2625
03:41:57,080 --> 03:42:02,080
You can pre-fire when the red markers spawn in.

2626
03:42:02,080 --> 03:42:04,080
You can get to it.

2627
03:42:04,080 --> 03:42:07,080
And you can, like, hit them before the markers actually show up,

2628
03:42:07,080 --> 03:42:09,080
because that's really loud.

2629
03:42:09,080 --> 03:42:11,080
Hopefully that's not too loud for you guys.

2630
03:42:15,080 --> 03:42:17,080
The horses are fine. Please don't worry.

2631
03:42:17,080 --> 03:42:19,080
All horses get back up in the game.

2632
03:42:23,080 --> 03:42:26,080
If they aim a bit too close, they're going to get me.

2633
03:42:29,080 --> 03:42:31,080
Am I going to get away with that?

2634
03:42:33,080 --> 03:42:35,080
Shoot them down!

2635
03:42:35,080 --> 03:42:37,080
That wasn't bad either.

2636
03:42:37,080 --> 03:42:39,080
Oh, back up on the horse!

2637
03:42:40,080 --> 03:42:42,080
You better stop!

2638
03:42:47,080 --> 03:42:49,080
This is, like, Snape or Simulator, honestly.

2639
03:42:49,080 --> 03:42:50,080
Oops!

2640
03:42:50,080 --> 03:42:53,080
Oh no, I'm going to get shot. I messed up.

2641
03:42:55,080 --> 03:42:57,080
Hello?

2642
03:42:57,080 --> 03:42:59,080
They're out the road!

2643
03:43:05,080 --> 03:43:07,080
I actually wanted to perish there.

2644
03:43:07,080 --> 03:43:09,080
He said I like feeling pain.

2645
03:43:11,080 --> 03:43:13,080
Sorry, I'm, like, really focusing.

2646
03:43:13,080 --> 03:43:15,080
I don't have the best aim on analogue.

2647
03:43:15,080 --> 03:43:17,080
So, I'll try it.

2648
03:43:18,080 --> 03:43:21,080
But yeah, this is the first mission.

2649
03:43:21,080 --> 03:43:23,080
It's the easiest out of them all.

2650
03:43:23,080 --> 03:43:25,080
This is still tutorial section stuff,

2651
03:43:25,080 --> 03:43:27,080
because the Leonardo missions are main game.

2652
03:43:27,080 --> 03:43:31,080
So, this is technical tutorial.

2653
03:43:31,080 --> 03:43:33,080
We still go in there.

2654
03:43:37,080 --> 03:43:39,080
I'm trying to remember the axe.

2655
03:43:39,080 --> 03:43:43,080
Maybe axe, which is the order.

2656
03:43:48,080 --> 03:43:50,080
Oh, can I hit the barrel?

2657
03:43:50,080 --> 03:43:52,080
Yeah, I can hit the barrel.

2658
03:43:53,080 --> 03:43:55,080
How many are there?

2659
03:43:55,080 --> 03:43:57,080
Okay, we've almost done the sequence,

2660
03:43:57,080 --> 03:43:59,080
and then we're back into the main game.

2661
03:44:00,080 --> 03:44:03,080
I might get another Kola, actually.

2662
03:44:06,080 --> 03:44:08,080
My voice is feeling it.

2663
03:44:10,080 --> 03:44:15,080
I don't know how to extend the stamina of my voice.

2664
03:44:15,080 --> 03:44:17,080
I'm not really sure.

2665
03:44:17,080 --> 03:44:20,080
Other than, like, be quiet five heads.

2666
03:44:20,080 --> 03:44:23,080
But, like, I want to stream.

2667
03:44:23,080 --> 03:44:24,080
I want to have a good time.

2668
03:44:24,080 --> 03:44:26,080
Like, I have so much lost time to make up for.

2669
03:44:26,080 --> 03:44:28,080
Like, you have no idea.

2670
03:44:29,080 --> 03:44:32,080
I saw you spawn in. I saw that.

2671
03:44:34,080 --> 03:44:36,080
I saw you spawn in.

2672
03:44:38,080 --> 03:44:40,080
Hydration and practice.

2673
03:44:40,080 --> 03:44:43,080
I've been using my voice for years now.

2674
03:44:44,080 --> 03:44:46,080
Just speak smaller words.

2675
03:44:46,080 --> 03:44:48,080
Okay.

2676
03:44:48,080 --> 03:44:50,080
Work is a call center agent.

2677
03:44:50,080 --> 03:44:52,080
Water helps.

2678
03:44:55,080 --> 03:44:57,080
Oh, actually.

2679
03:44:57,080 --> 03:44:59,080
Hopefully none of the girls are in here.

2680
03:44:59,080 --> 03:45:01,080
I want to do a short with them.

2681
03:45:01,080 --> 03:45:05,080
Apparently, girls can't make good weapon sounds.

2682
03:45:05,080 --> 03:45:07,080
Like, I'll make the sound of a gun.

2683
03:45:07,080 --> 03:45:11,080
So I'm going to ask all the girls to record an audio of them making sound of a gun.

2684
03:45:11,080 --> 03:45:13,080
And then I'm going to put it in a short.

2685
03:45:13,080 --> 03:45:15,080
It's just like a goofy, funny-ha-ha thing.

2686
03:45:15,080 --> 03:45:17,080
It's nothing serious.

2687
03:45:17,080 --> 03:45:22,080
I'm going to take a few yards from the location of where I'm supposed to go.

2688
03:45:22,080 --> 03:45:24,080
Are you kidding me?

2689
03:45:24,080 --> 03:45:28,080
So I was going to do a shotgun and see if they come up with, like, pistols.

2690
03:45:28,080 --> 03:45:30,080
Or maybe an AK.

2691
03:45:30,080 --> 03:45:32,080
We've got quite a few levels up.

2692
03:45:32,080 --> 03:45:34,080
We've got level three, which is fantastic.

2693
03:45:34,080 --> 03:45:38,080
We're starting to get a bit more serious with the recruits.

2694
03:45:38,080 --> 03:45:41,080
They're starting to get a bit more, like, they can survive.

2695
03:45:41,080 --> 03:45:45,080
I'm actually going to send them on a bigger mission.

2696
03:45:46,080 --> 03:45:50,080
I'm going to take the level three to go level up someone.

2697
03:45:50,080 --> 03:45:52,080
Can I send them on level twos?

2698
03:45:52,080 --> 03:45:55,080
I'll send them on level twos. It's very unlikely they're going to fail.

2699
03:45:55,080 --> 03:45:58,080
But the level two missions are quite long.

2700
03:46:01,080 --> 03:46:03,080
Wonder who's going to be the best.

2701
03:46:03,080 --> 03:46:08,080
I'm going with the classic shotgun, like, the ch-ch-ch-loser there.

2702
03:46:08,080 --> 03:46:11,080
But I'll be very interested to see what the girls come up with.

2703
03:46:11,080 --> 03:46:13,080
I'm trying to go brrrrr.

2704
03:46:17,080 --> 03:46:27,080
Wow, okay, I guess I will go back to the mercenaries to use the aqueduct there.

2705
03:46:27,080 --> 03:46:29,080
Oh, there's an aqueduct there as well.

2706
03:46:29,080 --> 03:46:31,080
Is that closer? I think so.

2707
03:46:32,080 --> 03:46:35,080
You can roll your R's if you're Scottish.

2708
03:46:36,080 --> 03:46:41,080
I know some languages, like, don't roll their R's.

2709
03:46:44,080 --> 03:46:47,080
I was going to say something and my brain completely blanked.

2710
03:46:47,080 --> 03:46:49,080
I'm now going to pretend otherwise.

2711
03:46:50,080 --> 03:46:53,080
Oh, I'm out of bounds. Hard and moir.

2712
03:46:54,080 --> 03:46:56,080
Can I still get to this aqueduct?

2713
03:46:56,080 --> 03:46:58,080
Not aqueduct, the...

2714
03:46:58,080 --> 03:47:00,080
It's not cistern. What is it?

2715
03:47:00,080 --> 03:47:02,080
Is it a cistern? Cistern access?

2716
03:47:05,080 --> 03:47:09,080
Oh my god, new name for Niji fans just dropped cisterns.

2717
03:47:09,080 --> 03:47:13,080
That's awful. I'm sorry, I shouldn't have said that out loud.

2718
03:47:13,080 --> 03:47:15,080
That's the dumbest thing I've said all day.

2719
03:47:19,080 --> 03:47:21,080
My views do not reflect that, Alveolar.

2720
03:47:21,080 --> 03:47:23,080
My views are my own. I do not reflect the company.

2721
03:47:23,080 --> 03:47:26,080
Thank you. I'm just playing Assassin's Creed, please, the middle.

2722
03:47:29,080 --> 03:47:31,080
What does your 11 kill streak sound like?

2723
03:47:32,080 --> 03:47:36,080
I don't know how to make sounds of knives or weaponry.

2724
03:47:43,080 --> 03:47:45,080
Watch whoever you enjoy.

2725
03:47:45,080 --> 03:47:52,080
Someone sent me a marshmallow and it was a link to someone from an agency.

2726
03:47:52,080 --> 03:47:54,080
I'm not going to name the agency.

2727
03:47:54,080 --> 03:47:56,080
They were like, please save her.

2728
03:47:56,080 --> 03:47:58,080
And I was like...

2729
03:47:59,080 --> 03:48:01,080
What do you want me to do?

2730
03:48:01,080 --> 03:48:04,080
They're locked into a contract.

2731
03:48:05,080 --> 03:48:08,080
We have a non-compete at VLR.

2732
03:48:08,080 --> 03:48:13,080
You can literally jump straight into a VTuber agency once your time's up here, if you're finished.

2733
03:48:13,080 --> 03:48:16,080
But what do you want me to do?

2734
03:48:16,080 --> 03:48:21,080
Seriously, you want me to message the company and be like, hey, can I buy her out?

2735
03:48:22,080 --> 03:48:26,080
Thank you for your faith in me, but what am I supposed to do?

2736
03:48:30,080 --> 03:48:33,080
I mean, sure, I would if I could, but...

2737
03:48:34,080 --> 03:48:38,080
I want everyone to be happy and having a good time while they're streaming, but...

2738
03:48:38,080 --> 03:48:40,080
I can't help everyone.

2739
03:48:42,080 --> 03:48:44,080
Set them free?

2740
03:48:45,080 --> 03:48:48,080
No, that sounds so bad, because it's like...

2741
03:48:48,080 --> 03:48:51,080
It sounds like buying like...

2742
03:48:57,080 --> 03:48:59,080
Hederation check.

2743
03:49:02,080 --> 03:49:04,080
I'm going to do a burp.

2744
03:49:05,080 --> 03:49:08,080
Buy the company, my goodness.

2745
03:49:08,080 --> 03:49:10,080
No chance.

2746
03:49:10,080 --> 03:49:12,080
VTuber Moses?

2747
03:49:13,080 --> 03:49:17,080
That is the funniest thing I think I've been called in a long time.

2748
03:49:17,080 --> 03:49:20,080
VTuber Moses, set them free.

2749
03:49:23,080 --> 03:49:26,080
That's hilarious.

2750
03:49:30,080 --> 03:49:32,080
Hijack the company.

2751
03:49:35,080 --> 03:49:38,080
Let companies cook. You'll see eventually.

2752
03:49:41,080 --> 03:49:43,080
Let my people go.

2753
03:49:47,080 --> 03:49:50,080
Once Cesare arrives, you will never get to him.

2754
03:49:50,080 --> 03:49:53,080
I intend to kill the French general.

2755
03:49:53,080 --> 03:49:56,080
Okay, we're getting assigned our next act.

2756
03:49:56,080 --> 03:49:58,080
The Frenchies.

2757
03:49:59,080 --> 03:50:02,080
Desolé if you're a French fry.

2758
03:50:02,080 --> 03:50:05,080
It's not in personal, mate. Not in personal.

2759
03:50:05,080 --> 03:50:08,080
You know, viva la France and all that.

2760
03:50:08,080 --> 03:50:12,080
And c'est la vie, and what other words do you say in French?

2761
03:50:12,080 --> 03:50:15,080
I will have my thieves as I retain his location.

2762
03:50:22,080 --> 03:50:26,080
I have no recruits to send on a mission, because I've already sent them on the mission.

2763
03:50:31,080 --> 03:50:33,080
Where are you going?

2764
03:50:33,080 --> 03:50:35,080
I am not used to anyone without follow-up.

2765
03:50:38,080 --> 03:50:41,080
I am Swiss, I totally support any French propaganda.

2766
03:50:42,080 --> 03:50:44,080
That's awful.

2767
03:50:51,080 --> 03:50:53,080
Oh, I said it wrong.

2768
03:50:58,080 --> 03:51:00,080
Oh no!

2769
03:51:00,080 --> 03:51:03,080
Oh no, I think I'm going to have to go back to scuff tracking.

2770
03:51:03,080 --> 03:51:06,080
My iPhone is at 20%.

2771
03:51:06,080 --> 03:51:09,080
Scuff tracking, here we go.

2772
03:51:09,080 --> 03:51:13,080
Unless I can get it to balance with the charger in...

2773
03:51:13,080 --> 03:51:16,080
Oh my god, you're hearing everything connect.

2774
03:51:16,080 --> 03:51:19,080
Okay, can I get it to balance?

2775
03:51:22,080 --> 03:51:24,080
We're getting a bit horizontal.

2776
03:51:24,080 --> 03:51:26,080
Right, this is dangerous.

2777
03:51:26,080 --> 03:51:28,080
I'm going to put you in front of my glass.

2778
03:51:28,080 --> 03:51:32,080
And I'm going to wedge you in between my keyboard.

2779
03:51:32,080 --> 03:51:34,080
Okay, this isn't working.

2780
03:51:34,080 --> 03:51:37,080
I'm going to wedge you in between...

2781
03:51:37,080 --> 03:51:39,080
My tea cup.

2782
03:51:39,080 --> 03:51:41,080
Let me just...

2783
03:51:41,080 --> 03:51:43,080
Oh, pardon me.

2784
03:51:45,080 --> 03:51:46,080
Okay.

2785
03:51:46,080 --> 03:51:47,080
Uh-huh.

2786
03:51:47,080 --> 03:51:48,080
Oh yeah?

2787
03:51:48,080 --> 03:51:50,080
Okay, yeah?

2788
03:51:50,080 --> 03:51:52,080
Are you still tracking?

2789
03:51:56,080 --> 03:51:57,080
Hello?

2790
03:51:57,080 --> 03:51:58,080
Yes!

2791
03:51:59,080 --> 03:52:00,080
I get it.

2792
03:52:00,080 --> 03:52:01,080
Okay, what actor are we on?

2793
03:52:01,080 --> 03:52:04,080
The banker or the French one?

2794
03:52:04,080 --> 03:52:06,080
I think we're in the French one.

2795
03:52:06,080 --> 03:52:07,080
What broke?

2796
03:52:07,080 --> 03:52:08,080
I didn't break anything.

2797
03:52:08,080 --> 03:52:10,080
If I ain't broke, don't fix it.

2798
03:52:10,080 --> 03:52:12,080
Right, we're going to see how much...

2799
03:52:14,080 --> 03:52:18,080
We're going to see how much it costs to buy the crossbow.

2800
03:52:18,080 --> 03:52:20,080
$12,800.

2801
03:52:20,080 --> 03:52:22,080
I don't have that.

2802
03:52:24,080 --> 03:52:26,080
I'll look away for a second.

2803
03:52:26,080 --> 03:52:29,080
I'm going to be wedged in between a body part.

2804
03:52:29,080 --> 03:52:31,080
How dare you insinuate?

2805
03:52:31,080 --> 03:52:33,080
Right, what mission are we doing?

2806
03:52:34,080 --> 03:52:36,080
Memory Star up here?

2807
03:52:38,080 --> 03:52:42,080
Is it the banker that we're on?

2808
03:52:42,080 --> 03:52:44,080
I kind of think we may be on the banker mission,

2809
03:52:44,080 --> 03:52:46,080
but I can't really remember.

2810
03:52:46,080 --> 03:52:48,080
And my wife had a baby?

2811
03:52:50,080 --> 03:52:51,080
It's Tony Tern Golem.

2812
03:52:51,080 --> 03:52:52,080
I want to try and do that,

2813
03:52:52,080 --> 03:52:55,080
but I think I would destroy my voice in like 20 minutes.

2814
03:52:55,080 --> 03:52:57,080
We hate it.

2815
03:53:00,080 --> 03:53:02,080
It's ink in the back of my throat.

2816
03:53:02,080 --> 03:53:04,080
It's your ink in the back of my throat.

2817
03:53:07,080 --> 03:53:08,080
We're going to rebuild.

2818
03:53:08,080 --> 03:53:10,080
We built this city.

2819
03:53:11,080 --> 03:53:15,080
We built this city on Florence.

2820
03:53:15,080 --> 03:53:20,080
Because that is the currency.

2821
03:53:24,080 --> 03:53:26,080
Actually, I need to do that audio.

2822
03:53:26,080 --> 03:53:27,080
Keep forgetting.

2823
03:53:27,080 --> 03:53:28,080
Post it.

2824
03:53:28,080 --> 03:53:29,080
I need to make it.

2825
03:53:29,080 --> 03:53:32,080
I think I can probably do it after this stream.

2826
03:53:34,080 --> 03:53:36,080
It's a free audio.

2827
03:53:36,080 --> 03:53:37,080
It's just on the ult.

2828
03:53:41,080 --> 03:53:43,080
I'm golem posing whilst gaming.

2829
03:53:43,080 --> 03:53:46,080
I mean, if you want to get technical.

2830
03:53:47,080 --> 03:53:49,080
Should that be a donors on reward?

2831
03:53:49,080 --> 03:53:50,080
It's just a picture.

2832
03:53:50,080 --> 03:53:53,080
Obviously I'd edit my face out and all that.

2833
03:53:53,080 --> 03:53:56,080
It's just a picture of me like bucking a snake.

2834
03:53:56,080 --> 03:54:01,080
Because that's a normally game on my chair in the golem pose.

2835
03:54:01,080 --> 03:54:04,080
And everyone's like, what is this?

2836
03:54:04,080 --> 03:54:07,080
And I was like, it just means what I'm doing.

2837
03:54:09,080 --> 03:54:11,080
Something the adventurer is.

2838
03:54:14,080 --> 03:54:16,080
They're like, what is this pale creature?

2839
03:54:16,080 --> 03:54:18,080
Oh wait, it clearly is golem.

2840
03:54:18,080 --> 03:54:20,080
No questions asked.

2841
03:54:26,080 --> 03:54:27,080
Oh my, yes please.

2842
03:54:27,080 --> 03:54:35,080
Excuse me, I'm on the mission.

2843
03:54:38,080 --> 03:54:41,080
M.E.'s eyes are currently rolling out of her skull right now.

2844
03:54:43,080 --> 03:54:44,080
How much?

2845
03:54:49,080 --> 03:54:51,080
Oh, I forgot to put what she was saying.

2846
03:54:52,080 --> 03:54:55,080
Yeah, I decided on...

2847
03:54:55,080 --> 03:54:59,080
Strongly clips and strongly...

2848
03:54:59,080 --> 03:55:02,080
R just to be strong R and strong clips.

2849
03:55:02,080 --> 03:55:04,080
Because I couldn't think of anything else.

2850
03:55:04,080 --> 03:55:08,080
Although someone sent a really good suggestion on Marshmallow.

2851
03:55:08,080 --> 03:55:09,080
I might change it.

2852
03:55:09,080 --> 03:55:11,080
I mean, we're super early days.

2853
03:55:11,080 --> 03:55:12,080
Like, I can literally change it.

2854
03:55:12,080 --> 03:55:13,080
I have something else.

2855
03:55:14,080 --> 03:55:15,080
Hey hey, Pipi!

2856
03:55:15,080 --> 03:55:17,080
Excuse me, I'm on a mission.

2857
03:55:17,080 --> 03:55:18,080
Where?

2858
03:55:18,080 --> 03:55:19,080
A mission?

2859
03:55:20,080 --> 03:55:21,080
Oh Lolo?

2860
03:55:22,080 --> 03:55:23,080
Okay, this is the banker.

2861
03:55:24,080 --> 03:55:25,080
This is the banker act.

2862
03:55:29,080 --> 03:55:30,080
Sorry.

2863
03:55:33,080 --> 03:55:35,080
I can't sing and do the golem voice.

2864
03:55:35,080 --> 03:55:36,080
My only wish?

2865
03:55:37,080 --> 03:55:40,080
I sound like Marsh from Homey.

2866
03:55:42,080 --> 03:55:44,080
Oh, I can't sing in the golem voice.

2867
03:55:44,080 --> 03:55:49,080
My only wish to catch a fish so juicy and sweet.

2868
03:55:54,080 --> 03:55:55,080
Homey!

2869
03:55:58,080 --> 03:55:59,080
That's terrible.

2870
03:55:59,080 --> 03:56:01,080
That's awful.

2871
03:56:02,080 --> 03:56:04,080
I think Emi is Kubeko.

2872
03:56:04,080 --> 03:56:09,080
She is, how you say, a tabernac.

2873
03:56:11,080 --> 03:56:13,080
And, yeah.

2874
03:56:14,080 --> 03:56:15,080
She doesn't count.

2875
03:56:16,080 --> 03:56:17,080
She doesn't count as a true Frenchie.

2876
03:56:18,080 --> 03:56:19,080
A true French fry.

2877
03:56:20,080 --> 03:56:22,080
French fries are European Frenchies.

2878
03:56:22,080 --> 03:56:23,080
The Swiss are the Swiss.

2879
03:56:24,080 --> 03:56:25,080
And the Kubekois.

2880
03:56:25,080 --> 03:56:26,080
The Kubek.

2881
03:56:26,080 --> 03:56:27,080
Kubek.

2882
03:56:28,080 --> 03:56:29,080
Kubek.

2883
03:56:32,080 --> 03:56:34,080
Homey is the silo stuff.

2884
03:56:37,080 --> 03:56:41,080
Honestly, her Kubekois is something I've heard before.

2885
03:56:42,080 --> 03:56:44,080
She says she's not very confident.

2886
03:56:44,080 --> 03:56:46,080
But as long as she can form sentences,

2887
03:56:46,080 --> 03:56:47,080
the best I can say is like,

2888
03:56:47,080 --> 03:56:53,080
Je vais, je vais, tu vas, il va, elle va.

2889
03:56:53,080 --> 03:56:56,080
Nous allons, nous allons, il va et elle va.

2890
03:56:56,080 --> 03:56:58,080
I can say, I would like, je voudrais,

2891
03:56:58,080 --> 03:57:03,080
I can say, I, which is, j'arrive.

2892
03:57:04,080 --> 03:57:10,080
I can say, I don't think I know any more

2893
03:57:10,080 --> 03:57:13,080
doing words in French, any more verbs.

2894
03:57:17,080 --> 03:57:19,080
All the French fries are like,

2895
03:57:20,080 --> 03:57:21,080
Okay, here we go.

2896
03:57:22,080 --> 03:57:23,080
I'm back.

2897
03:57:23,080 --> 03:57:24,080
What did I miss?

2898
03:57:24,080 --> 03:57:26,080
We're memeing on the French, like everyone else.

2899
03:57:27,080 --> 03:57:30,080
Voulez-vous coucher avec moi?

2900
03:57:31,080 --> 03:57:32,080
Oh my God, my voice cracked.

2901
03:57:32,080 --> 03:57:33,080
Did you hear that?

2902
03:57:35,080 --> 03:57:36,080
Took years of French.

2903
03:57:36,080 --> 03:57:38,080
I think I can say the colors in French.

2904
03:57:39,080 --> 03:57:42,080
Rouge, rose,

2905
03:57:42,080 --> 03:57:46,080
orange,

2906
03:57:48,080 --> 03:57:49,080
green,

2907
03:57:51,080 --> 03:57:53,080
jolie,

2908
03:57:54,080 --> 03:57:57,080
noir, blanc,

2909
03:57:59,080 --> 03:58:00,080
marron,

2910
03:58:02,080 --> 03:58:03,080
what a French.

2911
03:58:03,080 --> 03:58:05,080
Do you money too, do I?

2912
03:58:05,080 --> 03:58:07,080
I'm looking for chésarés bankers.

2913
03:58:07,080 --> 03:58:08,080
Palais-vous francais?

2914
03:58:08,080 --> 03:58:10,080
Oui, oui, avec les poissons,

2915
03:58:10,080 --> 03:58:12,080
dans les sacs.

2916
03:58:12,080 --> 03:58:14,080
Ouais, what did you just make me say?

2917
03:58:14,080 --> 03:58:16,080
I can like kind of half read French.

2918
03:58:16,080 --> 03:58:17,080
I have no idea what I'm saying,

2919
03:58:17,080 --> 03:58:19,080
but I can kind of read it,

2920
03:58:19,080 --> 03:58:21,080
like with the letters and stuff.

2921
03:58:23,080 --> 03:58:24,080
The French aren't real,

2922
03:58:24,080 --> 03:58:26,080
it's a lie made up by the English.

2923
03:58:28,080 --> 03:58:30,080
Je suis monté, pardon.

2924
03:58:31,080 --> 03:58:32,080
All right, this way.

2925
03:58:36,080 --> 03:58:38,080
You're going to have to protect me, though.

2926
03:58:38,080 --> 03:58:40,080
The guards aren't being very friendly.

2927
03:58:40,080 --> 03:58:41,080
You're going to have to protect me.

2928
03:58:43,080 --> 03:58:44,080
Hello, gentlemen.

2929
03:58:44,080 --> 03:58:46,080
May I please double assassinate you?

2930
03:58:46,080 --> 03:58:48,080
No, double assassinate.

2931
03:58:48,080 --> 03:58:50,080
Oh, don't be detected!

2932
03:58:50,080 --> 03:58:52,080
Don't be detected with the mission,

2933
03:58:52,080 --> 03:58:54,080
and the first thing I do is go up

2934
03:58:54,080 --> 03:58:56,080
and kill some guys.

2935
03:58:56,080 --> 03:58:58,080
I'm not very smart, am I?

2936
03:58:59,080 --> 03:59:00,080
Oh well.

2937
03:59:03,080 --> 03:59:05,080
A little oversight, but...

2938
03:59:06,080 --> 03:59:08,080
It's fine.

2939
03:59:08,080 --> 03:59:10,080
Morning!

2940
03:59:12,080 --> 03:59:14,080
Good morning!

2941
03:59:15,080 --> 03:59:17,080
Good evening!

2942
03:59:17,080 --> 03:59:20,080
I really don't want to send my assassins

2943
03:59:20,080 --> 03:59:22,080
on, like, the Lancers,

2944
03:59:22,080 --> 03:59:24,080
but as long as they kill the right guy first,

2945
03:59:24,080 --> 03:59:26,080
it should be fine.

2946
03:59:28,080 --> 03:59:30,080
Right, sorry, the senator's currently complaining

2947
03:59:30,080 --> 03:59:32,080
about his money issues

2948
03:59:32,080 --> 03:59:34,080
and how he hates the Vorgia.

2949
03:59:34,080 --> 03:59:36,080
I'm talking right over it.

2950
03:59:38,080 --> 03:59:39,080
Oops!

2951
03:59:39,080 --> 03:59:41,080
Well, thank goodness they called,

2952
03:59:41,080 --> 03:59:43,080
came in and in.

2953
03:59:50,080 --> 03:59:51,080
Uh, hello?

2954
03:59:51,080 --> 03:59:52,080
Whoa!

2955
03:59:52,080 --> 03:59:53,080
Yeah, see this?

2956
03:59:53,080 --> 03:59:55,080
The citizens become assassins,

2957
03:59:55,080 --> 03:59:56,080
they get scared.

2958
03:59:56,080 --> 03:59:58,080
Why do you not do double blade?

2959
03:59:58,080 --> 04:00:00,080
I have a double blade.

2960
04:00:00,080 --> 04:00:01,080
I'm pretty sure there's, like,

2961
04:00:01,080 --> 04:00:03,080
stuff to do double blade stuff as well.

2962
04:00:04,080 --> 04:00:06,080
Uh, really appreciate it.

2963
04:00:06,080 --> 04:00:08,080
A few different skills to do here.

2964
04:00:09,080 --> 04:00:12,080
We should probably get rid of some of our noray.

2965
04:00:13,080 --> 04:00:15,080
This is where we start now.

2966
04:00:15,080 --> 04:00:16,080
We're doing 100% tomorrow.

2967
04:00:16,080 --> 04:00:18,080
We're just doing campaign mode right now.

2968
04:00:21,080 --> 04:00:23,080
Wouldn't be good time zone be easier.

2969
04:00:23,080 --> 04:00:24,080
Aha!

2970
04:00:24,080 --> 04:00:26,080
Good time zone, everyone!

2971
04:00:28,080 --> 04:00:30,080
That's awful.

2972
04:00:35,080 --> 04:00:38,080
Uh, we may be able to get a gun.

2973
04:00:38,080 --> 04:00:39,080
Yes!

2974
04:00:39,080 --> 04:00:41,080
No!

2975
04:00:41,080 --> 04:00:44,080
I was gonna sneak by them.

2976
04:00:45,080 --> 04:00:46,080
I like how he's continuing to talk

2977
04:00:46,080 --> 04:00:48,080
whilst being beaten up by a sword.

2978
04:00:50,080 --> 04:00:52,080
Are they not attacking him?

2979
04:00:54,080 --> 04:00:57,080
Assassin recruits, are you so for real right now?

2980
04:00:57,080 --> 04:00:59,080
Can you attack him?

2981
04:00:59,080 --> 04:01:00,080
What's going on?

2982
04:01:00,080 --> 04:01:01,080
Oh my god.

2983
04:01:01,080 --> 04:01:03,080
Oh, they've attracted more it guards.

2984
04:01:07,080 --> 04:01:08,080
What?

2985
04:01:08,080 --> 04:01:10,080
And now someone's grabbing the guard?

2986
04:01:10,080 --> 04:01:11,080
Hello?

2987
04:01:11,080 --> 04:01:12,080
Right, no.

2988
04:01:12,080 --> 04:01:13,080
This isn't my problem.

2989
04:01:13,080 --> 04:01:14,080
Sorry.

2990
04:01:15,080 --> 04:01:18,080
I don't know what is going on over there, but...

2991
04:01:20,080 --> 04:01:23,080
Uh, I don't think they will attack us.

2992
04:01:24,080 --> 04:01:26,080
We're so far away.

2993
04:01:26,080 --> 04:01:28,080
Okay, so the assassins are dealing with them.

2994
04:01:28,080 --> 04:01:30,080
That was, I think the AI was like,

2995
04:01:30,080 --> 04:01:32,080
no idea who to target first,

2996
04:01:32,080 --> 04:01:34,080
so it was just going for like everyone.

2997
04:01:38,080 --> 04:01:40,080
As a Spanish speaker, it should not be that bad.

2998
04:01:40,080 --> 04:01:42,080
I can understand quite a lot of Spanish.

2999
04:01:48,080 --> 04:01:50,080
That's the best I got for Spanish.

3000
04:01:50,080 --> 04:01:52,080
Sorry, but man's not got any Spanish.

3001
04:01:55,080 --> 04:01:57,080
I'm trying to think about this one.

3002
04:02:00,080 --> 04:02:01,080
Puta matvee!

3003
04:02:01,080 --> 04:02:02,080
Oh wait, no, I did wrong.

3004
04:02:02,080 --> 04:02:04,080
Puta matvee!

3005
04:02:06,080 --> 04:02:08,080
That's my Espanol.

3006
04:02:10,080 --> 04:02:11,080
We're going...

3007
04:02:12,080 --> 04:02:14,080
Guards, guards, guards.

3008
04:02:18,080 --> 04:02:19,080
No, a horse.

3009
04:02:19,080 --> 04:02:20,080
Anything but a horse.

3010
04:02:21,080 --> 04:02:23,080
I'm sorry, but you're getting targeted first.

3011
04:02:23,080 --> 04:02:25,080
I don't want any horse problems.

3012
04:02:27,080 --> 04:02:28,080
Oh, the senator's under attack?

3013
04:02:28,080 --> 04:02:30,080
No, they should be attacking me.

3014
04:02:31,080 --> 04:02:32,080
How much health has he got?

3015
04:02:32,080 --> 04:02:35,080
Oh no, he's still like not even lost the square health.

3016
04:02:35,080 --> 04:02:37,080
Oh no, oh no, oh no.

3017
04:02:37,080 --> 04:02:39,080
Assassins help now.

3018
04:02:40,080 --> 04:02:42,080
Okay, we're good, we're good, we're good.

3019
04:02:42,080 --> 04:02:43,080
And someone got promoted.

3020
04:02:44,080 --> 04:02:46,080
Smells like promotion, boys.

3021
04:02:48,080 --> 04:02:49,080
Can I...

3022
04:02:49,080 --> 04:02:51,080
I don't think I can sneak past these guys, so...

3023
04:02:51,080 --> 04:02:53,080
We're just going to go for it, we're just going to send it.

3024
04:02:54,080 --> 04:02:57,080
My assassin recruits just take too long to come back and...

3025
04:02:58,080 --> 04:02:59,080
I'm dumb, so...

3026
04:03:04,080 --> 04:03:06,080
Time to get some sleep, please rest well.

3027
04:03:07,080 --> 04:03:09,080
Sleep well, sweet dreams.

3028
04:03:11,080 --> 04:03:12,080
Do you know other Italian words?

3029
04:03:13,080 --> 04:03:14,080
No.

3030
04:03:14,080 --> 04:03:17,080
Only like Spingy for push, Ayuto for help.

3031
04:03:18,080 --> 04:03:20,080
Katsuo, to swear.

3032
04:03:22,080 --> 04:03:24,080
It's Emmy at piano.

3033
04:03:27,080 --> 04:03:29,080
Aw, it's Emmy at piano?

3034
04:03:29,080 --> 04:03:31,080
She tickled on them ivories.

3035
04:03:31,080 --> 04:03:33,080
Thank goodness I have ivory skin,

3036
04:03:33,080 --> 04:03:35,080
because my goodness, I'm in for a good time.

3037
04:03:38,080 --> 04:03:40,080
They're attacking me, anyways.

3038
04:03:43,080 --> 04:03:47,080
I've not played this game, I've played the game in Dutch once.

3039
04:03:47,080 --> 04:03:50,080
Just so to say follow me in Dutch, you say volg, mate.

3040
04:03:53,080 --> 04:03:55,080
But, yeah, not really.

3041
04:03:55,080 --> 04:03:57,080
It's just subtitles and stuff.

3042
04:04:00,080 --> 04:04:01,080
I knew it.

3043
04:04:07,080 --> 04:04:08,080
Why in Dutch?

3044
04:04:08,080 --> 04:04:11,080
I wanted to learn Dutch at one point, but I gave up.

3045
04:04:13,080 --> 04:04:15,080
I only know Scots in English.

3046
04:04:18,080 --> 04:04:19,080
Family.

3047
04:04:23,080 --> 04:04:26,080
Yeah, Dutch is one of the easiest languages to learn.

3048
04:04:26,080 --> 04:04:28,080
If you're English speaking,

3049
04:04:28,080 --> 04:04:33,080
it only takes apparently like 40 hours to like get the basics to...

3050
04:04:33,080 --> 04:04:35,080
in all that jazz, so...

3051
04:04:36,080 --> 04:04:39,080
20 Florence, that was it.

3052
04:04:39,080 --> 04:04:41,080
In that chest.

3053
04:04:42,080 --> 04:04:44,080
It is a very goofy language,

3054
04:04:44,080 --> 04:04:47,080
but it's so easy to speak and learn.

3055
04:04:48,080 --> 04:04:50,080
So, if you're ever bored and you're like,

3056
04:04:50,080 --> 04:04:52,080
I want to do something,

3057
04:04:52,080 --> 04:04:54,080
just learn some Dutch, learn the animals.

3058
04:04:54,080 --> 04:04:56,080
The animals are quite funny,

3059
04:04:56,080 --> 04:04:59,080
because you can see how literal it is with animals.

3060
04:04:59,080 --> 04:05:01,080
So, Tartel is shieldpoden,

3061
04:05:01,080 --> 04:05:04,080
which literally shielded,

3062
04:05:04,080 --> 04:05:06,080
and then padded.

3063
04:05:06,080 --> 04:05:08,080
Shieldpoden.

3064
04:05:09,080 --> 04:05:11,080
It seems you are ready to die like a gentleman.

3065
04:05:12,080 --> 04:05:15,080
I've got to learn German since my sister moved there.

3066
04:05:15,080 --> 04:05:17,080
Hello, Lloyd, how are you?

3067
04:05:17,080 --> 04:05:19,080
Are you good?

3068
04:05:19,080 --> 04:05:20,080
Is the grass road?

3069
04:05:20,080 --> 04:05:22,080
No, the grass is groin.

3070
04:05:23,080 --> 04:05:25,080
There's some German for you.

3071
04:05:26,080 --> 04:05:29,080
Right, if we don't touch the floor, we get 100%,

3072
04:05:29,080 --> 04:05:31,080
but it's a bit finicky, honestly.

3073
04:05:32,080 --> 04:05:34,080
So, it's not a big deal if we touch the floor.

3074
04:05:35,080 --> 04:05:38,080
Yeah, the grass is groin, yeah.

3075
04:05:40,080 --> 04:05:44,080
Dine and murder is a lovely lady, yeah.

3076
04:05:48,080 --> 04:05:50,080
Sorry, I'm like completely goofing off right now.

3077
04:05:50,080 --> 04:05:52,080
I'm not even explaining the game anymore.

3078
04:05:52,080 --> 04:05:54,080
I'm just having a good time.

3079
04:05:57,080 --> 04:06:00,080
Most English people have difficulty with the ch.

3080
04:06:00,080 --> 04:06:02,080
I assume that's what you wanted me to say.

3081
04:06:02,080 --> 04:06:06,080
Yeah, in Scots to say a lock, which is a lake,

3082
04:06:06,080 --> 04:06:09,080
you say a loch, loch.

3083
04:06:11,080 --> 04:06:13,080
And then we also roll our r's.

3084
04:06:13,080 --> 04:06:17,080
It's not girl, it's girl, girl.

3085
04:06:17,080 --> 04:06:22,080
So, Scots kind of naturally have a buff for other languages,

3086
04:06:22,080 --> 04:06:26,080
which is pretty handy when you're trying to impress someone.

3087
04:06:26,080 --> 04:06:31,080
I think to say, all day every day in...

3088
04:06:34,080 --> 04:06:37,080
All day, took one Taiwan, all day every day in Vietnamese.

3089
04:06:37,080 --> 04:06:39,080
Nah, I don't think that's right.

3090
04:06:39,080 --> 04:06:40,080
Please perish.

3091
04:06:41,080 --> 04:06:43,080
Give me a clap, Papo.

3092
04:06:45,080 --> 04:06:46,080
I'm gonna clap them.

3093
04:06:47,080 --> 04:06:48,080
Sorry.

3094
04:06:50,080 --> 04:06:52,080
Yeah, this is just a classic tailing mission.

3095
04:06:52,080 --> 04:06:55,080
You're not to be out of their POV for 25 seconds.

3096
04:06:56,080 --> 04:06:57,080
We are tailing the banker.

3097
04:06:57,080 --> 04:06:59,080
He currently has our Jussie Jussie money,

3098
04:06:59,080 --> 04:07:02,080
which we do get back at the end of this mission.

3099
04:07:03,080 --> 04:07:06,080
I thought it's he was about to jump on the floor there,

3100
04:07:06,080 --> 04:07:09,080
and I was about to inhale a big inhale.

3101
04:07:12,080 --> 04:07:14,080
Khef me in clap, Papo.

3102
04:07:14,080 --> 04:07:15,080
Me spank me daddy.

3103
04:07:15,080 --> 04:07:16,080
Oh!

3104
04:07:17,080 --> 04:07:19,080
Khef me in clap, Papo.

3105
04:07:19,080 --> 04:07:20,080
There you go.

3106
04:07:21,080 --> 04:07:24,080
To the one Dutch person listening in right now,

3107
04:07:24,080 --> 04:07:27,080
he's having the time of his life.

3108
04:07:27,080 --> 04:07:29,080
He is absolutely on it.

3109
04:07:30,080 --> 04:07:32,080
He's like, I'll see your belief.

3110
04:07:32,080 --> 04:07:33,080
Oh, no, that's please.

3111
04:07:33,080 --> 04:07:34,080
How do you say mercy?

3112
04:07:34,080 --> 04:07:35,080
How do you say thank you?

3113
04:07:35,080 --> 04:07:36,080
Thank you, Bill.

3114
04:07:36,080 --> 04:07:37,080
He's like, oh, thank you, Bill.

3115
04:07:37,080 --> 04:07:38,080
Strawberry.

3116
04:07:38,080 --> 04:07:39,080
Thank you, Bill.

3117
04:07:39,080 --> 04:07:40,080
And his reactant.

3118
04:07:42,080 --> 04:07:43,080
It's me.

3119
04:07:45,080 --> 04:07:46,080
That's it.

3120
04:07:46,080 --> 04:07:49,080
I know like the other stuff, like Iquil.

3121
04:07:49,080 --> 04:07:51,080
It's like I won, like Iquiline.

3122
04:07:51,080 --> 04:07:52,080
Iquiline.

3123
04:07:52,080 --> 04:07:53,080
Go, go, go, go.

3124
04:07:54,080 --> 04:07:57,080
If you are a human, you say Iquiline.

3125
04:07:57,080 --> 04:07:58,080
Go, go, go, go.

3126
04:07:58,080 --> 04:08:02,080
If you are en vrou, Iquil.

3127
04:08:05,080 --> 04:08:07,080
Is he gonna get me in trouble?

3128
04:08:07,080 --> 04:08:08,080
I don't.

3129
04:08:08,080 --> 04:08:12,080
I think I can like kill this guy from the box.

3130
04:08:12,080 --> 04:08:14,080
What's inside the box?

3131
04:08:14,080 --> 04:08:15,080
Nothing.

3132
04:08:15,080 --> 04:08:16,080
I'm stuck.

3133
04:08:16,080 --> 04:08:17,080
Please get out.

3134
04:08:17,080 --> 04:08:18,080
Okay.

3135
04:08:18,080 --> 04:08:20,080
That was funny and unique.

3136
04:08:20,080 --> 04:08:22,080
Please don't do that again.

3137
04:08:22,080 --> 04:08:26,080
I always forget how to navigate this part.

3138
04:08:26,080 --> 04:08:27,080
Are you a fish?

3139
04:08:27,080 --> 04:08:29,080
I'm a cuttlefish.

3140
04:08:29,080 --> 04:08:31,080
I'm a little piece of paper.

3141
04:08:31,080 --> 04:08:34,080
Because I do hypnosis.

3142
04:08:34,080 --> 04:08:37,080
But I've yet to actually make a hypnosis.

3143
04:08:37,080 --> 04:08:39,080
Well, I have a hypnosis audio coming out.

3144
04:08:39,080 --> 04:08:43,080
But like an actual free to view one, like ASMR stuff.

3145
04:08:43,080 --> 04:08:46,080
Oh, can I need to get on that?

3146
04:08:46,080 --> 04:08:49,080
We go cold again, but it sounds terrible.

3147
04:08:49,080 --> 04:08:53,080
I'm kind of glad because I literally have so much ASMR stuff I need to edit.

3148
04:08:53,080 --> 04:08:59,080
And basically I need to wake up and then work before stream.

3149
04:08:59,080 --> 04:09:02,080
Because after stream, I can't do anything.

3150
04:09:02,080 --> 04:09:04,080
I don't want to kill this.

3151
04:09:07,080 --> 04:09:09,080
Someone's up there.

3152
04:09:13,080 --> 04:09:17,080
I really don't want to kill because if you put the bodies on the floor,

3153
04:09:17,080 --> 04:09:21,080
sometimes the bodies desync this.

3154
04:09:21,080 --> 04:09:23,080
Please stop.

3155
04:09:23,080 --> 04:09:26,080
Are you kidding me?

3156
04:09:26,080 --> 04:09:28,080
This thing was don't be detected.

3157
04:09:28,080 --> 04:09:29,080
I messed that up.

3158
04:09:29,080 --> 04:09:30,080
My goodness.

3159
04:09:30,080 --> 04:09:31,080
No, don't fall.

3160
04:09:31,080 --> 04:09:32,080
Okay.

3161
04:09:32,080 --> 04:09:33,080
It's fine.

3162
04:09:33,080 --> 04:09:34,080
The senator's right there.

3163
04:09:34,080 --> 04:09:35,080
The banker's over there.

3164
04:09:35,080 --> 04:09:36,080
Well, failed anyway.

3165
04:09:36,080 --> 04:09:38,080
It doesn't matter if I touch the floor.

3166
04:09:38,080 --> 04:09:39,080
Oh.

3167
04:09:39,080 --> 04:09:40,080
You brought the money.

3168
04:09:40,080 --> 04:09:41,080
Well, well.

3169
04:09:41,080 --> 04:09:42,080
Yeah.

3170
04:09:42,080 --> 04:09:45,080
The banker has a special evening plan.

3171
04:09:45,080 --> 04:09:48,080
I'm either on Twitter or on YouTube, but I've got three ASMR videos.

3172
04:09:48,080 --> 04:09:52,080
I need to come out and be like, thanks for 3,000 subscribers.

3173
04:09:52,080 --> 04:09:53,080
Subscribblers.

3174
04:09:53,080 --> 04:09:55,080
I better not lose sight of that.

3175
04:09:55,080 --> 04:09:56,080
Yeah.

3176
04:09:56,080 --> 04:10:03,080
Basically YouTube, like my stats say that I've been like subscribed to like over 5,000 subscribers.

3177
04:10:03,080 --> 04:10:08,080
But obviously, like, because we've been getting cold, it like keeps going down again.

3178
04:10:08,080 --> 04:10:09,080
And it's like, oh, okay.

3179
04:10:09,080 --> 04:10:10,080
I guess.

3180
04:10:10,080 --> 04:10:12,080
But, oh no, I can't leave.

3181
04:10:12,080 --> 04:10:14,080
Oh, I don't have to leave.

3182
04:10:14,080 --> 04:10:15,080
How do I get up here?

3183
04:10:15,080 --> 04:10:16,080
What are you thinking?

3184
04:10:16,080 --> 04:10:17,080
Where's the law?

3185
04:10:17,080 --> 04:10:18,080
Oh.

3186
04:10:18,080 --> 04:10:19,080
How do I get up here?

3187
04:10:19,080 --> 04:10:20,080
Yeah.

3188
04:10:20,080 --> 04:10:21,080
Oh.

3189
04:10:21,080 --> 04:10:25,080
Well, Vila only stream on YouTube.

3190
04:10:25,080 --> 04:10:27,080
There'll be Twitch streams.

3191
04:10:27,080 --> 04:10:35,320
Um, not really interested in Twitch because of the arbitrary, like, you're fine, but you're

3192
04:10:35,320 --> 04:10:36,320
not fine.

3193
04:10:36,320 --> 04:10:37,320
And yeah.

3194
04:10:37,320 --> 04:10:42,600
Whereas like YouTube, at least it's kind of like there's definitely an open status

3195
04:10:42,600 --> 04:10:43,600
quo with YouTube.

3196
04:10:43,600 --> 04:10:47,600
And that's much easier to, like, freaking sick.

3197
04:10:47,600 --> 04:10:48,600
Ezio.

3198
04:10:48,600 --> 04:10:49,600
Darling.

3199
04:10:49,600 --> 04:10:50,600
Hen.

3200
04:10:50,600 --> 04:10:52,600
You're stressing me out.

3201
04:10:52,600 --> 04:10:53,600
Get up.

3202
04:10:53,600 --> 04:10:54,600
Get it up.

3203
04:10:54,600 --> 04:10:55,600
Don't be nervous.

3204
04:10:55,600 --> 04:10:56,600
One in three men.

3205
04:10:56,600 --> 04:10:57,600
Get it up.

3206
04:10:57,600 --> 04:10:58,600
What do you mean?

3207
04:10:58,600 --> 04:11:02,600
I'm putting more pressure on you to perform.

3208
04:11:02,600 --> 04:11:03,600
Get it up.

3209
04:11:03,600 --> 04:11:07,600
Maybe that would be a really funny audio.

3210
04:11:08,600 --> 04:11:13,600
Like, I'm absolutely desperate and I'm like, get up, get up, get up.

3211
04:11:13,600 --> 04:11:16,600
But I'm feeling that'd be really, maybe for a meme audio.

3212
04:11:16,600 --> 04:11:17,600
I can do that.

3213
04:11:17,600 --> 04:11:20,600
I don't think that'd be a really funny audio.

3214
04:11:20,600 --> 04:11:27,600
I get, like, really aggressive, like, come on.

3215
04:11:27,600 --> 04:11:31,600
I've never been all on some before.

3216
04:11:31,600 --> 04:11:33,600
A lot of people have been.

3217
04:11:33,600 --> 04:11:34,600
Yeah.

3218
04:11:34,600 --> 04:11:37,600
The culling stops once, like, more content comes up.

3219
04:11:37,600 --> 04:11:42,600
So once I finish the stream, YouTube is going to have to admit to itself that I have 8,000

3220
04:11:42,600 --> 04:11:43,600
hours.

3221
04:11:43,600 --> 04:11:44,600
No.

3222
04:11:44,600 --> 04:11:49,600
I have eight hours in Assassin's Creed and, yeah, people were, like, actually interacting

3223
04:11:49,600 --> 04:11:50,600
and stuff on stream.

3224
04:11:50,600 --> 04:11:52,600
So, yeah, YouTube.

3225
04:11:52,600 --> 04:11:54,600
Strongly won.

3226
04:11:54,600 --> 04:11:55,600
YouTube zero.

3227
04:11:55,600 --> 04:11:59,600
And the girls have been absolutely fantastic about the culling as well.

3228
04:11:59,600 --> 04:12:03,600
Like, they have been, I asked them.

3229
04:12:03,600 --> 04:12:06,600
Like, I do not expect the girls to stream every single day.

3230
04:12:06,600 --> 04:12:08,600
I've told them countless times.

3231
04:12:08,600 --> 04:12:11,600
The only reason I can do it is because I have Rotism, your honour.

3232
04:12:11,600 --> 04:12:17,600
But I did ask them, like, hey, for the first week, you're most likely going to have the

3233
04:12:17,600 --> 04:12:18,600
most views.

3234
04:12:18,600 --> 04:12:23,600
Like, you'll kind of, like, the debuff, no, buff from debut.

3235
04:12:23,600 --> 04:12:28,600
And, like, all of them were like, yeah, I'll give it my all.

3236
04:12:28,600 --> 04:12:30,600
Like, I'll stream as much as I can in the first week.

3237
04:12:30,600 --> 04:12:32,600
So freaking thankful and grateful.

3238
04:12:32,600 --> 04:12:38,600
And, like, I really think it will, like, completely help with the culling and all that jazz.

3239
04:12:38,600 --> 04:12:42,600
So this mission is bizarre.

3240
04:12:42,600 --> 04:12:46,600
You basically have to guess the path of where you need to go.

3241
04:12:46,600 --> 04:12:48,600
And, of course, I haven't unlocked the map.

3242
04:12:48,600 --> 04:12:50,600
So I've freaking done it wrong already.

3243
04:12:50,600 --> 04:12:52,600
Is it this way?

3244
04:12:52,600 --> 04:12:54,600
But you're also timed as well.

3245
04:12:54,600 --> 04:12:58,600
And I don't think I can remember off the top of my head.

3246
04:12:58,600 --> 04:13:02,600
I think I have to go up these stairs.

3247
04:13:06,600 --> 04:13:09,600
No, right, I'm going the wrong way.

3248
04:13:09,600 --> 04:13:12,600
So they get, like, suspicious of you if you go the wrong way.

3249
04:13:12,600 --> 04:13:17,600
And it's like, I'm sorry.

3250
04:13:17,600 --> 04:13:21,600
Oh, I know, like, the general idea, but I don't know the right way, 100%.

3251
04:13:21,600 --> 04:13:27,600
I don't even remember going past these portals, honestly.

3252
04:13:27,600 --> 04:13:32,600
I think we go right of the church.

3253
04:13:32,600 --> 04:13:35,600
And there's, like, upstairs, right of the church.

3254
04:13:35,600 --> 04:13:38,600
My brain is telling me.

3255
04:13:38,600 --> 04:13:41,600
Goodness.

3256
04:13:41,600 --> 04:13:44,600
Yes, and then take a left under here, and then the bridge that's up ahead.

3257
04:13:44,600 --> 04:13:46,600
Okay, I think we've already nailed it.

3258
04:13:46,600 --> 04:13:51,600
That is literally how much I've put to scoop.

3259
04:13:51,600 --> 04:13:54,600
The noise keeps putting me off, but, like, I know where I'm going.

3260
04:13:54,600 --> 04:13:57,600
Okay, geez.

3261
04:13:57,600 --> 04:13:59,600
Literally, this is the correct way.

3262
04:13:59,600 --> 04:14:01,600
And the game's like, I was suspicious.

3263
04:14:01,600 --> 04:14:03,600
No, this is the correct way, and I know it is.

3264
04:14:03,600 --> 04:14:06,600
I've played it enough to know this is the right way.

3265
04:14:06,600 --> 04:14:07,600
This is the way.

3266
04:14:07,600 --> 04:14:09,600
Anyone watch Mandalorian?

3267
04:14:09,600 --> 04:14:11,600
Grogo's adorable.

3268
04:14:11,600 --> 04:14:12,600
Grogo.

3269
04:14:12,600 --> 04:14:13,600
See, there we go.

3270
04:14:13,600 --> 04:14:15,600
We did it.

3271
04:14:15,600 --> 04:14:18,600
And yeah, that's all we have to do.

3272
04:14:18,600 --> 04:14:21,600
And we have completed this section.

3273
04:14:21,600 --> 04:14:25,600
None, none, more than an angry scorn.

3274
04:14:25,600 --> 04:14:28,600
Oh, yeah.

3275
04:14:28,600 --> 04:14:31,600
PayPal.

3276
04:14:31,600 --> 04:14:34,600
I don't know what's going on with the PayPal for the business,

3277
04:14:34,600 --> 04:14:36,600
because we literally submitted.

3278
04:14:36,600 --> 04:14:39,600
It has been established for months.

3279
04:14:39,600 --> 04:14:41,600
Like, all the stuff we've established for months.

3280
04:14:41,600 --> 04:14:46,600
I think, unironically, you guys were supporting, like, A.C.

3281
04:14:46,600 --> 04:14:50,600
and me so much that PayPal's like, this is suspicious.

3282
04:14:50,600 --> 04:14:52,600
And then the PayPal's now blocked.

3283
04:14:52,600 --> 04:14:56,600
So thank you for all the support you've shown the girls already.

3284
04:14:56,600 --> 04:14:59,600
You literally got the account suspended.

3285
04:14:59,600 --> 04:15:04,600
You've literally, like, so much support you've suspended

3286
04:15:04,600 --> 04:15:07,600
being able to support the girls' monetary,

3287
04:15:07,600 --> 04:15:11,600
which is hilarious if you think of it.

3288
04:15:11,600 --> 04:15:14,600
Okay, we're just tailing the guards.

3289
04:15:14,600 --> 04:15:16,600
This is the course on mission I was talking about,

3290
04:15:16,600 --> 04:15:18,600
which is necessary to have them.

3291
04:15:18,600 --> 04:15:21,600
And if you avoid the guards as much as possible

3292
04:15:21,600 --> 04:15:23,600
to hold on to the group for as long as possible

3293
04:15:23,600 --> 04:15:26,600
because you have two sets of girls

3294
04:15:26,600 --> 04:15:29,600
that will go out to distract guards.

3295
04:15:29,600 --> 04:15:32,600
But if you get too close to guards and you didn't want to distract,

3296
04:15:32,600 --> 04:15:34,600
they essentially get wasted.

3297
04:15:34,600 --> 04:15:39,600
And it's about me literally suffering from success.

3298
04:15:39,600 --> 04:15:45,600
I think management managed to pay everyone

3299
04:15:45,600 --> 04:15:50,600
for the watch-alongs in time before that happened.

3300
04:15:50,600 --> 04:15:53,600
But I hope so, because there was a lot of money.

3301
04:15:53,600 --> 04:15:55,600
I think, like, the total for sponsors...

3302
04:15:55,600 --> 04:15:58,600
No! We lost a group to that.

3303
04:15:58,600 --> 04:16:01,600
To the PayPal.

3304
04:16:01,600 --> 04:16:06,600
I think the total of, like, sponsorships was, like...

3305
04:16:06,600 --> 04:16:07,600
I don't mind talking about this,

3306
04:16:07,600 --> 04:16:10,600
was, like, roughly in the 5,000 US dollars mark

3307
04:16:10,600 --> 04:16:14,600
for everyone, like, compiled.

3308
04:16:14,600 --> 04:16:17,600
The original budget was, like, 20,000,

3309
04:16:17,600 --> 04:16:22,600
but hardly anyone was replying to the agency.

3310
04:16:22,600 --> 04:16:29,600
So shout out to Umi Plus and shout out to VNU Agency.

3311
04:16:29,600 --> 04:16:33,600
Don't be surprised if you see us collaborating with them.

3312
04:16:33,600 --> 04:16:36,600
They were fantastic and lovely

3313
04:16:36,600 --> 04:16:39,600
and actually gave us the time of day.

3314
04:16:39,600 --> 04:16:41,600
Um...

3315
04:16:41,600 --> 04:16:43,600
Yeah.

3316
04:16:44,600 --> 04:16:47,600
So don't be surprised if you see us working with those girls

3317
04:16:47,600 --> 04:16:50,600
because their agency was kind enough to give us the time of day,

3318
04:16:50,600 --> 04:16:55,600
whereas pretty much everyone else ignored us, so...

3319
04:16:55,600 --> 04:16:57,600
Yeah.

3320
04:17:01,600 --> 04:17:02,600
Happy it went well.

3321
04:17:02,600 --> 04:17:06,600
Yes, the watch-alongs were a complete success.

3322
04:17:06,600 --> 04:17:12,600
Special thank you to everyone who did them and all of that jazz.

3323
04:17:13,600 --> 04:17:16,600
I'm currently listening to flirting in my ear

3324
04:17:16,600 --> 04:17:17,600
because I just heard her say,

3325
04:17:17,600 --> 04:17:21,600
Priest of Confession or something like that.

3326
04:17:21,600 --> 04:17:23,600
Oh, my God.

3327
04:17:23,600 --> 04:17:28,600
What happens if we had a nun design, okay?

3328
04:17:28,600 --> 04:17:32,600
But then she had, like, a real design under it,

3329
04:17:32,600 --> 04:17:34,600
but we promote her as, like, a genuine,

3330
04:17:34,600 --> 04:17:36,600
like, completely covered up nun.

3331
04:17:36,600 --> 04:17:39,600
And, like, the promo artwork is at her voice lines

3332
04:17:39,600 --> 04:17:42,600
or, like, super conservative and everything.

3333
04:17:42,600 --> 04:17:45,600
And then, on debut, she reveals her real design.

3334
04:17:45,600 --> 04:17:47,600
That'd be so cool.

3335
04:17:47,600 --> 04:17:48,600
I'm allowed to say this stuff out loud

3336
04:17:48,600 --> 04:17:50,600
because I don't control the design,

3337
04:17:50,600 --> 04:17:52,600
so I'm allowed to say this stuff.

3338
04:17:52,600 --> 04:17:54,600
Um...

3339
04:17:54,600 --> 04:17:56,600
I've got none to do with it.

3340
04:17:56,600 --> 04:17:57,600
Uh...

3341
04:17:57,600 --> 04:18:00,600
I love having no more responsibilities.

3342
04:18:00,600 --> 04:18:01,600
There's not gonna be a Fond de la Buse

3343
04:18:01,600 --> 04:18:04,600
because I don't have that responsibility anymore.

3344
04:18:04,600 --> 04:18:06,600
Yay!

3345
04:18:06,600 --> 04:18:09,600
But admit it, you love Fond de la Buse.

3346
04:18:16,600 --> 04:18:18,600
I'm allowed to do it.

3347
04:18:24,600 --> 04:18:27,600
Seeing you all to come alive was so fun.

3348
04:18:27,600 --> 04:18:28,600
Did you, like, see in the behind the scenes

3349
04:18:28,600 --> 04:18:31,600
of how we all looked?

3350
04:18:31,600 --> 04:18:35,600
I am very interested in getting a Celtic design.

3351
04:18:35,600 --> 04:18:39,600
Uh, I'm gonna say something controversial, Karen.

3352
04:18:39,600 --> 04:18:43,600
I actually don't, like, have Mbuba on Vichubama Do.

3353
04:18:43,600 --> 04:18:45,600
And not my thing.

3354
04:18:45,600 --> 04:18:47,600
And, like, the cleavage and all that.

3355
04:18:47,600 --> 04:18:50,600
No, not my thing.

3356
04:18:50,600 --> 04:18:54,600
No, he got yo-inged by two of the freaking girls.

3357
04:18:54,600 --> 04:18:55,600
Are you so dumb?

3358
04:18:55,600 --> 04:18:58,600
Why would you do that?

3359
04:18:58,600 --> 04:19:00,600
Grrr.

3360
04:19:00,600 --> 04:19:02,600
V's sucking my fame age is like,

3361
04:19:02,600 --> 04:19:06,600
bruv, it was rough.

3362
04:19:06,600 --> 04:19:07,600
It was rough.

3363
04:19:07,600 --> 04:19:08,600
Development was rough.

3364
04:19:08,600 --> 04:19:09,600
I'm very happy.

3365
04:19:09,600 --> 04:19:11,600
I never have to develop anything ever again.

3366
04:19:11,600 --> 04:19:13,600
Like, it's completely off-handed.

3367
04:19:13,600 --> 04:19:15,600
I no longer have to do anything.

3368
04:19:15,600 --> 04:19:19,600
And it's so, it's such a good feeling.

3369
04:19:19,600 --> 04:19:21,600
Right, we're just gonna hire these courtesans

3370
04:19:21,600 --> 04:19:23,600
to make sure all is good.

3371
04:19:23,600 --> 04:19:27,600
But I think we're, like, pretty safe.

3372
04:19:27,600 --> 04:19:28,600
Make yourself flat.

3373
04:19:28,600 --> 04:19:31,600
Honestly, I might.

3374
04:19:31,600 --> 04:19:35,600
Um, in an alternative costume or something.

3375
04:19:35,600 --> 04:19:36,600
Design.

3376
04:19:36,600 --> 04:19:39,600
Alternative outfit, that's what you say.

3377
04:19:39,600 --> 04:19:40,600
Target is on the move.

3378
04:19:40,600 --> 04:19:45,600
I repeat, tango is on the move.

3379
04:19:45,600 --> 04:19:46,600
Alpha.

3380
04:19:46,600 --> 04:19:47,600
Bravo.

3381
04:19:47,600 --> 04:19:48,600
Charlie.

3382
04:19:48,600 --> 04:19:49,600
Delta.

3383
04:19:49,600 --> 04:19:50,600
Echo.

3384
04:19:50,600 --> 04:19:51,600
Foxtrot.

3385
04:19:51,600 --> 04:19:52,600
Gamma.

3386
04:19:52,600 --> 04:19:53,600
Indigo.

3387
04:19:53,600 --> 04:19:54,600
I don't know if that's alphabet.

3388
04:19:54,600 --> 04:19:55,600
Right, right, right.

3389
04:19:55,600 --> 04:19:57,600
Girls, girls, put your arm down.

3390
04:19:57,600 --> 04:19:59,600
Put your arm down.

3391
04:19:59,600 --> 04:20:01,600
Into the hay bale of we go.

3392
04:20:01,600 --> 04:20:04,600
The hay bale of shame.

3393
04:20:04,600 --> 04:20:05,600
But big plus for you.

3394
04:20:05,600 --> 04:20:08,600
Behind the scenes and the info.

3395
04:20:08,600 --> 04:20:11,600
What better way to celebrate my victims

3396
04:20:11,600 --> 04:20:13,600
than to join in the brotherhood?

3397
04:20:13,600 --> 04:20:17,600
Yeah, like, I'm really, not really bothered for secrets.

3398
04:20:17,600 --> 04:20:18,600
It's like, how do you do this?

3399
04:20:18,600 --> 04:20:20,600
Well, put a lot of money behind it.

3400
04:20:20,600 --> 04:20:21,600
Okay, how do you do that?

3401
04:20:21,600 --> 04:20:23,600
Well, put a lot of money behind it.

3402
04:20:23,600 --> 04:20:25,600
If you ever want to start a VTuber agency,

3403
04:20:25,600 --> 04:20:27,600
I'm gonna say this to you,

3404
04:20:27,600 --> 04:20:30,600
and this is the best advice you will ever get.

3405
04:20:30,600 --> 04:20:32,600
Whatever you think it's gonna cost,

3406
04:20:32,600 --> 04:20:33,600
double it,

3407
04:20:33,600 --> 04:20:35,600
and then give it some more.

3408
04:20:35,600 --> 04:20:37,600
Whatever time you think it's gonna take,

3409
04:20:37,600 --> 04:20:38,600
double it,

3410
04:20:38,600 --> 04:20:41,600
and give it some more.

3411
04:20:41,600 --> 04:20:48,600
I had a lot of issues with, um,

3412
04:20:48,600 --> 04:20:51,600
like, artists going past, like, deadlines.

3413
04:20:51,600 --> 04:20:55,600
So, everything slid back into me,

3414
04:20:55,600 --> 04:20:57,600
and it was horrific for me,

3415
04:20:57,600 --> 04:21:00,600
which is why I don't have a lot of things done.

3416
04:21:00,600 --> 04:21:02,600
Like, my ASMR audios are recorded,

3417
04:21:02,600 --> 04:21:05,600
but they aren't edited for you that go on YouTube.

3418
04:21:05,600 --> 04:21:08,600
And it's a shame because I wanted to have that all done,

3419
04:21:08,600 --> 04:21:10,600
but, you know, things happened and stuff happens,

3420
04:21:10,600 --> 04:21:11,600
and...

3421
04:21:11,600 --> 04:21:13,600
But everything's been fantastic.

3422
04:21:13,600 --> 04:21:15,600
Like, the reception the girls received,

3423
04:21:15,600 --> 04:21:18,600
like, I'm just so glad people are, like, loving on them

3424
04:21:18,600 --> 04:21:20,600
and just so happy with them.

3425
04:21:20,600 --> 04:21:22,600
Like, um,

3426
04:21:22,600 --> 04:21:25,600
it was, like, not easy to have...

3427
04:21:25,600 --> 04:21:26,600
I'm about to get caught,

3428
04:21:26,600 --> 04:21:28,600
because I'm freaking sitting on a wall.

3429
04:21:28,600 --> 04:21:32,600
It was, like, not easy to, like,

3430
04:21:32,600 --> 04:21:34,600
assign people a pre-made model.

3431
04:21:34,600 --> 04:21:36,600
Like, I saw some people, like, ask,

3432
04:21:36,600 --> 04:21:39,600
like, why don't they just create the models themselves

3433
04:21:39,600 --> 04:21:40,600
that they like?

3434
04:21:40,600 --> 04:21:42,600
And it's like, you have...

3435
04:21:42,600 --> 04:21:44,600
I understand that Idol End do that.

3436
04:21:44,600 --> 04:21:47,600
You have no idea how freaking hard it is

3437
04:21:47,600 --> 04:21:49,600
to coordinate, like, X amount of modellers

3438
04:21:49,600 --> 04:21:51,600
to come together, to come make a concept,

3439
04:21:51,600 --> 04:21:52,600
come to this, come to that.

3440
04:21:52,600 --> 04:21:54,600
I am not doing that approach.

3441
04:21:54,600 --> 04:21:57,600
Please do not think the other is going to end up doing that approach.

3442
04:21:57,600 --> 04:21:59,600
However, the girls are more than welcome to...

3443
04:21:59,600 --> 04:22:02,600
Hello? Hello? No, we missed a...

3444
04:22:03,600 --> 04:22:06,600
We missed the opportunity to assassinate them.

3445
04:22:06,600 --> 04:22:07,600
Bruh.

3446
04:22:07,600 --> 04:22:09,600
Come back here right now. My goodness.

3447
04:22:09,600 --> 04:22:11,600
Come back here.

3448
04:22:11,600 --> 04:22:13,600
Oh, right. Well, just do it later.

3449
04:22:13,600 --> 04:22:14,600
Oh, but just...

3450
04:22:14,600 --> 04:22:16,600
Are you supposed to walk right in front of us?

3451
04:22:16,600 --> 04:22:19,600
I think the court is on its path and maybe mess them up.

3452
04:22:19,600 --> 04:22:20,600
Bruh, get right back here.

3453
04:22:21,600 --> 04:22:23,600
But yeah, I am more than happy for the girls

3454
04:22:23,600 --> 04:22:26,600
to tell me what they want for alternative outfits and stuff.

3455
04:22:26,600 --> 04:22:28,600
That's not a problem at all.

3456
04:22:30,600 --> 04:22:35,600
But to do a debut that has input from the start,

3457
04:22:35,600 --> 04:22:40,600
that's like being signed on in development

3458
04:22:40,600 --> 04:22:42,600
is like six months in the making.

3459
04:22:42,600 --> 04:22:45,600
No one wants to be hanging about six months

3460
04:22:45,600 --> 04:22:48,600
waiting for their new job to start.

3461
04:22:48,600 --> 04:22:50,600
Yano?

3462
04:22:50,600 --> 04:22:52,600
Oh, Meru. Hi, Meru.

3463
04:22:52,600 --> 04:22:53,600
How are you doing?

3464
04:22:53,600 --> 04:22:55,600
He has a game.

3465
04:22:56,600 --> 04:22:57,600
Amy's gone live.

3466
04:22:57,600 --> 04:22:58,600
Okay. Amy...

3467
04:22:58,600 --> 04:23:00,600
Oh, whoops, I was in pain and tension.

3468
04:23:00,600 --> 04:23:03,600
Hold on, I'm getting walloped by a frickin' lance.

3469
04:23:03,600 --> 04:23:05,600
Oh, no, the hay bale!

3470
04:23:06,600 --> 04:23:08,600
Oh, my ankles!

3471
04:23:10,600 --> 04:23:12,600
The hay bale! I missed...

3472
04:23:12,600 --> 04:23:14,600
Oh, that's more guards!

3473
04:23:14,600 --> 04:23:16,600
I'm just... I'm hiding in the corner.

3474
04:23:16,600 --> 04:23:18,600
There's so many guards around me.

3475
04:23:24,600 --> 04:23:27,600
Oh, my God! How did they all follow me here?

3476
04:23:27,600 --> 04:23:29,600
All right, I'm calling in the assassins.

3477
04:23:29,600 --> 04:23:30,600
You're stuck.

3478
04:23:31,600 --> 04:23:33,600
Oh, my God.

3479
04:23:33,600 --> 04:23:35,600
There is so many.

3480
04:23:40,600 --> 04:23:42,600
Rip the ankles, I know.

3481
04:23:46,600 --> 04:23:48,600
Funny you come in here, Meru.

3482
04:23:48,600 --> 04:23:50,600
I was just talking about your agency.

3483
04:23:52,600 --> 04:23:54,600
I was seeing how Yumi Plus

3484
04:23:54,600 --> 04:23:57,600
is one of the very few agencies

3485
04:23:57,600 --> 04:24:00,600
that responded to the watch-along offers

3486
04:24:00,600 --> 04:24:02,600
that VLR made.

3487
04:24:02,600 --> 04:24:05,600
Suspicious shout-out to Yumi Plus.

3488
04:24:05,600 --> 04:24:08,600
We love Yumi Plus out here.

3489
04:24:10,600 --> 04:24:12,600
They found us in two seconds.

3490
04:24:12,600 --> 04:24:14,600
Literally, I was pinned against that wall.

3491
04:24:14,600 --> 04:24:17,600
I was like, please don't find me, please don't find me, please don't find me.

3492
04:24:17,600 --> 04:24:19,600
Oh, what? Yeah.

3493
04:24:19,600 --> 04:24:21,600
Hardly.

3494
04:24:21,600 --> 04:24:24,600
We were talking about the watch-along sponsors for VLR's debut.

3495
04:24:24,600 --> 04:24:27,600
And your agency and VNU

3496
04:24:27,600 --> 04:24:29,600
were the only two agencies

3497
04:24:29,600 --> 04:24:31,600
that were kind enough to respond to us.

3498
04:24:31,600 --> 04:24:33,600
Where are Claudia and Maria?

3499
04:24:33,600 --> 04:24:35,600
We just talked with the money.

3500
04:24:35,600 --> 04:24:37,600
They followed us all.

3501
04:24:37,600 --> 04:24:39,600
So, we're trying to go to Amy's room.

3502
04:24:39,600 --> 04:24:41,600
I have good news for you.

3503
04:24:41,600 --> 04:24:43,600
I promote you to go to Amy's room.

3504
04:24:43,600 --> 04:24:46,600
So, if any mods you get,

3505
04:24:46,600 --> 04:24:48,600
one speaking permission,

3506
04:24:48,600 --> 04:24:51,600
Amy's stream link.

3507
04:24:51,600 --> 04:24:54,600
That's your only time you're allowed to talk.

3508
04:24:54,600 --> 04:24:57,600
Whoa, what's going on with the code in there?

3509
04:24:57,600 --> 04:24:59,600
I don't think I've seen that before.

3510
04:24:59,600 --> 04:25:02,600
All those numbers?

3511
04:25:02,600 --> 04:25:04,600
No more talking mods.

3512
04:25:04,600 --> 04:25:06,600
Silence!

3513
04:25:06,600 --> 04:25:08,600
Thank you.

3514
04:25:08,600 --> 04:25:11,600
Please enjoy watching AmyBizu.

3515
04:25:11,600 --> 04:25:14,600
I recommend you watch any of my gen-mates when they go live

3516
04:25:14,600 --> 04:25:18,600
because I myself am an endurance streamer.

3517
04:25:18,600 --> 04:25:22,600
And I will be here for many, many an hour.

3518
04:25:22,600 --> 04:25:25,600
I will be trying to finish the campaign mode of this game.

3519
04:25:25,600 --> 04:25:28,600
So, please do not feel any type of way

3520
04:25:28,600 --> 04:25:30,600
if you go to watch any of my gen-mates.

3521
04:25:30,600 --> 04:25:32,600
I absolutely appreciate it and love it.

3522
04:25:32,600 --> 04:25:36,600
Please always consider liking and scrub-scraping

3523
04:25:36,600 --> 04:25:38,600
to their channels.

3524
04:25:38,600 --> 04:25:42,600
I would love to see them get ahead of me sub-wise

3525
04:25:42,600 --> 04:25:45,600
because the girls are fantastic

3526
04:25:45,600 --> 04:25:49,600
and they have so much potential that I see in them.

3527
04:25:49,600 --> 04:25:51,600
And I just want them to...

3528
04:25:51,600 --> 04:25:53,600
I did not want to take your horse.

3529
04:25:53,600 --> 04:25:56,600
Please get back on your horse and leave me alone.

3530
04:25:56,600 --> 04:25:58,600
I apologize.

3531
04:25:58,600 --> 04:26:02,600
Oh, we're still short of the crossbow.

3532
04:26:02,600 --> 04:26:07,600
Maybe we can make enough money if we send the recruits.

3533
04:26:07,600 --> 04:26:10,600
What kind of need the crossbow for this mission that's coming up?

3534
04:26:10,600 --> 04:26:14,600
If you do not have the crossbow, it is a heck on Earth.

3535
04:26:14,600 --> 04:26:16,600
It's not a fun thing.

3536
04:26:16,600 --> 04:26:18,600
Mercy's laugh is so good.

3537
04:26:18,600 --> 04:26:20,600
You're running the content. You didn't say content too?

3538
04:26:20,600 --> 04:26:22,600
Yeah, tomorrow we do all the side content.

3539
04:26:22,600 --> 04:26:26,600
Today we do campaign mode and go back to 100% stuff.

3540
04:26:26,600 --> 04:26:28,600
Yeah, see, look at that money.

3541
04:26:28,600 --> 04:26:32,600
A thousand florins, thousand, thousand...

3542
04:26:32,600 --> 04:26:35,600
Oh, that's also another Scottish slang for you.

3543
04:26:35,600 --> 04:26:38,600
Sometimes you can drop the T-H and make it an E.

3544
04:26:38,600 --> 04:26:43,600
So the number fair T becomes the number fair T.

3545
04:26:43,600 --> 04:26:45,600
I don't know if you can even hear the difference, but yeah, with an F.

3546
04:26:45,600 --> 04:26:47,600
Very.

3547
04:26:49,600 --> 04:26:54,600
Whoa, we have 15,000? That's like so much money.

3548
04:26:54,600 --> 04:26:56,600
I didn't expect that much, actually.

3549
04:26:56,600 --> 04:27:01,600
I'm going to send the assassins on another contract just to get them more XP.

3550
04:27:01,600 --> 04:27:08,600
Because obviously the higher they are, the more likely they are not to fall in battle.

3551
04:27:08,600 --> 04:27:11,600
I really don't want anyone to fall in battle.

3552
04:27:11,600 --> 04:27:13,600
We should get a level up if they come back soon enough.

3553
04:27:13,600 --> 04:27:14,600
Right.

3554
04:27:14,600 --> 04:27:15,600
Someone say gambling time?

3555
04:27:15,600 --> 04:27:19,600
Wait, why is Amy doing it on her stream for you to say gambling time?

3556
04:27:19,600 --> 04:27:21,600
Is she being a naughty?

3557
04:27:21,600 --> 04:27:23,600
Oh, there's a thief down there.

3558
04:27:23,600 --> 04:27:26,600
Oh, I did gamble with all the money.

3559
04:27:26,600 --> 04:27:28,600
No, we're not gambling with the florins.

3560
04:27:28,600 --> 04:27:30,600
I need it for the crossbow ball.

3561
04:27:30,600 --> 04:27:36,600
And then we're going to go and travel to the barracks.

3562
04:27:36,600 --> 04:27:38,600
Come, will be cheap.

3563
04:27:38,600 --> 04:27:40,600
Crossbow ball.

3564
04:27:40,600 --> 04:27:44,600
Best in slot, which is BIS.

3565
04:27:44,600 --> 04:27:46,600
Best in slot or biz for short.

3566
04:27:46,600 --> 04:27:50,600
Any biz.

3567
04:27:50,600 --> 04:27:54,600
She's doing ASMR.

3568
04:27:54,600 --> 04:27:57,600
Oh, that's why she DM'd me asking about that.

3569
04:27:57,600 --> 04:27:59,600
Okay, yeah.

3570
04:27:59,600 --> 04:28:01,600
It makes sense now.

3571
04:28:01,600 --> 04:28:04,600
You may enjoy Amy's ASMR.

3572
04:28:04,600 --> 04:28:12,600
For no particular reason.

3573
04:28:12,600 --> 04:28:14,600
We gamble.

3574
04:28:14,600 --> 04:28:16,600
It's supposed to be ASMR.

3575
04:28:16,600 --> 04:28:18,600
Yeah, I never should.

3576
04:28:18,600 --> 04:28:20,600
I liked it, like ASMR.

3577
04:28:20,600 --> 04:28:23,600
I should DM and she's like, am I allowed to do ear licking?

3578
04:28:23,600 --> 04:28:24,600
I'm like, you know what?

3579
04:28:24,600 --> 04:28:25,600
Just go for it.

3580
04:28:25,600 --> 04:28:32,600
I said, I told her, don't breathe while you do the licking.

3581
04:28:32,600 --> 04:28:35,600
What does she mean by this?

3582
04:28:35,600 --> 04:28:37,600
I'm not that does not surprise me.

3583
04:28:37,600 --> 04:28:40,600
The French puttane have us under pressure.

3584
04:28:40,600 --> 04:28:42,600
Tell me about their gender.

3585
04:28:42,600 --> 04:28:44,600
Hydration check.

3586
04:28:44,600 --> 04:28:47,600
Chairs are a persuaded King Nui to lend him an entire army.

3587
04:28:47,600 --> 04:28:49,600
But don't let go.

3588
04:28:49,600 --> 04:28:52,600
Gamba to impress or discuss the course.

3589
04:28:52,600 --> 04:28:55,600
I don't have time before I have Valois by the throat.

3590
04:28:55,600 --> 04:28:57,600
We have them in a retreat.

3591
04:28:57,600 --> 04:28:59,600
They seem to be getting closer.

3592
04:28:59,600 --> 04:29:00,600
The situation...

3593
04:29:00,600 --> 04:29:02,600
What does that mean?

3594
04:29:02,600 --> 04:29:04,600
Ear licking.

3595
04:29:04,600 --> 04:29:07,600
Benny, so maybe I could use a little help.

3596
04:29:07,600 --> 04:29:10,600
Yeah.

3597
04:29:10,600 --> 04:29:11,600
Don't take any damage.

3598
04:29:11,600 --> 04:29:12,600
Close it.

3599
04:29:12,600 --> 04:29:15,600
Oh, I should have bought smoke bombs.

3600
04:29:15,600 --> 04:29:17,600
This is bizarre.

3601
04:29:17,600 --> 04:29:21,600
They spawned in so many enemies.

3602
04:29:21,600 --> 04:29:24,600
I get it's supposed to be that you're overrun, but...

3603
04:29:24,600 --> 04:29:26,600
My goodness.

3604
04:29:26,600 --> 04:29:28,600
Hold on.

3605
04:29:31,600 --> 04:29:34,600
You can disengage from fights by just running away and jumping.

3606
04:29:34,600 --> 04:29:37,600
For some reason, jumping makes the AI cry.

3607
04:29:37,600 --> 04:29:40,600
The AI will not swing for you if you jump.

3608
04:29:45,600 --> 04:29:47,600
The other entrance.

3609
04:29:47,600 --> 04:29:49,600
Wait a minute.

3610
04:29:49,600 --> 04:29:54,600
That has a double meaning.

3611
04:29:54,600 --> 04:29:56,600
No, no, refling the other entrance.

3612
04:29:56,600 --> 04:29:58,600
The other one.

3613
04:30:02,600 --> 04:30:03,600
Okay.

3614
04:30:03,600 --> 04:30:06,600
Now we destroy all of the baddies.

3615
04:30:10,600 --> 04:30:15,600
Oh, I do love going on a kill street because it's really satisfying.

3616
04:30:15,600 --> 04:30:17,600
Is that everyone?

3617
04:30:18,600 --> 04:30:21,600
The Baron de Rova, signals from the field.

3618
04:30:21,600 --> 04:30:25,600
Oh, bonjour.

3619
04:30:25,600 --> 04:30:28,600
You can come closer and say that.

3620
04:30:28,600 --> 04:30:29,600
Soon, all of...

3621
04:30:29,600 --> 04:30:32,600
Italy, I will be speaking to.

3622
04:30:32,600 --> 04:30:35,600
Very sensibilities.

3623
04:30:40,600 --> 04:30:43,600
It's so nice of them to wait one by one to attack you.

3624
04:30:43,600 --> 04:30:46,600
I know they have such good manners, honestly.

3625
04:30:48,600 --> 04:30:51,600
Mommy, want to explore that?

3626
04:30:51,600 --> 04:30:55,600
I read the funniest thing ever.

3627
04:30:55,600 --> 04:30:58,600
And if you know, you know.

3628
04:30:58,600 --> 04:31:03,600
It was like, what happens if they take my boy cherry?

3629
04:31:03,600 --> 04:31:07,600
And it was like, story will leave you thinking it's...

3630
04:31:09,600 --> 04:31:11,600
I was cackling, reading that.

3631
04:31:11,600 --> 04:31:13,600
I was like...

3632
04:31:14,600 --> 04:31:16,600
I wish you a lot of fun playing Brotherhood.

3633
04:31:16,600 --> 04:31:19,600
Going to watch the stream later in the day.

3634
04:31:19,600 --> 04:31:21,600
Until all of you have fun watching.

3635
04:31:21,600 --> 04:31:23,600
Good night, rest well, sweet dreams.

3636
04:31:23,600 --> 04:31:25,600
Thanks for hanging in.

3637
04:31:30,600 --> 04:31:31,600
Okay, right.

3638
04:31:31,600 --> 04:31:33,600
Look at the speed of this horse.

3639
04:31:33,600 --> 04:31:37,600
These horses are so much slower.

3640
04:31:37,600 --> 04:31:40,600
What did you mean by that?

3641
04:31:40,600 --> 04:31:42,600
Development team of Brotherhood.

3642
04:31:42,600 --> 04:31:47,600
By making the white horse the slowest and the black horse the fastest.

3643
04:31:47,600 --> 04:31:49,600
What did you mean by that?

3644
04:31:49,600 --> 04:31:50,600
Do you want to elaborate?

3645
04:31:50,600 --> 04:31:51,600
No?

3646
04:31:51,600 --> 04:31:52,600
No?

3647
04:31:52,600 --> 04:31:53,600
Okay.

3648
04:31:54,600 --> 04:31:56,600
Something rather odd.

3649
04:31:56,600 --> 04:31:58,600
Rather odd about that.

3650
04:31:58,600 --> 04:32:01,600
But then again, it could just be coincidence.

3651
04:32:01,600 --> 04:32:06,600
But then, is it coincidence if you go up to like...

3652
04:32:06,600 --> 04:32:11,600
The tan horse is faster than the brown horse is faster than the black ones the fastest.

3653
04:32:18,600 --> 04:32:22,600
Should we be offended by a game that was made 14 years ago?

3654
04:32:22,600 --> 04:32:24,600
So deep!

3655
04:32:24,600 --> 04:32:26,600
It reaches out in the mountains!

3656
04:32:34,600 --> 04:32:36,600
Don't let the game journalists hear me.

3657
04:32:36,600 --> 04:32:37,600
Oh no!

3658
04:32:37,600 --> 04:32:39,600
It's candle to be...

3659
04:32:47,600 --> 04:32:49,600
I miss when they can gallop.

3660
04:32:49,600 --> 04:32:50,600
You can still gallop.

3661
04:32:50,600 --> 04:32:51,600
You have to hold A.

3662
04:32:51,600 --> 04:32:55,600
But the problem with galloping is if there's people in the way your horse will fall over.

3663
04:32:59,600 --> 04:33:01,600
Canceled on first game stream.

3664
04:33:01,600 --> 04:33:05,600
Wait, why would I get cancelled if I point out what the development did?

3665
04:33:05,600 --> 04:33:06,600
Why am I getting...

3666
04:33:06,600 --> 04:33:07,600
Hold on a minute.

3667
04:33:07,600 --> 04:33:08,600
No, no, no.

3668
04:33:08,600 --> 04:33:09,600
You can't cancel me.

3669
04:33:09,600 --> 04:33:11,600
My views do not reflect to be a lawyer agency!

3670
04:33:13,600 --> 04:33:14,600
I just screamed that.

3671
04:33:14,600 --> 04:33:17,600
Right, this is my only gripe.

3672
04:33:17,600 --> 04:33:20,600
This is my only gripe with this mission.

3673
04:33:20,600 --> 04:33:24,600
You get left at the gate here only...

3674
04:33:24,600 --> 04:33:30,600
I repeat, you get left at the gate here only to have to horse your way back to the villa

3675
04:33:30,600 --> 04:33:36,600
when the last mission just got you from the barracks to there.

3676
04:33:36,600 --> 04:33:39,600
So you've literally just gone back to like what you just did.

3677
04:33:39,600 --> 04:33:41,600
That's my only gripe.

3678
04:33:42,600 --> 04:33:43,600
That's right with that.

3679
04:33:43,600 --> 04:33:44,600
On the end.

3680
04:33:45,600 --> 04:33:46,600
Oh, I should do.

3681
04:33:46,600 --> 04:33:47,600
It is smart.

3682
04:33:47,600 --> 04:33:51,600
Like just me going for like 30 minutes ear to ear.

3683
04:33:51,600 --> 04:33:52,600
What was that noise?

3684
04:33:52,600 --> 04:33:53,600
Was that a door?

3685
04:33:53,600 --> 04:33:54,600
I sounded like...

3686
04:33:59,600 --> 04:34:02,600
Once inside, your men can overpower the camp's patrols, correct?

3687
04:34:02,600 --> 04:34:03,600
Yes, but...

3688
04:34:03,600 --> 04:34:06,600
Especially if the patrols are taken completely by surprise.

3689
04:34:06,600 --> 04:34:07,600
Yes.

3690
04:34:09,600 --> 04:34:11,600
My ankle, I'm sitting on it.

3691
04:34:11,600 --> 04:34:12,600
Funny, I can't believe it.

3692
04:34:12,600 --> 04:34:13,600
We are going to walk, right?

3693
04:34:13,600 --> 04:34:15,600
That person grunting?

3694
04:34:15,600 --> 04:34:16,600
Literally, man.

3695
04:34:16,600 --> 04:34:19,600
Cody, you're truly a man after my order.

3696
04:34:19,600 --> 04:34:21,600
I'm going to burp, I'm so sorry.

3697
04:34:22,600 --> 04:34:24,600
Oh, that was a...

3698
04:34:24,600 --> 04:34:25,600
Maybe burp.

3699
04:34:25,600 --> 04:34:27,600
My troops will gather it from the day.

3700
04:34:27,600 --> 04:34:29,600
Should have been a frog V to burp.

3701
04:34:29,600 --> 04:34:31,600
That would have been very good.

3702
04:34:31,600 --> 04:34:34,600
Oh, could have been a hypofrog, honestly.

3703
04:34:35,600 --> 04:34:37,600
Do you ever sit normally?

3704
04:34:38,600 --> 04:34:40,600
I honestly cannot sit in a normal chair.

3705
04:34:40,600 --> 04:34:43,600
Maybe I should do a foot cam, like a thigh cam stream.

3706
04:34:43,600 --> 04:34:47,600
And it's just me showing you how badly I sit, like the entire time.

3707
04:34:47,600 --> 04:34:50,600
I thought a foot cam stream during a horror game would be funny

3708
04:34:50,600 --> 04:34:52,600
because you can watch me shake my ankles.

3709
04:34:52,600 --> 04:34:57,600
And I also have a thing where I press my toes into the ground.

3710
04:34:57,600 --> 04:35:01,600
Like, I literally have like little indents on my toes

3711
04:35:01,600 --> 04:35:03,600
from where I press them into the ground

3712
04:35:03,600 --> 04:35:06,600
because of the way my, like, toes like, form over on it.

3713
04:35:06,600 --> 04:35:09,600
I know it sounds really silly, but, you know...

3714
04:35:10,600 --> 04:35:12,600
Sometimes you don't pick the rotism.

3715
04:35:12,600 --> 04:35:14,600
And the rotism picks you.

3716
04:35:17,600 --> 04:35:18,600
Um...

3717
04:35:18,600 --> 04:35:20,600
And we've got three so far.

3718
04:35:23,600 --> 04:35:24,600
That would actually be funny.

3719
04:35:24,600 --> 04:35:26,600
Okay, I'm down for it.

3720
04:35:26,600 --> 04:35:29,600
Wait, okay, my guy's already gone.

3721
04:35:29,600 --> 04:35:32,600
How about five cents on you?

3722
04:35:33,600 --> 04:35:36,600
I don't want to get caught because we can easily 100% this.

3723
04:35:36,600 --> 04:35:39,600
But the assassin recruits take so long.

3724
04:35:39,600 --> 04:35:41,600
Okay, thankfully they got caught in the...

3725
04:35:41,600 --> 04:35:44,600
Whoa, we're getting action shots, like the horse...

3726
04:35:44,600 --> 04:35:45,600
What? Okay.

3727
04:35:45,600 --> 04:35:46,600
Let them get up.

3728
04:35:46,600 --> 04:35:48,600
Look, look, they're a new recruit.

3729
04:35:48,600 --> 04:35:49,600
Let them get up, let them get up.

3730
04:35:51,600 --> 04:35:54,600
Is the other assassin gonna try and help or...?

3731
04:35:55,600 --> 04:35:56,600
No.

3732
04:35:56,600 --> 04:35:58,600
He's just letting them get absolutely lanced.

3733
04:35:59,600 --> 04:36:01,600
Right, I'll help him out.

3734
04:36:01,600 --> 04:36:03,600
Oh, she's losing health, I don't like that.

3735
04:36:03,600 --> 04:36:05,600
There, right, go kill the other guy now.

3736
04:36:06,600 --> 04:36:08,600
No, I got these...

3737
04:36:08,600 --> 04:36:10,600
I got discovered because of that.

3738
04:36:10,600 --> 04:36:12,600
Okay, whoa, we need to help.

3739
04:36:12,600 --> 04:36:14,600
We need to help, they're too strong.

3740
04:36:14,600 --> 04:36:16,600
This guy's too strong.

3741
04:36:16,600 --> 04:36:19,600
Whoa, whoa, whoa, not the horse, not the horse, not the horse.

3742
04:36:19,600 --> 04:36:22,600
And the boss, and the boss, get him in the boss, hit him in the boss.

3743
04:36:22,600 --> 04:36:24,600
Hit him in the boss, like, don't speak to...

3744
04:36:25,600 --> 04:36:27,600
Okay, okay, okay, okay, horse, it's fine, it's fine.

3745
04:36:27,600 --> 04:36:29,600
I don't know how to go against the horse.

3746
04:36:30,600 --> 04:36:31,600
Please leave me alone.

3747
04:36:32,600 --> 04:36:34,600
I don't know how to deal with horses.

3748
04:36:34,600 --> 04:36:35,600
Okay, there we go.

3749
04:36:35,600 --> 04:36:37,600
Okay, we're dealing with a crossbow ball.

3750
04:36:37,600 --> 04:36:38,600
Jeez.

3751
04:36:40,600 --> 04:36:43,600
Rank 10 assassins are so good, honestly.

3752
04:36:44,600 --> 04:36:47,600
We are very slowly leveling them up.

3753
04:36:48,600 --> 04:36:50,600
I'm wanting to try and pick a fight.

3754
04:36:50,600 --> 04:36:51,600
Can I pick a fight?

3755
04:36:51,600 --> 04:36:52,600
Ooh, feather.

3756
04:36:53,600 --> 04:36:56,600
Look how daintily I jumped over that, that was beautiful.

3757
04:36:56,600 --> 04:36:57,600
Oh, are you stuck?

3758
04:36:57,600 --> 04:36:58,600
Are you okay?

3759
04:36:58,600 --> 04:36:59,600
Have you heard about this?

3760
04:36:59,600 --> 04:37:00,600
Have you heard about this jump?

3761
04:37:00,600 --> 04:37:01,600
Hey, there we go.

3762
04:37:01,600 --> 04:37:03,600
Right, we're going to upset these guys.

3763
04:37:03,600 --> 04:37:05,600
Oh, okay, never mind, okay.

3764
04:37:05,600 --> 04:37:07,600
Wait, that's a barrier?

3765
04:37:08,600 --> 04:37:10,600
That's a barrier.

3766
04:37:10,600 --> 04:37:12,600
Can you jump over them?

3767
04:37:12,600 --> 04:37:14,600
Whoa, I've never seen that before.

3768
04:37:14,600 --> 04:37:16,600
Right, okay, we're going to upset these guards on purpose.

3769
04:37:16,600 --> 04:37:17,600
So we can...

3770
04:37:18,600 --> 04:37:19,600
Ouch!

3771
04:37:19,600 --> 04:37:22,600
I didn't expect that, jeez.

3772
04:37:22,600 --> 04:37:24,600
Oh my goodness.

3773
04:37:24,600 --> 04:37:27,600
I just got double whammy right off the bat.

3774
04:37:27,600 --> 04:37:28,600
Oh my...

3775
04:37:28,600 --> 04:37:29,600
Right, okay.

3776
04:37:29,600 --> 04:37:31,600
I need to take the big guy.

3777
04:37:31,600 --> 04:37:34,600
Thank you, big guy, for perishing.

3778
04:37:34,600 --> 04:37:36,600
Can't handle you.

3779
04:37:36,600 --> 04:37:37,600
Okay, how about that?

3780
04:37:39,600 --> 04:37:40,600
Yeah, big...

3781
04:37:40,600 --> 04:37:41,600
Oh, we need one more.

3782
04:37:41,600 --> 04:37:43,600
Right, who's going to perish?

3783
04:37:43,600 --> 04:37:45,600
You are going to perish.

3784
04:37:47,600 --> 04:37:50,600
Oh, see the horses are getting stuck here.

3785
04:37:50,600 --> 04:37:52,600
I don't know where I'm supposed to go now.

3786
04:37:52,600 --> 04:37:53,600
Oh, I'm good.

3787
04:37:54,600 --> 04:37:56,600
I predict a riot.

3788
04:37:56,600 --> 04:37:58,600
Ooh, do you not want to go down there

3789
04:37:58,600 --> 04:38:00,600
because it's such a nightmare getting out there.

3790
04:38:02,600 --> 04:38:04,600
How many steps is that?

3791
04:38:08,600 --> 04:38:10,600
I don't even think I've done a double kill yet.

3792
04:38:10,600 --> 04:38:12,600
I'm probably going to have to wait till the air stops.

3793
04:38:12,600 --> 04:38:14,600
I'm going to have to go back to the barracks.

3794
04:38:14,600 --> 04:38:16,600
I'm riding a horse and I'm going to go back to the barracks.

3795
04:38:18,600 --> 04:38:20,600
Oh, I'll most likely do a full playthrough

3796
04:38:20,600 --> 04:38:23,600
of Esu's storyline.

3797
04:38:23,600 --> 04:38:25,600
Where am I going?

3798
04:38:26,600 --> 04:38:27,600
Have you seen this?

3799
04:38:30,600 --> 04:38:32,600
Okay, wait, I'm just being deaf.

3800
04:38:33,600 --> 04:38:36,600
Ooh, right, we're going to do this Borgia Tower.

3801
04:38:45,600 --> 04:38:47,600
That's a lot of guards.

3802
04:38:51,600 --> 04:38:54,600
Are we going to hit by Border Patrol?

3803
04:38:56,600 --> 04:38:58,600
We're going to get you.

3804
04:39:00,600 --> 04:39:05,600
And then we're going to just sneak up here and kill you.

3805
04:39:07,600 --> 04:39:10,600
Okay, I'll take that.

3806
04:39:10,600 --> 04:39:12,600
Do you guys need help?

3807
04:39:12,600 --> 04:39:14,600
I'll give you a second recruitment beam

3808
04:39:15,600 --> 04:39:17,600
and let you guys fight it out.

3809
04:39:17,600 --> 04:39:22,600
And I'm going to climb up here and do this.

3810
04:39:22,600 --> 04:39:24,600
Do we skip up here?

3811
04:39:24,600 --> 04:39:26,600
I cannot play Assassin's Creed 1.

3812
04:39:26,600 --> 04:39:27,600
I absolutely suck at it.

3813
04:39:27,600 --> 04:39:28,600
I am so sorry.

3814
04:39:28,600 --> 04:39:30,600
I cannot do it.

3815
04:39:30,600 --> 04:39:32,600
I've tried Beyond Belief.

3816
04:39:32,600 --> 04:39:34,600
I ended up watching someone else play it

3817
04:39:34,600 --> 04:39:36,600
just so I know the storyline.

3818
04:39:36,600 --> 04:39:38,600
Beyond Belief, I'm absolutely trash.

3819
04:39:39,600 --> 04:39:44,600
I probably...

3820
04:39:44,600 --> 04:39:46,600
No, I'm doing variety,

3821
04:39:46,600 --> 04:39:49,600
but what I'll probably do running up to October 10

3822
04:39:49,600 --> 04:39:55,600
is I'll play Assassin's Creed 2 before it,

3823
04:39:55,600 --> 04:39:58,600
then October 10, play Brotherhood again,

3824
04:39:58,600 --> 04:40:01,600
and then after play Revelations,

3825
04:40:01,600 --> 04:40:03,600
and then we'll get the full Ezio story.

3826
04:40:04,600 --> 04:40:09,600
Sometimes it doesn't engage in combat mode,

3827
04:40:09,600 --> 04:40:12,600
and then the enemies get a free hit on you

3828
04:40:12,600 --> 04:40:14,600
because there's nothing you can do.

3829
04:40:14,600 --> 04:40:16,600
I don't know why it does it.

3830
04:40:16,600 --> 04:40:18,600
I mean, I don't know why it does it,

3831
04:40:18,600 --> 04:40:20,600
because stuff and things, but...

3832
04:40:23,600 --> 04:40:25,600
We're level 4.

3833
04:40:25,600 --> 04:40:28,600
We're getting a little bit decent.

3834
04:40:28,600 --> 04:40:29,600
It's not the best.

3835
04:40:29,600 --> 04:40:31,600
We're really not that strong.

3836
04:40:31,600 --> 04:40:33,600
Plumping it all into armor

3837
04:40:33,600 --> 04:40:35,600
because I get so nervous for them.

3838
04:40:36,600 --> 04:40:38,600
I don't want to do a level 4.

3839
04:40:38,600 --> 04:40:40,600
Maybe a 3?

3840
04:40:40,600 --> 04:40:42,600
Send 2 on a level 3

3841
04:40:42,600 --> 04:40:45,600
and split the XP, which is like 100 each.

3842
04:40:45,600 --> 04:40:47,600
Yeah.

3843
04:40:47,600 --> 04:40:48,600
Oh, a second one?

3844
04:40:48,600 --> 04:40:50,600
Okay, we'll do that.

3845
04:40:50,600 --> 04:40:52,600
Okay, that's some all sent to get...

3846
04:40:52,600 --> 04:40:54,600
Oh, my tummy rumbled.

3847
04:40:55,600 --> 04:40:57,600
My tummy rumbled.

3848
04:40:57,600 --> 04:40:59,600
Make me to get some...

3849
04:40:59,600 --> 04:41:00,600
Oh, my tummy rumbled again.

3850
04:41:00,600 --> 04:41:02,600
I don't know if I was getting picked up in the mic,

3851
04:41:02,600 --> 04:41:04,600
but yeah, I think I'm getting a bit peckish

3852
04:41:04,600 --> 04:41:06,600
for, like, actual things.

3853
04:41:06,600 --> 04:41:09,600
You know, sometimes a meat stick doesn't do it.

3854
04:41:09,600 --> 04:41:11,600
Sometimes you need more.

3855
04:41:12,600 --> 04:41:14,600
That...

3856
04:41:14,600 --> 04:41:16,600
There's so many jokes I can make,

3857
04:41:16,600 --> 04:41:17,600
but they're too easy.

3858
04:41:17,600 --> 04:41:18,600
I'm just going to leave it.

3859
04:41:18,600 --> 04:41:20,600
Actually, I'm going to buy smoke bomb pouch if I can.

3860
04:41:22,600 --> 04:41:25,600
It's 9000 Florence!

3861
04:41:25,600 --> 04:41:28,600
Who has 9000 Florence?

3862
04:41:29,600 --> 04:41:31,600
Unreal.

3863
04:41:31,600 --> 04:41:32,600
Unreal Engine.

3864
04:41:32,600 --> 04:41:34,600
Who has 9000 Florence?

3865
04:41:34,600 --> 04:41:35,600
Not me.

3866
04:41:36,600 --> 04:41:38,600
Yeah, two me say.

3867
04:41:38,600 --> 04:41:40,600
You know what they say?

3868
04:41:40,600 --> 04:41:42,600
None in the pink.

3869
04:41:42,600 --> 04:41:44,600
All in the stink.

3870
04:41:47,600 --> 04:41:48,600
Oh, 9000!

3871
04:41:48,600 --> 04:41:50,600
Okay, we're going to get a smoke bomb.

3872
04:41:50,600 --> 04:41:52,600
Excuse-moi, excuse-moi.

3873
04:41:52,600 --> 04:41:54,600
J'ai vu du smoke bomb de pouch.

3874
04:41:54,600 --> 04:41:56,600
Pouch de smoke bomb?

3875
04:41:56,600 --> 04:41:58,600
Smoke bomb de pouch?

3876
04:41:58,600 --> 04:42:00,600
No, not the knife belt.

3877
04:42:00,600 --> 04:42:02,600
Okay, we have smoke bombs, almost.

3878
04:42:02,600 --> 04:42:05,600
We, a viewer, are not serving the talents.

3879
04:42:05,600 --> 04:42:06,600
Okay.

3880
04:42:09,600 --> 04:42:10,600
I can't believe...

3881
04:42:10,600 --> 04:42:14,600
I actually don't get enough of a cut or a split

3882
04:42:14,600 --> 04:42:16,600
that I can't even afford to...

3883
04:42:16,600 --> 04:42:18,600
Oh, there's an assassin recruit down here.

3884
04:42:18,600 --> 04:42:20,600
Yes, I will help you!

3885
04:42:20,600 --> 04:42:22,600
No, let me help you!

3886
04:42:22,600 --> 04:42:23,600
Oh, it's a lady.

3887
04:42:23,600 --> 04:42:25,600
Oh, my lady.

3888
04:42:25,600 --> 04:42:28,600
We actually need to smoke bomb

3889
04:42:28,600 --> 04:42:31,600
because we need to kill people in a smoke bomb.

3890
04:42:32,600 --> 04:42:35,600
For, uh, why...

3891
04:42:35,600 --> 04:42:36,600
What?

3892
04:42:36,600 --> 04:42:39,600
Why do they just get aggressive on us?

3893
04:42:41,600 --> 04:42:43,600
Sometimes you need a group of meat sticks.

3894
04:42:43,600 --> 04:42:44,600
A smart booth.

3895
04:42:44,600 --> 04:42:45,600
Who said that?

3896
04:42:45,600 --> 04:42:47,600
Who said that?

3897
04:42:47,600 --> 04:42:49,600
Maud just put them on a warning.

3898
04:42:49,600 --> 04:42:52,600
Whoever insinuates that the A smart booth

3899
04:42:52,600 --> 04:42:55,600
is going to be utilized for anything but tingling.

3900
04:42:56,600 --> 04:42:58,600
Put them on a warning.

3901
04:42:58,600 --> 04:42:59,600
Don't.

3902
04:42:59,600 --> 04:43:01,600
Teasing.

3903
04:43:03,600 --> 04:43:05,600
I'm teasing.

3904
04:43:05,600 --> 04:43:07,600
I actually think I might need to get...

3905
04:43:07,600 --> 04:43:10,600
I, like, I never noticed that I'm, like, hungry or need to pee,

3906
04:43:10,600 --> 04:43:12,600
and then as soon as I notice it, I'm like,

3907
04:43:12,600 --> 04:43:15,600
ah, I'm perishing, I'm perishing.

3908
04:43:15,600 --> 04:43:18,600
Maud's failed this man's tax return.

3909
04:43:18,600 --> 04:43:20,600
Oh, my God, I cannot wait to...

3910
04:43:20,600 --> 04:43:23,600
I have a funny short coming out about, like,

3911
04:43:23,600 --> 04:43:26,600
what you can get taxed back in a VTuber agency.

3912
04:43:26,600 --> 04:43:29,600
Uh, you know my doughnuts on rewards?

3913
04:43:29,600 --> 04:43:33,600
One of them's going to be a length chart.

3914
04:43:33,600 --> 04:43:36,600
I get to submit that for tax back

3915
04:43:36,600 --> 04:43:40,600
because it's what I needed to do

3916
04:43:40,600 --> 04:43:42,600
in order to operate.

3917
04:43:42,600 --> 04:43:45,600
Like, it's crazy what you can get in tax back.

3918
04:43:45,600 --> 04:43:48,600
Like, obviously it doesn't mean I get the full price of it back in taxes.

3919
04:43:48,600 --> 04:43:51,600
No, it just means, like, the...

3920
04:43:51,600 --> 04:43:55,600
It's like, okay, you can get a few, like, $2 back on your tax return.

3921
04:43:55,600 --> 04:43:56,600
It's like, I think.

3922
04:43:56,600 --> 04:43:58,600
Thanks, appreciate it.

3923
04:43:58,600 --> 04:44:01,600
But, like, yeah, you can get tax back on models,

3924
04:44:01,600 --> 04:44:04,600
get tax back on equipment, get tax back on internet,

3925
04:44:04,600 --> 04:44:07,600
get tax back on, uh, rent as well.

3926
04:44:07,600 --> 04:44:12,600
I get tax back on paying your tax, the stream.

3927
04:44:12,600 --> 04:44:17,600
Oh, I don't even want to think about taxes, honestly.

3928
04:44:17,600 --> 04:44:20,600
Although it was pretty, pretty...

3929
04:44:20,600 --> 04:44:21,600
It reduces what you owe.

3930
04:44:21,600 --> 04:44:24,600
Yes, it doesn't mean I'm going to, like, get the full thing back.

3931
04:44:24,600 --> 04:44:28,600
Sorry, sometimes when people talk about tax back,

3932
04:44:28,600 --> 04:44:32,600
it sounds like they mean you get the full thing back,

3933
04:44:32,600 --> 04:44:34,600
which is not the case at all.

3934
04:44:34,600 --> 04:44:37,600
Everything is a business, right, of, like,

3935
04:44:37,600 --> 04:44:40,600
if you can justify it 100%, like,

3936
04:44:40,600 --> 04:44:43,600
because I can, like, imagine a vealer got audited

3937
04:44:43,600 --> 04:44:45,600
and I have to go, like, oh, yeah, you know,

3938
04:44:45,600 --> 04:44:48,600
this special artwork, um, that was part of the business

3939
04:44:48,600 --> 04:44:51,600
because we're an entertainment business.

3940
04:44:51,600 --> 04:44:54,600
It would be hilarious.

3941
04:44:54,600 --> 04:44:58,600
ASMR Girl IRS agent interrogates you.

3942
04:44:58,600 --> 04:45:00,600
Wait, what am I doing?

3943
04:45:00,600 --> 04:45:02,600
Oh, right in the balls, right?

3944
04:45:02,600 --> 04:45:03,600
Oh!

3945
04:45:03,600 --> 04:45:05,600
Wait, why did...

3946
04:45:05,600 --> 04:45:06,600
Oh!

3947
04:45:06,600 --> 04:45:08,600
Did I just break?

3948
04:45:08,600 --> 04:45:09,600
Oh, my God.

3949
04:45:09,600 --> 04:45:10,600
I'm sorry, I really just...

3950
04:45:10,600 --> 04:45:13,600
Like, the Lance men.

3951
04:45:13,600 --> 04:45:17,600
Small poles only, please, my goodness.

3952
04:45:17,600 --> 04:45:20,600
They're so hard to defeat.

3953
04:45:20,600 --> 04:45:22,600
The company has an account and does everything legally.

3954
04:45:22,600 --> 04:45:23,600
It's by Otonus.

3955
04:45:23,600 --> 04:45:26,600
Okay, dude.

3956
04:45:26,600 --> 04:45:28,600
Management.

3957
04:45:28,600 --> 04:45:32,600
Actually, there's an account and that's true.

3958
04:45:32,600 --> 04:45:36,600
Small poles only, so ogre.

3959
04:45:36,600 --> 04:45:39,600
Wait until he'll tell you about my doctor's visit.

3960
04:45:39,600 --> 04:45:42,600
That's for a later stream.

3961
04:45:42,600 --> 04:45:47,600
You tell it in, like, raw 4K detail about, like, what occurs.

3962
04:45:55,600 --> 04:45:56,600
Right, what am I supposed to do?

3963
04:45:56,600 --> 04:45:58,600
Follow Bartolomeo and his mercenaries.

3964
04:45:58,600 --> 04:45:59,600
Okay.

3965
04:45:59,600 --> 04:46:02,600
Okay, he's about to activate this next thing.

3966
04:46:02,600 --> 04:46:08,600
I am now to perish the guards of my own death gold.

3967
04:46:08,600 --> 04:46:12,600
So this guy can go first.

3968
04:46:12,600 --> 04:46:16,600
And then I can do you.

3969
04:46:16,600 --> 04:46:22,600
And then, last but not least, I can do you.

3970
04:46:22,600 --> 04:46:23,600
No.

3971
04:46:23,600 --> 04:46:26,600
Don't be silly, Ezio.

3972
04:46:26,600 --> 04:46:30,600
Aim on the guard, my goodness.

3973
04:46:30,600 --> 04:46:32,600
By the way, this came...

3974
04:46:32,600 --> 04:46:33,600
What?

3975
04:46:33,600 --> 04:46:36,600
Hello?

3976
04:46:37,600 --> 04:46:39,600
Hello?

3977
04:46:39,600 --> 04:46:43,600
I got desynchronized, but I did what you asked.

3978
04:46:43,600 --> 04:46:48,600
I did everything right and I still lost.

3979
04:46:48,600 --> 04:46:51,600
Wait, this isn't the original checkpoint.

3980
04:46:51,600 --> 04:46:52,600
We still...

3981
04:46:52,600 --> 04:46:59,600
Wait, we hit the checkpoint and it let us go through.

3982
04:46:59,600 --> 04:47:02,600
Okay, okay, okay, I'll take it.

3983
04:47:06,600 --> 04:47:08,600
Okay, next guard checkpoint.

3984
04:47:08,600 --> 04:47:10,600
There's one to our left.

3985
04:47:10,600 --> 04:47:13,600
I might go kill him the new.

3986
04:47:13,600 --> 04:47:15,600
Good day to you.

3987
04:47:15,600 --> 04:47:17,600
Please stop walking.

3988
04:47:17,600 --> 04:47:19,600
Thank you.

3989
04:47:19,600 --> 04:47:23,600
Okay, there's a second guard there.

3990
04:47:23,600 --> 04:47:27,600
I really want to get...

3991
04:47:27,600 --> 04:47:30,600
I need them to split up.

3992
04:47:30,600 --> 04:47:31,600
Focus, focus.

3993
04:47:31,600 --> 04:47:37,600
Focus, there's a pizza on your focus.

3994
04:47:37,600 --> 04:47:39,600
I was too in range.

3995
04:47:39,600 --> 04:47:43,600
If I can time this right, I'm not going to desync.

3996
04:47:43,600 --> 04:47:45,600
I did it.

3997
04:47:45,600 --> 04:47:46,600
Did you see that, though?

3998
04:47:46,600 --> 04:47:47,600
The AI looked at me.

3999
04:47:47,600 --> 04:47:49,600
Oh, my goodness, right?

4000
04:47:49,600 --> 04:47:50,600
What way are you going, Bartolomeo?

4001
04:47:50,600 --> 04:47:52,600
You're going this way.

4002
04:47:52,600 --> 04:47:57,600
That was the way.

4003
04:47:57,600 --> 04:48:00,600
I'm French.

4004
04:48:01,600 --> 04:48:04,600
Freeacak...

4005
04:48:04,600 --> 04:48:06,600
Don't make me sleep!

4006
04:48:06,600 --> 04:48:08,600
I am a French.

4007
04:48:08,600 --> 04:48:11,600
I am a Frenchman.

4008
04:48:11,600 --> 04:48:15,600
I am not Italian or an assassin.

4009
04:48:15,600 --> 04:48:18,600
Ooh, I don't know how...

4010
04:48:18,600 --> 04:48:20,600
But we did get desync to do that.

4011
04:48:21,600 --> 04:48:23,600
We made it which is a funny thing.

4012
04:48:23,600 --> 04:48:26,600
I have a guard right here.

4013
04:48:26,600 --> 04:48:28,600
I don't remember this part.

4014
04:48:28,600 --> 04:48:35,600
All right, you perish. I've got two guards next to each other. I don't like...

4015
04:48:35,600 --> 04:48:40,600
Oh, he's coming this way! Oh, there's a dead body!

4016
04:48:40,600 --> 04:48:44,600
Oh, okay. It's fine.

4017
04:48:44,600 --> 04:48:47,600
Oh, no, he's gone for the dead body!

4018
04:48:47,600 --> 04:48:52,600
I didn't think that through. That was very lucky that we didn't desync all there.

4019
04:48:52,600 --> 04:48:56,600
Phew, we did it. The hard part's over. Now it's for the easy part.

4020
04:48:56,600 --> 04:48:59,600
Where we just walk up to this gate.

4021
04:48:59,600 --> 04:49:07,600
And then we get to learn how French people say Italian dog, which is chien du talien!

4022
04:49:07,600 --> 04:49:13,600
Are you gonna have any European-friendly streams?

4023
04:49:13,600 --> 04:49:20,600
Like, you mean start an earlier than the time I stream right now?

4024
04:49:21,600 --> 04:49:25,600
This is probably going to be my stream start time until...

4025
04:49:25,600 --> 04:49:29,600
Daylight savings kicks in for some places.

4026
04:49:32,600 --> 04:49:34,600
Which part of France are you from?

4027
04:49:34,600 --> 04:49:36,600
Montréal!

4028
04:49:42,600 --> 04:49:44,600
Montréal!

4029
04:49:44,600 --> 04:49:46,600
Open the gate!

4030
04:49:52,600 --> 04:49:54,600
It's E-friendly. It started at 8 p.m.

4031
04:49:54,600 --> 04:49:59,600
It's a bit late if you're, like, German ahead one, or...

4032
04:50:02,600 --> 04:50:06,600
Is this a European-unfriendly stream? Like, do we not like them?

4033
04:50:06,600 --> 04:50:11,600
No, we do. It's just time zones. Like, it's 4 a.m. when I start streaming.

4034
04:50:11,600 --> 04:50:14,600
So, I'm doing my best.

4035
04:50:14,600 --> 04:50:19,600
But I'm an endurance streamer, so I do hit a lot of time zones.

4036
04:50:19,600 --> 04:50:26,600
And it's unlikely, like, reeflings have, like, 8 hours to set, like, through an entire stream.

4037
04:50:26,600 --> 04:50:29,600
Like, maybe if you work from home, or you're listening at work,

4038
04:50:29,600 --> 04:50:32,600
but it's a bit dangerous listening at work, because sometimes I tease a lot.

4039
04:50:32,600 --> 04:50:36,600
Like, especially in ASMR streams, I tease quite a lot.

4040
04:50:36,600 --> 04:50:39,600
This is me just having a really good time.

4041
04:50:39,600 --> 04:50:42,600
So, I'm pretty tame right now, from Brotherhood.

4042
04:50:44,600 --> 04:50:46,600
Repsleepska. Yeah.

4043
04:50:46,600 --> 04:50:48,600
If you live in Turkaya...

4044
04:50:50,600 --> 04:50:53,600
Arkadijim! Arkadijim!

4045
04:50:53,600 --> 04:50:55,600
Means friend.

4046
04:50:55,600 --> 04:50:58,600
And... Turkay.

4047
04:50:59,600 --> 04:51:01,600
I think.

4048
04:51:01,600 --> 04:51:03,600
Enough of your crap.

4049
04:51:03,600 --> 04:51:05,600
Release my wife.

4050
04:51:05,600 --> 04:51:09,600
Such entitlement from a man born with nothing to his name.

4051
04:51:09,600 --> 04:51:12,600
Mine is worth its currency.

4052
04:51:12,600 --> 04:51:16,600
I work from home, and your endurance streams probably end when your work starts.

4053
04:51:16,600 --> 04:51:18,600
So, I'm definitely gonna be...

4054
04:51:18,600 --> 04:51:21,600
How can you focus on working, listening at the same time, though?

4055
04:51:21,600 --> 04:51:25,600
Unless it's, like, background noise. That's different.

4056
04:51:25,600 --> 04:51:30,600
Arkadijim! I learned that from Assassin's Creed Revelations, because it's set in Turkey.

4057
04:51:31,600 --> 04:51:33,600
Never learn.

4058
04:51:40,600 --> 04:51:43,600
These guys are, like, the hardest enemies you can kinda get.

4059
04:51:43,600 --> 04:51:46,600
But if you just jump at them, you can get away with it.

4060
04:51:46,600 --> 04:51:50,600
Well, you just gotta break their stance, and just lick that down.

4061
04:51:50,600 --> 04:51:52,600
And back to me.

4062
04:51:52,600 --> 04:51:55,600
The trick is, I don't really work.

4063
04:51:55,600 --> 04:51:59,600
So, this cutscene is a glitch that was never patched out.

4064
04:51:59,600 --> 04:52:03,600
This is a full edited cutscene, where he, like, go get my wife.

4065
04:52:03,600 --> 04:52:05,600
It never loads. It will never load in time.

4066
04:52:05,600 --> 04:52:07,600
I have no idea what it looks like.

4067
04:52:07,600 --> 04:52:13,600
Well, I assume it looks like him, um, screaming at you, and then he gets his sword and goes offscreen.

4068
04:52:13,600 --> 04:52:16,600
It will never load. It doesn't matter what you do. It never loads.

4069
04:52:16,600 --> 04:52:23,600
Unless, like, maybe someone went into the game data, and, like, I went into free camera, possibly.

4070
04:52:23,600 --> 04:52:25,600
Um...

4071
04:52:25,600 --> 04:52:27,600
Then you could definitely do it.

4072
04:52:27,600 --> 04:52:30,600
I said small poles only!

4073
04:52:32,600 --> 04:52:34,600
We don't want them being p-

4074
04:52:34,600 --> 04:52:36,600
No! You've ruined my speed!

4075
04:52:37,600 --> 04:52:40,600
Okay. We did it, though. It's fine.

4076
04:52:41,600 --> 04:52:43,600
Can I open the gate, please?

4077
04:52:43,600 --> 04:52:45,600
Become anonymous to open the gate?

4078
04:52:45,600 --> 04:52:47,600
There's no one attacking me!

4079
04:52:49,600 --> 04:52:51,600
There's no one attacking me!

4080
04:52:51,600 --> 04:52:54,600
Right, that's what I thought. I was gonna say, there's literally no one attacking me.

4081
04:52:55,600 --> 04:53:00,600
You underwaste my lack of shame. I've listened to some pretty sick stuff at work before.

4082
04:53:03,600 --> 04:53:07,600
Honestly, whatever helps pass the time, like, I'm sorry, but work can be so mundane.

4083
04:53:07,600 --> 04:53:12,600
Like, the best work days are the times where you're super busy, because you blink, and it's the end of the day,

4084
04:53:12,600 --> 04:53:18,600
but you are shattered. That's the only problem. Like, you're absolutely exhausted, and it's really...

4085
04:53:19,600 --> 04:53:26,600
So, you're actually on a timer in this section, and I only have six crossbow bolts, which I do not like at all right now.

4086
04:53:29,600 --> 04:53:33,600
You can. I might mess up the sequence. I do it quite a lot.

4087
04:53:34,600 --> 04:53:36,600
Don't look back. Don't look back. Don't look back!

4088
04:53:43,600 --> 04:53:45,600
Okay, we did it. We did it. We did it. We did it.

4089
04:53:45,600 --> 04:53:47,600
You need to air assassinate him for 100%.

4090
04:53:49,600 --> 04:53:50,600
All done.

4091
04:53:53,600 --> 04:53:55,600
You have no clue how many hours I need to kill in the day.

4092
04:54:01,600 --> 04:54:04,600
Damn, straight respect is earned and not purchased.

4093
04:54:04,600 --> 04:54:05,600
Hmm, hmm.

4094
04:54:10,600 --> 04:54:13,600
Oh, you should probably go to sleep if you need to be up in six hours.

4095
04:54:13,600 --> 04:54:15,600
It's healthy to get eight hours of sleep.

4096
04:54:16,600 --> 04:54:22,600
Digi, no. Men need eight hours of sleep, where women typically need ten hours of sleep.

4097
04:54:23,600 --> 04:54:25,600
But yeah, definitely don't risk your health.

4098
04:54:28,600 --> 04:54:30,600
Sir Shameless, they call me.

4099
04:54:34,600 --> 04:54:37,600
I'll be honest, all your girls make my work day go by real quick.

4100
04:54:37,600 --> 04:54:40,600
It's lovely. Oh, there's some reason to hear.

4101
04:54:42,600 --> 04:54:44,600
AP Gal confirmed Lord.

4102
04:54:57,600 --> 04:55:00,600
Oh my god, VTuber streamer parody of that song. Let's go.

4103
04:55:01,600 --> 04:55:08,600
Okay, then you can collect both of these chests if you're fast enough,

4104
04:55:09,600 --> 04:55:11,600
whilst it's telling you this act is over.

4105
04:55:12,600 --> 04:55:17,600
I swear they purposely did this because no other act takes so long to complete the sequence six,

4106
04:55:17,600 --> 04:55:19,600
like the ending bit to tell you it's over.

4107
04:55:20,600 --> 04:55:22,600
I decided a long time to destroy my sleep schedule.

4108
04:55:23,600 --> 04:55:24,600
That's so legal.

4109
04:55:24,600 --> 04:55:29,600
Forget Paris.

4110
04:55:37,600 --> 04:55:38,600
Worth it feels good.

4111
04:55:41,600 --> 04:55:43,600
Sleep. What is that? I don't need to sleep.

4112
04:55:43,600 --> 04:55:44,600
Oh, she caught me.

4113
04:55:45,600 --> 04:55:49,600
If I can remember this sequence, we may have to...

4114
04:55:50,600 --> 04:55:54,600
Oh, that reminds me, there's actually a thieves challenge,

4115
04:55:54,600 --> 04:55:59,600
which is to dive 200 meters, which you can do off the top of this building.

4116
04:55:59,600 --> 04:56:02,600
So we might as well do it now because we're pretty high up.

4117
04:56:02,600 --> 04:56:03,600
Ready, steady.

4118
04:56:06,600 --> 04:56:09,600
There we go. That's a thieves challenge done right there. Dive complete.

4119
04:56:11,600 --> 04:56:14,600
Oh, I've got a hiring discount on the thieves. Fantastic.

4120
04:56:15,600 --> 04:56:17,600
I... well, enjoy that.

4121
04:56:17,600 --> 04:56:20,600
I need to level them up a bit more before they pickpocket,

4122
04:56:20,600 --> 04:56:22,600
but we're getting close to the point where we don't...

4123
04:56:24,600 --> 04:56:27,600
like Moolah, like that. Where'd any go on the map?

4124
04:56:28,600 --> 04:56:30,600
Where are we? What's our heading?

4125
04:56:31,600 --> 04:56:35,600
Okay, we've liberated that Borgia zone, which is fantastic.

4126
04:56:35,600 --> 04:56:38,600
Where's the mission? Is it south?

4127
04:56:38,600 --> 04:56:41,600
The mission's in the thieves guild,

4128
04:56:41,600 --> 04:56:43,600
which doesn't have a Borgia place on the way,

4129
04:56:43,600 --> 04:56:46,600
but we'll start to try and get all the Borgia towers.

4130
04:56:47,600 --> 04:56:50,600
I'm just going to use the old teleport feature.

4131
04:56:53,600 --> 04:56:54,600
Yeah, yeah.

4132
04:56:54,600 --> 04:56:57,600
And we'll send the assassin recruits on the way to get leveled up a bit more.

4133
04:56:58,600 --> 04:56:59,600
Watching your streams of high level...

4134
04:56:59,600 --> 04:57:00,600
Can you stop that?

4135
04:57:01,600 --> 04:57:02,600
Try and make me blush?

4136
04:57:03,600 --> 04:57:07,600
Like, I'll literally just meme in my butt off playing a really good game.

4137
04:57:08,600 --> 04:57:11,600
Okay, we've got level 5, so we're starting to get a bit...

4138
04:57:11,600 --> 04:57:15,600
I'm going to put it in weapons now just so they have a few more things.

4139
04:57:16,600 --> 04:57:19,600
We need to destroy a tower in order to get our third signal.

4140
04:57:19,600 --> 04:57:22,600
Can I send you guys?

4141
04:57:26,600 --> 04:57:31,600
I'm going to send everyone for the purpose of levelling up that level 1.

4142
04:57:32,600 --> 04:57:35,600
Like, to get them really levelled up from the start.

4143
04:57:35,600 --> 04:57:39,600
So if they do end up in a fight, it's not a problem.

4144
04:57:41,600 --> 04:57:42,600
Is it working? Yes.

4145
04:57:43,600 --> 04:57:46,600
Have you been killing people with your horse?

4146
04:57:47,600 --> 04:57:49,600
Maybe they do.

4147
04:57:50,600 --> 04:57:51,600
No.

4148
04:57:52,600 --> 04:57:54,600
They're not buying it.

4149
04:57:55,600 --> 04:57:58,600
You buy the horse out there.

4150
04:57:59,600 --> 04:58:00,600
He looks like the...

4151
04:58:01,600 --> 04:58:03,600
Oh no, the words aren't working on my head.

4152
04:58:03,600 --> 04:58:07,600
Please don't shoot me and my friend.

4153
04:58:07,600 --> 04:58:10,600
He looks up and he remembers.

4154
04:58:10,600 --> 04:58:12,600
Ooh, I love birds.

4155
04:58:13,600 --> 04:58:17,600
Not at the bird and people die everywhere.

4156
04:58:17,600 --> 04:58:20,600
People die, die, die, die, die, die, die.

4157
04:58:20,600 --> 04:58:24,600
I don't know the words, but like, I know the tune and everything.

4158
04:58:25,600 --> 04:58:26,600
Mmm.

4159
04:58:30,600 --> 04:58:32,600
Strongly means the most important meal of the day.

4160
04:58:40,600 --> 04:58:44,600
We're going to not grab that thief because he's already claimed the wall.

4161
04:58:44,600 --> 04:58:46,600
I never chase thieves.

4162
04:58:46,600 --> 04:58:48,600
If they go up the wall, I cannot be bothered.

4163
04:58:48,600 --> 04:58:50,600
I absolutely cannot be bothered.

4164
04:58:50,600 --> 04:58:54,600
That's probably the only thing in this game that I'm just like, it doesn't matter.

4165
04:58:54,600 --> 04:58:58,600
It's just like if you wanted to poke at the money and whatever item is on their persons.

4166
04:59:01,600 --> 04:59:03,600
What am I doing? What?

4167
04:59:04,600 --> 04:59:05,600
What, do you want to do?

4168
04:59:05,600 --> 04:59:07,600
You guys want to do kegels together?

4169
04:59:08,600 --> 04:59:10,600
Are you ready? Hold for three seconds.

4170
04:59:10,600 --> 04:59:13,600
One, two, three, release.

4171
04:59:14,600 --> 04:59:16,600
You know what, you know what I learned about guys?

4172
04:59:16,600 --> 04:59:17,600
I learned this a while ago.

4173
04:59:17,600 --> 04:59:21,600
If a guy wants to jumpstart his Eiffel Tower,

4174
04:59:21,600 --> 04:59:25,600
he has to close his end, which is crazy.

4175
04:59:25,600 --> 04:59:29,600
A little, a little twitch the, what, twitch it?

4176
04:59:29,600 --> 04:59:31,600
Just so you can, well, twitch it, I guess, yeah.

4177
04:59:32,600 --> 04:59:34,600
Which is crazy lore for guys.

4178
04:59:34,600 --> 04:59:35,600
Absolutely crazy lore.

4179
04:59:37,600 --> 04:59:40,600
Well, I don't know if I was too generic with that.

4180
04:59:40,600 --> 04:59:43,600
In order to achieve sword art.

4181
04:59:43,600 --> 04:59:51,600
Oh, and also when you go with the toilet, you're perlittle.

4182
04:59:51,600 --> 04:59:53,600
I've sent my men out to find him.

4183
04:59:56,600 --> 04:59:57,600
What do we call them?

4184
04:59:58,600 --> 04:59:59,600
You're perlittle.

4185
05:00:02,600 --> 05:00:08,600
I don't know, double eyeballs can touch the toilet and it's super cold and uncomfortable.

4186
05:00:08,600 --> 05:00:12,600
I only learned that super recently because I saw a meme about it.

4187
05:00:12,600 --> 05:00:13,600
And I was like, wait, what?

4188
05:00:14,600 --> 05:00:17,600
You're perlittle guys.

4189
05:00:17,600 --> 05:00:19,600
They're going to retract and save you.

4190
05:00:19,600 --> 05:00:21,600
They get too cold.

4191
05:00:21,600 --> 05:00:24,600
They're going to go straight back up to your belly button.

4192
05:00:24,600 --> 05:00:25,600
No.

4193
05:00:28,600 --> 05:00:29,600
Kill all the attackers.

4194
05:00:29,600 --> 05:00:30,600
Sure, sure, sure.

4195
05:00:36,600 --> 05:00:37,600
Wait, why are we in this?

4196
05:00:37,600 --> 05:00:38,600
Oh, it's a fight.

4197
05:00:38,600 --> 05:00:39,600
It's a fight.

4198
05:00:39,600 --> 05:00:42,600
And I just sent all my assassins away.

4199
05:00:48,600 --> 05:00:49,600
Wrong guy.

4200
05:00:49,600 --> 05:00:50,600
Wrong guy.

4201
05:00:50,600 --> 05:00:52,600
You're hurting the wrong guy, Steve.

4202
05:00:52,600 --> 05:00:54,600
Right, where are the enemies?

4203
05:00:54,600 --> 05:00:57,600
Got an enemy, enemy, enemy, enemy, enemy.

4204
05:00:57,600 --> 05:00:59,600
Enemy, enemy, enemy, enemy.

4205
05:00:59,600 --> 05:01:01,600
Enema, give them an enema.

4206
05:01:04,600 --> 05:01:05,600
Do not give them an enema.

4207
05:01:06,600 --> 05:01:07,600
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

4208
05:01:07,600 --> 05:01:08,600
Whoa.

4209
05:01:08,600 --> 05:01:09,600
That was so cool.

4210
05:01:09,600 --> 05:01:11,600
That attack to double splash over.

4211
05:01:11,600 --> 05:01:12,600
I really enjoyed that.

4212
05:01:24,600 --> 05:01:25,600
Ah, go away.

4213
05:01:26,600 --> 05:01:27,600
They scare me.

4214
05:01:27,600 --> 05:01:29,600
That's a nice, oh, I do have three names.

4215
05:01:29,600 --> 05:01:34,600
Bad boy, bad boy, bad boy, bad boy, bad boy.

4216
05:01:34,600 --> 05:01:35,600
Bad boy.

4217
05:01:35,600 --> 05:01:36,600
Oh, I missed.

4218
05:01:41,600 --> 05:01:43,600
Okay, let's get this big guard.

4219
05:01:43,600 --> 05:01:45,600
Oh, wait, I thought I killed him.

4220
05:01:45,600 --> 05:01:47,600
I wasn't paying attention, I'm sorry.

4221
05:01:47,600 --> 05:01:49,600
I think I'm going to have to get food and refuel in a second

4222
05:01:49,600 --> 05:01:53,600
because I'm starting to get a little bit delirious.

4223
05:01:53,600 --> 05:01:58,600
I'm going to get some egg and I think I'll go ravioli.

4224
05:02:00,600 --> 05:02:02,600
Maybe a wee bit longer, maybe a three.

4225
05:02:02,600 --> 05:02:04,600
Three whole minutes away from stream.

4226
05:02:04,600 --> 05:02:05,600
I cannot believe it.

4227
05:02:05,600 --> 05:02:06,600
I cannot believe it.

4228
05:02:06,600 --> 05:02:08,600
Absolutely unprofessional, unacceptable.

4229
05:02:11,600 --> 05:02:13,600
Oh, damn it, sorry.

4230
05:02:14,600 --> 05:02:17,600
Everybody wants to be in the Assassin's Creed.

4231
05:02:17,600 --> 05:02:21,600
Brotherhood is really, people quite work with the timing of the song.

4232
05:02:21,600 --> 05:02:23,600
She hates us now.

4233
05:02:24,600 --> 05:02:26,600
How long?

4234
05:02:27,600 --> 05:02:28,600
How many hours?

4235
05:02:28,600 --> 05:02:29,600
Five hours?

4236
05:02:29,600 --> 05:02:31,600
Oh, it's been five hours already.

4237
05:02:31,600 --> 05:02:33,600
I've been gushing about this game.

4238
05:02:33,600 --> 05:02:35,600
You know what, reflings?

4239
05:02:35,600 --> 05:02:37,600
Life's good.

4240
05:02:37,600 --> 05:02:39,600
Full stop, life is good.

4241
05:02:40,600 --> 05:02:42,600
Got doing my thing.

4242
05:02:42,600 --> 05:02:44,600
We having a good time mimin' along.

4243
05:02:44,600 --> 05:02:48,600
I'm rambling away about any old shite that passes my brain.

4244
05:02:49,600 --> 05:02:50,600
Life is good.

4245
05:02:52,600 --> 05:02:55,600
We're about to go get some juice.

4246
05:02:55,600 --> 05:02:57,600
I think I'll make a tea.

4247
05:02:57,600 --> 05:02:59,600
Yeah, I'll make a tea.

4248
05:02:59,600 --> 05:03:02,600
You'll get some food, maybe some snacky too.

4249
05:03:03,600 --> 05:03:04,600
I don't think I need to pee.

4250
05:03:04,600 --> 05:03:06,600
No, no pee yet.

4251
05:03:08,600 --> 05:03:10,600
Actually, I should probably gallop, so I'm not that far behind him,

4252
05:03:10,600 --> 05:03:13,600
because he is like so far ahead of me.

4253
05:03:16,600 --> 05:03:17,600
Oh, no!

4254
05:03:17,600 --> 05:03:18,600
My thieves has perished.

4255
05:03:18,600 --> 05:03:20,600
But thieves are ours.

4256
05:03:21,600 --> 05:03:23,600
Yonkers, you're mine now.

4257
05:03:24,600 --> 05:03:26,600
They are, they are...

4258
05:03:27,600 --> 05:03:30,600
Oh, I don't really want to kick them to death.

4259
05:03:30,600 --> 05:03:31,600
Like, make it quick.

4260
05:03:31,600 --> 05:03:33,600
See, oh, don't make them suffer, my goodness.

4261
05:03:34,600 --> 05:03:35,600
It's a bit morbid.

4262
05:03:35,600 --> 05:03:37,600
See, oh, when you do that, I've done that.

4263
05:03:37,600 --> 05:03:39,600
I think I'd rather like make it quick and painless,

4264
05:03:39,600 --> 05:03:40,600
not like drag it out.

4265
05:03:40,600 --> 05:03:41,600
Oh, he got the horse!

4266
05:03:41,600 --> 05:03:43,600
How did he do that?

4267
05:03:44,600 --> 05:03:46,600
I don't know how he did that, but do it again.

4268
05:03:47,600 --> 05:03:49,600
It looked like he did it with some...

4269
05:03:52,600 --> 05:03:54,600
Well, it's 1AM, so I'll take my leave.

4270
05:03:54,600 --> 05:03:55,600
Please, rest well.

4271
05:03:55,600 --> 05:04:00,600
Anyone who does have to rest or to sleepy bye-bye, please don't worry.

4272
05:04:00,600 --> 05:04:01,600
Odds are.

4273
05:04:01,600 --> 05:04:03,600
I'm actually still going to be streaming by the time you wake up.

4274
05:04:03,600 --> 05:04:04,600
I said it.

4275
05:04:05,600 --> 05:04:06,600
Yeah, it's true.

4276
05:04:06,600 --> 05:04:07,600
It's true.

4277
05:04:07,600 --> 05:04:10,600
I might finish the campaign and I might want to do some more.

4278
05:04:10,600 --> 05:04:11,600
It's true.

4279
05:04:11,600 --> 05:04:12,600
It's true.

4280
05:04:12,600 --> 05:04:13,600
The accusations are true.

4281
05:04:14,600 --> 05:04:16,600
So don't worry if you have to go to bed.

4282
05:04:16,600 --> 05:04:17,600
Might see you when you wake up.

4283
05:04:17,600 --> 05:04:18,600
So sweet dreams.

4284
05:04:19,600 --> 05:04:20,600
See you in the morning.

4285
05:04:20,600 --> 05:04:24,600
Jump off wall.

4286
05:04:24,600 --> 05:04:25,600
Get kicked into wall.

4287
05:04:28,600 --> 05:04:30,600
The accusations are true.

4288
05:04:30,600 --> 05:04:31,600
I'm addicted.

4289
05:04:32,600 --> 05:04:34,600
But not as much as I'm addicted to you.

4290
05:04:34,600 --> 05:04:36,600
You guys might have the nicotine patch on your head,

4291
05:04:36,600 --> 05:04:40,600
but the truth is under these bangs or fringe,

4292
05:04:40,600 --> 05:04:42,600
I've got a nicotine patch too,

4293
05:04:42,600 --> 05:04:44,600
and it's covering my entire forehead.

4294
05:04:44,600 --> 05:04:51,600
I wish I didn't send my sassons on that mission.

4295
05:04:51,600 --> 05:04:52,600
Whoa.

4296
05:04:53,600 --> 05:04:54,600
Okay, there we go.

4297
05:04:55,600 --> 05:04:56,600
This is the Roman bath house.

4298
05:04:56,600 --> 05:04:58,600
This is based on reveal, please.

4299
05:05:00,600 --> 05:05:01,600
They are public bath houses.

4300
05:05:03,600 --> 05:05:04,600
Okay, there's a lot going on.

4301
05:05:04,600 --> 05:05:05,600
Hold on, there's a lot going on.

4302
05:05:05,600 --> 05:05:06,600
Hold on.

4303
05:05:06,600 --> 05:05:07,600
Oh, big armor guy.

4304
05:05:07,600 --> 05:05:08,600
Big armor guy.

4305
05:05:08,600 --> 05:05:09,600
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

4306
05:05:09,600 --> 05:05:10,600
Parish.

4307
05:05:11,600 --> 05:05:14,600
My notoriety is going up.

4308
05:05:14,600 --> 05:05:16,600
I like how he just swings that air.

4309
05:05:16,600 --> 05:05:17,600
Whoa.

4310
05:05:17,600 --> 05:05:19,600
Okay, can we get him while he's on the floor?

4311
05:05:19,600 --> 05:05:21,600
Get him on the floor.

4312
05:05:21,600 --> 05:05:22,600
Ow.

4313
05:05:22,600 --> 05:05:24,600
Get him on the floor.

4314
05:05:25,600 --> 05:05:26,600
Lavolpi.

4315
05:05:26,600 --> 05:05:27,600
Lavolpi.

4316
05:05:27,600 --> 05:05:28,600
Old man.

4317
05:05:28,600 --> 05:05:29,600
OG sand.

4318
05:05:29,600 --> 05:05:30,600
Put your Glex on.

4319
05:05:30,600 --> 05:05:32,600
Put your Glex on, OG sand.

4320
05:05:32,600 --> 05:05:34,600
It's me.

4321
05:05:35,600 --> 05:05:38,600
And he is performing in a play in Stanova.

4322
05:05:38,600 --> 05:05:40,600
He played in the first Stanova.

4323
05:05:40,600 --> 05:05:43,600
That was definitely a VA they had used a lot.

4324
05:05:43,600 --> 05:05:45,600
And they were like, please just use any other voice.

4325
05:05:45,600 --> 05:05:47,600
It's going to be so obvious it's you.

4326
05:05:47,600 --> 05:05:51,600
So he had to go stale and play tonight.

4327
05:05:51,600 --> 05:05:53,600
Or a visa game.

4328
05:05:56,600 --> 05:05:57,600
I don't have nicotine.

4329
05:05:57,600 --> 05:05:58,600
I have BLR.

4330
05:05:58,600 --> 05:06:00,600
That's so good.

4331
05:06:00,600 --> 05:06:01,600
Sleep is for the weak.

4332
05:06:01,600 --> 05:06:02,600
I don't know.

4333
05:06:02,600 --> 05:06:03,600
Sleep is very healthy.

4334
05:06:03,600 --> 05:06:06,600
And apparently, if you don't sleep regularly,

4335
05:06:06,600 --> 05:06:09,600
then it's bad for your longevity.

4336
05:06:09,600 --> 05:06:11,600
And you might expire.

4337
05:06:11,600 --> 05:06:15,600
I don't really want you to expire in all honesty.

4338
05:06:15,600 --> 05:06:17,600
I'm going to tell you the truth, chief.

4339
05:06:17,600 --> 05:06:19,600
I'd rather you didn't expire.

4340
05:06:19,600 --> 05:06:22,600
So, please don't.

4341
05:06:23,600 --> 05:06:26,600
We're getting some strawny time, though.

4342
05:06:26,600 --> 05:06:29,600
You're getting strawny time for a very long time every day.

4343
05:06:29,600 --> 05:06:31,600
You could be sick of me.

4344
05:06:31,600 --> 05:06:32,600
Yeah.

4345
05:06:38,600 --> 05:06:40,600
Oh, the music's so good.

4346
05:06:40,600 --> 05:06:42,600
There's also a feather on top of the Colosseum,

4347
05:06:42,600 --> 05:06:44,600
but we can get that at a later time.

4348
05:06:51,600 --> 05:06:53,600
We expire.

4349
05:06:53,600 --> 05:06:55,600
Survive for a moment.

4350
05:06:55,600 --> 05:06:57,600
Not only am I putting you at war,

4351
05:06:57,600 --> 05:06:59,600
I'm now expiring you manually.

4352
05:06:59,600 --> 05:07:01,600
You have been expired.

4353
05:07:02,600 --> 05:07:03,600
Wait, where did he go?

4354
05:07:03,600 --> 05:07:05,600
Oh, I literally glanced away

4355
05:07:05,600 --> 05:07:07,600
and he was perfectly hidden behind Ezio.

4356
05:07:07,600 --> 05:07:09,600
And I was like, oh, where is he?

4357
05:07:10,600 --> 05:07:11,600
All right.

4358
05:07:11,600 --> 05:07:13,600
Enemies, enemies, enemies, enemies.

4359
05:07:13,600 --> 05:07:15,600
Give them an animal.

4360
05:07:15,600 --> 05:07:18,600
Give the enemies an animal for how much?

4361
05:07:19,600 --> 05:07:20,600
What the fuck, you know?

4362
05:07:20,600 --> 05:07:22,600
I'm about, I don't know.

4363
05:07:23,600 --> 05:07:25,600
I'm definitely needing a quick,

4364
05:07:25,600 --> 05:07:27,600
a quick five minute break for you guys.

4365
05:07:27,600 --> 05:07:29,600
We'll just, I'll maybe read some Marshmallows,

4366
05:07:29,600 --> 05:07:31,600
I'm gonna take five minute break,

4367
05:07:31,600 --> 05:07:34,600
and I'll eat and restore my hydration levels and stuff.

4368
05:07:34,600 --> 05:07:36,600
Getting a wee bit delirious.

4369
05:07:36,600 --> 05:07:37,600
Just a wee bit.

4370
05:07:38,600 --> 05:07:40,600
Why is there so many guards this time?

4371
05:07:40,600 --> 05:07:42,600
I don't really recall this game,

4372
05:07:42,600 --> 05:07:44,600
like this part having so many guards.

4373
05:07:45,600 --> 05:07:48,600
Oh, there's a guy on the edge over there.

4374
05:07:50,600 --> 05:07:52,600
Are we all going?

4375
05:07:52,600 --> 05:07:54,600
Okay, he's stuck.

4376
05:07:55,600 --> 05:07:56,600
There, okay, there we go.

4377
05:07:56,600 --> 05:07:58,600
All good, all good in the hood.

4378
05:08:01,600 --> 05:08:03,600
She's got enemies on the brain, Freudian slump.

4379
05:08:03,600 --> 05:08:06,600
And I'm gonna give them, sorry,

4380
05:08:06,600 --> 05:08:08,600
I stuck on my head, it's like a really dumb meme.

4381
05:08:08,600 --> 05:08:10,600
Can I summon Leonardo?

4382
05:08:10,600 --> 05:08:11,600
I can.

4383
05:08:11,600 --> 05:08:12,600
So on these benches,

4384
05:08:12,600 --> 05:08:15,600
is where you can buy more of Leonardo's inventions?

4385
05:08:19,600 --> 05:08:21,600
Is there a thing up there?

4386
05:08:21,600 --> 05:08:23,600
No, it's on the other side.

4387
05:08:25,600 --> 05:08:27,600
Leave me alone.

4388
05:08:35,600 --> 05:08:38,600
What did you ask the scrawny animal marriage when?

4389
05:08:38,600 --> 05:08:41,600
Why are you expecting me to come in the middle of the night?

4390
05:08:41,600 --> 05:08:43,600
Do you think I won?

4391
05:08:47,600 --> 05:08:49,600
I drank a good stretch, yeah.

4392
05:08:49,600 --> 05:08:52,600
Right, we'll finish this sequence

4393
05:08:53,600 --> 05:08:56,600
because I think this is a quick sequence.

4394
05:08:56,600 --> 05:08:58,600
I think we're already like pretty much getting through it.

4395
05:08:58,600 --> 05:09:01,600
We're about to claim the costumes off of enemies.

4396
05:09:02,600 --> 05:09:05,600
Do you think my assassin recruits had finished the mission?

4397
05:09:11,600 --> 05:09:15,600
So, Lavalpe is now convinced Marquio Valley is a thief.

4398
05:09:15,600 --> 05:09:17,600
It is a traitor

4399
05:09:17,600 --> 05:09:20,600
because the events are synchronized

4400
05:09:20,600 --> 05:09:22,600
and not too much.

4401
05:09:22,600 --> 05:09:24,600
Cesare leaves the castle

4402
05:09:24,600 --> 05:09:26,600
when he could have got tipped off.

4403
05:09:26,600 --> 05:09:29,600
Marquio Valley uses guards

4404
05:09:29,600 --> 05:09:32,600
to tell him secrets of the Borgia

4405
05:09:32,600 --> 05:09:36,600
and Lavalpe finds it just far too suspicious

4406
05:09:36,600 --> 05:09:39,600
and he's basically telling us

4407
05:09:39,600 --> 05:09:44,600
if you do not put an end to Lavalpe,

4408
05:09:44,600 --> 05:09:48,600
to Marquio Valley, I'll do it myself.

4409
05:09:50,600 --> 05:09:53,600
Which is scary biscuits and scary beans.

4410
05:09:53,600 --> 05:09:56,600
I'll leave the toes out of the blanket for you.

4411
05:09:56,600 --> 05:09:58,600
Oh my God, did you hear my voice there?

4412
05:09:58,600 --> 05:09:59,600
For you.

4413
05:09:59,600 --> 05:10:00,600
For you.

4414
05:10:00,600 --> 05:10:01,600
For you.

4415
05:10:01,600 --> 05:10:04,600
Would you still love me if I sounded like you?

4416
05:10:08,600 --> 05:10:10,600
I'm wrecking and decking.

4417
05:10:10,600 --> 05:10:12,600
We're on sequence six.

4418
05:10:12,600 --> 05:10:16,600
Act six and there's nine acts together.

4419
05:10:16,600 --> 05:10:19,600
Yes, I right you would.

4420
05:10:20,600 --> 05:10:22,600
I am still your servant and ally.

4421
05:10:22,600 --> 05:10:23,600
Which was an accident.

4422
05:10:23,600 --> 05:10:25,600
Are you demanding that I discount your actions

4423
05:10:25,600 --> 05:10:27,600
and rely on friendship?

4424
05:10:27,600 --> 05:10:29,600
I am asking, not demanding,

4425
05:10:29,600 --> 05:10:31,600
to unite Italia,

4426
05:10:31,600 --> 05:10:33,600
I must have every institute

4427
05:10:33,600 --> 05:10:38,600
and if the church does not fall in love,

4428
05:10:38,600 --> 05:10:41,600
I will eliminate it entirely.

4429
05:10:41,600 --> 05:10:43,600
You know that I really work for you,

4430
05:10:43,600 --> 05:10:44,600
not the folk.

4431
05:10:44,600 --> 05:10:45,600
I can't believe it.

4432
05:10:45,600 --> 05:10:47,600
You said I'm getting rid of Catholicism.

4433
05:10:48,600 --> 05:10:52,600
There's only one way I can know that unconditionally now.

4434
05:10:52,600 --> 05:10:54,600
You intend to kill me.

4435
05:10:54,600 --> 05:10:55,600
You're most loyal friend.

4436
05:10:55,600 --> 05:10:57,600
I have friends that try to tell me that Assassin's Creed.

4437
05:10:57,600 --> 05:10:58,600
Are you letting me go?

4438
05:10:58,600 --> 05:11:01,600
This Assassin's Creed Brotherhood isn't a good game.

4439
05:11:01,600 --> 05:11:02,600
You will not regret it.

4440
05:11:02,600 --> 05:11:04,600
There's so many cool mechanics in Brotherhood,

4441
05:11:04,600 --> 05:11:06,600
wish they didn't steal the DLC though.

4442
05:11:06,600 --> 05:11:09,600
God, give me the costumes for the play.

4443
05:11:09,600 --> 05:11:12,600
It's a shame DLC was really the hype.

4444
05:11:12,600 --> 05:11:14,600
No one else shall have her.

4445
05:11:14,600 --> 05:11:16,600
Make doubly sure it's done correctly.

4446
05:11:16,600 --> 05:11:19,600
He said no one else is allowed to look at it.

4447
05:11:19,600 --> 05:11:21,600
I obey?

4448
05:11:21,600 --> 05:11:24,600
Ooh, that's what we should say to Sheebie.

4449
05:11:24,600 --> 05:11:25,600
We obey.

4450
05:11:25,600 --> 05:11:27,600
We obey.

4451
05:11:27,600 --> 05:11:31,600
We obey Sheebie please.

4452
05:11:31,600 --> 05:11:34,600
Okay, now this horse constantly gets turned around

4453
05:11:34,600 --> 05:11:38,600
so you really can't be too close to him at all.

4454
05:11:38,600 --> 05:11:39,600
We obey Sheebie.

4455
05:11:39,600 --> 05:11:40,600
We obey.

4456
05:11:40,600 --> 05:11:41,600
We do not question.

4457
05:11:41,600 --> 05:11:42,600
We obey.

4458
05:11:46,600 --> 05:11:48,600
Just taking our time with this guy

4459
05:11:48,600 --> 05:11:50,600
because he's so...

4460
05:11:50,600 --> 05:11:53,600
He spins around so easily

4461
05:11:53,600 --> 05:11:55,600
and you can desync so quick.

4462
05:11:59,600 --> 05:12:01,600
Taking our time.

4463
05:12:01,600 --> 05:12:03,600
Easy.

4464
05:12:03,600 --> 05:12:05,600
Use it.

4465
05:12:05,600 --> 05:12:08,600
Ooh.

4466
05:12:08,600 --> 05:12:10,600
This might be the longest hailing mission

4467
05:12:10,600 --> 05:12:12,600
they've actually put in the game.

4468
05:12:12,600 --> 05:12:14,600
Ahhhh.

4469
05:12:14,600 --> 05:12:18,600
This entire act is just tailing missions.

4470
05:12:18,600 --> 05:12:19,600
It's like, tail this person.

4471
05:12:19,600 --> 05:12:20,600
Now don't get me wrong.

4472
05:12:20,600 --> 05:12:23,600
I'm not one of those people that complain about the gameplay.

4473
05:12:23,600 --> 05:12:25,600
Like, if I complained about gameplay,

4474
05:12:25,600 --> 05:12:27,600
I would rather suggest something else

4475
05:12:27,600 --> 05:12:29,600
that's supposed to happen.

4476
05:12:29,600 --> 05:12:33,600
But if you consider all the different types of mechanics

4477
05:12:33,600 --> 05:12:35,600
or subjects that put in the game,

4478
05:12:35,600 --> 05:12:41,600
for example, like the lair of Romulis

4479
05:12:41,600 --> 05:12:43,600
or Leonardo's missions,

4480
05:12:43,600 --> 05:12:45,600
these are completely alternative.

4481
05:12:45,600 --> 05:12:47,600
If you're gonna be like,

4482
05:12:47,600 --> 05:12:48,600
oh, I don't really enjoy tailing missions.

4483
05:12:48,600 --> 05:12:49,600
I completely understand that.

4484
05:12:49,600 --> 05:12:51,600
I'm not dogging on your comment, by the way.

4485
05:12:51,600 --> 05:12:53,600
I'm just discussing it from...

4486
05:12:53,600 --> 05:12:56,600
If you ever wanted to kind of review it.

4487
05:12:56,600 --> 05:12:57,600
Oh, by the way, these guards.

4488
05:12:57,600 --> 05:12:58,600
Useless.

4489
05:12:58,600 --> 05:13:01,600
Absolutely useless.

4490
05:13:01,600 --> 05:13:04,600
You can just walk straight in.

4491
05:13:04,600 --> 05:13:07,600
I think you can also walk past these two

4492
05:13:07,600 --> 05:13:10,600
if you get into that hay bale.

4493
05:13:10,600 --> 05:13:12,600
They just forget you exist.

4494
05:13:12,600 --> 05:13:13,600
They think you're a fart.

4495
05:13:13,600 --> 05:13:15,600
Oh, whoopsies, whoopsies.

4496
05:13:15,600 --> 05:13:17,600
Whoopsies, I wasn't paying attention.

4497
05:13:17,600 --> 05:13:18,600
Whoopsies.

4498
05:13:18,600 --> 05:13:21,600
So it doesn't matter if the guards spot me.

4499
05:13:21,600 --> 05:13:22,600
It's not a problem.

4500
05:13:22,600 --> 05:13:25,600
Although, if I run, it does fulfill the...

4501
05:13:25,600 --> 05:13:27,600
Can you go in the hay bale?

4502
05:13:27,600 --> 05:13:28,600
Jeez, my goodness, gravy.

4503
05:13:28,600 --> 05:13:29,600
It's evil.

4504
05:13:29,600 --> 05:13:31,600
Are you okay?

4505
05:13:31,600 --> 05:13:34,600
Well, nerve is nilly, honestly.

4506
05:13:34,600 --> 05:13:35,600
You can...

4507
05:13:35,600 --> 05:13:37,600
If they stop looking at me...

4508
05:13:37,600 --> 05:13:39,600
Yeah, okay, yeah.

4509
05:13:39,600 --> 05:13:42,600
You hardly have to kill anyone in these kind of things.

4510
05:13:42,600 --> 05:13:44,600
The game is so forgiving.

4511
05:13:44,600 --> 05:13:47,600
That's why I absolutely adore about Assassin's Creed Brotherhood.

4512
05:13:47,600 --> 05:13:49,600
It is so forgiving.

4513
05:13:49,600 --> 05:13:50,600
Now, don't get me wrong.

4514
05:13:50,600 --> 05:13:52,600
You'll still get a few things where they're like,

4515
05:13:52,600 --> 05:13:55,600
that shouldn't have got me, but yeah.

4516
05:13:55,600 --> 05:13:56,600
It's so forgiving.

4517
05:13:56,600 --> 05:13:57,600
So if you hide in the hay bale,

4518
05:13:57,600 --> 05:13:58,600
wait for this guy to come up,

4519
05:13:58,600 --> 05:14:00,600
and then send him a...

4520
05:14:00,600 --> 05:14:02,600
Oh, he doesn't come up.

4521
05:14:02,600 --> 05:14:04,600
Well, wait for the guy to go away,

4522
05:14:04,600 --> 05:14:05,600
and then...

4523
05:14:05,600 --> 05:14:06,600
Yep, there you go.

4524
05:14:06,600 --> 05:14:08,600
It's so quick.

4525
05:14:14,600 --> 05:14:17,600
So, he gets on a horse.

4526
05:14:17,600 --> 05:14:19,600
You're actually supposed to go over here

4527
05:14:19,600 --> 05:14:21,600
to get on a horse,

4528
05:14:21,600 --> 05:14:23,600
to continue to follow him.

4529
05:14:26,600 --> 05:14:27,600
But it's not really obvious.

4530
05:14:27,600 --> 05:14:29,600
Like, most people would just chase on foot,

4531
05:14:29,600 --> 05:14:31,600
which is completely doable.

4532
05:14:31,600 --> 05:14:33,600
But for some reason, they put the horses...

4533
05:14:33,600 --> 05:14:35,600
A wee bit to the left, and...

4534
05:14:35,600 --> 05:14:37,600
Yeah.

4535
05:14:38,600 --> 05:14:41,600
It's a bit harder to recognise.

4536
05:14:41,600 --> 05:14:42,600
But yeah, definitely this game,

4537
05:14:42,600 --> 05:14:44,600
if you've never played Assassin's Creed before,

4538
05:14:44,600 --> 05:14:46,600
I would actually...

4539
05:14:46,600 --> 05:14:48,600
You'd miss out on the plot of two,

4540
05:14:48,600 --> 05:14:50,600
which is the start of Itzu's story,

4541
05:14:50,600 --> 05:14:53,600
but mechanic and forgiveness-wise.

4542
05:14:53,600 --> 05:14:55,600
If you're not really a strong gamer,

4543
05:14:55,600 --> 05:14:57,600
Brotherhood definitely is one for you.

4544
05:14:57,600 --> 05:14:59,600
Um...

4545
05:14:59,600 --> 05:15:01,600
Ah, my tummy's wobbling if you heard that.

4546
05:15:01,600 --> 05:15:03,600
You probably can't over-the-game play, actually.

4547
05:15:03,600 --> 05:15:04,600
Yeah.

4548
05:15:04,600 --> 05:15:06,600
The fact that you're passionate about the game,

4549
05:15:06,600 --> 05:15:07,600
it's just...

4550
05:15:07,600 --> 05:15:08,600
You latch onto something,

4551
05:15:08,600 --> 05:15:09,600
you can play a game,

4552
05:15:09,600 --> 05:15:11,600
and you have absolutely no idea what to expect,

4553
05:15:11,600 --> 05:15:12,600
and then you just adore it.

4554
05:15:12,600 --> 05:15:15,600
Like, a binding of Isaac is another game.

4555
05:15:15,600 --> 05:15:17,600
I didn't know what to expect,

4556
05:15:17,600 --> 05:15:18,600
and, like, the first time I played it,

4557
05:15:18,600 --> 05:15:20,600
I think I played it for, like, five hours,

4558
05:15:20,600 --> 05:15:21,600
and can't...

4559
05:15:21,600 --> 05:15:24,600
He did the turnaround thing he's now supposed to do,

4560
05:15:24,600 --> 05:15:26,600
and now he's chasing me!

4561
05:15:26,600 --> 05:15:28,600
Leave me alone!

4562
05:15:28,600 --> 05:15:30,600
Oh, my God.

4563
05:15:31,600 --> 05:15:32,600
That was...

4564
05:15:32,600 --> 05:15:34,600
That was gonna desync so hard,

4565
05:15:34,600 --> 05:15:37,600
all because he freakin' turned around!

4566
05:15:37,600 --> 05:15:39,600
I knew you were gonna do that.

4567
05:15:39,600 --> 05:15:40,600
I warned you guys.

4568
05:15:40,600 --> 05:15:43,600
He always turns around in this tail-in mission.

4569
05:15:43,600 --> 05:15:45,600
He gets caught on NPCs,

4570
05:15:45,600 --> 05:15:48,600
and spins around.

4571
05:15:48,600 --> 05:15:50,600
It scares me every time.

4572
05:15:50,600 --> 05:15:53,600
I never expect that...

4573
05:15:53,600 --> 05:15:54,600
He was chasing me, though.

4574
05:15:54,600 --> 05:15:56,600
I don't normally expect them to, like,

4575
05:15:56,600 --> 05:15:58,600
turn around and chase,

4576
05:15:58,600 --> 05:16:01,600
but I guess if you're close enough, they will.

4577
05:16:03,600 --> 05:16:06,600
I'm also gonna visit your mum.

4578
05:16:06,600 --> 05:16:08,600
Um...

4579
05:16:08,600 --> 05:16:09,600
Have a nice visit.

4580
05:16:09,600 --> 05:16:10,600
Sorry.

4581
05:16:10,600 --> 05:16:11,600
I was gonna say something really mean,

4582
05:16:11,600 --> 05:16:13,600
but I refrained.

4583
05:16:13,600 --> 05:16:14,600
I was gonna say,

4584
05:16:14,600 --> 05:16:17,600
I saw her earlier this day.

4585
05:16:17,600 --> 05:16:18,600
Oh, he's done it again!

4586
05:16:18,600 --> 05:16:19,600
No way!

4587
05:16:19,600 --> 05:16:20,600
I'm gonna chat!

4588
05:16:20,600 --> 05:16:21,600
Don't do that again.

4589
05:16:21,600 --> 05:16:22,600
Don't do that again!

4590
05:16:22,600 --> 05:16:26,600
You're giving me a heart attack.

4591
05:16:26,600 --> 05:16:27,600
Goodness me.

4592
05:16:27,600 --> 05:16:29,600
A stronghold's off to visit his mum.

4593
05:16:29,600 --> 05:16:30,600
Doing your mom!

4594
05:16:30,600 --> 05:16:32,600
Doing, doing your mom!

4595
05:16:32,600 --> 05:16:35,600
You know he's strictly doing your mom.

4596
05:16:37,600 --> 05:16:39,600
Um...

4597
05:16:39,600 --> 05:16:40,600
So...

4598
05:16:40,600 --> 05:16:41,600
Oh!

4599
05:16:41,600 --> 05:16:43,600
Please don't attack me.

4600
05:16:43,600 --> 05:16:45,600
Incredible.

4601
05:16:45,600 --> 05:16:47,600
Let the recruits deal with it.

4602
05:16:47,600 --> 05:16:49,600
Oh, this isn't the right way!

4603
05:16:49,600 --> 05:16:51,600
This isn't the way to victory!

4604
05:16:51,600 --> 05:16:52,600
To victory!

4605
05:16:52,600 --> 05:16:53,600
To victory!

4606
05:16:53,600 --> 05:16:54,600
This ain't the way to victory!

4607
05:16:54,600 --> 05:16:56,600
My assassins are now...

4608
05:16:56,600 --> 05:16:58,600
Uh, fighting it out.

4609
05:16:58,600 --> 05:17:01,600
I hope they're leveled up enough to deal with them.

4610
05:17:01,600 --> 05:17:03,600
To deal with them, to deal with them.

4611
05:17:03,600 --> 05:17:05,600
I hope they're leveled up enough to deal with them.

4612
05:17:05,600 --> 05:17:09,600
Because I don't have any more recruits!

4613
05:17:09,600 --> 05:17:10,600
Oh, no!

4614
05:17:10,600 --> 05:17:13,600
I needed recruits to 100% this mission.

4615
05:17:13,600 --> 05:17:17,600
Can I just stand about and wait for them to reappear?

4616
05:17:17,600 --> 05:17:21,600
Because I am patient enough to do that.

4617
05:17:21,600 --> 05:17:23,600
Um...

4618
05:17:23,600 --> 05:17:25,600
Destruction, destruction!

4619
05:17:28,600 --> 05:17:31,600
Oh, I wanna play GTA 4 actually.

4620
05:17:31,600 --> 05:17:33,600
An eco.

4621
05:17:33,600 --> 05:17:35,600
Want to go bowling?

4622
05:17:35,600 --> 05:17:38,600
Oh, they didn't come there.

4623
05:17:38,600 --> 05:17:40,600
One more minute.

4624
05:17:40,600 --> 05:17:42,600
Oh look, they've lost the health bar.

4625
05:17:42,600 --> 05:17:44,600
See, that's why I always put it into health.

4626
05:17:44,600 --> 05:17:47,600
Because they can make as many mistakes as they need to.

4627
05:17:47,600 --> 05:17:51,600
Wait, why am I getting yellowed?

4628
05:17:51,600 --> 05:17:55,600
Why am I getting yellowed when my assassin recruits are going ham?

4629
05:17:55,600 --> 05:17:58,600
Am I not going to be detected? I bloody hope not.

4630
05:17:58,600 --> 05:18:00,600
Right, that's fine. I can be detected.

4631
05:18:00,600 --> 05:18:02,600
Who is shooting?

4632
05:18:02,600 --> 05:18:05,600
What is going on over there?

4633
05:18:05,600 --> 05:18:07,600
Do you not need to reload?

4634
05:18:07,600 --> 05:18:09,600
Hello?

4635
05:18:12,600 --> 05:18:13,600
They just despawned.

4636
05:18:13,600 --> 05:18:16,600
Okay, well, as long as they're not dead, I guess.

4637
05:18:16,600 --> 05:18:19,600
Jeez.

4638
05:18:20,600 --> 05:18:22,600
No, you did not name your...

4639
05:18:22,600 --> 05:18:24,600
No, you didn't...

4640
05:18:24,600 --> 05:18:28,600
Bro, someone in chat has named themselves Fondle of Buzum.

4641
05:18:28,600 --> 05:18:30,600
Frickin...

4642
05:18:30,600 --> 05:18:32,600
No, I can't see it anymore.

4643
05:18:32,600 --> 05:18:34,600
Did Mods time you ever for that?

4644
05:18:34,600 --> 05:18:36,600
That's hilarious.

4645
05:18:36,600 --> 05:18:38,600
You don't need to tell that.

4646
05:18:38,600 --> 05:18:42,600
I read that. It was like Fondle of Buzum, Gen Zero B sucky.

4647
05:18:42,600 --> 05:18:44,600
I don't see it anymore.

4648
05:18:44,600 --> 05:18:46,600
Mods timed out, it was funny.

4649
05:18:46,600 --> 05:18:48,600
Unless you were spamming, then get bonked.

4650
05:18:48,600 --> 05:18:50,600
But that was kind of funny, I have to admit.

4651
05:18:52,600 --> 05:18:54,600
I almost ran out of time there.

4652
05:18:54,600 --> 05:18:56,600
I'm too busy reading chat.

4653
05:18:56,600 --> 05:18:58,600
I literally sounded like a monkey there.

4654
05:18:58,600 --> 05:19:00,600
I'm not even pretending.

4655
05:19:00,600 --> 05:19:02,600
I almost ran out of time.

4656
05:19:05,600 --> 05:19:07,600
Do not turn around again, I'm going to be so upset.

4657
05:19:07,600 --> 05:19:10,600
I don't think he does it too much in the sequence part.

4658
05:19:12,600 --> 05:19:15,600
It's the ghost of Christmas pass, Frickin yeah.

4659
05:19:18,600 --> 05:19:20,600
Yeah.

4660
05:19:26,600 --> 05:19:30,600
My voice literally can't right now.

4661
05:19:30,600 --> 05:19:33,600
Oh, he's getting really far ahead actually, hold on.

4662
05:19:33,600 --> 05:19:36,600
Sorry, I'm just really enjoying reading chat with you.

4663
05:19:36,600 --> 05:19:38,600
I apologize.

4664
05:19:38,600 --> 05:19:43,600
Because I remember that people enjoy when they get their stuff read out.

4665
05:19:43,600 --> 05:19:46,600
I never did my high sing.

4666
05:19:46,600 --> 05:19:48,600
Could I do the high sing?

4667
05:19:48,600 --> 05:19:51,600
So, sometimes when I started upstream,

4668
05:19:51,600 --> 05:19:54,600
I would actually read everyone's name out

4669
05:19:54,600 --> 05:19:57,600
just to try and be super thankful.

4670
05:19:57,600 --> 05:20:01,600
Maybe for the ASMR stream we could try it.

4671
05:20:01,600 --> 05:20:07,600
Because I understand people want to hear their name be said by me.

4672
05:20:07,600 --> 05:20:09,600
Because it's nice to be acknowledged.

4673
05:20:09,600 --> 05:20:15,600
Let's not pretend it's not nice to have streamer reply directly type thing.

4674
05:20:15,600 --> 05:20:17,600
Or like generally discuss it.

4675
05:20:17,600 --> 05:20:20,600
So maybe in the ASMR stream, like as a one off,

4676
05:20:20,600 --> 05:20:23,600
I will try my best to like say hi to everyone.

4677
05:20:23,600 --> 05:20:25,600
You there.

4678
05:20:27,600 --> 05:20:29,600
That's a lot of enemies.

4679
05:20:29,600 --> 05:20:31,600
I got enemies.

4680
05:20:31,600 --> 05:20:33,600
I'm calling in my recruits.

4681
05:20:33,600 --> 05:20:36,600
Okay, let's get to the fight.

4682
05:20:36,600 --> 05:20:38,600
Take this.

4683
05:20:38,600 --> 05:20:40,600
And this.

4684
05:20:40,600 --> 05:20:42,600
And that.

4685
05:20:42,600 --> 05:20:44,600
And this.

4686
05:20:44,600 --> 05:20:46,600
Okay.

4687
05:20:46,600 --> 05:20:49,600
I actually...

4688
05:20:49,600 --> 05:20:54,600
I'm gonna heal up and try and pick up a medicine vial.

4689
05:20:54,600 --> 05:20:56,600
Real names or username?

4690
05:20:56,600 --> 05:20:58,600
I would not say your real names.

4691
05:20:58,600 --> 05:21:01,600
I would never encourage anyone to use their real name.

4692
05:21:01,600 --> 05:21:07,600
On the internet, I name yourself something funny.

4693
05:21:07,600 --> 05:21:12,600
Or after like a video game for example.

4694
05:21:12,600 --> 05:21:14,600
Oh, there's no way I'm getting...

4695
05:21:14,600 --> 05:21:17,600
Is he gonna leave me alone or doesn't he hurt him?

4696
05:21:17,600 --> 05:21:22,600
I'm gonna hurt you if you come any closer.

4697
05:21:22,600 --> 05:21:25,600
It's you! You're aimbot!

4698
05:21:25,600 --> 05:21:28,600
Your armor is not that good, sir.

4699
05:21:28,600 --> 05:21:31,600
I know for a fact your armor is not that good.

4700
05:21:31,600 --> 05:21:33,600
Give me my crossbow bolt back right now.

4701
05:21:33,600 --> 05:21:35,600
I know you have some on your persons.

4702
05:21:35,600 --> 05:21:37,600
Not the knife.

4703
05:21:37,600 --> 05:21:39,600
It's not a knife.

4704
05:21:39,600 --> 05:21:40,600
That's a sword.

4705
05:21:40,600 --> 05:21:42,600
Yeah, exactly. Give me my crossbow bolt back.

4706
05:21:42,600 --> 05:21:44,600
That's exactly what I thought.

4707
05:21:44,600 --> 05:21:48,600
You're not that guy. Trust me, you're not that guy pal.

4708
05:21:48,600 --> 05:21:49,600
I started doing a marathon.

4709
05:21:49,600 --> 05:21:50,600
Imagine if you did Arkham Knight.

4710
05:21:50,600 --> 05:21:52,600
Oh, I did play Batman.

4711
05:21:52,600 --> 05:21:54,600
I'm gonna play the Batman.

4712
05:21:54,600 --> 05:21:56,600
Please don't stop and look at me.

4713
05:21:56,600 --> 05:21:58,600
Please don't stop.

4714
05:22:03,600 --> 05:22:06,600
The assassin should kill that third guy.

4715
05:22:06,600 --> 05:22:08,600
What is going on?

4716
05:22:08,600 --> 05:22:11,600
It's so loud when you guys kill people.

4717
05:22:11,600 --> 05:22:16,600
Okay, now the whole of Roma knows

4718
05:22:16,600 --> 05:22:20,600
that you're shooting guns over there.

4719
05:22:20,600 --> 05:22:23,600
Stranny's not your enemy.

4720
05:22:23,600 --> 05:22:25,600
Oh my god, it's Fond de la Buzum.

4721
05:22:25,600 --> 05:22:28,600
Are you gonna role play Azura?

4722
05:22:28,600 --> 05:22:30,600
In chat?

4723
05:22:34,600 --> 05:22:36,600
Damn, I hope to see it as long as I play.

4724
05:22:36,600 --> 05:22:38,600
It's very long.

4725
05:22:38,600 --> 05:22:40,600
More like can.

4726
05:22:40,600 --> 05:22:42,600
It's a little arm cannon.

4727
05:22:45,600 --> 05:22:48,600
I guess you could go through the live-shot participant tab.

4728
05:22:48,600 --> 05:22:50,600
Wait, I can see a list of everyone watching?

4729
05:22:50,600 --> 05:22:52,600
No, that's only on Twitch.

4730
05:22:54,600 --> 05:22:56,600
Maybe at the start of this ASMR.

4731
05:22:56,600 --> 05:22:59,600
As of one off, because it's just not plausible to keep up.

4732
05:22:59,600 --> 05:23:01,600
But just as a thank you for showing up,

4733
05:23:01,600 --> 05:23:03,600
still being here, still meaming around.

4734
05:23:04,600 --> 05:23:06,600
I haven't played Assassin's Creed,

4735
05:23:06,600 --> 05:23:08,600
but it seems similar to Arkham Knight.

4736
05:23:08,600 --> 05:23:12,600
I wouldn't entirely disagree.

4737
05:23:12,600 --> 05:23:19,600
Very agile, very agility-based.

4738
05:23:19,600 --> 05:23:24,600
Definitely, you know, hunting around.

4739
05:23:24,600 --> 05:23:27,600
This 100% is just don't kill anyone.

4740
05:23:27,600 --> 05:23:30,600
If you scoot your bot all the way along the Colosseum,

4741
05:23:30,600 --> 05:23:32,600
absolutely no issues.

4742
05:23:32,600 --> 05:23:34,600
You shouldn't run into any guards.

4743
05:23:34,600 --> 05:23:36,600
If you do, you can literally just hang off the ledge.

4744
05:23:36,600 --> 05:23:38,600
I wish I had the climbing glove, though.

4745
05:23:38,600 --> 05:23:43,600
That Leonardo bench would have came in clutch for this part of the section.

4746
05:23:43,600 --> 05:23:46,600
But unfortunately...

4747
05:23:46,600 --> 05:23:48,600
I don't have that.

4748
05:23:48,600 --> 05:23:50,600
Where am I supposed to go?

4749
05:23:50,600 --> 05:23:53,600
So the watchpoint is all the way...

4750
05:23:53,600 --> 05:23:55,600
Oh my god, that stance...

4751
05:23:55,600 --> 05:23:57,600
It actually looks pretty funny.

4752
05:24:01,600 --> 05:24:06,600
We're gonna go for this...

4753
05:24:06,600 --> 05:24:09,600
Whoa, I didn't even realize that guard could see me.

4754
05:24:09,600 --> 05:24:11,600
What? How could he even see me?

4755
05:24:11,600 --> 05:24:13,600
We'll go for the viewpoint,

4756
05:24:13,600 --> 05:24:16,600
and then we will continue with this mission.

4757
05:24:16,600 --> 05:24:19,600
This act is getting very close to being finished.

4758
05:24:19,600 --> 05:24:21,600
And then we will have a five-minute break.

4759
05:24:21,600 --> 05:24:23,600
I will read any marshmallows.

4760
05:24:23,600 --> 05:24:26,600
So if you want to ask any questions, you're more than can.

4761
05:24:26,600 --> 05:24:33,600
I did miss some during the 2.0 and the exposing Bielor.

4762
05:24:33,600 --> 05:24:36,600
Not that it wasn't good enough,

4763
05:24:36,600 --> 05:24:38,600
but maybe it wasn't on-subject,

4764
05:24:38,600 --> 05:24:42,600
or didn't quite necessarily relate to me for the 2.0.

4765
05:24:42,600 --> 05:24:44,600
So I just sent it.

4766
05:24:44,600 --> 05:24:46,600
So don't worry, I might give that a good week.

4767
05:24:46,600 --> 05:24:48,600
But you're welcome to ask any questions,

4768
05:24:48,600 --> 05:24:50,600
and then we will rehydrate.

4769
05:24:50,600 --> 05:24:52,600
I'm getting a T.

4770
05:24:52,600 --> 05:24:54,600
My voice is perishing.

4771
05:24:54,600 --> 05:24:57,600
Right, where am I supposed to go?

4772
05:24:57,600 --> 05:24:59,600
Over there?

4773
05:24:59,600 --> 05:25:02,600
There is a feather on top of the Colosseum,

4774
05:25:02,600 --> 05:25:04,600
but I'm actually happy to just climb up again.

4775
05:25:04,600 --> 05:25:06,600
Okay, that's where we're supposed to go.

4776
05:25:06,600 --> 05:25:10,600
Couldn't see it because of the render distance,

4777
05:25:10,600 --> 05:25:13,600
but that's okay, because this is an older game.

4778
05:25:15,600 --> 05:25:18,600
If you look at the three dots where it has time stamps

4779
05:25:18,600 --> 05:25:21,600
and reactions and option to pop out chat,

4780
05:25:21,600 --> 05:25:23,600
I think it's just chatters that have typed in chat.

4781
05:25:23,600 --> 05:25:25,600
I didn't know that.

4782
05:25:25,600 --> 05:25:27,600
I was just going to get you all to be like,

4783
05:25:27,600 --> 05:25:29,600
hi, and then start reading your name,

4784
05:25:29,600 --> 05:25:31,600
ear to ear.

4785
05:25:33,600 --> 05:25:35,600
Senior.

4786
05:25:35,600 --> 05:25:37,600
I've been waiting away for the last hour.

4787
05:25:37,600 --> 05:25:39,600
No, you haven't missed a thing.

4788
05:25:39,600 --> 05:25:41,600
I'm giving away.

4789
05:25:41,600 --> 05:25:45,600
We are on sequence six,

4790
05:25:45,600 --> 05:25:47,600
which is...

4791
05:25:47,600 --> 05:25:49,600
My god!

4792
05:25:49,600 --> 05:25:52,600
Why has thou forsaken me?

4793
05:25:55,600 --> 05:25:56,600
Right, heading out.

4794
05:25:56,600 --> 05:25:57,600
Thank you for hanging.

4795
05:25:57,600 --> 05:25:59,600
Again, anyone who is watching,

4796
05:25:59,600 --> 05:26:01,600
you've done so far.

4797
05:26:01,600 --> 05:26:02,600
You've done well so far.

4798
05:26:02,600 --> 05:26:03,600
It's five and a half hours.

4799
05:26:03,600 --> 05:26:05,600
I don't expect you to be here for the film.

4800
05:26:05,600 --> 05:26:08,600
Please rest when you can.

4801
05:26:08,600 --> 05:26:09,600
And also,

4802
05:26:09,600 --> 05:26:11,600
M.E. is streaming ASMR live.

4803
05:26:11,600 --> 05:26:12,600
If you'd like to check that out,

4804
05:26:12,600 --> 05:26:15,600
M.E.Bizu, she's linked below in my description.

4805
05:26:15,600 --> 05:26:17,600
Thank you so much.

4806
05:26:19,600 --> 05:26:21,600
No more.

4807
05:26:23,600 --> 05:26:26,600
So please don't be afraid to check out her ASMRs.

4808
05:26:26,600 --> 05:26:28,600
We are about to finish up the sequence.

4809
05:26:28,600 --> 05:26:31,600
We just need to eliminate these three guards that come up

4810
05:26:31,600 --> 05:26:34,600
and then deal with the poison sequence.

4811
05:26:34,600 --> 05:26:38,600
And then I believe

4812
05:26:38,600 --> 05:26:41,600
that the sequence is over.

4813
05:26:41,600 --> 05:26:45,600
We are getting very close to finishing the campaign.

4814
05:26:45,600 --> 05:26:47,600
Very, very close.

4815
05:26:47,600 --> 05:26:49,600
Just run all the way around the Colosseum at this section

4816
05:26:49,600 --> 05:26:50,600
until you get up to the hay bale.

4817
05:26:50,600 --> 05:26:51,600
There is a treasure chest.

4818
05:26:51,600 --> 05:26:52,600
I always ignore it.

4819
05:26:52,600 --> 05:26:54,600
We can always come back for it later.

4820
05:26:54,600 --> 05:26:55,600
There you go.

4821
05:26:55,600 --> 05:26:58,600
You can instantly assassinate the hay bale.

4822
05:26:58,600 --> 05:27:01,600
Oh, it's four targets.

4823
05:27:01,600 --> 05:27:05,600
Excuse me, such a fakey gamer.

4824
05:27:05,600 --> 05:27:09,600
Again, crossbow bolts are completely silent.

4825
05:27:09,600 --> 05:27:12,600
They will not allure anyone

4826
05:27:12,600 --> 05:27:15,600
to what has happened in the area,

4827
05:27:15,600 --> 05:27:17,600
which is very nice.

4828
05:27:17,600 --> 05:27:21,600
Unfortunately, I'm running rather low on crossbow bolts.

4829
05:27:21,600 --> 05:27:23,600
We are going to wait for this last guy

4830
05:27:23,600 --> 05:27:25,600
to come out on his own

4831
05:27:25,600 --> 05:27:27,600
because if you actually go in there,

4832
05:27:27,600 --> 05:27:28,600
there is a high chance of him

4833
05:27:28,600 --> 05:27:31,600
just straight up turning around and looking at you.

4834
05:27:31,600 --> 05:27:33,600
And then you have to replay this little section again.

4835
05:27:33,600 --> 05:27:35,600
Don't recommend it up to you,

4836
05:27:35,600 --> 05:27:37,600
but he will notice the body

4837
05:27:37,600 --> 05:27:39,600
and then you get the perfect kill.

4838
05:27:39,600 --> 05:27:41,600
I'm going to look at his body

4839
05:27:41,600 --> 05:27:43,600
just because again, we are a bit low on crossbow bolts.

4840
05:27:43,600 --> 05:27:45,600
But that's okay.

4841
05:27:45,600 --> 05:27:47,600
And then you just need to jump down

4842
05:27:47,600 --> 05:27:50,600
on this little...

4843
05:27:50,600 --> 05:27:52,600
How do you call it?

4844
05:27:52,600 --> 05:27:55,600
Hanging.

4845
05:27:55,600 --> 05:27:56,600
Okay.

4846
05:27:56,600 --> 05:27:58,600
Or just don't touch any of it

4847
05:27:58,600 --> 05:27:59,600
and land on your ankles.

4848
05:27:59,600 --> 05:28:00,600
Perfectly fine.

4849
05:28:00,600 --> 05:28:02,600
Don't need them.

4850
05:28:02,600 --> 05:28:04,600
Just completely ignore everything.

4851
05:28:04,600 --> 05:28:06,600
My goodness.

4852
05:28:06,600 --> 05:28:08,600
You saw me reach my armor.

4853
05:28:09,600 --> 05:28:13,600
Just fall to the floor.

4854
05:28:13,600 --> 05:28:15,600
Literally splat.

4855
05:28:15,600 --> 05:28:18,600
You may notice that our health bar is increasing

4856
05:28:18,600 --> 05:28:21,600
even though I'm not buying any new armor or anything.

4857
05:28:21,600 --> 05:28:23,600
That's because after every act,

4858
05:28:23,600 --> 05:28:25,600
you unlock a new health bar.

4859
05:28:25,600 --> 05:28:30,600
So it's not necessary to use your florins on armor,

4860
05:28:30,600 --> 05:28:34,600
but if you definitely are new to the Assassin's Creed,

4861
05:28:34,600 --> 05:28:35,600
it helps out so much.

4862
05:28:35,600 --> 05:28:36,600
It's fantastic.

4863
05:28:36,600 --> 05:28:39,600
And please utilize the tailor's shops

4864
05:28:39,600 --> 05:28:42,600
because tailor's shops have pouches

4865
05:28:42,600 --> 05:28:45,600
that increase how much medicine you can hold,

4866
05:28:45,600 --> 05:28:47,600
how much throwing knives,

4867
05:28:47,600 --> 05:28:50,600
how many crossbow bolts, for example.

4868
05:28:54,600 --> 05:28:56,600
I cannot recommend this game enough.

4869
05:28:56,600 --> 05:29:00,600
Seriously, it's about eight hours total for campaign.

4870
05:29:00,600 --> 05:29:01,600
If you just ignore everything,

4871
05:29:01,600 --> 05:29:03,600
if you want to have a good time and explore,

4872
05:29:03,600 --> 05:29:07,600
you could easily pump maybe 16 hours.

4873
05:29:09,600 --> 05:29:10,600
It's good. Good game.

4874
05:29:10,600 --> 05:29:12,600
Heavily good game.

4875
05:29:13,600 --> 05:29:15,600
My knees could never do that.

4876
05:29:15,600 --> 05:29:16,600
No, I don't think anyone's knees

4877
05:29:16,600 --> 05:29:18,600
could accomplish such a feat.

4878
05:29:18,600 --> 05:29:21,600
Although, I could have sworn I saw some videos

4879
05:29:21,600 --> 05:29:23,600
of, like, you know, in Portal 2,

4880
05:29:23,600 --> 05:29:25,600
like the apparatus that's on the legs

4881
05:29:25,600 --> 05:29:28,600
to stop any fall damage from occurring.

4882
05:29:28,600 --> 05:29:31,600
I'm sure someone was, like, developing that tech

4883
05:29:31,600 --> 05:29:34,600
at one point, like, maybe for Super Soldier,

4884
05:29:34,600 --> 05:29:37,600
really stuff, but, yeah.

4885
05:29:40,600 --> 05:29:41,600
Are you on Steam?

4886
05:29:41,600 --> 05:29:44,600
Yeah, I'm playing Steam right now.

4887
05:29:44,600 --> 05:29:46,600
I was gonna try and do...

4888
05:29:48,600 --> 05:29:50,600
do an Xbox Game Pass,

4889
05:29:50,600 --> 05:29:52,600
but it's not currently on it right now,

4890
05:29:52,600 --> 05:29:55,600
so we don't get the gamer score.

4891
05:30:02,600 --> 05:30:04,600
Poison Stinky.

4892
05:30:06,600 --> 05:30:09,600
Can anyone look up if Cuttlefish have poison?

4893
05:30:09,600 --> 05:30:11,600
I don't know my lore.

4894
05:30:13,600 --> 05:30:14,600
Maybe my poison can...

4895
05:30:14,600 --> 05:30:17,600
Oh, well, I do ink, but is ink poisonous?

4896
05:30:17,600 --> 05:30:19,600
No, it's a deterrent,

4897
05:30:19,600 --> 05:30:21,600
because I can be preyed upon.

4898
05:30:21,600 --> 05:30:23,600
So ink is the Hayden.

4899
05:30:24,600 --> 05:30:25,600
I can bay.

4900
05:30:25,600 --> 05:30:26,600
Yeah, I can.

4901
05:30:26,600 --> 05:30:28,600
You know, I see my teeth, and...

4902
05:30:32,600 --> 05:30:34,600
I wish I had aim like that, that's cool.

4903
05:30:34,600 --> 05:30:37,600
Actually, that's a really, uh...

4904
05:30:37,600 --> 05:30:39,600
I would...

4905
05:30:39,600 --> 05:30:40,600
No.

4906
05:30:40,600 --> 05:30:41,600
Maybe.

4907
05:30:42,600 --> 05:30:45,600
Do you think we could set up axe throwing

4908
05:30:45,600 --> 05:30:47,600
at a VTuber convention?

4909
05:30:47,600 --> 05:30:49,600
I feel like that would be so fun.

4910
05:30:50,600 --> 05:30:53,600
A lot of people, like, can hit the spot or not.

4911
05:30:53,600 --> 05:30:55,600
I feel like it's so specific.

4912
05:30:55,600 --> 05:30:57,600
Whoa, whoa, whoa, Jesus!

4913
05:30:57,600 --> 05:30:59,600
Pick them up, pick them up!

4914
05:31:00,600 --> 05:31:02,600
Quite literally, Jesus.

4915
05:31:02,600 --> 05:31:04,600
Oh, his health is going down because of the poison.

4916
05:31:04,600 --> 05:31:06,600
I've never noticed that before.

4917
05:31:09,600 --> 05:31:10,600
Other way.

4918
05:31:10,600 --> 05:31:11,600
Okay.

4919
05:31:11,600 --> 05:31:12,600
Sorry, assassin recruits.

4920
05:31:12,600 --> 05:31:14,600
I'm gonna need you to, like, hurry up

4921
05:31:14,600 --> 05:31:15,600
and perish these people.

4922
05:31:15,600 --> 05:31:17,600
Like, right now, Pietro, is...

4923
05:31:17,600 --> 05:31:18,600
Oh!

4924
05:31:21,600 --> 05:31:23,600
That's a reefling after I'm done with him

4925
05:31:23,600 --> 05:31:25,600
in the ASMR booth.

4926
05:31:25,600 --> 05:31:26,600
Ah...

4927
05:31:30,600 --> 05:31:31,600
Mmm.

4928
05:31:33,600 --> 05:31:35,600
If you team up with a company that does axe throwing...

4929
05:31:38,600 --> 05:31:40,600
Me next, me next!

4930
05:31:44,600 --> 05:31:46,600
This is me giving you cola

4931
05:31:46,600 --> 05:31:48,600
to make you feel better.

4932
05:31:50,600 --> 05:31:51,600
Give me the keys.

4933
05:31:52,600 --> 05:31:54,600
The castello.

4934
05:31:55,600 --> 05:31:56,600
Oh!

4935
05:31:56,600 --> 05:31:58,600
Did I tell you that

4936
05:31:58,600 --> 05:32:00,600
after Dave...

4937
05:32:13,600 --> 05:32:14,600
Oh!

4938
05:32:14,600 --> 05:32:17,600
It's the real traitor!

4939
05:32:17,600 --> 05:32:20,600
It's not Marcia Valley at all!

4940
05:32:21,600 --> 05:32:22,600
It's you!

4941
05:32:22,600 --> 05:32:24,600
Random thief from cutscene.

4942
05:32:25,600 --> 05:32:26,600
Oh, no!

4943
05:32:26,600 --> 05:32:27,600
No!

4944
05:32:27,600 --> 05:32:28,600
No, no!

4945
05:32:28,600 --> 05:32:29,600
No, no, no!

4946
05:32:29,600 --> 05:32:30,600
Horse!

4947
05:32:30,600 --> 05:32:31,600
Please!

4948
05:32:31,600 --> 05:32:32,600
Please!

4949
05:32:33,600 --> 05:32:35,600
Oh, I'm getting chased by a horse right now.

4950
05:32:36,600 --> 05:32:38,600
I don't know, I think if I fail this section...

4951
05:32:39,600 --> 05:32:41,600
If you jump, you can jump past the guards

4952
05:32:41,600 --> 05:32:43,600
and the AI no longer targets you, I don't know why.

4953
05:32:43,600 --> 05:32:45,600
But there's a horse after me

4954
05:32:45,600 --> 05:32:46,600
and I'm scared!

4955
05:32:47,600 --> 05:32:49,600
I can hear the horse go in me!

4956
05:32:51,600 --> 05:32:52,600
Please!

4957
05:32:52,600 --> 05:32:53,600
Please!

4958
05:32:54,600 --> 05:32:55,600
Please leave me alone.

4959
05:32:55,600 --> 05:33:00,480
Leave me alone! Leave me alone!

4960
05:33:00,480 --> 05:33:02,760
Okay, I think I'm safe from the horse, silly.

4961
05:33:02,760 --> 05:33:06,720
Come here! Come hither! Come hither!

4962
05:33:06,720 --> 05:33:08,280
Ugh, move on.

4963
05:33:18,200 --> 05:33:19,440
Oh, that was...

4964
05:33:19,440 --> 05:33:20,720
That's awful.

4965
05:33:20,720 --> 05:33:25,120
I was right. I have to stop Levopi before he gets to Machiavelli.

4966
05:33:25,120 --> 05:33:28,200
Ah, Levopi's about to kill Machiavelli! Where'd I go?

4967
05:33:28,200 --> 05:33:30,080
Okay, the green on the map.

4968
05:33:30,080 --> 05:33:33,200
Do I need a horse? I can't remember the section very well.

4969
05:33:33,200 --> 05:33:35,440
Ba-bang. Ba-bang.

4970
05:33:35,440 --> 05:33:36,720
I think I can run.

4971
05:33:36,720 --> 05:33:39,320
Ba-bang. Ba-bang.

4972
05:33:39,320 --> 05:33:45,160
If we do not stop Levopi, he literally kills Machiavelli.

4973
05:33:45,160 --> 05:33:48,720
Now, to 100% this, you're not to swim.

4974
05:33:48,840 --> 05:33:50,040
No! Don't pick...

4975
05:33:50,040 --> 05:33:53,200
Oh, for fuck's sake, take the horse then! Jesus!

4976
05:33:54,160 --> 05:33:56,640
God... Goodness, Gravy.

4977
05:33:57,880 --> 05:34:00,320
Oh my god, I'm taking the long way around!

4978
05:34:00,800 --> 05:34:02,320
Ahhhh!

4979
05:34:02,320 --> 05:34:04,520
Panic! Panic! Panic! Panic! Panic!

4980
05:34:06,480 --> 05:34:08,200
What are you doing in Seal?

4981
05:34:08,200 --> 05:34:12,200
Why would you randomly grab that Permanent's horse?

4982
05:34:12,200 --> 05:34:13,480
Climb the wall!

4983
05:34:13,480 --> 05:34:17,320
It hit Seal! Please, that's a tamed mission.

4984
05:34:17,400 --> 05:34:19,880
They stressed me out so much!

4985
05:34:19,880 --> 05:34:22,920
Please, I just want 100% this, so I never have to do it again.

4986
05:34:22,920 --> 05:34:24,680
Please, please, please!

4987
05:34:24,680 --> 05:34:28,120
Oh, why would you randomly take that Permanent's horse?

4988
05:34:32,360 --> 05:34:35,040
I get too stressed out on tamed missions. I hate them.

4989
05:34:35,040 --> 05:34:37,200
Here, take this letter.

4990
05:34:37,200 --> 05:34:38,240
Luton.

4991
05:34:39,120 --> 05:34:41,840
My god, this is good news.

4992
05:34:41,840 --> 05:34:43,840
More than you know.

4993
05:34:43,840 --> 05:34:46,320
I am once again in your death, Ezio.

4994
05:34:46,360 --> 05:34:48,360
What death is there amongst friends?

4995
05:34:48,360 --> 05:34:49,840
Trust one another.

4996
05:34:49,840 --> 05:34:51,120
Yes.

4997
05:34:51,120 --> 05:34:52,120
Thank you for relaying the message tonight.

4998
05:34:52,120 --> 05:34:54,360
I'm literally yoinked that Permanent's horse.

4999
05:34:54,360 --> 05:34:55,280
Calm, Nicolò.

5000
05:34:55,280 --> 05:34:56,400
Okay.

5001
05:34:56,400 --> 05:34:58,040
Love all pain and mark your will.

5002
05:34:58,040 --> 05:35:01,240
I heard Nicolò's impassioned play took an unexpected turn this week.

5003
05:35:01,240 --> 05:35:02,560
Now trust each other.

5004
05:35:02,560 --> 05:35:03,320
Yippee!

5005
05:35:03,320 --> 05:35:07,840
It seems Jezu Cristo was resurrected three days early.

5006
05:35:10,240 --> 05:35:11,440
Ta-da!

5007
05:35:12,680 --> 05:35:15,040
Checkpoint reached. That's not the end?

5008
05:35:15,040 --> 05:35:16,760
Oh, it is the end of the act.

5009
05:35:16,760 --> 05:35:18,760
We're just being teased.

5010
05:35:20,520 --> 05:35:23,360
Crazy Man's Steel's horse jumps off and runs up wall fight.

5011
05:35:23,360 --> 05:35:28,720
Literally, if you hit, like, a graphic thing like this at an angle,

5012
05:35:28,720 --> 05:35:32,240
Ezio refuses to climb the wall

5013
05:35:32,240 --> 05:35:34,320
and it gives me a heart attack every time.

5014
05:35:34,320 --> 05:35:35,840
Like, Ezio, please.

5015
05:35:38,040 --> 05:35:39,440
Look, our thieves are in the...

5016
05:35:39,440 --> 05:35:41,640
Our recruits are in the background.

5017
05:35:43,000 --> 05:35:44,440
Look, it's you in the background!

5018
05:35:44,480 --> 05:35:45,760
It's you in the car scene!

5019
05:35:45,760 --> 05:35:48,360
Well, they're not right now. I can't see them, but...

5020
05:35:53,360 --> 05:35:54,920
It is pain.

5021
05:35:54,920 --> 05:35:57,960
Claudia's gonna become an assassin.

5022
05:36:01,640 --> 05:36:04,360
We work in the dark to serve the light.

5023
05:36:06,720 --> 05:36:09,680
Yeah, absolutely cannot say any of those words.

5024
05:36:09,680 --> 05:36:12,160
Do not ask me to recite that.

5025
05:36:12,160 --> 05:36:13,480
I can say that part.

5026
05:36:14,320 --> 05:36:17,240
We're in our training. Oh, my God, look who you are! Reflinges!

5027
05:36:17,240 --> 05:36:19,440
There's so many of you.

5028
05:36:19,440 --> 05:36:21,640
Look, Reflinges is my sister.

5029
05:36:23,920 --> 05:36:25,320
I'm reciting it right now.

5030
05:36:36,960 --> 05:36:38,560
Oh, my God, they're gonna hold hands.

5031
05:36:38,560 --> 05:36:39,840
Yay!

5032
05:36:39,840 --> 05:36:41,480
She's an assassin.

5033
05:36:41,480 --> 05:36:44,760
If you get an assassin, you have to be branded on your

5034
05:36:44,760 --> 05:36:46,640
wedding ringer...

5035
05:36:46,640 --> 05:36:47,760
wedding finger.

5036
05:36:49,160 --> 05:36:50,240
Where the ring goes.

5037
05:36:52,280 --> 05:36:53,800
Is your sister single?

5038
05:36:53,800 --> 05:36:54,920
Hi, Claudia.

5039
05:36:56,240 --> 05:36:59,720
You and I have not seen eye-to-eye on many issues.

5040
05:36:59,720 --> 05:37:00,720
Just letting out.

5041
05:37:00,720 --> 05:37:03,080
But you are exactly what the order means.

5042
05:37:03,080 --> 05:37:04,280
We cannot promote it.

5043
05:37:04,280 --> 05:37:06,880
You have led the charge against the Templars

5044
05:37:06,880 --> 05:37:09,160
and rebuilt this brotherhood.

5045
05:37:09,160 --> 05:37:12,360
Now, we must put Ezio when he be locked up.

5046
05:37:12,360 --> 05:37:13,480
Refling!

5047
05:37:13,480 --> 05:37:17,080
Oh, my God, is Reflinges crowning me as their Ushides?

5048
05:37:17,080 --> 05:37:19,920
Ezio, Auditore, Daffy Vence.

5049
05:37:19,920 --> 05:37:22,800
You will now be known as Il Mentore,

5050
05:37:22,800 --> 05:37:25,360
the guardian of our order and our cities.

5051
05:37:27,640 --> 05:37:29,280
No, I can't be Kama Ushii.

5052
05:37:29,280 --> 05:37:32,280
I don't mean Ushii, but Kama Ushii is impossible to live up to.

5053
05:37:32,280 --> 05:37:33,480
That's not possible.

5054
05:37:33,480 --> 05:37:34,960
Remember, nothing is true.

5055
05:37:34,960 --> 05:37:35,880
It's true.

5056
05:37:35,880 --> 05:37:37,680
Everything is permanent.

5057
05:37:37,760 --> 05:37:41,360
Where other men are limited by morality and law.

5058
05:37:41,360 --> 05:37:44,120
Remember, everything is permitted.

5059
05:37:46,960 --> 05:37:48,400
It's Ezio before or after.

5060
05:37:48,400 --> 05:37:49,240
He is after.

5061
05:37:49,240 --> 05:37:50,720
Altair is like...

5062
05:37:51,720 --> 05:37:53,720
I don't even know what century Altair is.

5063
05:37:54,840 --> 05:37:56,440
Why this sudden change of heart?

5064
05:37:56,440 --> 05:37:57,760
I'm a cameo assassin.

5065
05:37:59,120 --> 05:38:01,600
I was the one who brought you to Roma

5066
05:38:01,600 --> 05:38:04,600
and the one who caused the explosion as you fled the Castello.

5067
05:38:04,600 --> 05:38:05,520
What?

5068
05:38:05,520 --> 05:38:09,920
The mercenaries who protected you at Il Colosseo were mine as well.

5069
05:38:09,920 --> 05:38:11,560
You just did not know it.

5070
05:38:11,560 --> 05:38:15,240
Maestro Mattiaveli, Cesare has returned to Roma alone.

5071
05:38:15,240 --> 05:38:16,960
He rides for the Castel Sant'Angelo.

5072
05:38:16,960 --> 05:38:17,800
Thank you.

5073
05:38:18,880 --> 05:38:20,720
Well...

5074
05:38:20,720 --> 05:38:23,440
The decision is yours, not mine.

5075
05:38:23,440 --> 05:38:27,600
Niccolo, you better not stop telling me what you think.

5076
05:38:27,600 --> 05:38:31,640
Why else would I seek the opinion of my most trusted advisor?

5077
05:38:31,640 --> 05:38:33,520
Go kill them, Mentore.

5078
05:38:33,560 --> 05:38:34,840
Finish what you start.

5079
05:38:35,680 --> 05:38:36,680
Good advice.

5080
05:38:39,520 --> 05:38:42,200
I can write a book about you one day.

5081
05:38:42,200 --> 05:38:44,120
If you do, it will be short.

5082
05:38:44,120 --> 05:38:45,800
You've been my OSHA since day one, just accept it.

5083
05:38:45,800 --> 05:38:48,240
I don't get it, like how?

5084
05:38:48,240 --> 05:38:49,680
How?

5085
05:38:49,680 --> 05:38:53,880
You tell me you've consumed all of these content creators

5086
05:38:53,880 --> 05:38:55,440
and you're like...

5087
05:38:55,440 --> 05:38:56,640
Yeah.

5088
05:38:56,640 --> 05:38:57,600
That one.

5089
05:38:57,600 --> 05:38:58,520
Out of them all.

5090
05:38:58,520 --> 05:38:59,360
Okay.

5091
05:39:00,360 --> 05:39:02,480
We have finished Sequence Seven.

5092
05:39:02,480 --> 05:39:07,600
There are two more sequences and then we've done the campaign.

5093
05:39:07,600 --> 05:39:09,720
It's actually finishing a lot earlier than I thought.

5094
05:39:09,720 --> 05:39:13,080
I've still got a couple of more hours in me, okay?

5095
05:39:13,080 --> 05:39:14,760
When it clicks, it clicks.

5096
05:39:14,760 --> 05:39:15,800
You don't pick the OSHA.

5097
05:39:15,800 --> 05:39:17,480
The OSHA does pick you.

5098
05:39:20,240 --> 05:39:21,760
When you know, you know.

5099
05:39:21,760 --> 05:39:23,400
Wait, the game is really that short.

5100
05:39:23,400 --> 05:39:26,840
If you ignore everything and do campaign only,

5101
05:39:26,840 --> 05:39:29,800
like, send it on the campaign, then...

5102
05:39:29,800 --> 05:39:31,960
On it, right?

5103
05:39:31,960 --> 05:39:32,800
Pretty.

5104
05:39:32,800 --> 05:39:34,000
You can wrap up.

5105
05:39:35,520 --> 05:39:37,240
Real quick.

5106
05:39:37,240 --> 05:39:41,720
I am going to destroy another tower

5107
05:39:41,720 --> 05:39:45,720
because I want to unlock this third signal

5108
05:39:45,720 --> 05:39:48,440
and then we will...

5109
05:39:48,440 --> 05:39:49,720
Actually, you know what?

5110
05:39:49,720 --> 05:39:53,160
I'm going to send my assassins on a mission.

5111
05:39:53,160 --> 05:39:56,520
I'm going to pee and make a cup of tea and get some food.

5112
05:39:56,840 --> 05:39:59,400
And we can just take a little five minutes to ourselves.

5113
05:39:59,400 --> 05:40:00,800
A little tea break.

5114
05:40:02,760 --> 05:40:05,080
I'll send some of the wee...

5115
05:40:05,080 --> 05:40:07,600
Oh, that's like everyone for that one mission.

5116
05:40:08,960 --> 05:40:11,880
No ideal, but it's fine.

5117
05:40:11,880 --> 05:40:13,000
Can you 100% not?

5118
05:40:13,000 --> 05:40:14,720
You can, so that will be a level up.

5119
05:40:14,720 --> 05:40:16,000
Okay.

5120
05:40:16,000 --> 05:40:19,000
Right, everyone.

5121
05:40:19,000 --> 05:40:20,440
I don't want to be too close to the pigeons

5122
05:40:20,440 --> 05:40:22,360
because they literally go...

5123
05:40:22,360 --> 05:40:25,520
in your ear, so hopefully that's not too bad

5124
05:40:25,520 --> 05:40:27,760
for ambience.

5125
05:40:27,760 --> 05:40:30,760
Everyone, please do consider standing up

5126
05:40:30,760 --> 05:40:34,600
and getting your wee legs and blood flow going

5127
05:40:34,600 --> 05:40:35,600
or wiggle your toes.

5128
05:40:35,600 --> 05:40:37,480
If you're that lazy, stretch your feet

5129
05:40:37,480 --> 05:40:38,880
and pull them back and forth

5130
05:40:38,880 --> 05:40:41,960
so your muscles and your calves

5131
05:40:41,960 --> 05:40:43,600
like come back and forth.

5132
05:40:43,600 --> 05:40:46,320
Go for a pee, get some water, some snacks,

5133
05:40:46,320 --> 05:40:49,400
some juicy juice, hypotenuse,

5134
05:40:49,400 --> 05:40:54,400
and I will be back in roughly three minutes.

5135
05:40:55,160 --> 05:40:59,040
I'm gonna try and heat up ravioli like fast as anything.

5136
05:41:00,560 --> 05:41:01,800
So I will be a moment.

5137
05:41:01,800 --> 05:41:04,720
If you would like to watch Emmy while she does ASMR live,

5138
05:41:04,720 --> 05:41:06,160
her link is in my description.

5139
05:41:06,160 --> 05:41:08,440
You can do that right now, okay?

5140
05:41:08,440 --> 05:41:10,960
I will do the old pretending to sleep

5141
05:41:10,960 --> 05:41:13,920
and then I'll open up the game again, okay?

5142
05:41:13,920 --> 05:41:15,360
So don't worry.

5143
05:41:15,360 --> 05:41:17,400
Don't worry about it.

5144
05:41:17,400 --> 05:41:18,560
Eesh.

5145
05:41:18,560 --> 05:41:19,400
Eesh.

5146
05:41:20,760 --> 05:41:21,880
It caused my eyes.

5147
05:41:24,400 --> 05:41:25,360
Eesh.

5148
05:41:54,400 --> 05:41:55,240
Eesh.

5149
05:42:24,400 --> 05:42:25,240
Eesh.

5150
05:42:54,400 --> 05:42:55,240
Eesh.

5151
05:43:24,400 --> 05:43:25,240
Eesh.

5152
05:43:54,400 --> 05:43:55,240
Eesh.

5153
05:44:24,400 --> 05:44:25,240
Eesh.

5154
05:44:54,400 --> 05:44:55,240
Eesh.

5155
05:45:24,400 --> 05:45:25,240
Eesh.

5156
05:45:54,400 --> 05:45:55,240
Eesh.

5157
05:46:24,400 --> 05:46:25,240
Eesh.

5158
05:46:54,400 --> 05:46:55,240
Eesh.

5159
05:47:24,400 --> 05:47:25,240
Eesh.

5160
05:47:54,400 --> 05:47:55,240
Eesh.

5161
05:48:24,400 --> 05:48:25,240
Eesh.

5162
05:48:54,400 --> 05:48:55,240
Eesh.

5163
05:49:16,240 --> 05:49:17,080
Oh.

5164
05:49:19,480 --> 05:49:20,760
I had no idea I left eights.

5165
05:49:20,760 --> 05:49:21,760
He was sitting like that.

5166
05:49:21,760 --> 05:49:22,760
That was crazy.

5167
05:49:23,720 --> 05:49:26,680
I was like, oh, we already had a recruits come back as well.

5168
05:49:27,800 --> 05:49:29,120
Okay.

5169
05:49:29,120 --> 05:49:32,160
I've got me, I've got all my food.

5170
05:49:32,160 --> 05:49:37,160
I have a bowl and it has race pea snacks.

5171
05:49:37,400 --> 05:49:42,400
It has two stick meat and one, eight and two egg.

5172
05:49:45,120 --> 05:49:46,720
I'm just gonna send this assassin away

5173
05:49:46,720 --> 05:49:49,000
to get like even more stronger.

5174
05:49:49,720 --> 05:49:53,720
Because we're cained again to that heart.

5175
05:49:53,720 --> 05:49:54,560
Jesus.

5176
05:49:54,560 --> 05:49:55,400
Is there any level three?

5177
05:49:55,400 --> 05:49:56,240
This is my goodness.

5178
05:49:56,240 --> 05:49:57,960
That took a while to find.

5179
05:49:57,960 --> 05:50:01,480
Oh, she went, oh, how long are they?

5180
05:50:03,040 --> 05:50:04,320
Yeah.

5181
05:50:04,320 --> 05:50:06,120
I'm like absolutely feasting.

5182
05:50:06,120 --> 05:50:08,440
I've got fruit juice with me.

5183
05:50:08,440 --> 05:50:10,720
I've got a bottle of water.

5184
05:50:10,720 --> 05:50:13,960
I've got a cup of tea with honey in it.

5185
05:50:13,960 --> 05:50:17,640
Like, oh, oh, not again.

5186
05:50:17,640 --> 05:50:20,040
I say, oh, would you stop doing that?

5187
05:50:20,040 --> 05:50:21,600
You're embarrassing me.

5188
05:50:22,520 --> 05:50:24,560
We're driving this controller.

5189
05:50:27,920 --> 05:50:29,920
So I'm gonna like munch and play,

5190
05:50:29,920 --> 05:50:31,320
but I didn't bring any napkins.

5191
05:50:31,320 --> 05:50:33,960
So I might have to suck the egg out of the bowl,

5192
05:50:33,960 --> 05:50:38,960
which sounds bizarre, but can you say the second drink again?

5193
05:50:39,640 --> 05:50:40,960
The fruit juice?

5194
05:50:40,960 --> 05:50:42,840
It's like, it's got mango in it.

5195
05:50:42,840 --> 05:50:44,520
It's like super healthy juice.

5196
05:50:46,520 --> 05:50:48,040
And a cup of tea.

5197
05:50:50,040 --> 05:50:51,520
Wait, you can't, what?

5198
05:50:53,080 --> 05:50:54,520
What, a bottle of water?

5199
05:50:54,520 --> 05:50:55,520
Oh, a bottle of water.

5200
05:50:55,520 --> 05:50:58,840
I didn't say it like the British say it, well,

5201
05:50:58,840 --> 05:51:01,440
I consider the British, the English,

5202
05:51:01,440 --> 05:51:03,480
and the memes like kind of about the English say

5203
05:51:03,480 --> 05:51:04,760
the bottle of water.

5204
05:51:05,920 --> 05:51:07,960
I'm like, oh, I don't know what I'm saying.

5205
05:51:08,960 --> 05:51:11,040
I don't know if I need to slurp this egg

5206
05:51:11,040 --> 05:51:13,760
because I really can't be bothered getting,

5207
05:51:13,760 --> 05:51:14,760
where am I supposed to be going?

5208
05:51:14,760 --> 05:51:16,280
How far away is this location?

5209
05:51:19,840 --> 05:51:21,920
Oh, it's the castle, right?

5210
05:51:21,920 --> 05:51:24,560
I'm gonna try, I'm gonna get rid of this.

5211
05:51:24,560 --> 05:51:26,440
Oh, it says he's a coward though.

5212
05:51:29,000 --> 05:51:31,280
It's really annoying trying to get cowards

5213
05:51:31,280 --> 05:51:33,120
because they actually run away.

5214
05:51:35,520 --> 05:51:37,000
Actually, give me one second.

5215
05:51:37,040 --> 05:51:39,760
My room is on fire because of this PC.

5216
05:51:40,920 --> 05:51:42,440
Literally getting baked.

5217
05:51:54,200 --> 05:51:55,400
Oh, I've been robbed!

5218
05:51:55,400 --> 05:51:58,520
I've looked away for five seconds and I've been robbed!

5219
05:51:58,520 --> 05:52:00,720
Oh, right, I didn't need the money that much.

5220
05:52:01,800 --> 05:52:02,680
It's fine, it's fine, great.

5221
05:52:02,680 --> 05:52:03,640
Let me put my headset on.

5222
05:52:03,640 --> 05:52:06,000
That actually can't hear the gear right now.

5223
05:52:06,000 --> 05:52:08,480
Did he just run up to me and like rob me?

5224
05:52:18,040 --> 05:52:19,800
Not seeing my room's hope,

5225
05:52:19,800 --> 05:52:21,440
but too hope it's just came in through a ring

5226
05:52:21,440 --> 05:52:24,680
and honestly, I'm sweltering.

5227
05:52:24,680 --> 05:52:26,800
I don't know if that's the Scottish word, sweltering.

5228
05:52:26,800 --> 05:52:27,640
Do you see that?

5229
05:52:27,640 --> 05:52:28,480
I'm sweltering.

5230
05:52:29,960 --> 05:52:31,320
Sweating my beets off.

5231
05:52:32,200 --> 05:52:36,160
Although I feel like sweating my beets off

5232
05:52:36,160 --> 05:52:39,640
probably comes from like, is it Mardi Gras?

5233
05:52:39,640 --> 05:52:41,720
Like that party that Americans have

5234
05:52:41,720 --> 05:52:46,720
where you unveil yourself and you get beets as a reward.

5235
05:52:47,440 --> 05:52:49,840
Like I think that's where that saying might've came from

5236
05:52:49,840 --> 05:52:50,680
because that just makes sense.

5237
05:52:50,680 --> 05:52:52,000
Like, oh, I'm sweating my beets off

5238
05:52:52,000 --> 05:52:56,360
because I'm like showing the goods so much and so often.

5239
05:52:57,360 --> 05:53:02,360
Right, where on earth has this got this captain?

5240
05:53:04,360 --> 05:53:05,840
I really don't want to mess it up

5241
05:53:05,840 --> 05:53:09,600
because if you mess it up and he runs away in time,

5242
05:53:09,600 --> 05:53:13,520
you have to wait until the following day.

5243
05:53:13,520 --> 05:53:16,160
Oh, I think I know who this one is.

5244
05:53:16,160 --> 05:53:19,360
I think he, oh, oh, oh, hold on, hold on, hold on.

5245
05:53:19,360 --> 05:53:22,840
No, see, oh, you know the guy that can see you right now?

5246
05:53:22,840 --> 05:53:26,720
I could actually, wait, I can't lock onto him,

5247
05:53:26,720 --> 05:53:27,880
but he can lock onto me.

5248
05:53:27,880 --> 05:53:30,320
See you stinky AI, perish.

5249
05:53:33,200 --> 05:53:35,240
Oh, beets of sweat that come off your head.

5250
05:53:35,240 --> 05:53:38,240
Ooh, you know what?

5251
05:53:39,640 --> 05:53:41,760
Yeah, I know that you said that, that makes more sense.

5252
05:53:41,760 --> 05:53:45,760
Yeah, probably not Mardi Gras really is.

5253
05:53:45,760 --> 05:53:48,280
Okay, I'll pay it, I'm safe.

5254
05:53:48,280 --> 05:53:51,240
Where's, yes, I knew it was this one.

5255
05:53:53,720 --> 05:53:57,200
Do we assassinate him from above, is my question?

5256
05:53:58,200 --> 05:53:59,560
I don't know.

5257
05:54:01,000 --> 05:54:03,800
I normally have three signals at this point,

5258
05:54:03,800 --> 05:54:06,000
which means I can do a raining down effect.

5259
05:54:07,000 --> 05:54:09,440
Did he really say where did I go?

5260
05:54:09,440 --> 05:54:10,280
Gryff.

5261
05:54:11,320 --> 05:54:14,200
Right, if I can air assassinate him,

5262
05:54:14,200 --> 05:54:16,880
this isn't a problem.

5263
05:54:16,880 --> 05:54:19,480
If I can lock onto him, I am very tall

5264
05:54:19,480 --> 05:54:21,160
up to lock onto him though.

5265
05:54:23,840 --> 05:54:27,520
No, wait, no, wait, lock onto him.

5266
05:54:27,520 --> 05:54:29,600
Yeah, uh-huh.

5267
05:54:31,160 --> 05:54:36,160
No, yes, yes, yes, oh, that was so good.

5268
05:54:38,960 --> 05:54:42,000
Oh, and none of the guards want to defend, that's hilarious.

5269
05:54:43,400 --> 05:54:48,240
All the guards are like, that man just came out of the sky.

5270
05:54:48,240 --> 05:54:51,400
We are not, we are retreating right now.

5271
05:54:53,680 --> 05:54:56,720
Does your room have poor ventilation?

5272
05:54:56,720 --> 05:54:58,280
That's horrendous ventilation.

5273
05:55:01,000 --> 05:55:02,840
Unfortunately, I'm renting,

5274
05:55:04,280 --> 05:55:07,120
so I have like absolutely no input

5275
05:55:07,120 --> 05:55:09,760
or like anything I could really do about it.

5276
05:55:09,760 --> 05:55:11,200
Rip in pepperoni.

5277
05:55:15,720 --> 05:55:18,280
He craves the drop, true.

5278
05:55:18,280 --> 05:55:20,560
Okay, I shouldn't get too distracted

5279
05:55:20,560 --> 05:55:22,520
because my tea's gonna get too cold

5280
05:55:22,520 --> 05:55:25,240
and my fruit juice is gonna get too warm.

5281
05:55:26,640 --> 05:55:29,880
I am going to ignite the,

5282
05:55:29,880 --> 05:55:33,520
gotta light this place up and then we're gone, oh.

5283
05:55:37,720 --> 05:55:40,800
You're edging me and not the good kind.

5284
05:55:44,360 --> 05:55:45,480
Are the windows open?

5285
05:55:45,480 --> 05:55:47,760
No, the window's freaking broken.

5286
05:55:47,920 --> 05:55:52,760
Um, like the landlord is being really nice to me

5287
05:55:52,760 --> 05:55:54,320
and he's like left me alone.

5288
05:55:54,320 --> 05:55:56,080
It's not like one of them annoying landlords

5289
05:55:56,080 --> 05:55:58,960
that are like trying to like trail through your place

5290
05:55:58,960 --> 05:56:03,960
all the time, but obviously whenever you visit somewhere

5291
05:56:04,000 --> 05:56:07,240
to rent and you like inspect it,

5292
05:56:07,240 --> 05:56:09,680
you don't actually know what's wrong with the place

5293
05:56:09,680 --> 05:56:13,520
until you move in and like they're obviously,

5294
05:56:13,520 --> 05:56:17,080
I discovered like windows are broken,

5295
05:56:17,080 --> 05:56:20,920
the hot and like cold, I don't know what the word is,

5296
05:56:22,120 --> 05:56:23,840
is not like ideal.

5297
05:56:23,840 --> 05:56:25,720
Are you guys okay if I hide in this hay bale?

5298
05:56:25,720 --> 05:56:29,720
We'll start drink my, oh, I forgot to shake my fruit juice.

5299
05:56:29,720 --> 05:56:32,400
Whoops, that's like real one of having fruit juice.

5300
05:56:32,400 --> 05:56:34,800
Um, I might just drink it real quick.

5301
05:56:34,800 --> 05:56:35,720
I apologize.

5302
05:56:43,840 --> 05:56:45,320
Oh, that shit's so good.

5303
05:56:46,480 --> 05:56:48,520
Yum, yum, yum, yum, yum.

5304
05:56:48,520 --> 05:56:52,320
It's apple, banana, lychee, mango, just smoothie.

5305
05:56:52,320 --> 05:56:54,640
So I'm getting all my fruit in one drink

5306
05:56:54,640 --> 05:56:59,080
because I don't really eat fruit that often.

5307
05:56:59,080 --> 05:57:01,160
I like waste fruit, so I feel bad.

5308
05:57:02,080 --> 05:57:04,120
Oh my God, it's mimosa, mimosa spotted.

5309
05:57:04,120 --> 05:57:04,960
Uh-huh.

5310
05:57:12,880 --> 05:57:14,800
Guys, you'll never guess who I arranged

5311
05:57:14,800 --> 05:57:16,720
an ASMR collab with this morning.

5312
05:57:17,800 --> 05:57:19,520
They've just showed up in chat.

5313
05:57:24,800 --> 05:57:26,880
It's very likely.

5314
05:57:26,880 --> 05:57:30,120
That'll be my first official collab with a VTuber.

5315
05:57:31,640 --> 05:57:33,560
Got Dimp on the list.

5316
05:57:33,560 --> 05:57:35,800
I'm hunting down everyone with radios.

5317
05:57:35,800 --> 05:57:38,720
I'm serious about that goal.

5318
05:57:38,720 --> 05:57:41,200
I'm arranging them all, we'll make it nice and easy.

5319
05:57:41,200 --> 05:57:44,320
Gonna be doing my best, so hopefully you guys eat good

5320
05:57:44,320 --> 05:57:48,720
and you can sleep to my soothing Scottish accent.

5321
05:57:48,720 --> 05:57:50,720
That's right, wee laddie.

5322
05:57:50,720 --> 05:57:52,920
Time to go to sleep.

5323
05:57:52,920 --> 05:57:54,480
Are you tingling?

5324
05:57:54,480 --> 05:57:56,440
Tingle, tingle, tingle.

5325
05:58:00,600 --> 05:58:02,720
Oh my God, she must be so cool to be able to collab with you.

5326
05:58:02,960 --> 05:58:03,800
Ha ha ha ha.

5327
05:58:06,440 --> 05:58:09,640
I should actually do like four Scots accent

5328
05:58:09,640 --> 05:58:11,440
on an ASMR, that would be hilarious.

5329
05:58:14,240 --> 05:58:16,680
I've almost finished my Juicy Just hypotenuse.

5330
05:58:19,800 --> 05:58:20,800
What should I eat first?

5331
05:58:20,800 --> 05:58:21,640
Should I eat an egg?

5332
05:58:21,640 --> 05:58:22,480
I think so.

5333
05:58:24,360 --> 05:58:27,880
I don't really like the idea of eggs sitting out too long.

5334
05:58:27,880 --> 05:58:30,040
Oh, what the fuck?

5335
05:58:30,120 --> 05:58:32,840
To say something was delicious in Scots,

5336
05:58:32,840 --> 05:58:35,760
you say it was braw, and that was braw.

5337
05:58:35,760 --> 05:58:37,520
That drink was delicious.

5338
05:58:40,320 --> 05:58:42,600
You keep mocking your accent.

5339
05:58:42,600 --> 05:58:45,320
Oh, I don't think people find the Scottish accent hot.

5340
05:58:45,320 --> 05:58:47,200
I would say like hot accents,

5341
05:58:47,200 --> 05:58:50,360
like unironically like French Italian

5342
05:58:50,360 --> 05:58:52,360
or normally like rated quite highly.

5343
05:58:53,600 --> 05:58:55,360
I have taken a bite of a meat stick.

5344
05:58:55,360 --> 05:58:58,480
I apologize for anyone who doesn't like eating.

5345
05:58:58,480 --> 05:58:59,320
I need to eat.

5346
05:59:02,560 --> 05:59:06,200
I want you to read Go The Eft Sleep and Your Accent.

5347
05:59:06,200 --> 05:59:07,040
That'd be good.

5348
05:59:10,600 --> 05:59:13,280
Is Valley Girl strongy real?

5349
05:59:13,280 --> 05:59:14,120
Hi, guys.

5350
05:59:16,320 --> 05:59:19,560
I'm so totally excited to be here.

5351
05:59:20,760 --> 05:59:24,680
Yeah, I'm Valley Girl, I laugh at everything.

5352
05:59:26,120 --> 05:59:27,720
Yeah, that's the best you can.

5353
05:59:28,720 --> 05:59:29,560
Yeah, you like that?

5354
05:59:29,560 --> 05:59:30,880
Is that what you want?

5355
05:59:31,920 --> 05:59:32,760
I'm scared.

5356
05:59:34,840 --> 05:59:36,440
I want to perish.

5357
05:59:37,360 --> 05:59:39,440
Valley Girl's strongy, say in it, brav.

5358
05:59:40,480 --> 05:59:42,520
Can you do a Scottish Valley Girl?

5359
05:59:46,120 --> 05:59:48,000
No, I don't think so.

5360
05:59:50,800 --> 05:59:53,360
No, I don't think so.

5361
05:59:53,360 --> 05:59:54,600
I didn't think so.

5362
05:59:54,600 --> 05:59:58,400
No, my brain is like unable to compute what I need to do

5363
05:59:58,400 --> 06:00:02,440
in order to keep the accent, but make it different.

5364
06:00:03,560 --> 06:00:04,400
Brain kind of it.

5365
06:00:06,440 --> 06:00:09,840
You're not hypnotizing us Scottish accents at all.

5366
06:00:11,960 --> 06:00:13,080
I'm eating the meat.

5367
06:00:13,080 --> 06:00:15,000
I am now baiting the egg.

5368
06:00:15,000 --> 06:00:16,080
I'm just going to touch it.

5369
06:00:20,800 --> 06:00:22,520
I just said fucking delicious.

5370
06:00:24,560 --> 06:00:27,120
I have erned, oh my God.

5371
06:00:27,120 --> 06:00:29,200
A bite of the egg and the meat at the same time.

5372
06:00:29,200 --> 06:00:30,400
I have earned this, okay?

5373
06:00:30,400 --> 06:00:31,320
I have earned this.

5374
06:00:31,320 --> 06:00:32,160
Ah.

5375
06:00:38,560 --> 06:00:39,960
Is I almost choking on it?

5376
06:00:39,960 --> 06:00:42,160
Hey, ho, there's a first time for everything.

5377
06:00:45,240 --> 06:00:47,520
It's like a pepper ramy if you're a British.

5378
06:00:47,520 --> 06:00:49,840
I don't know what the equivalent is in America

5379
06:00:49,840 --> 06:00:52,760
or it's a twizy stick in Australia.

5380
06:00:54,040 --> 06:00:56,160
Xio is literally, he's like, I need to rest.

5381
06:00:56,200 --> 06:00:57,480
I'll be not at this for hours.

5382
06:00:57,480 --> 06:00:59,480
He's sleeping in the hay.

5383
06:01:05,800 --> 06:01:08,560
Oh, my mouth opens when my mouth.

5384
06:01:11,320 --> 06:01:13,160
Ah, that's cool.

5385
06:01:17,000 --> 06:01:19,040
Like my mouth is closed right now,

5386
06:01:19,040 --> 06:01:24,040
but because my mouth opens, well, yeah.

5387
06:01:24,880 --> 06:01:26,200
Ba, ba, ba, ba.

5388
06:01:26,200 --> 06:01:27,040
Sorry, sorry.

5389
06:01:30,160 --> 06:01:32,360
A slim gym, probably.

5390
06:01:41,640 --> 06:01:46,640
Would you like some sweet chili pea snack

5391
06:01:47,880 --> 06:01:49,120
that's been baked?

5392
06:01:54,120 --> 06:01:54,960
Ow.

5393
06:02:06,280 --> 06:02:07,440
Okay, open up.

5394
06:02:13,640 --> 06:02:15,680
I hope you guys stretched.

5395
06:02:17,440 --> 06:02:18,680
Because if you haven't stretched,

5396
06:02:18,680 --> 06:02:21,800
that's you sat for six hours and you're supposed to stretch.

5397
06:02:22,800 --> 06:02:24,120
If anyone's in a wheelchair,

5398
06:02:24,120 --> 06:02:26,080
you're exempt from these instructions.

5399
06:02:37,080 --> 06:02:39,800
I stretched all my limbs, this is good.

5400
06:02:42,480 --> 06:02:44,200
You're not going to fall for that one stare.

5401
06:02:44,200 --> 06:02:46,480
Well, you're going to split, aren't you?

5402
06:02:46,480 --> 06:02:47,800
Ah, stare.

5403
06:02:48,640 --> 06:02:53,240
Oh, my God, I don't know if I can read that out.

5404
06:02:55,560 --> 06:02:57,240
When is booty inspection day?

5405
06:03:01,440 --> 06:03:04,720
A faint sound of munching emanates from the car.

5406
06:03:04,720 --> 06:03:05,720
Hum, hum, hum, hum.

5407
06:03:08,160 --> 06:03:13,160
I've got sweet chili pea snacks that are baked.

5408
06:03:14,000 --> 06:03:16,920
Two meat sticks and two eggs,

5409
06:03:16,920 --> 06:03:19,000
and I've got one meat and egg left,

5410
06:03:19,000 --> 06:03:20,760
and I'm just munching on the peas.

5411
06:03:25,680 --> 06:03:26,840
Oh, my God.

5412
06:03:27,880 --> 06:03:31,360
So for years, I had no idea what Charlie Horse meant.

5413
06:03:35,480 --> 06:03:37,600
It's just called a pulled muscle.

5414
06:03:38,440 --> 06:03:43,440
And I was like, what on earth is a Charlie Horse?

5415
06:03:43,440 --> 06:03:46,520
Like, is this a famous horse named Charlie?

5416
06:03:46,520 --> 06:03:48,120
Why is it happening to people?

5417
06:03:48,120 --> 06:03:50,000
That's not possible.

5418
06:03:50,000 --> 06:03:52,360
I was like, it's crazy.

5419
06:03:52,360 --> 06:03:53,640
And then I finally figured it out

5420
06:03:53,640 --> 06:03:57,680
because I watched a meme and the guy fell over

5421
06:03:57,680 --> 06:04:00,600
and he was like, ah, ah, Charlie Horse.

5422
06:04:00,600 --> 06:04:02,440
And because of his body language,

5423
06:04:02,440 --> 06:04:04,520
my brain was like, oh, my God,

5424
06:04:04,520 --> 06:04:06,680
he's having a muscle spasm.

5425
06:04:06,720 --> 06:04:08,280
That's what it means.

5426
06:04:09,280 --> 06:04:12,360
Like, oh, I need a burp.

5427
06:04:12,360 --> 06:04:14,520
I'm so sorry, I'm eating, so it means a burp a lot.

5428
06:04:14,520 --> 06:04:16,600
I'm jammy, if you don't like it.

5429
06:04:20,720 --> 06:04:24,400
I don't think a zero or a mercy burp.

5430
06:04:24,400 --> 06:04:25,840
I think they have manners

5431
06:04:25,840 --> 06:04:28,480
and weren't raised in a barn like me.

5432
06:04:29,480 --> 06:04:30,480
Mm-mm, mm-mm.

5433
06:04:36,040 --> 06:04:38,840
I was named after Sir Charles of Horse.

5434
06:04:41,840 --> 06:04:43,320
Ooh, money.

5435
06:04:43,320 --> 06:04:45,280
We've got 3,000 in the bank right now.

5436
06:04:47,360 --> 06:04:50,160
Some say that Charlie's still in pain to this day.

5437
06:04:51,080 --> 06:04:52,400
Was that a meme on Family Guy?

5438
06:04:52,400 --> 06:04:53,800
I don't know what it was.

5439
06:04:53,800 --> 06:04:56,720
No, those ones are the difference.

5440
06:04:56,720 --> 06:04:58,080
I learned from Mercy the other day

5441
06:04:58,080 --> 06:04:59,680
that saying be there, be square

5442
06:04:59,680 --> 06:05:01,160
is because you won't be around.

5443
06:05:03,120 --> 06:05:03,960
Wait, what?

5444
06:05:05,000 --> 06:05:09,200
Be there or be square is because you won't be around.

5445
06:05:10,880 --> 06:05:15,680
Oh, that's so smart.

5446
06:05:15,680 --> 06:05:20,560
Like, around in a circle, yeah?

5447
06:05:20,560 --> 06:05:22,640
And like, you won't be around in the area

5448
06:05:22,640 --> 06:05:25,000
if you're not there, because you're a square.

5449
06:05:26,040 --> 06:05:27,960
Yeah, oh, I just got that too.

5450
06:05:27,960 --> 06:05:29,560
That's good, I like that.

5451
06:05:29,560 --> 06:05:31,320
Mercy smart.

5452
06:05:31,320 --> 06:05:33,440
Shawnee, it's not manners, it's your cuttlebone.

5453
06:05:33,440 --> 06:05:34,960
You're just in to boil and say,

5454
06:05:34,960 --> 06:05:36,920
yes, this is my first time on land.

5455
06:05:37,760 --> 06:05:38,800
Sometimes.

5456
06:05:40,760 --> 06:05:41,760
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

5457
06:05:47,440 --> 06:05:49,240
Careful, you don't want to make me too smart.

5458
06:05:49,240 --> 06:05:51,760
I'll start coming up when you names Fond de la Buse...

5459
06:05:52,720 --> 06:05:54,640
I'm never gonna live down Fond de la Buse

5460
06:05:54,640 --> 06:05:55,480
when we sucky.

5461
06:05:58,720 --> 06:06:01,880
What marshmallow did you want to see Anthony spit at that?

5462
06:06:01,880 --> 06:06:03,080
Oh, I didn't open up the marshmallows.

5463
06:06:03,080 --> 06:06:04,840
Well, we do it at the end of stream,

5464
06:06:04,840 --> 06:06:06,000
because we're actually really close

5465
06:06:06,000 --> 06:06:08,040
to finishing the game, like, really close.

5466
06:06:10,160 --> 06:06:11,000
Mm-hmm.

5467
06:06:14,200 --> 06:06:15,040
Mm-hmm.

5468
06:06:16,960 --> 06:06:19,480
Alright, you better be scared of me cooking again.

5469
06:06:24,120 --> 06:06:25,120
Yum-yum-yum-yum.

5470
06:06:27,960 --> 06:06:28,800
Mm-hmm.

5471
06:06:36,960 --> 06:06:37,800
Mm-hmm.

5472
06:06:39,840 --> 06:06:42,920
Uh, I'm sorry, but I'm gonna suck my fingers.

5473
06:06:42,920 --> 06:06:44,120
I know some people don't like it,

5474
06:06:44,120 --> 06:06:46,360
matter-wise, but I don't have an napkin.

5475
06:06:46,360 --> 06:06:47,200
Eh.

5476
06:06:48,920 --> 06:06:49,760
Eh.

5477
06:06:50,800 --> 06:06:52,720
That reminds me, I need to make the audio.

5478
06:06:52,720 --> 06:06:54,040
Eh.

5479
06:06:54,040 --> 06:06:54,880
Mm-hmm.

5480
06:06:56,720 --> 06:06:57,560
Mm-hmm.

5481
06:06:58,960 --> 06:06:59,800
Mm-hmm.

5482
06:06:59,800 --> 06:07:00,920
Okay.

5483
06:07:00,920 --> 06:07:03,000
I inhaled the meat and the egg,

5484
06:07:03,000 --> 06:07:04,080
and then I finished my tea,

5485
06:07:04,080 --> 06:07:05,080
and then we're gonna get straight back

5486
06:07:05,080 --> 06:07:05,920
and finish this stuff.

5487
06:07:05,920 --> 06:07:06,760
Ah.

5488
06:07:09,200 --> 06:07:10,040
Mm-hmm.

5489
06:07:11,960 --> 06:07:13,600
Yum-yum-yum.

5490
06:07:13,600 --> 06:07:15,360
This is a really good combo.

5491
06:07:16,480 --> 06:07:19,480
I need to, like, more charcuterie snack stuff

5492
06:07:19,480 --> 06:07:21,480
for longer streams,

5493
06:07:21,480 --> 06:07:23,840
because I don't have time to actually make food.

5494
06:07:25,320 --> 06:07:26,160
Mm-hmm.

5495
06:07:28,960 --> 06:07:33,960
Maybe in a cold pasta dish,

5496
06:07:34,000 --> 06:07:35,200
I can pre-make.

5497
06:07:36,720 --> 06:07:39,560
The crunchy thing is the meat stick.

5498
06:07:39,560 --> 06:07:41,960
It's got, like, a skin on it, eh.

5499
06:07:41,960 --> 06:07:44,200
I don't know, mm-hmm.

5500
06:07:44,200 --> 06:07:45,040
That's the meat.

5501
06:07:48,080 --> 06:07:48,920
Mm-hmm.

5502
06:07:53,480 --> 06:07:57,560
I've got protein from the egg,

5503
06:07:57,560 --> 06:08:00,680
and protein from the meat and fats,

5504
06:08:01,720 --> 06:08:04,320
and the pea snacks are carbohydrates.

5505
06:08:06,000 --> 06:08:07,000
Ah.

5506
06:08:07,000 --> 06:08:07,840
Ah.

5507
06:08:12,520 --> 06:08:13,520
Yum-yum-yum.

5508
06:08:13,520 --> 06:08:15,240
I'm gonna get tons of hydration.

5509
06:08:17,440 --> 06:08:19,920
That's way too crunchy to be, it is meat!

5510
06:08:20,920 --> 06:08:22,760
It is meat, I promise you, it's meat.

5511
06:08:22,760 --> 06:08:25,320
It's, like, an outer skin, like a pepper ramy.

5512
06:08:27,840 --> 06:08:30,720
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

5513
06:08:30,720 --> 06:08:32,480
Okay, all the food is finished.

5514
06:08:32,480 --> 06:08:33,320
Yippee!

5515
06:08:34,520 --> 06:08:36,440
I'm now for the tea.

5516
06:08:36,440 --> 06:08:37,280
Ah.

5517
06:08:39,080 --> 06:08:39,920
Um.

5518
06:08:41,280 --> 06:08:42,240
Honestly,

5519
06:08:43,960 --> 06:08:45,880
depending on how fast we go,

5520
06:08:45,880 --> 06:08:49,360
we might actually finish the campaign in less than two hours,

5521
06:08:49,360 --> 06:08:51,120
but I'm quite happy to, like, fart about

5522
06:08:51,120 --> 06:08:54,440
and do the Borgia Towers after, maybe, like,

5523
06:08:54,440 --> 06:08:56,000
so we can, like, streamline tomorrow

5524
06:08:56,000 --> 06:08:58,280
for doing the DNA sequence run.

5525
06:09:01,200 --> 06:09:02,040
Mm.

5526
06:09:06,320 --> 06:09:07,880
Ah.

5527
06:09:07,880 --> 06:09:09,960
I'm gonna let a big burp, I'm sorry.

5528
06:09:11,720 --> 06:09:13,880
Oh, that was good.

5529
06:09:13,880 --> 06:09:15,400
That was such good food.

5530
06:09:15,400 --> 06:09:17,640
I really needed that, and I hit the spot.

5531
06:09:20,560 --> 06:09:23,240
A battered Mars four-hand count stream.

5532
06:09:23,240 --> 06:09:24,640
It's a honey tea.

5533
06:09:26,000 --> 06:09:26,840
I'm sorry.

5534
06:09:26,840 --> 06:09:29,920
It all comes back up, I've got you.

5535
06:09:29,920 --> 06:09:33,440
I was gonna record Isomar, like, your girlfriend

5536
06:09:33,440 --> 06:09:35,160
for, like, forgets to turn off the mic,

5537
06:09:35,160 --> 06:09:36,880
so it was just me munching and crunching,

5538
06:09:36,880 --> 06:09:38,800
because some people, like, really enjoy,

5539
06:09:38,800 --> 06:09:41,080
like, other people's, like, munching sounds.

5540
06:09:41,080 --> 06:09:43,480
I'm, like, if you are telling me

5541
06:09:43,480 --> 06:09:45,720
that I can order McDonald's

5542
06:09:47,120 --> 06:09:49,000
and eat it on the mic,

5543
06:09:49,000 --> 06:09:51,800
and people would, like, be happy with that,

5544
06:09:51,800 --> 06:09:54,320
like, uh, you don't gotta tell me twice.

5545
06:09:54,520 --> 06:09:55,360
Oh.

5546
06:09:56,840 --> 06:09:57,960
Shawnee, if you're looking for a snack

5547
06:09:57,960 --> 06:10:00,560
that's easy to prepare, grapes.

5548
06:10:00,560 --> 06:10:01,880
I can't believe it.

5549
06:10:01,880 --> 06:10:05,800
I can't believe you're telling me to eat healthy

5550
06:10:05,800 --> 06:10:07,880
and look after myself.

5551
06:10:07,880 --> 06:10:08,720
Oh.

5552
06:10:10,400 --> 06:10:12,000
Cruel world.

5553
06:10:12,000 --> 06:10:13,960
Honey tea, you boil those per beat?

5554
06:10:13,960 --> 06:10:15,800
No!

5555
06:10:15,800 --> 06:10:17,360
I love the bees.

5556
06:10:17,360 --> 06:10:20,880
I get to, um, buy my honey from, like,

5557
06:10:21,880 --> 06:10:23,320
a, like, smaller shop,

5558
06:10:23,320 --> 06:10:26,680
and I like supporting them on their own, like.

5559
06:10:26,680 --> 06:10:27,840
Right, I sip my tea.

5560
06:10:29,680 --> 06:10:31,560
Oh, yeah, I can't, that was roasting.

5561
06:10:31,560 --> 06:10:33,560
It's still quite warm, not gonna lie.

5562
06:10:33,560 --> 06:10:35,040
I thought it was gonna cool.

5563
06:10:35,040 --> 06:10:36,040
Be a bit cooler.

5564
06:10:36,040 --> 06:10:36,880
Uh.

5565
06:10:39,320 --> 06:10:40,920
I'm okay, I'm okay, though.

5566
06:10:40,920 --> 06:10:44,480
Right, we're gonna go and get our wand taken off of us.

5567
06:10:46,880 --> 06:10:49,120
Right, we'll put that on the Herald.

5568
06:10:49,120 --> 06:10:50,720
Thank you very much.

5569
06:10:51,720 --> 06:10:52,560
Yuck.

5570
06:10:53,680 --> 06:10:56,080
You're about to stand in some serious meta.

5571
06:10:58,480 --> 06:10:59,800
Chicken nuggets ASMR.

5572
06:10:59,800 --> 06:11:00,640
Ooh.

5573
06:11:02,960 --> 06:11:06,280
Is 100, does eating 100 chicken nuggets still a challenge?

5574
06:11:07,720 --> 06:11:09,760
I feel like you starve me

5575
06:11:09,760 --> 06:11:12,920
and I could probably do that, like, in one go.

5576
06:11:16,440 --> 06:11:18,480
Have I bought this bank over here?

5577
06:11:18,480 --> 06:11:20,160
I haven't!

5578
06:11:20,160 --> 06:11:22,240
Investments, people, investments.

5579
06:11:24,400 --> 06:11:25,720
That reminds me several years ago,

5580
06:11:25,720 --> 06:11:28,960
back when Tumblr was an important platform

5581
06:11:28,960 --> 06:11:30,760
that some vegans actually thought bees

5582
06:11:30,760 --> 06:11:33,000
were physical harm for their honey.

5583
06:11:33,000 --> 06:11:33,840
Oh.

5584
06:11:33,840 --> 06:11:34,680
I mean.

5585
06:11:36,320 --> 06:11:39,520
Um, vegans just doing their thing, it's fine.

5586
06:11:39,520 --> 06:11:41,920
They're nice, I guess.

5587
06:11:43,320 --> 06:11:45,120
I just, yeah.

5588
06:11:45,120 --> 06:11:45,960
Vegans are vegans.

5589
06:11:46,680 --> 06:11:49,840
I completely understand, like, the stance,

5590
06:11:49,840 --> 06:11:52,000
like, no one actually wants any animals

5591
06:11:52,000 --> 06:11:54,080
to be hurt or all that jazz.

5592
06:11:54,080 --> 06:11:57,720
I just, you know, I ask,

5593
06:11:57,720 --> 06:11:59,840
have you ever seen a healthy-looking vegan

5594
06:11:59,840 --> 06:12:02,600
when they're like, I've been vegan for five years?

5595
06:12:02,600 --> 06:12:04,120
They look ill.

5596
06:12:04,120 --> 06:12:05,880
I had a close family member

5597
06:12:05,880 --> 06:12:10,120
that was temporarily vegan for a couple of years.

5598
06:12:10,120 --> 06:12:14,520
And when they finally started to eat, meet again,

5599
06:12:14,600 --> 06:12:16,560
they were, like, healthy overnight.

5600
06:12:16,560 --> 06:12:17,640
I'm so sorry.

5601
06:12:17,640 --> 06:12:19,200
I apologize if anyone is a vegan here,

5602
06:12:19,200 --> 06:12:21,760
but please seriously take your supplements,

5603
06:12:21,760 --> 06:12:23,000
look at what you need to,

5604
06:12:23,000 --> 06:12:24,240
in order to get what you need,

5605
06:12:24,240 --> 06:12:26,960
because please, please be careful.

5606
06:12:26,960 --> 06:12:28,120
It's very dangerous.

5607
06:12:28,120 --> 06:12:31,080
I don't, I'm actually being serious for, like,

5608
06:12:31,080 --> 06:12:33,080
for one millisecond.

5609
06:12:33,080 --> 06:12:34,400
It is incredibly dangerous

5610
06:12:34,400 --> 06:12:36,640
to genuinely choose to be a vegan.

5611
06:12:36,640 --> 06:12:40,360
And a lot of people don't realize, until it's too late,

5612
06:12:40,360 --> 06:12:42,600
that, like, you are,

5613
06:12:45,360 --> 06:12:48,720
like, if you really want to get into it,

5614
06:12:48,720 --> 06:12:50,840
like, there's the caveman times

5615
06:12:50,840 --> 06:12:52,640
before we discovered what cooking,

5616
06:12:52,640 --> 06:12:54,720
what cooked meat could do for us.

5617
06:12:54,720 --> 06:12:56,720
And, like, it's like, you know,

5618
06:12:56,720 --> 06:13:00,000
once humans had access to cooked meat,

5619
06:13:00,000 --> 06:13:02,520
the brain power of humans, like, went up.

5620
06:13:02,520 --> 06:13:04,360
I can't remember what all the details

5621
06:13:04,360 --> 06:13:05,640
and what it's called and all that,

5622
06:13:05,640 --> 06:13:07,400
but, like, this is what I've been taught,

5623
06:13:07,400 --> 06:13:08,840
and, like, I genuinely believe it.

5624
06:13:08,840 --> 06:13:10,640
I'm sorry, but if you've ever looked at vegan,

5625
06:13:10,640 --> 06:13:12,720
they just look like a husk of a human.

5626
06:13:12,720 --> 06:13:15,520
And I'm so sorry if it's offensively.

5627
06:13:15,520 --> 06:13:17,600
It's just my opinion, but I never said I was smart.

5628
06:13:17,600 --> 06:13:19,320
And my opinions don't reflect the agency.

5629
06:13:19,320 --> 06:13:21,080
I'm sorry, love you, bye.

5630
06:13:21,080 --> 06:13:22,840
I'll stop talking.

5631
06:13:22,840 --> 06:13:23,800
I'll stop talking.

5632
06:13:23,800 --> 06:13:26,240
Okay, this, uh, Borgia district,

5633
06:13:26,240 --> 06:13:28,360
you have to scale it from the rooftops.

5634
06:13:28,360 --> 06:13:29,680
It is impossible.

5635
06:13:29,680 --> 06:13:31,920
You have to do it via AroStorm.

5636
06:13:33,320 --> 06:13:35,360
If you do not do it via AroStorm,

5637
06:13:35,360 --> 06:13:37,520
you're just, like, hurting yourself.

5638
06:13:37,520 --> 06:13:38,740
Like, it is so bad.

5639
06:13:40,080 --> 06:13:42,320
And you can get a flag on the way, so.

5640
06:13:43,160 --> 06:13:46,040
So, literally, drop down AroStorm instantly.

5641
06:13:47,160 --> 06:13:48,320
And just let that done.

5642
06:13:49,400 --> 06:13:50,480
Easiest.

5643
06:13:50,480 --> 06:13:52,560
Literally, you don't even annoy any other guards

5644
06:13:52,560 --> 06:13:53,600
that are in the vicinity.

5645
06:13:53,600 --> 06:13:56,120
There is no one on the rooftops.

5646
06:13:56,120 --> 06:13:58,560
As long as you have AroStorm unlocked,

5647
06:13:58,560 --> 06:14:01,120
which is what the, um,

5648
06:14:02,400 --> 06:14:04,000
which is what the three recruits,

5649
06:14:04,000 --> 06:14:06,400
so you need six previous Borgia towers destroyed

5650
06:14:06,400 --> 06:14:08,880
in order to get that, but once you've got it,

5651
06:14:08,880 --> 06:14:12,000
then you're smooth sailing through the game.

5652
06:14:13,640 --> 06:14:15,880
If only Leafs had protein.

5653
06:14:15,880 --> 06:14:20,640
Yes, I know deeper green-colored veg tablels

5654
06:14:20,640 --> 06:14:23,480
are, like, really, really good in general.

5655
06:14:23,480 --> 06:14:25,040
What way am I to go?

5656
06:14:25,040 --> 06:14:26,920
That looks too big for me to...

5657
06:14:26,920 --> 06:14:28,320
Yeah, I don't have a glove yet.

5658
06:14:28,320 --> 06:14:30,520
Okay, this looks like the way I need to go.

5659
06:14:31,320 --> 06:14:33,480
Mm, mm, mm, mm, mm.

5660
06:14:35,040 --> 06:14:38,360
Did anyone get their, what was it?

5661
06:14:38,360 --> 06:14:39,800
What's that organ that blows up

5662
06:14:39,800 --> 06:14:41,720
that was used for grass eating?

5663
06:14:41,760 --> 06:14:43,040
Like, it literally kills you.

5664
06:14:43,040 --> 06:14:44,920
I'll always forget the name of it.

5665
06:14:44,920 --> 06:14:46,000
An appendix?

5666
06:14:46,000 --> 06:14:48,360
Did anyone get their appendixes removed?

5667
06:14:49,600 --> 06:14:51,080
Ooh.

5668
06:14:51,080 --> 06:14:53,880
Did you get wrecked with your appendix?

5669
06:14:55,840 --> 06:14:57,080
Okay, tea time.

5670
06:14:59,600 --> 06:15:01,560
Rice and beans.

5671
06:15:01,560 --> 06:15:02,840
Can cover you for the most.

5672
06:15:02,840 --> 06:15:03,680
Yeah.

5673
06:15:07,440 --> 06:15:09,400
Yours burst?

5674
06:15:10,320 --> 06:15:13,720
Oh, you must have been deathly ill.

5675
06:15:13,720 --> 06:15:16,720
If it bursts, it can result in death,

5676
06:15:16,720 --> 06:15:19,360
because it's just straight poison to your organs.

5677
06:15:19,360 --> 06:15:20,640
Holy crap.

5678
06:15:20,640 --> 06:15:22,880
Someone said my tonsils grew y-

5679
06:15:22,880 --> 06:15:25,120
They stole your tonsils?

5680
06:15:25,120 --> 06:15:26,640
Oh, give them back.

5681
06:15:29,880 --> 06:15:31,760
I thought appendixes were forbill-

5682
06:15:31,760 --> 06:15:32,600
I thought append-

5683
06:15:32,600 --> 06:15:35,200
I got some appendixes was for when we used to eat,

5684
06:15:35,200 --> 06:15:38,320
like, grass, grass, like, back in the old day.

5685
06:15:38,360 --> 06:15:39,520
I'm taking a sip of tea.

5686
06:15:39,520 --> 06:15:41,640
I'm gonna try and finish up my apology.

5687
06:15:44,640 --> 06:15:45,800
Ah, your gallbladder?

5688
06:15:45,800 --> 06:15:46,640
I'm scared.

5689
06:15:46,640 --> 06:15:48,520
My mom had a gallbladder issue.

5690
06:15:48,520 --> 06:15:50,040
And so did my gran.

5691
06:15:50,040 --> 06:15:53,040
Genetically, I am predispositioned.

5692
06:15:53,040 --> 06:15:54,320
Like, one day on stream,

5693
06:15:54,320 --> 06:15:56,920
I'm just gonna start like screaming and being like,

5694
06:15:56,920 --> 06:15:59,520
gallbladder, gallbladder!

5695
06:16:00,480 --> 06:16:03,720
But, uh, hopefully that doesn't actually happen.

5696
06:16:03,720 --> 06:16:06,200
But I can't say I'm the healthiest being around.

5697
06:16:08,920 --> 06:16:10,160
You can die of death.

5698
06:16:10,160 --> 06:16:12,080
Did I say that?

5699
06:16:12,080 --> 06:16:13,080
You can die of death.

5700
06:16:18,040 --> 06:16:19,600
I don't wish that pain.

5701
06:16:19,600 --> 06:16:22,160
Wait, you know how you guys are guys?

5702
06:16:23,160 --> 06:16:27,040
Have you guys ever passed the kidney stone?

5703
06:16:28,800 --> 06:16:30,640
For anyone who drinks an energy drink,

5704
06:16:30,640 --> 06:16:31,880
have you passed the kidney stone?

5705
06:16:31,880 --> 06:16:33,000
Yes or no?

5706
06:16:33,000 --> 06:16:34,320
I'm very interested in that.

5707
06:16:34,320 --> 06:16:35,160
I wanna know.

5708
06:16:36,000 --> 06:16:37,280
Never, maybe?

5709
06:16:37,280 --> 06:16:39,760
Did you ever really sort of pee-pee at one time?

5710
06:16:39,760 --> 06:16:42,160
We are not 100% what it is used for.

5711
06:16:42,160 --> 06:16:44,240
These range from filtration,

5712
06:16:44,240 --> 06:16:47,640
to breaking down fiber, to appendix, to a mystery organ.

5713
06:16:47,640 --> 06:16:48,880
That's so cool!

5714
06:16:48,880 --> 06:16:50,040
Like, how do we not know?

5715
06:16:50,040 --> 06:16:51,680
We've got so much history.

5716
06:16:51,680 --> 06:16:52,520
No.

5717
06:16:55,080 --> 06:16:55,920
I hope I don't.

5718
06:16:55,920 --> 06:16:56,760
Yeah, it sucks.

5719
06:16:56,760 --> 06:16:57,600
Ooh!

5720
06:17:00,400 --> 06:17:03,080
I've heard stories from Whammon.

5721
06:17:03,440 --> 06:17:05,200
I've heard stories from Whammon

5722
06:17:05,200 --> 06:17:06,760
that are like, I've had a kidney stone

5723
06:17:06,760 --> 06:17:07,640
and I've had a baby.

5724
06:17:07,640 --> 06:17:09,800
I'd rather, you know, do the baby again.

5725
06:17:09,800 --> 06:17:11,880
And I'm like, hey, see?

5726
06:17:11,880 --> 06:17:14,440
That's biology in play.

5727
06:17:14,440 --> 06:17:19,440
Did you know the brain actually tells Whammon

5728
06:17:19,440 --> 06:17:22,120
that they're birth of their...

5729
06:17:22,120 --> 06:17:24,280
Wait, where the heck am I going?

5730
06:17:24,280 --> 06:17:26,560
Can I climb up here without the glove?

5731
06:17:26,560 --> 06:17:29,400
I don't think I can climb up here without the glove.

5732
06:17:29,400 --> 06:17:30,240
Climb?

5733
06:17:30,240 --> 06:17:31,240
No?

5734
06:17:31,240 --> 06:17:32,160
Okay, I can, I can.

5735
06:17:32,200 --> 06:17:33,040
Jesus.

5736
06:17:33,040 --> 06:17:35,720
I was like, oh, I've just missed out.

5737
06:17:35,720 --> 06:17:37,520
I love stronticolors and I heard,

5738
06:17:37,520 --> 06:17:39,040
heart kidney stone perils!

5739
06:17:39,040 --> 06:17:40,560
Oh my God!

5740
06:17:40,560 --> 06:17:41,680
I do have peril.

5741
06:17:41,680 --> 06:17:44,240
I have a peril in a very special location.

5742
06:17:45,760 --> 06:17:47,040
Are you there, Mercy?

5743
06:17:47,040 --> 06:17:48,680
Are you streaming later?

5744
06:17:48,680 --> 06:17:52,040
Are you streaming in one hour, two hour?

5745
06:17:52,960 --> 06:17:55,680
Three hour, Mercy stream, question mark.

5746
06:17:58,400 --> 06:18:00,400
I'm finishing my team, please pardon me.

5747
06:18:03,160 --> 06:18:05,160
I need a burp, it's like stuck in my throat.

5748
06:18:10,160 --> 06:18:12,160
I have finished my team.

5749
06:18:14,160 --> 06:18:15,160
Requiem.

5750
06:18:16,160 --> 06:18:18,160
Requiem, cadavante.

5751
06:18:18,160 --> 06:18:20,160
Okay, whee!

5752
06:18:28,160 --> 06:18:29,160
It's Azura.

5753
06:18:30,160 --> 06:18:32,160
Is Azura?

5754
06:18:32,160 --> 06:18:34,160
Is Mama Azu streaming in the day?

5755
06:18:34,160 --> 06:18:36,160
Wait, where the heck am I today?

5756
06:18:37,160 --> 06:18:38,160
Sounds like I need to go up here.

5757
06:18:38,160 --> 06:18:41,160
Oh, that's because I do need to go up here.

5758
06:18:44,160 --> 06:18:47,160
Only energy drink I've had is Calcius.

5759
06:18:47,160 --> 06:18:48,160
Calesus?

5760
06:18:48,160 --> 06:18:49,160
What?

5761
06:18:49,160 --> 06:18:51,160
C-E-L.

5762
06:18:51,160 --> 06:18:52,160
Celsius.

5763
06:18:52,160 --> 06:18:53,160
Celsius.

5764
06:18:53,160 --> 06:18:54,160
Oh.

5765
06:18:54,160 --> 06:18:56,160
I got there in the end.

5766
06:18:56,160 --> 06:18:58,160
I got there in the end.

5767
06:18:59,160 --> 06:19:01,160
You just gotta let me cook on some words, okay?

5768
06:19:01,160 --> 06:19:03,160
Some words are like, huh?

5769
06:19:03,160 --> 06:19:04,160
Huh?

5770
06:19:05,160 --> 06:19:07,160
And then you just gotta have full,

5771
06:19:07,160 --> 06:19:09,160
netically spell them out.

5772
06:19:09,160 --> 06:19:11,160
Everyone is streaming right now.

5773
06:19:11,160 --> 06:19:13,160
Oh my god, overlapping corp, I can't believe it.

5774
06:19:15,160 --> 06:19:18,160
I literally tell everyone like, go watch everyone else stream

5775
06:19:18,160 --> 06:19:20,160
because I'm literally just sitting doing like an

5776
06:19:20,160 --> 06:19:22,160
endurance eight hour stream type thing.

5777
06:19:22,160 --> 06:19:24,160
I'm just having a blast.

5778
06:19:24,160 --> 06:19:25,160
Yeah.

5779
06:19:25,160 --> 06:19:27,160
But don't worry when you go live in Mercy,

5780
06:19:27,160 --> 06:19:30,160
I always recommend to the girls, please, to go.

5781
06:19:30,160 --> 06:19:33,160
No, I always recommend to the brief links

5782
06:19:33,160 --> 06:19:37,160
to give you a chance and check you out.

5783
06:19:37,160 --> 06:19:41,160
See, we work because odds are I'm still going to be streaming

5784
06:19:41,160 --> 06:19:42,160
by the time you...

5785
06:19:42,160 --> 06:19:45,160
Oh, I wasn't supposed to be discovered.

5786
06:19:46,160 --> 06:19:48,160
Oh well, so we over...

5787
06:19:48,160 --> 06:19:49,160
It's fine.

5788
06:19:49,160 --> 06:19:50,160
We're doing it to...

5789
06:19:50,160 --> 06:19:51,160
Look at that.

5790
06:19:51,160 --> 06:19:52,160
Look at that.

5791
06:19:52,160 --> 06:19:53,160
Combat cam.

5792
06:19:53,160 --> 06:19:54,160
Combat cam.

5793
06:19:55,160 --> 06:19:56,160
Ooh.

5794
06:19:56,160 --> 06:19:58,160
Is that Azura live right now with that link?

5795
06:19:58,160 --> 06:19:59,160
Or is that Imi?

5796
06:19:59,160 --> 06:20:01,160
Or is that just everyone's link altogether?

5797
06:20:01,160 --> 06:20:03,160
Silence discord mode.

5798
06:20:03,160 --> 06:20:04,160
Oh, you're not discord mode at all.

5799
06:20:04,160 --> 06:20:05,160
YouTube mode.

5800
06:20:05,160 --> 06:20:06,160
I'm just kidding.

5801
06:20:06,160 --> 06:20:07,160
Thank you for moderating for free.

5802
06:20:07,160 --> 06:20:08,160
I really appreciate it.

5803
06:20:08,160 --> 06:20:11,160
Actually, all the girls really do appreciate it because

5804
06:20:12,160 --> 06:20:14,160
it's kind of like one of those like jobs,

5805
06:20:14,160 --> 06:20:17,160
you know, like the silent, unrecognized work,

5806
06:20:17,160 --> 06:20:19,160
but I actually genuinely like thank you to everyone

5807
06:20:19,160 --> 06:20:21,160
who like applied to be a mod,

5808
06:20:21,160 --> 06:20:23,160
and like thank you for everyone just being like

5809
06:20:23,160 --> 06:20:25,160
cool at the mods and all that shiz.

5810
06:20:27,160 --> 06:20:28,160
Really appreciate that.

5811
06:20:28,160 --> 06:20:31,160
But then again, silence, YouTube mode.

5812
06:20:32,160 --> 06:20:34,160
With all that said, and all due respect.

5813
06:20:36,160 --> 06:20:38,160
Oh, I'm just getting spotted by everyone.

5814
06:20:38,160 --> 06:20:39,160
Reisa, we're just in a big fight.

5815
06:20:41,160 --> 06:20:42,160
Oh no, they have guns.

5816
06:20:44,160 --> 06:20:45,160
Calling their assassins.

5817
06:20:45,160 --> 06:20:46,160
Calling their assassins.

5818
06:20:48,160 --> 06:20:49,160
Okay, I'm not dealing with them all.

5819
06:20:49,160 --> 06:20:50,160
You can kill them all.

5820
06:20:51,160 --> 06:20:52,160
I'm not dealing with them.

5821
06:20:53,160 --> 06:20:54,160
Whoa, they literally...

5822
06:20:56,160 --> 06:20:58,160
Is he gonna see me entering the castle?

5823
06:20:58,160 --> 06:20:59,160
I think I may.

5824
06:20:59,160 --> 06:21:00,160
I simply have all...

5825
06:21:01,160 --> 06:21:03,160
You tell the girls to watch the girls.

5826
06:21:03,160 --> 06:21:04,160
No, I said it wrong.

5827
06:21:04,160 --> 06:21:05,160
I said it wrong.

5828
06:21:05,160 --> 06:21:06,160
They do it for free.

5829
06:21:06,160 --> 06:21:07,160
I mean, literally.

5830
06:21:08,160 --> 06:21:10,160
Azura and Emmy are...

5831
06:21:10,160 --> 06:21:11,160
Azura is online as well.

5832
06:21:11,160 --> 06:21:15,160
Oh, if there are any Azura Dulay,

5833
06:21:15,160 --> 06:21:17,160
she is officially online as well.

5834
06:21:17,160 --> 06:21:19,160
If you're an Azura Dulay, watch her.

5835
06:21:19,160 --> 06:21:21,160
I ordered a fresh batch of la Catorre la last night.

5836
06:21:21,160 --> 06:21:23,160
Oh, so no one has tasted my Catorre.

5837
06:21:24,160 --> 06:21:25,160
But the Pope has taken it all.

5838
06:21:25,160 --> 06:21:26,160
Where is the Pope?

5839
06:21:26,160 --> 06:21:27,160
He meets with Cesare.

5840
06:21:28,160 --> 06:21:29,160
Strange.

5841
06:21:29,160 --> 06:21:30,160
He did not tell me.

5842
06:21:30,160 --> 06:21:31,160
Cesare had returned.

5843
06:21:31,160 --> 06:21:32,160
Imagine being a Mortarader.

5844
06:21:33,160 --> 06:21:34,160
Imagine...

5845
06:21:35,160 --> 06:21:36,160
Okay.

5846
06:21:36,160 --> 06:21:37,160
Now what?

5847
06:21:38,160 --> 06:21:40,160
Sorry, I'm starting to lose that little bit.

5848
06:21:40,160 --> 06:21:42,160
I was like, imagine being a Mortarader.

5849
06:21:42,160 --> 06:21:43,160
Okay, now what happens?

5850
06:21:44,160 --> 06:21:45,160
Danny, did anything else?

5851
06:21:46,160 --> 06:21:47,160
I'm imagining.

5852
06:21:47,160 --> 06:21:49,160
With my mind only, I'm imagining.

5853
06:21:52,160 --> 06:21:54,160
Okay, I'm getting a bit delirious.

5854
06:21:54,160 --> 06:21:55,160
I think it's like...

5855
06:21:56,160 --> 06:21:58,160
Bro, I know I said this yesterday.

5856
06:21:58,160 --> 06:22:00,160
We were so delirious during that group collab.

5857
06:22:00,160 --> 06:22:04,160
But I'm so excited for our official group game collab together.

5858
06:22:04,160 --> 06:22:06,160
I hope you guys like the intro.

5859
06:22:06,160 --> 06:22:09,160
I'm going to script it when we start up the streams.

5860
06:22:11,160 --> 06:22:14,160
And literally, everyone's going to be streaming it.

5861
06:22:15,160 --> 06:22:18,160
So you can see all six POVs at once.

5862
06:22:22,160 --> 06:22:23,160
Oh, I'm burping away.

5863
06:22:25,160 --> 06:22:27,160
You've been at this for six hours.

5864
06:22:28,160 --> 06:22:29,160
Honestly.

5865
06:22:33,160 --> 06:22:35,160
You, come here so I can assassinate you.

5866
06:22:36,160 --> 06:22:37,160
That's right.

5867
06:22:37,160 --> 06:22:38,160
Come closer.

5868
06:22:38,160 --> 06:22:39,160
I can sense thine penis.

5869
06:22:40,160 --> 06:22:41,160
Okay, sorry.

5870
06:22:41,160 --> 06:22:42,160
I shouldn't have said that.

5871
06:22:42,160 --> 06:22:43,160
I like that.

5872
06:22:45,160 --> 06:22:47,160
I think I'm actually doing the same thing a little bit.

5873
06:22:48,160 --> 06:22:49,160
But hey, hope.

5874
06:22:49,160 --> 06:22:50,160
It's not just life.

5875
06:22:51,160 --> 06:22:52,160
Let's go.

5876
06:22:54,160 --> 06:22:56,160
Oh, I don't know why I said that.

5877
06:22:56,160 --> 06:22:58,160
I'm remembering just like, hee hee.

5878
06:22:58,160 --> 06:22:59,160
Oh, I'm notorious.

5879
06:23:00,160 --> 06:23:02,160
I didn't lure my notoriety.

5880
06:23:04,160 --> 06:23:05,160
Oh, it sucks.

5881
06:23:06,160 --> 06:23:07,160
I almost got caught.

5882
06:23:07,160 --> 06:23:09,160
Well, actually, it doesn't really matter if I get caught by him.

5883
06:23:09,160 --> 06:23:10,160
He doesn't come.

5884
06:23:13,160 --> 06:23:15,160
How do you not see me?

5885
06:23:15,160 --> 06:23:16,160
I'm literally on a bookcase.

5886
06:23:16,160 --> 06:23:17,160
I'm doing the ballard.

5887
06:23:18,160 --> 06:23:19,160
Okay.

5888
06:23:22,160 --> 06:23:24,160
God, he's so armored out the world.

5889
06:23:26,160 --> 06:23:28,160
I have something on my mind.

5890
06:23:28,160 --> 06:23:32,160
Look, all I'm saying is that the marshmallows have been having a good time on marshmallows.

5891
06:23:34,160 --> 06:23:35,160
Oh, whips.

5892
06:23:35,160 --> 06:23:36,160
I wasn't supposed to jump down.

5893
06:23:36,160 --> 06:23:37,160
Hail.

5894
06:23:37,160 --> 06:23:38,160
Whoopsie.

5895
06:23:38,160 --> 06:23:43,160
Oh, I'm getting in trouble.

5896
06:23:43,160 --> 06:23:47,160
I don't remember all these enemies being here.

5897
06:23:47,160 --> 06:23:50,160
I'm going to have to remember when I'm doing the, like, do not be detected.

5898
06:23:50,160 --> 06:23:54,160
Like, you put that away.

5899
06:23:54,160 --> 06:23:56,160
Literally diddle-dee-dee.

5900
06:23:56,160 --> 06:23:58,160
And I shall first get wrecked.

5901
06:23:59,160 --> 06:24:02,160
This town ain't big enough for the both of us.

5902
06:24:02,160 --> 06:24:03,160
Cowboy.

5903
06:24:03,160 --> 06:24:04,160
Oh, that's 6,000.

5904
06:24:05,160 --> 06:24:07,160
We're getting so near the end of the game.

5905
06:24:09,160 --> 06:24:10,160
What has happened here?

5906
06:24:10,160 --> 06:24:11,160
I do not know what you mean.

5907
06:24:11,160 --> 06:24:12,160
I want to take.

5908
06:24:12,160 --> 06:24:13,160
I take.

5909
06:24:15,160 --> 06:24:17,160
If I want you to die.

5910
06:24:17,160 --> 06:24:18,160
You.

5911
06:24:18,160 --> 06:24:19,160
Even those with an army.

5912
06:24:19,160 --> 06:24:21,160
You intend to give me money?

5913
06:24:22,160 --> 06:24:24,160
No, I do not.

5914
06:24:24,160 --> 06:24:27,160
Then I will use the piece of Eden to get what I want.

5915
06:24:27,160 --> 06:24:29,160
Your help is not necessary.

5916
06:24:31,160 --> 06:24:33,160
That has been made abundantly to me.

5917
06:24:35,160 --> 06:24:36,160
That says dad.

5918
06:24:36,160 --> 06:24:40,160
Are you aware that the Baron de Valois is dead?

5919
06:24:40,160 --> 06:24:41,160
No.

5920
06:24:41,160 --> 06:24:42,160
Did you?

5921
06:24:42,160 --> 06:24:44,160
What reason could I possibly have to kill him?

5922
06:24:45,160 --> 06:24:50,160
Was he plotting against me with my brilliant, treacherous captain general?

5923
06:24:50,160 --> 06:24:52,160
I do not have to stand for this.

5924
06:24:53,160 --> 06:24:55,160
The assassins murdered him.

5925
06:24:55,160 --> 06:24:57,160
Why did you not stop them?

5926
06:24:57,160 --> 06:24:59,160
As if I could.

5927
06:24:59,160 --> 06:25:02,160
It was not my decision to attack Monteriggione.

5928
06:25:02,160 --> 06:25:03,160
It was yours.

5929
06:25:04,160 --> 06:25:05,160
Shh.

5930
06:25:06,160 --> 06:25:09,160
It is high time you took responsibilities for your actions.

5931
06:25:09,160 --> 06:25:11,160
My accomplishments.

5932
06:25:11,160 --> 06:25:15,160
Despite the constant interference of failures like you.

5933
06:25:17,160 --> 06:25:19,160
You are not going anywhere.

5934
06:25:20,160 --> 06:25:21,160
I have the piece.

5935
06:25:21,160 --> 06:25:22,160
Out of my way, old man.

5936
06:25:24,160 --> 06:25:26,160
Get out of my way, old man.

5937
06:25:28,160 --> 06:25:31,160
I gave you everything and yet it's never enough.

5938
06:25:31,160 --> 06:25:34,160
Cesare, he intends to poison you.

5939
06:25:40,160 --> 06:25:42,160
You have not listened to reason.

5940
06:25:43,160 --> 06:25:46,160
Father, do you not see?

5941
06:25:47,160 --> 06:25:50,160
I can control all of this.

5942
06:25:52,160 --> 06:25:55,160
If I want to live, I live.

5943
06:25:55,160 --> 06:25:59,160
If I want to take, I take.

5944
06:26:01,160 --> 06:26:06,160
And if I want you to die, you die.

5945
06:26:07,160 --> 06:26:09,160
It's so good.

5946
06:26:09,160 --> 06:26:12,160
Where is the piece of Eden?

5947
06:26:12,160 --> 06:26:14,160
I know where it is.

5948
06:26:14,160 --> 06:26:17,160
And you did not tell me he had taken it.

5949
06:26:17,160 --> 06:26:20,160
Cesare, it's me, your queen.

5950
06:26:22,160 --> 06:26:23,160
You are my sister.

5951
06:26:23,160 --> 06:26:24,160
None more.

5952
06:26:26,160 --> 06:26:27,160
Where is it?

5953
06:26:27,160 --> 06:26:28,160
You never loved me?

5954
06:26:28,160 --> 06:26:30,160
You never loved me?

5955
06:26:30,160 --> 06:26:32,160
Where is the apple?

5956
06:26:32,160 --> 06:26:33,160
Tell me.

5957
06:26:38,160 --> 06:26:40,160
The voice acting is so good.

5958
06:26:40,160 --> 06:26:42,160
Tell me.

5959
06:26:43,160 --> 06:26:44,160
Tell me.

5960
06:26:47,160 --> 06:26:49,160
It's just so good.

5961
06:26:49,160 --> 06:26:52,160
It's just so good.

5962
06:26:52,160 --> 06:26:55,160
Thank you for letting me share this game with you.

5963
06:26:55,160 --> 06:26:57,160
Fun fact, you don't need to hurt anyone.

5964
06:26:57,160 --> 06:26:59,160
Oh, no, no, go over, Etsy.

5965
06:27:01,160 --> 06:27:02,160
Etsy.

5966
06:27:02,160 --> 06:27:04,160
Oh, you're giving me a heart attack.

5967
06:27:04,160 --> 06:27:05,160
Etsy.

5968
06:27:05,160 --> 06:27:07,160
Oh, Etsy.

5969
06:27:07,160 --> 06:27:09,160
Oh, you're giving me a heart attack.

5970
06:27:09,160 --> 06:27:10,160
Little sister.

5971
06:27:10,160 --> 06:27:11,160
I know.

5972
06:27:11,160 --> 06:27:12,160
I know.

5973
06:27:12,160 --> 06:27:14,160
Fucking hell, I was having a heart attack.

5974
06:27:14,160 --> 06:27:15,160
Do you see that?

5975
06:27:15,160 --> 06:27:16,160
They're related?

5976
06:27:16,160 --> 06:27:18,160
Yeah, it's based on history.

5977
06:27:20,160 --> 06:27:21,160
I could see.

5978
06:27:23,160 --> 06:27:25,160
No, where that bastard is going.

5979
06:27:25,160 --> 06:27:26,160
San Pietro.

5980
06:27:27,160 --> 06:27:29,160
The pavilion in the courtyard.

5981
06:27:29,160 --> 06:27:31,160
The pavilion in the courtyard.

5982
06:27:31,160 --> 06:27:32,160
Hmm.

5983
06:27:37,160 --> 06:27:39,160
Exit through the front gate.

5984
06:27:39,160 --> 06:27:41,160
Wait, am I still going to get attacked by guards?

5985
06:27:41,160 --> 06:27:42,160
Oh, oh, wrong way.

5986
06:27:42,160 --> 06:27:43,160
Etsy.

5987
06:27:43,160 --> 06:27:46,160
You've just got such a big palace.

5988
06:27:48,160 --> 06:27:50,160
I'll come back for you later.

5989
06:27:51,160 --> 06:27:52,160
See you later.

5990
06:27:52,160 --> 06:27:54,160
I'll come for you later.

5991
06:27:54,160 --> 06:27:55,160
See you later.

5992
06:27:55,160 --> 06:27:56,160
Like this.

5993
06:27:59,160 --> 06:28:00,160
Assassino.

5994
06:28:04,160 --> 06:28:06,160
I will come for you.

5995
06:28:06,160 --> 06:28:07,160
Wait.

5996
06:28:07,160 --> 06:28:08,160
Later.

5997
06:28:09,160 --> 06:28:11,160
I'll come for you later.

5998
06:28:15,160 --> 06:28:16,160
I just like doing that.

5999
06:28:19,160 --> 06:28:20,160
Reefling.

6000
06:28:20,160 --> 06:28:21,160
Reefling.

6001
06:28:21,160 --> 06:28:23,160
I'll come back for you later.

6002
06:28:23,160 --> 06:28:24,160
Later.

6003
06:28:24,160 --> 06:28:26,160
I'll come back for you later.

6004
06:28:26,160 --> 06:28:27,160
Yes, I will.

6005
06:28:27,160 --> 06:28:29,160
Who's a good Reefling?

6006
06:28:29,160 --> 06:28:31,160
Have you been a good boy?

6007
06:28:31,160 --> 06:28:33,160
Is it time for your daily milky-wilky?

6008
06:28:37,160 --> 06:28:38,160
Oopsies.

6009
06:28:38,160 --> 06:28:39,160
Oopsies.

6010
06:28:39,160 --> 06:28:40,160
Oopsies.

6011
06:28:40,160 --> 06:28:41,160
Wait, he was in my way.

6012
06:28:41,160 --> 06:28:43,160
Am I supposed to just ignore him?

6013
06:28:43,160 --> 06:28:44,160
I think I am.

6014
06:28:44,160 --> 06:28:46,160
I will remember that for when we redo the mission.

6015
06:28:48,160 --> 06:28:49,160
Spiral scare.

6016
06:28:49,160 --> 06:28:50,160
Right.

6017
06:28:50,160 --> 06:28:55,160
So that you can grab this box because the timer don't start until now.

6018
06:28:55,160 --> 06:29:00,160
You have to leg it for this entire next section.

6019
06:29:00,160 --> 06:29:01,160
Okay?

6020
06:29:01,160 --> 06:29:03,160
You have to do it for the entire next day.

6021
06:29:03,160 --> 06:29:07,160
Fucking let's go.

6022
06:29:07,160 --> 06:29:08,160
Well, you're stuck in the cutscene.

6023
06:29:08,160 --> 06:29:09,160
Give it a second.

6024
06:29:09,160 --> 06:29:10,160
Let it cook.

6025
06:29:10,160 --> 06:29:11,160
Let it cook.

6026
06:29:11,160 --> 06:29:12,160
Let's go.

6027
06:29:12,160 --> 06:29:13,160
Don't worry.

6028
06:29:13,160 --> 06:29:14,160
Leave a faith.

6029
06:29:14,160 --> 06:29:15,160
Leave a faith.

6030
06:29:15,160 --> 06:29:16,160
Don't worry.

6031
06:29:16,160 --> 06:29:17,160
Don't worry.

6032
06:29:17,160 --> 06:29:18,160
Leave a faith.

6033
06:29:18,160 --> 06:29:19,160
Promise.

6034
06:29:19,160 --> 06:29:20,160
Promise.

6035
06:29:20,160 --> 06:29:21,160
Ta-da.

6036
06:29:21,160 --> 06:29:22,160
See?

6037
06:29:22,160 --> 06:29:23,160
It's right there.

6038
06:29:23,160 --> 06:29:29,160
And then if you go in the street of the pavilion, it's the easiest way to navigate to the place.

6039
06:29:29,160 --> 06:29:30,160
Okay?

6040
06:29:30,160 --> 06:29:32,160
And then you need to do the jump thing.

6041
06:29:32,160 --> 06:29:33,160
Jump.

6042
06:29:33,160 --> 06:29:36,160
And then just take the main street all the way up to the pavilion.

6043
06:29:36,160 --> 06:29:40,160
And just jump every time you see an agility at the bottom of your screen.

6044
06:29:40,160 --> 06:29:41,160
You just jump.

6045
06:29:41,160 --> 06:29:42,160
And they can't get you.

6046
06:29:42,160 --> 06:29:43,160
Jump.

6047
06:29:43,160 --> 06:29:44,160
See?

6048
06:29:44,160 --> 06:29:46,160
The AI unclogs you.

6049
06:29:46,160 --> 06:29:47,160
Jump.

6050
06:29:47,160 --> 06:29:48,160
Jump.

6051
06:29:48,160 --> 06:29:49,160
Jump.

6052
06:29:49,160 --> 06:29:54,160
And then you'll be perfectly fine.

6053
06:29:54,160 --> 06:29:55,160
Jump.

6054
06:29:55,160 --> 06:29:57,160
Now you might have to fight them at the end.

6055
06:29:57,160 --> 06:30:03,160
I honestly don't understand what the development team actually wanted from you at this point.

6056
06:30:03,160 --> 06:30:04,160
Please leave me alone.

6057
06:30:04,160 --> 06:30:07,160
But oh, he almost touched me.

6058
06:30:07,160 --> 06:30:08,160
He touched my ankle.

6059
06:30:08,160 --> 06:30:09,160
Oh, he's touching me.

6060
06:30:09,160 --> 06:30:11,160
He's touching me.

6061
06:30:11,160 --> 06:30:12,160
Okay.

6062
06:30:12,160 --> 06:30:14,160
And then they opened up.

6063
06:30:14,160 --> 06:30:16,160
And then we just go inside.

6064
06:30:16,160 --> 06:30:20,160
And then sometimes you may have to come outside and fight, but it's okay.

6065
06:30:20,160 --> 06:30:22,160
It's okay.

6066
06:30:22,160 --> 06:30:23,160
Okay.

6067
06:30:23,160 --> 06:30:24,160
So we were...

6068
06:30:24,160 --> 06:30:29,160
That's a lot of bad guys.

6069
06:30:29,160 --> 06:30:30,160
No.

6070
06:30:30,160 --> 06:30:31,160
Okay.

6071
06:30:31,160 --> 06:30:32,160
We got one.

6072
06:30:32,160 --> 06:30:33,160
Oh.

6073
06:30:33,160 --> 06:30:35,160
Oh, I'm getting ganged on.

6074
06:30:35,160 --> 06:30:36,160
I'm getting ganged up.

6075
06:30:36,160 --> 06:30:37,160
I don't like it.

6076
06:30:37,160 --> 06:30:38,160
Take this.

6077
06:30:38,160 --> 06:30:39,160
And this.

6078
06:30:39,160 --> 06:30:40,160
And this.

6079
06:30:40,160 --> 06:30:41,160
And this.

6080
06:30:41,160 --> 06:30:42,160
And this.

6081
06:30:42,160 --> 06:30:43,160
And this.

6082
06:30:43,160 --> 06:30:44,160
And this.

6083
06:30:44,160 --> 06:30:45,160
And this.

6084
06:30:45,160 --> 06:30:46,160
Okay.

6085
06:30:46,160 --> 06:30:53,160
Unfortunately we are in range because of that yellow on the map, but we might be able to

6086
06:30:53,160 --> 06:30:54,160
stand here.

6087
06:30:54,160 --> 06:31:00,160
It should time out because they're not supposed to actually see us.

6088
06:31:00,160 --> 06:31:01,160
There we go.

6089
06:31:01,160 --> 06:31:02,160
There we go.

6090
06:31:02,160 --> 06:31:06,160
Now, did you guys remember the pineapple?

6091
06:31:07,160 --> 06:31:10,160
Did you remember the pineapple?

6092
06:31:10,160 --> 06:31:13,160
We did a little eagle vision.

6093
06:31:13,160 --> 06:31:16,160
The pineapple is glowing.

6094
06:31:22,160 --> 06:31:24,160
I was right there.

6095
06:31:24,160 --> 06:31:25,160
What?

6096
06:31:25,160 --> 06:31:27,160
I was there all along.

6097
06:31:27,160 --> 06:31:29,160
Excuse me?

6098
06:31:29,160 --> 06:31:31,160
Looking for this.

6099
06:31:31,160 --> 06:31:32,160
Don't kill us, Sino.

6100
06:31:32,160 --> 06:31:40,160
My sword will take your life.

6101
06:31:40,160 --> 06:31:43,160
Hydration.

6102
06:31:43,160 --> 06:31:45,160
Wow.

6103
06:31:45,160 --> 06:31:48,160
Those armor clinking sounds.

6104
06:31:48,160 --> 06:31:50,160
Good sound effect.

6105
06:31:50,160 --> 06:31:51,160
Guards.

6106
06:31:51,160 --> 06:31:52,160
Guards.

6107
06:31:52,160 --> 06:31:54,520
Oh, Chasary.

6108
06:31:54,520 --> 06:31:57,160
Your time can't last.

6109
06:31:57,160 --> 06:32:00,560
Not while I come in with the apple.

6110
06:32:00,560 --> 06:32:04,040
Okay, so basically just run

6111
06:32:05,520 --> 06:32:09,180
Wait hold on let me let me open the map. Sorry to bring down the energy

6112
06:32:09,180 --> 06:32:12,280
I need to open the map because I always forget which direction I need to go in

6113
06:32:12,500 --> 06:32:17,680
So I need to keep going dead ahead and then take a right. Okay. Let's go

6114
06:32:23,040 --> 06:32:29,600
It is just a waste of time trying to stop and hurt like get rid of all these enemies

6115
06:32:30,560 --> 06:32:36,760
There's no point. So just outrun them until you get to the water and swim like your life depends on it

6116
06:32:36,760 --> 06:32:38,760
They keep they jump in me

6117
06:32:39,760 --> 06:32:41,760
Get off

6118
06:32:41,760 --> 06:32:43,600
Get off

6119
06:32:43,600 --> 06:32:45,600
Away naughty

6120
06:32:46,400 --> 06:32:51,760
No, if you follow this street, I think it takes you to the water. Oh

6121
06:32:53,360 --> 06:32:57,180
I don't like those brute guys. They're actually pretty strong. Oh

6122
06:32:58,180 --> 06:33:00,180
Oh

6123
06:33:05,780 --> 06:33:13,940
When the moon hits your high like a big piece of pie that's a morning

6124
06:33:17,820 --> 06:33:20,920
Bills will ring ring a ding a ding

6125
06:33:21,920 --> 06:33:23,920
Pizza

6126
06:33:25,600 --> 06:33:27,600
And that's how you get away from that sequence

6127
06:33:28,560 --> 06:33:35,320
Jump on that boat and get out of there. You do not have to attack anyone. You do not have to eliminate any enemies

6128
06:33:35,840 --> 06:33:38,600
Jump in that boat and you are safe

6129
06:33:42,880 --> 06:33:44,880
Oh

6130
06:33:50,920 --> 06:33:54,480
To assemble his remaining support coming weeks

6131
06:33:56,000 --> 06:33:58,000
When the moon hits your eye, that's a strongy

6132
06:34:04,680 --> 06:34:11,560
It's blinding odd my models not reactive to what happens on screen and he put that back on I love that

6133
06:34:11,680 --> 06:34:13,680
That was like the funniest thing

6134
06:34:16,480 --> 06:34:18,480
My eyes

6135
06:34:19,480 --> 06:34:23,600
We do have no a right a sight to see us down

6136
06:34:28,920 --> 06:34:30,920
Flashbang

6137
06:34:32,560 --> 06:34:37,880
I think for the loser guards and touch the pineapple without hurting anyone just pop a smoke bomb and getting a crowded bench

6138
06:34:37,880 --> 06:34:43,480
I wonder that may be the solution. They are everywhere and nowhere at once

6139
06:34:43,480 --> 06:34:45,480
I

6140
06:34:46,680 --> 06:34:50,440
We cannot on our own senior you must help us. I am

6141
06:34:52,600 --> 06:34:54,600
Idiot

6142
06:34:55,600 --> 06:34:59,400
And then you will see how quickly the assassini fall

6143
06:35:02,080 --> 06:35:04,080
Delude yourself Chesere

6144
06:35:04,600 --> 06:35:06,600
Oh

6145
06:35:10,800 --> 06:35:13,240
Right so the apple is a bit funny

6146
06:35:13,240 --> 06:35:20,080
Do you see that white one that white line means imminent death the yellow means under my control

6147
06:35:21,400 --> 06:35:22,960
and

6148
06:35:22,960 --> 06:35:26,040
So we want to basically the apple will take your health

6149
06:35:26,040 --> 06:35:28,040
so I have to wait until it restores and

6150
06:35:28,600 --> 06:35:34,800
Then wait and then it kills the people who we want to kill and then the others are either under my control

6151
06:35:34,800 --> 06:35:38,560
Or we'll fight for me. It's a bit finicky, but once you learn it you get it

6152
06:35:42,000 --> 06:35:45,360
We're teleporting all over the map. We're at the blooming

6153
06:35:46,640 --> 06:35:48,440
Rose

6154
06:35:48,440 --> 06:35:50,440
Yes

6155
06:35:52,720 --> 06:35:54,720
Under stress

6156
06:35:54,960 --> 06:36:00,760
Any anyone else under stress and we're feeling about a key need not a bit of a

6157
06:36:02,600 --> 06:36:04,600
I'm not gonna say it's too easy too easy

6158
06:36:09,480 --> 06:36:14,400
So the point of Assassin's Creed is to get rid of the apples of Eden, however

6159
06:36:15,800 --> 06:36:17,800
It's always a good good boy and

6160
06:36:18,480 --> 06:36:20,120
his

6161
06:36:20,120 --> 06:36:23,200
DNA communes with the apple so his bloodline

6162
06:36:23,800 --> 06:36:25,800
Kind of has been chosen

6163
06:36:26,520 --> 06:36:32,160
I'm pretty sure the guys around this corner actually and I've gone too far. Yeah, there is and

6164
06:36:34,840 --> 06:36:36,840
Feel the cardinal

6165
06:36:37,400 --> 06:36:40,200
He I think he just runs down this hill and then that's it

6166
06:36:40,400 --> 06:36:45,640
You do not have access to your recruits at this time, but you don't need it because you literally have the apple Eden

6167
06:36:45,640 --> 06:36:51,680
I will say one thing the more. Oh, no, actually it doesn't affect with the more armor you have

6168
06:36:52,680 --> 06:36:58,400
Also on the weapon wheel, you can't select anything when you hold the apple of Eden, but I won't even let you take it out

6169
06:37:05,840 --> 06:37:08,400
So we just need to follow him into the coliseum

6170
06:37:10,320 --> 06:37:18,080
Okay, no, no, I'm not here. Uh-uh. No, uh-uh. You didn't see me. No. Oh, you're actually a liar

6171
06:37:18,680 --> 06:37:23,320
And and I will you you guards just spawned in

6172
06:37:24,120 --> 06:37:26,320
Don't lie. You just spawned in rain in front of me

6173
06:37:27,600 --> 06:37:29,600
as a see

6174
06:37:31,640 --> 06:37:33,640
And a cup

6175
06:37:34,840 --> 06:37:38,560
You won't find me because I'm not what you need

6176
06:37:39,480 --> 06:37:41,000
I'm

6177
06:37:41,000 --> 06:37:43,840
Your end maker caretaker

6178
06:37:44,480 --> 06:37:58,000
My bikini ever has to be mentioned enough. It wasn't I've unbended everything so there's no chance of accident or bikini show

6179
06:37:58,000 --> 06:38:00,000
I apologize

6180
06:38:00,240 --> 06:38:02,240
Borja money has become tainted

6181
06:38:04,440 --> 06:38:06,440
Main control apple

6182
06:38:07,120 --> 06:38:09,120
I

6183
06:38:13,360 --> 06:38:15,360
Okay, again same thing

6184
06:38:15,520 --> 06:38:22,640
Unfortunately, this is very awkward and you can call in your recruits, but it's not very good at all. I'm try

6185
06:38:23,040 --> 06:38:25,040
Okay, this isn't working wait

6186
06:38:25,880 --> 06:38:31,320
He attacked me and he died. Did you see that right? I'm just calling in my recruits. They're not very strong, but

6187
06:38:32,320 --> 06:38:38,480
We'll try we'll try I don't normally like doing it because recruits can definitely die at this section

6188
06:38:38,920 --> 06:38:42,200
because of the overwhelming amount of enemies that

6189
06:38:42,800 --> 06:38:47,320
Letting enemies that come in but again white mark around who you would wish to

6190
06:38:48,000 --> 06:38:51,520
Eliminate right off the bat and hopefully my assassin recruits stay around

6191
06:38:52,920 --> 06:38:57,360
So he's coming straight for me. So once I've healed up again

6192
06:38:57,960 --> 06:39:01,560
You just need to do the white you can also see the white line on their

6193
06:39:02,680 --> 06:39:06,600
The horse knocked him out of range. So we'll need to try that one again

6194
06:39:07,640 --> 06:39:09,640
So they're now fighting each other

6195
06:39:11,360 --> 06:39:13,360
Again white line

6196
06:39:13,520 --> 06:39:14,760
Got him

6197
06:39:14,760 --> 06:39:17,680
Yeah, see my assassin recruits are getting damaged on their health

6198
06:39:17,680 --> 06:39:21,720
I really do not enjoy calling them in on this mission. It is dangerous

6199
06:39:21,720 --> 06:39:26,240
You can lose recruits here if they're not leveled up enough. I really did not spend much

6200
06:39:27,360 --> 06:39:29,000
Where's the apple?

6201
06:39:29,000 --> 06:39:31,600
Whoa, he's like slow mo getting me

6202
06:39:32,280 --> 06:39:36,040
Okay, we've got two more to go two more to go let him get up let him get up

6203
06:39:37,640 --> 06:39:42,960
But go for him first cuz you actually know we won't cuz my assassin recruit just did that. Oh

6204
06:39:43,800 --> 06:39:48,800
Someone's load not good. Not good. This is why I really don't like I really don't want anyone to perish

6205
06:39:49,560 --> 06:39:51,560
Oh

6206
06:39:53,160 --> 06:39:57,440
Did he survive I didn't get a notification saying that one passed away. I

6207
06:39:59,280 --> 06:40:04,240
Know you much of an ASMR enjoyer, but any change your mind. That's fantastic

6208
06:40:05,280 --> 06:40:09,800
I like you. You just got to find someone that fits your groove and they can interest you into something new

6209
06:40:10,840 --> 06:40:16,480
Johnny miss ma. How are you doing? Have you been good?

6210
06:40:18,920 --> 06:40:20,920
Mmm-hmm

6211
06:40:21,240 --> 06:40:24,160
We playing assassin's creed up in this house

6212
06:40:25,960 --> 06:40:32,160
We're literally about to finish the game after an amazing gaming session you can ignore the guards here the

6213
06:40:32,800 --> 06:40:35,400
Campaign should take over once you approach these

6214
06:40:37,560 --> 06:40:41,960
So very good another time me. Did you stream today or have you streamed yet?

6215
06:40:44,280 --> 06:40:46,280
Are you taking break today?

6216
06:40:46,680 --> 06:40:49,800
I mean ASMR was great. It does all

6217
06:40:56,920 --> 06:41:02,920
So now we get our cool Avengers moment where everyone's with us helping us and

6218
06:41:04,040 --> 06:41:06,040
You can actually

6219
06:41:06,720 --> 06:41:10,280
Successfully kill all everyone in this sequence

6220
06:41:11,240 --> 06:41:17,040
Oh, I can't use my mouse. I can't use my blades. I'm so used to using them

6221
06:41:17,840 --> 06:41:24,640
You're still playing absolutely. We're just about to finish the campaign. I'm so excited. Oh, no, that recruit so low

6222
06:41:24,640 --> 06:41:35,200
Oh, I feel like I need to help them. Oh, okay. Okay. Good catch. Good catch. Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no

6223
06:41:36,000 --> 06:41:39,240
I'm dead. I only have one HP. Oh

6224
06:41:40,280 --> 06:41:43,800
I need it to reach in. No, I don't want any assassins to fall

6225
06:41:44,440 --> 06:41:52,240
Stop attacking her. Stop. I don't have health to freaking use the apple. Please gang up on him. Thank you. My goodness. Oh

6226
06:41:53,440 --> 06:41:55,440
No, oh

6227
06:41:55,480 --> 06:41:57,480
Please okay yellow. Oh

6228
06:41:59,800 --> 06:42:01,800
Someone's gonna pass away

6229
06:42:04,520 --> 06:42:08,200
Okay, so we just finished

6230
06:42:09,040 --> 06:42:10,320
Oh

6231
06:42:10,320 --> 06:42:12,320
No one perished

6232
06:42:12,320 --> 06:42:18,120
Oh, that was so lucky. So we've now finished the sequence and we're all waiting

6233
06:42:19,400 --> 06:42:21,400
All five of us avenger style

6234
06:42:21,400 --> 06:42:23,200
On your own

6235
06:42:23,200 --> 06:42:28,600
We can let us troops must behind me. We will take back my city

6236
06:42:29,920 --> 06:42:36,240
This is not your city anymore by order of Pope Julius second. I arrest you

6237
06:42:36,240 --> 06:42:41,720
They are crime on the crimes of murder betrayal and incest

6238
06:42:42,120 --> 06:42:47,320
No, no, no, no, no, this is not how it ends

6239
06:42:47,680 --> 06:42:52,680
James will not hold me. I will not die by the hands of man

6240
06:42:59,320 --> 06:43:01,320
Was the manner in which he said it

6241
06:43:04,240 --> 06:43:07,000
Didn't know that was a crime back then honestly

6242
06:43:08,360 --> 06:43:09,960
true

6243
06:43:09,960 --> 06:43:13,800
question marks because all we hear about bloodlines is

6244
06:43:14,240 --> 06:43:17,840
You know about Royals and that so was it like

6245
06:43:18,360 --> 06:43:23,800
Royals are allowed to do it, but the common people aren't allowed to do it. You know as peasants

6246
06:43:25,560 --> 06:43:27,560
I cannot risk it

6247
06:43:32,480 --> 06:43:34,480
I must go

6248
06:43:36,440 --> 06:43:43,080
Jezary was right. I have to leave when I'm usually my people need me build this brotherhood to last with or without me

6249
06:43:44,760 --> 06:43:46,760
Plant a seed

6250
06:43:46,800 --> 06:43:48,800
Plot plant a seed

6251
06:43:50,160 --> 06:43:52,160
Then keep your money

6252
06:43:52,680 --> 06:43:56,480
We will see each other again. You have my bonafortuna

6253
06:44:01,240 --> 06:44:08,240
Bonafortuna take the money your meager salary you will need it my patron has been arrested after all

6254
06:44:09,600 --> 06:44:11,600
true

6255
06:44:14,080 --> 06:44:16,080
Mm-hmm

6256
06:44:16,400 --> 06:44:18,960
You've got a lot for China. Oops

6257
06:44:20,240 --> 06:44:22,440
V sucky manager game of thrones

6258
06:44:23,880 --> 06:44:29,120
There is a limit cousins and relatives seemed okay direct bloodline off

6259
06:44:30,760 --> 06:44:32,760

06:44:33,720 --> 06:44:38,320
Why is my tracking is my why is my tracking stopped hello?

6261
06:44:39,000 --> 06:44:41,000
Ah

6262
06:44:45,200 --> 06:44:51,120
Is my PC dead or is it just my tracking has gave up hey, you want to recalibrate real quick

6263
06:44:59,840 --> 06:45:02,680
I need to play but my thing is not working

6264
06:45:03,000 --> 06:45:10,400
Whoo, hello. No, it's not. I have my iPhone on fuck. Oh my iPhone is burning

6265
06:45:11,920 --> 06:45:16,040
Let me just pause that real quick. Oh, did you see all of them?

6266
06:45:19,720 --> 06:45:25,720
Okay, hold on that am I back up to sink, okay? Oh

6267
06:45:26,520 --> 06:45:30,060
Just yeah, it's like in so fast there

6268
06:45:30,660 --> 06:45:32,660
Oh

6269
06:45:35,660 --> 06:45:39,460
Then a cannonball should appear. Yeah, there you go cannonball

6270
06:45:40,620 --> 06:45:42,620
And it got me as well. I

6271
06:45:43,740 --> 06:45:45,740
My iPhone's on fire

6272
06:45:50,100 --> 06:45:56,100
Hidden blade only let's go. I'm a hidden blade some people enjoy the source some people enjoy the heavy weaponry

6273
06:45:56,900 --> 06:45:58,100
I

6274
06:45:58,100 --> 06:46:02,620
Double assassin blade for me. I died through I better know I'm died

6275
06:46:04,620 --> 06:46:11,860
For the phones about to explode honestly, I hope not, but it's very hot. I think because it's charged like I've charged it

6276
06:46:13,780 --> 06:46:15,780
This entire time

6277
06:46:16,540 --> 06:46:18,540
Like it's got charger

6278
06:46:19,540 --> 06:46:21,540
Oh

6279
06:46:22,260 --> 06:46:29,700
The iPhone better get used to it you better not be there raises stamina levels for me

6280
06:46:32,700 --> 06:46:35,100
Mmm the cinematic

6281
06:46:36,420 --> 06:46:42,340
Like when it does like the cinematic kill it looks so nice and like all the different weaponry

6282
06:46:42,340 --> 06:46:46,860
I have to admit so like obviously not matter someone prepare something else

6283
06:46:47,860 --> 06:46:50,060
Not the whole oh, wait, no, I lied

6284
06:46:52,820 --> 06:46:55,820
I lied I thought all the horsey's got no

6285
06:46:57,980 --> 06:46:59,980
I

6286
06:47:00,020 --> 06:47:05,220
Completely forgot I thought all the horses go back up. Why would they do that at the end of the game?

6287
06:47:05,220 --> 06:47:07,220
I assume I'm allowed to be spotted

6288
06:47:08,780 --> 06:47:13,580
Doesn't matter if I get spotted or is this one of them ones where I shouldn't be spotted

6289
06:47:17,180 --> 06:47:22,100
No, I can be spot, that's absolutely fine with me

6290
06:47:23,420 --> 06:47:27,140
But they're heavy mason heavy infantry

6291
06:47:29,300 --> 06:47:31,820
Doesn't matter if I get spot, so I'm just gonna send it I

6292
06:47:32,900 --> 06:47:38,620
Can't believe I forgot about that horsey war see I do apologize. I don't like when they do that

6293
06:47:39,420 --> 06:47:45,380
He's just taking a nap. He's just taking a nap. I mean I take one too, you know, he needs to sleep off

6294
06:47:45,380 --> 06:47:47,380
He needs to sleep off what happened

6295
06:47:48,460 --> 06:47:51,660
No, you've not seen me before unless you know

6296
06:48:02,980 --> 06:48:04,980
The batteries swelled up

6297
06:48:05,940 --> 06:48:10,140
We did I left my Android phone on charge for you and the battery so like

6298
06:48:10,860 --> 06:48:12,900
Like pop like a balloon type swell

6299
06:48:15,380 --> 06:48:17,380
It's his dangerous

6300
06:48:27,500 --> 06:48:29,500
Honestly, pray bruising

6301
06:48:29,620 --> 06:48:31,620
Ah

6302
06:48:35,500 --> 06:48:37,500
Leave me alone

6303
06:48:43,780 --> 06:48:47,780
Unfortunately for this section both factions will target you

6304
06:48:51,460 --> 06:48:57,820
So the best advice really is to go at the checkpoint and destroy whoever goes for you

6305
06:48:59,500 --> 06:49:04,580
And they will always sign but you can't progress until they leave you alone

6306
06:49:04,580 --> 06:49:07,620
So just I can't actually see what's going on, but thank you

6307
06:49:09,340 --> 06:49:13,140
Okay, there you go. You just need to wait for them to leave you alone

6308
06:49:14,780 --> 06:49:18,500
Any water my battery make sure it's not too cool and it too hot

6309
06:49:21,580 --> 06:49:25,560
Yes, it's so the smartest thing to do is to claim the burning

6310
06:49:26,020 --> 06:49:30,200
Siege tower you're you're so smart the wooden flammable siege tower

6311
06:49:31,320 --> 06:49:33,320
Not sure about that one it's

6312
06:49:34,280 --> 06:49:36,560
Like your accent. Thanks spawned in with it

6313
06:49:39,520 --> 06:49:42,560
Spacey phone pillow keeps your pillow nice and warm

6314
06:49:44,360 --> 06:49:46,360
Do we need to take the rooftops I actually

6315
06:49:47,600 --> 06:49:52,520
Well, that was a lot of enemies to appear on the screen

6316
06:49:52,600 --> 06:49:55,720
This section is the same where both factions will target you

6317
06:49:58,680 --> 06:50:02,800
You need to become an anonymous can I hide behind this and

6318
06:50:04,360 --> 06:50:07,900
Be left alone. Oh, is he gonna attack me?

6319
06:50:12,440 --> 06:50:14,440
Okay, okay, I

6320
06:50:14,680 --> 06:50:20,240
Was trying to see if I can get away with it. It's just a bit like why would they both randomly target me?

6321
06:50:20,240 --> 06:50:21,600
I have no

6322
06:50:21,600 --> 06:50:27,040
Like fight with them, but I don't even know who they're they're fighting each other and they're the same

6323
06:50:28,240 --> 06:50:31,760
They have the same uniform on they found the traitor

6324
06:50:35,160 --> 06:50:37,160
I know what wrong when I'm gonna guess

6325
06:50:39,160 --> 06:50:41,160
Leave me alone

6326
06:50:44,720 --> 06:50:47,320
Right, let's try again this time it's not on fire

6327
06:50:47,320 --> 06:50:52,000
My world's on fire, how about yours?

6328
06:50:53,560 --> 06:50:55,560
No, I

6329
06:50:55,800 --> 06:51:01,920
The water's getting thin the water's getting warm so you might as well swim. Mm-hmm. I don't know the words

6330
06:51:01,920 --> 06:51:03,920
I can never remember what I

6331
06:51:04,720 --> 06:51:12,080
Can never remember words in order of like actual songs and then the best I can do is go

6332
06:51:12,360 --> 06:51:14,360
Ah

6333
06:51:14,680 --> 06:51:19,760
The back streets a never gone what you wanna say banana banana, what you gonna do?

6334
06:51:20,400 --> 06:51:22,000
That's not a word

6335
06:51:22,000 --> 06:51:26,560
Hey, now you're an assassin get your game on cool play

6336
06:51:28,680 --> 06:51:34,960
His name's not Caesar Chasry's gonna die kicking in my balls

6337
06:51:37,520 --> 06:51:39,520
Hey

6338
06:51:42,080 --> 06:51:44,080
That's right, baby

6339
06:51:47,640 --> 06:51:52,900
So much to kill so much to do so much assassinate and on the spreadsheets a

6340
06:51:53,640 --> 06:52:02,200
Never know when I'm gonna strike a don't know if it's good advice a so much to pee so much to do

6341
06:52:03,640 --> 06:52:08,640
Gotta disarm the guard I can't do that so that's fine. I'm taking out the double knife

6342
06:52:13,000 --> 06:52:16,240
Trying to pistol whip try again with the tip. Oh

6343
06:52:18,440 --> 06:52:24,280
It's actually much easier just to shoot Chasry there if you should have you take a health bar

6344
06:52:26,360 --> 06:52:28,360
And removing his armor

6345
06:52:30,360 --> 06:52:34,060
He wishes he was a farmer. Oh, he got me first

6346
06:52:34,300 --> 06:52:36,300
Oh

6347
06:52:36,620 --> 06:52:38,540
You can't

6348
06:52:38,540 --> 06:52:45,620
No, run at a time. Oh, he broke my armor. Oh, that's not good. Oh, that's not good. Okay. I actually don't want that

6349
06:52:45,620 --> 06:52:47,620
I'm taking it my double bleeds

6350
06:52:51,060 --> 06:52:52,740
Take this

6351
06:52:52,740 --> 06:53:00,300
Take that in this and take my knee to your boss my knee to your boss

6352
06:53:01,300 --> 06:53:04,780
Didn't want to put my balls on your jaws

6353
06:53:05,740 --> 06:53:10,100
It's my knee. Oh shit. I'm actually kind of messing this up. I might need to try hard

6354
06:53:10,940 --> 06:53:14,700
Hold on. Hold on. Let me get rid of these guards first and then go for Chasry

6355
06:53:14,700 --> 06:53:18,740
But then whoa, wait, wait, wait, wait, you can't keep spawning new guards. I

6356
06:53:20,140 --> 06:53:22,780
Mean, maybe you can but like

6357
06:53:23,540 --> 06:53:29,060
You shouldn't you should give me a chance to kill. Oh, we're getting a bit crowded

6358
06:53:29,060 --> 06:53:35,700
We're getting a bit crowded in here. I did it too many of you. This is starting to get a bit here. He's gonna

6359
06:53:37,700 --> 06:53:39,700
Can I do this?

6360
06:53:40,020 --> 06:53:43,580
Okay, Chasry is that's fine. I expected that

6361
06:53:44,780 --> 06:53:48,300
Okay, Chasry's like one seriously. He's like one

6362
06:53:49,420 --> 06:53:51,260
Okay

6363
06:53:51,260 --> 06:53:54,420
One more reload faster. Okay. There we go

6364
06:53:54,940 --> 06:53:56,940
He

6365
06:53:58,580 --> 06:54:00,580
That's really how much Nick armor do you have?

6366
06:54:02,540 --> 06:54:04,860
Wanting something does not make it your right

6367
06:54:06,860 --> 06:54:12,740
That the true leader empowers the people he rules I will lead mankind into a new world

6368
06:54:13,740 --> 06:54:15,740
Can this sooner record you do

6369
06:54:20,860 --> 06:54:23,460
No man can murder me

6370
06:54:24,420 --> 06:54:26,420
Then I leave you in the hands of fate

6371
06:54:43,500 --> 06:54:45,500
The throne was mine

6372
06:54:47,340 --> 06:54:49,540
What do you know what do you know?

6373
06:54:50,420 --> 06:54:52,420
I

6374
06:54:53,740 --> 06:54:58,860
Lead mankind into a new world we take illiterally in these parts

6375
06:55:02,340 --> 06:55:06,820
You cannot kill me no man can murder me

6376
06:55:14,820 --> 06:55:16,820
The apple

6377
06:55:20,540 --> 06:55:27,300
The vault oh my god, we're playing borderlands too. It's the ball

6378
06:55:34,900 --> 06:55:42,180
So it's he was put the apple of Eden away and the vault left behind by the gods, so it's not in the hands of man

6379
06:55:44,260 --> 06:55:46,260
You'll call a sale

6380
06:55:49,540 --> 06:55:52,220
We've got it Colosseum we're about to go to present day

6381
06:55:53,380 --> 06:55:55,380
gravity claims another victim

6382
06:55:56,140 --> 06:55:58,140
fall damage buff

6383
06:55:58,580 --> 06:56:00,580
request

6384
06:56:11,140 --> 06:56:17,940
Perfect recall so we need some kind of futuristic key it seems to open with a verbally triggered mechanism

6385
06:56:18,940 --> 06:56:22,940
It's God kind of why I'm saying it out for back

6386
06:56:24,380 --> 06:56:26,380
That'll be quiet. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm getting too excited

6387
06:56:31,980 --> 06:56:39,500
Like that European power grid is Italy the only country in your you've got

6388
06:56:40,820 --> 06:56:42,820
Problem is he's dead

6389
06:56:47,940 --> 06:56:54,780
Okay, if you cut scenes up, it's all trying to be quiet. I'm just so excited. So I do apologize for talking over like

6390
06:56:56,340 --> 06:56:58,340
Just a bit of I said we belly

6391
06:56:59,100 --> 06:57:01,100
Hey, maybe it has something to do with this

6392
06:57:10,780 --> 06:57:12,700
Symbol matches the one on the door to the vault

6393
06:57:14,700 --> 06:57:17,260
1419 1420 1421

6394
06:57:17,940 --> 06:57:22,580
What if they aren't dates 1419 1420? Oh

6395
06:57:24,140 --> 06:57:26,220
My god, what?

6396
06:57:27,700 --> 06:57:29,060
God

6397
06:57:29,060 --> 06:57:35,140
Tell us already. I am I am that I am the tetragrammaton the 72 names of God

6398
06:57:35,140 --> 06:57:38,300
You see they're all contained within three verses

6399
06:57:38,500 --> 06:57:45,220
Exodus 19 through 21 and to get this your likeness if you arrange the four Hebrew letters in God's name within an equilateral

6400
06:57:45,940 --> 06:57:49,940
Triangle, then you miracle values add up to the same number

6401
06:57:50,700 --> 06:57:53,200
72 are you absolutely sure about this?

6402
06:57:53,660 --> 06:57:56,540
That's kind of why I'm saying it out loud Rebecca. Yeah, but

6403
06:57:59,060 --> 06:58:05,780
Construction on the Colosseum began in the year 72. I think we have our password

6404
06:58:06,540 --> 06:58:08,540
Sean go get the van

6405
06:58:08,860 --> 06:58:10,860
We

6406
06:58:13,980 --> 06:58:20,420
Now know the password to the vault in order to get the apple of Eden

6407
06:58:22,180 --> 06:58:24,780
I'm a calibrate again. Hold on. I

6408
06:58:29,620 --> 06:58:31,620
Calibrated now my mouth

6409
06:58:33,380 --> 06:58:35,380
You know everything

6410
06:58:36,060 --> 06:58:38,060
Really?

6411
06:58:39,500 --> 06:58:44,980
That's right, I've seen your car that tunnel should lead under capital line hill. I'll help them find another entrance

6412
06:58:45,660 --> 06:58:51,020
Be careful Desmond. I'll drive. Ah, yeah, nice try. I've seen your car. Oh

6413
06:58:53,300 --> 06:58:56,140
Base the sassans creed said women bad driver

6414
06:59:02,140 --> 06:59:07,460
That's terrible dev team you knew exactly what you're doing putting that in

6415
06:59:09,140 --> 06:59:13,820
There's a lot of dialogue up heads. I'll try and be quiet

6416
06:59:15,860 --> 06:59:17,860
Lucy I'm making my way toward the entrance

6417
06:59:24,860 --> 06:59:26,860
I'll keep that in mind

6418
06:59:38,540 --> 06:59:40,900
I can't believe I'm actually gonna hold the apple

6419
06:59:45,340 --> 06:59:49,100
Wonder if it'll change this whether it can tip the scales in our favor

6420
06:59:49,780 --> 06:59:53,740
Me trying not to read it like say every quote that I remember I

6421
06:59:54,940 --> 06:59:58,220
Was gonna say tip the scales. I don't know if the make pick that up by literally

6422
07:00:01,900 --> 07:00:04,940
What do you think we'll find hopefully a map

6423
07:00:08,700 --> 07:00:10,700
Yeah

6424
07:00:11,700 --> 07:00:13,700
Hey, maybe this time we'll be lucky

6425
07:00:18,700 --> 07:00:24,820
On my first playthrough I never found this for like ages it's so slight and cheeky

6426
07:00:27,260 --> 07:00:31,420
Cheeky like my little rhythm so much construction this place is like a maze

6427
07:00:39,380 --> 07:00:41,380
I

6428
07:00:42,860 --> 07:00:44,860
Know

6429
07:00:45,660 --> 07:00:51,220
So at the end of this there's a quote from the gods

6430
07:00:53,380 --> 07:00:56,220
And I said a message

6431
07:00:57,780 --> 07:00:59,780
No, we hold on

6432
07:01:00,740 --> 07:01:03,060
So that's why we're playing this game on my birthday

6433
07:01:05,020 --> 07:01:07,580
Because it's October 10th in the present day

6434
07:01:08,700 --> 07:01:10,700
72

6435
07:01:15,140 --> 07:01:18,460
It's the door code someone wants to make sure we get it right

6436
07:01:25,900 --> 07:01:27,060
Okay

6437
07:01:27,060 --> 07:01:29,940
If I don't move the cutscenes not gonna begin

6438
07:01:30,380 --> 07:01:36,100
But I just want to say there's a quote from the God at the end of this and she says go forth and

6439
07:01:36,620 --> 07:01:40,860
And and I may or may not have said be embraced by the six

6440
07:01:41,620 --> 07:01:45,300
Because of that quote and I hope you understand it when you hear it

6441
07:01:47,060 --> 07:01:51,580
So be embraced by the six it's cuz it's all in my love

6442
07:01:53,900 --> 07:01:55,900
And the other is the six

6443
07:01:57,380 --> 07:02:01,140
Just wait for okay, just wait for it. I tell you I tell you I show you I show you

6444
07:02:02,220 --> 07:02:05,100
But I hope the six have embraced you dearly

6445
07:02:07,020 --> 07:02:13,100
I'm braced us by the no set six number six numeral in those today's quadros

6446
07:02:13,620 --> 07:02:16,260
Cincuses, I know it's kind of hard just

6447
07:02:19,660 --> 07:02:21,900
We commit to this space the epilogue

6448
07:02:23,260 --> 07:02:27,660
Let it be found by he who is deemed worthy let it guide him

6449
07:02:28,140 --> 07:02:30,140
Let it shape his path forward

6450
07:02:30,660 --> 07:02:33,180
Let it save the world we leave behind

6451
07:02:34,020 --> 07:02:36,020
Who are you?

6452
07:02:39,300 --> 07:02:41,300
Jino

6453
07:02:47,540 --> 07:02:51,460
We're getting close boys to the end. I don't want it to end but

6454
07:02:54,500 --> 07:03:00,020
That's been fan half the cleanest campaign sorry went the wrong way dafty and I don't want me to go

6455
07:03:04,180 --> 07:03:08,580
I'm getting like really close to getting chills cuz like I know what's up ahead

6456
07:03:18,380 --> 07:03:23,180
In the beginning we set our truth to parchment to stone

6457
07:03:23,740 --> 07:03:25,740
to the memory of men

6458
07:03:26,140 --> 07:03:29,180
These proved impermanent thing. I'm sorry my mouth's open

6459
07:03:34,020 --> 07:03:37,700
Blood literally like a child like

6460
07:03:43,860 --> 07:03:51,180
Oh clings by fire clings by famine such such like huge dialogue

6461
07:03:52,020 --> 07:03:55,780
Just to show that history cannot last on parchment like it's just such

6462
07:03:56,580 --> 07:03:58,580
genius

6463
07:04:03,580 --> 07:04:05,580
I

6464
07:04:10,580 --> 07:04:12,580
Think I found an entrance

6465
07:04:12,580 --> 07:04:18,740
You think you found an entrance after the like the freaking floor the pavilion opens up. Okay. Yeah entrance, okay?

6466
07:04:22,180 --> 07:04:24,180
Wow

6467
07:04:25,860 --> 07:04:29,340
Hmm oh I'm getting chills

6468
07:04:33,180 --> 07:04:35,180
I

6469
07:04:41,820 --> 07:04:44,860
Let me in I'm coming

6470
07:04:50,220 --> 07:04:52,140
But on what can it last took you long enough

6471
07:04:53,340 --> 07:04:55,900
What is this? What happens if it didn't have to last?

6472
07:04:56,940 --> 07:04:59,820
See those columns. What if we just enjoyed every moment?

6473
07:05:03,180 --> 07:05:05,180
On top of the ancient Temple of Juno

6474
07:05:07,580 --> 07:05:13,540
I like the ceiling do you like the ceiling you are a fascinating traveling companion

6475
07:05:23,780 --> 07:05:29,580
Look how detailed this is there's something up there like

6476
07:05:30,580 --> 07:05:32,580
2010

6477
07:05:34,860 --> 07:05:39,340
Like look how accurate it is please can we do history games?

6478
07:05:39,900 --> 07:05:46,740
Where we can all just nerd about history and like the things like they even bother to do the text and stuff like under the

6479
07:05:46,740 --> 07:05:48,740
Paintings to be like this is from

6480
07:05:49,580 --> 07:05:51,580
like

6481
07:05:53,260 --> 07:05:55,260
Such a good game

6482
07:05:55,260 --> 07:05:57,260
Just stay down here then shall we oh

6483
07:05:57,460 --> 07:06:02,180
Pray or something. It's appreciate everything. It's so good. It's so good

6484
07:06:02,180 --> 07:06:06,660
I'm so glad I get to share the game with you and hopefully you maybe play on your own sometime

6485
07:06:08,100 --> 07:06:10,100
You've experienced

6486
07:06:18,140 --> 07:06:21,660
That guy is sassy Sean is a very sassy character a

6487
07:06:22,660 --> 07:06:25,140
Very British deadpan

6488
07:06:28,020 --> 07:06:31,940
Wow ready to speak to the gods

6489
07:06:51,980 --> 07:06:54,780
Hey, actually, I'm a he him. Sorry

6490
07:07:11,700 --> 07:07:13,700
Destroyed what we could feel the way of

6491
07:07:16,300 --> 07:07:18,300
Something's open

6492
07:07:21,660 --> 07:07:23,900
Does not take many to unwind the world

6493
07:07:26,540 --> 07:07:28,540
Here is a safe place

6494
07:07:29,180 --> 07:07:32,500
eternal to store objects words

6495
07:07:33,580 --> 07:07:34,860
wisdom

6496
07:07:34,860 --> 07:07:36,860
But not life

6497
07:07:36,860 --> 07:07:38,860
Almost did we have the means?

6498
07:07:39,460 --> 07:07:42,620
But time erodes time. He wrote us

6499
07:07:45,820 --> 07:07:48,940
We distract him we can see past him

6500
07:07:48,940 --> 07:07:50,940
We left when he strikes right

6501
07:07:51,620 --> 07:07:53,620
But his reach is so very long

6502
07:07:54,220 --> 07:07:56,220
It's stamina unending

6503
07:07:57,140 --> 07:07:59,140
We cannot evade his grasp

6504
07:07:59,140 --> 07:08:01,140
not forever

6505
07:08:03,580 --> 07:08:07,260
Here goes so she's telling us why the gods perished

6506
07:08:08,620 --> 07:08:11,900
Because something constantly is getting them

6507
07:08:12,980 --> 07:08:14,980
Just like strutting stamina

6508
07:08:15,780 --> 07:08:18,980
Yeah, I reclaimed you like that my stamina's unending

6509
07:08:20,460 --> 07:08:22,460
It's a shame you have a refractory period

6510
07:08:28,380 --> 07:08:31,660
It must come in with the blood

6511
07:08:45,740 --> 07:08:50,220
I'm I'm Sean in this one

6512
07:08:53,380 --> 07:08:55,580
I'm holding on to the little knob in the middle

6513
07:09:00,980 --> 07:09:02,980
Well, we're doing it

6514
07:09:03,500 --> 07:09:07,260
If you want to kill us mate, you're gonna have to try a little harder than that

6515
07:09:10,660 --> 07:09:12,660
We're here

6516
07:09:13,500 --> 07:09:15,500
Music

6517
07:09:16,860 --> 07:09:18,860
Beautiful scenery the details

6518
07:09:25,100 --> 07:09:28,580
That is Sean's right that is I'm always right

6519
07:09:29,380 --> 07:09:35,780
About that dead end that never happened. I was misquoted music picks up and you can hear the voices

6520
07:09:37,620 --> 07:09:40,940
Just a theory all sounding voices

6521
07:09:43,460 --> 07:09:45,460
And all

6522
07:09:47,060 --> 07:09:50,580
This milk the door is it I'm not being pranked why this is a little in the door

6523
07:09:51,820 --> 07:09:53,700
I'm being pranked

6524
07:09:53,700 --> 07:09:58,220
It's really a secret behind that the kind of lucid there may be a secret, but maybe it's just a reuse that's it

6525
07:10:03,020 --> 07:10:09,300
Think it speaks English just say it okay 72

6526
07:10:12,660 --> 07:10:14,660
Oh

6527
07:10:39,140 --> 07:10:41,140
There's a field

6528
07:10:42,660 --> 07:10:44,660
I

6529
07:10:48,100 --> 07:10:50,100
The apple seems to be in the center

6530
07:10:53,460 --> 07:10:55,460
I'm to find out where those temples are

6531
07:10:57,780 --> 07:11:04,700
Okay, no, this is where the sad part comes in because I always mess up the sequence. I'm really

6532
07:11:04,700 --> 07:11:06,700
I

6533
07:11:12,220 --> 07:11:16,100
Always mess up the sequence the orb

6534
07:11:27,780 --> 07:11:29,780
Big lady

6535
07:11:30,780 --> 07:11:32,780
Knowledge

6536
07:11:34,700 --> 07:11:36,700
Only try

6537
07:11:38,260 --> 07:11:41,140
On a wisdom no knowledge story wisdom wisdom

6538
07:11:43,180 --> 07:11:45,180
Knowledge

6539
07:11:46,900 --> 07:11:48,900
Of course not fake gamer

6540
07:11:52,580 --> 07:11:54,580
Try to join you

6541
07:11:56,540 --> 07:11:58,540
Hear the words

6542
07:11:59,540 --> 07:12:00,540
I

6543
07:12:00,540 --> 07:12:08,260
Have played this game so many times. I always end up failing the levers. I didn't know you could eagle sense the lever. I

6544
07:12:09,580 --> 07:12:14,100
Have just literally my brain said maybe one's highlighted and the other isn't

6545
07:12:14,900 --> 07:12:17,740
How many times have I played this game and never done that before I?

6546
07:12:18,460 --> 07:12:20,460
Always mess up on the lever

6547
07:12:21,700 --> 07:12:23,700
I'll be quite

6548
07:12:28,540 --> 07:12:30,540
Activated

6549
07:12:33,860 --> 07:12:35,860
Did you hear any of that I

6550
07:12:41,020 --> 07:12:46,020
Sure do love all my friends equally. I love Rebecca

6551
07:12:46,020 --> 07:12:52,700
I love Sean and I love Lucy and I'm sure all will be fine

6552
07:12:53,340 --> 07:12:55,340
Wait, where'd I go? Oh

6553
07:12:58,540 --> 07:13:00,540
Oh

6554
07:13:19,420 --> 07:13:24,540
So where are the temples you want me to ask it or think it

6555
07:13:29,140 --> 07:13:31,140
I

6556
07:13:32,740 --> 07:13:34,740
Sure, you asked it the right thing I

6557
07:13:35,420 --> 07:13:37,540
Know this

6558
07:13:37,540 --> 07:13:39,040
That's a frigid cat

6559
07:13:39,040 --> 07:13:42,660
It stands for freedom and that that's a Masonic eye

6560
07:13:43,260 --> 07:13:45,660
Now those two come together in only one place

6561
07:13:47,660 --> 07:13:53,260
I can't move your DNA communes with the apple you have activated it

6562
07:13:54,220 --> 07:13:58,980
Let me go on the 72nd day before the moment of awakening

6563
07:13:59,460 --> 07:14:01,220
You

6564
07:14:01,220 --> 07:14:05,460
Loins and the loins of our enemies the end and the beginning

6565
07:14:06,100 --> 07:14:08,100
Abhor and honor

6566
07:14:08,220 --> 07:14:10,220
The final journey commences

6567
07:14:11,100 --> 07:14:15,820
There is one who would accompany you through the gate. She lies not with our sight

6568
07:14:16,540 --> 07:14:19,140
The cross darkens the horizon

6569
07:14:23,900 --> 07:14:27,220
Doing the path must be opened

6570
07:14:28,740 --> 07:14:32,980
You cannot escape your partners the sales shall be balanced

6571
07:14:36,860 --> 07:14:38,860
Stop please

6572
07:14:38,980 --> 07:14:42,380
You know very little we must guide you

6573
07:14:47,660 --> 07:14:49,660
Please

6574
07:14:54,260 --> 07:14:56,260
No

6575
07:15:08,420 --> 07:15:15,460
It is done the way lies all before you only she remains to be found

6576
07:15:16,620 --> 07:15:18,620
Awaken the six

6577
07:15:23,260 --> 07:15:25,260
You

6578
07:15:40,140 --> 07:15:42,140
Really don't like that

6579
07:15:43,900 --> 07:15:45,900
Really don't like that

6580
07:15:46,020 --> 07:15:50,060
For those of you who haven't played Assassin's Creed 2 and don't mind spoilers

6581
07:15:51,060 --> 07:15:56,380
We were in upstairs goes headquarters and she broke us out

6582
07:15:56,820 --> 07:16:00,980
Because she was pretending to be a Templar. She's actually an assassin

6583
07:16:01,780 --> 07:16:05,940
and then we have just played Assassin's Creed Brotherhood, which is

6584
07:16:07,260 --> 07:16:09,260
sequel and

6585
07:16:10,300 --> 07:16:14,820
She got identified as a double crossing agent twice over

6586
07:16:15,580 --> 07:16:17,580
Which made no sense

6587
07:16:17,660 --> 07:16:19,660
Because why would she break us up and

6588
07:16:20,940 --> 07:16:26,740
If you want to know the real reason why Lucy is killed off in it's your story

6589
07:16:26,740 --> 07:16:28,740
Oh, yeah, sorry in Desmond storyline

6590
07:16:40,460 --> 07:16:46,780
The reason why Lucy's character was killed off is because she asked for

6591
07:16:48,580 --> 07:16:50,580
Like the revenue

6592
07:16:51,940 --> 07:16:56,700
Not for like a payout for her voice, but for the revenue split thing that they do

6593
07:16:57,740 --> 07:16:59,740
No, I can never remember the word

6594
07:17:00,780 --> 07:17:05,860
like where you get like payouts constantly like for your voice and

6595
07:17:07,780 --> 07:17:13,140
Royalties yes royalties. She she knew she was onto something

6596
07:17:13,140 --> 07:17:20,020
She was an Assassin's Creed 2 then she's in a second game Assassin's Creed Brotherhood and she said royalties and

6597
07:17:20,340 --> 07:17:23,020
That end sequence was then created

6598
07:17:23,500 --> 07:17:29,900
Because at no point do the gods speak of present-day issues and if you listen to the gods words

6599
07:17:30,420 --> 07:17:37,300
It was like you don't understand. We need to teach you the gods should not interact with Desmond on that level

6600
07:17:37,660 --> 07:17:39,500
lower-wise and

6601
07:17:39,540 --> 07:17:45,100
Because she wanted royalties killed her and plot and they said yeah, well, we don't need you anymore

6602
07:17:46,100 --> 07:17:50,260
So thanks, Ubisoft absolutely destroyed Lucy's storyline

6603
07:17:51,940 --> 07:17:53,940
And

6604
07:17:53,980 --> 07:17:57,380
Yeah, I hope your shareholders are happy because you ruin it for the people

6605
07:17:58,940 --> 07:18:02,820
But other than that other than that really annoying fact

6606
07:18:05,300 --> 07:18:07,300
Otherwise incredibly good game

6607
07:18:08,300 --> 07:18:10,260
Incredibly good game

6608
07:18:10,260 --> 07:18:17,940
I like to pretend that Lucy is still fully alive and acting as a an assassin and all of that. So yeah

6609
07:18:27,900 --> 07:18:31,500
Oh the VA for Rosa passed away, I didn't know that

6610
07:18:37,620 --> 07:18:39,620
Oh

6611
07:18:42,460 --> 07:18:46,620
But yes, that is the story of Assassin's Creed Brotherhood as

6612
07:18:47,620 --> 07:18:52,460
absolutely 10 out of 10 game experience if you ignore

6613
07:18:53,220 --> 07:18:55,220
the very

6614
07:18:55,420 --> 07:18:58,220
ending dialogue and occurrences

6615
07:18:59,220 --> 07:19:05,940
But that was amazing game and I absolutely loved nerdin about it. I'm probably gonna do the board to tell us

6616
07:19:05,940 --> 07:19:07,940
I don't think I'm ready to go off stream just yet

6617
07:19:08,780 --> 07:19:14,820
So sorry for anyone who's perishing right now and their eyes are bulging out of their skull because of how much they need to

6618
07:19:14,820 --> 07:19:19,820
Sleep right now. I'm very sorry. I'm really enjoying this game and

6619
07:19:20,700 --> 07:19:21,780
Yeah

6620
07:19:21,780 --> 07:19:27,740
Are you still doing the second stream? Yes. So today I was to finish the campaign mode and tomorrow

6621
07:19:27,740 --> 07:19:34,980
We're gonna 100% this game because I have never 100% at this game before always wanted to try never did it

6622
07:19:34,980 --> 07:19:39,700
I believe I may have a hundred percent of Assassin's Creed 2 achievement wise

6623
07:19:41,140 --> 07:19:47,820
Which was like a nightmare trying to get all the feathers, but we can talk about that when we play it on

6624
07:19:48,620 --> 07:19:51,720
June June on October 8

6625
07:19:57,660 --> 07:20:01,860
A lot keep going I've got a couple more hours in me. Oh, yeah, damn you got a stamina minute

6626
07:20:04,980 --> 07:20:06,980
Mmm

6627
07:20:07,300 --> 07:20:09,300
Yes, um

6628
07:20:09,940 --> 07:20:12,140
All the feathers took so long

6629
07:20:14,620 --> 07:20:18,860
Schedules set for October so my birthday is October 10th

6630
07:20:19,260 --> 07:20:22,900
Which is when I will do my doughnut on and for my birthday

6631
07:20:22,900 --> 07:20:28,420
I would like to play Assassin's Creed brotherhood all over again, but I'm gonna play it see was lying

6632
07:20:28,420 --> 07:20:32,420
So on the 8th of October Assassin's Creed 2

6633
07:20:33,420 --> 07:20:43,220
a campaign then Assassin's Creed 2 again for 100% and then brotherhood on the 10th and 11th and then on the

6634
07:20:44,060 --> 07:20:48,260
12th and the 6th the 12th and the 13th would be

6635
07:20:48,660 --> 07:20:51,540
Revelations and we will complete its use storyline

6636
07:20:52,420 --> 07:20:54,420
I'm not very well versed in

6637
07:20:54,660 --> 07:20:59,300
Revelations I have played it a couple of times, but I'm not as well there. So I probably can't Japanese

6638
07:21:00,300 --> 07:21:03,700
About the best strategies for the game

6639
07:21:06,020 --> 07:21:09,940
Are you doing the strong you pass out any presented? I don't know like I

6640
07:21:10,580 --> 07:21:15,820
Want I've been looking at some ASMR challenges like the eight hour ASMR stream challenge

6641
07:21:16,140 --> 07:21:18,620
Maybe I might consider that although my voice

6642
07:21:19,100 --> 07:21:24,540
Breaks pretty quickly for ASMR and whispering is the most damaging thing I can do

6643
07:21:24,940 --> 07:21:26,940
Oh

6644
07:21:27,260 --> 07:21:30,460
You should watch embers after revelations

6645
07:21:34,380 --> 07:21:41,100
I would make a reminder for those days I'll be posting my schedule like I've posted my schedule for this week

6646
07:21:43,140 --> 07:21:48,800
After the needy streamer overload, I think it's like a two-hour game question mark

6647
07:21:49,300 --> 07:21:54,140
I actually need to go and buy the American candy

6648
07:21:54,900 --> 07:22:00,620
And those European suits that I don't buy them and then I need to like clean my desk and stuff

6649
07:22:01,780 --> 07:22:03,780
For cuz I'm doing a hand-cam stream

6650
07:22:06,220 --> 07:22:07,740
Hmm

6651
07:22:07,740 --> 07:22:11,540
Stray if mummy go is our mum are you the granny?

6652
07:22:12,980 --> 07:22:16,780
Don't look into the lore too much of a real or came to be

6653
07:22:18,220 --> 07:22:20,700
Technically there are five children birthed from my loins

6654
07:22:21,140 --> 07:22:23,140
I

6655
07:22:23,580 --> 07:22:25,580
Whispering bad for your voice. Yes, I

6656
07:22:25,940 --> 07:22:29,660
May or may not need a really big pee now that I have just been aware of my bladder

6657
07:22:29,660 --> 07:22:31,660
I just sat on my foot

6658
07:22:32,100 --> 07:22:34,420
Like against well, you know

6659
07:22:35,060 --> 07:22:40,940
Against what and then my brain was like oh by the way sensation. I mean, ah, yes. Yes. I believe I need to pee

6660
07:22:41,340 --> 07:22:43,340
Oh

6661
07:22:47,740 --> 07:22:52,380
Mother Mary virgin birth, uh, no, sorry, it was the reeflings doing oopsies

6662
07:22:53,500 --> 07:23:00,060
That is some are both going wild. That's all I'm saying. Hmm. I don't know how we got it. We didn't get kicked out of that convention

6663
07:23:04,700 --> 07:23:08,660
So I am taking jinkies of water which closes tracking and puts my hypnosis on

6664
07:23:09,620 --> 07:23:11,980
But yes, we'll take a very quick pee break

6665
07:23:12,780 --> 07:23:19,740
And I may make a second cup of well be my third cup of tea, but my second that I'll drink on stream with you

6666
07:23:19,740 --> 07:23:25,300
I just need water and drink. I actually don't need any food that those snacks really satiated me

6667
07:23:25,300 --> 07:23:30,300
I have been satiated. I thank you for letting me eat on stream

6668
07:23:30,300 --> 07:23:32,300
No, no, no, no

6669
07:23:33,500 --> 07:23:37,500
Stream elements is how we pay child support. Yeah, I don't know what's going on

6670
07:23:37,500 --> 07:23:42,780
I unironically think you guys were given like so much money collectively to the girls

6671
07:23:43,340 --> 07:23:47,620
Once the tip page was up that you guys broke the PayPal

6672
07:23:49,660 --> 07:23:52,480
Yeah, so thanks for giving us so much money that

6673
07:23:53,780 --> 07:23:56,620
PayPal is now investigating the account or something. I don't know

6674
07:23:56,620 --> 07:24:02,940
Yeah, if you want to support the girls you can always buy the merch they get a hundred percent of the earnings

6675
07:24:03,340 --> 07:24:07,900
None of it goes to the other and all the girls will they say that they own the

6676
07:24:08,420 --> 07:24:09,940
Ubu market

6677
07:24:09,940 --> 07:24:14,380
Accounts and all that they have logins and it's all their stuff. We did not touch it not to do with us

6678
07:24:14,940 --> 07:24:16,940
but yeah

6679
07:24:17,500 --> 07:24:20,280
Hopefully monetization on YouTube stats

6680
07:24:20,840 --> 07:24:28,920
Statistics update because my statistics were like, yeah, you have 80 watch hours and I'm like, are you sure about that?

6681
07:24:28,920 --> 07:24:32,160
Are you sure YouTube? I don't think so

6682
07:24:32,960 --> 07:24:38,880
All the merch is so cute. I'm so excited for the key chains to arrive and I'll do tap-tap-tap-tap

6683
07:24:38,880 --> 07:24:40,880
Paisa

6684
07:24:46,880 --> 07:24:50,840
Dramatic unfortunately the credits go for a bit

6685
07:24:51,960 --> 07:24:57,280
and they're unskippable, but I do want to special shout out to

6686
07:24:59,160 --> 07:25:01,600
Alex Tremblay for the data manager

6687
07:25:02,720 --> 07:25:07,000
Shout out to Robert Mullen the technical writer fantastic job

6688
07:25:07,360 --> 07:25:09,360
Thank you fire team lead

6689
07:25:09,640 --> 07:25:13,800
Jocelyn Vilex Nolan as if I can say these names be real for real

business days to update your stats because I can apply from partnership

Monetization like right now

6702
07:26:03,280 --> 07:26:08,760
Well, I should be able to but the stats don't say I have the watch time, but I do have the watch time

6703
07:26:09,760 --> 07:26:11,240
so

6704
07:26:11,240 --> 07:26:17,720
But hopefully we can get our monetization streams and then you know all that I have no idea how long this PayPal issue is gonna last

6705
07:26:19,520 --> 07:26:23,600
You guys give literally unironically give so much money that they can't burst I

6706
07:26:25,560 --> 07:26:28,380
Have like 10 watch hours alone. I

6707
07:26:30,440 --> 07:26:32,440
Missed it'll be flash player

6708
07:26:32,720 --> 07:26:38,960
Binding of Isaac started on it, but I never actually played it at that stage only played it like a couple months back

6709
07:26:44,240 --> 07:26:46,240
The Baron

6710
07:26:51,160 --> 07:26:57,880
Hey like the enemies in this game as well, have you like made them multiplayer enemies or like

6711
07:27:03,160 --> 07:27:05,160
I like as well

6712
07:27:05,200 --> 07:27:10,880
The plot line that love all pay is so like I know it's you

6713
07:27:11,320 --> 07:27:15,520
Nicolo, I know it's you and like all these things coincidentally happen at the same time

6714
07:27:15,520 --> 07:27:20,280
I like stories like that because it's like no no you're wrong please

6715
07:27:21,560 --> 07:27:26,160
But thank goodness we did the no swim part that was awful grabbed a poor man's horse

6716
07:27:26,640 --> 07:27:33,720
Ran up a side of a building a few times and failed and then like dived across this like beam of rope

6717
07:27:34,880 --> 07:27:41,760
Would you consider playing binding of Isaac on stream? Oh boy? You're in for a treat in November the

6718
07:27:42,960 --> 07:27:48,160
official multiplayer for a binding of Isaac goes live and I would absolutely love to play with you guys

6719
07:27:50,200 --> 07:27:54,640
We will be streaming that game often. I am addicted to it

6720
07:27:55,160 --> 07:28:00,040
I've not before anyone asked have you done dead God? No, I've not done dead God

6721
07:28:00,040 --> 07:28:04,160
Hey, I currently am at like I think it's like

6722
07:28:04,960 --> 07:28:08,600
1001% and it's stop that's where I'm at on one fail

6723
07:28:08,600 --> 07:28:13,560
I have absolutely nothing on the two other save files, but I definitely is gonna be a

6724
07:28:14,240 --> 07:28:20,800
Consistently multiplayer streamed game from bits like I'll do like 12 hour runs for the multiplayer game of that week

6725
07:28:20,800 --> 07:28:23,900
And then like we'll pick up a different multiplayer game type thing and

6726
07:28:25,120 --> 07:28:27,120
Which would be fantastic

6727
07:28:29,240 --> 07:28:36,120
Whoo bending of Isaac is hardly it is a random eyes kind of dungeon

6728
07:28:37,400 --> 07:28:41,700
Crawler, but there's a lot of interesting story in the background of it

6729
07:28:42,200 --> 07:28:43,480
I

6730
07:28:43,480 --> 07:28:50,440
Really enjoy it. I actually want to make a review on this game Assassin's Creed brotherhood and as well as

6731
07:28:50,840 --> 07:28:53,240
Binding of Isaac and call to the lamb

6732
07:28:53,800 --> 07:28:57,040
Basically, I want to make like real game reviews

6733
07:28:57,040 --> 07:29:04,840
But only on games that I think we're 10 out of 10 because I can't stop yapping about them and like bring it up like how flawless the

6734
07:29:05,640 --> 07:29:13,200
In rewarding like the gameplay is and how they've like done the tutorials or what aspects have just really stood out

6735
07:29:13,200 --> 07:29:17,000
Like I just really like it anything would be so nice to try it like

6736
07:29:17,520 --> 07:29:23,240
As much as we all like to dog on like video game journalists and stuff like it is definitely

6737
07:29:26,200 --> 07:29:33,600
Please keep yapping enjoy it if you like the binding of Isaac, I highly recommend no, it's I have never heard of no, it's a

6738
07:29:34,840 --> 07:29:39,040
And is it like pixely like Isaac as well?

6739
07:29:41,040 --> 07:29:45,160
From how you talking here would be awesome at giving some game reviews, uh

6740
07:29:47,000 --> 07:29:49,000
I've got it as a donut on

6741
07:29:49,200 --> 07:29:56,320
Like reward it would take a lot of effort though. Like I definitely think after my donut on is finished

6742
07:29:56,400 --> 07:30:03,000
I'll probably have a few shorter games back-to-back and the reason for that is because I'll be like working on rewards. I

6743
07:30:04,920 --> 07:30:11,680
Literally want to like fire the rewards as soon as possible like once it's done and like all of that

6744
07:30:11,840 --> 07:30:13,840
Um

6745
07:30:14,160 --> 07:30:19,000
Not here runs can go for hours. Oh Isaac runs are like one hour

6746
07:30:19,600 --> 07:30:25,760
Sometimes if you get really good items and stuff you can be wrapped up in 30 minutes with Isaac

6747
07:30:28,360 --> 07:30:30,040
Yeah

6748
07:30:30,040 --> 07:30:35,960
Start each review with a five-minute hypnosis section where you turn your own your hypnosis say you will like this game

6749
07:30:35,960 --> 07:30:38,880
That's so good. You will like this game. You will like this game. You will like this game

6750
07:30:41,680 --> 07:30:44,480
Have you considered collab of girls playing?

6751
07:30:46,000 --> 07:30:48,000
Battleground three

6752
07:30:48,360 --> 07:30:50,360
What's bg? Oh

6753
07:30:50,840 --> 07:30:52,840
No, what's bg?

6754
07:30:53,080 --> 07:30:55,080
Battleground right up in background

6755
07:30:56,880 --> 07:31:00,680
Baldur wait the Baldur's gate is multiplayer. I've never played it

6756
07:31:02,040 --> 07:31:06,160
What did I've never played it and realized it was multiplayer

6757
07:31:07,160 --> 07:31:11,700
Big Baldi's gate right so we have just done it

6758
07:31:12,520 --> 07:31:14,520
We are officially

6759
07:31:15,320 --> 07:31:17,480
Goodness gravy. We have a lot of money on our persons

6760
07:31:17,920 --> 07:31:21,200
This is a bit more money than I think you actually need it. So

6761
07:31:22,200 --> 07:31:25,000
It's given capitalism. It's so it's good capitalism

6762
07:31:25,760 --> 07:31:27,760
Put it back and invest in properties and stuff

6763
07:31:27,760 --> 07:31:33,440
I am going to send the birds away. Yeah, sorry. I'm going to send the recruits away to level up a little bit

6764
07:31:34,200 --> 07:31:38,680
I'm going to do a peep. I'm going to make a cup of tea. So a three-minute break, please

6765
07:31:39,640 --> 07:31:41,640
heavily recommend that you

6766
07:31:42,880 --> 07:31:46,960
You know get up walk around stretch your legs and do a little pee-pee as well

6767
07:31:47,960 --> 07:31:52,000
and we are going to do the Borgia towers next and

6768
07:31:52,800 --> 07:31:54,800
then maybe

6769
07:31:55,560 --> 07:31:57,560
possibly

6770
07:31:58,080 --> 07:32:00,080
and

6771
07:32:00,440 --> 07:32:04,960
Maybe some other miscellaneous stuff. That's just wrong

6772
07:32:06,040 --> 07:32:11,000
I'm trying to find something that both of those last two recruits can go on. I mean, I'm got a

6773
07:32:12,640 --> 07:32:14,040
Oh, you're not strong enough

6774
07:32:14,040 --> 07:32:17,800
So I'll send you on a mission on your own and then for a level two

6775
07:32:17,800 --> 07:32:21,960
I will send you on a level one mission because I really don't want anyone to perish

6776
07:32:22,760 --> 07:32:25,560
He I know you could go up on Baldur's gate. That's so cool

6777
07:32:26,560 --> 07:32:27,960
And

6778
07:32:27,960 --> 07:32:30,320
Yes, I will definitely look into Baldur's gate collab

6779
07:32:30,320 --> 07:32:34,040
I would need to research the game before I play because I really don't know what it's all about

6780
07:32:35,400 --> 07:32:39,960
And okay, I am going to go pee pee because my bladder feels like it's about to burst

6781
07:32:39,960 --> 07:32:44,460
I will tell you if it's neon or not. Don't worry before anyone asks. I can already read your mind

6782
07:32:45,480 --> 07:32:47,480
but I'll do the thing where I

6783
07:32:48,360 --> 07:32:53,920
I'll mute and then put the game back on in the background and no one can see from me up here

6784
07:32:54,160 --> 07:32:59,120
Like that guy that yoinked that thing from me when I was away for like two seconds. It's sort of it

6785
07:32:59,840 --> 07:33:03,120
Okay, please consider getting up and going for a

6786
07:33:04,160 --> 07:33:06,160
pee pee in a lake bridge. I will be back

6787
07:33:07,040 --> 07:33:09,040
Incredibly short like hold on me. Yeah

6788
07:33:23,920 --> 07:33:25,920
So

6789
07:33:53,920 --> 07:33:55,920
So

6790
07:34:23,920 --> 07:34:25,920
So

6791
07:34:53,920 --> 07:34:55,920
So

6792
07:35:23,920 --> 07:35:25,920
So

6793
07:35:53,920 --> 07:35:55,920
So

6794
07:36:23,920 --> 07:36:25,920
So

6795
07:36:53,920 --> 07:36:55,920
So

6796
07:37:23,920 --> 07:37:25,920
So

6797
07:37:53,920 --> 07:37:55,920
So

6798
07:38:23,920 --> 07:38:25,920
So

6799
07:38:53,920 --> 07:38:55,920
So

6800
07:38:55,920 --> 07:38:57,920
So

6801
07:38:57,920 --> 07:38:59,920
So

6802
07:39:28,800 --> 07:39:30,800
Oh

6803
07:39:31,840 --> 07:39:35,520
Gee sure would be a shame if we put some more sass on the screen wouldn't that

6804
07:39:37,040 --> 07:39:42,360
Did you stretch your legs or did you stretch your feet if you're still sitting down?

6805
07:39:46,040 --> 07:39:48,040
Go fish, okay

6806
07:39:48,200 --> 07:39:52,000
Right first things first on the realest. I'm not

6807
07:39:53,080 --> 07:39:57,440
We are going to liberate the Borgia zones as you can see we've done two more

6808
07:39:58,320 --> 07:40:03,120
And now that we have arrow storm we can do these extra super difficult ones

6809
07:40:03,840 --> 07:40:05,360
So there's five more

6810
07:40:05,360 --> 07:40:06,640
Borgia zones

6811
07:40:06,640 --> 07:40:12,400
And what we'll do that and we might do layers of romuli romulus. I keep saying romuli. I don't know why

6812
07:40:13,120 --> 07:40:16,400
Oh, there's a new assassin over here. We should go help them

6813
07:40:17,200 --> 07:40:19,200
Oh, they're across the water

6814
07:40:19,600 --> 07:40:23,360
Are we gonna get something I have a honey tea and a wee water

6815
07:40:24,400 --> 07:40:26,400
with me, um

6816
07:40:26,880 --> 07:40:34,240
I'm not hungry. So I didn't need any snack. There is someone over here that needs our help if I could get there

6817
07:40:37,280 --> 07:40:40,480
Oh, uh, yes, uh, I have terrible news

6818
07:40:40,880 --> 07:40:44,640
It turns out if you adequately hydrate there were stairs right there

6819
07:40:45,040 --> 07:40:46,640
It's you

6820
07:40:46,640 --> 07:40:52,720
Um, if you adequately hydrate, uh turns out your your pee isn't neon

6821
07:40:53,600 --> 07:40:54,640
um

6822
07:40:54,720 --> 07:40:57,520
How what how am I even supposed to get up here? I don't

6823
07:41:00,080 --> 07:41:02,080
Uh, so grass patch

6824
07:41:08,000 --> 07:41:09,520

6826
07:41:12,000 --> 07:41:16,160
No, he's coming back for more. He said nah, I just dropped I want more

6827
07:41:16,640 --> 07:41:19,440
I've had enough of you Borgia scum. Oh my gosh

6829
07:41:22,880 --> 07:41:24,880

Our beloved dark yandere is going live. I believe Azura is still live

6833
07:41:44,400 --> 07:41:51,360
And I believe Emmy has wrapped up for ASMR stream and I assume she'd be his so I actually don't know who's online

6834
07:41:53,200 --> 07:41:55,200
Where am I going? I don't know

6835
07:41:57,120 --> 07:42:02,080
Uh, well, we're way closer to this so we'll go here. Uh, how did I get there?

6836
07:42:04,240 --> 07:42:09,200

07:43:04,560 --> 07:43:08,960
Uh, I understand that uh playing the same game for eight hours may get

6852
07:43:09,520 --> 07:43:16,080
Rather tiresome for some of you. So please do not be afraid to support my gen mates at will

6853
07:43:16,160 --> 07:43:20,400
Oh, this is one of the worst. You need our storm to complete this one as well

6854
07:43:23,120 --> 07:43:25,120
Emmy's ASMR got deleted

6855
07:43:28,160 --> 07:43:30,160
Oh, I guess she's on a warning now

6856
07:43:32,000 --> 07:43:35,120
Emmy what were you doing baby girl?

6857
07:43:36,000 --> 07:43:42,480
Did it actually is it there did she is it like does it say like removed or does it say like

6858
07:43:44,080 --> 07:43:46,080
Uh

6859
07:43:46,240 --> 07:43:48,240
Or does it say she like put it private

6860
07:43:51,040 --> 07:43:53,040
Oh, I said

6861
07:43:53,200 --> 07:43:57,840
Emmy Emmy baby girl we try again monetize come on

6862
07:43:58,880 --> 07:44:02,560
Yeah, I say everyone play video games. We can do ASMR later when you play video games now

6863
07:44:03,440 --> 07:44:06,480
She had a bit too much fun. What the heck did she do in that stream?

6864
07:44:07,200 --> 07:44:11,040
Goddamn we memeing on assassin's screen and she's over there doing

6865
07:44:12,720 --> 07:44:18,400
Uh, right. We need to wait for our assassin signals to be ready for this next session. It's that cushion

6866
07:44:19,440 --> 07:44:21,440
Um, the bed was squeaking

6867
07:44:25,280 --> 07:44:27,280
Mouth sounds

6868
07:44:27,840 --> 07:44:29,280
She got a warning

6869
07:44:29,280 --> 07:44:35,680
Emmy Emmy Emmy do do a stunt. Okay. Go go on your twitter and be like youtube

6870
07:44:35,680 --> 07:44:38,880
This is so unfair. You're targeting me or something like that

6871
07:44:39,280 --> 07:44:46,560
And then I'll get picked up by vtuber news thing and then uh, I don't know question marks and then profit or something

6872
07:44:46,640 --> 07:44:48,640
I don't know

6873
07:44:49,040 --> 07:44:50,800
Hmm

6874
07:44:50,800 --> 07:44:55,520
I definitely think uh youtube is now considering ear licking sounds

6875
07:44:56,480 --> 07:44:58,480
know to be

6876
07:44:59,760 --> 07:45:01,760
Sucking sounds of an alternative

6877
07:45:02,480 --> 07:45:04,240
variation

6878
07:45:04,240 --> 07:45:06,560
And that is why there's this weird crack down

6879
07:45:08,960 --> 07:45:12,080
Um youtube i'm a literally neural day wrote them

6880
07:45:13,840 --> 07:45:19,120
Yeah, newly debuted vtuber banned unfairly. That's right. Get it written in the papers

6881
07:45:19,920 --> 07:45:21,920
teasing i'm teasing

6882
07:45:22,160 --> 07:45:29,680
As long as emmy had a good stream and um her pin pals were enjoying themselves

6883
07:45:30,160 --> 07:45:32,320
Look things happen life ain't that

6884
07:45:33,360 --> 07:45:35,360
Life ain't that serious

6885
07:45:35,600 --> 07:45:40,400
That's uh, uh, we do we do have a uh, hold on. I'm so sorry. I need to

6886
07:45:41,440 --> 07:45:43,440
You okay. Hold on

6887
07:45:45,440 --> 07:45:47,440
Okay, there you go

6888
07:45:48,960 --> 07:45:50,960
Uh, sorry um

6889
07:45:51,200 --> 07:45:56,000
You have to use the sasin signal on him or he runs away and gets away every time

6890
07:45:56,800 --> 07:45:58,800
Um, what was I saying?

6891
07:46:00,080 --> 07:46:03,840
Uh, emmy having fun. Yeah, as long as as long as she had fun as long as the pin pals

6892
07:46:04,720 --> 07:46:06,720
Pen pals had fun

6893
07:46:06,960 --> 07:46:12,640
Then guess what all is good like it's not a big deal or for me. It's not a big deal anyway

6894
07:46:13,200 --> 07:46:18,960
I assume she's fine and everyone's safe and having a good consenting time. It's all that matters at the end of the day

6895
07:46:19,520 --> 07:46:24,320
Uh, she's happy. I'm happy and if she's not happy, I'll try my best to make her a happy beam

6896
07:46:25,600 --> 07:46:27,600
um

6897
07:46:27,680 --> 07:46:29,680
I

6898
07:46:30,080 --> 07:46:35,440
Requesting one of the girls sing a belly idols song white wedding and all the art is about emmy

6899
07:46:36,640 --> 07:46:39,840
I'm gonna be honest. That's going right over my head. If that's something I should know about

6900
07:46:39,920 --> 07:46:44,080
Is that like a reference to I don't know if this can content of the song

6901
07:46:44,800 --> 07:46:46,800
He's gonna be wow wow

6902
07:46:48,000 --> 07:46:51,360
Uh, definitely gonna have to call in my sasin recruits unless

6903
07:46:52,080 --> 07:46:54,480
Vanishing act. Okay. Well try again

6904
07:46:55,680 --> 07:47:01,040
I do actually need to kill quite a few people in the get in the the the smoke

6905
07:47:05,680 --> 07:47:08,320
This is what I think about your long ball

6906
07:47:10,160 --> 07:47:12,320
I'm about to get shafted. Take this

6907
07:47:12,560 --> 07:47:14,560
And this

6908
07:47:15,520 --> 07:47:20,400
No, whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Did my assassin recruits just take all my health there?

6909
07:47:23,360 --> 07:47:25,360
I have potent out please

6910
07:47:25,920 --> 07:47:27,920
All right, you jump boom

6911
07:47:30,640 --> 07:47:32,640
Yeah

6912
07:47:35,200 --> 07:47:37,360
Vanishing act stands completely still

6913
07:47:38,320 --> 07:47:45,360
It turns out it's he was actually one of the worst magicians and he's just gonna stick to his daytime job of assassinating people

6914
07:47:48,160 --> 07:47:51,680
Repfield reference. No, I'm sorry. I don't know

6915
07:47:52,800 --> 07:47:59,680
I don't know what a lot of references are, but thank you for showing patience for me

6916
07:48:01,200 --> 07:48:03,200
For I am strong

6917
07:48:03,520 --> 07:48:08,080
On me and there's a ledge that I can climb on so I have to jump

6918
07:48:09,840 --> 07:48:18,240
And then climb up because I still do not have the climbing glove from the anardo's bench

6919
07:48:19,200 --> 07:48:23,680
But we're getting there in the end and even the whiffing ish campaign mode

6920
07:48:24,320 --> 07:48:26,320
I can't not go any

6921
07:48:26,480 --> 07:48:34,560
Oh, I love how goofy I can be with you guys. You're just like, yeah, I'll just start singing when I'll go for

6922
07:48:41,200 --> 07:48:45,440
If there's nobody left alive to talk about you you were stealthy

6923
07:48:46,640 --> 07:48:48,640
What does that mean?

6924
07:48:49,600 --> 07:48:52,880
Are you meaning? Oh, I forgot to burn the tower

6925
07:48:56,720 --> 07:49:01,920
It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. I love climbing

6926
07:49:02,480 --> 07:49:04,800
I love overexerting my body

6927
07:49:05,440 --> 07:49:06,960
for climbing

6928
07:49:06,960 --> 07:49:11,520
This tower and there were three sides of this tower that are not climbable

6929
07:49:12,160 --> 07:49:15,600
And I climbed over two sides of tower

6930
07:49:16,400 --> 07:49:18,400
of the forge of tower

6931
07:49:18,400 --> 07:49:20,400
Oh

6932
07:49:23,200 --> 07:49:27,520
I think I'm getting a wee bit delirious and won't be honest. I don't like something that I don't know

6933
07:49:29,040 --> 07:49:31,040
and

6934
07:49:31,120 --> 07:49:32,880
Let's see

6935
07:49:32,880 --> 07:49:37,360
Uh, I've made the mistake again. I have to go on the platform

6936
07:49:39,440 --> 07:49:41,440
Delilah

6937
07:49:41,600 --> 07:49:43,600
Where is emi's vod?

6938
07:49:44,160 --> 07:49:49,520
Unfortunately youtube doesn't seem to like earlicking anymore. So it's no longer there

6939
07:49:50,080 --> 07:49:54,160
And sadly no, I will not get anyone to re-upload the vod

6940
07:49:54,880 --> 07:49:57,920
On their channel because it risks their channel

6941
07:49:58,800 --> 07:50:04,080
I want these girls to succeed and have moneys and emi would very much like to move to a place

6942
07:50:04,560 --> 07:50:11,360
That has a freaking washer machine and ac and uh, yeah, I I really don't want emi sweating it up in her

6943
07:50:11,840 --> 07:50:12,960
Uh

6944
07:50:12,960 --> 07:50:18,960
Current situation. So yes, I would like to wait. No, no, don't jump off. I almost did that again

6945
07:50:20,080 --> 07:50:24,640
You're distracting me. You distracted me to the point where I almost jumped off twice

6946
07:50:27,200 --> 07:50:31,920
It's patreon out it is you can find the links in everyone's links

6947
07:50:33,360 --> 07:50:38,480
Um, the website might have got updated to have our links on it now. I'm not sure

6948
07:50:39,200 --> 07:50:41,200
I'm gonna burp

6949
07:50:41,920 --> 07:50:43,600
I'm beautiful

6950
07:50:43,600 --> 07:50:47,120
Can I join velar? I want I want ac too

6951
07:50:48,720 --> 07:50:50,400
I mean

6952
07:50:50,400 --> 07:50:54,800
What you got you got a whole other poll me because if you've got a poll it's no looking good for you

6953
07:50:58,400 --> 07:51:02,240
I'm afraid I have no content creation advice if you've got a poll

6954
07:51:03,120 --> 07:51:05,120
I haven't experienced it. So I ain't got none

6955
07:51:07,360 --> 07:51:09,360
I have no values to you

6956
07:51:11,600 --> 07:51:15,520
The day out here, can you help me? I would gladly fight for you

6957
07:51:16,560 --> 07:51:20,160
Normal household functions. I mean she was like I've no got a washer machine. I'm like

6958
07:51:22,000 --> 07:51:26,000
Uh, I'm starting to think the velar house is looking more and more

6959
07:51:27,440 --> 07:51:32,640
Something I want to invest in because these poor girls are like I want to move out. I want to do this

6960
07:51:32,720 --> 07:51:34,720
I want to do that and I'm like

6961
07:51:34,960 --> 07:51:40,960
Well, I just buy a house and like ship them all out here and then we can just like meme about and stuff

6962
07:51:42,320 --> 07:51:44,640
Because like could you imagine those collabs?

6963
07:51:45,440 --> 07:51:47,360
like just like

6964
07:51:47,360 --> 07:51:54,320
AC bursts into my room and she's like thranny shut up. You're so loud. I'm trying to sleep

6965
07:51:55,280 --> 07:51:57,280
I'm like AC. I'm so sorry

6966
07:51:58,000 --> 07:52:00,000
Like she be comes in the room

6967
07:52:00,480 --> 07:52:03,280
And she's like, throw me. I can't do she be's voice

6968
07:52:05,920 --> 07:52:08,000
But I mean could you imagine

6969
07:52:08,800 --> 07:52:14,400
The noise complaints it would definitely have to be a detached house

6970
07:52:15,360 --> 07:52:16,160
uh

6971
07:52:16,160 --> 07:52:22,560
Cause yeah, that's something crazy. I love the idea of a gen content house, but it's hard to actually oh no you need

6972
07:52:23,760 --> 07:52:25,200
like

6973
07:52:25,200 --> 07:52:30,880
I don't know if you guys like remember in the call of duty days like was it the optic clan

6974

6975
07:52:36,560 --> 07:52:38,240

Right, this is I know

You were supposed to write runny zoom ahead. Um

6979
07:52:48,400 --> 07:52:55,760
But like I remember from eons ago being like that's the coolest thing I've ever seen imagine of all youtubers

6980
07:52:55,760 --> 07:52:57,760
I watch live together

6981
07:52:58,000 --> 07:53:00,480
But I remember I think it was like

6982
07:53:01,120 --> 07:53:05,680
Must have been years ago now. No, not the horse. Okay. Thank god he got off the horse. I got scared there

6983
07:53:06,080 --> 07:53:07,200
and

6984
07:53:07,200 --> 07:53:11,280
Tree you're blocking my view of these enemies. I'm just gonna pretend I'm safe ish

6985
07:53:12,240 --> 07:53:14,560
Uh, can no, no, no, no, don't shoot

6986
07:53:15,840 --> 07:53:17,120
Don't shoot

6987
07:53:17,120 --> 07:53:19,120
Stop the bow

6988
07:53:19,120 --> 07:53:23,520
Oh god, there's horses. I'm scared. Oh, I can hear them

6989
07:53:24,240 --> 07:53:27,920
I feel like I'm playing slender man with these like guards on horses honestly

6990
07:53:29,600 --> 07:53:34,160
Oh, I can't sorry. I'm like trying to finish like one sentence whilst playing this game

6991
07:53:35,120 --> 07:53:36,320
Oh

6992
07:53:36,320 --> 07:53:38,320
Take this. Okay. Ow

6993
07:53:39,360 --> 07:53:40,560

6995
07:53:41,760 --> 07:53:43,520
Man, I fell off

6996
07:53:43,520 --> 07:53:46,720
Oh, I'm just gonna let the recruit steal with him. I guess

6997
07:53:48,560 --> 07:53:50,560
Take that stinky

6998
07:53:51,200 --> 07:53:58,400
Stinky stinky. Why why are you not attacking him? Don't be scared. It's so it's so I know you've been in the game for a long time

6999
07:53:58,560 --> 07:54:00,560
But don't be scared like they're not gonna hurt you

7000
07:54:01,200 --> 07:54:04,880
It's fun as roommates in the beginning it gets really

7001
07:54:06,480 --> 07:54:09,920
No, like that they're um, sorry to get back to what I was saying

7002
07:54:10,000 --> 07:54:14,320
I'm sure I read some sort of review of like what it's like to live with other content creators

7003
07:54:14,720 --> 07:54:18,720
And like I'm pretty sure the default is like it is so loud

7004
07:54:19,200 --> 07:54:25,360
Um, I so things get crazy and out of hand so fast like you have to learn to live as roommates

7005
07:54:26,240 --> 07:54:28,240
unironically because

7006
07:54:28,240 --> 07:54:29,760
um

7007
07:54:29,760 --> 07:54:34,320
Like who's going to do this chore who's going to arrange for the food who's going to arrange to

7008
07:54:35,200 --> 07:54:36,880
um

7009
07:54:36,880 --> 07:54:40,880
Like make sure all is good. Like you don't want to be streaming all the time

7010
07:54:40,880 --> 07:54:44,400
Like so you would have to get like business internet, which means they don't

7011
07:54:45,280 --> 07:54:47,280
like um

7012
07:54:47,600 --> 07:54:52,800
Throttle you if you do too much but business internet is like a thousand dollars per month type thing

7013
07:54:52,960 --> 07:54:58,000
Like it's absolutely wild when you start to get to like that level of content house

7014
07:54:58,400 --> 07:55:00,400
Like the bills are

7015
07:55:00,560 --> 07:55:02,560
astronomical

7016
07:55:04,080 --> 07:55:10,960
You find out that emi believes in not flushing to conserve what are known wants to do the dishes to preserve their nails

7017
07:55:12,320 --> 07:55:15,200
Like I absolutely do love it in theory, but it is

7018
07:55:15,840 --> 07:55:18,000
For me it is not plausible

7019
07:55:19,040 --> 07:55:23,520
And it's just like it's not happening. Oh look at all. Oh, we've got level sevens

7020
07:55:24,000 --> 07:55:31,360
Okay, we're getting stronger. They're there. It's not perfect, but definitely getting stronger

7021
07:55:31,840 --> 07:55:37,200
I am going to send some lower levels away

7022
07:55:39,680 --> 07:55:41,680
Um

7023
07:55:44,720 --> 07:55:46,720
That's not gonna work

7024
07:55:46,960 --> 07:55:50,960
Okay, I'm actually just gonna have to send the lower levels on a level up one

7025
07:55:51,120 --> 07:55:52,240
Um

7026
07:55:52,240 --> 07:55:58,480
Oh, well, it's not really like they're you don't lose an assassin signal if you have six available recruits

7027
07:55:58,560 --> 07:56:04,560
So it's not a problem that I cannot send them on a bigger thing. I am however, we're gonna save this poor guy

7028
07:56:05,680 --> 07:56:07,680
I'll send again this recruits

7029
07:56:08,240 --> 07:56:11,840
It's a cool concept. Honestly, I absolutely adore it. Like especially

7030
07:56:12,640 --> 07:56:13,920
um

7031
07:56:13,920 --> 07:56:15,920
Oh this isn't good

7032
07:56:17,600 --> 07:56:19,600
Oh no

7033
07:56:19,920 --> 07:56:21,920
Oh, no

7034
07:56:25,920 --> 07:56:32,480
Yikes, that was that was not how I imagined we'd save the citizen

7035
07:56:34,720 --> 07:56:38,480
Uh, anyway, let's move on to the next Borgia Tower. Shall we?

7036
07:56:40,720 --> 07:56:43,120
Okay, I think I need to go down

7037
07:56:44,880 --> 07:56:47,600
I'll take you. Hello, Mr. Horsey. You're my problem now

7038
07:56:50,400 --> 07:56:52,400
Oh

7039
07:56:52,720 --> 07:56:56,160
And that might be a good concept that could be for like a smart group club. Yeah

7040
07:56:56,880 --> 07:56:58,240
definitely

7041
07:56:58,240 --> 07:57:02,240
Like I said to the girls like as obviously relationships progress and stuff like

7042
07:57:02,960 --> 07:57:06,880
If you are genuinely serious about like wanting to meet up with each other, um

7043
07:57:07,520 --> 07:57:09,520
Like it's a business expense

7044
07:57:09,520 --> 07:57:12,160
and like we can do it but obviously like

7045
07:57:12,880 --> 07:57:15,360
We've known each other for like two months now, but

7046
07:57:16,320 --> 07:57:20,480
Yeah, I guess a bit early to like start shipping each other to each other's houses and that like

7047
07:57:21,040 --> 07:57:23,040
I definitely think we should let things

7048
07:57:23,440 --> 07:57:27,840
You know some of our relationships form and all that like I I can confidently say like I'm 100%

7049
07:57:28,400 --> 07:57:31,440
Comfortable with the girls, but obviously there was a lot behind it. It's like

7050
07:57:31,920 --> 07:57:37,280
Uh, because I like hired them and scouted for uh, no scout is not the right word

7051
07:57:37,600 --> 07:57:39,600
Oh, I don't want to do a lean or do division

7052
07:57:40,480 --> 07:57:41,680
mission

7053
07:57:41,680 --> 07:57:43,040
um

7054
07:57:43,040 --> 07:57:48,720
I didn't scout for any of them for any of you. So I'm gonna start off now. There was no scouting. Um

7055
07:57:51,280 --> 07:57:52,560
Um

7056
07:57:52,560 --> 07:57:56,240
Like there's a bit of truth and like I see myself

7057
07:57:57,280 --> 07:58:00,720
A little bit in all these girls and like I want them to succeed silly

7058
07:58:01,360 --> 07:58:03,360
and

7059
07:58:03,680 --> 07:58:05,680
Like and

7060
07:58:06,000 --> 07:58:08,000
Where am I going with this?

7061
07:58:08,240 --> 07:58:09,920
Whoa

7062
07:58:09,920 --> 07:58:11,920
I don't think I can keep this guy alive

7063
07:58:12,640 --> 07:58:16,400
He's picking on the guy with the lance first that does the most freaking damage

7064
07:58:17,840 --> 07:58:19,840
Please pick the others

7065
07:58:20,960 --> 07:58:26,960
No, let me go first citizen with no armor or weaponry. Goodness gravy

7066
07:58:28,720 --> 07:58:30,720
Um, you're such a good father

7067
07:58:30,720 --> 07:58:36,960
Yeah, but like unironically I do see like a piece of me in each of them and I just want them nothing to succeed

7068
07:58:37,520 --> 07:58:42,160
But I feel like 100 comfortable and confident around them. Like I don't feel any

7069
07:58:43,680 --> 07:58:45,680
Like any anything, um

7070
07:58:47,600 --> 07:58:49,440
Uh

7071
07:58:49,440 --> 07:58:53,200
Like we had a lot of um side comments that were like

7072
07:58:54,640 --> 07:58:59,680
Sorry, I'm a bit new to the terminology. It was called infighting which is like we're

7073
07:59:00,880 --> 07:59:06,720
The girls like we would compare our viewers and be annoyed at each other or something. I'm so sorry

7074
07:59:06,720 --> 07:59:13,120
I was quite new to the terminology if I'm getting it wrong and it was like, oh how long until they start hating each other and it was like

7075
07:59:14,320 --> 07:59:17,920
Like if you guys could see the behind the scenes of us like memeing about on games

7076
07:59:18,400 --> 07:59:23,280
Or having like a fun little gossip or just like having a good time together and I'm just like

7077
07:59:24,160 --> 07:59:25,200
I

7078
07:59:25,200 --> 07:59:32,000
honestly do not think any of them are capable of that and like you guys already know my stance like if it's

7079
07:59:32,880 --> 07:59:36,480
Um, like I just want them to succeed. I just want them to have an amazing time

7080
07:59:36,480 --> 07:59:40,560
I want them to like achieve their goals. Um home improvement achievement of love

7081
07:59:42,720 --> 07:59:45,040
The fart barrier was broken day one

7082
07:59:46,160 --> 07:59:48,160
Funny you mentioned that um

7083
07:59:49,600 --> 07:59:54,720
When the girls like when we had the first meeting so I had to schedule a meeting

7084
07:59:54,720 --> 07:59:58,960
But I said to them it's not a meeting like I'm forcing you guys to like do

7085
07:59:59,920 --> 08:00:05,200
Like, you know when offices make you play games like oh have played this game with your co-worker

7086
08:00:05,600 --> 08:00:09,280
Uh, I've forgotten what the name is like forced like get together time

7087
08:00:10,160 --> 08:00:11,680
um

7088
08:00:11,680 --> 08:00:17,120
I've completely forgotten the name of it like when offices for icebreakers, I guess like

7089
08:00:17,680 --> 08:00:20,560
There's a bit more of a deeper team building

7090
08:00:21,120 --> 08:00:27,600
Team building exercises. Yes when we had the first meeting I was like, right. What game are we gonna play?

7091
08:00:28,160 --> 08:00:31,920
Um, and we figured out a time and we played video games

7092
08:00:32,400 --> 08:00:37,200
And we played for around two hours and our first thing and we were all just giggling because I was like

7093
08:00:37,440 --> 08:00:43,440
Oh, I'm only going to make it like one hour long because I don't want anyone like overexerting themselves

7094
08:00:43,440 --> 08:00:46,080
like it was the first time we had

7095
08:00:47,120 --> 08:00:53,360
Um interacted and we ended up going over the two hour mark and we were just like laughing our little butts off and then

7096
08:00:53,440 --> 08:00:58,080
Sorry, I'm not paying attention to the game. I'm like literally dying and I'm just like teehee my girl's teehee

7097
08:00:58,640 --> 08:01:00,640
And like none of us wanted to go

7098
08:01:00,960 --> 08:01:06,960
But I I did it at the wrong time. So ac was like up pretty late. Um, so she had to go

7099
08:01:07,600 --> 08:01:12,560
Um, but just like it went fantastic and everyone was so nice to each other and it's just

7100
08:01:14,320 --> 08:01:17,840
Okay, I'm calling in the recruits. Hold on. I need help. I'm calling

7101
08:01:18,800 --> 08:01:20,560
Um

7102
08:01:20,560 --> 08:01:23,760
And it was just like such a fantastic time and goofing off and

7103
08:01:24,640 --> 08:01:29,280
Yeah, like instant chemistry like uh, I definitely think um

7104
08:01:30,880 --> 08:01:34,960
Because of the nature of the agency as well like no one here is like

7105
08:01:35,440 --> 08:01:38,800
I don't know like judging like oh puritan or whatever

7106
08:01:39,680 --> 08:01:41,680
Like it's just not a thing

7107
08:01:42,480 --> 08:01:44,240
Um

7108
08:01:44,240 --> 08:01:50,960
But yeah, like I just have an absolute fantastic. Oh, I was gonna lose body and I've not done the viewpoint

7109
08:01:52,480 --> 08:01:55,360
But I've spoken so much. I think my tea might be getting cold

7110
08:01:58,880 --> 08:02:00,960
Okay, it's getting cold. I'm gonna hop my tea

7111
08:02:03,120 --> 08:02:06,640
Yeah, like we have her for just collab. Um

7112
08:02:08,960 --> 08:02:10,960
Wait, wait, hold on

7113
08:02:14,240 --> 08:02:20,080
They're destroying that tower automatically update the map because if it did I have

7114
08:02:22,560 --> 08:02:25,600
What we will test it on the next boarder tower

7115
08:02:26,480 --> 08:02:32,400
I think that automatically updated the map and I didn't have to synchronize the viewpoint. You know that

7116
08:02:34,400 --> 08:02:36,400
Oh

7117
08:02:37,120 --> 08:02:39,120
Oh

7118
08:02:41,360 --> 08:02:48,240
How many times have I played this game and I I didn't know that are you coming or not?

7119
08:02:51,040 --> 08:02:53,040
Are you

7120
08:02:54,000 --> 08:02:58,080
Fine, I'll call in another group of assassins to deal with them because what's going on here

7121
08:03:02,720 --> 08:03:04,720
Yeah

7122
08:03:04,960 --> 08:03:09,200
Can you guys help her my goodness. Jeez. She almost perished

7123
08:03:15,360 --> 08:03:19,200
How ironic the the naughty agency ends up is the most wholesome

7124
08:03:19,440 --> 08:03:22,560
Yeah, like I think it's we're all in the same boat and we're just goofing off like

7125
08:03:23,200 --> 08:03:26,800
Um, when the girls were recording their scripts for the first time

7126
08:03:27,200 --> 08:03:30,880
Like they were so nervous and like oh, is this good enough? Is that good enough?

7127
08:03:30,960 --> 08:03:36,960
And I'm like, you have to start from somewhere like um, mercy for example hadn't done anything

7128
08:03:37,680 --> 08:03:41,440
Uh, like that before so she was like so unsure and I was like

7129
08:03:42,640 --> 08:03:46,160
I was sending her homework and it was literally links on the hub

7130
08:03:46,640 --> 08:03:53,280
And I was like just kind of listen to this and give it our uh, what you think and you know, you can add that next time

7131
08:03:53,840 --> 08:03:58,800
It is very interesting giving people homework because the homework is literally on

7132
08:03:59,120 --> 08:04:01,680
Well, you can imagine where

7133
08:04:02,400 --> 08:04:03,680
Um

7134
08:04:03,680 --> 08:04:07,040
But like mercy so hot like everyone just like was having a goof off and

7135
08:04:07,520 --> 08:04:09,520
so good

7136
08:04:09,840 --> 08:04:13,520
Mercy talking about experience to a point. It was so cute. Can't wait to see more from her. Yes

7137
08:04:14,720 --> 08:04:19,840
Um, she let me I don't know if you've seen the artwork on her twitter, but she

7138
08:04:20,880 --> 08:04:22,880
was very, um

7139
08:04:23,600 --> 08:04:25,200
kind to

7140
08:04:25,280 --> 08:04:27,280
Tell me about her

7141
08:04:27,840 --> 08:04:29,840
friendship with um

7142
08:04:30,880 --> 08:04:33,840
In being you I think it's Celestia. I'm so sorry if it's not Celestia

7143
08:04:34,400 --> 08:04:35,280
um

7144
08:04:35,280 --> 08:04:41,600
And I was like just so touched by her story and I was like I might get her a little doodle and surprise her

7145
08:04:42,160 --> 08:04:47,440
And like I sent it to her and I put a little message and I was just like your story really touched me

7146
08:04:48,080 --> 08:04:48,800
um

7147
08:04:48,800 --> 08:04:54,160
And also red string theory is when you were always gonna come together no matter what

7148
08:04:54,240 --> 08:04:56,240
So I had like a little string in the picture

7149
08:04:56,960 --> 08:05:01,680
Uh, and she sent me an audio over crying and I'm like, oh my god. I just made her cry

7150
08:05:02,160 --> 08:05:04,080
I feel so bad

7151
08:05:04,080 --> 08:05:07,920
But she was like it's happy tears. It's happy tears like thank you so much

7152
08:05:08,720 --> 08:05:13,440
Um, and I was like, oh my god. It sounds so terrible at a context like I made her cry

7153
08:05:19,920 --> 08:05:21,920
My girls are all lovely, um

7154
08:05:24,240 --> 08:05:27,200
Definitely great. I'm looking forward to their one-on-one collabs

7155
08:05:28,560 --> 08:05:32,720
Yeah, I can say that we have a group collab and one-on-one collabs this month. Um

7156
08:05:34,000 --> 08:05:35,840
Because we

7157
08:05:35,840 --> 08:05:41,280
Just everything's just gone so fantastic like so amazing couldn't ask for better like

7158
08:05:42,000 --> 08:05:48,400
Um, they've like recorded their video game lines. So that's kind of like the next big thing

7159
08:05:48,480 --> 08:05:54,160
I hope it can be done by next by july. I don't know at what point maybe

7160
08:05:55,440 --> 08:05:59,120
I'm gonna burp. Oh, pardon me for being so rude. It was not me. It was my food

7161
08:05:59,120 --> 08:06:02,160
It just came up to say hello and now it's gone back down below. Um

7162
08:06:04,880 --> 08:06:06,880
Sorry, uh, what was I saying?

7163
08:06:08,400 --> 08:06:12,080
I have completely and truly forgotten what I was saying

7164
08:06:13,200 --> 08:06:15,200
um

7165
08:06:16,080 --> 08:06:23,760
Yeah, the girls have one-on-one collabs this month, which I'm excited and then we have a full big group collab, which I'm very excited about

7166
08:06:24,320 --> 08:06:25,920
um

7167
08:06:25,920 --> 08:06:31,680
And then after that it might kind of be like trio collabs or four man collabs

7168
08:06:32,160 --> 08:06:37,040
Because not every game has six persons possible. Like it's just not happening

7169
08:06:38,160 --> 08:06:40,160
It's not happening

7170
08:06:40,880 --> 08:06:47,280
I don't know why like they watch me just like annihilate all those people. Can I go on this? Can I go on the gay bail?

7171
08:06:48,080 --> 08:06:50,080
Let me hide in here. See they can't get me

7172
08:06:52,240 --> 08:06:54,240
Um

7173
08:06:54,320 --> 08:06:57,920
But yes, unfortunately not all games are gonna come as a date

7174
08:06:58,400 --> 08:07:05,520
Um six people so we're just gonna have to see what's in there the lethal company among us like basically we are so limited

7175
08:07:06,400 --> 08:07:10,960
Uh, I probably shouldn't actually claim this. Yeah, I was gonna say I should not be claiming this right now

7176
08:07:11,280 --> 08:07:13,280
I need to wait until I can get my recruit

7177
08:07:16,000 --> 08:07:19,120
Uh, wait, can I get lost in the hay bails? Stop

7178
08:07:20,720 --> 08:07:24,560
No, you're not supposed to recognize me in the hay bails. Hold on

7179
08:07:26,160 --> 08:07:33,040
I just I need my uh one. I need one assassin recruit. Oh my goodness. I need to buy armor. You know that

7180
08:07:33,920 --> 08:07:37,920
Because that's that is like scary that one. Wow

7181
08:07:39,120 --> 08:07:41,600
Hold on right. There we go. I can actually finally attack

7182
08:07:42,240 --> 08:07:48,640
The problem is if you don't have like got a assassin recruits to help you like they properly go for you

7183
08:07:50,240 --> 08:07:54,800
Sorry, I'm a bit slow. I'm like try talking. Oh my tea. I forgot my tea already

7184
08:07:55,840 --> 08:07:58,800
What's going on? I can't see because of the camera angle

7185
08:08:00,000 --> 08:08:02,000
Yeah, take that as we get for annoying me

7186
08:08:03,040 --> 08:08:05,040
Sir lands a lot more like sir

7187
08:08:06,160 --> 08:08:08,640
Sir spurts a lot of blood

7188
08:08:09,280 --> 08:08:13,680
Ha ha I got him. Okay. Let me finish my tea. Oh no momento, please

7189
08:08:25,520 --> 08:08:28,320
Yep, that's honey tea. All right made by myself

7190
08:08:29,040 --> 08:08:31,040
Um

7191
08:08:33,920 --> 08:08:41,200
Um, I think it's just called black tea or uh regular breakfast English tea is what it what it is

7192
08:08:44,800 --> 08:08:46,800
And then just some milk and honey

7193
08:08:46,960 --> 08:08:48,960
Uh

7194
08:08:54,400 --> 08:08:58,480
Right, I need to climb this so I will I will

7195
08:08:59,840 --> 08:09:01,840
I will claim it by identifying

7196
08:09:02,080 --> 08:09:05,760
I really need to buy the Leonardo glove because this stuff would be so much easier

7197
08:09:06,160 --> 08:09:10,000
Right, we are going to test it. The map is not unlocked. I repeat

7198
08:09:10,720 --> 08:09:13,600
The map is not unlocked, which means

7199
08:09:14,240 --> 08:09:16,240
Then you go left then you go right

7200
08:09:17,360 --> 08:09:21,040
No, I can't go right. I have to go left right. I'll go left then. Um

7201
08:09:25,520 --> 08:09:27,520
Wait

7202
08:09:28,160 --> 08:09:31,680
Am I going crazy or can I not claim this without gloves?

7203
08:09:34,320 --> 08:09:36,320
Hey

7204
08:09:37,120 --> 08:09:43,600
Wait, I actually need gloves to work. I don't recall needing gloves to do this. Is it this?

7205
08:09:43,840 --> 08:09:50,560
Okay, this looks like it. Yeah, this looks like it. Holy moley moley. Wait up. Wait up over here

7206
08:09:50,800 --> 08:09:57,040
My goodness, this tower is uh, very uniqueness nature. That took me a whole second together

7207
08:09:57,760 --> 08:10:03,040
You burp from tea a burp from everything if I eat a burp of a talk a burp

7208
08:10:03,680 --> 08:10:07,680
Uh, I seem to like gulp air when I breathe unfortunately, which

7209
08:10:08,480 --> 08:10:10,480
Leads to all of this

7210
08:10:11,120 --> 08:10:15,200
I knew I could hear that. Yeah. Well, I don't want to go get it right now. So

7211
08:10:16,160 --> 08:10:18,160
Bye

7212
08:10:20,160 --> 08:10:24,160
Uh, yes

7213
08:10:27,040 --> 08:10:29,040
Hmm

7214
08:10:29,280 --> 08:10:31,280
Okay arrow storm is back

7215
08:10:33,120 --> 08:10:38,800
Okay, we are not doing the viewpoint because if I ignite this and it unlocks on the map

7216
08:10:39,040 --> 08:10:41,920
I've learned something new about my game yet again

7217
08:10:45,200 --> 08:10:49,280
I'm learning I'm learning does it unlock the map

7218
08:10:49,280 --> 08:10:51,280
Uh

7219
08:10:59,840 --> 08:11:01,840
It's true

7220
08:11:01,840 --> 08:11:08,160
It unlocks the map. Oh, I just realized I'm covering up the map, but it unlocks the map if you do destroy the tower

7221
08:11:09,200 --> 08:11:11,760
You're still playing. I never stop them

7222
08:11:12,800 --> 08:11:14,800
We've got one more board just on to liberate

7223
08:11:15,760 --> 08:11:17,760
Yeah

7224
08:11:17,760 --> 08:11:20,800
It appears there is a citizen that requires our help

7225
08:11:21,680 --> 08:11:23,680
Allow me citizen

7226
08:11:23,760 --> 08:11:25,760
Let him go eagle sound

7227
08:11:26,240 --> 08:11:28,240
Oh, that was not an eagle sound at all

7228
08:11:29,360 --> 08:11:33,760
Hello, I am your knight in training armor. It's the auditoria da fedenze

7229
08:11:36,240 --> 08:11:38,240
Deliberation of roma has begun

7230
08:11:39,280 --> 08:11:41,280
It's running built

7231
08:11:42,480 --> 08:11:44,480
Yeah, allow me to follow you

7232
08:11:45,360 --> 08:11:49,680
Started streaming squints eight hours ago. Yeah, I like my game

7233
08:11:50,560 --> 08:11:56,480
Uh, especially if it's a video game that I have an a tendency for uh, this game

7234
08:11:56,720 --> 08:11:59,280
I probably played it the most out of all games. So

7235
08:12:00,000 --> 08:12:02,800
So it's very easy for me to be like

7236
08:12:05,600 --> 08:12:09,680
With the game actually I should be unlocking these tunnel entrances

7237
08:12:10,240 --> 08:12:17,920
For fast travel, but I'm a bit lazy. We'll buy some buildings just because I have so much money in me pocket

7238
08:12:19,920 --> 08:12:24,800
Uh, how many runs in this game it is impossible to say like

7239
08:12:26,240 --> 08:12:31,680
I probably could comfortably say like over a hundred times just like casually

7240
08:12:32,880 --> 08:12:35,840
Playing it doing different strategies like some

7241
08:12:36,640 --> 08:12:40,880
Strategy I'll say strategies and brackets. So when the game started

7242
08:12:40,960 --> 08:12:47,360
I would like purposely buy all the areas I possibly could and then finish the next act and then unlock everything in that area

7243
08:12:47,360 --> 08:12:48,880
then

7244
08:12:48,880 --> 08:12:49,680
um

7245
08:12:49,680 --> 08:12:56,240
Like completely ignore all the monetary aspects and just go with the weakest weapons or like fully equip them out and

7246
08:12:56,640 --> 08:12:58,960
Like just all these different variations

7247
08:12:59,920 --> 08:13:07,120
Um, I did try black flag. Sadly I suck. Um, and I really struggled to get into it

7248
08:13:07,520 --> 08:13:13,360
I am very by I I just absolutely mogged to that older woman there. I don't know if you saw that

7249
08:13:14,880 --> 08:13:19,600
I just smashed into her. Um, I did play black flag. I'm rubbish

7250
08:13:21,280 --> 08:13:26,160
If someone has never played any assassin screen games, should I start at the beginning of the series or the series?

7251
08:13:26,160 --> 08:13:28,160
We can jump in at once. Ooh

7252
08:13:28,160 --> 08:13:31,360
That's a harder question to answer

7253
08:13:33,600 --> 08:13:35,600
I

7254
08:13:36,320 --> 08:13:38,320
Think you're

7255
08:13:38,880 --> 08:13:40,880
Hmm

7256
08:13:44,320 --> 08:13:47,120
From my completely biased standpoint

7257
08:13:47,760 --> 08:13:53,680
Um, I believe you should start at Assassin's Creed Brotherhood to understand the type of game it is

7258
08:13:54,080 --> 08:13:58,640
Assassin's Creed Brotherhood is the easiest game to play in the series in my opinion

7259
08:13:59,040 --> 08:14:03,200
However, you are going to start in the middle of the story of Ezio

7260
08:14:03,760 --> 08:14:07,520
If you do want to play Assassin's Creed 2, it's not impossible

7261
08:14:08,080 --> 08:14:13,520
Um, but you don't have assassin recruits, for example to help you out in a fight. Um, you are on your own

7262
08:14:13,760 --> 08:14:16,640
You do have mercenaries that you can buy on the street

7263
08:14:17,200 --> 08:14:23,600
To help you out. It's not impossible. Definitely don't be discouraged. Um, but my recommendation is

7264
08:14:23,840 --> 08:14:25,840
Ezio's storyline

7265
08:14:26,160 --> 08:14:33,600
Which is Assassin's Creed 2, Assassin's Creed Brotherhood and Assassin's Creed Revelations overall very easy games to play

7266
08:14:34,160 --> 08:14:36,160
Revelations got a bit

7267
08:14:36,160 --> 08:14:38,160
um

7268
08:14:38,720 --> 08:14:42,800
In my humble opinion, uh revelations

7269
08:14:43,840 --> 08:14:48,000
Kind of went a bit too far with the notoriety aspect

7270
08:14:48,960 --> 08:14:50,960
um

7271
08:14:51,040 --> 08:14:57,360
I understand that you can't just have the same game over and over in every installment. I do comprehend that

7272
08:14:58,080 --> 08:14:59,200
but um

7273
08:14:59,200 --> 08:15:05,360
The way they did notoriety and revelations was every time you renovated a building in the district

7274
08:15:06,000 --> 08:15:09,760
That the assassins owned your notoriety goes up

7275
08:15:10,320 --> 08:15:16,480
And the district is more than likely to be attacked and if you don't defend it you lose it and

7276
08:15:16,560 --> 08:15:18,560
And

7277
08:15:18,800 --> 08:15:26,000
In the nicest way, I don't like gameplay like that. I like to be like, ah, I feel accomplished

7278
08:15:26,000 --> 08:15:28,240
Like I've just renovated that aqueduct there

7279
08:15:28,880 --> 08:15:34,560
I feel accomplished because I know I don't have to redo it. It's not gonna get lost

7280
08:15:34,960 --> 08:15:36,640
I'm not gonna have any issues

7281
08:15:37,200 --> 08:15:42,800
Um, but I do understand that people like a challenge in their video games or they might enjoy

7282
08:15:43,760 --> 08:15:45,760
um kind of that

7283
08:15:46,000 --> 08:15:52,080
Aspect of having to fight back for something like you it's not just earned and it's not just that easy

7284
08:15:52,160 --> 08:15:54,160
Like no, you have to fight for it. You have to

7285
08:15:54,800 --> 08:15:58,960
You have a chance to lose that you have an opportunity to get in trouble type thing

7286
08:16:00,080 --> 08:16:03,600
Um, jeez. What was that achievement airstrike maybe?

7287
08:16:04,720 --> 08:16:06,400
um

7288
08:16:06,400 --> 08:16:08,400
I know 73 florans

7289
08:16:09,360 --> 08:16:10,720
eh

7290
08:16:10,720 --> 08:16:14,560
The game's having a rough time right now. I think I'm I'm asking it to do a lot

7291
08:16:15,200 --> 08:16:17,200
Oh, I'm going past the tower. Oh well

7292
08:16:17,760 --> 08:16:22,320
Hello. Bye. Bye. Hello. Bye. Bye. Hello

7293
08:16:23,360 --> 08:16:25,360
America

7294
08:16:26,480 --> 08:16:31,920
Uh, I hate this part with oh my goodness. It's a party on the rooftop, huh?

7295
08:16:33,040 --> 08:16:41,760
Let me get this tower. Ow my back. Hello. You're hitting my clavicle from the back. That's not very nice

7296
08:16:42,640 --> 08:16:44,640
Ah, stop it

7297
08:16:44,960 --> 08:16:49,360
Oh freaking sick. He didn't die. Oh, I need to wait for my recruits to come and help me

7298
08:16:51,680 --> 08:16:57,200
Why why why would you change camera right there game? I'm getting trolled right now

7299
08:16:58,480 --> 08:17:00,480
I think I'm just getting tired as well

7300
08:17:01,680 --> 08:17:03,680
Oh, I love to kill cams

7301
08:17:04,720 --> 08:17:05,840
No

7302
08:17:05,840 --> 08:17:09,360
Off him right. I'm calling in my recruits. They're gonna come help

7303
08:17:10,240 --> 08:17:13,280
As soon as like the AI can pick on someone else

7304
08:17:13,360 --> 08:17:17,840
It just becomes so easy to take them down one by one. Ow my back again

7305
08:17:18,560 --> 08:17:21,440
Would you kindly stop my goodness?

7306
08:17:22,320 --> 08:17:24,320
And I got a thief's guilt for that

7307
08:17:24,640 --> 08:17:26,800
Oh, I've still not done poison. That's a really easy one

7308
08:17:28,000 --> 08:17:32,720
How many okay, I have one bottle of medicine left. I was gonna say I actually don't feel like I've like

7309
08:17:33,360 --> 08:17:35,360
Looted at all

7310
08:17:36,080 --> 08:17:38,080
Hmm

7311
08:17:38,400 --> 08:17:41,520
I've never heard of a scotch video game nerd ran and it's perfect

7312
08:17:42,880 --> 08:17:44,880
Oh, literally like, uh

7313
08:17:45,040 --> 08:17:49,200
Skyrim's probably the next rambly game. I'm gonna play

7314
08:17:50,320 --> 08:17:57,520
Um, and just like tell you like all the things I know about the game and like uh gameplay that I've found interesting or good

7315
08:17:58,880 --> 08:18:00,880
um

7316
08:18:01,120 --> 08:18:04,800
I wouldn't mind playing cult of the lamb again. That was very enjoyable

7317
08:18:05,520 --> 08:18:09,600
Um, I can't yapp about it much though because I'm not I don't know much

7318
08:18:09,600 --> 08:18:13,200
I've only played it once but I really enjoyed it and it was a 10 out of 10

7319
08:18:14,000 --> 08:18:16,000
pardon me experience

7320
08:18:16,480 --> 08:18:21,920
Pardon me for being so rude. It was not me. It was my I have played shadow of mordor

7321
08:18:22,720 --> 08:18:24,880
and

7322
08:18:24,880 --> 08:18:28,240
I haven't like perfectly completed it or anything

7323
08:18:28,720 --> 08:18:31,920
But I would absolutely love to play that again

7324
08:18:32,160 --> 08:18:34,640
I want to give the golem game a shot as well

7325
08:18:35,120 --> 08:18:41,200
It's like such a oh, we got an achievement called tower of fence by the way because we just successfully

7326
08:18:42,080 --> 08:18:43,600
renovate renovate

7327
08:18:43,600 --> 08:18:44,480
um

7328
08:18:44,480 --> 08:18:48,160
destroyed all bourgeois influence on roma

7329
08:18:49,120 --> 08:18:55,280
So now we can successfully renovate everything on the map like on this part of the map. We can like buy everything

7330
08:18:55,920 --> 08:19:00,880
um, so i'm gonna fill up the recruits and uh, we'll buy some

7331
08:19:01,360 --> 08:19:03,360
locations and stuff

7332
08:19:04,480 --> 08:19:07,840
Was it literally everyone hated the golem game, but I'm like

7333
08:19:08,880 --> 08:19:11,280
I mean I assume they've had a few updates

7334
08:19:12,080 --> 08:19:14,080
from the bugs of the game

7335
08:19:15,200 --> 08:19:19,760
Oh, I've got a lot of baby assassins right here. Hmm, right. Oh

7336
08:19:20,880 --> 08:19:26,000
I'll recruit the last assassin wherever they may be. There's no one nearby

7337
08:19:26,560 --> 08:19:31,120
Um, we will start this top corner. Why not?

7338
08:19:32,800 --> 08:19:37,760
Uh, and we'll start renovating unless we do a layer of romulus

7339
08:19:38,720 --> 08:19:40,880
We could maybe do that like now

7340
08:19:42,640 --> 08:19:44,640
I don't mind

7341
08:19:47,680 --> 08:19:51,520
Well, you've been streaming the entire time I've been awake. I've been

7342
08:19:52,320 --> 08:20:01,360
At correction you fool. I've been nerding about my games that I love for eight hours. Haha. You think this is work

7343
08:20:01,760 --> 08:20:03,760
I'll show you work

7344
08:20:05,200 --> 08:20:07,040
Wait, um

7345
08:20:07,040 --> 08:20:12,160
The only reason like I'm able to like do it for so long is because you guys literally listen to me

7346
08:20:12,240 --> 08:20:14,240
Yeah, but about it for so long

7347
08:20:14,800 --> 08:20:18,800
Like it's just a good time. I'm having a good time. Um

7348
08:20:19,360 --> 08:20:23,120
And it's just nice being able to um

7349
08:20:24,800 --> 08:20:28,320
Just share like what I'm passionate about and

7350
08:20:31,760 --> 08:20:38,160
Graphics wise this game looks better than golem like does it actually this game is 14 years old

7351
08:20:40,720 --> 08:20:44,160
Unless yes refling we will fight back

7352
08:20:46,000 --> 08:20:48,000
No more shall we be

7353
08:20:48,240 --> 08:20:50,240
Uh, right hold on

7354
08:20:51,360 --> 08:20:52,640
I don't

7355
08:20:52,640 --> 08:20:56,720
The best way to go about renovating I think is doing the districts

7356
08:20:56,880 --> 08:21:01,760
So we're gonna start with this district first. Okay, so we'll just take it from the top

7357
08:21:02,160 --> 08:21:05,040
And we're gonna buy everything in the game

7358
08:21:05,680 --> 08:21:10,000
I can't believe assassin's creed brotherhood is actually just capitalist simulator

7359
08:21:10,400 --> 08:21:14,320
Because look at us now. We had no money at the start and money begets more money

7360
08:21:14,320 --> 08:21:17,200
You know what I'm saying and don't be confused with baguette

7361
08:21:18,000 --> 08:21:20,160
Beget baguettes as in

7362
08:21:21,040 --> 08:21:23,040
more

7363
08:21:23,600 --> 08:21:26,880
Um, I can't believe this game's just hidden money maker similar

7364
08:21:28,400 --> 08:21:30,400
They've sucked me in

7365
08:21:30,400 --> 08:21:32,400
I like really enjoy money making games

7366
08:21:33,040 --> 08:21:35,040
I just think I'm so fun

7367
08:21:35,600 --> 08:21:36,960
um

7368
08:21:36,960 --> 08:21:38,960
I did want to get into

7369
08:21:40,400 --> 08:21:42,400
Not me game developing

7370
08:21:42,880 --> 08:21:47,120
But me commissioning a game like being a studio

7371
08:21:48,480 --> 08:21:50,000
But I don't know what that's called

7372
08:21:50,000 --> 08:21:57,360
It's not like a publisher because you don't need publishers because publishers are what used to pay for the hard copy of like the xbox games and stuff like that

7373
08:21:58,000 --> 08:21:59,120
um

7374
08:21:59,120 --> 08:22:04,240
Like I might get into that at some point not right now. No, dude. So it's not right now

7375
08:22:05,600 --> 08:22:10,880
Um, like an investor. Yeah, like I will like go to like a gaming

7376
08:22:11,600 --> 08:22:15,600
Um, like developer and be like, hey, do you want to make this?

7377
08:22:16,480 --> 08:22:17,920
um

7378
08:22:17,920 --> 08:22:21,360
And basically they go, yeah, this is how much and I'll be like, okay

7379
08:22:21,840 --> 08:22:27,040
We will do this deal where you get this much and royalties and I get this much like that

7380
08:22:28,560 --> 08:22:30,560
I think it'll be kill

7381
08:22:31,280 --> 08:22:33,280
Make one scrawny

7382
08:22:33,440 --> 08:22:35,440
million dollars

7383
08:22:36,320 --> 08:22:38,320
any

7384
08:22:38,400 --> 08:22:40,400
scrawny stonks

7385
08:22:41,520 --> 08:22:44,080
I could listen to your ample of games for days

7386
08:22:45,040 --> 08:22:46,320
Hmm

7387
08:22:46,320 --> 08:22:48,320
What game ideas do you have in mind?

7388
08:22:48,960 --> 08:22:50,160
Well

7389
08:22:50,160 --> 08:22:57,120
So I really enjoy cookie clicker. However, I don't enjoy the aspect of cookie clicker

7390
08:22:57,760 --> 08:23:04,880
That is the game is so hard to finish and feel like ah, I have achieved the ending of this game

7391
08:23:04,960 --> 08:23:06,240
I am satisfied

7392
08:23:06,240 --> 08:23:08,800
So I wanted to develop a cookie clicker

7393
08:23:09,280 --> 08:23:12,960
That's like a four hour game because because because

7394
08:23:13,840 --> 08:23:20,640
VTubers and streamers need games that kind of wrap up in four hours

7395
08:23:21,200 --> 08:23:25,840
Like I think and I think there's definitely like a market for that kind of thing

7396
08:23:26,320 --> 08:23:31,120
Um, so it'd be very interesting to like find out the formulaic thing in the background

7397
08:23:31,200 --> 08:23:36,080
But obviously you need like more of a twist. You can't just make cookie clicker and then it ends fast like that's not how it works

7398
08:23:36,800 --> 08:23:38,800
uh cookie clicker game

7399
08:23:39,600 --> 08:23:41,600
is a number

7400
08:23:43,280 --> 08:23:44,720
game

7401
08:23:44,720 --> 08:23:45,920
where

7402
08:23:45,920 --> 08:23:50,160
You start with like no money for example or no cookies

7403
08:23:50,800 --> 08:23:54,880
and then you upgrade stuff via the cookies and

7404
08:23:55,440 --> 08:23:59,680
It makes more cookies and the numbers go up. I can't remember the type of game

7405
08:24:00,560 --> 08:24:02,560
it's called

7406
08:24:02,560 --> 08:24:03,920
uh

7407
08:24:03,920 --> 08:24:05,520
incremental game I

7408
08:24:05,520 --> 08:24:07,520
an incremental game

7409
08:24:07,920 --> 08:24:12,880
Is what cookie clicker is and I think there's definitely a market

7410
08:24:13,280 --> 08:24:19,680
For an incremental game that you can wrap up in four hours if it had a storyline of some sort

7411
08:24:20,400 --> 08:24:21,440
um

7412
08:24:21,440 --> 08:24:26,880
As well as like a replayability factor as well. I definitely think

7413
08:24:27,520 --> 08:24:32,880
There's a market for like four hour games, especially for VTubers and streamers and um

7414
08:24:33,840 --> 08:24:38,480
It would definitely be interesting to like go through it together now. I'm definitely nowhere

7415
08:24:39,360 --> 08:24:41,360
near doing any of that and

7416
08:24:42,160 --> 08:24:49,520
Like I don't even know where you start and it just becomes crazy legal stuff and

7417
08:24:50,400 --> 08:24:51,520
uh

7418
08:24:51,520 --> 08:24:59,120
Just to say the development of VLR took over a year and a lot of stress and a lot of like

7419
08:24:59,840 --> 08:25:05,360
Issues on the road like things are not straightforward. It's just impossible

7420
08:25:06,320 --> 08:25:08,320
to be straightforward

7421
08:25:08,320 --> 08:25:13,360
Uh when it comes to these things and I'm not wanting any stress right now

7422
08:25:13,440 --> 08:25:19,680
I just want to enjoy streaming like it took so long to get here. So no, we're not doing VLR

7423
08:25:20,320 --> 08:25:23,200
Uh game development arc. No

7424
08:25:23,920 --> 08:25:26,880
And for the game the free to play game that does come out

7425
08:25:27,600 --> 08:25:29,840
again, it was created by

7426
08:25:30,960 --> 08:25:33,760
Not like an outside source studio

7427
08:25:35,760 --> 08:25:40,080
Type thing. So I guess I've technically already done that. I mean

7428
08:25:41,120 --> 08:25:42,880
This game isn't for profit though

7429
08:25:42,880 --> 08:25:47,200
So I guess like when it comes to like profit games like marketing would have to go into it

7430
08:25:47,280 --> 08:25:49,440
Like all these different factors would have to go into it

7431
08:25:49,760 --> 08:25:56,560
But it's definitely something like I'm happy and open to talk about like especially the newest game that we're developing for VLR right now

7432
08:25:57,120 --> 08:25:58,000
and

7433
08:25:58,000 --> 08:26:04,080
Once it comes out. I'm happy to talk about the development, but I don't think it'll be surprised to anyone to

7434
08:26:04,960 --> 08:26:09,280
For me to not be able to show much of the content of the game

7435
08:26:10,080 --> 08:26:16,160
Oh, I don't think anyone's gonna be surprised. So don't think I'm gonna get like charts out and show like

7436
08:26:16,560 --> 08:26:20,400
These are the mock designs behind the scenes. No

7437
08:26:21,360 --> 08:26:23,360
I can't show that

7438
08:26:24,560 --> 08:26:26,560
It's not appropriate

7439
08:26:28,240 --> 08:26:30,880
Um, yes, it should hopefully come out in july

7440
08:26:31,440 --> 08:26:37,280
Um, it still looks like it is gonna happen in july. So that'll be our big announcement in july

7441
08:26:37,920 --> 08:26:39,920
for be a lower

7442
08:26:40,320 --> 08:26:42,400
And then we start getting to the other stuff

7443
08:26:43,280 --> 08:26:47,040
Just we've linked some vibe and literally there is a lot of lost time

7444
08:26:48,160 --> 08:26:53,520
And yeah, I surely it's uh able to play it on stream. Yeah

7445
08:26:54,400 --> 08:26:56,240
totally

7446
08:26:56,240 --> 08:26:58,240
Yeah

7447
08:26:59,200 --> 08:27:07,280
Yeah, no the game is absolutely fine to be streamed absolutely no issues at all empty faction building

7448
08:27:12,560 --> 08:27:14,560
Mm-hmm

7449
08:27:17,360 --> 08:27:21,360
What platforms um, it's gonna be itchio

7450
08:27:23,200 --> 08:27:25,600
Which is not how anyone reads it, but that's how I read it

7451
08:27:26,160 --> 08:27:29,280
Uh, so we're at the mercenaries location

7452
08:27:29,840 --> 08:27:32,160
So obviously the only logical faction

7453
08:27:33,040 --> 08:27:39,540
For like the mercenaries place like where all the the beefed up macho men are a bit stress relief for the courtesans

7454
08:27:39,620 --> 08:27:41,620
Eh

7455
08:27:41,860 --> 08:27:44,420
I have always put the courtesans here

7456
08:27:45,060 --> 08:27:48,420
Uh, you know, come on these the mercenaries need some

7457
08:27:49,220 --> 08:27:52,980
Some tlc and we'll bear to do that than the courtesans

7458
08:27:55,300 --> 08:27:59,140
Uh, we do have an aqueduct in this area

7459
08:27:59,220 --> 08:28:02,260
I know it's like we've kind of done this little quadrant here as well

7460
08:28:03,140 --> 08:28:05,140
Uh, and we did do that

7461
08:28:05,700 --> 08:28:08,180
maybe we'll like do the outside of the map and then

7462
08:28:09,620 --> 08:28:11,620
Where the heck am I supposed to go?

7463
08:28:14,820 --> 08:28:17,780
Wait, it was highlighted. Why can't I see on my map?

7464
08:28:20,340 --> 08:28:22,340
eto

7465
08:28:23,140 --> 08:28:25,140
Hello, I know

7466
08:28:27,460 --> 08:28:29,460
A brotherhood are you showing your age?

7467
08:28:30,820 --> 08:28:32,660
Oh

7468
08:28:32,660 --> 08:28:37,700
I was bam boozled. It wasn't highlighted properly

7469
08:28:39,780 --> 08:28:42,660
Mercenaries could have been a good mercy fan name

7470
08:28:44,820 --> 08:28:47,700
Would a young dairy have guns like that like

7471
08:28:48,500 --> 08:28:50,260
She'll have gunners

7472
08:28:50,260 --> 08:28:51,700
but guns

7473
08:28:51,700 --> 08:28:53,220
nah

7474
08:28:53,220 --> 08:28:55,220
Yeah

7475
08:28:56,420 --> 08:29:00,020
I could see you doing a game like ducky ducky. I've never played ducky ducky

7476
08:29:00,900 --> 08:29:06,260
I think a lot of youtubers have though. Um, but maybe like I think there's

7477
08:29:07,220 --> 08:29:13,140
Four girls in that game. So maybe uh veal or like reading voice over thing could be a thing

7478
08:29:16,420 --> 08:29:18,420
Hey

7479
08:29:22,820 --> 08:29:29,460
Uh, right we've done this kind of section this one here. So we'll do this bottom corner. Oh, there's Leonardo. We go

7480
08:29:29,780 --> 08:29:31,780
We can purchase the glove

7481
08:29:32,660 --> 08:29:34,900
I need the glove for climbing reasons

7482
08:29:34,980 --> 08:29:36,980
No other reason

7483
08:29:39,620 --> 08:29:42,660
I promise the glove is for wholesome intentions

7484
08:29:44,340 --> 08:29:46,340
And to suggest otherwise

7485
08:29:49,940 --> 08:29:51,940
Wait, aw

7486
08:29:52,260 --> 08:29:56,740
Riding around in my game looking at the sun is so bootyful

7487
08:29:58,180 --> 08:30:00,020
What a beautiful

7488
08:30:00,100 --> 08:30:04,420
Recreation of roma back in back in yield days before the internet became a thing

7489
08:30:07,300 --> 08:30:11,060
But how would uh, how could you stream if you were back then?

7490
08:30:12,660 --> 08:30:17,460
I guess be a stage presence. Excuse me, mr. Horster in the way

7491
08:30:22,340 --> 08:30:27,620
Friendly reminder to not lose sleep. Yeah, if you guys need to rest or you need to go, please don't worry

7492
08:30:28,580 --> 08:30:34,740
Mercy's going live in 30 minutes any mercy modist watchers also known as karambit

7493
08:30:36,020 --> 08:30:42,180
Uh, any karambit warning in 30 minutes, but please do rest if you need to

7494
08:30:43,460 --> 08:30:46,820
Or hydrate to you know, actually I'm going to take a sleep

7495
08:30:48,580 --> 08:30:50,920
Oh, I'm me. Oh, sorry

7496
08:30:51,320 --> 08:30:53,320
Okay

7497
08:30:54,840 --> 08:30:59,960
So you cannot access this viewpoint if you do not repair the aqueduct here

7498
08:31:00,760 --> 08:31:06,760
Which I thought was a pretty neat thing because the game's kind of like hint hint mate. You need to repair stuff

7499
08:31:07,640 --> 08:31:12,920
And then you'll earn income because I'm sure a lot of people kind of played and missed that part of like you can

7500
08:31:13,320 --> 08:31:16,200
Renovate buildings and that's how you get money in the game money

7501
08:31:17,160 --> 08:31:19,160
We

7502
08:31:19,480 --> 08:31:26,600
This game is my second fave before black flag. Yeah black flag certainly captured a lot of people's hearts

7503
08:31:27,320 --> 08:31:29,320
Like oh no

7504
08:31:29,800 --> 08:31:35,640
I forgot it was that jump. I normally struggle to get out of this place so much

7505
08:31:36,840 --> 08:31:39,880
Oh, can I remember how to get out?

7506
08:31:41,080 --> 08:31:43,080
Wait, was it that easy

7507
08:31:43,880 --> 08:31:45,880
to get out

7508
08:31:45,880 --> 08:31:47,880
No

7509
08:31:48,680 --> 08:31:50,680
Yes

7510
08:31:50,680 --> 08:31:51,800
Yes

7511
08:31:51,800 --> 08:31:56,440
Okay, it must have been chilled me because I like never do that like I never go down there

7512
08:31:56,520 --> 08:32:00,520
So it must have been chilled me that really struggled to get out there. I just remember being like

7513
08:32:01,960 --> 08:32:03,960
Back for more designs again

7514
08:32:05,240 --> 08:32:10,760
The Scottish accent making me think differently. What is rest streamer don't

7515
08:32:11,640 --> 08:32:13,640
stream now there we go

7516
08:32:14,600 --> 08:32:23,080
Claim leap glove this reinforced glove allows for faster claiming giving the wearer the strength easily grab handhold many mid-jump

7517
08:32:23,720 --> 08:32:27,960
Handholds mid-jump. It also deals more damage to enemies when fistfading

7518
08:32:30,360 --> 08:32:32,360
Wait here, I'll be back soon

7519
08:32:37,720 --> 08:32:40,680
Yeah, maybe we should get black flag like a really good goal

7520
08:32:41,240 --> 08:32:45,880
Because people seem to just adore it and I've tried it twice to get into it and

7521
08:32:46,680 --> 08:32:49,960
I don't think I beat like an hour now. Nothing will be out of my reach

7522
08:32:50,360 --> 08:32:56,200
No, nothing going bring out on my match. Uh, I think we can oh we can I was gonna say

7523
08:32:56,200 --> 08:32:58,700
I think we can buy the poison darts as well

7524
08:33:05,080 --> 08:33:07,800
I don't know if there's like a sea shanty or anything

7525
08:33:10,840 --> 08:33:14,360
Only a fool could walk past my shop without a decent quick look

7526
08:33:14,920 --> 08:33:16,920
Only a fool

7527
08:33:17,480 --> 08:33:19,480
Night night rest well those who are resting

7528
08:33:21,080 --> 08:33:24,440
Please don't worry about not making it. Uh, I'm very

7529
08:33:25,880 --> 08:33:27,880
I'm very uh, unfriendly

7530
08:33:33,400 --> 08:33:38,680
Uh, right, we're just gonna run buying things. Oh my goodness

7531
08:33:39,640 --> 08:33:46,360
Society all norms. I can't get away from that. I'm such a girl going around buying things man. These gender norms go hands

7532
08:33:47,240 --> 08:33:48,760
ah

7533
08:33:48,760 --> 08:33:52,040
Stop it. Stop it. The gender norms are winning

7534
08:33:53,320 --> 08:33:57,800
Wait, is this the game where you get the wish and well achievement? Oh it is

7535
08:33:58,680 --> 08:34:04,440
I just remembered that holy moly moly. I just remembered that wish and well achievement

7536
08:34:09,400 --> 08:34:13,560
Okay, uh, this looks like a thief's district. So I'll just make it thieves

7537
08:34:19,080 --> 08:34:23,240
Nine thousand florins every

7538
08:34:24,600 --> 08:34:29,000
20 minutes. I'm in the money. Right. I renovated that but it's not

7539
08:34:30,120 --> 08:34:34,520
Updating on the map, but that's okay. And then we'll kind of sweep around these section

7540
08:34:34,680 --> 08:34:38,680
Like maybe we should go outside the map and then in the center. I'm not sure

7541
08:34:42,280 --> 08:34:45,080
There's a war going on for their benefit

7542
08:34:48,040 --> 08:34:52,600
Did you know there's a war going on for their benefit?

7543
08:34:55,240 --> 08:34:58,840
I think odyssey might be my favorite. I didn't get chance to see

7544
08:34:59,320 --> 08:35:03,080
Yeah, I'm you still playing mommy. I mean mommy. I mean mommy

7545
08:35:05,000 --> 08:35:13,960
Yeah, we finished the campaign. So now we are going around and buying everything we can in sight because these gender norms have hands

7546
08:35:14,520 --> 08:35:16,200
um

7547
08:35:16,200 --> 08:35:18,200
But it means

7548
08:35:18,600 --> 08:35:22,680
We are getting more progress to the hundred percent

7549
08:35:23,480 --> 08:35:26,280
For tomorrow because hopefully we can hundred percent the game

7550
08:35:26,280 --> 08:35:30,120
Which is actually crazy because I've never done it before after considering how many times I've played this game

7551
08:35:30,600 --> 08:35:34,120
I I'm going to send my recruits to get a bit stronger because

7552
08:35:35,400 --> 08:35:40,120
They aren't actually all that strong right if I take you

7553
08:35:41,400 --> 08:35:43,400
Can you take some of these?

7554
08:35:43,880 --> 08:35:45,880
Pete maybe

7555
08:35:46,440 --> 08:35:48,440
Do like that

7556
08:35:48,920 --> 08:35:51,480
Do you get hundred and sixty five each?

7557
08:35:53,400 --> 08:35:57,720
You know what that'll still level up her that's just fine

7558
08:35:59,160 --> 08:36:01,320
Level four and then do that

7559
08:36:02,600 --> 08:36:06,200
And that and that and send them away

7560
08:36:07,160 --> 08:36:11,160
And then do a level three mission

7561
08:36:12,200 --> 08:36:15,640
Don't be shy level three mission. I know you're out there

7562
08:36:16,600 --> 08:36:18,600
Don't be scared

7563
08:36:18,760 --> 08:36:24,360
Okay, level one you go with level seven and you share the xp

7564
08:36:25,320 --> 08:36:30,760
And then level three. Yes take two together

7565
08:36:32,120 --> 08:36:34,280
Okay, just take her as well

7566
08:36:35,560 --> 08:36:39,240
And then level one mission off your pulp. Okay. We did it

7567
08:36:40,360 --> 08:36:43,960
Our assassins are all being leveled up and we're getting all the money for

7568
08:36:45,640 --> 08:36:47,640
Oh

7569
08:36:49,160 --> 08:36:54,440
I've been trying to think of a marrow to send you but man excited go ahead. Don't worry. I'm brain dead

7570
08:36:54,440 --> 08:36:56,440
You don't have to be scared of me. Um

7571
08:36:56,920 --> 08:37:03,640
Some people came to get like brain worms or they're like, oh, she's gonna hate me because I said this or I did this one thing

7572
08:37:04,040 --> 08:37:06,040
I'm not like that. Um

7573
08:37:06,360 --> 08:37:11,800
Hopefully if you are nervous and you're just watching and you're just a lurker for now, that's fine

7574
08:37:11,880 --> 08:37:15,960
But hopefully over time you can kind of just see how we're vibing and

7575
08:37:16,520 --> 08:37:21,640
You maybe get the confidence to talk but uh, hi lurkers. It's okay if you're shy

7576
08:37:22,120 --> 08:37:29,720
I'm not gonna. I'm not gonna like call you out or be mean or stinky or anything. It's perfectly fine to be shy and um

7577
08:37:31,080 --> 08:37:36,360
If you're needing to just hang out and have some background noise on I um

7578
08:37:37,160 --> 08:37:39,800
Uh, very thankful that you picked me to be your background

7579
08:37:42,360 --> 08:37:44,360
I

7580
08:37:44,840 --> 08:37:48,680
Like the vibe so far just being child. Yeah, listen. It's casual. You don't have to

7581
08:37:49,320 --> 08:37:53,560
No audience participation necessary. You can be as close as you like

7582
08:37:53,640 --> 08:37:58,280
You can be attached at the hip or you can be an arm's length whatever is comfortable for you

7583
08:37:58,840 --> 08:38:03,560
I'm just happy that you're happy and if you're not happy

7584
08:38:04,120 --> 08:38:05,800
I have five

7585
08:38:05,800 --> 08:38:11,080
Lovely girls who would love to also entertain you in their own special way

7586
08:38:12,040 --> 08:38:16,440
And I would love for you to check them out if you're just like, ah, I don't think this is quite for me

7587
08:38:17,560 --> 08:38:19,560
That's perfectly okay

7588
08:38:19,560 --> 08:38:21,560
perfectly, okay

7589
08:38:22,920 --> 08:38:24,920
Yeah

7590
08:38:25,800 --> 08:38:27,800
You are my oh

7591
08:38:28,440 --> 08:38:32,120
I don't know how I don't know how I

7592
08:38:33,080 --> 08:38:35,080
like just

7593
08:38:35,640 --> 08:38:39,400
The just being so inexperienced and like being so

7594
08:38:39,400 --> 08:38:41,400
Unknowing

7595
08:38:41,880 --> 08:38:47,400
And like you guys are just so overwhelmingly kind to me when you could have

7596
08:38:48,040 --> 08:38:53,000
Could have easily have taken the other avenue of being like

7597
08:38:53,800 --> 08:38:57,160
Oh, this this person hasn't done their research

7598
08:38:57,880 --> 08:39:02,920
Uh, they're just doing it for this reason that reason and instead you just showed me nothing

7599
08:39:03,000 --> 08:39:06,680
but like endless amounts of kindness of patience of like

7600
08:39:07,560 --> 08:39:14,040
Even excitement just to tell me what's what like literally like t s k r

7601
08:39:14,600 --> 08:39:16,600
And I say tisker

7602
08:39:16,680 --> 08:39:20,840
And it becomes like a meme instead of like someone could have easily have just been like

7603
08:39:21,400 --> 08:39:25,160
That's so pathetic. You don't know like the most common phrases

7604
08:39:25,960 --> 08:39:31,880
And like you you guys are just like so kind to be like yeah tisker. We love tisker

7605
08:39:32,040 --> 08:39:37,720
And it's just like such a a good freaking time

7606
08:39:38,760 --> 08:39:42,440
You know, you could have been cancelled for that for a lot

7607
08:39:43,880 --> 08:39:45,240
and

7608
08:39:45,240 --> 08:39:50,680
What if I can't choose between all of you I actually have

7609
08:39:51,880 --> 08:39:55,240
Solution if you can't choose and you're not gonna like it

7610
08:39:56,280 --> 08:39:58,760
And this is terrible of me to say out loud

7611
08:39:59,560 --> 08:40:02,440
But whoever caters to your

7612
08:40:05,560 --> 08:40:08,520
Your willy the most is who you should oh she

7613
08:40:09,400 --> 08:40:11,400
There's no other way to say it

7614
08:40:11,960 --> 08:40:18,280
But whoever caters the most is how you should oh she have your struggle and to pick between us

7615
08:40:22,680 --> 08:40:27,240
Um, yeah, because there's no other way to do it there isn't

7616
08:40:29,720 --> 08:40:32,360
Like come on, you know, I'm telling the truth

7617
08:40:33,400 --> 08:40:38,120
Don't let your brain do your thinking let your head do the thinking

7618
08:40:40,520 --> 08:40:42,520
Why think when your head can do the rest

7619
08:40:43,480 --> 08:40:45,480
Hey

7620
08:40:54,120 --> 08:40:59,480
Another we're at 9.4 k floren's every 20 minutes. Thank you

7621
08:41:01,560 --> 08:41:05,640
Uh, okay, we're getting really close to doing the outskirts fully a got this

7622
08:41:06,520 --> 08:41:12,520
Uh the lair of romulus. Um, I'll try and buy everything. Are you okay?

7623
08:41:13,720 --> 08:41:15,720
Are you okay? Do you need help?

7624
08:41:15,960 --> 08:41:22,840
Oh, she's being chinny. Oh, she's oh, she's calling me over. Yeah, you like the assassin style. Yeah

7625
08:41:24,040 --> 08:41:25,240
Oh

7626
08:41:25,240 --> 08:41:27,240
What's it? Oh

7627
08:41:27,240 --> 08:41:29,240
Oh, she's

7628
08:41:29,240 --> 08:41:32,760
Oh, she's okay. She's at the war. We'll leave it. I don't know what she's doing

7629
08:41:33,560 --> 08:41:40,760
It's really fun to like sit and watch NPCs in this game. Um, um, oh

7630
08:41:41,960 --> 08:41:43,320
Huh

7631
08:41:43,320 --> 08:41:45,560
I've just remembered another achievement

7632
08:41:46,520 --> 08:41:48,520
We'll need to do it where there's enemies

7633
08:41:49,800 --> 08:41:52,120
Because we can't do it here without enemies

7634
08:41:53,160 --> 08:41:55,640
Um, maybe I should get on a horse

7635
08:41:56,360 --> 08:41:59,320
Look at my horse. My horse is amazing

7636
08:41:59,880 --> 08:42:02,840
Yeah, I like oh, it just tastes like raisins

7637
08:42:04,440 --> 08:42:06,840
There's that hole. I can't remember

7638
08:42:09,560 --> 08:42:11,560
She's washing your feet

7639
08:42:12,840 --> 08:42:14,120
Oh

7640
08:42:14,120 --> 08:42:16,120
Honestly hashtag spoiled

7641
08:42:17,800 --> 08:42:22,440
What nice lady I didn't even tip her should I go back and tip her? No

7642
08:42:24,840 --> 08:42:26,840
Spain it's fine

7643
08:42:27,560 --> 08:42:28,760
Oh

7644
08:42:28,760 --> 08:42:31,720
polishing your shoes, whatever. Yeah my my uh

7645
08:42:32,760 --> 08:42:37,480
Ah, what's the name of the armored shoes if I go to the the the um

7646
08:42:38,760 --> 08:42:42,120
Blacksmith and keep going. It's not enough money

7647
08:42:44,360 --> 08:42:47,240
Oh my goodness I've blown through the veal or budget

7648
08:42:48,040 --> 08:42:50,040
Quick get me to the bank

7649
08:42:50,280 --> 08:42:52,280
Get me to the bank. Where's the bank?

7650
08:42:52,280 --> 08:42:54,280
Get me to the bank

7651
08:42:54,280 --> 08:42:56,280
Get me to the bank

7652
08:42:56,520 --> 08:43:00,600
Right mr. Banker. I have a really good idea. We take

7653
08:43:01,320 --> 08:43:02,920
Five girls

7654
08:43:02,920 --> 08:43:06,040
Okay with me and we do really cute streams

7655
08:43:06,600 --> 08:43:07,880
Okay

7656
08:43:07,880 --> 08:43:11,880
And we get to nerd about our games that we really like and we get to have a good time together

7657
08:43:12,280 --> 08:43:15,480
Are you in or out mr. Banker? How much will you invest?

7658
08:43:16,280 --> 08:43:18,680
Tell us how much is it gonna invest lads?

7659
08:43:18,680 --> 08:43:27,480
14 000 okay, I'll take it. I'll take it. He invested 14 000 better than none

7660
08:43:28,280 --> 08:43:30,840
Better than none. Right. Let's let's renovate the stable right now

7661
08:43:32,600 --> 08:43:36,360
I'm all in 50 trillion dollars

7662
08:43:38,280 --> 08:43:40,280
Let's bet everything

7663
08:43:42,840 --> 08:43:46,440
I quit years I quit or you're getting stabbed

7664
08:43:49,000 --> 08:43:51,480
In order to avoid this heinous act

7665
08:43:52,840 --> 08:43:58,120
Okay, um, we're getting close and maybe we won't do landmarks landmarks are

7666
08:43:59,080 --> 08:44:00,760
insanely expensive

7667
08:44:00,760 --> 08:44:02,760
We might maybe it's better to do these

7668
08:44:03,400 --> 08:44:12,520
See the landmarks all come together here like in between these like five is oh, yeah five is like 100 000 florins

7669
08:44:14,680 --> 08:44:17,080
Now don't get me wrong the banks make money but

7670
08:44:18,040 --> 08:44:20,040
nine

7671
08:44:20,600 --> 08:44:22,440
Nine squillion

7672
08:44:22,440 --> 08:44:26,360
Florin nine thousand squillion florins isn't gonna do it. You're gonna cut it

7673
08:44:27,080 --> 08:44:33,160
So we can't invest just take on them a blank check. Oh don't mind the bad

7674
08:44:37,480 --> 08:44:40,600
Uh, uh, you ready for this achievement?

7675
08:44:43,480 --> 08:44:45,480
Thank you very much

7676
08:44:45,640 --> 08:44:47,640
Ready

7677
08:44:47,720 --> 08:44:49,720
steady

7678
08:44:52,600 --> 08:44:54,600
Spring cleaning feet on with the broom

7679
08:44:55,880 --> 08:44:57,880
Can I parry with a broom?

7680
08:44:57,880 --> 08:44:58,920
Ah

7681
08:44:58,920 --> 08:45:00,600
pocket sand

7682
08:45:00,600 --> 08:45:03,800
You can parry with our broom. How does it not break?

7683
08:45:09,160 --> 08:45:13,720
Achievement name clean sweep. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah

7684
08:45:14,440 --> 08:45:23,240
That's what I'm talking about. What's that? You're too small enough to remember the secret achievements. Uh, yeah, what do you mean? You're not

7685
08:45:24,520 --> 08:45:26,520
Oh my god, you're not hashtag as

7686
08:45:27,480 --> 08:45:33,800
In love with this game. I'm just kidding. It's not a competition of who knows more about the video game

7687
08:45:33,880 --> 08:45:38,120
If you enjoy your video game, that's fantastic. We ain't here trying to give you a quiz

7688
08:45:38,760 --> 08:45:41,720
To prove that you've played the video game. That's not how it works out here

7689
08:45:42,680 --> 08:45:44,680
Not from around here

7690
08:45:47,800 --> 08:45:51,960
Oh, my assassin recruits gave me tons of money as well. I already forgot that part

7691
08:45:57,240 --> 08:45:59,720
Do your business with them and broom them fast

7692
08:46:05,320 --> 08:46:11,080
Is it possible to beat the whole game using a broom, uh, no because it won't spawn in all locations

7693
08:46:12,680 --> 08:46:18,040
Uh, you cannot do it in all locations. Take a little sip of water

7694
08:46:23,400 --> 08:46:24,680
Oh

7695
08:46:24,680 --> 08:46:29,240
Mercy going live in 10 minutes. Mercy going live in 10 minutes

7696
08:46:30,520 --> 08:46:32,680
Did mercy's fine name?

7697
08:46:35,640 --> 08:46:37,880
Mercy's fine name snippets

7698
08:46:38,440 --> 08:46:47,160
10 minute warning to all snippets. I repeat 10 minute warning for all snippets showtime is upon you

7699
08:46:52,760 --> 08:46:57,800
Uh, I always struggle to get out of the section of the game. You know what? I'm I'm gonna just jump down the hill

7700
08:46:58,120 --> 08:47:00,600
I'll just do it and I'll call the horse a bit later on

7701
08:47:01,240 --> 08:47:03,240
Hee hee

7702
08:47:04,200 --> 08:47:07,320
I really wet your whistle. I do need to wet my whistle

7703
08:47:08,200 --> 08:47:12,280
Did you know in Alice Madness Return the old lady says wet your whistle

7704
08:47:12,360 --> 08:47:17,320
And it used to scare me so much when I played that game. I used to be terrified of Alice Madness Return

7705
08:47:18,920 --> 08:47:22,040
You know, I'm starting to think I'm just a scaredy cat altogether. You know that

7706
08:47:23,320 --> 08:47:25,320
I think I'm just just a little scaredy cat

7707
08:47:27,480 --> 08:47:29,480
Right, let's just buy this

7708
08:47:29,480 --> 08:47:31,480
Oh

7709
08:47:33,320 --> 08:47:40,600
Wait, please give mercy my company allocated a mental well. Okay. Good night. Ha ha. No

7710
08:47:44,760 --> 08:47:50,040
No, not American McGee's Alice. I I tried to play it. I suck

7711
08:47:51,000 --> 08:47:54,520
And not the good kind. I just was not good at that game

7712
08:47:55,240 --> 08:47:59,400
I got stuck at the very start on the three-door portal thing

7713
08:47:59,800 --> 08:48:03,880
I don't know my game was bugging out or I was just too dumb, but I am very dumb

7714
08:48:03,960 --> 08:48:06,280
So that's the most plausible answer

7715
08:48:09,240 --> 08:48:14,440
Hi, Johnny. Oh wait, sorry. I just said hi. Johnny is if I was saying your name. Hi, babe

7716
08:48:16,280 --> 08:48:19,000
Congrats on doing it. Uh, congrats on you

7717
08:48:21,240 --> 08:48:23,240
How how you doing?

7718
08:48:25,240 --> 08:48:31,320
I can't believe I said that. Hi, Johnny. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Johnny's me

7719
08:48:34,520 --> 08:48:39,800
We're playing uh, thanks for saying congrats on doing it. Uh, thanks for watching us

7720
08:48:41,160 --> 08:48:45,960
Yumi plus was literally one of the only agents one of two agencies that responded

7721
08:48:46,920 --> 08:48:52,040
Uh, no, I tell a lie. There was a third agency, but due to taming it could not be possible

7722
08:48:52,440 --> 08:49:00,440
But um, there is very likely to be a third agency as well that we will interact with a lot because they were kind enough to give us the time of day

7723
08:49:01,240 --> 08:49:03,240
And I'm definitely a

7724
08:49:03,720 --> 08:49:07,480
Someone that's like if you scratch our back we'll scratch yours, you know

7725
08:49:07,880 --> 08:49:10,760
Like if you give me the time of day, I'll give you the time of day

7726
08:49:11,640 --> 08:49:15,400
Anyway, that's that's just my two cents. Anyway, that's just my two cents

7727
08:49:15,880 --> 08:49:27,480
I just said yumi plus like a dumbass you're being you

7728
08:49:28,760 --> 08:49:32,680
Sorry, there's a few girls from yumi plus that came in and I have been

7729
08:49:33,080 --> 08:49:37,640
Streaming for almost nine hours. So my brain is getting out there. But yes, thank you

7730
08:49:38,120 --> 08:49:43,080
It made again. I apologize from b and u not from yumi plus. I apologize

7731
08:49:43,880 --> 08:49:47,080
I'm I'm uh getting a bit h2 delirious

7732
08:49:47,800 --> 08:49:50,040
At the moment just because I love I've been playing

7733
08:49:51,000 --> 08:49:53,000
But me love me love

7734
08:49:54,040 --> 08:49:58,760
Prit me praying I say your name right? I like when my accent does it change? But no, I don't

7735
08:50:00,680 --> 08:50:02,680
Uh, I'm actually gonna

7736
08:50:04,440 --> 08:50:06,440
Don't want to hear

7737
08:50:07,640 --> 08:50:09,640
Aren't you supposed to be the one

7738
08:50:10,520 --> 08:50:12,760
Aren't you supposed to be the one with a mushy brain?

7739
08:50:13,320 --> 08:50:15,160
Yeah

7740
08:50:15,160 --> 08:50:18,920
Did you know my biggest weaknesses are mirrors?

7741
08:50:19,640 --> 08:50:23,000
And I can't wait to be close, but it's terrible, but it's true

7742
08:50:25,560 --> 08:50:29,560
Is it terrible to tell the truth? I don't know maybe

7743
08:50:30,920 --> 08:50:32,920
Maybe baby

7744
08:50:34,360 --> 08:50:36,360
If you tell them the truth

7745
08:50:36,920 --> 08:50:38,120
I

7746
08:50:38,120 --> 08:50:43,080
Was juggling three debut watch along the whole time. It's a wild ride. Wait, did other people debut on?

7747
08:50:43,800 --> 08:50:46,200
Or do you mean? Oh, do you mean their watch along? Yes?

7748
08:50:46,360 --> 08:50:50,760
You said the word watch along and then my brain completely went over that. That's exactly what you said

7749
08:50:50,840 --> 08:50:53,560
Yeah, that makes much more sense than what I was originally reading

7750
08:50:54,600 --> 08:50:56,600
Gee willikers. I'm losing the plot

7751
08:50:58,440 --> 08:51:02,280
Right, uh, we've kind we're gonna ignore these big buildings

7752
08:51:02,760 --> 08:51:06,280
Um, these cost a lot of money money. We do not have at the moment

7753
08:51:07,080 --> 08:51:10,200
Uh, all the funds went into developing the girls sorry tihi

7754
08:51:12,600 --> 08:51:16,600
We've arrived at seems great now want to see stormy looking in the mirror, which all that

7755
08:51:18,520 --> 08:51:20,760
Uh, someone suggested it and I'm like

7756
08:51:22,520 --> 08:51:26,680
Um, because like one of my like top 10 is like

7757
08:51:28,040 --> 08:51:30,040
Lost

7758
08:51:30,040 --> 08:51:35,000
Um, and I was like, it's literally perfect. It's like too perfect

7759
08:51:36,360 --> 08:51:41,640
Um, could you hit the size on yourself in a mirror only by accident like I wouldn't do it on purpose

7760
08:51:42,200 --> 08:51:44,200
It would be like an accident thing

7761
08:51:47,320 --> 08:51:53,160
I cannot wait to like do the donathon because I have so many panel like comic strip ideas

7762
08:51:53,880 --> 08:51:58,760
Um, if you've seen the one posted on twitter, um

7763
08:52:00,600 --> 08:52:07,400
Uh, that kind of panel comic stuff thing. I love it. I love it with my tongue out

7764
08:52:08,200 --> 08:52:09,800
of it

7765
08:52:09,800 --> 08:52:14,520
Cannot get enough of that like like one shot dojin type things

7766
08:52:15,960 --> 08:52:25,240
I just adore it right um, we're gonna do this viewpoint here. It's not too finicky now that we have the glove. It's not

7767
08:52:26,360 --> 08:52:29,080
Did I not just select that viewpoint?

7768
08:52:31,000 --> 08:52:34,040
I did select the viewpoint, but I guess I did it so fast

7769
08:52:35,000 --> 08:52:37,000
Um, but yeah

7770
08:52:37,480 --> 08:52:39,480
how would

7771
08:52:39,560 --> 08:52:42,440
Get out of him it just wears awful retain like my

7772
08:52:43,080 --> 08:52:46,920
Like my preference for like hypnosis is like it doesn't last forever

7773
08:52:47,240 --> 08:52:50,920
but I have recorded an audio that removes like any

7774
08:52:51,720 --> 08:52:53,240
um

7775
08:52:53,240 --> 08:52:58,680
Effects that I may have given you because I have gone the finger snapping route

7776
08:52:59,240 --> 08:53:02,680
Um, I quite like the finger snap in both ears

7777
08:53:03,240 --> 08:53:04,920
um

7778
08:53:04,920 --> 08:53:06,920
That's just me personally though

7779
08:53:07,400 --> 08:53:10,760
Um, and I also like the banyuril

7780
08:53:11,400 --> 08:53:15,560
repeated uh under for subliminal angle as well

7781
08:53:16,040 --> 08:53:19,960
So I've kind of like done that route, but that's just for me and uh,

7782
08:53:20,680 --> 08:53:23,640
You know, hopefully people enjoy it very new

7783
08:53:23,720 --> 08:53:29,720
But I just kind of did what I like because I find if I do what I like

7784
08:53:30,200 --> 08:53:32,700
Things come out very enjoyable

7785
08:53:33,960 --> 08:53:40,440
Uh overall whereas like if I kind of feel like forced it's like I doesn't really come out of the way I wanted it to come across

7786
08:53:40,520 --> 08:53:42,120
You know

7787
08:53:42,120 --> 08:53:44,120
This is just a viewpoint

7788
08:53:44,840 --> 08:53:47,400
Uh, aren't you going to condition as well?

7789
08:53:47,400 --> 08:53:52,520
That's why I've recorded an audio to undo it at any point. So if

7790
08:53:53,320 --> 08:53:55,880
You don't want to experience it anymore from me

7791
08:53:56,600 --> 08:54:03,720
Uh, you can definitely listen to it and undo all the thing because you got to be safe when you do hypnosis

7792
08:54:04,200 --> 08:54:06,200
I did my research

7793
08:54:06,680 --> 08:54:09,960
And definitely got to be safe got to make sure you're safe

7794
08:54:10,680 --> 08:54:14,600
And all that jazz so yeah, but uh, I don't really do anything

7795
08:54:15,560 --> 08:54:16,680
um

7796
08:54:16,680 --> 08:54:18,280
very

7797
08:54:18,280 --> 08:54:24,680
Out there um when it comes to the bit mnosis community a lot of things are

7798
08:54:25,480 --> 08:54:26,600
very

7799
08:54:26,600 --> 08:54:28,360
Like

7800
08:54:28,360 --> 08:54:30,360
In that and I'm not really

7801
08:54:30,360 --> 08:54:32,360
Going that route

7802
08:54:33,400 --> 08:54:38,360
Doesn't mean I'll I'll never say never never say never because I do like try in my hand and like everything

7803
08:54:38,440 --> 08:54:40,440
I'm kind of like a finger in the pies

7804
08:54:40,920 --> 08:54:45,160
Um, I just love kind of challenging myself like that newest audio

7805
08:54:45,640 --> 08:54:47,640
Uh, I have never really

7806
08:54:47,880 --> 08:54:53,560
Uh done anything to that degree before I was about to jump off there. Yeah, you won't hey bell. That's fine. Um

7807
08:54:54,760 --> 08:54:58,600
I have never done that kind of audio before

7808
08:54:59,320 --> 08:55:05,400
But I enjoyed doing it even though it's not like an interest of mine personally because it was a challenge

7809
08:55:05,480 --> 08:55:11,960
It was something I had to like go out there and learn about right. Okay. What aspects do people like about this particular thing?

7810
08:55:12,360 --> 08:55:14,280
Okay, I'm going to incorporate it this way

7811
08:55:14,280 --> 08:55:17,800
I've seen from like this video that I'm researching they did it this way

7812
08:55:17,880 --> 08:55:23,560
But I don't have a preference that way. I'd rather it be this way like I like that kind of challenge

7813
08:55:24,200 --> 08:55:26,600
um for me personally um

7814
08:55:27,800 --> 08:55:30,440
Which um, I like variety

7815
08:55:31,160 --> 08:55:36,840
Um, and all that good stuff. Sorry. I'm Emily. I'm kind of a bit passionate about that stuff too

7816
08:55:37,240 --> 08:55:39,240
But we can talk about it at a later time

7817
08:55:40,200 --> 08:55:42,200
I don't mind

7818
08:55:43,560 --> 08:55:45,560
Yeah

7819
08:55:46,600 --> 08:55:49,880
But yes, that's kind of my thing um, mercy

7820
08:55:51,640 --> 08:55:53,320
Snip it

7821
08:55:53,320 --> 08:55:55,320
Call out in three minutes

7822
08:55:55,800 --> 08:55:57,000
mods

7823
08:55:57,000 --> 08:56:04,360
You are given permission to link the stream once she goes live and then you're unpromissioned to talk. No, you're too quick

7824
08:56:05,080 --> 08:56:09,800
You're too quick once she goes live unless she's live. Is she live? She might be live

7825
08:56:11,080 --> 08:56:13,080
She's probably already alive

7826
08:56:13,080 --> 08:56:14,120
um

7827
08:56:14,120 --> 08:56:17,160
Okay, we're gonna do this section. This is actually quite a big section

7828
08:56:17,560 --> 08:56:19,560
Like you can see these contract missions

7829
08:56:19,800 --> 08:56:24,060
They go away as soon as you do them so we can 100% like do that, but we'll go for renovation

7830
08:56:27,640 --> 08:56:29,640
um

7831
08:56:29,800 --> 08:56:31,320
Yes

7832
08:56:31,320 --> 08:56:34,760
I am new for anyone who's like I can't wait to hear your stuff

7833
08:56:35,480 --> 08:56:38,120
Please give me the benefit of the doubt. It's like we kind of

7834
08:56:38,840 --> 08:56:41,160
You know get into it because

7835
08:56:42,520 --> 08:56:48,120
I'm new but I am passionate. I've actually always had a thing for it, but I've never

7836
08:56:49,560 --> 08:56:51,880
The problem is I needed to research it

7837
08:56:52,040 --> 08:56:55,080
But the rabbit hole gets so so deep

7838
08:56:55,560 --> 08:56:58,680
Like the first thing I learned was like the safety thing

7839
08:56:58,760 --> 08:57:03,960
Like I need to do an audio that reverts anything that I might have given someone

7840
08:57:04,680 --> 08:57:06,680
um

7841
08:57:07,400 --> 08:57:13,880
Like that was like the first major thing I learned and then the things were like the conditioning like what's your condition thing going to be

7842
08:57:14,360 --> 08:57:16,360
and I personally like

7843
08:57:16,360 --> 08:57:18,360
um

7844
08:57:18,520 --> 08:57:24,840
Double whispering is what I call it and snapping fingers and both ears like fine neural

7845
08:57:24,840 --> 08:57:28,280
It has to be by neural. It can't just be mono like in the center

7846
08:57:29,000 --> 08:57:32,360
Um, I like that. So I've incorporated that

7847
08:57:34,680 --> 08:57:36,680
It's almost 5 a.m. I should

7848
08:57:36,760 --> 08:57:40,040
Uh get back to the reason I'm pulling on all night our oopsies

7849
08:57:40,520 --> 08:57:44,120
Please rise well. Thank you for hanging. I apologize for taking on your sleep

7850
08:57:47,240 --> 08:57:51,160
Yeah, I like subliminal whispers as well that are by neural

7851
08:57:52,200 --> 08:57:58,680
Oh, I love it, but my goodness golly does it add to the overall like

7852
08:57:59,720 --> 08:58:02,680
Duration of how long it takes to make an audio, but that's fine

7853
08:58:03,160 --> 08:58:08,520
Like if it's a passion project type thing just a small sting and my enemies would fall

7854
08:58:08,920 --> 08:58:14,840
Okay, we've just unlocked poison darts, which are fantastic. I'm a bit late to the story considering

7855
08:58:15,800 --> 08:58:22,600
Uh, actually we need to poison five guards in order to do a mission for not mission

7856
08:58:24,440 --> 08:58:29,400
Uh, you can like oh, he saw me. He saw me. Oh man. He caught me. Oh

7857
08:58:30,280 --> 08:58:33,320
Can you stop my good? I really wish

7858
08:58:35,880 --> 08:58:38,280
Oh, fine. We're just gonna grab his weapon. Oh

7859
08:58:39,240 --> 08:58:43,320
Well, we can also do that. I guess jeez. Let me heal up

7860
08:58:45,800 --> 08:58:47,800
What was my awakening

7861
08:58:48,920 --> 08:58:53,000
The jungle book muggle the snake scene in the jungle book

7862
08:58:53,880 --> 08:58:56,040
Which is terrible, but it's

7863
08:58:58,920 --> 08:59:05,240
I was just kind of like oh wait, wait, wait. Why did I really like this like really like this?

7864
08:59:05,960 --> 08:59:07,960
I

7865
08:59:10,920 --> 08:59:12,920
Right did I get more poison

7866
08:59:15,400 --> 08:59:18,760
I'm listening to stream. Anyways, luckily I had to open another tab where we got taken down, but

7867
08:59:19,400 --> 08:59:24,680
Uh, this and I got asleep. Yeah, please rest. Well, don't worry. Uh, I'm benchy. I don't know my

7868
08:59:25,480 --> 08:59:29,960
My streams are very long. It's quite hard to stay up unless you like wake up at the same time as me

7869
08:59:29,960 --> 08:59:33,400
Go to sleep at the same time as me. It's a bit hard for my endurance streams

7870
08:59:33,400 --> 08:59:39,240
But I don't always do endurance streams like I've got needy streamer overload that way a short one the hand cam stream will be a short one

7871
08:59:40,680 --> 08:59:42,120
Um

7872
08:59:42,120 --> 08:59:45,800
How many hours is this I've probably got like one more hour

7873
08:59:46,760 --> 08:59:53,160
I'm just gonna try and buy all the buildings and then tomorrow we can tackle the layer

7874
08:59:53,640 --> 08:59:59,320
Of romulus and I can show you the armor, which I really like we'll get a big armor upgrade

7875
09:00:00,040 --> 09:00:02,040
Um

7876
09:00:03,320 --> 09:00:05,800
And leonardo missions and then

7877
09:00:06,840 --> 09:00:12,280
We try and hundred percent the game for the dna sequence, which I'm very nervous about because I've never done it before

7878
09:00:12,280 --> 09:00:18,120
And someone said the tank mission and I was like the tank mission and they were like, yeah the tank mission

7879
09:00:18,360 --> 09:00:20,360
And now I am scared of the tank mission

7880
09:00:21,720 --> 09:00:27,000
Because I don't know what the hundred percent is on it and I'm terrified

7881
09:00:27,240 --> 09:00:32,920
Uh, I think I'm gonna poison those guards, which sounds really mean

7882
09:00:33,880 --> 09:00:35,880
Yeah

7883
09:00:35,880 --> 09:00:38,280
So is it more about being in controllers at more of a

7884
09:00:39,000 --> 09:00:43,000
Thing I definitely go both ways with my interest in hypnosis

7885
09:00:43,720 --> 09:00:44,840
um

7886
09:00:44,840 --> 09:00:46,840
I do like the idea of being like

7887
09:00:47,400 --> 09:00:51,640
It backfires. I really enjoy the idea of it backfire. We're just gonna

7888
09:00:57,400 --> 09:00:59,400
No

7889
09:01:06,680 --> 09:01:11,480
Okay, we did it we poisoned all those guards. Oh, they're beating each other up. Oh

7890
09:01:14,200 --> 09:01:17,720
Oh, they jump in him hydration check

7891
09:01:20,280 --> 09:01:23,720
You really like mirrors, huh backfire. Yes

7892
09:01:24,360 --> 09:01:28,840
Um, so I like the concept that my like hypnosis that I'm supposed to do on you

7893
09:01:29,480 --> 09:01:34,120
Um, like backfires on me like if I look at a shiny object or reflective objects

7894
09:01:35,240 --> 09:01:37,240
Like I like that that's

7895
09:01:39,080 --> 09:01:43,320
But I do like the idea of being in control and like

7896
09:01:44,040 --> 09:01:47,480
Telling you what to do because like that kind of power is

7897
09:01:48,200 --> 09:01:51,320
Like insane that power feels like

7898
09:01:54,120 --> 09:01:58,920
I know that's not even like a word or anything, but like it just feels very like

7899
09:02:00,840 --> 09:02:02,840
Hot in here

7900
09:02:02,920 --> 09:02:05,080
Because it's like, what do you mean I'm in control of you?

7901
09:02:06,120 --> 09:02:08,120
I'm just an echo

7902
09:02:10,360 --> 09:02:13,640
Oh, how the turntables basically I enjoy that too. Yeah

7903
09:02:15,880 --> 09:02:17,080
In

7904
09:02:17,080 --> 09:02:21,880
But I definitely need to do like more research like secret subject has been fantastic

7905
09:02:22,360 --> 09:02:24,920
If you didn't know like secret subject like has done

7906
09:02:25,800 --> 09:02:27,800
uh, like reports

7907
09:02:28,200 --> 09:02:29,880
and

7908
09:02:29,880 --> 09:02:30,920
and

7909
09:02:30,920 --> 09:02:32,680
like essays

7910
09:02:32,680 --> 09:02:35,480
and just like explains like stuff on

7911
09:02:37,640 --> 09:02:40,200
Oh, I don't have enough money

7912
09:02:42,440 --> 09:02:44,440
I spent it all

7913
09:02:44,440 --> 09:02:49,960
Goodness gracious, right hydration system secret subject mentioned. Yeah, I love secret subject

7914
09:02:52,200 --> 09:02:54,200
Oh

7915
09:02:58,360 --> 09:03:00,360
Yeah, it's like she

7916
09:03:00,920 --> 09:03:03,800
Is just so oh, we made a living cave right where's a bank

7917
09:03:04,440 --> 09:03:10,840
Like she is just like doesn't gay keep like, um, she actually quote tweeted me on

7918
09:03:11,480 --> 09:03:13,880
Twitter which sent like a bunch of followers

7919
09:03:14,680 --> 09:03:18,760
Um, and she was like just so happy. There was another hypno beach of her and I'm like

7920
09:03:19,640 --> 09:03:21,640
I hope I don't disappoint her

7921
09:03:23,160 --> 09:03:24,600
Um

7922
09:03:24,600 --> 09:03:31,240
Just like I hope she's like oh like a secret subject has never given any indication of being like a mean person at all

7923
09:03:31,240 --> 09:03:33,960
and I would never ever think that um

7924
09:03:35,240 --> 09:03:42,520
I just hope like no one thinks like on the hypno side of things like I'm a poser like I'm just someone who genuinely does have an interest

7925
09:03:42,600 --> 09:03:44,600
I'm just not well versed

7926
09:03:45,080 --> 09:03:47,720
And like I'm at the learning stages of things

7927
09:03:48,440 --> 09:03:49,800
um

7928
09:03:49,800 --> 09:03:51,480
and like

7929
09:03:51,480 --> 09:03:55,080
Again, just like as long as you've got some patience for me

7930
09:03:55,640 --> 09:04:02,520
Uh, like every time I do something I'll gain more experience. I'll gain more understanding. I'll see the feedback back. Sorry

7931
09:04:03,160 --> 09:04:07,080
Um, and just overall have like a really it says down

7932
09:04:08,040 --> 09:04:10,040
The map says down

7933
09:04:11,320 --> 09:04:13,320
Pardon me, sorry

7934
09:04:13,480 --> 09:04:15,480
Um

7935
09:04:18,680 --> 09:04:23,480
No, I'm like so appreciative for like secret for just like not even being interested in

7936
09:04:24,280 --> 09:04:26,600
like gatekeeping isn't like a word but

7937
09:04:27,400 --> 09:04:34,840
Being so interested in what she does and being so passionate about what she does that she willingly shares and educates

7938
09:04:35,480 --> 09:04:37,480
Like it's just so nice

7939
09:04:37,480 --> 09:04:39,480
You know

7940
09:04:39,960 --> 09:04:41,960
Are

7941
09:04:42,520 --> 09:04:44,520
You going to once at this game? Oh

7942
09:04:45,640 --> 09:04:51,720
Uh, do we tell you that we already finished the campaign and we're now just doing renovations on the buildings on the map

7943
09:04:52,920 --> 09:04:56,440
We may have already finished the campaign

7944
09:04:57,240 --> 09:04:59,240
Hmm

7945
09:05:04,840 --> 09:05:10,520
Why do you care so much about what other men are doing? I don't understand what that means

7946
09:05:12,040 --> 09:05:14,520
Sorry, you're gonna have to rephrase that I don't understand

7947
09:05:19,480 --> 09:05:21,480
That was way too fast. Oh, yeah

7948
09:05:23,080 --> 09:05:25,080
You finished it like an hour ago

7949
09:05:25,160 --> 09:05:29,000
Yeah, I'm just trying to buy everything like renovation wise

7950
09:05:29,720 --> 09:05:30,840
and

7951
09:05:30,840 --> 09:05:32,680
then

7952
09:05:32,680 --> 09:05:34,840
line

7953
09:05:34,840 --> 09:05:36,440

Uh, do the romuli and all that you're mister earlier message. Wait, what sorry, sorry

7955
09:05:43,800 --> 09:05:45,560
What did I mean?

7956
09:05:45,560 --> 09:05:50,520
I'm actually literally landlord simulator right now. Like this city owns me so much money

7957
09:05:51,080 --> 09:05:58,280
Oh, mercy's definitely up by now. If you're a snippet or want to give mercy modest also known as

7958
09:05:58,840 --> 09:06:01,720
Slava thought if she was slavic and that's absolutely

7959
09:06:02,520 --> 09:06:04,520
outrageous name

7960
09:06:06,520 --> 09:06:10,680
Racial emotivated name unironically that's absolutely atrocious. Um

7961
09:06:11,720 --> 09:06:17,240
Then she is live and she is playing killer seven if my memory serves me correct

7962
09:06:17,640 --> 09:06:22,680
So, please do check out mercy. Uh, right now. We're literally just rambling and renovating

7963
09:06:23,480 --> 09:06:28,440
We have passed the campaign stage, which means my ankles for one

7964
09:06:29,640 --> 09:06:31,160
We are

7965
09:06:31,160 --> 09:06:36,120
Mocking about at this stage if you're here for progression progression commences tomorrow

Right now we renovating and getting rich baby. We're playing rich simulator. We probably should have done that pigeon thing. That's fine

7967
09:06:43,800 --> 09:06:45,800
I

7968
09:06:46,360 --> 09:06:48,360
Don't do that

7969
09:06:48,840 --> 09:06:53,480
Yapping inland lord and honestly by nightfall she will own the city

7970
09:06:55,160 --> 09:06:57,800
Have you heard of sav lit? I haven't no

Mercy is live. I'll repeat again. Mercy is live. You can find her link in the description

7982
09:07:58,680 --> 09:08:02,680
Or I can give permission to a youtube mod to post the link

7983
09:08:03,320 --> 09:08:05,320
He

7984
09:08:06,920 --> 09:08:12,360
Right, uh, if you do doctor and then go nor then yeah

7985
09:08:13,800 --> 09:08:18,680
Look at him. He's so mad at me because he dropped his box and it disappeared into nothing

7986
09:08:24,360 --> 09:08:30,760
There's the doctor over here doctor doctor I miss it. What was that song 10?

7987
09:08:32,680 --> 09:08:36,520
Five monkeys jumping on a bed one fell off and bumped their head

7988
09:08:37,080 --> 09:08:41,800
Wait, is there doctor mentioned first came love? No, right. My brain is just crossing everything right now

7989
09:08:43,560 --> 09:08:50,440
Is that the same tune? Okay. Yes, I signed the first came love second come marriage third comes baby in the golden carriage

7990
09:08:52,600 --> 09:08:55,560
Okay, empty faction building and coming for you

7991
09:08:56,680 --> 09:08:59,480
Oh 13 out of 15 medical shops

7992
09:09:00,360 --> 09:09:02,840
Renovated we getting close

7993
09:09:03,560 --> 09:09:09,000
Um, I I'm actually going to send my recruits away again because they're the money makers and

7994
09:09:09,960 --> 09:09:12,200
The money pile is getting smaller and smaller

7995
09:09:13,880 --> 09:09:15,880
Haram beat was

7996
09:09:16,520 --> 09:09:18,760
I know I wasn't Haram. It was Karam

7997
09:09:19,560 --> 09:09:21,560
I think I don't know I'm Karam's

7998
09:09:21,960 --> 09:09:23,960
Karam nice and easy to

7999
09:09:24,200 --> 09:09:26,200
Money money money

8000
09:09:26,600 --> 09:09:28,600
It must be funny

8001
09:09:29,000 --> 09:09:31,000
In a rich man's world

8002
09:09:32,760 --> 09:09:34,760
Oh

8003
09:09:37,720 --> 09:09:43,160
All the things I could do if I had a wee bit money

8004
09:09:44,200 --> 09:09:46,200
Must be funny

8005
09:09:46,920 --> 09:09:48,600
A little bit delirious

8006
09:09:48,600 --> 09:09:49,800
That's okay

8007
09:09:49,800 --> 09:09:52,520
Uh, right what we're doing four. Let's do four

8008
09:09:53,480 --> 09:09:57,560
You level up you guys because you guys are pretty weak sauce

8009
09:09:59,560 --> 09:10:03,000
A hundred xp is not good

8010
09:10:05,400 --> 09:10:07,400
For you

8011
09:10:10,280 --> 09:10:12,280
Right I like those odds

8012
09:10:15,240 --> 09:10:17,240
How did this turn into

8013
09:10:17,400 --> 09:10:19,400
Vantian business taken?

8014
09:10:19,800 --> 09:10:22,280
It's literally just like a side part of the game

8015
09:10:23,160 --> 09:10:27,800
Um, I just kind of like comes out and over honestly, uh, like send them all off

8016
09:10:28,600 --> 09:10:31,560
Money money money money money money money money

8017
09:10:46,600 --> 09:10:48,600
Okay, well just do that

8018
09:10:49,400 --> 09:10:55,480
For them. They're unfortunately a bit too weak. I'm just gonna safely send them all together

8019
09:10:55,480 --> 09:10:59,080
I don't want anyone to perish at this stage because everyone's getting pretty leveled up at this point

8020
09:10:59,640 --> 09:11:05,000
And uh, okay. I've got 12k for doing that. That's fantastic. Uh, right. Okay. We're gonna renovate this

8021
09:11:05,080 --> 09:11:12,360
We're gonna look at this view point. There's 24 view points in brotherhood and the borja tower's total

8022
09:11:12,600 --> 09:11:14,600
I believe is

8023
09:11:18,200 --> 09:11:20,200
10 no 12

8024
09:11:21,560 --> 09:11:23,960
Maybe 12 maybe 11

8025
09:11:24,920 --> 09:11:28,200
Mmm, so already 11 view points have been

8026
09:11:29,960 --> 09:11:31,960
Uh dealt with

8027
09:11:32,600 --> 09:11:34,600
Is this where I'm supposed to go?

8028
09:11:34,600 --> 09:11:38,680
Hello. Hello. Can I purchase you? I would like one courtesan tree

8029
09:11:40,600 --> 09:11:45,480
I do have the stamina to still be playing I love my video games and I love yapping

8030
09:11:46,600 --> 09:11:48,600
So I may or may not

8031
09:11:48,760 --> 09:11:50,760
Still be here

8032
09:11:51,160 --> 09:11:56,680
Um, I think I'll try and buy everything on the map and then once I've done that and

8033
09:11:57,640 --> 09:11:59,960
I think we'll retire for the evening

8034
09:12:01,080 --> 09:12:03,080
possibly

8035
09:12:03,880 --> 09:12:07,160
Or do we just go for it and send it? I don't know. How are we at?

8036
09:12:08,120 --> 09:12:13,960
We're at nine hours. So we technically have three hours before the vod starts

8037
09:12:15,080 --> 09:12:18,040
And feeling a bit special

8038
09:12:19,000 --> 09:12:24,840
So, I mean maybe my first game stream could be 12 hours

8039
09:12:27,080 --> 09:12:30,120
Hmm me honestly

8040
09:12:32,200 --> 09:12:35,000
Honestly for I'm feeling all right right now

8041
09:12:35,800 --> 09:12:40,280
Like I'm feeling out where the heck am I supposed to go? Am I supposed to do this thing? No, I'm not. Is that building?

8042
09:12:41,560 --> 09:12:43,560
um

8043
09:12:43,560 --> 09:12:48,200
Absolutely legendary feat. Oh, yeah, like I just love the game

8044
09:12:48,520 --> 09:12:50,520
Uh, obviously

8045
09:12:50,520 --> 09:12:57,320
The company of the reeflings make it absolutely fantastic being able to just blab about this game and

8046
09:12:57,960 --> 09:13:02,840
Ramble away about anything and everything. What the heck am I supposed to be doing here? I supposed to jump on the

8047
09:13:03,320 --> 09:13:06,440
That can be right up like this. No

8048
09:13:07,400 --> 09:13:09,400
Must be that one then

8049
09:13:10,440 --> 09:13:12,280
um

8050
09:13:12,280 --> 09:13:15,320
Okay, yeah, there we go. Um like

8051
09:13:17,320 --> 09:13:20,120
No, I won't say that that's not nice. That's not kind

8052
09:13:21,640 --> 09:13:24,120
Um 12 hours that's impressed. Yeah

8053
09:13:24,760 --> 09:13:29,400
Please understand if I hate the game I'm spending 12 hours on it

8054
09:13:30,760 --> 09:13:35,400
The fact that I have much stamina right now is because I absolutely adore this game

8055
09:13:35,720 --> 09:13:38,120
And I'm so glad I like get to share it with you

8056
09:13:38,680 --> 09:13:41,160
And just like show you everything about it like right now

8057
09:13:41,160 --> 09:13:46,840
We're playing landlord simulator on it you can do this as you progress through the campaign mode

8058
09:13:46,920 --> 09:13:50,760
But obviously we we finished the campaign mode. So never just don't landlord them

8059
09:13:51,400 --> 09:13:53,400
uh

8060
09:13:54,920 --> 09:13:56,920
Um, I don't know

8061
09:13:57,640 --> 09:14:01,480
If I maybe I could order some food

8062
09:14:03,240 --> 09:14:05,240
And then we take a break and I eat it

8063
09:14:05,720 --> 09:14:07,720
uh

8064
09:14:08,200 --> 09:14:09,320
Yeah

8065
09:14:09,320 --> 09:14:12,360
You got to do what you love reeflings Johnny loves brother

8066
09:14:13,160 --> 09:14:18,920
Oh, no if any of yousers stay enough. I'm so sorry. Yeah more content for eu frogs to just woke up

8067
09:14:19,320 --> 09:14:24,520
That is hilarious because someone was like are you gonna stream earlier to be eu friendly?

8068
09:14:25,160 --> 09:14:28,280
Um, and it's like well dependent on the game

8069
09:14:28,760 --> 09:14:31,800
I might be online when you wake up

8070
09:14:32,360 --> 09:14:38,920
Uh, so yeah, hi. Good morning. He you. How you doing?

8071
09:14:41,480 --> 09:14:46,360
Um, I wish youtube would fix the 12 hour

8072
09:14:47,400 --> 09:14:49,400
streaming vod issue

8073
09:14:50,600 --> 09:14:51,720
Um

8074
09:14:51,720 --> 09:14:57,480
If they did I honestly think I could do 14 hour streams like literally wake up

8075
09:14:58,120 --> 09:15:04,920
Very quickly, you know toilet brush teeth get some food ready. I think I could genuinely do that

8076
09:15:05,880 --> 09:15:08,680
Obviously my voice is croaking like a frog, but

8077
09:15:09,800 --> 09:15:17,240
I don't want to stop like I'm having a good time. I don't want a fun time for pause champ. That sounds bad for your health. I mean

8078
09:15:19,240 --> 09:15:24,440
I'm gonna say something controversial. I hope it doesn't come across like that, but for me

8079
09:15:25,400 --> 09:15:29,560
To talk and play video games. I don't

8080
09:15:30,600 --> 09:15:35,720
Feel I am over exerting myself as long as I have no current

8081
09:15:36,360 --> 09:15:40,760
issues going on such as illness dehydration possibly

8082
09:15:41,560 --> 09:15:43,560
um

8083
09:15:43,800 --> 09:15:45,320
Or

8084
09:15:45,320 --> 09:15:51,800
Other elements such as this that may prevent long-term streaming, but I am quite a happy bun

8085
09:15:52,760 --> 09:15:54,760
My blood flow is good. My heart

8086
09:15:55,640 --> 09:15:57,080
Is good to go

8087
09:15:57,080 --> 09:15:58,120
um

8088
09:15:58,120 --> 09:16:03,000
You know, I understand that some people may find it negative for their health to maybe

8089
09:16:04,360 --> 09:16:08,120
Not like sit and play games for 12 hours, but me

8090
09:16:09,080 --> 09:16:14,680
Of kinder I kind of done it for a long time like when I was um

8091
09:16:16,040 --> 09:16:18,040
When I was younger I

8092
09:16:18,360 --> 09:16:23,640
Had a rough time at high school. You know how it goes yawn yawn

8093
09:16:24,440 --> 09:16:30,680
um, and I very comfortably played xbox all day long. Um,

8094
09:16:31,320 --> 09:16:34,360
my parents were very understanding about my

8095
09:16:35,240 --> 09:16:40,280
situation as best as they could when it came to high school and um

8096
09:16:41,000 --> 09:16:45,160
Kind of not fitting in so I had a lot of days just to myself

8097
09:16:45,960 --> 09:16:47,960
Left of my own devices and

8098
09:16:48,840 --> 09:16:55,080
I used to just play xbox all day long and uh, yes, I'm very lucky to have the parents that I do

8099
09:16:55,720 --> 09:16:57,160
and

8100
09:16:57,160 --> 09:16:59,160
like I

8101
09:16:59,160 --> 09:17:06,360
hear stories of parents that don't quite understand like maybe what anxiety is or what

8102
09:17:07,080 --> 09:17:09,080
agoraphobia is or

8103
09:17:09,720 --> 09:17:11,240
kind of

8104
09:17:11,240 --> 09:17:13,240
these elements that may

8105
09:17:14,200 --> 09:17:17,160
Make up parts of your being and

8106
09:17:18,200 --> 09:17:20,200
kind of to have a parent who

8107
09:17:21,080 --> 09:17:25,400
Who loves you who loves you and but just unable to comprehend

8108
09:17:25,960 --> 09:17:32,200
How you are in the moment. It's rough and I do genuinely feel for you if you're in that situation

8109
09:17:32,760 --> 09:17:38,840
I hope that you feel comforted in the fact that like here you're accepted

8110
09:17:38,920 --> 09:17:41,400
You can be as autistic as you like, okay

8111
09:17:42,360 --> 09:17:43,800
and

8112
09:17:43,800 --> 09:17:45,800
you can

8113
09:17:45,800 --> 09:17:51,000
Just be yourself. I know you might worry about messages and oh my goodness. What does she think but

8114
09:17:52,520 --> 09:17:58,600
She thinks like herself, you know, I was in your shoes once most likely where

8115
09:17:59,560 --> 09:18:06,600
I was terrified of the world. I was terrified to leave my room. My life was in my room

8116
09:18:07,480 --> 09:18:14,120
Uh, and I was in my head and it's terrible when you're in your head. I wish I could pull you out instantly

8117
09:18:14,280 --> 09:18:16,280
I wish I could pull you out overnight

8118
09:18:16,520 --> 09:18:20,280
But guess what if watching my stream slowly pulls you out?

8119
09:18:21,080 --> 09:18:23,080
goodness gravy

8120
09:18:23,560 --> 09:18:26,040
Goodness gravy. Um, I am so

8121
09:18:26,760 --> 09:18:30,120
Lucky to be the one that can show you

8122
09:18:30,920 --> 09:18:36,040
That yes, the world is a scary place and guess what if your therapy is

8123
09:18:36,760 --> 09:18:38,760
some random scots

8124
09:18:39,400 --> 09:18:43,640
Playing the sassan's green brotherhood and nerdy now and then occasionally

8125
09:18:44,120 --> 09:18:46,120
It's throwing out a joke here and there

8126
09:18:47,320 --> 09:18:49,880
Let's get it. Let's get to it. You know

8127
09:18:51,160 --> 09:18:53,960
The world is our oyster. Okay

8128
09:18:56,360 --> 09:18:57,960
Like don't

8129
09:18:57,960 --> 09:18:59,560
Take your time

8130
09:18:59,560 --> 09:19:00,920
life

8131
09:19:00,920 --> 09:19:05,640
As they say Rome wasn't built in a day get it because we're in Rome. Huh, huh, huh?

8132
09:19:06,440 --> 09:19:12,280
And you know, you're not gonna figure out life in a day. Don't be silly. You're not gonna figure out in a week

8133
09:19:12,280 --> 09:19:14,840
You're not gonna figure it out in a month. You're not gonna figure it out

8134
09:19:15,640 --> 09:19:22,760
Until maybe you're even on the other side of it because how do you get life exp by living life?

8135
09:19:23,720 --> 09:19:25,720
okay

8136
09:19:26,920 --> 09:19:28,520
and

8137
09:19:28,520 --> 09:19:34,280
I think if you might be someone who struggles to go outside maybe at the moment or

8138
09:19:34,840 --> 09:19:36,840
with other areas

8139
09:19:37,000 --> 09:19:39,160
If you want to see it like a video game

8140
09:19:39,160 --> 09:19:41,800
It is the best way I could ever explain it

8141
09:19:42,360 --> 09:19:46,040
Is that you're always gaining exp every day. You might say to yourself

8142
09:19:46,600 --> 09:19:52,120
You know what? I'm just rotten in bed. I'm just watching streamers. I'm doing nothing. I'm not progressing

8143
09:19:53,400 --> 09:19:58,360
What if I told you that even though vtuber's may be entertainers

8144
09:19:59,000 --> 09:20:01,800
They can still teach you a thing or two about life like

8145
09:20:02,600 --> 09:20:08,600
Communicating with people or listening to people communicate and hearing their opinions

8146
09:20:09,000 --> 09:20:13,240
Giving you a new perspective on things you might never have considered before

8147
09:20:13,800 --> 09:20:19,240
Like please don't ever think you genuinely are stagnant and rotting

8148
09:20:19,560 --> 09:20:24,120
I know the terminology is rotten in bed and I've rotted all day. I've not done anything. I've did it

8149
09:20:24,120 --> 09:20:25,160
I did it

8150
09:20:25,160 --> 09:20:27,560
Well, I was told you you don't have to do anything

8151
09:20:28,120 --> 09:20:30,440
Who said you had to do anything like

8152
09:20:31,160 --> 09:20:33,160
Just

8153
09:20:33,400 --> 09:20:40,360
One breath at a time one day at a time you have come so far and you have

8154
09:20:41,640 --> 09:20:43,640
genuinely

8155
09:20:43,800 --> 09:20:48,680
Um, like gone through every worst day of your life and you're still here

8156
09:20:49,080 --> 09:20:54,840
You have no concept of how strong you are and like I'm like tearing up thinking about you. Oh my god

8157
09:20:55,800 --> 09:20:57,560
Like um

8158
09:20:57,560 --> 09:21:00,680
I'm happy to like share this like thing of the past, but

8159
09:21:01,320 --> 09:21:03,400
I was having a rough day. Um

8160
09:21:04,360 --> 09:21:07,400
And we listened to a song by mr. Kitty

8161
09:21:08,040 --> 09:21:15,000
And I said the phrase you feel like this all the time and like oh i'm actually crying

8162
09:21:15,640 --> 09:21:20,120
I don't want you guys to feel like that. Oh my proper crying. Hold on

8163
09:21:20,920 --> 09:21:23,640
Oh, I need breathe. Hold on. I'm just being dramatic. Okay

8164
09:21:24,360 --> 09:21:28,120
But like I don't like want you guys to feel like that like it's so

8165
09:21:28,760 --> 09:21:31,640
like it just makes me feel so sad because

8166
09:21:33,080 --> 09:21:37,000
Like I know how sad I used to feel and like

8167
09:21:38,520 --> 09:21:43,880
Oh, I just don't want you to feel it. Right. I need to stop crying. I'm like, I'm literally such a baby

8168
09:21:45,320 --> 09:21:47,320
No cry. No cry

8169
09:21:47,640 --> 09:21:52,200
No cry literally happy tears like

8170
09:21:52,840 --> 09:21:58,040
Oh, I think like there's just so many emotions like especially with like recently

8171
09:21:58,840 --> 09:22:01,240
Like debut and like all these girls are

8172
09:22:01,880 --> 09:22:06,760
Just like so fantastic and they all had faith in me and you guys all had faith in me

8173
09:22:07,400 --> 09:22:12,760
But like it took so long to get here and there was like so much blood sweat and tears and it was like

8174
09:22:13,640 --> 09:22:21,960
But I did it like I did it. I got past all those bad days and you've got past all those bad days like that's a fact and

8175
09:22:23,640 --> 09:22:27,000
You know, I always say the phrase if life was easy

8176
09:22:27,560 --> 09:22:33,240
Then how would the good times be so good if you wouldn't appreciate the good times, you know

8177
09:22:34,120 --> 09:22:36,680
And like some people say the phrase like

8178
09:22:37,400 --> 09:22:39,400
I've got any money

8179
09:22:39,880 --> 09:22:44,440
Um, some people like say the the phrase um

8180
09:22:46,600 --> 09:22:48,600
Like

8181
09:22:49,240 --> 09:22:52,760
I've completely forgotten where I am because that stupid bank interaction

8182
09:22:53,640 --> 09:22:55,640
um

8183
09:22:57,080 --> 09:22:59,080
I've forgotten what I'm saying

8184
09:22:59,640 --> 09:23:03,480
Maybe I should forget because I don't want to like cry. I don't want to make you guys like upset or anything

8185
09:23:03,880 --> 09:23:05,880
I just like wasn't a happy times

8186
09:23:06,280 --> 09:23:08,840
Good times coming and hopefully like

8187
09:23:09,480 --> 09:23:16,440
This is the start of the good times coming. Um, like you don't need to worry about me being like an endurance streamer or anything like that, you know

8212
09:24:58,280 --> 09:25:00,280
You fucking did it

8213
09:25:01,000 --> 09:25:05,800
And literally like oh, I'm gonna start crying again, but you're so fucking strong

8214
09:25:05,960 --> 09:25:10,760
Don't think of your like don't ever think of yourself like oh, I'm weak. No motherfucker

8215
09:25:11,560 --> 09:25:13,560
You're a rifling

8216
09:25:14,920 --> 09:25:18,280
Well, maybe even if you're not rifling while you're listening to this that's fine

8217
09:25:18,680 --> 09:25:23,960
But you are very strong and you don't know it. You don't know it because you know

8218
09:25:25,000 --> 09:25:29,800
If you haven't been presented with that idea or the concept that strength isn't in physical

8219
09:25:30,520 --> 09:25:34,760
Uh, like brute, uh, not brutish ability, but physical physical strength

8220
09:25:35,560 --> 09:25:41,560
Then how are you gonna know that you're like this strong until you've been told that you don't know any better until someone goes

8221
09:25:42,120 --> 09:25:43,880
Hey, numb nuts

8222
09:25:43,880 --> 09:25:47,880
Wake up my goodness. Look at everything you've achieved. Look how far you've come

8223
09:25:47,960 --> 09:25:53,080
Like how many days can you remember where you were like my goodness? I just want to give up

8224
09:25:53,160 --> 09:25:56,120
I don't want to get up out in bed anymore. I don't want to do this

8225
09:25:56,680 --> 09:25:58,680
And yet here you are

8226
09:25:59,560 --> 09:26:01,560

8227
09:26:01,560 --> 09:26:03,320

My god, what a blessing what a life like I don't believe in religion

8230
09:26:14,440 --> 09:26:15,960

09:26:21,160 --> 09:26:24,920
I'm so sorry. I didn't mean it to come across like that

8233
09:26:25,560 --> 09:26:27,240

8234
09:26:27,240 --> 09:26:33,160

09:26:40,120 --> 09:26:47,560
When talos is a god in skyrim before anyone thinks i'm disinonia nah talos is from skyrim

8238
09:26:48,040 --> 09:26:49,560

Nordic people um, oh that sounded weird when I said that didn't mean it like that but yeah

8242
09:27:02,280 --> 09:27:07,240
I still have days like that, but knowing how strong I am is like knowing the sun will come back. Yes

8243
09:27:08,120 --> 09:27:13,640
Just because the sun is hiding behind the clouds right now

8244
09:27:14,680 --> 09:27:19,560
Doesn't mean you will never feel the warmth of it on your face ever again

8245
09:27:20,280 --> 09:27:22,280
The sun will hug you

8246
09:27:22,920 --> 09:27:26,200
The sun will embrace you like the six

8247
09:27:27,240 --> 09:27:31,160
Um even on the cloudiest of days the sun is always

8248
09:27:31,880 --> 09:27:36,680
Shaming even if you can't see it or feel it's warm. This is true

8249
09:27:37,880 --> 09:27:41,000
Hey, these are facts. Yes, but straight facts

8250
09:27:43,240 --> 09:27:46,760
You need to make a motivational speech and we'll all jump before asking

8251
09:27:47,640 --> 09:27:49,080
Hi

09:27:49,080 --> 09:27:54,760
Oh, that's so cute. Can you just feel the sun? Oh, are you are you ready for this?

8253
09:27:57,800 --> 09:27:59,800
Speaking of the sun

8254
09:28:01,800 --> 09:28:03,800
Oh wait, hold on. I've done it wrong

8255
09:28:07,960 --> 09:28:09,960
Mm-hmm

8256
09:28:10,360 --> 09:28:12,360
It's a bit wonky

8257
09:28:24,120 --> 09:28:31,320
So please don't take my refling away, but if you're not a refill and that's fine

8258
09:28:32,040 --> 09:28:34,040
I

09:28:35,480 --> 09:28:41,400
Have a music box that does you are my sunshine. Did I not send away those recruits?

8260
09:28:47,400 --> 09:28:48,920

8268
09:29:22,680 --> 09:29:24,680

Yeah, play sunshine on a ukulele

8270

09:29:59,720 --> 09:30:02,040
Oracle of the view flings lego

My shells shame. Yes. My shells are reflect. They like move about they're like parallelism

8276
09:30:12,680 --> 09:30:17,960
I think you should burp if you want to make us forget the crying and wholesome speech. Uh, I would need to call it for that

8277
09:30:18,200 --> 09:30:19,400
But

8278
09:30:19,400 --> 09:30:23,640
How much money have I got we need to invest in the black?

8279
09:30:24,040 --> 09:30:30,120
No, we need to invest in the bank because the bank might have investment money in it

8280
09:30:31,960 --> 09:30:33,960
Give a burp any burpers

8281
09:30:34,840 --> 09:30:36,840
You know, I didn't think Vsucky would be in most here

8282
09:30:38,680 --> 09:30:40,680
Okay, you're done

8283
09:30:41,560 --> 09:30:43,560
Look

8284
09:30:43,800 --> 09:30:49,160
At least some of you could appreciate the naming angle I went with because there was like the

8285
09:30:50,200 --> 09:30:52,520
Because there was succubus blood running around

8286
09:30:53,240 --> 09:30:55,080
Okay

8287
09:30:55,080 --> 09:30:58,600
So at least some of you saw the vision. Okay

09:31:03,480 --> 09:31:07,000
Oh, we made 13k we can definitely invest that money

8289
09:31:11,160 --> 09:31:13,160

What's MGE you must tell me and I will tell you what I know

Has been renovated. We're getting there. We're getting there. I think there was a blacksmith up the staircase somewhere

09:31:59,640 --> 09:32:04,200
A little bit further away, but yeah, that's fine got horses in that dinner

8302
09:32:08,200 --> 09:32:10,920
The monster girl encyclopedia it depends

To what degree you mean. Do you mean like I know what a slime girl is or this type of girl is then yes most likely

8304
09:32:20,440 --> 09:32:25,960
But if you want me to get like super specific and be like did you did you did it? No

8305
09:32:29,560 --> 09:32:35,000
Um why are you wanting a gen 2 to be someone out of that if you say slime girl

8306
09:32:38,840 --> 09:32:44,600
As much as slime girl is beautiful in nature and in design

8307
09:32:46,920 --> 09:32:48,920
For a vichy bar

8308
09:32:51,480 --> 09:32:53,480
It does not make

8309
09:32:55,480 --> 09:32:58,680
It does not make me sprung um

8310
09:33:00,680 --> 09:33:02,680
Which is terrible

8311
09:33:02,920 --> 09:33:09,560
Oh the series. Oh, no, I don't know the series of monster girl. No, no, sorry. I misunderstood the

8312
09:33:11,320 --> 09:33:17,160
The uh explanation. No, I do not know monster girl series. I apologize

8313
09:33:17,800 --> 09:33:21,720
I went to sleep and you were streaming and I woke up and you're still streaming. Hell yeah

8314
09:33:22,520 --> 09:33:25,720
Uh, we're actually gonna do 12 hours. So t minus

8315
09:33:26,520 --> 09:33:29,240
Two and a half hours. Uh mersey modest

8316
09:33:29,960 --> 09:33:35,800
My gen mate is live right now on killer seven. Please do not hesitate to check her out

8317
09:33:36,440 --> 09:33:40,600
I am an endurance streamer. So I am going to be online for a very long time

8318
09:33:41,160 --> 09:33:46,520
We have officially finished the campaign section of assassin's creed brotherhood

8319
09:33:46,840 --> 09:33:54,840
We are currently going around renovating all buildings that we can at the moment and then we are likely to either do

8320
09:33:55,800 --> 09:33:57,800
The layer of Romulus

8321
09:33:58,360 --> 09:34:03,160
First due to its easy nature in comparison to Leonardo's

8322
09:34:03,880 --> 09:34:09,000
Missions, we are not going to do Leonardo's. I think we might run out of time for Leonardo's mission

8323
09:34:10,520 --> 09:34:14,040
I want to say I think we will run out of time. Um

8324
09:34:15,960 --> 09:34:17,720
I will

8325
09:34:17,720 --> 09:34:21,560
Uh go for as long as I can though. Uh, I might call a water

8326
09:34:22,200 --> 09:34:29,160
Cola pee pee break and I am going to order some delivery food. Um, I'm not sure what I should order though

8327
09:34:31,000 --> 09:34:37,400
I want to say right. Okay. So I've had mcdonald's in america and I've had mcdonald's in scotland

8328
09:34:37,560 --> 09:34:39,560
I've had mcdonald's in australia

8329
09:34:40,040 --> 09:34:44,200
Do you want to know which country's mcdonald's makes my ass blow out?

8330
09:34:46,840 --> 09:34:48,680
Australia

8331
09:34:48,680 --> 09:34:50,680
Not america

8332
09:34:51,000 --> 09:34:54,280
I don't know what is with australian mcdonald's

8333
09:34:55,000 --> 09:34:56,360
um

8334
09:34:56,360 --> 09:35:00,120
But for some reason it destroys

8335
09:35:01,000 --> 09:35:02,120
my

8336
09:35:02,120 --> 09:35:04,120
intestines

8337
09:35:04,920 --> 09:35:06,920
They genuinely cannot handle

8338
09:35:08,280 --> 09:35:12,760
A maca's. I don't know if it's because they don't change the oil maybe. Um

8339
09:35:14,120 --> 09:35:19,080
Not beating the change of the oil accusations, but it's very plausible because yeah

8340
09:35:21,000 --> 09:35:26,760
Hungry jack possibly I've never had a problem with hungry jack with my tummy

8341
09:35:27,560 --> 09:35:29,560
um

8342
09:35:29,960 --> 09:35:34,200
Hungry jack is burger king in australia

8343
09:35:36,760 --> 09:35:40,040
Uh, yeah, like I have no desire for maca's here

8344
09:35:41,080 --> 09:35:44,200
Because of that fact. So honestly, thank you

8345
09:35:45,320 --> 09:35:49,320
Australia maca's because I don't really consume your your foods

8346
09:35:51,320 --> 09:35:53,320
Mm-hmm

8347
09:35:54,920 --> 09:36:01,160
We are at 8 000 florans. We're gonna weave it weave it low. Actually, I need to send those

8348
09:36:01,880 --> 09:36:07,000
Assassins on a mission because they should not be sitting in my bar right now

8349
09:36:08,200 --> 09:36:13,960
I'm gonna do uh an arrow storm because you have to do 15 arrow storms 12 12 tailors renovated

8350
09:36:14,760 --> 09:36:18,120
I did an arrow storm and for some reason it didn't hurt him

8351
09:36:18,920 --> 09:36:20,920
No

8352
09:36:25,160 --> 09:36:28,600

8355
09:36:37,480 --> 09:36:39,880
You cheeky man. It's just

8356
09:36:41,240 --> 09:36:43,240
Out of all

8357
09:36:44,040 --> 09:36:46,040
streamers

8358
09:36:46,040 --> 09:36:48,040
You mean me

09:36:48,840 --> 09:36:50,840
It's why

8360
09:36:51,240 --> 09:36:56,200
I will take your word for it and I will exchange for your words

8361
09:36:57,080 --> 09:36:58,840
my gratitude

8362
09:36:58,840 --> 09:37:01,400
for being open to a new

8363
09:37:02,680 --> 09:37:05,720
person's content because

8364
09:37:06,600 --> 09:37:09,560
it is very natural to

8365
09:37:10,360 --> 09:37:16,840
Um, find someone you enjoy and not deviate from them. So the fact that you were willing to

8366
09:37:17,800 --> 09:37:22,280
Maybe deviate from who you consume. I appreciate that and I

8367
09:37:23,080 --> 09:37:28,280
Exchange my gratitudes and I'm very thankful you gave me a chance and I am glad I

8368
09:37:28,920 --> 09:37:29,960
Even in my own way

8369
09:37:29,960 --> 09:37:35,800
Like I don't feel pressured in the stream to like perform to do anything to to crack these jokes to do this to do that

8370
09:37:36,120 --> 09:37:41,400
Like I am so glad I can just be myself and you're like, yeah

8371
09:37:42,040 --> 09:37:43,800

Um

Righty who we do have a viewpoint down in this district and a few missing buildings

8381
09:38:10,680 --> 09:38:15,720
I might go get a cola just to energize me and quickly order some

8382
09:38:16,840 --> 09:38:18,680
Take away

8383
09:38:18,680 --> 09:38:20,040
um

8384
09:38:20,040 --> 09:38:25,880
We can have a little nibble very quickly and then we can explore

8385
09:38:27,000 --> 09:38:30,920
The uh, I'm actually gonna poison these guards. That sounds terrible, but

8386
09:38:31,880 --> 09:38:33,880
um, and

8387
09:38:35,080 --> 09:38:42,280
Actually that reminds me why haven't I got the court is on sorry. I'm getting sorry. I'm getting I'm getting hit on purpose

8388
09:38:42,360 --> 09:38:49,640
I'm not just playing bad like that. I thought there was a court is on poison five guards. Is it poison 15 guards?

8389
09:38:51,480 --> 09:38:53,480
Maybe it's poison 15 guards

8390
09:38:54,760 --> 09:39:00,520
So it's scheduled successfully ruined. I still don't know if she can feel her. I've been my new obsession. Oh, I'm so glad

09:39:01,080 --> 09:39:03,080
Thank you

8393
09:39:10,120 --> 09:39:11,560
sorry

8394
09:39:11,640 --> 09:39:16,360
Of words are hard. I've been around too many people who made me feel that

8395
09:39:16,760 --> 09:39:20,440
Pressuring myself was normal. So nice to see people your mindset. Just be genuine

8396
09:39:23,160 --> 09:39:25,160
Literally I'm gonna cough um

8397
09:39:25,800 --> 09:39:30,760
Yeah, excuse me. Uh, I'm actually pretty low on water. So I will need to call a break very shortly

8398
09:39:32,520 --> 09:39:34,520

09:39:40,040 --> 09:39:42,840
Is it weird to say like autism friendly streamer?

Oh, we've got a nice bit of money with that. Uh, what we are we are level eight

Yeah, okay, uh, we might be able to do a first five star mission

8406
09:40:01,320 --> 09:40:03,320

Little pass

8414
09:40:44,280 --> 09:40:48,920
Probably um, I had a I've already had three cups of tea. So I think that's been done for tea for the day

8415
09:40:49,080 --> 09:40:51,080
I was like cling my teacup

8416
09:40:51,240 --> 09:40:52,840

But yes, I'll be three minutes

8418
09:40:54,440 --> 09:40:58,360
I highly recommend that you get up and stretch your little legs

09:40:58,680 --> 09:41:03,720
Um, get a little stretch go to the toilet get any more hydration you may need

8420
09:41:04,520 --> 09:41:07,560
Um, I do have a bit of a different

8421
09:41:08,520 --> 09:41:13,160
Conclusion to the end of this stream because I got a unique marshmallow. Um

8422
09:41:14,200 --> 09:41:18,040
But I'll talk about when I get back. It's nothing bad. Please don't panic. Absolutely nothing bad

8423
09:41:18,040 --> 09:41:20,040
No one's done anything

8424
09:41:20,040 --> 09:41:25,000
Uh, but I would like to talk about it and we will try our best to help each other out as we do

8425
09:41:25,480 --> 09:41:26,600
Um

8426
09:41:26,600 --> 09:41:27,960
Okay, I will do the thing

8427
09:41:27,960 --> 09:41:32,520
I always do it where I'm actually going to claim up so a thief doesn't take any of my money

8428
09:41:32,520 --> 09:41:37,240
Because I would like to keep my money so I can keep renovating buildings and all that

8429
09:41:38,120 --> 09:41:43,000
Uh, so I will give you this beautiful sight of roma

You

8444
09:43:20,520 --> 09:43:22,520
Oh

8445
09:43:50,520 --> 09:43:52,520
You

8446
09:44:20,520 --> 09:44:22,520
You

8447
09:44:50,520 --> 09:44:52,520
You

8448
09:45:20,520 --> 09:45:22,520
You

8449
09:45:50,520 --> 09:45:52,520
You

8450
09:46:20,520 --> 09:46:22,520
You

8451
09:46:50,520 --> 09:46:52,520
You

8452
09:47:20,520 --> 09:47:22,520
You

8453
09:47:50,920 --> 09:47:55,720
You've been enjoying the background music of this game. It's goaded

8454
09:47:57,400 --> 09:47:59,400
It's goaded up all the time

8455
09:48:02,840 --> 09:48:07,160
Uh, it looks like we got one recruit back so far

8456
09:48:08,440 --> 09:48:10,440
We do have 10k. That's good money

8457
09:48:10,760 --> 09:48:16,200
I have water and I have a can of cola got better better fizzy juice

8458
09:48:16,520 --> 09:48:21,560
But if it's a juice for me, it's probably the worst thing I could do for my throat right now, but

8459
09:48:23,400 --> 09:48:25,400
Honestly, honestly

8460
09:48:26,680 --> 09:48:28,680
Does it even matter?

8461
09:48:30,280 --> 09:48:35,160
Like I can already feel I have nodules in my throat who cares it's too late. Leave me behind

8462
09:48:37,320 --> 09:48:42,920
Mmm, we do have very high. Okay. Yeah, levelly. He can just absolutely beast that

8463
09:48:43,880 --> 09:48:46,920
All right, let's go on business. What's your opinion on iron brew?

8464
09:48:47,480 --> 09:48:53,560
Did you know the most popular fizzy juice sold worldwide is cola?

8465
09:48:54,200 --> 09:48:56,040
except

8466
09:48:56,040 --> 09:49:03,080
For in scotland the only country where the number one sold fizzy juice is iron brew

8467
09:49:03,400 --> 09:49:05,400
And I do like iron brew. It's very good

8468
09:49:05,960 --> 09:49:11,400
Um, vim too is also very good if you have a uh, we're going this way. I remember now. Um

8469
09:49:13,720 --> 09:49:18,280
If you have fish and chips, vim too is very good for cutting the grease like

8470
09:49:18,760 --> 09:49:22,600
Sprite as well. It helps to cut the grease of your takeaway

8471
09:49:24,360 --> 09:49:26,360
Never had iron brew, but I want it

8472
09:49:28,200 --> 09:49:32,600
Um, if you are in australia, you can go to your willies

8473
09:49:33,480 --> 09:49:36,360
And they actually sell it in the british section

8474
09:49:37,320 --> 09:49:44,040
Unbelievably, it's at a premium rate, but make sure you refrigerate it iron brew should never be consumed at room temperature

8475
09:49:44,120 --> 09:49:49,640
Please do not do that to yourself and please understand. It is an acquired taste

8476
09:49:50,360 --> 09:49:55,480
But children of scotland were basically raised on neon orange

8477
09:49:56,280 --> 09:49:57,480
drink

8478
09:49:57,480 --> 09:49:59,480
So, yeah

8479
09:50:00,280 --> 09:50:02,280
Um

8480
09:50:03,880 --> 09:50:11,560
What does it taste like so iron brew themselves have said it's supposed to taste like ginger and bubblegum

8481
09:50:12,120 --> 09:50:15,240
It absolutely does not at all

8482
09:50:16,120 --> 09:50:19,240
taste like that i'm actually going to hire these because I need to do

8483
09:50:20,600 --> 09:50:22,120
distract

8484
09:50:22,120 --> 09:50:24,280
Um, it does not taste like this at all

8485
09:50:25,000 --> 09:50:31,400
I don't even I could not tell you anything remotely what it tastes like other than battery acid

8486
09:50:32,920 --> 09:50:35,960
Yeah, if you've ever smelled battery acid

8487
09:50:38,120 --> 09:50:41,960
Uh, that's what iron brew tastes like but like not bad

8488
09:50:42,600 --> 09:50:44,200
battery acid

8489
09:50:44,200 --> 09:50:45,880
You're still alive

8490
09:50:45,880 --> 09:50:47,800
Yes, sorry

8491
09:50:47,800 --> 09:50:52,840
We have finished the main campaign. We are currently renovating all of roma

8492
09:50:53,400 --> 09:50:58,840
We've started our serious landlord enterprise. It's going pretty well if I do say so myself

8493
09:51:00,040 --> 09:51:02,040
and

8494
09:51:02,200 --> 09:51:04,200
Willy Wonker and iron brew no

8495
09:51:07,080 --> 09:51:09,800
So basically mountain dew um

8496
09:51:12,600 --> 09:51:15,800
I did get an opportunity to taste mountain dew

8497
09:51:17,000 --> 09:51:19,000
I

8498
09:51:19,000 --> 09:51:23,240
Honestly wouldn't fault you. Yeah, I would say that's probably the closest ever

8499
09:51:23,960 --> 09:51:28,760
Taste you would get to iron brew, but it is still different. What are you mining?

8500
09:51:29,560 --> 09:51:31,560
Play minecraft out here

8501
09:51:32,440 --> 09:51:37,800
He's tilling the soil with a pickaxe. You're supposed to use a hole for tilling soil

8502
09:51:40,040 --> 09:51:45,480
Wait, are you beating the whole game? Uh, I have already done the campaign

8503
09:51:46,360 --> 09:51:52,280
Uh, like which means the story like chesery has been perished to fate itself because no man can murder me

8504
09:51:53,240 --> 09:51:57,800
We are now going through the map and renovate renovate and combine all the buildings

8505
09:51:58,200 --> 09:52:03,560
And then next we're going to do the layers of romulus which are these little wolf marks here

8506
09:52:04,280 --> 09:52:08,120
And if we have time we will do the leonardo missions

8507
09:52:09,240 --> 09:52:14,120
And the catarina missions and the auditory family missions

8508
09:52:15,640 --> 09:52:20,040
We are going to stop at the 12 hour mark very sadly

8509
09:52:20,920 --> 09:52:23,800
Not because I don't actually want to stream more

8510
09:52:24,440 --> 09:52:28,520
But because vods for some reason freak out

8511
09:52:29,640 --> 09:52:36,840
After the 12 hour mark and it is such a shame because if it didn't I think I could confidently

8512
09:52:37,640 --> 09:52:39,640
Finish all the mission

8513
09:52:41,400 --> 09:52:43,080
Which is a shame

8514
09:52:43,080 --> 09:52:46,520
Because definitely could do it if it wasn't for the

8515
09:52:48,120 --> 09:52:52,840
BOD issues so uh mercy is live right now. I am t-minus two hours

8516
09:52:53,880 --> 09:52:55,880
um

8517
09:52:56,120 --> 09:52:58,120
Start a new stream easy peasy

8518
09:52:59,400 --> 09:53:08,360
I am tempted however, um, there is a yumi plus member waiting on my side of an ace marco lab

8519
09:53:09,000 --> 09:53:13,800
And I don't want to leave her waiting. I also have to contact dempo fish

8520
09:53:14,360 --> 09:53:16,360
about the ace marco lab

8521
09:53:16,680 --> 09:53:24,200
Um, and I really don't want anyone to think I am taking their kindness and their time for granted

8522
09:53:24,680 --> 09:53:26,680
because on top of streaming

8523
09:53:26,840 --> 09:53:33,400
If someone comes to you asking for an ace marco lab and you do this and you do that like these girls are so hard working

8524
09:53:33,960 --> 09:53:35,000
and

8525
09:53:35,000 --> 09:53:39,560
I know some people might find streaming looks very easy on the surface

8526
09:53:39,720 --> 09:53:45,320
but people have lives and they have things going on and they have ailments and

8527
09:53:45,960 --> 09:53:47,640
They have family issues

8528
09:53:47,640 --> 09:53:53,000
They have they might even not even be able to stream as much as they like due to their living situation like

8529
09:53:53,560 --> 09:53:57,080
I just want to respect the time that I ask and

8530
09:53:57,960 --> 09:54:01,960
Give the girls like these ace marco labs like get it all sorted out and

8531
09:54:02,360 --> 09:54:07,880
Because if they've been kind enough to give me the time of day, I want to completely wholeheartedly respect that. Um

8532
09:54:09,080 --> 09:54:11,080
So hopefully tomorrow

8533
09:54:11,880 --> 09:54:12,840
um

8534
09:54:12,840 --> 09:54:18,840
Before I stream uh yumi will have a collab of me and her on her channel

8535
09:54:19,320 --> 09:54:22,440
If all goes well, sadly the ace mar

8536
09:54:23,400 --> 09:54:30,680
Memes for all violour members is paused right now until I know what's going on with monetization

8537
09:54:31,480 --> 09:54:33,480
and culling because

8538
09:54:35,000 --> 09:54:37,000
um

8539
09:54:37,800 --> 09:54:39,560
The memes are quite fun

8540
09:54:39,560 --> 09:54:47,400
But the nature of them depending on how mean youtube want to be recently with ace mar. It's quite uh nerve wracking

8541
09:54:48,520 --> 09:54:50,520
at the moment

8542
09:54:51,240 --> 09:54:57,400
Talking about ace mar. Did you give any of the girls advice for their first ace mar streams? Um only one girl

8543
09:54:57,960 --> 09:54:59,960
uh came to me for

8544
09:55:00,440 --> 09:55:02,120
Advice

8545
09:55:02,120 --> 09:55:05,080
I don't think she'd be embarrassed if I said um

8546
09:55:06,360 --> 09:55:08,360
Lovely azura has never

8547
09:55:09,240 --> 09:55:14,520
So she's she's never made ace mar herself. However, she has consumed the content

8548
09:55:15,160 --> 09:55:16,360
um

8549
09:55:16,360 --> 09:55:18,600
But because she's a yapper

8550
09:55:19,240 --> 09:55:21,720
She's like I can't really focus and know what to say

8551
09:55:22,200 --> 09:55:28,120
So I gave her a very small page of prompts that she can say just to help her out

8552
09:55:28,680 --> 09:55:33,160
So please do enjoy her ace mar stream when she does it to the full extent

8553
09:55:33,880 --> 09:55:34,920
um

8554
09:55:34,920 --> 09:55:39,720
Because she's just very lovely. Um, I think she's just a wee bit

8555
09:55:40,360 --> 09:55:43,800
Unconfident, but I am sure with the love she gets from

8556
09:55:44,680 --> 09:55:47,960
Her bleeding hearts. I don't know if bleeding hearts is getting changed

8557
09:55:48,440 --> 09:55:51,480
But the love that you guys will show will instill

8558
09:55:52,120 --> 09:55:55,880
The confidence that I know she will have one day

8559
09:55:56,840 --> 09:56:01,720
And you know doing this and uh, yeah, as I said, I've got faith in it

8560
09:56:03,000 --> 09:56:06,680
Gonna have to try and someplace around here that sells. I'm bro. My interest has me peaked

8561
09:56:08,120 --> 09:56:09,800
Willys

8562
09:56:09,800 --> 09:56:15,640
Willys go to the british section or the indian section at willys. I kid you not. They're at the same section

8563
09:56:17,720 --> 09:56:18,760
Um

8564
09:56:18,760 --> 09:56:21,400
We'll take great care of mama as yes

8565
09:56:22,360 --> 09:56:28,920
Um, she is very caring naturally like I kid you not like it's not a role play

8566
09:56:29,480 --> 09:56:32,360
Like she is very caring naturally

8567
09:56:33,080 --> 09:56:34,760
um

8568
09:56:34,760 --> 09:56:39,560
And as her confidence grows, I think it'll very it will come across

8569
09:56:40,440 --> 09:56:46,120
Um, and I'm just very excited to watch her blossom as a streamer because

8570
09:56:47,800 --> 09:56:49,800
She she's just

8571
09:56:50,760 --> 09:56:52,760
She's being propelled

8572
09:56:53,080 --> 09:56:55,800
Not into a new world. She has had very

8573
09:56:57,000 --> 09:57:05,000
Long history of streaming, but she's definitely been propelled. I think is the fair word to say and um

8574
09:57:05,640 --> 09:57:13,000
You know, she's trying out new things and I'm I'm absolutely I'm all for I I hope um, she feels

8575
09:57:13,880 --> 09:57:17,800
Able to reach out to me as I said with all the girls they have reached out to me at one point

8576
09:57:17,880 --> 09:57:25,320
And you know, I advise the best I can but the true fact of the day is all the girls have more streaming experience than me

8577
09:57:25,800 --> 09:57:26,840
so

8578
09:57:26,840 --> 09:57:28,840
There's like only

8579
09:57:28,920 --> 09:57:30,920
So much value to my words

8580
09:57:31,480 --> 09:57:33,480
and it's like

8581
09:57:33,560 --> 09:57:35,160
my darlin

8582
09:57:35,160 --> 09:57:42,520
My darlin, I love you, but I can't give you advice on this because the fact of the matter is you're more experienced than me

8583
09:57:43,320 --> 09:57:50,680
And like it's okay to experiment. It's okay to find figure things out. Um, it's okay to do these things

8584
09:57:51,480 --> 09:57:58,440
Um, I think we've fully renovated everything but this missed aqueduct possibly uh other than the

8585
09:58:00,280 --> 09:58:07,160
Location so I think we'll actually do a layer of romuli. Uh, there's one down here. So we'll do this one first

8586
09:58:07,560 --> 09:58:11,800
My darlin. Yes, like I'm kind of like my darlin

8587
09:58:13,080 --> 09:58:17,240
There is a point, uh, which pains me to admit but

8588
09:58:18,360 --> 09:58:21,240
There's a point where I'm of no use to you

8589
09:58:22,040 --> 09:58:26,280
Um, there's only so much my knowledge so far goes

8590
09:58:26,280 --> 09:58:30,680
Like I definitely have knowledge of the ASMR side of things audio roleplay side of things

8591
09:58:31,320 --> 09:58:33,320
But stream advice

8592
09:58:34,120 --> 09:58:40,040
Uh, my stream advice is I've just done what I want and it worked out

8593
09:58:40,600 --> 09:58:45,960
And the truth of that fact is that is not how it works for everyone

8594
09:58:46,600 --> 09:58:53,640
And it's just not possible and it is not responsible either for me to give streaming advice

8595
09:58:54,520 --> 09:58:56,120
like that

8596
09:58:56,120 --> 09:59:00,680
Knowing full well, that's not how it works for everyone and I think it's um

8597
09:59:01,160 --> 09:59:05,640
Um, I think it's perfectly okay to admit um

8598
09:59:06,840 --> 09:59:13,240
I'm sorry, but I'm not knowledgeable enough. I can come up with fun stream ideas. I can come up with fun collab ideas

8599
09:59:13,240 --> 09:59:15,400
I can come up with fun event ideas

8600
09:59:16,120 --> 09:59:18,280
But to actually sit on stream

8601
09:59:19,160 --> 09:59:21,880
I'm not the streamer. You're the streamer

8602
09:59:22,840 --> 09:59:24,600
You know

8603
09:59:24,600 --> 09:59:26,600
And uh, I have full faith

8604
09:59:26,680 --> 09:59:29,640
They will do make they will do nothing

8605
09:59:30,280 --> 09:59:36,520
Less than make me proud. Do nothing but make me proud. Yeah, do nothing but make me proud

8606
09:59:37,080 --> 09:59:41,720
Um, not that it's their responsibility to prove themselves to me

8607
09:59:42,680 --> 09:59:48,280
Because they proved themselves to me long ago. I saw myself in them and uh

8608
09:59:49,000 --> 09:59:56,440
Different ways for me. I saw the shitposting side of me for she be I saw the side of me that

8609
09:59:57,320 --> 10:00:03,640
Literally just needed a hand up. That's all I needed. She be as fully stacked to go. She just needed a hand up

8610
10:00:04,200 --> 10:00:07,400
Um, Azura just needed a chance. Um

8611
10:00:08,600 --> 10:00:10,600
mercedes

8612
10:00:10,680 --> 10:00:15,160
Determination that her unending unending stamina

8613
10:00:15,960 --> 10:00:17,240
um

8614
10:00:17,240 --> 10:00:22,920
And I say her experience to hone her craft like I see

8615
10:00:23,640 --> 10:00:25,640
myself in these little

8616
10:00:26,040 --> 10:00:27,640
little

8617
10:00:27,640 --> 10:00:28,840
parts

8618
10:00:28,840 --> 10:00:30,840
Which made it so easy

8619
10:00:32,040 --> 10:00:37,080
to relate to the girls to have trust in the girls to have faith in the girls and

8620
10:00:37,880 --> 10:00:39,000
um

8621
10:00:39,000 --> 10:00:41,000
That's just the fact of the matter

8622
10:00:41,640 --> 10:00:43,000
um

8623
10:00:43,000 --> 10:00:50,200
And all of them have so much potential and I really hope that viola gives them

8624
10:00:51,240 --> 10:00:53,240
that opportunity

8625
10:00:53,320 --> 10:00:54,360
to

8626
10:00:54,360 --> 10:00:58,920
Bring themselves to the next level and achieve what their dreams are

8627
10:00:59,560 --> 10:01:05,560
When it comes to being a content creator a streamer oopsies ran off the wall. Um

8628
10:01:07,640 --> 10:01:09,640
And yeah

8629
10:01:10,680 --> 10:01:12,680
That's that's just me

8630
10:01:14,040 --> 10:01:18,280
I'm just so happy. Uh, yes, this looks like I'm going around in circles

8631
10:01:19,160 --> 10:01:23,480
It's part of the map. Um, so this is before yellow paint is a thing

8632
10:01:24,200 --> 10:01:30,200
Uh, because Assassin's Creed use torches for these parts of the chambers if you go the wrong way

8633
10:01:30,680 --> 10:01:32,360
Then you're just going to get money

8634
10:01:32,360 --> 10:01:38,840
Which is fine if you want to collect boxes. There are flags as well, but we're not doing the flags just yet

8635
10:01:38,840 --> 10:01:40,840
We're doing that tomorrow

8636
10:01:41,240 --> 10:01:43,240
But for now

8637
10:01:44,120 --> 10:01:46,120
Did I need to go that way?

8638
10:01:47,080 --> 10:01:51,480
Mom me what scrawny sounds like a mom gasping up her kids

8639
10:01:52,600 --> 10:01:54,280
honestly though

8640
10:01:54,280 --> 10:02:00,680
Like I didn't really know what to expect them to like call me and stuff and they all call me mom

8641
10:02:02,520 --> 10:02:04,520
Which I adore um

8642
10:02:05,640 --> 10:02:08,120
And they're all like, oh, I love you scrawny and I'm like, oh

8643
10:02:08,440 --> 10:02:13,560
We're passing around the L word and I'm like, oh because like I didn't want to be the first one to say that

8644
10:02:14,440 --> 10:02:15,560
But like

8645
10:02:15,560 --> 10:02:17,560
I love you too. Like my god

8646
10:02:17,640 --> 10:02:18,920
thank you for like

8647
10:02:18,920 --> 10:02:24,680
believing in me and seeing the goal and and believing in yourself to like reach out and grab it

8648
10:02:25,400 --> 10:02:32,280
um, if you've ever kind of looked around on vtuber applications like applications open now

8649
10:02:32,840 --> 10:02:36,360
the most common tweet under these things is

8650
10:02:37,160 --> 10:02:43,400
Like I am not confident enough to go out and reach for this and it is such

8651
10:02:43,960 --> 10:02:45,240
a shame

8652
10:02:45,240 --> 10:02:51,080
Because truly it is you miss a hundred percent of the things you don't go for and like it's just

8653
10:02:51,800 --> 10:02:53,800
I almost fell down. Um

8654
10:02:54,200 --> 10:02:56,200
it's just like such a shame

8655
10:02:56,360 --> 10:02:57,480
but

8656
10:02:57,480 --> 10:03:05,320
like good on the girls for reaching out and basically letting me grab their hand like thank you for

8657
10:03:05,880 --> 10:03:07,880
letting me do that for you. Um

8658
10:03:08,520 --> 10:03:09,480
type thing

8659
10:03:09,480 --> 10:03:13,480
Like thank you for enabling yourself to enable me. It's what I'm trying to say

8660
10:03:15,080 --> 10:03:19,560
I like your stamina. I wasn't expecting it. You should see me in the bedroom. Sorry. I was just

8661
10:03:20,440 --> 10:03:22,440
I'm sorry. I apologize

8662
10:03:24,040 --> 10:03:26,040
She's still streaming. Yes or e

8663
10:03:26,600 --> 10:03:31,960
Finish the campaign. We're now doing layers of Romulus which unblocks the special armor

8664
10:03:32,600 --> 10:03:36,680
Sorry, it was too easy. It was too easy. You made it so easy

8665
10:03:39,320 --> 10:03:41,320
I just checked

8666
10:03:42,440 --> 10:03:44,440
Oh

8667
10:03:46,600 --> 10:03:52,840
Opsies, I just realized this is not a jump down and I realized the second I launched at that skeleton

8668
10:03:54,200 --> 10:03:55,400
You can

8669
10:03:55,400 --> 10:03:57,880
Drop and grab at these sections

8670
10:03:57,960 --> 10:04:02,600
I really do not like dropping and grabbing because it's kind of hard to judge where you're to go next

8671
10:04:03,000 --> 10:04:05,000
um

8672
10:04:05,400 --> 10:04:06,840
However

8673
10:04:06,840 --> 10:04:09,880
The camera does assist you mildly

8674
10:04:10,840 --> 10:04:15,320
And it's a bit of a really do you have to do it like that? But yeah

8675
10:04:19,480 --> 10:04:21,320
Yeah

8676
10:04:21,320 --> 10:04:23,320
Aren't you a quick show though?

8677
10:04:23,640 --> 10:04:25,400
You shut the hell up

8678
10:04:25,400 --> 10:04:27,400
You freaking freaks

8679
10:04:27,480 --> 10:04:30,760
I tell you that in confidence and you throw it on my face

8680
10:04:33,240 --> 10:04:35,240
I'm trying to remember which one this is again

8681
10:04:35,320 --> 10:04:39,080
Just follow the light if you ever get confused at the section of the game

8682
10:04:39,640 --> 10:04:47,560
Uh the game when you're in catacomb like levels the game will unironically light the way to tell you where to go

8683
10:04:48,200 --> 10:04:51,960
Again, we're getting teased by that flag, but we don't why did you not grab that?

8684
10:04:52,520 --> 10:04:54,520
Is anyone supposed to go there?

8685
10:04:55,080 --> 10:05:01,240
Am I not supposed to go there? No, I'm supposed to go there. It's you. You're teasing me

8686
10:05:01,960 --> 10:05:07,560
Such a naughty naughty. It's you grab the ledge. Yeah, so you were supposed to grab it

8687
10:05:09,720 --> 10:05:13,880
I've never played assassin you bought games, but haven't played them

8688
10:05:15,960 --> 10:05:17,960
Hey, it's all

8689
10:05:18,280 --> 10:05:24,200
Um, maybe you work a lot and you think the game looks good and then you say to yourself

8690
10:05:24,280 --> 10:05:29,160
I'll play it when I'm not tired, but then after work you're like man. I'm exhausted

8691
10:05:29,240 --> 10:05:31,480
I don't really feel like playing a new game

8692
10:05:32,040 --> 10:05:37,320
And then you feel like playing games that you're familiar with and that is the power of nostalgia

8693
10:05:39,400 --> 10:05:41,400
Very powerful drug

8694
10:05:41,960 --> 10:05:45,720
And that is why media today is regurgitated a lot

8695
10:05:46,680 --> 10:05:51,880
Because of the power of nostalgia unironically, that's why they have Beal just who coming out

8696
10:05:58,440 --> 10:06:01,160
It's really interesting learning about marketing trends as well

8697
10:06:03,160 --> 10:06:05,720
Hmm, maybe we could do a business

8698
10:06:06,440 --> 10:06:12,280
Analysing stream. I wouldn't mind yapping about that. I wouldn't mind yapping about biology as well. Um

8699
10:06:13,240 --> 10:06:15,240
I wanted to test an

8700
10:06:17,080 --> 10:06:19,080
Educational stream

8701
10:06:19,640 --> 10:06:21,320
um

8702
10:06:21,320 --> 10:06:24,040
I thought we could do a

8703
10:06:25,400 --> 10:06:27,400
Full stream day

8704
10:06:28,120 --> 10:06:32,120
And it's like literally like a full day at school again

8705
10:06:32,920 --> 10:06:34,760
and

8706
10:06:34,760 --> 10:06:38,680
Because I would be like, okay, we're doing English and then we're gonna like

8707
10:06:39,560 --> 10:06:44,680
And like I'm gonna wait unironically. I'm gonna ask questions and I'm gonna wait until someone gets it right

8708
10:06:46,440 --> 10:06:48,680
Who the heck just rated it in me

8709
10:06:49,640 --> 10:06:55,960
Rhea, how dare you Rhea? Hi Rhea. How was your stream? Hopefully I'm saying your name right. I apologize

8710
10:06:56,520 --> 10:06:58,520
But hi

8711
10:06:58,520 --> 10:07:00,760
How was your stream with a heck where you's dating?

8712
10:07:01,320 --> 10:07:08,760
I'm so sorry to uh raise uh viewers. I am Scottish. I apologize if you can't understand me so well

8713
10:07:08,840 --> 10:07:14,040
But hi raiders. Welcome in. We are playing Assassin's Creed brotherhood and

8714
10:07:16,280 --> 10:07:19,800
Jot invasion jot jet oat

8715
10:07:20,280 --> 10:07:22,280
Is that how you say it?

8716
10:07:22,440 --> 10:07:26,040
Uh any joters? Well, hello joters and you come

8717
10:07:26,040 --> 10:07:31,960
Um, what were you playing or were you yapping? Were you speaking Japanese on on stream?

8718
10:07:34,840 --> 10:07:41,160
Although you're probably exhausted after stream to be honest, you're like, please strongy. Don't ask me any questions. I'm exhausted

8719
10:07:41,720 --> 10:07:43,720
That's fair. That's fair

8720
10:07:44,200 --> 10:07:48,840
Uh, we are playing uh, Assassin's Creed brotherhood

8721
10:07:49,240 --> 10:07:54,600
Uh, and we're doing the catacombs which have been lighted lighted the path that they have been lit

8722
10:07:55,320 --> 10:07:57,320
Um, and it tells us where to go

8723
10:08:01,080 --> 10:08:04,040
Strongies 365 so in Scottish, but it's actually

8724
10:08:05,960 --> 10:08:07,480
Yeah

8725
10:08:07,480 --> 10:08:12,360
Um, but yes, thank you so much for reading to me. I appreciate that. Please relax and rest well after stream

8726
10:08:12,920 --> 10:08:15,720
Uh, you've done a fantastic job pat yourself on the back

8727
10:08:16,600 --> 10:08:22,120
And for the jokes, uh, my name is strongy culls. I am part of valour

8728
10:08:23,080 --> 10:08:25,080
Umie plus were absolutely

8729
10:08:25,480 --> 10:08:29,560
Lovely and did a watch along of our debuts. We are incredible new

8730
10:08:30,040 --> 10:08:35,960
Um, and I am strongy the scottish cuttlefish. I am an endurance streamer and today we are playing

8731
10:08:36,760 --> 10:08:42,840
Assassin's Creed brotherhood. We have completed the storyline the main quest line the campaign

8732
10:08:43,480 --> 10:08:47,960
Uh, and we are currently doing what's known as the lair of romulus

8733
10:08:48,680 --> 10:08:51,320
I just got stabbed if you saw that by throwing now

8734
10:08:51,880 --> 10:08:54,520
Uh, um, unfortunately the camera angles are a bit

8735
10:08:55,320 --> 10:09:02,120
However, uh, the games have held up quite well to the test of time because Assassin's Creed brotherhood was developed in

8736
10:09:02,840 --> 10:09:03,880
no

8737
10:09:03,880 --> 10:09:05,880
was released in

8738
10:09:06,440 --> 10:09:08,440
2010

8739
10:09:08,760 --> 10:09:10,760
um, and

8740
10:09:10,840 --> 10:09:12,840
um

8741
10:09:12,920 --> 10:09:18,440
It's a childhood game of mine. So I'm very happy to play it for a very long time. I'm just waiting for the sky to attack me

8742
10:09:18,680 --> 10:09:20,680
Apologies get a little distracted there

8743
10:09:22,280 --> 10:09:24,280
Okay, he just fell to his death

8744
10:09:25,800 --> 10:09:27,800
Hey, yeah

8745
10:09:29,240 --> 10:09:34,920
So development most likely was 2007, which is crazy to think about

8746
10:09:35,560 --> 10:09:37,880
Although it might have been on the back of

8747
10:09:38,120 --> 10:09:43,400
Assassin's Creed 2. I would 100% believe it was off the back of Assassin's Creed 2

8748
10:09:44,360 --> 10:09:47,160
Um, all things considered because brotherhood

8749
10:09:48,120 --> 10:09:50,120
Definitely. Oh, I'm tamed

8750
10:09:51,720 --> 10:09:57,400
I just I have seven seconds to complete the memory. Yeah. Good luck with that. We'll be replaying this one

8751
10:09:57,640 --> 10:10:00,360
I didn't realize I got tamed on the other ones as well

8752
10:10:02,040 --> 10:10:04,920
Filling me. Okay. Well, he just dodged that

8753
10:10:05,720 --> 10:10:09,960
Uh, can you maybe attack him? Gee, Louise

8754
10:10:12,280 --> 10:10:17,080
Oh my god, that was brutal. I just took his weapon from him and then uh ended him with that weapon

8755
10:10:19,160 --> 10:10:21,160
Rather brutal, but I'll take it

8756
10:10:22,440 --> 10:10:24,440
Restart time

8757
10:10:25,640 --> 10:10:28,520
We will rock you

8758
10:10:28,680 --> 10:10:30,680
Do

8759
10:10:31,000 --> 10:10:33,000
None of you are a big boy

8760
10:10:36,760 --> 10:10:40,760
You got mud on your face. Yeah, wait

8761
10:10:41,880 --> 10:10:47,640
No, I was so close to being the tame. I didn't know I was deli dalyan

8762
10:10:49,160 --> 10:10:54,520
I was deli dalyan so I didn't get 100% I can't believe it. I can't believe yapping has cost me 100%

8763
10:10:55,000 --> 10:11:00,280
Oh, no, it results in me having to stream more. Oh, what a punishment

8764
10:11:01,320 --> 10:11:04,120
We actually will open the chest because we're a bit low on funds

8765
10:11:06,680 --> 10:11:11,080
Yeah, I saw you at the beginning last night and now in the morning you're still here. Good job. Thank you

8766
10:11:11,400 --> 10:11:13,240
We finished the campaign

8767
10:11:13,240 --> 10:11:17,400
Doing layers of romuli. We're going to unlock the special armor in this game

8768
10:11:18,280 --> 10:11:21,320
Uh, not much treasures in these chests

8769
10:11:22,280 --> 10:11:28,200
So close and yet so far such a fake assassin's creed. I know I'm actually an assassin's creed fake fanboy

8770
10:11:33,160 --> 10:11:35,160
Oh, I can't believe it

8771
10:11:36,600 --> 10:11:38,440
I can't believe I missed that by a ball here

8772
10:11:38,920 --> 10:11:44,040
So say you missed something very closely in scots you say by a ball here

8773
10:11:44,120 --> 10:11:48,120
Which means exactly what you think it is by a ball here because of how short they are

8774
10:11:48,920 --> 10:11:50,920
So I missed it by a ball here

8775
10:11:52,680 --> 10:11:55,800
Angie, Angie, take a sip. Please remember to hydrate

8776
10:11:58,680 --> 10:12:00,280
Wow

8777
10:12:00,280 --> 10:12:07,960
That cola is chris b is exactly what one I wanted my good morning burp so bad on his floor

8778
10:12:10,360 --> 10:12:13,080
Imagine burping me after every time like

8779
10:12:14,040 --> 10:12:17,560
Like patting my back. Wait, where the heck are we? We didn't start in here

8780
10:12:18,280 --> 10:12:23,640
No, we were down here and now we're here. Okay. Are we closer to another layer?

8781
10:12:24,280 --> 10:12:27,160
That is where we get the treasure

8782
10:12:28,200 --> 10:12:31,960
There's one to the east. Okay. We will head east

8783
10:12:33,080 --> 10:12:38,520
Never eat shredded wheat is how you remember your north east south west

8784
10:12:40,200 --> 10:12:44,360
I won't lie. I've been studying a wikipedia list of scottish slang

8785
10:12:45,080 --> 10:12:49,560
Oh, there's so much but a lot of scottish slang isn't

8786
10:12:50,600 --> 10:12:52,200
used

8787
10:12:52,200 --> 10:12:54,200
So you might be studying

8788
10:12:55,080 --> 10:12:57,640
Too hard for the test that doesn't exist yet

8789
10:13:00,120 --> 10:13:02,120
But I do appreciate it

8790
10:13:02,360 --> 10:13:07,960
Uh, I do apologize for those of you whose english is not your first language

8791
10:13:08,920 --> 10:13:15,960
I can be a bit mumbly and hard to understand but I do try my best to enunciate words on stream

8792
10:13:17,080 --> 10:13:19,640
Just because my natural speaking voice

8793
10:13:20,440 --> 10:13:23,480
I kind of sound more like this and a bit more monotone

8794
10:13:24,360 --> 10:13:28,920
And it's no that i'm no interested or i'm disinterested but

8795
10:13:29,640 --> 10:13:34,040
I just kind of sound a bit more like this and it doesn't really sound that exciting

8796
10:13:34,920 --> 10:13:37,160
But it's not because i'm not having a good time

8797
10:13:37,880 --> 10:13:40,040
It's because i'm a mumbly

8798
10:13:40,600 --> 10:13:43,160
Bampot and I know i'm a mumbly bampot

8799
10:13:43,960 --> 10:13:45,960
So i'm undoing that treat

8800
10:13:47,720 --> 10:13:49,720
On the music the music is going to do the

8801
10:13:54,440 --> 10:13:58,120
Glorious soundtrack glorious soundtrack

8802
10:13:59,240 --> 10:14:01,720
I cannot recall of sassans 3 2

8803
10:14:02,680 --> 10:14:04,680
Uh, it's you it's the lever

8804
10:14:05,960 --> 10:14:07,960
Is it is it being pulled?

8805
10:14:09,480 --> 10:14:11,480
Okay

8806
10:14:11,480 --> 10:14:13,160
rude it's you

8807
10:14:13,160 --> 10:14:18,680
I'm going to scotland later this year. You're gonna look for nessie. Are you gonna lock lomond? If you guys didn't know

8808
10:14:19,560 --> 10:14:22,280
Nessie lives in lock lomond

8809
10:14:24,120 --> 10:14:26,120
And it's totally not

8810
10:14:26,600 --> 10:14:33,000
Uh, a capitalist ploy to get you to visit that location and support the

8811
10:14:33,720 --> 10:14:37,640
Piring a boat and buying drinks at that location. It's not a ploy

8812
10:14:38,680 --> 10:14:40,680
Nessie is real

8813
10:14:40,680 --> 10:14:41,800
and

8814
10:14:41,800 --> 10:14:44,280
Spend your hard-earned tourist money on us. Thank you

8815
10:14:46,520 --> 10:14:48,680
Three week round trip. That's so good

8816
10:14:49,720 --> 10:14:52,920
Blockness monster lives in lock lomond. Yes

8817
10:14:53,640 --> 10:14:55,640
Oh

10:14:56,600 --> 10:14:59,880
Is this one? Okay. Okay. This one isn't bad

8819
10:15:00,920 --> 10:15:03,960
Thankfully, there's no timer. We just have to not perish

8820
10:15:05,240 --> 10:15:08,040
Can you swim with nessie as a weak cut off fish?

8821
10:15:08,840 --> 10:15:10,840
Nessie was friendly

8822
10:15:10,920 --> 10:15:14,200
Um, nessie means no harm lower wise

8823
10:15:14,920 --> 10:15:16,200
um

8824
10:15:16,200 --> 10:15:20,120
And as long as you are good and don't pollute

8825
10:15:20,680 --> 10:15:25,320
Nessie couldn't give a hoot. Oh my god. That's the new motto. Thank you

8826
10:15:26,440 --> 10:15:30,840
Tourism scotland. I have you a new motto as long as you're good and don't

8827
10:15:32,200 --> 10:15:37,400
I've already forgotten it. What did I just say? What did I can you guys help me for meant for what I just said?

8828
10:15:38,440 --> 10:15:40,440
If you're good and don't

8829
10:15:40,920 --> 10:15:41,880
letter

8830
10:15:41,880 --> 10:15:43,880
Nessie will like you

8831
10:15:44,600 --> 10:15:49,400
Put put and I didn't even know it. Let's have already forgot I forgot

8832
10:15:50,440 --> 10:15:53,640
I think there's a flag behind me. It's right behind me, isn't it?

8833
10:15:55,240 --> 10:15:57,560
I knew it. I knew it. I remembered

8834
10:15:59,960 --> 10:16:03,640
If you're good and don't pollute now nessie will like you

8835
10:16:04,440 --> 10:16:09,800
Uh, there's nessie won't give a hoot. I'm so sorry. Wait. Is this not where I'm supposed to go?

8836
10:16:10,680 --> 10:16:12,520
Oh this

8837
10:16:12,600 --> 10:16:14,600
Wait

8838
10:16:16,360 --> 10:16:19,400
I just came from here

8839
10:16:21,080 --> 10:16:23,080
Am I not

8840
10:16:23,400 --> 10:16:29,560
Ah, I understand. I understand. There's a way this way. I could not see it. I could not see with my eyeballs

8841
10:16:31,880 --> 10:16:37,880
If you're cute and don't pollute nessie won't give a hoot. Yes. Nessie is cake. Nessie's not me

8842
10:16:38,920 --> 10:16:40,920
Okay, we did it. Yeah

8843
10:16:41,080 --> 10:16:48,280
Now these leaps look very big. That's because they are you have to hold grab while you do these leaps or it's you will not grab on

8844
10:16:49,560 --> 10:16:51,160
Oh

8845
10:16:51,160 --> 10:16:53,160
slow motion

8846
10:16:54,840 --> 10:17:00,760
Nessie everyone nessie is ugly people. Wow. Wow. Wow. This is news to me

8847
10:17:03,320 --> 10:17:05,960
That was crazy just coming out with that. Oh, there's a flag

8848
10:17:06,760 --> 10:17:08,760
I

8849
10:17:11,320 --> 10:17:16,680
Don't know how to get up there though. We'll do it later for now. We are just going to finish them

8850
10:17:17,640 --> 10:17:19,640
and then

8851
10:17:20,520 --> 10:17:23,640
Is that how I get up over there? No

8852
10:17:24,680 --> 10:17:28,200
Oh, I jumped from there. Right. How do I get up on you? Did I claim your hands?

8853
10:17:29,080 --> 10:17:30,840
Thank you for letting me claim your hands

8854
10:17:30,840 --> 10:17:37,480
I'm actually going to grab this right now because we might be able to get all of them from this level since there's no timer

8855
10:17:43,320 --> 10:17:45,320
Good catch. It's a very good catch

8856
10:17:47,080 --> 10:17:50,040
You have to be cute and not pollute. Oh, I get it now. I'm sorry

8857
10:17:50,920 --> 10:17:52,920
What's that? I already forgot me

8858
10:17:54,200 --> 10:17:56,200
Am I supposed to jump over there?

8859
10:17:57,160 --> 10:18:03,160
Ah, okay. Oh, okay. It was that way. I did. It did not look like I had to jump that way, but I guess I did

8860
10:18:04,680 --> 10:18:10,040
It's nice that I can continue watching you from the stream last night. Heck. Whoa. I thought I was about to go up there

8861
10:18:11,160 --> 10:18:17,960
I'm not gonna lie. I felt the gate brush against my butt. That's how close it was. My goodness. I was very nervous

8862
10:18:19,000 --> 10:18:21,000
Oh oopsies

8863
10:18:21,000 --> 10:18:27,400
Are you still no pan all this time? I'm so sorry. I don't know what that means

8864
10:18:28,440 --> 10:18:30,200
I apologize

8865
10:18:30,200 --> 10:18:35,480
Please may you give definition and re-ask the question kindly. Thank you. I appreciate it

8866
10:18:40,360 --> 10:18:42,360
Uh, right

8867
10:18:45,720 --> 10:18:47,720
No, panty. Oh

8868
10:18:48,040 --> 10:18:51,960
Yeah, I never put any more clothes on I don't need to

8869
10:18:54,520 --> 10:18:56,520
I almost jumped in there

8870
10:18:57,320 --> 10:19:02,040
Yeah, I don't really like I'm gonna say something are a little gross

8871
10:19:02,920 --> 10:19:08,200
But I don't go outside much. So, you know how like all the girls did those like smelly things

8872
10:19:08,680 --> 10:19:15,640
I was gonna do like what my smelly thing is and it's like deodorant optional basically because I don't go outside much

8873
10:19:18,280 --> 10:19:20,280
Which is kind of gross but I mean

8874
10:19:21,080 --> 10:19:23,080
If you want the truth

8875
10:19:23,080 --> 10:19:25,080
You can't handle the truth

8876
10:19:25,400 --> 10:19:30,200
Wait, we must just go up or in no in. Okay. No up

8877
10:19:32,120 --> 10:19:39,320
Is there a hidden thing back here? I keep thinking they're hating like a flag back. Oh, sorry. I wasn't paying attention

8878
10:19:39,320 --> 10:19:42,040
I apologize to that startled anyone. Bye bad

10:19:49,000 --> 10:19:51,400
I just like if I need to go out

8881
10:19:52,040 --> 10:19:54,440
Then like for example, I need to go buy those

8882
10:19:55,080 --> 10:19:58,840
Sweets. Whoa, I see. Oh, no, it's just the box. I thought it was a flag

8883
10:19:59,080 --> 10:20:04,600
Um, like I need to go buy those sweets. So I will get a shower and like I'll

8884
10:20:05,160 --> 10:20:09,960
Put deodorant on and wash my hair like I don't go out greasy or anything, but uh

8885
10:20:10,920 --> 10:20:12,920

8886
10:20:13,720 --> 10:20:16,760

8902
10:21:45,720 --> 10:21:52,840
We are for anyone who has just joined in I will do a quick recap. We are playing the greatest

8903
10:21:53,720 --> 10:21:57,960
And undeniably the best game of all time assassin's creed brother hood

8904
10:21:58,920 --> 10:22:03,000
We have successfully in our 10 hour stream

8905
10:22:03,800 --> 10:22:05,800
Have endeavored to

8906
10:22:06,760 --> 10:22:08,760
Complete campaign mode

8907
10:22:08,840 --> 10:22:13,160
We have also bought all renovations bar any tourist stick

8908
10:22:14,760 --> 10:22:16,760
Locations because of the price

8909
10:22:17,320 --> 10:22:25,560
We ran out of money. Um, so we are now doing the layer of romulus which unlocks the special armor in the game

8910
10:22:26,360 --> 10:22:28,360
Now this game came out in 2010

8911
10:22:29,400 --> 10:22:33,640
And it has done very well. Um, it has done fantastic

8912
10:22:34,760 --> 10:22:37,000
You're all breathtaking. No you

8913
10:22:38,040 --> 10:22:40,920
Uh, we are going to climb over here very carefully

8914
10:22:42,360 --> 10:22:45,000
We do have a bit of scary parkour so

8915
10:22:45,720 --> 10:22:51,400
For anyone who does not like heights sadly this section gets even worse than this bit

8916
10:22:51,960 --> 10:22:53,960
So if you suffer from any, uh

8917
10:22:55,080 --> 10:23:00,760
You know, uh, how is it vertical when height makes you go woozy?

8918
10:23:01,640 --> 10:23:05,240
Uh, not recommended that you watch this section

8919
10:23:06,200 --> 10:23:09,720
Have you ever you are oh no, is mercy still online?

8920
10:23:10,760 --> 10:23:13,720
Yeah, I think mercy's still online

8921
10:23:15,000 --> 10:23:17,000
Did you have a good stream today azerah?

8922
10:23:18,280 --> 10:23:20,280
I very sadly didn't get a chance to

8923
10:23:20,920 --> 10:23:22,040
uh

8924
10:23:22,040 --> 10:23:25,320
Watch any of it. Um, because I was too busy

8925
10:23:26,280 --> 10:23:30,680
Uh, well, I was too busy is not the right terminology. I apologize

8926
10:23:31,320 --> 10:23:36,840
I was streaming at the same time, but I did chat will vouch for me my little reeflings

8927
10:23:37,480 --> 10:23:39,480
I did tell them

8928
10:23:39,560 --> 10:23:44,520
To please enjoy your stream at will because I am an endurance streamer, and I'm glad you played the game too

8929
10:23:45,160 --> 10:23:47,880
Yeah, well, you're all know your game crashed

8930
10:23:48,760 --> 10:23:51,960
Do I need to teach you the in-video?

8931
10:23:52,840 --> 10:23:54,840
framerate

8932
10:23:55,480 --> 10:23:59,800
Uh, little thingy my bobber. I wonder why you crashed

8933
10:24:01,480 --> 10:24:04,440
Hmm that pc. Hmm. I'm wondering

8934
10:24:06,760 --> 10:24:09,240
Naughty pc we give it a few spanks for being naughty

8935
10:24:10,120 --> 10:24:16,920
I can't wait for azerah ASMR. Thankfully, uh, I'm pretty sure I can vouch for your pc azerah and say it's not going to explode

8936
10:24:17,400 --> 10:24:21,160
Uh, when you do ASMR because it's just you and the microphone

8937
10:24:21,400 --> 10:24:23,400
Um

8938
10:24:24,120 --> 10:24:28,040
We can give you white noise plugins as well if you would like to use that or if you want to just

8939
10:24:28,680 --> 10:24:32,840
ASMR stream is ASMR up to me. I wish I was that pc right now for a throw

8940
10:24:35,400 --> 10:24:39,560
We had fun chan. Oh, did you end up doing that too talking stream?

8941
10:24:41,400 --> 10:24:44,280
Where do I go from here down? Oh looks like I go down

8942
10:24:45,640 --> 10:24:50,840
Oh, did the gate open? Sorry. I'm too busy yapping the gate. Yeah, okay. That's swung open. Look at that

8943
10:24:52,120 --> 10:24:58,840
Oh, it's even got the sound effects. You know, this area is given Elden Ring. I said it

8944
10:24:59,640 --> 10:25:06,360
What do you mean that any sort of medieval esk type build is like Elden Ring?

8945
10:25:07,160 --> 10:25:10,600
I can't believe it the Elden Ring allegations

8946
10:25:11,000 --> 10:25:12,200
No, what was it?

8947
10:25:12,200 --> 10:25:16,040
What was the meme game where everyone was like this game's just like oh dark souls

8948
10:25:16,120 --> 10:25:20,680
That's it. This game's just like the did it is it of dark souls this game's like the did it did it of dark

8949
10:25:21,720 --> 10:25:24,200
I almost jumped down. Oh, thank god. I saw the ladder anyway

8950
10:25:25,320 --> 10:25:28,440
Yeah, I just talked afterwards. So it was yappy. Oh, that's good

8951
10:25:30,120 --> 10:25:31,880
Yes

8952
10:25:31,880 --> 10:25:39,000
Okay, we have collected the third scroll of Romulus only three more to go even though that says number five

8953
10:25:39,080 --> 10:25:41,720
So I'm doing it in the wrong order. I didn't know there was an order. I apologize

8954
10:25:42,600 --> 10:25:46,600
I thought the game kind of automatically like gave you this number that number

8955
10:25:47,640 --> 10:25:50,280
I'm not going to bother with the treasure chest because it was just so little

8956
10:25:53,880 --> 10:25:55,080
Wow

8957
10:25:55,080 --> 10:25:57,080
Have a little separatism

8958
10:25:57,400 --> 10:26:03,240
Gamers will see a Scottish castle and be like dark souls in real life. Can I tell you the dumbest thing ever?

8959
10:26:04,440 --> 10:26:06,440
One man wreck in Korea. That's a good thing

8960
10:26:07,160 --> 10:26:08,760
um

8961
10:26:08,760 --> 10:26:14,360
Was it modern warfare had a map based in scotland like that castle map?

8962
10:26:15,320 --> 10:26:16,280
um

8963
10:26:16,280 --> 10:26:23,560
In my dumb ass played it and I was like, this is so weird. This map feels so Scottish

8964
10:26:24,040 --> 10:26:26,840
and it was based after scotland and

8965
10:26:27,320 --> 10:26:30,280
Yeah, it didn't click until like after I looked it up

8966
10:26:31,880 --> 10:26:37,480
But I was like this feels so weird. It feels so Scottish. Why like why would they do that?

8967
10:26:37,480 --> 10:26:42,120
And I was like, oh, it's because it's based after gotland and castle and stuff. Yeah

8968
10:26:43,240 --> 10:26:49,080
Not very smart am I but yeah, I didn't I couldn't name the map out. I'd know it wasn't a black ops map

8969
10:26:50,200 --> 10:26:54,040
Because I pretty much know all the black ops map names, which is really sad

8970
10:26:54,200 --> 10:27:00,520
But is it sad if you enjoyed yourself? Is it sad? Oh, wow the bank has 31,000 in it

8971
10:27:02,200 --> 10:27:04,200
Hmm

8972
10:27:05,160 --> 10:27:07,960
Where's this Romulae? Is there a bank before it?

8973
10:27:09,080 --> 10:27:13,080
Ah, there isn't a bank right? We'll go back and pick up our money and then

8974
10:27:13,960 --> 10:27:15,960
we'll go

8975
10:27:17,320 --> 10:27:21,400
He'd been college at ghost plausible. I did play ghost

8976
10:27:22,600 --> 10:27:24,600
Very plausible. I shan't deny

8977
10:27:24,600 --> 10:27:28,520
I'll send my assassins away again because there's no point in having the assassins hanging around

8978
10:27:28,920 --> 10:27:33,960
When they could go be making like money and XP have we got another level eight? Yes, we do

8979
10:27:34,920 --> 10:27:41,400
We've got two three level eight four level eight. So that's fantastic. Okay. The assassins are definitely

8980
10:27:42,200 --> 10:27:43,960
getting very

8981
10:27:43,960 --> 10:27:46,120
potent now. They are getting very

8982
10:27:46,760 --> 10:27:48,760
Deadly which I'm quite happy with

8983
10:27:50,200 --> 10:27:52,680
Stonehaven that sounds like it

8984
10:27:53,560 --> 10:27:55,560
Yeah, me be me

8985
10:27:55,720 --> 10:28:04,920
Very dumb and be like, hmm. You feel you feel so familiar. I wonder why I just can't I just can't put my tongue on my

8986
10:28:05,800 --> 10:28:08,040
Uh, brain on why it feels so familiar

8987
10:28:10,360 --> 10:28:12,840
I'm a dumb dumb, but that's okay

8988
10:28:14,520 --> 10:28:16,520
I'm allowed to be a dumb dumb

8989
10:28:17,480 --> 10:28:19,480
Dum dum you give me gum gum

8990
10:28:19,960 --> 10:28:24,040
Oh, we're gonna watch night at the museum. I've not seen it since a child

8991
10:28:24,120 --> 10:28:29,400
So I'm gonna be laughing my buttocks off. I think watching that maybe

8992
10:28:31,160 --> 10:28:33,160
Maybe they do

8993
10:28:35,160 --> 10:28:37,160
Man no problem

8994
10:28:39,720 --> 10:28:43,880
Yeah, the map was every sniper heaven at heaven

8995
10:28:44,600 --> 10:28:46,600
On sniper heaven. Yeah

8996
10:28:47,720 --> 10:28:50,440
Wait, no, I need the money out of the bank. Goodness me. I'm getting distracted

8997
10:28:51,400 --> 10:28:53,400
silly silly

8998
10:28:54,120 --> 10:28:59,080
I learned once and I learned only recently that night at the museum had sequels

8999
10:29:00,360 --> 10:29:02,360
I don't

9000
10:29:03,800 --> 10:29:06,840
No, if I remember sequels

9001
10:29:07,400 --> 10:29:09,400
Hmm

9002
10:29:10,920 --> 10:29:14,360
Uh, hello horsey

9003
10:29:16,840 --> 10:29:22,840
All right, let's grab this horse and we'll go for a midnight stroll on our little horsey

9004
10:29:23,560 --> 10:29:27,080
And giddy up little I don't know what I would name a horse if I would one

9005
10:29:31,320 --> 10:29:33,320
Uh, what do horses do?

9006
10:29:33,880 --> 10:29:40,520
They gallop, let's go mr. Gallop giddy up giddy up bullseye

9007
10:29:45,640 --> 10:29:48,440
Look at the speed of you you're such a

9008
10:29:49,640 --> 10:29:54,760
And we've gone the wrong way, but that's okay because that was me that gated you there. So that's my bad. I apologize bullseye

9009
10:29:55,720 --> 10:29:57,720
Little little little

9010
10:29:59,480 --> 10:30:03,240
Oh, you're going so fast speedy Gonzales

9011
10:30:05,160 --> 10:30:07,160
I would name a horse Gerald

9012
10:30:08,120 --> 10:30:10,120
Gerald

9013
10:30:10,120 --> 10:30:14,520
Horsey make horse face true. Are you a winning son? Absolutely

9014
10:30:16,680 --> 10:30:19,720
I never lost yet I say that as I have like

9015
10:30:19,880 --> 10:30:27,640
De-synchronized a couple of times now and done like 50 percent passing on missions instead of 100 percent synchronicity

9016
10:30:30,360 --> 10:30:32,360
Where is it is it in here?

9017
10:30:34,280 --> 10:30:39,160
No, it's just really awkward one. Um, wait, what?

9018
10:30:39,800 --> 10:30:41,800
Is

9019
10:30:45,080 --> 10:30:51,320
This this one I remember from childhood and there's a like invisible ledge. Yes

9020
10:30:54,200 --> 10:30:55,960
Uh

9021
10:30:55,960 --> 10:31:01,160
Oh wait, I'm a dumb dumb. I thought the water was a lot higher

9022
10:31:02,200 --> 10:31:06,040
You you didn't see that you didn't see me try to figure out how to get in water

9023
10:31:06,600 --> 10:31:09,080
My pardon you're pardon. I beg

9024
10:31:13,160 --> 10:31:15,880
Yummy, amicola. I probably have some water too actually

9025
10:31:21,320 --> 10:31:26,200
Oh, what's this one do not lose more than 10 health squares they jumping me

9026
10:31:27,640 --> 10:31:29,880
Because if I'm losing health squares is a thing

9027
10:31:29,880 --> 10:31:36,600
Uh, I'm gonna need to be on my best behavior if I want a hundred percent this one and want to go

9028
10:31:40,920 --> 10:31:42,920
They obey

9029
10:31:45,000 --> 10:31:47,000
Bene, Bene, Molto Ben

9030
10:31:49,240 --> 10:31:53,880
Followers of Romulus or Ujiparis. Oh my goodness. There's snowberries

9031
10:31:54,760 --> 10:32:00,520
He he he I'm teasing I'm teasing I'm teasing and buzz-squeezing

9032
10:32:01,000 --> 10:32:05,800
I'm num, num, num, touch my body. I mean girls. Oh, that's not the words

9033
10:32:07,000 --> 10:32:11,400
This is the part where the rat breaks down. No one moves. No one makes a sound

9034
10:32:13,800 --> 10:32:15,800
Back from reality. They go grab it

9035
10:32:16,760 --> 10:32:18,760
I

9036
10:32:21,600 --> 10:32:25,640
Hate I hate tailing missions when they can attack me. I'm so sorry. I get so stressed

9037
10:32:27,800 --> 10:32:31,880
Yes, yes, yes Romulus commands the death of xy wild atory. Good luck for that mate

9038
10:32:33,160 --> 10:32:35,160
Get your wee knife out

9039
10:32:35,720 --> 10:32:37,720
And then wait for them to attack you

9040
10:32:38,360 --> 10:32:40,840
And then just chain attack whoever goes up

9041
10:32:41,400 --> 10:32:43,400
White is going to attack you next

9042
10:32:43,400 --> 10:32:48,900
You can lock on to them first, or you can counter as they do it.

9043
10:32:50,100 --> 10:32:50,900
No hit.

9044
10:32:56,400 --> 10:33:02,400
Yes, okay, I understand now why the 100% was don't lose health squares, because these are a lot.

9045
10:33:04,900 --> 10:33:08,400
Just wait for them to attack, and then counter, and then just go for it.

9046
10:33:09,400 --> 10:33:14,400
And then we need to run because it's a chase mission.

9047
10:33:15,700 --> 10:33:18,400
Well how do I do it? I'm just going for it.

9048
10:33:18,400 --> 10:33:20,700
Oh that was lucky I even hit that.

9049
10:33:21,400 --> 10:33:25,400
Please don't hurt me. I would like to get this 100%, so I don't have to play this one next.

9050
10:33:26,400 --> 10:33:29,400
Oh, he injured me. Oh they're jumping me, there's somebody.

9051
10:33:29,400 --> 10:33:31,400
Stop it, stop it, stop it.

9052
10:33:31,400 --> 10:33:35,240
stop stop stop.

9053
10:33:35,240 --> 10:33:37,040
Please.

9054
10:33:37,040 --> 10:33:40,480
Please.

9055
10:33:40,480 --> 10:33:41,420
Please.

9056
10:33:41,420 --> 10:33:42,420
Please.

9057
10:33:42,420 --> 10:33:43,420
Please.

9058
10:33:43,420 --> 10:33:44,420
Please.

9059
10:33:44,420 --> 10:33:45,420
Please.

9060
10:33:45,420 --> 10:33:46,920
But how do clips work on YouTube?

9061
10:33:46,920 --> 10:33:55,740
So if you clicked me, I can see what you clipped and then send it to an editor.

9062
10:33:55,740 --> 10:33:56,740
Basically.

9063
10:33:56,740 --> 10:34:01,040
There was the possibility of submitting clips on the Discord.

9064
10:34:01,040 --> 10:34:05,920
But then people would have to have speed peaking permissions.

9065
10:34:05,920 --> 10:34:07,480
Woo!

9066
10:34:07,480 --> 10:34:09,200
Oh, I'm not ready.

9067
10:34:09,200 --> 10:34:10,320
Oh, they're jumping me!

9068
10:34:10,320 --> 10:34:12,160
Oh, that was like insane reaction.

9069
10:34:12,160 --> 10:34:15,920
I just select the attack option in order to counter that.

9070
10:34:17,800 --> 10:34:19,960
Oh, I had a little mini heart, right?

9071
10:34:19,960 --> 10:34:22,840
I struggle with this area to know where to go next.

9072
10:34:22,840 --> 10:34:25,760
I assume this little lamp is telling.

9073
10:34:25,760 --> 10:34:26,760
Yeah, okay.

9074
10:34:26,760 --> 10:34:29,680
This little light of mine.

9075
10:34:29,680 --> 10:34:32,480
I'm going to let it show.

9076
10:34:32,480 --> 10:34:35,880
Please don't leave my health bars.

9077
10:34:35,880 --> 10:34:36,760
I'm jumping them.

9078
10:34:36,760 --> 10:34:39,160
I'm just, yeah, yeah, yeah.

9079
10:34:39,160 --> 10:34:40,280
Oh, you can't see me?

9080
10:34:40,280 --> 10:34:41,200
I can see.

9081
10:34:41,200 --> 10:34:42,640
Can you get your gun out?

9082
10:34:42,640 --> 10:34:43,560
Oh, I can see you.

9083
10:34:43,560 --> 10:34:45,480
Get wrecked.

9084
10:34:45,480 --> 10:34:46,800
Right, where am I going?

9085
10:34:46,800 --> 10:34:49,080
Actually, let me get my wee knife out again.

9086
10:34:49,080 --> 10:34:51,240
If it's all going to be wolves, there's

9087
10:34:51,240 --> 10:34:53,880
no point in no having.

9088
10:34:53,880 --> 10:34:55,600
I'm just going to get this real quick.

9089
10:34:55,600 --> 10:34:57,600
Don't mind anybody.

9090
10:34:57,600 --> 10:34:58,840
You're still going strong, eh?

9091
10:34:58,840 --> 10:34:59,680
Yes, sir.

9092
10:35:03,280 --> 10:35:04,960
Oh, there, hey, see that flag?

9093
10:35:04,960 --> 10:35:05,840
We're going to get it.

9094
10:35:05,840 --> 10:35:08,760
I'm getting up for the head of the event.

9095
10:35:08,760 --> 10:35:13,680
I wish you could climb in this little hole, but you can.

9096
10:35:13,680 --> 10:35:15,560
Pardon me, I'm sorry.

9097
10:35:15,560 --> 10:35:18,680
For being so rude, it wasn't me, it wasn't my food.

9098
10:35:18,680 --> 10:35:20,240
I say that as I've happened.

9099
10:35:20,240 --> 10:35:22,600
Right, remit.

9100
10:35:22,600 --> 10:35:25,240
Jesus, did not let me select a small knife there.

9101
10:35:25,400 --> 10:35:28,000
Wait for them to attack, and boom.

9102
10:35:28,000 --> 10:35:28,760
You just can't attack.

9103
10:35:28,760 --> 10:35:32,880
Boom, boom, oh, I'm getting, oh, they're jumping up.

9104
10:35:32,880 --> 10:35:34,880
And then boom.

9105
10:35:34,880 --> 10:35:36,840
And yeah, they're guarding.

9106
10:35:36,840 --> 10:35:37,960
That's fine.

9107
10:35:37,960 --> 10:35:40,640
We are going to do crossbow bolts.

9108
10:35:40,640 --> 10:35:42,200
Until they get too close, my goodness,

9109
10:35:42,200 --> 10:35:43,360
they get close fast.

9110
10:35:43,360 --> 10:35:45,200
Yeah, OK, OK.

9111
10:35:45,200 --> 10:35:47,520
Well, what are you aiming at, SAO darling?

9112
10:35:47,520 --> 10:35:49,600
Darling, they're in front of you.

9113
10:35:49,600 --> 10:35:51,560
And I don't want to replay the section

9114
10:35:51,560 --> 10:35:53,040
if I can get 100% first time.

9115
10:35:53,040 --> 10:35:54,280
Thank you.

9116
10:35:54,280 --> 10:35:57,200
Thank you, Etsy.

9117
10:35:57,200 --> 10:35:58,360
Thank you.

9118
10:35:58,360 --> 10:36:01,920
By the way, are you going to be playing Silent Hill?

9119
10:36:01,920 --> 10:36:04,760
I am very sorry for those of you who

9120
10:36:04,760 --> 10:36:07,640
might be interested in me playing Silent Hill.

9121
10:36:07,640 --> 10:36:11,000
I'm under the impression Silent Hill

9122
10:36:11,000 --> 10:36:15,000
are those games where you can't.

9123
10:36:15,000 --> 10:36:19,440
Oh, that was really rude, and I don't appreciate that.

9124
10:36:19,440 --> 10:36:21,160
Don't do that again.

9125
10:36:21,160 --> 10:36:23,120
You've literally just put me in the water,

9126
10:36:23,160 --> 10:36:26,000
and now my robes are drenched.

9127
10:36:26,000 --> 10:36:28,040
Oh, I really don't want to desync.

9128
10:36:28,040 --> 10:36:31,280
I think I still keep 100%, even if I desync,

9129
10:36:31,280 --> 10:36:34,520
from trail distance.

9130
10:36:34,520 --> 10:36:35,840
Oh, see, that's the problem.

9131
10:36:35,840 --> 10:36:38,320
They instantly throw a knife.

9132
10:36:38,320 --> 10:36:39,680
Bit of a problem.

9133
10:36:39,680 --> 10:36:41,960
Bit of a problem.

9134
10:36:41,960 --> 10:36:46,360
My goodness, they are on me.

9135
10:36:46,360 --> 10:36:48,880
Oh, that's not good.

9136
10:36:48,880 --> 10:36:51,160
Oh, that's not good.

9137
10:36:51,160 --> 10:36:52,360
I think I'm OK.

9138
10:36:53,360 --> 10:36:56,160
Oh, not good, not good, not good, not good, not good, not good.

9139
10:36:56,160 --> 10:36:59,960
If you get knocked off, they can just spam throwing knives,

9140
10:36:59,960 --> 10:37:01,960
essentially, just like what they're doing right now,

9141
10:37:01,960 --> 10:37:04,360
but I think we're OK.

9142
10:37:04,360 --> 10:37:08,560
Oh, oh, OK, we're good.

9143
10:37:08,560 --> 10:37:09,640
We're good, we're good.

9144
10:37:09,640 --> 10:37:13,200
Landed, literally landed in the water.

9145
10:37:13,200 --> 10:37:16,680
Oh, goodness me.

9146
10:37:16,680 --> 10:37:17,520
Give this to me.

9147
10:37:17,560 --> 10:37:21,520
Me, I think we're on this last section

9148
10:37:21,520 --> 10:37:25,280
of being able to be vulnerable.

9149
10:37:25,280 --> 10:37:29,280
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

9150
10:37:29,280 --> 10:37:34,480
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

9151
10:37:34,480 --> 10:37:35,680
You're going to have to attack me.

9152
10:37:35,680 --> 10:37:36,180
Ah!

9153
10:37:41,160 --> 10:37:43,880
OK, that's fine, that's fine, let me cook you.

9154
10:37:43,880 --> 10:37:46,000
Oh, see that, that's throwing knife.

9155
10:37:46,040 --> 10:37:49,480
I don't know how to counter-throw a knife if you even can.

9156
10:37:49,480 --> 10:37:51,880
Like other than, like, move a little to the left,

9157
10:37:51,880 --> 10:37:55,680
so Tanzu's ult just moved to the left five head.

9158
10:37:55,680 --> 10:37:57,800
I actually don't know if there's a counter-throw.

9159
10:38:01,080 --> 10:38:02,960
Would you like to send any more?

9160
10:38:05,920 --> 10:38:07,360
Fight me yourself.

9161
10:38:07,360 --> 10:38:11,160
It is you who tell the people lies.

9162
10:38:11,160 --> 10:38:13,360
Tell them lies.

9163
10:38:13,360 --> 10:38:15,760
Give me the code sheet.

9164
10:38:15,760 --> 10:38:18,040
All I will give you is death.

9165
10:38:18,040 --> 10:38:18,840
Really?

9166
10:38:18,840 --> 10:38:24,360
There's 20 dead bodies, and you think you can perish me?

9167
10:38:24,360 --> 10:38:25,560
Good luck, mate, good luck.

9168
10:38:25,560 --> 10:38:27,640
I'd like to see you try.

9169
10:38:27,640 --> 10:38:29,960
Oh, oh, OK, we doing this?

9170
10:38:29,960 --> 10:38:31,480
If you're just going to counter me,

9171
10:38:31,480 --> 10:38:34,680
you're getting kicked to death.

9172
10:38:34,680 --> 10:38:36,000
I ain't tolerating this.

9173
10:38:36,000 --> 10:38:38,080
If you won't let me stab stab you,

9174
10:38:38,080 --> 10:38:39,480
you're just getting kicked to death.

9175
10:38:39,480 --> 10:38:42,160
There is no other option.

9176
10:38:42,160 --> 10:38:43,400
I will put you in a circle, I'll

9177
10:38:43,400 --> 10:38:44,800
hoof you in the balls until you're dead.

9178
10:38:44,800 --> 10:38:47,520
Literally exploded your testes.

9179
10:38:47,520 --> 10:38:49,400
I'm sorry to even put that thought in your head.

9180
10:38:49,400 --> 10:38:51,480
I apologize.

9181
10:38:51,480 --> 10:38:53,480
There is a flag over here.

9182
10:38:53,480 --> 10:38:56,360
Do you want to know how to access it?

9183
10:38:56,360 --> 10:39:01,160
You go for a little dive, and it's that simple.

9184
10:39:01,160 --> 10:39:03,200
Why do I say it's that simple?

9185
10:39:03,200 --> 10:39:06,200
I may or may not have got that flag

9186
10:39:06,200 --> 10:39:08,520
after crying for 20 minutes.

9187
10:39:08,520 --> 10:39:12,400
I'm trying to find it, and I'm pulling my hair out.

9188
10:39:12,440 --> 10:39:15,920
I break his chances of ever having children now.

9189
10:39:15,920 --> 10:39:21,080
I believe that's all in this room.

9190
10:39:21,080 --> 10:39:25,240
I see a climbing thing up here, but I'm not sure.

9191
10:39:25,240 --> 10:39:27,080
Oh, that's how you actually progress.

9192
10:39:27,080 --> 10:39:27,920
My pardon.

9193
10:39:27,920 --> 10:39:28,920
Your pardon, I beg.

9194
10:39:32,360 --> 10:39:34,880
You used your cuttlefish powers to dive.

9195
10:39:34,880 --> 10:39:37,160
Yeah.

9196
10:39:37,160 --> 10:39:39,000
I cast mulch.

9197
10:39:39,040 --> 10:39:43,600
I think mulch is still my favorite cast.

9198
10:39:43,600 --> 10:39:46,080
I don't know if there's anything that beats it at the moment.

9199
10:39:54,000 --> 10:39:55,960
We are now four of six.

9200
10:39:55,960 --> 10:39:58,160
We are very close to unlocking the armor.

9201
10:39:58,160 --> 10:39:59,040
What are we looking at?

9202
10:39:59,040 --> 10:40:02,960
Oh, the clock is ticking for this mod.

9203
10:40:02,960 --> 10:40:04,320
I shouldn't have looked at the time.

9204
10:40:09,360 --> 10:40:10,640
I'm getting nervous.

9205
10:40:10,640 --> 10:40:12,600
I don't want to get too close to the hell forever.

9206
10:40:12,600 --> 10:40:16,280
I don't want it to explode in a fire for my vod.

9207
10:40:20,160 --> 10:40:24,400
Nice money for doing the side quests.

9208
10:40:24,400 --> 10:40:30,400
We're at 49 Florence, so we can probably invest in some,

9209
10:40:30,400 --> 10:40:33,960
how you call, tourist attractions.

9210
10:40:33,960 --> 10:40:35,840
I can't remember what their official name is.

9211
10:40:35,840 --> 10:40:37,960
I think they just get named by what they actually are,

9212
10:40:37,960 --> 10:40:46,080
because they are from the Oracle buildings and locations.

9213
10:40:46,080 --> 10:40:47,880
I can't remember even.

9214
10:40:47,880 --> 10:40:52,120
My cast is still streaming strong, hey, yeah.

9215
10:40:52,120 --> 10:40:53,600
So I was like, go to bed.

9216
10:40:53,600 --> 10:40:55,680
Oh, don't you worry.

9217
10:40:55,680 --> 10:40:57,680
Oh, shit.

9218
10:40:57,680 --> 10:40:58,920
That's just inhaled my spit.

9219
10:41:08,920 --> 10:41:09,880
Pardon me.

9220
10:41:09,880 --> 10:41:12,520
I didn't mean to cough.

9221
10:41:12,520 --> 10:41:15,080
OK, Romulai, Romulai, Romulai.

9222
10:41:18,080 --> 10:41:18,720
Can I see it?

9223
10:41:21,560 --> 10:41:22,480
There's one here.

9224
10:41:22,480 --> 10:41:23,680
That's quite far away, though.

9225
10:41:26,240 --> 10:41:28,320
Oh, there's one in the Colosseum.

9226
10:41:28,320 --> 10:41:29,080
I never saw that.

9227
10:41:29,080 --> 10:41:30,560
OK, we're going to do this one up here.

9228
10:41:33,760 --> 10:41:36,680
Obviously, your successor is going to still go in.

9229
10:41:36,680 --> 10:41:41,800
You never met a girl with such stamina before, huh?

9230
10:41:41,800 --> 10:41:43,600
It's a pleasure to be your first.

9231
10:41:43,600 --> 10:41:46,320
I can't set the bow.

9232
10:41:46,320 --> 10:41:49,160
I wasn't kidding when I said I'm an endurance streamer.

9233
10:41:49,160 --> 10:41:52,920
As long as my voice doesn't crack and I lose it,

9234
10:41:52,920 --> 10:41:54,480
I'm happy to stream long.

9235
10:41:54,480 --> 10:41:57,440
No, obviously, it does depend on the game.

9236
10:41:57,440 --> 10:41:59,840
If it's a game I don't like, then, yeah,

9237
10:41:59,840 --> 10:42:02,840
definitely do not expect me to be on 12 hours for the game.

9238
10:42:02,840 --> 10:42:05,680
But yeah.

9239
10:42:05,720 --> 10:42:07,320
What's that supposed to mean?

9240
10:42:10,080 --> 10:42:12,640
This is the longest a streamer has lasted for me.

9241
10:42:12,640 --> 10:42:13,920
Wait, seriously?

9242
10:42:13,920 --> 10:42:17,320
I'm breaking your first-time records?

9243
10:42:20,080 --> 10:42:20,560
Will?

9244
10:42:23,760 --> 10:42:24,720
I love long streams.

9245
10:42:24,720 --> 10:42:25,320
It's so nice.

9246
10:42:25,320 --> 10:42:27,000
Ah, I'm glad I can keep you company.

9247
10:42:27,000 --> 10:42:29,160
Whether you're at work or you're bing-chinging, don't show

9248
10:42:29,160 --> 10:42:29,800
me.

9249
10:42:29,800 --> 10:42:31,880
Bing-chinging.

9250
10:42:31,880 --> 10:42:35,480
I'm glad I can keep you company.

9251
10:42:35,520 --> 10:42:37,840
My record is like a one and a half.

9252
10:42:37,840 --> 10:42:40,840
Wait, of someone streaming?

9253
10:42:40,840 --> 10:42:41,800
No.

9254
10:42:41,800 --> 10:42:43,880
You mean how long you've watched a streamer

9255
10:42:43,880 --> 10:42:46,800
when you say that?

9256
10:42:46,800 --> 10:42:49,600
I mean, have you ever watched a streamer that's

9257
10:42:49,600 --> 10:42:54,200
streamed more than like, what's the average stream time

9258
10:42:54,200 --> 10:42:56,440
for a VTuber?

9259
10:42:56,440 --> 10:42:59,280
Oh, that would be an interesting statistic.

9260
10:42:59,360 --> 10:43:06,880
Average stream time for a VTuber is three hours?

9261
10:43:06,880 --> 10:43:07,880
Two hours?

9262
10:43:11,160 --> 10:43:13,520
I called in sick to have time to watch streams and catch up

9263
10:43:13,520 --> 10:43:15,120
and go, stop.

9264
10:43:15,120 --> 10:43:17,320
You're going to get in trouble doing that.

9265
10:43:17,320 --> 10:43:20,920
You can't do that.

9266
10:43:20,920 --> 10:43:23,360
Don't get yourself in trouble at work.

9267
10:43:26,080 --> 10:43:27,800
The votes are always here.

9268
10:43:27,800 --> 10:43:33,040
And I plan on streaming for a long time.

9269
10:43:33,040 --> 10:43:36,360
My biggest concern, I'm happy to talk about this concern.

9270
10:43:36,360 --> 10:43:40,440
My biggest concern with streaming was I wouldn't have

9271
10:43:40,440 --> 10:43:44,640
time to stream and technically manage.

9272
10:43:44,640 --> 10:43:50,840
But I've managed to get a script manager in place, which

9273
10:43:50,840 --> 10:43:55,200
means that my only responsibilities are

9274
10:43:55,200 --> 10:43:57,840
streaming for myself and arranging

9275
10:43:57,840 --> 10:44:02,480
shorts for the girls to make, like,

9276
10:44:02,480 --> 10:44:04,800
Mercy's shorts that have been coming out.

9277
10:44:04,800 --> 10:44:07,760
I scripted them and got her to say them.

9278
10:44:07,760 --> 10:44:12,320
And I don't know if you enjoyed her blonde one.

9279
10:44:12,320 --> 10:44:15,320
Obviously, Mercy couldn't suggest talking

9280
10:44:15,320 --> 10:44:17,360
about behind the scenes content.

9281
10:44:17,360 --> 10:44:21,080
I gave her the script, she made it.

9282
10:44:21,080 --> 10:44:22,920
And then I got someone to edit it type thing.

9283
10:44:22,920 --> 10:44:25,080
That's my only responsibility is, like,

9284
10:44:25,080 --> 10:44:27,680
organizing clips, basically, that go up in the girls'

9285
10:44:27,680 --> 10:44:30,400
channels, because I didn't want them to feel stressed out

9286
10:44:30,400 --> 10:44:32,400
dealing with that kind of stuff.

9287
10:44:32,400 --> 10:44:43,040
The only problem is I'm facing the issue of clipped parts

9288
10:44:43,040 --> 10:44:46,480
of stream turning into shorts.

9289
10:44:46,480 --> 10:44:50,320
Because obviously, I don't have time to scrub through

9290
10:44:50,320 --> 10:44:53,800
their content in order to find, like, a funny thing.

9291
10:44:53,800 --> 10:44:59,040
So when you clip a girl's, one of the girls' streams, on the

9292
10:44:59,040 --> 10:45:01,880
account, I can see what people have clipped.

9293
10:45:01,880 --> 10:45:03,920
And then I can send that to an editor.

9294
10:45:03,920 --> 10:45:08,000
So don't be afraid to clip something you like.

9295
10:45:08,000 --> 10:45:10,400
Because on my end, I can see that.

9296
10:45:10,400 --> 10:45:13,560
And then I can send it on to an actual creator of the

9297
10:45:13,560 --> 10:45:16,360
clips, like, for a short.

9298
10:45:16,360 --> 10:45:17,920
Did you see that?

9299
10:45:17,920 --> 10:45:21,480
So I can get away with that stuff.

9300
10:45:21,480 --> 10:45:22,960
Yeah, that's the only thing.

9301
10:45:22,960 --> 10:45:27,360
I think your personal best is back-to-back 12-hour of odds.

9302
10:45:27,360 --> 10:45:29,880
Yes.

9303
10:45:29,880 --> 10:45:35,080
We're probably going to do it again when the DLC comes out.

9304
10:45:35,080 --> 10:45:38,120
I'm not sure if we'll do the Butt-Bump adventure for that

9305
10:45:38,120 --> 10:45:41,400
part, though.

9306
10:45:41,400 --> 10:45:42,080
I know it.

9307
10:45:42,080 --> 10:45:43,520
Wait, what was my 100%?

9308
10:45:43,520 --> 10:45:44,680
I wasn't paying.

9309
10:45:45,440 --> 10:45:47,480
Not another timed one.

9310
10:45:47,480 --> 10:45:49,360
Stinky.

9311
10:45:49,360 --> 10:45:50,640
I'm not going to rush it.

9312
10:45:50,640 --> 10:45:54,000
I'm just going to go through it, so I know what we're

9313
10:45:54,000 --> 10:45:55,000
looking at.

9314
10:45:58,320 --> 10:46:00,640
Ooh, I remember this one.

9315
10:46:00,640 --> 10:46:04,960
I have desynced DLC, downloadable content.

9316
10:46:04,960 --> 10:46:10,240
The video game Elden Ring has official DLC coming out on

9317
10:46:10,240 --> 10:46:13,000
June 19, I believe.

9318
10:46:13,000 --> 10:46:16,960
And I plan on doing it multiplayer with you guys, so

9319
10:46:16,960 --> 10:46:20,880
I will put down marks where, what the heck?

9320
10:46:20,880 --> 10:46:22,360
What am I supposed to do?

9321
10:46:25,640 --> 10:46:30,160
Unfortunately, I desync a lot in this.

9322
10:46:30,160 --> 10:46:34,280
So I apologize if you're expecting perfect gameplay.

9323
10:46:34,280 --> 10:46:35,520
It is not possible with me.

9324
10:46:38,680 --> 10:46:40,200
I just realized what DLC means.

9325
10:46:40,200 --> 10:46:42,200
It's downloadable.

9326
10:46:42,200 --> 10:46:44,280
Wait, no.

9327
10:46:44,280 --> 10:46:47,040
Downloadable content?

9328
10:46:47,040 --> 10:46:48,640
Wait, that's not what DLC means.

9329
10:46:55,920 --> 10:46:56,680
Yeah.

9330
10:46:56,680 --> 10:46:57,720
OK, it does.

9331
10:46:57,720 --> 10:46:59,720
I was like, second guess, because I was like,

9332
10:46:59,720 --> 10:47:01,520
demo mode is one word.

9333
10:47:01,520 --> 10:47:03,920
But maybe back then, it was two words.

9334
10:47:13,200 --> 10:47:17,160
Stop moving around, ya bam.

9335
10:47:17,160 --> 10:47:18,960
He just sold spells.

9336
10:47:18,960 --> 10:47:20,760
It's been a pleasure, but I finally reached the end of

9337
10:47:20,760 --> 10:47:22,400
my endurance.

9338
10:47:22,400 --> 10:47:23,280
Not by my choice.

9339
10:47:23,280 --> 10:47:24,640
Can't be short on my sleep before work.

9340
10:47:24,640 --> 10:47:25,880
Yes, please rest well.

9341
10:47:25,880 --> 10:47:28,320
If you guys have work, if you guys have responsibilities,

9342
10:47:28,320 --> 10:47:30,960
please do not sacrifice your sleep or your

9343
10:47:30,960 --> 10:47:33,080
responsibilities to watch me.

9344
10:47:33,080 --> 10:47:36,080
I will be streaming all the hecking time.

9345
10:47:36,080 --> 10:47:40,200
And there will be plenty of VOD content to watch.

9346
10:47:40,200 --> 10:47:43,440
What?

9347
10:47:43,440 --> 10:47:46,800
That was like two seconds.

9348
10:47:46,800 --> 10:47:49,000
That was so quick.

9349
10:47:49,000 --> 10:47:51,400
That was unbelievably quick.

9350
10:47:51,400 --> 10:47:54,600
You know how earlier I quoted and said, this game is so

9351
10:47:54,600 --> 10:47:56,040
forgiving?

9352
10:47:56,040 --> 10:47:58,920
Wow.

9353
10:47:58,920 --> 10:48:02,880
That was like instant red bar pool.

9354
10:48:02,880 --> 10:48:06,760
I did not expect that.

9355
10:48:06,760 --> 10:48:08,720
I apologize.

9356
10:48:08,720 --> 10:48:10,680
I don't know how I was going to make that happen.

9357
10:48:10,680 --> 10:48:12,520
First time watching the stream for this long stamina

9358
10:48:12,520 --> 10:48:14,840
queen, I kneel, but I have to hit the bed.

9359
10:48:14,840 --> 10:48:15,720
Please rest.

9360
10:48:15,720 --> 10:48:17,320
Good night to those who sleep.

9361
10:48:17,320 --> 10:48:21,080
Goodbye to those who have a few things to do.

9362
10:48:21,080 --> 10:48:23,480
And get done.

9363
10:48:23,480 --> 10:48:24,560
Yeah.

9364
10:48:24,560 --> 10:48:28,120
Don't feel bad that you have to go do your thing.

9365
10:48:28,120 --> 10:48:31,920
Whoa, no, my controller died.

9366
10:48:31,920 --> 10:48:34,680
Oh, I can't play mouse and keyboard.

9367
10:48:34,680 --> 10:48:37,560
Oh, it's not even registered in mouse and keyboard anyway.

9368
10:48:37,600 --> 10:48:40,000
I'm going to have to go get my freaking charger.

9369
10:48:40,000 --> 10:48:42,480
Wait, is this a charger?

9370
10:48:42,480 --> 10:48:46,880
Oh, you spin me right round, baby, right round.

9371
10:48:46,880 --> 10:48:50,880
When you go down, when you go down now.

9372
10:48:50,880 --> 10:48:57,440
You spin my head round, round, round, round, round.

9373
10:48:57,440 --> 10:48:58,640
Is there a charger?

9374
10:48:58,640 --> 10:49:00,280
Hold on, I'm going for my cables.

9375
10:49:00,280 --> 10:49:02,200
We are going to desync because of distance.

9376
10:49:02,200 --> 10:49:05,080
I don't even think I have my charging cable in this dying

9377
10:49:05,080 --> 10:49:07,320
room.

9378
10:49:07,360 --> 10:49:09,440
Oh, I am so sorry.

9379
10:49:09,440 --> 10:49:11,600
I'm going to have to like back out and go quickly,

9380
10:49:11,600 --> 10:49:12,840
go get our charging cable.

9381
10:49:12,840 --> 10:49:14,760
I'm so sorry, but BRB, I'll be a second.

9382
10:49:37,320 --> 10:50:04,320
I can't believe I've played so long and drained my battery.

9383
10:50:04,320 --> 10:50:05,240
Oh, no.

9384
10:50:05,240 --> 10:50:08,040
Wait, what's that for?

9385
10:50:08,040 --> 10:50:10,840
What's that wire for?

9386
10:50:10,840 --> 10:50:11,320
Sugar.

9387
10:50:14,560 --> 10:50:17,200
Sugar, spice, and everything knife.

9388
10:50:17,200 --> 10:50:20,720
My headset is the front panel.

9389
10:50:20,720 --> 10:50:23,360
And the second USB port is taken up by the controller.

9390
10:50:23,360 --> 10:50:26,000
Hold on, hold on, let me get on my hands and knees.

9391
10:50:26,000 --> 10:50:26,960
Can I stop myself?

9392
10:50:26,960 --> 10:50:28,520
Can I?

9393
10:50:28,520 --> 10:50:31,440
Is there even a port back here?

9394
10:50:31,440 --> 10:50:33,560
Hello, is there a free port?

9395
10:50:33,560 --> 10:50:36,880
I don't think there's a free port.

9396
10:50:36,880 --> 10:50:37,880
Wow.

9397
10:50:37,880 --> 10:50:44,560
Um, do I need some light for face tracking?

9398
10:50:44,560 --> 10:50:47,240
I don't think so.

9399
10:50:47,240 --> 10:50:49,440
Goodness me.

9400
10:50:49,440 --> 10:50:52,000
I actually ran out of USB ports.

9401
10:50:52,000 --> 10:50:59,680
OK, um, wait, no, I'm very dumb.

9402
10:50:59,680 --> 10:51:05,520
I do not need the Bluetooth, the Bluetooth device is connected.

9403
10:51:05,520 --> 10:51:08,840
I don't need the Bluetooth bit because I will have the controller

9404
10:51:08,840 --> 10:51:11,680
plugged straight into the PC for charging purposes.

9405
10:51:11,680 --> 10:51:13,600
Yes, I figured it out.

9406
10:51:13,600 --> 10:51:16,240
One second.

9407
10:51:16,240 --> 10:51:19,280
Well, I apologize for the unprofessionalism.

9408
10:51:19,280 --> 10:51:21,520
However, I fixed the problem.

9409
10:51:21,520 --> 10:51:24,560
Thus, I am a trust me, I'm an engineer.

9410
10:51:24,560 --> 10:51:26,280
What the heck just happened here?

9411
10:51:26,280 --> 10:51:30,920
Because trust me, I'm an engineer.

9412
10:51:30,920 --> 10:51:32,880
I'm a very, very smart beat.

9413
10:51:32,880 --> 10:51:34,280
Yay.

9414
10:51:34,280 --> 10:51:35,680
Oh, have I desynced?

9415
10:51:35,680 --> 10:51:38,120
Oh, oh, I desynced because I was out of range.

9416
10:51:38,120 --> 10:51:40,080
That was a mistake on my part.

9417
10:51:40,080 --> 10:51:41,000
Whoopsie daisy.

9418
10:51:41,000 --> 10:51:44,480
OK, we'll try again.

9419
10:51:44,480 --> 10:51:46,040
The all the holes are filled.

9420
10:51:46,040 --> 10:51:48,120
Hey, yo.

9421
10:51:48,120 --> 10:51:51,640
How do you run out of USB ports in this day and age?

9422
10:51:51,640 --> 10:51:54,400
Nicola, wait, where am I going?

9423
10:51:54,400 --> 10:51:57,640
OK, let's hopefully not desync this time.

9424
10:51:57,640 --> 10:52:00,040
Because that was so aggressive, though.

9425
10:52:00,040 --> 10:52:02,640
I'm wondering if that should have been patched.

9426
10:52:02,640 --> 10:52:07,840
But because it was a layer of Romulus,

9427
10:52:07,840 --> 10:52:11,440
like not a lot of playtesters got through this part.

9428
10:52:11,440 --> 10:52:15,760
Because it was like the later content, like not main.

9429
10:52:15,760 --> 10:52:20,040
So that'd be interesting.

9430
10:52:20,040 --> 10:52:21,600
OK.

9431
10:52:21,600 --> 10:52:24,480
Got the gold.

9432
10:52:24,480 --> 10:52:26,440
I see you.

9433
10:52:26,440 --> 10:52:31,600
I'm just an average man with an average life.

9434
10:52:31,600 --> 10:52:32,560
Wait, where is it?

9435
10:52:32,560 --> 10:52:34,280
Lost him already.

9436
10:52:34,280 --> 10:52:35,960
Go in here.

9437
10:52:35,960 --> 10:52:38,920
Please don't desync, because that was so fast.

9438
10:52:43,360 --> 10:52:45,320
It's giving one thrust is all it took.

9439
10:52:45,920 --> 10:52:51,760
Oh, I'm not hiding.

9440
10:52:51,760 --> 10:52:52,760
I'm not hiding.

9441
10:52:52,760 --> 10:52:54,200
OK, I'm hiding now.

9442
10:52:54,200 --> 10:52:56,840
Don't do that again.

9443
10:52:56,840 --> 10:52:58,000
You're scaring me.

9444
10:52:58,000 --> 10:53:01,320
I think he goes over there.

9445
10:53:01,320 --> 10:53:05,320
I'm wondering if I should beat him before he moves.

9446
10:53:05,320 --> 10:53:07,280
Like this?

9447
10:53:07,280 --> 10:53:10,600
I think he goes through that gate right there, dead ahead.

9448
10:53:10,600 --> 10:53:11,640
So I'm.

9449
10:53:11,640 --> 10:53:12,440
Oh, no.

9450
10:53:16,120 --> 10:53:16,880
Distance.

9451
10:53:16,880 --> 10:53:19,920
He's not that far away from me.

9452
10:53:19,920 --> 10:53:20,920
I need to get back to work.

9453
10:53:20,920 --> 10:53:21,680
Have fun at work.

9454
10:53:25,680 --> 10:53:27,800
Please don't worry.

9455
10:53:27,800 --> 10:53:29,800
Veal, what's their hard work in?

9456
10:53:29,800 --> 10:53:30,920
Heck yeah.

9457
10:53:30,920 --> 10:53:33,240
And you know what they get?

9458
10:53:33,240 --> 10:53:33,720
Nothing.

9459
10:53:33,720 --> 10:53:38,360
I actually feel really bad about that.

9460
10:53:38,360 --> 10:53:40,160
Feels bad, man.

9461
10:53:40,160 --> 10:53:40,660
Ah!

9462
10:53:41,660 --> 10:53:43,660
Ah!

9463
10:53:43,660 --> 10:53:47,380
Ah, that was not fun.

9464
10:53:47,380 --> 10:53:49,140
Don't turn around again.

9465
10:53:49,140 --> 10:53:52,420
Do I make myself clear?

9466
10:53:52,420 --> 10:53:54,700
Yes, ma'am.

9467
10:53:54,700 --> 10:53:56,700
OK, easy, easy.

9468
10:53:56,700 --> 10:54:00,900
Take it easy, easy, easy, easy.

9469
10:54:00,900 --> 10:54:03,940
Bit closer, bit closer, bit closer.

9470
10:54:03,940 --> 10:54:05,180
He doesn't know.

9471
10:54:05,180 --> 10:54:06,980
Chat, he doesn't know.

9472
10:54:06,980 --> 10:54:07,580
He doesn't know.

9473
10:54:07,580 --> 10:54:08,180
He doesn't know.

9474
10:54:08,180 --> 10:54:08,780
He doesn't know.

9475
10:54:08,780 --> 10:54:09,460
He doesn't know.

9476
10:54:09,460 --> 10:54:11,860
He doesn't know.

9477
10:54:11,860 --> 10:54:13,580
So what hurts him?

9478
10:54:13,580 --> 10:54:15,100
He doesn't know.

9479
10:54:15,100 --> 10:54:17,700
Wait, what he doesn't know doesn't hurt him.

9480
10:54:17,700 --> 10:54:18,980
Yeah.

9481
10:54:18,980 --> 10:54:19,500
Good night.

9482
10:54:19,500 --> 10:54:19,980
Rest well.

9483
10:54:19,980 --> 10:54:23,140
All of those who have to go, please sleep well.

9484
10:54:23,140 --> 10:54:27,380
Make sure you deliver them convincingly with passion.

9485
10:54:27,380 --> 10:54:30,380
My passion.

9486
10:54:30,380 --> 10:54:34,420
Hey, hey, doofus, you're having a sad son following you.

9487
10:54:34,420 --> 10:54:36,100
Does he now?

9488
10:54:36,100 --> 10:54:37,060
They don't now.

9489
10:54:37,060 --> 10:54:38,700
Do you have the key?

9490
10:54:38,700 --> 10:54:40,300
Yes, ma'am.

9491
10:54:40,300 --> 10:54:41,460
Ma'am.

9492
10:54:41,460 --> 10:54:44,740
May the Lord be with you.

9493
10:54:44,740 --> 10:54:47,660
And also with you, ma'am.

9494
10:54:47,660 --> 10:54:49,780
I have a callus out.

9495
10:54:49,780 --> 10:54:52,140
He is five.

9496
10:54:52,140 --> 10:54:54,220
Remember the passion.

9497
10:54:54,220 --> 10:54:56,140
Passion for passion.

9498
10:54:56,140 --> 10:54:59,180
Right, I believe we can get caught now.

9499
10:54:59,180 --> 10:55:00,060
Oh, god.

9500
10:55:00,060 --> 10:55:00,820
You can't hear me.

9501
10:55:00,820 --> 10:55:03,740
He has air pods in.

9502
10:55:03,740 --> 10:55:04,240
Ah!

9503
10:55:04,240 --> 10:55:07,820
Asasino, you will not get me.

9504
10:55:07,820 --> 10:55:09,540
So this is the funniest thing ever.

9505
10:55:09,540 --> 10:55:15,380
He's in full gown and all of that.

9506
10:55:15,380 --> 10:55:18,220
And he's so agile.

9507
10:55:18,220 --> 10:55:21,060
And I'm not being funny, but if you've ever

9508
10:55:21,060 --> 10:55:24,260
worn a skirt before, it is so restrictive.

9509
10:55:24,260 --> 10:55:28,060
I think I've worn a skirt twice in my damn life.

9510
10:55:28,060 --> 10:55:30,300
Oh, there's jewelry down there.

9511
10:55:30,300 --> 10:55:31,980
Not jewelry.

9512
10:55:31,980 --> 10:55:33,340
Trita.

9513
10:55:33,340 --> 10:55:35,700
A bit of Trita.

9514
10:55:35,700 --> 10:55:37,980
These are one of the chase sequences

9515
10:55:37,980 --> 10:55:40,620
where he doesn't actually get out of range of view.

9516
10:55:40,620 --> 10:55:42,660
I'm like 99% sure.

9517
10:55:42,660 --> 10:55:47,700
He actually holds back if you're taken too long.

9518
10:55:47,700 --> 10:55:50,620
I've come out the wrong window.

9519
10:55:50,620 --> 10:55:53,460
But yeah, he actually waits for you, which is very nice of him.

9520
10:55:53,460 --> 10:55:55,900
I do appreciate when game devs do that.

9521
10:55:55,900 --> 10:55:59,580
I understand for the immersion you might want to actually

9522
10:55:59,580 --> 10:56:02,500
chase, but it's kind of nice not having your gameplay

9523
10:56:02,540 --> 10:56:08,420
interrupted because of kind of like small things like that.

9524
10:56:08,420 --> 10:56:10,260
I have to say Assassin's Creed definitely.

9525
10:56:10,260 --> 10:56:12,340
Gameplay isn't horrifically interrupted

9526
10:56:12,340 --> 10:56:18,980
if you're a bad player, which I do appreciate in video games.

9527
10:56:18,980 --> 10:56:20,180
Oh my god.

9528
10:56:20,180 --> 10:56:23,180
He said, no room at the inn.

9529
10:56:23,180 --> 10:56:25,860
Mother Mary.

9530
10:56:25,860 --> 10:56:28,460
No, little donkey.

9531
10:56:28,460 --> 10:56:34,780
Carrie Mary, then the dusty road.

9532
10:56:34,780 --> 10:56:38,260
I can't believe I've got the ninth sanctuary in a church.

9533
10:56:38,260 --> 10:56:44,660
Did you know that if you went to a church

9534
10:56:44,660 --> 10:56:46,700
and you were like a wanted criminal,

9535
10:56:46,700 --> 10:56:50,060
if you cleaned sanctuary, they couldn't get you back

9536
10:56:50,060 --> 10:56:52,900
in the old days.

9537
10:56:52,900 --> 10:56:56,700
But now, if you're a criminal and want to get away with it,

9538
10:56:56,740 --> 10:57:01,540
you just have to be super rich or no.

9539
10:57:01,540 --> 10:57:05,460
And have blackmail on them, that's pretty much it.

9540
10:57:05,460 --> 10:57:07,460
Sorry, I don't.

9541
10:57:07,460 --> 10:57:09,020
Wait, wait, that was supposed to happen.

9542
10:57:09,020 --> 10:57:10,500
OK, that was supposed to happen.

9543
10:57:10,500 --> 10:57:12,180
I was supposed to split.

9544
10:57:12,180 --> 10:57:15,460
I was like, oh, no, the camera angle's

9545
10:57:15,460 --> 10:57:18,060
a bit funky for claiming.

9546
10:57:18,060 --> 10:57:19,580
Oh, I don't like that.

9547
10:57:19,580 --> 10:57:23,860
Ew, ew, ew, ew, ew, ew, ew, ew, ew, ew, ew.

9548
10:57:23,860 --> 10:57:24,780
The key camera angle.

9549
10:57:28,460 --> 10:57:31,540
He is so agile for this old man pope.

9550
10:57:31,540 --> 10:57:34,780
Are you sure you aren't in the fast on yourself?

9551
10:57:34,780 --> 10:57:36,500
Well, this is getting a bit ridiculous, me.

9552
10:57:36,500 --> 10:57:38,060
I'm going to, me.

9553
10:57:38,060 --> 10:57:41,260
This is getting, I don't know what they are putting in your food,

9554
10:57:41,260 --> 10:57:44,940
like what they're blessing the holy bread with.

9555
10:57:44,940 --> 10:57:51,980
How on earth are you achieving any of these stunts?

9556
10:57:52,020 --> 10:57:53,500
My goodness, what is in that wine?

9557
10:58:01,500 --> 10:58:02,900
Oh, I'm confused.

9558
10:58:02,900 --> 10:58:04,580
Where am I supposed to go?

9559
10:58:04,580 --> 10:58:05,420
Oh, no, I missed it.

9560
10:58:05,420 --> 10:58:05,940
Oh, it's the light.

9561
10:58:05,940 --> 10:58:07,340
I'm sorry, it's the light.

9562
10:58:07,340 --> 10:58:09,860
Literally, rule one, follow the light.

9563
10:58:09,860 --> 10:58:11,020
And I couldn't even do that.

9564
10:58:11,020 --> 10:58:11,900
Where the heck am I going?

9565
10:58:11,900 --> 10:58:14,580
Oh, I'm getting so confused and turned around now.

9566
10:58:14,580 --> 10:58:19,020
Oh dear, oh dear, oh dear, oh dear, oh dear, oh dear.

9567
10:58:19,020 --> 10:58:20,460
Oh dear, oh dear, oh dear.

9568
10:58:20,460 --> 10:58:21,940
Right, there we go.

9569
10:58:22,900 --> 10:58:23,400
Watch me.

9570
10:58:26,780 --> 10:58:29,860
I didn't even recall him doing that.

9571
10:58:29,860 --> 10:58:30,860
Where the heck am I going?

9572
10:58:37,700 --> 10:58:40,460
OK.

9573
10:58:40,460 --> 10:58:41,940
We've done it.

9574
10:58:41,940 --> 10:58:45,460
We've done it.

9575
10:58:45,460 --> 10:58:49,660
I can't wait to be rich to get away with things.

9576
10:58:49,700 --> 10:58:52,580
What on earth are you even for?

9577
10:58:52,580 --> 10:58:55,140
There's no order at all.

9578
10:58:55,140 --> 10:59:00,460
Oh, is this he's going to counter me?

9579
10:59:00,460 --> 10:59:03,780
Hey, right, you know what time it is, time for?

9580
10:59:03,780 --> 10:59:05,340
You don't need this, anyway.

9581
10:59:05,340 --> 10:59:09,020
You're devoted to God, so you don't even need this.

9582
10:59:09,020 --> 10:59:10,940
I'm doing you a favor.

9583
10:59:10,940 --> 10:59:13,460
And I'm probably, no, I'm not going to make the jokers

9584
10:59:13,460 --> 10:59:15,460
too obvious.

9585
10:59:15,460 --> 10:59:19,380
Da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da.

9586
10:59:19,380 --> 10:59:21,980
Can I push him over the edge?

9587
10:59:21,980 --> 10:59:24,480
Push.

9588
10:59:24,480 --> 10:59:25,980
You saved me.

9589
10:59:25,980 --> 10:59:26,980
Oh, my god.

9590
10:59:30,980 --> 10:59:31,480
Oh.

9591
10:59:35,340 --> 10:59:38,220
I must have subconsciously known

9592
10:59:38,220 --> 10:59:43,460
that you could push him off the edge,

9593
10:59:43,460 --> 10:59:45,780
because how on earth did I remember that?

9594
10:59:50,380 --> 10:59:51,780
Oh, my goodness.

9595
10:59:56,780 --> 10:59:58,580
That must be main story.

9596
10:59:58,580 --> 11:00:00,780
You must always push him off the end or something,

9597
11:00:00,780 --> 11:00:03,180
because there's no way I would have thought of that myself.

9598
11:00:03,180 --> 11:00:04,780
I must have done it before in the past.

9599
11:00:04,780 --> 11:00:08,580
I don't remember much of Romuli, because I don't do it.

9600
11:00:08,580 --> 11:00:12,980
When I replay the game, I'm actually anonymous.

9601
11:00:12,980 --> 11:00:15,980
I am wired in.

9602
11:00:20,380 --> 11:00:23,380
Wait, did I do that in time?

9603
11:00:23,380 --> 11:00:25,380
Is that 100% that?

9604
11:00:25,380 --> 11:00:27,380
Did you hear about this?

9605
11:00:27,380 --> 11:00:29,380
Did you see this news?

9606
11:00:29,380 --> 11:00:30,380
I did!

9607
11:00:30,380 --> 11:00:32,380
Okay, we don't have to do that.

9608
11:00:32,380 --> 11:00:34,380
Are you sadistic?

9609
11:00:36,380 --> 11:00:38,380
Yeah, I'm like, how would I have known that?

9610
11:00:38,380 --> 11:00:42,380
But it must always happen plausibly.

9611
11:00:44,380 --> 11:00:45,380
Easy clip.

9612
11:00:45,380 --> 11:00:48,380
We've got one more layer to go.

9613
11:00:51,380 --> 11:00:53,380
Catching a flight.

9614
11:00:53,380 --> 11:00:55,380
Safe travels, Landstrider.

9615
11:00:56,380 --> 11:00:57,380
Thanks for hanging.

9616
11:00:58,380 --> 11:01:01,380
New outfit unlocked in the inventory menu.

9617
11:01:01,380 --> 11:01:05,380
No, I haven't done anything to earn that, so that's not correct.

9618
11:01:05,380 --> 11:01:08,380
Okay, the next location is Il Colosseo.

9619
11:01:09,380 --> 11:01:11,380
I'm just going to check.

9620
11:01:11,380 --> 11:01:14,380
I think my takeaway got delivered.

9621
11:01:14,380 --> 11:01:18,380
So if you just give me one second, we are going to go to the Il Colosseum,

9622
11:01:18,380 --> 11:01:23,380
and we are going to do the last layer of Romuli and unlock the armor.

9623
11:01:23,380 --> 11:01:25,380
The armor looks pretty cool.

9624
11:01:25,380 --> 11:01:29,380
You can see my health bars now, how I haven't invested in any armor at all.

9625
11:01:29,380 --> 11:01:34,380
Once we get the armor of Romuli.

9626
11:01:34,380 --> 11:01:36,380
Yeah, you're going like it.

9627
11:01:37,380 --> 11:01:39,380
Give me one second just to check.

9628
11:01:39,380 --> 11:01:41,380
I think it has been delivered.

9629
11:01:44,380 --> 11:01:46,380
Let's go.

9630
11:02:14,380 --> 11:02:15,380
Let's go.

9631
11:02:44,380 --> 11:02:45,380
Let's go.

9632
11:02:45,380 --> 11:02:46,380
Let's go.

9633
11:02:46,380 --> 11:02:47,380
Let's go.

9634
11:03:12,380 --> 11:03:15,380
Guess which fat bastard got a takeaway?

9635
11:03:15,380 --> 11:03:16,380
Give me.

9636
11:03:19,380 --> 11:03:24,380
I have a spicy chicken burger in chip and sprite.

9637
11:03:24,380 --> 11:03:25,380
That's what I got.

9638
11:03:29,380 --> 11:03:31,380
I'm going to take more drinks of water though.

9639
11:03:34,380 --> 11:03:37,380
But we're definitely going to get the armor.

9640
11:03:37,380 --> 11:03:40,380
I don't know if we're going to get anything else, unfortunately.

9641
11:03:40,380 --> 11:03:45,380
I'm going to eat it now because I don't know if you have this problem

9642
11:03:45,380 --> 11:03:51,380
with delivery where you're from, but the driver hangs about at the restaurant

9643
11:03:51,380 --> 11:03:55,380
to try and get a double order, and then the food arrives cold

9644
11:03:55,380 --> 11:03:58,380
because they've waited so long to try and get a double order.

9645
11:04:00,380 --> 11:04:03,380
And it's so annoying, like it happens all the time.

9646
11:04:04,380 --> 11:04:10,380
And yeah, I'm like 99% sure it's happened

9647
11:04:10,380 --> 11:04:15,380
because that took so long from the last break I had to get here.

9648
11:04:19,380 --> 11:04:20,380
That happens to you too.

9649
11:04:20,380 --> 11:04:25,380
Okay, I've got chicken burger, spicy chicken burger and chips,

9650
11:04:25,380 --> 11:04:27,380
and I've got sprite.

9651
11:04:28,380 --> 11:04:30,380
Or my fizzy juice.

9652
11:04:32,380 --> 11:04:35,380
They added the prioritise option.

9653
11:04:35,380 --> 11:04:40,380
What, instead of just getting actually telling the drivers to deliver the food hot?

9654
11:04:41,380 --> 11:04:44,380
That's pretty ridiculous, honestly.

9655
11:04:48,380 --> 11:04:50,380
And hanging around.

9656
11:04:53,380 --> 11:04:56,380
Sorry for those of you who don't like eating.

9657
11:04:57,380 --> 11:05:00,380
I've been streaming for 11 hours and I need to refuel,

9658
11:05:00,380 --> 11:05:02,380
and this is my food before bed.

9659
11:05:02,380 --> 11:05:04,380
Literally, I'm going to brush my teeth.

9660
11:05:04,380 --> 11:05:07,380
I'm going to check the girls are okay on the discord.

9661
11:05:07,380 --> 11:05:10,380
And if all is good, then bedtime for me.

9662
11:05:13,380 --> 11:05:18,380
I was up around two hours, no, four hours before stream.

9663
11:05:19,380 --> 11:05:27,380
And then I managed to speak to Mimosa from Yumi Plus about the ASMR.

9664
11:05:27,380 --> 11:05:30,380
But that was like one hour before stream,

9665
11:05:30,380 --> 11:05:33,380
and then I had to send Clippers some stuff for the girls.

9666
11:05:36,380 --> 11:05:38,380
But things are settling down, they're calming down.

9667
11:05:38,380 --> 11:05:41,380
It's a bit chaotic, but you lead.

9668
11:05:48,380 --> 11:05:51,380
A little bit busy, but it's going to calm down.

9669
11:05:51,380 --> 11:05:54,380
And especially when the script manager comes into play,

9670
11:05:54,380 --> 11:05:56,380
I literally don't have to do anything.

9671
11:05:56,380 --> 11:06:00,380
So yeah, if you hate any of the scripts that the girls do,

9672
11:06:00,380 --> 11:06:04,380
you're welcome to just send a marshmallow and be like, you suck.

9673
11:06:04,380 --> 11:06:07,380
But yeah, I know, that's fine.

9674
11:06:10,380 --> 11:06:12,380
But yeah.

9675
11:06:13,380 --> 11:06:18,380
Hopefully for those of you who have never seen Assassin's Creed Brotherhood,

9676
11:06:18,380 --> 11:06:22,380
I may have given you a new opinion of the game.

9677
11:06:22,380 --> 11:06:27,380
Or maybe I've influenced your opinion of the game.

9678
11:06:30,380 --> 11:06:33,380
Better give them time out of time for me.

9679
11:06:42,380 --> 11:06:44,380
It's so annoying.

9680
11:06:44,380 --> 11:06:47,380
Like, I don't know when YouTube will fix that.

9681
11:06:47,380 --> 11:06:52,380
The thing is, YouTube is slowly becoming like a much better platform

9682
11:06:52,380 --> 11:06:55,380
to live stream on than Twitch.

9683
11:06:55,380 --> 11:06:57,380
There's no doubt about it in my head.

9684
11:06:57,380 --> 11:07:01,380
They are just so slow to catch up and implement things.

9685
11:07:01,380 --> 11:07:03,380
Like, so slow.

9686
11:07:05,380 --> 11:07:09,380
But I hope they fix that 12-hour reward thing.

9687
11:07:09,380 --> 11:07:15,380
Because if they do, then strapping for 14-hour streams!

9688
11:07:18,380 --> 11:07:21,380
Next paycheck, I'll pick up Assassin's Creed Brotherhood.

9689
11:07:21,380 --> 11:07:22,380
And two.

9690
11:07:22,380 --> 11:07:23,380
Mmm!

9691
11:07:23,380 --> 11:07:29,380
Actually, on Steam, you do require a Ubisoft account once you get it.

9692
11:07:29,380 --> 11:07:36,380
However, on Steam, Assassin's Creed Brotherhood is on sale right now for $5.

9693
11:07:36,380 --> 11:07:39,380
If you have it on your account, I think you can grab it.

9694
11:07:40,380 --> 11:07:42,380
But that's just for Brotherhood.

9695
11:07:44,380 --> 11:07:46,380
I don't know about the odd guys.

9696
11:07:50,380 --> 11:07:52,380
Sorry, I'm itching my face.

9697
11:07:58,380 --> 11:07:59,380
Good morning!

9698
11:07:59,380 --> 11:08:01,380
No, I didn't lie, I'm still here.

9699
11:08:02,380 --> 11:08:07,380
I thought I was going to do 10 hours, but I'm like, ah, we can do more.

9700
11:08:11,380 --> 11:08:15,380
Good morning to the sleepyheads and goodnight to the sleepyheads

9701
11:08:15,380 --> 11:08:17,380
because you're all probably sleepy.

9702
11:08:21,380 --> 11:08:24,380
It depends what you make for YouTube Discoverability

9703
11:08:24,380 --> 11:08:28,380
for streaming-only content for Discoverability.

9704
11:08:28,380 --> 11:08:36,380
Yeah, if you do Shorts, however, and ASMR, for example, then you can be discovered.

9705
11:08:36,380 --> 11:08:40,380
I don't know about how Twitch's Discoverability works, unfortunately.

9706
11:08:44,380 --> 11:08:47,380
It's 5pm here, I passed out most of the day.

9707
11:08:47,380 --> 11:08:49,380
Sounded like you needed the rest then.

9708
11:08:52,380 --> 11:08:55,380
I can feel deep vein thrombosis sitting in all right-

9709
11:08:55,380 --> 11:08:56,380
Do you need to stretch?

9710
11:08:56,380 --> 11:08:59,380
Maybe I should have told you to stretch.

9711
11:09:07,380 --> 11:09:13,380
I'm eating all the chips first because they're getting cold.

9712
11:09:15,380 --> 11:09:17,380
Twitch has very low Discoverability.

9713
11:09:17,380 --> 11:09:19,380
That's what I thought.

9714
11:09:19,380 --> 11:09:22,380
Whereas like YouTube, at least I know how YouTube works.

9715
11:09:23,380 --> 11:09:29,380
For the most part, I say that as if Emmy didn't get a warning on YouTube.

9716
11:09:39,380 --> 11:09:41,380
My brain's so American I thought you meant actual chips.

9717
11:09:41,380 --> 11:09:50,380
Ah, um, deep fried potato in a vat, in a rectangular, skinny, rectangular shape.

9718
11:09:52,380 --> 11:09:53,380
Yeah, man.

9719
11:09:58,380 --> 11:09:59,380
French fries.

9720
11:10:01,380 --> 11:10:04,380
Managed maggot, no, I'll get 100%.

9721
11:10:05,380 --> 11:10:09,380
I thought that was my cup for setting this all up.

9722
11:10:12,380 --> 11:10:13,380
Stinky management.

9723
11:10:13,380 --> 11:10:16,380
Imagine if I got graduated by my own management.

9724
11:10:17,380 --> 11:10:18,380
Uh-huh.

9725
11:10:19,380 --> 11:10:23,380
Um, they're not flavor.

9726
11:10:26,380 --> 11:10:28,380
With salt and fat, maybe.

9727
11:10:28,380 --> 11:10:30,380
And maybe large oil.

9728
11:10:34,380 --> 11:10:36,380
Is it management hate time?

9729
11:10:36,380 --> 11:10:38,380
Oh, is it that time already?

9730
11:10:40,380 --> 11:10:41,380
Scottish food stream.

9731
11:10:41,380 --> 11:10:44,380
I don't even think I have access to haggis here.

9732
11:10:45,380 --> 11:10:47,380
Which is a shame.

9733
11:10:48,380 --> 11:10:53,380
But I'm doing a Scottish game show on St Andrews for the girls.

9734
11:10:53,380 --> 11:11:00,380
I'm gonna like get them to guess Scottish memes or spell Scottish words

9735
11:11:00,380 --> 11:11:06,380
or tell me what the, the Scottish phrase says type thing.

9736
11:11:06,380 --> 11:11:07,380
Absurd.

9737
11:11:07,380 --> 11:11:09,380
When I eat, I burp a lot more.

9738
11:11:09,380 --> 11:11:11,380
I put all the junk in.

9739
11:11:11,380 --> 11:11:12,380
I'm so guessing.

9740
11:11:18,380 --> 11:11:20,380
School of rock.

9741
11:11:24,380 --> 11:11:25,380
Okay.

9742
11:11:25,380 --> 11:11:26,380
I finished my chippies.

9743
11:11:26,380 --> 11:11:28,380
I'm now going to inhale the booger.

9744
11:11:35,380 --> 11:11:37,380
I need to know what food places are good in Scotland.

9745
11:11:37,380 --> 11:11:38,380
Greggs!

9746
11:11:38,380 --> 11:11:40,380
That sounds terrible.

9747
11:11:40,380 --> 11:11:43,380
It's a British UK chain called Greggs.

9748
11:11:44,380 --> 11:11:52,380
And they do this thing called a cheese, bean and sausage pastry, pastry?

9749
11:11:52,380 --> 11:11:53,380
Pasty.

9750
11:11:54,380 --> 11:11:56,380
And, oh.

9751
11:11:58,380 --> 11:11:59,380
It is.

9752
11:12:00,380 --> 11:12:01,380
It is.

9753
11:12:02,380 --> 11:12:04,380
You know, it's so good.

9754
11:12:04,380 --> 11:12:08,380
I like the cheese and hamburger from Greggs as well.

9755
11:12:08,380 --> 11:12:09,380
Very good.

9756
11:12:09,380 --> 11:12:10,380
Very proof.

9757
11:12:11,380 --> 11:12:12,380
Mmm.

9758
11:12:12,380 --> 11:12:14,380
Tesco meal deal.

9759
11:12:14,380 --> 11:12:17,380
They used to be three quid, but they're not anymore.

9760
11:12:17,380 --> 11:12:19,380
Are they, are they 350 now?

9761
11:12:19,380 --> 11:12:21,380
Or is it going on more?

9762
11:12:28,380 --> 11:12:29,380
Oh.

9763
11:12:29,380 --> 11:12:30,380
Hold on.

9764
11:12:30,380 --> 11:12:31,380
Oh.

9765
11:12:37,380 --> 11:12:42,380
I, because I laughed, a bit of dry chip went like up back my nostril.

9766
11:12:42,380 --> 11:12:44,380
That was very painful momentarily.

9767
11:12:44,380 --> 11:12:45,380
Ew.

9768
11:12:49,380 --> 11:12:52,380
I've never had a chance to try protein.

9769
11:12:52,380 --> 11:12:59,380
I believe it's cheese and chips.

9770
11:13:01,380 --> 11:13:02,380
And gravy?

9771
11:13:02,380 --> 11:13:04,380
I'm taking big bite of burger.

9772
11:13:04,380 --> 11:13:05,380
Do you want bite first?

9773
11:13:05,380 --> 11:13:06,380
Go, ah.

9774
11:13:06,380 --> 11:13:08,380
You can get bite of burger first.

9775
11:13:08,380 --> 11:13:09,380
Ah.

9776
11:13:12,380 --> 11:13:15,380
Do you like, you're actually putting, oh yeah.

9777
11:13:15,380 --> 11:13:18,380
A and W is pretty nice too if you get to try them.

9778
11:13:18,380 --> 11:13:20,380
I don't know what A and W is.

9779
11:13:20,380 --> 11:13:21,380
I'm sorry.

9780
11:13:21,380 --> 11:13:25,380
Is it a supermarket or is it like a takeaway place?

9781
11:13:26,380 --> 11:13:27,380
Oh.

9782
11:13:29,380 --> 11:13:31,380
Oh, the burger club.

9783
11:13:31,380 --> 11:13:33,380
Chicken burger.

9784
11:13:33,380 --> 11:13:35,380
With crunchy lettuce.

9785
11:13:35,380 --> 11:13:36,380
Mmm.

9786
11:13:44,380 --> 11:13:47,380
Sorry, I've been traumatized for going, oh.

9787
11:13:47,380 --> 11:13:49,380
I didn't know she was going to do that.

9788
11:13:49,380 --> 11:13:50,380
I was like, oh.

9789
11:13:50,380 --> 11:13:51,380
Oh.

9790
11:13:54,380 --> 11:13:58,380
A and W is almost bust, really?

9791
11:14:00,380 --> 11:14:02,380
Protein Canada mentioned, yeah.

9792
11:14:02,380 --> 11:14:04,380
It's chips, gravy and cheese.

9793
11:14:04,380 --> 11:14:07,380
And you can customize it with bacon, sausage, egg,

9794
11:14:07,380 --> 11:14:09,380
or any food you can think of adding.

9795
11:14:09,380 --> 11:14:10,380
Mmm.

9796
11:14:10,380 --> 11:14:12,380
A and W is a fast food chain.

9797
11:14:12,380 --> 11:14:14,380
They have good chicken burgers.

9798
11:14:14,380 --> 11:14:16,380
Oh, I like chicken burgers.

9799
11:14:16,380 --> 11:14:20,380
When I was a child, I got to visit America.

9800
11:14:20,380 --> 11:14:21,380
Americaia!

9801
11:14:21,380 --> 11:14:22,380
Hello!

9802
11:14:22,380 --> 11:14:25,380
And I got to try McDonald's.

9803
11:14:25,380 --> 11:14:30,380
And we went to Red Lobster.

9804
11:14:30,380 --> 11:14:34,380
And there were real live lobsters in the tank

9805
11:14:34,380 --> 11:14:36,380
that could be picked out.

9806
11:14:36,380 --> 11:14:41,380
And we didn't like that.

9807
11:14:41,380 --> 11:14:43,380
We're not used to that.

9808
11:14:44,380 --> 11:14:46,380
And it's a unique thing.

9809
11:14:46,380 --> 11:14:49,380
But I completely understand that markets exist.

9810
11:14:49,380 --> 11:14:51,380
Obviously, there's fish markets.

9811
11:14:51,380 --> 11:14:53,380
You go and they're live fish and stuff.

9812
11:14:53,380 --> 11:14:56,380
All sitting about ready to get bought and sliced and diced.

9813
11:14:56,380 --> 11:14:58,380
I understand that's how the world works.

9814
11:14:58,380 --> 11:15:00,380
I would just have a soft little soul.

9815
11:15:00,380 --> 11:15:02,380
I say that as I eat chicken,

9816
11:15:02,380 --> 11:15:05,380
which is from a breed of chicken

9817
11:15:05,380 --> 11:15:09,380
that purposely grows meat,

9818
11:15:09,380 --> 11:15:11,380
weight at a really fast rate,

9819
11:15:11,380 --> 11:15:13,380
and is probably no older than 12 weeks.

9820
11:15:13,380 --> 11:15:16,380
I understand how hypocritical I'm being.

9821
11:15:16,380 --> 11:15:18,380
I comprehend that.

9822
11:15:18,380 --> 11:15:20,380
I do comprehend that.

9823
11:15:20,380 --> 11:15:22,380
I've got to sleep.

9824
11:15:22,380 --> 11:15:24,380
The Sandman calls me.

9825
11:15:24,380 --> 11:15:28,380
The Sandman from Spider-Man?

9826
11:15:28,380 --> 11:15:31,380
What kind of demons are you fighting?

9827
11:15:31,380 --> 11:15:34,380
If Sandman is your nemesis,

9828
11:15:34,380 --> 11:15:36,380
are you good?

9829
11:15:36,380 --> 11:15:37,380
Do you need help?

9830
11:15:37,380 --> 11:15:39,380
Are they jumping you?

9831
11:15:42,380 --> 11:15:44,380
Sleep well.

9832
11:15:46,380 --> 11:15:48,380
What's the Sandman?

9833
11:15:50,380 --> 11:15:53,380
Is it that song, Mr. Sandman?

9834
11:15:53,380 --> 11:15:55,380
Give me a dream.

9835
11:15:55,380 --> 11:15:57,380
Bum bum bum bum.

9836
11:15:57,380 --> 11:16:00,380
Make him the cutest that I've ever seen.

9837
11:16:00,380 --> 11:16:02,380
Yeah, but who is Mr. Sandman?

9838
11:16:05,380 --> 11:16:06,380
Is it Sleep Demon?

9839
11:16:06,380 --> 11:16:07,380
Is it actually?

9840
11:16:07,380 --> 11:16:08,380
I'll believe you.

9841
11:16:08,380 --> 11:16:09,380
I will believe you.

9842
11:16:12,380 --> 11:16:16,380
The Sandman is the one who puts fit...

9843
11:16:16,380 --> 11:16:18,380
I ain't reading all that.

9844
11:16:20,380 --> 11:16:21,380
Wait.

9845
11:16:21,380 --> 11:16:24,380
He puts the sleepy sand in your eyes

9846
11:16:24,380 --> 11:16:25,380
that make you go,

9847
11:16:25,380 --> 11:16:27,380
are you trolling me or is this real?

9848
11:16:27,380 --> 11:16:29,380
Sandman from the store?

9849
11:16:29,380 --> 11:16:31,380
American stories?

9850
11:16:33,380 --> 11:16:35,380
I have not heard of Sandman like this

9851
11:16:35,380 --> 11:16:37,380
in this content.

9852
11:16:38,380 --> 11:16:40,380
It's real?

9853
11:16:43,380 --> 11:16:44,380
Okay.

9854
11:16:44,380 --> 11:16:45,380
Wait.

9855
11:16:45,380 --> 11:16:48,380
So, is the song Mr. Sandman?

9856
11:16:48,380 --> 11:16:49,380
Give me a dream.

9857
11:16:49,380 --> 11:16:50,380
Bum bum bum.

9858
11:16:50,380 --> 11:16:51,380
Make him the cutest I've ever seen.

9859
11:16:51,380 --> 11:16:54,380
Is that someone asking Mr. Sandman

9860
11:16:54,380 --> 11:16:58,380
to give her a dream about a man she really likes?

9861
11:17:00,380 --> 11:17:01,380
He puts gunk in your eyes.

9862
11:17:01,380 --> 11:17:04,380
Okay, I'm starting to believe that's actually the lore.

9863
11:17:07,380 --> 11:17:08,380
Yes!

9864
11:17:12,380 --> 11:17:14,380
Today I learned.

9865
11:17:14,380 --> 11:17:15,380
Okay.

9866
11:17:17,380 --> 11:17:19,380
Is it like a story book

9867
11:17:19,380 --> 11:17:22,380
or is this lore from the song only?

9868
11:17:22,380 --> 11:17:25,380
The Sandman is a mythical character in European folklore

9869
11:17:25,380 --> 11:17:27,380
who puts people to sleep

9870
11:17:27,380 --> 11:17:29,380
and encourages and inspires beautiful dreams

9871
11:17:29,380 --> 11:17:31,380
by sprinkling magical sander.

9872
11:17:32,380 --> 11:17:35,380
Okay, that song makes complete sense now.

9873
11:17:35,380 --> 11:17:37,380
I've never heard that story.

9874
11:17:38,380 --> 11:17:41,380
I must love Mr. Sandman.

9875
11:17:41,380 --> 11:17:43,380
Give me a dream.

9876
11:17:43,380 --> 11:17:44,380
Bum bum bum.

9877
11:17:44,380 --> 11:17:47,380
Make him the cutest I've ever seen.

9878
11:17:47,380 --> 11:17:48,380
Bum bum bum.

9879
11:17:48,380 --> 11:17:52,380
Give him two lips like roses and clovers.

9880
11:17:56,380 --> 11:17:59,380
You've never watched Rise of the Guardian?

9881
11:17:59,380 --> 11:18:00,380
No.

9882
11:18:00,380 --> 11:18:03,380
I've watched Guardians of the Galaxy, though.

9883
11:18:03,380 --> 11:18:06,380
Baby, give me one more chance.

9884
11:18:08,380 --> 11:18:10,380
I eat more burger.

9885
11:18:18,380 --> 11:18:20,380
Sandman's on Rise of the Guardian.

9886
11:18:20,380 --> 11:18:21,380
That's cool.

9887
11:18:21,380 --> 11:18:23,380
It was Rise of the Guardian.

9888
11:18:23,380 --> 11:18:26,380
Sorry, I feel like every time you guys reference something,

9889
11:18:26,380 --> 11:18:27,380
I'm like, what's that?

9890
11:18:27,380 --> 11:18:29,380
Oh, what is this?

9891
11:18:29,380 --> 11:18:31,380
I've never heard of this before.

9892
11:18:31,380 --> 11:18:32,380
Hee hee.

9893
11:18:40,380 --> 11:18:42,380
Is it like Power of Alanis?

9894
11:18:43,380 --> 11:18:44,380
No.

9895
11:18:44,380 --> 11:18:46,380
The Secrets of Alanis?

9896
11:18:46,380 --> 11:18:47,380
Alanis.

9897
11:18:47,380 --> 11:18:49,380
This may be the name of the movie.

9898
11:18:52,380 --> 11:18:55,380
It's a movie with Jack Frost in it.

9899
11:18:55,380 --> 11:18:56,380
Okay.

9900
11:18:56,380 --> 11:18:57,380
Hmm.

9901
11:19:00,380 --> 11:19:03,380
Where this Sandman, Tooth Fairy, Santa Claus,

9902
11:19:03,380 --> 11:19:05,380
the Easter Bunny, and Jack Frost team up

9903
11:19:05,380 --> 11:19:07,380
to kick the crap out of a Nightmare Demon.

9904
11:19:07,380 --> 11:19:10,380
Ah, that sounds like a good movie.

9905
11:19:10,380 --> 11:19:11,380
Hmm.

9906
11:19:11,380 --> 11:19:13,380
Is it like Nightmare Before Christmas?

9907
11:19:13,380 --> 11:19:15,380
I love Nightmare Before Christmas.

9908
11:19:15,380 --> 11:19:17,380
We should watch Nightmare Before Christmas.

9909
11:19:17,380 --> 11:19:19,380
We have so many things to watch.

9910
11:19:19,380 --> 11:19:20,380
Life is good.

9911
11:19:23,380 --> 11:19:24,380
Hmm.

9912
11:19:27,380 --> 11:19:30,380
They put so much hot sauce on my boy boy.

9913
11:19:36,380 --> 11:19:37,380
Hmm.

9914
11:19:37,380 --> 11:19:39,380
Basically form an Avengers style team up.

9915
11:19:39,380 --> 11:19:40,380
Yeah.

9916
11:19:40,380 --> 11:19:42,380
I love Avengers one.

9917
11:19:42,380 --> 11:19:44,380
I know it's cringey, but I like it.

9918
11:19:44,380 --> 11:19:45,380
Hmm.

9919
11:19:46,380 --> 11:19:48,380
Ah, the sauce is burning my face.

9920
11:19:57,380 --> 11:19:59,380
Oh, she's buzzing.

9921
11:19:59,380 --> 11:20:00,380
She's buzzing.

9922
11:20:02,380 --> 11:20:03,380
Hmm.

9923
11:20:04,380 --> 11:20:05,380
Wow.

9924
11:20:06,380 --> 11:20:09,380
Oh, I can share my family's movie.

9925
11:20:09,380 --> 11:20:11,380
On Christmas.

9926
11:20:12,380 --> 11:20:15,380
The family movie is Trading Places,

9927
11:20:15,380 --> 11:20:17,380
and there's booba in it.

9928
11:20:17,380 --> 11:20:19,380
I used to watch it as a kid.

9929
11:20:20,380 --> 11:20:21,380
Look, there's booba.

9930
11:20:21,380 --> 11:20:22,380
Ah.

9931
11:20:24,380 --> 11:20:25,380
Hmm.

9932
11:20:27,380 --> 11:20:29,380
It's delicious.

9933
11:20:30,380 --> 11:20:32,380
After all my hard work today,

9934
11:20:32,380 --> 11:20:33,380
it wasn't hard work.

9935
11:20:33,380 --> 11:20:35,380
I literally got to just gleam about

9936
11:20:35,380 --> 11:20:36,380
my favorite video game.

9937
11:20:36,380 --> 11:20:37,380
It's not work.

9938
11:20:37,380 --> 11:20:39,380
I promise you, this stuff ain't work.

9939
11:20:39,380 --> 11:20:42,380
If each of them feels like work,

9940
11:20:43,380 --> 11:20:44,380
then...

9941
11:20:46,380 --> 11:20:48,380
then I will give you the advice

9942
11:20:48,380 --> 11:20:49,380
of just do what you want,

9943
11:20:49,380 --> 11:20:50,380
and then it doesn't feel like work.

9944
11:20:50,380 --> 11:20:51,380
Hmm.

9945
11:20:51,380 --> 11:20:52,380
But oh wait, no, that's a responsible.

9946
11:20:52,380 --> 11:20:53,380
I shouldn't say that.

9947
11:20:53,380 --> 11:20:54,380
I'm not kidding.

9948
11:20:54,380 --> 11:20:56,380
Is there a sneak peek of the Eat Sweet Stream?

9949
11:20:56,380 --> 11:20:58,380
No, I don't even have the sweets.

9950
11:20:59,380 --> 11:21:00,380
Um.

9951
11:21:00,380 --> 11:21:03,380
I might have to get my nails did for it.

9952
11:21:03,380 --> 11:21:04,380
Ah.

9953
11:21:07,380 --> 11:21:08,380
Jamie Lee Biba?

9954
11:21:08,380 --> 11:21:09,380
I mean Biba Lee Curtis?

9955
11:21:09,380 --> 11:21:13,380
I used to think that Jamie Lee Curtis

9956
11:21:13,380 --> 11:21:15,380
was Princess Leia,

9957
11:21:15,380 --> 11:21:18,380
because I grew up watching Star Wars.

9958
11:21:18,380 --> 11:21:21,380
So when I saw her, I was like,

9959
11:21:22,380 --> 11:21:23,380
Dad!

9960
11:21:23,380 --> 11:21:24,380
Like, I was a child child.

9961
11:21:24,380 --> 11:21:25,380
I was like,

9962
11:21:25,380 --> 11:21:27,380
Dad, why is Princess Leia's boobies on the tail?

9963
11:21:29,380 --> 11:21:31,380
Um, basically.

9964
11:21:38,380 --> 11:21:39,380
No, no.

9965
11:21:39,380 --> 11:21:40,380
Okay.

9966
11:21:40,380 --> 11:21:43,380
I don't think I can eat any more of the burger.

9967
11:21:44,380 --> 11:21:47,380
It appears I don't have a large appetite,

9968
11:21:47,380 --> 11:21:48,380
but I wonder if it's just because

9969
11:21:48,380 --> 11:21:50,380
I've been having such a good time that, like,

9970
11:21:50,380 --> 11:21:52,380
I did actually have that fruit,

9971
11:21:52,380 --> 11:21:54,380
which fruit is actually really good for fiber,

9972
11:21:54,380 --> 11:21:57,380
so maybe that's why I don't feel like eating the full thing.

9973
11:21:58,380 --> 11:22:00,380
Oh, I'm such a skinny legend.

9974
11:22:00,380 --> 11:22:03,380
Okay, let's finish up this whole layer of bromelain.

9975
11:22:03,380 --> 11:22:05,380
I think I was gifted this game a long time ago

9976
11:22:05,380 --> 11:22:07,380
and never ended up playing on it.

9977
11:22:07,380 --> 11:22:08,380
Mmm!

9978
11:22:08,380 --> 11:22:12,380
So, Assassin's Creed Brotherhood is the second

9979
11:22:12,380 --> 11:22:16,380
installment of Ezio Auditory's story, The Assassin.

9980
11:22:16,380 --> 11:22:20,380
Um, it's my favourite game of all time.

9981
11:22:21,380 --> 11:22:27,380
Um, I can only recommend it if you like,

9982
11:22:27,380 --> 11:22:31,380
kind of role-playing and you like games that hold your hand,

9983
11:22:31,380 --> 11:22:33,380
like, it's perfect.

9984
11:22:33,380 --> 11:22:35,380
We've finished the campaign already.

9985
11:22:35,380 --> 11:22:37,380
We finished it a couple hours ago now.

9986
11:22:37,380 --> 11:22:43,380
Um, and we're just finishing up a kind of side quest-esque sequence,

9987
11:22:43,380 --> 11:22:48,380
which is going to unlock some very OP armor.

9988
11:22:48,380 --> 11:22:50,380
It's a really good game.

9989
11:22:50,380 --> 11:22:51,380
I do recommend it.

9990
11:22:51,380 --> 11:22:55,380
I don't know if it's a game for a stream for the first time

9991
11:22:55,380 --> 11:22:57,380
you've ever played it.

9992
11:22:57,380 --> 11:22:59,380
I don't know, like, I mean, I love the game,

9993
11:22:59,380 --> 11:23:01,380
but obviously it's really hard to tell, like,

9994
11:23:01,380 --> 11:23:02,380
what kind of game someone would be into.

9995
11:23:02,380 --> 11:23:05,380
And Emi, I know you said you weren't the biggest,

9996
11:23:05,380 --> 11:23:07,380
like, strongest gamer, but you're like a weebo

9997
11:23:07,380 --> 11:23:09,380
or a gamer-type thing.

9998
11:23:09,380 --> 11:23:11,380
Um, but this is definitely friend.

9999
11:23:11,380 --> 11:23:13,380
I would say Brotherhood's friendly to, like, new gamers,

10000
11:23:13,380 --> 11:23:17,380
is once you understand the controls,

10001
11:23:17,380 --> 11:23:19,380
but then again, I have played the game like a...

10002
11:23:19,380 --> 11:23:21,380
Oh, I did not mean to do that.

10003
11:23:21,380 --> 11:23:25,380
Um, but I have played the game, like, a billion times over, so...

10004
11:23:25,380 --> 11:23:27,380
Can people stream through 12 hours on YouTube?

10005
11:23:27,380 --> 11:23:32,380
Sadly, no, the VOD ends up getting really broken

10006
11:23:32,380 --> 11:23:34,380
at the 12-hour mark, so I will be...

10007
11:23:34,380 --> 11:23:38,380
Oh, I don't want to end...

10008
11:23:39,380 --> 11:23:42,380
Oh, it's becoming my bedtime soon, though.

10009
11:23:42,380 --> 11:23:44,380
Oh, I don't want to end.

10010
11:23:44,380 --> 11:23:47,380
Right, well, very quickly do the last layer.

10011
11:23:47,380 --> 11:23:50,380
I didn't realise how long it took me to eat that food there.

10012
11:23:50,380 --> 11:23:53,380
I apologise. I should have... I should have sped that up.

10013
11:23:53,380 --> 11:23:55,380
Sorry.

10014
11:23:55,380 --> 11:23:58,380
Right, we will take a... this to the tunnel

10015
11:23:58,380 --> 11:24:01,380
to go where we need to go for this last...

10016
11:24:01,380 --> 11:24:03,380
to the Il Colosseum,

10017
11:24:03,380 --> 11:24:05,380
because that's where we need to go last,

10018
11:24:05,380 --> 11:24:07,380
and then we will get the armour,

10019
11:24:07,380 --> 11:24:09,380
because that's why we have had a fantastic

10020
11:24:09,380 --> 11:24:11,380
first official stream,

10021
11:24:11,380 --> 11:24:13,380
um, debut stream,

10022
11:24:13,380 --> 11:24:16,380
and the exposing wheeler and all that.

10023
11:24:16,380 --> 11:24:19,380
Don't count, um...

10024
11:24:19,380 --> 11:24:22,380
because I said they don't count, smile.

10025
11:24:22,380 --> 11:24:24,380
Um...

10026
11:24:24,380 --> 11:24:26,380
This is, like, actual stream.

10027
11:24:26,380 --> 11:24:28,380
This is just me doing my hang.

10028
11:24:28,380 --> 11:24:30,380
I know I said I...

10029
11:24:30,380 --> 11:24:34,380
Oh! It's you! You can't just jump on folk like that!

10030
11:24:35,380 --> 11:24:37,380
That's inappropriate of me!

10031
11:24:37,380 --> 11:24:39,380
You're going to get done for that.

10032
11:24:39,380 --> 11:24:41,380
You're going to get the jail.

10033
11:24:41,380 --> 11:24:43,380
They're going to give you the jail. They're going to take you away.

10034
11:24:43,380 --> 11:24:45,380
Eh, see, they need to do that again,

10035
11:24:45,380 --> 11:24:47,380
because that was actually really scary.

10036
11:24:47,380 --> 11:24:49,380
That was, like, a vampire launch.

10037
11:24:49,380 --> 11:24:51,380
Like...

10038
11:24:51,380 --> 11:24:53,380
What would Colosseum mean?

10039
11:24:53,380 --> 11:24:55,380
Randomly tops.

10040
11:24:55,380 --> 11:24:57,380
Literally, like, uh...

10041
11:24:57,380 --> 11:24:59,380
Eh, see, that's dangerous.

10042
11:24:59,380 --> 11:25:01,380
You're 35 minutes away from the travel.

10043
11:25:01,380 --> 11:25:03,380
No, don't say that!

10044
11:25:04,380 --> 11:25:06,380
Hmm.

10045
11:25:06,380 --> 11:25:08,380
Uh...

10046
11:25:08,380 --> 11:25:10,380
Uh, hold on.

10047
11:25:10,380 --> 11:25:14,380
Uh, I'm using my thigh to run right now, like a five-head.

10048
11:25:14,380 --> 11:25:16,380
Oh, hold on. Hold on.

10049
11:25:16,380 --> 11:25:19,380
You can tell. You can tell I'm not using agile controls.

10050
11:25:19,380 --> 11:25:21,380
Oh, it's on the outside. It's on the outside.

10051
11:25:21,380 --> 11:25:23,380
Here, here, yeah.

10052
11:25:23,380 --> 11:25:25,380
You walk past it when you actually deliver...

10053
11:25:25,380 --> 11:25:27,380
Do the deliver the male one.

10054
11:25:27,380 --> 11:25:29,380
Um...

10055
11:25:29,380 --> 11:25:31,380
Okay, boom, boom, boom, boom. Already there.

10056
11:25:31,380 --> 11:25:33,380
Already there!

10057
11:25:33,380 --> 11:25:35,380
At least this, we're gonna get our armor,

10058
11:25:35,380 --> 11:25:37,380
and then we are done, zoop.

10059
11:25:38,380 --> 11:25:40,380
I cannot for the life of me

10060
11:25:40,380 --> 11:25:42,380
remember what's behind this whole, uh,

10061
11:25:42,380 --> 11:25:45,380
of this layer of Romulae.

10062
11:25:45,380 --> 11:25:47,380
Romulus!

10063
11:25:47,380 --> 11:25:49,380
Keep saying Romulae.

10064
11:25:49,380 --> 11:25:51,380
Is it because of Star Trek? I'm saying Romulae.

10065
11:25:51,380 --> 11:25:53,380
It is!

10066
11:25:53,380 --> 11:25:55,380
It's because of Star Trek.

10067
11:25:56,380 --> 11:25:59,380
I think he doodoo-ed Star Trek.

10068
11:25:59,380 --> 11:26:01,380
Yeah!

10069
11:26:01,380 --> 11:26:03,380
I also watch Star Trek.

10070
11:26:03,380 --> 11:26:05,380
What?

10071
11:26:05,380 --> 11:26:07,380
Star Trek Voyager?

10072
11:26:07,380 --> 11:26:09,380
A bit of Deep Space Nine,

10073
11:26:09,380 --> 11:26:11,380
and, uh...

10074
11:26:11,380 --> 11:26:13,380
Captain Picard?

10075
11:26:13,380 --> 11:26:15,380
I cannot remember.

10076
11:26:15,380 --> 11:26:17,380
I wouldn't say Star Trek Original, but that's...

10077
11:26:17,380 --> 11:26:19,380
I don't think that's right.

10078
11:26:19,380 --> 11:26:21,380
Star Trek Origin?

10079
11:26:21,380 --> 11:26:23,380
Bet that too.

10080
11:26:23,380 --> 11:26:25,380
Would be Romulae.

10081
11:26:25,380 --> 11:26:27,380
Yeah, that's why I keep saying Romulae.

10082
11:26:27,380 --> 11:26:30,380
Instead of Romulus, it's because I watch Star Trek.

10083
11:26:31,380 --> 11:26:33,380
Um...

10084
11:26:33,380 --> 11:26:35,380
Oh, I wonder why you watch Star Trek.

10085
11:26:35,380 --> 11:26:37,380
Oh, surprise, surprise.

10086
11:26:37,380 --> 11:26:39,380
It's my dad, yet again, got me into it.

10087
11:26:39,380 --> 11:26:41,380
I can't believe it. My dad's the reason

10088
11:26:41,380 --> 11:26:43,380
why I actually have a personality.

10089
11:26:43,380 --> 11:26:45,380
That is terrible.

10090
11:26:45,380 --> 11:26:47,380
That's not nice.

10091
11:26:47,380 --> 11:26:49,380
Don't say things like that.

10092
11:26:49,380 --> 11:26:51,380
Assassin must suffer as we must suffer.

10093
11:26:51,380 --> 11:26:53,380
I forgot

10094
11:26:53,380 --> 11:26:55,380
what 100% was.

10095
11:26:55,380 --> 11:26:57,380
Do not lose more than three health blocks.

10096
11:26:57,380 --> 11:26:59,380
Easy, peasy, lemon,

10097
11:27:00,380 --> 11:27:02,380
Please don't launch at me.

10098
11:27:02,380 --> 11:27:04,380
Okay, there we go. We got the small knife out.

10099
11:27:04,380 --> 11:27:06,380
That's all we need.

10100
11:27:06,380 --> 11:27:08,380
Right, three health blocks.

10101
11:27:08,380 --> 11:27:10,380
As long as they don't do throwing knives,

10102
11:27:10,380 --> 11:27:12,380
then it's perfectly fine. Did you hear that stress

10103
11:27:12,380 --> 11:27:14,380
when I had to counter that attack there?

10104
11:27:14,380 --> 11:27:16,380
Okay.

10105
11:27:16,380 --> 11:27:18,380
Come at me.

10106
11:27:29,380 --> 11:27:31,380
Never.

10107
11:27:31,380 --> 11:27:33,380
Never.

10108
11:27:33,380 --> 11:27:35,380
Gee, that sure makes you look innocent.

10109
11:27:35,380 --> 11:27:37,380
Not.

10110
11:27:37,380 --> 11:27:39,380
Uh, again,

10111
11:27:39,380 --> 11:27:41,380
I believe this is time,

10112
11:27:41,380 --> 11:27:43,380
so I might try hard a little bit.

10113
11:27:45,380 --> 11:27:47,380
I can't believe it.

10114
11:27:47,380 --> 11:27:49,380
I'm such a sweat.

10115
11:27:49,380 --> 11:27:51,380
Who goes there?

10116
11:27:51,380 --> 11:27:53,380
Identify yourself.

10117
11:27:55,380 --> 11:27:57,380
I was on him.

10118
11:27:57,380 --> 11:27:59,380
I guess this sequence,

10119
11:27:59,380 --> 11:28:01,380
you're not at all supposed to catch him,

10120
11:28:01,380 --> 11:28:03,380
but I'm actually just such an MLG gamer

10121
11:28:03,380 --> 11:28:05,380
that I caught right up to him.

10122
11:28:05,380 --> 11:28:07,380
I literally could yank on his cloak like yaga.

10123
11:28:07,380 --> 11:28:09,380
Thank you.

10124
11:28:13,380 --> 11:28:15,380
Yeah.

10125
11:28:15,380 --> 11:28:17,380
Oh, okay, I remember this.

10126
11:28:17,380 --> 11:28:19,380
Yeah, there's like a party going on.

10127
11:28:19,380 --> 11:28:21,380
Oh my God, that lag because it's loading the area.

10128
11:28:21,380 --> 11:28:23,380
Jubilee Performers

10129
11:28:23,380 --> 11:28:25,380
has an access database.

10130
11:28:25,380 --> 11:28:27,380
I never sat in red.

10131
11:28:27,380 --> 11:28:29,380
What's up with this game?

10132
11:28:29,380 --> 11:28:31,380
Oh, what am I supposed to do?

10133
11:28:31,380 --> 11:28:33,380
Am I supposed to follow in that way?

10134
11:28:35,380 --> 11:28:37,380
Uh, right.

10135
11:28:37,380 --> 11:28:39,380
Go up the ladders.

10136
11:28:39,380 --> 11:28:41,380
Clearly, yeah, clearly he's going to shut down that wall.

10137
11:28:41,380 --> 11:28:43,380
I'm so sorry.

10138
11:28:47,380 --> 11:28:49,380
I bless your dad.

10139
11:28:49,380 --> 11:28:51,380
Literally make me...

10140
11:28:51,380 --> 11:28:53,380
Oh no, I've never correctly done this

10141
11:28:53,380 --> 11:28:55,380
horse sequence.

10142
11:28:55,380 --> 11:28:57,380
I just want you all to know.

10143
11:28:57,380 --> 11:28:59,380
So you can catch him in this sequence.

10144
11:28:59,380 --> 11:29:01,380
I never seem to catch up.

10145
11:29:01,380 --> 11:29:03,380
I don't know what I'm supposed to do

10146
11:29:03,380 --> 11:29:05,380
to make it happen.

10147
11:29:05,380 --> 11:29:07,380
Um,

10148
11:29:07,380 --> 11:29:09,380
but yeah.

10149
11:29:09,380 --> 11:29:11,380
Gee, I wonder why I've never made the sequence.

10150
11:29:11,380 --> 11:29:13,380
Me who does that.

10151
11:29:13,380 --> 11:29:15,380
I'm like pretty sure at the end

10152
11:29:15,380 --> 11:29:17,380
you're supposed to be able to jump on him

10153
11:29:17,380 --> 11:29:19,380
and I never make the timing.

10154
11:29:19,380 --> 11:29:21,380
It doesn't matter what happens.

10155
11:29:21,380 --> 11:29:23,380
Oh,

10156
11:29:23,380 --> 11:29:25,380
Gee, I wonder why I never catch up to him.

10157
11:29:25,380 --> 11:29:27,380
Surely it's a mystery.

10158
11:29:27,380 --> 11:29:29,380
No one

10159
11:29:29,380 --> 11:29:31,380
can solve this mathematical equation

10160
11:29:31,380 --> 11:29:33,380
as to why I've never caught up

10161
11:29:33,380 --> 11:29:35,380
with this guy.

10162
11:29:35,380 --> 11:29:37,380
Right, this is when I'm supposed to be able to do it.

10163
11:29:41,380 --> 11:29:43,380
Hi Jack.

10164
11:29:43,380 --> 11:29:45,380
Please.

10165
11:29:45,380 --> 11:29:47,380
What is go...

10166
11:29:51,380 --> 11:29:53,380
Exio?

10167
11:29:53,380 --> 11:29:55,380
Exio.

10168
11:29:55,380 --> 11:29:57,380
Son.

10169
11:29:57,380 --> 11:29:59,380
Son, do you want to talk about what just happened

10170
11:29:59,380 --> 11:30:01,380
or are we just going to pretend that didn't occur?

10171
11:30:03,380 --> 11:30:05,380
It'll literally...

10172
11:30:05,380 --> 11:30:07,380
Oh, I do not want to get in a fight with him.

10173
11:30:07,380 --> 11:30:09,380
So we're just going to sneak on by.

10174
11:30:09,380 --> 11:30:11,380
Sneak on by.

10175
11:30:15,380 --> 11:30:17,380
Oh, we've been here before.

10176
11:30:17,380 --> 11:30:19,380
We have been here before.

10177
11:30:19,380 --> 11:30:21,380
Wee.

10178
11:30:25,380 --> 11:30:27,380
Eh?

10179
11:30:27,380 --> 11:30:29,380
I knew under the stairs

10180
11:30:29,380 --> 11:30:31,380
looked like a game,

10181
11:30:31,380 --> 11:30:33,380
like an addition.

10182
11:30:33,380 --> 11:30:35,380
I knew it.

10183
11:30:35,380 --> 11:30:37,380
I forgot.

10184
11:30:37,380 --> 11:30:39,380
Ah.

10185
11:30:39,380 --> 11:30:41,380
I knew under the stairs

10186
11:30:41,380 --> 11:30:43,380
it looked like there was something there.

10187
11:30:43,380 --> 11:30:45,380
Oh my god, I'm actually just...

10188
11:30:45,380 --> 11:30:47,380
I'm just so smart like that,

10189
11:30:47,380 --> 11:30:49,380
like seriously for real for real.

10190
11:30:49,380 --> 11:30:51,380
Did Exio just

10191
11:30:51,380 --> 11:30:53,380
stuff him in his pocket?

10192
11:30:53,380 --> 11:30:55,380
Literally.

10193
11:30:55,380 --> 11:30:57,380
We did it!

10194
11:30:57,380 --> 11:30:59,380
We got the armor.

10195
11:30:59,380 --> 11:31:01,380
Codex sheet acquired.

10196
11:31:01,380 --> 11:31:03,380
Return to room.

10197
11:31:09,380 --> 11:31:11,380
Galaticator.

10198
11:31:11,380 --> 11:31:13,380
On the escalator.

10199
11:31:13,380 --> 11:31:15,380
On the escalator.

10200
11:31:15,380 --> 11:31:17,380
Animal crossing villager attack.

10201
11:31:19,380 --> 11:31:21,380
I did it! We did it!

10202
11:31:21,380 --> 11:31:23,380
No, I'm going to show you where

10203
11:31:23,380 --> 11:31:25,380
the treasure room

10204
11:31:25,380 --> 11:31:27,380
is hidden. It took me a very long time

10205
11:31:27,380 --> 11:31:29,380
on my first playthrough to figure out

10206
11:31:29,380 --> 11:31:31,380
where on Earth this treasure room was.

10207
11:31:31,380 --> 11:31:33,380
Have you seen the movie Gladiator?

10208
11:31:33,380 --> 11:31:35,380
I haven't!

10209
11:31:35,380 --> 11:31:37,380
You want to watch this together

10210
11:31:37,380 --> 11:31:39,380
sometime with me?

10211
11:31:39,380 --> 11:31:41,380
What happens if we

10212
11:31:41,380 --> 11:31:43,380
did lots of

10213
11:31:43,380 --> 11:31:45,380
watch-alongs of all the movies I haven't seen?

10214
11:31:45,380 --> 11:31:47,380
Because I haven't seen a lot of mainstream

10215
11:31:47,380 --> 11:31:49,380
movies.

10216
11:31:49,380 --> 11:31:51,380
Because I'm

10217
11:31:51,380 --> 11:31:53,380
a gamer and I kind of just play

10218
11:31:53,380 --> 11:31:55,380
games and that's all I do.

10219
11:31:55,380 --> 11:31:57,380
I don't really watch much

10220
11:31:57,380 --> 11:31:59,380
anime.

10221
11:31:59,380 --> 11:32:01,380
And I hope that's not

10222
11:32:01,380 --> 11:32:03,380
disappointing to anyone, but

10223
11:32:03,380 --> 11:32:05,380
I think it's good that all of us have a mix.

10224
11:32:05,380 --> 11:32:07,380
Some of us are clearly a weeble

10225
11:32:07,380 --> 11:32:09,380
gamer type thing.

10226
11:32:09,380 --> 11:32:11,380
My strength is like

10227
11:32:11,380 --> 11:32:13,380
strength in quotation marks.

10228
11:32:13,380 --> 11:32:15,380
My strength is that I can play

10229
11:32:15,380 --> 11:32:17,380
games.

10230
11:32:17,380 --> 11:32:19,380
No strongy.

10231
11:32:19,380 --> 11:32:21,380
That's not what strength means.

10232
11:32:21,380 --> 11:32:23,380
However,

10233
11:32:23,380 --> 11:32:25,380
my

10234
11:32:25,380 --> 11:32:27,380
accolades,

10235
11:32:27,380 --> 11:32:29,380
I just always enjoyed gaming.

10236
11:32:29,380 --> 11:32:31,380
I did get very lucky.

10237
11:32:31,380 --> 11:32:33,380
I've heard some stories from

10238
11:32:33,380 --> 11:32:35,380
girls being like,

10239
11:32:35,380 --> 11:32:37,380
their parents actively discouraged them

10240
11:32:37,380 --> 11:32:39,380
from gaming and I'm like

10241
11:32:39,380 --> 11:32:41,380
I just feel so bad

10242
11:32:41,380 --> 11:32:43,380
because I am very

10243
11:32:43,380 --> 11:32:45,380
lucky and I get so much enjoyment.

10244
11:32:45,380 --> 11:32:47,380
So much enjoyment

10245
11:32:47,380 --> 11:32:49,380
out of the games that I'm about to

10246
11:32:49,380 --> 11:32:51,380
sneeze about to play.

10247
11:32:51,380 --> 11:32:53,380
I just went away because I called it out.

10248
11:32:53,380 --> 11:32:55,380
I have absolutely no idea

10249
11:32:55,380 --> 11:32:57,380
where I'm trying to go to get to this.

10250
11:32:57,380 --> 11:32:59,380
Okay, I just need to go around the hill.

10251
11:32:59,380 --> 11:33:01,380
It's fine.

10252
11:33:01,380 --> 11:33:03,380
I've heard some stories about girls being

10253
11:33:03,380 --> 11:33:05,380
like I just called it out.

10254
11:33:05,380 --> 11:33:07,380
It's just such a shame.

10255
11:33:07,380 --> 11:33:09,380
Actually, you know what?

10256
11:33:09,380 --> 11:33:11,380
I take that back.

10257
11:33:11,380 --> 11:33:13,380
I've also heard stories from guys

10258
11:33:13,380 --> 11:33:15,380
like their parents are like,

10259
11:33:15,380 --> 11:33:17,380
you're just wasting your life on games.

10260
11:33:17,380 --> 11:33:19,380
What am I supposed to do as a pastime

10261
11:33:19,380 --> 11:33:21,380
in a hobby? Everyone has something

10262
11:33:21,380 --> 11:33:23,380
that helps them get through the day.

10263
11:33:23,380 --> 11:33:25,380
I'm not being funny.

10264
11:33:25,380 --> 11:33:27,380
I'm really happy to get into the subject

10265
11:33:27,380 --> 11:33:29,380
of how humans

10266
11:33:29,380 --> 11:33:31,380
recreationally need to deal

10267
11:33:31,380 --> 11:33:33,380
with daily working life.

10268
11:33:33,380 --> 11:33:35,380
So some people use drinking.

10269
11:33:35,380 --> 11:33:37,380
Some people use smoking.

10270
11:33:37,380 --> 11:33:39,380
Some people use recreational drugs

10271
11:33:39,380 --> 11:33:41,380
in order to cope with the stresses of the day.

10272
11:33:41,380 --> 11:33:43,380
And like

10273
11:33:43,380 --> 11:33:45,380
folk who act like

10274
11:33:45,380 --> 11:33:47,380
gay men is like this.

10275
11:33:47,380 --> 11:33:49,380
Oh, by the way, this is where the treasure room is hiding.

10276
11:33:49,380 --> 11:33:51,380
It doesn't look like it, but in this little room

10277
11:33:51,380 --> 11:33:53,380
where you kill the captain for this

10278
11:33:53,380 --> 11:33:55,380
bourgeois area, you

10279
11:33:55,380 --> 11:33:57,380
climb up and then you find the treasure room.

10280
11:33:57,380 --> 11:33:59,380
Um...

10281
11:33:59,380 --> 11:34:01,380
And like, literally, I find it like such a shame

10282
11:34:01,380 --> 11:34:03,380
because like,

10283
11:34:03,380 --> 11:34:05,380
you don't really realize how supportive your parents are

10284
11:34:05,380 --> 11:34:07,380
until you get told stories.

10285
11:34:07,380 --> 11:34:09,380
Right, I'll show up, because it's big.

10286
11:34:14,380 --> 11:34:16,380
Wow!

10287
11:34:17,380 --> 11:34:19,380
It looks like shade.

10288
11:34:19,380 --> 11:34:21,380
Honestly, this is pretty bad.

10289
11:34:22,380 --> 11:34:24,380
I mean, it looks good, but it looks bad.

10290
11:34:24,380 --> 11:34:26,380
At the same time.

10291
11:34:28,380 --> 11:34:30,380
Oh, Jesus.

10292
11:34:31,380 --> 11:34:33,380
I mean...

10293
11:34:33,380 --> 11:34:35,380
I mean, it's alright.

10294
11:34:36,380 --> 11:34:38,380
I don't...

10295
11:34:38,380 --> 11:34:40,380
I much prefer alpires.

10296
11:34:40,380 --> 11:34:42,380
Armor.

10297
11:34:42,380 --> 11:34:44,380
From AC-1. AC-2.

10298
11:34:44,380 --> 11:34:46,380
Um, when you unlock all the seals.

10299
11:34:47,380 --> 11:34:49,380
Germans? Oh!

10300
11:34:49,380 --> 11:34:51,380
I read that as

10301
11:34:51,380 --> 11:34:53,380
Germans truly are the most repressed group in society.

10302
11:34:53,380 --> 11:34:55,380
Gamers are the most repressed

10303
11:34:55,380 --> 11:34:58,380
group in society. Even alcohol and smokers get more, right?

10304
11:34:58,380 --> 11:35:00,380
Yeah, literally, games are the reason

10305
11:35:00,380 --> 11:35:02,380
why you can use the right side of my body like normal.

10306
11:35:02,380 --> 11:35:04,380
Yeah, like, everyone

10307
11:35:04,380 --> 11:35:06,380
needs something that helps them de-stress

10308
11:35:06,380 --> 11:35:08,380
from daily life.

10309
11:35:08,380 --> 11:35:10,380
And like, I just feel so sad that people

10310
11:35:10,380 --> 11:35:12,380
like, genuinely have like...

10311
11:35:13,380 --> 11:35:15,380
I suppose if you get into the conversation

10312
11:35:15,380 --> 11:35:17,380
of like, loved ones and...

10313
11:35:19,380 --> 11:35:21,380
Like, nothing they have to support

10314
11:35:21,380 --> 11:35:23,380
everything you do, like, that's not how it works in the real world.

10315
11:35:23,380 --> 11:35:26,380
But like, I don't know, I just...

10316
11:35:26,380 --> 11:35:28,380
I couldn't imagine

10317
11:35:28,380 --> 11:35:30,380
like, my mom and dad

10318
11:35:30,380 --> 11:35:32,380
being like...

10319
11:35:33,380 --> 11:35:35,380
Or...

10320
11:35:35,380 --> 11:35:37,380
like, you're on the Xbox.

10321
11:35:37,380 --> 11:35:39,380
Well, actually, so they did kind of say that, but

10322
11:35:39,380 --> 11:35:41,380
I was having problems with social anxiety and all that

10323
11:35:41,380 --> 11:35:43,380
and I couldn't go outside in that. So that's different.

10324
11:35:43,380 --> 11:35:45,380
That section's different.

10325
11:35:45,380 --> 11:35:47,380
But, like,

10326
11:35:47,380 --> 11:35:49,380
genuinely, like, at no point

10327
11:35:49,380 --> 11:35:51,380
where like, my mom and dad disappointed in me

10328
11:35:51,380 --> 11:35:53,380
because I liked the game. And they like, supported it.

10329
11:35:53,380 --> 11:35:55,380
Like, my mom

10330
11:35:55,380 --> 11:35:57,380
she played the original Lara Croft

10331
11:35:57,380 --> 11:35:59,380
Tomb Raider and like, my dad

10332
11:35:59,380 --> 11:36:01,380
obviously showed me a whole

10333
11:36:01,380 --> 11:36:03,380
insane category of games

10334
11:36:03,380 --> 11:36:05,380
that got me used to like, all these different categories

10335
11:36:05,380 --> 11:36:07,380
and...

10336
11:36:07,380 --> 11:36:09,380
that kind of thing. And it's just like, really nice.

10337
11:36:09,380 --> 11:36:11,380
Like, my dad, he absolutely

10338
11:36:11,380 --> 11:36:13,380
loves to tell the story about how he gave me an Xbox

10339
11:36:13,380 --> 11:36:15,380
and

10340
11:36:15,380 --> 11:36:17,380
he'll probably tell it

10341
11:36:17,380 --> 11:36:19,380
when I do my interview with him.

10342
11:36:19,380 --> 11:36:21,380
And I say

10343
11:36:21,380 --> 11:36:23,380
interview. I'm just getting my dad to talk

10344
11:36:23,380 --> 11:36:25,380
about it.

10345
11:36:25,380 --> 11:36:27,380
But talk about, like, how does it feel

10346
11:36:27,380 --> 11:36:29,380
that your daughter's a slag? And then

10347
11:36:29,380 --> 11:36:31,380
he goes, it feels pretty good

10348
11:36:31,380 --> 11:36:33,380
because I'm going to retire

10349
11:36:33,380 --> 11:36:35,380
and da-da-da-da-da.

10350
11:36:35,380 --> 11:36:37,380
Um...

10351
11:36:37,380 --> 11:36:39,380
I don't know what's going on here. Like, some people know this.

10352
11:36:39,380 --> 11:36:41,380
Like, I managed to...

10353
11:36:41,380 --> 11:36:43,380
Because of the banks

10354
11:36:43,380 --> 11:36:45,380
and job issues and all that kind of thing

10355
11:36:45,380 --> 11:36:47,380
basically, the house was going to get repossessed.

10356
11:36:47,380 --> 11:36:49,380
Like, the family home was going to get repossessed.

10357
11:36:49,380 --> 11:36:51,380
Because, you know, they kind of keep up

10358
11:36:51,380 --> 11:36:53,380
with mortgage payments. So then I bought it.

10359
11:36:53,380 --> 11:36:55,380
Like, I don't own it.

10360
11:36:55,380 --> 11:36:57,380
Like, my parents own it. But, like, I

10361
11:36:57,380 --> 11:36:59,380
did the difference.

10362
11:36:59,380 --> 11:37:01,380
Um...

10363
11:37:01,380 --> 11:37:03,380
And my dad's like...

10364
11:37:03,380 --> 11:37:05,380
He's kind of joking when he says, like, the only reason

10365
11:37:05,380 --> 11:37:07,380
that, like, you're

10366
11:37:07,380 --> 11:37:09,380
like, so successful is because I got you that

10367
11:37:09,380 --> 11:37:11,380
Xbox, isn't it? And I'm like, yeah, dad, yeah!

10368
11:37:11,380 --> 11:37:13,380
Yeah, you made me cool, dad!

10369
11:37:13,380 --> 11:37:15,380
Yeah! Like, we're hyping each other up.

10370
11:37:15,380 --> 11:37:17,380
And I'm like, yeah!

10371
11:37:17,380 --> 11:37:19,380
Um...

10372
11:37:19,380 --> 11:37:21,380
I was, like, really cute.

10373
11:37:21,380 --> 11:37:23,380
No, my dad's, like, such a good

10374
11:37:23,380 --> 11:37:25,380
sport about everything.

10375
11:37:25,380 --> 11:37:27,380
Um...

10376
11:37:27,380 --> 11:37:29,380
Like, we're gonna do an interview.

10377
11:37:29,380 --> 11:37:31,380
Um, and he knows

10378
11:37:31,380 --> 11:37:33,380
about, like, Vila and that.

10379
11:37:33,380 --> 11:37:35,380
Um, he was like, how did it go?

10380
11:37:35,380 --> 11:37:37,380
And I was like, dad, dad!

10381
11:37:37,380 --> 11:37:39,380
Almost 3,000 people watched

10382
11:37:39,380 --> 11:37:41,380
me at once in one stream type thing.

10383
11:37:41,380 --> 11:37:43,380
Um, and he's like, is that

10384
11:37:43,380 --> 11:37:45,380
good? And I'm like, it's way beyond my

10385
11:37:45,380 --> 11:37:47,380
world! The streams, all the girls did

10386
11:37:47,380 --> 11:37:49,380
amazing! And he was like, oh, I'm so

10387
11:37:49,380 --> 11:37:51,380
glad you're girls are nice to me. And my mom

10388
11:37:51,380 --> 11:37:53,380
as well.

10389
11:37:53,380 --> 11:37:55,380
My mom really likes the girls.

10390
11:37:55,380 --> 11:37:57,380
Never spoken to them.

10391
11:37:57,380 --> 11:37:59,380
They've never interacted. But my mom's

10392
11:37:59,380 --> 11:38:01,380
like, oh, I love

10393
11:38:01,380 --> 11:38:03,380
your girls so much. They're so...

10394
11:38:03,380 --> 11:38:05,380
Like, send me their links. I want to hear their voices.

10395
11:38:05,380 --> 11:38:07,380
They send me, like, all this.

10396
11:38:07,380 --> 11:38:09,380
Like, it's so cute. It's just really nice.

10397
11:38:09,380 --> 11:38:11,380
Um...

10398
11:38:11,380 --> 11:38:13,380
Hopefully it doesn't feel like I'm, like,

10399
11:38:13,380 --> 11:38:15,380
rubbing it in anyone's faces

10400
11:38:15,380 --> 11:38:17,380
if they maybe have parents that are not

10401
11:38:17,380 --> 11:38:19,380
quite so understanding.

10402
11:38:19,380 --> 11:38:21,380
Uh...

10403
11:38:21,380 --> 11:38:23,380
I really don't want it to sting

10404
11:38:23,380 --> 11:38:25,380
if I talk about the subject, but I'll

10405
11:38:25,380 --> 11:38:27,380
move on and we'll

10406
11:38:27,380 --> 11:38:29,380
see what we're dealing with next. We're going to

10407
11:38:29,380 --> 11:38:31,380
arrow storm here because

10408
11:38:31,380 --> 11:38:33,380
we need to unlock

10409
11:38:33,380 --> 11:38:35,380
the

10410
11:38:35,380 --> 11:38:37,380
Assassin's Upgrade.

10411
11:38:37,380 --> 11:38:39,380
We're, uh, right.

10412
11:38:39,380 --> 11:38:41,380
We're trying by this building. How much time

10413
11:38:41,380 --> 11:38:43,380
have I got? We've got, like,

10414
11:38:43,380 --> 11:38:45,380
a cut in it quick.

10415
11:38:45,380 --> 11:38:47,380
Meracy's not online anymore, is she?

10416
11:38:49,380 --> 11:38:51,380
Is anyone from Ymir? Oh,

10417
11:38:51,380 --> 11:38:53,380
I don't want to do that. Please leave me alone. I'm not doing that mission.

10418
11:38:57,380 --> 11:38:59,380
Meracy's still on. Um, can someone

10419
11:38:59,380 --> 11:39:01,380
be a kind soul and say

10420
11:39:01,380 --> 11:39:03,380
Strone's asking if you're still

10421
11:39:03,380 --> 11:39:05,380
going to be online in 20 minutes?

10422
11:39:05,380 --> 11:39:07,380
Uh...

10423
11:39:07,380 --> 11:39:09,380
She should redirect into you or not?

10424
11:39:09,380 --> 11:39:11,380
Um, and then

10425
11:39:11,380 --> 11:39:13,380
get back to me if she's still...

10426
11:39:13,380 --> 11:39:15,380
if she's still doing it or not.

10427
11:39:15,380 --> 11:39:17,380
We're just going to buy these expensive things now.

10428
11:39:17,380 --> 11:39:19,380
Um...

10429
11:39:19,380 --> 11:39:21,380
They're so... they take such a big

10430
11:39:21,380 --> 11:39:23,380
chunk of the money, though.

10431
11:39:23,380 --> 11:39:25,380
Literally, I'm back to 32.

10432
11:39:25,380 --> 11:39:27,380
I think I'm going to have to send my recruits on missions

10433
11:39:27,380 --> 11:39:29,380
again.

10434
11:39:29,380 --> 11:39:31,380
Just came back from Shum. Ain't no way she's still going.

10435
11:39:31,380 --> 11:39:33,380
Ah, yeah.

10436
11:39:33,380 --> 11:39:35,380
Uh, the only reason

10437
11:39:35,380 --> 11:39:37,380
I'm going offline in 20 minutes

10438
11:39:37,380 --> 11:39:39,380
is because of the VOD issues.

10439
11:39:39,380 --> 11:39:41,380
If there was no VOD issues,

10440
11:39:41,380 --> 11:39:43,380
we would be doing Leonardo's

10441
11:39:43,380 --> 11:39:45,380
missions right now.

10442
11:39:45,380 --> 11:39:47,380
Right now!

10443
11:39:47,380 --> 11:39:49,380
Right now! Uh, I'm serious when I say that.

10444
11:39:49,380 --> 11:39:51,380
We'd be on Leonardo. We'd be in

10445
11:39:51,380 --> 11:39:53,380
a tank right now. We'd be on a

10446
11:39:53,380 --> 11:39:55,380
paraglider. Okay?

10447
11:39:55,380 --> 11:39:57,380
But no.

10448
11:39:57,380 --> 11:39:59,380
No, no, no. Had to...

10449
11:39:59,380 --> 11:40:01,380
Had to have VOD issues.

10450
11:40:01,380 --> 11:40:03,380
Yeah, yeah.

10451
11:40:03,380 --> 11:40:05,380
Right, let's level up these

10452
11:40:05,380 --> 11:40:07,380
assassinos.

10453
11:40:07,380 --> 11:40:09,380
Mm, mm, mm, mm, mm, mm.

10454
11:40:09,380 --> 11:40:11,380
We've got quite a lot

10455
11:40:11,380 --> 11:40:13,380
of level 8s. We can probably

10456
11:40:13,380 --> 11:40:15,380
do quite dangerous

10457
11:40:15,380 --> 11:40:17,380
missions. I'll send...

10458
11:40:17,380 --> 11:40:19,380
No, I won't. I'll send

10459
11:40:19,380 --> 11:40:21,380
two 7s

10460
11:40:21,380 --> 11:40:23,380
away together.

10461
11:40:23,380 --> 11:40:25,380
I've got a big one. More 8s.

10462
11:40:25,380 --> 11:40:27,380
One, two, three, four, five.

10463
11:40:27,380 --> 11:40:29,380
Oh, you're not even fully successful now.

10464
11:40:29,380 --> 11:40:31,380
I don't want to risk it. I'll send the 8s

10465
11:40:31,380 --> 11:40:33,380
on...

10466
11:40:33,380 --> 11:40:35,380
Yeah, that'll be fine.

10467
11:40:35,380 --> 11:40:37,380
I'm literally have no worries that

10468
11:40:37,380 --> 11:40:39,380
they're going to survive.

10469
11:40:39,380 --> 11:40:41,380
Mm, yeah. I was kind of into

10470
11:40:41,380 --> 11:40:43,380
that awkward levelling upstage

10471
11:40:43,380 --> 11:40:45,380
where...

10472
11:40:45,380 --> 11:40:47,380
I'm not wasting time sending

10473
11:40:47,380 --> 11:40:49,380
them together, but

10474
11:40:49,380 --> 11:40:51,380
it would be nice

10475
11:40:51,380 --> 11:40:53,380
to get the strength to, like, go on

10476
11:40:53,380 --> 11:40:55,380
their own.

10477
11:40:55,380 --> 11:40:57,380
YouTube, give us YouTube take away.

10478
11:40:57,380 --> 11:40:59,380
YouTube can stop me. Literally

10479
11:40:59,380 --> 11:41:01,380
if I would do 14 hours,

10480
11:41:01,380 --> 11:41:03,380
I would be doing Leonardo,

10481
11:41:03,380 --> 11:41:05,380
and then I would be pretty

10482
11:41:05,380 --> 11:41:07,380
satisfied. Maybe the auditory

10483
11:41:07,380 --> 11:41:09,380
memories and Christina memory, because

10484
11:41:09,380 --> 11:41:11,380
that's actually really quick as well.

10485
11:41:11,380 --> 11:41:13,380
Um,

10486
11:41:13,380 --> 11:41:15,380
I honestly would love to say

10487
11:41:15,380 --> 11:41:17,380
I'll make a second stream room, but

10488
11:41:17,380 --> 11:41:19,380
I do have those 8s in my collabs

10489
11:41:19,380 --> 11:41:21,380
and those clips to get

10490
11:41:21,380 --> 11:41:23,380
clipped and edited and that.

10491
11:41:23,380 --> 11:41:25,380
Oh, I can't believe it. I have responsibility.

10492
11:41:25,380 --> 11:41:27,380
Who would have imagined

10493
11:41:27,380 --> 11:41:29,380
that spawning a VTuber agency

10494
11:41:29,380 --> 11:41:31,380
meant I have responsibilities?

10495
11:41:31,380 --> 11:41:33,380
Oh! Oh!

10496
11:41:33,380 --> 11:41:35,380
Truly a shit. Please, excuse me, sir.

10497
11:41:35,380 --> 11:41:37,380
Um...

10498
11:41:37,380 --> 11:41:39,380
Oh, what is that? What is it?

10499
11:41:39,380 --> 11:41:41,380
Uh, right.

10500
11:41:41,380 --> 11:41:43,380
Um, I don't think I have enough money

10501
11:41:43,380 --> 11:41:45,380
for, like, anything

10502
11:41:45,380 --> 11:41:47,380
else.

10503
11:41:47,380 --> 11:41:49,380
Wait, how much money do I have

10504
11:41:49,380 --> 11:41:51,380
on my persons?

10505
11:41:51,380 --> 11:41:53,380
13K, that's not enough

10506
11:41:53,380 --> 11:41:55,380
to do anything else.

10507
11:41:57,380 --> 11:41:59,380
We'll arrive at work any day.

10508
11:41:59,380 --> 11:42:01,380
Can't wait for the birthday placer.

10509
11:42:01,380 --> 11:42:03,380
Can't wait for yapping 2.0, where I

10510
11:42:03,380 --> 11:42:05,380
regurgitate all the information. Maybe

10511
11:42:05,380 --> 11:42:07,380
I should look at the development

10512
11:42:07,380 --> 11:42:09,380
behind the scenes and then I can tell you about

10513
11:42:09,380 --> 11:42:11,380
the development behind the scenes.

10514
11:42:11,380 --> 11:42:13,380
That would be interesting too. What time are we

10515
11:42:13,380 --> 11:42:15,380
at? I've got 20 minutes.

10516
11:42:15,380 --> 11:42:17,380
Maybe the bank will...

10517
11:42:17,380 --> 11:42:19,380
Hmm...

10518
11:42:19,380 --> 11:42:21,380
Hmm...

10519
11:42:21,380 --> 11:42:23,380
Right, let's do Christina.

10520
11:42:23,380 --> 11:42:25,380
Let's do Christina. We've got time.

10521
11:42:25,380 --> 11:42:27,380
It doesn't take 20 minutes to do her.

10522
11:42:27,380 --> 11:42:29,380
Oh!

10523
11:42:29,380 --> 11:42:31,380
That's what she said.

10524
11:42:35,380 --> 11:42:37,380
I don't know if we'll finish

10525
11:42:37,380 --> 11:42:39,380
her storyline. I believe she has

10526
11:42:39,380 --> 11:42:41,380
three missions and the last

10527
11:42:41,380 --> 11:42:43,380
mission is a punch out.

10528
11:42:43,380 --> 11:42:45,380
Punch out?

10529
11:42:45,380 --> 11:42:47,380
But we'll do

10530
11:42:47,380 --> 11:42:49,380
a? Ah, Christina.

10531
11:42:49,380 --> 11:42:51,380
Christina mission.

10532
11:42:51,380 --> 11:42:53,380
I'm claiming

10533
11:42:53,380 --> 11:42:55,380
the building.

10534
11:42:55,380 --> 11:42:57,380
Claim me, claim me, claim me.

10535
11:42:57,380 --> 11:42:59,380
Best I can do is do.

10536
11:42:59,380 --> 11:43:01,380
Doesn't take to it.

10537
11:43:01,380 --> 11:43:03,380
Just like,

10538
11:43:03,380 --> 11:43:05,380
nevermind. I know, I know.

10539
11:43:05,380 --> 11:43:07,380
I make it too easy. I don't even

10540
11:43:07,380 --> 11:43:09,380
mean it. If I do it, I don't

10541
11:43:09,380 --> 11:43:11,380
mean it, but if I do it to you

10542
11:43:11,380 --> 11:43:13,380
then I mean it.

10543
11:43:13,380 --> 11:43:15,380
Oh, look how much my armor

10544
11:43:15,380 --> 11:43:17,380
but my health bar went up. I just

10545
11:43:17,380 --> 11:43:19,380
like, literally noticed that.

10546
11:43:19,380 --> 11:43:21,380
How did I not notice that?

10547
11:43:21,380 --> 11:43:23,380
Cause it's massive.

10548
11:43:25,380 --> 11:43:27,380
It's like halfway across. It's like

10549
11:43:27,380 --> 11:43:29,380
the Elden Ring.

10550
11:43:29,380 --> 11:43:31,380
Oh!

10551
11:43:31,380 --> 11:43:33,380
Okay, we're getting stole. I see the

10552
11:43:33,380 --> 11:43:35,380
game is trying to stall me from

10553
11:43:35,380 --> 11:43:37,380
achieving my...

10554
11:43:37,380 --> 11:43:39,380
Jesus, that's brutal.

10555
11:43:39,380 --> 11:43:41,380
Oh, that's brutal.

10556
11:43:41,380 --> 11:43:43,380
Oh, that's brutal.

10557
11:43:43,380 --> 11:43:45,380
Is that a new knife as well?

10558
11:43:45,380 --> 11:43:47,380
I must have unlocked a new knife

10559
11:43:47,380 --> 11:43:49,380
cause, yeah, this must be a

10560
11:43:49,380 --> 11:43:51,380
Romuli knife. A Romulus knife.

10561
11:43:51,380 --> 11:43:53,380
Cause I, that does not look like

10562
11:43:53,380 --> 11:43:55,380
the default knife.

10563
11:43:55,380 --> 11:43:57,380
Yeah, with the hook.

10564
11:43:57,380 --> 11:43:59,380
Excuse me, pardon me, coming through.

10565
11:43:59,380 --> 11:44:01,380
Tihi! Tihi, I'm just

10566
11:44:01,380 --> 11:44:03,380
the normal average citizen.

10567
11:44:03,380 --> 11:44:05,380
Christina!

10568
11:44:05,380 --> 11:44:07,380
My love!

10569
11:44:07,380 --> 11:44:09,380
Hello!

10570
11:44:13,380 --> 11:44:15,380
We'll be climbing a coast with this

10571
11:44:15,380 --> 11:44:17,380
mission.

10572
11:44:17,380 --> 11:44:19,380
Does it

10573
11:44:19,380 --> 11:44:21,380
vaude explode after the 12 hour

10574
11:44:21,380 --> 11:44:23,380
mark or is it like

10575
11:44:23,380 --> 11:44:25,380
it gives a few minutes of grace

10576
11:44:25,380 --> 11:44:27,380
unironically? Cause I'm worried

10577
11:44:27,380 --> 11:44:29,380
about it exploding.

10578
11:44:29,380 --> 11:44:31,380
Ha ha!

10579
11:44:35,380 --> 11:44:37,380
This doesn't take long, it's a punch out.

10580
11:44:37,380 --> 11:44:39,380
What about that one?

10581
11:44:39,380 --> 11:44:41,380
That's my brother!

10582
11:44:45,380 --> 11:44:47,380
This is baby, it's healing.

10583
11:44:59,380 --> 11:45:01,380
I think it explodes right after

10584
11:45:01,380 --> 11:45:03,380
12 hours.

10585
11:45:05,380 --> 11:45:07,380
What?

10586
11:45:07,380 --> 11:45:09,380
What?

10587
11:45:09,380 --> 11:45:11,380
Why are you just standing there?

10588
11:45:11,380 --> 11:45:13,380
Oh, um,

10589
11:45:13,380 --> 11:45:15,380
because I

10590
11:45:15,380 --> 11:45:17,380
wanted to ask you

10591
11:45:17,380 --> 11:45:19,380
which is

10592
11:45:19,380 --> 11:45:21,380
what's your name?

10593
11:45:21,380 --> 11:45:23,380
Not one you'll ever meet me

10594
11:45:23,380 --> 11:45:25,380
without.

10595
11:45:25,380 --> 11:45:27,380
I wasn't ready.

10596
11:45:27,380 --> 11:45:29,380
I'm planning on being really charming.

10597
11:45:31,380 --> 11:45:33,380
Negative riz.

10598
11:45:47,380 --> 11:45:49,380
Whoa!

10599
11:45:49,380 --> 11:45:51,380
I have terrible news, please do not

10600
11:45:51,380 --> 11:45:53,380
take the advice of Ezio.

10601
11:45:53,380 --> 11:45:55,380
Do not ever follow a woman home.

10602
11:45:55,380 --> 11:45:57,380
That's not

10603
11:45:57,380 --> 11:45:59,380
socially acceptable.

10604
11:45:59,380 --> 11:46:01,380
Don't worry, I'll teach you what's

10605
11:46:01,380 --> 11:46:03,380
socially acceptable and what's not.

10606
11:46:03,380 --> 11:46:05,380
If you approach a woman

10607
11:46:05,380 --> 11:46:07,380
and then

10608
11:46:07,380 --> 11:46:09,380
she, you know,

10609
11:46:09,380 --> 11:46:11,380
doesn't reciprocate interest,

10610
11:46:11,380 --> 11:46:13,380
do not follow

10611
11:46:13,380 --> 11:46:15,380
a woman home. That is no-no

10612
11:46:15,380 --> 11:46:17,380
in society.

10613
11:46:17,380 --> 11:46:19,380
More societal,

10614
11:46:19,380 --> 11:46:21,380
social...

10615
11:46:21,380 --> 11:46:23,380
Oh! See?

10616
11:46:25,380 --> 11:46:27,380
Wait, get back here.

10617
11:46:27,380 --> 11:46:29,380
Oh my god, she wants me for real, for real.

10618
11:46:29,380 --> 11:46:31,380
That's how you get a restraining order.

10619
11:46:31,380 --> 11:46:33,380
Yeah, this is...

10620
11:46:33,380 --> 11:46:35,380
I understand it's a video game,

10621
11:46:35,380 --> 11:46:37,380
but

10622
11:46:37,380 --> 11:46:39,380
this is...

10623
11:46:39,380 --> 11:46:41,380
Yeah.

10624
11:46:43,380 --> 11:46:45,380
Yeah, this is...

10625
11:46:47,380 --> 11:46:49,380
Yeah, this is...

10626
11:46:51,380 --> 11:46:53,380
something alright.

10627
11:46:55,380 --> 11:46:57,380
Like,

10628
11:46:57,380 --> 11:46:59,380
I know Ezio's harmless,

10629
11:46:59,380 --> 11:47:01,380
but this is... it's given, like,

10630
11:47:01,380 --> 11:47:03,380
yandere simulator or something.

10631
11:47:05,380 --> 11:47:07,380
Like, that kind of negative thing.

10632
11:47:09,380 --> 11:47:11,380
Restraining order speed run for real.

10633
11:47:13,380 --> 11:47:15,380
The best thing you think of to get around 12-hour

10634
11:47:15,380 --> 11:47:17,380
problem is to close the stream when you...

10635
11:47:17,380 --> 11:47:19,380
Oh, I wasn't paying attention, sorry, I was reading chat.

10636
11:47:19,380 --> 11:47:21,380
12-hour problem is

10637
11:47:21,380 --> 11:47:23,380
to close...

10638
11:47:23,380 --> 11:47:25,380
to close

10639
11:47:25,380 --> 11:47:27,380
the stream when you have to take a long

10640
11:47:27,380 --> 11:47:29,380
break and start a new one after.

10641
11:47:29,380 --> 11:47:31,380
Okay.

10642
11:47:31,380 --> 11:47:33,380
Do you mean, like, actually go offline and rest

10643
11:47:33,380 --> 11:47:35,380
and then come back online again? Is that your solution

10644
11:47:35,380 --> 11:47:37,380
to my 12-hour stream problem?

10645
11:47:39,380 --> 11:47:41,380
Instruction's unclear, I'm hiding in her closet.

10646
11:47:41,380 --> 11:47:43,380
Oh!

10647
11:47:43,380 --> 11:47:45,380
That's terrible!

10648
11:47:45,380 --> 11:47:47,380
You're not to make those jokes!

10649
11:47:47,380 --> 11:47:49,380
That's naughty!

10650
11:47:49,380 --> 11:47:51,380
Oh.

10651
11:47:51,380 --> 11:47:53,380
Okay, this quest has taken

10652
11:47:53,380 --> 11:47:55,380
a bit longer than I originally anticipated.

10653
11:47:59,380 --> 11:48:01,380
But I think we're about to do the fighting

10654
11:48:01,380 --> 11:48:03,380
part and then we're done.

10655
11:48:03,380 --> 11:48:05,380
You achieved 100%

10656
11:48:05,380 --> 11:48:07,380
in problem

10657
11:48:07,380 --> 11:48:09,380
solving.

10658
11:48:09,380 --> 11:48:11,380
Okay, we're here, we're here, we end this.

10659
11:48:13,380 --> 11:48:15,380
We hate him!

10660
11:48:21,380 --> 11:48:23,380
I think not, I'm already here.

10661
11:48:23,380 --> 11:48:25,380
I've decided, I'm tired

10662
11:48:25,380 --> 11:48:27,380
of waiting for you to open your legs

10663
11:48:27,380 --> 11:48:29,380
on your own.

10664
11:48:37,380 --> 11:48:39,380
Oh, the area, I thought his name was Duccio

10665
11:48:39,380 --> 11:48:41,380
for some reason.

10666
11:48:41,380 --> 11:48:43,380
Oh my god, we're the knight in

10667
11:48:43,380 --> 11:48:45,380
training armor, we're not creepy anymore

10668
11:48:45,380 --> 11:48:47,380
because we're saving her.

10669
11:48:47,380 --> 11:48:49,380
Take this!

10670
11:48:49,380 --> 11:48:51,380
Leave the lady alone!

10671
11:48:59,380 --> 11:49:01,380
Thank you.

10672
11:49:01,380 --> 11:49:03,380
That was very kind of you.

10673
11:49:03,380 --> 11:49:05,380
Are you alright?

10674
11:49:05,380 --> 11:49:07,380
Not only is her...

10675
11:49:07,380 --> 11:49:09,380
I'm sorry.

10676
11:49:15,380 --> 11:49:17,380
He looks like such a baby there, honestly.

10677
11:49:17,380 --> 11:49:19,380
Looks like you got yourself a second chance.

10678
11:49:23,380 --> 11:49:25,380
If she kisses and not even

10679
11:49:25,380 --> 11:49:27,380
on the first date,

10680
11:49:27,380 --> 11:49:29,380
we're in, lads.

10681
11:49:29,380 --> 11:49:31,380
We're in, lads.

10682
11:49:31,380 --> 11:49:33,380
We are in.

10683
11:49:35,380 --> 11:49:37,380
You stalking wha- No!

10684
11:49:37,380 --> 11:49:39,380
No!

10685
11:49:39,380 --> 11:49:41,380
Absolutely not!

10686
11:49:43,380 --> 11:49:45,380
Absolutely not!

10687
11:49:45,380 --> 11:49:47,380
This is fictional game.

10688
11:49:47,380 --> 11:49:49,380
Literally when you build up the game,

10689
11:49:49,380 --> 11:49:51,380
it says fiction.

10690
11:49:51,380 --> 11:49:53,380
Okay, I think

10691
11:49:53,380 --> 11:49:55,380
I'm gonna have to close the game there

10692
11:49:55,380 --> 11:49:57,380
because the void

10693
11:49:57,380 --> 11:49:59,380
is literally about to explode.

10694
11:49:59,380 --> 11:50:01,380
Did you guys tell me if

10695
11:50:01,380 --> 11:50:03,380
Mercy is still strumming?

10696
11:50:03,380 --> 11:50:05,380
They'll be strumming her in a minute.

10697
11:50:05,380 --> 11:50:07,380
Stop!

10698
11:50:07,380 --> 11:50:09,380
Stop.

10699
11:50:09,380 --> 11:50:11,380
Unappropriate.

10700
11:50:11,380 --> 11:50:13,380
No HR though.

10701
11:50:13,380 --> 11:50:15,380
Mercy is still on.

10702
11:50:15,380 --> 11:50:17,380
She's still gonna keep playing.

10703
11:50:17,380 --> 11:50:19,380
She's still gonna...

10704
11:50:19,380 --> 11:50:21,380
Remember that time donations were on?

10705
11:50:21,380 --> 11:50:23,380
And then you guys broke the donations so badly

10706
11:50:23,380 --> 11:50:25,380
that no one in Vehler can get donated to right now?

10707
11:50:25,380 --> 11:50:27,380
Because you guys were so supportive.

10708
11:50:27,380 --> 11:50:29,380
Yeah, she's still yapping.

10709
11:50:29,380 --> 11:50:31,380
She's post-game yapping.

10710
11:50:31,380 --> 11:50:33,380
Alright, well...

10711
11:50:35,380 --> 11:50:37,380
I'm gonna get her link.

10712
11:50:37,380 --> 11:50:39,380
Mercy, can I get your link?

10713
11:50:39,380 --> 11:50:41,380
Mercy, can I get your link?

10714
11:50:41,380 --> 11:50:43,380
Mercy, can I get your link?

10715
11:50:43,380 --> 11:50:45,380
That's how I spell Mercy Modest.

10716
11:50:45,380 --> 11:50:47,380
That's right.

10717
11:50:47,380 --> 11:50:49,380
What are you gonna do about it?

10718
11:50:49,380 --> 11:50:51,380
Are you gonna fart?

10719
11:50:51,380 --> 11:50:53,380
Yeah, that's right.

10720
11:50:53,380 --> 11:50:55,380
You're not gonna fart.

10721
11:50:55,380 --> 11:50:57,380
You're gonna do nothing about it.

10722
11:50:57,380 --> 11:50:59,380
Come on.

10723
11:50:59,380 --> 11:51:01,380
Stop it!

10724
11:51:01,380 --> 11:51:03,380
Analytics? No, wrong one.

10725
11:51:03,380 --> 11:51:05,380
Details. Customization.

10726
11:51:05,380 --> 11:51:07,380
Redirect.

10727
11:51:07,380 --> 11:51:09,380
I'm gonna link right in there.

10728
11:51:09,380 --> 11:51:11,380
Save.

10729
11:51:11,380 --> 11:51:13,380
Okay, when I end, it should redirect

10730
11:51:13,380 --> 11:51:15,380
into...

10731
11:51:15,380 --> 11:51:17,380
this encyclopedia

10732
11:51:17,380 --> 11:51:19,380
of Would You Want to Quit the Game?

10733
11:51:19,380 --> 11:51:21,380
Righty-hoo!

10734
11:51:21,380 --> 11:51:23,380
Should I go bigger?

10735
11:51:25,380 --> 11:51:27,380
Hold on a minute.

10736
11:51:29,380 --> 11:51:31,380
Why is chat wrong?

10737
11:51:31,380 --> 11:51:33,380
Chat isn't disabled!

10738
11:51:37,380 --> 11:51:39,380
Well...

10739
11:51:39,380 --> 11:51:41,380
What is this?

10740
11:51:41,380 --> 11:51:43,380
Why the heck?

10741
11:51:43,380 --> 11:51:45,380
You know what?

10742
11:51:45,380 --> 11:51:47,380
I'll just stand here then.

10743
11:51:47,380 --> 11:51:49,380
Hi!

10744
11:51:49,380 --> 11:51:51,380
I say hi

10745
11:51:51,380 --> 11:51:53,380
if we're not all about to go a bit.

10746
11:51:53,380 --> 11:51:55,380
Thank you all so much

10747
11:51:55,380 --> 11:51:57,380
for letting me go

10748
11:51:57,380 --> 11:51:59,380
turbo mode on this game.

10749
11:51:59,380 --> 11:52:01,380
It has been nothing short of a pleasure

10750
11:52:01,380 --> 11:52:03,380
and I hope

10751
11:52:03,380 --> 11:52:05,380
we can 100%

10752
11:52:05,380 --> 11:52:07,380
tomorrow.

10753
11:52:07,380 --> 11:52:09,380
I don't know what the tank mission is.

10754
11:52:09,380 --> 11:52:11,380
I don't know if I should look it up

10755
11:52:11,380 --> 11:52:13,380
or if I should just

10756
11:52:13,380 --> 11:52:15,380
wish myself good luck on the tank.

10757
11:52:15,380 --> 11:52:17,380
But yes.

10758
11:52:17,380 --> 11:52:19,380
Thank you for hanging.

10759
11:52:19,380 --> 11:52:21,380
Please don't worry if you weren't here for the full thing.

10760
11:52:21,380 --> 11:52:23,380
I don't think anyone was here for the full thing

10761
11:52:23,380 --> 11:52:25,380
other than me.

10762
11:52:25,380 --> 11:52:27,380
Please.

10763
11:52:27,380 --> 11:52:29,380
I miss her already!

10764
11:52:29,380 --> 11:52:31,380
I'm still talking!

10765
11:52:31,380 --> 11:52:33,380
Have I even gone yet?

10766
11:52:33,380 --> 11:52:35,380
We are 52 minutes

10767
11:52:35,380 --> 11:52:37,380
so less than 7 minutes.

10768
11:52:37,380 --> 11:52:39,380
I'm stinky.

10769
11:52:39,380 --> 11:52:41,380
I'm going to end it

10770
11:52:41,380 --> 11:52:43,380
so it can successfully raid into Mercy.

10771
11:52:43,380 --> 11:52:45,380
But thank you so much

10772
11:52:45,380 --> 11:52:47,380
for keeping me company.

10773
11:52:47,380 --> 11:52:49,380
I'm so glad I got to share one of the...

10774
11:52:49,380 --> 11:52:51,380
one of the? No.

10775
11:52:51,380 --> 11:52:53,380
The greatest game

10776
11:52:53,380 --> 11:52:55,380
of all time.

10777
11:52:55,380 --> 11:52:57,380
I have no idea how long tomorrow

10778
11:52:57,380 --> 11:52:59,380
the stream is going to be.

10779
11:52:59,380 --> 11:53:01,380
But really

10780
11:53:01,380 --> 11:53:03,380
we pretty much done everything other than

10781
11:53:03,380 --> 11:53:05,380
Leonardo missions and then we just go back

10782
11:53:05,380 --> 11:53:07,380
in the DNA sequences

10783
11:53:07,380 --> 11:53:09,380
of the chapters we messed up

10784
11:53:09,380 --> 11:53:11,380
and by we messed up I messed up

10785
11:53:11,380 --> 11:53:13,380
but I'm putting the blame on the both of us.

10786
11:53:13,380 --> 11:53:15,380
Okay?

10787
11:53:15,380 --> 11:53:17,380
Um...

10788
11:53:17,380 --> 11:53:19,380
Can you give us a peek at those eyes before you hop off

10789
11:53:19,380 --> 11:53:21,380
as encouragement for showing up?

10790
11:53:21,380 --> 11:53:23,380
Oh go go go! I like it.

10791
11:53:23,380 --> 11:53:25,380
I dig it. Ah, new subscriber

10792
11:53:25,380 --> 11:53:27,380
you're in the way.

10793
11:53:27,380 --> 11:53:29,380
You're such a silly goober up there, new subscriber.

10794
11:53:29,380 --> 11:53:31,380
How do I get rid of you?

10795
11:53:31,380 --> 11:53:33,380
Just for now.

10796
11:53:33,380 --> 11:53:35,380
Okay.

10797
11:53:35,380 --> 11:53:37,380
You ready?

10798
11:53:37,380 --> 11:53:39,380
Even though my Assassin's Creed sounds are still

10799
11:53:39,380 --> 11:53:41,380
in the background? Just pretend the backing

10800
11:53:41,380 --> 11:53:43,380
track to the menu of Assassin's Creed

10801
11:53:43,380 --> 11:53:45,380
is Hypnosis space, okay?

10802
11:53:45,380 --> 11:53:47,380
Wow.

10803
11:53:47,380 --> 11:53:49,380
You want to come to stream tomorrow, don't you?

10804
11:53:51,380 --> 11:53:53,380
I'll be waiting.

10805
11:53:53,380 --> 11:53:55,380
And you've done very well today.

10806
11:53:55,380 --> 11:53:57,380
Holding on for

10807
11:53:57,380 --> 11:53:59,380
too long.

10808
11:53:59,380 --> 11:54:01,380
Can you do it again

10809
11:54:01,380 --> 11:54:03,380
tomorrow for me?

10810
11:54:03,380 --> 11:54:05,380
Yeah?

10811
11:54:05,380 --> 11:54:07,380
Fine then.

10812
11:54:07,380 --> 11:54:09,380
I'll see you tomorrow.

10813
11:54:09,380 --> 11:54:11,380
Nya!

10814
11:54:11,380 --> 11:54:13,380
But for now

10815
11:54:13,380 --> 11:54:15,380
you can meme in me, okay?

10816
11:54:15,380 --> 11:54:17,380
You can meme in me.

10817
11:54:17,380 --> 11:54:19,380
Okay.

10818
11:54:19,380 --> 11:54:21,380
Thank you so so much.

10819
11:54:21,380 --> 11:54:23,380
We're gonna go to Mercy.

10820
11:54:23,380 --> 11:54:25,380
Should have picked

10821
11:54:25,380 --> 11:54:27,380
any kind of support.

10822
11:54:27,380 --> 11:54:29,380
Right. I love you so so much, Reflings.

10823
11:54:29,380 --> 11:54:31,380
And if you're not Reflinging

10824
11:54:31,380 --> 11:54:33,380
don't worry, I still love you too

10825
11:54:33,380 --> 11:54:35,380
because I'm really appreciate you hanging out.

10826
11:54:35,380 --> 11:54:37,380
I know some people don't like being referred to

10827
11:54:37,380 --> 11:54:39,380
as Fannins, but I like Reflings.

10828
11:54:39,380 --> 11:54:41,380
No.

10829
11:54:41,380 --> 11:54:43,380
Not that.

10830
11:54:43,380 --> 11:54:45,380
Reflings.

10831
11:54:49,380 --> 11:54:51,380
I'll see you tomorrow.

10832
11:54:51,380 --> 11:54:53,380
Bye bye. I go sleep and brush my teeth.

10833
11:54:53,380 --> 11:54:55,380
No, I brush my teeth first and then I go sleep.

10834
11:54:55,380 --> 11:54:57,380
But first,

10835
11:54:57,380 --> 11:54:59,380
Mercy.

10836
11:54:59,380 --> 11:55:01,380
I'll then brush teeth.
