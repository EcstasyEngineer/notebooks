WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:17.240
I was trying to speedrun up in the stream started and the game.

00:17.240 --> 00:23.720
This game crashes so heckin' easily and it literally just crashed there.

00:23.720 --> 00:24.720
Praying it works.

00:25.720 --> 00:26.720
Praying it works.

00:26.720 --> 00:29.720
But good morning, good evening, and good afternoon.

00:29.720 --> 00:34.720
Oui, today my screen has gone black so hopefully I'm still streaming.

00:34.720 --> 00:36.720
Oh my god.

00:36.720 --> 00:39.720
Right, this game breaks.

00:39.720 --> 00:41.720
Oh, I think it's about to break again.

00:41.720 --> 00:42.720
No way.

00:43.720 --> 00:45.720
Oh, this game breaks so easily.

00:47.720 --> 00:48.720
Oh, don't break, don't break.

00:48.720 --> 00:50.720
Oh, my screen's black again.

00:51.720 --> 00:52.720
What?

00:53.720 --> 00:57.720
This game breaks so easily.

00:57.720 --> 01:02.720
I think this is like 2007 maybe?

01:02.720 --> 01:04.720
But goodness me.

01:05.720 --> 01:07.720
Good morning, good evening, good afternoon.

01:07.720 --> 01:12.720
Oui, we are playing yet again, surprise surprise, another childhood game.

01:12.720 --> 01:13.720
Wait, what?

01:13.720 --> 01:15.720
Oh, it's 2009.

01:15.720 --> 01:19.720
It says James Cameron's Avatar game 2009.

01:19.720 --> 01:32.720
So I played this game as a little sheriff and is there a girl that's white with black hair?

01:32.720 --> 01:35.720
Well, I'm not blonde.

01:37.720 --> 01:38.720
I'm not.

01:39.720 --> 01:40.720
Well, we just did that.

01:40.720 --> 01:42.720
Right, we're blonde with green eyes today.

01:42.720 --> 01:43.720
Yippee.

01:45.720 --> 01:46.720
So this game.

01:46.720 --> 01:49.720
Okay, now let's enter first name.

01:49.720 --> 01:50.720
Squiddles.

01:53.720 --> 01:54.720
Squiddly.

01:54.720 --> 01:56.720
I'm feeling a bit squiddly-diddly the day about.

01:56.720 --> 01:58.720
I bet you'd like that, wouldn't you?

01:59.720 --> 02:01.720
I had no idea they even released the game back then.

02:01.720 --> 02:06.720
Oh, this game is, I wrote.

02:06.720 --> 02:12.720
I'll shush until the campaign part, but they much to the campaign.

02:12.720 --> 02:14.720
Let me, it got slapped together.

02:14.720 --> 02:15.720
Let me tell you that much.

02:15.720 --> 02:17.720
I got slapped together.

02:23.720 --> 02:27.720
So I am a big enthusiast of Avatar.

02:27.720 --> 02:31.720
I absolutely enjoy the movies to the highest of heavens.

02:32.720 --> 02:33.720
Cut.

02:36.720 --> 02:39.720
Oh my God, I've not played this in years.

02:43.720 --> 02:45.720
Oh, look, it's us.

02:45.720 --> 02:47.720
Sigourney Weaver.

02:55.720 --> 02:57.720
Big Sigourney Weaver, where you been?

02:57.720 --> 02:59.720
We've missed you, Sigourney.

03:02.720 --> 03:04.720
Don't screw up.

03:04.720 --> 03:05.720
Got it.

03:07.720 --> 03:10.720
This has not stood up to the test of time, graphics-wise.

03:10.720 --> 03:12.720
My neck be bending.

03:12.720 --> 03:15.720
My armpit textures are warped.

03:17.720 --> 03:19.720
Oh, AC and Snow Berries.

03:19.720 --> 03:20.720
Hi.

03:20.720 --> 03:22.720
How was your puzzle game, AC?

03:22.720 --> 03:23.720
I watched you in the bath.

03:23.720 --> 03:25.720
Oh, this is really weird.

03:25.720 --> 03:29.720
I was in the bath and I was like, I'm sure AC should be on right now.

03:29.720 --> 03:33.720
And I opened up the game and you were like, this is a child's game.

03:33.720 --> 03:35.720
How can I do this?

03:35.720 --> 03:37.720
I thought I could do this because I think someone said,

03:37.720 --> 03:39.720
why did you pick this game first?

03:42.720 --> 03:44.720
Snow Berry Raid.

03:46.720 --> 03:50.720
Yeah, there was like a big whale with loads of ropes all over it.

03:50.720 --> 03:53.720
And I was like, I've never seen this game in my life.

03:53.720 --> 03:54.720
I'm too dumb.

03:54.720 --> 03:55.720
Did you not finish it?

03:55.720 --> 03:58.720
Was it like a finished game or was it like one of those ones where it's like,

03:58.720 --> 04:00.720
you just play for fun?

04:01.720 --> 04:03.720
Is Sheevee's fault?

04:03.720 --> 04:05.720
Sheevee, what did you do?

04:05.720 --> 04:06.720
She put the ropes in.

04:06.720 --> 04:07.720
Oh, that's very good.

04:07.720 --> 04:08.720
Oh, you finished it.

04:08.720 --> 04:09.720
Let's go.

04:09.720 --> 04:10.720
AC Smart.

04:10.720 --> 04:11.720
AC Smart.

04:11.720 --> 04:12.720
AC Smart.

04:12.720 --> 04:14.720
Hell's Gate.

04:18.720 --> 04:20.720
Kendra.

04:20.720 --> 04:23.720
Congrats if your name's Kendra.

04:23.720 --> 04:26.720
Okay, so we are playing an RDA soldier.

04:26.720 --> 04:27.720
Boots on the ground.

04:27.720 --> 04:30.720
We are a signal specialist, okay?

04:30.720 --> 04:32.720
We've just arrived at Hell's Gate,

04:32.720 --> 04:40.720
which is where the humans have landed on the Navi's home planet, basically.

04:40.720 --> 04:48.720
And the way that we humans survive is by sectioning off areas of Pandora,

04:48.720 --> 04:52.720
because Pandora is so aggressive and dangerous.

04:56.720 --> 04:57.720
Wendy, yes.

04:57.720 --> 04:59.720
The big blue ladies.

04:59.720 --> 05:00.720
Soon, soon.

05:00.720 --> 05:02.720
Hold on, hold on.

05:08.720 --> 05:10.720
You've never seen the movie before?

05:12.720 --> 05:13.720
Okay.

05:17.720 --> 05:19.720
How do you even summarize Avatar?

05:20.720 --> 05:22.720
Just watch yourself around, Dr. Monroe.

05:22.720 --> 05:26.720
He treats the avatars like his own personal guinea pigs.

05:26.720 --> 05:28.720
This is a very old game,

05:28.720 --> 05:32.720
and it is not a fair, like, assessment of what this game's about.

05:32.720 --> 05:33.720
However.

05:33.720 --> 05:35.720
However, however, however.

05:35.720 --> 05:37.720
Too long didn't read.

05:37.720 --> 05:39.720
Blue people good?

05:39.720 --> 05:40.720
Humans bad?

05:40.720 --> 05:42.720
Capitalism bad?

05:42.720 --> 05:44.720
Being nice to the environment?

05:44.720 --> 05:45.720
Good!

05:45.720 --> 05:46.720
That's it.

05:46.720 --> 05:47.720
That's all you have to know.

05:48.720 --> 05:49.720
That's all you have to know.

05:49.720 --> 05:53.720
You have completely caught up to the Avatar franchise,

05:53.720 --> 05:55.720
as we know right now.

05:56.720 --> 05:57.720
Bojinga, I think.

06:00.720 --> 06:01.720
Brian?

06:04.720 --> 06:07.720
Not me getting Brian back on the HUD.

06:07.720 --> 06:11.720
Thank you so much, Bojinga, for the 13, I appreciate it.

06:11.720 --> 06:14.720
I'm looking forward to this stream of this game that literally no one has played.

06:14.720 --> 06:16.720
I wish I could do a poll right now,

06:16.720 --> 06:19.720
but if I back out of this game,

06:19.720 --> 06:21.720
it crashes super easily,

06:21.720 --> 06:23.720
so basically,

06:23.720 --> 06:27.720
I don't even know if I'm going for a toilet break today.

06:27.720 --> 06:32.720
I looked it up and it said apparently the campaign mode is...

06:32.720 --> 06:34.720
8 hours, but I don't believe it.

06:34.720 --> 06:35.720
Yes.

06:35.720 --> 06:37.720
We're at signal specialist.

06:37.720 --> 06:38.720
I didn't even know there was an avatar.

06:38.720 --> 06:41.720
Well, there's a new avatar game now, but we're playing the old-

06:42.720 --> 06:46.720
Let me take a sip of my honey tea today.

06:46.720 --> 06:47.720
Aloha.

06:49.720 --> 06:51.720
Did you guys watch Mercy's ASMR?

06:51.720 --> 06:53.720
Congrats to Mercy!

06:53.720 --> 06:57.720
Mojie's been the only member of Euler to not get her VOD taken down

06:57.720 --> 07:01.720
and leave a warning on her channel for sexual misconduct.

07:01.720 --> 07:03.720
Give it up for Mercy!

07:06.720 --> 07:07.720
Oh my God.

07:08.720 --> 07:10.720
Let's go, Mercy!

07:13.720 --> 07:16.720
I am so nervous for my ASMR stream

07:16.720 --> 07:20.720
because I had planned something a bit special for it.

07:21.720 --> 07:22.720
And...

07:24.720 --> 07:27.720
YouTube are dancing with all of us right now.

07:29.720 --> 07:31.720
Sorry, I'll get over the cutscenes first.

07:31.720 --> 07:34.720
We get to experience being in a navi body for the first time.

07:34.720 --> 07:36.720
If you haven't played, or don't know,

07:36.720 --> 07:42.720
you enter a booth which neural links you to an actual navi body.

07:42.720 --> 07:44.720
Don't look too much into it.

07:44.720 --> 07:47.720
It's pretty fantasy-based and all that jazz, but yeah.

07:47.720 --> 07:50.720
We are now in navi, we have access to a navi body,

07:50.720 --> 07:52.720
but we are still RDA.

07:52.720 --> 07:53.720
RDA's the bad guys.

07:53.720 --> 07:55.720
Boo! Boo! RDA!

07:55.720 --> 07:57.720
Navi! Yay! Navi! Yay!

07:57.720 --> 07:59.720
But RDA, boo!

08:00.720 --> 08:01.720
Go.

08:04.720 --> 08:06.720
Oh my God, that neck!

08:06.720 --> 08:08.720
That's killing me.

08:08.720 --> 08:10.720
She looks like a giraffe.

08:10.720 --> 08:12.720
Let me get over this bed real quick.

08:20.720 --> 08:23.720
So we have just been introduced to our avatar body.

08:24.720 --> 08:25.720
Navi body.

08:25.720 --> 08:27.720
RDA mission complete.

08:28.720 --> 08:30.720
So yes, this is a much older game.

08:30.720 --> 08:31.720
We're just...

08:36.720 --> 08:38.720
So we are about to...

08:48.720 --> 08:49.720
Anyway.

08:49.720 --> 08:50.720
She's pampering us.

08:50.720 --> 08:51.720
It looks good for its age.

08:51.720 --> 08:52.720
Honestly!

08:52.720 --> 08:54.720
So the newest avatar, I haven't had an...

08:54.720 --> 08:55.720
Oh!

08:55.720 --> 08:56.720
Brian!

09:01.720 --> 09:03.720
Bero, thank you for the 20.

09:03.720 --> 09:05.720
Would you guys neural link with me?

09:05.720 --> 09:09.720
Like, if you could go to bed, like, you see everything from APOV?

09:09.720 --> 09:10.720
Would that...

09:10.720 --> 09:12.720
Would I still be in control at that point?

09:12.720 --> 09:14.720
Or would you want to control me?

09:14.720 --> 09:16.720
Or would you want me to control you?

09:21.720 --> 09:23.720
Do you really need to ask?

09:24.720 --> 09:26.720
I don't know if you want to see my POV.

09:26.720 --> 09:29.720
You just, like, dine and be really disappointed that I don't have big boobs.

09:31.720 --> 09:33.720
Does the nicotine patch interfere with the process?

09:33.720 --> 09:35.720
Nah, you can leave it on.

09:35.720 --> 09:38.720
If anything, it makes it better when you're in.

09:38.720 --> 09:46.720
So this is the reason we are in Pandora, the world.

09:46.720 --> 09:49.720
You see those purple things underneath?

09:49.720 --> 09:53.720
Those are the resources we mine from this planet for capitalism back on Earth.

09:53.720 --> 09:54.720
It is crazy.

09:54.720 --> 09:56.720
Honestly, I get to pray.

09:58.720 --> 10:01.720
Hard to believe you're finally here.

10:04.720 --> 10:05.720
A-turn!

10:05.720 --> 10:06.720
Oop!

10:16.720 --> 10:17.720
They're purple.

10:17.720 --> 10:19.720
The resources are purple.

10:21.720 --> 10:23.720
A big butt better than Big Boa.

10:26.720 --> 10:28.720
We're here to get the blue oil.

10:28.720 --> 10:30.720
Did someone say oil?

10:38.720 --> 10:42.720
By the dawn, sparely.

10:42.720 --> 10:43.720
Did I tell you?

10:43.720 --> 10:45.720
In a voice chat,

10:45.720 --> 10:48.720
I sung that, but I only know the first two lines.

10:48.720 --> 10:54.720
And then freakin' Sheevie and Azura burst out into singing like the actual thing.

10:54.720 --> 10:57.720
And I was like, oh my god, this is really...

10:57.720 --> 11:01.720
I was getting serenaded by the dawn,

11:01.720 --> 11:03.720
sparely.

11:03.720 --> 11:06.720
I once prayed.

11:06.720 --> 11:08.720
I don't know the words at all.

11:08.720 --> 11:09.720
And I don't know why it's so hard.

11:09.720 --> 11:11.720
Like, why does it go high?

11:12.720 --> 11:17.720
Did you guys see my Twitter post about how much I got scammed on American sweets?

11:17.720 --> 11:19.720
Hello!

11:19.720 --> 11:21.720
So these are just basic transporters,

11:21.720 --> 11:23.720
but as you can see, this is the whole map of Pandora.

11:23.720 --> 11:25.720
We will unlock a few more locations soon,

11:25.720 --> 11:27.720
but there's not really much detail to it.

11:27.720 --> 11:28.720
We're currently at Hell's Gate.

11:28.720 --> 11:31.720
We are going to get flown to Blue Lagoon,

11:31.720 --> 11:33.720
but as you can see, this Earth is healthy.

11:33.720 --> 11:36.720
There's lots of blues and greens and all that.

11:36.720 --> 11:38.720
It's a nice, healthy Earth.

11:38.720 --> 11:40.720
Blue Lagoon.

11:40.720 --> 11:42.720
Open the game...

11:42.720 --> 11:44.720
Oh, that's just the information thing.

11:44.720 --> 11:46.720
I thought I was going to explain what Blue Lagoon is.

11:46.720 --> 11:49.720
Blue Lagoon is where a lot of the navi

11:49.720 --> 11:51.720
that are controlled by the RDA-side hangout

11:51.720 --> 11:56.720
and a few of the tribes are tolerant to our behaviors.

11:56.720 --> 11:58.720
Our human activities.

12:03.720 --> 12:06.720
So this is Tutorial Island, essentially.

12:06.720 --> 12:08.720
I thought this game was a fever dream.

12:08.720 --> 12:10.720
It's real!

12:10.720 --> 12:12.720
Hi, Stony. I remember playing this game as a kid.

12:12.720 --> 12:14.720
Congrats, you're one of the two people

12:14.720 --> 12:16.720
who have played this game that's watching right now.

12:16.720 --> 12:18.720
A very, very underground game.

12:18.720 --> 12:21.720
I'll tell you a very fun factoid about this game.

12:21.720 --> 12:23.720
So obviously, I was an Xbox kid.

12:23.720 --> 12:29.720
If you were able to obtain a copy of the special...

12:39.720 --> 12:42.720
Oh, I loved that little animation.

12:42.720 --> 12:45.720
This was probably before motion capture was even a thing

12:45.720 --> 12:47.720
because what the heck was that?

12:48.720 --> 12:51.720
Our encounter with Pandora's wildlife.

12:51.720 --> 12:53.720
These are Viperwills.

12:53.720 --> 12:55.720
They're terrifying.

12:56.720 --> 12:58.720
But their designs are so good.

12:58.720 --> 13:01.720
The animal designs are freaking amazing.

13:01.720 --> 13:04.720
I am needing to remember.

13:04.720 --> 13:06.720
That's to analyze.

13:06.720 --> 13:10.720
Okay, so we have freaking special abilities.

13:10.720 --> 13:13.720
For some reason, I can go and visit and shit.

13:13.720 --> 13:15.720
But you can level up and progress

13:15.720 --> 13:17.720
and make these abilities way stronger.

13:17.720 --> 13:19.720
But literally, it's pretty insane.

13:19.720 --> 13:22.720
The game's got loads of things going for it.

13:22.720 --> 13:25.720
So right now, we're just defending the perimeter

13:25.720 --> 13:28.720
from what way the game isn't too loud.

13:28.720 --> 13:30.720
I cannot adjust the volume without breaking it.

13:30.720 --> 13:33.720
We're just defending the perimeter from...

13:33.720 --> 13:35.720
Oh, I almost just shot our own guy there.

13:35.720 --> 13:37.720
Is it working?

13:37.720 --> 13:39.720
Okay, there we go.

13:39.720 --> 13:41.720
You do get XP.

13:41.720 --> 13:43.720
There is a level-up system in this game as well.

13:43.720 --> 13:44.720
I am so bad at aiming.

13:44.720 --> 13:47.720
Holy crap, I don't remember it being this hard as a child.

13:47.720 --> 13:51.720
Child Me is like so much better gamer

13:51.720 --> 13:54.720
when it comes to this stuff, honestly.

13:54.720 --> 13:56.720
Lollipop model confirmed

13:56.720 --> 13:58.720
we're doing some reward.

13:58.720 --> 14:02.720
Because, actually, why am I so much better at this game?

14:02.720 --> 14:05.720
I know they spawn over there a lot.

14:05.720 --> 14:07.720
Okay, objective complete.

14:07.720 --> 14:09.720
Love to see you play the game,

14:09.720 --> 14:13.720
but I will be very happy for every Navi I see die.

14:13.720 --> 14:15.720
For the RDA for humanity.

14:15.720 --> 14:16.720
You're joking.

14:16.720 --> 14:18.720
You picked the RDA?

14:18.720 --> 14:19.720
Who are you?

14:19.720 --> 14:20.720
Iron Reaper?

14:20.720 --> 14:22.720
You picked the freaking...

14:22.720 --> 14:24.720
Why would you prick?

14:24.720 --> 14:26.720
Oh, I literally just had a Freudian slip

14:26.720 --> 14:28.720
and called you a prick there.

14:28.720 --> 14:30.720
Why would you pick?

14:30.720 --> 14:32.720
This is not the Navi.

14:32.720 --> 14:33.720
Thank you for the 50.

14:33.720 --> 14:34.720
That's insane.

14:34.720 --> 14:35.720
Thank you for the 50.

14:35.720 --> 14:36.720
Grab a buggy and help him out.

14:36.720 --> 14:38.720
But you're wrong.

14:38.720 --> 14:40.720
RDA Supremacy.

14:40.720 --> 14:43.720
Reef Flames?

14:43.720 --> 14:46.720
We're here for nature

14:46.720 --> 14:50.720
and to be nice to wildlife.

14:50.720 --> 14:51.720
I'm literally a cuttlefish.

14:51.720 --> 14:53.720
Are you saying...

14:53.720 --> 14:55.720
Oh, is this Halo Controls?

14:55.720 --> 14:57.720
No, kind of.

14:57.720 --> 14:59.720
You can be attacked when you go out,

14:59.720 --> 15:01.720
but I will say one thing.

15:01.720 --> 15:02.720
The motion sickness.

15:02.720 --> 15:03.720
Merci.

15:03.720 --> 15:04.720
If you're lurking, do not watch this.

15:04.720 --> 15:07.720
This motion sickness on the vehicles is insane.

15:07.720 --> 15:08.720
Oh, we're doing hit and runs.

15:08.720 --> 15:09.720
We're doing hit and runs.

15:09.720 --> 15:10.720
Get wrecked.

15:10.720 --> 15:11.720
Oh, right.

15:11.720 --> 15:12.720
I missed that, but whatever.

15:12.720 --> 15:14.720
Oh, I can't remember much.

15:14.720 --> 15:15.720
There is going to be...

15:15.720 --> 15:17.720
This guy should...

15:17.720 --> 15:19.720
There is like aim assist in this game.

15:19.720 --> 15:21.720
So if you're bad at video games,

15:21.720 --> 15:22.720
please don't worry.

15:22.720 --> 15:25.720
If you ever think you might want to

15:25.720 --> 15:26.720
get this game a shot.

15:26.720 --> 15:28.720
You're a lifesaver.

15:28.720 --> 15:31.720
This game is giving commands for keyboard,

15:31.720 --> 15:35.720
but that's because...

15:35.720 --> 15:36.720
Wait, wait, wait.

15:36.720 --> 15:37.720
Butt bounce.

15:37.720 --> 15:40.720
Wait, where the heck did it go?

15:40.720 --> 15:43.720
I'm fighting.

15:43.720 --> 15:46.720
Oh, we're going to stick them out to go down.

15:46.720 --> 15:47.720
Oh, come on.

15:47.720 --> 15:48.720
You can tell Kale as well,

15:48.720 --> 15:49.720
which is really good in this game.

15:49.720 --> 15:51.720
This game is definitely for people

15:51.720 --> 15:53.720
who are not very...

15:53.720 --> 15:54.720
I would say if you're new to gaming,

15:54.720 --> 15:57.720
the game is very friendly to you.

15:57.720 --> 15:59.720
I say that as I literally am forgetting

15:59.720 --> 16:02.720
all the spawn locations of the enemies right now.

16:02.720 --> 16:07.720
These are Viper Wolves.

16:07.720 --> 16:10.720
Literally waiting until this game gets so beautiful.

16:10.720 --> 16:11.720
I wish...

16:11.720 --> 16:14.720
I don't know what the new avatar game is like genuinely about.

16:14.720 --> 16:15.720
I heard those growls.

16:15.720 --> 16:16.720
I heard that.

16:16.720 --> 16:19.720
I have gamer sense, okay?

16:19.720 --> 16:21.720
Oh, there's another one.

16:21.720 --> 16:22.720
Jeez.

16:22.720 --> 16:23.720
Whoa.

16:23.720 --> 16:26.720
My trigger just got stuck there.

16:27.720 --> 16:30.720
Are you squidding me right now?

16:30.720 --> 16:33.720
Glory to humanity and cuttlefish.

16:33.720 --> 16:36.720
Down with the navi.

16:36.720 --> 16:39.720
No, the navi are the good guys.

16:39.720 --> 16:40.720
Slice Saber?

16:40.720 --> 16:42.720
How dare you?

16:42.720 --> 16:44.720
Thank you for the tip.

16:44.720 --> 16:46.720
But the navi are the good guys.

16:46.720 --> 16:51.720
We're supposed to protect humanity, okay?

16:51.720 --> 16:53.720
Right, so we're currently saving

16:53.720 --> 16:55.720
the current signal thing or something.

16:55.720 --> 16:57.720
I don't know.

16:57.720 --> 16:58.720
Tutorial.

16:58.720 --> 17:00.720
We are doing tutorial, but I'm just spamming through it

17:00.720 --> 17:02.720
because I want to be navi.

17:02.720 --> 17:04.720
Just to be those dogs.

17:07.720 --> 17:10.720
Everyone's literally so beefed up in this game for no reason.

17:10.720 --> 17:12.720
Wait, you say navi's good guys.

17:12.720 --> 17:15.720
Protect humanity.

17:15.720 --> 17:17.720
The navi are the big blue ones.

17:17.720 --> 17:19.720
The big blue ones protect nature.

17:19.720 --> 17:21.720
We protect nature, okay?

17:25.720 --> 17:26.720
We...

17:26.720 --> 17:28.720
Wait, hold on, hold on, hold on.

17:28.720 --> 17:29.720
You ready for this?

17:29.720 --> 17:30.720
We...

17:30.720 --> 17:34.720
You want to protect nature, little reform.

17:34.720 --> 17:38.720
You want to be a good boy for humanity.

17:38.720 --> 17:41.720
You want to recycle where physically possible.

17:41.720 --> 17:43.720
But we understand...

17:43.720 --> 17:44.720
Oh, wait.

17:44.720 --> 17:47.720
If the RDA are the bad guys, then why are their mechs so cool?

17:47.720 --> 17:49.720
Checkmate, tree huggers.

17:49.720 --> 17:51.720
Uh...

17:51.720 --> 17:52.720
The rea...

17:52.720 --> 17:54.720
Well, I'm gonna show you me absolutely wrecking

17:54.720 --> 17:56.720
and fricking decking those mechs.

17:59.720 --> 18:04.720
There's no way you guys are genuinely picking the human side.

18:04.720 --> 18:06.720
Doomsday, Dan, you're getting a spank,

18:06.720 --> 18:07.720
but thanks for the tip.

18:07.720 --> 18:09.720
And Beijing got again.

18:09.720 --> 18:11.720
No, you're wrong.

18:11.720 --> 18:13.720
You have to be nice.

18:13.720 --> 18:15.720
If I have to hit me...

18:15.720 --> 18:16.720
Tree huggers!

18:16.720 --> 18:18.720
If that makes me a tree hugger,

18:18.720 --> 18:19.720
then guess what?

18:19.720 --> 18:21.720
I'll proudly identify myself as a tree humper.

18:21.720 --> 18:22.720
Oh, I just got...

18:22.720 --> 18:23.720
Oh, I'm getting...

18:23.720 --> 18:24.720
I'm getting...

18:24.720 --> 18:25.720
I'm getting ganged up on.

18:25.720 --> 18:27.720
I'm getting ganged up on.

18:27.720 --> 18:29.720
Literally, the bark is peeling off from how hard

18:29.720 --> 18:32.720
I'm humping the wildlife right now, okay?

18:32.720 --> 18:33.720
Because...

18:33.720 --> 18:34.720
I'm not...

18:34.720 --> 18:35.720
I'm not...

18:35.720 --> 18:36.720
Oh, um...

18:36.720 --> 18:38.720
This is so much easier as a child.

18:38.720 --> 18:39.720
Hello, child, me.

18:39.720 --> 18:40.720
Can you just, like...

18:40.720 --> 18:42.720
I don't know, possess my body right now?

18:42.720 --> 18:44.720
Because why am I getting wrecked and decked?

18:44.720 --> 18:45.720
There's...

18:46.720 --> 18:47.720
Uh...

18:49.720 --> 18:51.720
Oh, for goodness sake, wait, wait, wait, wait.

18:51.720 --> 18:52.720
I'm getting wrecked.

18:52.720 --> 18:53.720
I'm getting wrecked.

19:01.720 --> 19:03.720
What'd you get?

19:03.720 --> 19:04.720
Tim...

19:04.720 --> 19:05.720
What the heck?

19:05.720 --> 19:06.720
Tim Shuttle?

19:06.720 --> 19:07.720
Tim Shuttle?

19:07.720 --> 19:08.720
Your name is literally Cuttlefish.

19:08.720 --> 19:09.720
A little Shuttlefish.

19:09.720 --> 19:11.720
Glory to the hip, no toad.

19:11.720 --> 19:12.720
Protect the Navi and the sea star.

19:12.720 --> 19:14.720
See, Tim knows exactly what he's on about.

19:14.720 --> 19:15.720
Thank you, Tim.

19:15.720 --> 19:17.720
At least some of us have since...

19:26.720 --> 19:27.720
Right.

19:27.720 --> 19:28.720
You've got me there.

19:28.720 --> 19:29.720
You've got me a wee bit there.

19:29.720 --> 19:30.720
Hold on, hold on.

19:30.720 --> 19:31.720
But give him a chance.

19:31.720 --> 19:32.720
Give him a chance.

19:32.720 --> 19:34.720
Thank you, Otter Von Biscuit.

19:34.720 --> 19:36.720
Damn right you only sent for Cuttlefish.

19:36.720 --> 19:38.720
We the best out here.

19:38.720 --> 19:39.720
Wait, I just realized.

19:39.720 --> 19:42.720
I think I'm supposed to drive the car in here.

19:42.720 --> 19:44.720
Oh, I think I'm about to get attacked.

19:44.720 --> 19:46.720
Or maybe those guys are protecting me.

19:46.720 --> 19:48.720
I'm not sure.

19:48.720 --> 19:50.720
There we go.

19:50.720 --> 19:52.720
Run that, logist!

19:52.720 --> 19:53.720
Oh!

19:53.720 --> 19:55.720
See, you have level up system.

19:59.720 --> 20:02.720
Um, I have terrible news for you.

20:02.720 --> 20:05.720
If you want to do survival of the fittest, no weapons.

20:05.720 --> 20:06.720
Absolutely.

20:06.720 --> 20:07.720
Goodness.

20:07.720 --> 20:08.720
Is this...?

20:08.720 --> 20:09.720
Ah!

20:09.720 --> 20:11.720
Take this!

20:11.720 --> 20:13.720
Fart Bomb.

20:13.720 --> 20:16.720
Thank you very much.

20:16.720 --> 20:19.720
Sarge, IBW.

20:19.720 --> 20:20.720
What a unique...

20:20.720 --> 20:21.720
Thank you.

20:21.720 --> 20:22.720
Thank you very much for the tip.

20:22.720 --> 20:25.720
Sorry, Strony, but I'll never trust a species at...

20:25.720 --> 20:26.720
Look.

20:26.720 --> 20:28.720
All I'm seeing is give tentacles a chance.

20:28.720 --> 20:32.720
I might be getting a little tentacle addition here and there, you know?

20:32.720 --> 20:33.720
Am I going the wrong way?

20:33.720 --> 20:35.720
It looks like I'm going the wrong way on the map.

20:35.720 --> 20:36.720
I've not been here before.

20:36.720 --> 20:39.720
Oh my goodness, the camera angle.

20:39.720 --> 20:41.720
Look, the game aged all right.

20:41.720 --> 20:42.720
I'm not going to say it aged well.

20:42.720 --> 20:44.720
Wait, is there a little path back here?

20:44.720 --> 20:45.720
No, there's not.

20:45.720 --> 20:46.720
It's a lie.

20:46.720 --> 20:47.720
It's a lie.

20:47.720 --> 20:48.720
It's up here.

20:48.720 --> 20:51.720
Oh my goodness, this camera angle is horrific!

20:51.720 --> 20:54.720
I'm getting sick of myself.

20:54.720 --> 20:56.720
Let me in!

20:56.720 --> 20:57.720
Let me in!

20:57.720 --> 20:58.720
I'm human!

20:58.720 --> 20:59.720
What are you doing?

20:59.720 --> 21:01.720
Okay, I actually have to go backwards?

21:01.720 --> 21:02.720
Jeez.

21:02.720 --> 21:03.720
Thank you.

21:03.720 --> 21:04.720
Not Alessandro as well.

21:04.720 --> 21:05.720
Rules of nature, survival...

21:05.720 --> 21:06.720
Yeah, no.

21:06.720 --> 21:07.720
Oh my goodness!

21:07.720 --> 21:08.720
Wait!

21:08.720 --> 21:09.720
Oh my God!

21:09.720 --> 21:10.720
Lady driver moment!

21:10.720 --> 21:11.720
Please!

21:11.720 --> 21:12.720
Camera angle!

21:12.720 --> 21:13.720
Please!

21:13.720 --> 21:14.720
Jeez!

21:14.720 --> 21:15.720
Louise!

21:15.720 --> 21:16.720
Let me work here!

21:16.720 --> 21:17.720
My goodness!

21:17.720 --> 21:18.720
This is awful!

21:18.720 --> 21:19.720
Why is the camera...

21:19.720 --> 21:20.720
Oh my God!

21:20.720 --> 21:21.720
This is horrific!

21:21.720 --> 21:22.720
Are you kidding me right now?

21:22.720 --> 21:23.720
Oh, thank God.

21:23.720 --> 21:24.720
I don't get emotions like in the video games.

21:24.720 --> 21:25.720
Do you not expect the message to work this time long?

21:25.720 --> 21:26.720
Anyways, have fun, stroney and dreams.

21:26.720 --> 21:27.720
Brian's back!

21:27.720 --> 21:31.720
So when you tip, you can actually, like, act in here and you can hear it.

21:31.720 --> 21:34.720
Thank you again for the another tip, Alessandro!

21:34.720 --> 21:35.720
Eh, bitches.

21:35.720 --> 21:37.720
When you tip, you will never be read out.

21:37.720 --> 21:39.720
Oh my God, that camera angle is horrific.

21:39.720 --> 21:40.720
Please.

21:40.720 --> 21:42.720
Do not ever make me drive one of those again.

21:42.720 --> 21:43.720
Thank you.

21:43.720 --> 21:44.720
Oh, goodness me.

21:44.720 --> 21:45.720
Right.

21:45.720 --> 21:46.720
What is the heck is this?

21:46.720 --> 21:47.720
I've forgotten.

21:47.720 --> 21:48.720
Oh, it's a teleport pod.

21:48.720 --> 21:49.720
Okay.

21:49.720 --> 21:51.720
You can teleport between the different regions.

21:51.720 --> 21:54.720
So this is all the Blue Lagoon areas.

21:54.720 --> 21:55.720
Oh my God!

21:55.720 --> 21:56.720
This is awesome!

21:56.720 --> 21:57.720
Oh my God!

21:57.720 --> 21:58.720
That camera angle is horrific.

21:58.720 --> 21:59.720
Please.

21:59.720 --> 22:01.720
This is all the Blue Lagoon area.

22:01.720 --> 22:04.720
But as you can see, there's one, two, three, four, five.

22:04.720 --> 22:07.720
Why are the teleport points all at the bottom and only one at the top?

22:07.720 --> 22:09.720
Eh, I see how it is.

22:09.720 --> 22:11.720
Make a mirror walk everywhere.

22:11.720 --> 22:14.720
Okay, a little sip of my tea.

22:14.720 --> 22:15.720
Have you played it?

22:15.720 --> 22:17.720
Are you sure you've played this before?

22:17.720 --> 22:18.720
The accusations?

22:18.720 --> 22:20.720
I'm not beating the accusations.

22:20.720 --> 22:24.720
Right, I'm going to finish my tea before it gets too cold.

22:24.720 --> 22:25.720
Mmm.

22:25.720 --> 22:26.720
I'm delicious.

22:26.720 --> 22:28.720
I like the reverb effect on the verb.

22:28.720 --> 22:34.720
I mean, I don't want to ruin anything, but that's definitely may or may not happen in

22:34.720 --> 22:36.720
a certain ASMR stream.

22:36.720 --> 22:40.720
I like freaking changed the title of the ASMR stream because I don't know what is going

22:40.720 --> 22:41.720
on.

22:41.720 --> 22:43.720
Everyone's getting warnings left, right and center.

22:43.720 --> 22:44.720
Now don't get me wrong.

22:44.720 --> 22:48.720
Any jumping up and doing on the bed is quite humorous, okay?

22:48.720 --> 22:52.720
And I don't know, did she be actually doing anything that was that wrong?

22:52.720 --> 22:59.720
Now the only reason I will say Azura had received that warning was on the pure basis.

22:59.720 --> 23:02.720
Her voice is just like honey.

23:02.720 --> 23:07.720
Her voice is the sun embracing you after a few days of rain.

23:07.720 --> 23:14.720
Her voice is like that hug you have needed for years and you just let it all out and

23:14.720 --> 23:17.720
you feel like her.

23:17.720 --> 23:25.720
However, the other side of the coin for Azura's voice is it won't go down.

23:25.720 --> 23:27.720
It can't stay down.

23:27.720 --> 23:32.720
There's no such thing as a refractory period to her when you listen to her voice.

23:32.720 --> 23:34.720
Maybe you'll get 10 minutes a piece at max.

23:34.720 --> 23:35.720
You know what I'm saying?

23:35.720 --> 23:38.720
So I kind of get why she got a warning.

23:38.720 --> 23:42.720
I don't think she'd be got a warning because she was wise enough to private it.

23:42.720 --> 23:43.720
I don't know.

23:43.720 --> 23:47.720
I don't know if she did delete that.

23:47.720 --> 23:48.720
Did she do ear licking?

23:48.720 --> 23:49.720
Oh goodness me.

23:49.720 --> 23:50.720
Can't even do a ear licking.

23:50.720 --> 23:54.720
I don't know what's going on because people that show their face are still uploading all

23:54.720 --> 23:55.720
fine and dandy.

23:55.720 --> 24:02.720
So I think there might be a H-E-N update to the tie.

24:02.720 --> 24:04.720
Possibly pop stealth policy.

24:04.720 --> 24:06.720
Oh god, not the camera angle again.

24:06.720 --> 24:10.720
I'm currently driving with one hand so this is going to go absolutely awful.

24:11.720 --> 24:13.720
But look how big Pandora is.

24:13.720 --> 24:15.720
It's fantastic.

24:15.720 --> 24:18.720
One hand steering whilst I drink my tea.

24:18.720 --> 24:23.720
I'm like a real contractor honestly.

24:23.720 --> 24:25.720
Look, I'm just here to do the contract work.

24:25.720 --> 24:27.720
I'm not here to do anything special.

24:27.720 --> 24:32.720
I get paid on the day.

24:32.720 --> 24:34.720
Okay, driving isn't actually that bad right?

24:34.720 --> 24:35.720
Let's speed up.

24:35.720 --> 24:36.720
Let's go.

24:36.720 --> 24:37.720
Let's see if two handed.

24:37.720 --> 24:39.720
I'm even worse probably.

24:40.720 --> 24:43.720
Oh, I'm hitting the land.

24:43.720 --> 24:44.720
I'm doing the Titanic.

24:44.720 --> 24:45.720
Titanic momentum.

24:45.720 --> 24:50.720
I am played this game when I was young and when I tell people about it, they never believe

24:50.720 --> 24:51.720
it's real.

24:51.720 --> 24:54.720
Also for the Navi, support nature.

24:54.720 --> 24:55.720
Yes, thank you.

24:55.720 --> 24:57.720
Thank you for the tip, Kitsune.

24:57.720 --> 24:58.720
Gaming today.

24:58.720 --> 25:05.720
Literally, I don't think I've really met anyone that's heard about this hecking game.

25:05.720 --> 25:07.720
But I'm glad that a few of you actually have played it.

25:07.720 --> 25:11.720
Okay, I'm just unlocking teleport stations when I do that.

25:11.720 --> 25:13.720
Hi, hi everyone joining.

25:13.720 --> 25:14.720
We're playing Avatar.

25:14.720 --> 25:16.720
James Cameron's Avatar.

25:16.720 --> 25:21.720
Some people thought it was Avatar, the last airbender related.

25:21.720 --> 25:23.720
No, no, no, no, no.

25:23.720 --> 25:24.720
Not at all.

25:24.720 --> 25:28.720
Although, I think Amy might be doing a watch along that if you're into watch longs.

25:28.720 --> 25:33.720
Please do think about supporting your local neighborhood little sister because she may

25:33.720 --> 25:35.720
be doing a watch along that a little bit.

25:35.720 --> 25:37.720
I'm going to take a little sipping tune of my cola.

25:37.720 --> 25:39.720
I need to hydrate.

25:39.720 --> 25:43.720
Now I get to ramble about all the work I did yesterday.

25:43.720 --> 25:46.720
Okay, so the update is...

25:46.720 --> 25:47.720
Are you squidding me right now?

25:47.720 --> 25:48.720
Unless...

25:48.720 --> 25:49.720
Brian!

25:49.720 --> 25:52.720
Gaming in one hand while she stronts the cuddles in the other.

25:52.720 --> 25:54.720
It's more difficult than you think.

25:54.720 --> 25:56.720
Not that I'd know.

25:56.720 --> 25:59.720
Honestly, thank you for the tip.

25:59.720 --> 26:00.720
Tharja.

26:00.720 --> 26:03.720
Tharja, I feel like that's not how you're supposed to pronounce it.

26:03.720 --> 26:06.720
Are you Swedish and it's Tharja?

26:06.720 --> 26:07.720
Tharja?

26:07.720 --> 26:10.720
A little bit of a Swedish moment.

26:13.720 --> 26:16.720
Look, it's that guy we saved in that cave only a few minutes ago.

26:27.720 --> 26:28.720
What kind of cola?

26:28.720 --> 26:30.720
Just cola cola.

26:30.720 --> 26:33.720
Is it called Coke Zero when it's got the no sugar?

26:33.720 --> 26:36.720
I finally went no sugar on the cola.

26:36.720 --> 26:37.720
Aspartame.

26:37.720 --> 26:39.720
I can finally tolerate aspartame.

26:39.720 --> 26:43.720
It is that thing that is in the drinks to make it sugar-free.

26:43.720 --> 26:46.720
But I was like, I don't mind having a big badonk-a-donk,

26:46.720 --> 26:48.720
but I don't want it to get too big.

26:48.720 --> 26:50.720
So I'm now drinking aspartame,

26:50.720 --> 26:53.720
which apparently gives rats cancer.

26:53.720 --> 26:55.720
So it's not looking good for us mammals.

26:55.720 --> 26:57.720
But hey, oh, you got to die something.

26:57.720 --> 27:00.720
And, you know, I'm not going out without enjoying myself.

27:00.720 --> 27:02.720
That's all I'm saying on that much.

27:02.720 --> 27:03.720
Right.

27:03.720 --> 27:06.720
There are vapor wheels here, so please excuse the combat.

27:06.720 --> 27:07.720
Boom.

27:07.720 --> 27:11.720
Now you can just came to do this,

27:11.720 --> 27:15.720
but it does bring you out of fricking invisibility.

27:15.720 --> 27:18.720
Get in the boat, get in the boat, drive away, drive away.

27:18.720 --> 27:22.720
Yeah, see, they get scared of my little fart bomb.

27:22.720 --> 27:25.720
Actually, I think it's called a supersonic wave

27:25.720 --> 27:27.720
and they don't like the noise, which makes sense.

27:27.720 --> 27:29.720
You know, nature doesn't like loud noises.

27:29.720 --> 27:33.720
Can relate on a physiological...

27:33.720 --> 27:34.720
Physiological?

27:34.720 --> 27:36.720
No, not physiological.

27:36.720 --> 27:40.720
Oh, now you can just skip quite a bit of combat if you're cheeky,

27:40.720 --> 27:43.720
but only if you're smart enough to do the things in the correct timing.

27:43.720 --> 27:44.720
I'm going to heal up.

27:44.720 --> 27:47.720
You can heal up naturally and it just means gentle for time.

27:47.720 --> 27:50.720
As I said, this game is super forgiving to new gamers.

27:51.720 --> 27:55.720
If you are into kind of that fantasy element, then...

27:55.720 --> 27:57.720
Am I to walk from here?

27:57.720 --> 27:58.720
I can't walk from here.

28:01.720 --> 28:04.720
Nature doesn't like loud noises.

28:04.720 --> 28:06.720
Literally the loudest of nature.

28:08.720 --> 28:11.720
The sea bomb or a big badonka?

28:11.720 --> 28:12.720
Those are the two choices.

28:12.720 --> 28:13.720
I don't want to...

28:13.720 --> 28:15.720
I don't mind getting too big.

28:15.720 --> 28:17.720
No, sorry, I do mind getting too big.

28:17.720 --> 28:19.720
You know, you got to keep that pear shape on.

28:19.720 --> 28:22.720
You know, like when I do that hand cam stream,

28:22.720 --> 28:26.720
everyone's going to know the real size of my chest.

28:40.720 --> 28:43.720
Yes, I will teach you all the strats of this game.

28:45.720 --> 28:47.720
For those who are wondering,

28:47.720 --> 28:49.720
is this an adjourned stream?

28:49.720 --> 28:53.720
This is roughly a seven hour stream.

28:55.720 --> 28:58.720
So do feel free to stream yourself for the full seven hours.

28:58.720 --> 29:00.720
If not, then the seven hour stream.

29:01.720 --> 29:02.720
Roughly.

29:02.720 --> 29:08.720
I believe we will actually successfully catch Mercy for a redirect

29:08.720 --> 29:12.720
if my humble Mercy is streaming today, which I believe she is.

29:12.720 --> 29:15.720
As always, if any of my gen mates come online,

29:15.720 --> 29:20.720
please remind me and I will tell those who would much prefer to watch

29:20.720 --> 29:24.720
a game that isn't archaic or whatever they're doing on stream.

29:26.720 --> 29:29.720
We're supposed to for seven hours.

29:29.720 --> 29:32.720
I feel like that would hurt.

29:34.720 --> 29:38.720
But anyway, because I cannot tell you how strange it was

29:38.720 --> 29:41.720
to go offline after two hours,

29:41.720 --> 29:44.720
it literally felt like, what do we do now?

29:44.720 --> 29:46.720
Oh, now we play the game.

29:46.720 --> 29:50.720
Because I was like, wait, I have so much time and yeah.

29:50.720 --> 29:55.720
So I've got three more ASMR collabs on the way.

29:55.720 --> 29:56.720
I did a little bit of socializing.

29:56.720 --> 29:57.720
We are now Navi.

29:57.720 --> 29:59.720
We're about to do some Navi questlines.

29:59.720 --> 30:03.720
But please remember, we are RDA Navi.

30:03.720 --> 30:07.720
To use teleportations, we use the tree of vision.

30:07.720 --> 30:09.720
It's very important to get those because my goodness,

30:09.720 --> 30:11.720
it makes travel so much easier.

30:14.720 --> 30:17.720
Look how tall we are and the camera angle has changed

30:17.720 --> 30:19.720
and is much more favorable.

30:19.720 --> 30:25.720
I prefer when video games have a really pooled out third perspective camera.

30:25.720 --> 30:29.720
If the camera is two centimeters away from my face, I do not like it.

30:29.720 --> 30:31.720
I find it very hard to look at.

30:31.720 --> 30:36.720
I don't know if that's because I need glasses

30:36.720 --> 30:40.720
and I still haven't trained myself to wear glasses.

30:40.720 --> 30:44.720
Very bad girl, bad girl, very naughty.

30:44.720 --> 30:49.720
But I think that my preference in video games is a zoom out angle.

30:49.720 --> 30:54.720
It might be related to that because, yeah.

30:54.720 --> 31:00.720
But hey, does anyone know the full name of the game and it's on Steam?

31:00.720 --> 31:05.720
I don't even know if it's on Steam.

31:05.720 --> 31:09.720
It is called James Cameron's Avatar.

31:09.720 --> 31:12.720
Okay, the Navi can go through these doors.

31:12.720 --> 31:14.720
Nope, only when they're green.

31:14.720 --> 31:16.720
Okay, sure, sure.

31:16.720 --> 31:18.720
We are about to encounter the wildlife.

31:18.720 --> 31:24.720
They will still attack us even if we are Navi and RDA does not matter.

31:24.720 --> 31:26.720
Where the heck am I going?

31:26.720 --> 31:27.720
I'm going the wrong way.

31:27.720 --> 31:29.720
That's why I'm getting turned around.

31:29.720 --> 31:31.720
Now, again, we do have superpowers.

31:31.720 --> 31:32.720
We have sprint.

31:32.720 --> 31:33.720
We have invincibility.

31:33.720 --> 31:38.720
We have health and we have ground smash, which is very good.

31:38.720 --> 31:46.720
In order to get healing, if you look on when that health bar comes up again,

31:46.720 --> 31:52.720
you'll notice the number zero at the bottom left on the right side of the health bar that appears bottom left.

31:52.720 --> 31:57.720
The more cell samples we pick up, the more second chances we have.

31:57.720 --> 32:01.720
Now, it's very common to run out of health in this game.

32:01.720 --> 32:03.720
It's just the thing that happens.

32:03.720 --> 32:04.720
It's not a big deal.

32:04.720 --> 32:06.720
Again, the game's very forgiving.

32:06.720 --> 32:11.720
You can literally do this all the way through the game and anything can hardly hit you.

32:11.720 --> 32:16.720
But the later sections of the game, I don't know if there weren't many playtesters

32:16.720 --> 32:19.720
because it was very rough in the later sections of the game.

32:19.720 --> 32:21.720
I have to admit, it's getting pretty rough.

32:21.720 --> 32:25.720
We are going to unlock this Tree of Vision, so now we can teleport to this region

32:25.720 --> 32:28.720
when we come back to 100% the region.

32:28.720 --> 32:30.720
You must be rider.

32:30.720 --> 32:32.720
Let's get you up to speed.

32:32.720 --> 32:34.720
How many games do you have lined up?

32:34.720 --> 32:35.720
My apologies.

32:35.720 --> 32:37.720
Do you mean to play in general?

32:37.720 --> 32:45.720
If you mean games overall, like daily streaming games for a year?

32:45.720 --> 32:47.720
Question mark.

32:47.720 --> 32:51.720
Next week in endurance is Skyrim.

32:51.720 --> 32:53.720
It's another childhood game of mine.

32:53.720 --> 33:00.720
I used to do 100% achievements in Skyrim every year because I really appreciate the game and its vanilla form.

33:00.720 --> 33:04.720
I do apologize if you like mods, but I don't know what to say.

33:04.720 --> 33:06.720
Now we're among friends.

33:06.720 --> 33:09.720
We aren't friends, so you need to learn quick.

33:09.720 --> 33:11.720
We aren't friends?

33:11.720 --> 33:13.720
Figure that out.

33:13.720 --> 33:17.720
Would you guys, you know, would you guys really view?

33:17.720 --> 33:19.720
What? 100?

33:19.720 --> 33:21.720
You are one cool gal.

33:21.720 --> 33:25.720
Fell in love when you started playing all my favorite games.

33:25.720 --> 33:28.720
Also humans number one baby.

33:28.720 --> 33:29.720
No!

33:29.720 --> 33:31.720
I used to tactical strike every navi, every chance I got.

33:31.720 --> 33:32.720
Anonymous!

33:32.720 --> 33:33.720
No!

33:33.720 --> 33:34.720
Bad boy!

33:34.720 --> 33:35.720
Bad boy!

33:35.720 --> 33:37.720
Thank you for the 100.

33:37.720 --> 33:38.720
That's a lot of money though.

33:38.720 --> 33:41.720
Please make sure you're looking after yourself and treating yourself.

33:41.720 --> 33:42.720
100 is a lot.

33:42.720 --> 33:43.720
Jesus.

33:43.720 --> 33:44.720
Bad and on.

33:44.720 --> 33:45.720
Bad boy.

33:45.720 --> 33:47.720
Come get spankens right now.

33:47.720 --> 33:48.720
Bad.

33:50.720 --> 33:52.720
Let me take a sipping tin.

33:52.720 --> 33:54.720
Are you squiddin' me right now?

33:54.720 --> 33:55.720
Goodness me.

33:55.720 --> 33:58.720
Can't believe the reflings are betraying mama like this.

33:58.720 --> 33:59.720
SMH.

33:59.720 --> 34:00.720
Exactly, Nero.

34:00.720 --> 34:02.720
Don't worry though, strongy.

34:02.720 --> 34:04.720
I'll never betray nature.

34:04.720 --> 34:05.720
Must protect the navi.

34:05.720 --> 34:07.720
Exactly, we stand nature in this house.

34:07.720 --> 34:08.720
We will look after nature.

34:08.720 --> 34:13.720
As you see me, you can literally hear me dancing about in my chair right now.

34:13.720 --> 34:17.720
So we are, what the heck is that zone?

34:17.720 --> 34:18.720
And why is it so big?

34:18.720 --> 34:19.720
Oh, we're plant sampling.

34:19.720 --> 34:22.720
Okay, this is tutorial section.

34:22.720 --> 34:24.720
When I explained, thank you for the tip again, Nero.

34:24.720 --> 34:28.720
Anonymous, my goodness, that was a lot of money.

34:28.720 --> 34:30.720
Play, is something attacking me?

34:30.720 --> 34:31.720
No.

34:31.720 --> 34:35.720
When you pick up cell samples, there's that little white bar on the left side.

34:35.720 --> 34:39.720
I didn't, and you thought there was enemies because I was like, why am I getting, playing

34:39.720 --> 34:40.720
as an avatar?

34:40.720 --> 34:54.720
As an avatar, pondora's flora, which means flowers, and fauna means animals.

34:54.720 --> 34:55.720
Yes.

34:55.720 --> 35:00.720
As less aggressive towards you, therefore, killing and offensive creatures and plants

35:00.720 --> 35:04.720
will not yield experience points.

35:04.720 --> 35:09.720
All the reeflings siding with humans want to be the guy from strongy's lore video.

35:09.720 --> 35:10.720
Oh, I'm so bad.

35:10.720 --> 35:13.720
Hope a siren doesn't drown me in the ocean.

35:13.720 --> 35:14.720
Thank you.

35:14.720 --> 35:17.720
Thank you, Anonymous, for the tip.

35:17.720 --> 35:22.720
Oh, you guys don't want me to, you know, take you down in the waters with me, that's not.

35:22.720 --> 35:24.720
Honestly, my lore is so evil.

35:24.720 --> 35:28.720
I promise, I don't want to, I don't want to hurt.

35:28.720 --> 35:29.720
What?

35:29.720 --> 35:31.720
Why do I suck so bad at this?

35:31.720 --> 35:33.720
Wait, what was that?

35:33.720 --> 35:36.720
No way, they have a slow motion kill cam.

35:36.720 --> 35:40.720
I did not recall that whatsoever.

35:40.720 --> 35:42.720
That's amazing.

35:42.720 --> 35:44.720
Don't threaten us with a good time.

35:44.720 --> 35:46.720
That sounds very yandere-esque.

35:46.720 --> 35:49.720
But yeah, in terms of evilness in lore, why?

35:49.720 --> 35:50.720
What was that?

35:50.720 --> 35:51.720
I heard that.

35:52.720 --> 35:53.720
I can hear it.

35:53.720 --> 35:55.720
I actually got scared there.

35:55.720 --> 35:59.720
I heard it, but I couldn't turn the analog stick in time.

35:59.720 --> 36:01.720
So if I am human-

36:02.720 --> 36:05.720
Why are there so many?

36:05.720 --> 36:07.720
Oh no, I heard the plant.

36:07.720 --> 36:09.720
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, Mr. Plant.

36:09.720 --> 36:11.720
I'm actually getting a bit scared.

36:11.720 --> 36:13.720
Why is there so many?

36:13.720 --> 36:16.720
Wait, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.

36:16.720 --> 36:17.720
Pause.

36:17.720 --> 36:19.720
Pause, I hear more.

36:19.720 --> 36:21.720
Oh my god, they're literally biting my ankles.

36:21.720 --> 36:23.720
They're biting my ankles.

36:23.720 --> 36:27.720
Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.

36:27.720 --> 36:29.720
Stop.

36:29.720 --> 36:31.720
Okay, relax.

36:31.720 --> 36:34.720
Relax or just collect and sell samples in this area.

36:34.720 --> 36:36.720
I think I've hurt every...

36:36.720 --> 36:38.720
All the enemies are gone.

36:38.720 --> 36:41.720
Yeah, so these type animals don't attack.

36:41.720 --> 36:44.720
They can't bite my ankles, man.

36:44.720 --> 36:46.720
If you are human and come across this plant,

36:46.720 --> 36:48.720
it is very poisonous.

36:48.720 --> 36:52.720
It spits a bale at you, which is actually really cool.

36:52.720 --> 36:56.720
But the design elements that went into this game

36:56.720 --> 36:58.720
is just beautiful.

37:04.720 --> 37:07.720
But yeah, the development, you can actually...

37:07.720 --> 37:09.720
Yeah, you can scan...

37:09.720 --> 37:11.720
Who goes there?

37:11.720 --> 37:15.720
You can scan stuff and add it to a database and that.

37:15.720 --> 37:17.720
I've never 100% of that.

37:18.720 --> 37:21.720
Oh no, we can't because I would have to play the RDA side.

37:21.720 --> 37:23.720
But I'm not playing the bad boy side.

37:23.720 --> 37:26.720
But yeah, if you're into 100% completion,

37:26.720 --> 37:28.720
absolutely you can do that kind of thing.

37:34.720 --> 37:38.720
But it is a very beautiful game.

37:38.720 --> 37:41.720
I am very much into alternative...

37:43.720 --> 37:46.720
I saw that, it popped up my little thingies.

37:46.720 --> 37:48.720
I knew it.

37:56.720 --> 37:59.720
We can do this and just kind of try and bypass

37:59.720 --> 38:01.720
all the enemies on the way.

38:01.720 --> 38:03.720
Enemies.

38:03.720 --> 38:05.720
Did you watch the second movie?

38:05.720 --> 38:07.720
I absolutely did.

38:07.720 --> 38:11.720
I thoroughly enjoyed the first movie with Jake Sully.

38:11.720 --> 38:13.720
Absolutely.

38:13.720 --> 38:15.720
I love your names, Jake, by the way.

38:17.720 --> 38:20.720
Absolutely fantastic movies.

38:20.720 --> 38:23.720
Completely captured me in that kind of fantasy,

38:23.720 --> 38:27.720
different world, especially the night time scenes

38:27.720 --> 38:29.720
when everything is lighting up.

38:29.720 --> 38:32.720
Speaking of lighting up, hold on.

38:36.720 --> 38:38.720
Reactive model, you ready?

38:38.720 --> 38:40.720
Reactive model, do you want this?

38:40.720 --> 38:42.720
Or do you want my normal model?

38:42.720 --> 38:44.720
I can turn over in it.

38:44.720 --> 38:46.720
The bioluminescence scenes.

38:46.720 --> 38:48.720
Yes, bioluminescence scenes.

38:50.720 --> 38:53.720
Pushing boots to destroyed Avatar 2 in the box office.

38:53.720 --> 38:54.720
Nah.

38:57.720 --> 39:00.720
Woo, our first meet with a navi.

39:00.720 --> 39:02.720
Like an actual navi, not an RDA navi.

39:03.720 --> 39:04.720
Are you ready?

39:04.720 --> 39:06.720
Hello, Tanjala.

39:06.720 --> 39:10.720
Oh, I'm stuck on this corpse of a theme of Ober.

39:10.720 --> 39:11.720
Hello.

39:11.720 --> 39:13.720
Hello, I'm on a kayak.

39:18.720 --> 39:20.720
This is good.

39:24.720 --> 39:27.720
Oh, Renee Harper is a corny weaver.

39:27.720 --> 39:29.720
She's been poused with a navi.

39:29.720 --> 39:30.720
She overslept them.

39:30.720 --> 39:35.720
Tanjala wants you to kill the sick, strong beasts.

39:35.720 --> 39:38.720
Anyone else identify themselves as a strong beast?

39:39.720 --> 39:41.720
That's ridiculous.

39:41.720 --> 39:44.720
We're really starting to dig hard for these words.

39:46.720 --> 39:48.720
Avatar 2 had no story at all.

39:48.720 --> 39:50.720
A perfect how not to make a sequel.

39:50.720 --> 39:52.720
I disagree.

39:52.720 --> 39:53.720
Brian!

39:57.720 --> 39:58.720
Exactly!

39:59.720 --> 40:01.720
Exactly, Grimble.

40:01.720 --> 40:03.720
Thank you for the tip.

40:03.720 --> 40:04.720
We do, Brian.

40:08.720 --> 40:10.720
I have not seen fair and golly.

40:10.720 --> 40:11.720
Bajinga!

40:11.720 --> 40:12.720
Thank you for the tip.

40:12.720 --> 40:13.720
What's fair and golly?

40:13.720 --> 40:15.720
Have you guys seen fair and golly?

40:15.720 --> 40:18.720
Are you doing what you eat?

40:18.720 --> 40:21.720
You like Sigourney Weaver a lot.

40:21.720 --> 40:25.720
So, Sigourney Weaver, the first thing I've seen her in.

40:25.720 --> 40:27.720
Oh, we're just to destroy these, by the way.

40:27.720 --> 40:31.720
Sigourney Weaver Avatar was the first thing I ever saw her in.

40:31.720 --> 40:33.720
And I just adored her.

40:33.720 --> 40:34.720
I adored her character.

40:34.720 --> 40:37.720
Her voice is so lovely as well.

40:37.720 --> 40:39.720
It's such a...

40:39.720 --> 40:41.720
If you ever struggle at this point,

40:41.720 --> 40:43.720
just jump up on this rock right here.

40:43.720 --> 40:44.720
They can't...

40:44.720 --> 40:45.720
Oh!

40:45.720 --> 40:47.720
They can't hurt you if you go on the rock.

40:47.720 --> 40:48.720
They can't do a thing.

40:48.720 --> 40:50.720
If you're on the floor, these guys will knock you over

40:50.720 --> 40:53.720
and take a big chunk of your health.

40:53.720 --> 40:55.720
Is something else attacking me?

40:55.720 --> 40:56.720
No.

40:57.720 --> 40:59.720
But we're good to go.

41:01.720 --> 41:03.720
Robin Williams plays a bat in this.

41:07.720 --> 41:11.720
Fair and golly is basically the Barbie Pixie...

41:11.720 --> 41:14.720
The Barbie Pixie movie in 2D, but human...

41:14.720 --> 41:15.720
What?

41:15.720 --> 41:17.720
And humans are bad guys.

41:17.720 --> 41:18.720
It was a good movie.

41:18.720 --> 41:21.720
The direct to VHS sequel was...

41:21.720 --> 41:22.720
Okay.

41:24.720 --> 41:25.720
Tim Curry sings.

41:26.720 --> 41:28.720
Oh my god, Rocky Horror Picture Show.

41:28.720 --> 41:30.720
You put your hands on your leg.

41:30.720 --> 41:32.720
No, that's not right.

41:32.720 --> 41:33.720
You put your hands on your hips.

41:33.720 --> 41:34.720
That's it.

41:34.720 --> 41:36.720
I find a dance inside.

41:40.720 --> 41:41.720
We should watch that.

41:41.720 --> 41:44.720
My mum really likes that movie.

41:44.720 --> 41:46.720
So I've watched it from a young age.

41:46.720 --> 41:49.720
Yeah, it's absolutely bizarre to conceptualise

41:49.720 --> 41:52.720
what on earth happens in that movie at a young age.

41:52.720 --> 41:53.720
But hey ho!

41:53.720 --> 41:54.720
That's just life.

41:54.720 --> 41:55.720
That's just how it is.

41:55.720 --> 41:56.720
We're going to...

41:56.720 --> 41:57.720
Oh!

41:57.720 --> 41:58.720
I heard.

41:58.720 --> 41:59.720
Butta dog.

41:59.720 --> 42:00.720
Dog with a butta.

42:00.720 --> 42:01.720
I heard that.

42:01.720 --> 42:02.720
And mama.

42:02.720 --> 42:04.720
Get your butt to the top of that.

42:04.720 --> 42:05.720
I want that.

42:05.720 --> 42:07.720
What are you doing here?

42:07.720 --> 42:08.720
I'm so tainy.

42:08.720 --> 42:10.720
Oh no, I'm so big.

42:10.720 --> 42:12.720
POV, you're Azura?

42:12.720 --> 42:14.720
You're talking to Azura right now.

42:14.720 --> 42:16.720
This is the hate difference between you and Azura.

42:16.720 --> 42:17.720
What's going on?

42:17.720 --> 42:18.720
I'm shutting down the knob.

42:18.720 --> 42:19.720
It's Emmy and Azura.

42:21.720 --> 42:23.720
Oh, we Emmy.

42:24.720 --> 42:26.720
A giant woman.

42:26.720 --> 42:28.720
No, don't lie.

42:28.720 --> 42:31.720
Don't lie right now.

42:31.720 --> 42:35.720
And say to me, I didn't cook with making Azura a giantess.

42:35.720 --> 42:37.720
I will not take...

42:37.720 --> 42:38.720
Right, if that's not going to hurt me,

42:38.720 --> 42:39.720
I'm actually just going to leg it.

42:39.720 --> 42:40.720
I'm legging it, boys.

42:40.720 --> 42:41.720
We're doing it.

42:41.720 --> 42:42.720
We're doing it.

42:42.720 --> 42:43.720
We're doing it.

42:43.720 --> 42:44.720
Oh!

42:44.720 --> 42:45.720
Wah!

42:45.720 --> 42:46.720
Wah!

42:46.720 --> 42:49.720
Right, we're just going to stealth through this section.

42:49.720 --> 42:51.720
There's a lot of dire wolves.

42:51.720 --> 42:53.720
Eh, viper wolves.

42:53.720 --> 42:56.720
However, we're no interested in fighting.

42:56.720 --> 42:58.720
So, we're just going to zoom past

42:58.720 --> 43:02.720
because this entire section is optional, honestly.

43:02.720 --> 43:04.720
We're just going to zoom ahead again.

43:06.720 --> 43:07.720
Cooked.

43:07.720 --> 43:08.720
You did indeed cook.

43:08.720 --> 43:12.720
No, I knew I wanted some sort of thick Vtuber model.

43:12.720 --> 43:14.720
I'm sorry, I'm going to say it.

43:14.720 --> 43:17.720
There's really not that much variety for the thick

43:17.720 --> 43:19.720
and for the chocolate.

43:20.720 --> 43:23.720
So, it was just absolutely no questions asked.

43:23.720 --> 43:25.720
Probably going to do the same in Gen 2

43:25.720 --> 43:28.720
where, you know, something's going to be lovely in Gen 2.

43:28.720 --> 43:29.720
Brian!

43:29.720 --> 43:31.720
Didn't expect Sigourney Weaver to side

43:31.720 --> 43:34.720
with the Navi considering her history with aliens.

43:37.720 --> 43:39.720
Is she the main...

43:39.720 --> 43:41.720
Is she the main alien?

43:41.720 --> 43:43.720
Because I remember reading a really...

43:43.720 --> 43:45.720
Oh, we're on a horse, by the way.

43:45.720 --> 43:46.720
Check it out.

43:46.720 --> 43:47.720
Look at my horse.

43:47.720 --> 43:49.720
My horse is amazing.

43:49.720 --> 43:51.720
Oh my God, its face is all...

43:51.720 --> 43:54.720
That's a really unfortunate face.

43:54.720 --> 43:56.720
Everything else, yeah, that's all right.

43:57.720 --> 43:58.720
Look, I'm riding a pony.

43:58.720 --> 43:59.720
I'm such a girl.

44:01.720 --> 44:03.720
Oh my God, this is the girls game as well.

44:03.720 --> 44:04.720
Oh, no.

44:04.720 --> 44:05.720
Oh, there's actually really...

44:05.720 --> 44:06.720
This is really boring,

44:06.720 --> 44:08.720
but when we come back to this section later,

44:08.720 --> 44:10.720
an enemy always spawns on this rock

44:10.720 --> 44:13.720
and he's infinite stuck and you can never, like, hurt him.

44:15.720 --> 44:16.720
Okay.

44:17.720 --> 44:18.720
It's time.

44:18.720 --> 44:20.720
We need to make a decision.

44:20.720 --> 44:21.720
Are we Navi?

44:21.720 --> 44:23.720
Thank you very much, Iron Reaper, for the tip.

44:23.720 --> 44:26.720
I think I actually forgot to say that, but thank you for the tip.

44:26.720 --> 44:28.720
Are you squiddin' me right now?

44:28.720 --> 44:29.720
Nero!

44:29.720 --> 44:32.720
Speaking of, how tall is Stacy Milketon?

44:34.720 --> 44:36.720
Thank you, Nero, for the tip.

44:38.720 --> 44:42.720
So we are a signal specialist

44:42.720 --> 44:44.720
and we've set those signals up,

44:44.720 --> 44:46.720
but we were told that they weren't gonna...

44:46.720 --> 44:49.720
It wasn't gonna be used for destroying Navi.

44:50.720 --> 44:52.720
Nori, nori.

44:54.720 --> 44:55.720
Ah!

45:17.720 --> 45:20.720
So we're learning we just destroyed all the Navi's home.

45:23.720 --> 45:24.720
It's work.

45:34.720 --> 45:36.720
Are we the baddies?

45:43.720 --> 45:44.720
Raider?

45:44.720 --> 45:46.720
Hardly even nor.

45:48.720 --> 45:50.720
Oh wait, sorry, sorry, hold on, do that again.

45:51.720 --> 45:52.720
Raider?

45:52.720 --> 45:54.720
Hardly even nor.

46:06.720 --> 46:08.720
Come on, how goofy is that?

46:09.720 --> 46:11.720
I wanted to see...

46:11.720 --> 46:12.720
Raider, are you ready?

46:12.720 --> 46:13.720
Are you ready?

46:13.720 --> 46:14.720
We're gonna do it again.

46:16.720 --> 46:18.720
Okay, hold on, let's do this bit

46:18.720 --> 46:20.720
and then when we're mucking about I'll do it again, okay?

46:20.720 --> 46:21.720
That was amazing.

46:23.720 --> 46:26.720
Right, so this is where you decide.

46:26.720 --> 46:28.720
Do you want to be Navi or do you want to be RDA?

46:28.720 --> 46:30.720
If I shoot him, we become RDA.

46:30.720 --> 46:34.720
If I shoot him, we become Navi

46:34.720 --> 46:36.720
and defend this Pandora

46:36.720 --> 46:38.720
in the name of being a foreigner.

46:38.720 --> 46:39.720
We need to kill it.

46:39.720 --> 46:40.720
We guys first go.

46:41.720 --> 46:42.720
Destroy him.

46:42.720 --> 46:43.720
Just...

46:43.720 --> 46:44.720
Oh, I'm low health.

46:44.720 --> 46:46.720
Oh my God, I'm farting about too much.

46:46.720 --> 46:47.720
Oh, why is he so strong?

46:47.720 --> 46:48.720
Right, go.

46:49.720 --> 46:51.720
Wait, I'm actually gonna get...

46:51.720 --> 46:53.720
I think I'm actually gonna perish.

46:53.720 --> 46:55.720
He's like actually wrecking and decking me.

46:55.720 --> 46:56.720
What's going on?

46:57.720 --> 46:58.720
Why is his health not going down?

46:58.720 --> 47:00.720
Why is my aim bought so bad?

47:01.720 --> 47:03.720
Right, hold on, hold on.

47:03.720 --> 47:05.720
Hold on, let me aim bought.

47:05.720 --> 47:06.720
He healed up!

47:06.720 --> 47:08.720
No, no!

47:08.720 --> 47:10.720
Only I'm allowed to heal up.

47:11.720 --> 47:13.720
The enemies shouldn't be allowed to heal up.

47:13.720 --> 47:15.720
It should be illegal in video games.

47:15.720 --> 47:18.720
Development team, you have failed.

47:18.720 --> 47:19.720
It should be...

47:19.720 --> 47:21.720
Why is he only shooting me as well?

47:21.720 --> 47:23.720
Can you like shoot that other guy?

47:23.720 --> 47:24.720
Right, hold on.

47:24.720 --> 47:26.720
Let me readjust this aim bought.

47:26.720 --> 47:27.720
No, he healed up!

47:27.720 --> 47:29.720
Only I'm supposed to be healed up!

47:29.720 --> 47:30.720
Right, that's it.

47:31.720 --> 47:32.720
Grim pound!

47:33.720 --> 47:34.720
It didn't even work.

47:34.720 --> 47:35.720
Did it work?

47:35.720 --> 47:36.720
I don't know.

47:36.720 --> 47:37.720
I'm gonna be honest.

47:37.720 --> 47:39.720
This is a few too many bullets are going through you.

47:39.720 --> 47:41.720
I spoke too many bullets.

47:41.720 --> 47:42.720
Sudden darts.

47:43.720 --> 47:45.720
He survived all those bullets.

47:49.720 --> 47:50.720
I gotta go now.

47:50.720 --> 47:51.720
Grab your dire horse.

47:52.720 --> 47:53.720
Dire horse?

47:53.720 --> 47:54.720
Banshee!

47:56.720 --> 47:58.720
Ik-nee-ma-ya.

47:58.720 --> 48:00.720
Ik-nu-ee-ma-ya.

48:00.720 --> 48:02.720
No idea who I'm supposed to see.

48:02.720 --> 48:03.720
Ik-nee-ma-ya.

48:03.720 --> 48:05.720
Ik-nee-ma-ya.

48:05.720 --> 48:07.720
Sounds like I'm trying to say something in the dark.

48:07.720 --> 48:09.720
The RDA doesn't do anything piecemeal.

48:10.720 --> 48:11.720
Ik-kawanyo?

48:12.720 --> 48:13.720
It's not Ik-kawanyu.

48:16.720 --> 48:18.720
Got anything better than bows and arrows?

48:19.720 --> 48:20.720
They defend their homeland.

48:20.720 --> 48:22.720
Those are the only weapons they need.

48:22.720 --> 48:23.720
Great.

48:23.720 --> 48:24.720
Good choice, Ryder.

48:24.720 --> 48:25.720
Ik-nee-ma-ya.

48:25.720 --> 48:26.720
That's what I'm saying now.

48:27.720 --> 48:29.720
Couldn't humans kill the main guys?

48:29.720 --> 48:30.720
Human body in the machines?

48:30.720 --> 48:31.720
Yes.

48:31.720 --> 48:32.720
That's very true.

48:32.720 --> 48:35.720
But it was arranged that the...

48:35.720 --> 48:36.720
Look out!

48:36.720 --> 48:37.720
Oh, look out!

48:37.720 --> 48:38.720
We stunning on them.

48:38.720 --> 48:39.720
Look at this.

48:39.720 --> 48:41.720
Got a little outfit of the day moment check.

48:42.720 --> 48:43.720
Come on.

48:43.720 --> 48:45.720
Look at my jewel-wield blades.

48:45.720 --> 48:46.720
Come on.

48:46.720 --> 48:47.720
That's so cool.

48:47.720 --> 48:48.720
Oh, how did I hit?

48:49.720 --> 48:50.720
That's so cool.

48:50.720 --> 48:51.720
Come on.

48:51.720 --> 48:52.720
That's so cool.

48:52.720 --> 48:53.720
I'm sorry, but look how cool that...

48:53.720 --> 48:54.720
Oh, my God!

48:54.720 --> 48:55.720
That's terrifying.

48:55.720 --> 48:56.720
Imagine that running at you.

48:58.720 --> 49:01.720
Oh, I just cracked myself right there.

49:02.720 --> 49:05.720
Your avatar isn't blonde because blonde doesn't exist in Navi.

49:05.720 --> 49:06.720
I don't think...

49:06.720 --> 49:07.720
Maybe it does.

49:07.720 --> 49:08.720
I don't know.

49:08.720 --> 49:09.720
I don't think I've recall seen a blonde Navi.

49:09.720 --> 49:10.720
Oh, no.

49:10.720 --> 49:12.720
I do in the different regions of...

49:12.720 --> 49:14.720
But we are jungle Navi.

49:14.720 --> 49:15.720
This is jungle Navi.

49:15.720 --> 49:17.720
There's different types of Navi.

49:18.720 --> 49:19.720
Or jungle Navi.

49:23.720 --> 49:25.720
Sadly, not closer to your level plus.

49:39.720 --> 49:41.720
We need to win his approval.

49:43.720 --> 49:44.720
Oh, my God.

49:44.720 --> 49:45.720
She's so real for that.

49:45.720 --> 49:46.720
That's...

49:50.720 --> 49:53.720
Okay, we need to try and get the approval of this guy.

49:54.720 --> 49:55.720
Why?

49:56.720 --> 49:59.720
I've already forgotten the plot, but we're going to do it anyway.

50:00.720 --> 50:02.720
But basically, we are full Navi right now,

50:02.720 --> 50:04.720
and I'm going to tell you something.

50:04.720 --> 50:06.720
Okay, this really is a girls game,

50:06.720 --> 50:08.720
because every time we go to the next location,

50:08.720 --> 50:10.720
we unlock new outfits as we level up,

50:10.720 --> 50:12.720
and I get to like play a little wardrobe simulator.

50:12.720 --> 50:13.720
Such a girls game.

50:13.720 --> 50:14.720
That's such a girls game.

50:19.720 --> 50:22.720
Yeah, he ain't happy at all to see me in.

50:24.720 --> 50:27.720
Oh, I need to be able to raid a Banshee or an Ikran.

50:27.720 --> 50:28.720
That's what they're called.

50:31.720 --> 50:32.720
Oh, my God.

50:32.720 --> 50:33.720
Blanky.

50:33.720 --> 50:34.720
Hold on.

50:34.720 --> 50:35.720
I need to get what's the link,

50:35.720 --> 50:36.720
because I'm hurting my legs against the table.

50:36.720 --> 50:37.720
Ooh.

50:37.720 --> 50:38.720
Did I just skip dialogue down that?

50:38.720 --> 50:39.720
Oopsie daisy.

50:40.720 --> 50:41.720
New outfits.

50:41.720 --> 50:42.720
Let's go to the next area.

50:42.720 --> 50:43.720
Oh, my God.

50:43.720 --> 50:44.720
Fashion Simulator.

50:44.720 --> 50:46.720
We played Landlord Simulator on Brotherhood.

50:46.720 --> 50:49.720
Now we're playing Fashion Simulator on Avatar.

50:50.720 --> 50:51.720
Right.

50:51.720 --> 50:55.720
We are about to learn a motherfucking bow and arrow.

50:56.720 --> 50:58.720
Oh, did not mean to do that one.

50:58.720 --> 50:59.720
Let's try that again.

50:59.720 --> 51:00.720
Pardon me.

51:00.720 --> 51:01.720
Excuse me.

51:01.720 --> 51:02.720
That was very daft.

51:02.720 --> 51:04.720
I just absolutely threw myself off the mat there.

51:05.720 --> 51:07.720
How does zooming on the bow and arrow again?

51:07.720 --> 51:08.720
Not that one.

51:09.720 --> 51:10.720
Oh, wow.

51:10.720 --> 51:11.720
It's just hold and release.

51:11.720 --> 51:12.720
Okay.

51:12.720 --> 51:13.720
Who would have thought?

51:14.720 --> 51:15.720
Who would have thought?

51:15.720 --> 51:16.720
It's just holding release.

51:17.720 --> 51:19.720
The Navi's drip is indeed real true.

51:20.720 --> 51:23.720
This game seems surprisingly competent, actually.

51:23.720 --> 51:24.720
I was doubting.

51:24.720 --> 51:25.720
I get game.

51:25.720 --> 51:26.720
It is.

51:26.720 --> 51:27.720
Honestly, I get game.

51:27.720 --> 51:28.720
Wait.

51:28.720 --> 51:29.720
What am I doing?

51:29.720 --> 51:32.720
Oh, we're doing our first human kill.

51:32.720 --> 51:33.720
Oh.

51:35.720 --> 51:36.720
Yeah.

51:36.720 --> 51:38.720
The aim is very forgiving.

51:38.720 --> 51:40.720
If you want an easy game.

51:40.720 --> 51:43.720
Definitely recommend this game.

51:43.720 --> 51:46.720
The bow and arrow is very satisfactory.

51:46.720 --> 51:48.720
But I'll tell you one thing though.

51:49.720 --> 51:50.720
Oh, look at this camera.

51:50.720 --> 51:52.720
Look how terrible this camera like pings off of different.

51:52.720 --> 51:58.720
Like you can see the markers of where they put the tracking to do that.

51:58.720 --> 51:59.720
Like it's not smooth.

51:59.720 --> 52:00.720
Like.

52:01.720 --> 52:02.720
Oh my God.

52:02.720 --> 52:03.720
Who goes there?

52:04.720 --> 52:05.720
Identify yourself.

52:07.720 --> 52:08.720
I need to jump.

52:10.720 --> 52:13.720
First human after killing two low level.

52:13.720 --> 52:14.720
So actually true.

52:14.720 --> 52:16.720
I just recalled that.

52:16.720 --> 52:20.720
Really, really willy nilly killing over here.

52:21.720 --> 52:22.720
Any willy killers?

52:22.720 --> 52:23.720
No, don't.

52:24.720 --> 52:27.720
This is another armor we kind of get to unlock about later on.

52:27.720 --> 52:28.720
It's not quite the same.

52:29.720 --> 52:34.720
But here we speak to bar a word for it.

52:41.720 --> 52:44.720
I hear you betrayed your own kind to be here.

52:44.720 --> 52:45.720
Yeah.

52:45.720 --> 52:47.720
How soon will you betray us?

52:48.720 --> 52:50.720
It will take more than this offering.

52:50.720 --> 52:52.720
The scale of the arrows are massive they are.

52:52.720 --> 52:54.720
Like Navi are so big.

52:58.720 --> 53:00.720
So there wasn't a big tree in the game?

53:00.720 --> 53:03.720
Oh, we aren't at the end of the game yet.

53:03.720 --> 53:05.720
You just hold on to that thought.

53:05.720 --> 53:07.720
You're a couple of missions ahead.

53:07.720 --> 53:09.720
But I like doing this.

53:15.720 --> 53:18.720
They don't disconnect us for treason, honestly.

53:21.720 --> 53:24.720
She wants the braid tails?

53:25.720 --> 53:27.720
What happens if we braid tails with each other?

53:29.720 --> 53:30.720
Is that like a marriage proposal?

53:30.720 --> 53:31.720
Is that Navi?

53:31.720 --> 53:32.720
We braid each other's?

53:38.720 --> 53:39.720
He will not show it.

53:39.720 --> 53:40.720
Oh, that's his wife?

53:43.720 --> 53:45.720
Come, we must destroy Sky Tower.

53:46.720 --> 53:47.720
We find these.

53:48.720 --> 53:49.720
How will you say?

53:49.720 --> 53:50.720
Take care.

53:51.720 --> 53:52.720
Will you help us?

53:52.720 --> 53:54.720
These boxes are explosives.

53:54.720 --> 53:55.720
TNT?

53:56.720 --> 53:57.720
Yes.

53:57.720 --> 53:58.720
We have word for this.

53:59.720 --> 54:00.720
Kangangang.

54:01.720 --> 54:02.720
Kangangang.

54:02.720 --> 54:03.720
Oh, that's so satisfying to say.

54:03.720 --> 54:04.720
Kangangang.

54:08.720 --> 54:09.720
Is that a TNT?

54:09.720 --> 54:10.720
Kangangang.

54:11.720 --> 54:12.720
I messed with that.

54:12.720 --> 54:15.720
You can flip into the waterfall to get down here a bit faster

54:15.720 --> 54:17.720
than going all the way around the map.

54:18.720 --> 54:19.720
I will heal.

54:19.720 --> 54:20.720
I shouldn't have done that.

54:20.720 --> 54:23.720
I thought you could slip down without too much.

54:23.720 --> 54:25.720
Oh, you have 50 bow.

54:25.720 --> 54:27.720
And every time you get a sample,

54:27.720 --> 54:30.720
you replenish your bow and arrow ammunition.

54:30.720 --> 54:33.720
So all those green is more bows.

54:35.720 --> 54:36.720
Genghis Khan?

54:36.720 --> 54:37.720
Okay.

54:37.720 --> 54:38.720
You're done.

54:40.720 --> 54:41.720
Excuse me.

54:41.720 --> 54:42.720
Pardon me.

54:42.720 --> 54:43.720
Coming through.

54:43.720 --> 54:44.720
You guys can't aim.

54:44.720 --> 54:45.720
Oh, I can't aim either.

54:45.720 --> 54:46.720
It's fine.

54:46.720 --> 54:47.720
Okay.

54:47.720 --> 54:49.720
I think because my keyboard is registering.

54:49.720 --> 54:50.720
Hello?

54:51.720 --> 54:52.720
Hello?

54:53.720 --> 54:54.720
Okay.

54:54.720 --> 54:56.720
I think because my keyboard is registering,

54:56.720 --> 55:01.720
the aim assist isn't being as active as it is normally

55:01.720 --> 55:04.720
on Xbox.

55:04.720 --> 55:07.720
Because I could have sworn I didn't even have to aim.

55:09.720 --> 55:10.720
Conta.

55:12.720 --> 55:13.720
Jeez.

55:13.720 --> 55:14.720
They just disappear.

55:14.720 --> 55:15.720
Okay.

55:15.720 --> 55:18.720
We seem to get either 5 or 10 arrows from samples,

55:18.720 --> 55:20.720
which is pretty good.

55:20.720 --> 55:21.720
I would say that's pretty good.

55:22.720 --> 55:23.720
Kangangang.

55:23.720 --> 55:25.720
Hans was simulator, actually.

55:25.720 --> 55:27.720
I prefer the born hours myself,

55:27.720 --> 55:29.720
but I'll tell you something that's really sad about this game.

55:30.720 --> 55:32.720
As we level up,

55:32.720 --> 55:35.720
our equipment also becomes stronger in nature.

55:35.720 --> 55:36.720
Okay.

55:36.720 --> 55:37.720
However,

55:37.720 --> 55:41.720
if you did not purchase the special edition,

55:41.720 --> 55:45.720
which they made about 1000 copies of for some unknown reason,

55:45.720 --> 55:48.720
if they didn't do the special,

55:48.720 --> 55:49.720
if you didn't buy it,

55:49.720 --> 55:52.720
your bow does not one-shot the enemies as you level up.

55:52.720 --> 55:54.720
It is complete nonsense.

55:54.720 --> 55:57.720
They made only so few copies.

55:57.720 --> 55:59.720
I was like,

55:59.720 --> 56:02.720
oh, do you see how that flower attack is attacking them

56:02.720 --> 56:05.720
and they're taking poison damage?

56:05.720 --> 56:07.720
So unfortunately,

56:07.720 --> 56:08.720
our bow and arrow,

56:08.720 --> 56:10.720
I can't even see them through the...

56:10.720 --> 56:12.720
Bra, why are you missing?

56:12.720 --> 56:13.720
Bra.

56:14.720 --> 56:17.720
You do heal over time naturally when there's no fight,

56:17.720 --> 56:19.720
so you don't always have to spam heals.

56:19.720 --> 56:20.720
What's this?

56:20.720 --> 56:21.720
What's that?

56:22.720 --> 56:23.720
Ammo.

56:23.720 --> 56:24.720
I thought my ammo...

56:24.720 --> 56:25.720
Whoa!

56:25.720 --> 56:27.720
Wait, what do I have access to?

56:27.720 --> 56:28.720
So dual wields,

56:28.720 --> 56:31.720
one big ass swing,

56:31.720 --> 56:34.720
a gun and a bow, right?

56:34.720 --> 56:36.720
I normally just stick the bow.

56:36.720 --> 56:37.720
Very good.

56:37.720 --> 56:39.720
Very good, very nice.

56:41.720 --> 56:42.720
But overall,

56:42.720 --> 56:44.720
game is very forgiving.

56:45.720 --> 56:47.720
If you're ever interested,

56:47.720 --> 56:48.720
we should do that,

56:48.720 --> 56:49.720
but that comes later.

56:49.720 --> 56:50.720
We'll always come...

56:50.720 --> 56:51.720
Oh!

56:51.720 --> 56:54.720
The acran just said bye to that.

56:54.720 --> 56:56.720
I'm pretty sure they would have got mowed over,

56:56.720 --> 56:57.720
but like,

56:57.720 --> 56:58.720
as long as they're happy,

56:58.720 --> 56:59.720
I'm happy.

57:00.720 --> 57:01.720
So right now,

57:01.720 --> 57:03.720
we're picking up our boom boom Genghis Khan.

57:03.720 --> 57:04.720
Do you mind?

57:05.720 --> 57:06.720
Where did you come from?

57:06.720 --> 57:07.720
You weren't even there.

57:07.720 --> 57:09.720
You're such a liar.

57:09.720 --> 57:10.720
You're lying.

57:11.720 --> 57:12.720
Where are they?

57:12.720 --> 57:13.720
I hear them.

57:15.720 --> 57:16.720
Snipe,

57:16.720 --> 57:17.720
and not snipe.

57:17.720 --> 57:18.720
I am low health.

57:18.720 --> 57:19.720
That's okay.

57:19.720 --> 57:21.720
We're gonna heal up like that.

57:21.720 --> 57:22.720
She can heal up.

57:22.720 --> 57:23.720
And then we're just gonna move.

57:23.720 --> 57:25.720
Oh, we're not gonna move on to the next section.

57:25.720 --> 57:26.720
We're gonna go invisible.

57:26.720 --> 57:28.720
Oh, no, we're not.

57:28.720 --> 57:29.720
Can you still...

57:31.720 --> 57:33.720
I don't know if you saw that.

57:33.720 --> 57:35.720
Those flies were attacking him.

57:35.720 --> 57:36.720
Like literally,

57:36.720 --> 57:38.720
Pandora is so nice to you when you're napping.

57:38.720 --> 57:39.720
I love it.

57:39.720 --> 57:40.720
Oh, I hear them.

57:43.720 --> 57:45.720
Oh, so these are bombs

57:46.720 --> 57:47.720
that fly into you.

57:47.720 --> 57:49.720
I'm pretty sure I heard a guy's voice though.

57:51.720 --> 57:52.720
I'm like 99% sure.

57:52.720 --> 57:54.720
I heard a guy saying they're out there,

57:54.720 --> 57:55.720
but I didn't see it.

57:56.720 --> 57:58.720
I love the way you say jaw wield.

57:58.720 --> 57:59.720
Oh, no.

57:59.720 --> 58:01.720
Wait, does it say differently?

58:01.720 --> 58:02.720
Jew...

58:02.720 --> 58:03.720
Jewel wield?

58:04.720 --> 58:05.720
Jewel weel.

58:06.720 --> 58:07.720
Jewel.

58:08.720 --> 58:10.720
Pandora thinks humans are an infection.

58:10.720 --> 58:11.720
They are.

58:11.720 --> 58:12.720
They're terrible.

58:15.720 --> 58:16.720
When you play RDF,

58:16.720 --> 58:17.720
it's just as truly similar.

58:17.720 --> 58:19.720
Oh, that's hilarious, honestly.

58:22.720 --> 58:24.720
It's such a good game.

58:24.720 --> 58:25.720
Such a good game.

58:25.720 --> 58:27.720
I love this game so much.

58:29.720 --> 58:32.720
The only complaint I have about this game,

58:32.720 --> 58:35.720
it was made when games like to do...

58:35.720 --> 58:36.720
Why?

58:36.720 --> 58:39.720
It's like I have to aim a little to the right.

58:39.720 --> 58:40.720
I do.

58:40.720 --> 58:42.720
I've aimed a little to the right.

58:43.720 --> 58:45.720
We can go down or up.

58:45.720 --> 58:49.720
My memory says up, question mark.

58:50.720 --> 58:53.720
Jewel wield.

58:54.720 --> 58:57.720
Well, my memory was correct.

58:58.720 --> 58:59.720
Oh!

58:59.720 --> 59:01.720
He got a little ambitious

59:01.720 --> 59:03.720
for trying to hurt me there.

59:03.720 --> 59:04.720
Where is this?

59:04.720 --> 59:05.720
It's up there?

59:05.720 --> 59:06.720
Oh, it might be up there.

59:06.720 --> 59:09.720
Whoa, I just spotted you in the corner of my eye.

59:09.720 --> 59:11.720
Yeah, these are literally...

59:11.720 --> 59:13.720
You know, I don't know what they're called.

59:13.720 --> 59:16.720
Those bombs that are for submarines under the water.

59:16.720 --> 59:17.720
I don't know what their name is,

59:17.720 --> 59:19.720
but that's what those are, but in the air.

59:21.720 --> 59:22.720
Oh, I missed.

59:23.720 --> 59:25.720
Yeah, the aimball in this game,

59:25.720 --> 59:26.720
working!

59:27.720 --> 59:28.720
Aimball, please!

59:30.720 --> 59:32.720
Wait, he didn't perish?

59:32.720 --> 59:33.720
Jeez.

59:35.720 --> 59:37.720
It looks like they're...

59:37.720 --> 59:39.720
Oh, we need to shoot that.

59:39.720 --> 59:40.720
Hold on.

59:41.720 --> 59:42.720
Wait, do we actually?

59:44.720 --> 59:46.720
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

59:46.720 --> 59:48.720
Don't remember this part of the game, geez.

59:51.720 --> 59:53.720
What's the rocks for?

59:53.720 --> 59:55.720
Am I to destroy these?

59:56.720 --> 59:57.720
No way.

59:59.720 --> 01:00:01.720
Yeah, so I'm using bullets too.

01:00:02.720 --> 01:00:03.720
Un-ball, un-mort.

01:00:03.720 --> 01:00:06.720
More like, sent-ball, un-mort.

01:00:08.720 --> 01:00:10.720
Why? The aim assist is not like me.

01:00:10.720 --> 01:00:13.720
I'm not actually going to claim that tree of nature.

01:00:13.720 --> 01:00:14.720
That's what...

01:00:15.720 --> 01:00:17.720
The travel point, because...

01:00:18.720 --> 01:00:19.720
Holy crap.

01:00:19.720 --> 01:00:21.720
Oh, no, I don't have unlimited ammo!

01:00:23.720 --> 01:00:25.720
Bruh! I thought I had unlimited ammo!

01:00:27.720 --> 01:00:28.720
Jeez.

01:00:28.720 --> 01:00:30.720
What did that do as a child that made...

01:00:30.720 --> 01:00:32.720
It really must just be the aim assist.

01:00:32.720 --> 01:00:35.720
Because I think if you all one-shot everything,

01:00:35.720 --> 01:00:38.720
there's like no way this stuff is even hurting me half as much.

01:00:38.720 --> 01:00:39.720
Oh, I missed.

01:00:39.720 --> 01:00:41.720
I shot, and I missed again.

01:00:41.720 --> 01:00:43.720
And then I shot, and then I missed again.

01:00:44.720 --> 01:00:45.720
And again.

01:00:45.720 --> 01:00:47.720
I don't know how to unshoot.

01:00:47.720 --> 01:00:48.720
I can't pick up ammo from that.

01:00:48.720 --> 01:00:50.720
I can only pick up ammo shells.

01:00:52.720 --> 01:00:53.720
Honestly!

01:00:53.720 --> 01:00:55.720
Let's see if we can get away with this.

01:00:55.720 --> 01:00:58.720
Because we just need to pick up the package and then go.

01:00:58.720 --> 01:00:59.720
Oh, wow.

01:00:59.720 --> 01:01:00.720
Okay, cutscene time.

01:01:00.720 --> 01:01:01.720
Cutscene time!

01:01:01.720 --> 01:01:02.720
Whoa!

01:01:04.720 --> 01:01:05.720
Gang, gang, gang!

01:01:05.720 --> 01:01:06.720
Gang is gone!

01:01:10.720 --> 01:01:12.720
Okay, let's get the heck out of here,

01:01:12.720 --> 01:01:15.720
I don't want to get hurt anymore than we need to.

01:01:15.720 --> 01:01:17.720
I heard that belief and I was going to go for it.

01:01:18.720 --> 01:01:20.720
I think we're about to get on her screen.

01:01:25.720 --> 01:01:27.720
Long story short, I missed.

01:01:27.720 --> 01:01:29.720
Yeah, I missed again.

01:01:29.720 --> 01:01:30.720
And then I shot.

01:01:30.720 --> 01:01:31.720
And then I shot.

01:01:31.720 --> 01:01:32.720
And then I missed again.

01:01:34.720 --> 01:01:35.720
Thumb arrived.

01:01:35.720 --> 01:01:36.720
Alright.

01:01:41.720 --> 01:01:43.720
Okay, we're about to climb.

01:01:43.720 --> 01:01:45.720
Climb, climb, climb, climb!

01:01:47.720 --> 01:01:50.720
Yeah, I think the campaign mode is roughly 7 hours.

01:01:50.720 --> 01:01:53.720
We could probably come back in 100% the sectors.

01:01:53.720 --> 01:01:56.720
And we can also play this mini-conquest game,

01:01:56.720 --> 01:01:58.720
which actually I really enjoyed as a kid.

01:01:58.720 --> 01:02:01.720
But you have to do it at the end of the game

01:02:01.720 --> 01:02:03.720
for like 100% success rate.

01:02:04.720 --> 01:02:07.720
There are Viper Wolves ahead,

01:02:07.720 --> 01:02:10.720
but we're just going to be cheeky and do this.

01:02:10.720 --> 01:02:12.720
And then we completely negate

01:02:12.720 --> 01:02:14.720
even having to fight a lot of them.

01:02:15.720 --> 01:02:20.720
Unfortunately, invisibility...

01:02:20.720 --> 01:02:25.720
No, invincibility is when they can't hurt you.

01:02:25.720 --> 01:02:28.720
Invisibility is when they can't sneeze.

01:02:29.720 --> 01:02:30.720
It doesn't last forever,

01:02:30.720 --> 01:02:32.720
but as we level up...

01:02:32.720 --> 01:02:33.720
Like...

01:02:33.720 --> 01:02:35.720
Oh, actually we're really close to leveling up.

01:02:35.720 --> 01:02:36.720
I don't know if I should...

01:02:36.720 --> 01:02:37.720
I don't want to hurt the wolves.

01:02:39.720 --> 01:02:40.720
I don't want to hurt the wolves,

01:02:40.720 --> 01:02:42.720
but I'll kill the humans, no problem.

01:02:42.720 --> 01:02:43.720
Yeah, no, that's fine.

01:02:43.720 --> 01:02:44.720
That's fine.

01:02:46.720 --> 01:02:47.720
Yeah, that thing, that thing.

01:02:47.720 --> 01:02:48.720
It's friendly fire on.

01:02:49.720 --> 01:02:51.720
No, you cannot hurt other navi

01:02:51.720 --> 01:02:52.720
now that you're a navi side.

01:02:52.720 --> 01:02:54.720
I assume it's the same if you pick RDA.

01:02:55.720 --> 01:02:56.720
Oh, good snipe.

01:02:58.720 --> 01:02:59.720
Oh, good snipe.

01:03:00.720 --> 01:03:03.720
Okay, if I can take my time to properly aim.

01:03:04.720 --> 01:03:06.720
No, I think I was out of range.

01:03:06.720 --> 01:03:08.720
There is a range to your attacks.

01:03:08.720 --> 01:03:09.720
Like, you can't...

01:03:09.720 --> 01:03:11.720
Oh, well, I just suck.

01:03:11.720 --> 01:03:12.720
There we go.

01:03:12.720 --> 01:03:15.720
There is a range distance to your attacks.

01:03:16.720 --> 01:03:17.720
I cannot for the life of the human.

01:03:17.720 --> 01:03:19.720
Am I to go this way?

01:03:21.720 --> 01:03:23.720
Am I to go this way?

01:03:23.720 --> 01:03:25.720
No, classic dead end.

01:03:25.720 --> 01:03:26.720
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

01:03:26.720 --> 01:03:27.720
Mom, get the camera.

01:03:27.720 --> 01:03:29.720
Play of the game, honestly.

01:03:29.720 --> 01:03:32.720
Did you guys see that Marvel Superhero,

01:03:32.720 --> 01:03:33.720
like 5v5?

01:03:35.720 --> 01:03:36.720
I hear a bomb.

01:03:37.720 --> 01:03:38.720
I see a bomb.

01:03:39.720 --> 01:03:40.720
Um, um, um, um, um, um,

01:03:40.720 --> 01:03:42.720
I really don't want the bomb to get me.

01:03:42.720 --> 01:03:43.720
Oh, I'm already out of in this.

01:03:44.720 --> 01:03:46.720
And the bomb is chasing me.

01:03:46.720 --> 01:03:47.720
Okay, we're doing it.

01:03:47.720 --> 01:03:48.720
We're just going for it.

01:03:48.720 --> 01:03:49.720
We're committing.

01:03:49.720 --> 01:03:50.720
Did anyone play it?

01:03:51.720 --> 01:03:52.720
Marvel rivals.

01:03:52.720 --> 01:03:53.720
Yeah.

01:03:53.720 --> 01:03:54.720
It looks so good.

01:03:55.720 --> 01:03:57.720
Everyone was, like, dogging on it,

01:03:57.720 --> 01:03:58.720
but I'm like,

01:03:58.720 --> 01:04:00.720
oh, I actually really enjoyed the look of it.

01:04:02.720 --> 01:04:03.720
Uh,

01:04:04.720 --> 01:04:06.720
I'm installing the game now

01:04:06.720 --> 01:04:07.720
just to kill the Navi.

01:04:07.720 --> 01:04:08.720
You know what?

01:04:08.720 --> 01:04:09.720
You're done.

01:04:10.720 --> 01:04:11.720
You're done.

01:04:12.720 --> 01:04:13.720
I'm definitely going to play

01:04:13.720 --> 01:04:14.720
Marvel Overwatch when it comes out.

01:04:14.720 --> 01:04:15.720
Yeah, and then wasn't there

01:04:15.720 --> 01:04:17.720
not another company

01:04:17.720 --> 01:04:18.720
that came out with another

01:04:18.720 --> 01:04:19.720
Overwatch-style game?

01:04:19.720 --> 01:04:20.720
I think it was Marvel.

01:04:20.720 --> 01:04:21.720
It was a company that came out

01:04:21.720 --> 01:04:23.720
with another Overwatch-style game.

01:04:23.720 --> 01:04:24.720
I think development teams

01:04:24.720 --> 01:04:26.720
literally watched, like,

01:04:26.720 --> 01:04:28.720
the mess up in real time.

01:04:28.720 --> 01:04:30.720
I don't know if that thing's still chasing me, but,

01:04:30.720 --> 01:04:31.720
um,

01:04:32.720 --> 01:04:33.720
there is another one.

01:04:34.720 --> 01:04:35.720
Yeah, like Scarlet Witch

01:04:35.720 --> 01:04:36.720
with Moira and all that.

01:04:36.720 --> 01:04:37.720
Yeah.

01:04:37.720 --> 01:04:38.720
I used to play a lot of Overwatch.

01:04:38.720 --> 01:04:39.720
I actually really enjoyed the game,

01:04:39.720 --> 01:04:41.720
but I just don't play it anymore.

01:04:41.720 --> 01:04:44.720
Like, I don't find it rewarding,

01:04:44.720 --> 01:04:45.720
or,

01:04:45.720 --> 01:04:46.720
which is such a shame,

01:04:46.720 --> 01:04:47.720
because I've poured

01:04:47.720 --> 01:04:49.720
a lot of hours into that game.

01:04:49.720 --> 01:04:50.720
Um,

01:04:51.720 --> 01:04:52.720
but I would absolutely love

01:04:52.720 --> 01:04:54.720
if we could do Marvel rivals together

01:04:54.720 --> 01:04:55.720
as, like, a stream snag game.

01:04:55.720 --> 01:04:57.720
Like, um,

01:04:57.720 --> 01:05:00.720
I don't know how the accounts work,

01:05:00.720 --> 01:05:02.720
but I'm, like, 99% sure

01:05:02.720 --> 01:05:03.720
I can make a dummy account,

01:05:03.720 --> 01:05:04.720
and then, like,

01:05:04.720 --> 01:05:06.720
add users' friends,

01:05:06.720 --> 01:05:09.720
and then make note of who's, like, played,

01:05:09.720 --> 01:05:10.720
and then just rotate between,

01:05:10.720 --> 01:05:11.720
like, kind of what we...

01:05:11.720 --> 01:05:12.720
Oh, here we go.

01:05:12.720 --> 01:05:13.720
Level up.

01:05:13.720 --> 01:05:14.720
What did I unlock?

01:05:14.720 --> 01:05:15.720
Let's see.

01:05:16.720 --> 01:05:18.720
Uh, Bam Knee Pack.

01:05:18.720 --> 01:05:21.720
We have a club weapon with frickin' spears on it,

01:05:21.720 --> 01:05:24.720
or another type of RDA gun.

01:05:24.720 --> 01:05:25.720
Oh.

01:05:25.720 --> 01:05:26.720
And a shot.

01:05:26.720 --> 01:05:27.720
And a missed.

01:05:27.720 --> 01:05:28.720
Oh, and a missed again.

01:05:29.720 --> 01:05:30.720
I can hear an enemy.

01:05:30.720 --> 01:05:31.720
I don't see him.

01:05:31.720 --> 01:05:32.720
Oh, there he is.

01:05:36.720 --> 01:05:38.720
That wasn't him that said that.

01:05:38.720 --> 01:05:39.720
Oh well.

01:05:39.720 --> 01:05:40.720
Whatever.

01:05:40.720 --> 01:05:41.720
Whatever.

01:05:41.720 --> 01:05:42.720
Um...

01:05:43.720 --> 01:05:45.720
Blizzard is horrible with their IPs yet.

01:05:45.720 --> 01:05:47.720
Time to go back to Team Fortress 2.

01:05:47.720 --> 01:05:48.720
Honestly?

01:05:48.720 --> 01:05:49.720
But I'm sh...

01:05:49.720 --> 01:05:52.720
I could have sworn I saw another development team

01:05:52.720 --> 01:05:54.720
come out with something that was similar

01:05:54.720 --> 01:05:55.720
out to the format as well.

01:05:55.720 --> 01:05:58.720
So I think, literally, everyone watched,

01:05:58.720 --> 01:05:59.720
uh, Overwatch 2 come out,

01:05:59.720 --> 01:06:03.720
and as soon as Jeff Kaplan left the development team,

01:06:03.720 --> 01:06:06.720
I think everyone behind the scenes

01:06:06.720 --> 01:06:08.720
knew what on Earth was up

01:06:08.720 --> 01:06:09.720
and knew it was, like,

01:06:09.720 --> 01:06:10.720
essentially gonna flop

01:06:10.720 --> 01:06:12.720
due to the, uh,

01:06:12.720 --> 01:06:14.720
change in...

01:06:14.720 --> 01:06:15.720
gameplay.

01:06:15.720 --> 01:06:18.720
But when Marvel Rivals does come out,

01:06:18.720 --> 01:06:19.720
uh,

01:06:19.720 --> 01:06:21.720
because I think it's in beta right now,

01:06:21.720 --> 01:06:22.720
or...

01:06:22.720 --> 01:06:23.720
I may be wrong,

01:06:23.720 --> 01:06:24.720
um,

01:06:24.720 --> 01:06:25.720
I'm happy to make a dummy account.

01:06:25.720 --> 01:06:26.720
We'll make it a multiplayer game,

01:06:26.720 --> 01:06:27.720
and, uh,

01:06:27.720 --> 01:06:29.720
we'll just kinda...

01:06:29.720 --> 01:06:30.720
uh,

01:06:30.720 --> 01:06:31.720
add in,

01:06:31.720 --> 01:06:32.720
uh,

01:06:32.720 --> 01:06:33.720
I think it's 5v5,

01:06:33.720 --> 01:06:34.720
so it means four reeflings of myself

01:06:34.720 --> 01:06:35.720
can play at the same time

01:06:35.720 --> 01:06:36.720
against, uh,

01:06:36.720 --> 01:06:37.720
just randomers.

01:06:37.720 --> 01:06:38.720
Um,

01:06:38.720 --> 01:06:39.720
we'll, like,

01:06:39.720 --> 01:06:40.720
play actual public match games,

01:06:40.720 --> 01:06:41.720
uh,

01:06:41.720 --> 01:06:42.720
unless you guys

01:06:42.720 --> 01:06:44.720
really wanted to go against each other.

01:06:44.720 --> 01:06:49.720
I'm not sure having me and your team

01:06:49.720 --> 01:06:50.720
will be a good idea though,

01:06:50.720 --> 01:06:51.720
cause I'm not very strong at the game

01:06:51.720 --> 01:06:52.720
cause I've yet to even play it.

01:06:52.720 --> 01:06:53.720
Um...

01:06:53.720 --> 01:06:54.720
But if that's something you guys

01:06:54.720 --> 01:06:55.720
are down for,

01:06:55.720 --> 01:06:56.720
I'm heking down for it as well,

01:06:56.720 --> 01:06:57.720
uh,

01:06:57.720 --> 01:06:58.720
obviously,

01:06:58.720 --> 01:06:59.720
uh,

01:06:59.720 --> 01:07:00.720
we'll

01:07:00.720 --> 01:07:01.720
remove everyone

01:07:01.720 --> 01:07:02.720
at the end of the gaming session

01:07:02.720 --> 01:07:03.720
and restart fresh.

01:07:03.720 --> 01:07:04.720
As I said,

01:07:04.720 --> 01:07:05.720
it'll be

01:07:05.720 --> 01:07:06.720
pow!

01:07:06.720 --> 01:07:07.720
I saw that,

01:07:07.720 --> 01:07:08.720
I don't know if I'm

01:07:08.720 --> 01:07:09.720
gonna get ahaaa!

01:07:09.720 --> 01:07:10.720
Right,

01:07:10.720 --> 01:07:11.720
I'm backing off,

01:07:11.720 --> 01:07:12.720
I'm backing off.

01:07:12.720 --> 01:07:13.720
I don't think

01:07:13.720 --> 01:07:24.960
down yet. No. That part comes later on. I didn't know. I'm gonna pick this up. Team

01:07:24.960 --> 01:07:31.240
Landers, Johnny. Oh, should I tell everyone what to do? Protect me, heal me, heal me.

01:07:31.240 --> 01:07:42.480
I used to play Zarya, which is an offensive tank. Over what? Oh my god, they're so beautiful.

01:07:42.480 --> 01:07:53.400
The music's changed. Oh, they're so beautiful. The ikran. Look at them all judging me. Oh,

01:07:53.400 --> 01:08:01.360
that's okay. You can judge me. Look at them. They're so pretty. Hello. Please don't attack

01:08:01.360 --> 01:08:11.080
me. They're so beautiful. Oh, oh, oh, oh. Please understand. This game's a little old, which

01:08:11.080 --> 01:08:16.240
is why they're all the same color. Please forgive. Please forgive. But I assume the new avatar is

01:08:16.240 --> 01:08:22.960
like really beautiful. And my ikran literally almost made me perish and then said, yeah,

01:08:22.960 --> 01:08:27.880
all right, I'll pick you up. I got pranked by it. I literally done a little pranky on me.

01:08:27.880 --> 01:08:38.920
A little pranky-wanky. Oh. No. No. It's not a good look, honestly. I mean, you would really choose

01:08:39.160 --> 01:08:48.680
match over Mecha over the big birdie. Exactly. Why would you pick? Oh, look at us. We're so

01:08:48.680 --> 01:09:04.040
lying. There's no an RDA that will leave alive because the resource destroying the Pandora.

01:09:08.040 --> 01:09:13.480
Oh, I love fly. Oh, ow, ow. Sorry, your wing, your wing. My apologies. Sorry.

01:09:14.200 --> 01:09:21.400
I didn't mean to hurt your wing, little Banshee, but thank you for being so forgiving.

01:09:22.200 --> 01:09:28.600
But we're just flying through the map now. Banshees have an insane HP. We will be shot at as we go

01:09:28.600 --> 01:09:37.000
around. I don't know if you read that really quickly. It said lifting the fog 50%. Don't worry.

01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:41.800
Oh, we really need to get some height. Oh, I'm going to do a little cheeky 360 to get that

01:09:41.800 --> 01:09:49.320
height there. We are about to reach the ceiling in this game. Oh, all right. Climb. Climb. Jeez,

01:09:49.320 --> 01:09:54.680
this map has a lot of verticality. Definitely did not remember that. But yes, there was a

01:09:54.680 --> 01:10:00.120
sector challenge that says lifting the fog. There's a few sector challenges. Depending on how long

01:10:00.120 --> 01:10:08.840
the campaign takes, we might actually just 100% all the sections. Oh, excuse me, game.

01:10:09.800 --> 01:10:19.160
I know for a fact I flew over that. Would you like to register me flying through this?

01:10:19.960 --> 01:10:25.960
No. Oh, okay. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Women moment. All right. Hold on. Hold on. Lady drive.

01:10:25.960 --> 01:10:31.320
Okay, there we go. There we go. You got it in the end. I'm sure this is like really beautiful

01:10:31.320 --> 01:10:36.440
cinematic if you do. Oh, we got it. Okay, but we're hitting that rock. Sorry. Sorry. Sorry. Look,

01:10:36.440 --> 01:10:41.560
the camera angle isn't, it's not that easy to freaking dive, dive. All right, then go up,

01:10:41.560 --> 01:10:49.080
go up, go up. Hey, there we go. But yes, Banshee are a really good way to get around these maps.

01:10:49.800 --> 01:10:56.600
Whoa, easy, easy, easy. And we are back to the start where we started. Look at us going.

01:10:57.480 --> 01:11:02.680
Isn't that beautiful? Okay, I am going to say before we start this next quest,

01:11:03.080 --> 01:11:08.600
there is a voice line that repeats consistently through this mission. I will try to get through

01:11:08.600 --> 01:11:15.400
it as fast as possible. It is so annoying. It is so annoying. Genuinely so annoying,

01:11:15.400 --> 01:11:20.040
horrifically annoying. Unless this isn't the mission.

01:11:25.560 --> 01:11:26.600
Don't say that.

01:11:33.160 --> 01:11:36.360
Maybe this isn't the mission I thought it was.

01:11:39.480 --> 01:11:46.280
And where are the turkeys? Audio bugs are the worst. Is that Ubisoft game? It has to be.

01:11:48.280 --> 01:11:53.160
The, the animals slowly regretting letting you drive them, honestly. Okay, no, it's after this

01:11:53.160 --> 01:12:00.120
mission. They're really annoying when pops up. What did we unlock? A crossbow and some sort of

01:12:00.120 --> 01:12:10.760
ability. Hold on. How do I open that? Skills? Kinetic dash, Ewa's breath, Titan bash I don't

01:12:10.760 --> 01:12:17.240
really use. We could maybe replace it with, Calls of Hyperwolf to your side. It'll fight for you

01:12:17.240 --> 01:12:23.800
for a short time. That's pretty cool. Honestly, bees, death by bees. Right, here we go. What the

01:12:23.800 --> 01:12:28.920
heck am I supposed to do? I completely forgot. Right, we're going to raid or a crane. Can I go on you?

01:12:30.920 --> 01:12:35.080
Okay, look. Oh, he's going forward. I never really,

01:12:35.080 --> 01:12:40.360
Hey, Ostrone, I'm off to work. But if the stream ends up being a bit longer,

01:12:40.360 --> 01:12:44.440
then I should be back in time. See you after work. Hope to catch you there.

01:12:45.160 --> 01:12:51.640
Thank you, tiny spiny. I appreciate the tip. And yes, um, I did look it up. I said the game

01:12:51.640 --> 01:12:56.120
takes around seven hours to complete. If we come back and do section stuff that wait,

01:12:56.280 --> 01:13:01.560
that where am I? That land? I think I'll land up here. Yeah. Okay. It looks like I'm definitely

01:13:01.560 --> 01:13:08.600
to land to keep that crane safe up here. You stay there, buddy. You be nice and safe. But

01:13:08.600 --> 01:13:11.960
yes, have a good day at work. Thanks for hanging. I appreciate it. And I appreciate the tip too.

01:13:14.040 --> 01:13:16.760
I'm not to say donations because it's not a donation. It's a tip.

01:13:17.880 --> 01:13:22.040
Actually, I don't know if I'm supposed to update the girls as things to be like,

01:13:22.760 --> 01:13:26.760
you know how you're supposed to put like a disclaimer on like the freaking thing in case

01:13:26.760 --> 01:13:36.680
someone does a charge back. Right. I'm 99% sure these guys just keep respawning. So I'm actually

01:13:36.680 --> 01:13:45.560
not to fuss. Do you mind? Thank you. I'm not to fuss for completely clearing up the section.

01:13:45.720 --> 01:13:57.560
Oh, it's a bomb. It's a bomb. Okay, there we go. Let's go up. Is that about to like blow up right

01:13:57.560 --> 01:14:03.800
next to me? Oh, I didn't. Oh, no, we didn't kill guys don't look at explosions. You know the drill.

01:14:03.800 --> 01:14:08.040
Okay. You know the drill. Kill guys don't look at explosion. Well, you mean stream,

01:14:08.040 --> 01:14:14.760
elements is intact. I like some if someone does like a thing, a disclaimer for charge right would

01:14:14.760 --> 01:14:20.520
be I'll probably edit the motor then or when I get off. I don't know. I get tired. I get tired

01:14:20.520 --> 01:14:29.000
after screaming. Okay. Oh, I have a fantastic update for scripts. Oh my goodness. So the script

01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:38.360
manager now has access and is taking over and look. So everyone has a four part series coming out

01:14:38.360 --> 01:14:46.200
like a story that kind of progresses. Sheeby's four part series is currently being written right

01:14:46.200 --> 01:14:52.760
now. I'm not trying to say anything, but good luck trying to hold it together when she performs that

01:14:52.760 --> 01:15:00.840
script. Because wow, I was blown away. I'm like, there's definitely like something to be said about

01:15:00.840 --> 01:15:06.760
like a guy writing a script versus like what I could write because I just like I like challenging

01:15:06.760 --> 01:15:13.320
myself and in general like I know what overall you'd like us to say type thing. But I have to

01:15:13.320 --> 01:15:20.200
admit I was like, oh my god, there's not going to be any anything left in the sack after that one.

01:15:20.200 --> 01:15:26.680
And that was part one I read. I didn't even read the finalized series of it. And Azur's one is being

01:15:26.680 --> 01:15:35.560
worked on next. Oh my god. Sorry. I didn't I wasn't paying attention to like how many bad guys are

01:15:35.560 --> 01:15:40.280
there? Right, we're going to watch the explosion this time because we can. What's the explosion look like?

01:15:41.720 --> 01:15:45.080
Okay, it was just kind of out of control. Oh no, the tower does go down. Okay, I like it.

01:15:45.800 --> 01:15:51.880
I wonder if we can get some XP for destroying this. Ow. Okay, we can get XP for doing that.

01:15:52.920 --> 01:16:01.560
I think, why didn't? Azur's story, I don't I don't know if I should ruin what the story is. Like,

01:16:01.560 --> 01:16:05.560
I don't want to like tell stuff that's kind of like exciting for the girls.

01:16:07.880 --> 01:16:14.440
But like, I like the four part series ideas, like Emmys one I really like. No, don't spoil it. Okay,

01:16:14.440 --> 01:16:19.160
I won't spoil it. Um, oh, there's a home tree right there. Actually, I don't know if I should grab it

01:16:19.160 --> 01:16:24.280
the now. Actually, no, I have access to the Ikaran to fly around the map. So it's not going to be that

01:16:25.160 --> 01:16:33.480
a deal of us coming back. Newbie would begin a work is a lot. Yes, I like so now that like the

01:16:33.480 --> 01:16:40.040
scripts are no longer my problem, I get to focus on making the girl short. So Mercy came out with

01:16:40.040 --> 01:16:44.600
a short and she was like, do you do you think I should have been blonde Senpai and showed like

01:16:44.600 --> 01:16:49.800
behind the scenes artwork? I'm going to get everyone to do that to show their concept art like me as

01:16:49.880 --> 01:16:54.840
well. Actually, I need to write the scripts. And like, I get to work on that kind of fun stuff

01:16:54.840 --> 01:17:03.400
instead of kind of like being stretched too far. Like, it's too easy. It's too easy. I'm not even

01:17:03.400 --> 01:17:10.120
going to say it's that easy. Um, you can go as well because you were shooting my crime. You're

01:17:10.120 --> 01:17:17.160
not supposed to shoot my crime. Um, literally, spoiler channel is always looking for literally,

01:17:17.400 --> 01:17:23.240
uh, just I get so excited about everything that's planned behind the scenes that I'm like, oh,

01:17:23.240 --> 01:17:28.040
I don't want to ruin it for the girls. Oh, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow,

01:17:28.040 --> 01:17:32.520
here, here, here, here, sorry, sorry. I'm too busy rambling. I'm not even actually focusing on the

01:17:32.520 --> 01:17:42.040
dang game play. Wait, oh no, we don't want shot them anymore. They've gotten too strong now. That's

01:17:42.040 --> 01:17:53.000
the problem. If you don't like, um, farm XP, you will fall behind. Concept art was great to

01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:57.160
see. Yeah, so I get to like kind of do that fun behind the scenes script stuff like the shorts

01:17:57.160 --> 01:18:09.240
for the girls. Um, um, also super gracious thank you to everyone who is using YouTube clip feature

01:18:09.240 --> 01:18:16.280
for the girls. Um, if you didn't know, if I go on their stream, I can see who and what has been

01:18:16.280 --> 01:18:22.200
clipped. I just want to say, uh, there's actually quite a few people who are clipping my burps at

01:18:22.200 --> 01:18:27.480
the moment. I might unironically make a 15 minute burp compilation just for the heck of it and call

01:18:27.480 --> 01:18:33.800
it like scrawny burps for 14 minutes and 53 seconds. Uh, and just for the heck of it because

01:18:33.800 --> 01:18:40.120
it seems to be something, uh, a few, uh, gentlemen seem to enjoy and you know, I'm not here to ruin

01:18:40.120 --> 01:18:46.360
anyone's day. Uh, but yes, please do consider clipping. We have a really funny, uh, short of

01:18:46.360 --> 01:18:53.720
icy coming soon. Um, our second clipper, we're kind of testing them out. I don't have a problem

01:18:53.720 --> 01:18:58.040
because I've already actually got extensive clip history, but they're busy at the moment. So the

01:18:58.040 --> 01:19:02.360
clips are a wee bit slow to be produced. We're getting there. We're getting there. So thank you

01:19:02.360 --> 01:19:07.800
to anyone who uses a YouTube clip feature. Does help out any highlight moments? A short of icy

01:19:07.800 --> 01:19:14.680
doing what? So it's already happened. So it's not a spoiler, but AC basically when,

01:19:15.640 --> 01:19:23.160
in her adorable voice, like, I'm not very smart. And then she went, thank you so much, Mike, honey,

01:19:23.160 --> 01:19:28.520
for donating to me and her adorable freaking accent. And I'm like, AC,

01:19:29.480 --> 01:19:34.920
ACICAL. Should I have taught you that? Should I have said to you what that means?

01:19:37.480 --> 01:19:40.920
So we're going to, we're going to get turned into a clip, not really sure on her thing.

01:19:42.360 --> 01:19:47.000
But her accent is so freaking adorable. Okay, I'm going to bed. Rest well. See you in the morning

01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:51.880
when you wake up, sweet dreams. I love seeing that. I love seeing that. Whenever you guys are like,

01:19:51.880 --> 01:19:55.000
okay, I need to go to work or I need to go to sleep. I'm like, yeah, see you in the morning. See you

01:19:55.000 --> 01:19:58.680
in the morning. Oh yeah, work or I'll see you after work. Yeah, yeah. Oh, you didn't go out

01:19:58.680 --> 01:20:04.840
do some errands. I'll see you after that. I'll still be on. Right. This is the scene. The quote is,

01:20:04.840 --> 01:20:11.320
Raider, you have got to get to higher ground. It will be repeated a ridiculous amount of times.

01:20:12.280 --> 01:20:17.320
Yep. I remember the quote. I've not even played this game in many a year. Raider, you've got to

01:20:17.320 --> 01:20:23.160
get to higher grounds. It will repeat. And I'm like, did no one play test this? Did no one see what

01:20:23.160 --> 01:20:29.800
an issue this is? Because I've gone the wrong way. I've gone the wrong way. Oh, and I've hurt

01:20:29.800 --> 01:20:38.120
myself. Let's hurry this up. Who's this section? Oh my God, imagine that coming at you. I would

01:20:38.120 --> 01:20:45.400
actually be so terrified. Shawnee, you've got to get to higher ground. Honestly. Get that done.

01:20:46.280 --> 01:20:51.240
Get that done. Right. We destroy one way.

01:20:53.240 --> 01:20:57.720
Oh, I love it. Love it. Special. What's right? Oh, no. What's my special?

01:21:03.160 --> 01:21:07.400
I don't know what button the special is, though. Yes, we spawn at checkpoint.

01:21:07.400 --> 01:21:11.000
It's putting, it's giving me keyboard input, but I'm playing mouse and controller. Like,

01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:14.600
I don't know if you can hear my analog stick. Right. Let's do that. Another try.

01:21:15.320 --> 01:21:21.160
That was a bit daft. I do apologize for that MLG game. I'm going the wrong way again.

01:21:24.120 --> 01:21:30.920
I can't all be good at video games. Literally, wherever nine year old me is inside my head right

01:21:30.920 --> 01:21:36.520
now, can you like come and like help us out here? Because this is getting very good. It's getting

01:21:36.520 --> 01:21:43.240
embarrassing. Right. I'm going to click the analog sticks this time to see if that's what the special

01:21:43.320 --> 01:21:50.280
is instead. Right. Special analog. Nope. That's, uh, nope. That's scan.

01:21:51.720 --> 01:21:56.600
What would R, what would R be? Am I literally, you know what? I'm just going to hit R and my

01:21:56.600 --> 01:22:03.000
keyboard. Are you squinting me right now? Oh, Stronny, you've got to get to higher ground.

01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:07.320
No, Anna, don't throw me. It's so, wait, why is this not breaking?

01:22:08.040 --> 01:22:15.560
Is there a health bar? Oh, there is. Oh, is it glitched out? I can see that health bar,

01:22:15.560 --> 01:22:23.800
that little green. What's going on? Thank you for the tip, Anna. Wait, I think it's glitched out.

01:22:24.600 --> 01:22:30.200
This is an old game. Hold on. Let me do this. I'll do it with a bigger one.

01:22:30.600 --> 01:22:42.200
Uh, game. Game, you're showing your time. I've never actually had it glitched out here before.

01:22:49.480 --> 01:22:55.240
Right. I had to press F on the keyboard. I don't know what button I was supposed to press on the

01:22:55.240 --> 01:23:01.320
freaking, I'm, I would, oh, I keep saying it. Literally, where do you've got to get to higher

01:23:01.320 --> 01:23:10.840
ground? I literally F in the chat. That's, oh, oh, oh, you're getting whacked, mate. Oh, then you fall

01:23:10.840 --> 01:23:18.840
now. Oh, he's hiding in the freaking bushes. Right, healing up, healing up, healing up. Don't

01:23:18.840 --> 01:23:25.320
worry, don't worry. Uh, actually, I think these are much faster. Yeah, these are one shot. The

01:23:25.320 --> 01:23:32.360
dual wield is one shot, but the long stick isn't one shot. Hmm, what does that mean?

01:23:34.280 --> 01:23:37.480
Right, okay, we're just going to press the keyboard. We're literally just switching

01:23:37.480 --> 01:23:40.280
between the keyboard and the ticket thing. I don't know what I'm supposed to press.

01:23:40.920 --> 01:23:48.200
Get whacked for free, must be nice. Is that the honor you should be watching by any chance?

01:23:49.560 --> 01:23:55.960
Hmm. Uh, right down we go. I don't know. Are you squiddin' me right now?

01:23:57.480 --> 01:23:59.960
Virginia! Have you considered getting to higher ground?

01:23:59.960 --> 01:24:05.880
Stop! No, I'm getting trolled! Thank you for the tip, for so. He repeats it so much,

01:24:05.880 --> 01:24:11.960
but he's not doing it right now. I wonder, because I don't know why he's not repeating it,

01:24:12.680 --> 01:24:18.840
but I kid you not, he constantly repeats, you have got to get to higher, you have got to get to

01:24:18.840 --> 01:24:26.600
higher ground. Over and over and over and over. But, uh, I think we're actually being given,

01:24:27.400 --> 01:24:35.560
oh, objective. The classic three and done in video games. If Aintbroke don't fix it,

01:24:35.560 --> 01:24:42.280
do this thing three times and you win. Delicious. Delicious, delicious, delicious.

01:24:43.880 --> 01:24:52.600
Love it. I love it when game devs get the memory. Oh my god, I'm inside that! I'm inside it! Leave

01:24:52.600 --> 01:25:03.240
alone! No! Oh no, I'm a... Oh, that's not good. I'm having a seizure.

01:25:08.440 --> 01:25:16.360
Home tree! Oh, wait a minute. I think I might have died and now I'm at home tree and I'm about to be

01:25:16.360 --> 01:25:21.720
spiritually be a navi. Like, yeah, spiritually. I'm like physically about to be like 100%

01:25:21.720 --> 01:25:33.400
navi if I remember correctly. Oh yeah, that's right. Oh, I can feel myself connecting with nature.

01:25:34.120 --> 01:25:38.440
Oh, I should...

01:25:51.560 --> 01:25:52.840
Are you with me right now?

01:25:53.480 --> 01:25:54.280
Wah!

01:25:58.680 --> 01:26:04.200
Heck yeah, speak for the trees. Thank you, Tim Shotol. For the tip. I can never say that

01:26:04.200 --> 01:26:06.280
name right. Shotol. Ah!

01:26:11.560 --> 01:26:18.120
Eh, AWA just resurrected me and AWA's word is truth, so I will not be taking any contesting

01:26:18.120 --> 01:26:19.960
points that I'm no a navi anymore.

01:26:23.560 --> 01:26:29.640
Actually, I really enjoyed the second Avatar movie because what's her name? The one that

01:26:30.440 --> 01:26:34.120
is Sigourney Weaver as a child? I really like her plot line.

01:26:37.880 --> 01:26:42.280
Eh, that she's like, can commune with AWA? I really like her.

01:26:46.200 --> 01:26:49.240
Avatar Stoney has an arrow under her hair!

01:26:53.800 --> 01:26:57.640
There's a second Avatar movie? Yeah, it's called Way of the Water.

01:26:59.320 --> 01:27:02.040
Did you not get advertised on anything?

01:27:04.200 --> 01:27:10.440
There's a second Avatar movie. It's out right now. I may have just spoiled it for you. I apologize.

01:27:13.320 --> 01:27:16.360
If I was home tree, I would tell Stoney to...

01:27:17.080 --> 01:27:23.560
If I was the home tree, I would tell Stoney to... I don't know what he want.

01:27:24.200 --> 01:27:28.120
What are you on about? What are you on about?

01:27:28.680 --> 01:27:34.520
This is a spiritual location. You can't loot the home tree.

01:27:35.480 --> 01:27:40.120
Okay, I say that as if there isn't a Gen 2 concept right now that may or may not have

01:27:41.080 --> 01:27:42.600
have some nun influence.

01:27:45.640 --> 01:27:50.600
You cannot do any activated mission things. Oh, it's the guy!

01:27:53.080 --> 01:27:54.920
Nothing but more than pure digging.

01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:00.280
My new abandoned name.

01:28:02.520 --> 01:28:05.560
Advertising for the second movie was a booze ball.

01:28:06.520 --> 01:28:10.200
It still did really well, did it not, if I'm not mistaken?

01:28:11.480 --> 01:28:14.120
Are you underestimating the power?

01:28:18.200 --> 01:28:22.440
You acting like the tree? Well, it's the Holy Spirit of Navi.

01:28:23.800 --> 01:28:30.600
Okay, we are going to Swatulu. Anyone else visited Swatulu?

01:28:30.600 --> 01:28:33.080
Maybe on spring break you went to Swatulu?

01:28:33.720 --> 01:28:35.800
Yeah, they are absolutely wrecking this place.

01:28:38.360 --> 01:28:42.680
This is not... This area is definitely getting absolutely wrecked.

01:28:45.240 --> 01:28:48.680
I just remembered what happens in this area. I'm like Nightmare Potenture.

01:28:52.840 --> 01:28:55.480
Very good location because something very cool happens.

01:28:55.800 --> 01:28:57.640
We aren't searching for the dormant site.

01:29:02.680 --> 01:29:04.920
No, actually, I think it's a later level, you know that?

01:29:07.160 --> 01:29:07.880
Anyway, it's cool.

01:29:09.480 --> 01:29:13.000
The first movie itself was already advertised enough for the second.

01:29:13.000 --> 01:29:14.600
That's probably what they said.

01:29:14.760 --> 01:29:28.440
That was really outrageous writer, I'm going to be honest.

01:29:28.440 --> 01:29:33.640
Saying no hablo to a Navi. I don't know, that felt a bit weird to me.

01:29:33.640 --> 01:29:35.080
I don't think we should let that one slide.

01:29:35.880 --> 01:29:39.240
That was... That was motivated. That was motivated.

01:29:39.960 --> 01:29:40.840
That was bizarre.

01:29:41.800 --> 01:29:46.280
And if you're literally fully Navi, you're not going to put effort into speaking Navi?

01:29:47.080 --> 01:29:50.360
We're going to unlock the home vision tree. What the heck is that?

01:29:53.080 --> 01:29:56.040
Oh, it's a tree of vision. Oh, it's a sector challenge.

01:29:58.200 --> 01:30:01.240
Am I crazy or was there a horse I could ride back here?

01:30:03.320 --> 01:30:08.360
Thank you, child, me for remembering. Oh my god, I'm actually so smart.

01:30:08.440 --> 01:30:11.480
What are you? You're just menacingly guarding this horse.

01:30:11.480 --> 01:30:13.400
Can I just take it? Thanks mate, appreciate it.

01:30:29.800 --> 01:30:34.920
There are RDAs, but the beautiful thing about these parts of the map,

01:30:35.480 --> 01:30:38.760
you can ignore it. You can just zoom ahead.

01:30:39.400 --> 01:30:42.840
This is one of those games where if you want to take your time and explore it,

01:30:42.840 --> 01:30:45.880
you most certainly can. But if you just want to be like,

01:30:45.880 --> 01:30:49.720
right, I want to do the objective. I don't want to leave the horse in the middle of here.

01:30:49.720 --> 01:30:53.240
What am I doing here? Oh no, I don't want my horse to...

01:30:53.240 --> 01:30:55.960
Wait, investigate. Oh, I'm only to do a drive-by?

01:30:55.960 --> 01:30:58.440
Oh, I can do a drive-by shooting all right. Don't mind me.

01:30:59.240 --> 01:30:59.880
Oh, let's go.

01:31:03.480 --> 01:31:06.200
Right, I don't think you can shoot well on horseback.

01:31:06.200 --> 01:31:08.760
Sorry, dire horse. It's called dire horse.

01:31:09.800 --> 01:31:11.560
But yes, I don't mind doing a drive-by.

01:31:13.480 --> 01:31:16.360
Right, left or right? Both are terrible.

01:31:17.240 --> 01:31:21.320
This one's a dead end, so do the dead end first and then come back for the open one

01:31:21.320 --> 01:31:25.880
because it's likely that the open will be like the next progression.

01:31:26.840 --> 01:31:29.880
Oh, my wee horse is getting injured.

01:31:31.320 --> 01:31:34.920
Shattered village. Yeah, looks absolutely desolate.

01:31:35.800 --> 01:31:40.600
Okay, I think the game's putting horses around the map in case we do end up losing.

01:31:40.600 --> 01:31:42.520
Can you put like samples on horseback? You cannot.

01:31:43.480 --> 01:31:50.040
Flex and then roll in arse. What do you mean you cannot roll your arse?

01:31:50.040 --> 01:31:53.960
Can you not iterate what you wish to rock on?

01:31:54.920 --> 01:31:57.720
I'll just start shoving ours and words that don't even have it.

01:31:57.720 --> 01:32:00.760
Oh, my poor horse. Oh, it's a mech. It's a mech. It's a mech.

01:32:00.760 --> 01:32:03.160
It's a mech. Oh, the horse is going to perish.

01:32:03.160 --> 01:32:06.040
Oh, no, the horse is perishing this game. I don't like it here.

01:32:07.080 --> 01:32:08.200
Let's get out of this place.

01:32:12.120 --> 01:32:15.880
Is this the first game? It is. This is not the new game that came out.

01:32:15.880 --> 01:32:19.640
This is the Archaic 2009 game.

01:32:20.360 --> 01:32:25.400
Loongeree is not here. Where is Loongeree?

01:32:26.440 --> 01:32:30.360
Loongeree, where are you, mate? I need to find Loongeree.

01:32:34.040 --> 01:32:38.920
Any Loongeree fans? I'm a Loongeree fan. Oh, the horse is getting in.

01:32:39.560 --> 01:32:40.680
Loongeree's gone to stop them.

01:32:44.920 --> 01:32:47.400
With Unipee. That's right, Riflin.

01:32:51.800 --> 01:32:53.000
Oh, Unipee's a person.

01:32:54.840 --> 01:33:00.280
Oh, what did we unlock? Let's see. The Onatopak.

01:33:02.440 --> 01:33:05.080
What is that? That looks like shards from the sky.

01:33:05.960 --> 01:33:08.840
That looked cool. I've not actually summoned a horse.

01:33:08.840 --> 01:33:12.600
What was that? Birds from the sky? Column Pandora to help strike.

01:33:13.960 --> 01:33:16.360
Oh, my God. Hold on. What does it look like?

01:33:20.200 --> 01:33:24.120
Oh, okay. Okay. Okay. Little baby. Little baby clangs.

01:33:25.160 --> 01:33:28.040
Okay. Great. We can go through here.

01:33:28.760 --> 01:33:35.400
Oh, I'm getting shot at. Or is he shooting at an NPC? I don't know.

01:33:35.400 --> 01:33:36.840
Hello. Do you need assistance?

01:33:41.560 --> 01:33:45.400
She just expired. I don't know. I don't even speak Navi.

01:33:45.400 --> 01:33:48.280
I don't even know what her last words were. Oh, my God.

01:33:48.280 --> 01:33:50.600
Her family's going to be like, what were her last words?

01:33:50.600 --> 01:33:53.880
And I'm like, I'm so sorry, mate. I'm actually a skypey poll.

01:33:54.520 --> 01:33:57.960
You're going to have to forgive me, but is there an enemy there?

01:33:59.240 --> 01:34:04.840
No, that's a boss. Where's the enemy? That's actually really embarrassing.

01:34:06.200 --> 01:34:08.920
Yeah, we don't know her last words because I'm a dumb dumb.

01:34:08.920 --> 01:34:12.600
We're playing that. Hello. Are you okay? Are you squiddin' me right now?

01:34:12.600 --> 01:34:16.520
Brian! I really like the second Avatar movie,

01:34:16.520 --> 01:34:21.000
especially the scene where they destroy almost everything that was achieved in the first

01:34:21.960 --> 01:34:22.520
True.

01:34:24.840 --> 01:34:31.400
Okay, Iron Reaper, thank you for the tip. I'll admit, true. However, I present to you

01:34:32.120 --> 01:34:37.480
Sigourney Weaver's second storyline, and that's fine with me.

01:34:37.480 --> 01:34:40.360
I like that she's connected to Pandora, can control Pandora.

01:34:40.360 --> 01:34:43.560
Okay, to Awa, and Awa grants her those abilities.

01:34:43.960 --> 01:34:50.920
I don't think she's doing well. Are you going to expire after we finish talking?

01:34:50.920 --> 01:34:59.880
Because I can't translate your last words to tell your to tell your family.

01:35:04.200 --> 01:35:09.560
Oh, um, maybe you should expire because that's actually really great.

01:35:10.520 --> 01:35:13.480
That's really rude. Please don't do that.

01:35:25.320 --> 01:35:34.760
I need to claim. Please perish. Oh, my bow and arrow is not strong anymore whatsoever.

01:35:34.760 --> 01:35:39.800
I used to one shot these guys. It's now costing two ammo.

01:35:45.000 --> 01:35:49.800
Right, so what we have to do is just climb up these and then jump aboard when it comes

01:35:49.800 --> 01:35:58.600
background, and then we destroy its receiving signal thing, which completely, um, okay, yeah.

01:35:59.160 --> 01:36:03.080
Do you remember when we played Elden Ring and there is that chariot thing and you had to

01:36:03.080 --> 01:36:11.640
drop down on top of it? Basically that. We just need to slowly wait for it to turn.

01:36:11.640 --> 01:36:18.680
Yep, okay. And then when we get close enough, we just jump down.

01:36:21.800 --> 01:36:25.560
Wait, can I not just, can I not shoot that with bow and arrow?

01:36:27.400 --> 01:36:31.720
I feel like with their height difference, I could probably bow and arrow that.

01:36:33.800 --> 01:36:35.400
Uh-huh.

01:36:37.400 --> 01:36:40.600
Nope. Can't believe Elden Ring stole that idea literally.

01:36:44.600 --> 01:36:49.720
Uh, right. I think that's just showing, I need to go up on this one.

01:36:49.720 --> 01:36:53.080
What do you go up on this one? I can see it on the mini map that I'm covering up with my big

01:36:53.080 --> 01:36:56.280
hair, but the mini map, I wish I could put the mini map in the other corner.

01:36:57.640 --> 01:36:59.640
I'm always covering up the mini map when I play games.

01:36:59.800 --> 01:37:05.480
Uh-huh. Hopefully doesn't bother you guys. I assume it's coming around this corner very slowly.

01:37:06.600 --> 01:37:07.720
Something's trying to shoot up.

01:37:11.160 --> 01:37:13.480
Are you coming? Hello?

01:37:16.280 --> 01:37:21.240
Is it stuck? Am I out of its distance to move? Right, you, I can hear you shooting.

01:37:22.280 --> 01:37:28.840
Knock it off. Stop moving. Oh look, the picture plant. Look, it's sending flies out to hurt him.

01:37:29.480 --> 01:37:34.440
Death by flies. Death by flies. Oh, he's in. Did he come? I didn't know they could use,

01:37:34.440 --> 01:37:38.040
no, come back. You need to perish by flies or by bow and arrow. Pick.

01:37:41.000 --> 01:37:49.000
Fane. Okay, I'm out of the distance. Right, is this not, is it stuck? Why would it be stuck?

01:37:51.560 --> 01:37:54.040
Oh, fane. I think we're maybe too early.

01:37:55.480 --> 01:37:58.040
Watch it start moving when I come around this corner.

01:37:59.640 --> 01:38:05.960
Yeah, I was kind of joking. I was actually joking, but I seriously did it. I knew that.

01:38:05.960 --> 01:38:08.200
Where's the freaking bane? Where's the bane?

01:38:20.120 --> 01:38:22.760
Moving again because I'm out of your render distance.

01:38:22.760 --> 01:38:30.280
I am being pranked. I am being pranked. Wait, did it move?

01:38:32.760 --> 01:38:38.840
Wait, that is it there. That's it right there. The render distance is broke.

01:38:40.680 --> 01:38:47.160
Bro, it's going to start moving. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Let me get up the dang thing.

01:38:47.320 --> 01:38:56.520
Oh, that's literally the only song I know off by heart. It's actually really sad.

01:38:57.960 --> 01:39:06.040
There is an anime called Avatar the Last Airbender and Uncle Iroh is an absolute beloved character

01:39:06.040 --> 01:39:12.760
and he sang a really moving song. It's literally the only song I know off the top of my head.

01:39:13.720 --> 01:39:18.440
But it's like beautiful sad, not like hopefully not too sad sad, you know?

01:39:21.320 --> 01:39:26.600
I need to not bring that song up anywhere close to making here. We can not allow it to spoiler.

01:39:26.600 --> 01:39:32.200
Has Emi not seen it? Please stop it. I'm going to cry. Okay, okay, okay. We pause. We pause.

01:39:33.400 --> 01:39:40.520
I didn't realize there were bad guys here. Take this and this. Why am I taking so much damage?

01:39:40.600 --> 01:39:45.000
I don't know. Have I unlocked a new outfit? No, I haven't.

01:39:46.120 --> 01:39:50.840
Wait, do you see that stat increase though? So as we unlock new outfits, it's going to go up so much.

01:39:52.040 --> 01:39:56.440
You mean you don't? I don't know Secret Tunnel off by heart. Secret Tunnel. What am I supposed to do?

01:39:58.840 --> 01:40:02.120
I'm supposed to do something. Hold on. Ah, I see the blossoms.

01:40:02.120 --> 01:40:14.840
Two lovers forbidden from one another. There's a mountain in the way.

01:40:24.040 --> 01:40:26.360
And I kind of forget how this next part goes.

01:40:27.320 --> 01:40:30.280
Secret Tunnel. Brian, I'm singing.

01:40:34.280 --> 01:40:40.120
Emi's planning on doing it. So she's definitely support emu's when she does that. Definitely.

01:40:40.920 --> 01:40:42.120
Thank you for the tip, Nero.

01:40:49.080 --> 01:40:54.760
I kind of forgot how this next part goes. Can you guys put the lyrics in chat and then I'll like

01:40:54.760 --> 01:41:00.040
sing it to you guys. Shawnee, why have all the Scottish people met? Also nice.

01:41:01.800 --> 01:41:05.720
Why are Scottish people nice? Oh, we're just, we're just vibing.

01:41:05.720 --> 01:41:11.240
Scotland, Glasgow's been rated one of the nicest. Oh, we've got level up. We've got level up in our

01:41:11.240 --> 01:41:18.440
healing and our sprint. So are we like even faster? Oh, wow. Okay. Okay. That was a pretty

01:41:18.440 --> 01:41:23.640
decent distance. Are you actually a blue guy in this game or are you a skin walker like the movie?

01:41:24.120 --> 01:41:31.560
We have, our human body has died. It got annihilated via missiles. So yeah,

01:41:31.560 --> 01:41:37.400
we're like, we're Navi now. We're just trying to get accepted by the Navi and to reverse the

01:41:37.400 --> 01:41:49.720
horrific effects that I'm actually not very skilled at this bit. Oh, jeez, Louise. Oh my god,

01:41:49.720 --> 01:41:54.440
they like ate my health up so quickly. So this is what I mean by you get a second chance.

01:41:55.320 --> 01:42:04.200
I now have four second chances. Oh my goodness. Get right. He's perished. Oh my gosh, that was

01:42:05.400 --> 01:42:13.320
right. He's off of it. I don't know if I need to like unironically XP grind or something.

01:42:14.200 --> 01:42:25.400
I feel like I die. I think I'm okay. Where are we? Where are we? Oh my gosh.

01:42:27.720 --> 01:42:33.240
I don't remember the game being so hard. Do you know that? I'm just getting over here like,

01:42:33.240 --> 01:42:37.560
bro, I'm out. You don't need to worry about me. I'm gone. I'm in and out like a flash.

01:42:37.560 --> 01:42:46.520
Call me you same boat. I'm gone. 10 seconds. No, not leaves from the vein. The other one,

01:42:46.520 --> 01:42:53.800
the happier one, the two lovers one, not leaves from there. That's a sad one. Scots are nice until

01:42:53.800 --> 01:43:04.520
you tear us off. Honestly. Oh my god. Yeah, I'm trying not me to. We don't want to be sad up in

01:43:04.520 --> 01:43:16.920
here. Good times. Good vibes. Two lovers forbidden from one another and the moon ends in the way.

01:43:16.920 --> 01:43:22.280
I have no idea what it is. Stroney, you just channeled some intense dark souls energy by spam

01:43:22.280 --> 01:43:27.160
rolling away from the attackers. Honestly, though, I should probably pick up cell samples

01:43:27.160 --> 01:43:33.000
because I ended up using two revives for that. I definitely need an armor upgrade,

01:43:33.960 --> 01:43:45.880
because. Okay, ready to lovers forbidden from one another award their people

01:43:47.320 --> 01:43:58.200
and a man and evades them apart. You must build a path to be together.

01:43:59.160 --> 01:44:06.760
And I kind of forgotten how the rest of it goes, but secret tunnel, secret tunnel.

01:44:09.560 --> 01:44:18.600
It's such a good song. There we go. A little sing song for you. A little karaoke before the

01:44:18.600 --> 01:44:26.680
actual karaoke stream is planned. Have a look. I've got to stop. That will get stuck

01:44:27.400 --> 01:44:33.000
in my head for months. Oh, do you want the Scottish version of it? So it's extra cursed.

01:44:34.200 --> 01:44:37.880
Wait, someone refit the lyrics in again, and I'll do the Scottish version for you,

01:44:37.880 --> 01:44:44.600
because I'm just so kind like that. Okay, so the one thing about close combat is the instant.

01:44:45.560 --> 01:44:50.360
I said the instant die. Thank you. Right, Scottish version.

01:44:50.360 --> 01:44:57.240
If someone puts the lyrics in chat for me, just so I can go. My brain's a little slow.

01:44:59.560 --> 01:45:12.120
Two lovers forbidden from one another award evades their people and a man and Brian,

01:45:12.120 --> 01:45:15.720
you're interrupting my singing, Brian. Well, I'm getting absolutely.

01:45:15.720 --> 01:45:19.800
Award divides their people. All right. Oh, sugar. Thank you for the tip.

01:45:21.480 --> 01:45:25.960
I'm getting too distracted. I forget the next couple of lines, but then it goes.

01:45:29.720 --> 01:45:33.480
Thank you for tipping that. You didn't have to tip that. Thank you. I do appreciate anyway.

01:45:34.040 --> 01:45:38.840
Right, right. Scottish version. Two. Wait, should I do really neasily, Scots?

01:45:38.840 --> 01:45:53.320
Two lovers forbidden from one another award evades their people and a mountain divides them apart

01:45:55.320 --> 01:46:04.520
and build a path a be together. Yeah, and I forget who the next couple of lines go,

01:46:04.520 --> 01:46:17.480
but then it goes. Secret tunnel. Secret tunnel through the mountain. Secret, secret, secret,

01:46:17.480 --> 01:46:21.640
secret tunnel. I think I need to go and visit for this next section.

01:46:23.480 --> 01:46:28.280
Anyway, that's the Scots rendition. You're welcome for that on the house. Didn't even have to pick.

01:46:28.280 --> 01:46:37.560
Why Bonaro? Why? I'll go invisible if I'm going to end up perishing, I think. Whoa, whoa, whoa,

01:46:37.560 --> 01:46:44.280
whoa, whoa. Okay. These turrets on the wall are my biggest enemies. Got a lot of enemies and it's

01:46:44.280 --> 01:46:49.400
the turrets on the wall, not the actual thing. Strana, just had any idea for your outfit. What

01:46:49.400 --> 01:46:56.040
about a version with all of your modesty plasters are replaced by nicotine patches, honestly?

01:46:59.000 --> 01:47:04.680
What is going on? I don't, sorry, I really don't remember this section, so I don't know what I'm

01:47:04.680 --> 01:47:10.680
up against, but I'm just going to take it slow. Not knowing we're taking it a bit slow. I'm just

01:47:10.680 --> 01:47:16.200
a bit, I can see something over there. Oh, he's destroying the car. I see empty mechas.

01:47:17.160 --> 01:47:25.560
What's that up there? Can I destroy these for XP? Hold on.

01:47:30.200 --> 01:47:36.680
Oh, wow. Oh, I'm doing a task sector destroying empty mech. Oh, wow, they explode as well. That's

01:47:36.680 --> 01:47:42.200
actually really good to know that they explode. Okay, there we go. I press X to do that, ultimate.

01:47:43.160 --> 01:47:48.840
Strana, do I smoke? No, I just talk too long and my voice is fried. Do you need help with this?

01:47:48.840 --> 01:47:52.760
You want to gang violence this car because you're like taking your sweet time. That's going to blow

01:47:52.760 --> 01:47:59.320
up, bro. That's going to blow up. Oh, it didn't hurt him though. Oh, I get a lot of XP for doing

01:47:59.320 --> 01:48:05.880
that. I don't know if we need to farm yet. If we get too weak, we'll farm, but at the moment we are

01:48:05.880 --> 01:48:11.400
above the thingy. Watch out. I know what challenge to destroy something.

01:48:16.680 --> 01:48:23.720
This looks very battle, don't ask, but I don't recall. I just heard an Ikram. I think that was an

01:48:23.720 --> 01:48:29.080
Ikram. Is this the person we need to find? Because I don't think he's looking too good.

01:48:29.080 --> 01:48:32.440
Are you okay? Yeah, you need, you need, oh, he needs some milk.

01:48:37.240 --> 01:48:39.800
Right, I'm sorry. It was too obvious, right? That's how you get wrecked.

01:48:42.920 --> 01:48:47.080
Don't want to get hit that much, but it's literally the best I can do. All things considered.

01:48:47.080 --> 01:48:52.440
Okay, that special attack knocks them over. That's really good to know. Okay.

01:48:54.200 --> 01:48:57.400
Heal, heal, heal, heal. Okay, that bought me time, that bought me time, that bought me time.

01:48:58.360 --> 01:49:02.680
Okay, two out of three. Wait, that didn't damage me? That explosion didn't damage me.

01:49:03.800 --> 01:49:09.000
Okay, let's go. Okay, okay, that wasn't that bad. I thought that was going to be like

01:49:09.000 --> 01:49:16.840
insane battle door mask type stuff, but we're safe. Strony's inky milk. Strony's inks milky. Hold

01:49:16.840 --> 01:49:23.960
on a minute. Someone, someone described my homemade yogurt as glippy. I have not forgiven

01:49:24.040 --> 01:49:29.160
you for such descriptions since. Is there an enemy over here? Whoa.

01:49:35.720 --> 01:49:42.360
The fricking, the, wait, how much do I have to redo? Because I was like deep in that. Okay,

01:49:42.360 --> 01:49:49.640
I don't have to redo much. The plane took me away with it. I bumped away, man. I bumped away,

01:49:49.960 --> 01:49:56.360
bro. As far as I'm aware, this game has infinite lives. I probably would never have finished it

01:49:56.360 --> 01:50:04.360
if I didn't because, you know, I didn't make it. Glippy. Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

01:50:04.360 --> 01:50:10.920
I didn't, that is so cheating. They have, they had pre-spawned in. Go away. You can shoot me through

01:50:10.920 --> 01:50:14.680
that because I can't shoot you. I'm going to have to be in viz to claim up this. Oh my gosh.

01:50:14.680 --> 01:50:20.440
Where did, where did they go? Right. I need to...

01:50:24.120 --> 01:50:30.040
Oh, lovely. Okay, there we go. Yeah, I'm not one shot nothing.

01:50:31.880 --> 01:50:40.280
Just so the screen isn't too red. There. Jeez, Louise. Oh, I almost didn't make that. Can I

01:50:40.280 --> 01:50:44.520
destroy this? Oh, I can. Take that. I didn't get any XP for that. So

01:50:46.920 --> 01:50:51.400
that's great. Something. Honestly. Oh, my Icaran's here. I thought my Icaran was going to come and

01:50:51.400 --> 01:50:55.160
get me. Okay, it's because it's exploding. My Icaran is coming to get me.

01:50:55.160 --> 01:51:11.240
Okay, let's see what we're working with. Whoa. I don't like that.

01:51:16.600 --> 01:51:20.440
I messed up. I'm sorry. I even brought attention to my existence.

01:51:21.400 --> 01:51:27.000
Please, please, please. I'm just a Navi. I'm just a, I'm just a sweet innocent Navi.

01:51:27.000 --> 01:51:32.760
I'm sorry. I tried to pick on you, Mr. Car. I'm sorry. My goodness. That Warthog is powerful.

01:51:34.200 --> 01:51:44.440
Oh my goodness. It was just a little arrow. My gosh. And let me up. Literally light them up. I

01:51:44.440 --> 01:51:53.160
want that thing up. Blast it out of the sky. Oh my goodness. That was not good. Right. You're

01:51:53.160 --> 01:51:59.480
standing up now. So you feel a bit better. Good. Oh, a great warrior. Oh, you were hating on me

01:51:59.480 --> 01:52:05.080
about 20 minutes ago. Hmm. Don't think I, I didn't forget. You're, you're a little hatey.

01:52:07.240 --> 01:52:13.400
Okay. Goodbye. Oh, I'm called Dreamwalker now. I'm no longer a sky people. I'm a dream.

01:52:15.240 --> 01:52:20.520
So let me shoot an arrow at this armed vehicle. Look, I have some good ideas and I have some

01:52:20.520 --> 01:52:31.080
bad ideas. That was a bad idea. Oh, oh, there's, what the heck is this? What did I do with that?

01:52:32.120 --> 01:52:34.200
Oh, we got an unlock. What did we get?

01:52:36.760 --> 01:52:43.640
I'll look up. Invis for longer. Oh, we've got a bow and arrow upgrade and a weapon upgrade. Oh,

01:52:43.640 --> 01:52:48.280
look, her bow has changed. Look, it's a different design now. See, that literally

01:52:48.280 --> 01:52:51.560
is such a cross game. Right. What am I supposed to do with these crystals? Excuse me.

01:52:55.720 --> 01:53:01.880
I'm actually, here we go. I guess I'm to follow the crystals because it's doing the little light.

01:53:01.880 --> 01:53:10.600
So, okay. It's to follow it. I was, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, okay. We're safe.

01:53:11.080 --> 01:53:16.360
My goodness. I don't know what I need in order to survive other than an armor upgrade,

01:53:16.360 --> 01:53:21.160
but those warthogs are so unforgiving. I was a mecha as I've unlocked now.

01:53:21.160 --> 01:53:24.520
See, we're starting to get out of the tutorial where the game does not forgive.

01:53:25.800 --> 01:53:29.880
Like the game will annihilate you if you don't like level up and stuff.

01:53:29.880 --> 01:53:33.720
Oh, my horse is getting really shot out there. I didn't like that. I didn't enjoy that.

01:53:34.680 --> 01:53:38.600
More enemies. It's impassable.

01:53:41.720 --> 01:53:49.640
Oh, for God's sake. No, Mr. Horsey. Please do not. Wait. Gang violence. Gang violence. The horses.

01:53:49.640 --> 01:53:55.720
Oh, no, my horse. Oh, my horse just perished, but I saw him attack on the leaf. That's two games

01:53:55.720 --> 01:54:02.120
where the horse actually helps you. Okay. We're just going to have to take the rest on foot, sadly.

01:54:03.000 --> 01:54:10.840
Oh, oh, do they attack me if I'm Navi? I feel like. Oh, oh, it's so beautiful.

01:54:14.280 --> 01:54:19.560
Yeah, I really don't want them to attack me. I'm definitely picking up.

01:54:20.040 --> 01:54:23.160
Rider, come in. I've only got a few seconds to talk.

01:54:23.160 --> 01:54:28.200
Falco's gathering harmonics to find something called a well of souls. Well of souls.

01:54:29.080 --> 01:54:34.520
You don't say. Falco's planning to use it to wipe out the Navi. I'll try to find out more.

01:54:36.680 --> 01:54:42.200
I was hoping they didn't attack. I was hoping they didn't attack. Oh, I've gone the wrong way.

01:54:42.200 --> 01:54:46.200
I'm getting too distracted. Oh, I don't want to hurt the whale blade. It just sucks.

01:54:47.080 --> 01:54:52.440
Wait a minute. What did she call me? Raider? I hardly even know her.

01:54:57.000 --> 01:55:01.480
Oh, you didn't. You didn't like that one? I guess. Yeah, I guess I repeated it. I'm sorry.

01:55:04.680 --> 01:55:08.200
Yeah. Okay. I won't recycle jokes. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

01:55:09.000 --> 01:55:13.800
Is that? Oh, I can't see.

01:55:16.680 --> 01:55:18.600
Okay, I'm sorry, but you guys are going to have to go.

01:55:20.920 --> 01:55:24.360
I really wish they wouldn't attack. Oh, hello. Are you the person I need?

01:55:25.800 --> 01:55:33.720
Man who is not man, a Navi who is not Navi. You are a puzzle, piece of Ewa's puzzle.

01:55:33.800 --> 01:55:37.240
Oh, okay. I'm dreamwalking. Are we got an upgrade?

01:55:43.800 --> 01:55:48.040
I thought no scrawny stream today. Are you sure about that?

01:55:49.560 --> 01:55:55.320
She be a reminder. Okay. For those of you who are listening in are a part of the hair M.

01:55:55.960 --> 01:56:00.600
She be cotton bum is going live in T minus.

01:56:01.560 --> 01:56:04.040
Four minutes. She may actually be on the loading screen.

01:56:06.920 --> 01:56:12.840
Eh, but yes. If there's any new YouTube mods lurking, you are welcome to speak,

01:56:13.640 --> 01:56:16.680
but then I remove your speaking privileges instantly.

01:56:18.600 --> 01:56:22.760
Class of 09. What is Class of 09? Have you guys played that?

01:56:23.320 --> 01:56:26.760
scrawny streams never end. The return all hail the endurance cut off is.

01:56:27.080 --> 01:56:31.880
As I play the Navi part, I did it later as a human.

01:56:33.080 --> 01:56:40.520
Wrong. I've literally never done the RDA save. We will take. Oh, look how beautiful this is.

01:56:41.400 --> 01:56:43.720
Literally glowing in the dark is just stunning.

01:56:45.240 --> 01:56:49.160
Oh, could you imagine it with graphics that are updated?

01:56:49.160 --> 01:56:53.560
Like, I have no idea what's in the new avatar game. Maybe we should play it for the first

01:56:53.560 --> 01:57:00.680
time together, but I think it is as beautiful as this. Right. Why am I here? Oh, to get these crystals.

01:57:02.600 --> 01:57:05.240
Okay, we're just going to ignore.

01:57:09.880 --> 01:57:14.760
Because if we can just run in and out of these sections, if you hang around and kill anything,

01:57:14.760 --> 01:57:23.080
yes, you will get faster XP. Oh, I don't want my horse to die. I'm so sorry. Oh, Mr. Horsey,

01:57:23.160 --> 01:57:29.480
please don't die. Oh, no. Oh, no. Come on. We need to get out of here. Like right now,

01:57:29.480 --> 01:57:34.360
I don't want you to pass away. I want you to have a happy life and retire at your old age.

01:57:35.240 --> 01:57:41.720
Okay. And wait, this horse here is getting attacked as well. I was beating up that mech.

01:57:41.720 --> 01:57:45.480
I was going to actually take it so this one can live its little retirement out. But

01:57:46.600 --> 01:57:49.720
oh, I don't know if we're going to make it if they've got flipping flamethrowers and I've

01:57:49.720 --> 01:57:56.680
got the wrong way because again, all turned around. Oh, please live, little horsey, please live. Oh,

01:57:56.680 --> 01:58:00.280
no, the horsey is not going to. Right, that's it. We're clearing this. We're clearing this out.

01:58:00.280 --> 01:58:03.480
Leave my horse alone. Everything is so strong.

01:58:07.240 --> 01:58:14.760
Who? Who? Who? You, perish. Gosh. I don't have anyone to take out my special one.

01:58:14.760 --> 01:58:19.960
Right, I'm healing because we're going to end this. Wait, I actually came out in your avatar.

01:58:19.960 --> 01:58:25.160
Yeah, there's a new one. Didn't check it out. Yeah. I'm going to take more samples because

01:58:25.160 --> 01:58:31.400
I've actually only got three. Wait, how far away? It's a wee bit away. It's a wee bit away.

01:58:32.360 --> 01:58:39.000
All right, we are going to pick up cell samples just. No, my horse was still going to retirement.

01:58:39.960 --> 01:58:45.320
You're so mean. Ow. Did that plant just smack me back?

01:58:46.200 --> 01:58:52.840
Fine. My horse is already passed away. Man, he had a pension fund and everything.

01:58:54.120 --> 01:58:57.480
Imagine working your whole life. Actually, I read a story about like that

01:58:58.120 --> 01:59:01.560
where someone like worked their whole life and they got one week of retirement and passed away

01:59:01.560 --> 01:59:07.720
and it was like, I would, I would be so mad. I would be so mad. I would explain to death himself

01:59:07.720 --> 01:59:14.920
like, look, mate, I've kind of sweat my whole life. Dread Brian. By the way, I'm not sure if it was you

01:59:14.920 --> 01:59:20.840
who asked, but it was someone invalid asked if the Black Ops two servers were fixed. Me. The answer

01:59:20.840 --> 01:59:27.880
is yes, the servers were fixed, but bear in mind, it's still the Black Ops two servers. If you know

01:59:27.880 --> 01:59:37.560
you know. I remember the game couldn't be played by streamers on the basis of like a super easy

01:59:37.560 --> 01:59:46.520
to get like your IP going. But if they fixed it, honestly, Black Ops with the boys. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:59:49.080 --> 01:59:54.120
Have a little drink. Have a sipping tin. Thank you very much for the tip. Tarja, I appreciate that.

01:59:54.600 --> 02:00:00.680
Yeah. Shawnee, the horse is only looking for three days anyway. Well, in Pandora, I'm going to hang

02:00:00.680 --> 02:00:05.880
with sheep now. Yes, have fun with sheepsters. She's live with Class of O'Nane, which I actually

02:00:05.880 --> 02:00:12.200
don't know what the good is about. Imagine had reals ifs that basically happened to. Oh, I'm sorry.

02:00:13.400 --> 02:00:19.720
But yeah. Oh, we must draw harmonic from tree.

02:00:19.720 --> 02:00:30.200
Oh, I think I know where this is going to go.

02:00:30.200 --> 02:00:46.520
Oh, okay, that line delivery was a bit. No, long glory. No, we fling.

02:00:51.000 --> 02:00:57.000
I will say one thing for the VAs of this game, especially for older games in the past,

02:00:57.960 --> 02:01:03.080
odds are they had no idea what the scene actually had and they were just given a script and just said

02:01:03.880 --> 02:01:07.960
like they don't know the depth of the script or what occurred. It was only until like recent

02:01:07.960 --> 02:01:14.840
stuff like where actors can see live what they're performing. So follow the sound of vibrations

02:01:14.840 --> 02:01:16.600
and find tuning points.

02:01:25.640 --> 02:01:29.800
Okay, if there's three, it's probably going to be like identical. Yeah, okay.

02:01:31.400 --> 02:01:34.760
Wait, hold on. Yeah, okay. And then the last one's going to be like right here

02:01:35.640 --> 02:01:41.880
because of the way triangles work. Yeah, I love triangles. What's your yeah, yeah,

02:01:41.880 --> 02:01:47.640
you know what? Favorite shape. I'm going to give it in our rectangle triangle or rectangle for favorite

02:01:47.640 --> 02:01:53.000
shape. Oh, it's singing to me. Hold on. I feel like something mystical is about to happen.

02:01:53.000 --> 02:02:03.800
I'm actually getting a bit scared. I just checked. Oh, no.

02:02:04.040 --> 02:02:12.440
We must take this home back to home tree. It's a wooden delivery. Get it because of the trees.

02:02:13.480 --> 02:02:15.480
It was a wooden delivery.

02:02:18.840 --> 02:02:26.120
Oh, I came up with that myself came up with that comment myself. I'm so witty as a streamer,

02:02:26.120 --> 02:02:33.400
aren't I? I'm just going to start stealing your guys's like witty comments and then doing that over

02:02:33.800 --> 02:02:41.560
Oh, I have a new armor. New armor. Oh my god, girl game, girl game. Oh yeah, like the protection.

02:02:42.200 --> 02:02:49.800
What is vitality? More health. I have more health overall because of the armor. Yeah,

02:02:49.800 --> 02:02:55.560
well, you can see where they added more armor onto me. You have solved content creation.

02:02:56.520 --> 02:03:05.960
Oh, that's proper harmonized. Yeah, good luck hitting them.

02:03:07.960 --> 02:03:14.520
Armor barely covers anything. And honestly, like they are using right. We're going to home tree.

02:03:14.520 --> 02:03:15.800
Wait, we're going back to home tree.

02:03:18.200 --> 02:03:20.840
What? I'm about to report to them that. Oh, by the way, longer these dead.

02:03:21.560 --> 02:03:29.560
I'm going to cry from that joke literally what cry of pain or just like just like how ridiculous

02:03:29.560 --> 02:03:37.480
it was. Okay, we are going to be polite to Ewa and respect the home tree by not doing backflips

02:03:37.480 --> 02:03:44.440
all the way up the trunk of the tree. Okay. Oh my god, it's tree balls. We love tree balls.

02:03:45.320 --> 02:03:47.240
Let's just get very bright in here. I'm not going to lie.

02:03:48.600 --> 02:03:52.440
Do I need to recalibrate? Hold on. I'm like a professional streamer. I think I need to recalibrate

02:03:52.440 --> 02:04:01.320
my muscles. Okay, there we go. Recalibrating, meet your virtual, recalibrate it. Oh, yeah.

02:04:03.480 --> 02:04:09.880
Sorry. Oh, we did actually report longer is passing. Okay.

02:04:10.840 --> 02:04:14.520
You have the song. No, no, how but yeah, I scored the

02:04:17.160 --> 02:04:21.080
not the thumbs up. That was so human of you. Please don't do that again.

02:04:25.960 --> 02:04:28.920
A little tap on the shoulder. Sing.

02:04:32.200 --> 02:04:35.880
What am I saying? Am I actually to say is this like a mini game where any like

02:04:39.880 --> 02:04:42.920
what on earth is this freaky stuff going on here?

02:04:48.120 --> 02:04:52.920
I don't even remember that at all. Thumbs up. Let's just try to come there.

02:04:53.800 --> 02:04:57.560
It is the first step in our path. How many steps we got?

02:04:58.760 --> 02:05:07.000
Find location is one step. Okay. Speaking to Ewa is another. Okay. This demands the need of a

02:05:07.960 --> 02:05:14.760
the first voice. Only the first voice awakens well of souls. So this is campaign mode getting

02:05:14.760 --> 02:05:21.000
explained to us. I totally know the plot inside out from this game. Yeah.

02:05:22.680 --> 02:05:24.600
Assassin's Creed. I know the plot of this.

02:05:28.440 --> 02:05:31.800
All I know is that we're doing good for the planet. Easy on the mumbo-jumbo stuff.

02:05:31.800 --> 02:05:34.280
No, please, even if not directed at me, they hurt anyway.

02:05:37.960 --> 02:05:42.280
What if the trees wanted to see a sick backflip?

02:05:45.560 --> 02:05:53.080
Mission complete. Mission complete. Oh, not to jump around. Jump up. Can I put my weapons away?

02:05:53.080 --> 02:05:57.720
I feel like having weapons out in this location isn't very pleasant. No, put the RDA gun on me.

02:06:01.160 --> 02:06:05.960
Why is this so bright? I don't ever... Oh my god. I don't ever recall that issue.

02:06:07.320 --> 02:06:13.720
Hmm. Oh, hello again. I would like to talk to you for my next mission.

02:06:13.720 --> 02:06:16.280
We go to Toroknari. Toroknari.

02:06:17.720 --> 02:06:22.920
I hear the human Thalco seeks your death. We will not let this happen.

02:06:22.920 --> 02:06:26.600
You know, spending five years in cryo. Thank you, Tenjala.

02:06:27.480 --> 02:06:32.040
War is new to this world. It must not happen again. Never on the enemy side.

02:06:32.120 --> 02:06:34.520
But we're the goodies, so they're the enemy.

02:06:37.080 --> 02:06:45.640
We're healing nature. We're healing nature. Mother nature always reclaims all. Mother,

02:06:45.640 --> 02:06:54.600
mother, mother, mother nature. Oh, this looks like a dark room out. Beautiful.

02:06:54.840 --> 02:07:01.240
Toph is the Marvel boy? I can't really do later voices like Toph.

02:07:02.200 --> 02:07:09.640
Oh, Katana. Look, there's the castle. That's what I would say if I could see

02:07:10.760 --> 02:07:14.680
something. If I wasn't blind. I can't really hear a voice at all.

02:07:17.880 --> 02:07:22.280
Is it a castle? There's something in the sand or the library? There's the library.

02:07:24.600 --> 02:07:28.120
Katana. Oh, sorry. It's not Katana. Sorry, sorry, sorry.

02:07:31.560 --> 02:07:33.720
It's upside down, isn't it?

02:07:36.920 --> 02:07:43.400
Katana? Close enough. I know. I know. Katana wins. Good luck, Tenjala. Good luck, Tenjala.

02:07:43.400 --> 02:07:47.080
All right. Good luck, Tenjala. Hi. Oh, who's this? Hello. How do you do?

02:07:47.080 --> 02:07:51.480
You come for shards. That must wait. Oh, I need a pause on the shards.

02:07:51.560 --> 02:07:52.520
Post-trump on the shards.

02:07:57.640 --> 02:08:00.760
A little cheeky hydration check. A little cheeky hydration.

02:08:05.480 --> 02:08:10.680
There's the library. That's the way it would sound like the phone about the body.

02:08:10.680 --> 02:08:21.800
Longer speak. Oh, okay. I'm going to say something controversial.

02:08:22.520 --> 02:08:30.120
You know when maps are straight ahead like this? Yeah? I like that. I appreciate when games don't

02:08:30.120 --> 02:08:37.480
make you go back and forth and you just keep going forward. When a game makes you turn around

02:08:37.480 --> 02:08:40.760
to go do something on the map that you previously had that area.

02:08:45.960 --> 02:08:50.600
However, when a game makes it nice and linear,

02:08:53.160 --> 02:08:56.920
not going to lie, I almost fell off there. Oh, and I can't actually see where I'm supposed to go.

02:08:56.920 --> 02:09:03.720
Thanks to this leaf. Oh, here we go. Backtrack. Hey, yeah, backtracking a bit.

02:09:03.720 --> 02:09:13.560
Okay, let's see how it goes. Okay, so if you take the high ground,

02:09:14.840 --> 02:09:20.200
wait, look, that's why they attack me. They've got backpacks on the wolves and that's why they

02:09:20.200 --> 02:09:28.280
attack me. The RDA put like main control devices on the wolves and now they want to attack me even

02:09:28.280 --> 02:09:36.280
though I'm Navi. I'm Navi and I'm navigating. What the heck am I doing here? Am I destroying stuff?

02:09:38.360 --> 02:09:39.800
Don't have to ask me twice.

02:09:42.120 --> 02:09:48.120
What am I doing? Challenge complete, right? I'm going to do it from up here. Oh, I see.

02:09:49.080 --> 02:09:59.320
So I'm releasing the native Navi and destroying them. Jesus. Why? Yeah, we're like literally

02:09:59.320 --> 02:10:07.560
so low level. We're not even one shotting. Can I break you? Oh, I can't.

02:10:11.080 --> 02:10:17.160
I like how he just don't. Oh, he like dives over. I mean, honestly, if an arrow struck me,

02:10:17.640 --> 02:10:23.800
probably. Oh, we did it. Like Ori in the blank forest.

02:10:26.200 --> 02:10:33.960
I true. Wait, wait, wait. What am I supposed to do with that? Destroy it? I'm just going to pump.

02:10:33.960 --> 02:10:38.600
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Let me pump all the ammo into it. Where's my gun? I can't.

02:10:39.240 --> 02:10:49.800
Yeah, your height, you're teasing me. I'm not even hitting you, bro. You're literally right under

02:10:49.800 --> 02:10:55.880
the tree. I'm going to have to go. No, stop shooting me. I need to destroy this.

02:10:56.280 --> 02:11:10.920
Hello. Oh, wait. Oh, wait. Oh, no. Game. Game.

02:11:14.280 --> 02:11:20.440
Did I need to hit the other side of it, I guess? Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,

02:11:21.240 --> 02:11:23.560
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

02:11:23.560 --> 02:11:31.160
Okay, done. Jeez, Louise. They are killing us here. That was very strange, but we did it.

02:11:31.160 --> 02:11:36.920
That's the main thing. Right here. We should not. Are you trying to shoot that guy and you're missing

02:11:36.920 --> 02:11:42.680
like horribly? Oh, you are. Oh, and I'm missing horribly too. You know that both of us are as

02:11:42.680 --> 02:11:52.360
bad as each other. He healed as I, bro, come on. Hello, would you like to talk to me?

02:11:54.840 --> 02:11:56.200
Oh, I'll just keep talking.

02:12:01.880 --> 02:12:09.000
Backtracking works if the map is good. Yes, I would argue yes. I did try and play Ori in the

02:12:09.000 --> 02:12:17.400
blind forest, but I was just too paid to pay go. It's definitely not a stream game for me, but one

02:12:17.400 --> 02:12:24.440
of the other girls most likely would play it. I feel like it's a, I definitely chill stream, chill

02:12:24.440 --> 02:12:29.960
stream. Yeah. This is actually a really beautiful map because you get to run along the little tree

02:12:29.960 --> 02:12:33.320
roots, which I really like. Yay, nature. Nature wins again.

02:12:36.280 --> 02:12:43.880
Uh, right. I can see, and we're maybe fighting here or are we,

02:12:46.760 --> 02:12:52.360
huh, are we just running through this? Oh, wow. We actually did pretty decent damage.

02:12:53.400 --> 02:12:57.800
Yeah. Wow. I'll take that. I don't, I don't, I think that was just a payable drill haul.

02:13:00.040 --> 02:13:07.240
Super. Are they cute? I can only, I'm okay. Hold on. I, it doesn't seem like an objective area

02:13:07.240 --> 02:13:13.160
because of that reason. I'm just going to do this. I know I shouldn't. I know I should probably like

02:13:13.160 --> 02:13:17.160
level up a bit, but I am very happy just to keep walking on the tree trunks.

02:13:17.880 --> 02:13:23.000
You want a non chill stream? Place a list. I've seen a lot of streamers place a list. Like,

02:13:23.080 --> 02:13:29.720
it's interesting to see what like, um, oh, I'm in trouble. Uh, oh, I'm in trouble. Oh, I'm in trouble.

02:13:31.800 --> 02:13:37.000
Oh my goodness. I do not remember being in so much trouble playing this game.

02:13:37.560 --> 02:13:42.040
What's the way? I think it's maybe I used to farm areas to level up and I was just so OP

02:13:42.600 --> 02:13:47.320
because I think this map, we're actually supposed to be unlocking a green

02:13:48.280 --> 02:13:51.560
armor right now, but I ain't doing it.

02:13:52.520 --> 02:13:57.720
Apologize dude. Just doing some backflip, literally backflip dodge and bullets.

02:13:57.720 --> 02:14:01.960
Right. We're getting ready to attack these guys, but I need to actually activate the quest by

02:14:01.960 --> 02:14:07.240
talking to this guy before we attack and release more of Pandora's. Me?

02:14:08.440 --> 02:14:14.760
How can I help? You would not like my answer. Listen, like it or not, you've got my help on this one.

02:14:15.480 --> 02:14:19.400
String. The tattooed lord of sky machines with weapons.

02:14:20.920 --> 02:14:24.840
Was it, I think for anyone who did actually watch the first Avatar movie,

02:14:24.840 --> 02:14:29.640
I think scum means like idiot or something like that. Like scum. You have to go like scum.

02:14:29.640 --> 02:14:30.680
Or else you're not saying it right.

02:14:37.160 --> 02:14:41.800
Yeah, I feel like I replayed and leveled up a lot more as a child and right now we're just like

02:14:41.800 --> 02:14:45.160
speedrunning through this. Although when you do complete a mission, you do get like a nice

02:14:45.160 --> 02:14:52.200
chunk of XP. So speaking of leveling up, I have a six minute timer at the top of the screen.

02:14:55.160 --> 02:15:00.840
That looks like a protection spell that I am putting on. I didn't realize I unlocked some

02:15:00.840 --> 02:15:05.880
sort of protection thing. I definitely want to put whatever that is. Greatly reduces. Yeah,

02:15:05.880 --> 02:15:12.360
okay. Yeah, we'll definitely be utilizing that right woman to do. Right, let's test this out.

02:15:14.760 --> 02:15:19.320
I'm about to destroy the ship. Jump up here.

02:15:22.840 --> 02:15:29.960
Hello. Oh wait, I can just, yeah. Is this what I'm supposed to destroy?

02:15:30.520 --> 02:15:37.240
Oh yeah, okay, it is. Oh yeah, take that. You like that? Yeah, you're like a big adult. Oh,

02:15:37.240 --> 02:15:41.000
am I going to get a blood raid because it's facing me now? I'm getting, I'm getting shaky,

02:15:41.000 --> 02:15:47.480
I'm getting scared. Okay, we're fine, we're fine. Like honestly, smooth sailing. Okay,

02:15:47.480 --> 02:15:52.680
the NPCs aren't really locking onto me too well because of the distance. But we're making it,

02:15:52.680 --> 02:15:57.640
we're making it. They're getting a bit closer, so we might have to actually start shooting them

02:15:58.200 --> 02:16:03.960
a wee bit, just a wee bit. Oh, that was a good shot there. One more, and then that's three of four.

02:16:05.240 --> 02:16:11.160
You're telling me that quad aerial thing can stay up with three? I don't believe it.

02:16:12.280 --> 02:16:20.840
One more, two more. I'm not hitting that at all. It's not registering. I'm just going to spam it

02:16:21.640 --> 02:16:22.600
in. Am I supposed to go up?

02:16:25.560 --> 02:16:30.840
Of course, the thing I want is like not facing me. Is this one in the corner?

02:16:32.520 --> 02:16:35.320
Okay, there we go. Hey, wait, wait, I just, I'm looking at it.

02:16:38.280 --> 02:16:46.360
Sound like a human iron birdie, I'm just saying. Literally. The steel a crann is no match for me.

02:16:46.360 --> 02:16:52.040
I'm going to loot this stuff. I've got three revives. Oh my gosh.

02:16:54.360 --> 02:17:00.120
Oh, the poor babies, they're not even attacking us. Out you come, baby. Wait, so, okay, it looks like

02:17:00.120 --> 02:17:12.680
regular ones don't attack me anymore. Hello? Yes. I think we're going to raid him.

02:17:16.680 --> 02:17:24.680
Oh, they're so cute. We're helping the little forest critters.

02:17:27.960 --> 02:17:31.560
What do you need? I'm sorry, medications for the big guy.

02:17:33.000 --> 02:17:38.040
Oh, just basic flowers. That's fine. I can get that. That's no problem. Hold on. Hold that thought,

02:17:38.120 --> 02:17:45.720
little guy. I'm coming back. And then I think we get to ride him into battle like a horse,

02:17:45.720 --> 02:17:52.520
but it's not a horse. I think it's called a Thanator. If I remember correctly. Oh my goodness.

02:17:52.520 --> 02:17:55.640
I remember that time I said in this map, you don't have to backtrack.

02:17:57.720 --> 02:18:02.360
Honestly, it's not that bad though, because it's to help an animal. And, you know, we

02:18:03.080 --> 02:18:07.160
shadow wizard money gang. We love healing nature from these parts.

02:18:09.800 --> 02:18:18.520
I'm going in. Oh, I'm getting sprayed and prayed, but they can't get me. I'm too good.

02:18:21.080 --> 02:18:27.640
Gather plants from the banshee's nest. Oh, that's what that is. I suppose we'd be comfortable with

02:18:27.640 --> 02:18:36.760
that. Pandora is Ohio, but more natural. You're not allowed to speak for the next 20 seconds.

02:18:36.760 --> 02:18:41.000
Do you understand me? Don't say that again.

02:18:48.040 --> 02:18:53.240
I'm so excited for your ace mushroom. I just want new earbuds for it. I hope it's not a

02:18:53.240 --> 02:18:59.160
disappointment. I most likely will not do ear licking. I'm just going to say that now before

02:18:59.160 --> 02:19:04.920
anyone gets thingied. I have no idea what an earth is going on with YouTube and ear licking at the

02:19:04.920 --> 02:19:12.120
moment. Something, there's either a policy update being pushed or something, but for some reason anime

02:19:12.120 --> 02:19:19.640
ear licks bad. In real life, human person ear licks fine. So I don't want you to be disciplined.

02:19:19.640 --> 02:19:24.360
I have put a lot of thought and effort into it, so hopefully the Acemari is good. I don't know how

02:19:24.360 --> 02:19:29.080
long I'm going to stream for. And the problem is I get really distracted when I constantly

02:19:29.080 --> 02:19:33.480
read your guys' stuff because you guys make me laugh all the time. So I'm not really sure how

02:19:33.480 --> 02:19:40.440
official an Acemari is going to be. I'll probably try hard for like 15 minutes and then it's just

02:19:40.520 --> 02:19:49.480
going to... Oh, that's so cool. Has Ava gone mad? No, Ava has blisters.

02:19:51.800 --> 02:19:58.840
Whiskers, honestly though. We whiskers. It's impossible because YouTube can't tell the difference.

02:19:59.640 --> 02:20:07.320
That's my theory at the moment is that anime is getting... because YouTube are saying it's implied

02:20:07.320 --> 02:20:13.080
else. Whereas we all know what actual ear licking sounds like because it's literally a 3D microphone.

02:20:14.280 --> 02:20:26.280
So it's really put in a bit of a hindrance on my plans. Oh my gosh. Is this not the coolest ride

02:20:26.280 --> 02:20:34.680
you've ever seen? Oh my god, it's so cool. Oh, he leaves. Can he go faster? Oh, he attacks.

02:20:35.480 --> 02:20:41.880
Oh, that's so cool. Can he jump? Oh no, that's not jump. Oh wait, wait. Do I move as it moves?

02:20:41.880 --> 02:20:52.440
Oh, oh man. Can you jump? Oh, I love him. He's so slick looking. Like genuinely so slick.

02:20:53.880 --> 02:21:00.680
Not a hair on him. How do you keep warm? I'm fine. Like almost. Laughing was the highlight you'll be

02:21:00.680 --> 02:21:09.240
fine. Come on, buddy. Come on, whiskers. Let's get him. Wait, am I going back? Oh, I'm just going back

02:21:09.240 --> 02:21:14.040
to talk. It's just like, literally, it looks like he's been dropped in tar or the perv thing,

02:21:14.040 --> 02:21:18.040
but it's just how he is. A little hairless thing. I don't like hearing this kind of stuff.

02:21:23.080 --> 02:21:27.160
Okay. Why?

02:21:27.800 --> 02:21:33.800
Do not speak like you understand. Why is she so informal when talking to this guy?

02:21:34.600 --> 02:21:39.560
You have to pick your battles, B. This guy is speaking a second language. At least try and

02:21:39.560 --> 02:21:43.960
speak clear English, you know? So it's easier for him. Danny, go back before it's forward. Okay.

02:21:43.960 --> 02:21:49.800
There we go. You ready, whiskers? Oh, I did not mean to do that, but that was absolutely horrifying.

02:21:50.600 --> 02:21:52.200
Right. Come on, whiskers. Let's get him.

02:21:58.200 --> 02:22:02.200
Hopefully you have a lot of health, whiskers, because I'm not doing any combat at all.

02:22:04.120 --> 02:22:13.640
Ah, whiskers. Can you go across this stuff? You can. Oh, you're actually such a smart kitty,

02:22:13.640 --> 02:22:20.440
honestly. You're a smart kitty. Okay. I auto-jump if it's quite a... Oh, there's a

02:22:21.080 --> 02:22:25.560
two, please don't attack, question mark. I don't think they attack me anymore.

02:22:27.160 --> 02:22:33.880
Speaking of contact, the enemy's got a lot of enemies. Okay. We're all good.

02:22:33.880 --> 02:22:38.760
Whiskers made it into a happy attack. There's another whiz... How many whiskers are there out

02:22:38.840 --> 02:22:44.360
there? There's so many of them again. Bingoes. Some mate like the...

02:22:49.880 --> 02:22:51.480
What is going on in the background?

02:22:55.480 --> 02:23:02.760
Uh, cutscene moment? Cutscene moment, hello? Cutscene moment, hello?

02:23:02.840 --> 02:23:06.520
Oh, I think I'm stuck in it.

02:23:14.360 --> 02:23:17.160
Just absolutely chaos in the background, by the way.

02:23:22.840 --> 02:23:28.760
Endgame... Oh, and we've got to level up as well. Right, we need to help out that whiskers.

02:23:29.480 --> 02:23:34.440
Right, hold on. Leave whiskers alone. What's going on here?

02:23:36.360 --> 02:23:39.240
Stop it. Wait, what's going on?

02:23:43.080 --> 02:23:46.520
Right, I'm just going to do melee for the sticks. It's just so easy and quick.

02:23:47.480 --> 02:23:59.080
Why no health? Why no health? I'm doing my spell. Am I supposed to be on whiskers?

02:23:59.080 --> 02:24:03.720
I think I'm supposed to be on whiskers. Tear them up, whiskers! Tear them up!

02:24:04.600 --> 02:24:07.800
That's right. Who's a good kitty? You're going to get some treaties after this.

02:24:08.600 --> 02:24:16.200
I'm just going to do whiskers for the crazy in the background, honestly.

02:24:18.760 --> 02:24:25.000
Just a reminder that Sheevee Cottonbump is alive if you care to watch classes all night.

02:24:30.040 --> 02:24:35.400
Oh, this is so cool. Oh no, my kitty's losing health. I can't heal him.

02:24:37.800 --> 02:24:42.600
Oh, baby. I don't want you to perish. I want you to have happy retirement.

02:24:45.960 --> 02:24:50.680
Oh, there's no way kitty's going to deal with these mechs without being perished.

02:24:52.040 --> 02:24:55.400
Unless I put him away. Right, you stay there.

02:24:59.240 --> 02:25:04.360
Oh, my goodness. And I don't have my protection spell yet.

02:25:07.960 --> 02:25:14.600
I don't have protection spell. I'm literally... Oh, kitty, I might need you back. Kitty, I might need

02:25:14.600 --> 02:25:25.560
you back. Kitty, where are you? Kitty, you're saving me, kitty. Yes, knock them over. Yes! Yes,

02:25:25.560 --> 02:25:31.640
oh, you're so smart. You're so smart. You're so smart. Oh, you're such a good party party.

02:25:32.360 --> 02:25:36.440
Right, I do need to heal in a moment, but I think we're doing all right. What's going on here?

02:25:37.080 --> 02:25:40.840
You're... You've glitched out and you're not even fighting alongside me, so that's fine.

02:25:45.080 --> 02:25:49.880
Oh, the kitty... Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, heal, heal, heal, heal, heal, heal.

02:25:50.840 --> 02:25:58.520
Oh, I've casted protection. I've casted protection. I did crash protection, but I was too late because

02:25:58.520 --> 02:26:04.840
I healed first. I should have done it. Okay, okay, we can do that. This is super easy to get them.

02:26:05.800 --> 02:26:09.800
Where are they? Where's all the ones? Where are they?

02:26:11.960 --> 02:26:19.000
Two more? Oh, there you are. Okay, we're done. Oh, there's three more. I'm telling you, peppers.

02:26:22.600 --> 02:26:30.200
Hopefully, the cat didn't die then. Okay. Actually, I'm gonna... Oh, wait, no, this is

02:26:30.840 --> 02:26:36.520
okay. Right, okay. Yes, yes, yes, this turns to the corpus.

02:26:40.600 --> 02:26:43.080
I cast skill issue, honestly.

02:26:49.080 --> 02:26:56.040
Okay. Yes, we can do that. One more shard and then we do a song. A little song and dance.

02:26:57.000 --> 02:27:08.120
Oh, I crammed. Oh, that is really rough. That was a rough landing with the animation on the

02:27:08.120 --> 02:27:15.720
navi there. I have to admit, you're bending with the element there. Right, let's unlock the home

02:27:15.720 --> 02:27:21.080
tree. No, not home tree. Tree of vision, which lets you teleport around the map. Yeah, it was

02:27:21.080 --> 02:27:27.720
crunchy. That was crunchy. That was 2009 showing. I never know how long these bigger games take to

02:27:27.720 --> 02:27:34.200
develop. I still think it's like three years development, two years development. This smallest

02:27:34.200 --> 02:27:39.240
development game tank crunch I ever heard was Fallout New Vegas. That was like big like that.

02:27:40.360 --> 02:27:47.640
I think they said it was 11 months development, which was crazy, all things considered.

02:27:48.360 --> 02:27:52.840
Uh, I think we just walked the rest of the

02:28:00.040 --> 02:28:05.320
Raider hardly even or anything else to brighten my day.

02:28:06.760 --> 02:28:08.840
Okay, so I'll stop making that joke. I'm sorry.

02:28:09.000 --> 02:28:12.600
It's a ticking time bomb. We can't let Fowler get anywhere near the well.

02:28:15.800 --> 02:28:17.640
She's can't keep getting away with it.

02:28:19.560 --> 02:28:25.720
Hey, am I supposed to find my Gornu? Are you feel health, kitty? Oh, you're not even

02:28:25.720 --> 02:28:30.440
readable, actually. I'm not supposed to read them anymore. Yeah, I know. I know. Right. I won't do

02:28:30.440 --> 02:28:37.080
it anymore. God, give it some bit. A 15 year old game. Look, look, look. They did actually come

02:28:37.400 --> 02:28:43.880
some pretty decent games like back then. Are you squidding me right now? Oh, Brian. Last one for

02:28:43.880 --> 02:28:49.400
today. I got to go night night. Good night. Thank you for the tip, Virginia. Good night,

02:28:49.400 --> 02:28:56.600
and I'll see you in the morning. How long are you two hours in? So statistically we have like

02:28:56.600 --> 02:29:04.440
four. Oh, no, no one's sleeping in four hours. I'm a nation must die. Do you wish to help us or

02:29:04.440 --> 02:29:10.360
not? Yes, I'll help you, my goodness. Honestly, yeah, you actually do deserve a bit sass. Right,

02:29:10.360 --> 02:29:20.360
we're okay. Yeah, just go ahead. Whoa. What am I supposed? What animal? Am I supposed to eliminate?

02:29:22.920 --> 02:29:27.880
Oh, actual cutscene. Yeah, we do not get actual cutscenes like this often.

02:29:28.040 --> 02:29:40.360
Oh. Oh, sorry, I'm petting my hair right now. My hair is up in a bun.

02:29:43.400 --> 02:29:45.560
I'd rather that sounded rather old.

02:29:48.360 --> 02:29:53.960
Two and a half. Stony, you get one more of those jokes for all your jokes become unfunny.

02:29:53.960 --> 02:29:59.000
I don't have any more sound effects to do it with. I don't have any more sound effects.

02:30:00.120 --> 02:30:03.720
That's them all. So I can't make the joke again. I've only got crickets now.

02:30:09.720 --> 02:30:14.040
I really don't like hurting these guys, but if they're baddies, there's nothing I can really be.

02:30:15.320 --> 02:30:20.760
I give you, I send you back to Awa. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. There's a lot more of

02:30:20.760 --> 02:30:27.240
you in this plane, this pen than I thought. Jeez. What am I supposed to destroy in here? That.

02:30:32.040 --> 02:30:39.480
Uh, I hope this works. Uh, I cast protection. I cast protect- I re-

02:30:43.160 --> 02:30:47.080
I'm stuck in the corner. I cast protection.

02:30:47.240 --> 02:30:55.320
Okay, thank God this game is so buggy. Oh, I didn't mean to do that. I didn't mean to heal. I wasted that heal.

02:30:57.480 --> 02:31:03.000
Oh, this is making me nervous. Haha, you can't come on the rock. You can't come on the rock.

02:31:04.520 --> 02:31:10.200
Most games for older games, elevation really bugs out the AIs that they have. So don't be afraid to

02:31:10.200 --> 02:31:16.840
use elevation to your advantage because then you get moments like this where you can just have

02:31:16.840 --> 02:31:23.400
a good time because they can't get on the elevation. Okay, for you. Glad that's over because that is

02:31:23.400 --> 02:31:29.960
really not an easy enemy to defeat in the world. My gaspan bug rug. Shawnee, you seem to have upgraded

02:31:30.760 --> 02:31:39.000
upgrades available top left. Wait, actually though. No, I don't, I don't, unless it's that.

02:31:39.000 --> 02:31:41.160
Greatly improved damage for a short amount of time.

02:31:41.320 --> 02:31:49.960
Hmm. Yeah, like for some reason, if you don't like tab over these, it'll constantly tell you you have like weapon upgrades and stuff.

02:31:52.040 --> 02:31:59.880
What else have I got? Yeah, so like things get more like stronger as we progress.

02:32:01.160 --> 02:32:04.680
I could do a club, honestly. Let's see the club. What does it look like?

02:32:05.400 --> 02:32:14.120
Oh, that's a meaty swing. Oh, that's a load up though to get that. That's quite a load up.

02:32:15.640 --> 02:32:23.080
Oh, yeah, that it doesn't. Okay. No, this is for these guys. It's the double. It's the double for me.

02:32:25.240 --> 02:32:31.000
Oh, why would you guys even be in a broken facility? Be honest, right now.

02:32:34.840 --> 02:32:37.880
Oh, why? How are you even getting me through a fence?

02:32:40.200 --> 02:32:44.680
Well, I need to aim. You need to reload. So which one of us is going to go down first?

02:32:46.040 --> 02:32:54.440
Yeah, the club's too slow. I'm just gonna go for it. Okay. Yeah, one shot with the things I'll take.

02:32:54.440 --> 02:33:00.120
Is there anyone else here? I hear him. I hear him. I can't see him. Oh, he's so tiny.

02:33:00.920 --> 02:33:05.240
Oh, you're so tiny. I can't even see it. Ha, ha, ha. You're welcome.

02:33:05.960 --> 02:33:08.840
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

02:33:08.840 --> 02:33:11.560
Gang up, on, gang up, on. That's what I get for making a joke.

02:33:14.600 --> 02:33:15.560
Spank, spank, spank.

02:33:18.760 --> 02:33:21.640
Hello, scrawny. There was no notification for your human discord.

02:33:23.560 --> 02:33:29.080
Discord hates me. I can't believe it. I'm not discord's little kitten or whatever. I said anything

02:33:29.080 --> 02:33:35.380
that thing. Shibi is live right now with Classable 9 if that game is more of an

02:33:35.380 --> 02:33:38.600
interest to you because I'm literally playing the most like unknown game ever.

02:33:38.600 --> 02:33:45.160
I don't know if this game out on PlayStation and that as well. I don't

02:33:45.160 --> 02:33:53.680
remember it being... oh there's a Thanator in here. Where is it? Oh I hear it. Where is it?

02:33:54.320 --> 02:33:58.880
Oh it's literally right there. We'll just spray it down.

02:34:03.760 --> 02:34:08.320
Oh I'm already out of ammo. Oh I thought I thought I thought I thought I was going to be like

02:34:08.960 --> 02:34:16.080
coded. Oh okay now he's not coded to go any further. I was going to say I'm like I didn't

02:34:16.080 --> 02:34:22.160
think it was coded to go any further. This is another thing about older games. You can like

02:34:22.240 --> 02:34:28.560
just absolutely smurf them because there's only so much game memory and game storage that they

02:34:28.560 --> 02:34:34.640
can allocate for areas which means coding wise they will just stop enemies from doing stuff like

02:34:34.640 --> 02:34:39.760
that. I just love it. I appreciate it so much. Like it just makes everything nice and easy.

02:34:39.760 --> 02:34:45.920
Peasy lemon squeezy. What you got to complain about? Huh? What you got to complain about?

02:34:46.560 --> 02:34:50.640
I know the game did come out on PlayStation 3. Okay okay so it wasn't... I didn't think it was an

02:34:50.640 --> 02:34:58.720
Xbox exclusive but I don't think it ever got released on Steam. What? I don't know. Hi it's

02:34:58.720 --> 02:35:05.120
done. It's done. Hydration check. Your own people would not have you so you come to us.

02:35:06.000 --> 02:35:10.960
I'm gaming. I'm not doing this for me. There's a lot more to cheese. I'm cheeseing it. I'm not smurfing

02:35:10.960 --> 02:35:17.760
it. Cheeseing it. Do you think I enjoy this? How much do I need to play for that? I've never

02:35:17.760 --> 02:35:22.720
done it. I've genuinely never done it. I don't think so you don't need to pay anything at all. I've

02:35:22.720 --> 02:35:32.320
gone to an RDA. I assume the RDA is just like congrats you've destroyed the planet thanks

02:35:32.320 --> 02:35:41.200
and then the credits just roll. That's how I imagine the RDA side ends. Are you proud of yourself

02:35:41.200 --> 02:35:50.240
for beating a helpless NPC? Hold on I'm getting rolled. Oh my armor! I just noticed that my armor.

02:35:50.240 --> 02:35:55.120
Oh my god girl moment. Oh my god fashion show. Fashion. I've got a passion. Whoa look at that

02:35:55.120 --> 02:36:00.880
protection walk. Are you squidding me right now? Today I learned that if you click on the hashtag

02:36:00.880 --> 02:36:06.240
smuttlefish hashtag in the stream description one of the first videos shown is the pufferfish

02:36:06.800 --> 02:36:12.080
gagging on a character video. Truly perfect. Actually thank you for the tip. Sorry y'all.

02:36:12.080 --> 02:36:25.600
Oh that poor little guy. But yeah fashion show momento. So human basic armor. A little bit

02:36:25.600 --> 02:36:31.200
of an upgrade and then we've got like location based armor. I knew it so hopefully we can take

02:36:31.200 --> 02:36:45.040
a wall open now because are we faster as well? Oh who's here? Oh why are you here? This is Navi.

02:36:46.240 --> 02:36:51.440
I'm destroying Pandora just trying to input these guys. Let me put my glycs on. Can I see none?

02:36:51.680 --> 02:37:02.160
I'm invisible. You shouldn't be shitting me anymore. I'm literally invisible.

02:37:05.600 --> 02:37:09.920
Am I going to heal naturally or do I need a pulp to heal? I need a pulp to heal.

02:37:13.200 --> 02:37:20.080
Take this. Oh I see the TNT thing. I'm going to grab the crystal before it gets me as I don't

02:37:20.160 --> 02:37:27.840
go to craft. Get me out here. Get me out here. Get me out here. Oh that sprint is so good. Oh my

02:37:27.840 --> 02:37:34.960
I just came out of nowhere. He blinked and he was gone. Oh need to pick up more samples. Oh get me

02:37:34.960 --> 02:37:39.840
out of here. There's too much. If they start having like knock back that's when it gets dangerous

02:37:39.840 --> 02:37:44.720
like being in the middle of the enemies. So do forgive me if I literally just blow past all these

02:37:44.720 --> 02:37:54.640
sections. Oh I can do that. That's fine. That's fine. That's fine. Okay okay we're we're getting

02:37:56.880 --> 02:38:03.040
so mo. Oh that's such a good thing. Ah see when they do that they stall you. That's when you get

02:38:03.040 --> 02:38:17.680
this. Oh no no no. It's literally TNT in the sky. Okay we made it. We made it. Let me just

02:38:17.680 --> 02:38:26.640
unlock this little tree of vision. You can't see me no. The vitality and protection boost.

02:38:26.720 --> 02:38:32.000
Yeah. What about the corp? Did you find out why they're pulling out? Why are you pulling out?

02:38:32.000 --> 02:38:36.080
Hmm. You don't want to pull out there?

02:38:40.880 --> 02:38:47.040
Okay we've got our second song so does that mean we need to do a third song and then we're

02:38:47.520 --> 02:38:49.360
who? Am I to talk to? The Banshee?

02:38:52.480 --> 02:38:52.960
Teleport?

02:38:55.120 --> 02:38:56.400
Wait what am I supposed to do?

02:38:58.800 --> 02:39:03.200
It's on to happen. It says yellow on the map. Am I supposed to read the ikran?

02:39:04.400 --> 02:39:12.720
No. I'm sorry I wasn't paying attention. The willow tree? The willow tree?

02:39:13.440 --> 02:39:19.840
Am I to use this to teleport to here to get to home tree?

02:39:23.120 --> 02:39:23.440
What?

02:39:26.400 --> 02:39:32.160
Wait was there a thing back? No not conquest. No not conquest. No no no no. We don't want to do

02:39:32.160 --> 02:39:36.480
conquest. You must do it at the end of the game. No no no. I already know how to play. Thank you. No

02:39:37.040 --> 02:39:42.000
conquest. Not now. Was there something I was supposed to pick up back there? I feel like I

02:39:42.320 --> 02:39:53.280
don't know. Child support scary. Is there a crystal? Oh dumb. Dumb dumb dumb dumb. Gee I wonder

02:39:53.280 --> 02:39:58.320
if it's supposed to go here on this conveniently place little island thing. Okay I was gonna

02:39:58.320 --> 02:40:04.960
I need something. Now what was the third one here? Yeah okay okay don't make it too don't make it too

02:40:04.960 --> 02:40:08.240
obvious video game devs don't even need yellow paint in this game.

02:40:12.400 --> 02:40:18.640
Okay we have the song. My apologies. I was rather confused there.

02:40:22.880 --> 02:40:32.160
I'm becoming na-vi na-vi na-vi na-vi. You bring hope for the future. Give our call. We bring this song

02:40:32.160 --> 02:40:39.440
before ta-i. The battle moves swiftly. I fear humans are a step ahead of us. We must return song to

02:40:39.840 --> 02:40:47.120
home. Mercy's just DM'd me. Strongly my alt twitter's growing really fast. I'm scared

02:40:49.120 --> 02:40:51.680
but under the tweet I'm getting nervous. Should I post this?

02:40:53.520 --> 02:41:05.440
Yeah you can post what you want. I'm gonna reply. Mercy you can you can post what you like my darling

02:41:06.000 --> 02:41:10.320
whether whoever makes you happy. Yeah I have replied to Mercy.

02:41:14.000 --> 02:41:19.360
Farah Yandere she sure does love being like on ironic this is gonna sound really weird when I

02:41:19.360 --> 02:41:23.120
say this out loud. She sure does love being a good girl and getting permission for everything

02:41:23.680 --> 02:41:32.640
Farah Yandere. Like literally all of the girls are so fantastic. And so we're slowly getting

02:41:32.640 --> 02:41:38.800
past the stage of do I need permission to do this? Because the answer is always no you do not

02:41:38.800 --> 02:41:45.120
need my permission you're in control. So I was the same. The best kind of Yandere.

02:41:50.640 --> 02:41:57.680
Yeah damn need some sunglasses to get up this tree. But yes the girls are definitely easing into

02:41:57.680 --> 02:42:03.920
the concept that because I assume you know they've consumed enough kind of like oh most

02:42:03.920 --> 02:42:08.160
future agencies like have this long list of rules that you have to abide by and it's like my rules

02:42:08.160 --> 02:42:18.720
are like literally you know be cool with lollipop stuff and no no male collabs and you know that's

02:42:18.720 --> 02:42:22.480
it. It gets really simple you do everything yourself I'm not going to tell you what to do I'm

02:42:22.720 --> 02:42:28.640
going to dictate your content. So Brian. Yes you can post whatever you want my dear mercy

02:42:28.640 --> 02:42:35.520
leaks classified military documents war thunder style. I know about that if you didn't know

02:42:36.240 --> 02:42:42.720
military documents keep getting leaked in a video game because people are like they're like so

02:42:42.720 --> 02:42:46.320
like wanting everything to be correct which is hilarious thank you for the tip Farah.

02:42:47.040 --> 02:42:55.760
But that's like true real and true because what I'm sure one of them was like they were arguing

02:42:55.760 --> 02:43:02.400
over a helicopter detailed design either in the cockpit or something to do with a helicopter

02:43:03.040 --> 02:43:09.680
and then someone was like so Tismo they were like no you're wrong and here's why and then they just

02:43:09.680 --> 02:43:17.200
like flop down these like documents that shouldn't be publicly accessible um and it's happened

02:43:17.200 --> 02:43:25.680
with the law. Okay we're singing a second song I'm going to assume by the third song we will progress

02:43:25.680 --> 02:43:33.120
to the next story part element is good good let me try a rumble nun will soon be found

02:43:33.120 --> 02:43:40.080
okay it's a little weird daily so many stuff challenger tank manlet armor but it

02:43:41.280 --> 02:43:47.360
in a Eurocopter shells etc it's happened 15 to 17 times

02:43:51.520 --> 02:43:56.480
bro bro was like slams on desk see I told you so

02:43:57.200 --> 02:44:03.680
now this gen is blessed truly guide you to your next like it wasn't even one country leaking

02:44:03.680 --> 02:44:09.280
the info it was all of them together just so that the the equipment and tanks and all that were

02:44:09.280 --> 02:44:14.000
accurate in game the next song there's literally a joke zero days since last military leak

02:44:14.960 --> 02:44:21.040
she sees what you may become they don't like to be wrong exactly great honor I'm just someone

02:44:21.040 --> 02:44:25.680
who gave me a song back home we call that a DJ oh he she just stroked his chest

02:44:26.400 --> 02:44:33.760
didn't you worry mate I just collect the songs look beyond the cup that's already full

02:44:34.640 --> 02:44:37.200
og san says as he drinks it means

02:44:38.960 --> 02:44:47.120
uh they are a Ramu a certain dominance honestly actually leaks really five and seven but other

02:44:47.120 --> 02:44:54.560
times they were export uh restricted but it could be found online I'm really proud to belong to the

02:44:54.560 --> 02:45:00.800
war thunder community for their dastardly arcs the forest burns our warriors flee before the humans

02:45:01.360 --> 02:45:09.200
these are drinking what hmm the rda must be gunning me and me I say actually all of them

02:45:09.200 --> 02:45:13.280
you know what well that's it all of them we can't escape the the p-corp jokes

02:45:13.280 --> 02:45:17.920
is the time to counter their attack or must be risked in times of need

02:45:19.920 --> 02:45:25.840
just all of them are at it honestly I mean if you think about it as there is milk heels

02:45:26.560 --> 02:45:34.160
so what would the other liquids do I don't know I don't know we didn't lure that that wasn't

02:45:34.160 --> 02:45:42.080
concepted but up to you what you think the other ones do uh what is this area I seem to have

02:45:42.160 --> 02:45:48.480
forgotten this map I actually don't remember it the warriors here know the land uh the obligatory

02:45:48.480 --> 02:45:53.840
okay please be the last song because no more song missions please see if they can find big b we could

02:45:53.840 --> 02:45:58.480
use this big b all right just marry big b this much at this point I feel love them so much

02:45:59.440 --> 02:46:06.640
he enjoys crushing skulls of many tortu tortu or humans when you have all I want to have squid

02:46:06.640 --> 02:46:14.080
ink spaghetti is that because of me be honest time to find out hey oh strony you didn't have shebe

02:46:14.080 --> 02:46:20.000
you didn't hear shebe's discussion about oh no actually this is one thing that I'm actually

02:46:20.000 --> 02:46:27.200
genuinely a bit sad about because I stream so much I don't have time to watch everyone's streams

02:46:27.200 --> 02:46:35.600
and it ups it like it genuinely upsets me like um I raided into mercy yesterday and she was playing

02:46:35.600 --> 02:46:40.800
oh mario or whatever the name of the game is oh I've never seen it or played it before

02:46:42.080 --> 02:46:48.080
and um she was like yeah I've been quite adorably but I just feel bad that like I don't have time

02:46:48.080 --> 02:46:53.040
like just everything like when I popped into ac stream playing that puzzle game obviously

02:46:53.600 --> 02:46:59.520
shebe's live right now I have terrible news but I don't have shebe uh in my ear right now

02:46:59.520 --> 02:47:03.840
that you guys can't hear whilst I game and stream and talk at the same time it's just not possible

02:47:03.840 --> 02:47:12.320
for me I do not remember this map at all I'm like um let's go for it let's see what this maps all about

02:47:12.320 --> 02:47:28.320
then what is this is this a run through type of thing uh no this is a search what is going on

02:47:28.400 --> 02:47:30.480
whoa this is pretty

02:47:34.080 --> 02:47:41.600
what is going on I need to learn to do that protection spell more wait why did the area

02:47:41.600 --> 02:47:48.160
just moved wait so am I supposed to kill those in the area let's go let's see yeah it's kind of

02:47:48.160 --> 02:47:54.480
shame that all your streams are overlapping I will say one thing I did ask the girls to push

02:47:54.480 --> 02:48:00.240
on the first week to stream as much as possible however um some of them are going to settle into

02:48:00.240 --> 02:48:08.240
streaming um I literally said to them do not even dare stream every single day after this like you

02:48:08.240 --> 02:48:13.600
will be taking breaks that like I was I've lit and they can all vouch that I told them straight to

02:48:13.600 --> 02:48:19.360
their faces don't you dare stream every single day the only reason I can do it is because I don't

02:48:19.360 --> 02:48:25.440
experience burnout the only reason I would not stream is if I am on death's door I'm not even

02:48:25.440 --> 02:48:31.920
kidding um oh that horse is beating me up they're jumping me wait use the ultimate use the heal

02:48:31.920 --> 02:48:37.680
heal heal heal my goodness you're so so what am I supposed to do here stop

02:48:37.840 --> 02:48:39.840
oh

02:48:42.640 --> 02:48:46.240
I'm gonna need to take these um getting hurt by something um

02:48:49.760 --> 02:48:58.000
what am I getting hurt by I have no idea right wait why am I just to run around these sectors

02:48:58.000 --> 02:49:07.280
or just stop it oh there's more of them here I need to heal are you forcing them to take breaks

02:49:07.280 --> 02:49:13.120
I'm not gonna tell them not to stream because that's not my place to do that but I will be

02:49:13.920 --> 02:49:20.000
worried if as time goes on like I've noticed one of them are like non-stop streaming

02:49:22.320 --> 02:49:28.240
but I will always like take their like if they say they're fine I'm not gonna question it I'm not

02:49:28.240 --> 02:49:32.400
I'm absolutely not gonna question it if they want to stream they can stream but I would be a bit

02:49:32.480 --> 02:49:37.840
worried like hopefully you're not like overdone you're safe because when I do it it's fine but

02:49:37.840 --> 02:49:42.400
when others do it hold on a minute I'm getting worried I'm I'm turning in a mother mode like are

02:49:42.400 --> 02:49:46.320
you okay uh is there something I could help you with is there like a reason behind the scenes why

02:49:46.320 --> 02:49:51.360
you want to stream everything you know I just want to make sure you're okay baby okay you're my you're

02:49:51.360 --> 02:49:58.400
my wing you're my wing oh my goodness uh you literally just stopped me from doing that ultimate

02:49:59.200 --> 02:50:02.400
okay objective perfectly right okay we did it we did it

02:50:04.720 --> 02:50:10.720
take care of your daughters these uh unironically I've been getting nightmares about my daughters

02:50:11.280 --> 02:50:18.720
um I had a nightmare that I didn't redirect into one of them and then they wanted to leave

02:50:18.720 --> 02:50:23.520
violor because of that and I literally put in the message I was like am I real mummy now

02:50:23.760 --> 02:50:29.440
without her because I'm like I'm literally having nightmares like of like oh no something's not

02:50:29.440 --> 02:50:39.840
going right or like I've done something wrong are we babies here we go well like uh I managed to get

02:50:39.840 --> 02:50:46.560
streaming did no streaming detachment anxiety that's not the word is it oh wait am I supposed to go

02:50:46.560 --> 02:50:57.440
this way um separation anxiety from the reefing um that happened and I don't know if I'm gonna develop

02:50:57.440 --> 02:51:04.880
it again for a little bit uh plausible but it's happened with the girls where when I go to sleep

02:51:04.880 --> 02:51:09.600
I get so nervous for them and like I'm worried like something might happen to them and I'm not

02:51:09.600 --> 02:51:16.480
there to like help them through it or something um but yeah yesterday was weird going after

02:51:16.480 --> 02:51:20.080
the tulip remarks there was so much time in the day but the good news is I got a lot

02:51:20.080 --> 02:51:32.560
behind the scenes work done wait follow me uh I may or may not blast into that dialogue and I don't

02:51:32.560 --> 02:51:45.680
know I'm at his court her Mr. Horsey that was me twat wait what oh fucking spank you today what

02:51:45.680 --> 02:51:52.880
are you playing at protection where's the other guy I literally just saw him or did I just get

02:51:52.880 --> 02:51:57.680
them both in the goal I assume I'm gonna score in her too yeah okay this is like an escort mission

02:51:57.680 --> 02:52:06.640
about everything does she attack or does she not attack no she just stands there and lets me do

02:52:06.640 --> 02:52:13.600
everything all right and ask you have it and lazy bum lazy bum lazy bum that's right I'm calling

02:52:13.600 --> 02:52:17.600
you'll be a lazy bum what you're gonna do better oh I love that one hit like fly by

02:52:19.760 --> 02:52:25.760
I swear in those it wasn't thing in the movies no it definitely is not is she getting attacked

02:52:25.760 --> 02:52:26.560
no she's fine

02:52:30.160 --> 02:52:31.200
she is getting attacked

02:52:31.200 --> 02:52:35.200
can you get

02:52:38.720 --> 02:52:41.680
there

02:52:41.680 --> 02:52:46.320
right we can progress to the next one she's on a very caring mama honestly

02:52:46.960 --> 02:52:53.200
she's got worries I'm like I remember my mom telling me when she had me she used to be a deep

02:52:53.200 --> 02:52:59.280
sleeper but when I was born she became a late sleeper and I'm like I feel that because I've

02:52:59.280 --> 02:53:03.600
not had like a really good night's sleep since debut oh before debut I didn't even have a good

02:53:03.600 --> 02:53:10.720
sleep either and the yap is the best part also in general a really cute thing for now is that

02:53:11.520 --> 02:53:16.960
they are yapping a lot but not a bad way no I love when the girls yap honestly it's like so nice to

02:53:16.960 --> 02:53:22.320
listen to like their stories and and the situations have been in they've been in like quite humorous

02:53:22.320 --> 02:53:31.120
situations um and it's just like fun to hear different people talk from like different walks

02:53:31.120 --> 02:53:38.560
of life like I know that sounds so freaking weird to say but like um it's just fascinating it just

02:53:39.200 --> 02:53:43.360
I don't know I just I just find it fascinating I feel like you can also learn a lot from people's

02:53:43.360 --> 02:53:49.040
stories as well even if it's a humorous story normally there's some sort of like thing or

02:53:49.040 --> 02:53:53.680
element where they can look back and giggle and be like oh I wouldn't have done that no but like

02:53:53.680 --> 02:53:58.640
oh wasn't it funny at the time and like you know just little good things I should maybe do a

02:53:58.640 --> 02:54:04.400
reefling story time where we share stories and it'll be like sure like I would be have to be like a

02:54:04.400 --> 02:54:12.800
google submission thing and it's like oh share your um share like a memory that makes you embarrassed

02:54:12.800 --> 02:54:18.480
and like I'll read them out and then I'll share you an embarrassing story of mine um like that

02:54:18.480 --> 02:54:22.320
kind of stuff I would absolutely love to do I feel like those kind of interactive streams are

02:54:22.320 --> 02:54:26.400
quite funny and we can all like kind of have a wee giggle at each other also you guys must

02:54:26.400 --> 02:54:32.000
remind me to brush my teeth at the end of the stream I keep forgetting to brush my teeth

02:54:32.880 --> 02:54:42.480
for that guy and um we need to do it together for 21 days so we can establish uh our beautiful

02:54:42.560 --> 02:54:45.200
training uh yes

02:54:47.360 --> 02:54:56.080
hello rocks village behind village the shards are behind honestly me speaking french rocks behind

02:54:56.880 --> 02:55:00.400
go got it I don't I've forgotten what behind is derriere

02:55:02.320 --> 02:55:08.640
village derriereville and then rock is probably just like l rock

02:55:13.520 --> 02:55:15.920
I think there's not a will stand below

02:55:16.240 --> 02:55:28.560
or is this a fate is this a fate oh it's a fate it's on peer protection I'm literally a warlock

02:55:28.560 --> 02:55:40.400
peer protection oh we don't like fire fire bad oh get raked get raked get raked I'm getting raked

02:55:40.400 --> 02:55:45.600
I'm getting raked by the I leveled up though but I'm currently getting absolutely you can

02:55:45.600 --> 02:55:51.120
literally see the ammo shot that is coming from me from that freaking thing oh unlock new armor

02:55:51.120 --> 02:55:59.920
whoa I'm naked is that less protection oh no it's the exact same oh if it's the same as the green

02:55:59.920 --> 02:56:10.240
one yeah we'll just use it um oh my god am I through your reload or something geez get me out

02:56:10.240 --> 02:56:14.640
of here I'm just gonna run ahead oh I haven't in this as well right we'll do in this

02:56:18.080 --> 02:56:19.920
try to speak as I say so it's not so

02:56:20.960 --> 02:56:25.280
literally I was green a minute ago with my armor and then it all disappeared and I'm like excuse me

02:56:25.280 --> 02:56:29.920
where's my uh protection via armor like you're telling me the navies still haven't figured out

02:56:29.920 --> 02:56:34.800
that uh maybe we should literally have bullets or getting thrown and you're telling me the

02:56:34.800 --> 02:56:41.280
navie haven't figured out that we should probably there is much they say you can do uh I can do

02:56:41.280 --> 02:56:46.720
a shard nearby I'm going to drink a water you should think about hygiene near the east village

02:56:46.720 --> 02:56:50.800
you must help we were attacked by humans many have died

02:56:53.520 --> 02:57:02.000
you are not too late go find Alona when he can help and Mercy says uh I'm sorry I've accidentally

02:57:02.000 --> 02:57:05.760
stumbled into the algorithm on Twitter and I'm like congrats because I don't know how the heck it

02:57:05.760 --> 02:57:12.640
works either uh and a lot has been used to find all low new in in the village of to the east

02:57:12.640 --> 02:57:21.040
the red feathers look pretty bad uh where are we going oh a bit of a bit of a walk oh no no

02:57:21.040 --> 02:57:29.520
not a bit of a walk well because there's a horsey horsey easy bear would you let me read you and

02:57:29.520 --> 02:57:35.600
say easy there like this dire horse from the hit video game James Cameron's avatar released in

02:57:36.000 --> 02:57:37.920
2009 um

02:57:41.360 --> 02:57:46.080
how many resurrections do I have I've actually not been collecting much samples does that attack me

02:57:46.080 --> 02:57:55.680
are you friendly oh well that got answered real quick didn't it whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa

02:57:55.680 --> 02:58:02.720
whoa whoa whoa whoa a bit too much action on these roads for me a bit too much not only I would

02:58:02.720 --> 02:58:09.360
say my only complaint about this game is that you can never freely explore the land like things

02:58:09.360 --> 02:58:14.000
constantly keep respawning which I'm not a fan of I quite like the idea of like clearing out an area

02:58:14.000 --> 02:58:18.960
and then it's like safe every time you like want to come back we're gonna unlock the tree of vision

02:58:21.280 --> 02:58:29.440
this game well this game did become PlayStation Platinum um uh apparently there's a multiplayer

02:58:29.520 --> 02:58:36.880
mode in this game I don't ever recall playing that as a child so it's running when is the history

02:58:36.880 --> 02:58:44.160
stream of yapping about the Irish potato family I was gonna do a teachers day where we have like

02:58:44.160 --> 02:58:50.640
40 minute or well maybe 30 minute classes so we do like English study and then we do like a French

02:58:50.640 --> 02:58:57.200
class and then we'll do like a PE class and we're like literally I'll just instruct you on what we're

02:58:57.200 --> 02:59:05.200
supposed to do and you'll just hear me jump up and down in my room um um what other we'll do mass

02:59:05.200 --> 02:59:13.120
as well I'll teach board mass is how we do it in the UK or maybe maybe just Scotland I don't know

02:59:13.120 --> 02:59:19.040
uh board masses brackets of division multiplication addition subtraction is different what the heck

02:59:19.040 --> 02:59:24.240
am I supposed to do I wasn't paying attention I think I'm supposed to collect things in this area

02:59:24.240 --> 02:59:29.120
yes I am I am to collect things in this area if that's the case in viz right now

02:59:30.640 --> 02:59:35.520
right we'll just do the outskirts of the area because I think that kind of highlights what the

02:59:35.520 --> 02:59:47.280
daily was where the heck over oh there is right there's one I can hear lots of enemies but I'm

02:59:47.280 --> 02:59:55.600
trying not to engage in any of them I am gonna get him to not attack me by doing this nope that

02:59:55.600 --> 03:00:02.480
was not that wasn't it oopsies literally just aggro time on me for no reason oh there is we need one

03:00:02.480 --> 03:00:17.040
more pink tentacle oh there is there is right we're safe safe safe safe safe we're gonna try and

03:00:17.040 --> 03:00:21.760
avoid all the fights because you really do once you do like if you engage in all the fights you

03:00:21.760 --> 03:00:27.360
really do get like tangled up and all this time strongy teaching man and it's not gonna go well

03:00:27.360 --> 03:00:31.840
but like we would do all the most basic covers like we do biology we'll do physics we'll do

03:00:31.840 --> 03:00:37.280
chemistry and like a full day and the way I was gonna do it is we're not allowed to progress

03:00:37.280 --> 03:00:42.400
until you guys actually give me the correct answer so depending on how fast you do it we'll get through

03:00:42.400 --> 03:00:47.120
the school day like really fast but like I'll put a little I don't know if I can get like a teacher

03:00:48.160 --> 03:00:55.040
I don't know maybe put like a graduation cap oh wait hold on I just realized I'm not gonna light

03:00:55.200 --> 03:01:00.340
on that's why my mouth tracking has been all funny hold on hold on professional streamer moment

03:01:07.040 --> 03:01:11.600
I'm gonna recalibrate just because I keep seeing my mouth is wiggling away I assure you I'm not

03:01:11.600 --> 03:01:15.600
about to cry you know when someone's about to cry then their mouth starts wiggling that's what I do

03:01:15.600 --> 03:01:23.500
anyway but we will recalibrate a little tricky a recalibration nope and my

03:01:23.500 --> 03:01:28.280
blanket is currently trapped around the microphone that's not fair Mr. Blanket

03:01:28.280 --> 03:01:34.600
please please work with me here your math phobia I hope you have a math

03:01:34.600 --> 03:01:41.040
phobia numbers oh so I was calibrating so I had to go in the dead silence

03:01:41.040 --> 03:01:47.600
what you scared the numbers oh multiplication oh yeah that terrify

03:01:47.600 --> 03:01:55.080
you that stuff made out of nightmares for you yeah where's these horses

03:01:59.440 --> 03:02:04.040
you could give a history lesson on the battle of bannock born I absolutely will

03:02:04.040 --> 03:02:11.160
we'll do we'll have a Scottish lessons stream a segment for it because if we're

03:02:11.160 --> 03:02:16.200
gonna study English later at your name I'm gonna stay off the horse for this I

03:02:16.200 --> 03:02:19.280
think I'm just picking these people up horse you're in my way thank you

03:02:19.280 --> 03:02:36.480
reunite the hunters well we'll just I'll just let them fight in the

03:02:36.480 --> 03:02:40.080
background whilst I'm in a cutscene don't worry guys you're doing fine keep up

03:02:40.080 --> 03:02:48.240
you know you're fine you're fine you're doing what's your favorite protest what

03:02:48.240 --> 03:02:54.080
does that mean what's a protest I don't know what I'll make sure alone a win

03:02:54.080 --> 03:02:57.280
knows you're coming oh my god a veiler group calibration with the math cuz

03:02:57.280 --> 03:03:01.880
apparently all of you struggle with math literally I like playing in the

03:03:01.880 --> 03:03:05.960
criminal games but you know I don't actually like doing the thinking part

03:03:05.960 --> 03:03:20.880
when it comes to numbers so yeah this is the way to victory to victory to

03:03:20.880 --> 03:03:29.080
victory this is the way to victory and this is a way we'll go I'm actually so

03:03:29.080 --> 03:03:34.240
fast on this is this faster than the Thanator actually might be you know oh

03:03:34.280 --> 03:03:38.760
there's so many samples around here I'm just gonna check oh I'm actually max on

03:03:38.760 --> 03:03:44.400
revives I've got five revives over getting ready to attack you have done

03:03:44.400 --> 03:03:50.040
much for my class yeah we stand beside you even she be was struggling with a

03:03:50.040 --> 03:03:57.400
puzzle puzzle games are mmm I asked Emmy and AC see if they would maybe

03:03:57.400 --> 03:04:03.760
collab on we were here that puzzle game and they had to swap the game they gave

03:04:03.800 --> 03:04:06.960
it a little shot like just as a five 15-minute practice and they were like

03:04:06.960 --> 03:04:09.400
we're not playing that and I was that's fine that's fine you don't have to play

03:04:09.400 --> 03:04:17.560
it's fine fine I wanted to see if I could do it with the refling but then I'd

03:04:17.560 --> 03:04:24.280
have to like if I could do it yeah they wonder the rock killed me it's sort of

03:04:24.280 --> 03:04:29.440
flipping entire boulder on my skull are you joking how is that supposed to know

03:04:29.440 --> 03:04:36.040
that was about time that's outrageous oh map design change what's in here

03:04:36.040 --> 03:04:42.920
enemies got a lot of oh can you guess really not see

03:04:46.440 --> 03:04:55.640
okay I give up I give up that's really annoying what's going on here I've done

03:04:55.640 --> 03:04:59.480
protection I've got knocked back I hate when they knock you back because that's

03:04:59.480 --> 03:05:05.160
when you can just absolutely eat all of the damage that they're laying out which

03:05:05.160 --> 03:05:14.480
is not good yeah like I'm literally getting so injured this your spawn point

03:05:14.480 --> 03:05:19.440
is it behind here you suck give me that spawn point get that spawn point out

03:05:19.440 --> 03:05:25.200
here oh we're just like literally going back

03:05:28.720 --> 03:05:34.880
could you do a lesson on Mary Kunis cause honestly oh my god I have to make you

03:05:34.880 --> 03:05:41.000
do force the force Pete are you religious education as well actually

03:05:41.000 --> 03:05:46.800
maybe not I may not be that fun for people I'll make us sing a song though

03:05:46.800 --> 03:05:59.440
a little don't carry anything down the dusty road something like that force choir

03:05:59.440 --> 03:06:03.480
I'll have to get us all to sing at the same time but it has to be it has to be

03:06:03.480 --> 03:06:09.360
like internet culture songs because why are we why did why did he just oh there's

03:06:09.360 --> 03:06:16.160
a dog there but a dog dog with a book and I don't know what songs I could make

03:06:16.320 --> 03:06:23.040
sing it would have to be related to meme culture what did you guys think about all

03:06:23.040 --> 03:06:33.200
the songs that made the girls sing I freaking how am I supposed to avoid that

03:06:33.200 --> 03:06:37.280
I'm sorry there's absolutely no way you can dodge that unless you went to attack

03:06:37.360 --> 03:06:40.000
but if you am I am I going the wrong way

03:06:44.400 --> 03:06:49.520
I've gone horrifically the wrong way sorry I had to like really think there I think I'm

03:06:49.520 --> 03:06:56.800
actually about to lose my dire horse coming back here because of this car yeah wow literally

03:06:57.680 --> 03:07:03.360
Brian what if the game show with the girls where every stream the questions are about a

03:07:03.360 --> 03:07:10.480
different subject eyes hold on I'm getting absolutely right hold on protection in viz

03:07:10.480 --> 03:07:16.640
let's go oh and viz sorry right hold on narrow thank you for the tip hey shroney what if

03:07:16.640 --> 03:07:21.120
veal or game show with the girls where every stream the questions are about a different

03:07:21.120 --> 03:07:27.200
I'm sorry I can't do two things at once hold on hold on what way did I go stick to this one

03:07:28.160 --> 03:07:33.680
oh oh oh I'm no I'm no I'm no smart enough to do two things at once I'm gonna have to read

03:07:33.680 --> 03:07:40.160
that all over again one more time take it from the top hey strong why is there more enemies

03:07:40.160 --> 03:07:44.000
what if veal or game show with the girls where they stream the question there are different

03:07:44.000 --> 03:07:49.840
there the great questions are every so we do have one game show coming up that I'm gonna make

03:07:49.840 --> 03:08:00.160
I am going to reach out to a creator for possibly they already do a game show but I was gonna set

03:08:00.160 --> 03:08:06.400
it up for them so literally they can just rack in all the money if you didn't know the easiest way

03:08:06.400 --> 03:08:12.240
to collab with people is to do all the work but let them like take over type thing it's the most

03:08:13.360 --> 03:08:19.520
likely way that a collab opportunities will be accepted so I've got possibly a game show

03:08:19.760 --> 03:08:25.760
we're going to show up on someone else's channel and and then I'll get like a highlight reel made

03:08:26.560 --> 03:08:32.640
and so I need to reach out to another creator but I'm letting this first week settle down like

03:08:32.640 --> 03:08:36.960
it's been a bit hectic like trying to get a script manager in place and we're trying to

03:08:36.960 --> 03:08:43.120
deal with this clipping issue that we've kind of right now things are a bit slow to be produced

03:08:43.120 --> 03:08:47.840
but the girls are going to have shorts that come out consistently on their channels at some point

03:08:50.400 --> 03:08:58.480
but like me and she be are literally lagging for shorts because I'm waiting to get us monetized

03:08:58.480 --> 03:09:04.400
first before we start putting shorts out because this is just a fact but shorts do better if

03:09:04.400 --> 03:09:12.480
there's something in them that's a bit humorous in that way and the one that I got a she be to do

03:09:12.480 --> 03:09:18.560
that a fauna speedrun challenge like that did well and all and I actually really she got to show

03:09:18.560 --> 03:09:28.400
off her mine like voice which is absolutely perfect but the other ones I actually got her to discuss

03:09:31.600 --> 03:09:38.880
milk body type v-tubers which I thought was super interesting but I'm too scared to put it up

03:09:39.600 --> 03:09:45.920
right now because I would be mortified if the girls didn't get accepted for monetization

03:09:46.880 --> 03:09:54.640
and this recent ASMR stuff geez I'm literally getting grenade launched my goodness draw destroy

03:09:54.640 --> 03:10:02.080
the amp soup well okay I'm gonna say where is it um but there will be a lot of shorts coming up

03:10:02.080 --> 03:10:11.280
like one monetization is freaking dealt with uh because the stats updated but it only updated

03:10:11.360 --> 03:10:17.760
halfway through debut so it says I still haven't reached watch hours even though I think I have

03:10:17.760 --> 03:10:24.320
like a stupendous amount of watch hours now especially after that assassins creed my assassins

03:10:24.320 --> 03:10:31.200
creed brother you'd stream almost has more views than my debut stream which is hilarious to think

03:10:31.200 --> 03:10:35.600
about because I streamed for so long and I guess people just didn't expect it so like they came

03:10:35.600 --> 03:10:43.520
back in the stream twice at some point you made 20 hours in two days literally like but after

03:10:43.520 --> 03:10:48.480
debut we all successfully had enough watch time at that point it's just youtube has taken an entire

03:10:48.480 --> 03:10:54.160
week to update and today I was supposed to be able to apply everyone's channel for monetization

03:10:54.160 --> 03:11:04.560
but it only partially updated the thing I think it's faster if I jump no just jump down on this

03:11:04.560 --> 03:11:11.040
bridge that comes up um but I only did it halfway through debut so I need to wait another 24 hours

03:11:11.040 --> 03:11:18.880
for it to update and then I can submit all the girls channels um like I've got an ASMR short

03:11:18.880 --> 03:11:28.000
of sheebie as well but Azura's short got denied for monetization for advertisement and I think it's

03:11:28.000 --> 03:11:34.720
literally because her voice is just too strong like I don't know how but her her voice is too

03:11:34.720 --> 03:11:39.920
strong it needs nerve oh I really don't want to go down if that's there can I destroy this

03:11:42.160 --> 03:11:46.080
hold on did I just snipe him out of that car

03:11:49.360 --> 03:11:55.520
did that car just disappear I'm just gonna invis through this section but that looks like

03:11:55.520 --> 03:12:04.240
I sniked him out that car no I clearly didn't because he's right there you don't hear anything

03:12:04.240 --> 03:12:10.400
that's called the AI cheating what's this a bomb ooh a bomb

03:12:13.440 --> 03:12:19.680
ooh a bomb whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa there's far too many of you right now there's far too many

03:12:19.760 --> 03:12:26.080
of you right now oh my gosh oh my gosh I've done it now I've done it now I've done it now I've done

03:12:26.080 --> 03:12:33.200
now commit commit commit commit submit conceptguitar where's the one where's the one just one more in

03:12:33.200 --> 03:12:38.400
here there is a siya siya siya siya we can do this we can do this as long as I do I do it

03:12:38.400 --> 03:12:43.840
I'll hit checkpoint right get me that head out here ooh I don't have heal yet I don't have

03:12:43.840 --> 03:12:51.720
I have heal, I have heal, I have heal, I have heal, I have heal, I have heal, I have heal.

03:12:51.720 --> 03:12:52.720
What's going on?

03:12:52.720 --> 03:12:53.720
Why?

03:12:53.720 --> 03:12:58.320
Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, get on the horse, get on the horse, get on the horse,

03:12:58.320 --> 03:12:59.320
get on the horse.

03:12:59.320 --> 03:13:02.320
Am I on the wrong side?

03:13:02.320 --> 03:13:07.320
If I go this way, I can teleport to that other one and then go from there.

03:13:07.320 --> 03:13:08.800
Yes, we will do that.

03:13:08.800 --> 03:13:10.800
Oh no, there's another one of these.

03:13:10.800 --> 03:13:13.320
Oh my gosh, they're so pee.

03:13:13.320 --> 03:13:17.160
Goodness gravy.

03:13:17.160 --> 03:13:19.280
What does that even mean?

03:13:19.280 --> 03:13:26.720
How, literally, I think it's because very sadly sheepsters in Azura might have a cover

03:13:26.720 --> 03:13:37.000
up for their, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know what's going on, we're kind of,

03:13:37.000 --> 03:13:41.960
we're at the question mark stage of what's the problem, what's the issue, but we'll

03:13:41.960 --> 03:13:43.360
get there, okay.

03:13:43.360 --> 03:13:46.480
Did I say thank you for the tip, Nero?

03:13:46.480 --> 03:13:47.480
Sorry if I didn't.

03:13:47.480 --> 03:13:54.640
But yes, there are game show type-esque things coming up, there's no horse games.

03:13:54.640 --> 03:13:59.320
November is my Scottish game show, I don't know if one of the girls might be interested

03:13:59.320 --> 03:14:11.160
in holding a type of VTuber collab game show, I'll need to see, mate, I was actually helping

03:14:11.480 --> 03:14:12.480
you, do you mind?

03:14:12.480 --> 03:14:15.480
Jeez, you're so rude and stinky.

03:14:15.480 --> 03:14:21.720
Alright, I think I'm to go this way and then, I'm sorry, I'm getting really switched around

03:14:21.720 --> 03:14:26.920
with this freaking map, but we'll just, we'll go for it, we'll send it.

03:14:26.920 --> 03:14:34.640
Ooh, no thank you, no thank you, no thank you, hehehe, not interested, no thank you.

03:14:34.640 --> 03:14:40.680
Your horses butt is soaking up all those bullets like a cha- honestly, stagger an amount of

03:14:40.680 --> 03:14:44.360
endurance on that thing.

03:14:44.360 --> 03:14:51.640
The Easter wheels, oh, are they finally giving me a path with no enemies?

03:14:51.640 --> 03:14:55.960
You know what, I'm not speaking ever again, that's a ridiculous timing, you've embarrassed

03:14:55.960 --> 03:14:58.280
me.

03:14:58.280 --> 03:15:02.240
I would, I think that's my only complaint about this game, it would be so nice if there

03:15:02.240 --> 03:15:06.400
was areas that you could just enjoy for the beauty, which I know this sounds like such

03:15:06.400 --> 03:15:10.920
a weird thing to say, but like, I really, I like admiring the game, okay?

03:15:10.920 --> 03:15:16.280
I'm a little, a little map design admirer and like look at how much nature there is.

03:15:16.280 --> 03:15:20.160
I'm pretty sure there's actually a steam game that came out and it's all about identifying

03:15:20.160 --> 03:15:25.440
plants in nature and I'm like, honestly, I wish I was like more entertaining so I could

03:15:25.440 --> 03:15:29.640
play it, but I'm not that entertaining, B or B, I gotta go somewhere, okay let me just

03:15:29.640 --> 03:15:35.960
pause the stream, we'll wait for you to come back, see you when you come back.

03:15:36.960 --> 03:15:50.720
Oh, it's not Osha, is it Peeta, P-E-T-A, Peeta, that's that animal organisation, Peeta,

03:15:50.720 --> 03:15:55.640
Peeta, that's not working in my head, I don't think it's Peeta.

03:15:55.640 --> 03:16:02.400
Oh, new armour, oh, check that out, oh I like that, hold on, let's do a little wardrobe

03:16:02.400 --> 03:16:05.440
check, wardrobe check, oh wait, whoa.

03:16:05.440 --> 03:16:11.000
My mobility is way down, but my protection is so up from that, we might leave that up,

03:16:11.000 --> 03:16:19.800
I'd rather like have more indefinite protection than having to deal with all these issues,

03:16:19.800 --> 03:16:21.960
with constantly like getting barraged.

03:16:21.960 --> 03:16:32.640
Ah, right, okay, crystal, crystal, crystal, crystal, let's beat them up, where's the crystal?

03:16:33.360 --> 03:16:40.840
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, steady on, steady on, where's the crystal, I'm like literally

03:16:40.840 --> 03:16:49.600
jump-scaring these guys, whoa, you were on the crystal, alright, where is it, am I staring

03:16:49.600 --> 03:16:55.640
at it, oh it's up, oh wow, okay, I wouldn't have known that, it's like I was on that

03:16:55.640 --> 03:17:05.680
crystal there, mission complete, wee, ow, my ankles, no again, protection is more important,

03:17:05.680 --> 03:17:15.960
the mobility, I would say so yeah, that's a big old horse ride, um, can I, wait is that,

03:17:15.960 --> 03:17:22.240
that is done, uh-huh, uh-huh, yeah, yeah, just reading them up, yeah, I don't know where

03:17:22.320 --> 03:17:26.240
to go, I don't know where to go, I don't know, really turned around, I think it would be

03:17:26.240 --> 03:17:40.160
faster if I took a teleport near this location, um, hello, uh, I have to redo the set, alright,

03:17:40.160 --> 03:17:48.760
okay, no, I just fell through the map, okay, classic open, but there we go, I think we're

03:17:48.800 --> 03:17:54.040
actually getting pretty close, I have never done that before, I guess this game, I mean

03:17:54.040 --> 03:18:00.920
I did say that games have problems with vertical stuff, especially older games, when it comes

03:18:00.920 --> 03:18:07.360
to mapping you just fall through the map so many times in older games, right, we're gonna

03:18:07.360 --> 03:18:17.360
teleport where, it looks like that and then just take a weird straight ahead, what a strange

03:18:17.480 --> 03:18:27.280
layout for a map, a skill issue honestly, childhood me would never do that, and yet here we are

03:18:27.280 --> 03:18:37.000
being an even worse gamer, pardon me, I'm doing this with baby birds this time, I saw the

03:18:37.000 --> 03:18:46.600
truck, I saw it, wait I need to claim this, I don't know, oh my, I don't know if I'm,

03:18:46.720 --> 03:18:51.640
can I get away with this, oh my god I can get away with it, oh, oh that poor horse I've

03:18:51.640 --> 03:18:56.040
just left it, I'm so sorry you get to meet Ewa now, hush hush, your plight is over, you

03:18:56.040 --> 03:19:03.200
no longer have to, you can frolic in the fields in Ewa's heaven now, if I've just left you,

03:19:03.200 --> 03:19:13.440
to perish to the RDA, ooh, I would make the joke but I don't have any more sound effects,

03:19:13.480 --> 03:19:18.600
magic your way to the other side of the map honestly, a bit cheeky to claim when there's an

03:19:18.600 --> 03:19:24.880
entire tank shooting at you, you're the best gamer I am especially when you rage, oh no, I

03:19:24.880 --> 03:19:30.720
always feel bad when I rage because I feel like it's like, I like doing what I like to see and if

03:19:30.720 --> 03:19:35.840
I see like a streamer rage I'm like, I'm not sure I'm finding this entertaining but if you guys

03:19:35.840 --> 03:19:43.320
like it then sure I'll tap into my ancestors rage, I'm literally the, is it the orcs and

03:19:43.400 --> 03:19:51.400
Skyrim, I think their special move is called Ancestral's Rage and it's like 10% more, or

03:19:51.400 --> 03:19:58.240
Berserk type thing, it's like 10% more damage, what's going on here, the last song, right,

03:19:58.240 --> 03:20:04.120
look for the thumping when bumping, nope, there's a fight, why is there a fight, I thought I just

03:20:04.120 --> 03:20:11.640
had to interact with the tree, did I not have to interact with the tree, oh, okay, okay, okay,

03:20:11.800 --> 03:20:15.000
we're doing it, we're doing it, we're doing it, we're doing it, come on, let's do it before

03:20:15.000 --> 03:20:21.160
they destroy absolutely everything, is it not here, triangle, hello triangle, looking for a

03:20:21.160 --> 03:20:27.960
triangle, triangle, this is a triangle, there we go, are they going to blow the tree up before

03:20:27.960 --> 03:20:34.200
I get the phone, no the Ancestral stuff was done more, Berserkers rage is the one that works out,

03:20:34.520 --> 03:20:41.800
ah, right, invisible because we're not out here trying to have a billion battles every two seconds,

03:20:43.160 --> 03:20:47.640
yeah, probably feedback on the game, kind of calm down on how many enemies you put on the map

03:20:47.640 --> 03:20:54.680
because they are constant, hello barrier, did this, did this game really say go around,

03:20:56.200 --> 03:21:02.600
no way this game just said go around, oh no it's fine, it's fine, it's fine, it's fine,

03:21:04.600 --> 03:21:10.440
yes, yes, let's get out of here, this place is gonna blow, oh, we must return to Kellotron,

03:21:10.440 --> 03:21:17.160
take your ecran, we ride to home tree, okay, we go to home tree, home tree,

03:21:23.400 --> 03:21:27.400
I think we're getting there, I can't really recall how much more to the campaign there is,

03:21:27.800 --> 03:21:33.480
this would be three songs and if we're playing the classic video game rule,

03:21:37.800 --> 03:21:43.800
I can't remember what comes after the third song, I swear if it's like go for another song on my

03:21:43.800 --> 03:21:50.120
right, wrap it up, wrap it up, wrap it up, you're taking a bit too long now, take a bit too long,

03:21:50.120 --> 03:21:53.720
we're gonna need to do something a bit more than home questing, but look how cool that armor looks

03:21:53.720 --> 03:21:59.800
honestly, that's pretty thick, it would be so cool to see this game remastered,

03:21:59.800 --> 03:22:06.440
but I do not think it sold well, I think it hardly did it, it's numeros, hello,

03:22:09.320 --> 03:22:17.080
we love them, James Cameron you did it again, is it snowing, no,

03:22:17.080 --> 03:22:20.360
let's hope we're getting close, we don't find it soon, this whole planet's gonna

03:22:20.360 --> 03:22:27.480
fly, winter in Australia is just fake, it never goes below freezing,

03:22:30.440 --> 03:22:34.040
yes yes the song, the song, ay was song, please be the last song, no more singing,

03:22:34.280 --> 03:22:38.520
ah ah ah ah ah,

03:22:42.200 --> 03:22:46.840
tells where it is, please, no more songs, surely we know what's up,

03:22:46.840 --> 03:22:54.680
many of the people believe in you yet some fear the tattooed spirit inside you let me get

03:22:54.680 --> 03:22:59.800
fedama he blames you for much there was just a whole missing voice line i think

03:23:01.560 --> 03:23:10.200
it was so hard to come to our realization that christmas is summer final song it's not natural

03:23:10.920 --> 03:23:18.280
but it's a pretty decided once i wrap up a business that i am going back to

03:23:22.760 --> 03:23:27.880
yeah if you ever went to open up a business in the uk don't you better do it in australia

03:23:27.880 --> 03:23:30.280
but then go back to the uk once you're done with all your business

03:23:30.760 --> 03:23:34.840
yeah here for more entrepreneur tips

tanjala wants you to fly to a new location i don't know what this

03:23:50.920 --> 03:23:54.520
i'm afraid my memory is getting very easy now for the game

03:23:54.920 --> 03:24:03.560
you'd kill for a warm christmas it is bizarre i did not enjoy it like i phoned my family

03:24:04.520 --> 03:24:14.440
and i was like oh i wish it was cold i wish it was cold um because you do get snowy christmas

03:24:14.440 --> 03:24:19.320
in scotland which is really pretty when it does happen when the stars align it's very nice

03:24:20.120 --> 03:24:25.800
hello hello i haven't given up where is the shot

03:24:27.560 --> 03:24:33.560
where sky machine has crushed you are so mean i've literally been helping you for ages

03:24:34.280 --> 03:24:37.800
i'm sorry but i think enough time to pass where he should be all right with me

03:24:37.800 --> 03:24:44.920
and you're giving me any nonsense you make it sound so mystical it's very beautiful

03:24:44.920 --> 03:24:49.080
where the what the heck is this map i do not recall at all

03:24:51.320 --> 03:24:55.960
memories getting a little bit easy i can't see where the map ends because of that very

03:24:55.960 --> 03:25:02.920
top right corner very clearly that's where this map location ends but i don't know what happens here

03:25:05.080 --> 03:25:11.320
i can't believe it right i think we're just gonna leg it as we always do

03:25:11.320 --> 03:25:18.360
but yeah like these look the map details like the kind of the further you progress the more

03:25:18.360 --> 03:25:26.040
damage the areas are and you know it was trying our hardest but like there's only only so much

03:25:26.040 --> 03:25:32.440
awa can do and the navi can do against literal bullets i have to admit bows versus bullets

03:25:32.440 --> 03:25:37.640
like i'd rather have the rather have the mp5 or the famine so my wait why did i get off i just

03:25:37.720 --> 03:25:42.200
want to activate that oh well i needed to get off anyway because i need to cut up in this fence

03:25:42.200 --> 03:25:47.960
i'm itching my little whoa is this elden ring oh you've got this right let's see

03:25:50.600 --> 03:25:57.160
uh we'll just avoid thank you for spawning in but not really interested me wait am i going

03:25:57.160 --> 03:26:04.360
the wrong way no i can go this way i just happened to walk right into an rda uh aligned and i need

03:26:04.360 --> 03:26:10.600
to cut this fence as well goodness gravy i might make a cup of tea shortly and go for a peep because

03:26:10.600 --> 03:26:17.400
we've actually not peeped in three and a half hours of uh unless some of you guys have a detached

03:26:17.400 --> 03:26:25.800
headset and then you go for a peep whilst whilst still listening to oh the fact that there's a

03:26:25.800 --> 03:26:31.880
very high chance that a reefling has dropped a loaf of bread while listening to me ramble on stream

03:26:31.880 --> 03:26:38.200
that's right reefling i'm on air i know exactly what you're up to mm-hmm i know what's going on

03:26:41.480 --> 03:26:48.760
a drop a loaf of bread honestly drop apparently the there's another same which is a drop the

03:26:48.760 --> 03:26:58.680
kids off at the pool which is a guilty is charged oh no it's been confirmed you know when people

03:26:58.760 --> 03:27:02.360
say like oh what did you what what did you think would happen like when you became a

03:27:02.360 --> 03:27:08.440
vertebra etc uh apparently i didn't account for someone dropping a loaf of bread to my voice so

03:27:08.440 --> 03:27:15.480
there's that yeah um yeah quite a few unique scenarios definitely definitely

03:27:19.240 --> 03:27:24.280
how are you ever like he teleports around this map for fun i swear okay hello

03:27:24.520 --> 03:27:34.040
no the shard was blown up not sure not sure the first voice is not sure oh i'm being called

03:27:34.040 --> 03:27:37.400
the first voice i'm no longer dreamwalker oh my tummy rumbled if you heard that

03:27:38.680 --> 03:27:43.000
listen into your patreon audio we'll see in a man about horse

03:27:46.200 --> 03:27:50.680
i didn't want to miss the second of your beautiful voice though if it's any consolation

03:27:51.320 --> 03:27:57.160
you make dropping and you make dropping a loaf of bread hell a lot more comfortable you're done

03:27:57.160 --> 03:27:59.480
you're out out you're done

03:28:02.200 --> 03:28:09.480
we would be not identifying as loaf of bread droppers oh that came out nowhere

03:28:10.200 --> 03:28:16.520
oh my poor horse i should have picked up a new one

03:28:17.960 --> 03:28:22.120
because he's so low health i want him to retire and live a happy life

03:28:22.120 --> 03:28:25.240
but i don't think that's gonna is a left or right it's this way

03:28:33.800 --> 03:28:35.960
she knows too much hey yeah

03:28:36.360 --> 03:28:43.720
oh right i'm gonna pick up this horse here because i would like this one to literally

03:28:43.720 --> 03:28:49.400
retire and have a happy life excuse me mr. horsey see you go enjoy yourself and heal up and then

03:28:49.400 --> 03:28:50.840
i'm gonna have you

03:28:53.720 --> 03:28:58.760
and then everyone lived happily ever after and the and everyone around me clapped yay

03:28:59.160 --> 03:29:04.520
hey that's what we're supposed to listen to the first honestly though

03:29:06.200 --> 03:29:14.280
um wow that's a lot of power about a lot of manpower behind that

03:29:15.560 --> 03:29:19.640
they're destroying the crystals before we get them is someone telling them this

03:29:22.840 --> 03:29:24.680
how do they know where the heck all these crystals are

03:29:25.640 --> 03:29:32.280
right we'll finish this map and then we'll go for a tinkle and i will also go for a

03:29:32.280 --> 03:29:37.720
tinkle and make a cup of honey tea to help soothe my curve voice it's really bizarre

03:29:38.440 --> 03:29:45.320
my voice is so broken but the microphone makes it sound so like fine and not broke wait can i

03:29:45.320 --> 03:29:57.240
just teleport no um so i sound like pretty normal on stream my voice has been broken since uh the

03:29:58.360 --> 03:30:05.720
the violor exposed violor stream um i don't know thankfully i've managed to record a lot of

03:30:05.720 --> 03:30:13.000
stuff in advance but don't be surprised if you get a patreon audio and i'm just sound like a frog

03:30:13.000 --> 03:30:19.080
i'm like yeah you like that good boy and you're such a good wee boy and you like my toad boy like

03:30:19.080 --> 03:30:27.640
it's getting it's getting curious it's getting curious and you are a demon how is it you live

03:30:29.320 --> 03:30:35.240
honestly that's kind of a fair assumption there's something i gotta tell you we must have been

03:30:35.480 --> 03:30:45.560
those who have fallen do some patreon videos in full pantomime you get 3d models and start like

03:30:45.560 --> 03:30:55.080
mime in the axe yeah wouldn't be the first thing patreon looks and audio in me a little frog voice

03:30:55.080 --> 03:31:01.480
moment you let a horse die oh it was a mistake i can't save them all but i can try my best

03:31:02.280 --> 03:31:08.440
also i just want to say i am still getting marshmallows of people asking me to save

03:31:08.440 --> 03:31:13.960
each oh that horse literally just perished right before me oh where am i supposed to go

03:31:13.960 --> 03:31:17.800
uh that's quite far to go by foot but we don't really have a choice there's no more horsey

03:31:17.800 --> 03:31:29.240
boysy um skull horse skull women sound really cute when their voice is cracked and squeak

03:31:29.320 --> 03:31:36.200
from over use and they're giggling asking you to say what no they're they're asking me to save

03:31:37.080 --> 03:31:43.640
certain v-tubers and i said it on that stream the other day and like we're all having a giggle

03:31:43.640 --> 03:31:49.160
but i woke up and i got a few more and i'm like i don't i don't know if it's reef link sending it

03:31:49.160 --> 03:31:56.120
or whatever but like i'm gonna be on it oh it's full health again um i'm gonna be honest uh i hope

03:31:56.120 --> 03:32:01.320
it's understandable no i can't literally save all v-tubers you know i'll try my best to look

03:32:01.320 --> 03:32:08.120
after those who have faith in me um you know i'm a big believer in reciprocation in terms of you

03:32:08.120 --> 03:32:18.440
have faith in me i have faith in you type thing oh well i better not am i on a timer and i don't

03:32:18.440 --> 03:32:32.040
know it i think i'm on a timer gotta go gotta go gotta go i know i know i know i know i'm trying

03:32:34.440 --> 03:32:41.640
i can unlock this uh tree of vision you can leave from the front and try and change i think

03:32:42.200 --> 03:32:52.680
the content creator owned agencies definitely have a place um definitely have a place um

03:32:53.560 --> 03:33:00.360
because i think people are a bit it's not for me to say what the the overall feel is but i think

03:33:01.720 --> 03:33:07.560
for me anyway it was very disappointing to learn how little creators that sign up for

03:33:07.560 --> 03:33:13.640
these agencies get in exchange for all their hard work because did he just go ahead me powerful

03:33:13.640 --> 03:33:20.440
then a river did he just go ahead me um hello hello human resources do you guys have human

03:33:20.440 --> 03:33:29.960
resources on pandora because um what was that excuse me uh yeah because we have very specific

03:33:30.040 --> 03:33:37.560
unlikely but um i did actually learn about another agency that did have a higher split

03:33:37.560 --> 03:33:44.200
than the 5050 which i'm i'm quite happy to hear about um so i think hopefully over time that 5050

03:33:44.200 --> 03:33:50.200
split uh gets raised because i will tell you right now for however hard the girls work on

03:33:50.200 --> 03:33:55.000
stream it's absolutely nothing to do with me i don't tell them what to do they do it all themselves

03:33:55.000 --> 03:34:02.760
um and i believe that they should take home the lion's share that's just me but not every

03:34:03.320 --> 03:34:10.840
agency out there feels like that um but if you value um if you genuinely like as a special thank

03:34:10.840 --> 03:34:15.240
you is what wait hold on i'm getting absolutely annihilated here do i need to take these down i

03:34:15.240 --> 03:34:26.440
think so hold on i'm doing i cast protection what's going on here am i just to destroy

03:34:27.320 --> 03:34:34.440
because i'll do it ow we're on the same team right i don't have protection anymore but

03:34:34.440 --> 03:34:42.200
uh okay okay we're to just kill i can do that i can do that we but i'm a weapon

03:34:43.640 --> 03:34:47.800
what's this is this and can i not know uh

03:34:49.560 --> 03:34:54.920

the only the only problem is uh

03:35:37.880 --> 03:35:41.720

03:39:18.200 --> 03:39:22.040
i'd get a steaming with the navi not gonna lie i'd like ask them to carry me around on their backs

03:39:22.040 --> 03:39:31.480
and stuff he was we discord kitten honestly he's not a hater anymore literally he was just a bit

03:39:31.480 --> 03:39:36.680
stressed from all the war just a wee bit of war wee bit of war you know strong men more times you

03:39:36.680 --> 03:39:40.280
know how it goes you know everyone needs a bit of release if you know and then it's just what

03:39:40.280 --> 03:39:47.800
happens just what happens oh my god do you approve of me now you think the first thing the humans

03:39:47.800 --> 03:39:53.560
gave to the navi we're making friends with beer honestly oh here's a bit diazepam you just get

03:39:53.560 --> 03:40:00.520
hooked on that uh cause a little uh drug pandemic you know here we go

the humans gather do you have the final song oh wait are we at the end

03:40:13.480 --> 03:40:21.000
i think so something happened are we at the end of the game already i don't know why

03:40:24.200 --> 03:40:30.200
i'm like 19 percent sure if you look up how long does james Cameron's avatar take it said

03:40:30.200 --> 03:40:37.240
literally eight hours to understand now quickly um sing the final song oh but that's like such a

03:40:37.240 --> 03:40:46.440
short screen though i never thought this far ahead i thought it was gonna be like an eight hour day

03:40:48.280 --> 03:40:52.680
i suppose the only good side if it was a short stream i can work on my asmr then

03:40:52.680 --> 03:40:57.160
because i've got collapse with five other girls that i'm working on outside of yellow

03:41:00.760 --> 03:41:04.920
yeah you can always yeah uh yeah we can do some marshmallows after the game

oh i was like strapped in for a good long

03:43:04.600 --> 03:43:08.840
though i'll say one thing the only good thing if i do go offline earlier is i can read into

03:43:08.840 --> 03:43:13.320
another viewer member and i can get to work on those asmr scripts because their girls uh

03:43:24.440 --> 03:43:30.520
you can't give me money and ask for it because then i feel like i do have to do it partner it's still

03:44:08.840 --> 03:44:13.800
if we play the rda side but i get really scared because the rda side you're so small on the

03:44:13.800 --> 03:44:20.120
camera so small and the navi are so big and scary i can't promise i'm not going to be scared

03:44:20.120 --> 03:44:23.720
because i've never done it before i don't know what comes up but like with these ones like

03:45:34.920 --> 03:45:39.400

03:58:11.960 --> 03:58:17.000
might find yourself a little a little underwhelmed it may be a little lackluster but uh this one

03:58:17.640 --> 03:58:21.720
oh don't wait wait wait then you worry about it right then you worry about it you're all destroyed

03:58:21.720 --> 03:58:27.800

03:59:02.920 --> 03:59:09.800
to play this game uh that even knows about this game because one person said they played it earlier

03:59:09.800 --> 03:59:14.760
and then now you've said you played it so now all three of us who have ever played this game are now

03:59:14.760 --> 03:59:19.480
here because literally no one has played this game does anyone i wonder if there's a public

03:59:19.480 --> 03:59:25.000
record of how many copies were sold because i just feel like it's such a thing way too late for this

03:59:25.000 --> 03:59:31.960
stream but i'm also one of the two people i played yeah uh everyone thinks i'm playing the new avatar

03:59:31.960 --> 03:59:36.280
i think possibly i don't know actually i don't know what the new avatar games called because this

03:59:36.280 --> 03:59:41.800
one's called james cameron's avatar the game well we've got to say oh my god mansion armor to winzies

03:59:42.360 --> 03:59:50.200
go waits for me in the in the cavern okay to the cat to the cavern to the cavern or something's

03:59:50.200 --> 03:59:57.800
waiting for me waiting waiting waiting cavern right i'm about to go around okay i'm to go around my

03:59:57.800 --> 04:00:08.840
apologies this the game has an interest in story i like it basically you are human and then it turns

04:00:08.840 --> 04:00:17.640
out a war planned on you kind of i don't know it's really bizarre oh a scalp the perimeter comb that

04:00:17.640 --> 04:00:25.400
beach why is that phrase called comb a beach what's that you mean what does it mean what does it even

04:00:25.400 --> 04:00:31.720

04:00:40.040 --> 04:00:47.720
rda soldiers i'll take it i'll take it a couple paths yeah i assume when we play the rda side

04:00:47.720 --> 04:00:54.040
we're literally just playing the exact same maps but doing the opposite of the bad people

04:00:55.000 --> 04:01:01.400
and destroying everything wow i need prediction on right now i'm getting

04:01:01.960 --> 04:01:08.360
absolutely nailed them right now i don't want to use healing because i actually do a full health bar

04:01:08.360 --> 04:01:16.200
when i heal let's uh let's speed on speed on through okay this looks more navvy oriented

04:01:17.080 --> 04:01:22.520
four hours is it going to be another endurance stream i think so originally it wasn't but um

04:01:22.520 --> 04:01:28.520
um i got paid money to play the rda side and you guys are holding my hand through it because

04:01:28.520 --> 04:01:36.200

one for you one spank for you and one for you okay we just need to defend the village now

04:03:07.000 --> 04:03:14.440
without perishing which i can definitely i can hear someone getting hurt over here oh yeah

04:03:16.520 --> 04:03:19.720

04:04:39.800 --> 04:04:51.400
one two three four five ultimate yeah honestly that ultimate is actually pretty sad so i'm gonna

04:04:51.400 --> 04:04:56.520
heal because it's not gonna all heal when we're not around it because the enemies keep coming back

04:04:56.520 --> 04:05:08.200
so protection oh there's a mech over there i think oh it's out of bounds wow i just do this for now

04:05:09.800 --> 04:05:17.240
oh no no i won't somebody's getting me oh maybe not maybe not the navi are actually helping hold on

04:05:17.240 --> 04:05:22.520
ai that actually attacks the enemies that are around you hold on a minute this game's 2009 and

04:05:22.520 --> 04:05:28.040
you're telling me they nailed it here and then games afterwards it's my biggest like great

04:05:29.000 --> 04:05:35.000
with video game development if you have allies that can attack but they do not actually end the

04:05:35.000 --> 04:05:43.720
enemies looking at you lego franchise looking at you and they actually don't help at all i don't

04:05:43.720 --> 04:05:50.040
know if the newest lego star wars they actually do help her is she playing this because she genuinely

04:05:50.040 --> 04:05:57.880
likes it or is she as a warning to the rest of us avoid this it's my childhood game i do like the

04:05:57.880 --> 04:06:04.040

04:10:08.040 --> 04:10:11.480
we prepare a storm is in the sky

04:10:17.080 --> 04:10:24.680
we did it na vi na vi na vi we're the best we're the best better than the rest better than the rda

04:10:25.480 --> 04:10:27.880
let me take a little little drink too

04:10:31.080 --> 04:10:36.440
congrats on getting second please for na vi any percent lemo let me submit this stream for it why not

04:10:41.160 --> 04:10:47.480
another game down well uh we're gonna go for a tinkle winkle and i'm gonna make a honey tea

04:10:47.480 --> 04:10:57.160
because my voice box is dying and then we're gonna do the rda side so don't uh emmy i believe

04:10:57.160 --> 04:11:04.280
sheebie is playing class of 09 emmy bezu is doing an unlisted unarchived stream so please don't be

04:11:04.280 --> 04:11:08.280
afraid to go check that out because i'll still be here actually i don't know how long she's gonna go

04:11:08.280 --> 04:11:13.480
for that maybe i mean if it's four hours to do the rda side it is very rough on the voice to whisper

04:11:13.480 --> 04:11:22.520
for four hours so hopefully i know boo rda rda hate emmy is making pin pals do math oh no way

04:11:23.640 --> 04:11:26.840
i think to know if you play as a human you have multiple places where you can betray them

04:11:28.600 --> 04:11:32.840
hmm what is that like all the way up to the very end

04:11:34.840 --> 04:11:39.320
because wouldn't i wouldn't i just become a na vi at that point or am i still human

04:11:39.720 --> 04:11:46.280
you wouldn't i have to do the evil side now unfortunately

04:11:48.600 --> 04:11:54.840
i think i would ruin the run if i did it i beat the game already literally i think it's

04:11:54.840 --> 04:12:00.200
four hours for each side yeah there's emmy rda hate but gun and flamethrower fun though

04:12:00.200 --> 04:12:03.160
then every straight up ask you to switch like three four times oh do they

04:12:04.120 --> 04:12:06.280

guys have to hold my hands with the game because i am actually genuinely terrified to please swim

04:13:05.240 --> 04:13:09.080
in all the way through because camera angle is so freaking low to the ground and if i've got big

04:13:09.080 --> 04:13:14.760
navi running at me i'm actually gonna be scared so yes hopefully this doesn't work i really hope

04:25:55.000 --> 04:26:01.000
Oh, I'm having a stroke and not the good kind.

04:26:01.000 --> 04:26:05.000
Oh.

04:26:05.000 --> 04:26:09.000
Okay, to my next card.

04:26:09.000 --> 04:26:15.000
What do you call a man? No.

04:26:15.000 --> 04:26:18.000
It's so goofy.

04:26:18.000 --> 04:26:23.000
It's so goofy.

04:26:23.000 --> 04:26:27.000
Turning the stream into a dad pun stream, honestly.

04:26:27.000 --> 04:26:29.000
I love this bit.

04:26:29.000 --> 04:26:32.000
Well, when you guys do witty comments that I can repeat on stream,

04:26:32.000 --> 04:26:37.000
I'm literally stealing them and then doing that gag over and over again.

04:26:37.000 --> 04:26:39.000
I should be straight up to working.

04:26:39.000 --> 04:26:43.000
Okay, I have to go now. Bye-bye. Bye. Thank you for hanging.

04:26:43.000 --> 04:26:45.000
I don't know why, but the crickets make me laugh.

04:26:45.000 --> 04:26:47.000
I don't know why, but the crickets make me laugh.

04:26:47.000 --> 04:26:49.000
I don't know why, but the crickets make me laugh.

04:26:49.000 --> 04:26:51.000
I don't know why, but the crickets make me laugh.

04:26:51.000 --> 04:26:53.000
I don't know why, but the crickets make me laugh.

04:26:53.000 --> 04:26:55.000
I don't know why, but the crickets make me laugh.

04:26:55.000 --> 04:26:57.000
I don't know why, but the crickets make me laugh.

04:26:57.000 --> 04:26:59.000
I don't know why, but the crickets make me laugh.

04:26:59.000 --> 04:27:01.000
I don't know why, but the crickets make me laugh.

04:27:01.000 --> 04:27:03.000
I don't know why, but the crickets make me laugh.

04:27:03.000 --> 04:27:05.000
I don't know why, but the crickets make me laugh.

04:27:05.000 --> 04:27:07.000
I don't know why, but the crickets make me laugh.

04:27:07.000 --> 04:27:09.000
I don't know why, but the crickets make me laugh.

04:27:09.000 --> 04:27:11.000
I don't know why, but the crickets make me laugh.

04:27:16.000 --> 04:27:18.000
What do you get when you cross a snowman and a vampire?

04:27:28.000 --> 04:27:30.000
Why was that so delayed?

04:27:30.000 --> 04:27:32.000
I don't know why the crickets were so delayed.

04:27:32.000 --> 04:27:34.500
That was even more embarrassing.

04:27:34.500 --> 04:27:36.500
That made it worse that the crickets were delayed.

04:27:39.000 --> 04:27:47.240
All right, you ready for this we're skipping we're skipping

04:27:48.600 --> 04:27:51.480
Even the crickets aren't having it literally even showing up

04:27:53.920 --> 04:27:55.920
Eight hours built on the shorter side

04:27:57.800 --> 04:28:03.040
I'll let you like I've kind of mentioned I weave it, but like going offline after two hours

04:28:03.040 --> 04:28:07.200
I like sat and was just staring at the screen for a little bit. I was like

04:28:07.600 --> 04:28:14.120
What do I do now like I've got like an entire day, and I'm not on stream like it felt so weird

04:28:14.920 --> 04:28:16.920
Like I don't

04:28:17.520 --> 04:28:22.400
But I reached them a smart collapse type thing, which is really good

04:28:27.200 --> 04:28:29.200
Our little cheekies are definitely red

04:28:30.040 --> 04:28:31.520
reporting for duty, sir

04:28:32.400 --> 04:28:37.960
I think I'm too German for the jokes are the bad they are terrible the jokes are not funny and

04:28:38.360 --> 04:28:40.360
That is why we we use the

04:28:42.720 --> 04:28:44.720
Cuz no one's laughing at the joke

04:28:46.320 --> 04:28:48.320
Honestly it felt weird like

04:28:49.160 --> 04:28:53.320
I'll every week I do plan in a couple of injured streams

04:28:54.360 --> 04:29:00.080
But the days that have shorter streams like the two are one like I really enjoyed needy streamer overload

04:29:00.080 --> 04:29:03.200
I did not expect to enjoy that. I looked up the

04:29:04.160 --> 04:29:09.640
Ending I would have gotten if I managed to not ignore her and

04:29:11.120 --> 04:29:18.320
Like she was like ready to become a god and like take down 10% of the world's population and all that and I'm like whoa

04:29:19.520 --> 04:29:24.840
I so wish I could have gotten that but I messed up too badly, but that's okay. I couldn't have known you know

04:29:25.320 --> 04:29:27.320
played for the same

04:29:27.320 --> 04:29:32.280
You know you get none of the squat you go you and none of the squad laughing with that one I giggle

04:29:33.320 --> 04:29:36.940
You're still sitting on your feet. I am I'm sitting on my right one right now

04:29:36.940 --> 04:29:41.500
And then the left one is just wiggling the back of the chair. Why do you want to go?

04:29:43.280 --> 04:29:45.280
Don't abuse

04:29:45.320 --> 04:29:47.320
What do you say?

04:29:48.760 --> 04:29:52.440
Niko from undead and what I don't know

04:29:53.440 --> 04:29:59.740
Think of criss-cross applesauce the way you sit like that, but I'm sitting on my foot like against my

04:30:02.960 --> 04:30:09.340
Honestly good way to really enjoy streams of you because I constantly like wiggle and move my legs type thing

04:30:09.340 --> 04:30:11.340
I

04:30:17.180 --> 04:30:21.980
They're putting pressure on moving them like cuz cuz I'm sitting on my foot. There's pressure against it

04:30:21.980 --> 04:30:23.980
So it's like keeping the station

04:30:24.900 --> 04:30:28.180
You get a little ground out of us a little mouth curve

04:30:28.180 --> 04:30:34.620
Oh, yeah, did I have the ability to make you put air out your nose a little just a little bit faster?

04:30:35.620 --> 04:30:37.620
Yeah, I'm thinking

04:30:38.340 --> 04:30:41.900
Crouched no, I'm not I'm not crouching. I'm like sitting on them this time

04:30:41.900 --> 04:30:45.140
But I do go on crouch on the chair sometimes

04:30:45.780 --> 04:30:51.900
Like I was having to send all I was talking to like eight people at once trying to organize something for the girls

04:30:51.900 --> 04:30:54.580
And I was golem crouched on my chair

04:30:55.380 --> 04:31:00.860
Because I was trying to like get it done so fast so I could go to bed because I was exhausted

04:31:01.660 --> 04:31:07.140
I'm like trying to like send this to an editor and upload these files over here and send them off and get the link and make sure

04:31:07.140 --> 04:31:08.900
It's a pretty like oh

04:31:08.900 --> 04:31:10.660
so

04:31:10.660 --> 04:31:12.660
Yeah

04:31:18.260 --> 04:31:22.260
Although they attacked me when I'm Navi as well, so honestly just a wee bit deserve

04:31:22.700 --> 04:31:24.700
Oh

04:31:28.860 --> 04:31:32.260
These things are indestructible honestly

04:31:34.620 --> 04:31:37.260
Should unplug my mouse and keyboard right now just looking

04:31:40.380 --> 04:31:44.420
I'm not even paying attention honestly, I should but

04:31:44.940 --> 04:31:46.940
I

04:31:47.220 --> 04:31:53.900
Think you could probably xp farm here if you had the tolerance for it because you're getting 50 every time and my

04:31:54.420 --> 04:31:56.420
It says I need

04:31:56.420 --> 04:31:58.420
1600 xp to level up

04:31:58.580 --> 04:32:01.780
So yeah, that's the pretty big xp form

04:32:03.500 --> 04:32:05.000
Ow

04:32:05.000 --> 04:32:07.000
my angst

04:32:07.540 --> 04:32:12.220
You're like I got paid to side with the humans. Okay, I got this is

04:32:12.460 --> 04:32:15.300
Not me. I'll put a little disclaimer at the top of the screen. Not me

04:32:19.900 --> 04:32:23.700
You're not funny, but your accent is doing the heavy lifting

04:32:24.740 --> 04:32:29.820
Fucking hell, you're not supposed to say that part out loud. That's supposed to be an inside thought

04:32:32.340 --> 04:32:36.540
Absolutely just got annihilated. Oh my I don't even know if I can come back from that. Oh

04:32:37.740 --> 04:32:39.740
That was brutal

04:32:40.300 --> 04:32:42.700
I can't even come back from that. I

04:32:43.940 --> 04:32:46.540
Got 10 xp from driving over that plan

04:32:48.500 --> 04:32:50.420
Literally

04:32:50.420 --> 04:32:55.300
Okay, the dogs don't get like perish from the bungee

04:32:56.740 --> 04:32:59.820
Which is fine carried by the Scottish

04:33:01.380 --> 04:33:03.380
Literally

04:33:05.060 --> 04:33:07.820
We do have to be careful

04:33:07.940 --> 04:33:09.100
for

04:33:09.100 --> 04:33:11.100
We know

04:33:11.780 --> 04:33:15.340
Do this do the slow mo for me so I can actually oh

04:33:16.060 --> 04:33:18.420
Jeez the way aim ball

04:33:19.620 --> 04:33:26.940
Are you trolling me right now? I'm sorry, but my bullets should have sprayed all over that goodness gravy

04:33:29.420 --> 04:33:31.420
You just like oh I

04:33:33.460 --> 04:33:35.940
Don't like that they win some pain either

04:33:37.820 --> 04:33:39.820
Just feels so mean

04:33:40.220 --> 04:33:42.220
Why are you being so mean?

04:33:43.420 --> 04:33:46.540
You're a mean mean man

04:33:47.380 --> 04:33:50.100
Cuz you're just jealous. Oh

04:33:51.060 --> 04:33:53.260
My gosh, I don't like it. I don't like it

04:33:55.500 --> 04:33:59.940
I'm sure they were probably win some when I was Navi, but it's everything feels so meaner

04:33:59.940 --> 04:34:01.940
I

04:34:03.580 --> 04:34:08.300
I'm going in biz so I can get around here without a tract in the other far away one

04:34:12.660 --> 04:34:18.980
What did that do recovery gather tensile and pulls through our recovery okay my second chance I heard that I heard that I knew you

04:34:21.060 --> 04:34:23.060
Right here we go. Hello

04:34:24.060 --> 04:34:25.060
I

04:34:25.060 --> 04:34:31.380
Just run out here spraying all over. I mean, I'm a cultfish. I don't make sure that it gets far, you know for protection

04:34:32.780 --> 04:34:34.460
to

04:34:34.460 --> 04:34:41.300
Disorientate is it to disorientate creditors and escape the threat and must be whoa whoa whoa

04:34:47.300 --> 04:34:51.820
They have unlimited ammo I do not okay

04:34:53.060 --> 04:34:58.100
Why do I not have unlimited ammo? That's a bit of a problem. I heard that

04:35:02.500 --> 04:35:10.380
I don't see like cuz the camera angle is like way smaller cuz I am smaller as well makes Pandora like even scarier

04:35:13.060 --> 04:35:15.060
Hmm

04:35:16.180 --> 04:35:18.180
The accuracy of our drugs

04:35:23.060 --> 04:35:25.060
Hey

04:35:25.340 --> 04:35:27.340
That is unbelievable

04:35:27.620 --> 04:35:33.220
But that no, it's comedically slow that reverse considering how fast and a

04:35:34.340 --> 04:35:36.020
What's the word?

04:35:36.020 --> 04:35:39.020
Motion sickness and just in the forward spring now

04:35:39.540 --> 04:35:45.820
I've unlocked a grenade launcher. Okay. Maybe maybe mucking around with the weapons would be such a terrible idea

04:35:46.980 --> 04:35:50.140
Trooper pack unlocked some sort of blaze

04:35:51.140 --> 04:35:58.780
Excuse me, excuse me, excuse me. I'm just driving through here. Then you mean me. No, I'm not looking for any trouble. No

04:36:00.020 --> 04:36:03.380
Just backing up here to my meme the dune buggy

04:36:04.580 --> 04:36:10.380
What's that that music video from gorillas that had like a random buggy in the desert? Oh

04:36:10.940 --> 04:36:12.940
I need a gun

04:36:13.540 --> 04:36:17.340
To keep myself from harm the poor people

04:36:18.300 --> 04:36:20.300
Are burning in the sun

04:36:21.740 --> 04:36:23.740
Go a chance

04:36:34.300 --> 04:36:36.300
Then the buggy out of nowhere

04:36:44.220 --> 04:36:46.220
No way

04:36:47.500 --> 04:36:54.020
Old military set of gearbox don't want to go backwards only forwards towards dying enemy

04:36:56.140 --> 04:37:01.300
This is like a flashback right now. Oh, can you like see the music video in your head as I'm talking about it?

04:37:02.420 --> 04:37:07.940
Can I put images in your head if I talk about things? Oh my god, I never even spoke about that

04:37:08.500 --> 04:37:13.220
So I can't like see things in my head the way others can like the way it's just like I can't do that

04:37:13.340 --> 04:37:16.180
So if I say things does it appear in your head?

04:37:17.980 --> 04:37:19.980
Ah

04:37:21.580 --> 04:37:26.400
Sometimes okay, okay, I'm totally not gonna use that

04:37:28.060 --> 04:37:30.060
Against you at any point

04:37:33.020 --> 04:37:37.180
Can I do a music videos I am now making you think of

04:37:38.260 --> 04:37:44.180
The gorillas music video where noodles is dancing in that room and then the guy

04:37:44.540 --> 04:37:50.140
Has a big head and it goes never did no harm never did no harm

04:38:02.780 --> 04:38:07.980
Wait, it's all the wrong one, I don't know one of them the giant head literally it was just a man

04:38:07.980 --> 04:38:11.860
I saw the comments and someone was like that a key Joe

04:38:12.500 --> 04:38:19.700
Honestly his jaw. So, um, if you ever take the recreational

04:38:20.500 --> 04:38:23.820
and also known as bebex to say and

04:38:25.060 --> 04:38:29.820
That makes your jaw clench or something along that line and

04:38:30.820 --> 04:38:32.060
so

04:38:32.060 --> 04:38:35.300
In scott's you say like all his jaw was spinning

04:38:36.140 --> 04:38:38.580
or like he's got an achy jaw and

04:38:38.860 --> 04:38:40.180
And

04:38:40.180 --> 04:38:43.820
Like the comments were all saying that and we'll watch it back and I was like, oh, wow

04:38:45.180 --> 04:38:50.340
Oh, excuse me. Excuse me. I'm just a signal specialist. I'm looking for a fight. Excuse me. Excuse me

04:38:50.340 --> 04:38:53.580
No, no, I didn't want to fight leave me alone. Get me in the boat. Get me in the boat

04:38:54.380 --> 04:38:57.540
Jeez Titanic all over again. Get me in that boat. Oh

04:38:59.060 --> 04:39:01.940
I forgot it's just a little more down here. It's dare

04:39:03.340 --> 04:39:05.860
Do you know the song from grills kids with guns? Oh

04:39:06.860 --> 04:39:14.340
No, sorry, I thought you're referencing that music video. I know the what's that other one? I really like humility

04:39:15.260 --> 04:39:17.260
I don't want no

04:39:17.460 --> 04:39:19.460
Isolation

04:39:19.460 --> 04:39:22.260
You see say I'm in now

04:39:27.460 --> 04:39:31.580
Unfortunately, I don't know the words very well like I never oh, I'm just jumping most of them except in all these

04:39:31.580 --> 04:39:34.740
I've unlocked a nail gun veteran pack. I

04:39:35.340 --> 04:39:41.540
Can call in a motor strike hold on a minute. Hold on a minute. This is actually maybe I admit

04:39:41.540 --> 04:39:47.260
It's a little bit cool. I'll definitely keep zoom because it keeps me away significantly increased damage

04:39:49.820 --> 04:39:51.900
Oh, but that one's

04:39:55.060 --> 04:39:59.940
Calling an airstrike destroying every enemy and be aware it takes a few seconds for the strike to arrive

04:40:00.340 --> 04:40:06.460
Maybe just defense I think defense speed and health to get me out of there and whatever the last one was

04:40:07.100 --> 04:40:12.440
Invisibility and zoom get me out of whatever situation I'm in the video with Jack black

04:40:17.020 --> 04:40:25.380
Yeah, yeah, so I'm about to go full fortune it's on the nappy. I don't know what fortune this one is but

04:40:26.300 --> 04:40:32.180
Hot hot take coming in. Oh, I don't like the gorillas. Oh, yeah, that's okay. You don't have to like everything

04:40:33.460 --> 04:40:37.580
Some things are for some people and some things aren't for some people that is how the world work

04:40:37.580 --> 04:40:43.380
I don't think anyone should be punished. However, if you don't like Assassin's Creed brotherhood, then I will happily

04:40:43.940 --> 04:40:45.940
Put you in either

04:40:45.940 --> 04:40:48.300
Mercy's basement or she bees

04:40:48.980 --> 04:40:51.420
Dungeon take your pick, you know up to you

04:40:52.180 --> 04:40:53.340
Um

04:40:53.340 --> 04:40:57.780
Right, we are just skipping through this for those of you have kind of just joined in you're not quite sure what's going on

04:40:57.780 --> 04:41:02.940
Um, we have successfully finished the nappy side of this game

04:41:03.260 --> 04:41:10.320
We are now purposely joining the RDA, which I have never actually played before but we are still in the tutorial section

04:41:10.320 --> 04:41:13.500
So I know what comes up ahead like it's not a big deal or anything like that

04:41:14.020 --> 04:41:16.020
and I

04:41:16.460 --> 04:41:18.460
Prepare a paranoid myself

04:41:18.500 --> 04:41:20.500
You're always a good girl. Whoa

04:41:21.980 --> 04:41:24.260
Hold on a minute, why am I getting praised out nowhere?

04:41:25.740 --> 04:41:29.420
What are they? Oh, what do I do? Oh, what do I do?

04:41:32.620 --> 04:41:35.060
Not everything know everything but no humor

04:41:39.020 --> 04:41:42.780
Remain just noisy. Whoa, where's the print? Whoa. Whoa. You can't be doing this one

04:41:43.700 --> 04:41:49.300
That's not fair. You know like to take me when I'm not prepared. Okay. That's not fair

04:41:50.060 --> 04:41:54.580
That's cheat see doodling don't cheat see doodle. Okay, Dr. Harper. I presume

04:41:55.180 --> 04:41:57.180
You must be rider

04:41:57.180 --> 04:42:02.140
Let's get you a day needs to do something to prepare it. Oh, I mean, I mean you got you got get the guy give good

04:42:04.820 --> 04:42:08.100
Funny, I think people in there are prizes no punishments

04:42:09.540 --> 04:42:11.540
I'm not here to make enemy

04:42:11.700 --> 04:42:16.220
Then we'll get along just fine now, please go and assist

04:42:17.060 --> 04:42:18.260
Oh

04:42:18.260 --> 04:42:24.780
It's gonna be so weird doing the RDA side you listen noob. I need you to grab me some florist

04:42:24.780 --> 04:42:30.020
Listen noob. You ain't afraid of a few carnivorous plants. Are you aren't afraid of a flower among friends?

04:42:30.860 --> 04:42:37.980
We aren't friends. Oh, you need to learn quick. Okay. Jeez. Lois. Talk about being unfriendly around these part

04:42:38.340 --> 04:42:42.700
Make her blush for every bad joke of today's stream. Honestly, it's been pretty rough

04:42:42.700 --> 04:42:48.300
Right if I remember correctly, there's literally

04:42:49.180 --> 04:42:53.900
Yeah, um, okay. I've just noticed that we have infinite ammo on this gun

04:42:54.740 --> 04:42:56.740
One that's not how they work

04:42:56.820 --> 04:42:58.260
to

04:42:58.260 --> 04:43:06.340
Actually, it's a wee bit of a pet peeve the one all we should watch those Keanu Reeve movies because they have the ammo reload thing, correct

04:43:07.100 --> 04:43:12.000
And how am I trying to say it like in movies where they just like

04:43:12.500 --> 04:43:18.300
With a pistol and like pistol literally have seven max like if you're talking like the M7 or something like that

04:43:18.300 --> 04:43:20.500
Why where the enemies I can hear them. Oh

04:43:24.100 --> 04:43:27.860
Well, I did ask to see them and I can see them loud and clear

04:43:28.540 --> 04:43:31.060
Jeez the camp. I'm stuck on something. Oh

04:43:31.660 --> 04:43:37.180
Jesus, I need I need some space. I need some space in order to like actually shoot please game

04:43:38.100 --> 04:43:41.820
If you're not gonna give me aim assist at least let me fricking shoot

04:43:45.700 --> 04:43:50.460
They sound like buzzle gum from Viva Pinata, it's almost like they're based after flies

04:43:50.460 --> 04:43:52.460
Why

04:43:57.380 --> 04:43:59.300
Johnson the Baba Yaga

04:43:59.300 --> 04:44:05.380
Wic. Yes, that one we should watch those because I like how they're actually accurate with the goons

04:44:07.620 --> 04:44:15.580
It's very nice that they're accurate with the reading. I love the way John Wic uses reloads to set the case for gun face

04:44:15.580 --> 04:44:17.580
I don't know you'll notice that that's true

04:44:20.580 --> 04:44:22.580
Unlimited ammo and mass effect

04:44:26.100 --> 04:44:28.100
Someone said I might like mass effect

04:44:28.940 --> 04:44:33.660
I've actually never played the series before but some said I might like it. I

04:44:34.580 --> 04:44:36.580
Know he's called Sheppard

04:44:37.340 --> 04:44:41.180
That's about it. Oh, no, I don't need to do that at all. I'm getting confused

04:44:42.420 --> 04:44:48.740
All the John Wick movies are good. Yeah, speaking of John Wick. Have you played cyberpunk? No, I haven't I watch

04:44:49.220 --> 04:44:51.220
Shia cyberpunk

04:44:51.700 --> 04:44:53.700
but I am

04:44:54.300 --> 04:44:59.780
I am still absolutely heartbroken about Rebecca. I am so sorry. Is it

04:45:01.100 --> 04:45:03.900
Her name is Rebecca. What's the name of the?

04:45:05.220 --> 04:45:06.820
The cyber

04:45:06.820 --> 04:45:09.180
You're over the rainbow here. Is it Lucy?

04:45:09.620 --> 04:45:16.740
Is it Rebecca and Lucy like brotherhood? I'm getting brotherhood. That's awesome screw brother. Wait, it is Rebecca and Lucy

04:45:17.740 --> 04:45:20.460
What are the odds that assassin creep brotherhood and

04:45:21.660 --> 04:45:23.660
cyberpunk the anime I

04:45:24.180 --> 04:45:29.100
Am I am heartbroken over Rebecca? I'm so sorry. I'm gonna see something so controversial

04:45:29.180 --> 04:45:32.540
I have no comprehension no

04:45:33.340 --> 04:45:39.140
Comprehension on how Rebecca just doesn't auto win like people like all this see this

04:45:40.140 --> 04:45:41.780
Lucy

04:45:41.900 --> 04:45:48.940
Lucy are you can you open your eyes and look at how perfect Rebecca is? I'll actually tell you some more development notes and

04:45:49.900 --> 04:45:51.900
You don't have Rebecca's voice

04:45:52.780 --> 04:45:59.380
And on the concept of I see obviously I see before I see you know applied and all of that

04:45:59.620 --> 04:46:02.820
We actually were quite happy to give I see to

04:46:03.980 --> 04:46:09.740
Someone like that may have had a deeper voice because of Rebecca from cyberpunk. So that's a fun

04:46:10.260 --> 04:46:13.580
Behind-the-scenes and I am not over Rebecca my first

04:46:15.020 --> 04:46:17.020
Trigger I

04:46:17.060 --> 04:46:21.220
Actually, I'm interested in potentially cosplaying her for an ace more stream

04:46:21.220 --> 04:46:25.460
And I think that would be a hoot and holler and I won't show my face

04:46:25.940 --> 04:46:27.940
I'd not

04:46:28.140 --> 04:46:30.140
I'm not for that and

04:46:30.860 --> 04:46:32.860
But I'm happy to do like

04:46:33.340 --> 04:46:34.540
a

04:46:34.540 --> 04:46:36.540
Nick down

04:46:36.860 --> 04:46:44.180
I'm good to sip of my honey tea to see if it's a sip but yeah, I don't know Lucy everyone arguing about Rebecca and Lucy

04:46:44.180 --> 04:46:48.180
I'm like, how is anyone looking at Lucy Rebecca's just peak like design everything

04:46:52.420 --> 04:46:58.140
You know, it's a really sad detail if you haven't seen the cyberpunk anime close your ears for about two minutes

04:46:59.140 --> 04:47:04.300
And after no, no, I need to say this part out loud close your ears for two minutes

04:47:04.300 --> 04:47:09.500
If you don't want spoilers about cyberpunk the anime the really sad fact is that Rebecca

04:47:09.940 --> 04:47:11.940
Got an upgrade to her hands

04:47:12.380 --> 04:47:19.700
after her brother died to the the crazy guy because of the blowback she got from the shotgun

04:47:19.780 --> 04:47:26.780
She never gets any root ricochet from shotguns anymore after that fact after that scene and it's such a sad fact

04:47:26.780 --> 04:47:28.780
But yeah, and

04:47:29.460 --> 04:47:32.720
Anyway, sorry back to the camp back to the actual gameplay

04:47:34.100 --> 04:47:36.100
I'm just really passionate

04:47:36.780 --> 04:47:39.980
The cyber cycle. Yeah, so the cyber cycle takes out her brother

04:47:39.980 --> 04:47:45.940
But in that scene she shoots a shotgun at him and she goes backwards and then after that moment her

04:47:46.740 --> 04:47:53.820
Her hand upgrades come in like her fisty cuffs and she never experiences recoil when shooting weaponry

04:47:54.220 --> 04:47:56.220
And it's all because of that incident

04:47:56.780 --> 04:47:58.780
And it's so sad

04:47:59.180 --> 04:48:03.100
But her design is just beautiful. Absolutely beautiful

04:48:04.980 --> 04:48:06.980
Let me drink my tea

04:48:09.100 --> 04:48:14.420
The recoil so a little background on Rebecca studio trigger was asked to change her because

04:48:14.860 --> 04:48:17.980
Her design was too lollipop a trigger went now lollipops these

04:48:19.420 --> 04:48:21.660
Rebecca definitely influenced I see

04:48:22.580 --> 04:48:29.540
Creation with the hips area and the legs. I'm not even gonna pretend otherwise a peak design. Sorry I

04:48:31.900 --> 04:48:37.340
Knew from the get-go. I wanted a troupe a tan, which is what Emy was and then I see

04:48:38.340 --> 04:48:39.660
and

04:48:39.660 --> 04:48:41.660
It's not true pattern

04:48:41.660 --> 04:48:49.260
but and but I did want her to have like the thickness of Rebecca basically it is I mean

04:48:49.260 --> 04:48:51.260
I'm happy to talk about development. I know it's and

04:48:51.660 --> 04:48:56.860
Like a Zura. We knew we wanted a chocolate and thick. So we've got a goddess and

04:48:57.820 --> 04:49:02.540
Yeah, we just took it from there. Obviously. Um, sorry, let me finish this to you. Oh

04:49:07.300 --> 04:49:09.300
Yeah

04:49:10.900 --> 04:49:17.460
Adam Sandler said you look like a cut of me. Are you wait in the game? I'm pretty sure that's from the game

04:49:17.460 --> 04:49:19.460
I'm sure I've seen a clip of that game

04:49:21.660 --> 04:49:23.660
Coming down with the

04:49:25.700 --> 04:49:29.340
I'll actually tell you some other developmental notes, you know, if I had a lighter voice

04:49:30.780 --> 04:49:32.620
a me

04:49:32.620 --> 04:49:36.380
Amie's design and every in lore and everything if I had a lighter voice

04:49:37.140 --> 04:49:39.140
I

04:49:40.020 --> 04:49:42.020
Would death will be a

04:49:42.020 --> 04:49:44.660
I would death will reflect if I had a lighter voice

04:49:44.660 --> 04:49:49.700
But unfortunately I don't and so, you know, I take like the the big sister look approach

04:49:52.620 --> 04:49:59.940
Yeah, don't be surprised if it an alternative outfits, so I look a bit more true to myself and I am

04:50:02.420 --> 04:50:04.900
I suppose I'm a Rebecca. How tall is Rebecca?

04:50:06.260 --> 04:50:10.300
No, I do it in centimeters. Don't give me freedom units. I can't do freedom units

04:50:11.500 --> 04:50:17.820
But I guess Rebecca's really very reflective. I think that's probably why I'm gravitated towards her so much as well

04:50:18.820 --> 04:50:21.700
Because I'm just like hey, like I just love her

04:50:23.100 --> 04:50:27.540
I'm gonna leave for the night. So here's your bro teeth brushing. Yes. Thank you

04:50:28.140 --> 04:50:31.860
So I'm gonna burp my tea up if I'm not careful hold on a minute

04:50:33.500 --> 04:50:41.540
No, I'm just gonna check how far away my my delivery is of my Mac is my cheeky Mac is any any Mac

04:50:48.820 --> 04:50:55.220
It's still on its way freaking driver at the restaurant always driver at the restaurant

04:50:55.220 --> 04:50:57.380
It's never drivers picked it up and it's already on its way

04:50:57.380 --> 04:51:00.980
It's always at the restaurant just hanging about waiting for a second freaking order. I

04:51:02.820 --> 04:51:04.820
Know that shit's gonna get here cool

04:51:05.060 --> 04:51:08.060
The version 2.0 update they did on smashers

04:51:09.300 --> 04:51:15.700
He needed the update who's smash her she's a hundred and forty five one fifty. Oh, I'm too tall for Rebecca

04:51:18.700 --> 04:51:21.180
Oh, I need to get at that to the same board

04:51:24.660 --> 04:51:26.660
For now, I'll just use my

04:51:27.780 --> 04:51:29.780
Adam's matter. Oh

04:51:30.660 --> 04:51:37.300
The guy that says the quote she's around one five two wait. I'm out. No, I'm not I'm one six. Okay

04:51:40.300 --> 04:51:45.540
Okay, take Rebecca and make her slightly taller. Oh my god me. She's so me for real for real

04:51:46.220 --> 04:51:48.220
She's so me for real

04:51:51.060 --> 04:51:54.660
Behold how tall she's streaming on out. Mm-hmm. True. Oh

04:51:57.380 --> 04:51:59.380
No, it's time

04:52:00.140 --> 04:52:02.140
We're the baddies

04:52:02.860 --> 04:52:07.820
He said the B word wait, why the stuff that was put the B word together

04:52:08.780 --> 04:52:09.980
Oh

04:52:09.980 --> 04:52:16.980
I'm sad. I don't want to expect from here on out though. It's Johnny told Rebecca comes honestly

04:52:19.980 --> 04:52:21.980
We can't see

04:52:23.500 --> 04:52:30.020
The donations are broken again. Are they actually great work, right? I smell promotion in the air. Oh, yeah, pay

04:52:31.860 --> 04:52:36.020
Better not. Please tell me you guys haven't given me so much money. It's broken again

04:52:38.620 --> 04:52:44.300
Have you broken it again, be honest be honest. There's a page not load. I

04:52:45.980 --> 04:52:50.420
Like the edits of John Wick and cyberpunk so funny of him see yes. Oh my god

04:52:50.420 --> 04:52:55.540
I wanted to do that with the girls debuts, but I don't have time. I have the highlight

04:52:56.140 --> 04:52:59.620
There are currently two out of six highlight debuts

04:53:00.420 --> 04:53:03.660
Created so far and I'm so excited

04:53:04.500 --> 04:53:08.340
It mercies and azures, but I'm gonna release them all at the same time

04:53:09.140 --> 04:53:11.860
but mercies and azures have been made and

04:53:12.860 --> 04:53:15.180
The rest are on the way. It's so exciting

04:53:16.060 --> 04:53:19.260
It's loading but not going through it. Wow. I really is broke. Wow

04:53:20.820 --> 04:53:22.820
Thanks again for breaking

04:53:24.340 --> 04:53:26.340
Are you guys at all?

04:53:30.300 --> 04:53:32.900
It's never never we're the baddies

04:53:34.100 --> 04:53:36.660
Against these guys we can take them

04:53:38.940 --> 04:53:42.500
Let's do it right now right now. I order you to shoot

04:53:44.300 --> 04:53:46.620
Well, this is it

04:53:48.180 --> 04:53:50.180
This is it

04:53:51.980 --> 04:53:53.980
We're doing it we're the baddies

04:53:56.140 --> 04:53:58.140
We'll just spam them down I guess

04:53:59.140 --> 04:54:01.140
I

04:54:01.620 --> 04:54:03.620
Missing because of the hit marker

04:54:05.100 --> 04:54:11.060
Please don't heal don't make this harder than it has to be unironically because I'm not I feel bad

04:54:12.420 --> 04:54:14.420
I picked the woman's

04:54:18.540 --> 04:54:20.540
I

04:54:21.740 --> 04:54:26.140
Didn't think that was possible. Have you broken it twice? Hold on

04:54:28.820 --> 04:54:30.820
You feel

04:54:35.460 --> 04:54:41.540
Wait, what happens? No, I can't be a Navi like I'm a fully human like I'll never be able to go back

04:54:42.300 --> 04:54:47.060
Wait a word good girl. Oh, yeah, so it does work

04:54:49.300 --> 04:54:53.220
Thank you for the tip no, I don't know what to respond to that

04:54:54.100 --> 04:54:56.100
Maybe

04:54:58.900 --> 04:55:03.420
Well, wait, so it does work and maybe just Tame and yo because it's

04:55:14.140 --> 04:55:16.140
It works in fire folks

04:55:16.140 --> 04:55:21.140
Anyway, you don't actually have to tip or donate or anything

04:55:22.060 --> 04:55:24.060
But thank you very much

04:55:27.660 --> 04:55:31.340
We just got annihilated by a Banshee cheese. Oh

04:55:33.380 --> 04:55:36.700
Well, we all saw that move in the frame, but hey, oh

04:55:38.540 --> 04:55:41.540
Okay, this is actually quite different. I thought he was just gonna

04:55:46.180 --> 04:55:49.940
Wow, I didn't even know

04:55:53.660 --> 04:55:55.660
We don't have to but we want to give her

04:55:58.860 --> 04:56:00.780
Oh my gosh, okay

04:56:02.300 --> 04:56:06.100
Well, we survived a helicopter crash and an attack from an akra

04:56:06.100 --> 04:56:11.060
Are you all right? I think I'm okay, but the pilots banged up pretty bad

04:56:11.780 --> 04:56:14.620
Radio's fried, too. You've got to go for help

04:56:19.820 --> 04:56:23.340
Don't worry, I'll be fine. I've got a full clip any vultures

04:56:25.220 --> 04:56:27.220
Have to go out on my own

04:56:28.900 --> 04:56:31.900
No, I don't want to go out on my own. I'm scared

04:56:32.660 --> 04:56:34.660
Oh

04:56:37.580 --> 04:56:43.740
Have I got you oh wait, so is this my wardrobe change? Oh, I literally is it's just more

04:56:48.500 --> 04:56:54.300
That's just follow the hood that says to go this way what she shouldn't she shouldn't what she is

04:56:55.060 --> 04:56:57.580
Things can attack me from the sky as well

04:56:58.100 --> 04:57:00.100
Hmm

04:57:00.460 --> 04:57:03.540
Wait, these aren't recycled maps at all

04:57:05.780 --> 04:57:09.900
No, the plan I'm scared wait, I can't have a limit on

04:57:15.940 --> 04:57:19.420
Is it maybe the head is gonna take more damage

04:57:20.420 --> 04:57:22.420
I

04:57:24.060 --> 04:57:26.940
Flamethrowers are effective against all plants that have one

04:57:32.060 --> 04:57:37.540
Don't have a flamethrower. Oh I have infinite pistol. Okay. Okay

04:57:40.580 --> 04:57:42.580
I have to show my shooting skills

04:57:42.940 --> 04:57:50.460
Literally, I thought they were just gonna recycle all of the maps, but this is like an entirely new side of the game

04:57:50.460 --> 04:57:54.560
I know this sounds so silly, but I just assumed the recycle the maps and like oh

04:57:55.900 --> 04:57:57.900
I'm claiming that all right

04:58:01.180 --> 04:58:03.100
Okay, I can do it

04:58:06.220 --> 04:58:08.220
Okay, I've got more ammo

04:58:09.020 --> 04:58:11.540
Did he do the ikran?

04:58:12.580 --> 04:58:22.820
Okay, I get points for this. Oh, I'm so tiny. I'm so small. I can't even I can't even see over the freaking grass to see the enemies

04:58:25.220 --> 04:58:28.460
Oh my gosh, give me more ammo. Oh

04:58:29.860 --> 04:58:32.380
Stop spawning in I need to heal

04:58:33.820 --> 04:58:35.820
Right, we're doing a biz

04:58:37.380 --> 04:58:39.380
There's one over

04:58:39.380 --> 04:58:41.380
Oh

04:58:59.940 --> 04:59:03.980
I can do it. I can do it. I can do it. I need a level up so quick so I can just keep spamming that run

04:59:03.980 --> 04:59:05.980
Oh

04:59:09.020 --> 04:59:11.020
There's so many plants in the way as well

04:59:16.180 --> 04:59:20.180
I'm so tall. I'm so small. I'm not myself tall. Oh

04:59:21.620 --> 04:59:24.100
I can't do it. I'm actually sweating right now

04:59:28.220 --> 04:59:32.300
Can I make it through the poison without having to destroy them all the time? Oh

04:59:33.980 --> 04:59:35.980
Please keep your ink to yourself

04:59:36.540 --> 04:59:39.620
What are these? Are these bombs? Oh

04:59:41.420 --> 04:59:44.460
I think the pretty I don't the purple have health. I think they're

04:59:51.180 --> 04:59:55.220
Well, there's no secret behind this waterfall like in Legend of Zelda

04:59:56.220 --> 05:00:01.220
Right, let's try that again. I didn't know me. Yeah, I didn't know me to the oh good as we

05:00:02.180 --> 05:00:06.780
Using vehicles and amp suits will be your friend. Okay, so I'm gonna says oh

05:00:09.060 --> 05:00:13.060
Moby heart, right, let's try that again without doing that

05:00:14.540 --> 05:00:16.540
No running

05:00:16.660 --> 05:00:21.700
Just shoot. Why are you not responding? Can I respond or my game already broke?

05:00:23.540 --> 05:00:30.080
All right, hold on hold on. I think my delivery app just a just oh, oh my delivery

05:00:30.440 --> 05:00:35.620
Hold on. We've got a food delivery. Is that gonna swipe for me as a health bar?

05:00:36.680 --> 05:00:38.680
Hold on. Let me go at the front door

05:01:00.080 --> 05:01:02.080
Oh

05:01:02.080 --> 05:01:04.080
Oh

05:01:04.080 --> 05:01:06.080
Oh

05:01:26.760 --> 05:01:28.760
There

05:01:35.080 --> 05:01:40.680
Oh, yeah, okay, I'm glad that thing doesn't slip down and like take my fricking eyeballs out must go

05:01:42.520 --> 05:01:48.960
Rather terrifying my McDonald right. I've got chicken nuggies for everyone open your mouth go

05:01:54.760 --> 05:01:56.760
Wow, I've got

05:01:57.760 --> 05:02:04.360
Is the fricking how you call it this the thingy my Bulbas

05:02:09.320 --> 05:02:12.560
Why the wicked it is so bad for me

05:02:14.520 --> 05:02:16.520
But if it's bad for me

05:02:20.360 --> 05:02:25.200
Well, it's a lamp in the Navy so brave. I'm sorry. I'm so bad at this like

05:02:27.760 --> 05:02:33.760
Mmm, you're having a sip of my chocolate milkshake. Yes, I'm actually having a chocolate milk shake at 9 a.m

05:02:33.760 --> 05:02:35.760
And then nothing you can do about it

05:02:39.640 --> 05:02:44.880
Is it cold you bet your ass it's cold because that guy was sitting at a flipping restaurant for ages

05:02:45.960 --> 05:02:49.640
Okay, um, I would tab out to read any

05:02:50.480 --> 05:02:56.160
Marshmallows, however the game breaks when I do that. So I'm just gonna read chat and munch away

05:02:57.520 --> 05:03:03.880
So, please if you don't like munching sounds and he's live. She's live, but me I'm a munching your ears

05:03:08.280 --> 05:03:10.920
I'm having a beer at 7 a.m. I

05:03:14.160 --> 05:03:18.600
Will enjoy my new they just spicy nuggies so I've got spicy

05:03:22.520 --> 05:03:24.520
And mukbang time honestly

05:03:27.760 --> 05:03:30.440
More headpats for the most adorable cutlery

05:03:35.600 --> 05:03:37.360
Okay

05:03:37.360 --> 05:03:42.960
Hopefully I don't mess up too many times actually doing the RDA campaign, but I have to admit

05:03:42.960 --> 05:03:46.960
It's like terrifying. I had no I thought the maps were gonna be the same and I was like, okay

05:03:46.960 --> 05:03:49.920
At least the maps are the same and I'm familiar with the past. Nope

05:03:51.640 --> 05:03:53.640
Mmm

05:03:54.320 --> 05:03:58.200
I don't they apparently sold 2.7 million copies of this game

05:03:59.040 --> 05:04:05.000
Yeah, that seems really low for like any game. I feel like that. Does that mean it full-option?

05:04:09.360 --> 05:04:14.000
Mm-hmm, I'm gonna inspire people to get a McDonald's breakfast at this rate

05:04:17.080 --> 05:04:19.080
You it

05:04:20.080 --> 05:04:26.320
A little hard in America they do 24 hour breakfast, so I'm jealous. I have to admit

05:04:34.840 --> 05:04:38.360
You still think the tips are slightly broken or you're getting limited. Oh

05:04:41.040 --> 05:04:43.040
Hmm

05:04:43.880 --> 05:04:45.880
I'm not sure

05:04:46.200 --> 05:04:47.440
That

05:04:47.440 --> 05:04:52.240
Last tip did come through I wonder why that would be maybe reach every region locked

05:04:53.720 --> 05:04:55.960
No, that seems silly, that's the answer I

05:04:58.120 --> 05:05:03.440
Don't like break I don't like the breakfast menu of most fast food places rather try it for me menus on

05:05:05.800 --> 05:05:12.480
I know it sounds weird, but I love to make some nuggies a salad and put them both together and

05:05:13.200 --> 05:05:16.880
Wheatwrap and yogurt that just sounds like a

05:05:17.880 --> 05:05:19.360
and

05:05:19.360 --> 05:05:22.080
What's that Greek thing? Where's the chicken in a wrap?

05:05:23.040 --> 05:05:26.240
I've completely not kebab, but like it's on different

05:05:27.720 --> 05:05:29.720
We're back in 10 minutes

05:05:30.800 --> 05:05:32.800
See you shortly

05:05:33.480 --> 05:05:35.480
and a

05:05:35.880 --> 05:05:37.160
Jiro

05:05:37.160 --> 05:05:41.160
Fun fact gyro means to be on benefits in Scotland

05:05:43.440 --> 05:05:47.760
Alarm gyro, okay gyro is great. Oh, but it's with pork. Okay. Okay. Oh

05:05:48.720 --> 05:05:50.720
It's over

05:05:51.200 --> 05:05:53.200
It's pronounced you know

05:05:53.560 --> 05:05:56.600
Then why did the Fanny's put a G in front of it?

05:06:01.240 --> 05:06:07.160
We've got them got them in 4k as I drop a chip on me. Oh

05:06:07.280 --> 05:06:09.280
Oh

05:06:12.120 --> 05:06:14.280
It's and it's gif

05:06:15.040 --> 05:06:21.440
It's not a Jeff. It's a gif. I don't know why Jeff started and if your name is Jeff

05:06:22.680 --> 05:06:26.000
Or should I be like, I can grasp your names Jeff because it sounds like Jeff I

05:06:28.840 --> 05:06:34.960
Don't comprehend where Jeff came from unless it was from non native English speakers. That's the only like and

05:06:35.960 --> 05:06:42.920
Thingy, I don't know why it is a thing. Obviously. It's funny in internet culture, but why is it Jeff?

05:06:43.960 --> 05:06:45.960
I know Jeff literally

05:06:49.960 --> 05:06:54.240

The UK it's a shop called pray mark. Okay. It's like a clothes shop. It's like and

05:07:07.880 --> 05:07:14.320
It's called pray mark, but folks say it pre mark and the folk that say it pre mark

05:07:14.320 --> 05:07:16.820
I'm talking to you right now directly

05:07:17.320 --> 05:07:21.920

Congrats if you names mark by the way

05:07:38.340 --> 05:07:40.340
I don't know why

05:07:41.180 --> 05:07:43.780
It's a debate and the UK

05:07:44.620 --> 05:07:46.180
Pray Murray

05:07:46.180 --> 05:07:52.100

Congrats if you names mark

05:07:59.140 --> 05:08:02.300
Also, Jeff is a peanut butter company. Is it

05:08:14.620 --> 05:08:15.980
Okay

05:08:15.980 --> 05:08:17.980
our peanut butter and

05:08:18.140 --> 05:08:20.860
And jelly sandwiches actually is tasty as

05:08:21.740 --> 05:08:27.980
American movies make it out to be because all kids unanimously in TV shows have a PB and J

05:08:28.260 --> 05:08:32.440
Is it actually that good or is it being hyped up as I choke on my food?

05:08:38.500 --> 05:08:43.660
It's a comfort food. Yes, it's okay. She seems to think so. Okay. She be's word is law

05:08:44.220 --> 05:08:49.320
Yes, it's overhyped. Yes. It's an acquired taste. It's good yet. PB and J is good

05:08:49.940 --> 05:08:52.860
They can't be it's okay. Diabetes in a sandwich

05:08:53.380 --> 05:08:55.380
I

05:08:55.620 --> 05:08:59.620
Absolutely, they're a good tree. Okay. It's a tree kind of not like a everyday thing

05:09:01.300 --> 05:09:04.980
Mmm, I skipped the jelly and only the peanut bar

05:09:07.020 --> 05:09:09.020
I've tried the jar ones it's

05:09:09.540 --> 05:09:11.540
Pretty okay, but just okay

05:09:11.820 --> 05:09:15.780
It's a thing they are raised on so as a result. They love it. Mmm. I

05:09:16.740 --> 05:09:21.860
Suppose like iron brews my example if you don't drink iron brews a kid, you'll never have a taste for it

05:09:22.860 --> 05:09:24.860
It's so bizarre and flavor

05:09:26.220 --> 05:09:28.220
It's like that and

05:09:28.860 --> 05:09:30.860
Japanese natto

05:09:31.300 --> 05:09:33.300
fermented soybeans is a breakfast thing

05:09:34.380 --> 05:09:37.020
apparently if you are a back-of-guy gene and

05:09:38.060 --> 05:09:44.060
You like it's really hard to enjoy natto unless you like force yourself to eat it over a while and then you get used to that

05:09:46.140 --> 05:09:48.900
Yeah, like it's hard it's hard to get into it. Mmm

05:09:49.860 --> 05:09:54.700
Remember the old commercial from it made from

05:09:56.060 --> 05:09:58.060
Gerders

05:09:59.980 --> 05:10:02.420
It's cheap as heck and that's why we eat it so much

05:10:03.420 --> 05:10:07.620
I've had peanut butter toast and banana and it's delicious. It's very nice

05:10:07.740 --> 05:10:14.500
What's iron brews supposed to taste like they advertise it as ginger and bubblegum and it tastes like battery acid that's only

05:10:14.980 --> 05:10:16.140
explicable

05:10:16.140 --> 05:10:21.620
Way that you can see what that orange liquid tastes like it's battery acid, but nice

05:10:24.060 --> 05:10:26.060
Mmm

05:10:28.700 --> 05:10:31.820
Literally mountain juice is the closest you'll ever get to it

05:10:32.980 --> 05:10:38.060
That is just not positive. Sorry. I'm trying to eat and talk and I want to eat the food as fast as possible

05:10:38.060 --> 05:10:40.700
So I'm not holding up the gameplay too much. Hmm. I

05:10:41.660 --> 05:10:43.660
Take a drink from my chucky milkshake

05:10:46.940 --> 05:10:52.940
Hmm, they forgot to give me a straw. So I'm literally just drinking out of it like some animal

05:10:56.460 --> 05:11:00.780
Hmm, do you see mountain dew? Yes, I said mountain dew

05:11:03.660 --> 05:11:05.660
Oh dude, no

05:11:06.300 --> 05:11:10.940
Mountain dew, mountain dew, mountain dew. Whoa, that's so close

05:11:11.580 --> 05:11:15.180
Mountain dew. Whoa, you can't tell the difference when I say that

05:11:16.300 --> 05:11:18.300
Oh, that's crazy. Mountain dew

05:11:19.180 --> 05:11:22.140
Whoa, it sounds like I'm saying Jay, but I'm no

05:11:23.100 --> 05:11:25.100
I'm saying you

05:11:25.740 --> 05:11:27.740
Oh, that's so cool

05:11:29.660 --> 05:11:33.020
Did you drink my manju? Oh, that's weird

05:11:35.660 --> 05:11:40.940
Mmm, okay, I didn't know I said I like that because I'm here now literally

05:11:41.900 --> 05:11:43.900
Did you drink my manju?

05:11:44.860 --> 05:11:48.300
Wow, why does it sound like that? I can hear it. No, do you

05:11:49.740 --> 05:11:52.460
Did you drink my mountain dew?

05:11:54.220 --> 05:11:56.220
Dew

05:11:58.380 --> 05:12:01.100
Yeah, I've tried manju. I don't think it tastes like I'm brutal

05:12:01.100 --> 05:12:07.180
No, but it's it's only the closest thing. It's a German. I feel not good here. Monka is bro

05:12:07.180 --> 05:12:09.180
Love

05:12:12.780 --> 05:12:20.700
To do a drop of dew and a dew gets all the same pronunciation

05:12:29.900 --> 05:12:31.900
You now have a new earworm enjoy

05:12:32.860 --> 05:12:38.620
All right, I've got two more nuggies left and then I've got this like uh burger mcgrittle thingy

05:12:38.620 --> 05:12:42.860
I don't know what it's called. It's called mcmuffin. That's what we call it mcmuffin, but I think it's called mcgrittle

05:12:46.940 --> 05:12:50.460
Mountain dew was originally made to be a mixer for whiskey

05:12:54.060 --> 05:12:57.340
I don't know when I'm gonna do my first like drunk stream

05:12:58.300 --> 05:13:02.700
I'm down for drunk karaoke, but I would have to rest my voice a day before

05:13:05.260 --> 05:13:10.540
I was very nervous about it like the first time I ever did it, but now I know that

05:13:11.500 --> 05:13:14.380
I'm not hitting them notes. So I'm gonna go for it. I'm gonna send it

05:13:14.620 --> 05:13:16.620
Mmm

05:13:24.780 --> 05:13:31.580
The original coca-cola had cocaine in it. Honestly, I just know that

05:13:33.500 --> 05:13:36.940
It would just have been such a good time to be drinking that stuff, you know what I'm saying

05:13:37.420 --> 05:13:39.420
I

05:13:40.940 --> 05:13:49.660
I'm sure I learned as well that um, what did I learn that they used to prescribe like um

05:13:51.500 --> 05:13:56.140
I was a heroine they used to prescribe that if you were feeling rough back in the day

05:13:59.180 --> 05:14:02.860
The drunk stream would give a hundred percent a hundred out of hand barb, I'm sorry

05:14:03.420 --> 05:14:10.860
Here in brazil come to brazil many restaurants serve nuggets with creamy cheese or green green sauce

05:14:11.260 --> 05:14:14.540
What would green sauce consist of would be some sort of veggie blended up

05:14:16.460 --> 05:14:18.460
I would do cheese sauce definitely

05:14:20.300 --> 05:14:22.300
Sorry, I'm looking my fingers like an animal

05:14:26.060 --> 05:14:31.100
Most of the nasty addictive drugs started as medicines honestly like they were just having a good time back then

05:14:31.980 --> 05:14:36.300
I just choked. Um, I don't know if you've ever heard about this guy called Sigmund Freud

05:14:37.020 --> 05:14:42.140
He was absolutely wild and with his theories, but he was also highly addicted to

05:14:42.940 --> 05:14:44.780
and um

05:14:44.780 --> 05:14:51.660
Like a lot of his stuff got discredited, but like as time progresses he gets proven right again and again

05:14:52.060 --> 05:14:54.060
Um

05:14:59.580 --> 05:15:06.860
Also, there is the oh my god, this looks fucking awesome. I'm gonna take a big juicy bite for you

05:15:11.100 --> 05:15:13.020

I went out yesterday after stream to get those american sweets

05:15:17.340 --> 05:15:19.340

05:15:19.420 --> 05:15:22.860
The lady was so nice. She was like, oh, can I help you anything?

05:15:23.820 --> 05:15:25.500
and I'm just like

05:15:25.500 --> 05:15:27.500
Anything american you've got

05:15:27.980 --> 05:15:29.980
That's like smaller packaging

05:15:30.780 --> 05:15:33.740
I would love to take away with me because i'm just gonna taste it all

05:15:34.460 --> 05:15:36.460
And she was like so nice and helpful

05:15:36.540 --> 05:15:42.460
But she was so surprised with how much i'm buying and I didn't want to be like, oh i'm written them on a stream and all that

05:15:42.540 --> 05:15:46.460
I was just like, I'm just really passionate about american sweets. Yeehaw

05:15:47.420 --> 05:15:49.420
All right

05:15:52.780 --> 05:15:55.020
Hmm it was like a

05:15:57.420 --> 05:16:01.340
Ammonpaw independent shop that I supported

05:16:03.740 --> 05:16:12.380
And I'm gonna inhale another bite. This is good. Yeehaw. Sorry, that is that's just what I imagined like am I at yeehaw at any moment yeehaw

05:16:12.380 --> 05:16:21.980
They used to prescribe, they used to prescribe smoking at people we asked them off. That's terrible. Go on a brother

05:16:24.300 --> 05:16:29.180
You got a pretty accurate spread of my, well like I put the picture in the discord for the girls to rate it

05:16:30.060 --> 05:16:31.900
and I told them

05:16:31.900 --> 05:16:37.740
I spent 53 dollars getting all of that stuff and they were like you got absolutely scammed

05:16:38.140 --> 05:16:41.260
Like that's not even worth 12 dollars. I'm like, oh, okay

05:16:42.140 --> 05:16:45.100
But um, I'm gonna make a little

05:16:46.380 --> 05:16:47.980
Rate thing

05:16:47.980 --> 05:16:49.020
um

05:16:49.020 --> 05:16:50.780
Like where I rate them

05:16:50.780 --> 05:16:55.100
So hopefully we'll do a fun little chart. I don't know if I'm gonna like anything

05:16:57.580 --> 05:17:05.660
I think I'm interested in this was it spicy cheetos I call or spicy thingy or the or tackies or whatever

05:17:06.220 --> 05:17:08.220
I always hear about tacky

05:17:08.540 --> 05:17:09.660
um

05:17:09.660 --> 05:17:11.660
And it was

05:17:15.500 --> 05:17:17.500
Mmm

05:17:18.620 --> 05:17:22.780
It was rough, but like I'm gonna support like a wee independent shop. So

05:17:25.820 --> 05:17:30.540
Eat the chips last it's overpowering. Oh, okay. Okay. Okay. We're getting the strats. Thank you, mayor

05:17:30.700 --> 05:17:32.220
See for the strats

05:17:32.220 --> 05:17:37.420
Are you streaming the day? Well we T-minus well less than four hours for mercies. Use your start time

05:17:37.980 --> 05:17:39.980
I

05:17:44.300 --> 05:17:50.060
Don't know what don't I thought dr. Pepper was in the uk but

05:17:52.300 --> 05:17:57.580
I think I'm confusing it with pepsi. I genuinely can't remember if I've ever tried dr. Pepper if it's an american thing

05:18:01.180 --> 05:18:05.340
Oh, you're playing that climbing game. I remember the thumbnail

05:18:07.660 --> 05:18:12.220
Because we had your skirt was open so we had to close your skirt

05:18:14.460 --> 05:18:20.380
Honestly, maybe that should be a toggle for you. No, I'm not. Maybe we should toggle that so you don't have to worry

05:18:26.220 --> 05:18:31.340
Dr. Pepper isn't the okay. I've just never tasted it before literally i'm brewing cola

05:18:31.900 --> 05:18:36.140
I used to be a fan of fiend and a sprite fiend as well

05:18:37.020 --> 05:18:39.420
But fan are like addicted to so much

05:18:43.500 --> 05:18:50.860
I do have an american dr. Pepper so at least I can stay true to the the task at hand not my open skirt, honestly

05:18:55.580 --> 05:18:59.100
Then you can accidentally toggle on and off and stream true

05:19:02.140 --> 05:19:05.020
The only person who worries for receiving followers aim

05:19:07.020 --> 05:19:14.060
Dr. Pepper taste dr. Pepper taste kind of cola with with mint mint mint fizzy juice

05:19:14.860 --> 05:19:18.460
I'm not sure mint fizzy juice is gonna go down well with me. I do apologize

05:19:26.540 --> 05:19:29.660
I just remembered i'm not sure another brazilian already took it first

05:19:30.620 --> 05:19:34.460
So i'll do it myself come to brazil cutlass congrats. You're the first one to do it

05:19:35.340 --> 05:19:37.340
Come to brazil

05:19:37.420 --> 05:19:39.420
I don't think I know any

05:19:41.260 --> 05:19:43.260
Plus so tell a bay

05:19:44.460 --> 05:19:46.940
So so tell a bay is all I can say

05:19:52.140 --> 05:19:55.900
I'm almost finished. I'm so sorry for those who are waiting on the gameplay

05:19:57.340 --> 05:19:59.340
I think dr. Pepper tasted medicine

05:20:00.220 --> 05:20:01.740
mint

05:20:01.740 --> 05:20:05.260
Not like cinnamon. Sorry not ice cream soda just cream soda

05:20:08.940 --> 05:20:10.940
Dr. Pepper's cherry cola

05:20:14.060 --> 05:20:15.420
Hmm

05:20:15.420 --> 05:20:22.060
The guys see the online discourse about the ingredients in like american food versus like any other country

05:20:22.620 --> 05:20:24.620
And like so much stuff has been banned

05:20:24.940 --> 05:20:26.940
Hmm

05:20:28.460 --> 05:20:34.380
Hey, stroney, did you know that mint and spicy can be active at the same time in your mouth try it in your experience heck

05:20:35.740 --> 05:20:37.740
Mint and spicy

05:20:41.260 --> 05:20:46.940
I've never even thought of that. Yeah, that's never occurred. It's like spicy water

05:20:48.700 --> 05:20:50.700
It'll be interesting to see what you actually enjoy

05:20:51.180 --> 05:20:52.300
Hmm

05:20:52.300 --> 05:20:54.780
I think that other drink was a and w

05:20:55.980 --> 05:21:02.300
Root by air. I think I got like creamy. I think it was cream soda or creamy soda a root by air root by air

05:21:03.420 --> 05:21:05.420
No, root by your root by air

05:21:06.220 --> 05:21:10.300
McDonald's you can check for ingredients but don't you say 35 ingredients most of them are code numbers?

05:21:11.340 --> 05:21:14.780
Oh, yeah, american drinks for instance. They often use high fructose corn syrup and

05:21:15.340 --> 05:21:22.620
What happens if I ingest high fructose corn syrup die like explode? It's a dangerous

05:21:30.700 --> 05:21:32.700
Hmm

05:21:32.940 --> 05:21:34.940
No, kinder eggs

05:21:35.180 --> 05:21:38.860
Actually, you know what's even sadder about the kinder egg ban the new realize

05:21:39.500 --> 05:21:41.500
The only reason those children

05:21:41.900 --> 05:21:48.220
Hmm past because of the kinder egg was because their parents weren't even paying attention to them

05:21:48.860 --> 05:21:50.860
Which is such a wee shame like it's

05:21:53.100 --> 05:21:55.100
Um

05:21:57.900 --> 05:21:59.900
They have to ban it

05:22:00.060 --> 05:22:05.580
Instead of being like hey here public announcement pay attention to your little ones because we didn't know

05:22:06.140 --> 05:22:07.100
um

05:22:07.100 --> 05:22:09.100
little ones explore

05:22:09.660 --> 05:22:15.340
Using their mouth. That's why you can imagine literally licking any surface because you did it as a wee babby

05:22:15.340 --> 05:22:18.140
It's an exploratory thing. You you learned so much from it

05:22:19.420 --> 05:22:21.420
Like for example if I tell you

05:22:22.140 --> 05:22:25.980
Uh to imagine what it's like licking a cold pole with rain

05:22:27.260 --> 05:22:31.820
It's gonna sound i'm in danger. Why is it red? Why is it red? I saw that

05:22:33.260 --> 05:22:35.900
I saw that I just entered combat there for a second

05:22:36.700 --> 05:22:40.380
Monka is Monka is I saw that those like I'm not watching your game

05:22:42.060 --> 05:22:44.060
um

05:22:44.380 --> 05:22:48.300
My HUD went red. I I'm covering up the HUD like with my big hair

05:22:48.700 --> 05:22:53.260
But it went red which meant I was under attack there. So I don't know what just happened

05:22:58.620 --> 05:23:02.700
The kinder the American kinder egg man is real if I was a mean no I feel

05:23:06.620 --> 05:23:08.620
Oh

05:23:10.380 --> 05:23:13.180
Is that also why there's no toys in the cereal and everyone thought about that

05:23:20.860 --> 05:23:22.860
I'll flew into my cross here. Mm-hmm

05:23:27.740 --> 05:23:29.740
Okay, last bite

05:23:29.820 --> 05:23:33.900
Last bite. I'm gonna go get a cola. Actually, I wouldn't mind a cola after that

05:23:33.900 --> 05:23:38.780
Just to really really make sure my health was really bad. Uh, mcdonald's on a cola. Why not?

05:23:41.180 --> 05:23:43.180
I won't make

05:24:04.540 --> 05:24:08.300
I'm so true that's a oh my god my headset

05:24:10.540 --> 05:24:14.700
My headset just moved in a flinch. I don't think I was getting attacked in real life

05:24:16.220 --> 05:24:18.220
Yes, I was

05:24:19.340 --> 05:24:21.740
I'm farming the dump it on this one

05:24:23.660 --> 05:24:26.060
I ain't swallowed this before I choke. Hold on a minute

05:24:26.780 --> 05:24:28.780
Oh

05:24:29.820 --> 05:24:35.100
Okay, cola time have a little sip of cola with the edge. I'll try and have a little bit more of that milkshake

05:24:38.380 --> 05:24:40.380
Yucky milkshake

05:24:44.380 --> 05:24:49.980
Right, I've probably got a big burp generator eaten because I've just eaten so I do apologize unless you want me to get out of the way in there

05:24:50.860 --> 05:24:54.540
Mm-hmm, so I can have a sip you absolutely can't have a sip of the cola

05:24:57.020 --> 05:24:59.420
Oh, so how's the Nutella seen in your countries?

05:25:00.780 --> 05:25:02.780

Although I know in the Belgium they have these like adorable little self-serve size Nutella

Banshee's been killed by men, but thanks for the company

05:27:09.980 --> 05:27:11.980
I've not tried it. No our vigilmate. No

05:27:12.780 --> 05:27:17.180
She's fueled up better firing circuits are fried because everyone's giving it such a terrible review

05:27:17.180 --> 05:27:20.220
I'm like, I don't really want to spend money on it just to like have a wee dip

05:27:20.860 --> 05:27:24.780
Look around they destroy my paper. You don't have to tell me

05:27:26.220 --> 05:27:31.900
That's the weird. Oh, that's the weird thing because you are okay. You're timing the blush or something. Hmm

05:27:32.700 --> 05:27:38.220
Um, actually, I should probably you know, I paid a lot. I'm not gonna lie. I paid a lot for all these emotes

05:27:38.620 --> 05:27:42.140
Uh, yeah, man's not using them. Well, I'm just I'm just a bad

05:27:44.940 --> 05:27:48.300
I'm just a bad streamer, but it's fine. It's fine. We work. We do a thing

05:27:49.180 --> 05:27:54.060
But like I'm not being funny. How am I supposed to be mid game? And then like someone goes good girl and I'm like, all right

05:27:54.060 --> 05:27:57.500
Hold on. Hold on. Hold on pause pause the game. Let me just uh, okay

God, it will send a ger a vegemite if you

05:28:06.780 --> 05:28:09.580
We were discussing should we have p.o boxes

05:28:09.660 --> 05:28:12.940
But I said to the girl like it's just far too dangerous on this day and age

05:28:13.260 --> 05:28:15.900
Like with trackers and stuff and there's been so many streamers

05:28:16.540 --> 05:28:18.540

05:29:02.860 --> 05:29:08.220
Okay, let's get out. That was awful. I was literally having to say blame that

05:29:09.580 --> 05:29:11.580
That was terrible. Don't recommend

05:29:15.100 --> 05:29:20.380
Oh, he perished the banshees are pretty hairy out there. You're gonna need the chopper missile online and fast

05:29:20.860 --> 05:29:22.940
Grab new firing circuits from the samson ruckage

05:29:24.380 --> 05:29:27.740
I'm sure regiment wouldn't be considered a bio weapon

05:29:27.740 --> 05:29:29.740
And uh

05:29:31.260 --> 05:29:38.140

Yeah, can you reload please? There's literally an invisible one. He's cheating. Oh my goodness

05:30:06.940 --> 05:30:08.700

Oh, where is he? I hear him

05:30:12.620 --> 05:30:14.380
You don't feel that

05:30:14.380 --> 05:30:17.500
No, you don't feel that that didn't hurt. I know even a little bit

05:30:18.460 --> 05:30:20.300
Jesus

The biggest pet peeve if you give an enemy that can shoot an ally that can shoot but they aren't doing nothing

05:31:01.980 --> 05:31:07.580
Right, am I safe? No, please. Can I enter the cutscene or am I about to get like absolutely mugged in the cutscene?

05:31:08.140 --> 05:31:10.140
Give me

05:31:10.140 --> 05:31:12.140

That should clear up the skies and help Kendra. Hey, you've got to help naga this. Where are you going?

05:31:17.420 --> 05:31:19.420

05:32:21.340 --> 05:32:25.900
This is awful. I'm so sorry the controls are not like straightforward with this

05:32:28.380 --> 05:32:33.660
I'm just trying to see it back in the spray. No, I'm not hitting. Oh, this is terrible

05:32:34.540 --> 05:32:37.100
Close your eyes. Don't look mercy. Don't look you're gonna vomit

05:32:37.980 --> 05:32:41.340
I don't really want to get hurt by that, but I think I'm gonna have to

05:32:44.300 --> 05:32:49.500
Oh, I'm out of like the render distance for it, but there we go. Oh

05:32:50.780 --> 05:32:52.780
Where's the next one?

05:32:53.420 --> 05:32:57.260
Wait, there's one behind me apparently it's right behind me. Uh, no

05:32:58.300 --> 05:33:02.700
We're oh, whoa. Whoa easy easy easy easy. Oh

Oh my god

05:33:10.860 --> 05:33:13.420
Oh, did I do it? No, I got you now

05:33:14.460 --> 05:33:16.460
Where's the Dancino?

05:33:17.100 --> 05:33:20.140
Get me out of this like right now. Seriously

05:33:21.340 --> 05:33:26.940
Go up and then go forward a bit and up and forward and up and forward and up and forward right just up

05:33:27.740 --> 05:33:29.740
And then we'll go just forward. Okay

05:33:30.940 --> 05:33:36.540
Easy easy on the tilt. Why are you it's literally tilting me? I don't know why insist on tilting

05:33:38.060 --> 05:33:44.540
Squishy human versus navi with their carbon fiber reinforced bones. Honestly. Oh my god. I just missed the helipad as well

05:33:45.420 --> 05:33:49.660
Oh, let me sit then get get me out of that. I'm gonna vomit if I'm in that any longer

05:33:50.540 --> 05:33:54.780
You guys can deal with the freaking bad guys because I'm just absolutely rubbish. Get me inside

05:33:55.660 --> 05:33:59.260
You have rockets. Oh, I didn't know. Okay. That might be a bit easier

05:34:00.620 --> 05:34:03.340
I'm holding on good girl. Wait. Why are we thinking?

05:34:07.260 --> 05:34:09.500
Must be because everything wants to hurt you here

05:34:12.620 --> 05:34:14.620
Wounded our inbound

05:34:19.420 --> 05:34:24.060
How's the game so far we've completed the navi and we're doing the bad bad human side now

05:34:24.460 --> 05:34:29.260
I'm going to keep this simple, but I don't know what to expect. I'm pretty scared of that because I've never played this side

05:34:30.460 --> 05:34:33.340
This project starts with you our signal specialist

05:34:34.300 --> 05:34:38.060
This is the sector you're currently in. We need you to go to these three ports

05:34:38.860 --> 05:34:43.820
Once there you must collect small shards of unobtainment. Oh, right. So we're literally doing

05:34:45.020 --> 05:34:47.020
Directly the opposite. I mean that makes sense

05:34:49.340 --> 05:34:56.300
But right now just get those three unobtainium shards. Don't worry too much about the details, writer. We don't have a lot of time

05:34:57.180 --> 05:34:59.180
Okay

05:34:59.980 --> 05:35:01.980
Good Falco out. You heard the man

05:35:03.500 --> 05:35:04.700
Oh

05:35:04.700 --> 05:35:07.260
Okay. Yeah, I have a few questions. All right. I'm out

05:35:08.300 --> 05:35:15.260
Uh, honestly, I'm like leveling up so much. I don't know I can call in I've got weapons up for it as well

05:35:17.740 --> 05:35:19.740
It's trying to hate humans

05:35:24.380 --> 05:35:26.380
We are not humans

05:35:26.780 --> 05:35:29.260
And you make it a lot harder for yourself than it has to be

05:35:29.820 --> 05:35:30.860
Hey

05:35:30.860 --> 05:35:37.020
Look, I'm no very smart. Okay. All right. I think that one will have full health. Where am I? Am I flying? Oh, I'm it's a flying

05:35:38.220 --> 05:35:45.180
That has to be flying. There's no way I can do that on foot. Sorry. There's no way right. Who's ready to get motion sick me?

05:35:47.340 --> 05:35:52.460
Okay, let's first turn to the first wait woman's closest. Yeah, that one is closest

05:35:53.340 --> 05:35:57.900
Okay, first let's get hate so we don't bump into the walls or anything

05:35:58.860 --> 05:36:02.780
Is this the ceiling of the game is wow, we're already at the ceiling. Okay, uh

05:36:04.220 --> 05:36:07.500
Sorry ceiling of the map. My apologies. Hold on

05:36:09.740 --> 05:36:12.940
Whoa, this is like humongous. What? Um

05:36:15.660 --> 05:36:19.900
Oh my god, this is so much harder than driving an ikaran

05:36:20.060 --> 05:36:22.060
Am I looking for

05:36:24.860 --> 05:36:29.260
We're dead plant we're dead part. You know, don't you guys don't have a helipad here?

05:36:30.300 --> 05:36:33.900
Oh, there's navi down there. Oh, I'm gonna get rolled by them. Hold on wait

05:36:33.900 --> 05:36:39.260
I can see transport over here, which makes me think it's safe to put down the chopper here

eight hours if I don't die too much I have successfully completed the Navi

05:45:59.900 --> 05:46:04.140
storyline in this game I'm having to go below because the map isn't letting me

05:46:04.140 --> 05:46:08.100
go above is this a dead end

05:46:09.100 --> 05:46:20.140

05:52:45.420 --> 05:52:51.220
still got some time before the emulators up and running the emulator you don't know

05:52:51.220 --> 05:52:56.220
yet all in good time right now we need to upload that harmonic pop it into the

05:52:56.220 --> 05:53:05.180
module and let's see what we've got okay sure here we go what's happening now what's

05:53:05.180 --> 05:53:10.420
all this stuff for doc yes let me explain the knobby have a unique relationship with

05:53:10.420 --> 05:53:16.660
the plan using a sacred site they're able to link directly with the ecosystem it's

05:53:16.660 --> 05:53:21.100
how they communicate with the entire so we're searching for something different

05:53:21.100 --> 05:53:26.540
our research there is another site that can help us sever the knobby community

05:53:26.540 --> 05:53:35.020
con already has my joy stick place the knobby call the well if we can find this

05:53:35.020 --> 05:53:38.540
old this is why they aren't letting you name any more car honestly I know as a

05:53:39.260 --> 05:53:46.900
I'll never live down from the liberal but honestly best name this is where your harmonics

05:53:46.900 --> 05:53:52.580
come in right we don't know where this dormant site is hi so the harmonic helps you find its

05:53:52.580 --> 05:53:57.460
location I'm actually enjoying these cutscenes because I've never seen them before we can

05:53:57.460 --> 05:54:03.060
triangulate the precise location of the dormant well of soul okay now let's see what your first

05:54:03.060 --> 05:54:05.060
harmonic shows

05:54:07.500 --> 05:54:13.860
excellent did you notice the red dots no those are supposed to be a cutscene with each harmonic

05:54:13.860 --> 05:54:20.260
will reduce the number of red dots cutscene cutscene docu will be our well of soul red dots docu

05:54:20.260 --> 05:54:27.340
you're up for this plan indeed now it's time to check in with commander falco for your next mission

05:54:34.060 --> 05:54:40.060
okay I've got your next mission on deck

05:54:40.060 --> 05:54:46.060
officer midori will meet you fever a new area they really didn't recycle any of the

05:54:46.060 --> 05:54:51.660
map escort you ain't no plumber you'll be good with it and a score oh my god dug it help please

05:54:51.660 --> 05:54:59.780
please dug it help of love uh we can partner in crime for those tree huggers are crying foul over

05:54:59.780 --> 05:55:01.780
this emulator all worried about

05:55:03.380 --> 05:55:09.940
Monroe mentioned that what is this emulator you stay focused on your mission writer you start

05:55:09.940 --> 05:55:17.300
growing the conscience and you'll end up on the dead end of a knobby spear dismiss okay okay falcon

05:55:17.300 --> 05:55:26.020
is your travel to fable hmm that's where they made different maps reach when I genuinely assumed

05:55:26.020 --> 05:55:32.740
it was just gonna be recycled I can't believe it I'm surprised but we've picked up one song so we need

05:55:33.540 --> 05:55:38.980
two more songs and then I assume the third we destroy it or the navi destroy it before we get

05:55:38.980 --> 05:55:47.220
it so it's like literally a complete hundred I could flip yeah words and stuff um hello please

05:56:05.940 --> 05:56:09.700
are you disappointed that they didn't reuse assets since you know the RDA

05:56:10.660 --> 05:56:17.220
period now I'm just a surprise like I just assumed the opposite was going to be the same

05:56:17.220 --> 05:56:24.100
maps but we're attacking from a different side but just watch yourself out there I'll drop you

05:56:24.100 --> 05:56:28.660
at the load with midoring I'm being so fuel I'll catch you on the other side

05:56:32.260 --> 05:56:38.980
well back into the free let's unlock this teleport first and then get assigned or

05:56:38.980 --> 05:56:44.100
quest from Kendra welcome to the fever you need to link up with our forward units

05:56:44.100 --> 05:56:49.380
they've got orders to secure your shards be careful these guys are in that's what it was

05:56:52.100 --> 05:56:55.140
I was I was wondering why the voice sense so familiar

05:56:58.180 --> 05:57:00.980
kind of sad they put so much effort into it didn't get much traction

05:57:04.340 --> 05:57:07.780
I think in 2.7 million sales you made your money back though

05:57:09.380 --> 05:57:17.220
so investors can't feel too bad I think I don't know if like avatar because when the

05:57:17.220 --> 05:57:23.060

06:00:54.580 --> 06:00:59.060
I can hear it get closer to me I'm vertical though what you're gonna do about it nothing

06:00:59.940 --> 06:01:06.580

06:05:45.140 --> 06:05:50.740
merci modis is going live in t-minus three hours at the moment we are playing a game known as

06:05:50.740 --> 06:05:56.180
James Cameron's avatar which is childhood game of mine we have finished the navi quest line and now

06:05:56.180 --> 06:06:02.500
we are playing as the bad guys I am absolutely terrified of genuinely fighting the um

06:06:02.980 --> 06:06:13.540
the navi um so we are just trying our best to get through the quest line as fast as possible

06:06:13.540 --> 06:06:22.260
with the least amount of spikes as possible and the game has aged a little bit in terms of like

06:06:22.260 --> 06:06:26.180
I don't know what they were thinking these camera angles and stuff why does that look like it's

06:06:26.180 --> 06:06:31.780
gonna wallop down on me as I go past it I saw that I can that is horrific I've not seen that

06:06:32.900 --> 06:06:37.380
oh there's noises being made oh there's navi standing up okay that's why that's why

06:06:39.060 --> 06:06:45.060
we're just gonna keep driving to objective and everything's gonna be all right and we're

06:06:45.060 --> 06:06:51.860
totally not playing horror game simulator at all honestly this is terrifying as a human oh please

06:06:51.860 --> 06:06:59.540
let me roll you over please don't get back up again oh please mr rocks don't ruin this I don't

06:06:59.620 --> 06:07:08.740

lanky and scary and their arms are so long and whoa getting shivers just right we've got

06:08:48.900 --> 06:08:54.340

06:09:05.300 --> 06:09:14.500
this game actually looks well made for a movie I don't want to really write that that's literally

06:09:14.500 --> 06:09:19.780
gonna oh my god but to take all of that on foot with all the navi is terrifying

06:09:33.780 --> 06:09:39.620

06:09:57.460 --> 06:10:03.700
I was not even like explode out just perish

06:10:05.620 --> 06:10:12.580
well let's not do that again I guess so I have to do this on foot and be absolutely mortified

06:10:12.580 --> 06:10:17.620
the entire time let me put on the protection spell that was the dumbest thing I've ever seen

06:10:17.620 --> 06:10:24.820

06:10:35.620 --> 06:10:47.700
quite a long time right that's okay that's okay I'm a big girl and this isn't scary to me at all

06:10:47.700 --> 06:10:54.900
I'm not absolutely terrified and there's not a bit of pee ready to come flying out of me once I get

06:10:54.900 --> 06:11:03.940
jump scared we're cutting it we're cutting it short we are cutting it short I have to admit

06:11:03.940 --> 06:11:11.940

06:11:11.940 --> 06:11:16.900
thing I don't know what the heck it does I feel like it's gonna slam down on me and I just want to

06:11:16.980 --> 06:11:17.860
confirm or deny

06:11:22.980 --> 06:11:24.980

06:11:36.420 --> 06:11:46.180
not tons of navi ahead I'll need these don't raid a flaming cart I think it's okay it's okay

06:11:47.220 --> 06:12:02.980

06:12:39.380 --> 06:12:46.980
looming please no navi I did say please but I understand

06:12:51.940 --> 06:12:57.140
wait wait wait there's a tail look for survivors wait looking good

06:13:00.580 --> 06:13:05.780
cleaning zenos for xp is always a perfect plan yeah I'm thinking maybe if I find a turret I might try

06:13:06.340 --> 06:13:06.900
level up

06:13:10.340 --> 06:13:14.340
if that hammerhead taught us anything is that you ain't got enough damage for bosses

06:13:14.340 --> 06:13:23.780
monkey ass are you implying there's a boss ahead monkey ass because I I don't I don't know

06:14:05.140 --> 06:14:09.860
even navi had bosses like those dudes that took a lot of killing now imagine the reverse

06:14:10.660 --> 06:14:15.860
what does monkey ass mean it's a twitch emote where you look really stressed out and like oh no

06:14:15.860 --> 06:14:22.580

you're getting jumped by a pack of wolves you'll be okay

06:14:48.660 --> 06:14:57.700

06:15:23.060 --> 06:15:28.420

06:15:33.380 --> 06:15:40.900
oh forget it we hate nature literally what

06:15:43.380 --> 06:15:47.700
it seems like there's more soldiers placed everywhere though maybe to help you through it

06:15:47.700 --> 06:15:52.740

06:19:54.340 --> 06:19:58.500
I'm just gonna let them attack and hope they don't keep respawning

06:20:00.820 --> 06:20:10.180
and then it's safe to come out okay okay okay now hold on hold on all is not lost this might not

06:20:10.180 --> 06:20:17.220
be the most painful gameplay of rda side you've ever seen it's called tools pa

06:20:24.020 --> 06:20:25.860

maybe that whoa these whoa whoa whoa whoa these flies are stun locking me

06:36:29.220 --> 06:36:32.820
sorry guys I'm gonna leave you behind to get absolutely annihilated because I don't want to

06:36:32.820 --> 06:36:39.380
deal with that did I don't know if that card game encryption has hypno in it I don't I don't

06:36:39.460 --> 06:36:43.700
know if I'm just making that up I I've not played it myself I think I've like paused for like two

06:36:43.700 --> 06:36:55.140
milliseconds uh to see huh whoa whoa whoa skipping watching my usual streamers for Sony

06:36:55.140 --> 06:37:01.460
does a new approach you I am an endurance streamer so if this is not your kind of game don't worry

06:37:01.460 --> 06:37:10.420
Mercy is going live in T minus two and a half I have never been happier to see these these guys

06:37:10.420 --> 06:37:15.620
wherever the heck they're what are they called let's see what they're called don't move a UT drone

06:37:15.620 --> 06:37:25.380
I've never been so happy to see a UT drone oh depends if you go the other route okay yeah

06:37:25.460 --> 06:37:31.140
the alternative stuff yet definitely there's not an inscription okay I misremember

06:37:36.260 --> 06:37:40.180
oh I'm so stressed playing this yeah I'm not even pretending okay I really appreciate

06:37:40.180 --> 06:37:45.300
that I already went to the ocarina time skull trainer we need to hurry tensions are starting to boil

06:37:45.300 --> 06:37:51.940
over at hell's gate oh I'll be just puked up in the verge of declaring martial law he's starting

06:37:52.020 --> 06:37:57.380
to invite scientists for questioning I'm not sure what he's nervous about we need to be careful

06:37:58.100 --> 06:38:06.820
if the time comes we may need to make some tough choices so Kendra wants you to report to Monroe

06:38:06.820 --> 06:38:12.820
at hell's gate if you're gonna give me 8000 xp for showing up sure I'll go to hell's gate pretty

06:38:12.820 --> 06:38:20.340
sure there are lots of sections of everything in vampires the masquerade and destroy all humans

06:38:20.340 --> 06:38:27.380
have hypnosis wait vampires masquerade do you get to play as a vampire that hypnotizes people that

06:38:27.380 --> 06:38:35.460
would be kind of cool oh my god I'm here for that oh okay I feel like we level up so fast

06:38:35.460 --> 06:38:43.460
this rda maybe the rda isn't as long I think so oh that's so cool maybe we'll take a look at that

06:38:43.460 --> 06:38:49.700
I've never played it or seen any gameplay of it but uh is that like a highly rated game

06:38:52.020 --> 06:38:59.860
dark souls 3 has rapport for anime potential I suppose I mean technically more door shadow

06:38:59.860 --> 06:39:06.980
and more door you can take technically like imprint enemies so they're not mean to you all right

06:39:06.980 --> 06:39:11.860
upload the harmonic I'm behind on my doomsday diagnostic this is the second song wrong with the

06:39:11.860 --> 06:39:17.860
emulator we could have an ecological meltdown okay let's hold up a sec what the hell is this emulator

06:39:19.060 --> 06:39:24.580
yes the emulator we're searching for a dormant well of souls right now once we find it we need to

06:39:24.580 --> 06:39:31.460
communicate oh they're pretending being called a first voice he's the only person who can awake

06:39:31.460 --> 06:39:40.180
in a well of souls they're pretending that the emulator isn't just a nuke once that's done

06:39:40.260 --> 06:39:46.820
we can control the entire ecosystem so back to that first ecosystem you're going to do a diagnostic

06:39:47.620 --> 06:39:53.700
well hey everything has its risk come now upload that harm they're lying to me not

06:39:55.220 --> 06:39:59.620
but we're still going to nuke the planet anyway once they're closer depending on the location of

06:39:59.620 --> 06:40:04.500
the dormant site you should check in with the man who doesn't in fact have the option to be a hypnotic

06:40:05.460 --> 06:40:09.620
and highly rated as a question it's a cult classic oh my apology I did not know that

06:40:14.900 --> 06:40:21.540
it's good might need to mess with it a little to make it work though it's an old game oh yeah

06:40:21.540 --> 06:40:26.740
doesn't Baldur's Gate have a bunch of them I'm not playing Big Baldi's Gate yet

06:40:27.220 --> 06:40:32.500
scenario don't start growing a brain it says it's corp is it like corp that can bring you get

06:40:32.500 --> 06:40:38.500
you guys in and out or is it another kind of corp the human colony and avatar is pretty impressive

06:40:38.820 --> 06:40:43.540
that emulators are one hope Baldur's Gate has tons of main controls especially because main

06:40:43.540 --> 06:40:48.980
flyers are a big part of the plot hmm doesn't have main control of the game

06:40:50.580 --> 06:40:57.940
it's quite a vtm vampire's masquerades old game it's not that kind of cool one we're going to

06:40:57.940 --> 06:41:08.020
Graves Bog okay did you know that in scots the bog is slang for the toilet did you know that in

06:41:08.020 --> 06:41:14.740
Australia the thunderbox is slang for the toilet I don't know what any slang for any other

oh new scary location oh me oh my

06:41:38.020 --> 06:41:42.340
I mean Baldur's Gate has twitch integration oh that's a shame there's no such thing

06:50:57.060 --> 06:51:02.900
buy it it's the experiences for me is more nostalgia although this part is like actually

06:51:03.780 --> 06:51:06.740
like I'm actually like having a challenge playing this part

06:51:08.500 --> 06:51:14.820
I'm still in disbelief the game even exists your hands are on the controller

06:51:14.820 --> 06:51:19.380

06:51:33.860 --> 06:51:38.580
I'm sure by the way you missed the cutscene gate flying like a rocket launcher honestly

06:51:39.860 --> 06:51:47.060
yeah you leveled so far I wonder if the rda mission is actually like smaller than the main

06:51:48.580 --> 06:51:55.220

oh that's like just a little deafening

06:53:06.500 --> 06:53:09.860
okay this just looks like an XP farm run I'm gonna say it but

06:53:11.700 --> 06:53:13.940

06:53:17.780 --> 06:53:26.340

I just get stressed when I'm playing the bad guys and everything's all skewed

06:55:32.660 --> 06:55:34.900
and I'm sorry if I skewed

06:55:42.340 --> 06:55:43.700
oh I don't want that to break

06:55:46.900 --> 06:55:48.420
she's doing her best for humanity

06:55:50.500 --> 06:55:55.060
absolutely denying it denying it sorry destroying it

06:55:58.980 --> 06:56:00.180
if I'm getting xp

06:56:03.060 --> 06:56:06.900
the first things are running away

06:56:12.580 --> 06:56:16.820
that's my car that's small that's one of more guys my oh I even know

06:56:19.700 --> 06:56:25.860
oh first things I just feel bad I feel like we're we're entering a zoo and then just executing

06:56:25.860 --> 06:56:31.460
all the animals inside the zoo this is what this run feels like honestly

06:56:33.220 --> 06:56:34.980
like they're literally running away now

06:56:41.060 --> 06:56:43.940
oh for xp so I can unlock a new armor why not

06:56:50.100 --> 06:56:51.220
perish that plan

06:56:53.380 --> 06:56:54.740
in front are you don't oh

06:56:57.540 --> 06:56:58.580
is that supposed to happen

06:57:02.900 --> 06:57:08.660
what a unique game mode to say the least I think you see about three of these guys

06:57:08.660 --> 06:57:13.620
if you play navi and you see 100 on this one section of the game alone

06:57:19.540 --> 06:57:21.300
we're strum beast pulling

06:57:23.140 --> 06:57:26.100
it's what it's been oh my god that was

06:57:28.020 --> 06:57:32.020
that was a slaughter I'm not even happy with that that was awful

06:57:32.820 --> 06:57:39.300
you're a lifesaver you're a lifesaver how about that strike stubby stakes all around okay the

06:57:39.300 --> 06:57:45.540
second shards right in this sector go grab it and report back to me and the third I'm working on it

06:57:45.540 --> 06:57:50.260
radios are toast everything slower here this is why the navi section has so few human

06:57:51.140 --> 06:57:59.940
campaign colors them now you know why you don't see them in this oh is it like all this damage

06:57:59.940 --> 06:58:02.900
has been done and we're just coming at the back end of it

06:58:05.220 --> 06:58:08.260
oh that actually makes so much sense

06:58:11.460 --> 06:58:16.260
and we're basic we basically come in when they're like at the end of the losing fight and we turn

06:58:16.260 --> 06:58:28.260
the tide okay oh my god that's so smart I didn't give the devs team like as much benefit as a doubt

06:58:28.340 --> 06:58:29.220
but that's so smart

06:58:32.420 --> 06:58:36.660
don't let him I was gonna say don't let him kill you because he's gonna aggro to me and I can just tell

06:58:36.660 --> 06:58:42.020
you is oh wait hold on where I'm trying to go hold on a minute let me pick

06:58:43.860 --> 06:58:50.900
there we go I'll just let him get in the back thing what new drift would be got um wait I think

06:58:50.900 --> 06:58:54.820
we're about to unlock the new one because now our arms are on show and I'm like that's the opposite

06:58:54.820 --> 06:59:01.540
of what our it does the hero maybe oh no clue if it's kind of it's just a joke of mine I mean it

06:59:01.540 --> 06:59:09.540
maybe because literally you only see two of them right where we need to go well I'm taking a car

06:59:09.540 --> 06:59:19.860
for that I'm not taking that back thing can I drive this oh can draw how do I shoot I don't know

06:59:19.940 --> 06:59:25.940
can I drive him over oh that was I was actually really mean I shouldn't have come up I kind of

06:59:25.940 --> 06:59:30.420
deserved it what are all those things are those reports

06:59:32.980 --> 06:59:40.660
um so can I not shoot I don't think I can I think I can only drive we're driving this buggy

06:59:41.220 --> 06:59:46.980
oh that's like such a long way to go I'll go on the outskirts to get the

06:59:49.860 --> 06:59:55.060
uh like uncovered map thing actually smash them against the wall

06:59:56.900 --> 06:59:59.620
oh I can't go that way

07:00:02.020 --> 07:00:07.540
this is so much more responsive than the buggy I have to admit I like that they make that differentiation

07:00:11.220 --> 07:00:18.500
uh okay we can't go this way I thought we couldn't come through the way the map made it look but we

07:00:19.380 --> 07:00:32.980
no I did not just do that oh I did not just do that oh I freaking did oh no no no hello game oh my gosh

07:00:33.380 --> 07:00:40.340
oh this is the worst thing that could have happened has not happened

07:00:41.700 --> 07:00:48.500
door stuck literally door stuck oh and I have to do all of this on foot whilst everything is aggressive

07:00:48.500 --> 07:00:54.900
to me right how much further do I have to go just a wee bit for it just down the street

07:00:54.900 --> 07:00:59.300
it's fine I just need to pop down the street it's like going to the corner shop it's just around

07:00:59.380 --> 07:01:06.980
the corner it's okay you can just teleport down I can't because I've not unlocked whatever it is

07:01:06.980 --> 07:01:15.780
it's not unlocked is it quiet is it safe question mark other than the fly trap

07:01:17.380 --> 07:01:23.860
just a wee bit more all is good this is called sniper's point implying that they're

07:01:23.860 --> 07:01:32.180
sniper navi looking at me right now question mark the ho hum okay whoa whoa whoa something's

07:01:32.180 --> 07:01:40.500
getting me I don't want a fly a fly got me a mosquito a mosquito got me oh whoa look at it freaking

07:01:40.500 --> 07:01:47.700
ready to like get me all right I'll wait until my inverse comes back yeah yeah that's right go

07:01:47.700 --> 07:01:55.060
back to sleep give me a stinky stinky plant don't like you abandoned rda camp well that doesn't

07:01:55.700 --> 07:02:01.780
that doesn't this is this this is not good for me I can tell you that much this is absolutely

07:02:01.780 --> 07:02:07.940
awful for me um I will take the teleport point just so I don't have to do that again um

07:02:08.740 --> 07:02:17.860
um can I hide here well he looks pretty enraged to me um

07:02:20.420 --> 07:02:24.340
I have nowhere I'm gonna go up oh no I can't go up I'm too small

07:02:26.660 --> 07:02:33.460
where where's the crystal guys I don't really want to go abandon hope yo you who may enter

07:02:33.540 --> 07:02:40.580
on the floor finger it's about hole oh there's this to spray them down

07:02:42.580 --> 07:02:45.220
hmm okay

07:02:51.860 --> 07:02:53.380
did they just run away from me now

07:02:54.260 --> 07:03:05.620
okay okay not too bad if I have a too little really destroy all this stuff too I mean it's

07:03:05.620 --> 07:03:12.180
10 xp I'm not really sure it's worth taking the time to do that I will try and clear up this area

07:03:12.180 --> 07:03:16.900
because if I'm to like try and find a crystal in the middle we're still free jumping I don't even know

07:03:17.460 --> 07:03:19.460
what I'm supposed to look

07:03:21.060 --> 07:03:26.660
oh now you come around the corner no you're such a liar you're actually such a liar you're telling

07:03:26.660 --> 07:03:33.620
fivers why would you come around the corner now after I'd already sprayed you where on earth is this

07:03:34.500 --> 07:03:40.900
thing and he's already AI locked on me I don't know why the game pretends otherwise

07:03:41.780 --> 07:03:47.140
is there another turret over here that I can use I know the things back in that other section

07:03:47.140 --> 07:03:54.260
I'm just wondering what's up here why is there a dead end oh and it's just like one of these things

07:03:54.260 --> 07:04:02.100
jeez that gorilla and you're a lifesaver it's just abandon kind of showing you it's old

07:04:02.100 --> 07:04:13.220
abandoned hope you know dog pet dog it's a turtle I have no idea with pecking crystals

07:04:16.260 --> 07:04:23.220
already I go to me but I can't see maybe inside that building and that's why it's like flashing

07:04:23.220 --> 07:04:27.220
here

07:04:31.300 --> 07:04:32.020
oh pardon me

07:04:35.060 --> 07:04:39.620
wait I'm gonna go invisible and see if I can shoot it from that turret or is it already

07:04:39.620 --> 07:04:46.100
glued on to me no uh was it in here

07:04:46.260 --> 07:04:52.740
bro where is this freaking cell sample I don't know

07:04:54.820 --> 07:04:59.700
I'm gonna see if I can get rid of that last guy with us because he I just saw a second one

07:05:01.700 --> 07:05:06.980
wait let's get rid of you because you're in my way you're in my way you're in my way

07:05:07.860 --> 07:05:17.140
right no I think wherever the heck it is it's somewhere over here it's not been here yet

07:05:26.820 --> 07:05:33.140
I hate you what even if you're invisible oh he's got protection prayer on I can see it that's what

07:05:33.140 --> 07:05:44.580
that bloom boy here oh I just what did I get I got new armor and speed four I'll take that

07:05:47.300 --> 07:05:49.620

07:05:52.900 --> 07:05:55.620
that was big oh a different outfit I'm like

07:05:56.180 --> 07:06:02.420

no don't spray on me no it's not time for that

07:06:28.660 --> 07:06:33.780
hello we're currently looking for something that my blind eyes cannot perceive

07:06:37.700 --> 07:06:42.180
it says it's somewhere in this area and I keep perfectly avoiding it wherever it is

07:06:43.140 --> 07:06:50.580
okay um now the avatars are coming in this area is it inside that maybe maybe it's inside

07:06:50.580 --> 07:06:58.660
this one whatever it is it's in the building oh if it's in this one I'm gonna be mad because

07:06:58.660 --> 07:07:04.180
I went in the other one oh for goodness gravy thank you what are the odds

07:07:06.340 --> 07:07:10.900
right finally got there in the end and there of course there's not fast travel to that guy

07:07:10.900 --> 07:07:12.180
because that would be too easy wouldn't that

07:07:15.700 --> 07:07:19.860
uh that speed is fast though like I'm pretty speed

07:07:21.860 --> 07:07:24.020
of course it was in the building that I wasn't looking at

07:07:25.220 --> 07:07:28.500
how could I be such a silly sausage I was beating up my car

07:07:30.740 --> 07:07:36.740
yeah I had to put a down payment on that right this is gonna be off topic I don't know if you

07:07:36.740 --> 07:07:43.380
guys have been watching a there's this youtuber that looks at people's finances like for entertainment

07:07:43.940 --> 07:07:50.340
but he always shouts at them for having a car and I didn't realize that a car loans were like

07:07:50.340 --> 07:07:56.260
really predatory in America and where they like make you pay like a ridiculous like percentage

07:07:56.260 --> 07:08:03.300
and stuff whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa you just relax little flies you just relax thank you thank you

07:08:03.300 --> 07:08:06.580

better on me honestly I want you to collect the shard from a nearby navvy village okay let's give

07:08:24.260 --> 07:08:32.900
it a shot I believe this is the second last shard collection map and then we've done the

07:08:32.900 --> 07:08:45.940
campaign unbelievably uh we are just going for it I love being ignored in battle yay I love going

07:08:45.940 --> 07:08:55.460
so fast that the enemies don't target me yay I love not being a part of the fight ow he just spanked

07:08:55.460 --> 07:09:04.180
my boat good night rest well those who need to sleep uh sorry about kind of the surprise endurance

just to watch the vaude will be remaining for you soon tm

07:09:32.100 --> 07:09:36.100
you must kill tan jala before you collect the harmonic and the willow tree where we've got a

07:09:36.100 --> 07:09:42.660
boss fight but we can do it we can do it we can do it if we put our mind to uh we can do

07:09:43.220 --> 07:09:46.260
we're um Eric I'm not trying to go I'm behind a tent right now

07:09:48.100 --> 07:09:54.500
living up to the endurance streamer tag enemy yeah I wonder how many people

07:09:55.300 --> 07:10:03.540
didn't realize like when I said endurance streamer I meant endurance strummer okay

07:10:04.980 --> 07:10:08.500
right what am I doing just kind of kind of half follow the map

07:10:09.460 --> 07:10:13.060
oh oh I'm in the battle field by accident

07:10:17.060 --> 07:10:18.660
strummer look at his tail

07:10:22.580 --> 07:10:24.820
tan jala near me watch pride

07:10:26.660 --> 07:10:36.340
look at my speed my speed is amazing I'm a super soldier hmm it tastes like reasons

07:10:38.900 --> 07:10:41.060
I was surprised but I haven't missed them how

07:10:45.460 --> 07:10:51.140
I have streamed a heck of a lot of time I feel like maybe right or tan jala's been spotted near

07:10:51.140 --> 07:10:56.100
the willow tree it's like he's waiting there waiting for you I think watch yourself

07:11:00.740 --> 07:11:04.900
I can't even see the enemy you know that I actually can't eat I'm not being funny

07:11:05.460 --> 07:11:10.980
I didn't mean to good battle but if I genuinely can't see the freaking enemy what are you wanting

07:11:10.980 --> 07:11:19.460
me to do oh no way I've just engaged the freaking boss fight stop stop I've engaged the boss fight

07:11:19.460 --> 07:11:27.940
and there's like a literally a billion you're gonna make me pay myself please oh my god I think I

07:11:27.940 --> 07:11:33.380
need flamethrower to like oh my god I'm just getting absolutely gang violence here what am I supposed

07:11:35.220 --> 07:11:41.620
I need I need pop malts I need pop malts like right now they're all using freaking prayer

07:11:41.620 --> 07:11:47.460
protection I'm out of mana I'm out of mana I actually can't do prayer protection because I'm

07:11:47.460 --> 07:11:53.780
out of mana when I'm running out of freaking strength potion as if we were playing rescape

07:11:54.340 --> 07:12:02.900
right now oh my gosh what have I done what have I done what have I done I've just dived into the

07:12:02.900 --> 07:12:09.860
enemy I like literally can't see them prep the time oh and there's someone sniping me from behind

07:12:09.860 --> 07:12:17.780
as well not sorry but no it's just no on like you can't even just snake me from halfway across the

07:12:17.780 --> 07:12:28.660
map and why did that one run away I have no idea I guess I'm at range whatever the sniper one is

07:12:28.740 --> 07:12:35.060
still wound for me but at least that other one ran away okay that's the problem I have with the

07:12:35.060 --> 07:12:42.500
snipers they can do that yes thank you for coming freaking point blank why oh wow Tanjala pushed me

07:12:42.500 --> 07:12:52.020
so far out of his battle area he had literally DC no I can see that other NPC though can I shoot him

07:12:52.820 --> 07:12:59.780
oh that's the flamethrower darling that's the shotgun can I I just want him there we go

07:13:03.860 --> 07:13:06.500
I just wanted him to attack me no one else

07:13:09.780 --> 07:13:16.340
okay let's let's take it nice and easy nice and easy she says that she gets caught in trees

07:13:16.980 --> 07:13:23.860
no that no shotgun shotgun no no no no no no I missed okay this is what I want

07:13:24.740 --> 07:13:31.700
the shotgun stagger is exactly what I'm looking for right now it can be what what's the name of

07:13:31.700 --> 07:13:38.260
shotgun so it can be a spaz 12 is the name of a shotgun a stakeout is the name of a shotgun

07:13:39.220 --> 07:13:44.180
oh they're gun I don't remember any other ones off the top of my head

07:13:45.620 --> 07:13:49.140
not very good with gun names unless they're in black ops one and all on us too

07:13:49.940 --> 07:14:04.340
like Famous AK-47 submachine guns Susie's AK-47 new um MP5 very classic normally shown in movies

07:14:04.420 --> 07:14:11.700
mp5 k brian I have returned from the job strongy hope it's going well we're currently doing a

07:14:11.700 --> 07:14:20.820
boss battle and I'm getting absolutely wrecked tiny spiny but I can only do as much as I can

07:14:21.380 --> 07:14:27.380
it's taking a while I don't know I feel like maybe there's something I should know like maybe I

07:14:27.380 --> 07:14:34.420
should be in a mech at this point it's very plausible um but thank you for the ship we're

07:14:34.420 --> 07:14:40.980
getting there he's just cast protection sorry I like I don't want to waste the ammo since I've

07:14:40.980 --> 07:14:48.500
a little bit too left like stop with the prayer protection whoa whoa whoa okay I'm out of that

07:14:48.500 --> 07:14:54.180
so next is flamethrower we're just gonna no he gets so close when I do flamethrower like so close

07:14:54.580 --> 07:15:02.100
is he got fury on so he does double damage to me I think so I think that's what that was

07:15:03.700 --> 07:15:07.620
right we're just gonna have to do it seems he staggers with the assault right

07:18:37.060 --> 07:18:42.500
PSN account or something just to play the game even though they advertised like

07:18:43.540 --> 07:18:46.740
you can still play your game even without the PSN part

07:18:49.140 --> 07:18:50.100

07:34:59.220 --> 07:35:00.900
spun about in this game you know that

07:35:02.820 --> 07:35:08.180

I don't know how I perish from that but what whatever right so that's a crossing right so

07:36:21.700 --> 07:36:23.700

um

07:38:45.460 --> 07:38:48.820

please try not to blow yourself up

07:38:57.300 --> 07:39:00.900

07:39:12.580 --> 07:39:18.260
blocked me from moving in the first place hardy hardy hard very funny already freaking

07:39:19.460 --> 07:39:21.700
that's not supposed to happen what was it

07:39:25.780 --> 07:39:31.140
what am I getting shot by that's nice oh this game's trawling me

07:39:31.940 --> 07:39:35.700
sounds like we've got company seems like we've got company

07:39:37.220 --> 07:39:42.660
I don't like the sounds too many vital words it's going to be some way to slow them down

07:39:42.660 --> 07:39:45.140
I'm on it it's got to be some way to slow them down

07:39:46.660 --> 07:39:53.620
uh okay we're on your mark oh we're almost there hold on hold on for me you're so close

07:39:53.620 --> 07:39:56.260
right I've got healing four that's what I like to see

07:39:58.180 --> 07:40:00.660
let us put down these

07:40:04.020 --> 07:40:09.220
oh is that a bomb oh that's a bomb has to be bombed anyway me that's supposed to be bomb yeah

07:40:12.900 --> 07:40:16.500
all right the bomb did activate even though I did it like that at the same time

07:40:20.660 --> 07:40:23.540
okay okay just to do it one more time one more time

07:40:29.060 --> 07:40:32.340
it's okay it's okay right they're both they're both

07:40:33.780 --> 07:40:35.540
wow I'm getting slowed down by the

07:40:38.180 --> 07:40:39.860
enough enough enough I'm getting slowed down

07:40:40.740 --> 07:40:42.740
oh

07:40:45.780 --> 07:40:47.220
that's all right you just want to spend more time

07:40:48.980 --> 07:40:51.940
yeah see how you journey you have to say you're over you know you're still

07:40:52.900 --> 07:40:54.100
running through the dank thing

07:40:57.380 --> 07:40:58.340
but how about that

07:41:00.340 --> 07:41:01.940
half the gears all day gone on

07:41:03.860 --> 07:41:04.740
hydration check

07:41:10.740 --> 07:41:15.460
when there's orders to fill the power cell in the system reactivate the thing

07:41:16.980 --> 07:41:21.620
okay I'm analyzing the map so I can basically go everywhere

07:41:22.660 --> 07:41:27.460
I just got the sweep since I was looking at it dog was getting shot in the background

07:41:27.460 --> 07:41:28.580
literally the purvy thing

07:41:30.340 --> 07:41:32.100
it's no therefore they spawned on time

07:41:32.180 --> 07:41:34.340
uh

07:41:36.980 --> 07:41:41.220
me oh it's such a shame purvy dogs also me the dogs won't leave me alone

07:41:42.340 --> 07:41:49.060
I've had enough no that's too many no that's one too many so that's actually one too many

07:41:49.060 --> 07:41:53.380
that's three too many if any more come at me I'm actually be region

07:41:54.420 --> 07:41:57.940
this is too much how are you supposed to genuinely do this like

07:41:57.940 --> 07:42:01.220
does the devs expect you to pause and do this every single time

07:42:01.940 --> 07:42:05.940
there's no way I'm getting bit to death though

07:42:07.860 --> 07:42:12.020
there's no way in heck I refuse I refuse

07:42:13.940 --> 07:42:18.020
then we're gonna get spat on by the flies and then there's mere dogs

07:42:21.300 --> 07:42:26.020
okay I somehow am making it do I need to take a little to the

07:42:26.580 --> 07:42:30.100
okay I need to drop the buggy when I get ahead here

07:42:31.460 --> 07:42:34.740
and then I'll have gone through the section pretty quickly

07:42:42.020 --> 07:42:46.500
there okay we're all good again that is a pretty plan I honestly

07:42:48.980 --> 07:42:50.260
I'm surprised I can

07:42:52.660 --> 07:42:52.980
wow

07:42:52.980 --> 07:42:58.100
okay there's allies ahead that's all I could see

07:43:02.340 --> 07:43:06.260
mate you're just letting that plant absolutely decimate you for no reason

07:43:09.700 --> 07:43:15.700
okay this is like so much easier can you actually burn the plants you know that oh wait wait wait

07:43:15.700 --> 07:43:16.900
it's too many too many dogs

07:43:17.060 --> 07:43:27.300
why are there so many multi-different colors but when you play like the navi side where you're

07:43:27.300 --> 07:43:32.500
supposed to like be appreciating nature and stuff it's just like

07:43:37.380 --> 07:43:43.060
if I have the backtrack one more time right thankfully I can teleport here

07:43:44.020 --> 07:43:49.220
you make me backtrack one more time game I'm gonna have it out for you then I'll make myself clear

07:44:04.900 --> 07:44:07.940
we surely must be getting back up soon with this one

07:44:08.740 --> 07:44:12.580
I feel like we grabbed all the songs so what now

07:44:17.220 --> 07:44:19.380
so we're to get in hard for deeds

07:44:24.580 --> 07:44:28.020
um the navi side did the game is good the rda side

07:44:29.620 --> 07:44:36.980
I'm just wanting it to be over with it's too hard like I'm genuinely hard no I'm not hard

07:44:36.980 --> 07:44:40.020
sorry the game is genuinely hard on the rda side

07:44:46.340 --> 07:44:49.300
okay so Kendra's got in doubts of what the thing is

07:44:56.020 --> 07:44:58.100
and I don't mean I don't mean that um

07:45:00.020 --> 07:45:04.340
so when we get the offer

07:45:04.420 --> 07:45:13.860
why is it sending me this map is a nightmare to navigate I'm not being funny

07:45:15.300 --> 07:45:21.300
this is probably one of the hardest maps this no this will this will be the hardest map ever

07:45:23.220 --> 07:45:28.340
that I've had to navigate and do all this stuff and I don't even know where to start maybe the one

07:45:28.340 --> 07:45:35.940
to my left if I take a left and then before no if I take a left and then take a right

07:45:38.340 --> 07:45:42.180
this is the filter for the human campaign literally like

07:45:44.020 --> 07:45:51.060
it's getting rough it's getting rough being like told to go and I know they provide transport

07:45:51.060 --> 07:45:58.740
via the the mechs and the the buggies and that but if you're going to do it that your buggy health

07:45:58.740 --> 07:46:04.820
makes you explode and you have to reload there's no point in providing that kind of thing like it's

07:46:04.820 --> 07:46:13.700
just name is gonna be wait if I can okay I can resurrect I need to take the first right though

07:46:13.700 --> 07:46:21.940
I can resurrect but it's fine oh please don't I'm gonna run out of hiding

07:46:26.420 --> 07:46:33.380
I am running for my life I didn't even know they were going to do Thanos in the middle no no

07:46:34.260 --> 07:46:39.700
please leave me alone please I ask kindly and respectfully to respect my space

07:46:39.700 --> 07:46:48.980
I very kindly ask you to respect my social distance social distance please I don't know if

07:46:48.980 --> 07:46:55.460
you've seen that Scottish meme where the guy goes social distance please but you said it so politely

07:46:57.940 --> 07:47:06.180
I'm I'm just hauling ass there's no way I'd make this without oh right where's it up here to be honest

07:47:06.820 --> 07:47:12.740
okay this is actually okay I'll give the game devs something this is actually kind of cool I like

07:47:12.740 --> 07:47:23.140
the classic like spiral up something I'll see it I'll see it whoa lovely lovely thank you devs

07:47:23.140 --> 07:47:28.260
thank you devs for putting a crack in the fricked rock stairwell I'll take everything I said back

07:47:28.260 --> 07:47:36.420
about this design take it all back random gap in the stairwell whilst you're getting

07:47:36.420 --> 07:47:41.860
whacked by Navi and the dogs are biting your ankles at the bottom of the rock face and things

07:47:41.860 --> 07:47:48.900
are exploding there's like an exploding plan that's aiming on me right now that's what that is oh

07:47:49.300 --> 07:47:56.580
speaking of exploding plans here's the bam himself yeah yeah yeah yeah okay right

07:47:59.060 --> 07:48:04.820
I am now going to use that teleport to go back to that wiggly one up there

07:48:07.700 --> 07:48:07.940
no

07:48:19.860 --> 07:48:28.100
I'm losing the will to live just get me out of here right um take if I go here and I take a

07:48:28.100 --> 07:48:35.220

07:49:57.220 --> 07:50:03.780
what about McCree I already chose McCree right what's your idea should have been

07:50:04.580 --> 07:50:13.380
any other uh right if I come back Lily I came from I can hit whatever that big sector is

07:50:14.900 --> 07:50:24.900
I assume this has to be the last mission like this is for map design uh for map oh maybe not

07:50:24.900 --> 07:50:29.220
right now whilst like all the navi are on my butthole that'd be great not to get some luck

07:50:30.180 --> 07:50:41.140

07:50:41.140 --> 07:50:48.580

who wrote this game I'd say I can rate better but that's not true oh no I have to go all the way around

07:56:21.380 --> 07:56:31.860
to get down there there's no way to fall down there safely well well I need to do a big old U-turn

07:56:32.980 --> 07:56:40.660
do you hate the navi yet no I hate playing the RDA say to deal with the navi I can see that much

07:56:40.660 --> 07:56:46.900
very strongly but I don't understand how there's plants around here that the navi can claim

07:56:47.540 --> 07:56:49.220
because that it's not like I can you like it

07:56:54.100 --> 07:56:57.460
I'm just bombing everything actually I probably just bought myself you know that

07:56:58.420 --> 07:57:03.940
unless I can get out here fast enough whoa whoa whoa whoa we need to do that

07:57:05.940 --> 07:57:08.420
okay please tell me I did them all

07:57:08.740 --> 07:57:12.100

07:57:34.340 --> 07:57:38.100

07:57:44.820 --> 07:57:49.700
the pest you're taking the pest you're taking the fist

07:57:49.700 --> 07:57:56.500
you don't need to do that please stop embodying on me I'm trying to dodge the AIM but I don't have

07:57:56.500 --> 07:58:02.260
health unlock I can heal now I can even go next I can almost go Gon vice I can almost go

07:58:02.260 --> 07:58:11.860
go in viz hold on where's the last thing that I need to go if I take if I just go

07:58:11.860 --> 07:58:16.980
back to where I came from that sounds I mean if I go back to my hotel for how

07:58:16.980 --> 07:58:23.980
did I get there though I go forward and take a right

07:58:24.220 --> 07:58:30.540
surely I'm a bit I'm a bit disoriented on this map if I take a right on this

07:58:30.540 --> 07:58:39.820
log if I get on that log then I should be able to do you mind honestly give me a

07:58:39.820 --> 07:58:44.020
jump scare whenever he is like hanging about honestly I can't believe it I

07:58:44.020 --> 07:58:49.860
can't believe that you're hanging about on your planet they really wanted you to

07:58:49.860 --> 07:58:54.180
know that the RDA or the bad guys literally so punishing to play the RDA

07:58:54.180 --> 07:58:58.780
side sorry but it like Navi so easy I was an overcritical but I don't think the

07:58:58.780 --> 07:59:04.580
game is balanced well it just it just seems like unless I'm missing like the

07:59:04.580 --> 07:59:10.020
gun that you're supposed to use in quotation marks I am getting brutally

07:59:10.020 --> 07:59:16.820
oh no I don't use the teleport I do 180 and I go this way just to make triple

07:59:16.820 --> 07:59:22.220
sure yeah I do not want to take off in the wrong direction it's punishing but

07:59:22.220 --> 07:59:28.580
fun if it's fun for you to watch me get punished then sure punish me away but

07:59:28.620 --> 07:59:41.780
this is region just think I'm just doing so bad I can hear again they gave you a

07:59:41.780 --> 07:59:52.340
guard down for stealth no run kills off I hope this is the area I'm gonna cry if

07:59:52.380 --> 08:00:00.060
this is like a dead end up here both to play and watch you honestly I never

08:00:00.060 --> 08:00:03.580
understood like streamers that can like punish themselves over and over the same

08:00:03.580 --> 08:00:11.220
game like I just don't well that's what I don't want none of that I swear if

08:00:11.220 --> 08:00:21.860
there's a dog behind me stop it okay that's him there I'm really not

08:00:21.900 --> 08:00:27.460
interested in going down to get wrecked by all the other NPCs as well but I don't

08:00:27.460 --> 08:00:36.940
think I almost just forfeit all that progress right there that's my shotgun

08:00:36.940 --> 08:00:52.940
and you put that way so I can do rounds who are you oh come on come on do it do it do it do it do it do it you

08:00:52.940 --> 08:00:56.020

zero for me baby oh no fall dammit hmm right I'm not gonna go in the vines

08:01:04.100 --> 08:01:09.980
next time he was honestly taking a hammer in I feel sorry for me can you play

08:01:09.980 --> 08:01:14.020
the RDA side okay I've respawned in the area which is good but bad because the

08:01:14.020 --> 08:01:19.160
NPCs are literally all okay okay we actually didn't lose the progress on the

08:01:19.160 --> 08:01:23.900
health bar I don't think I've seen that before but lol

08:01:23.900 --> 08:01:40.020
oh wow just spawn all the NPCs together I don't you know it's fine I didn't want

08:01:40.020 --> 08:01:58.740
anyone let me reload let me reload and I can deal you oh wow I'm actually out of

08:01:58.740 --> 08:02:05.860

08:02:05.900 --> 08:02:16.380

08:02:43.740 --> 08:02:51.140
it back to this person and then I think I'm done with the worst map ever this map

08:02:51.140 --> 08:03:03.100
belongs under my sweaty feet never to be allowed to breathe fresh dry air again

08:03:03.100 --> 08:03:11.580
that was awful and I wish not to ever be subjected to this because oh my gosh I

08:03:11.580 --> 08:03:14.300
know there's buggies everywhere but I don't even want to get in them because

08:03:14.300 --> 08:03:21.500
they just explode in a millisecond goes to the trash ah so it's a good map no it

08:03:21.500 --> 08:03:31.580
deserves nothing but my manky sweaty grippers perma sweat oh my god don't don't

08:03:31.580 --> 08:03:37.780

avatars are dead let me guess neither one of them was harper oh I've still not

08:03:47.860 --> 08:03:51.380
defeated harper okay I guess we've got another map after that it's deeper in

08:03:51.380 --> 08:03:58.460
the forest how to pin check with officer Midori she might have an update three rock

08:03:58.460 --> 08:04:03.700
shards so where do I grab this harmonic yeah good question it's thick out there

08:04:03.700 --> 08:04:09.020
and that radar serious service but I got something more I'm picking up a faint more

08:04:09.020 --> 08:04:13.060
it's not over just might be our willow tree wait say it again with the bidim's

08:04:13.060 --> 08:04:17.300

08:04:17.300 --> 08:04:20.980
say what did I say I've already forgotten

08:04:23.740 --> 08:04:31.220

08:04:31.220 --> 08:04:34.300

should be here all week bro we'll be here all week on this freaking one map on

08:05:10.180 --> 08:05:14.420
this one map they really did not want anyone to have fun on the RDA so it's

08:05:14.420 --> 08:05:24.820
like literally I want to say this is the harper fight and then I think that's it

08:05:24.820 --> 08:05:36.180
no no I'm not even scared anymore I am annoyed if I take a right then either

08:05:36.180 --> 08:05:41.820
way I'm gonna make it to the location some people enjoy suffering myself

08:05:41.820 --> 08:05:46.660
included but do you enjoy watching suffering like I actually don't mind

08:05:46.660 --> 08:05:50.780
watching like a binding of Isaac runs and if the person like struggles to get

08:05:50.780 --> 08:05:54.860
through it but still wins like I don't mind watching like I find it quite

08:05:54.860 --> 08:06:01.300
entertaining all right if I take the vines across yeah yeah okay oh and there

08:06:01.300 --> 08:06:07.180
you are thank you yeah yeah yeah please don't do that oh wait no they're gonna

08:06:07.180 --> 08:06:10.900

08:06:26.080 --> 08:06:28.820
something they are

08:06:29.820 --> 08:06:37.620
what I need well I'm a bit scared to go on this and all honestly I found it the

08:06:37.620 --> 08:06:46.860
willow tree oh right a boss fight with harper but I got no way down it's in a

08:06:46.860 --> 08:06:50.220
deep cavern I got to find another way in

08:06:51.020 --> 08:07:01.540
a lot of good that didn't it looks like a corp graveyard around here got it what

08:07:01.540 --> 08:07:05.140

08:07:17.980 --> 08:07:27.100
series and part one comes out this I almost just did what you think I almost

08:07:27.100 --> 08:07:32.700
just did I almost fell off the map doing that man over there that was very

08:07:32.700 --> 08:07:40.340
scary yeah rather than you should change yourself to suffering oh that just

08:07:40.340 --> 08:07:44.860
cancelled my invisibility okay that's fine no I totally didn't need that it's

08:07:44.860 --> 08:08:00.020

08:08:19.940 --> 08:08:24.380
too bad like honestly I'm actually enjoying to see what RDA say this but

08:08:24.380 --> 08:08:38.260
this map size is mercenary oh you ever alright right girl moment wait oh right

08:08:38.260 --> 08:08:50.420
no so this is max max protection well I'll take max protection and now we need

08:08:50.420 --> 08:08:59.620
to go this way what's that I'm to take one of these

08:09:02.740 --> 08:09:11.540

08:09:29.100 --> 08:09:37.900
Skyrim why is the music even scarier oh please be a small map oh it's a small

08:09:37.900 --> 08:09:49.740
map like y'all do thank you if it's small what just got me who are they

08:09:49.740 --> 08:09:59.740
above me it must be the Navi above me okay the Navi are oh there he is

08:10:00.700 --> 08:10:15.860
mm-hmm I have a problem and that problem is everyone has heists advantage over me

08:10:16.020 --> 08:10:28.120
yeah this unless they come down and bite me I am in so much trouble oh dear I'm

08:10:28.160 --> 08:10:33.400
gonna get snagged out of it I don't have infinite ammo I can't be messing around

08:10:33.400 --> 08:10:44.480
like that I don't have it now is there really no way for me to go unless it's

08:10:44.480 --> 08:10:54.080
over here I get out no it's wow this is like really rare to see in a video game

08:10:54.080 --> 08:10:59.240
unless I'm just I don't play many video games I really do not recall levels

08:10:59.240 --> 08:11:05.600
where you can't even reach the person I don't know maybe I'm being silly yeah

08:11:05.600 --> 08:11:13.560
see this is right you can go right one down I don't know how much health he has

08:11:13.560 --> 08:11:22.000
but bro I can't I cannot be spraying him with pistols like oh wait I have infinite

08:11:22.000 --> 08:11:34.680
ammo here silly me silly Billy hold on I saw that shooting I just spray him the

08:11:34.680 --> 08:11:40.600
entire time then I mean I'll do it don't think I won't you don't have to tell me

08:11:40.600 --> 08:11:45.920
twice if it's a spring free mission sure he just runs around in circles over and

08:11:46.680 --> 08:11:52.280
sadly I can't seem to reach the other NPCs oh they're attacking me actually

08:11:52.280 --> 08:12:04.480
getting they jump in yeah whoa the AI is so brutal as a mavi sorry hold on I'm

08:12:04.480 --> 08:12:09.440
starting to I don't know if I should actually just focus on the main guy you

08:12:10.160 --> 08:12:16.520
said the I don't know if they're infinitely respawning or not that's the

08:12:16.520 --> 08:12:21.760
reason why I want to clear them out but I'm getting the feeling they're

08:12:21.760 --> 08:12:34.400
infinitely responding maybe oh I just destroyed that plant where is it wow I'm

08:12:34.400 --> 08:12:39.420
like actually struggling wow okay half hell I think just more I think just more

08:12:39.420 --> 08:12:54.420
down it's the best I got I'm just gonna tank it I'm I really am I'm just gonna

08:12:54.420 --> 08:13:08.260
tank it yeah this definitely is given like battle dome unending and thanks

08:13:08.300 --> 08:13:12.820
for waiting around until I stand up again actually do appreciate that AI oh that's

08:13:12.820 --> 08:13:23.380
not good that's really not good oh this is what I was worried about but there's

08:13:23.380 --> 08:13:33.220
definitely more spawning and I'm not way sure what the answer is other than

08:13:33.220 --> 08:13:40.100
spray him that's really the best I can do just hope that we mavi cross hairs

08:13:40.100 --> 08:13:44.340
going on he is getting staggered he is getting staggered there's there's no

08:13:44.340 --> 08:13:52.940
denying that but the Navier again our control up here I don't have high the

08:13:52.940 --> 08:13:59.980
plants keep respawning I don't know if maybe the plants the battle rifle can

08:13:59.980 --> 08:14:11.940
help you in this moment oh my god shotgun and shotgun ah well let me

08:14:11.940 --> 08:14:17.900
thought since way doesn't feel like nothing's happening right now what gun the

08:14:17.900 --> 08:14:24.180
battle rifle battle rifle or any launcher Neil Gunn is it actually called

08:14:24.180 --> 08:14:33.820

hold on he looks oh hold on hold on hold on I'm just flopping on my face hold

08:14:43.660 --> 08:14:59.620
on leave it oh okay okay it's like a triple bar okay it's triple bar we're

08:14:59.620 --> 08:15:03.380
trying we're trying that's the main thing like we can do it we can 100% do

08:15:03.380 --> 08:15:08.660
that I believe I believe it's just gonna take a sweet time like especially if the

08:15:08.660 --> 08:15:14.980
game just constantly is resupplying with new Navi for this guy it makes me

08:15:14.980 --> 08:15:21.740
think this is the last boss fight in the last match though because this is big

08:15:21.740 --> 08:15:30.180
like this is big this is protection prayer on I can hardly see his body to

08:15:30.940 --> 08:15:48.380
okay yeah okay okay okay frickin did it we don't do okay oh oh he's mad I foiled

08:15:48.380 --> 08:15:56.220
his plans he said resin for us and okay let's okay okay hold on let me let me

08:15:56.220 --> 08:16:07.340
get off let me go let me go let me go let me go hello hello I can't even heal

08:16:14.140 --> 08:16:18.780
you for swapping to pistols the most useless out of everything no it is very

08:16:18.780 --> 08:16:25.420
much needed right now very much needed the most useless no I need to go I'm

08:16:25.420 --> 08:16:32.700
in viz yeah man viz literally I'm gonna heal on rock I'm gonna heal on rock yeah

08:16:32.700 --> 08:16:38.580

08:17:15.940 --> 08:17:22.580
actually died you know that I've only got one like cell thing oh I'm glad I have

08:17:22.580 --> 08:17:34.220
protection up but I'm I'm I actually don't have faith you know that I'm losing

08:17:34.220 --> 08:17:39.820
faith I do not believe unless I can grab these quick enough I literally don't have

08:17:39.820 --> 08:17:47.020
a revive if I go down by the way yeah see this that this the amount of abilities

uncheese uncheese uncheese command and she's command and she's command and

08:41:10.600 --> 08:41:15.400
choose command right now uncheasing uncheasing commence uncheasing

08:41:15.400 --> 08:41:21.880
commence uncheasing commence uncheasing commence untruth you are all gonna need

08:41:21.880 --> 08:41:28.320
to like stop with this freaking blasting thing. This is an absolute nightmare. Like all of

08:41:28.320 --> 08:41:40.320
them are using... I can't. I can't. I hate to be the UwU girl that goes, I literally

08:41:40.320 --> 08:41:46.360
can't right now. I literally can't right now. I don't even know where the Thanator is.

08:41:46.440 --> 08:41:54.440
Is the Thanator stuck? At least she's the Thanator. Are you stuck? Oh thank the maker.

08:41:54.440 --> 08:42:07.440
Thank the maker, this is a buggy old 2009 game. Eat lead in puke because oh my gosh this game

08:42:07.440 --> 08:42:16.240
is so hard. I heard that, I heard you, I literally just heard you spawning. Oh yeah and just heal

08:42:16.240 --> 08:42:20.240
up. No it's fine, it's fine, just heal all your health. It's fine, it doesn't matter.

08:42:20.240 --> 08:42:31.240
It doesn't matter. No it doesn't matter at all. Get out of my face. No, no! All the time.

08:42:31.240 --> 08:42:43.240
Get out, I'm literally freaking walling on stuff. Go away. Stop healing, stop healing.

08:42:43.240 --> 08:42:54.240
Stop! I need to reload like this right now. Yeah, hold on, let me take a breather. I just

08:42:54.240 --> 08:43:09.240
needed one breather, like literally a second to formulate a thought. Ah! Ah the freaking...

08:43:09.240 --> 08:43:16.240
I'm trying so hard, I literally am trying so hard. This is just, and then just spawn

08:43:16.240 --> 08:43:27.240
more navi there, they're coming down the hill. I'm stuck against something. Oh please, please!

08:43:28.240 --> 08:43:42.240
Oh, um, uh, I cast protection. Oh, oh and um, oh, oh, don't do that, don't do that again,

08:43:42.240 --> 08:43:56.240
that's not funny. Talk meeeeere! I'm gonna fucking lose it if I actually die here. Go and just

08:43:56.240 --> 08:44:05.240
perish to the elements or something. This is insane. This is standing the field up. No.

08:44:05.240 --> 08:44:11.240
Get staggered beyond belief and they don't stagger when they use that ability. And their

08:44:11.240 --> 08:44:15.240
ability to freaking his own cooldown, there's no such thing as cooldown to them, they actually

08:44:15.240 --> 08:44:23.240
don't know what it is. But my cooldown lasts forever! Literally I can't even cast protection.

08:44:24.240 --> 08:44:34.240
Oh and I need to reload at the stupid freaking orange box! And I've got one. Yeah, yeah, yeah,

08:44:34.240 --> 08:44:45.240
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. No one's surprised. Freaking spraying. It's literally the more health...

08:44:45.240 --> 08:44:52.240
No, yeah, you just do it again. Again with the same move. Oh this is getting ridiculous,

08:44:52.240 --> 08:44:58.240
mate. Go and just get a rest, honestly. Oh and you'd repel back to health again because

08:44:58.240 --> 08:45:03.240
you can't even just 1v fucking 1v. Literally, I'm not being funny, but if these are like

08:45:03.240 --> 08:45:08.240
supposed to be avatars with like titanium bones and stuff and you literally can't 1v 1v without

08:45:08.240 --> 08:45:14.240
fucking prayer protection on every 2 seconds with that stupid move!

08:45:19.240 --> 08:45:33.240
Oh, fucking terrible, actually. Just perish! Honestly, stop using these abilities. Oh my god, man.

08:45:33.240 --> 08:45:43.240
Yay, we did it! Let's go! Oh, I'm so glad that's over. Right, let's move on to the next one.

08:45:43.240 --> 08:45:49.240
Yeah, and they're already shooting me. Already, already, already. Right, okay, we'll teleport.

08:45:49.240 --> 08:45:55.240
Gigi easy. Oh, I just... I keep forgetting that I'm not as tall as Navi so I can't just

08:45:55.240 --> 08:46:04.240
jump that. Oh, well, I didn't need to go on that so sure, whatever. We did it! That was awful.

08:46:04.240 --> 08:46:10.240
That was awful. You don't even pick the difficulty in this thing. My controller is literally dripping

08:46:10.240 --> 08:46:15.240
with sweat. I thought you loved having autism. It's such a nice little fun tree on the side,

08:46:15.240 --> 08:46:22.240
doesn't it? Not. Oh, and I get to do one more. The protection prayer made me think this was

08:46:22.240 --> 08:46:31.240
a runescape stream for a second. Yeah, literally. If I could cast it. Oh.

08:46:35.240 --> 08:46:40.240
Is there a donation? Did I miss a donation? I think it's working. I don't know. Someone said

08:46:40.240 --> 08:46:44.240
they couldn't but then I think a few more donations came through after that so I don't

08:46:44.240 --> 08:46:51.240
know if it's messing up on Firefox or things are just not happy. Don't worry about it if

08:46:51.240 --> 08:47:02.240
it's not working. Oh, sorry. I just... Oh, I just choked on that. What month to go?

08:47:02.240 --> 08:47:16.240
Plain? Take a scorpion and report to the last commander. Yeah, let's try it. Oh. You'll read

08:47:16.240 --> 08:47:23.240
it later. I just sent one a bit ago. I don't see it. You're not the only one to say that

08:47:23.240 --> 08:47:30.240
you've sent a thingy but it's not came through. I don't know why. The last one I see is from

08:47:30.240 --> 08:47:38.240
TinySpiny. It says I've returned from the dog. Wait, did it actually not go through? I don't

08:47:38.240 --> 08:47:42.240
want you to don't know if it's not showing up seriously though. Like if it's not showing

08:47:42.240 --> 08:47:50.240
up, don't know. I don't know what's going on. Where the heck? What am I supposed to go

08:47:50.240 --> 08:47:54.240
on my... Can I just fly through that? Oh, no. I have to fly through the gap. I can already

08:47:54.240 --> 08:48:06.240
tell. The last commander seems promising. I can hope so. The RDA site is... It's been

08:48:06.240 --> 08:48:17.240
an experience but I'm not sure it's been won for... Yeah, okay. Okay, okay. Let's just

08:48:17.240 --> 08:48:21.240
break through the rocks. Don't mind me. Don't worry. I'm always happy to escort my local

08:48:21.240 --> 08:48:29.240
calm fish. I know I wouldn't display them. Where am I going? Just a little to the right.

08:48:29.240 --> 08:48:35.240
Oh, my goodness. Okay, there's the helipad that I'm supposed to land on. Thank goodness. Make

08:48:35.240 --> 08:48:45.240
it nice and easy for me. A little cheeky crash land in there. Don't mind me. Is this not it?

08:48:45.240 --> 08:48:50.240
Looks like it. At least when it's over, you can see you've finally completed the game.

08:48:50.240 --> 08:48:57.240
Honestly, it's been fun but there's a reason my Tism didn't attach on this game too much

08:48:57.240 --> 08:49:04.240
because there's quite a few things like that that are really annoying. Hey, last one.

08:49:04.240 --> 08:49:07.240
Oh.

08:49:11.240 --> 08:49:16.240
The only reason I could even win that last fight is because I managed to cheat that Thanotaur.

08:49:16.240 --> 08:49:21.240
I cannot imagine if I would even get past that if that Thanotaur didn't get caught in the

08:49:21.240 --> 08:49:26.240
roll. I'm sorry. I said that wrong.

08:49:31.240 --> 08:49:34.240
Am I allowed to slide to get there?

08:49:34.240 --> 08:49:39.240
I'm going to be giving me a mix. I'll take a mix because he's giving me a mix.

08:49:39.240 --> 08:49:46.240
Then you can play the domination minigame. I like on the navi side. I've never played it on this side.

08:49:47.240 --> 08:49:55.240
Alrighty. If I take a right, then everything shall be alright.

08:49:55.240 --> 08:50:00.240
Let's hope this last one. Strony, you sound sleepy. I hope you're having fun.

08:50:00.240 --> 08:50:03.240
You know, I'm having fun. I know that sounds like a-

08:50:03.240 --> 08:50:09.240
That's a fat punch. I'm getting spawned spanked by a freaking plant.

08:50:10.240 --> 08:50:15.240
I'm enjoying it. It's just because I've never played it before.

08:50:15.240 --> 08:50:20.240
I just did not expect at all how unbelievably hard it was.

08:50:20.240 --> 08:50:27.240
For example, there's RDA soldiers literally getting messed up by these plants.

08:50:27.240 --> 08:50:33.240
They're just letting it happen. I had no idea they would make it so hard.

08:50:33.240 --> 08:50:36.240
On the navi side, you can just ignore everything.

08:50:36.240 --> 08:50:40.240
But when you're a wee human, you actually can't ignore everything.

08:50:40.240 --> 08:50:43.240
Or else you're like a big doo-doo.

08:50:54.240 --> 08:50:59.240
I'm hoping I do get a good night's sleep soon because it's really hard to be creative.

08:50:59.240 --> 08:51:05.240
RDAs and MarkoLabs are coming up with scripts when I've literally got no thoughts going on behind my skull.

08:51:10.240 --> 08:51:12.240
There's RDAs.

08:51:14.240 --> 08:51:18.240
I'm actually going to pick it up because they're too valuable.

08:51:18.240 --> 08:51:21.240
Wait, I can't even go up on my head.

08:51:23.240 --> 08:51:26.240
Okay, I need to climb on foot.

08:51:27.240 --> 08:51:30.240
RDAs say it's too real sad.

08:51:30.240 --> 08:51:32.240
I hope you're doing a good night's sleep.

08:51:32.240 --> 08:51:36.240
Yeah, I've not had a decent one in quite a while.

08:51:36.240 --> 08:51:39.240
Oh my god, there's so many of them.

08:51:39.240 --> 08:51:42.240
Okay, that was good. I like that.

08:51:42.240 --> 08:51:45.240
I think it tears that fast all the time. That's great.

08:51:47.240 --> 08:51:54.240
See, when it misses, it really bothers me.

08:51:57.240 --> 08:52:01.240
Oh, I'm just going in biz. I don't know. There's enemies everywhere.

08:52:05.240 --> 08:52:07.240
Oh, I can hear one right behind me.

08:52:07.240 --> 08:52:10.240
I'm going to try and claim this before default.

08:52:10.240 --> 08:52:12.240
Get some rest. I will get some good rest.

08:52:12.240 --> 08:52:15.240
I don't know what my stream is tomorrow. I can't remember.

08:52:15.240 --> 08:52:17.240
Is it ASMR?

08:52:20.240 --> 08:52:22.240
Or is that a small game?

08:52:23.240 --> 08:52:26.240
I think it goes ASMR sweets.

08:52:26.240 --> 08:52:28.240
Oh, this is a boss fight.

08:52:28.240 --> 08:52:30.240
Yeah, I'm already getting ruled.

08:52:30.240 --> 08:52:32.240
Oh, I'm already getting ruled by boss.

08:52:32.240 --> 08:52:34.240
Okay, this is what I can't stand.

08:52:34.240 --> 08:52:39.240
I'm about to go do a boss fight and there's like a billion rub.

08:52:39.240 --> 08:52:42.240
Nah, nah, come on, mate.

08:52:43.240 --> 08:52:45.240
Yeah, this is getting ridiculous.

08:52:46.240 --> 08:52:48.240
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

08:52:48.240 --> 08:52:51.240
Thank goodness I was picking up RDA things.

08:52:53.240 --> 08:52:54.240
Whoa.

08:52:57.240 --> 08:52:59.240
No, no, you're so dead.

08:52:59.240 --> 08:53:00.240
Get that.

08:53:01.240 --> 08:53:05.240
Right, a spell of protection, spell of invincibility,

08:53:05.240 --> 08:53:07.240
because what the actual?

08:53:09.240 --> 08:53:11.240
Bro, you're going to need to let...

08:53:12.240 --> 08:53:14.240
I'm dead on the last one.

08:53:15.240 --> 08:53:16.240
I need a breather.

08:53:17.240 --> 08:53:22.240
I literally need a health breather.

08:53:22.240 --> 08:53:25.240
The AI can freaking see me.

08:53:28.240 --> 08:53:31.240
Yeah, she literally won't go down

08:53:31.240 --> 08:53:34.240
because she keeps activating all of her abilities.

08:53:34.240 --> 08:53:36.240
This is ridiculous.

08:53:40.240 --> 08:53:42.240
Right, so they're...

08:53:43.240 --> 08:53:45.240
Okay.

08:53:47.240 --> 08:53:50.240
Bro, you're just stun-locking me.

08:53:52.240 --> 08:53:54.240
I literally can't get close enough.

08:53:57.240 --> 08:54:00.240
Yeah, how do you like being fucking stun-locked?

08:54:00.240 --> 08:54:02.240
Oh, fuck off!

08:54:03.240 --> 08:54:06.240
Just infinite spawn after spot.

08:54:06.240 --> 08:54:08.240
So get the fucking moab out, honestly.

08:54:09.240 --> 08:54:12.240
What the fucking is this shit, honestly?

08:54:17.240 --> 08:54:19.240
Have I activated it?

08:54:19.240 --> 08:54:20.240
Hello, stamina?

08:54:26.240 --> 08:54:27.240
Lovely.

08:54:28.240 --> 08:54:29.240
Let me analize.

08:54:29.240 --> 08:54:31.240
That did a sweet fuck all.

08:54:31.240 --> 08:54:32.240
Lovely, lovely.

08:54:32.240 --> 08:54:35.240
Don't ever show your fucking hideous face again.

08:54:35.240 --> 08:54:37.240
That was what bloody waste that was.

08:54:38.240 --> 08:54:40.240
Right, that's the best I got, Berserk.

08:54:41.240 --> 08:54:43.240
Berserk's literally the best I got.

08:54:44.240 --> 08:54:47.240
And I get stunned the moment I use it.

08:54:51.240 --> 08:54:54.240
Bro, I need to put a little invisible on

08:54:54.240 --> 08:54:56.240
so I can literally heal in time.

08:54:58.240 --> 08:55:01.240
I'm gonna get stunned the millisecond.

08:55:06.240 --> 08:55:09.240
This is why I don't play read games on stream

08:55:09.240 --> 08:55:12.240
because I literally can't even handle a normal game.

08:55:13.240 --> 08:55:15.240
And then invisible again so I can't get him

08:55:15.240 --> 08:55:17.240
and then tarot him shooting at me

08:55:17.240 --> 08:55:19.240
and then stun me, and stun me, and stun me,

08:55:19.240 --> 08:55:21.240
and stun me, and stun me, and stun me.

08:55:21.240 --> 08:55:23.240
Okay, we get it, we get it, we get it, we get it, we get it.

08:55:23.240 --> 08:55:25.240
We love a good stun, we all...

08:55:26.240 --> 08:55:28.240
And then, yeah, and then into the spawn rate.

08:55:28.240 --> 08:55:29.240
What are their abilities?

08:55:29.240 --> 08:55:31.240
You literally just use that one

08:55:31.240 --> 08:55:34.240
so you don't even have a cooldown at all.

08:55:34.240 --> 08:55:37.240
Oh, and then in comes your buddy use.

08:55:37.240 --> 08:55:39.240
Yeah, and then your buddy uses their ability.

08:55:39.240 --> 08:55:42.240
And then I'm away wasting ammo yet again.

08:55:42.240 --> 08:55:45.240
Oh, yeah, again, I'm not the frickin' boss.

08:55:47.240 --> 08:55:49.240
You're gonna need to get a great game.

08:55:49.240 --> 08:55:51.240
Honestly, you're gonna need, again, a straight to ability.

08:55:51.240 --> 08:55:53.240
Can't, need to wait, need to wait.

08:55:56.240 --> 08:55:58.240
Again, straight to ability.

08:55:58.240 --> 08:56:00.240
Fucking infinite, buddy.

08:56:00.240 --> 08:56:02.240
Yep, and then the gift.

08:56:02.240 --> 08:56:04.240
No, oh, a Christmas miracle.

08:56:04.240 --> 08:56:06.240
I actually got a fucking thing from it.

08:56:08.240 --> 08:56:09.240
Wow.

08:56:09.240 --> 08:56:11.240
Oh, and your pal's already back.

08:56:12.240 --> 08:56:14.240
I've not even been away for, like, on the list, I think.

08:56:15.240 --> 08:56:18.240
I'm gonna have to go into this and fucking do this, right?

08:56:18.240 --> 08:56:20.240
At least I've reloaded, but...

08:56:21.240 --> 08:56:23.240
Yeah, and I'm already in spanked.

08:56:23.240 --> 08:56:25.240
I don't even remember the fucking enemy that I'm supposed to be killing is.

08:56:25.240 --> 08:56:27.240
Oh, and straight to the ability.

08:56:27.240 --> 08:56:29.240
What a classic.

08:56:30.240 --> 08:56:32.240
Oh, more of your pal's!

08:56:35.240 --> 08:56:36.240
There's nothing I can do.

08:56:36.240 --> 08:56:39.240
There's actually nothing I can do other than tick damage.

08:56:39.240 --> 08:56:44.240
This is just the tiniest amount of damage that can be dealt at any moment.

08:56:44.240 --> 08:56:45.240
And it just...

08:56:45.240 --> 08:56:47.240
Over and over again!

08:56:49.240 --> 08:56:52.240
Literally playing this game over and over again.

08:56:52.240 --> 08:56:54.240
One hit, get nothing more.

08:56:54.240 --> 08:56:56.240
Have to heal, get nothing more.

08:56:56.240 --> 08:56:58.240
Just fucking perish off.

08:56:58.240 --> 08:57:00.240
Fucking map!

08:57:01.240 --> 08:57:03.240
Uh, I'm dead. I'm actually dead.

08:57:04.240 --> 08:57:07.240
I don't have a invis, and I don't have a heal.

08:57:10.240 --> 08:57:13.240
I don't know what you want me to do.

08:57:16.240 --> 08:57:18.240
Who made this? Ubisoft?

08:57:19.240 --> 08:57:20.240
How many game...

08:57:20.240 --> 08:57:22.240
How many fucking playtesters have you got?

08:57:22.240 --> 08:57:24.240
Like, one max, maybe?

08:57:24.240 --> 08:57:26.240
Do you share one for, like, one fucking region?

08:57:26.240 --> 08:57:27.240
One for whole of Oceanic?

08:57:27.240 --> 08:57:28.240
One for whole of Bloody Europe?

08:57:28.240 --> 08:57:30.240
One for whole of fucking America?

08:57:30.240 --> 08:57:31.240
Like, what's going on?

08:57:31.240 --> 08:57:32.240
None of you's playtested this.

08:57:32.240 --> 08:57:33.240
Not one person.

08:57:33.240 --> 08:57:35.240
Not one person!

08:57:35.240 --> 08:57:37.240
Listen!

08:57:38.240 --> 08:57:40.240
Oh, let me just analyze and see if this is...

08:57:40.240 --> 08:57:41.240
There seems fair.

08:57:41.240 --> 08:57:42.240
Hmm...

08:57:42.240 --> 08:57:45.240
Right, let's do infinite spawning.

08:57:45.240 --> 08:57:47.240
Let's make sure you get stun law, right?

08:57:47.240 --> 08:57:48.240
Okay, hmm...

08:57:48.240 --> 08:57:49.240
Alright, let's do it.

08:57:49.240 --> 08:57:50.240
Let's do it!

08:57:50.240 --> 08:57:52.240
Let's do a cheeky gangbang!

08:57:52.240 --> 08:57:54.240
Oh my God!

08:57:54.240 --> 08:57:56.240
Let's just do a cheeky gangbang and make sure that the enemies...

08:57:56.240 --> 08:57:58.240
Enemies are allowed to infinite heal.

08:57:58.240 --> 08:58:00.240
It's fine. Enemies can infinite heal.

08:58:00.240 --> 08:58:02.240
Enemies can infinite fucking use their abilities.

08:58:02.240 --> 08:58:03.240
All the fucking time!

08:58:03.240 --> 08:58:08.240
And as soon as you give them a Santa me are off of their HP bar

08:58:08.240 --> 08:58:14.600
Oh, let's just make sure they just give them everything all it wants infinite fucking mana. Oh

08:58:14.900 --> 08:58:16.900
My god

08:58:16.900 --> 08:58:18.900
Just let it be over with

08:58:19.140 --> 08:58:22.840
Just let it happen. Oh my god

08:58:25.760 --> 08:58:27.760
Like I literally need to go invisible

08:58:28.160 --> 08:58:33.520
Oh my god, just let it be over

08:58:34.840 --> 08:58:36.840
Just let it be over

08:58:37.440 --> 08:58:43.520
Again, yeah instant stun lock as soon as you shit. I don't even have that ability is Navi when I play Navi

08:58:43.520 --> 08:58:45.520
I don't even have this ability

08:58:46.480 --> 08:58:51.240
Just instant fucking lock over and over and and your pals are back

08:58:51.960 --> 08:58:53.960
I

08:58:54.720 --> 08:58:59.320
Would absolutely love to have a whole fucking trade behind me, but I've nobody got that extension have a

08:59:22.240 --> 08:59:24.240
I

08:59:32.280 --> 08:59:34.280
Best I can do

08:59:40.720 --> 08:59:45.480
100 got 100 shotgun shells was there enough may you go get more

08:59:46.200 --> 08:59:54.960
Because it was now of course it was down off. Oh, yeah, no, it's fine. No, it's fine. I didn't want one

09:00:00.040 --> 09:00:02.040
Yep, no, it's fine. I

09:00:04.600 --> 09:00:06.600
Love being absolutely incapacitated

09:00:09.280 --> 09:00:11.280
No, this is so fun

09:00:12.280 --> 09:00:13.800
I

09:00:13.800 --> 09:00:21.560
Love it. You should do it more Ashley. How about you just spawn eight NPCs all fucking one said one time. Oh my fucking god

09:00:23.200 --> 09:00:28.280
Fucking RDA fan is honestly. Oh, and I'm probably gonna die jumping off this clutch looking me

09:00:28.640 --> 09:00:33.460
Just to really fucking ace it on the cake. They just actually can he stop it. They actually

09:00:37.120 --> 09:00:39.120
Yeah

09:00:41.880 --> 09:00:48.040
Yep, and all aimed even though in viz all in will continue probably not even be able to heal and play man

09:00:48.040 --> 09:00:49.400
I get to die

09:00:49.400 --> 09:00:53.000
Because I only have one fucking RDA element to my fucking name

09:00:53.640 --> 09:00:55.640
But here

09:00:58.240 --> 09:00:59.920
Yeah

09:00:59.920 --> 09:01:04.880
This better be the last mission. I am like fucking correct right now. I

09:01:05.920 --> 09:01:08.640
Really hope like I severely hope this is the last mission

09:01:08.640 --> 09:01:10.640
I

09:01:11.000 --> 09:01:13.840
Instant damage to the mech not even in the body sign

09:01:15.920 --> 09:01:20.240
For the cheeky gang bang party parrot party parrot party parrot

09:01:22.040 --> 09:01:25.320
It's never fucking ending volt was it vault

09:01:27.000 --> 09:01:33.720
Vulcan thank you for the tip. It's never ending. There is no way that was

09:01:34.120 --> 09:01:37.880
appropriately play tested unless I'm missing like

09:01:38.640 --> 09:01:45.720
Some major notes and I missed a massive patch that came out for this game in 2009 that there's no

09:01:46.200 --> 09:01:47.200
way

09:01:47.200 --> 09:01:51.720
That is the gameplay and then the dev team happy with that game

09:01:53.720 --> 09:01:56.840
Refused to accept that that even got passed

09:01:59.560 --> 09:02:02.060
Absolutely refused to accept that got passed I

09:02:02.260 --> 09:02:11.340
Don't think anyone got this far in the police say I completely agree with that statement because what on earth was that

09:02:12.980 --> 09:02:17.380
Literally, I don't have an ability when I play Navi if I get hit I have a massive fucking throbbing

09:02:17.700 --> 09:02:23.020
Fucking pulse coming from a bloody groin. No, I don't want to teleport. I want to talk to the man

09:02:26.300 --> 09:02:28.300
Please let it be over

09:02:32.980 --> 09:02:35.260
Hmm let it be over

09:02:36.820 --> 09:02:38.820
Let it be over. Yeah, I'm not

09:02:42.820 --> 09:02:44.820
Let it be over

09:02:47.380 --> 09:02:51.420
Yeah, that Moab did absolutely nothing. I don't even know what the point of that was

09:02:53.020 --> 09:02:57.820
Let it be over let it be over let it be over let it be over let it be over let it be over

09:02:58.820 --> 09:03:01.620
Thanks for borrowing a condom

09:03:05.980 --> 09:03:09.860
This game was pretty bad pretty fast after lunch thanks to the game getting canned hard

09:03:10.620 --> 09:03:16.260
And took their money in around I mean they made them if they got two points seven million sales. Yeah

09:03:22.420 --> 09:03:24.420
Are we there

09:03:24.460 --> 09:03:30.620
You so much you put a scratch there there last at least the section saying you were you mean that wasn't the last section

09:03:30.620 --> 09:03:33.020
Are you implying there is more to this fucking thing?

09:03:33.620 --> 09:03:36.740
Horses or did you to board a dragon to fly to some location?

09:03:37.460 --> 09:03:40.780
This is why mommy likes me hold her hand. Yes. This is why I like

09:03:45.500 --> 09:03:50.140
You're still streaming. Oh, you just missed the part where I screamed down the make so yeah

09:03:51.020 --> 09:03:53.020
Oh

09:03:54.620 --> 09:03:59.380
Please let me go with this right why does the conductor keep putting me on?

09:03:59.820 --> 09:04:03.860
Why did they keep creating more and more sections of this fucking site of the map?

09:04:08.380 --> 09:04:13.580
Okay, this is it this is it the map looks like this is it there's nothing more of the matter

09:04:14.140 --> 09:04:16.140
We just got worth it fuck was gone broke. Oh

09:04:17.780 --> 09:04:23.220
Well, we all pretended that you finished the game and you can go risk. No, this is it

09:04:23.820 --> 09:04:29.300
Look at the map. There's no way this map is a fetch quest because look at the state of it. There's nothing on it. Oh

09:04:31.820 --> 09:04:33.820
Did I get to drive this at least

09:04:35.380 --> 09:04:37.380
It's over

09:04:37.820 --> 09:04:39.820
It's over

09:04:40.660 --> 09:04:43.700
Oh, how do I fly this? Oh fuck me, man. Oh

09:04:45.980 --> 09:04:48.660
No, oh no, I don't like that. Oh, no

09:04:51.580 --> 09:04:58.060
Right, okay. Oh, yeah. Oh, huh. Oh, yeah, I can fly I can fly

09:04:59.620 --> 09:05:03.380
Call me Peter Pan because you can fly you can fly you can fly

09:05:04.380 --> 09:05:09.580
Okay, take it easy easy on the corners easy

09:05:10.700 --> 09:05:17.900
Pandora is a little wild for the road bumps and by road bumps the full mass of asphalt

09:05:21.020 --> 09:05:23.020
You can shoot the rocks

09:05:27.100 --> 09:05:29.100
Oh

09:05:29.100 --> 09:05:31.100
Oh

09:05:31.980 --> 09:05:33.980
Wait, I'm gonna run out of missiles

09:05:42.100 --> 09:05:47.660
That was a very successful drive, I think I don't think I actually bumped into one thing

09:05:49.820 --> 09:05:51.820
Easy easy

09:05:53.700 --> 09:05:55.700
Oh

09:06:00.100 --> 09:06:04.740
Okay, there are wolves, but that's fine. Nothing I can't handle. Oh

09:06:06.420 --> 09:06:09.900
I can't do my little flip in the war. It will flip

09:06:12.300 --> 09:06:14.300
What kind of sadistic

09:06:15.020 --> 09:06:18.500
Made to say you should be able to run out of missiles honestly

09:06:18.500 --> 09:06:25.100
It does seem about like that flight thing that flying dragon is massive and you're telling me they can't hold more than like 20

09:06:25.100 --> 09:06:27.100
missiles. Oh

09:06:27.500 --> 09:06:32.820
Here we go. Here we go. Here we go. Here we go. Here we go. Why are you holding that piece of paper? Oh

09:06:46.500 --> 09:06:48.500
What's the plan

09:06:49.500 --> 09:06:51.500
I'm not going anywhere near me

09:06:52.500 --> 09:06:58.020
We could use your help get that wall down and dig in I'm gonna do I'm gonna put down TNT

09:06:59.540 --> 09:07:06.980
As long as there's no boss fight, I couldn't be less of a rats or what fetch quest you send me on name your boss fights

09:07:08.340 --> 09:07:11.380
What is this? What is this armor?

09:07:13.500 --> 09:07:17.260
Protection down but everything else up. I think I'd rather protection up

09:07:19.380 --> 09:07:21.380
Just leave it leave it

09:07:21.700 --> 09:07:23.700
What's this? Right? What's the deal?

09:07:25.100 --> 09:07:27.100
What much I do?

09:07:27.980 --> 09:07:32.220
As long as there's no boss fight on the other side, I couldn't give the last of a rat

09:07:34.100 --> 09:07:36.100
I couldn't give the last rat

09:07:40.980 --> 09:07:42.980
Anymore

09:07:43.980 --> 09:07:48.380
If the goal was to make the count and pain memorable they should be sure succeeded

09:07:48.500 --> 09:07:50.860
Oh, I'd say more like miserable because

09:07:51.820 --> 09:07:56.700
Again, like literally the Navi instantly do that as soon as you injure them. They do their thing

09:07:58.500 --> 09:08:00.500
Except that one I guess

09:08:01.940 --> 09:08:05.660
Let's just let's navigate we're appropriate

09:08:08.980 --> 09:08:10.980
I don't know if I should just speed run it

09:08:12.500 --> 09:08:14.980
Can the make even go on the bridge that's up ahead?

09:08:19.500 --> 09:08:21.500
Oh

09:08:22.580 --> 09:08:29.060
Like this game parish definitely, yeah, thanks for that really appreciate that. Um

09:08:31.340 --> 09:08:35.780
Why am I being shot? I'm being chased. I'm being chased

09:08:38.900 --> 09:08:40.900
Um

09:08:41.900 --> 09:08:47.700
Oh, yeah, definitely happy to replay that's true brotherhood not happy to replay

09:08:50.820 --> 09:08:54.940
The Navi side yay fun the RDA side. Oh my god

09:08:56.420 --> 09:09:01.660
I think I've almost got two revives, but I don't think I have a boss fight anymore

09:09:01.660 --> 09:09:03.660
I think this is literally just

09:09:03.660 --> 09:09:05.660
Spring pray from here on out

09:09:10.900 --> 09:09:12.900
Oh

09:09:26.620 --> 09:09:31.420
That's a lot of Navi and they're probably gonna destroy my make-up. I'm not careful

09:09:33.220 --> 09:09:35.420
Where's BT when you need them honestly?

09:09:41.900 --> 09:09:43.900
I

09:09:44.340 --> 09:09:51.700
Might get out for that RDA dangerous, but I'm like it seems to be I just want a few revives on hand

09:09:51.700 --> 09:09:53.700
Oh, right. I've got two revives now

09:09:54.780 --> 09:09:58.420
As long as I can choose a hate thing if there's a fight ahead. I

09:09:58.900 --> 09:10:00.900
Just hope this oh my god, my mix

09:10:01.820 --> 09:10:03.820
Well, look at me. Let's just go for it

09:10:03.940 --> 09:10:05.940
I

09:10:08.780 --> 09:10:10.780
Right just go keep going

09:10:11.260 --> 09:10:13.260
Just like there's fates all the way up ahead

09:10:14.020 --> 09:10:16.020
We need BT

09:10:17.700 --> 09:10:22.380
Honestly sorry for reason the idea of RDA, but thank you for experience in it

09:10:23.260 --> 09:10:28.660
Thank you for experiencing the pain. I mean some people enjoy when streamers rage. I don't know

09:10:29.540 --> 09:10:31.340
I

09:10:31.340 --> 09:10:36.540
Got taken out in viz for that like some people genuinely love when streamers rage and I'm like

09:10:38.180 --> 09:10:44.180
Hold off the Navi. No, you are not gonna make them literally

09:10:50.180 --> 09:10:55.300
I don't know how freaking strong you think I am I am not that good. I that's

09:10:56.260 --> 09:11:04.460
Okay, I'm gonna try and keep a lid on it and not get overwhelmed very quickly. I am so glad I picked up the other RDA

09:11:08.780 --> 09:11:10.780
I can't do anything

09:11:18.180 --> 09:11:20.180
Yeah, I'm gonna need you guys

09:11:21.180 --> 09:11:23.180
I

09:11:24.860 --> 09:11:29.500
Need everyone to start spamming needs everywhere because I'm pretty sure those are RDA needs

09:11:29.500 --> 09:11:33.140
I'm gonna need everyone to do that unanimously unanimously right now

09:11:35.180 --> 09:11:38.020
It's not it's okay, just sacrifice me in the fire

09:11:40.660 --> 09:11:46.100
Oh, and I'm taking out in viz, which is the only time it helps to redo my

09:11:50.900 --> 09:11:57.300
Okay, I feel and then the damage protection to tell I can get my heal back up

09:11:59.620 --> 09:12:01.620
I need long range

09:12:05.660 --> 09:12:12.420
Our bombs, okay, those are definitely our needs. I feel like if the Navi were doing needs like that, I'd be a goner already

09:12:13.740 --> 09:12:16.380
Okay, okay, we're not overrun

09:12:20.500 --> 09:12:27.100
But don't want to jinx it, but I'm gonna grab that it's really important

09:12:29.180 --> 09:12:33.980
I'm really jinxed it but it's looking good only a minute 30 of this and then we're done

09:12:39.620 --> 09:12:41.620
Okay

09:12:42.860 --> 09:12:45.140
Protection on I don't really want to make me too much

09:12:50.900 --> 09:12:52.900
I'll take

09:12:57.060 --> 09:13:00.580
Okay, I don't know every spamming needs to keep doing that shit. Oh my god

09:13:01.220 --> 09:13:05.860
It's literally sunlocking them from hitting us. Oh, that's a lot. That's a lot. Hold on. Oh

09:13:09.300 --> 09:13:17.220
Dear I think I think maybe some of our soldiers went down because we're getting no, okay now we're overrun again

09:13:20.180 --> 09:13:25.140
If I can just whittle down some base health on them, it just makes all the world is different

09:13:33.700 --> 09:13:37.540
Oh, we might actually have three roses. Oh, I'm getting sunlocked my pardon

09:13:39.860 --> 09:13:45.460
I'm not that mad because I'm actually getting help like genuinely getting help and like they're not all all

09:13:45.780 --> 09:13:49.700
On to me it's when they all all often there's like nothing I can do hold on sorry

09:13:50.500 --> 09:13:52.420
Because I'm too busy

09:13:52.420 --> 09:13:54.420
freezing the game for not being absolutely

09:13:55.540 --> 09:13:57.540
I take it back

09:14:04.100 --> 09:14:08.940
Why do you fill out your pistols every time why do you insist on filling out the pistols?

09:14:09.820 --> 09:14:12.180
Well, I hope it didn't die because of that freaking cutscene

09:14:12.980 --> 09:14:14.500
Oh

09:14:14.500 --> 09:14:20.580
Is mercy up by the way, I think mercy may be alive. I may have completely missed it during my reach

09:14:22.820 --> 09:14:24.820
Oh

09:14:42.500 --> 09:14:44.500
Oh

09:14:50.420 --> 09:14:57.060
Okay, no, so they are still attacking whatever but I mean I'm getting left them own devices. I'll take it

09:15:01.940 --> 09:15:08.980
Danger danger danger high voltage. Okay. Mercy is live. Yes. Uh, monster. Welcome to link her. We will redirect into her

09:15:08.980 --> 09:15:13.300
I think we're almost done. I am going for a nap after this stream. I can tell you that much

09:15:16.260 --> 09:15:18.020
Wow

09:15:18.020 --> 09:15:23.060
Mercy's region. Yeah, if you want it, I don't know you'll need to see who reaches more me or mercy

09:15:26.100 --> 09:15:28.100
Oh, I'm done

09:15:28.900 --> 09:15:30.900
I can sense it

09:15:31.220 --> 09:15:33.700
I'm licking the screen right now

09:15:34.660 --> 09:15:36.660
Almost done

09:15:37.060 --> 09:15:40.420
You know, that's what I'm talking about now. We can take it to the room

09:15:42.260 --> 09:15:44.260
You need more than enough

09:15:46.260 --> 09:15:50.660
One reach stream to the next return to your dragon and fly to the well of souls. We've done it

09:15:52.420 --> 09:15:58.580
The evil has been defeated. I will never I'm very happy to say I will never play the rda side again

09:15:59.620 --> 09:16:02.420
Oh, uh a rank rotten experience

09:16:03.380 --> 09:16:08.180
Dev team do not speak ever again and do not cook ever again

09:16:10.260 --> 09:16:13.540
Thank you and good night. That's my review

09:16:18.500 --> 09:16:21.220
Forward a little to the right

09:16:24.980 --> 09:16:32.340
The gamer region real I was just it was just rinse and repeat rinse and repeat in the moment. I've got even uh

09:16:32.740 --> 09:16:39.620
A hint of damage a lick of damage to speed things up. Uh, either new guys were brought in

09:16:48.900 --> 09:16:50.740
Oh, it is I actually have a health bar just

09:16:51.860 --> 09:16:55.940
Definitely shouldn't be taking these corners too willy-nilly then

09:16:56.740 --> 09:17:04.420
I'm gonna start showing you but I can't help but find out whole when you're angry. Oh my god. I feel like that would be terrifying

09:17:09.540 --> 09:17:13.780
I'm making that PP shrivel up and go back and save me. I'm just gonna be terrified

09:17:14.820 --> 09:17:16.820
If I was on the receiving end of that

09:17:20.020 --> 09:17:22.420
Same here it's kind of what no

09:17:23.380 --> 09:17:26.020
Oh, my god. Sorry. Sorry women moments

09:17:27.220 --> 09:17:29.220
Looks partners bad boy

09:17:33.060 --> 09:17:37.780
Right we did it we have confirmed the evil

09:17:39.620 --> 09:17:43.460
Is the game gonna let us get there without being attacked by a plan

09:17:44.100 --> 09:17:46.100
Oh

09:17:47.700 --> 09:17:54.100
No fighting here or I'm gonna cry. I'm gonna angry spot is more. I'm sorry so but terrifies mommy

09:17:58.260 --> 09:18:00.260
Right oh

09:18:03.780 --> 09:18:05.780
Oh

09:18:05.780 --> 09:18:07.780
Oh

09:18:12.020 --> 09:18:14.020
I'm going

09:18:14.420 --> 09:18:16.020
Listen to you

09:18:16.020 --> 09:18:20.340
The new recruit fresh from earth. I've been working on this for over 10 years

09:18:20.500 --> 09:18:23.620
This is my moment right now. So if it doesn't work

09:18:24.260 --> 09:18:28.180
I'll see you on the other side. Oh wait. I have to I need to end him anyway

09:18:31.300 --> 09:18:33.300
Oh

09:18:34.260 --> 09:18:38.340
Well, this is gonna be beautifully satisfying

09:18:41.620 --> 09:18:44.980
Just let me cook a bit. Okay. It's fine. He has a belly. He's allowed him

09:18:44.980 --> 09:18:51.860
But yeah, it's just gonna be satisfying all things considered. Actually, you know what I could probably put on that double aggression thing

09:18:53.540 --> 09:18:56.100
Preserver. Yeah, let's do that

09:18:58.820 --> 09:19:00.820
Okay, that's fine

09:19:01.780 --> 09:19:03.780
Oh, he healed up

09:19:05.700 --> 09:19:09.380
I'm not sure I can send it to you healing up. So don't do that again

09:19:13.780 --> 09:19:16.420
Okay, I kind of like some walking and more I'm not gonna lie

09:19:18.980 --> 09:19:23.460
That's okay. He doesn't really seem to do anything. It seems like he blows

09:19:30.820 --> 09:19:32.820
Hmm

09:19:40.260 --> 09:19:43.700
I'm just giving him it. I'm just throwing everything out. I'm hold on a minute

09:19:46.820 --> 09:19:51.860
Oh, wow, so the sonic pulse is too far away none. Okay, he's full healed again

09:19:54.900 --> 09:19:59.460
Now sadly I am going to run out of ammo doing this method

09:20:00.420 --> 09:20:04.500
So not really sure what's supposed to happen

09:20:07.860 --> 09:20:12.420
It's fine you're allowed to do that, but maybe don't heal again

09:20:15.540 --> 09:20:17.540
Um

09:20:20.020 --> 09:20:24.180
Um, am I supposed to do something special for this fight?

09:20:30.420 --> 09:20:35.780
I don't know how many heals you get. If you get like five and then the game's like, okay, no more heals for you

09:20:36.020 --> 09:20:38.020
Well, why did the aim do it?

09:20:43.540 --> 09:20:53.300
Uh, is there like a ammo station? There was one back there. Uh, I'm literally out other than my shorty

09:20:59.460 --> 09:21:01.460
Oh

09:21:13.460 --> 09:21:18.500
I'm not like mad at this fight or anything, but like bro you keep healing like there's nothing I can do

09:21:20.980 --> 09:21:22.980
I don't like

09:21:30.420 --> 09:21:32.420
You use my mortar strike on him

09:21:48.340 --> 09:21:50.340
I did nothing to him

09:21:52.020 --> 09:21:54.020
Hello

09:21:55.780 --> 09:21:57.780
Um

09:21:59.700 --> 09:22:04.740
I'm a bit confused. Sorry. I need to change out my weapons because they're all empty. So I can't

09:22:05.460 --> 09:22:07.460
the nail gun sure

09:22:08.180 --> 09:22:11.620
Uh, it's already full me and there's no point in making it at flame doors or

09:22:14.020 --> 09:22:19.380
Uh, machine gun? I don't know. Okay. Oh, this one's different

09:22:24.100 --> 09:22:26.100
Okay, nail gun again

09:22:27.060 --> 09:22:29.060
All right, healed again

09:22:31.460 --> 09:22:34.900
I don't know if I'm supposed to call upon Awa to do something

09:22:37.700 --> 09:22:41.540
The utility looks like it's less literally sneaking on. I guess he's just a damage on

09:22:42.660 --> 09:22:44.660
Wait, just go to the glowing thing

09:22:45.380 --> 09:22:47.380
The thing back here

09:22:47.780 --> 09:22:49.780
No, it's a bit of a glowing thing

09:22:50.020 --> 09:22:52.020
I'm

09:22:52.340 --> 09:22:54.020
Blowing

09:22:54.020 --> 09:22:56.020
Sorry, I'm brain

09:22:56.500 --> 09:22:58.980
I'm both brain dead. I'm bling bling thing

09:23:00.100 --> 09:23:01.940
I'm looking

09:23:01.940 --> 09:23:06.340
But yeah, I'm starting to think I'm needing to like call upon Awa to like end him because

09:23:07.140 --> 09:23:12.820
I'm literally like swimming right now. Excuse me. I tried to go for a wee swim before I ended you

09:23:14.740 --> 09:23:16.740
I'm just gonna like up on Awa. Oops. Sorry

09:23:16.820 --> 09:23:18.820
Oh

09:23:19.060 --> 09:23:21.060
Blowing

09:23:23.460 --> 09:23:26.660
I'm definitely not to claim Awa right now glowing

09:23:31.780 --> 09:23:35.380
I thought that stick. I mean that stick is glowing. What the fuck it is

09:23:36.100 --> 09:23:38.100
I

09:23:42.260 --> 09:23:47.220
Warning de synchronization imminent honestly, can you bring him to a ledge?

09:23:51.220 --> 09:23:53.380
I feel like I'm supposed to do something here

09:23:59.300 --> 09:24:02.500
I think it's broke. Okay, so I watched a quick video and the guy

09:24:03.460 --> 09:24:07.460
He uses a green angel. Oh greening greening launcher. Okay

09:24:10.660 --> 09:24:15.140
Is this a grenade launcher? I only have 20 on the grenade

09:24:18.500 --> 09:24:20.500
Oh

09:24:21.620 --> 09:24:27.780
Oh, wow, really? Okay after all of that bro

09:24:27.860 --> 09:24:34.980
I'm starting to think this shit wasn't playtested at all past this point

09:24:54.180 --> 09:24:56.180
Are we the baddies

09:24:57.780 --> 09:24:59.780
All right

09:25:06.100 --> 09:25:08.980
Um, yeah, let's see where the baddies all right

09:25:12.900 --> 09:25:14.900
Ryder you there colonel quarch

09:25:15.380 --> 09:25:20.020
Analyst is going like a baseball stadium. What the hell did you do? I'm not sure

09:25:20.260 --> 09:25:26.580
Whatever you did it worked, but now we are making a quick retreat. I'm getting reports. They lost control of their band cheese

09:25:26.820 --> 09:25:28.820
That makes sense to you. Yeah

09:25:28.900 --> 09:25:30.260
It actually does

09:25:30.260 --> 09:25:32.660
Congrats Ryder. You're gonna be a hero for this

09:25:33.300 --> 09:25:37.860
I'll get your butt down here and that dragon better be spotless. He had damage on the dragon

09:25:38.900 --> 09:25:44.980
Eat that you grace. I heard we lost Kendra, but you need to know you did the right thing

09:25:45.700 --> 09:25:47.700
I hope it was all right

09:25:48.020 --> 09:25:51.140
This better bring peace. You've stopped a catastrophe, but this isn't over

09:25:51.700 --> 09:25:56.500
We can't keep control available for long nor should we and we've got more shit

09:25:56.580 --> 09:25:58.580
of humans do to arrive

09:25:58.980 --> 09:26:01.300
More is inevitable. So what was this all for?

09:26:01.860 --> 09:26:06.500
A we needed to see what we're not there being part two spoilers from the movie in the video game

09:26:06.900 --> 09:26:08.900
Next time she'll be ready

09:26:10.980 --> 09:26:12.980
Am I here

09:26:16.580 --> 09:26:19.940
Development team should be ashamed of yourself for the rda side

09:26:20.580 --> 09:26:26.020
Development team should be proud of yourselves from the navi side. Don't ever make me do that again. That's awful

09:26:27.060 --> 09:26:29.060
Oh my god

09:26:30.980 --> 09:26:34.260
I have no idea how hard I reach because I can't remember in the moment

09:26:35.300 --> 09:26:37.300
But oh my god

09:26:38.820 --> 09:26:41.460
Am I going mental or was that terrible?

09:26:43.620 --> 09:26:48.820
I think I must have I think I should have been using the grenade launcher clearly from that last fight

09:26:49.380 --> 09:26:52.100
and and because I didn't use the grenade launcher

09:26:53.220 --> 09:26:54.900
and

09:26:54.980 --> 09:26:57.780
It just got from like bad to worse or

09:26:58.500 --> 09:27:03.220
You blacked out when you raised. I don't remember really what I just remember like I did get angry

09:27:03.780 --> 09:27:07.380
But I don't remember anything that actually happened like one minute

09:27:07.380 --> 09:27:12.980
I was like getting annoyed and then the next minute the fight was over and I got stuck on a rock and I was trying to get down

09:27:16.020 --> 09:27:20.260
A grenade launcher is op. Okay, I guess that's probably you're shouting quite a bit

09:27:21.060 --> 09:27:23.060
I'm cheeky. Bye

09:27:23.380 --> 09:27:30.020
She literally saw red. Honestly. It was beautiful. Monka is you're rage is hot, but the mission was bad

09:27:31.700 --> 09:27:37.700
Angry girl, you were fuming at the man. I was frothing for mama. I clipped it. So show up one stream and it's Monka

09:27:37.780 --> 09:27:42.260
I don't even know. Am I going to be embarrassed if I look back on it like I don't feel that bad right now

09:27:42.420 --> 09:27:44.420
So kind of been that bad

09:27:45.380 --> 09:27:51.060
The game got dunked on hard and forgotten pretty quickly, but for the general community for a lot of good reasons

09:27:53.460 --> 09:27:58.020
At least you finished it. You deserve a good rest. Good girl. I'm proud of you for not driving up

09:27:58.420 --> 09:28:05.060
The rage has talked to your content. Well, that is literally why I do not play rage games like mercies unironically so brave

09:28:05.780 --> 09:28:09.380
For playing that game. Like I couldn't I'd just be scurrying and

09:28:10.340 --> 09:28:16.020
It may be a bit embarrassing, but at least it seems to have been for a good reason. I felt that rage. It's so funny

09:28:16.740 --> 09:28:20.820
Also, you might want to make more tea before sleeping or after waking up or for my voice

09:28:22.020 --> 09:28:26.820
I mean, it felt like a justifiable rage or he just won't make us cause the rage was justified. Okay

09:28:27.380 --> 09:28:29.380
Congrats. You did good job thing

09:28:30.100 --> 09:28:35.220
So you need more than an app. You may need to fill it. Oh, I hope I can get like a full eight hours. I've been needing it for a while

09:28:36.180 --> 09:28:40.420
Hmm, you didn't give up. So you did a good job at least. Heck yeah

09:28:41.860 --> 09:28:48.420
Mad cause bad. Lamar true. Literally all I had to do was pull out the grinny launcher

09:28:49.460 --> 09:28:51.460
apparently

09:28:51.860 --> 09:28:53.620
Lucky me

09:28:53.620 --> 09:28:55.620
Lucky me. All I had to do was pull it

09:28:56.900 --> 09:28:58.900
Take these head pads

09:28:59.460 --> 09:29:01.460
I would have went insane. You're amazing

09:29:02.180 --> 09:29:07.700
Well, then I feel like you guys probably would have figured out to swap to the weapon way before I did so

09:29:08.580 --> 09:29:12.260
Sending hugs if they're welcome. Otherwise you did so good. I'll take those hugs

09:29:13.220 --> 09:29:16.020
Are you the first person to finish this campaign on stream?

09:29:16.500 --> 09:29:20.660
Stop imagine if I was like the first vtuber to play this game. That would be hilarious

09:29:21.460 --> 09:29:27.940
And and the pov is like isn't the navi side amazing and then the rd side is me just screaming

09:29:27.940 --> 09:29:33.220
Sorry for forcing you to play that. I feel bad now. Nah, come on. I can stop at any time

09:29:34.980 --> 09:29:37.700
I just say stilettos and then I would stop. Don't worry

09:29:38.660 --> 09:29:44.100
If you're the first that counts as a world record, I would have thrown my monitor before changing weapons

09:29:44.740 --> 09:29:46.740
making vtuber history

09:29:47.300 --> 09:29:52.260
So when an angry scot rages. Oh, so wins the angry scotch rages somewhere on

09:29:52.260 --> 09:29:54.260
the floor

09:29:54.580 --> 09:30:01.940
I'm pretty sure you are though. Oh, no, I'm what sorry. I've already I've already forgotten what I'm probably would have overgranted

09:30:03.460 --> 09:30:08.580
Before and killed it with a bigger number. You're probably the only one that ever will you can be the avatar of youtuber

09:30:10.020 --> 09:30:12.500
The way of the water the way of the scot

09:30:14.100 --> 09:30:19.940
You did great powering through that heck. Yeah, think about it. You used the worst weapon to beat the game. Honestly

09:30:20.820 --> 09:30:24.580
I actually think you are the first vtuber to do answer every shipper history

09:30:24.660 --> 09:30:27.620
Not even a weekend after debut and i'm already making history

09:30:28.180 --> 09:30:30.900
But see fully the rda was a lot more fun than the navi

09:30:31.140 --> 09:30:36.980
Why because of the rage apparently everyone's got you know, half masked at the moment because they liked my rage

09:30:38.500 --> 09:30:41.780
The way of the scot the cut fish the way school and

09:30:42.900 --> 09:30:47.060
You have a full monopoly on this game now. Okay. Okay. I'll take it. I'll take it

09:30:48.020 --> 09:30:51.220
I'm the type to pause the game and watch a video spin feeding me on what to do

09:30:51.540 --> 09:30:55.060
Honestly small streamer did two years ago, but for both campaigns. Yes

09:30:56.340 --> 09:30:58.340
half half

09:30:58.500 --> 09:31:02.820
Now i'm going to get the game to relieve or to relive the pain

09:31:03.620 --> 09:31:05.620
You can't me

09:31:06.500 --> 09:31:11.540
Yeah, let's say half only half wait, there's no way i'll need to make a rage ASMR if that's okay

09:31:12.420 --> 09:31:14.420
I don't mean suffering like that

09:31:14.660 --> 09:31:18.500
Like honestly, I feel fine now, but I guess in the moment. I was like scary region

09:31:20.100 --> 09:31:23.140
Sorry if I scared anyone. I apologize

09:31:24.660 --> 09:31:28.020
Got some ancestral rage build up in me, I guess

09:31:31.780 --> 09:31:34.740
Me just skipping 60 percent past all the enemies honestly

09:31:35.620 --> 09:31:39.540
60 percent probably like 100 percent of the optional fights i skipped like i'm not even kidding

09:31:39.860 --> 09:31:41.860
Now you scare us more. No, you didn't scare

09:31:43.460 --> 09:31:46.420
You could do it more. You're like, well, I do have a

09:31:47.940 --> 09:31:51.780
Donut's lawn reward potentially being that rage, but yeah

09:31:52.900 --> 09:31:57.780
Stormy rage should be like you call that a willy. That's just prophetic, you know

09:32:00.900 --> 09:32:05.380
That was uh, that wasn't scary. It was the opposite. Oh the fabled Scottish rage

09:32:05.700 --> 09:32:11.140
I mean, I was scared and felt something else at the same time. I'm not gonna explain. That's actually hilarious

09:32:11.620 --> 09:32:15.700
I didn't know that had that effect. It makes me remember the banshee scream. Oh

09:32:17.380 --> 09:32:19.380
I'm not sure I can even banshee scream

09:32:19.620 --> 09:32:24.340
Like I can do it. Like my screams very loud, but I'm not gonna scream because I

09:32:24.980 --> 09:32:29.540
I think after the rage, I don't know if one of the neighbors will probably try to listen in on me right now

09:32:29.780 --> 09:32:31.780
And be like what is going on

09:32:32.900 --> 09:32:34.900
Angry hypnosis ASMR

09:32:35.060 --> 09:32:39.620
Get hypnotized. Get hypnotized. Get hypnotized. I still prefer subspace

09:32:42.500 --> 09:32:44.500
Just yelling get up

09:32:47.140 --> 09:32:53.220
Right, um, they're gonna call the police on you. I've actually wondered if it's a possibility

09:32:53.780 --> 09:32:57.540
I did speak to my neighbors at one point

09:32:58.660 --> 09:33:01.620
And I explained to them that i'm a voice actress

09:33:02.260 --> 09:33:06.500
So if they hear anything at night, don't be too worried. It's just me

09:33:09.620 --> 09:33:12.500
So my voice acting's a bit different

09:33:13.700 --> 09:33:19.140
Um, can you make a reward that you just scream Scotland forever Scotland forever

09:33:19.780 --> 09:33:24.820
Passive aggressive ASMR guys. They're like, is she okay in there? Does she need help?

09:33:26.340 --> 09:33:29.620
If someone clip that moment the clip will get but will get pretty

09:33:31.780 --> 09:33:34.820
Oh the toothbrushing I'm gonna go get my toothbrush. Okay

09:33:36.260 --> 09:33:39.540
I'll be right back. We're gonna if you want to get your toothbrush and brush your teeth

09:33:40.100 --> 09:33:42.600
Before we go off-stream you can most certainly do it

09:34:01.620 --> 09:34:03.620
I

09:34:21.380 --> 09:34:23.540
Got one out of 21 days to brush our teeth

09:34:24.820 --> 09:34:26.900
Like let me put my headset on so I can listen to the

09:34:27.620 --> 09:34:32.820
Thingy right. I've got my toothbrush. It could be a sound pack from morning alarms. Just full bag pouch

09:34:35.300 --> 09:34:38.500
I have toothpaste because I salivate a lot. I don't know about you

09:34:38.580 --> 09:34:41.700
But whenever something enters my mouth, it starts to salivate like crazy

09:34:41.940 --> 09:34:44.260
We're gonna brush our teeth and then we'll read into

09:34:45.540 --> 09:34:49.460
Yeah, mercy. I was gonna call her mousy for a second. What she ate a mouse?

09:34:50.900 --> 09:34:52.900
Are you ready?

09:34:52.900 --> 09:34:54.900
Are you ready to brush your teethies

09:34:55.380 --> 09:34:56.740
With me

09:34:56.740 --> 09:34:59.860
I'm gonna do it for two minutes. Okay. That's how long you brush your teeth

09:34:59.940 --> 09:35:02.660
So just start with the front of your teeth, right?

09:35:03.380 --> 09:35:07.780
I see you. I do you want me to mute the game so you can like really hear the brushy brush

09:35:09.380 --> 09:35:11.380
Yeah

09:35:11.780 --> 09:35:17.140
I don't think you're gonna hear it over the thing. No, I will start a two minute counter now

09:35:18.580 --> 09:35:21.860
Uh, oh, yeah, sorry. Let me mute the game

09:35:22.820 --> 09:35:27.220
I was probably gonna break now that I'm out and it's tabbed out the game. There we go

09:35:28.340 --> 09:35:30.900
Do you have a chatting? I do have chatting. Hold on

09:35:32.100 --> 09:35:35.940
Uh, whoa, that's a lot of words to speed up one. Hold on

09:35:37.540 --> 09:35:42.740
Uh, I got sorry. I've got toothpaste on my mouth right now. Pardon me. One second one second

09:35:43.220 --> 09:35:45.220
I will do that and I do this

09:35:47.140 --> 09:35:49.700
Okay, we're brushing our teethies

09:35:52.740 --> 09:35:54.740
Hmm

09:35:55.060 --> 09:35:57.940
Okay, two minutes of teeth brushing is a lot

09:36:00.420 --> 09:36:05.140
Oh, no, you can hear my background music shift back my music you're ruining it. Uh

09:36:09.220 --> 09:36:13.380
Wait two minutes so um 39 minutes past

09:36:17.220 --> 09:36:19.220
Wait make sure you do the outside first

09:36:19.540 --> 09:36:26.980
Oh my god, my shoe floor is quite all ready. Um, I don't think this is enough product paper

09:36:37.460 --> 09:36:43.140
Okay, now the bed that most people mess I'm spitting everywhere. Hold on. I need more

09:36:43.300 --> 09:36:45.540
Does that have a pillow in this room? I don't

09:36:46.660 --> 09:36:48.980
I have so much saliva coming out of my mouth

09:36:53.220 --> 09:36:59.540
Do the back of your front teeth and the back of your front bottom teeth that's the most forgotten science when you brush your teeth, okay?

09:37:06.180 --> 09:37:08.180
I'll go cook some tea

09:37:13.460 --> 09:37:15.460
I

09:37:16.980 --> 09:37:21.860
We get no cavities over here. We get no how you call them

09:37:22.580 --> 09:37:24.100
uh

09:37:24.100 --> 09:37:28.100
What what are you called haemorrhoids? No haemorrhoids. No cavities

09:37:29.460 --> 09:37:31.460
We are good with things

09:37:32.180 --> 09:37:34.260
and we go that

09:37:34.260 --> 09:37:36.820
Don't brush too hard on your gondola. We're free. I don't

09:37:37.860 --> 09:37:41.060
No root canals. We don't believe in root canals in this house

09:37:42.020 --> 09:37:44.020
root canal blood

09:37:46.820 --> 09:37:50.500
Haemorrhoids, yeah, we don't have haemorrhoids in this community

09:37:55.860 --> 09:38:00.420
Uh, I can't pull off because I don't know about the foster but we're just gonna brush our teeth in general

09:38:01.220 --> 09:38:03.940
and we're gonna do it for quite one day in a row

09:38:04.900 --> 09:38:06.660
and then

09:38:06.660 --> 09:38:15.300
Everyone's gonna have a teeth brush and have it, okay? And life is nice and easy. Oh my god. This bit is going over the paper towel. Well, it's not on a toilet roll, but uh

09:38:19.380 --> 09:38:21.620
Get the back of your wisdom tooth for you still got them

09:38:24.260 --> 09:38:26.980
No, not mouth haemorrhoids booty haemorrhoids

09:38:28.100 --> 09:38:34.180
Okay, and make sure you do circular motions. That's how you get all the the peas and poos off your teeth

09:38:37.300 --> 09:38:40.020
Mm-hmm. Okay. I think I'm almost done

09:38:45.780 --> 09:38:50.500
Is there a toothbrush out for a retailer? No, no, I don't brush in our teeth

09:38:52.660 --> 09:38:55.620
Yeah, we're getting the because we didn't know

09:38:57.700 --> 09:39:02.500
The reason why hold on I need to spit I'm gonna spit into my little mcdonald

09:39:03.460 --> 09:39:05.780
Uh, crazy. Are you ready here there?

09:39:09.140 --> 09:39:12.740
That's so much spit. I didn't need to generate that much, but I did

09:39:17.940 --> 09:39:19.940
So minty

09:39:22.740 --> 09:39:28.420
We did it. We have established day one of a 21 day habit of brushing our teeth

09:39:29.380 --> 09:39:33.940
Thank you for the drink. No, not my used toothpaste, but

09:39:38.260 --> 09:39:41.940
The only thing I don't like about toothpaste is that it keeps sitting

09:39:42.900 --> 09:39:47.460
Like it keeps in your you're not to you're not to rinse that way, but if you need to spit it out like

09:39:47.860 --> 09:39:49.860
Yeah

09:39:53.940 --> 09:39:55.460
Okay

09:39:55.460 --> 09:39:58.900
Did it we played the world's most annoying game

09:40:00.500 --> 09:40:04.020
Right, I'm going to make triple sure I am redirecting into mary

09:40:05.860 --> 09:40:08.600
Oh, I just minimized the tab by accident

09:40:10.420 --> 09:40:12.420
Oh, I'm all docky too

09:40:12.420 --> 09:40:17.060
No, that's mersey's umari stream

09:40:19.940 --> 09:40:23.700
Stony cuttage a bit of stony cuttage

09:40:25.060 --> 09:40:29.860
Thanks for the stream. You're most welcome. Thanks for hanging. Sorry for scared anyone to do apologize, but that

09:40:30.580 --> 09:40:35.380
Sorry about that old chap didn't really mean to scare you did I? Oh, but just kind of came out

09:40:36.340 --> 09:40:38.340
Kind of just came out

09:40:38.580 --> 09:40:40.820
I said what everyone was thinking and saying

09:40:41.780 --> 09:40:45.460
But uh, yeah, that game needs a hot patch for weapon drill. That's all I'm saying

09:40:47.380 --> 09:40:51.380
It won't let me open the redirect thing. Why not?

09:40:53.300 --> 09:40:59.140
YouTube you're so stinky sometimes it won't let me load so I can redirect into mary. I need to wait for it to load

09:40:59.380 --> 09:41:01.380
Okay, I did it now

09:41:01.780 --> 09:41:06.260
Oh tomorrow we have old school runesgate. Oh, I need to make my account

09:41:06.660 --> 09:41:09.460
But what do I call my account is the question?

09:41:11.780 --> 09:41:12.840
my

09:41:12.840 --> 09:41:14.140
meaning

09:41:14.140 --> 09:41:17.060
customization redirect add

09:41:18.980 --> 09:41:22.260
A difficulty right into mersey say

09:41:23.540 --> 09:41:25.540
Mersey

09:41:27.300 --> 09:41:29.300
Good better work

09:41:31.540 --> 09:41:33.540
Because

09:41:34.100 --> 09:41:40.180
Right my little reeflings. I honestly didn't think we were gonna. I honestly thought we're going to end out four hours

09:41:40.180 --> 09:41:46.020
but we've made it to almost 10 hours! Look at us go. You guys have so much stamina.

09:41:47.780 --> 09:41:51.540
Wait, wait, can I try this out? Hold on, I don't know if I can try this out right now.

09:41:52.180 --> 09:41:54.100
Is this gonna work or is this gonna break?

09:42:00.660 --> 09:42:05.060
You did so well. You make me so proud.

09:42:05.220 --> 09:42:12.820
You made such a long, unending stamina for me.

09:42:14.820 --> 09:42:15.460
Did it work?

09:42:19.460 --> 09:42:24.260
Did it work? Did I have a reverb effect when I did that? I don't know if that worked or not,

09:42:24.260 --> 09:42:29.860
or did I mess it up. What do you mean, look at your skull? You're the crazy one who took

09:42:30.820 --> 09:42:35.380
stuff. I'm feeling like it is. Yeah, the reverb was like, yes, it worked. I'm so happy.

09:42:37.220 --> 09:42:40.580
If my voice wasn't so burst, I'd do a bit more, but it's burst right now.

09:42:41.860 --> 09:42:43.460
Big burst, big burst.

09:42:46.260 --> 09:42:47.540
All hail the glowfish.

09:42:49.060 --> 09:42:54.020
It looks good when my eyes and my little shells, you can kind of see the transparency of my

09:42:54.020 --> 09:43:03.460
shells a bit better like this. Maybe you can see my reflective thing going on. It works, so

09:43:04.340 --> 09:43:10.900
wait, talk a bit. Okay, I'm glad it worked. Right, I am going to end it there without a

09:43:10.900 --> 09:43:17.380
fantastic endurance room. Tomorrow is old-school runescape, so just so you know the plan, the plan

09:43:17.380 --> 09:43:28.260
is that I'm going to make a new fresh account. You don't have to, but my idea was that we do

09:43:28.260 --> 09:43:35.940
some questing to level up, and then we basically just have fun leveling up cooking and see where

09:43:35.940 --> 09:43:44.740
it goes. But I'm a bit rubbish at quests, so it would be nice to try them together, like Cook's

09:43:44.740 --> 09:43:53.060
Assistant. I'm sure there's a Vam, that haunted house quest. I can't remember its name right now,

09:43:53.060 --> 09:44:01.780
but we're going to do those kind of questings, and then we can do some fishing together, and we'll

09:44:01.780 --> 09:44:10.740
cook the fish outside of the barbarian village, because that's free, and we can cook crayfish for

09:44:11.060 --> 09:44:17.380
free. I'm pretty sure you just need to get a net. Are you doing members? I think so, that's my only

09:44:17.380 --> 09:44:22.820
issue. I'm going to buy membership, but I'll play, like I'll go into a free-to-play lobby, and we can

09:44:22.820 --> 09:44:31.460
do the free-to-play quests, and take it from there, because I'm not entirely sure what the plan is after

09:44:32.180 --> 09:44:40.020
that. I joined you on old-school RuneScape Sheebie. I hate to break it to you, my name's

09:44:40.020 --> 09:44:51.540
Ronnie. My own tags level drain hypnosis. Yes, RuneScape membership. Time to make my account

09:44:51.540 --> 09:44:56.980
tonight too. Yes, I'll share whatever we're on, and we can all go questing together, and we can

09:44:56.980 --> 09:45:01.460
see all the reefling gang gang. I'm tired, it's pain. I know, I know what you meant. I need to go

09:45:01.460 --> 09:45:09.220
sleep. The fangs are so much easier to admire this school. Yeah. Some people thought they were

09:45:09.220 --> 09:45:15.460
vampire fangs, but they're not. You can't really see my ears, but they're slightly pointed. No,

09:45:15.460 --> 09:45:22.100
pointy ears. I haven't played in ages, I need to learn. Yeah, we can all get like the same level.

09:45:22.100 --> 09:45:27.620
We can all like hack the same yew tree when we're trying to level up our woodcraft.

09:45:28.420 --> 09:45:33.300
Are you planning on playing something that follows 76? I think that's multiplayer,

09:45:33.300 --> 09:45:37.780
but I don't know how to get you in my lobby. Like, how do I get reeflings in the lobby?

09:45:37.780 --> 09:45:44.740
Or is it like, can we make a lobby code, and it's like a server like they host? I'm not sure how 76

09:45:44.820 --> 09:45:55.620
works. Get bit by the fish, you wonder why? Would you let me bite you, reefling? That's terrible,

09:45:57.380 --> 09:46:03.300
you should let me do it. Love your choice of games so far makes me safe to see where else you got

09:46:03.300 --> 09:46:08.660
blood. Well, I'm glad you like the game so far. I'm literally just picking childhood stuff and

09:46:08.660 --> 09:46:15.220
stuff that makes me happy. So I'm glad. But yes, old school RuneScape definitely

09:46:15.940 --> 09:46:22.420
might be a recurring multiplayer for a little bit. I'm not really gonna, I'm not sure what happens

09:46:22.420 --> 09:46:29.780
when membership, what membership streams are planned. I think we'll also do, I think three

09:46:29.780 --> 09:46:39.060
membership streams a week possibly. One for react movie, one for membership

09:46:41.140 --> 09:46:48.260
multiplayer. I'll decide. Like, I wouldn't do like progression on old school RuneScape

09:46:48.260 --> 09:46:54.980
multiplayer behind a membership stream because that's not fair for those invested. So maybe,

09:46:55.140 --> 09:47:06.100
maybe, maybe. I first played again yesterday for the first time, used old school RuneScape,

09:47:06.100 --> 09:47:11.460
and a goblin got you, you got done at Goblin Village. A Dead by Daylight member stream? Yeah,

09:47:12.580 --> 09:47:18.660
I'm open to these kind of things. But yeah, one, I want to consistently have a member stream

09:47:18.900 --> 09:47:29.860
when membership's open. A react Andy, like we'll watch a movie together. And then I might also do

09:47:29.860 --> 09:47:35.940
a script writing stream. Or maybe show you some behind the scenes stuff, like maybe we write

09:47:35.940 --> 09:47:40.100
shorts. I don't know. I'm trying to think of like stuff you guys want to see. And then of course,

09:47:40.100 --> 09:47:47.220
we could just like maybe smaller games that aren't necessarily stream worthy on main. So for those of

09:47:47.220 --> 09:47:54.340
you who are unable to membership, please don't worry. I always have free content coming out and I

09:47:55.140 --> 09:48:00.500
for days, like so you know how we played needy streamer overload yesterday? Because it was only

09:48:00.500 --> 09:48:06.340
two hours long, like that's a short game. I would then come back online after maybe like a 30 minute

09:48:06.340 --> 09:48:11.220
rest and then do a membership stream. So you still get like content that day and then like I'll raid

09:48:11.220 --> 09:48:19.140
into whoever's online and like keep going. So yeah, don't worry. She streams eight days a week.

09:48:20.180 --> 09:48:25.540
Yeah, don't ever worry. And like obviously the ASMR comes out as well. That's like free on YouTube.

09:48:25.540 --> 09:48:33.700
You can watch on YouTube anytime. Script writing stream or submit scripts? Yes, it would be a bit

09:48:33.700 --> 09:48:41.460
hard to review scripts live because I would need to use euphemism and stuff. That's nice as long

09:48:41.460 --> 09:48:47.620
as you're not overworking yourself. I will make what I can handle and we can take it from there.

09:48:48.820 --> 09:48:56.580
Yeah. Get that Hermione to rewind time and overlap herself streaming honestly.

09:48:56.820 --> 09:49:04.740
True. True. I'll need to see eventually you'll be able to close your eyes and see her for a moment

09:49:04.740 --> 09:49:12.340
and you're out watching. Yeah. Always on that. There are always streams. So yes, please never worry

09:49:12.340 --> 09:49:16.900
if you don't have the money for membership because I stream every day and you can come see me every

09:49:16.900 --> 09:49:26.180
day. And yeah, I'll make sure everyone gets their money's worth either way because I don't like

09:49:26.180 --> 09:49:31.060
when streamers don't get their money's worth. Sorry, I don't like when streamers don't get their

09:49:31.060 --> 09:49:38.820
money's worth. So that's just me. So yeah. Strony is a streaming beast. I'm sure she'll have something

09:49:38.820 --> 09:49:44.340
for you. Yeah, I've got something for everyone. Or that's the plan anyway. Hopefully I got something

09:49:44.340 --> 09:49:53.060
for everyone. So you're saying is I should never become a member. Only if you are financially

09:49:53.060 --> 09:50:00.660
capable. And if you're only financially capable to support one person, I recommend doing my daughters

09:50:00.660 --> 09:50:10.180
over me. Okay. Because I always have free accessible content. Always coming out. So yeah.

09:50:12.100 --> 09:50:14.420
We love you, Strony. Please don't try my blood bliss.

09:50:15.380 --> 09:50:26.900
Yes. You're such a good girl. I will skip meals to members. Stop. No, we're not doing these jokes.

09:50:26.900 --> 09:50:32.900
I don't actually don't like these. There was like one joke that was like, oh, I'm like in a homeless

09:50:32.900 --> 09:50:38.340
shelter. And then I've given you like membership or whatever. I'm like, no, it's actually probably

09:50:38.740 --> 09:50:45.780
I am like so goofy and non serious all the time. Those kind of jokes are like, I don't like them.

09:50:48.020 --> 09:50:55.940
I sold my kidney. You definitely have a few streams that I need to rewatch. I love it though.

09:50:55.940 --> 09:51:00.900
Oh, they're long streams. You'll be rewatching for a while. But I'm good for putting on in the

09:51:00.900 --> 09:51:05.700
background for a rambling. If you ever like, I need I want to listen to something in the

09:51:05.700 --> 09:51:10.500
background, but I don't want to actually focus in. Yeah, just put the avatar stream on. And then

09:51:10.500 --> 09:51:16.100
when it comes to the RDA part, we're going to start screaming my head off. My, my, my scarier.

09:51:16.100 --> 09:51:21.940
But I'm looking forward to your first asterisk. I hope YouTube doesn't do anything. I'm a bit

09:51:21.940 --> 09:51:26.660
worried, but I'm not going to be doing ear licking or anything like that. I don't know what the heck

09:51:26.660 --> 09:51:32.820
YouTube's been playing at recently. It's making me nervous to even upload my like 1000 rewards.

09:51:32.820 --> 09:51:35.460
And there's literally nothing wrong with that fricking audios.

09:51:36.660 --> 09:51:41.540
Well, I just made a brand new or school roadscape. It's been years and I look forward to it. Yay.

09:51:41.540 --> 09:51:45.860
I will tell everyone the server when we get on tomorrow. Like I'll put it on screen and I'll

09:51:45.860 --> 09:51:51.700
say like, this is the world that we're in. And we'll start outside Lumbridge Castle where the

09:51:51.700 --> 09:51:56.820
starting point is. I'm literally going to make an account, put membership on it and then

09:51:58.100 --> 09:52:02.580
I get online for stream and we'll take it from there. I don't know what to name myself. So I

09:52:02.580 --> 09:52:07.460
need to name myself something mildly humorous, but I haven't decided yet. Maybe Scottlefish.

09:52:07.460 --> 09:52:11.540
That'd be nice. Oh, no, someone, someone. Ah, well, if you take my name, it's fine.

09:52:11.540 --> 09:52:16.580
I don't know. I'll need to think of something. Do you have a place where you'll upload?

09:52:18.420 --> 09:52:22.500
Monies for Vegemite. No, I don't have to try Vegemite.

09:52:24.180 --> 09:52:31.140
I'll get Vegemite then for the hand cam stream. Thank you reluctantly saying I'll get Vegemite

09:52:31.140 --> 09:52:37.060
in freaking toast. I don't even buy bread. I don't even get buy bread. Scottlefish is a good one.

09:52:37.060 --> 09:52:42.340
Thanks. I stole it from a leafling. Thank you for giving me that. Wait,

09:52:42.340 --> 09:52:48.740
do we need a membership on old school runescape too? Not necessarily for what we're going to do,

09:52:48.740 --> 09:52:53.620
but I think if we, I don't know yet. Like I don't know. We're going to do some quests,

09:52:53.620 --> 09:52:58.260
but I'm pretty sure like everything's behind a freaking lock and it's so expensive for old school

09:52:58.260 --> 09:53:02.660
runescape membership. I don't know if maybe there's a rich reefling that's willing to buy

09:53:02.660 --> 09:53:10.740
bonds and gift it to reeflings, but that's not like my place to ask for. It's a bit. I don't

09:53:10.740 --> 09:53:18.020
know if we have any try hard reeflings on old school runescape. Like I think I have about 12,000

09:53:18.020 --> 09:53:25.700
coins in those runescape, so I can't buy anyone a bond. Sorry. And I'm starting on a fresh account.

09:53:25.700 --> 09:53:29.300
I don't know. Maybe we can like pull our money together to buy bonds to like share to reeflings.

09:53:30.340 --> 09:53:33.620
Will there be, you're looking on Patreon. Yeah, yeah, yeah. You're looking on Patreon.

09:53:33.620 --> 09:53:39.780
It's not a problem for me. Do what we want on Patreon. Do you have a place where you upload

09:53:39.780 --> 09:53:45.620
words that you asked that and I read that out and then I didn't even reply to you? No, well,

09:53:46.740 --> 09:53:51.300
the girls have been using Twitter and like putting a go, like a download link out.

09:53:51.940 --> 09:53:55.460
Um, I don't think any of my content is going to get taken down because

09:53:57.220 --> 09:54:00.740
I know the rules. I know how to scare them.

09:54:03.620 --> 09:54:08.180
Um, so I don't think we're going to any any Oilers in chat, literally any old school runescape

09:54:08.180 --> 09:54:15.860
Oilers. We summon you. I'd like to call upon you. My membership is still six dollars because

09:54:15.860 --> 09:54:21.860
I've had an active substance. Wait, you lock in the same subscription price because you did it

09:54:21.860 --> 09:54:27.300
all the way back then, but then you do that you're looking anyway. I can look this way.

09:54:28.980 --> 09:54:36.180
She knows the cheese. Strone is never touch runescape. Unfortunately, it's like a really,

09:54:37.220 --> 09:54:41.060
it's not a hard game. It's literally point and click. If you wanted to try it for the first

09:54:41.060 --> 09:54:46.500
time, you can always start up with us. But if it's not for you, you don't have to play along.

09:54:46.500 --> 09:54:52.260
It's okay. Please don't worry. I know you've been going for nine hours. That's crazy. Look,

09:54:52.260 --> 09:54:58.340
I'm just going to yapping. Okay. I mean, I could check out Marshmallow and we can make it to 10

09:54:58.340 --> 09:55:03.220
hours if you want. Like I could put my little Marshmallow link in the chat.

09:55:03.220 --> 09:55:09.780
Ah, hee hee hee hee. Hee hee hee hee hee. Oh, my Marshmallow's in the description. Hold on.

09:55:09.780 --> 09:55:14.900
I even have, I can't even see my screen right now. My stream, not my screen. I can see my screen

09:55:14.900 --> 09:55:21.940
because it's right in front of me. Um, but hold on. How did I do this? How did I put it in chat?

09:55:24.420 --> 09:55:31.860
I am about to sneeze. Boom. Oh no. Oh no, it'd be such a shame if you guys asked me questions to

09:55:31.860 --> 09:55:40.100
round this up to a 10 hour stream. Stop. Stop it. We're right on the verge of 10 hours.

09:55:41.140 --> 09:55:45.540
Oh, we'll count down to 10 hours, shall we? Only four minutes left.

09:55:48.020 --> 09:55:53.460
Oh, I have a lot of Marshmallows. Whoopsies. Someone says, I'd love to spread your cheeks

09:55:53.780 --> 09:56:02.580
in liquefaction. Oh, I wasn't supposed to read that part out loud. Hey, I'm glad you do.

09:56:06.580 --> 09:56:11.060
God, your salty gamer rage makes me want to have hard, sweaty, angry stuff.

09:56:13.940 --> 09:56:16.180
I can't read that one either. Um,

09:56:24.420 --> 09:56:28.180
Hi, Stormy. Hopefully you're well. This is my first time using Marshmallow. Glad I could

09:56:28.180 --> 09:56:34.900
pop your Marshmallow, Cherry. I don't know if you read any of these. Oh, I read all my Marshmallows.

09:56:36.500 --> 09:56:42.580
I have a few questions. You stream so much that I'm wondering if you'll be taking a break from ASMR.

09:56:42.580 --> 09:56:48.660
No, I'm streaming ASMR in two days. No break from ASMR. I've got ASMR cards coming out as well.

09:56:49.220 --> 09:56:52.980
I just need to write the scripts and send them off. Let's go again.

09:56:56.820 --> 09:57:01.140
Yeah, I've got time for ASMR all the time because, yeah, I also got loads of managers in place.

09:57:01.140 --> 09:57:06.740
So the only thing I need to do really is be the messenger owl that sends clips to editors now

09:57:06.740 --> 09:57:11.140
and uploads stuff on behalf of the girls. Like, Mercy just wakes up and she's like,

09:57:11.140 --> 09:57:16.980
got new shorts on her channel. She has no idea. That's me doing it. Actually, Emmy has another,

09:57:16.980 --> 09:57:21.540
is that short? Yeah, Emmy has a short and she's just going to wake up and it's going to be on her

09:57:21.540 --> 09:57:30.980
channel. Already tagged up and everything for her. Yeah. Unless I didn't read that right.

09:57:35.860 --> 09:57:42.180
Yeah, I know how my ASMR is going to be. I can also upload full videos to Twitter as well if

09:57:42.180 --> 09:57:46.740
anything ever did become an issue. Like, if I did a little ASMR video. So it's not a problem.

09:57:47.380 --> 09:57:52.900
The level organization is astounding. I saw the girls aren't stressed. If the girls had to stream

09:57:54.340 --> 09:57:58.100
and they had to run around and worry about trying to get clips out and shorts out,

09:57:59.300 --> 09:58:10.580
not good combo. Not nice. Not nice. Oh, no, wait, what? Hi, Stroni. Feel a bit embarrassed.

09:58:10.740 --> 09:58:21.860
Oh, no, it's okay. Someone says they feel embarrassed because they messed up in chat at some point.

09:58:21.860 --> 09:58:27.380
Don't be silly. You're allowed to mess up in chat all you want. I can't even write in English.

09:58:28.180 --> 09:58:35.300
Like, don't worry. Like, Emmy had a script where she had to say a putty cat and I accidentally typed

09:58:35.380 --> 09:58:40.900
P-I-S-S-Y. Like, don't be afraid of making embarrassing mistakes. They're not embarrassing at all.

09:58:41.460 --> 09:58:45.300
Actually, you only feel embarrassment if you let yourself feel embarrassment or something like

09:58:45.300 --> 09:58:50.980
that. It's something about psychology. Like, if you make mistakes. Yeah.

09:58:53.460 --> 09:58:57.860
Viewer girls trying to find a non-lid marshmallow and read on stream impossible. It's honestly

09:58:57.860 --> 09:59:02.340
not that bad. I don't get that many. I honestly don't get that many. Like, the girls show me what

09:59:02.340 --> 09:59:08.500
they get and I don't seem to get, but I haven't been using the other Twitter. I think once I

09:59:08.500 --> 09:59:17.140
start using it properly, then. Yeah. Question for you. The other day we talked with Castle

09:59:17.140 --> 09:59:21.060
Green Brotherhood about how you're the mother of the girls and the reeflings are the father.

09:59:21.700 --> 09:59:24.900
Does that make Emmy or a daughter or sister or a daughter or sister?

09:59:32.660 --> 09:59:40.500
If you're a reefling, then technically daughter or sister, but if you're not a reefling, then it's

09:59:40.500 --> 09:59:49.140
just a little sister. New audio idea. Anger Scots woman mounts and rides you after being

09:59:49.700 --> 09:59:52.500
all day as a fellow Scots nun. We're hotter than here and so on.

09:59:56.660 --> 10:00:01.380
So I listened to the Assassin's Creed stream and I was happy that you remembered me. I'm

10:00:01.460 --> 10:00:08.580
like, yeah, you're like the main clipper. I actually didn't ask that question. I think there

10:00:08.580 --> 10:00:12.180
was someone else who made a few clips as well. I thought I'd be making clips and posting them,

10:00:12.180 --> 10:00:17.220
but I wasn't too sure if I could use that. Oh, no, you can go. Brother, that's your channel. You own it.

10:00:18.180 --> 10:00:24.020
You make custom content. You have made new creative content. Then guess what? Copyright is

10:00:24.020 --> 10:00:27.060
in your favor. Don't worry about copyright, okay? You don't have to worry about copyright

10:00:27.380 --> 10:00:30.660
or are you joking me? Clip the girls away. Have fun. Have that ye.

10:00:32.420 --> 10:00:37.700
I'm friends with a guy who's already itching to draw the fan art. Fan art of who? What door?

10:00:37.700 --> 10:00:42.740
What door is getting fan art? Please tell me. I want to know. I love seeing them get fan art.

10:00:48.260 --> 10:00:52.340
I like with the Olympians better, better not think about the family.

10:00:57.060 --> 10:01:05.380
What type of hypnotism is your favorite?

10:01:11.780 --> 10:01:18.740
That's too hard to answer, honestly. I like hypnoloss. I really like hypnoloss,

10:01:19.460 --> 10:01:23.780
where I'm supposed to hypnotize you, but they're backfires and I do as you say.

10:01:23.940 --> 10:01:31.620
Ah, so good. Any chance of a spiral let's play? I've never played spiral like that before.

10:01:31.620 --> 10:01:35.060
I would like to try it. I'm pretty sure they remastered them and they're like nice,

10:01:35.060 --> 10:01:38.980
calm, friendly, casual. It seems like something that's like cameo-esque,

10:01:38.980 --> 10:01:41.940
where it's like nice and simple to get through, so I think yeah.

10:01:42.820 --> 10:01:49.700
Hmm. I would say yes overall.

10:01:52.580 --> 10:01:58.180
It's the one where you go into like a difference or am I- am I messing up for subspace? I may

10:01:58.180 --> 10:02:06.900
mess you up for subspace. Hold on. Hey, story. I'm probably being a dumb dumb and I haven't

10:02:06.900 --> 10:02:10.180
found them yet, but I was wondering if you could get reference sheets for all the girls chat

10:02:10.260 --> 10:02:11.540
mascots. Yes.

10:02:14.900 --> 10:02:25.460
Amy's chat mascot is in her debut stream. You are the light in my dark. You are the beating

10:02:25.460 --> 10:02:32.900
in my heart. I showed you yesterday. I should get a reference sheet from them all put together.

10:02:32.900 --> 10:02:40.260
Maybe I'll get a tweet from the bee alone. Hmm. I can't because Amy's is in a different art style.

10:02:44.500 --> 10:02:52.100
Hmm. I know what you're asking for. I don't know the best way to do it. Maybe the discord can post

10:02:52.100 --> 10:03:00.580
them. Maybe the discord should have a reference sheet for all the girls and their mascots.

10:03:00.580 --> 10:03:07.140
That might be the solution that we can come to. Would you like to come together on a solution?

10:03:08.260 --> 10:03:11.300
Or would you like to come together? Hmm.

10:03:14.020 --> 10:03:17.620
I'm a little late but congrats on the debuts. Can't wait to see you and the rest of the girls

10:03:17.620 --> 10:03:21.380
having store. And it was nice hearing her Scottish momay again. Glad you're back.

10:03:21.940 --> 10:03:27.860
Sincerely a H little Rajesh boy. Oh yeah. It's good to be back terrorizing you.

10:03:30.900 --> 10:03:33.460
I cannot wait. I cannot wait for the A's in my stream.

10:03:35.220 --> 10:03:39.620
Thanks for being so funny, amazing and cute. You make my day better in all its aspects. I wish

10:03:39.620 --> 10:03:45.460
for you and the girls eternal success. Thank you for such kind words. That's so nice. I'm glad

10:03:45.460 --> 10:03:54.340
you somehow found me funny. Because yeah, literally, yeah, it's not good. It's hard to make jokes. Okay,

10:03:54.340 --> 10:04:02.260
my first one. Oh yeah, there's an official discord that has notification only. None of the girls

10:04:02.260 --> 10:04:13.300
are in it. So remember what I said in debut 2.0. You don't groom us. We groom you. So none of us

10:04:13.300 --> 10:04:16.900
are in it. But if you want notifications for when we go live and all that.

10:04:19.460 --> 10:04:23.460
What does it say? I need to push you against the wall holding both your hands above your head.

10:04:26.740 --> 10:04:33.060
Uh, am I supposed to say this out loud? I don't know if I'm supposed to say this out loud. I don't

10:04:33.060 --> 10:04:38.420
think I'm supposed to say that out loud at all. By the way, along with the zinc supplements,

10:04:38.420 --> 10:04:43.780
I've started eating celery for you. Oh, celery is mingin, though. Thanks for your sacrifice.

10:04:43.780 --> 10:04:47.380
They taste between boring and bitter and I don't like them, but I'll persevere for you.

10:04:48.340 --> 10:04:54.580
Are you sure you eat? Even I draw the line at celery. Sorry. It's so tasteless. I don't understand

10:04:54.580 --> 10:05:03.060
how it was even. And that celery has been genetically selected to produce like that.

10:05:03.060 --> 10:05:08.180
The only way celery is redeemable is in a soup because it's got stock and completely covers

10:05:08.180 --> 10:05:18.180
the taste of celery. Your dedication is appreciated. Celery sucks. Celery is a peanut butter delivery

10:05:18.180 --> 10:05:26.260
device. Oh, like a spoon. Celials worse though. I'm going to zail them up,

10:05:26.260 --> 10:05:33.940
form down. Hold on, I'm just grabbing some water. I need to hydrate.

10:05:42.340 --> 10:05:51.540
I have been hydrated. Oh no, it's 2pm already. Oh, it's my bedtime soon.

10:05:52.500 --> 10:05:59.060
Oh no. Wait, no. Actually, it's good that it's my bedtime soon because that means I get to be on

10:05:59.060 --> 10:06:03.700
old school Rinscape with you even. Wait, actually, I just realized we're doing a first freaking

10:06:03.700 --> 10:06:11.140
stream snipe game tomorrow. Oh my God. Why did that not register? We've literally been talking

10:06:11.140 --> 10:06:15.140
about old school Rinscape. We get to play our first freaking stream snipe and I get to see you all.

10:06:16.020 --> 10:06:21.940
Ah, oh my God. Okay, I'm an idiot. I'm an idiot. I'm an idiot. Oh my God, it's tomorrow. I want to

10:06:21.940 --> 10:06:27.940
go to sleep right now. I'm not going to be able to sleep. It's like Christmas. It's like Christmas.

10:06:28.500 --> 10:06:33.620
I'm going to be so excited. Are we all going to like have code names? I don't know. Should we have

10:06:33.620 --> 10:06:40.420
theme names? Are we all just going to name our names like how we are? Five. I'm just going to see

10:06:40.420 --> 10:06:45.780
this right now. Someone says hopefully you will play five hours. Five hours? No, we're doing 12

10:06:45.780 --> 10:06:52.020
hours. Okay, 12 hours or go home. So I'm going to give everyone as much of a chance as possible to

10:06:52.020 --> 10:06:58.500
show up in old school Rinscape. I will put the world we are on in the top corner or something

10:06:58.500 --> 10:07:06.500
so you can see it any minute. What is Rinscape? Rinscape is an old web game. Is that a web game?

10:07:06.500 --> 10:07:11.940
I don't know if it's a web game now. But yeah, if you have trouble falling asleep,

10:07:11.940 --> 10:07:19.220
just look in a mirror and hypnotize yourself. True. I'm aware that's below your average.

10:07:20.340 --> 10:07:26.660
The most Rinscape players average on the game. Oh, do they had enough after five hours? Me just

10:07:26.660 --> 10:07:31.380
like, right, let's do a fashion show. Everyone go to the Grand Exchange and get some pretty cold

10:07:31.460 --> 10:07:38.020
dawn. I'm going to rate who has the best. Oh wait, there's houses and can I bring you to my house

10:07:38.020 --> 10:07:44.900
in Rinscape? Right, I don't know how membership works, but I'm pretty sure you can get house

10:07:44.900 --> 10:07:51.700
in Rinscape because I remember watching someone play hide and seek in Rinscape and he was like

10:07:51.700 --> 10:07:57.300
chasing around like the people in stream. We can play hide and seek in tag in Rinscape.

10:07:58.100 --> 10:08:07.620
Oh my god. Yeah. And it has this one's go. Oh my god. Oh my god, could we play hide and seek?

10:08:08.260 --> 10:08:12.900
I want to be the seeker and I get to touch you all. And if you're touched, you have to like go in

10:08:12.900 --> 10:08:20.820
the corner until the winner is crowned. We really are getting crowned. I've never played Rinscape,

10:08:20.820 --> 10:08:23.620
but whatever hint you're describing, it sounds very close to Oji Cup Penguin.

10:08:23.700 --> 10:08:32.820
Oh my god, I want to play tag. And I'll be like, right, run away from, oh no, who's that? Oh no,

10:08:32.820 --> 10:08:35.940
but we won't be able to know who's that. So we can go to the hide and seek. Okay.

10:08:37.220 --> 10:08:39.940
Shawnee, if you phrase it like that, everyone will like touch them.

10:08:41.220 --> 10:08:46.580
No, no, you're not wanting to get caught. What if we use our Rinscape beds next to each other?

10:08:47.540 --> 10:08:54.020
I sadly can't start a new game. I already have three games that take full time and one of them

10:08:54.020 --> 10:09:00.500
I play. Well, World of Warcraft. Someone was like, well, I say something. They were like,

10:09:00.500 --> 10:09:04.820
I'm no longer doing wow raids to watch your streams. I'm like, no, your girls are going to be so

10:09:04.820 --> 10:09:10.100
annoyed at you. Like I've had the chance to play World of War. What was the expansion called?

10:09:10.820 --> 10:09:18.820
It was like the second last expansion of wow. And I had a chance to play it. And apparently,

10:09:18.820 --> 10:09:25.060
people role play in this place called Goldheim. And I'm like, should we play wow and just like

10:09:25.060 --> 10:09:32.260
be like really weird role players that I like. Shadowlands. I think it's Shadowlands is why

10:09:32.260 --> 10:09:40.020
played. No, not the battle. Not the battle about the dwarf. Oh, okay, brain needs to catch up. Hold

10:09:40.020 --> 10:09:46.260
on, hold on, brain needs to catch up. Not the battle of Azeroth. Goldchart and something like that.

10:09:46.260 --> 10:09:51.140
Yeah, the gold chart and we should all go role play there. I would like make like make people

10:09:51.140 --> 10:09:57.460
really uncomfortable and we're all just like role playing. Wow, ascension is a thing. I don't know

10:09:57.460 --> 10:10:09.460
what that is. The elf and her dwarves. Oh, wait, what would we be? Can I be a cute night elf and

10:10:09.460 --> 10:10:19.700
then you guys could all be wargans for some unwritten reason? Pop Tropica is still a thing too.

10:10:19.940 --> 10:10:21.940
Pop Tropica.

10:10:25.460 --> 10:10:34.020
Guild Wars 2 role plays were at, I don't know, Wink Wank? Really Wink Wank? Oh, wait, wait, wait,

10:10:34.020 --> 10:10:42.900
do that again. Wink Wank? Really Wink Wank? Did that, did that work? Oh, no, it doesn't work.

10:10:42.900 --> 10:10:48.820
Wait, for some reason the sound works on my freaking game. Hold on, we're like Wink Wank.

10:10:54.260 --> 10:10:57.780
Here we go. Wait, that played twice. I don't know why it doesn't do it on the screen. That's

10:10:57.780 --> 10:11:04.820
strange. It's the same instance. Oh well. Sorry, that took me so long to do. We should be orcs and

10:11:04.820 --> 10:11:10.980
you should be an elf for no reason at all. Oh gee, I sure wouldn't love to be overpowered.

10:11:11.220 --> 10:11:15.540
I take a drink of hydration of water. To hydrate.

10:11:19.460 --> 10:11:25.060
Hi, good morrow, dear silly cuttlefish. I'm very sleepy, so I'mma be brief.

10:11:25.700 --> 10:11:28.420
I absolutely adore watching yours. That's okay, shame! And today,

10:11:29.620 --> 10:11:34.420
and it's been so unreal to watch you be all silly again, I absolutely adore you and I hope all of

10:11:34.420 --> 10:11:41.300
you are girls and I absolutely adore you and your hopes for the veal or girls and everything and I

10:11:41.300 --> 10:11:45.700
hope you all make it happen for your happiness as mine and I'm always kicking my feet, blushing,

10:11:45.700 --> 10:11:53.700
tapping and stuff. Thank you for making, thank you for such kind words. Got you twirling your hair

10:11:53.700 --> 10:11:59.220
and stuff, huh? Got you twirling your hair and stream. Are you and the girls ever going to play

10:11:59.220 --> 10:12:06.900
Minecraft together? Yes, July is when the group Minecraft server goes up. Amy, definitely the

10:12:06.900 --> 10:12:12.500
most Minecraft-y out of us all. I don't know how the scale goes, but I'mma confidently say I'm

10:12:12.500 --> 10:12:19.620
probably the lowest on the scale of like Minecraft knowledge. All I know is that apparently the mob

10:12:19.620 --> 10:12:27.300
votes are the vote, people voted for the freaking stealth phantom things. If you don't sleep for

10:12:27.300 --> 10:12:32.500
more than two days they attack you through walls and stuff and I know that was the mob vote and

10:12:32.500 --> 10:12:40.260
apparently the mod vote is also rigged because it doesn't make sense. I don't know, but I don't

10:12:40.260 --> 10:12:48.660
know if it's rigged. I think it's because people don't understand like kids will vote and kids don't

10:12:48.660 --> 10:12:57.140
vote for things that are like good. They vote for what kids want and maybe that's why the votes are

10:12:57.140 --> 10:13:05.380
always so skewed. Yeah, mob vote's terrible. I tried and voted for the crab. Wasn't there not

10:13:05.380 --> 10:13:10.420
like an alternative? I can't remember. I assume Mercy and her motion sickness might be a bit

10:13:10.420 --> 10:13:20.820
of a struggle. Yes, Mercy... I would love... it's hard. I don't know if Minecraft would set it off,

10:13:20.900 --> 10:13:27.220
although she can change the camera so it might not affect her motion sickness.

10:13:27.220 --> 10:13:31.700
I'll need to ask a bit more about it because I don't have it. I don't know what kind of like

10:13:31.700 --> 10:13:37.300
sets it off all the time. Kids running around... I can't believe it. Kids ruling the way that kids

10:13:37.300 --> 10:13:41.940
game isn't used. Terrible. I hydrate again. Oh my voice is feeling it Mr. Krabs.

10:13:44.820 --> 10:13:48.900
I'm pretty sure you can move out your camera angle. Can you not on Minecraft or am I just

10:13:48.900 --> 10:13:56.100
making that up? Does it look cool? Never stuck with him forever. Yeah, I will agree. The design

10:13:56.100 --> 10:14:12.500
of it looked cool but its actual thing in game is rubbish. Like rubbish. What does that mean?

10:14:13.060 --> 10:14:18.260
What are you asking me? Forgot to send this. Thank you mommy for all your girls. So cute.

10:14:18.740 --> 10:14:22.420
I wanted to mention that. So many people are like thanking me for like

10:14:23.380 --> 10:14:28.340
the girls being the girls. I'm like no, you thank the girls. I didn't do anything.

10:14:29.060 --> 10:14:34.660
If you're thanking me for picking them. Again, that's the girls that did that. It was through

10:14:34.660 --> 10:14:43.220
either their introduction or their own content. It's the girls. It's the girls you should be

10:14:43.220 --> 10:14:52.500
thanking. Not me, you goofy gobers. It's the girls. So thank the girls. The reason people

10:14:52.500 --> 10:14:57.460
say that the vote is rigged is because Compton created tell people to vote for a certain more.

10:14:57.460 --> 10:15:04.340
Therefore, I picked the vote. Compton. Compton. Who's Compton? Sounds like a town in London

10:15:04.340 --> 10:15:10.420
somewhere. Or a bottle. Sorry, a bottle in London. You picked an amazing bunch though. They're all

10:15:10.420 --> 10:15:18.580
awesome. I'm glad you agree. There'd be nothing short of perfect. As in they are perfect. That's

10:15:18.580 --> 10:15:23.940
how you say they're perfect, right? They're nothing. They have been nothing but perfect.

10:15:23.940 --> 10:15:26.900
Yeah. That's how you say it. Yeah. Okay. Man of heat and ghosts.

10:15:27.540 --> 10:15:41.060
Wait. Oh, no. Right. You guys are welcome to laugh. I think this is terminology I'm not familiar with.

10:15:41.780 --> 10:15:52.340
If I see a pest trooper, what's a hollow live home? What's a needy male? What?

10:15:52.740 --> 10:15:59.540
What's that? Am I being dumb? I don't know what that is.

10:16:01.940 --> 10:16:05.540
They're asking, do I have, am I able to shadow ban them?

10:16:08.180 --> 10:16:12.180
Maybe this, no. Maybe this, no. I don't quite understand it. Sorry.

10:16:12.500 --> 10:16:30.260
Why is someone sending me a detailed, no. Is this far and on? Is this toilet bowl far and on?

10:16:31.780 --> 10:16:38.420
Oh, ye gods, how I wish for that most delightful of noise to curl into mine deprived ears. With

10:16:38.420 --> 10:16:45.380
such intensity, I yearn to experience the sound of Strawny's splutter gutter as it

10:16:46.260 --> 10:16:57.380
flaps a flutter, the noise like a walrus burping up butter, the harps and splurts like a chorus of

10:16:57.380 --> 10:17:07.140
angels unleashing their art, the pungent bass bass that can only be played alongside golden harps to

10:17:07.140 --> 10:17:13.700
shepherd the dead whom has come and died when hearing Strawny's fart. That is so toilet. There's

10:17:13.700 --> 10:17:22.900
no way you're not toilet bowl and on. Just for very quick lore, someone ages ago sent me a thing

10:17:22.900 --> 10:17:27.540
and was like, I really want to hear you fart on the toilet and I'm like, what? You want it to be

10:17:27.540 --> 10:17:35.060
amplified by echoing off the rim of the toilet and from then he was crowned freaking toilet as bowl

10:17:35.060 --> 10:17:42.580
annulment. I don't want to miss what cursed filth hath the eye brought upon, hath the eye

10:17:42.580 --> 10:17:49.700
brought upon these lands. Hi, my love, I want to, hmm, in me right in front of you while you

10:17:50.340 --> 10:17:56.660
hold her hand. Careful what you wish for, you might be getting it. You might be getting it

10:17:56.820 --> 10:18:05.620
all the girls actually, possibly. There's, hmm, yes, I need to, I need to see you.

10:18:08.820 --> 10:18:14.340
He wants to hear the reverb full acoustics, literally. Well, they wanted to hear that

10:18:14.340 --> 10:18:22.660
chock. You're only allowed to hold hands with the harps, even better. I have a plan for my

10:18:22.660 --> 10:18:29.380
Dora Thon, but it requires a team effort and it's quite a lot to ask the girls like, oh, Dora

10:18:29.380 --> 10:18:32.580
Thons are like, you need to help each other out, type them, but I'm going to try my best to make it

10:18:32.580 --> 10:18:42.660
as easy as possible. But I would like to release a certain audio and basically, in it, I give you

10:18:42.660 --> 10:18:51.940
a pill that negates any need for a pause champ, if you will. And then I take you door by door.

10:18:53.380 --> 10:19:00.660
It's so messed up saying how loud. But yeah, and I tell you like all the good things and encouragement.

10:19:01.300 --> 10:19:13.860
I need to, I need to let it cook. Okay. I need to let it cook. And I need a Dora Thon in the

10:19:13.860 --> 10:19:18.500
first place to even start cooking it up. But we ain't there yet. We ain't doing that. We aren't

10:19:18.500 --> 10:19:25.380
even on that part. Well, that's a very silly pill. Lord, grant me strength. Would you please give us

10:19:25.380 --> 10:19:34.100
a heads up for when it comes out so we can save? Oh my God, mon. Please do that. She kicked a whole

10:19:34.100 --> 10:19:44.660
six course dinner. I'm a gourmet chef. Well, if I get 99 cooking on RuneScape, then yes, I am a chef.

10:19:45.300 --> 10:19:51.380
Confirmed. Any plans for haptic support? I keep getting asked, but I don't know what it is. I don't

10:19:51.380 --> 10:19:56.260
know what I need to do to the audience to make that happen. I don't know if it's like I run it

10:19:56.260 --> 10:20:05.060
through a data thing or what? I don't know. I don't know. I'm too dumb. Hold on, I'm gonna

10:20:05.060 --> 10:20:14.420
fix my calibration and I'm wiggling a bit too much. Okay, calibration, calibrate it.

10:20:14.820 --> 10:20:22.180
Are we cooking in RuneScape something? Yes. I don't know how to make money in RuneScape,

10:20:22.180 --> 10:20:28.340
but we're going to be buying lobster so we can level up. If not, we'll use Barbarian Village and

10:20:28.340 --> 10:20:35.140
we'll pick up all the salmon, all the bought strobe and cook. Shawnee, do you reply to

10:20:35.140 --> 10:20:44.260
marshmallows privately? No, I don't. I reply on stream or I put together a mosaic. A mosaic?

10:20:44.420 --> 10:20:50.740
Is that the correct word? Where I put all the pictures together and post it. But I've only

10:20:50.740 --> 10:20:57.140
done that once. I should maybe do it again sometime. And then I can talk about all the naughty things.

10:20:58.340 --> 10:20:58.660
Why?

10:21:01.780 --> 10:21:05.940
Here's a funny story about three medieval kingdoms. I'm scared to click on this piece.

10:21:06.660 --> 10:21:14.580
Hey, Staroni, I love your work. Any chance to do a belly button camsuit? No, you don't

10:21:14.580 --> 10:21:19.060
like to see my belly button. Why would you want to see my belly button? I don't like my belly button.

10:21:19.780 --> 10:21:28.180
Belly button? Belly button? Is that your choice? Is that your choice of finishing location?

10:21:28.740 --> 10:21:33.060
Hmm, your choice? Interesting.

10:21:35.940 --> 10:21:38.420
Good night, Staroni. Just thought you'd want to know I'm going to jet.

10:21:40.420 --> 10:21:44.020
I can't read the end of that. Enjoy your nighttime routine. Sleep well.

10:21:45.940 --> 10:21:47.860
Oh my. Oh my.

10:21:50.820 --> 10:21:53.300
Hi, Staroni. I want to hold your body again.

10:21:58.260 --> 10:22:06.660
Oh. I can't read any of these. There's a free game called Fantasy Star Online 2.

10:22:06.660 --> 10:22:10.180
I haven't played it in years, but every weekend there's a Hatsune Miku concert.

10:22:10.180 --> 10:22:14.260
That's so specific. Why is there a Hatsune Miku concert in the middle of Fantasy Star Online 2?

10:22:15.140 --> 10:22:18.900
I'm thinking Miku, Miku, Ui, Ui.

10:22:21.060 --> 10:22:25.220
Blue air, blue eyes, hiding in your wi-fi.

10:22:25.940 --> 10:22:29.140
Staroni, I just want to let you know for old school runescape, being on a member's world is

10:22:29.140 --> 10:22:32.980
almost a requirement for any skill training. You can quest together with people and free to play,

10:22:32.980 --> 10:22:36.340
but the gameplay is limited. Oh, but it's so expensive.

10:22:39.620 --> 10:22:47.060
Stop reading them out loud. Ah, I like reading them. It's only me, or is it me, seeing a lot more

10:22:47.940 --> 10:22:49.940
things than she would.

10:22:52.420 --> 10:22:56.500
Eh? Are they both on? No, they're not online right now. You mean in the ASMRs?

10:23:03.140 --> 10:23:07.380
People are bored. Bold on Marshmallow. Yeah, that's the best part.

10:23:08.500 --> 10:23:14.180
They tell me everything they want, and I give them everything they want.

10:23:15.140 --> 10:23:16.420
That's a good exchange.

10:23:20.020 --> 10:23:20.900
Can you please say...

10:23:24.980 --> 10:23:27.300
What are you gonna use it for if I say it?

10:23:28.980 --> 10:23:31.620
And you didn't tell me what tone to say it in either.

10:23:34.100 --> 10:23:37.300
You didn't tell me what tone to say the sentence in either.

10:23:40.020 --> 10:23:42.500
I need to think. How would you want me to say it?

10:23:44.580 --> 10:23:49.940
Mmm, I lost the game. This? Is that the tone you wanted this?

10:23:51.380 --> 10:23:56.100
If you want me to say something, you need to give me tone. You need to give me the emotion.

10:24:07.140 --> 10:24:09.620
Wait, strong enough. Wait, what?

10:24:09.940 --> 10:24:10.440
What?

10:24:13.460 --> 10:24:19.700
Wait, is that that goofy game where if someone says you lost the game, you've lost us?

10:24:20.420 --> 10:24:27.220
Wait, is that what it? Rip game players. Wait, what does it mean? It's a silly game,

10:24:27.220 --> 10:24:31.620
right, where people say I lost the game and then you lose it until you win it on your streak?

10:24:32.420 --> 10:24:34.500
If you think about the game you lost, okay.

10:24:35.380 --> 10:24:39.540
The only objective of the game is to not think about the game.

10:24:39.540 --> 10:24:48.420
Oh, okay. Oh, I'm sorry. Oh, I just made you all lose. I'm sorry. I wasn't thinking that far ahead.

10:24:48.420 --> 10:24:52.740
I'm sorry. I didn't think that far ahead.

10:24:55.300 --> 10:24:59.300
Can I suggest something secret totally say so confession maros to read on stream?

10:24:59.300 --> 10:25:01.860
Yeah, you can like, you can literally type in the maros right now.

10:25:02.180 --> 10:25:09.300
Can I send it like this? Did that work? It did. Yeah, you can just put it in there.

10:25:09.300 --> 10:25:12.260
And if you want me to say something, just put that emotion and then like,

10:25:12.260 --> 10:25:16.180
like quotation marks. I'll also take requests here in the ASMR stream as well.

10:25:16.180 --> 10:25:20.020
So if you ever wanted me to hear it, kind of whispered a bit on a different microphone,

10:25:20.020 --> 10:25:27.940
because this is an SMB7 I'm using. At least we lost this drawing. I heard about this like

10:25:27.940 --> 10:25:36.180
25 years ago in elementary. My discipline. I'm sorry. Okay, I distract you. I will say other things.

10:25:38.500 --> 10:25:42.500
Did you see the refling zip up hoodie design? Maro, I send other deer. What do we bear?

10:25:43.060 --> 10:25:47.300
Oh, if you've got those, if you've got those kind of pictures, please send on Twitter.

10:25:47.300 --> 10:25:54.900
But I will say my Twitter tags are freaking working. I'm trying to find this freaking artwork

10:25:54.980 --> 10:25:59.140
on Smuttle and it doesn't show up. I don't know why it doesn't show up.

10:26:03.060 --> 10:26:05.700
What's your favorite type of hypnotic induction to use?

10:26:09.220 --> 10:26:18.500
I think, I like repeated pattern. Come to the ASMR stream and I'll show you what I like. Okay,

10:26:19.220 --> 10:26:25.140
deal. Huh? Are you going to show up? And I'll show you what I like. She will like.

10:26:25.860 --> 10:26:30.100
And people are going to judge me, but I like it. So I'll do what I like.

10:26:30.820 --> 10:26:33.940
Sometimes the Strony is a good girl. Hell yeah, a good girl.

10:26:35.460 --> 10:26:39.700
You, oh, I'm good at advertising. Okay, I'm in. I'm in. Hey Strony, here's the song.

10:26:39.780 --> 10:26:46.340
Safe for work, Mario. Do you have a throne? I do, but I've unlinked it because

10:26:48.420 --> 10:26:53.380
I have everything I need now that I've got my reef links. I don't need a single thing else.

10:26:56.820 --> 10:27:02.580
And that's the 12th. I don't need anything. So I've unlinked my throne.

10:27:03.460 --> 10:27:10.260
I'm going to say how many triples have you received so far? Um, not a lot.

10:27:10.260 --> 10:27:14.660
The girls are getting a lot more than me. I think the reef links are a little shy,

10:27:14.660 --> 10:27:18.900
a little shy, a little scared. Will you and the girls be able to

10:27:18.900 --> 10:27:25.140
yourself and members streams? Most likely, yes. Strony, does it make you happy when people send

10:27:25.140 --> 10:27:31.140
you the spicy messages? Please let me. Please tell me all the scenarios you want to do to me.

10:27:32.580 --> 10:27:40.580
Are there any games where there's an alt path you haven't tried?

10:27:42.980 --> 10:27:47.060
I can't think of any off the top of my head. I normally probably like

10:27:47.060 --> 10:27:52.740
game starts, game ends. I never pick the bad team if there's a bad side. Stinky.

10:27:54.900 --> 10:27:57.780
Unless you count the companions in Skyrim.

10:27:58.100 --> 10:28:05.140
Does anyone here like the companions in Skyrim?

10:28:06.420 --> 10:28:09.940
Oh wait, I'm on the fricking wrong thing. Sorry, hold on. Let me try that again.

10:28:09.940 --> 10:28:12.020
Does anyone here like the companions in Skyrim?

10:28:15.380 --> 10:28:18.660
Yeah, exactly. That's what I thought. That's what I thought. No one likes them.

10:28:18.660 --> 10:28:24.820
Companion. Stinky. Yeah, exactly.

10:28:26.900 --> 10:28:32.260
You think they're fine? I don't, I never, although the first time you play it, it's like,

10:28:32.260 --> 10:28:40.740
wow, really good, but the fricking on Xbox, the girl always glitches out and disappears in the

10:28:40.740 --> 10:28:46.420
middle of the map and she never comes back. Hi, just a time waster for cute fish.

10:28:48.820 --> 10:28:52.900
Someone says, someone says, wife? Husband?

10:28:56.980 --> 10:29:03.300
Have you heard a joke about afar? It stinks. You know what? You're done. Wait, why?

10:29:04.100 --> 10:29:08.100
Oh, there's no background. No, no, no background. What's going on here? Why the heck do you know work?

10:29:19.300 --> 10:29:28.420
Oh, right, I think that's all the marshmallows that I can, I refresh and it's just gone up my quiver.

10:29:33.540 --> 10:29:36.980
Oh my god, I love you and the girls so much. I created a Twitter account just to follow the

10:29:36.980 --> 10:29:41.540
six of you. I hate that I had to turn into it. I know. Thank you for going through it. It's such a

10:29:41.540 --> 10:29:45.860
pain. My account keeps getting fricking locked and it keeps making me prove that I'm not bought over

10:29:45.860 --> 10:29:49.380
and over and over and over and over and over and over again. Look, I just want to look at

10:29:49.380 --> 10:29:54.980
small fish. I want to, and then I want to go to sleep, you know what I'm saying? Hi, Johnny.

10:29:54.980 --> 10:29:58.580
Oh, sorry, I don't know why I gave you that voice. I'm so sorry. I apologize. Hi,

10:29:58.580 --> 10:30:03.460
Stronny. I woke up in a Euro time zone and found out the party was still going 10 hours in the

10:30:03.460 --> 10:30:09.700
avatar stream. Hell yeah. I really admire your energy and autism as you call it. Thank you.

10:30:09.700 --> 10:30:14.180
If you want to play old school RuneScape tomorrow, we are going to be live for 12 hours. Cheeky

10:30:14.260 --> 10:30:20.100
endurance stream. What's that? I stream more in one week than the average we should have

10:30:20.100 --> 10:30:30.500
done in a month. I'll wear that with pride. So I don't have snot coming out my nose. I'm drinking

10:30:30.500 --> 10:30:40.340
water. Your wishes. Hi, Stronny. Thanks for being a butt. So,

10:30:42.740 --> 10:30:53.620
okay. You can finish the rest. Stronny, guess what? You just took my marshmallow

10:30:53.620 --> 10:30:58.100
of engineering. Get plapped. Get plapped. Get plapped. Looking forward to the old school

10:30:58.100 --> 10:31:02.580
RuneScape. I also recommend Final Fantasy if you want more MMOs. Also, would you accept

10:31:02.580 --> 10:31:09.380
script ideas, fan-made scripts? Yes, I would. I don't have a problem. There may, at a later

10:31:09.380 --> 10:31:16.660
date, not now, not in this month, things need to settle where we can take official script submissions.

10:31:16.660 --> 10:31:25.700
However, if we are aware to take subscriptions submissions for audios purposes, sadly, you

10:31:25.700 --> 10:31:30.820
have to fully hand over the rights. So we have the right to monetize. We have ownership.

10:31:30.820 --> 10:31:37.540
We're happy to give credit. I think, I don't know if there's going to be a problem giving credit.

10:31:37.540 --> 10:31:44.020
I haven't thought that far ahead at the moment. But there's a lot of issues and it's quite a shame

10:31:44.020 --> 10:31:49.060
and it's really hard to iron out at this point in time. But once the dust settles and things get

10:31:50.020 --> 10:31:52.660
better. Wait, get plapped. What are you doing to us? Blap, blap, blap, blap, blap.

10:31:54.980 --> 10:31:59.220
Do you still have love for the big boy wiflings out there? I can't help but notice a

10:31:59.220 --> 10:32:05.140
lane in your lore video. Yes.

10:32:08.340 --> 10:32:11.780
There's just something I've got to say. You're as beautiful as the day I lost you.

10:32:11.780 --> 10:32:18.740
Oh, thank you. That's how to train your dragon. That's one of the only books I write as a child.

10:32:18.740 --> 10:32:23.220
I think I read like three books as a childhood. And one of them was how to train your dragon.

10:32:24.340 --> 10:32:32.740
I don't know how I read a book, honestly, but I did it. She's dunking us in the water.

10:32:34.340 --> 10:32:39.380
The books were so good. Literally one of the only books I read as a child. I've read more books

10:32:39.380 --> 10:32:47.380
this year than I have in my entire life, which is crazy. I'd pretend that I can do book reviews,

10:32:47.380 --> 10:32:50.660
but I'm not even smart enough for that. I'm currently trying to get through the Handmaiden's

10:32:50.660 --> 10:32:56.420
Tale. I actually am enjoying the Handmaiden's Tale. I'm like a few chapters in, but I don't

10:32:56.420 --> 10:33:01.540
know if people find this cheating, but I have to have the book read to me or I can't read it.

10:33:02.980 --> 10:33:07.620
This sounds really bad, but it takes up too much brain power to read the words manually,

10:33:07.620 --> 10:33:15.860
so I read along whilst being spoken to by TTS voice. And I can speed it up like super fast.

10:33:16.820 --> 10:33:20.420
Oh, thank you for the raid. How did your stream go?

10:33:22.340 --> 10:33:26.260
How did your stream go rain? Oh, you might be tired, so don't feel forced to talk.

10:33:26.260 --> 10:33:28.580
Don't feel forced to talk if you're a tired little barbie.

10:33:30.820 --> 10:33:34.180
I should have said background music. It's really quiet in the stream. I don't know if it's

10:33:34.740 --> 10:33:39.460
maybe nice. I hope your stream was good. Endurance streamer, creative director,

10:33:39.460 --> 10:33:43.060
and so has time to... I've not read any books since debut. I can tell you that much.

10:33:43.060 --> 10:33:47.940
But hi, Raiders. I'm Strony Cuttlews from Via Lure. I'm really inappropriate,

10:33:47.940 --> 10:33:51.460
so I do apologize if I'm new. You're a cup of tea, and I'm also Scottish, so I'm super hard to

10:33:51.460 --> 10:33:57.380
understand, but thanks for hanging out anyway. Which is... I hope your stream went fantastic.

10:33:57.380 --> 10:34:01.540
Please rest up after your stream. I'm sure you're tired, and last thing you want to do is get

10:34:01.540 --> 10:34:06.900
bombarded with loads of questions from the person you have kindly rated into. So I thank you kindly,

10:34:06.900 --> 10:34:15.300
rain cloud, and I hope you have a fantastic rest after your game. Game? Maybe that too.

10:34:16.260 --> 10:34:23.140
Never know. May not be a game. She may not be... Entry all in one breath. She's got lungs.

10:34:25.300 --> 10:34:29.940
Strony looking to push 11 hours at this rate. Should we? Should we just yap and then make

10:34:30.020 --> 10:34:36.740
it another 12 hours? Why is the raid message wait? Wait, I saw it as wait as well. Like,

10:34:36.740 --> 10:34:40.500
I could hardly read, but I had to scroll over. I mean, if I make another cup of tea,

10:34:41.380 --> 10:34:46.420
we could in theory make it 12 hours again, and we just like... And we can just talk,

10:34:46.420 --> 10:34:50.500
and I can ask you questions, and then you ask me questions, and then I'm going to ramble about

10:34:50.500 --> 10:34:56.580
something, and then you distract me. And then we're going to another ramble. Do you want that?

10:34:56.580 --> 10:35:01.700
Yes, please? Oh, okay, okay, okay, okay. Her favorite form of introduction is tying you

10:35:01.700 --> 10:35:08.260
into the cannonball fall streak. The yabba-nay. You feel yourself getting so sleepy, don't you,

10:35:08.260 --> 10:35:17.700
little leaf-ling? Yeah, it's okay. Let's sleep and brace you slowly, okay?

10:35:18.420 --> 10:35:29.220
Shhh. And then here for 13 and then 14. I mark my words when and if YouTube ever

10:35:29.220 --> 10:35:36.980
fix VODs, 14 hour streams. Not even kidding. I can't get enough of you. I can't. I can't

10:35:36.980 --> 10:35:47.620
get enough of you. And when we do Elden Ring, I am incredibly tempted to possibly figure

10:35:48.420 --> 10:35:55.620
do a 12 hour and then raid into a six hour afterwards. I don't know. It's plausible. I'll

10:35:55.620 --> 10:36:02.340
be a tired bean. I don't know. I wish we could get 14 hours. 14 is the like perfect slot of like,

10:36:02.340 --> 10:36:09.380
I can still get a full night's rest. Lord, inject the Scottish lass. Lord, if you can

10:36:09.380 --> 10:36:15.940
hear me right now, inject the Scottish lass into my veins. Scott Fish is too powerful.

10:36:15.940 --> 10:36:20.580
Thank God it's daytime where I live. I don't have to sleep. Stop. I can't be more addicted

10:36:21.460 --> 10:36:30.340
than I am. You're too good, Strawny. I'm coming for you. Trying to kill us. Thank you.

10:36:31.540 --> 10:36:37.300
Do rest if you need to rest. Never worry, okay? Strawny, I've got to go to sleep. Can you please

10:36:37.300 --> 10:36:42.100
show us those pretty pink swirls? Oh, now that I'm so close to you, I absolutely can. Hold on.

10:36:43.060 --> 10:36:49.300
Uh, will I go in? Wow, I'm reacting to myself. Please don't react. There. Okay, that's more like

10:36:49.300 --> 10:36:56.740
me. Hold on. Let me put chat behind me just for a moment. Okay, let's see if I can do this properly.

10:36:57.540 --> 10:37:04.420
Sorry, I'm so close. Okay, let me move my water out of the way so I can at least attempt to do

10:37:04.420 --> 10:37:10.340
something mildly professional for once in my life. Okay? Once in my life, I did something

10:37:10.420 --> 10:37:11.780
a little bit. Oh, maybe a little bit.

10:37:18.740 --> 10:37:30.100
It's okay to be sleeping. It's been a while since you've rested. Well, really, okay?

10:37:30.980 --> 10:37:32.980
Shhh.

10:37:35.860 --> 10:37:42.740
Slowly, your phone. Slow, slow, slow.

10:37:46.020 --> 10:37:52.820
And your muscles relax. Slow, slow, slow.

10:37:53.620 --> 10:38:04.260
And your brain is quiet. Slow, slow, slow.

10:38:06.980 --> 10:38:12.500
Good name, but don't be stingy. Until the morning.

10:38:12.580 --> 10:38:24.020
Did I do it? Did I do it right? Slow, slow, slow.

10:38:25.220 --> 10:38:30.740
Until the slumber you fall, I tell you. I don't know if I was too close because I might hold.

10:38:30.980 --> 10:38:37.300
But I need to show her. Seems like you did.

10:38:40.020 --> 10:38:43.860
A little sleepy moment. Thank you so much. Good night.

10:38:50.740 --> 10:38:53.780
I just woke up. Can I put you to sleep again?

10:38:54.100 --> 10:39:03.060
You did great, good girl. You can't catch me off guard. I've already been called good girl.

10:39:03.060 --> 10:39:08.660
Good luck getting me in subspace. I'm in dumb space. When I do hypnosis, I feel very dumb.

10:39:13.700 --> 10:39:18.500
It's early in the morning. We need a bedtime ASMR. Absolutely. I am more than open to that.

10:39:18.580 --> 10:39:26.580
We can absolutely do bedtime ASMR. Am I allowed to go for a tinkle and a cup of tea as my voice is

10:39:26.580 --> 10:39:33.460
croaking like a frog? And then we'll just ramble until the 12 hours? Does that sound like a deal?

10:39:37.060 --> 10:39:38.420
You made my boss fall asleep.

10:39:38.820 --> 10:39:49.700
Super early. Hi, Stronny. Tanner is in... I'm getting a frog.

10:39:54.740 --> 10:40:00.660
Thank you very much for the tiff. I'm glad you liked it. Oh no, my Elden Ring. My stream elements

10:40:00.660 --> 10:40:05.780
is gone. So I can't freaking shoot you. Stream elements. Stream elements are so finicky sometimes.

10:40:09.380 --> 10:40:12.100
Oh, I'm already logged in. Go to my dashboard right now.

10:40:14.180 --> 10:40:19.860
Let's try that again. Shall we? My fraud, my fraud phone call. I can't believe that they're not

10:40:19.860 --> 10:40:25.860
getting any, not getting it from me. Thank you, Beryl, for the tip. I appreciate it. I'm glad.

10:40:27.540 --> 10:40:34.340
For our good dumb, keep it up, mom. Yeah. Right, I'm going to very quickly go make a cup of tea

10:40:34.420 --> 10:40:38.900
and do a quick tinkle. You are... I'm actually going to pin my...

10:40:43.300 --> 10:40:51.460
Rain cloud. Please rest well, rain. Okay. And sleep well. I'm not gonna force you to talk. Okay,

10:40:52.580 --> 10:41:01.620
I'm actually going to pin my... Any questions? Question mark? Did that work? Yeah, it did work.

10:41:01.620 --> 10:41:06.660
I'm going to pin it. So you're welcome to think it, but please rest well, rain. You work so hard.

10:41:07.380 --> 10:41:12.020
And you did fantastic. Hi, Stronny Tenors, Polk. Happy first week. This was my first rain.

10:41:12.660 --> 10:41:19.300
Oh my god, thank you so much. There's so kind of you. Oh my gosh. I'm glad I could take your rate,

10:41:19.300 --> 10:41:22.820
Cherry. Am I allowed to say that? I'm sorry. I'm sorry if I'm not allowed to say that, but I'm

10:41:22.820 --> 10:41:29.940
glad I could take it anyway. Okay, I've pinned that. I'm going to go make a cup of tea. I will be

10:41:29.940 --> 10:41:33.860
roughly three minutes because it takes three minutes for the kettle to boil. It takes three

10:41:33.860 --> 10:41:37.860
minutes for the kettle to boil, yeah? So you're welcome to ask me any questions of any variety.

10:41:39.380 --> 10:41:42.900
But please sleep well, rain cloud. Thank you for the rate. I really appreciate that.

10:41:42.900 --> 10:41:48.820
I need to add you on Discord, actually. I need DM, the whole Umi Plus squad, actually,

10:41:48.820 --> 10:41:54.500
and get everyone on Discord. And then once I have access to you on Discord, the possibility.

10:41:55.460 --> 10:42:04.180
Right, I'll very quickly mute and I'll go and make a cup of tea, okay? Okay, cup of tea time.

10:42:04.180 --> 10:42:10.180
Tea time. Oh wait, I'll do that. I'll close my eyes first. Oh wait, close eyes. I'm not very smart

10:42:10.180 --> 10:42:12.180
whenever I do that. Never mind.

10:49:54.500 --> 10:49:57.620
That time we brushed our teeth and I was like fully ready to go bed.

10:49:59.940 --> 10:50:06.980
Yeah, yeah, remember that time? Yeah, okay. I entered the room with a cup of tea. My tongue's

10:50:06.980 --> 10:50:12.660
sticking out. I was like, yeah, what time? Yeah. I mean, do we need a brush or two

10:50:12.660 --> 10:50:16.180
twice now? I don't know. You're not really supposed to brush it like too much.

10:50:16.980 --> 10:50:26.900
Yeah, I just got caught up. Apparently, shebe's alternative Twitter is over 10K followers,

10:50:26.900 --> 10:50:31.780
so what the heck just happened whilst I was streaming? I don't know what I've missed,

10:50:31.780 --> 10:50:41.300
but congrats girls, oh my gosh. Right, shall we? Shall we get to the bottom of it?

10:50:41.540 --> 10:50:44.260
Oh, she offered feet for 10K.

10:50:46.340 --> 10:50:51.540
Shut up. My toes are out right now. Hold on, I'm putting Goop on my toes right now

10:50:51.540 --> 10:51:01.780
for the money shot and everything. She has lovely feet. True. Yeah, she left the containment zone.

10:51:01.780 --> 10:51:10.020
Oh, okay, she componds, she componds. Right, let me refresh these marshmallows.

10:51:10.020 --> 10:51:12.340
Ooh, I got 20 more questions. Thank you for all the questions.

10:51:17.300 --> 10:51:21.380
Some reason it shows marshmallows from like a week ago at the top. I don't know what that means.

10:51:21.380 --> 10:51:25.460
Does that mean someone's verified is like put it up there on purpose? I don't know how it works.

10:51:28.900 --> 10:51:34.340
My stream disconnected. Why does OBS do that? I said OBS disconnected. I'm still here.

10:51:35.060 --> 10:51:40.980
Stream. You give me a heart attack every time you freaking do that. Please don't do that.

10:51:43.060 --> 10:51:47.940
Oh, I just get notifications that says OBS, you've disconnected. I'm like, please no.

10:51:49.220 --> 10:51:54.820
Please no. I'm trying to make it to the 12 hour mark, please, please. We're only one hour away.

10:51:56.980 --> 10:52:01.540
Someone said, oh yeah, you can request me to say stuff on my accent by the way. Someone says,

10:52:01.540 --> 10:52:12.500
please can you say ravioli in a seductive tone? Ravioli in a seductive, ravioli, ravioli, ravioli.

10:52:14.260 --> 10:52:17.940
That little sleep hypnosis thing you did was amazing. I'm convinced you'd be amazing at a

10:52:17.940 --> 10:52:22.900
meditation type sleep bottle. Yes, I want to do like bedtime hypnosis stuff as well, like completely

10:52:22.900 --> 10:52:27.860
like fine on the table. You haven't even started your hypnosis content yet and you're already

10:52:27.860 --> 10:52:35.780
infiltrating my mind by turning my internal monologue scotch. I can't wait for you to turn my brain

10:52:35.780 --> 10:52:45.540
into your bin, into your female doll. Oh my. Ever since you've debuted, I've gone from a man lost

10:52:45.540 --> 10:52:51.940
in a desert drawing of thirst to one drowning in a flood of nonstop good times. Yes. And all I want

10:52:51.940 --> 10:52:57.060
to do is just close my eyes and let the waves take me. Would you drag me into the depths? I want

10:52:57.060 --> 10:53:04.980
you to. I'm glad you can have good times here. It was, it was dry for a while but I hope, I hope

10:53:04.980 --> 10:53:11.860
it's good times here, good vibes. Yeah. We go swimming together, you know. I playfully dunk

10:53:11.860 --> 10:53:17.780
your head under the water a little bit. Just playfully. And no other reason. No other lower

10:53:17.780 --> 10:53:25.460
related reason. It was awfully cold in the depths but now we're in warmer waters I think you could

10:53:25.460 --> 10:53:33.860
say. Can you run from Prime Minister of Australia? So at least through, if it's bad ideas, it sounds

10:53:33.860 --> 10:53:41.140
nice coming from me but I've not even been granted rights into the country yet. There, there is a

10:53:41.140 --> 10:53:48.580
timeline where I get rejected and I can't, I have to go back to Scotland and I can't run the business.

10:53:48.580 --> 10:53:55.300
Let's hope we're not on that timeline. That would be terrible. Could you imagine if I got kicked out

10:53:55.300 --> 10:54:07.540
of, oh my god. Munga, munga. Uh, hi, Strony. I don't know if it's been answered already. It's okay to

10:54:07.540 --> 10:54:12.340
ask something you're not sure that's been answered. It's not possible for someone to be here all the

10:54:12.340 --> 10:54:16.260
time so please don't ever be afraid to ask a question you think that's already been answered.

10:54:16.900 --> 10:54:23.060
It's not possible for you to be here all the time. I know, I know it's terrible but it's not possible.

10:54:24.020 --> 10:54:28.660
Sorry if you did but I just want to know if you're interested in the game Lost Planet 2. It's on

10:54:28.660 --> 10:54:32.580
Xbox and I think you'd like it. Could easily play the whole thing in one stream. Also, you

10:54:32.580 --> 10:54:39.220
played Elden Ring. Would you be open to playing Armor Core 6? Armor Core 6 has been popping up over,

10:54:40.420 --> 10:54:44.980
I've heard the name a few times now. Love your streams that I can't wait to bounce those hypnotic

10:54:44.980 --> 10:54:54.260
eyes back on you. Stinky. Armor Core 6. I don't know what it is but it keeps coming up.

10:54:55.140 --> 10:55:00.580
Lost Planet 2. I should actually write down game ideas because I trust your guys's like

10:55:01.300 --> 10:55:04.260
suggestions over anything that I could possibly come up with.

10:55:04.980 --> 10:55:12.420
8c6. It's phenomenal. It's great. It's really good. Highly rated game.

10:55:14.260 --> 10:55:22.340
Not my. Every strongy tone has it's synced up. No my default. I feel like my default and I'm

10:55:22.340 --> 10:55:27.460
like that and I'm all monotone. Like you can't even understand. Lost Planet 2 is an OG Xbox game.

10:55:27.460 --> 10:55:32.980
How did I never come across it then? I don't know when it came out. Maybe it was still at

10:55:32.980 --> 10:55:38.500
the stage where like so I used to get attached to one game and when Assassin's Creed Brotherhood

10:55:38.500 --> 10:55:47.940
came out like I hardly got any new games. I got Skyrim, I got Black Ops, AC Brotherhood and the rate

10:55:47.940 --> 10:55:58.740
of like new games like went down astronomically. If it's probes of 2006, 2008 and then Armor Core

10:55:58.900 --> 10:56:03.780
6. I'll definitely, these games keep coming up and I trust your guys's judgment.

10:56:03.780 --> 10:56:06.740
Hi strongy, I was curious if you would follow guys's chat one day.

10:56:08.180 --> 10:56:13.860
Yeah, of course we're doing the jelly bean game. Are you silly? Are you being a silly sausage? Of

10:56:13.860 --> 10:56:19.780
course we're playing the jelly bean game again. How else are you gonna touch me and grab me and

10:56:19.780 --> 10:56:30.500
hold me back? You guys wouldn't stop grabbing me. You all grabbed me. You stinky stinker things.

10:56:31.300 --> 10:56:35.860
Ah my calibration is having a hard time today. Hold on. Let me re-calibrate.

10:56:39.060 --> 10:56:46.100
Hopefully my mouth stops wiggling. Okay it's not wiggling anymore. Jelly bean game.

10:56:47.060 --> 10:56:52.580
We do what? So in the jelly bean game you can like grab opponents and hold them back

10:56:52.580 --> 10:56:59.060
to like stop them from jumping to the objective or whatever and I used to have to beg. I was so

10:56:59.060 --> 10:57:06.580
bad at the game. I would basically have to beg till people would hold back to let me through the

10:57:06.580 --> 10:57:14.100
first level because I ended up losing it so many times that I wasn't playing the game and I respect

10:57:14.100 --> 10:57:21.300
it and you guys play because I was that freaking bad at the game. That is so much fun. So yes you

10:57:21.300 --> 10:57:29.220
will absolutely be playing that again. I will always do like a stream snipe game every month.

10:57:30.180 --> 10:57:36.900
One that's like public and one I do prioritize free to play games. Unfortunately I've started off

10:57:36.900 --> 10:57:42.820
a rune scoop which normally premium is the only way to play it so I've picked a bit pearly.

10:57:43.780 --> 10:57:48.820
I do apologize but I would like to get 99 cooking and it would be fun to kind of like

10:57:48.820 --> 10:57:55.620
achieve goals along the way. So going strong girls. Strony what type of fan are you like the most?

10:57:58.820 --> 10:58:05.380
Any. Like whatever inspires you. Like some people do like a meme funny moment. Like I uploaded a short

10:58:06.100 --> 10:58:12.500
and like in the short I was like and yes before you ask and I went back in the like the bagpipes

10:58:12.500 --> 10:58:18.020
and like the Scottish flag appear behind me and then someone liked it so much they basically made

10:58:18.020 --> 10:58:23.780
a Scottish beam come out of my mouth and like the first panel was me going and then the second

10:58:23.780 --> 10:58:29.220
panel was like I was like throwing this Scottish beam out of my mouth and it reminded me there's a

10:58:29.220 --> 10:58:36.020
trend on how it's the Mika world and she goes Mika no no this time you've been waiting for see

10:58:36.020 --> 10:58:43.060
two one Mika Mika beam and it reminded me of that and it's so good. Like whatever you enjoy

10:58:43.060 --> 10:58:46.580
like if you enjoy meme make a meme if you enjoy the other side of things you're more than welcome

10:58:46.580 --> 10:58:53.860
to make the other side of things because I like that stuff too. And yeah like anything 10 hours

10:58:53.860 --> 10:59:00.660
deep let's go yeah we're gonna make it a 12 hour stream uh so I'm just ranting ranting rambling

10:59:01.220 --> 10:59:06.340

10:59:06.340 --> 10:59:12.340
my nails on it. I'm just waiting for it to cool down before I can sip it. Stroney any chance of

10:59:12.340 --> 10:59:19.540
you making a 2D platform video game in the future that's so specific why are you wanting to bounce

10:59:19.540 --> 10:59:28.020
on me in 2D? I'm I'm not making a video game no. I have plans to make video game in the future

10:59:28.020 --> 10:59:34.900
but that's the future future like now meow. What should a lad do if he makes a fan made album?

10:59:34.900 --> 10:59:41.940
What should uh sorry make a fan made album? What should he send us general or art?

10:59:42.500 --> 10:59:51.780
What does that mean? Fan made album? Album? Like a music or am I being dumb? I'm in it for the

10:59:51.780 --> 10:59:56.580
long haul today I'm here we go I'm oh please don't stay up if it's gonna be bad for your health

11:00:06.660 --> 11:00:08.100
you know Rottos and Mirona

11:00:12.260 --> 11:00:20.580
a rap stuff oh my god can you do a diss track on me? Stroney cuttles more like Stroney can't make

11:00:20.580 --> 11:00:32.420
her mind up. Uttles on her 15th persona. Muttles got tape on her tape the only reason she's a

11:00:32.420 --> 11:00:38.900
VTuber is to give herself boobies because she ain't got any in real life yeah whoo diss tracks

11:00:38.900 --> 11:00:45.380
Stroney diss track no the diss tracks yeah that's right you're getting diss tracks again oh I just

11:00:45.380 --> 11:00:52.740
punched my knuckle against the desk by accident someone says I kneel you are too powerful so much

11:00:52.740 --> 11:01:01.700
kneeling I like it do it again it is humbling to know someone like you exist I've never dumped so

11:01:01.700 --> 11:01:10.820
much ink before within a span of a week and from it so happy from watching you and the girls I

11:01:10.820 --> 11:01:16.340
hope for your success and it's one of the few I feel that is deserved oh thank you so much thank

11:01:16.340 --> 11:01:23.860
you for spilling your ink I do like hearing about ink spilling like why yes maybe I am a V sucky after

11:01:24.020 --> 11:01:35.780
oh maybe there is sucky by blood the pause after hearing where I live it smells like freshly baked

11:01:35.780 --> 11:01:40.180
cookies because I'm near a cookie factory and I'm and I'm already awake for today we're still going

11:01:40.180 --> 11:01:46.260
strong oh that's dangerous for your health it's dangerous to be awake for more than like 16 hours

11:01:46.260 --> 11:01:54.740
I think is when it's bad like your brain function your cognitive function goes down like big big

11:01:57.140 --> 11:02:04.500
I knew it velar is going to be my oval my version of meet the grams will be meet the indulgers

11:02:05.220 --> 11:02:11.380
what did you think about the generation name indulge because if I told you technically if I

11:02:11.380 --> 11:02:18.580
told you a secret this is a secret for only who watch this stream right now um gen one's name

11:02:18.580 --> 11:02:28.900
indulge plays into gen two and three um and if we do get to three gens oh I'm gonna be so excited

11:02:28.900 --> 11:02:38.820
because to reveal the full names because they all play into each other and I'm so excited I wonder

11:02:38.900 --> 11:02:43.220
if anyone could guess I don't I think it's impossible to get there's too many variations like

11:02:44.420 --> 11:02:50.180
someone says is there a chance for a stream of a software game other than Elden Ring I don't think

11:02:50.180 --> 11:02:58.740
I can get any help in the other Elden Rings though however I think she be as interested in Bloodborne

11:03:02.900 --> 11:03:08.100
but unfortunately I'm not very good and the reason I like Elden Ring so much is because you

11:03:08.100 --> 11:03:17.300
guys can come in and help me but I'm not good on my own um three gens worth the tubers I will become

11:03:17.300 --> 11:03:24.340
a husk I'll become a husk honestly maybe we can guess after the second gen

11:03:24.420 --> 11:03:29.940
um

11:03:33.140 --> 11:03:39.700
oh no you can't guess it because there's two secret words that aren't present

11:03:40.580 --> 11:03:48.340
it it forms a sentence basically all three gens perform a sentence that perfectly encapsulates

11:03:48.340 --> 11:03:57.140
won't be where it is indulge marionette and you're like nah yeah you're no the secret words

11:03:57.140 --> 11:04:01.460
makes it impossible just wanted to drop one more marrow I've watched all the velo girls and well

11:04:01.460 --> 11:04:07.780
I like them a lot you're my oh thank you are you sure I'm your oh she though like I'm not gonna say

11:04:07.780 --> 11:04:13.460
anything but like Emmys T's and Oof A.C's accent like I'm not killed and she sounds so

11:04:14.100 --> 11:04:21.140
fucking adorable and her accent I wish I could copy it but I can't why is she irish I see why are

11:04:21.140 --> 11:04:28.740
you irish I don't know I just love the way she sounds but I feel like I'm doing a terrible

11:04:29.300 --> 11:04:34.580
that's terrible you have your own accent power power

11:04:35.380 --> 11:04:44.820
sure well the sentence will look good but what gen no I am not I am absolutely not doing any further

11:04:45.620 --> 11:04:50.100
so there some people were like are you doing a spin-off gen are you doing like a safer work

11:04:50.100 --> 11:04:59.300
variation no I've absolutely no interest I am exhausted I took so much HP damage getting gen

11:04:59.300 --> 11:05:06.660
one out I am very thankful to say that if gen two and three do happen the HP damage is reduced

11:05:06.660 --> 11:05:15.700
significantly because I learned so much I learned so much and when you do the first time you do it

11:05:15.700 --> 11:05:23.860
it's so hard but anytime after it just gets easier but I am I have no interest I feel like absolutely

11:05:23.860 --> 11:05:31.140
no shade or anything to any other VTuber agency if you start throwing gen after gen it is very

11:05:31.140 --> 11:05:38.260
clear you do not give an absolute rats arse about the content for your girls and it's just it's

11:05:38.260 --> 11:05:44.260
such a shame that those girls put faith in you as an agency and your response is throw another gen

11:05:44.260 --> 11:05:51.140
out throw another no absolutely no no very disappointing I don't like that that's just me

11:05:51.700 --> 11:05:57.540
uh you like instantly became my or she I don't have an endurance for long streamers but I really

11:05:57.540 --> 11:06:02.340
enjoy stopping in on stream throughout the day I'm glad I'm glad I can catch you I'll see you

11:06:02.340 --> 11:06:07.620
tomorrow in old school runscape huh huh you might you might not be in the game but I'll be online

11:06:07.620 --> 11:06:20.660
I'll be online okay 55 HP honestly you keep talking with her damage yeah I keep taking damage

11:06:20.740 --> 11:06:28.500
with her with her damage human wave tactic based running strongy are there any ASMR stories based

11:06:28.500 --> 11:06:36.420
on real life um I have rambling ASMR coming out where I'm just kind of talking about stuff that's

11:06:36.420 --> 11:06:48.500
happening now that's me if you mean the small pp audio then uh there's an anon that's very passionate

11:06:48.500 --> 11:06:55.220
about it and he sent me a prompt and well he didn't he didn't actually even mean to make it

11:06:55.220 --> 11:06:59.220
into a script or anything he just sent me a prompt of what he liked and I was like you know what

11:06:59.220 --> 11:07:04.260
you know what I'll make it into something as so your guys are more than welcome to use marshmallows

11:07:04.260 --> 11:07:08.660
to put down your things because it unironically can inspire me to make like an entire script

11:07:09.380 --> 11:07:14.340
um I am happy to take inspiration I'll yonk it I like reading your deep dark fantasy

11:07:14.820 --> 11:07:19.060
I want to hit them with a diss track I know but also I don't want to go into them and be like

11:07:19.060 --> 11:07:25.620
public anime number one in veilerland I talk a lot of hmm but I'm such a little teddy bear

11:07:27.140 --> 11:07:33.140
nah it's all funny I have to admit something I fall asleep to your voice during streams

11:07:33.140 --> 11:07:36.660
only for a little bit like 30 minutes to an hour the volume doesn't matter your voice just knocks

11:07:36.660 --> 11:07:42.340
me out I get so cozy from the yapping that I wake you up through the rage part against

11:07:43.060 --> 11:07:47.860
against the RDA guy in section I'm sorry if I woke you up with my screen

11:07:51.380 --> 11:07:55.460
hey stroney I'm glad to catch some of your lives I've been recovering from

11:07:56.740 --> 11:08:04.340
the unmentionable one and I'm finally feeling better I hope to see many more streams from you and the girls

11:08:04.420 --> 11:08:17.140
someone's signed this with their name sorry I think this might be um

11:08:19.460 --> 11:08:24.260
uh I'm hope you're okay and I'm glad you feel better you're starting to feel more like yourself

11:08:25.060 --> 11:08:28.900

11:08:28.900 --> 11:08:32.580
gonna I'm not gonna think it but you guys are welcome to sign maros but I won't see your name

11:08:32.580 --> 11:08:40.100
if you sign a maro at the bomb okay I'm glad you picked Samwise the brave I am so glad

11:08:41.380 --> 11:08:50.820
you my refling gave me the courage seriously why the refling I don't know maybe it's because he gives

11:08:50.820 --> 11:08:58.420
me courage hi stroney saying this is the Scott so when I say this you know it's not just because

11:08:58.420 --> 11:09:02.900
of the accent I love your voice listen to you up on stream is my favorite part of your stream and

11:09:02.900 --> 11:09:08.100
when you talk gently it gives me tingles I'm really looking forward to the ASMR wait I can give you

11:09:08.100 --> 11:09:14.820
tingles just when I be a bit more gentler in the morning that's interesting normally I like I only

11:09:14.820 --> 11:09:22.500
happen in the the thing the thingy goodbye those who are sleeping I gotta go finish up work have

11:09:22.500 --> 11:09:30.340
good day yeah have a good day thanks for hanging uh like yeah definitely a not safe

11:09:32.660 --> 11:09:39.780
what are you saying read out your own risk but are you gonna do a hmm audio involving oh

11:09:42.580 --> 11:09:48.900
let's call it joystick and we'll take the first three letters are you gonna do hip no joystick

11:09:49.620 --> 11:09:56.740
uh yes it's one of the main things I'm interested in I want to take full control

11:10:00.500 --> 11:10:06.740
the question is can I put you under though I'm I'm a bit unskilled at the under part it's scary to

11:10:06.740 --> 11:10:12.500
put you under because I'm not sure how good I am at it and as well I don't know if the accent is

11:10:12.500 --> 11:10:18.500
actually a debuff on putting you under a spell or the control type section of it so I'm a bit worried

11:10:19.460 --> 11:10:24.900
we'll see what happens as I said I'm learning and you guys have been fantastic and it will be

11:10:24.900 --> 11:10:29.700
like you guys are always fantastic and give me like a lot of space it'll take time to get

11:10:30.580 --> 11:10:37.380

it's over for you you crave the rolling ours you crave the in luck and most of all you crave the

11:17:49.220 --> 11:17:54.580
smell of iron brew on the breath of the woman you've just kissed

11:17:57.700 --> 11:18:02.340
you're you've been scot-pilled and there's no turning back

11:18:04.340 --> 11:18:13.460
the peak I'll say oh should she still go ahead yeah we've got another t-minus 40 minutes uh is

11:18:13.540 --> 11:18:18.340
mercy going to be online in 40 minutes I never thought about that

11:18:21.780 --> 11:18:28.180
already had a taste for the Scottish accent it's uh bettish I'm sure no one

11:18:28.980 --> 11:18:34.820
but found out when I have my scot-pilled oh yeah yeah she's still online okay um before I go offline

11:18:34.820 --> 11:18:40.420

11:18:40.420 --> 11:18:49.460
going to redirect you into one of her songs I'll make you listen to ac's furry cover thing

11:18:50.980 --> 11:18:58.660
xt nestle pouses on your ooh you so warm I love emmy's emmy aces

11:18:58.660 --> 11:19:03.380
frankly the right the reason why I get ac and emmy mixed up all the time is it because they both

11:19:03.380 --> 11:19:08.500
begin with I is because I used to call them the twins in development they were called the twins

11:19:08.580 --> 11:19:13.700
in development I know they're not twins they I just called them twins it just happened okay

11:19:13.700 --> 11:19:18.980
so emmy and ac always get referred to each other by accident now there's few problems with my

11:19:20.980 --> 11:19:29.140
if you had a chance to change your oh I changed forget changing fate I put it into my own hands

11:19:29.700 --> 11:19:37.060
and I am strong it calls the cullfish of the war

11:19:40.820 --> 11:19:45.220
sending them out to say that you and emmy's are my favorites it means incredibly talented

11:19:45.220 --> 11:19:49.780
and entertaining and she's an absolute sucky mom but there's something about you that makes you

11:19:50.580 --> 11:19:56.100
so easy to listen to it's probably because you can tell how low IQ I am so I make you feel safe

11:19:56.900 --> 11:20:04.580
see mersey's a dork so you lure your guard around her but me because I'm brain dead yeah

11:20:04.580 --> 11:20:11.860

warning for stream let's see how far I can read into this before we can

11:20:18.900 --> 11:20:25.060
as you stare into your reeflings eyes to hypnotize them you get a little too close to one and catch

11:20:25.140 --> 11:20:34.260
your reflection in the eye you suddenly feel tired and a desire to bend to their oh good girl

because if no the problem is if I go into subspace I can't talk I literally can't talk

11:21:47.940 --> 11:21:53.220
how am I supposed to entertain if I can't talk if I'm just here squealing like a little

11:21:54.100 --> 11:22:05.140
picky subspace emissary reference subspace emissary reference no subspace is a thinking type

11:22:06.740 --> 11:22:11.860
and it makes it really hard for me to freaking talk through it it's really freaking hard

11:22:13.380 --> 11:22:20.020
no I can't talk and I need to be able to talk you can't just stare at my face while I go

11:22:20.020 --> 11:22:26.900
I'm so happy that I saw you on my Twitter feed oh is that how you found me on Twitter oh maybe

11:22:26.900 --> 11:22:33.140
I should actually start using Twitter then oh but I don't like using Twitter all the girls have

11:22:33.140 --> 11:22:38.260
been so fantastic like I'm streaming in one hour I'm doing this I'm doing that I literally

11:22:38.260 --> 11:22:45.060
have put nothing on Twitter I can't like I've used Twitter to make ASMR

11:22:46.020 --> 11:22:52.340
collabs that's it I can't do it okay please please look at the Twitter please it's so

11:22:56.820 --> 11:23:02.260
can't could stare at your face for an age less you underestimate what you do a karaoke stream

11:23:02.260 --> 11:23:09.300
with the girls I think latency is too much for me with the girls however the girls might be able

11:23:09.300 --> 11:23:15.940
to do it with one another because latency wouldn't be an issue um I have to put your stream schedule

11:23:15.940 --> 11:23:21.060
on my desk to make sure I remember I'm so bad I apologize if people use Twitter for notifications

11:23:21.060 --> 11:23:26.980
I adjust I don't like it I don't like it I actually don't like it I'm sorry well I'm off to work

11:23:26.980 --> 11:23:34.100
good night and don't forget to wash you to brush my teeth yes I won't forget uh if it's been 30

11:23:34.100 --> 11:23:37.940
minutes since I last drank yes it will be okay we'll brush your teeth right before you end

11:23:37.940 --> 11:23:44.180
Twitter recently uh officially allowed the content and it's signal boosting the words

11:23:44.180 --> 11:23:49.700
mentioning oh is it I'm gonna make a certain video then I've been needing to make a video

11:23:49.700 --> 11:23:54.980
as a thank you for ages and I'm stalling I'm scared because maybe I should do it no no

11:23:56.740 --> 11:24:02.420
maybe yeah shimmy shimmy yeah shimmy yeah shimmy y'all

11:24:04.580 --> 11:24:05.940
I wonder what I could be doing

11:24:07.780 --> 11:24:11.460
and I really strongly made me have a good sleep schedule because I wake up early to watch

11:24:13.460 --> 11:24:18.340
I'm glad ah yes the bits get upside down when they go to Australia so it takes places long for

and then ended up rambling so much we got to the 10 hour mark and then I made a cup of tea and it

11:24:41.940 --> 11:24:48.020

11:27:32.260 --> 11:27:40.580

11:27:44.340 --> 11:27:46.420
basically this meme if I can see the image

11:27:53.220 --> 11:27:58.180
this was the meme so it was like chaos behind the scenes setting up for debut

11:27:58.180 --> 11:28:02.820
but like we all came together to discuss how we're like absolutely going to destroy everyone

11:28:02.820 --> 11:28:07.460
unanimously and like do all these like things to like get everyone pent up I'm not even pretending

11:28:07.460 --> 11:28:12.980
otherwise like literally chaos is the top one all of us preparing for debut but when it came to

11:28:12.980 --> 11:28:20.660

creators you would like to collaborate with outside the group sadly I am uh very I don't know what the

11:30:24.900 --> 11:30:36.100
word is if people reach out to me I am more than happy to but I feel like if I reach out then I'm

11:30:37.060 --> 11:30:41.780
bothering so like the yumi plus girls will be nothing but receptive to me I absolutely adore

11:30:41.780 --> 11:30:47.460
them so I'm I'm gonna try and get a collab going with them or something or ASMR or anything like

11:30:47.460 --> 11:30:55.060
that um but like anyone basically the sentence if you f with me I f with you but because like

11:30:56.020 --> 11:31:03.300
all strongies from um veal or like I don't want anyone feeling forced and I'm also quite

11:31:05.620 --> 11:31:10.580
appropriate with certain jokes and I don't want to make anyone uncomfortable during a collab so I

11:31:10.580 --> 11:31:17.300
only I don't know I'm just shy like I really like fen but I would never ask for a collab because I

11:31:17.300 --> 11:31:22.820
just I I know for a fact like I would just make her uncomfortable so I'm just gonna be like thumbs up

11:31:22.820 --> 11:31:36.340

sadly most potential clubs speak English instead of scott oh they'll never understand me well there

11:31:52.580 --> 11:31:59.540
was actually something really funny um was that a zura in debut called me a fish and when we were

11:31:59.540 --> 11:32:05.620
doing the mock I was with the girls like um we were doing the mock so five of us were in the voice

11:32:05.620 --> 11:32:11.380
call and whoever was doing the mock went and did it um and as they were called me a fish and I was

11:32:11.380 --> 11:32:18.260
like a fish in my accent and the girls were like laughing up a storm over it and I was like oh yeah

11:32:18.260 --> 11:32:23.860
I freaking love it here like they're just so amazing and they they just get it but like I feel

11:32:23.860 --> 11:32:28.420
like if I collabed with someone outside of veal or like they're afraid to make fun of my accent I'm

11:32:28.420 --> 11:32:33.300
like no make fun of it are you joking me I say words funny someone was saying like the way I say

11:34:48.820 --> 11:34:53.140

well there always do one new page on them there's four audios per month

11:36:39.860 --> 11:36:45.940
if that's what you mean I really get to watch streams since it starts at 2am for me

11:36:46.740 --> 11:36:55.780
I'm so sorry where are you from you must be you must be paired

11:36:56.260 --> 11:37:03.380
I've found your location I'm now coming to your house I love when people put their

11:37:03.380 --> 11:37:08.660
time zone in the chat and then I get to figure out like roughly where they're from I'm just like

11:37:08.660 --> 11:37:16.500
I'm coming over now it's over for you the girl was streaming when I got home from working to

11:37:16.500 --> 11:37:21.940
still streaming when I went to sleep and I'm about to go back to work I fear you're scared of me

11:37:22.820 --> 11:37:26.340
I work at third shifts the streams are hard to come by oh

11:37:27.460 --> 11:37:33.220
for who are you three chefs that's rough okay and I found four we will be in good

11:37:34.020 --> 11:37:39.860
zeal good yeah yeah zeal good uh sir I don't know how to say sir in German

11:37:41.620 --> 11:37:47.780
museo no that's french starting zero meter from your car at zero meters and getting in

11:37:48.500 --> 11:37:56.020
I'm losing the ep fate on your unit falsely can you last another 20 minutes or is it over

11:37:57.940 --> 11:38:02.260
it's 20 minutes putting the kettle on for you now oh thanks thanks I don't need a wee cup of tea

11:38:02.260 --> 11:38:08.260
when I come in is that a threat or an offer off for real though thanks for streaming them because

11:38:08.260 --> 11:38:14.660
your streams are so long yeah uh streams are completely impossible for vod watchers it's uh

11:38:14.740 --> 11:38:18.100
pretty crazy unless you kind of use my streams as like something to listen in the

11:38:18.100 --> 11:38:23.620
background as you work it's like impossible for vod watchers to uh get up to date

11:38:25.300 --> 11:38:31.300
I always miss streams because of work oh work is so stinky you're telling me capitalism is in

11:38:31.300 --> 11:38:40.420
is the reason why I don't have more ink we will destroy capitalism I want all the ink

11:38:40.500 --> 11:38:47.860
like vod watchers they lose and unfortunately with a streamer like me vod watchers are very rough

11:38:49.060 --> 11:38:56.260
what happens in 20 minutes I go offline we reach the 12 hour stream mark where the vod blows up

11:38:56.260 --> 11:39:05.940
if I go one second after 12 12 hours so I have to go sadly oh I've been drinking cola I can't

11:39:05.940 --> 11:39:15.620
brush my teeth you're not to brush your teeth for 30 minutes because of the enamel sorry we did

11:39:15.620 --> 11:39:23.460
technically brush our teeth today so I didn't do a bad job just a rubbish one if it reaches 12 hours

11:39:23.460 --> 11:39:30.740
weeks but literally the vod just self combusts clips will come in for the wind for these long

11:39:30.740 --> 11:39:35.060
yeah it's if you ever clip a section I get to see it and send it to an editor

11:39:36.420 --> 11:39:42.660
good morning good morning Europe hope you all slept well please don't explode

11:39:43.300 --> 11:39:47.300
there's only one kind of explosion I want from you I should probably go to bed good night good

11:39:47.300 --> 11:39:55.300
night rest well those who need to sleep did you do the rda run oh boy I did and I screamed

11:39:55.300 --> 11:40:01.780
in rage I saw red and I don't remember what I said but hopefully I didn't say hopefully I didn't pass

11:40:01.780 --> 11:40:11.940

11:46:06.100 --> 11:46:12.020
to be shocking her and she's gonna be shocking me I'm so sorry I was just I don't I think I'm

11:46:12.020 --> 11:46:16.980
starting to lose it mildly honestly considering how delirious I normally get at the end of the

11:46:16.980 --> 11:46:22.980
stream that really wasn't that bad considering it was just an accent but if you didn't pick up on any

11:46:22.980 --> 11:46:28.740
of that sin sister and myself have bought shock collars and we were going to play Elden ring

11:46:28.740 --> 11:46:34.580
together and whoever causes us to lose the battle and perish we get to shock each other

11:46:34.820 --> 11:46:42.180
yeah I'm gonna have a heart rate monitor I think she also has a heart rate monitor as well so

11:46:42.180 --> 11:46:47.700
things are gonna get out of hand quick also we're really obnoxious streamers together

11:46:48.420 --> 11:46:56.340
we don't mute to talk to chat or thank chat so if you do want to join in that stream just know

11:46:56.340 --> 11:47:03.060
it's a bit of a sensory overload uh because we honestly don't mind each other um doing their thing

11:47:05.060 --> 11:47:06.340
I mean it's gonna be interesting

11:47:09.940 --> 11:47:13.140
Strani I know two tubers who possibly mentioned collabing

11:47:16.660 --> 11:47:19.620

11:47:31.860 --> 11:47:37.700

2 a.m. start streaming at 4 a.m. it's almost 4 p.m. now so I've been awake for 14 hours so my body

11:48:40.500 --> 11:48:49.140
starts to shut down now this is when you're getting cognitive the irony that I start out on that word

11:48:49.140 --> 11:48:55.460
this is when your cognitive function slows down after the 14 hour mark I take a sip of water

11:48:55.460 --> 11:48:57.140
please hydrate if you have water with you

11:49:00.980 --> 11:49:06.580
