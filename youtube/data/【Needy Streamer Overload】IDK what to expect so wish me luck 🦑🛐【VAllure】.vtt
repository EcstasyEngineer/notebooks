WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:01.080
I'm trying my ankle.

00:02.880 --> 00:04.220
Wah.

00:04.220 --> 00:05.120
Wah.

00:05.120 --> 00:05.960
It's up.

00:07.360 --> 00:08.280
It's up.

00:08.280 --> 00:09.360
I think it's up.

00:10.760 --> 00:15.280
I've just built this freaking game and the music.

00:15.280 --> 00:16.360
Oh my gosh.

00:22.920 --> 00:24.280
Are you there?

00:24.280 --> 00:25.360
Hopefully I'm live.

00:26.480 --> 00:29.400
I know I've started like nine minutes early,

00:29.440 --> 00:31.880
but I'm just sitting here and I'm like,

00:31.880 --> 00:34.080
I don't want to wait the nine minutes

00:34.080 --> 00:37.000
for when I'm supposed to start my stream time.

00:37.000 --> 00:39.080
I just want to start now.

00:39.080 --> 00:40.120
So I'm starting now.

00:41.360 --> 00:43.720
I just need to make sure I can see I'm live

00:43.720 --> 00:46.160
and then I can close my stream.

00:46.160 --> 00:48.520
Okay, yeah, it says I'm live.

00:48.520 --> 00:50.280
I'm so sorry I've been boozled.

00:50.280 --> 00:51.800
Yes, I put in the wrong day.

00:51.800 --> 00:53.400
I put in the wrong hour.

00:54.800 --> 00:56.480
Shocking behavior.

00:59.760 --> 01:04.760
I have the most kind of like saddest start

01:05.600 --> 01:07.440
to a stream so far.

01:08.840 --> 01:12.640
I got on Marshmallow, but sadly due to text,

01:12.640 --> 01:16.400
I cannot see what the tone is behind

01:16.400 --> 01:20.880
and I've read the Marshmallow as like a veiled threat

01:20.880 --> 01:24.240
or something, but I just want to say

01:24.240 --> 01:27.720
to the person who sent me a cat picture link,

01:27.720 --> 01:29.680
like an actual picture of a cat.

01:30.920 --> 01:33.080
I don't know how to break this to you.

01:33.080 --> 01:38.080
I got my payloads in March after a very rough time

01:38.240 --> 01:40.920
where I realized that life was too short.

01:40.920 --> 01:45.280
I've not owned a pet, okay, since then

01:45.280 --> 01:48.360
and my payloads came into my life in March.

01:48.360 --> 01:51.760
So please, like, I don't know if it was like

01:51.760 --> 01:53.640
a weird threat thing going on

01:53.640 --> 01:55.480
and I know for literally everyone else,

01:55.520 --> 01:58.160
this makes no sense.

01:58.160 --> 02:00.800
But I can't read tone in a text

02:00.800 --> 02:02.960
and it looked like a weird veiled threat

02:02.960 --> 02:07.960
and I just like, I got my payloads in March.

02:08.400 --> 02:11.920
And yeah, I don't know what to tell you.

02:11.920 --> 02:16.200
Like I've visited America as a child at nine years old.

02:16.200 --> 02:17.920
I don't live in America.

02:17.920 --> 02:20.280
I don't know what's going on.

02:20.280 --> 02:23.600
So you identified yourself as not a reefling.

02:23.600 --> 02:26.200
So if it's all good, I'm just gonna, you know,

02:26.200 --> 02:30.120
stream here with my reeflings and we're gonna do our thing.

02:31.440 --> 02:33.960
Hopefully it wasn't actually a threat,

02:33.960 --> 02:37.920
but if it was, then hey-ho, I've addressed it

02:37.920 --> 02:42.920
and I've negated what your evidence was purely

02:43.120 --> 02:47.280
on the basis that I got Gimli and Vigo in March

02:47.280 --> 02:50.760
and that's when I got my payloads.

02:50.760 --> 02:52.560
So yeah, I apologize for that

02:52.600 --> 02:55.400
making absolutely no sense to literally everyone else,

02:55.400 --> 02:58.640
but good morning, good evening, and good afternoon.

02:58.640 --> 03:00.280
It is a wild ride.

03:00.280 --> 03:02.800
You play two games of Assassin's Creed Brotherhood.

03:02.800 --> 03:06.440
I'm literally not even on my third game stream.

03:06.440 --> 03:09.280
I've never done a second game stream variation.

03:09.280 --> 03:12.160
And it's like, oh, I don't think it's a threat,

03:12.160 --> 03:13.840
but at the same time, my brain's telling me

03:13.840 --> 03:16.560
it's a veiled threat, so I'm just gonna address it that way.

03:16.560 --> 03:19.960
If you didn't mean it, sure, but as I said,

03:19.960 --> 03:22.360
I don't live in America.

03:22.360 --> 03:26.320
I have two cats that I got in March.

03:26.320 --> 03:30.120
They were adopted and yeah, I don't know what else

03:30.120 --> 03:31.960
to tell you, bro.

03:31.960 --> 03:34.720
I'd just appreciate if you left me alone

03:34.720 --> 03:38.360
and I'll just be having fun with my reeflings.

03:38.360 --> 03:39.840
So thanks.

03:39.840 --> 03:40.840
Don't do that again.

03:44.200 --> 03:48.520
Yes, anyway, now that we've got that part over, Jesus.

03:49.280 --> 03:50.720
A little bit of a restless sleep.

03:50.720 --> 03:52.280
May or may not have had diarrhea

03:52.280 --> 03:54.160
because I can't tell context.

03:54.160 --> 03:59.160
However, we're gonna be playing a game

03:59.360 --> 04:03.000
called Needy Streamer Overload.

04:03.000 --> 04:08.000
I just opened it up and it gave me a kind of Windows XP thing.

04:08.920 --> 04:11.400
Windows Vista was like before me.

04:11.400 --> 04:13.760
I'm like, oh, 99% sure.

04:13.760 --> 04:15.760
Wait, Windows Vista.

04:16.600 --> 04:21.600
Like, I don't think I even had, like, wait, when, when,

04:21.680 --> 04:25.080
wait, this is Windows Vista, no, I think Windows Vista

04:25.080 --> 04:27.240
when released it.

04:30.520 --> 04:33.760
Oh, would my dad have had that on the console?

04:33.760 --> 04:38.760
Well, let's give it a Windows Vista or Windows 98.

04:39.240 --> 04:41.440
I don't know what version of Windows, okay?

04:43.360 --> 04:45.400
So we're gonna have a shot at this game.

04:45.400 --> 04:47.200
I don't know what to expect.

04:47.200 --> 04:51.280
Now, a few reflings told me yesterday that for a factoid,

04:51.280 --> 04:55.280
this game apparently has over 500 different endings

04:55.280 --> 04:56.840
or I made that number up

04:56.840 --> 04:59.480
because someone said the game had a ton of endings.

04:59.480 --> 05:02.240
Now, this is gonna be a shorter stream today,

05:02.240 --> 05:05.760
but the good news with it being a shorter stream

05:05.760 --> 05:10.760
is I might be able to release my first ASMR,

05:10.760 --> 05:14.200
like 1K thank you audio, like today,

05:14.200 --> 05:16.520
but I need to go edit it, but it's gonna be, like, fun

05:16.520 --> 05:19.360
and it's clean, it's, like, clean ASMR.

05:20.360 --> 05:22.280
Like, it's literally me just rambling

05:22.280 --> 05:23.720
and, like, tapping away on stuff

05:23.720 --> 05:25.680
and all that kind of thing, so it's cute.

05:25.680 --> 05:28.600
Oh, just, yeah, just a short nine hour stream today.

05:28.600 --> 05:30.960
I'm sure you can strap in the lads and lasses,

05:30.960 --> 05:32.680
don't you worry.

05:32.680 --> 05:36.080
Yeah, only seven are, yeah, easy peasy lemme squeeze there.

05:37.200 --> 05:39.600
I was actually thinking Skyrim,

05:39.600 --> 05:42.680
I've put down Skyrim as two, 12 back to back.

05:43.680 --> 05:48.120
I don't know if I should purposely wake up

05:48.120 --> 05:50.520
right before stream for the Skyrim

05:50.520 --> 05:52.120
and then make a second room

05:52.120 --> 05:54.280
and then we'll do, like, 12 hours

05:54.280 --> 05:57.600
and then in the second room another four hours

05:57.600 --> 06:00.560
and then I think the following day, that 12 hour stream,

06:00.560 --> 06:03.000
I can complete the full achievements.

06:03.840 --> 06:06.920
I'm not 100% sure.

06:06.920 --> 06:08.640
I do have a honey tea with me, though,

06:08.640 --> 06:11.320
so hopefully you have some water, some snackies.

06:12.880 --> 06:14.560
And all that jazz.

06:14.560 --> 06:17.160
But, yes, next week our endurance stream

06:17.160 --> 06:20.160
is going to be Skyrim

06:24.160 --> 06:26.960
and we're also doing an endurance runescape,

06:26.960 --> 06:28.160
old school runescape.

06:28.160 --> 06:30.640
I will tell you what world to be in.

06:30.640 --> 06:33.600
I am going to start on a fresh account.

06:33.600 --> 06:36.720
I am going to buy premium in runescape

06:36.720 --> 06:39.920
but we'll get to that when we get to that, you know what I mean?

06:40.280 --> 06:42.360
So let's stream into it.

06:42.360 --> 06:45.600
Yeah, I'm a bit of a fiend for streaming.

06:45.600 --> 06:47.480
I really enjoy it.

06:47.480 --> 06:50.280
Like, some people, like, due to their circumstances,

06:50.280 --> 06:51.720
like, they can't stream every day

06:51.720 --> 06:53.520
or they find it a bit harder,

06:53.520 --> 06:55.320
like, and mentally it takes its toll.

06:55.320 --> 06:56.160
Me?

06:57.680 --> 07:00.400
Like, I'm about to freaking try out this crazy game

07:00.400 --> 07:01.440
for the first time.

07:01.440 --> 07:02.800
I don't know much about it.

07:02.800 --> 07:06.560
Apparently you can do implied scenes in it,

07:06.560 --> 07:09.840
so I'm like, all right, all right, here we go, here we go.

07:10.720 --> 07:11.920
So I'm interested.

07:13.480 --> 07:14.920
I don't know if it should just get straight into it.

07:14.920 --> 07:16.920
You guys can hear it, it's not too loud.

07:18.280 --> 07:20.120
I was worried about the music being too loud.

07:20.120 --> 07:23.000
I can almost turn it off on my end, but yeah.

07:23.000 --> 07:26.520
Yeah, some streamers, like, kinda just do it circumstances

07:26.520 --> 07:28.280
but I just seem to have the perfect mesh

07:28.280 --> 07:29.920
of, like, missing brain cells here,

07:29.920 --> 07:31.680
a bit of a smooth brain here,

07:31.680 --> 07:33.520
a bit more of a complex surface area

07:33.520 --> 07:34.920
at the section of my brain.

07:34.920 --> 07:36.360
Music's actually a bit quiet, right?

07:36.360 --> 07:38.240
Okay, it's just loud in my headset.

07:39.160 --> 07:40.160
Okay.

07:40.160 --> 07:41.760
I've turned off a bit.

07:41.760 --> 07:45.520
I'm a wee bit close to my mic, but, right.

07:45.520 --> 07:47.840
Oh, it's got a little love heart.

07:47.840 --> 07:52.640
See that, so Mersey was theorized that her heart,

07:52.640 --> 07:55.520
right, this is what I theorized when Mersey thingied.

07:55.520 --> 07:58.600
Mersey's pupils are normal

07:58.600 --> 08:03.400
before her first experience as a yandere occurred

08:03.400 --> 08:05.720
and then her pupils broke

08:05.720 --> 08:08.400
and she can no longer love appropriately.

08:08.400 --> 08:10.600
Like, the concept doesn't exist for her.

08:10.600 --> 08:12.920
If you look back in Amy's lore video,

08:12.920 --> 08:15.080
you'll notice she, her pupils are normal

08:15.080 --> 08:17.240
until she picks up that book.

08:18.240 --> 08:19.400
They have little small details.

08:19.400 --> 08:20.840
Obviously my pupils have always been

08:20.840 --> 08:22.160
a little cuddle fishes.

08:24.280 --> 08:25.120
She's broken.

08:26.520 --> 08:28.480
I started to think that if someone is a beacher

08:28.480 --> 08:30.240
within the entire brain, it's just soup.

08:30.240 --> 08:35.120
Honestly, I would happily join the study data group thing.

08:35.120 --> 08:38.800
You can hook me up because I can prove that I'm pretty dumb.

08:39.880 --> 08:40.720
Like, yeah.

08:42.120 --> 08:43.320
I didn't think to pay attention.

08:43.320 --> 08:45.400
No, there's like little small details

08:45.400 --> 08:46.720
like in everyone's lore.

08:46.720 --> 08:48.680
Like, you know,

08:48.680 --> 08:53.680
AC has scars from the polar bear that she destroyed

08:54.760 --> 08:56.560
and then she raised Feral

08:56.560 --> 08:59.720
and like kind of like all kind of plays back into it.

08:59.720 --> 09:03.960
Like for AC's audio work, she's actually,

09:03.960 --> 09:06.640
hey, this is gonna sound terrible.

09:06.640 --> 09:07.560
I'm so sorry.

09:07.560 --> 09:09.640
This is gonna sound terrible.

09:09.640 --> 09:14.640
In my experience, if there is ever an audio produced

09:15.240 --> 09:20.240
where you the listener may or may not be taking,

09:20.400 --> 09:24.600
have been taken by the band page of,

09:24.600 --> 09:29.600
by the female performer, it always goes down really well.

09:30.040 --> 09:33.560
And I consented AC with the idea

09:33.560 --> 09:36.440
that she doesn't know what Bincent is.

09:36.440 --> 09:37.760
She doesn't know what Bincent is.

09:37.760 --> 09:39.920
So she just jumps on you basically.

09:40.840 --> 09:43.920
No prior warning because she was raised Feral.

09:43.920 --> 09:44.760
So it's not a thing.

09:44.760 --> 09:48.400
Like if you're a bear, you grab what you want instantly.

09:48.400 --> 09:49.240
You wanna eat?

09:49.240 --> 09:50.440
Okay, let's go down to the river.

09:50.440 --> 09:51.440
You wanna climb this tree?

09:51.440 --> 09:52.720
Heck yeah, let's climb this tree.

09:52.720 --> 09:56.840
So yeah, and I kind of made her like that.

09:56.840 --> 09:58.840
I've not made her do anything like that,

09:58.880 --> 10:01.880
but it's just kind of like a small detail

10:01.880 --> 10:02.920
because everyone's like,

10:02.920 --> 10:04.720
oh, this brat needs correction,

10:04.720 --> 10:07.400
or like, oh, G-San, you can't keep up.

10:07.400 --> 10:11.120
And it's kind of interesting to see that dynamic form

10:11.120 --> 10:13.800
because the dynamic in my head was like,

10:13.800 --> 10:18.800
she completely has you wrapped around her claw type thing

10:19.120 --> 10:23.480
and she does what she wants to do, which is so terrible.

10:24.320 --> 10:29.040
But look, this is a fun thing about like going from concept

10:29.040 --> 10:30.400
to actually what's happening now.

10:30.400 --> 10:35.400
Like as I said, girls, I've full control type thing going on.

10:37.640 --> 10:40.160
My update for YouTube monetization,

10:40.160 --> 10:43.920
my statistics have updated and we've been told,

10:43.920 --> 10:47.640
like I can see on my YouTube that I've met the watch hour,

10:47.640 --> 10:50.120
but if I go to apply for monetization,

10:50.120 --> 10:52.560
it says I've only got 88 hours watch time

10:52.560 --> 10:56.760
and I'm like, right, it's been four days.

10:56.760 --> 10:58.600
I would like to apply for it now.

10:58.600 --> 11:00.120
Like I don't have no idea why it's taken

11:00.120 --> 11:02.000
so long to update, it's crazy.

11:05.040 --> 11:06.920
I'm going to take a sipping tin of my tea

11:06.920 --> 11:08.920
and then we'll see what this game provides.

11:10.960 --> 11:14.600
So I am warning you, it is a shorter stream today.

11:14.600 --> 11:19.120
However, I do think Shibi is coming on in two hours.

11:19.120 --> 11:21.120
I think AC is having a rest day.

11:21.120 --> 11:25.320
Shibi and me, is it a rest day for Azura?

11:25.320 --> 11:27.960
I think Azura does double back rest days.

11:27.960 --> 11:28.800
What kind of tea?

11:28.800 --> 11:30.040
It's always the same tea.

11:31.840 --> 11:34.080
But Ash, like I think it's called black tea

11:34.080 --> 11:37.840
or English breakfast tea, either variation with honey.

11:40.600 --> 11:43.960
For once having a tough time sleeping is a good thing.

11:43.960 --> 11:45.640
No, Azura is an ASMR.

11:45.640 --> 11:47.880
Oh my gosh, she's an ASMR today.

11:47.880 --> 11:51.280
Oh, I'm so excited for Azura's ASMR.

11:51.280 --> 11:54.560
Please give her lots of tips unironically.

11:54.560 --> 11:56.880
Oh well, in three ways.

11:56.880 --> 12:01.680
Monetary, your advice, and the other.

12:03.520 --> 12:06.280
She's so nervous, but I know she's going to do perfect.

12:06.280 --> 12:08.480
Like imagine listening, I can hear it now.

12:08.480 --> 12:12.920
Imagine that voice going from ear to ear and her kisses.

12:12.920 --> 12:14.760
Oh, and I hope she hugs me.

12:14.760 --> 12:16.520
I need to, I've not told her to,

12:16.520 --> 12:18.000
like I don't tell anyone what to do,

12:18.000 --> 12:21.600
but if she hugs the mic, heart beat, Azura, heart beat.

12:22.600 --> 12:24.880
Heartbeat and kisses ASMR from Azura.

12:24.880 --> 12:28.360
Yeah, I'm there, I'm already on cloud nine,

12:28.360 --> 12:30.520
I don't know what to tell you.

12:30.520 --> 12:32.520
I don't know what to tell you.

12:32.520 --> 12:37.400
Also, I may have infected Azura and Shibi.

12:37.400 --> 12:39.920
They said they might play Assassin's Creed Brotherhood

12:39.920 --> 12:41.880
at a later time, because I've inspired them

12:41.880 --> 12:44.080
and they've read my mind about playing the games.

12:44.080 --> 12:47.680
I'm going to be fangirling so hard

12:47.680 --> 12:49.880
if I get to watch them play Brotherhood.

12:51.760 --> 12:54.600
But good morning, good evening, good afternoon,

12:54.600 --> 12:57.240
or good time zone, like that one we fling said.

12:58.080 --> 13:00.960
No better feeling than chilling your childhood game.

13:00.960 --> 13:03.120
Bro, literally, I feel like I didn't know

13:03.120 --> 13:04.800
Azura played that game,

13:04.800 --> 13:09.800
because she spoke a lot of like watching anime in her 2.0.

13:10.200 --> 13:13.400
So I was like, oh okay, like on a scale of gamer to weave,

13:13.400 --> 13:17.040
I'd say she was weave type thing, and yeah.

13:17.040 --> 13:20.000
We aren't real we flings, YouTube is telling on us.

13:22.000 --> 13:24.240
Evening, let's spread the AC love.

13:24.240 --> 13:26.320
Oh yeah, spreads my AC all over your face.

13:27.920 --> 13:29.680
So Johnny, you've made me want to re-play Ezio.

13:29.680 --> 13:31.480
Oh, it's so good, oh.

13:31.480 --> 13:34.600
We are going to revisit in Octogre,

13:34.600 --> 13:36.640
but my morning has been good,

13:36.640 --> 13:39.040
my pants have been shat successfully.

13:39.040 --> 13:44.040
Oh, I never got Marshmallow from a fart in the toilet, Anon.

13:45.120 --> 13:46.320
I don't think he's here anymore,

13:46.320 --> 13:50.440
I think we lost him in the great cryo chamber, unfortunately.

13:53.400 --> 13:56.720
But literally, I think Amy started her stream yesterday,

13:56.720 --> 13:58.680
and she was like, I shoulda dida dida dida,

13:58.680 --> 14:00.480
and I shoulda dida dida this morning,

14:00.480 --> 14:02.320
because I got a really weird Marshmallow,

14:02.320 --> 14:04.560
and I'm like, I don't want to freaking upset

14:04.560 --> 14:07.400
or offend anyone or anything like that.

14:07.400 --> 14:09.200
And I'm like, I can't read context,

14:09.200 --> 14:11.680
so my brain's like, is someone threatening me?

14:11.680 --> 14:13.040
Ah, I don't know.

14:13.040 --> 14:14.960
But yeah, bizarre, bizarre.

14:17.640 --> 14:19.560
Rip to every one, pants shitted.

14:19.560 --> 14:20.880
Honestly, it was fucking weak again,

14:20.880 --> 14:24.360
I'm not being funny, but it was absolutely,

14:24.360 --> 14:25.200
you know what, you know what,

14:25.200 --> 14:27.880
it's a British word that I don't use often at all,

14:27.880 --> 14:30.200
but I saw it in a TikTok recently.

14:30.200 --> 14:34.880
That's Pongin, like P-O-N-G-E-D,

14:35.600 --> 14:39.400
Pongin, Pongin, Pong, so smells.

14:39.400 --> 14:41.160
It's such a bizarre word.

14:41.160 --> 14:42.920
I don't say that, I'm just like, I just,

14:42.920 --> 14:46.280
that's Rikin, we say Rikin, R-E-E-K-I-N-G.

14:47.760 --> 14:51.040
Rikin, Pongin, oh, honestly, that sounds Dutch.

14:51.040 --> 14:55.160
Pongin, junga, alo, yay, mooroo.

14:56.360 --> 14:57.920
Mengen, oh yeah, Mengen, Rikin.

14:57.920 --> 14:59.680
I say Rikin for smell, I think Mengen's like,

14:59.680 --> 15:01.720
more disgust, but Rikin is for smell.

15:02.080 --> 15:06.200
And British, you've never heard that, Pongin,

15:06.200 --> 15:09.320
like when it Pongs, I wonder if it's an older word.

15:11.480 --> 15:16.400
My gran, my gran, I think she said, oh, that's Pongin.

15:16.400 --> 15:18.480
Although she made me laugh one time,

15:19.600 --> 15:23.480
she calls farts Windy Pops, and I was like,

15:23.480 --> 15:25.720
and I burst out laughing, I've never heard of any

15:25.720 --> 15:28.120
like refer to as Windy Pops before,

15:28.120 --> 15:29.840
and I'm like, oh, okay.

15:30.760 --> 15:33.080
I was like, it's so polite and so British,

15:33.080 --> 15:35.640
like if we end up getting a British fridge in too,

15:35.640 --> 15:38.120
I'm making her say like, ooh, Windy Pops,

15:38.120 --> 15:40.440
like in our wee English accent.

15:40.440 --> 15:42.320
I was saying that we could get a Welsh,

15:42.320 --> 15:46.720
or a Northern Irish, Irish, but sometimes Northern Irish

15:46.720 --> 15:48.760
don't really wanna be referred to as British, you know,

15:48.760 --> 15:50.640
and in which I completely respect and understand,

15:50.640 --> 15:53.680
like let's not get into it, wait until you learn,

15:53.680 --> 15:55.600
wait until we do the history stream

15:55.600 --> 15:59.560
of why the Irish famine, potato famine,

15:59.560 --> 16:04.560
wasn't actually real, thanks to the British Empire, yahoo.

16:06.360 --> 16:09.560
It's ridiculous, but yes, if you didn't know,

16:09.560 --> 16:12.240
a lot of Irish migrated to America,

16:12.240 --> 16:14.160
a lot of Irish migrated to Scotland,

16:14.160 --> 16:17.320
to different parts, to in search of working food,

16:18.880 --> 16:21.680
which is why a lot of you are like,

16:21.680 --> 16:24.520
I'm one eighth Scottish, I'm one eighth Irish type thing.

16:24.560 --> 16:26.080
Heck yeah you are,

16:26.080 --> 16:29.760
because that's how mass migration works,

16:29.760 --> 16:33.120
so you know that one eighth Scottish in you,

16:33.120 --> 16:35.080
that's right, I'm in you right now,

16:35.080 --> 16:40.080
I'm in your blood supply, I'm beating around there,

16:40.320 --> 16:43.920
I'm seeking things in your body,

16:43.920 --> 16:45.920
because you're like one sixteenth Scots.

16:49.160 --> 16:51.360
As a British person, a lot of things were up for.

16:51.360 --> 16:56.360
Well England, with its sanctions on Scotland.

17:01.200 --> 17:04.040
Please don't take the strunnies in me, oh yeah.

17:05.200 --> 17:06.960
I thought it was meant to be the other way around,

17:06.960 --> 17:09.280
look it works both ways here, that's all I'm saying,

17:09.280 --> 17:13.400
look some people didn't like it, I respect that, okay?

17:13.400 --> 17:17.760
All I'm saying, if I had some sort of sensory organ,

17:17.760 --> 17:20.400
it would give me more of a reason to explore even more.

17:22.360 --> 17:25.720
One fourth Scottish, let's move, actually.

17:26.800 --> 17:29.800
What percent campfire will we tolerate?

17:29.800 --> 17:31.280
I see the most common.

17:33.920 --> 17:37.640
I have three percent strunnie in me, there we go.

17:39.440 --> 17:41.640
The potato famine was not fun for Ireland.

17:41.640 --> 17:44.840
Well wait until you learn even more about the issues.

17:47.680 --> 17:50.240
Maybe we can do an education stream about it,

17:50.280 --> 17:52.080
but I don't want it to be like hate,

17:52.080 --> 17:56.080
because I assure you any English twat the day

17:57.080 --> 18:01.280
did not have any bearing on the famine, many a minute ago.

18:01.280 --> 18:04.000
But I don't mind doing historical education streams,

18:04.000 --> 18:06.720
and the reason why Ireland kentatized them with Scotland

18:06.720 --> 18:09.840
is because there was mass migration due to that,

18:09.840 --> 18:12.720
so I don't mind a cheeky education stream once in a while.

18:12.720 --> 18:16.480
I've actually really always enjoyed academics,

18:16.480 --> 18:18.800
sadly the social sides of academics,

18:18.800 --> 18:22.480
I may have failed that part, but I've always enjoyed it.

18:22.480 --> 18:27.480
I'm actually going back to college soon,

18:27.800 --> 18:30.040
which I'm excited to talk about.

18:30.040 --> 18:32.800
Not now though, man's trying to run a business,

18:32.800 --> 18:34.640
you know what I'm saying?

18:34.640 --> 18:36.560
Well, I say that, I'm actually passing off it,

18:36.560 --> 18:38.600
so it's everyone else's problem, but man.

18:40.840 --> 18:45.840
But I am thinking of doing beauty school,

18:46.000 --> 18:49.600
beauty school, but listen, hear me out,

18:49.600 --> 18:53.000
beauty school dropout, that's a grease thing.

18:53.000 --> 18:55.760
The reason why I'm doing beauty school

18:55.760 --> 18:58.400
is because I want to get a certificate

18:58.400 --> 19:03.400
to possibly open up a little, so you might not know this,

19:05.200 --> 19:07.800
you know in salons, they have a spare room,

19:07.800 --> 19:11.280
these rooms can be rented out for whatever you want,

19:11.280 --> 19:14.280
and I was just thinking on the idea,

19:14.400 --> 19:18.080
when time progresses, things do their thing,

19:18.080 --> 19:20.960
I might have a pop up at a little ASMR shop,

19:20.960 --> 19:22.960
but it's just a little bed in the room,

19:22.960 --> 19:25.120
and it would just be so fun, and I love it,

19:25.120 --> 19:27.600
because I am genuinely passionate about ASMR.

19:27.600 --> 19:29.480
I love the stuff about it,

19:29.480 --> 19:31.400
I've tried to research some of the psychology,

19:31.400 --> 19:32.800
I've came up with my own theories,

19:32.800 --> 19:34.280
not everyone agrees with my theories,

19:34.280 --> 19:36.840
but that's because it's just what it is,

19:36.840 --> 19:38.440
but I think it would be a lot better.

19:38.440 --> 19:42.360
V sucky salon, right, you're done, you're done, you're done.

19:42.920 --> 19:45.520
Honestly, the skills you've learned

19:45.520 --> 19:47.600
running a business is worth a lot,

19:47.600 --> 19:49.280
much more than the MBA.

19:51.880 --> 19:53.880
Well, you see skills, but literally,

19:53.880 --> 19:56.200
I'm at the process where I'm about to hand

19:56.200 --> 19:59.560
everything off now, like I'm so freaking happy,

20:00.640 --> 20:02.840
and the only thing I need to worry about is clippers,

20:02.840 --> 20:06.360
and there's the possibility, for those of you

20:06.360 --> 20:11.360
who have an oh-she-desk and editing skills of the girls,

20:12.840 --> 20:16.600
I am 100% open, like once things settle,

20:16.600 --> 20:19.040
because I know it takes a while to kind of settle

20:19.040 --> 20:20.280
on an oh-she-desk and be like, oh yeah, shit,

20:20.280 --> 20:22.240
yeah, I'm gonna watch her consistently.

20:22.240 --> 20:25.280
If you have the time, and if you're an editor,

20:25.280 --> 20:29.680
I am very open, if you wanted to be a dedicated clipper

20:29.680 --> 20:32.520
or highlight editor for that girl,

20:32.520 --> 20:35.480
you're welcome to email the website.

20:35.480 --> 20:37.520
Just to tell you right now, no,

20:37.520 --> 20:40.320
you do not get a open communication with a girl,

20:41.240 --> 20:44.400
everything is done through IWL messages,

20:44.400 --> 20:46.480
but yeah, if you really enjoy one of the girls

20:46.480 --> 20:49.160
and you wanna clip them, or do highlight streams,

20:49.160 --> 20:52.560
or funny moments type thing, and wanna get paid for it,

20:52.560 --> 20:55.680
hit the website up, because it saves me even more time,

20:55.680 --> 20:59.800
because right now I'm, today after the short stream,

20:59.800 --> 21:02.640
I'm going to edit my 1K, thank you ASMR,

21:02.640 --> 21:05.920
and then upload that, and then I'm gonna send away

21:05.920 --> 21:09.280
a few more clips for editing, because the second guy

21:09.320 --> 21:12.160
we've got, poor guy, I've left him on red

21:12.160 --> 21:16.600
for like six days now, and I'm like, oops, but yeah.

21:16.600 --> 21:19.040
I'm definitely gonna have to find a few more clippers,

21:19.040 --> 21:22.120
I probably wanna try two more clippers, but yeah.

21:22.120 --> 21:25.240
You don't like Vsucky, so you'd say that Vsucky blows,

21:25.240 --> 21:27.400
honestly, shawty, shawty.

21:27.400 --> 21:28.960
But yes, there's opportunities,

21:28.960 --> 21:32.600
please don't think that this is a super closed off thing,

21:32.600 --> 21:34.960
I'm happy to tell you about what the process is like

21:34.960 --> 21:38.280
when it comes to clips, the reason why

21:38.320 --> 21:40.600
subtitles kinda jump at you in clips,

21:40.600 --> 21:43.000
is because that's what gets the monkey side of your brain

21:43.000 --> 21:44.800
to like keep watching.

21:44.800 --> 21:47.720
The editor for Mercy's recent clip,

21:47.720 --> 21:50.240
I forgot to put credit in the blonde one,

21:50.240 --> 21:52.920
you can edit credit in the description.

21:52.920 --> 21:53.760
Right, I need to do that,

21:53.760 --> 21:57.160
Mercy has a new short coming out,

21:57.160 --> 21:58.880
and the editing style is just,

22:00.440 --> 22:02.720
captures the ADHD perfectly,

22:02.720 --> 22:06.320
it has insider knowledge about VTubers,

22:06.320 --> 22:08.200
like I'm just really happy with it,

22:08.200 --> 22:13.200
so if you can edit what Mercy's recently published clips

22:13.680 --> 22:16.040
are like, feel free to hit the website up,

22:16.040 --> 22:18.400
I'm needing a few more clippers.

22:18.400 --> 22:19.720
I'm needing to get,

22:21.320 --> 22:25.560
Sheeby needs clips very badly, I need to put up.

22:25.560 --> 22:26.640
However,

22:28.600 --> 22:30.800
there's like so many little notes I'm like,

22:30.800 --> 22:33.320
so I've told the girls to cover up your

22:34.360 --> 22:36.040
for now, like as you can see,

22:36.040 --> 22:39.840
you can only see my deckliotage at the moment,

22:39.840 --> 22:41.880
because I'm a bit worried about

22:41.880 --> 22:44.120
what the heck's going on with YouTube right now.

22:44.120 --> 22:46.200
I feel like there's still policy updates going,

22:46.200 --> 22:47.040
but that's just me.

22:47.040 --> 22:48.240
But right, let me finish this team,

22:48.240 --> 22:49.360
we'll actually jump into the game,

22:49.360 --> 22:51.440
because I have been yapping for 20 minutes,

22:51.440 --> 22:54.360
I'm not even, oh that's ridiculous, sorry, I'm so sorry.

22:56.360 --> 22:57.960
Goodness gravy, once I get started,

22:57.960 --> 23:00.360
I can't even stop, 20 freaking two minutes.

23:03.200 --> 23:04.680
That is terrible.

23:04.680 --> 23:06.320
Are you looking for clippers?

23:06.320 --> 23:09.640
Mm, if you look on Mercy's most recent short,

23:09.640 --> 23:13.480
if you can do clips like that, that's pre-made stuff,

23:13.480 --> 23:16.600
where I just send you the model and the audio,

23:16.600 --> 23:19.000
and then you do the subtitling and all the other fancy,

23:19.000 --> 23:19.840
like,

23:21.360 --> 23:23.720
then yes, definitely apply.

23:23.720 --> 23:26.520
If you mean clipping highlight sections in general,

23:27.680 --> 23:31.600
again, I'm gonna see what happens after Gelt's stream.

23:35.560 --> 23:37.960
Ah, okay, I finished my tea.

23:37.960 --> 23:39.200
I came for the yapping, honestly.

23:39.200 --> 23:40.040
Don't worry, there was two points,

23:40.040 --> 23:41.560
I was like half yapping, but it was so fun.

23:41.560 --> 23:42.400
Yes.

23:43.520 --> 23:45.600
Okay, what is this game about?

23:45.600 --> 23:48.480
Good question, I actually don't know.

23:48.480 --> 23:52.720
So all I know is it's called Needy Streamer Overload.

23:52.720 --> 23:55.440
I believe it is one girl,

23:55.440 --> 23:59.400
and there's a ton of different endings

23:59.400 --> 24:02.080
that we can potentially get,

24:02.080 --> 24:03.800
so we're gonna check it out, see how it is.

24:03.800 --> 24:05.440
I believe it's a click simulator,

24:05.440 --> 24:07.280
so I can't get annoyed at the gameplay,

24:07.280 --> 24:08.440
because this is my kind of thing,

24:08.440 --> 24:11.440
like, nice chill, doing my thing.

24:11.440 --> 24:13.120
Vealur, where the company competition

24:13.120 --> 24:16.160
is actually just who's the biggest yapper, honestly.

24:16.160 --> 24:19.320
20 minute talking, no gameplay, if you can show me.

24:19.320 --> 24:22.120
Honestly, this game is a feature for Life Simulator.

24:22.120 --> 24:22.960
Is it actually?

24:22.960 --> 24:23.960
Okay, that's good, that's good.

24:23.960 --> 24:26.160
I was gonna play YouTube Simulator,

24:26.160 --> 24:29.160
and then I was gonna call it like, well, Vealur fail.

24:30.000 --> 24:35.000
Okay, okay, so there's day progressions, okay?

24:36.560 --> 24:37.880
Okay, you ready?

24:39.920 --> 24:43.840
Welcome, day one of five.

24:45.720 --> 24:46.720
Man, wait, no.

24:46.720 --> 24:50.240
Got the stream account, time to log in and get ready.

24:50.240 --> 24:52.640
Click on stream and log in with my,

24:54.000 --> 24:58.640
thank you for the tip, Joshua Jones, 22.

24:58.720 --> 25:00.560
Oh, there's a cat, oh my god.

25:00.560 --> 25:01.760
Meow, meow.

25:01.760 --> 25:04.440
Click on stream and log in with the password

25:04.440 --> 25:08.920
angelkawaii2, log in.

25:09.680 --> 25:12.680
Oh, wait, like angelkawaii2.

25:15.160 --> 25:17.160
Sorry, I do things phonetically.

25:18.880 --> 25:21.200
I see, you've logged in, this is it, we're,

25:22.160 --> 25:25.040
this is where, oh no, everyone knows I can't read now.

25:25.040 --> 25:26.240
Ah, it's got to fast.

25:26.240 --> 25:28.240
We'll be together no matter what happens online,

25:28.240 --> 25:31.040
whether I die or I get arrested or I break,

25:31.040 --> 25:33.880
or I get stabbed or I get flamed,

25:33.880 --> 25:36.680
or I become god or go crazy.

25:36.680 --> 25:39.560
But Jenga, thank you for the tip as well.

25:39.560 --> 25:40.400
That's got to happen,

25:40.400 --> 25:41.720
the main reason I'm here for overall,

25:41.720 --> 25:43.120
thank you for the tip.

25:44.240 --> 25:46.560
We'll be together no matter what happens.

25:46.560 --> 25:50.120
The internet is truly the festering cesspool of heck,

25:50.120 --> 25:52.280
born from modern society.

25:53.280 --> 25:56.560
But even so, I have nowhere else to turn to.

25:56.560 --> 25:58.720
You're squidding me right now.

25:58.720 --> 26:00.280
Doctor Resurgence, thank you for the tip.

26:00.280 --> 26:02.240
Okay, you're awesome and I love your accent.

26:02.240 --> 26:04.880
Thank you so much for the tip, I appreciate it.

26:04.880 --> 26:06.400
Cause I have trouble getting out of bed in the morning.

26:06.400 --> 26:07.560
I don't want to get out.

26:07.560 --> 26:10.480
I don't want to get a proper job.

26:10.480 --> 26:13.200
No, she's a need, no.

26:13.200 --> 26:16.280
I'm scared of other people, adults pee me off

26:16.280 --> 26:18.760
and I'm bum bum, I'm dum dum.

26:18.760 --> 26:22.240
And I still want everyone to fawn over me.

26:22.240 --> 26:26.320
She wants to be an idol and streamers get fawned over

26:27.160 --> 26:29.720
and the most, over the most right now.

26:29.720 --> 26:30.880
Oh God, everyone knows I can't read.

26:30.880 --> 26:35.280
So that's why I want to be one.

26:35.280 --> 26:37.120
Thanks for sizing up all my gear

26:37.120 --> 26:38.800
and getting my streams off while you're running.

26:38.800 --> 26:42.040
Peach and, my name's Pete.

26:42.040 --> 26:43.480
Heck yeah, my name's Pete.

26:45.120 --> 26:46.280
When I send you a DM,

26:46.280 --> 26:48.160
you can sometimes fix your own reply.

26:48.160 --> 26:49.680
When the time comes,

26:49.680 --> 26:52.320
make sure you think long and hard what to say.

26:52.460 --> 26:53.460
Peach and.

26:54.360 --> 26:55.220
Peach on.

26:57.840 --> 27:00.240
Yep, you're my Peach and cause you're so.

27:00.240 --> 27:03.240
Oh, wait, we're the manager.

27:03.240 --> 27:04.480
We're the manager.

27:04.480 --> 27:05.640
I mean, you're the only,

27:05.640 --> 27:08.120
this is the people that have been emailing the website.

27:08.120 --> 27:09.460
That's all I'm going to say when they're like,

27:09.460 --> 27:11.600
I want to be a talent manager and have no Thanks.

27:11.600 --> 27:13.000
I mean, you're the only person in the world

27:13.000 --> 27:14.040
who understands and supports me

27:14.040 --> 27:16.040
and you're my one true love and you're also

27:16.040 --> 27:17.740
like my producer, so fit,

27:17.740 --> 27:19.600
oh, this is the freaking scar.

27:19.600 --> 27:21.480
Okay, you're super smart.

27:21.480 --> 27:24.120
No, you're super smart for naming them unlike me.

27:24.120 --> 27:27.660
So you can gave me, you can tell me or anything and I'll do it.

27:27.660 --> 27:29.760
Let's do this, let's do this, let's do this, let's do this,

27:29.760 --> 27:32.480
let's do this, let's do this, let's do this, let's do this.

27:32.480 --> 27:35.160
Oh, it's almost time.

27:35.160 --> 27:37.720
My makeup looks good, got my wig.

27:37.720 --> 27:38.880
Perfect.

27:38.880 --> 27:40.440
Here we go.

27:40.440 --> 27:43.140
Here we go, it's time for my first and go.

27:47.960 --> 27:49.160
Wait, this is late.

27:50.160 --> 27:54.160
Wait, this is good though.

27:56.160 --> 27:59.160
That would not have been cheap to...

27:59.160 --> 28:04.160
During each stream, you can delete the annoying comments and choose two coloured comments.

28:04.160 --> 28:05.160
Super chat.

28:05.160 --> 28:07.160
Keep your cursor in the comment section.

28:07.160 --> 28:08.160
What?

28:08.160 --> 28:13.160
Keeping your cursor in the comment section will slow the game down a little to make things a bit easier.

28:13.160 --> 28:15.160
Kawaii ne.

28:15.160 --> 28:17.160
Ohai wo gozaimasu.

28:17.160 --> 28:19.160
Nice, cheery.

28:19.160 --> 28:20.160
Cute.

28:20.160 --> 28:21.160
What?

28:21.160 --> 28:22.160
Stream as usual.

28:29.160 --> 28:30.160
As usual.

28:30.160 --> 28:31.160
God, you're so cute, cute.

28:31.160 --> 28:32.160
Kawaii ne.

28:32.160 --> 28:35.160
Alright, so we're playing Mod Simulator on Ironical.

28:35.160 --> 28:37.160
Wait, YouTube Mod Simulator.

28:38.160 --> 28:40.160
Choosing comments.

28:42.160 --> 28:44.160
Weird name.

28:45.160 --> 28:47.160
Kei Angel.

28:47.160 --> 28:48.160
Kanjo?

28:48.160 --> 28:49.160
Weird name.

28:49.160 --> 28:50.160
Parish!

28:53.160 --> 28:57.160
Array of light, illuminating the chaotic internet of today.

29:00.160 --> 29:06.160
Bringing happiness to the nerds, floating in this electronic sea.

29:08.160 --> 29:10.160
Can I type myself?

29:11.160 --> 29:14.160
Wait, so she gets stressed if I miss stuff?

29:14.160 --> 29:16.160
Oh boy, here come the nerds in the comment.

29:18.160 --> 29:21.160
We're all here just to vibe?

29:23.160 --> 29:26.160
So don't be mean.

29:26.160 --> 29:28.160
We're all just here to vibe.

29:28.160 --> 29:30.160
There's no point in starting calling each other nerds.

29:30.160 --> 29:31.160
We're all just trying to enjoy ourselves.

29:31.160 --> 29:33.160
A promise of future peace.

29:33.160 --> 29:35.160
I'm a little manic and moody, but that's alright.

29:35.160 --> 29:37.160
Don't go depression on us.

29:37.160 --> 29:39.160
Does that mean?

29:39.160 --> 29:41.160
I don't know if it's mean or not.

29:41.160 --> 29:42.160
I wouldn't care.

29:42.160 --> 29:45.160
I feel like I'm deleting all the comments.

29:45.160 --> 29:46.160
Go get therapy.

29:46.160 --> 29:47.160
No, right.

29:47.160 --> 29:49.160
No, don't be mean so hard.

29:49.160 --> 29:52.160
The internet angel has descended.

29:53.160 --> 29:55.160
Thank you for gracing us.

29:55.160 --> 29:56.160
Cheers.

29:57.160 --> 29:58.160
Yeah, read it.

29:58.160 --> 30:00.160
Oh, I can tell her to read it.

30:00.160 --> 30:01.160
Okay, okay, okay.

30:02.160 --> 30:03.160
Let's go.

30:04.160 --> 30:05.160
Let's go.

30:06.160 --> 30:08.160
We got a little Minecraft.

30:10.160 --> 30:16.160
Wait, wait, wait, get out of here.

30:17.160 --> 30:19.160
No, don't read it.

30:19.160 --> 30:20.160
Delete it.

30:22.160 --> 30:24.160
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, delete it.

30:24.160 --> 30:25.160
You silly sausage.

30:27.160 --> 30:29.160
No, don't delete it.

30:29.160 --> 30:30.160
Why?

30:32.160 --> 30:33.160
What was that?

30:33.160 --> 30:34.160
What was that?

30:38.160 --> 30:40.160
Or do I tailor to...

30:40.160 --> 30:41.160
Okay, I don't...

30:41.160 --> 30:42.160
For goodness sake.

30:42.160 --> 30:44.160
I'm a rubbish mod, honestly.

30:44.160 --> 30:45.160
So when are you going to show us...

30:45.160 --> 30:47.160
See, I would leave that in because I've been like...

30:47.160 --> 30:49.160
I've got bikini models.

30:49.160 --> 30:51.160
I'm the terrible mod.

30:51.160 --> 30:52.160
I feel like...

30:52.160 --> 30:53.160
I don't mind.

30:53.160 --> 30:57.160
If it's a way for you to get your stuff out, then sure.

30:57.160 --> 31:01.160
And while I'm at it, I'm going to be the biggest streamer on YouTube.

31:01.160 --> 31:02.160
That's a threat and a promise.

31:02.160 --> 31:04.160
Oh my God, threaten us more Kangol.

31:04.160 --> 31:06.160
Is it Kangol or K-Angel?

31:06.160 --> 31:08.160
I feel like Kangol sounds like Kigo.

31:08.160 --> 31:10.160
Right, group Kigo exercises replaying.

31:10.160 --> 31:12.160
You've got my support.

31:12.160 --> 31:13.160
Go big or go home.

31:13.160 --> 31:16.160
So I'm going to shoot for a million.

31:16.160 --> 31:17.160
Jesus, lady.

31:18.160 --> 31:19.160
You've got my support.

31:19.160 --> 31:20.160
Yeah.

31:20.160 --> 31:21.160
K-Angel.

31:21.160 --> 31:22.160
Kawaii Angel.

31:22.160 --> 31:24.160
Oh, Pepega.

31:24.160 --> 31:25.160
She literally...

31:25.160 --> 31:28.160
An interesting newbie has appeared.

31:28.160 --> 31:31.160
No one even freaking types newbie like that.

31:31.160 --> 31:32.160
That's ridiculous.

31:32.160 --> 31:35.160
Show us what you've got, baby.

31:37.160 --> 31:39.160
Anyway, there's still a lot I have to...

31:39.160 --> 31:41.160
Anyway, there's still a lot I have to learn.

31:41.160 --> 31:42.160
But I'm still going to be here.

31:42.160 --> 31:44.160
I can't wait to meet you all.

31:44.160 --> 31:45.160
I think that's what she sounds like.

31:45.160 --> 31:47.160
Nice to meet you.

31:47.160 --> 31:49.160
To meet you nice.

31:49.160 --> 31:51.160
Time for a challenge.

31:53.160 --> 31:55.160
Thank you for greeting us.

31:57.160 --> 31:59.160
I'm K-Angel.

31:59.160 --> 32:01.160
Go home.

32:01.160 --> 32:03.160
Get out of here.

32:03.160 --> 32:04.160
Oops.

32:04.160 --> 32:06.160
I don't think I was supposed to do it.

32:06.160 --> 32:08.160
You get out of here.

32:10.160 --> 32:14.160
Oh, and if you're a backseat gamer, do me a favor and stay away please.

32:14.160 --> 32:16.160
Well, what's wrong with freaking getting your hand held?

32:16.160 --> 32:17.160
They're games.

32:17.160 --> 32:18.160
Nice to meet you.

32:18.160 --> 32:19.160
Subscribbled.

32:19.160 --> 32:20.160
The birth of a legend.

32:20.160 --> 32:22.160
First stream complete.

32:22.160 --> 32:25.160
At the end of the stream, I will respond to the comments you choose.

32:25.160 --> 32:27.160
The fans love that, so...

32:27.160 --> 32:30.160
Aren't I so kind and generous?

32:30.160 --> 32:31.160
I guess.

32:31.160 --> 32:32.160
Tweeter.

32:32.160 --> 32:33.160
Hi, everyone.

32:33.160 --> 32:34.160
Wow, this is my first...

32:34.160 --> 32:36.160
This is my first time meeting all of you.

32:36.160 --> 32:37.160
Oh my god.

32:37.160 --> 32:38.160
You're an internet angel.

32:38.160 --> 32:40.160
What did you guys think of my first meet?

32:40.160 --> 32:42.160
I hope you're right.

32:42.160 --> 32:44.160
Oh, I can't read that fast.

32:47.160 --> 32:48.160
Oh my god.

32:50.160 --> 32:51.160
Oh my god, I'm still shaking.

32:51.160 --> 32:53.160
Did you like my performance on stream though?

32:53.160 --> 32:54.160
So when she...

32:54.160 --> 32:56.160
Her voice is deep here.

32:56.160 --> 33:00.160
Kate Angel finally descended upon the world after we spent so long mulling over it.

33:00.160 --> 33:02.160
We've got a thousand more subscribers, huh?

33:02.160 --> 33:03.160
But that's not enough.

33:03.160 --> 33:05.160
I want more people to fawn over me.

33:05.160 --> 33:08.160
We're only just getting started.

33:12.160 --> 33:14.160
I like that bunches.

33:14.160 --> 33:15.160
Best design.

33:15.160 --> 33:21.160
I need at least one million fans to satisfy my desperate need for approval.

33:21.160 --> 33:23.160
That's crazy dialogue.

33:23.160 --> 33:25.160
I wonder what dev team made this.

33:25.160 --> 33:26.160
We got to get that.

33:26.160 --> 33:28.160
We got to...

33:28.160 --> 33:31.160
We got to get to that within our month.

33:31.160 --> 33:33.160
That's the most motivation I've got.

33:33.160 --> 33:35.160
Oh, she's done it in a month!

33:35.160 --> 33:38.160
So let's make this month count.

33:38.160 --> 33:39.160
Okay, we have 30 days.

33:39.160 --> 33:44.160
We can make Kate Angel the biggest streamer in the world if we work together, right?

33:44.160 --> 33:45.160
Yeah.

33:46.160 --> 33:47.160
Yup.

33:49.160 --> 33:51.160
I love you so much.

33:51.160 --> 33:52.160
Oh my god.

33:52.160 --> 33:54.160
I really hope we can pull this off.

33:54.160 --> 33:56.160
We're counting on you, pizza!

33:57.160 --> 33:58.160
We're going to make it happen.

33:58.160 --> 33:59.160
It's her dream.

33:59.160 --> 34:00.160
We have to make it happen.

34:00.160 --> 34:03.160
I might break if you push me too hard,

34:03.160 --> 34:07.160
but when that happens, we can just destroy the internet.

34:10.160 --> 34:14.160
And anyway, I'll be counting on you tomorrow too.

34:16.160 --> 34:17.160
Good night.

34:19.160 --> 34:21.160
Okay, so it's a 30-day sim.

34:21.160 --> 34:22.160
Okay, okay.

34:22.160 --> 34:23.160
Day two.

34:24.160 --> 34:25.160
Good morning.

34:25.160 --> 34:27.160
It's my first morning as an official streamer.

34:27.160 --> 34:29.160
Wait, it's already noon.

34:29.160 --> 34:32.160
I'm just not a morning person at all.

34:36.160 --> 34:38.160
I was a bit too slow on that.

34:38.160 --> 34:40.160
Anyway, since we're aiming for 1 million subscribers,

34:40.160 --> 34:45.160
we still need 9,000 more.

34:46.160 --> 34:50.160
But first, let's start small and go for 10k first.

34:50.160 --> 34:52.160
We'll get there in no time.

34:54.160 --> 34:57.160
And as you know, I'm completely useless on my own.

35:00.160 --> 35:02.160
So you need to tell me what to do every day.

35:02.160 --> 35:04.160
I know you'll make the right...

35:04.160 --> 35:06.160
Is this terrible of me to say?

35:06.160 --> 35:09.160
But as a manager point of view,

35:09.160 --> 35:13.160
it's actually super easy to direct people like this.

35:14.160 --> 35:16.160
Just tell me what to do and I'll do it.

35:18.160 --> 35:20.160
So I'll do everything you tell me.

35:20.160 --> 35:22.160
Really, I have complete faith in you, pizza.

35:22.160 --> 35:24.160
I'll follow all your orders perfectly.

35:24.160 --> 35:27.160
And I promise I'll become the best streamer.

35:27.160 --> 35:30.160
Literally, I feel so bad.

35:30.160 --> 35:33.160
But this is the perfect employee.

35:35.160 --> 35:38.160
Because if not, I think I'll break and fall apart.

35:38.160 --> 35:39.160
Or I could break you.

35:41.160 --> 35:42.160
I don't want to be...

35:42.160 --> 35:43.160
Oh, fuck it, I'm fucking her.

35:43.160 --> 35:45.160
Or I could break you myself.

35:45.160 --> 35:47.160
Yeah, you could.

35:47.160 --> 35:48.160
Oh my...

35:48.160 --> 35:49.160
Wait, she reciprocates.

35:52.160 --> 35:53.160
Oh my god.

35:53.160 --> 35:55.160
Oh my god, I'm sorry.

35:55.160 --> 35:58.160
I'm sorry, my penis typed that on the keyboard.

35:58.160 --> 36:00.160
I'm sorry, I couldn't...

36:00.160 --> 36:01.160
Gum in the side.

36:01.160 --> 36:03.160
I'm sorry.

36:03.160 --> 36:05.160
Please don't be creeped out by a manager like that.

36:05.160 --> 36:06.160
Right, how do I tell her?

36:06.160 --> 36:07.160
Are we done?

36:10.160 --> 36:11.160
Hang out.

36:11.160 --> 36:12.160
Oh!

36:12.160 --> 36:13.160
Okay, okay, hang out.

36:13.160 --> 36:14.160
New idea incoming.

36:14.160 --> 36:15.160
Sleep.

36:15.160 --> 36:16.160
New idea incoming.

36:16.160 --> 36:17.160
New...

36:17.160 --> 36:18.160
I...

36:18.160 --> 36:19.160
Medication!

36:19.160 --> 36:21.160
Oh dear, that's not good.

36:21.160 --> 36:23.160
Oh, she feels okay.

36:24.160 --> 36:26.160
So I'm definitely...

36:26.160 --> 36:28.160
Mental darkness.

36:28.160 --> 36:30.160
Wow, okay.

36:31.160 --> 36:32.160
Oh wait, what does that say?

36:32.160 --> 36:34.160
Collect ideas.

36:34.160 --> 36:35.160
Okay!

36:36.160 --> 36:38.160
I comprehend.

36:38.160 --> 36:40.160
To collect ideas,

36:40.160 --> 36:42.160
I want you to search the internet

36:42.160 --> 36:44.160
for the current Twitter trend

36:44.160 --> 36:46.160
of a VTuber model.

36:47.160 --> 36:49.160
Social media.

36:49.160 --> 36:50.160
Social media.

36:50.160 --> 36:52.160
Puts her stress up.

36:53.160 --> 36:54.160
Pre-streamer.

36:54.160 --> 36:56.160
Vanity search.

36:56.160 --> 36:58.160
No, don't do that.

36:58.160 --> 37:00.160
Video streaming?

37:01.160 --> 37:02.160
No.

37:03.160 --> 37:05.160
What's ST?

37:05.160 --> 37:06.160
I don't know.

37:06.160 --> 37:07.160
Dender.

37:07.160 --> 37:09.160
No, you don't need dender, hen.

37:09.160 --> 37:11.160
Go follow the latest VTuber trend.

37:11.160 --> 37:12.160
I don't care what it is,

37:12.160 --> 37:14.160
but go do it for me, darling.

37:15.160 --> 37:17.160
Someone I met for the first time today

37:17.160 --> 37:19.160
told me you look like you would be

37:19.160 --> 37:21.160
really into underground male idols.

37:21.160 --> 37:23.160
Do I really?

37:24.160 --> 37:27.160
The task manager will show you...

37:28.160 --> 37:30.160
Oh, I'm learning, I'm learning.

37:30.160 --> 37:32.160
Conspiracy theories are always so interesting to read about.

37:32.160 --> 37:34.160
It's so funny seeing people argue about

37:34.160 --> 37:37.160
whether they are real or absolute BS.

37:37.160 --> 37:39.160
I never get tired of it.

37:39.160 --> 37:40.160
Okay, okay.

37:42.160 --> 37:44.160
You're actually...

37:44.160 --> 37:46.160
so smart?

37:46.160 --> 37:47.160
I don't...

37:47.160 --> 37:48.160
idea gotten.

37:48.160 --> 37:50.160
But you know, I feel like if you go deep enough,

37:50.160 --> 37:52.160
you'll end up buying into it.

37:52.160 --> 37:54.160
Sooner or later, curiosity killed the cat kind of deal.

37:54.160 --> 37:55.160
Well, I'm fine though.

37:55.160 --> 37:57.160
I never let that happen to me.

37:57.160 --> 38:00.160
I'm the most rational and logical girl in the world,

38:00.160 --> 38:03.160
and the only thing that drives me crazy is you.

38:03.160 --> 38:05.160
Okay, if it's reciprocated love,

38:05.160 --> 38:08.160
then I don't feel bad about being weird.

38:08.160 --> 38:12.160
But anyway, I figured that conspiracy theories

38:12.160 --> 38:14.160
would make for great content,

38:14.160 --> 38:16.160
so let's start this off with a banger.

38:16.160 --> 38:18.160
Okay, okay.

38:18.160 --> 38:20.160
We can only stream once for the idea we get

38:20.160 --> 38:22.160
from commands marked with an exclamation mark.

38:22.160 --> 38:24.160
If we stream with a low level idea,

38:24.160 --> 38:28.160
we'll be able to find another idea on the next level up.

38:28.160 --> 38:30.160
Comprehend, yes.

38:30.160 --> 38:32.160
Go to dust.

38:33.160 --> 38:35.160
Is that my only choice?

38:35.160 --> 38:37.160
I don't really want to cross her out.

38:39.160 --> 38:41.160
Okay, it's making me go to dust.

38:42.160 --> 38:47.160
I think I messed up your mediflicks recommendation,

38:47.160 --> 38:50.160
because I was using your account to watch stuff.

38:50.160 --> 38:52.160
I'm sorry, that's fine.

38:52.160 --> 38:54.160
Wait, you can't stream...

38:54.160 --> 38:56.160
Do you actually need to go to bed?

38:57.160 --> 38:59.160
Is she tired already?

38:59.160 --> 39:01.160
Do you need to sweep, little one?

39:01.160 --> 39:03.160
Or do you need to go again?

39:03.160 --> 39:05.160
Does she...

39:05.160 --> 39:07.160
Do you want to do internet again?

39:07.160 --> 39:10.160
Pre-stream alert goes up, but her stress...

39:11.160 --> 39:13.160
It will change time tonight.

39:13.160 --> 39:15.160
Okay, okay.

39:17.160 --> 39:19.160
I wanted to buy myself a super comfy couch,

39:19.160 --> 39:22.160
but if I did that, I think I would never leave it.

39:22.160 --> 39:24.160
I think it would turn into a blob.

39:24.160 --> 39:27.160
Go to night, and then she can stream.

39:27.160 --> 39:29.160
So she can stream at night.

39:29.160 --> 39:31.160
Can I want to dye my hair pink something?

39:31.160 --> 39:34.160
I think even more people would love me if I did that.

39:35.160 --> 39:37.160
Pink is definitely an idol hair.

39:37.160 --> 39:40.160
Colour for VTubers is very common.

39:40.160 --> 39:44.160
I actually didn't want pink VTuber,

39:44.160 --> 39:46.160
but I think purple would have a pink one.

39:46.160 --> 39:48.160
In general, let's be honest.

39:50.160 --> 39:52.160
Right, chat and chill, all hail the internet.

39:52.160 --> 39:53.160
I think that's it.

39:53.160 --> 39:55.160
So this is her doing her 2.0, so we'll do that.

39:55.160 --> 39:57.160
So, begin.

39:58.160 --> 40:00.160
Transform!

40:05.160 --> 40:06.160
Honestly?

40:06.160 --> 40:08.160
I'm digging this so far.

40:08.160 --> 40:11.160
This is already blooming out of expectation.

40:11.160 --> 40:12.160
Out of the war.

40:13.160 --> 40:15.160
Okay, very, very, very.

40:15.160 --> 40:17.160
Stream speed as usual.

40:17.160 --> 40:19.160
Hi cuties!

40:19.160 --> 40:21.160
I'm the internet angel.

40:21.160 --> 40:24.160
I kind of sound like...

40:24.160 --> 40:28.160
What the heck, the rabbit from Sonic Heroes?

40:29.160 --> 40:32.160
Why does she always say bless or whatever?

40:33.160 --> 40:35.160
Clearly because she's...

40:35.160 --> 40:37.160
You're blessed to have her in our life.

40:37.160 --> 40:39.160
You're so quiet. You're super cute.

40:43.160 --> 40:44.160
Feeling a bit blue so I'll be lurking?

40:44.160 --> 40:45.160
Lurk away.

40:45.160 --> 40:46.160
More than welcome.

40:46.160 --> 40:47.160
Hopefully feel a bit better soon.

40:47.160 --> 40:50.160
I love the internet because all of the lovely people

40:50.160 --> 40:52.160
are willing to listen to you alone

40:52.160 --> 40:54.160
and other intentional...

40:54.160 --> 40:55.160
Parish!

40:55.160 --> 40:57.160
Why, angel?

40:58.160 --> 41:00.160
Thank you for your super chat.

41:00.160 --> 41:01.160
I love you.

41:01.160 --> 41:02.160
I keep reading that.

41:02.160 --> 41:03.160
It's Kigo.

41:03.160 --> 41:04.160
I'm not even gonna pretend otherwise.

41:04.160 --> 41:06.160
My biggest fear is sentiment.

41:06.160 --> 41:09.160
I can imagine living a life not being needed by anyone.

41:11.160 --> 41:13.160
No, this is too real.

41:14.160 --> 41:16.160
Oh no, we're about to put on Mr. Kitty.

41:16.160 --> 41:20.160
As the hours pass on, you'll live to know.

41:23.160 --> 41:25.160
She sure is bold for a new streamer.

41:28.160 --> 41:30.160
Did I need to speed this up?

41:31.160 --> 41:32.160
Uh-huh.

41:32.160 --> 41:34.160
I love you guys for hearing me out.

41:34.160 --> 41:36.160
I'll keep working my hearts for all of you.

41:39.160 --> 41:41.160
She says she loves me.

41:41.160 --> 41:42.160
She loves me?

41:42.160 --> 41:43.160
She loves me?

41:43.160 --> 41:44.160
She loves me?

41:44.160 --> 41:45.160
I don't know about the rest of you,

41:45.160 --> 41:46.160
but your face sure is cute.

41:46.160 --> 41:47.160
Okay.

41:47.160 --> 41:48.160
Well, I love it.

41:48.160 --> 41:50.160
This is the true mod experience.

41:50.160 --> 41:51.160
Honestly.

41:51.160 --> 41:52.160
Can I speed this up?

41:52.160 --> 41:53.160
No, I can.

41:54.160 --> 41:55.160
I guess.

41:56.160 --> 41:57.160
No takebacks now.

41:57.160 --> 41:59.160
Chin hands.

42:00.160 --> 42:02.160
Oh, this is chin hands?

42:02.160 --> 42:03.160
This pose?

42:03.160 --> 42:06.160
I got Mercy have chin hands toggle.

42:06.160 --> 42:09.160
Because it's all over if you get bored of me.

42:09.160 --> 42:11.160
And I don't want to die yet.

42:11.160 --> 42:12.160
Let's go.

42:12.160 --> 42:15.160
I'm gonna need more so quickly if I'm done.

42:15.160 --> 42:17.160
I didn't bring any more.

42:17.160 --> 42:18.160
Please don't die.

42:18.160 --> 42:19.160
Please don't die.

42:20.160 --> 42:21.160
Oh no.

42:24.160 --> 42:25.160
I'm bored.

42:25.160 --> 42:28.160
Why would you super tip I'm bored?

42:30.160 --> 42:33.160
Let's have a look see.

42:33.160 --> 42:34.160
Why Angel?

42:34.160 --> 42:37.160
I kind of messed up the super chats, but.

42:37.160 --> 42:40.160
I've always been an Angel since I was born.

42:40.160 --> 42:42.160
Because I'm just too kawaii.

42:43.160 --> 42:45.160
Please don't die.

42:47.160 --> 42:48.160
People die.

42:48.160 --> 42:50.160
And whether I live or die is all up to my bet.

42:50.160 --> 42:52.160
Whoa, steady on.

42:54.160 --> 42:55.160
Oh well.

42:55.160 --> 42:57.160
What a stream.

42:58.160 --> 43:00.160
Thanks to everyone who came along to stream today.

43:00.160 --> 43:02.160
Sorry I haven't spent all of my plays.

43:02.160 --> 43:03.160
I'm so new to this.

43:03.160 --> 43:04.160
Love you all.

43:05.160 --> 43:09.160
I never caught on days when Kegel streams.

43:09.160 --> 43:10.160
I'm so good.

43:10.160 --> 43:11.160
I can't read it.

43:11.160 --> 43:12.160
Right.

43:15.160 --> 43:16.160
Oh.

43:18.160 --> 43:20.160
Dear P-chan.

43:20.160 --> 43:23.160
This is Saito from Little Bet Creations.

43:23.160 --> 43:25.160
As per our last phone call,

43:25.160 --> 43:28.160
your rent is still outstanding and you will have to pay.

43:28.160 --> 43:30.160
You have until the 10th to pay for-

43:30.160 --> 43:31.160
Oh my god, I'm going to get kicked out.

43:31.160 --> 43:34.160
Please forward your payment to the account details below

43:34.160 --> 43:36.160
and contact me when you've done so with regards.

43:36.160 --> 43:39.160
Please reply to this email with any concerns.

43:39.160 --> 43:40.160
I'm sorry.

43:40.160 --> 43:41.160
I'm sorry.

43:41.160 --> 43:42.160
What is this?

43:42.160 --> 43:45.160
Does this mean we need to pay all our rent by day 10?

43:45.160 --> 43:47.160
We're broke as heck.

43:47.160 --> 43:49.160
We need to be able to monetize our content ASAP.

43:49.160 --> 43:52.160
We need to get more than 10k followers first.

43:52.160 --> 43:53.160
Easy peasy for us.

43:53.160 --> 43:54.160
Let's go.

43:54.160 --> 43:55.160
Yes, yes, yes.

43:55.160 --> 43:57.160
Oh my god, you're such a hard worker.

43:57.160 --> 43:59.160
What the heck is that though?

43:59.160 --> 44:01.160
That little bear thing.

44:03.160 --> 44:04.160
Right.

44:04.160 --> 44:06.160
I need you to-

44:06.160 --> 44:09.160
Your stress is really high.

44:09.160 --> 44:11.160
How do I de-stress you?

44:12.160 --> 44:13.160
Hang out.

44:14.160 --> 44:16.160
Play game.

44:16.160 --> 44:19.160
Stress goes down by five-

44:19.160 --> 44:21.160
No, that's number four.

44:21.160 --> 44:22.160
That's four.

44:22.160 --> 44:24.160
Affection goes up between us.

44:24.160 --> 44:27.160
I don't want her to have to-

44:27.160 --> 44:28.160
What's this?

44:28.160 --> 44:30.160
Spend time together.

44:30.160 --> 44:34.160
Her affection goes up and her stress goes down by six units though.

44:36.160 --> 44:38.160
I think we'll do that.

44:38.160 --> 44:40.160
No, she needs-

44:40.160 --> 44:41.160
Wait.

44:42.160 --> 44:44.160
Wait, hold on.

44:44.160 --> 44:45.160
It says dot, dot, dot.

44:45.160 --> 44:47.160
Love is in the air.

44:47.160 --> 44:49.160
Stress goes down significantly but mental darkness-

44:49.160 --> 44:51.160
Mental darkness goes down.

44:51.160 --> 44:53.160
Affection goes up and stress goes down.

44:53.160 --> 44:55.160
This is a win-win.

44:56.160 --> 44:58.160
This is the most po-

44:58.160 --> 45:00.160
This is the best thing to make her feel better.

45:00.160 --> 45:02.160
Sorry, but...

45:03.160 --> 45:08.160
Is that that game where it's like 120 levels?

45:12.160 --> 45:16.160
I promised to never portray you guys, so please keep on showing me all your love.

45:17.160 --> 45:18.160
Oh!

45:18.160 --> 45:19.160
Noory.

45:19.160 --> 45:21.160
Noory Nelly.

45:23.160 --> 45:24.160
What taking?

45:24.160 --> 45:26.160
No, what?

45:26.160 --> 45:28.160
This shows how much pressure I'm feeling.

45:28.160 --> 45:30.160
I might start acting weird if I get too high, so watch out.

45:30.160 --> 45:34.160
I may even become more scared of the internet by the day.

45:36.160 --> 45:38.160
This displays how much I love you.

45:38.160 --> 45:41.160
I'd be sad if I don't love you enough, but if I love you too much,

45:41.160 --> 45:44.160
it might be hard to handle to try and strike a good balance.

45:44.160 --> 45:48.160
This lets you know how I'm doing mentally.

45:48.160 --> 45:50.160
How well I cope with reality will change.

45:50.160 --> 45:54.160
Depending on the numbers, it might have a bigger influence over my future,

45:54.160 --> 45:58.160
rather than in your future.

46:01.160 --> 46:06.160
Show me one hater who bothers to wear clothes that fit them properly.

46:06.160 --> 46:08.160
That's the most bizarre thing I've ever read.

46:08.160 --> 46:11.160
We're definitely gonna have to research tomorrow.

46:12.160 --> 46:14.160
We'll do conspiracies.

46:14.160 --> 46:16.160
Why are you here now?

46:16.160 --> 46:18.160
Transform!

46:19.160 --> 46:21.160
Time for her voice to go like this.

46:21.160 --> 46:23.160
Oh, way up there.

46:24.160 --> 46:26.160
Men here have each other similar?

46:26.160 --> 46:28.160
Is that how it goes?

46:28.160 --> 46:30.160
I know there's lots of end-ends, but...

46:30.160 --> 46:31.160
Thank you, ladies.

46:31.160 --> 46:32.160
It's okay, you two.

46:32.160 --> 46:34.160
We're a fixer who controls them.

46:34.160 --> 46:35.160
The fixer who controls them?

46:35.160 --> 46:37.160
What does that even mean?

46:37.160 --> 46:38.160
First time here.

46:38.160 --> 46:39.160
Oh, yeah.

46:40.160 --> 46:42.160
Is that streaming on TV?

46:42.160 --> 46:43.160
Oh, wait. No, sorry.

46:43.160 --> 46:45.160
I'm reading parts in the voice.

46:45.160 --> 46:47.160
I'm not supposed to.

46:48.160 --> 46:51.160
Do you think I can conspiracy theories?

46:52.160 --> 46:53.160
I do.

46:53.160 --> 46:54.160
I do.

46:54.160 --> 46:55.160
Have I read about them?

46:55.160 --> 46:56.160
But why?

46:58.160 --> 47:01.160
Young nerds love these.

47:01.160 --> 47:04.160
That's American viewer-spotted.

47:04.160 --> 47:06.160
Annihilate this man.

47:09.160 --> 47:11.160
Is this supposed to go faster than this?

47:12.160 --> 47:13.160
Oh, I love conspiracy theories.

47:13.160 --> 47:14.160
I'm excited.

47:14.160 --> 47:15.160
Yes.

47:15.160 --> 47:16.160
Okay.

47:16.160 --> 47:17.160
Do you like conspiracy?

47:17.160 --> 47:19.160
So, my company...

47:19.160 --> 47:20.160
I can...

47:20.160 --> 47:21.160
Please go again.

47:22.160 --> 47:23.160
Oh, that's going too fast.

47:23.160 --> 47:25.160
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

47:25.160 --> 47:28.160
Today, I'll be talking about their culture in conspiracy theories.

47:28.160 --> 47:29.160
Like, the fricking...

47:29.160 --> 47:32.160
Is it the ET game that's currently...

47:32.160 --> 47:34.160
dug into a ditch

47:34.160 --> 47:36.160
and it's like 40,000 worth of games or something?

47:36.160 --> 47:38.160
Some people say that...

47:39.160 --> 47:40.160
They develop organically.

47:40.160 --> 47:41.160
Oh, this is going too fast.

47:41.160 --> 47:43.160
They wanted to do the Japanese masses

47:43.160 --> 47:44.160
into nerds to numb them.

47:44.160 --> 47:45.160
Sounds wacky.

47:45.160 --> 47:47.160
But what if it did happen?

47:47.160 --> 47:49.160
I'm not a nerd.

47:51.160 --> 47:54.160
I think we'll do a nicer super chat.

47:54.160 --> 47:55.160
I think we could do a super chat

47:55.160 --> 47:57.160
that makes her happier than that.

47:57.160 --> 47:59.160
But then people get mad if you don't read them out.

48:00.160 --> 48:02.160
Everyone watching now would be dancing

48:02.160 --> 48:06.160
to the tune of three minds on...

48:07.160 --> 48:09.160
Feels like you're going to eventually

48:09.160 --> 48:11.160
go off the deep end if you...

48:12.160 --> 48:14.160
What, talking about conspiracies?

48:14.160 --> 48:16.160
But it's okay, because even if you...

48:16.160 --> 48:17.160
We're all...

48:17.160 --> 48:18.160
This...

48:21.160 --> 48:23.160
I can't even moderate it.

48:24.160 --> 48:25.160
I'm not a nerd.

48:25.160 --> 48:26.160
I...

48:26.160 --> 48:28.160
That's what a nerd says.

48:28.160 --> 48:29.160
And she's gone.

48:29.160 --> 48:30.160
Just like that.

48:30.160 --> 48:31.160
Jeez, right.

48:31.160 --> 48:32.160
I'm not clicking that speed up option.

48:32.160 --> 48:33.160
My goodness.

48:33.160 --> 48:34.160
What was that?

48:34.160 --> 48:35.160
You upped the stream speed,

48:35.160 --> 48:36.160
but I've tried to lower it.

48:36.160 --> 48:37.160
Did I not?

48:38.160 --> 48:39.160
Wait, is this her alt?

48:40.160 --> 48:41.160
I will...

48:42.160 --> 48:44.160
Shatalki Mushroom Yoll on my Privilege

48:44.160 --> 48:45.160
and will...

48:45.160 --> 48:47.160
As long as one finds that they can

48:47.160 --> 48:49.160
stay blissfully unaware.

48:49.160 --> 48:50.160
And even if someone does find it,

48:50.160 --> 48:51.160
it's not like I'm committing a crime.

48:51.160 --> 48:53.160
Even though it does feel like real, just...

48:53.160 --> 48:55.160
Wait, so this is her alt.

48:55.160 --> 48:57.160
Oh, and this is her mane.

48:58.160 --> 48:59.160
Oh, that's a shame.

48:59.160 --> 49:01.160
She doesn't even enjoy streaming.

49:02.160 --> 49:03.160
Then you do it then.

49:04.160 --> 49:05.160
So, but you didn't have to stream

49:05.160 --> 49:06.160
if you didn't like it.

49:06.160 --> 49:07.160
I don't know why we're...

49:07.160 --> 49:09.160
Can you write some good stuff about...

49:09.160 --> 49:11.160
Thingy on ST for me?

49:12.160 --> 49:15.160
I think it'll be too obvious

49:15.160 --> 49:17.160
if I do it myself, so please.

49:18.160 --> 49:19.160
Please.

49:21.160 --> 49:23.160
Medication gives her an idea.

49:24.160 --> 49:25.160
Diazipam?

49:29.160 --> 49:31.160
One milligram Diazipam

49:31.160 --> 49:33.160
makes her floppy.

49:34.160 --> 49:35.160
Brof.

49:36.160 --> 49:37.160
Brof.

49:37.160 --> 49:38.160
It's five milligrams

49:38.160 --> 49:40.160
that'll make you floppy, hen.

49:40.160 --> 49:42.160
It's not one milligram.

49:42.160 --> 49:43.160
One milligram does nothing.

49:43.160 --> 49:45.160
That's a tiddly wink of Diazipam.

49:47.160 --> 49:49.160
It's someone who's got the anxiety

49:49.160 --> 49:51.160
made, so I assure you, it's five milligrams

49:51.160 --> 49:53.160
is when you're gonna feel it.

49:53.160 --> 49:55.160
Right, I am going to let her

49:55.160 --> 49:57.160
get a new idea by playing games.

49:57.160 --> 49:58.160
She used to play some games.

49:58.160 --> 50:00.160
She's a lightweight, literally.

50:02.160 --> 50:04.160
All you need is a beat a blocker

50:04.160 --> 50:05.160
and you're good to go.

50:05.160 --> 50:07.160
And if you're really not good to go,

50:07.160 --> 50:08.160
Diazipam.

50:08.160 --> 50:10.160
I hit my gacha a bunch of all right.

50:11.160 --> 50:12.160
We just paid money for that!

50:12.160 --> 50:13.160
Did you just spend money

50:13.160 --> 50:15.160
when we have to pay rent?

50:15.160 --> 50:17.160
Nothing beats a good games.

50:18.160 --> 50:20.160
Humans were born to play

50:20.160 --> 50:22.160
and I'm getting the hang of this streaming thing,

50:22.160 --> 50:23.160
so I want to do a let's play.

50:23.160 --> 50:24.160
Let's do this.

50:24.160 --> 50:26.160
Yeah, that's exactly what you're supposed to do.

50:26.160 --> 50:28.160
Why are these reactions so scuffed?

50:29.160 --> 50:30.160
You have a new idea for stream.

50:30.160 --> 50:31.160
Let's play throwback stream.

50:31.160 --> 50:33.160
Hey, that's what I did!

50:33.160 --> 50:34.160
Go to dusk, go to dusk.

50:34.160 --> 50:37.160
Right, you can play again.

50:38.160 --> 50:39.160
I want you.

50:39.160 --> 50:40.160
I need you.

50:40.160 --> 50:41.160
I need you.

50:41.160 --> 50:42.160
I love you.

50:42.160 --> 50:43.160
I love you.

50:43.160 --> 50:46.160
Atama no naka.

50:47.160 --> 50:49.160
I don't know what the tune is,

50:49.160 --> 50:50.160
but I've probably heard it

50:50.160 --> 50:52.160
if it's that popular Japanese.

50:52.160 --> 50:53.160
I'll let her play twice

50:53.160 --> 50:55.160
so she can get two game things.

50:57.160 --> 50:59.160
Need to grind, need to grind,

50:59.160 --> 51:01.160
need to grind, need to grind, grind.

51:02.160 --> 51:04.160
So I put a stress by four

51:04.160 --> 51:05.160
and affection up,

51:05.160 --> 51:06.160
but I didn't do anything.

51:06.160 --> 51:08.160
I just remembered this game I played

51:08.160 --> 51:10.160
where you become a big shot

51:10.160 --> 51:11.160
who has a global influence

51:11.160 --> 51:12.160
or whatever I actually got

51:12.160 --> 51:14.160
so into it, I ended up skipping it.

51:14.160 --> 51:16.160
What game is that a reference to?

51:16.160 --> 51:18.160
I just remembered this game

51:19.160 --> 51:20.160
becomes some big shot

51:20.160 --> 51:23.160
who has global influence.

51:25.160 --> 51:26.160
What game?

51:26.160 --> 51:27.160
That must be a reference,

51:27.160 --> 51:28.160
but it's so generic.

51:30.160 --> 51:31.160
But anyway, I know it's recently

51:31.160 --> 51:32.160
a lot of people these days

51:32.160 --> 51:33.160
like to play games where you have to

51:33.160 --> 51:35.160
rule, power to rule the world

51:35.160 --> 51:37.160
and even reduce population and stuff.

51:38.160 --> 51:39.160
What are these references to?

51:39.160 --> 51:41.160
There must be references to.

51:41.160 --> 51:42.160
Is the game,

51:43.160 --> 51:45.160
is referencing itself?

51:45.160 --> 51:47.160
Oh, Papaga.

51:47.160 --> 51:49.160
That's very plausible.

51:49.160 --> 51:51.160
And some people also truly believe

51:51.160 --> 51:53.160
that's what's happening in our world

51:53.160 --> 51:55.160
and make up these wild boogie men

51:55.160 --> 51:57.160
to direct their rage at.

51:58.160 --> 51:59.160
Wait.

51:59.160 --> 52:00.160
Is this because I looked up

52:00.160 --> 52:02.160
that conspiracy stuff she's saying this?

52:02.160 --> 52:03.160
I don't blame them though.

52:03.160 --> 52:05.160
I think considering the times we live in

52:05.160 --> 52:07.160
it's not so strange that people want

52:07.160 --> 52:09.160
someone or something to be angry at.

52:10.160 --> 52:12.160
Not as, not as dissect

52:12.160 --> 52:13.160
in human nature.

52:13.160 --> 52:14.160
Hold on, this game is,

52:14.160 --> 52:15.160
I love it already.

52:15.160 --> 52:17.160
What the heck, we're like human nature.

52:17.160 --> 52:19.160
But we should all be working together.

52:19.160 --> 52:20.160
Please, this is my only wish

52:20.160 --> 52:21.160
as an internet angel.

52:21.160 --> 52:22.160
Wait, but I'm,

52:22.160 --> 52:24.160
I'm eating this up for breakfast.

52:24.160 --> 52:26.160
Like, I love the intricate

52:26.160 --> 52:28.160
like one human nature, like you need something to

52:28.160 --> 52:30.160
sounds good, doesn't it?

52:30.160 --> 52:31.160
Well, I'm gonna say that

52:31.160 --> 52:33.160
and see how the

52:33.160 --> 52:35.160
Schumer's React, they are my li-

52:38.160 --> 52:39.160
Girl.

52:39.160 --> 52:41.160
Do not bite the hand that feeds.

52:41.160 --> 52:42.160
My goodness.

52:43.160 --> 52:46.160
Oh no, she was talking about theories.

52:46.160 --> 52:48.160
I didn't, only one cover.

52:48.160 --> 52:50.160
Wait, am I gonna turn her into a politician?

52:51.160 --> 52:55.160
Can I turn her into anti-Margaret Thatcher?

52:55.160 --> 52:58.160
Please, can I turn her into our

52:58.160 --> 52:59.160
Margaret Thatcher?

53:00.160 --> 53:01.160
Stop.

53:02.160 --> 53:03.160
Stop, anti-Margaret Thatcher.

53:03.160 --> 53:04.160
Let's go.

53:04.160 --> 53:06.160
E-girl, anti-Margaret Thatcher.

53:07.160 --> 53:10.160
We believe in the public

53:10.160 --> 53:13.160
owning the fricking things

53:13.160 --> 53:15.160
and the private sector does not

53:15.160 --> 53:16.160
own or have stakes.

53:17.160 --> 53:20.160
And that the people do not buy out mistakes,

53:20.160 --> 53:22.160
buy out companies that go bust

53:22.160 --> 53:23.160
because it's not the people's problems

53:23.160 --> 53:25.160
for the private companies.

53:25.160 --> 53:26.160
Oh my God, yes!

53:26.160 --> 53:28.160
Revolution, yes!

53:28.160 --> 53:30.160
Oh my God, this game's amazing.

53:31.160 --> 53:33.160
Hi guys, it's Chloe Angel,

53:33.160 --> 53:35.160
the Napoleon of the Streaming Wall.

53:35.160 --> 53:36.160
Who's Napoleon?

53:36.160 --> 53:37.160
Right, not you.

53:37.160 --> 53:38.160
That's a terrible super chat

53:38.160 --> 53:39.160
and you should be embarrassed,

53:39.160 --> 53:40.160
but we'll put it in

53:40.160 --> 53:41.160
because we can take it out.

53:42.160 --> 53:44.160
No way we can do this.

53:45.160 --> 53:47.160
In 30 years, our world could be

53:47.160 --> 53:49.160
ruled by one body.

53:49.160 --> 53:51.160
Also, oh, we're too late for that.

53:51.160 --> 53:52.160
Conglomerates are screaming

53:52.160 --> 53:53.160
to create...

53:55.160 --> 53:57.160
Wait, I can't turn it off.

53:58.160 --> 53:59.160
What's a conglomerate?

53:59.160 --> 54:01.160
I've done another rabbit hole.

54:01.160 --> 54:03.160
The division has already begun.

54:03.160 --> 54:04.160
Oh, I haven't long ago.

54:04.160 --> 54:06.160
Conglomerates are scheming.

54:06.160 --> 54:07.160
They're even trying to reduce

54:07.160 --> 54:09.160
the world population to one billion.

54:09.160 --> 54:10.160
That's scary.

54:10.160 --> 54:12.160
I want to live in an equal society.

54:13.160 --> 54:14.160
I'll put it in because it's super chat,

54:14.160 --> 54:16.160
but we'll see if we can replace it with something else.

54:16.160 --> 54:17.160
What would the world be like

54:17.160 --> 54:19.160
ruled by one government?

54:19.160 --> 54:20.160
I don't know how I feel about

54:20.160 --> 54:21.160
worshiping a fallen angel

54:21.160 --> 54:23.160
being an angel myself.

54:23.160 --> 54:25.160
Lucifer, hold that guy.

54:25.160 --> 54:26.160
You can be my...

54:26.160 --> 54:27.160
You can be my fallen angel.

54:27.160 --> 54:28.160
Sorry, this is a chat.

54:28.160 --> 54:29.160
Keep freaking doing it wrong.

54:31.160 --> 54:33.160
I'm already taking action.

54:34.160 --> 54:36.160
Your frowny face is so cute.

54:39.160 --> 54:41.160
Is there any mean comments?

54:41.160 --> 54:43.160
I don't think I've seen any mean comments.

54:45.160 --> 54:46.160
Literally, we're playing

54:46.160 --> 54:47.160
the binding number Isaac right now.

54:47.160 --> 54:49.160
We've got biblical references.

54:51.160 --> 54:55.160
I'm kind of curious about

54:55.160 --> 54:56.160
that kind of world.

54:56.160 --> 54:58.160
Okay, we'll put that in.

54:59.160 --> 55:00.160
Wow.

55:01.160 --> 55:03.160
I assume if I don't...

55:03.160 --> 55:05.160
Like, if I skip this,

55:05.160 --> 55:06.160
I'll miss out on, like,

55:06.160 --> 55:08.160
she might get stressed.

55:09.160 --> 55:10.160
I'll have a peek at the comments.

55:10.160 --> 55:11.160
That's scary.

55:11.160 --> 55:12.160
I want to live in an equal society.

55:12.160 --> 55:13.160
Yeah, but then just sitting around

55:13.160 --> 55:14.160
and complaining,

55:14.160 --> 55:15.160
I'm going to change everything.

55:15.160 --> 55:16.160
Wait, I'm spying.

55:16.160 --> 55:17.160
No way!

55:17.160 --> 55:19.160
We're freaking starting a revolution

55:19.160 --> 55:21.160
as an e-girl, please!

55:21.160 --> 55:22.160
Yes, you can...

55:22.160 --> 55:23.160
I shall be the new...

55:23.160 --> 55:25.160
I'll be the new god of this world!

55:25.160 --> 55:27.160
Yes!

55:27.160 --> 55:29.160
Oh, my God!

55:29.160 --> 55:30.160
Yes!

55:30.160 --> 55:32.160
How do I make her do more of this?

55:32.160 --> 55:34.160
This is amazing.

55:35.160 --> 55:37.160
Oh, my God.

55:37.160 --> 55:39.160
Oh, no, it makes her shaky, though.

55:39.160 --> 55:41.160
Oh, I don't want her to be upset.

55:42.160 --> 55:43.160
No matter what you're doing,

55:43.160 --> 55:44.160
you're always bound to end up fighting

55:44.160 --> 55:45.160
one way or another.

55:45.160 --> 55:47.160
Those who do not fight will not survive.

55:47.160 --> 55:49.160
Look at my DM and stop ignoring me.

55:50.160 --> 55:51.160
I'm sorry!

55:51.160 --> 55:52.160
Where's your webcam?

55:52.160 --> 55:53.160
Oh, sorry.

55:55.160 --> 55:57.160
Oh, I thought I can head-patter.

55:57.160 --> 55:58.160
Can I?

55:59.160 --> 56:00.160
Obviously, the first thing you've got to check

56:00.160 --> 56:02.160
is that you can touch next to this section,

56:02.160 --> 56:03.160
but hey, ho...

56:03.160 --> 56:05.160
Oh, I can head-patter!

56:05.160 --> 56:06.160
Take that!

56:06.160 --> 56:07.160
You like that?

56:07.160 --> 56:08.160
Head-patter.

56:08.160 --> 56:09.160
Okay.

56:09.160 --> 56:11.160
I don't think I can talk to you right now.

56:11.160 --> 56:13.160
I've just been focusing on your career,

56:13.160 --> 56:14.160
so it's fine.

56:14.160 --> 56:15.160
It's fine.

56:17.160 --> 56:18.160
Ah.

56:18.160 --> 56:20.160
Alex Jones feature for art!

56:20.160 --> 56:23.160
I want her to, like, take over the world!

56:24.160 --> 56:26.160
I'm going to make an Amazon wish list.

56:26.160 --> 56:27.160
What should I put in it?

56:27.160 --> 56:29.160
Bath bomb costume and expensive mic.

56:29.160 --> 56:30.160
I have to do that.

56:30.160 --> 56:31.160
Expensive mic.

56:31.160 --> 56:33.160
The people need to hear your words!

56:33.160 --> 56:34.160
All right, that's it.

56:34.160 --> 56:35.160
Yes!

56:35.160 --> 56:37.160
The people need to hear you!

56:38.160 --> 56:40.160
So not Kawaii, Nate.

56:40.160 --> 56:41.160
Oh, my God.

56:41.160 --> 56:42.160
You're so Kawaii.

56:42.160 --> 56:43.160
Oh, she's blushing.

56:43.160 --> 56:44.160
You're so not cute.

56:49.160 --> 56:50.160
Okay.

56:50.160 --> 56:51.160
Okay.

56:54.160 --> 56:57.160
If this is you complaining about me not interacting with you,

56:57.160 --> 56:58.160
my lady,

56:58.160 --> 57:01.160
I have to say this is the most rubbish interaction

57:01.160 --> 57:03.160
I've ever seen before.

57:03.160 --> 57:05.160
We are sending each other emojis,

57:05.160 --> 57:06.160
and that's it.

57:06.160 --> 57:07.160
You're done.

57:07.160 --> 57:09.160
How do I make you do that thing again?

57:09.160 --> 57:10.160
How is...

57:10.160 --> 57:12.160
What was the one that made her get that row?

57:12.160 --> 57:14.160
I want her to do that right more.

57:15.160 --> 57:16.160
Her stress go-

57:16.160 --> 57:18.160
Oh, her stress is 61?

57:18.160 --> 57:20.160
Oh, that's so high.

57:22.160 --> 57:24.160
Her mental darkness goes up on social media.

57:24.160 --> 57:25.160
I don't want that.

57:29.160 --> 57:31.160
Daisling stops call.

57:31.160 --> 57:33.160
It makes you feel a streamer's voice is a lifeline,

57:33.160 --> 57:34.160
but it'll take too many,

57:34.160 --> 57:36.160
and stuff will happen.

57:36.160 --> 57:37.160
Okay.

57:37.160 --> 57:38.160
Everything just feels more manageable,

57:38.160 --> 57:40.160
and it makes you feel kind of floaty.

57:41.160 --> 57:42.160
Do we pop one?

57:45.160 --> 57:46.160
Fuck it.

57:46.160 --> 57:47.160
We'll pop it.

57:47.160 --> 57:49.160
What happens to her stress levels?

57:51.160 --> 57:52.160
Eh.

57:52.160 --> 57:53.160
Madame.

57:55.160 --> 57:56.160
Madame.

57:56.160 --> 57:57.160
Madame,

57:57.160 --> 57:59.160
you did not have to post that on the main account.

57:59.160 --> 58:00.160
So her stress went-

58:00.160 --> 58:01.160
Wait, that was it?

58:01.160 --> 58:03.160
The stress went down by one?

58:03.160 --> 58:04.160
That was pathetic.

58:04.160 --> 58:05.160
Don't ever do that again.

58:05.160 --> 58:06.160
That was rubbish.

58:06.160 --> 58:07.160
Oh, my God.

58:07.160 --> 58:08.160
She's high as a kite.

58:09.160 --> 58:12.160
You are in no state.

58:12.160 --> 58:14.160
Is this a jump scare here as well?

58:14.160 --> 58:16.160
You're in no state to stream.

58:17.160 --> 58:19.160
Yeah, you're in no straight.

58:20.160 --> 58:21.160
That was useless.

58:22.160 --> 58:24.160
You're not looking at my DMs as quickly as you used to.

58:24.160 --> 58:26.160
You don't care about my girlfriend.

58:27.160 --> 58:29.160
We got rent to make, honey!

58:29.160 --> 58:31.160
Get them yiddies out!

58:31.160 --> 58:33.160
I love you, but get them yiddies out.

58:33.160 --> 58:35.160
What are you talking about?

58:35.160 --> 58:37.160
Right, how did I get her to do that?

58:38.160 --> 58:40.160
Come on, become a politician!

58:40.160 --> 58:42.160
Go on social media!

58:42.160 --> 58:43.160
Oh, wait.

58:43.160 --> 58:44.160
I think you just put her stress up more.

58:44.160 --> 58:46.160
Oh, I'm really bad at this game.

58:47.160 --> 58:49.160
Feels like everyone is a little on edge.

58:49.160 --> 58:50.160
Is it because of something they did?

58:50.160 --> 58:52.160
Also, please remember the streamer and people too.

58:52.160 --> 58:53.160
Oh, my God.

58:53.160 --> 58:54.160
I see that tweet all the time.

58:54.160 --> 58:56.160
Honestly, this game's pretty mad.

58:56.160 --> 58:57.160
I have to admit.

58:57.160 --> 58:58.160
I don't know.

58:59.160 --> 59:02.160
But then, wait, so how'd I progress?

59:02.160 --> 59:04.160
I want more of this one.

59:04.160 --> 59:06.160
Take a dive into conspiracy world.

59:08.160 --> 59:09.160
I'm not allowed to do it.

59:09.160 --> 59:10.160
Or am I allowed to do it?

59:10.160 --> 59:11.160
No.

59:11.160 --> 59:13.160
I think it regurgitates the stream.

59:13.160 --> 59:14.160
So you can't do that.

59:15.160 --> 59:19.160
The next idea for conspiracy is on internet video streaming.

59:19.160 --> 59:20.160
Okay.

59:20.160 --> 59:22.160
Let's do a throwback to a game.

59:22.160 --> 59:24.160
I needed her stress.

59:24.160 --> 59:25.160
It's getting pretty bad.

59:25.160 --> 59:26.160
We're over 50%.

59:26.160 --> 59:29.160
We're at 56% stress levels.

59:30.160 --> 59:32.160
Oh, I didn't mean to skip that.

59:32.160 --> 59:33.160
But I did.

59:33.160 --> 59:34.160
You got a lot more stream ideas.

59:34.160 --> 59:35.160
Hey, cuties!

59:35.160 --> 59:37.160
I'm finding time for me to come.

59:37.160 --> 59:38.160
NICE never gets old.

59:40.160 --> 59:41.160
As usual.

59:41.160 --> 59:45.160
We're going to check out some truly ancient artifacts today.

59:45.160 --> 59:47.160
What, like Assassin's Creed Brotherhood?

59:48.160 --> 59:49.160
Goodness, gravy.

59:50.160 --> 59:51.160
I love games.

59:51.160 --> 59:52.160
I'm excited.

59:52.160 --> 59:53.160
What games are you playing?

59:54.160 --> 59:56.160
The chat would like to know.

59:57.160 --> 01:00:00.160
Hey, I'm just doing my algebra while listening to she's background music.

01:00:00.160 --> 01:00:03.160
It's such a good adaptation.

01:00:03.160 --> 01:00:05.160
See, this is so slow.

01:00:05.160 --> 01:00:07.160
But the next thing is so fast.

01:00:08.160 --> 01:00:09.160
Can I make her...

01:00:09.160 --> 01:00:11.160
Gamers, let's go.

01:00:11.160 --> 01:00:12.160
That's right.

01:00:12.160 --> 01:00:13.160
Gamers are in the most press.

01:00:13.160 --> 01:00:15.160
And play some flash games.

01:00:15.160 --> 01:00:18.160
Oh, I don't even remember any flash games, to be honest.

01:00:21.160 --> 01:00:23.160
Fancy pants.

01:00:23.160 --> 01:00:26.160
I think it's the only flash game I remember playing.

01:00:26.160 --> 01:00:28.160
It had like a mohawk.

01:00:28.160 --> 01:00:30.160
And it was just like a 2D.

01:00:30.160 --> 01:00:33.160
You look like you suck at games.

01:00:34.160 --> 01:00:36.160
And you look like you swallow at games.

01:00:36.160 --> 01:00:37.160
You're nasty.

01:00:37.160 --> 01:00:38.160
Thanks for the fives.

01:00:38.160 --> 01:00:39.160
Going to a rent.

01:00:40.160 --> 01:00:42.160
Don't know what's going on, but I like it.

01:00:42.160 --> 01:00:43.160
Yes.

01:00:44.160 --> 01:00:46.160
As long as you're enjoying yourself.

01:00:46.160 --> 01:00:50.160
What a lovely freaking chat she's got already.

01:00:50.160 --> 01:00:53.160
Although her design is like, oh, wow.

01:00:53.160 --> 01:00:54.160
Wow, this takes me back.

01:00:54.160 --> 01:00:57.160
This site should be the one.

01:00:57.160 --> 01:00:58.160
Wait, huh?

01:00:59.160 --> 01:01:00.160
Don't TOS yourself.

01:01:00.160 --> 01:01:01.160
Don't TOS.

01:01:01.160 --> 01:01:02.160
What are you opening?

01:01:02.160 --> 01:01:03.160
Are you all right?

01:01:03.160 --> 01:01:04.160
What's wrong?

01:01:05.160 --> 01:01:08.160
Oh, it's so old that support has ended and we can't play.

01:01:08.160 --> 01:01:12.160
Girl, you're supposed to pre-open the game before stream for this reason.

01:01:13.160 --> 01:01:15.160
Of course, literally.

01:01:17.160 --> 01:01:20.160
That's actually in one of my rule books for the girls.

01:01:20.160 --> 01:01:22.160
I gave them a document and it said,

01:01:22.160 --> 01:01:25.160
please open the game before stream to make sure you know it works

01:01:25.160 --> 01:01:27.160
and have backup games immediately.

01:01:27.160 --> 01:01:29.160
Yep, there is folks.

01:01:29.160 --> 01:01:30.160
No, that was rude, I think.

01:01:30.160 --> 01:01:31.160
You're so silly.

01:01:31.160 --> 01:01:32.160
That's cute.

01:01:33.160 --> 01:01:34.160
Lol, this is...

01:01:34.160 --> 01:01:36.160
This was more interesting, actually.

01:01:36.160 --> 01:01:37.160
Okay, okay.

01:01:38.160 --> 01:01:41.160
Literally in the document, I'm like, please open.

01:01:41.160 --> 01:01:42.160
I'm like, don't cry.

01:01:43.160 --> 01:01:45.160
Stop pandering to the old fucks on the internet.

01:01:47.160 --> 01:01:48.160
Are we ages out here?

01:01:48.160 --> 01:01:49.160
Hold on a minute.

01:01:50.160 --> 01:01:51.160
I'm not.

01:01:51.160 --> 01:01:52.160
You're not reading that.

01:01:52.160 --> 01:01:53.160
That's not nice.

01:01:56.160 --> 01:01:57.160
That's not nice.

01:01:57.160 --> 01:02:00.160
Or should I put it in there and then she'll address it?

01:02:00.160 --> 01:02:01.160
Possibly.

01:02:01.160 --> 01:02:03.160
I'll put it in so she addresses it and she's like,

01:02:03.160 --> 01:02:05.160
we're not ages out here.

01:02:05.160 --> 01:02:07.160
We're just here having a good time, you know what I'm saying?

01:02:07.160 --> 01:02:08.160
It's okay, there's always next time.

01:02:08.160 --> 01:02:10.160
You're lucky you're so pretty.

01:02:10.160 --> 01:02:11.160
You're lucky?

01:02:11.160 --> 01:02:12.160
No.

01:02:12.160 --> 01:02:14.160
Yeah, you spawned in, okay?

01:02:14.160 --> 01:02:15.160
You didn't pick the coordinates.

01:02:15.160 --> 01:02:16.160
You didn't pick what's going on.

01:02:16.160 --> 01:02:18.160
Alright, maybe I shouldn't have done that one.

01:02:20.160 --> 01:02:21.160
Oh, I don't know.

01:02:21.160 --> 01:02:22.160
Don't cry.

01:02:24.160 --> 01:02:26.160
There are only three situations

01:02:26.160 --> 01:02:28.160
where it is appropriate for a woman to cry.

01:02:30.160 --> 01:02:31.160
Alright.

01:02:31.160 --> 01:02:34.160
When you get dumped, when you lose your wallet,

01:02:34.160 --> 01:02:37.160
and when your childhood flash games get discontinued.

01:02:39.160 --> 01:02:41.160
Sorry, I've got warrable if you can hear me rubbing that.

01:02:41.160 --> 01:02:44.160
Stop entering to the old folks on the internet.

01:02:45.160 --> 01:02:47.160
Shut up, I love all of this.

01:02:47.160 --> 01:02:48.160
That's a cool way.

01:02:48.160 --> 01:02:50.160
Doesn't matter what age and gender.

01:02:50.160 --> 01:02:51.160
Okay, yeah, she's sure I'm done.

01:02:51.160 --> 01:02:53.160
That's what I'm talking about.

01:02:54.160 --> 01:02:56.160
So much for our first game stream.

01:02:56.160 --> 01:02:58.160
That's all for today, I guess.

01:02:58.160 --> 01:02:59.160
Blaze.

01:02:59.160 --> 01:03:02.160
Welcome to the house of Blaze.

01:03:02.160 --> 01:03:03.160
Okay.

01:03:10.160 --> 01:03:11.160
Well, that's it.

01:03:11.160 --> 01:03:12.160
What can you do?

01:03:12.160 --> 01:03:14.160
Things are only just getting started,

01:03:14.160 --> 01:03:17.160
so I have to try even harder from now.

01:03:17.160 --> 01:03:19.160
Come on, I said stop ignoring me.

01:03:19.160 --> 01:03:22.160
I'm 500 times more needed.

01:03:22.160 --> 01:03:25.160
Can I like like these so she knows I'm not ignoring her?

01:03:26.160 --> 01:03:27.160
I don't know.

01:03:27.160 --> 01:03:29.160
My fiction 50.

01:03:29.160 --> 01:03:31.160
Our stress is so high.

01:03:32.160 --> 01:03:34.160
We need to do something about that.

01:03:34.160 --> 01:03:37.160
We need to do something about our stress today.

01:03:37.160 --> 01:03:38.160
I'm getting nervous.

01:03:38.160 --> 01:03:39.160
I'm getting shaky.

01:03:39.160 --> 01:03:40.160
Right.

01:03:40.160 --> 01:03:43.160
For your stress, go and...

01:03:45.160 --> 01:03:47.160
Our stress goes way down.

01:03:50.160 --> 01:03:52.160
And the fiction goes way up.

01:03:52.160 --> 01:03:56.160
But the thing is, the stress goes down by like...

01:03:56.160 --> 01:03:58.160
What number of difference is that?

01:03:58.160 --> 01:03:59.160
Eight.

01:03:59.160 --> 01:04:03.160
Whereas the stress goes down by six on that one.

01:04:03.160 --> 01:04:04.160
I'm sorry, but a wee...

01:04:04.160 --> 01:04:05.160
Oh wait, I need to talk to her.

01:04:05.160 --> 01:04:06.160
Sorry.

01:04:06.160 --> 01:04:07.160
My new microphone's here.

01:04:07.160 --> 01:04:08.160
People have been calling about the sense.

01:04:08.160 --> 01:04:09.160
So this is really good.

01:04:09.160 --> 01:04:12.160
Maybe I should take it with me to karaoke.

01:04:13.160 --> 01:04:15.160
Oh my God, yeah, I wanna hear you sing, baby girl.

01:04:17.160 --> 01:04:18.160
It's lovely time.

01:04:19.160 --> 01:04:20.160
Oh my God, you're so cute.

01:04:21.160 --> 01:04:22.160
I'm dead.

01:04:22.160 --> 01:04:23.160
This is so cute.

01:04:25.160 --> 01:04:26.160
We'll be together in our next...

01:04:27.160 --> 01:04:28.160
Oh, are we doing afterlife?

01:04:29.160 --> 01:04:31.160
Yeah, yeah, together in our afterlife.

01:04:31.160 --> 01:04:32.160
You believe in that stuff?

01:04:34.160 --> 01:04:35.160
Okay, right.

01:04:35.160 --> 01:04:36.160
To bed you go.

01:04:36.160 --> 01:04:37.160
Go do your thing, baby girl.

01:04:38.160 --> 01:04:39.160
Let's get that stress level done.

01:04:39.160 --> 01:04:40.160
Cause I'm getting nervous.

01:04:40.160 --> 01:04:41.160
I'm getting shaky.

01:04:45.160 --> 01:04:46.160
Wow, some...

01:04:46.160 --> 01:04:49.160
What's something you guys are really into these days?

01:04:49.160 --> 01:04:50.160
Minus.

01:04:51.160 --> 01:04:52.160
I love everything about...

01:04:54.160 --> 01:04:58.160
I feel like my brain's gonna leak out of my head from how good it feels.

01:04:58.160 --> 01:04:59.160
I wanna have...

01:05:00.160 --> 01:05:01.160
Right, we're at night.

01:05:01.160 --> 01:05:02.160
Wait, we're at night already?

01:05:02.160 --> 01:05:03.160
Oh, for goodness sake.

01:05:04.160 --> 01:05:08.160
One day we'll be one of those couples that can afford to call a taxi to go wherever we want.

01:05:08.160 --> 01:05:09.160
That is so specific.

01:05:12.160 --> 01:05:14.160
Yeah, oh my God, I would love that.

01:05:16.160 --> 01:05:18.160
I'm afraid you need to stream.

01:05:19.160 --> 01:05:21.160
But her stress is so high.

01:05:23.160 --> 01:05:24.160
And I never even got her to get a new...

01:05:35.160 --> 01:05:36.160
I never got...

01:05:37.160 --> 01:05:38.160
Are you sure you want to proceed?

01:05:38.160 --> 01:05:40.160
You'll miss out on streaming at night, but I can't.

01:05:41.160 --> 01:05:42.160
I'm out of idea.

01:05:42.160 --> 01:05:45.160
Wait, she actually can't just do a zatsu off the top of her head.

01:05:49.160 --> 01:05:52.160
Wait, what am I supposed to do? Am I to send her to bed?

01:05:52.160 --> 01:05:53.160
What's going on?

01:05:55.160 --> 01:05:56.160
I already forgot what I told her to do.

01:05:56.160 --> 01:05:57.160
Is she doing something?

01:05:57.160 --> 01:05:58.160
Hold on, Danny.

01:06:00.160 --> 01:06:01.160
What are you...

01:06:01.160 --> 01:06:02.160
What are you doing?

01:06:03.160 --> 01:06:05.160
Are you doing something?

01:06:06.160 --> 01:06:08.160
Is she doing something?

01:06:09.160 --> 01:06:10.160
You can give her head pads.

01:06:10.160 --> 01:06:11.160
Okay.

01:06:11.160 --> 01:06:12.160
Oh, wow, I didn't know that.

01:06:12.160 --> 01:06:13.160
What on earth?

01:06:18.160 --> 01:06:19.160
I'm kind of tired.

01:06:19.160 --> 01:06:21.160
Thanks for always being so nice to me.

01:06:21.160 --> 01:06:22.160
Yeah.

01:06:23.160 --> 01:06:28.160
I should carry on your spirit and be nice to my little nerds every once in a while.

01:06:29.160 --> 01:06:30.160
Okay.

01:06:31.160 --> 01:06:33.160
How do I reduce your stress?

01:06:36.160 --> 01:06:37.160
Sexy stream.

01:06:37.160 --> 01:06:39.160
Her first ASMR stream.

01:06:40.160 --> 01:06:41.160
Let's go.

01:06:42.160 --> 01:06:43.160
Go two to one.

01:06:43.160 --> 01:06:45.160
So we can't do anything because we're, like, out of time.

01:06:47.160 --> 01:06:50.160
Can I, like, head pat her until, like, some of the stats go down?

01:06:52.160 --> 01:06:53.160
I think she was doing something sexy.

01:06:53.160 --> 01:06:55.160
Honestly, I was like, what's going on?

01:06:55.160 --> 01:06:56.160
Oh, we're on day seven.

01:06:56.160 --> 01:06:57.160
Rent's due soon.

01:06:58.160 --> 01:07:00.160
Hey, what color should I paint my nails?

01:07:00.160 --> 01:07:02.160
Light blue, purple, rainbow, black.

01:07:03.160 --> 01:07:08.160
I want to say purple because of her hair streaks and her alternative outfit.

01:07:09.160 --> 01:07:13.160
Light blue and red for her actual natural self, though.

01:07:18.160 --> 01:07:20.160
Light blue matches her natural self more.

01:07:20.160 --> 01:07:24.160
I know black is, like, the thing, but she is going to have to dress up for her stream.

01:07:25.160 --> 01:07:27.160
Aw, she's actually doing as I say.

01:07:28.160 --> 01:07:29.160
You're actually such a good girl.

01:07:29.160 --> 01:07:30.160
You're so clever.

01:07:31.160 --> 01:07:32.160
Good girl.

01:07:34.160 --> 01:07:35.160
I did my nails.

01:07:35.160 --> 01:07:36.160
Aren't they pretty?

01:07:36.160 --> 01:07:37.160
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:07:37.160 --> 01:07:38.160
Yeah, that's what I was thinking.

01:07:38.160 --> 01:07:39.160
Like, it kind of matches.

01:07:40.160 --> 01:07:42.160
Jake, it's not even me that likes the color.

01:07:44.160 --> 01:07:45.160
Well, I knew black.

01:07:46.160 --> 01:07:47.160
Found a new girl.

01:07:47.160 --> 01:07:48.160
I like more than you.

01:07:48.160 --> 01:07:50.160
I mean, yeah, you get new Oshis all the time.

01:07:50.160 --> 01:07:51.160
You're allowed a new Oshie.

01:07:51.160 --> 01:07:52.160
You don't have to say it.

01:07:52.160 --> 01:07:53.160
I've allowed, though.

01:07:54.160 --> 01:07:55.160
You know, some...

01:07:55.160 --> 01:07:56.160
Right.

01:07:56.160 --> 01:07:57.160
Stress?

01:07:57.160 --> 01:07:58.160
Oh, forget the sleep.

01:08:00.160 --> 01:08:02.160
If she sleeps, sleep until tomorrow.

01:08:02.160 --> 01:08:04.160
A new idea if I sleep until tomorrow.

01:08:05.160 --> 01:08:06.160
Aw.

01:08:08.160 --> 01:08:09.160
Okay.

01:08:09.160 --> 01:08:10.160
I'm just going to send her a bed.

01:08:10.160 --> 01:08:12.160
We have an ASMR stream planned for tonight.

01:08:12.160 --> 01:08:13.160
She's going to sleep.

01:08:13.160 --> 01:08:14.160
Okay.

01:08:14.160 --> 01:08:15.160
She's going to sleep.

01:08:15.160 --> 01:08:16.160
Let her sleep.

01:08:16.160 --> 01:08:17.160
Right.

01:08:17.160 --> 01:08:18.160
ASMR time.

01:08:18.160 --> 01:08:19.160
Get the mic out.

01:08:19.160 --> 01:08:21.160
Get licking it, young lady.

01:08:21.160 --> 01:08:22.160
Okay.

01:08:22.160 --> 01:08:24.160
Did I make myself clear?

01:08:24.160 --> 01:08:25.160
I want to get ha...

01:08:25.160 --> 01:08:26.160
Oh.

01:08:26.160 --> 01:08:27.160
I don't think we...

01:08:27.160 --> 01:08:29.160
I don't think we're allowed to condone that.

01:08:29.160 --> 01:08:31.160
Sorry, but no, you're about to do an ASMR stream.

01:08:31.160 --> 01:08:34.160
And we need to make sure it's YouTube terms of service safe.

01:08:34.160 --> 01:08:35.160
Okay?

01:08:35.160 --> 01:08:37.160
So, no, you're not allowed.

01:08:37.160 --> 01:08:39.160
Go do ASMR.

01:08:39.160 --> 01:08:40.160
Right now.

01:08:43.160 --> 01:08:44.160
Hold on.

01:08:44.160 --> 01:08:47.160
I'm going to reach for a water ball from yesterday.

01:08:47.160 --> 01:08:49.160
Because I forgot to get a new water ball.

01:08:53.160 --> 01:08:54.160
Sub-squibble.

01:08:55.160 --> 01:08:56.160
Any sub-squibblers?

01:08:56.160 --> 01:08:57.160
First time.

01:08:58.160 --> 01:08:59.160
Hi, cuties.

01:08:59.160 --> 01:09:02.160
I hope all of you nerds are going through it today, too.

01:09:02.160 --> 01:09:03.160
Going through it?

01:09:04.160 --> 01:09:05.160
Like...

01:09:05.160 --> 01:09:08.160
The Mr. K is the always best.

01:09:09.160 --> 01:09:11.160
I want to die!

01:09:11.160 --> 01:09:12.160
Whoa!

01:09:13.160 --> 01:09:15.160
I don't think I can allow that.

01:09:15.160 --> 01:09:17.160
Sorry, I put my hand over my mouth in shock.

01:09:17.160 --> 01:09:19.160
Because I didn't want to...

01:09:19.160 --> 01:09:20.160
Like, to...

01:09:20.160 --> 01:09:21.160
I'm not a nerd.

01:09:21.160 --> 01:09:22.160
But...

01:09:22.160 --> 01:09:23.160
But...

01:09:23.160 --> 01:09:24.160
But...

01:09:25.160 --> 01:09:26.160
So much...

01:09:26.160 --> 01:09:28.160
Die show food.

01:09:29.160 --> 01:09:32.160
You're also good for always trying so hard.

01:09:32.160 --> 01:09:34.160
It's okay if you're chocolate-er.

01:09:34.160 --> 01:09:36.160
You can lie to someone.

01:09:36.160 --> 01:09:38.160
Honestly, I'm starting to agree with her.

01:09:38.160 --> 01:09:39.160
Hold on a minute.

01:09:39.160 --> 01:09:41.160
She's actually kind of starting to make sense.

01:09:41.160 --> 01:09:44.160
Like, sorry, but you actually have been told by the capitalist cogs

01:09:44.160 --> 01:09:46.160
that you need to be productive for every...

01:09:46.160 --> 01:09:48.160
Here comes the most jobless of them all.

01:09:48.160 --> 01:09:49.160
Eh!

01:09:49.160 --> 01:09:51.160
You have been told that you need to be productive

01:09:51.160 --> 01:09:52.160
for every second of your life.

01:09:52.160 --> 01:09:53.160
That's not true.

01:09:53.160 --> 01:09:57.160
You try harder than any of us.

01:09:59.160 --> 01:10:01.160
But personally, I hate being told

01:10:01.160 --> 01:10:03.160
that just being alive is enough.

01:10:03.160 --> 01:10:04.160
Eh!

01:10:04.160 --> 01:10:06.160
It's just such an empty-ass compliment.

01:10:06.160 --> 01:10:07.160
No!

01:10:07.160 --> 01:10:08.160
Sorry, I'm disagreeing.

01:10:08.160 --> 01:10:09.160
Hold on a minute.

01:10:09.160 --> 01:10:12.160
K Angel, you're starting to lose it.

01:10:12.160 --> 01:10:14.160
Get back on the politician bandwagon.

01:10:14.160 --> 01:10:16.160
I want you to take over Earth right now.

01:10:16.160 --> 01:10:17.160
I feel that.

01:10:17.160 --> 01:10:18.160
Tell him.

01:10:18.160 --> 01:10:19.160
I feel worse now.

01:10:19.160 --> 01:10:20.160
Uh, not for...

01:10:20.160 --> 01:10:22.160
I feel like that's cathartic.

01:10:22.160 --> 01:10:23.160
Is it cathartic?

01:10:23.160 --> 01:10:27.160
If someone, like, kind of just gets to vent and chat?

01:10:27.160 --> 01:10:30.160
I feel like that'll put her stress up, though.

01:10:30.160 --> 01:10:32.160
But it's, like, cathartic to, like, put it out there

01:10:32.160 --> 01:10:33.160
to be like, you know what?

01:10:33.160 --> 01:10:35.160
I'm feeling it!

01:10:35.160 --> 01:10:36.160
You know?

01:10:36.160 --> 01:10:38.160
I have a really good pick-me-up for you guys today.

01:10:38.160 --> 01:10:40.160
ASMR!

01:10:40.160 --> 01:10:41.160
Here we go.

01:10:41.160 --> 01:10:42.160
What is it?

01:10:43.160 --> 01:10:44.160
Yo!

01:10:45.160 --> 01:10:47.160
I'll be your team yell.

01:10:48.160 --> 01:10:50.160
I'll be your team yell.

01:10:54.160 --> 01:10:55.160
Smooch!

01:10:56.160 --> 01:10:57.160
Smooch!

01:10:57.160 --> 01:10:58.160
Is that what I'm supposed to say?

01:10:58.160 --> 01:11:00.160
I don't know if I'm supposed to go muah or smooch.

01:11:00.160 --> 01:11:03.160
You're my real life Angel.

01:11:07.160 --> 01:11:08.160
Love you.

01:11:09.160 --> 01:11:11.160
I've always wanted to try that.

01:11:11.160 --> 01:11:14.160
But now that I have, I'm so embarrassed I could die.

01:11:14.160 --> 01:11:16.160
May I stop keeping going?

01:11:16.160 --> 01:11:18.160
No, I'm not going to stop.

01:11:20.160 --> 01:11:21.160
I need to stop.

01:11:21.160 --> 01:11:22.160
I need to stop.

01:11:22.160 --> 01:11:23.160
Can you take it off?

01:11:26.160 --> 01:11:27.160
Yeah, we're gonna...

01:11:28.160 --> 01:11:29.160
I'll give it an A+.

01:11:29.160 --> 01:11:30.160
My first kiss.

01:11:32.160 --> 01:11:33.160
I'm so happy.

01:11:34.160 --> 01:11:35.160
Then die.

01:11:39.160 --> 01:11:41.160
Thank you for the tip.

01:11:41.160 --> 01:11:43.160
But no, I'm not gonna...

01:11:43.160 --> 01:11:45.160
This pandering feels forced.

01:11:45.160 --> 01:11:46.160
It's weird.

01:11:46.160 --> 01:11:48.160
Is that gonna stress her out?

01:11:52.160 --> 01:11:55.160
I think because we know she's role-playing, it will.

01:11:55.160 --> 01:11:56.160
Thank you for the tip.

01:11:56.160 --> 01:11:58.160
Okay, that's much nicer.

01:11:59.160 --> 01:12:01.160
I don't want her to get stressed out

01:12:01.160 --> 01:12:05.160
because I'm already struggling with her stress at the moment.

01:12:05.160 --> 01:12:07.160
She looks like Monka.

01:12:08.160 --> 01:12:09.160
Do it again, please.

01:12:09.160 --> 01:12:10.160
You're too cute.

01:12:11.160 --> 01:12:12.160
Yes.

01:12:12.160 --> 01:12:13.160
Ratchets in a way.

01:12:13.160 --> 01:12:14.160
I don't know if we're gonna make rent.

01:12:14.160 --> 01:12:16.160
I'm gonna make you my girlfriend.

01:12:21.160 --> 01:12:22.160
This is...

01:12:22.160 --> 01:12:25.160
I always send the girls these little symbols

01:12:25.160 --> 01:12:27.160
all the time in my messages.

01:12:27.160 --> 01:12:29.160
And they're just surrounding me.

01:12:31.160 --> 01:12:32.160
Love.

01:12:32.160 --> 01:12:33.160
Love.

01:12:33.160 --> 01:12:35.160
Love and thank you for the super chat, too.

01:12:35.160 --> 01:12:38.160
I love a man who can send me both love and money.

01:12:38.160 --> 01:12:39.160
Love and money.

01:12:40.160 --> 01:12:42.160
And thank you kiss for you.

01:12:42.160 --> 01:12:44.160
And I'll thank you kiss for you more.

01:12:44.160 --> 01:12:45.160
Thanks.

01:12:45.160 --> 01:12:46.160
Please go down.

01:12:52.160 --> 01:12:54.160
Why did you say that?

01:12:54.160 --> 01:12:56.160
Are you squidding me right now?

01:12:56.160 --> 01:12:57.160
Why did you say that?

01:12:58.160 --> 01:13:01.160
Beryl, I thank you kiss for you more.

01:13:02.160 --> 01:13:05.160
Why did she say that at the end of the stream?

01:13:06.160 --> 01:13:09.160
Why did you say go die at the end of a super chat?

01:13:12.160 --> 01:13:13.160
What?

01:13:14.160 --> 01:13:17.160
I was so confused why she randomly came over that.

01:13:17.160 --> 01:13:18.160
Did you see her?

01:13:18.160 --> 01:13:20.160
Hey, did you all like what you saw the date?

01:13:20.160 --> 01:13:22.160
If you did, let's play again tomorrow.

01:13:23.160 --> 01:13:26.160
Did some basic ass pandering in my stats or skyroll?

01:13:27.160 --> 01:13:28.160
Oh, wow.

01:13:28.160 --> 01:13:29.160
I actually did.

01:13:29.160 --> 01:13:32.160
Oh, her stress is so high after that.

01:13:33.160 --> 01:13:36.160
But the longest way around is the shortest way home, right?

01:13:36.160 --> 01:13:38.160
I can't just ignore the groves.

01:13:39.160 --> 01:13:40.160
One new Twitter.

01:13:40.160 --> 01:13:41.160
I missed it.

01:13:41.160 --> 01:13:42.160
You guys are having...

01:13:42.160 --> 01:13:44.160
You guys are having a really tough time in life.

01:13:44.160 --> 01:13:46.160
When you're in life, things are doing overwhelming.

01:13:46.160 --> 01:13:47.160
But shut up, everyone.

01:13:47.160 --> 01:13:49.160
As long as you're not falling forward,

01:13:49.160 --> 01:13:51.160
you'll find me waiting for you on the internet.

01:13:52.160 --> 01:13:53.160
Is that the end?

01:13:53.160 --> 01:13:54.160
Do you need a head part?

01:13:57.160 --> 01:14:00.160
Is there a secret to the stress level thing?

01:14:00.160 --> 01:14:03.160
I think I'm not achieving whatever it is.

01:14:03.160 --> 01:14:05.160
I don't want her to break.

01:14:07.160 --> 01:14:08.160
I reached 10.

01:14:08.160 --> 01:14:09.160
I want to do a celebration stream,

01:14:09.160 --> 01:14:10.160
but you know, 10k is a nice number,

01:14:10.160 --> 01:14:11.160
but that's about it.

01:14:11.160 --> 01:14:12.160
Yeah, go for it.

01:14:12.160 --> 01:14:13.160
It's very...

01:14:13.160 --> 01:14:16.160
I was actually speaking to the girls about this.

01:14:16.160 --> 01:14:18.160
The first step I'm taking is a legendary angel,

01:14:18.160 --> 01:14:20.160
but I'm going to get everyone to celebrate it.

01:14:20.160 --> 01:14:21.160
No takes back.

01:14:21.160 --> 01:14:22.160
You will love me for...

01:14:22.160 --> 01:14:23.160
I don't know about you, Andrea.

01:14:26.160 --> 01:14:27.160
You have a new idea.

01:14:27.160 --> 01:14:28.160
Internet Angel, the internet and me.

01:14:28.160 --> 01:14:29.160
Thanks for 10k.

01:14:29.160 --> 01:14:30.160
Okay.

01:14:30.160 --> 01:14:31.160
That happened naturally,

01:14:31.160 --> 01:14:33.160
so I can fully de-stress her today

01:14:33.160 --> 01:14:35.160
without needing to come up with ideas.

01:14:35.160 --> 01:14:37.160
Wait, she's going to get an idea

01:14:37.160 --> 01:14:39.160
if I do this to her?

01:14:41.160 --> 01:14:43.160
It drops her...

01:14:43.160 --> 01:14:45.160
Wait, what does this do?

01:14:45.160 --> 01:14:47.160
Wait, two gaming...

01:14:47.160 --> 01:14:50.160
Oh, but she gets a new idea if I do this.

01:14:50.160 --> 01:14:53.160
I don't know what the thing is, though.

01:14:53.160 --> 01:14:55.160
Rest and touching grass,

01:14:55.160 --> 01:14:56.160
like a real streamer stress management.

01:14:56.160 --> 01:14:58.160
Literally, we need to take her out

01:14:58.160 --> 01:14:59.160
and go meet Gami.

01:14:59.160 --> 01:15:00.160
So when she meets Gami,

01:15:00.160 --> 01:15:02.160
things just even out, you know?

01:15:02.160 --> 01:15:04.160
Thank God they didn't introduce you

01:15:04.160 --> 01:15:06.160
to demonetising.

01:15:06.160 --> 01:15:08.160
I'm not even monetised yet.

01:15:08.160 --> 01:15:09.160
They won't update my stats,

01:15:09.160 --> 01:15:11.160
so I can't even get my stats.

01:15:11.160 --> 01:15:12.160
She gets a new stream idea

01:15:12.160 --> 01:15:14.160
if I do this, though.

01:15:14.160 --> 01:15:17.160
And she doesn't, if we do play stress

01:15:17.160 --> 01:15:20.160
and things, internet.

01:15:20.160 --> 01:15:24.160
Her stress goes up exponentially.

01:15:24.160 --> 01:15:27.160
Mental darkness.

01:15:27.160 --> 01:15:29.160
Cine...

01:15:29.160 --> 01:15:30.160
Video streaming.

01:15:30.160 --> 01:15:32.160
Watch a movie.

01:15:32.160 --> 01:15:34.160
It takes her to dust.

01:15:34.160 --> 01:15:35.160
You know what?

01:15:35.160 --> 01:15:37.160
She's not actually sat and watched something.

01:15:37.160 --> 01:15:39.160
Oh, no, she's crying!

01:15:39.160 --> 01:15:40.160
Wait, you didn't want to watch that?

01:15:40.160 --> 01:15:41.160
I'm sorry.

01:15:41.160 --> 01:15:43.160
Were we supposed to do something?

01:15:43.160 --> 01:15:44.160
Oops.

01:15:44.160 --> 01:15:45.160
I think so, didn't I?

01:15:45.160 --> 01:15:47.160
I keep looking up there.

01:15:47.160 --> 01:15:49.160
I'm rattling the channel page

01:15:49.160 --> 01:15:51.160
for the prison door screen monetised story.

01:15:51.160 --> 01:15:53.160
They just won't update the stats.

01:15:53.160 --> 01:15:54.160
I don't know why.

01:15:54.160 --> 01:15:56.160
The streaming site I use updated.

01:15:56.160 --> 01:15:58.160
I've got, like, idle anime, truly.

01:15:58.160 --> 01:16:02.160
And the best ones are the kids' idle anime.

01:16:02.160 --> 01:16:03.160
It's not idle.

01:16:03.160 --> 01:16:05.160
I'm glad you love it.

01:16:05.160 --> 01:16:07.160
Well, I guess that's why the page on the TV

01:16:07.160 --> 01:16:08.160
is my best though.

01:16:08.160 --> 01:16:09.160
Right!

01:16:09.160 --> 01:16:10.160
For any TV shows,

01:16:10.160 --> 01:16:11.160
really good inspiration for my streams.

01:16:11.160 --> 01:16:13.160
If there's anything you guys would like me to do,

01:16:13.160 --> 01:16:14.160
let me know in the replies

01:16:14.160 --> 01:16:15.160
and maybe I could do something

01:16:15.160 --> 01:16:18.160
that we could always have somewhere.

01:16:18.160 --> 01:16:22.160
A girl's idle journey in a kid's anime.

01:16:22.160 --> 01:16:23.160
Okay, okay, okay.

01:16:23.160 --> 01:16:24.160
Shake a prompt.

01:16:24.160 --> 01:16:29.160
Uh, stress is still faking high.

01:16:29.160 --> 01:16:32.160
Mmm.

01:16:32.160 --> 01:16:33.160
I'll miss...

01:16:33.160 --> 01:16:36.160
Yeah, I'll miss stream if I do that.

01:16:36.160 --> 01:16:38.160
Is there an internet?

01:16:38.160 --> 01:16:40.160
It only puts it down by four,

01:16:40.160 --> 01:16:42.160
but it gives her another...

01:16:42.160 --> 01:16:44.160
This doesn't do anything?

01:16:44.160 --> 01:16:46.160
I don't know, it's dindered.

01:16:46.160 --> 01:16:48.160
I don't know why.

01:16:48.160 --> 01:16:50.160
That puts her stress down by four

01:16:50.160 --> 01:16:53.160
and gives her a new news stream idea.

01:16:54.160 --> 01:16:56.160
That takes her to the next date.

01:16:56.160 --> 01:16:57.160
No, I think we're just going to have

01:16:57.160 --> 01:16:58.160
to do spend time together

01:16:58.160 --> 01:16:59.160
and put affection up.

01:16:59.160 --> 01:17:00.160
Oh, sorry, I'm sorry.

01:17:00.160 --> 01:17:01.160
Apparently with this credit card thing,

01:17:01.160 --> 01:17:02.160
we can...

01:17:02.160 --> 01:17:03.160
No!

01:17:03.160 --> 01:17:04.160
No!

01:17:04.160 --> 01:17:05.160
No!

01:17:05.160 --> 01:17:06.160
No!

01:17:06.160 --> 01:17:07.160
Credit cards are bad.

01:17:07.160 --> 01:17:08.160
They're not real credit...

01:17:08.160 --> 01:17:09.160
No!

01:17:09.160 --> 01:17:10.160
Don't...

01:17:10.160 --> 01:17:11.160
I'll punch you.

01:17:11.160 --> 01:17:12.160
I don't care,

01:17:12.160 --> 01:17:13.160
you can beat me up

01:17:13.160 --> 01:17:14.160
and spit in my mouth.

01:17:14.160 --> 01:17:15.160
Do whatever you want.

01:17:15.160 --> 01:17:16.160
You will not know peace.

01:17:16.160 --> 01:17:17.160
Oh my God,

01:17:17.160 --> 01:17:18.160
this is literally what I'm asking for.

01:17:18.160 --> 01:17:19.160
I love it.

01:17:19.160 --> 01:17:20.160
I love you so much.

01:17:20.160 --> 01:17:21.160
Oh my God,

01:17:21.160 --> 01:17:22.160
you just read my mind?

01:17:22.160 --> 01:17:23.160
Oh, it says read when she reads it.

01:17:23.160 --> 01:17:25.160
Oh, that's kind of scary, actually.

01:17:25.160 --> 01:17:26.160
Right, what?

01:17:27.160 --> 01:17:28.160
Wait, what is this?

01:17:30.160 --> 01:17:32.160
Affection goes up during game.

01:17:32.160 --> 01:17:34.160
Game or girl goes up.

01:17:34.160 --> 01:17:36.160
But experience goes up.

01:17:36.160 --> 01:17:38.160
Ah, maybe...

01:17:38.160 --> 01:17:40.160
Does make stress 67s better.

01:17:42.160 --> 01:17:44.160
Are we going for the end ending?

01:17:44.160 --> 01:17:45.160
I don't know what endings there are.

01:17:45.160 --> 01:17:46.160
I've not played the game before.

01:17:46.160 --> 01:17:48.160
Click anywhere to give a head pat.

01:17:48.160 --> 01:17:49.160
More.

01:17:49.160 --> 01:17:50.160
Spend the whole day lasering.

01:17:50.160 --> 01:17:52.160
Oh wait, did I just skip stream?

01:17:54.160 --> 01:17:56.160
Oh, no.

01:17:56.160 --> 01:17:57.160
Maybe?

01:17:58.160 --> 01:17:59.160
No, no.

01:17:59.160 --> 01:18:00.160
It's time to stream.

01:18:00.160 --> 01:18:01.160
Okay, my apologies.

01:18:02.160 --> 01:18:05.160
Let's celebrate your 10k milestone,

01:18:05.160 --> 01:18:06.160
because that's fantastic.

01:18:06.160 --> 01:18:07.160
As I was saying before,

01:18:07.160 --> 01:18:09.160
I got interrupted by my own thoughts.

01:18:09.160 --> 01:18:11.160
I actually said to the girls,

01:18:11.160 --> 01:18:12.160
like, unfortunately,

01:18:12.160 --> 01:18:15.160
like, you kind of have to celebrate numbers

01:18:15.160 --> 01:18:16.160
as they come through

01:18:16.160 --> 01:18:18.160
to like make the tripper news or whatever.

01:18:18.160 --> 01:18:20.160
And like, it's really annoying.

01:18:20.160 --> 01:18:21.160
I don't like playing that game,

01:18:21.160 --> 01:18:23.160
but you do have to play that angle

01:18:23.160 --> 01:18:24.160
as a Vtuber,

01:18:24.160 --> 01:18:26.160
and it's like a bit like...

01:18:26.160 --> 01:18:27.160
I don't like it at all.

01:18:28.160 --> 01:18:29.160
You gotta do what you gotta do.

01:18:30.160 --> 01:18:31.160
Hi, here we go.

01:18:31.160 --> 01:18:32.160
Hey cuties, it's me,

01:18:32.160 --> 01:18:33.160
Angel...

01:18:33.160 --> 01:18:34.160
Wait.

01:18:34.160 --> 01:18:36.160
You're not reading comments for the stream.

01:18:36.160 --> 01:18:37.160
Hey cuties, it's me,

01:18:37.160 --> 01:18:38.160
Angel, Cypher, CypherSpace.

01:18:38.160 --> 01:18:41.160
You're crossing over my fingers.

01:18:41.160 --> 01:18:43.160
This stream is one to celebrate.

01:18:43.160 --> 01:18:44.160
Celebrate?

01:18:44.160 --> 01:18:45.160
What do you ask?

01:18:45.160 --> 01:18:47.160
Well, did you not read the title?

01:18:47.160 --> 01:18:49.160
Don't know how to make things for that game.

01:18:50.160 --> 01:18:52.160
I can't do anything actually.

01:18:53.160 --> 01:18:54.160
Um...

01:18:58.160 --> 01:19:00.160
Take your top off.

01:19:00.160 --> 01:19:01.160
Wait, I can't.

01:19:03.160 --> 01:19:05.160
This is nothing for you, I'm sure.

01:19:05.160 --> 01:19:07.160
I guess just skip ahead,

01:19:07.160 --> 01:19:08.160
honestly, because...

01:19:08.160 --> 01:19:09.160
no.

01:19:09.160 --> 01:19:10.160
That's right.

01:19:10.160 --> 01:19:11.160
Hi, King Angel!

01:19:11.160 --> 01:19:14.160
Have received 10,000 subscribers!

01:19:15.160 --> 01:19:16.160
You're such a...

01:19:16.160 --> 01:19:17.160
You could get away with...

01:19:17.160 --> 01:19:19.160
You could get way more subscribers.

01:19:19.160 --> 01:19:20.160
Oh, I can...

01:19:20.160 --> 01:19:21.160
I'm only gonna get bigger and bigger.

01:19:21.160 --> 01:19:23.160
I'm just gonna shine brighter than ever.

01:19:23.160 --> 01:19:24.160
Just watch.

01:19:24.160 --> 01:19:25.160
Everyone, subscribe.

01:19:25.160 --> 01:19:27.160
We need to blow...

01:19:27.160 --> 01:19:28.160
up.

01:19:28.160 --> 01:19:30.160
Celebrate with something tasty.

01:19:30.160 --> 01:19:32.160
Well, let's talk about the internet today.

01:19:32.160 --> 01:19:33.160
I bet you guys are...

01:19:33.160 --> 01:19:34.160
I can't read the path.

01:19:34.160 --> 01:19:35.160
You know, I really hated adults.

01:19:35.160 --> 01:19:36.160
They're all so fake.

01:19:36.160 --> 01:19:37.160
Adults?

01:19:37.160 --> 01:19:38.160
Girl, aren't you 18 plus?

01:19:39.160 --> 01:19:40.160
I'm getting nervous.

01:19:40.160 --> 01:19:41.160
Are you 18?

01:19:42.160 --> 01:19:43.160
I'm getting swayed.

01:19:43.160 --> 01:19:44.160
What's going on here?

01:19:44.160 --> 01:19:46.160
There's always a lot of adults on the internet,

01:19:46.160 --> 01:19:47.160
but they're all...

01:19:47.160 --> 01:19:49.160
But they were all true to themselves.

01:19:50.160 --> 01:19:52.160
Why do I find you being a dropout cute?

01:19:53.160 --> 01:19:54.160
Pat-pat-pats.

01:19:54.160 --> 01:19:57.160
They weren't ashamed of being into anime or manga.

01:19:57.160 --> 01:19:59.160
They were so free, so natural.

01:20:01.160 --> 01:20:02.160
I thought to myself,

01:20:02.160 --> 01:20:03.160
I want to live like that.

01:20:03.160 --> 01:20:06.160
I want to live on the internet and be my drizzle.

01:20:06.160 --> 01:20:07.160
I guess I wasn't too interested,

01:20:07.160 --> 01:20:09.160
but I'm glad I could share with you guys less.

01:20:09.160 --> 01:20:10.160
She said,

01:20:10.160 --> 01:20:12.160
you talk too fast for me when I put you on this mode.

01:20:12.160 --> 01:20:14.160
Jeez, the stream's already over.

01:20:14.160 --> 01:20:15.160
I'm gonna do a dang thing.

01:20:17.160 --> 01:20:19.160
Hello, you are all pure cinnamon world...

01:20:20.160 --> 01:20:21.160
Nerds.

01:20:21.160 --> 01:20:23.160
Thanks for celebrating 10k with me.

01:20:23.160 --> 01:20:24.160
I'm going to keep working so hard

01:20:24.160 --> 01:20:25.160
that everyone in the world knows my name.

01:20:25.160 --> 01:20:26.160
Please use that in a year's work.

01:20:29.160 --> 01:20:30.160
Look, I draw some fan art.

01:20:30.160 --> 01:20:32.160
Oh, that's so cool.

01:20:34.160 --> 01:20:36.160
That's so cool.

01:20:37.160 --> 01:20:39.160
Getting fan art is honestly crazy.

01:20:39.160 --> 01:20:40.160
I have to admit.

01:20:41.160 --> 01:20:43.160
Can I save it or send it to her

01:20:43.160 --> 01:20:45.160
so she can see it just so she knows?

01:20:50.160 --> 01:20:52.160
Oh, the night time trim is actually really nice.

01:20:52.160 --> 01:20:54.160
It reminds me of that Russian song

01:20:54.160 --> 01:20:57.160
that goes la la la la la la la la la la la la la.

01:20:58.160 --> 01:20:59.160
Best of me.

01:21:00.160 --> 01:21:01.160
She's 17!

01:21:03.160 --> 01:21:05.160
Am I ignoring her DMs again?

01:21:05.160 --> 01:21:07.160
How do I ignore them by accident?

01:21:07.160 --> 01:21:08.160
I'm sorry, I love you.

01:21:08.160 --> 01:21:09.160
I'm sorry.

01:21:11.160 --> 01:21:12.160
Can you get an achievement

01:21:12.160 --> 01:21:14.160
for clicking her head 100 times in a row?

01:21:19.160 --> 01:21:21.160
Okay, that's as fast as I can click.

01:21:21.160 --> 01:21:23.160
If I didn't make her happy, I wouldn't have won.

01:21:26.160 --> 01:21:27.160
I can hear that in the chat.

01:21:29.160 --> 01:21:31.160
Shit! Wait, she's actually 17.

01:21:35.160 --> 01:21:37.160
I very strongly think that any content creator

01:21:37.160 --> 01:21:39.160
should be at least 18 years old.

01:21:43.160 --> 01:21:45.160
Sponsorships, trying out new drinks?

01:21:45.160 --> 01:21:46.160
I got DM...

01:21:46.160 --> 01:21:47.160
Oh, sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

01:21:47.160 --> 01:21:48.160
Oh my god, that's amazing.

01:21:48.160 --> 01:21:49.160
Oh my god, love you.

01:21:49.160 --> 01:21:50.160
Oh my god, you're so cool.

01:21:50.160 --> 01:21:51.160
She's gonna know I haven't...

01:21:51.160 --> 01:21:52.160
Are you sure?

01:21:52.160 --> 01:21:53.160
Yeah!

01:21:53.160 --> 01:21:54.160
Yeah, this, I'm so sure.

01:21:56.160 --> 01:21:57.160
Wait, what did she ask?

01:21:57.160 --> 01:21:58.160
I don't pay attention.

01:21:59.160 --> 01:22:00.160
I got DM'd about sponsorship.

01:22:00.160 --> 01:22:02.160
Sponsorships, we're entering the big leagues.

01:22:02.160 --> 01:22:03.160
Let's see what it says.

01:22:03.160 --> 01:22:04.160
We'd like for you to review

01:22:04.160 --> 01:22:05.160
of our new...

01:22:06.160 --> 01:22:07.160
Natto?

01:22:07.160 --> 01:22:10.160
Wait, Natto is that fermented soybeans?

01:22:11.160 --> 01:22:12.160
Flavoured cola?

01:22:12.160 --> 01:22:14.160
And they said they'll pay me a year's supply.

01:22:15.160 --> 01:22:16.160
No!

01:22:17.160 --> 01:22:20.160
You have to accept US dollars for payment.

01:22:20.160 --> 01:22:24.160
You do not ever, ever entertain a sponsorship

01:22:24.160 --> 01:22:27.160
that say, we'll pay you with our product.

01:22:27.160 --> 01:22:28.160
No!

01:22:28.160 --> 01:22:31.160
Hard-earned, cold cash.

01:22:31.160 --> 01:22:35.160
Do not entertain, respond, reply.

01:22:35.160 --> 01:22:36.160
Okay?

01:22:36.160 --> 01:22:37.160
This is true.

01:22:37.160 --> 01:22:38.160
Yeah, why not?

01:22:38.160 --> 01:22:39.160
A job's a job.

01:22:39.160 --> 01:22:41.160
No, we are not doing that stream.

01:22:41.160 --> 01:22:43.160
Absolute waste of time.

01:22:43.160 --> 01:22:47.160
I'm going to send you to do that internet thing

01:22:47.160 --> 01:22:49.160
because I want you to become a politician.

01:22:49.160 --> 01:22:51.160
But her stress goes up.

01:22:55.160 --> 01:22:57.160
Her mental darkness goes up.

01:22:57.160 --> 01:22:59.160
But her stress goes down?

01:22:59.160 --> 01:23:01.160
No, her affection goes down.

01:23:03.160 --> 01:23:06.160
We will do...

01:23:06.160 --> 01:23:12.160
Is ST going to give me the fricking politician angle?

01:23:12.160 --> 01:23:14.160
I want her to take over the world.

01:23:16.160 --> 01:23:18.160
This takes me to dusk?

01:23:18.160 --> 01:23:20.160
Congrats on getting monetised.

01:23:20.160 --> 01:23:22.160
Why are they happy about that?

01:23:23.160 --> 01:23:26.160
So they can be her paper already down.

01:23:27.160 --> 01:23:28.160
Wait, what's this?

01:23:28.160 --> 01:23:30.160
This bottom book.

01:23:30.160 --> 01:23:31.160
POST!

01:23:31.160 --> 01:23:33.160
Oh no, her stress goes up.

01:23:33.160 --> 01:23:34.160
No, we ain't doing that.

01:23:34.160 --> 01:23:35.160
Your stress goes up.

01:23:35.160 --> 01:23:37.160
You go watch some cinema.

01:23:41.160 --> 01:23:43.160
I've been streaming a lot of anime by myself.

01:23:43.160 --> 01:23:46.160
Let me know in the replies if you have recommendations.

01:23:46.160 --> 01:23:48.160
Lying around and watching anime.

01:23:48.160 --> 01:23:49.160
Late...

01:23:49.160 --> 01:23:52.160
Late night anime is probably my favourite thing ever.

01:23:52.160 --> 01:23:53.160
Maybe I'll talk about conspir-

01:23:53.160 --> 01:23:55.160
YES!

01:23:55.160 --> 01:23:57.160
YES!

01:23:57.160 --> 01:23:58.160
Absolutely.

01:23:58.160 --> 01:23:59.160
Do it.

01:23:59.160 --> 01:24:00.160
But you know I'm a little scared to-

01:24:00.160 --> 01:24:02.160
No, keep talking about it.

01:24:02.160 --> 01:24:03.160
You're going to rule the world.

01:24:03.160 --> 01:24:05.160
You will rule the world.

01:24:05.160 --> 01:24:07.160
You must.

01:24:07.160 --> 01:24:08.160
You must.

01:24:08.160 --> 01:24:09.160
I don't think I have to do it.

01:24:09.160 --> 01:24:10.160
No, you have to do it.

01:24:10.160 --> 01:24:14.160
But I don't think I have to duel too much on that.

01:24:14.160 --> 01:24:20.160
Plus, I guess believing in them is kind of like its own brand of happiness.

01:24:20.160 --> 01:24:22.160
Please!

01:24:22.160 --> 01:24:26.160
But I think I'll talk about microchip snakes.

01:24:26.160 --> 01:24:27.160
Those are one of my favourites.

01:24:27.160 --> 01:24:28.160
YES!

01:24:28.160 --> 01:24:29.160
YES!

01:24:29.160 --> 01:24:31.160
Your PCs can scan the layout of your house.

01:24:31.160 --> 01:24:32.160
YES!

01:24:32.160 --> 01:24:34.160
I remember watching a talk show once in the sky.

01:24:34.160 --> 01:24:36.160
He was talking about an urban legend and another guest.

01:24:36.160 --> 01:24:38.160
It's like you got microchipped into you and then the guy was like,

01:24:38.160 --> 01:24:40.160
I could tell you but then I'd have to kill you.

01:24:40.160 --> 01:24:42.160
It was the most dead pan face ever.

01:24:42.160 --> 01:24:46.160
That was what made me look into this whole microchip business.

01:24:46.160 --> 01:24:51.160
In the first place, I guess I want to talk about it because of how plausible it is.

01:24:51.160 --> 01:24:52.160
YES!

01:24:52.160 --> 01:24:53.160
YES!

01:24:53.160 --> 01:24:54.160
YES!

01:24:54.160 --> 01:24:55.160
YES!

01:24:55.160 --> 01:24:56.160
YES!

01:24:56.160 --> 01:25:00.160
I want her to be like I'm a conspiracy nut.

01:25:00.160 --> 01:25:05.160
I've been falling asleep with my eyes open so if you see me doing that, please close

01:25:05.160 --> 01:25:06.160
your eyes.

01:25:06.160 --> 01:25:08.160
Please close my eyes for me.

01:25:08.160 --> 01:25:10.160
What the heck?

01:25:10.160 --> 01:25:12.160
Yeah, I will.

01:25:12.160 --> 01:25:13.160
Oh my god.

01:25:13.160 --> 01:25:19.160
Right, I'm just going to de-stress her because we already know what she's going to do.

01:25:19.160 --> 01:25:26.160
I put her stress up to post on social media which is such a shame.

01:25:26.160 --> 01:25:31.160
Video streaming seems like such a safe thing to make her less stressed.

01:25:31.160 --> 01:25:35.160
I'll do that and then we'll stream conspiracy theory.

01:25:35.160 --> 01:25:38.160
Oh tiny spiny, thank you for the tip.

01:25:38.160 --> 01:25:40.160
It's work time for me against Ronnie but enjoy the game.

01:25:40.160 --> 01:25:43.160
You'll probably all find I'm done but I'll catch up later.

01:25:43.160 --> 01:25:44.160
Yes, thank you so much.

01:25:44.160 --> 01:25:47.160
Unfortunately, it is a shorter stream but yes, have fun at work and thank you so very

01:25:47.160 --> 01:25:48.160
much for the kind tip.

01:25:48.160 --> 01:25:50.160
I appreciate it.

01:25:50.160 --> 01:25:54.160
I love videos where the person just talks about what they like even better if you learn

01:25:54.160 --> 01:25:55.160
something new from it.

01:25:55.160 --> 01:25:56.160
YES!

01:25:56.160 --> 01:25:57.160
Agreed.

01:25:57.160 --> 01:26:02.160
I may be dumb dumb with mental issues and a horrific academic record.

01:26:02.160 --> 01:26:04.160
Wait, hold on a minute.

01:26:04.160 --> 01:26:06.160
Hold on a minute.

01:26:06.160 --> 01:26:09.160
This is a henabit too close to home.

01:26:09.160 --> 01:26:13.160
But I still want to share all the things I've turned up researching these things.

01:26:13.160 --> 01:26:15.160
Wait, wait a minute.

01:26:15.160 --> 01:26:16.160
Hold on a minute.

01:26:16.160 --> 01:26:18.160
She wants to do education streams.

01:26:18.160 --> 01:26:20.160
Oh, wait a minute.

01:26:20.160 --> 01:26:23.160
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

01:26:23.160 --> 01:26:25.160
I'm getting mental Illinois.

01:26:25.160 --> 01:26:30.160
I'm going to do a stream talking about things I like and I like and my darling little nerds

01:26:30.160 --> 01:26:33.160
like and to do that, I guess I'll have to start at the very beginning with nerds themselves

01:26:33.160 --> 01:26:36.160
and I've already done plenty of research on them.

01:26:36.160 --> 01:26:38.160
Let's do it.

01:26:38.160 --> 01:26:39.160
Okay.

01:26:39.160 --> 01:26:40.160
Why are these?

01:26:40.160 --> 01:26:41.160
Oh my God.

01:26:41.160 --> 01:26:42.160
Yeah.

01:26:42.160 --> 01:26:44.160
You're so smart for coming up with these ideas baby girls.

01:26:44.160 --> 01:26:45.160
I can't even see you.

01:26:45.160 --> 01:26:46.160
Oh my God.

01:26:46.160 --> 01:26:47.160
You're so cute.

01:26:47.160 --> 01:26:48.160
Head pat.

01:26:48.160 --> 01:26:49.160
Head pat.

01:26:49.160 --> 01:26:50.160
Head pat.

01:26:50.160 --> 01:26:51.160
Right.

01:26:51.160 --> 01:26:52.160
Okay.

01:26:52.160 --> 01:27:00.160
Let's go to the night and the moment I get a single wrinkle, I think I'll end things.

01:27:00.160 --> 01:27:01.160
She's hitting the wall.

01:27:01.160 --> 01:27:02.160
She's hitting the wall.

01:27:02.160 --> 01:27:03.160
Oh my God.

01:27:03.160 --> 01:27:04.160
I'm orb.

01:27:04.160 --> 01:27:05.160
Is she okay?

01:27:05.160 --> 01:27:12.160
I feel like these are just like such random emotions like as long as she's happy.

01:27:12.160 --> 01:27:15.160
Were you even paying attention?

01:27:15.160 --> 01:27:16.160
Yes.

01:27:16.160 --> 01:27:17.160
Oh my God.

01:27:17.160 --> 01:27:18.160
You're so needed.

01:27:18.160 --> 01:27:19.160
Right.

01:27:19.160 --> 01:27:20.160
Let's do it.

01:27:20.160 --> 01:27:23.160
Oh, stress goes up so much talking about these though.

01:27:23.160 --> 01:27:27.160
Her mental darkness goes up.

01:27:27.160 --> 01:27:30.160
But communication and rabbit hole go up so much though.

01:27:30.160 --> 01:27:34.160
Take a deep dive into the conspiracy of the world but don't go too deep.

01:27:34.160 --> 01:27:37.160
But I want her to do it.

01:27:37.160 --> 01:27:38.160
Right.

01:27:38.160 --> 01:27:42.160
She's definitely going to be on stress management but we're doing it.

01:27:42.160 --> 01:27:43.160
Wait.

01:27:43.160 --> 01:27:44.160
Yeah.

01:27:44.160 --> 01:27:45.160
Yeah.

01:27:45.160 --> 01:27:46.160
We're doing it.

01:27:46.160 --> 01:27:47.160
She's spain.

01:27:47.160 --> 01:27:48.160
She's an orb.

01:27:48.160 --> 01:27:49.160
She's orbudes.

01:27:49.160 --> 01:27:50.160
Wow.

01:27:50.160 --> 01:27:51.160
Look at them nails.

01:27:51.160 --> 01:27:52.160
Hey.

01:27:52.160 --> 01:27:53.160
You changed your nails already.

01:27:53.160 --> 01:27:59.160
They're supposed to be blue like your hair color and there's little things.

01:27:59.160 --> 01:28:01.160
Subscribble on ear.

01:28:02.160 --> 01:28:08.160
As technology improves by leaps and bounds perhaps one day we will all be bankrupt.

01:28:08.160 --> 01:28:09.160
Oh wait.

01:28:09.160 --> 01:28:10.160
Turn it down.

01:28:10.160 --> 01:28:11.160
Okay.

01:28:13.160 --> 01:28:14.160
K angel.

01:28:14.160 --> 01:28:15.160
Hey.

01:28:15.160 --> 01:28:16.160
Hello.

01:28:16.160 --> 01:28:17.160
Hello.

01:28:20.160 --> 01:28:21.160
Hey.

01:28:21.160 --> 01:28:22.160
Hello.

01:28:22.160 --> 01:28:23.160
Hi.

01:28:23.160 --> 01:28:24.160
Hi.

01:28:24.160 --> 01:28:25.160
Hi.

01:28:25.160 --> 01:28:26.160
And you come and you come.

01:28:26.160 --> 01:28:29.160
What would her fan base K angel fan base name be?

01:28:29.160 --> 01:28:35.160
If she's an angel and you follow an angel I guess so you're a worshipper really.

01:28:35.160 --> 01:28:37.160
Yeah.

01:28:37.160 --> 01:28:39.160
You just be fan name would be worshipper.

01:28:39.160 --> 01:28:40.160
K goals.

01:28:40.160 --> 01:28:41.160
Okay.

01:28:41.160 --> 01:28:42.160
Well I can't.

01:28:42.160 --> 01:28:43.160
Yeah.

01:28:43.160 --> 01:28:44.160
Yeah.

01:28:44.160 --> 01:28:45.160
She's a streamer.

01:28:45.160 --> 01:28:46.160
She's needy.

01:28:46.160 --> 01:28:50.160
And now we need to the overload of weekend rule credits.

01:28:50.160 --> 01:28:51.160
Their name is nerds.

01:28:51.160 --> 01:28:52.160
That's what she said.

01:28:52.160 --> 01:28:53.160
Oh okay.

01:28:53.160 --> 01:28:54.160
Okay.

01:28:54.160 --> 01:28:55.160
Call member.

01:28:55.160 --> 01:28:56.160
Let's go.

01:28:56.160 --> 01:28:58.160
See it's so slow.

01:28:58.160 --> 01:29:01.160
If you don't it's literally so slow.

01:29:01.160 --> 01:29:05.160
If I don't speed this up but it's like far too fast.

01:29:05.160 --> 01:29:07.160
I don't know maybe nothing's bugging out.

01:29:07.160 --> 01:29:11.160
I don't know the game seems pretty like the game seems pretty put well together.

01:29:11.160 --> 01:29:12.160
Do I need clicker?

01:29:12.160 --> 01:29:13.160
No.

01:29:15.160 --> 01:29:17.160
Nothing's happening.

01:29:17.160 --> 01:29:22.160
Imagine cities of people being controlled by microchips embedded from birth.

01:29:22.160 --> 01:29:24.160
Going into the deep end.

01:29:24.160 --> 01:29:25.160
Yeah.

01:29:27.160 --> 01:29:31.160
I'm barely doing work with work I can watch a game now.

01:29:31.160 --> 01:29:36.160
We're doing the politician route question mark or the conspiracy not route concert.

01:29:36.160 --> 01:29:38.160
I see you're also enlightened.

01:29:38.160 --> 01:29:39.160
Yeah.

01:29:39.160 --> 01:29:40.160
That's so scary.

01:29:40.160 --> 01:29:42.160
I got one in my arm.

01:29:42.160 --> 01:29:43.160
What?

01:29:43.160 --> 01:29:44.160
What?

01:29:45.160 --> 01:29:51.160
I've just noticed the music gets quieter when I tab over to do moderation stuff and then.

01:29:51.160 --> 01:29:55.160
That's a really good detail.

01:29:55.160 --> 01:29:57.160
I've got a microchip too.

01:29:58.160 --> 01:29:59.160
Is she going to?

01:29:59.160 --> 01:30:05.160
I feel like that's going to spur her on to do more microchip to do more of these types of streams.

01:30:05.160 --> 01:30:08.160
Another government conspiracy.

01:30:08.160 --> 01:30:11.160
Wait until you learn about that time.

01:30:11.160 --> 01:30:15.160
The ruling class could manipulate our brainwaves as we like.

01:30:15.160 --> 01:30:17.160
We'd all use our puppets.

01:30:17.160 --> 01:30:19.160
Oh my god.

01:30:19.160 --> 01:30:21.160
I don't want to be main controlled.

01:30:26.160 --> 01:30:27.160
No way.

01:30:27.160 --> 01:30:30.160
You mean I could be brainwashed right now?

01:30:30.160 --> 01:30:31.160
Oh wait.

01:30:34.160 --> 01:30:36.160
Where's my tinfoil hat?

01:30:36.160 --> 01:30:37.160
Exactly.

01:30:38.160 --> 01:30:40.160
We're going to be the tinfoil hat gang.

01:30:40.160 --> 01:30:44.160
Maybe just maybe we already have those chips in our arms.

01:30:45.160 --> 01:30:49.160
You could not be suggesting such a thing my innocent VTuber.

01:30:49.160 --> 01:30:51.160
Idol Angel.

01:30:51.160 --> 01:30:53.160
Kate Angel.

01:30:54.160 --> 01:30:56.160
Was that a scream?

01:30:56.160 --> 01:30:58.160
How did you find out about this?

01:30:58.160 --> 01:31:01.160
Take that instead of the microchip thing.

01:31:11.160 --> 01:31:15.160
We'll be living under a dictatorship soon mark my words.

01:31:16.160 --> 01:31:19.160
We are all on a watch list right now.

01:31:20.160 --> 01:31:22.160
Kate Angel branded tinfoil hat.

01:31:22.160 --> 01:31:24.160
Hat marriage win honestly.

01:31:24.160 --> 01:31:27.160
I'm not going to be able to sleep after this.

01:31:29.160 --> 01:31:31.160
The music is so good.

01:31:31.160 --> 01:31:33.160
I don't know who crafted it but.

01:31:34.160 --> 01:31:37.160
As if that technology could exist.

01:31:37.160 --> 01:31:39.160
Relax people.

01:31:40.160 --> 01:31:41.160
Thank god.

01:31:41.160 --> 01:31:42.160
Phew.

01:31:43.160 --> 01:31:45.160
Stronecottle's branded tinfoil.

01:31:45.160 --> 01:31:48.160
Literally just get tinfoil out of the cupboard.

01:31:48.160 --> 01:31:50.160
That was scary.

01:31:54.160 --> 01:31:55.160
For now anyway.

01:31:55.160 --> 01:31:57.160
Oh her eyes are starting to change.

01:31:57.160 --> 01:31:59.160
Am I noticing that?

01:32:01.160 --> 01:32:03.160
I'm actually going to leave that one.

01:32:05.160 --> 01:32:07.160
I'll leave the dystopia one.

01:32:08.160 --> 01:32:09.160
But yeah.

01:32:09.160 --> 01:32:12.160
Her eyes are changing or have I just made that up?

01:32:13.160 --> 01:32:15.160
Please talk about this forever Kate Angel.

01:32:15.160 --> 01:32:16.160
She's going.

01:32:16.160 --> 01:32:18.160
Oh my god I'm loving this route.

01:32:20.160 --> 01:32:23.160
Is the music going up because she's going this route?

01:32:23.160 --> 01:32:24.160
Because I don't remember.

01:32:24.160 --> 01:32:26.160
You're not like the other girls.

01:32:26.160 --> 01:32:28.160
Yeah she ain't.

01:32:28.160 --> 01:32:30.160
I'm going to make sure of it.

01:32:30.160 --> 01:32:33.160
I feel like I'm going to fall really hard for Kate Angel.

01:32:40.160 --> 01:32:43.160
That click mouse button sounds like the

01:32:43.160 --> 01:32:46.160
Legend of Zelda Minish Cap raindroplets

01:32:46.160 --> 01:32:47.160
or slime droplets.

01:32:47.160 --> 01:32:49.160
Let's have a look see.

01:32:51.160 --> 01:32:53.160
I don't want to be mind controlled.

01:32:56.160 --> 01:32:58.160
Scary isn't it?

01:32:58.160 --> 01:33:01.160
It'd be scary if I were real though.

01:33:02.160 --> 01:33:04.160
How did you find out about this?

01:33:07.160 --> 01:33:09.160
Um, why do you ask?

01:33:09.160 --> 01:33:11.160
Am I being interrogated?

01:33:11.160 --> 01:33:13.160
The government must have sent you to kill me.

01:33:13.160 --> 01:33:14.160
Wait.

01:33:14.160 --> 01:33:15.160
Girl.

01:33:16.160 --> 01:33:17.160
Bless.

01:33:17.160 --> 01:33:18.160
Amen.

01:33:18.160 --> 01:33:20.160
Amen in the chat.

01:33:20.160 --> 01:33:22.160
Why are you guys saying bless or whatever?

01:33:22.160 --> 01:33:24.160
Because we're a cult though.

01:33:25.160 --> 01:33:26.160
Bless.

01:33:26.160 --> 01:33:27.160
We're a cult.

01:33:27.160 --> 01:33:28.160
Bless.

01:33:28.160 --> 01:33:30.160
Literally get them hand emojis out there.

01:33:30.160 --> 01:33:31.160
Bless.

01:33:31.160 --> 01:33:32.160
Couldn't come up with a better greeting.

01:33:32.160 --> 01:33:33.160
Greeting.

01:33:33.160 --> 01:33:34.160
We're about to be out.

01:33:34.160 --> 01:33:36.160
The cult is forming.

01:33:42.160 --> 01:33:43.160
What have I done?

01:33:47.160 --> 01:33:50.160
I should have really like a scream being incorporated into the music.

01:33:50.160 --> 01:33:51.160
Ah, look at you.

01:33:51.160 --> 01:33:52.160
Bless.

01:33:52.160 --> 01:33:53.160
She did it.

01:33:53.160 --> 01:33:55.160
We do have to maintain.

01:33:55.160 --> 01:33:56.160
Help me.

01:33:56.160 --> 01:33:59.160
The microchip in my arm is controlling what I post.

01:33:59.160 --> 01:34:02.160
Microchips are like whatever because even without them,

01:34:02.160 --> 01:34:05.160
you still can't prove that we actually have free will.

01:34:05.160 --> 01:34:07.160
Oh, she's at breaking point.

01:34:07.160 --> 01:34:08.160
She's at breaking point.

01:34:08.160 --> 01:34:11.160
Definitely de-stressed day today.

01:34:11.160 --> 01:34:13.160
Hello, pumpkin spice.

01:34:13.160 --> 01:34:17.160
I believe this is the biggest de-stresser I can do to you right now.

01:34:17.160 --> 01:34:20.160
It does take me all the way.

01:34:21.160 --> 01:34:24.160
If we miss a day of streaming, it takes it to 65.

01:34:24.160 --> 01:34:26.160
Or if we do that, it's 71.

01:34:26.160 --> 01:34:28.160
Oh, it's still quite high.

01:34:28.160 --> 01:34:31.160
I don't want her on edge though.

01:34:34.160 --> 01:34:36.160
These didn't do anything.

01:34:36.160 --> 01:34:39.160
If she takes a third one, it gives her an idea,

01:34:39.160 --> 01:34:42.160
like a psychedelic route you can maybe do.

01:34:44.160 --> 01:34:45.160
No, right.

01:34:45.160 --> 01:34:47.160
We'll do...

01:34:47.160 --> 01:34:48.160
We'll just do this.

01:34:48.160 --> 01:34:50.160
I know it takes us tonight,

01:34:50.160 --> 01:34:53.160
but I really want her to do...

01:34:54.160 --> 01:34:56.160
Oh, I keep ignoring her messages.

01:34:56.160 --> 01:34:57.160
I'm sorry.

01:34:57.160 --> 01:34:58.160
I keep forgetting.

01:35:00.160 --> 01:35:03.160
I'm super like manager in this right now.

01:35:03.160 --> 01:35:06.160
I'm not like VTuber manager groomer.

01:35:06.160 --> 01:35:07.160
I'm like proper manager.

01:35:07.160 --> 01:35:09.160
Like I'm going to make you successful.

01:35:09.160 --> 01:35:11.160
I get some blue DMs from guys.

01:35:11.160 --> 01:35:12.160
Oh, my God.

01:35:13.160 --> 01:35:14.160
On Marshmallow.

01:35:15.160 --> 01:35:18.160
I don't think I haven't been seeing what I've been getting.

01:35:18.160 --> 01:35:19.160
But let me just...

01:35:19.160 --> 01:35:21.160
Let me just say that this is not okay.

01:35:21.160 --> 01:35:23.160
Wait, what?

01:35:24.160 --> 01:35:26.160
But that's the best part.

01:35:26.160 --> 01:35:29.160
Okay, we're doing ASMR.

01:35:29.160 --> 01:35:30.160
I never thought about doing it

01:35:30.160 --> 01:35:32.160
in my k-angel outfit profile.

01:35:32.160 --> 01:35:34.160
Oh, hi, wait.

01:35:34.160 --> 01:35:35.160
Oh, wait.

01:35:35.160 --> 01:35:36.160
My clothes are finding crumpled.

01:35:36.160 --> 01:35:38.160
Do you think that I'll be fine to go on camera?

01:35:38.160 --> 01:35:40.160
Oh, well, if I can't leave...

01:35:40.160 --> 01:35:41.160
Oh, wait.

01:35:41.160 --> 01:35:42.160
No, this is a regular...

01:35:42.160 --> 01:35:43.160
Oh, well, if I can't leave...

01:35:43.160 --> 01:35:46.160
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

01:35:48.160 --> 01:35:49.160
I mean...

01:35:49.160 --> 01:35:51.160
I mean, true.

01:35:52.160 --> 01:35:53.160
But like...

01:35:53.160 --> 01:35:54.160
You do get suspended and stuff,

01:35:54.160 --> 01:35:56.160
but a little head pat because you don't...

01:35:56.160 --> 01:35:58.160
Who's a good swag?

01:35:58.160 --> 01:36:00.160
You're my good swag, aren't you?

01:36:00.160 --> 01:36:02.160
Oh, who's my good swag?

01:36:02.160 --> 01:36:03.160
Not click-bleat.

01:36:03.160 --> 01:36:05.160
Not click-bleat.

01:36:05.160 --> 01:36:07.160
Not click-bleat.

01:36:07.160 --> 01:36:10.160
Not to collect the eight.

01:36:10.160 --> 01:36:11.160
Jesus.

01:36:11.160 --> 01:36:13.160
Lying down and...

01:36:13.160 --> 01:36:15.160
Is it super comfy?

01:36:15.160 --> 01:36:18.160
I think I need to get a water and a cola.

01:36:18.160 --> 01:36:20.160
The words are mashing together.

01:36:20.160 --> 01:36:21.160
And now I can't get up.

01:36:21.160 --> 01:36:22.160
Come, please help me.

01:36:22.160 --> 01:36:23.160
Yes.

01:36:24.160 --> 01:36:26.160
I'm freaking...

01:36:26.160 --> 01:36:28.160
I think I have to get a cola and a water,

01:36:28.160 --> 01:36:29.160
unironically.

01:36:29.160 --> 01:36:32.160
The words start mashing together if I read for too long.

01:36:32.160 --> 01:36:35.160
Oh, our stress goes round and round.

01:36:35.160 --> 01:36:37.160
Is there any stream that doesn't put your stress up?

01:36:37.160 --> 01:36:39.160
Like, I don't feel stressed when I stream.

01:36:39.160 --> 01:36:40.160
Is that bad?

01:36:41.160 --> 01:36:43.160
Do we have to skip?

01:36:43.160 --> 01:36:45.160
Honestly, do we have to skip?

01:36:49.160 --> 01:36:52.160
I think we skip and do ASMR tomorrow.

01:36:54.160 --> 01:36:55.160
Um, no.

01:36:55.160 --> 01:36:56.160
Not the medication.

01:36:56.160 --> 01:36:58.160
I don't think that's a good route for you, darling,

01:36:58.160 --> 01:37:00.160
because if you start relying on it...

01:37:00.160 --> 01:37:05.160
67 to watch something.

01:37:06.160 --> 01:37:10.160
65 to play together or...

01:37:12.160 --> 01:37:14.160
59.

01:37:14.160 --> 01:37:15.160
59.

01:37:16.160 --> 01:37:17.160
Yeah, no stream.

01:37:17.160 --> 01:37:18.160
We'll do ASMR tomorrow.

01:37:18.160 --> 01:37:19.160
No stream.

01:37:20.160 --> 01:37:22.160
Let her take a day off, yes.

01:37:22.160 --> 01:37:23.160
Can't really.

01:37:23.160 --> 01:37:24.160
I stream every single day,

01:37:24.160 --> 01:37:26.160
so I'm not really sure what the issue is, hen.

01:37:27.160 --> 01:37:29.160
If I ever find my special someone,

01:37:29.160 --> 01:37:31.160
I want to go to the amusement park

01:37:31.160 --> 01:37:32.160
with them.

01:37:32.160 --> 01:37:33.160
We can scream together.

01:37:33.160 --> 01:37:34.160
Scream together?

01:37:34.160 --> 01:37:35.160
Eat ice cream together?

01:37:35.160 --> 01:37:36.160
Rape the Ferris wheel?

01:37:36.160 --> 01:37:37.160
Why would you scream?

01:37:37.160 --> 01:37:39.160
Oh, an amusement park!

01:37:39.160 --> 01:37:40.160
Sorry.

01:37:40.160 --> 01:37:42.160
I thought it meant a park park, like,

01:37:42.160 --> 01:37:44.160
that one in New York City or something.

01:37:44.160 --> 01:37:45.160
Why would you scream there?

01:37:48.160 --> 01:37:50.160
Uh, I made up with Peachhan.

01:37:50.160 --> 01:37:51.160
I made up with Peachhan,

01:37:51.160 --> 01:37:52.160
and then things got a bit...

01:37:52.160 --> 01:37:53.160
What?

01:37:53.160 --> 01:37:54.160
Wait, you made up?

01:37:54.160 --> 01:37:55.160
You fell out?

01:37:58.160 --> 01:38:01.160
Is she, like, super lovey-and-dovey?

01:38:05.160 --> 01:38:06.160
Monetization.

01:38:06.160 --> 01:38:07.160
Oh, she got monetization!

01:38:07.160 --> 01:38:08.160
Congrats!

01:38:08.160 --> 01:38:09.160
That's perfect.

01:38:09.160 --> 01:38:10.160
You're amazing.

01:38:10.160 --> 01:38:12.160
Ignoring you.

01:38:12.160 --> 01:38:13.160
No, you're not.

01:38:13.160 --> 01:38:15.160
You're literally freaking sending me emojis.

01:38:16.160 --> 01:38:20.160
We won't get convicted

01:38:20.160 --> 01:38:22.160
because those online nerds

01:38:22.160 --> 01:38:24.160
can pay for our rent, Jesus.

01:38:24.160 --> 01:38:25.160
Dodged a bullet there.

01:38:25.160 --> 01:38:27.160
I don't want to have us

01:38:27.160 --> 01:38:29.160
to stream out on the streets.

01:38:29.160 --> 01:38:30.160
I really need a cola.

01:38:30.160 --> 01:38:32.160
I need a freaking...

01:38:32.160 --> 01:38:34.160
I'm gonna go grab a cola in a war.

01:38:34.160 --> 01:38:35.160
I'll literally be a second.

01:38:35.160 --> 01:38:36.160
I'm like...

01:38:36.160 --> 01:38:38.160
Oh, my God, I can't.

01:38:38.160 --> 01:38:39.160
There's so many words to word.

01:38:39.160 --> 01:38:40.160
I don't know if you guys get this,

01:38:40.160 --> 01:38:42.160
but if you read for too long,

01:38:42.160 --> 01:38:44.160
all the letters start merging together,

01:38:44.160 --> 01:38:46.160
and it's really hard to think of.

01:38:46.160 --> 01:38:47.160
Like, a context,

01:38:47.160 --> 01:38:49.160
a view of one heritage.

01:38:49.160 --> 01:38:51.160
The actual word is...

01:38:52.160 --> 01:39:01.160
It's not over all my feelings.

01:39:01.160 --> 01:39:03.160
I don't know how you do it,

01:39:03.160 --> 01:39:05.160
but maybe you're a bit different...

01:39:05.160 --> 01:39:08.160
And yes, I did just keep talking

01:39:08.160 --> 01:39:09.160
while I walked into the room.

01:39:09.160 --> 01:39:10.160
I probably didn't even hear anything.

01:39:10.160 --> 01:39:11.160
I got my cola in a war.

01:39:11.160 --> 01:39:13.160
I'm gonna take a little sipping tin.

01:39:13.160 --> 01:39:17.160
Put my blanket around me again.

01:39:17.160 --> 01:39:19.160
I'm actually wearing underwear today.

01:39:19.160 --> 01:39:20.160
I can't believe it.

01:39:20.160 --> 01:39:21.160
It's a Christmas miracle,

01:39:21.160 --> 01:39:27.160
But I'm not wearing a hoodie, I've just got my blanket like a poncho, like a poncho.

01:39:31.160 --> 01:39:34.160
These streams are always a blast to watch, yeah?

01:39:34.160 --> 01:39:36.160
Are you ready for the rabbit hole route ending?

01:39:36.160 --> 01:39:41.160
I actually kind of, I'm interested to see what the other endings are.

01:39:41.160 --> 01:39:48.160
I don't think I'm going to do the other endings, so please don't get excited for a strapped in big long stream or anything like that.

01:39:49.160 --> 01:39:54.160
I think I will happily watch what the other endings look like.

01:39:54.160 --> 01:39:57.160
Let's take a little water sipping tin.

01:39:57.160 --> 01:40:04.160
If you are remaining seated, please do wiggle, move your foot up and down.

01:40:04.160 --> 01:40:10.160
And if you feel your calf muscles flex, then that's good because that is helping the circulation in your legs.

01:40:10.160 --> 01:40:13.160
Just do a few of those and then you're good to go.

01:40:13.160 --> 01:40:17.160
See you later, bye bye, thanks for hanging, I appreciate it.

01:40:17.160 --> 01:40:20.160
Shibi cotton bum, 30 minutes.

01:40:20.160 --> 01:40:22.160
Shibi cotton bum, 30 minutes.

01:40:22.160 --> 01:40:25.160
I will redirect into her though, so don't worry about 30 minutes.

01:40:28.160 --> 01:40:30.160
That's right, you better wiggle.

01:40:30.160 --> 01:40:33.160
We're increasing that blood circulation for you.

01:40:35.160 --> 01:40:40.160
Oh, I just realized I can't hear any game sound at all right now.

01:40:40.160 --> 01:40:42.160
Is it because of that tab out?

01:40:43.160 --> 01:40:49.160
No, I guess it's the end of the day, so to symbolize it's the end of the day the music stops.

01:40:49.160 --> 01:40:51.160
I was like, where is it?

01:40:51.160 --> 01:40:55.160
You know, some things may be cliche, but they're cliche for a reason like this.

01:40:55.160 --> 01:40:58.160
Welcome home darling, would you like to have dinner first or a bath or me?

01:41:00.160 --> 01:41:03.160
Wait, is this cause affection is so high?

01:41:07.160 --> 01:41:09.160
I think so.

01:41:10.160 --> 01:41:15.160
The music is different as well and she's animated different.

01:41:15.160 --> 01:41:19.160
Okay, I like this kind of detail, like these subtle things.

01:41:22.160 --> 01:41:25.160
Oh wow, I'm like appreciating this game.

01:41:29.160 --> 01:41:31.160
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

01:41:31.160 --> 01:41:36.160
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, did we just, we were supposed to do an ASMR?

01:41:37.160 --> 01:41:42.160
Oh no, she's gonna be crazy for me, she's gonna go frickin' yandere.

01:41:43.160 --> 01:41:47.160
Oh my god, I don't want her to go yandere, I need to like ignore her a little bit.

01:41:47.160 --> 01:41:51.160
I don't want her to go yandere, I want her to go politicization.

01:41:55.160 --> 01:41:59.160
No, no, you have to, you have to stream, you have to stream.

01:41:59.160 --> 01:42:09.160
Oh no, I'm, I'm, I'm frickin', I, I successfully gripped my feature for talent, but I didn't want to.

01:42:10.160 --> 01:42:14.160
Right, go stream ASMR please.

01:42:14.160 --> 01:42:18.160
Okay, it drops affection dramatically doing ASMR, that's good.

01:42:18.160 --> 01:42:20.160
We'll do that.

01:42:20.160 --> 01:42:25.160
Go be unaffectionate for your frickin' manager, cause that was highly inappropriate.

01:42:25.160 --> 01:42:28.160
She's like yandere on me, she's called Mercy Mode, honestly.

01:42:29.160 --> 01:42:33.160
You're too good, I'm too good in this sheet, she can't, suffering from success literally.

01:42:36.160 --> 01:42:37.160
Wow.

01:42:39.160 --> 01:42:44.160
Oh, her eyes are different, am I going crazy or am I just makin' up that the eyes are different?

01:42:44.160 --> 01:42:48.160
Hi cuties, is your favorite Indian, sorry I just drank a cola, so.

01:42:48.160 --> 01:42:51.160
Is your favorite Indian Angel, Angel?

01:42:56.160 --> 01:42:57.160
I love you.

01:42:57.160 --> 01:42:59.160
Oh wait, no, that's a chat, I love you.

01:43:02.160 --> 01:43:05.160
Okay, we can do super chats today, I can see it now.

01:43:14.160 --> 01:43:15.160
Get the hole.

01:43:15.160 --> 01:43:16.160
What should we talk about today?

01:43:16.160 --> 01:43:24.160
Oh I know, I've got a bit of a trivia about the corned beef I ate yesterday, what are you talking about?

01:43:26.160 --> 01:43:28.160
Is this relevant to the ASMR?

01:43:28.160 --> 01:43:30.160
Is this relevant to the ASMR stream?

01:43:32.160 --> 01:43:38.160
I don't, oh yeah, corned beef trivia, I've never been so interested in corned beef before.

01:43:38.160 --> 01:43:42.160
Wait, please talk every day about corned beef.

01:43:42.160 --> 01:43:46.160
Okay, her chat's actually really funny, I'm gonna give it to him.

01:43:46.160 --> 01:43:54.160
Corned beef ASMR literally, did you know that corned beef is shaped so because of old canning methods, which would?

01:43:56.160 --> 01:43:59.160
Is her heart pounding?

01:44:00.160 --> 01:44:01.160
No.

01:44:05.160 --> 01:44:08.160
Is her heart pounding because she's so in love at the moment?

01:44:09.160 --> 01:44:12.160
Good stream, but that's all it was, just good.

01:44:14.160 --> 01:44:18.160
That's a backhanded comment, so we will remove it because that's not very pleasant.

01:44:19.160 --> 01:44:27.160
Does this game have scenes that I need to be nervous about?

01:44:30.160 --> 01:44:33.160
Does this game have scenes that I need to be nervous about?

01:44:34.160 --> 01:44:38.160
A subbing for sure, omega lol.

01:44:39.160 --> 01:44:43.160
I did not know that was gonna happen, hey don't look, you can't.

01:44:43.160 --> 01:44:47.160
I didn't know, okay the game's safe, it's safe, okay it's safe.

01:44:47.160 --> 01:44:49.160
I didn't know if it was gonna go any further.

01:44:51.160 --> 01:44:53.160
You've just got yourself a new fan.

01:44:55.160 --> 01:44:58.160
Oh my god, I suppose I could give you a smaller one.

01:44:58.160 --> 01:45:03.160
Oh my god, that's so mean when the bikini freaking toggle came on and I'm just meanin' about typing.

01:45:05.160 --> 01:45:06.160
I didn't even notice.

01:45:07.160 --> 01:45:08.160
Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you.

01:45:08.160 --> 01:45:13.160
Okay this game, this game, I know it's early days because we haven't finished our route

01:45:13.160 --> 01:45:16.160
but I wanna say this is 10 out of 10 already for me.

01:45:16.160 --> 01:45:19.160
This game, highly enjoying it, highly.

01:45:22.160 --> 01:45:26.160
Literally flush emoji, flush emoji momento.

01:45:27.160 --> 01:45:28.160
This is so good.

01:45:31.160 --> 01:45:35.160
You're gonna get big I can feel it, yes okay, I thought I read that.

01:45:35.160 --> 01:45:40.160
Thank you mother for having me, thank you for spawning me in on the same timeline as you stream.

01:45:40.160 --> 01:45:43.160
You just made me smile for the rest of my life.

01:45:45.160 --> 01:45:50.160
I suppose as a nicer compliment then I give you a reward.

01:45:51.160 --> 01:45:55.160
But if she needs to pay rent and get more equipment, cause we got that microphone.

01:45:55.160 --> 01:45:58.160
I will never forget the stream for as long as I live.

01:45:59.160 --> 01:46:02.160
Don't worry it's already been archived eight times over, you don't got to worry.

01:46:03.160 --> 01:46:04.160
Can you do a workout stream?

01:46:05.160 --> 01:46:07.160
Oh, is there like a fitness route?

01:46:08.160 --> 01:46:10.160
That would actually be kind of cool, you can like make her boss.

01:46:11.160 --> 01:46:13.160
I feel like you're trying too hard.

01:46:15.160 --> 01:46:16.160
You're out.

01:46:16.160 --> 01:46:18.160
You will not hurt my streamer's feelings.

01:46:19.160 --> 01:46:22.160
Guess this makes you an arch angel for now.

01:46:25.160 --> 01:46:26.160
Wait, wait, wait, let me read that again.

01:46:27.160 --> 01:46:29.160
Guess that makes you an arch angel now.

01:46:32.160 --> 01:46:33.160
Oh, that didn't work.

01:46:34.160 --> 01:46:35.160
Oh no, did that work?

01:46:36.160 --> 01:46:40.160
No, my freaking thing doesn't work.

01:46:43.160 --> 01:46:45.160
My freaking brooms doesn't work.

01:46:46.160 --> 01:46:47.160
I'm so sad.

01:46:49.160 --> 01:46:52.160
No, stop, stop giving me money for something so small.

01:46:55.160 --> 01:46:58.160
You feel, wait, take my memory wipe beam.

01:47:03.160 --> 01:47:05.160
Oh, my freaking sand board's dead.

01:47:05.160 --> 01:47:06.160
I don't know why it's dead.

01:47:08.160 --> 01:47:09.160
Come on guys.

01:47:09.160 --> 01:47:10.160
Oh, someone's message me.

01:47:15.160 --> 01:47:18.160
Oh, Amy is such a fucking hard worker, you know that.

01:47:18.160 --> 01:47:19.160
Hold on, hold on, game, game.

01:47:21.160 --> 01:47:23.160
Did I accidentally go a little overboard?

01:47:23.160 --> 01:47:26.160
Yeah, you're just popped it.

01:47:27.160 --> 01:47:31.160
Hmm, I got way better numbers showing a bit.

01:47:31.160 --> 01:47:32.160
Hmm, I wonder how that worked.

01:47:32.160 --> 01:47:34.160
Hmm, I truly am a mystery.

01:47:35.160 --> 01:47:36.160
Can I talk to her?

01:47:36.160 --> 01:47:37.160
Oh, wait, we got our goal.

01:47:38.160 --> 01:47:39.160
She wanted 100k.

01:47:39.160 --> 01:47:40.160
She did it.

01:47:40.160 --> 01:47:41.160
Wait, we've won already?

01:47:41.160 --> 01:47:42.160
That's not right.

01:47:47.160 --> 01:47:49.160
Did she not want 100k?

01:47:50.160 --> 01:47:51.160
This isn't the first time reaching so many.

01:47:51.160 --> 01:47:52.160
I don't know what's going to happen for you.

01:47:52.160 --> 01:47:53.160
I'm a bit nervous.

01:47:54.160 --> 01:47:56.160
She wanted a milk.

01:47:56.160 --> 01:47:57.160
Oh, Hen, that's greedy.

01:47:57.160 --> 01:48:04.160
Hen, Hen, you're supposed to take down the capitalist cog of greediness.

01:48:04.160 --> 01:48:05.160
Okay.

01:48:06.160 --> 01:48:08.160
I need to thank them for their devotion.

01:48:08.160 --> 01:48:12.160
Yeah, I think she's going to get, yeah, yeah, yeah, definitely do a thank you stream

01:48:12.160 --> 01:48:14.160
because that's like insane.

01:48:14.160 --> 01:48:19.160
What we will do is nothing affection wise.

01:48:20.160 --> 01:48:23.160
Definitely stress though.

01:48:24.160 --> 01:48:27.160
Yeah, we'll just make her watch two videos in a row, I think.

01:48:27.160 --> 01:48:28.160
Who goes there?

01:48:28.160 --> 01:48:29.160
Identify yourself.

01:48:31.160 --> 01:48:38.160
As long as the fiction doesn't go up, then I'm happy.

01:48:38.160 --> 01:48:42.160
I was watching this idol video and they were all eating popsicles for some reason.

01:48:42.160 --> 01:48:44.160
I already know where.

01:48:45.160 --> 01:48:49.160
Oh, ASMR.

01:48:49.160 --> 01:48:53.160
Oh, she's wanting the ASMR route, but I'm wanting the different route.

01:48:53.160 --> 01:48:55.160
I don't know how to get the fricking politician.

01:48:55.160 --> 01:48:57.160
I want the politician route.

01:48:57.160 --> 01:48:58.160
Is she okay?

01:48:58.160 --> 01:49:00.160
You look so annoyed there.

01:49:00.160 --> 01:49:03.160
Here, Jester asked me what I do and I was like, lol, I'm just a voice.

01:49:03.160 --> 01:49:05.160
That's what I was saying.

01:49:05.160 --> 01:49:10.160
If someone ever makes small talk with me, I'm just like, I'm just a voice actor.

01:49:11.160 --> 01:49:19.160
It's so much easier to explain than be like, I'm an anime woman on Das Interwebs, yeah?

01:49:19.160 --> 01:49:24.160
I'm just like, oh yeah, the Scottish voice is in demand all the time.

01:49:24.160 --> 01:49:29.160
You know, I get to play big strong women in my audios.

01:49:29.160 --> 01:49:32.160
Meanwhile, my audios are like, yeah, take it!

01:49:32.160 --> 01:49:41.160
Oh, can't she go outside for stress relief possibly?

01:49:41.160 --> 01:49:43.160
I'm dead, that's so cute.

01:49:43.160 --> 01:49:46.160
That's so cute, I'm dead.

01:49:48.160 --> 01:49:49.160
So not cute.

01:49:49.160 --> 01:49:51.160
Oh my god, I'm so sorry.

01:49:51.160 --> 01:49:52.160
Love forever.

01:49:52.160 --> 01:49:55.160
Did I just do that and then she's happy?

01:49:55.160 --> 01:49:59.160
Is she like talking to herself when she does that?

01:49:59.160 --> 01:50:02.160
Or is that a reflection on...

01:50:07.160 --> 01:50:10.160
If I sleep until night, her mental dark...

01:50:10.160 --> 01:50:12.160
Okay, so sleep gets rid of mental darkness.

01:50:12.160 --> 01:50:14.160
I think we will do that, that's lovely.

01:50:14.160 --> 01:50:16.160
Yes, just have a wee nap, hen.

01:50:16.160 --> 01:50:18.160
You've deserved it, we rest.

01:50:19.160 --> 01:50:22.160
Okay, mental darkness.

01:50:22.160 --> 01:50:23.160
I hate this.

01:50:23.160 --> 01:50:25.160
Shaky.

01:50:25.160 --> 01:50:27.160
I wouldn't say...

01:50:27.160 --> 01:50:29.160
Are you okay?

01:50:29.160 --> 01:50:31.160
Why are you looking at me like that?

01:50:31.160 --> 01:50:33.160
I woke up on record time this morning, please...

01:50:33.160 --> 01:50:36.160
This morning is night time.

01:50:36.160 --> 01:50:38.160
Selfie time.

01:50:38.160 --> 01:50:40.160
You're such a girl, honestly.

01:50:40.160 --> 01:50:42.160
Selfie time, I mean...

01:50:42.160 --> 01:50:44.160
Wait, so why is that highlighted?

01:50:44.160 --> 01:50:45.160
Give me this!

01:50:45.160 --> 01:50:46.160
How do I unlock this?

01:50:46.160 --> 01:50:50.160
Does it tell you how to progress or is it just it happens?

01:50:50.160 --> 01:50:53.160
I want rabbit holes so badly.

01:50:53.160 --> 01:50:55.160
But don't go too deep.

01:50:58.160 --> 01:50:59.160
No.

01:50:59.160 --> 01:51:01.160
Right, we'll do...

01:51:01.160 --> 01:51:04.160
Thank you for 100k, because that is very...

01:51:04.160 --> 01:51:07.160
Special milestone to celebrate and it's fantastic.

01:51:07.160 --> 01:51:10.160
Just got to look around the ideals.

01:51:12.160 --> 01:51:14.160
You have to find it, oh...

01:51:14.160 --> 01:51:16.160
Okay, I think...

01:51:16.160 --> 01:51:18.160
Conspiracies would be...

01:51:18.160 --> 01:51:20.160
Not in a video.

01:51:22.160 --> 01:51:24.160
Okay, we can do this...

01:51:24.160 --> 01:51:26.160
I need to play that Russian song...

01:51:26.160 --> 01:51:28.160
La la la la la la la la...

01:51:28.160 --> 01:51:30.160
I can never remember it.

01:51:34.160 --> 01:51:36.160
Having my...

01:51:37.160 --> 01:51:39.160
Coca-Cola, he's too mad.

01:51:44.160 --> 01:51:47.160
Don't politicians usually have high stress and high mental darkness?

01:51:47.160 --> 01:51:48.160
I'm very greedy.

01:51:48.160 --> 01:51:52.160
I thought she said she wanted to become like some sort of...

01:51:55.160 --> 01:51:57.160
What's Socrates?

01:51:57.160 --> 01:52:00.160
Like a philosopher to rebuild a new world.

01:52:00.160 --> 01:52:02.160
I thought that's the kind of route that that angle took.

01:52:02.160 --> 01:52:03.160
That's what I'm trying to get.

01:52:03.160 --> 01:52:06.160
Well, that's what I think anyway, I don't actually know.

01:52:06.160 --> 01:52:10.160
Because I was kind of like, oh, let's be anti-Margaret Fatcher.

01:52:10.160 --> 01:52:12.160
And like, public...

01:52:12.160 --> 01:52:19.160
The resources of the nation need to be in the hands of the public and all that kind of thing.

01:52:19.160 --> 01:52:21.160
Yeah, yeah, I want to make her a god!

01:52:21.160 --> 01:52:23.160
Yes!

01:52:23.160 --> 01:52:26.160
Andrei, you've grown so much as an angel.

01:52:26.160 --> 01:52:27.160
Wow, that's...

01:52:27.160 --> 01:52:28.160
Your channel grows so fast.

01:52:28.160 --> 01:52:31.160
Our super, super popular.

01:52:31.160 --> 01:52:36.160
I'm an angel that came down from Earth from heaven to save everyone on the internet.

01:52:36.160 --> 01:52:38.160
Default setting too strong.

01:52:38.160 --> 01:52:41.160
I feel like you've said something similar before.

01:52:41.160 --> 01:52:43.160
Oh, I can't believe it.

01:52:43.160 --> 01:52:46.160
I can't believe Streamer repeated one sentence.

01:52:46.160 --> 01:52:49.160
We're not reading comments for the stream.

01:52:49.160 --> 01:52:52.160
Thank you for coming to bless us.

01:52:54.160 --> 01:52:56.160
I like how she's...

01:52:56.160 --> 01:53:00.160
That's so gross down here, you should go back to heaven.

01:53:00.160 --> 01:53:02.160
Oh...

01:53:05.160 --> 01:53:11.160
The internet is oversaturated with users and content, but it's hard to tell what to believe in.

01:53:11.160 --> 01:53:13.160
Yes, you should do more conspiracies.

01:53:13.160 --> 01:53:19.160
Whenever you feel lost, I want you to know that you can believe in me.

01:53:19.160 --> 01:53:21.160
All right.

01:53:24.160 --> 01:53:27.160
Save us, my angel.

01:53:31.160 --> 01:53:33.160
And all believers will be...

01:53:33.160 --> 01:53:35.160
Whoa, we're doing the rapture.

01:53:35.160 --> 01:53:36.160
All believers will be saved.

01:53:36.160 --> 01:53:38.160
You just need to have a little fight.

01:53:38.160 --> 01:53:42.160
As the internet angel, I will always be by your side.

01:53:47.160 --> 01:53:51.160
It says exactly like that one Russian song.

01:53:52.160 --> 01:53:54.160
Beginning of a cult, cult, cult, cult, cult.

01:53:54.160 --> 01:53:56.160
Give me a cult, give me a cult.

01:53:56.160 --> 01:53:58.160
I want cult ending.

01:53:58.160 --> 01:54:01.160
I'm so glad we got tinfoil, foil, hat, merch.

01:54:01.160 --> 01:54:04.160
I wear it all the time when I watch your streams, Kate Angel.

01:54:16.160 --> 01:54:18.160
That's actually really nice.

01:54:18.160 --> 01:54:20.160
I think that's a good sentiment.

01:54:21.160 --> 01:54:25.160
Your smile is bright enough to illuminate the hearts of all 100K of us.

01:54:25.160 --> 01:54:27.160
Change 100K.

01:54:27.160 --> 01:54:29.160
Does she not say she eats these?

01:54:29.160 --> 01:54:32.160
Am I going to fail if I don't get her the numbers sometime?

01:54:32.160 --> 01:54:37.160
I'd like, do you always get the numbers and it's like a unique ending to whoever?

01:54:37.160 --> 01:54:40.160
Strongly blessing us with ink in this universe.

01:54:40.160 --> 01:54:42.160
This game gives Valhalla.

01:54:42.160 --> 01:54:44.160
I've never played that game.

01:54:44.160 --> 01:54:47.160
Oh, is this simple?

01:54:48.160 --> 01:54:50.160
Obviously, thank you.

01:55:00.160 --> 01:55:02.160
I skipped school a lot so I didn't have any friends.

01:55:02.160 --> 01:55:04.160
I don't like when she gets a bit real.

01:55:04.160 --> 01:55:07.160
Only the people online cared about what I had to fuck it up with.

01:55:07.160 --> 01:55:10.160
I used to sit on Xbox and skip school because I had a rough time.

01:55:10.160 --> 01:55:13.160
Hold on a minute, hold on a minute, hold on a minute.

01:55:13.160 --> 01:55:16.160
I feel like a lot of v-tubers probably had a rough time socializing

01:55:16.160 --> 01:55:21.160
and that's how they've got the internet culture to be a v-tuber in the first place.

01:55:21.160 --> 01:55:23.160
Or is she idle?

01:55:23.160 --> 01:55:26.160
She's not v-tubers, she's just idle.

01:55:27.160 --> 01:55:30.160
I didn't know angels had to go to school too.

01:55:31.160 --> 01:55:33.160
Valhalla is a great experience.

01:55:33.160 --> 01:55:34.160
How many ever?

01:55:34.160 --> 01:55:37.160
Big game, weak game, endurance game?

01:55:37.160 --> 01:55:39.160
She's v-tuber coded.

01:55:39.160 --> 01:55:42.160
I was bullied a lot, it's good for being so cute and pretty too.

01:55:42.160 --> 01:55:44.160
Jealousy is it?

01:55:44.160 --> 01:55:46.160
Try and stay humble, try and stay humble.

01:55:46.160 --> 01:55:48.160
Hold on a minute, hold on a minute.

01:55:48.160 --> 01:55:50.160
Can't relate to that part of it anyway.

01:55:59.160 --> 01:56:05.160
Did I ever tell you at my job, I actually didn't know it was polite to say good morning to people.

01:56:05.160 --> 01:56:07.160
That's how socially inept I was.

01:56:07.160 --> 01:56:12.160
I had to learn to say good morning, which is why I like saying good morning, good evening, good afternoon to you guys

01:56:12.160 --> 01:56:17.160
because I think that hopefully you do get to learn things with me over time.

01:56:17.160 --> 01:56:21.160
As long as you have faith in me, I will find you within the darkness.

01:56:22.160 --> 01:56:26.160
I literally didn't know I was like, you say good morning to your cool workers like a dumbass

01:56:26.160 --> 01:56:31.160
and I didn't know that that was socializing and really common.

01:56:32.160 --> 01:56:35.160
Guess that makes you an archangel now.

01:56:35.160 --> 01:56:37.160
Oh, that's strange.

01:56:38.160 --> 01:56:40.160
Or is it just to signify,

01:56:40.160 --> 01:56:42.160
Remember, you're never alone.

01:56:42.160 --> 01:56:43.160
Bless.

01:56:43.160 --> 01:56:47.160
We are joining the call, the bless call, bless call, bless call.

01:56:49.160 --> 01:56:53.160
Kate Angel having 20 concurrent 100k followers to create a part of the game.

01:56:53.160 --> 01:56:55.160
Oh, unbelievable.

01:56:56.160 --> 01:57:01.160
I can't promise to save everyone because that would be a lie, but if there's just one person to be saved, where's my person?

01:57:01.160 --> 01:57:03.160
Can I just say something?

01:57:03.160 --> 01:57:05.160
Oh, she got found her.

01:57:05.160 --> 01:57:06.160
Oh, she's greeting.

01:57:06.160 --> 01:57:08.160
No, didn't cry.

01:57:08.160 --> 01:57:11.160
We didn't need to cry.

01:57:11.160 --> 01:57:13.160
Why didn't you draw a cry in?

01:57:14.160 --> 01:57:21.160
Only thing really to draw me crying is because I'm just so happy with that we did previously.

01:57:22.160 --> 01:57:29.160
If my smile can grant soul salvation, then I will keep smiling for all the viewers on there.

01:57:30.160 --> 01:57:34.160
Are we changing her personality as well to become a god?

01:57:40.160 --> 01:57:46.160
I can't play a game, do Q&A, rate a gigantic turtle around Shinjuku.

01:57:46.160 --> 01:57:50.160
No, I want her to do the conspiracy theory.

01:57:55.160 --> 01:57:58.160
None of these are conspiracy theory for later.

01:57:59.160 --> 01:58:00.160
Yeah, okay, okay.

01:58:02.160 --> 01:58:03.160
I hate this.

01:58:03.160 --> 01:58:05.160
Wait, did her stress go up there?

01:58:11.160 --> 01:58:13.160
Her affection's still too high for us.

01:58:13.160 --> 01:58:15.160
She's like doing this weird thing.

01:58:17.160 --> 01:58:19.160
How do I find...

01:58:19.160 --> 01:58:21.160
Do I find the idea here?

01:58:23.160 --> 01:58:27.160
I put her stress up her affection down and mental.

01:58:28.160 --> 01:58:31.160
But maybe it'll give us the fricking...

01:58:31.160 --> 01:58:35.160
I want the fricking politician.

01:58:38.160 --> 01:58:39.160
Oh.

01:58:39.160 --> 01:58:40.160
What?

01:58:41.160 --> 01:58:46.160
I just found out an author that I've liked ever since I was a kid watches the stream.

01:58:46.160 --> 01:58:47.160
It's like a dream come true.

01:58:47.160 --> 01:58:49.160
Someone looks like they'd make me so glad to start streaming.

01:58:49.160 --> 01:58:51.160
I'm happy that one of my favourites would miss me.

01:58:51.160 --> 01:58:53.160
But when I replied, he was like, do you want a video called The Disappointment?

01:58:53.160 --> 01:58:55.160
I fell out of that for the video.

01:58:55.160 --> 01:58:57.160
I thought this was a real start for the mental.

01:58:57.160 --> 01:58:58.160
Who says that anymore?

01:58:58.160 --> 01:58:59.160
Conspiracy?

01:58:59.160 --> 01:59:01.160
Conspiracy, please?

01:59:01.160 --> 01:59:03.160
Oh my god, what did you think?

01:59:03.160 --> 01:59:08.160
Do you ever get curious about what cringy things people have done online in the past?

01:59:08.160 --> 01:59:11.160
I reckon I could turn my past cringy into content or something.

01:59:11.160 --> 01:59:13.160
That's like watching your debut stream.

01:59:13.160 --> 01:59:16.160
Definitely VTubers watching their debut stream for the first time.

01:59:16.160 --> 01:59:19.160
Over again after a while has passed.

01:59:19.160 --> 01:59:21.160
I do agree that that's good content.

01:59:21.160 --> 01:59:23.160
I wouldn't mind showing our mock streams.

01:59:23.160 --> 01:59:26.160
I wouldn't show the girls' mock streams but my mock stream.

01:59:26.160 --> 01:59:32.160
I actually did better in my second mock stream attempt than I did in my debut.

01:59:32.160 --> 01:59:33.160
And that's fact.

01:59:33.160 --> 01:59:35.160
I'm happy to show it at a later time.

01:59:35.160 --> 01:59:39.160
It's a good idea, but to be honest, I just don't really want to do it.

01:59:39.160 --> 01:59:40.160
Oh, I just need to think.

01:59:40.160 --> 01:59:43.160
And it makes people want to die, but the suffering is what makes it interesting.

01:59:43.160 --> 01:59:44.160
So I guess I got...

01:59:44.160 --> 01:59:47.160
Being a streamer is so hard, girl.

01:59:49.160 --> 01:59:51.160
Being a streamer.

01:59:51.160 --> 01:59:53.160
I'm not putting you in any way.

01:59:55.160 --> 01:59:58.160
But then again, maybe the stars have aligned for someone like me.

01:59:58.160 --> 01:59:59.160
I know it's not.

01:59:59.160 --> 02:00:00.160
Can we not stream today?

02:00:00.160 --> 02:00:01.160
Day off, day off, day off.

02:00:01.160 --> 02:00:03.160
I need to blow some steam off.

02:00:04.160 --> 02:00:09.160
Right, if you're genuinely not wanting a day off, that's fine with me.

02:00:09.160 --> 02:00:12.160
I'm going to drug you up and see if that...

02:00:16.160 --> 02:00:18.160
Oh, she's going to get so messed up.

02:00:20.160 --> 02:00:22.160
She's going to get so messed up.

02:00:22.160 --> 02:00:25.160
And it puts her mental darkness up to 32.

02:00:26.160 --> 02:00:28.160
Are you sure?

02:00:28.160 --> 02:00:29.160
Yeah.

02:00:29.160 --> 02:00:30.160
You wanted a break.

02:00:30.160 --> 02:00:32.160
Pass out on these drugs.

02:00:32.160 --> 02:00:33.160
Have a good time, hen.

02:00:33.160 --> 02:00:34.160
Enjoy yourself.

02:00:35.160 --> 02:00:36.160
Three milligrams of the Azepam.

02:00:36.160 --> 02:00:38.160
We'll not do this here.

02:00:42.160 --> 02:00:43.160
Oh, no.

02:00:44.160 --> 02:00:45.160
Oh, no.

02:00:45.160 --> 02:00:47.160
I thought you were going to go to sleep.

02:00:58.160 --> 02:01:00.160
More than the sweet release of death,

02:01:00.160 --> 02:01:03.160
I crave the sweet, sweet follow account,

02:01:03.160 --> 02:01:06.160
but still, why is living so hard?

02:01:07.160 --> 02:01:10.160
I guess I'll pop a few pills before going live.

02:01:17.160 --> 02:01:18.160
Breakdown stream.

02:01:18.160 --> 02:01:19.160
No.

02:01:19.160 --> 02:01:20.160
Uh-uh.

02:01:20.160 --> 02:01:21.160
Get off lying.

02:01:21.160 --> 02:01:22.160
Get a break.

02:01:22.160 --> 02:01:23.160
No.

02:01:23.160 --> 02:01:24.160
You're getting closed.

02:01:24.160 --> 02:01:25.160
You asked for a day off.

02:01:25.160 --> 02:01:29.160
I gave you one and you give me break downstream?

02:01:31.160 --> 02:01:34.160
When I woke up, the sun was already setting.

02:01:34.160 --> 02:01:36.160
I still feel so lazy after sleeping so much.

02:01:36.160 --> 02:01:37.160
Can I just sleep forever?

02:01:37.160 --> 02:01:40.160
You're probably feeling what's known as the side effects.

02:01:40.160 --> 02:01:41.160
I'm sorry.

02:01:42.160 --> 02:01:43.160
Can I just sleep forever?

02:01:43.160 --> 02:01:44.160
Rest for a turn eight?

02:01:44.160 --> 02:01:45.160
No.

02:01:45.160 --> 02:01:46.160
Sure.

02:01:46.160 --> 02:01:48.160
Do you want to sleep again?

02:01:48.160 --> 02:01:50.160
That means I don't have to bother living in it.

02:01:54.160 --> 02:01:56.160
Is she off on or not?

02:01:57.160 --> 02:01:59.160
I think she may be off on or not.

02:02:06.160 --> 02:02:07.160
Is she okay?

02:02:08.160 --> 02:02:11.160
I don't think we should have done that one.

02:02:11.160 --> 02:02:13.160
Oh, she can go out!

02:02:18.160 --> 02:02:20.160
Oh, but who's fricking affectionate?

02:02:20.160 --> 02:02:21.160
Wait, Akihabara.

02:02:21.160 --> 02:02:25.160
Let's visit nerd culture, popular with young people.

02:02:25.160 --> 02:02:26.160
Young people?

02:02:26.160 --> 02:02:27.160
Oh, this is actually really cool.

02:02:27.160 --> 02:02:28.160
So can we map?

02:02:30.160 --> 02:02:31.160
Disneyland?

02:02:34.160 --> 02:02:35.160
Akihabara?

02:02:35.160 --> 02:02:36.160
Akihabara?

02:02:38.160 --> 02:02:39.160
Shinjuku?

02:02:39.160 --> 02:02:41.160
Wait, so it says Shinjuku, but I can't...

02:02:41.160 --> 02:02:42.160
Alright, okay, okay, okay.

02:02:42.160 --> 02:02:47.160
Maybe that's where our politician...

02:02:49.160 --> 02:02:51.160
I forgot sick women!

02:02:52.160 --> 02:02:53.160
Give me politician!

02:02:53.160 --> 02:02:54.160
Just go to sleep!

02:02:54.160 --> 02:02:55.160
Just go...

02:02:55.160 --> 02:02:56.160
Give me politician!

02:02:56.160 --> 02:02:57.160
Just sleep one more time.

02:02:57.160 --> 02:02:58.160
We're going to stream you absolutely to...

02:02:58.160 --> 02:02:59.160
It fails tomorrow.

02:03:03.160 --> 02:03:04.160
The moment I go to bed,

02:03:04.160 --> 02:03:06.160
all these horrible memories come flooding back to me.

02:03:06.160 --> 02:03:09.160
Oh, because you're on 28A, darkness?

02:03:09.160 --> 02:03:11.160
Oh, God, I'm so sorry.

02:03:11.160 --> 02:03:12.160
Oh, that's so sad.

02:03:12.160 --> 02:03:14.160
Oh, no, you can't...

02:03:15.160 --> 02:03:16.160
Oh, wait!

02:03:16.160 --> 02:03:18.160
There actually is an Ace of Arc category!

02:03:20.160 --> 02:03:22.160
Oh, that's so cool.

02:03:23.160 --> 02:03:24.160
Okay, that's really cool.

02:03:24.160 --> 02:03:26.160
How cool is it tomorrow?

02:03:27.160 --> 02:03:29.160
My silver award is getting for your fur.

02:03:29.160 --> 02:03:30.160
That's amazing.

02:03:30.160 --> 02:03:31.160
Okay, that's really good.

02:03:31.160 --> 02:03:33.160
Wait, but there's actually Ace of Arc.

02:03:33.160 --> 02:03:35.160
Oh, you're so fantastic.

02:03:35.160 --> 02:03:36.160
Oh, my God!

02:03:37.160 --> 02:03:40.160
You need to reach 80 mental darkness to prove...

02:03:41.160 --> 02:03:42.160
Aww!

02:03:44.160 --> 02:03:45.160
How...

02:03:46.160 --> 02:03:48.160
I need to make her mentally...

02:03:48.160 --> 02:03:50.160
You want mental darkness?

02:03:50.160 --> 02:03:51.160
80?

02:03:52.160 --> 02:03:53.160
That's so bad.

02:03:53.160 --> 02:03:54.160
How do I do that?

02:03:55.160 --> 02:03:57.160
That's terrible.

02:03:57.160 --> 02:03:58.160
How do I do that?

02:03:58.160 --> 02:03:59.160
Is it this one?

02:04:01.160 --> 02:04:02.160
Is it this one?

02:04:04.160 --> 02:04:06.160
Oh, I really wanted to do the fricking...

02:04:06.160 --> 02:04:08.160
I wanted her to be a God.

02:04:09.160 --> 02:04:10.160
But all these...

02:04:10.160 --> 02:04:13.160
I'm going to run out of time in order to...

02:04:14.160 --> 02:04:15.160
Oh, sugar.

02:04:15.160 --> 02:04:16.160
I didn't read that in time.

02:04:19.160 --> 02:04:20.160

02:04:22.160 --> 02:04:23.160

No.

02:04:35.160 --> 02:04:36.160
Wait, ego searching.

02:04:36.160 --> 02:04:38.160
Ego searching, does it?

02:04:38.160 --> 02:04:39.160

02:05:10.160 --> 02:05:11.160
