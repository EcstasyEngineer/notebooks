Live sparrow reaction🦑🛐	17880766	favorite dwarf insult "your steel is as soft as your grandfathers tool"
SleepyFenix🦑🛐	17893119	we give you attention, you give us attention
Anon Ymous	17926956	I study psychology and it's pretty fucked how early gender roles are imprinted on children's minds. little girls typically don't play games coz of this
WinkWink9000	17927906	im not lol but go on
Live sparrow reaction🦑🛐	17929481	"you're 2 picks short of a mineshaft ain't ya lad"
Momolo	17933823	women are scary, might have to stop playing videogames
InternetBasophil	17934027	Actually, now that I think about it, don't all streamers do everything for attention? Isn't that what "streaming" is?"
Hydrus-cymothoida	17934662	Gotta go folks I’ll catch the rest with Vod gang thanks for the fun Stronny!!!!!

TheBootyLord96🦑🛐	17963193	Mummeh, where is my check? This paid actor needs paying.
Odin Yakuji	17968512	@InternetBasophil Perhaps the same could be said of anyone who puts anything on the internet
HeadEmptyNoThoughts	17988974	the reality is that guys will pretend to be girls, and the girls will pretend to be guys. At least that is my experience lmao
MB BucketS	17998481	Yeah you’re lowkey just a true gamer girl with all the classic things you know
InternetBasophil	18002845	@Odin Yakuji I think we could even go further, everyone does everything for attention, praise of others, paycheck, promotion, streaming, climbing the leaderboard...

DredgenKarma🦑🛐	18493702	It’s interactions like those that prevent people from using team or match chat
InternetBasophil	18498310	It sucks, since If you play 10 games, 10 people a match, one person yelling is remembered but the 99 people are at least not confrontational. It's very unfair our brains hold on to the bad ones
