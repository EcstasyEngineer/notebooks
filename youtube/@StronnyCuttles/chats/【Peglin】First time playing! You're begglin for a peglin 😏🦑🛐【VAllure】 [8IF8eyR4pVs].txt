penguin00001	5069241	you are barely getting started
Yamata no Oroshi Kirin🔪💋	5071867	also its funny how the game mocks you with a comically large amount of gold from the pegs in this fight
Dr. King	5074057	hedge would've given us 400 more damage rn if we don't crit
Dr. King	5086143	molten mantle would eat this man alive
InternetBasophil	5086892	Stronny raiding Smaug's hoard
