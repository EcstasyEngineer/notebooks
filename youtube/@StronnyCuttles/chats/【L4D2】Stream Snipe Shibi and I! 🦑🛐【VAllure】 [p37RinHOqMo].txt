Anexi	4725530	in terms of l4d2 campaign 
DineInFor10LB MNS 188	4728792	nice now it's stuck in my head stronny
Ryan eefling	4730661	take dark carnival as the others say
Abcron	4730935	Okay :_Love:
Nihongohorni Dodemo	4731533	THE PASSING IS A DLC FROM L4D1
Anexi	4734044	the passing is dlc
InternetBasophil	4737882	They do "link" to each other, so there's one where your car runs out of gas or crashes
zeffire	4739749	it's a fantastic game
Nihongohorni Dodemo	4740898	DARK CARNIVAL IS THE NEXT ONE MUMMEH
CaptainShotgun	4744883	It's such a good game
InternetBasophil	4750008	and you see it broken down in the next map
Frederik Kristensen	4751359	There's an order if you want but not neccesary
Alevivas	4754340	Mummeh next one is dark carnival

Bernard Barr	4760546	that's why it's still loved to this day
Reefling Cuttles🦑🛐	4767831	She's talking to you mummeh
zeffire	4768706	and if you like this gameplay and vermintide gameplay, Darktide is also great
Nihongohorni Dodemo	4774652	MUMMEH DARK CARNIVAL IS THE NEXT ONE. THE PASSING IS A DLC FROM L4D1
Rain Man	4789775	The Passing is the next one, then Dark Carnival
Peanutzthepig	4795571	the passing is technically next canonically XD 
zeffire	4801309	oh man windows noise ptsd

Nero2276🦑🛐	5076579	one of the best zombie games
Peanutzthepig	5082950	this game is the GOAT :D
Nihongohorni Dodemo	5087492	Its really good yeah. Did you know theres still a competitive scene in this game.
Fiendish💔	5092643	we'll see if you keep that attitude once Versus mode begins:_Haaa:
zeffire	5093548	it might be too easy though, since this is Legendary of course
DineInFor10LB MNS 188	5101731	@Momolo true
Anexi	5102605	hehe versus 
silverthehedgehog789	5102619	development was 1 year
Axthelittle	5104849	It's because it's a Valve game 
ReluctantlySane 🦑🛐	5110357	the mechanics are easy to pickup, gunplay is great, and it switches up tanks to the director all the time
Frederik Kristensen	5114344	l4d was released aroud 07 08 so bout a year or so
Rushiryu	5115650	its actually more generous the shittier u play. more meds spawn when ur team has lower health
Nero2276🦑🛐	5116899	next time we need to play COD Zombies on BO2:_Haaa:
Anexi	5128669	well it was made along a side with the pervious game
TechnicallyAMatureAndResponsible Adult	5129133	2 cute girls would make most people nervous
GuessWhoDizIz	5130918	Sadge, i still can't seem to send a friend request 
Lalatina Ford	5133407	they probably spent a bit more on L4D1 in the previous year
kyub3y	5140415	The game aged surprisingly well.
penguin00001	5140574	Valve used to be a GREAT dev studio
Reefling Cuttles🦑🛐	5149021	Mummeh is scary. She could r-word you at anytime.
Gman Stu	5151700	Yeah ngl I was shaking when I joined and played but that's just my anxiety don't worry Mummeh I'm not scared of you :_Love::_Love:
GamingKitsune99🦑🛐 	5154595	if i talked in game and you teased me to much i might cry :_Sweat:
SleepyFenix🦑🛐	5162921	iirc, the game is programmed to push slow players along with more zombies and slow down fast players with harder enemies too.
Ryan eefling	5165369	to be fair, they had the mechanics down from left4dead and pretty much just added 2 more special infected, guns and maps
StereoRaedioVA	5166079	A lot of the game came from L4D1, L4D2 is just a better updated 1
