Not Alessandro	10071111	the follow up heavy attack from the sword power is pretty strong
Schlumpling	10078081	It’s smithscript time

Pineapple PB&J	10350816	Ah wait, you're right. No boss in the ruins = no summons
Anon Ymous	10351397	stronny put a png of gamersupps over your healing flask it would be funny

Call Me Takkun	10394342	I don't think you can summon in this place

Call Me Takkun	18590554	spirit ashes are cool but have you considered the power of unleashing reeflings on your enemies instead?
Anon Ymous	18593604	i would douse her in sweet and sour sauce and take a bite
InternetBasophil	18595476	up to her
Bonkers Bear	18604245	yeah, there's a quest to turn Dung Eater into a summon
Math1618	18604565	No, if you force him to drink Seluvius' potion
MiNopo	18604605	nah if you do a long quest you can turn him into a puppet
Obeonix [🦑🛐]	18605210	no you have to drug him and give his body to the creepy puppetfucker to get him as a summon
Dark Stranger	18605452	@Obeonix [:squid::place_of_worship:] - Fun is what should always be the primary objective. Sadly to many games have become competitive and as such a strong competitive mentality that values less fun aspects for elitist.

TI Crimson	31306632	It's hard to get the exact ending you want without looking up a guide
Ignéus	31311893	nah you've killed morgot in the base game next up is the mountain tops
Zeroh	31315627	Yeah, you now need to burn fight the Fire Giant
Ruin Desolation🦑🛐	31332854	happy i got to carry mummeh through the final boss

Obeonix [🦑🛐]	32676737	no igon 
Kap C Seekum dotGarr	32684598	:_MUMMEH:
Not Alessandro	32692568	thing is we would need to beat Malenia in case we want to revert the frenzied flame
Fenix Producer	32710095	You can get the frenzied flame, not sacrifice her, and cure it before end, but have to kill malenia
Flaming Bearded Dragon	32716767	no doing that ending locks you into it
Not Alessandro	32721610	to heal the frenzied flame you need the unalloyed needle, obtained from Millicent quest which includes killing Malenia
Obeonix [🦑🛐]	32721891	yeah you can, but you need to cure yourself which requires malenia and millicent
Not Alessandro	32723821	in a nutshell
Kuai	32750739	Melina not Malenia
Not Alessandro	32751460	Melina = Maiden
Fenix Producer	32751693	Malenia is the sister to miquella
Mango Bay	32754068	nope that's melina 
BarbeQ231	32754164	Nope, thats melina
Not Alessandro	32755712	Malenia = Blade of Miquella
Monkey	32759929	Malenia is ;Miquella's sister. 
Obeonix [🦑🛐]	32762905	you can burn yourself by collecting the flame of frenzy, then later cure yourself of frenzy and pick a different ending, but the secret ending will always play at that point as melina is alive still
Flaming Bearded Dragon	32763169	malenia the 2nd hardest boss in the game
Momolo	32763513	melina
TYes	32763932	nah, malenia its the rotten bich
Kuai	32773612	ye
Krieg Guardsman 1114	32780345	by default if you choose the frenzy flame ending you're locked out of all other endings, unless you defeats Malenia who is a hidden boss
Not Alessandro	32781724	ye lets get rotussy cheeks 
Tiny Spiny	32783790	DON'T DO IT IF YOU HAVE TO KILL YOUR MAIDEN

Kap C Seekum dotGarr	32825042	You get a new maiden with the Frenzy route though
Not Alessandro	32827654	killing Malenia blade of Miquella only if you want to avoid the frenzied flame ending

Not Alessandro	32844302	exactly like you said
Obeonix [🦑🛐]	32847445	that is correct.
Not Alessandro	32855296	the thing is Melina, your maiden, still hates you for not letting her die
WinkWink9000	32855302	melina doesnt die at all
Not Alessandro	32876229	Ranni

TYes	32903588	Ranni my beloved
Schlumpling	32905122	So sewer mohg
Obeonix [🦑🛐]	32905939	though the secret ending is like a direct tie-in to the lord of frenzy flame ending, so it will look out of place
Odin Yakuji	32908419	The one with the doll joints and 4 arms
Not Alessandro	32909684	Melina still will be fuuuumin because you saved her from burning but details
SleepyFenix🦑🛐	32911112	it works fine. Sin did it after unknowingly taking the flame so she could get Ranni end. lol
Ignéus	32912485	it's a long questline to get the needle a part of which will require a fight where you can't summon the reeflings

Krieg Guardsman 1114	39316330	I believe the needle quest is tied to Millecents quest so you'll need to go to the Erdtree-Gazing hill grace and go north to Shadowed Castle
