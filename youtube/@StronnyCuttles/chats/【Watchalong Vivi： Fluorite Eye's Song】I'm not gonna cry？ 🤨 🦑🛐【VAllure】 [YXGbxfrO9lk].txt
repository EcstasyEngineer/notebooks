Imperial Monarch	19584468	:_Headpat::_Headpat::_Headpat::_Headpat:
MB BucketS	19585793	Some ova’s have a continuation to the story and a good ending sometimes 
Grol	19599981	what a beautiful song tho, a perfect end for that Vivy, she accomplish her mission!
Green Graciano	19603027	It doesn't really solve the issue does it? Another AI/human war will probably happen again.
S.A.O.D.A.	19606716	It is what it is
InternetBasophil	19607871	It was a very interesting journey though
Abcron	19614533	I'm in shambles but I'd say that was a good time
Nero2276🦑🛐	19617014	hope you liked it:_Love:
Diddy	19618172	I guess...she's alive kind of :_Cry:
InternetBasophil	19621713	Kinda nice to have this kind of ending once in a while
ReconCrusader	19641974	they managed to finally create a world with AI that doesnt worry about this AI war happening 
S.A.O.D.A.	19644555	Don't be sad it's over, be happy it happened. Vivy will live on in our memories

MB BucketS	19652314	It was nice watching with you
Vox Et Autumn	19652640	My life's too depressing for me to watch more sad stuff. I need happy endings.
ReluctantlySane 🦑🛐	19657747	lots of feels, I'll give it a tumbs up
DredgenKarma🦑🛐	19658369	Mummeh I can’t think on it either so

WinkWink9000	19668252	so the AI needed a reset and denied rights? (or did they get their rights?) ALL HAIL THE HUMAN RACE
InternetBasophil	19669725	If you're not sure what to think it opens a lot of options to take it in different ways
ReluctantlySane 🦑🛐	19674187	:handshake:
ReconCrusader	19676632	stronny thats what happened in the after credits endings 
MB BucketS	19676732	I love watching sad ending anime for some reason
InternetBasophil	19680000	if we were cuddled up on a couch we'd be talking all our ideas
Nero2276🦑🛐	19681777	@InternetBasophil true, and also it wrapped up nicely and it will never get a season 2 and be ruined, like it happened to sooo many anime
SleepyFenix🦑🛐	19688060	It's a bitter sweet ending. She succeeded, but at the cost of her own life.
Steve	19688135	yea, but I gotta wash them then use hand sanitizer
ReconCrusader	19692134	humans and AI found a way to live in harmony without the fear of AI war 
Kartoffel Of Doom	19709043	would you rather it end in the episode 12?
S.A.O.D.A.	19724504	Yeah, she existed with short hair after all
HeadEmptyNoThoughts	19724865	the anime was great but the whole thing happening because the mainframe just evolved to believe they were better is kinda lame
Nightshade Lemonade 🩹	19731683	you should write a strongly worded letter to the writer
ReluctantlySane 🦑🛐	19733038	probably need to sleep on it
ReconCrusader	19735506	:_Huggies::_Huggies::_Huggies: she doesnt remember the 100 years anymore

InternetBasophil	19761824	So, as a "make me a weeb" choice I think this is very good, because this sort of thing is something anime does excel at, is take you through an insane wild journey and have you somewhat haunted
ReconCrusader	19766365	reschedule chess to another time :_Headpat: you want us to recommend happy comedies and stuff in maros now? 
Nero2276🦑🛐	19767714	that's ok, take your time mummeh:_Love:

S.A.O.D.A.	19799347	That's the sign of a good ending
Abcron	19808741	You said "I need to sleep on it" last time too lol
ReconCrusader	19809004	:_Haaa:
askterix_	19816096	but yeah the story is very terminator-esque
Kartoffel Of Doom	19817951	mummeh needs rest.
Nightshade Lemonade 🩹	19831995	maybe another string cheese will fix it
MB BucketS	19832260	Here’s some advice to cheer you up. She’s a robot therefore her memories and life can be carried on and live eternally
HeadEmptyNoThoughts	19836912	we can watch a funny or ecchi anime next time
SleepyFenix🦑🛐	19839393	We couldn't get a art idea out of it either. :_MUMMEH:
S.A.O.D.A.	19843212	Technically there's no rule against it
InternetBasophil	19847229	You should try Keigo
ReluctantlySane 🦑🛐	19848484	lol
Vox Et Autumn	19850628	Made an absolute lie out of the stream title.
InternetBasophil	19855536	it's right up your alley and wildly silly

Abcron	19880861	Every other episode yeah lol
SleepyFenix🦑🛐	19886561	She needs something silly and fanservicey next time.
ReconCrusader	19894427	we warned you and you thought you were safe from greetin' because we warned you :_Point::_Point::_Point:
Kartoffel Of Doom	19897510	what made you cry the most in these 13 episodes?
InternetBasophil	19899238	It's literally a sports anime about booty bouncing each other off water platforms 
Boi	19904389	the music was so good :_GlowSticks:

Nero2276🦑🛐	19947317	the crazy part is that when Vivy came out many people skipped it cause they saw the "musical" tag and thought it was gonna be the usual musical anime
