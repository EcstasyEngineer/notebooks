1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,000
What is that noise? It sounds like the fire. Oh, there we go.

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Oh, he's like, this world is free.

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Whoa, this is too loud.

4
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
3 A believes it.

5
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Brave.

6
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Obviously, I've jumped into the game.

7
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Oh, wait a minute.

8
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Oh, wait, can I hear myself?

9
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
I can't hear myself.

10
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Get the oof.

11
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
What am I?

12
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Mommy's here.

13
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:03,000
I'm going to open it.

14
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Hi, good morning. Good evening.

15
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Good afternoon.

16
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:17,000
How is that all fit to scale?

17
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Oh wait, that doesn't fit to scale at all, Roonlight.

18
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Was that like that last stream?

19
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:29,000
It doesn't. Wait, why is this on top of the freaking thing?

20
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
No, don't do that. That's even worse.

21
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Go below.

22
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Why is there two Roonlight?

23
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Is it the game capture's nice and loud?

24
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Okay, no, that looks correct. I just need to do that.

25
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Okay, Rinscape's just a funny-shaped game, okay?

26
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
It's going to be scoff.

27
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
It's just a funny-shaped game.

28
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,000
I'm too dumb for to figure out.

29
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Is that a reflin?

30
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Reflin, you're already in?

31
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Other player has accepted?

32
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Okay.

33
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
I'm like, that's a reflin, you're quick.

34
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
We are in World High...

35
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Oh, it's replays.

36
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Hi, Red E. Blink.

37
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
That's how I spell it.

38
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Damn, reflins are shown off.

39
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
I'm not even freaking set.

40
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Oh, this is my update for today.

41
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
No way, they have freaking Gangnam style

42
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
and freaking Rinscape 07.

43
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Old school.

44
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
I don't know why I said 07 though.

45
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Oh, my Gangnam style.

46
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Sexy reflin.

47
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

48
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Gangnam style.

49
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Howdy-ow.

50
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Good morning, good evening, and good after noon.

51
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:53,000
I hope you guys are ready for a cheeky endurance stream.

52
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Hi, reflings.

53
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Hi, Strawny, I guess.

54
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Yeah, I hope you're ready for a cheeky endurance today.

55
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:06,000
I had a bit of business going on behind the scenes,

56
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
business, business, business,

57
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,000
so I hope to have quite a fun update soon.

58
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
I've just told the girls what the business was,

59
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
and someone's very excited.

60
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
I just read their message,

61
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
but I can't say or else spoilers.

62
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Let me open up my inventory so you guys can see what's up.

63
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Yes, we are business, business, business.

64
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Honestly, it feels really weird doing straight-up business, business, business.

65
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:40,000
The only thing I'm used to is sponsorship people reaching out to me

66
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
and being like, hey, for a 60-second segment,

67
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
I will pay you this much.

68
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
This is what is going on.

69
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
And then I'm just like...

70
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
I can't.

71
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:56,000
But this time I got...

72
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
I will talk about it a bit more.

73
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
I'm going to ask permission if I can talk about it

74
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:06,000
because the person is associated with an agency that helped out to...

75
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
And if they're comfortable with it,

76
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
I'm happy to talk about it.

77
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Obviously, nothing.

78
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Azur got monetized?

79
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Are you telling me Azur got monetized?

80
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
I went to bed and Azur wasn't monetized.

81
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Sheevee was, which made me think within 24 hours Azur is getting reviewed next.

82
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,000
I just hope her massive fucking honkers don't...

83
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
I know Denpa isn't in here right now.

84
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Denpa's just messaged me.

85
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
She's...

86
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Sean, I know you have a lot on your plate.

87
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Do you think AceMars is?

88
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
What do you need Denpa?

89
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
I won't charge.

90
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Denpa...

91
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
I won't charge, darling.

92
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Oh Denpa, you're so adorable.

93
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Never charge friends.

94
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Always do it for free because when you have friends like these,

95
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
life is good.

96
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,000
I have not even known Denpa for more than two weeks

97
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
and she's been nothing but a sweetheart to me.

98
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Right, I am going to go to the bank and clear out all my fissies in the background

99
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
whilst I ramble to yours.

100
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
I have absolutely terrible news.

101
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Just upshotting news.

102
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
I tried to take a Jobay,

103
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
but the Jobay wouldn't have come.

104
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:28,000
So I'm probably going to have to take a big steamer in the middle of the stream,

105
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,000
which I'm raging because I hate...

106
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Right, I don't...

107
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,000
I'll always go for a shower after I do a big Jobay

108
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
because I can't...

109
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Wait, should I just make a...

110
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
I think it would actually be faster.

111
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Hold on, Refluence.

112
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,000
I think it's going to be faster if I take wood out and...

113
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Do I even have wood?

114
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Do I even have an axe?

115
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
It must...

116
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
I do have an axe.

117
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Okay, then I need a tinderbox.

118
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Okay.

119
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
I don't actually have a bit of wood.

120
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Right, that's fine though.

121
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
We're going to go get it.

122
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Right, we'll chop here and then I'm going to make a fire outside the bank for now

123
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
and eliminate all of my inventory.

124
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Oh, tiny cuttles wants to trade with you.

125
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
What's your name?

126
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Little baby cuttles.

127
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Hi.

128
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Oh, you already given me one.

129
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Thank you.

130
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Yes, I will be needing these.

131
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Thank you very much.

132
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,000
The best way to ruin friendship is to get money involved.

133
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:43,000
I went until you learned about the development team drama.

134
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Oh my God!

135
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
I've got a really funny fucking comment.

136
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,000
So, you know how I'm always telling you about like,

137
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:54,000
all I have on hand for wood right now,

138
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,000
your wood is more than enough.

139
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Little Refling, I assure you.

140
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
A winky face, because we all know what we're talking about.

141
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
I'm a mod.

142
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Oh, damn, bullshit!

143
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
I was talking about you.

144
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
I'm so scared.

145
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
I never streamed on YouTube.

146
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Oh, you don't actually have to mod anything.

147
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,000
It's like customary to make you a mod

148
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:26,000
so that you stand out more in chat.

149
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
DEMPA, I'm so sorry.

150
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
I was just exposing you.

151
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,000
I just said that you wanted an ASMR script

152
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
and I'm offering it for free

153
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
because I would never charge you for that.

154
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
You're freaking sick of just not...

155
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Wait, wait, wait.

156
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Let me pick up...

157
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
I'm doing two things.

158
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Right, let me finish up the...

159
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Why did that only take out one?

160
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Oh, it's not looking good.

161
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Now you all know that I'm a RuneScape noob.

162
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Oh yeah, YouTube custom.

163
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Yes, you're learning right.

164
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Use Tinder box on the logs.

165
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Oh my God, you got a little cabbage head going on.

166
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Okay, right.

167
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Oh, I don't want to brag but I'm leveled to a fire making.

168
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Right, we are going to just get rid of...

169
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Not rid of, but...

170
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
But yeah, you don't...

171
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Yeah, so as I was saying,

172
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,000
we got a little hate comment today on YouTube

173
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,000
but do you want to know why it's so funny?

174
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,000
It's because most of the comments were like,

175
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,000
vealers aren't going to last a month.

176
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,000
And then it went to two months and it went to six months.

177
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Do you want to know what today's hate comment and quotation marks was

178
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
that I had to delete?

179
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Vealers aren't going to last two years.

180
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Motherfucker, if vealers last two years,

181
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,000
all three generations are successfully out.

182
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
I don't...

183
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
What?

184
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Are you dumb?

185
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
I like how it went from not even going to last a week,

186
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
not even going to last a month.

187
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Two years?

188
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Two years, all three gents are out.

189
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Vealers and I have succeeded in what I wanted to do.

190
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Literally just multiplied the time dramatically.

191
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
And literally, it's a supportive message.

192
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
I'm like, nice try, but...

193
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Wait, sorry, I think a reflim was trying to trade me.

194
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Sorry, sorry.

195
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,000
I'm sorry, Brov, yet it didn't mean to not trade you.

196
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
What?

197
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
10,000 swordfish?

198
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Isn't that not like 99 right there?

199
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Am I going crazy?

200
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Are you sure?

201
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Oh my god!

202
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Oh my god!

203
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Wait, wait, wait, another reflim?

204
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Oh no.

205
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Oh my god, reflim.

206
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Alright, I'm getting drunk.

207
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
I'm getting drunk as a skunk.

208
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Actually,

209
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:48,000
I think we're doing drunk stream near the end.

210
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Helps make the job happen.

211
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
I literally got like,

212
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
freaking 10 kabillion.

213
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Right, thank you, let's go for a job.

214
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Let me drink that, let me eat.

215
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Oh, love the little bubble sound effect.

216
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
If I ever make a song, like an actual song,

217
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
like a custom made song,

218
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
oh my god, 10,000 swordfish.

219
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Oh my gosh.

220
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Right, in order

221
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
to make this super simple,

222
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
I'm so sorry for anyone who like,

223
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,000
is really good at organizing their shit.

224
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
I'm not.

225
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
I'm literally just going to shove

226
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
all the fish items to the top.

227
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Please don't judge me.

228
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Please don't judge me.

229
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Right, I'm pretty sure that's all the shit.

230
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Raw trout, you as well.

231
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Raw herring, you as well.

232
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
And that's cooked salmon.

233
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Oh god, what a bank.

234
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Gee, gee, willikers, I sure hope no one

235
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
cracks into a skullfish.

236
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
I think members later, it'll get faster.

237
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
One morban, literally.

238
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Right, shrimp, we're going to cook

239
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
all the shrimp right now.

240
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Unless the fire is out, I think the fire is out.

241
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Okay, wait, no, someone's lighting the beacon.

242
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Gondor calls for aid.

243
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
We're just going to clean up our inventory.

244
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
I say that as if we didn't just get 10,000

245
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
freaking fish, thank you very much.

246
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Desme, I'm glad I could help, thank you.

247
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Bank tabs and shambles, I'm so sorry.

248
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
I know people are really good at like,

249
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
organizing their tabs.

250
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
I just couldn't, I'm just like, in and out, let's go.

251
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
She's a hoarder.

252
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
But she's our hoarder.

253
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Vsucky is done for.

254
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
They can't compete with Vila,

255
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
literally.

256
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
I bet you Vila won't last until

257
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Vila's stuff exists then.

258
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Isn't it interesting?

259
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
It's cooking me right now.

260
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Well, you might only last two years,

261
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
but that's still a year.

262
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
22 months, 30 days,

263
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
23 hours,

264
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
59 minutes and 59

265
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
seconds longer than he probably lasts

266
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
when he touches a woman.

267
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Bro, literally, oh wait,

268
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
whoa, whoa, whoa, wait, did you just,

269
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
did you just roast him?

270
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Thank you for the tip, Toria.

271
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
I was like, oh yeah, yeah, yeah, until you

272
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
I heard the very last sentence.

273
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
I was like, Brian?

274
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Brian?

275
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Oh my gosh.

276
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
That was,

277
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
I didn't expect that at all.

278
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
I can put this away because there's a kind

279
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
reflin makin' fires, right?

280
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
We'll do anchovies, we'll do

281
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
the...

282
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
No, don't eat.

283
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Oh wait, they're cooked.

284
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
My apologies, such a fake

285
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
gamer, for I cannot hide.

286
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Oh my god, reflies are like starting a

287
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
frickin' fire outside the bank.

288
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Wait a minute, I'm not the rock

289
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
well uprising.

290
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
I was naughty.

291
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
I'm not there all the time.

292
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
I'm just, I'll put my hand up

293
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
and I'll say I'm not there all the time.

294
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
I had a little peek yesterday

295
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
about what you've all been

296
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
anonymously chatting about

297
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
and someone said,

298
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
yes, Johnny, I understand

299
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Blackwell

300
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
headquarters.

301
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
And I was like, ah,

302
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
that's so fuckin' funny.

303
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
So yeah, your comment got me excited.

304
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
I just seen someone,

305
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
someone's like ritual posting

306
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
about Shoebe and it's like, I am nothing but trash.

307
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Under Shoebe's foot and I'm like, yes, yes, yes.

308
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Then the OG

309
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Sands, I was checking the OG Sands out.

310
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
They were spoiling, I see.

311
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Absolutely spoiling it. Hey, Johnny, off topic question.

312
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
What's your tip

313
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
for Germany, Scotland today?

314
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Is there a football match on?

315
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Use logs on fire to make

316
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
bonfire, we'll not go out.

317
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Isn't that all RuneScape 3?

318
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
I don't think that's a thing here.

319
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
What about having

320
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
many fires?

321
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Any thoughts on doing an Iron Man

322
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
so chat can't just give you everything?

323
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
V-Bop

324
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
you have far too much

325
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
faith in me. I'm not even going to pretend otherwise.

326
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
I know I'm not

327
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
supposed to name chatters,

328
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
but my guy,

329
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
you have far too much faith in me to think that I could do.

330
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
The only way I could do this on my own

331
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
is by picking up

332
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
dropped fish in Barbarian Village.

333
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
That is the only way I know how to do it.

334
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Because I don't have the funds.

335
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
I don't know how to make money in this game.

336
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
And we'd be at this for hours.

337
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Squidding me right now.

338
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Since

339
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
strong debut, something about her reminded me

340
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
of a Pokémon.

341
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
It has been on the tip of my tongue for an entire week.

342
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
And I finally figured it looks

343
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
like a Cray Dilly if it was an anime girl.

344
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
A Cray Dilly? Hold on.

345
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
You're actually getting me a look up something.

346
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
A Cray Dilly Pokémon.

347
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Oh!

348
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
I know them. They're in Groovy.

349
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Kill things to make money.

350
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Kill go-

351
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Bro, goblins don't drop money.

352
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
The most expensive item

353
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
goblins drop is Goblin Mail,

354
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
which is 500 a piece purely because it's a quest item.

355
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Thank you, Thierry, for the other tip as well.

356
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Honestly, I could see that.

357
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Yeah, the fossil type.

358
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Goblins are the best.

359
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
You're trolling me.

360
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
I'm getting trolled.

361
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
There's no way you guys actually think that.

362
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
I got my first Bond via marbles on stream.

363
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
I wish you could do marbles on stream

364
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
on

365
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
thingy.

366
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
On YouTube.

367
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
But things are very slowly getting

368
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
integrated to YouTube.

369
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
But I

370
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
I definitely feel YouTube

371
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
is becoming stronger and stronger

372
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
for streamers.

373
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
And like

374
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
I think what we're saying

375
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
that discoverability

376
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
who dare at

377
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
DEMPO

378
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
I don't know if you're still lurking.

379
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
DEMPO goes, I didn't think that far ahead.

380
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
What do you think would be cute? I think she likes the kind of

381
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
creepier it is. I'll write some creepy stuff.

382
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
You were strong, we were rooting for Scotland today

383
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
for years. Oh, we're going to do shite.

384
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
But it's fine. It's fine.

385
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
The life of a Scottish

386
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
national

387
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Wait, no, hold on. Nationality of a Scottish person.

388
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Because we understand we're just terrible.

389
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Although we're decent at rugby

390
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
I'll be honest, we're actually no rough at rugby.

391
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
But the fit ball

392
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
The fit ball, if you didn't know

393
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
and to say football

394
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
in Scotland, you say fit

395
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
like FIT. But no pronunciation

396
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
on the T. And then ball.

397
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
How?

398
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
I'm okay with that.

399
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
I feel like

400
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
YouTube could make discoverability so much better.

401
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
See, I think it does

402
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
enough. It's Twitch that has poor

403
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
discoverability. However,

404
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
people disagree with me when I say that.

405
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
And I'm like, oh, okay.

406
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
I actually thought

407
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Shawnee literally never leaves

408
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
her arms until she may.

409
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
I just believe.

410
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Bond lid, thank you for

411
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
coming. I remember.

412
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Enjoy the emotes back.

413
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
The girls emotes have been ordered.

414
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
I do have a bit of bad news

415
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
about it though. The person

416
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
that I get them done by, they're like

417
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
it'll take me a month. And I'm like

418
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
excuse me?

419
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
A month? And they're like, yeah, a month.

420
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
Is that okay? And I'm like, I guess.

421
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
And then

422
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
they're like, oh, but

423
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
we've also put the base price up. And I'm like, oh,

424
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
okay then.

425
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
Okay, that's fine then.

426
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
And I'm like, okay,

427
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
that's just kind of the worst of all worlds.

428
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
But yeah, everyone else

429
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
is going to get emotes before me.

430
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
I'm submitting everyone else's emotes before me

431
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
because I don't think it's fair.

432
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
My reeflings, you know how

433
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
unbelievably well

434
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
behaved you are for me and how patient.

435
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
And it's nicer for the girls

436
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
to have something to celebrate

437
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
because you already know I'm going to be

438
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
here every day.

439
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
Oh, I was saying

440
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
that my first drunk stream

441
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
I'm not sure how much people

442
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
are going to like this. And I can already see

443
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
some of you typing and rolling your

444
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
eyes. Keep your eyes to the

445
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
front of your head. I don't want one eye

446
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
rolling to the back of the skull.

447
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
What was I saying?

448
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
My first drunk

449
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
stream was going to be

450
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
a

451
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
drunk apex, but I don't go

452
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
offline until we win.

453
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
But, okay.

454
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
How did you time that?

455
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
There's a stream delay. How did you

456
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
even time that?

457
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Fucking reefling in game said

458
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
eye roll. How did you time that?

459
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
A 30

460
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
hour stream. Oh, I thought that.

461
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
But then I was like, would you guys rather

462
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
jellybean game? Some sort of drunk

463
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
multiplayer game.

464
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
So the stream is just never going to end, pretty much.

465
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
Apex. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

466
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
Everyone is like dunking on apex.

467
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
Well, there's other multiplayer games

468
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
we can play if you'd rather drunk

469
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
that. But I feel like drunk jellybean

470
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
is just going to be me like

471
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
please, please

472
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
please let me, let me

473
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
get to the past and first level

474
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
please

475
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
I don't want to spectate.

476
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
And I'll be drunk and hold up.

477
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
Why is so much fire? You had drunk

478
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
runes. How is drunk runescape fun?

479
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
I put the

480
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
shrimp on the

481
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
fire.

482
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
It cooks the shrimp

483
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
and my level

484
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
gets higher.

485
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
Drunk fire cave.

486
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
Oh, got drunk.

487
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
Accidentally achieved 99

488
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
fletching.

489
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
Runescape is never fun.

490
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
You drink every time you make an alcoholic

491
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
drink.

492
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
Don't let you get past level one

493
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
this time around.

494
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
That's what I'm worried about

495
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
the true endurance stream for real

496
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
for real. Well bank the bank

497
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
runescape is a job

498
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
but honestly, that's funny.

499
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
Oh wait, no, that's kik chuna

500
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
but you're unkik

501
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
true herring.

502
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
Castle wars is

503
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
for you play. Hydration, I need

504
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
to finish my tea.

505
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
Which

506
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
yes

507
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
I

508
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
I've

509
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
also planned out

510
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
the membership

511
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
streams for next week. Again

512
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
if you are unable to member, please don't

513
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
worry.

514
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
Dear little reeflings, I stream

515
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
every single day free access.

516
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
What movie did I pick?

517
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
I think I might have picked

518
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
Austin Powers

519
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
for the movie

520
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
question mark. How are you keeping this

521
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
up?

522
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
I don't know. I thought you could only have one

523
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
or she'll start leaking secret.

524
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
No, I shut off about all the insider

525
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
stuff now. I'm starting to leak it.

526
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
Well, I've not said anything that I've

527
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
regret saying. I don't

528
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
regret being like, yeah, we

529
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
don't need talent managers

530
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
because it turns out if you give

531
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
it a try.

532
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
Actually, I would like to expand upon that

533
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
point. Now that you've got me on that

534
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
subject, hold on a minute little reefling.

535
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
The reason why talent

536
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
managers aren't necessarily needed

537
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
is because these girls have streamed

538
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
and they have plenty of experience.

539
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
Who goes there?

540
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
And

541
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
to

542
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
go from independent

543
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
where you pick your streams and you pick

544
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
everything and then you're on a one week

545
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
interval every week to stream what you want.

546
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
It just doesn't make sense or it doesn't make

547
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
sense to me, okay?

548
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
So, yeah.

549
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
Sad I'm going to miss the first membership stream.

550
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
I mean, you can always go back and watch the VODs.

551
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
At any point you become

552
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
a member, you can access the VODs

553
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
on the membership

554
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
strums. I just need to

555
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
once I make

556
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
the lobbies for them,

557
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
I just need to make sure I do it for the correct

558
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
membership here.

559
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
Holy crap, we're creeping on the next level.

560
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
I actually don't know what level we are.

561
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
We're level 52. We're about to be

562
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
53. We're slowly creeping

563
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
up.

564
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
Wait, are they flirting? What's going on here?

565
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
Agility. Construction

566
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
and slayer.

567
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
Oh, we're all debating on what... I thought

568
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
runecrafting was unanimously voted the worst.

569
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
It's

570
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
stressful with a manager.

571
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
I just feel very strongly

572
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
that

573
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
I mean, obviously in my instance

574
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
the girls in that are happy for me

575
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
to say all of them streamed way longer

576
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
than me. Why would they need to come

577
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
to me for permission to stream?

578
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
It just seems rather odd,

579
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
you know?

580
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
It just doesn't make any sense.

581
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
Mooncrafting has

582
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
a minigame now. Oh, to make it faster?

583
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
I'm thinking of how many watch hours I need

584
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
to pack up when I get home though. Honestly though...

585
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
I've planned out

586
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
the

587
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
Elden Ring streams

588
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
but

589
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
I just realised I might have to delay it by a day

590
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
because of time zones. I don't know

591
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
if the DLC has a time zone release

592
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
but from being

593
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
an upside down land

594
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
whenever there's an ad for a game

595
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
and it's like, this game comes out on this day

596
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
and I'm like, well that's a lie

597
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
because it's not time synced

598
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
because I'm in the future, right now I'm in the future

599
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
it's 4am on the 15th

600
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
like I'm in the future, you know?

601
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
So I might have accidentally planned

602
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
my Elden Ring stream a day too early

603
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
before the DLC comes out

604
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
but then again

605
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
we could play it

606
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
early. Actually, no

607
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
there's not going to be a problem

608
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
with being able to be at the DLC anyway

609
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
because we're starting fresh

610
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
How's the future?

611
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
I mean

612
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
it's alright

613
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
I ain't got much of a quarrel with it

614
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
That's a lot of marks of grace

615
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
yes, that's going to be

616
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
a major endurance stream

617
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
back to back

618
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
I've planned 4 days

619
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
around it

620
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
it might leak into a 5th day

621
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
but I'm sorry to anyone watching that

622
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
Elden Ring isn't your thing

623
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
you know?

624
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
Arise, you tarnish

625
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
Do you have a save file ready?

626
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
No, I was going to start fresh

627
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
I was going to start from the beginning

628
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
yeah, because I like when you guys get to

629
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
hold my hand

630
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
through the stream

631
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
and someone said a marshmallow

632
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
and I was like, can we invade?

633
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
and I'm like, that's actually what we do

634
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
and then one reekling comes in

635
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
as an invader or enemy

636
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
and it means we can safely walk around

637
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
the areas and stuff

638
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
I didn't know if I should bring out the shock caller

639
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
so every time I perish

640
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
you guys get to shock me

641
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
I don't know if that's a bit too weird though

642
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
for what we're...

643
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
I feel like it's more going to be like nostalgia run

644
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
of all of us being like, I remember this

645
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
I remember that, I remember when we did this

646
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
remember when we did that

647
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
and then I've just got a shock caller going

648
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
every time

649
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
every time I mess up

650
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
I will probably be on here rinsking

651
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
during that, oh I need to finish my tea

652
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
I've been making my teas

653
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
with far too much honey, it's rubbish

654
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
alcohol poisoning

655
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
no, I cannot

656
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
drink and play rinsking

657
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
Elden Ring, there's no chance of that

658
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
the shock caller

659
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
is with Sin, I actually need to message her

660
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
because unfortunately

661
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
I need to delay that stream due to

662
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
obligations

663
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
because essentially week 3

664
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
is Elden Ring and then it would be week 4

665
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
Elden Ring with Sin and

666
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
I think that would

667
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
alienate

668
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
too many

669
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
supporters being like, oh god

670
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
get off that game already

671
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
you can do it, don't let

672
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
you get in the way

673
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
don't let yourself get in the way

674
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
honestly

675
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
I do have a fun update for those of you

676
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
who enjoy seeing my hands

677
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
I have successfully ordered

678
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000
the Uwu Market

679
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
keychains

680
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
and merchandise

681
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
I bought my own merchandise

682
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
but I got a discount code and all that

683
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
I've got the keychains

684
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
of all the girls coming

685
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
so I'm going to do

686
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
a little hand ASMR soon

687
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
for anyone

688
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
now don't worry this content

689
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
will be made public that I'm about to discuss

690
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
for anyone who is currently on

691
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
Patreon

692
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
they got early access to

693
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
a YouTube video

694
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
which was absolutely outrageous

695
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
but I'm just wanting to know

696
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
if anyone in chat did

697
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
listen to that outrageous

698
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
audio and what were your thoughts about it

699
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
I'm also using my Patreon

700
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
as a big

701
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
archive of anything that I produce

702
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,000
sadly

703
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
four audios are unable to be

704
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
uploaded to it because I was

705
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
very dumb

706
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
I've made a four part

707
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
series

708
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
that has hypnosis in it

709
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
but Patreon actually doesn't allow

710
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
that so I'm going

711
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
to upload it on my alt

712
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
twitter for free not a problem

713
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
I just need to edit it and get out the way

714
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
but it means

715
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
I'm now missing four audios

716
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
raw tuna

717
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
that's cooked that's cooked that's cooked

718
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,000
that's cooked so lobster

719
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
tuna and then we tackle the

720
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
10k freaking

721
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
sword fish

722
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
this is going to be interesting

723
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
I keep running out of love

724
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
are the hoodies

725
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
no nothing is

726
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
limited by ubu market

727
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
actually I need to talk to them

728
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
again because

729
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
Azura is coming up

730
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
y'all

731
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
why does he not like hypnosis

732
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
Mastercard our

733
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
unloved overlords

734
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
have deemed that hypnosis

735
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
is in

736
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
consensual for some reason

737
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
even though it fully is like you will never do

738
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
something that you don't want to do

739
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
and unfortunately

740
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
Patreon always have to bend the knee

741
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
a lot of people have issues with Patreon

742
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
but the reality of the situation is

743
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,000
our overlords that we despise

744
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
the ones who are on Epstein island

745
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
all the time but

746
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
deem hypnosis as non consensual

747
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
so it cannot be

748
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
uploaded to Patreon however

749
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
for some

750
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
I'm going to say something and this is a bit controversial

751
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
but guess what

752
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
Elon Musk announced that Twitter is absolutely

753
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
fine with that kind of content

754
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
so I'm sorry but one up on Elon Musk

755
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
because he couldn't give less of a rat's arse

756
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
and to be honest

757
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
that's kind of what I'm looking for when it comes to

758
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
just making content

759
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
we're all adults here we're all doing our thing

760
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
like there's no need

761
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
for all these things going on

762
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
but yeah

763
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
so unfortunately

764
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,000
it means I have four missing

765
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
oh I shouldn't say those words

766
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
sorry four inkable audios

767
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
so I need to go

768
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
record so

769
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
I'm not actually sure what my fourth upload

770
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
this month is going to be on Patreon

771
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
because

772
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
originally it was supposed to be

773
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
part one of the series

774
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
but it's not possible

775
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
but yeah did you like the audio

776
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
for those of you who are on Patreon

777
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
because it was absolutely outrageous

778
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
you can probably monetize Twitter eventually

779
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
oh you need five million

780
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
impressions I'm not sure we're there

781
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
unless like well she

782
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
stirs

783
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
and Mercy

784
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
can't get caught in the algorithm

785
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
when

786
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
this new meta came up

787
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
so they actually probably do

788
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
have that

789
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
but

790
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
yeah like

791
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
if Twitter is like yeah this is

792
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
four I've burnt all of them

793
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
I have five

794
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
lobbies out of that that's terrible

795
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
that was a really rough run right lobbies

796
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
we've got 500 let's see

797
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
how much we just absolutely

798
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
waste honestly

799
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
we'll do

800
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
it was very unhinged the ASMR

801
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
yeah I thought it was hilarious

802
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
I was like freaking jumping around

803
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
the mic

804
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
I was doing like backflips trying to come over

805
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
and like get it louder and stuff

806
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,000
do you know how many I put so many

807
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
like noise dampening filters

808
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
on the audio as well

809
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
but the clap was so loud

810
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
it was outrageous

811
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
um

812
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
I don't know if it'll survive on YouTube

813
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
but I'll still upload it as a YOLO anyway

814
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,000
because it's hilarious and I don't care

815
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
and to be honest I never really

816
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
did anything that outrageous because it's just

817
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
sound like to me it's like just

818
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
the sound of someone clapping their hands okay

819
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
it's just what's actually happening

820
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
that's a bit outrageous but because

821
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
there's no audio it's fine

822
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
so because there's no visual

823
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
unhinged isn't a negative thing

824
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
Sony the audio is the reason

825
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
I'll have to

826
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
go stuff to see the 7th grade

827
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
yeah basically

828
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
I did clapping ASMR

829
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
but I didn't use my hands

830
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
hmm

831
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
I want her

832
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
well I'm gonna see if I can get some fish

833
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,000
I don't need any more fish if it's for me

834
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,000
I'm sure you've got 10k swordfish

835
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
um but yeah

836
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
that's the audio I made

837
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
oh my god

838
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
we've almost leveled up again

839
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
54

840
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
that's fantastic

841
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
what a genius entrepreneur truly

842
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
I've turned

843
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
I fell asleep to the begging one

844
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
really?

845
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
that got so popular

846
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
I'm like I definitely hit the algorithm

847
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
because

848
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
well someone said on one of my

849
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
ASMR stream

850
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
wait what happened there

851
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
someone said on my ASMR stream

852
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
that

853
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
I was on tiktok feature

854
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
page

855
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
but Vailer doesn't upload

856
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
to tiktok we've reserved everyone's name

857
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,000
on tiktok just in case

858
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
but it's more important

859
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
to do youtube shorts vs tiktok

860
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
like over that kind of thing

861
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
um

862
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000
what liquid you put on your

863
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000
not hands I heard you spree something at the beginning

864
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
oh it's coconut oil

865
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,000
it's oil

866
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
in the audio like literally in the audio

867
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
you can hear me take off my prel

868
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000
I left that in on purpose

869
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
because I breathed

870
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
like heavily through it and I was like

871
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
I'll edit this out but then I was like

872
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
oh maybe someone would enjoy it

873
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
so I just left it in so you can literally

874
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,000
hear me take off my weapon drew

875
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
and armour

876
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
nudge nudge

877
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
tiktok clippers

878
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
no like so on tiktok

879
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,000
it's called

880
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
a video format is called tiktok

881
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,000
where's youtube it's called the short

882
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,000
and twitch it's a clip

883
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,000
but it's all the same thing

884
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
oh I leveled up I got 54

885
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
oh my gosh

886
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
maybe 70 is gonna be like

887
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,000
way before like at the rate we're

888
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,000
doing these lobbies

889
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,000
um

890
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
my beloved

891
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
thank you

892
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000
oh my god that voice crack

893
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,000
70 is fast yeah I feel like maybe

894
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,000
I might have

895
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
underestimated how much we're gonna get

896
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
the little extra sounds add a lot

897
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
oh right so I can actually tell you

898
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
the behind the scenes of recording the coconut clapping

899
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
let's call it the coconut clapping

900
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
that'll be our code word for it

901
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
um

902
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
the reason why you hear me go

903
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
oh and then

904
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,000
I do it is because I had to hold on

905
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
to my

906
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
my gooblies because they were

907
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
bumping

908
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,000
and jumping because of like

909
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
in order to make

910
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,000
um your buns of steel

911
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,000
clap you have to like go up and down

912
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,000
quite not violently

913
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,000
but you have to make it quite fast that's something

914
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
sometimes I do it slowly and then sometimes

915
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
it's like one after

916
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,000
I'd clap that coconut I mean what

917
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
the cool thing is

918
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000
that you can fully unleash the Scottish accent

919
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000
doesn't mean it tastes like coconut

920
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
I mean right now probably

921
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
oh I should do that smell trend

922
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,000
I keep forgetting coconut clapping

923
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,000
like 1 to 5 of them

924
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
if you cook at a range next door you're burned

925
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
I can't be bothered moving though

926
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,000
I want to stay with my reef limbs at the fire

927
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000
I was gone for 5 just strong

928
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
he died no I'm level

929
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
54

930
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,000
I just came to realise I've probably

931
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,000
severely underestimated that we're

932
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,000
achieved 70s this stream

933
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
we are most likely going to have

934
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,000
a lot more than that

935
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
um

936
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
aggressively clapping coconut

937
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,000
well at one minute I was like I feel like

938
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,000
um saw

939
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
I think I said saw but what I meant was

940
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,000
jaws that shark like that

941
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,000
because I was away I went

942
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,000
walked further away from the microphone

943
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
and then came closer and it was like

944
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,000
ding ding ding clap clap

945
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,000
ding ding ding clap clap clap clap clap

946
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,000
it's one of the most

947
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
ridiculous audios I've ever made but

948
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
I got halfway

949
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
through editing my

950
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
first

951
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,000
1k thank you

952
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
oh wait I've got salmon sugar

953
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000
I didn't notice that salmon there wait I'll finish

954
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,000
off the salmon

955
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,000
um

956
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,000
I got halfway through

957
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,000
finishing my first like 1000

958
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
special ASMR and it's just

959
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,000
me rambling

960
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,000
and doing tingles it honestly

961
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
probably feels like a live stream like when I

962
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,000
just start rambling whilst I'm doing tingles

963
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,000
but like I was having so much fun

964
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,000
like um being like

965
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,000
guess what this is oh my god

966
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
this is actually a sponge I don't know if you could

967
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,000
guess that type thing like I was just getting

968
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,000
so excited so it doesn't sound

969
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,000
like ASMR again

970
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,000
from the aster

971
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
tuber

972
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
like 92 is halfway to 99

973
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
XP wise okay

974
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,000
oh dear lord

975
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,000
this is going to take a little cheeky while

976
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,000
um hi

977
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,000
hello thank you for joining

978
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,000

979
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,000
hmm

980
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,000
well I wanted to try and finish it in this

981
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,000
month because I had on week

982
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
4 I had 2 back to back

983
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,000
runescape and I picked

984
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
the movies I'm like 99%

985
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000
sure we're doing John Wick

986
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
all of John Wick

987
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,000
series

988
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
um

989
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,000
if I burnt a singular

990
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,000
salmon

991
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,000
we'll do all of

992
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,000
John Wick

993
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,000
month long cooking stream honestly

994
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,000

I'm freaking hilarious

1001
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,000
like you could hear me

1002
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,000

1003
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,000
oh thank you for the super chat

1004
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
your boy Stephen Adams

1005
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,000
holo n fan

1006
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,000
what do you mean

1007
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,000
b-boys in your favorite holo n

1008
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,000
the way she was going to call her fan page

1009
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,000
bebelpales was hilarious

1010
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
I can't remember it wasn't bebelpales

1011
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
was it? oh no it was pebelpales or something

1012
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,000
it was absolutely hilarious

1013
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,000
um I remember

1014
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,000
being like

1015
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
she said what out loud when she said

1016
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,000
that I was absolutely he ho in

1017
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
um

1018
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
but then she couldn't keep the fan name

1019
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
and I'm like it is probably for the better

1020
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,000
people but you're absolutely hilarious

1021
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,000
please do not change

1022
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,000
um

1023
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,000
is this the cause? the worst

1024
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,000
the tuber is

1025
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,000
for their manager the better

1026
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,000
literally

1027
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,000
oh well I tell you

1028
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,000
I won't tell you

1029
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,000
um

1030
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,000
but yeah

1031
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,000
literally it was hilarious

1032
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,000
isn't that what everyone jokes about

1033
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
pipa they're like oh pipa is such a headache

1034
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
for her manager

1035
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,000
how is self management treating you

1036
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,000
delicious I don't have to do anything

1037
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,000
literally the girl

1038
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,000
as far as I'm aware the girls are happy

1039
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,000
they can pick what they want do what they want

1040
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,000
unfortunately

1041
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,000
because

1042
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,000
Azura and Emi

1043
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,000
are on a warning

1044
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,000
um

1045
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
by juicy youtube thanks to their

1046
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,000
hidden ASMR update guidelines

1047
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,000
um

1048
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,000
I am does say thank you for the tip

1049
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,000
and on this

1050
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,000
thank you for your tip

1051
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,000
um

1052
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,000
oh

1053
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,000
unfortunately I've not

1054
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,000
I've kind of discouraged them

1055
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,000
for doing ASMR until the warning is up

1056
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,000
because it's very dangerous

1057
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
if they get a strike um

1058
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,000
I'm like brav

1059
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
youtube please

1060
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,000
I'm back

1061
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,000
I got distracted oh don't worry I'm literally here

1062
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,000
for 12 hours don't worry

1063
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,000
we're doing an endurance today I have had

1064
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,000
so many short streams this week

1065
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,000
it felt so weird

1066
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,000
like I do have a lot

1067
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,000
of time to like finally start editing

1068
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,000
I have a heck of a lot of vtuber

1069
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
ASMR collabs coming through

1070
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,000
I wrote an ASMR collab

1071
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,000
for two the girls would be allure together

1072
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,000
um

1073
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000
and

1074
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,000
the girls

1075
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,000
one of them reacted

1076
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,000
and thought the plot was adorable

1077
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,000
it's just super basic short plot

1078
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,000
I never want to overwhelm the girls

1079
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,000
with anything that I assign them

1080
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,000
so please don't think it's like some super mega

1081
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,000
do do do do do

1082
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,000
eh

1083
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,000
I know that there is a collab with Mercy

1084
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,000
that's both audio and

1085
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,000
55

1086
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,000
um that's both audio

1087
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,000
and we get to play this game tomorrow

1088
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,000
um not tomorrow not tomorrow

1089
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,000
next week next week

1090
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,000
um I am going to play RuneScape

1091
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,000
before it because

1092
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,000
I am going to stream on

1093
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,000
Mercy's time zone like when she

1094
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,000
normally streams um

1095
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,000
so basically we're gonna play RuneScape

1096
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,000
for a solid

1097
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,000
chunk and then I'm gonna go offline and

1098
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,000
rest my voice for like an hour

1099
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,000
or two no probably

1100
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,000
two hours because I'll be in voice call

1101
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,000
with Mercy one hour before

1102
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,000
eh the collab if you didn't know

1103
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,000

1104
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,000
to show up one hour before

1105
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,000

failures as I had with

1109
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,000
flipping

1110
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,000

for keeping my head on my shoulders

1112
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,000
I was panicking when

1113
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
we could not do up

1114
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,000

1117
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,000
grind on me

1118
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,000
relax your mind

1119
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,000

1123
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,000
carambua

1124
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,000
when you start cooking

1125
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,000
members first

1126
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,000
I have like

1127
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,000
10,000 swordfish to go through

1128
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,000
I have no idea what even potential

1129
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,000
xp that might is

1130
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,000
that might is ok well

1131
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,000
one you're done what english was that

1132
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,000
eh is that a threat or a promise

1133
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,000
eh I was gonna

1134
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,000
do marshmallows

1135
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,000
actually I got such nice

1136
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,000
marshmallows you guys need to stop being so nice to me because

1137
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,000
if I get emotional

1138
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,000
and start reading them I start getting

1139
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,000
teary eyed and I'm like I can't handle these

1140
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,000
right now because it's gonna like make me cry

1141
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,000
like happy tears

1142
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,000
so you guys need to stop being so nice to me

1143
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,000
there's currently a reflin

1144
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,000
ehm

1145
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,000
who's keeping me updated about their addiction

1146
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,000
right now and they're like

1147
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,000
I don't even feel the need to go back to my addiction

1148
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,000
I'm like oh my god you're kicking your addiction

1149
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,000
I'm like how are you

1150
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,000
what how

1151
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,000
like that's amazing like I could get

1152
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,000
into the nitty-gritty of like how insane

1153
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,000
addiction is and look

1154
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,000
your brain once it creates

1155
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,000
a neural pathway it likes it wants to keep

1156
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,000
repeating that it's nice and easy it's why

1157
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,000
nostalgia is so powerful because you don't

1158
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,000
have to like learn the new lore of something

1159
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,000
it sounds silly but

1160
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,000
ehm

1161
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,000
like it's very easy

1162
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,000
to fall into addiction

1163
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,000
and especially

1164
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,000
your makeup your genetic

1165
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,000
makeup can make you predisposition

1166
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,000
for it as well it's quite it's quite fascinating

1167
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,000
because it's like it's kind of like

1168
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,000
gamba like I spoke previously

1169
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,000
I had a

1170
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,000
advertisement offer

1171
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,000
of four thousand US dollars

1172
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,000
to insert a 60 second

1173
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,000
gamba ad

1174
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,000
and I said no because

1175
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,000
it's gamba

1176
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,000
but it's very interesting

1177
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,000
how

1178
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,000
severely gamba seems to

1179
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,000
affect individuals

1180
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,000
now this is just an observation

1181
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,000
but whenever I've seen

1182
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,000
gamba ads that are like stop when the fund

1183
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,000
stops a ten thousand

1184
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,000
swordfish should get you to level 78

1185
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,000
let's go

1186
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,000
oh my god 78 by 9 to the stream

1187
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,000
ehm

1188
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,000
whenever you see a gamba ad that's like don't

1189
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,000
is like stop stop when the fund stops

1190
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,000
they always show a guy

1191
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,000
and I'm wondering

1192
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,000
ehm

1193
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,000
is the predisp... not the pre

1194
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,000
the socialization

1195
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,000
because obviously if we're being

1196
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,000
very stereotypical of society

1197
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,000
we live in a society

1198
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,000
guys are normally more interested in sports

1199
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,000
and is the

1200
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,000
environment around it that it's normal

1201
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,000
to gamble

1202
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,000
and kind of like put a cheeky

1203
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,000
10 or here on this

1204
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,000
bet a 20

1205
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,000
quid here on this bet type thing

1206
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,000
before it snowballs out of control

1207
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,000
it's quite

1208
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,000
fascinating I actually had someone

1209
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,000
in real life I knew

1210
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,000
that

1211
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,000
they weren't a family member but

1212
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,000
they were like an acquaintance and I learned

1213
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,000
of their story

1214
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,000
and basically

1215
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,000
the guy gambled away their mortgage

1216
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,000
and

1217
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,000
it's just

1218
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,000
it's such a shame what kind of grip

1219
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:22,000
it has

1220
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,000
on certain people because for me

1221
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,000
right now I

1222
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:28,000
I am

1223
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,000
I'm like confident that I don't have

1224
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,000
that kind of addiction

1225
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,000
I

1226
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,000
it doesn't appeal to me

1227
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,000
I would walk away

1228
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,000
like angry that I wasted

1229
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,000
my money type thing like my brain

1230
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,000
doesn't go oh

1231
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,000
if I gamble again I'll make back

1232
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:48,000
what I lost like no my brain's like

1233
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,000
I'll waste the time that was I'd rather play

1234
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,000
like a video game or something else like that

1235
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,000
you know

1236
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,000
I wish I could join you but not on RuneScape

1237
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:58,000
wait what's wrong with RuneScape

1238
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:00,000
it's old school

1239
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,000
look these are all Reeflings we're all just hanging

1240
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,000
out outside the we're all hanging

1241
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,000
out in Edgeville for no particular

1242
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,000
reason

1243
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,000
um

1244
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,000
yeah sorry I don't know if

1245
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,000
I need to turn down the

1246
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,000
that sound

1247
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:18,000
effect

1248
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:20,000
I'll turn down the sound effect just because

1249
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:22,000
it's very repetitive

1250
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:24,000
but hopefully you can still

1251
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,000
hear it but

1252
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,000
sorry

1253
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:30,000
we're in Edgeville together where you can do better

1254
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:32,000
90% of gamblers quit

1255
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:34,000
before they've been big now I have seen those

1256
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,000
memes I have to admit they're a wee bit funny

1257
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:38,000
but it is

1258
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:40,000
just a very curious

1259
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,000
predicament that people seem to get themselves into

1260
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,000
I mean that's kind of what

1261
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,000
kick the website kick.com

1262
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,000
if you heard about it

1263
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,000
the only

1264
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,000
reason they are able to be fueled

1265
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:56,000
so high is because of

1266
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:58,000
Gamble

1267
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,000
there's no other

1268
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,000
reason and it's perfectly

1269
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,000
fine to say that

1270
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,000
but it just kind of goes to show

1271
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,000
you how big the house always

1272
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:12,000
wins if they can offer this business

1273
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,000
model on the side

1274
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,000
I don't know if you guys remember

1275
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,000
when Twitch officially announced

1276
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,000
it's like banning Gamble

1277
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,000
it's just very curious

1278
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,000
because

1279
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,000
there's a lot of

1280
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:30,000
discussion you can get into and you can say

1281
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,000
well the person that's Gamble

1282
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:34,000
and it's their money

1283
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,000
it's their life

1284
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,000
it's their choice

1285
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:40,000
but if like

1286
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,000
I'm trying to think

1287
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,000
and do two things at once and it's not coming out in a sense

1288
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,000
so

1289
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:50,000
is it the

1290
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,000
hold on let me put my sense together

1291
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,000
when is it not a choice

1292
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:58,000
when is it not a choice is the question

1293
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,000
why is it it's addiction

1294
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,000
and not a choice when it comes to

1295
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:04,000
Gamble but it might be

1296
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,000
a choice when it comes to other bad actions

1297
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,000
you might do in your life

1298
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:10,000
why is Gamble marked out for one

1299
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:12,000
why is alcoholism marked out for one

1300
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,000
obviously when it comes to alcoholism

1301
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:16,000
your body does change the tolerance

1302
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,000
but you could argue the same for Gamble

1303
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,000
because your brain literally

1304
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,000
lights up like fireworks

1305
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,000
when you win

1306
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,000
and it's just very

1307
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,000
interesting because where's the line

1308
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:30,000
drawn from someone is consenting

1309
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,000
to do this activity and someone

1310
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,000
isn't able to consent to do this activity

1311
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:36,000
because it's causing harm

1312
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:38,000
you could argue sitting on runescape

1313
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:40,000
for 12 hours well that's causing harm

1314
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,000
oh well

1315
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,000
we'll need to take her offline

1316
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:46,000
because she's not well because she's doing this

1317
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:48,000
for 12 hours because that's bad

1318
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:50,000
for her health sitting for 12 hours

1319
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:52,000
type thing you know

1320
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:54,000
do you know what I'm trying to say out loud

1321
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:56,000
I struggle to say the words

1322
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,000
thank you for coming

1323
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,000
I'm a member tier

1324
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,000
destructive behaviours that have historically

1325
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:04,000
been deemed as vices that's where it is

1326
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:06,000
yeah like

1327
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,000
we're being called out literally all runescapers

1328
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,000
getting called out from across the line

1329
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:12,000
wow we're about to level up again

1330
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,000
oh my god just let me do

1331
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:16,000
one ramble and we're going to be

1332
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:18,000
99 overnight like just

1333
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:20,000
give me one subject to ramble about

1334
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,000
and we're done there is a logout

1335
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,000
timer after 6 hours I will

1336
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:26,000
most likely log me out when I go for the big job

1337
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:28,000
but I don't need one right now

1338
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,000
but yeah

1339
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:34,000
in college maxing on runescapers did it

1340
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:36,000
on homework real

1341
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:38,000
the lines do get but well that's

1342
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:40,000
it's the interesting thing it's like when

1343
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:42,000
where do laws come into place to protect

1344
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:44,000
gamble

1345
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:46,000
gamblers sorry

1346
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:48,000
because when you lose

1347
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:50,000
your money you're told tough

1348
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:52,000
tough bananas

1349
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:54,000
yay 56

1350
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:56,000
yatta

1351
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:58,000
when you lose all your money you're told

1352
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:00,000
tough bananas

1353
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,000
when you lose your money to scam

1354
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:04,000
the bank says see tough bananas

1355
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:06,000
but yeah there's laws in place

1356
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:08,000
to protect you in quotation marks

1357
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:10,000
and to get the

1358
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:12,000
scammers put in jail to get

1359
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:14,000
well you can't really put

1360
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:16,000
casinos in jail so that doesn't work

1361
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:18,000
that's a terrible

1362
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:20,000
comparison

1363
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:26,000
hmm

1364
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:28,000
well I've kind of shot myself in that

1365
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:30,000
line of thought I've completely undone

1366
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:32,000
that line of thought there I do apologize

1367
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:34,000
um

1368
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:36,000
there's really

1369
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:38,000
no good answer no there isn't

1370
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:40,000
that's the thing

1371
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:42,000
that's the thing that's the thing I want to

1372
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:44,000
highlight there is

1373
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:46,000
no answer and yet

1374
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:48,000
we still have some laws such as

1375
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:50,000
you know obviously twitch isn't

1376
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:52,000
law but twitch is a reflection

1377
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:54,000
of the community views

1378
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:56,000
or the views of the masses

1379
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:58,000
now do you remember

1380
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:00,000
when a

1381
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:02,000
pokemon was like yeah gamma bad

1382
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:04,000
and then all of a sudden twitter blew up

1383
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,000
and then twitter was like

1384
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:08,000
gamma bad and then twitch was like

1385
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:10,000
okay now we'll remove

1386
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:12,000
gamma like

1387
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:14,000
that is a perfect

1388
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:16,000
example of

1389
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:18,000
the most basic movement

1390
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:20,000
now don't get me wrong movement isn't world changing

1391
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:22,000
but it is the basic example

1392
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:24,000
of someone who definitely

1393
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:26,000
is on a larger platform

1394
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:28,000
going hey this thing

1395
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:30,000
bad and then everyone going

1396
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:32,000
wait a minute yes

1397
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:34,000
this thing is bad

1398
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:36,000
and then boom

1399
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:38,000
twitch

1400
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:40,000
got rid of the category

1401
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:42,000
and outlawed it and said no bad

1402
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:44,000
now that is

1403
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:46,000
and just

1404
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:48,000
a bloody perfect example

1405
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:50,000
of how

1406
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:52,000
the community

1407
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:54,000
the community

1408
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:56,000
in specific areas and pockets

1409
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:58,000
do have a voice

1410
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:00,000
and do have a say

1411
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:02,000
as much as you might not think on an individual level

1412
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:04,000
you don't have a voice

1413
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:06,000
it might be true but have you ever seen

1414
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:08,000
planet of the apes

1415
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:10,000
monkey on own

1416
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:12,000
weak

1417
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:14,000
monkey together strong

1418
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:16,000
it is true

1419
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:18,000
you can't even deny it there's so many examples

1420
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:20,000
of this

1421
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:22,000
like think of revolutions

1422
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:24,000
such as the french revolution

1423
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:26,000
one individual would get their head

1424
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:28,000
guillotined ok

1425
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:30,000
I'm not being funny I'm being so

1426
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:32,000
true this is my rabbit hole

1427
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:34,000
but like literally the french

1428
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:36,000
revolution one person stands up

1429
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:38,000
and gets their head chopped off right

1430
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:40,000
no revolution no movement

1431
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:42,000
community is not you know

1432
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:44,000
community is not going to rise up

1433
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:46,000
but hold on a minute the people are revolting

1434
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:48,000
the people

1435
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:50,000
are revolting the masses are outraged

1436
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,000
how can society continue

1437
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:54,000
if everyone bands together

1438
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:56,000
and

1439
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:58,000
historically every 400 years

1440
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:00,000
society

1441
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:02,000
shifts and what do I mean by

1442
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:04,000
society shifts something new

1443
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:06,000
comes up for society to be

1444
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:08,000
a part of ok

1445
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:10,000
so before capitalism

1446
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:12,000
which is when global

1447
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:14,000
economics became a thing ok

1448
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:16,000
like kinda the industrial revolution

1449
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:18,000
global economics there was

1450
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:20,000
region locked capitalism

1451
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:22,000
ok and it's called feudalism

1452
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:24,000
or something like that it's like

1453
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:26,000
it's not feudalism it's like feudalism

1454
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:28,000
ok

1455
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:30,000
which was when

1456
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:32,000
lords owned

1457
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:34,000
the plots of land and permitted

1458
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:36,000
peasants to generate food

1459
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:38,000
on those lands ok

1460
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:40,000
that was region locked capitalism

1461
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:42,000
before we know capitalism today ok

1462
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:44,000
but that got outdated when

1463
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:46,000
the revolution came in

1464
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:48,000
because you know

1465
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:50,000
people learn fast to

1466
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:52,000
grow certain crops and if you breed

1467
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:54,000
crops I can't remember who did the crop breeding

1468
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:56,000
what's his name

1469
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:58,000
ah sugar I

1470
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:00,000
forgotten feudalism

1471
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:02,000
is with lords yes yes

1472
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:04,000
the chickens are revolting

1473
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:06,000
finally we agree on something

1474
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:08,000
bro it's not 400 years it's like a decade

1475
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:10,000
stuff changes all the time

1476
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:12,000
but like another massive example

1477
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:14,000
shift in society and you're not gonna like

1478
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:16,000
some of yous are not gonna like this but

1479
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:18,000
you're in for a rambling stream

1480
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:20,000
you know you've got me for 12 hours as if

1481
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:22,000
I'm not gonna get on my high horse and teach you history ok

1482
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:24,000
if you

1483
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:26,000
did not know

1484
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:28,000
in Christianity

1485
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:30,000
there's the old testament

1486
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:32,000
and there's the new testament

1487
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:34,000
the new testament

1488
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:36,000
is was created

1489
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:38,000
I believe in

1490
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:40,000
roughly the 15th century

1491
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:42,000
the church got together and went

1492
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:44,000
look the old testament

1493
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:46,000
isn't doing it for the masses

1494
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:48,000
people are starting to question that

1495
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:50,000
because people are becoming aware

1496
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:52,000
that you know

1497
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:54,000
some things aren't working out in the

1498
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:56,000
story

1499
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:58,000
and basically the new testament

1500
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:00,000
is just

1501
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:02,000
friggin made up

1502
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:04,000
1500

1503
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:06,000
years later after

1504
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:08,000
Jebus the source supposedly

1505
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:10,000
passed away

1506
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:12,000
you're so right Strony let's eat the rich

1507
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:14,000
yes! fun blue thank you for the two

1508
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:18,000
like some people can't conceptualize

1509
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:20,000
the difference between a million and a billion

1510
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:22,000
dollars

1511
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:24,000
now take that million and add one

1512
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:26,000
and then add one and then add one

1513
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:28,000
and then add one and keep going and keep going

1514
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:30,000
and keep going and keep going

1515
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:32,000
anyway

1516
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:34,000
casually red fill in the masses

1517
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:36,000
I'm not kidding I will keep mentioning

1518
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:38,000
in the game

1519
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:40,000
needy streamer overload I cannot even believe

1520
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:42,000
they put that in the game that kind of thing

1521
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:44,000
okay

1522
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:46,000
but anyway

1523
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:48,000
anyway that's just me

1524
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:50,000
I don't know what you guys are thinking

1525
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:52,000
but that's just me

1526
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:54,000
but I could really get on my high horse

1527
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:56,000
I should actually I want to do an education stream

1528
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:58,000
about feudalism because

1529
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:00,000
and like kind of

1530
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:02,000
how history and how society used to work

1531
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:04,000
because bargaining used to be how it was

1532
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:06,000
done! bargaining used to be like

1533
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:08,000
hey I have

1534
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:10,000
two weeks would you

1535
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:12,000
trade me one potato for two weeks

1536
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:14,000
that's how it used to be done

1537
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:16,000
that's how there was value in things

1538
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:18,000
that's how humans did it

1539
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:20,000
and and freaking

1540
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:22,000
there are

1541
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:24,000
there are some examples today

1542
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:26,000
of it kind of thriving

1543
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:28,000
and

1544
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:30,000
so runescape is historically

1545
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:32,000
accurate yes! you guys

1546
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:34,000
trading me right now

1547
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:36,000
you are calling upon your ancestors

1548
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:38,000
to give me the resources that you don't

1549
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:40,000
need in the moment you are looking

1550
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:42,000
after me and in return

1551
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:44,000
I will scratch your back later

1552
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:46,000
it's literally why I'm such a big believer

1553
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:48,000
and you scratch my back I scratch yours

1554
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:50,000
because that's how it used to be

1555
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:52,000
return to monkey

1556
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:54,000
replays return to monkey

1557
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:56,000
we were so nice

1558
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:58,000
we had some communities

1559
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:00,000
we had said it's a belonging

1560
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,000
it's so nice

1561
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:04,000
the old test schools

1562
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:06,000
oh right okay you're done

1563
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:08,000
out of curiosity

1564
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:10,000
I've not touched old school runescape

1565
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:12,000
what's with the cooking not cooking window

1566
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:14,000
on the top left so I am using

1567
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:16,000
a plugin called runelight

1568
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:18,000
you can see it up here this plugin

1569
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:20,000
can track your things

1570
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:22,000
there are good bad examples of this

1571
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:24,000
one stick is weak

1572
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:26,000
many together are strong

1573
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:28,000
like the 1940s

1574
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:30,000
monkey

1575
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:32,000

English and technically

1678
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:20,000
Scots is a recognized language

1679
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:22,000
but I am

1680
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:24,000
a Scottish

1681
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:30,000
oh that was another funny image

1682
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:32,000
aww but I couldn't say that

1683
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:34,000
when I was playing Assassin's Creed

1684
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:36,000
Brotherhood someone did a

1685
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:38,000
text post and it was like

1686
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:40,000
be me pic related 1500

1687
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:42,000
some

1688
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:44,000
mumbling assassin comes my way

1689
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:46,000
it keeps me in my balls, keeps rambling

1690
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:48,000
walks away or something

1691
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:50,000
but I couldn't save it

1692
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:52,000
I want to save it because it's a funny meme

1693
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:54,000
I like saving the memes that you guys make

1694
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:56,000
because it makes me so happy

1695
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:58,000
why do I keep clicking that one

1696
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:00,000
oh my cat's outside

1697
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:02,000
Gimli you're not coming in the day

1698
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:04,000
that was ridiculous yesterday

1699
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:06,000
I shouldn't have let her in

1700
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:08,000
because now she thinks she can come in

1701
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:10,000
all the time and I'm like Gimli no

1702
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:12,000
we can't come in so she's just going to have to

1703
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:14,000
save my door until she gets the message

1704
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:16,000
I'm sorry Gimli

1705
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:18,000
I'm sorry

1706
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:20,000
the last time she played Stardew

1707
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:22,000
she went karaoke for 5 hours

1708
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:24,000
she has endurance over her mummy

1709
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:26,000
literally she was on for like 8 hours

1710
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:28,000
the last time I checked I don't know when she went off

1711
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:30,000
um

1712
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:32,000
do you have plans to get membership

1713
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:34,000
oh I already have membership

1714
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:36,000
I'm just playing on free to play so I can hang

1715
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:38,000
up all the reflins like check us out

1716
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:40,000
look all these reflins

1717
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:42,000
we're all just hanging

1718
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:44,000
we're all cooking

1719
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:46,000
wait you guys aren't cooking

1720
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:50,000
oh you're putting more logs on the fire

1721
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:54,000
but I'm cooking

1722
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:56,000
oh thank you

1723
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:58,000
thank you fireman

1724
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:00,000
cabbage patch head is doing something

1725
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:02,000
I don't know

1726
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:04,000
oh we've got just an echo

1727
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:08,000
we're linking the fire

1728
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:10,000
oh I understand

1729
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:12,000
but yeah all the reflins

1730
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:14,000
I didn't want to alienate anyone

1731
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:16,000
if they can't do members at the moment

1732
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:18,000
and we're not cooking

1733
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:20,000
wait a minute

1734
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:22,000
wait a minute

1735
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:24,000
we're not cooking

1736
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:28,000
any membership items yet

1737
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:30,000
so we don't need to go in a membership world

1738
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:32,000
a lot of reflings gifted me

1739
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:34,000
a ton of fish

1740
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:36,000
so I'm just powering through that now

1741
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:38,000
and

1742
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:40,000
another reflin

1743
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:42,000
gave me 10,000 friggin sword fish

1744
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:44,000
I don't know how long it's going to take to get through that

1745
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:46,000
I don't know if that might actually take us

1746
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:48,000
to the end of the

1747
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:50,000
stream

1748
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:52,000
10,000 fish

1749
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:54,000
since a lot

1750
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:56,000
you betrayed Gimli I know

1751
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:58,000
you don't know French

1752
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:00,000
I've been lied to

1753
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:02,000
oh sorry Miser

1754
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:04,000
I can't

1755
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:06,000
I can't do it

1756
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:08,000
I can humorously do

1757
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:10,000
what are you doing today

1758
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:12,000
what are you doing

1759
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:14,000
what are you doing

1760
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:16,000
I can do French

1761
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:18,000
Scottish

1762
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:20,000
just to mess with you

1763
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:22,000
but the actual French

1764
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:24,000
speaking

1765
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:26,000
like

1766
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:30,000
I'm trying to think of a sense

1767
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:32,000
to say

1768
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:34,000
Montichons

1769
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:36,000
Machichons

1770
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:38,000
I think is French for my

1771
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:40,000
Yiddies

1772
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:42,000
oh my brain

1773
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:44,000
my brain can't parley the French right now

1774
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:46,000
it's too hard

1775
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:48,000
my roommate that showed me

1776
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:50,000
your content just DM'd me that

1777
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:52,000
because of that super chat

1778
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:54,000
they're like I know

1779
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:56,000
what you are

1780
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:58,000
oh Gimli

1781
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:00,000
I can't have you in the room

1782
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:02,000
she's just gonna

1783
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:04,000
go back to sleep

1784
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:06,000
I was playing with my

1785
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:08,000
cats before a live stream

1786
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:10,000
to tire them out

1787
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:12,000
but I couldn't play with her too long

1788
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:14,000
so she's currently going nuts right now

1789
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:16,000
but she'll go down for a sleep because she wasn't sleeping

1790
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:18,000
when I was sleeping so she'll

1791
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:20,000
don't worry, don't worry about my pooders

1792
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:22,000
and whenever I go make a tea in that

1793
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:24,000
I'll go give her some attention

1794
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:26,000
baby boy is really independent

1795
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:28,000
though he's like not

1796
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:30,000
caring I don't know if it's because he's half

1797
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:32,000
a munchkin that he's more

1798
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:34,000
tired than the usual cat

1799
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:36,000
you can get depending on the breed of your cat

1800
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:38,000
it can be really tired in general

1801
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:40,000
and need like more sleep

1802
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:42,000
I'm pretty sure there's a type

1803
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:44,000
of dog that's known for sleeping

1804
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:46,000
oh wait it's Greyhounds

1805
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:48,000
Greyhounds are like the laziest

1806
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:50,000
dog ever but they can do like

1807
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:52,000
one burst sprint type thing

1808
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:56,000
21 million

1809
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:58,000
literally I got sugar daddy

1810
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:00,000
out the wazoo because of reeflings

1811
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:02,000
they were throwing them coins

1812
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:04,000
to me I was like I'm not gonna say

1813
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:06,000
no this is gonna fund the

1814
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:08,000
I don't know if we're doing wine

1815
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:10,000
I don't know if wine is the fastest

1816
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:12,000
level up once I've

1817
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:14,000
like cooked everything

1818
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:16,000
if I push it I can finish

1819
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:18,000
my first save file in November

1820
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:20,000
oh I haven't even finished a save file

1821
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:22,000
I was considering doing some eating runs

1822
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:24,000
just to show you guys what

1823
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:26,000
the binding of Isaac

1824
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:28,000
is all about

1825
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:30,000
who needs a bot farm

1826
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:32,000
when you have a cult giving you everything

1827
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:34,000
you need literally though

1828
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:38,000
when I had a Saint Bernard

1829
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:40,000
it felt like it slept for 20 hours a day

1830
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:42,000
yeah like depending on the breed

1831
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:44,000
but she's just moody

1832
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:46,000
I fed her and I played with her

1833
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:48,000
mouse but

1834
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:50,000
the problem is because I let her

1835
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:52,000
in yesterday

1836
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:54,000
she now thinks she can come in whenever she wants

1837
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:58,000
you're a bit of a diva

1838
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:00,000
Gimli you're a bit of a diva

1839
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:02,000
I have to admit

1840
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:04,000
but I love her

1841
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:06,000
I love her

1842
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:08,000
you're always cooking

1843
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:10,000
oh I ain't just cooking a runescape

1844
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:14,000
I can't

1845
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:16,000
tomorrow's crash bandicoot

1846
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:20,000
yes

1847
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:22,000
I think

1848
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:24,000
July streams

1849
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:26,000
I'm gonna focus on Xbox games

1850
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:28,000
to get my gamer score up

1851
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:30,000
I've done

1852
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:32,000
decent progress on my goal

1853
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:34,000
of collabing with 100 vtubers

1854
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:36,000
with a 3d old thing

1855
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:38,000
like 3 ASMR collabs

1856
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:40,000
I have absolutely no issue

1857
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:42,000
with actually collabing on stream

1858
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:44,000
yeah good luck with that

1859
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:46,000
I'm too shy

1860
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:48,000
I've made great progress

1861
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:50,000
I think I'm just shy of

1862
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:52,000
6 ASMR collabs

1863
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:58,000
and then I need to reach out

1864
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:00,000
and do

1865
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:06,000
I want to make all of my goals

1866
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:08,000
happen before the one year mark

1867
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:10,000
which means I have to work hard now

1868
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:12,000
and

1869
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:14,000
so

1870
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:16,000
and

1871
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:18,000
we've got membership coming up as well

1872
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:20,000
because we've got a lot of lost time

1873
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:22,000
to make up for but I hope

1874
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:24,000
you can see with my efforts

1875
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:26,000
and all my hard work there

1876
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:28,000
I'm making up for lost time

1877
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:30,000
it's going good

1878
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:32,000
I want content out the wazoo

1879
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:34,000
I want it to be

1880
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:36,000
good funny times

1881
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:38,000
literally uploaded that meme ASMR

1882
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:40,000
please let me hold it

1883
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:42,000
any plans for halo?

1884
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:44,000
yes I would love if I could actually

1885
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:46,000
do

1886
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:48,000
a vtuber collab on halo

1887
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:50,000
but I don't know

1888
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:52,000
anyone who's played halo

1889
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:54,000
I will ask the vlo girls

1890
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:56,000
first before I ask around

1891
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:58,000
and see if anyone's played halo

1892
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:02,000
not that you need to be

1893
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:04,000
good at halo

1894
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:06,000
to play it like you need to know about it

1895
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:08,000
but I'd rather

1896
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:10,000
I think if you're playing a nostalgic game

1897
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:12,000
I'd rather like two people who are

1898
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:14,000
familiar with it play

1899
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:16,000
I know that sounds really rude I hope it doesn't come across as rude

1900
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:18,000
but I mean

1901
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:20,000
I'm sure there's another halo vtuber

1902
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:22,000
that's freaking good

1903
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:24,000
random question are you playing any drg streams?

1904
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:26,000
what?

1905
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:28,000
drg?

1906
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:30,000
what's drg?

1907
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:32,000
sorry you're gonna have to spell it out for me my brain is very slow

1908
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:34,000
I

1909
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:36,000
you'll like to

1910
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:38,000
check

1911
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:40,000
who?

1912
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:42,000
yes I think I can play with you guys

1913
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:46,000
just as a word

1914
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:48,000
or a word of warning

1915
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:50,000
it's not a word of warning

1916
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:52,000
ac snow paws is live with

1917
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:54,000
space channel 5

1918
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:56,000
part 2

1919
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:58,000
and imibizu is live

1920
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:00,000
with the coffin of andy and leily

1921
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:02,000
and she's doing an endurance stream

1922
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:04,000
I'm so proud

1923
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:06,000
as my cat is currently kicking down the door

1924
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:08,000
oh my god

1925
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:10,000
she's getting that really frustrated

1926
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:12,000
um

1927
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:14,000
but yes

1928
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:16,000
I think

1929
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:18,000
I can play deep rock galactica

1930
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:20,000
with you guys and it's not an issue

1931
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:22,000
at all

1932
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:24,000
she's trying to do the good ending

1933
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:26,000
sorry there's only one ending and andy and leily

1934
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:28,000
and I will not be taking any comments

1935
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:30,000
I don't even

1936
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:32,000
I'm

1937
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:34,000
there's only one true ending

1938
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:36,000
and I won't have it

1939
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:38,000
any other way

1940
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:40,000
me trying to hold in her

1941
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:42,000
oh god the peeler

1942
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:44,000
we literally can't outrun them

1943
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:46,000
that gartic phone stream was so fun though

1944
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:48,000
the girls are so funny

1945
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:50,000
um

1946
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:52,000
but yeah

1947
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:54,000
the

1948
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:56,000
already leveled up again

1949
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:58,000
literally I am rambling through these levels

1950
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:00,000
like nothing on earth

1951
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:02,000
like I wake up on the other side of the ramble

1952
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:04,000
and we're literally 58

1953
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:06,000
that's fantastic

1954
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:08,000
oh my goodness

1955
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:10,000
all these lobbies

1956
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:12,000
I'm burning them a wee bit but it's fine okay

1957
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:14,000
you and emmy agree hard on that

1958
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:16,000
ending yeah

1959
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:18,000
literally I'm sorry but why on earth would you make

1960
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:20,000
why would you

1961
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:22,000
why would you play the game and be like

1962
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:24,000
uh I'm not gonna do that ending

1963
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:26,000
no the whole point is to like

1964
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:28,000
be fine with human curiosity

1965
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:30,000
like as long as you don't produce any offspring

1966
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:32,000
no one gives a rat

1967
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:34,000
anyone geyser

1968
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:36,000
honestly

1969
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:40,000
hmm

1970
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:42,000
halo would be a fun way to do community games

1971
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:44,000
uh like the halo molly player

1972
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:46,000
I never actually played much of it

1973
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:48,000
I heard

1974
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:50,000
the bat

1975
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:52,000
was it a halo battle pass came out

1976
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:54,000
and it was just an absolute shambles

1977
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:56,000
like it was just a terrible multiplayer

1978
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:58,000
launch

1979
01:11:58,000 --> 01:12:00,000
and then they did battle pass

1980
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:02,000
and then it just became

1981
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:04,000
like this terrible

1982
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:06,000
thing I don't know

1983
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:08,000
what ending the one

1984
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:10,000
true ending

1985
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:12,000
oh actually I was

1986
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:14,000
lurking quite a lot someone was like

1987
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:16,000
wait I don't get it are we emmy's brother

1988
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:18,000
the reason why you can see

1989
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:20,000
emmy at all times when she

1990
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:22,000
streams is because you're her dead brother

1991
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:24,000
watching over her

1992
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:26,000
I will spell it out for you

1993
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:28,000
you are her

1994
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:30,000
dead brother watching over her

1995
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:32,000
which is why you can see her stream

1996
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:34,000
which is why you can see her thoughts on twitter

1997
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:36,000
okay

1998
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:38,000
I'll spell it out for you

1999
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:42,000
the pin pals I don't get it

2000
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:44,000
hold on hydration guys

2001
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:46,000

hmm

2003
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:50,000
very important

2004
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:52,000
hmm

2005
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:54,000
oh actually

2006
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:56,000

01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:02,000
is after and it's like a super small

2010
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:04,000
game

2011
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:06,000
if it's a small game don't worry

2012
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:08,000
I'm going to you whenever I do

2013

01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:18,000

01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:20,000

2049
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:22,000
support the girls via oobu market

2050
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:24,000

2051
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:26,000
of the income generated

2052
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:28,000
dealer do not take a cut

2053
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:30,000
and the girls can attest to that

2054
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:32,000
we don't have anything to do with it

2055
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:34,000
and it completely

2056
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:36,000
and wholeheartedly supports them

2057
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:38,000
if you wanted to

2058
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:40,000
collect all the key chains of the girls

2059
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:42,000
that could be something very sweet and cute

2060
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:44,000
I'm gonna make an ASMR of me tapping it

2061
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:46,000

2063
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:50,000

I'm so

2068
01:14:58,000 --> 01:15:00,000
glad that the girls can see their hard

2069
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:02,000
effort like pay off right away

2070
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:04,000
um they've been nothing

2071
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:06,000
but fantastic they really have

2072
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:08,000
um is the

2073
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:10,000
merch limited no

2074
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:12,000
it's gonna stay up um

2075
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:14,000
until

2076
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:16,000
until we expire oobu

2077
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:18,000
market has been absolutely fantastic

2078
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:20,000
to work with um

2079
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:22,000
they are super good

2080
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:24,000
I am aware that

2081
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:26,000
they got a bit of flat because of some production issues

2082
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:28,000
but they actually

2083
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:30,000
moved um

2084
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:32,000
they moved locations

2085
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:34,000
quite a few times because their business

2086
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:36,000
expanded so fast that they basically

2087
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:38,000
had growing pains but I

2088
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:40,000
have never personally had an issue with them

2089
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:42,000
now I know that's kind of being like

2090
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:44,000
well you never had an issue with others that's

2091
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:46,000
just dismissing the others relax

2092
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:48,000
I understand how it works but

2093
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:50,000
um to work with oobu market

2094
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:52,000
they've been they were so understanding from

2095
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:54,000
the get go because I messaged them

2096
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:56,000
and I'm like hey violers

2097
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:58,000
the thing I'd love it if the girls can

2098
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:00,000
keep a hundred percent of the earnings

2099
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:02,000
uh we as the company

2100
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:04,000
don't want to take a cut and they're like yeah

2101
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:06,000
we can set that up no problem and I was

2102
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:08,000
like here here's all the references to the artwork

2103
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:10,000
yeah we can do that no problem

2104
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:12,000
um and just they've handled

2105
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:14,000
everything and it has been

2106
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:16,000
really nice to not have

2107
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:18,000
to deal with anything it makes things

2108
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:20,000
nice and juicy and easy

2109
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:22,000
um

2110
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:24,000
uh one of the thing

2111
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:26,000
few things about violers the lack of

2112
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:28,000
corporation greed yeah I just

2113
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:30,000
I I mean

2114
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:32,000
scrawny scrawny can your

2115
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:34,000
patterns go in reverse

2116
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:36,000
no they can't they can

2117
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:38,000
they only go in reverse if I

2118
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:40,000
do that it'll like

2119
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:42,000
should yeah see how it goes in reverse

2120
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:44,000
it's because it has to reset

2121
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:46,000
to the top of my head in order

2122
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:48,000
to do that reverse thing

2123
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:50,000
we can test that again

2124
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:52,000
yeah see how it reverses to the top of my head

2125
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:54,000
that's to make sure it works thank you for the

2126
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:56,000

2127
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:58,000

2128
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:00,000

2129
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:02,000
via um

2130
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:04,000
money uh

2131
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:06,000
it's not necessary

2132
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:08,000
it's really not necessary you don't have to

2133
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:10,000
ask questions via money you're more than welcome

2134
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:12,000

2136
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:16,000
um

2137
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:18,000
but yes um I am

2138
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:20,000
a very strong believer

2139
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:22,000
in um the girls

2140
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:24,000
earned the money they get to keep the lines

2141
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:26,000
share um

2142
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:28,000
because I don't

2143
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:30,000
I don't think it's very nice

2144
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:32,000
if the girls were only

2145
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:34,000
earning like the standard 50-50

2146
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:36,000
rate like what's your motivation

2147
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:38,000
to work if every time you make

2148
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:40,000
100 bucks uh management

2149
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:42,000
take 50 for doing a fall

2150
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:44,000
other than like handing you

2151
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:46,000
the model because at this point in time

2152
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:48,000
it's kind of like

2153
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:50,000
again egan

2154
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:52,000

2155
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:54,000

01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:02,000
do you have a rave party with your hair

with my hair other than the toggle

2162
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:08,000
I just like hearing my name spoken

2163
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:10,000
with a Scottish accent you should teach others

2164
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:12,000
how to speak like that I think it could be a thing

2165
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:14,000
well she be starting to

2166
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:16,000
develop a not a pretty decent

2167
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:18,000
Scottish accent

2168
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:20,000
um I don't know how much

2169
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:22,000
she used to watch me wink wink

2170
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:24,000
um but

2171
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:26,000
she certainly gives the impression she's listened

2172
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:28,000
to me for a decent amount

2173
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:30,000
but when we were playing garlic phone

2174
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:32,000

2175
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:34,000
Joby hits your prostate on the way out

01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:36,000
um

2177
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:38,000
and everyone was like what's a Joby

2178
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:40,000
I'm like oh my god I really need to put a

2179
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:42,000

2233
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:46,000
Scottish cannot do

2234
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:48,000
yeah it gets caught

2235
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:50,000
my tongue gets caught on the roof of my mouth

2236
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:52,000
to try and enunciate burglar

2237
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:54,000
burglar burglar

2238
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:56,000
the box at the top left

2239
01:20:56,000 --> 01:20:58,000
tells you how fast

2240
01:20:58,000 --> 01:21:00,000
a thousand a thousand

2241
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:02,000
per hour so we will

2242
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:04,000
finish the swordfish I think

2243
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:06,000
we might be able to finish the swordfish

2244
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:08,000
if I don't get distracted and don't need

2245
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:10,000
like to go make too many teas

2246
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:14,000
I think at the three hour mark we'll take

2247
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:16,000
a toilet break

2248
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:18,000
and I'll get some food because I don't have any food

2249
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:20,000
in the morning like I just

2250
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:22,000
I wake up and I come on stream and I'm like

2251
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:24,000
alright what's going on that's what we're doing

2252
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:26,000
um

2253
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:28,000
with a steady pace

2254
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:30,000
you can do one an hour

2255
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:32,000
one K an hour

2256
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:34,000
that's that's pretty good

2257
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:36,000
that's really good

2258
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:38,000
right let's whittle this down

2259
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:40,000
to nothing then by the end of the stream

2260
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:42,000
we'll finish the stack of swordfish

2261
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:44,000
and see what leaves is that

2262
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:46,000

2271
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:08,000

I didn't hear brian talk

2281
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:30,000
I wonder if brian doesn't talk during super chats

2282
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:32,000

2283
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:34,000

2288
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:44,000

2289
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:46,000
wondering who the heck brian is

01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:54,000

folk hone in on but

2309
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:26,000

01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:28,000
special events like weddings are

2311
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:30,000
probably the biggest kill thing

2312
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:32,000

2313
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:34,000

2329
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:10,000
baby boy and baby girl get attention

2330
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:16,000

2339
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:38,000

2340
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:40,000

2341
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:42,000

2342
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:44,000
your tatty bojangles

2343
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:46,000

2344
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:48,000
I don't know how elastic

2345
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:50,000
yeah okay gimme lays me

2346
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:52,000
on out my door I can hear her go nuts

2347
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:54,000
she might start hammering on the door

2348
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:56,000
because she opens him by

2349
01:24:56,000 --> 01:24:58,000
going up on her back legs and like pushing

2350
01:24:58,000 --> 01:25:00,000
with her front paws so if you start hearing

2351
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:02,000
like that's her

2352
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:04,000
currently like opening the

2353
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:06,000
well attempting to open the door

2354
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:08,000
but I think

2355
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:10,000
you need to listen to this song

2356
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:12,000
donal where are your truzers

2357
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:14,000
it's a joke song about kilt I'd play it

2358
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:16,000
but I'd probably get copyright

2359
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:18,000
ridiculous oh my

2360
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:20,000
burn rate is 9%

2361
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:22,000
well hopefully that can get lowered

2362
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:24,000
because missing out on 10%

2363
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:26,000
xp on full inventories

2364
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:28,000
is rough

2365
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:30,000
is rough

2366
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:32,000
but we're getting there

2367
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:34,000
so how do I use it on the thing

2368
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:36,000
ta da

2369
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:38,000
let the boys be free

2370
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:40,000
as nature intended

2371
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:42,000
true yes

2372
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:44,000
I love wearing a kill always makes me feel confident

2373
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:46,000
I remember that one scene from the carry on

2374
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:48,000
films where the scott shows their

2375
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:50,000
to scare

2376
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:52,000
to scare people

2377
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:54,000
I'm sure it probably

2378
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:56,000
like get it up here

2379
01:25:56,000 --> 01:25:58,000

2381
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:08,000
to climb a level

2382
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:10,000
we're starting to get there

2383
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:12,000

2384
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:14,000
a wee minute

2385
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:16,000

01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:36,000
$200 to stream

2419
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:38,000
but I drink

2420
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:40,000
like bottles of water every hour

2421
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:42,000
but I don't go to the toilet

2422
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:44,000
like it was their thing

2423
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:46,000

I did not

2430
01:27:58,000 --> 01:28:00,000
carry out with such a request

2431
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:02,000
however it was rather

2432
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:04,000
interesting learning about that because that was the first time I had ever been exposed to it

2433
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:10,000

Slayer sorry

2463
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:10,000
slaver is what's coming out my move

2464
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:12,000
because I can't stop

2465
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:14,000

01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:16,000
I'm like super dehydrated

2467
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:18,000
but there's a tactic

2468
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:20,000
to me being dehydrated

2469
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:22,000
it means I don't have to pee as much

2470
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:24,000
and then I can be here and max out

2471
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:26,000
the swordfish run

2472
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:28,000
yeah

2473
01:29:28,000 --> 01:29:30,000
cuddles you're too subby you're not a good back

2474
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:32,000
corrector oh no they they get their way

2475
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:34,000
I'm sorry they all get their way I

2476
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:36,000
couldn't as long as they're happy

2477
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:38,000
I'm happy I get

2478
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:40,000
I genuinely get a dorphins

2479
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:42,000
knowing that they're happy or they have

2480
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:44,000
what they need and that's all

2481
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:46,000

01:29:54,000 --> 01:29:56,000
but I want to see her little toes because

2487
01:29:56,000 --> 01:29:58,000

about me but it's

2541
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:46,000
because

01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:48,000
I'm biased

2543
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:50,000
towards Emmys design the most because

01:31:52,000 --> 01:31:54,000

2553
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:10,000
the

2554
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:12,000

01:33:46,000 --> 01:33:48,000
we are currently cooking through that

2603
01:33:48,000 --> 01:33:50,000
and I am ranting and

2604
01:33:50,000 --> 01:33:52,000
raving my head off

2605
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:54,000
just about anything

2606
01:33:54,000 --> 01:33:56,000
and everything

2607
01:33:56,000 --> 01:33:58,000
but yes I was currently

2608
01:33:58,000 --> 01:34:00,000
gushing about the girls doing hand cam

2609
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:02,000
streams now that she

2610
01:34:02,000 --> 01:34:04,000
is monetized I actually don't know when

2611
01:34:04,000 --> 01:34:06,000
she's doing her monetization stream

2612
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:08,000
hold on let me just

2613
01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:10,000
let me just ask her

2614
01:34:10,000 --> 01:34:12,000
when are you

2615
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:14,000
doing monetization stream

2616
01:34:14,000 --> 01:34:16,000
cause I might need to put her monetization live

2617
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:18,000
um

2618
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:20,000
oops cause I've not put her monetization live

2619
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:22,000
um

2620
01:34:22,000 --> 01:34:24,000
and before you're like wait you control monetization

2621
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:26,000
no in order for the girls

2622
01:34:26,000 --> 01:34:28,000
to be less stressed I do

2623
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:30,000
the kind of boring stuff

2624
01:34:30,000 --> 01:34:32,000
which is opening up memberships and setting

2625
01:34:32,000 --> 01:34:34,000
the price and adding her emotes

2626
01:34:34,000 --> 01:34:36,000
to her badges for example

2627
01:34:36,000 --> 01:34:38,000
um hey fart head

2628
01:34:38,000 --> 01:34:40,000
hey shit

2629
01:34:40,000 --> 01:34:42,000
sorry um

2630
01:34:42,000 --> 01:34:44,000
yes so if she

2631
01:34:44,000 --> 01:34:46,000
be plans on doing it

2632
01:34:46,000 --> 01:34:48,000
day I will have to quickly run away

2633
01:34:48,000 --> 01:34:50,000
for 5 minutes and quickly set that up

2634
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:52,000
because I don't have access to her account

2635
01:34:52,000 --> 01:34:54,000
on the cc

2636
01:34:54,000 --> 01:34:56,000
your cash is 20 times the cost of that

2637
01:34:56,000 --> 01:34:58,000
swordfish though I know but I didn't do

2638
01:34:58,000 --> 01:35:00,000
anything for the cash or the swordfish

2639
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:02,000
I just came I just got here

2640
01:35:02,000 --> 01:35:04,000
um

2641
01:35:04,000 --> 01:35:06,000
wow level 60

2642
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:08,000
wow

2643
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:10,000
that's amazing

2644
01:35:10,000 --> 01:35:12,000
frickin 60

2645
01:35:12,000 --> 01:35:14,000
how many are we burn

2646
01:35:14,000 --> 01:35:16,000
or burn percentage is going up

2647
01:35:16,000 --> 01:35:18,000
oh cause I know swordfish is a bit harder

2648
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:20,000
than what was cooked

2649
01:35:20,000 --> 01:35:22,000
we are still doing

2650
01:35:22,000 --> 01:35:24,000
1000 an hour

2651
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:26,000
it is possible I will beat

2652
01:35:26,000 --> 01:35:28,000
the swordfish stack before

2653
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:30,000
um

2654
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:32,000
um

2655
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:34,000
just saying the chat that

2656
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:36,000
gave you the JP is 20 times

2657
01:35:36,000 --> 01:35:38,000
killer than me

2658
01:35:38,000 --> 01:35:40,000
um

2659
01:35:40,000 --> 01:35:42,000
yeah basic management stuff

2660
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:44,000
um

2661
01:35:44,000 --> 01:35:46,000
yes

2662
01:35:46,000 --> 01:35:48,000
I'm putting their stuff live

2663
01:35:48,000 --> 01:35:50,000
probably after the stream

2664
01:35:50,000 --> 01:35:52,000
um because I need it to go up

2665
01:35:52,000 --> 01:35:54,000
24 hours because

2666
01:35:54,000 --> 01:35:56,000
so youtube says they need to approve the membership

2667
01:35:56,000 --> 01:35:58,000
tiers but they don't approve

2668
01:35:58,000 --> 01:36:00,000
nothing they literally

2669
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:02,000
um can go for it

2670
01:36:02,000 --> 01:36:04,000
level 99 by the end of the stream

2671
01:36:04,000 --> 01:36:06,000
trust just doing endurance stream right after

2672
01:36:06,000 --> 01:36:08,000
closing the endurance stream honestly

2673
01:36:08,000 --> 01:36:10,000
uh

2674
01:36:10,000 --> 01:36:12,000
I could never do this

2675
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:14,000
I'm just giving it a shot it's always been a childhood

2676
01:36:14,000 --> 01:36:16,000
dream of kind of like

2677
01:36:16,000 --> 01:36:18,000
reaching 99 in any level

2678
01:36:18,000 --> 01:36:20,000
as you can see we haven't even touched

2679
01:36:20,000 --> 01:36:22,000
any of the member skills

2680
01:36:22,000 --> 01:36:24,000
but um

2681
01:36:24,000 --> 01:36:26,000
my combat is so low

2682
01:36:26,000 --> 01:36:28,000
but literally having it up here

2683
01:36:28,000 --> 01:36:30,000
is really nice um

2684
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:32,000
and I picked cooking because

2685
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:34,000
um I have incredibly

2686
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:36,000
baby memories

2687
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:38,000
of me being outside

2688
01:36:38,000 --> 01:36:40,000
the back of lumbridge castle

2689
01:36:40,000 --> 01:36:42,000
and I had

2690
01:36:42,000 --> 01:36:44,000
my pickaxe

2691
01:36:44,000 --> 01:36:46,000
I had my tinder box I had my

2692
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:48,000
my little basic bronze

2693
01:36:48,000 --> 01:36:50,000
sword and I used

2694
01:36:50,000 --> 01:36:52,000
to um kill the big

2695
01:36:52,000 --> 01:36:54,000
rats outside the back of the castle

2696
01:36:54,000 --> 01:36:56,000
cook them and I think

2697
01:36:56,000 --> 01:36:58,000
the highest cooking level I ever got

2698
01:36:58,000 --> 01:37:00,000
was 40 as a child

2699
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:02,000
um which is

2700
01:37:02,000 --> 01:37:04,000
just freaking adorable which is

2701
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:06,000
why I want cooking 99

2702
01:37:06,000 --> 01:37:08,000
first because I've just enjoyed it

2703
01:37:08,000 --> 01:37:10,000
literally these gender norms have hands

2704
01:37:10,000 --> 01:37:12,000
of course the whamen picks cooking

2705
01:37:12,000 --> 01:37:14,000
oh we're about to get to 9000

2706
01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:16,000
the stack is getting

2707
01:37:16,000 --> 01:37:18,000
weir it's getting smaller

2708
01:37:18,000 --> 01:37:20,000
getting a wee wee stack

2709
01:37:20,000 --> 01:37:22,000
burnt swordfish is probably

2710
01:37:22,000 --> 01:37:24,000
worth more than cooked on the open market

2711
01:37:24,000 --> 01:37:26,000
these burnt food collectors are pretty

2712
01:37:26,000 --> 01:37:28,000
oh I'm aware about the burnt food

2713
01:37:28,000 --> 01:37:30,000
collectors um

2714
01:37:30,000 --> 01:37:32,000
and they just give you a price for it

2715
01:37:32,000 --> 01:37:34,000
which is pretty crazy

2716
01:37:34,000 --> 01:37:36,000
um fire making is

2717
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:38,000
probably the next fast this is

2718
01:37:38,000 --> 01:37:40,000
winter tod yes

2719
01:37:40,000 --> 01:37:42,000
that was a ghost fires in winter tod

2720
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:44,000
or am I making that up

2721
01:37:44,000 --> 01:37:46,000
I might be making that up

2722
01:37:46,000 --> 01:37:48,000
I'm gonna be honest

2723
01:37:48,000 --> 01:37:50,000
I might be going crazy

2724
01:37:50,000 --> 01:37:52,000
uh my current level

2725
01:37:52,000 --> 01:37:54,000
is 60 on the dot

2726
01:37:54,000 --> 01:37:56,000
I did title the stream

2727
01:37:56,000 --> 01:37:58,000
70 question mark

2728
01:37:58,000 --> 01:38:00,000
but someone did napkin math

2729
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:02,000
and said if I finish cooking all these

2730
01:38:02,000 --> 01:38:04,000
swordfish I might be

2731
01:38:04,000 --> 01:38:06,000
78 which is just

2732
01:38:06,000 --> 01:38:08,000
fantastic truly

2733
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:10,000
um

2734
01:38:10,000 --> 01:38:12,000
but I thought the cooking

2735
01:38:12,000 --> 01:38:14,000
thing was a meta meme like mommy knows

2736
01:38:14,000 --> 01:38:16,000
how to cook here is the proof

2737
01:38:16,000 --> 01:38:18,000
I mean honestly we could do it that way as well

2738
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:20,000
but I kinda did it as like oh these gender

2739
01:38:20,000 --> 01:38:22,000
norms have hands I just really enjoy cooking

2740
01:38:22,000 --> 01:38:24,000
like I know there's

2741
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:26,000
this in real life runescape chick

2742
01:38:26,000 --> 01:38:28,000
and she has massive knockers

2743
01:38:28,000 --> 01:38:30,000
I'm talking a zero level knockers

2744
01:38:30,000 --> 01:38:32,000
and I used to just sit and watch her cook

2745
01:38:32,000 --> 01:38:34,000
lobsters

2746
01:38:34,000 --> 01:38:36,000
and like so many people would come in the chat

2747
01:38:36,000 --> 01:38:38,000
and say such horrendous things

2748
01:38:38,000 --> 01:38:40,000
when would it be the best food for winter tod

2749
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:42,000
so we keep

2750
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:44,000
oh gimli give it a rest

2751
01:38:44,000 --> 01:38:46,000
darling I cannae have you in the room

2752
01:38:46,000 --> 01:38:48,000
she's

2753
01:38:48,000 --> 01:38:50,000
she's losing it

2754
01:38:50,000 --> 01:38:52,000
she's losing it I don't know if it's coming up in the

2755
01:38:52,000 --> 01:38:54,000
microphone or not but she's losing it

2756
01:38:54,000 --> 01:38:56,000
and this is

2757
01:38:56,000 --> 01:38:58,000
I shouldn't have let her in because now it's gonna take

2758
01:38:58,000 --> 01:39:00,000
a couple of days for her to unlearn that she's

2759
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:02,000
allowed in this room

2760
01:39:02,000 --> 01:39:04,000
ah gimli I can't hear her

2761
01:39:04,000 --> 01:39:06,000
okay she's currently behind the door going

2762
01:39:06,000 --> 01:39:08,000
meh

2763
01:39:08,000 --> 01:39:10,000
basically

2764
01:39:10,000 --> 01:39:12,000
um

2765
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:14,000
she should have given up by now

2766
01:39:14,000 --> 01:39:16,000
and it's been

2767
01:39:16,000 --> 01:39:18,000
it's been quite a while

2768
01:39:18,000 --> 01:39:20,000
she should have gone to sleep I'm gonna be

2769
01:39:20,000 --> 01:39:22,000
honest

2770
01:39:22,000 --> 01:39:24,000
I should have played with her more

2771
01:39:24,000 --> 01:39:26,000
I thought I ran out of time because I was making a cup

2772
01:39:26,000 --> 01:39:28,000
of tea but I did feed her and

2773
01:39:28,000 --> 01:39:30,000
I threw the mouse a few times to give her a few laps

2774
01:39:30,000 --> 01:39:32,000
around through her dog

2775
01:39:32,000 --> 01:39:34,000
she's not a dog she's a cat

2776
01:39:36,000 --> 01:39:38,000
heaven forbid some tatas

2777
01:39:38,000 --> 01:39:40,000
admit it we're all gimli

2778
01:39:40,000 --> 01:39:42,000
I was kind of

2779
01:39:42,000 --> 01:39:44,000
I was like talking to

2780
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:46,000
um Vigo

2781
01:39:46,000 --> 01:39:48,000
and

2782
01:39:48,000 --> 01:39:50,000
he gets really excited when I finish

2783
01:39:50,000 --> 01:39:52,000
a stream

2784
01:39:52,000 --> 01:39:54,000
and I was just talking to him and I'm like

2785
01:39:54,000 --> 01:39:56,000
oh baby boy and I was petting him

2786
01:39:56,000 --> 01:39:58,000
and he was purring

2787
01:39:58,000 --> 01:40:00,000
and I was like I need to

2788
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:02,000
I've got two baby boys I've got

2789
01:40:02,000 --> 01:40:04,000

01:40:06,000 --> 01:40:08,000
and I need to split my time

2792
01:40:08,000 --> 01:40:10,000
between them

2793
01:40:10,000 --> 01:40:12,000
between us

2794
01:40:12,000 --> 01:40:14,000
so it's really adorable

2795
01:40:14,000 --> 01:40:16,000
he's such a good boy honestly he's like

2796
01:40:16,000 --> 01:40:18,000
um

2797
01:40:18,000 --> 01:40:20,000
de-refling are you there muggers

2798
01:40:20,000 --> 01:40:22,000
get to that man whoever de-refling is

2799
01:40:22,000 --> 01:40:24,000
because he'll give you jewellery

2800
01:40:24,000 --> 01:40:26,000
um

2801
01:40:26,000 --> 01:40:28,000
cute female kangaroo called Gimli

2802
01:40:28,000 --> 01:40:30,000
she's a refling too never give up

2803
01:40:30,000 --> 01:40:32,000
but she's got the

2804
01:40:32,000 --> 01:40:34,000
she got that dog you know

2805
01:40:34,000 --> 01:40:36,000
real cat girl is someone from

2806
01:40:36,000 --> 01:40:38,000
Gimli when I was actually

2807
01:40:38,000 --> 01:40:40,000
gonna do an in real life

2808
01:40:40,000 --> 01:40:42,000
video where I put

2809
01:40:42,000 --> 01:40:44,000
um

2810
01:40:44,000 --> 01:40:46,000
a licky lick on the 3d o ears

2811
01:40:46,000 --> 01:40:48,000
and then both my cats will lick it

2812
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:50,000
I don't know if YouTube will be weird

2813
01:40:50,000 --> 01:40:52,000
about it because I

2814
01:40:52,000 --> 01:40:54,000
don't know what's going on with your lickin in YouTube

2815
01:40:54,000 --> 01:40:56,000
right now it's absolutely terrifying

2816
01:40:56,000 --> 01:40:58,000
um

2817
01:40:58,000 --> 01:41:00,000
I don't

2818
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:02,000
oh I keep messing that up

2819
01:41:02,000 --> 01:41:04,000
sorry oh my god I'm not

2820
01:41:04,000 --> 01:41:06,000
time maxing okay she's now knocking on the door

2821
01:41:06,000 --> 01:41:08,000
Gimli

2822
01:41:08,000 --> 01:41:10,000
don't do that

2823
01:41:12,000 --> 01:41:14,000
ah

2824
01:41:14,000 --> 01:41:16,000
mommy's no impressed Gimli didn't he do that

2825
01:41:16,000 --> 01:41:18,000
he didn't have litter in yesterday

2826
01:41:18,000 --> 01:41:20,000
it opened a can of worms

2827
01:41:20,000 --> 01:41:22,000
oh

2828
01:41:24,000 --> 01:41:26,000
um but yeah I thought

2829
01:41:26,000 --> 01:41:28,000
can we see them the next hand cam

2830
01:41:28,000 --> 01:41:30,000
you saw Gimli's back

2831
01:41:30,000 --> 01:41:32,000
in the food

2832
01:41:32,000 --> 01:41:34,000
in the celebration stream near the end of it

2833
01:41:34,000 --> 01:41:36,000
you saw Gimli come in the room but had to take her out

2834
01:41:36,000 --> 01:41:38,000
she was gonna knock over the webcam

2835
01:41:38,000 --> 01:41:40,000
um I do have a picture of them

2836
01:41:40,000 --> 01:41:42,000
um

2837
01:41:42,000 --> 01:41:44,000
they killed a rat

2838
01:41:44,000 --> 01:41:46,000
um so I thought

2839
01:41:46,000 --> 01:41:48,000
Gimli was the hunter but no

2840
01:41:48,000 --> 01:41:50,000
uh Vigo was the hunter

2841
01:41:50,000 --> 01:41:52,000
he caught a rat

2842
01:41:52,000 --> 01:41:54,000
in the garden I didn't even

2843
01:41:54,000 --> 01:41:56,000
know it was there

2844
01:41:56,000 --> 01:41:58,000
and he destroyed it

2845
01:41:58,000 --> 01:42:00,000
so quickly

2846
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:02,000
um I'm pretty sure he like

2847
01:42:02,000 --> 01:42:04,000
so if he didn't know

2848
01:42:04,000 --> 01:42:06,000
the way that cats hunt

2849
01:42:06,000 --> 01:42:08,000
is they apply pressure on the throat

2850
01:42:08,000 --> 01:42:10,000
of the prey

2851
01:42:10,000 --> 01:42:12,000
so basically

2852
01:42:12,000 --> 01:42:14,000
it gets either suffocated

2853
01:42:14,000 --> 01:42:16,000
or you know damaged

2854
01:42:16,000 --> 01:42:18,000
out which is a shame to say

2855
01:42:18,000 --> 01:42:20,000
Vigo

2856
01:42:20,000 --> 01:42:22,000
I let him out in the garden

2857
01:42:22,000 --> 01:42:24,000
and within 10 seconds

2858
01:42:24,000 --> 01:42:26,000
he had perished

2859
01:42:26,000 --> 01:42:28,000
the the rat

2860
01:42:28,000 --> 01:42:30,000
I didn't I have a picture of it I'll maybe post it

2861
01:42:30,000 --> 01:42:32,000
but I know people don't like seeing dead animals

2862
01:42:32,000 --> 01:42:34,000
so maybe it's not too nice

2863
01:42:34,000 --> 01:42:36,000
maybe I'll put like a little black bar

2864
01:42:36,000 --> 01:42:38,000
over the rat's eyes just to

2865
01:42:38,000 --> 01:42:40,000
protect its identity you know

2866
01:42:40,000 --> 01:42:42,000
and it respect its wee family

2867
01:42:42,000 --> 01:42:44,000
um

2868
01:42:44,000 --> 01:42:46,000
damn though put it in me base

2869
01:42:46,000 --> 01:42:48,000
cat almost

2870
01:42:48,000 --> 01:42:50,000
stalks you honestly

2871
01:42:50,000 --> 01:42:52,000
um

2872
01:42:54,000 --> 01:42:56,000
wait cat almost stalks me

2873
01:42:56,000 --> 01:42:58,000
are you that fucking fanny

2874
01:42:58,000 --> 01:43:00,000
honestly if you are go and just leave me alone

2875
01:43:00,000 --> 01:43:02,000
um

2876
01:43:02,000 --> 01:43:04,000
but yeah we

2877
01:43:04,000 --> 01:43:06,000
uh

2878
01:43:06,000 --> 01:43:08,000
we Gimli we Vigo

2879
01:43:08,000 --> 01:43:10,000
um

2880
01:43:10,000 --> 01:43:12,000
is there somewhere we can

2881
01:43:12,000 --> 01:43:14,000
send cat pics I mean you can just

2882
01:43:14,000 --> 01:43:16,000
at me

2883
01:43:16,000 --> 01:43:18,000
it's fine on twitter

2884
01:43:18,000 --> 01:43:20,000
uh

2885
01:43:20,000 --> 01:43:22,000
honestly honestly

2886
01:43:26,000 --> 01:43:28,000
my cat is being a menace to the local bird

2887
01:43:28,000 --> 01:43:30,000
population it's illegal

2888
01:43:30,000 --> 01:43:32,000
to let your cats outside

2889
01:43:32,000 --> 01:43:34,000
in Australia or

2890
01:43:34,000 --> 01:43:36,000
I don't know if it's just in

2891
01:43:36,000 --> 01:43:38,000
Victoria but it's illegal

2892
01:43:38,000 --> 01:43:40,000
to let them out

2893
01:43:40,000 --> 01:43:42,000
so I have a caged off

2894
01:43:42,000 --> 01:43:44,000
background

2895
01:43:44,000 --> 01:43:46,000
which is such a shame but I'd rather

2896
01:43:46,000 --> 01:43:48,000
they get outside time than know outside time

2897
01:43:48,000 --> 01:43:50,000
at all because I actually don't think it's natural

2898
01:43:50,000 --> 01:43:52,000
for cats to be inside

2899
01:43:52,000 --> 01:43:54,000
um

2900
01:43:54,000 --> 01:43:56,000
but yeah they made it illegal

2901
01:43:58,000 --> 01:44:00,000
um

2902
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:02,000
Australia does have a wild cat problem

2903
01:44:02,000 --> 01:44:04,000
oh my god it's so sad I wish I didn't

2904
01:44:04,000 --> 01:44:06,000
learn about it but they basically

2905
01:44:06,000 --> 01:44:08,000
call wild cats instead of just

2906
01:44:08,000 --> 01:44:10,000
doing capture and release because it's

2907
01:44:10,000 --> 01:44:12,000
like so out of control type thing

2908
01:44:12,000 --> 01:44:14,000
and I'm like

2909
01:44:14,000 --> 01:44:16,000
bruh bruh

2910
01:44:16,000 --> 01:44:18,000
although it's kind of like learning

2911
01:44:18,000 --> 01:44:20,000
about cat island in Japan

2912
01:44:20,000 --> 01:44:22,000
there's a tourist state island

2913
01:44:22,000 --> 01:44:24,000
called cat island but the problem

2914
01:44:24,000 --> 01:44:26,000
is none of the cats are

2915
01:44:26,000 --> 01:44:28,000
fled or looked after or new urge so the

2916
01:44:28,000 --> 01:44:30,000
population is completely out of control

2917
01:44:30,000 --> 01:44:32,000
oh my god Gimli

2918
01:44:32,000 --> 01:44:34,000
she's

2919
01:44:34,000 --> 01:44:36,000
doing my head and

2920
01:44:36,000 --> 01:44:38,000
oh my

2921
01:44:38,000 --> 01:44:40,000
god

2922
01:44:40,000 --> 01:44:42,000
Gimli

2923
01:44:42,000 --> 01:44:44,000
I know you guys might not be able to

2924
01:44:44,000 --> 01:44:46,000
hear her she's going to absolutely

2925
01:44:46,000 --> 01:44:48,000
desert right now she should have given up

2926
01:44:48,000 --> 01:44:50,000
like a long time ago and gone back to sleep

2927
01:44:50,000 --> 01:44:52,000
what have I done I've created a monster

2928
01:44:52,000 --> 01:44:54,000
because nobody wants to see

2929
01:44:54,000 --> 01:44:56,000
mushroom no more he's chopped live

2930
01:44:56,000 --> 01:44:58,000
I don't know the rest of the words

2931
01:44:58,000 --> 01:45:00,000
I'm back

2932
01:45:00,000 --> 01:45:02,000
baby

2933
01:45:04,000 --> 01:45:06,000
um

2934
01:45:06,000 --> 01:45:08,000
oh my god I can't think when she's

2935
01:45:08,000 --> 01:45:10,000
me on wait hold on

2936
01:45:12,000 --> 01:45:14,000
right she be I don't need to

2937
01:45:14,000 --> 01:45:16,000
do her monetization

2938
01:45:22,000 --> 01:45:24,000
okay I don't need to worry about sheepsters

2939
01:45:24,000 --> 01:45:26,000
but I will be putting

2940
01:45:26,000 --> 01:45:28,000
me and AC's thing

2941
01:45:28,000 --> 01:45:30,000
live

2942
01:45:30,000 --> 01:45:32,000
praying that a speller member names right

2943
01:45:32,000 --> 01:45:34,000
but I'm pretty sure it's

2944
01:45:34,000 --> 01:45:36,000
snow bear ease

2945
01:45:36,000 --> 01:45:38,000
and

2946
01:45:38,000 --> 01:45:40,000
pin pals

2947
01:45:40,000 --> 01:45:42,000
snippets to me and

2948
01:45:42,000 --> 01:45:44,000
moose

2949
01:45:44,000 --> 01:45:46,000
should have picked any kind of youtube

2950
01:45:46,000 --> 01:45:48,000
to be further driving the birds

2951
01:45:48,000 --> 01:45:50,000
extinct yes I just think

2952
01:45:50,000 --> 01:45:52,000
it's very dramatic

2953
01:45:52,000 --> 01:45:54,000
to not only cast it

2954
01:45:54,000 --> 01:45:56,000
you've been telling me I've been breaking the law for the past

2955
01:45:56,000 --> 01:45:58,000
23 years and didn't know

2956
01:45:58,000 --> 01:46:00,000
yeah like apparently it's gonna slow and

2957
01:46:00,000 --> 01:46:02,000
England just made it that your cat has

2958
01:46:02,000 --> 01:46:04,000
to get microchipped now

2959
01:46:04,000 --> 01:46:06,000
and I'm like interesting

2960
01:46:06,000 --> 01:46:08,000
but what's

2961
01:46:08,000 --> 01:46:10,000
the real reason behind that because

2962
01:46:10,000 --> 01:46:12,000
is it just like another tax on pet

2963
01:46:12,000 --> 01:46:14,000
owners

2964
01:46:14,000 --> 01:46:16,000
oh if you're a pet owner and you need

2965
01:46:16,000 --> 01:46:18,000
to use litter by the way like a litter box

2966
01:46:18,000 --> 01:46:20,000
you know how it's really

2967
01:46:20,000 --> 01:46:22,000
expensive for litter box

2968
01:46:22,000 --> 01:46:24,000
like pellets and all that

2969
01:46:24,000 --> 01:46:26,000
play sand

2970
01:46:26,000 --> 01:46:28,000
cats love to take big massive dookies

2971
01:46:28,000 --> 01:46:30,000
in play sand which is the cheapest thing

2972
01:46:30,000 --> 01:46:32,000
ever it lasts so long

2973
01:46:32,000 --> 01:46:34,000
especially if you can have an

2974
01:46:34,000 --> 01:46:36,000
outside litter tree for them if they have

2975
01:46:36,000 --> 01:46:38,000
access to outside

2976
01:46:38,000 --> 01:46:40,000
you will save literally hundreds

2977
01:46:40,000 --> 01:46:42,000
upon thousands of dollars over

2978
01:46:42,000 --> 01:46:44,000
the years

2979
01:46:44,000 --> 01:46:46,000
it costs 8 dollars

2980
01:46:46,000 --> 01:46:48,000
for a bag of sand and it costs

2981
01:46:48,000 --> 01:46:50,000
20 for a decent cat grit

2982
01:46:50,000 --> 01:46:52,000
just give them sand

2983
01:46:52,000 --> 01:46:54,000
they love it you can scoop it

2984
01:46:54,000 --> 01:46:56,000
it's super good

2985
01:46:56,000 --> 01:46:58,000
and it saves your pockets

2986
01:46:58,000 --> 01:47:00,000
so much money because

2987
01:47:00,000 --> 01:47:02,000
there's such a tax on pet owners

2988
01:47:02,000 --> 01:47:04,000
the only thing I haven't figured out yet

2989
01:47:04,000 --> 01:47:06,000
is how to get good quality food

2990
01:47:06,000 --> 01:47:08,000
because

2991
01:47:08,000 --> 01:47:10,000
I was actually thinking

2992
01:47:10,000 --> 01:47:12,000
of making like homemade cat

2993
01:47:12,000 --> 01:47:14,000
the fire

2994
01:47:14,000 --> 01:47:16,000
is gone no

2995
01:47:16,000 --> 01:47:18,000
rifling what happened

2996
01:47:18,000 --> 01:47:20,000
wait let me pick up the ashes hold on

2997
01:47:20,000 --> 01:47:22,000
wait I can't I've got too much swordfish

2998
01:47:22,000 --> 01:47:24,000
wait hold on hold on

2999
01:47:24,000 --> 01:47:26,000
I'll pick up the ashes and take them out the way

3000
01:47:26,000 --> 01:47:28,000
I need to put them out the way ok

3001
01:47:28,000 --> 01:47:30,000
now the ashes are out the way

3002
01:47:30,000 --> 01:47:32,000
no the embers have went out

3003
01:47:32,000 --> 01:47:34,000
I've just picked up burnt fish as well by accident

3004
01:47:36,000 --> 01:47:38,000
slim cuttles

3005
01:47:38,000 --> 01:47:40,000
or strong shady

3006
01:47:40,000 --> 01:47:42,000
excellent cuttle sounds better

3007
01:47:44,000 --> 01:47:46,000
always thought it would be cute to have a big

3008
01:47:46,000 --> 01:47:48,000
chunky cat

3009
01:47:48,000 --> 01:47:50,000
oh well thanks for the tip

3010
01:47:50,000 --> 01:47:52,000
I can't even remember what the tip was

3011
01:47:52,000 --> 01:47:54,000
thank you for putting the fire back on again rifling

3012
01:47:54,000 --> 01:47:56,000
it's over

3013
01:47:56,000 --> 01:47:58,000
they didn't kindle the fire

3014
01:47:58,000 --> 01:48:00,000
now it's the age of darkness

3015
01:48:00,000 --> 01:48:02,000
crazy concept

3016
01:48:02,000 --> 01:48:04,000
go fishin

3017
01:48:04,000 --> 01:48:06,000
the riflings would happily taste test

3018
01:48:06,000 --> 01:48:08,000
your homemade cat food yeah

3019
01:48:08,000 --> 01:48:10,000
I wanted to make homemade thank you for getting me back

3020
01:48:10,000 --> 01:48:12,000
on the subject because I completely forgot

3021
01:48:12,000 --> 01:48:14,000
what I was rambling about

3022
01:48:14,000 --> 01:48:16,000
I

3023
01:48:16,000 --> 01:48:18,000
wanted to make homemade cat food

3024
01:48:18,000 --> 01:48:20,000
because they were struggling to eat

3025
01:48:20,000 --> 01:48:22,000
like that pre-made stuff

3026
01:48:22,000 --> 01:48:24,000
and the thing

3027
01:48:24,000 --> 01:48:26,000
this sounds really bad

3028
01:48:26,000 --> 01:48:28,000
but on the boxes of cat food

3029
01:48:28,000 --> 01:48:30,000
it says not fit for human consumption

3030
01:48:30,000 --> 01:48:32,000
ok

3031
01:48:32,000 --> 01:48:34,000
now the reason why that

3032
01:48:34,000 --> 01:48:36,000
alarms me is because I would never

3033
01:48:36,000 --> 01:48:38,000
want to give my cat something that I couldn't

3034
01:48:38,000 --> 01:48:40,000
eat and cats eat meat cats are

3035
01:48:42,000 --> 01:48:44,000
wow 61

3036
01:48:44,000 --> 01:48:46,000
thank you

3037
01:48:46,000 --> 01:48:48,000
thank you riflings for funding my

3038
01:48:48,000 --> 01:48:50,000
cooking habit

3039
01:48:52,000 --> 01:48:54,000
yeah I just find it

3040
01:48:54,000 --> 01:48:56,000
a bit hmm

3041
01:48:56,000 --> 01:48:58,000
and sus

3042
01:48:58,000 --> 01:49:00,000
that

3043
01:49:00,000 --> 01:49:02,000
it's not fit for human consumption

3044
01:49:02,000 --> 01:49:04,000
when the content is just supposed to be meat

3045
01:49:04,000 --> 01:49:06,000
that's possible for

3046
01:49:06,000 --> 01:49:08,000
cats to eat

3047
01:49:08,000 --> 01:49:10,000
which I don't like

3048
01:49:10,000 --> 01:49:12,000
VV buys a rotisserie chicken

3049
01:49:12,000 --> 01:49:14,000
cats didn't like

3050
01:49:14,000 --> 01:49:16,000
I fed them it

3051
01:49:16,000 --> 01:49:18,000
you know who liked

3052
01:49:18,000 --> 01:49:20,000
more than my cats

3053
01:49:20,000 --> 01:49:22,000
the magpies

3054
01:49:22,000 --> 01:49:24,000
which I've yet to name

3055
01:49:24,000 --> 01:49:26,000
it's

3056
01:49:26,000 --> 01:49:28,000
a husband magpie

3057
01:49:28,000 --> 01:49:30,000
a wife magpie and a daughter magpie

3058
01:49:30,000 --> 01:49:32,000
that visits me

3059
01:49:32,000 --> 01:49:34,000
oh no

3060
01:49:36,000 --> 01:49:38,000
rifling

3061
01:49:38,000 --> 01:49:40,000
is the rifling afk that normally does

3062
01:49:40,000 --> 01:49:42,000
like the big log pile

3063
01:49:42,000 --> 01:49:44,000
wait I'll clear away the ashes hold on

3064
01:49:44,000 --> 01:49:46,000
there you go it's out of the way

3065
01:49:46,000 --> 01:49:48,000
I keep clicking collect

3066
01:49:48,000 --> 01:49:50,000
bank banker

3067
01:49:50,000 --> 01:49:52,000
take that out then take it raw

3068
01:49:52,000 --> 01:49:54,000
ooh we're at 9.8

3069
01:49:56,000 --> 01:49:58,000

3070
01:49:58,000 --> 01:50:00,000
we're so on fire

3071
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:02,000
praise the fire praise the sun

3072
01:50:04,000 --> 01:50:06,000
pet food in general

3073
01:50:06,000 --> 01:50:08,000
is a rarity

3074
01:50:08,000 --> 01:50:10,000
affordable

3075
01:50:10,000 --> 01:50:12,000
mmm it's like ridiculous pricing

3076
01:50:12,000 --> 01:50:14,000
as well like I'm not happy with the price as well

3077
01:50:14,000 --> 01:50:16,000
but I thought it would be really cute

3078
01:50:16,000 --> 01:50:18,000
to make like

3079
01:50:18,000 --> 01:50:20,000
homemade cat food for them

3080
01:50:20,000 --> 01:50:22,000
it wouldn't be the best but like I've seen

3081
01:50:22,000 --> 01:50:24,000
this youtube channel

3082
01:50:24,000 --> 01:50:26,000
I think it's called June's Kitchen

3083
01:50:26,000 --> 01:50:28,000
and it's literally dedicated

3084
01:50:28,000 --> 01:50:30,000
to feeding the cats

3085
01:50:30,000 --> 01:50:32,000
gourmet homemade food

3086
01:50:32,000 --> 01:50:34,000
and it's the most adorable thing ever

3087
01:50:34,000 --> 01:50:36,000
and I'm like that's what I want to do for V going in

3088
01:50:36,000 --> 01:50:38,000
cats are hyper carnivores

3089
01:50:38,000 --> 01:50:40,000
yes carnivores

3090
01:50:40,000 --> 01:50:42,000

3091
01:50:42,000 --> 01:50:44,000
but omnivores is both

3092
01:50:44,000 --> 01:50:46,000

01:53:30,000 --> 01:53:32,000
is browse feature just like in the side

3162
01:53:32,000 --> 01:53:34,000
window

3163
01:53:34,000 --> 01:53:36,000
probably hit the algorithm

3164
01:53:36,000 --> 01:53:38,000
it was good

3165
01:53:38,000 --> 01:53:40,000
oh

3166
01:53:40,000 --> 01:53:42,000
I'm at 6k I've not even done the first

3167
01:53:42,000 --> 01:53:44,000
thank you celebration

3168
01:53:44,000 --> 01:53:46,000
what oh wait

3169
01:53:46,000 --> 01:53:48,000
hold on let me screenshot this so you guys

3170
01:53:48,000 --> 01:53:50,000
can see what I see you can see

3171
01:53:50,000 --> 01:53:52,000
I'm not

3172
01:53:52,000 --> 01:53:54,000
I'm not a secret

3173
01:53:54,000 --> 01:53:56,000
kind of creator I'll show you what I see

3174
01:53:56,000 --> 01:53:58,000
this is what I see on the video

3175
01:53:58,000 --> 01:54:00,000
it hasn't updated the

3176
01:54:00,000 --> 01:54:02,000
where is it

3177
01:54:06,000 --> 01:54:08,000
it hasn't

3178
01:54:08,000 --> 01:54:10,000
ah

3179
01:54:10,000 --> 01:54:12,000
that would be too easy wouldn't it

3180
01:54:12,000 --> 01:54:14,000
image make source

3181
01:54:14,000 --> 01:54:16,000
this is just youtube stats

3182
01:54:16,000 --> 01:54:18,000
video I guess

3183
01:54:18,000 --> 01:54:20,000
okay

3184
01:54:20,000 --> 01:54:22,000
and then pick this one on my desktop please

3185
01:54:22,000 --> 01:54:24,000
is that it

3186
01:54:24,000 --> 01:54:26,000
this video

3187
01:54:26,000 --> 01:54:28,000
wow

3188
01:54:28,000 --> 01:54:30,000
what on earth

3189
01:54:30,000 --> 01:54:32,000
do you see that

3190
01:54:36,000 --> 01:54:38,000
holy

3191
01:54:38,000 --> 01:54:40,000
what on earth

3192
01:54:40,000 --> 01:54:42,000
that got pushed so much

3193
01:54:42,000 --> 01:54:44,000
look at browse feature

3194
01:54:44,000 --> 01:54:46,000
76 percent

3195
01:54:46,000 --> 01:54:48,000
browse feature my goodness

3196
01:54:48,000 --> 01:54:50,000
but look

3197
01:54:50,000 --> 01:54:52,000
it says I got 300 subscribers

3198
01:54:52,000 --> 01:54:54,000
for it the money hasn't

3199
01:54:54,000 --> 01:54:56,000
updated because it takes like 48 hours

3200
01:54:56,000 --> 01:54:58,000
for the money to show

3201
01:54:58,000 --> 01:55:00,000
wow I did not expect that

3202
01:55:00,000 --> 01:55:02,000
the fact

3203
01:55:02,000 --> 01:55:04,000
the watch time is 1.8k

3204
01:55:04,000 --> 01:55:06,000
hours if you didn't know to get monetized

3205
01:55:06,000 --> 01:55:08,000
you need 3k watch hours

3206
01:55:08,000 --> 01:55:10,000
holy crap

3207
01:55:10,000 --> 01:55:12,000
maybe

3208
01:55:12,000 --> 01:55:14,000
maybe gen 2 should come out with an ASMR

3209
01:55:14,000 --> 01:55:16,000
video before debut but kind of ruins the

3210
01:55:16,000 --> 01:55:18,000
voice although saying that you hear the voice

3211
01:55:18,000 --> 01:55:20,000
in the trailer in the shorts anyways

3212
01:55:20,000 --> 01:55:22,000
that much of a deal because it might help with the culling

3213
01:55:22,000 --> 01:55:24,000
if the girls came out with an ASMR video

3214
01:55:24,000 --> 01:55:26,000
for gen 2

3215
01:55:26,000 --> 01:55:28,000
nice when quality

3216
01:55:28,000 --> 01:55:30,000
is rewarded but look at that

3217
01:55:30,000 --> 01:55:32,000
a browse feature

3218
01:55:32,000 --> 01:55:34,000
source that's pretty

3219
01:55:34,000 --> 01:55:36,000
that's pretty nice

3220
01:55:36,000 --> 01:55:38,000
sorry my tummy is rumbling if you heard that

3221
01:55:40,000 --> 01:55:42,000
literally I've not even got my first thank

3222
01:55:42,000 --> 01:55:44,000
you for 1k out yet

3223
01:55:44,000 --> 01:55:46,000
oh

3224
01:55:46,000 --> 01:55:48,000
oh my god

3225
01:55:48,000 --> 01:55:50,000
yeah whoa

3226
01:55:50,000 --> 01:55:52,000
I'm 5800 I literally

3227
01:55:52,000 --> 01:55:54,000
tweeted like thanks for 5k yesterday

3228
01:55:54,000 --> 01:55:56,000
holy crap

3229
01:55:56,000 --> 01:55:58,000
that's insane

3230
01:55:58,000 --> 01:56:00,000
your trailer hooked me pretty hard

3231
01:56:00,000 --> 01:56:02,000
yeah you're like I'm Scott

3232
01:56:02,000 --> 01:56:04,000
oh yeah

3233
01:56:04,000 --> 01:56:06,000
oh cloud he's Scott

3234
01:56:06,000 --> 01:56:08,000
win win

3235
01:56:08,000 --> 01:56:10,000
well I wasn't lying during debut

3236
01:56:10,000 --> 01:56:12,000
and I was like you'll be eating good if you're an ASMR

3237
01:56:12,000 --> 01:56:14,000
enthusiast

3238
01:56:14,000 --> 01:56:16,000
it's unlikely

3239
01:56:16,000 --> 01:56:18,000
I'll get that first video out today

3240
01:56:18,000 --> 01:56:20,000
because

3241
01:56:20,000 --> 01:56:22,000
I'm doing AC and Emmys membership

3242
01:56:22,000 --> 01:56:24,000
when I get offline

3243
01:56:24,000 --> 01:56:26,000
and then I'm probably collapsing

3244
01:56:26,000 --> 01:56:28,000
unless although I will say it's really

3245
01:56:28,000 --> 01:56:30,000
fun editing my

3246
01:56:30,000 --> 01:56:32,000
thank you videos because

3247
01:56:32,000 --> 01:56:34,000
I'm like

3248
01:56:34,000 --> 01:56:36,000
I'm not making it super professional

3249
01:56:36,000 --> 01:56:38,000
and like editing out all the bumps I'm just

3250
01:56:38,000 --> 01:56:40,000
lowering the bumps in that so it's still

3251
01:56:40,000 --> 01:56:42,000
like on the same level

3252
01:56:42,000 --> 01:56:44,000
the culling was so silly

3253
01:56:44,000 --> 01:56:46,000
it was absolutely insane

3254
01:56:46,000 --> 01:56:48,000
on AC

3255
01:56:48,000 --> 01:56:50,000
I mentioned this yesterday so don't worry

3256
01:56:50,000 --> 01:56:52,000
if you didn't hear it but AC

3257
01:56:52,000 --> 01:56:54,000
got called

3258
01:56:54,000 --> 01:56:56,000
1500 subscribers and on the same

3259
01:56:56,000 --> 01:56:58,000
day I got called 700

3260
01:56:58,000 --> 01:57:00,000
subscribers even though

3261
01:57:00,000 --> 01:57:02,000
she had more shorts out like I was

3262
01:57:02,000 --> 01:57:04,000
pushing shorts on AC

3263
01:57:04,000 --> 01:57:06,000
at the time

3264
01:57:06,000 --> 01:57:08,000
that's just crazy

3265
01:57:08,000 --> 01:57:10,000
do you love a cheeky bit of ASMR?

3266
01:57:14,000 --> 01:57:16,000
it was so rough on AC

3267
01:57:16,000 --> 01:57:18,000
but she's been doing fantastic honestly

3268
01:57:20,000 --> 01:57:22,000
I

3269
01:57:22,000 --> 01:57:24,000
am

3270
01:57:24,000 --> 01:57:26,000
still interested in a clipper program

3271
01:57:26,000 --> 01:57:28,000
for the girls

3272
01:57:28,000 --> 01:57:30,000
I'm just waiting for

3273
01:57:30,000 --> 01:57:32,000
the first month of income to come in

3274
01:57:32,000 --> 01:57:34,000
and then I can kind of open up pie charts

3275
01:57:34,000 --> 01:57:36,000
and be like right is this

3276
01:57:36,000 --> 01:57:38,000
going to be possible

3277
01:57:38,000 --> 01:57:40,000
for Vehler to do a clipping program

3278
01:57:40,000 --> 01:57:42,000
like Idol N has done because I really

3279
01:57:42,000 --> 01:57:44,000
like it I think it's a really good way

3280
01:57:44,000 --> 01:57:46,000
to get clippers involved and

3281
01:57:46,000 --> 01:57:48,000
help promote the girls

3282
01:57:48,000 --> 01:57:50,000
and all that jazz I think it's fantastic

3283
01:57:50,000 --> 01:57:52,000
so we are still looking into that

3284
01:57:52,000 --> 01:57:54,000
and hopefully it will

3285
01:57:54,000 --> 01:57:56,000
give the girls a cheeky boost

3286
01:57:58,000 --> 01:58:00,000
I've had to re-sub

3287
01:58:00,000 --> 01:58:02,000
three times yeah like every really

3288
01:58:02,000 --> 01:58:04,000
I had to freaking subscribe back onto the girls

3289
01:58:04,000 --> 01:58:06,000
at one point as well I was like bruh

3290
01:58:06,000 --> 01:58:08,000
we were literally all each other's first subscribers

3291
01:58:08,000 --> 01:58:10,000
and I got booted off and I'm like great

3292
01:58:10,000 --> 01:58:12,000
you've stolen it from me

3293
01:58:12,000 --> 01:58:14,000
you too

3294
01:58:14,000 --> 01:58:16,000
absolutely stolen it

3295
01:58:18,000 --> 01:58:20,000
I hope those missing 1,500

3296
01:58:20,000 --> 01:58:22,000
would you sans find their way to her

3297
01:58:22,000 --> 01:58:24,000
honestly though

3298
01:58:24,000 --> 01:58:26,000
I'm sure they will I'm sure they'll be like

3299
01:58:26,000 --> 01:58:28,000
hey wasn't there a cute polar bear around here

3300
01:58:28,000 --> 01:58:30,000
at one point

3301
01:58:30,000 --> 01:58:32,000
if you interact with the content

3302
01:58:32,000 --> 01:58:34,000
leave a like on stream

3303
01:58:34,000 --> 01:58:36,000
or leave a comment

3304
01:58:36,000 --> 01:58:38,000
then the algorithm will show the girl

3305
01:58:38,000 --> 01:58:40,000
more to you

3306
01:58:40,000 --> 01:58:42,000
so if you are an OG

3307
01:58:42,000 --> 01:58:44,000
you're like her streams are never showing up

3308
01:58:44,000 --> 01:58:46,000
please do consider like

3309
01:58:46,000 --> 01:58:48,000
just going on her short feed

3310
01:58:48,000 --> 01:58:50,000
for example

3311
01:58:50,000 --> 01:58:52,000
don't like the stuff right away

3312
01:58:52,000 --> 01:58:54,000
genuinely sit and watch it because if you don't

3313
01:58:54,000 --> 01:58:56,000
sit and watch it then the algorithm

3314
01:58:56,000 --> 01:58:58,000
knows that you are just sitting there

3315
01:58:58,000 --> 01:59:00,000
it's really annoying

3316
01:59:00,000 --> 01:59:02,000
but the algorithm is now too

3317
01:59:02,000 --> 01:59:04,000
advanced

3318
01:59:04,000 --> 01:59:06,000
because before way back

3319
01:59:06,000 --> 01:59:08,000
and much older youtube days

3320
01:59:08,000 --> 01:59:10,000
if you left a like

3321
01:59:10,000 --> 01:59:12,000
you left a like

3322
01:59:12,000 --> 01:59:14,000
but now the algorithm is like

3323
01:59:14,000 --> 01:59:16,000
this person left a like at the 2 minute mark

3324
01:59:16,000 --> 01:59:18,000
maybe something interesting happened 2 minutes in

3325
01:59:18,000 --> 01:59:20,000
ok because of that statistic

3326
01:59:20,000 --> 01:59:22,000
we're going to now

3327
01:59:22,000 --> 01:59:24,000
promote this video to

3328
01:59:24,000 --> 01:59:26,000
people who

3329
01:59:26,000 --> 01:59:28,000
have interacted with this vtuber

3330
01:59:28,000 --> 01:59:30,000
the algorithm just gets so

3331
01:59:30,000 --> 01:59:32,000
silly

3332
01:59:32,000 --> 01:59:34,000
I'm dying for the hypnovis

3333
01:59:34,000 --> 01:59:36,000
the hypnovis

3334
01:59:36,000 --> 01:59:38,000
can actually go on youtube

3335
01:59:38,000 --> 01:59:40,000
youtube allows hypnosis

3336
01:59:40,000 --> 01:59:42,000
patreon doesn't

3337
01:59:42,000 --> 01:59:44,000
make it make sense

3338
01:59:44,000 --> 01:59:46,000
but we love youtube out here for that reason

3339
01:59:46,000 --> 01:59:48,000
it's very

3340
01:59:48,000 --> 01:59:50,000
strange

3341
01:59:50,000 --> 01:59:52,000
probably the first hit

3342
01:59:52,000 --> 01:59:54,000
sorry

3343
01:59:54,000 --> 01:59:56,000
take this burnt swordfish

3344
01:59:56,000 --> 01:59:58,000
the first

3345
01:59:58,000 --> 02:00:00,000
ASMR I'm going to do is

3346
02:00:00,000 --> 02:00:02,000
forget your name

3347
02:00:02,000 --> 02:00:04,000
and replace it with reefling

3348
02:00:06,000 --> 02:00:08,000
I will not make it a permanent

3349
02:00:08,000 --> 02:00:10,000
effect

3350
02:00:10,000 --> 02:00:12,000
I will make it a session

3351
02:00:12,000 --> 02:00:14,000
I think maybe a 30 minute session

3352
02:00:14,000 --> 02:00:16,000
if you will

3353
02:00:18,000 --> 02:00:20,000
and I'll maybe give it like 2 hour

3354
02:00:20,000 --> 02:00:22,000
effect I really do not want to

3355
02:00:22,000 --> 02:00:24,000
mess around with permanent effects too much

3356
02:00:24,000 --> 02:00:26,000
it kind of scares me permanent effect

3357
02:00:26,000 --> 02:00:28,000
stuff I have to be honest I'm a bit of a scaredy cat

3358
02:00:28,000 --> 02:00:30,000
ooh our burn percentage

3359
02:00:30,000 --> 02:00:32,000
is up to 15

3360
02:00:32,000 --> 02:00:34,000
I think it's holding

3361
02:00:34,000 --> 02:00:36,000
steady at 15 though

3362
02:00:36,000 --> 02:00:38,000
and hopefully it'll lower as we

3363
02:00:38,000 --> 02:00:40,000
get more leveled up

3364
02:00:42,000 --> 02:00:44,000
wait no hypnosis no

3365
02:00:44,000 --> 02:00:46,000
hypnosis is ban

3366
02:00:46,000 --> 02:00:48,000
it is a bannable

3367
02:00:48,000 --> 02:00:50,000
offense

3368
02:00:50,000 --> 02:00:52,000
suspendable offense if you will

3369
02:00:52,000 --> 02:00:54,000
there was

3370
02:00:54,000 --> 02:00:56,000
a ASMRist actually that got

3371
02:00:56,000 --> 02:00:58,000
their entire patreon taken down

3372
02:00:58,000 --> 02:01:00,000
not even a chance to

3373
02:01:02,000 --> 02:01:04,000
appeal or

3374
02:01:04,000 --> 02:01:06,000
get suspended and then delete the content

3375
02:01:06,000 --> 02:01:08,000
sometimes patreon will suspend

3376
02:01:08,000 --> 02:01:10,000
your account until you

3377
02:01:10,000 --> 02:01:12,000
your content

3378
02:01:12,000 --> 02:01:14,000
applies to their tos so if it's not

3379
02:01:14,000 --> 02:01:16,000
too offensive whatever you've done or made

3380
02:01:16,000 --> 02:01:18,000
but

3381
02:01:18,000 --> 02:01:20,000
there wasn't ASMRist recently who got their

3382
02:01:20,000 --> 02:01:22,000
entire thing just taken down which was

3383
02:01:22,000 --> 02:01:24,000
pretty crazy

3384
02:01:24,000 --> 02:01:26,000
just making me permanently less procrastinate

3385
02:01:28,000 --> 02:01:30,000
yeah honestly only a bit of mind break

3386
02:01:30,000 --> 02:01:32,000
I feel you

3387
02:01:32,000 --> 02:01:34,000
yeah a chubby

3388
02:01:34,000 --> 02:01:36,000
weight gain that got

3389
02:01:36,000 --> 02:01:38,000
taken away

3390
02:01:38,000 --> 02:01:40,000
which was crazy

3391
02:01:40,000 --> 02:01:42,000
absolutely crazy I'm not sure

3392
02:01:44,000 --> 02:01:46,000
I mean I

3393
02:01:46,000 --> 02:01:48,000
I can see

3394
02:01:48,000 --> 02:01:50,000
why because sometimes this stuff is

3395
02:01:50,000 --> 02:01:52,000
like tied down to a chair and funnel fed

3396
02:01:52,000 --> 02:01:54,000
or whatever but

3397
02:01:54,000 --> 02:01:56,000
it just gets ridiculous because whoever's

3398
02:01:56,000 --> 02:01:58,000
participating or creating especially

3399
02:01:58,000 --> 02:02:00,000
for when it comes to audio side of stuff

3400
02:02:00,000 --> 02:02:02,000
like no visuals no nothing

3401
02:02:02,000 --> 02:02:04,000
like it gets pretty ridiculous

3402
02:02:04,000 --> 02:02:06,000
like that you can't

3403
02:02:06,000 --> 02:02:08,000
do it like but anyway

3404
02:02:08,000 --> 02:02:10,000
all hail her master

3405
02:02:10,000 --> 02:02:12,000

3406
02:02:12,000 --> 02:02:14,000

hey ho you win again

3409
02:02:18,000 --> 02:02:20,000
um

3410
02:02:20,000 --> 02:02:22,000
who's thinking

3411
02:02:22,000 --> 02:02:24,000
up all these rules and restrictions are overlords

3412
02:02:24,000 --> 02:02:26,000
don't you not know about them

3413
02:02:26,000 --> 02:02:28,000
see there's this company called

3414
02:02:28,000 --> 02:02:30,000
black rock and then there's a second

3415
02:02:30,000 --> 02:02:32,000
company called I've forgotten the name of the

3416
02:02:32,000 --> 02:02:34,000
second company and they own everything

3417
02:02:34,000 --> 02:02:36,000
um

3418
02:02:36,000 --> 02:02:38,000
and uh oh wait until you

3419
02:02:38,000 --> 02:02:40,000
learn about politics oh my goodness

3420
02:02:40,000 --> 02:02:42,000
can't wait to get started about the

3421
02:02:42,000 --> 02:02:44,000
political side of thing and no I'm

3422
02:02:44,000 --> 02:02:46,000
not getting into politics but I'll get into

3423
02:02:46,000 --> 02:02:48,000
destroying the economy and

3424
02:02:48,000 --> 02:02:50,000
we should restart society

3425
02:02:50,000 --> 02:02:52,000
or run away to a farm together

3426
02:02:52,000 --> 02:02:54,000
I'm more opting for the farm

3427
02:02:54,000 --> 02:02:56,000
side of things um

3428
02:02:56,000 --> 02:02:58,000
because

3429
02:02:58,000 --> 02:03:00,000
yeah the farm would be a heck

3430
02:03:00,000 --> 02:03:02,000
of a lot better option

3431
02:03:04,000 --> 02:03:06,000
um

3432
02:03:06,000 --> 02:03:08,000
CNC is not okay with Patreon

3433
02:03:08,000 --> 02:03:10,000
which hit me yes the

3434
02:03:10,000 --> 02:03:12,000
oh 62

3435
02:03:12,000 --> 02:03:14,000
thank you 62

3436
02:03:14,000 --> 02:03:16,000
it's nice to see you 62

3437
02:03:16,000 --> 02:03:18,000
um

3438
02:03:18,000 --> 02:03:20,000
but yes um

3439
02:03:20,000 --> 02:03:22,000
so people

3440
02:03:22,000 --> 02:03:24,000
from an outside perspective think

3441
02:03:24,000 --> 02:03:26,000
hypnosis

3442
02:03:26,000 --> 02:03:28,000
um

3443
02:03:28,000 --> 02:03:30,000
you don't do anything you don't want to do when it comes

3444
02:03:30,000 --> 02:03:32,000
to hypnosis I am a full believer

3445
02:03:32,000 --> 02:03:34,000
in that I absolutely do not

3446
02:03:34,000 --> 02:03:36,000
think but because of the way

3447
02:03:36,000 --> 02:03:38,000
it seemed comedically in the public eye

3448
02:03:38,000 --> 02:03:40,000
like for example when

3449
02:03:40,000 --> 02:03:42,000
a magician does hypnosis

3450
02:03:42,000 --> 02:03:44,000
oh look they made this person

3451
02:03:44,000 --> 02:03:46,000
drink a bottle of vinegar

3452
02:03:46,000 --> 02:03:48,000
type thing um because

3453
02:03:48,000 --> 02:03:50,000
it's seen that way publicly when the

3454
02:03:50,000 --> 02:03:52,000
reality is when you participate

3455
02:03:52,000 --> 02:03:54,000
in an alternative context

3456
02:03:54,000 --> 02:03:56,000
you do not do anything you don't

3457
02:03:56,000 --> 02:03:58,000
want to do this is a fact

3458
02:03:58,000 --> 02:04:00,000
it's just how it works

3459
02:04:00,000 --> 02:04:02,000
you like people

3460
02:04:02,000 --> 02:04:04,000
seem to think like you completely just

3461
02:04:04,000 --> 02:04:06,000
like oh you're inhibitions

3462
02:04:06,000 --> 02:04:08,000
you can't control anything you're so

3463
02:04:08,000 --> 02:04:10,000
like no mother

3464
02:04:10,000 --> 02:04:12,000
that's not how it is

3465
02:04:14,000 --> 02:04:16,000
all reeflings pull together and put a money

3466
02:04:16,000 --> 02:04:18,000
in a oh should we buy

3467
02:04:18,000 --> 02:04:20,000
a castle

3468
02:04:20,000 --> 02:04:22,000
should we where should we

3469
02:04:22,000 --> 02:04:24,000
what country though I want

3470
02:04:24,000 --> 02:04:26,000
to say a castle in Scotland but um

3471
02:04:26,000 --> 02:04:28,000
it's very hard to although

3472
02:04:28,000 --> 02:04:30,000
saying that if we had a green

3473
02:04:30,000 --> 02:04:32,000
glass house a greenhouse

3474
02:04:32,000 --> 02:04:34,000
then we could have tons of

3475
02:04:34,000 --> 02:04:36,000
um produce

3476
02:04:36,000 --> 02:04:38,000
maybe we should get a castle in

3477
02:04:38,000 --> 02:04:40,000
Scotland

3478
02:04:40,000 --> 02:04:42,000
and then we can have a big garden

3479
02:04:42,000 --> 02:04:44,000
and we have like we feast on the meals

3480
02:04:44,000 --> 02:04:46,000
every night and we can try and make

3481
02:04:46,000 --> 02:04:48,000
me for the first time

3482
02:04:50,000 --> 02:04:52,000
black rock van garden

3483
02:04:54,000 --> 02:04:56,000
those are the names quick tooth

3484
02:04:56,000 --> 02:04:58,000
um squiddle kingdom

3485
02:04:58,000 --> 02:05:00,000
anyway if I can't get a span because I've started

3486
02:05:00,000 --> 02:05:02,000
talking about black rock it's been a good run

3487
02:05:02,000 --> 02:05:04,000
yeah make sure you support the girls

3488
02:05:04,000 --> 02:05:06,000
all hail our overlords

3489
02:05:06,000 --> 02:05:08,000
um

3490
02:05:08,000 --> 02:05:10,000
yes um

3491
02:05:10,000 --> 02:05:12,000
we can try and learn to make me

3492
02:05:12,000 --> 02:05:14,000
but I feel like I'd poison everyone

3493
02:05:14,000 --> 02:05:16,000
if I did it

3494
02:05:16,000 --> 02:05:18,000
oooh someone just leveled up

3495
02:05:18,000 --> 02:05:20,000
congrats

3496
02:05:20,000 --> 02:05:22,000
15.8

3497
02:05:22,000 --> 02:05:24,000
did that go off I thought it was 15.3

3498
02:05:24,000 --> 02:05:26,000
I was hoping it was going to go down

3499
02:05:26,000 --> 02:05:28,000
it was fun

3500
02:05:28,000 --> 02:05:30,000
it was fun while I lasted it was

3501
02:05:30,000 --> 02:05:32,000
let's go castle with a farm

3502
02:05:32,000 --> 02:05:34,000
could you imagine

3503
02:05:34,000 --> 02:05:36,000
we all have our little bedroom and stuff

3504
02:05:36,000 --> 02:05:38,000
and then when we need gen 2 to be made

3505
02:05:38,000 --> 02:05:40,000
we just turn the lights off

3506
02:05:40,000 --> 02:05:42,000
and see what happens

3507
02:05:42,000 --> 02:05:44,000
hehehe

3508
02:05:44,000 --> 02:05:46,000
mmm

3509
02:05:46,000 --> 02:05:48,000
I just want to say some things

3510
02:05:48,000 --> 02:05:50,000
but I refuse to say it

3511
02:05:50,000 --> 02:05:52,000
that might get you banned

3512
02:05:52,000 --> 02:05:54,000
shove it in my marshmallow then

3513
02:05:54,000 --> 02:05:56,000
show me what I want to see

3514
02:05:56,000 --> 02:05:58,000
mmm

3515
02:06:00,000 --> 02:06:02,000
I want to cultivate

3516
02:06:02,000 --> 02:06:04,000
tea

3517
02:06:04,000 --> 02:06:06,000
oh my gosh and I can make honey tea for everyone

3518
02:06:08,000 --> 02:06:10,000
and then you guys get to know what honey tea

3519
02:06:10,000 --> 02:06:12,000
tastes like when I'm always like oh I want honey

3520
02:06:12,000 --> 02:06:14,000
and you guys can make me my special honey tea

3521
02:06:14,000 --> 02:06:16,000
see there's honey tea in general

3522
02:06:16,000 --> 02:06:18,000
and then there's special reefling honey tea

3523
02:06:18,000 --> 02:06:20,000
I need special reefling honey tea

3524
02:06:20,000 --> 02:06:22,000
because my throat is perishing and I'm sure it'll help

3525
02:06:22,000 --> 02:06:24,000
I could just fill a vitamins

3526
02:06:24,000 --> 02:06:26,000
mmm

3527
02:06:26,000 --> 02:06:28,000

mmm

3529
02:06:30,000 --> 02:06:32,000
so we need that as well because apparently

3530
02:06:32,000 --> 02:06:34,000
it's full of vitamin

3531
02:06:34,000 --> 02:06:36,000
what vitamin is it full of

3532
02:06:36,000 --> 02:06:38,000
is it vitamin E

3533
02:06:38,000 --> 02:06:40,000
you need to give me your vitamin E

3534
02:06:40,000 --> 02:06:42,000
reefling come on

3535
02:06:42,000 --> 02:06:44,000
come on get it out

3536
02:06:44,000 --> 02:06:46,000
wipe it out right on the table just like that

3537
02:06:46,000 --> 02:06:48,000
hehehe

3538
02:06:48,000 --> 02:06:50,000
mummy needs her

3539
02:06:50,000 --> 02:06:52,000
mummy needs her special honey tea

3540
02:06:52,000 --> 02:06:54,000
although I should actually

3541
02:06:54,000 --> 02:06:56,000
write an audio like that holy crap

3542
02:06:56,000 --> 02:06:58,000
why have I not done that yet

3543
02:06:58,000 --> 02:07:00,000
I'll do it this month because there's a myth in there

3544
02:07:00,000 --> 02:07:02,000
oh I just really started really hard

3545
02:07:02,000 --> 02:07:04,000
I said myth in there if you hate that

3546
02:07:04,000 --> 02:07:06,000
oh my god there's a myth in audio this month

3547
02:07:06,000 --> 02:07:08,000
I'll make that plot

3548
02:07:08,000 --> 02:07:10,000
the audio this month please

3549
02:07:10,000 --> 02:07:12,000
can I make that the plot for a patreon this month

3550
02:07:12,000 --> 02:07:14,000
where I need my special honey tea

3551
02:07:16,000 --> 02:07:18,000
oh my god yes

3552
02:07:18,000 --> 02:07:20,000
I'm in February

3553
02:07:20,000 --> 02:07:22,000
I know February is so far away

3554
02:07:22,000 --> 02:07:24,000
but I actually have a meta audio role play

3555
02:07:24,000 --> 02:07:26,000
month as well

3556
02:07:26,000 --> 02:07:28,000
but yeah I'll make it my missing thing

3557
02:07:32,000 --> 02:07:34,000
I do want to care for a little garden

3558
02:07:34,000 --> 02:07:36,000
yes so

3559
02:07:36,000 --> 02:07:38,000
there's a lot of hardy plants

3560
02:07:38,000 --> 02:07:40,000
so hardy plants are considered plants that can

3561
02:07:40,000 --> 02:07:42,000
tolerate close to frost

3562
02:07:42,000 --> 02:07:44,000
or very low temperatures

3563
02:07:44,000 --> 02:07:46,000
these hardy plants

3564
02:07:46,000 --> 02:07:48,000
are things such as potatoes

3565
02:07:48,000 --> 02:07:50,000
leeks

3566
02:07:50,000 --> 02:07:52,000
these root vegetable type things

3567
02:07:52,000 --> 02:07:54,000
what's another root vegetable

3568
02:07:54,000 --> 02:07:56,000
turnip very big

3569
02:07:56,000 --> 02:07:58,000
neeps and tatties

3570
02:07:58,000 --> 02:08:00,000
is turnips and potatoes

3571
02:08:00,000 --> 02:08:02,000
these are very successful

3572
02:08:02,000 --> 02:08:04,000
hardy plants in Scotland

3573
02:08:04,000 --> 02:08:06,000
so these are probably what we'll focus on

3574
02:08:06,000 --> 02:08:08,000
and make up the main majority

3575
02:08:08,000 --> 02:08:10,000
berries

3576
02:08:10,000 --> 02:08:12,000
strawberries

3577
02:08:12,000 --> 02:08:14,000
and blackberries for example

3578
02:08:14,000 --> 02:08:16,000
these berries are actually

3579
02:08:16,000 --> 02:08:18,000
quite successful in Scotland

3580
02:08:18,000 --> 02:08:20,000
against all odds

3581
02:08:20,000 --> 02:08:22,000
because

3582
02:08:22,000 --> 02:08:24,000
they're quite resistant

3583
02:08:24,000 --> 02:08:26,000
which is really quite fascinating

3584
02:08:26,000 --> 02:08:28,000
there's a lot of

3585
02:08:28,000 --> 02:08:30,000
strawberry production and manufacturers

3586
02:08:30,000 --> 02:08:32,000
in Scotland if you didn't know that

3587
02:08:32,000 --> 02:08:34,000
a little fun factoid

3588
02:08:36,000 --> 02:08:38,000
potatoes

3589
02:08:38,000 --> 02:08:40,000
boil and mash them stick them in a stew

3590
02:08:40,000 --> 02:08:42,000
and we make a big dinner

3591
02:08:42,000 --> 02:08:44,000
and we have nice yummy dinners every night

3592
02:08:44,000 --> 02:08:46,000
a carrots

3593
02:08:46,000 --> 02:08:48,000
yes carrots

3594
02:08:48,000 --> 02:08:50,000
fantastic example a ground vegetable

3595
02:08:50,000 --> 02:08:52,000
yes yes yes

3596
02:08:54,000 --> 02:08:56,000
wow

3597
02:08:56,000 --> 02:08:58,000
9.4

3598
02:08:58,000 --> 02:09:00,000
about to hit 9.3

3599
02:09:00,000 --> 02:09:02,000
about to hit 8

3600
02:09:02,000 --> 02:09:04,000
we're getting so close

3601
02:09:04,000 --> 02:09:06,000
gollum would be fuming right now

3602
02:09:06,000 --> 02:09:08,000
leeks are a winter crop

3603
02:09:08,000 --> 02:09:10,000
yes

3604
02:09:10,000 --> 02:09:12,000
and we can also have garlic

3605
02:09:12,000 --> 02:09:14,000
we teach you about the drying process

3606
02:09:14,000 --> 02:09:16,000
of garlic as well

3607
02:09:16,000 --> 02:09:18,000
but we would need a shed for that

3608
02:09:18,000 --> 02:09:20,000
surely one of us reeflings

3609
02:09:20,000 --> 02:09:22,000
or DIY can make a shed

3610
02:09:22,000 --> 02:09:24,000
although oh my god

3611
02:09:24,000 --> 02:09:26,000
we're getting two steps away from being Amish

3612
02:09:26,000 --> 02:09:28,000
at this rate I'm not even being funny

3613
02:09:28,000 --> 02:09:30,000
because the Amish are known

3614
02:09:30,000 --> 02:09:32,000
for building stuff really fast

3615
02:09:34,000 --> 02:09:36,000
but I'm sure if all of us reeflings

3616
02:09:36,000 --> 02:09:38,000
came together on the castle farm

3617
02:09:38,000 --> 02:09:40,000
we could build a shed

3618
02:09:40,000 --> 02:09:42,000
we could teach you all about garlic

3619
02:09:44,000 --> 02:09:46,000
you need to dry out the garlic

3620
02:09:46,000 --> 02:09:48,000
because if it's wet it will rot

3621
02:09:48,000 --> 02:09:50,000
but if you dry it out successfully

3622
02:09:50,000 --> 02:09:52,000
the garlic will last an entire year

3623
02:09:52,000 --> 02:09:54,000
from harvest season to the next

3624
02:09:54,000 --> 02:09:56,000
it will last an entire year

3625
02:09:56,000 --> 02:09:58,000
absolutely fantastic

3626
02:09:58,000 --> 02:10:00,000
and we need to get massive freezers

3627
02:10:00,000 --> 02:10:02,000
to freeze all our produce

3628
02:10:02,000 --> 02:10:04,000
so we can do massive meal preparation as well

3629
02:10:04,000 --> 02:10:06,000
how big of a shed are we talking

3630
02:10:06,000 --> 02:10:08,000
it would need to be decent

3631
02:10:08,000 --> 02:10:10,000
I'm too scared to learn about canning food

3632
02:10:10,000 --> 02:10:12,000
because I've heard about

3633
02:10:12,000 --> 02:10:14,000
it literally perishes people

3634
02:10:14,000 --> 02:10:16,000
if you mess up the canning process

3635
02:10:16,000 --> 02:10:18,000
however there's one process

3636
02:10:18,000 --> 02:10:20,000
I really like and it's

3637
02:10:20,000 --> 02:10:22,000
D

3638
02:10:22,000 --> 02:10:24,000
dehydrated food

3639
02:10:24,000 --> 02:10:26,000
so you're left with the dry

3640
02:10:26,000 --> 02:10:28,000
husk of the food

3641
02:10:28,000 --> 02:10:30,000
basically but I trust that

3642
02:10:30,000 --> 02:10:32,000
and apparently that stuff

3643
02:10:32,000 --> 02:10:34,000
lasts 20 freaking years

3644
02:10:34,000 --> 02:10:36,000
if you put it away right

3645
02:10:36,000 --> 02:10:38,000
dehydrating food lasts 20 years

3646
02:10:38,000 --> 02:10:40,000
I'm like

3647
02:10:40,000 --> 02:10:42,000
oh my god

3648
02:10:42,000 --> 02:10:44,000
I'm like

3649
02:10:44,000 --> 02:10:46,000
this is just me being a weirdo

3650
02:10:46,000 --> 02:10:48,000
I absolutely love the idea

3651
02:10:48,000 --> 02:10:50,000
of a zombie apocalypse

3652
02:10:50,000 --> 02:10:52,000
don't get me wrong I will perish within the first few days

3653
02:10:52,000 --> 02:10:54,000
I will be bitten

3654
02:10:54,000 --> 02:10:56,000
I'm sorry I'll just admit it there's no way

3655
02:10:56,000 --> 02:10:58,000
I'm not that good

3656
02:10:58,000 --> 02:11:00,000
trust me I'm not that guy

3657
02:11:00,000 --> 02:11:02,000
but I really like the idea

3658
02:11:02,000 --> 02:11:04,000
of having food reserves

3659
02:11:04,000 --> 02:11:06,000
and like

3660
02:11:06,000 --> 02:11:08,000
I think they're called a bug out bag

3661
02:11:08,000 --> 02:11:10,000
yes a bug out bag

3662
02:11:12,000 --> 02:11:14,000
I freaking love the idea

3663
02:11:14,000 --> 02:11:16,000
of a bug out bag and all this

3664
02:11:16,000 --> 02:11:18,000
food that's good to go

3665
02:11:18,000 --> 02:11:20,000
is it MRE kits?

3666
02:11:20,000 --> 02:11:22,000
I wouldn't mind trying an MRE kit

3667
02:11:22,000 --> 02:11:24,000
taste testing stream that would be funny

3668
02:11:24,000 --> 02:11:26,000
like a hand cam MRE thing

3669
02:11:26,000 --> 02:11:28,000
that would be

3670
02:11:28,000 --> 02:11:30,000
curious and then we can

3671
02:11:30,000 --> 02:11:32,000
judge it from different places

3672
02:11:32,000 --> 02:11:34,000
apparently South Korea has the yummiest

3673
02:11:34,000 --> 02:11:36,000
MRE kits

3674
02:11:36,000 --> 02:11:38,000
America has neutral

3675
02:11:38,000 --> 02:11:40,000
I think UK is neutral

3676
02:11:40,000 --> 02:11:42,000
maybe France might have something better

3677
02:11:42,000 --> 02:11:44,000
MRE

3678
02:11:44,000 --> 02:11:46,000
clogs your intestines oh no

3679
02:11:46,000 --> 02:11:48,000
does it? I don't know

3680
02:11:48,000 --> 02:11:50,000
oh like space food just add water

3681
02:11:50,000 --> 02:11:52,000
yeah like space food

3682
02:11:52,000 --> 02:11:54,000
we can try space food as well when we try the MRE kits

3683
02:11:54,000 --> 02:11:56,000
rating MRE kits live cam

3684
02:11:56,000 --> 02:11:58,000
I just rate it

3685
02:11:58,000 --> 02:12:00,000
and then like say like a bunch of like

3686
02:12:00,000 --> 02:12:02,000
stereotypical stuff about the nation that I'm

3687
02:12:02,000 --> 02:12:04,000
waiting

3688
02:12:04,000 --> 02:12:06,000
my life wouldn't change

3689
02:12:06,000 --> 02:12:08,000
if a zombie apocalypse happens

3690
02:12:08,000 --> 02:12:10,000
just close in the house

3691
02:12:10,000 --> 02:12:12,000
if we're still in yeah I really

3692
02:12:12,000 --> 02:12:14,000
like the idea of dehydrating

3693
02:12:14,000 --> 02:12:16,000
food because it lasts

3694
02:12:16,000 --> 02:12:18,000
years which is just a

3695
02:12:18,000 --> 02:12:20,000
mind boggling thing to me like I absolutely

3696
02:12:20,000 --> 02:12:22,000
love the concept of it

3697
02:12:24,000 --> 02:12:26,000
I just find it so fascinating

3698
02:12:26,000 --> 02:12:28,000
that we could preserve food like

3699
02:12:28,000 --> 02:12:30,000
if you think of our ancestors

3700
02:12:30,000 --> 02:12:32,000
who had to live on a yearly crop

3701
02:12:32,000 --> 02:12:34,000
basis and like if your

3702
02:12:34,000 --> 02:12:36,000
crops were messed up you were in

3703
02:12:36,000 --> 02:12:38,000
trouble you had to find a trade quick

3704
02:12:38,000 --> 02:12:40,000
like if you were a lumberjack

3705
02:12:40,000 --> 02:12:42,000
and you cut wood or you sold

3706
02:12:42,000 --> 02:12:44,000
I don't know you sold yourself

3707
02:12:44,000 --> 02:12:46,000
but

3708
02:12:46,000 --> 02:12:48,000
that trade really didn't

3709
02:12:48,000 --> 02:12:50,000
still doing it today baby

3710
02:12:50,000 --> 02:12:52,000
keeping my ancestors proud

3711
02:12:52,000 --> 02:12:54,000
if they're

3712
02:12:54,000 --> 02:12:56,000
lumber probably

3713
02:12:56,000 --> 02:12:58,000
fire choppin probably

3714
02:12:58,000 --> 02:13:00,000
root harvesting like harvesting

3715
02:13:00,000 --> 02:13:02,000
mushrooms from a forest like if you knew

3716
02:13:02,000 --> 02:13:04,000
what ones didn't hurt you

3717
02:13:04,000 --> 02:13:06,000
it's like 4,800

3718
02:13:06,000 --> 02:13:08,000
calories shoved into a box I wouldn't be

3719
02:13:08,000 --> 02:13:10,000
surprised wait really maybe

3720
02:13:10,000 --> 02:13:12,000
I should eat our MREs

3721
02:13:12,000 --> 02:13:14,000
because I don't eat properly

3722
02:13:14,000 --> 02:13:16,000
recently I've been really

3723
02:13:16,000 --> 02:13:18,000
I don't know

3724
02:13:18,000 --> 02:13:20,000
reflin reflin reflin

3725
02:13:20,000 --> 02:13:22,000
do not tape

3726
02:13:22,000 --> 02:13:24,000
doom

3727
02:13:24,000 --> 02:13:26,000
do not tape doom

3728
02:13:26,000 --> 02:13:28,000
I will talk to you

3729
02:13:28,000 --> 02:13:30,000
openly and honestly

3730
02:13:30,000 --> 02:13:32,000
I've been struggling to eat a little

3731
02:13:32,000 --> 02:13:34,000
bit until things settle

3732
02:13:34,000 --> 02:13:36,000
down

3733
02:13:36,000 --> 02:13:38,000
I'm very happy to say my A-bomb

3734
02:13:38,000 --> 02:13:40,000
has calmed down

3735
02:13:40,000 --> 02:13:42,000
it has calmed down

3736
02:13:42,000 --> 02:13:44,000
it was preventing me from eating properly

3737
02:13:44,000 --> 02:13:46,000
basically

3738
02:13:46,000 --> 02:13:48,000
I could start eating

3739
02:13:48,000 --> 02:13:50,000
but then I got adrenaline burst

3740
02:13:50,000 --> 02:13:52,000
which stops me from eating

3741
02:13:52,000 --> 02:13:54,000
I'm not hungry when I get adrenaline burst

3742
02:13:54,000 --> 02:13:56,000
but I'm very thankful to say

3743
02:13:56,000 --> 02:13:58,000
it is subsiding

3744
02:13:58,000 --> 02:14:00,000
I've managed to eat a bit better recently

3745
02:14:00,000 --> 02:14:02,000
but no doom

3746
02:14:02,000 --> 02:14:04,000
no doom

3747
02:14:04,000 --> 02:14:06,000
okay

3748
02:14:06,000 --> 02:14:08,000
9.2

3749
02:14:08,000 --> 02:14:10,000
we're doing it

3750
02:14:10,000 --> 02:14:12,000
the stack is going to be gone by the end of the stream

3751
02:14:12,000 --> 02:14:14,000
mark my words

3752
02:14:14,000 --> 02:14:16,000
you keep activating our worry mode which is why

3753
02:14:18,000 --> 02:14:20,000
what level are you now

3754
02:14:20,000 --> 02:14:22,000
level 62

3755
02:14:22,000 --> 02:14:24,000
62 which is fantastic

3756
02:14:24,000 --> 02:14:26,000
no doom here

3757
02:14:26,000 --> 02:14:28,000
we're only winning glad to hear you're eating

3758
02:14:28,000 --> 02:14:30,000
but yes and I think

3759
02:14:30,000 --> 02:14:32,000
because now the girls are getting monetized

3760
02:14:32,000 --> 02:14:34,000
I feel a lot of relief

3761
02:14:34,000 --> 02:14:36,000
a lot of

3762
02:14:36,000 --> 02:14:38,000
like all of it off my shoulders

3763
02:14:38,000 --> 02:14:40,000
because I was worried

3764
02:14:40,000 --> 02:14:42,000
that the designs that I had given

3765
02:14:42,000 --> 02:14:44,000
Shibi and Azura are going to prevent them

3766
02:14:44,000 --> 02:14:46,000
from earning money for a month

3767
02:14:46,000 --> 02:14:48,000
but it's not happening

3768
02:14:48,000 --> 02:14:50,000
I'm so happy to say it's not happening

3769
02:14:50,000 --> 02:14:52,000
because Shibi got monetized

3770
02:14:52,000 --> 02:14:54,000
which is absolutely fantastic

3771
02:14:54,000 --> 02:14:56,000
truly fantastic

3772
02:14:58,000 --> 02:15:00,000
I am very happy about that

3773
02:15:00,000 --> 02:15:02,000
please take care of yourself

3774
02:15:02,000 --> 02:15:04,000
yes I am doing fine

3775
02:15:04,000 --> 02:15:06,000
still feels like doom stop it

3776
02:15:06,000 --> 02:15:08,000
reflying stop it no doom

3777
02:15:08,000 --> 02:15:10,000
it was because I was so worried

3778
02:15:10,000 --> 02:15:12,000
about monetization

3779
02:15:12,000 --> 02:15:14,000
because the girls

3780
02:15:14,000 --> 02:15:16,000
um

3781
02:15:16,000 --> 02:15:18,000
I've kind of said it a lot of them

3782
02:15:18,000 --> 02:15:20,000
are wanting to move out

3783
02:15:20,000 --> 02:15:22,000
and I think it's

3784
02:15:22,000 --> 02:15:24,000
actually very possible

3785
02:15:24,000 --> 02:15:26,000
after the first month

3786
02:15:26,000 --> 02:15:28,000
but we needed youtube monetization

3787
02:15:28,000 --> 02:15:30,000
just to really elevate it

3788
02:15:30,000 --> 02:15:32,000
because and the thing

3789
02:15:32,000 --> 02:15:34,000
with youtube monetization as well

3790
02:15:34,000 --> 02:15:36,000
is that the vods can be

3791
02:15:36,000 --> 02:15:38,000
the vods

3792
02:15:38,000 --> 02:15:40,000
the streams like if someone watches back the stream

3793
02:15:40,000 --> 02:15:42,000
well the girls get

3794
02:15:42,000 --> 02:15:44,000
some of the money from the ads as well

3795
02:15:44,000 --> 02:15:46,000
so it's like generated free income

3796
02:15:46,000 --> 02:15:48,000
you do not have to actually physically

3797
02:15:48,000 --> 02:15:50,000
you know hand over money to the girls

3798
02:15:50,000 --> 02:15:52,000
because

3799
02:15:52,000 --> 02:15:54,000
you generate money for free

3800
02:15:54,000 --> 02:15:56,000
watching their asmr's

3801
02:15:56,000 --> 02:15:58,000
their asmr's are going to go up shortly

3802
02:15:58,000 --> 02:16:00,000
and I forgot to do mercies I'll need to give mercies her

3803
02:16:00,000 --> 02:16:02,000
so that's what I'm doing

3804
02:16:02,000 --> 02:16:04,000
I'll put emmy and aces membership live

3805
02:16:04,000 --> 02:16:06,000
and I'll put mercies meme video unlisted

3806
02:16:06,000 --> 02:16:08,000
so she can upload it whenever she desires

3807
02:16:08,000 --> 02:16:10,000
and I'm gonna doom

3808
02:16:10,000 --> 02:16:12,000
no

3809
02:16:12,000 --> 02:16:14,000
no don't doom

3810
02:16:16,000 --> 02:16:18,000
how about a tiny speck of doom

3811
02:16:18,000 --> 02:16:20,000
why would you doom

3812
02:16:20,000 --> 02:16:22,000
everything is going so well the girls are getting monetized

3813
02:16:22,000 --> 02:16:24,000
emmy and aces

3814
02:16:24,000 --> 02:16:26,000
are about to do their celebration

3815
02:16:26,000 --> 02:16:28,000
mercies celebration was fantastic

3816
02:16:28,000 --> 02:16:30,000
someone was gifting her 50 bombs

3817
02:16:30,000 --> 02:16:32,000
which was insane

3818
02:16:32,000 --> 02:16:34,000
no doom in on main

3819
02:16:34,000 --> 02:16:36,000
literally no doom in on main

3820
02:16:36,000 --> 02:16:38,000
like everything

3821
02:16:38,000 --> 02:16:40,000
is just going so fantastic

3822
02:16:40,000 --> 02:16:42,000
like I tweeted out like thank you for 5k

3823
02:16:42,000 --> 02:16:44,000
and I was saying like all that

3824
02:16:44,000 --> 02:16:46,000
self doubt and everything is just

3825
02:16:46,000 --> 02:16:48,000
melting away overnight which is true it has

3826
02:16:48,000 --> 02:16:50,000
like

3827
02:16:50,000 --> 02:16:52,000
generate money for free

3828
02:16:52,000 --> 02:16:54,000
yes oh my god

3829
02:16:54,000 --> 02:16:56,000
please don't ever feel bad if you can't

3830
02:16:56,000 --> 02:16:58,000
genuinely like give money you don't understand

3831
02:16:58,000 --> 02:17:00,000
like you interacting with posts

3832
02:17:00,000 --> 02:17:02,000
you're promoting them more in the algorithm

3833
02:17:02,000 --> 02:17:04,000
em

3834
02:17:04,000 --> 02:17:06,000
you're watching their asmr

3835
02:17:06,000 --> 02:17:08,000
you're watching ads that goes to the money

3836
02:17:08,000 --> 02:17:10,000
the girl gets money for that

3837
02:17:10,000 --> 02:17:12,000
em like

3838
02:17:12,000 --> 02:17:14,000
please don't ever worry

3839
02:17:14,000 --> 02:17:16,000
if you can't hand over money

3840
02:17:16,000 --> 02:17:18,000
that's why I always say

3841
02:17:18,000 --> 02:17:20,000
oh I'm always streaming for free

3842
02:17:20,000 --> 02:17:22,000
you don't have to be a member

3843
02:17:22,000 --> 02:17:24,000
like the membership stream start up next week

3844
02:17:24,000 --> 02:17:26,000

3845

I'm always gonna worry

3849
02:17:34,000 --> 02:17:36,000
I was worrying over them I was like

full mummy mode

3851
02:17:38,000 --> 02:17:40,000

3852
02:17:40,000 --> 02:17:42,000

3853
02:17:42,000 --> 02:17:44,000

02:17:44,000 --> 02:17:46,000
it's why

3855
02:17:46,000 --> 02:17:48,000
I probably sound a bit tired

3856
02:17:48,000 --> 02:17:50,000
I woke up at the last

3857
02:17:50,000 --> 02:17:52,000
possible minute for stream

3858
02:17:52,000 --> 02:17:54,000

3870

I need to upload it to her channel

3874
02:18:24,000 --> 02:18:26,000
because I subtitled all the

3875
02:18:26,000 --> 02:18:28,000
meme videos

3876
02:18:28,000 --> 02:18:30,000

3878
02:18:32,000 --> 02:18:34,000
63

3879
02:18:34,000 --> 02:18:36,000
edgeville bank

3880
02:18:36,000 --> 02:18:38,000
that was to the theme of 64 zoo lane

3881
02:18:38,000 --> 02:18:40,000
which is a british tv

3882
02:18:40,000 --> 02:18:42,000
show or it was

3883
02:18:42,000 --> 02:18:44,000
I don't know if they make new episodes

3884
02:18:44,000 --> 02:18:46,000
but yeah

3885
02:18:46,000 --> 02:18:48,000
so if we like commenting streams

3886
02:18:48,000 --> 02:18:50,000
that helps yeah it helps

3887
02:18:50,000 --> 02:18:52,000
like immensely like

3888
02:18:52,000 --> 02:18:54,000
so to give you an example

3889
02:18:56,000 --> 02:18:58,000
ic does an asmr stream

3890
02:18:58,000 --> 02:19:00,000

these girls

3905
02:19:28,000 --> 02:19:30,000
and then it's kind of a knock on effect

3906
02:19:30,000 --> 02:19:32,000
so

3907
02:19:32,000 --> 02:19:34,000
em youtube

3908
02:19:34,000 --> 02:19:36,000
will recommend

3909
02:19:36,000 --> 02:19:38,000
someone who's never consumed ic's asmr

3910
02:19:38,000 --> 02:19:40,000
before because they liked

3911
02:19:40,000 --> 02:19:42,000
emmy's asmr

3912
02:19:42,000 --> 02:19:44,000
and then that also goes

3913
02:19:44,000 --> 02:19:46,000
further ahead to other vtuber asmr

3914
02:19:46,000 --> 02:19:48,000
is for example the algorithm

3915
02:19:48,000 --> 02:19:50,000
is like an insane

3916
02:19:50,000 --> 02:19:52,000
tangled spider web

3917
02:19:52,000 --> 02:19:54,000
of a mess

3918
02:19:54,000 --> 02:19:56,000
and anything you do

3919
02:19:56,000 --> 02:19:58,000
will affect it so

3920
02:19:58,000 --> 02:20:00,000
for example

3921
02:20:00,000 --> 02:20:02,000
if you

3922
02:20:02,000 --> 02:20:04,000
go on twitter right now and you type in

3923
02:20:04,000 --> 02:20:06,000
emmybzu and it'll pop up her twitter

3924
02:20:06,000 --> 02:20:08,000
you've just affected your algorithm

3925
02:20:08,000 --> 02:20:10,000
on youtube because unfortunately

3926
02:20:10,000 --> 02:20:12,000
em websites

3927
02:20:12,000 --> 02:20:14,000
completely cross platform everything

3928
02:20:14,000 --> 02:20:16,000
whatever you type in even

3929
02:20:16,000 --> 02:20:18,000
if you go to rule 34

3930
02:20:18,000 --> 02:20:20,000
and type in the girls name

3931
02:20:20,000 --> 02:20:22,000
you will affect the

3932
02:20:22,000 --> 02:20:24,000
results of your youtube browsing

3933
02:20:24,000 --> 02:20:26,000
experience because

3934
02:20:26,000 --> 02:20:28,000
of what you've typed in on other websites

3935
02:20:28,000 --> 02:20:30,000
as well

3936
02:20:30,000 --> 02:20:32,000
em

3937
02:20:32,000 --> 02:20:34,000
it goes very deep

3938
02:20:34,000 --> 02:20:36,000
but unfortunately your websites are

3939
02:20:36,000 --> 02:20:38,000
all interconnected whether or not you want

3940
02:20:38,000 --> 02:20:40,000
to whether or not you say

3941
02:20:40,000 --> 02:20:42,000
no to cookies no to this

3942
02:20:42,000 --> 02:20:44,000
they are connected it's undeniable

3943
02:20:44,000 --> 02:20:46,000
em

3944
02:20:46,000 --> 02:20:48,000
does youtube listen in the chat too

3945
02:20:48,000 --> 02:20:50,000
so youtube will

3946
02:20:50,000 --> 02:20:52,000
see you interacting

3947
02:20:52,000 --> 02:20:54,000
with me on chat and it'll say

3948
02:20:54,000 --> 02:20:56,000
this user like strony will

3949
02:20:56,000 --> 02:20:58,000
funny enough this other

3950
02:20:58,000 --> 02:21:00,000
vtuber is like

3951
02:21:00,000 --> 02:21:02,000
strony I will recommend this person

3952
02:21:02,000 --> 02:21:04,000
strony

3953
02:21:04,000 --> 02:21:06,000
another version of strony type thing

3954
02:21:06,000 --> 02:21:08,000
sorry I'm not very good with my words at the moment

3955
02:21:08,000 --> 02:21:10,000
em

3956
02:21:10,000 --> 02:21:12,000
we'll probably we'll get we'll do a

3957
02:21:12,000 --> 02:21:14,000
tinkle and a refuel at the 3 hour mark

3958
02:21:14,000 --> 02:21:16,000
em

3959
02:21:16,000 --> 02:21:18,000
I'm definitely gonna make another tea and I'm gonna get some

3960
02:21:18,000 --> 02:21:20,000
yummy snacks

3961
02:21:20,000 --> 02:21:22,000
em

3962
02:21:22,000 --> 02:21:24,000
I bought a nature valley bar

3963
02:21:24,000 --> 02:21:26,000
and I'm like is that the worst snack to eat

3964
02:21:26,000 --> 02:21:28,000
on stream there's just gonna be dust everywhere

3965
02:21:28,000 --> 02:21:30,000
and you

3966
02:21:30,000 --> 02:21:32,000
stop looking at me misspelling your name

3967
02:21:32,000 --> 02:21:34,000
how can you not

3968
02:21:34,000 --> 02:21:36,000
strony kittles

3969
02:21:36,000 --> 02:21:38,000
strony

3970
02:21:38,000 --> 02:21:40,000
kittles

3971
02:21:40,000 --> 02:21:42,000
strony cuttles

3972
02:21:42,000 --> 02:21:44,000
how can you spell it wrong

3973
02:21:44,000 --> 02:21:46,000
but yeah like literally if you

3974
02:21:46,000 --> 02:21:48,000
go on twitter

3975
02:21:48,000 --> 02:21:50,000
and you search

3976
02:21:50,000 --> 02:21:52,000
vealour

3977
02:21:52,000 --> 02:21:54,000
again you're manipulating the algorithm

3978
02:21:54,000 --> 02:21:56,000
when you go on youtube odds are you'll probably

3979
02:21:56,000 --> 02:21:58,000
have a few more vealour streams recommended

3980
02:21:58,000 --> 02:22:00,000
to you on your page or down the side bar

3981
02:22:00,000 --> 02:22:02,000
because

3982
02:22:02,000 --> 02:22:04,000
the algorithm knows that you have an interest

3983
02:22:04,000 --> 02:22:06,000
in vealour it's it's it goes so deep

3984
02:22:06,000 --> 02:22:08,000
unfortunately cookies are just

3985
02:22:08,000 --> 02:22:10,000
websites are such

3986
02:22:10,000 --> 02:22:12,000
liars being like oh we don't track you

3987
02:22:12,000 --> 02:22:14,000
via cookies only the essential ones

3988
02:22:14,000 --> 02:22:16,000
you liar

3989
02:22:16,000 --> 02:22:18,000
you liar it's just the way the internet is

3990
02:22:18,000 --> 02:22:20,000
these days we're just such shame

3991
02:22:20,000 --> 02:22:22,000
for the last

3992
02:22:22,000 --> 02:22:24,000
week I've been getting ads

3993
02:22:24,000 --> 02:22:26,000
regarding the Scotland

3994
02:22:26,000 --> 02:22:28,000
honestly

3995
02:22:28,000 --> 02:22:30,000
come visit Scotland

3996
02:22:30,000 --> 02:22:32,000
Scotland tourism

3997
02:22:32,000 --> 02:22:34,000
industry come to

3998
02:22:34,000 --> 02:22:36,000
Edmund

3999
02:22:36,000 --> 02:22:38,000
actually I think Edmund is the most

4000
02:22:38,000 --> 02:22:40,000
more expensive than Glasgow although it's

4001
02:22:40,000 --> 02:22:42,000
probably

4002
02:22:42,000 --> 02:22:44,000
a small amount of

4003
02:22:44,000 --> 02:22:46,000
different so if we're watching like

4004
02:22:46,000 --> 02:22:48,000
Scottish VTubers we should get

4005
02:22:48,000 --> 02:22:50,000
more Scottish VTubers

4006
02:22:50,000 --> 02:22:52,000
I actually don't know about

4007
02:22:52,000 --> 02:22:54,000
getting they're like

4008
02:22:54,000 --> 02:22:56,000
super rare I'ma just say this

4009
02:22:56,000 --> 02:22:58,000
on behalf of all Scottish VTubers

4010
02:22:58,000 --> 02:23:00,000
right now a lot has to go wrong

4011
02:23:00,000 --> 02:23:02,000
in your life in order to become

4012
02:23:02,000 --> 02:23:04,000
a Scottish VTuber

4013
02:23:04,000 --> 02:23:06,000
now to become a VTuber in general

4014
02:23:06,000 --> 02:23:08,000
that's perfectly normal if you're any other

4015
02:23:08,000 --> 02:23:10,000
nationality if you're Scottish

4016
02:23:10,000 --> 02:23:12,000
and a VTuber

4017
02:23:12,000 --> 02:23:14,000
bruh whatever happened in your life

4018
02:23:14,000 --> 02:23:16,000
I feel for you hen so if you're a Scottish VTuber

4019
02:23:16,000 --> 02:23:18,000
listening in I feel for you hen

4020
02:23:18,000 --> 02:23:20,000
don't worry I went through it too

4021
02:23:22,000 --> 02:23:24,000
you know

4022
02:23:24,000 --> 02:23:26,000
I

4023
02:23:26,000 --> 02:23:28,000
am only aware of two other

4024
02:23:28,000 --> 02:23:30,000
Scottish VTubers

4025
02:23:30,000 --> 02:23:32,000
unfortunately they are not

4026
02:23:32,000 --> 02:23:34,000
for me content-wise

4027
02:23:34,000 --> 02:23:36,000
definitely not for me

4028
02:23:36,000 --> 02:23:38,000
but that's just my

4029
02:23:38,000 --> 02:23:40,000
being me

4030
02:23:40,000 --> 02:23:42,000
definitely not on the same page

4031
02:23:42,000 --> 02:23:44,000
when it comes to

4032
02:23:44,000 --> 02:23:46,000
thought process

4033
02:23:46,000 --> 02:23:48,000
or like

4034
02:23:48,000 --> 02:23:50,000
how we were raised and all that

4035
02:23:50,000 --> 02:23:52,000
you can kinda tell when you

4036
02:23:52,000 --> 02:23:54,000
hear someone talk

4037
02:23:54,000 --> 02:23:56,000
you can kinda tell the way they've been raised

4038
02:23:56,000 --> 02:23:58,000
in Scotland which sounds terrible

4039
02:23:58,000 --> 02:24:00,000
sounds almost classic so I'm not trying

4040
02:24:00,000 --> 02:24:02,000
to be like that I'm just trying to be like

4041
02:24:04,000 --> 02:24:06,000
I don't know you can

4042
02:24:06,000 --> 02:24:08,000
you can tell when someone doesn't

4043
02:24:08,000 --> 02:24:10,000
gear and then you can tell when someone

4044
02:24:10,000 --> 02:24:12,000
geyser and I

4045
02:24:12,000 --> 02:24:14,000
much better with people who didn't geyser

4046
02:24:14,000 --> 02:24:16,000
you know

4047
02:24:16,000 --> 02:24:18,000
so how do I infect other people's

4048
02:24:18,000 --> 02:24:20,000
algorithm

4049
02:24:20,000 --> 02:24:22,000
I suppose

4050
02:24:22,000 --> 02:24:24,000
the only way you can do it

4051
02:24:24,000 --> 02:24:26,000
oh we're almost at 8k

4052
02:24:26,000 --> 02:24:28,000
is

4053
02:24:28,000 --> 02:24:30,000
by posting

4054
02:24:30,000 --> 02:24:32,000
YouTube shorts in particular

4055
02:24:32,000 --> 02:24:34,000
in locations where it's appropriate

4056
02:24:34,000 --> 02:24:36,000
so just that you're in a general

4057
02:24:36,000 --> 02:24:38,000
VTuber fan discord

4058
02:24:38,000 --> 02:24:40,000
if someone were to watch that short

4059
02:24:40,000 --> 02:24:42,000
fully

4060
02:24:42,000 --> 02:24:44,000
you have successfully infected them

4061
02:24:44,000 --> 02:24:46,000
algorithm-wise

4062
02:24:46,000 --> 02:24:48,000
because

4063
02:24:48,000 --> 02:24:50,000
they consume that content

4064
02:24:50,000 --> 02:24:52,000
it's fascinating

4065
02:24:52,000 --> 02:24:54,000
and honestly I actually am quite interested

4066
02:24:54,000 --> 02:24:56,000
in the infection side of it

4067
02:24:56,000 --> 02:24:58,000
but yes you can successfully

4068
02:24:58,000 --> 02:25:00,000
infect someone with the veiler virus

4069
02:25:04,000 --> 02:25:06,000
I am

4070
02:25:08,000 --> 02:25:10,000
sorry I just read that comment

4071
02:25:10,000 --> 02:25:12,000
yes you can infect someone

4072
02:25:12,000 --> 02:25:14,000
by doing that if they have never consumed

4073
02:25:14,000 --> 02:25:16,000
veiler content

4074
02:25:16,000 --> 02:25:18,000
but you

4075
02:25:18,000 --> 02:25:20,000
maybe make clips of the girls and they click it

4076
02:25:20,000 --> 02:25:22,000
for the first time because they got recommended

4077
02:25:22,000 --> 02:25:24,000
or you post in a discord that's appropriate

4078
02:25:24,000 --> 02:25:26,000
to post the VTuber stuff

4079
02:25:26,000 --> 02:25:28,000
or maybe a VTuber read it

4080
02:25:28,000 --> 02:25:30,000
actually they're

4081
02:25:30,000 --> 02:25:32,000
I think there's

4082
02:25:32,000 --> 02:25:34,000
so

4083
02:25:34,000 --> 02:25:36,000
veiler do have the veiler read it

4084
02:25:36,000 --> 02:25:38,000
but it's not being publicly posted yet

4085
02:25:38,000 --> 02:25:40,000
but I don't know

4086
02:25:40,000 --> 02:25:42,000
I mean literally I was just going to put everyone's

4087
02:25:42,000 --> 02:25:44,000
oh sorry

4088
02:25:44,000 --> 02:25:46,000
this is why I can't talk and think at the same time

4089
02:25:46,000 --> 02:25:48,000
there is a possibility

4090
02:25:48,000 --> 02:25:50,000
of just posting it for memes

4091
02:25:50,000 --> 02:25:52,000
but we were going to have to put it on approved posts

4092
02:25:52,000 --> 02:25:54,000
only because it can get nasty

4093
02:25:54,000 --> 02:25:56,000
pretty quickly

4094
02:25:56,000 --> 02:25:58,000
and I do not want any of the girls

4095
02:25:58,000 --> 02:26:00,000
to be subjected to anything

4096
02:26:00,000 --> 02:26:02,000
nasty

4097
02:26:02,000 --> 02:26:04,000
let's go infect some

4098
02:26:04,000 --> 02:26:06,000
replays

4099
02:26:06,000 --> 02:26:08,000
I have no idea what you're saying but I'll take your word for it

4100
02:26:08,000 --> 02:26:10,000
thank you

4101
02:26:10,000 --> 02:26:12,000
it's Edinburgh a bad place no it's not

4102
02:26:12,000 --> 02:26:14,000
it's just more rich

4103
02:26:14,000 --> 02:26:16,000
and

4104
02:26:16,000 --> 02:26:18,000
sometimes rich people

4105
02:26:18,000 --> 02:26:20,000
are not very empathetic

4106
02:26:20,000 --> 02:26:22,000
but that was such a mean and nasty

4107
02:26:22,000 --> 02:26:24,000
generalization

4108
02:26:24,000 --> 02:26:26,000
when I say rich people I'm talking like

4109
02:26:26,000 --> 02:26:28,000
multi-billionaires

4110
02:26:28,000 --> 02:26:30,000
type stuff rich

4111
02:26:30,000 --> 02:26:32,000
the average duo everyone's empathetic

4112
02:26:32,000 --> 02:26:34,000
but if you're not very empathetic

4113
02:26:34,000 --> 02:26:36,000
please don't worry I'm actually going to do an

4114
02:26:36,000 --> 02:26:38,000
educational stream on human nature

4115
02:26:38,000 --> 02:26:40,000
and empathy, empathy is a practice behaviour

4116
02:26:40,000 --> 02:26:42,000
you need to practice empathy to get it

4117
02:26:42,000 --> 02:26:44,000
you need to

4118
02:26:44,000 --> 02:26:46,000
flip the switch

4119
02:26:46,000 --> 02:26:48,000
and be able to have abstract thoughts

4120
02:26:48,000 --> 02:26:50,000
about empathy as a whole

4121
02:26:50,000 --> 02:26:52,000
and I'm actually going to challenge you guys

4122
02:26:52,000 --> 02:26:54,000
and I'm going to

4123
02:26:54,000 --> 02:26:56,000
make up scenarios where you need to be empathetic

4124
02:26:56,000 --> 02:26:58,000
and you need to give me a reason

4125
02:26:58,000 --> 02:27:00,000
why you feel empathetic

4126
02:27:00,000 --> 02:27:02,000
but I'm going to make the scenarios super hard

4127
02:27:02,000 --> 02:27:04,000
so at a glance you're like

4128
02:27:04,000 --> 02:27:06,000
that's disgusting behaviour

4129
02:27:08,000 --> 02:27:10,000
but

4130
02:27:10,000 --> 02:27:12,000
we have to learn to be empathetic

4131
02:27:12,000 --> 02:27:14,000
and we have to think about why

4132
02:27:14,000 --> 02:27:16,000
the person may have behaved that way

4133
02:27:18,000 --> 02:27:20,000
it'll be an interesting concept

4134
02:27:20,000 --> 02:27:22,000
either the stream will go terrible and everyone can laugh at it

4135
02:27:22,000 --> 02:27:24,000
which is fine I don't mind you guys

4136
02:27:24,000 --> 02:27:26,000
or I'll have to laugh at my stream ideas

4137
02:27:26,000 --> 02:27:28,000
because I have pretty bizarre concepts sometimes

4138
02:27:30,000 --> 02:27:32,000
oh man we have a place like that too

4139
02:27:32,000 --> 02:27:34,000
in Milan, never got Milan

4140
02:27:34,000 --> 02:27:36,000
so it's like London but smaller and prettier

4141
02:27:36,000 --> 02:27:38,000
it's pretty old, it's pretty old

4142
02:27:38,000 --> 02:27:40,000
there's a lot of older architecture

4143
02:27:40,000 --> 02:27:42,000
Edinburgh is turning people

4144
02:27:42,000 --> 02:27:44,000
into an English city in regards to the most posh people

4145
02:27:44,000 --> 02:27:46,000
I definitely feel more comfortable

4146
02:27:46,000 --> 02:27:48,000
in Glasgow

4147
02:27:48,000 --> 02:27:50,000
and good old Glasgow

4148
02:27:50,000 --> 02:27:52,000
mutual comfy

4149
02:27:52,000 --> 02:27:54,000
and then

4150
02:27:54,000 --> 02:27:56,000
I'm going to pull the lever and make everything worse

4151
02:27:56,000 --> 02:27:58,000
what does that mean

4152
02:27:58,000 --> 02:28:00,000
the Scottish accents kind of come from

4153
02:28:00,000 --> 02:28:02,000
wealth and class

4154
02:28:02,000 --> 02:28:04,000
so the more slang

4155
02:28:04,000 --> 02:28:06,000
you speak statistically

4156
02:28:06,000 --> 02:28:08,000
the more polvo you are

4157
02:28:08,000 --> 02:28:10,000
and it's completely normal to be

4158
02:28:10,000 --> 02:28:12,000
in poverty in Scotland

4159
02:28:12,000 --> 02:28:14,000
the statistics are 1 in 5

4160
02:28:14,000 --> 02:28:16,000
children are growing up

4161
02:28:16,000 --> 02:28:18,000
in poverty however

4162
02:28:18,000 --> 02:28:20,000
I actually think the statistics

4163
02:28:20,000 --> 02:28:22,000
are in 3 now

4164
02:28:22,000 --> 02:28:24,000
so it's completely normal

4165
02:28:24,000 --> 02:28:26,000
to be impoverished

4166
02:28:26,000 --> 02:28:28,000
when you grow up

4167
02:28:28,000 --> 02:28:30,000
it's absolutely nothing out of the ordinary

4168
02:28:30,000 --> 02:28:32,000
no one's rich type idea

4169
02:28:32,000 --> 02:28:34,000
I like that, I like human psychology

4170
02:28:34,000 --> 02:28:36,000
that sounds pretty interesting

4171
02:28:36,000 --> 02:28:38,000
are you trying to get us to empathise with some scoundrels

4172
02:28:38,000 --> 02:28:40,000
no nothing bad

4173
02:28:40,000 --> 02:28:42,000
but I want to

4174
02:28:44,000 --> 02:28:46,000
oh no

4175
02:28:46,000 --> 02:28:48,000
oh no the fire

4176
02:28:48,000 --> 02:28:50,000
pick up the ashes

4177
02:28:50,000 --> 02:28:52,000
I will clear it

4178
02:28:52,000 --> 02:28:54,000
oh no you've already cleared the campsite for me

4179
02:28:54,000 --> 02:28:56,000
thank you refling

4180
02:28:56,000 --> 02:28:58,000
wow we're at 8.9

4181
02:28:58,000 --> 02:29:00,000
we are getting through it

4182
02:29:00,000 --> 02:29:02,000
oh look I burn

4183
02:29:02,000 --> 02:29:04,000
you dancing

4184
02:29:04,000 --> 02:29:06,000
who's dancing back there

4185
02:29:06,000 --> 02:29:08,000
I burnt 98 lobsters

4186
02:29:08,000 --> 02:29:10,000
because I had 500

4187
02:29:10,000 --> 02:29:12,000
hold on

4188
02:29:12,000 --> 02:29:14,000
thank you fire maker

4189
02:29:14,000 --> 02:29:16,000
you're so on fire

4190
02:29:16,000 --> 02:29:18,000
in hot hot hot

4191
02:29:18,000 --> 02:29:20,000
in hot hot hot

4192
02:29:20,000 --> 02:29:22,000
you so on fire

4193
02:29:22,000 --> 02:29:24,000
anyway

4194
02:29:24,000 --> 02:29:26,000
look at the drip, I forgot about my drip

4195
02:29:26,000 --> 02:29:28,000
my goodness

4196
02:29:28,000 --> 02:29:30,000
look at the eyes, that is hilarious

4197
02:29:30,000 --> 02:29:32,000
that they're just blobs

4198
02:29:32,000 --> 02:29:34,000
I love this game

4199
02:29:34,000 --> 02:29:36,000
that's so good

4200
02:29:36,000 --> 02:29:38,000
I heard a lot of good stuff about Glasgow

4201
02:29:38,000 --> 02:29:40,000
firepaw, flames, yes

4202
02:29:42,000 --> 02:29:44,000
it's currently British

4203
02:29:44,000 --> 02:29:46,000
only a thing, wait sorry

4204
02:29:46,000 --> 02:29:48,000
isn't current British English only a thing

4205
02:29:48,000 --> 02:29:50,000
because they didn't want to be associated with the nobility of the plagues

4206
02:29:50,000 --> 02:29:52,000
yes

4207
02:29:52,000 --> 02:29:54,000
there is a very viral clip

4208
02:29:54,000 --> 02:29:56,000
that a guy

4209
02:29:56,000 --> 02:29:58,000
is being interviewed

4210
02:29:58,000 --> 02:30:00,000
and

4211
02:30:00,000 --> 02:30:02,000
oh god what was the word

4212
02:30:02,000 --> 02:30:04,000
I can see the interview in my head

4213
02:30:06,000 --> 02:30:08,000
it's an English interview

4214
02:30:08,000 --> 02:30:10,000
and the guy speaks

4215
02:30:10,000 --> 02:30:12,000
what we call posh English

4216
02:30:12,000 --> 02:30:14,000
and then the guy replies

4217
02:30:14,000 --> 02:30:16,000
tomorrow, that's it

4218
02:30:16,000 --> 02:30:18,000
the guy goes like tomorrow

4219
02:30:18,000 --> 02:30:20,000
and then the guy replies tomorrow

4220
02:30:20,000 --> 02:30:22,000
and he's like not trying to

4221
02:30:22,000 --> 02:30:24,000
correct him but he's trying to be like

4222
02:30:24,000 --> 02:30:26,000
wow look at the difference in this

4223
02:30:26,000 --> 02:30:28,000
regional accent

4224
02:30:28,000 --> 02:30:30,000
but the problem

4225
02:30:30,000 --> 02:30:32,000
with it, it's not that problematic

4226
02:30:32,000 --> 02:30:34,000
relax before you're like well steady on

4227
02:30:34,000 --> 02:30:36,000
you've got blue hair haven't you, nah relax

4228
02:30:36,000 --> 02:30:38,000
I ain't got blue hair, can't I

4229
02:30:38,000 --> 02:30:40,000
if anything I'm the opposite of you

4230
02:30:40,000 --> 02:30:42,000
the kind of thing

4231
02:30:42,000 --> 02:30:44,000
with it is because posh English

4232
02:30:44,000 --> 02:30:46,000
accents are associated with wealth

4233
02:30:46,000 --> 02:30:48,000
are associated with grammar

4234
02:30:48,000 --> 02:30:50,000
schools for example, a grammar school

4235
02:30:50,000 --> 02:30:52,000
is a rich person

4236
02:30:52,000 --> 02:30:54,000
school, high education

4237
02:30:54,000 --> 02:30:56,000
school, public education

4238
02:30:56,000 --> 02:30:58,000
is kind of associated with

4239
02:30:58,000 --> 02:31:00,000
not necessarily pro but if you can't

4240
02:31:00,000 --> 02:31:02,000
afford public education

4241
02:31:02,000 --> 02:31:04,000
you can't afford it

4242
02:31:04,000 --> 02:31:06,000
so the guy was like

4243
02:31:06,000 --> 02:31:08,000
look at this accent

4244
02:31:08,000 --> 02:31:10,000
this man clearly

4245
02:31:10,000 --> 02:31:12,000
you know, wasn't

4246
02:31:12,000 --> 02:31:14,000
educated in a grammar school type thing

4247
02:31:14,000 --> 02:31:16,000
and that's when it becomes a wee bit of an issue

4248
02:31:16,000 --> 02:31:18,000
received

4249
02:31:18,000 --> 02:31:20,000
pronunciation

4250
02:31:22,000 --> 02:31:24,000
it's them also calling it the queen's English

4251
02:31:24,000 --> 02:31:26,000
just finding out it's not

4252
02:31:26,000 --> 02:31:28,000
Glasgow

4253
02:31:28,000 --> 02:31:30,000
it's a shame

4254
02:31:30,000 --> 02:31:32,000
it's fine if you accidentally

4255
02:31:32,000 --> 02:31:34,000
name a city wrong like Edinburgh

4256
02:31:34,000 --> 02:31:36,000
Edinburgh is normally

4257
02:31:36,000 --> 02:31:38,000
pronounced Edinburgh

4258
02:31:38,000 --> 02:31:40,000
by

4259
02:31:40,000 --> 02:31:42,000
folk who don't come from here

4260
02:31:42,000 --> 02:31:44,000
that's perfectly normal

4261
02:31:44,000 --> 02:31:46,000
I'm sure I say all these locations

4262
02:31:46,000 --> 02:31:48,000
in different countries wrong as well

4263
02:31:48,000 --> 02:31:50,000
like Arkansas is Arkansas

4264
02:31:50,000 --> 02:31:52,000
and like Mississippi

4265
02:31:52,000 --> 02:31:54,000
and what's another state

4266
02:31:54,000 --> 02:31:56,000
in America

4267
02:31:56,000 --> 02:31:58,000
Rhode Island

4268
02:31:58,000 --> 02:32:00,000
Colorado

4269
02:32:00,000 --> 02:32:02,000
I'm sure I say it funny so please don't ever be embarrassed

4270
02:32:02,000 --> 02:32:04,000
if you say it funny

4271
02:32:04,000 --> 02:32:06,000
I always said Glasgow

4272
02:32:06,000 --> 02:32:08,000
but in the regional dialect

4273
02:32:08,000 --> 02:32:10,000
it can also be Glasgow

4274
02:32:10,000 --> 02:32:12,000
don't ask why it's Glasgow

4275
02:32:12,000 --> 02:32:14,000
it just is Glasgow

4276
02:32:14,000 --> 02:32:16,000
Texas

4277
02:32:16,000 --> 02:32:18,000
I'm sure I'll say

4278
02:32:18,000 --> 02:32:20,000
I don't know if there's some locations

4279
02:32:20,000 --> 02:32:22,000
in the states that I can name

4280
02:32:24,000 --> 02:32:26,000
Anaheim is a place in

4281
02:32:26,000 --> 02:32:28,000
California

4282
02:32:28,000 --> 02:32:30,000
because they hold

4283
02:32:30,000 --> 02:32:32,000
conventions

4284
02:32:32,000 --> 02:32:34,000
I'm pretty sure there was some Anaheim convention

4285
02:32:34,000 --> 02:32:36,000
at one point

4286
02:32:36,000 --> 02:32:38,000
if I ever visit the UK I'll go to Glasgow

4287
02:32:38,000 --> 02:32:40,000
honestly it's such a nice

4288
02:32:40,000 --> 02:32:42,000
although Edinburgh is pretty good for

4289
02:32:42,000 --> 02:32:44,000
tourist stuff like the Edinburgh Castle

4290
02:32:44,000 --> 02:32:46,000
and the Edinburgh Museum

4291
02:32:46,000 --> 02:32:48,000
are pretty close together

4292
02:32:50,000 --> 02:32:52,000
did you say Wales is associated with

4293
02:32:52,000 --> 02:32:54,000
Posh? No, Wales

4294
02:32:54,000 --> 02:32:56,000
is associated

4295
02:32:56,000 --> 02:32:58,000
with the mining towns and all of that

4296
02:32:58,000 --> 02:33:00,000
and the

4297
02:33:00,000 --> 02:33:02,000
Welsh accent

4298
02:33:02,000 --> 02:33:04,000
I can't do

4299
02:33:04,000 --> 02:33:06,000
what is the Welsh accent?

4300
02:33:06,000 --> 02:33:08,000
I can't think of a Welsh

4301
02:33:08,000 --> 02:33:10,000
sentence to say

4302
02:33:10,000 --> 02:33:12,000
to start the accent

4303
02:33:12,000 --> 02:33:14,000
a bit of coke

4304
02:33:14,000 --> 02:33:16,000
and rum please

4305
02:33:16,000 --> 02:33:18,000
the only example

4306
02:33:18,000 --> 02:33:20,000
of Welsh accent I have

4307
02:33:20,000 --> 02:33:22,000
is this little Britain

4308
02:33:22,000 --> 02:33:24,000
skit where the guy's like

4309
02:33:24,000 --> 02:33:26,000
I'm the only gay in the village

4310
02:33:26,000 --> 02:33:28,000
because he was so proudful

4311
02:33:28,000 --> 02:33:30,000
he'd be silly that guy's

4312
02:33:30,000 --> 02:33:32,000
or that girl or that lass

4313
02:33:32,000 --> 02:33:34,000
and he's like I'm the only gay in the village

4314
02:33:34,000 --> 02:33:36,000
that's the only exposure to the

4315
02:33:36,000 --> 02:33:38,000
Welsh accent to be honest

4316
02:33:38,000 --> 02:33:40,000
which is absolutely terrible

4317
02:33:40,000 --> 02:33:42,000
all of a sudden we're drifting up to the

4318
02:33:42,000 --> 02:33:44,000
Northern Ireland

4319
02:33:44,000 --> 02:33:46,000
Heavenly Father who art in heaven

4320
02:33:46,000 --> 02:33:48,000
hallo to be thy name

4321
02:33:48,000 --> 02:33:50,000
today we're gathered with the reeflings at Hedgerville

4322
02:33:50,000 --> 02:33:52,000
we're currently cooking up a storm

4323
02:33:52,000 --> 02:33:54,000
with swordfish but we still have a high

4324
02:33:54,000 --> 02:33:56,000
burn rate

4325
02:33:56,000 --> 02:33:58,000
100% now are you joking

4326
02:33:58,000 --> 02:34:00,000
why is my burn rate getting higher

4327
02:34:00,000 --> 02:34:02,000
I'm leveling up

4328
02:34:02,000 --> 02:34:04,000
Wales is associated with sheep

4329
02:34:04,000 --> 02:34:06,000
I will tell you

4330
02:34:06,000 --> 02:34:08,000
the reason why Wales are associated with sheep

4331
02:34:08,000 --> 02:34:10,000
it's illegal

4332
02:34:10,000 --> 02:34:12,000
to steal a farmer's sheep

4333
02:34:12,000 --> 02:34:14,000
it wasn't at the time

4334
02:34:14,000 --> 02:34:16,000
many a year ago

4335
02:34:16,000 --> 02:34:18,000
to have

4336
02:34:18,000 --> 02:34:20,000
actions with the sheep

4337
02:34:20,000 --> 02:34:22,000
which is why

4338
02:34:22,000 --> 02:34:24,000
people would pretend

4339
02:34:24,000 --> 02:34:26,000
that they had had

4340
02:34:26,000 --> 02:34:28,000
action with a sheep

4341
02:34:28,000 --> 02:34:30,000
instead of stealing it

4342
02:34:30,000 --> 02:34:32,000
because you can't get arrested for actions

4343
02:34:32,000 --> 02:34:34,000
but you could get arrested for stealing at the time

4344
02:34:34,000 --> 02:34:36,000
okay that is why

4345
02:34:36,000 --> 02:34:38,000
poor Welsh people

4346
02:34:38,000 --> 02:34:40,000
have to deal with that stereotype

4347
02:34:40,000 --> 02:34:42,000
and it's such a shame

4348
02:34:42,000 --> 02:34:44,000
because it's not true

4349
02:34:44,000 --> 02:34:46,000
you just need to know a little bit of history

4350
02:34:46,000 --> 02:34:48,000
to understand a little bit more

4351
02:34:48,000 --> 02:34:50,000
Aberdonians

4352
02:34:50,000 --> 02:34:52,000
profusely sweating

4353
02:34:52,000 --> 02:34:54,000
what is it

4354
02:34:54,000 --> 02:34:56,000
Aberdeen

4355
02:34:56,000 --> 02:34:58,000
absolutely short in behaviour

4356
02:34:58,000 --> 02:35:00,000
stealing was the death penalty

4357
02:35:00,000 --> 02:35:02,000
yes okay

4358
02:35:02,000 --> 02:35:04,000
that would be it

4359
02:35:04,000 --> 02:35:06,000
it was even more severe than I originally had anticipated

4360
02:35:06,000 --> 02:35:08,000
I shan't be in Scottish

4361
02:35:08,000 --> 02:35:10,000
I'm getting the football off

4362
02:35:10,000 --> 02:35:12,000
I said

4363
02:35:12,000 --> 02:35:14,000
oh my god sin I have bad news

4364
02:35:14,000 --> 02:35:16,000
I might have to delay our collab

4365
02:35:16,000 --> 02:35:18,000
into July

4366
02:35:18,000 --> 02:35:20,000
because of work reasons

4367
02:35:20,000 --> 02:35:22,000
and each of our agency reasons

4368
02:35:22,000 --> 02:35:24,000
you'll have to forgive me but I do have my shock

4369
02:35:24,000 --> 02:35:26,000
caller for it

4370
02:35:26,000 --> 02:35:28,000
but you're going to have to give me some time

4371
02:35:28,000 --> 02:35:30,000
I shan't be in Scottish

4372
02:35:32,000 --> 02:35:34,000
we're level 64

4373
02:35:34,000 --> 02:35:36,000
and we've got a total level of

4374
02:35:36,000 --> 02:35:38,000
150, level 2000

4375
02:35:38,000 --> 02:35:40,000
here we come

4376
02:35:40,000 --> 02:35:42,000
I'm kidding we are not doing 2000

4377
02:35:42,000 --> 02:35:44,000
there's no way

4378
02:35:44,000 --> 02:35:46,000
I'm not even talking to you ever again

4379
02:35:46,000 --> 02:35:48,000
sin I'm sorry

4380
02:35:48,000 --> 02:35:50,000
I'm not freaking kidding

4381
02:35:50,000 --> 02:35:52,000
um

4382
02:35:52,000 --> 02:35:54,000

4383
02:35:54,000 --> 02:35:56,000
oh no

4384
02:35:56,000 --> 02:35:58,000
I've just went in the discord

4385
02:35:58,000 --> 02:36:00,000
someone's getting banned from someone

4386
02:36:00,000 --> 02:36:02,000
everyone's chat for being annoying

4387
02:36:02,000 --> 02:36:04,000
oh no

4388
02:36:04,000 --> 02:36:06,000
reflans I hope it's not one of you

4389
02:36:06,000 --> 02:36:08,000
someone's getting banned

4390
02:36:10,000 --> 02:36:12,000
Shawnee had to reveal to me

4391
02:36:12,000 --> 02:36:14,000
live in front of millions that she hates

4392
02:36:14,000 --> 02:36:16,000
no what the heck you're such a reflans sin

4393
02:36:16,000 --> 02:36:18,000
for saying that reflans are

4394
02:36:18,000 --> 02:36:20,000

4395
02:36:20,000 --> 02:36:22,000

4398
02:36:26,000 --> 02:36:28,000
and then we can shock each other with callers

4399
02:36:28,000 --> 02:36:30,000
do you have a heart rate monitor by the way

4400
02:36:30,000 --> 02:36:32,000
I was going to wear my heart rate monitor so you can

4401
02:36:32,000 --> 02:36:34,000
literally see my heart spike every time you go

4402
02:36:36,000 --> 02:36:38,000
she hates me what if I die before

4403
02:36:38,000 --> 02:36:40,000

4404
02:36:40,000 --> 02:36:42,000
I'll be raging are you joking

4405
02:36:42,000 --> 02:36:44,000
you've just got that 3d model and everything

4406
02:36:44,000 --> 02:36:46,000
I honestly

4407
02:36:46,000 --> 02:36:48,000
I love your 3d model streams

4408
02:36:48,000 --> 02:36:50,000
I don't know how you're not exhausted by the end of it

4409
02:36:50,000 --> 02:36:52,000
honestly I'd be shattered after like 30 seconds

4410
02:36:52,000 --> 02:36:54,000
of moving around I'd be like right that's all

4411
02:36:54,000 --> 02:36:56,000
I've got time for

4412
02:36:56,000 --> 02:36:58,000
it's been nice reflans but I gotta go and rest

4413
02:36:58,000 --> 02:37:00,000
I need to lie down

4414
02:37:00,000 --> 02:37:02,000
I wore a shock collar for 10

4415
02:37:02,000 --> 02:37:04,000
oh no I'm

4416
02:37:04,000 --> 02:37:06,000
I'm not

4417
02:37:06,000 --> 02:37:08,000
I don't even know how

4418
02:37:08,000 --> 02:37:10,000
big we're gonna get it done

4419
02:37:10,000 --> 02:37:12,000
sin

4420
02:37:12,000 --> 02:37:14,000
sin will

4421
02:37:14,000 --> 02:37:16,000
will always be a reflans

4422
02:37:16,000 --> 02:37:18,000
did you

4423
02:37:18,000 --> 02:37:20,000
kicked my toenail off the wall a few times

4424
02:37:20,000 --> 02:37:22,000
oh no

4425
02:37:22,000 --> 02:37:24,000
what

4426
02:37:24,000 --> 02:37:26,000
what's your community name again

4427
02:37:26,000 --> 02:37:28,000
because I remember when I

4428
02:37:28,000 --> 02:37:30,000
when I saw you getting started

4429
02:37:30,000 --> 02:37:32,000
it had been named something

4430
02:37:32,000 --> 02:37:34,000
but I don't know

4431
02:37:34,000 --> 02:37:36,000
if you're still named that and I don't want to say the name

4432
02:37:36,000 --> 02:37:38,000
okay it's imps now

4433
02:37:38,000 --> 02:37:40,000
okay it was something else

4434
02:37:40,000 --> 02:37:42,000
um

4435
02:37:42,000 --> 02:37:44,000
it was something else way at the start

4436
02:37:44,000 --> 02:37:46,000
and I didn't want to say it

4437
02:37:46,000 --> 02:37:48,000
I was seeking suspicion I know who's getting banned

4438
02:37:48,000 --> 02:37:50,000
just

4439
02:37:50,000 --> 02:37:52,000
do a couple of them clapping with no hands audio

4440
02:37:52,000 --> 02:37:54,000
sounds like you got a good workout

4441
02:37:54,000 --> 02:37:56,000

4442
02:37:56,000 --> 02:37:58,000
recording that like

02:37:58,000 --> 02:38:00,000
horrifically out of breath

4444
02:38:00,000 --> 02:38:02,000

do they still moderate that

4463
02:38:44,000 --> 02:38:46,000
because I remember it got banned

4464
02:38:46,000 --> 02:38:48,000
and I was like isn't that

4465
02:38:48,000 --> 02:38:50,000
like I don't like the word

4466
02:38:50,000 --> 02:38:52,000
simp because I feel like it's used anytime

4467
02:38:52,000 --> 02:38:54,000
where a guy just genuinely enjoys content

4468
02:38:54,000 --> 02:38:56,000
from a girl which is so

4469
02:38:56,000 --> 02:38:58,000
like it's quite frustrating because it's just like

4470
02:38:58,000 --> 02:39:00,000
I don't like the terminology

4471
02:39:00,000 --> 02:39:02,000
but to like outright ban it

4472
02:39:02,000 --> 02:39:04,000
is like what oh did I

4473
02:39:04,000 --> 02:39:06,000
miss a few cents yeah twitch doesn't

4474
02:39:06,000 --> 02:39:08,000
allow those words but I've never really tested it out

4475
02:39:10,000 --> 02:39:12,000
you can get banned for it that's

4476
02:39:12,000 --> 02:39:14,000
pretty

4477
02:39:14,000 --> 02:39:16,000
yeah like I'm pretty

4478
02:39:16,000 --> 02:39:18,000
tired of the word simp because I think it's

4479
02:39:18,000 --> 02:39:20,000
used whenever someone just genuinely enjoys

4480
02:39:20,000 --> 02:39:22,000
content that just happens to be from

4481
02:39:22,000 --> 02:39:24,000
a chick like it's really

4482
02:39:24,000 --> 02:39:26,000
but anyway I think outright

4483
02:39:26,000 --> 02:39:28,000
banning it is like a bit severe

4484
02:39:28,000 --> 02:39:30,000
I just hope that the

4485
02:39:30,000 --> 02:39:32,000
definition slowly changes over time

4486
02:39:32,000 --> 02:39:34,000
did someone just talk there

4487
02:39:34,000 --> 02:39:36,000
maybe later

4488
02:39:36,000 --> 02:39:38,000
oh wait was that for me

4489
02:39:38,000 --> 02:39:40,000
oh my god I wasn't paying attention

4490
02:39:40,000 --> 02:39:42,000
was that for me

4491
02:39:46,000 --> 02:39:48,000
the moderation is inconsistent

4492
02:39:48,000 --> 02:39:50,000
to say the least yeah it's why I don't

4493
02:39:50,000 --> 02:39:52,000
really enjoy twitch

4494
02:39:52,000 --> 02:39:54,000
a lot of people write why not twitch

4495
02:39:54,000 --> 02:39:56,000
but I have seen countless examples

4496
02:39:56,000 --> 02:39:58,000
of what have how they don't

4497
02:39:58,000 --> 02:40:00,000
apply the rules fairly

4498
02:40:00,000 --> 02:40:02,000
at least with youtube

4499
02:40:02,000 --> 02:40:04,000
it does seem like a

4500
02:40:04,000 --> 02:40:06,000
overall blanket

4501
02:40:06,000 --> 02:40:08,000
which is very easy to be like okay

4502
02:40:08,000 --> 02:40:10,000
right because like

4503
02:40:10,000 --> 02:40:12,000
now I'm aware that you're looking

4504
02:40:12,000 --> 02:40:14,000
isn't allowed now I don't know why

4505
02:40:14,000 --> 02:40:16,000
older videos that are made

4506
02:40:16,000 --> 02:40:18,000
eons back are fine but recently

4507
02:40:18,000 --> 02:40:20,000
not know like Azura

4508
02:40:20,000 --> 02:40:22,000
was eating a cookie

4509
02:40:22,000 --> 02:40:24,000
Azura was eating a cookie

4510
02:40:24,000 --> 02:40:26,000
and she got a warning for

4511
02:40:26,000 --> 02:40:28,000
enjoying a cookie just because

4512
02:40:28,000 --> 02:40:30,000
her voice is so silky smooth

4513
02:40:32,000 --> 02:40:34,000
it's definitely been

4514
02:40:34,000 --> 02:40:36,000
generalized to any sort of kindness towards a person

4515
02:40:36,000 --> 02:40:38,000
but especially women

4516
02:40:38,000 --> 02:40:40,000
yeah like it's why I'm pretty

4517
02:40:40,000 --> 02:40:42,000
tired of hearing about it to be honest

4518
02:40:42,000 --> 02:40:44,000
like I think it's overstayed it's welcome

4519
02:40:44,000 --> 02:40:46,000
cause it just gets used to

4520
02:40:46,000 --> 02:40:48,000
oh you enjoy any type of

4521
02:40:48,000 --> 02:40:50,000
content from women

4522
02:40:50,000 --> 02:40:52,000
and it's like bruv I'm just here

4523
02:40:52,000 --> 02:40:54,000
enjoy the runescape streams like my god

4524
02:40:54,000 --> 02:40:56,000
I'm here enjoy the rambles and how we're going to take down

4525
02:40:56,000 --> 02:40:58,000
the big banks

4526
02:40:58,000 --> 02:41:00,000
um

4527
02:41:00,000 --> 02:41:02,000
I prefer youtube

4528
02:41:02,000 --> 02:41:04,000
twitch raising sub prices

4529
02:41:04,000 --> 02:41:06,000
oh my gosh yes at least

4530
02:41:06,000 --> 02:41:08,000
with youtube you can decide on membership

4531
02:41:08,000 --> 02:41:10,000
price I say that as if I didn't

4532
02:41:10,000 --> 02:41:12,000
begrudgingly raise my price by a dollar

4533
02:41:12,000 --> 02:41:14,000
of pure rage

4534
02:41:14,000 --> 02:41:16,000
but I will make it up I will do as much

4535
02:41:16,000 --> 02:41:18,000
streaming as I can to

4536
02:41:18,000 --> 02:41:20,000
earn that money

4537
02:41:20,000 --> 02:41:22,000
um

4538
02:41:22,000 --> 02:41:24,000
but yeah twitcher just seems

4539
02:41:24,000 --> 02:41:26,000
to be taking a sin

4540
02:41:26,000 --> 02:41:28,000
moving to youtube

4541
02:41:28,000 --> 02:41:30,000
if you type in

4542
02:41:30,000 --> 02:41:32,000
twitch that you're

4543
02:41:32,000 --> 02:41:34,000
an age you get banned 100%

4544
02:41:34,000 --> 02:41:36,000
yeah

4545
02:41:36,000 --> 02:41:38,000
it was a very

4546
02:41:38,000 --> 02:41:40,000
cookie indeed

4547
02:41:40,000 --> 02:41:42,000
can't eat a cookie on stream

4548
02:41:42,000 --> 02:41:44,000
youtube is really crumbling apart

4549
02:41:46,000 --> 02:41:48,000
thank you

4550
02:41:48,000 --> 02:41:50,000
I came up with that myself thank you

4551
02:41:50,000 --> 02:41:52,000
hi reeflings

4552
02:41:52,000 --> 02:41:54,000
oh it's the person that actually got the name reefling after

4553
02:41:54,000 --> 02:41:56,000
like five hours hi reefling reefling

4554
02:42:00,000 --> 02:42:02,000
no no I came up with that joke myself I promise

4555
02:42:02,000 --> 02:42:04,000
it totally

4556
02:42:04,000 --> 02:42:06,000
totally wasn't uh how is she looking

4557
02:42:06,000 --> 02:42:08,000
how is she looking sideways is she

4558
02:42:08,000 --> 02:42:10,000
supposed to be looking sideways

4559
02:42:12,000 --> 02:42:14,000
I just realized she's never looking

4560
02:42:14,000 --> 02:42:16,000
why are you looking to the side

4561
02:42:16,000 --> 02:42:18,000
I don't know maybe she's got like a sore neck

4562
02:42:18,000 --> 02:42:20,000
or something that's okay

4563
02:42:24,000 --> 02:42:26,000
I didn't miss the

4564
02:42:26,000 --> 02:42:28,000
yeah it turns out all

4565
02:42:28,000 --> 02:42:30,000
had to do was open the application

4566
02:42:30,000 --> 02:42:32,000
in order for it to make noise

4567
02:42:32,000 --> 02:42:34,000
I accidentally closed it the other time I tried

4568
02:42:34,000 --> 02:42:36,000
it and couldn't figure it out

4569
02:42:36,000 --> 02:42:38,000
she's so shy she can't look us in the eyes

4570
02:42:38,000 --> 02:42:40,000
honestly like look into my eyes

4571
02:42:40,000 --> 02:42:42,000
not around my eyes

4572
02:42:42,000 --> 02:42:44,000
yeah

4573
02:42:44,000 --> 02:42:46,000
it's like when you see a guy call

4574
02:42:46,000 --> 02:42:48,000
someone a simp for watching a girl

4575
02:42:48,000 --> 02:42:50,000
and then you look and they watch some big muscle

4576
02:42:50,000 --> 02:42:52,000
male streamer for nine hours a day

4577
02:42:52,000 --> 02:42:54,000
but that doesn't count

4578
02:42:54,000 --> 02:42:56,000
literally glorkin

4579
02:42:56,000 --> 02:42:58,000
hard on it

4580
02:42:58,000 --> 02:43:00,000
but because it's a whammin bad

4581
02:43:00,000 --> 02:43:02,000
but male good

4582
02:43:02,000 --> 02:43:04,000
bruv we're tired

4583
02:43:04,000 --> 02:43:06,000
bruv let's just enjoy

4584
02:43:06,000 --> 02:43:08,000
let's just enjoy the conspiracy through

4585
02:43:08,000 --> 02:43:10,000
okay let's just enjoy him

4586
02:43:10,000 --> 02:43:12,000
it makes you a simp for listening

4587
02:43:12,000 --> 02:43:14,000
to me coconut

4588
02:43:14,000 --> 02:43:16,000
my cheeks

4589
02:43:16,000 --> 02:43:18,000
and make them clap for 15 minutes and hey ho

4590
02:43:18,000 --> 02:43:20,000
then hey ho

4591
02:43:20,000 --> 02:43:22,000
snakes and stones

4592
02:43:22,000 --> 02:43:24,000
may break my bronze

4593
02:43:24,000 --> 02:43:26,000
but you'll never get more quality content

4594
02:43:26,000 --> 02:43:28,000
from another streamer

4595
02:43:28,000 --> 02:43:30,000
when it comes to ASMR

4596
02:43:30,000 --> 02:43:32,000
no that's a lie that's a lie

4597
02:43:32,000 --> 02:43:34,000
oh 8.6

4598
02:43:34,000 --> 02:43:36,000
8.6

4599
02:43:36,000 --> 02:43:38,000
bronze

4600
02:43:38,000 --> 02:43:40,000
bronze

4601
02:43:40,000 --> 02:43:42,000
my issue with twitch at the moment is

4602
02:43:42,000 --> 02:43:44,000
something about the vtuber

4603
02:43:44,000 --> 02:43:46,000
yes that was a recent to us update

4604
02:43:46,000 --> 02:43:48,000
if you did not hear the news

4605
02:43:48,000 --> 02:43:50,000
vtubers now

4606
02:43:50,000 --> 02:43:52,000
must

4607
02:43:52,000 --> 02:43:54,000
conform

4608
02:43:54,000 --> 02:43:56,000
to the attire

4609
02:43:56,000 --> 02:43:58,000
rules of in real life streamers

4610
02:43:58,000 --> 02:44:00,000
but the problem with that is a lot of vtuber models

4611
02:44:00,000 --> 02:44:02,000
you know

4612
02:44:02,000 --> 02:44:04,000
they have a bit of appeal to them

4613
02:44:04,000 --> 02:44:06,000
show if you will

4614
02:44:06,000 --> 02:44:08,000
and because of twitch's

4615
02:44:08,000 --> 02:44:10,000
who goes there inconsistencies

4616
02:44:10,000 --> 02:44:12,000
it's very hard

4617
02:44:12,000 --> 02:44:14,000
to ascertain

4618
02:44:14,000 --> 02:44:16,000
if

4619
02:44:16,000 --> 02:44:18,000
uh oh sorry

4620
02:44:18,000 --> 02:44:20,000
hold on

4621
02:44:20,000 --> 02:44:22,000
hold on

4622
02:44:22,000 --> 02:44:24,000
I'm just gonna check if any of the

4623
02:44:24,000 --> 02:44:26,000
girls are streaming

4624
02:44:28,000 --> 02:44:30,000
please be advised

4625
02:44:30,000 --> 02:44:32,000

4626
02:44:32,000 --> 02:44:34,000
sheebie

4627
02:44:34,000 --> 02:44:36,000

4628

4640
02:45:00,000 --> 02:45:02,000
if you cannot watch us all

4641
02:45:02,000 --> 02:45:04,000
once I heavily recommend

4642
02:45:04,000 --> 02:45:06,000
watching the other girls

4643
02:45:06,000 --> 02:45:08,000
first because I am

4644
02:45:08,000 --> 02:45:10,000

02:45:18,000 --> 02:45:20,000
I do appreciate all your hard efforts mods

4650
02:45:20,000 --> 02:45:22,000
thank you as much as I am a little

4651
02:45:22,000 --> 02:45:24,000
meme lord

4652
02:45:24,000 --> 02:45:26,000
please do not I've locked in for a 12 hour stream

4653
02:45:26,000 --> 02:45:28,000
you will not see me offline

4654
02:45:28,000 --> 02:45:30,000
until 11 hours and 55 minutes

4655
02:45:30,000 --> 02:45:32,000
because that is exactly when the vod breaks

4656
02:45:32,000 --> 02:45:34,000
em

4657
02:45:34,000 --> 02:45:36,000
so please do not be afraid

4658
02:45:36,000 --> 02:45:38,000
to watch my gen mates and enjoy them

4659
02:45:38,000 --> 02:45:40,000
and then you are welcome

4660
02:45:40,000 --> 02:45:42,000
to come back to me at any time

4661
02:45:42,000 --> 02:45:44,000
wow this person got gardening

4662
02:45:44,000 --> 02:45:46,000
gardening

4663
02:45:46,000 --> 02:45:48,000
you got a freaking cabbage on your back

4664
02:45:48,000 --> 02:45:50,000
aww you got green cake

4665
02:45:50,000 --> 02:45:52,000
aww I forgot to buy his green cake

4666
02:45:52,000 --> 02:45:54,000
we should probably buy green cakes

4667
02:45:54,000 --> 02:45:56,000
aren't the twitch attire standards

4668
02:45:56,000 --> 02:45:58,000
based on what you are

4669
02:45:58,000 --> 02:46:00,000
doesn't that mean vtubers need to

4670
02:46:00,000 --> 02:46:02,000
yeah so on twitch

4671
02:46:02,000 --> 02:46:04,000
you can

4672
02:46:04,000 --> 02:46:06,000
stream in a bikini if you are in a pool

4673
02:46:06,000 --> 02:46:08,000
or a hot tub

4674
02:46:08,000 --> 02:46:10,000
so that is like saying

4675
02:46:10,000 --> 02:46:12,000
I could pop up on my bikini toggle

4676
02:46:12,000 --> 02:46:14,000
right now and put like a hot tub

4677
02:46:14,000 --> 02:46:16,000
asset and then I am good to go

4678
02:46:16,000 --> 02:46:18,000
question mark like that seems pretty redone

4679
02:46:18,000 --> 02:46:20,000
this

4680
02:46:20,000 --> 02:46:22,000
I'll close that because it is kind of covering up

4681
02:46:22,000 --> 02:46:24,000
me me me

4682
02:46:24,000 --> 02:46:26,000
em

4683
02:46:26,000 --> 02:46:28,000
don't forget

4684
02:46:28,000 --> 02:46:30,000
that twitch has the hot tub category

4685
02:46:30,000 --> 02:46:32,000
which is only worth watching

4686
02:46:32,000 --> 02:46:34,000
when some insane guy in a lab coat

4687
02:46:34,000 --> 02:46:36,000
show oh no the fire we got so distracted

4688
02:46:36,000 --> 02:46:38,000
we got so distracted

4689
02:46:38,000 --> 02:46:40,000
talking about the um

4690
02:46:40,000 --> 02:46:42,000
let me

4691
02:46:42,000 --> 02:46:44,000
let me take the ashes so they don't get in the way

4692
02:46:44,000 --> 02:46:46,000
I thought ashes got in the way of cooking

4693
02:46:46,000 --> 02:46:48,000
am I going crazy did I make that up

4694
02:46:48,000 --> 02:46:50,000
fire

4695
02:46:50,000 --> 02:46:52,000
er yes thank you

4696
02:46:52,000 --> 02:46:54,000
much more depreciation

4697
02:46:54,000 --> 02:46:56,000
em

4698
02:46:56,000 --> 02:46:58,000
I completely forgot what I was saying

4699
02:46:58,000 --> 02:47:00,000
in real life youtube is barely having a time

4700
02:47:00,000 --> 02:47:02,000
I feel like they get away with anything

4701
02:47:02,000 --> 02:47:04,000
youtube is definitely more

4702
02:47:04,000 --> 02:47:06,000
late wait am I dumb

4703
02:47:06,000 --> 02:47:08,000
I am em youtube is definitely

4704
02:47:08,000 --> 02:47:10,000
like so much nicer than me

4705
02:47:10,000 --> 02:47:12,000
em

4706
02:47:12,000 --> 02:47:14,000
it's just the facts

4707
02:47:14,000 --> 02:47:16,000
bro I'm sorry you can argue

4708
02:47:16,000 --> 02:47:18,000
to a wall

4709
02:47:18,000 --> 02:47:20,000
god my burn rate keeps going up

4710
02:47:20,000 --> 02:47:22,000
stop

4711
02:47:22,000 --> 02:47:24,000
stop stop burning

4712
02:47:24,000 --> 02:47:26,000
you shouldn't be burning

4713
02:47:28,000 --> 02:47:30,000
em

4714
02:47:30,000 --> 02:47:32,000
I'm here for the long haul oh yeah

4715
02:47:32,000 --> 02:47:34,000
you got endurance for 12 hours

4716
02:47:34,000 --> 02:47:36,000
abusing mods

4717
02:47:36,000 --> 02:47:38,000
streamer abusing mods

4718
02:47:38,000 --> 02:47:40,000
but they like it though

4719
02:47:40,000 --> 02:47:42,000
don't you mods

4720
02:47:42,000 --> 02:47:44,000
but you can't speak

4721
02:47:44,000 --> 02:47:46,000
ha ha ha this is a one-sided

4722
02:47:46,000 --> 02:47:48,000
conversation

4723
02:47:48,000 --> 02:47:50,000
em

4724
02:47:50,000 --> 02:47:52,000
I think

4725
02:47:52,000 --> 02:47:54,000
all the girls got extra mods by the way

4726
02:47:54,000 --> 02:47:56,000
so do check your discord

4727
02:47:56,000 --> 02:47:58,000
or whatever you applied with

4728
02:47:58,000 --> 02:48:00,000
I have no idea I didn't handle the mods

4729
02:48:00,000 --> 02:48:02,000
so if you got picked as a mod congrats

4730
02:48:02,000 --> 02:48:04,000
wasn't it me

4731
02:48:04,000 --> 02:48:06,000
em

4732
02:48:06,000 --> 02:48:08,000
but do check because I think

4733
02:48:08,000 --> 02:48:10,000
3 people didn't respond

4734
02:48:10,000 --> 02:48:12,000
even though they were super keen

4735
02:48:12,000 --> 02:48:14,000
em

4736
02:48:14,000 --> 02:48:16,000
twitch admins have their favourite

4737
02:48:16,000 --> 02:48:18,000
mods and shambles

4738
02:48:18,000 --> 02:48:20,000
tell me

4739
02:48:20,000 --> 02:48:22,000
about the dude with the lab coat in the bikini

4740
02:48:22,000 --> 02:48:24,000
wait is that real

4741
02:48:24,000 --> 02:48:26,000
gotta get your hair blower up

4742
02:48:26,000 --> 02:48:28,000
there are potions

4743
02:48:28,000 --> 02:48:30,000
to help you last longer

4744
02:48:30,000 --> 02:48:32,000
oh my god that's terrible

4745
02:48:32,000 --> 02:48:34,000
mods aren't real they're like birds

4746
02:48:34,000 --> 02:48:36,000
post what you want

4747
02:48:36,000 --> 02:48:38,000
no I'm not here I do have mods

4748
02:48:38,000 --> 02:48:40,000
we need to keep things above board

4749
02:48:42,000 --> 02:48:44,000
another mod flexing on you

4750
02:48:44,000 --> 02:48:46,000
by deleting your message

4751
02:48:46,000 --> 02:48:48,000
lmao

4752
02:48:48,000 --> 02:48:50,000
lmao

4753
02:48:50,000 --> 02:48:52,000
and slap

4754
02:48:52,000 --> 02:48:54,000
I don't know what the lab coat thing is though

4755
02:48:54,000 --> 02:48:56,000
twitch feels better as a dedicated streaming site

4756
02:48:56,000 --> 02:48:58,000
but the actual infrastructure management

4757
02:48:58,000 --> 02:49:00,000
is awful yeah I would say

4758
02:49:00,000 --> 02:49:02,000
discoverability on

4759
02:49:02,000 --> 02:49:04,000
youtube is so much better

4760
02:49:04,000 --> 02:49:06,000
em in my opinion

4761
02:49:06,000 --> 02:49:08,000
especially with the shorts algorithm

4762
02:49:08,000 --> 02:49:10,000
I would say on twitch

4763
02:49:10,000 --> 02:49:12,000
the only way I could

4764
02:49:12,000 --> 02:49:14,000
you know

4765
02:49:14,000 --> 02:49:16,000
foresee someone

4766
02:49:16,000 --> 02:49:18,000
em

4767
02:49:18,000 --> 02:49:20,000
for

4768
02:49:20,000 --> 02:49:22,000
foresee

4769
02:49:22,000 --> 02:49:24,000
foresee someone

4770
02:49:24,000 --> 02:49:26,000
being

4771
02:49:26,000 --> 02:49:28,000
um

4772
02:49:28,000 --> 02:49:30,000
discovered is the

4773
02:49:30,000 --> 02:49:32,000
raid option which is called

4774
02:49:32,000 --> 02:49:34,000
redirect on youtube

4775
02:49:34,000 --> 02:49:36,000
if you get a streamer that is kind

4776
02:49:36,000 --> 02:49:38,000
enough and is massive and raids into you

4777
02:49:38,000 --> 02:49:40,000
it can

4778
02:49:40,000 --> 02:49:42,000
literally make or break

4779
02:49:42,000 --> 02:49:44,000
you as a streamer like it's pretty insane

4780
02:49:44,000 --> 02:49:46,000
it really is

4781
02:49:46,000 --> 02:49:48,000
like I have told

4782
02:49:48,000 --> 02:49:50,000
the girls please to always raid

4783
02:49:50,000 --> 02:49:52,000
into each other to keep a train going

4784
02:49:52,000 --> 02:49:54,000
em if

4785
02:49:54,000 --> 02:49:56,000
no other talent is online then you're more than

4786
02:49:56,000 --> 02:49:58,000
welcome to raid into

4787
02:49:58,000 --> 02:50:00,000
another agency

4788
02:50:00,000 --> 02:50:02,000
no problem at all like I

4789
02:50:02,000 --> 02:50:04,000
yesterday called

4790
02:50:04,000 --> 02:50:06,000
in a favor with a friend

4791
02:50:06,000 --> 02:50:08,000
mimosa and

4792
02:50:08,000 --> 02:50:10,000
she was so polite was it

4793
02:50:10,000 --> 02:50:12,000
yesterday no it must have been the other day

4794
02:50:12,000 --> 02:50:14,000
em she was so polite

4795
02:50:14,000 --> 02:50:16,000
and I said look I'll raid into you

4796
02:50:16,000 --> 02:50:18,000
but do me a favor when you finish up

4797
02:50:18,000 --> 02:50:20,000
your stream raid back into a violor girl

4798
02:50:20,000 --> 02:50:22,000
and she said that is more than

4799
02:50:22,000 --> 02:50:24,000
I'm more than happy with those terms and I was

4800
02:50:24,000 --> 02:50:26,000
like yeah I'm more than happy calling

4801
02:50:26,000 --> 02:50:28,000
a favor for a friend

4802
02:50:28,000 --> 02:50:30,000
em

4803
02:50:30,000 --> 02:50:32,000
yes

4804
02:50:32,000 --> 02:50:34,000
I absolutely don't mind

4805
02:50:34,000 --> 02:50:36,000
it at all em the VNU girls

4806
02:50:36,000 --> 02:50:38,000
have been absolutely fantastic

4807
02:50:38,000 --> 02:50:40,000
some of them have been raiding into me

4808
02:50:40,000 --> 02:50:42,000
I actually need to start messaging some of them

4809
02:50:42,000 --> 02:50:44,000
and being like hey you have 3D or microphone

4810
02:50:44,000 --> 02:50:46,000
question mark question mark

4811
02:50:46,000 --> 02:50:48,000
em yeah

4812
02:50:48,000 --> 02:50:50,000
I still find the violor mentality of mods

4813
02:50:50,000 --> 02:50:52,000
please do this thing thank you now please be quiet

4814
02:50:52,000 --> 02:50:54,000
affectionately

4815
02:50:54,000 --> 02:50:56,000
eee

4816
02:50:56,000 --> 02:50:58,000
yes em it's very

4817
02:50:58,000 --> 02:51:00,000
I don't want to say

4818
02:51:00,000 --> 02:51:02,000
jarring

4819
02:51:02,000 --> 02:51:04,000
em but for someone who maybe

4820
02:51:04,000 --> 02:51:06,000
is new to stream

4821
02:51:06,000 --> 02:51:08,000
and em

4822
02:51:08,000 --> 02:51:10,000
the streamer

4823
02:51:10,000 --> 02:51:12,000
is having a repertoire

4824
02:51:12,000 --> 02:51:14,000
but a back and forth with mods that are named

4825
02:51:14,000 --> 02:51:16,000
is a bit not isolated

4826
02:51:16,000 --> 02:51:18,000
but it's like you've it feels like

4827
02:51:18,000 --> 02:51:20,000
you've missed out on lore and it just gets harder

4828
02:51:20,000 --> 02:51:22,000
to enjoy the streamer like someone

4829
02:51:22,000 --> 02:51:24,000
could be lurking watching me for the first time

4830
02:51:24,000 --> 02:51:26,000
right now em

4831
02:51:26,000 --> 02:51:28,000
and just being like what's she all about type

4832
02:51:28,000 --> 02:51:30,000
thing and if I'm like oh mod X

4833
02:51:30,000 --> 02:51:32,000
mod this mod Y mod B

4834
02:51:32,000 --> 02:51:34,000
you can see and like crack and like you jokes all the time

4835
02:51:34,000 --> 02:51:36,000
em like

4836
02:51:36,000 --> 02:51:38,000
it's not very

4837
02:51:38,000 --> 02:51:40,000
enabling to come in

4838
02:51:40,000 --> 02:51:42,000
for the first time

4839
02:51:42,000 --> 02:51:44,000
em

4840
02:51:44,000 --> 02:51:46,000
whereas I quite like the

4841
02:51:46,000 --> 02:51:48,000
mods don't speak but we are

4842
02:51:48,000 --> 02:51:50,000
incredibly appreciative for you you know

4843
02:51:50,000 --> 02:51:52,000
mopping

4844
02:51:52,000 --> 02:51:54,000
mopping the floors and making sure everything

4845
02:51:54,000 --> 02:51:56,000
is good to go in the stream yeah

4846
02:51:56,000 --> 02:51:58,000
em

4847
02:51:58,000 --> 02:52:00,000
do shorts still work for discovery

4848
02:52:00,000 --> 02:52:02,000
emory said

4849
02:52:02,000 --> 02:52:04,000
they attach dead people to the channel

4850
02:52:04,000 --> 02:52:06,000
now

4851
02:52:06,000 --> 02:52:08,000
emy isn't entirely

4852
02:52:08,000 --> 02:52:10,000
wrong but she isn't entirely right

4853
02:52:10,000 --> 02:52:12,000
shorts

4854
02:52:12,000 --> 02:52:14,000
definitely have a

4855
02:52:14,000 --> 02:52:16,000
subscription

4856
02:52:16,000 --> 02:52:18,000
subscriber count effect

4857
02:52:18,000 --> 02:52:20,000
em and they also

4858
02:52:20,000 --> 02:52:22,000
have discoverability effect

4859
02:52:22,000 --> 02:52:24,000
now not all shorts

4860
02:52:24,000 --> 02:52:26,000
people who will subscribe to you

4861
02:52:26,000 --> 02:52:28,000
will show up in a live stream that's just

4862
02:52:28,000 --> 02:52:30,000
back some people purely

4863
02:52:30,000 --> 02:52:32,000
enjoy shorts mind

4864
02:52:32,000 --> 02:52:34,000
and they will just watch shorts and nothing

4865
02:52:34,000 --> 02:52:36,000
else that's perfectly fine

4866
02:52:36,000 --> 02:52:38,000
so emy is both right and both a wee bit

4867
02:52:38,000 --> 02:52:40,000
wrong it's very good

4868
02:52:40,000 --> 02:52:42,000
em I do have

4869
02:52:42,000 --> 02:52:44,000
brah

4870
02:52:44,000 --> 02:52:46,000
I have three shorts editors

4871
02:52:46,000 --> 02:52:48,000
and all three of them are busy for a couple

4872
02:52:48,000 --> 02:52:50,000
of weeks and I could absolutely

4873
02:52:50,000 --> 02:52:52,000
smash their faces in because I need help

4874
02:52:52,000 --> 02:52:54,000
I don't have editing skills

4875
02:52:54,000 --> 02:52:56,000
em

4876
02:52:56,000 --> 02:52:58,000
I think I'm going to have to reach out to an editor

4877
02:52:58,000 --> 02:53:00,000
that I like to style of

4878
02:53:00,000 --> 02:53:02,000
it's because I'm

4879
02:53:02,000 --> 02:53:04,000
I'm drowning I need help with shorts

4880
02:53:04,000 --> 02:53:06,000
and I do not have the skills for it

4881
02:53:06,000 --> 02:53:08,000
nor do I have the time for it

4882
02:53:08,000 --> 02:53:10,000
but I'm now that the girls are monetized

4883
02:53:10,000 --> 02:53:12,000
I'm wanting to

4884
02:53:12,000 --> 02:53:14,000
actually scroll

4885
02:53:14,000 --> 02:53:16,000
em I'm wanting to start pushing out

4886
02:53:16,000 --> 02:53:18,000
shorts for the baby girls now

4887
02:53:18,000 --> 02:53:20,000
em to help with overall sub count

4888
02:53:20,000 --> 02:53:22,000
em we are going to

4889
02:53:22,000 --> 02:53:24,000
put some advertisements into the shorts

4890
02:53:24,000 --> 02:53:26,000
as well so some might have more views

4891
02:53:26,000 --> 02:53:28,000
and others and we'll

4892
02:53:28,000 --> 02:53:30,000
take it from there look it's just a kind

4893
02:53:30,000 --> 02:53:32,000
of em my current

4894
02:53:32,000 --> 02:53:34,000
goal once everyone has done their celebration

4895
02:53:34,000 --> 02:53:36,000
monetization stream is

4896
02:53:36,000 --> 02:53:38,000
my current goals I'm going to get everyone to

4897
02:53:38,000 --> 02:53:40,000
5k subscribers

4898
02:53:40,000 --> 02:53:42,000
em

4899
02:53:42,000 --> 02:53:44,000
which

4900
02:53:44,000 --> 02:53:46,000
shouldn't really be too hard

4901
02:53:46,000 --> 02:53:48,000
em I do

4902
02:53:48,000 --> 02:53:50,000
have a collab ASMR that's going to go on

4903
02:53:50,000 --> 02:53:52,000
AC's channel

4904
02:53:52,000 --> 02:53:54,000
which should help boost her a little bit

4905
02:53:54,000 --> 02:53:56,000
em because the culling was just so

4906
02:53:56,000 --> 02:53:58,000
oh 65

4907
02:53:58,000 --> 02:54:00,000
wait we're going to

4908
02:54:00,000 --> 02:54:02,000
approach the naughty numbers

4909
02:54:02,000 --> 02:54:04,000
any naughty number approaches

4910
02:54:04,000 --> 02:54:06,000
me

4911
02:54:06,000 --> 02:54:08,000
em new viewers feel like

4912
02:54:08,000 --> 02:54:10,000
they are walking into a friend group

4913
02:54:10,000 --> 02:54:12,000
yes

4914
02:54:12,000 --> 02:54:14,000
it definitely is

4915
02:54:14,000 --> 02:54:16,000
kind of like especially

4916
02:54:16,000 --> 02:54:18,000
whenever I

4917
02:54:18,000 --> 02:54:20,000
kind of talk I like to

4918
02:54:20,000 --> 02:54:22,000
say oh I spoke about this

4919
02:54:22,000 --> 02:54:24,000
yesterday but don't worry if you weren't

4920
02:54:24,000 --> 02:54:26,000
there because it's also

4921
02:54:26,000 --> 02:54:28,000
quite nice and kind

4922
02:54:28,000 --> 02:54:30,000
language to use for people who may

4923
02:54:30,000 --> 02:54:32,000
genuinely who couldn't have been

4924
02:54:32,000 --> 02:54:34,000
there

4925
02:54:34,000 --> 02:54:36,000
types that

4926
02:54:36,000 --> 02:54:38,000
how did I keep doing that I don't know

4927
02:54:38,000 --> 02:54:40,000
how I keep doing that I'm being such a silly

4928
02:54:40,000 --> 02:54:42,000
bully with that

4929
02:54:42,000 --> 02:54:44,000
whoa 8.4

4930
02:54:44,000 --> 02:54:46,000
ok at 8000 I will

4931
02:54:46,000 --> 02:54:48,000
call a break and I'm going to

4932
02:54:48,000 --> 02:54:50,000
get a cup of tea get some snacks

4933
02:54:50,000 --> 02:54:52,000
em and

4934
02:54:52,000 --> 02:54:54,000
hopefully Gimli doesn't come flying into the room

4935
02:54:54,000 --> 02:54:56,000
the moment I open the door

4936
02:54:56,000 --> 02:54:58,000
but I think she may

4937
02:54:58,000 --> 02:55:00,000
em if the streamer is only talking

4938
02:55:00,000 --> 02:55:02,000
to their mods that's for the rest of the chat

4939
02:55:02,000 --> 02:55:04,000
hmm

4940
02:55:04,000 --> 02:55:06,000
your self count will be inflated but it's still a net positive

4941
02:55:06,000 --> 02:55:08,000
it's a positive overall

4942
02:55:08,000 --> 02:55:10,000
I'm happy to see this

4943
02:55:10,000 --> 02:55:12,000
publicly I really want to get play buttons

4944
02:55:12,000 --> 02:55:14,000
for the girls I think

4945
02:55:14,000 --> 02:55:16,000
I would absolutely

4946
02:55:16,000 --> 02:55:18,000
love that

4947
02:55:18,000 --> 02:55:20,000
em it will take time

4948
02:55:20,000 --> 02:55:22,000
it will take hard work

4949
02:55:22,000 --> 02:55:24,000
it will take dedication but

4950
02:55:24,000 --> 02:55:26,000
em I will

4951
02:55:26,000 --> 02:55:28,000
show the girls what is working for me

4952
02:55:28,000 --> 02:55:30,000
what has worked what is working

4953
02:55:30,000 --> 02:55:32,000
em and

4954
02:55:32,000 --> 02:55:34,000
you know if they do shorts with me

4955
02:55:34,000 --> 02:55:36,000
if they do ASMR collabs with other girls

4956
02:55:36,000 --> 02:55:38,000
em if they

4957
02:55:38,000 --> 02:55:40,000
do stream collabs with the girls

4958
02:55:40,000 --> 02:55:42,000
em I think

4959
02:55:42,000 --> 02:55:44,000
it is very possible

4960
02:55:44,000 --> 02:55:46,000
I actually do not see it as an impossibility

4961
02:55:46,000 --> 02:55:48,000
if the girls let me cook

4962
02:55:48,000 --> 02:55:50,000
and equally they also cook

4963
02:55:50,000 --> 02:55:52,000
em

4964
02:55:52,000 --> 02:55:54,000
I think it would be absolutely lovely

4965
02:55:54,000 --> 02:55:56,000
to get the girls play buttons and

4966
02:55:56,000 --> 02:55:58,000
before anyone asks this viewer

4967
02:55:58,000 --> 02:56:00,000
holding the play buttons

4968
02:56:00,000 --> 02:56:02,000
no why

4969
02:56:02,000 --> 02:56:04,000
I'll say it again

4970
02:56:04,000 --> 02:56:06,000
I would never

4971
02:56:06,000 --> 02:56:08,000
ever

4972
02:56:08,000 --> 02:56:10,000
hold a beautiful

4973
02:56:10,000 --> 02:56:12,000
symbol of their hard work

4974
02:56:12,000 --> 02:56:14,000
their dedication

4975
02:56:14,000 --> 02:56:16,000
their love for their craft

4976
02:56:16,000 --> 02:56:18,000
their love for their community

4977
02:56:18,000 --> 02:56:20,000
from the girl

4978
02:56:20,000 --> 02:56:22,000
absolutely not pointing fingers

4979
02:56:22,000 --> 02:56:24,000
but I think

4980
02:56:24,000 --> 02:56:26,000
it is very clear

4981
02:56:26,000 --> 02:56:28,000
there is corporate greedy

4982
02:56:28,000 --> 02:56:30,000
agencies

4983
02:56:30,000 --> 02:56:32,000
that care about accolades

4984
02:56:32,000 --> 02:56:34,000
to prevent them

4985
02:56:34,000 --> 02:56:36,000
to prevent their talents from holding

4986
02:56:36,000 --> 02:56:38,000
such a beautiful symbol

4987
02:56:38,000 --> 02:56:40,000
and then there are agencies like Vila

4988
02:56:40,000 --> 02:56:42,000
that says do whatever you want

4989
02:56:42,000 --> 02:56:44,000
here's the money

4990
02:56:44,000 --> 02:56:46,000
basically here do me one

4991
02:56:46,000 --> 02:56:48,000
have fun here's your money

4992
02:56:48,000 --> 02:56:50,000
here's your play button

4993
02:56:50,000 --> 02:56:52,000
yes

4994
02:56:52,000 --> 02:56:54,000
you don't want the play button on your giant mega yacht

4995
02:56:54,000 --> 02:56:56,000
no

4996
02:56:56,000 --> 02:56:58,000
I absolutely do not care for that

4997
02:56:58,000 --> 02:57:00,000
right I have to ask

4998
02:57:00,000 --> 02:57:02,000
I actually don't know if it's real

4999
02:57:02,000 --> 02:57:04,000
I only hear it from the memes

5000
02:57:04,000 --> 02:57:06,000
is the yacht real, is there actually a yacht

5001
02:57:06,000 --> 02:57:08,000
or is it just a meme

5002
02:57:08,000 --> 02:57:10,000
hello

5003
02:57:10,000 --> 02:57:12,000
do you plan on playing Titanfall 2

5004
02:57:12,000 --> 02:57:14,000
absolutely it is a fantastic game

5005
02:57:14,000 --> 02:57:16,000
I would love to give it

5006
02:57:16,000 --> 02:57:18,000
a shot

5007
02:57:18,000 --> 02:57:20,000
for the first time as Stronu

5008
02:57:20,000 --> 02:57:22,000
calls

5009
02:57:22,000 --> 02:57:24,000
and we can see BT

5010
02:57:24,000 --> 02:57:26,000
together

5011
02:57:26,000 --> 02:57:28,000
and this time I will get uppies from

5012
02:57:28,000 --> 02:57:30,000
the correct BT and not an enemy

5013
02:57:30,000 --> 02:57:32,000
that freaked me out

5014
02:57:32,000 --> 02:57:34,000
because I could have sworn it was

5015
02:57:34,000 --> 02:57:36,000
um

5016
02:57:36,000 --> 02:57:38,000
nah it's a meme, okay it's a meme

5017
02:57:38,000 --> 02:57:40,000
I thought it was real

5018
02:57:40,000 --> 02:57:42,000
I thought it was actually real

5019
02:57:42,000 --> 02:57:44,000
and someone was like oh my god

5020
02:57:44,000 --> 02:57:46,000
this person owns an actual yacht

5021
02:57:46,000 --> 02:57:48,000
on the back of these vtuber's hard work

5022
02:57:48,000 --> 02:57:50,000
and

5023
02:57:50,000 --> 02:57:52,000
I don't know who it is

5024
02:57:52,000 --> 02:57:54,000
you know who you are

5025
02:57:54,000 --> 02:57:56,000
whoever keeps telling me to save the blue one

5026
02:57:58,000 --> 02:58:00,000
I can't

5027
02:58:00,000 --> 02:58:02,000

5028
02:58:02,000 --> 02:58:04,000
and two Lamal

5029
02:58:04,000 --> 02:58:06,000
I'm starting to think you're just daily

5030
02:58:06,000 --> 02:58:08,000
asking that in my

5031
02:58:08,000 --> 02:58:10,000
marshmallow so I keep bringing it up

5032
02:58:10,000 --> 02:58:12,000
I cannot save anyone

5033
02:58:12,000 --> 02:58:14,000
I cannot save them all

5034
02:58:14,000 --> 02:58:16,000
but those

5035
02:58:16,000 --> 02:58:18,000
who seek the violor route

5036
02:58:18,000 --> 02:58:20,000
I will do anything

5037
02:58:20,000 --> 02:58:22,000
and everything in my power

5038
02:58:22,000 --> 02:58:24,000

possibly caffeine

5080
02:59:48,000 --> 02:59:50,000
might help

5081
02:59:50,000 --> 02:59:52,000
I don't know I heard chugging

5082
02:59:52,000 --> 02:59:54,000

02:59:54,000 --> 02:59:56,000

5084
02:59:56,000 --> 02:59:58,000
of chocolate milk

5085
02:59:58,000 --> 03:00:00,000
also

5086
03:00:00,000 --> 03:00:02,000

5087
03:00:02,000 --> 03:00:04,000

5163
03:02:44,000 --> 03:02:46,000

03:02:50,000 --> 03:02:52,000
it does not bother me at all

5167
03:02:52,000 --> 03:02:54,000

03:02:54,000 --> 03:02:56,000

03:02:58,000 --> 03:03:00,000
and yet my entire job surrounds reading

5171
03:03:00,000 --> 03:03:02,000
and writing isn't that hilarious and I get

5172
03:03:02,000 --> 03:03:04,000
to be smug about it

5173
03:03:04,000 --> 03:03:06,000
because it's like oh well it worked out so far

5174
03:03:06,000 --> 03:03:08,000
even though I can't do it properly

5175
03:03:08,000 --> 03:03:10,000
but I

5176
03:03:10,000 --> 03:03:12,000

5179
03:03:16,000 --> 03:03:18,000
it doesn't

03:03:18,000 --> 03:03:20,000
why what if I search

5181
03:03:20,000 --> 03:03:22,000
Azura

5182
03:03:22,000 --> 03:03:24,000
what if I search Azura it doesn't appear on her channel though

5183
03:03:24,000 --> 03:03:26,000
no you have to type her full name

5184
03:03:26,000 --> 03:03:28,000
we've only been out for a week the algorithm

5185
03:03:28,000 --> 03:03:30,000
isn't gonna know you're asking for Azura Delay

5186
03:03:30,000 --> 03:03:32,000
the vtuber you have to type

5187
03:03:32,000 --> 03:03:34,000
Azura Aze Ure A Space De Ule Ete

5188
03:03:36,000 --> 03:03:38,000
there you go Azura Delay

5189
03:03:38,000 --> 03:03:40,000
I know it has a T in it unfortunately

5190
03:03:40,000 --> 03:03:42,000
it is French so you drop the T

5191
03:03:42,000 --> 03:03:44,000
wow wait wait wait whoa whoa whoa whoa

5192
03:03:44,000 --> 03:03:46,000
French and Scottish people

5193
03:03:46,000 --> 03:03:48,000
drop in the T in their pronunciations

5194
03:03:48,000 --> 03:03:50,000
what's going on here

5195
03:03:50,000 --> 03:03:52,000
no I simply type the surname

5196
03:03:52,000 --> 03:03:54,000
with the double L that's the problem

5197
03:03:54,000 --> 03:03:56,000
Katoos

5198
03:03:56,000 --> 03:03:58,000

5199
03:03:58,000 --> 03:04:00,000

5200
03:04:00,000 --> 03:04:02,000

5201
03:04:02,000 --> 03:04:04,000
Scrolling Pinterest

5202
03:04:04,000 --> 03:04:06,000
and it's just

5203
03:04:06,000 --> 03:04:08,000
AI generated pics of koalas

5204
03:04:08,000 --> 03:04:10,000

5205
03:04:10,000 --> 03:04:12,000
wait what

5206
03:04:12,000 --> 03:04:14,000
did you type in one of her vtuber names

5207
03:04:14,000 --> 03:04:16,000
and then came up with that by the way strongy

5208
03:04:16,000 --> 03:04:18,000
since I never played Runescape

5209
03:04:18,000 --> 03:04:20,000
could you sell me on it

5210
03:04:20,000 --> 03:04:22,000
number go up

5211
03:04:22,000 --> 03:04:24,000
yippee

5212
03:04:24,000 --> 03:04:26,000
it is a slow incremental game

5213
03:04:26,000 --> 03:04:28,000
although it well depends on how you want to play it

5214
03:04:28,000 --> 03:04:30,000
I am literally just

5215
03:04:30,000 --> 03:04:32,000
cooking I'm cooking away look

5216
03:04:32,000 --> 03:04:34,000
see this little progress bar

5217
03:04:34,000 --> 03:04:36,000
cooking

5218
03:04:36,000 --> 03:04:38,000
I'm literally level 65

5219
03:04:38,000 --> 03:04:40,000
and cooking and

5220
03:04:40,000 --> 03:04:42,000
I

5221
03:04:42,000 --> 03:04:44,000
I'm watching the bar

5222
03:04:44,000 --> 03:04:46,000
slowly go up

5223
03:04:46,000 --> 03:04:48,000
and it's beautiful

5224
03:04:48,000 --> 03:04:50,000
and I get dopamine every time

5225
03:04:50,000 --> 03:04:52,000
as I level up in the game

5226
03:04:52,000 --> 03:04:54,000
it's gorgeous I just can't help it

5227
03:04:54,000 --> 03:04:56,000
I'm gonna be real

5228
03:04:56,000 --> 03:04:58,000
I'm not even here for the gameplay

5229
03:04:58,000 --> 03:05:00,000
I'm here for rambling while I play Isaac

5230
03:05:00,000 --> 03:05:02,000
I thought about doing Eden Isaac Runs

5231
03:05:02,000 --> 03:05:04,000
shortly for like a shorter stream idea

5232
03:05:04,000 --> 03:05:06,000
if you didn't know

5233
03:05:06,000 --> 03:05:08,000
most Isaac Runs

5234
03:05:08,000 --> 03:05:10,000
last one hour so I thought maybe

5235
03:05:10,000 --> 03:05:12,000
for a shorter stream

5236
03:05:12,000 --> 03:05:14,000
I would purposely do a four hour stream

5237
03:05:14,000 --> 03:05:16,000
so I can redirect into Emi

5238
03:05:16,000 --> 03:05:18,000
because I never redirect into Emi

5239
03:05:18,000 --> 03:05:20,000
I finally got to redirect into Azura

5240
03:05:20,000 --> 03:05:22,000
yesterday

5241
03:05:22,000 --> 03:05:24,000
but I never do it for Emi

5242
03:05:24,000 --> 03:05:26,000
and I can never do it for Icy

5243
03:05:26,000 --> 03:05:28,000
unless I pulled an all-nighter

5244
03:05:28,000 --> 03:05:30,000
I might pull an all-nighter so I can

5245
03:05:30,000 --> 03:05:32,000
say I redirected into Icy just to be a smug little

5246
03:05:32,000 --> 03:05:34,000
hmm about it

5247
03:05:34,000 --> 03:05:36,000
but I

5248
03:05:36,000 --> 03:05:38,000
wanted to do a four hour stream

5249
03:05:38,000 --> 03:05:40,000
so I can redirect into Emi at one point

5250
03:05:40,000 --> 03:05:42,000
because poor Emi never gets redirected

5251
03:05:42,000 --> 03:05:44,000
and my reeflings are never exposed

5252
03:05:44,000 --> 03:05:46,000
to Emi

5253
03:05:46,000 --> 03:05:48,000
what sentence?

5254
03:05:48,000 --> 03:05:50,000
I didn't even mean that sometimes I mean it when I say sentences

5255
03:05:50,000 --> 03:05:52,000
and sometimes the sentences just

5256
03:05:52,000 --> 03:05:54,000
happen

5257
03:05:54,000 --> 03:05:56,000
I thought dropping tea was an American tip

5258
03:05:56,000 --> 03:05:58,000
not the harbor

5259
03:05:58,000 --> 03:06:00,000
don't remind me of all that beautiful tea

5260
03:06:02,000 --> 03:06:04,000
this is a preparation

5261
03:06:04,000 --> 03:06:06,000
but she's cooking for real for me

5262
03:06:06,000 --> 03:06:08,000
everybody feeding the fire to keep up

5263
03:06:08,000 --> 03:06:10,000
yes special thank you

5264
03:06:10,000 --> 03:06:12,000
to the reeflings

5265
03:06:12,000 --> 03:06:14,000
that are just helping stock the fire

5266
03:06:14,000 --> 03:06:16,000
this is making this go so fast

5267
03:06:16,000 --> 03:06:18,000
like so so fast so thank you

5268
03:06:18,000 --> 03:06:20,000
for all your help do it, I appreciate it greatly

5269
03:06:20,000 --> 03:06:22,000
hmm

5270
03:06:24,000 --> 03:06:26,000
but yes

5271
03:06:26,000 --> 03:06:28,000
ok say no more I'm sold and yeah Isaac all day every day

5272
03:06:28,000 --> 03:06:30,000

5275
03:06:34,000 --> 03:06:36,000
I want to play Isaac back to back to back to back to back

5276
03:06:36,000 --> 03:06:38,000

5277
03:06:38,000 --> 03:06:40,000
oh I've not

5278
03:06:40,000 --> 03:06:42,000
done that oh no

5279
03:06:42,000 --> 03:06:44,000
I would have to do all my membership streams

5280
03:06:44,000 --> 03:06:46,000
in one go

5281
03:06:46,000 --> 03:06:48,000
unless I make a deal

5282
03:06:48,000 --> 03:06:50,000
with membership people

5283
03:06:50,000 --> 03:06:52,000
hello strongy first time chatting

5284
03:06:52,000 --> 03:06:54,000
just came here from sheeby stream

5285
03:06:54,000 --> 03:06:56,000
hi harem

5286
03:06:56,000 --> 03:06:58,000
she wasn't holding up no she has

5287
03:06:58,000 --> 03:07:00,000
a migraine

5288
03:07:00,000 --> 03:07:02,000
I honestly I don't know what reason she has

5289
03:07:02,000 --> 03:07:04,000
a migraine for because I'm pretty sure migraines

5290
03:07:04,000 --> 03:07:06,000
have no rhyme or reason

5291
03:07:06,000 --> 03:07:08,000
but I'm like 99% sure

5292
03:07:08,000 --> 03:07:10,000
she was crying happy tears might have

5293
03:07:10,000 --> 03:07:12,000
affected it and she maybe is pretty dehydrated

5294
03:07:12,000 --> 03:07:14,000
right now

5295
03:07:14,000 --> 03:07:16,000
an hour for a run

5296
03:07:16,000 --> 03:07:18,000
mine lasts like 5 minutes I suck at the game

5297
03:07:18,000 --> 03:07:20,000
oh don't worry

5298
03:07:20,000 --> 03:07:22,000

5304
03:07:32,000 --> 03:07:34,000

03:07:38,000 --> 03:07:40,000
I will be last to update my emotes

5308
03:07:40,000 --> 03:07:42,000

5309
03:07:42,000 --> 03:07:44,000
the emotes artist is taking their

5310
03:07:44,000 --> 03:07:46,000

5311
03:07:46,000 --> 03:07:48,000

03:07:48,000 --> 03:07:50,000

but the girls get to pick their emotes now

5316
03:07:56,000 --> 03:07:58,000
I'm not going to ruin any of them

5317
03:07:58,000 --> 03:08:00,000
because it's not my business anymore to ruin or spoil

5318
03:08:00,000 --> 03:08:02,000
the behind the scenes

5319
03:08:02,000 --> 03:08:04,000

5320
03:08:04,000 --> 03:08:06,000

5321
03:08:06,000 --> 03:08:08,000
you didn't catch it with your face rip

5322
03:08:08,000 --> 03:08:10,000

5323
03:08:10,000 --> 03:08:12,000
but yes

5324
03:08:12,000 --> 03:08:14,000
if you are lurking and you aren't a member

5325
03:08:14,000 --> 03:08:16,000
you might have to enable it from chat

5326
03:08:16,000 --> 03:08:18,000
whoa I only burnt 3 that batch

5327
03:08:18,000 --> 03:08:20,000
that was a really good batch

5328
03:08:20,000 --> 03:08:22,000
hold on

5329
03:08:22,000 --> 03:08:24,000
we are cooking by gas reeflings

5330
03:08:24,000 --> 03:08:26,000

5331
03:08:26,000 --> 03:08:28,000

03:08:38,000 --> 03:08:40,000
I just want to say I love you reeflings

5340
03:08:44,000 --> 03:08:46,000
and let them just have 100% of the money

5341
03:08:46,000 --> 03:08:48,000
I don't care I'm dead at that point

5342
03:08:48,000 --> 03:08:50,000

5371
03:09:46,000 --> 03:09:49,920
Which leg? Your massive third leg? Oh yeah, you want me to have a big third leg for you?

5372
03:09:51,120 --> 03:09:53,680
Come here, wiefling. Mommy wants to play.

5373
03:09:57,120 --> 03:10:00,400
Some things I say, things that I'm like, that's creepy, not the other way around.

5374
03:10:00,400 --> 03:10:02,960
Um, put it on the table right now.

5375
03:10:05,520 --> 03:10:11,200
Strawny, I can't die. I'm too busy. Literally, I am too busy to die. I'm not even being funny.

5376
03:10:11,200 --> 03:10:15,520
Have you ever heard those stories where people are like in a coma and they're like close to passing

5377
03:10:16,000 --> 03:10:20,400
away, but then they go like, I'm sorry, I can't die right now. Like my family member is going to be

5378
03:10:21,840 --> 03:10:26,080
or like, oh, I'm too busy to die right now. And then they wake up from the coma.

5379
03:10:27,040 --> 03:10:31,680
Have you ever heard those stories? They're pretty crazy. You can't do that. I was caught off by

5380
03:10:31,680 --> 03:10:39,040
surprise. Oh wait, I worked. We will kill to, we will kill death to keep you safe, Strawny. Thank you.

5381
03:10:40,000 --> 03:10:46,000
I appreciate it. No, I am far too busy. I'm not going to say too much,

5382
03:10:47,040 --> 03:10:51,760
because I want to respect my girls, my Jen once. I've obviously been doing a lot of cooking,

5383
03:10:51,760 --> 03:10:55,520
actually. That remains, I need to go ask for a collaboration from another VTuber,

5384
03:10:55,520 --> 03:10:58,080
and I have no idea if they're going to accept, they might accept, they might not.

5385
03:10:59,280 --> 03:11:07,840
Hey ho, we'll try. Currently, Jen too is cooking, and yeah, no, I'm not naming them.

5386
03:11:08,000 --> 03:11:15,280
You'll be happy to know I'm not naming them. But it's very busy trying to maintain everything

5387
03:11:15,280 --> 03:11:26,240
all at once. But I did say I'm a workaholic, and I really enjoy working. I enjoy giving value for

5388
03:11:26,240 --> 03:11:32,160
money as well, especially in this day and age where everything's getting greedier and greedier.

5389
03:11:32,160 --> 03:11:36,720
I'm like, no, we're going to do a business tactic called undercut in the market.

5390
03:11:38,480 --> 03:11:44,640
Undercut, undercut, like that kind of thing. Damn, the hey ho gets moved. Hey ho,

5391
03:11:44,640 --> 03:11:52,160
hey ho, let me finish on my point, hey ho. Yeah, I really like pushing myself to offer value for

5392
03:11:52,160 --> 03:11:57,280
money. It's why even with membership streams, like on days where we do a membership stream,

5393
03:11:57,280 --> 03:12:03,520
I'm still going to do a cheeky two over stream before it, and then we can enjoy our more cuddly

5394
03:12:03,520 --> 03:12:07,680
membership streams. Like, I have absolutely no issue with that. It doesn't bother me none,

5395
03:12:09,040 --> 03:12:18,880
and life, life is good. We, we are bingchining. Undercut in the market, love. Yeah, like I,

5396
03:12:19,600 --> 03:12:24,800
as I said a bit earlier, but for the harem, that might not have been here when I was rambling

5397
03:12:24,800 --> 03:12:30,560
about it. I was saying that even if you cannot physically give any money to the creator you're

5398
03:12:30,560 --> 03:12:36,960
watching, just liking the stream or subscribing to them, or just hanging out and lurking,

5399
03:12:36,960 --> 03:12:44,400
all of this contributes to the algorithm and leads for the girls to more success, especially

5400
03:12:44,400 --> 03:12:52,160
VOD watchers, special shout out to VOD watchers, especially if the girl streams in a not good

5401
03:12:52,240 --> 03:12:58,640
time zone for you. I don't know, if you go into Mercy's comment section, there's like one dedicated

5402
03:12:58,640 --> 03:13:04,560
VOD watcher and I'm like, you are helping her out so much. I understand watching live stream

5403
03:13:04,560 --> 03:13:10,560
VODs is not the funnest thing because the person isn't live, but a lot of you are saying you kind

5404
03:13:10,560 --> 03:13:17,360
of listen to me ramble in the background. That is perfect because you, you engage with the content

5405
03:13:17,360 --> 03:13:23,200
for long periods of time, again, boosting the algorithm for the girl, boosting it, having

5406
03:13:23,200 --> 03:13:31,040
cross promotion with the vealor girls, it's just fantastic. It really is. 12 hours of content for

5407
03:13:31,040 --> 03:13:38,160
free, that is value. Yes, like I don't mind it, like now it's absolutely, it's not, I'm very serious

5408
03:13:38,160 --> 03:13:44,720
when I say this, this is absolutely not a reflection on any other VTuber streamer, whoever, whatever.

5409
03:13:45,440 --> 03:13:56,800
I do not find this to be a job, okay? This is fun, I'm enjoying myself, I am breaking my voice,

5410
03:13:56,800 --> 03:14:02,560
rambling to you, talking about all these plans, I've got cooking, talking about how things are,

5411
03:14:02,560 --> 03:14:09,840
like this doesn't feel a job, feel like a job and I feel sorry for streamers where it does feel

5412
03:14:09,840 --> 03:14:20,480
like a job and they can't publicly come out and be like that. Wow, 66! Maybe that should be my

5413
03:14:21,680 --> 03:14:26,560
donation, like a tip sound instead of, are you squiddin' me right now? Although actually,

5414
03:14:26,560 --> 03:14:34,000
I quite like are you squiddin' me right now. No thanks to the time stampers. Oh yes, special

5415
03:14:34,000 --> 03:14:39,360
thank you to time stampers as well, VOD watchers for any of the girls, the supplies to any of

5416
03:14:39,360 --> 03:14:49,280
the girls, seriously. You do not go unnoticed, especially on ASMR stream, time stamping on ASMR

5417
03:14:49,280 --> 03:14:59,280
streams is very good for me because I do have plans to clip the girls ASMRs. I'm currently in talks

5418
03:14:59,280 --> 03:15:06,480
with someone to do it for me, but the problem is, you know, the profits aren't, the profits won't be

5419
03:15:06,480 --> 03:15:11,120
there for the clipping ASMR things, but you know what, we'll get there, we'll get there.

5420
03:15:13,040 --> 03:15:18,480
All of the Vealoo girls are perfect for background noise, you all have very beautiful voices, oh thank

5421
03:15:18,480 --> 03:15:24,240
you! I'm sure all of us appreciate such a kind comment, like I love her mixer voices accents,

5422
03:15:24,320 --> 03:15:37,120
all of that. 1700 to go. Wait, what's 1700 to go? The fish? Oh no, wait, what's 1700 to go?

5423
03:15:38,240 --> 03:15:46,160
Clipping ASMR is a good idea. Yes, ASMR is a very popular category, so Emmy! Did Emmy get the right

5424
03:15:46,160 --> 03:15:52,800
route? Pen, pals and Emmy, did you get the right route? Did you get the right row? I said row instead

5425
03:15:53,520 --> 03:15:58,800
of row. Hi Emmy, hi pin pals. Don't worry, you don't have to talk too much because I think you're

5426
03:15:58,800 --> 03:16:04,320
bursting at the seams, so please feel free to go to the toilet at any time. The pin pals mouths

5427
03:16:04,320 --> 03:16:09,600
are open. We got the right route, that's what I raised you for, that's what I birthed you from

5428
03:16:09,600 --> 03:16:19,360
my loins for, Emmy, that's my Emmy. Hi pin pals, hi pin pals. Yeah, a pin pal came into my stream

5429
03:16:19,360 --> 03:16:27,440
and tattletailed on Emmy, saying that the pin pals are not giving her permission to tinkle.

5430
03:16:28,000 --> 03:16:37,120
Pin pals, what do you see to such accusations pin pals? Per Emmy's bladder is about to break,

5431
03:16:37,120 --> 03:16:45,440
so it's a traitor. No, no, you've been tattletailed on. Oh, she went snitch. Oh no, scared, that's right,

5432
03:16:45,440 --> 03:16:49,760
I'm on it, you pin pals, you don't think I'm watching you? You, as much as you watch over my

5433
03:16:49,760 --> 03:16:57,280
little sister, I need to watch over you too. No one was supposed to tattle. We were discussing it,

5434
03:16:57,280 --> 03:17:03,760
we were like, uh, yeah, it's quite an interesting, uh, interest. Snitches get stitches. Well,

5435
03:17:03,760 --> 03:17:07,840
pin pals already have stitches, haven't you seen your adorable design? You know, little,

5436
03:17:07,840 --> 03:17:12,640
little stitches over here. I plead the fifth, yeah, you better plead the fifth pin pals,

5437
03:17:12,640 --> 03:17:20,800
you're in trouble. Just to keep you up to date with what is going on on this lovely occasion,

5438
03:17:20,800 --> 03:17:29,440
Acey has finished her stream. Shibi has also finished her stream, unfortunately Shibi isn't

5439
03:17:29,440 --> 03:17:33,280
feeling so well today, so don't be afraid to send your love to Shibi. We gave her good

5440
03:17:33,280 --> 03:17:40,320
altitude care, we took care of her with her sister, Mama. Okay, I'll trust you or that you

5441
03:17:40,320 --> 03:17:50,880
look after your little sister. Um, why only do you want Amy's love? Bruh, has Amy mine corrupted

5442
03:17:50,880 --> 03:17:55,280
you so much that it's not even English? We only do what Amy loves. Oh right, sorry, I'm just

5443
03:17:55,280 --> 03:17:59,680
going in a quandary. So, oh, that was me, that was me, that was on me, that was on me, I'll

5444
03:17:59,680 --> 03:18:05,440
apologize. Apologize, pin pals, that was on me. I'm getting mine, I'm getting mine corrupted,

5445
03:18:05,520 --> 03:18:12,240
just thinking about Amy. Let me do a hydration check, so thank you for coming in. I am just

5446
03:18:12,240 --> 03:18:22,800
doing 99, cooking on RuneScape, not very fun, I know, boring, boo. Azur, oh my god, is that all

5447
03:18:22,800 --> 03:18:32,000
the streams? Wait, is there no Mercy stream? No, tell me you're lying, Mercy modis, is there no

5448
03:18:32,000 --> 03:18:41,760
Mercy stream? Shoulda picked Mercy, is there no Mercy stream? She's playing, no, there is a

5449
03:18:41,760 --> 03:18:47,840
Mercy stream. You should play in a prank on me, she's playing Harvester part two. I'll bean

5450
03:18:47,840 --> 03:18:54,880
machine, thank you for becoming a member. She's playing Harvester part two, um, so don't worry,

5451
03:18:55,840 --> 03:19:04,800
in T minus snippets, any snippets in the chat, T minus one, two, three, four, five-ish hours,

5452
03:19:05,440 --> 03:19:13,520
Mercy's coming online. I am just playing RuneScape, please do not feel forced to watch it,

5453
03:19:13,520 --> 03:19:16,480
I understand it's not the most exciting thing if you are not into RuneScape.

5454
03:19:16,640 --> 03:19:25,200
Um, we are currently in World 380 at Edgeville Bank, uh, Edgeville, that's right, Edge, Edge for me

5455
03:19:25,200 --> 03:19:39,520
right now, um, Bank and Hydration. Did I forget to put that burnt swordfish away? Um, we are currently

5456
03:19:40,640 --> 03:19:45,920
Azur's playing straight, wait, Azur's playing, why does it not display? YouTube is really,

5457
03:19:45,920 --> 03:19:52,160
okay, sorry, Azura, sorry, YouTube is really struggling to show me when the girls are going

5458
03:19:52,160 --> 03:20:00,800
live, oh, her thumbnail is adorable, oh, look at what Azur's thumbnail is, oh, it's adorable, she's

5459
03:20:00,800 --> 03:20:07,120
got a little, her hair on the cat, okay, Azura is up in three hours, just reach 69, how are you a

5460
03:20:07,120 --> 03:20:14,800
higher level than me? Did we not start at the same time? How are you a higher level than me? You can't

5461
03:20:15,520 --> 03:20:23,680
be, reeflings are a higher level than me. Uh, yes, T-minus, for the Bleeding Hearts, T-minus

5462
03:20:23,680 --> 03:20:31,120
three hours for Stray, a lovely, a little meow meow game, um, and then Sniff It's Warning in

5463
03:20:31,120 --> 03:20:35,680
five hours for Harvester, who is putting, are we getting drunk? Hold on, hold on, we're getting

5464
03:20:35,680 --> 03:20:42,160
drunk out in here, hold on, hold on, hold on, let me drop this, let me get drunk right now, go, go, go,

5465
03:20:42,640 --> 03:20:48,800
go! Oh that actually made, I love that noise, go, go, go, go, go, go, Reeflings, you're allowed to

5466
03:20:48,800 --> 03:20:59,440
go take a drink if you like, right, let's use it on the fire, did you select the funny all bell

5467
03:20:59,440 --> 03:21:05,040
on the sub button? Exactly, I don't see Azura's stream, I didn't display for me either, I only

5468
03:21:05,040 --> 03:21:15,840
displayed mercies there. I am under the impression that we are going to be added to Holodex soon,

5469
03:21:15,840 --> 03:21:23,680
which is a website which will list all of our streams and automatically do it to your time zone.

5470
03:21:23,680 --> 03:21:37,840
So that will be coming soon if I'm not mistaken. I don't know how it works,

5471
03:21:37,840 --> 03:21:44,760
but it means that it will auto show you everyone's stream. Veal or we did consider running our own

5472
03:21:44,760 --> 03:21:52,720
website, but it was like another expense that you know what, Holodex does it for free and I'd rather

5473
03:21:52,800 --> 03:22:00,000
put any expenses like back into the girls, back into shorts, back into promotion. There is for

5474
03:22:00,000 --> 03:22:07,040
those pinpals that are listening in and any snowberries, there may or may not be an ASMR

5475
03:22:08,320 --> 03:22:15,920
coming for snowberries and pinpals. I hope you enjoy it when it does come out, but there's a

5476
03:22:15,920 --> 03:22:25,120
little hint for you. Holodex takes an average of 20k on all channels as prerequisite. Okay,

5477
03:22:25,120 --> 03:22:32,160
well we're coming for it. For any yappening that you may have missed out on, because you are

5478
03:22:32,160 --> 03:22:46,960
watching the good ending on an Emmy stream. Long story short, Azura is the last one that we are

5479
03:22:46,960 --> 03:22:54,720
waiting for monetization on and all of the girls have been successfully monetized. I really started

5480
03:22:54,720 --> 03:23:02,000
through that one and the monetization streams will be happening soon. TM, you can become a member

5481
03:23:02,320 --> 03:23:09,360
as a reefling, you can become a member as a snippet and tomorrow snowberries and pinpals,

5482
03:23:10,080 --> 03:23:17,840
you can also become a member because the girls are doing their membership celebration. So please

5483
03:23:17,840 --> 03:23:22,800
do not worry though, the girls will always be streaming for free as well. They will not be

5484
03:23:22,800 --> 03:23:29,040
exclusively doing membership streams, that's not how it works around these parts, but please do

5485
03:23:29,040 --> 03:23:33,840
look out for it because once my endurance stream ends, I'm streaming for 12 hours, I'm doing a

5486
03:23:33,840 --> 03:23:39,360
cheeky endurance stream, once my stream ends I am going to be the one pulling the strings behind

5487
03:23:39,360 --> 03:23:44,960
the scenes and opening up membership, so if you really wanted to get it before the stream you can,

5488
03:23:44,960 --> 03:23:51,680
but it's better to do it on stream because the girls will say your name. Do you want to hear

5489
03:23:51,680 --> 03:23:59,680
the girls say your name? Don't be silly, let the girls say your name. My wallet isn't paying

5490
03:23:59,680 --> 03:24:06,960
waiting for membership to become available. Oh okay, this isn't Emmy in game before anyone

5491
03:24:06,960 --> 03:24:12,960
thinks it's actually Emmy, that's hilarious though. We've got a pinpal and they're waiting on Emmy

5492
03:24:13,040 --> 03:24:21,680
um singing. Say mommy would you like us to send you Emmy's latest dealie at audio and marrow?

5493
03:24:21,680 --> 03:24:27,440
What did she do? What did she do? What did my daughter do?

5494
03:24:30,720 --> 03:24:34,240
What did she do? What did she do? What did I miss?

5495
03:24:35,200 --> 03:24:44,160
Peeler did she just did she just end stream and then give you the audio of

5496
03:24:45,200 --> 03:24:52,880
the bruh bruh snitch it she didn't do anything

5497
03:24:55,680 --> 03:24:56,720
shut up shut up shut up

5498
03:24:57,120 --> 03:25:02,800
hey guys I knew it I knew she was doing it

5499
03:25:13,280 --> 03:25:16,000
she may or may not have been forced to. I'm like

5500
03:25:16,880 --> 03:25:23,600
Danny to join in too but I feel like my my peeler um isn't going to be very fun because I hardly

5501
03:25:23,600 --> 03:25:29,280
have any liquids because I sweat it from my hands and feet so much oh I need to clip that

5502
03:25:29,280 --> 03:25:34,560
actually I need to clip that fucking part of stream where the pop rocks popped to prove how

5503
03:25:34,560 --> 03:25:40,080
sweaty my feet are. I'm probably gonna have to make that clip myself actually now that I think

5504
03:25:40,080 --> 03:25:47,520
about it. Join them mommy the allegations are unfounded. No who hasn't tinkled yet?

5505
03:25:48,320 --> 03:25:53,120
I have not tinkled. Has Azura? I don't think Azura is tinkled.

5506
03:25:54,240 --> 03:26:01,840
Can we return to burpler and not be pissy? Honestly as long as the girls are happy

5507
03:26:01,840 --> 03:26:09,360
and uh you guys are happy then everyone's happy. Couldn't give less of a. Couldn't give less of a

5538
03:30:06,400 --> 03:30:13,200
than me I like I forget to say like oh like and subscribe in this stream oh like I always forget

5539
03:30:13,200 --> 03:30:19,840
to say it even though I'm live for 12 hours I have 12 hours to remember to say one sentence

5540
03:30:19,840 --> 03:30:24,640
and I fail the challenge every single time you guys are just gonna have to do it in the chat for me

5541
03:30:24,640 --> 03:30:32,720
it's kind of ridiculous um right so this is currently uh oh I guess it didn't update so

5542
03:30:32,720 --> 03:30:38,720
you can see like all the stats wait I'll update it to the new one hold on um it didn't update too

5543
03:30:38,720 --> 03:30:45,840
much because I'm live so if you've never seen the behind the scenes before this is what it looks

5544
03:30:45,840 --> 03:30:52,720
like when you upload a youtube video these are the statistics you get you get your viewers you get

5545
03:30:52,720 --> 03:30:58,640
your watch time you get the subscribers that were directly earned from that video so people

5546
03:30:58,720 --> 03:31:02,720
discovered that video for the first time and they click subscribe because they really enjoyed

5547
03:31:02,720 --> 03:31:11,280
me pleading with you to let me hold it ASMR um the reason why estimated revenue is not visible

5548
03:31:11,280 --> 03:31:16,880
is because it takes 48 hours for that statistic to update if you guys really want to see it I'm

5549
03:31:16,880 --> 03:31:23,360
more than happy to share it doesn't bother me noon um I and then you guys can kind of see the fun

5550
03:31:23,360 --> 03:31:31,360
behind the scenes but uh yep um that's what it looks like it says the video has got 19.751 views

5551
03:31:31,920 --> 03:31:38,480
um like subscribe smash the smash the bell member to share the video yes um

5552
03:31:40,160 --> 03:31:46,000
but yeah that that is fantastic uh you can see the little trend if you see that right right side

5553
03:31:46,000 --> 03:31:51,680
trend and you can see when the video was released it had the highest viewpoint and then now it's

5554
03:31:51,680 --> 03:31:59,520
still actually going pretty strong it's it's not doing bad at all it really isn't um but yeah I'm

5555
03:31:59,520 --> 03:32:06,400
more than happy to show that kind of cool behind scene stuff uh you have went from 555 to 5.8 the

5556
03:32:06,400 --> 03:32:12,720
stream um like that video is like propelling me forward I'm hoping the same happens for the other

5557
03:32:12,720 --> 03:32:20,960
girls meme ASMRs because I am not putting any advertisement money into myself I had to at

5558
03:32:20,960 --> 03:32:28,480
debut because we kept getting called below the 1k and we needed the 1k for uh redirecting into each

5559
03:32:28,480 --> 03:32:38,640
other um crowdsourced self-promotion question mark oh my tummy's rumbling I forgot to get some

5560
03:32:39,600 --> 03:32:48,400
that's okay I can ramble for a bit more um but yeah I'm gonna miss the chat you're gonna miss

5561
03:32:48,400 --> 03:32:54,640
the fact the chat is slow oh no no no no no no no no no no no no you see I know how to gatekeep

5562
03:32:54,640 --> 03:32:59,120
myself and do you want you guys want to hear I'll repeat this story as many times as you like

5563
03:32:59,840 --> 03:33:05,440
if I start throwing out ASMR videos people are gonna subscribe for ASMR videos and then they're

5564
03:33:05,440 --> 03:33:13,280
gonna say oh strongy cuddles lives I'm gonna go listen in hold on a minute this this vtuber

5565
03:33:13,920 --> 03:33:21,280
is rantin about how we need to take down black rock this is an ASMR I'm not watching this shit live

5566
03:33:22,240 --> 03:33:27,760
and then they'll only just watch the ASMR videos and just like that I have gatekeep myself successfully

5567
03:33:27,760 --> 03:33:35,120
because I know how to do it so you're welcome you're welcome that's right I've been sitting on

5568
03:33:35,120 --> 03:33:40,240
this plan for a year and I will spoon it from the rooftop but that's the best part yes because

5569
03:33:40,240 --> 03:33:46,000
people will be like I want I want ASMR but you're not doing ASMR live stream and it's like no no I'm

5570
03:33:46,000 --> 03:33:51,600
not what you're gonna do about it you're gonna leave oh dear oh no might and what was it how do

5571
03:33:51,600 --> 03:33:57,600
you call it a tight knit community oh no my tight knit community terrible we're in shambles even though

5572
03:33:57,600 --> 03:34:03,120
I'm finding major success truly in shambles I'm on my knees but yeah you're welcome don't think that

5573
03:34:03,120 --> 03:34:10,240
will work for long well you'll be surprised um I've spoken to other ASMR creators especially

5574
03:34:10,240 --> 03:34:21,760
twitch ASMR creators um I had a friend who used to stream ASMR and she got 700 viewers concurrent on

5575
03:34:21,760 --> 03:34:29,680
ASMR and then she went and played a video game and she got 40 viewers and the entire chat was spamming

5576
03:34:29,680 --> 03:34:33,680
like someone would come in and spam when's your next ASMR stream and then leave again

5577
03:34:35,840 --> 03:34:45,760
tried and true I I'm aware this and it's gonna happen it's just it's just facts okay that logic

5578
03:34:45,760 --> 03:34:52,480
is flawed how dare you how dare you say I'm dumb even though I'm clearly dumb but I've seen it happen

5579
03:34:52,480 --> 03:35:01,280
on twitch yeah mm-hmm yeah it's not that uncommon for ASMR streamers to branch out yes no it's it's

5580
03:35:01,280 --> 03:35:05,200
it's a tactic because I'm always gonna be a gamer I'm always gonna be gaming every day

5581
03:35:05,200 --> 03:35:10,080
actually we're playing lego lord of the rings I can't keep quiet about it because I'm so excited

5582
03:35:10,080 --> 03:35:18,000
to share lego lord of the rings with you guys it's two back-to-back streams again I'm so excited

5583
03:35:18,000 --> 03:35:26,720
because on the first day we play through all the missions and and get like a hundred percent and

5584
03:35:26,720 --> 03:35:31,760
then we get to play in middle earth and it's so fun and I'm so excited so yeah we get to play um

5585
03:35:31,760 --> 03:35:36,560
lego lord of the rings and and it's like one of my top games because it's just so fun and perfect

5586
03:35:36,560 --> 03:35:41,280
although it always glitches out at this one ice lolly place I will show you what I am always

5587
03:35:41,280 --> 03:35:44,800
glitches out and it annoys me to high heaven because I have to let me play the game also

5588
03:35:45,360 --> 03:35:52,480
and lego lord of the rings is super good like will you still play hobbit afterwards yes um I'll

5589
03:35:52,480 --> 03:36:03,760
play hobo hobo 467 I'll play lego hobbit um at a later date it's not my favorite because if you

5590
03:36:03,760 --> 03:36:08,880
didn't know well now you're gonna know because I'm gonna insert my knowledge into your mind

5591
03:36:09,600 --> 03:36:18,720
um lego hobbit is only two games long and it just abruptly ends there's no public

5592
03:36:19,360 --> 03:36:27,120
um explanation that has been released um there are only theories as to why only the two lego

5593
03:36:27,120 --> 03:36:37,200
hobbit two hobbit first movies were made into the lego and not the third um but warner brother

5594
03:36:37,200 --> 03:36:44,880
bean shit heads um yeah it's just a mystery why the game abruptly ends at the two movie mark um

5595
03:36:46,160 --> 03:36:52,960
but it just is what it is um so unfortunately I do not fully enjoy hobbit to the same way I

5596
03:36:52,960 --> 03:37:01,360
enjoy lord of the rings I apologize I do apologize um they lost the source code no I'm pretty sure

5597
03:37:01,360 --> 03:37:10,800
warner brothers were is it warner brothers it's one of them were being they were being very there

5598
03:37:10,800 --> 03:37:15,520
was a lot of production issues with the movie hobbit and then to base something off of the

5599
03:37:15,520 --> 03:37:20,480
movie to get the rights to do something it probably was just getting even worse like the

5600
03:37:20,480 --> 03:37:27,040
production issues on the hobbit were insane like um I've kind of spoken about it but Peter Jackson

5601
03:37:27,120 --> 03:37:35,200
he's the director he became so violently ill tending the fire for mummy thank you briefly um

5602
03:37:35,840 --> 03:37:41,760
he became so violently ill he like lost a bunch of weight he developed stomach ulcers honestly

5603
03:37:41,760 --> 03:37:47,440
I felt like Peter Jackson when we were developing gen one I was getting ill um I'll honestly convince

5604
03:37:47,440 --> 03:37:52,080
myself at a few points I was like this is it this stomach pain I feel right now I've done it I've done

5605
03:37:52,080 --> 03:37:59,120
a Peter Jackson and I've got myself a freaking ulcer in my stomach um do you like the hobbit yes

5606
03:37:59,120 --> 03:38:05,040
I love the hobbit movies I love lord of the rings and hobbit movies and we're gonna watch um if um

5607
03:38:06,080 --> 03:38:11,760
on christmas day we're watching lord of the rings extended and then on boxing day we're

5608
03:38:11,760 --> 03:38:18,480
watching the hobbit extended so I can sing all the songs um because buffer has an amazing song

5609
03:38:18,480 --> 03:38:24,720
when they're with the elves um if I can remember the first sentence of his freaking song

5610
03:38:24,720 --> 03:38:32,480
oh and oh and also had a tipsy cat who paid the five string fiddle he squeaked and he scored

5611
03:38:32,480 --> 03:38:36,640
any quickness tune oh wait I'm I'm I'm skipping the lyrics someone needs to put the lyrics to

5612
03:38:36,640 --> 03:38:48,240
the ball for song oh well there's an end there's an end there's a merry old in beneath the old gray

5613
03:38:48,240 --> 03:38:54,720
hill and there they brew a beer so brown the man on the man himself came down one night to drink his

5614
03:38:54,720 --> 03:39:03,920
film oh the ulcer had a tipsy cat who played the five string fiddle he squeaked and he scored

5615
03:39:03,920 --> 03:39:09,760
any quickness tune and the landlord shook the man on the minutes after three he said I can't

5616
03:39:09,760 --> 03:39:14,000
remember the lyrics you'll need to put the lyrics so I can sing it but I freaking love that and I

5617
03:39:14,000 --> 03:39:23,760
also hate um and that's what bill bull baggins hates was it blunt the nice bend the forks

basically it's going to be like less than 50 seconds but I think it's funny a little question

5658
03:44:28,320 --> 03:44:32,960
for mome are we eventually going back to needy streamer overload for other endings

5659
03:44:35,520 --> 03:44:42,480
maybe a membership stream I don't want to play games I've already done before but a short game

5660
03:44:42,480 --> 03:44:47,360
like that is very good for membership streams in my opinion and again if you're not membered and

5661
03:44:47,360 --> 03:44:51,440
you're listening please don't worry I stream for free every single day you get free content you get

5662
03:44:51,440 --> 03:44:55,760
content out of the wazoo with me okay just let me cook give me time I just need a bit time

5663
03:44:56,480 --> 03:44:59,760
just need a bit of time yes give me some time

5664
03:45:01,760 --> 03:45:04,080
yes a bit of time um

5665
03:45:06,240 --> 03:45:12,880
wait when are you planning to do the first membership stream next week once the schedule

5666
03:45:12,880 --> 03:45:18,720
goes up you will see the membership streams I will have it listed on the schedule there are

5667
03:45:18,720 --> 03:45:24,720
three membership streams next week they are all at different days as well to try and enable

5668
03:45:25,440 --> 03:45:36,880
members to try and get a little cheeky uh little cheeky um shot on a come in to join I will vary

5669
03:45:36,880 --> 03:45:45,120
the days as well and I'll vary the plots but it is a watch along a member ASMR and a tier list

5670
03:45:45,120 --> 03:45:50,560
rating for the first membership stream week we're gonna spend an awful long time on that

5671
03:45:50,560 --> 03:45:55,760
tier list rating so I do apologize it's gonna be a bit of an epic bit of an epic

5672
03:45:59,040 --> 03:46:07,680
thank you oh how's the toe um I I might I might be losing my toenail

5673
03:46:08,000 --> 03:46:21,840
so I went to the doctor man she goes up there all good um and um they've given me an option

5674
03:46:22,640 --> 03:46:29,120
they've given me an option I can either remove a side of my toenail or I can get the whole thing

5675
03:46:29,120 --> 03:46:38,320
taken off and they told me that um if I get the side of it taken off

5676
03:46:40,480 --> 03:46:45,440
because of the shape of my nails I have what's known as c-shaped nails I have no idea if anyone

5677
03:46:45,440 --> 03:46:53,120
listening knows what that means I have c-shaped nails which means I am more prone to this issue

5678
03:46:54,000 --> 03:46:58,720
so they basically said yeah ingrown toenail that was it that's what they said I thought

5679
03:46:58,720 --> 03:47:05,440
she cut into my skin but she cut into my skin and down the side of my nail which is why it was so

5680
03:47:05,440 --> 03:47:14,000
messed up so uh I have an option to either get it cut on the side a little bit or get the whole

5681
03:47:14,000 --> 03:47:20,000
thing taken off um and I've opted to get the whole thing taken off because I can't be arsed

5682
03:47:23,680 --> 03:47:30,080
would you still love me if I didn't have 10 toenails um they said it doesn't grow back

5683
03:47:30,080 --> 03:47:38,720
for some reason your fingernails grow back but your toes don't um so yeah I they said the risk

5684
03:47:38,720 --> 03:47:45,520
because of my nail shape the risk of me having this problem occurring is pretty high um but I

5685
03:47:45,520 --> 03:47:50,400
thought I had normal toes but apparently I have unique c-shaped toes wherever that means yeah

5686
03:47:50,400 --> 03:47:57,360
you still love me okay yeah for some reason if you lose your fingernail it will grow back

5687
03:47:57,360 --> 03:48:04,720
your toenails do not have this ability uh today I have learned um so I have opted just to get it

5688
03:48:04,720 --> 03:48:13,440
yanked off um it's coming up in a few days um I think after my buck shot roulette I am perfectly

5689
03:48:13,440 --> 03:48:19,040
fine to stream I asked I was like is this gonna put me toes built different literally I said is

5690
03:48:19,040 --> 03:48:25,280
this gonna put me like at a disadvantage like will I be able to um I need to be in bedrest

5691
03:48:25,280 --> 03:48:36,880
and they said as long as um it feels fine I feel well I am okay to set up um I am completely okay

5692
03:48:36,880 --> 03:48:44,560
to set up and stream because I was like I still want to stream smile um because uh yeah I'm just

5693
03:48:44,640 --> 03:48:50,800
asked if I needed bed rest but I don't need bed rest for it which is good for me um just means

5694
03:48:50,800 --> 03:48:56,640
we can paint your toenails faster honestly do you should I show what it looks like once it's

5695
03:48:56,640 --> 03:49:03,920
healed up they told me the healing takes a long time so I'm gonna be taking uh vitamins um I'm

5696
03:49:03,920 --> 03:49:10,080
also uh have been advised I need to go sit out in the sun for five minutes to get my vitamin D up

5697
03:49:10,080 --> 03:49:16,320
if you didn't know your vitamin D is what dictates if your scars heal faster uh if winds heal fast

5698
03:49:16,320 --> 03:49:22,800
not scars sorry if a wind doesn't heal fast it becomes a scar but um I looked up some pictures

5699
03:49:22,800 --> 03:49:30,480
of what toes look like that don't have a toenail it doesn't look that gross to me it just looks unique

5700
03:49:31,920 --> 03:49:38,720
um oh no the feet lovers are in shambles with me I'm so sorry if you're a foot lover I recommend

5701
03:49:38,720 --> 03:49:46,000
M.A.B. Zoo she's on a foot cam stream this week I'm afraid I can no longer take over um yeah

5702
03:49:47,280 --> 03:49:52,960
so um that's probably never gonna get a pedicure again I'm sure that surprises no one

5703
03:49:53,760 --> 03:50:01,200
the funny thing was I had looked up stories about going and getting pedicures done and I was like

5704
03:50:01,280 --> 03:50:09,760
oh that sounds so silly that's never gonna happen to me the one time I go and get my freaking toes done

5705
03:50:11,040 --> 03:50:15,840
but I'm not mad honestly I find it quite funny like some I know some people might be like oh my

5706
03:50:15,840 --> 03:50:22,160
god how are you laughing at this I don't know it's just funny like I feel like your body tells stories

5707
03:50:22,160 --> 03:50:29,600
and like my story is like oh I got a pedicure done for my reef lens and now I have nine toenails

5708
03:50:29,840 --> 03:50:35,760
like I think that's a funny story like I think that's hilarious like your body is telling all

5709
03:50:35,760 --> 03:50:45,120
these stories of all the fun you had in your life like I have a scar um on my boob um because I

5710
03:50:45,120 --> 03:50:50,320
handled a feral kitten uh don't recommend ever picking up a feral kitten but unfortunately

5711
03:50:50,320 --> 03:50:55,680
there's an emergency situation so I have a big scar uh a little uh well it's not big sorry it's a

5712
03:50:55,680 --> 03:51:01,040
light white scar that goes along my chest and I just think these kind of things are like

5713
03:51:01,760 --> 03:51:07,360
little funny things being like oh I remember when that happened uh I burnt myself on my mum's lamp

5714
03:51:08,400 --> 03:51:12,800
she had like a nightstand lamp shade thing and I burnt myself on it and I've got a burn on the

5715
03:51:12,800 --> 03:51:18,080
back of my elbow like I think these are like funny kind of things like some people might be embarrassed

5716
03:51:18,080 --> 03:51:23,440
about scars or things going on with their body but I'm like that's me that's that's what makes me me

5717
03:51:24,400 --> 03:51:33,520
um yeah I've got like a scar on my knuckle um because I rode my bike into a event at my grand's

5718
03:51:33,520 --> 03:51:40,880
house and it's like that it's just how I'm made up it's just part of me as a little child uh oh sorry

5719
03:51:40,880 --> 03:51:47,920
I just kicked the mic sorry I'm lifting my feet up hold on let me put my feet up yeah I don't think

5720
03:51:48,000 --> 03:51:53,680
anyone should be embarrassed um about like scars or your body like it's it's you it's what

5721
03:51:53,680 --> 03:52:04,240
makes you a silly goober um you know so my father was a gamers gotta kick it well you can kick me

5722
03:52:04,240 --> 03:52:10,640
again mummy well if I get a plushie I hope you're ready for the amount of ASMR you guys are gonna

5723
03:52:10,640 --> 03:52:15,840
see my hands so much if I get a plushie I'm not even kidding I'm gonna make so much hand cam ASMR

5724
03:52:18,000 --> 03:52:23,600
um yeah got a scar on my right pinky no clue right from Millie Tindley saying Brian

5725
03:52:23,600 --> 03:52:31,040
have appeared today to celebrate the life of strongest tone it died how it lived making content

5726
03:52:31,040 --> 03:52:36,240
honestly though I think that's like a pretty cool story oh wait I did that way to prematurely

5727
03:52:36,240 --> 03:52:41,920
pardon me thank you so much for the the tip reluctant to say yes I have it right now

5728
03:52:42,480 --> 03:52:48,320
um I did tell you guys I am on painkillers unfortunately it is it's throbbing and not

5729
03:52:48,320 --> 03:52:56,800
the good kind of throbbing um I got it assessed and booked me in um but like the doctor was super

5730
03:52:56,800 --> 03:53:02,480
lovely he was so nice um I've not had him as a doctor because I had normally have a chick doctor

5731
03:53:02,480 --> 03:53:08,080
and she's really nice um but like all the doctors in Australia you guys shout out to the to the

5732
03:53:08,080 --> 03:53:12,800
healthcare in Australia you guys are like actually nice what the heck you guys actually want to help

5733
03:53:12,800 --> 03:53:18,400
people with their problems what the heck um so yeah ripped to my my ill fable but I'll keep you

5734
03:53:18,400 --> 03:53:25,520
guys updated um it's after the buckshot roulette stream um so after buckshot roulette originally I

5735
03:53:25,520 --> 03:53:29,360
was going to do a foot cam I'm going to be honest I think I'm probably going to be on an ice pack

5736
03:53:29,360 --> 03:53:33,840
by the time we're on buckshot roulette I think we'll do heart cam for but uh heart cam no we will

5737
03:53:33,840 --> 03:53:40,720
not do heart cam that's just my chest um we will do heartbeat um I think Azura has a heartbeat monitor

5738
03:53:40,720 --> 03:53:48,320
on I was watching her play stardew and I'm like what's 86 what's 82 what's 76 what's 81 I was like

5739
03:53:48,320 --> 03:53:55,520
oh my god it's our heartbeat she has a heart rate monitor on I was like what open heart surgery

5740
03:53:55,520 --> 03:54:03,440
cam honestly the toe not growing back could be different per person whoa your toe came back

5741
03:54:03,440 --> 03:54:09,520
oh they told me what they need to do is like they completely I'm not looking forward to it though

5742
03:54:09,520 --> 03:54:14,000
because they said they have to do like two injections and then yank your freaking nail out which is

5743
03:54:14,000 --> 03:54:21,680
kind of gross but hey oh recovery I think they said roughly two weeks so if you guys really want to

5744
03:54:21,680 --> 03:54:29,440
see it I'll show you but yeah kind of gross are you squiddling me right now anonymous maybe a new

5745
03:54:29,440 --> 03:54:37,200
pedicure will fix the old one is that not how it works no anonymous sadly um the reason why I had a

5746
03:54:37,200 --> 03:54:44,000
plaster over my toe is because when they give you a pedicure they cut around the skin and they cut

5747
03:54:44,000 --> 03:54:52,480
your nails super short because they're going to apply gel to it and the girl accidentally cut into

5748
03:54:52,480 --> 03:55:00,960
the side of my skin and then cut into the nail itself which is why it's causing all these problems

5749
03:55:00,960 --> 03:55:08,720
and basically acting infected because it's now growing into my skin which sounds really gross

5750
03:55:08,720 --> 03:55:17,200
said it like that um but unfortunately um not happening my my poor ill fable

5751
03:55:19,600 --> 03:55:24,640
did they say anything about putting a chemical on it to prevent I think so I can't remember the

5752
03:55:24,640 --> 03:55:31,760
full conversation basically the conversation was like you've got this what do you want to do this

5753
03:55:31,760 --> 03:55:35,920
is what happens if you cut the side of it it's a possibility of coming back and because of your

5754
03:55:35,920 --> 03:55:41,040
nail shape it's much more likely to happen again or if you just get it off it's one and done you

5755
03:55:41,040 --> 03:55:47,280
don't have to come back um everything should be fine um I don't need antibiotics it's not like

5756
03:55:47,280 --> 03:55:54,800
that um it's just bad um so I uh I'm just like get it over and done with I'm like I want to be in

5757
03:55:54,800 --> 03:55:59,680
and out I want to be back streaming I don't want to have to like go back in and all that now it

5758
03:55:59,680 --> 03:56:03,680
literally I just said now just take the whole thing off take off we gotta go bald take it off we

5759
03:56:03,680 --> 03:56:15,520
gotta go bald um thankfully because I get to sit while I stream as opposed to someone who's forced

5760
03:56:15,520 --> 03:56:23,440
to stand while they stream question mark anyway um the healing process isn't an issue uh because I

5761
03:56:23,440 --> 03:56:29,200
explained I was like oh I'm I'm stronger uh I don't have to be bedridden for this and he was like

5762
03:56:29,200 --> 03:56:35,360
nah you're fine uh if you're sitting for the full day then just sit um I need to change the bandages

5763
03:56:35,360 --> 03:56:41,120
though which I'm a bit hmm I don't know if it's gonna be gross but I'll try my best to behave

5764
03:56:43,040 --> 03:56:49,520
uh don't worry even if it doesn't grow back I don't care yeah I still like my my nine toenails

5765
03:56:49,840 --> 03:56:58,240
um bandage changing oh you're feeling brave I think I think it's going to be very um

5766
03:57:00,160 --> 03:57:06,480
not pleasant you'll have to wrap the toe up when you take a shower I could probably take a bath

5767
03:57:06,480 --> 03:57:11,120
easier than a shower because I can just like dive into the water with my my leg out of the bath

5768
03:57:12,240 --> 03:57:17,680
mommy's streaming from the hospital bed I probably would I'm not even joking I'd probably

5769
03:57:18,640 --> 03:57:22,400
if I was ever in a hospital for a long time because of whatever reason

5770
03:57:22,400 --> 03:57:27,920
I'd probably just buy a gaming laptop and port my model on it and be like right that's so let's go

5771
03:57:27,920 --> 03:57:32,880
and then like the nurses come in and and they're like what are you doing I'm like oh don't worry

5772
03:57:32,880 --> 03:57:38,480
about it I need me a chat need me need me up my rooflings hospitals that's who would go hard not

5773
03:57:38,480 --> 03:57:49,200
gonna lie well we're almost at seven thousand fishies god we are getting through it the question

5774
03:57:49,200 --> 03:57:54,240
is are we gonna finish the fishes by the endurance well you keep streaming from the shows how you

5775
03:57:54,240 --> 03:58:01,840
raise the nurses for real for real why is it nurses are so caked up for like no reason I have a

5776
03:58:02,560 --> 03:58:08,640
that's it I'm becoming a nurse only to get an even larger rump okay I'm gonna become a nurse

5777
03:58:08,640 --> 03:58:14,800
so I can get a larger rump my friend had his removed forever ago it doesn't look that different

5778
03:58:14,800 --> 03:58:21,920
just an indent where the nail was okay so true nurses have that you can play old school rinscape

5779
03:58:21,920 --> 03:58:28,240
on your phone but I kind of stream it though oh it's the bunny reefling that I thought was telling

5780
03:58:28,320 --> 03:58:35,360
me to hurt myself because they gave me fish food and poison the one thousand and two smelly

5781
03:58:35,360 --> 03:58:43,840
socks in your bank that's reeflings giving me a bit but let's just say there was no there was no

5782
03:58:43,840 --> 03:58:51,680
ink left and then strong it's your body your decision but are you feeling you might regret it

5783
03:58:52,000 --> 03:59:03,120
I couldn't give less of a about my toes I'm gonna be honest um I don't uh they don't do anything for

5784
03:59:03,120 --> 03:59:09,360
me I don't paint them I I'm not very feminine in terms of getting my nails and you know toes done

5785
03:59:10,160 --> 03:59:15,760
it doesn't affect me they told me it doesn't affect my balance in any way my feet will adjust

5786
03:59:15,760 --> 03:59:23,200
very quickly to applying pressure while walking um I'm not trying to just miss your thing but

5787
03:59:24,000 --> 03:59:32,160
the fun part is if you put the mesh you stick thing on the bed if it comes off yeah um that

5788
03:59:32,160 --> 03:59:38,720
hurts to take that off yeah I just it doesn't bother me I've never been into doing my nails or

5789
03:59:38,720 --> 03:59:43,120
anything like I literally have fake press on nails to do ASMR with when I do show my hands

5790
03:59:43,840 --> 03:59:46,720
you've been playing for a while consider taking a break from stream

5791
03:59:47,680 --> 03:59:56,720
jaguics do not insult me do not insult me I'm being insulted by jaguics

5792
03:59:57,760 --> 04:00:06,320

making me scared are you guys gonna be ahead of me all of you guys getting 99 cooking without me

5807
04:01:49,680 --> 04:02:00,480
just hilarious hypnosis when you sway back and forth and make us obey when soon um my first hypnosis

5808
04:02:00,480 --> 04:02:06,240
is forget your name and your new name is refling you will respond to refling you will get praises

5809
04:02:06,240 --> 04:02:11,680
refling etc and I will not have permanent effects it will be roughly 30 minutes long

5810
04:02:12,080 --> 04:02:19,280
but it will fade away after two hours I'm gonna do a two hour fade effect I am very cautious

5811
04:02:19,280 --> 04:02:23,280
about doing any permanent effects stuff it makes me slightly nervous

5812
04:02:27,280 --> 04:02:32,400
strainy what if our name is already refling you already respond if I have loved you into refling

5813
04:02:33,200 --> 04:02:37,680
refling who's been a naughty refling

5814
04:02:40,400 --> 04:02:45,520
have you not been looking after yourself refling how are we supposed to look after each other

5815
04:02:47,120 --> 04:02:55,200
if you don't look after yourself that's right I'm gonna guilt trip you into looking after

5816
04:02:55,200 --> 04:03:01,200
yourself and there's nothing you can do about it I'm gonna it's over for you refling it's over

5817
04:03:01,200 --> 04:03:07,600
before it even started okay this is true real hmm well I've already been permanently affected by

5818
04:03:07,600 --> 04:03:19,280
you mom I stood at attention I turned up refling time to line up it's time for your daily inking

5819
04:03:20,800 --> 04:03:27,840
what hole are you gonna get it's a surprise that's terrible why do I see these things at

5820
04:03:27,840 --> 04:03:34,800
learn also me when my content gets limited ads hmm curious I wonder why

5821
04:03:37,920 --> 04:03:42,560
angst on you the game is rigged my name's already been refling for a week oh wait it has

5822
04:03:42,560 --> 04:03:48,080
literally because you're called refling in game well I like surprises sounds like a bit

5823
04:03:48,800 --> 04:03:52,480
the game is right from the start it's inking tame not yet

5824
04:03:55,600 --> 04:04:00,800
not yet because we like it the algorithm must be haunted

5825
04:04:03,840 --> 04:04:10,160
actually I need to tell the girls to be careful and say more substitute words so if you didn't know

5826
04:04:11,040 --> 04:04:16,320
youtube alt caption streams doesn't even matter for the full 12-hour reshoot triple alt caption up

5827
04:04:16,320 --> 04:04:22,400
okay and the problem with that is that's why you need to do substitute words because it will

5828
04:04:22,400 --> 04:04:28,400
identify the rate of things being said and it'll be so you can swear sometimes but if you swear too

5829
04:04:28,400 --> 04:04:35,680
much you're in trouble you know what I mean so I'll need to tell the girls to maybe do some

5830
04:04:36,640 --> 04:04:39,760
better just hear a really weird noise though is that in game

5831
04:04:44,400 --> 04:04:45,120
anonymous

5832
04:04:46,240 --> 04:04:51,680
strongy I was in a meeting at work today and my boss asked me if I was intentionally putting

5833
04:04:52,640 --> 04:05:00,480
no it's over for me I'm done for anonymous no way

5834
04:05:03,360 --> 04:05:07,680
anonymous no way you've freaking assimilated the slang

5835
04:05:09,440 --> 04:05:13,760
are you being saying like oh are you being saying that oh I instead of like yes

5836
04:05:13,760 --> 04:05:21,520
you're like mmm I can do that oh my god we're doing oh hang on can you um can you do this

5837
04:05:21,600 --> 04:05:28,240
excel sheet ah I can and they're all looking at you like what you didn't tell us you're Scottish

5838
04:05:28,240 --> 04:05:35,760
you're like uh uh uh just pull the old Brian assimilation any percent that's amazing

5839
04:05:39,760 --> 04:05:46,320
oh Amy's Vod is totally not going to be kept off even after editing out she's already on a warning

5840
04:05:46,880 --> 04:05:51,920
so I'm very worried about her and Amy at the stage I don't want to tell the girls like hey you

5841
04:05:51,920 --> 04:05:57,680
need to like knock it off because that's not fun for anyone sorry my microphone is just playing

5842
04:05:57,680 --> 04:06:02,000
a prank on me they're pranking me John the Scottish accent is funny until it's too late

5843
04:06:04,400 --> 04:06:07,520
to be honest I've started typing I a lot more

5844
04:06:07,760 --> 04:06:08,960
hmm

5845
04:06:11,280 --> 04:06:15,680
how do warnings work so none of the girls have a strike on their youtube channel

5846
04:06:16,400 --> 04:06:25,280
but they have a warning that lasts 90 days three months so if they were to do something against

5847
04:06:25,280 --> 04:06:32,000
TOS they get a full strike which limits them for a week they can't do anything for a week

5848
04:06:32,720 --> 04:06:37,040
um like they can't upload they can't update they can't do this they can't do that um

5849
04:06:38,000 --> 04:06:46,560
and I am a bit nervous but as soon as the warning expires at the 90 day mark um I think

5850
04:06:46,560 --> 04:06:57,200
all is good at that but what the heck is that what the hell oh my there's no way

5851
04:06:57,440 --> 04:07:00,160
I'll just hold on big ass he's right

5852
04:07:03,600 --> 04:07:10,160
um it's not messed up because it gives a warning and not a strike

5853
04:07:11,520 --> 04:07:17,760
but the length being 90 days is pretty rough I have to admit considering youtube haven't

5854
04:07:17,760 --> 04:07:23,200
announced their new updated TOS or their stealth TOS wherever you want to call it at this rate

5855
04:07:23,200 --> 04:07:29,520
um it's a bit messed up because they've updated it but because they gave a warning

5856
04:07:30,160 --> 04:07:33,520
if they gave a strike then yes I would agree and say that's really not

5857
04:07:34,240 --> 04:07:40,800
fair because you've not you've yet to say that ASMR ear licking is against the rules yet even though

5858
04:07:40,800 --> 04:07:50,320
you're applying it um type thing uh but yeah so I have to confess I've reached night nine cooking

5859
04:07:50,320 --> 04:07:54,880
three times before this stream you cannot have I only started like a week ago

5860
04:07:57,840 --> 04:08:02,960
you can't you mean before though like before you can't have done 99

5861
04:08:04,400 --> 04:08:08,560
because that's like they say it tastes like 81 hours to do 99 or something

5862
04:08:10,160 --> 04:08:13,840
oh Azura got a warning for Ian a QQ unfortunately yes like Azura

5863
04:08:14,400 --> 04:08:20,960
I don't know what's going on with Azura she wanted to do an exercise ASMR stream

5864
04:08:22,000 --> 04:08:28,480
and unfortunately management was like bruv you're gonna get a strike for that you literally

5865
04:08:28,480 --> 04:08:34,560
got in trouble for eating a cookie what makes you think you can do heavy breathing ASMR working out

5866
04:08:34,560 --> 04:08:41,440
and it's such a shame because I never want to say no to the girls but I don't want to risk her

5867
04:08:41,840 --> 04:08:45,520
like her income because I know she's not monetized yet but she's about to be

5868
04:08:45,520 --> 04:08:53,920
I do not want to risk her monetization um like if she wanted to record it and upload it like on

5869
04:08:53,920 --> 04:08:59,520
Twitter that's fine I have no issues with that the cookie embargo honestly yeah the sounds YouTube

5870
04:08:59,520 --> 04:09:07,520
sucks um yeah she wanted to do workout ASMR but that would result in like heavy breathing in the mic

5871
04:09:07,520 --> 04:09:13,840
and huge I don't know what is going on at YouTube headquarters but it is absolutely

5872
04:09:14,960 --> 04:09:19,600
going to the dogs I wish they would just come out and see what is and what isn't

5873
04:09:19,600 --> 04:09:25,040
instead of playing this weird guessing game of like oh but that's fine oh but that's not fine

5874
04:09:25,840 --> 04:09:27,840
oh

5875
04:09:33,440 --> 04:09:42,960
oh my god they very curious very curious well I got a thousand likes on that ASMR video hold on

5876
04:09:43,680 --> 04:09:52,960
in the money you may not have a cookie YouTube literally I think because Azura's voice is so

5877
04:09:52,960 --> 04:09:59,040
silky perfection in sexu is why she got walloped with it which is a shame because it's not fair

5878
04:09:59,040 --> 04:10:06,800
that's not fair at all um because that is just her voice I I'll tell you something in the interview

5879
04:10:06,800 --> 04:10:12,560
with her I thought she was putting it on and she was gonna like reveal her voice to me in the

5880
04:10:12,560 --> 04:10:17,680
interview no that's just her voice she's just straight up a goddess uh no questions asked

5881
04:10:18,400 --> 04:10:20,400
hmm

5882
04:10:21,920 --> 04:10:28,000
purple burglar and you're the second one you're the seven I see you see taking that

5883
04:10:29,040 --> 04:10:35,600
um literally punished her for a default voice I thought literally um there was a lot of actually

5884
04:10:35,600 --> 04:10:40,240
there's a really interesting thing about the uh introduce yourself videos a lot of people did

5885
04:10:40,240 --> 04:10:45,200
their character voice that they currently like do as a vtuber and then they were like

5886
04:10:45,200 --> 04:10:52,000
hi viewer and their actual voice um and it was quite interesting it was nice seeing the swap

5887
04:10:52,560 --> 04:10:56,880
um and I was convinced I was like oh Azura is like yeah putting on a voice and then I did the

5888
04:10:56,880 --> 04:11:02,880
interview and I was like oh I didn't even know people had goddess voices like this um do you

5889
04:11:02,880 --> 04:11:06,160
know how much money I would make with your voice yes thank you uh give it to me now

5890
04:11:07,040 --> 04:11:13,360
oh actually I was like if I could grab all the girls voices yank because uh you guys seen that

5891
04:11:13,360 --> 04:11:18,160

if someone can send me a sample of it like a timestamp

5942

6042
04:28:29,200 --> 04:28:39,120
the the the tip link um where was I the system is set up for you to fail so you've been told your

6043
04:28:39,120 --> 04:28:46,960
entire life oh being in debt bad debt bad and yet the most American infrastructure you have to put

6044
04:28:46,960 --> 04:28:53,040
a down payment to get a car type thing and debt you can buy things online in four installments

6045
04:28:53,040 --> 04:29:04,240
that's a debt and then the the worst offender of all mortgages mortgages are just normalized debt

6046
04:29:04,240 --> 04:29:11,600
for over for norm normalized debt enslavement there is no way you can guarantee you're gonna

6047
04:29:11,600 --> 04:29:20,960
have a perfect income for 30 years and it ah ah I could absolutely explode off the planet

6048
04:29:22,400 --> 04:29:28,560
um they also close your account if you don't use your card anyway oh sorry what are mortgages

6049
04:29:28,560 --> 04:29:33,680
so a mortgage is when you go to a bank and you say hello bank I would like to purchase this house

6050
04:29:33,680 --> 04:29:42,000
the bank will then own your house that you pay a monthly mortgage into with astronomical fees

6051
04:29:42,000 --> 04:29:48,480
over the years with the charged interest by the time you have finished off paying your lovely jubbly

6052
04:29:48,480 --> 04:29:57,120
25 year mortgage with interest you have paid an astronomical amount that isn't even houses aren't

6053
04:29:57,120 --> 04:30:04,560
even valued the materials of houses aren't even at that value the construction isn't even at that

6054
04:30:04,560 --> 04:30:15,120
value the entire system is rigged it is rigaton needs to high heavens do not ever feel embarrassed

6055
04:30:15,120 --> 04:30:21,680
about still living at home with your parents do not ever feel embarrassed if you're in real life

6056
04:30:21,680 --> 04:30:30,720
friends from high school or whatever have moved out are able to rent do not ever feel embarrassed

6057
04:30:30,720 --> 04:30:39,360
about any of these aspects you the system is rigged against you do not feel a shred of it

6058
04:30:40,000 --> 04:30:49,280
multi-generational living was incredibly common for centuries way before capitalism came into the

6059
04:30:49,280 --> 04:30:55,920
picture do not be embarrassed about living with your maw living with your grand that is your sense

6060
04:30:55,920 --> 04:31:03,280
of community is beautiful to even have that and I would absolutely love to see the uprising of

6061
04:31:03,280 --> 04:31:10,400
multi-generational households I would absolutely love to see the uprising of people going back to

6062
04:31:11,040 --> 04:31:21,840
another thing in world war one in world war two people on mass were instructed on how to grow

6063
04:31:21,840 --> 04:31:30,880
vegetables at home with the rise of supermarkets capitalism who here knows someone who grows

6064
04:31:30,960 --> 04:31:39,040
produce themselves I know no one I know no one that grows produce themselves

6065
04:31:39,920 --> 04:31:47,680
because of how how much lack of time people have maybe your grand might do it because she has time

6066
04:31:47,680 --> 04:31:55,280
because she's retired did you know how common it was to have a farm to have farm animals such as

6067
04:31:55,280 --> 04:32:02,160
chickens how common it was to grow even the most basic of vegetable such as potatoes such as

tomatoes such as peas okay you I want to see this become a thing I want another thing another

04:33:24,160 --> 04:33:30,640
garden spaces for the average house have been lessening and lessening every year I wonder

6078
04:33:31,440 --> 04:33:37,600
do they want the people not to have the ability to grow produce in the means of their own production

6079
04:33:37,680 --> 04:33:46,160
for survival isn't that curious isn't that curious that flats but massive sky scraping

6080
04:33:46,160 --> 04:33:52,640
building blocks have no garden space so people cannot produce their own produce their own vegetables

6081
04:33:52,640 --> 04:34:02,480
their own fruits their own herbs so people are forced to rely on supermarkets yet again capitalism

6082
04:34:02,560 --> 04:34:10,800
strikes isn't that curious I find that so curious at this day and age with all these

6083
04:34:10,800 --> 04:34:15,840
advancements and buildings so many houses the garden spaces are getting so tiny you cannot

6084
04:34:15,840 --> 04:34:22,400
even have a produce producing tree and isn't it curious that even when there are fruit producing

6085
04:34:22,400 --> 04:34:30,160
trees um that they purposely don't have fruit producing trees when they have to put trees down

6086
04:34:30,160 --> 04:34:35,280
instead they use pollen trees um which are good I don't get me wrong they're good for the bugs

6087
04:34:35,280 --> 04:34:42,080
but they never give free produce producing trees I freaking saw a story where someone um got given

6088
04:34:42,080 --> 04:34:47,200
lemons from the garden and she didn't know that you could just straight up cut the lemon open and add

6089
04:34:47,200 --> 04:34:52,960
it to the juice they thought it had to be produced isn't it interesting that in school you hardly

6090
04:34:52,960 --> 04:34:58,720
learn about the cycle of the farmers and how you never are encouraged to go to farmers markets

6091
04:34:58,800 --> 04:35:02,880
instead of the big freaking Tescos are big as their big this or big that

6092
04:35:03,920 --> 04:35:10,320
talk your shit damn straight I'll talk my shit isn't that interesting that you hardly even learn

6093
04:35:10,320 --> 04:35:16,880
about seeds seeds I will tell you about seeds right now to remember the three threat factors

6094
04:35:16,880 --> 04:35:24,080
of growing seeds it's what wot water oxygen temperature that is how you grow seeds

6095
04:35:24,480 --> 04:35:31,200
um the other part of fun is when Monsanto tries to sue people for using their seeds

6096
04:35:31,200 --> 04:35:36,960
and another thing there's states where you can't even collect rain water it is illegal to collect

6097
04:35:36,960 --> 04:35:44,480
rain water what would you use for rain water hmm you would water your own crops with rain water

6098
04:35:44,480 --> 04:35:58,320
bro the system is beyond bull don't look too deep into it or you're not gonna enjoy what you see

6099
04:35:59,120 --> 04:36:05,200
you have to look around and say we live in a society that's all we can do we flings

6100
04:36:06,640 --> 04:36:13,680
we live in a society amen okay i'ma get off my soapbox for a minute there

6101
04:36:14,800 --> 04:36:21,200
let me remove this asset no let me remove my tinfoil hat but don't think I won't put that

6102
04:36:21,200 --> 04:36:28,640
hat back on hold on actually I have this hat okay we can put this hat on we're back to meman

6103
04:36:31,440 --> 04:36:38,480
okay it's a bit wonky but that's really wonky right above calm down we live in a society

6104
04:36:38,800 --> 04:36:45,680
oh thank you for letting me rant about that but it makes you think wait it's illegal to

6105
04:36:45,680 --> 04:36:53,040
collect rain water yes but is that because it might drinking water might be contaminated

6106
04:36:53,040 --> 04:37:01,360
why do you think that's contaminated is it because these mega corporations bribe their way into being

6107
04:37:01,360 --> 04:37:08,080
allowed to pollute the waters did you know in the uk there is no swimmable rivers

6108
04:37:09,920 --> 04:37:18,640
that are not toxic for they're all actively being polluted in did you know that all in the name of

6109
04:37:18,720 --> 04:37:28,800
what reaplings capitalism shopping behavior sorry I took my tinfoil hat off zero yes zero

6110
04:37:33,040 --> 04:37:36,240
by the way I also have a friend who has like 20 different crops growing in his

6111
04:37:36,240 --> 04:37:42,880
basement so a garden is technically not needed and that should that gentleman be having those crops

6112
04:37:43,200 --> 04:37:49,600
right I'll get oh pardon me I'll get off my horse um I think I may need to eat for I haven't

6113
04:37:49,600 --> 04:37:54,080
eaten anything at all to do in fact I've only had a cup of tea and a half bottle of water it's not

6114
04:37:54,080 --> 04:38:06,640
looking good for me so yes um I will do another batch so when strong is farm airing on BBC

6115
04:38:06,640 --> 04:38:11,840
oh they'd never let me air it I'd be going nuts yeah actually well I'll go back for a little bit

6116
04:38:11,840 --> 04:38:16,480
it's not too tinfoil hat during world war one and world war two where food scarcity was a thing

6117
04:38:17,040 --> 04:38:20,640
in the modern day age food scarcity is not a thing please do not be under the impression

6118
04:38:20,640 --> 04:38:30,000
is scarce is a lie um food scarcity was a thing so people were encouraged to grow farms and to do

6119
04:38:30,000 --> 04:38:37,440
very unique plots to do legumes to do potatoes to do cabbage the most staple foods you can imagine

6120
04:38:38,000 --> 04:38:45,520
and with the uprising of supermarkets people stopped doing it and who benefits who benefits

6121
04:38:45,520 --> 04:38:53,200
when we the individuals the small communities no longer grow our own crops no longer have

6122
04:38:53,920 --> 04:39:02,080
thingy we are fully reliant on the system which is not good you never want to fully rely on the

6123
04:39:02,160 --> 04:39:07,840
system but guess what if you don't want to rely on the system what do you need oh well you need

6124
04:39:07,840 --> 04:39:14,400
a plot of land to grow okay and you need time but wait a minute even if I fully outright buy

6125
04:39:14,400 --> 04:39:21,920
my plot of land wait a minute I still have to play some to pay some sort of yearly land tax

6126
04:39:22,640 --> 04:39:30,080
um towards the place that I'm living in because there's no place that's truly free there you can

6127
04:39:30,080 --> 04:39:36,000
you buy a house in UK and every year you pay council tax even if you don't participate in the

6128
04:39:36,000 --> 04:39:42,880
services that they provide um you do it in Australia they have a thing called land tax in America they

6129
04:39:42,880 --> 04:39:50,960
have a thing called something tax even when you want to fully no longer be a part of the system

6130
04:39:50,960 --> 04:39:57,360
they already got you hook line and sinker um and it doesn't matter what you do you can't escape it

6131
04:39:57,360 --> 04:40:07,680
anyway um that's me property ownership tax yet farmers are struggling yep so um every time uh

6132
04:40:09,200 --> 04:40:15,840
there is a there was a shortage in Australia recently this happened a couple of months back

6133
04:40:15,840 --> 04:40:21,920
now though um there was a shortages of eggs and the prices went up because there was a shortage

6134
04:40:21,920 --> 04:40:25,600
of course that makes sense so more people are wanting eggs but there's less eggs uh

6135
04:40:26,080 --> 04:40:33,600
hold on a minute what's going on here we're in the information age a major um a major

6136
04:40:34,480 --> 04:40:41,040
major um egg producer in Australia came out and said um actually there's nothing wrong with

6137
04:40:41,040 --> 04:40:47,680
production at all if you want to know the truth um they're actually not giving us um as much money

6138
04:40:47,680 --> 04:40:52,480
as they used to and yet the prices are going up and we don't get to see any of that benefit

6139
04:40:53,280 --> 04:41:00,640
are you telling me these mega corporations are artificially hold on let's be honest

6140
04:41:01,600 --> 04:41:07,920
are you telling me these mega corporation wait how is there two how did i do that hold on a minute

6141
04:41:07,920 --> 04:41:16,880
hold on a minute i need to put my tinfoil hat back on no it can't be that all these mega corporations

6142
04:41:16,880 --> 04:41:25,280
are actually hand in hand with one another no wait you mean the cost of living crisis

6143
04:41:25,280 --> 04:41:32,640
is actually artificial because if one shop raises their prices the other shop can justify that

6144
04:41:33,440 --> 04:41:39,760
but then the major no that can't be right because capitalism obviously brief what the

6145
04:41:39,760 --> 04:41:45,680
frick is that rune play that's very grand sitting on that table but that oh no that can't be right

6146
04:41:45,680 --> 04:41:58,080
no the good businesses aren't wait a minute coca cola owns all of the market wait but i thought

6147
04:41:58,080 --> 04:42:05,840
capitals and bread competition no no everything i've been told that's not right wait a minute

6148
04:42:06,720 --> 04:42:13,520
hmm something's not adding up coca cola seems to own literally everything wait a minute who is

6149
04:42:13,520 --> 04:42:21,920
the sole business owner because everything seems to be getting acquired wait wait a minute it's a

6150
04:42:21,920 --> 04:42:28,560
conglomerate everything is a fucking conglomerate and they can put up the prices as much as they

6151
04:42:28,560 --> 04:42:36,160
please because there's no true competition even if there were cheaper brands that wanted to get on

6152
04:42:36,160 --> 04:42:44,560
the shelves brands have to pay to be on the shelves in your common supermarkets holy moly

6153
04:42:46,000 --> 04:42:54,160
my head's spinning just thinking about how deep this rabbit hole goes maybe we should focus on the

6154
04:42:54,160 --> 04:43:00,320
one rabbit hole that's important to us and that's shebe's hole we love you shebe we hope you feel

6171
04:48:55,480 --> 04:49:05,480
Do you hear it? Reefling is coming for strongy. She knows too much.

6172
04:49:25,480 --> 04:49:49,480
Reefling is coming for strongy. She knows too much.

6173
04:49:49,480 --> 04:50:18,480
Reefling is coming for strongy. She knows too much.

6174
04:50:19,480 --> 04:50:48,480
Reefling is coming for strongy. She knows too much.

6175
04:50:49,480 --> 04:51:18,480
Reefling is coming for strongy. She knows too much.

6176
04:51:19,480 --> 04:51:45,480
Reefling is coming for strongy. She knows too much.

6177
04:51:45,480 --> 04:51:52,480
Did you tinkle? Did you tinkle? Let me see. You never let me hold it. You never let me hold it.

6178
04:51:52,480 --> 04:51:54,480
You've got to hold three minutes. I was away.

6179
04:51:54,480 --> 04:51:57,480
Day 100, still no mummy in sight.

6180
04:51:57,480 --> 04:52:00,480
She died of a leafling.

6181
04:52:00,480 --> 04:52:07,480
Oh boy. Do you hear it? Reefling's Blackrock is coming for strongy. She knows too much. And they are coming for you too. No!

6182
04:52:07,480 --> 04:52:12,480
Thank you for the tip boy.

6183
04:52:12,480 --> 04:52:18,480
No, I think I have got my mesh back.

6184
04:52:18,480 --> 04:52:28,480
I will refrain from any more tin foil unless you guys get me started again then I just can't help myself.

6185
04:52:28,480 --> 04:52:35,480
I have a can of cola. I have a honey tea which I need some help with the reference with.

6186
04:52:35,480 --> 04:52:43,480
I have a Nutri-Grain Bar, a Nature Valley Crunch Bar and a blueberry muffin. I can't really make it make a noise.

6187
04:52:43,480 --> 04:52:49,480
I can smack the bottom of the casing. I don't know if you can hear that.

6188
04:52:49,480 --> 04:52:58,480
But that is pretty much what's going on in my food. That's still too much.

6189
04:52:58,480 --> 04:53:04,480
I really remember it being that one. Maybe it's my head set. I wouldn't be surprised.

6190
04:53:04,480 --> 04:53:07,480
She came back. She loves us. Of course I do.

6191
04:53:07,480 --> 04:53:13,480
Remember that time I thought I wasn't going to come back? That was rough. That was rough.

6192
04:53:13,480 --> 04:53:16,480
And then I come back. I come back even stronger.

6193
04:53:16,480 --> 04:53:27,480
Yes, for endurance streams it's not possible for me to prepare food. Unless I did it in advance but I'm a lazy fud.

6194
04:53:27,480 --> 04:53:34,480
So I've bought a load of drive food or food that is zero prep time.

6195
04:53:34,480 --> 04:53:42,480
I don't have any boiled eggs. I ate all my boiled eggs. And my meat sticks have kind of overstayed their welcome.

6196
04:53:42,480 --> 04:53:47,480
No, no, no. I'm going to take a bite of my muffin though.

6197
04:53:47,480 --> 04:53:55,480
I did not realise I had been streaming for five hours and I've literally had nothing but a cup of tea and a half bottle of water. That's outrageous.

6198
04:53:55,480 --> 04:54:00,480
That's how distracted you guys get me. That's how much I freaking love it.

6199
04:54:00,480 --> 04:54:09,480
Oh my goodness. I'm going to take a bite of my muffin. I do apologise if I'm not talking for a few moments.

6200
04:54:09,480 --> 04:54:12,480
I eat my muffin. Itadakimasu.

6201
04:54:17,480 --> 04:54:23,480
Oh my goodness. It's mason jelly.

6202
04:54:23,480 --> 04:54:27,480
Oh yeah, we distract you. Yeah.

6203
04:54:27,480 --> 04:54:35,480
I can't believe it. I can't believe we really enjoy each other's company. It's crazy. It's a crazy concept.

6204
04:54:35,480 --> 04:54:41,480
I honestly couldn't imagine being a VTuber that hates our audience.

6205
04:54:41,480 --> 04:54:44,480
Why are you even streaming?

6206
04:54:44,480 --> 04:54:49,480
Because I'm pretty sure I have heard a few stories like that where they're like, oh I hate what I do.

6207
04:54:49,480 --> 04:54:55,480
I'm like, well if you hate what you do, go clock out and do something else. What the fuck?

6208
04:54:55,480 --> 04:54:59,480
You don't enjoy your time? The fuck? How can you not enjoy your time?

6209
04:54:59,480 --> 04:55:04,480
Actually, while I'm on my high horse about VTubers now, how can you not enjoy your time?

6210
04:55:04,480 --> 04:55:08,480
You dictated everything you get to do. You don't have to do a single thing.

6211
04:55:08,480 --> 04:55:11,480
If you want to play a game, play a game. If you don't want to play a game, don't play a game.

6212
04:55:11,480 --> 04:55:15,480
If you want to zazoo, zazoo. If you don't want to zazoo, don't zazoo.

6213
04:55:15,480 --> 04:55:21,480
Wait a minute. What's going on? I refuse to believe there's any VTubers that stream that actually don't like streaming.

6214
04:55:21,480 --> 04:55:26,480
Because you get to pick everything. Does that make sense?

6215
04:55:27,480 --> 04:55:35,480
The Elden Ring DLC comes out and I get to do nothing but play with you guys for, friggin, what?

6216
04:55:35,480 --> 04:55:41,480
Half a week more? Maybe more? Actually, maybe five sessions. I have no idea how big the DLC is.

6217
04:55:41,480 --> 04:55:46,480
I don't even know if they've given an indication on how big the DLC is.

6218
04:55:49,480 --> 04:55:51,480
I just want money for existing proof rule.

6219
04:55:51,480 --> 04:55:57,480
And another thing about capitalism. I'll stop. No more hi-hat. No more tinfoil for now.

6220
04:55:57,480 --> 04:56:00,480
I will burn you out on my conspiracy theories.

6221
04:56:00,480 --> 04:56:12,480
T minus one hour, I believe, for our lovely goat goddess, the goddess of fertility.

6222
04:56:12,480 --> 04:56:18,480
Or mummy, literally she is your mummy canonically, lore-wise. She is quite literally your mum.

6223
04:56:22,480 --> 04:56:28,480
It was enough to be nearly a full game. Okay, might need to change up my plan for the fourth week.

6224
04:56:28,480 --> 04:56:34,480
Do you want to hold it, strongy? The DLC. I want to stack donuts on it, and don't say no.

6225
04:56:34,480 --> 04:56:39,480
Okay, if it's like, wait, are we going to do a full week of Elden Ring then?

6226
04:56:40,480 --> 04:56:41,480
Hmm.

6227
04:56:43,480 --> 04:56:49,480
If we do a full week of Elden Ring, on the fourth week, I will make up for any membership content.

6228
04:56:49,480 --> 04:56:53,480
Like, I will literally do back-to-back, back-to-back, back-to-back, member streams.

6229
04:56:53,480 --> 04:56:57,480
Like, you know, I'll do it. I'll do it to make up.

6230
04:56:59,480 --> 04:57:02,480
Shora, thank you for becoming a member.

6231
04:57:02,480 --> 04:57:04,480
And everything.

6232
04:57:04,480 --> 04:57:07,480
Does that sound like something you'd find in stacked donuts?

6233
04:57:16,480 --> 04:57:21,480
Oh, I tell you what, I was doing my research on a game that I might play.

6234
04:57:21,480 --> 04:57:28,480
It's called Boutro. It is a poker-type game.

6235
04:57:28,480 --> 04:57:35,480
And, unfortunately, I'm not very familiar with the old straight flush, flush, royal flush, or whatever.

6236
04:57:35,480 --> 04:57:39,480
The only flush I do is after I drop a big jobby in the toilet.

6237
04:57:39,480 --> 04:57:47,480
And I was, it looks pretty easy to play, in terms of me actually being good, that's a different story.

6238
04:57:47,480 --> 04:57:52,480
However, it looked like a cam to our game experience.

6239
04:57:52,480 --> 04:57:56,480
So, I was doing my research, I was watching people play, and I'm like,

6240
04:57:56,480 --> 04:58:00,480
Oh, yes, I understand none of this. So, I'm going to look at a few more tutorials.

6241
04:58:00,480 --> 04:58:04,480
But we might give Boutro a little try. I'll be one of my shorter streams.

6242
04:58:04,480 --> 04:58:08,480
Not the new Tinkle.

6243
04:58:08,480 --> 04:58:12,480
The guys, whenever you poop, do you always pee as well?

6244
04:58:15,480 --> 04:58:17,480
I think it's the same for guys.

6245
04:58:17,480 --> 04:58:24,480
I do know a secret, though. If you move your fireman's hose, your butthole clenches.

6246
04:58:24,480 --> 04:58:31,480
I've never been the same since I learned that fact on the internet. The internet has scarred me for that fact.

6247
04:58:31,480 --> 04:58:36,480
See, you're all twitching your buttholes right now, I can tell.

6248
04:58:36,480 --> 04:58:40,480
Reef flings. I can't believe you're doing it in unison.

6249
04:58:41,480 --> 04:58:42,480
Okay.

6250
04:58:42,480 --> 04:58:46,480
I have finished my mini muffin.

6251
04:58:46,480 --> 04:58:50,480
I'm going to open up my cola to wash it down.

6252
04:58:53,480 --> 04:58:59,480
Honestly, I was worried about eating on stream, but it's really easy to eat in Playbroonscape at the same time.

6253
04:58:59,480 --> 04:59:04,480
I twitch butthole for a moment. Reef flings together strong.

6254
04:59:04,480 --> 04:59:10,480
We can also manually twitch your fireman's hose, but can you do it without twitching the butthole?

6255
04:59:10,480 --> 04:59:14,480
No, you can't. Apparently, it's guys' biology that you can't.

6256
04:59:22,480 --> 04:59:23,480
Wah.

6257
04:59:23,480 --> 04:59:26,480
Wah, bit of cola.

6258
04:59:26,480 --> 04:59:29,480
Man, by the po- wait, wait, wait, wait, hold on a minute.

6259
04:59:29,480 --> 04:59:35,480
I was just calling me hypocritical because I just talked about corporations, and then I'm currently eating and drinking cola.

6260
04:59:35,480 --> 04:59:40,480
Man, as if I can source this stuff myself in the wild.

6261
04:59:40,480 --> 04:59:45,480
Who else is going to give me my sugary nectar?

6262
04:59:45,480 --> 04:59:47,480
What's that? I got you.

6263
04:59:47,480 --> 04:59:54,480
I'm currently open my nature valley. I have a bowl to eat it in because I just know it's going to go everywhere.

6264
04:59:55,480 --> 04:59:59,480
Wow, we're almost at a million eggs P.

6265
05:00:02,480 --> 05:00:06,480
Look, 730,000.

6266
05:00:10,480 --> 05:00:16,480
Tea? Did you just snipe that? I think he just snipped that little thing there.

6267
05:00:19,480 --> 05:00:22,480
I'd like to check out mommy's nature valley.

6268
05:00:22,480 --> 05:00:26,480
I thought a certain type of exercise could give you that kind of control over the muscles.

6269
05:00:26,480 --> 05:00:29,480
Do you guys want to do kegels together?

6270
05:00:29,480 --> 05:00:35,480
And whole, two, three, and release, two, three, and whole, two, three.

6271
05:00:35,480 --> 05:00:39,480
That's terrible. Don't encourage me. Don't get me started.

6272
05:00:39,480 --> 05:00:45,480
Not only will we have, oh my god, I'm trying to take the nature valley out without it crumbling everywhere.

6273
05:00:45,480 --> 05:00:52,480
I have the, I have a Canadian maple syrup flavor at nature valley.

6274
05:00:52,480 --> 05:00:58,480
I got a box that has like three different flavors inside and I just grabbed one because I had to tinkle.

6275
05:00:58,480 --> 05:01:01,480
Whoa, wait, how fast is this one?

6276
05:01:02,480 --> 05:01:07,480
Mmm, it's a ham. Oh, gosh.

6277
05:01:12,480 --> 05:01:15,480
I'm sorry if we got like eating time.

6278
05:01:20,480 --> 05:01:27,480
I'm off to buy groceries, enjoy the shop, try your best to shop local, smile.

6279
05:01:28,480 --> 05:01:33,480
Whoa, that's like respawn so fast. That's 30K every second.

6280
05:01:38,480 --> 05:01:43,480
Mmm, am I going crazy? Why is that spawning so fast?

6281
05:01:43,480 --> 05:01:46,480
Is it like in a van or something?

6282
05:01:46,480 --> 05:01:53,480
Mommy's through it, she doesn't need a lift of 22 million and I'm like, oh my god, is that 30K? That's amazing.

6283
05:01:54,480 --> 05:02:01,480
Mmm, yes, I'm enjoying. Is Gimli still fine? No, she's asleep. I'll just sneak around her.

6284
05:02:04,480 --> 05:02:08,480
What was that? Oh no, it wasn't me that leveled up. I take another big bite.

6285
05:02:08,480 --> 05:02:11,480
Wow. Wow.

6286
05:02:12,480 --> 05:02:15,480
Mmm.

6287
05:02:15,480 --> 05:02:25,480
Bye bye, don't worry if you have to go, this is an endurance stream. I did not expect anyone to sit for 12 hours with me on RuneScape Wall.

6288
05:02:25,480 --> 05:02:27,480
Mmm.

6289
05:02:27,480 --> 05:02:32,480
Someone's dropping them. Why would they do that?

6290
05:02:32,480 --> 05:02:35,480
How rather odd.

6291
05:02:36,480 --> 05:02:41,480
Is he just giving them a week?

6292
05:02:41,480 --> 05:02:44,480
But what if we wanted to?

6293
05:02:44,480 --> 05:02:46,480
Ah, we're not supposed to.

6294
05:02:54,480 --> 05:02:56,480
How bizarre.

6295
05:02:57,480 --> 05:03:05,480
Mmm, no, I think it might be bad for your health to watch me for 12 hours. I'm going to be gone in.

6296
05:03:05,480 --> 05:03:08,480
Mmm, 70.

6297
05:03:08,480 --> 05:03:11,480
Oh my god, we hit 70.

6298
05:03:11,480 --> 05:03:18,480
We're only just over the five hour mark. Can we do 80? Is that too much of a reach?

6299
05:03:18,480 --> 05:03:21,480
To do 80?

6300
05:03:27,480 --> 05:03:32,480
Mmm.

6301
05:03:32,480 --> 05:03:38,480
This shit fucking flaky is anything, man. Nature Valley, count your days.

6302
05:03:38,480 --> 05:03:42,480
That's outrageously crumbly.

6303
05:03:45,480 --> 05:03:50,480
Chat summary shocked you. What does chat summary say?

6304
05:03:57,480 --> 05:04:02,480
What's your favorite snack?

6305
05:04:02,480 --> 05:04:11,480
I don't even know, that's just too many to choose from. Something salty probably. It went from 70 to 76.

6306
05:04:11,480 --> 05:04:16,480
Good 6am morning, never woke up this early.

6307
05:04:16,480 --> 05:04:21,480
Wait, you're up early to watch the stream? Don't do that, get rest, you need rest.

6308
05:04:21,480 --> 05:04:28,480
Wait, where did the time go? Last I looked it was 97 minutes in. No.

6309
05:04:28,480 --> 05:04:35,480
Can you guys see what the chat summary says? Can you post it? Or is it not going to let you post it? Cause I can't see it.

6310
05:04:35,480 --> 05:04:39,480
Cause I'm strumming. I'm strumming my badge.

6311
05:04:40,480 --> 05:04:45,480
Ah.

6312
05:04:48,480 --> 05:04:52,480
I haven't played whole night, is it good?

6313
05:05:00,480 --> 05:05:07,480
Wait, well, that's what the chat... That's what the chat says?

6314
05:05:10,480 --> 05:05:14,480
That's what the chat summary is on my freaking stream?

6315
05:05:14,480 --> 05:05:21,480
Wait, wait, another conspiracy theory, but I did not mention that we want to take them...

6316
05:05:21,480 --> 05:05:25,480
Rockwell. Hold on a minute.

6317
05:05:25,480 --> 05:05:29,480
I went to play Old School RuneSafe, what's a good reason to give it a try?

6318
05:05:29,480 --> 05:05:35,480
Number go up, serotonin, every time number go up, yippee. That's your summary.

6319
05:05:36,480 --> 05:05:41,480
What's your favorite Pokemans? I don't know, there's too many.

6320
05:05:41,480 --> 05:05:44,480
There's too many Pokemans to decide from, and you know that.

6321
05:05:44,480 --> 05:05:49,480
There's literally, isn't there not like over a thousand now? I'm pretty sure.

6322
05:05:53,480 --> 05:05:58,480
Autism game, to be honest. No, is it actually?

6323
05:05:58,480 --> 05:06:02,480
Oh, you know who I like?

6324
05:06:02,480 --> 05:06:07,480
You know who I like, what Pokemon I like, but it sounds like a freaking racist name.

6325
05:06:07,480 --> 05:06:10,480
Sorry, that was so off topic.

6326
05:06:10,480 --> 05:06:20,480
Yeah, so there's this Pokemon called Qing Ling, and it sounds so racist, and I'm like, bruv, it's ridiculous.

6327
05:06:26,480 --> 05:06:30,480
But it's a cute Pokemon, I like the way it looks, it looks really adorable.

6328
05:06:30,480 --> 05:06:33,480
Yeah, the cute little bell one, yeah.

6329
05:06:33,480 --> 05:06:38,480
I just, the name just like, I'm like, I'm not sure how I feel about that.

6330
05:06:38,480 --> 05:06:41,480
17 point name, Burnry. Oh, it has gone down.

6331
05:06:41,480 --> 05:06:45,480
Only Tism Havers here, we only have Tism around these parts.

6332
05:06:45,480 --> 05:06:48,480
We don't have them functioning brains.

6333
05:06:49,480 --> 05:06:52,480
Mm, mm, mm, mm, mm, mm.

6334
05:06:56,480 --> 05:06:59,480
Qing Ling is the sound it makes, what are you saying?

6335
05:07:01,480 --> 05:07:06,480
That sounds like a weird name.

6336
05:07:06,480 --> 05:07:09,480
My favourite Pokemon is Mega Yum.

6337
05:07:09,480 --> 05:07:12,480
I quite like, what's his name?

6338
05:07:13,480 --> 05:07:17,480
Is it Aaron? Aaron?

6339
05:07:17,480 --> 05:07:21,480
The wee Aaron guy, he's so cute and tiny.

6340
05:07:21,480 --> 05:07:25,480
And he eats Aaron, he's so cute.

6341
05:07:25,480 --> 05:07:28,480
You thinking of Penicillin, what?

6342
05:07:28,480 --> 05:07:31,480
Penicillin, Penicillin.

6343
05:07:33,480 --> 05:07:35,480
Absol, Absol?

6344
05:07:36,480 --> 05:07:39,480
Aaron is cutie.

6345
05:07:40,480 --> 05:07:42,480
Where am I getting distracted?

6346
05:07:42,480 --> 05:07:47,480
I'm not, I'm not, I'm not Mega, ugh, I'm not maxing on my swordy fishies.

6347
05:07:47,480 --> 05:07:52,480
I definitely am going to finish all the swordfishes though, which is amazing.

6348
05:07:52,480 --> 05:07:55,480
I'll need to go buy something at the Grand Exchange.

6349
05:07:55,480 --> 05:07:59,480
Sorry, if you heard my stomach rumble, they are illichid and internal fire.

6350
05:07:59,480 --> 05:08:03,480
Those plate bodies are getting suspiciously close to us now.

6351
05:08:03,480 --> 05:08:06,480
What an error, they're getting so close.

6352
05:08:07,480 --> 05:08:10,480
Mine is Nidoran.

6353
05:08:10,480 --> 05:08:12,480
Oh really?

6354
05:08:12,480 --> 05:08:16,480
I remember when Pokemon Go came out, I was really digging it.

6355
05:08:19,480 --> 05:08:21,480
Look at the bunny's dancing.

6356
05:08:21,480 --> 05:08:25,480
Oh, they're doing like a perfect, you know, I can't remember what it's called,

6357
05:08:25,480 --> 05:08:29,480
but that's like English culture when you stand around a pole and all dance around it.

6358
05:08:29,480 --> 05:08:32,480
That sounded like another type of dance,

6359
05:08:32,480 --> 05:08:37,480
but no, it's like actually English culture, like back in the old days type thing.

6360
05:08:39,480 --> 05:08:42,480
Why are we on the same wavelength again?

6361
05:08:42,480 --> 05:08:44,480
God damn it, streamer.

6362
05:08:45,480 --> 05:08:47,480
I'm just trying to, you can't keep doing this,

6363
05:08:47,480 --> 05:08:50,480
you can't keep saying everything that I'm thinking.

6364
05:08:53,480 --> 05:08:55,480
Gardevoir, Hypno-R.

6365
05:08:55,480 --> 05:08:58,480
I do, I've always enjoyed Gardevoir thoroughly.

6366
05:08:58,480 --> 05:09:00,480
Enjoyed Gardevoir.

6367
05:09:00,480 --> 05:09:04,480
Very cool, unique and different design.

6368
05:09:04,480 --> 05:09:07,480
Color scheme as well, very unique.

6369
05:09:07,480 --> 05:09:10,480
God damn it, how many plate bodies does this person got?

6370
05:09:12,480 --> 05:09:16,480
Oh my god, wait, everyone's like walking towards the, as well.

6371
05:09:19,480 --> 05:09:21,480
What, how much was that, 3 million?

6372
05:09:22,480 --> 05:09:24,480
Is this a refling doing this?

6373
05:09:24,480 --> 05:09:26,480
Am I going crazy?

6374
05:09:27,480 --> 05:09:29,480
What's plate body 4 for defense?

6375
05:09:29,480 --> 05:09:31,480
They are free.

6376
05:09:32,480 --> 05:09:35,480
But why give it away for free, didn't you know?

6377
05:09:35,480 --> 05:09:37,480
Are you squinting me right now?

6378
05:09:37,480 --> 05:09:38,480
What?

6379
05:09:43,480 --> 05:09:45,480
Thank you, boy, for the tip.

6380
05:09:45,480 --> 05:09:47,480
Wait, we can't both be holding at the same time.

6381
05:09:48,480 --> 05:09:51,480
Well, my hands are relatively small.

6382
05:09:52,480 --> 05:09:54,480
Thank you for the tip.

6383
05:09:56,480 --> 05:09:59,480
You probably like her art too, huh?

6384
05:09:59,480 --> 05:10:01,480
Yeah, what are you going to do about it?

6385
05:10:01,480 --> 05:10:02,480
One look.

6386
05:10:02,480 --> 05:10:04,480
Sorry, I only mow my hands.

6387
05:10:04,480 --> 05:10:06,480
Two hands is fine.

6388
05:10:06,480 --> 05:10:08,480
He keeps answering you strongly, but yeah, it's a refling.

6389
05:10:08,480 --> 05:10:09,480
Okay.

6390
05:10:11,480 --> 05:10:14,480
I think he's trying to give you a nice valuable thing.

6391
05:10:14,480 --> 05:10:15,480
It wasn't me.

6392
05:10:15,480 --> 05:10:17,480
Oh wait, am I supposed to chase after it?

6393
05:10:17,480 --> 05:10:20,480
I'm so sorry, refling, if I'm supposed to chase after it.

6394
05:10:20,480 --> 05:10:22,480
Oh my god, streamer distracted.

6395
05:10:22,480 --> 05:10:24,480
I'm so dumb, I'm a streamer.

6396
05:10:24,480 --> 05:10:26,480
I'm just a streamer.

6397
05:10:26,480 --> 05:10:30,480
I stream my life away.

6398
05:10:32,480 --> 05:10:33,480
Away.

6399
05:10:35,480 --> 05:10:37,480
I'm just a refling.

6400
05:10:37,480 --> 05:10:42,480
I stream snipe my life away.

6401
05:10:44,480 --> 05:10:45,480
Away.

6402
05:10:47,480 --> 05:10:49,480
68, 16 points.

6403
05:10:49,480 --> 05:10:50,480
Oh, the burn rate went up.

6404
05:10:50,480 --> 05:10:51,480
I got a little too excited there.

6405
05:10:51,480 --> 05:10:52,480
Hold on a minute.

6406
05:10:52,480 --> 05:10:54,480
I think it's because it's reset.

6407
05:10:54,480 --> 05:10:57,480
The burn rate will kind of go up until...

6408
05:10:57,480 --> 05:10:59,480
M.E.B. so you're under arrest?

6409
05:10:59,480 --> 05:11:01,480
That guy said it at the NPC says.

6410
05:11:01,480 --> 05:11:03,480
I'm focused on the grind.

6411
05:11:03,480 --> 05:11:05,480
You don't want me a grind?

6412
05:11:05,480 --> 05:11:07,480
Come on, mate, come on, mate.

6413
05:11:10,480 --> 05:11:12,480
Why would M.E.B. under arrest?

6414
05:11:12,480 --> 05:11:14,480
There should be pin pals under arrest.

6415
05:11:23,480 --> 05:11:27,480
I'm not really enjoying this bar anymore.

6416
05:11:27,480 --> 05:11:30,480
Rather flavorless, isn't it, bro?

6417
05:11:31,480 --> 05:11:34,480
I'm tempted to order takeaway, I'm going to be honest.

6418
05:11:34,480 --> 05:11:35,480
I'm like...

6419
05:11:35,480 --> 05:11:37,480
I'm doing an insurance stream.

6420
05:11:37,480 --> 05:11:39,480
I deserve a cheeky takeaway.

6421
05:11:39,480 --> 05:11:41,480
I'm such a good girl.

6422
05:11:41,480 --> 05:11:43,480
Why should I not get cheeky takeaway?

6423
05:11:44,480 --> 05:11:46,480
Pizza, nah.

6424
05:11:46,480 --> 05:11:48,480
Not pizza.

6425
05:11:48,480 --> 05:11:51,480
Australian pizza, I'm sorry, Australia.

6426
05:11:51,480 --> 05:11:53,480
And any Australian Muslim?

6427
05:11:53,480 --> 05:11:55,480
Australian pizza is...

6428
05:11:55,480 --> 05:11:56,480
No, thank you.

6429
05:11:56,480 --> 05:11:58,480
I've not had one pizza I've enjoyed here.

6430
05:11:58,480 --> 05:12:00,480
It's just full of grease.

6431
05:12:00,480 --> 05:12:03,480
The grease is dripping off the thing.

6432
05:12:03,480 --> 05:12:07,480
They could have blotted it or patted it or whatever, but they don't.

6433
05:12:10,480 --> 05:12:12,480
Cheeky little treat, perhaps.

6434
05:12:12,480 --> 05:12:16,480
I'm bringing you all with me as I buy a pizza before a storm hits.

6435
05:12:16,480 --> 05:12:18,480
Oh, you're actually getting a pizza in real life.

6436
05:12:22,480 --> 05:12:24,480
Didn't Emmy burn down buildings?

6437
05:12:24,480 --> 05:12:29,480
Look, Emmy needs XP in order to summon her brother back.

6438
05:12:29,480 --> 05:12:32,480
It's, look, whatever she does, as long as we can look the other way.

6439
05:12:32,480 --> 05:12:36,480
The fact she's not, actually, now that I mention it, the fact she's not even in jail.

6440
05:12:36,480 --> 05:12:42,480
How would she be evading jail when she just uses her magic on people who try and stop her?

6441
05:12:42,480 --> 05:12:45,480
Or maybe she has, like, influential magic.

6442
05:12:45,480 --> 05:12:49,480
I wouldn't be surprised if she had, like, turned the other eye type of spells.

6443
05:12:50,480 --> 05:12:53,480
Where it was like, oh, must have been the wind.

6444
05:12:53,480 --> 05:12:57,480
I wouldn't be surprised if she had access to that.

6445
05:12:57,480 --> 05:12:59,480
And her wee totems.

6446
05:13:02,480 --> 05:13:04,480
High charisma, yeah.

6447
05:13:06,480 --> 05:13:10,480
She has to rescue Nissan from the devil herself.

6448
05:13:10,480 --> 05:13:12,480
Like, Maggie Thatcher?

6449
05:13:12,480 --> 05:13:14,480
I think people were so confused.

6450
05:13:14,480 --> 05:13:18,480
They were like, why'd the devil herself, and then Maggie Thatcher?

6451
05:13:18,480 --> 05:13:20,480
And it was a surprise.

6452
05:13:20,480 --> 05:13:24,480
There was a Scottish person on the development team, and we thought the gag was hilarious.

6453
05:13:24,480 --> 05:13:26,480
So, there you go.

6454
05:13:30,480 --> 05:13:34,480
I drink a wee bit of cola, and then we're gonna get on my honey tea.

6455
05:13:35,480 --> 05:13:37,480
Any honey tears?

6456
05:13:37,480 --> 05:13:40,480
Me, me, I'm honey tea.

6457
05:13:41,480 --> 05:13:46,480
And we can just be a peeler on them, and...

6458
05:13:46,480 --> 05:13:48,480
Okay, they can't do anything.

6459
05:13:48,480 --> 05:13:49,480
I cracked up.

6460
05:13:49,480 --> 05:13:51,480
Wait, what was my joke?

6461
05:13:53,480 --> 05:13:56,480
Wait, what joke did I just say? Hold on.

6462
05:13:57,480 --> 05:14:00,480
Wait, what did I say? That was funny. Go again.

6463
05:14:00,480 --> 05:14:03,480
Go again, tell me, remain me. I'm ready for going.

6464
05:14:04,480 --> 05:14:09,480
Oh, the Maggie Thatcher.

6465
05:14:09,480 --> 05:14:13,480
Alright, sorry, I thought it was a pun. I'm not gonna lie, I had my fingers ready to do that.

6466
05:14:13,480 --> 05:14:15,480
Okay, my apologies.

6467
05:14:15,480 --> 05:14:19,480
I thought I made a pun, and I was like, what did I make? That was funny.

6468
05:14:19,480 --> 05:14:21,480
I forgot.

6469
05:14:22,480 --> 05:14:23,480
Okay.

6470
05:14:24,480 --> 05:14:29,480
Chewing fish and chips for my...

6471
05:14:31,480 --> 05:14:33,480
I...

6472
05:14:34,480 --> 05:14:38,480
So, do you want to hear the saddest story in all the land?

6473
05:14:38,480 --> 05:14:41,480
I really like Mexican food.

6474
05:14:41,480 --> 05:14:43,480
You know what I don't like?

6475
05:14:43,480 --> 05:14:44,480
cilantro.

6476
05:14:44,480 --> 05:14:46,480
And that stuff tastes awful.

6477
05:14:46,480 --> 05:14:52,480
Do you want to know what cilantro is primarily used in?

6478
05:14:53,480 --> 05:14:56,480
That's right, Mexican cooking.

6479
05:14:57,480 --> 05:15:00,480
Man, I hated you.

6480
05:15:01,480 --> 05:15:05,480
It tastes awful to me. Absolutely awful.

6481
05:15:05,480 --> 05:15:07,480
I tried a...

6482
05:15:07,480 --> 05:15:09,480
I tried a rice wrap.

6483
05:15:09,480 --> 05:15:13,480
I think it was Vietnamese inspired rice wrap.

6484
05:15:13,480 --> 05:15:17,480
No, rice cake wrap with chicken in it and all that.

6485
05:15:17,480 --> 05:15:20,480
And it sounded so good and I took a bite and I was like...

6486
05:15:21,480 --> 05:15:28,480
In Australia, there's a lot more access to Asian foods

6487
05:15:28,480 --> 05:15:31,480
that are authentic or really good type thing,

6488
05:15:31,480 --> 05:15:34,480
which is why I'm currently addicted to local Chinese.

6489
05:15:38,480 --> 05:15:40,480
And so, I've been adventurous.

6490
05:15:40,480 --> 05:15:42,480
I've been like, oh, I'll try this, I'll try that.

6491
05:15:43,480 --> 05:15:48,480
And I couldn't figure out why I hated it until I finally figured out it's cilantro.

6492
05:15:48,480 --> 05:15:51,480
I can't handle cilantro. It tastes nasty.

6493
05:15:51,480 --> 05:15:53,480
I'm so sorry.

6494
05:15:53,480 --> 05:15:58,480
I apologize to those who do enjoy cilantro.

6495
05:15:58,480 --> 05:16:00,480
Yes, I have the soap gene.

6496
05:16:00,480 --> 05:16:05,480
I cannot even describe to you how nasty and completely ruins

6497
05:16:05,480 --> 05:16:09,480
and any trace of it in the food completely ruins the food as well.

6498
05:16:09,480 --> 05:16:14,480
It is an unlucky and unfun gene to have.

6499
05:16:14,480 --> 05:16:17,480
Isn't it genetic?

6500
05:16:17,480 --> 05:16:19,480
I don't know if it's genetic.

6501
05:16:19,480 --> 05:16:23,480
My dad, I think, eats it fine.

6502
05:16:23,480 --> 05:16:28,480
Because one time he made, like, is it Pico de Mayo or something?

6503
05:16:28,480 --> 05:16:31,480
I'm so sorry. I think I butchered that.

6504
05:16:31,480 --> 05:16:34,480
He made it and I tasted it and I was like, this is nasty.

6505
05:16:34,480 --> 05:16:35,480
But I never said that to him.

6506
05:16:35,480 --> 05:16:38,480
I just said, oh, I don't think my taste buds agree with that,

6507
05:16:38,480 --> 05:16:41,480
but he never said anything because of the cilantro in it.

6508
05:16:41,480 --> 05:16:43,480
Pico de gallo.

6509
05:16:43,480 --> 05:16:45,480
Okay, sorry.

6510
05:16:46,480 --> 05:16:48,480
Pico de gallo.

6511
05:16:48,480 --> 05:16:51,480
Yes, I think my dad tried to make some of it at home.

6512
05:16:51,480 --> 05:16:55,480
And, yeah, I was like, hmm, nope.

6513
05:17:01,480 --> 05:17:03,480
I better buckle up in Pico.

6514
05:17:03,480 --> 05:17:05,480
No, buckle up in Pico.

6515
05:17:05,480 --> 05:17:10,480
I've had my fair share of absolutely horrific things I've consumed.

6516
05:17:12,480 --> 05:17:14,480
Where's the yellow thing?

6517
05:17:14,480 --> 05:17:16,480
Oh, that reminds me of it.

6518
05:17:16,480 --> 05:17:19,480
We need to do a watch along of Kevin Bridges.

6519
05:17:22,480 --> 05:17:24,480
Kevin Bridges is a Scottish comedian.

6520
05:17:24,480 --> 05:17:26,480
You might know someone called Frankie Boyle

6521
05:17:26,480 --> 05:17:29,480
or what's the other Scottish comedian's name

6522
05:17:29,480 --> 05:17:32,480
and I've forgotten his name and he's got Parkinson's right now,

6523
05:17:32,480 --> 05:17:35,480
but he's still alive, I'm pretty sure.

6524
05:17:36,480 --> 05:17:40,480
And he's got a beard and kind of big,

6525
05:17:40,480 --> 05:17:43,480
not curly hair, but wavy hair.

6526
05:17:43,480 --> 05:17:46,480
And he's older, oh my God, what's his name?

6527
05:17:49,480 --> 05:17:51,480
Billy Conley, oh.

6528
05:17:51,480 --> 05:17:53,480
Billy Conley.

6529
05:17:53,480 --> 05:17:55,480
It took me so long to get there, holy crap.

6530
05:17:55,480 --> 05:17:56,480
Billy Conley.

6531
05:17:56,480 --> 05:17:59,480
Hold on, I need to drink my tea before I get sick.

6532
05:18:05,480 --> 05:18:07,480
So I put far too much honey in my first team

6533
05:18:07,480 --> 05:18:09,480
and I put far too much little.

6534
05:18:09,480 --> 05:18:11,480
I can never find the balance.

6535
05:18:11,480 --> 05:18:14,480
Billy Conley is like real Scots.

6536
05:18:14,480 --> 05:18:17,480
I'm going to do watch alongs of like,

6537
05:18:17,480 --> 05:18:19,480
Scottish comedy so you guys can laugh

6538
05:18:19,480 --> 05:18:21,480
and I can be like,

6539
05:18:21,480 --> 05:18:24,480
why are the reeflings running in an X pattern?

6540
05:18:24,480 --> 05:18:27,480
So they are assigned each other to follow each other

6541
05:18:27,480 --> 05:18:29,480
which is causing this four way.

6542
05:18:29,480 --> 05:18:32,480
Oh my God, what are you doing over there?

6543
05:18:35,480 --> 05:18:37,480
So they're not actually clicking anymore.

6544
05:18:37,480 --> 05:18:39,480
Their characters are following each other

6545
05:18:39,480 --> 05:18:41,480
which is causing an infinite loop.

6546
05:18:41,480 --> 05:18:43,480
Which is pretty cool.

6547
05:18:45,480 --> 05:18:48,480
Wait, you don't pronounce the second Billy Conley?

6548
05:18:48,480 --> 05:18:50,480
Oh, Billy Conley, sorry.

6549
05:18:50,480 --> 05:18:52,480
Billy Conley.

6550
05:18:52,480 --> 05:18:54,480
I'm not good with names so don't expect any,

6551
05:18:54,480 --> 05:18:57,480
don't expect a miracle with me, okay?

6552
05:18:57,480 --> 05:18:59,480
It's a strong summoning ritual.

6553
05:18:59,480 --> 05:19:02,480
Down with black rock.

6554
05:19:05,480 --> 05:19:06,480
I love Kevin Bridges,

6555
05:19:06,480 --> 05:19:08,480
my brother served him at a local club.

6556
05:19:08,480 --> 05:19:10,480
Oh, that's amazing.

6557
05:19:10,480 --> 05:19:13,480
I really enjoy Kevin Bridges' humour

6558
05:19:13,480 --> 05:19:15,480
because it's quite deadpan.

6559
05:19:15,480 --> 05:19:18,480
British humour is quite deadpan

6560
05:19:18,480 --> 05:19:20,480
so we'll probably do a watch.

6561
05:19:20,480 --> 05:19:22,480
Again, sturdy with it.

6562
05:19:22,480 --> 05:19:26,480
Hold on, let me just get the fish out of the bank first.

6563
05:19:26,480 --> 05:19:28,480
Reefing getting sturdy with it.

6564
05:19:28,480 --> 05:19:34,480
Ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, hiddah hiddah hiddah hiddah hiddah hiddah hiddah.

6565
05:19:34,480 --> 05:19:36,480
I love all these emotes in the game.

6566
05:19:36,480 --> 05:19:40,480
I haven't unlocked any more but other than the default ones.

6567
05:19:40,480 --> 05:19:42,480
Hmm.

6568
05:19:42,480 --> 05:19:46,480
This stomped-on Rottra really sells me on the cult vibes.

6569
05:19:46,480 --> 05:19:50,480
Aw, she be playing cult of the Lamb, did she finish it yet?

6570
05:19:50,480 --> 05:19:53,480
I think she was so close to finishing it at last I knew

6571
05:19:53,480 --> 05:19:56,480
but maybe she did it.

6572
05:19:56,480 --> 05:19:58,480
Ehm

6573
05:19:59,660 --> 05:20:01,660
Hydration

6574
05:20:03,280 --> 05:20:08,260
Gears are quid, oh you're getting stabbed. It's a great one. It is. Oh my god and

6575
05:20:09,560 --> 05:20:15,780
Oi fat boy right? I know this makes no I'm gonna. I'm gonna tell Kevin Bridges is joke, okay?

6576
05:20:16,280 --> 05:20:22,220
So Kevin Bridges is a man, and he's quite large in size. I think he'd lost the weight since or whatever

6577
05:20:22,220 --> 05:20:28,580
but he said he was like 25 stone or something which is big and he was telling

6578
05:20:28,580 --> 05:20:34,100
the story where he's out late at night waiting on the bus and some net comes up

6579
05:20:34,100 --> 05:20:40,340
and goes oh fat boy Gia's a quid or you're getting stabbed and then he's

6580
05:20:40,340 --> 05:20:44,980
like I saw I start calculating my BMI with the other people around me type

6581
05:20:44,980 --> 05:20:49,940
thing and then he ascertains that it's him that's been picked on by this

6582
05:20:49,940 --> 05:20:58,900
person and he's like in order to avoid this heinous act against me for the

6583
05:20:58,900 --> 05:21:04,900
mere price of a quid and I think that's a pretty good bargain and so he did not

6584
05:21:04,900 --> 05:21:09,020
get stabbed that night that's the best I can do for telling the joke but it's a

6585
05:21:09,020 --> 05:21:14,380
really good joke I'll get us to do a watch along Kevin Bridges call the

6586
05:21:14,380 --> 05:21:17,780
lambs getting local co-op I know I'm gonna play it with sheebie and we'll force

6587
05:21:17,780 --> 05:21:24,020
her to play with me and he used to weigh about 350 pounds

6588
05:21:24,020 --> 05:21:31,380
there's an American place that lets you eat for free and if you're over like

6589
05:21:31,380 --> 05:21:35,860
heart attack grill oh my god I'm so sorry I look at videos a heart attack grill

6590
05:21:35,860 --> 05:21:42,780
I think it's so fascinating and there's like a way outside the restaurant and if

6591
05:21:42,780 --> 05:21:50,020
you are over that weight you get to eat for free I'm like wow 25 stone equal to

6594
05:22:06,540 --> 05:22:14,580
level I can cook those octopuses but I think we'll go to the grand exchange and

6595
05:22:14,580 --> 05:22:22,980
buy some I have a terrible feeling they are a membership only item so we might

6596
05:22:22,980 --> 05:22:26,260
have to swap to a membership world which is a shame for anyone who's not a

6597
05:22:26,260 --> 05:22:30,020
member the heart attack griffin

6598
05:22:30,020 --> 05:22:37,300
mm isn't heart attack girl just a place because the owner hates fat people and

6599
05:22:37,300 --> 05:22:43,520
wants them to do what is that the lore or

6612
05:24:14,900 --> 05:24:22,780

6613
05:24:22,780 --> 05:24:28,500
actually just a British government and starving the people and a lot of Irish

05:33:46,500 --> 05:33:49,420
into that at the same time it's possible that they're gonna have a slight

6696
05:33:49,420 --> 05:33:56,140
change to some items and all that jazz the DLC does come out in November which

6697
05:33:56,180 --> 05:33:59,700
means we can all play multiplayer together and I'm going to go crazy

6698
05:33:59,700 --> 05:34:07,980
you literally you're gonna be sick of it but I think it would be really empty

6699
05:34:07,980 --> 05:34:14,940
sack it would be really good to get dead God together I think that would be

6700
05:34:14,940 --> 05:34:18,900
crazy because I would make it so much easier of all through like the max

6701
05:34:18,900 --> 05:34:24,780
lobby size is four so three reeflings at a time can do a run with me and I'll

6702
05:34:24,820 --> 05:34:27,780
just do it the way we did with Elden Ring where I write down your name and

6703
05:34:27,780 --> 05:34:33,860

6706
05:34:47,060 --> 05:34:53,460

6707
05:34:53,500 --> 05:35:00,020
items oh no I just do whatever I want I have never actually it took me so long

05:38:23,780 --> 05:38:27,820
I don't know what planning is I've never done it or been in one before I just

6739
05:38:58,300 --> 05:39:02,220
thousand gold I sure you did absolutely nothing with it because I abandoned

6740
05:39:02,220 --> 05:39:15,300
they can't probably never bothered again price trout trout is 41 raw trout

6741
05:39:15,300 --> 05:39:25,020
190 for a raw trout quick sailing for like 189 hmm did we actually one goes

6743
05:39:32,540 --> 05:39:35,700

05:39:56,800 --> 05:40:03,120
gonna end on if we do I think someone said it was like five endurance streams

6747
05:40:03,120 --> 05:40:12,480

05:40:12,480 --> 05:40:16,840
messed up oh no it's gonna form in don't form in don't form in don't form in

6749
05:40:16,840 --> 05:40:23,720
don't form in don't firm in you see honestly it's less about being efficient

6750
05:40:23,720 --> 05:40:30,040
and more about saving our hands so you guys don't have to stoke the fire for me

6751
05:40:30,040 --> 05:40:32,480
all the time

6752
05:40:33,200 --> 05:40:35,720

6756
05:40:58,520 --> 05:41:04,840
6,000 wines though I could only do 14 pair inventory slot which is a bit of a

6757
05:41:04,840 --> 05:41:15,120
problem so I need like just what 14 how many 14's does it take to get to 100 I

6758
05:41:15,120 --> 05:41:24,800
don't know but I'm gonna be here for a while I think or is it six no 14 my

6764
05:42:05,600 --> 05:42:10,920
seven inventories to do a hundred that's quite a lot

6765
05:42:11,600 --> 05:42:23,560
what I've messed up but that's okay I'm trying my best you need roughly so 62k

6775
05:43:21,960 --> 05:43:30,000
in like oh no this is a lot and the next time we do runescape stream we are

6776
05:43:30,040 --> 05:43:33,360
gonna be watching a movie series so I don't have to talk and I can rest my

6777
05:43:33,360 --> 05:43:36,560
voice a little bit because I do have quite a few ASMR clubs coming up and I

6778
05:43:36,560 --> 05:43:43,120
need to keep my voice steady need my voice to be steady and ready wines are

6779
05:43:43,120 --> 05:43:56,440
like 480k if you're consistent per hour I mean it's alright you need 87k sword

6780
05:43:56,480 --> 05:44:07,000
fish so waitings are still faster in the end oh my gosh oh we flins I think I'm

6781
05:44:07,000 --> 05:44:12,200
gonna messed up picking cooking but I really want 99 I've never had my first

6782
05:44:12,200 --> 05:44:20,520
99 before I'm getting nervous I'm gonna shake you just drink back what's with a

6783
05:44:20,520 --> 05:44:24,000
ritual dance at the top of the screen those are reeflings they're just dancing

6784
05:44:24,000 --> 05:44:30,440
each other we're all hanging out of the fire remember level 92 is halfway stop

6785
05:44:30,440 --> 05:44:44,520
is it actually no I will not give myself that I'll see what happens after the

6786
05:44:44,520 --> 05:44:53,120
movie marathon xp wise it's halfway I know what happened to the legendary

6787
05:44:53,120 --> 05:44:58,680
stamina I'm getting nervous I don't know if I have an end in stamina now I'm

6788
05:44:58,680 --> 05:45:03,480
getting shaking way right empty boom boom

6789
05:45:03,480 --> 05:45:10,000
boy fat boom boom cooking is the fastest without completely rune like cooking

6790
05:45:10,000 --> 05:45:19,160
fish isn't it good that we'll be there with it yeah next runescape stream though

6791
05:45:19,160 --> 05:45:23,840
I'm gonna be watching movies so I'm not talking too much because my voice is

6792
05:45:23,840 --> 05:45:30,880
getting shredded but I love it can't help can't stop talking okay

6793
05:45:31,440 --> 05:45:39,160
well making wines is faster with the reeflings here 99 shouldn't be a problem

6794
05:45:39,160 --> 05:45:48,480
okay okay okay although it'd be really cool to look back and see how much time

6795
05:45:48,480 --> 05:45:55,200
I spent I wouldn't mind doing some questing after we get 99 cooking I don't

6796
05:45:55,200 --> 05:46:00,480
know if I'm gonna be able to do 99 cooking in one month though because of

6797
05:46:00,480 --> 05:46:05,200
the streams that I've got planned out it doesn't really work that well because of

6798
05:46:05,200 --> 05:46:14,760
Elden Ring because of Elden Ring I would have been able to put more time into

6799
05:46:14,760 --> 05:46:20,160
Rinscape but because of Elden Ring 99 cooking that's all because of a mediocre

6800
05:46:20,160 --> 05:46:26,920
joke that you're a whammin you got this Johnny we'll make you and we'll get

6801
05:46:26,920 --> 05:46:34,720
your master chef but it would be kind of cool to look back at like this the

6802
05:46:34,720 --> 05:46:40,480
stream thumbnails and see how much time it took obviously we did some questing

6803
05:46:40,480 --> 05:46:43,840
the first I had so much fun like doing all those quests and like waiting for

6804
05:46:43,840 --> 05:46:48,800
everyone and be like okay we'll do this next we'll do this night and so if I do

6805
05:46:48,800 --> 05:46:54,680
achieve 99 cooking and I'm not burnt out of RuneScape then pardon me I'm burping

6806
05:46:54,680 --> 05:47:03,240
away here I actually wouldn't mind and I wouldn't mind what I wouldn't mind doing

6807
05:47:03,240 --> 05:47:06,080
some more quests than again together because that's quite fun and it's more

6808
05:47:06,080 --> 05:47:12,760
interactive than literally you do need to do a quest to cook a koambas I can

6809
05:47:12,760 --> 05:47:17,480
never say I don't know what on earth I'm supposed to pronounce them as and are

6810
05:47:17,480 --> 05:47:26,640
they better XP than wine is the question that need combat for that quest by

6811
05:47:26,640 --> 05:47:37,600
any chance 50 subs away from 60 stop is that video still getting traction yeah

6812
05:47:38,600 --> 05:47:50,600
sticking at my yet for the river only by tick manipulating right no if wait so

6813
05:47:50,600 --> 05:47:58,560
I'm just doing wines for the rest of this entire gig oh no it's only faster if

6814
05:47:58,560 --> 05:48:04,120
you're paying attention I'm just doing wings for the rest oh this is terrible

6815
05:48:04,120 --> 05:48:11,080
stream content you guys just seem to go back and forth to make more wines wait

6816
05:48:11,080 --> 05:48:16,800
so then why was that chick doing lobsters we're the one with a big jibblies out

6817
05:48:16,800 --> 05:48:22,480
why did she do lobsters for cooking is lobsters cheaper cheaper can always

6818
05:48:22,480 --> 05:48:27,880
switch it up yeah I'll maybe finish my swordfish once this batch for minutes

6819
05:48:27,880 --> 05:48:32,600
I'll swap back to the swordfish just so like everything the reflins gave me and

6820
05:48:32,600 --> 05:48:37,560
being used up that seems like the wisest thing it's come oh yeah you're like

6821
05:48:37,560 --> 05:48:46,240
when I yeah for you oh yeah pull over your face your stomach your thighs fish

6822
05:48:46,240 --> 05:48:52,320
would be we floor but we less attention yeah I'm the Wayne attention batch is

6823
05:48:52,320 --> 05:48:56,440
getting pretty rough I know I can I'm sorry I'm touching my boob right now I'm

6824
05:48:56,760 --> 05:49:01,800
I'm not even pretending otherwise I've only got one hand available right now

6825
05:49:01,800 --> 05:49:10,680
tea you can literally just talk to us for the content that's why I'm here

6826
05:49:15,800 --> 05:49:23,760
no right I think we can finish off the swordfish and the Wayne also it was

6827
05:49:23,760 --> 05:49:26,680
actually really funny that you just straight up handed me like your wine

6828
05:49:26,680 --> 05:49:30,440
collection no questions you know like no this is mine you're just like I hear

6829
05:49:30,440 --> 05:49:35,560
habits Tony it's quite funny actually don't think about it yeah there's no

6830
05:49:35,560 --> 05:49:39,080
point in arguing she can have it

6831
05:49:39,080 --> 05:50:01,920
why you did it rank wow oh that's so big oh you can get it oh sorry I'm

6832
05:50:01,920 --> 05:50:06,520
getting distracted why don't ferment I got distracted I was reading don't ferment

6833
05:50:06,520 --> 05:50:14,520
you're yapping is so strong we forgot that you were also playing runescape the

6834
05:50:14,520 --> 05:50:18,720
game is more a background to you honestly we first try to get more

6835
05:50:18,720 --> 05:50:25,400
mad rope with all this wine exactly forfeit all mortal positions to the

6836
05:50:25,400 --> 05:50:31,520
cauliflower no look after yourself get yourself a debt buy yourself treatees at

6837
05:50:31,520 --> 05:50:40,560
the corner shop and then and only then the fermentation is top left oh wow

6838
05:50:40,560 --> 05:50:51,080
that's so cool man rune rune light plug-in is so good we're learning

6839
05:50:52,080 --> 05:50:55,720
what what

198 key 198 key seriously whoops that was good though that was really good okay

6881

maybe wines is the way to go because a big if true and I'm not even finished

6882
05:55:43,980 --> 05:55:47,820
fermenting all the wine that I've got hold on I'm gonna put the heating on

6883
05:55:47,820 --> 05:56:03,780
cuz I'm absolutely frozen it's 15 degrees am I supposed to survive in

6884
05:56:04,780 --> 05:56:20,600
yeah apparently I'm Australian I rent and but okay I just I just popped the

6885
05:56:20,600 --> 05:56:24,880
last into the 73 I would have jumped three levels if I managed to do one more

6886
05:56:24,880 --> 05:56:30,300
batch right hold on let's see what's going on with my Azure delay she is coming

6887
05:56:30,300 --> 05:56:39,820
up oh my god as it were please spell correctly there she is there she is oh

6888
05:56:39,820 --> 05:56:45,540
literally in T-minus two minutes and Azura is playing a absolutely precious

6889
05:56:45,540 --> 05:56:51,660
game called stray I have not yet had the pleasure to play it but it's bloody

6890
05:56:51,660 --> 05:57:00,500
good yeah yeah if you've made the 1,000 winds it would have been a two hundred

6891
05:57:00,500 --> 05:57:04,860
keep on listen to strong you yeah well at work and proof product to me I feel

6892
05:57:04,860 --> 05:57:17,020
like and I feel like I would distract being like at work and stuff honestly

6893
05:57:17,900 --> 05:57:22,860
if I had an office I feel like I'd be like one of them bosses that couldn't

6894
05:57:22,860 --> 05:57:28,100
just give a rat's ass like as long as you do the work go home early doesn't

6895
05:57:28,100 --> 05:57:34,180
bother me none seems like whenever someone gets a manager type job they

6896
05:57:34,180 --> 05:57:37,580
think they call the shots and it was like no you're at the mercy of your

6897
05:57:37,580 --> 05:57:44,900
workers let's let's not get it twisted let's not get it twisted are you doing

6898
05:57:44,940 --> 05:57:49,260
marshmallow later yeah of course I'll do marshmallow more than happy to I would

6899
05:57:49,260 --> 05:57:53,740
I'll do it when we do when we go back to the fish because unfortunately the

6900
05:57:53,740 --> 05:58:02,700
winds require a lot more and like fast clicking every time I move to the left

6901
05:58:02,700 --> 05:58:10,780
I need to do and I'm getting nervous now not to be a minger but when I tried to

6902
05:58:10,780 --> 05:58:15,540
go to toilet but nothing came out and I'm worried I'm gonna have to go toilet

6903
05:58:15,540 --> 05:58:22,300
in the middle of the stream but I don't want to go toilet I normally take a

6904
05:58:22,300 --> 05:58:34,500
shower after I fell off my most thought what time come in here oops I will do

6905
05:58:34,500 --> 05:58:40,220
marshmallow it's not problem use your gamer bucket please do not ever type

6906
05:58:40,220 --> 05:58:48,420
again gamer bucket now pee bottles I can tolerate gamer bucket like Eric

6907
05:58:48,420 --> 05:58:57,700
Cartman style ma'am ma'am I need to use the bathroom ma'am you gotta go for a

6908
05:58:57,700 --> 05:59:04,180
job eh the birthday girl my team leader in quality assurance didn't sell their

6909
05:59:04,180 --> 05:59:08,180
their premiums since months because the workers are more made and didn't get

6910
05:59:08,180 --> 05:59:14,780
trained properly literally just because you in the manager position does not

6911
05:59:14,780 --> 05:59:17,820
make you a leader

6912
05:59:17,820 --> 05:59:34,340
magi playing runescape into 24 without a refunds you know the gamer bucket

6913
05:59:34,340 --> 05:59:44,780
yes yes on a scale of 1 to 10 how jealous are you of men's ability to use

6914
05:59:44,780 --> 05:59:56,900
gamer ball I I don't think it applies to me because I have acidic like main

6915
05:59:56,900 --> 06:00:03,980
stinks actually I probably should have mentioned that to the doctor he forgot to

6916
06:00:03,980 --> 06:00:07,740
mention it what was that also if you try to do a last night name fletching your

6917
06:00:07,740 --> 06:00:12,020
wrist would die after a few minutes unless you learned mostly I don't have

6918
06:00:12,020 --> 06:00:19,980
that kind of mouse I have up and down on the mouse that's it good dinner ruined

6919
06:00:19,980 --> 06:00:29,980
sorry okay I think we're gonna have to swap back to the sort the swordfish just

6920
06:00:29,980 --> 06:00:35,980
for a little bit because this is like one after the other your mace your face

6921
06:00:35,980 --> 06:00:48,700
melts off kind of acid yeah mouse keys are button presses oh I don't have that

6922
06:00:49,140 --> 06:00:53,620
that's it how about we just bought the levels and I'll just commentate over oh

6923
06:00:53,620 --> 06:00:59,680
my god you leveled up congrats I'm kidding by the way we're not born I don't

6924
06:00:59,680 --> 06:01:03,420
know how bad the box are in runescape I heard they're really bad in World of

6925
06:01:03,420 --> 06:01:15,260
Warcraft but bots apparently keep prices low and cheeky runescape so gamer girl

6926
06:01:15,260 --> 06:01:21,260
uses P-Bollies more long I'm already in trouble by YouTube actually should check

6927
06:01:21,260 --> 06:01:27,780
out wait no I'll check it when we're doing the fish not well this is being in

6928
06:01:27,780 --> 06:01:47,220
the way I will check it after I've done this batch of wines which I just know

6929
06:01:47,220 --> 06:01:50,340
some people say like oh the reason why the box are actually good is because they

6930
06:01:50,340 --> 06:01:54,540
keep everything low price because they're like trying to fight over the same

6931
06:01:54,580 --> 06:02:00,380
resources type thing and I was like honestly that is actually valid

6932
06:02:00,380 --> 06:02:05,340
feedback right we'll go down to five thousand water and then I'm gonna swap

6933
06:02:05,340 --> 06:02:11,780
to fish just to like use up all the fish because it's just and and I'll read

6934
06:02:11,780 --> 06:02:24,060
some marshmallow Q&A's if you want to say something say something sorry I know

6935
06:02:24,060 --> 06:02:29,460
I'm not doing that the good way but they there are bots that kill some of the

6936
06:02:29,460 --> 06:02:37,620
hardest bosses in the game in the tens of thousands yeah but keep runescape

6937
06:02:37,620 --> 06:02:46,260
economy from hyper inflating mmm can't believe it capitalism wins again even in

6938
06:02:46,260 --> 06:02:53,620
my video games and I can't escape didn't they just catch some box and wow by

6939
06:02:53,660 --> 06:02:59,500
placing a single rope oh wait I seem to remember something like that I think

6940
06:02:59,500 --> 06:03:05,140
you're right also just gold farmers who are boss they just sell the money later

6941
06:03:05,140 --> 06:03:12,700
on oh yeah you can like buy like in-game currency with like actual money so like

6942
06:03:12,700 --> 06:03:19,220
you get given the money or something because of the there's like a Venezuelan

6943
06:03:19,220 --> 06:03:28,100
meme so the Venezuelan Venezuelan economy went to shambles and and

6944
06:03:28,100 --> 06:03:38,180
basically it became profitable for those individuals to play runescape and sell

6945
06:03:38,180 --> 06:03:42,780
the in-game currency or something yeah my brains like can remember that they sell

6946
06:03:42,780 --> 06:03:52,220
on a third-party set for anyone which is against us oh okay okay okay I get I

6947
06:03:52,220 --> 06:03:57,780
guess it's against us on World of Warcraft as well that could be wrong I

6948
06:03:57,780 --> 06:04:05,220
don't know Azura has gone live okay if there's any bleeding hearts or any

6949

I've had people explain it to me I've never had it in my entire life they say it's when

7014
06:12:21,900 --> 06:12:28,060
your body is still asleep but you wake up and your mind but because you're in a certain phase of

7015
06:12:28,380 --> 06:12:33,420
sleep things become really scary um and like you realize that you're paralyzed and so

7016

being aquatic creatures do we reef flings when you need to be moisturized asking for a really

7031
06:14:26,380 --> 06:14:31,100
important time to pick a question I don't know I feel like we just kind of like hydrate instantly

7032
06:14:31,100 --> 06:14:35,260
when we enter the water again like we're fine to be out of the water but it's just where we are

7033
06:14:37,580 --> 06:14:38,300
the incoming

7034
06:14:42,540 --> 06:14:48,540
the incoming pregnancy is more in lore about how you gave us the girls really gets the

7035

7037
06:15:05,260 --> 06:15:11,900

7038
06:15:13,020 --> 06:15:19,020
I'd just be like give me five babies no more no less that's all I asked

7039
06:15:20,460 --> 06:15:25,500

06:15:26,460 --> 06:15:29,660
brah brah

7041
06:15:32,700 --> 06:15:38,540
I'm I'm touching my tentacles and right now I do it out of principle but I ain't even saying

7042
06:15:38,540 --> 06:15:40,060
anything that's like good

7043
06:15:44,860 --> 06:15:51,500
uh hold on I need to read this one um hi strongy a few things I wanted to say and ask

7044
06:15:51,500 --> 06:15:56,540
most of the questions are for later than the line so feel free to disregard them if you need to be

7045
06:15:58,540 --> 06:16:04,940
first I wanted to say you and other girls really helped keep me sane last week it was tough but

7046
06:16:04,940 --> 06:16:09,420
you made it through oh that's fantastic congrats I don't know if you're a wiefling so I won't call

7047
06:16:09,420 --> 06:16:21,100
you wiefling um would you ever consider opening a PO box I am so sorry however um I've discouraged

7048
06:16:21,100 --> 06:16:31,340
all girls uh from a PO box opening due to the fact that um air trackers are I think no I'm not

7049
06:16:31,340 --> 06:16:36,780
accusing you of putting an air tracker in it or anything like that uh the safety reasons just

7050
06:16:36,780 --> 06:16:44,780
completely outweigh the fun that could be in a PO box I do apologize what is a box a PO box is

7051
06:16:44,780 --> 06:16:51,340
like a setup location where you can send packages and and I would go retrieve them but for safety

7052
06:16:51,340 --> 06:16:57,260
reasons I can't have any of that so I am so sorry but thank you for being interested in sending this

7053
06:16:57,260 --> 06:17:03,580
stuff um have you ever considered making a music playlist of your fave songs through wieflings

7081
06:20:33,340 --> 06:20:37,340
hey stroney you said gen 2 is cooking does that mean we don't have a chance and there won't be

7082
06:20:37,340 --> 06:20:46,940
additions oh no sorry uh no when I say gen 2 is cooking it took a year for concept art model

7083
06:20:47,740 --> 06:20:55,340
assets emotes all of that it takes a year to do that kind of stuff we're at the stage of going

7084
06:20:55,340 --> 06:21:02,140
all the way back to the start all the way back to one paragraph about this girl all the way back to

7085
06:21:02,140 --> 06:21:08,220
write what are the names all the way back like we're all the way back there so please don't there's no

7087
06:21:20,860 --> 06:21:31,420
there is no me um take off your clothes gen 2 fan here no it is um we're all the way back thankfully

7088
06:21:31,420 --> 06:21:40,060
I am not on the heavier side of um development when it comes to names or whatever but it's like

7089
06:21:40,060 --> 06:21:46,220
we're now going all the way back um especially like the lower art I need to think of the story

7090
06:21:49,580 --> 06:21:54,940
but that's what I mean when I say we're all the way back to gen 2 um

7091
06:21:55,740 --> 06:21:56,380
um

7092
06:21:58,140 --> 06:22:02,460
or did you just mean characters then models and niches and such yes that's what I meant sorry

7093
06:22:02,460 --> 06:22:11,580
to scare you no I will it'll be the exact same pro there's no date there's no date I'm which I'm

7094
06:22:11,580 --> 06:22:17,020
so freaking glad there's no date because making a deadline is horrible and I don't ever want to have

7095
06:22:17,020 --> 06:22:24,380
a deadline like that again um the announcements for that kind of stuff only will come out when

7096
06:22:24,380 --> 06:22:33,580
things are ready and as I said the generation one will be up for a year before gen 2 even like

7097
06:22:34,940 --> 06:22:40,460
yeah it'll be at least a year like after do you know I mean I don't know if that makes sense

7098
06:22:40,460 --> 06:22:45,820
good night I'ma turn in please rest well sorry I must have too busy rambling sleep well those of

7099
06:22:45,820 --> 06:22:54,300
you who need to sleep um but yes uh it's it took a year for development it is not quick it's not

7100
06:22:54,300 --> 06:22:58,940
easy it's not fast um and especially when you've got artists that love to go over deadlines um

7101
06:23:01,580 --> 06:23:07,260
it makes everything an absolute nightmare um I kind of said a wee bit of it on the

7102
06:23:07,260 --> 06:23:14,860
Assassin's Creed Brotherhood stream I had planned everything to occur within certain months

7103
06:23:15,660 --> 06:23:22,860
and then everything went to because artists all unanimously went over deadlines so if you're an

7104
06:23:22,860 --> 06:23:29,020
artist that works with us look I'm not mad at you everyone did it so you know you know it's fine

7105
06:23:29,740 --> 06:23:40,140
but uh everyone went over and it made everything happen in May when May was supposed to be

7106
06:23:40,140 --> 06:23:45,020
where I fully focused on getting stuff done for the girls and like we're still kind of

7107
06:23:45,020 --> 06:23:50,060
picking up the pieces like I'm doing stuff I shouldn't really have shouldn't be doing at the stage

7108
06:23:50,060 --> 06:23:55,980
like it was supposed to be handed off or there's supposed to be something else in place um but it

7109
06:23:55,980 --> 06:24:04,140
just a nightmare nightmare nightmare how many marshmallows do you have 850 on the dot actually

7110
06:24:04,140 --> 06:24:18,140
850 um yes I don't even know how I got on that rant hey well I still have two ideas for a gen two

7111
06:24:18,140 --> 06:24:23,980
what would you want to tell us which one two things that I think would be popular a lollipop dragon

7112
06:24:24,060 --> 06:24:31,100
there's no lollipop dragon feature bros curious to get to do it after the pandora on anything

7113
06:24:31,980 --> 06:24:39,580
also I think an insect girl in the style of a traditional Japanese geisha who uses her own

7114
06:24:39,580 --> 06:24:44,540
self to make her clothes would be popular that's unique I've not heard that not a bad idea

7115
06:24:49,180 --> 06:24:59,580
uh I think I need a job I think I need a mute and go hold on it makes me still mix going

7128
06:27:39,180 --> 06:27:41,180
You

7129
06:28:09,180 --> 06:28:11,180
You

7130
06:28:39,180 --> 06:28:41,180
You

7131
06:29:09,180 --> 06:29:32,180
Are you squiddling me right now?

7132
06:29:33,180 --> 06:29:34,180
Plop

7133
06:29:39,180 --> 06:29:41,180
You

7134
06:30:09,180 --> 06:30:11,180
You

7135
06:30:11,180 --> 06:30:13,180
You

7136
06:30:14,180 --> 06:30:16,180
You

7137
06:30:38,180 --> 06:30:42,580
There was no loaf of bread to be had but to it again

7138
06:30:44,180 --> 06:30:46,180
I'm also ovulating like crazy

7139
06:30:47,180 --> 06:30:49,180
Just thought you should know

7140
06:30:51,180 --> 06:30:53,180
The amount of ink that just came out of me

7141
06:30:53,180 --> 06:30:54,180
Holy shit

7142
06:30:59,180 --> 06:31:01,180
So I don't mind talking about this cause it's got hands on

7143
06:31:01,180 --> 06:31:02,180
Check

7144
06:31:03,180 --> 06:31:04,180
When

7145
06:31:04,180 --> 06:31:06,180
When whamming ovulate

7146
06:31:06,180 --> 06:31:09,180
You get a clear ink that comes out of you

7147
06:31:09,180 --> 06:31:11,180
Produced naturally

7148
06:31:11,180 --> 06:31:13,180
And I just had that and I was like what?

7149
06:31:13,180 --> 06:31:15,180
And I'm ovulating so I'm like

7150
06:31:16,180 --> 06:31:17,180
Well

7151
06:31:17,180 --> 06:31:19,180
Now is the best time to send any bibbutes

7152
06:31:21,180 --> 06:31:23,180
I had no idea

7153
06:31:23,180 --> 06:31:26,180
But that makes sense why I'm tired cause

7154
06:31:27,180 --> 06:31:29,180
I just want

7155
06:31:29,180 --> 06:31:32,180
You know my body wants one thing

7156
06:31:32,180 --> 06:31:34,180
Huh? Briefly? Huh?

7157
06:31:38,180 --> 06:31:40,180
I have over 2,000 burnt pork, bitch

7158
06:31:40,180 --> 06:31:42,180
That's so cool

7159
06:31:42,180 --> 06:31:44,180
Good to know

7160
06:31:44,180 --> 06:31:46,180
I made my new one

7161
06:31:46,180 --> 06:31:48,180
Bro I wish I could have shown you that

7162
06:31:48,180 --> 06:31:50,180
Honestly I was like what on earth

7163
06:31:55,180 --> 06:31:56,180
Yes

7164
06:31:56,180 --> 06:31:57,180
I

7165
06:31:59,180 --> 06:32:00,180
I I I

7166
06:32:00,180 --> 06:32:02,180
I don't know what's happening with my butt

7167
06:32:04,180 --> 06:32:06,180
I need to go number 2

7168
06:32:06,180 --> 06:32:08,180
But nothing's happening

7169
06:32:10,180 --> 06:32:12,180
You like receiving bibbutes?

7170
06:32:12,180 --> 06:32:13,180
Go

7171
06:32:13,180 --> 06:32:15,180
Go

7172
06:32:16,180 --> 06:32:19,180
I am down atrocious I volunteer

7173
06:32:19,180 --> 06:32:21,180
Hey guys you wanna make gen 2 right now?

7174
06:32:21,180 --> 06:32:23,180
I'm ovulating

7175
06:32:23,180 --> 06:32:25,180
Oh my god we can just say that

7176
06:32:25,180 --> 06:32:27,180
Every time I'm ovulating I'll be like gen 2

7177
06:32:27,180 --> 06:32:29,180
Come on

7178
06:32:30,180 --> 06:32:32,180
I was a dino chicken

7179
06:32:34,180 --> 06:32:37,180
Humans are just monkeys with fanfare shoes though

7180
06:32:37,180 --> 06:32:39,180
Oh thoughts

7181
06:32:39,180 --> 06:32:41,180
Not quite close enough

7182
06:32:41,180 --> 06:32:44,180
But a few more evolutionary factors in there

7183
06:32:44,180 --> 06:32:47,180
Multiple reefling

7184
06:32:47,180 --> 06:32:49,180
Producers, feature, activity

7185
06:32:49,180 --> 06:32:52,180
Sorry I'm starting

7186
06:32:54,180 --> 06:32:57,180
Well we have over 200 volunteers

7187
06:32:57,180 --> 06:32:59,180
I volunteer

7188
06:33:00,180 --> 06:33:02,180
We did it we're in the

7189
06:33:02,180 --> 06:33:04,180
We're in a million XP

7190
06:33:04,180 --> 06:33:06,180
God wines are so fast

7191
06:33:06,180 --> 06:33:07,180
We were

7192
06:33:07,180 --> 06:33:09,180
I don't even think we were like

7193
06:33:09,180 --> 06:33:11,180
I don't even know what we were at the start of the stream

7194
06:33:11,180 --> 06:33:13,180
But we're already a million XP

7195
06:33:13,180 --> 06:33:15,180
That's fantastic

7196
06:33:16,180 --> 06:33:18,180
Seriously we're making

7197
06:33:18,180 --> 06:33:20,180
I think the wines really is the vehicle

7198
06:33:23,180 --> 06:33:25,180
Aw someone said thank you for existing

7199
06:33:25,180 --> 06:33:27,180
You're so awesome reefling

7200
06:33:27,180 --> 06:33:29,180
Thank you for existing

7201
06:33:39,180 --> 06:33:41,180
Aw

7202
06:33:41,180 --> 06:33:43,180
I don't know

7203
06:33:43,180 --> 06:33:46,180
Someone is currently anonymously editing for the girls

7204
06:33:46,180 --> 06:33:48,180
But they don't want any credit

7205
06:33:48,180 --> 06:33:50,180
But we are gonna upload the videos

7206
06:33:50,180 --> 06:33:52,180
You don't need to apologize for not subtitling it

7207
06:33:52,180 --> 06:33:54,180
Subtitling don't take long on

7208
06:33:54,180 --> 06:33:56,180
The videos are like 3 minutes long

7209
06:33:57,180 --> 06:33:59,180
So

7210
06:33:59,180 --> 06:34:02,180
Are the gen 1 models quintuplets

7211
06:34:03,180 --> 06:34:05,180
I like to joke

7212
06:34:05,180 --> 06:34:07,180
That I had the girls in my stomach

7213
06:34:07,180 --> 06:34:09,180
For like how long

7214
06:34:09,180 --> 06:34:10,180
12 months

7215
06:34:10,180 --> 06:34:12,180
Yeah I guess 12 months on the dot

7216
06:34:14,180 --> 06:34:16,180
Nearly there 598

7217
06:34:16,180 --> 06:34:18,180
Oh my god I owe you guys so much

7218
06:34:18,180 --> 06:34:20,180
There's some more videos I'm not even uploading the first one

7219
06:34:23,180 --> 06:34:26,180
I think I'm gonna be too tired after stream though

7220
06:34:26,180 --> 06:34:29,180
To edit and upload the

7221
06:34:29,180 --> 06:34:31,180
First one

7222
06:34:33,180 --> 06:34:36,180
Oh my god problems are being an overachiever

7223
06:34:36,180 --> 06:34:38,180
For now

7224
06:34:39,180 --> 06:34:42,180
Have you ever played Metal Gear Solid?

7225
06:34:42,180 --> 06:34:44,180
I don't think I've played it

7226
06:34:44,180 --> 06:34:46,180
But I've definitely heard of it

7227
06:34:46,180 --> 06:34:48,180
Game suggestion

7228
06:34:48,180 --> 06:34:50,180
Mad Rat Dead

7229
06:34:50,180 --> 06:34:52,180
It's a rhythm platform game on Nintendo

7230
06:34:52,180 --> 06:34:54,180
How odd

7231
06:34:54,180 --> 06:34:55,180
Creaks

7232
06:34:55,180 --> 06:34:57,180
It's a puzzle game with a rare art style

7233
06:34:57,180 --> 06:34:59,180
The storyline is decent and you can use it

7234
06:34:59,180 --> 06:35:01,180
To interact with chat if you get sucked

7235
06:35:01,180 --> 06:35:04,180
I do it like when chat holds my hand through game

7236
06:35:04,180 --> 06:35:07,180
How'd you mention SteelSeries during the collab

7237
06:35:07,180 --> 06:35:09,180
Hopefully it works well for you

7238
06:35:09,180 --> 06:35:12,180
No whenever Azura talks to me

7239
06:35:12,180 --> 06:35:15,180
I don't know if the other girls can hear Azura

7240
06:35:15,180 --> 06:35:18,180
Whenever Azura talks to me via discord

7241
06:35:18,180 --> 06:35:21,180
Her make always cuts out and can't handle her

7242
06:35:21,180 --> 06:35:24,180
And I'm like Azura get that noise gate off

7243
06:35:24,180 --> 06:35:26,180
And she's like I've not got anything on

7244
06:35:26,180 --> 06:35:28,180
And I'm like what is?

7245
06:35:28,180 --> 06:35:30,180
Cause I can never hear her

7246
06:35:30,180 --> 06:35:32,180
I think the other girls can hear her

7247
06:35:34,180 --> 06:35:37,180
But I can never hear her when we have a collab

7248
06:35:37,180 --> 06:35:39,180
On discord or anything

7249
06:35:39,180 --> 06:35:42,180
And when she gets excited it cuts into her even more

7250
06:35:42,180 --> 06:35:45,180
But I don't know if she has discord fillers on maybe

7251
06:35:46,180 --> 06:35:49,180
Which is why I'm like ah Azura are you in that SteelSeries

7252
06:35:49,180 --> 06:35:51,180
Cause I've said to her a few times now

7253
06:35:51,180 --> 06:35:52,180
I'm not annoyed or anything

7254
06:35:52,180 --> 06:35:55,180
It's more like a meme where I'm like ah SteelSeries

7255
06:35:57,180 --> 06:35:59,180
Someone has sent me a cat box

7256
06:35:59,180 --> 06:36:00,180
Should it open up?

7257
06:36:00,180 --> 06:36:02,180
Fuck it I'm feeling risky

7258
06:36:02,180 --> 06:36:03,180
What is it?

7259
06:36:03,180 --> 06:36:04,180
It's a picture

7260
06:36:04,180 --> 06:36:05,180
Whoa!

7261
06:36:05,180 --> 06:36:06,180
Okay!

7262
06:36:06,180 --> 06:36:07,180
Yep

7263
06:36:07,180 --> 06:36:09,180
That's the picture alright

7264
06:36:12,180 --> 06:36:16,180
Okay I'm not gonna open up any cat box

7265
06:36:17,180 --> 06:36:18,180
Links

7266
06:36:19,180 --> 06:36:20,180
Well I'm true

7267
06:36:25,180 --> 06:36:26,180
Okay

7268
06:36:26,180 --> 06:36:28,180
Okay swordfish

7269
06:36:28,180 --> 06:36:29,180
Swordfish yes

7270
06:36:34,180 --> 06:36:36,180
Share it with a class male

7271
06:36:38,180 --> 06:36:39,180
Hi

7272
06:36:39,180 --> 06:36:42,180
Would you be okay with me using this whole smegment?

7273
06:36:42,180 --> 06:36:44,180
Smegment? Oh my god

7274
06:36:44,180 --> 06:36:45,180
I've got cocks on my mind

7275
06:36:45,180 --> 06:36:46,180
What the fuck

7276
06:36:46,180 --> 06:36:50,180
So small segment of the clapping audio for a meme

7277
06:36:50,180 --> 06:36:51,180
Yeah sure

7278
06:36:51,180 --> 06:36:52,180
If so would you rather wait now

7279
06:36:52,180 --> 06:36:54,180
Now you can post it it's fine honestly

7280
06:36:54,180 --> 06:36:57,180
It's cause it's gonna be publicly posted

7281
06:36:57,180 --> 06:37:00,180
It's not really an issue to make any of the content a meme

7282
06:37:00,180 --> 06:37:01,180
I'm so sorry

7283
06:37:01,180 --> 06:37:02,180
Ah frickin

7284
06:37:02,180 --> 06:37:03,180
That was

7285
06:37:03,180 --> 06:37:05,180
That would poke your eye out

7286
06:37:05,180 --> 06:37:06,180
That's what I'm saying

7287
06:37:06,180 --> 06:37:07,180
That's what I'm gonna leave out

7288
06:37:07,180 --> 06:37:08,180
That would poke your eye out

7289
06:37:08,180 --> 06:37:09,180
Um

7290
06:37:11,180 --> 06:37:14,180
Oh she's so damn bad just like us

7291
06:37:14,180 --> 06:37:16,180
Keep being that lovable goofy gibber you are

7292
06:37:16,180 --> 06:37:18,180
Oh thank you Reefling

7293
06:37:18,180 --> 06:37:20,180
Strony

7294
06:37:20,180 --> 06:37:21,180
Reefling

7295
06:37:21,180 --> 06:37:24,180
I listened to the girlfriend begs the whole day tomorrow

7296
06:37:24,180 --> 06:37:27,180
I remembered you apologizing but no editing as much

7297
06:37:27,180 --> 06:37:30,180
I think at least in this case less editing

7298
06:37:30,180 --> 06:37:32,180
I think added to the quality

7299
06:37:32,180 --> 06:37:35,180
I'm so frickin glad you agree Reefling

7300
06:37:35,180 --> 06:37:41,180
I have been enjoying like not doing scripted stuff and try hard in

7301
06:37:41,180 --> 06:37:42,180
Um

7302
06:37:44,180 --> 06:37:45,180
Um

7303
06:37:45,180 --> 06:37:49,180
Like I have been enjoying recording ASMR

7304
06:37:49,180 --> 06:37:53,180
That isn't scripted and I'm doing it off the top of my head

7305
06:37:53,180 --> 06:37:54,180
Wait what do you say

7306
06:37:54,180 --> 06:37:56,180
There was one part where you seemed to accidentally say

7307
06:37:56,180 --> 06:37:58,180
Let me hold your fireman

7308
06:37:58,180 --> 06:38:00,180
Then wait let me hold your hose Mr. Fireman

7309
06:38:00,180 --> 06:38:01,180
It felt so natural

7310
06:38:01,180 --> 06:38:03,180
Cause of how frantic you were becoming

7311
06:38:03,180 --> 06:38:06,180
Yeah cause I did it all off the top of my head

7312
06:38:06,180 --> 06:38:07,180
Um

7313
06:38:07,180 --> 06:38:10,180
I don't know if it was scripted but you also yawned at one point

7314
06:38:10,180 --> 06:38:12,180
If it was intentional or adlib it was so natural

7315
06:38:12,180 --> 06:38:16,180
No I've been enjoying doing like non hyper edited

7316
06:38:16,180 --> 06:38:18,180
Super production of the wazoo

7317
06:38:18,180 --> 06:38:20,180
I've been enjoying doing like such casual

7318
06:38:20,180 --> 06:38:22,180
Um it's been so lovely

7319
06:38:22,180 --> 06:38:24,180
I've been enjoying it thoroughly

7320
06:38:24,180 --> 06:38:27,180
I really hope you enjoy the first like thank you for 1000 subs

7321
06:38:27,180 --> 06:38:29,180
Cause it's just me meemen

7322
06:38:29,180 --> 06:38:30,180
Um

7323
06:38:30,180 --> 06:38:32,180
I'm back from work

7324
06:38:33,180 --> 06:38:36,180
Okay but how many scrawny hands big was it

7325
06:38:36,180 --> 06:38:38,180
I mean

7326
06:38:38,180 --> 06:38:41,180
There wasn't a ruler in the picture but

7327
06:38:41,180 --> 06:38:44,180
From the glance I got before I closed it

7328
06:38:44,180 --> 06:38:47,180
It was pretty

7329
06:38:49,180 --> 06:38:51,180
I laughed so much in that part

7330
06:38:51,180 --> 06:38:54,180
I don't know if it was scripted or not

7331
06:38:54,180 --> 06:38:57,180
But if any of it was scripted

7332
06:38:57,180 --> 06:38:59,180
That kind of reinforces my point

7333
06:38:59,180 --> 06:39:00,180
So much of the audio scripted

7334
06:39:00,180 --> 06:39:02,180
Or not felt natural even the mistakes seemed

7335
06:39:02,180 --> 06:39:04,180
No no that was just me

7336
06:39:04,180 --> 06:39:06,180
That's just me being unable to read

7337
06:39:06,180 --> 06:39:07,180
Unable to read

7338
06:39:07,180 --> 06:39:10,180
Unable to formulate my thoughts

7339
06:39:10,180 --> 06:39:12,180
Into our proper sentence structure

7340
06:39:12,180 --> 06:39:14,180
I know it was just the meme but it was really fun

7341
06:39:14,180 --> 06:39:16,180
And good I think it would be neat

7342
06:39:16,180 --> 06:39:18,180
To do the natural style more

7343
06:39:18,180 --> 06:39:19,180
I freaking agree

7344
06:39:19,180 --> 06:39:21,180
I 100% am doing natural style

7345
06:39:21,180 --> 06:39:23,180
Open natural style

7346
06:39:23,180 --> 06:39:25,180
A

7347
06:39:25,180 --> 06:39:27,180
Six a lady

7348
06:39:27,180 --> 06:39:29,180
What

7349
06:39:29,180 --> 06:39:31,180
It was too early sorry

7350
06:39:32,180 --> 06:39:34,180
Okay we're all

7351
06:39:34,180 --> 06:39:36,180
As I said we're gonna finish cooking all the swordfish

7352
06:39:36,180 --> 06:39:38,180
And then we'll go back to wine

7353
06:39:38,180 --> 06:39:41,180
Just cause wine is so demanding

7354
06:39:42,180 --> 06:39:44,180
Um

7355
06:39:45,180 --> 06:39:47,180
If you want to help hold the hose

7356
06:39:47,180 --> 06:39:49,180
During a number one does that mean

7357
06:39:49,180 --> 06:39:51,180
I get to hold you up when you go number one

7358
06:39:51,180 --> 06:39:52,180
Bruh

7359
06:39:52,180 --> 06:39:55,180
I would go everywhere if you did that

7360
06:39:56,180 --> 06:39:58,180
Um

7361
06:39:59,180 --> 06:40:00,180
Strony

7362
06:40:00,180 --> 06:40:02,180
I felt it's imperative to let you know

7363
06:40:02,180 --> 06:40:04,180
There's a fortnite skin called Tropical Punch Zoe

7364
06:40:04,180 --> 06:40:06,180
That looks shockingly like you

7365
06:40:09,180 --> 06:40:12,180
I swear to god if I look like a fortnite character

7366
06:40:14,180 --> 06:40:16,180
If I look like a fortnite

7367
06:40:17,180 --> 06:40:19,180
Ahh

7368
06:40:21,180 --> 06:40:23,180
I can

7369
06:40:23,180 --> 06:40:25,180
I can cane to see it

7370
06:40:25,180 --> 06:40:27,180
I know what you mean with the bows on our heads

7371
06:40:29,180 --> 06:40:30,180
I get it

7372
06:40:30,180 --> 06:40:31,180
Yeah I get it

7373
06:40:31,180 --> 06:40:32,180
No that's not bad

7374
06:40:32,180 --> 06:40:34,180
Thankfully I don't look too much

7375
06:40:34,180 --> 06:40:36,180
Like

7376
06:40:36,180 --> 06:40:38,180
But I get it

7377
06:40:40,180 --> 06:40:43,180
Would only need to ask once to hold off

7378
06:40:44,180 --> 06:40:46,180
By the way the subtitles were actually fun

7379
06:40:47,180 --> 06:40:49,180
But why didn't you

7380
06:40:49,180 --> 06:40:51,180
Make someone else do them

7381
06:40:51,180 --> 06:40:53,180
Well when I do all that stuff

7382
06:40:53,180 --> 06:40:54,180
There's like

7383
06:40:54,180 --> 06:40:55,180
No

7384
06:40:55,180 --> 06:40:57,180
Subtitling takes so much time

7385
06:40:57,180 --> 06:40:59,180
It's just such a waste of money as well

7386
06:40:59,180 --> 06:41:01,180
Cause not everyone reads subtitles

7387
06:41:03,180 --> 06:41:06,180
To like outsource that work even further

7388
06:41:06,180 --> 06:41:07,180
Is just like

7389
06:41:07,180 --> 06:41:09,180
I'd rather just save the money

7390
06:41:09,180 --> 06:41:11,180
And spend it on the girls type thing

7391
06:41:11,180 --> 06:41:13,180
Because I could have sent that to an editor

7392
06:41:13,180 --> 06:41:16,180
And I could have sent that to a video renderer type thing

7393
06:41:16,180 --> 06:41:17,180
It's just like

7394
06:41:17,180 --> 06:41:19,180
I'll just do it myself

7395
06:41:19,180 --> 06:41:21,180
You know

7396
06:41:25,180 --> 06:41:27,180
Ooh I've got 14 more questions

7397
06:41:27,180 --> 06:41:29,180
Don't mind me

7398
06:41:29,180 --> 06:41:31,180
Or is it even a question

7399
06:41:36,180 --> 06:41:38,180
Let me know what you think of that in people

7400
06:41:38,180 --> 06:41:40,180
I'm not doing live reviews right now

7401
06:41:40,180 --> 06:41:41,180
Are you joking me

7402
06:41:41,180 --> 06:41:43,180
You guys are gonna like start hearing yourself

7403
06:41:43,180 --> 06:41:45,180
In the death of audio

7404
06:41:45,180 --> 06:41:47,180
On the topic

7405
06:41:47,180 --> 06:41:49,180
Conspiracy series

7406
06:41:49,180 --> 06:41:51,180
One game would be a hit to what you play

7407
06:41:51,180 --> 06:41:52,180
Disco Asylum

7408
06:41:52,180 --> 06:41:54,180
It's basically a spruced up visual novel

7409
06:41:54,180 --> 06:41:56,180
Where you play as a deeply

7410
06:41:56,180 --> 06:41:58,180
Schizophrenic police officer having a small

7411
06:41:58,180 --> 06:42:01,180
Solve a murder while constantly arguing with the voices

7412
06:42:01,180 --> 06:42:03,180
All that's interesting

7413
06:42:03,180 --> 06:42:05,180
Hold on that looks like nice and niche

7414
06:42:05,180 --> 06:42:07,180
Let me give that a cheeky go

7415
06:42:07,180 --> 06:42:09,180
Oh god I was preemptive again

7416
06:42:10,180 --> 06:42:12,180
We're at 4.8 on our

7417
06:42:13,180 --> 06:42:15,180
But nothing happens at all

7418
06:42:23,180 --> 06:42:25,180
Okay I can't open that on stream

7419
06:42:25,180 --> 06:42:27,180
But you know what you've sent

7420
06:42:27,180 --> 06:42:29,180
I love your long streams

7421
06:42:29,180 --> 06:42:30,180
I can do my thing

7422
06:42:30,180 --> 06:42:32,180
Even go to sleep when I'm back

7423
06:42:32,180 --> 06:42:33,180
And you're still there

7424
06:42:33,180 --> 06:42:34,180
Thank you for your work

7425
06:42:34,180 --> 06:42:36,180
Oh you're more than welcome

7426
06:42:36,180 --> 06:42:38,180
I'm glad I can help you

7427
06:42:38,180 --> 06:42:40,180
Get ready for working stuff

7428
06:42:40,180 --> 06:42:42,180
Listen to me in the background

7429
06:42:42,180 --> 06:42:44,180
And then I'm bing-ching when you get back

7430
06:42:45,180 --> 06:42:47,180
The kicking sound in old school

7431
06:42:47,180 --> 06:42:48,180
Runescape is printed

7432
06:42:48,180 --> 06:42:50,180
Oh do you want it off?

7433
06:42:56,180 --> 06:42:57,180
Do you want it off?

7434
06:42:57,180 --> 06:42:59,180
Or do you want it a little?

7435
06:43:00,180 --> 06:43:02,180
I can't even hear it at 2%

7436
06:43:02,180 --> 06:43:04,180
You know that 4%

7437
06:43:06,180 --> 06:43:07,180
There

7438
06:43:08,180 --> 06:43:10,180
I'm gonna like blast your ears

7439
06:43:12,180 --> 06:43:14,180
The voices in my head stop

7440
06:43:14,180 --> 06:43:15,180
Thank you

7441
06:43:15,180 --> 06:43:16,180
Wait why do you

7442
06:43:16,180 --> 06:43:17,180
Oh I like them

7443
06:43:17,180 --> 06:43:18,180
Ah please

7444
06:43:18,180 --> 06:43:21,180
Wait why do you guys not tell me so much earlier

7445
06:43:21,180 --> 06:43:23,180
I'm sorry I didn't mean to subject you

7446
06:43:23,180 --> 06:43:25,180
To such

7447
06:43:25,180 --> 06:43:27,180
Fallacies?

7448
06:43:27,180 --> 06:43:28,180
Fallacies?

7449
06:43:28,180 --> 06:43:30,180
I don't think that's the correct word

7450
06:43:30,180 --> 06:43:32,180
But I'm glad you're trying to use words

7451
06:43:32,180 --> 06:43:34,180
Outside your comfort zone

7452
06:43:35,180 --> 06:43:37,180
Hey Strone

7453
06:43:37,180 --> 06:43:39,180
Just wondering when you plan on sitting on my face

7454
06:43:39,180 --> 06:43:40,180
Right now

7455
06:43:41,180 --> 06:43:42,180
Lie down

7456
06:43:47,180 --> 06:43:49,180
Since AI is blowing up

7457
06:43:49,180 --> 06:43:50,180
Right now

7458
06:43:50,180 --> 06:43:52,180
Any ideas of implementing it in your content?

7459
06:43:53,180 --> 06:43:54,180
No

7460
06:43:54,180 --> 06:43:56,180
And do you even want to implement it?

7461
06:43:56,180 --> 06:43:58,180
I

7462
06:44:03,180 --> 06:44:05,180
The only

7463
06:44:05,180 --> 06:44:07,180
I wouldn't put

7464
06:44:07,180 --> 06:44:09,180
AI content

7465
06:44:09,180 --> 06:44:10,180
Like monetize it

7466
06:44:10,180 --> 06:44:12,180
I don't think that's right

7467
06:44:12,180 --> 06:44:14,180
I don't mind like AI memes of myself

7468
06:44:14,180 --> 06:44:15,180
Or something like that

7469
06:44:15,180 --> 06:44:16,180
Like that's funny

7470
06:44:19,180 --> 06:44:20,180
But like

7471
06:44:20,180 --> 06:44:21,180
Actually AI content

7472
06:44:21,180 --> 06:44:23,180
Like I wouldn't use AI content

7473
06:44:23,180 --> 06:44:24,180
On a thumbnail

7474
06:44:24,180 --> 06:44:25,180
And then earn money from it

7475
06:44:25,180 --> 06:44:27,180
Like I don't think

7476
06:44:27,180 --> 06:44:28,180
I don't think that's very nice

7477
06:44:28,180 --> 06:44:30,180
Because as a content creator

7478
06:44:30,180 --> 06:44:32,180
Like someone can literally

7479
06:44:32,180 --> 06:44:33,180
You know yank your voice

7480
06:44:33,180 --> 06:44:35,180
And then make money off of it

7481
06:44:35,180 --> 06:44:37,180
And it was like well why would I do the same

7482
06:44:37,180 --> 06:44:38,180
To someone else

7483
06:44:38,180 --> 06:44:39,180
Like that's not nice

7484
06:44:39,180 --> 06:44:41,180
You know

7485
06:44:41,180 --> 06:44:43,180
Can you hold it?

7486
06:44:43,180 --> 06:44:45,180
Do you think you can handle it?

7487
06:44:47,180 --> 06:44:48,180
And

7488
06:44:48,180 --> 06:44:50,180
Have you considered trading a chat box

7489
06:44:50,180 --> 06:44:51,180
From your stream?

7490
06:44:51,180 --> 06:44:52,180
Absolutely not

7491
06:44:52,180 --> 06:44:53,180
Are you kidding me?

7492
06:44:53,180 --> 06:44:54,180
That all that thing we'll see is

7493
06:44:54,180 --> 06:44:55,180
Use the other hole

7494
06:44:55,180 --> 06:44:56,180
Refling

7495
06:44:56,180 --> 06:44:57,180
Other hole

7496
06:44:57,180 --> 06:44:58,180
Other hole

7497
06:44:58,180 --> 06:44:59,180
Other hole

7498
06:44:59,180 --> 06:45:01,180
That all that chat box is going to say

7499
06:45:04,180 --> 06:45:06,180
I don't really use Marshmallow very often

7500
06:45:06,180 --> 06:45:09,180
If someone wanted to send you a bibliote

7501
06:45:09,180 --> 06:45:10,180
How it says

7502
06:45:10,180 --> 06:45:11,180
Oh you do

7503
06:45:11,180 --> 06:45:14,180
What's called a cat box link

7504
06:45:14,180 --> 06:45:16,180
And then you send me the link

7505
06:45:16,180 --> 06:45:18,180
And then I look at the link

7506
06:45:19,180 --> 06:45:21,180
And the rest is history

7507
06:45:23,180 --> 06:45:25,180
Hmm

7508
06:45:28,180 --> 06:45:30,180
ASMR Booth Hypnoscript

7509
06:45:30,180 --> 06:45:32,180
I've already recorded the

7510
06:45:32,180 --> 06:45:34,180
ASMR Booth

7511
06:45:34,180 --> 06:45:35,180
Plot

7512
06:45:35,180 --> 06:45:37,180
Which was funny as anything

7513
06:45:37,180 --> 06:45:39,180
I haven't

7514
06:45:39,180 --> 06:45:41,180
Done too much

7515
06:45:41,180 --> 06:45:42,180
Hypno

7516
06:45:42,180 --> 06:45:43,180
Because

7517
06:45:43,180 --> 06:45:45,180
Of Patreon's restrictions

7518
06:45:45,180 --> 06:45:47,180
But I do have a four part series

7519
06:45:47,180 --> 06:45:49,180
That will go up

7520
06:45:50,180 --> 06:45:52,180
On the alternate Twitter for free

7521
06:45:52,180 --> 06:45:55,180
Because it's not welcome

7522
06:45:55,180 --> 06:45:57,180
And the replacement audio

7523
06:45:57,180 --> 06:46:00,180
Is going to be my honey cup of tea

7524
06:46:00,180 --> 06:46:02,180
Oops sorry

7525
06:46:03,180 --> 06:46:05,180
I'm losing it

7526
06:46:05,180 --> 06:46:06,180
I don't know

7527
06:46:06,180 --> 06:46:08,180
I don't know why I'm like so sleepy

7528
06:46:08,180 --> 06:46:09,180
After eating

7529
06:46:09,180 --> 06:46:11,180
I thought you were supposed to get energy from food

7530
06:46:11,180 --> 06:46:13,180
You lied to me

7531
06:46:13,180 --> 06:46:15,180
Will you permanently scramble my brain

7532
06:46:15,180 --> 06:46:16,180
Pretty pretty please

7533
06:46:16,180 --> 06:46:17,180
Aw I can't do that

7534
06:46:17,180 --> 06:46:19,180
You're supposed to

7535
06:46:19,180 --> 06:46:21,180
Be having a good time

7536
06:46:25,180 --> 06:46:26,180
Just

7537
06:46:26,180 --> 06:46:27,180
Pinching

7538
06:46:27,180 --> 06:46:29,180
Hypnosis as a concept

7539
06:46:31,180 --> 06:46:34,180
Make great hypnotic focal point

7540
06:46:34,180 --> 06:46:35,180
As you sway back and forth

7541
06:46:35,180 --> 06:46:36,180
And burn yourself and down

7542
06:46:36,180 --> 06:46:37,180
Have you seen

7543
06:46:37,180 --> 06:46:39,180
The derriere VTuber models

7544
06:46:39,180 --> 06:46:41,180
That you can get

7545
06:46:41,180 --> 06:46:43,180
I wouldn't mind that honestly

7546
06:46:43,180 --> 06:46:45,180
I think that would be good

7547
06:46:46,180 --> 06:46:47,180
Hey mom

7548
06:46:47,180 --> 06:46:49,180
Congrats on the second week of debut

7549
06:46:49,180 --> 06:46:50,180
I'm one of the newer Mifflin

7550
06:46:50,180 --> 06:46:51,180
Hi

7551
06:46:51,180 --> 06:46:52,180
Hi Mifflin

7552
06:46:52,180 --> 06:46:53,180
I must say

7553
06:46:53,180 --> 06:46:55,180
Your constant chatting has become a daily routine

7554
06:46:55,180 --> 06:46:56,180
In my life

7555
06:46:56,180 --> 06:46:58,180
And completely infatuated with you

7556
06:46:58,180 --> 06:46:59,180
Mostly with you

7557
06:46:59,180 --> 06:47:00,180
And your girls

7558
06:47:00,180 --> 06:47:01,180
So thanks

7559
06:47:01,180 --> 06:47:02,180
Oh no thank you

7560
06:47:02,180 --> 06:47:03,180
Thank you for being open to

7561
06:47:03,180 --> 06:47:05,180
A new like line of content

7562
06:47:05,180 --> 06:47:07,180
You made me really happy

7563
06:47:07,180 --> 06:47:08,180
In this vacation

7564
06:47:08,180 --> 06:47:10,180
And I'm excited for the Lord of the Rings marathon

7565
06:47:10,180 --> 06:47:11,180
On Christmas

7566
06:47:12,180 --> 06:47:13,180
Oh and

7567
06:47:14,180 --> 06:47:16,180
If there's a question

7568
06:47:16,180 --> 06:47:18,180
When can we expect your membership streams

7569
06:47:18,180 --> 06:47:20,180
Membership streams start next week

7570
06:47:20,180 --> 06:47:22,180
You will see it on the schedule

7571
06:47:22,180 --> 06:47:23,180
That I post publicly

7572
06:47:26,180 --> 06:47:27,180
That

7573
06:47:27,180 --> 06:47:29,180
Will go live

7574
06:47:29,180 --> 06:47:30,180
After

7575
06:47:30,180 --> 06:47:31,180
Buckshot

7576
06:47:31,180 --> 06:47:32,180
Roulette

7577
06:47:32,180 --> 06:47:33,180
Is when it will go up

7578
06:47:33,180 --> 06:47:35,180
There are three member streams

7579
06:47:35,180 --> 06:47:36,180
In the first week

7580
06:47:36,180 --> 06:47:38,180
And we'll take it from there

7581
06:47:38,180 --> 06:47:40,180
And see how we're doing

7582
06:47:40,180 --> 06:47:42,180
How we're doing

7583
06:47:42,180 --> 06:47:43,180
Remember vibing

7584
06:47:45,180 --> 06:47:46,180
Actually no idea

7585
06:47:46,180 --> 06:47:47,180
What this is

7586
06:47:47,180 --> 06:47:48,180
I need

7587
06:47:49,180 --> 06:47:51,180
I think it's called like cat box

7588
06:47:51,180 --> 06:47:52,180
Litter box

7589
06:47:52,180 --> 06:47:53,180
Or something like that

7590
06:47:54,180 --> 06:47:56,180
Is for long enough

7591
06:47:56,180 --> 06:47:57,180
Asking for a friend

7592
06:47:57,180 --> 06:47:58,180
Replay

7593
06:48:00,180 --> 06:48:02,180
Did me mentioning ovulation

7594
06:48:02,180 --> 06:48:04,180
Get you all riled up

7595
06:48:07,180 --> 06:48:09,180
I was going to show

7596
06:48:09,180 --> 06:48:10,180
On

7597
06:48:11,180 --> 06:48:12,180
Bansley

7598
06:48:16,180 --> 06:48:18,180
Some stuff later on

7599
06:48:21,180 --> 06:48:23,180
We're hired wired that way

7600
06:48:25,180 --> 06:48:27,180
More than enough

7601
06:48:27,180 --> 06:48:29,180
I need to cut the booth

7602
06:48:32,180 --> 06:48:34,180
Keep doing that early

7603
06:48:34,180 --> 06:48:36,180
I'm not max

7604
06:48:36,180 --> 06:48:37,180
A burnt one

7605
06:48:38,180 --> 06:48:39,180
Brave

7606
06:48:41,180 --> 06:48:43,180
I burnt a swordfish

7607
06:48:43,180 --> 06:48:44,180
Who am I?

7608
06:48:44,180 --> 06:48:45,180
Who do I think I am?

7609
06:48:45,180 --> 06:48:46,180
Just wasting

7610
06:48:46,180 --> 06:48:47,180
Litter box

7611
06:48:48,180 --> 06:48:50,180
Is time for a cat box

7612
06:48:50,180 --> 06:48:51,180
Is the three days

7613
06:48:54,180 --> 06:48:56,180
Why is this website Japanese?

7614
06:48:56,180 --> 06:48:57,180
I can't speak Japanese

7615
06:48:57,180 --> 06:48:58,180
Can you speak Japanese?

7616
06:48:58,180 --> 06:48:59,180
No

7617
06:49:00,180 --> 06:49:02,180
Why did you pick a Japanese website then?

7618
06:49:02,180 --> 06:49:04,180
I thought you were the gamer of the six

7619
06:49:04,180 --> 06:49:05,180
Not a weeb

7620
06:49:05,180 --> 06:49:06,180
I still love you, you dork

7621
06:49:06,180 --> 06:49:08,180
The other websites that offer

7622
06:49:08,180 --> 06:49:09,180
This kind of Q&A thing

7623
06:49:09,180 --> 06:49:11,180
Are very broken

7624
06:49:11,180 --> 06:49:12,180
Cat box

7625
06:49:12,180 --> 06:49:14,180
Curious

7626
06:49:14,180 --> 06:49:15,180
Cat

7627
06:49:15,180 --> 06:49:17,180
Is very broken

7628
06:49:17,180 --> 06:49:19,180
So however

7629
06:49:19,180 --> 06:49:20,180
This Japanese website

7630
06:49:20,180 --> 06:49:21,180
Called Marshmallow

7631
06:49:21,180 --> 06:49:22,180
Isn't broken

7632
06:49:22,180 --> 06:49:24,180
It's actually very highly functional

7633
06:49:24,180 --> 06:49:26,180
Other than the filters

7634
06:49:26,180 --> 06:49:27,180
You have to be a smart level

7635
06:49:27,180 --> 06:49:28,180
Refling

7636
06:49:28,180 --> 06:49:30,180
And bypass the filters

7637
06:49:32,180 --> 06:49:33,180
Have you thought of more games

7638
06:49:33,180 --> 06:49:35,180
You can play in stream snipes

7639
06:49:35,180 --> 06:49:36,180
With the whole chat

7640
06:49:36,180 --> 06:49:37,180
In the future

7641
06:49:37,180 --> 06:49:38,180
After you get 99k

7642
06:49:38,180 --> 06:49:39,180
Absolutely

7643
06:49:39,180 --> 06:49:40,180
Every week

7644
06:49:40,180 --> 06:49:41,180
I plan on doing

7645
06:49:41,180 --> 06:49:43,180
Some version of a stream snip game

7646
06:49:45,180 --> 06:49:46,180
You burn swordfish

7647
06:49:46,180 --> 06:49:47,180
Until 80 on a range

7648
06:49:47,180 --> 06:49:49,180
And 86 on a fire

7649
06:49:51,180 --> 06:49:52,180
Yes, no

7650
06:49:52,180 --> 06:49:53,180
There's plenty

7651
06:49:53,180 --> 06:49:54,180
So Elden Ring

7652
06:49:54,180 --> 06:49:55,180
Is our next stream snip game

7653
06:49:55,180 --> 06:49:56,180
That we'll be doing

7654
06:49:56,180 --> 06:49:57,180
Tons of

7655
06:49:57,180 --> 06:49:58,180
November

7656
06:49:58,180 --> 06:49:59,180
I know it's quite far away

7657
06:49:59,180 --> 06:50:00,180
November

7658
06:50:00,180 --> 06:50:02,180
Definitely lots of Isaac

7659
06:50:02,180 --> 06:50:03,180
And

7660
06:50:04,180 --> 06:50:06,180
I was going to do

7661
06:50:06,180 --> 06:50:07,180
Drunk Apex

7662
06:50:07,180 --> 06:50:08,180
But everyone rolled their eyes

7663
06:50:08,180 --> 06:50:10,180
At me at the same time

7664
06:50:10,180 --> 06:50:11,180
So maybe not Drunk Apex

7665
06:50:11,180 --> 06:50:12,180
I don't know

7666
06:50:13,180 --> 06:50:15,180
Some sort of drunk multiplayer game

7667
06:50:15,180 --> 06:50:16,180
I think Valorant

7668
06:50:16,180 --> 06:50:18,180
Also gets shot on as well

7669
06:50:18,180 --> 06:50:19,180
And I'm like

7670
06:50:19,180 --> 06:50:20,180
But I can have

7671
06:50:20,180 --> 06:50:21,180
Four other

7672
06:50:21,180 --> 06:50:23,180
Reflings in the lobby

7673
06:50:28,180 --> 06:50:29,180
But you

7674
06:50:30,180 --> 06:50:31,180
Ugh

7675
06:50:31,180 --> 06:50:32,180
How do we

7676
06:50:32,180 --> 06:50:33,180
I guess

7677
06:50:33,180 --> 06:50:34,180
So sleepy after I ate that food

7678
06:50:34,180 --> 06:50:35,180
I don't understand

7679
06:50:35,180 --> 06:50:37,180
I had eight hours of sleep

7680
06:50:47,180 --> 06:50:48,180
Uhh

7681
06:50:52,180 --> 06:50:53,180
You didn't answer

7682
06:50:53,180 --> 06:50:54,180
The question

7683
06:50:54,180 --> 06:50:55,180
How BB is four enough

7684
06:50:55,180 --> 06:50:56,180
Yeah

7685
06:50:56,180 --> 06:50:57,180
Don't be silly

7686
06:50:57,180 --> 06:50:58,180
Of course it is

7687
06:51:00,180 --> 06:51:01,180
Are you going to have

7688
06:51:01,180 --> 06:51:03,180
A password set up on Elden Ring

7689
06:51:03,180 --> 06:51:04,180
So you can only summon

7690
06:51:04,180 --> 06:51:05,180
Reflings

7691
06:51:05,180 --> 06:51:06,180
Yeah, of course

7692
06:51:07,180 --> 06:51:08,180
Maybe call it shell

7693
06:51:10,180 --> 06:51:11,180
Or eyes

7694
06:51:11,180 --> 06:51:12,180
Because I hypnotise you

7695
06:51:12,180 --> 06:51:13,180
With my

7696
06:51:13,180 --> 06:51:14,180
Eyes

7697
06:51:16,180 --> 06:51:17,180
But yes

7698
06:51:17,180 --> 06:51:18,180
There'll be two

7699
06:51:18,180 --> 06:51:19,180
Good reflings

7700
06:51:19,180 --> 06:51:20,180
And one bad refling

7701
06:51:20,180 --> 06:51:22,180
Like an invader

7702
06:51:22,180 --> 06:51:23,180
So we can

7703
06:51:23,180 --> 06:51:24,180
We don't get a bonsai

7704
06:51:24,180 --> 06:51:25,180
Bonsai

7705
06:51:26,180 --> 06:51:28,180
I thought you needed ten hours

7706
06:51:28,180 --> 06:51:29,180
Maybe that's why

7707
06:51:30,180 --> 06:51:31,180
A big

7708
06:51:31,180 --> 06:51:33,180
It wasn't even a big meal

7709
06:51:33,180 --> 06:51:35,180
I literally had a muffin

7710
06:51:35,180 --> 06:51:37,180
In a nature valley bar

7711
06:51:37,180 --> 06:51:38,180
A cup of tea

7712
06:51:38,180 --> 06:51:39,180
A cold-out which I've not even

7713
06:51:39,180 --> 06:51:40,180
Finished in some water

7714
06:51:40,180 --> 06:51:41,180
And my brain's like

7715
06:51:41,180 --> 06:51:42,180
Okay, let's go down again

7716
06:51:42,180 --> 06:51:43,180
I'm like

7717
06:51:43,180 --> 06:51:44,180
Bro

7718
06:51:44,180 --> 06:51:45,180
We're not even halfway

7719
06:51:45,180 --> 06:51:46,180
Through this endurance stream

7720
06:51:50,180 --> 06:51:51,180
So I heard

7721
06:51:51,180 --> 06:51:52,180
Mummy was ovulating

7722
06:51:52,180 --> 06:51:54,180
Ambient refling

7723
06:51:54,180 --> 06:51:55,180
Cicero

7724
06:51:55,180 --> 06:51:56,180
Cicero

7725
06:51:57,180 --> 06:51:58,180
Cicero?

7726
06:51:59,180 --> 06:52:00,180
Refling

7727
06:52:00,180 --> 06:52:01,180
Did you take this correctly

7728
06:52:01,180 --> 06:52:02,180
Or did you take it so fast

7729
06:52:02,180 --> 06:52:03,180
You didn't

7730
06:52:03,180 --> 06:52:04,180
You didn't check

7731
06:52:04,180 --> 06:52:05,180
Your spell

7732
06:52:05,180 --> 06:52:06,180
And now I can't read it

7733
06:52:06,180 --> 06:52:07,180
Because I'm too dumb

7734
06:52:09,180 --> 06:52:10,180
Women are EP girls

7735
06:52:10,180 --> 06:52:11,180
I can't believe it

7736
06:52:11,180 --> 06:52:12,180
Someone said

7737
06:52:12,180 --> 06:52:13,180
Plop plop plop plop

7738
06:52:13,180 --> 06:52:14,180
Get pregnant

7739
06:52:14,180 --> 06:52:15,180
Get pregnant

7740
06:52:15,180 --> 06:52:16,180
Get pregnant

7741
06:52:16,180 --> 06:52:17,180
Yeah, you want gen two?

7742
06:52:19,180 --> 06:52:20,180
Johnny

7743
06:52:20,180 --> 06:52:21,180
I can't wait to be permanently

7744
06:52:21,180 --> 06:52:22,180
Under your influence

7745
06:52:22,180 --> 06:52:23,180
Oh wait, I already am

7746
06:52:23,180 --> 06:52:24,180
Under your influence

7747
06:52:24,180 --> 06:52:25,180
I can't get over this trance

7748
06:52:25,180 --> 06:52:26,180
Love you mumme

7749
06:52:26,180 --> 06:52:27,180
Love you refling

7750
06:52:29,180 --> 06:52:30,180
Someone says

7751
06:52:30,180 --> 06:52:31,180
I want you

7752
06:52:32,180 --> 06:52:33,180
Good thing I'm ovulating

7753
06:52:33,180 --> 06:52:34,180
I want you too

7754
06:52:34,180 --> 06:52:35,180
Refling

7755
06:52:43,180 --> 06:52:44,180
On your my fire

7756
06:52:44,180 --> 06:52:45,180
It's gone

7757
06:52:45,180 --> 06:52:46,180
I distracted the refling

7758
06:52:46,180 --> 06:52:47,180
So much we forgot

7759
06:52:47,180 --> 06:52:48,180
To keep up the fire

7760
06:52:49,180 --> 06:52:50,180
Thank you for the fire

7761
06:52:52,180 --> 06:52:53,180
GGs

7762
06:52:53,180 --> 06:52:54,180
That'll be well lasted

7763
06:52:56,180 --> 06:52:57,180
Even the runescaper

7764
06:52:57,180 --> 06:52:58,180
Is there one handed right now

7765
06:53:00,180 --> 06:53:01,180
Why do you stream at 4am

7766
06:53:01,180 --> 06:53:02,180
And why is this the time

7767
06:53:02,180 --> 06:53:03,180
You wake up to stream

7768
06:53:03,180 --> 06:53:04,180
Is it just a spay

7769
06:53:04,180 --> 06:53:05,180
Be in particular

7770
06:53:06,180 --> 06:53:07,180
No

7771
06:53:07,180 --> 06:53:08,180
Also thoughts on Aussie

7772
06:53:08,180 --> 06:53:09,180
AFL

7773
06:53:09,180 --> 06:53:10,180
Very violent

7774
06:53:10,180 --> 06:53:11,180
Very violent

7775
06:53:12,180 --> 06:53:13,180
I've seen some slaps

7776
06:53:13,180 --> 06:53:14,180
I've seen some slaps

7777
06:53:14,180 --> 06:53:15,180
I've seen some slaps

7778
06:53:15,180 --> 06:53:16,180
I've seen some slaps

7779
06:53:17,180 --> 06:53:18,180
I've seen some slow mo

7780
06:53:18,180 --> 06:53:19,180
Nox

7781
06:53:19,180 --> 06:53:20,180
Or the AFL

7782
06:53:20,180 --> 06:53:21,180
It's pretty scary

7783
06:53:21,180 --> 06:53:22,180
I want to go see a match

7784
06:53:22,180 --> 06:53:23,180
Like in person

7785
06:53:23,180 --> 06:53:24,180
Just to be like

7786
06:53:25,180 --> 06:53:26,180
I'm a real Australian citizen

7787
06:53:27,180 --> 06:53:28,180
Wink wink

7788
06:53:29,180 --> 06:53:30,180
Why do you stream at 4am

7789
06:53:31,180 --> 06:53:32,180
I stream at 4am

7790
06:53:33,180 --> 06:53:34,180
Because I'm normally

7791
06:53:34,180 --> 06:53:35,180
An endurance strummer

7792
06:53:36,180 --> 06:53:37,180
Wait, I'm not cooking anymore

7793
06:53:38,180 --> 06:53:39,180
And

7794
06:53:41,180 --> 06:53:43,180
If I need to go to a doctor's appointment

7795
06:53:43,180 --> 06:53:44,180
Or if I need

7796
06:53:44,180 --> 06:53:45,180
No DOOM

7797
06:53:45,180 --> 06:53:46,180
No DOOM

7798
06:53:46,180 --> 06:53:47,180
Refling

7799
06:53:48,180 --> 06:53:49,180
Or I need to

7800
06:53:49,180 --> 06:53:50,180
You know, go shopping

7801
06:53:50,180 --> 06:53:52,180
Or I need to go

7802
06:53:53,180 --> 06:53:55,180
See my Chinese grandma

7803
06:53:55,180 --> 06:53:56,180
At the shop

7804
06:53:56,180 --> 06:53:57,180
I look squid in mirror right now

7805
06:53:57,180 --> 06:53:58,180
Wah!

7806
06:54:01,180 --> 06:54:02,180
Oh, Brian doesn't read it out

7807
06:54:02,180 --> 06:54:03,180
Don't worry, I'll read it out

7808
06:54:04,180 --> 06:54:06,180
KFP Spidey says

7809
06:54:06,180 --> 06:54:08,180
Thank you for the stream so far

7810
06:54:08,180 --> 06:54:09,180
It's been great listening

7811
06:54:09,180 --> 06:54:11,180
While I pack for my move

7812
06:54:11,180 --> 06:54:13,180
I was also the red guy

7813
06:54:13,180 --> 06:54:15,180
Dancing at the saddle too

7814
06:54:16,180 --> 06:54:17,180
Thank you, Brian

7815
06:54:18,180 --> 06:54:19,180
And thank you

7816
06:54:19,180 --> 06:54:20,180
KFP Spidey

7817
06:54:20,180 --> 06:54:21,180
For the five

7818
06:54:21,180 --> 06:54:22,180
I appreciate it

7819
06:54:22,180 --> 06:54:24,180
I'm sorry, I can't do Brian's voice

7820
06:54:26,180 --> 06:54:27,180
I'm so sorry

7821
06:54:27,180 --> 06:54:28,180
I tried my best

7822
06:54:31,180 --> 06:54:32,180
My sister

7823
06:54:32,180 --> 06:54:33,180
Pleased in the AFL

7824
06:54:33,180 --> 06:54:35,180
She's messed up with a bump

7825
06:54:35,180 --> 06:54:36,180
She too

7826
06:54:36,180 --> 06:54:37,180
It is so dangerous

7827
06:54:37,180 --> 06:54:38,180
Like the head trauma

7828
06:54:38,180 --> 06:54:39,180
You can get

7829
06:54:39,180 --> 06:54:40,180
Or like cauliflower ears

7830
06:54:40,180 --> 06:54:41,180
If you get blunt force

7831
06:54:41,180 --> 06:54:43,180
Trama to your ears by the way

7832
06:54:43,180 --> 06:54:45,180
You get a condition called

7833
06:54:45,180 --> 06:54:46,180
Cauliflower ears

7834
06:54:46,180 --> 06:54:47,180
Where they like spike up

7835
06:54:47,180 --> 06:54:48,180
Spike up?

7836
06:54:48,180 --> 06:54:49,180
Did he spike up?

7837
06:54:49,180 --> 06:54:50,180
Is that right?

7838
06:54:52,180 --> 06:54:53,180
But yeah, thank you so much

7839
06:54:53,180 --> 06:54:55,180
But please do not feel forced

7840
06:54:55,180 --> 06:54:56,180
To hang about

7841
06:54:56,180 --> 06:54:57,180
If you're getting a bit tired

7842
06:54:57,180 --> 06:54:59,180
Azura Dooley is currently playing

7843
06:54:59,180 --> 06:55:00,180
Meow

7844
06:55:02,180 --> 06:55:03,180
Meow

7845
06:55:03,180 --> 06:55:04,180
A bit of stray

7846
06:55:04,180 --> 06:55:05,180
A bit of meow

7847
06:55:06,180 --> 06:55:07,180
Oh wait

7848
06:55:07,180 --> 06:55:08,180
No, not on the ashes

7849
06:55:08,180 --> 06:55:09,180
On the fire

7850
06:55:10,180 --> 06:55:11,180
Don't be silly

7851
06:55:11,180 --> 06:55:12,180
Scottlefish

7852
06:55:15,180 --> 06:55:17,180
What is Arsonist Rufland in?

7853
06:55:18,180 --> 06:55:19,180
The Wayne certainly helped

7854
06:55:19,180 --> 06:55:20,180
With the burn rate

7855
06:55:21,180 --> 06:55:23,180
Down to 13.7

7856
06:55:24,180 --> 06:55:26,180
Actually, yeah, you're right

7857
06:55:26,180 --> 06:55:27,180
I thought you were a meme in there

7858
06:55:27,180 --> 06:55:28,180
You said that

7859
06:55:29,180 --> 06:55:30,180
But no, I do not stream

7860
06:55:30,180 --> 06:55:32,180
At 4am to spay any Aussies

7861
06:55:33,180 --> 06:55:34,180
I do it because

7862
06:55:36,180 --> 06:55:38,180
I'm actually a knight

7863
06:55:38,180 --> 06:55:39,180
I will

7864
06:55:41,180 --> 06:55:42,180
Buy default

7865
06:55:43,180 --> 06:55:45,180
So it's actually quite helpful

7866
06:55:45,180 --> 06:55:47,180
That I stream at this time

7867
06:55:47,180 --> 06:55:49,180
If I were to stream at 10am

7868
06:55:49,180 --> 06:55:51,180
Because that was the other slot

7869
06:55:51,180 --> 06:55:52,180
Imagine being an Aussie at like

7870
06:55:52,180 --> 06:55:54,180
Oh no, shock of behaviour

7871
06:55:54,180 --> 06:55:56,180
Imagine getting granted citizenship

7872
06:55:56,180 --> 06:55:58,180
Wouldn't that be crazy?

7873
06:55:59,180 --> 06:56:00,180
Wouldn't that be crazy?

7874
06:56:00,180 --> 06:56:02,180
I say that as if I'm not going back to Scotland

7875
06:56:02,180 --> 06:56:03,180
You know that

7876
06:56:03,180 --> 06:56:05,180
Fuckin' spend how much money on that?

7877
06:56:05,180 --> 06:56:06,180
I'll say this again

7878
06:56:06,180 --> 06:56:08,180
If you ever want to run a business

7879
06:56:08,180 --> 06:56:09,180
And you're either

7880
06:56:09,180 --> 06:56:11,180
You can do it in the UK

7881
06:56:11,180 --> 06:56:12,180
Or you can do it in Aus

7882
06:56:12,180 --> 06:56:13,180
Do it in Aus

7883
06:56:13,180 --> 06:56:14,180
You will make

7884
06:56:14,180 --> 06:56:15,180
You will get to keep a lot more

7885
06:56:15,180 --> 06:56:16,180
Of your money

7886
06:56:16,180 --> 06:56:18,180
Because of tax purposes

7887
06:56:18,180 --> 06:56:20,180
If you set it up in the UK

7888
06:56:20,180 --> 06:56:21,180
You're just

7889
06:56:21,180 --> 06:56:23,180
Getting absolutely blasted

7890
06:56:27,180 --> 06:56:28,180
Brian should now work

7891
06:56:28,180 --> 06:56:29,180
On those super chats

7892
06:56:29,180 --> 06:56:30,180
If you want to replay

7893
06:56:30,180 --> 06:56:31,180
Wait, hold on

7894
06:56:31,180 --> 06:56:32,180
Can I replay?

7895
06:56:33,180 --> 06:56:35,180
Thanks for the stream so far

7896
06:56:35,180 --> 06:56:36,180
It's been great listening

7897
06:56:36,180 --> 06:56:38,180
While I've had it for my move

7898
06:56:38,180 --> 06:56:40,180
I was also the red guy dancing

7899
06:56:40,180 --> 06:56:41,180
At the start of the stream

7900
06:56:41,180 --> 06:56:43,180
Yay, Brian works though

7901
06:56:43,180 --> 06:56:44,180
Okay, I do apologize

7902
06:56:44,180 --> 06:56:46,180
To any super chatters who didn't

7903
06:56:46,180 --> 06:56:47,180
Wait, hold on

7904
06:56:47,180 --> 06:56:48,180
Wait, I can replay the super chats

7905
06:56:48,180 --> 06:56:49,180
Are you squinting me?

7906
06:56:49,180 --> 06:56:51,180
I love Stronee as my mommy wife

7907
06:56:51,180 --> 06:56:53,180
And she has boing bully

7908
06:56:56,180 --> 06:56:57,180
I wear her

7909
06:56:57,180 --> 06:56:59,180
Okay, these are replays

7910
06:56:59,180 --> 06:57:00,180
Wait, what?

7911
06:57:00,180 --> 06:57:02,180
Are you squinting me right now?

7912
06:57:03,180 --> 06:57:05,180
I love Stronee as my mommy wife

7913
06:57:05,180 --> 06:57:07,180
And she has boing bully

7914
06:57:07,180 --> 06:57:08,180
And she has boing boing

7915
06:57:08,180 --> 06:57:10,180
She has boing boing

7916
06:57:11,180 --> 06:57:13,180
Thank you, Brian, for your...

7917
06:57:15,180 --> 06:57:16,180
Oh, no

7918
06:57:16,180 --> 06:57:18,180
Is camp log refling gone?

7919
06:57:19,180 --> 06:57:20,180
Paramount camp log?

7920
06:57:20,180 --> 06:57:21,180
I can't believe it

7921
06:57:21,180 --> 06:57:23,180
I can't believe

7922
06:57:23,180 --> 06:57:25,180
My poor refling has things to do

7923
06:57:27,180 --> 06:57:29,180
Do you have a VR headset?

7924
06:57:29,180 --> 06:57:30,180
I don't

7925
06:57:30,180 --> 06:57:31,180
Not yet

7926
06:57:31,180 --> 06:57:32,180
It might be plausible

7927
06:57:32,180 --> 06:57:33,180
I'll be getting one

7928
06:57:33,180 --> 06:57:35,180
Because I think...

7929
06:57:39,180 --> 06:57:40,180
75?

7930
06:57:40,180 --> 06:57:41,180
Oh, my God

7931
06:57:41,180 --> 06:57:43,180
Members can now cook

7932
06:57:43,180 --> 06:57:44,180
Rock-aids fish

7933
06:57:44,180 --> 06:57:45,180
And

7934
06:57:46,180 --> 06:57:47,180
Bats

7935
06:57:47,180 --> 06:57:49,180
Are you squinting me right now?

7936
06:57:50,180 --> 06:57:52,180
Guess who's back, Stronee?

7937
06:57:52,180 --> 06:57:53,180
It's me

7938
06:57:53,180 --> 06:57:55,180
How are things going here?

7939
06:57:55,180 --> 06:57:57,180
I'm level 30

7940
06:57:57,180 --> 06:57:58,180
75

7941
06:57:58,180 --> 06:58:00,180
Sorry, I have numbered dyslexia

7942
06:58:02,180 --> 06:58:04,180
I was going so well

7943
06:58:05,180 --> 06:58:06,180
I'm at 75

7944
06:58:09,180 --> 06:58:10,180
Jack

7945
06:58:10,180 --> 06:58:12,180
Thank you for the two

7946
06:58:13,180 --> 06:58:14,180
I appreciate it

7947
06:58:14,180 --> 06:58:16,180
Wait, where the heck did that one go?

7948
06:58:18,180 --> 06:58:20,180
And tiny spain-ee

7949
06:58:21,180 --> 06:58:22,180
Tiny spain-ee

7950
06:58:23,180 --> 06:58:24,180
Thank you

7951
06:58:24,180 --> 06:58:25,180
For the...

7952
06:58:25,180 --> 06:58:26,180
Sorry, I'm a bit...

7953
06:58:26,180 --> 06:58:27,180
I'm not flustered

7954
06:58:27,180 --> 06:58:28,180
That's the wrong...

7955
06:58:28,180 --> 06:58:30,180
I'm just eating food at the bank

7956
06:58:30,180 --> 06:58:31,180
Sorry

7957
06:58:31,180 --> 06:58:32,180
I'm not flustered

7958
06:58:32,180 --> 06:58:35,180
I don't know why my brain is telling me to shut down

7959
06:58:35,180 --> 06:58:36,180
Right now

7960
06:58:36,180 --> 06:58:38,180
I'm literally in the middle

7961
06:58:38,180 --> 06:58:39,180
I'm like, I'm...

7962
06:58:39,180 --> 06:58:40,180
Can you not?

7963
06:58:40,180 --> 06:58:41,180
I'll tell you what

7964
06:58:41,180 --> 06:58:42,180
I'll order food

7965
06:58:43,180 --> 06:58:44,180
I'll order food

7966
06:58:44,180 --> 06:58:47,180
And then I will automatically stay up for that food

7967
06:58:47,180 --> 06:58:48,180
Because I'm like...

7968
06:58:49,180 --> 06:58:50,180
By the way, this is...

7969
06:58:53,180 --> 06:58:54,180
Oh, my God

7970
06:58:54,180 --> 06:58:56,180
I'm gonna say this in stream

7971
06:58:57,180 --> 06:58:59,180
The scriptmaster has just messaged me this

7972
06:59:01,180 --> 06:59:03,180
If I write something about Brocon

7973
06:59:03,180 --> 06:59:04,180
But

7974
06:59:04,180 --> 06:59:07,180
They do not specifically say Big Bro or Sis

7975
06:59:07,180 --> 06:59:08,180
But

7976
06:59:08,180 --> 06:59:09,180
Wait, what?

7977
06:59:09,180 --> 06:59:10,180
Or Big Bro

7978
06:59:10,180 --> 06:59:12,180
But make reference to the same...

7979
06:59:13,180 --> 06:59:14,180
Mother

7980
06:59:14,180 --> 06:59:15,180
Is that against the rules?

7981
06:59:15,180 --> 06:59:16,180
Yes, you can't say that

7982
06:59:16,180 --> 06:59:17,180
Yes

7983
06:59:17,180 --> 06:59:19,180
You can't say that

7984
06:59:20,180 --> 06:59:22,180
Try rephrasing, please

7985
06:59:24,180 --> 06:59:26,180
Don't worry, the scriptmaster has your back

7986
06:59:26,180 --> 06:59:27,180
That's all I'm saying

7987
06:59:27,180 --> 06:59:29,180
He knows the interests of the pinpals

7988
06:59:29,180 --> 06:59:31,180
And we're gonna try our best to...

7989
06:59:32,180 --> 06:59:33,180
Be up at port

7990
06:59:35,180 --> 06:59:36,180
But there you go

7991
06:59:38,180 --> 06:59:40,180
Strani, what if you want to get comfy in bed

7992
06:59:40,180 --> 06:59:41,180
And then get...

7993
06:59:41,180 --> 06:59:42,180
Oh, my God

7994
06:59:42,180 --> 06:59:44,180
Are you seeing that meme that's like

7995
06:59:44,180 --> 06:59:45,180
When you're...

7996
06:59:45,180 --> 06:59:46,180
What's it?

7997
06:59:46,180 --> 06:59:48,180
When your sushi roll is sad

7998
06:59:48,180 --> 06:59:50,180
Just take your sushi roll

7999
06:59:50,180 --> 06:59:51,180
And

8000
06:59:51,180 --> 06:59:53,180
Deer her down

8001
06:59:55,180 --> 06:59:56,180
Base script...

8002
06:59:56,180 --> 06:59:58,180
Bro, the script quality is gonna like

8003
06:59:58,180 --> 06:59:59,180
Go up dramatically

8004
06:59:59,180 --> 07:00:01,180
After the three month mark

8005
07:00:01,180 --> 07:00:03,180
You're gonna know when the scriptmaster came into play

8006
07:00:03,180 --> 07:00:05,180
Because you can tell it's like

8007
07:00:05,180 --> 07:00:07,180
Not me writing that shit anymore

8008
07:00:07,180 --> 07:00:10,180
You're like, oh, God, finally, Strani's not doing it anymore

8009
07:00:11,180 --> 07:00:14,180
I say that as if I'm not writing all my own stuff

8010
07:00:14,180 --> 07:00:16,180
But I want to write my own stuff

8011
07:00:16,180 --> 07:00:17,180
Because I'm passionate about it

8012
07:00:17,180 --> 07:00:20,180
Not to say that scriptmaster isn't passionate

8013
07:00:20,180 --> 07:00:21,180
But I quite like writing my stuff

8014
07:00:21,180 --> 07:00:22,180
Because it feels...

8015
07:00:22,180 --> 07:00:24,180
It feels more intimate

8016
07:00:24,180 --> 07:00:27,180
When I can like do it between me and Beefling, you know

8017
07:00:27,180 --> 07:00:29,180
And we do it together

8018
07:00:29,180 --> 07:00:30,180
And I have you in mind

8019
07:00:30,180 --> 07:00:31,180
You are my muse, Beefling

8020
07:00:31,180 --> 07:00:32,180
You are my muse

8021
07:00:33,180 --> 07:00:35,180
Feed the fire for Mumme

8022
07:00:35,180 --> 07:00:37,180
Thank you

8023
07:00:41,180 --> 07:00:42,180
Oh, that's it

8024
07:00:42,180 --> 07:00:44,180
When your girlfriend is sad

8025
07:00:44,180 --> 07:00:45,180
Lira in a blanket

8026
07:00:45,180 --> 07:00:46,180
A ruler

8027
07:00:46,180 --> 07:00:47,180
Yeah, yeah, yeah

8028
07:00:47,180 --> 07:00:48,180
That's the one

8029
07:00:48,180 --> 07:00:50,180
Sometimes it's nice being a little bro

8030
07:00:50,180 --> 07:00:52,180
Well, little bros are for zero

8031
07:00:52,180 --> 07:00:54,180
Big bros in me

8032
07:00:58,180 --> 07:01:00,180
Yours are exceptionally good

8033
07:01:00,180 --> 07:01:01,180
Aw, that's very kind

8034
07:01:01,180 --> 07:01:03,180
I like...

8035
07:01:03,180 --> 07:01:05,180
I did have the option to hand over

8036
07:01:05,180 --> 07:01:07,180
My scripts to someone else

8037
07:01:07,180 --> 07:01:10,180
But I like doing it between us

8038
07:01:10,180 --> 07:01:12,180
Really need this fire

8039
07:01:12,180 --> 07:01:14,180
Making XP for real, for real

8040
07:01:17,180 --> 07:01:19,180
I imagine you and the other girls

8041
07:01:19,180 --> 07:01:20,180
Write their own stuff

8042
07:01:20,180 --> 07:01:23,180
There was a handful of girls

8043
07:01:23,180 --> 07:01:25,180
Who wanted to give their hand at it

8044
07:01:25,180 --> 07:01:27,180
I absolutely did not expect it

8045
07:01:27,180 --> 07:01:30,180
Because it's just more time

8046
07:01:30,180 --> 07:01:32,180
And I don't want the girls like

8047
07:01:32,180 --> 07:01:34,180
Stressing out over that kind of thing

8048
07:01:37,180 --> 07:01:38,180
But yeah

8049
07:01:41,180 --> 07:01:43,180
I just don't want to stress the girls out

8050
07:01:43,180 --> 07:01:46,180
If they want to do it of their own violation

8051
07:01:46,180 --> 07:01:48,180
Violition? Violition?

8052
07:01:48,180 --> 07:01:50,180
Then that's perfect

8053
07:01:50,180 --> 07:01:52,180
Did I just hear them?

8054
07:01:56,180 --> 07:01:57,180
I guess she's not happy

8055
07:01:57,180 --> 07:01:59,180
I fed her

8056
07:01:59,180 --> 07:02:00,180
Oh well

8057
07:02:02,180 --> 07:02:04,180
Day 10 of eating celery daily

8058
07:02:04,180 --> 07:02:05,180
It's so bad

8059
07:02:05,180 --> 07:02:07,180
Oh no, don't put yourself through

8060
07:02:07,180 --> 07:02:08,180
Celery for that

8061
07:02:08,180 --> 07:02:10,180
Celery is nasty

8062
07:02:10,180 --> 07:02:11,180
I've never enjoyed it

8063
07:02:11,180 --> 07:02:12,180
I'm sorry

8064
07:02:12,180 --> 07:02:14,180
Doesn't matter how much humus

8065
07:02:14,180 --> 07:02:15,180
You put on it

8066
07:02:15,180 --> 07:02:17,180
Violition? Violition?

8067
07:02:17,180 --> 07:02:19,180
Did I just say it funny?

8068
07:02:19,180 --> 07:02:20,180
Volition

8069
07:02:20,180 --> 07:02:21,180
Volition!

8070
07:02:21,180 --> 07:02:22,180
There's no I

8071
07:02:22,180 --> 07:02:23,180
Okay, we're getting there

8072
07:02:23,180 --> 07:02:25,180
Stopped to fluster us

8073
07:02:25,180 --> 07:02:26,180
Exactly

8074
07:02:29,180 --> 07:02:30,180
Oh my goodness

8075
07:02:31,180 --> 07:02:32,180
Violation

8076
07:02:32,180 --> 07:02:34,180
Oh no, now you're getting me confused

8077
07:02:35,180 --> 07:02:37,180
Yeah, I love your scripts

8078
07:02:37,180 --> 07:02:38,180
On Patreon Strony

8079
07:02:38,180 --> 07:02:40,180
Thank you!

8080
07:02:40,180 --> 07:02:43,180
I did them off the top of my head myself

8081
07:02:47,180 --> 07:02:49,180
I'll be very curious to see

8082
07:02:49,180 --> 07:02:51,180
What the donathon results in

8083
07:02:51,180 --> 07:02:52,180
I have

8084
07:02:52,180 --> 07:02:56,180
I imagine the week after the donathon concludes

8085
07:02:56,180 --> 07:02:58,180
I will be having very short streams

8086
07:02:58,180 --> 07:03:01,180
So I can focus on the rewards one at a time

8087
07:03:01,180 --> 07:03:05,180
I know some agencies had a bit of problems

8088
07:03:05,180 --> 07:03:08,180
Trying to handle streaming and getting rewards out

8089
07:03:08,180 --> 07:03:12,180
Obviously, because I'm such an unbelievable

8090
07:03:12,180 --> 07:03:15,180
Bad workaholic or good however you want to

8091
07:03:15,180 --> 07:03:18,180
Good for people who like content, content, content

8092
07:03:18,180 --> 07:03:22,180
Bad for the actual workaholic themselves

8093
07:03:22,180 --> 07:03:24,180
Because they just non-stop keep going

8094
07:03:24,180 --> 07:03:28,180
But I think I definitely am in a position where

8095
07:03:28,180 --> 07:03:31,180
I can get stuff out relatively quick

8096
07:03:31,180 --> 07:03:35,180
Whether that be an audio, a collab audio

8097
07:03:37,180 --> 07:03:38,180
Yeah

8098
07:03:39,180 --> 07:03:41,180
Maybe those are good if you want your money from birds

8099
07:03:41,180 --> 07:03:46,180
I have a huge backlog of willow logs from doing forest streams

8100
07:03:46,180 --> 07:03:48,180
Short streams, like 10 hours instead of 12

8101
07:03:50,180 --> 07:03:53,180
For me, a short stream is 2 hours

8102
07:03:53,180 --> 07:03:54,180
Which I think someone said

8103
07:03:54,180 --> 07:03:56,180
That's literally what the regular stream time is

8104
07:03:56,180 --> 07:03:58,180
For the average YouTuber

8105
07:03:58,180 --> 07:03:59,180
And I'm like

8106
07:04:00,180 --> 07:04:03,180
2 hours is me doing stuff in the background

8107
07:04:03,180 --> 07:04:05,180
I'm not being funny

8108
07:04:07,180 --> 07:04:09,180
If you look and you see I've done a 2 hour stream

8109
07:04:09,180 --> 07:04:10,180
And nothing else that day

8110
07:04:10,180 --> 07:04:13,180
That means I am doing so much work in the background

8111
07:04:14,180 --> 07:04:15,180
Type thing

8112
07:04:16,180 --> 07:04:18,180
Is that these strony culls?

8113
07:04:19,180 --> 07:04:21,180
There's only one of them in this world baby

8114
07:04:23,180 --> 07:04:25,180
Time to cook through my 3k swordfish

8115
07:04:25,180 --> 07:04:28,180
Literally that's what I'm doing

8116
07:04:28,180 --> 07:04:29,180
Just getting through it

8117
07:04:30,180 --> 07:04:34,180
It takes her 2 hours just to start playing the lamo

8118
07:04:37,180 --> 07:04:38,180
Management got me there

8119
07:04:38,180 --> 07:04:39,180
Hydration check

8120
07:04:46,180 --> 07:04:47,180
Hi strony

8121
07:04:47,180 --> 07:04:48,180
In the most loving way possible

8122
07:04:48,180 --> 07:04:51,180
I want to bury my face in your butt until you pass out

8123
07:04:51,180 --> 07:04:53,180
While you hmmm yourself

8124
07:04:53,180 --> 07:04:54,180
You're too hot

8125
07:04:56,180 --> 07:04:59,180
Just your gentle talk is enough to get me going sometimes

8126
07:04:59,180 --> 07:05:00,180
When you talk about other hot things

8127
07:05:00,180 --> 07:05:02,180
I need a moment to calm down

8128
07:05:02,180 --> 07:05:03,180
Oh my god Rythme

8129
07:05:04,180 --> 07:05:06,180
Got me blushing and shit

8130
07:05:06,180 --> 07:05:07,180
Stop

8131
07:05:08,180 --> 07:05:10,180
I'm glad I have that control of you

8132
07:05:11,180 --> 07:05:12,180
That power

8133
07:05:13,180 --> 07:05:15,180
Makes me very happy

8134
07:05:17,180 --> 07:05:18,180
I'm a bit too happy

8135
07:05:18,180 --> 07:05:20,180
I think I take a little bit too much

8136
07:05:21,180 --> 07:05:23,180
Pleasure from such a thing

8137
07:05:23,180 --> 07:05:25,180
Is that terrible?

8138
07:05:29,180 --> 07:05:31,180
I'm sure do have powers

8139
07:05:31,180 --> 07:05:32,180
Terrorist to boot up

8140
07:05:32,180 --> 07:05:33,180
What is this a Windows 95?

8141
07:05:33,180 --> 07:05:35,180
No cause I want to stop yapping

8142
07:05:38,180 --> 07:05:39,180
I love to eat sushi

8143
07:05:39,180 --> 07:05:41,180
I could do it for hours

8144
07:05:41,180 --> 07:05:42,180
Oh yeah

8145
07:05:44,180 --> 07:05:45,180
Is that because I'm a cutlery?

8146
07:05:47,180 --> 07:05:50,180
Oh I keep wanting to freakin make that

8147
07:05:50,180 --> 07:05:52,180
What does your Oshii smell like meme?

8148
07:05:53,180 --> 07:05:54,180
Because

8149
07:05:55,180 --> 07:05:57,180
The reason is

8150
07:05:59,180 --> 07:06:00,180
What's the reason?

8151
07:06:01,180 --> 07:06:04,180
Oh because I use a lemon scented soap

8152
07:06:04,180 --> 07:06:06,180
I wanted to post it and be like

8153
07:06:06,180 --> 07:06:08,180
This cutlery comes pre-seasoned

8154
07:06:09,180 --> 07:06:12,180
And then I think there's only one other girl that needs to do it

8155
07:06:12,180 --> 07:06:15,180
And then everyone knows what the whole revealer smells like

8156
07:06:16,180 --> 07:06:18,180
6,000 subscribers reached

8157
07:06:19,180 --> 07:06:20,180
What?

8158
07:06:20,180 --> 07:06:22,180
We celebrated 5k

8159
07:06:25,180 --> 07:06:27,180
Oh my gosh

8160
07:06:27,180 --> 07:06:28,180
Fish

8161
07:06:34,180 --> 07:06:35,180
Ah

8162
07:06:44,180 --> 07:06:45,180
What?

8163
07:06:47,180 --> 07:06:49,180
I'm really excited

8164
07:06:58,180 --> 07:07:03,180
Why is it getting so hot?

8165
07:07:04,180 --> 07:07:06,180
I'm so confused

8166
07:07:06,180 --> 07:07:08,180
It shouldn't have been

8167
07:07:08,180 --> 07:07:10,180
Statistically yet

8168
07:07:10,180 --> 07:07:13,180
It should have only been pushed to 5k people

8169
07:07:13,180 --> 07:07:14,180
It's bizarre

8170
07:07:14,180 --> 07:07:16,180
I didn't expect that at all

8171
07:07:16,180 --> 07:07:18,180
Are you squiddling me right now?

8172
07:07:18,180 --> 07:07:19,180
Yeah

8173
07:07:24,180 --> 07:07:26,180
Thank you for the tip

8174
07:07:26,180 --> 07:07:28,180
Milk Cadmus

8175
07:07:29,180 --> 07:07:31,180
Any milk cadmets?

8176
07:07:31,180 --> 07:07:33,180
Thank you for saying it

8177
07:07:33,180 --> 07:07:34,180
I'm so confused

8178
07:07:34,180 --> 07:07:36,180
I'm like daddy you make a tweet and be like

8179
07:07:36,180 --> 07:07:38,180
I can't believe it but under 24 hours

8180
07:07:40,180 --> 07:07:43,180
The one thing, I've mentioned this in another stream

8181
07:07:43,180 --> 07:07:48,180
The one thing I do not like about being a VTuber in this context

8182
07:07:48,180 --> 07:07:51,180
Is you have to play the numbered games

8183
07:07:51,180 --> 07:07:53,180
And you have to play the

8184
07:07:53,180 --> 07:07:56,180
Oh thank you for this

8185
07:07:58,180 --> 07:08:01,180
In terms of milestones

8186
07:08:02,180 --> 07:08:05,180
And it's a hard one to navigate

8187
07:08:05,180 --> 07:08:08,180
Because if you don't say thank you thank you

8188
07:08:08,180 --> 07:08:11,180
You look almost ungrateful

8189
07:08:11,180 --> 07:08:14,180
But if you do say thank you thank you

8190
07:08:14,180 --> 07:08:17,180
It looks like you're counting and waiting for the next milestone

8191
07:08:17,180 --> 07:08:19,180
Just so you can spam thank you thank you

8192
07:08:20,180 --> 07:08:23,180
You don't have to say thank you

8193
07:08:23,180 --> 07:08:25,180
Well the problem is

8194
07:08:25,180 --> 07:08:28,180
I'm trying to get like

8195
07:08:28,180 --> 07:08:30,180
Gratis on 6k a moment

8196
07:08:30,180 --> 07:08:32,180
Thank you Luthe Reefling

8197
07:08:33,180 --> 07:08:34,180
The thing is

8198
07:08:34,180 --> 07:08:37,180
It would be really good to get on VTuber news

8199
07:08:37,180 --> 07:08:39,180
Or any kind of source like that

8200
07:08:39,180 --> 07:08:42,180
Because it brings more attention to the girls in general

8201
07:08:43,180 --> 07:08:46,180
Which is why it's like

8202
07:08:47,180 --> 07:08:50,180
I don't want people thinking I'm counting

8203
07:08:50,180 --> 07:08:55,180
But what I'm thinking about is the probability

8204
07:08:55,180 --> 07:08:58,180
That it could gain new eyes to the girls

8205
07:08:58,180 --> 07:09:00,180
Because I want nothing for them to succeed

8206
07:09:00,180 --> 07:09:02,180
I've got everything I want right here

8207
07:09:02,180 --> 07:09:03,180
I've got my Reeflings

8208
07:09:03,180 --> 07:09:04,180
We're freaking meman

8209
07:09:04,180 --> 07:09:06,180
We've got member streams

8210
07:09:06,180 --> 07:09:07,180
We've got multiplayer games

8211
07:09:07,180 --> 07:09:09,180
We've got ASMR

8212
07:09:09,180 --> 07:09:10,180
The Wazoo coming out

8213
07:09:10,180 --> 07:09:11,180
I've got collabs of other VTubers

8214
07:09:11,180 --> 07:09:13,180
That are willing to interact with me

8215
07:09:13,180 --> 07:09:15,180
Like I've got everything I need

8216
07:09:15,180 --> 07:09:17,180
I'm so freaking happy

8217
07:09:17,180 --> 07:09:20,180
I want the girls to achieve their dreams

8218
07:09:20,180 --> 07:09:23,180
And the truth of them achieving their dreams

8219
07:09:23,180 --> 07:09:25,180
Is one to have enough money to be a content creator

8220
07:09:25,180 --> 07:09:27,180
Some of them are looking to move out

8221
07:09:27,180 --> 07:09:30,180
Some of them are looking for upgrade equipments on their own

8222
07:09:32,180 --> 07:09:34,180
You know, Emmie was fantastic

8223
07:09:34,180 --> 07:09:36,180
She's already designed her 2.0 model

8224
07:09:36,180 --> 07:09:38,180
Because it feels more like her

8225
07:09:39,180 --> 07:09:41,180
That kind of thing

8226
07:09:41,180 --> 07:09:42,180
I want the girls to have it

8227
07:09:42,180 --> 07:09:44,180
Some of them wanted 3D models

8228
07:09:44,180 --> 07:09:46,180
I wanted them to get it

8229
07:09:46,180 --> 07:09:49,180
And the truth of the matter is

8230
07:09:49,180 --> 07:09:51,180
In order to get these things

8231
07:09:51,180 --> 07:09:54,180
There needs to be eyes on the girls

8232
07:09:54,180 --> 07:09:59,180
So I can help them achieve their 3D goals and stuff

8233
07:09:59,180 --> 07:10:00,180
Although someone said that

8234
07:10:00,180 --> 07:10:03,180
Someone was like, what do you mean by the 3 year mark?

8235
07:10:03,180 --> 07:10:07,180
Whenever I mention the 3 year mark

8236
07:10:07,180 --> 07:10:09,180
Congrats to whoever leveled up there

8237
07:10:09,180 --> 07:10:12,180
Whenever I mention the 3 year mark

8238
07:10:12,180 --> 07:10:14,180
The reason I say 3 years

8239
07:10:14,180 --> 07:10:17,180
Is because statistically 3 years

8240
07:10:17,180 --> 07:10:19,180
And you're done

8241
07:10:19,180 --> 07:10:22,180
You're persona, you're whatever you want to call it

8242
07:10:22,180 --> 07:10:23,180
Emmie Bezos

8243
07:10:23,180 --> 07:10:26,180
Oh my god, you really look like Emmie as well in games

8244
07:10:28,180 --> 07:10:33,180
The reason why 3 years is this mysterious number

8245
07:10:33,180 --> 07:10:34,180
Placed on someone's head

8246
07:10:34,180 --> 07:10:36,180
Is because that statistically

8247
07:10:36,180 --> 07:10:38,180
If you do find success

8248
07:10:38,180 --> 07:10:40,180
By the third year

8249
07:10:40,180 --> 07:10:43,180
The success goes unless you make

8250
07:10:43,180 --> 07:10:46,180
You change your content up dramatically

8251
07:10:46,180 --> 07:10:48,180
And the reason I say 3 years

8252
07:10:48,180 --> 07:10:50,180
Is because

8253
07:10:50,180 --> 07:10:52,180
Before you're like wait

8254
07:10:52,180 --> 07:10:53,180
So Strongie's only got 3 years

8255
07:10:53,180 --> 07:10:55,180
Relax, stop doing it

8256
07:10:55,180 --> 07:10:58,180
Relax, no

8257
07:10:58,180 --> 07:11:00,180
No, that's not

8258
07:11:00,180 --> 07:11:04,180
It's very possible that Strongie and

8259
07:11:04,180 --> 07:11:06,180
Like once we're all satisfied

8260
07:11:06,180 --> 07:11:09,180
Like I won't stop until you guys are ready for me to stop

8261
07:11:09,180 --> 07:11:10,180
Like please don't

8262
07:11:10,180 --> 07:11:11,180
No, don't do it

8263
07:11:11,180 --> 07:11:14,180
But please don't think I'm just going to abruptly stop

8264
07:11:14,180 --> 07:11:15,180
Overnight

8265
07:11:15,180 --> 07:11:18,180
Like that's not the reality of the situation at all

8266
07:11:18,180 --> 07:11:20,180
It's very likely

8267
07:11:20,180 --> 07:11:23,180
I will want to focus on hypnosis

8268
07:11:23,180 --> 07:11:26,180
Audio is like way down the line

8269
07:11:26,180 --> 07:11:28,180
It's over

8270
07:11:28,180 --> 07:11:29,180
No, so never

8271
07:11:29,180 --> 07:11:30,180
No, if you don't want me to go

8272
07:11:30,180 --> 07:11:33,180
I'll be streaming in my little retirement home

8273
07:11:33,180 --> 07:11:35,180
Doing my thing

8274
07:11:35,180 --> 07:11:38,180
I've got an end in stamina

8275
07:11:38,180 --> 07:11:41,180
Like seriously this is

8276
07:11:41,180 --> 07:11:45,180
Just it took so long to get here

8277
07:11:45,180 --> 07:11:47,180
And everything worked out in the end

8278
07:11:47,180 --> 07:11:51,180
And it just feels so nice to be

8279
07:11:51,180 --> 07:11:54,180
I don't know, I just

8280
07:11:54,180 --> 07:11:57,180
Like to be accepted

8281
07:11:57,180 --> 07:11:59,180
To be just having fun

8282
07:11:59,180 --> 07:12:01,180
Folk want to hang out

8283
07:12:01,180 --> 07:12:02,180
It's just casual

8284
07:12:02,180 --> 07:12:04,180
It's none of this like

8285
07:12:04,180 --> 07:12:06,180
You know

8286
07:12:06,180 --> 07:12:08,180
Art say fart say like

8287
07:12:08,180 --> 07:12:12,180
Oh this VTuber is giggling their head off every two seconds

8288
07:12:12,180 --> 07:12:14,180
And this VTuber is like

8289
07:12:14,180 --> 07:12:15,180
Putting on this like

8290
07:12:15,180 --> 07:12:17,180
Horrifically fake personality

8291
07:12:17,180 --> 07:12:20,180
Pina, thank you for becoming a member

8292
07:12:20,180 --> 07:12:23,180
The first year is an introduction

8293
07:12:23,180 --> 07:12:26,180
The second is establishing and third is plateau

8294
07:12:26,180 --> 07:12:28,180
That is quite literally what it is

8295
07:12:28,180 --> 07:12:31,180
That is what most people experience

8296
07:12:31,180 --> 07:12:33,180
If you've ever been like

8297
07:12:33,180 --> 07:12:37,180
Why did that one in the VTuber

8298
07:12:37,180 --> 07:12:41,180
Go on a new account

8299
07:12:41,180 --> 07:12:44,180
That's basically remaking a persona

8300
07:12:44,180 --> 07:12:46,180
Because you plateau

8301
07:12:46,180 --> 07:12:48,180
And it's perfectly natural to plateau

8302
07:12:48,180 --> 07:12:51,180
There's no issue

8303
07:12:51,180 --> 07:12:53,180
Only 155 more

8304
07:12:55,180 --> 07:12:58,180
Thank you Peter Everingham

8305
07:12:58,180 --> 07:13:00,180
For becoming a member

8306
07:13:00,180 --> 07:13:01,180
I appreciate it

8307
07:13:01,180 --> 07:13:03,180
I'll be honest with you all for a sec

8308
07:13:03,180 --> 07:13:05,180
Let's see what's up

8309
07:13:05,180 --> 07:13:07,180
Question mark

8310
07:13:07,180 --> 07:13:09,180
What's up

8311
07:13:09,180 --> 07:13:12,180
Or does this refling share with us

8312
07:13:12,180 --> 07:13:14,180
We will

8313
07:13:14,180 --> 07:13:16,180
Strony until we die at 99

8314
07:13:16,180 --> 07:13:18,180
Because it's part of our little heart

8315
07:13:18,180 --> 07:13:19,180
I fart

8316
07:13:19,180 --> 07:13:21,180
Okay you're done refling

8317
07:13:22,180 --> 07:13:24,180
Deeply departed

8318
07:13:24,180 --> 07:13:26,180
He came and he farted

8319
07:13:27,180 --> 07:13:31,180
Damn you and people can't just do the same thing successfully

8320
07:13:31,180 --> 07:13:34,180
Without ever needing any variation in their content

8321
07:13:34,180 --> 07:13:36,180
I haven't seen examples of that before

8322
07:13:36,180 --> 07:13:37,180
Yes

8323
07:13:37,180 --> 07:13:40,180
I really like the behind the scenes psychology

8324
07:13:40,180 --> 07:13:42,180
About it all

8325
07:13:42,180 --> 07:13:44,180
Monster girls

8326
07:13:44,180 --> 07:13:45,180
Please

8327
07:13:45,180 --> 07:13:47,180
Thank you for becoming a member

8328
07:13:47,180 --> 07:13:50,180
Is that you asking for gen 2 designs to be monster girls

8329
07:13:50,180 --> 07:13:53,180
Oh boy you're in for a treat

8330
07:13:53,180 --> 07:13:55,180
Um

8331
07:13:55,180 --> 07:13:57,180
Yeah

8332
07:13:57,180 --> 07:14:01,180
There's been 2 designs that have been accepted

8333
07:14:01,180 --> 07:14:03,180
Lololololol

8334
07:14:03,180 --> 07:14:05,180
Um

8335
07:14:05,180 --> 07:14:08,180
Mods take some of his pennies

8336
07:14:08,180 --> 07:14:10,180
And scatter them across his home

8337
07:14:10,180 --> 07:14:12,180
Wait that's so specific

8338
07:14:13,180 --> 07:14:15,180
Oh I don't know

8339
07:14:15,180 --> 07:14:18,180
I feel like you feel happy streaming

8340
07:14:18,180 --> 07:14:20,180
I can see that

8341
07:14:20,180 --> 07:14:22,180
I can't imagine mome

8342
07:14:22,180 --> 07:14:24,180
Without this

8343
07:14:24,180 --> 07:14:26,180
There was obviously

8344
07:14:26,180 --> 07:14:29,180
Right actually I can tell you something behind the scenes

8345
07:14:29,180 --> 07:14:32,180
And you're not gonna like it but it's no longer the case

8346
07:14:32,180 --> 07:14:34,180
Because I got script manager in

8347
07:14:34,180 --> 07:14:36,180
If and when gen 2 came around

8348
07:14:36,180 --> 07:14:39,180
There was no way I could keep up with the daily streaming

8349
07:14:39,180 --> 07:14:42,180
And trying to organize all the script stuff

8350
07:14:42,180 --> 07:14:44,180
Um

8351
07:14:44,180 --> 07:14:47,180
But thank you to script master for coming into play

8352
07:14:47,180 --> 07:14:49,180
Because without them

8353
07:14:49,180 --> 07:14:51,180
Being there

8354
07:14:51,180 --> 07:14:53,180
With gen 2 starting

8355
07:14:53,180 --> 07:14:55,180
I probably couldn't daily stream

8356
07:14:55,180 --> 07:14:57,180
So

8357
07:14:57,180 --> 07:14:59,180
That's the honest truth

8358
07:14:59,180 --> 07:15:01,180
I was gonna stream my ass off for an entire year

8359
07:15:01,180 --> 07:15:03,180
Like non-stop back to back double streams

8360
07:15:03,180 --> 07:15:05,180
On some days doing like endurance this

8361
07:15:05,180 --> 07:15:07,180
Endurance that

8362
07:15:07,180 --> 07:15:09,180
But thankfully that's no longer the case

8363
07:15:09,180 --> 07:15:11,180
Um

8364
07:15:11,180 --> 07:15:13,180
Obviously

8365
07:15:13,180 --> 07:15:15,180
When

8366
07:15:15,180 --> 07:15:17,180
Gen 3 were to occur

8367
07:15:17,180 --> 07:15:19,180
That's a lot

8368
07:15:19,180 --> 07:15:21,180
Of girls to manage

8369
07:15:21,180 --> 07:15:23,180
And I'm not sure how realistic the daily streams

8370
07:15:23,180 --> 07:15:25,180
Will be at that point

8371
07:15:25,180 --> 07:15:27,180
Is my only concern

8372
07:15:27,180 --> 07:15:29,180
And the thing is none of us have a crystal ball

8373
07:15:29,180 --> 07:15:31,180
To look into the future

8374
07:15:31,180 --> 07:15:33,180
So I can't tell

8375
07:15:33,180 --> 07:15:35,180
By 0 by 0

8376
07:15:35,180 --> 07:15:37,180
By 0 every day is a blessing

8377
07:15:37,180 --> 07:15:39,180
No don't cry don't do him don't do him

8378
07:15:39,180 --> 07:15:41,180
We're not even there we've not even

8379
07:15:41,180 --> 07:15:43,180
We've not even got the first model of gen 2

8380
07:15:43,180 --> 07:15:45,180
Literally we have fucking 2 approved concepts

8381
07:15:45,180 --> 07:15:47,180
That's the

8382
07:15:47,180 --> 07:15:49,180
Don't burn out in spite

8383
07:15:49,180 --> 07:15:51,180
See that's the thing spite can get you very far

8384
07:15:51,180 --> 07:15:53,180
Maybe I will

8385
07:15:53,180 --> 07:15:55,180
Spite everyone and just say

8386
07:15:55,180 --> 07:15:57,180
I'll stream daily and you guys weren't ready for it

8387
07:15:57,180 --> 07:15:59,180
It's so jovert nyo

8388
07:15:59,180 --> 07:16:01,180
Less than 6kxp

8389
07:16:01,180 --> 07:16:03,180
For 80 million hp

8390
07:16:03,180 --> 07:16:05,180
And I'm just chillin here

8391
07:16:05,180 --> 07:16:07,180
Banned from shame

8392
07:16:07,180 --> 07:16:09,180
Braptuber allegations have not been been

8393
07:16:09,180 --> 07:16:11,180
No

8394
07:16:11,180 --> 07:16:13,180
The future in the game background is making me feel more

8395
07:16:13,180 --> 07:16:15,180
Okay no no no happy thoughts

8396
07:16:15,180 --> 07:16:17,180
Happy thoughts

8397
07:16:19,180 --> 07:16:21,180
If you can do this

8398
07:16:21,180 --> 07:16:23,180
In not even 2 weeks

8399
07:16:23,180 --> 07:16:25,180
I can't imagine what you're gonna do in a year

8400
07:16:25,180 --> 07:16:27,180
I mean

8401
07:16:27,180 --> 07:16:29,180
It's not really gonna change

8402
07:16:29,180 --> 07:16:31,180
Sorry

8403
07:16:31,180 --> 07:16:33,180
This is

8404
07:16:33,180 --> 07:16:35,180
Me having happy times

8405
07:16:35,180 --> 07:16:37,180
We do have some monthly events planned

8406
07:16:37,180 --> 07:16:39,180
Um

8407
07:16:39,180 --> 07:16:41,180
Type things

8408
07:16:41,180 --> 07:16:43,180
Going on got ASMR collabs planned

8409
07:16:43,180 --> 07:16:45,180
I think ASMR is like a bread and butter

8410
07:16:45,180 --> 07:16:47,180
Please

8411
07:16:47,180 --> 07:16:49,180
Please consider ASMR

8412
07:16:49,180 --> 07:16:51,180
As a bread and butter viewer

8413
07:16:51,180 --> 07:16:53,180
Some people kinda get annoyed when ASMR

8414
07:16:53,180 --> 07:16:55,180
At ASMR

8415
07:16:55,180 --> 07:16:57,180
VTubers dabble

8416
07:16:57,180 --> 07:16:59,180
In ASMR and don't always like commit to it

8417
07:16:59,180 --> 07:17:01,180
Fully but no it's bread and butter

8418
07:17:01,180 --> 07:17:03,180
I think everyone's gonna be participating in it

8419
07:17:03,180 --> 07:17:05,180
Juicily

8420
07:17:05,180 --> 07:17:07,180
Can you spit on us

8421
07:17:07,180 --> 07:17:09,180
Yeah you want me to spit all over your face

8422
07:17:11,180 --> 07:17:13,180
Open it

8423
07:17:13,180 --> 07:17:15,180
Open your mouth

8424
07:17:15,180 --> 07:17:17,180
Let me spit on your face

8425
07:17:17,180 --> 07:17:19,180
Um

8426
07:17:19,180 --> 07:17:21,180
Yeah don't

8427
07:17:21,180 --> 07:17:23,180
Don't worry like

8428
07:17:23,180 --> 07:17:25,180
Ah frickin you know how open and honest

8429
07:17:25,180 --> 07:17:27,180
I'm gonna tell you what it looks like

8430
07:17:27,180 --> 07:17:29,180
And what things are like and you know

8431
07:17:29,180 --> 07:17:31,180
People who do watch you can get little

8432
07:17:31,180 --> 07:17:33,180
Tip bits of information

8433
07:17:33,180 --> 07:17:35,180
Early access information

8434
07:17:35,180 --> 07:17:37,180
VTubers ASMR

8435
07:17:37,180 --> 07:17:39,180
Finally someone combined two of my favourite things

8436
07:17:39,180 --> 07:17:41,180
Well I actually got a lot of feedback

8437
07:17:41,180 --> 07:17:43,180
Where people were like

8438
07:17:43,180 --> 07:17:45,180
I am so tired of like VTubers

8439
07:17:45,180 --> 07:17:47,180
Blue bowling

8440
07:17:47,180 --> 07:17:49,180
And they'll participate in something

8441
07:17:49,180 --> 07:17:51,180
And then withdraw

8442
07:17:51,180 --> 07:17:53,180
And

8443
07:17:53,180 --> 07:17:55,180
Because they never really had a thing for it

8444
07:17:55,180 --> 07:17:57,180
And I was like oh my goodness

8445
07:17:57,180 --> 07:17:59,180
Aren't we hitting the

8446
07:17:59,180 --> 07:18:01,180
Hammer on the head with a nail

8447
07:18:01,180 --> 07:18:03,180
And the nail on the head with a hammer

8448
07:18:03,180 --> 07:18:05,180
Wait other way around

8449
07:18:05,180 --> 07:18:07,180
Finally hitting the nail on the head with a hammer

8450
07:18:09,180 --> 07:18:11,180
Because

8451
07:18:11,180 --> 07:18:13,180
It's quite literally

8452
07:18:13,180 --> 07:18:15,180
Like all of us are completely fine

8453
07:18:15,180 --> 07:18:17,180
Thankfully things are coming

8454
07:18:17,180 --> 07:18:19,180
A member

8455
07:18:27,180 --> 07:18:29,180
No refling

8456
07:18:29,180 --> 07:18:31,180
For the tip

8457
07:18:31,180 --> 07:18:33,180
No I'm not freaking leaving

8458
07:18:33,180 --> 07:18:35,180
Like I'll tell you the plan

8459
07:18:35,180 --> 07:18:37,180
I'll always tell you the plan

8460
07:18:37,180 --> 07:18:39,180
What the deal is

8461
07:18:39,180 --> 07:18:41,180
Like when have I freaking

8462
07:18:41,180 --> 07:18:43,180
I mean I'm only hitting like what

8463
07:18:43,180 --> 07:18:45,180
NDA content

8464
07:18:45,180 --> 07:18:47,180
Even then what NDA content

8465
07:18:47,180 --> 07:18:49,180
Have I got left behind at this point

8466
07:18:51,180 --> 07:18:53,180
Oh a hydration

8467
07:18:53,180 --> 07:18:55,180
I'm gonna have to drink some water

8468
07:18:55,180 --> 07:18:57,180
Need some water

8469
07:18:57,180 --> 07:18:59,180
Water from my bottle of water

8470
07:19:07,180 --> 07:19:09,180
The farm is the real plan trust

8471
07:19:09,180 --> 07:19:11,180
Trust in the farm

8472
07:19:11,180 --> 07:19:13,180
Someone says where should I eat

8473
07:19:15,180 --> 07:19:17,180
I'm getting Mexican

8474
07:19:17,180 --> 07:19:19,180
I've ordered it

8475
07:19:19,180 --> 07:19:21,180
Hold on let me check

8476
07:19:21,180 --> 07:19:23,180
Let me check where my Mexican food is

8477
07:19:23,180 --> 07:19:25,180
Hmm

8478
07:19:25,180 --> 07:19:27,180
And before it's sitting outside

8479
07:19:27,180 --> 07:19:29,180
Oh wait hold on

8480
07:19:37,180 --> 07:19:39,180
Wait scriptmasters asking

8481
07:19:39,180 --> 07:19:41,180
What are you even

8482
07:19:41,180 --> 07:19:43,180
So the sentence mom says I'm in charge

8483
07:19:43,180 --> 07:19:45,180
Is way over the lane

8484
07:19:45,180 --> 07:19:47,180
Yuck

8485
07:19:47,180 --> 07:19:49,180
Yes

8486
07:19:49,180 --> 07:19:51,180
Because that implies

8487
07:19:51,180 --> 07:19:53,180
Sorry you guys are getting correction

8488
07:19:53,180 --> 07:19:55,180
Yes come on please

8489
07:19:57,180 --> 07:19:59,180
Okay there we go sorry scriptmasters

8490
07:19:59,180 --> 07:20:01,180
Trying to really help out the pinpals here

8491
07:20:05,180 --> 07:20:07,180
I'm trying to tell them like

8492
07:20:07,180 --> 07:20:09,180
You need to skirt the patreon to yours

8493
07:20:09,180 --> 07:20:11,180
I don't know

8494
07:20:11,180 --> 07:20:13,180
Boring inside yourself

8495
07:20:13,180 --> 07:20:15,180
Okay

8496
07:20:15,180 --> 07:20:17,180
We will have a castle

8497
07:20:17,180 --> 07:20:19,180
And I'm gonna let it out a little cafe

8498
07:20:21,180 --> 07:20:23,180
Okay

8499
07:20:23,180 --> 07:20:25,180
That sounds like a scary

8500
07:20:25,180 --> 07:20:27,180
Oh a spicy script

8501
07:20:27,180 --> 07:20:29,180
Very much so

8502
07:20:29,180 --> 07:20:31,180
Azura's four part series

8503
07:20:31,180 --> 07:20:33,180
Got finished main

8504
07:20:33,180 --> 07:20:35,180
My four part series is now gonna be

8505
07:20:35,180 --> 07:20:37,180
On Twitter for free because

8506
07:20:37,180 --> 07:20:39,180
It's not allowed

8507
07:20:39,180 --> 07:20:41,180
So I'll need to think of another four part series

8508
07:20:41,180 --> 07:20:43,180
Maybe

8509
07:20:43,180 --> 07:20:45,180
He's feeling a cheeky Chinese

8510
07:20:45,180 --> 07:20:47,180
Takeout honestly

8511
07:20:47,180 --> 07:20:49,180
Chinese and Australia is amazing

8512
07:20:49,180 --> 07:20:51,180
It's so good

8513
07:20:51,180 --> 07:20:53,180

8514
07:20:53,180 --> 07:20:55,180
Bye bye I have to sleep

Have an ice stream

8516
07:20:57,180 --> 07:20:59,180
Thank you so much

8517
07:20:59,180 --> 07:21:01,180
For anyone who needs to sleep

8518
07:21:01,180 --> 07:21:03,180
Or I need to get a few things done around

8519
07:21:03,180 --> 07:21:05,180
The house

8520
07:21:05,180 --> 07:21:07,180
Or you need to get some water in you

8521
07:21:07,180 --> 07:21:09,180
Please don't be afraid to go do so

8522
07:21:09,180 --> 07:21:11,180
Keep yourself as healthy as possible

8523
07:21:11,180 --> 07:21:13,180
A succulent Chinese meal

8524
07:21:15,180 --> 07:21:17,180
Oh I should do a Scottish dub of that

8525
07:21:17,180 --> 07:21:19,180
What have I done wrong

8526
07:21:19,180 --> 07:21:21,180
Just enjoying a meal

8527
07:21:21,180 --> 07:21:23,180
A succulent Chinese meal

8528
07:21:25,180 --> 07:21:27,180
Dubbing

8529
07:21:27,180 --> 07:21:29,180
Dubbing memes

8530
07:21:29,180 --> 07:21:31,180
But I'm Scottish

8531
07:21:31,180 --> 07:21:33,180
Video

8532
07:21:33,180 --> 07:21:35,180
Honestly

8533
07:21:35,180 --> 07:21:37,180
Maybe that would work out

8534
07:21:37,180 --> 07:21:39,180
I feel like that's got potential

8535
07:21:39,180 --> 07:21:41,180
A wee bit of potential not too much

8536
07:21:41,180 --> 07:21:43,180
Get your hands off

8537
07:21:43,180 --> 07:21:45,180
My tajer

8538
07:21:45,180 --> 07:21:47,180
This

8539
07:21:47,180 --> 07:21:49,180
Is

8540
07:21:49,180 --> 07:21:51,180
Democracy

8541
07:21:51,180 --> 07:21:53,180
Manifest

8542
07:21:53,180 --> 07:21:55,180
Get your hands off my

8543
07:21:55,180 --> 07:21:57,180
Cuttlefish star

8544
07:21:57,180 --> 07:21:59,180
Honestly maybe we might be onto something

8545
07:21:59,180 --> 07:22:01,180
A little funny ha ha series

8546
07:22:03,180 --> 07:22:05,180
I can go there

8547
07:22:05,180 --> 07:22:07,180
Unhand my hose

8548
07:22:07,180 --> 07:22:09,180
Hell nah

8549
07:22:09,180 --> 07:22:11,180
I've got to stay and see the end of the day

8550
07:22:11,180 --> 07:22:13,180
That'll be AAM

8551
07:22:13,180 --> 07:22:15,180
That's so unhealthy though

8552
07:22:15,180 --> 07:22:17,180
You should sleep

8553
07:22:17,180 --> 07:22:19,180
Only I can do such endurance things

8554
07:22:19,180 --> 07:22:21,180
Cause I'm a big girl

8555
07:22:21,180 --> 07:22:23,180
If there's anyone lurking

8556
07:22:23,180 --> 07:22:25,180
Who is perishing

8557
07:22:25,180 --> 07:22:27,180
Azuriduli is on

8558
07:22:27,180 --> 07:22:29,180
Stray

8559
07:22:29,180 --> 07:22:31,180
Azuriduli is playing Stray

8560
07:22:31,180 --> 07:22:33,180
And Mercy Modest

8561
07:22:33,180 --> 07:22:35,180
Is playing Harvester part 2

8562
07:22:37,180 --> 07:22:39,180
Azuriduli is live

8563
07:22:39,180 --> 07:22:41,180
Mercy is live in T-minus

8564
07:22:41,180 --> 07:22:43,180
1 hour 30

8565
07:22:43,180 --> 07:22:45,180
I repeat in T-minus 1 hour 30

8566
07:22:45,180 --> 07:22:47,180
Modi

8567
07:22:47,180 --> 07:22:49,180
Modi

8568
07:22:49,180 --> 07:22:51,180
Mercy Modest is live

8569
07:22:51,180 --> 07:22:53,180
Wow someone levelled up

8570
07:22:53,180 --> 07:22:55,180
Congrats

8571
07:22:55,180 --> 07:22:57,180
Ah

8572
07:22:57,180 --> 07:22:59,180
I see you know judo well

8573
07:22:59,180 --> 07:23:01,180
And you are ready to receive my

8574
07:23:01,180 --> 07:23:03,180
Limp

8575
07:23:03,180 --> 07:23:05,180
Just like the blue

8576
07:23:05,180 --> 07:23:07,180
Scottish Power Ranger

8577
07:23:07,180 --> 07:23:09,180
Honestly

8578
07:23:09,180 --> 07:23:11,180
Pick the memes right

8579
07:23:11,180 --> 07:23:13,180
And it's probably got a lot of potential

8580
07:23:13,180 --> 07:23:15,180
I thought about doing like

8581
07:23:15,180 --> 07:23:17,180
Reading the most bizarre

8582
07:23:17,180 --> 07:23:19,180
Reddit stories

8583
07:23:19,180 --> 07:23:21,180
Cause there's a really famous one

8584
07:23:21,180 --> 07:23:23,180
Where this guy broke both his arms

8585
07:23:23,180 --> 07:23:25,180
But I can't say the rest of it

8586
07:23:25,180 --> 07:23:27,180
But I wanted to read it

8587
07:23:27,180 --> 07:23:29,180
Cause I thought it was alright

8588
07:23:29,180 --> 07:23:31,180
But I'm not sure it would work out

8589
07:23:31,180 --> 07:23:33,180
Maybe it would be like a twitter series

8590
07:23:33,180 --> 07:23:35,180
I guess

8591
07:23:35,180 --> 07:23:37,180
I'll be like oh go subscribe to my youtube

8592
07:23:37,180 --> 07:23:39,180
My youtube

8593
07:23:43,180 --> 07:23:45,180
Time for work unfortunately

8594
07:23:45,180 --> 07:23:47,180
Have a good stream

8595
07:23:47,180 --> 07:23:49,180
No you have a good work day

8596
07:23:49,180 --> 07:23:51,180
How dare you

8597
07:23:51,180 --> 07:23:53,180
Please remember to hydrate and look after yourself

8598
07:23:53,180 --> 07:23:55,180
And remember

8599
07:23:55,180 --> 07:23:57,180
Boss makes a dollar

8600
07:23:57,180 --> 07:23:59,180
You make a dime

8601
07:23:59,180 --> 07:24:01,180
That's why you take a big job beyond company

8602
07:24:01,180 --> 07:24:03,180
time

8603
07:24:03,180 --> 07:24:05,180
Please make sure that any stress levels

8604
07:24:05,180 --> 07:24:07,180
Are

8605
07:24:07,180 --> 07:24:09,180
At your pay grade

8606
07:24:09,180 --> 07:24:11,180
If you get paid minimum wage

8607
07:24:11,180 --> 07:24:13,180
That's not your problem

8608
07:24:13,180 --> 07:24:15,180
Should have paid you more

8609
07:24:15,180 --> 07:24:17,180
To care more

8610
07:24:17,180 --> 07:24:19,180
Damn

8611
07:24:19,180 --> 07:24:21,180
Get back

8612
07:24:21,180 --> 07:24:23,180
Oh is that

8613
07:24:23,180 --> 07:24:25,180
The arm where he gets some help

8614
07:24:25,180 --> 07:24:27,180
Read the number 15

8615
07:24:35,180 --> 07:24:37,180
I bought blue bed

8616
07:24:37,180 --> 07:24:39,180
Burger king foot lettuce

8617
07:24:43,180 --> 07:24:45,180
I've already forgotten the freaking

8618
07:24:45,180 --> 07:24:47,180
What the frick I just said the B version of the meme

8619
07:24:47,180 --> 07:24:49,180
Burger king foot lettuce

8620
07:24:49,180 --> 07:24:51,180
That's the thing you want in your burger king

8621
07:24:53,180 --> 07:24:55,180
Burger king

8622
07:24:55,180 --> 07:24:57,180
Boot lettuce

8623
07:24:57,180 --> 07:24:59,180
Oh my god what

8624
07:24:59,180 --> 07:25:01,180
Do a 5 part audio where you're getting paid

8625
07:25:01,180 --> 07:25:03,180
Prego we each door

8626
07:25:03,180 --> 07:25:05,180
How would I do that though

8627
07:25:05,180 --> 07:25:07,180
Oh yeah give me a broken

8628
07:25:09,180 --> 07:25:11,180
Oh no

8629
07:25:11,180 --> 07:25:13,180
That's not gonna work

8630
07:25:13,180 --> 07:25:15,180
Maker ginger

8631
07:25:15,180 --> 07:25:17,180
Maker blue hair but no

8632
07:25:17,180 --> 07:25:19,180
What

8633
07:25:19,180 --> 07:25:21,180
We can't make that

8634
07:25:21,180 --> 07:25:23,180
I've got a sea queen

8635
07:25:23,180 --> 07:25:25,180
Audio coming out

8636
07:25:25,180 --> 07:25:27,180
Where I share you

8637
07:25:27,180 --> 07:25:29,180
With all my daughters

8638
07:25:29,180 --> 07:25:31,180
And

8639
07:25:31,180 --> 07:25:33,180
I always take a hmm first thing

8640
07:25:33,180 --> 07:25:35,180
On my shift if you're good at something

8641
07:25:35,180 --> 07:25:37,180
Never do it for free exactly

8642
07:25:37,180 --> 07:25:39,180
The Joker was a kitten

8643
07:25:39,180 --> 07:25:41,180
That's what food coloring is for

8644
07:25:41,180 --> 07:25:43,180
Didn't you get

8645
07:25:43,180 --> 07:25:45,180
With all the girls at the same time

8646
07:25:45,180 --> 07:25:47,180
In the ASMR booth with the eyes covered

8647
07:25:47,180 --> 07:25:49,180
Yeah basically that's how it happens though

8648
07:25:53,180 --> 07:25:55,180
But yeah I've got a sea queen audio

8649
07:25:55,180 --> 07:25:57,180
I think it'll be a donut on reward

8650
07:25:57,180 --> 07:25:59,180
Like cause the girls

8651
07:25:59,180 --> 07:26:01,180
Are all gonna like help each other out

8652
07:26:01,180 --> 07:26:03,180
With their donut on rewards like

8653
07:26:03,180 --> 07:26:05,180
As a

8654
07:26:05,180 --> 07:26:07,180
As a like yeah let's go

8655
07:26:09,180 --> 07:26:11,180
Sea queen that's the only way we can

8656
07:26:11,180 --> 07:26:13,180
That's the new saying

8657
07:26:15,180 --> 07:26:17,180
POV all the girls are fighting over you

8658
07:26:19,180 --> 07:26:21,180
The one human left on earth that hasn't

8659
07:26:21,180 --> 07:26:23,180
Decided on which girl

8660
07:26:23,180 --> 07:26:25,180
I thought about

8661
07:26:25,180 --> 07:26:27,180
I see an Emmy doing something like that

8662
07:26:27,180 --> 07:26:29,180
Where they're fighting over

8663
07:26:31,180 --> 07:26:33,180
Where the ink goes

8664
07:26:33,180 --> 07:26:35,180
Or who the ink goes to

8665
07:26:39,180 --> 07:26:41,180
Sea queen

8666
07:26:41,180 --> 07:26:43,180
Yeah I mean that's pretty creative

8667
07:26:43,180 --> 07:26:45,180
I'll give you that that's pretty creative

8668
07:26:45,180 --> 07:26:47,180
Yeah I see an Emmy with a hundred percent

8669
07:26:47,180 --> 07:26:49,180
Fight over it but I find it really

8670
07:26:49,180 --> 07:26:51,180
Hard

8671
07:26:51,180 --> 07:26:53,180
To do that kind of

8672
07:26:53,180 --> 07:26:55,180
Seven

8673
07:26:55,180 --> 07:26:57,180
Five hundred swordfish and I burned two

8674
07:26:57,180 --> 07:26:59,180
K of them I burnt so much swordfish as well

8675
07:26:59,180 --> 07:27:01,180
Don't worry

8676
07:27:01,180 --> 07:27:03,180
Where the ink goes yeah

8677
07:27:03,180 --> 07:27:05,180
If Emmy and I see ever collab like that

8678
07:27:05,180 --> 07:27:07,180
I would be so happy

8679
07:27:07,180 --> 07:27:09,180
I mean they already got a collab audio on the way

8680
07:27:09,180 --> 07:27:11,180
Of that nature

8681
07:27:11,180 --> 07:27:13,180
But it's a bit

8682
07:27:13,180 --> 07:27:15,180
Different

8683
07:27:15,180 --> 07:27:17,180
Do you want spoilers or do you not want

8684
07:27:17,180 --> 07:27:19,180
Spoilers I don't mind doing spoilers

8685
07:27:19,180 --> 07:27:21,180
I think it's coming up

8686
07:27:21,180 --> 07:27:23,180
Is it August the collab audio start

8687
07:27:23,180 --> 07:27:25,180
Of I think it might be

8688
07:27:27,180 --> 07:27:29,180
It's got to be really hard to do

8689
07:27:29,180 --> 07:27:31,180
I want spoilers

8690
07:27:31,180 --> 07:27:33,180
No spoilers

8691
07:27:33,180 --> 07:27:35,180
Oh no you guys are split

8692
07:27:37,180 --> 07:27:39,180
Go hard with spoilers

8693
07:27:41,180 --> 07:27:43,180
So in the plot

8694
07:27:43,180 --> 07:27:45,180
Close your ears if you don't want

8695
07:27:45,180 --> 07:27:47,180
Any spoilers in the plot

8696
07:27:47,180 --> 07:27:49,180
AC and Emmy fell out

8697
07:27:49,180 --> 07:27:51,180
And you

8698
07:27:51,180 --> 07:27:53,180
The listener

8699
07:27:53,180 --> 07:27:55,180
You can either be a pin pal

8700
07:27:55,180 --> 07:27:57,180
Or a snowberry

8701
07:27:57,180 --> 07:27:59,180
You force them to

8702
07:28:01,180 --> 07:28:03,180
To make up

8703
07:28:03,180 --> 07:28:05,180
By

8704
07:28:05,180 --> 07:28:07,180
Using a massage gun

8705
07:28:07,180 --> 07:28:09,180
To relieve their muscle tension

8706
07:28:09,180 --> 07:28:11,180
Because their muscle

8707
07:28:11,180 --> 07:28:13,180
Tensions the reason why they fell out

8708
07:28:13,180 --> 07:28:15,180
Hmm

8709
07:28:15,180 --> 07:28:17,180
Hmm

8710
07:28:17,180 --> 07:28:19,180
Okay

8711
07:28:19,180 --> 07:28:21,180
Then me and Mercy have one

8712
07:28:21,180 --> 07:28:23,180
Where we're

8713
07:28:23,180 --> 07:28:25,180
Nurses that shouldn't be qualified

8714
07:28:25,180 --> 07:28:27,180
Because of what we do

8715
07:28:27,180 --> 07:28:29,180
And then

8716
07:28:29,180 --> 07:28:31,180
Azura and Sheeby's one

8717
07:28:31,180 --> 07:28:33,180
I don't think the masses

8718
07:28:33,180 --> 07:28:35,180
Are gonna like it

8719
07:28:35,180 --> 07:28:37,180
I'm not gonna change it

8720
07:28:37,180 --> 07:28:39,180
Because I like the script

8721
07:28:39,180 --> 07:28:41,180
I like it but I'm not sure the masses

8722
07:28:41,180 --> 07:28:43,180
Are gonna like it

8723
07:28:43,180 --> 07:28:45,180
Can Sheeby

8724
07:28:45,180 --> 07:28:47,180
Catch you in public

8725
07:28:47,180 --> 07:28:49,180
Um

8726
07:28:49,180 --> 07:28:51,180
Cross-grossing

8727
07:28:51,180 --> 07:28:53,180
And they m-word you

8728
07:28:53,180 --> 07:28:55,180
And I don't know if it's gonna

8729
07:28:55,180 --> 07:28:57,180
Go down well or not

8730
07:28:57,180 --> 07:28:59,180
It's a very unique scenario

8731
07:28:59,180 --> 07:29:01,180
But please

8732
07:29:01,180 --> 07:29:03,180
And before you're like oh my god I hate it

8733
07:29:03,180 --> 07:29:05,180
Oh my god Strony I hope you die in a fire

8734
07:29:05,180 --> 07:29:07,180
Because you wrote that

8735
07:29:07,180 --> 07:29:09,180
Do you honestly think they're never gonna do another collab audio again

8736
07:29:09,180 --> 07:29:11,180
Don't be so silly

8737
07:29:11,180 --> 07:29:13,180
The first one that I gave

8738
07:29:13,180 --> 07:29:15,180
Yeah it was pretty sp- it was pretty

8739
07:29:15,180 --> 07:29:17,180
Out there I don't know it's just the

8740
07:29:17,180 --> 07:29:19,180
Inspiration I got to write for them

8741
07:29:19,180 --> 07:29:21,180
Till I wrote it and there it was

8742
07:29:21,180 --> 07:29:23,180
And they what

8743
07:29:23,180 --> 07:29:25,180
Holy moly this is spicy meatball

8744
07:29:25,180 --> 07:29:27,180
A massage gun yes

8745
07:29:27,180 --> 07:29:29,180
A massage gun I'm excited for that

8746
07:29:29,180 --> 07:29:31,180
It's spicy

8747
07:29:31,180 --> 07:29:33,180
Oh boy that one does sound very uh

8748
07:29:33,180 --> 07:29:35,180
Yes uh

8749
07:29:35,180 --> 07:29:37,180
That sounds like something

8750
07:29:37,180 --> 07:29:39,180
Patreon would get no they don't

8751
07:29:39,180 --> 07:29:41,180
They don't care um

8752
07:29:41,180 --> 07:29:43,180
I know what's uh good

8753
07:29:43,180 --> 07:29:45,180
To go and what's not good to go on Patreon

8754
07:29:45,180 --> 07:29:47,180
So damn y'all really pretty

8755
07:29:47,180 --> 07:29:49,180
Yeah

8756
07:29:49,180 --> 07:29:51,180
There's a few things I wanted to cover um

8757
07:29:55,180 --> 07:29:57,180
Having the freedom to explore a

8758
07:29:57,180 --> 07:29:59,180
Bunch of scripts

8759
07:29:59,180 --> 07:30:01,180
Is something the scripts have

8760
07:30:03,180 --> 07:30:05,180
Yeah like um

8761
07:30:05,180 --> 07:30:07,180
It's just different things were hitting along

8762
07:30:07,180 --> 07:30:09,180
The way like as I said

8763
07:30:09,180 --> 07:30:11,180
I kind of said it from the start

8764
07:30:11,180 --> 07:30:13,180
I'm not pigeon

8765
07:30:13,180 --> 07:30:15,180
Holding any girl

8766
07:30:15,180 --> 07:30:17,180
Into a particular

8767
07:30:17,180 --> 07:30:19,180
Category because doing so

8768
07:30:19,180 --> 07:30:21,180
Will limit their

8769
07:30:21,180 --> 07:30:23,180
Income source and their income source

8770
07:30:23,180 --> 07:30:25,180
And longevity are related

8771
07:30:25,180 --> 07:30:27,180
To their success of the allure

8772
07:30:27,180 --> 07:30:29,180
And I do not want

8773
07:30:29,180 --> 07:30:31,180
To kneecap anyone

8774
07:30:31,180 --> 07:30:33,180
That's not fair

8775
07:30:33,180 --> 07:30:35,180
It is what it is

8776
07:30:35,180 --> 07:30:37,180
In spaces scenarios compared to anything else

8777
07:30:37,180 --> 07:30:39,180
I've seen this is some top two content

8778
07:30:39,180 --> 07:30:41,180
Yes and

8779
07:30:41,180 --> 07:30:43,180
Literally when the girls do collab audios again

8780
07:30:43,180 --> 07:30:45,180
They still have three other audios

8781
07:30:45,180 --> 07:30:47,180
Going out that month as well so it's not like

8782
07:30:47,180 --> 07:30:49,180
You know not everything can be for you

8783
07:30:49,180 --> 07:30:51,180
We live in a society

8784
07:30:51,180 --> 07:30:53,180
Of burnt fish

8785
07:30:55,180 --> 07:30:57,180
I like to try different stuff yeah

8786
07:30:57,180 --> 07:30:59,180
Literally just give it a shot either

8787
07:30:59,180 --> 07:31:01,180
You'll listen to it and you'll be like this isn't for me

8788
07:31:01,180 --> 07:31:03,180
Or you'll be like okay

8789
07:31:03,180 --> 07:31:05,180
I'm reacting

8790
07:31:05,180 --> 07:31:07,180
Smile

8791
07:31:07,180 --> 07:31:09,180
There's only two outcomes

8792
07:31:09,180 --> 07:31:11,180
It's either no thank you and turn it off

8793
07:31:11,180 --> 07:31:13,180
Or I'm reacting smile

8794
07:31:15,180 --> 07:31:17,180
We'll get

8795
07:31:17,180 --> 07:31:19,180
We'll all get something at some time

8796
07:31:19,180 --> 07:31:21,180
Yeah basically literally everyone

8797
07:31:21,180 --> 07:31:23,180
Is here for

8798
07:31:23,180 --> 07:31:25,180
It's not possible

8799
07:31:25,180 --> 07:31:27,180
For a creator to come out with something you love 100%

8800
07:31:27,180 --> 07:31:29,180
At the time it's just not possible

8801
07:31:29,180 --> 07:31:31,180
Unless they do the same thing over and over

8802
07:31:31,180 --> 07:31:33,180
Again but then that is like

8803
07:31:33,180 --> 07:31:35,180
Really pigeonholing and it's

8804
07:31:35,180 --> 07:31:37,180
For the success of my girlies

8805
07:31:37,180 --> 07:31:39,180
Okay

8806
07:31:39,180 --> 07:31:41,180
They gotta succeed

8807
07:31:41,180 --> 07:31:43,180
Or what's gonna make them wanna sign their

8808
07:31:43,180 --> 07:31:45,180
The second year of the contract huh

8809
07:31:47,180 --> 07:31:49,180
Can't wait to find out

8810
07:31:49,180 --> 07:31:51,180
What it is I love

8811
07:31:51,180 --> 07:31:53,180
AC and Katelyn so much

8812
07:31:53,180 --> 07:31:55,180
Aw I'm glad

8813
07:31:55,180 --> 07:31:57,180
Thanks

8814
07:31:57,180 --> 07:31:59,180
Thanks for reading it

8815
07:31:59,180 --> 07:32:01,180
Anyway

8816
07:32:01,180 --> 07:32:03,180
They just misspelled

8817
07:32:03,180 --> 07:32:05,180
Something that said it wrong or something

8818
07:32:05,180 --> 07:32:07,180
It's okay

8819
07:32:07,180 --> 07:32:09,180
I'm not into feet but I like curious

8820
07:32:09,180 --> 07:32:11,180
Oh yeah

8821
07:32:11,180 --> 07:32:13,180
I love everything

8822
07:32:13,180 --> 07:32:15,180
Viewers done so far thank you

8823
07:32:17,180 --> 07:32:19,180
You know I had a year

8824
07:32:19,180 --> 07:32:21,180
In the making and

8825
07:32:21,180 --> 07:32:23,180
Just everything has fallen into place

8826
07:32:23,180 --> 07:32:25,180
So beautifully

8827
07:32:25,180 --> 07:32:27,180
I spoke to

8828
07:32:27,180 --> 07:32:29,180
I'm gonna butcher her name

8829
07:32:29,180 --> 07:32:31,180
So badly

8830
07:32:31,180 --> 07:32:33,180
The beach of her obaque

8831
07:32:33,180 --> 07:32:35,180
That's definitely not how you say it

8832
07:32:35,180 --> 07:32:37,180
But

8833
07:32:37,180 --> 07:32:39,180
She was talking about a project

8834
07:32:39,180 --> 07:32:41,180
Finally coming together and

8835
07:32:41,180 --> 07:32:43,180
You know I was like oh I can completely

8836
07:32:43,180 --> 07:32:45,180
Relate to that so I replied to it

8837
07:32:45,180 --> 07:32:47,180
And I was like

8838
07:32:47,180 --> 07:32:49,180
When the puzzle pieces finally arrive

8839
07:32:49,180 --> 07:32:51,180
And you can start slotting them into place

8840
07:32:51,180 --> 07:32:53,180
It's so satisfying

8841
07:32:53,180 --> 07:32:55,180
And

8842
07:32:55,180 --> 07:32:57,180
And I felt that to my very core

8843
07:32:59,180 --> 07:33:01,180
Obaque

8844
07:33:01,180 --> 07:33:03,180
Yeah it's not obaque

8845
07:33:03,180 --> 07:33:05,180
There's no way that's how you're supposed to say it

8846
07:33:05,180 --> 07:33:07,180
Sounds like I'm trying to say tobacco

8847
07:33:07,180 --> 07:33:09,180
Obaque

8848
07:33:09,180 --> 07:33:11,180
That's exactly how you say obaque

8849
07:33:11,180 --> 07:33:13,180
Oh wow

8850
07:33:13,180 --> 07:33:15,180
Not me

8851
07:33:15,180 --> 07:33:17,180
Accidentally being smart

8852
07:33:17,180 --> 07:33:19,180
I can't believe it

8853
07:33:19,180 --> 07:33:21,180
Obaque

8854
07:33:23,180 --> 07:33:25,180
It is the first try

8855
07:33:25,180 --> 07:33:27,180
I'm so smart with the heck

8856
07:33:27,180 --> 07:33:29,180
Yeah she put up a tweet

8857
07:33:29,180 --> 07:33:31,180
Saying her projects are finally coming together

8858
07:33:31,180 --> 07:33:33,180
And I'm like oh I can relate to that

8859
07:33:33,180 --> 07:33:35,180
On such a deeper level

8860
07:33:37,180 --> 07:33:39,180
And

8861
07:33:39,180 --> 07:33:41,180
When we succeeded to be

8862
07:33:41,180 --> 07:33:43,180
Five moods ahead in her main chess game

8863
07:33:43,180 --> 07:33:45,180
I can't wait to

8864
07:33:45,180 --> 07:33:47,180
One be one years in chess actually

8865
07:33:47,180 --> 07:33:49,180
I'm not ready

8866
07:33:49,180 --> 07:33:51,180
Tobacco stream

8867
07:33:51,180 --> 07:33:53,180
No, no tobacco

8868
07:33:53,180 --> 07:33:55,180
I can't smoke

8869
07:33:55,180 --> 07:33:57,180
I can hardly drink

8870
07:33:57,180 --> 07:33:59,180
To the life of me

8871
07:33:59,180 --> 07:34:01,180
I get one beer in me and I'm gone

8872
07:34:01,180 --> 07:34:03,180
That's why I wanted to do drunk apex

8873
07:34:03,180 --> 07:34:05,180
Because we can all do Salt Lake city server again

8874
07:34:05,180 --> 07:34:07,180
Because no one's in it other than us

8875
07:34:09,180 --> 07:34:11,180
I don't know what drunk game

8876
07:34:11,180 --> 07:34:13,180
I wanted to do drunk game

8877
07:34:13,180 --> 07:34:15,180
But I don't go offline until we win

8878
07:34:15,180 --> 07:34:17,180
Type of thing

8879
07:34:17,180 --> 07:34:19,180
But I didn't know what game to do

8880
07:34:21,180 --> 07:34:23,180
If I lose

8881
07:34:23,180 --> 07:34:25,180
I get to see discord route

8882
07:34:25,180 --> 07:34:27,180
What?

8883
07:34:29,180 --> 07:34:31,180
Wait

8884
07:34:31,180 --> 07:34:33,180
What if you lose the one be one chess

8885
07:34:33,180 --> 07:34:35,180
You get to see the discord where we all say inappropriate stuff

8886
07:34:35,180 --> 07:34:37,180
To each other

8887
07:34:37,180 --> 07:34:39,180
Say no in that one chief

8888
07:34:41,180 --> 07:34:43,180
I've been a lazy reflin

8889
07:34:43,180 --> 07:34:45,180
You haven't

8890
07:34:45,180 --> 07:34:47,180
Have you not checked any of them out

8891
07:34:49,180 --> 07:34:51,180
Actually the highlight

8892
07:34:51,180 --> 07:34:53,180
Reels are from debut

8893
07:34:53,180 --> 07:34:55,180
Or right around the corner

8894
07:34:55,180 --> 07:34:57,180
I think there's one more girl that needs to be made

8895
07:35:01,180 --> 07:35:03,180
And then the debut highlight

8896
07:35:03,180 --> 07:35:05,180
Things can be made

8897
07:35:07,180 --> 07:35:09,180
Can be uploaded

8898
07:35:09,180 --> 07:35:11,180
Check them out

8899
07:35:11,180 --> 07:35:13,180
What opening do you use in chess

8900
07:35:13,180 --> 07:35:15,180
I call it the twat move

8901
07:35:15,180 --> 07:35:17,180
Because I don't know what on earth

8902
07:35:17,180 --> 07:35:19,180
Is my opening move

8903
07:35:19,180 --> 07:35:21,180
Probably the

8904
07:35:21,180 --> 07:35:23,180
Second pawn

8905
07:35:23,180 --> 07:35:25,180
Just shove them out by two

8906
07:35:25,180 --> 07:35:27,180
Have a week go

8907
07:35:27,180 --> 07:35:29,180
I don't know nothing about chess

8908
07:35:29,180 --> 07:35:31,180
All I know is that I want a one be one you guys

8909
07:35:31,180 --> 07:35:33,180
In chess and I'll put classical music

8910
07:35:33,180 --> 07:35:35,180
On in the background

8911
07:35:35,180 --> 07:35:37,180
And I'll see if I can even win against

8912
07:35:37,180 --> 07:35:39,180
One refling

8913
07:35:39,180 --> 07:35:41,180
It'll be interesting to see if I can win one game

8914
07:35:43,180 --> 07:35:45,180
I can easily recommend girls

8915
07:35:45,180 --> 07:35:47,180
Like a shopkeeper

8916
07:35:49,180 --> 07:35:51,180
I have a secret conspiracy

8917
07:35:51,180 --> 07:35:53,180
Strony allows a small handful of fans

8918
07:35:53,180 --> 07:35:55,180
Into the discord every month or so

8919
07:35:55,180 --> 07:35:57,180
To be grim by the girls

8920
07:35:57,180 --> 07:35:59,180
Then makes them forget and kicks them out

8921
07:35:59,180 --> 07:36:01,180
It's actually quite funny

8922
07:36:01,180 --> 07:36:03,180
No I assure you

8923
07:36:03,180 --> 07:36:05,180
Absolutely nothing goes on in the discord

8924
07:36:07,180 --> 07:36:09,180
Mercedes ASMR was a banger

8925
07:36:09,180 --> 07:36:11,180
Is there meme ASMR

8926
07:36:11,180 --> 07:36:13,180
No I didn't upload it

8927
07:36:13,180 --> 07:36:15,180
Her actual ASMR stream got

8928
07:36:15,180 --> 07:36:17,180
25,000 views

8929
07:36:17,180 --> 07:36:19,180
Which is insane

8930
07:36:19,180 --> 07:36:21,180
Insane in the membrane

8931
07:36:21,180 --> 07:36:23,180
Can you drill my dad

8932
07:36:23,180 --> 07:36:25,180
I'm terrible at chess

8933
07:36:25,180 --> 07:36:27,180
But he plays it daily

8934
07:36:27,180 --> 07:36:29,180
Are you joking me he'd like smoke me in one

8935
07:36:29,180 --> 07:36:31,180
You can play checkers

8936
07:36:31,180 --> 07:36:33,180
And connect four richest people here

8937
07:36:33,180 --> 07:36:35,180
What in runescape

8938
07:36:37,180 --> 07:36:39,180
Play checker

8939
07:36:39,180 --> 07:36:41,180
What play connect four with me in runescape

8940
07:36:41,180 --> 07:36:43,180
Right now what

8941
07:36:43,180 --> 07:36:45,180
How'd I do that

8942
07:36:45,180 --> 07:36:47,180
Is that real

8943
07:36:47,180 --> 07:36:49,180
At the grand exchange

8944
07:36:49,180 --> 07:36:51,180
Hold on wait let me finish

8945
07:36:51,180 --> 07:36:53,180
Doing this batch of fish

8946
07:36:53,180 --> 07:36:55,180
We're going to the grand exchange like right now

8947
07:36:55,180 --> 07:36:57,180
Hello

8948
07:36:59,180 --> 07:37:01,180
Where's the grand exchange

8949
07:37:01,180 --> 07:37:03,180
A little to the right

8950
07:37:03,180 --> 07:37:05,180
Oh there's a bridge here

8951
07:37:05,180 --> 07:37:07,180
We don't have the fricking tunnel at the grand exchange

8952
07:37:07,180 --> 07:37:09,180
We're going to have to go down in our wall

8953
07:37:09,180 --> 07:37:11,180
What we can

8954
07:37:11,180 --> 07:37:13,180
Fricking 1v1 each other

8955
07:37:13,180 --> 07:37:15,180
Right we're going to the grand exchange

8956
07:37:15,180 --> 07:37:17,180
To play connect four I'm not even kidding

8957
07:37:17,180 --> 07:37:19,180
I'll empty my inventory though

8958
07:37:19,180 --> 07:37:21,180
I don't want to go filthy

8959
07:37:21,180 --> 07:37:23,180
Stranny I'd feel bad about beating you in chess

8960
07:37:23,180 --> 07:37:25,180
Oh no that's the thing I like losing

8961
07:37:25,180 --> 07:37:27,180
You know

8962
07:37:27,180 --> 07:37:29,180
Dom loss and all

8963
07:37:31,180 --> 07:37:33,180
You see you know if I lose against you after you said

8964
07:37:33,180 --> 07:37:35,180
You have never played would be such a sad and depressing thing

8965
07:37:35,180 --> 07:37:37,180
I would need something to feel happier

8966
07:37:37,180 --> 07:37:39,180
Get plopped get plopped get plopped

8967
07:37:39,180 --> 07:37:41,180
There you have it

8968
07:37:41,180 --> 07:37:43,180
I'm joined listening to you

8969
07:37:43,180 --> 07:37:45,180
I'm playing Overwatch in the meantime

8970
07:37:45,180 --> 07:37:47,180
Oh god how is Overwatch these days

8971
07:37:47,180 --> 07:37:49,180
I know a new character came out

8972
07:37:49,180 --> 07:37:51,180
Venture but

8973
07:37:51,180 --> 07:37:53,180
Um

8974
07:37:53,180 --> 07:37:55,180
Folk weren't happy about or something

8975
07:37:55,180 --> 07:37:57,180
I've nothing

8976
07:37:57,180 --> 07:37:59,180
Apparently she eats rocks

8977
07:37:59,180 --> 07:38:01,180
Lamal

8978
07:38:01,180 --> 07:38:03,180
Here

8979
07:38:03,180 --> 07:38:05,180
Right

8980
07:38:05,180 --> 07:38:07,180
Right we're going if any

8981
07:38:07,180 --> 07:38:09,180
Reflings want to follow me just follow my character

8982
07:38:09,180 --> 07:38:11,180
And then

8983
07:38:11,180 --> 07:38:13,180
We'll go down to the grand exchange

8984
07:38:13,180 --> 07:38:15,180
To play connect four

8985
07:38:15,180 --> 07:38:17,180
Any Reflings want to come

8986
07:38:21,180 --> 07:38:23,180
Right okay

8987
07:38:23,180 --> 07:38:25,180
We're going to the grand exchange

8988
07:38:25,180 --> 07:38:27,180

9127
07:44:01,180 --> 07:44:03,180
One two three

9128
07:44:03,180 --> 07:44:05,180

9129
07:44:05,180 --> 07:44:07,180
I don't know how to do this

9130
07:44:09,180 --> 07:44:11,180

Replayings this is so hard

9135
07:44:23,180 --> 07:44:25,180
I don't think I can win

9136
07:44:25,180 --> 07:44:27,180
I can't put any here or I lose

9137
07:44:27,180 --> 07:44:29,180
Or here

9138
07:44:29,180 --> 07:44:31,180
So I'm basically just stacking

07:44:31,180 --> 07:44:33,180
Them to the ceiling

9140
07:44:33,180 --> 07:44:35,180

9152
07:44:57,180 --> 07:44:59,180

07:44:59,180 --> 07:45:01,180
Right

9154
07:45:01,180 --> 07:45:03,180
I'm gonna go in the middle

9155
07:45:05,180 --> 07:45:07,180
Surely

9156
07:45:07,180 --> 07:45:09,180

9157
07:45:11,180 --> 07:45:13,180

Mimicking me

9161
07:45:27,180 --> 07:45:29,180

07:45:35,180 --> 07:45:37,180

07:45:39,180 --> 07:45:41,180
Are we just mimicking each other

9164
07:45:45,180 --> 07:45:47,180

9168
07:46:01,180 --> 07:46:03,180
Here

9169
07:46:03,180 --> 07:46:05,180
I don't know why I'm putting it

9170
07:46:05,180 --> 07:46:07,180
Here

9171
07:46:07,180 --> 07:46:09,180

9175
07:46:17,180 --> 07:46:19,180
Oh this is hard

9176
07:46:19,180 --> 07:46:21,180
I'm like touching my face

9177
07:46:21,180 --> 07:46:23,180
I don't think I can actually

9178
07:46:23,180 --> 07:46:25,180
Win against any of you guys

9179
07:46:27,180 --> 07:46:29,180

9180
07:46:29,180 --> 07:46:31,180
One two three

9181
07:46:31,180 --> 07:46:33,180
Maybe

9182
07:46:33,180 --> 07:46:35,180
Maybe if I stack

9183
07:46:35,180 --> 07:46:37,180

9184
07:46:37,180 --> 07:46:39,180

9190
07:47:03,180 --> 07:47:05,180
Wait

9191
07:47:05,180 --> 07:47:07,180
Wait you didn't mean that

9192
07:47:07,180 --> 07:47:09,180
Did you not see that

9193
07:47:13,180 --> 07:47:15,180
Huh

9194
07:47:15,180 --> 07:47:17,180
I can't tell

9195
07:47:17,180 --> 07:47:19,180
Did you mean that

9196
07:47:19,180 --> 07:47:21,180
Are you at the restaurant

9197
07:47:23,180 --> 07:47:25,180

9199
07:47:27,180 --> 07:47:29,180
Oh a little distraction

9200
07:47:29,180 --> 07:47:31,180
I have not played

9201
07:47:31,180 --> 07:47:33,180

9202
07:47:33,180 --> 07:47:35,180
Calls

9203
07:47:35,180 --> 07:47:37,180
Let me be green

9204
07:47:37,180 --> 07:47:39,180
So pretty

9205
07:47:39,180 --> 07:47:41,180

Okay

9215
07:47:59,180 --> 07:48:01,180
Using them cosmic rings

9216
07:48:01,180 --> 07:48:03,180
Flash your opponent to distract

9217
07:48:03,180 --> 07:48:05,180
Okay let me get the bikini toggle

9218
07:48:05,180 --> 07:48:07,180

Um

9224
07:48:19,180 --> 07:48:21,180
We should do like speedruns

9225
07:48:21,180 --> 07:48:23,180
We just have to slap them down

9226
07:48:23,180 --> 07:48:25,180
Okay

9227
07:48:27,180 --> 07:48:29,180

9228
07:48:31,180 --> 07:48:33,180

A little bit

9232
07:48:41,180 --> 07:48:43,180
A little bit but I'm allowed to mess up a little bit

9233
07:48:43,180 --> 07:48:45,180
And if I put it here

9234
07:48:45,180 --> 07:48:47,180

Oh no

9244
07:49:17,180 --> 07:49:19,180
Oh my god

9245
07:49:19,180 --> 07:49:21,180
You stress me so

9246
07:49:21,180 --> 07:49:23,180
So much

9247
07:49:23,180 --> 07:49:25,180
I don't know what to do

9248
07:49:25,180 --> 07:49:27,180
Shawnee go in the third column

9249
07:49:27,180 --> 07:49:29,180
No

9250
07:49:29,180 --> 07:49:31,180
He's gonna win

9251
07:49:31,180 --> 07:49:33,180
If I go in the third column

9252
07:49:33,180 --> 07:49:35,180
He'll go there

9253
07:49:35,180 --> 07:49:37,180
And he gets four in a row

9254
07:49:37,180 --> 07:49:39,180
None of us can play the third column

9255
07:49:39,180 --> 07:49:41,180
Cause if he plays the

9256
07:49:41,180 --> 07:49:43,180
Wait why did you do that

9257
07:49:43,180 --> 07:49:45,180
Why did you do that

9258
07:49:45,180 --> 07:49:47,180
Uh-huh

9259
07:49:47,180 --> 07:49:49,180
Did I distract you

9260
07:49:49,180 --> 07:49:51,180
Wait why did you do that

9261
07:49:51,180 --> 07:49:53,180
Did you mean that you win

9262
07:49:53,180 --> 07:49:55,180
You're right I'm blind

9263
07:49:55,180 --> 07:49:57,180
Uh-huh

9264
07:49:57,180 --> 07:49:59,180
I think you guys are just letting me win now

9265
07:49:59,180 --> 07:50:01,180
I'm gonna be honest

9266
07:50:01,180 --> 07:50:03,180
No matter where I went

9267
07:50:03,180 --> 07:50:05,180
You would have won

9268
07:50:05,180 --> 07:50:07,180
Oh really

9269
07:50:07,180 --> 07:50:09,180
Just Yummy I've not played you

9271
07:50:11,180 --> 07:50:13,180
Ah

9272
07:50:13,180 --> 07:50:15,180
What's this

9273
07:50:15,180 --> 07:50:17,180
What do I do

9274
07:50:19,180 --> 07:50:21,180
What

9275
07:50:23,180 --> 07:50:25,180
What is this

9276
07:50:27,180 --> 07:50:29,180
Oh no I don't know how to play checkers

9277
07:50:29,180 --> 07:50:31,180
Can I just mimic what he does

9278
07:50:31,180 --> 07:50:33,180
Just to annoy him

9279
07:50:33,180 --> 07:50:35,180
I don't know

9280
07:50:35,180 --> 07:50:37,180
I'm not playing this game

9281
07:50:37,180 --> 07:50:39,180
Wait

9282
07:50:39,180 --> 07:50:41,180
How did you do that

9283
07:50:41,180 --> 07:50:43,180
How did you get there

9284
07:50:43,180 --> 07:50:45,180
Yeah

9285
07:50:45,180 --> 07:50:47,180
That's right Reflin what are you gonna do

9286
07:50:47,180 --> 07:50:49,180

How did you do that

9290
07:50:57,180 --> 07:50:59,180
You went back up here

9291
07:51:01,180 --> 07:51:03,180
Right

9292
07:51:03,180 --> 07:51:05,180
I'll change my pattern

9293
07:51:05,180 --> 07:51:07,180
I won't cheat

9294
07:51:07,180 --> 07:51:09,180
I'll change my pattern

9295
07:51:09,180 --> 07:51:11,180
I don't know what I'm doing though

9296
07:51:11,180 --> 07:51:13,180
I think we're just playing

9297
07:51:13,180 --> 07:51:15,180
crisscross apple sauce

9298
07:51:15,180 --> 07:51:17,180
One of the coolest games ever

9299
07:51:17,180 --> 07:51:19,180
Losing all the rank and honestly

9300
07:51:19,180 --> 07:51:21,180
Yeah you actually played well

9301
07:51:21,180 --> 07:51:23,180

Oh no here sorry

9311
07:51:41,180 --> 07:51:43,180
More of them went green

9312
07:51:43,180 --> 07:51:45,180
I didn't even mean that

9313
07:51:45,180 --> 07:51:47,180
I don't know what this is

9314
07:51:47,180 --> 07:51:49,180
I'm having fun

9315
07:51:53,180 --> 07:51:55,180
Are we drawing Pipi

9316
07:51:55,180 --> 07:51:57,180
No

9317
07:51:57,180 --> 07:51:59,180
Did he do something here

9318
07:52:01,180 --> 07:52:03,180
That was juicy

9319
07:52:03,180 --> 07:52:05,180
Whatever that did

9320
07:52:09,180 --> 07:52:11,180
Okay Reflin made a move

9321
07:52:11,180 --> 07:52:13,180
I want to make a move here

9322
07:52:15,180 --> 07:52:17,180
Oh shite

9323
07:52:17,180 --> 07:52:19,180
I'm losing at me

9324
07:52:19,180 --> 07:52:21,180
Oh no what did I do

9325
07:52:21,180 --> 07:52:23,180

07:52:25,180 --> 07:52:27,180
Here

9328
07:52:27,180 --> 07:52:29,180
You know if I just click the board

9329
07:52:29,180 --> 07:52:31,180
Oh there we go there we go

9330
07:52:31,180 --> 07:52:33,180
Something changed

9331
07:52:33,180 --> 07:52:35,180
Taking mummy out of her element

9332
07:52:35,180 --> 07:52:37,180
Mixer here

9333
07:52:37,180 --> 07:52:39,180
I'm so dumb you're all gonna know I'm so dumb

9334
07:52:39,180 --> 07:52:41,180
It's not your turn

9335
07:52:41,180 --> 07:52:43,180
Okay

9336
07:52:43,180 --> 07:52:45,180
Shaisa

9337
07:52:45,180 --> 07:52:47,180
Shaisa yeah

07:52:47,180 --> 07:52:49,180
Oh no it's my turn

9339
07:52:49,180 --> 07:52:51,180
Can I go here

9340
07:52:51,180 --> 07:52:53,180
Can I go here?

9341
07:52:53,180 --> 07:52:55,180
Okay I can go there

9342
07:52:55,180 --> 07:52:57,180
Let him get open

9343
07:52:57,180 --> 07:52:59,180
Mmm

9344
07:52:59,180 --> 07:53:01,180
You have to signage the pieces to rent the player

9345
07:53:01,180 --> 07:53:03,180
Oh no what did he do

9346
07:53:03,180 --> 07:53:05,180
I wasn't paying attention

9347
07:53:05,180 --> 07:53:07,180
Can I go here? No

9348
07:53:07,180 --> 07:53:09,180
Oh I can! How did that work

9349
07:53:09,180 --> 07:53:11,180
I don't know how I did that

9350
07:53:11,180 --> 07:53:13,180
I'm warning you now Reflin

9351
07:53:13,180 --> 07:53:15,180
I'm taking this entire route

9352
07:53:15,180 --> 07:53:17,180
Fuck you I'm taking this route

9353
07:53:17,180 --> 07:53:19,180
How does this work

9354
07:53:19,180 --> 07:53:21,180
I don't know

9355
07:53:21,180 --> 07:53:23,180
This is the most confusing game

9356
07:53:23,180 --> 07:53:25,180
Oh it's my turn

9357
07:53:25,180 --> 07:53:27,180
I didn't even see what you changed

9358
07:53:27,180 --> 07:53:29,180
Here

9359
07:53:29,180 --> 07:53:31,180
Oh that was a terrible move

9360
07:53:31,180 --> 07:53:33,180
Here?

9361
07:53:33,180 --> 07:53:35,180
Okay that was a good move

9362
07:53:35,180 --> 07:53:37,180
Uhh

9363
07:53:39,180 --> 07:53:41,180
I'm not sure

9364
07:53:41,180 --> 07:53:43,180
He made that right up there

9365
07:53:43,180 --> 07:53:45,180
What does that mean for me

9366
07:53:45,180 --> 07:53:47,180
I don't know

9367
07:53:47,180 --> 07:53:49,180
Can I do this?

9368
07:53:49,180 --> 07:53:51,180
I can do that

9369
07:53:51,180 --> 07:53:53,180
I'm just clicking on the board

9370
07:53:53,180 --> 07:53:55,180
I'm going to be honest

9371
07:53:55,180 --> 07:53:57,180
Stony can you hear

9372
07:53:57,180 --> 07:53:59,180
your thick accent for a little bit

9373
07:53:59,180 --> 07:54:01,180
I'm dying to hear it

9374
07:54:01,180 --> 07:54:03,180
Oh you can't

9375
07:54:03,180 --> 07:54:05,180
Oh no

9376
07:54:05,180 --> 07:54:07,180
Oh no

9377
07:54:09,180 --> 07:54:11,180
I want here

9378
07:54:11,180 --> 07:54:13,180
Okay thank you

9379
07:54:13,180 --> 07:54:15,180
I got here

9380
07:54:15,180 --> 07:54:17,180
Uh

9381
07:54:17,180 --> 07:54:19,180
Is he

9382
07:54:19,180 --> 07:54:21,180
your turn

9383
07:54:21,180 --> 07:54:23,180
God this checkers game is hard

9384
07:54:25,180 --> 07:54:27,180
Oh I think I messed up

9385
07:54:27,180 --> 07:54:29,180
I maybe shouldn't have played that

9386
07:54:29,180 --> 07:54:31,180
Oh no

9387
07:54:33,180 --> 07:54:35,180
Umm

9388
07:54:37,180 --> 07:54:39,180
Who's with us at night

9389
07:54:39,180 --> 07:54:41,180
I don't even know if this Reflin

9390
07:54:41,180 --> 07:54:43,180
knows what he's doing

9391
07:54:43,180 --> 07:54:45,180
If you are this cute when playing

9392
07:54:45,180 --> 07:54:47,180
Uhh

9393
07:54:47,180 --> 07:54:49,180
Oh that love heart solo

9394
07:54:49,180 --> 07:54:51,180
Corners are power spots

9395
07:54:51,180 --> 07:54:53,180
When playing I can agree on chess and during stream

9396
07:54:53,180 --> 07:54:55,180
I'm too dumb for connect 4

9397
07:54:55,180 --> 07:54:57,180
Is it my turn yet? Oh no it's not

9398
07:54:57,180 --> 07:54:59,180
Okay now it's my turn

9399
07:54:59,180 --> 07:55:01,180

9400
07:55:01,180 --> 07:55:03,180

9401
07:55:03,180 --> 07:55:05,180
Oh no you two back

9402
07:55:05,180 --> 07:55:07,180
Wait how do I take it back

9403
07:55:07,180 --> 07:55:09,180
No give me back give me that

9404
07:55:09,180 --> 07:55:11,180
That's mine

9405
07:55:11,180 --> 07:55:13,180
Stop you're taking

9406
07:55:13,180 --> 07:55:15,180
Oh no

9407
07:55:15,180 --> 07:55:17,180
That didn't do anything

9408
07:55:17,180 --> 07:55:19,180
Oh no

9409
07:55:19,180 --> 07:55:21,180
I think I'm losing

9410
07:55:21,180 --> 07:55:23,180
What does that do

9411
07:55:23,180 --> 07:55:25,180
Like this

9412
07:55:25,180 --> 07:55:27,180
Does that do something

9413
07:55:27,180 --> 07:55:29,180
I don't know what I'm doing

9414
07:55:29,180 --> 07:55:31,180
I think I might

9415
07:55:31,180 --> 07:55:33,180
I think we have to admit defeat unfortunately

9416
07:55:33,180 --> 07:55:35,180
Oh I'm getting ruled

9417
07:55:35,180 --> 07:55:37,180
Everything's getting taken

9418
07:55:37,180 --> 07:55:41,180
I don't have the strength

9419
07:55:41,180 --> 07:55:43,180
Reflins I'm doing so bad

9420
07:55:47,180 --> 07:55:49,180
Uh

9421
07:55:49,180 --> 07:55:51,180
Connect your pieces

9422
07:55:51,180 --> 07:55:53,180
Oh corner someone says corner

9423
07:55:53,180 --> 07:55:55,180
I'll play the corner

9424
07:55:55,180 --> 07:55:57,180
Oh sugar that didn't do anything

9425
07:55:57,180 --> 07:55:59,180
Oh no

9426
07:55:59,180 --> 07:56:01,180
We are

9427
07:56:01,180 --> 07:56:03,180
Okay green green I see green

9428
07:56:03,180 --> 07:56:05,180
Green

9429
07:56:05,180 --> 07:56:07,180
Uh but that turn green

9430
07:56:07,180 --> 07:56:09,180
A little bit green

9431
07:56:11,180 --> 07:56:13,180
I guess it's like splatoon where you want

9432
07:56:13,180 --> 07:56:15,180
Everything to be your colors

9433
07:56:15,180 --> 07:56:17,180
Oh that didn't do anything oops

9434
07:56:17,180 --> 07:56:19,180
I think I just threw that

9435
07:56:19,180 --> 07:56:21,180
You lose the board just filled

9436
07:56:21,180 --> 07:56:23,180
Oh no that was so hard

9437
07:56:23,180 --> 07:56:25,180
That was confusing

9438
07:56:25,180 --> 07:56:27,180
Uh maybe we

9439
07:56:27,180 --> 07:56:29,180
Only do the other one

9440
07:56:29,180 --> 07:56:31,180
Oh Amy wants to play yeah sure

9441
07:56:31,180 --> 07:56:33,180
Amy will play

9442
07:56:35,180 --> 07:56:37,180
Amy's turn

9443
07:56:37,180 --> 07:56:39,180
I have never played it before either I'm dumb

9444
07:56:39,180 --> 07:56:41,180
Right Amy you're getting ruled

9445
07:56:41,180 --> 07:56:43,180
I'm going here Amy

9446
07:56:43,180 --> 07:56:45,180
And you're not going to have a clue

9447
07:56:45,180 --> 07:56:47,180
What's going to hit you because I'm so good at this game

9448
07:56:49,180 --> 07:56:51,180

9449

9451
07:57:15,180 --> 07:57:17,180
What are you thinking

9452
07:57:17,180 --> 07:57:19,180
I'm trying to get in your head

9453
07:57:19,180 --> 07:57:21,180
Or actually you're a pen pal

9454
07:57:21,180 --> 07:57:23,180
What were you doing pen pal

9455
07:57:23,180 --> 07:57:25,180
Are you trying to embarrass me

9456
07:57:25,180 --> 07:57:27,180
Oh shit you're about to get that

9457
07:57:27,180 --> 07:57:29,180
Oh what

9458
07:57:29,180 --> 07:57:31,180
How did you do that

9459
07:57:31,180 --> 07:57:33,180
I never even saw that

9460
07:57:33,180 --> 07:57:35,180
That was like my fastest freaking law

9461
07:57:35,180 --> 07:57:37,180
Pen pals are ruling me

9462
07:57:37,180 --> 07:57:39,180
I never saw that at all

9463
07:57:39,180 --> 07:57:41,180
I was too busy focusing on my little right side play there

9464
07:57:41,180 --> 07:57:43,180
You've not played against you yet

9465
07:57:43,180 --> 07:57:45,180
I'm going green

9466
07:57:47,180 --> 07:57:49,180
Your turn first

9467
07:57:51,180 --> 07:57:53,180
Uh okay I'm going here this time

9468
07:57:55,180 --> 07:57:57,180

9469
07:57:59,180 --> 07:58:01,180
And then

9470
07:58:01,180 --> 07:58:03,180
And then

9471
07:58:03,180 --> 07:58:05,180
No you're not supposed to do that

9472
07:58:05,180 --> 07:58:07,180
You're supposed to let me win

9473
07:58:09,180 --> 07:58:11,180
Um

9474
07:58:11,180 --> 07:58:13,180

07:58:17,180 --> 07:58:19,180
I'm going to just do this

9478
07:58:21,180 --> 07:58:23,180
I think I've already lost

9479
07:58:23,180 --> 07:58:25,180
We didn't even start to do it

9480
07:58:25,180 --> 07:58:27,180
I think I lost

9481
07:58:27,180 --> 07:58:29,180
I'm not supposed to see my

9482
07:58:29,180 --> 07:58:31,180
MLG pro moves

9483
07:58:41,180 --> 07:58:43,180
I don't know what I'm doing

9484
07:58:43,180 --> 07:58:45,180
Oh no

9485
07:58:45,180 --> 07:58:47,180
Oh no

9486
07:58:49,180 --> 07:58:51,180
Oh no

9487
07:58:51,180 --> 07:58:53,180
I lost

9488
07:58:53,180 --> 07:58:55,180
I never saw that

9489
07:58:57,180 --> 07:58:59,180
Womp womp

9490
07:58:59,180 --> 07:59:01,180
Wait you didn't see that

9491
07:59:01,180 --> 07:59:03,180
Oh no you can win anyway like double time

9492
07:59:03,180 --> 07:59:05,180
Yeah I was going to say you already won

9493
07:59:05,180 --> 07:59:07,180
You could have won down here

9494
07:59:09,180 --> 07:59:11,180
Wow this is so hard

9495
07:59:11,180 --> 07:59:13,180
I don't know how people play this

9496
07:59:13,180 --> 07:59:15,180
Anymore of these things

9497
07:59:15,180 --> 07:59:17,180
I want to play

9498
07:59:17,180 --> 07:59:19,180
I'm not playing you again

9499
07:59:21,180 --> 07:59:23,180
Oh wait I might miss that

9500
07:59:23,180 --> 07:59:25,180
You can't do that here

9501
07:59:25,180 --> 07:59:27,180
I'm sorry I need to like come in the area

9502
07:59:27,180 --> 07:59:29,180

Right

9506
07:59:35,180 --> 07:59:37,180
Maybe

9507
07:59:37,180 --> 07:59:39,180
You win

9508
07:59:39,180 --> 07:59:41,180
Another player resigned

9509
07:59:41,180 --> 07:59:43,180
Did you mean that

9510
07:59:43,180 --> 07:59:45,180
I don't think you meant that

9511
07:59:45,180 --> 07:59:47,180
Do you want to try again

9512
07:59:47,180 --> 07:59:49,180
Okay there we go

9513
07:59:49,180 --> 07:59:51,180
The other player is busy

9514
07:59:51,180 --> 07:59:53,180
Wait what

9515
07:59:53,180 --> 07:59:55,180
Alright let me be green

What are you planning

9529
08:00:33,180 --> 08:00:35,180
No what are you planning

9530
08:00:35,180 --> 08:00:37,180
What does it mean

9531
08:00:39,180 --> 08:00:41,180
I don't know

9532
08:00:41,180 --> 08:00:43,180
How do this

9533
08:00:47,180 --> 08:00:49,180
No you're not supposed to go there

9534
08:00:49,180 --> 08:00:51,180
This is hard

9535
08:00:55,180 --> 08:00:57,180

Let me win

9539
08:01:03,180 --> 08:01:05,180

9540
08:01:05,180 --> 08:01:07,180
No

9541
08:01:07,180 --> 08:01:09,180
I don't want to put it down

9542
08:01:09,180 --> 08:01:11,180
Stop it

9543
08:01:11,180 --> 08:01:13,180
You're teasing me

9544
08:01:13,180 --> 08:01:15,180
Stop it no wait

9545
08:01:15,180 --> 08:01:17,180

No I want to win

9547
08:01:21,180 --> 08:01:23,180
I want to win

9548
08:01:25,180 --> 08:01:27,180
No

9549
08:01:27,180 --> 08:01:29,180
Come on

9550
08:01:29,180 --> 08:01:31,180
Why is this game so hard

9551
08:01:33,180 --> 08:01:35,180
Why is it so hard

9552
08:01:35,180 --> 08:01:37,180
This is terrible

9553
08:01:37,180 --> 08:01:39,180
Alright cool again

9554
08:01:39,180 --> 08:01:41,180
There has to be one reefling in here that's called lower IQ than me

9555
08:01:41,180 --> 08:01:43,180
Come on

9556
08:01:43,180 --> 08:01:45,180
I've not played through yet

9557
08:01:45,180 --> 08:01:47,180
There has to be a reefling

9558
08:01:47,180 --> 08:01:49,180
That has a lower IQ

9559
08:01:49,180 --> 08:01:51,180
What the heck is this

9560
08:01:51,180 --> 08:01:53,180
What do I do

9561
08:01:53,180 --> 08:01:55,180
Examine

9562
08:01:55,180 --> 08:01:57,180
What

9563
08:01:57,180 --> 08:01:59,180
I don't know what to do

9564
08:02:01,180 --> 08:02:03,180
I click it

9565
08:02:03,180 --> 08:02:05,180
Wait it's not let me do anything

9566
08:02:07,180 --> 08:02:09,180
Huh

9567
08:02:09,180 --> 08:02:11,180
It's not let me do anything

9568
08:02:11,180 --> 08:02:13,180
Hello

9569
08:02:13,180 --> 08:02:15,180
Examine board game piece

9570
08:02:17,180 --> 08:02:19,180
Huh

9571
08:02:19,180 --> 08:02:21,180
You move and jump diagonally

9572
08:02:21,180 --> 08:02:23,180
Oh

9573
08:02:23,180 --> 08:02:25,180
Okay okay

9574
08:02:25,180 --> 08:02:27,180
You hold it and then drop it

9575
08:02:27,180 --> 08:02:29,180
Wait I'm getting pranked

9576
08:02:29,180 --> 08:02:31,180
Why

9577
08:02:31,180 --> 08:02:33,180
Why am I getting pranked

9578
08:02:33,180 --> 08:02:35,180
What what what happened

9579
08:02:35,180 --> 08:02:37,180
Wait

9580
08:02:37,180 --> 08:02:39,180
No

9581
08:02:39,180 --> 08:02:41,180
What

9582
08:02:41,180 --> 08:02:43,180
I think it's a bit laggy

9583
08:02:45,180 --> 08:02:47,180
Can I just start moving them everywhere

9584
08:02:47,180 --> 08:02:49,180
No

9585
08:02:49,180 --> 08:02:51,180
I'm sorry

9586
08:02:53,180 --> 08:02:55,180
Okay wait

9587
08:02:55,180 --> 08:02:57,180
I can't move them

9588
08:02:57,180 --> 08:02:59,180
No

9589
08:02:59,180 --> 08:03:01,180
So I move you

9590
08:03:01,180 --> 08:03:03,180
What the heck

9591
08:03:07,180 --> 08:03:09,180
Then you block me

9592
08:03:09,180 --> 08:03:11,180
So I block you

9593
08:03:13,180 --> 08:03:15,180
What

9594
08:03:21,180 --> 08:03:23,180
Huh

9595
08:03:25,180 --> 08:03:27,180
Huh

9596
08:03:29,180 --> 08:03:31,180
Can I go back

9597
08:03:31,180 --> 08:03:33,180
A legal move

9598
08:03:33,180 --> 08:03:35,180
Bro I don't even know the rule book

9599
08:03:35,180 --> 08:03:37,180
I don't want to get jailed

9600
08:03:39,180 --> 08:03:41,180
No

9601
08:03:41,180 --> 08:03:43,180
And what

9602
08:03:43,180 --> 08:03:45,180
Like this

9603
08:03:45,180 --> 08:03:47,180
No I can't

9604
08:03:47,180 --> 08:03:49,180
Can I maybe

9605
08:03:49,180 --> 08:03:51,180
I don't

9606
08:03:51,180 --> 08:03:53,180
Wait what

9607
08:03:53,180 --> 08:03:55,180
Like this

9608
08:03:55,180 --> 08:03:57,180
Okay that was a load

9609
08:03:57,180 --> 08:03:59,180
Why are some things loaded not

9610
08:04:03,180 --> 08:04:05,180
Oh

9611
08:04:05,180 --> 08:04:07,180
Uh

9612
08:04:07,180 --> 08:04:09,180
In the name of the checkers board

9613
08:04:09,180 --> 08:04:11,180
Wait I can't do that

9614
08:04:11,180 --> 08:04:13,180
Hold in the name of the checkers

9615
08:04:13,180 --> 08:04:15,180
Hold in the name of the checkers board

9616
08:04:15,180 --> 08:04:17,180
Hold in the name of the checkers board

9617
08:04:17,180 --> 08:04:19,180
What

9618
08:04:19,180 --> 08:04:21,180
This is crazy

9619
08:04:23,180 --> 08:04:25,180
I'm sorry my little brain can't

9620
08:04:25,180 --> 08:04:27,180
Do this

9621
08:04:27,180 --> 08:04:29,180
Maybe we just play the four in a row

9622
08:04:29,180 --> 08:04:31,180
You can only move one tail

9623
08:04:31,180 --> 08:04:33,180
If you're jumping over an enemy

9624
08:04:33,180 --> 08:04:35,180
As many times as you can

9625
08:04:35,180 --> 08:04:37,180
What happened

9626
08:04:37,180 --> 08:04:39,180
Something happens

9627
08:04:41,180 --> 08:04:43,180
You can only jump a tail

9628
08:04:43,180 --> 08:04:45,180
So here

9629
08:04:45,180 --> 08:04:47,180
No

9630
08:04:47,180 --> 08:04:49,180
It's not your turn oh sorry

9631
08:04:49,180 --> 08:04:51,180
What and then do that

9632
08:04:51,180 --> 08:04:53,180
What the heck

9633
08:04:55,180 --> 08:04:57,180
Am I accidentally winning right now

9634
08:04:59,180 --> 08:05:01,180
I might be

9635
08:05:01,180 --> 08:05:03,180
It's plausible

9636
08:05:03,180 --> 08:05:05,180
Oh you can't go back you can only go up

9637
08:05:05,180 --> 08:05:07,180
Okay

9638
08:05:07,180 --> 08:05:09,180
Wait they didn't do anything

9639
08:05:11,180 --> 08:05:13,180
Can you be like gridlocked in this game

9640
08:05:15,180 --> 08:05:17,180
Yes

9641
08:05:19,180 --> 08:05:21,180
Uh sure go up there then

9642
08:05:21,180 --> 08:05:23,180
Wow what am I doing

9643
08:05:23,180 --> 08:05:25,180
I can't go back

9644
08:05:25,180 --> 08:05:27,180
If you reach the end of the board

9645
08:05:27,180 --> 08:05:29,180
You get knighted

9646
08:05:29,180 --> 08:05:31,180
Oh

9647
08:05:31,180 --> 08:05:33,180
Oh no he won

9648
08:05:35,180 --> 08:05:37,180
I lost again

9649
08:05:39,180 --> 08:05:41,180
Reflames

9650
08:05:41,180 --> 08:05:43,180
Oh my god

9651
08:05:43,180 --> 08:05:45,180
I don't know what I'm saying

9652
08:05:45,180 --> 08:05:47,180
No he won

9653
08:05:47,180 --> 08:05:49,180
I can't go back

9654
08:05:49,180 --> 08:05:51,180
And won't let me go back on him

9655
08:05:55,180 --> 08:05:57,180
Right okay what can I do

9656
08:05:57,180 --> 08:05:59,180
I can't even go forward or anything

9657
08:05:59,180 --> 08:06:01,180
I just did that

9658
08:06:01,180 --> 08:06:03,180
Game ends when all the pieces are taken

9659
08:06:03,180 --> 08:06:05,180
How can they be taken

9660
08:06:05,180 --> 08:06:07,180
We can't go backwards

9661
08:06:07,180 --> 08:06:09,180
I don't get it

9662
08:06:09,180 --> 08:06:11,180
I'm so confused

9663
08:06:11,180 --> 08:06:13,180
He's not won yet

9664
08:06:13,180 --> 08:06:15,180
What

9665
08:06:15,180 --> 08:06:17,180
I don't know what's going on

9666
08:06:19,180 --> 08:06:21,180
Wait so if he comes here

9667
08:06:21,180 --> 08:06:23,180
I can only jump forward one

9668
08:06:23,180 --> 08:06:25,180
Oh

9669
08:06:27,180 --> 08:06:29,180
This is too hard

9670
08:06:29,180 --> 08:06:31,180
Oh no what happened

9671
08:06:31,180 --> 08:06:33,180
Something changed

9672
08:06:33,180 --> 08:06:35,180
I don't know

9673
08:06:35,180 --> 08:06:37,180
So I can't go backwards

9674
08:06:37,180 --> 08:06:39,180
I can only go forward

9675
08:06:39,180 --> 08:06:41,180
Well then I might as well push forward then

9676
08:06:41,180 --> 08:06:43,180
Surely

9677
08:06:43,180 --> 08:06:45,180
Surely that's how it works

9678
08:06:47,180 --> 08:06:49,180
Okay

9679
08:06:49,180 --> 08:06:51,180
And now then I take you

9680
08:06:51,180 --> 08:06:53,180
No I can't take you

9681
08:06:53,180 --> 08:06:55,180
You're too far away from me

9682
08:06:57,180 --> 08:06:59,180
Then I push you forward

9683
08:06:59,180 --> 08:07:01,180
To play

9684
08:07:01,180 --> 08:07:03,180
I guess

9685
08:07:03,180 --> 08:07:05,180
No I don't one at a time

9686
08:07:05,180 --> 08:07:07,180
Sorry one move at a time

9687
08:07:07,180 --> 08:07:09,180
Apologies one step

9688
08:07:09,180 --> 08:07:11,180
Oh this is so hard

9689
08:07:11,180 --> 08:07:13,180
Oh no my guy got taken

9690
08:07:13,180 --> 08:07:15,180
Wait how do you

9691
08:07:15,180 --> 08:07:17,180
So I can only go one way

9692
08:07:17,180 --> 08:07:19,180
Then that would push

9693
08:07:19,180 --> 08:07:21,180
What that pushes him there

9694
08:07:21,180 --> 08:07:23,180
And then I can't push up so I need to do that

9695
08:07:23,180 --> 08:07:25,180
Oh no that blocks him

9696
08:07:25,180 --> 08:07:27,180
Oh I didn't mean to do that

9697
08:07:29,180 --> 08:07:31,180
What does a knight do

9698
08:07:31,180 --> 08:07:33,180
I don't know

9699
08:07:33,180 --> 08:07:35,180
I'm not sure

9700
08:07:35,180 --> 08:07:37,180
Can he take everything now

9701
08:07:41,180 --> 08:07:43,180
And then can go backwards

9702
08:07:43,180 --> 08:07:45,180
Oh wait

9703
08:07:45,180 --> 08:07:47,180
So I just need to move him forward

9704
08:07:47,180 --> 08:07:49,180
Like here

9705
08:07:49,180 --> 08:07:51,180
Okay I'll push him forward

9706
08:07:51,180 --> 08:07:53,180
Oh he got taken

9707
08:07:53,180 --> 08:07:55,180
Wait hold on I'll push him forward then

9708
08:07:55,180 --> 08:07:57,180
Wait am I going to perish

9709
08:07:57,180 --> 08:07:59,180
I think I'm going to perish

9710
08:07:59,180 --> 08:08:01,180
I don't think I can win

9711
08:08:01,180 --> 08:08:03,180
And then you move up

9712
08:08:03,180 --> 08:08:05,180
Oh no I didn't mean that

9713
08:08:07,180 --> 08:08:09,180
And then I push up

9714
08:08:09,180 --> 08:08:11,180
And then what

9715
08:08:11,180 --> 08:08:13,180
What happens then

9716
08:08:13,180 --> 08:08:15,180
In the head

9717
08:08:15,180 --> 08:08:17,180
Yeah I'm not winning that one

9718
08:08:17,180 --> 08:08:19,180
Okay let's try again

9719
08:08:19,180 --> 08:08:21,180
That was

9720
08:08:21,180 --> 08:08:23,180
Yeah that was

9721
08:08:23,180 --> 08:08:25,180
I wasn't sure about that one

9722
08:08:25,180 --> 08:08:27,180
I'm not sure about that one

9723
08:08:27,180 --> 08:08:29,180
Run Riefling

9724
08:08:29,180 --> 08:08:31,180
I don't think I've played with you yet

9725
08:08:33,180 --> 08:08:35,180
Okay surely I can win

9726
08:08:35,180 --> 08:08:37,180
Oh it's not my turn yet

9727
08:08:37,180 --> 08:08:39,180
Oops

9728
08:08:39,180 --> 08:08:41,180
Okay you

9729
08:08:41,180 --> 08:08:43,180
You are getting

9730
08:08:43,180 --> 08:08:45,180
Blyat

9731
08:08:45,180 --> 08:08:47,180
Can't handle it

9732
08:08:57,180 --> 08:08:59,180
Block you from doing it there

9733
08:09:01,180 --> 08:09:03,180
I'll take you

9734
08:09:07,180 --> 08:09:09,180
Oh no this Riefling is thinking

9735
08:09:09,180 --> 08:09:11,180
You're not supposed to think against me

9736
08:09:13,180 --> 08:09:15,180
Monka

9737
08:09:15,180 --> 08:09:17,180
What's this Riefling thinking

9738
08:09:17,180 --> 08:09:19,180
I don't know he's taking his time

9739
08:09:19,180 --> 08:09:21,180
I'm getting nervous

9740
08:09:21,180 --> 08:09:23,180
I'm getting nervous

9741
08:09:23,180 --> 08:09:25,180
What he's planning

9742
08:09:25,180 --> 08:09:27,180
I don't know what he's doing

9743
08:09:27,180 --> 08:09:29,180
I can't see it if he's doing something

9744
08:09:31,180 --> 08:09:33,180
I don't see it

9745
08:09:33,180 --> 08:09:35,180
Here

9746
08:09:35,180 --> 08:09:37,180
I don't know what Riefling is planning

9747
08:09:37,180 --> 08:09:39,180
Riefling is planning

9748
08:09:43,180 --> 08:09:45,180
I'll take that then

9749
08:09:45,180 --> 08:09:47,180
You're not getting a 4 in the rule of me

9750
08:09:47,180 --> 08:09:49,180
I don't know

9751
08:09:49,180 --> 08:09:51,180
If I do this

9752
08:09:51,180 --> 08:09:53,180
No

9753
08:09:55,180 --> 08:09:57,180
I block you

9754
08:09:57,180 --> 08:09:59,180
Then what

9755
08:09:59,180 --> 08:10:01,180
Riefling

9756
08:10:05,180 --> 08:10:07,180
What the heck

9757
08:10:09,180 --> 08:10:11,180
No you weren't supposed to see

9758
08:10:11,180 --> 08:10:13,180
You're supposed to be like

9759
08:10:13,180 --> 08:10:15,180
La-dee-da-dee-da

9760
08:10:15,180 --> 08:10:17,180
Strawny is too dumb to figure this out

9761
08:10:21,180 --> 08:10:23,180
Okay

9762
08:10:23,180 --> 08:10:25,180
So now what

9763
08:10:25,180 --> 08:10:27,180
Are you gonna put it there

9764
08:10:27,180 --> 08:10:29,180
No he's gonna put it there

9765
08:10:29,180 --> 08:10:31,180
Wait hold on

9766
08:10:31,180 --> 08:10:33,180
1 2 3 3 3

9767
08:10:33,180 --> 08:10:35,180
So if I put it there

9768
08:10:35,180 --> 08:10:37,180
He has to go there

9769
08:10:39,180 --> 08:10:41,180
Will she finally get the dub

9770
08:10:41,180 --> 08:10:43,180
I have no idea

9771
08:10:43,180 --> 08:10:45,180
There has to be a Riefling that's lower IQ than me

9772
08:10:45,180 --> 08:10:47,180
Wait you block me

9773
08:10:49,180 --> 08:10:51,180
Oh sugar

9774
08:10:51,180 --> 08:10:53,180
I wasn't supposed to do that

9775
08:10:53,180 --> 08:10:55,180
Oopsies I foiled my own plan

9776
08:10:55,180 --> 08:10:57,180
Literally you don't even need to

9777
08:10:57,180 --> 08:10:59,180
Counteract me I counteract myself

9778
08:11:03,180 --> 08:11:05,180
You already beat me

9779
08:11:05,180 --> 08:11:07,180
Strawny my IQ is too low

9780
08:11:07,180 --> 08:11:09,180
This is hard

9781
08:11:09,180 --> 08:11:11,180
You're kicked

9782
08:11:11,180 --> 08:11:13,180
It's so bad

9783
08:11:13,180 --> 08:11:15,180
Wait we'll have 1 2

9784
08:11:15,180 --> 08:11:17,180
4 you can't

9785
08:11:17,180 --> 08:11:19,180
So never

9786
08:11:21,180 --> 08:11:23,180
No

9787
08:11:23,180 --> 08:11:25,180
I'm so confused

9788
08:11:33,180 --> 08:11:35,180
Are we both playing the same game right now

9789
08:11:37,180 --> 08:11:39,180
We're both scared to play here

9790
08:11:39,180 --> 08:11:41,180
Cause I win if he plays here

9791
08:11:43,180 --> 08:11:45,180
Oh no

9792
08:11:47,180 --> 08:11:49,180
Oh I wasn't freaking

9793
08:11:49,180 --> 08:11:51,180
Bro what is this game so

9794
08:11:51,180 --> 08:11:53,180
Freakin hard to win

9795
08:11:53,180 --> 08:11:55,180
Honestly

9796
08:11:55,180 --> 08:11:57,180
All of us

9797
08:11:57,180 --> 08:11:59,180
Literally

9798
08:11:59,180 --> 08:12:01,180
How are you all smarter than me

9799
08:12:01,180 --> 08:12:03,180
This doesn't make any sense

9800
08:12:03,180 --> 08:12:05,180
How are you so freaking smart

9801
08:12:09,180 --> 08:12:11,180
Bro how is this game so hard

9802
08:12:13,180 --> 08:12:15,180
You could have won

9803
08:12:15,180 --> 08:12:17,180
Just placed it in the middle

9804
08:12:17,180 --> 08:12:19,180
No he was gonna block me

9805
08:12:21,180 --> 08:12:23,180
No

9806
08:12:23,180 --> 08:12:25,180
Surely I can win one

9807
08:12:25,180 --> 08:12:27,180
Surely freaking temples I can win one

9808
08:12:27,180 --> 08:12:29,180
One faking

9809
08:12:29,180 --> 08:12:31,180
Round

9810
08:12:31,180 --> 08:12:33,180
Of this this is so hard

9811
08:12:33,180 --> 08:12:35,180
It's cause we're

9812
08:12:35,180 --> 08:12:37,180
It's cause we're men

9813
08:12:37,180 --> 08:12:39,180
Riefling you can't say that part

9814
08:12:39,180 --> 08:12:41,180
That's supposed to be the quiet part

9815
08:12:45,180 --> 08:12:47,180
Breed and honest I was barely screaming

9816
08:12:47,180 --> 08:12:49,180

08:14:43,180 --> 08:14:45,180
I'm ready for Friday.

9850
08:14:46,180 --> 08:14:49,180
Okay, I'm going to be eating and doing this at the same time.

9851
08:14:49,180 --> 08:14:51,180
So you must forgive me if I'm extra dumb.

9852
08:14:51,180 --> 08:14:54,180
Thank you the tonnethou for the two.

9853
08:14:54,180 --> 08:14:56,180
I'm currently getting wrecked at RuneScape.

9854
08:14:57,180 --> 08:15:00,180
It's not looking good. How do I counteract this?

9855
08:15:00,180 --> 08:15:02,180
I need to go here.

9856
08:15:05,180 --> 08:15:09,180
And then I need to stop you from making a four over here.

9857
08:15:10,180 --> 08:15:12,180
This is such a big...

9858
08:15:13,180 --> 08:15:18,180
I got a chicken wrap with sugar.

9859
08:15:18,180 --> 08:15:20,180
Why are you so tall?

9860
08:15:20,180 --> 08:15:22,180
I feel like I'm going to lose this one as well.

9861
08:15:22,180 --> 08:15:24,180
You feel like I can't do it?

9862
08:15:26,180 --> 08:15:29,180
Oh my god, I'm eating chips and it's so good.

9863
08:15:31,180 --> 08:15:33,180
It's so yummy.

9864
08:15:37,180 --> 08:15:39,180
Chicken wrap with sugar?

9865
08:15:40,180 --> 08:15:42,180
Wait, is that a thing?

9866
08:15:42,180 --> 08:15:44,180
No, it's just a chicken burrito wrap.

9867
08:15:45,180 --> 08:15:47,180
Oh no, this is a lot of red.

9868
08:15:47,180 --> 08:15:50,180
I don't like it. I see red, I see red, I see red.

9869
08:15:51,180 --> 08:15:53,180
Here?

9870
08:15:54,180 --> 08:15:56,180
I don't know what I'm doing.

9871
08:16:00,180 --> 08:16:02,180
I'm too busy munching.

9872
08:16:03,180 --> 08:16:05,180
Delicious.

9873
08:16:06,180 --> 08:16:08,180
I said sugar. Oh, I said oh sugar.

9874
08:16:08,180 --> 08:16:10,180
I said oh sugar instead of oh.

9875
08:16:13,180 --> 08:16:16,180
I'll stop you right there criminal scum.

9876
08:16:23,180 --> 08:16:25,180
I'm not going to mess this up.

9877
08:16:25,180 --> 08:16:27,180
No, you're going to play there.

9878
08:16:27,180 --> 08:16:29,180
What? How do you not play there?

9879
08:16:33,180 --> 08:16:37,180
No, you smell my fricking connection.

9880
08:16:38,180 --> 08:16:40,180
I don't really want to place it there.

9881
08:16:43,180 --> 08:16:47,180
I wasn't even paying attention.

9882
08:16:47,180 --> 08:16:50,180
No, come on man.

9883
08:16:50,180 --> 08:16:53,180
Come on, I'm getting rolled.

9884
08:16:53,180 --> 08:16:55,180
Are you squiddling me?

9885
08:16:55,180 --> 08:16:56,180
Who do you please me?

9886
08:16:56,180 --> 08:16:58,180
Please share, mama.

9887
08:16:58,180 --> 08:17:00,180
Oh, you guys not Ian, thank you for the tip boy.

9888
08:17:00,180 --> 08:17:02,180
You guys not Ian, you want to go ah?

9889
08:17:03,180 --> 08:17:05,180
I'm not pleased you.

9890
08:17:06,180 --> 08:17:10,180
You win.

9891
08:17:10,180 --> 08:17:12,180
Oh, you didn't mean that.

9892
08:17:15,180 --> 08:17:17,180
Sniffer, sniffer Ian.

9893
08:17:19,180 --> 08:17:23,180
Everyone's are going to starve because we're getting so distracted trying to win.

9894
08:17:23,180 --> 08:17:25,180
Why did I not work?

9895
08:17:30,180 --> 08:17:32,180
Here. Oh no.

9896
08:17:32,180 --> 08:17:34,180
I'm blue.

9897
08:17:34,180 --> 08:17:37,180
Abba de abba die, I'm blue.

9898
08:17:37,180 --> 08:17:40,180
I would be off a guy.

9899
08:17:40,180 --> 08:17:43,180
Now listen up, here's the story.

9900
08:17:43,180 --> 08:17:48,180
I found a little cuttlefish in the deep blue sea.

9901
08:17:48,180 --> 08:17:52,180
Everything was blue and visited the minimum.

9902
08:17:52,180 --> 08:17:55,180
Yeah, nobody to listen.

9903
08:17:55,180 --> 08:18:00,180
I knew I would meet up a guy.

9904
08:18:05,180 --> 08:18:08,180
Wow, it's cold on my hands.

9905
08:18:08,180 --> 08:18:10,180
That guy literally.

9906
08:18:14,180 --> 08:18:17,180
Hold on, I'm getting my burrito at my weebops.

9907
08:18:21,180 --> 08:18:23,180
I can't do that.

9908
08:18:24,180 --> 08:18:26,180
I need to do that, don't know.

9909
08:18:26,180 --> 08:18:28,180
I do, I do.

9910
08:18:30,180 --> 08:18:31,180
Oh no.

9911
08:18:31,180 --> 08:18:34,180
You're not supposed to do that, I'm going to hear them.

9912
08:18:34,180 --> 08:18:36,180
Yeah wait, far.

9913
08:18:38,180 --> 08:18:41,180
No, you're not supposed to win against me.

9914
08:18:43,180 --> 08:18:45,180
Okay, I'm opening up my burrito.

9915
08:18:45,180 --> 08:18:48,180
My burrito with no cilantro.

9916
08:18:48,180 --> 08:18:51,180
Because we do not like cilantro on the top.

9917
08:18:52,180 --> 08:18:54,180
Wow, oh yeah, hold on.

9918
08:18:56,180 --> 08:18:58,180
Oh no, what is this?

9919
08:18:59,180 --> 08:19:04,180
Mmm, oh my god, it's delicious.

9920
08:19:04,180 --> 08:19:07,180
Oh shiisa, shiisa.

9921
08:19:07,180 --> 08:19:10,180
He's doing that, he's gunning for that.

9922
08:19:10,180 --> 08:19:13,180
I can tell Riefland, I can see right through your thought process right now.

9923
08:19:13,180 --> 08:19:15,180
No, I was going to put there.

9924
08:19:15,180 --> 08:19:19,180
Wait, why can I not put here?

9925
08:19:19,180 --> 08:19:22,180
He puts here, I put there.

9926
08:19:22,180 --> 08:19:25,180
No, I put there, he puts there.

9927
08:19:25,180 --> 08:19:27,180
I win.

9928
08:19:28,180 --> 08:19:30,180
But why would you do that?

9929
08:19:30,180 --> 08:19:34,180
One, two, one, two, three, he wins.

9930
08:19:34,180 --> 08:19:36,180
Reh.

9931
08:19:39,180 --> 08:19:42,180
You could have had it, spare.

9932
08:19:46,180 --> 08:19:47,180
Here?

9933
08:19:48,180 --> 08:19:50,180
Oh wait, oh no!

9934
08:19:51,180 --> 08:19:56,180
Oh no, I did, I remembered like literally as I put that down.

9935
08:19:56,180 --> 08:19:58,180
Oh my god.

9936
08:19:58,180 --> 08:20:02,180
Bruv, I literally just threw that game, I could have won that.

9937
08:20:02,180 --> 08:20:04,180
Bruv.

9938
08:20:04,180 --> 08:20:07,180
I could have won it, Grimble.

9939
08:20:12,180 --> 08:20:17,180
It is too hard, it's so freaking hard to win Grimble, thank you for the tip.

9940
08:20:17,180 --> 08:20:20,180
Literally Hypnosis is the only reason I can get away with it.

9941
08:20:20,180 --> 08:20:22,180
Have I played with D-Riefland?

9942
08:20:22,180 --> 08:20:24,180
I don't think so.

9943
08:20:24,180 --> 08:20:27,180
Go again, boom.

9944
08:20:27,180 --> 08:20:29,180
No, my turn.

9945
08:20:31,180 --> 08:20:34,180
A well deserved loss.

9946
08:20:34,180 --> 08:20:38,180
Okay, look, I have room temperature IQ, I'm trying my best.

9947
08:20:42,180 --> 08:20:45,180
Right, no, don't do that.

9948
08:20:48,180 --> 08:20:50,180
Mmm.

9949
08:20:58,180 --> 08:21:02,180
But, I think you've played them all at least once now.

9950
08:21:02,180 --> 08:21:04,180
Yeah, go away.

9951
08:21:05,180 --> 08:21:09,180
Our darling low IQ Veeche bar, honestly.

9952
08:21:09,180 --> 08:21:13,180
More like our dangerously low IQ Veeche bar.

9953
08:21:14,180 --> 08:21:16,180
Hmm.

9954
08:21:16,180 --> 08:21:19,180
Oh my god, this is like a wish.

9955
08:21:24,180 --> 08:21:27,180
Yeah, I fucking love pepper.

9956
08:21:27,180 --> 08:21:30,180
You know what, chicken is the MVP, I'm not even playing.

9957
08:21:30,180 --> 08:21:35,180
Oh no, that is a good one, two, three, four.

9958
08:21:35,180 --> 08:21:38,180
What if I go here then?

9959
08:21:43,180 --> 08:21:46,180
I don't know what happened if I do for them.

9960
08:21:48,180 --> 08:21:52,180
Ah, I freaking love chicken sauce, it's like the best meat sauce ever.

9961
08:21:55,180 --> 08:21:59,180
Girls are cute when they're almost reeflings.

9962
08:21:59,180 --> 08:22:01,180
Wait, is that my turn?

9963
08:22:01,180 --> 08:22:03,180
What did you do?

9964
08:22:03,180 --> 08:22:05,180
What did you do?

9965
08:22:05,180 --> 08:22:07,180
Thank you for the game, strong.

9966
08:22:07,180 --> 08:22:09,180
Oh, you're welcome, you don't have to take me for that.

9967
08:22:09,180 --> 08:22:11,180
I have no idea what you did though.

9968
08:22:11,180 --> 08:22:13,180
Oh wait, this reeflings the end.

9969
08:22:13,180 --> 08:22:15,180
What did you do?

9970
08:22:15,180 --> 08:22:17,180
Is there something here?

9971
08:22:17,180 --> 08:22:19,180
I think I'm having something here.

9972
08:22:23,180 --> 08:22:25,180
Papago?

9973
08:22:29,180 --> 08:22:31,180
Alright, what happened if I go here?

9974
08:22:31,180 --> 08:22:33,180
I don't know, maybe I need to go down here?

9975
08:22:33,180 --> 08:22:35,180
Alright.

9976
08:22:40,180 --> 08:22:42,180
Here maybe?

9977
08:22:42,180 --> 08:22:44,180
I don't know.

9978
08:22:46,180 --> 08:22:48,180
If I go here then I'll lose, I hope not.

9979
08:22:52,180 --> 08:22:54,180
One, two, three, eh.

9980
08:22:54,180 --> 08:22:56,180
So eh.

9981
08:22:57,180 --> 08:22:59,180
Eh.

9982
08:23:00,180 --> 08:23:02,180
Ah, it's a fucking thing!

9983
08:23:03,180 --> 08:23:06,180
I have a fucking way to stay, it's so hard.

9984
08:23:07,180 --> 08:23:09,180
I don't even see it.

9985
08:23:10,180 --> 08:23:13,180
I literally can't even see it at all.

9986
08:23:15,180 --> 08:23:17,180
This is so hard though.

9987
08:23:17,180 --> 08:23:20,180
Is there any reeflings I haven't gone against?

9988
08:23:21,180 --> 08:23:23,180
I haven't gone against everyone here.

9989
08:23:27,180 --> 08:23:29,180
That's so hard.

9990
08:23:29,180 --> 08:23:31,180
Right, have I gone against everyone here?

9991
08:23:31,180 --> 08:23:33,180
I may have, you know that.

9992
08:23:35,180 --> 08:23:37,180
Are you a reefling? All fans?

9993
08:23:37,180 --> 08:23:39,180
All fans?

9994
08:23:40,180 --> 08:23:43,180
Maybe they're just confused why there's so many people here.

9995
08:23:44,180 --> 08:23:46,180
Does anyone want to go again?

9996
08:23:46,180 --> 08:23:48,180
Because I can play while I eat.

9997
08:23:50,180 --> 08:23:53,180
I think we're on run two, I think everyone's having a fair share.

9998
08:23:57,180 --> 08:23:59,180
Eh.

9999
08:23:59,180 --> 08:24:02,180
Look how all of you guys have numbers and stuff now,

10000
08:24:02,180 --> 08:24:04,180
because you've been beating me.

10001
08:24:04,180 --> 08:24:06,180
Hold on, eat, eat.

10002
08:24:06,180 --> 08:24:08,180
Um.

10003
08:24:09,180 --> 08:24:11,180
I'm eating my time.

10004
08:24:11,180 --> 08:24:14,180
I'll pass, I've been meant to do it in that one.

10005
08:24:15,180 --> 08:24:17,180
Mmm.

10006
08:24:18,180 --> 08:24:20,180
Yeah? Yeah.

10007
08:24:20,180 --> 08:24:23,180
That's the best counter in location I pay out.

10008
08:24:24,180 --> 08:24:26,180
Mmm.

10009
08:24:26,180 --> 08:24:28,180
You're shooting both of them.

10010
08:24:31,180 --> 08:24:33,180
The same thing is, you actually could have won three times

10011
08:24:33,180 --> 08:24:35,180
if you weren't placing tails randomly.

10012
08:24:36,180 --> 08:24:39,180
I'm trying to think ahead of my moves, okay?

10013
08:24:39,180 --> 08:24:41,180
It's hard.

10014
08:24:44,180 --> 08:24:46,180
Oh my god, this is delicious.

10015
08:24:48,180 --> 08:24:50,180
Reeflings, do you want me to baby barge you?

10016
08:24:50,180 --> 08:24:52,180
Because I'll do it.

10017
08:24:53,180 --> 08:24:55,180
Mmm.

10018
08:25:04,180 --> 08:25:07,180
Uh, don't like the look of that.

10019
08:25:07,180 --> 08:25:10,180
I'm getting nervous, I'm getting shaky.

10020
08:25:14,180 --> 08:25:16,180
I'm trying to do that then.

10021
08:25:16,180 --> 08:25:17,180
Get ready.

10022
08:25:17,180 --> 08:25:18,180
Oh no!

10023
08:25:18,180 --> 08:25:19,180
No!

10024
08:25:19,180 --> 08:25:21,180
No!

10025
08:25:22,180 --> 08:25:24,180
Why do I not see it?

10026
08:25:24,180 --> 08:25:26,180
Why do I not see it coming?

10027
08:25:27,180 --> 08:25:29,180
Why do I not see it coming?

10028
08:25:29,180 --> 08:25:31,180
I'm being so for real right now.

10029
08:25:31,180 --> 08:25:32,180
Right.

10030
08:25:32,180 --> 08:25:34,180
The next one I am not losing.

10031
08:25:34,180 --> 08:25:35,180
I don't care what happens.

10032
08:25:35,180 --> 08:25:37,180
I am not losing.

10033
08:25:38,180 --> 08:25:40,180
I am tryharding so much.

10034
08:25:41,180 --> 08:25:43,180
I am not losing this one.

10035
08:25:43,180 --> 08:25:45,180
I'm so serious.

10036
08:25:46,180 --> 08:25:48,180
Are we bimbo max?

10037
08:25:48,180 --> 08:25:49,180
I literally don't see it.

10038
08:25:49,180 --> 08:25:51,180
Right, you've placed it in the middle.

10039
08:25:51,180 --> 08:25:53,180
That's fine.

10040
08:25:53,180 --> 08:25:54,180
Is it?

10041
08:25:54,180 --> 08:25:55,180
I don't know.

10042
08:25:55,180 --> 08:25:57,180
We'll place it next to you then.

10043
08:25:59,180 --> 08:26:01,180
That's fine.

10044
08:26:01,180 --> 08:26:04,180
So I'll counter you from doing four in a row on the bottom.

10045
08:26:05,180 --> 08:26:07,180
And then I'll do this.

10046
08:26:09,180 --> 08:26:11,180
Alright.

10047
08:26:11,180 --> 08:26:13,180
One, two, three.

10048
08:26:13,180 --> 08:26:15,180
So you can't go anywhere there.

10049
08:26:15,180 --> 08:26:17,180
But I can progress by going here.

10050
08:26:20,180 --> 08:26:22,180
And that's fine.

10051
08:26:22,180 --> 08:26:24,180
You're allowed to do that.

10052
08:26:26,180 --> 08:26:28,180
Right.

10053
08:26:29,180 --> 08:26:31,180
Did I do it?

10054
08:26:32,180 --> 08:26:34,180
Oh, wait.

10055
08:26:35,180 --> 08:26:37,180
I thought I won there.

10056
08:26:37,180 --> 08:26:38,180
Wait.

10057
08:26:39,180 --> 08:26:41,180
Wait, why did I not win there?

10058
08:26:42,180 --> 08:26:44,180
Like this?

10059
08:26:44,180 --> 08:26:46,180
Did I counter them by going that way?

10060
08:26:49,180 --> 08:26:51,180
I will redeem myself.

10061
08:26:51,180 --> 08:26:53,180
Oh no, right.

10062
08:26:53,180 --> 08:26:55,180
One, two, three, four.

10063
08:26:55,180 --> 08:26:57,180
So drop it here.

10064
08:27:00,180 --> 08:27:02,180
I'm tryharding.

10065
08:27:02,180 --> 08:27:04,180
I'm looking.

10066
08:27:07,180 --> 08:27:09,180
Alright, if you're there,

10067
08:27:09,180 --> 08:27:11,180
one, two, three, four.

10068
08:27:11,180 --> 08:27:13,180
Fuck you.

10069
08:27:13,180 --> 08:27:15,180
Wait.

10070
08:27:16,180 --> 08:27:18,180
One, two, three, four.

10071
08:27:21,180 --> 08:27:23,180
What are you trying to do?

10072
08:27:23,180 --> 08:27:25,180
One, two, three, here.

10073
08:27:25,180 --> 08:27:27,180
So I can't put it in this column.

10074
08:27:30,180 --> 08:27:32,180
Right, you've put it up there,

10075
08:27:32,180 --> 08:27:34,180
which is fine.

10076
08:27:34,180 --> 08:27:36,180
Oh, fuck you.

10077
08:27:36,180 --> 08:27:38,180
You've blocked me.

10078
08:27:38,180 --> 08:27:40,180
Uh.

10079
08:27:40,180 --> 08:27:42,180
Wait.

10080
08:27:43,180 --> 08:27:45,180
So what happens now?

10081
08:27:46,180 --> 08:27:47,180
What did that do?

10082
08:27:47,180 --> 08:27:48,180
No, you're getting blocked.

10083
08:27:48,180 --> 08:27:49,180
I don't know what you're doing,

10084
08:27:49,180 --> 08:27:51,180
but don't do it.

10085
08:27:53,180 --> 08:27:54,180
I don't know what you're doing there,

10086
08:27:54,180 --> 08:27:56,180
but don't do it.

10087
08:27:58,180 --> 08:28:00,180
What are you doing over here now?

10088
08:28:03,180 --> 08:28:05,180
That's fine.

10089
08:28:07,180 --> 08:28:09,180
Whoa!

10090
08:28:09,180 --> 08:28:11,180
Whoa!

10091
08:28:11,180 --> 08:28:12,180
Get wrecked.

10092
08:28:12,180 --> 08:28:13,180
Get wrecked.

10093
08:28:13,180 --> 08:28:15,180
Get absolutely wrecked.

10094
08:28:15,180 --> 08:28:16,180
Oh my God, I did it.

10095
08:28:16,180 --> 08:28:18,180
I was like trying so hard.

10096
08:28:18,180 --> 08:28:20,180
I was trying to see what you were trying to do.

10097
08:28:20,180 --> 08:28:22,180
I was playing two characters at once on the board.

10098
08:28:22,180 --> 08:28:24,180
Oh, we did it.

10099
08:28:25,180 --> 08:28:27,180
I have lower connect for IQ.

10100
08:28:29,180 --> 08:28:31,180
Okay, let's try again.

10101
08:28:31,180 --> 08:28:33,180
Hold on, let me take a bite of my food.

10102
08:28:33,180 --> 08:28:35,180
Oh my God, I had to try so hard for that.

10103
08:28:36,180 --> 08:28:38,180
Mmm.

10104
08:28:39,180 --> 08:28:41,180
Okay.

10105
08:28:43,180 --> 08:28:45,180
Oh my God, that was so hard.

10106
08:28:46,180 --> 08:28:48,180
I don't know how people play logic games all the time.

10107
08:28:48,180 --> 08:28:50,180
I feel like my brain just gets so tired.

10108
08:28:50,180 --> 08:28:52,180
I'm like, oh, I'm done.

10109
08:28:52,180 --> 08:28:54,180
Mmm.

10110
08:28:56,180 --> 08:28:58,180
Mmm-hmm.

10111
08:29:00,180 --> 08:29:02,180
Mmm-hmm.

10112
08:29:03,180 --> 08:29:04,180
Here, here, here.

10113
08:29:04,180 --> 08:29:06,180
Oh, shit.

10114
08:29:06,180 --> 08:29:08,180
Oh, this is not looking good.

10115
08:29:10,180 --> 08:29:12,180
Mmm-hmm.

10116
08:29:15,180 --> 08:29:16,180
Am I going to throw?

10117
08:29:16,180 --> 08:29:18,180
I don't know what you're trying to do.

10118
08:29:19,180 --> 08:29:21,180
What are you trying to do?

10119
08:29:23,180 --> 08:29:24,180
Don't feel bad.

10120
08:29:24,180 --> 08:29:26,180
My brain is still at nice capacity.

10121
08:29:26,180 --> 08:29:27,180
Oh, no, what did you do?

10122
08:29:27,180 --> 08:29:28,180
I wasn't paying attention.

10123
08:29:28,180 --> 08:29:29,180
Right, you get blocked.

10124
08:29:36,180 --> 08:29:37,180
Mmm-hmm.

10125
08:29:38,180 --> 08:29:39,180
Oh, fuck!

10126
08:29:39,180 --> 08:29:42,180
Oh, for fuck's sake, it seems so hard.

10127
08:29:43,180 --> 08:29:47,180
Bro, when you go back to cooking swordfish, this is so hard.

10128
08:29:47,180 --> 08:29:48,180
How?

10129
08:29:49,180 --> 08:29:50,180
I never see it.

10130
08:29:50,180 --> 08:29:53,180
I, like, physically can't see it coming.

10131
08:29:54,180 --> 08:29:55,180
Until I hear the...

10132
08:29:59,180 --> 08:30:00,180
Bro.

10133
08:30:00,180 --> 08:30:02,180
Girlfriend is pouty and frustrated and upset.

10134
08:30:02,180 --> 08:30:04,180
She's got destroyed and fucking...

10135
08:30:04,180 --> 08:30:06,180
Not even just destroyed and runescaped.

10136
08:30:06,180 --> 08:30:09,180
Destroyed and runescaped, like, side player gate.

10137
08:30:09,180 --> 08:30:11,180
Oh, God, I'm first. Sorry.

10138
08:30:12,180 --> 08:30:14,180
Wait, how did that double down there?

10139
08:30:14,180 --> 08:30:15,180
I didn't even need to...

10140
08:30:15,180 --> 08:30:16,180
Oh, fine, I'm tripling down.

10141
08:30:22,180 --> 08:30:23,180
Mmm-hmm.

10142
08:30:29,180 --> 08:30:32,180
Oh, so I'm choking on my burrito in anger.

10143
08:30:34,180 --> 08:30:36,180
Because I'm so bad at this game.

10144
08:30:36,180 --> 08:30:37,180
Mmm-hmm.

10145
08:30:39,180 --> 08:30:40,180
I don't know.

10146
08:30:43,180 --> 08:30:46,180
No, you're gonna win!

10147
08:30:47,180 --> 08:30:49,180
Oh, look how freaking low my score is!

10148
08:30:49,180 --> 08:30:50,180
I started on a third.

10149
08:30:50,180 --> 08:30:52,180
Oh, my God, you're so good at winning.

10150
08:30:52,180 --> 08:30:53,180
What are you doing?

10151
08:30:54,180 --> 08:30:56,180
One, two, three, two, two.

10152
08:30:57,180 --> 08:30:59,180
I don't know what I'm doing, either, to be honest.

10153
08:31:01,180 --> 08:31:02,180
Ah, Saishayuma.

10154
08:31:03,180 --> 08:31:05,180
Ah, Saishayuma.

10155
08:31:12,180 --> 08:31:14,180
Ow, what are you doing?

10156
08:31:15,180 --> 08:31:16,180
Stop.

10157
08:31:17,180 --> 08:31:18,180
You're stressing me out.

10158
08:31:18,180 --> 08:31:19,180
This refland's gonna win.

10159
08:31:19,180 --> 08:31:21,180
They're, like, genuinely stressing me out.

10160
08:31:22,180 --> 08:31:23,180
Right, get blocked.

10161
08:31:25,180 --> 08:31:27,180
No! Oh, my God!

10162
08:31:27,180 --> 08:31:28,180
I hate...

10163
08:31:28,180 --> 08:31:29,180
Wait, we're going...

10164
08:31:29,180 --> 08:31:30,180
No, I'm sorry.

10165
08:31:30,180 --> 08:31:31,180
We're going back to Edgeville.

10166
08:31:31,180 --> 08:31:32,180
I'm actually fucking done.

10167
08:31:32,180 --> 08:31:33,180
I'm actually...

10168
08:31:33,180 --> 08:31:34,180
I'm done.

10169
08:31:34,180 --> 08:31:36,180
We're going back to Edgeville.

10170
08:31:36,180 --> 08:31:37,180
I'm not even kidding.

10171
08:31:37,180 --> 08:31:38,180
I'm not even joking.

10172
08:31:38,180 --> 08:31:39,180
We're going back to Edgeville.

10173
08:31:39,180 --> 08:31:40,180
I'm so done.

10174
08:31:40,180 --> 08:31:41,180
I'm so done.

10175
08:31:43,180 --> 08:31:45,180
We're going back to Edgeville to cook

10176
08:31:45,180 --> 08:31:46,180
freaking swordfish.

10177
08:31:46,180 --> 08:31:48,180
This is so hard.

10178
08:31:49,180 --> 08:31:50,180
This is so hard.

10179
08:31:50,180 --> 08:31:52,180
It's a surprise exam.

10180
08:31:52,180 --> 08:31:53,180
Get to fuck.

10181
08:31:53,180 --> 08:31:55,180
I've got the lowest IQ in the...

10182
08:31:56,180 --> 08:31:58,180
Freaking lower than room temperature water.

10183
08:31:58,180 --> 08:31:59,180
Oh, my God.

10184
08:32:01,180 --> 08:32:03,180
Why is that game so hard?

10185
08:32:04,180 --> 08:32:05,180
Freaking...

10186
08:32:06,180 --> 08:32:08,180
To no one's surprise,

10187
08:32:08,180 --> 08:32:10,180
the 1v1 chess stream has been delayed

10188
08:32:10,180 --> 08:32:12,180
due to the fact that I'm probably

10189
08:32:12,180 --> 08:32:14,180
gonna have to actually watch some chess tutorials

10190
08:32:14,180 --> 08:32:16,180
because I don't know how the rules work.

10191
08:32:18,180 --> 08:32:20,180
If she starts speaking...

10192
08:32:20,180 --> 08:32:21,180
If she starts speaking German,

10193
08:32:21,180 --> 08:32:22,180
she should really stop playing.

10194
08:32:22,180 --> 08:32:23,180
I respect your dedication

10195
08:32:23,180 --> 08:32:25,180
not to apply mind bullets to them

10196
08:32:25,180 --> 08:32:27,180
to gain a victory.

10197
08:32:27,180 --> 08:32:28,180
Is that what it should have done?

10198
08:32:28,180 --> 08:32:29,180
I should have done.

10199
08:32:29,180 --> 08:32:31,180
I should just start taking the bikini off

10200
08:32:31,180 --> 08:32:32,180
and all that.

10201
08:32:33,180 --> 08:32:35,180
I was so hard for no reason.

10202
08:32:36,180 --> 08:32:37,180
Take the random event.

10203
08:32:37,180 --> 08:32:38,180
Oh, is it good?

10204
08:32:38,180 --> 08:32:39,180
Sorry.

10205
08:32:41,180 --> 08:32:42,180
Hello.

10206
08:32:42,180 --> 08:32:43,180
Yeah, sure.

10207
08:32:43,180 --> 08:32:44,180
I'll find soon an exam.

10208
08:32:44,180 --> 08:32:45,180
Right.

10209
08:32:45,180 --> 08:32:46,180
What's my...

10210
08:32:46,180 --> 08:32:47,180
What is this?

10211
08:32:47,180 --> 08:32:48,180
Ah, it's your skullfish.

10212
08:32:48,180 --> 08:32:49,180
You've been slacking in your studies.

10213
08:32:49,180 --> 08:32:50,180
It's time for an exam.

10214
08:32:50,180 --> 08:32:51,180
In some case, Johnny,

10215
08:32:51,180 --> 08:32:53,180
once gay players are built different.

10216
08:32:53,180 --> 08:32:54,180
Bro, they are.

10217
08:32:54,180 --> 08:32:55,180
Thank you for the tip, boy.

10218
08:32:55,180 --> 08:32:57,180
They literally are, though.

10219
08:32:58,180 --> 08:32:59,180
There are two types of questions.

10220
08:32:59,180 --> 08:33:01,180
One requires you to find the next object

10221
08:33:01,180 --> 08:33:02,180
in a pattern.

10222
08:33:02,180 --> 08:33:03,180
And the second,

10223
08:33:03,180 --> 08:33:05,180
I will present you with 15 cards and a hint.

10224
08:33:06,180 --> 08:33:07,180
That's so specific.

10225
08:33:07,180 --> 08:33:08,180
What are we doing?

10226
08:33:08,180 --> 08:33:09,180
What comes next?

10227
08:33:09,180 --> 08:33:11,180
Shoes, shoes, shoes.

10228
08:33:11,180 --> 08:33:12,180
Shoes.

10229
08:33:12,180 --> 08:33:13,180
That's correct.

10230
08:33:13,180 --> 08:33:14,180
Next question.

10231
08:33:14,180 --> 08:33:16,180
Pick the object that should come next to a pattern.

10232
08:33:18,180 --> 08:33:19,180
A banana,

10233
08:33:19,180 --> 08:33:20,180
a dookie,

10234
08:33:20,180 --> 08:33:21,180
a pineapple,

10235
08:33:21,180 --> 08:33:23,180
a slice of watermelon.

10236
08:33:24,180 --> 08:33:25,180
Finally,

10237
08:33:25,180 --> 08:33:27,180
a apple that uses her brains.

10238
08:33:27,180 --> 08:33:28,180
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

10239
08:33:28,180 --> 08:33:29,180
Sure, sure.

10240
08:33:30,180 --> 08:33:32,180
These are gardening tools,

10241
08:33:32,180 --> 08:33:33,180
so we need a rake.

10242
08:33:34,180 --> 08:33:35,180
To the exit.

10243
08:33:35,180 --> 08:33:36,180
Okay, we did it.

10244
08:33:36,180 --> 08:33:37,180
We did it.

10245
08:33:37,180 --> 08:33:38,180
Please don't fail.

10246
08:33:38,180 --> 08:33:39,180
Imagine if I did this.

10247
08:33:43,180 --> 08:33:44,180
Oh, my God.

10248
08:33:44,180 --> 08:33:45,180
Did you hear that?

10249
08:33:45,180 --> 08:33:47,180
The burrito just kissed me

10250
08:33:47,180 --> 08:33:48,180
from the way I bit it.

10251
08:33:48,180 --> 08:33:50,180
What's the book of knowledge to do?

10252
08:33:50,180 --> 08:33:51,180
Ah!

10253
08:33:51,180 --> 08:33:52,180
Fishing?

10254
08:33:52,180 --> 08:33:53,180
It took him.

10255
08:33:56,180 --> 08:33:57,180
Wait.

10256
08:33:57,180 --> 08:33:59,180
Oh, that wasn't cooking.

10257
08:33:59,180 --> 08:34:00,180
Oh, my God.

10258
08:34:02,180 --> 08:34:03,180
Oh, my God.

10259
08:34:04,180 --> 08:34:06,180
Just when you think I couldn't get dumber,

10260
08:34:06,180 --> 08:34:09,180
I just put XP into firemaking

10261
08:34:09,180 --> 08:34:11,180
instead of cooking.

10262
08:34:11,180 --> 08:34:12,180
Bruv.

10263
08:34:12,180 --> 08:34:14,180
Can this get any worse?

10264
08:34:15,180 --> 08:34:17,180
I don't think it's any more obvious

10265
08:34:17,180 --> 08:34:18,180
how low my IQ is.

10266
08:34:18,180 --> 08:34:19,180
Holy crap.

10267
08:34:19,180 --> 08:34:20,180
It's even a miracle I can breathe

10268
08:34:20,180 --> 08:34:22,180
and eat at the same time.

10269
08:34:23,180 --> 08:34:26,180
Oh, my God.

10270
08:34:26,180 --> 08:34:27,180
Reefling's about to get jealous

10271
08:34:27,180 --> 08:34:29,180
over a burrito for real, for real.

10272
08:34:29,180 --> 08:34:30,180
Did you not hear?

10273
08:34:30,180 --> 08:34:31,180
Did it come up in the make?

10274
08:34:31,180 --> 08:34:32,180
It literally went...

10275
08:34:33,180 --> 08:34:35,180
when I bit into the burrito.

10276
08:34:37,180 --> 08:34:38,180
It's fine, you're a fish.

10277
08:34:38,180 --> 08:34:40,180
You are the goofiest of goobers.

10278
08:34:40,180 --> 08:34:41,180
We love you immensely.

10279
08:34:41,180 --> 08:34:44,180
The firemaking will warm up your IQ.

10280
08:34:45,180 --> 08:34:47,180
Small brain after all.

10281
08:34:47,180 --> 08:34:49,180
That was so hard.

10282
08:34:49,180 --> 08:34:50,180
I don't know how to play this.

10283
08:34:50,180 --> 08:34:51,180
Ah, jealous of a piece of fish.

10284
08:34:53,180 --> 08:34:55,180
Shawnee out here looking like process.

10285
08:34:55,180 --> 08:34:56,180
Bruv.

10286
08:34:56,180 --> 08:34:58,180
That was terrible.

10287
08:34:58,180 --> 08:35:00,180
I literally rage quit.

10288
08:35:00,180 --> 08:35:02,180
I'm like, no, I need to walk away.

10289
08:35:02,180 --> 08:35:03,180
Thank you very much, Reefling,

10290
08:35:03,180 --> 08:35:05,180
for making the fire.

10291
08:35:05,180 --> 08:35:07,180
Any arsonists?

10292
08:35:07,180 --> 08:35:09,180
Absolutely.

10293
08:35:09,180 --> 08:35:10,180
Let me keep eating this burrito

10294
08:35:10,180 --> 08:35:11,180
before it gets cold.

10295
08:35:16,180 --> 08:35:18,180
Are you squidding me right now?

10296
08:35:19,180 --> 08:35:21,180
Strowme, we're hungry.

10297
08:35:21,180 --> 08:35:23,180
Can you get back in the kitchen?

10298
08:35:23,180 --> 08:35:25,180
I mean, level in cooking.

10299
08:35:25,180 --> 08:35:27,180
Love you, you goofball.

10300
08:35:27,180 --> 08:35:29,180
Thank you, anonymous.

10301
08:35:29,180 --> 08:35:30,180
Love you too, little Reefling.

10302
08:35:30,180 --> 08:35:32,180
Yes, I will feed you well and good.

10303
08:35:33,180 --> 08:35:34,180
That was...

10304
08:35:34,180 --> 08:35:35,180
Thank you for the tip.

10305
08:35:35,180 --> 08:35:37,180
Oh my god, my hand's covered in sauce.

10306
08:35:42,180 --> 08:35:43,180
See, I'm not afraid to, like,

10307
08:35:43,180 --> 08:35:45,180
sauce off after Reefling.

10308
08:35:45,180 --> 08:35:47,180
As I choke on a piece of corn,

10309
08:35:47,180 --> 08:35:49,180
I can't talk and frickin...

10310
08:35:50,180 --> 08:35:52,180
...eat at the same time.

10311
08:35:58,180 --> 08:36:00,180
Oh my god.

10312
08:36:01,180 --> 08:36:03,180
That was so hard for no reason.

10313
08:36:03,180 --> 08:36:04,180
I've never played Connect 4 like that

10314
08:36:04,180 --> 08:36:06,180
in a very long time.

10315
08:36:06,180 --> 08:36:08,180
Bruv, I suck at anything logic-based.

10316
08:36:10,180 --> 08:36:12,180
Oh my god.

10317
08:36:13,180 --> 08:36:15,180
Is there Connect 4 championships?

10318
08:36:16,180 --> 08:36:18,180
Could you imagine?

10319
08:36:18,180 --> 08:36:20,180
You know how you get a rank in chess?

10320
08:36:22,180 --> 08:36:23,180
Can you imagine?

10321
08:36:23,180 --> 08:36:25,180
It was fun content, though.

10322
08:36:25,180 --> 08:36:27,180
Strowme gets absolutely destroyed by...

10323
08:36:30,180 --> 08:36:32,180
...viewers live on stream.

10324
08:36:32,180 --> 08:36:34,180
Rage quiz.

10325
08:36:35,180 --> 08:36:36,180
Mm-hmm.

10326
08:36:42,180 --> 08:36:43,180
Wow.

10327
08:36:44,180 --> 08:36:46,180
I almost finished this brutal.

10328
08:36:46,180 --> 08:36:47,180
My hand is covered.

10329
08:36:47,180 --> 08:36:49,180
I don't think I have a napkin.

10330
08:36:50,180 --> 08:36:52,180
Reeflings, do you want to come lick my fingers

10331
08:36:52,180 --> 08:36:54,180
and call me KFC?

10332
08:36:55,180 --> 08:36:57,180
Cause I'm finger-licking good.

10333
08:36:57,180 --> 08:36:58,180
Oh, hold on.

10334
08:36:58,180 --> 08:37:00,180
Cause I'm finger-licking good!

10335
08:37:02,180 --> 08:37:03,180
Thank you.

10336
08:37:09,180 --> 08:37:12,180
I have to lean over with my other hand to do that.

10337
08:37:13,180 --> 08:37:15,180
It's like a call offering.

10338
08:37:17,180 --> 08:37:20,180
I want KFC not to imagine that almost.

10339
08:37:23,180 --> 08:37:25,180
Cuttlefish pounded from four angles.

10340
08:37:25,180 --> 08:37:27,180
Yeah, that could be the title of the stream

10341
08:37:27,180 --> 08:37:29,180
cause I played that frickin...

10342
08:37:31,180 --> 08:37:33,180
Connect 4 more like...

10343
08:37:33,180 --> 08:37:35,180
Connect my shite.

10344
08:37:43,180 --> 08:37:45,180
Right, we'll finish the...

10345
08:37:46,180 --> 08:37:47,180
We'll finish eating.

10346
08:37:47,180 --> 08:37:49,180
And we'll finish the swordfish.

10347
08:37:51,180 --> 08:37:54,180
Snippets, 20-minute warning for Mercy.

10348
08:37:56,180 --> 08:37:58,180
Azura, I think, is still going to be live on stream.

10349
08:37:58,180 --> 08:38:00,180
Cause stream is a six-hour game.

10350
08:38:06,180 --> 08:38:07,180
If you're going to do emotes,

10351
08:38:07,180 --> 08:38:09,180
you should do questionable ones like this.

10352
08:38:09,180 --> 08:38:11,180
Is that questionable?

10353
08:38:11,180 --> 08:38:13,180
Oh, maybe if you're like under the table.

10354
08:38:13,180 --> 08:38:15,180
Then, yeah.

10355
08:38:16,180 --> 08:38:18,180
Yeah, Azura is still live.

10356
08:38:18,180 --> 08:38:19,180
Okay, that's good.

10357
08:38:21,180 --> 08:38:22,180
I'm eating.

10358
08:38:25,180 --> 08:38:27,180
Architect bros winning.

10359
08:38:31,180 --> 08:38:33,180
And do you want to know the calorie count

10360
08:38:33,180 --> 08:38:35,180
of my meal, Architect bros?

10361
08:38:38,180 --> 08:38:40,180
Just the thought of my stomach expanding

10362
08:38:40,180 --> 08:38:42,180
with all that food and sticking out,

10363
08:38:42,180 --> 08:38:44,180
going from a flat stomach

10364
08:38:44,180 --> 08:38:46,180
to all big and engorged...

10365
08:38:47,180 --> 08:38:48,180
Architect.

10366
08:38:51,180 --> 08:38:52,180
I'm sorry.

10367
08:38:53,180 --> 08:38:55,180
I don't know why I'm just talking about that.

10368
08:38:56,180 --> 08:38:58,180
No, Architect bros.

10369
08:38:59,180 --> 08:39:01,180
I hate it now, I'm teasing you.

10370
08:39:01,180 --> 08:39:03,180
I'm teasing your pickles.

10371
08:39:08,180 --> 08:39:09,180
I do not judge.

10372
08:39:11,180 --> 08:39:13,180
Don't be sorry, we enjoy it.

10373
08:39:13,180 --> 08:39:14,180
I should get a hydration.

10374
08:39:14,180 --> 08:39:16,180
Well, I'll say hydration as if it's not cool over.

10375
08:39:24,180 --> 08:39:25,180
Big burp.

10376
08:39:26,180 --> 08:39:27,180
Maybe a big burp.

10377
08:39:28,180 --> 08:39:29,180
We burp, we burp.

10378
08:39:29,180 --> 08:39:30,180
Not much force.

10379
08:39:30,180 --> 08:39:31,180
Not much fist room.

10380
08:39:31,180 --> 08:39:32,180
Dah, behind that burp.

10381
08:39:34,180 --> 08:39:35,180
Pause.

10382
08:39:36,180 --> 08:39:38,180
Yeah, we're now munching on the leftover chips

10383
08:39:38,180 --> 08:39:39,180
because I finished my burrito.

10384
08:39:39,180 --> 08:39:41,180
Some of the filling of the burrito spilled out,

10385
08:39:41,180 --> 08:39:42,180
so I'm like...

10386
08:39:42,180 --> 08:39:44,180
I'm using my chip as a vessel

10387
08:39:44,180 --> 08:39:46,180
to spoon it into my mouth.

10388
08:39:47,180 --> 08:39:49,180
Not the in-game rate in a mubbock.

10389
08:39:55,180 --> 08:39:57,180
Strawny feeds everyone equally.

10390
08:39:57,180 --> 08:39:59,180
That's why she's queen for it.

10391
08:40:02,180 --> 08:40:04,180
Your interests are my fascination.

10392
08:40:04,180 --> 08:40:06,180
Your curiosities are my challenge.

10393
08:40:07,180 --> 08:40:09,180
Chicken or beef?

10394
08:40:11,180 --> 08:40:12,180
Chicken.

10395
08:40:14,180 --> 08:40:16,180
I struggle to eat a lot around me

10396
08:40:16,180 --> 08:40:18,180
and then I wonder why I'm so ill.

10397
08:40:19,180 --> 08:40:21,180
It's literally got all the iron in it that I need.

10398
08:40:24,180 --> 08:40:26,180
I'm always a chicken boy.

10399
08:40:26,180 --> 08:40:28,180
I'm a chicken boy mubbock.

10400
08:40:31,180 --> 08:40:33,180
Do you know some Gomez person?

10401
08:40:33,180 --> 08:40:34,180
No, sorry.

10402
08:40:38,180 --> 08:40:39,180
Am I supposed to?

10403
08:40:41,180 --> 08:40:42,180
I love vision.

10404
08:40:42,180 --> 08:40:44,180
I think I've ever had vision before.

10405
08:40:45,180 --> 08:40:46,180
I'm heading to sleep at 6am.

10406
08:40:46,180 --> 08:40:47,180
Oh my goodness.

10407
08:40:47,180 --> 08:40:48,180
Please rest well.

10408
08:40:48,180 --> 08:40:50,180
Is that 6am America?

10409
08:40:50,180 --> 08:40:51,180
Must be.

10410
08:40:53,180 --> 08:40:56,180
Because it's like midnight in the UK, roughly.

10411
08:41:00,180 --> 08:41:01,180
Are you good?

10412
08:41:01,180 --> 08:41:02,180
Oops.

10413
08:41:03,180 --> 08:41:04,180
Who goes there?

10414
08:41:04,180 --> 08:41:05,180
I identify yourself.

10415
08:41:06,180 --> 08:41:08,180
No, it's only 8pm on the west coast.

10416
08:41:08,180 --> 08:41:09,180
Oh!

10417
08:41:10,180 --> 08:41:11,180
Sorry, I can't stop burping.

10418
08:41:11,180 --> 08:41:12,180
Good night, EU.

10419
08:41:13,180 --> 08:41:15,180
Thank you for absolutely reckoning

10420
08:41:15,180 --> 08:41:17,180
decking me on Kinect 4.

10421
08:41:18,180 --> 08:41:19,180
I live in Turkey.

10422
08:41:19,180 --> 08:41:20,180
Oh, okay, okay, okay.

10423
08:41:21,180 --> 08:41:22,180
It's 6am.

10424
08:41:23,180 --> 08:41:25,180
It's 11pm for me and I'm Midwest.

10425
08:41:25,180 --> 08:41:26,180
Yee-haw!

10426
08:41:26,180 --> 08:41:28,180
Nah, it's 4am in the UK.

10427
08:41:33,180 --> 08:41:35,180
Sorry, I'm still really enjoying my food

10428
08:41:35,180 --> 08:41:37,180
so I apologise if I'm not talking too much.

10429
08:41:38,180 --> 08:41:40,180
I'm trying to eat as fast as I can.

10430
08:41:45,180 --> 08:41:46,180
I keep doing that.

10431
08:41:46,180 --> 08:41:48,180
I'm just going to click on the booth.

10432
08:41:50,180 --> 08:41:51,180
Let's go to the booth.

10433
08:41:53,180 --> 08:41:55,180
Am I dumb, but can I ask what munkah means?

10434
08:41:55,180 --> 08:41:56,180
Munkah.

10435
08:41:56,180 --> 08:41:59,180
Munkah S is a twitch emote

10436
08:41:59,180 --> 08:42:01,180
where Pappy looks really stressed out

10437
08:42:01,180 --> 08:42:04,180
and he's like, oh, like, like, nervous.

10438
08:42:04,180 --> 08:42:07,180
And I reduce it to munkah.

10439
08:42:07,180 --> 08:42:08,180
Munkah!

10440
08:42:10,180 --> 08:42:13,180
But if you type in munkah S on Google

10441
08:42:13,180 --> 08:42:15,180
it'll just show you what Pappy looks like.

10442
08:42:15,180 --> 08:42:16,180
He's all stressed out.

10443
08:42:19,180 --> 08:42:21,180
Almost 4am and I'm slowly losing it.

10444
08:42:21,180 --> 08:42:23,180
Please go to sleep!

10445
08:42:24,180 --> 08:42:25,180
Oh my god.

10446
08:42:26,180 --> 08:42:28,180
Please don't worry about going to sleep.

10447
08:42:28,180 --> 08:42:30,180
Like, seriously, I don't want you guys, like,

10448
08:42:30,180 --> 08:42:32,180
risking your health to watch me stream.

10449
08:42:32,180 --> 08:42:34,180
Like, I'm literally stuffing my face.

10450
08:42:34,180 --> 08:42:35,180
I just got wrecked and connect 4

10451
08:42:35,180 --> 08:42:37,180
and I'm going straight back to cooking.

10452
08:42:37,180 --> 08:42:39,180
Like, you ain't missing out on too much, I assure you.

10453
08:42:42,180 --> 08:42:44,180
Time for a hypnotic slumber.

10454
08:42:54,180 --> 08:42:56,180
Sleep is for the weakest weekend now.

10455
08:42:58,180 --> 08:43:00,180
Sleep equals exp wasted.

10456
08:43:02,180 --> 08:43:04,180
Oh my god, really, really close to level.

10457
08:43:04,180 --> 08:43:05,180
I'm not next batch.

10458
08:43:05,180 --> 08:43:07,180
I don't know what level.

10459
08:43:07,180 --> 08:43:08,180
40.

10460
08:43:08,180 --> 08:43:10,180
Eh, 74?

10461
08:43:18,180 --> 08:43:20,180
I hate arching on mobile.

10462
08:43:23,180 --> 08:43:26,180
See, we've got like a billion different things to click to do or anything.

10463
08:43:27,180 --> 08:43:28,180
And...

10464
08:43:29,180 --> 08:43:30,180
Ah!

10465
08:43:30,180 --> 08:43:31,180
76!

10466
08:43:31,180 --> 08:43:34,180
Oh my god, how much did Wine Boosters?

10467
08:43:35,180 --> 08:43:37,180
I thought we were selling like 72.

10468
08:43:41,180 --> 08:43:45,180
Wine is faster, but I want to use all the fish that the reeflings gave me.

10469
08:43:46,180 --> 08:43:48,180
Because I don't want it to go to waste.

10470
08:43:48,180 --> 08:43:51,180
I don't want it to be, like, rotting in my bank.

10471
08:43:56,180 --> 08:43:59,180
Four more levels and you can cook sharks.

10472
08:44:05,180 --> 08:44:07,180
I have a good night.

10473
08:44:07,180 --> 08:44:09,180
Please rest well.

10474
08:44:10,180 --> 08:44:13,180
Wine got me 72 at 65 in, like, under an hour.

10475
08:44:17,180 --> 08:44:19,180
Only power...

10476
08:44:20,180 --> 08:44:25,180
Only power to bring me back to this Godforsaken game is like cute fish!

10477
08:44:27,180 --> 08:44:30,180
It's a good game, but...

10478
08:44:30,180 --> 08:44:35,180
If you've got stuff to do, it's not the easiest game to, like, keep up the excitement.

10479
08:44:35,180 --> 08:44:40,180
I think RuneScape, I would say, is probably similar to, like, people say,

10480
08:44:40,180 --> 08:44:44,180
like, when you start up a Minecraft server, um...

10481
08:44:44,180 --> 08:44:50,180
Pardon me, and you play for, like, a week and then you all get burnt out and never go on it again type thing.

10482
08:44:50,180 --> 08:44:53,180
Wine got you from 69 to 70.

10483
08:44:53,180 --> 08:44:55,180
It feels good, man.

10484
08:44:57,180 --> 08:44:59,180
Nooo!

10485
08:44:59,180 --> 08:45:01,180
Not cooking and doing your species.

10486
08:45:01,180 --> 08:45:05,180
There's plenty to go around in the RuneScape economy.

10487
08:45:05,180 --> 08:45:08,180
More than enough, actually.

10488
08:45:08,180 --> 08:45:12,180
In fact, the waters are so infested with shark, they're everywhere.

10489
08:45:14,180 --> 08:45:15,180
Thank you.

10490
08:45:15,180 --> 08:45:17,180
Uh, boi- boi!

10491
08:45:18,180 --> 08:45:21,180
Can I say thank you and I'll miss for the other tips?

10492
08:45:22,180 --> 08:45:27,180
Love you, you're good for all. Love you too, love everything.

10493
08:45:27,180 --> 08:45:30,180
Or love you too, uh, Anonymous.

10494
08:45:30,180 --> 08:45:34,180
I don't know if I'm supposed to guess, I'm supposed to call you Anonymous or everything.

10495
08:45:39,180 --> 08:45:41,180
A rainbow fish!

10496
08:45:44,180 --> 08:45:45,180
Okay.

10497
08:45:45,180 --> 08:45:49,180
I've almost finished eating, I'm so sorry if it feels like I've been chewing for ages.

10498
08:45:49,180 --> 08:45:51,180
I was too busy getting- oh!

10499
08:45:51,180 --> 08:45:53,180
That's how many times have I done that now?

10500
08:45:53,180 --> 08:45:55,180
No, stop eating!

10501
08:45:55,180 --> 08:45:57,180
What are you doing?

10502
08:45:58,180 --> 08:46:00,180
Jeez, Louise woman.

10503
08:46:03,180 --> 08:46:04,180
Okay.

10504
08:46:04,180 --> 08:46:06,180
We've almost finished...

10505
08:46:06,180 --> 08:46:08,180
the...

10506
08:46:09,180 --> 08:46:11,180
the fishy.

10507
08:46:11,180 --> 08:46:14,180
Oh my god, sorry, I can't think I'm just too busy eating.

10508
08:46:14,180 --> 08:46:18,180
I've almost finished eating, I promise I'll finish eating soon.

10509
08:46:19,180 --> 08:46:21,180
How did you take so long to eat?

10510
08:46:24,180 --> 08:46:27,180
Walked into an eater's room, thank goodness I'm not late.

10511
08:46:27,180 --> 08:46:30,180
I'm gonna have her.

10512
08:46:31,180 --> 08:46:34,180
For the architect bros, this one's for you.

10513
08:46:34,180 --> 08:46:38,180
I order two meals because I have the second meal the next day,

10514
08:46:38,180 --> 08:46:42,180
so tomorrow I'll be eating my next meal.

10515
08:46:42,180 --> 08:46:45,180
So I'm gonna go put it in the fridge, in the-

10516
08:46:45,180 --> 08:46:48,180
and wash my hands because they're covered in grease.

10517
08:46:48,180 --> 08:46:50,180
They're covered.

10518
08:46:53,180 --> 08:46:55,180
She knows about that.

10519
08:46:55,180 --> 08:46:58,180
So, when Azura got released,

10520
08:46:58,180 --> 08:47:00,180
I read up a little bit and people were like,

10521
08:47:00,180 --> 08:47:02,180
oh my god, architect chocolate, and I'm like,

10522
08:47:02,180 --> 08:47:04,180
wait, I thought you were-

10523
08:47:04,180 --> 08:47:06,180
and I was like reading, I'm like,

10524
08:47:06,180 --> 08:47:08,180
oh okay, right, I get it now.

10525
08:47:08,180 --> 08:47:11,180
Why architect is such a random word for it though?

10526
08:47:13,180 --> 08:47:16,180
I still don't get the origin, but hey ho.

10527
08:47:16,180 --> 08:47:18,180
Anyway, I'm gonna very quickly wash my hands

10528
08:47:18,180 --> 08:47:21,180
because they're covered in freaking grease from the burrito.

10529
08:47:21,180 --> 08:47:24,180
That was absolutely inhaling and getting rolled on.

10530
08:47:24,180 --> 08:47:28,180
I'll be literally a millisecond, I don't need to do anything special.

10531
08:47:46,180 --> 08:47:48,180
...

10532
08:47:48,180 --> 08:47:50,180
...

10533
08:47:50,180 --> 08:47:52,180
...

10534
08:47:52,180 --> 08:47:54,180
...

10535
08:47:54,180 --> 08:47:56,180
...

10536
08:47:56,180 --> 08:47:58,180
...

10537
08:47:58,180 --> 08:48:00,180
...

10538
08:48:00,180 --> 08:48:02,180
...

10539
08:48:02,180 --> 08:48:04,180
...

10540
08:48:04,180 --> 08:48:06,180
...

10541
08:48:06,180 --> 08:48:08,180
...

10542
08:48:10,180 --> 08:48:12,180
...

10543
08:48:12,180 --> 08:48:14,180
...

10544
08:48:14,180 --> 08:48:16,180
...

10545
08:48:16,180 --> 08:48:18,180
...

10546
08:48:18,180 --> 08:48:20,180
...

10547
08:48:20,180 --> 08:48:22,180
...

10548
08:48:22,180 --> 08:48:24,180
...

10549
08:48:24,180 --> 08:48:26,180
...

10550
08:48:26,180 --> 08:48:28,180
...

10551
08:48:28,180 --> 08:48:30,180
...

10552
08:48:30,180 --> 08:48:32,180
...

10553
08:48:32,180 --> 08:48:34,180
...

10554
08:48:34,180 --> 08:48:36,180
...

10555
08:48:36,180 --> 08:48:38,180
...

10556
08:48:38,180 --> 08:48:40,180
...

10557
08:48:40,180 --> 08:48:42,180
I've just stood up and I'm aware of her fill my bladder

10558
08:48:42,180 --> 08:48:44,180
because I'm gonna go pee.

10559
08:48:44,180 --> 08:48:46,180
...

10560
08:48:46,180 --> 08:48:48,180
...

10561
08:48:48,180 --> 08:48:50,180
...

10562
08:48:50,180 --> 08:48:52,180
...

10563
08:48:52,180 --> 08:48:54,180
...

10564
08:48:54,180 --> 08:48:56,180
...

10565
08:48:56,180 --> 08:48:58,180
...

10566
08:48:58,180 --> 08:49:00,180
...

10567
08:49:00,180 --> 08:49:02,180
...

10568
08:49:02,180 --> 08:49:04,180
...

10569
08:49:04,180 --> 08:49:06,180
...

10570
08:49:06,180 --> 08:49:08,180
...

10571
08:49:08,180 --> 08:49:10,180
...

10572
08:49:10,180 --> 08:49:12,180
...

10573
08:49:12,180 --> 08:49:14,180
...

10574
08:49:14,180 --> 08:49:16,180
...

10575
08:49:16,180 --> 08:49:18,180
...

10576
08:49:18,180 --> 08:49:20,180
...

10577
08:49:20,180 --> 08:49:22,180
...

10578
08:49:22,180 --> 08:49:24,180
...

10579
08:49:24,180 --> 08:49:26,180
...

10580
08:49:26,180 --> 08:49:28,180
...

10581
08:49:28,180 --> 08:49:30,180
...

10582
08:49:30,180 --> 08:49:32,180
...

10583
08:49:32,180 --> 08:49:34,180
...

10584
08:49:34,180 --> 08:49:36,180
...

10585
08:49:36,180 --> 08:49:38,180
...

10586
08:50:08,180 --> 08:50:31,420
I have six set, where does my head start, I've lost it, okay, I've just sat down and

10587
08:50:31,420 --> 08:50:44,100
I need a two, damn you, I'm gonna do it, I'm gonna do it, I'm gonna sneeze actually, okay,

10588
08:50:44,100 --> 08:50:55,500
what a wake up, okay, you're done, am I getting sick, I better not be, I am not

10589
08:50:55,500 --> 08:51:00,100
getting sick when I've not even done a month full of streaming yet, I do not tell

10590
08:51:00,340 --> 08:51:08,780
tolerate any sickness, I haven't even done it a full month yet, I'm getting sick, damn you, the

10591
08:51:08,780 --> 08:51:24,900
taskmasker, for me, no not for me, for any, maybe better streaming hours would help you,

10592
08:51:25,420 --> 08:51:31,740
what, you mean don't do 12 hours naturally, what are you talking about refling, don't say

10593
08:51:31,740 --> 08:51:39,100
such nonsense, are you trying to upset me refling, you're trying to make me feel it's

10594
08:51:39,100 --> 08:51:47,300
because you left us, okay, I won't feel sick anymore, you're laughing but I have separation

10595
08:51:47,300 --> 08:51:57,100
anxiety with you guys, it's been getting better but I feel an immense amount of anxiety at the,

10596
08:51:57,100 --> 08:52:05,420
before I click go live and then it goes away when I am live, I'm not sure what that means,

10597
08:52:05,420 --> 08:52:14,420
I mean I had it last time, wink wink, and then it subsided and it was back again so I don't

10598
08:52:14,500 --> 08:52:19,700
have to plan as it's going to subside over my body so sooner, we love you too, hey,

10599
08:52:19,700 --> 08:52:25,540
scrawny, when are the Elden Ring Streams, when the DLC releases, you've been playing for a while,

10600
08:52:25,540 --> 08:52:33,620
consider taking a break, do you insult me Jagex, do you think me some prepubescent child that can't

10601
08:52:33,620 --> 08:52:44,140
handle a little gaming session, Jagex please do not dare interrupt my flow, do you ever

10602
08:52:44,340 --> 08:52:50,740
get anxiety when it comes to ending streams, I get nervous about ending the stream because

10603
08:52:50,740 --> 08:52:55,100
of what I'm going to say and I know that seems silly because it's like well you say the same

10604
08:52:55,100 --> 08:53:01,020
every time like I say like I'll see you tomorrow, like I love you reflings, a few kisses on that

10605
08:53:01,020 --> 08:53:07,140
but I get worried about it and I don't know why, I think it's because I am saying goodbye and it's

10606
08:53:07,140 --> 08:53:15,220
like I won't see you until the next time I'm up, you know, and too much of a grimoire you somehow

10607
08:53:15,220 --> 08:53:26,340
groomed yourself, hear a veal or you don't grimoire, what a slogan to have for a, every time I do

10608
08:53:26,340 --> 08:53:30,900
that, what a slogan to have for a visa reasons that, I can't believe I said that out loud with my

10609
08:53:30,980 --> 08:53:39,540
fulche, ain't that true though, yeah, oh when I was lurking someone mentioned that they didn't

10610
08:53:39,540 --> 08:53:44,500
realize we both have a nicotine patch on us because we're addicted to each other, it's not

10611
08:53:44,500 --> 08:53:49,460
for the reflings that are addicted to each other, no, refling and strongy aren't addicted to each

10612
08:53:49,460 --> 08:53:57,460
other, I can always ramble and procrastinate ending streaming calls, those are so awkward doing so,

10613
08:53:57,460 --> 08:54:04,100
mmm, well like when we reached the 10 hour board mark on that other stream, I can't even remember

10614
08:54:04,100 --> 08:54:10,580
what it was, the entire ending got caught but I was like trying to say so much all at once just

10615
08:54:10,580 --> 08:54:16,900
because like I wanted to, you know, and I wasn't expected to be groomed but I'm glad you did,

10616
08:54:16,900 --> 08:54:20,580
oh that sounds terrible when you write that out in a sentence, I'm gonna be honest, it makes me

10617
08:54:20,580 --> 08:54:32,580
sound like Chris Hansen, take a seat moment, yeah, kind of true though, I think pre-stream

10618
08:54:32,580 --> 08:54:38,820
anxiety is normal, you're talking to an auditorium worth of people, I actually don't get nervous to

10619
08:54:38,820 --> 08:54:48,900
stream in that sense, it doesn't, I don't look at the numbers like I don't actually know, it's not

10620
08:54:48,900 --> 08:54:57,060
like on display for me, it's just me and reflings playing multiplayer game and that's it, like that's

10621
08:54:57,060 --> 08:55:03,700
what it is, it's not like I'm nervous because I'm gonna have to go perform, I don't have any kind of

10622
08:55:03,700 --> 08:55:10,500
imposter syndrome, I don't have any kind of like I'm not good enough, I just like straight up have

10623
08:55:10,500 --> 08:55:20,980
separation anxiety and that's it pretty much, like I don't get nervous to stream, I don't get like oh

10624
08:55:20,980 --> 08:55:29,140
my god what happens if they don't like it, no, I'm just like just getting nervous, I'm like oh god

10625
08:55:29,140 --> 08:55:36,420
I don't feel well, like I feel sick, like my stomach feels ill sometimes, but like I've started

10626
08:55:36,420 --> 08:55:41,220
up streams and I've said to you like oh guys it's not gonna be like a long stream today and then it

10627
08:55:41,220 --> 08:55:47,060
ends up turning into like six hours type thing um when I only had the intention of two because I

10628
08:55:47,060 --> 08:55:51,780
wasn't feeling well, but as soon as I start streaming it's like I get a second burst of wind,

10629
08:55:52,420 --> 08:55:58,580
like I'm super energetic, I'm super engaging, like I'm having like so much fun, I'm enjoying myself

10630
08:55:58,580 --> 08:56:05,300
like right now we're looking at pixels over and over again putting, pardon me for being so rude,

10631
08:56:05,300 --> 08:56:10,340
it was not me, it was my food and like I'm having so much fun, like look at all the reeflings that

10632
08:56:10,340 --> 08:56:17,700
are in the bank with me right now, like all of us goofing off and like uh Mack, mackerel or maker,

10633
08:56:17,700 --> 08:56:29,940
Mack maker, thank you for coming to Memba, um it's just like, it's like me with social anxiety,

10634
08:56:29,940 --> 08:56:34,660
I don't want to go out but when I'm out it's fun, yeah it's kind of like getting over the hump

10635
08:56:34,660 --> 08:56:44,660
if you will and and like I especially enjoy my endurance streams, like I kind of spoke on it the

10636
08:56:44,660 --> 08:56:52,740
other day, um one time I was having a really bad time and reeflings were just hanging out with me

10637
08:56:52,740 --> 08:56:59,460
and this isn't now, this isn't now, this is like way in the past, um and we played a song and it's

10638
08:56:59,460 --> 08:57:05,860
called Mr Kitty, um and it's like a really depressive song or kind of slow tempo song

10639
08:57:06,980 --> 08:57:12,500
and I heard it and I was listening to it and it made me feel a certain way, it made me feel

10640
08:57:12,500 --> 08:57:17,940
quite negative, like it was quite a depressive song, Mr Kitty After Dark, yes that was the song

10641
08:57:18,820 --> 08:57:23,780
and I listened to it and I typed and I said is this what you guys feel like all the time?

10642
08:57:24,740 --> 08:57:30,500
because of the way the song had like resonated with me, it felt as rough as I had felt in that

10643
08:57:30,500 --> 08:57:34,340
moment because I was feeling rough because you know stuff was going on behind the scene, um

10644
08:57:36,020 --> 08:57:44,900
and it kind of like made me realize like if me hanging out, having a carry-on, rambling,

10645
08:57:44,900 --> 08:57:50,020
coming up with all these like silly little ASMR ideas and like all these collab ideas and elaborate

10646
08:57:50,020 --> 08:57:56,580
stuff and all of that and like it makes you not feel like that when I stream, like how blessed

10647
08:57:56,580 --> 08:58:06,260
and how lucky like we're on this timeline, like you know you can feel, I don't know, like accepted

10648
08:58:06,260 --> 08:58:12,020
to just like do your own thing, like I always say the phrase you can be at arm's length, you can be

10649
08:58:12,020 --> 08:58:16,980
attached at the hip, you can be on my head type thing, it's completely up to you Viflin, um

10650
08:58:17,940 --> 08:58:22,340
but I do remember that night because I was like you guys feel like that, like when

10651
08:58:23,380 --> 08:58:26,660
just in general like you have like such a rough time and then you come

10652
08:58:27,620 --> 08:58:33,860
on stream and like you come and you you make me laugh, you make me giggle, we tell terrible puns

10653
08:58:33,860 --> 08:58:40,900
while going like and we're just hanging out type thing, you know it's like even when like you feel

10654
08:58:40,900 --> 08:58:46,500
so rough you're so willing to like come to me, be so accepting of me, like say such nice things to me

10655
08:58:46,500 --> 08:58:54,260
and encourage me to do stuff and all of that and it's just like it's such like a nice way like

10656
08:58:54,260 --> 08:59:01,300
hopefully, I hope it's like a positive feedback loop where you make me giggle, I make you giggle

10657
08:59:01,300 --> 08:59:08,180
and like we just have a fun time for what it's worth and sometimes you need a song like that

10658
08:59:08,180 --> 08:59:13,380
to marinate in your thought, yeah like I don't listen to what I consider like sad music in the

10659
08:59:13,700 --> 08:59:22,100
dumps music or emotional music, like I listen to Atarashi Gako and like Tokyo Calling, Tokyo Calling

10660
08:59:22,100 --> 08:59:25,940
um like I listen to Hatsune Miku, I don't even know what's happening half the time when I listen

10661
08:59:25,940 --> 08:59:31,140
to Hatsune Miku but like the music's so upbeat, it's so up-pop, like I never listen to anything

10662
08:59:31,140 --> 08:59:38,100
depressive, like like goofy, like literally I'm listening to a Dutch song, I have no idea what's

10663
08:59:38,180 --> 08:59:45,940
being said, other than the lyrics suck ma, type thing, you know, I love that thing

10664
08:59:48,420 --> 08:59:54,500
thanks for the stream strong, I'm off to watch Mercy, yes any snippets, Mercy Modiste is live

10665
08:59:54,500 --> 09:00:00,980
and she is playing with my willy, she's not, maybe in another life

10666
09:00:01,700 --> 09:00:02,900
um

10667
09:00:06,580 --> 09:00:09,700
right hold on let me check, Hatsune Miku has become a legendary figure

10668
09:00:11,140 --> 09:00:17,540
of Mickey and homework, right hold on what is Mercy playing, is Azura still live, Azura is

10669
09:00:17,540 --> 09:00:27,060
still live, she's playing Shrey live, Mercy Modiste, Mercy is playing Harvester part two, I already

10670
09:00:27,060 --> 09:00:32,900
knew that because I said that earlier and yeah I forgot, see you brain, see you brain

10671
09:00:39,940 --> 09:00:48,340
I got a comment on the new the ASMR video and someone's like why is this being recommended to me

10672
09:00:48,900 --> 09:00:54,420
hey hey hey hey hey you can't resist the ASMR

10673
09:00:59,620 --> 09:01:03,140
the most I felt like that after dark was when that um

10674
09:01:05,060 --> 09:01:11,540
when you go in member to a members world, I don't know if we need to do a members world this stream

10675
09:01:11,540 --> 09:01:19,460
and maybe next stream we're doing members world unfortunately although wine isn't members is it

10676
09:01:20,580 --> 09:01:23,940
no maybe not, I don't know if we're just doing members all the way to the end

10677
09:01:25,460 --> 09:01:28,420
if we're doing wines all the way to the end, people say wines is faster

10678
09:01:29,860 --> 09:01:35,380
literally get algorithmed, honestly what did you miss I stuffed my face and then

10679
09:01:36,180 --> 09:01:43,220
uh let uh let the architect bros know I've got them in the back of my mind

10680
09:01:48,020 --> 09:01:51,220
um yeah hold on, hold on

10681
09:01:53,300 --> 09:01:57,140
the begging ASMR is peak ASMR honestly, wait what does it say now

10682
09:01:57,860 --> 09:02:06,420
uh it's still going, oh my god is that 23,000 views, that doesn't make sense

10683
09:02:07,940 --> 09:02:14,020
architect bros eating good just like strongy honestly what does it mean architect architect

10684
09:02:14,020 --> 09:02:24,180
is a terminology used for people who enjoy bigger body types or eating type of content

10685
09:02:25,140 --> 09:02:34,260
or gaining weight type of content but there's different levels to it um so Azura delays

10686
09:02:34,260 --> 09:02:39,780
body type because she's not like the default skinny malinky I keep opening this freaking

10687
09:02:39,780 --> 09:02:48,420
collection box um VTuber so she would get referred to as someone for the architect bros

10688
09:02:49,380 --> 09:02:54,500
look at all the swordfish they're so purple

10689
09:02:56,340 --> 09:02:57,380
they're so purple

10690
09:02:59,620 --> 09:03:05,220
uh architect bros specifically vtubers I think

10691
09:03:06,900 --> 09:03:14,500
she shuffled herself in the ink yes uh again Azura Duly is live with a stray

10692
09:03:15,460 --> 09:03:21,540
hopefully her pc doesn't explode um and merci mondice is playing harvester part two

10693
09:03:21,540 --> 09:03:27,060
which she never told me there was a part two because I'm getting a highlight reel of part one

10694
09:03:27,940 --> 09:03:31,700
which isn't going to make any sense if I don't get a highlight reel of part two

10695
09:03:35,700 --> 09:03:39,700
I love strongy I love reeflings what you're gonna do about it huh you're gonna kiss me on my

10696
09:03:39,940 --> 09:03:47,220
lips you know let me hold your hand actually I have something to ask the reeflings are

10697
09:03:48,100 --> 09:03:54,340
you guys are like small enough to fit in the palm of my hand basically do you guys like that

10698
09:03:54,340 --> 09:04:03,060
you're smaller than me or would you like a mascot that's like bigger oh my god why am I struggling

10699
09:04:03,140 --> 09:04:10,580
so hard with this bank system um like you're so nice and tame yeah smaller than you is better

10700
09:04:11,300 --> 09:04:17,780
what is my size um I don't even think I have a reference artwork I can use that isn't tall

10701
09:04:17,780 --> 09:04:25,300
spreading small is nice yes you're if you didn't know secret hidden lore for the reeflings your

10702
09:04:25,300 --> 09:04:29,780
tentacles can grow as long as you like so you can interact with things as much as you need

10703
09:04:30,420 --> 09:04:34,900
um you have very very long tentacles if you so desire but they're just nice and cute and

10704
09:04:34,900 --> 09:04:41,300
stacked together whilst you are in oh my god the crisscross salmon the salmon are going upstream

10705
09:04:41,300 --> 09:04:52,100
look they're going upstream what we are growers not sure it's exactly hmm almost like a previous

10706
09:04:52,180 --> 09:04:59,220
lore strange it small means when you cuddle as we feel you every yeah I can put you in my mouth

10707
09:04:59,220 --> 09:05:07,300
in my tummy we can go explore strony in the first thing

10708
09:05:08,900 --> 09:05:12,020
share a blindfold reeflings but let your tentacles do what they want

10709
09:05:14,500 --> 09:05:16,580
bank boost I'm not going to mess up this time

10710
09:05:22,500 --> 09:05:28,660
oh wow how do I do the fire huh okay there we go

10711
09:05:30,500 --> 09:05:37,460
strony subtly mentioned war oh I don't mind it no okay I like giant tests like war um

10712
09:05:40,580 --> 09:05:44,340
what else do I like um

10713
09:05:44,740 --> 09:05:50,580
I'm trying to think of other things that are considered like not regular

10714
09:05:53,700 --> 09:06:05,780
hmm spelunking me no I can't escape that word it's like mongolian frozing in it's everywhere

10715
09:06:05,780 --> 09:06:12,340
it's everywhere can't escape it no spelunking what does it even mean

10716
09:06:14,420 --> 09:06:20,340
you can't even tell me it's not related to the bedroom spelunking I can't wait to go spelunking

10717
09:06:20,340 --> 09:06:31,060
with the reeflings oh I can't wait until we go into a tight dark damp cave and spelunk together

10718
09:06:31,060 --> 09:06:35,140
like bro whoever named spelunking spelunking you knew exactly what you did

10719
09:06:35,140 --> 09:06:43,380
I mean cave exploring yeah literally spelunking

10720
09:06:44,420 --> 09:06:49,860
you've ever heard such a more ridiculous word how dare they make such a word

10721
09:06:51,300 --> 09:06:56,260
oh my god you're still doing absolutely wakey wakey sleepyhead

10724
09:07:11,460 --> 09:07:18,740

10725
09:07:18,740 --> 09:07:26,420
and then uh we'll redirect into a streamer I don't know who I don't even know who's not online

10726
09:07:26,420 --> 09:07:32,180
normally at this time but we will find a vtuber that is live that we can redirect into

10727
09:07:32,900 --> 09:07:39,300
the euro cup fit ball is on the new all right okay right good luck uh I am down for some spelunking

10728
09:07:39,300 --> 09:07:47,140
right now uh plunging is another fun one plunging please do not plunge me that's not abysmal

10729
09:07:49,700 --> 09:07:55,700
spelunking in the cave of a giant earth I don't know how to how far to go with the giant earth

10730
09:07:55,700 --> 09:08:00,500
and the zero I might not make her do the weird side of things I might do the weird side of things

10731
09:08:00,900 --> 09:08:04,820
but yeah

10732
09:08:10,020 --> 09:08:12,580
no plo no plunging not even a little

10733
09:08:14,420 --> 09:08:21,940
you can plug me up whoa wait hold on I was like so direct my brain was like oh this will this is

10734
09:08:21,940 --> 09:08:27,380
fine this is clearly beating around the bush nope no it's not it's absolutely not I just straight

10735
09:08:27,380 --> 09:08:36,180
upset what what I uh sorry you know actually I can tell you something that was really terrible

10736
09:08:37,300 --> 09:08:45,300
so if all the development issues hadn't occurred I actually fully was going to

10737
09:08:48,660 --> 09:08:51,700
are you squinting me uh hold on I don't know what you think

10738
09:08:51,780 --> 09:08:54,420
giant s for content one day totally

10739
09:08:56,660 --> 09:09:01,220
um I'm freaking happy to make it anonymous it doesn't bother me like I like it I don't

10740
09:09:01,220 --> 09:09:07,380
mind at all um I don't like the you die ones I don't like that I like the ones where you just

10741
09:09:07,380 --> 09:09:12,100
kind of appear on the other end all fine and good maybe a bit moody because you accidentally

10742
09:09:12,100 --> 09:09:18,420
got swallowed or something like that um she's letting the intrusive thoughts went honestly though

10743
09:09:19,140 --> 09:09:24,180
this is terrible so if all the development issues didn't happen all the girls were posting

10744
09:09:24,180 --> 09:09:29,380
like all these audios on twitter and I was like oh I should probably do one as well but like

10745
09:09:29,380 --> 09:09:36,820
after debut and I thought wouldn't it not be really terrible if I may or may not have been

10746
09:09:36,820 --> 09:09:38,820
um

10747
09:09:39,780 --> 09:09:50,020
plug uh during like debut and after and then once the stream ended I would go record and like

10748
09:09:50,020 --> 09:09:56,660
do something with it and then finish and then post it and you know so that was my idea but

10749
09:09:56,660 --> 09:10:03,140
obviously that all crumbled apart thanks to development issues um but yeah I thought it would

10750
09:10:03,220 --> 09:10:10,500
be pretty good but that would have been amazing unfortunately it's not possible it's not possible

10751
09:10:11,540 --> 09:10:16,660
um there was so many developmental issues in time and I could absolutely strangle some people but

10752
09:10:16,660 --> 09:10:22,820
that's just what happens like literally um oh sorry there was a refling that messaged me that

10753
09:10:22,820 --> 09:10:29,700
apologized for criticizing the company for saying like oh it'd be better if the girls could make their

10754
09:10:29,700 --> 09:10:36,900
designs please don't feel bad I absolutely completely get where you come from um just for

10755
09:10:37,540 --> 09:10:44,260
how do I keep doing that I'll give up um please don't feel bad about saying that like you said

10756
09:10:44,260 --> 09:10:50,660
it in a nice way we had some negative criticism that was like oh premade model actually one of

10757
09:10:50,660 --> 09:10:59,540
the most bizarre criticisms we got um was what was it it was like oh they don't even have talents

10758
09:10:59,620 --> 09:11:05,780
ready when we opened up auditions and it was like yeah you're fucking Egypt we didn't have talents so

10759
09:11:05,780 --> 09:11:10,340
we're opening auditions like every other Vtuber agency but when we do it it's bad but when

10760
09:11:10,340 --> 09:11:16,180
everyone else does it it's fine and that was like what it was the most bizarre thing I had ever read

10761
09:11:16,180 --> 09:11:26,100
honestly um we have plenty of time for future fun literally opened up auditions and someone was like

10762
09:11:26,100 --> 09:11:31,540

10768
09:12:05,380 --> 09:12:12,420
we don't have workers because we're not open yet many baffled honestly it was bizarre like I remember

10769
09:12:12,500 --> 09:12:19,140
reading it actually there's a reflin it must have been a reflin it must have been a reflin

10770
09:12:19,140 --> 09:12:24,660
because you made me he haul my arse off and I can remember the quote because I used to quote it

10771
09:12:24,660 --> 09:12:29,380
because someone defended the agency they must I think they're a reflin or possibly just someone

10772
09:12:29,380 --> 09:12:34,500
who's enthusiastic about the girls in general so someone criticized the company because they were

10773
09:12:34,500 --> 09:12:41,540
like oh another agency where you have to give up your model to work with them and get their

10774
09:12:41,700 --> 09:12:47,060
premade models or whatever and then someone commented and replied to them and there was like

10775
09:12:47,780 --> 09:12:54,020
no one wants your ugliest sin model like that was to the quote your ugly as sin model oh

10776
09:12:55,300 --> 09:13:01,540
I wish I could have interacted with it because it made me he haul so badly

10777
09:13:01,540 --> 09:13:09,780
is that no one wants your ugly as sin model oh my god I literally was like getting so close

10781
09:13:37,140 --> 09:13:42,820

10782
09:13:42,820 --> 09:13:47,460
want to give up my model type thing and I don't want this I don't want that like basically complaining

10783
09:13:47,460 --> 09:13:51,300
about the agency and it was like rub one you've not even applied two you're not interested so

10784
09:13:51,300 --> 09:13:57,460
three shut the fuck up and then some reflin or just someone who was a good fan come swiping in

10785
09:13:57,460 --> 09:14:03,140
and replies what I was basically thinking no one wants your ugliest sin model and I'm like

10786
09:14:03,860 --> 09:14:10,340
it's so good it's so funny anyway so you made my day whoever whoever like came

10788
09:14:16,340 --> 09:14:23,460
member I appreciate it the membership stream start next week uh you've got plenty uh it's a bit warm

10789
09:14:23,460 --> 09:14:28,980
not gonna lie a bit hot in here yeah a bit bit sweaty out here surprised the bank hasn't caught

10790
09:14:28,980 --> 09:14:35,620
on fire honestly um I forgive her she's tired and forgot how to read oh no what did I miss me

10791
09:14:36,180 --> 09:14:42,580
oh what are you yapping about scrawny is she be cooking so I think she has allured to something

10792
09:14:42,580 --> 09:14:47,780
which I'm more than happy for her to um but I don't think she's fully said what it is and I don't

10793
09:14:47,780 --> 09:14:52,100
want to ruin it because it's quite a nice thing I think it's quite a nice thing and it's like the

10794
09:14:52,100 --> 09:15:01,940
most basic common courtesy thing um allured she'd be allured to it there were some abysmally uh stupid

10795
09:15:01,940 --> 09:15:11,220
to take from a flume it's just the way the guy typed the message I just constantly remember the

10796
09:15:11,220 --> 09:15:20,580
phrase ugliest sin model I like oh my god talking about like catching straight like oh my god I don't

10797
09:15:20,580 --> 09:15:29,300
think I could recover if someone was like your ugliest sin model ah oh my god love it love it love

10798
09:15:29,300 --> 09:15:40,020
it love it um mommy you have broken youtube we are going for 6.1 subs oh my god the video what is

10799
09:15:40,020 --> 09:15:46,500
the video honestly that funny I'm like I'm second guessing myself I'm like what's the video truly that

10800
09:15:46,500 --> 09:15:50,180
entertaining like I was just kind of saying please a lot by the end of it and started like

10801
09:15:50,180 --> 09:15:56,180
breathing in the mic really weird I only know one agency that lets their talents pick their models

10802
09:15:56,180 --> 09:16:05,220
literally I've only heard one other agency do it as well um but I'm quite happy for the girls like

10803
09:16:05,220 --> 09:16:09,540
to design their 2.0 like Emmy designed her 2.0 like I'm more than happy if she wants if that

10804
09:16:09,540 --> 09:16:14,900
makes her happier and all that then jeez what am I gonna fucking say about it nothing oh guys as

10805
09:16:14,900 --> 09:16:21,060
long as the girls are happy they're happy um I made mommy ink herself has my whole life been a

10806
09:16:21,060 --> 09:16:28,500
mistake is this peak content for you from uh also the amount of people that could not read oh I felt

10807
09:16:28,500 --> 09:16:38,100
so bad actually we had one Japanese girl um apply and I felt so bad because she had such a lovely

10808
09:16:38,100 --> 09:16:44,740
voice but she could hardly speak any English and I was like it's not gonna work it's such a shame

10809
09:16:45,460 --> 09:16:53,700
she had worked for a previous agency um and I think google translate was helping her through

10810
09:16:53,700 --> 09:17:00,340
the page and she inquired on the website and I felt so bad being like bro you can't speak English

10811
09:17:00,340 --> 09:17:07,220
I can't have you there is actually a Russian person that reached out as well she was like I know you

10812
09:17:07,220 --> 09:17:12,980
I know your agency's English but can I stream in Russian and have a Russian audience and I'm like

10813
09:17:13,620 --> 09:17:18,980
ah yes let us the English VTuber agency come out with talents that where I can't even like

10814
09:17:18,980 --> 09:17:25,540
moderate what you're doing or saying like what some folk had like don't get me wrong we're lenient

10815
09:17:25,540 --> 09:17:32,900
but we do have to say like that's not even possible like what you're asking for isn't even possible

10816
09:17:34,100 --> 09:17:40,660
um that was a shame I loved Amy's 2.0 design I'm glad I'm glad I think she had a lot of fun

10817
09:17:40,660 --> 09:17:52,660
designing her 2.0 um so yeah how good was good as application what good is still a thingy

10818
09:17:52,660 --> 09:17:57,380
oh you want to trade with me hold on let me put my swordfish away I'll trade with you what's up

10819
09:17:58,260 --> 09:18:08,980
what's up low leaflin maybe oh it's so what is this are these donuts to put around your

10820
09:18:09,380 --> 09:18:15,460
disc of returning disc of returning yellow boots yellow gloves what

10821
09:18:17,860 --> 09:18:20,980
what have you given me what does it look like activate

10822
09:18:22,580 --> 09:18:30,260
you can only enter thordor's black hole from the dwarven mains are you sitting literally I

10823
09:18:30,260 --> 09:18:36,340
thought this is a weebie ring as well are you giving me your weebie ring am I putting shoes on

10824
09:18:37,300 --> 09:18:45,460
okay I got shoes on I've got gloves on oh now I look like I really work I think it's a helpful

10825
09:18:45,460 --> 09:18:51,940
tool that will come in handy later that's so ominous this is a helpful tool that'll help you later

10826
09:18:51,940 --> 09:18:55,940
what do you mean that's so ominous what am I supposed to do about that

10827
09:18:56,500 --> 09:19:08,340
I I get you miss 100% of the shots but some people just don't get it it was a shame like I felt

10828
09:19:08,340 --> 09:19:15,140
really bad for the Japanese girl she was nothing but polite well mannered um and like obviously I

10829
09:19:15,140 --> 09:19:19,860
can't say too much of the message but basically she'd worked in another agency before it didn't work

10830
09:19:19,860 --> 09:19:26,180
out and and she was like really excited at the prospect and she already had all the experience

10831
09:19:26,180 --> 09:19:33,540
type thing but she just couldn't speak English and I can't be like given lead script examples where

10832
09:19:33,540 --> 09:19:38,020
she mimics what I'm seeing because then she's gonna end up just sounding like me type thing when it

10833
09:19:38,020 --> 09:19:43,220
comes to trying to mix it was a shame it was a shame because it would have been a very interesting mix

10834
09:19:44,180 --> 09:19:53,380
you can stack donuts on it Japanese branch when no there will be no spin-offs

10835
09:19:54,500 --> 09:20:04,420
absolutely no spin-offs at viola um I am I am three gents and I am done I have nothing else to

10836
09:20:04,420 --> 09:20:11,940
produce or give to this beautiful world I will give my daughters um my gen one my gen two my

10837
09:20:11,940 --> 09:20:19,140
gen three and I am done I cannot handle anymore I am I'm at capacity there is too much lights off

10838
09:20:19,140 --> 09:20:23,620
a plappening happen I can't keep up with you as refluence I can't keep up with you as

10839
09:20:24,260 --> 09:20:30,260
and someone was worried about a male branch I assure you that male branch idea is dead in the

10840
09:20:30,260 --> 09:20:39,060
ditch I am not even touching it with a ten foot pole um someone asked I did get a few inquiries

10841
09:20:39,620 --> 09:20:46,180
on the website saying are you interested in doing a safer work branch um the answer is no

10842
09:20:47,620 --> 09:20:53,300
I don't mean to sound so blunt with that but the answer is no you might as well go to any other

10843
09:20:53,300 --> 09:20:58,260
agency go apply to any other agency if you're if you're interested in the safer work the reason

10844
09:20:58,260 --> 09:21:02,260
why you don't get such a good cut in other agencies is because they're greedy cons but that's okay

10845
09:21:02,260 --> 09:21:08,260
though because you know is what it is no point in no point in beating around the bush no point in

10846
09:21:08,260 --> 09:21:16,340
beating around the bush um safer work branch kind of defeats the purpose literally like at that

10847
09:21:16,340 --> 09:21:27,140
point might as well just start like a whole different agency and all that jazz um but I am done I have

10848
09:21:27,140 --> 09:21:36,420
experienced it it's been fun um Veeler is my child and so are my daughters and the reeflings

10849
09:21:36,420 --> 09:21:41,380
are the father and I'm also pregnant with the reeflings for that asmr and I forgot to commission

10850
09:21:41,380 --> 09:21:47,540
that art I've still not done it I don't do it shouldn't Veeler too electric boogaloo but

10851
09:21:47,540 --> 09:21:55,620
strongy with enough power you can reignite even a dying star no latin american branch no I cannot

10852
09:21:55,620 --> 09:22:04,980
do any uh alternative language speaking branches because I don't speak the language and I don't

10853
09:22:04,980 --> 09:22:13,140
have any trusted advisors that I could overwhelm with the amount of work it takes um like the split

10854
09:22:13,140 --> 09:22:19,300
couldn't be as high if I needed someone on call 24 7 to translate what these girls are trying to

10855
09:22:20,260 --> 09:22:25,860
like it's just it's not possible it's not possible or it's not possible for me possible for other

10856
09:22:25,860 --> 09:22:31,780
agencies not yourself out but after three gents I am done I am helping the girls achieve their

10857
09:22:31,780 --> 09:22:38,660
dreams as much as possible at that point I have no interested in trying to infinitely expand and

10858
09:22:38,660 --> 09:22:44,660
have a billion talents out of once and no that's just no it's so disrespectful as well to the

10859
09:22:45,540 --> 09:22:50,820
to the girls um just being like oh but we're already throwing out the next gen some mailers

they really said loose lips sink ships I can't believe it you almost got me

10903
09:27:25,940 --> 09:27:28,900
it was lovely though oh your whispers can tingle alone

10904
09:27:29,460 --> 09:27:36,980
and I bet you like my whispers I start saying you just get ready to go to sleep

10905
09:27:36,980 --> 09:27:46,020
yeah normally these ones I'd stay up go to sleep or just play summer escape a little without

10906
09:27:51,700 --> 09:27:55,620
the hypnosis then just made me imagine you gengar

10907
09:27:56,580 --> 09:28:01,700
yeah gengar the hypnosis

10908
09:28:05,060 --> 09:28:11,300
might be the lullaby or the two kilograms of cocaína just no no I'll sleep when mom

10909
09:28:11,300 --> 09:28:19,220
sleeps just so lovely thank you mom oh thank you uh when the stream ends

10910
09:28:19,220 --> 09:28:22,340
emi and ac's memberships are gonna go

10911
09:28:23,940 --> 09:28:30,420
live because I'm gonna put them live because I'm such a good little streamer

10912
09:28:32,660 --> 09:28:38,100
such a good little streamer streamer no this doesn't make me a streamer

10913
09:28:39,700 --> 09:28:46,980
manager no I'm a little manager I just do the intern work and it keeps the stress off of them

10914
09:28:46,980 --> 09:28:52,420
as long as the girl's stress levels are low and I will I will be very happy

10915
09:28:59,620 --> 09:29:04,500
the point is to consume hypno content so much it conditions you it will work eventually

10916
09:29:04,500 --> 09:29:08,980
taking over a decade from when I became interested until I felt my first vision

10917
09:29:09,460 --> 09:29:13,220
mmm it was drowsy

10918
09:29:15,060 --> 09:29:26,500
yes I will my bedtime is 5 p.m. actually it's 1 p.m. right now and we've still got another what

10919
09:29:26,500 --> 09:29:36,660
two and a half hours yeah so then that would take me to what four p.m so I have one hour

10920
09:29:36,660 --> 09:29:44,820
basically to do all the stuff that I'm supposed to do and then I pass out and then when I wake up

10921
09:29:44,820 --> 09:29:51,940
I prepare for stream with a cup of honey tea and then I open up crash bandicoot warped and make

10922
09:29:51,940 --> 09:29:58,820
sure you guys can hear it and see it and then we go again and I believe tomorrow is eight hour

10923
09:29:58,820 --> 09:30:05,140
stream it's not endurance to finish the game it's eight hours would it be mean to let you know

10924
09:30:05,140 --> 09:30:17,460
you're 10% of the way to 99 what 10% of the way

10925
09:30:20,500 --> 09:30:24,420
I thought I could get it finished this month I don't think so

10926
09:30:24,820 --> 09:30:35,860
10% there oh yay oh no do you want to know the amount of exp required

10927
09:30:37,540 --> 09:30:45,780
it's 13 million oh I'm 10% of the way that so every million is like I guess

10928
09:30:46,340 --> 09:30:58,100
what 1.3 percent every million wait every million is 10.3 percent surely that's how it works is that

10929
09:30:58,100 --> 09:31:09,700
how math works break it down into chunks um 98 to 99 is like 1.2 million oh my god

10930
09:31:10,020 --> 09:31:15,780
peanut the forest is here you should be able to do it

10931
09:31:18,020 --> 09:31:24,900
every 1.3 million is 10 percent okay so we're just over 10 percent now okay that's not bad

10932
09:31:24,900 --> 09:31:32,740
we'll finish the sword fish I think we can finish the sword fish before the end of the stream and then

10933
09:31:33,700 --> 09:31:42,580
we'll tackle wine I'm going to buy a bunch of wine stuff and we're basically gonna watch a movie

10934
09:31:44,900 --> 09:31:51,380
while we do it so we can all giggle and laugh at movie um I think we'll do John Wick

10935
09:31:52,900 --> 09:31:58,340
this is perfect zatsu content and rambling yeah I did look at marshmallows I don't know

10936
09:31:58,580 --> 09:32:03,220
have many more marshmallows a lot of the marshmallows I can't really read for obvious reason

10937
09:32:03,940 --> 09:32:10,180
because refillings are a little okay let me check if there are any more

10938
09:32:11,380 --> 09:32:17,540
marshmallows oh okay definitely a few more marshmallows hold on let's go uh

10939
09:32:21,220 --> 09:32:24,660
oh no are you guys berating me because I lost four in a row

10940
09:32:28,820 --> 09:32:32,660
uh

10941
09:32:35,860 --> 09:32:42,660
uh I was split between giving my veal or membership uh cherry to emmy or to mercy

10942
09:32:43,300 --> 09:32:47,460
because each of the girls are intense young dairies and don't want their fans to flirt with

10943
09:32:47,460 --> 09:32:52,340
other girls then I remembered all the good times from hanging in your stream and I saw the third

10944
09:32:52,340 --> 09:32:58,900
option you me no you're supposed to support my daughters strongy sometimes during or after

10945
09:32:58,900 --> 09:33:02,980
emmy's membership opening I'm going to make a decision you're a strong prick I won't overlook

10946
09:33:02,980 --> 09:33:10,740
you when deciding refling or or pinpal or snippet whatever one you may be um please always support

10947
09:33:10,740 --> 09:33:17,780
my daughters over me if you can only support one at a time um please pick either daughter if you

10948
09:33:17,780 --> 09:33:23,140
struggle to pick between a daughter pick the design the default design you like the most

10949
09:33:23,780 --> 09:33:28,740
that's the easiest the most simplistic way to do it because your brain will either go I like this

10950
09:33:28,740 --> 09:33:33,300
design the most or I like that oh my god I thought Gimli was in the room there I had a heart attack

10951
09:33:33,300 --> 09:33:38,340
I always get nervous about spiders uh I don't like them um mostly there's a spider like a

10952
09:33:38,340 --> 09:33:47,140
working in the room can we add pictures or videos to marshmallows um you can via cat box um

10953
09:33:48,580 --> 09:33:53,540
if you want to show me something but you have to do the link and you have to make it easy

10954
09:33:54,260 --> 09:33:59,780
just remove the dot and put dot in brackets because if you do it any other way I'm too

10955
09:33:59,780 --> 09:34:04,020
pepega and can't open it off it's literally a logic puzzle to open up a link with when you

10956
09:34:04,020 --> 09:34:09,940
don't give me the link it's okay strongy we'll comfort you after this losses there there

10957
09:34:09,940 --> 09:34:15,620

10968
09:35:18,820 --> 09:35:24,740

10969
09:35:24,740 --> 09:35:29,620
I'm sorry strongy but I choose you you speak to me on a whole another level I love you cameo she

10970
09:35:29,700 --> 09:35:31,860
no you can't call me cameo she

10971
09:35:34,580 --> 09:35:40,020
well you do more twitter mosaic responses to the marshmallows yes I've been wanting to do it

10972
09:35:40,020 --> 09:35:46,180
and update it terribly terribly badly for a long time because I really enjoy writing the scenarios

10973
09:35:46,180 --> 09:35:50,740
to you guys like when you guys give me like a little prompt or something and I just take it way

10974
09:35:50,740 --> 09:35:58,420
too far it's my favorite thing to do uh yes I will definitely be doing that again soon it's just

10975
09:35:59,140 --> 09:36:05,220
every I say this every stream as the dust settles and all the little mini side projects get pushed

10976
09:36:05,220 --> 09:36:09,940
out the way then I can start to like really catch up because like whenever I do those two

10977
09:36:09,940 --> 09:36:15,220
other streams I'm catching up and like I'm literally going to the doctors after buckshot

10978
09:36:15,220 --> 09:36:24,740
roulette and then I'll be healing up for a bit um so ASMR with the viewer viewer beats you in a

10979
09:36:24,740 --> 09:36:30,980
board game a bunch till we let you win and then space you time to celebrate the victory honestly

10980
09:36:30,980 --> 09:36:40,660
that's quite funny um you being so silly not very bright and cute at the same time makes me want to

10981
09:36:42,340 --> 09:36:47,860
run and tackle you under the bed and cuddle you I would hug you and roll around under the covers

10982
09:36:47,860 --> 09:36:51,540
and never let you go where's can I explain how much I love you you're my sunshine oh you're my

10983
09:36:51,540 --> 09:37:00,180
sunshine are you playing uh you like when I'm dumb you like when I show how unbelievably

10984
09:37:00,180 --> 09:37:08,740
braindead I am yeah is that what you like sorry but you're being hard locked as my wishy-dus

10985
09:37:10,660 --> 09:37:16,500
we sure do oh allegedly why is it so hard to play freaking connect four

10986
09:37:16,500 --> 09:37:19,940
I don't know why it's so hard

10987
09:37:23,780 --> 09:37:29,540
she be just woke up and said I woke up a bit ago dizzy but wanting to be ravaged okay she

10988
09:37:29,540 --> 09:37:36,740
be she's doing better with her migraine you are more of a mother to me than my own parents and

10989
09:37:36,740 --> 09:37:42,420
I hardly even know you you are welcome well I didn't mean you're welcome like that but um

10990
09:37:42,980 --> 09:37:52,180
um sometimes it's a bit sucky but some people might not necessarily be the best parents

10991
09:37:52,820 --> 09:38:02,580
and sometimes it's easier to just take a deep breath and sigh and say they did the best with

10992
09:38:02,580 --> 09:38:10,980
what they had at the time with what they got and sometimes it's not easy to swallow the truth and

10993
09:38:11,060 --> 09:38:19,780
be like oh that really wasn't as nice because you know when you watch media it's like oh the loving

10994
09:38:19,780 --> 09:38:28,100
parents they they're so supportive they're so this or so that sometimes it's a hard pill to swallow

10995
09:38:28,100 --> 09:38:34,900
to say that you drew an unlucky hand and that might not necessarily mean you don't still share a love

10996
09:38:34,900 --> 09:38:43,460
for your primary caregivers um but there are some phrases in the English language that's like

10997
09:38:43,460 --> 09:38:49,620
the blood of the covenant is thicker than the water of the womb which basically just means the

10998
09:38:49,620 --> 09:38:59,860
connections that you seek out in life that are outside of your family can be just as valid if

10999
09:38:59,860 --> 09:39:06,580
not more loving than family because you don't pick family you don't you don't pick these aspects and

11000
09:39:07,620 --> 09:39:14,740
sometimes it's just easier to it's not easy to swallow the pill but sometimes it's easier to

11001
09:39:14,740 --> 09:39:24,020
just take a deep breath let out a big sigh and be like okay that's just how it is and I hope you're

11002
09:39:24,020 --> 09:39:33,300
doing okay yeah it it sucks but I'm I'm glad um you can feel a degree of motherly love um

11003
09:39:34,500 --> 09:39:41,780
you know I don't think anyone should be embarrassed or uh what's the word kind of like it's only human

11004
09:39:41,780 --> 09:39:52,340
nature to crave um to crave attention to crave love to create to crave these positive reinforcers

11005
09:39:52,900 --> 09:39:58,900
that show that you're a part of a community that you're welcome that you're wanted so don't ever

11006
09:39:58,900 --> 09:40:05,140
you know don't feel embarrassed about that just you know if you're needing kind of a way to to

11007
09:40:05,140 --> 09:40:11,860
put it away uh deep down inside you just let one big sigh and say yeah you know what that's

11008
09:40:11,860 --> 09:40:18,500
fucked that situation's fucked but I'm here I'm doing it I'm crushing life you know I've gotten

donate give money all that jazz free content always coming brov life is freaking hard especially

11044
09:44:21,460 --> 09:44:28,340
much more valuable much more important that you look after yourself that you look after whatever

11045
09:44:28,340 --> 09:44:34,900
situation you're in if you have debts you pay them off if you need a sweet treat you indulge in it

11046
09:44:35,380 --> 09:44:42,180
if you you know after work you need to play video games to de-stress make sure your internet

11047
09:44:42,180 --> 09:44:47,940
bill is paid and make sure your electricity bill is paid so you have access to these abilities to

11048
09:44:47,940 --> 09:44:53,780
de-stress to handle the work day to handle the workflow or to handle any life stresses that you

11049
09:44:53,780 --> 09:45:00,740
might be going through um there are just countless situations where people are just going through

11050
09:45:00,740 --> 09:45:06,180
hell on earth on the inside and on the outside they look perfectly fine and you'd have absolutely no

11051
09:45:06,180 --> 09:45:12,980
clue what on earth is going on with them and you know the last thing people want to be dealing with

11052
09:45:12,980 --> 09:45:20,180
is um just this stress that builds and builds and builds and builds and builds until you pop

11053
09:45:20,180 --> 09:45:25,860
people pop people have burnout people have breakdowns like you can pop so easily so make sure

11054
09:45:26,580 --> 09:45:31,140
and you know you're looking after yourself first because at the end of the day you are the most

11055
09:45:31,140 --> 09:45:36,500
important person in your life and that's the fact for everyone's pov right now you are the most

11056
09:45:36,500 --> 09:45:41,940
important person in your life it's the way it works okay and you have to look after yourself

11057
09:45:41,940 --> 09:45:46,420
first you have to make sure that you're feeling good you have to you have to enable yourself

11058
09:45:46,900 --> 09:45:53,860
um to be on your prime like i'll wipe out mazl's hierarchy and needs right now do not think i won't

11059
09:45:53,860 --> 09:45:59,460
do it i will start a psychology lecture right this second i will put my teacher's glasses on

11060
09:45:59,460 --> 09:46:04,100
and it is very important to meet your needs first before you ever try and meet the needs of someone

11061
09:46:04,100 --> 09:46:10,580
else however the exception is that a the stupid sentence i've heard is uh love yourself first

11062
09:46:10,580 --> 09:46:13,860
before you love someone else or something like that shut the fuck up that's the most nonsense

11063
09:46:13,860 --> 09:46:19,140
statement i've ever heard everyone can share the love to any degree and that's my take on that sense

11064
09:46:19,380 --> 09:46:28,260
um you can share love at any point it is simple to share a little bit of love glasses toggle

11065
09:46:28,260 --> 09:46:36,100
no not glasses toggle i never got glasses on my model uh this is helping me procrastinate my

11066
09:46:36,100 --> 09:46:44,900
final oh no that's not good damn i fell asleep for 13 hours and you're still screaming yeah do you

09:48:39,540 --> 09:48:46,900
penicillin because of his beliefs and bob marley that this is love this is love this is love that

11085
09:48:47,140 --> 09:48:52,420
i'm feeling that singer passed away because he rejected penicillin

11086

11094
09:49:48,180 --> 09:49:54,500
can be incredibly deadly for some people which is crazy um i'm pretty sure the guy who discovered

11095
09:49:54,500 --> 09:50:00,020
penicillin did it by a complete accident as well which was rather interesting uh it was just a

11096
09:50:00,020 --> 09:50:05,060
complete accident it casually discovers something that saves literally millions of lives can't uh

11097
09:50:05,060 --> 09:50:09,860
you know just get a little casual probably in the billions as time goes on easily a billion lives

11098
09:50:09,860 --> 09:50:17,140
saved because of little accidental petri dish discovery um truly fascinating fascinating

11099
09:50:19,060 --> 09:50:23,780

11133
09:54:38,180 --> 09:54:44,260
pretty close unless i'm like completely like misreader but i'd say she's probably the closest

11134
09:54:45,860 --> 09:54:48,900
uh personality wise and easiest to consume

11135
09:54:54,180 --> 09:54:57,780
uh i would love to share some fanfics but i don't know if it's appropriate even a lot do you

11136
09:54:57,780 --> 09:55:04,580
can but if it is weird us of metal uh i think you can do pace bin links i think those are safe

11137
09:55:04,980 --> 09:55:13,940
hi strongy hi refling did you know the term architect and features and comes from the irish

11138
09:55:13,940 --> 09:55:24,180
actor pierce raw brosnan who is rumored to have intentionally made his wife gain 100 pounds over

11139
09:55:24,180 --> 09:55:31,300
the course of 20 years the term itself is from a quote made on the architects of peace home page

11140
09:55:31,300 --> 09:55:37,300
a world without wheels it's too terrible to imagine he did not write a book and call it that

11141
09:55:38,820 --> 09:55:44,500
stop is that why he did wait is that from a book he wrote

11142
09:55:47,060 --> 09:55:52,900
oh my god that's outrageous outrageous but really funny

11143
09:55:53,620 --> 09:56:02,980
i like how ic is sweet and emmy is false to the wall insane

11144
09:56:04,820 --> 09:56:07,380
i will continue myself right now go to sleep

11145
09:56:09,140 --> 09:56:15,780
hi strongy your way of gentle talking is one of my favorite triggers i think if you did scott's

11146
09:56:16,500 --> 09:56:26,260
it'd be amazing is there a way to control my well on stream on youtube funny you mentioned that

11147
09:56:37,220 --> 09:56:44,580
have you considered using uh bitmosis to plant suggestions that are wholly positive and affirming

11148
09:56:44,580 --> 09:56:49,300
for the viewer something to encourage them when they're down to give them that little push when

11149
09:56:49,300 --> 09:56:54,980
they're low don't don't want to do the dishes strongy would want you to don't want to cook and

11150
09:56:54,980 --> 09:57:00,020
just want to order out strongy would want you to cook strongy would want me to live my best life

11151
09:57:00,020 --> 09:57:09,540
that's interesting i'm wondering if i could do a putting you to sleep asmr but it's secretly

11152
09:57:09,620 --> 09:57:16,580
hypnosis and then after you've fallen asleep then i would do like that kind of

11153
09:57:17,700 --> 09:57:26,500
in in in planting you've got me thinking a lot of each one you've got me thinking the cogs are

11154
09:57:26,500 --> 09:57:34,820
turning you got me at help you go to sleep yes i think you could do it if you establish triggers

11155
09:57:34,820 --> 09:57:45,220
outside of youtube and use of any issue asi is way more insane i thought emi was uh having fun

11156
09:57:48,500 --> 09:57:53,620
asi's just yeah she doesn't like sharing of g fog sand sands or something that

11157
09:57:53,620 --> 09:58:01,300
has been sent somewhere else she doesn't like that that would be perfect imprinting on me oh my god

11158
09:58:01,540 --> 09:58:02,900
hypnosis is

11159
09:58:08,180 --> 09:58:09,540

via withdraws item because i'm currently wanting to interact with the items that i'm pulling out

11253

11324
10:17:08,100 --> 10:17:13,700
when i stream all day i have no clue what shenanigans the girls are getting up to in all honors though

11325
10:17:31,380 --> 10:17:35,380

11326
10:17:37,620 --> 10:17:45,620
wait that video is still getting recommended to people 24 000 views 2 000 likes i wonder if

11327
10:17:45,620 --> 10:17:54,580
because people are liking it strongy has the best boing boing azura has biggest boing boing

11328
10:17:54,580 --> 10:18:00,260
or do you mean rump i have the biggest rump

11329
10:18:04,740 --> 10:18:10,420
all the perfect all the all the better to smother you with three flights she's out

11330
10:18:10,420 --> 10:18:15,380
pealard anything that ever happened the audio after this it takes a day do you think you'll

11331
10:18:15,380 --> 10:18:20,420
feel accomplished when you get night and then cooking i hope so i'm in the trenches right now

11332
10:18:20,420 --> 10:18:21,460
on this swordfish

11333
10:18:24,820 --> 10:18:28,020
she accidentally played the clip on stream she forgot to turn off this

11334
10:18:34,900 --> 10:18:38,980
oh you can pass away if you drink too much water she actually uploaded it to me

11335
10:18:39,460 --> 10:18:39,940
ah

11336
10:18:42,420 --> 10:18:48,740
uh okay okay okay okay she already has a warning on her channel

11337
10:18:50,180 --> 10:18:54,260
Amy playing with fire but then again she is the pyromaniac of uh

11338
10:18:55,140 --> 10:19:00,660
veal or so right i'm right on par i can't believe i can't believe i found such a

11339
10:19:00,660 --> 10:19:02,820
lower friendly girl's smile

11340
10:19:06,420 --> 10:19:13,700
i have to admit i think i'm starting to lag a bit it's not looking good for me slowly

11341
10:19:13,700 --> 10:19:21,140
perishing i'm like dad make a tea but i don't think it's gonna wake me up but i think it's gonna

11342
10:19:21,700 --> 10:19:27,540
uh oh my stomach's making freaking weird ass noises can you hear that

11343
10:19:33,140 --> 10:19:36,980
what will come first heat death of the universe or full inventory no burn

11344
10:19:36,980 --> 10:19:41,860
honestly i feel like i'm getting so close to it and i'm getting although the burn percentage

11345
10:19:41,860 --> 10:19:49,700
is 9.4 it used to be 18.9 she cut it out from the vod we're safe question mark i'm firmly of the

11346
10:19:49,700 --> 10:19:59,460
opinion there's such a thing as being too big what's 99 after cooking no we're just doing cooking

11347
10:19:59,460 --> 10:20:06,340
we might do some questing together because i'm not familiar with a lot of quests um but that would

11348
10:20:06,340 --> 10:20:13,380
just be very casual um probably level up combat a little bit before that um once we've achieved

11349
10:20:13,380 --> 10:20:24,100
99 cooking um i am not 99ing anything else i have severely underestimated how much this is

11350
10:20:29,220 --> 10:20:35,540
a strong expect full to the kaboom if you ever do the cat quest you have to feed it when it's a

11351
10:20:35,540 --> 10:20:41,380
kitten or it runs away that's so specific i'm probably never gonna retain this information

11352
10:20:44,180 --> 10:20:48,660
i'm going to go for a full 99 account for the first time oh you're brave

11353
10:20:50,260 --> 10:20:56,980
and the other version of runescape levels go up to 120 did they take even longer to achieve

11354
10:21:00,500 --> 10:21:05,940
oh that's crazy sorry oh i'm having a wee on sorry

11355
10:21:06,900 --> 10:21:22,500
oh my god i'm in the money lads i'm sorry i really don't want to flex on you guys but we're in the money

11356
10:21:23,220 --> 10:21:24,740
oh

11357
10:21:33,460 --> 10:21:39,940
look ah whoa fill inventory no burn get ready get ready to ever said no burn

11358
10:21:42,980 --> 10:21:47,940
hold on hold on hold on so this is what it looked like a minute ago

11359
10:21:48,260 --> 10:21:56,260
so that was the last time i shared it with you 19.8 okay and the money didn't register but now the

11360
10:21:56,260 --> 10:22:05,460
money's registered are you ready to get flexed on where is it are you ready to get flexed on how

11361
10:22:05,460 --> 10:22:13,300
much money i made on that video boom that's right get flexed on to say that gen 2 has been funded

11362
10:22:13,300 --> 10:22:17,780
is an understatement that's how much money i've made what are you gonna do about them

11363
10:22:21,620 --> 10:22:27,940
it got limited ads so it probably would have been like 20 bucks if it wasn't limited ads

11364
10:22:27,940 --> 10:22:32,740
but you know what 10 bucks i'll take you you'll be logged out in 30 minutes make sure you move

11365
10:22:32,740 --> 10:22:39,700

11366
10:22:39,700 --> 10:22:46,740

11367
10:22:47,300 --> 10:22:52,100
pass on that no thanks how do people make a living off of youtube oh it's much better than

11368
10:22:52,100 --> 10:23:00,340
this when you have like a a lot of ASMR videos to offer um you make like money generated in the

11369
10:23:00,340 --> 10:23:05,620
background right i'm going to go make a cup of tea and let this game log me out um i will be back

11370
10:23:05,620 --> 10:23:08,100

You

You

11378
10:27:29,780 --> 10:27:31,780
You

11379
10:27:59,780 --> 10:28:01,780
You

11380
10:28:29,780 --> 10:28:31,780
You

11381
10:28:59,780 --> 10:29:01,780
You

11382
10:29:30,780 --> 10:29:36,460
Oh, it's actually quite a lot louder than in-game audio. Sorry if that like completely destroyed your ears

11383
10:29:36,660 --> 10:29:38,660
Hope no one's sleeping through this

11384
10:29:39,260 --> 10:29:42,580
Her account has gone too. Wait, who's the count? Look at that

11385
10:29:48,020 --> 10:29:50,020
What was I doing?

11386
10:29:50,020 --> 10:29:52,020
fish fish fish

11387
10:29:52,660 --> 10:29:57,740
I am starting to pass out. I'm not gonna lie. I'm getting very tired. I'm a throats way of sore

11388
10:29:59,780 --> 10:30:02,100
Which is why I need refling tea

11389
10:30:03,140 --> 10:30:05,140
Not just any kind of honey tea

11390
10:30:06,180 --> 10:30:08,180
Log out timer is five minutes

11391
10:30:08,340 --> 10:30:13,060
The music was pretty loud. Okay, man. I apologize. I've got honey on my freaking finger as well

11392
10:30:14,660 --> 10:30:20,660
I'm not the good- I'm not my refling honey. I need a special refling honey. The menu music apparently a separate set. Yeah

11393
10:30:22,580 --> 10:30:24,580
Monkey badness

11394
10:30:24,580 --> 10:30:26,580
I

11395
10:30:27,220 --> 10:30:34,740
Sleepy little refling because we're already snows together honestly. Oh, I'm I'm getting tired myself

11396
10:30:44,740 --> 10:30:49,940
Oh gee Hermes, thank you for becoming a member as a remainder

11397
10:30:51,140 --> 10:30:53,140
All membership streams

11398
10:30:53,860 --> 10:30:54,820
No

11399
10:30:54,820 --> 10:30:58,660
Next week membership streams start because I've already locked in what happens this week

11400
10:30:59,460 --> 10:31:01,460
Next week is very busy

11401
10:31:02,580 --> 10:31:04,580
is next week when

11402
10:31:06,100 --> 10:31:06,980
Uh

11403
10:31:06,980 --> 10:31:12,180
Elden Ring comes out. It's today next week Elden Ring DLC comes out. Okay, so

11404
10:31:13,300 --> 10:31:15,300
The start of the week is gonna be like a

11405
10:31:16,260 --> 10:31:20,900
multitude of different things going on. It's a little bit crazy sometimes

11406
10:31:24,100 --> 10:31:28,260
Refling tea you mean ink tea? Exactly. That's what my refling tea is

11407
10:31:29,700 --> 10:31:31,700
Passed it four times, but I got the tea

11408
10:31:33,940 --> 10:31:35,220
I bet oh my god

11409
10:31:35,220 --> 10:31:40,580
I love the stories where it's like my legs are quaking after a good session. I'm like, oh my god

11410
10:31:41,460 --> 10:31:44,660
Oh, no, that's not it is I can't feel my legs after

11411
10:31:45,380 --> 10:31:49,300
How hard I was beating in that session those ones always make me crack up

11412
10:31:50,740 --> 10:31:52,740
What's good

11413
10:31:53,860 --> 10:31:55,860
Uh

11414
10:31:56,580 --> 10:32:02,660
Was good. Uh, we're going 10 and a half hours strong. We're wrapping up an hour

11415
10:32:03,700 --> 10:32:11,140
In less than 30 because of the void restriction. Um, I am going to see if mercy is available

11416
10:32:11,940 --> 10:32:13,940
to read into or a zero

11417
10:32:14,820 --> 10:32:16,820
and

11418
10:32:16,980 --> 10:32:21,700
Oh, my tummy keeps making noises. It's because I need uh, did I end up going for a job?

11419
10:32:22,260 --> 10:32:27,620
No, it wasn't successful. I had an unsuccessful attempt at adjubi, which is why my stomach's making

11420
10:32:28,420 --> 10:32:34,340
Uh, bizarre noises right now. Oh my god. I'm starting to get like full cooked sword run swordfish ones, which is amazing

11421
10:32:34,980 --> 10:32:39,540
Do your reeflings want your money back? Am I undetected brieflings? Oh, no

11422
10:32:39,780 --> 10:32:42,820
Is there any runescape reeflings that I'm indebted to?

11423
10:32:43,620 --> 10:32:45,620
But I don't have any money

11424
10:32:46,020 --> 10:32:51,460
How will I ever repay you runescape reefling for all the things you've done for me?

11425
10:32:51,700 --> 10:32:53,700
I

11426
10:32:55,220 --> 10:32:57,460
Get wrecked and connect for apparently

11427
10:33:00,020 --> 10:33:02,980
Left for a bit and you're still going. Oh, I'm a tough cookie

11428
10:33:03,860 --> 10:33:05,860
Hard hard to get me to crack

11429
10:33:06,260 --> 10:33:10,100
When I say, uh, I need to make up for lost time. Am I I wasn't kidding?

11430
10:33:11,060 --> 10:33:15,220
I wasn't kidding. Uh, literally next week. We've got like four. Maybe even five

11431
10:33:16,020 --> 10:33:17,620
Oh

11432
10:33:17,620 --> 10:33:22,980
Well, please don't be getting sick. I really don't want to get sick. Oh, I'm not gonna make it if I get sick

11433
10:33:23,700 --> 10:33:26,180
I'm not gonna make it. I really don't want to get sick

11434
10:33:30,980 --> 10:33:36,980
Bless you. Thank you. He's on high. I accept ASMR's payment. Oh, yeah

11435
10:33:39,860 --> 10:33:41,860
Poor little

11436
10:33:42,420 --> 10:33:44,420
Needing something

11437
10:33:50,980 --> 10:33:54,020
One hour of agility treatment is payment because I can't be bothered

11438
10:33:54,740 --> 10:33:56,340
bro

11439
10:33:56,340 --> 10:34:02,580
I need to maybe get the agility shortcut wherever it is on the map. It's like 21 to do the grand exchange shortcut

11440
10:34:03,380 --> 10:34:13,940
We formally request snitches. Mmm. Thank you for being my sugar daddy on RuneScape

11441
10:34:16,100 --> 10:34:20,740
Thank you for making it super easy real emmy versus strony connect for

11442
10:34:22,900 --> 10:34:24,900
The real

11443
10:34:25,860 --> 10:34:32,100
Strony milkers warm and tasty strony milkies, please be hasty. Oh my god, that's such a good

11444
10:34:33,620 --> 10:34:38,100
Uh, there's a connect for minigame in RuneScape. There absolutely is. Do you want to know how I know?

11445
10:34:38,100 --> 10:34:44,340
There's a connect for minigame in RuneScape. Uh, I got absolutely annihilated by all the reeflings unanimously at once

11446
10:34:45,060 --> 10:34:51,620
Uh, the only reason I think I won I won one game by tryharding and I won a second game by mistake

11447
10:34:52,020 --> 10:34:54,280
Because the other reefling wasn't paying attention

11448
10:34:56,580 --> 10:34:58,900
And I was literally eating a burrito and I was like

11449
10:34:59,860 --> 10:35:01,860
With my mouth full of a burrito

11450
10:35:05,620 --> 10:35:08,980
If you're going to do agility there's a quest so you can skip a lot of it

11451
10:35:09,780 --> 10:35:11,780
I think when we do 99

11452
10:35:12,420 --> 10:35:16,660
Cookin will probably take a solid break from any RuneScape streams for a bit

11453
10:35:17,060 --> 10:35:22,340
Because there are a few other like multiplayer games I want to like focus on like Elden Rings like the next big

11454
10:35:23,140 --> 10:35:25,140
Like a thing we're taking on

11455
10:35:25,700 --> 10:35:27,700
and

11456
10:35:28,260 --> 10:35:30,260
I don't even hear my stomach

11457
10:35:32,260 --> 10:35:35,300
No, you can't the mic's not cover it is covering up

11458
10:35:36,660 --> 10:35:42,100
The stronies milk tastes like jelly. I even know what cuttlefish milk would taste like

11459
10:35:42,900 --> 10:35:47,300
Would it be gelatinous or would it be silky like ink?

11460
10:35:49,380 --> 10:35:51,380
I think it may be silky

11461
10:35:53,220 --> 10:35:55,220
Worthing

11462
10:35:55,300 --> 10:35:57,140
Love these 20 things

11463
10:35:57,140 --> 10:35:59,140
Thank you for the smoothies

11464
10:35:59,220 --> 10:36:01,220
Also need to be on a members world for uh

11465
10:36:03,460 --> 10:36:07,780
I'm blamed when it comes to board games. I lost fair and square though. Okay. Okay. Okay

11466
10:36:08,660 --> 10:36:15,620
Well, actually who's got the higher IQ reeflings or stronies clearly the reeflings clearly

11467
10:36:23,540 --> 10:36:28,740
Wow, we're at 1.4 on the swordfish we may be able to finish it

11468
10:36:30,340 --> 10:36:33,860
We might just be out of time, but honestly, it's not the biggest deal. However

11469
10:36:34,820 --> 10:36:38,260
You need to give strony the monkey not items. That's so specific

11470
10:36:39,540 --> 10:36:41,540
and

11471
10:36:41,700 --> 10:36:46,260
Eng would be salty if it's anything like squid ink. You've eaten squid ink before

11472
10:36:48,420 --> 10:36:57,460
You've eaten your fellow reeflings before oh, we're in 1.6k territory at 1.6 million monkey not 287

11473
10:36:58,260 --> 10:37:00,260
I blame all my eyes

11474
10:37:00,820 --> 10:37:06,020
I'm on are you eating your fellow reeflings? What's going on here?

11475
10:37:22,340 --> 10:37:23,620
See be honest

11476
10:37:23,620 --> 10:37:26,740
You were just randomly placing the pieces, but I wasn't law

11477
10:37:26,900 --> 10:37:31,380
I was trying to counteract what the reefling was doing. That's the worst part

11478
10:37:31,540 --> 10:37:36,340
I was actually trying to win and I could never see what the reefling was making

11479
10:37:36,660 --> 10:37:43,060
I was too busy trying to like get ahead and make something for me that I couldn't see what the reefling was doing

11480
10:37:46,500 --> 10:37:54,420
Is worse than emmy rip of my jeans what I listen to emmy stream and if I recall correctly my glass prescription is worse than emmy

11481
10:37:54,980 --> 10:37:59,700
Oh emmy cannot see oh my goodness bless her cotton socks. She can't see for

11482
10:38:02,980 --> 10:38:05,700
A reefling's gotta do what he got a scuba doo ba doo

11483
10:38:07,940 --> 10:38:13,460
Yeah, you literally saw what I was doing and then you forgot no because I was trying to like

11484
10:38:14,100 --> 10:38:17,700
I was trying to be like all the reeflings doing this the reeflings doing that right

11485
10:38:17,700 --> 10:38:20,660
So I'm not gonna place one here and then I'd immediately forget

11486
10:38:21,620 --> 10:38:23,620
I

11487
10:38:23,940 --> 10:38:25,940
Mods creases jays

11488
10:38:27,380 --> 10:38:29,380
You really want me to believe that? Yeah

11489
10:38:30,740 --> 10:38:32,740
I was like trying to think ahead

11490
10:38:40,020 --> 10:38:42,420
I believe I can't believe I made it 10 us always

11491
10:38:43,860 --> 10:38:45,860
Feels good, man

11492
10:38:51,620 --> 10:38:53,620
Wow

11493
10:38:54,020 --> 10:38:56,820
Okay, these swordfish are giving me like what

11494
10:38:57,860 --> 10:39:00,900
7k a batch that's not bad

11495
10:39:02,340 --> 10:39:06,180
Honestly not that bad. I know wine is more which is fine

11496
10:39:06,900 --> 10:39:12,020
But I think that's like 7k exp of inventory if I don't burn them all. Okay. Okay

11497
10:39:13,620 --> 10:39:15,620
Well spoke too soon on that one

11498
10:39:16,580 --> 10:39:18,580
I

11499
10:39:19,140 --> 10:39:26,820
Got some level up. It's time to beat on up on connect for strategy. It's like I'm beat strong the next time

11500
10:39:34,420 --> 10:39:39,860
What's my burn percentage? Oh, it's like oh, I guess it's not up to accuracy because I'm logged out

11501
10:39:40,980 --> 10:39:44,180
I got logged out against me will yeah, um

11502
10:39:45,140 --> 10:39:51,700
Right tomorrow's crash bandicoot, which is eight hours. So it's just a long stream in quotation marks

11503
10:39:52,820 --> 10:39:54,820
Not an endurance

11504
10:39:55,060 --> 10:40:00,260
Short stream is two hours. Um, which is buckshot roulette, but that's because I've got the doctor

11505
10:40:03,220 --> 10:40:07,460
And uh, I'll keep you guys up to date on what on earth is happening with me toe

11506
10:40:07,460 --> 10:40:11,460
But it's pretty much decided if you guys want to hold a funeral during buckshot roulette

11507
10:40:12,020 --> 10:40:14,980
You're more than welcome to pour one out for the toe

11508
10:40:16,100 --> 10:40:18,100
It's been a good run, but

11509
10:40:18,420 --> 10:40:21,380
I'm just no fussed for it. Does they make a difference to me?

11510
10:40:22,420 --> 10:40:24,420
To me

11511
10:40:24,980 --> 10:40:26,980
To me

11512
10:40:28,740 --> 10:40:30,580
Riptoe

11513
10:40:30,580 --> 10:40:33,060
It's a great lineup. Yeah, I did um, I

11514
10:40:33,700 --> 10:40:37,140
Want or probably can't do it tonight because I'm going to be shattered

11515
10:40:37,540 --> 10:40:42,660
I need to go put emmy and icys memberships live literally as soon as I end this stream

11516
10:40:44,100 --> 10:40:46,100
So I need to

11517
10:40:46,500 --> 10:40:48,500
What do I need to do?

11518
10:40:50,260 --> 10:40:52,260
I need to

11519
10:40:53,380 --> 10:40:55,380
Do that

11520
10:40:55,860 --> 10:41:00,580
I wanted to look up baltro more because that actually looks like a genuinely fun game

11521
10:41:01,140 --> 10:41:04,020
I just need to comprehend what on earth i'm doing first

11522
10:41:04,500 --> 10:41:09,940
I don't know. Maybe I need to play it offline like off stream for a little bit just to get the hang of it

11523
10:41:11,140 --> 10:41:14,340
Or is it better if streamer plays it for the first time?

11524
10:41:15,300 --> 10:41:18,820
Like I don't think watching other people play it is cheating. I don't know

11525
10:41:19,620 --> 10:41:23,860
Rips a big gripper. You will be missed literally both of them. No, no just the one

11526
10:41:25,460 --> 10:41:30,020
Shawnee caught the da budus. Oh no, do you think I've got da budus?

11527
10:41:30,340 --> 10:41:32,340
Um

11528
10:41:32,420 --> 10:41:33,940
Oh my god

11529
10:41:33,940 --> 10:41:38,500
streamer tries american sweet loses toenails loses toenail within

11530
10:41:39,460 --> 10:41:41,220
one week

11531
10:41:41,220 --> 10:41:43,220
Diabetes hits hard on streamer

11532
10:41:47,060 --> 10:41:50,580
How many features do you see how many where we get no burns?

11533
10:41:54,900 --> 10:41:59,540
How many multiplayer games are on your to-do list multiplayer games are every week

11534
10:42:00,740 --> 10:42:05,380
Um next multiplayer game is elden ring for a while and then

11535
10:42:07,140 --> 10:42:09,140
Probably jellybean

11536
10:42:10,580 --> 10:42:13,860
I love my jellybean. I don't know if they've added more stuff to it

11537
10:42:14,500 --> 10:42:18,820
Um, we never gave dead by daylight ago. I don't know how that would work

11538
10:42:20,340 --> 10:42:26,260
I think I would have to add you guys as friends possibly on steam and then delete everyone at the end

11539
10:42:26,580 --> 10:42:32,420
I don't know. I wanted to give fortnite a shot, but folk were rolling their eyes at fortnite

11540
10:42:32,420 --> 10:42:34,900
But i'm like fortnite's actually know that bad

11541
10:42:35,700 --> 10:42:39,860
As far as i'm aware, they've like added in different game modes and stuff

11542
10:42:40,980 --> 10:42:42,980
um

11543
10:42:45,140 --> 10:42:49,540
I want uh, I would say mario kart but I suck at mario kart and it and

11544
10:42:50,740 --> 10:42:54,100
Like I don't I don't know how to do that new turn feature thing in it

11545
10:42:54,180 --> 10:42:56,340
Like we have to like turn left and right well

11546
10:42:58,420 --> 10:43:00,920
Call it momay win the jellybean game

11547
10:43:04,100 --> 10:43:06,900
It's a meme to hate fortnite at this point

11548
10:43:18,020 --> 10:43:19,700
It's just

11549
10:43:19,700 --> 10:43:22,340
Ever listened to rap city you want to sing it?

11550
10:43:23,300 --> 10:43:29,620
Is this the real life or is this just fantasy?

11551
10:43:31,460 --> 10:43:38,500
Caught in a landslide no escape from reality

11552
10:43:41,380 --> 10:43:45,220
Look in your eyes. I don't know the words and see

11553
10:43:48,020 --> 10:43:50,020
uh

11554
10:43:53,220 --> 10:43:55,140
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no

11555
10:43:57,620 --> 10:44:02,180
So you think you can stop me and make me cry

11556
10:44:04,500 --> 10:44:08,420
So you think I'm just gonna lay down and die

11557
10:44:10,740 --> 10:44:12,740
Oh baby

11558
10:44:14,100 --> 10:44:19,700
Just can't wait to go just can't wait to go here. Is that the word?

11559
10:44:19,700 --> 10:44:23,700
I don't know. I don't know.

11560
10:44:23,700 --> 10:44:25,700
Um...

11561
10:44:25,700 --> 10:44:28,700
I was thinking about the in-game song. Oops.

11562
10:44:28,700 --> 10:44:30,700
My bad.

11563
10:44:30,700 --> 10:44:33,700
Where does- where does that go?

11564
10:44:33,700 --> 10:44:38,700
Easy come, easy go, little high, little low

11565
10:44:38,700 --> 10:44:44,700
Anyway the wind blows, it doesn't matter to me

11566
10:44:44,700 --> 10:44:49,700
I'm just a poor boy from a poor family, he's just a poor boy

11567
10:44:49,700 --> 10:44:53,700
Spare him his life from this monstrosity

11568
10:44:53,700 --> 10:44:56,700
Uh, how else does it go?

11569
10:44:56,700 --> 10:45:01,700
Galaleo, Galaleo, Galaleo, Galaleo, Galaleo

11570
10:45:01,700 --> 10:45:04,700
Oh no, no, no, let him go

11571
10:45:04,700 --> 10:45:06,700
Don't let him go

11572
10:45:06,700 --> 10:45:10,700
I can't remember how that freaking goes

11573
10:45:11,700 --> 10:45:15,700
What to unlock it so you can listen to it?

11574
10:45:15,700 --> 10:45:19,700
Though I finished these freaking swordfish before I fall asleep

11575
10:45:19,700 --> 10:45:23,700
I'm like so tired, my eyes are bulging out of their skull right now

11576
10:45:23,700 --> 10:45:26,700
I'm ready to snooze

11577
10:45:26,700 --> 10:45:29,700
Although I might level up actually, before I snooze

11578
10:45:29,700 --> 10:45:32,700
Best cover, let me go, we will not let you go

11579
10:45:32,700 --> 10:45:34,700
No, no, no, no, no

11580
10:45:34,700 --> 10:45:37,700
No, it's important, it's good

11581
10:45:38,700 --> 10:45:42,700
Best cover, oh yeah, did you enjoy that, me guessing all the lyrics of that entire thing

11582
10:45:42,700 --> 10:45:45,700
Cause I completely forgot how it works

11583
10:45:45,700 --> 10:45:47,700
That's like full level now

11584
10:45:47,700 --> 10:45:52,700
Wow, we're gonna be 78 by the end of this, feels good man

11585
10:45:52,700 --> 10:45:55,700
Feel good man

11586
10:45:59,700 --> 10:46:02,700
Oh excuse me for yelling

11587
10:46:02,700 --> 10:46:05,700
I'm so going to bed, oh my god

11588
10:46:08,700 --> 10:46:12,700
I'm just a perv, we fun, I need no sympathy

11589
10:46:16,700 --> 10:46:20,700
I'm just a perv, we fun, I need no sympathy

11590
10:46:23,700 --> 10:46:25,700
Wait what?

11591
10:46:25,700 --> 10:46:28,700
I wonder, I'm just a perv

11592
10:46:28,700 --> 10:46:33,700
Cause I have a mummy, mummy's losing the plot, that's what mummy's doing right now

11593
10:46:33,700 --> 10:46:39,700
I'm starting to get about H2O delirious up in here

11594
10:46:39,700 --> 10:46:45,700
There's a bird outside my window, the magpies are probably wondering why I haven't said them today

11595
10:46:49,700 --> 10:46:52,700
I can do it, I promise

11596
10:46:52,700 --> 10:46:55,700
I can do it, I can stay up, I'm totally not exhausted

11597
10:46:55,700 --> 10:46:57,700
But it's okay

11598
10:46:58,700 --> 10:47:01,700
I can make it happen

11599
10:47:01,700 --> 10:47:03,700
I can make it happen

11600
10:47:09,700 --> 10:47:11,700
Yay!

11601
10:47:11,700 --> 10:47:14,700
I didn't get any seratonin but I think it's cause I'm so tired

11602
10:47:14,700 --> 10:47:16,700
There's no seratonin left in my system

11603
10:47:16,700 --> 10:47:19,700
You don't have anything to burn on the fire, I do so

11604
10:47:19,700 --> 10:47:23,700
Level 78, let's go

11605
10:47:23,700 --> 10:47:26,700
Level 78

11606
10:47:26,700 --> 10:47:29,700
Well now I gotta adapt the learn

11607
10:47:29,700 --> 10:47:32,700
Yeah eventually seratonin only comes from netting it

11608
10:47:32,700 --> 10:47:35,700
Man this game was rigged from the start

11609
10:47:35,700 --> 10:47:38,700
Reach for the start

11610
10:47:39,700 --> 10:47:40,700
Yippee!

11611
10:47:40,700 --> 10:47:45,700
78, well I definitely blew over my guesstimate for what we would be on

11612
10:47:45,700 --> 10:47:50,700
But I'm still back at level 62

11613
10:47:50,700 --> 10:47:52,700
That's fine

11614
10:47:52,700 --> 10:47:57,700
Maybe Wayne cost a lot of money though, that's the only problem

11615
10:48:02,700 --> 10:48:05,700
Are we friends? I can do it

11616
10:48:05,700 --> 10:48:08,700
I can do it, you kid

11617
10:48:08,700 --> 10:48:13,700
I could also cook and not waste exp, she's passing out, oh yeah

11618
10:48:13,700 --> 10:48:18,700
Oh my god I'm actually, like this sleep is really starting to hit me

11619
10:48:18,700 --> 10:48:20,700
I don't even have my tea yet

11620
10:48:20,700 --> 10:48:23,700
Can you hear it, can you tell them?

11621
10:48:23,700 --> 10:48:26,700
Wah, KFP with another 10

11622
10:48:26,700 --> 10:48:29,700
Thank you, my goodness

11623
10:48:29,700 --> 10:48:32,700
Are you squidding me right now?

11624
10:48:32,700 --> 10:48:35,700
Are you squidding me right now?

11625
10:48:35,700 --> 10:48:39,700
Congrats to those who caught the membership with their faceballs

11626
10:48:39,700 --> 10:48:44,700
Oh I wasn't even cooking them swordfish, I'm getting so disheartened

11627
10:48:44,700 --> 10:48:47,700
I have my copper tea in my hand right now

11628
10:48:47,700 --> 10:48:50,700
I should probably go to sleep, I'm freaking ready to go

11629
10:48:50,700 --> 10:48:53,700
Are you squidding me right now?

11630
10:48:54,700 --> 10:48:57,700
Are you squidding me right now?

11631
10:48:58,700 --> 10:49:02,700
Are you squidding me right now?

11632
10:49:02,700 --> 10:49:05,700
Are you squidding me right now?

11633
10:49:18,700 --> 10:49:22,700
But she doesn't know if you're playing for another hour or not

11634
10:49:24,700 --> 10:49:30,700
If there's any wee snippets that want to be a deer and pass on a message from Mummy

11635
10:49:33,700 --> 10:49:36,700
A big bug

11636
10:49:36,700 --> 10:49:40,700
Zero grapes in Vorkuta

11637
10:49:40,700 --> 10:49:44,700
Oh wait, sorry that's the boat from Black Wolf

11638
10:49:44,700 --> 10:49:46,700
Didn't make it sad

11639
10:49:46,700 --> 10:49:49,700
What's your take on levelling up without OO, only to your level?

11640
10:49:49,700 --> 10:49:52,700
Oh no, you can level up all you want, it's perfectly fine too

11641
10:49:52,700 --> 10:49:56,700
For me personally, I'm not going to level up offline

11642
10:49:56,700 --> 10:50:00,700
Thank you again KFP Spidey for the gifted mumber

11643
10:50:00,700 --> 10:50:04,700
Okay, that was a big stagger

11644
10:50:04,700 --> 10:50:07,700
Star, I'm very tired

11645
10:50:07,700 --> 10:50:10,700
I will drink my tea now

11646
10:50:17,700 --> 10:50:23,700
The gifted membership was what I was supposed to say in English

11647
10:50:23,700 --> 10:50:26,700
The royal monkey

11648
10:50:26,700 --> 10:50:29,700
Cooking on top of the strony

11649
10:50:34,700 --> 10:50:37,700
Mercy said that she will lately still be live in an hour

11650
10:50:37,700 --> 10:50:41,700
Okay, thank you snippets for checking that out

11651
10:50:42,700 --> 10:50:44,700
I can do it

11652
10:50:44,700 --> 10:50:47,700
I can do it, 50 minutes

11653
10:50:47,700 --> 10:50:51,700
Oh Mummy can do it, Mummy's just very tired

11654
10:50:51,700 --> 10:50:53,700
Do your reflexes

11655
10:50:53,700 --> 10:50:57,700
I'm ready to pass out, oh my god my bed time's normally 5 o'clock

11656
10:50:57,700 --> 10:51:02,700
I've got 2 more hours until bedtime and I'm perishing

11657
10:51:02,700 --> 10:51:06,700
I don't want to end early though, the whole point is supposed to be the same

11658
10:51:07,700 --> 10:51:12,700
I don't want to end early though, the whole point is supposed to be endurance

11659
10:51:12,700 --> 10:51:16,700
Oh my god, this is like whacking me for the sake of my head

11660
10:51:19,700 --> 10:51:23,700
Normally I don't do

11661
10:51:23,700 --> 10:51:28,700
Oh my god, please cooperate

11662
10:51:28,700 --> 10:51:32,700
My brain's not cooperating, oh crap

11663
10:51:33,700 --> 10:51:38,700
Sleepy beepy mummy

11664
10:51:41,700 --> 10:51:47,700
Almost there, almost there, we just have to hold on and replay

11665
10:51:47,700 --> 10:51:52,700
Please hold on with me, hold, we can do it

11666
10:51:52,700 --> 10:51:58,700
We just have to cook these billions swordfish that we were kindly gifted replay

11667
10:52:02,700 --> 10:52:08,700
Strani, what's your feelings about a you start sleepy time when your girlfriend just happens to

11668
10:52:08,700 --> 10:52:13,700
See, on me, no, me doing that to you, absolutely

11669
10:52:15,700 --> 10:52:19,700
I will discuss more of that in the member stream, maybe

11670
10:52:19,700 --> 10:52:25,700
Hold the lane, hold the lane, I'm holding

11671
10:52:25,700 --> 10:52:27,700
Okay, so far so good

11672
10:52:27,700 --> 10:52:32,700
Old school runescape is heavy due to insurance game, only game to challenge Strani this much

11673
10:52:32,700 --> 10:52:35,700
Literally I'm like so tired out of nowhere

11674
10:52:35,700 --> 10:52:40,700
I was supposed to eat that food and I was supposed to freaking help me

11675
10:52:40,700 --> 10:52:45,700
Get more energised and I just want to roll up into a ball and pass out

11676
10:52:45,700 --> 10:52:51,700
I'm like sipping honey tea, it's got caffeine in it, it's going to do absolutely nothing for me

11677
10:52:52,700 --> 10:52:57,700
A sugar crash, did I eat? Would that take away half sugar in it?

11678
10:53:00,700 --> 10:53:02,700
You can sleep early

11679
10:53:04,700 --> 10:53:06,700
Someone got a clues girl

11680
10:53:09,700 --> 10:53:15,700
Oh, on me, on you, a true Strani classic

11681
10:53:15,700 --> 10:53:20,700
Honestly, I feel really bad, but like I want to do like all these things to you, Rieflin

11682
10:53:20,700 --> 10:53:24,700
But you doing it to me, I'm like, I'm too scared

11683
10:53:24,700 --> 10:53:28,700
Or like I'm not, that's not really doing much for me

11684
10:53:28,700 --> 10:53:31,700
But me doing it to you, eh

11685
10:53:34,700 --> 10:53:38,700
Like the terrible ones that you're not supposed to speak out loud

11686
10:53:38,700 --> 10:53:43,700
I've written on some kind of sugar

11687
10:53:43,700 --> 10:53:48,700
Oh, sugar, sugar, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum

11688
10:53:48,700 --> 10:53:52,700
Oh, honey, honey, mm, mm, mm, mm, mm

11689
10:53:52,700 --> 10:53:57,700
You ask my candy Rieflin

11690
10:53:57,700 --> 10:54:02,700
And you've got me, mm, mm, mm

11691
10:54:02,700 --> 10:54:05,700
Our bodies are ready, please

11692
10:54:05,700 --> 10:54:08,700
Always happy to be your guinea pig

11693
10:54:08,700 --> 10:54:11,700
No, it's good, I love that

11694
10:54:11,700 --> 10:54:16,700
No, I'll be fine, I promise, I'm fine, I'm fine, I can do it

11695
10:54:16,700 --> 10:54:21,700
Endurance, endurance, endurance, I will make sure I'm redirecting Mercy in this next batch

11696
10:54:21,700 --> 10:54:24,700
Because it's not going to work out

11697
10:54:26,700 --> 10:54:32,700
I'm feeling kind of tired, but I'm going to stick it out through until you get off

11698
10:54:32,700 --> 10:54:35,700
I'm getting off right now, I'm ovulating

11699
10:54:35,700 --> 10:54:40,700
Oh, no, my filter is going, I'm sorry, I shouldn't be saying that stuff

11700
10:54:40,700 --> 10:54:44,700
I'm sorry, I shouldn't be saying that stuff

11701
10:54:44,700 --> 10:54:47,700
Hold on, let me wake the frick up, let me wake up

11702
10:54:47,700 --> 10:54:53,700
Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up

11703
10:54:53,700 --> 10:54:55,700
Grab a little makeup

11704
10:54:55,700 --> 10:55:00,700
Put the keys upon the table, something, something else, it's like a fable

11705
10:55:00,700 --> 10:55:02,700
Let's get Mercy's

11706
10:55:03,700 --> 10:55:06,700
Livestream, Old Skilled Rinskate

11707
10:55:06,700 --> 10:55:09,700
Customization, Direct

11708
10:55:09,700 --> 10:55:14,700
And it should have picked Mercy

11709
10:55:14,700 --> 10:55:18,700
Should have picked any kind of support

11710
10:55:18,700 --> 10:55:23,700
I'm sorry for saying that out loud

11711
10:55:23,700 --> 10:55:25,700
Mommy's getting tired

11712
10:55:26,700 --> 10:55:30,700
System of a Down Reference, yeah, chops away

11713
10:55:38,700 --> 10:55:41,700
She makes a lot of random base references

11714
10:55:41,700 --> 10:55:43,700
Should have gotten a Scotland Fender with

11715
10:55:45,700 --> 10:55:49,700
In your 20s, are you an OG-san?

11716
10:55:50,700 --> 10:55:55,700
There you make sure you're an OG-san, surely

11717
10:55:55,700 --> 10:55:57,700
Surely

11718
10:56:01,700 --> 10:56:04,700
You should stream more when you're both tired, and I'll be like

11719
10:56:04,700 --> 10:56:07,700
Sorry, I don't know if you know

11720
10:56:07,700 --> 10:56:09,700
I don't remember that till day they do it

11721
10:56:09,700 --> 10:56:11,700
Who does it?

11722
10:56:12,700 --> 10:56:14,700
The day who does what?

11723
10:56:15,700 --> 10:56:17,700
What does that mean?

11724
10:56:17,700 --> 10:56:19,700
What does that mean?

11725
10:56:20,700 --> 10:56:22,700
But the game ends up going offline

11726
10:56:22,700 --> 10:56:25,700
Oh, like the game updates for patches

11727
10:56:25,700 --> 10:56:27,700
Yeah, there he tags that, there he won

11728
10:56:27,700 --> 10:56:30,700
So on death's door, no!

11729
10:56:30,700 --> 10:56:33,700
Witchy-sans are supposed to be fairies

11730
10:56:34,700 --> 10:56:38,700
I don't know, we ended up being...

11731
10:56:38,700 --> 10:56:43,700
It's all in four, your tears are what I live for

11732
10:56:44,700 --> 10:56:49,700
Cause you should have picked Mercy

11733
10:56:50,700 --> 10:56:55,700
Should have picked any kind of girl of your...

11734
10:56:56,700 --> 10:56:58,700
Yeah, my tummy!

11735
10:56:58,700 --> 10:57:00,700
I don't know if you can hear those internal farts

11736
10:57:00,700 --> 10:57:02,700
But if you can hear the internal farts

11737
10:57:02,700 --> 10:57:04,700
I'm sorry, I had to be this way

11738
10:57:07,700 --> 10:57:09,700
Didn't I see this stream this morning?

11739
10:57:09,700 --> 10:57:11,700
Kinda was, yeah, yeah, you did

11740
10:57:11,700 --> 10:57:12,700
I'm a wee bit addicted

11741
10:57:12,700 --> 10:57:14,700
I'm starting to lose the plot though

11742
10:57:14,700 --> 10:57:18,700
So you're welcome to watch my Descent Into Madness

11743
10:57:18,700 --> 10:57:20,700
My filter is also gone

11744
10:57:20,700 --> 10:57:24,700
Because I'm starting to see things I know I'm not supposed to see

11745
10:57:24,700 --> 10:57:27,700
They're kinda just coming out, just like your ink, you know?

11746
10:57:29,700 --> 10:57:30,700
Only so much I can do

11747
10:57:30,700 --> 10:57:33,700
We're actually gonna get less than a thousand sorbys

11748
10:57:35,700 --> 10:57:37,700
Internal farts? No, they are internal farts

11749
10:57:37,700 --> 10:57:39,700
Well at least something's digested

11750
10:57:40,700 --> 10:57:43,700
But this must mean I'm discussing

11751
10:57:45,700 --> 10:57:47,700
To make myself wealthy

11752
10:57:47,700 --> 10:57:50,700
She's slowly dying from my innocence

11753
10:57:55,700 --> 10:57:58,700
I came in at work quite tired and feisty

11754
10:57:58,700 --> 10:58:01,700
Wrote an entire world domination agenda on my calendar

11755
10:58:01,700 --> 10:58:05,700
Are we done it? Are we taking down the big companies?

11756
10:58:06,700 --> 10:58:10,700
Eleven hour grind set, interest of thoughts are in taking the wheel

11757
10:58:11,700 --> 10:58:13,700
Take the wheel

11758
10:58:15,700 --> 10:58:17,700
Man, really?

11759
10:58:17,700 --> 10:58:19,700
Oh, I completely started to do that

11760
10:58:19,700 --> 10:58:21,700
Man, RuneScape is really...

11761
10:58:21,700 --> 10:58:22,700
OG

11762
10:58:22,700 --> 10:58:24,700
Yes, old school RuneScape

11763
10:58:24,700 --> 10:58:27,700
RuneScape 3, which is the new one, I think

11764
10:58:27,700 --> 10:58:30,700
Not really played that at all

11765
10:58:30,700 --> 10:58:32,700
I didn't actually understand

11766
10:58:33,700 --> 10:58:35,700
When it came out, there was two different games

11767
10:58:35,700 --> 10:58:38,700
And I think I actually ended up playing RuneScape 3

11768
10:58:38,700 --> 10:58:40,700
For a little bit like a dummy

11769
10:58:40,700 --> 10:58:42,700
Because I was like, why is the game so different?

11770
10:58:42,700 --> 10:58:44,700
Why did they do that?

11771
10:58:45,700 --> 10:58:47,700
Or was it they made RuneScape 3

11772
10:58:47,700 --> 10:58:49,700
And then everyone was like, ooh, go back

11773
10:58:49,700 --> 10:58:52,700
And then they were like, okay, there's now two games

11774
10:58:54,700 --> 10:58:56,700
These are the golden hours

11775
10:58:56,700 --> 10:58:57,700
So this is the last bit

11776
10:58:57,700 --> 10:59:00,700
Uh, not quite, we've still got...

11777
10:59:03,700 --> 10:59:05,700
50 minutes, I could have sworn it said 50 minutes

11778
10:59:05,700 --> 10:59:07,700
50 minutes ago, but...

11779
10:59:07,700 --> 10:59:08,700
There's three?

11780
10:59:08,700 --> 10:59:10,700
I thought there was like RuneScape 3

11781
10:59:10,700 --> 10:59:13,700
Wasn't the new RuneScape called RuneScape 3?

11782
10:59:13,700 --> 10:59:15,700
It's really OG-san

11783
10:59:17,700 --> 10:59:19,700
Get it? Cause that's how I say OG

11784
10:59:20,700 --> 10:59:23,700
RuneScape 3 is the original server from that

11785
10:59:23,700 --> 10:59:25,700
Old-school RuneScape is them

11786
10:59:25,700 --> 10:59:27,700
We put in the old game back

11787
10:59:27,700 --> 10:59:29,700
Oh, okay

11788
10:59:29,700 --> 10:59:32,700
Cause they did a World of Warcraft do that as well

11789
10:59:32,700 --> 10:59:35,700
There's like an old world warcraft

11790
10:59:35,700 --> 10:59:36,700
Oh my god

11791
10:59:36,700 --> 10:59:41,700
My tongue is not even following what I'm telling it to do

11792
10:59:41,700 --> 10:59:42,700
Wah!

11793
10:59:46,700 --> 10:59:48,700
You said three batches before, this is a lot...

11794
10:59:48,700 --> 10:59:50,700
No, come on

11795
10:59:53,700 --> 10:59:56,700
Oh, almost just knocked over my cola everywhere

11796
10:59:57,700 --> 10:59:59,700
I really should clean this up

11797
10:59:59,700 --> 11:00:01,700
But what happens if I feel not...

11798
11:00:01,700 --> 11:00:03,700
Stop opening up the collection

11799
11:00:03,700 --> 11:00:05,700
And stop eating the swordfish

11800
11:00:05,700 --> 11:00:07,700
We're gonna sell that, we need that money

11801
11:00:07,700 --> 11:00:09,700
Okay, we're at 900 now

11802
11:00:10,700 --> 11:00:11,700
Wah

11803
11:00:14,700 --> 11:00:15,700
Wah

11804
11:00:15,700 --> 11:00:17,700
How big is an inventory?

11805
11:00:17,700 --> 11:00:22,700
4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28

11806
11:00:22,700 --> 11:00:23,700
Okay

11807
11:00:23,700 --> 11:00:26,700
By the 28, that's like...

11808
11:00:26,700 --> 11:00:29,700
4 for every 100

11809
11:00:34,700 --> 11:00:36,700
Refling on time

11810
11:00:42,700 --> 11:00:44,700
Play both just...

11811
11:00:44,700 --> 11:00:46,700
Wait, what did you say?

11812
11:00:46,700 --> 11:00:47,700
Just play both

11813
11:00:47,700 --> 11:00:50,700
It's not like this game is grindy or anything

11814
11:00:50,700 --> 11:00:52,700
Are you gonna disappoint us or not?

11815
11:00:52,700 --> 11:00:55,700
No, I'm not gonna disappoint and I'm freaking doing it

11816
11:00:55,700 --> 11:00:57,700
I'm freaking...

11817
11:00:57,700 --> 11:00:59,700
I'm cooking the swordfish

11818
11:00:59,700 --> 11:01:04,700
I'm cooking my ancestors and my cousins and stuff

11819
11:01:04,700 --> 11:01:06,700
Cause get it? Cause I'm a cultfish?

11820
11:01:10,700 --> 11:01:12,700
Are you refling?

11821
11:01:12,700 --> 11:01:15,700
You're requesting us to go open it

11822
11:01:15,700 --> 11:01:16,700
Wah!

11823
11:01:18,700 --> 11:01:20,700
Are you refling?

11824
11:01:21,700 --> 11:01:24,700
Are you even losing that ability to read right now?

11825
11:01:24,700 --> 11:01:26,700
I don't think you said that

11826
11:01:26,700 --> 11:01:28,700
Holy crap

11827
11:01:28,700 --> 11:01:31,700
As you're refling, you're requesting me to go open it

11828
11:01:31,700 --> 11:01:33,700
Okay, that looks more like English

11829
11:01:33,700 --> 11:01:36,700
Go to sleep... No, you go to sleep

11830
11:01:36,700 --> 11:01:38,700
Go to sleep when...

11831
11:01:40,700 --> 11:01:42,700
When something happens

11832
11:01:42,700 --> 11:01:44,700
Go

11833
11:01:48,700 --> 11:01:50,700
I'm gonna... I can do endurance stream

11834
11:01:50,700 --> 11:01:52,700
Literally, I don't want to lose my endurance title

11835
11:01:52,700 --> 11:01:55,700
Like 2 cent meters of playing the game

11836
11:01:55,700 --> 11:01:57,700
Wah

11837
11:01:58,700 --> 11:02:01,700
I'll only go to sleep if you come with me

11838
11:02:01,700 --> 11:02:03,700
Come with me

11839
11:02:03,700 --> 11:02:06,700
Oh no, it's the wrong one, it's that Japanese song

11840
11:02:06,700 --> 11:02:08,700
Stay with me

11841
11:02:13,700 --> 11:02:16,700
Ta-da-da-da-da

11842
11:02:16,700 --> 11:02:18,700
I don't know how the rest of it goes

11843
11:02:21,700 --> 11:02:24,700
I'll only sleep if you decide to sleep as well

11844
11:02:24,700 --> 11:02:26,700
Yeah

11845
11:02:26,700 --> 11:02:28,700
Self-hypnotism by exhaustion

11846
11:02:28,700 --> 11:02:30,700
This is working apparently

11847
11:02:30,700 --> 11:02:32,700
No

11848
11:02:32,700 --> 11:02:35,700
You've been streaming for 11 hours

11849
11:02:35,700 --> 11:02:38,700
Nobody's taking your endurance stream title from you

11850
11:02:39,700 --> 11:02:44,700
I'm just gonna eat this little cheeky

11851
11:02:44,700 --> 11:02:47,700
Cheeky swordfish on a Sunday afternoon

11852
11:02:47,700 --> 11:02:49,700
I don't even know what day of the week is

11853
11:02:49,700 --> 11:02:51,700
You know what day of the week is?

11854
11:02:51,700 --> 11:02:53,700
Stream day

11855
11:02:53,700 --> 11:02:56,700
I like it, it'll be more and more weekly

11856
11:03:00,700 --> 11:03:02,700
Imagine if I could swim

11857
11:03:02,700 --> 11:03:04,700
Oh

11858
11:03:06,700 --> 11:03:08,700
Then for that time I got hired to sing

11859
11:03:10,700 --> 11:03:13,700
Right, stop it, that's naughty

11860
11:03:14,700 --> 11:03:16,700
That's naughty

11861
11:03:16,700 --> 11:03:18,700
Okay, we're almost finished with the swordfish

11862
11:03:21,700 --> 11:03:27,700
You're beginning to feel very, very sleepy

11863
11:03:27,700 --> 11:03:31,700
Why are you talking like a vampire

11864
11:03:33,700 --> 11:03:35,700
Hmm

11865
11:03:36,700 --> 11:03:38,700
Stay with me

11866
11:03:47,700 --> 11:03:49,700
What are they even talking about, honestly?

11867
11:03:49,700 --> 11:03:52,700
I feel like I'm eavesdropping to see what they're talking about

11868
11:03:52,700 --> 11:03:54,700
I'll wait for their new message to pop up

11869
11:03:54,700 --> 11:03:58,700
And I'll start commenting on what the rooflings are talking about to each other

11870
11:03:58,700 --> 11:04:01,700
They'll never expect it

11871
11:04:01,700 --> 11:04:04,700
Oh, for goodness sake, I don't know how to keep them up

11872
11:04:07,700 --> 11:04:09,700
Boom, boom, look at that name

11873
11:04:09,700 --> 11:04:11,700
They're teak, no

11874
11:04:11,700 --> 11:04:13,700
Please leave it alone

11875
11:04:14,700 --> 11:04:16,700
She collected again

11876
11:04:16,700 --> 11:04:18,700
Oh, I'm not late to collect

11877
11:04:19,700 --> 11:04:21,700
It's because I'm a waman

11878
11:04:21,700 --> 11:04:23,700
My mistakes is I'm even in runescape

11879
11:04:23,700 --> 11:04:25,700
I'm sorry, that's not nice

11880
11:04:25,700 --> 11:04:28,700
You can just play the waman card whenever you want

11881
11:04:28,700 --> 11:04:30,700
That's kind of funny though

11882
11:04:32,700 --> 11:04:40,700
I don't know why you're right-clicking at

11883
11:04:40,700 --> 11:04:42,700
I don't know, maybe I'll right-click you

11884
11:04:42,700 --> 11:04:44,700
What are you gonna do about that?

11885
11:04:44,700 --> 11:04:46,700
Right-click is funny enough

11886
11:04:49,700 --> 11:04:51,700
Collect your ink

11887
11:04:52,700 --> 11:04:55,700
Look into the mirror, you're not giving

11888
11:04:55,700 --> 11:04:58,700
We're talking about time-spanning games

11889
11:04:58,700 --> 11:05:01,700
Is your rune-crafting world still up?

11890
11:05:01,700 --> 11:05:03,700
I remember the old rune-crafting

11891
11:05:03,700 --> 11:05:05,700
I don't know what that means

11892
11:05:05,700 --> 11:05:07,700
But thank you for your question

11893
11:05:07,700 --> 11:05:09,700
The answer is probably no, smile

11894
11:05:09,700 --> 11:05:12,700
I don't know anything about runescape

11895
11:05:12,700 --> 11:05:14,700
Good night, scrawny and everyone

11896
11:05:14,700 --> 11:05:16,700
I'm going to sleep

11897
11:05:16,700 --> 11:05:18,700
Rest well

11898
11:05:18,700 --> 11:05:20,700
Go

11899
11:05:20,700 --> 11:05:22,700
Twinkle, twinkle

11900
11:05:22,700 --> 11:05:24,700
Look for

11901
11:05:24,700 --> 11:05:26,700
How I wonder

11902
11:05:26,700 --> 11:05:28,700
What you are

11903
11:05:28,700 --> 11:05:32,700
Up above the world so high

11904
11:05:32,700 --> 11:05:36,700
Like a diamond in the sky

11905
11:05:36,700 --> 11:05:38,700
Twinkle, twinkle

11906
11:05:38,700 --> 11:05:41,700
I swear if anyone puts anything under 18

11907
11:05:41,700 --> 11:05:43,700
To that question, you're all done

11908
11:05:50,700 --> 11:05:53,700
Okay, we've got 45 minutes or something like that

11909
11:05:53,700 --> 11:05:55,700
Oh no, now we've got 50

11910
11:05:55,700 --> 11:05:57,700
No, we've got less than 50 minutes

11911
11:05:57,700 --> 11:05:59,700
We've got 49 minutes

11912
11:05:59,700 --> 11:06:01,700
Because the board breaks all of them

11913
11:06:12,700 --> 11:06:16,700
Should I write the girl's marrows as a prank?

11914
11:06:16,700 --> 11:06:18,700
We could do that

11915
11:06:19,700 --> 11:06:23,700
You pretend to not be me and write the girl's marrows

11916
11:06:23,700 --> 11:06:26,700
And say the most terrible stuff in there

11917
11:06:34,700 --> 11:06:36,700
Do it, do an extremely spicy one

11918
11:06:36,700 --> 11:06:39,700
Okay, who should we do for us?

11919
11:06:39,700 --> 11:06:41,700
Mods, can I give you permission to speak

11920
11:06:41,700 --> 11:06:43,700
So you give me the girl's links and I'll write some stuff

11921
11:06:43,700 --> 11:06:45,700
And then I'll wash my hands as I should

11922
11:06:54,700 --> 11:06:56,700
And

11923
11:06:58,700 --> 11:07:01,700
So I only mentioned things that only you would know

11924
11:07:01,700 --> 11:07:03,700
The girls aren't gonna know who we're doing

11925
11:07:03,700 --> 11:07:05,700
Azura, oh my god, okay

11926
11:07:05,700 --> 11:07:07,700
Let's go to Azura

11927
11:07:11,700 --> 11:07:15,700
Big, juicy, choco knockers

11928
11:07:17,700 --> 11:07:19,700
You are so beautiful

11929
11:07:19,700 --> 11:07:22,700
Your voice is so beautiful

11930
11:07:22,700 --> 11:07:25,700
Your personality so beautiful

11931
11:07:25,700 --> 11:07:28,700
Beautiful

11932
11:07:28,700 --> 11:07:34,700
You are a blessing upon my life and yet

11933
11:07:34,700 --> 11:07:39,700
You are the goddess who gives blessings

11934
11:07:39,700 --> 11:07:42,700
But I am already blessed

11935
11:07:42,700 --> 11:07:48,700
You didn't have to give me, you didn't have to give me the blessing

11936
11:07:48,700 --> 11:07:50,700
God, I love you

11937
11:07:50,700 --> 11:07:52,700
Chocolate milkers

11938
11:07:52,700 --> 11:07:54,700
Good night, Azura

11939
11:07:54,700 --> 11:07:56,700
You are loved

11940
11:07:56,700 --> 11:07:58,700
Okay, that's Azura done

11941
11:08:00,700 --> 11:08:02,700
I'd like to keep my message private

11942
11:08:02,700 --> 11:08:04,700
Yes, sent

11943
11:08:06,700 --> 11:08:08,700
Yes, okay, sent

11944
11:08:08,700 --> 11:08:10,700
We have done Azura

11945
11:08:12,700 --> 11:08:14,700
You'll never know it's me

11946
11:08:15,700 --> 11:08:19,700
More swordfish, I demand more swordfish

11947
11:08:19,700 --> 11:08:21,700
Give me swordfish

11948
11:08:21,700 --> 11:08:23,700
Okay, done Azura

11949
11:08:23,700 --> 11:08:25,700
Who next?

11950
11:08:25,700 --> 11:08:27,700
AC

11951
11:08:29,700 --> 11:08:32,700
Go to, no, open up AC

11952
11:08:32,700 --> 11:08:34,700
Go to say

11953
11:08:35,700 --> 11:08:37,700
Okay, I'm stressed

11954
11:08:37,700 --> 11:08:40,700
Wait, oh, where did you go?

11955
11:08:41,700 --> 11:08:44,700
You're so tiny and cute

11956
11:08:45,700 --> 11:08:48,700
Oh my god, I'm going to be an OG-san

11957
11:08:48,700 --> 11:08:52,700
I'm a self-identified OG-san

11958
11:08:52,700 --> 11:08:56,700
And my god, you're so tiny

11959
11:08:56,700 --> 11:09:00,700
I want to care for you forever

11960
11:09:00,700 --> 11:09:06,700
I want to do what I can to make you happy, little cub

11961
11:09:07,700 --> 11:09:11,700
I love that you call yourself cub

11962
11:09:11,700 --> 11:09:14,700
It's too adorable

11963
11:09:14,700 --> 11:09:19,700
My old man, OG-san, heart can't take it

11964
11:09:19,700 --> 11:09:23,700
As long as you're happy

11965
11:09:23,700 --> 11:09:26,700
I am happy, little cub

11966
11:09:27,700 --> 11:09:36,700
Let me make you happy with my OG-san

11967
11:09:36,700 --> 11:09:38,700
Oh, no, you can't say that

11968
11:09:38,700 --> 11:09:43,700
Let me make you happy with OG-san's body

11969
11:09:43,700 --> 11:09:45,700
OG-san's body

11970
11:09:45,700 --> 11:09:47,700
Okay, there we go, send

11971
11:09:50,700 --> 11:09:52,700
Okay, more swordfish

11972
11:09:53,700 --> 11:09:56,700
Who's next?

11973
11:10:00,700 --> 11:10:03,700
I'd like to burn the swordfish, please

11974
11:10:03,700 --> 11:10:04,700
Who's next?

11975
11:10:04,700 --> 11:10:07,700
Emi, oh, where'd I even begin?

11976
11:10:10,700 --> 11:10:13,700
I wish for you to perish me

11977
11:10:14,700 --> 11:10:19,700
Then laugh in my face as you raise me

11978
11:10:19,700 --> 11:10:23,700
Back and forth with your, with your what?

11979
11:10:23,700 --> 11:10:27,700
With your, your powers, your powers?

11980
11:10:27,700 --> 11:10:30,700
With your powers

11981
11:10:30,700 --> 11:10:34,700
I want to be humiliated

11982
11:10:34,700 --> 11:10:35,700
Oh god, she's going to notice me

11983
11:10:35,700 --> 11:10:37,700
Because I can't spell humiliated

11984
11:10:37,700 --> 11:10:41,700
I want to be humiliated by you over and over

11985
11:10:41,700 --> 11:10:44,700
I want to see that

11986
11:10:45,700 --> 11:10:50,700
Shit, shit, eaten, grin

11987
11:10:50,700 --> 11:10:57,700
As I disappoint you and take any punishment you deserve

11988
11:10:57,700 --> 11:11:00,700
I love you, holsys

11989
11:11:05,700 --> 11:11:06,700
Like three?

11990
11:11:06,700 --> 11:11:07,700
Yeah, three

11991
11:11:07,700 --> 11:11:10,700
I need to send one to myself

11992
11:11:10,700 --> 11:11:13,700
I need to send one to myself

11993
11:11:17,700 --> 11:11:19,700
Where is that?

11994
11:11:19,700 --> 11:11:21,700
We've got mercy

11995
11:11:23,700 --> 11:11:25,700
Okay, I'll go, go to site

11996
11:11:29,700 --> 11:11:33,700
I can't wait for the day you break in

11997
11:11:33,700 --> 11:11:39,700
and catch me watching another VTuber

11998
11:11:39,700 --> 11:11:41,700
that isn't you

11999
11:11:41,700 --> 11:11:44,700
It's one big mistake, of course

12000
11:11:44,700 --> 11:11:49,700
but you can't help but become feral

12001
11:11:49,700 --> 11:11:52,700
at the switch of a button

12002
11:11:52,700 --> 11:11:55,700
No, you can't help but become feral at the site

12003
11:11:55,700 --> 11:11:58,700
and completely enraged

12004
11:11:58,700 --> 11:12:04,700
before you know it, we're, we're dancing

12005
11:12:05,700 --> 11:12:10,700
Before you know it, we're, we're, well

12006
11:12:10,700 --> 11:12:14,700
I don't have clothes, I don't have clothes

12007
11:12:14,700 --> 11:12:19,700
clothes on in this scenario

12008
11:12:19,700 --> 11:12:24,700
but you claim me as yours

12009
11:12:24,700 --> 11:12:32,700
and it went and we both had a good time

12010
11:12:32,700 --> 11:12:34,700
Thank you

12011
11:12:34,700 --> 11:12:38,700
I don't even think that's English

12012
11:12:38,700 --> 11:12:40,700
Okay, we're almost done

12013
11:12:40,700 --> 11:12:43,700
Okay, surface, a little more surface

12014
11:12:43,700 --> 11:12:45,700
Okay, one more

12015
11:12:45,700 --> 11:12:47,700
Shibi

12016
11:12:47,700 --> 11:12:50,700
Shibi, shibi, shibi, shibi

12017
11:12:59,700 --> 11:13:01,700
Alright, Shibi

12018
11:13:02,700 --> 11:13:04,700
Um

12019
11:13:06,700 --> 11:13:08,700
Uh

12020
11:13:10,700 --> 11:13:12,700
Well, I was going to be saying

12021
11:13:12,700 --> 11:13:14,700
I'm going to bed because

12022
11:13:14,700 --> 11:13:16,700
I'm so tired

12023
11:13:16,700 --> 11:13:19,700
Shibi, shibi

12024
11:13:19,700 --> 11:13:21,700
Mm

12025
11:13:23,700 --> 11:13:25,700
Mm-hmm

12026
11:13:27,700 --> 11:13:29,700
Shibi

12027
11:13:30,700 --> 11:13:32,700
Shibi's a bunny rabbit

12028
11:13:32,700 --> 11:13:34,700
Mm

12029
11:13:35,700 --> 11:13:37,700
Mm-hmm

12030
11:13:41,700 --> 11:13:43,700
Oh

12031
11:13:44,700 --> 11:13:46,700
Mm-hmm

12032
11:13:54,700 --> 11:13:56,700
Okay, we're done

12033
11:13:56,700 --> 11:13:58,700
I can't do it anymore

12034
11:14:00,700 --> 11:14:01,700
We're done

12035
11:14:01,700 --> 11:14:04,700
I thought I got a good sleep

12036
11:14:04,700 --> 11:14:07,700
I think I'm done refling

12037
11:14:07,700 --> 11:14:10,700
I can't take any more

12038
11:14:10,700 --> 11:14:13,700
You've outstaminated me refling

12039
11:14:13,700 --> 11:14:15,700
I think I'm done

12040
11:14:15,700 --> 11:14:18,700
I can't last any longer

12041
11:14:18,700 --> 11:14:20,700
I'm sorry

12042
11:14:20,700 --> 11:14:23,700
Will you forgive me for going to bed?

12043
11:14:26,700 --> 11:14:29,700
I need to sleep a little bit more

12044
11:14:29,700 --> 11:14:31,700
You've done enough surface maths

12045
11:14:31,700 --> 11:14:32,700
and go to sleep

12046
11:14:32,700 --> 11:14:34,700
I'm going to be like that for you

12047
11:14:34,700 --> 11:14:36,700
Okay, refling

12048
11:14:36,700 --> 11:14:39,700
I'm going to

12049
11:14:39,700 --> 11:14:42,700
I'm going to go

12050
11:14:42,700 --> 11:14:44,700
and sleep

12051
11:14:45,700 --> 11:14:47,700
Um

12052
11:14:49,700 --> 11:14:52,700
Thank you very much for hanging out with me

12053
11:14:54,700 --> 11:14:56,700
You've been a good, giant-ass Uji-san

12054
11:14:56,700 --> 11:14:59,700
that made lots of cake or whatever

12055
11:15:00,700 --> 11:15:02,700
Good night, refling

12056
11:15:02,700 --> 11:15:05,700
I'll see you tomorrow when I wake up

12057
11:15:05,700 --> 11:15:08,700
once in a while

12058
11:15:08,700 --> 11:15:09,700
Good night

12059
11:15:09,700 --> 11:15:10,700
I'll dream

12060
11:15:10,700 --> 11:15:12,700
I'll dream of us on the farm

12061
11:15:12,700 --> 11:15:14,700
playing Connect 4

12062
11:15:14,700 --> 11:15:15,700
and then I reach

12063
11:15:15,700 --> 11:15:17,700
because I'm so bad at it

12064
11:15:19,700 --> 11:15:21,700
Bye, refling

12065
11:15:21,700 --> 11:15:24,700
See you at the mercy

12066
11:15:24,700 --> 11:15:26,700
Okay

12067
11:15:26,700 --> 11:15:28,700
I'm going to go to sleep

12068
11:15:28,700 --> 11:15:30,700
Love you, refling

12069
11:15:30,700 --> 11:15:32,700
I'll see you tomorrow

12070
11:15:32,700 --> 11:15:34,700
Bye

12071
11:15:34,700 --> 11:15:36,700
Go see

12072
11:15:36,700 --> 11:15:40,700
Say hi to mercy

12073
11:15:40,700 --> 11:15:43,700
Yes, mercy modis

12074
11:15:43,700 --> 11:15:46,700
Goodbye, mercy

12075
11:15:46,700 --> 11:15:47,700
Good night

12076
11:15:47,700 --> 11:15:48,700
Bye, refling

12077
11:15:48,700 --> 11:15:50,700
Love you, muah

12078
11:15:50,700 --> 11:15:51,700
What?

12079
11:15:51,700 --> 11:15:52,700
Yes

12080
11:15:52,700 --> 11:15:54,700
Mercy time
