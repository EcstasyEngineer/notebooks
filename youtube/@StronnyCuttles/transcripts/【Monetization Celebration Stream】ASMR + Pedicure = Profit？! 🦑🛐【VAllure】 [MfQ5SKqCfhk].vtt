07:03.580 --> 07:05.260
Hold on, hold on, I can do this

07:05.980 --> 07:14.780
I'm actually having a problem with this tool, by the way, I don't know what the lady did, but I think it's contracted and I might have to go with the doctor about it

07:15.180 --> 07:19.660
Cause something's not right, um, I cleaned the wound today

07:20.780 --> 07:24.620
And something's definitely not right, but I can't even get it to bloop

07:26.380 --> 07:27.180
Oh wait, hold on

07:29.660 --> 07:32.220
It's not blooping, I can't

07:33.180 --> 07:37.340
It's a crazy amount of team effort to get this to bloop, hold on

07:38.300 --> 07:42.940
Oh, come on, I'm just not turning over because of the way my feet are

07:46.460 --> 07:48.460

07:49.900 --> 07:51.980
Oh my, the little tool just cracked

Oh shit, I'm okay, I'm sorry, let me give my design a name

07:58.780 --> 08:05.740
That took me so long, I also brought Pop Rocks to proof how sweaty my feet are, I want to see if my feet sweat can make them pop

08:05.740 --> 08:07.740
Although just the feet sweat, nothing else

08:08.300 --> 08:12.380
I just realized I'm really covering that up, so I'm gonna go over here

08:13.020 --> 08:15.020
I don't know, look, it's my feet

08:15.580 --> 08:18.060
Oh yeah, I also have a PC cleaner

08:18.780 --> 08:25.660
These are used for fan board type things, but you need to like, squeeze them to get the air out

08:29.020 --> 08:33.500
So yeah, I brought a lot of tools to try and get rid of my freaking feet

08:34.620 --> 08:38.060
But I also got the frog thing, and it goes like

08:38.060 --> 08:40.060
Like

08:50.140 --> 08:52.380
Yeah, it's into the frog

08:53.740 --> 08:55.740
Hey, I'm working that one, hold on

08:56.780 --> 09:03.820
Okay, I'll try and say more names. I'm so sorry. I I'm very flustered when it comes to these kinds of streams

09:04.380 --> 09:06.380
I feel a little pressured like

09:08.460 --> 09:13.100
Oh yeah, listen to that frog. How are you so good with your feet? I don't know, how are you not so good with your feet?

09:17.100 --> 09:19.100
I'm trying not to knock over the webcam

09:23.100 --> 09:25.580
We'll do this, we'll try and say some names, okay

It's freaking impossible to keep up with but I'm gonna try my best, doesn't mean I can't try

10:06.780 --> 10:12.700
Okay, I'm gonna try and keep up. Please bear with me. AC's in the room, bear with me. Okay

10:13.900 --> 10:15.900
Could you wet? What?

10:17.260 --> 10:21.820
Could you? Man, I wish I had little feet. Could you wet feet drying my?

10:23.500 --> 10:28.140
Well, I bought pop rocks to see if I can actually get them to pop with my feet sweat alone, which is pretty gross

10:28.220 --> 10:30.220
But I thought it was really funny. Um

10:31.260 --> 10:33.260
Right, let me check where

Oh my god George, it's so hard for me

11:43.660 --> 11:45.660
Are you getting ASMR at least?

11:47.580 --> 11:53.420
Congrats on monetization. Thank you so much. I'm so sorry. I'm like really out of my element with these kind of streams

11:53.980 --> 11:55.980
I'm not used to like

11:56.140 --> 11:58.140
I don't know. I'm just used to

11:59.100 --> 12:04.780
Hopefully I can at least do some actual ASMR movement. I'm so sorry. I'm trying to catch up for a little

12:06.300 --> 12:08.300
Uh, Takiwo

12:57.980 --> 12:59.980
Thank you so much for everyone who is

13:00.540 --> 13:06.700
Becoming a member and being so fantastic. I'm completely out of my element. I do apologize, but

13:07.340 --> 13:09.340
Yeah, you like that

13:09.660 --> 13:11.660
Was in your ear

13:12.140 --> 13:15.660
But thank you so much for your support. You did it. Can you please scare him like that?

13:15.740 --> 13:18.300
I was gonna do a fake cam on buckshot really

13:18.860 --> 13:23.420
I don't know if I have to go to a doctor about my toe because something is wrong with it and I'm not

13:23.500 --> 13:25.500
I don't know what on earth is going on

13:25.740 --> 13:28.300
Oh, she did so on this toe

13:29.340 --> 13:34.620
This bit here she cut into like really deep and I was like, oh no, it's fine

13:35.100 --> 13:39.100
Like accidents happen. It was a little bit painful, but I didn't think anything of it

13:39.660 --> 13:43.420
And then it's actually pretty sore today. So I don't know if I have to get it checked out

13:44.300 --> 13:45.900
But yeah

13:45.900 --> 13:52.380
The only good thing with your toe is it's not the only thing wrong with your toes. It's not my max. Oh my goodness. Okay

13:55.980 --> 13:57.420
Oh

13:57.420 --> 14:01.020
Scrumptious nightmare. Thank you for all this dino. Thank you

14:01.500 --> 14:03.020
Grandpa thank you for coming to me

14:04.060 --> 14:08.540
Yes, you're not supposed to cut it at all. A lot of shops do it anyway. Yeah

14:09.740 --> 14:14.700
I think I may have got hurt a little bit, but it's okay. Uh, turi. Thank you

14:19.180 --> 14:24.140
All right, well, let's see if we can open up pop rocks with their feet and get my feet sweat to activate the pop rocks

14:24.700 --> 14:28.780
This might be very loud actually. Hold on. I'm gonna take it a little bit away from you. Okay

14:29.580 --> 14:32.300
I don't know if I can do it with my feet to rip open

14:33.900 --> 14:37.580
Anything is possible if you get your main stairs, right? So we have the

14:43.340 --> 14:48.860
Gripper repair funds for 10. Thank you so much. Oh, wait, wasn't there a red? Why is it not displaying?

14:48.860 --> 14:50.860
I could have sworn I saw a red earlier

14:51.580 --> 14:53.580
I'm uh, it was a red

14:53.820 --> 14:59.740
But jingle 100 in celebration your monetization. I gave you my first ever red so far. Thank you

15:01.740 --> 15:03.740
Thank you so much

15:03.740 --> 15:07.180
Do you guys think you better support the girls more than this? That's all I'm saying

15:10.380 --> 15:12.380
Oh, I don't think I can rip it open

15:14.300 --> 15:17.580
Actually having to use my brain power monkey feet go

15:17.580 --> 15:22.540
I can't see if there's like a pre rip section

15:24.940 --> 15:30.940
I can't see anything at all. That's why I've not turned my glasses. Uh, I'm trying to rip open, but it's gonna work

15:33.580 --> 15:35.580
Support the girls

15:37.820 --> 15:39.820
You've got my new ones

15:40.300 --> 15:42.300
Congrats on the monetization. Thank you

15:43.500 --> 15:45.500
It really wasn't that hard in the nicest

15:45.740 --> 15:50.780
Streams as a screen brotherhood and nerds out about it. Oh, yeah. No, thank you. That was a yeah

15:50.860 --> 15:55.420
I've worked really hard for that. Diddy. Thank you for becoming a member. Oh, I got a good call

15:55.500 --> 16:00.220
Hopefully I didn't mess it up. Congrats, honey. Hi rain. I am so sorry rain. Please don't look

16:00.620 --> 16:03.100
It's not what it looks like rain. It's a mistake. Okay

16:05.020 --> 16:07.020
Hi rain

16:07.100 --> 16:11.580
It reluctantly saying thank you for the 10. Did you want to put down a towel first last?

16:12.460 --> 16:14.460
Nah, it's fine

16:15.340 --> 16:16.860
the

16:16.860 --> 16:22.620
The place I am renting the car kits weren't even cleaned before I moved in so

16:23.500 --> 16:25.740
You get you get what you want back

16:29.500 --> 16:32.380
Thank you, uh, I'll let

16:33.980 --> 16:37.500
999 thank you for becoming a member. Okay, I don't know what I have to choose my hand

16:38.700 --> 16:43.340
Sorry, let's hold on. Oh wait. I'll do it off camera. Watch this. Oh look at my toes go

16:43.500 --> 16:50.060
Oh, oh, sorry. Oh, sorry. My toes weren't in frame. Oh dear. Oh, my toes weren't in frame. Oh, you couldn't see that

16:51.420 --> 16:53.420
But I did get them open

16:53.820 --> 17:00.780
So the way my feet sweat the most is in this section in between the toes. So this is what I'm basically going to aim for

17:01.740 --> 17:08.700
This is disgusting if this actually pops. This is this is awful if this genuinely pops because of my feet sweat

17:09.020 --> 17:11.020
This is terrible

17:11.020 --> 17:13.580
Um, key if the spadey, thank you

17:14.620 --> 17:16.620
If this pops, I'm actually gonna cry

17:17.500 --> 17:19.500
Hopefully it doesn't work. I don't think I need

17:21.020 --> 17:22.540
this one

17:22.540 --> 17:24.540
Hold on. I need to sit on the floor for this

17:24.940 --> 17:27.020
Oh, I need to do this with my foot

17:28.220 --> 17:30.220
As if this pops

17:32.940 --> 17:34.940
I can't hold them in my thorn

17:37.820 --> 17:40.380
Did it pop? No, I don't think I did. I think we're safe

17:40.700 --> 17:42.700
I think we're safe

17:43.420 --> 17:45.420
I can't do it

17:45.420 --> 17:47.420
Wait, did it pop? No. Oh

17:49.180 --> 17:51.180
I hear it. Shut up

17:54.220 --> 17:57.580
Did it pop? It's popping. No, that's so gross

17:59.420 --> 18:02.060
I'm gonna step my feet this way. Hold on. Like

18:11.340 --> 18:19.340
It popped. So now you're on the line about that. That's disgusting

18:19.980 --> 18:23.420
But yeah, I got real sweat feet. I also have sweaty hands. Maybe I would do it in my hand

18:27.580 --> 18:30.940
Oh, it's kind of the same thing where it's sweating between my fingers more

18:30.940 --> 18:37.820
Salt feet. Well, you want to lick them?

18:39.340 --> 18:44.140
Oh, right. Oh, no, it's getting sticky because my feet are over. I never thought this far ahead

18:45.820 --> 18:50.060
Why am I so low IQ? It's such a curse sometimes. Hold on

18:53.980 --> 18:59.420
Thank you Esteban Lomiel, if you're gonna remember. Thank you

19:00.300 --> 19:02.300
Uh, Colin

19:02.460 --> 19:07.020
Four, three, one, six, and thank you Shalom Plain

19:08.940 --> 19:12.140
She kind of dumb though. Sticky feet mean sticky floors

19:13.820 --> 19:15.340
Oof

19:15.340 --> 19:19.820
Let me put socks on after this stream. Oh, there's like bits and spots everywhere now

19:20.300 --> 19:26.380
You know what? Maybe that reefling was right and I should have put a towel down. Hold on. My sweaty hands are so sticky

19:26.380 --> 19:29.180
They're like it's it's sticking to my hands

19:30.060 --> 19:32.060
Look, it's actually a benefit

19:32.300 --> 19:35.980
It's actually a benefit. Okay. You just have to think of the situation

19:37.820 --> 19:42.780
Hold on. Let me just pop them up there. Our experiment has been conducted

19:44.780 --> 19:46.780
Grows, I know

19:47.420 --> 19:51.180
My ears have a pop rock sometimes. I'm trying to help. Actual squid behaviors

19:52.940 --> 19:54.940
Honestly

19:56.620 --> 20:02.300
Uh, this is welcome to the reefling membership tier and it says message redacted. I don't know how I was like, here you go

20:06.460 --> 20:09.900
Thank you, Breyoko for the

20:11.260 --> 20:14.460
Uh, super chat. Oh my god, super chat because I'm monetized

20:15.900 --> 20:19.420
Found your credit card. Congrats. Uh, maybe don't

20:20.300 --> 20:24.060
You don't have to support by the way. I always have free membership streams all the time

20:26.700 --> 20:31.420
Today we learned to always put damage up right and we're going to actually do ASMR at the same time to hold up

20:42.300 --> 20:47.420
Bull, I also got my skyrim achievements to work. I have like 12 skyrim achievements

20:47.580 --> 20:51.820
I don't know why they weren't displaying but we might be able to actually go back to the skyrim stream at a later time

20:52.620 --> 20:57.980
Boy, thank you for becoming the streamers. Totally bonkers. Congrats on the membership. Thank you

20:58.940 --> 21:00.940
But thank you, boy, for being a member. Thank you

21:01.740 --> 21:03.820
Uh, Sithman's for becoming a member as well

21:04.700 --> 21:05.500
Yeah

21:05.500 --> 21:07.500
Oh, you're getting tangled at the wazoo right now

21:12.060 --> 21:17.500
Next week, yeah, um our endurance stream of the week is reefling

21:19.020 --> 21:21.020
Hold on. Let me put these on, yeah

21:22.140 --> 21:24.140
Thank you, uh

21:24.220 --> 21:30.540
Shiori for becoming a member and thank you Dr. P for becoming a member. Hold on. This is going to take

21:31.340 --> 21:33.020
some

21:33.020 --> 21:35.020
manipulation because this ear

21:35.580 --> 21:38.300
Isn't sitting the way ears actually sit

21:42.940 --> 21:44.940
Oh

21:52.540 --> 21:54.540
Um

21:56.060 --> 22:03.660
You look on skyrim achievement and usually take like three streams unless your stream's super long. Yeah, I'm a bit of an endurance streamer

22:03.820 --> 22:05.820
Okay

22:06.460 --> 22:08.460
ASMR

22:08.860 --> 22:15.340
Thank you, Jay for the membership. Thank you. Oh, woo wee for the membership

22:18.940 --> 22:20.940
Oh no, they're coming off

22:21.980 --> 22:23.980
Hey, just say

22:25.420 --> 22:32.060
Wow those feet grew arms and hands out of nowhere. How a unique skill. Look, I'm a cephalopod. I have eight arms. Okay

22:33.580 --> 22:39.180
How do you buy membership? Oh, you don't have to there should be a join button, but it doesn't work everywhere

22:39.180 --> 22:44.220
So don't worry if you can't buy. I always have free streams coming out and the membership streams start

22:45.420 --> 22:47.100
next week

22:47.100 --> 22:49.100
not this week

22:49.580 --> 22:53.100
Because by the end of this week, I'll have everything in place

22:54.140 --> 22:57.500
Workwise so I only have to do shorts and I'm very glad

22:58.220 --> 23:01.260
I am so glad that all the responsibility has taken off me

23:01.980 --> 23:03.980
And I'm just a normal stromer

23:05.500 --> 23:07.500
We should have changed all our names into

23:08.060 --> 23:10.060
Jamal for the stream knowing

23:10.380 --> 23:12.380
More hand you would have said every person

23:13.260 --> 23:15.260
We should have one reflame

23:16.220 --> 23:19.740
It's all arms anyway the logic checks that definitely isn't influenced by the

23:23.020 --> 23:26.860
And the join button is sometimes not next to subscription on mobile

23:27.420 --> 23:31.180
Yeah, I guess if you're in the phone, but don't worry. You don't have to directly support me

23:31.260 --> 23:37.260
I'll always have free streams coming out like all the time. I'm not kidding. You can't

23:37.900 --> 23:39.900
Take me off

23:41.260 --> 23:42.620
Come on

23:42.620 --> 23:44.620
You can't it's not possible

23:45.340 --> 23:47.340
So don't try and take me off

23:48.060 --> 23:50.700
Bless the shimmy. Thank you. We've got everything there. Remember

23:54.060 --> 23:56.060
Are you doing

23:56.940 --> 23:59.740
Me with my dogs are you doing hypnosis soon?

24:00.780 --> 24:05.740
Not right now. No, no of these. I don't think I I don't think anyone can get hypnotized by freaking toes

24:06.460 --> 24:09.900
You can see how opaque my skin is and you can see my blue veins

24:10.060 --> 24:16.940
You check them things out. You can literally see them and my little tendons if you look hard enough for them. Yeah. Oh, there they are

24:18.140 --> 24:20.140
Look at them tendons

24:26.140 --> 24:29.500
Thank you for the tip. Oh, hold on string on the swing

24:30.380 --> 24:33.340
Did brian talk right did brian say anything?

24:34.140 --> 24:36.140
I hope not

24:36.380 --> 24:39.260
Oh, it's kind of working

24:40.460 --> 24:41.580
Okay

24:41.580 --> 24:48.540
Stream elements is no kind of working mika's mika's big fan. Thank you for the five gifted memberships

24:49.820 --> 24:54.060
Um, and then boys that trigger were just purple burglar alarm honestly

24:55.820 --> 24:59.180
Brian said it but he was quiet good. I'm glad I didn't say it

25:06.860 --> 25:12.780
Uh, bejinga. Oh and celebration. I get my first ever. Yes. I did

25:14.620 --> 25:17.180
I'm so sorry. I'm very scared our brain right now

25:18.220 --> 25:26.140
Um secret. Thank you for becoming a member. This is a crazy ASMR concept. It's maybe an ASMR. Let's be honest. I'm just home

25:26.780 --> 25:28.780
I'm just home. See you and

25:29.340 --> 25:31.340
I'm gonna feel

25:36.860 --> 25:38.860
What

25:39.660 --> 25:41.660
At their name

25:41.740 --> 25:43.740
At their scrawny, I just want to

25:44.380 --> 25:47.900
I just want to stream what I want and enjoy corpus. You can't do that

25:47.900 --> 25:52.940
You'll never be successful scrawny who my beer makes whole companies of like-minded people to stream with

25:53.420 --> 25:56.060
I cannot tell you how unbelievably

25:56.780 --> 26:01.340
NICE is thank you for that a that type of there any I cannot tell you how unbelievably nice

26:01.660 --> 26:05.980
It's to have like-minded individuals knowing these arrests

26:06.780 --> 26:12.300
Like I jumped on my alternative twitter was like listening to the feed. I'm just sitting listening to ac

26:12.780 --> 26:13.740
You know

26:13.740 --> 26:19.980
Tinkle and I'm just like, yeah. Yeah, this is actually quite good quality. Honestly. I wouldn't mind if she brought a 3d one there

26:20.380 --> 26:25.500
It is so nice to have like-minded individuals that are like, yeah, let's provide the goods

26:26.460 --> 26:34.140
We say no to blue balling here. Okay. You ask and you receive. Okay. You ask other agencies. You get donor walled

26:36.060 --> 26:39.820
Hold on. I'm gonna take a drink of water. I'm gonna put dehydrate. Please take a drink as well

26:39.820 --> 26:41.820
So

26:49.260 --> 26:52.140
Peeler allegations are yet to be resolved

26:52.700 --> 26:58.220
I will make a public statement about the peeler allegations as you can see we're in very hot water about the peeler

27:01.180 --> 27:04.620
What is donor walled donor walled is when someone

27:05.020 --> 27:09.420
gives a streamer a lot of money via a donation and

27:09.820 --> 27:11.820
the streamer doesn't read it out loud for

27:12.460 --> 27:15.740
Whatever reason it may be they genuinely missed it. That's very plausible

27:15.820 --> 27:19.020
Um, they don't want to acknowledge it because of maybe the contents

27:19.580 --> 27:23.420
Um, but donor walling is the term when someone gives over money and

27:28.060 --> 27:30.060
Thank you for coming on

27:33.500 --> 27:35.820
Good luck with the pr camp

27:35.820 --> 27:40.380
Okay, i'm me when jen2 comes out the p the pr camp

27:45.420 --> 27:47.420
Peeler the best station in the world

27:51.420 --> 27:57.260
Okay, I genuinely think I managed to catch up to everyone. Thank you so much for like all the love and support

27:57.340 --> 28:02.700
I actually i'm like really overwhelmed right now and I feel so out of my element. I'm like, oh my god. What do I do?

28:02.940 --> 28:04.940
Can I

28:06.380 --> 28:08.380
I figured out

28:10.300 --> 28:14.860
Right, so you may notice that my tier two is 4.99

28:15.580 --> 28:22.380
I don't think it can be gifted unless on purpose, right? Like can you not just manually put in gift 1.99?

28:23.740 --> 28:25.740
Internet bazzle

28:25.820 --> 28:27.820
Feeze. Thank you for the member

28:28.540 --> 28:35.500
Hold on. I'm like trying so hard to do this. Veeler needs to rehire a peer position a PR position

28:42.140 --> 28:47.980
This is embarrassing I can't grip it. Oh, there we go. Wow surprise surprise if you used to the feet you can grip it really well

28:48.140 --> 28:55.260
Hmm. Hmm. Uh, Jeremy. Thank you for coming to man bar. I'm so sorry to anyone. I'm alien right now in this room

28:55.820 --> 28:57.820
I literally this is getting

28:57.820 --> 28:59.820
Come on, please

29:01.020 --> 29:03.020
Okay, here we go. We'll do it like this

29:05.420 --> 29:11.020
What a strike. Thank you for the five gifted members. Did it do it more?

29:11.980 --> 29:13.980
You guys have a look now

29:14.780 --> 29:19.660
Jake Jake said pre lived grippers. Let's go honestly

29:25.980 --> 29:27.980
Oh, there we go. We got it

29:29.660 --> 29:31.660
Oh my god, we got it

29:32.780 --> 29:34.780
The deck's theory

29:34.940 --> 29:36.460
Just admit it

29:36.460 --> 29:42.380
Just admit it. No other streamer is even capable of doing this physically because they wouldn't they wouldn't be able to do that

29:46.220 --> 29:49.900
This is absolutely staggering. Did anyone tickle?

29:50.700 --> 29:54.940
Or is everyone just like blown away by this and even being a stream concept?

29:56.380 --> 30:00.060
Do you know how long I've planned this for? I've planned this for

30:01.900 --> 30:03.900
I planned this

30:04.460 --> 30:06.460
Back when I was concepted

30:06.780 --> 30:12.540
To have french tits and nails, which is absolutely awful. I've been waiting months on this idea

30:14.060 --> 30:18.220
To utilize it it manna's up one. Thank you for coming on this one

30:20.060 --> 30:24.300
Oh, right. Can I do two at once? I think I can

30:26.540 --> 30:28.540
Hold them by the bottom

30:33.260 --> 30:35.260
Oh, we're losing them

30:35.820 --> 30:41.260
My feet are so sweaty that they're right. They're up and then oh, they're up a bit too much

30:44.620 --> 30:46.620
I can do this chat. Let me cook

30:49.980 --> 30:51.980
Does that even work?

30:52.780 --> 30:57.260
Oh my ankle just cracked. Did you hear that? Literally dual wielding the tingles right now

30:59.500 --> 31:02.540
We're in on our we're in uncharted territory

31:03.500 --> 31:09.980
Literally. Oh, for goodness sake. Why can I not do it with that one back? I wonder if the uh plaster is actually helping me grip this one

31:13.660 --> 31:19.820
I'm dual wielding tingle. Oh, wait. I think my feet are actually getting too sweaty to pick this up because it's the wire

31:20.300 --> 31:22.300
I

31:26.300 --> 31:28.860
Think I'm literally right. Hold on. We'll just go the brush

31:34.140 --> 31:37.500
Make me thank you for becoming a member. I appreciate you

31:39.420 --> 31:43.660
If this isn't peak streaming, I don't know what honestly like with your

31:43.900 --> 31:47.580
Would yours where the heck is my other oh here?

31:53.100 --> 32:00.220
Dual wield brushes from one come on admit it. It's just so hard to do because of the ankle

32:01.580 --> 32:04.700
Oh, there we go. I just need to relax the gripper

32:06.940 --> 32:08.940
Is the Mars

32:09.820 --> 32:11.820
I'm impressed

32:11.820 --> 32:15.740
Did you watch the new ankle showcase apparently fable 4 is coming out?

32:20.940 --> 32:23.980
We love joe feet wielding tingles. I bet you do

32:24.620 --> 32:27.580
Wah, thank you for becoming a member. Yay fable

32:28.540 --> 32:35.500
But they were saying and apparently the new dragon age origins has like a ton of little g fans really mad because there's something

32:35.900 --> 32:37.500
The

32:37.500 --> 32:40.300
Oh, and my feet are actually too to get into sway

32:42.300 --> 32:44.300
Hold on

32:55.340 --> 32:57.340
She's foot maxing on

32:57.340 --> 32:59.340
No

33:03.420 --> 33:09.740
From a 200 build in Skyrim to a dual wield built the next day so talented I knew I knew

33:10.620 --> 33:14.460
Isn't this amazing because look at the gel shine on that big toe

33:15.580 --> 33:17.900
Look at that shine. Oh, that's gorgeous

33:19.420 --> 33:21.420
I

33:21.420 --> 33:23.420
Do

33:32.860 --> 33:39.900
Oh my ring late there that's which uh late enough the deck under here because it's all dark

33:40.940 --> 33:42.940
So that's what the gel polish is doing

33:44.380 --> 33:46.380
Uh delicious brown white food

33:47.420 --> 33:49.420
Thank you for becoming

33:52.380 --> 33:54.380
Not 3d what should have been me

33:57.340 --> 34:04.300
Hammerfell is gonna come in 2026 if we're lucky. I'll be so interested to see if I'll enjoy the game or not

34:04.620 --> 34:08.060
I might be one of those games where I have to play offline for the first time

34:08.700 --> 34:11.980
to even appreciate it. I don't know if you ever like

34:14.060 --> 34:18.380
You know your first playthrough of a game you're so silent and so quiet because you're just

34:18.380 --> 34:21.740
Experiencing it for the first time. So I feel like it would be hard to commentate

34:21.740 --> 34:25.020
Like I really want to play big ball these days, but I'm worried

34:25.260 --> 34:29.260
I won't have a thought like a single thought formed because I've never played it before

34:32.460 --> 34:37.180
I'm sad I can't hear but the visuals the visuals though. Yeah, you like the vision

34:38.220 --> 34:40.540
Oh my god, can I do the middle finger on a tool?

34:45.420 --> 34:47.420
And then bring you back up again

34:48.380 --> 34:51.340
And then everyone go down. Oh, no, it's not gonna work. I don't have that kind of

34:51.820 --> 34:55.340
I don't have that kind of tool dexter. You have the cane where I can like grip around and stuff

34:56.220 --> 34:57.660
Yeah

34:57.660 --> 34:59.660
my appendages

34:59.900 --> 35:05.980
My appendages, I'm actually tempted to leave these on because it's helping to muffle me making any mistakes

35:07.340 --> 35:09.180
Crone

35:09.180 --> 35:11.180
shimmer pants

35:11.820 --> 35:17.020
Thank you for the time. Congrats on monetization, Stony. Thank you. Thank you for the direct support

35:17.740 --> 35:24.460
A fan made more remaster of oblivion made in Skyrim's engine is coming out into it with us here

35:26.300 --> 35:28.300
We do a little tapping ASMR

35:28.620 --> 35:31.260
It sounds like I don't have the dexterity to do the frog thing

35:32.220 --> 35:38.540
If Walsham Gromit aren't becoming Crimes of Beyond on our film. Oh, there's a Walsham Gromit thing coming out

35:38.940 --> 35:42.860
How far can your pinky go? What do you even thought? I'm gonna go like

35:47.980 --> 35:49.980
Sky oblivion

35:52.060 --> 35:54.060
Get Nordic get Nordic get Nordic

35:58.140 --> 36:05.340
It's commonly referred to as sky oblivion by the project workers. I mean, wouldn't they not get a season's assist if they're doing that?

36:10.540 --> 36:12.860
Cup your ears. I'm cupping your ears

36:12.940 --> 36:17.420
There's also a mod project that makes all of

36:18.060 --> 36:20.060
Nym

36:20.940 --> 36:24.300
I would love us the moral wind remake would come out, but we were hope

36:24.780 --> 36:29.500
Geez Gromit. I'm sure there's like a new Walsham Gromit thing coming out. I don't know if it's amusing

36:30.940 --> 36:34.380
Because everyone was like, oh new Walsham Gromit before GTA 6

36:35.980 --> 36:41.420
No, because it's fantastic fan made mod is free. Ah, so they got away with it

36:43.180 --> 36:46.620
But then that doesn't actually get up a day about more than asset impact

36:47.820 --> 36:54.620
Fallout 3 new Vegas thing. What were the accusations that Fallout 4 got the most useless update recently?

36:55.180 --> 37:01.500
And it was to spite modders to break them all or something without Fallout 4 or did I make that up?

37:03.740 --> 37:07.980
The amount of complete rework done in Skyrim engine is crazy

37:07.980 --> 37:09.980
Oh

37:11.500 --> 37:15.580
Daniel or my microphone, by the way, it keeps picking red

37:17.020 --> 37:19.020
but

37:20.860 --> 37:26.460
Yeah, they had more than you'll hope their studio got burned over stuff and all of that way from the Walsham Gromit

37:28.300 --> 37:30.780
I'm playing Fallout 4 right now

37:31.020 --> 37:41.020
They update Fallout 4 due to the show and it broke all the mods in the mod. Oh, okay, that makes more sense

37:42.540 --> 37:49.340
That makes it good. Okay, it keeps picking red and I'm like, am I am I'm like rippers to okay for this microphone right now?

37:50.300 --> 37:52.300
Hmm

37:57.900 --> 38:03.900
Peter Salas, the voice gromit passed away. Oh, I guess I don't have to get excited

38:08.700 --> 38:10.700
That sounds good, I'm glad

38:11.100 --> 38:14.140
I'm sorry, my ears are fine. My ears are okay

38:15.020 --> 38:19.340
Um, just so you know for the replays, this isn't an endurance stream. I'm

38:20.300 --> 38:24.700
I'm very out of my element with the webcam on and I'm like

38:26.060 --> 38:28.060
Okay, now what?

38:28.940 --> 38:34.380
I'm like, okay, but thank you so so much to everyone who's membering thanks to so so much

38:34.460 --> 38:39.260
everyone who's like super Chan or Tiffin or anything like it's such a fantastic help and

38:40.060 --> 38:43.500
um like obviously I don't want to say too much but

38:44.220 --> 38:49.500
You know, it takes a year to create a new generation. So this is very reassuring

38:50.620 --> 38:55.260
Um, if there may or may not be some plans in the background. Ho ho ho

38:56.380 --> 39:01.580
Um, we love mommy. Love you Eastling. Thank you. Seriously. Like I'm a bit overwhelmed

39:01.660 --> 39:05.100
Like I literally have my hands like this because I'm like, oh, okay

39:05.980 --> 39:12.780
Um, I was nervous because I don't know what to do. These are what's to say. Genius idea. Please. I was going to do a

39:12.780 --> 39:19.820
webcam stream on buckshot relay and then you guys can tell me to put my feet back on the floor because I'll always sit on them

39:25.900 --> 39:27.900
Absolutely there was a gorgeous laugh

39:30.060 --> 39:31.260
Thanks

39:31.260 --> 39:34.700
Yes, I just filled out my element. I'm like, I'm used to meman

39:35.420 --> 39:39.900
I'm used to well, I guess this stream is a big mean to be honest. I don't use to put that much

39:40.780 --> 39:42.140
like

39:42.540 --> 39:45.100
What's the word that much? I did bring

39:45.900 --> 39:50.940
I know everyone is tired of japanese youth cleaning tool and it gets done today

39:51.340 --> 39:52.540
but

39:52.540 --> 39:53.820
it's true

39:53.820 --> 39:55.340
Thank you

39:55.340 --> 40:04.940
Tico so well for becoming a member. I can't pick this up. Hold on. All right. Thank you, bernie. You said for becoming a member and thank you

40:05.900 --> 40:07.020

40:09.420 --> 40:11.420
Wow

40:11.420 --> 40:16.380
Sorry, I'm late. No need to be sorry at all. Thank you for becoming a member. Forgiveness sake

40:17.340 --> 40:19.900
When it's really thin, it's so hard to grip

40:20.540 --> 40:21.820
seriously

40:21.820 --> 40:26.140
I feel like I read just like them right around to like bring it closer

40:27.020 --> 40:30.380
And then I need to take this off gently. I can't even do that

40:31.180 --> 40:33.180
That's right. You're cleaning via foot

40:33.180 --> 40:35.180
Or whatever

40:36.860 --> 40:40.140
I don't know internet basu file meal talk

40:40.140 --> 40:44.460
It's cool to see you willing to be able to it's a challenge even with a handful of people much less

40:45.180 --> 40:46.380
300

40:46.380 --> 40:49.500
It's 300 this is 600 throwing money literally

40:50.700 --> 40:55.820
I I'm definitely not a hand cam streamer. I don't think I don't don't expect any foot cam hand cam

40:57.020 --> 41:02.380
After this, I'm gonna be honest. I'm like, oh, it's not for me, right? We're gonna do this as gently as possible. Okay

41:03.580 --> 41:05.580
gentle

41:06.780 --> 41:11.900
Thank you for coming to my ear cleaning foot spa experience

41:15.180 --> 41:17.180
I ran to thank you for becoming a member

41:18.140 --> 41:20.140
Now just let the brush

41:21.100 --> 41:23.100
slowly glide

41:23.980 --> 41:25.980
across your ear

41:27.100 --> 41:30.220
And as the brush cleans the outer ear

41:30.220 --> 41:35.260
Hold on you will find yourself. Hold on and I relax

41:40.860 --> 41:42.860
There

41:42.940 --> 41:44.940
Just like this

41:46.380 --> 41:49.900
Instructional ASMR just let me ASMR you

41:51.020 --> 41:53.020
Oh, yeah, that's right. That's the money shot

41:53.020 --> 41:55.020
Oh

41:56.540 --> 42:03.580
I'm trip my poor pinky. Look how hard my pinky is trying right now. My pinky is like going to france without hardest time

42:05.180 --> 42:07.180
I'm trying to like use

42:11.100 --> 42:14.780
You can't be feetlings anymore after the stream, I don't think you're feetlings

42:14.780 --> 42:19.180
I think uh, I'll stick to the VTuber model because I'm like so nervous with the webcam on

42:19.980 --> 42:21.980
Plastic girl, thank you for the 10

42:22.940 --> 42:30.060

43:05.660 --> 43:08.220
This is literally my left foot is like unless

43:08.940 --> 43:10.940
Unless I hold it like a pencil

43:11.660 --> 43:13.980
Hold on I need to like dab against myself

43:14.940 --> 43:23.260
Just know whenever you hear ear cleaning in my ASMR role plays. It's not done by my hands. It's done by my foot

43:24.140 --> 43:26.140
I spit holding him

43:27.260 --> 43:35.100
Thank you everyone for membership and supporting me. I appreciate it. We are testing if tier two needs to be higher than

43:35.900 --> 43:37.900
um

43:38.380 --> 43:46.140
4.99 US dollars, but I don't think it has to be not from what I've seen

43:50.460 --> 43:52.460
Oh, no, it's dropped again. Jeez

43:53.900 --> 43:58.860
This is really difficult. I thought I had a bit more. I think because it's so thin

44:00.540 --> 44:02.540
Okay

44:05.420 --> 44:08.300
It's gone again. I'm going to have to joe wield this

44:11.020 --> 44:13.020
Double the twos

44:13.500 --> 44:14.220
Uh

44:14.220 --> 44:16.060
Be

44:16.060 --> 44:21.100
G. Thank you for the membership. I appreciate it. We're swapping. We're swapping. I can't do this anymore

44:24.140 --> 44:26.140
I said let's do the bubbles

44:26.380 --> 44:28.380
I

44:29.900 --> 44:36.700
The most bizarre monetization celebration I've ever seen. I've actually outdone myself. I've actually surprised myself

44:38.380 --> 44:40.620
Weird this concept is can the bubble come?

44:45.180 --> 44:47.980
Sorry, that was probably really loud. I'm so sorry

44:49.500 --> 44:51.820
I hope no one's actually consuming this stream

44:52.620 --> 44:59.020
Uh, uh, uh the level of like loud ASMR. No, don't listen to the stream at ASMR levels

44:59.260 --> 45:04.940
Don't be silly my skull. We're fine. Okay, I was gonna say don't be silly and listen at ASMR levels

45:05.260 --> 45:10.220
My feet are literally the pilot. You're telling me you trust my feet not to ever make a blip

45:11.420 --> 45:17.820
I know my ear drum's still there. Ow my ear. Yeah. No, don't listen at ASMR levels. Don't be silly so much

45:18.780 --> 45:21.180
There's absolutely no way right

45:22.540 --> 45:24.140
So

45:24.140 --> 45:32.300
For some reason stream elements can see when you guys gift other people but it won't register a membership if you bought it yourself

45:32.380 --> 45:34.380
I don't know why

45:34.780 --> 45:36.780
You're kicking in domestic

45:40.460 --> 45:45.580
Fiat, thank you for becoming a member. Is your name fiat for a particular reason

45:47.980 --> 45:49.980
I don't know

45:54.860 --> 45:57.020
What that's strange. Yeah, I don't know why

45:57.020 --> 46:03.020
No, I'm gonna lie to you your voice overpowers any sound I could have paired so far would mean the difference

46:08.540 --> 46:12.940
Hi, Stony, congrats on unlock monetization. Thank you

46:12.940 --> 46:14.940
Oh

46:17.340 --> 46:18.300
Thank you

46:18.300 --> 46:24.220
Remember just for anyone listening. You don't actually have the member by the way. I always have free content coming out

46:24.220 --> 46:25.740
So, please don't worry

46:25.740 --> 46:31.020
Please make sure you look after yourself first such as you pay off your debts because we live in a society

46:31.820 --> 46:36.140
And if you're debt-free, it's good for you but bad for society

46:36.860 --> 46:38.860
But we can get into that in another stream

46:39.020 --> 46:40.060
John

46:40.060 --> 46:46.540
John zero seven. Thank you for the membership. I appreciate it. Sorry about all the camera glitching by the way. This is a very

46:48.380 --> 46:49.660
Dusty

46:49.660 --> 46:51.660
webcam a very dusty

46:53.020 --> 46:57.100
Narrow, thank you for becoming a member or narrow to two seven six

46:57.100 --> 47:01.580
Like I was supposed to say your phone. I might want to do it because the cameras think okay

47:05.180 --> 47:08.780
Peppermint did I say that right pepper peppermint

47:09.500 --> 47:11.340
There's no arm

47:11.340 --> 47:13.340
Okay

47:14.140 --> 47:18.140
You never mind. Okay, never mind. Oh, we got there in the end

47:19.100 --> 47:22.380
Don't worry, Stony, even if we get our ears bumped, you're still the best put stream

47:23.420 --> 47:25.580
Oh, is that my new title now? Like the best

47:27.660 --> 47:30.220
I would honestly take that title. I'm quite happy with that title

47:30.380 --> 47:32.380
Oh

47:36.460 --> 47:37.900
It's all right

47:37.900 --> 47:39.900
My feet are here to comfort me

47:40.780 --> 47:45.340
When it has been a long day. My sweaty grippers are here to

47:46.300 --> 47:51.900
Pretend to tangle you because let's be honest. This isn't an ASMR stream. No one believes at all

47:51.900 --> 47:56.940
This is an ASMR stream just because you have the three view. It doesn't make it an ASMR stream

47:57.260 --> 48:04.540
Which is why the title is called monetization celebration stream and not ASMR

48:06.620 --> 48:13.740
Uh, watch mercy stream. I was wondering if you can do a Q&A too. I would absolutely love to you. That is I would love to do a Q&A

48:14.940 --> 48:20.060
Maybe we can read membership membership marshmallow. We can read marshmallow. Absolutely

48:20.700 --> 48:22.700
Air Rock Starly

48:22.700 --> 48:24.700
Air Rock Starly

48:25.180 --> 48:27.020
Yes

48:27.020 --> 48:29.020
We can 100% do

48:29.260 --> 48:31.820
Marshmallow reading that would be fantastic

48:32.620 --> 48:35.740
um, although mercy was like purposely like

48:36.300 --> 48:39.980
Seeing stuff wrong, which was quite funny like really giving bad advice

48:40.540 --> 48:42.540
Logan have a let. Thank you so much

48:44.140 --> 48:47.740
If you hear my stomach, it's not because I'm hungry and starving

48:48.300 --> 48:52.940
It's because I got our massive loaf of bread and Nina wouldn't come out before the stream

48:52.940 --> 48:57.340
I went to the toilet three times and I never came out. I'm sorry for your stomach

49:00.300 --> 49:05.100
This could be really funny for an April full stream. Well, you and the grippers out again

49:05.820 --> 49:07.820
What would the title of the stream be?

49:09.980 --> 49:16.380
Too many people ask real questions, but most of my scenes of the vice was real was it? Wait, hold on. Let me get my marshmallow

49:16.540 --> 49:18.540
It's like as a movement

49:18.540 --> 49:20.540
Uh-oh

49:21.500 --> 49:24.940
And then I'll I'll go up the link. It's only a couple, okay

49:28.380 --> 49:34.700
You ask me anything and before I can hardly say anything that is

49:36.380 --> 49:38.380
Wait, where can I find this?

49:39.420 --> 49:41.980
I would like to pin it but the love heart is in the way

49:42.700 --> 49:46.220
I don't someone at youtube you're telling me not one person at youtube

49:46.940 --> 49:49.900
Is aware of this issue and fuse

49:51.260 --> 49:53.260
10

49:55.820 --> 50:01.180
April fools. How does it April fools if I've already done it? I've already got you the gag is been done

50:06.380 --> 50:08.780
Okay, that's my marshmallow thing

50:10.300 --> 50:12.300
And

50:12.380 --> 50:14.380
Oh

50:15.820 --> 50:21.100
No, tier two is what's getting gifted mommy you have to raise a pegs for both ears

50:22.380 --> 50:31.420
Wait, no, I only want emotes to be gifted. I wanted to leave emotes as $199 and I have to make it $5 for tier two

50:33.820 --> 50:35.820
Honestly the mental

50:36.780 --> 50:46.460
The mental stress of raising it by two cents is really good to me. Hey, babe badding gadding. Thank you for the membership. I appreciate it

50:47.260 --> 50:51.020
We did warn you. I was just wanting them to work so badly

50:52.300 --> 50:56.780
Oh, I don't want to raise the price. I have to apparently if I want to raise the price

50:56.860 --> 51:01.020
I need to close the tier and then open up a new one. I don't even know what happens

51:01.260 --> 51:05.740
It only lets you donate the 499 tier. Oh

51:07.660 --> 51:12.140
I'm so happy to have you back. I missed you. I missed you too. Oh, that's so annoying

51:13.900 --> 51:15.900
and

51:17.020 --> 51:18.140
Oh

51:18.140 --> 51:24.780
I have to raise the price by freaking dollar. So by dollar by a cent. So if I make it

51:25.900 --> 51:29.900
You would leave emotes at $199 but tier two has to go up to $5.99

51:31.740 --> 51:33.740
Oh

51:34.060 --> 51:36.060
Does it actually have to be

51:45.900 --> 51:48.780
Yeah, you has to go $5.99

51:50.780 --> 51:53.740
It's just a dollar do it, but you don't understand

51:54.060 --> 51:58.060
You don't understand the principle about how much I can glow and brag

51:58.140 --> 52:03.660
That's only $9.99 to support your oshi for a month. I feel or you don't understand

52:09.260 --> 52:14.860
Okay, but it's kind of more of the youtube channel having to make problems. It's fine. Oh

52:15.980 --> 52:18.220
So right I guess after the stream

52:19.900 --> 52:23.100
For those of you who sign up now for the tier two

52:23.500 --> 52:27.820
I think you only have to pay the one dollar difference to get on the tier that is

52:28.700 --> 52:33.580
Oh, that's so annoying. Can I can I make that new tier live at least or is this like

52:34.700 --> 52:36.700
I don't know how youtube's gonna take this

52:39.180 --> 52:41.660
Oh, I don't know youtube's gonna like me hold on

52:46.140 --> 52:48.140
Levels edit levels

52:48.940 --> 52:50.940
No

52:51.340 --> 52:56.460
It locked in the price is locked in I don't want to put up a dollar, but I have to

53:00.380 --> 53:05.260
Oh my god, please youtube sound right. I have to basically add a new let tier

53:06.460 --> 53:11.900
Oh for goodness sake wifling member stream tier

53:12.860 --> 53:14.860
Oh and

53:15.020 --> 53:17.020

53:17.020 --> 53:19.020
You know tier

53:19.420 --> 53:22.460
Oh, okay. All right. Hold on. We're trying to do it together

53:23.020 --> 53:27.580
Right. We need to do it in american double laws united states set a price

53:28.540 --> 53:30.540
$5.99

53:36.380 --> 53:39.980
Let's give that man a backshot. What wait, what did this happen?

53:40.940 --> 53:44.460
We're doing it live. We're doing it live. We are wifling

53:45.340 --> 53:53.820
Real I'll just put wifling member real tier because that's I'm out of things and then add a pair

53:55.260 --> 53:57.260
Fucking

53:57.340 --> 54:00.700
Membership stream membership only live streams

54:01.500 --> 54:03.500
This the real deal

54:03.660 --> 54:04.940
Y'all

54:05.020 --> 54:09.980
And then pair of instructions nothing because you guys don't need to do anything the next what happens

54:11.260 --> 54:15.660
I understand that once my offer is reviews improved. I'm unable to change to introduce a new price

54:15.740 --> 54:22.380
I can create a new level and or delete any existing deleting a level will cancel existing memberships if that happens

54:23.740 --> 54:28.300
Okay submit for review. Yes my tier my mem my freaking

54:28.940 --> 54:31.500
membership streams do not have

54:32.460 --> 54:34.540
Sorry, I'm like straight up talking. There's a thing

54:37.260 --> 54:42.460
No, it does not come right. Your perk is being sent for review. It said

54:43.980 --> 54:45.980
$5.99

54:47.340 --> 54:50.940
Well, that's so expensive. I'm gonna have to stream like way more than

54:52.220 --> 54:56.540
I'm gonna have to stream more to earn that because 5.9 is really getting expensive

54:57.500 --> 55:00.060
There's even display the damn thing

55:02.460 --> 55:09.900
Uh, right it doesn't display it because it's not been approved by youtube question mark

55:13.100 --> 55:14.700
It's one dollar

55:14.700 --> 55:16.860
So like all the tier 2s will be reset

55:17.420 --> 55:24.380
So the tier 2s can upgrade via a dollar. I'm like 90% sure you already stream more than most. It's no problem

55:25.100 --> 55:29.820
We can buy one less candy per month. You already stream every day. Yeah

55:30.140 --> 55:34.060
Well, you're ready for multiple streams in one day of different things. Yeah

55:35.260 --> 55:37.260
Am I losing my membership tier?

55:38.620 --> 55:40.620
Maybe

55:43.340 --> 55:48.060
Why does it not work? Why does it not work?

55:51.180 --> 55:55.500
So what does this say is it there? No, it's not been approved. So you can't see it

55:55.820 --> 56:02.460
Ellie bot. Thank you for the membership upgrade. Why does it specify you upgraded? That's so specific

56:03.500 --> 56:07.020
Oh, no more streams. Oh, no. Thank you for fixing it

56:08.140 --> 56:12.780
Yes, so we need to wait for youtube to approve the new tier and then that's the actual tier

56:13.980 --> 56:17.820
Um, I guess but I don't know how long it takes to get it approved

56:19.260 --> 56:25.020
I wonder actually I wonder if youtube is going to be able to see that is so similar to the second one

56:25.100 --> 56:29.740
And they're going to be like, yeah, you're dumb. You praised it wrong. Didn't you and I'm like, yes, I praised it wrong

56:29.820 --> 56:31.820
Please forgive me. I'm sorry

56:32.620 --> 56:35.420
And then youtube will be like I will have mercy on yourself

56:37.020 --> 56:41.260
Your levels are approved publish. Wait, what I already got approved wait

56:42.780 --> 56:46.540
Hello youtube. Are you watching me right now? I promise I'm not doing anything bad

56:47.340 --> 56:52.140
Feet are a natural part of the body. Um, thank you for monetizing me youtube

56:52.140 --> 56:55.980
Please don't take it away. Is youtube actually here right now? Why did it just get approved?

56:57.180 --> 56:59.740
Is it approved? Is it live? Wait, hold on. Let me try

57:01.900 --> 57:07.180
Oh, okay. Wow it is. Okay, right. I'm going to delete the other tier

57:08.140 --> 57:15.100
Okay, thank you for upgrading. Did I delete it now? And then oh my god, everyone's upgraded. Thank you so much

57:15.180 --> 57:19.260
I'm so sorry be funds. I'm so so sorry. I've completely missed this

57:19.980 --> 57:24.860
I've absolutely balls this one up. Right. I will delete the

57:25.980 --> 57:30.380
How do I delete it? I do I will delete it delete this level if you delete a level

57:30.460 --> 57:32.780
Members of that level will lose their membership

57:33.180 --> 57:39.500
Consider notifying them before deleting encouraging them to change levels any member that purchased this level this month will be

57:40.140 --> 57:47.100
Reimbursed. Okay, that's good. Any member that purchased this level this month will be reimbursed

57:48.060 --> 57:53.740
Okay, youtube. I'm reading that myself. Once you submit your changes, they'll get approved. Delete

57:55.660 --> 57:57.660
Next

57:57.660 --> 57:59.660
Submit and review

58:00.300 --> 58:05.020
I understand that once my offer is reviewed and approved all members of deleted levels will lose their membership

58:05.100 --> 58:08.060
It will be reimbursed for the last month. Okay

58:08.700 --> 58:10.700
Submit for review

58:10.780 --> 58:13.260
We're doing it live. Okay, we can do it live

58:13.660 --> 58:15.660
Do it live

58:15.740 --> 58:17.740
publish

58:18.380 --> 58:20.380
Did that work? What does it say now?

58:21.420 --> 58:24.140
Wait, hold on. Let me refresh. Hold on. I think we did it

58:24.780 --> 58:26.780
Hold on pause. I think we did it

58:28.220 --> 58:30.940
We did it. Okay. I will not mess up with the girls

58:31.740 --> 58:33.980
But I will okay there we go

58:34.140 --> 58:37.900
I believe it's fully working now if you do gift memberships

58:37.980 --> 58:42.300
It will only go to refling emotes which I need to add a sugar ton to

58:42.780 --> 58:47.740
Because it was like you're only allowed to add four emotes until you get more members

58:47.980 --> 58:53.100
So I'll add to the rest and I'll commission a ton more because with the amount of membership

58:54.300 --> 59:00.220
I think there's quite more than 10 slots that I have. Thank you so much for your patience for me doing this

59:00.380 --> 59:03.180
Thank you everyone who is I upgrading to the new tier

59:04.300 --> 59:06.300
I do apologize

59:06.380 --> 59:08.140
and

59:08.140 --> 59:15.180
For the mistake. I really severely wanted membership gifting to be on emotes only

59:15.580 --> 59:18.540
Because I didn't want to charge more than five

59:19.500 --> 59:21.580
99 no

59:21.580 --> 59:23.580
4.99

59:23.740 --> 59:30.300
But thank you everyone. That's upgrading. Can I see your upgrades? Nope. Uh streaml is just really doesn't like it

59:31.100 --> 59:33.100
Um, that's very curious

59:34.380 --> 59:36.380
Uh very curious indeed

59:36.700 --> 59:44.620
But I won't mess up for the girls when I enable it. I don't know if and when I don't know shebe's doing hers right now

59:45.420 --> 59:50.300
If she is it's a surprise. I don't know if I'm the only one who's currently doing the membership member

59:52.940 --> 59:56.860
Oh my god, I don't think wait, it's not telling me the upgrades

59:57.900 --> 59:59.900
No

01:00:01.180 --> 01:00:03.580
It's not telling me when you've upgraded

01:00:03.820 --> 01:00:04.940
It's

01:00:04.940 --> 01:00:11.500
Like on my screen on any screen. I'm so sorry. I don't think I can keep up with the upgrades. Thank you everyone who's upgrading. I appreciate it

01:00:12.060 --> 01:00:14.700
I'm so sorry. I suck. I'm suck as a streamer

01:00:16.380 --> 01:00:18.380
My apologies for such a

01:00:19.180 --> 01:00:25.180
Unprofessional start, but then again, is it really me if it's not unprofessional? It's so over

01:00:26.940 --> 01:00:29.100
We will support the cut for this regard. Thank you

01:00:29.180 --> 01:00:35.020
I think it's not an upgrade now because it's the tears gone. So it's just a new membership. It's not register

01:00:36.540 --> 01:00:38.540
Oh, is it register?

01:00:41.020 --> 01:00:44.540
Oh no, this can't be wait, how am I supposed to?

01:00:47.180 --> 01:00:50.780
Oh, wow, so it's not even telling me if it's an upgrade now

01:00:51.100 --> 01:00:55.820
Okay, this is good membership not showing in your stream elements as a bug with your stream elements account

01:00:56.780 --> 01:00:58.780
I've contacted their support of

01:00:59.180 --> 01:01:03.260
Okay, I wonder if because stream elements is for twitch really

01:01:05.100 --> 01:01:09.900
Um, but thank you so much everyone for upgrading or becoming a member of the tier. I actually

01:01:10.940 --> 01:01:13.500
Can't remember if I've said around them

01:01:14.220 --> 01:01:19.020
I thought we can just send it you're more professional than many streamers you treat us like humans

01:01:19.340 --> 01:01:22.140
Who streams it doesn't treat you like a human?

01:01:22.700 --> 01:01:23.900
What?

01:01:23.900 --> 01:01:27.180
Please tell me there's not actually streamers like that. I remember

01:01:27.740 --> 01:01:34.460
When uh, you guys taught me that people get actually jealous like if they see you in someone else's chat and I'm like

01:01:35.340 --> 01:01:36.220
Huh?

01:01:36.220 --> 01:01:40.780
That's real because I thought you guys were memeing on me like teaching me this and I'm like wait

01:01:41.180 --> 01:01:45.420
Some some vtubers expect you to solely watch them and only then

01:01:46.220 --> 01:01:49.660
Um, the it was very eye-opening very

01:01:52.140 --> 01:01:54.220
Boy, thank you for the tip alert this

01:01:54.220 --> 01:01:58.300
Yeah, for some reason I can see that on stream elements, but nothing else

01:01:58.380 --> 01:02:02.620
I can see if someone gifts membership on stream elements as well, but that's it

01:02:05.180 --> 01:02:09.100
Some people are a bit cray-cray about it. Hmm. I see be sweating right now

01:02:10.220 --> 01:02:15.180
That was that was slightly different. I understand where she said that. Yeah, it's a lot more common than you think

01:02:16.060 --> 01:02:18.060
I'm only gonna have time for you to try

01:02:18.700 --> 01:02:20.700
My 12 hour streams. Yeah

01:02:20.700 --> 01:02:22.700
Oh

01:02:22.780 --> 01:02:24.780
Thank you for the gifted membership

01:02:25.340 --> 01:02:27.500
Uh, I poor thank you

01:02:29.180 --> 01:02:34.220
You oh you need to allow gifts. There may be a prompt in chat right now to allow gifts

01:02:35.180 --> 01:02:42.460
Uh, make sure you click it. I think you it will say that you can receive gifts

01:02:43.740 --> 01:02:45.740
I don't know how it works

01:02:46.060 --> 01:02:53.100
My membership just got refunded. Did I miss something? Yes, I had to change the price because gifted membership

01:02:53.820 --> 01:02:55.660
um

01:02:55.740 --> 01:02:57.260
is

01:02:57.260 --> 01:03:03.980
Was the wrong price. So thank you everyone who's resubbing. I believe you got a refund question mark question mark

01:03:04.620 --> 01:03:06.620
Which is really good

01:03:16.380 --> 01:03:22.940
Yeah, we all got refunded that was really quick. Honestly shout out to youtube if everyone literally got refunded that was so quick

01:03:24.140 --> 01:03:27.980
Where is the join button on mobile? Get right. You're on mobile. There is no join button

01:03:28.700 --> 01:03:33.420
It's just a mystery the join button's more of a suggestion than actual rules

01:03:35.420 --> 01:03:39.100
And thank you everyone for resubbing. I'm so sorry, uh

01:03:39.820 --> 01:03:43.500
D. W. Thank you for subbing giving kids any con

01:03:44.380 --> 01:03:45.740
Sula's

01:03:45.740 --> 01:03:47.740
loli wika

01:03:49.340 --> 01:03:54.300
Asterix I'm like pretty sure I've said all these names before. I'm so sorry to anyone whose name I haven't said before

01:03:55.260 --> 01:03:57.260
The join button is on the youtube page

01:03:58.220 --> 01:04:00.220
Oh, if you want my youtube page, apparently

01:04:00.220 --> 01:04:09.660
You guys have such funny gamer tags, honestly

01:04:13.180 --> 01:04:18.860
Sorry, I meant 21 so for 21 days not all at once was in a rush to a brain loss for about to clarify

01:04:18.860 --> 01:04:20.860
Okay, I was gonna say that was quite the length

01:04:21.180 --> 01:04:27.020
Being inspired by the 21 days of brushing mean the micro plastics will be purged. Oh, that's okay. I like that

01:04:27.740 --> 01:04:31.740
I subscribed on desktop with PayPal on the old 499. So what now

01:04:32.300 --> 01:04:38.620
You should youtube should have already refunded you apparently apparently everyone already got refunded like within seconds

01:04:39.340 --> 01:04:40.460
um

01:04:40.460 --> 01:04:44.780
So the new tier is one dollar more due to the fact that gifted membership

01:04:45.980 --> 01:04:53.100
Will go to emote tier which was what I wanted, but I was so stubborn and like oh, yeah youtube

01:04:54.060 --> 01:04:56.700
I'm sure youtube will make sure that you can't deny

01:04:58.140 --> 01:05:03.900
Streams at that price, but no no youtube insistent youtube insistent

01:05:06.540 --> 01:05:09.580
Uh a PayPal alerted me about spending it should

01:05:10.380 --> 01:05:12.700
Vtuber foot connoisseur. Thank you

01:05:14.220 --> 01:05:19.580
What a name what a name to show up in this stream with

01:05:20.300 --> 01:05:26.700
What a name. Thank you for becoming a member that's hilarious. Mika's biggest fan. I'm thinking

01:05:30.300 --> 01:05:32.300
Art form biscuit. Thank you

01:05:33.020 --> 01:05:37.340
What a name honestly, you like the french tip as a standard for you

01:05:38.220 --> 01:05:43.420
That's right. Where other vtubers don't provide I come swipping in on week one

01:05:44.300 --> 01:05:46.780
Week one. I give you what you seek

01:05:47.660 --> 01:05:50.940
He really is a connoisseur. How's the winded toe doing?

01:05:51.020 --> 01:05:54.780
I'm I had to take painkillers because it's getting a bit sore

01:05:55.660 --> 01:05:58.620
I may or may not be making a doctor's appointment

01:05:59.260 --> 01:06:01.420
About my toe because something

01:06:02.300 --> 01:06:08.300
I'm going to see what happens. I'm going to go for a bath after the stream and let it sweat it out like in the hot water

01:06:09.580 --> 01:06:11.340
in vultkine

01:06:11.340 --> 01:06:13.340
black blood

01:06:14.220 --> 01:06:16.220
Through

01:06:16.540 --> 01:06:21.020
I still forgot this is week one. I mean technical. Well, we're just entered week two I guess but

01:06:21.660 --> 01:06:26.300
If youtube stats updated immediately, we would have been monetized day one

01:06:26.540 --> 01:06:31.900
But it took a whole week for it to thinking this is week two my apology fee. Yes fee

01:06:32.220 --> 01:06:37.340
I'm so sorry if you don't like immersion breaking although I am literally as white as my

01:06:37.980 --> 01:06:41.500
I'm actually I'm so white. I'm transparent. What the heck did I just move there?

01:06:41.580 --> 01:06:45.980
Well, I think like you can literally see my veins and like the blue if you didn't know

01:06:46.460 --> 01:06:50.700
Veins are blue and they carry deoxygenated blood back to your heart

01:06:51.340 --> 01:06:53.180
They also have blip back

01:06:53.180 --> 01:06:56.700
blow valves which are really good that stops the blood from

01:06:58.460 --> 01:07:04.860
Going backwards in your system because if your blood ever goes backwards, that's very very very bad

01:07:05.420 --> 01:07:09.020
And yeah, you're probably not going to make it if your blood starts going back

01:07:09.980 --> 01:07:15.980
Strongest parallelism and we're like, yes, and then your arteries are what the little red veins are hold the redness

01:07:16.060 --> 01:07:18.620
That's pushing oxygenated blood to

01:07:19.420 --> 01:07:24.460
Where it's needed and then your circulatory system takes care of the rest. It's really quick. That's me

01:07:24.780 --> 01:07:29.180
I could also talk about the heart if you like today. Thank you for signing up

01:07:29.740 --> 01:07:34.540
Oh, you've got a banding of Isaac. That's uh, uh, what what's that x?

01:07:35.260 --> 01:07:37.260
Uh, the fucking loser one

01:07:37.820 --> 01:07:39.660
That's a

01:07:39.660 --> 01:07:41.660
sass and fries

01:07:41.740 --> 01:07:44.780
That's swine up. You guys really poke them on in video game

01:07:45.580 --> 01:07:52.220
Uh pictures as quick as well. Thank you for signing out. Your feet are beautiful. Don't worry things. Yeah, you like you like seeing the

01:07:52.540 --> 01:07:54.540
deoxygenated blood pumping through these veins

01:07:54.620 --> 01:07:56.620
Um

01:08:00.700 --> 01:08:05.580
I can't wait for you to play binding of Isaac November. I'm just warning you all right now

01:08:06.380 --> 01:08:13.340
November is when binding of Isaac's 10 year anniversary is and molly player is unlocked

01:08:13.820 --> 01:08:19.740
I am not going to be off that from you can see my hands in the shadow. I am I am instructing you

01:08:20.700 --> 01:08:27.580
I am not going to be off that game for a very long time. Okay

01:08:28.220 --> 01:08:30.220
Do you understand we play?

01:08:30.460 --> 01:08:33.980
And then you all say I understand mummy and unison, okay?

01:08:34.540 --> 01:08:39.260
We're going to be playing multiplayer Isaac all day long multiple days

01:08:39.980 --> 01:08:45.180
I might even I might even commit to a week and alienate more people

01:08:46.300 --> 01:08:48.300
with my binding of Isaac

01:08:49.260 --> 01:08:55.180
Just so you understand better. Thank you for signing off. Thank you. I understand. I understand mommy. I understand mommy

01:08:55.340 --> 01:09:00.860
I understand. Yes. Good grieflings. Good grieflings. You will be rewarded for your

01:09:01.500 --> 01:09:07.420
Uh, oh wait, so I didn't really so much my shadow was like cast you over you will be rewarded

01:09:08.940 --> 01:09:12.940
Wait, if you can see my shadow, no, we'll do that in a membership. So

01:09:13.980 --> 01:09:15.980
That was a very bad idea. That was a terrible idea

01:09:16.940 --> 01:09:22.220
Little ears, please let me pick up this this q-tip or this ear cleaner as we say

01:09:23.500 --> 01:09:25.500
Let me just pick up this ear cleaner

01:09:30.220 --> 01:09:32.220
Just need to hold it like a bit

01:09:37.740 --> 01:09:40.220
Put it there we go, right you ready for some ear cleaning

01:09:40.940 --> 01:09:47.180
Oh, poor you see if you get trapped water in your ear, don't worry too much your ear can expel it at a later time

01:09:47.980 --> 01:09:49.020
and

01:09:49.020 --> 01:09:55.660
Some people actually find that expelling of the water in your ear quite. Oh wait, you can't even see me touch the

01:09:56.940 --> 01:10:00.220
This is right. I'm going to do a basic

01:10:01.180 --> 01:10:03.180
101

01:10:04.780 --> 01:10:09.980
I'm going to show you a basic 101 for any ASMR is that's watching right now. Okay

01:10:10.460 --> 01:10:13.340
And I know this is very hypocritical because I've just bashed the ear about

01:10:13.900 --> 01:10:17.420
I'm going to teach you this right now live. Okay

01:10:19.900 --> 01:10:21.900
You see this ear

01:10:21.900 --> 01:10:23.900
Inside this ear this black section

01:10:24.540 --> 01:10:27.980
This is what you don't do. Okay. This is what you don't do

01:10:40.220 --> 01:10:42.220
You

01:10:43.740 --> 01:10:48.540
No, no ASMR is you go around the microphone

01:10:49.900 --> 01:10:52.220
Around gently, okay

01:10:55.020 --> 01:10:59.340
Don't don't ever don't ever touch this bit here

01:11:00.140 --> 01:11:05.340
That's the microphone. Okay, but go around the ear

01:11:06.460 --> 01:11:08.460
Gentle

01:11:08.620 --> 01:11:10.620
Gentle gentle gentle gentle

01:11:21.980 --> 01:11:24.540
Okay, there 101 is more

01:11:29.980 --> 01:11:33.900
This I'm gonna try and avoid doing with the tool

01:11:34.140 --> 01:11:41.100
I just around the ear you don't need to go inside. No, no, no, no, I know I know you guys like to rush into it

01:11:41.100 --> 01:11:45.100
Okay, why are you covered in band-aids? I caught myself making food

01:11:47.100 --> 01:11:49.660
I hurt myself on my fingy

01:11:50.620 --> 01:11:52.620
I'm glad to put a band-aid on

01:11:53.260 --> 01:11:56.380
I'm I'm a bit of which is known as a klutz

01:11:56.380 --> 01:12:01.100
Uh, thank you. I had nothing

01:12:01.660 --> 01:12:04.380
Dried my karma the terminator above of the great

01:12:16.300 --> 01:12:19.820
Does that mean you were making food with your foot? No this

01:12:20.700 --> 01:12:23.660
I got all my toes done at the same time

01:12:24.620 --> 01:12:30.780
But this part so when you get your toes done they take clippers and they they take this like push thing

01:12:30.860 --> 01:12:33.020
They like pushed all my like

01:12:33.020 --> 01:12:34.860
Toe skin back and stuff

01:12:34.860 --> 01:12:40.540
But this section on this toe she has cut that was actually kind of sore touching that I'm not even gonna lie

01:12:41.260 --> 01:12:44.700
She cut and sliced into it as she was cutting my toenail

01:12:45.260 --> 01:12:48.220
Um, and it's quite sore and I'm not really sure what to do

01:12:48.700 --> 01:12:50.300
and

01:12:50.300 --> 01:12:52.620
I've not really experienced such a problem before

01:12:53.340 --> 01:12:56.300
But we will we'll we say I think we'll be okay

01:12:58.380 --> 01:13:00.380
Thank you star killer for becoming a

01:13:02.300 --> 01:13:04.300
Do you use a new fluffy instead?

01:13:11.980 --> 01:13:15.180
Wait a minute, I got a thicken tiny

01:13:15.980 --> 01:13:22.780
It seems like you forgot for the next one in from yesterday spain II lol

01:13:23.820 --> 01:13:29.420
Spain II that's what I said. Anyway, I'm off to work Celia and congrats on monetization. Thank you for the tip and yes

01:13:29.740 --> 01:13:31.740
Thank you spain II

01:13:31.980 --> 01:13:35.660
You could literally hear me like be scared to say it because I say it wrong all the time

01:13:36.860 --> 01:13:38.860
Strani, do you have a stethoscope?

01:13:39.260 --> 01:13:41.260
No, I don't

01:13:41.820 --> 01:13:46.780
That would be quite the prop for a smart honestly having a stethoscope

01:13:48.140 --> 01:13:53.740
Uh, you push back the cuticle of the nail bed cleaner, but the actual tool lining is not a cuticle

01:13:54.300 --> 01:13:56.300
You should probably get it to like muckers

01:13:57.500 --> 01:14:02.220
This is great, but I have class now. Okay, would you like class get educated get educated get educated get through well

01:14:02.860 --> 01:14:04.860
Epsom salt foot bath

01:14:04.940 --> 01:14:09.900
Yeah, I think I might do something like that because it's a weirdo

01:14:11.500 --> 01:14:14.780
I heard someone say use it for heart beat ASMR. Oh

01:14:15.660 --> 01:14:17.660
Would that even work? I don't know if we tried

01:14:18.460 --> 01:14:23.180
I wouldn't mind buying that prop. I will buy that prop with my membership money. Thank you

01:14:26.220 --> 01:14:32.140
I hope we're through here. Yeah, I think we'll be fine, right? Sorry. Let me look at the Q questions on marshmallow

01:14:33.660 --> 01:14:40.700
Uh, congrats on the membership. You're the goodest girl around. What is your favorite meal to eat savory something savory?

01:14:42.060 --> 01:14:45.980
Hello, will patreon subs get to see the membership streams on patreon?

01:14:45.980 --> 01:14:51.980
Nope, they are two different subscriptions patreon and youtube activity are two separate things

01:14:52.620 --> 01:14:55.020
So if you're interested in seeing your

01:14:55.740 --> 01:15:00.940
Your girl and your oh she deaths live then that is more youtube orientated

01:15:01.340 --> 01:15:06.620
If you're interested in the alternative content that any member at valer offers, that is what is on patreon

01:15:08.140 --> 01:15:10.140
Thank you for your question

01:15:11.260 --> 01:15:14.220
You have big feet for a woman. Okay

01:15:16.620 --> 01:15:19.980
I don't know what you want me to do with that. You might sign up for basketball

01:15:20.460 --> 01:15:23.660
Right. Sorry. Let me just end the stream. I'm going to contact nba

01:15:24.460 --> 01:15:29.740
Big feet. You think I have big feet. Are you sure it's not perspective because you have nothing else to judge?

01:15:31.500 --> 01:15:36.780
Literally what big feet is good. Your feet are great. Literally everyone's been saying my feet are cute and stuff

01:15:36.780 --> 01:15:39.180
And then you come here. You're like, yeah, your feet are massive. I'm sorry

01:15:39.180 --> 01:15:44.220
Do you want me to bind them like we're in fucking china or something like back when they used to bind the lowest feet?

01:15:44.220 --> 01:15:47.900
Is that we want you want a little fucking lowest feet? Get out of here with that shit

01:15:50.060 --> 01:15:52.700
I don't know anything about food, but they're normal me. Yeah

01:15:55.900 --> 01:15:57.900
Like oh, sorry, excuse me

01:15:58.060 --> 01:16:03.260
Oh, I see when I spawned in uh when I spawned in I actually picked this foot size manually

01:16:03.260 --> 01:16:07.420
You know, there's a little slider bar and everything banana for scale. I don't even have bananas

01:16:08.300 --> 01:16:12.860
Oh, do you want this do you want my stoop waffle that I ate yesterday for scale?

01:16:13.500 --> 01:16:15.500
There there's your scale

01:16:15.980 --> 01:16:17.980
Your fear

01:16:18.300 --> 01:16:22.380
I've no sense of permanent. So I'm just going to assume you're a talking therapy. Honestly

01:16:26.140 --> 01:16:30.380
Who said that who I don't know what feet size are you I actually don't know

01:16:31.420 --> 01:16:33.180
um

01:16:33.580 --> 01:16:38.060
I've not bought a boat. When did I buy a new pair of shoes? I've completely forgot

01:16:38.300 --> 01:16:42.780
I had to get measured for them actually when I got a new pair of shoes because I didn't know what my shoe size is

01:16:48.300 --> 01:16:53.580
Uh, I don't know what to say here to be honest, but I'm glad for she be uh, don't remember

01:16:54.060 --> 01:17:00.220
She's really cute and the gap was really nice. Sorry strongy and uh, the year long wait was worth it. Oh, I'm glad you think so

01:17:03.420 --> 01:17:08.540
Some people were asking like weren't you worried about like everyone being disappointed after a year's wait and I'm like

01:17:09.340 --> 01:17:13.820
I'm sorry, but if you're if you're a leaflin, you knew what you knew we were mean

01:17:14.060 --> 01:17:16.780
You knew I was rambling. You knew exactly what was going on

01:17:17.660 --> 01:17:21.180
Merci, when are you doing about your membership stream for no particular reason?

01:17:22.220 --> 01:17:24.220

You have thank you for signing up your profile picture around to me

01:17:40.460 --> 01:17:44.940
I could have bought a freaking hip no thing and put it on the floor and hypnotize people to my feet

01:17:44.940 --> 01:17:46.940
I'm doing so funny though

01:17:58.060 --> 01:18:01.660
We're squishing the ball we're going back to squishing the ball. It's so easy to squish a ball

01:18:08.700 --> 01:18:12.940
Feet cam feet stream q&a. Will you ever beat the peeler allegations?

01:18:13.900 --> 01:18:15.900
I don't think so

01:18:17.580 --> 01:18:19.820
I was gonna um

01:18:19.820 --> 01:18:22.460
So when the girl started posting it for free

01:18:22.940 --> 01:18:27.420
I was like, oh, I was gonna do a donut on reward where I wrap my 3d open

01:18:27.980 --> 01:18:29.580
like a poly bag

01:18:29.580 --> 01:18:31.100
like a plastic bag

01:18:31.100 --> 01:18:32.220
and

01:18:32.220 --> 01:18:35.660
Hypnotizing the reefing to your feet to convince them I worship the feet honestly

01:18:36.220 --> 01:18:40.860
Goes in a strong a stream your feet are big good for gathering produce all day giley

01:18:41.580 --> 01:18:43.740
Literally, I was like, I've never seen you in my life

01:18:48.380 --> 01:18:51.020
And now you want to do it for free? Yeah

01:18:51.900 --> 01:18:55.740
I was gonna make it a fun donut on work because I was gonna do it on 3d. Oh mate

01:18:56.620 --> 01:19:00.140
But I need to wrap it up to make sure it doesn't you know short circuit

01:19:01.100 --> 01:19:02.060
um

01:19:02.060 --> 01:19:04.540
Was this a bit being in a bag might need that stream

01:19:05.500 --> 01:19:10.780
Hey on reefing on what pee pee's on you

01:19:17.820 --> 01:19:19.820
You still can

01:19:22.060 --> 01:19:27.580
3d moment as terrible honestly. Oh my like donut on plans are absolutely outrageous

01:19:27.980 --> 01:19:29.980
So I was like, hi, love you. That's all

01:19:30.380 --> 01:19:31.580
Really

01:19:31.580 --> 01:19:34.860
So says pokemon or digimon. Sorry. I only saw pokemon

01:19:35.580 --> 01:19:41.020
I never got into digimon because wasn't it wasn't the digimon meme that's literally like

01:19:42.460 --> 01:19:44.140
Oh

01:19:44.140 --> 01:19:48.300
This like cute adorable thing ends up developing like an ak-47

01:19:50.060 --> 01:19:53.100
And like a galeel on one arm a famous on the other

01:19:56.140 --> 01:19:58.860
The only big thing strenny has is her

01:20:00.540 --> 01:20:04.940
Her her heart she has a really big heart

01:20:06.300 --> 01:20:11.580
Hearing your feet sweat stick to the ball reminds me of ear coughing when the hand leaves the ear

01:20:12.460 --> 01:20:14.780
Stop wait, I think my feet are sweaty enough to do

01:20:16.460 --> 01:20:18.460
What does this sound like?

01:20:29.980 --> 01:20:36.220
Oh, that's great. Oh, you actually like it. Thank you destiny to enjoy, okay

01:20:40.380 --> 01:20:42.380
It sounds nice

01:20:43.180 --> 01:20:48.700
Can I do to it? Can I do both? Hold on. I think I can do joe wield ear cupping

01:20:51.580 --> 01:20:53.580
Oh, sorry, I just peaked the audio

01:20:54.940 --> 01:20:56.940
It's a bit more difficult this way

01:20:57.180 --> 01:21:02.780
It sounds good. Wait, there really are sticking to the ear

01:21:03.020 --> 01:21:08.860
Did you miss the pop rock segment where I proved how sweaty my feet are via pop rocking?

01:21:10.220 --> 01:21:13.740
I just realized the maker swap is it? Oh, no

01:21:17.020 --> 01:21:20.700
Is it on the wrong side I can swap it out manually if you want

01:21:23.660 --> 01:21:25.660
Peaking the audio just means you're peeking

01:21:27.500 --> 01:21:33.900
You want to hear my heartbeat from my foot? I don't know if I can do that

01:21:39.340 --> 01:21:41.340
I don't think you can hear it

01:21:45.260 --> 01:21:47.660
I go here 10 minutes ago. Yeah, the start of the stream

01:21:48.220 --> 01:21:49.580
um

01:21:49.580 --> 01:21:55.500
I may or may not have opened up pop rocks and put them on the soles of my feet to prove how sweaty my feet are

01:21:55.980 --> 01:21:57.740
And they popped

01:21:57.740 --> 01:22:03.580
No outside influence necessary. So I have proven that I do have hypo hydrolysis

01:22:05.020 --> 01:22:11.340
Not that anyone needed proof. I don't know why you would make up such an accusation in all honesty. I would anyone want it

01:22:12.540 --> 01:22:14.460
Thank you

01:22:14.460 --> 01:22:16.460
Glaesos

01:22:19.500 --> 01:22:21.500
Yeah

01:22:25.580 --> 01:22:27.580
So fancy

01:22:29.980 --> 01:22:37.420
I get sweaty feet too. Yeah, uh, just just as a mild warning to anyone who's listening if you have permanent sweaty hands and feet

01:22:38.060 --> 01:22:43.180
Uh, please do consider uh autism. Um, that's all that's my note

01:22:45.660 --> 01:22:48.060
Oh, can we do toe tapping ASMR?

01:22:50.940 --> 01:22:52.940
Oh, yes

01:22:55.740 --> 01:23:04.780
Uh, yes, it's actually a very common satree um of having autism uh by having permanently sweaty hands and feet

01:23:07.340 --> 01:23:11.180
What if you have hairy palms? I don't actually know

01:23:12.140 --> 01:23:14.780
Maybe you're Italian because aren't Italians hairy?

01:23:15.820 --> 01:23:17.820
I am acoustic

01:23:18.460 --> 01:23:21.020
Oh, that explains a lot actually. Yeah

01:23:21.980 --> 01:23:24.700
Yeah, we have strong arism though

01:23:27.180 --> 01:23:33.980
Little toe tapping ASMR, that's right. That's right average vtuber recharged thousands for this in a donut stall on me

01:23:34.140 --> 01:23:36.140
You get it for free

01:23:37.340 --> 01:23:42.300
I never noticed it until you actually mentioned it, but yeah, I do have autism and sweaty hands and feet

01:23:42.300 --> 01:23:46.220
Yeah, it's a very common trait. Um another sub if you are

01:23:46.940 --> 01:23:48.700
um

01:23:48.700 --> 01:23:51.900
Depending on the scale, however you want to scale you can do it different ways

01:23:51.980 --> 01:23:55.340
But if you are on kind of like the high needs side of autism

01:23:55.420 --> 01:24:01.500
Um, if you do toe walking only that is a massive indicator a humongous indicator

01:24:01.900 --> 01:24:06.620
That you are kind of on the upper uh scale of the prison needs. Thank you

01:24:07.340 --> 01:24:08.860
gin

01:24:08.860 --> 01:24:10.860
Isuru channel

01:24:10.860 --> 01:24:12.860
And thank you

01:24:13.180 --> 01:24:15.180
So cracks

01:24:17.500 --> 01:24:18.860
Uh

01:24:18.860 --> 01:24:23.740
I used to have I have to use antiperspirant on my feet anytime I had otherwise it's blister sitting

01:24:24.060 --> 01:24:26.700
Huh, I never noticed that before but you're right about the sweaty feet. Yeah

01:24:28.860 --> 01:24:34.380
The toe walking is too real toe walking is a humongous indicator that um

01:24:34.940 --> 01:24:37.100
The child that normally it's noticed in childhood

01:24:37.740 --> 01:24:43.740
Um, you can unlearn it as you get older, but it's a massive indicator

01:24:44.540 --> 01:24:49.020
I used to walk all the time. Yes. It is one of the biggest giveaways if a

01:24:50.700 --> 01:24:53.420
Child is autistic basically if they toe walking

01:24:55.340 --> 01:24:57.340
Got used to some powers for goods

01:24:57.740 --> 01:25:01.100
Literally well like without mine like I had um

01:25:02.060 --> 01:25:04.060
Um

01:25:04.780 --> 01:25:09.260
It was stroking my ego. They're like, I don't know how you do it. I don't know how you like stream

01:25:09.900 --> 01:25:11.580
I'm like

01:25:11.580 --> 01:25:15.900
Do I tell them the truth and the reason I can stream all the time is because I have autism

01:25:16.460 --> 01:25:20.940
Or am I just like oh, I'm just really passionate. I just really like what I get to do like

01:25:24.140 --> 01:25:29.260
For me, it's always sitting in weird ways that put so much pressure on my feet that I keep getting callous

01:25:29.500 --> 01:25:30.460
Yeah

01:25:30.460 --> 01:25:34.940
I told run is that similar told running maybe isn't the biggest indicator

01:25:35.500 --> 01:25:38.620
And in children, but then like you can start like it's

01:25:39.580 --> 01:25:41.580
She's unstoppable

01:25:41.820 --> 01:25:45.900
And I walked on toes as a child and then my feet are

01:25:47.180 --> 01:25:49.580
Don't don't be shy. You can finish the rest of your sentence

01:25:50.940 --> 01:25:53.180
We don't bite here. We don't bite from around these books

01:25:53.260 --> 01:25:55.260
I got

01:26:06.220 --> 01:26:13.100
This is enough to what else can I do I freaking I've brought this stick in some people like wouldn't stick a somewhere

01:26:13.180 --> 01:26:18.700
I've never particularly found it easy to record it. So the only thing I can do really is just tapping

01:26:19.420 --> 01:26:21.420
like on the ear

01:26:23.900 --> 01:26:25.900
Oh

01:26:26.300 --> 01:26:30.300
Any other major indications of autism? There's tons like

01:26:31.580 --> 01:26:34.940
Stimming with hands lack of eye contact is a big one

01:26:35.500 --> 01:26:37.100
and

01:26:37.100 --> 01:26:42.540
My biggest question to you if you're like sitting here and you're like hold on a minute. She's starting to she's spitting the truth

01:26:43.260 --> 01:26:46.220
My biggest question if you genuinely are like, huh is

01:26:47.020 --> 01:26:49.180
How different would the world look if

01:26:49.980 --> 01:26:54.700
If everyone thought like you how different would the world look if everyone thought like you and before you're like

01:26:54.700 --> 01:27:00.380
That's not an indication. Just think about it a bit more. Okay, just think a wee bit deeper into that question

01:27:00.380 --> 01:27:02.380
Okay

01:27:05.180 --> 01:27:09.100
Anyway gifts are messed up everyone's getting tier two one dollar

01:27:10.780 --> 01:27:12.780
For something we really wanted so why

01:27:16.380 --> 01:27:18.780
One more dollar for something we really wanted so why

01:27:19.900 --> 01:27:21.900
Why was that because

01:27:26.700 --> 01:27:30.140
Oh wait, is this an old sorry, this may be an old message

01:27:33.180 --> 01:27:35.180
Sorry, I'm reading

01:27:35.980 --> 01:27:39.100
I'm so happy to have you back. I miss you so much. I miss you too a lot recently

01:27:40.060 --> 01:27:45.180
Okay. Yeah, sorry. Those were old ones talking about the tier. Thank you for anyone's info about the teams

01:27:45.180 --> 01:27:47.180
Uh

01:27:47.420 --> 01:27:49.740
World ends up addicted to watching veal

01:27:51.500 --> 01:27:57.020
That's how we take over you guys thought my hypnosis was to drown you all. No, it was to

01:27:58.860 --> 01:28:00.860
Oh my god, my feet are so tall

01:28:03.180 --> 01:28:05.180
I'll put your mops on to protect you because

01:28:09.900 --> 01:28:11.900
I can get a bit from it

01:28:12.780 --> 01:28:14.780
Uh

01:28:15.420 --> 01:28:17.420
Right, let's see where we are

01:28:19.500 --> 01:28:22.540
What strongy you're the strongest at least mentally

01:28:22.540 --> 01:28:27.820
I don't know about physically me who struggled to open a can of fizzy juice on the hand cam stream

01:28:30.140 --> 01:28:33.660
Can I buy or use band-aids to put on an alt or um

01:28:34.300 --> 01:28:39.980
This one literally has gunk on it. I don't I don't know what's going on this tool, but we'll figure we'll figure it out

01:28:40.940 --> 01:28:42.940
Uh girl I've ever known

01:28:44.220 --> 01:28:49.740
But someone like you should never mess with infections get that tool checked ASAP. Oh monk. Yes, okay

01:28:50.380 --> 01:28:54.860
If you had to take painkillers, you can go the ER, but I know you'll never do it because you're a sweetheart

01:28:54.860 --> 01:28:56.620
but somebody else could

01:28:56.620 --> 01:29:00.060
Sue that pedicure. Oh no, she didn't mean it

01:29:00.540 --> 01:29:06.700
You should at least show them the medical papers you get from the hospital monk. Yes. Am I going to the hospital because I'm a toad

01:29:07.260 --> 01:29:12.220
I'll tell you what I'll update you some twitter after my bath

01:29:12.540 --> 01:29:16.860
I'll do a soul plingy and see what happens because so so normally

01:29:17.100 --> 01:29:19.100
and it makes out

01:29:19.740 --> 01:29:25.020
Would you be playing and would you be interested in playing omega strikers on stream? It's a 3v3

01:29:26.140 --> 01:29:29.900
mob style air hockey that's free to play. Oh my god. That sounds fun

01:29:30.860 --> 01:29:32.860
Omega strikers

01:29:32.940 --> 01:29:34.940

Thank you. Whoa, and thank you panel

01:29:39.980 --> 01:29:41.980

Oh, no, the mega strikers look so cool

01:29:46.700 --> 01:29:48.700
All their waifus are cute

01:29:50.300 --> 01:29:54.540
Isn't this free to play? Oh, no, it's nintendo

01:29:56.620 --> 01:29:58.620
Oh, no

01:29:58.940 --> 01:30:00.940
It's nintendo

01:30:01.420 --> 01:30:03.420
Nintendo so expensive

01:30:03.900 --> 01:30:05.900
Is it nintendo?

01:30:11.340 --> 01:30:17.100
Oh, yeah, oh, no, this can't be this can't be it can't be nintendo. What is this a nintendo noton now?

01:30:18.540 --> 01:30:23.180
Uh, it's on pc. Okay. It's on pc. Right. Oh, okay. Okay. It's fine. It's fine

01:30:23.180 --> 01:30:29.100
It's fine if it's on pc. It can't be overcharged that much if anything is specifically published by nintendo

01:30:29.260 --> 01:30:33.500
Just know you're gonna get rinsed out ours for the price. It's absolutely ridiculous. Whoa

Thank you so much for the 20 gifted. Thank you and congrats everyone who called up their face

01:31:14.460 --> 01:31:16.460
It's all coming together

01:31:17.260 --> 01:31:20.140
Yes, you'll have to like I think you have to talk in chat

01:31:20.300 --> 01:31:25.420
Even if you just say a simple message like hi, and then it'll be like you could have got this enable it

01:31:31.260 --> 01:31:36.700
I love you. Will you go on a date with me? You better come to the convention. I'm giving everyone roses

01:31:37.660 --> 01:31:40.380
I think if we ever did like an actual convention

01:31:41.180 --> 01:31:45.420
I'd love to buy like single roses so I can give it out and I'd be like, ha, that's right

01:31:45.820 --> 01:31:50.380
You have beat all the odds of a man never receiving a flower before he

01:31:53.500 --> 01:31:55.500
All right, hold on. Let me hydrate let me hydrate

01:32:03.580 --> 01:32:06.940
What convention where no, there's been no picked convention

01:32:07.660 --> 01:32:12.860
But I really want to try it once in my life. I've never been to a convention before

01:32:13.180 --> 01:32:18.060
I've never been to like a location that has been self identified for nerds

01:32:18.700 --> 01:32:19.660
um

01:32:19.660 --> 01:32:21.420
And dorks like us

01:32:21.420 --> 01:32:27.580
So it would be a very unique experience. Wow. That's like literally real-time assigning

01:32:28.540 --> 01:32:31.580
Um gifted memberships. That's crazy

01:32:33.260 --> 01:32:35.260
That's so cool. Um

01:32:35.420 --> 01:32:37.420
Vial or conno

01:32:37.740 --> 01:32:44.540
Well, the only thing is I have absolutely crippling traveling anxiety, which is a bit of a problem

01:32:45.500 --> 01:32:48.540
There's a big convention in california. I think

01:32:49.180 --> 01:32:54.540
And a lot of the girls would actually be able to make it manually. I think if we all went but

01:32:56.300 --> 01:32:58.300
I don't want to let the team down

01:32:59.500 --> 01:33:02.300
There's a lot of issues about getting on a plane

01:33:02.940 --> 01:33:10.220
Um, and I get violently motion sick as well. This is why I just want to farm with

01:33:11.180 --> 01:33:18.220
You refling because I can't travel anywhere. I get so sick like I had to get a taxi

01:33:19.820 --> 01:33:27.180
I think a taxi to my dentist appointment and I it's not even that far away from me. I was violently ill. I was like

01:33:27.500 --> 01:33:28.700
Oh

01:33:28.700 --> 01:33:32.380
I was like, can I just put the window down and the guy's like, yeah, yeah

01:33:32.460 --> 01:33:35.980
He's like on his phone talking to his pal and all that. I'm getting scared

01:33:37.020 --> 01:33:39.020
Oh

01:33:39.260 --> 01:33:43.420
I'm gonna use thank you narrow for becoming a member. I can see that

01:33:44.140 --> 01:33:46.700
Get drunk and pass out on the plane. Honestly

01:33:48.380 --> 01:33:52.300
I got I will be so high on medication. See the problem is I don't want to be like

01:33:52.380 --> 01:33:54.380
I'm definitely going to a convention

01:33:54.620 --> 01:33:59.260
Because I have a bomb and a bomb really messes up things that happen in real life

01:33:59.260 --> 01:34:05.100
And I don't want to be like, oh, you should go to this convention in melbourne for this on this day at this time

01:34:05.260 --> 01:34:10.620
I'll be here because I don't want anyone to spend money to come out on the the sole reason to come

01:34:11.020 --> 01:34:13.020
Like see me type thing

01:34:13.020 --> 01:34:16.300
Because if my freaking a bomb gets in the way

01:34:17.260 --> 01:34:18.140
I

01:34:18.140 --> 01:34:22.540
Oh, wait, I'll tell it. I'll tell it in another stream. Okay, but I have a really freaking

01:34:23.100 --> 01:34:25.740
It's really frustrating, but it's quite humorous at the same time

01:34:25.900 --> 01:34:30.940
But yeah, you could be the one of those robots that meet up. Yeah, that's possible first mercy next round

01:34:30.940 --> 01:34:32.940
Do other girls have motion sickness?

01:34:33.500 --> 01:34:37.900
Oh, no, I can still play video games. I have like travel motion sickness

01:34:38.860 --> 01:34:43.420
Like a parent. Oh, wait. No, she put those goofy goggles on her eyes. I'm pretty sure she did

01:34:44.140 --> 01:34:48.140
No, you're right about mercy. She put those funny goggles on her eyes

01:34:50.860 --> 01:34:55.740
What is a bomb a bomb stands for anxiety because people are sick of hearing about it

01:34:56.140 --> 01:34:59.820
Like the word anxiety. So I just call it a bomb as a substitute

01:35:00.620 --> 01:35:01.420
um

01:35:01.420 --> 01:35:03.420
It's ear problems

01:35:03.420 --> 01:35:08.460
Oh, well, I can fix your ear problems with my sweaty feet. Oh, yes

01:35:08.460 --> 01:35:12.780
Oh, yes, you can handle that. Can't you? So a little tool rubbing ASMR?

01:35:14.060 --> 01:35:15.660
Yeah

01:35:15.660 --> 01:35:17.660
That's right

01:35:18.620 --> 01:35:23.900
Maybe don't say that in airport. Oh, no. Yeah, we we're not going to use that terminology

01:35:26.380 --> 01:35:29.180
I think stronti can fix their ear problems on her page

01:35:32.060 --> 01:35:34.060
I mean your motion sickness. Sorry

01:35:34.060 --> 01:35:42.060
Do you take game suggestions? I absolutely do. I have absolutely no issues. Um

01:35:42.700 --> 01:35:45.260
A lot of streamers kind of don't

01:35:46.060 --> 01:35:53.020
No, that's not nice. I will not generalize. Please. Don't be afraid to gap her bucket. Thank you for becoming a member

01:35:53.820 --> 01:35:57.180
and please don't be afraid to you don't ask me questions or

01:35:57.900 --> 01:36:01.900
Um game suggestions are perfectly fine with me. I have no problems

01:36:02.700 --> 01:36:04.700
and

01:36:05.260 --> 01:36:09.660
It's that how many people use a bomb as a word for being male to interpret. Yes, like I

01:36:12.860 --> 01:36:16.220
I kind of generally touch up on the subject

01:36:16.780 --> 01:36:19.500
Just because like I am very thankful to be where I am

01:36:20.060 --> 01:36:21.820
versus where I was

01:36:21.820 --> 01:36:26.780
And but I feel like people are so tired and burned out hearing about it and like, oh, everyone's got it

01:36:26.780 --> 01:36:29.100
And I'm like, yeah, I need wonder everyone's got it. Have you seen

01:36:29.820 --> 01:36:35.660
Have you seen society today? We live in a society. No wonder everyone's gone up. Anyway, we can do that

01:36:36.060 --> 01:36:41.100
I can talk about that in another stream. This stream is supposed to be me celebrating monetization

01:36:41.340 --> 01:36:45.020
And yet again, I'm talking about the how that we need the downfall of society. It's terrible

01:36:45.500 --> 01:36:47.500
It's shocking

01:36:47.900 --> 01:36:52.540
And we got his dempa in here. No way dempa is in here staring at my toes right now. Oh god. She is

01:36:54.140 --> 01:36:57.340
Hi dempa. I have no idea what size my feet are

01:36:57.740 --> 01:37:02.540
I bought like new shoes last year and they had to measure them and I already forgot

01:37:03.260 --> 01:37:05.260
My shoes aren't in this room

01:37:06.220 --> 01:37:09.740
Sorry dempa. I had to be this way. I literally am

01:37:14.460 --> 01:37:18.620
Yeah, dempa, you should do foot cam ASMR with me. You want to you want to come over?

01:37:20.380 --> 01:37:24.540
I feel like you would have smaller toes than me. I've never had a pedicure before

01:37:24.780 --> 01:37:30.620
Oh, well, if you ever get one, just make sure they don't mess up your toe by the way because mine's an agony. So

01:37:31.740 --> 01:37:33.740
Yeah, you definitely need to be careful with that

01:37:35.660 --> 01:37:37.660
Here's my beefling heart

01:37:37.660 --> 01:37:39.820
The world is uh, there's no surprise

01:37:41.580 --> 01:37:47.020
I have a broken pinky though. Oh, no. Can you know like spread your little look at my pinky do this little dance?

01:37:47.740 --> 01:37:49.740
Oh

01:37:52.620 --> 01:37:58.860
I don't want someone to touch my feet. I get a massage is very unique sensation

01:37:59.500 --> 01:38:00.860
um

01:38:00.860 --> 01:38:04.700
Very very unique sensation dempa x20 for you ASMR

01:38:07.900 --> 01:38:09.900
Poor dempa's pinky thing

01:38:10.700 --> 01:38:16.940
Are there any game genres you want to avoid? Um, I don't like oh, this is going to be controversial

01:38:17.180 --> 01:38:20.620
I might filter some people with this one. Um, the reason

01:38:21.340 --> 01:38:27.340
I do not like games like resident evil where you give me ammunition, but it does not perish the enemy

01:38:27.660 --> 01:38:35.340
Do not give me enemies that cannot be perished. What is the point in having an ammunition resource management section?

01:38:35.660 --> 01:38:40.620
If it does not perish the big bad enemy, please do not suggest these kinds of games

01:38:41.020 --> 01:38:44.780
It will turn into a rage stream real quick and I will become so scots

01:38:44.780 --> 01:38:50.780
You will not actually be able to understand me. I'm sorry, but do not give me ammunition if it does not perish the enemy

01:38:51.180 --> 01:38:53.500
Simple as I mean that's fair preach

01:38:54.620 --> 01:39:00.540
Did you put hydrogen peroxide on it? No, I'm going to take a bath. I'm going to take this off and go for a bath

01:39:01.260 --> 01:39:02.460
and

01:39:02.460 --> 01:39:04.460
Do salt in the bath

01:39:05.020 --> 01:39:09.580
You mean you like that 30 bullets to kill that one enemy? Yeah

01:39:10.300 --> 01:39:12.300
Yeah

01:39:12.700 --> 01:39:16.220
I'm sure the resident evil games are good. However, I have fantastic news

01:39:16.220 --> 01:39:19.660
I have five gen mates that are more than likely to play that kind of genre

01:39:19.980 --> 01:39:26.220
I've never played resident evil my I watched my dad play resident evil

01:39:26.940 --> 01:39:33.020
And it started off in Africa, but he couldn't even get through it and we were both watching it and we were like

01:39:33.820 --> 01:39:37.980
Well, I was watching him play it and both of us were looking at each other like what is this?

01:39:38.700 --> 01:39:41.100
Like he couldn't get through it. I couldn't get through it

01:39:41.660 --> 01:39:43.180
um

01:39:43.180 --> 01:39:49.260
Oh res fat. Yeah, I was like set in Africa or something like I it was like super hot savannah type thing

01:39:49.980 --> 01:39:51.180
um

01:39:51.180 --> 01:39:56.460
And both of us were just staring at each other like this is the biggest piece that we've ever bought

01:39:56.860 --> 01:39:57.820
um

01:39:57.820 --> 01:40:01.260
Because normally we like play games together or share games together type thing

01:40:01.900 --> 01:40:05.180
You watch your dad play the second worst one. Oh, well, there you go

01:40:05.340 --> 01:40:10.700
Literally, we I think we've got 20 minutes into it. Both of us were looking at each other like yeah, that's that game's going back

01:40:10.700 --> 01:40:12.940
We're gonna hand it in for a different game

01:40:15.820 --> 01:40:20.780
Is there something you've always wanted to try that you've made for 100 games that gave to you?

01:40:23.420 --> 01:40:24.940
I've want to play

01:40:25.980 --> 01:40:27.980
Civ 6

01:40:29.020 --> 01:40:31.020
um

01:40:31.100 --> 01:40:36.380
I have done one run on it and I enjoyed it but I was very dumb and I want to play boulder's game

01:40:36.460 --> 01:40:38.380
I definitely want to try that for the first time

01:40:38.380 --> 01:40:43.260
But I think it will be a patience testing stream because I get worried about playing a game for the first time

01:40:44.300 --> 01:40:46.300
um

01:40:46.700 --> 01:40:49.340
5 and 6 are some of the best sold ones regardless

01:40:50.140 --> 01:40:53.660
Wow, I think for free. I yeah, congrats on monetization

01:40:56.140 --> 01:40:58.140
Uh, let's just make sure

01:40:58.300 --> 01:40:59.900
Right, I think

01:40:59.900 --> 01:41:01.500
um

01:41:01.500 --> 01:41:05.500
As soon as I think your feet are very beautiful. I'm hot. Thanks. Do you have my toes? I got my toes down

01:41:07.740 --> 01:41:09.740
Look at that stepping

01:41:09.740 --> 01:41:15.740
Look at that side profile on the toe spread. Can I just get a zoom in an appreciation for the side profile of toe spread? Yeah

01:41:16.780 --> 01:41:23.260
I mean look at that. You you already know you're welcome. Yeah, you're welcome. You owe me one membership. You're welcome

01:41:23.260 --> 01:41:25.260
Um

01:41:26.700 --> 01:41:32.060
The new boulders gate. Yeah, I've never played the boulders gate. Apparently. Yeah, someone says it's cool. But primary's cool

01:41:34.060 --> 01:41:36.860
That's delicious. You played any rts

01:41:37.820 --> 01:41:40.860
Uh starcraft. No, my dad played it

01:41:41.820 --> 01:41:43.820
age of empires

01:41:44.380 --> 01:41:46.380
Civ 6 is a dumpster fire

01:41:46.620 --> 01:41:47.980
Is that actually

01:41:47.980 --> 01:41:50.620
Didn't they not ren- announcers a new Civ 6?

01:41:51.340 --> 01:41:53.340
Yeah, a new Civ coming out

01:41:56.140 --> 01:42:00.540
Long toes wait, they actually have long toes stop. Do I have long toes?

01:42:01.420 --> 01:42:04.300
There you go. I'm gonna start again. Hold on. I'm gonna get that really right. Hold on

01:42:05.340 --> 01:42:06.540
that

01:42:06.540 --> 01:42:11.980
I don't know. I feel like I have like the toe because you can have like people some people have like toes that oh wait

01:42:11.980 --> 01:42:14.780
Sorry, you can't see any of them. Hold on. Let's try this again

01:42:15.020 --> 01:42:19.660
Some people have toes where they like are all the same length like they come across like that

01:42:20.380 --> 01:42:22.380
minor like

01:42:22.380 --> 01:42:23.260
the

01:42:23.260 --> 01:42:25.660
That shape I don't know if that makes any sense

01:42:26.380 --> 01:42:32.380
You feel cute like your toes are cute. I'm gonna start getting a complex about my freaking toes. Are you joking?

01:42:33.740 --> 01:42:39.900
Right, how long are my toes right? We'll do it in inches because you're all american. You said 2.5 inches is

01:42:40.780 --> 01:42:43.660
Wait, hold on. I'm like trying to show you and do it at the same time

01:42:44.780 --> 01:42:46.780
Where is 2.5?

01:42:46.780 --> 01:42:48.780
Uh

01:42:50.220 --> 01:42:56.140
Where I am my my index toe is just bigger than an inch

01:42:58.620 --> 01:43:06.220
Sorry, I just hit the mic. Oh, you're not american. I'm sorry. Um, um, um, hold on. Uh, okay, roughly

01:43:07.020 --> 01:43:09.020
3 centimeters tall

01:43:09.580 --> 01:43:11.580
About 3 centimeters tall

01:43:11.980 --> 01:43:16.060
I am fended long toe equals more than joy. What the fuck is an inch?

01:43:17.900 --> 01:43:19.900
Three of these baby

01:43:21.580 --> 01:43:25.820
Measure the entire foot. Oh, no, but then you will know I've got big feet

01:43:26.620 --> 01:43:30.860
I did oh no my foot's bigger than the ruler. Like if the ruler goes there, it's like

01:43:32.940 --> 01:43:34.940
If this ruler's 15 centimeters

01:43:35.900 --> 01:43:37.900
Wait, hold on. Let me put it as a thing

01:43:39.660 --> 01:43:46.300
Okay, I put it on my heel and it's there on my toe. So I'm like 16 centimeter feet

01:43:48.140 --> 01:43:50.940
Yeah, sorry, that was like the most known way to do it

01:43:52.460 --> 01:43:54.460
But I did it

01:43:54.860 --> 01:43:56.860
Big feet are good

01:43:58.140 --> 01:44:00.940
But you have no big feet the mic is low

01:44:01.900 --> 01:44:03.900
I don't know. I might have I

01:44:04.140 --> 01:44:09.340
I genuinely thought I was like average on everything. Um, but then when I did the

01:44:10.220 --> 01:44:13.420
Sweet eating cam and everyone saw my hands. You're like, oh, your hands are so small

01:44:13.500 --> 01:44:16.220
But when we started measuring it together, I was like, oh, okay

01:44:20.220 --> 01:44:23.020
Imagine if this is popped right now because I'm a sweetie

01:44:27.100 --> 01:44:29.100
Can you measure how wide you can spread your

01:44:29.820 --> 01:44:33.100
Big toe and the one next to it. We have weight

01:44:34.620 --> 01:44:40.940
Uh, I don't know like because you could like this is that we want to hold on

01:44:43.420 --> 01:44:45.420
Thank you so very sweetie

01:44:48.620 --> 01:44:53.660
Like that or do you mean like the actual foot? I don't know it depends. That has to be malleable

01:44:54.620 --> 01:44:57.100
Uh, this is gross measurement

01:44:57.900 --> 01:45:02.300
It has to be malleable like it has to be like because I can grip stuff like

01:45:03.980 --> 01:45:10.220
I'm gonna just grab my hold on now. Can I move you a little bit? There you go. There you go. Just pop you there and good boy

01:45:11.180 --> 01:45:13.020
head pass

01:45:13.020 --> 01:45:15.020
Uh this

01:45:15.100 --> 01:45:18.460
It depends because like that is you know

01:45:20.140 --> 01:45:22.140
And I can put it in between like

01:45:23.900 --> 01:45:25.900
I

01:45:30.060 --> 01:45:32.460
In the culture she would have nice grippers

01:45:33.340 --> 01:45:38.060
Down her renders and chat. I guess your feet are small, but it makes your toes really long and compact

01:45:38.300 --> 01:45:43.820
No, I'm gonna get a freaking complex after this dream. I don't know. I just thought my feet were really normal

01:45:45.980 --> 01:45:47.980
Oh my cat's me on did you hear him?

01:45:49.740 --> 01:45:51.740
Do you want in

01:45:52.220 --> 01:45:54.700
Did you hear that? Hold on

01:45:56.460 --> 01:45:58.460
Hold on let me get him

01:45:59.180 --> 01:46:00.780
Baby boy

01:46:00.780 --> 01:46:02.780
You want in

01:46:04.140 --> 01:46:06.140
Baby boy

01:46:06.540 --> 01:46:08.060
Vigo

01:46:08.060 --> 01:46:10.060
Vigo you can't even just oh

01:46:10.380 --> 01:46:13.660
Gimli Gimli do you want to do you want to come on stream?

01:46:15.980 --> 01:46:18.940
She's so confused right now. She's like, what are you doing?

01:46:19.740 --> 01:46:21.740
Gimli come here

01:46:22.300 --> 01:46:29.340
Gimli come come right here. Come right here. Show the people how adorable you are. No, that's the wrong way

01:46:30.060 --> 01:46:32.060
Gimli what's this

01:46:32.300 --> 01:46:33.740
Gimmels

01:46:33.740 --> 01:46:40.380
Yes, yes, okay. Just gently don't knock over the webcam. I'll cry Gimli don't knock over it right out

01:46:40.780 --> 01:46:42.780
You're gonna knock the webcam over Gimli

01:46:44.860 --> 01:46:47.420
I've only got 10 more minutes. I'll be out in a minute Gimli

01:46:49.420 --> 01:46:51.420
I didn't get it though

01:46:51.660 --> 01:46:56.620
Give me 10 minutes Gimli just 10 minutes is all in me. Sorry. My tube is sweet to hear that

01:46:58.380 --> 01:47:00.380
Mommy Gimli that was a

01:47:00.700 --> 01:47:06.380
She was so gonna knock over that way of cramps. I was like get out of Gimli. I could tell oh

01:47:07.500 --> 01:47:09.500
Oh, I've done it now haven't I?

01:47:10.620 --> 01:47:12.860
Gimli 10 minutes and I'm

01:47:13.820 --> 01:47:15.820
Stop it

01:47:16.300 --> 01:47:19.180
Your dog is very cute. Thank you

01:47:27.340 --> 01:47:30.300
I'm terrified for eight years. You're for your perfect. Thank you

01:47:31.260 --> 01:47:37.020
Literally, I shouldn't have brought her in because now she's gonna want the attention and I was like, I'm not finished. I'm not finished

01:47:37.500 --> 01:47:39.500
Give me 10 minutes girls

01:47:40.060 --> 01:47:44.220
10 minutes of getting screamed up by a cat. Literally a cat does not understand

01:47:45.100 --> 01:47:47.100
Feet time

01:47:47.980 --> 01:47:50.460
She doesn't have a cat. She has 10 doves

01:47:53.420 --> 01:47:57.820
Yeah, that was my Gimli. I thought it was my baby boy Vigil

01:47:58.860 --> 01:48:00.700
um

01:48:00.700 --> 01:48:02.700
Thank you very much

01:48:02.860 --> 01:48:09.100
Voltaums and thank you for ronald. I appreciate the gifts and memberships. I could

01:48:10.140 --> 01:48:11.820
um

01:48:11.820 --> 01:48:16.780
Cats and feets. Yes. I picked up. Thank you. Caleb Harris as well

01:48:18.140 --> 01:48:19.500
um, I

01:48:19.500 --> 01:48:26.540
adopted Vigil and Gimli and their starting situation is actually really sad, but it's a really happy ending so I

01:48:27.500 --> 01:48:29.980
I messaged a shelter and I was like, hey

01:48:30.780 --> 01:48:31.980
um

01:48:31.980 --> 01:48:33.020
I work from home

01:48:33.020 --> 01:48:38.060
I would love to open up my home to two cats that cannot be separated if you didn't know

01:48:38.460 --> 01:48:41.980
For adoption agencies and all that kind of thing. It's really hard to re-home

01:48:42.620 --> 01:48:44.300
doubles

01:48:44.300 --> 01:48:46.300
That are inseparable

01:48:46.780 --> 01:48:50.860
Um, so I messaged them and they came back and they were like we have these two

01:48:51.500 --> 01:48:52.620
Ruffians

01:48:52.620 --> 01:48:57.820
And they have come from an hoarder's home. Um, which makes them un

01:48:58.620 --> 01:49:02.540
They cannot be with any other animal but each other. Um

01:49:03.500 --> 01:49:12.540
So I went and visited them and they were these poor scaredy cats. They genuinely were so terrified of any humans. Um

01:49:13.500 --> 01:49:15.500
Thank you, yummy for the memba

01:49:15.900 --> 01:49:20.380
Thank you everyone who's like remembering as well for the correct tier. I do apologize about messing up that tier

01:49:20.860 --> 01:49:24.300
Um, yes, they're a bonded pair and they can't be separated

01:49:24.940 --> 01:49:30.700
But I just want to say the universe works in mysterious ways. Sorry. I know I'm supposed to be doing ASMR

01:49:30.780 --> 01:49:33.260
I'm just trying to call them right now without the microphone for

01:49:34.140 --> 01:49:36.620
The world will work in mysterious ways now

01:49:36.700 --> 01:49:41.580
I do not believe in supporting certain cat breeds which are bad for their health

01:49:41.980 --> 01:49:44.940
An example of that is the munchkin breed

01:49:45.660 --> 01:49:49.660
Vigo is mixed tabby and munchkin breed

01:49:50.700 --> 01:49:55.100
The universe will find ways to laugh in your face

01:49:56.060 --> 01:50:05.020
Because I am a big believer in like completely no longer breeding them and not letting them be a genetic line any further because it's so bad for their health

01:50:06.700 --> 01:50:13.900
San Baroli, thank you very much. And then the universe laughed in my face and said guess what?

01:50:14.380 --> 01:50:18.140
Your baby boy is a hafu and I'm like, okay

01:50:19.340 --> 01:50:21.340
Motons, thank you for the upgrade

01:50:21.500 --> 01:50:26.780
So yeah, if you ever think the universe doesn't have a little joke for you

01:50:26.940 --> 01:50:30.540
Oh, I assure you the universe is gonna it's got a joke for you

01:50:31.340 --> 01:50:34.620
Yeah, like pugs. Yeah, I am a bit of a

01:50:35.260 --> 01:50:42.060
Please don't support but this was just me. Um, like scotch fold cats. Um, that was adorable as they look

01:50:43.020 --> 01:50:49.020
Absolutely not. Hairless cats. Absolutely not. A lot of people will say like but I can look after them

01:50:49.260 --> 01:50:53.740
It's not about you looking after them. It's about the general population looking after them

01:50:53.980 --> 01:51:00.140
Does the general population gonna do all these steps about looking after their cat and the hairless ones

01:51:00.140 --> 01:51:05.820
Gaining at a bath and removing the dirt cells because it's not got freaking fur. No, it's not. Thank you the bigger picture

01:51:07.260 --> 01:51:10.380
Anyway, um, don't get me started on um

01:51:11.420 --> 01:51:14.620
Animal breeding because a lot of it is just absolutely insane

01:51:15.340 --> 01:51:21.340
I'm waiting till you get started and learn about what pedigree dogs are. Pedigree dogs are just certified. Um

01:51:22.620 --> 01:51:28.220
You literally get a certificate saying yes, this dog has been produced via freaking insane amounts of um

01:51:28.700 --> 01:51:34.700
Cest and it was like why is pedigree even a thing? Get a mutt. Muts are the healthiest kind of dog you can even get

01:51:35.100 --> 01:51:42.620
Like ah a mixed breed cats. They're the healthiest kind you can get like don't support the little munchkins that have freaking stilts for legs

01:51:42.700 --> 01:51:47.020
It's actually so freaking sad and I can't eat. Oh, oh, I could really start

01:51:51.180 --> 01:51:53.900
Anyway, uh, yeah, the universe will always have a joke for you

01:51:57.180 --> 01:52:00.460
So, yeah, uh, I despise munchkins

01:52:01.180 --> 01:52:04.060
I don't for the for the kindness of the poor cat

01:52:04.300 --> 01:52:10.140
They shouldn't be a thing and then the universe said oh, by the way, Vigo is a half mix of tabby and munchkin

01:52:10.300 --> 01:52:16.300
And yeah, he has saucer eyeballs. I should actually post a picture of my babies. Um

01:52:18.300 --> 01:52:21.980
But yeah, Vigo has saucer eyeballs. He's so adorable

01:52:22.700 --> 01:52:24.700
and the universe won

01:52:26.540 --> 01:52:31.580
Hey, do you do rabble and durian streams where you just go down a bunch of rabbit holes? Oh, absolutely

01:52:31.980 --> 01:52:39.500
Um, I did it in my sky room one. I started talking about the navy streamer overload ending where she becomes a god

01:52:40.140 --> 01:52:43.580
And starts a new religion type thing or like starts a new society

01:52:44.060 --> 01:52:46.940
Um, and like I started talking about conspiracy theories and stuff

01:52:47.100 --> 01:52:51.020
But I don't like going too deep into it because I know it like really just like people didn't like it

01:52:51.020 --> 01:52:53.660
So I was like, okay, I will maybe it too much. So it's me

01:52:54.380 --> 01:52:57.900
Hey, my mom used to read lavenders but regarding cats makes heads. Yeah

01:52:59.980 --> 01:53:08.140
Vivo is just a small rock every scrawny rage makes me a lover even more all Vigo. Yeah Vigo my cats in Vigo after

01:53:09.100 --> 01:53:16.540
The the guy did did you know in door to the rings and the scene where he kicks the helmet he was screaming for real

01:53:19.100 --> 01:53:21.980
Do you want to know why he screamed out for real like that?

01:53:22.380 --> 01:53:26.380
Because because he actually booked his to and yeah, and yes

01:53:26.620 --> 01:53:31.660
Did you name your cats after the lord of the rings? Of course I named my cats after the lord of the rings

01:53:31.660 --> 01:53:37.260
What else would I name them freaking bill and ben the flower pot man? No, I wouldn't

01:53:39.340 --> 01:53:43.340
So yeah, my baby boy my baby girl and yes, I gave

01:53:44.220 --> 01:53:46.220
Gimli

01:53:46.220 --> 01:53:48.220
Well, yeah, I gave Gimli a boy's name technically

01:53:48.780 --> 01:53:51.580
But Gimli's got ginger on her butt. So

01:53:52.460 --> 01:53:54.460
Gimli ma homina

01:53:55.020 --> 01:53:58.540
Yeah, name them bill and ben the flower pot man, honestly

01:53:59.420 --> 01:54:01.420
Oh

01:54:01.660 --> 01:54:03.660
Holy crap, you just made me remember bill and ben

01:54:05.900 --> 01:54:07.900
JJ you've got a picture of me

01:54:08.700 --> 01:54:11.900
Thank you for the membership JJ. I appreciate it

01:54:12.940 --> 01:54:20.860
Just for all members who are watching the membership stream start next week, but I promise you I will throw you into the thick of it

01:54:21.500 --> 01:54:24.460
Um, and we'll have a lot of fun from there

01:54:25.100 --> 01:54:27.100
We'll take it from there

01:54:27.100 --> 01:54:33.260
Because this week is kind of locked in a little bit. We do have a collab again with me and all my girly

01:54:34.620 --> 01:54:37.180
You are an adorable goober. We love it

01:54:40.060 --> 01:54:41.740
Uh, yes

01:54:41.740 --> 01:54:43.740
What's next Roseanne Jim?

01:54:44.060 --> 01:54:46.780
Yeah, I'm not gonna get any more uh putters

01:54:47.900 --> 01:54:49.900
after Viggo and

01:54:50.540 --> 01:54:54.940
Gimli I think um, I will probably have the biggest uh

01:54:55.740 --> 01:54:57.740
mental breakdown of my life

01:54:58.220 --> 01:55:04.300
Once they pass thankfully I have them very young they I think they're three years old

01:55:05.660 --> 01:55:10.940
Unfortunately due to the hoarder situation, they actually don't know what age my baby boy and baby girl are

01:55:11.980 --> 01:55:17.980
Like I was trying to get as much information that they had but they were just very honest and said like look we don't

01:55:18.380 --> 01:55:21.740
We don't actually have information on these babies

01:55:25.100 --> 01:55:30.140
Stroney, do you know if you get a cut of youtube premium membership watches? I absolutely do

01:55:31.100 --> 01:55:38.140
Um, if you pay for youtube or it used to be called youtube red, but if you do youtube premium

01:55:39.020 --> 01:55:40.380
um

01:55:40.380 --> 01:55:46.620
For however long you watch it like I get a percentage. So say you 100 watched me

01:55:47.100 --> 01:55:50.060
I get 100 of what you generate for

01:55:50.620 --> 01:55:54.780
Content creators does that make sense? It's the only percentage base to the best they can

01:55:56.700 --> 01:56:00.940
I've noticed my favorite troopers dabble in theories must be one of those jokes from the universe

01:56:01.100 --> 01:56:05.900
Honestly, the universe will have a little funny joke for you. Like please if you're ever like

01:56:06.620 --> 01:56:10.220
Thinking oh, there's nothing interesting's gonna happen in my life

01:56:10.300 --> 01:56:13.660
I assure you the universe is cooking something because I

01:56:14.300 --> 01:56:18.940
I am the biggest like don't support like pugs don't support

01:56:19.500 --> 01:56:24.380
French bulldogs like don't support munchkin cats don't do this or that

01:56:25.020 --> 01:56:30.540
And then the universe goes oh, by the way, here's a half munchkin. I'm like, oh, okay. I see how it is. I see how it is

01:56:32.940 --> 01:56:37.100
This is shooting is kind of hypnotic. Yeah, you can like see the balls move around in it

01:56:37.980 --> 01:56:39.980
It's just quite nice. I quite like it

01:56:40.940 --> 01:56:42.940
Wow

01:56:45.340 --> 01:56:49.660
It's like really therapeutic to like squish down into it honestly

01:56:50.940 --> 01:56:56.540
I'm not being like I'm I genuinely wholeheartedly mean it like it feels very nice to like squish something under my feet

01:56:58.780 --> 01:57:02.220
Go to go have fun with the rest of the stream. Congrats on monetization. Thank you

01:57:02.620 --> 01:57:06.300
Yes, please don't worry if you need go and I am going to redirect into the sheebie

01:57:07.260 --> 01:57:13.580
Actually, is she be up right now? Hold on. I'm I'm leaning over

01:57:16.460 --> 01:57:20.700
She's live right now with another crabs treasure. Oh, yeah

01:57:21.340 --> 01:57:26.460
Apparently the music in that game is like so good, but it's a dark souls crab

01:57:26.460 --> 01:57:28.300
I thought it was like a fun little crab game

01:57:28.540 --> 01:57:31.740
I was gonna play until someone said it was like it's like dark souls and I'm like, bro

01:57:31.740 --> 01:57:36.220
If I can't if I can't tag in the refluence to help me that's a game. There's a point

01:57:39.340 --> 01:57:48.220
Um, I will most likely do a talking stream membership one for next week just because there's so many

01:57:49.980 --> 01:57:53.020
Marshmallows, I can't really say but we can say

01:57:56.380 --> 01:57:59.100
Yeah, I hope you enjoyed this fake ASMR roleplay

01:57:59.900 --> 01:58:06.140
Roleplay aside from roleplay literally wasn't even ASMR. I'm talking to you at normal levels that I normally do for streams. So

01:58:07.020 --> 01:58:09.020
There's all

01:58:12.060 --> 01:58:18.060
It's us souls crab game, honestly adjusted the years boy. Thanks for the stream sonny. It's what sonny

01:58:19.580 --> 01:58:25.660
Thank you. No, alessandro for the two. I appreciate it. I really hope I've managed to say everyone's names

01:58:25.660 --> 01:58:30.380
Thank you so much for your patience as well as I completely messed that stream up and wholeheartedly

01:58:31.820 --> 01:58:35.580
Just like yapping in tone. That's all we're doing here

01:58:38.380 --> 01:58:42.540
Best stream I had feet and a kitty. What more could I ask for? Yeah, that was gimme

01:58:43.500 --> 01:58:47.500
Love this. Thank you so much. Thank you so much. Yes, I will go now

01:58:47.500 --> 01:58:52.300
but thank you so much to everyone who members shipped and

01:58:52.860 --> 01:59:00.780
Gifted and don't know and etc. The membership streams start next week because this week's schedule had already kind of been logged in

01:59:00.860 --> 01:59:03.500
And I didn't actually know when I was going to do the monetization

01:59:04.380 --> 01:59:05.980
Thank you. Doofus

01:59:05.980 --> 01:59:07.340

01:59:07.340 --> 01:59:13.340

01:59:13.500 --> 01:59:19.500
I always have free streams coming. I always have free content coming out. You just need to give me a little patience

01:59:19.740 --> 01:59:24.060
Um, but the dust is definitely starting to settle from debut

01:59:25.100 --> 01:59:27.820
Which means I can like fully focus on like everything I want to do

01:59:28.540 --> 01:59:33.580
Lex, thank you for the five gifts. I appreciate it. Congrats on those who caught it with your face

01:59:34.380 --> 01:59:37.740
Um, no the music. Thank you very much. I was very kind of you. Um,

01:59:38.460 --> 01:59:40.700
But yes, the dust is starting to settle

01:59:41.340 --> 01:59:42.940
Which is good

01:59:42.940 --> 01:59:47.580
Because I mean I can start focusing on the free content I want to do and all the stuff I want to

01:59:48.300 --> 01:59:51.340

01:59:58.140 --> 02:00:00.140
Yeah, my pro toe isn't doing so good

02:00:00.620 --> 02:00:02.620

Right this this is my kisses

02:00:17.580 --> 02:00:19.580
Hmm

02:00:23.660 --> 02:00:29.740
Bye-bye replays. Bye-bye. Look, I'm waving you goodbye. Bye-bye. Oh, this is like really hard

02:00:29.820 --> 02:00:31.820

02:00:33.100 --> 02:00:35.980
