0	10640	Hi there, yeah, the STDConnix just down there. This is that you're cleaning. Oh, you're
10640	17880	here to clean your ears. I apologize, guess. Hello, please come, sit down, sit down. Um,
17880	24360	I will just ask you a few questions and then we'll get started right away. I believe you
24360	36440	are my half-eleven appointment. Good. And yeah, I've just got a general ear cleaning
36440	48400	here. Do you have repeated experience with this? Mm, okay. Alright, I will get my gloves
48400	58240	on, do an inspection, and we will take it from there, okay? Mm, no, no, it's a quiet day today.
58240	71280	So, I will have fun looking after you. I just want to assure you, nothing to be worried about,
71280	79080	not gonna do anything without your say so, and obviously, because ears are very sensitive,
79080	88840	and if you need me to stop at any time, I absolutely will, okay? Um, so I'll just take a quick,
88840	108400	yes, they are very condensed, they are very blocked, which, I think you're actually gonna
108400	117720	present me with a challenge for once. I don't normally have, well, the normal procedure is just
117760	126600	hot water into the ear canal, but I have a sneaking suspicion that you are really gonna be testing
126600	135720	me. I'm just gonna spray this solution, okay? Just saline solution, it's salty, and in theory,
135720	145560	it should help break down the fats that are trapped in your ear. How does that feel?
145560	168320	Just gonna get a wipe, that's pain to me. Okay, let's try the bottle. Is that sore? No, not sore,
169080	184480	okay, I'm just gonna see if this brush is gonna make a difference. Well, I think I should
184480	199320	congratulate you for having the most stubborn earwax I think I've ever seen before. Anything?
199320	212200	Well, I don't think the brush is gonna cut it, so what I'm gonna do is get my tweezers. I'm gonna
212240	217840	try and do this very gently, because I know you said that it doesn't hurt, which is good,
217840	237720	which is very good. I do not want it to start hurting, so just... I think I just fixed the
237720	251240	problem. Now, when I ask you this, I request for you to be as honest as possible. Did you use ear
251240	258920	cleaners in your ear, and then the cotton became dislodged in your ear? Because I just pulled out
258920	264480	a massive wad of cotton. You know how on the boxes there's a big warning that says, do not put in
264480	271960	your ears. Yeah, this is the exact scenario why, so I assume that's exactly what's wrong on this side as well.
271960	290920	Tell you what, I'm gonna try and fix this ear first, because that definitely did not get all...
291920	295920	No, back to your other ear.
307920	319920	I'm definitely clear to you. I can't see any deeper, you know, conqueror that should affect your hearing.
319920	331920	Which I would like to hear. I'm just going to give you a few more sprays of that solution, because as much
331920	341920	as ears are self-cleaning, some ears are not as good at self-cleaning as they should be, so a little bit
341920	346920	cold. Okay.
351920	362920	Rub it in. Okay, a little bit of wax filled up, but just, you know, next time you're in the shower,
362920	372920	you're in the bath, just take a bottle of soap and rub it on your hands, and then do it on the top of the ear,
372920	384920	all on the outside of the ear, not the canal, the outside of the ear. Do not put anything inside the canal,
384920	400920	and that goes for Q-tips, or ear cleaners, or whatever have you. I've just got this little pump device to dry the earwax,
400920	418920	because I will be able to pick out the earwax now that it's dried up. It's just your basic extraction, so nothing to worry about.
418920	424920	I promise you, and I've lost my tool. Of course, I lost my tools, right behind me.
424920	443920	Right, this is just a soft, feel that soft wooden, okay. I'm just going to use it to carve out the wax that's piled up.
444920	469920	Unfortunately, for future treatments, the best I can recommend is a hot shower, or hot bath, to let your ears steam,
469920	477920	and then get in a basic tissue, and don't place it deep into the ear canal, just against the ear canal,
477920	488920	and no more to pick up any wax that may be sitting on your ears, okay? That's good.
488920	498920	I believe you. I will know to your other ear to remember if I hadn't lost my tool again.
505920	511920	Same thing as before, I'm just going to go in nice and gently.
518920	539920	There we go. That was so bad. It's a delicate job, it really is. I'm just going to move my chair closer to you.
540920	549920	Alright, that's a lot easier for me to be all up in your wrist, isn't it?
551920	561920	Just a very quick check that I've got everything. What's my trusty tweezers?
562920	576920	Yeah, that's good. I'll do the same thing again, where I'll spray some cold spritz.
577920	595920	There we go. Just massage it in a little. Do you still have that pain or discomfort, or is it gone now?
596920	602920	Okay, that's very good news. I'll just dry you off again.
603920	618920	It's so cold. Don't think it would be very appropriate if I were to do well all over again,
618920	633920	so I'll apologize for the cold. To maybe right back to picking out the wax. Just hold still for me.
633920	639920	Let us rest my hand on your face a little, just steady on the both of us.
641920	643920	Oh, that's good.
649920	654920	There we go.
654920	683920	Just going to wait for the excess on the back of my glove, don't worry.
683920	697920	This is why we glove up, but you already know that it protects the patient as much as it protects the practitioner.
698920	701920	Does that feel a little better?
705920	726920	I'll just warn you that if this incident were to occur again, please do just come straight into the clinic because blockages can actually lead to incredibly nasty infections.
726920	731920	And that's the last thing anyone wants to deal with right now.
735920	747920	Okay, so that's what I can do there. Just checking. This is just a soft brush.
756920	773920	I'll take another look just to make sure that I've done my eye tone, because I don't want to send you away to everyone.
774920	784920	If you do end up having pain, obviously you just come straight back to the clinic. Just hold your head up, look straight ahead.
785920	795920	Yeah, that is a little bit more deal for me to clean them up a bit better.
798920	806920	Honestly, as long as the blockage is removed, that is more certainly the main thing. I think we can both agree.
807920	817920	Just taking a look at my toenails to see if I have anything else that may be a pain with them.
823920	829920	Now this brush does go deeper into the canal. Do not be startled. It won't hurt.
829920	837920	But again, if you have any discomfort, please just tell me. Look straight ahead again for me.
837920	866920	There's that. Yeah, that may even be ticklish. But don't worry, because we dried the wax, it is very easy to also get any dust out.
867920	880920	Let's just check on the outside of the foil a little bit.
887920	888920	A little bit more.
898920	901920	That's okay.
908920	913920	I wish I had steadier hands for this job, but me too.
916920	922920	As long as I don't poke anyone's ear drum out, I probably shouldn't say that.
922920	925920	I wouldn't say that, although I have a tool inside your ear.
929920	932920	A little bit on the outside.
952920	953920	Okay.
958920	967920	I'm quite happy with that. If you're happy with it, I am happy with it. I can do a very basic hearing test on you.
968920	975920	It is not with equipment, that is my only note. It's what we actually do when we have younger patients with us.
976920	986920	It is your very basic left or right ear. You can just raise your hand or look in the direction that you hear the noise.
986920	992920	Very simplistic in nature. Just to make sure that your hearing is back to one on one.
1005920	1011920	The deeper noises, no one really struggles with them, it's the later.
1019920	1028920	Yeah, the older you get, the frequencies that you can hear get less and less.
1028920	1045920	Well, the higher pitch they are, which is why we have quite an array of things to test and obviously when it's a child, you have to try and entertain them as much as possible.
1045920	1057920	Or when the restless is incredibly hard to treat, a restless patient, but it's understandable. You're tired, you don't feel good.
1060920	1064920	This one actually, if you don't mind me reaching behind you, I do apologize.
1064920	1073920	It's very unprofessional. This one is probably one of the most rated for nasis.
1073920	1102920	Yes, I'm not sure how many. Honestly, so if a patient is presenting with limited,
1103920	1118920	capacity for hearing, we can ignore my dull right away, such as having to use louder voice, but it's quite nice to speak the lower tone.
1120920	1128920	As you can imagine with the older patients as well, you very much have to enunciate every word.
1129920	1150920	But yeah, your left and right ear is perfectly fine. If I look inside the ear, I can't see anything unless it's very, very deep inside your ear and you have a hidden crevice, you have a hidden area that I can't see.
1150920	1161920	This is the last test. I'm not worried about you at all.
1181920	1190920	I believe that's all I can do for you, although I tell a lie, I can send you away with the same liquid formula.
1191920	1201920	If you feel your ears are starting to be congested again or blocked off or feel you can't hear, try this solution.
1202920	1216920	I want you to use it in your ear and then lie down so the liquid stays in the canal for as long as possible and then get tissue to remove anything that leaks out once you sit up right again.
1221920	1223920	Is there anything else I can do for you?
1224920	1240920	Nope. Alright, then you take this home with you and I can give you some approved medical ear cleaning tools. Do not shove them in your canals or I will come after you.
1241920	1257920	If you take these with you, thank you very much and as cruel as this sounds, hopefully our paths don't meet again because it means your ear health is fantastic.
1259920	1262920	Thank you so much. Bye now.
