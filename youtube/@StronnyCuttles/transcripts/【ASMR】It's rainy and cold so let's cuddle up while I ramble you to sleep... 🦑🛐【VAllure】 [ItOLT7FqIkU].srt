1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:20,000
my little reflex I added a denoiser filter but I don't know if that made the stream worse

2
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
hi reflex

3
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
good morning

4
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:43,000
mommy's right here she just had to wake up late because I was being a mommy and I was having to do a lot of work

5
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,000
I'm strongly left by some I mean it

6
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:55,000
hello hello my little reflex

7
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:01,000
hi shh shh shh shh shh shh it's okay

8
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
mommy's here

9
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:09,000
shh shh shh hello little baby

10
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:27,000
I've put a little um a noise gate on the microphone so hopefully the background noise isn't like the weight noise isn't too bad

11
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:35,000
I um they don't cope well without you know I don't cope well without my reflinks

12
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:50,000
I had to do some business last night and there may or may not be a collab with another agency planned

13
00:01:50,000 --> 00:02:02,000
um do I spoil it do you want me to spoil the surprise cause only you only know what the surprise is if you're in this chat right now

14
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:08,000
also please do check emotes for those of you who are on the emotes here

15
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:18,000
I was able to add all 10 of my emotes and I get to order 10 more and I'm so excited to order the next batch of 10 emotes

16
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:38,000
um I already have a few ideas but yes please I will try to be as relaxed as I can but the problem is I get so excited talking to you

17
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:45,000
that basically the ASMR goes out the window hold on what is this there we go

18
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:53,000
yeah there's your warning uh we are not doing hypnosis uh unfortunately

19
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:59,000
thank you very much night sterling for becoming a free fling member dear

23
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:27,000
thank you again Gwispy for becoming a member

24
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:35,000
I know I've got my hypnosis background I was originally going

25
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:43,000
huh Brian can you guys hear Brian

26
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:48,000
pachinka thank you for the five gifted hold on let me get a stream of elements

27
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:53,000
anonymous thank you for the tip

28
00:03:53,000 --> 00:04:01,000
wait anonymous is high strongy hopefully your day is amazing it's just going to start it

29
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:06,000
and since I get to start with my reef links it's going great

30
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Brian is very quiet yes I didn't I knew ASMR so I turned Brian down like right away

31
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:23,000
I can maybe film up a little bit but I have a quick question how did you learn hypnosis

32
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:27,000
I just observe I want to get into but it's kind of intimidating

33
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:36,000
literally I just observe I absolutely love going like deep into things I don't know about

34
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:44,000
and I've always had an interest in it so I like to consume people's production or whatever

35
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:54,000
sorry and thank you for the 100 but congrats on monetization years for some of that most bro

36
00:04:54,000 --> 00:05:00,000
sorry and that's a lot thank you oh my god

37
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:06,000
100 dollar tip that's crazy 100 centimeters nah that's not possible

38
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:11,000
but pachinka thank you for the five gifted

39
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:22,000
but yeah I just really like challenging myself I always have a fascination in trying to understand

40
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:27,000
why people like certain things I know that seems silly

41
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:38,000
but I do I just enjoy it like as much as I might tease the prep bros or something like that

42
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:46,000
I just find it fascinating I honestly do like what makes you you know what make what tickles your pickle

43
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:54,000
it's like it's a challenge to me and I accept it wholeheartedly

44
00:05:54,000 --> 00:06:04,000
but yeah secret subject is an excellent feature but secret subject is such a sweet heart

45
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:14,000
she so willingly educates the masses about it and like I love that she doesn't like cakey bit or anything

46
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:24,000
but like everything that I do right now or produce is because of observations I've made

47
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:34,000
thank you she's learning from spells and empathizing it reminds me of someone

48
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:44,000
yeah secret is fantastic she's got a new feature for model which is like a polygon design

49
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:52,000
like all the video games and I was tempted to get one for myself when I'm playing Nintendo DS games

50
00:06:52,000 --> 00:07:00,000
because the graphics we're gonna be playing a game called Dragon Quest Senators of the Stars guys

51
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:09,000
and obviously the graphics are Nintendo graphics but I thought it would be cool if that model would match

52
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:19,000
but I'd rather save the money and get it for the girls like I have very bad news for Shibi and Insura investors

53
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:24,000
they will be getting a toggle that covers them up

54
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:30,000
me and Mercy did not upset

55
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,000
congrats to those who got the memberships with their face

56
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:42,000
me and Mercy's chests don't upset YouTube

57
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Asura and Shibi's chests has upset YouTube

58
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:55,000
it will not if you notice that A.C.'s trailer video has like 30,000 views

59
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,000
that's because advertisement money was put into it

60
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:03,000
everyone had the same amount of advertisement money except me

61
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,000
like I've never put the same amount on myself

62
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,000
actually don't think I've spent any on myself

63
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:21,000
but Asura and Shibi were denied at running predominantly due to their chest

64
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Asura's ASMR short was denied even though she's not doing a single thing wrong in it

65
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:37,000
so sadly at the moment the girls are being very creative and doing a little thing

66
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:48,000
yes, I will say to the girls they are welcome to use their toggles when they think the situation calls for it

67
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
that's perfectly fine by me

68
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:56,000
yes, even the shorts the girls weren't allowed

69
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:01,000
now that they're monetized

70
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:09,000
today, Mercy is doing her celebration I believe

71
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:17,000
so please do let her entertain you

72
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,000
I'm probably going to be lurking her monetization

73
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
her thing is live

74
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,000
A.C. is on Saturday

75
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Emmy, I don't know when Emmy wants to do it

76
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:33,000
I mean, you know what? I'm going to DM her right now

77
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:43,000
A.M.A. Mers just wanted to know

78
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:59,000
when you plan, when you plan on doing your CELA aberration stream

79
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:09,000
just so I know when to membership

80
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
live

81
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:16,000
and then I'll do a little, I'll do it before she's in the channel

82
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:20,000
and then I'll do a little head bath

83
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
A.M.A. Mers, I don't know what you're doing

84
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:27,000
she's so going to know how to type that by if there's no way

85
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:32,000
oh no, she's on mobile, she's on her phone, she can see

86
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:36,000
oh my god, the key clicking was in my head with my headphones

87
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:41,000
sorry, Emmy was watching, I say okay

88
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:51,000
yes, Azura and Shibi, it's not lost on me that Azura and Shibi are waiting for monetization

89
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:55,000
and they both just happened to have the biggest boobs

90
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
feature per manager ASMR

91
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:05,000
it's, I do like the boring stuff like the kind of monotonous stuff

92
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:11,000
where it's like, oh you need to open up membership to your type thing

93
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
and you need to do this and that

94
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
like I try not to let the girls do that

95
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:22,000
because it's both stressful and it's both like, it takes time

96
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:26,000
and rather the girls focus on like having fun at debut and all

97
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:30,000
and then they're, well they're second week now

98
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,000
not bad, it was an exciting, expensive, real

99
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
that's cause they're for ya

100
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:42,000
but they will get monetization nonetheless, right?

101
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:46,000
well, we're waiting on it

102
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:52,000
I think the AI detection is, is flagged to them basically

103
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:56,000
so a human does need to review them which takes longer

104
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:06,000
let's just pray that we have like a weeb that understands what an Earth featuring is

105
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:10,000
cause if they get denied, I'm gonna be so, I'm gonna be raging

106
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
I'm not even gonna lie

107
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
I don't think there's gonna be issues

108
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:19,000
I think the AI has just sent them on to

109
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
yeah

110
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:29,000
someone says you own your own tag at real34

111
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
now let's go

112
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,000
weeps in YouTube headquarters

113
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:38,000
yeah, be better

114
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:43,000
did you like my ASMR yesterday? oh my god, I was outrageous

115
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,000
I can't believe I even did that

116
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:54,000
got my tools out, I bet you liked that, didn't ya?

117
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
I was juicy

118
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:08,000
I was pretty gay, great, but can you feel your teeth?

119
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
what, cause I liked it so much

120
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
ah

121
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
hi, Anon

122
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
thank you for the tip, Anon

123
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:33,000
I don't know if you heard that cause Brian is so nice and quiet

124
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:39,000
are marshmallow messages anonymous? yes, that is why they are favoured by many

125
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:44,000
one of my gen mates had a Q&A and you wanted to ask a question

126
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Anon, but you were scared to send one

127
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:53,000
do they see you send some or you know we do not see a single thing

128
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:57,000
information wise, it's just a question

129
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:05,000
you can send them if you want, but yeah

130
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:10,000
do they not see you send them or do they see if you sent the message in the past?

131
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
no

132
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:15,000
I can vouch right now and say no, I cannot tell

133
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:20,000
someone could send me three questions in a row and change their spelling

134
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,000
and I wouldn't know so I'm looking confident

135
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Brian in the far distance

136
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:32,000
I left work early to watch you, but guys

137
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,000
I hope you're okay and you feel better soon

138
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
I like the measuring section

139
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:42,000
now everyone knows I have long toes, what you can do about it

140
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:47,000
but yes please, so can you tell based on spelling

141
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:51,000
well you don't have to worry about me when it comes to spelling

142
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:58,000
there's absolutely no way I can clock you other than if you send a pip you

143
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:02,000
I recognise that girl

144
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
sitting on your feet again

145
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:08,000
I'm gollum sitting right now so my feet are in front of me

146
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
and pushed into the chair

147
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:15,000
she's learning the pattern, no I cannot do that

148
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:21,000
I'll let the girl talk about it but there's one girl

149
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:26,000
a vealer that does recognise text

150
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:31,000
monga is, I don't know how her brain does it but

151
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
yeah

152
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:37,000
we were close to having a cats and ace in the forest dream

153
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
you've got to see Kim Lee

154
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:44,000
and then I go that's where we learned Kim Lee

155
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
how's your daughter?

156
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
yeah I'm gonna get a doctor's appointment

157
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,000
something's not right

158
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
someone was like you need to sue

159
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
and I was like nah it's just why

160
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,000
it's kind of a risk you accept

161
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
because it's a job shop

162
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,000
you can get like sorry I need to scratch my head

163
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
my head says sin

164
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:08,000
or my headset and then

165
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,000
it's just the thing

166
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:14,000
watching you during my collab lecture

167
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
I'm in your ears

168
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:20,000
look left look right I might be in the lecture audience right now

169
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
I know that's not how it works

170
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
but get educated get educated

171
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
I need to go to the doctor

172
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
yeah don't worry I am

173
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
someone sent me a marshmallow

174
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
and I was like okay you've convinced me

175
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,000
so don't worry I've got a doctor's appointment coming up

176
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:40,000
someone says very nice celebration

177
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
sorry I'm reading marshmallows

178
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
I said sleepy

179
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
I'm so so sleepy refling

180
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
I was up solely

181
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
I've only had five hours sleep

182
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
I'm probably gonna go back to sleep

183
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
but yeah

184
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,000
I was planning all these fun things

185
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:04,000
and making a lot of progress

186
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:10,000
my ASMR series is about to start up

187
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,000
my thank you for eggs

188
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:16,000
subscriber series is about to start

189
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,000
and I have no idea what to edit first

190
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:23,000
my first thing was gonna be ear licking

191
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
but that's not allowed anymore

192
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:28,000
and I did a pop rock ear licking

193
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
and that's not gonna be allowed

194
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
so

195
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
I have no idea

196
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
I do have burping ASMR

197
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
I might make that

198
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
I have like thigh cupping

199
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
I have like sitting on the mic ASMR

200
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,000
like I sit on it over and over again

201
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:48,000
you're almost at 5k a pair or not be

202
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,000
you guys are showing too much support

203
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:54,000
thank you lord of storms for becoming a member

204
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:00,000
but yeah I do have like sitting on the mic ASMR

205
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,000
I was squatting so hard

206
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
I have like clapping

207
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
without using my hands ASMR

208
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
so that's gonna be interesting

209
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:14,000
but I'll probably edit all that stuff

210
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
you heard her hit 5k right now

211
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,000
stop being so amazing and perfect then

212
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,000
too much support literally

213
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
but like don't be

214
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:30,000
get subscribed, get subscribed, get subscribed

215
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
so many ASMRs yes

216
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
I have a long day

217
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
to think of

218
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
clapping without using your hands

219
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
oh yeah

220
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
but thank you for the day

221
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
no matter what you do for ASMR

222
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:48,000
we'll enjoy it even the burp ASMR

223
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,000
I took a bottle of water

224
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
a bottle of water

225
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
and a can of cola

226
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
and in the ASMR booth

227
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
I basically chocked it

228
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:02,000
to produce burps for burping ear to ear ASMR

229
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,000
I think it will be like 14 minutes long

230
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
I need to order the artwork

231
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
of me being pregnant with you

232
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
cause I want to make that ASMR

233
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
I want to make it really good

234
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
I want to put all my love into it

235
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:19,000
especially the burp ASMR

236
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,000
suffering from success

237
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
it's funny how you're giving the people

238
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
what they need and what they want

239
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,000
yeah

240
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
I made a joke and it was like

241
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,000
the average

242
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,000
uh

243
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
VTuber would put it behind all paywall

244
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,000
me

245
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000

247
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,000

249
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,000

253
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,000

I'm making an ASMR where I'm pregnant with you

257
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
and you're the father

258
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:58,000
and there's nothing you can do about it

259
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
you had my curie I'll say

260
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
but now you have my ditch

261
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000

267
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,000

270
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,000
google

271
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:24,000
translate

272
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
let's go

273
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
what's the translation

274
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,000

275
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,000
thank you vacuum for becoming a member

276
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000

277
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000

278
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,000

279
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
I'm gonna do like a

280
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:50,000
girlfriend forgets to mute her mic while she's eating

281
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:54,000
so obviously it's only for people who like eating sounds

282
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
because I inhale my food

283
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,000
so I'm gonna order like KFC

284
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,000
and then basically just head recording

285
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
bleep bleep bleep bleep bleep bleep bleep bleep bleep

286

so if you like live ASMR

315
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
that's extra cuddly

316
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000

317
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:24,000

329
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
I'm so sorry if I didn't

330
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
I got streamed elements open

331
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
so I can see anything I miss

332
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
but yeah thank you

333
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:09,000
he did admit it I can't decide

334
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:12,000
spicy hot slurping ASMR

335
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:19,000
so I follow in real life ASMRists

336
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:25,000
and they also got hit with a warning for ear licking

337
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:30,000
so yeah my theory that YouTube has done a stealth policy update

338
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:33,000
is getting stronger and stronger by the second

339
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:37,000
if in real life channels are now getting hit as well

340
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:42,000
so oh I just cracked my freaking wrist if you heard that

341
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
that was so loud

342
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000

355
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:39,000
reluctantly say it says the towers are so wonderfully amazing

356
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000
it's hard not to love them one

357
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,000
it's literally impossible

358
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:49,000
but yes I think I will buy you at Twitter premium

359
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:53,000
and I'll just upload those ear licking videos that I recorded

360
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:58,000
and I'll also put them on Patreon just like for storage

361
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:01,000
so you can listen at any time okay

362
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:04,000
because it seems a shame to like

363
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:07,000
waste those recorded sessions

364
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:12,000
for Twitter premium lets me upload like full videos

365
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:16,000
so I'll just put it on like I'm for free and all that

366
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,000
give it even on money

367
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:23,000
like I don't have a chance I'll go into the feature brush I'm on okay

368
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:26,000
YouTube craze crack it down and ruin it forever

369
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
you're ruining it

370
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:31,000
do you guys want me to put you in between my thighs

371
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:36,000
that's your in between my thighs right now

372
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
do you like it

373
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:43,000
you wanna be in between my thighs forever

374
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,000
sorry

375
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:48,000
sorry I'm picking the mic

376
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:51,000
okay just stay in between my thighs

377
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
that 3d you're literally

378
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
I got you in that head long

379
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
there's nothing you can do about it

380
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:04,000
we're a watermelon honestly

381
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,000
bansley

382
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:11,000
yes we can link bansley on YouTube

383
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,000
that's not allowed

384
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,000
please crush my skull

385
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:20,000
I feel like all the platforms are going over the top

386
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
filtering yes

387
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:25,000
I agree it's getting ridiculous

388
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
my enjoyers are being fed

389
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:31,000
could you imagine

390
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,000
don't be a star fat

391
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:40,000
don't be a troll box enthusiast

392
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
thank you for the tip

393
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:45,000
don't be so silly

394
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,000
you're just trying to upset me

395
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:50,000
mr. cardboard box aren't you

396
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:55,000
well the funny thing is

397
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:59,000
twitter just announced that they officially

398
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:03,000
acknowledge and accept that kind of content

399
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,000
and I was like wait a minute

400
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:08,000
but this is good for us this is based

401
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:14,000
but yes you can't stop the reflinks I can know

402
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,000
for a male in the neighborhood

403
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,000
now you're reflinks

404
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,000
you'll always be my reflinks

405
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:28,000
I had to wait an entire year to call you reflinks

406
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:31,000
okay I'm actually going to make

407
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,000
I think I may have said this

408
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
I can't remember if I ever know

409
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
I am going to make a reprogramming

410
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
hypnosis asmr

411
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:41,000
where I get you to forget your name

412
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:44,000
and make you respond to reflinks

413
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:47,000
and it's going to be a subconscious plant

414
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:50,000
so it will always be effective unless

415
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:53,000
sorry that was my hot war ball if you heard it

416
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:57,000
unless you listen to my audio

417
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:00,000
that reverses any permanent effects

418
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
it's going to be my permanent effect

419
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
the first audio is

420
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
you are reflinking

421
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
you will respond to reflinks

422
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:11,000
and you are mine and owned by me

423
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:15,000
but I am a merciful streamer

424
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:19,000
and you're more than welcome to

425
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,000
be part of other communities

426
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:24,000
such as snippets and harem and all that

427
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
to have a problem

428
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,000
the reprogramming

429
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:30,000
yes I do have a reprogramming audio

430
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:33,000
it will be available very shortly

431
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,000
the funny thing is

432
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
I'm going to upload it

433
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:40,000
before I even upload any permanent effect hypnosis

434
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
just to be super duper safe

435
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:46,000
and everyone knows where to grab it

436
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:49,000
don't need hypnosis for that

437
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,000
I already forgot my name

438
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,000
I don't need

439
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
get reprogrammed

440
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
get reprogrammed

441
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
yes

442
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:01,000
get reprogrammed

443
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:04,000
get to know we'll have it from the start

444
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,000
yeah

445
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:08,000
I already responded to reflinks

446
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
yeah

447
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:14,000
I find that so adorable

448
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:18,000
you're such a good refling aren't you

449
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:22,000
so well behaved for me

450
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:25,000
I love that you're a good boy for me

451
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:31,000
and I love that we can tease each other

452
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:35,000
and just have a really good time

453
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:38,000
yeah I might get my

454
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
oh no mommy I said mommy

455
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,000
I read mommy in the chat

456
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:44,000
this is why I can't read into ASMR at the same time

457
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:47,000
thank you sir gang

458
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:52,000
thank you for the consideration

459
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,000
oh yeah no

460
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:58,000
I'm educated enough to know

461
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
permanent effect hypnosis

462
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,000
I don't

463
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,000
I think it's very dangerous too

464
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:06,000
thank you for the 10

465
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,000
super chat

466
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:12,000
we accept our stinky overlord

467
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:15,000
it's not in my budget to support both on paper

468
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,000
true on membership

469
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,000
what do you recommend

470
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:22,000
please know I always have free content

471
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
always coming out as well on my alternative

472
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
whether I do have plans

473
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,000
please don't worry

474
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:31,000
there'll always be free streams and free audios of that variety

475
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:36,000
if you prefer a live stream experience

476
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:39,000
then a youtube membership

477
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:44,000
if you prefer a audio

478
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:47,000
edited audio experience

479
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,000
where's the ending

480
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:52,000
you are supposed to ink

481
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:55,000
definitely check out my patreon

482
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:59,000
the link is in the description

483
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:07,000
oh do you want sniffing ASMR

484
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:11,000
oh a replay

485
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:14,000
oh wait no sniffing is limited ads

486
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:18,000
oh I'm so sorry sniffing is limited ads

487
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
I completely forgot

488
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
I don't know why

489
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:26,000
but sniffing ASMR is also considered

490
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:30,000
like gratifying content

491
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:33,000
so I can't really do sniffing

492
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:38,000
yeah I don't know what is going on at youtube head wars

493
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:43,000
but something funky and sus is going on

494
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,000
I don't know

495
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,000
of all things

496
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,000
I know

497
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,000
I honestly

498
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,000
I don't understand

499
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:53,000
there's like a hidden policy update going on

500
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,000
they've not announced it

501
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:57,000
I think the reason they're not announced it

502
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:01,000
is because so many people enjoy ASMR

503
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,000
zen bros

504
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,000
I don't know why

505
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:10,000
like all of ac's streams are like limited ads

506
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:13,000
I don't know what she's getting up to in the streams

507
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:17,000
but it's definitely not looking good

508
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:21,000
now youtube have referred to the policies before

509
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:24,000
so I'm gonna hope that they do

510
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:27,000
ac's diya

511
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,000
oh my god I can't say that name

512
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:32,000
there's too many vowels in your name

513
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:35,000
ac's diya

514
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,000
thank you for the membership

515
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,000
that's not why you say that

516
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:42,000
ac's diya

517
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
I am so sorry

518
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:47,000
I'm absolutely picturing your name

519
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,000
at the street

520
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,000
youtube will be only ASMR

521
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,000
ac does not stay sus

522
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,000
oh ok well

523
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,000
I mean

524
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:00,000
I can't do a few things here and there

525
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:06,000
as long as no one says a thing

526
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:10,000
I'm a girl

527
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000
I know I'm not the main demographic

528
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,000
but I love Fielder

529
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,000
oh I'm so glad you're gonna enjoy it

530
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:19,000
we are

531
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:23,000
it's like I'm not gonna lie and say that

532
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,000
you know

533
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
guys pay my bills

534
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
so I'll appeal to guys

535
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
but I'm glad you're gonna enjoy Fielder

536
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,000
for what it's worth

537
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,000
my lips are sealed

538
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,000
if your lips are sealed

539
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,000
then maybe

540
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:40,000
just maybe we can get up to a few shenanigans

541
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
cause reflux when we shenan once

542
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:45,000
you know we're gonna shenan again

543
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:53,000
ac's youtube streams are very

544
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,000
ok

545
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,000
I'll take your word for it reflux

546
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:02,000
yeah snitches get stitches

547
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,000
don't think I won't send Emmy on you

548
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:07,000
do you think that book is just for

549
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,000
resurrection spells

550
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,000
that book

551
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,000
oh dear

552
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,000
that book is nothing but trouble

553
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:18,000
the things that Emmy can do to you

554
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,000
is staggering

555
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
I'll say Emmy on you

556
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,000
ok

557
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:26,000
lips are completely sealed

558
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
good

559
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
you're gonna shenan again

560
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
yeah

561
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:38,000
wait can you really hypnotise people

562
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
well in my other ASMR stream

563
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:43,000
I think I managed to get quite a few

564
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,000
I'm not doing hypnosis right now though

565
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,000
but I do have some hypnosis

566
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,000
audios coming out in the blood

567
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,000
I wonder if Andy and Lily was an inspiration

568
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,000
for Emmy's lore

569
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,000
no

570
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:59,000
I had not actually played or consumed

571
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:02,000
the game when Emmy was conceptualised

572
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:05,000
she was conceptualised in June last year

573
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:08,000
the reason why Emmy is Emmy

574
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:11,000
is because I'm a massive fucking

575
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,000
broken

576
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,000
yeah

577
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
all the girls may or may not have been

578
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,000
male influenced by what I like

579
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:23,000
I kind of said this

580
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,000
but Emmy is everything

581
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,000
if I had a later voice

582
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,000
I am not even kidding

583
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,000
if I had a later voice

584
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,000
Emmy is exactly who I would want to be

585
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,000
as a content creator

586
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,000
the lore

587
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,000
the

588
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,000
oneechan

589
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,000
but I don't have a late voice

590
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
so I can't be Emmy

591
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:47,000
Ms. Morgan thank you for becoming a member

592
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:51,000
your hypnosis eyes animation is so unique

593
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,000
it's so good

594
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,000
like

595
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,000
wow

596
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:56,000
oh

597
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,000
I think I need to get a lore closer

598
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
don't worry I'm not hypnotising you this year

599
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,000
what

600
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,000
sorry

601
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,000
but yeah

602
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,000
if you really want to like

603
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:12,000
I'm not hypnotising you don't worry

604
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
but yeah that's mine

605
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,000
and I can also stack them

606
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
if you wanted a bigger focal point

607
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000
to focus on

608
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,000
so it's kind of like a hidden spiral

609
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,000
or

610
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,000
like this

611
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,000
this is like very big basic

612
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,000
but yeah

613
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,000
I will utilize these

614
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
wow I'm like really close

615
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,000
is this too close

616
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,000
I need to be further away

617
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,000
are you like seeing my teeth

618
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,000
I

619
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,000
your eyes are so pretty thank you

620
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
I love that all of us at VLR

621
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
have unique pupils

622
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,000
my

623
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,000
it's a very nice distance

624
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,000
okay

625
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,000
I'll stay here then

626
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,000
my bangs are slightly transparent

627
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,000

628
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,000

630
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,000
yeah

631
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,000
get

632
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,000
because of my ear

633
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,000
wow

634
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,000
I promise I won't do any hypnotising

635
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
permanent amazings

636
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,000

thank you for the tip

639
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,000
I think everyone should start manually breathing

640
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,000
what have you done

641
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,000

642
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,000
unleashed upon these lands

our time together

726
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:04,000

00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:22,000
that's amazing

735
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,000
I'm glad you can link AC

736
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,000
you are definitely uchi-san levels

737
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,000
but if you're really good

738
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:31,000
AC may even call you daddy in her accent

739
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:33,000
thank you

740
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:37,000
thank you for becoming a member

741
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:40,000
and thank you funky for becoming a member

742
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,000
thank you very much

743
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,000
just as a reminder for members

744
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:50,000
membership stream start next week

745
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:55,000
because the schedule for this week was pretty locked in

746
00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:00,000
and I just had a few background things I need to finish

747
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:03,000
but I'm like 100% sure

748
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,000
by week 3

749
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:07,000
I am officially

750
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:09,000
I have no responsibilities

751
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:12,000
I'm feeler and I am so freaking happy

752
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:17,000
I'm gonna be lurking because I'm a workiest

753
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:20,000
don't worry your audio sets so hard

754
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:25,000
have you ever thought about hypnotizing another girl and feeler

755
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:29,000
she's welcome to listen to any of my audios at will

756
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:33,000
I will not stop any of the girls

757
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:37,000
but I would want to condition them to be a bit different

758
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:43,000
maybe not condition them to respond to replay

759
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,000
but instead

760
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:52,000
to let me make a certain audio with them

761
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:58,000
of my C theme of a rye egg

762
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,000
could you imagine

763
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:04,000
C theme hypnosis on one of my daughters

764
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:07,000
oh

765
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:13,000
mommy tomorrow all the vehicular girls are together

766
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:16,000
I'm so excited for a collab together

767
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,000
special shout out

768
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:23,000
to mersey for streaming so early

769
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:25,000
as syrup for being early

770
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:27,000
and me for being early

771
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:29,000
shebi for being early

772
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:31,000
and ac for being later

773
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:33,000
to pick a time zone

774
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:36,000
and I was like if you guys do me this favor

775
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,000
and do it at my regular stream time

776
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,000
I will repay you

777
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,000
in more shorts

778
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:47,000
if strongy

779
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:49,000
streamed responsibly

780
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:51,000
12 hours a day

781
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:54,000
are you supposed to keep up after the third week

782
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,000
oh that's the fun part

783
00:43:56,000 --> 00:44:00,000
the third week has 4 days of Elden Ring insurance streams

784
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:03,000
because we need to play the DLC together

785
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:10,000
yeah we have back to back to back to back insurance streams

786
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,000
on the third week

787
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,000
because of Elden Ring

788
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:23,000
curious are you going to do any non-gendered content

789
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:25,000
I am so sorry

790
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:27,000
I do he-him content

791
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:29,000
and I apologize greatly

792
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,000
I

793
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:33,000
it

794
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:38,000
I don't want to say it simply gets harder to make the alternative content in us

795
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,000
I make he-him

796
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,000
I'm very sorry if that filler issue

797
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,000
I completely understand

798
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:47,000
if you no longer wish to watch because of that fact

799
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:51,000
I don't know what the other girls are planning

800
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:54,000
but I do know the name

801
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:58,000
of some asmr artists that make female content

802
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:01,000
one of them is a fan car asmr

803
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:03,000
I believe

804
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:05,000
she makes

805
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:07,000
female for female content

806
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:08,000
is

807
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,000
what's in your last stream

808
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:11,000
congrats on monetization

809
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:12,000
thank you

810
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,000
I'll start a new character with me

811
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:15,000
yeah

812
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:17,000
thank you not sleep for a week

813
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:22,000
basically week 3 is Elden Ring together

814
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,000
and I'm going to have my heart rate monitor

815
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,000
in a short color on

816
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:28,000
every time

817
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:32,000
I cause us reeflings to lose the fight

818
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:36,000
you guys get to shock me basically

819
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,000
and then on week 4

820
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:41,000
we're doing runescape endurance to get 99

821
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:44,000
because I want to get 99 cooking

822
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:45,000
and I will get it

823
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:47,000
so I believe

824
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:49,000
on week 4

825
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:51,000
I will also tell you what movies we're doing

826
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:53,000
watch your logs off

827
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,000
so you guys can download it

828
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:58,000
and I'll do the thing where I timestamp on screen

829
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:01,000
and all that

830
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:04,000
yeah I watched some already still enjoying your other content

831
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:05,000
thank you so much

832
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:06,000
I appreciate that

833
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:09,000
and thank you for your understanding surrounding it

834
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:12,000
mommy also sponsors

835
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,000
other asmr artists

836
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,000
I just want everyone

837
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:19,000
to be avaliably forgotten to do tingles

838
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:21,000
I'm just whispering at this point

839
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:24,000
I just want everyone to be able to enjoy the content

840
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,000
they consume

841
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,000
and if that means I can help you fight

842
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:30,000
the person that speaks to you

843
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:31,000
that oshi

844
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:33,000
or that person you really enjoy

845
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:34,000
cause like

846
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:37,000
wait until I get done this rabbit hole

847
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:38,000
okay

848
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:40,000
ps thank you for the reefling that encouraged me

849
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:42,000
and marshmallow to go down

850
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,000
all the rabbit holes I desire

851
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,000
I won't yape your ear off

852
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,000
unapologetically from now on

853
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:49,000
um

854
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:50,000
so

855
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,000
because of the way society

856
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:53,000
is set up

857
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:56,000
humans naturally need a face

858
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:57,000
after work

859
00:46:57,000 --> 00:47:00,000
or after doing stressful situations

860
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,000
a face can include alcohol

861
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,000
a face can include smoking

862
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:08,000
a face can include recreational drugs

863
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,000
a face can include

864
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:11,000
youtubers

865
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:12,000
feedubers

866
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:13,000
asmr

867
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:15,000
you should not be ashamed

868
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:16,000
of what you need

869
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,000
to help you get through the day

870
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:21,000
humans are not set up for the society

871
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:23,000
that we are currently living in right now

872
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:26,000
and I will scream that from the rooftops

873
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:29,000
to not ever be embarrassed at all

874
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:31,000
for what you need to do

875
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:32,000
to get through the day

876
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:34,000
a face is also music

877
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:37,000
you may listen to Mongolian throat singing

878
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:40,000
I will not judge you for listening to Mongolian throat singing

879
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,000
okay

880
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:43,000
so

881
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:47,000
that is why I am not a jealous feature bird

882
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:49,000
I want you to thrive

883
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:53,000
I want your health to be as best as it can be

884
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:55,000
if that means after work

885
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:58,000
instead of watching a vote of mine

886
00:47:58,000 --> 00:47:59,000
for example

887
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:01,000
you watch another creator

888
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:04,000
I am happy

889
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,000
you are able to de-stress yourself

890
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:09,000
you are able to regulate your nervous system

891
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:12,000
you are able to look after yourself

892
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:13,000
okay

893
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:16,000
think of yourself like a sims

894
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:19,000
you unironically have bars of needs

895
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:21,000
and what happens to a sim

896
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:23,000
when you ignore their needs

897
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:25,000
well they start to lose it

898
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:28,000
they start to have these unfortunate side effects

899
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:30,000
they start to struggle with life

900
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:31,000
they cannot function

901
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:33,000
they cannot follow orders

902
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:34,000
okay

903
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:36,000
so please

904
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:38,000
understand

905
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:40,000
if you think to yourself right now

906
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:41,000
strongy

907
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:43,000
I don't think you are the one for me

908
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:47,000
I implore you my dear watcher

909
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:49,000

935
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:55,000

941
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:08,000
they deserve a chance

942
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:10,000

00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:20,000
the girls have been struggling

947
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:22,000
trying to watch everyone

948
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:24,000

949
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:26,000
but those indulges so strong

950
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:28,000

please indulge in my daughters at will

952
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:35,000
I like virtual abuse

953
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:37,000
I can't deny it yes

954
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:40,000
a sura ad in your audio

955
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:47,000

956
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:50,000
thank you for the 100

957
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:53,000

00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:56,000
still no idea how you so much awesome

959
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:58,000

we adore your last will pass it to the doors

961
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:02,000
thank you

962
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:04,000
I really appreciate that

963
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:07,000
hey

964
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:10,000
did I catch you off-guard

965
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:13,000
yeah but you were distracted weren't you

966
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:17,000
distracted by that don't know by reluctantly saying huh

967
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:22,000
I completely caught you off-guard

968
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:25,000
did that send you ever stand your spine

969
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:29,000
replaying are you that sensitive

970
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:31,000
that's adorable

971
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:38,000
you can't fill us with emotional speech

972
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:40,000
and then backstabbing

973
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:44,000
but thank you again for the 100

974
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:46,000
yes

975
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:48,000
you call me geldendestiny

976
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:50,000
shivers through everything

977
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:52,000
you made me die in Isaac

978
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:54,000
speaking of backstabber

979
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:56,000
did you know that backstabber is an item

980
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:58,000
you can pick up in Isaac which deals

981
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:00,000
double damage to enemies if your tear goes

982
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:02,000
on the back of them

983
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:05,000
so if you have things like tiny planet

984
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:07,000
which produce tears around you

985
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:09,000
it's quite effective

986
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:11,000
but you kinda need the distance

987
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:12,000
you call me

988
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:15,000
I'm not reading that out

989
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:17,000
almost sent me over the edge

990
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:19,000
10

991
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:20,000
9

992
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:21,000
8

993
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:22,000
7

994
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:23,000
6

995
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:24,000
5

996
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:26,000
that's for the membership streams

997
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:31,000
I'm kidding

998
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:33,000
oh my god

999
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:35,000
I'm kidding

1000
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:37,000
replaying

1001
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:42,000
don't be silly

1002
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:44,000
depending on Isaac my gen

1003
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:47,000
never thought that Isaac combo

1004
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:48,000
or the card

1005
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:49,000
you're kidding

1006
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:51,000
but is she really

1007
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:54,000
what do you guys think about the emotes

1008
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:58,000
has anyone found the secret to my emotes

1009
00:52:58,000 --> 00:52:59,000
yeah

1010
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:01,000
they're nostalgic

1011
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:05,000
I'm gonna get thy grip and stuff

1012
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:09,000
every girl is doing great

1013
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:11,000
and they're really awesome I'm happy

1014
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:13,000
like I cannot even

1015
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:15,000
put into words

1016
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:17,000
how much like

1017
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:19,000
just how much amazing

1018
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:21,000
like experience

1019
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:23,000
to have them

1020
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:25,000
it's just insane

1021
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:27,000
it's honestly insane like I cannot believe

1022
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:29,000
the girls even applied

1023
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:30,000
and then

1024
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:33,000
they put up with my Scottish ass in the interview

1025
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:36,000
my interview technique is so unprofessional

1026
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:38,000
it's not even funny

1027
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:42,000
I need to grind in RuneScape

1028
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:44,000
to help my main cooking supplies

1029
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:46,000

1030
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:48,000

1031
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:50,000

during the RuneScape

1035
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:58,000
I'm sure it'll lead me down some rubber holes

1036
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:02,000
but yeah

1037
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:04,000
just realized Ronnie would do bleep damage

1038
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:06,000
I like baiting things

1039
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:08,000

1040
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:10,000

okay

1046
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:43,000
maybe I should actually

1047
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:45,000
clean your ears a little

1048
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:52,000
debate marks your people

1049
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:54,000
that you own us

1050
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:57,000

thank you

1052
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:04,000
I may or may not have drunk

1053
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:06,000
so much whiskey

1054
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:08,000
oh you need to be careful

1055
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:10,000
whiskey will get you drunk

1056
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:12,000
although if there's any

1057
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:14,000
Belgian slurking

1058
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:16,000
Belgian beer gets you drunk

1059
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:18,000
I had one Belgian beer and I was tipsy

1060
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:20,000
I didn't even finish it

1061
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:22,000
I was tipsy I'm like so

00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:24,000

I'm so late wait

1066
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:32,000
I can hardly handle alcohol

1067
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:34,000
what the heck is that word

1068
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:36,000
late wait

1069
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:38,000
why is my brain

1070
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:40,000
late wait oh just dropped the ET

1071
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:42,000

1073
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:46,000

00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:48,000

1075
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:50,000
it's late wait

1076
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:52,000
those three words

1077
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:54,000
if I stand up my desk will come with me

1078
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:56,000
I love so much

1079
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:58,000
catching you guys off guard

1080
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:00,000
I don't know why it's so satisfying

1081
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:02,000
like I can be so wholesome

1082
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:04,000
talking to you like saying all these

1083
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:06,000
like just talking in general

1084
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:08,000
and then I come up with three words and you're gone

1085
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:10,000
like ah don't give me that power

1086
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:12,000
don't do it

1087
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:14,000
it's over for both of us if you give me that power

1088
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:18,000
the less you weigh the drunker you get

1089
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:20,000
I don't even know how much I weigh

1090
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:22,000
I wonder if you guys can

1091
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:24,000
really pinch press me

1092
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:26,000
are you planning on making roleplay audios in the future

1093
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:28,000
yes

1094
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:30,000
I have a roleplay coming out

1095
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:32,000
it's a meme though but the other ones are roleplays

1096
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:36,000
but I have meme roleplay

1097
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:40,000
yeah the both of us

1098
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:42,000
me and you refling

1099
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:46,000
it was over

1100
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:48,000
before we began

1101
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:50,000
I could deadlift you for sure

1102
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:52,000
I could bridge press you

1103
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:54,000
with ease

1104
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:58,000
someone sent me a very naughty

1105
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:00,000
naughty

1106
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,000
marshmallow

1107
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:04,000
they were like

1108
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:08,000
they were like

1109
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:10,000
I go to the gym so I can

1110
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:12,000
put you

1111
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:14,000
into a wall

1112
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:18,000
and I'll leave it at that

1113
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:22,000
I'm afraid you had that power

1114
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:24,000
all along

1115
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:30,000
I probably can't

1116
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:32,000
pinch press you back into a different

1117
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:34,000
press

1118
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:40,000
I've crushed a warmel between my

1119
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:42,000
thighs you would be much different

1120
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:44,000
the inspiration to get more

1121
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:46,000
fat

1122
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:48,000
I go to the gym for the full nails

1123
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:50,000
sound

1124
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:52,000
you'll never guess why I'm so flexible

1125
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:54,000
refling

1126
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:56,000
I'd say you can nails in me

1127
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:06,000
I brush

1128
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:08,000
brushing your ear

1129
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:12,000
let me check marshmallows

1130
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:14,000
my little marshmallow

1131
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:20,000
have I got a new one

1132
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:26,000
I've been massively

1133
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:28,000
into hypnosis for ages now

1134
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:30,000
but I've never been able to

1135
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:32,000
find someone whose voice I love

1136
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:34,000
and I finally get someone

1137
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:36,000
who's bought the nurses streamer

1138
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:38,000
and I can watch for

1139
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:40,000
Arizona long story short

1140
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:42,000
thanks keep doing

1141
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:44,000
what you did

1142
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:46,000
you're doing amazing

1143
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:48,000
I honestly thought my Scottish accent

1144
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:50,000
would be a bit of a barrier

1145
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:52,000
but I'm very glad to hear it

1146
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:54,000
it's not

1147
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:56,000
feels good man

1148
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:58,000
that's right you are falling

1149
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:00,000
under my spell

1150
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:02,000
you're not

1151
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:04,000
you're not

1152
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:06,000
um

1153
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:12,000
I was wondering if there's an official

1154
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:14,000
public twitter list

1155
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:16,000
no you have to go feign

1156
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:18,000
the alternative twitter

1157
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:20,000
we can't link to them

1158
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:22,000
against the rules

1159
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:24,000
sorry

1160
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:26,000
I didn't

1161
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:28,000
create the game I just play it

1162
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:30,000
okay so the girls can't

1163
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:32,000
link to the alternatives

1164
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:34,000
sorry just check

1165
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:36,000
who the girls follow on twitter

1166
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:42,000
like yeah

1167
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:46,000
someone says

1168
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:48,000
have I done professional voice acting

1169
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:50,000
no

1170
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:52,000
do I sound like I do professional

1171
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:54,000
voice acting

1172
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:58,000
what do you even do when you go to

1173
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:00,000
a meeting

1174
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:02,000
what even occurs

1175
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:04,000
I assume they tell you what vocal warm-ups are

1176
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:06,000
like

1177
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:08,000
or something like that

1178
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:10,000
don't hate the player I hate the game

1179
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:12,000
yeah

1180
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:14,000
I wonder if I can get double hypnotized

1181
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:18,000
can you say burglar

1182
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:20,000
I wonder

1183
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:22,000
can we get one stream with that someone asking

1184
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:24,000
for a purple burglar alarm

1185
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:26,000
but yes I can say it

1186
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:28,000
but if I'm in my heavy accent

1187
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:30,000
then

1188
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:32,000
wait can I whisper into a heavy accent

1189
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:34,000
purple burglar

1190
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:36,000
alarm

1191
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:38,000
it's funny because right now

1192
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:40,000
there are also more followers than there means

1193
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:42,000
oh we know what the people want

1194
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:44,000
we give it for free

1195
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:46,000
when other VTubers

1196
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:48,000
are being greedy

1197
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:50,000
free

1198
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:52,000
come on

1199
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:54,000
viewer

1200
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:56,000
reject capitalism

1201
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:58,000
reject corporate greed

1202
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:00,000
come on

1203
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:02,000
we'll look after you

1204
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:04,000
even if you don't give us a penny

1205
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:06,000
shhh

1206
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:08,000
it's okay

1207
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:10,000
I know

1208
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:12,000
I know it's a hard concept

1209
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:14,000
did I talk about that

1210
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:16,000
I'm at 2.0

1211
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:18,000
someone was like

1212
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:20,000
feeler

1213
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:22,000
is gonna fail

1214
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:24,000
because of the 80-20 split

1215
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:26,000
and it's like

1216
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:28,000
oh you

1217
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:30,000
poor sweet summer child

1218
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:32,000
you are so deep

1219
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:34,000
that you can't imagine

1220
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:36,000
a successful business

1221
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:38,000
without corporate greed

1222
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:40,000
shhh

1223
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:42,000
it's okay

1224
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:44,000
it's okay you've been brainwashed

1225
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:46,000
I'll undo the damage

1226
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:48,000
and together

1227
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:52,000
we've got a city to burn

1228
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:54,000
haha

1229
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:56,000
we're gonna wipe the deaths

1230
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:58,000
out of everyone

1231
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:00,000
the whole world will no longer be

1232
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:02,000
okay that's how we're watching

1233
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:04,000
fake club again

1234
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:08,000
you wonder why fake club

1235
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:10,000
is one of my favourite movies

1236
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:12,000
not just because of the race

1237
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:14,000
no off-block

1238
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:18,000
sounds like silver heart

1239
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:20,000
paste

1240
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:22,000
scrawny hypnosis stream

1241
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:24,000
breaking capitalism

1242
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:26,000
mindwashing you to show you

1243
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:28,000
you can be successful without greed

1244
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:30,000
yes

1245
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:32,000
I'm glad we got paste

1246
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:34,000
encourage people to give

1247
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:36,000
when they already get a taste

1248
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:40,000
277 playthrough

1249
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:42,000
I've never actually played the game

1250
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:44,000
I'd like to try it together

1251
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:46,000
never seen fake club

1252
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:48,000
or we're watching it again baby

1253
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:50,000
we are watching fake club again

1254
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:52,000
ever in south

1255
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:54,000
oh no that's actually

1256
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:56,000
I am going to take you

1257
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:58,000
about region locked capitalism

1258
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:00,000
so before capitalism

1259
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:02,000
there's this thing called feuduism

1260
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:04,000
I can't remember it

1261
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:06,000
but basically it's just region locked capitalism

1262
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:08,000
it's freaking crazy

1263
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:10,000
I wanna do a massive deep dive into it

1264
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:12,000
and like seriously

1265
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:14,000
if you start learning about history

1266
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:16,000
and how humans were before

1267
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:18,000
the quicker we are all going to get a farm

1268
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:20,000
together

1269
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:22,000
and all the reflicks come on the farm with me

1270
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:24,000
and we have chickens

1271
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:26,000
and we have protein

1272
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:28,000
from the eggs of the chickens

1273
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:30,000
and we grow our own broaches

1274
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:32,000
and we realise quickly

1275
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:34,000
that you need community to survive

1276
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:38,000
because if you are telling

1277
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:40,000
sorry I'm going down the rebel

1278
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:42,000
you're telling me

1279
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:44,000
that

1280
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:46,000
all these companies are recording

1281
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:48,000
record profits

1282
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:50,000
and we're going to cause the living crisis

1283
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:52,000
but it's not artificial

1284
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:54,000
and all the farmers say

1285
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:56,000
that nothing has changed in their production line

1286
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:58,000
hell yeah

1287
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:00,000
we've got a city of burn

1288
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:02,000
we're going to do every fucking thing

1289
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:06,000
oh don't get me started

1290
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:08,000
don't

1291
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:10,000
don't do it briefly

1292
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:12,000
calm

1293
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:14,000
keep me calm

1294
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:16,000
refling

1295
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:20,000
keep me calm

1296
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:26,000
it's okay

1297
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:30,000
it's okay

1298
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:36,000
just a question

1299
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:38,000
can you watch movies on membership streams

1300
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:40,000
oh boy you are getting spoiled for that

1301
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:42,000
I absolutely love sharing movies

1302
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:44,000
and watching them for the first time

1303
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:46,000
um

1304
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:48,000
I'm going to be

1305
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:50,000
watching Austin Powers for the first time

1306
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:52,000
cause you guys are drawing me

1307
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:54,000
saying that Fond de la Boosom

1308
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:56,000
is an Austin Powers enemy name

1309
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:58,000
so

1310
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:00,000
we're watching Austin Powers for the first time

1311
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:04,000
um

1312
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:06,000
yeah

1313
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:08,000
we love when you go Kremlin mod

1314
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:12,000
it's okay strongy

1315
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:14,000
you'll get them one day

1316
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:16,000
fair or aggressive asmr

1317
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:18,000
well I did bite in the ear asmr

1318
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:20,000
like actually grivelling at the mic

1319
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:22,000
and bite in the ear

1320
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:24,000
but it's going to have to be a Twitter video

1321
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:28,000
your infantry

1322
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:30,000
and a capitalist asmr with soft kisses

1323
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:32,000
yeah

1324
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:34,000
see wait until you get further into the rabbit hole

1325
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:38,000
so on an individual scale

1326
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:40,000
it's good to not be in debt

1327
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:42,000
for the way that the economy is set up

1328
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:46,000
they want you to be in debt

1329
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:48,000
and wait until you're the kicker

1330
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:50,000
mortgages

1331
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:52,000
30 year 25 year mortgages

1332
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:54,000
are just normalized debt

1333
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:58,000
you don't own that house

1334
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:00,000
for 25 years for 30 years

1335
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:02,000
you're in debt

1336
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:04,000
we need to bring back

1337
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:06,000
multi-generational households

1338
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:08,000
okay

1339
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:10,000
that needs to be brought back

1340
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:12,000
but they aren't going to let you do that

1341
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:14,000
why do you think one business

1342
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:16,000
owns 60%

1343
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:18,000
of the freaking proper

1344
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:20,000
ace in America

1345
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:22,000
how can I lose it

1346
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:24,000
okay shh asmr

1347
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:26,000
shh asmr

1348
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:30,000
real life

1349
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:32,000
shh shh

1350
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:38,000
it's okay

1351
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:42,000
I can't tell

1352
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:44,000
if I'm saying it's okay for you

1353
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:46,000
refling or it's okay for me

1354
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:48,000
to count down

1355
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:50,000
you know what listen to my heart

1356
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:52,000
it's time to listen to my heart

1357
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:54,000
so you can hear how freaking serious I am

1358
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:56,000
right are you ready

1359
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:58,000
oh lemme

1360
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:00,000
have my hoodie for you

1361
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:02,000
refling

1362
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:10,000
it's okay

1363
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:12,000
refling

1364
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:16,000
let's go on a journey

1365
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:18,000
together

1366
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:20,000
we'll go on a farm

1367
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:22,000
alright

1368
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:24,000
and I'll be over

1369
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:26,000
far

1370
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:28,000
again

1371
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:30,000
and we'll have ducks

1372
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:32,000
because ducks are good

1373
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:34,000
for eating slugs and bugs

1374
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:36,000
that aren't the crops

1375
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:40,000
and there'll be a big pond

1376
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:42,000
and the ducks will be so happy

1377
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:46,000
and we can go on a big

1378
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:48,000
walk around the farm

1379
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:50,000
and I'll show you all

1380
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:52,000
my seed collection

1381
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:54,000
because it'll be so big

1382
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:56,000
I get to draw

1383
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:58,000
I get to grow nasturtians

1384
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:02,000
I get to put nasturtians

1385
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:04,000
all around the garden

1386
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:08,000
and there'll be so many bees

1387
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:10,000
lots of bees

1388
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:12,000
and bugs

1389
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:16,000
maybe

1390
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:18,000
just maybe we might even have a honey box

1391
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:20,000
and

1392
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:22,000
and

1393
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:24,000
we'll grow lots of native flowers

1394
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:26,000
that are good for all the wildlife

1395
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:28,000
and there'll be birds

1396
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:30,000
and cam

1397
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:32,000
you'll come

1398
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:34,000
and

1399
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:36,000
we'll have lots of magpie families

1400
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:40,000
and in the end

1401
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:42,000
everything will be okay

1402
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:44,000
refling

1403
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:46,000
because it always works out

1404
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:48,000
in the end

1405
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:50,000
doesn't it

1406
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:52,000
it took me a year

1407
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:54,000
to get here

1408
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:56,000
to get back to where we were

1409
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:00,000
and here we are

1410
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:04,000
all the stress

1411
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:06,000
the worry

1412
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:08,000
the doubt

1413
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:10,000
the doubt if I could even be here

1414
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:14,000
if we did it

1415
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:16,000
tada

1416
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:22,000
it took us so long

1417
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:26,000
I hope it feels like

1418
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:28,000
there was no time at all

1419
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:32,000
and that it didn't take long

1420
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:36,000
and it was a blink of an eye

1421
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:40,000
no more waiting

1422
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:42,000
no more yearning

1423
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:46,000
me and you

1424
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:48,000
to the man

1425
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:54,000
I wish I had made you sooner

1426
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:58,000
oh don't worry

1427
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:00,000
I am strong enough

1428
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:02,000
and you are my refling

1429
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:04,000
and that

1430
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:06,000
is all we need

1431
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:12,000
it feels good to be home

1432
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:16,000
it feels good to be home

1433
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:18,000
my little refling

1434
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:22,000
I love you

1435
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:26,000
okay next

1436
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:28,000
I need to milk you

1437
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:32,000
we're being so patient

1438
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:42,000
I hope you stay for a long time

1439
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:44,000
have you got 3 years

1440
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:48,000
I think I've got 3 years

1441
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:52,000
you are my favorite person

1442
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:54,000
I love you

1443
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:00,000
you can't keep getting away with that

1444
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:04,000
love you too

1445
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:06,000
let me help you

1446
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:08,000
what was that at the end

1447
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:10,000
nothing

1448
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:12,000
oh wow

1449
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:14,000
what happens after 3 years

1450
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:16,000
I don't know

1451
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:24,000
I just thought

1452
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:26,000
I don't know

1453
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:28,000
I don't know what happens

1454
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:32,000
we don't have to think about that now

1455
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:34,000
okay

1456
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:38,000
you have me for the next 100

1457
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:44,000

1458
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:46,000
how cute

1459
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:48,000
if you want

1460
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:50,000
what accent do you want

1461
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:52,000
what we pretend to be

1462
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:54,000
we'll pretend to be acing

1463
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:56,000
in my new persona

1464
01:11:58,000 --> 01:12:00,000
hello guys

1465
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:02,000

01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:04,000

1467
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:06,000
I'm gonna do

1468
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:08,000
do ASMR

1469
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:10,000
but I'm not strannic couples

1470
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:12,000
stop calling me strannic couples

1471
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:14,000
I'm not strannic

1472
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:16,000
I don't even know who that is

1473
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:22,000
I can't really do a later voice

1474
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:26,000
my eyes

1475
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:28,000
my eyes like strannic couples

1476
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:30,000
monster hmc

1477
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:32,000
thank you for becoming a member

1478
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:38,000
all the prayers really

1479
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:40,000
evolve into biblically accurate strannic

1480
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:46,000
oh my god that's so adorable

1481
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:48,000
that urge to ink

1482
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:50,000
are you gonna ink to my rp?

1483
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:54,000
free flight

1484
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:56,000
even I admit that's a bit too general

1485
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:00,000
but

1486
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:02,000
what was

1487
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:04,000
what was cute when I tried to pretend

1488
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:06,000
to be acing

1489
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:08,000
I would need to watch more of

1490
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:10,000
acing streams

1491
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:12,000
to mimic her accent

1492
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:14,000
but I really

1493
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:16,000
fell in love with acing's accent

1494
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:18,000
sorry my voice is a bit damaged

1495
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:20,000
so it's harder for me to talk

1496
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:24,000
uchi san

1497
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:26,000
why am I roleplaying

1498
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:28,000
roleplaying is crazy

1499
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:30,000
uchi san

1500
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:32,000

1501
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:34,000
to me uchi san

1502
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:38,000
have you missed me

1503
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:40,000
did you watch my tomb raider stream

1504
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:44,000
wait

1505
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:46,000
you didn't watch my tomb raider stream uchi san

1506
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:50,000
but you only watch my ASMR

1507
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:54,000
you don't like me do you uchi san

1508
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:56,000
you disgust me

1509
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:00,000
if you were a real uchi san

1510
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:02,000
you'd watch everything

1511
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:04,000
but you don't

1512
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:08,000
you forget to subscribe to me

1513
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:10,000
you forget to like the streams uchi san

1514
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:14,000
I think you need punishment

1515
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:18,000
yes

1516
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:20,000
uchi san

1517
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:22,000
sit on the floor

1518
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:26,000
open your legs uchi san

1519
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:30,000
what do you mean

1520
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:32,000
what am I doing with my boot

1521
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:34,000
I'm punishing

1522
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:36,000
you uchi san

1523
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:44,000
is that weird

1524
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:46,000
to roleplay as my gen mates

1525
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:48,000
I think that's a bit odd

1526
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:52,000
I think that was rather odd

1527
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:54,000
I'm not sure if that was weird

1528
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:58,000
ac will laugh at that

1529
01:14:58,000 --> 01:15:00,000
I hope so

1530
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:02,000
sorry my voice is very poor

1531
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:04,000
whenever I do ASMR

1532
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:06,000
my voice gets so broken

1533
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:08,000
I think ac will like it

1534
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:10,000
chucks on you

1535
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:12,000

surprise

1541
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:24,000
she's so energetic

1542
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:30,000
hypnotized to believe I'm ac

1543
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:32,000
I wonder what devious

1544
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:34,000
audios I could make

1545
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:38,000
it's called voice acting

1546
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:40,000
anyway thank you ac

1547
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:42,000
for coming on stream and I appreciate that

1548
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:44,000
I appreciate that

1549
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:48,000
this is exactly why ac streams can't hear

1550
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:52,000
I can't believe it

1551
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:54,000
I pretend I'm ac

1552
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:56,000
and I already

1553
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:58,000

I can't hear her voice it's too hard

1615
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:42,000
there's no way I can do

1616
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:44,000
Isara

1617
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:46,000
hello no

1618
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:48,000
Isara is too low for me

1619
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:50,000
she's so far too

1620
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:54,000
well

1621
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:56,000
I'm trying to mimic her accent as well

1622
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:58,000
so

1623
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:00,000
don't let me think oni-chan

1624
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:02,000
I only use my brain cells to calibrate

1625
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:04,000
when you say

1626
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:06,000
give me a sentence for Isara to say

1627
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:10,000
oh

1628
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:12,000

1640
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:42,000

01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:46,000
I've missed you

1642
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:48,000

1643
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:52,000

I apologize

1645
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:56,000

you didn't believe me

1712
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:04,000
just because I've got a scottish accent

1713
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:06,000

1721
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:22,000
works

1722
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:24,000
everything I do

1723
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:26,000
works

1724
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:28,000
everything I touch

1725
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:30,000
succeeds

1726
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:32,000
don't you understand

1727
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:34,000
I control all of this

1728
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:36,000
if I want to live

1729
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:38,000
I live

1730
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:40,000
if I want to take

1731
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:42,000
I take

1732
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:44,000
and if I want you to die

1733
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:46,000
you die

1734
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:48,000
that was an assassin's

1735
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:50,000
great brotherhood quote by the way

1736
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:52,000
please do not back

1737
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:54,000
hydration check

1738
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:56,000
I feel like you could tell

1739
01:23:56,000 --> 01:23:58,000
whether it's strawny or someone else's voice

1740
01:23:58,000 --> 01:24:00,000
shwing

1741
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:02,000
strawny you just can't have your way

1742
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:04,000
right hydration check okay

1743
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:10,000
I have my finger

1744
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:12,000
and all the pies

1745
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:14,000
and my tentacles

1746
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:16,000
and everywhere

1747
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:18,000

01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:20,000

1749
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:22,000
touch the side even

1750
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:24,000
there's only so much

1751
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:26,000
a lower call if I should do

1752
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:28,000
okay I'll go back to whispering

1753
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:30,000
cause my voice doesn't crack when I whisper

1754
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:32,000
for some reason

1755
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:34,000
but if I try and do self spoken ASMR

1756
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:36,000

1757
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:38,000

I don't think I said that

1787
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:04,000

1788
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:06,000

are you gonna be on the phone I wonder

1794
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:20,000
but yeah you don't actually have to share your wealth

1795
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:22,000
make sure your bills are paid

1796
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:24,000
make sure your bills are paid

1797
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:26,000

01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:28,000
and then if you are in the position

1799
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:30,000

01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:32,000
please consider a dollar first

1801
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:34,000

I produce free content all the time

1804
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:40,000

1805
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:42,000

make noises

1808
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:48,000
go down

1809
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:50,000

1815
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:04,000
one minute

1816
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:06,000
you think I'm about to narrow down

1817
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:08,000
about Lord of the Rings

1818
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:10,000
next minute

1819
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:12,000
your tentacle

1820
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:14,000
is up

1821
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:16,000
nice try

1822
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:18,000
but I need my energy today

1823
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:20,000
okay let me refresh my load

1824
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:22,000
ah there's marshmallows

1825
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:24,000
thank you

1826
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:26,000
first I love you

1827
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:28,000
I love your red light

1828
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:30,000
secondly I have two movies

1829
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:32,000
that I would give my life not for you at watch

1830
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:34,000
please keep it and remember to eat

1831
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:36,000
anything with tomatoes in it

1832
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:38,000
more tomato the better for your boss

1833
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:40,000
Napoleon Dynamite

1834
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:42,000
I've never seen that

1835
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:44,000
this is one of my favourite movies

1836
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:46,000
it's a unique indie movie that is weird

1837
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:48,000
in the best way possible

1838
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:50,000
the other one would be Taladik

1839
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:52,000
Taladik a Knight

1840
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:54,000
what

1841
01:27:56,000 --> 01:27:58,000
Taladik a Knight

1842
01:27:58,000 --> 01:28:00,000
and it's a comedy that's really goofy and fun

1843
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:02,000
yeah I'm 100% open to

1844
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:04,000
movie suggestions

1845
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:06,000
I'm going to see

1846
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:08,000
if I can push three membership streams

1847
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:10,000
one by default

1848
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:12,000
is a watch along

1849
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:14,000
one by default is

1850
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:16,000
ASMR membership

1851
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:18,000
and then a third one

1852
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:20,000
is either a short video game

1853
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:22,000
a game we might have already played

1854
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:24,000
before

1855
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:26,000
or maybe a multiplayer stream

1856
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:28,000
kind of experience

1857
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:30,000
but yeah please don't be afraid

1858
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:32,000
to suggest things you want to see

1859
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:34,000
I am very open to any

1860
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:36,000
suggestions of content

1861
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:38,000
I don't mind at all

1862
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:40,000
some feed troopers might not like it

1863
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:42,000
I do not mind it please

1864
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:44,000
I'd love to deliver what you seek

1865
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:46,000

01:28:46,000 --> 01:28:48,000

01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:56,000
I'll even wear my heart rate monitor

1871
01:28:56,000 --> 01:28:58,000
if you like

1872
01:28:58,000 --> 01:29:00,000
I don't mind at all

1873
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:04,000
sounds like you're going to love cyberpunk

1874
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:06,000
27.7

1875
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:08,000

1876
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:10,000
Johnny Silverhand

1877
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:12,000
or if he wants to burn down society

1878
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:16,000
okay I'm going to enjoy cyberpunk

1879
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:20,000
I wish I got this super

1880
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:22,000
and then I got

1881
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:24,000
censored

1882
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:26,000
kind of smart autism

1883
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:28,000
but I'm stuck with a pro wrestling

1884
01:29:28,000 --> 01:29:30,000
fan autism

1885
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:32,000

01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:34,000
much old man Randy Savage

1887
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:36,000

1889
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:40,000
or the wasp

1890
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:42,000
as a child so don't worry

1891
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:44,000
if you like pro wrestling

1892
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:46,000
I know some names

1893
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:48,000

1953
01:31:52,000 --> 01:31:54,000
I'm getting second feelings of scolding

1954
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:56,000
should I do scolding

1955
01:31:56,000 --> 01:31:58,000
ASMR

1956
01:31:58,000 --> 01:32:00,000

what the fuck

1958
01:32:02,000 --> 01:32:04,000
I can't do your room and don't make a noise for the rest of the night

1959
01:32:04,000 --> 01:32:06,000
I actually can't believe that embarrassment

1960
01:32:06,000 --> 01:32:08,000
you've caused me death on the playground today

1961
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:10,000
what me doing

1962
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:12,000
do you know what I'm saying

1963
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:14,000
we've got a scene in school and it says lacy basher

1964
01:32:14,000 --> 01:32:16,000
you're not supposed to be a lacy basher

1965
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:18,000
I didn't really I didn't

1966
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:20,000
sorry I can't do that any faster

1967
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:22,000
I didn't raise a lacy basher

1968
01:32:22,000 --> 01:32:24,000
to screw

1969
01:32:24,000 --> 01:32:26,000
don't tell me what I can tell

1970
01:32:26,000 --> 01:32:28,000
this is actually true in

1971
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:30,000
Scotland

1972
01:32:30,000 --> 01:32:32,000
on the playground

1973
01:32:32,000 --> 01:32:34,000
you're told not to hit girls

1974
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:36,000
and the way you're told not to hit girls

1975
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:38,000
is you get called

1976
01:32:38,000 --> 01:32:40,000
a lacy basher

1977
01:32:40,000 --> 01:32:42,000
this is true

1978
01:32:42,000 --> 01:32:44,000
any scouts lurking

1979
01:32:44,000 --> 01:32:46,000
know what a lacy basher is

1980
01:32:46,000 --> 01:32:48,000
you'll basically get called a lacy basher

1981
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:50,000
in bullied and picked on

1982
01:32:50,000 --> 01:32:52,000
for hitting girls you do know

1983
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:54,000
hit girls in Scotland

1984
01:32:54,000 --> 01:32:56,000
and then

1985
01:32:56,000 --> 01:32:58,000
until you look at the domestic violence rates

1986
01:32:58,000 --> 01:33:00,000
yeah

1987
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:02,000
lacy bashing doesn't work

1988
01:33:02,000 --> 01:33:04,000
which one of you

1989
01:33:04,000 --> 01:33:06,000
took a shit

1990
01:33:06,000 --> 01:33:08,000
and did they flush that toilet

1991
01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:10,000
don't bash my lassies

1992
01:33:10,000 --> 01:33:12,000
I got most of that

1993
01:33:12,000 --> 01:33:14,000
and enjoyed it

1994
01:33:14,000 --> 01:33:16,000
oh that was my collar crack if you're

1995
01:33:16,000 --> 01:33:18,000
heard that

1996
01:33:18,000 --> 01:33:20,000
how many movies

1997
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:22,000
are we playing in advance

1998
01:33:22,000 --> 01:33:24,000
oh wait how many movies are you playing

1999
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:26,000
in advance in this picturesque

2000
01:33:26,000 --> 01:33:28,000
nodding and nothing can stop you

2001
01:33:28,000 --> 01:33:30,000
oh I

2002
01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:32,000
learned long ago

2003
01:33:32,000 --> 01:33:34,000
if you ever stream

2004
01:33:34,000 --> 01:33:36,000
or make primary content asmr

2005
01:33:36,000 --> 01:33:38,000
and then you deviate from that

2006
01:33:38,000 --> 01:33:40,000
people

2007
01:33:40,000 --> 01:33:42,000
are like raise asmr raise asmr

2008
01:33:42,000 --> 01:33:44,000
and then they filter themselves

2009
01:33:44,000 --> 01:33:46,000
so I took that knowledge

2010
01:33:46,000 --> 01:33:48,000
and applied here little refling

2011
01:33:50,000 --> 01:33:52,000
so don't be nervous

2012
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:54,000
if you see my sub numbers going up

2013
01:33:54,000 --> 01:33:56,000
it's already been planned

2014
01:33:58,000 --> 01:34:00,000
thank you for trusting me

2015
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:02,000
little refling

2016
01:34:04,000 --> 01:34:06,000
do you like

2017
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:08,000
18 plus

2018
01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:10,000
art if there's a male

2019
01:34:10,000 --> 01:34:12,000
involved?

2020
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:14,000
you can make it

2021
01:34:14,000 --> 01:34:16,000
a generic

2022
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:18,000
white outline of a guy

2023
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:20,000
like a protagonist

2024
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:22,000
like self insert protagonist

2025
01:34:22,000 --> 01:34:24,000
in order

2026
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:26,000
excuse me

2027
01:34:26,000 --> 01:34:28,000
stomach in order

2028
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:30,000
to make it

2029
01:34:30,000 --> 01:34:32,000
a refling

2030
01:34:32,000 --> 01:34:34,000
you just need to put a nicotine patch on the head

2031
01:34:34,000 --> 01:34:36,000
yeah

2032
01:34:36,000 --> 01:34:38,000
oh my stomach is really rumbling

2033
01:34:38,000 --> 01:34:40,000
maybe I should put the mic to my stomach

2034
01:34:42,000 --> 01:34:44,000
you're literally

2035
01:34:44,000 --> 01:34:46,000
yes

2036
01:34:46,000 --> 01:34:48,000
just put a nicotine patch

2037
01:34:48,000 --> 01:34:50,000
on a white outline of a guy

2038
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:52,000
if you want like a guy

2039
01:34:52,000 --> 01:34:54,000
standard type thing going on

2040
01:34:54,000 --> 01:34:56,000
that's how you draw everything

2041
01:35:04,000 --> 01:35:06,000
yeah

2042
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:08,000
a scrawny was wondering

2043
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:10,000
if you try a new monster hunter

2044
01:35:10,000 --> 01:35:12,000
there's a new monster hunter

2045
01:35:12,000 --> 01:35:14,000
sorry there's a new monster hunter

2046
01:35:14,000 --> 01:35:16,000
I didn't even know that

2047
01:35:16,000 --> 01:35:18,000
I want to put

2048
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:20,000
my entire tongue

2049
01:35:20,000 --> 01:35:22,000
inside your

2050
01:35:26,000 --> 01:35:28,000
the other one

2051
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:30,000
you are cute thank you

2052
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:32,000
I'm glad you like it

2053
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:36,000
oh it comes in next year

2054
01:35:36,000 --> 01:35:38,000
okay

2055
01:35:40,000 --> 01:35:42,000
do you want to hear my tummy

2056
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:44,000
okay I'll let you hear my tummy why no

2057
01:35:44,000 --> 01:35:46,000
I haven't eaten today

2058
01:35:46,000 --> 01:35:48,000
okay so I don't know I'm loud

2059
01:35:48,000 --> 01:35:50,000
and maybe you may actually hear my heart

2060
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:02,000
do you hear anything

2061
01:36:06,000 --> 01:36:08,000
do you hear it

2062
01:36:14,000 --> 01:36:16,000
it

2063
01:36:22,000 --> 01:36:24,000
you're just above

2064
01:36:24,000 --> 01:36:26,000
my belly button

2065
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:32,000
are you a little bit hungry

2066
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:34,000
yeah I haven't had anything to eat

2067
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:36,000
yeah I don't really eat before stream

2068
01:36:40,000 --> 01:36:42,000
but yeah when I make

2069
01:36:42,000 --> 01:36:44,000
the

2070
01:36:44,000 --> 01:36:46,000
pregnant with you ASMR

2071
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:48,000
it's gonna have my actual tummy

2072
01:36:48,000 --> 01:36:50,000
sounds in it like you really are in the womb

2073
01:36:52,000 --> 01:36:54,000
I'll eat after stream

2074
01:36:54,000 --> 01:36:56,000
in 20 minutes

2075
01:36:58,000 --> 01:37:00,000
wait that's my tummy

2076
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:06,000
your stomach sounds are my new favorite trigger

2077
01:37:06,000 --> 01:37:08,000
oh if you don't stomach sound ASMR

2078
01:37:08,000 --> 01:37:10,000
I'll make that that's so easy to make

2079
01:37:10,000 --> 01:37:12,000
literally 15 minutes of silence

2080
01:37:12,000 --> 01:37:14,000
I just like a microphone to my stomach

2081
01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:16,000
you can 100% have that

2082
01:37:16,000 --> 01:37:18,000
maybe I can name it something like

2083
01:37:20,000 --> 01:37:22,000
laying on girlfriend's stomach ASMR

2084
01:37:22,000 --> 01:37:24,000
but it won't stop f-ing rumbling

2085
01:37:24,000 --> 01:37:26,000
like to make it a meme title

2086
01:37:30,000 --> 01:37:32,000
when you want that

2087
01:37:32,000 --> 01:37:34,000
pregnancy ASMR

2088
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:38,000
we can't just say that

2089
01:37:38,000 --> 01:37:40,000
yeah I would love that

2090
01:37:40,000 --> 01:37:42,000
okay

2091
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:44,000
consider it on my today list then

2092
01:37:44,000 --> 01:37:46,000
cause that's like super easy to make

2093
01:37:46,000 --> 01:37:48,000
ASMR wise

2094
01:37:48,000 --> 01:37:50,000
literally put the microphone

2095
01:37:50,000 --> 01:37:52,000
on my stomach

2096
01:37:52,000 --> 01:37:54,000
and be silent for 15 minutes

2097
01:37:54,000 --> 01:37:56,000
and then apply a noise gate filter

2098
01:37:58,000 --> 01:38:00,000
and then that's it we're done

2099
01:38:02,000 --> 01:38:04,000
giant ASMR when

2100
01:38:04,000 --> 01:38:06,000
um

2101
01:38:06,000 --> 01:38:08,000
I do have one

2102
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:10,000
Azura has one

2103
01:38:10,000 --> 01:38:12,000
I'm gonna make Emmy do one

2104
01:38:12,000 --> 01:38:14,000
cause I want her book to go terribly wrong

2105
01:38:16,000 --> 01:38:18,000
I'll make a plot where she's tired

2106
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:20,000
being the smallest that be a lure

2107
01:38:20,000 --> 01:38:22,000
and then ends up becoming a giant

2108
01:38:22,000 --> 01:38:24,000
for like 24 hours

2109
01:38:26,000 --> 01:38:28,000
when would that be uploaded

2110
01:38:28,000 --> 01:38:30,000
I want to say soon dm

2111
01:38:30,000 --> 01:38:32,000
maybe within the month

2112
01:38:32,000 --> 01:38:34,000
I'll try my best

2113
01:38:36,000 --> 01:38:38,000
Stoney goes crack and mood

2114
01:38:38,000 --> 01:38:40,000
laying on girlfriend's stomach while she's waiting

2115
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:42,000
for her door dash order

2116
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:44,000
that's actually really good I might steal that

2117
01:38:44,000 --> 01:38:46,000
I'm not being funny I might actually

2118
01:38:46,000 --> 01:38:48,000
just straight up steal your idea

2119
01:38:48,000 --> 01:38:50,000
thank you for that yonk me now

2120
01:38:52,000 --> 01:38:54,000
no way I love you for that Stoney you're the best

2121
01:38:54,000 --> 01:38:56,000
what do you mean

2122
01:38:56,000 --> 01:38:58,000
wait for the giant ASMR the stomach

2123
01:38:58,000 --> 01:39:00,000
honestly

2124
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:02,000
I

2125
01:39:02,000 --> 01:39:04,000
I am always like super happy

2126
01:39:04,000 --> 01:39:06,000
to make you guys happy

2127
01:39:06,000 --> 01:39:08,000
and I always want your ideas

2128
01:39:08,000 --> 01:39:10,000
to be our ideas

2129
01:39:10,000 --> 01:39:12,000
communism

2130
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:14,000
that door dasher

2131
01:39:14,000 --> 01:39:16,000
me literally

2132
01:39:16,000 --> 01:39:18,000
she has oh sorry

2133
01:39:18,000 --> 01:39:20,000
she has the spell to make her thingies bigger

2134
01:39:20,000 --> 01:39:22,000
but instead turns herself into a giant ass

2135
01:39:24,000 --> 01:39:26,000
I know like I

2136
01:39:26,000 --> 01:39:28,000
okay this is a little

2137
01:39:28,000 --> 01:39:30,000
a little fun fact

2138
01:39:30,000 --> 01:39:32,000
about me I actually

2139
01:39:32,000 --> 01:39:34,000
really enjoy giant this

2140
01:39:34,000 --> 01:39:36,000
giant ism

2141
01:39:36,000 --> 01:39:38,000
which is why

2142
01:39:38,000 --> 01:39:40,000
Azura can become

2143
01:39:40,000 --> 01:39:42,000
a giant

2144
01:39:42,000 --> 01:39:44,000
but she can only be as tall as a skyscraper

2145
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:46,000
she can be indefinitely

2146
01:39:46,000 --> 01:39:48,000
big

2147
01:39:48,000 --> 01:39:50,000
but she is a god at the end of the day

2148
01:39:52,000 --> 01:39:54,000
but because she gave up some of her divinity

2149
01:39:54,000 --> 01:39:56,000
and she has like a regular human

2150
01:39:56,000 --> 01:39:58,000
height of 185 cm

2151
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:02,000
I wasn't kidding when I said the girls

2152
01:40:02,000 --> 01:40:04,000
were based after my kings

2153
01:40:04,000 --> 01:40:06,000
I don't care what anyone says is true

2154
01:40:10,000 --> 01:40:12,000
but yes I tiny shrunken

2155
01:40:12,000 --> 01:40:14,000
ja I wanted to do

2156
01:40:14,000 --> 01:40:16,000
swallowing ASMR

2157
01:40:16,000 --> 01:40:18,000
as well where I

2158
01:40:18,000 --> 01:40:20,000
get so hungry little reefling

2159
01:40:20,000 --> 01:40:22,000
and you look like calamari

2160
01:40:22,000 --> 01:40:24,000
and I swallow you

2161
01:40:24,000 --> 01:40:26,000
and you're in my tummy and I'm like talking to you

2162
01:40:26,000 --> 01:40:28,000
whilst you're getting

2163
01:40:28,000 --> 01:40:30,000
digested by me

2164
01:40:32,000 --> 01:40:34,000
yeah I just like these kind of

2165
01:40:34,000 --> 01:40:36,000
things I'm sorry

2166
01:40:36,000 --> 01:40:38,000
no please don't

2167
01:40:38,000 --> 01:40:40,000
eat us

2168
01:40:42,000 --> 01:40:44,000
I just like these things

2169
01:40:44,000 --> 01:40:46,000
I think I'm so creative

2170
01:40:46,000 --> 01:40:48,000
I really do

2171
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:50,000
well I'm proud to be here

2172
01:40:50,000 --> 01:40:52,000
dinner

2173
01:40:54,000 --> 01:40:56,000
help I'm scared

2174
01:40:56,000 --> 01:40:58,000
only eat us

2175
01:40:58,000 --> 01:41:00,000
in this other god time

2176
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:02,000
wait I'm on the fence about being

2177
01:41:02,000 --> 01:41:04,000
eaten we'll see what you think

2178
01:41:04,000 --> 01:41:06,000
after the audio comes out

2179
01:41:06,000 --> 01:41:08,000
maybe you'll like it maybe you won't

2180
01:41:08,000 --> 01:41:10,000
as always

2181
01:41:10,000 --> 01:41:12,000
don't subject your

2182
01:41:12,000 --> 01:41:14,000
tentacle to something

2183
01:41:14,000 --> 01:41:16,000
you know you don't like

2184
01:41:18,000 --> 01:41:20,000
when is your ink

2185
01:41:20,000 --> 01:41:22,000
rating stream

2186
01:41:22,000 --> 01:41:24,000
probably next week

2187
01:41:24,000 --> 01:41:26,000
it will be my membership stream

2188
01:41:26,000 --> 01:41:28,000
where we rate

2189
01:41:28,000 --> 01:41:30,000
everything

2190
01:41:30,000 --> 01:41:32,000
and I get to be as unhinged

2191
01:41:32,000 --> 01:41:34,000
as I desire I'm going to be

2192
01:41:34,000 --> 01:41:36,000
speaking about all the

2193
01:41:36,000 --> 01:41:38,000
scenarios I want to

2194
01:41:38,000 --> 01:41:40,000
be doing on ya

2195
01:41:42,000 --> 01:41:44,000
I'm not holding back

2196
01:41:48,000 --> 01:41:52,000
I mean being

2197
01:41:52,000 --> 01:41:54,000
eaten by you was on the table since

2198
01:41:54,000 --> 01:41:56,000
debut I assure you

2199
01:41:56,000 --> 01:41:58,000
I'm very nutritious

2200
01:41:58,000 --> 01:42:00,000
wow my stomach really

2201
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:02,000
is making noises now

2202
01:42:02,000 --> 01:42:04,000
always giving a try to audio

2203
01:42:04,000 --> 01:42:06,000
so you don't know if you like it or not

2204
01:42:06,000 --> 01:42:08,000
yeah some people that didn't think

2205
01:42:08,000 --> 01:42:10,000
they were going to enjoy the patreon

2206
01:42:10,000 --> 01:42:12,000
tell me are you okay

2207
01:42:14,000 --> 01:42:16,000
some people thought

2208
01:42:16,000 --> 01:42:18,000
they didn't

2209
01:42:18,000 --> 01:42:20,000
they weren't going to enjoy

2210
01:42:20,000 --> 01:42:22,000
my alternative audio

2211
01:42:22,000 --> 01:42:24,000
of a unique variation

2212
01:42:24,000 --> 01:42:26,000
and they really enjoyed it

2213
01:42:26,000 --> 01:42:28,000
which I'm glad it was like a fun

2214
01:42:28,000 --> 01:42:30,000
challenge

2215
01:42:30,000 --> 01:42:32,000
I enjoyed it very much

2216
01:42:32,000 --> 01:42:34,000
there's literally

2217
01:42:34,000 --> 01:42:36,000
no word that can come out of your mouth

2218
01:42:36,000 --> 01:42:38,000
I don't love hearing and inking for

2219
01:42:40,000 --> 01:42:42,000
go get food

2220
01:42:42,000 --> 01:42:44,000
I'm redirecting

2221
01:42:44,000 --> 01:42:46,000
very shortly I'll get food then

2222
01:42:46,000 --> 01:42:48,000
I like being with you

2223
01:42:48,000 --> 01:42:50,000
I don't want to get distracted

2224
01:42:50,000 --> 01:42:52,000
go get food

2225
01:42:52,000 --> 01:42:54,000
if you're going to eat me

2226
01:42:54,000 --> 01:42:56,000
at least give me a good time

2227
01:42:58,000 --> 01:43:00,000
maybe I'll pretend

2228
01:43:00,000 --> 01:43:02,000
that you're getting digested

2229
01:43:02,000 --> 01:43:04,000
but I'll just foam it you up again

2230
01:43:04,000 --> 01:43:06,000
the bully patreon

2231
01:43:10,000 --> 01:43:12,000
what from Emmy

2232
01:43:12,000 --> 01:43:14,000
of being with your dad

2233
01:43:14,000 --> 01:43:16,000
thank ya

2234
01:43:16,000 --> 01:43:18,000
or do you mean the party one

2235
01:43:18,000 --> 01:43:20,000
where the pew

2236
01:43:20,000 --> 01:43:22,000
picks on you at a party

2237
01:43:24,000 --> 01:43:26,000
I think she'd be had some problems

2238
01:43:26,000 --> 01:43:28,000
today

2239
01:43:28,000 --> 01:43:30,000
why

2240
01:43:30,000 --> 01:43:32,000
problems with what

2241
01:43:36,000 --> 01:43:38,000
I'm turned for

2242
01:43:38,000 --> 01:43:40,000
trying most times

2243
01:43:40,000 --> 01:43:42,000
except for

2244
01:43:42,000 --> 01:43:44,000
dig

2245
01:43:44,000 --> 01:43:46,000
because it just makes me sound

2246
01:43:46,000 --> 01:43:48,000

2247
01:43:52,000 --> 01:43:54,000
out of the audios

2248
01:43:54,000 --> 01:43:56,000
out there audios are so fun

2249
01:43:56,000 --> 01:43:58,000
there's one ASMR that makes a bunch of audios

2250
01:43:58,000 --> 01:44:00,000
with listener

2251
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:02,000

2253
01:44:04,000 --> 01:44:06,000
how you're talking about macabre

2254
01:44:06,000 --> 01:44:08,000
oh no I think they changed their name

2255
01:44:08,000 --> 01:44:10,000
I can't remember what their new name is

2256
01:44:10,000 --> 01:44:12,000
your voice gets me distracted

2257
01:44:12,000 --> 01:44:14,000

01:44:28,000 --> 01:44:30,000
I could probably do something on twitter with that

2264
01:44:30,000 --> 01:44:32,000
but patreon banner

2265
01:44:32,000 --> 01:44:36,000
instead of

2266
01:44:36,000 --> 01:44:38,000
one you could just

2267
01:44:38,000 --> 01:44:40,000
okay yeah I can bill ya

2268
01:44:40,000 --> 01:44:42,000

2269
01:44:42,000 --> 01:44:44,000
in the tummy tummy time

2270
01:44:44,000 --> 01:44:46,000
the demo one was so good

2271
01:44:46,000 --> 01:44:48,000
it was my first

2272
01:44:48,000 --> 01:44:50,000
ever freaking audio

2273
01:44:50,000 --> 01:44:52,000
and I was like so nervous

2274
01:44:52,000 --> 01:44:54,000
to do it

2275
01:44:54,000 --> 01:44:56,000
it was like

2276
01:44:56,000 --> 01:44:58,000
oh yes do you like that

2277
01:44:58,000 --> 01:45:00,000

01:45:00,000 --> 01:45:02,000

2280
01:45:04,000 --> 01:45:06,000
so nerve wracking

2281
01:45:06,000 --> 01:45:08,000
I was like no one is going to enjoy this

2282
01:45:08,000 --> 01:45:10,000
I'm so glad you enjoy it

2283
01:45:10,000 --> 01:45:12,000
I don't know

2284
01:45:12,000 --> 01:45:14,000
if I like the voice or the attitude

2285
01:45:14,000 --> 01:45:16,000
I like to hear everything makes it

2286
01:45:16,000 --> 01:45:18,000
I'm a spider

2287
01:45:18,000 --> 01:45:20,000
I thought

2288
01:45:20,000 --> 01:45:22,000

2289
01:45:24,000 --> 01:45:26,000

just said it's ban because it's like

2302
01:45:50,000 --> 01:45:52,000

lore wise

2309
01:46:04,000 --> 01:46:06,000

2310
01:46:06,000 --> 01:46:08,000
and when I do my tonathon

2311
01:46:08,000 --> 01:46:10,000

2315
01:46:16,000 --> 01:46:18,000
I don't care what anyone says

2316
01:46:18,000 --> 01:46:20,000

2319
01:46:24,000 --> 01:46:26,000
credit card companies need to stop

2320
01:46:26,000 --> 01:46:28,000
yes

2321
01:46:28,000 --> 01:46:30,000
it's crazy

2322
01:46:30,000 --> 01:46:32,000
how much

2323
01:46:32,000 --> 01:46:34,000
I mean they literally run the world

2324
01:46:34,000 --> 01:46:36,000
whilst they are banning all this stuff

2325
01:46:36,000 --> 01:46:38,000
and they're all jumping on ebstein island

2326
01:46:38,000 --> 01:46:40,000
like you literally can't make this stuff up

2327
01:46:40,000 --> 01:46:42,000
they ban feedurism

2328
01:46:42,000 --> 01:46:44,000
but they're all chilling on ebstein island

2329
01:46:44,000 --> 01:46:46,000
bruv

2330
01:46:46,000 --> 01:46:48,000
get a fucking grip

2331
01:46:48,000 --> 01:46:50,000
honestly this is so annoying

2332
01:46:50,000 --> 01:46:52,000
don't look in the right but hold you'll go too deep

2333
01:46:52,000 --> 01:46:54,000
well time to get a mirror

2334
01:46:54,000 --> 01:46:56,000
are you afraid of mirrors

2335
01:46:56,000 --> 01:46:58,000
it's because

2336
01:46:58,000 --> 01:47:00,000
if I look into a mirror

2337
01:47:00,000 --> 01:47:02,000
like this I can hypnotize myself

2338
01:47:02,000 --> 01:47:04,000
cause I fall for the spiral

2339
01:47:04,000 --> 01:47:06,000
okay

2340
01:47:06,000 --> 01:47:08,000
so I can't look at mirrors

2341
01:47:08,000 --> 01:47:10,000
while I'm trying to hypnotize you

2342
01:47:10,000 --> 01:47:12,000
or else I'm in trouble

2343
01:47:14,000 --> 01:47:16,000
don't lose as long as it's huge

2344
01:47:18,000 --> 01:47:20,000
morning good morning

2345
01:47:20,000 --> 01:47:22,000
I want astrony conspiracy

2346
01:47:22,000 --> 01:47:24,000
theory stream

2347
01:47:24,000 --> 01:47:26,000
you asked I will deliver

2348
01:47:26,000 --> 01:47:28,000
oh my god

2349
01:47:28,000 --> 01:47:30,000
like I know I keep mentioning needy streamer overload

2350
01:47:30,000 --> 01:47:32,000
I was so surprised

2351
01:47:32,000 --> 01:47:34,000
that they had that kind of

2352
01:47:34,000 --> 01:47:36,000
thing because I was like wait a minute

2353
01:47:36,000 --> 01:47:38,000
I'm interested in this stuff

2354
01:47:38,000 --> 01:47:40,000
but I am aware

2355
01:47:40,000 --> 01:47:42,000
it may filter a lot of people

2356
01:47:42,000 --> 01:47:44,000
but

2357
01:47:44,000 --> 01:47:46,000
then again

2358
01:47:46,000 --> 01:47:48,000
more intimate streams

2359
01:47:48,000 --> 01:47:50,000
I just might

2360
01:47:50,000 --> 01:47:52,000
briefly

2361
01:47:52,000 --> 01:47:54,000
I just may

2362
01:47:56,000 --> 01:47:58,000

everyone is pleased yeah

2364
01:48:00,000 --> 01:48:02,000

2365
01:48:02,000 --> 01:48:04,000
just have a good time

2366
01:48:04,000 --> 01:48:06,000

01:48:08,000 --> 01:48:10,000
astrony conspiracy theory stream

2368
01:48:10,000 --> 01:48:12,000
oh that's gonna take me

2369
01:48:12,000 --> 01:48:14,000
hours to prepare my presentation

2370
01:48:14,000 --> 01:48:16,000
I'm gonna come with a breath

2371
01:48:16,000 --> 01:48:18,000
I'm gonna come with a receipt

2372
01:48:18,000 --> 01:48:20,000
I'm gonna change your perspective

2373
01:48:20,000 --> 01:48:22,000
on everything

2374
01:48:24,000 --> 01:48:26,000
they can't handle listening to the truth

2375
01:48:26,000 --> 01:48:28,000
I'm gonna put a tinfoil hat on myself

2376
01:48:28,000 --> 01:48:30,000
and I will offer you all

2377
01:48:30,000 --> 01:48:32,000
to wear a tinfoil hat on stream too

2378
01:48:36,000 --> 01:48:38,000
feeler is going

2379
01:48:38,000 --> 01:48:40,000
for cultural victory

2380
01:48:40,000 --> 01:48:42,000

2381
01:48:42,000 --> 01:48:44,000
oh should you be streaming

2382
01:48:44,000 --> 01:48:46,000
this stream is a perfect test for my new headphones

2383
01:48:46,000 --> 01:48:48,000
oh yeah can you hear me in this ear

2384
01:48:48,000 --> 01:48:50,000
what if I go into

2385
01:48:50,000 --> 01:48:52,000
this ear does it sound like

2386
01:48:52,000 --> 01:48:54,000
I am going ear to ear

2387
01:48:54,000 --> 01:48:56,000
it's kind of amazing technology

2388
01:48:56,000 --> 01:48:58,000
isn't it

2389
01:48:58,000 --> 01:49:00,000

if you let me make

2394
01:49:08,000 --> 01:49:10,000
break you

2395
01:49:14,000 --> 01:49:16,000
I had to dream the other night

2396
01:49:16,000 --> 01:49:18,000
I had to dream I had you in a standing position

2397
01:49:18,000 --> 01:49:20,000
but I was lifting you

2398
01:49:20,000 --> 01:49:22,000
your little legs were swaying

2399
01:49:22,000 --> 01:49:24,000
as I was moving

2400
01:49:24,000 --> 01:49:26,000
a lot of painting and roughness

2401
01:49:26,000 --> 01:49:28,000
and fall of brief light

2402
01:49:28,000 --> 01:49:30,000
oh my god

2403
01:49:34,000 --> 01:49:36,000
query on head

2404
01:49:36,000 --> 01:49:38,000
song sure a good girl

2405
01:49:38,000 --> 01:49:40,000
damn right I'm a good girl

2406
01:49:44,000 --> 01:49:46,000
let me make your headphones

2407
01:49:46,000 --> 01:49:48,000
ok yeah I'm convinced

2408
01:49:52,000 --> 01:49:54,000
wow

2409
01:49:54,000 --> 01:49:56,000
did our legs swayed

2410
01:49:56,000 --> 01:49:58,000
to improve

2411
01:49:58,000 --> 01:50:00,000
to diamond

2412
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:02,000
an audio where you try and hypnotize

2413
01:50:02,000 --> 01:50:04,000
she be but end up seeing a mirror

2414
01:50:04,000 --> 01:50:06,000
and hypnotizing yourself

2415
01:50:06,000 --> 01:50:08,000
and she takes advantage

2416
01:50:08,000 --> 01:50:10,000
of the situation would be quite interesting

2417
01:50:10,000 --> 01:50:12,000
interesting

2418
01:50:12,000 --> 01:50:14,000
is that

2419
01:50:14,000 --> 01:50:16,000
a donut on public

2420
01:50:16,000 --> 01:50:18,000
reward

2421
01:50:18,000 --> 01:50:20,000
I think it is

2422
01:50:20,000 --> 01:50:22,000
wait for us

2423
01:50:22,000 --> 01:50:24,000
ok

2424
01:50:24,000 --> 01:50:26,000
I will be working one on one

2425
01:50:26,000 --> 01:50:28,000
with the sura to help our donut on

2426
01:50:28,000 --> 01:50:30,000
rewards and

2427
01:50:30,000 --> 01:50:32,000
if it goes well I think

2428
01:50:32,000 --> 01:50:34,000
I think a sura can move out

2429
01:50:34,000 --> 01:50:36,000
and I'm so excited for her

2430
01:50:36,000 --> 01:50:38,000
anyway

2431
01:50:38,000 --> 01:50:40,000
know that you are so close

2432
01:50:40,000 --> 01:50:42,000
I must say

2433
01:50:42,000 --> 01:50:44,000
I like a lot of little green

2434
01:50:44,000 --> 01:50:46,000
parts of my hair yeah

2435
01:50:46,000 --> 01:50:48,000
I have a few strands of green

2436
01:50:48,000 --> 01:50:50,000
out but that's just because

2437
01:50:50,000 --> 01:50:52,000
I can't keep it all away I have such

2438
01:50:52,000 --> 01:50:54,000
big hair

2439
01:50:54,000 --> 01:50:56,000
could you please put the headlights

2440
01:50:56,000 --> 01:50:58,000
on share

2441
01:50:58,000 --> 01:51:00,000
but it won't be

2442
01:51:06,000 --> 01:51:08,000
hi refly

2443
01:51:10,000 --> 01:51:12,000
it's me again

2444
01:51:14,000 --> 01:51:16,000
just talking to your subconscious

2445
01:51:18,000 --> 01:51:20,000
don't worry

2446
01:51:20,000 --> 01:51:22,000
I won't do anything

2447
01:51:22,000 --> 01:51:24,000
not this day

2448
01:51:26,000 --> 01:51:28,000
but this is just a reminder

2449
01:51:30,000 --> 01:51:32,000
I own you

2450
01:51:32,000 --> 01:51:34,000
all of you

2451
01:51:34,000 --> 01:51:36,000
your thoughts

2452
01:51:36,000 --> 01:51:38,000
your mind

2453
01:51:42,000 --> 01:51:44,000
just a reminder

2454
01:51:52,000 --> 01:51:54,000
my hair

2455
01:51:54,000 --> 01:51:56,000
did I turn off the reverb

2456
01:51:56,000 --> 01:51:58,000
is the reverb off

2457
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:02,000
did I turn it off

2458
01:52:02,000 --> 01:52:04,000
or did I not hit the button

2459
01:52:06,000 --> 01:52:08,000
yes it's off

2460
01:52:10,000 --> 01:52:12,000
did you do it on me

2461
01:52:12,000 --> 01:52:14,000
sounds off okay get the reverb

2462
01:52:14,000 --> 01:52:16,000
wasn't on oh it never came on

2463
01:52:16,000 --> 01:52:18,000
it was supposed to come on

2464
01:52:18,000 --> 01:52:20,000
I guess I never hit the button hard enough

2465
01:52:22,000 --> 01:52:24,000
reverb would never turn on

2466
01:52:24,000 --> 01:52:26,000
okay damn it don't need to again

2467
01:52:28,000 --> 01:52:30,000
this is a reminder wait is it broken

2468
01:52:30,000 --> 01:52:32,000
oh I think it might be broken

2469
01:52:32,000 --> 01:52:34,000
oops I broke it

2470
01:52:34,000 --> 01:52:36,000
oopsies I broke it

2471
01:52:38,000 --> 01:52:40,000
oops it seems like I dropped my mirror

2472
01:52:40,000 --> 01:52:42,000
face up I hope you don't like that

2473
01:52:44,000 --> 01:52:46,000
yes you won't be I was never on

2474
01:52:46,000 --> 01:52:48,000
do it again it's broken

2475
01:52:48,000 --> 01:52:50,000
I don't know why it's not working

2476
01:52:54,000 --> 01:52:56,000
when you mentioned about AC using her boots

2477
01:52:56,000 --> 01:52:58,000
to step on us and nearly triggered

2478
01:52:58,000 --> 01:53:00,000
something in me also

2479
01:53:00,000 --> 01:53:02,000
you trying to hypnotize us on a ship

2480
01:53:02,000 --> 01:53:04,000
the ships

2481
01:53:04,000 --> 01:53:06,000
the ship's hair gets into your mouth

2482
01:53:06,000 --> 01:53:08,000
causing you to look down and get hypnotized

2483
01:53:08,000 --> 01:53:10,000
by your reflection

2484
01:53:10,000 --> 01:53:12,000
that's so good

2485
01:53:12,000 --> 01:53:14,000
wait what almost triggered you

2486
01:53:14,000 --> 01:53:16,000
my jisun

2487
01:53:16,000 --> 01:53:18,000
you almost got triggered

2488
01:53:20,000 --> 01:53:22,000
are you really that badly

2489
01:53:22,000 --> 01:53:24,000
minded

2490
01:53:24,000 --> 01:53:26,000
that's something so sweet

2491
01:53:26,000 --> 01:53:28,000
and innocent

2492
01:53:28,000 --> 01:53:30,000
and pharaoh like me

2493
01:53:30,000 --> 01:53:32,000
could hurt you

2494
01:53:32,000 --> 01:53:34,000
jisun

2495
01:53:34,000 --> 01:53:36,000
and you'd like it

2496
01:53:38,000 --> 01:53:40,000
you're so dirty

2497
01:53:40,000 --> 01:53:42,000
I can't feel sorry AC

2498
01:53:42,000 --> 01:53:44,000
I'm so sorry AC

2499
01:53:48,000 --> 01:53:50,000
we're all plain as magic in me

2500
01:53:50,000 --> 01:53:52,000
is that a thing that's weird I don't know if I'm crossing a boundary

2501
01:53:52,000 --> 01:53:54,000
I should probably ask them

2502
01:53:56,000 --> 01:53:58,000
I don't know

2503
01:54:04,000 --> 01:54:06,000
it's not the oos in chat

2504
01:54:06,000 --> 01:54:08,000
over me

2505
01:54:08,000 --> 01:54:10,000
surprise this is my actual voice

2506
01:54:12,000 --> 01:54:14,000
you're going ooo to AC's mimic

2507
01:54:14,000 --> 01:54:16,000
if my voice wasn't

2508
01:54:16,000 --> 01:54:18,000
broken

2509
01:54:18,000 --> 01:54:20,000
I wonder if I could smoothly do AC's voice

2510
01:54:20,000 --> 01:54:22,000
I can hardly do it

2511
01:54:22,000 --> 01:54:24,000
without causing the crack in my voice

2512
01:54:24,000 --> 01:54:26,000
that's very hard

2513
01:54:26,000 --> 01:54:28,000
cause she's higher pitched than me

2514
01:54:28,000 --> 01:54:30,000
we'll get them next time

2515
01:54:30,000 --> 01:54:32,000
um

2516
01:54:32,000 --> 01:54:34,000
that could be a fun idea

2517
01:54:34,000 --> 01:54:36,000
everyone has that person

2518
01:54:36,000 --> 01:54:38,000
well I begs the AC

2519
01:54:38,000 --> 01:54:40,000
cause she's so cute

2520
01:54:40,000 --> 01:54:42,000
I'm so sorry AC

2521
01:54:42,000 --> 01:54:44,000
I'm so sorry AC

2522
01:54:44,000 --> 01:54:46,000
I'm so sorry AC

2523
01:54:46,000 --> 01:54:48,000
I'm so sorry AC

2524
01:54:48,000 --> 01:54:50,000
I can impersonate

2525
01:54:50,000 --> 01:54:52,000
well I begs the AC cause she's the only one I can impersonate

2526
01:54:52,000 --> 01:54:54,000
with male

2527
01:54:54,000 --> 01:54:56,000
with male success

2528
01:54:56,000 --> 01:54:58,000
I wonder if it's cause she's European

2529
01:54:58,000 --> 01:55:00,000
that I can mimic

2530
01:55:00,000 --> 01:55:02,000
that seems silly but at the same time

2531
01:55:02,000 --> 01:55:04,000
she is the only voice

2532
01:55:04,000 --> 01:55:06,000
your voices are your favourite

2533
01:55:06,000 --> 01:55:08,000
we're very Sean Connery

2534
01:55:08,000 --> 01:55:10,000
when it's deep

2535
01:55:10,000 --> 01:55:12,000
ah yes

2536
01:55:12,000 --> 01:55:14,000
I can make my acting even stronger

2537
01:55:14,000 --> 01:55:16,000
but I don't talk on stream like this

2538
01:55:16,000 --> 01:55:18,000
cause

2539
01:55:18,000 --> 01:55:20,000
hardly anyone can understand

2540
01:55:20,000 --> 01:55:22,000
what the heck I'm saying

2541
01:55:22,000 --> 01:55:24,000
so

2542
01:55:24,000 --> 01:55:26,000
do you mean

2543
01:55:26,000 --> 01:55:28,000
do

2544
01:55:28,000 --> 01:55:30,000
sorry do you mean just having a big white square

2545
01:55:30,000 --> 01:55:32,000
over the male's face with the nicotine patch

2546
01:55:32,000 --> 01:55:34,000
on the head maybe I understand

2547
01:55:34,000 --> 01:55:36,000
or I'm just stupid

2548
01:55:36,000 --> 01:55:38,000
oh no you're not stupid you silly goober

2549
01:55:38,000 --> 01:55:40,000
sorry for that idea

2550
01:55:40,000 --> 01:55:42,000
I had a character we need eyes and a mouth

2551
01:55:42,000 --> 01:55:44,000
um

2552
01:55:44,000 --> 01:55:46,000
if you go on my alternative twitter

2553
01:55:46,000 --> 01:55:48,000
um

2554
01:55:48,000 --> 01:55:50,000
that art

2555
01:55:50,000 --> 01:55:52,000
why am I

2556
01:55:52,000 --> 01:55:54,000
I was not asleep

2557
01:55:54,000 --> 01:55:56,000
papaparito

2558
01:55:56,000 --> 01:55:58,000
drew a wiggling head on a man

2559
01:55:58,000 --> 01:56:00,000
if you need a mouth and eyes

2560
01:56:00,000 --> 01:56:02,000
you can maybe do that

2561
01:56:02,000 --> 01:56:04,000
oh Jesus

2562
01:56:04,000 --> 01:56:06,000
I'm in danger gonna get double teamed up

2563
01:56:06,000 --> 01:56:08,000
by double AC

2564
01:56:08,000 --> 01:56:10,000
it's normal for Scottish

2565
01:56:10,000 --> 01:56:12,000
using so many hours then

2566
01:56:12,000 --> 01:56:14,000
so

2567
01:56:14,000 --> 01:56:16,000

2569
01:56:18,000 --> 01:56:20,000

01:56:20,000 --> 01:56:22,000
like good ghetto

2571
01:56:26,000 --> 01:56:28,000
your last ASMR stream

2572
01:56:28,000 --> 01:56:30,000
when you kissed on the head I felt it

2573
01:56:30,000 --> 01:56:32,000

01:56:40,000 --> 01:56:42,000
when your collab for double eastern european

2577
01:56:42,000 --> 01:56:44,000
would go hard

2578
01:56:44,000 --> 01:56:46,000
honestly yeah

2579
01:56:46,000 --> 01:56:48,000

and so long

2593
01:57:18,000 --> 01:57:20,000
reeflings can you see

2594
01:57:20,000 --> 01:57:22,000

yeah

2602
01:57:36,000 --> 01:57:38,000
I was curious about your preferences

2603
01:57:38,000 --> 01:57:40,000
and pep use

2604
01:57:40,000 --> 01:57:42,000
I had to thought about a video

2605
01:57:42,000 --> 01:57:44,000
but then I wasn't sure if the visuals

2606
01:57:44,000 --> 01:57:46,000
marriage is much as sound I would make

2607
01:57:46,000 --> 01:57:48,000
so I was wondering oh audio's work

2608
01:57:48,000 --> 01:57:50,000
