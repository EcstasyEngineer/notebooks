00:17.000 --> 00:25.000
my baby don't mess around because there's something else and then she told me so

00:25.000 --> 00:28.000
black cats and then and then

00:28.000 --> 00:33.000
but I know for sure

00:33.000 --> 00:38.000
oh oh sorry you just caught me

00:38.000 --> 00:43.000
warming up for my future karaoke stream

00:43.000 --> 00:46.000
oh no I'm so embarrassed

00:46.000 --> 00:49.000
I can't believe you caught me like that

00:49.000 --> 00:53.000
oh um good morning

00:53.000 --> 00:56.000
good evening and uh good afternoon

00:56.000 --> 00:58.000
who's that going? who's that going?

00:58.000 --> 01:03.000
on 4k bro

01:03.000 --> 01:06.000
as if I didn't orchestrate that bye bye

01:06.000 --> 01:10.000
okay she's in the ash kitchen voice again

01:10.000 --> 01:14.000
hiya America hiya

01:14.000 --> 01:17.000
good morning

01:17.000 --> 01:20.000
uh I haven't add in front of the stream

01:20.000 --> 01:27.000
no you shouldn't have I've told YouTube not to do this specifically

01:27.000 --> 01:30.000
that's not right hold on hold it

01:30.000 --> 01:34.000
fucking monetization

01:34.000 --> 01:38.000
choose when mid rolls appear insert them manually

01:38.000 --> 01:40.000
YouTube's taking the piss

01:40.000 --> 01:45.000
because I haven't put ads on I don't put ads on on live streams

01:45.000 --> 01:49.000
are they forcing ads on live streams there?

01:49.000 --> 01:52.000
they better not be I'm gonna fart

01:52.000 --> 01:54.000
I'm gonna do it okay

01:54.000 --> 01:56.000
I get ads on my phone

01:56.000 --> 02:00.000
um that'll be YouTube pocket in the full ad then

02:00.000 --> 02:02.000
what did I just walk into?

02:02.000 --> 02:04.000
I don't know

02:04.000 --> 02:08.000
please don't think about me like that

02:08.000 --> 02:10.000
okay got a bit of an update

02:10.000 --> 02:14.000
Mercy's emotes approved I'm just waiting for the delivery so they could be thingied

02:14.000 --> 02:17.000
there was two mistakes with Azur's emotes

02:17.000 --> 02:21.000
so I had to pay an extra couple of dollars do's

02:21.000 --> 02:24.000
but the sneaky little sneaker tins

02:24.000 --> 02:29.000
they extended the delivery time by three weeks to fix two emotes

02:29.000 --> 02:33.000
and they already have taken quite a while

02:33.000 --> 02:37.000
so I need to wait until Mercy and Azur's batch of 10 are done

02:37.000 --> 02:41.000
before I can order everyone else's missing slot emotes

02:41.000 --> 02:43.000
is that my sense?

02:43.000 --> 02:45.000
so I can't do anything yet

02:45.000 --> 02:47.000
my hands are tied

02:47.000 --> 02:49.000
my hands are tied okay

02:49.000 --> 02:51.000
but not to be confused my hand can't

02:51.000 --> 02:53.000
okay as for the updates again

02:53.000 --> 02:56.000
bleeding hearts, reflins, both the user in the same club

02:56.000 --> 02:58.000
I'll need to sleep after the stream

02:58.000 --> 03:01.000
and then I will get the third audio up

03:01.000 --> 03:05.000
my audio is beam of fur babacucation

03:05.000 --> 03:11.000
and Azur's is landlord lips never felt so okay

03:11.000 --> 03:14.000
who wrote that? it was me at the time

03:14.000 --> 03:17.000
it was absolutely outrageous behaviour

03:17.000 --> 03:21.000
honestly outrageous

03:21.000 --> 03:25.000
is that doom music playing in the background?

03:25.000 --> 03:27.000
but I hope not

03:27.000 --> 03:30.000
there shouldn't be any music playing in the background

03:30.000 --> 03:32.000
this is what plays in the background

03:32.000 --> 03:34.000
but it's a bit sad

03:34.000 --> 03:36.000
but anyway

03:36.000 --> 03:38.000
got an update

03:38.000 --> 03:40.000
me dad

03:40.000 --> 03:42.000
me dad's officially

03:42.000 --> 03:44.000
fucked off

03:44.000 --> 03:47.000
nah it's true, papacuttle's is heading home

03:47.000 --> 03:49.000
so

03:49.000 --> 03:51.000
now I do have two more streams of shorter games

03:51.000 --> 03:54.000
just so I can catch up on the ASMR I need to record

03:54.000 --> 03:59.000
because I need to record about 3 hours worth of shit I'm missing

03:59.000 --> 04:02.000
but the good news is

04:02.000 --> 04:05.000
it lets me catch up on all my work

04:05.000 --> 04:08.000
now I do have a message for your reflins

04:08.000 --> 04:10.000
but I can't read it yet or I'm gonna cry

04:10.000 --> 04:13.000
so I'll read it tomorrow

04:13.000 --> 04:15.000
I can't read it today

04:15.000 --> 04:17.000
or I'll greet my eyes out

04:17.000 --> 04:20.000
I miss pap already

04:20.000 --> 04:22.000
aww I miss him too I was so sad

04:22.000 --> 04:24.000
both of us were like

04:24.000 --> 04:27.000
I was like I didn't want to cry in front of him

04:27.000 --> 04:29.000
as he was going

04:29.000 --> 04:31.000
so I was like

04:31.000 --> 04:33.000
so there's this fucking meme for this stupid thing

04:33.000 --> 04:35.000
I don't know what it is

04:35.000 --> 04:37.000
but the meme goes

04:37.000 --> 04:39.000
be strong, Clarence be strong for mama

04:39.000 --> 04:42.000
and that's what goes in my head

04:42.000 --> 04:44.000
when I try and tell myself not to laugh

04:44.000 --> 04:46.000
not to cry sorry

04:46.000 --> 04:48.000
like to try and cheer me up

04:48.000 --> 04:50.000
I can't remember what the meme is

04:50.000 --> 04:52.000
but it's like be strong, Clarence be strong for mama

04:54.000 --> 04:56.000
so he didn't see me cry

04:56.000 --> 04:58.000
but as soon as like

04:58.000 --> 05:00.000
I couldn't see him anymore

05:00.000 --> 05:02.000
oh god I'm getting emotional

05:02.000 --> 05:05.000
ok we're playing a little to the left today

05:05.000 --> 05:07.000
which is a puzzle game ok

05:07.000 --> 05:09.000
now as well no puzzle game

05:09.000 --> 05:11.000
so it's my biggest enemy

05:11.000 --> 05:13.000
because it requires IQ

05:13.000 --> 05:15.000
that I do not possess

05:15.000 --> 05:17.000
in any way shape or form

05:17.000 --> 05:19.000
thank you GothMommyBee

05:19.000 --> 05:21.000
for becoming a member

05:21.000 --> 05:23.000
enjoy those emotions

05:23.000 --> 05:25.000
I have four more on the way

05:25.000 --> 05:27.000
I think there's four more slots

05:29.000 --> 05:31.000
bye strong

05:31.000 --> 05:33.000
be strong for the refling

05:33.000 --> 05:35.000
it's a TISM game

05:35.000 --> 05:37.000
oh god

05:37.000 --> 05:39.000
isn't that a dodo meme

05:39.000 --> 05:41.000
it's a pokemon meme

05:41.000 --> 05:43.000
it's like a mash of a dodo

05:43.000 --> 05:45.000
one of the dodo birds

05:45.000 --> 05:47.000
it's wrong

05:47.000 --> 05:49.000
yes oh my god you know it

05:49.000 --> 05:51.000
now you got high IQ I can tell

05:51.000 --> 05:53.000
yeah

05:59.000 --> 06:01.000
hello

06:01.000 --> 06:03.000

what the fuck

06:21.000 --> 06:23.000
my OBS was like red

06:23.000 --> 06:25.000
red panic

06:25.000 --> 06:27.000
red alert red alert set phasers

06:27.000 --> 06:29.000
to eliminate

06:29.000 --> 06:31.000

06:31.000 --> 06:33.000
what was that

06:33.000 --> 06:35.000

06:39.000 --> 06:41.000
where I was like hey this is how much

06:41.000 --> 06:43.000
vtubers actually make

06:43.000 --> 06:45.000
and I'm not just gonna dance around the question

06:49.000 --> 06:51.000
I need to do the

06:51.000 --> 06:53.000
I need to do the repromotional bit here

06:55.000 --> 06:57.000
the red spies in the base legit honestly

06:59.000 --> 07:01.000
best short yet

07:01.000 --> 07:03.000
I got a short and then I asked the question

07:03.000 --> 07:05.000
and I actually answered the question

07:05.000 --> 07:07.000
in the short

07:07.000 --> 07:09.000
oh my god

07:09.000 --> 07:11.000
VTuber challenge complete

07:11.000 --> 07:13.000
asked the question and actually

07:13.000 --> 07:15.000
answered it in a short

07:15.000 --> 07:17.000
oh let's go man

07:21.000 --> 07:23.000
the numbers were

07:23.000 --> 07:25.000
very impressive

07:25.000 --> 07:27.000
right so some of you might not know this

07:27.000 --> 07:29.000
I got a thousand dollar donation

07:29.000 --> 07:31.000
completely anonymous

07:31.000 --> 07:33.000
near request not an else attached

07:33.000 --> 07:35.000
couldn't give life of a shit

07:35.000 --> 07:37.000
just gives me a thousand dollars and pisses off like oh

07:39.000 --> 07:41.000
so that's the truth but yeah

07:41.000 --> 07:43.000
that's great short but the IRS jump

07:43.000 --> 07:45.000
skewer is not appreciate

07:45.000 --> 07:47.000
bro if you need to hold 30% back or the IRS

07:47.000 --> 07:49.000
is literally ready to like

07:49.000 --> 07:51.000
I'm gonna dick you

07:51.000 --> 07:53.000
down like that

07:53.000 --> 07:55.000
there you go

07:57.000 --> 07:59.000
and it's for sure not sabotage

07:59.000 --> 08:01.000
maybe from this one someone was like

08:01.000 --> 08:03.000
remember that time you were worried about funding

08:03.000 --> 08:05.000
gen 2 and I'm like

08:05.000 --> 08:07.000
honestly

08:07.000 --> 08:09.000
just off it you're making me blush

08:09.000 --> 08:11.000
like real real

08:11.000 --> 08:13.000
actually real okay let me just

08:13.000 --> 08:15.000
slurp my tea

08:15.000 --> 08:17.000
also nice to meet everyone

08:17.000 --> 08:19.000
hi

08:19.000 --> 08:21.000
thanks for joining for that first time

08:21.000 --> 08:23.000
I'm strong enough

08:23.000 --> 08:25.000
unfortunately I'm Scottish but

08:25.000 --> 08:27.000
the good thing is it gives me frost resistance

08:27.000 --> 08:29.000
so it's not bad

08:29.000 --> 08:31.000
if you would like

08:31.000 --> 08:33.000
to consider yourself

08:33.000 --> 08:35.000
an enjoyer of me

08:35.000 --> 08:37.000
you can refer to yourself

08:37.000 --> 08:39.000
as a replay

08:39.000 --> 08:41.000
or replay

08:41.000 --> 08:43.000
when you came and you gave me a

08:43.000 --> 08:45.000
kiss

08:45.000 --> 08:47.000
I reached a round

08:47.000 --> 08:49.000
and

08:49.000 --> 08:51.000
you got a thousand dollar dono

08:51.000 --> 08:53.000
what about Emmy's 400 dono

08:53.000 --> 08:55.000
it's getting clipped and shipped

08:55.000 --> 08:57.000
it's already been sent for editing purposes

08:57.000 --> 08:59.000
so

08:59.000 --> 09:01.000
identify as an ord

09:01.000 --> 09:03.000
I am translucent with how pale I am

09:03.000 --> 09:05.000
you can see my entire vascular

09:05.000 --> 09:07.000
system at a glance

09:07.000 --> 09:09.000
that's how pale I am

09:09.000 --> 09:11.000
I literally have hues

09:11.000 --> 09:13.000
of purple and blue thanks to

09:13.000 --> 09:15.000
my veins that I am that pale

09:15.000 --> 09:17.000
so I would consider myself a

09:17.000 --> 09:19.000
Nord and the name of the Nord

09:19.000 --> 09:21.000
I pray to the Lord you all get a taste

09:21.000 --> 09:23.000
of my blade and my sword I'm taking on

09:23.000 --> 09:25.000
what's that Emmy's

09:27.000 --> 09:29.000
purple yes if you

09:29.000 --> 09:31.000
have very translucent skin

09:31.000 --> 09:33.000
veins can appear purple and I have

09:33.000 --> 09:35.000
very almost purple esk under

09:35.000 --> 09:37.000
my eyeballs and relay which means I'm

09:37.000 --> 09:39.000
perfect for being a girl

09:39.000 --> 09:41.000
oh my god that was a voice crack

09:41.000 --> 09:43.000
voice crack

09:45.000 --> 09:47.000
also we saw the ring fit stream

09:47.000 --> 09:49.000
I assume you haven't seen sunlight in years how

09:49.000 --> 09:51.000
dare you

09:51.000 --> 09:53.000
he spoke nothing but the truth I'm

09:53.000 --> 09:55.000
insulted by such words

09:55.000 --> 09:57.000
and yet no true words were spoken in that

09:57.000 --> 09:59.000
moment my goodness

09:59.000 --> 10:01.000
you could probably put it to scripture that's

10:01.000 --> 10:03.000
so truthful he was being in that moment

10:03.000 --> 10:05.000
aww absolutely annihilated

10:05.000 --> 10:07.000
honestly sun gets reflect

10:07.000 --> 10:09.000
I can't go outside without fully closed

10:09.000 --> 10:11.000
it'll be like

10:11.000 --> 10:13.000
well it's winter right now so it doesn't

10:13.000 --> 10:15.000
wait what's next

10:15.000 --> 10:17.000
my wires

10:17.000 --> 10:19.000
sorry if I seem like

10:19.000 --> 10:21.000
fucking hyper I'm like

10:21.000 --> 10:23.000
super sad inside but I'm really glad I get to

10:23.000 --> 10:25.000
talk to you Evelyn I'd be a puddle

10:25.000 --> 10:27.000
right now and I just

10:27.000 --> 10:29.000
thought this game was gonna go shite because

10:29.000 --> 10:31.000
it's a fucking puzzle game

10:31.000 --> 10:33.000
it requires IQ

10:33.000 --> 10:35.000
the beacons are lit have you slept

10:35.000 --> 10:37.000
so I

10:37.000 --> 10:39.000
stayed up last night

10:39.000 --> 10:41.000
writing scripts for the girls

10:41.000 --> 10:43.000
so

10:43.000 --> 10:45.000
AC has a script

10:45.000 --> 10:47.000
about scratching your back

10:47.000 --> 10:49.000
because obviously she's a polar bear and she's got

10:49.000 --> 10:51.000
claws right so

10:51.000 --> 10:53.000
I

10:53.000 --> 10:55.000
wrote a script about AC that she gives you like back

10:55.000 --> 10:57.000
scratches in the middle of the night and she has

10:57.000 --> 10:59.000
her sleepy voice on okay

10:59.000 --> 11:01.000
and then I wrote one for

11:01.000 --> 11:03.000
Mercy where it's Yandere

11:03.000 --> 11:05.000
it gives you a haircut while she's tied you up

11:05.000 --> 11:07.000
in your bed ASMR

11:07.000 --> 11:09.000
it's the most bizarre thing I've ever written in my life

11:09.000 --> 11:11.000
are you squiddin me right now

11:11.000 --> 11:13.000
I'm fucking giggling away at myself over it

11:13.000 --> 11:15.000
and then Azura's is a

11:15.000 --> 11:17.000
dummy mummy

11:17.000 --> 11:19.000
praises you in your sleep

11:19.000 --> 11:21.000
ASMR I've not finished Azura's

11:21.000 --> 11:23.000
but I'm about to

11:23.000 --> 11:25.000
but I sent it to Mercy and Mercy's like oh

11:25.000 --> 11:27.000
I actually wrote some stuff for myself

11:27.000 --> 11:29.000
and then Azura was like oh I actually

11:29.000 --> 11:31.000
got some stuff to do YouTube ASMR

11:31.000 --> 11:33.000
with and I'm like

11:33.000 --> 11:35.000
my daughters don't even need me

11:35.000 --> 11:37.000
I'm being outsourced already

11:39.000 --> 11:41.000
Tim Schottel thank you for the tip

11:41.000 --> 11:43.000
love the new short your open book

11:43.000 --> 11:45.000
just as open as my legs baby

11:47.000 --> 11:49.000
well I tried

11:49.000 --> 11:51.000
and it's very interesting to see the things

11:51.000 --> 11:53.000
that people don't share you are amazing

11:53.000 --> 11:55.000
thank you I appreciate it

11:55.000 --> 11:57.000
yeah I

11:57.000 --> 11:59.000
personally I have

11:59.000 --> 12:01.000
problems being like this is what it looks like

12:01.000 --> 12:03.000
behind the scenes because I think a lot of people

12:03.000 --> 12:05.000
don't get the opportunity to really see

12:05.000 --> 12:07.000
that which is why I want to be like

12:07.000 --> 12:09.000
hey we might be a small

12:09.000 --> 12:11.000
agency but I did put a bit

12:11.000 --> 12:13.000
of thought behind you know

12:13.000 --> 12:15.000
gets an exchange of services and

12:15.000 --> 12:17.000
trying to earn my money you know

12:17.000 --> 12:19.000
I might be shocking

12:19.000 --> 12:21.000
but mummy

12:21.000 --> 12:23.000
what is bigger your first month's paycheck

12:23.000 --> 12:25.000
for beach ever are you

12:25.000 --> 12:27.000
long what

12:27.000 --> 12:29.000
I don't

12:29.000 --> 12:31.000
I mean I'm technically

12:31.000 --> 12:33.000
five inches

12:35.000 --> 12:37.000
what is that

12:37.000 --> 12:39.000
they're all grown up outsourced in the first

12:39.000 --> 12:41.000
month honestly

12:43.000 --> 12:45.000
I've got a collab with AC and Emmy

12:45.000 --> 12:47.000
to write but so there's one

12:47.000 --> 12:49.000
on Emmy's channel of her and AC

12:49.000 --> 12:51.000
but I need to do it the other way

12:51.000 --> 12:53.000
around and I think I want to do it

12:53.000 --> 12:55.000
like Bratz give you a haircut

12:55.000 --> 12:57.000
because I need to record new haircut sounds

12:59.000 --> 13:01.000
well piss

13:01.000 --> 13:03.000
what I'm so sorry that was my accent

13:03.000 --> 13:05.000
let me try that again

13:11.000 --> 13:13.000
thank you for becoming a member I'm so sorry

13:13.000 --> 13:15.000
I said piss in your name there's not it's just

13:15.000 --> 13:17.000
I just can't read properly

13:17.000 --> 13:19.000
I'm so sorry I think I might do like

13:19.000 --> 13:21.000
two Bratz cut your hair in the middle of the

13:21.000 --> 13:23.000
night for Emmy and AC and they're whispering

13:23.000 --> 13:25.000
to themselves about how mischievous

13:25.000 --> 13:27.000
they both are and then you just get like

13:27.000 --> 13:29.000
back like over the cheek

13:29.000 --> 13:31.000
and then like kind of like the midnight

13:31.000 --> 13:33.000
barber mean for the mighty bush if you've

13:33.000 --> 13:35.000
ever seen that it's about a British

13:35.000 --> 13:37.000
comedy yeah

13:37.000 --> 13:39.000
but it's got to be

13:39.000 --> 13:41.000
those units don't compare

13:41.000 --> 13:43.000
you know what compares

13:43.000 --> 13:45.000
me and you

13:45.000 --> 13:47.000
I'm sorry

13:47.000 --> 13:49.000
we missed up we gotta go but oh that's how I

13:49.000 --> 13:51.000
should end it oh shit we missed up

13:51.000 --> 13:53.000
we gotta go

13:53.000 --> 13:55.000
I think strongy call me

13:55.000 --> 13:57.000
I know it's okay it's a hard name

13:57.000 --> 13:59.000
just say I just don't make it easy

13:59.000 --> 14:01.000
oh my god can't believe you're not making it

14:01.000 --> 14:03.000
easy for me

14:03.000 --> 14:05.000
this is

14:05.000 --> 14:07.000
this is my time joining a violer stream and I know this

14:07.000 --> 14:09.000

14:09.000 --> 14:11.000
very adult by adult I mean jerking my

14:11.000 --> 14:13.000
pintas but I'm curious on whether or not

14:13.000 --> 14:15.000
it's a nice and welcoming community as well

14:15.000 --> 14:17.000
as the others yes it's

14:17.000 --> 14:19.000
a misconception that we are literally

14:19.000 --> 14:21.000
humping the screen 24-7 on youtube

14:21.000 --> 14:23.000
nope that's that's not what we are

14:23.000 --> 14:25.000

14:25.000 --> 14:27.000
a bit of a misconception anyway

15:45.000 --> 15:47.000

15:49.000 --> 15:51.000
hmm

15:51.000 --> 15:53.000
I like this funny creature

15:53.000 --> 15:55.000
this creature amuses me

15:57.000 --> 15:59.000
you mean fortunately you're Scottish

15:59.000 --> 16:01.000
I SHITE ME IN SCHOOL

16:01.000 --> 16:03.000
yeah yes uh membership streams

16:03.000 --> 16:05.000
also start up

16:05.000 --> 16:07.000
not gonna lie

16:07.000 --> 16:09.000
being addicted to league is a huge deal

16:09.000 --> 16:11.000
like everyone needs a weakness

16:11.000 --> 16:13.000
my weakness is like I'm literally

16:13.000 --> 16:15.000
I'm not allowed to say that cause it will

16:15.000 --> 16:17.000
worry you guys

16:17.000 --> 16:19.000
I'm not allowed to say that

16:19.000 --> 16:21.000
being British is your weakness

16:21.000 --> 16:23.000
no that's probably what it is

16:23.000 --> 16:25.000
I get considered British cause technically

16:25.000 --> 16:27.000
you know United Kingdom, Scotland

16:27.000 --> 16:29.000
however

16:29.000 --> 16:31.000
however

16:31.000 --> 16:33.000
yes

16:33.000 --> 16:35.000
I'm not gonna lie

16:35.000 --> 16:37.000
first agency I liked all the members

16:37.000 --> 16:39.000
and I actually sit through the streams

16:39.000 --> 16:41.000
so

16:41.000 --> 16:43.000
obviously

16:43.000 --> 16:45.000
the girls are free to discuss their PL

16:45.000 --> 16:47.000
stuff but I've kinda said this

16:47.000 --> 16:49.000
like everyone got picked cause I saw a bit

16:49.000 --> 16:51.000
of myself in them

16:51.000 --> 16:53.000
and I have a bias for the underdog

16:53.000 --> 16:55.000
I don't give a shit

16:55.000 --> 16:57.000
if you think that's a bad whatever

16:57.000 --> 16:59.000
I like the underdog

16:59.000 --> 17:01.000
obviously the only exception is kinda

17:01.000 --> 17:03.000
me the Emmy if you want to get

17:03.000 --> 17:05.000
takey spaky

17:05.000 --> 17:07.000
but Emmy

17:07.000 --> 17:09.000
Emmy

17:09.000 --> 17:11.000
was I've said this before

17:11.000 --> 17:13.000
Emmy was quite inquisitive during the interview stage

17:13.000 --> 17:15.000
and she was like

17:15.000 --> 17:17.000
asking how it would work behind the scenes

17:17.000 --> 17:19.000
and she was very keen to start on something new

17:19.000 --> 17:21.000
and I can completely

17:21.000 --> 17:23.000
relate on a personal level

17:23.000 --> 17:25.000
of being like I don't wanna do this shit

17:25.000 --> 17:27.000
no more on my own like fuck it let's

17:27.000 --> 17:29.000
let's do it

17:29.000 --> 17:31.000
so yeah

17:31.000 --> 17:33.000
this is definitely a yapping corporal on that

17:33.000 --> 17:35.000
right and he gets started with the game

17:35.000 --> 17:37.000
I have no idea how long this game takes

17:37.000 --> 17:39.000
I am going to aim for like a two hour stream

17:39.000 --> 17:41.000
and then I'll read

17:41.000 --> 17:43.000
oh she be

17:43.000 --> 17:45.000
okay I can't read it right

17:45.000 --> 17:47.000
into she be

17:47.000 --> 17:49.000
here I will admit I do miss the bunny

17:49.000 --> 17:51.000
the bunny's coming home

17:53.000 --> 17:55.000
she's coming to my house

17:55.000 --> 17:57.000
and I'm coming all I'm sorry I'm not

17:57.000 --> 17:59.000
oh we burp I'm so sorry

17:59.000 --> 18:01.000
to that person that's new

18:01.000 --> 18:03.000
we burp a lot all of us pretty much burp a lot

18:03.000 --> 18:05.000
uh Azura should have

18:05.000 --> 18:07.000
a new short up about burping if I'm not mistaken

18:07.000 --> 18:09.000
hold on Azura Duley

18:09.000 --> 18:11.000
I spent a ridiculous amount of money on the shorts

18:11.000 --> 18:13.000
oh there it is

18:13.000 --> 18:15.000
oh no it's Azura's milk shop

18:15.000 --> 18:17.000
wait hold on let me

18:17.000 --> 18:19.000
Azura got four shorts

18:19.000 --> 18:21.000
and they finally came

18:21.000 --> 18:23.000
they came we sent them

18:23.000 --> 18:25.000
to an editor right

18:25.000 --> 18:27.000
and then the editor went AFK for two weeks

18:27.000 --> 18:29.000
so we had to send it to a new editor

18:29.000 --> 18:31.000
and the new editor was like give us five days

18:31.000 --> 18:33.000
and I'm like

18:33.000 --> 18:35.000
Azura has literally no shorts please

18:35.000 --> 18:37.000
please I'm begging that's

18:37.000 --> 18:39.000
Azura's one and then she be

18:39.000 --> 18:41.000
I think oh no she be's aren't out yet

18:41.000 --> 18:43.000

18:43.000 --> 18:45.000
but yeah

18:47.000 --> 18:49.000
Azura is so strong even in the shorts

18:49.000 --> 18:51.000
think your dad went home too

18:51.000 --> 18:53.000
and if so he made it home okay

18:53.000 --> 18:55.000
and he's nice and safe

18:55.000 --> 18:57.000

28:15.000 --> 28:17.000
three plus twelve

28:17.000 --> 28:19.000
wait no what's the difference between

28:19.000 --> 28:21.000
three and twelve nine

28:21.000 --> 28:23.000
one two three

28:23.000 --> 28:25.000
four five six seven eight nine

28:27.000 --> 28:29.000
one two

28:29.000 --> 28:31.000

28:43.000 --> 28:45.000
oh no there's tons

28:45.000 --> 28:47.000
how am I supposed to do this via logic

28:49.000 --> 28:51.000
right the difference between one and ten

28:51.000 --> 28:53.000
is nine so

28:53.000 --> 28:55.000
nineteen

28:55.000 --> 28:57.000
and then nineteen plus nine is

28:57.000 --> 28:59.000
twenty eight

28:59.000 --> 29:01.000
one two three four five six seven eight nine

29:01.000 --> 29:03.000
okay and then

29:03.000 --> 29:05.000
the red one is first

29:05.000 --> 29:07.000
and the blue one is nice

29:07.000 --> 29:09.000
the flower thirteen

29:09.000 --> 29:11.000
take away four is

29:11.000 --> 29:13.000
nine again

29:13.000 --> 29:15.000
uh nine and thirteen

29:15.000 --> 29:17.000
together make

29:17.000 --> 29:19.000
twenty two

29:19.000 --> 29:21.000
okay

29:21.000 --> 29:23.000
and then

29:23.000 --> 29:25.000
five comes after the

29:25.000 --> 29:27.000
flower

29:27.000 --> 29:29.000
okay okay don't hurt him now

29:29.000 --> 29:31.000
and then after the flower is the yellow

29:31.000 --> 29:33.000
don't hurt him now

29:33.000 --> 29:35.000
don't hurt him with that logic now

29:35.000 --> 29:37.000
don't don't hurt him now right and then

29:37.000 --> 29:39.000
a gap between the yellow

29:39.000 --> 29:41.000
and then it's the petal

29:41.000 --> 29:43.000
gap between the yellow

29:43.000 --> 29:45.000
oh my god I love that

29:45.000 --> 29:47.000
I loved everything about that please more

29:49.000 --> 29:51.000
oh my god

29:51.000 --> 29:53.000
there's a fake sign to start a sign when doing it

29:53.000 --> 29:55.000
correctly

29:55.000 --> 29:57.000
is this hate

29:57.000 --> 29:59.000
or am I making a picture

30:01.000 --> 30:03.000
it kinda looks like hate

30:03.000 --> 30:05.000
uh

30:09.000 --> 30:11.000
uh huh oh yeah

30:11.000 --> 30:13.000

30:19.000 --> 30:21.000
uh huh uh huh

yeah

30:23.000 --> 30:25.000
yep yep yep yep

30:25.000 --> 30:27.000
okay that's not the answer

30:27.000 --> 30:29.000
but that's okay

30:29.000 --> 30:31.000
what happens if we did it

30:31.000 --> 30:33.000
if we put

30:33.000 --> 30:35.000
even Steven on the outside

30:35.000 --> 30:37.000
going in

30:37.000 --> 30:39.000
because then that middle book isn't odd

30:39.000 --> 30:41.000
because it'll go in the middle because there's only one of it

30:43.000 --> 30:45.000
oh

30:45.000 --> 30:47.000
oh this is actually not a bad game

I couldn't verbalize anything

49:15.000 --> 49:17.000
I was doing it right there

because that's how I think

49:33.000 --> 49:35.000
I can't verbalize it or it's not gonna work

49:37.000 --> 49:39.000

50:31.000 --> 50:33.000
Gimli's got a bit of ginger on her

50:33.000 --> 50:35.000

50:35.000 --> 50:37.000
and then when I pick, well

50:37.000 --> 50:39.000
I've actually started to pick her up a little bit

50:39.000 --> 50:41.000
which is something too bad

50:41.000 --> 50:43.000
and I couldn't go that's my weird loud Gimli

59:51.240 --> 59:53.240
I don't I don't know you

59:53.240 --> 59:55.400
I don't know you want you want to be honest

59:58.200 --> 01:00:00.200
What do you want?

01:00:00.760 --> 01:00:04.040
Just move it a little to the left. You know what?

01:00:04.920 --> 01:00:11.240
You know what? You know what? You're the first to get our word in the train. Sorry. I really shouldn't make

01:00:12.280 --> 01:00:16.040
And yet I do what happens. What happens? I don't know

01:00:17.800 --> 01:00:21.160
What are you? What are you saying?

01:00:21.880 --> 01:00:23.880
Right, hold on. Let's go

01:00:24.120 --> 01:00:25.640
Let's do wit

01:00:25.640 --> 01:00:27.640
Again, the milk is the wittiest boy

01:00:28.280 --> 01:00:30.840
Right, you're skinny melinky long legs. So don't

01:00:31.640 --> 01:00:33.640
Right, let's do witt

01:00:50.120 --> 01:00:52.120
Um

01:00:58.040 --> 01:01:05.240
I'm stumped. I don't know what it is. Uh, something about the colors

01:01:06.040 --> 01:01:08.040
Okay, let's okay

01:01:08.600 --> 01:01:10.600
Something about the colors

01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:18.760
Colors, uh, love them. I'm not colorblind. Lucky me. Uh, yellow

01:01:19.640 --> 01:01:21.640
Oh

01:01:24.520 --> 01:01:28.440
Something about the colors

01:01:38.120 --> 01:01:40.120
Um

01:01:40.120 --> 01:01:42.120
Oh

01:01:47.720 --> 01:01:52.760
What what are you asking for

01:01:56.040 --> 01:01:58.760
I've no go clue colors

01:02:00.200 --> 01:02:08.120
You know last time magic segregation was like way back in the fucking past. What the fuck are we doing sort by colors for?

01:02:10.120 --> 01:02:12.120
What the fuck? I can't figure it out

01:02:15.800 --> 01:02:22.920
Purple right, there's purple here a purple there. Then that's the balsamic fucking piece of shit

01:02:24.200 --> 01:02:26.200
Right, so now what?

01:02:28.120 --> 01:02:30.120
Align the labels

01:02:31.640 --> 01:02:33.640
What they're supposed to fucking kiss

01:02:34.760 --> 01:02:36.760
Where how is that supposed to

01:02:40.440 --> 01:02:42.440
I

01:02:47.880 --> 01:02:54.360
What what even is this laying the labels on my back

01:02:56.760 --> 01:02:59.160
What it's all supposed to like touch or something

01:03:01.400 --> 01:03:04.280
Olive oil next to the milk

01:03:10.360 --> 01:03:12.360
So

01:03:26.440 --> 01:03:29.800
Whatever vv said about this game she was right

01:03:32.120 --> 01:03:34.120
What

01:03:35.320 --> 01:03:37.560
I can see something forming here

01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:43.400
I don't think we should all the luck

01:04:01.160 --> 01:04:07.000
I don't even have a brain cell to talk and try and figure this out at the same time. Are we skipped you doodling?

01:04:07.080 --> 01:04:12.680
I think you're overthinking it. Well, how do I open up the menu?

01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:29.640
Tubbs and mayonnaise to milk to balsamic

01:04:33.560 --> 01:04:35.960
There's a fucking line there's a hidden line

01:04:37.960 --> 01:04:40.200
Right tub to mayonnaise to milk

01:04:42.600 --> 01:04:44.600
Tub

01:04:45.400 --> 01:04:50.840
To mayonnaise to milk something I already forgot

01:04:58.280 --> 01:05:00.280
Ah

01:05:01.240 --> 01:05:08.280
It's milk to balsamic to thingy to the medium the milk to the stomach

01:05:16.280 --> 01:05:18.280
I still not afraid again

01:05:18.280 --> 01:05:20.280
So

01:05:35.960 --> 01:05:37.960
Space them

01:05:48.280 --> 01:05:50.280
Oh

01:06:04.920 --> 01:06:06.920
Yeah, that's getting a bit too much

01:06:07.400 --> 01:06:12.440
That's getting a bit too much hold on a minute. VV was right. Hashtag VV was right. I'm not even being funny

01:06:13.080 --> 01:06:15.080
Oh

01:06:15.800 --> 01:06:17.800
Are you trying to soften me up after that one?

01:06:19.240 --> 01:06:21.240
pooders

01:06:31.160 --> 01:06:37.160
Any cheesers it's been funny, but I've got a shower. Oh, yeah, the puzzle really got you good

01:06:40.440 --> 01:06:43.080
Oh, okay, right I can tell the story um

01:06:45.640 --> 01:06:54.840
Okay, he has an idea. He wants to spill the drink. Okay. He drops the bath and the drink and plant

01:06:56.520 --> 01:07:01.160
Wait, we're just taking photos of our cat destroying stuff. We're like we're just letting it happen. Um

01:07:06.520 --> 01:07:10.840
Oh, no, it's going downhill. I thought I was doing so well, but my logic isn't

01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:12.120
Uh

01:07:12.120 --> 01:07:16.600
The reason the earth is not flat is this cat so didn't knock everything off switch the first

01:07:17.640 --> 01:07:19.640
switch the first

01:07:19.640 --> 01:07:21.640
second

01:07:22.600 --> 01:07:24.600
And throw the round

01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:33.500
You guys watch me do it the wrong way

01:07:41.800 --> 01:07:43.800
I

01:07:45.480 --> 01:07:48.040
Wait if I don't every combination but the correct one

01:07:50.360 --> 01:07:53.880
You guys have to look at the drink first and then he gets an idea to knock things over

01:07:54.600 --> 01:07:58.680
Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. He looks at the drink and then he gets a bright idea to knock shit over

01:08:00.360 --> 01:08:02.360
And then he knocks stuff over

01:08:03.160 --> 01:08:05.560
First he sees the glass and then the lamp

01:08:06.520 --> 01:08:10.840
Okay, he sees it and then he gets a bright idea to start knocking stuff over

01:08:12.040 --> 01:08:14.040
Okay, maybe another color puzzle

01:08:17.560 --> 01:08:20.120
Nettie gray, how many chapters are there?

01:08:21.320 --> 01:08:26.840
We're actually kind of get I mean we may actually do this. Hold on a minute. I have a little bit fee

01:08:36.520 --> 01:08:39.480
I spoke far too soon and I'm sorry

01:08:42.120 --> 01:08:44.120
Oh, I see something

01:08:45.960 --> 01:08:50.280
Okay, I see something I see something I see something here

01:08:50.280 --> 01:08:52.280
And this

01:09:01.800 --> 01:09:05.320
There's five chapters I have a little bit of faith sees the next puzzle

01:09:07.400 --> 01:09:09.400
Right these two fit

01:09:10.520 --> 01:09:14.920
Okay, these three fit and the glove fits the fingerprints on that one. So

01:09:16.760 --> 01:09:18.760
Okay, okay, okay

01:09:18.840 --> 01:09:21.480
Okay, it doesn't work. Oh wait, those two work together

01:09:36.600 --> 01:09:39.160
The bucket seems like it has to go there

01:09:42.920 --> 01:09:44.920
Yeah

01:09:49.640 --> 01:09:53.240
No, you can but you bump into him

01:09:57.320 --> 01:10:01.400
All right, everything bumps into the bucket so the bucket has to go at the end

01:10:03.160 --> 01:10:10.360
That is my only logical conclusion the bucket has to go there. Okay, right then we'll figure out what happens over here

01:10:19.640 --> 01:10:21.640
Oh

01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:25.000
Wait, what does it look right?

01:10:26.440 --> 01:10:30.840
Everything looks correct other than this one go in the bucket go in the bucket

01:10:32.760 --> 01:10:34.760
Go in the bucket

01:10:37.320 --> 01:10:39.480
I'm cleaning them make them shine

01:10:43.720 --> 01:10:46.680
This looks correct I gone crazy

01:10:49.560 --> 01:10:52.520
This oh the sponge goes in the square space

01:10:59.560 --> 01:11:04.360
Sponges, why are we no longer participating in the laws of physics all of a sudden

01:11:05.240 --> 01:11:10.120
Why is physics just optional now in the game right? I'll need to keep that in mind

01:11:11.080 --> 01:11:13.080
I

01:11:15.080 --> 01:11:19.640
Physics is no optional got a G's right big batteries

01:11:22.680 --> 01:11:24.680
I am speed

01:11:26.040 --> 01:11:28.040
I am speed

01:11:28.120 --> 01:11:30.120
I am speed

01:11:30.680 --> 01:11:32.680
I am speed

01:11:35.880 --> 01:11:37.880
You don't belong here

01:11:41.080 --> 01:11:48.040
You might belong here though. Yeah, that looks correct correct in Mundo

01:11:50.200 --> 01:11:52.600
Nope, you can't all fit in there you're too big

01:11:55.320 --> 01:11:57.320
Okay, okay, okay

01:12:02.040 --> 01:12:04.040
That looks

01:12:10.520 --> 01:12:14.600
I mean them I'm gonna see

01:12:28.600 --> 01:12:31.160
The yellow one on the place of the one

01:12:35.720 --> 01:12:38.220
Thank you for rather violent

01:12:40.440 --> 01:12:42.440
All you want to then

01:12:56.840 --> 01:13:01.560
Okay, this one's cute I like it I like it I dig it I dig it angry sneeze

01:13:02.920 --> 01:13:07.000
It was so loud my screen flickered. That's hilarious

01:13:11.080 --> 01:13:13.480
What's wrong? Oh, that's right

01:13:16.040 --> 01:13:18.040
That is different therefore it's wrong

01:13:18.680 --> 01:13:23.400
Okay, there we go. Oh, it's a good one. Okay. I like that one. I like that one. Let him get up

01:13:23.560 --> 01:13:28.680
Okay, the game might have redeemed itself slightly scream again, please. That was a sneeze

01:13:30.440 --> 01:13:33.400
You've got coins. So this is a 50-pence coin

01:13:40.120 --> 01:13:42.120
Okay

01:13:50.200 --> 01:13:52.840
Go from a circle

01:13:55.320 --> 01:13:57.880
Into a lesser circle over time

01:14:10.360 --> 01:14:15.880
A circle how many sides one two three four five six

01:14:16.760 --> 01:14:20.600
Seven eight nine ten one two three four. Oh you

01:14:22.440 --> 01:14:25.880
Wait one two three four five six seven

01:14:28.760 --> 01:14:35.080
One two three four five six one two three four five six nine

01:14:35.080 --> 01:14:37.080
Ten

01:14:53.640 --> 01:15:00.440
I'm sorry. I'm special needs. Hold on a minute. What I know what I'm trying to do but it's not coming out

01:15:00.840 --> 01:15:02.840
So

01:15:03.160 --> 01:15:06.520
Well, I just did more circling. Oh, they start

01:15:11.320 --> 01:15:13.320
Why would you start

01:15:16.200 --> 01:15:18.200
Why would you start

01:15:19.320 --> 01:15:21.320
Why did you start

01:15:22.120 --> 01:15:24.120
I

01:15:28.600 --> 01:15:30.600
Mean

01:15:30.840 --> 01:15:35.480
I'll take it. She's what that was an accidental discovery

01:15:37.320 --> 01:15:39.320
Let's try that that was the

01:15:44.120 --> 01:15:47.000
Maybe it's better to do the more obtuse items first

01:15:47.400 --> 01:15:50.760
Is that even fit

01:15:53.320 --> 01:15:55.320
That's what she said

01:15:56.760 --> 01:15:59.800
Get it get it because

01:16:02.040 --> 01:16:05.000
No, do the more obscure items you look obscure

01:16:06.360 --> 01:16:10.200
Anything that looks mainly different than the usual getting out

01:16:13.640 --> 01:16:16.040
What even is oh it's a tea infuser

01:16:17.720 --> 01:16:21.240
You put your dry tea in it one chopstick

01:16:25.880 --> 01:16:30.200
Sorry, there's a really good vein and the guy's like I'll have one

01:16:31.880 --> 01:16:33.880
Of your ass or

01:16:37.320 --> 01:16:39.320
No, no, no, no, no, you're not left to be

01:16:40.760 --> 01:16:45.320
Being out here. What? Oh, it's one of those that makes sense

01:16:47.960 --> 01:16:51.880
My god, I you knew it. Oh, you know it. You know it

01:16:53.640 --> 01:16:55.640
Uh

01:16:56.280 --> 01:16:59.640
Wait, is there only like one no, I can't hear it

01:17:04.360 --> 01:17:10.600
Okay, the spoon has to be this one because of this little arch way thing going on I refuse to believe they didn't

01:17:17.160 --> 01:17:23.080
We can oh wait, do the wee ones go together? Oh the wee spoons go there

01:17:31.720 --> 01:17:35.000
Well, all done next round, uh, what

01:17:38.040 --> 01:17:40.040
Anything like fine

01:17:41.640 --> 01:17:43.640
No, this is correct

01:17:47.320 --> 01:17:53.640
If I just shake it the game will surely accept it. Can you stack the red spoons again? They're stacked in a weird order

01:17:55.240 --> 01:17:57.240
Sorry, sorry

01:17:57.720 --> 01:17:59.240
Right just type in

01:17:59.240 --> 01:18:00.840
Rebecca's

01:18:00.840 --> 01:18:02.840
Take away, okay

01:18:03.800 --> 01:18:07.720
And you'll understand you'll understand why I go out there

01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:13.000
Because if you've got my accent, would you?

01:18:13.240 --> 01:18:15.240
Wait until you open up

01:18:15.560 --> 01:18:18.040
Today, we're going to pack this customer's order

01:18:19.800 --> 01:18:25.880
They ordered a bit at Becca's munchie belongs. Sorry. The mixer doesn't fit

01:18:35.400 --> 01:18:37.400
Uh-huh

01:18:43.960 --> 01:18:45.960
Uh-huh

01:18:58.200 --> 01:19:00.200
Well, that doesn't go anywhere else either

01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:05.640
Oh, we're opposite Greek and we don't have a paddle. It's the tea infuser

01:19:05.640 --> 01:19:07.640
Oh

01:19:09.480 --> 01:19:13.400
That was very specific. Um, I mean

01:19:14.520 --> 01:19:18.280
It's all right. I'll get I get it. I get it. I could have got the hint because the things

01:19:27.880 --> 01:19:30.680
I'm to go off of pure babes alone

01:19:33.080 --> 01:19:35.080
Oh

01:19:35.640 --> 01:19:40.120
I mean if the game helps me and points them the right way then sure, but uh

01:19:42.200 --> 01:19:44.200
No

01:19:47.720 --> 01:19:49.720
No

01:19:50.840 --> 01:19:52.840
No

01:19:54.280 --> 01:19:56.280
What

01:19:59.720 --> 01:20:01.720
Okay

01:20:03.320 --> 01:20:05.320
Yes

01:20:06.600 --> 01:20:08.600
No, yes

01:20:10.840 --> 01:20:12.840
I want to put it up

01:20:13.800 --> 01:20:15.800
I don't know what's gotten into me today

01:20:17.720 --> 01:20:19.720
It's clearly not

01:20:23.560 --> 01:20:26.600
Stop stop talking do you understand? Okay

01:20:28.280 --> 01:20:30.280
Oh, okay

01:20:31.080 --> 01:20:33.080
Okay

01:20:33.880 --> 01:20:35.880
Okay

01:20:48.440 --> 01:20:50.440
I think we're doing it

01:20:51.160 --> 01:20:53.160
Oh

01:20:59.320 --> 01:21:02.520
Okay, what is this though packing peanuts

01:21:05.000 --> 01:21:09.400
Strawberries and a mid-today we first prepare for the most intense ink extraction

01:21:09.480 --> 01:21:14.280
No, I'm too depressed to express for right now, but uh, oh this looks like a nightmare

01:21:15.080 --> 01:21:18.440
After I have a few days to recover

01:21:19.400 --> 01:21:24.040
Please don't be surprised if I start using my alternative to wear a heck of a lot more

01:21:24.520 --> 01:21:26.760
Oh, wait, is this a hint that the candles go here?

01:21:28.040 --> 01:21:30.040
No

01:21:35.320 --> 01:21:37.320
I'm a bit nervous on this one after

01:21:41.880 --> 01:21:43.880
Right remove everything

01:21:45.320 --> 01:21:47.320
Let's just close the doors not our problem

01:21:49.400 --> 01:21:52.040
It must I hope it was

01:21:59.880 --> 01:22:02.120
Okay, we're a bit of a rough start bit of a rough

01:22:04.440 --> 01:22:08.920
Okay, this can't go sideways so the only place it literally can fit

01:22:12.280 --> 01:22:14.280
Had a lot

01:22:15.320 --> 01:22:17.320
I'm not satisfied

01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:21.000
Oh

01:22:22.200 --> 01:22:24.200
This is a tricky one

01:22:25.960 --> 01:22:28.280
Oh, it's obvious

01:22:32.840 --> 01:22:34.840
Dave

01:22:36.040 --> 01:22:38.040
Oh, I need like

01:22:41.000 --> 01:22:43.000
Oh, this one's a scary one

01:22:49.240 --> 01:22:54.520
Hey, okay, that I'm satisfied with I'm satisfied with that. Okay. Let's get that right. I've got a knife

01:22:57.320 --> 01:22:59.080
Got a knife

01:22:59.080 --> 01:23:00.360
Maybe

01:23:00.360 --> 01:23:04.600
It doesn't seem to go up and down so it has to be so good. So I'm gonna I'm gonna go to PR

01:23:05.880 --> 01:23:07.880
I'm very unconfident

01:23:09.240 --> 01:23:12.520
Sizzlers. Yep. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Let me get up

01:23:13.320 --> 01:23:14.840
Ah

01:23:14.840 --> 01:23:18.920
Usb it can go either way. It was oh no, can I go up and down?

01:23:19.640 --> 01:23:25.560
What was that? No, I saw that I saw that you were trying to turn at something. What were you turning at be honest? Oh

01:23:27.640 --> 01:23:29.880
Okay usb you fit there

01:23:31.080 --> 01:23:35.480
This is a very specific strony. What do you have there a knife? No

01:23:43.480 --> 01:23:45.480
All right, I'm gonna be honest with you

01:23:53.400 --> 01:23:57.000
But there's only one two three four crayons

01:23:59.240 --> 01:24:01.240
Is it possible that

01:24:02.280 --> 01:24:04.920
I mean he fits when I go there. Where were the candles go?

01:24:05.720 --> 01:24:10.200
Well, something please think of the candles the candles don't have a home if you steal them

01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:13.000
I might have to go up here

01:24:14.680 --> 01:24:17.240
Although they don't look very organized up here

01:24:18.920 --> 01:24:22.120
And there's literally nowhere else for them to go so like

01:24:35.880 --> 01:24:37.880
I don't have much faith in this one to be honest

01:24:38.840 --> 01:24:40.840
Why are you going sideways?

01:24:42.840 --> 01:24:49.160
I'm gonna put that one there for now, but I feel like that's a red herring, but it's okay. What do you?

01:24:50.920 --> 01:24:52.920
I don't even want to know what that's useful

01:24:54.760 --> 01:24:57.400
From tall it you have some more candles or more

01:24:59.960 --> 01:25:01.960
But I don't what's

01:25:03.400 --> 01:25:05.400
Maybe it is the section I mean

01:25:08.120 --> 01:25:10.120
Maybe

01:25:14.200 --> 01:25:16.200
They all look like the same height

01:25:18.280 --> 01:25:20.280
Candles go top left

01:25:22.920 --> 01:25:24.920
Oh my god, you're so right

My gosh, what even is this one?

01:40:16.600 --> 01:40:20.440
Due to the high table the capitalistic society

01:40:20.440 --> 01:40:23.960
Yes, you do not actually have to be productive you have been taught this because

01:40:24.760 --> 01:40:27.720
You are to be a made a product of the machine to explore

01:40:30.200 --> 01:40:32.200
What's that a beacher

01:40:32.840 --> 01:40:36.760
A beacher for his radicalizing news more news. It's like

01:40:37.560 --> 01:40:40.600
We are oh, no, this is a nightmare

01:40:41.480 --> 01:40:45.480
Is there obvious ones? I don't want to start putting stuff up until there's obvious

01:40:48.680 --> 01:40:55.880
Feed the machine don't bite the heck I never said to hold 30% back for the tax man for nothing

01:41:00.360 --> 01:41:05.320
And each of her radicalizes you against the high table a smart I am so excited

01:41:06.200 --> 01:41:08.200
So I'm a bit to burp that

01:41:08.680 --> 01:41:15.800
Swallowed the air wrong. I am so excited to record on my meme ASMR. I'm going to do the pregnancy ASMR first because that's hilarious

01:41:18.920 --> 01:41:21.480
Rob, how are you supposed to guess?

01:41:23.560 --> 01:41:25.560
You just have to see what fits

01:41:28.200 --> 01:41:34.520
I'm made to be a product of mommy's honey tea. Okay, that's the only kind of productive a low

01:41:36.280 --> 01:41:38.280
Oh

01:41:38.280 --> 01:41:40.760

01:41:43.800 --> 01:41:45.800
No, I can't be right

01:41:46.600 --> 01:41:47.320
A

01:41:47.320 --> 01:41:49.320
tackle

01:41:49.720 --> 01:41:52.760

01:42:12.680 --> 01:42:15.880
Okay, that looks correct. I'll take that so that can't be correct

01:42:17.960 --> 01:42:20.200
Oh, no, it can't be correct

01:42:26.760 --> 01:42:29.080
Oh, this is not going to be an easy one I'm just

01:42:30.040 --> 01:42:37.080

Okay, okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. All right. All right. All right. All right

01:42:51.480 --> 01:42:55.320
When I realize how everything is set up all I'm saying was going to be a minimum

01:42:56.280 --> 01:43:01.560
Do you get paid minimum wage make sure you put minimum effort in

01:43:17.080 --> 01:43:22.120
Okay, I'm gonna be honest. I think I need to look up a cheesy noodle for this one. This is insane

01:43:23.000 --> 01:43:30.440
This is just a circle. So there it is for the circle. It's just a bit tape. I'm not supposed to do with that

01:43:33.160 --> 01:43:39.480
I think the axe goes where the thought is I'm listening. I'm listening the axe

01:43:42.440 --> 01:43:44.440
Is that what you meant? No

01:43:44.520 --> 01:43:46.520
No, it can't be

01:43:55.960 --> 01:44:01.960

02:02:14.200 --> 02:02:16.200
Oh

02:02:20.040 --> 02:02:22.040
Um

02:02:26.600 --> 02:02:28.920
I need that one to literally go along one

02:02:31.560 --> 02:02:37.240
You're blocking it to go along one. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay

02:02:43.560 --> 02:02:45.560
Oh

02:02:59.800 --> 02:03:01.560
Don't

02:03:01.560 --> 02:03:02.920
Okay

02:03:02.920 --> 02:03:07.080
Yeah, no, they're literally like, yeah, we know you spent an ungodly amount of

02:03:08.120 --> 02:03:12.040
I'm not even doing the second thing. What the heck that was

02:03:12.760 --> 02:03:18.440
Awful, sorry. I had my mouth covered like I had my hand over my mouth. So I'm so sorry if my tracking was like dead

02:03:24.120 --> 02:03:26.120
Oh, they've got wee bonies

02:03:27.800 --> 02:03:29.800
Okay, let's get you nice and polished

02:03:34.920 --> 02:03:38.840
That polish the pedals as well. Oh wait, I need to rotate it, don't I?

02:03:38.840 --> 02:03:40.840
Oh

02:03:43.640 --> 02:03:46.040
No, they get depressed when the catcher's open

02:03:51.640 --> 02:03:53.640
It's a big dramatic for a game like this

02:03:54.920 --> 02:03:58.040
Chapter four in our nature. We may actually do it

02:03:59.720 --> 02:04:01.960
We may actually do it real

02:04:03.240 --> 02:04:05.800
We may be two hours in but we may actually do it

02:04:06.600 --> 02:04:08.600
There's only a little bit

02:04:16.360 --> 02:04:20.600
Oh, I really fixed it everything the cats demolished. Oh, I like that

02:04:31.720 --> 02:04:33.720

The leaves are stopping me from cleaning the plop run

02:06:02.600 --> 02:06:05.320

02:06:51.080 --> 02:06:53.080
My kitty stealing my ring

02:06:55.880 --> 02:07:01.880
Wow, that was a cute one. I like this puzzle and like this chapter

02:07:02.840 --> 02:07:04.840
Oh

02:07:07.480 --> 02:07:10.840
Oh, we're preening so the reason

02:07:19.000 --> 02:07:21.160
I fucking got tame challenge what the fuck

02:07:22.520 --> 02:07:26.760
Oh, god, what the right? That's definitely not doing right. Hold on. Why am I not doing it right?

02:07:29.400 --> 02:07:31.400
Mm-hmm

02:07:32.840 --> 02:07:34.840
Oh

02:07:35.240 --> 02:07:37.240
One

02:07:38.600 --> 02:07:39.560
One

02:07:39.560 --> 02:07:41.480
No, what?

02:07:41.480 --> 02:07:43.480
Right. It can't be that

02:07:43.720 --> 02:07:47.000
Rotate the fuck out of this plank. That's not the mission objective

02:07:51.800 --> 02:07:53.800
Go for symmetry

02:08:01.880 --> 02:08:03.880
So

02:08:23.800 --> 02:08:25.800
Symmetry

02:08:26.680 --> 02:08:28.680
I

02:08:31.720 --> 02:08:33.720
Would not have gotten that ever

02:08:36.360 --> 02:08:41.880
I would not have gone that ever if he didn't say that I would not have figured that out that was far too difficult

02:08:43.320 --> 02:08:46.600
Oh, it's um, okay deep red

02:08:49.960 --> 02:08:54.120
Changing hues thank goodness. I'm not colorblind, huh?

02:08:56.200 --> 02:09:10.600
Yeah, okay. Okay. I saw it. I saw it. I've done something's off for the queue. Perfect. It's the

02:09:14.040 --> 02:09:18.600
This is very bright on me eyeballs. Oh, they're kissing

02:09:26.440 --> 02:09:28.440
Yes, I'm off the screen. Uh

02:09:35.960 --> 02:09:40.360
Which one has the cat on it pick a jar any jar any jar at all

02:09:40.440 --> 02:09:44.920
It's yours. I promise there's money and I'm not scamming pick a jar any jar refling any

02:09:47.560 --> 02:09:49.560
Uh

02:09:50.120 --> 02:09:54.680
Oh, I see it. I see it. I saw it see it see it sword

02:09:55.800 --> 02:09:57.880
Yeah, I see with the leaves even here

02:10:00.280 --> 02:10:02.280
The right jar

02:10:03.480 --> 02:10:08.200
You see emmy's ginger when she's clearly blonde and what universe is she blonde?

02:10:08.360 --> 02:10:15.400
I don't know if this is like a culture thing or something and what universe is any blonde genuinely

02:10:17.240 --> 02:10:19.240
She's clearly a yin-yang

02:10:19.400 --> 02:10:23.240
So I'm not really sure why it's even up for debacle

02:10:23.720 --> 02:10:26.920
I was very surprised when she was like, I'm I'm ginger

02:10:27.720 --> 02:10:31.400
Yes, emmy you literally have orange hair your ginger

02:10:34.200 --> 02:10:38.280
She's definitely blonde. Oh wait, are you being serious or am I getting trolled?

02:10:40.200 --> 02:10:45.240
Am I being trolled? I'm unironically doing a poll right now. I think this must be a culture clash

02:10:45.960 --> 02:10:46.840
because

02:10:46.840 --> 02:10:47.880
uh

02:10:47.880 --> 02:10:49.480
What?

02:10:49.480 --> 02:10:51.480
Oh, that's me. Hi. Um

02:10:52.440 --> 02:10:54.440
Hold on start a poll

02:10:55.720 --> 02:11:00.760
Oh, I just closed the tab. Well, nice try. Let's try that again. We should try another poll. Gee

02:11:01.560 --> 02:11:03.560
Okay, add poll

02:11:04.840 --> 02:11:06.840
What hair

02:11:07.800 --> 02:11:12.440
Hair color do you think emmers is question mark?

02:11:13.400 --> 02:11:14.760
She's

02:11:14.760 --> 02:11:16.760
She's ginger

02:11:17.960 --> 02:11:20.600
Orange and brackets for those of you who are dumb

02:11:21.880 --> 02:11:24.520
Because you're a dumb dumb if you think she's literally blonde

02:11:25.480 --> 02:11:27.480
she's

02:11:27.800 --> 02:11:30.440
Blonde and brackets yellow

02:11:31.960 --> 02:11:33.960
And what?

02:11:46.040 --> 02:11:48.040
Right there we go start full

02:11:48.520 --> 02:11:50.920
Okay, I'm literally doing a poll and chat right now

02:11:51.880 --> 02:11:59.000
What hair color do you think emmy is she's ginger and brackets orange? She's blonde and brackets

02:11:59.480 --> 02:12:05.160
Yellow in what world is she actually blonde? Please be so for real right now. Are you mental?

02:12:07.160 --> 02:12:13.720
I think she's a ginger blonde. No, you cannot be ginger blonde. You're either a ginger or you're a blonde

02:12:14.360 --> 02:12:21.800
She's blonde at the top and it transitions to gingerish near the bottom. I've shown you her concepts are she's a yin or

02:12:23.240 --> 02:12:28.040
Literally pumpkin hair. She's pumpkin themed voodoo doll themed

02:12:28.840 --> 02:12:30.840
She's a yin or

02:12:32.360 --> 02:12:38.920
I hope the last option is now do a poll for as there is hair color. Oh, you guys are gonna be split on that one

02:12:39.480 --> 02:12:48.520
See you elite. I don't 35% of you think she's blonde. I used to be honest. Are you strong? Do you actually think she's blonde?

02:12:49.240 --> 02:12:57.080
Thank you for the tip tiny spainy. How is she blonde? She's orange. She's a pumpkin. Her hair is themed after pumpkins

02:12:58.120 --> 02:12:59.320
orange

02:12:59.320 --> 02:13:00.760
Oh

02:13:00.760 --> 02:13:07.080
Right now to do the real one. Okay. The veal or hair colors are the real a little bit bro, right? Let's do a zero

02:13:07.480 --> 02:13:09.080
Azura's

02:13:09.080 --> 02:13:11.080
hair color is

02:13:13.640 --> 02:13:15.800
Green

02:13:15.800 --> 02:13:17.800
blue

02:13:29.640 --> 02:13:31.640
Okay, there we go

02:13:33.000 --> 02:13:35.720
All right, those never pull up for Azura's hair color

02:13:37.160 --> 02:13:39.160
I

02:13:43.240 --> 02:13:45.400
Your choice is is it green?

02:13:47.560 --> 02:13:49.560
Are you

02:13:50.680 --> 02:13:54.120
I'm not even teal. Are you squidding me right now?

02:13:57.160 --> 02:13:59.800
I don't have a said blonde liar

02:14:00.600 --> 02:14:02.200
absolutely

02:14:02.280 --> 02:14:07.080
Azura is literally a blue green mix. It's called teal. That's what I said. She's teal

02:14:08.520 --> 02:14:15.080
It's awkward marine, which is a shade of green. No, don't say such things. It's seafoam green, which is green

02:14:15.480 --> 02:14:17.880
No, don't say such things

02:14:18.520 --> 02:14:23.320
Do you have long and right? I'll tell you what we're gonna look at. Azura's a seafoam

02:14:23.640 --> 02:14:28.920
Mostly blue with hints of green teal would be mostly green with hints of blue

02:14:29.800 --> 02:14:31.800
Oh

02:14:32.520 --> 02:14:34.520
Are you squidding me right now?

02:14:38.200 --> 02:14:40.600
We're being debated unironically

02:14:41.800 --> 02:14:45.400
Pull up the color chart. You know what maybe her

02:14:47.960 --> 02:14:53.720
Her concept art was a bit more accurate. Thank you tiny spanish. Thank you. Okay. Don't are you squidding me right?

02:14:53.720 --> 02:15:01.560
Maybe it's a strawberry blonde. What universe? Hold on. I'm actually right strawberry blonde

02:15:02.200 --> 02:15:04.200
Let's look it up and ask

02:15:05.560 --> 02:15:07.560
That's orange

02:15:09.880 --> 02:15:14.200
That's all I will literally show you the first picture that shows up

02:15:16.760 --> 02:15:19.100
I'm getting heated. I'm actually getting heated

02:15:21.240 --> 02:15:22.600
That's

02:15:22.600 --> 02:15:24.600
orange

02:15:24.600 --> 02:15:26.600
And what universe?

02:15:29.560 --> 02:15:31.560
Where the fuck is the picture show me

02:15:38.680 --> 02:15:40.680
Okay

02:15:41.000 --> 02:15:43.400
Okay, this is what comes up

02:15:44.360 --> 02:15:48.360
This claw is what comes up when you take strawberry blonde

02:15:49.160 --> 02:15:56.200
It's orange. I'm sorry. It's orange. It's ginger

02:15:57.640 --> 02:15:59.080
Oh my god

02:15:59.080 --> 02:16:05.480
I'm getting trolled so hard. This is ginger. I type in strawberry blonde. Please your blood pressure. That's ginger. Thank you

02:16:07.240 --> 02:16:12.200
And now you're saying Azura's got green hair. I'm getting trolled so hard. Oh my god the first oh

02:16:13.400 --> 02:16:16.120
It's ginger. She's she's a yinya

02:16:18.600 --> 02:16:21.480
Okay, right. Let's unbreak

02:16:28.360 --> 02:16:31.560
The book is a logic puzzle on this yin. Like that?

02:16:40.360 --> 02:16:42.360
What do you mean she's no ginger? I need her

02:16:43.080 --> 02:16:47.080
I birthed her from my lungs. I'm convinced Johnny. She emmys 100 ginger

02:16:48.040 --> 02:16:50.040
She's 100 ginger from the start

02:16:50.760 --> 02:16:54.840
Her concept art. She's a pumpkin. She's based after a pumpkin and a

02:16:56.040 --> 02:16:57.960
voodoo stuff

02:16:57.960 --> 02:17:00.920
I were tame as she's still going down straight. I'm still going

02:17:01.560 --> 02:17:03.560
I'm mlg at this game

02:17:07.400 --> 02:17:13.640
Are you squidding me right now? Ah anonymous you need to visit a doctor. We are very worried for your eyes

02:17:13.800 --> 02:17:21.480
Are you I'm not colorblind. I will rob. I don't know. Um, it must be a culture clash thing. That's just straight up ginger

02:17:23.080 --> 02:17:29.320
Like what do you think a ginger person looks like then and then don't say eric from freaking south part

02:17:33.080 --> 02:17:38.280
What is this I have no idea what i'm doing right now. I'm so sorry

02:17:39.160 --> 02:17:41.160
I

02:17:42.920 --> 02:17:45.640
Don't even have a hint of like where I can put anything

02:17:53.800 --> 02:17:55.800
Speaking of so far crap

02:18:08.280 --> 02:18:10.280
I

02:18:12.120 --> 02:18:14.120
Just make them pairs. I mean I can do that easily

02:18:20.440 --> 02:18:23.880
We'll crab legs are together little horns are together

02:18:25.800 --> 02:18:27.800
With an iron horn

02:18:30.920 --> 02:18:33.800
What? Oh, what was that?

02:18:34.760 --> 02:18:37.960
Are you giving me a hint to where the location

02:18:41.480 --> 02:18:45.320
You see she'll mirror it. Yeah

02:18:54.600 --> 02:18:56.600

Kissing they are kissing those kiss really low

02:19:47.000 --> 02:19:49.000
Nothing can touch

02:19:54.760 --> 02:19:56.760
I

02:19:58.280 --> 02:20:00.280
Put them over here

02:20:44.200 --> 02:20:46.200
Verical mirror image

02:20:47.080 --> 02:20:53.320
You're probably making symmetry. Yeah, but like nothing's like being like I yes, I register in the spot

02:20:55.080 --> 02:20:57.080
Try to find this

02:20:57.480 --> 02:21:01.160
Have you ever done an IQ that yeah, it's gonna be a don't it's our reward though

02:21:01.720 --> 02:21:04.680
It's gonna be a very low result. That's all I can tell you

02:21:05.720 --> 02:21:06.840
Oh

02:21:06.840 --> 02:21:08.840
No, this oh

02:21:09.800 --> 02:21:15.720
It's like half getting dragged half not right close your eyes. I'm sorry. I need to like I don't actually know where it wants

02:21:15.720 --> 02:21:17.800
Fucking throw on the

02:21:45.720 --> 02:21:47.720
Oh

02:22:07.240 --> 02:22:09.880
No pumpkin space not no

02:22:16.520 --> 02:22:20.040
No, no

02:22:25.240 --> 02:22:27.240
Mommy's cooking right now this

02:22:39.960 --> 02:22:41.960
Is that

02:22:42.840 --> 02:22:44.840
Benny

02:22:46.200 --> 02:22:48.200
Benny no

02:22:50.520 --> 02:22:55.880
What what everything is doing a little down to down

02:22:58.440 --> 02:23:00.440
No

02:23:11.960 --> 02:23:13.960
Oh

02:23:23.720 --> 02:23:25.720
The cat literally try to give me a hint

02:23:41.960 --> 02:23:43.960
Oh

02:24:09.800 --> 02:24:11.800
Hydration check replaying

02:24:12.920 --> 02:24:14.920
How long will your donut on me?

02:24:15.000 --> 02:24:19.160
Um, I'm doing a 48 hour one

02:24:19.560 --> 02:24:27.240
Azura has to do a 12 hour one. Um just for living situation, but I think she'll be able to do that after it, which I'm very excited

02:24:30.680 --> 02:24:32.440
Right, okay. Um

02:24:32.440 --> 02:24:36.280
Actually, I need to write Azura's donut phone stuff out because she did it with a bleeding heart

02:24:36.280 --> 02:24:38.760
So I need to come in and be like, okay now do this

02:24:42.760 --> 02:24:44.760
48 hours, yes, uh

02:24:46.680 --> 02:24:50.360
I think mercy will be moved out by the time her donut phone comes around

02:24:51.160 --> 02:24:54.120
So she can do 48 hours as just as there is cases about you

02:24:58.840 --> 02:25:00.840
No, I wanted to make a bulb

02:25:05.800 --> 02:25:07.800
Is this symmetry again

02:25:07.800 --> 02:25:09.800
I

02:25:11.400 --> 02:25:15.080
Is oh my god, hold on. I need to like open my eyes really wait to do this

02:25:19.080 --> 02:25:25.480
Hold on hold on. Sorry. I probably look really weird right now. I need I can't compare if my eyes aren't like wide open

02:25:31.400 --> 02:25:33.400
Hold on

02:25:38.200 --> 02:25:40.200
You

02:25:54.440 --> 02:25:58.280
Uh-huh. Oh you

02:25:58.600 --> 02:26:00.600
Do

02:26:06.040 --> 02:26:08.040
Are you squidding me right now?

02:26:10.040 --> 02:26:17.560
Oh, jackson's job. Hey stony. Thanks for feeling her. Oh, my nice of you. You're welcome. I'm glad you can enjoy the girls

02:26:19.320 --> 02:26:21.320
It's only broken on stream. She's still reading

02:26:23.320 --> 02:26:25.800
I'm like the chat disconnect. I hope no

02:26:26.520 --> 02:26:30.200
Okay, right hold on. I need to do it again

02:26:47.400 --> 02:26:51.560
I can't I don't want to say I can't see it yet, but I can't see it yet

02:26:56.760 --> 02:26:58.920
Is it obvious and maybe

02:27:01.960 --> 02:27:04.840
Oh you you're different

02:27:07.560 --> 02:27:12.760
Okay, we did it. We did it. We did it. We did it. I got it. I got it. I did it

02:27:13.800 --> 02:27:16.280
That was a little harder than I thought. I had to like

02:27:17.960 --> 02:27:23.240
I don't know if you can see how well my eyes track. Uh, but that was like I had to go for it

02:27:24.200 --> 02:27:26.200
Okay rocks

02:27:27.000 --> 02:27:29.000
Man women love rocks

02:27:33.720 --> 02:27:35.720
Gugli eyes

02:27:37.320 --> 02:27:40.440
Gugli gugli eyes sweeties

02:27:44.760 --> 02:27:46.760
Oh

02:27:47.560 --> 02:27:49.560
Oh, I like this one

02:27:50.520 --> 02:27:59.560
I like it very much. It's that's a good one. Very nice. Good one. Good one. I like that one

02:28:07.560 --> 02:28:09.560
Oh, these are lotus seeds

02:28:10.440 --> 02:28:16.360
Oh, they're all seeds. Oh, I love this one. Oh, those are the windfall seeds

02:28:17.080 --> 02:28:19.080
What are you

02:28:30.680 --> 02:28:32.680
I make them kiss

02:28:33.480 --> 02:28:36.120
Oh, no, is it symmetry again? Be honest. I think it may be

02:28:40.120 --> 02:28:42.120
Oh, it's symmetry again. All right

02:28:42.680 --> 02:28:47.000
All right. All right. All right. I know she's about to ask this is her seed spread

02:28:47.640 --> 02:28:52.120
Mommy puzzle moment puzzle. She disconnected from it. Is chat disconnected?

02:28:52.840 --> 02:28:56.760
Will you and the girls ever use scripts posted to read it? No, we need the legal copyright

02:28:57.160 --> 02:29:02.120
Of it. So we can't use that kind of stuff unless like someone came to us and we're like, hey

02:29:03.400 --> 02:29:05.720
I give you all rights to this

02:29:05.720 --> 02:29:07.720
Oh

02:29:10.680 --> 02:29:13.000
But no, we cannot do that for copyright reasons

02:29:17.480 --> 02:29:26.280
Wow, I love this one. It's so pretty just like you're reefing pretty little puzzles

02:29:30.280 --> 02:29:34.040
What are you? I don't even know what seed you are. That's fantastic

02:29:35.720 --> 02:29:37.720
I

02:29:52.280 --> 02:29:55.960
Poppy this is a poppy seed. This is where you get opium from

02:29:58.280 --> 02:30:00.280
Yes, I'm telling the truth

02:30:00.360 --> 02:30:01.800
if you didn't know

02:30:01.880 --> 02:30:06.840
Okay, and where when our derivatives of a plant

02:30:08.280 --> 02:30:14.920
Um for the poppies you have to slash them before they bloom and then they'll secrete the opium

02:30:16.600 --> 02:30:19.800
It's rather fascinating. Honestly, that's why like

02:30:20.760 --> 02:30:28.120
Meth is because it's like lab made it's so dangerous and much more addicting because like literally it was produced to be that way

02:30:28.600 --> 02:30:32.120
So very scary stuff. That's why you should never smoke crack

02:30:33.080 --> 02:30:36.200
Because it's man made and the effects are insane

02:30:36.840 --> 02:30:41.960
Whereas at least if you did her um cooking or heroin, you know, it's from a plant. So

02:30:42.920 --> 02:30:44.760
It's a little bit better

02:30:44.760 --> 02:30:49.560
Because it's not as bad, but it's not necessarily that good as well. So don't get

02:30:49.800 --> 02:30:51.800
Is

02:30:54.600 --> 02:30:58.360
Well, these three are the same color and have stripes these

02:31:00.040 --> 02:31:02.040
Oh, but that one's the same

02:31:03.800 --> 02:31:07.160
You're the only thing we need. Ah, are you so sweet people?

02:31:12.600 --> 02:31:16.440
Well, you ever have male members in veal or sadly not no, um

02:31:17.080 --> 02:31:19.080
The reason veal work is

02:31:19.080 --> 02:31:24.200
You know can work is because the team is female content careers behind the scene

02:31:25.000 --> 02:31:26.280
um

02:31:26.280 --> 02:31:29.400
And unfortunately like I can't advise on male creation because I

02:31:31.560 --> 02:31:33.560
What the heck am I supposed to do

02:31:35.560 --> 02:31:37.560
This one's a curious pale

02:31:39.800 --> 02:31:41.800
Hmm

02:31:41.800 --> 02:31:46.120
Maybe if it's got like black

02:31:49.000 --> 02:31:51.000
Like

02:31:51.160 --> 02:31:53.720
That's got pink pink pink

02:31:56.120 --> 02:31:58.120
Green

02:32:03.160 --> 02:32:07.800
Why am I trying to achieve I'm not really sure I'm trying though

02:32:12.200 --> 02:32:14.200
Oh, this one's tricky

02:32:14.840 --> 02:32:18.520
Competing as a meal. Give me that strontium baby

02:32:20.600 --> 02:32:22.600
Solids in the corner

02:32:27.320 --> 02:32:29.320
Oh

02:32:33.000 --> 02:32:39.160
That's so good. Good catch reflin. That's such a good one. Oh, I like that one

02:32:40.120 --> 02:32:42.120
I would never have thought of that. That was a good one

02:32:45.320 --> 02:32:47.640
Mild case of severe strontia addiction

02:32:48.680 --> 02:32:50.680
Stainless reflin

02:32:51.480 --> 02:32:54.520
Oh dear, right. We need a corner piece if there is any

02:32:56.760 --> 02:32:58.760
Dear

02:32:59.240 --> 02:33:04.040
I really feel like there's much corner pieces at all. Well, maybe you

02:33:09.160 --> 02:33:11.160
Think

02:33:36.840 --> 02:33:38.840
Hmm

02:33:39.160 --> 02:33:54.480
Oh wow, I'm struggling with this one, wait let me kick a little bit though.

02:33:54.480 --> 02:34:09.040
I don't have any corner pieces, how can I be, oh, is it color-

02:34:09.120 --> 02:34:12.720
I can't be color-coordinator, so I'm gonna puzzle together.

02:34:12.720 --> 02:34:17.760
How can a puzzle be a puzzle if it isn't puzzle-together?

02:34:17.760 --> 02:34:20.080
It's a myth.

02:34:20.080 --> 02:34:23.920
No.

02:34:23.920 --> 02:34:33.440
Let me try to quickly find the solution, I'm sorry!

02:34:33.520 --> 02:34:39.120
That was like a corner piece.

02:34:39.120 --> 02:34:44.320
Maybe?

02:34:44.320 --> 02:34:50.080
Pink when you have in top right should be bottom right.

02:34:50.080 --> 02:34:53.040
I knew that.

02:34:53.040 --> 02:34:56.720
You're on about honestly, I'm so obviously-

02:34:56.720 --> 02:35:01.040
I don't know, do you get embarrassed being wrong all the time, refund?

02:35:01.120 --> 02:35:04.400
Let's try to do that.

02:35:06.960 --> 02:35:09.920
Oh that looks right.

02:35:12.480 --> 02:35:17.920
Oh yeah, ooh up a bit.

02:35:20.320 --> 02:35:23.840
Well that looks correct.

02:35:23.840 --> 02:35:26.880
Look they're kissing!

02:35:27.120 --> 02:35:35.280
Hmm, doesn't seem too right on this bit, I'm not convinced.

02:35:35.280 --> 02:35:37.440
Need to kiss another day because I don't think-

02:35:37.440 --> 02:35:41.440
Okay that looks more like a okay, how?

02:35:42.000 --> 02:35:47.440
Okay you, you kiss right now.

02:35:47.440 --> 02:35:58.000
Okay, okay.

02:35:58.000 --> 02:36:08.000
Uh-huh, uh-huh.

02:36:08.000 --> 02:36:15.120
This is not look right to me at all, what the fuck, I see so hard.

02:36:15.200 --> 02:36:21.040
Kicking? I don't know, am I kicking? I don't know what is the little green one

02:36:21.040 --> 02:36:23.680
in between.

02:36:29.680 --> 02:36:34.000
Very true, very true.

02:36:34.000 --> 02:36:37.680
But I cannot do shapes at all.

02:36:38.560 --> 02:36:47.760
Well no, these- right, so don't get rid of it just yet, but-

02:36:49.360 --> 02:36:52.320
Bro, I can't do isometric shapes!

02:36:52.320 --> 02:36:57.280
Oh, what? Nothing fits!

02:36:58.480 --> 02:37:01.760
I don't look right.

02:37:02.240 --> 02:37:05.760
Like that, no.

02:37:05.760 --> 02:37:08.880
Right, okay, hold on.

02:37:09.600 --> 02:37:13.840
It's just- okay, okay, okay.

02:37:14.560 --> 02:37:22.320
Okay, okay, okay.

02:37:22.320 --> 02:37:29.840
I'm here for uh-huh, maybe, possibly, possibly.

02:37:32.320 --> 02:37:38.240
Uh-huh, uh-huh. Okay, okay, don't, don't, don't let up now.

02:37:38.240 --> 02:37:45.040
Don't let up now, oh, oh, oh!

02:37:45.040 --> 02:37:51.760
We did it! That was so good! It all came together!

02:37:51.760 --> 02:37:55.920
Yeah, you can do it, replaying, see? That's proof why you gotta keep

02:37:55.920 --> 02:37:59.200
persevering. It doesn't matter if you keep jamming it in over and over, you'll

02:37:59.200 --> 02:38:01.760
eventually get the result you want.

02:38:01.760 --> 02:38:06.320
Stronikals 2024, thank you.

02:38:06.320 --> 02:38:10.720
Okay, let's see what we're dealing with here.

02:38:12.000 --> 02:38:19.920
Hydration check! What do you mean by that? Hydration, hydration, hydration!

02:38:21.440 --> 02:38:24.720
Are your, are your strontium copium levels going up?

02:38:24.720 --> 02:38:30.240
Know that I can do longer streams again?

02:38:30.240 --> 02:38:37.600
Oh, is this symmetry be honest?

02:38:37.600 --> 02:38:43.920
Oh, actually, I just clicked off him. It is symmetry, right, okay.

02:38:49.040 --> 02:38:52.720
Oh, are we free of restrictions? I thought we had a little more time.

02:38:52.720 --> 02:38:57.280
Um, I'm still feeling depresi-wessy because my dad's gone.

02:38:57.280 --> 02:39:03.600
Um, but I am going to focus on the work that I missed because there's a

02:39:03.600 --> 02:39:07.360
lot of v-tubers that are waiting for me to edit the collabs that

02:39:07.360 --> 02:39:12.480
they were very keen to agree to me with. So I've got a bit of a work ahead but

02:39:12.480 --> 02:39:16.080
don't be surprised when there's a bit of an explosion of ASMR videos on my

02:39:16.080 --> 02:39:19.120
YouTube channel or on Patreon as well.

02:39:19.120 --> 02:39:29.520
Um.

02:39:40.080 --> 02:39:45.520
It's symmetry. Kitty! No, you're doing it.

02:39:46.080 --> 02:39:51.920
Symmetry's in a lot of pockets. Yeah, this seems to be the reason.

02:39:54.320 --> 02:39:58.240
I hope you feel better soon. Yeah, it's trying to explode on Patreon, yeah.

02:39:58.240 --> 02:40:05.920
No worries, take your time, yeah. Um, it's why I picked three shorter games, just...

02:40:06.320 --> 02:40:10.320
Eh.

02:40:14.560 --> 02:40:16.320
Oh wait.

02:40:20.400 --> 02:40:22.320
Is that what I'm supposed to find?

02:40:24.480 --> 02:40:28.320
I think so, I think I just suck on putting it in, please.

02:40:30.640 --> 02:40:34.320
Oh, you zoom out.

02:40:36.800 --> 02:40:40.160
Oh, there's snowflakes.

02:40:40.880 --> 02:40:43.840
That's not right then.

02:40:47.760 --> 02:40:51.760
Did you know something, something snowflakes aren't all equally created or

02:40:51.760 --> 02:40:56.320
something? Ah, I found it.

02:40:58.240 --> 02:41:01.120
Uh, well your gemmets put ASMR in their Patreon channels as well.

02:41:01.120 --> 02:41:07.600
Yes, they already have audios of the variety up.

02:41:07.600 --> 02:41:10.160
More?

02:41:10.160 --> 02:41:14.800
Oh, more.

02:41:21.280 --> 02:41:25.200
Okay, and then we just need the ends.

02:41:25.760 --> 02:41:29.440
They're like little banisters. Okay, this one is a cute one, I like that one.

02:41:29.440 --> 02:41:31.760
That one's a good one, good one.

02:41:31.760 --> 02:41:37.040
Are you gonna make more hypno stuff? Uh, not on Patreon because it's a ban.

02:41:37.040 --> 02:41:41.200
I'm not allowed to put it on Patreon, unfortunately.

02:41:41.200 --> 02:41:49.920
Okay, the section, okay. And this one, that's such a good one.

02:41:49.920 --> 02:41:53.520
I'm here for it, it's a sad one.

02:41:54.480 --> 02:41:59.280
Mmm, but I'll put it up on Twitter, I have a four part series on Twitter.

02:41:59.280 --> 02:42:05.600
Once I edit it, I need to edit it first. I've got a lot of editing I need to do

02:42:05.600 --> 02:42:09.600
actually over the next few days, but I'll get there.

02:42:09.600 --> 02:42:16.000
Um, you just need to let me... Oh, this is such a good one.

02:42:16.000 --> 02:42:19.840
I approve very much of this one.

02:42:19.840 --> 02:42:23.920
Oh, bing.

02:42:23.920 --> 02:42:27.920
Bing, bing. Yeah, that's what I thought.

02:42:27.920 --> 02:42:31.600
You better be bing bonging me.

02:42:38.240 --> 02:42:44.160
Oh, no. Can we release the slides?

02:42:45.120 --> 02:42:48.480
Oh, no.

02:42:48.480 --> 02:42:54.960
Oh, what's that? One, two, three. One, two, three.

02:42:54.960 --> 02:43:01.440
One, two, three, four. One, two, three, four.

02:43:01.440 --> 02:43:10.480
Um, Outside one, uh, Opposite again.

02:43:14.320 --> 02:43:19.520
Oh, there's our spoiler. We fed the spoilers.

02:43:19.520 --> 02:43:23.040
So proud of you working hard for this one. Yeah, I'm glad.

02:43:23.040 --> 02:43:28.640
You guys enjoy. Near Earth organizer, what a strange name for a

02:43:28.640 --> 02:43:31.200
chapter.

02:43:31.920 --> 02:43:35.840
What's this about Hypno? I like Hypno content, but it's banned

02:43:35.840 --> 02:43:40.160
on Patreon, so I have to do it on Twitter.

02:43:44.160 --> 02:44:00.160
Huh?

02:44:00.160 --> 02:44:06.160
Huh?

02:44:06.160 --> 02:44:10.160
What, is it not to go there?

02:44:14.160 --> 02:44:28.160
What's that? Huh?

02:44:28.160 --> 02:44:36.160
Oh my god, we have to tame it.

02:44:36.160 --> 02:44:42.160
It becomes a donut. It goes in the hole. It comes on up.

02:44:42.160 --> 02:44:52.160
Oh, I'm not going to like this one.

02:44:52.160 --> 02:45:02.160
Okay, go here.

02:45:02.160 --> 02:45:08.160
Oh, it's because we're in a coffee shop.

02:45:08.160 --> 02:45:14.160
It's making coffee sound. Oh my god, that's such a strange one.

02:45:14.160 --> 02:45:18.160
Okay, right. Then we're going to bring it back.

02:45:18.160 --> 02:45:22.160
We're going to catch it. Then we've got the apple.

02:45:22.160 --> 02:45:26.160
And we're going to put the apple in the golf.

02:45:26.160 --> 02:45:30.160
Okay, and then we're going to put it in the cup of tea.

02:45:30.160 --> 02:45:34.160
Right.

02:45:34.160 --> 02:45:44.160
Bitch!

02:45:44.160 --> 02:45:48.160
Right, apple into the golf.

02:45:48.160 --> 02:45:52.160
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. You just, you just hold your horses, sir.

02:45:52.160 --> 02:45:58.160
We're going to beat the golf into the constellation which drops into a tea or something. I don't know.

02:45:58.160 --> 02:46:04.160
Oh, do I need to pot it? Maybe I need to pot it.

02:46:04.160 --> 02:46:08.160
Okay, become a donut. Pull back.

02:46:08.160 --> 02:46:14.160
And then loads of gravel here.

02:46:14.160 --> 02:46:18.160
No. No, what?

02:46:18.160 --> 02:46:22.160
Right.

02:46:22.160 --> 02:46:28.160
Oh, no.

02:46:28.160 --> 02:46:34.160
Okay, okay, okay, got worms. So what happens if I make it go right, sir? Does anything happen?

02:46:34.160 --> 02:46:38.160
No, it's wrong. Okay, that's fine. Now I know it's wrong.

02:46:38.160 --> 02:46:42.160
Oh, I've just put that in.

02:46:42.160 --> 02:46:46.160
Right, become a donut. Unbecome a donut.

02:46:46.160 --> 02:46:50.160
Okay, now we've got an apple. Now go to the golf man.

02:46:50.160 --> 02:46:54.160
Beautiful, stunning, gorgeous. Now we are going to turn these right side

02:46:54.160 --> 02:46:58.160
for some ungodly known reason.

02:46:58.160 --> 02:47:02.160
I don't know why, but we are.

02:47:02.160 --> 02:47:06.160
Right, well.

02:47:06.160 --> 02:47:10.160
Oh, God, this is awful.

02:47:10.160 --> 02:47:16.160
What? Am I not to put it in the hole? Be honest.

02:47:16.160 --> 02:47:20.160
Oh, you need to overshoot the hole?

02:47:20.160 --> 02:47:24.160
Who's supposed to figure that out in their day off?

02:47:24.160 --> 02:47:28.160
Honestly. Right, go in the hole.

02:47:28.160 --> 02:47:32.160
Go and become a golf ball. And then

02:47:32.160 --> 02:47:36.160
and then just fucking send it.

02:47:40.160 --> 02:47:44.160
I did that anyway. You're such a stinky game.

02:47:44.160 --> 02:47:48.160
Patreon isn't stingy on it.

02:47:48.160 --> 02:47:52.160
It's actually our Mastercard Overlord.

02:47:52.160 --> 02:47:56.160
That is the reason why you can't do a lot of stuff.

02:47:56.160 --> 02:48:00.160
So always thank you.

02:48:00.160 --> 02:48:04.160
I'm sorry, was that yes to then posting?

02:48:04.160 --> 02:48:08.160
I do it. I don't really ask the girls to do it just because it's a lot of

02:48:08.160 --> 02:48:12.160
extra effort, but I could do it.

02:48:12.160 --> 02:48:16.160
What?

02:48:16.160 --> 02:48:20.160
What?

02:48:20.160 --> 02:48:24.160
Uh, I...

02:48:24.160 --> 02:48:28.160
If you late, save for work, I can maybe get

02:48:28.160 --> 02:48:32.160
Amy to do that.

02:48:32.160 --> 02:48:36.160
You spin me.

02:48:36.160 --> 02:48:40.160
That wanted to stroke midnight or something?

02:48:40.160 --> 02:48:44.160
Wait, really? What's wrong with the two?

02:48:44.160 --> 02:48:48.160
Oh, they dictate the whole world.

02:48:48.160 --> 02:48:52.160
Mastercard dictate everything.

02:48:52.160 --> 02:48:56.160
They are literally our overlords. Like, I'm not even kidding.

02:48:56.160 --> 02:49:00.160
That's not me, like, tinfoil hatin'. They literally call the shots on the internet.

02:49:00.160 --> 02:49:04.160
That's why Patreon ban, like, step...

02:49:04.160 --> 02:49:08.160
Mm-hmm.

02:49:08.160 --> 02:49:12.160
And, like, hypnosis, because they said it's, like,

02:49:12.160 --> 02:49:16.160
there's no consent with it when literally that's

02:49:16.160 --> 02:49:20.160
actually the entire thing about hypnosis.

02:49:20.160 --> 02:49:24.160
Yeah, so you have to...

02:49:24.160 --> 02:49:28.160
What am I doing here? I don't know.

02:49:32.160 --> 02:49:36.160
Is it in the shadow of that line or something?

02:49:36.160 --> 02:49:40.160
Mm-hmm.

02:49:40.160 --> 02:49:44.160
Oh, I was typing it over, so I can mention

02:49:44.160 --> 02:49:48.160
the PMIC process. They control the money.

02:49:48.160 --> 02:49:52.160
Yep, server controls the Mastercard, controls the universe.

02:49:52.160 --> 02:49:56.160
What am I trying to achieve?

02:49:56.160 --> 02:50:00.160
I don't know.

02:50:00.160 --> 02:50:04.160
Um...

02:50:04.160 --> 02:50:08.160
What is this?

02:50:08.160 --> 02:50:12.160
Mommy, I have to ask, but why is the thumbnail...it's glitched. The thumbnail's correct for me on my

02:50:12.160 --> 02:50:16.160
end. I'm not sure why.

02:50:16.160 --> 02:50:20.160
Does it...replay? Hold...right, close your eyes.

02:50:26.160 --> 02:50:30.160
A singular pale?

02:50:30.160 --> 02:50:34.160
A singular pale was my frickin' hint.

02:50:42.160 --> 02:50:46.160
Don't look.

02:50:46.160 --> 02:50:50.160
It's not a wild dog.

02:50:50.160 --> 02:50:54.160
Oh, well, excuse me.

02:50:54.160 --> 02:50:58.160
Hmm.

02:50:58.160 --> 02:51:02.160
I'll try the quick question. How likely will this be?

02:51:02.160 --> 02:51:06.160
Oh, no.

02:51:06.160 --> 02:51:10.160
Huh? Are the shadows wrong? Are these shadows telling

02:51:10.160 --> 02:51:14.160
you what goes in front of them?

02:51:28.160 --> 02:51:32.160
What?

02:51:32.160 --> 02:51:36.160
What?

02:51:36.160 --> 02:51:40.160
The horse just doesn't care.

02:51:40.160 --> 02:51:44.160
He's just off on me.

02:51:44.160 --> 02:51:48.160
Maybe who comes after?

02:51:48.160 --> 02:51:52.160
Okay.

02:51:52.160 --> 02:51:56.160
That doesn't make sense, though.

02:51:56.160 --> 02:52:00.160
Symmetry with a horse in the middle?

02:52:00.160 --> 02:52:04.160
No, those six people.

02:52:04.160 --> 02:52:08.160
Maybe Merritt, hate on the shadows?

02:52:08.160 --> 02:52:12.160
That's a good suggestion.

02:52:12.160 --> 02:52:16.160
Unfortunately, that's not our solution.

02:52:16.160 --> 02:52:20.160
What? Size order?

02:52:20.160 --> 02:52:24.160
I don't know.

02:52:24.160 --> 02:52:28.160
Staircase thing?

02:52:28.160 --> 02:52:32.160
Oh, I just realized I'm covering up half of the puzzle.

02:52:32.160 --> 02:52:36.160
Does that not bother anyone?

02:52:36.160 --> 02:52:40.160
I'll just be a big-headed ass down here about that.

02:52:40.160 --> 02:52:44.160
I don't know what you're talking about.

02:52:44.160 --> 02:52:48.160
Keep playing.

02:52:48.160 --> 02:52:52.160
You can move the shadows.

02:52:52.160 --> 02:52:56.160
No way would they do a silly thing like that.

02:53:04.160 --> 02:53:08.160
The game got real hard to look at every puzzle.

02:53:08.160 --> 02:53:12.160
I think you're original in the right track.

02:53:12.160 --> 02:53:16.160
Oh, it's a constellation.

02:53:22.160 --> 02:53:26.160
What's that?

02:53:26.160 --> 02:53:30.160
I'm too low IQ to discover such.

02:53:30.160 --> 02:53:34.160
What's that? I'm too low IQ to discover such.

02:53:34.160 --> 02:53:38.160
What's that?

02:53:38.160 --> 02:53:42.160
What's that thing?

02:53:42.160 --> 02:53:46.160
I don't know, but it's a map.

02:53:46.160 --> 02:53:50.160
It's not even the map.

02:53:50.160 --> 02:53:54.160
What's that?

02:53:54.160 --> 02:53:58.160
I don't know.

02:53:58.160 --> 02:54:02.160
I don't think so.

02:54:02.160 --> 02:54:31.720
that was me me that's all I'm saying that was not me

02:54:31.720 --> 02:54:45.120
was all the game because what I'm not I mean it's just discovering it itself

02:54:45.120 --> 02:55:03.640
really who's that Pokemon I didn't see the chat I it's just kind of doing it on

02:55:03.640 --> 02:55:09.240
its own I mean I'm not complaining I'll take an easy one kind of sliding in a

02:55:09.240 --> 02:55:24.000
place of it honestly this game I didn't think I was gonna like it as much but

02:55:24.000 --> 02:55:27.280
this is definitely like a solo experience you just want to chill out and

02:55:27.280 --> 02:55:32.120
not really think too hard other than that kitchen one which was a complete

02:55:32.120 --> 02:55:35.800
nonsense that was a bit like I'm not being funny but you're taking the piss

02:55:36.520 --> 02:55:43.720
okay but everything else not really in it oh god I have to organize a desktop you

Burning thing.

03:02:48.040 --> 03:02:50.040
That's a friend turned spell at me.

I need to turn this around.

03:03:09.040 --> 03:03:11.040
So peculiar, truly.

03:03:15.040 --> 03:03:17.040
Yay.

03:03:19.040 --> 03:03:21.040
They're getting bigger.

03:03:21.040 --> 03:03:23.040
Refling, stop getting your tentacles with it.

03:03:23.040 --> 03:03:25.040
No, it's not the tent.

03:03:25.040 --> 03:03:27.040
You're trying to put it with your tent.

03:03:31.040 --> 03:03:33.040
Burn them all again.

03:04:01.040 --> 03:04:03.040
Don't ever touch an open flame in your home, if I will.

03:04:23.040 --> 03:04:25.040
Don't ever touch an open flame in your home, if I will.

03:04:31.040 --> 03:04:33.040
They're straight to me.

03:04:33.040 --> 03:04:35.040
I've got a bit more on you.

03:04:41.040 --> 03:04:43.040
Oh, you were right, Refling.

03:04:43.040 --> 03:04:45.040
Thank you.

03:04:45.040 --> 03:04:47.040
What was the other variation?

03:04:47.040 --> 03:04:49.040
There seems to be another variation, is that one?

03:04:53.040 --> 03:04:55.040
There's another one.

03:04:55.040 --> 03:04:57.040
Right.

03:04:57.040 --> 03:04:59.040
Oh, we've got a glace ball.

03:04:59.040 --> 03:05:01.040
There's another one.

03:05:03.040 --> 03:05:05.040
It looks nice and neat and tidy.

03:05:07.040 --> 03:05:09.040
Let me clean your room again, Refling.

03:05:11.040 --> 03:05:13.040
Your punishment for making me do manual labor.

03:05:13.040 --> 03:05:15.040
Manual labor.

03:05:27.040 --> 03:05:29.040
I'm making lemonade.

03:05:29.040 --> 03:05:31.040
Oh, sweet skull.

03:05:35.040 --> 03:05:37.040
I don't seem to pick up that one.

03:05:43.040 --> 03:05:45.040
There's one of them.

03:05:53.040 --> 03:05:55.040
Oh, I like this.

03:05:55.040 --> 03:05:57.040
Oh, I do.

03:05:57.040 --> 03:05:59.040
I see you, little fella.

03:05:59.040 --> 03:06:01.040
I see you.

03:06:01.040 --> 03:06:03.040
Can you open up?

03:06:03.040 --> 03:06:05.040
Can you open up?

03:06:07.040 --> 03:06:09.040
You better unlock right now.

03:06:09.040 --> 03:06:11.040
Oh, we're going to have problems.

03:06:13.040 --> 03:06:15.040
We're going to have fisty cuffs.

03:06:29.040 --> 03:06:31.040
Please open.

03:06:35.040 --> 03:06:37.040
Oh, the hoops.

03:06:37.040 --> 03:06:39.040
Oh, how creative.

03:06:59.040 --> 03:07:01.040
Nothing.

03:07:03.040 --> 03:07:05.040
Oh, the bits look correct.

03:07:07.040 --> 03:07:09.040
Let's go back to the manual.

03:07:17.040 --> 03:07:19.040
It's all good to me.

03:07:23.040 --> 03:07:25.040
It's really exciting, right?

03:07:37.040 --> 03:07:39.040
Misalignment.

03:07:41.040 --> 03:07:43.040
Misalignment on pixel 234.

03:07:43.040 --> 03:07:45.040
Please correct or you will not proceed.

03:07:45.040 --> 03:07:47.040
I repeat, you will not proceed.

03:07:47.040 --> 03:07:49.040
Let's go back up here.

03:08:05.040 --> 03:08:07.040
Yeah, now the bits are stuck.

03:08:17.040 --> 03:08:19.040
Hmm.

03:08:27.040 --> 03:08:29.040
I don't need to put it on.

03:08:31.040 --> 03:08:33.040
I can fucking chop that fast.

03:08:35.040 --> 03:08:37.040
What is this thing?

03:08:41.040 --> 03:08:43.040
You did that.

03:08:47.040 --> 03:08:49.040
Yeah, it seems to be a misalignment on something.

03:08:51.040 --> 03:08:53.040
Hmm.

03:08:55.040 --> 03:08:57.040
Can you?

03:08:59.040 --> 03:09:01.040
Who or what is misaligned?

03:09:01.040 --> 03:09:03.040
Misaligned.

03:09:13.040 --> 03:09:15.040
I think we may have to skip this one

03:09:17.040 --> 03:09:19.040
to stack the book specifically over the wall.

03:09:19.040 --> 03:09:21.040
The books are all in a line here.

03:09:41.040 --> 03:09:43.040
It like bounces it off because it wants to show you the reflection of the stuff.

03:09:43.040 --> 03:09:45.040
Does that make sense?

03:09:49.040 --> 03:09:51.040
It wants to show you the reflection

03:09:51.040 --> 03:09:53.040
so it's trying to bounce it.

03:09:55.040 --> 03:09:57.040
Who goes there?

03:09:57.040 --> 03:09:59.040
Hmm.

03:09:59.040 --> 03:10:01.040
That's a shame.

03:10:01.040 --> 03:10:03.040
Sorry, I'm satisfied that we did that.

03:10:03.040 --> 03:10:05.040
I don't know how to chop this lemon

03:10:05.040 --> 03:10:07.040
but it seems like a half or another thing.

03:10:13.040 --> 03:10:15.040
We may skip it, you do that.

03:10:15.040 --> 03:10:17.040
I think we did it.

03:10:17.040 --> 03:10:19.040
Yeah, I think we did it.

03:10:19.040 --> 03:10:21.040
Maybe the mirror is supposed to go all the way there.

03:10:29.040 --> 03:10:31.040
I'm clicking that shit as hard as I can.

03:10:31.040 --> 03:10:33.040
I think you need to get the mirror on right away.

03:10:35.040 --> 03:10:37.040
Can you do like a little drive by just so the game moves?

03:10:43.040 --> 03:10:45.040
It looks right to me.

03:10:45.040 --> 03:10:47.040
Oh.

03:10:47.040 --> 03:10:49.040
Open it, put it right.

03:10:49.040 --> 03:10:51.040
And then put it to the right

03:10:51.040 --> 03:10:53.040
for the books and that'll show.

03:10:53.040 --> 03:10:55.040
I think it's being a bit silly.

03:11:03.040 --> 03:11:05.040
I think it's being a silly Billy.

03:11:05.040 --> 03:11:07.040
Hmm.

03:11:07.040 --> 03:11:09.040
Hmm.

03:11:13.040 --> 03:11:15.040
Okay, I think we'll go next.

03:11:15.040 --> 03:11:17.040
Is it let it be mean skip?

03:11:17.040 --> 03:11:19.040
Why would they go let it be?

03:11:23.040 --> 03:11:25.040
Skip a level?

03:11:25.040 --> 03:11:27.040
Yeah, it's because you guys are pissed.

03:11:27.040 --> 03:11:29.040
You didn't code it right.

03:11:29.040 --> 03:11:31.040
I got an achievement for skipping that level.

03:11:35.040 --> 03:11:37.040
Okay, we have...

03:11:37.040 --> 03:11:39.040
Oh, these are those chirpy birds.

03:11:53.040 --> 03:11:55.040
I see all the buttons on.

03:11:55.040 --> 03:11:57.040
I love it already.

03:11:57.040 --> 03:11:59.040
I love not having to think for myself.

03:11:59.040 --> 03:12:01.040
So...

03:12:03.040 --> 03:12:05.040
Surely there's nothing better.

03:12:11.040 --> 03:12:13.040
Um, to make a love fire?

03:12:17.040 --> 03:12:19.040
Okay, off.

03:12:19.040 --> 03:12:21.040
Uh-uh.

03:12:21.040 --> 03:12:23.040
Off, off.

03:12:25.040 --> 03:12:27.040
You're out of alignment.

03:12:27.040 --> 03:12:29.040
You're out of alignment.

03:12:29.040 --> 03:12:31.040
You two are out of alignment.

03:12:39.040 --> 03:12:41.040
Hey, that's a good one.

03:12:41.040 --> 03:12:43.040
That is a really good one.

03:12:43.040 --> 03:12:45.040
I like that one.

03:12:47.040 --> 03:12:49.040
High IQ, highest IQ.

03:12:49.040 --> 03:12:51.040
And velar.

03:12:51.040 --> 03:12:53.040
Not really.

03:12:53.040 --> 03:12:55.040
I screen shot the crate image in Marshmallow.

03:12:55.040 --> 03:12:57.040
Okay.

03:12:57.040 --> 03:12:59.040
What are we doing? I'm doing a little...

03:12:59.040 --> 03:13:01.040
guess the difference.

03:13:01.040 --> 03:13:03.040
Hi, pretty kitty.

03:13:11.040 --> 03:13:13.040
I don't know why, but cats really like when they're...

03:13:17.040 --> 03:13:19.040
I got pet them in rhythm of the...

03:13:21.040 --> 03:13:23.040
You mean your tail pet?

03:13:23.040 --> 03:13:25.040
That's not really, like, feels too much.

03:13:25.040 --> 03:13:27.040
You mean your chest pet?

03:13:31.040 --> 03:13:33.040
You mean your ears?

03:13:33.040 --> 03:13:35.040
Okay.

03:13:35.040 --> 03:13:37.040
You mean your feetsies pet?

03:13:39.040 --> 03:13:41.040
Is that all the space?

03:13:43.040 --> 03:13:45.040
Okay.

03:13:45.040 --> 03:13:47.040
Oh, sorry. You mean your chin pet?

03:13:49.040 --> 03:13:51.040
You're a temperamental little fuck, you know that?

03:13:51.040 --> 03:13:53.040
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

03:13:55.040 --> 03:13:57.040
I just keep head pounding?

03:13:57.040 --> 03:13:59.040
Oh.

03:13:59.040 --> 03:14:01.040
I was literally...

03:14:01.040 --> 03:14:03.040
over-complicating that.

03:14:03.040 --> 03:14:05.040
That was not too early.

03:14:11.040 --> 03:14:13.040
Okay, the speed is changing, which is why my brain...

03:14:13.040 --> 03:14:15.040
Yeah, the speed is changing.

03:14:15.040 --> 03:14:17.040
You fuck.

03:14:17.040 --> 03:14:19.040
Yeah.

03:14:19.040 --> 03:14:21.040
They're changing the speed right at the end.

03:14:23.040 --> 03:14:25.040
They're changing the speed right at the end.

03:14:25.040 --> 03:14:27.040
So my eyes are like, okay, if I...

03:14:27.040 --> 03:14:29.040
maintain that speed, that's what it...

03:14:29.040 --> 03:14:31.040
Yeah, fuck off.

03:14:45.040 --> 03:14:47.040
We did it?

03:14:47.040 --> 03:14:49.040
Mr. Mittens is happy?

03:14:51.040 --> 03:14:53.040
He's gonna claw you?

03:14:53.040 --> 03:14:55.040
Oh, you're so happy.

03:14:55.040 --> 03:14:57.040
I love happy eating.

03:14:59.040 --> 03:15:01.040
Wow.

03:15:01.040 --> 03:15:03.040
Is this it, J.G.?

03:15:03.040 --> 03:15:05.040
We did it!

03:15:07.040 --> 03:15:09.040
Oh, he's actually peeing.

03:15:11.040 --> 03:15:13.040
Oh, we got, like, a little animation.

03:15:13.040 --> 03:15:15.040
A little animation?

03:15:17.040 --> 03:15:19.040
You're feeling very sleepy, Rachel.

03:15:21.040 --> 03:15:23.040
Oh, they're, like, synchronized swimmers!

03:15:35.040 --> 03:15:37.040
I can't interact with...

03:15:37.040 --> 03:15:39.040
nice detail, I see it.

03:15:39.040 --> 03:15:41.040
Oh, no.

03:15:41.040 --> 03:15:43.040
I'm not just enjoying the credits,

03:15:43.040 --> 03:15:45.040
or am I actually to do something here?

03:15:47.040 --> 03:15:49.040
I don't know if this is the credit.

03:15:49.040 --> 03:15:51.040
I'm supposed to do something.

03:15:51.040 --> 03:15:53.040
I can't click on anything.

03:15:53.040 --> 03:15:55.040
Oh, I can.

03:15:59.040 --> 03:16:01.040
Can I shake his butt?

03:16:01.040 --> 03:16:03.040
I can click on me.

03:16:07.040 --> 03:16:09.040
Everyone, let me...

03:16:09.040 --> 03:16:11.040
I'm trying to, like, drag them.

03:16:13.040 --> 03:16:15.040
They're the only things I can grab.

03:16:31.040 --> 03:16:33.040
Oh, right.

03:16:33.040 --> 03:16:35.040
Okay, okay, okay, D.

03:16:39.040 --> 03:16:41.040
Why did you stop? I drink...

03:16:41.040 --> 03:16:43.040
I take a swig of cola and you all stop?

03:16:43.040 --> 03:16:45.040
Right, keep doing... yeah, keep...

03:16:45.040 --> 03:16:47.040
Why are you retained so slowly now?

03:16:47.040 --> 03:16:49.040
You're keeping me up.

03:16:49.040 --> 03:16:51.040
Who's out of alignment? Identify yourself.

03:16:53.040 --> 03:16:55.040
I can't touch anyone.

03:17:03.040 --> 03:17:05.040
Huh?

03:17:05.040 --> 03:17:07.040
No one's letting me touch them.

03:17:09.040 --> 03:17:11.040
Don't you shake your little butts at me.

03:17:13.040 --> 03:17:15.040
Nothing is letting me interact with it.

03:17:15.040 --> 03:17:17.040
Two of them, please.

03:17:17.040 --> 03:17:19.040
I can't grab any of them, though.

03:17:23.040 --> 03:17:25.040
I don't know if you can hear me

03:17:25.040 --> 03:17:27.040
spam-clicking in the background.

03:17:27.040 --> 03:17:29.040
Emmy's rat army merch win.

03:17:29.040 --> 03:17:31.040
No one's letting me touch them

03:17:31.040 --> 03:17:33.040
literally at the convention

03:17:33.040 --> 03:17:35.040
when you guys realize I'm the sexist.

03:17:35.040 --> 03:17:37.040
I saw an image, actually.

03:17:37.040 --> 03:17:39.040
I was going to tweet it out

03:17:39.040 --> 03:17:41.040
and it was a picture of a woman

03:17:41.040 --> 03:17:43.040
putting her hands in

03:17:43.040 --> 03:17:45.040
a guy's pants and I was going to tweet out

03:17:45.040 --> 03:17:47.040
like me at the convention for real.

03:17:47.040 --> 03:17:49.040
When I see you for real, for real,

03:17:49.040 --> 03:17:51.040
but I was like, oh god, that's not going to get me in trouble.

03:17:55.040 --> 03:17:57.040
I am clicking

03:17:57.040 --> 03:17:59.040
everything that will let me touch it.

03:18:01.040 --> 03:18:03.040
I kid you not, I am going absolutely not.

03:18:03.040 --> 03:18:05.040
I think I might have glitched it.

03:18:05.040 --> 03:18:07.040
I don't know if I should rethought

03:18:07.040 --> 03:18:09.040
something. I don't think it calibrated

03:18:09.040 --> 03:18:11.040
right in this instance

03:18:11.040 --> 03:18:13.040
because I'm

03:18:13.040 --> 03:18:15.040
absolutely clicking it otherwise

03:18:15.040 --> 03:18:17.040
and there's nothing hiding behind my head.

03:18:21.040 --> 03:18:23.040
If you did that, you'd be good.

03:18:23.040 --> 03:18:25.040
Who's going to get in trouble? Management?

03:18:25.040 --> 03:18:27.040
What's that? No HR.

03:18:29.040 --> 03:18:31.040
Right, I'm going to reset

03:18:31.040 --> 03:18:33.040
because I'm not sure

03:18:33.040 --> 03:18:35.040
that's working.

03:18:35.040 --> 03:18:37.040
Oh no, don't make me pass it again.

03:18:39.040 --> 03:18:41.040
One,

03:18:41.040 --> 03:18:43.040
two,

03:18:43.040 --> 03:18:45.040
three, uh uh,

03:18:45.040 --> 03:18:47.040
four, uh uh, five,

03:18:47.040 --> 03:18:49.040
six,

03:18:49.040 --> 03:18:51.040
six,

03:18:51.040 --> 03:18:53.040
six,

03:18:53.040 --> 03:18:55.040
seven,

03:18:55.040 --> 03:18:57.040
eight,

03:18:57.040 --> 03:18:59.040
nine,

03:18:59.040 --> 03:19:01.040
10,

03:19:01.040 --> 03:19:03.040
11,

03:19:03.040 --> 03:19:05.040
12,

03:19:05.040 --> 03:19:07.040
13,

03:19:07.040 --> 03:19:09.040
14,

03:19:09.040 --> 03:19:11.040
15,

03:19:11.040 --> 03:19:13.040
16,

03:19:13.040 --> 03:19:15.040
17,

03:19:15.040 --> 03:19:17.040
18,

03:19:17.040 --> 03:19:19.040
19,

03:19:19.040 --> 03:19:21.040
20,

03:19:21.040 --> 03:19:23.040
21,

03:19:23.040 --> 03:19:25.040
22,

03:19:25.040 --> 03:19:27.040
23,

03:19:27.040 --> 03:19:29.040
23,

03:19:29.040 --> 03:19:31.040
24,

03:19:31.040 --> 03:19:33.040
25,

03:19:33.040 --> 03:19:35.040
25,

03:19:35.040 --> 03:19:37.040
26,

03:19:37.040 --> 03:19:39.040
27,

03:19:39.040 --> 03:19:41.040
28,

03:19:41.040 --> 03:19:43.040
29,

03:19:43.040 --> 03:19:45.040
30,

03:19:45.040 --> 03:19:47.040
31,

03:19:47.040 --> 03:19:49.040
32,

03:19:49.040 --> 03:19:51.040
32 pets.

03:19:51.040 --> 03:19:53.040
You learned it here first.

03:19:53.040 --> 03:19:55.040
Sleep.

03:19:59.040 --> 03:20:01.040
What is that thing? Don't ask for permission.

03:20:01.040 --> 03:20:03.040
Ask for forgiveness. Real.

03:20:03.040 --> 03:20:05.040
Real.

03:20:07.040 --> 03:20:09.040
I maybe get six in a row.

03:20:13.040 --> 03:20:15.040
Right, what did I do? I spun him over

03:20:15.040 --> 03:20:17.040
for a little bit.

03:20:17.040 --> 03:20:19.040
We did the one thing.

03:20:19.040 --> 03:20:21.040
Okay.

03:20:23.040 --> 03:20:25.040
Can you go start shaking your booty?

03:20:27.040 --> 03:20:29.040
Oh, yeah, I bogged out.

03:20:33.040 --> 03:20:35.040
What happens if they all kiss

03:20:35.040 --> 03:20:37.040
and love each other?

03:20:37.040 --> 03:20:39.040
No, they're kissing.

03:20:53.040 --> 03:20:55.040
Oh,

03:20:59.040 --> 03:21:01.040
I understand.

03:21:01.040 --> 03:21:03.040
Sorry.

03:21:03.040 --> 03:21:05.040
Oh my god, it's fun to

03:21:05.040 --> 03:21:07.040
with this.

03:21:07.040 --> 03:21:09.040
You will understand that reference

03:21:09.040 --> 03:21:11.040
soon.

03:21:23.040 --> 03:21:25.040
Okay.

03:21:27.040 --> 03:21:29.040
Is this like a mini version

03:21:29.040 --> 03:21:31.040
of all the puzzles I just

03:21:31.040 --> 03:21:33.040
said?

03:21:33.040 --> 03:21:35.040
I think it is.

03:21:45.040 --> 03:21:47.040
Nuts and bolts and bolts and

03:21:47.040 --> 03:21:49.040
nuts.

03:21:49.040 --> 03:21:51.040
Nuts and nuts and bolts and bolts

03:21:51.040 --> 03:21:53.040
and nuts.

03:21:57.040 --> 03:21:59.040
You, you're upside down.

03:21:59.040 --> 03:22:01.040
You're upside down too.

03:22:13.040 --> 03:22:15.040
Oh, my brain can't.

03:22:15.040 --> 03:22:17.040
What?

03:22:17.040 --> 03:22:19.040
I was driving.

03:22:21.040 --> 03:22:23.040
Oh,

03:22:25.040 --> 03:22:27.040
actually.

03:22:27.040 --> 03:22:29.040
Oh, who's not moving

03:22:29.040 --> 03:22:31.040
in the rhythm?

03:22:31.040 --> 03:22:33.040
A bug.

03:22:43.040 --> 03:22:45.040
Oh, a little lady bird.

03:22:47.040 --> 03:22:49.040
Well, multiple lady birds.

03:22:51.040 --> 03:22:53.040
I'll know this fish again.

03:22:53.040 --> 03:22:55.040
No, I'm not having it.

03:22:55.040 --> 03:22:57.040
Yeah.

03:23:03.040 --> 03:23:05.040
There we go.

03:23:05.040 --> 03:23:07.040
A lady bird, yeah.

03:23:07.040 --> 03:23:09.040
No, boo.

03:23:09.040 --> 03:23:11.040
A lady bird.

03:23:11.040 --> 03:23:13.040
You're pretty-ish?

03:23:13.040 --> 03:23:15.040
Yeah, they're called lady birds.

03:23:17.040 --> 03:23:19.040
Oh, my god, we're getting taken away the night.

03:23:19.040 --> 03:23:21.040
What is it? What are we getting?

03:23:21.040 --> 03:23:23.040
Oh, I like this one.

03:23:23.040 --> 03:23:25.040
Oh, sorry.

03:23:25.040 --> 03:23:27.040
Oh, give me more.

03:23:27.040 --> 03:23:29.040
Whatever that was.

03:23:29.040 --> 03:23:31.040
I'll take 19 more.

03:23:31.040 --> 03:23:33.040
No questions asked.

03:23:35.040 --> 03:23:37.040
I'll take it back.

03:23:39.040 --> 03:23:41.040
Okay, there we go.

03:23:41.040 --> 03:23:43.040
What?

03:23:43.040 --> 03:23:45.040
Oh, my god.

03:23:47.040 --> 03:23:49.040
Oh, my god, please.

03:23:49.040 --> 03:23:51.040
More.

03:23:51.040 --> 03:23:53.040
A lady bird.

03:23:53.040 --> 03:23:55.040
A lady bird.

03:23:55.040 --> 03:23:57.040
A lady bird.

03:23:59.040 --> 03:24:01.040
A lady bird.

03:24:01.040 --> 03:24:03.040
Good.

03:24:03.040 --> 03:24:05.040
No.

03:24:05.040 --> 03:24:07.040
A bird.

03:24:07.040 --> 03:24:09.040
Okay.

03:24:09.040 --> 03:24:11.040
Okay.

03:24:11.040 --> 03:24:16.040
Oh, it's a sandwich. It's a lunchbox.

03:24:20.040 --> 03:24:22.040
Get rid of the crumbs. Go away.

03:24:22.040 --> 03:24:23.040
Oh, the crumbs stay.

03:24:23.040 --> 03:24:24.040
Oh, the crumbs stay!

03:24:24.040 --> 03:24:26.040
Put them...

03:24:33.040 --> 03:24:36.040
Oh, the crumbs would go with the bread.

03:24:42.040 --> 03:24:44.040
Maybe that makes more sense.

03:24:57.040 --> 03:24:59.040
Reflings, look away at one.

03:25:00.040 --> 03:25:02.040
Why is that wrong?

03:25:02.040 --> 03:25:04.040
Oh, fuck off.

03:25:05.040 --> 03:25:07.040
You didn't see that.

03:25:07.040 --> 03:25:11.040
You didn't see it, Reflings. You didn't see it.

03:25:13.040 --> 03:25:15.040
Is that crongo? Give me that crongo.

03:25:16.040 --> 03:25:18.040
The bread.

03:25:20.040 --> 03:25:22.040
The asparagus layman?

03:25:23.040 --> 03:25:25.040
Misalignment and asparagus number three.

03:25:25.040 --> 03:25:28.040
You cannot proceed. Do not collect your...

03:25:30.040 --> 03:25:31.040
Oops, sorry.

03:25:32.040 --> 03:25:33.040
Don't look!

03:25:35.040 --> 03:25:36.040
A carrot? What?!

03:25:37.040 --> 03:25:38.040
I'll get a grip.

03:25:38.040 --> 03:25:39.040
What? How?

03:25:43.040 --> 03:25:44.040
What's that?

03:25:45.040 --> 03:25:46.040
What do you want?

03:25:47.040 --> 03:25:48.040
What do you want from me?

03:25:49.040 --> 03:25:51.040
Who are you? Who are they?

03:25:52.040 --> 03:25:53.040
Okay, this is getting a bit ridiculous.

03:25:53.040 --> 03:25:58.040
Sorry. Right, cherry, lemon, tomato and asparagus on the bottom.

03:25:59.040 --> 03:26:00.040
Wait, what?

03:26:01.040 --> 03:26:04.040
Everything I've done is, like, horrifically wrong.

03:26:07.040 --> 03:26:10.040
I'm not being trolled. Wait, I'm being trolled.

03:26:17.040 --> 03:26:20.040
The carrot refuses to go up and down.

03:26:23.040 --> 03:26:25.040
They're refusing to go up and down.

03:26:25.040 --> 03:26:27.040
Oh, god.

03:26:28.040 --> 03:26:30.040
Mm-hmm.

03:26:36.040 --> 03:26:37.040
Right.

03:26:40.040 --> 03:26:41.040
Okay.

03:26:41.040 --> 03:26:42.040
We did it.

03:26:42.040 --> 03:26:44.040
Sorry, I understood what you meant. I'm jolly.

03:26:44.040 --> 03:26:47.040
Thank you for your infinite patience for me, however.

03:26:52.040 --> 03:26:53.040
I love strongy style.

03:26:57.040 --> 03:26:58.040
Okay.

03:27:10.040 --> 03:27:12.040
Is that supposed to mess that up at the end there?

03:27:17.040 --> 03:27:19.040
Wait, the ending doesn't let you do it properly?

03:27:19.040 --> 03:27:21.040
Oh, putters! Hi, putters!

03:27:22.040 --> 03:27:23.040
Hi, yeah.

03:27:23.040 --> 03:27:24.040
Bleep, bleep, bleep!

03:27:27.040 --> 03:27:29.040
Lost the lid to the upper room.

03:27:32.040 --> 03:27:34.040
Oh, we need to help you claim, darling. How do I do that?

03:27:37.040 --> 03:27:38.040
Okay, give me that one.

03:27:38.040 --> 03:27:39.040
No, get rid of that. Give me that one.

03:27:39.040 --> 03:27:41.040
Okay. New level.

03:27:43.040 --> 03:27:44.040
Oh.

03:27:50.040 --> 03:27:52.040
Okay, please stop.

03:27:53.040 --> 03:27:54.040
Mm-hmm.

03:28:04.040 --> 03:28:06.040
Uh-huh, mm-hmm, mm-hmm. Okay, mm-hmm.

03:28:06.040 --> 03:28:07.040
Yes, yes.

03:28:08.040 --> 03:28:09.040
I'm slaying.

03:28:10.040 --> 03:28:11.040
I'm slaying, truly.

03:28:14.040 --> 03:28:16.040
Truly in wholeheart, like, slaying.

03:28:17.040 --> 03:28:18.040
I need another toe one!

03:28:19.040 --> 03:28:21.040
Okay, he needs just the wee one now.

03:28:24.040 --> 03:28:25.040
There you go. Wee!

03:28:26.040 --> 03:28:27.040
Are you doing it, buddy?

03:28:28.040 --> 03:28:29.040
You're going for the moon.

03:28:30.040 --> 03:28:31.040
I don't even know that one.

03:28:31.040 --> 03:28:32.040
Let's do a toe.

03:28:33.040 --> 03:28:34.040
Yep. Nope.

03:28:35.040 --> 03:28:36.040
Yep.

03:28:36.040 --> 03:28:37.040
Mm-hmm.

03:28:37.040 --> 03:28:38.040
Wee-yep.

03:28:39.040 --> 03:28:40.040
Then a little one.

03:28:40.040 --> 03:28:41.040
Then a little small one.

03:28:42.040 --> 03:28:44.040
Then an even skinnier, malincier one.

03:28:45.040 --> 03:28:46.040
Yeah, I'm windy.

03:28:47.040 --> 03:28:48.040
I'm windy, okay.

03:28:52.040 --> 03:28:53.040
I don't know why it's jiggling.

03:28:58.040 --> 03:29:00.040
What, can I only do wee one?

03:29:06.040 --> 03:29:07.040
Oh, I can't remove it.

03:29:09.040 --> 03:29:10.040
Don't let me add it.

03:29:10.040 --> 03:29:11.040
Don't let me add it.

03:29:11.040 --> 03:29:13.040
I need to, like, fucking label block one.

03:29:15.040 --> 03:29:18.040
The game's actually making sweat work!

03:29:20.040 --> 03:29:21.040
Let's go high.

03:29:21.040 --> 03:29:23.040
It won't let me remove, so...

03:29:24.040 --> 03:29:26.040
Give me a wee skinny one!

03:29:32.040 --> 03:29:34.040
It doesn't like that one a lot.

03:29:34.040 --> 03:29:35.040
But it doesn't want me to remove it.

03:29:35.040 --> 03:29:36.040
I don't want to remove it.

03:29:37.040 --> 03:29:38.040
I don't want to remove it.

03:29:38.040 --> 03:29:39.040
I don't want to remove it.

03:29:39.040 --> 03:29:40.040
That one a lot.

03:29:40.040 --> 03:29:42.040
But it doesn't like anything else either.

03:29:42.040 --> 03:29:44.040
It only is the second wee one.

03:29:50.040 --> 03:29:51.040
That was rather bizarre.

03:29:51.040 --> 03:29:52.040
Hydration check.

03:29:55.040 --> 03:29:56.040
Evil hydrate.

03:30:03.040 --> 03:30:04.040
Honestly, I'd rather...

03:30:04.040 --> 03:30:05.040
I'd rather...

03:30:11.040 --> 03:30:13.040
Because it's not being mean.

03:30:13.040 --> 03:30:15.040
Like, it's not like it's not cycling through it.

03:30:16.040 --> 03:30:18.040
No, don't start wobbling again.

03:30:18.040 --> 03:30:19.040
You're so dramatic.

03:30:31.040 --> 03:30:32.040
I'm losing a little bit.

03:30:32.040 --> 03:30:33.040
Just a little bit.

03:30:35.040 --> 03:30:37.040
I need a wee one.

03:30:38.040 --> 03:30:39.040
A wee short one.

03:30:39.040 --> 03:30:40.040
There's a wee short one.

03:30:40.040 --> 03:30:41.040
Aye, two wee short ones, I'll do that.

03:30:42.040 --> 03:30:43.040
And then, like, the...

03:30:43.040 --> 03:30:44.040
These wee medium ones.

03:30:47.040 --> 03:30:48.040
Nope.

03:30:48.040 --> 03:30:49.040
Yep.

03:30:49.040 --> 03:30:50.040
Yep.

03:30:51.040 --> 03:30:52.040
Nope.

03:30:52.040 --> 03:30:53.040
Yep.

03:30:53.040 --> 03:30:54.040
Yep.

03:30:54.040 --> 03:30:56.040
No, then it'll lean into a piece of me.

03:30:56.040 --> 03:30:57.040
That's correct.

03:31:00.040 --> 03:31:02.040
I'm not sure what the requirements are.

03:31:02.040 --> 03:31:04.040
Is it, like, the colour scheme thing?

03:31:12.040 --> 03:31:13.040
Is it too high?

03:31:13.040 --> 03:31:14.040
It has the colour match?

03:31:14.040 --> 03:31:15.040
Don't see such things.

03:31:20.040 --> 03:31:21.040
What is that?

03:31:21.040 --> 03:31:23.040
Oh, it does have the colour match!

03:31:26.040 --> 03:31:27.040
Why would you do such a thing?

03:31:28.040 --> 03:31:31.040
Am I supposed to just wait for yellow only then?

03:31:33.040 --> 03:31:35.040
Oh, my God, you're so right, is...

03:31:38.040 --> 03:31:40.040
And then I need a skinny red one.

03:31:40.040 --> 03:31:41.040
No, like a wee one.

03:31:41.040 --> 03:31:42.040
Yeah!

03:31:42.040 --> 03:31:43.040
Oh, close enough.

03:31:43.040 --> 03:31:44.040
Kind of.

03:31:46.040 --> 03:31:47.040
Right, I need a wee wee wee.

03:31:47.040 --> 03:31:48.040
A wee wee red one.

03:31:50.040 --> 03:31:52.040
To say red in French, you say...

03:31:54.040 --> 03:31:56.040
You say pink in French, you say...

03:31:58.040 --> 03:32:00.040
What colour is this thing called?

03:32:00.040 --> 03:32:02.040
I can't believe I didn't figure that out.

03:32:03.040 --> 03:32:06.040
So you're telling me I was just getting lucky this entire time?

03:32:06.040 --> 03:32:07.040
I believe it.

03:32:13.040 --> 03:32:15.040
I just need a long one.

03:32:15.040 --> 03:32:17.040
I need a long one and then I can put a wee one on it.

03:32:17.040 --> 03:32:18.040
Long!

03:32:18.040 --> 03:32:19.040
Or two mediums.

03:32:20.040 --> 03:32:21.040
I'll take it.

03:32:21.040 --> 03:32:22.040
Beak.

03:32:25.040 --> 03:32:26.040
Beak.

03:32:26.040 --> 03:32:27.040
Play, dee-play.

03:32:30.040 --> 03:32:31.040
What do we do?

03:32:31.040 --> 03:32:32.040
Grey?

03:32:32.040 --> 03:32:34.040
You've given me grey, so why not?

03:32:34.040 --> 03:32:35.040
I don't know, it's too big.

03:32:39.040 --> 03:32:42.040
Complete the timer by using every available spot.

03:32:45.040 --> 03:32:46.040
Done?

03:32:47.040 --> 03:32:50.040
Where there's the cat under the tree.

03:32:50.040 --> 03:32:55.040
Under the moon and he's fleeing with it like it's yarn.

03:32:56.040 --> 03:32:59.040
Then the cat is over the moon

03:33:00.040 --> 03:33:02.040
and he's purring in the moon.

03:33:04.040 --> 03:33:06.040
Thank you for listening to my song about the cat.

03:33:08.040 --> 03:33:09.040
Now knock it over.

03:33:09.040 --> 03:33:11.040
Honestly, cat behaviour.

03:33:15.040 --> 03:33:17.040
What an interesting game.

03:33:18.040 --> 03:33:20.040
Cat is ascending in the air.

03:33:28.040 --> 03:33:29.040
Wah, a cozy completion.

03:33:29.040 --> 03:33:31.040
Complete the campaign mode.

03:33:31.040 --> 03:33:34.040
That was actually so surprisingly nice.

03:33:35.040 --> 03:33:37.040
Oh well, I get to be the cat now.

03:33:38.040 --> 03:33:40.040
Oh my god, Anne McMillan.

03:33:40.040 --> 03:33:42.040
How could we have done that without you?

03:33:42.040 --> 03:33:45.040
Lucas, don't forget we didn't have you near about you as well.

03:33:46.040 --> 03:33:48.040
We're messing it all up.

03:33:50.040 --> 03:33:53.040
What, I honestly thought...

03:33:54.040 --> 03:33:56.040
I'm gonna say something really mean.

03:33:56.040 --> 03:33:59.040
I thought that was gonna be rubbish.

03:33:59.040 --> 03:34:00.040
But it was, Ney.

03:34:00.040 --> 03:34:02.040
It was actually really good.

03:34:02.040 --> 03:34:04.040
So is VV right or wrong?

03:34:05.040 --> 03:34:07.040
Controversial take?

03:34:09.040 --> 03:34:12.040
Is that Australian VTuber was wrong?

03:34:13.040 --> 03:34:15.040
I thought that was gonna be rubbish.

03:34:16.040 --> 03:34:18.040
But I really enjoyed that.

03:34:19.040 --> 03:34:21.040
I don't know, what do you think?

03:34:22.040 --> 03:34:23.040
Have you played it?

03:34:23.040 --> 03:34:26.040
And if you haven't played it, did you...

03:34:26.040 --> 03:34:28.040
Did I make you want to give it a shot?

03:34:28.040 --> 03:34:30.040
It's like one of those games where you can tune out to this.

03:34:31.040 --> 03:34:33.040
Other than the fridge one.

03:34:33.040 --> 03:34:35.040
Sorry, I'm writing a review on the fridge one.

03:34:35.040 --> 03:34:36.040
I don't care.

03:34:36.040 --> 03:34:37.040
That fridge one makes no sense.

03:34:37.040 --> 03:34:39.040
They need to make it more obvious.

03:34:39.040 --> 03:34:40.040
I said what I said.

03:34:41.040 --> 03:34:43.040
VV, actually VV was wrong.

03:34:43.040 --> 03:34:44.040
Congrats.

03:34:44.040 --> 03:34:45.040
We're gonna have to tune back.

03:34:45.040 --> 03:34:46.040
No.

03:34:46.040 --> 03:34:49.040
Might not stand up to many people.

03:34:49.040 --> 03:34:50.040
No, you can replay it.

03:34:50.040 --> 03:34:51.040
No.

03:34:51.040 --> 03:34:53.040
A good start to a game.

03:34:53.040 --> 03:34:54.040
Definitely.

03:34:54.040 --> 03:34:58.040
I think that's definitely for more casual VTubers

03:34:58.040 --> 03:35:03.040
that don't necessarily need something hyper intense.

03:35:03.040 --> 03:35:07.040
They just want to have a nice chat and enjoy the experience.

03:35:07.040 --> 03:35:11.040
I'd say that was pretty dang bandabi-dosey, honestly.

03:35:11.040 --> 03:35:13.040
Never forget to paint the tools.

03:35:13.040 --> 03:35:20.040
Now, I will say, I suspect VV never actually checked the hints.

03:35:20.040 --> 03:35:23.040
VV and strongy drama confront?

03:35:23.040 --> 03:35:24.040
No.

03:35:24.040 --> 03:35:28.040
I'm gonna guess she purposely did it where she didn't look at the hints.

03:35:28.040 --> 03:35:32.040
Because I looked at the hints, obviously I was like, well, I know what to do.

03:35:33.040 --> 03:35:36.040
It was actually mostly fun because you played it.

03:35:36.040 --> 03:35:37.040
Love the kit.

03:35:40.040 --> 03:35:44.040
I was just so worried when I'm like, oh no, it may be a boring game.

03:35:44.040 --> 03:35:46.040
These things might not find me.

03:35:46.040 --> 03:35:50.040
VV actively avoided the hints function because she's a completionist.

03:35:50.040 --> 03:35:51.040
Ah yes, okay.

03:35:51.040 --> 03:35:56.040
I suspected that because with the hints then you can make it work.

03:35:57.040 --> 03:36:01.040
You could do it in the future to get the solutions you want.

03:36:03.040 --> 03:36:04.040
Do you want to play more puzzle games?

03:36:04.040 --> 03:36:06.040
You could try the Talos principle.

03:36:06.040 --> 03:36:07.040
I found it tough.

03:36:07.040 --> 03:36:08.040
Oh, I'm very dumb.

03:36:11.040 --> 03:36:12.040
It's super fun.

03:36:12.040 --> 03:36:15.040
The alternative solutions on some of these are wild.

03:36:15.040 --> 03:36:18.040
The game works pretty well if you can borrow brain cells.

03:36:18.040 --> 03:36:20.040
Literally, thank you for carrying me.

03:36:20.040 --> 03:36:22.040
Thank you so much for stream sniping.

03:36:22.040 --> 03:36:23.040
Oh no, it's not called stream sniping.

03:36:23.040 --> 03:36:25.040
It's called backseat gaming.

03:36:25.040 --> 03:36:27.040
I love backseat gaming.

03:36:27.040 --> 03:36:29.040
Ah, please do it more to me.

03:36:29.040 --> 03:36:30.040
Sorry, I'm stretching when I did that.

03:36:30.040 --> 03:36:31.040
So I got really late there.

03:36:31.040 --> 03:36:33.040
Sorry if I scared anyone.

03:36:33.040 --> 03:36:34.040
I did a stretch.

03:36:34.040 --> 03:36:35.040
I switched.

03:36:35.040 --> 03:36:37.040
I did big switch.

03:36:37.040 --> 03:36:39.040
Oh, nowhere.

03:36:43.040 --> 03:36:46.040
Are these all the creator's pets?

03:36:46.040 --> 03:36:47.040
I'm going to agree.

03:36:47.040 --> 03:36:49.040
That's so wholesome.

03:36:52.040 --> 03:36:53.040
I love it.

03:36:53.040 --> 03:36:54.040
I love it.

03:36:54.040 --> 03:36:57.040
Honestly, I'm going to say something controversial.

03:36:57.040 --> 03:36:59.040
10 out of 10.

03:37:00.040 --> 03:37:02.040
10 out of 10.

03:37:03.040 --> 03:37:05.040
Sorry, it was.

03:37:05.040 --> 03:37:07.040
That was such a good experience.

03:37:09.040 --> 03:37:14.040
You've got a cute little lane where the cat is winding you up through the whole thing.

03:37:14.040 --> 03:37:17.040
Controversial, but 10 out of 10.

03:37:17.040 --> 03:37:20.040
Literally, I didn't expect that.

03:37:20.040 --> 03:37:22.040
Have you ever played Catherine?

03:37:22.040 --> 03:37:24.040
No, but I'm aware of it.

03:37:24.040 --> 03:37:28.040
And I know it's a puzzle game and there's no chance I'm going to win without dying.

03:37:28.040 --> 03:37:33.040
So I would get too frustrated and start screaming at the game and then close it.

03:37:34.040 --> 03:37:36.040
I think you're guessing a bit too much.

03:37:36.040 --> 03:37:38.040
You didn't like that.

03:37:38.040 --> 03:37:48.040
Maybe you guys made it really enjoyable for me, but I found that rather pleasant gaming experience.

03:37:48.040 --> 03:37:52.040
Now, there's not many games that you can describe as pleasant.

03:37:52.040 --> 03:37:57.040
And this, I would say, was such a pleasant environment.

03:37:57.040 --> 03:38:06.040
The music, the little plot of her little pudders, annoying as, you know, I thoroughly enjoyed that.

03:38:06.040 --> 03:38:14.040
Maybe you made it more enjoyable than I originally would rate it if I was just on my own some lonesome, but that was, I enjoyed that.

03:38:14.040 --> 03:38:17.040
I don't think it was bad, but it's not 10 out of 10.

03:38:17.040 --> 03:38:24.040
When you think of a game, you have to remove what you want to see in a game.

03:38:24.040 --> 03:38:30.040
Because I would ask you, if you don't rate it at 10 out of 10, what would you do to improve it?

03:38:30.040 --> 03:38:38.040
And you have to be careful with that question, because if what you're going to do to improve it would completely change up what the core purpose of the game is,

03:38:38.040 --> 03:38:43.040
which is kind of relaxing, kind of puzzler environment.

03:38:43.040 --> 03:38:47.040
And it's not really environment, because you're not really 3D, are you?

03:38:47.040 --> 03:38:52.040
Like, did the development team achieve what they wanted to achieve with this game?

03:38:52.040 --> 03:38:56.040
I would say, yes, they hit the nail on the head, it's a 10 out of 10.

03:38:56.040 --> 03:38:58.040
You're relaxed, you're playing puzzles.

03:38:58.040 --> 03:39:03.040
Yeah, it gets a bit frustrating, but they've literally got the hints ready right for you to be like, hey, we've got this.

03:39:03.040 --> 03:39:06.040
Now, yeah, we ran into like, I think, what, two unpolished bugs?

03:39:06.040 --> 03:39:08.040
Rather than that.

03:39:08.040 --> 03:39:09.040
Who's this?

03:39:09.040 --> 03:39:11.040
It was pleasant to what you played.

03:39:11.040 --> 03:39:13.040
Johnny, it's a 10 out of 10.

03:39:13.040 --> 03:39:16.040
Yeah, also me with Edith Finch.

03:39:16.040 --> 03:39:18.040
Yeah, 8 out of 10, yeah.

03:39:18.040 --> 03:39:20.040
Yeah, that's terrible.

03:39:20.040 --> 03:39:22.040
I have a rubbish rating system, okay?

03:39:22.040 --> 03:39:25.040
Well, you did already criticise the fridge puzzle.

03:39:25.040 --> 03:39:28.040
Yes, now, whether or not that's a...

03:39:28.040 --> 03:39:35.040
I'm going to, like, if I look it up and everyone agrees that the fridge puzzle needs a bit of alteration, then sure.

03:39:36.040 --> 03:39:38.040
It depends how you rate games.

03:39:38.040 --> 03:39:42.040
Well, you can't go, you can't rate a game objectively.

03:39:42.040 --> 03:39:47.040
Right, this sounds really sad, but I want to rate video games in the future, and like, I did my research...

03:39:47.040 --> 03:39:50.040
I did my research, I'll shut the fuck up, Johnny.

03:39:50.040 --> 03:39:58.040
I researched it into it, and like, you have to remove your bias, because if you were to compare this game to Call of Duty,

03:39:58.040 --> 03:40:01.040
yeah, of course it's a resident sleeper game.

03:40:01.040 --> 03:40:05.040
You have to judge the game based on what the game is giving you.

03:40:05.040 --> 03:40:11.040
You have to remove your bias as well, because my preference is, like, you know, something exciting,

03:40:11.040 --> 03:40:14.040
but I don't want to get stalled in the progress type thing.

03:40:14.040 --> 03:40:20.040
But I need to read... I need to remove my bias in a game type. Does that make sense?

03:40:20.040 --> 03:40:22.040
Makes sense?

03:40:22.040 --> 03:40:24.040
We need an expert game journal.

03:40:24.040 --> 03:40:29.040
I'm going to attempt to do a review on Assassin's Creed Brotherhood,

03:40:29.040 --> 03:40:33.040
and then a review on Isaac as my Donathon Rewards.

03:40:33.040 --> 03:40:39.040
Now, in before, they're just absolutely catastrophic failures, but I want to give it a chance.

03:40:48.040 --> 03:40:51.040
You need to compare it to other puzzlers in the genre.

03:40:51.040 --> 03:40:57.040
Stick to the genre. You need to kind of, like, be able to identify what the dev team we're going for,

03:40:57.040 --> 03:41:01.040
did they achieve it, you know, all these kind of things.

03:41:01.040 --> 03:41:04.040
Finally, yapping is back. Stop!

03:41:04.040 --> 03:41:08.040
Catastrophic. I've always wanted to be a game critic, but that's how I review games.

03:41:08.040 --> 03:41:12.040
Yes. Attempting to have an objective eye is a good instinct, but impossible.

03:41:12.040 --> 03:41:14.040
Hold those both in your head and you'll be fine.

03:41:14.040 --> 03:41:16.040
Yes, so like, obviously, I'll be biased.

03:41:16.040 --> 03:41:19.040
I'll be like, Assassin's Creed Brotherhood, 10 out of 10, best game of all time.

03:41:19.040 --> 03:41:27.040
I've missed out if you have not played it. The graphic, you know, does the game live up to a dated, you know, time period and all that?

03:41:27.040 --> 03:41:32.040
Actually, yes. But then again, I have a personal bias, and when I review the game, I'll say that I have an insane personal bias

03:41:32.040 --> 03:41:35.040
because it also has a nostalgic factor for me.

03:41:35.040 --> 03:41:41.040
Nostalgia is a billion dollar industry.

03:41:41.040 --> 03:41:45.040
Billion dollar for nostalgia, okay?

03:41:45.040 --> 03:41:50.040
The emotional nostalgia cannot be artificially recreated.

03:41:50.040 --> 03:41:58.040
You must have experienced it at a younger age to create the pathways in your brain of familiarity.

03:41:58.040 --> 03:42:01.040
You didn't know your brain adores familiarity.

03:42:01.040 --> 03:42:11.040
It is not like going out of its way to learn new things because that takes effort, that takes brain power, that takes, you know, motivation to learn, take things.

03:42:11.040 --> 03:42:18.040
That is why nostalgia is an insane drug that cannot be created in a lab.

03:42:18.040 --> 03:42:24.040
I could go on a big massive rant about how powerful the nostalgia is.

03:42:24.040 --> 03:42:27.040
You know, for example, you see this meme in passing.

03:42:27.040 --> 03:42:35.040
When you get, like, a whiff of your childhood and, like, you walk past somewhere and you can, like, smell your childhood and you get, like, flashed back

03:42:35.040 --> 03:42:40.040
and you never get the flash again because you don't know what the smell was type thing, okay?

03:42:40.040 --> 03:42:42.040
You know what I mean?

03:42:42.040 --> 03:42:45.040
Honest life, yeah.

03:42:45.040 --> 03:42:49.040
But that's my teaching about it.

03:42:49.040 --> 03:42:53.040
Nostalgia in the next teaching stream?

03:42:53.040 --> 03:42:57.040
Uh, yeah, I wouldn't mind doing that at all.

03:42:57.040 --> 03:43:00.040
I think I may stop the teaching stream just a little bit though.

03:43:00.040 --> 03:43:01.040
Just a little bit.

03:43:01.040 --> 03:43:03.040
But that's okay.

03:43:03.040 --> 03:43:05.040
You usually want to stream or play this.

03:43:05.040 --> 03:43:09.040
I check it out to see their experience with it, but they eventually have it in the background.

03:43:09.040 --> 03:43:11.040
One of the camera streams for this.

03:43:11.040 --> 03:43:13.040
I'd be more interested and curious.

03:43:13.040 --> 03:43:17.040
I was only camp because I knew you guys would carry me through the game.

03:43:17.040 --> 03:43:22.040
You guys would tell me smell and memory near the place of the rain.

03:43:22.040 --> 03:43:24.040
Are you listening to an old song?

03:43:24.040 --> 03:43:25.040
The teaching was fun.

03:43:25.040 --> 03:43:28.040
Literally first day that's joining in goes for four hours.

03:43:28.040 --> 03:43:31.040
Star has already been four hours.

03:43:31.040 --> 03:43:35.040
I won't, no, I'll ramble for a bit, but I can't.

03:43:35.040 --> 03:43:37.040
Is Emmy coming on?

03:43:38.040 --> 03:43:40.040
We can maybe redirect into Emmy.

03:43:40.040 --> 03:43:41.040
When does Emmy come on?

03:43:41.040 --> 03:43:44.040
Sorry, the background music's gonna dissipate.

03:43:44.040 --> 03:43:49.040
Oh, Emmy, are you coming on to this, darling?

03:43:49.040 --> 03:43:51.040
Are you coming?

03:43:51.040 --> 03:43:52.040
Are you coming?

03:43:52.040 --> 03:43:53.040
Sorry.

03:43:53.040 --> 03:43:54.040
Shut the fuck up.

03:43:54.040 --> 03:43:55.040
I'm so excited.

03:43:55.040 --> 03:43:56.040
Sorry.

03:43:56.040 --> 03:43:59.040
I'm so excited to just be back doing long streams again.

03:43:59.040 --> 03:44:00.040
I'm sorry.

03:44:00.040 --> 03:44:02.040
That was wildly inappropriate.

03:44:02.040 --> 03:44:03.040
Oh, stop.

03:44:03.040 --> 03:44:04.040
I'm getting excited.

03:44:04.040 --> 03:44:09.040
I've literally just played a puzzle game and I'm like, oh, not today.

03:44:09.040 --> 03:44:12.040
Okay, I'm on my own some lonesome today.

03:44:12.040 --> 03:44:15.040
Well, we can just be in San Juman.

03:44:15.040 --> 03:44:16.040
I'm so so so.

03:44:16.040 --> 03:44:18.040
Stonny's energy is coming back.

03:44:18.040 --> 03:44:19.040
That's it.

03:44:19.040 --> 03:44:20.040
Any more energy?

03:44:23.040 --> 03:44:27.040
Oh, my YouTube short about how much does a small agency make?

03:44:27.040 --> 03:44:29.040
It got one out of ten.

03:44:29.040 --> 03:44:31.040
Oh my God.

03:44:31.040 --> 03:44:33.040
And you guys are liking it.

03:44:33.040 --> 03:44:34.040
Hold on.

03:44:34.040 --> 03:44:37.040
Oh, I'm accidentally recording my screen eat.

03:44:37.040 --> 03:44:39.040
I hate when my PC does that.

03:44:39.040 --> 03:44:40.040
I try.

03:44:40.040 --> 03:44:44.040
I do a screenshot and then it's like screen recording everything.

03:44:44.040 --> 03:44:47.040
And I'm like, bro, can you not?

03:44:52.040 --> 03:44:53.040
Hold on.

03:44:53.040 --> 03:44:54.040
See this PC?

03:44:54.040 --> 03:44:56.040
I'm actually gonna fart in its mouth.

03:44:56.040 --> 03:44:58.040
This is such a rubbish PC.

03:44:59.040 --> 03:45:01.040
Oh, that's a bit big.

03:45:01.040 --> 03:45:02.040
You know what else is big?

03:45:02.040 --> 03:45:03.040
Mal willy.

03:45:03.040 --> 03:45:04.040
Sorry.

03:45:04.040 --> 03:45:06.040
I'm so excited to be able to do longer streams again.

03:45:06.040 --> 03:45:09.040
And I know I've got shorter streams for tomorrow and the other day.

03:45:09.040 --> 03:45:13.040
Mercy's streaming at 10 a.m. my time or your time?

03:45:13.040 --> 03:45:15.040
Because it's 7 a.m. right now.

03:45:15.040 --> 03:45:16.040
I'm not sure I can yet.

03:45:16.040 --> 03:45:17.040
Can I really yet?

03:45:17.040 --> 03:45:19.040
Can I yet for two more hours?

03:45:19.040 --> 03:45:21.040
Sadly no little sister there.

03:45:21.040 --> 03:45:23.040
The shortest of one out of ten.

03:45:23.040 --> 03:45:24.040
Right.

03:45:24.040 --> 03:45:25.040
Okay.

03:45:25.040 --> 03:45:29.040
So as you see on the screen, ranking by views, it says one out of ten.

03:45:29.040 --> 03:45:35.040
That means in my last ten uploads of whatever content, this has ranked the highest in like

03:45:35.040 --> 03:45:38.040
most generated views in the time span.

03:45:38.040 --> 03:45:39.040
Okay.

03:45:39.040 --> 03:45:40.040
So it's a one out of ten.

03:45:40.040 --> 03:45:41.040
This is a really big thing.

03:45:41.040 --> 03:45:42.040
Okay.

03:45:42.040 --> 03:45:43.040
It means, hey, hold on a minute.

03:45:43.040 --> 03:45:50.040
This is doing really well in comparison to previous uploads type thing.

03:45:50.040 --> 03:45:58.040
So and then it says, so you see how that green dot is that green arrow on views is up.

03:45:58.040 --> 03:46:00.040
That means again, I've gained more views.

03:46:00.040 --> 03:46:01.040
Ten noon.

03:46:01.040 --> 03:46:02.040
Noon.

03:46:02.040 --> 03:46:04.040
I can't ramble for three hours.

03:46:04.040 --> 03:46:07.040
I need to save my voice because I'm recording pregnancy.

03:46:07.040 --> 03:46:11.040
It's so hard tonight and all my collabs are missed out on.

03:46:11.040 --> 03:46:13.040
So I can.

03:46:13.040 --> 03:46:14.040
But yeah.

03:46:14.040 --> 03:46:22.040
Well, number go up.

03:46:22.040 --> 03:46:25.040
I don't know about the Willy but the cake is massive.

03:46:25.040 --> 03:46:26.040
Okay.

03:46:26.040 --> 03:46:40.040
But yeah, it did well.

03:46:40.040 --> 03:46:42.040
Thank you for everyone who interacted with that short.

03:46:42.040 --> 03:46:50.040
I'm just checking the comments and someone's like, how much does your agency take?

03:46:50.040 --> 03:46:55.040
How much does the agency take from me?

03:46:55.040 --> 03:47:03.040
And even if I was a talent, it's 80, 20 and next year goes to 85, 15.

03:47:03.040 --> 03:47:07.040
So the company see this.

03:47:07.040 --> 03:47:10.040
The company see this.

03:47:10.040 --> 03:47:13.040
It's so hyper.

03:47:13.040 --> 03:47:14.040
Sorry.

03:47:14.040 --> 03:47:16.040
I'm sure you're sick of me.

03:47:16.040 --> 03:47:18.040
I'll put my background music on.

03:47:18.040 --> 03:47:19.040
But yeah.

03:47:19.040 --> 03:47:20.040
Thank you everyone who interacted with that short.

03:47:20.040 --> 03:47:23.040
You're super kill and awesome.

03:47:23.040 --> 03:47:27.040
And thank you for looking into my finances for me.

03:47:27.040 --> 03:47:31.040
Thank you for looking into the gen two finances.

03:47:31.040 --> 03:47:32.040
What?

03:47:32.040 --> 03:47:33.040
Who said that?

03:47:33.040 --> 03:47:34.040
What?

03:47:34.040 --> 03:47:40.040
No, but really 12 cases massive for the first month for a beginning agency.

03:47:40.040 --> 03:47:41.040
Yeah.

03:47:41.040 --> 03:47:46.040
I am very lucky.

03:47:46.040 --> 03:47:48.040
Just like how everything worked out.

03:47:48.040 --> 03:47:52.040
Like obviously when I was brewing the girls in my womb, I was like, oh my God.

03:47:52.040 --> 03:47:53.040
Am I making a mistake?

03:47:53.040 --> 03:47:55.040
Like is this insane?

03:47:55.040 --> 03:47:56.040
No motherfucker.

03:47:56.040 --> 03:47:58.040
This ain't insane.

03:47:58.040 --> 03:48:01.040
This is my calling motherfucker.

03:48:01.040 --> 03:48:02.040
I have daughters.

03:48:02.040 --> 03:48:06.040
I get to support and they get to achieve their dreams of being content creators.

03:48:06.040 --> 03:48:08.040
This is my calling in life.

03:48:08.040 --> 03:48:13.040
Just give me what should we do karaoke?

03:48:13.040 --> 03:48:15.040
I'm being so for real right now.

03:48:15.040 --> 03:48:18.040
Should we do pop up karaoke?

03:48:18.040 --> 03:48:21.040
Hold on.

03:48:21.040 --> 03:48:22.040
Hold on.

03:48:22.040 --> 03:48:25.040
We could essentially do pop up karaoke for like two hours.

03:48:25.040 --> 03:48:27.040
And then we can redirect into mercy.

03:48:27.040 --> 03:48:29.040
I think we could.

03:48:29.040 --> 03:48:31.040
I think we could.

03:48:31.040 --> 03:48:32.040
Oh.

03:48:32.040 --> 03:48:33.040
Oh no.

03:48:33.040 --> 03:48:35.040
I have to save my voice.

03:48:35.040 --> 03:48:36.040
No.

03:48:36.040 --> 03:48:37.040
I forgot.

03:48:37.040 --> 03:48:39.040
I need to do ASMR.

03:48:39.040 --> 03:48:40.040
No.

03:48:40.040 --> 03:48:42.040
I need to record ASMR.

03:48:42.040 --> 03:48:43.040
Okay.

03:48:43.040 --> 03:48:44.040
Wait.

03:48:44.040 --> 03:48:45.040
Wait.

03:48:45.040 --> 03:48:47.040
We'll do another pop up in another day.

03:48:47.040 --> 03:48:48.040
I need to do ASMR.

03:48:48.040 --> 03:48:49.040
I forgot.

03:48:49.040 --> 03:48:53.040
I have so many people waiting for me to record ASMR to upload my collapse.

03:48:53.040 --> 03:48:54.040
I'm so sorry.

03:48:54.040 --> 03:48:55.040
I can't sing.

03:48:55.040 --> 03:48:57.040
I'm so sorry to get excited.

03:48:57.040 --> 03:48:58.040
Get you excited.

03:48:58.040 --> 03:48:59.040
I'm done.

03:48:59.040 --> 03:49:00.040
Please forgive me.

03:49:00.040 --> 03:49:01.040
Right.

03:49:01.040 --> 03:49:04.040
Let me open up my marshmallow.

03:49:04.040 --> 03:49:10.040
Don't you have that kind of stream layer in the week?

03:49:10.040 --> 03:49:11.040
Yeah.

03:49:11.040 --> 03:49:13.040
But I like doing lots of streams.

03:49:13.040 --> 03:49:14.040
I'm never offline.

03:49:14.040 --> 03:49:15.040
That's right.

03:49:15.040 --> 03:49:17.040
That's why I make the big bucks.

03:49:17.040 --> 03:49:19.040
Because I'm never offline.

03:49:19.040 --> 03:49:20.040
Wow.

03:49:20.040 --> 03:49:29.040
If you want to save money for the girls, you could link your accounts together with the

03:49:29.040 --> 03:49:30.040
Steam Family feature.

03:49:30.040 --> 03:49:31.040
Yes.

03:49:31.040 --> 03:49:34.040
The girls have full permission to do that with their previous accounts.

03:49:34.040 --> 03:49:38.040
And they get to keep their Steam accounts at the end of their...

03:49:38.040 --> 03:49:40.040
I don't know when they want to depart.

03:49:40.040 --> 03:49:41.040
I don't keep it.

03:49:41.040 --> 03:49:42.040
That's their money.

03:49:42.040 --> 03:49:46.040
I absolutely do not touch any of that because they spent their money on it.

03:49:46.040 --> 03:49:47.040
So they own it.

03:49:47.040 --> 03:49:48.040
Crazy.

03:49:48.040 --> 03:49:49.040
Hi, Duan.

03:49:49.040 --> 03:49:50.040
Hi, Leiflin.

03:49:50.040 --> 03:49:55.040
I watched some of you a little to the left stream.

03:49:55.040 --> 03:49:56.040
What do you...

03:49:56.040 --> 03:50:03.040
And I may have misheard you, but it sounded like you're not doing too well.

03:50:03.040 --> 03:50:04.040
Oh, no.

03:50:04.040 --> 03:50:05.040
Sorry.

03:50:05.040 --> 03:50:07.040
My dad has gone home.

03:50:07.040 --> 03:50:09.040
When I said I'm depressive, espresso.

03:50:09.040 --> 03:50:11.040
What I meant is my dad's gone home.

03:50:11.040 --> 03:50:15.040
So I'm sad, but I'm happy because I get to hang out with you.

03:50:15.040 --> 03:50:17.040
You know, it cancels out the sadness.

03:50:17.040 --> 03:50:21.040
As soon as I click end broadcast, it's fucking over for me.

03:50:21.040 --> 03:50:22.040
That's all I'm saying.

03:50:22.040 --> 03:50:23.040
I'm going to go cry in the bath.

03:50:23.040 --> 03:50:24.040
I'm not even kidding.

03:50:24.040 --> 03:50:25.040
I'm going to go cry in the bath.

03:50:25.040 --> 03:50:30.040
I'm going to fully shave because I'm so fucking hairy.

03:50:30.040 --> 03:50:31.040
Anonymous, Johnny.

03:50:31.040 --> 03:50:33.040
Get us worked up then leaving us hanging.

03:50:33.040 --> 03:50:34.040
That's cruel.

03:50:34.040 --> 03:50:35.040
I'm so sorry.

03:50:35.040 --> 03:50:36.040
I didn't mean it, Leiflin.

03:50:36.040 --> 03:50:39.040
I got distracted.

03:50:39.040 --> 03:50:42.040
My dad went home, so I'm sad.

03:50:43.040 --> 03:50:46.040
Yeah, crying will record in the ASMR.

03:50:46.040 --> 03:50:50.040
Honestly, though, we could always have Twitter spaces.

03:50:50.040 --> 03:50:53.040
I'm going to say something so controversial.

03:50:53.040 --> 03:50:54.040
I don't like Twitter.

03:50:54.040 --> 03:50:58.040
I like putting my projects on Twitter being like, hey, I'm recording pregnancy ASMR.

03:50:58.040 --> 03:50:59.040
Here's a picture.

03:50:59.040 --> 03:51:01.040
Hey, I'm doing this with someone here.

03:51:01.040 --> 03:51:02.040
Here's a picture.

03:51:02.040 --> 03:51:11.040
I don't actually like the concept of Twitter and being like, hi, I'm in the bath, shaving

03:51:11.040 --> 03:51:13.040
my hairy minge.

03:51:13.040 --> 03:51:15.040
What am I supposed to tweet?

03:51:15.040 --> 03:51:17.040
I don't get it.

03:51:17.040 --> 03:51:20.040
In another life, I was basically forced to tweet every day and I was like, oh, I don't

03:51:20.040 --> 03:51:21.040
like it.

03:51:21.040 --> 03:51:22.040
I don't like it.

03:51:22.040 --> 03:51:23.040
Please quit me right now.

03:51:23.040 --> 03:51:24.040
You know?

03:51:24.040 --> 03:51:25.040
Be happy.

03:51:25.040 --> 03:51:26.040
Be happy.

03:51:26.040 --> 03:51:27.040
Be happy.

03:51:27.040 --> 03:51:28.040
Thank you, Kairon.

03:51:28.040 --> 03:51:29.040
It's like TMI.

03:51:29.040 --> 03:51:31.040
It's just no for me.

03:51:31.040 --> 03:51:32.040
Oh my gosh.

03:51:32.040 --> 03:51:38.040
Is that the Fibonacci sequence card from the hit video game, Baltro?

03:51:38.040 --> 03:51:42.040
Thank you for the five gifted memberships math, 16, 18.

03:51:42.040 --> 03:51:46.040
And congrats to those who caught it without this.

03:51:46.040 --> 03:51:47.040
No, don't shave.

03:51:47.040 --> 03:51:48.040
No, don't shave.

03:51:48.040 --> 03:51:51.040
You're so pretty.

03:51:51.040 --> 03:51:57.040
You're so pretty when I can't see the forest for the trees.

03:51:57.040 --> 03:51:59.040
Twitter spaces are great.

03:51:59.040 --> 03:52:01.040
The brain world is already here.

03:52:01.040 --> 03:52:03.040
It's back, baby.

03:52:03.040 --> 03:52:07.040
Hydration chip.

03:52:07.040 --> 03:52:08.040
Okay.

03:52:08.040 --> 03:52:10.040
I'll finish reading that, Maro.

03:52:10.040 --> 03:52:11.040
But I'm sorry.

03:52:11.040 --> 03:52:12.040
No, don't worry.

03:52:12.040 --> 03:52:13.040
I promise.

03:52:13.040 --> 03:52:15.040
Hopefully you know all the reeflings here about you and wish nothing but the best.

03:52:15.040 --> 03:52:17.040
Yes, I'm so sorry to confuse you, reefling.

03:52:17.040 --> 03:52:18.040
Please don't worry about me.

03:52:18.040 --> 03:52:22.040
When I said I'm upset, it's because my dad's gone home.

03:52:22.040 --> 03:52:23.040
And I love my dad very much.

03:52:23.040 --> 03:52:24.040
And he's a hoot and a holler.

03:52:24.040 --> 03:52:26.040
And it's very nice to have him around.

03:52:26.040 --> 03:52:32.040
But the next time I'll see him is probably in like two years time, which was a bit rough.

03:52:32.040 --> 03:52:34.040
It was like, ah, shit.

03:52:34.040 --> 03:52:36.040
That's a rough name.

03:52:36.040 --> 03:52:44.040
He said he doesn't think he can come on the plane next year to come see me, to come visit me.

03:52:44.040 --> 03:52:47.040
And now he would come visit me if I asked.

03:52:47.040 --> 03:52:57.040
If I said quit your fucking job right now and come over for like three months, then he would 100% do it.

03:52:57.040 --> 03:52:58.040
So please don't worry.

03:52:58.040 --> 03:52:59.040
It's not like that.

03:52:59.040 --> 03:53:03.040
It's just it's most likely two years.

03:53:03.040 --> 03:53:07.040
Like I showed my dad everything, like what I do work wise on that.

03:53:07.040 --> 03:53:09.040
And he said hi to AC.

03:53:09.040 --> 03:53:12.040
I don't know if I said it in the other stream, but don't worry if you weren't there.

03:53:12.040 --> 03:53:13.040
He said hi to AC.

03:53:13.040 --> 03:53:14.040
I was invoiced that way.

03:53:14.040 --> 03:53:16.040
He could through just hanging out.

03:53:16.040 --> 03:53:19.040
And I was like, oh, I was like, oh, dad, dad, dad, dad.

03:53:19.040 --> 03:53:20.040
This is AC.

03:53:20.040 --> 03:53:21.040
Say Privyat.

03:53:21.040 --> 03:53:22.040
And he was like, what?

03:53:22.040 --> 03:53:24.040
I was like, yeah, Privyat.

03:53:24.040 --> 03:53:25.040
It means hello in Russian.

03:53:25.040 --> 03:53:26.040
Go Privyat.

03:53:26.040 --> 03:53:28.040
And he was like, Privyat.

03:53:28.040 --> 03:53:30.040
And AC couldn't hear it sadly.

03:53:30.040 --> 03:53:32.040
But we were having a goof over.

03:53:32.040 --> 03:53:33.040
I was showing him my work.

03:53:33.040 --> 03:53:36.040
I was like, so this is what I do for the girls and all of that.

03:53:36.040 --> 03:53:38.040
And he was like 20%.

03:53:38.040 --> 03:53:40.040
And I'm like, yep, 20%.

03:53:40.040 --> 03:53:41.040
I don't want to be greed.

03:53:41.040 --> 03:53:42.040
I'm anti-greed.

03:53:42.040 --> 03:53:44.040
And he's like, yep, yep.

03:53:44.040 --> 03:53:45.040
That sounds right.

03:53:45.040 --> 03:53:47.040
That sounds about you, Johnny.

03:53:47.040 --> 03:53:49.040
Did AC call him dad?

03:53:49.040 --> 03:53:50.040
Don't.

03:53:50.040 --> 03:53:51.040
No.

03:53:51.040 --> 03:53:52.040
Don't.

03:53:52.040 --> 03:53:53.040
Don't.

03:53:53.040 --> 03:53:54.040
You're done.

03:53:54.040 --> 03:53:55.040
You're done.

03:53:55.040 --> 03:53:57.040
I'm farting on your eyelashes.

03:53:57.040 --> 03:53:59.040
Open up your eyeballs right now.

03:53:59.040 --> 03:54:01.040
Don't ever say that again.

03:54:01.040 --> 03:54:03.040
Hi, Johnny.

03:54:03.040 --> 03:54:05.040
Serious answer here.

03:54:05.040 --> 03:54:06.040
OK.

03:54:06.040 --> 03:54:07.040
Emmy and Laura is ginger.

03:54:07.040 --> 03:54:09.040
But in her VTuber model, it's definitely more blonde.

03:54:09.040 --> 03:54:11.040
And tell her she's ed in.

03:54:11.040 --> 03:54:13.040
She is ed in her model, actually.

03:54:13.040 --> 03:54:15.040
She is alternate in...

03:54:15.040 --> 03:54:17.040
Emmy is so fantastic to work with.

03:54:17.040 --> 03:54:18.040
Oh my God.

03:54:18.040 --> 03:54:20.040
We like came to an agreement.

03:54:20.040 --> 03:54:22.040
She's like, I think you guys have seen it.

03:54:22.040 --> 03:54:24.040
So I'm allowed to talk about it.

03:54:24.040 --> 03:54:26.040
And if she doesn't want me to talk about it.

03:54:26.040 --> 03:54:27.040
Sorry, Emmy.

03:54:27.040 --> 03:54:28.040
I love you.

03:54:28.040 --> 03:54:31.040
I'll pay you 50 bucks to not be mad at me.

03:54:31.040 --> 03:54:33.040
Emmy...

03:54:33.040 --> 03:54:36.040
So Emmy's designed her 2.0.

03:54:36.040 --> 03:54:38.040
But I had to say to her.

03:54:38.040 --> 03:54:40.040
I love your 2.0.

03:54:40.040 --> 03:54:44.040
But you need to let Emmy 1.0 be a thing for a little bit longer.

03:54:44.040 --> 03:54:48.040
So we came to an agreement that she's going to get fixed up a little bit

03:54:48.040 --> 03:54:50.040
to Emmy's image, which I'm 100% OK with.

03:54:50.040 --> 03:54:53.040
Like, as I said, I want the girls to be happy with who they are.

03:54:53.040 --> 03:54:56.040
Because at the end of the day, they've been given models, OK?

03:54:56.040 --> 03:54:58.040
Like, Shebe, she's already told you.

03:54:58.040 --> 03:55:03.040
Shebe's getting a more reflective version of herself on a model.

03:55:03.040 --> 03:55:05.040
That's coming out soon to you.

03:55:05.040 --> 03:55:06.040
I don't know when.

03:55:06.040 --> 03:55:07.040
Nari's cooking.

03:55:07.040 --> 03:55:09.040
Nari's cooking very hard right now.

03:55:09.040 --> 03:55:12.040
She's a very busy modeler.

03:55:12.040 --> 03:55:15.040
So please do have patience, but yes.

03:55:15.040 --> 03:55:17.040
It's a 1.5 model.

03:55:17.040 --> 03:55:18.040
She showed it on stream.

03:55:18.040 --> 03:55:20.040
Yes, as I said, I'm Emmy, not Emily.

03:55:20.040 --> 03:55:22.040
Did I say Emily?

03:55:23.040 --> 03:55:25.040
Wait, why are you guys saying Emily?

03:55:25.040 --> 03:55:27.040
Did I say Emily?

03:55:27.040 --> 03:55:28.040
I did.

03:55:28.040 --> 03:55:32.040
It must have started because in a mashed words together, you didn't.

03:55:32.040 --> 03:55:34.040
OK, Emmy, Emmy, Emmy.

03:55:34.040 --> 03:55:37.040
Emmy, Emmy, yeah, Emmy, yeah, Emmy, yeah.

03:55:37.040 --> 03:55:38.040
Drank.

03:55:38.040 --> 03:55:39.040
Swalalala.

03:55:39.040 --> 03:55:40.040
Drank.

03:55:40.040 --> 03:55:41.040
Swalalala.

03:55:41.040 --> 03:55:45.040
But yes, as I said, I'm happy for the girls to, you know,

03:55:45.040 --> 03:55:48.040
change things up and look the way they want.

03:55:48.040 --> 03:55:53.040
But I do need her to still be very close to the original design,

03:55:53.040 --> 03:55:55.040
and she was so good to work with.

03:55:55.040 --> 03:55:59.040
Like I was passing on messages from the concept artists to each other

03:55:59.040 --> 03:56:02.040
and being like, OK, you can do this, but don't do this,

03:56:02.040 --> 03:56:05.040
because you need this and don't do that, because you need that.

03:56:05.040 --> 03:56:07.040
And she was so good.

03:56:07.040 --> 03:56:10.040
She was also so good to work on, so 10 out of 10.

03:56:10.040 --> 03:56:12.040
Work with, sorry, on an objective.

03:56:12.040 --> 03:56:14.040
On an objective.

03:56:14.040 --> 03:56:17.040
And he looked, fuck, I'm dying.

03:56:17.040 --> 03:56:19.040
Sorry, I just choked on my spit.

03:56:19.040 --> 03:56:23.040
I'm trying to like talk and breathe and like swallow my spit at the same time,

03:56:23.040 --> 03:56:27.040
because I'm so excited to get the next question out, OK?

03:56:27.040 --> 03:56:29.040
He found a good bunch of daughters.

03:56:29.040 --> 03:56:31.040
Bro, they found me.

03:56:31.040 --> 03:56:34.040
I don't know how on earth they were crazy enough to go for it.

03:56:34.040 --> 03:56:36.040
Bro, crazy.

03:56:36.040 --> 03:56:37.040
But they did it.

03:56:37.040 --> 03:56:38.040
And here we are.

03:56:38.040 --> 03:56:39.040
I mean, fuck, here we are.

03:56:39.040 --> 03:56:43.040
We're almost at like all of us are 10,000T subs.

03:56:43.040 --> 03:56:46.040
I'm so excited to release that motherfucking artwork.

03:56:46.040 --> 03:56:47.040
Oh, my God.

03:56:47.040 --> 03:56:49.040
Oh, my God, AC is almost 8K.

03:56:49.040 --> 03:56:52.040
Oh, my God, I'm humping to death.

03:56:52.040 --> 03:56:53.040
Hmm.

03:56:53.040 --> 03:56:54.040
Wow.

03:56:54.040 --> 03:56:59.040
And AC and Emmy have a collab coming out soon on AC's channel.

03:56:59.040 --> 03:57:04.040
Sometimes when you get me bricked off, it doesn't go down for an hour.

03:57:04.040 --> 03:57:08.040
Oh, no, four hours is dangerous.

03:57:08.040 --> 03:57:10.040
Are you based on strong heim?

03:57:10.040 --> 03:57:11.040
Strongest strong heim.

03:57:11.040 --> 03:57:12.040
Sounds a bit familiar.

03:57:12.040 --> 03:57:19.040
Oh, I am based after strontium, which is my dad's gamer tag, not the actual gamer tag

03:57:19.040 --> 03:57:22.040
before you look up and be like, I find her dad relax.

03:57:22.040 --> 03:57:24.040
It's not the actual gamer tag.

03:57:24.040 --> 03:57:32.040
But unbelievably, actually, so we are debuts got clipped on this channel called smoothie

03:57:32.040 --> 03:57:38.040
and someone replied under my comment and they were like, are you after strontium dog?

03:57:38.040 --> 03:57:42.040
So this is the even more hidden lore behind my name.

03:57:42.040 --> 03:57:46.040
So strontium dog is a comic my dad used to read.

03:57:46.040 --> 03:57:50.040
And then he made his gamer tag like strontium.

03:57:50.040 --> 03:57:52.040
It's not exactly strontium, so relax.

03:57:52.040 --> 03:57:54.040
And then I called myself strontium.

03:57:54.040 --> 03:57:58.040
And someone commented under and said, are you after strontium dog?

03:57:58.040 --> 03:58:01.040
And I'm like, yes, what the eff.

03:58:01.040 --> 03:58:05.040
The fact even you what strontium dog was was insane.

03:58:05.040 --> 03:58:08.040
It was literally gone full circle.

03:58:08.040 --> 03:58:09.040
Full circle.

03:58:09.040 --> 03:58:10.040
Okay.

03:58:10.040 --> 03:58:13.040
Throw that ass in a full circle.

03:58:13.040 --> 03:58:16.040
And sorry, I'm super hyper today.

03:58:16.040 --> 03:58:18.040
I fucking might be so much worse ones.

03:58:18.040 --> 03:58:23.040
It's so nice to just not feel like stress.

03:58:23.040 --> 03:58:24.040
Now, I love my dad.

03:58:24.040 --> 03:58:25.040
Love me dad.

03:58:25.040 --> 03:58:26.040
Love me refund.

03:58:26.040 --> 03:58:27.040
Simple.

03:58:27.040 --> 03:58:34.040
I felt like I was juggling a lot like normally a nap after streaming all of that.

03:58:34.040 --> 03:58:37.040
And all of that jazz.

03:58:37.040 --> 03:58:40.040
I'm almost caught up with the Elden Ring streams.

03:58:40.040 --> 03:58:42.040
They start up in like two weeks again.

03:58:42.040 --> 03:58:43.040
So I hope you're all Elden.

03:58:43.040 --> 03:58:46.040
I hope you've got like your Elden Ring barfool.

03:58:46.040 --> 03:58:48.040
Can't wait for your dad to be announced in gen two.

03:58:48.040 --> 03:58:50.040
Oh my God.

03:58:50.040 --> 03:58:52.040
That would be hilarious.

03:58:52.040 --> 03:58:55.040
Hi guys, strontium here.

03:58:55.040 --> 03:58:59.040
I would play the clip that I recorded with him, but he said my legal name in it.

03:58:59.040 --> 03:59:02.040
I was like, I was like, I would just record in it so you can see what you want.

03:59:02.040 --> 03:59:04.040
So instantly goes legal name.

03:59:04.040 --> 03:59:09.040
And I'm like, okay, well, I'll need to edit that before I send it on to the editors.

03:59:09.040 --> 03:59:12.040
And strontium's dad is going to be the best girl.

03:59:12.040 --> 03:59:13.040
Oh my God.

03:59:13.040 --> 03:59:17.040
The only male allowed on stream for real for real.

03:59:17.040 --> 03:59:19.040
I managed to catch up to Elden Ring so he can help you out.

03:59:19.040 --> 03:59:20.040
Oh yeah.

03:59:20.040 --> 03:59:22.040
Go kiss me on your lips.

03:59:22.040 --> 03:59:25.040
I'm going to help me in the flower field.

03:59:25.040 --> 03:59:27.040
Sensor the name.

03:59:27.040 --> 03:59:28.040
Bro, honestly.

03:59:28.040 --> 03:59:31.040
We need a model for strontium's dad if he ever comes on a stream.

03:59:32.040 --> 03:59:37.040
So we recorded a short of him guessing VTuber names.

03:59:37.040 --> 03:59:44.040
And I said to him, if it goes viral, you realize you're going to have to get shipped out again so we can record more.

03:59:50.040 --> 03:59:53.040
We would make him our Oshi.

03:59:53.040 --> 03:59:55.040
Strontium.

03:59:55.040 --> 03:59:57.040
The dad tubers, honestly.

03:59:57.040 --> 03:59:58.040
No, my immersion.

03:59:58.040 --> 04:00:00.040
That's my fucking dad.

04:00:00.040 --> 04:00:03.040
No, don't troll when it comes to that.

04:00:03.040 --> 04:00:05.040
I know idol culture, no male on stream.

04:00:05.040 --> 04:00:07.040
But if I'm like, yeah, my dad.

04:00:07.040 --> 04:00:09.040
That's my dad, okay?

04:00:09.040 --> 04:00:13.040
Then he started making me get raged.

04:00:13.040 --> 04:00:15.040
Then he made me enraged.

04:00:15.040 --> 04:00:17.040
Dad tuber, real.

04:00:17.040 --> 04:00:21.040
Since you're a cutfish, your dad model needs to be cracking.

04:00:21.040 --> 04:00:28.040
Well, I'm going to get a doodle of him drawn for the shorts because when he talks, obviously it was just me sitting there staring at the screen.

04:00:28.040 --> 04:00:31.040
But I need to like, who goes there?

04:00:31.040 --> 04:00:35.040
I need to cut up the audio and then I need to get an insane amount of assets.

04:00:35.040 --> 04:00:37.040
The short is going to cost so much money to get.

04:00:37.040 --> 04:00:40.040
I mean, Strontium's dad is already in my kami Oshi.

04:00:40.040 --> 04:00:42.040
You have a father.

04:00:42.040 --> 04:00:44.040
I thought you were a cutfish.

04:00:44.040 --> 04:00:46.040
Wait, cutfishes don't have dads.

04:00:46.040 --> 04:00:49.040
Cutfishes don't have dads.

04:00:49.040 --> 04:00:52.040
Are you getting me to type something into Google that makes no sense?

04:00:53.040 --> 04:00:54.040
No.

04:00:54.040 --> 04:00:56.040
First question that comes up.

04:00:56.040 --> 04:00:58.040
Can you keep a cutfish as a pet?

04:00:58.040 --> 04:00:59.040
Oh, whoa.

04:00:59.040 --> 04:01:01.040
Can you keep a cutfish as a pet?

04:01:01.040 --> 04:01:02.040
No, they're too smart.

04:01:02.040 --> 04:01:03.040
Don't do it.

04:01:03.040 --> 04:01:06.040
Wait, does that mean he would get a Patreon as a...

04:01:06.040 --> 04:01:07.040
Stop!

04:01:07.040 --> 04:01:08.040
Stop.

04:01:08.040 --> 04:01:12.040
They definitely do have male progenitors.

04:01:12.040 --> 04:01:15.040
Some people are that parasocial.

04:01:15.040 --> 04:01:20.040
I bloody hope not when my fucking dad were...

04:01:20.040 --> 04:01:26.040
I'm going to start fighting hands with the shadow people again.

04:01:26.040 --> 04:01:30.040
It's been a day since my dad's gone and I'm already throwing hands with the shadow people.

04:01:30.040 --> 04:01:32.040
Actually, you know what's really disgusting?

04:01:32.040 --> 04:01:36.040
I've instantly stopped taking showers every morning and I know that he's gone.

04:01:36.040 --> 04:01:38.040
Like, absolute minger.

04:01:38.040 --> 04:01:40.040
Absolute minger.

04:01:40.040 --> 04:01:41.040
Hi, Strontium.

04:01:41.040 --> 04:01:43.040
Don't want to make you cry earlier or anything.

04:01:43.040 --> 04:01:44.040
Don't worry.

04:01:44.040 --> 04:01:46.040
It's reserved for the bath time.

04:01:46.040 --> 04:01:48.040
But you're a wonderful goober and we'll never get sick of it.

04:01:48.040 --> 04:01:49.040
If you're ever sad, we're here for you.

04:01:49.040 --> 04:01:50.040
If you ever need help, we're here for you.

04:01:50.040 --> 04:01:53.040
If you're ever raging hard, we're here to get our worded by you.

04:01:53.040 --> 04:01:54.040
Strontium, love maxing.

04:01:54.040 --> 04:01:56.040
We fling, love maxing.

04:01:56.040 --> 04:02:01.040
Get kissed, get kissed, get kissed.

04:02:01.040 --> 04:02:06.040
I just forced my tongue in your mouth when I go...

04:02:06.040 --> 04:02:08.040
Honestly, that's terrible.

04:02:08.040 --> 04:02:10.040
Let's see if that turns out okay.

04:02:10.040 --> 04:02:12.040
Dude, Papa Cuttle's leave as a message.

04:02:12.040 --> 04:02:15.040
Yes, he did, but I can't read it or I'm going to burst out crying.

04:02:15.040 --> 04:02:19.040
I need to give it a few days before I be there.

04:02:19.040 --> 04:02:25.040
But the TLDR is thanks for looking after my daughter whilst I couldn't.

04:02:25.040 --> 04:02:30.040
And that's all I'm going to say before I start crying.

04:02:30.040 --> 04:02:31.040
Hi, Strontium.

04:02:31.040 --> 04:02:32.040
Hi, Bethling.

04:02:32.040 --> 04:02:34.040
You and the rest of the girls are really inspiring.

04:02:34.040 --> 04:02:38.040
Oh, yeah, you're inspired by the autism of your honor.

04:02:38.040 --> 04:02:39.040
Thank you very much.

04:02:39.040 --> 04:02:41.040
I wanted to be a content creator too.

04:02:41.040 --> 04:02:42.040
Oh, yeah.

04:02:42.040 --> 04:02:43.040
Come aboard.

04:02:43.040 --> 04:02:44.040
Clam aboard.

04:02:44.040 --> 04:02:47.040
Oh, no, I doubt I'll ever do an interesting audio.

04:02:47.040 --> 04:02:48.040
Oh my god.

04:02:48.040 --> 04:02:49.040
Shock and behavior.

04:02:49.040 --> 04:02:50.040
I can't believe it.

04:02:50.040 --> 04:02:52.040
You don't want to moan into the microphone.

04:02:52.040 --> 04:02:54.040
But I was way too afraid or too busy.

04:02:54.040 --> 04:02:56.040
But after seeing you guys have so much fun.

04:02:56.040 --> 04:02:58.040
I want to do it too today.

04:02:58.040 --> 04:03:00.040
I've been making original songs.

04:03:00.040 --> 04:03:03.040
Oh my god, you can make the cat songs from...

04:03:03.040 --> 04:03:07.040
You should play straight and then give the music man these music sheets

04:03:07.040 --> 04:03:09.040
and then make songs off the top of your head.

04:03:09.040 --> 04:03:12.040
I find it crazy that Carl Fish is motivating me

04:03:12.040 --> 04:03:14.040
to get back to what I did this.

04:03:14.040 --> 04:03:15.040
Thanks for pumping me up.

04:03:15.040 --> 04:03:16.040
You got to know.

04:03:16.040 --> 04:03:17.040
Pump it up.

04:03:17.040 --> 04:03:19.040
We got to pump it up.

04:03:19.040 --> 04:03:20.040
We got to know.

04:03:20.040 --> 04:03:22.040
Now let me pump your clam with my ink.

04:03:22.040 --> 04:03:23.040
Okay.

04:03:23.040 --> 04:03:24.040
You're done.

04:03:24.040 --> 04:03:25.040
You're done.

04:03:25.040 --> 04:03:26.040
You're done, though.

04:03:26.040 --> 04:03:27.040
Done.

04:03:27.040 --> 04:03:29.040
Well, if you can write diss tracks, let me know.

04:03:29.040 --> 04:03:31.040
Because I want the girls to do diss tracks on each other.

04:03:31.040 --> 04:03:33.040
I think that's the funniest thing ever.

04:03:33.040 --> 04:03:34.040
Oh, strongy cuddles.

04:03:34.040 --> 04:03:36.040
More like strongy fumbles the bag.

04:03:36.040 --> 04:03:38.040
Because what's with that 80-20 cut?

04:03:38.040 --> 04:03:41.040
You literally are not going to get a yacht at that rate.

04:03:41.040 --> 04:03:42.040
Whoa.

04:03:44.040 --> 04:03:46.040
I can go straight, honestly.

04:03:46.040 --> 04:03:47.040
That's what I need.

04:03:47.040 --> 04:03:49.040
I so badly want diss tracks.

04:03:49.040 --> 04:03:50.040
I want to, like, diss track.

04:03:50.040 --> 04:03:53.040
Be a little bit more, like, feel the whores.

04:03:54.040 --> 04:03:55.040
Stop.

04:03:55.040 --> 04:03:56.040
Stop.

04:03:56.040 --> 04:03:57.040
That's not funny.

04:03:57.040 --> 04:03:58.040
Stop.

04:03:58.040 --> 04:03:59.040
Stop.

04:03:59.040 --> 04:04:00.040
Hi, strongy.

04:04:00.040 --> 04:04:01.040
Hi, refling.

04:04:01.040 --> 04:04:02.040
I love you so much.

04:04:02.040 --> 04:04:03.040
I love you so much.

04:04:03.040 --> 04:04:04.040
Sorry.

04:04:04.040 --> 04:04:05.040
I'm getting so excited.

04:04:05.040 --> 04:04:06.040
I'm at 10.

04:04:06.040 --> 04:04:08.040
I need to turn it down to a 7.

04:04:08.040 --> 04:04:09.040
Okay.

04:04:09.040 --> 04:04:11.040
I need to turn it down to a 7.

04:04:14.040 --> 04:04:15.040
Hi, strongy.

04:04:15.040 --> 04:04:16.040
Hi, refling.

04:04:16.040 --> 04:04:17.040
I don't mind if you don't shit.

04:04:17.040 --> 04:04:18.040
Replay.

04:04:18.040 --> 04:04:20.040
Also, don't shower so I can taste you.

04:04:20.040 --> 04:04:21.040
Replay.

04:04:21.040 --> 04:04:24.040
Napoleon Bonaparte back from the grave.

04:04:24.040 --> 04:04:25.040
Jeez.

04:04:25.040 --> 04:04:27.040
I'll rip your bones apart.

04:04:27.040 --> 04:04:28.040
Bonaparte.

04:04:28.040 --> 04:04:30.040
Turn your horse into glue.

04:04:30.040 --> 04:04:33.040
That is a reference to horses being turned into glue.

04:04:33.040 --> 04:04:35.040
That is an actual thing.

04:04:35.040 --> 04:04:36.040
Hi, strongy.

04:04:36.040 --> 04:04:37.040
Hi, refling.

04:04:37.040 --> 04:04:39.040
You know, I want you to get comforted.

04:04:39.040 --> 04:04:40.040
Get comforted.

04:04:40.040 --> 04:04:41.040
Get comforted.

04:04:41.040 --> 04:04:42.040
Pop, pop, pop, pop.

04:04:42.040 --> 04:04:43.040
Comfort, comfort, comfort.

04:04:43.040 --> 04:04:46.040
Will we ever get a horror game stream?

04:04:46.040 --> 04:04:47.040
Yeah.

04:04:47.040 --> 04:04:50.040
Technically, yes.

04:04:50.040 --> 04:04:53.040
I'm very scared of horror games.

04:04:53.040 --> 04:04:56.040
I scream in them and I have a heart rate monitor.

04:04:56.040 --> 04:04:58.040
So, yes.

04:04:58.040 --> 04:05:03.040
Eventually, it's probably going to be like a Donoth on reward because I get freaked out

04:05:03.040 --> 04:05:04.040
in video games.

04:05:04.040 --> 04:05:09.040
I get really good immersion when I play video games where I have tunnel vision and stuff.

04:05:09.040 --> 04:05:15.040
So, that makes the first person horror games 10 times scarier because I feel like they're

04:05:15.040 --> 04:05:18.040
going to touch my freaking back.

04:05:18.040 --> 04:05:22.040
FNAF 1 would absolutely make me shit myself.

04:05:22.040 --> 04:05:24.040
I'm not even kidding.

04:05:24.040 --> 04:05:27.040
The chair would be ruined.

04:05:27.040 --> 04:05:29.040
What was that person thinking?

04:05:29.040 --> 04:05:32.040
I bet if I melted that horse, I could stick things together.

04:05:32.040 --> 04:05:33.040
Can I teach you something?

04:05:33.040 --> 04:05:39.040
They most likely were cooking the horse and then they were like, oh, it went really sticky.

04:05:39.040 --> 04:05:40.040
That's weird.

04:05:40.040 --> 04:05:44.040
And then it did it to another horse and then it went sticky and then it went another horse

04:05:44.040 --> 04:05:47.040
and then it went sticky and then they realized they could make glue from it.

04:05:47.040 --> 04:05:49.040
It's kind of like the cow drinking thing.

04:05:49.040 --> 04:05:54.040
People were like, eh, he was the first human to figure out that cows get milk.

04:05:54.040 --> 04:05:57.040
Motherfucker, you were breastfed.

04:05:57.040 --> 04:05:59.040
Humans and mammals ain't that different.

04:05:59.040 --> 04:06:02.040
Well, actually, I'm going to shit your pants right now.

04:06:02.040 --> 04:06:04.040
Wait, no, I'm not going to shit your pants right now.

04:06:04.040 --> 04:06:07.040
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

04:06:07.040 --> 04:06:08.040
Wait, let me restart.

04:06:08.040 --> 04:06:10.040
Humans are mammals.

04:06:10.040 --> 04:06:13.040
Babies drink milk from boob.

04:06:13.040 --> 04:06:15.040
Boob is also on cow.

04:06:15.040 --> 04:06:17.040
Cow produces milk.

04:06:17.040 --> 04:06:21.040
It's not some weird thing where a random guy taught cow in a field and went, oh, let me get some of that.

04:06:21.040 --> 04:06:23.040
No, it was domestication of animals.

04:06:23.040 --> 04:06:25.040
No, I'm not shitting your pants.

04:06:25.040 --> 04:06:26.040
I'm sorry.

04:06:26.040 --> 04:06:27.040
I'm sorry.

04:06:27.040 --> 04:06:29.040
No, I didn't mean that.

04:06:29.040 --> 04:06:30.040
Shit your pants.

04:06:30.040 --> 04:06:32.040
NO!

04:06:32.040 --> 04:06:36.800
Honestly anonymous ain't no way my Aussie is interested in epic rap battles in history

04:06:36.800 --> 04:06:41.960
Are you kidding me? I love that stuff, although I definitely haven't watched the newest stuff at all

04:06:43.360 --> 04:06:45.520
Be gentle in your panty lin

04:06:46.200 --> 04:06:52.840
What is she cooking something devious clearly? I just want a fresh pair who's gonna clean them your problem not mine. Oh

04:06:55.080 --> 04:06:59.200
No, hold on I'm about to be proven wrong live on stream

04:07:00.360 --> 04:07:02.360
I

04:07:04.120 --> 04:07:07.600
Don't know I'm getting your reference sheets for the girls. Don't show me that

04:07:08.280 --> 04:07:14.400
Don't show me that right. I'll be fair. I've even sent me the reference sheets of the girls. I'm getting your ones for them

04:07:15.760 --> 04:07:21.440
If you want to save money, oh, I read that one. Oh my god. I'm out of our club. Hi. I'm new here to all this VTuber stuff

04:07:25.560 --> 04:07:29.320
All right, I was just making sure you weren't asking anything

04:07:29.320 --> 04:07:32.720
Okay, but I was hoping you could answer a few questions. I'm sorry if you answered them

04:07:32.720 --> 04:07:37.160
Oh, yeah, of course. I wondered if there's a place where you will post your karaoke streams

04:07:37.960 --> 04:07:42.680
I'll be working most likely when you miss it. Oh, I don't host it myself

04:07:44.560 --> 04:07:52.040
And normally archive annons do it all for me. Thank you archive annons. You are the secret hidden people of the good stuff

04:07:52.040 --> 04:07:54.040
Thank you. We appreciate you and

04:07:54.800 --> 04:08:00.240
Yes, hopefully you don't mind if I ask but how would we know if something like cat rocks is broken? Oh

04:08:02.200 --> 04:08:06.880
You just need to replace dot with the word dot and then I'll do the rest

04:08:07.480 --> 04:08:15.080
If you want to send it, I'll just say link archive annons are the seventh member of veal or literally they work in over time

04:08:15.080 --> 04:08:17.080
Their PCs are exploding

04:08:17.240 --> 04:08:24.040
And fucking there they're they start quaking when Azura has a fucking legal edge and streams

04:08:24.040 --> 04:08:27.360
They're little their knees are noblin. That's all I'm saying

04:08:27.360 --> 04:08:31.960
They're noblin and wobbling in their chair when they see you on the schedule that Azura's got legal edge and strings

04:08:32.480 --> 04:08:35.680
They're like no, my my fucking PC is gonna implode

04:08:36.600 --> 04:08:39.040
So far you only had one members carry

04:08:41.400 --> 04:08:43.400
Just a little

04:08:43.640 --> 04:08:48.080
I'll always be here for you and so will the roof and stop being so wholesome to me. How dare you?

04:08:48.880 --> 04:08:50.880
Stop being so

04:08:51.400 --> 04:08:55.320
Hi strongy, you are correct. I'm a is a hundred percent doing ginger. Thank you

04:08:56.200 --> 04:08:59.160
But you are wrong about Azura her hair is green

04:08:59.840 --> 04:09:01.840
It's similar to Hatsune Miku

04:09:02.560 --> 04:09:09.160
You're gonna shit your pants when you learn what color hats and Miku's hair is that's fucking blue. She's bloody blue

04:09:10.160 --> 04:09:16.800
You say cutfish candy be pits, but what about you? Oh, right? Okay. That was good. That was smooth. Okay. Let's do a let's do a

04:09:20.600 --> 04:09:25.360
I need a clap I need like a round of applause. I'll get round of applause, okay

04:09:27.080 --> 04:09:32.080
Back in the pants again when I learned she was a league player. I was like what but you're friendly

04:09:32.640 --> 04:09:36.840
But you're nice blue hair blue tie hiding in your Wi-Fi

04:09:37.600 --> 04:09:39.600
Open secret

04:09:41.680 --> 04:09:43.680
I'm thinking me

04:09:48.400 --> 04:09:53.280
Buzzer's hair is Prismarine. I've never seen that word in my life. Hey

04:09:55.040 --> 04:10:02.080
Marine I'm literally typing in piss marine right now. Is this a joke? Is it gonna be a willy? Oh my god, it's a minecraft block

04:10:02.080 --> 04:10:06.640
I'm so sorry. I don't play I have I have really limited knowledge on minecraft

04:10:08.480 --> 04:10:10.840
Prismarine is a minecraft block

04:10:12.560 --> 04:10:17.880
What is prismarine in real life prismarine is entirely entirely fictional

04:10:18.280 --> 04:10:23.480
However, it looks like aquamarine. Right. Okay an aqua blue meaning war

04:10:24.040 --> 04:10:29.120
That's right. Thank you. It's seafoam. I swear. I don't know is her concept

04:10:30.040 --> 04:10:31.560
I

04:10:31.560 --> 04:10:34.360
Forgot to send away her concept art. So I need to do that

04:10:38.680 --> 04:10:43.200
Hi strongy you mentioned you want to make a diss track for veiler. I just find them so goofy and fun

04:10:43.200 --> 04:10:49.360
Sorry, I do what the crazy is I was thinking that a while ago making your own version of your background music

04:10:49.360 --> 04:10:51.640
Be and then writing lyrics about the six you get on my head

04:10:52.640 --> 04:10:56.840
You silly cut fish I want to get in the studio right now pop pop pop get in the studio pop pop pop

04:10:57.080 --> 04:11:02.880
Hasimiko here is officially blue green. No, it's not. It's blue. She's blue

04:11:04.480 --> 04:11:09.640
All right, I'm about to head out. Good night. Racewell reeflings. Sorry. I keep yapping. I

04:11:10.320 --> 04:11:16.040
Need to go take a vocal rest and then I need to go edit or maybe I'll not and

04:11:16.480 --> 04:11:20.320
Then I'll edit and then I'll record pregnant with you

04:11:22.080 --> 04:11:24.080
But rest

04:11:25.400 --> 04:11:30.080
Hi, mommy. I heard you like epic rap battles, but generally you say your favorite minors

04:11:31.160 --> 04:11:36.240
Definitely Steve Jobs versus Bill Gates. I actually really like the Leonardo

04:11:37.520 --> 04:11:43.640
The Leonardo one the fucking Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles versus the Renaissance ones

04:11:44.200 --> 04:11:49.720
Because although I didn't realize they were named after Renaissance characters until I watched that epic rap battle

04:11:49.920 --> 04:11:54.240
Because I was like the orange again. I guess names of my curse my color something like that

04:11:56.040 --> 04:12:01.360
No, good night. Those who rest Ronnie good night, Ronnie. Wait, are you guys sending me off? What the fuck?

04:12:02.040 --> 04:12:05.000
No, I'm saying good night to that reef Lynn. Are you sending me off?

04:12:05.720 --> 04:12:07.720
Wait, am I a magical offline?

04:12:10.920 --> 04:12:17.240
I'm actually I'm not being sent off wait. I was saying good night to that reef Lynn. Did I not say it in a sentence structure?

04:12:18.240 --> 04:12:20.240

Yes, leave oh you're gonna put me in the bath so I can choose I'll do a shave in ASMR

04:12:29.200 --> 04:12:30.960

04:12:36.480 --> 04:12:38.240
But yeah, I'm not even kidding

Leave up in yard filled with fun filled with fun

04:12:42.240 --> 04:12:43.440
Oh

04:12:43.440 --> 04:12:47.480

I don't want to you leave. Are you is your strontium copium not gone higher?

04:14:13.360 --> 04:14:15.880
I think I got the uncensored version somewhere

04:14:16.720 --> 04:14:21.120
Starting leaving us after only four hours of yapping. Wait, do you want like a few minutes more?

04:14:21.720 --> 04:14:23.600

04:14:55.600 --> 04:15:00.360
Happening on it, so we're gonna test it in a member stream and then we're gonna do it as a public stream set, okay?

04:15:01.600 --> 04:15:03.600
10 minutes of yapping my favorite

04:15:04.160 --> 04:15:06.160

I'm gonna fart. I fart so badly

04:15:12.840 --> 04:15:15.040
Not gonna lie shaving ASMR might sound nice

04:15:16.280 --> 04:15:21.160
Shaving what my legs are you not gonna be satisfied until you hear?

04:15:22.000 --> 04:15:24.400
Mm-hmm the thing

04:15:26.640 --> 04:15:28.640
Stop being wholesome

04:15:29.440 --> 04:15:31.760
But it's hard when you're cute and came to reee

04:15:32.640 --> 04:15:41.000
We just want to pat you give you kid give you kisses and cuddle and put your prints until you drill and steady on steady on on the edge on the edge

04:15:41.840 --> 04:15:43.840

04:15:46.880 --> 04:15:48.880
Hi, Stony

04:15:55.640 --> 04:15:58.960
Underrated whichever for real Stony is so sex

04:16:02.760 --> 04:16:07.880
What is that Japanese mean where that guy's just screaming sex in the tunnel I feel that

04:16:11.880 --> 04:16:13.000

100% body shave ASMR ending on the clam that would take me so long to do like 20 minutes

04:16:19.120 --> 04:16:20.640
kind of reefed

04:16:20.640 --> 04:16:22.120
Takashi

04:16:22.120 --> 04:16:24.120
that he grew up

04:16:30.280 --> 04:16:33.680
Takashi chasing pedestrians and Takashi

04:16:35.480 --> 04:16:37.480
Kashi's our spirit on the wall

04:16:41.880 --> 04:16:43.880
Mmm

04:16:43.880 --> 04:16:47.800
Sex and goofy is the real combo breaker. No Takashi your body won't handle it

04:16:50.320 --> 04:16:56.240
Where he's on a bike I'm pretty sure he's on a bike in a tunnel and he's like sex out and it's like bouncing off the walls

04:16:58.560 --> 04:17:00.560
Peak male perform him

04:17:02.960 --> 04:17:10.320
Mummy I want you to know that about my first toy to fully enjoy your audio I had the best ink in my life so far

04:17:11.760 --> 04:17:18.000
The corruption has begun and I'll never feel better than that

04:17:18.800 --> 04:17:20.800
Only when you ink to me

04:17:21.320 --> 04:17:23.320
welcome me I

04:17:23.320 --> 04:17:25.680
Love when you get mindbroken without me even trying

04:17:47.560 --> 04:17:49.560
Get up there when she

04:17:50.080 --> 04:17:52.080
That's what you get for

04:17:52.960 --> 04:17:57.400
That's what you get for proving me slightly wrong you just get spat on I

04:17:59.160 --> 04:18:03.280
Like how that's my default like oh you're mildly proving me wrong and

04:18:03.840 --> 04:18:08.200
For your insolence you receive spit on your face should have been me

Honestly, yeah

04:19:57.920 --> 04:20:02.240

04:20:03.120 --> 04:20:04.960
She's gone

04:20:04.960 --> 04:20:08.600
Sure, here's kind of although. Yeah, you like that what I'm in in here

04:20:12.120 --> 04:20:20.360
Hi, mummy. Do you want us to train for you until we can get what? No, no, this is the questions for another stream. Yeah, he's up

04:20:20.680 --> 04:20:25.480
Hi, strongy. Here's my two cents on the hair color debate as there is hair color is literally

04:20:26.240 --> 04:20:31.720
Translates the blue green and my lingo. So she's both Emmy is ginger. There's no debate. Thank you

04:20:32.720 --> 04:20:35.400
Strongy, you're my kind of woman. Oh, yeah

04:20:36.160 --> 04:20:39.400
I'm a huge joker and I'm known to push buttons

04:20:39.400 --> 04:20:42.360
I feel like a fun poking at you until your Scottish rage comes out

04:20:42.360 --> 04:20:49.520
I don't get angry like I don't get angry a person I get angry at like an animate object like video game

04:20:49.520 --> 04:20:50.720
Does that make sense?

04:20:50.720 --> 04:20:52.720
Then I'd give you head pads and kiss

04:20:52.920 --> 04:20:59.440
Your pout is better and cuddle my little seaweed until she smiles. I don't get angry at people. I don't find it hard

04:21:00.280 --> 04:21:03.280
Like, I don't know how to get angry at someone

04:21:07.000 --> 04:21:09.480
Only thing I've worried about with

04:21:11.160 --> 04:21:13.160
Is getting hair in the teeth

04:21:13.920 --> 04:21:18.360
No, no, you're not you're not that no we don't we don't do that here

04:21:20.200 --> 04:21:23.200
We don't do that here you can eat the peach but you're not eating the clam

04:21:23.200 --> 04:21:26.720
Okay, the clam does not want any attention. Please leave the clam alone

04:21:29.440 --> 04:21:35.200
I should play League of Legends with Azura if I want to get angry. I don't I can't even comprehend the game

04:21:35.200 --> 04:21:38.360
I think I've seen gameplay of it three times and I can't comprehend it. I

04:21:39.120 --> 04:21:42.720
Don't know what I'm doing. It's like an enemy has been slain. Well, yeah

04:21:42.720 --> 04:21:49.240
I mean doesn't death occur in this game an ally has been slain. Well, yeah, lady like change

04:21:49.240 --> 04:21:53.820
Well, everyone's supposed to survive no clam attention. They've been a bane another or the beans different

04:21:55.480 --> 04:21:58.400
The the peril of the clam is different

04:21:59.800 --> 04:22:05.480
Nobody could comprehend it at the start. I don't make sense Johnny's hair color is yet. I

04:22:09.080 --> 04:22:15.400
Like my hair. I love the style of it, but I'm a sucker for bunches and symmetrical hair. I'm absolutely suffer for it

04:22:16.600 --> 04:22:21.360
Do you want to just grab my pony tails from behind my little twin tails?

04:22:21.360 --> 04:22:27.600
I do technically a twin tail and I like that is double bunches. You can't see it from the front

04:22:27.600 --> 04:22:31.480
Well, I guess you kind of can I have double bunches behind my

04:22:32.560 --> 04:22:39.440
Seashells I have a I have a ponytail at the seashells create that bump and then I have them at the bottom of the hair as well

04:22:39.440 --> 04:22:42.800
So I have double bunches and I love it. I love it

04:22:44.120 --> 04:22:46.120
Your sucker sure. Hope so

04:22:46.720 --> 04:22:48.720
Twin tail handlebars. Yeah, I

04:22:50.560 --> 04:22:52.720
Love it. I love it. I love oh

04:22:53.440 --> 04:22:57.960
Yeah, no that reminded me something's like oh your character so ugly compared to everyone else. I'm like

04:22:58.560 --> 04:23:04.000
Nice try me nice try. I'm pure six. You can admit it. It's fine

04:23:06.960 --> 04:23:12.960
Only thing I'm worried about oh already read that. How do you oh my god? Oh my god, there's no more marshmallow questions, right?

04:23:12.960 --> 04:23:14.960
I'm going offline good night

04:23:15.920 --> 04:23:22.240
Anyone else in that? Oh, there's no marshmallow questions. I went offline instantly. How do you know?

04:23:22.360 --> 04:23:25.200
Yeah, but the cake. Yes, your honor. Probably

04:23:25.840 --> 04:23:27.840
You see that again. Go rest. I

04:23:28.520 --> 04:23:32.280
Should rest and what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna go for a nap, okay?

04:23:32.880 --> 04:23:40.600
And then I'm gonna go for a bath and then I'm gonna deal with all the backlog of work because the video game has been delayed

04:23:41.200 --> 04:23:43.200
surprise surprise me who didn't

04:23:43.920 --> 04:23:50.800
Fucked up, but it's fine. The game's still playable. That's the main thing and still one-handable if you want. Um, I

04:23:52.360 --> 04:23:55.960
Need to hand over all the audio assets now. Um

04:23:57.400 --> 04:24:00.560
Which is gonna take a hot second to edit but once it's done

04:24:00.560 --> 04:24:02.880
It's one of those jobs that like I can tick off the list

04:24:02.880 --> 04:24:08.660
It's not like a reoccurring job like at the moment the shorts with the girls are like reoccurring jobs and they kill me

04:24:08.900 --> 04:24:14.180
Um, because like it's not like I can take it off a list or anything

04:24:16.100 --> 04:24:19.300
Eh, if Mercy doesn't have a room up she's

04:24:22.100 --> 04:24:24.100
Oh, no, I'm going into rare

04:24:25.060 --> 04:24:27.060
It's not out yet. No, um

04:24:27.540 --> 04:24:32.100
When are we getting the official news about the game? Um, the game is free

04:24:32.740 --> 04:24:37.540
Um free access. It will be uh posted on the alternative twitters

04:24:37.540 --> 04:24:41.140
It will not be posted from the main account due to the content

04:24:42.180 --> 04:24:45.140
Like the main VLR account due to the content inside the game

04:24:46.180 --> 04:24:47.700
Can you post that?

04:24:47.700 --> 04:24:49.700
Can you post that now you can so

04:24:52.580 --> 04:24:54.580
I mean, maybe we could

04:24:55.220 --> 04:25:00.660
Do it announce it, but then link the girls all no no, it's too risky. It's too risky. I'm not risking. I'm not risking it

04:25:01.540 --> 04:25:04.980
Uh, also the girls are getting access to fansly on august 1st, so

04:25:05.060 --> 04:25:07.060
Do without what you will

04:25:09.220 --> 04:25:14.020
I don't know what they're planning, but how about you? What kind of content?

04:25:16.740 --> 04:25:18.740
One-handed gameplay content

04:25:21.540 --> 04:25:25.300
So play with headphones. Yeah, definitely

04:25:27.300 --> 04:25:29.860
Um getting the debit card ready

04:25:30.740 --> 04:25:35.540
We will be there, but when are you gonna be on it? I need a bit more

04:25:36.100 --> 04:25:42.660
Time and what I'm gonna purposely do is let the girls go ahead and do what they want to like get as much support for them

04:25:43.060 --> 04:25:45.060
Because they actually get 100 of their

04:25:45.860 --> 04:25:48.420
VLR don't take any cut from their bandslay at all

04:25:48.820 --> 04:25:53.380
Um, so I'd rather they like get success and like more stabilized income if they want to do it

04:25:53.380 --> 04:25:56.100
But I have requested them like hey remember

04:25:56.340 --> 04:26:02.740
YouTube's your main income source like don't don't be cut. I said to them and actually you can quote this the girls will quote that

04:26:02.740 --> 04:26:06.980
I said don't come to me with five bandsly streams on your schedule

04:26:07.860 --> 04:26:09.860
And they all agreed and they said yeah, that's fine

04:26:10.660 --> 04:26:12.660
Yeah, hold on. I'm hydrating

04:26:17.620 --> 04:26:24.260
Don't feel send on bad. Yeah, I said look hey your income sources YouTube like then he didn't mess this up

04:26:26.900 --> 04:26:32.580
And the price is going to be same completely up to the girl. We do not take any cut from

04:26:34.020 --> 04:26:35.460
Uh

04:26:35.460 --> 04:26:40.260
We do not take any cut so we don't dictate the price the girls pick their prices whatever they're happy with

04:26:40.980 --> 04:26:46.580
And not up to be aware of the agency because it's not stipulated in the contract at all

04:26:46.980 --> 04:26:53.700
Um, are you winning son? Yeah, we defeated the enemy of the puzzle game, which is actually a really good game recommend

04:26:54.020 --> 04:27:01.780
Say strong reeflings. Don't give her ideas. The zeroes will play for 40 hours straight. Stop. What if a zero plays the league on that? No

04:27:03.620 --> 04:27:05.620
Yeah, she's gonna spank him

04:27:06.660 --> 04:27:08.660
I stayed up past my bedtime to watch so the

04:27:09.700 --> 04:27:11.700
the fun

04:27:14.020 --> 04:27:17.540
As in your adult working bedtime

04:27:19.620 --> 04:27:22.520
Not child bedtime

04:27:23.780 --> 04:27:25.780
Right

04:27:28.260 --> 04:27:30.500
Is there a fucking answer are you about to get yeeted?

04:27:34.020 --> 04:27:39.300
Okay, proud of you son. A lot of the girls will play the game. Yes, they will. I'm gonna ask them to

04:27:41.460 --> 04:27:43.700
Whoa, strongy you could be a healer

04:27:44.580 --> 04:27:46.580
Honestly, well, I have the one

04:27:47.620 --> 04:27:52.420
That goes in the back door. You know how there's like those those pink ones

04:27:53.140 --> 04:27:55.300
That go in the clam. I don't have that one

04:27:56.420 --> 04:28:01.140

04:28:02.820 --> 04:28:05.540
I need to I need to invest them again

04:28:06.740 --> 04:28:08.740

Thank you very much. Don't give me a heart attack like that again

04:28:20.260 --> 04:28:22.100
I was like, uh

Well, let's catch the word but no, okay. We're good. We're good

04:28:30.500 --> 04:28:32.500

04:28:36.660 --> 04:28:41.860
We may also have a sponsorship actually on the video again that is not for

Are you gonna have collapse with other girls on patreon outside the agency?

04:30:56.980 --> 04:31:01.460
No, it's not planned at the moment. It's very difficult to plan and all honestly

Uh, we're playing roller coaster tycoon tomorrow. I don't know if we can get through the campaign

04:31:59.060 --> 04:32:02.980
I can't recall how long the campaign is but it'll be interesting

04:32:03.060 --> 04:32:06.100
I'm not gonna build a roller coaster though because I don't know how to do it

04:32:07.460 --> 04:32:08.980
Okay

04:32:08.980 --> 04:32:13.940
I'll see you goofy gobers tomorrow. Thank you so much. Shibi got home an hour ago

04:32:16.260 --> 04:32:21.220
I'll need to send her a message to make sure she's all hydrated because you get really dehydrated on planes apparently

04:32:21.700 --> 04:32:27.140
But thank you so much for the longer stream as weird calling a forever stream a longer stream lies

04:32:27.620 --> 04:32:29.620
Lies, it's not a long stream

04:32:29.860 --> 04:32:34.980
But as I said the endurance picks up again next week not this week next week

04:32:35.060 --> 04:32:39.540
I'm gonna also put up the rest of my weight rooms as well because they're all lurking in the shadows

04:32:40.500 --> 04:32:45.220
But yes, I see you goofy gobers tomorrow. I love you and I give you a bit

04:32:46.500 --> 04:32:48.500
That's right. I caught you by surprise

04:32:48.980 --> 04:32:50.980
I didn't even let you pick her up

04:32:51.220 --> 04:32:53.220
Mmm
