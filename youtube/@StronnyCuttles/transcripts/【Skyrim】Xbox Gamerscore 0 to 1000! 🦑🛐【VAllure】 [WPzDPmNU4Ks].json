{"text": " Testing, testing. Attention, please. Attention, attention. Hear you, hear you. Skyrim belongs to the North. That's my hear you, hear you. Why are you saying I hate you? I'm not even fricking spawning yet! Let me spawn in! You know, I learned something new yesterday thanks to TikTok so I can't wait to talk about it. Right, testing. This is Ambroker. See this fricking, you fricking freaks? Oh my God! Oh my God! I'm YouTube, I got accepted from YouTube monetization like right now. No way! I just got accepted for YouTube monetization right fricking now. No way! Wait, but I need to do my stream then. Wait! Oh my God! I literally just opened up YouTube studio. I've been accepted. No way! Wait, do I need to go offline and do my... No, I'll do it tomorrow. Oh my God! We did it! What the frick? What the frick frack tiddly-tack-tick-tack-patty-work? Oh my God! Wait, and hopefully this doesn't say anything. Wow! Wow! I just fricking checked. Right, right. We're still going to do Skyrim today because you know, Skyrim belongs to the Norths. But tomorrow I'll get to do my monetization celebration stream! And my toe is like amazing for it so I'm excited. Oh my God! That's amazing. Right, if you're fricking watching right now, don't worry about how you call it. The memberships aren't activated because I need to go in and tell it what to call the tiers and stuff. But I'm 100% sure tier one is $1.99 USD. This is to prevent anyone gaining access via gift to membership streams. And then I believe the membership price, like the actual price, is $4.99 USD. Does that sound right? I need to ask you guys. I need to ask you guys what sounds right. You guys call the shots. Yeah, if it's $4.99 USD and then Patreon's $5 USD then it's $9.99 total to support your Oshii at Veiler. You're okay. That seems right. Okay, that sounds okay. Everyone's going to give me the thumbs up. Congrats on the monetization. Doesn't mean we won't support you in other ways anymore though. Oh, thank you so much. I really appreciate it. Why are you giving me money for getting more money? What the fuck? It's an infinite money glitch. Oh my God. Also, there was an offline donation by Shank. Shank says, thank you for the tip, by the way. He says, I'm over here squidding my dick. I got ink on my dick right now. Which is so good. Thank you, Tim Shuttle. Congrats on the monetization. Thank you. And Bajinga as well. Thank you again for the tip, for the 20. That was a big tip. Thank you. Okay, to prevent gifts, you need to set the membership quote above five bucks. Are you serious? Wait, wait, wait, wait. Wasn't it not membership can only be gifted? Stop giving me! Why are you giving me money for being able to make Oh my God. No, I have to end my ASMR series now. I have four ASMR videos. I owe you. Oh, and I'm doing an endurance stream today. It's over. Reluctantly saying thank you for the tip. Wait, I could have sworn you can only gift the lowest tier membership on YouTube or has that been updated since? I won't say who so they can announce it themselves, but someone else has also gotten monetized. Oh my God, we're all done are monetized. No way. Like, okay, so the only reason we didn't like monetize faster in quotation marks is because you stop it. Don't give me money for getting money. Preordering my search. Thank you. Don't stay down for the tip. That's crazy. That's freaking crazy. Gifts go to the most expensive tier under five bucks. So I need to set it as 501. That looks terrible though. That looks so greedy, but I can't have any outsiders in the membership streams because I need to use a lot of euphemisms. Are you squid me right now? Shank. Oh, it's offline. I'm all about stron of the bath. Thanks, Shank, for the tip. You guys will get the Blackwater reference very shortly. Super training up. Virginia. Stop. Actually, one cent greed law. Actually, it's two cent greed because I wanted it $4.99 as fat. Said it to sit. No, $6 is too much. This is too much money to ask for, like, for membership stuff. Oh, right, that's it. When I said we're making an agency together, we flinched. I wasn't kidding. Oh, I see. And our snowberries are here. They just did an ASMR stream. We all have to keep our voices down, okay? The snowberries are asleep. Fine, you've got it. Set it to 999. I would start at $60 just to be sure. Post up. Hi, icy raiders. Hi, snowberries. I just unlocked monetization. I didn't know until I freaking went on my channel. It just happened right now. I'm not going to do my monetization celebration today. I'm going to do it tomorrow and then it gives me less time to do endurance skyrim unless we come back to maybe switch up the thingy. But that's okay. It's actually a perfect transition from icy stream. Hi, hi, little icicle. But yes, we are all getting monetized very slowly, which is fantastic. Oh my gosh, you can get support via email or chat. Don't worry, that chat support thing does absolutely nothing. I assure you, it doesn't do a single thing, okay? I actually, I tell a lie, they did help me one time, so I'll give it up. Amy, thank you, Amy, for your clap, clap, clap. Apparently, there's one other person that has been processed. When we applied, it was like, yeah, it takes a month for them to review your chat. A month! A month to review James Cameron's avatar, excuse me. A month to freaking review Assassin's Creed Brotherhood, excuse me. Oh no, no, oh you guys so much ASMR video. But I do have some good news about VTuber Collabs. I finally, I finally sent away. So now I'm waiting on the girls. The ball is now in the girls court that I'm collabing with. Yeah, yesterday, I was listening to a music creator called Yoast. He's a Dutch and he was in Eurovision and he said, welcome to Europe. Life is till the end, Europe, Europe, Europe. Turns out he has a song where it goes, suck my, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm. So just imagine me playing the song and repeat in the dark, taping up four ASMR collabs in one go. A month review time sounds realistic, given the fact that your streams are all above 10 hours. Like I also thank you for the tip again, but you're giving a lot of money. You need to be careful. Are you screaming me right now? Thank you for the tip. Oh my God. Damn, I almost got that song out of my head. Yeah, so basically just imagine me in a dark room. Just, I had this song on repeat. I'm like, yeah, okay. Right, Wolf Mums, Pamper You to Sleep, right? Okay, what's next? Okay, Jealous VTubers drag you in an alleyway for tangos. Okay, but what's next? What's next? Right, next script now. Like I was on it. I was on it. Anonymous. It's the silent and on his back. He's giving money, but he's not saying anything. He's not getting Brian to say anything. Thank you for the tip. But yeah, anyway, that's how I work. I don't know how you work, but I work like a madman. Had to take a shower. So I've got to listen at 1.5 speed for the next 15 minutes. I was not prepared for the super speed beat up. So I was as strong as I forgot to live tweet or tweet. If you mean tweet, I have absolutely horrific news. I am the worst VTuber to ever spawn. I never use my emotes. I spent like so much on all these emotes. I never use them. I never tweet out when I'm live, because I start at the same time every single day and I'm like, you want to be here, you're gonna be here. Somebody, absolutely. Next script. YouTube to monetize you one day after you get approved. I mean, depending on how the monetization celebration goes tomorrow, that's quite plausible. But hey, at least a little bit YouTube history. Don't mind if I make the headlines for Veal Ur. So you guys go and support my gen mates. That's right. There are five other lovely girls in the description below for you to check out. If you cannot stand, Todd winning yet again with the Death Grip, the Skyrim has over female VTubers. Okay. So if you've had enough of that, Denny, you worry. I've got you sorted out. Sheepsters is going live in two minus two hours. I believe Emma and Azura, my goodness Azura, and is coming for my Endurance Stream title. For Goodness Gravy, she was up on a farm. No, it's not called Farmville. The farming star, Jew Valley, for goodness sake. And then she beady popped out of 10 of her Endurance Stream. I'm like, damn, they're coming from my title. I'm gonna show them how it's done. Okay, I'm gonna show them how it's done. I woke up feeling sick and I was like, oh, maybe I would do an Endurance Stream. But the moment I hit go live, it feels like I have been given a second burst of energy, a second wind, if you will. It's like that cinematic moment in like the video game thing. We're like, oh, Brian. Congrats on monetization. Does the meet and greet VIP pass come with the highest membership tier pre-order? Zarian. Dapper. Why would you give 100? That's so much. You never even said anything, Dapper bucket. Oh my God. Thank you for the 100. Iron Reaper 100. Why are you? Why are you giving me money for being able to earn more money? What's going on? What's going on? Have I missed something in the VTuber etiquette book? Iron Reaper, thank you for the 100. Dapper, thank you for the 100. Zarian, congrats on monetization. Meet and greet for anyone who goes over $20 on the donut. That's terrible. You can't say that part out loud. Literally, everyone is giving your, yeah, please make sure you are fully sorted before you give any money. Please understand, I adore what I do. I have been welcomed with open arms into the VTuber community as someone who could definitely have been described as an outsider. And instead of being shunned, I was welcomed and taught the ropes, which I'm so thankful for. But please understand, like, I can stream for free. I love what I do, okay? Anonymous with a 20 with no message again. Brian, you look, you need to put Brian to work, guys, okay? You need to put Brian to work. Oh, Anonymous gave me 20 because I said the 20 thing. That is terrible. But we've done it. We officially have finished our first week at Bueller headquarters. Literally, everyone has done fantastic streaming. I am very happy to see some of the girls taking a break. Orvon Biscay. Brian. We don't like giving YouTube a cut. Wait, oh, that's why you just stream elements. Okay, I understand. I read about that. Thank you, Orvon Biscay. Brian! Don't knows will continue until morale improves. Congratulations. Wait, why did I know that? Quote. Do you guys hear Brian at all when he talks? Yeah, you do. Surely you do. Oh my god. Wait, you said I said your name yesterday correctly. Rilke? Rilke? Cadmus? Thank you for the tip. Why did I know that quote? Yeah, we hear him. Okay, thank god. God, it feels like so much longer. You've always been here. I think because, like, my average streamed week is probably what a VTuber achieves in an entire month. So it feels like I've been here for a very long time. I was like, nope, this is officially my first, like, strong, you know, first second week of streaming. Ancient joke. The beatings will continue until the more. Okay, that's okay. Okay, okay, okay. Guys, do you know a perfect way to party the achievement? A really big storm of bad joke. What did you even say? Was that supposed to be a joke? I don't get it. I don't get the joke if that was supposed to be a joke. So you're getting crickets. Who's ready? Who's ready for bi-zura, bi-zura, bi-zura. Now, I know that's not in this game, but bi-zura. Remember that time I accident... Wait, can you hear the game? Can you hear any of that? You can't hear any of that. Oh, oh, oh, wait, get monetization off the screen right now. Oh, my freaking mouse won't hover over... Right, there we go. Oh, my voice is cracking already. I've never even started. Oh, oh, oh.

your one should be a motion the rest can have being practiced can you check your difficulty I think it's so bug no no nothing wrong with the difficulty of the game where what do we need to oh wait there's about to be an enemy that comes through I think or something we're about to jump on hope bye tomorrow is six out of six I would love that for all the girls they're so excited come on they can't see us they don't know he can't see me at all is he like directly at me by the way oh my god I forgot how clunky the frickin if you're late oh my god this is so clunky yes yes a key a key um take all I'm definitely gonna equip these because they're a lot better than right I know I'm dressing up as the enemy okay but that's heavy armor uh we're gonna wait where the frick is the key or he gets the key okay storm coke and drip in the same sentences oxymoronic how do they're both bad but storm cooks are just worse the high king was leader of the good factions the sky room and he surrendered to the empire because they were the less bad option I didn't know that I thought it was like the thalmor embassy came in and they were like you can he worship talus anymore and I was like eh you can't he come into my company and tell me what I can do and can he do so eh I'll pick this guy storm cooks like you can't he just go and be doing that like that's a region right where's the enemies oh oh yeah that's right look at that come oh my god it's so bad on pc like when we analogue stick oh wow kill cam stealth goes from input I don't know I'm normally like a two-handed player I always try to be an archer and I always end up two-handed because there's a really good freaking um there's a really good um enchantment which you can get from uh the yeah sorry torturer yeah yeah you're trying to tell me that uh oh oh she getting it she annihilated him no I haven't seen him uh you can lock pick these for like ah I guess we'll try it so there's eh you can literally smurf this if you leave and then shuggle it hear that hear that if you do super gently see so we now know it's left side oh I'm not getting pranked there you can literally smurf like all this stuff if you want it to be made you can pick up this stuff but we are actually going to sell it because it's good money I don't think I think there's a shield behind here if you wanted to do yeah if you want a shield then uh there is one here but I don't really bother with shield that I do two-handed so we're going to get a warhammer very shortly eh there should be coins down here and one of these if I'm not mistaken I guess 300 no 300 coins seems a bit extreme maybe 30 coins in there and we are just going to blast through it um try two-handing mage mage is my fave no two-handed warrior two-handed lightweight warrior and you can muck around with a bow and an arrow like if you do the nightingale quest you get light armor that's pretty sneaky but the thief-skilled armor especially for this stamina and like item increase is so good um as for how we're going to tackle what we do first um I'm going to purposefully do the companion's quest line and then load a previous save because I don't like oh sorry sorry hold on I was out of stamina I was trying to reach up um that I see it just posted a very watery tweet no way the the piss corp uh accusations we ain't beating them today and we ain't beating them tomorrow and the nightingales yeah pure mage is hard mode I there should be something up here if I remember correctly on the right side of these rocks what was it oh it's just a weak coin purse I got 14 gold honestly per scaley boy he's he's gone you he couldn't get out but the bars are broken now I love the jewel wheels nightingale peeler no not peeler that's awful but that's hilarious at the same time um right there are spiders so if any of you are arachnophobic wow um don't worry they are getting absolutely yeah I've been poisoned I think they give stamina of frostbite but yeah please look away if you're arachnophobic we are just gonna blast through this area uh did I come from here uh um I think there's something to look up there maybe I don't know I can't there is a bear ahead I say look away but you're too busy doing something on your alternative twitter so it's okay she doesn't have to know and we are going to take this for some really quick money I believe there is an achievement for holding 100 000 gold at one stage the best way to make gold I have found is by enchanting and selling that jewelry um there is a bit of a mild strat that I devised myself I don't know if it's the strat uh survival mode survival adds the need absolutely not what is this survival adds the need to eat sleep and stay warm it also adds challenges such as no no and no I'm a vanilla skyrim oh my god is that is that pc option um there he goes I just realized am I not am I not getting achievements on xbox for this I don't think I am I'm not aww I named the stream zero to one thousand oops well that's a very accurate run are you playing anniversary um it's an additional challenge oh well we should have gotten an achievement there but we're not playing xbox some dumb imagine having to eat eat 10 cheese wheels um so there is a really easy mine you can clear I think it will give us two handed um that's just dead ahead it's like right in your oh wait actually sorry the standing stones first uh standing stones I believe there are 12 standing stones which give you a certain boost such as a faster leveling exp uh under certain things so there's a mage stone there's a thief stone and there is a warrior stone but there's different ones as well one uh I believe is like a mule stone where you just straight up can carry more items uh on your persons uh yeah literally activate thief activate mage activate warrior uh we are gonna do thief um are we gonna do thief what's warrior I've forgotten right we'll do warrior normally I do thief but we will we're gonna clear out this mine very quickly we're just gonna pick up uh ingredients as we go along the way of the stones the way war yeah this should be an achievement to find them all yes um um well so they're just not have achievements at all because I'm not I'm playing on xbox game pass but it's not like instance to uh xbox uh don't be too afraid of the wolves on the they are too hip they can give you rock join oh I've gone past the mine already they can give you is it no is it rock join or is it lockjaw I think it's rock join oh my memory of me I've gone so past this mineshaft yeah here we go right there should be a baddie out here hello yeah yeah yeah you're playing a novice no I'm not these accusations are unfound it is rock join I thought that but strony where is the blarney and yes I know the blarney stone what are you trying to make a balamori joke there's a tripwire here in this mine but don't worry about it as I said you can please carry them up whatever level you want I like blasting through and just absolutely annihilate and take this like it's so good there are some later stages were even being on easy mode isn't that bad although I have to admit I guess this is registering as PC Skyrim and it's quite different oh this is so sad they made this person mine themselves to death they've had me working down here for days now it's not the time that's getting to me though it's these tunnels I've told this countless times now to add extra support to the weak sections of the tunnel if only we had more of these wooden beams that were we reinforced with bronze honestly if I hear the earth shift one more time above my head I'm so stressed I may stop drinking for good I mean what's a Nord without his mead and he died because of a collapsing so my granddad was a miner and he used to tell me really rough stories about um the he is like being in the mineshaft and all of that uh and they had a mine collapse and within two minutes they had already killed the guy out and he was gone like he just perished it was a main a minor yes um they did I think bandits normally have like a lock pick and coin but that's not really the best um you can't just like straight up grab this shit but there is a big chest in here so we're just gonna clear out the wait unless we oh I was gonna say unless we sneak but the guys right there um yeah but like my granddad used to talk so openly about the um we just got it to stick oh call is oh no hold on everyone knows I'm bad at log picking now um okay we've got our first what are you 20 damage right 20 damage um he like spoke so openly about it and I'm like granddad granddad that's just straight up like stuff that's like man-made like horrors beyond comprehension type stuff uh this chest okay we're definitely on pc because amber does not look like that what the heck what the heck I've never seen that in Skyrim before am I going crazy or I don't know I'm losing it right don't get ready to swing that's so good oh um if the book is valued at 50 coins or more you will level up reading that book if you are ever in a section and you're like what the heck are all these books if that book is valued at 50 uh septum or more then it is actually a skill book oh oh my god that's so satisfying that's so freaking satisfying hold on a minute yeah that's a yeah bone archer um I think there's a tiny little chest on the edge here I think there's a little bug with a difficulty no not at all I'm playing on oh wait it's just in a vein if you didn't know um these are called veins when you can see the ore sticking out from the wall it's quite interesting honestly maybe I should talk about mining because my granddad spoke to me in big detail about it all um and like how they used to come out and like their eyes really bloodshot red and everything have I missed that chest back there I think I have but it's not a big deal yeah I thought that and I just like I was like I've missed that chest haven't I but it's fine if you run with your weapon out your stamina will decrease but that's okay you don't really need it especially when you're just so good at the game like playing legendary mode like as I'm playing right now if you didn't know I'm playing legendary mode like just because I'm such a pro everything becomes really easy and you just have to like understand the strats as long as you like swing first basically you win every fight and the reason why they hardly do any damage to me is because I have such high defense of course and not any other reason if you're looking for work go see um Rayloff said you could help me Rayloff of course you're he's a friend he promised you could help we escaped from the amperials together she lied as easily as she breathes what are you talking about this is legendary mode literally like I know it's hard to believe that a vtuber is just so good at skyrim that they can play legendary mode as casually as I can but it's just it's just the way it is okay so the area is now just discovering that dragons are coming back I don't know why but I actually believe you you've got the look of someone who's just seen the dragon legendary easy but never heard of it legendary is easy mode because I'm just so skilled at this game open options and show that it's legendary fine I will I will show that it's legendary oh look what's over there hold on what's over there look a little to the left look a little to the left see I told see I told you it was legendary I don't know see I don't know why you doubted me for a millisecond why this isn't legendary like I'm just back oh oh my god like did you guys see what I see just posted on our alternative Twitter oh my god yeah go look yeah no it's crazy oh my god I don't know she did that it's good to see you oh yeah good okay we are gonna go ahead and just deliver the news to the yorl of dragons reach that's not the name of the town of white run we are gonna oh something's at me oh

I'll stroke your ego and some other things too at the same time you know we are gonna try and hit some of these markers the reason for this is because there's a thieves guild quest at this particular location so we will unlock it um speech 100 honestly yeah I'm sorry to doubt you look it's okay stuff happens like things in life you know sometimes it's just once you once you swallow the the truth that um you know someone may be better at your favorite video game then it becomes easy you know life looks so good uh driving my driving my fork listening and watching stroney okay I need to describe in detail what we're doing what is that those are like clouds that are being developed by horses footprints that looks like a texture gone wrong we're currently traveling to white run we're just uh

tablets go to bleak falls bearer we are going to bleak falls bar right so this is how you make a sugar ton of money the arcane and channel we're just and you literally get to level up just by destroying by destroying stuff it's pretty cool anyway we'll let them keep yapping away because we're about to unlock our dragon born powers is that john skyrim from the hit legendary show skyrim yeah but at the end of the fight you can decide to kill him or go away I could have sworn he attacks me on xbox I'm wondering if it's possible um there might be a few courted differences battleborn give me your money I don't have any money why didn't they hire me to be the NPCs like seriously could you imagine me like hanging a boot I'd actually I'd actually be so wait why does that say wait wait has a fricked up map there we go where am I going leak falls bar oh and you go uh we're just going to go on riverwood real quick but not a big yapper as I'm actually I'm having a mental debate right now um so because we're not currently getting achievements like on steam or here I'm wondering if I should do a short two hour stream then come back and do the monetization stream possibly I'm having to master jabay about that um oh my god there's a firefly it's hard to stay awake when I'd rather be asleep everything is never as easy as I fall asleep there are wolves currently biting my ankles but it's fine oh oh no it's not I'm gonna get lock joints perish be gone you can meet sister outside white run before doing the burp dark brother yes you can meet him in his travels it's possible but you just have to beat him up first in the it's from UG can't wait for carry okay sneak peek at the next concert oh the next be allure cover the fact you know the lyrics to that song off my heart is alarming it was like a really big song I was like can I believe your eyes like 10 million fireflies lit up the world of life at least these are bandits I can't remember what the loot is up here oh we got to hit uh I think there's a bad guy up here so we're actually gonna sneak for one oh something can see us oh we're hitting again I think there is a bad guy in the chair up here we just need a little oh yeah oh yeah I heard that knife don't think I didn't hear it we're no okay well he can see me so does the cat the kill counts in this game are so ridiculous literally bludgeoned on to death I'll still leave the the light armor on I know why are you doing two-handed with light armor look I just like light armor okay heavy armor you'll never guess what heavy armor takes up a lot of room and it's heavy very popularly 10 years ago remembers on every rip that rip that guy oh rip that guy I thought you meant the singer uh leather hat worn from iron hat I don't know that's canonically how strong he uh expires people headbutt let's do the hell with it we are in legendary you we can't let them hit us yeah we're one shot right now so we need to make sure we don't get hurt oh I remember going up these stairs for the first time and I was absolutely terrified of everything in this game oh and I was I was probably oh it's probably just the baby playing on medium difficulty the default uh oh don't worry we didn't actually get hit it oh we didn't get hit that was called a whiff that's that's what's known as a whiff in video games don't worry don't worry we're still fine no the guy oh someone's shooting at me I heard that bone I don't can I compare something if I ever play skyrim nowadays I cheat with 300 speed and speed malt command what's that I don't even know what that is uh there should be a little dialogue do I have a bow and arrow I don't actually think I have a arrow I had the chance to pick up a bow and I didn't that's what I get for no don't worry oh we're doing the golden claw oh my god right I'm actually gonna pick up our bow for moments like that where we could legit just grab that stuff there should be a little chest here oh okay yeah my wee glazegut kiss ah well oh such a good lock pick oh 47 gold look we're not exactly breaking the bank here right I think we'll do tomorrow uh I'm just thinking why am I why I'm I'm so dumb and set this up but not to be on xbox game pass um because I'm not getting any achievements I think we'll do I'll play for two hours and we'll redirect into sheepsters when she comes up and then I will replay everything that I achieved basically oh this is supposed to be a tutorial if you don't I've just upset him he pulls it to show you that it's wrong and I think he perishes here but he's yeah yeah it's like no hell so it's uh snake snake dolphin you could just run the do the campaign and do monetization yeah or yeah actually maybe um maybe we just do the main campaigns I wouldn't actually I would be quite happy and satisfied with Skyrim again if the book is worth more than 50 gold if we do the main quest lines instead then I would actually be happy with what we've achieved with Skyrim and we can oh my god I forgot there's rats here hold on oh I'm getting bit to death oh my gosh oh my god the swing is so bad this swing is terrible I know I should level up I'm saving it if you didn't know leveling up actually fully heals you so if you ever get in a in a bit of a pickle why didn't you warn him yes actually I wouldn't mind that today we'll do an endurance stream if that's okay it's freaking terrifying oh he's actually quite a bc boy like honestly oh my god he's just stabbed me wait something else is red I don't know hi oh my ankle do you know see that big massive spider and you pick on me you pick on me right hello did it you killed it now cut me down before anything else shows up okay again the rest the rest are winning please please you have this whole chamber and you pick on me right like is this cold he's actually one of the stronger enemies in the dungeon be as a script to death and instadize where's the golden claw same like a bandit attacking after takedown our dragon literally hand over the claw first okay no you're kind of real for that I'm sorry I wasn't thinking hello I'm sure you wouldn't betray me would you why should I share the treasure with anyone why are you are you just leading me there you feel I'm not sharing it with anyone is he about to get rolled by a drogger I see he is wait sorry there's one behind me he actually does I didn't know he was scripted to do that I always kill him instantly saw mudcrabs the other day horrible creatures wait yeah so it's on his person should we read his journal left trigger read my fingers are trembling the golden claws finally in my hands and with it the power of the ancient nordic heroes that fool lucian valerius has no idea that his favorite store decoration was actually the key to bleak falls thorough now I just need to get to the hall of stories and unlock the door the legends say there is a test that the nord's put in place to keep the unworthy way but that when you have the golden claw the solution is in the palm of your hand oh shit okay I saw that coming I'm so sorry I saw that coming I stood right on that trap oh shit why when I use a stamina move stop holding the freaking stamina bar holy crap when I do a stamina move it like makes me go to the side literally the only thing that's going to hurt me in this game is um is uh traps nothing else spider girl for jen too so there's one I don't want to talk about it too much just for my baby girls like bro we are only a weekend wait is there a drogger here I'm gonna crazy no and obviously I don't want to disrespect the baby girls um I was talking to them about like how development works behind the scenes um and unfortunately I used my words pretty poorly and it made some of them a bit uncomfortable so I don't really like talking about it too much um but it's due to my poor communication it's not due to the the girls in any way um but I what I can see is that development takes a year at least for a generation like an entire generation if you will um and like I don't want to say too much to make the girls feel like oh I'm just like casting them aside because like oh shiny gen two like you know that's absolutely not the case like I have said this from the start um if there is going to be a gen two it will be at least a year away like I am I am not rushing gens out just for the sake of doing it that's that's so unbelievably disrespectful to the girls who have placed faith in me um and like I still have a load of plans like now that the girls are in the stage of being monetized um there's a lot of plans we can now execute um like shorts as well there's a lot of shorts that need to be made um we have a fantastic uh shorts editor who did a hail mary to the website and applied themselves um and he's he's been a fantastic shorts editor he's pretty much done the majority of the work we have a a second one who's quite busy at the moment but we are gonna you know test if it's all good and if it's all good then you know we've got a lot of shorts play coming up um confirmed not a black company I I hope not I I said to the girls wholeheartedly and hopefully they will voucher they remember I said something along the lines I oh I wasn't paying attention sorry um I said if I ever do anything to you that is like absolutely hurting you that hurts you in any way that is a completely negative experience with me in any way take me out back and shoot me um like it was it's why I was very serious in the interview uh they they are welcome to talk about the interview if they like um am I gonna am I going back the way I came no I'm not um I said to them do not ever refer to me as your boss do not ever think of me as like a superior or something like that um that's definitely not ever how I want you to think like I am literally like in this with you we're we're memeing about we're figuring out what we want to do like um definitely take me out back and shoot me I'm so serious do not ever ever let me like oh that's it does more damage um like do not ever take me like you know what's that saying you live long enough to become the villain don't ever let me live become don't ever let me live long enough to become the villain take me out back and shoot me like oh it's why from the get go like if the girls sign on their contract for another year we the company um we offer an alternative outfit on the house for them as well as their pay increase goes sorry I'm fucking trying to like remember the the attack pattern and where the droggers spawn in this uh we'll talk about this but um like uh we definitely wanted to raise their income and the split goes uh 85 15 again kind of showing that we're not really here for grade we're kind of here for alternative reasons um so is there an actual say oh I don't own the company like I genuinely wholeheartedly my my name I'm basically my role is what is a creative director I already if you look on the thingy it'll tell you what the code is but you just need to move these twice and then you've got the correct code uh unless it's different on pc uh but basically I'm I was the creative director because I did used to have the scripts like I used to be the script maker I no longer have that there's no a manager all I do right now is stream as strone as me um and I send away shorts like I literally went into the girls DMs uh last night like after stream and I was like hey um can I get an audio of you saying this and they're like yeah I'll do it in the morning like that's that's all I do uh you're a cco I don't know what a cco is you're already like the opposite of a black company I mean you're ready to be dragonborn word of power learned force unrelenting force force um there's always an overlord or um some sort of um protector of the words of power which you know makes sense all things considered uh oh we're gonna break that down break it down now uh chief creative officer um no I've uh we're just gonna break everything down and I think there's a hidden chest by this waterfall although I could be completely wrong oh well no damn my memory coming through it's been how many years since I played this game and I'm like yeah there's a we hidden chest here then there's a there and then you can pick this up and then do that oh my god so mlg pro honestly um wow you executed that based on honestly foos sounds like the german word foo which means foot oh did you like my foos last night huh did did you like them streams tell me I don't have I feel so feminine right now I'm like the most feminine I might get more pedicures gonna say that that was so fun I enjoyed it the women was so like both the women were so lovely I felt so flustered in that stream though I hope it didn't come across too badly but I was like so out of my element like when I saw the time was an hour until uh sheepsters was up I was like oh my god what have I done like how did I speedrun it it's like so quickly have you got back the tool um it's still unfortunately very uh cut up so I've still got a wee band-aid on it I washed it uh in the bath uh she got me good all I'm gonna say is she got me good like it was deep you know like the side the smaller side part of your tool cut straight into that she was really sorry though but it's fine like stuff happens honestly and I believe she was new I believe she was new to the establishment so it's better to it's better for her to make a mistake on me because like hopefully I'm nice and understand and they're like I didn't say anything mean I was like oh you're fine like don't worry about it um and like the other women was like translating for her because she didn't speak English and I was like it's fine so I'm kind of glad she made that mistake on me rather than someone else who would have been like a Karen basically like I'm not gonna say anything about Australia but um I have I have heard some unique conversations occur I'm not even paying attention to the plot because I'm too busy rambling about my my life um look forward to the seat stream anyway who slashed your toe the lady that was doing my pedicure oh god I'm not like paying attention to the plot all right we've just handed over the dragon stone he's gonna translate it or something and then they're gonna know that the things are back this is a map of Skyrim it's very big we're in white run right now um we're actually gonna take a horse and carriage and go to rifting because I want to do the thieves guild quest yippee it's my favorite quest um so that's the Skyrim town that's the eh sorry that's an uh stormcork town stormcork is winterhold stormcork solitude is the legion at legion it's not legion hey ho strony here with my weekday donation telling you I'm off to work I'll catch you at the other end once I'm off okay enjoy your legendary mode conquest thank you so much yes monetization excited to see some of it yeah thank you so much for the tip please enjoy work tiny spiny or tiny spinning one or the other okay we're listening to plot okay um but yes legendary mode conquest thank you thank you uh yeah I think maybe we'll do just one big endurance Skyrim stream and then tomorrow we'll do monetization uh because since we're not really getting achievements is not really too much need your help again what do you need my help with oh yes sorry I completely forgot we're about to go get our dragon power in order to be the dragon born and utilize our powers we have to perish dragons yes so we're about to get our first uh shout power winterhold is the stormcork capital yeah the best quest link yeah we're gonna do the thieves guild we're also gonna bring the thieves guild back to its glory but i'm gonna need your guys's help for the tally um you can just run ahead of arolyth um it's not necessary to hang about strony has the wrong kind of tism to pay attention to multiple things that was yeah I can't do that I can like hyper I say they call it hyper focused I don't think it's even hyper focused it I'm not focused at all I'm just having a really good time um but yeah I'm very lucky that I don't experience like burnout or anything I'm like yeah I can't really oh sorry oh I'm so sorry to hear that you're having such a tough time oh yeah um right hold on I'm gonna unlock this little windmill as a landmarker when you pepega farm that's terrible when you discover a landmark you can fast travel to it which gets you around a lot faster um did you know that with frostbills you can make dragons land I did not know that I always use that shout um to get them to land oh it's so pretty look at the butterfly oh my god catch the butterfly rip its wings off for alchemy yes oh purple butterfly he didn't serve it okay now we need to wait for the game to hurry up with the npc so we're just gonna wait an hour oh there we go boom just like that no burnout lucky you I just don't experience it I like I've never experienced issues with that I don't feel it like I can feel tired like I can be like oh I need to go get some like tea and some food and then we'll play like for a couple of more hours I can do that no problem like at all I think the only time I feel I just feel frustrated that I don't have more time like when I was doing all the ASMR collabs like writing all the scripts back to back and actually I knew girl uh I'm used to tell a new girl and I was like hey you want to do some more and she was like fuck you want to do some more and she's like I know a lot about you and I was like oh that's embarrassing um but if you know a lot about me then you know how easy this collab is gonna be because I'll do all the work um but like I don't mind doing all the work if anyone's lurking I don't mind doing the work I actually prefer it um because it makes things a lot easier and make every arrow count I used to not experience burnout playing games but now I do which is a shame no so if you can't play video games that's like life burnout like if you would rather watch someone else play video games then like play it yourself livestreaming doesn't count because you're you're being tortured to watch me play Skyrim via uh my controller where the heck is this dragon is he on the floor oh it is okay oh let's spank his butt uh whoa it's actually kind of hurt me a little bit no you're stinking you're so stinking um see I've been on top here stamina bar is greed out only HP oh it's landed again oh you're hurting me stop it you're hurting me oh look at that two-handed 32 I should probably level that up we are gonna pick up the dragon bones these are like why on earth oh he must eat a weight ring guard um dovahki no uh so now this is where the NPCs get really weird around you I don't know what he's fighting right now he's locked on something a mud crab maybe nearby there's mud crabs over that way today I learned from a Scottish cuttlefish I may have burned out yes so if you'd rather um if you would rather um he's supposed to come up to me is it you normally an NPC walks up to you and goes oh my god you are the dragon born in a really poor like Swedish accent what type of two-handed we specialize in in hammer, axe, sword those there's aren't those one-handed yeah I'm just gonna pick up with the apocrity apocrity something like that did he die I guess they may have perished yeah I've been uninspired by the games to play recent so I'd prefer watching others like yes I think that is a symptom of burnout because of the I think the gray beards have summoned us oh it's Khajiit who's a good boy hey push push push do you seek to make a purchase uh uh what have you got for sale I'm gonna just sell some of my stuff that I don't want uh I'm gonna break that break it down now I'm gonna break all this stuff down it's just so we're not

don't I don't really know oh I definitely want to sell this I like how my speech gets better just selling stuff in general like you always want to hold on to soul gems they're very important may the road lead to oh that's why I always say safe travels land strider because of this game I think is really cute just safe travels land strider khajiit roleplay stream uh I actually don't know how to pur you know how some v-tubers compare like I can't do I can only roll my r by the pope even the gray beards screaming your name strongy you absolute sexy player thank you for the tip sorry or sorry y'all I think they're y'all ebw a bit a bit a bit a bit a bit a bit a bit a bit a bit a bit a bit a bit khajiit has squares if you have coins I told you y'all not alone we're not causing trouble so they're looking for uh someone but we're not doing that quest right now because we're trying to zoom past this so we can go and do the main quest of the dragonborn I'm wearing a hat with badass horns I'm the dover king known globally you're nobody at home he was so English in those songs for no reason I'm just kidding it is his accent he's allowed to have an accent if it's gosh I'm dover king known globally you're nobody at all like it yeah I think the English rapping accent is a bit better than the scots was the dragon there uh the watch tower was destroyed but we killed the dragon let's just skip a few dialogue and see it turns out I might be dragonborn dragonborn what do you know about the dragonborn when the dragon died I absorbed some kind of power so it's true the gray beards really were summoning you the vampire DLC I don't even think I saw that one the gray beards okay okay okay we get blah blah blah blah wait why does it say I need to keep oh I need to keep talking to him you've done a great service yes yes yes thank you thank you thank you yes please gift me uh axe of white run oh I'm staying of the sick oh I am so sorry for creating a mess that was a misfire it was a mis-input mis-input please don't fight me I didn't mean to do that I was uh the wrong wrong button there uh axe of white run target dies within three second fills a soul gem that's perfect because it's exactly the enchantment we want we're gonna break break it down now just breaking down everything um and we're gonna see if we can enchant our Nordic battle axe although I even have soul gem I have the world's weakest soul gem I'm gonna have to refill it so much if I end up using it uh this is the best I can do uh we're just gonna oh we're completely out of soul gems anyway I'm sorry it was a mis-input it was a mis-input I'm so sorry look I'm the I'm the thing anyway I'm the I'm a thing oh Lydia do you want to come with us so you can be filled with dragon bones follow me I need you oh my god wait if I got Lydia's face am I going crazy or do I have Lydia's face wait a minute did I accidentally recreate Lydia wait take take that helmet off right now I think I may have accidentally recreated Lydia no I'm I'm such a Lydia fanboy I recreated her as myself oh my god we even have the same nose and lips and everything that is hilarious I'm so sorry Lydia I'm just such a I must have like subconsciously made her this that shirt is making people nervous on it I'm still winning Lydia cuttles for real for real right we now need to go all the way up this mount well we need to go to Rorik's stead I versus it oh my god I'm such a fake gamer honestly I don't even know why you guys listen to me half the time uh 20's copied my whole flow word for word bar for bar it's a highland coup excuse me little gate let me just close that let me just close that oh it's the wee highland coup look at this no uh whoa whoa whoa look at yidwi horns fun uh I mentioned this other day actually uh I had a relative that owned one and uh the they they're actually super gentle uh but it made my relative blind in one eye lamal uh because the horn poked his eyeball um that was funny uh but he wasn't even mad at her it was a female highland coup I can't even remember what he named there but honestly it sounds like the most Scottish you know I don't care about your question the fuck up um literally I honestly must sound so Scottish a stream like oh my grandad used to work in the mines uh had a family that family member that literally owned a highland coup like oh my god that's where like no wonder I was raised in a bar and literally don't have manners like I just I never had it from the start a wee coup a wee highland coup my favorite part of a strong stream is our unofficial catchphrase did you know oh did you know did you know uh right I think we're gonna manually walk there there are gonna be wolves ahead but because we're playing legendary differently and I'm such an MLG pro at this game um it's honestly not problem and we might even see Cicero on the way it's unlikely we'll meet Cicero on the way there just because he spawns I find the Cicero spawns more northern west of the map and we are her and like going southern east which is the opposite um Lydia no hello this was as stupid as a feud with clan need something no oh oh she's got a bit of them oh what was that shadow freaking the honeybearing meadery ah yes a bit of a bit of meadery oh wait will we open a veal or a meadery why not that seems to be the way of like um content creators when they get in their end game they like come out with a product I'm like I think my end game would be video games like uh like paying to get them made like what what my my rubbish ideas are um I think that's probably my end game whoa okay that was that was a lot going on the screen for one for one soul that was quite a lot there is a waste on up ahead I don't think it's a good one Haggis and nips and ties do you also live in a lone terror up on some hill are you wait oh no is this an enemy dog no it's a nice dog hello I've been hunting and fishing in these parts for years I've been hunting and fishing in these parts for years are you telling me my lore story is shrek right now you can buy dragon scale you've not got the money for it all right veal or drinks it may or may not contain something unique to the girls I see that skiver on the road don't think I can't see you oh so captured that that is the noise I like to hear honestly I believe there's a few skeletons up on this hill but again nothing we can't handle nothing you can't handle at all um as I said we're gonna do the main quest we're gonna do the thieves um and then hello are you you are definitely an enemy oh I do beg your pardon but it's all the way absolutely nothing around these parts and another soul capture do you have soul gem spark white cat um we'll destroy those oh oh oh how dare you do you oh wait I think that ancient that ancient bow is stronger than what we have for our bow um right we're skeleton scare ooh scary are you squid me right by the pope I don't like my family history every time I read my family history I always have to ask myself are we the bad guys thank you for the tip I think my family history is like really boring it's just like yeah Scottish and Irish I know that you can do like 23 and me tests to like really see where you come from but I actually don't uh I don't believe it's safe at all to like willingly hand over your DNA like that look I know I'm starting to send like needy streamer overload where we're doing like that god speed run where she you know she got into like all the conspiracy theories and stuff but it's not really a conspiracy theory right I like maybe I should do a stream like that unironically I'll like yeah um wait what are you attacking you're not attacking me no you're not okay that's strange uh the scaly sounded like an oblivion scaly at least you got a cool accent out of the deal yeah and we are just running our way over to mvark said I believe is the town name of where you kind of forgot the pronunciation um nah I don't think it's safe either type your DNA on fail the company yeah like um I took like ethics class um and we were discussing like how good like emerging technology is like if you haven't heard about crisper is DNA fixing technology essentially DNA fixing um it's going through a lot of lab studies and trials and all that but it's found very effective against like um you know things that were previously incurable essentially or diseases that are uh untreatable that kind of thing um and the technology that can be raised from it um to help people is outstanding however do we do we trust such do we trust your DNA sequence to be handled with care or would in theory insurance help I'm sorry I'm literally hell yeah I'm up for scotland conspiracy theory stream thank you so much totally not Virginia um like I could definitely get into it but we were like talking about like uh didn't see one of the industry companies get caught selling all the data they said they wouldn't is that yes uh not to mention um there's like a whole rabbit hole about what data leaks are um because um I don't know I don't know if you guys care but um there's actually a whole other conspiracy um that data leaks aren't actually like that it's kind of more like government demands to have access but they already kind of have access so a lot of things especially with the technology in the state age but uh maybe I shouldn't go too far down the rabbit hole don't want to deter anyone where the heck am I supposed to go I think there's a path ahead I'll just follow this path um I thought we were going down the designer baby route oh well that already happened one of the biggest examples of the designer baby route was victoria beckham's children you're telling me that brown eyed lady has a 25 percent of uh blue eyed offspring and she just happened to pop out to blue eyed children uh no she did what is called ivf and then the dna tested and checked if the children and in the egg in the egg yes in the egg uh were able to uh had the recessive blue eyes it has already been done in this day and age and that was back in 2005 or something crazy it's one of the biggest public uh things that are right in the faces of people that you wouldn't know about it's already occurring today this also occurs with the fox p12 gene I believe I'm so sorry if no one cares about this but I'll try and get through it really quickly there's also a gene that's been identified called the fox p12 I believe um and if you have it it means you're actually a lot smarter and able to pick up things a lot easier than someone who is without this gene and it's been called into question that IVF babies may also be getting tested for this so you have a child or offspring that may be a bit smarter than the average girl but that's just on me okay uh I'll just leave it I'll leave it there but there there's a lot there's a lot okay um it's really interesting to continue the happen yes so a lot of people think it hasn't already occurred or the first human hasn't been cloned and dolly the first sheep was cloned in 1964 I believe uh the no no no no no that's when we first were publicly allowed to be learned and to be taught about the cloning um it's already happened long ago you just don't get to know about it because ethnically it's messed ethnically ethically it's messed up and the public shouldn't really be allowed to access this knowledge because well it brings up a lot of questions such as if you clone a person do they have one soul do they share soul and then it brings religion into question if you didn't know religion also helps bring in a lot of order into people's and communities lives and the rabbit hole goes incredibly deep but we can't touch on that subject too much because I'm just a vtuber playing skyrim right now and we're just trying to get to everything so we can talk to the greybeards to learn about our true powers the dragonborn as we play this game so yes please don't mind me uh oh there's a saber cat after me my goodness um but yes uh please uh please let us enjoy skyrim for what it is but anyway that's why I don't really start talking about these subjects uh because uh yeah it's uh it's a bit scary it's a bit scary when you look into it yeah right uh yeah gamers for genetically engineered cat girls represent absolutely I'm 100% there with you the fact that nickel girls aren't real I used to right this sounds really bad I used to actually fantasize about owning a nickel girl I don't know why I just I used to fantasize about like treating her really well and like she would have had a previous owner before me or something but I'll be like I'll treat you right baby I don't know why I give me like some sort of like superior like saving complex or something I don't know why but like I just oh I used to fantasize about all of that like especially after watching monster monster um I used to like really uh there should be a quest where you deliver something for someone is it you here for work get an axe and bring me all the wood you can chop oh okay right sorry jeez um if this dream doesn't demonstrate that the Tism is strong and veiler literally tiffin box there's someone that gives you a quest oh the graybeards 10 not well it's trouble is my legs aren't okay we're gonna yet if you talk to this guy you can do a quest for him um there's also a hidden thing if you read all of these on the way up something happens but I've completely forgotten what happens because I've never done it before because I saw it in a video and I've forgotten what happened in the video uh right let's see emblem one before the birth of men the dragons ruled all of montus their words their word was the voice and they spoke only for true needs for the voice could blot out the sky and flood the land well four years means more years to peace honestly what neko para does to mf for me honestly damn strony the last 10 minutes rumbles deaf and i'm so sorry thank you hypno mama thank you for apologize just saying cloning has never been perfect and there has been a growth in mental health issues as time has gone on we are all clones of our grandfathers grandmothers but imperfect oh thank you tharia for the tip i could talk about um so you know how like the older generations thing is like oh the lead paint stair because they'd been exposed to lead so much um my freaking biggest thing is that they've known about micro plastics forever and uh i actually got proven right it has been supra wait did i miss an emblem no i didn't hello how are you keep an eye out for wolves you need something i did he's so cold yeah maybe because your arms are out and you have your stomach is out and i can see your nip noop like of course you're cold right let's read emblem two oh emblem men were born and spread over the face did i thank those tips thank you frosty you know thank you tharia uh yeah micro plastics are today's lead plane apparently they're in the skin of men uh or i read something about it being in the skin of men i don't know if it's true or not or if i got trolled i believe anything i read men are born and spread over the face of mondes the dragons president over the crawling masses men were weak then and had no voice there is something about men's skin having micro plastics in it or something to do with their dingle whoppers uh you got you got plastic in your dingle whopper right now please be honest is it have you have you heard about this is this true can you confirm you sent me a picture usually like marshmallow thank you average strawny stream yep yep yep oh look shiny thing yep yep honestly some someone sent me a marshmallow and they were like i know your streams you get really excited but if i put you on a low enough volume your rambling puts me to sleep because it just goes everywhere my brain can't keep up i was like oh i'm so glad you like it and there's like as long as i like the note of like as long as i put you down low enough because i get really excited at random stages um actually i'm just gonna leave my weapon out you know but look at badass we look oh actually we're gonna get nicer armor soon because this armor is is leilig young uh like your mother your mother leilig yeah i'll should leave okay please be emblem three so i haven't missed anything uh i don't know how to give nothing emblem three the fledging spirit of men were strong in old times unafraid to war with unafraid to war with dragons and their voice but the dragons only shouted them down and broke their hearts random Netherlands uh yeah thank you well thank you well for uh listening to my random Dutch if i recall correctly all the men they tested had microplastic in their yeah so my my biggest thing i'm on right now is that they knew about microplastics years ago uh and all in the name of capitalistic profits uh they let us all get poisoned but that's just me anyway if anyone's wondering why i really like need to shoot my overload and that one particular uh achievement uh that one particular route you could take hmm i wonder why uh but yeah uh i uh came across a documentary where the woman actually submitted because she did find it and she got laughed at the company and yeah that was like 20 years ago but it's been known for it's been known from the start so it's very very she cares about our boss yes please if you are a man listen to me right now i cut oh wait hold on i command you to eat tomatoes i'm not being funny tomatoes are the best thing you can do for your boss thank you for listening to my rant uh i'm so serious oh

one i think it may be the horn one you know hold on let me check it is retrieves a horn now we can ignore that and go and do the thief's guild which is much more exciting in my humble opinion so let's go all the way doing this hell and we'll finish this little miscellaneous and then we'll go to the thief's guild no no no no no no no no no no no no i get so annoyed with these guys because they always end up killing npcs you need to drag the cultists out of any environment because they always kill npcs and you can't resurrect the freaking thing so you need to wait until they come and attack you get ready prepare yourself they're so annoying you there you're the one they call dragonborn yeah the graybeards yes i am you are but he's shadow lord miran right right lidia lidia please do not kill any of the guards i'm gonna be so annoyed yeah yeah yeah yeah perish super okay lidia got smacked up but she's okay that's good we'll take that oh oh what do you can i destroy oh i can destroy these for uh a level up i'll i'll take that i'll take that oh look at that i'll take that but mind if i do yes i am dragonborn actually funny you mentioned that and passing i'm actually the dragonborn you're the hey yeah we got the DLCs too whoa i don't want to what time is it oh wake up wake up that actually really hurt my hands i don't know if you heard me smack my bone on the table to try and make that noise is this a fresh run it is we're just gonna be doing the best quests which is the main quest and thieves guild and then because i completely messed up like a dum dum dummy dum dum dum i delivered the supplies wasn't it it was anyway much appreciated here take this for your troubles thank you uh oh i got 500 coin honestly that's decent we're gonna pick up ninroot because i'm pretty sure there's a ninroot quest that'll air date right we're gonna check the map and we're gonna go directly east because that is where DLC to oh my god cute fragile girl bro i could hardly open those freaking cans of fizzies yesterday i was actually getting embarrassed and then i couldn't even open up the kisses either i was like freaking straining for my life thankfully my my sweaty hands came in clutch when i came to the crisps uh oh excuse me just going for a swim casually a 500 quid is like literally so good honestly that's like such a big booster start in the game uh right redmond's hall i don't like the sound of that and we are just gonna try and discover the landmarks on the way oh wait we can can we just use our yeah okay we can just use our ultimate to get a bit faster the cultists are from myriac still see uh i don't like that one we can maybe do vampire questline as well vampire thieves guild and main quests where the storm cloaks win in the end yes please i think i will be very satisfied with their skyrim adventures doing that clear cut and we're not kind of stuck with the hill come on there we go uh that definitely because they're freaking actually that's another thing uh toad why make a serena in the first place if i can't marry her like i'm not being funny but probably one of the best characters please leave me alone i don't want any trouble okay i'm just passing through um but that's done their amazing side quest honestly you should always pick ninroo it's the only plant that is limited in the game oh are you gonna do the assassin guys quest the dark brotherhood actually i really enjoy the dark brotherhood we may end up doing that as well as a sweet mother sweet mother send your child unto me for the sins of the unworthy must be baptized in blood and fear i remember watching that for the first time and just being blown away like i loved everything about her i'm such an edgy little child such an edgy little beast um so i didn't want players to

couldn't have made it any worse if i tried trying to do some scuma oh my god would you do scuma with me at the next convention have the next vtuber convention let's just scuma i don't even know what it's supposed to do or mimic i think it's supposed to maybe mimic um barrel bine um yeah because everyone seems zonked out barrel bine makes you very um sedated in nature we're right rifton there's a wolf below me again i'm just decimating the wolf population honestly skyrim's just scotland before they eradicated the world she can't convince me otherwise like right i'm pretty sure if we discover yeah this is the first um thieves thing farted and almost dies from fall damage 10 out of 10 far actually i haven't been in chibi stream i'ma go over there for the first time yeah give it give my genmeys a shout a shout give them a shot um they're absolutely fantastic in their own special way um if you like burps chibi's your gal um i feel like bright little sisters emi's your gal if you like adorable brats that'll call you an old man and tease you and you can tease her back ac's your gal if you want to be babyed as soon as you're gal uh and if you want to be uh i don't know what would mercy's if you want to be uh if you want a jealous experience watch mercy and then i think someone described me as like the neighbor from next door that doesn't mean you placing your hand on a round object and i was like honestly yeah that's pretty good pretty good uh description yes there's chibi live if you'd like to have a have a chicken i don't know what game she's playing senpai to yander yeah azure called her bingbong oh like sph bros again looked after something chibi is talking yes you get before i let you into rift and yeah yeah visitors text how about we do a little persuasion for the privilege of entering the city this is obviously a shakedown keep your voice down my speech is 22 i don't know about you my speech is 22 there she is this is the person i normally wife but then again i become the head of the thieves guild and she absolutely despises it you're not from rift my travels have taken me from moral wind at all points in between why are you here then many years ago i lost my you and i see grimm's week so with um oh this guy shakes his down as well um i'm i'm just passing i'm not scared of you that's the wrong answer last thing the black briars need around here is some troublemaker trying to steal a piece of the action who are the black briars have ripped it in their pocket and the thieves guild watching their back so keep your nose out of their business why are you tell me all this for free i'm maul i watch the streets for them if you need dirt on anything i'm your guy but it'll cost you you're just begging for a pagan aren't you i'm sorry i don't know why i said that my persuasion check failed eat eat i'm really getting tired of your excuses yeah like everyone uh it's like okay this is the start of honest day's working in life for all that but everyone wants to talk to you at once when you enter rift and i have to admit it's a bit of a sensory bit of a cheeky sensory overload entering in your city and skyrim everyone wants to talk to you right uh how could you possibly know that i'm a thief right i'm gonna tell you something you should absolutely not do maybe you'd like a taste the game is going to ask you to plan a ring on this person and it locks him up in jail and removes um a seller from rifting don't do it don't do it okay if you do it it removes him as a seller and it's like another 800 coins you can't get from selling stuff these symbols you see around the city um these are thieves guild symbols you'll see them everywhere it means this place has been marked or there's something of value inside like you'll see the symbols everywhere and you always want to fail this quest it doesn't matter if you feel that you still get to become a part of the thieves guild um oh he's not started his dialogue clearly because uh that should have done it why am i being told to join the rebellion i didn't do anything oh come on hurry up oh freaking the sick after that dialogue actually run out um hello you're having some problems with uh that thief skilled person what do you want what kind of trouble are you in i owe a great deal of money to someone and i think tell me the details the stables and white run to sell me some of their tack and harnesses i borrowed some gold from i hate that you can't just skip the initial quest honestly no no i'm a murderer who will not be big difference man and if i don't pay her shiny as the whole pack is replaying what i'll help you pay off your debt speak to sapphire about shaders debt a voice in your head told you that there's so many sellers in rifting there are but if you want quick access oh for goodness sake bring y'all wrap it up buddy like this is getting really just me i look kind of badass i am lydia the right hand of the thing of white run oh come on me just fail it so we can start the thieves quest he's a jeweler too yeah definitely especially when you're level up your um speech you can sell to like anyone which is so good rest well see you in the morning when you wake up we're not even started the thieves quest come on i'll discover this building because i've not discovered it oh come on fail it okay that looks like i failed it surely not the coughing it is anyone even doing anything bring y'all no one is talking or interacting when i'm done here i'd be more than happy to sell you an elixir you must be all right if you've got time to come i haven't rub on xbox it's not this broken just what you see here what's he got for sale he's got 700 coins so we can actually empty our inventory with him a little bit uh don't want to get too heavy uh we don't really need any of that just uh get rid of it all why not oh who's burping who goes there identify yourself okay i don't think i can destroy a staff but oh my god this come on good old scum right if he's not gonna let me fail that i'll move on to um austin grav a bit of austin gravie hey in the micro wavy did he purchase dragon skills from you yeah he did you can pretty much convince him to do whatever especially um one of the speech perks is actually having being able to sell at any point shawnee you have her bore swords and her shields and you have my clock whoa oh ninroo i hear it tada there's a quest inside uh black reach which is um i just realized this giant can fly me halfway across the map so i should probably be a bit more careful um hey how's shawnee going chilling in my family's living room watching lol it's going good um we're just trying to fail the thieves guild quest so we are purposely is there a moth in my room hold on i'm about to scream is there a moth am i being pranked i think my eyeballs are pranking me okay i think i'm okay okay i'm okay i'm safe um what was i saying um we're just going to continue the dragon born quest line at the moment because we're trying to freaking get the uh why are you attacking me i didn't do anything well you started it's i'm i'm i'mma end it i love how fast like they fall back so no no don't don't try and escape you started it you uh right i'm not actually didn't fight here we'll just go skip ahead it said it's already failed wait because i moved away oh you stinking game you honestly right we'll do the thieves guild thing uh wait does it even you can't fast travel while there's oh you know what this game such a troll sometimes can i like hate from them can they even see me come on i'm gonna end up activating a mud crab and then i won't be able to like fly away oh look this shouldn't burn arrows at me from here it's quite the distance honestly this one is like bobby bee caving in our man's breastplate with a single swing of the hammer uh heck yeah who's bobby be bobby be bobby be um to save time you're best going to the mestaville creep just to save a few perishes where the heck why right take everything else off we're doing this quest only bring you off i literally had to teleport away and didn't be annoyed just how long did you expect me to keep those people distracted why are you going in here you don't sorry i'm he doesn't live in here you caught me at a bad time lost someone yeah my organization's been having a run of bad luck but i suppose that's just how it

our engulf sold golden glow he has no idea the extent if only the parchment had the buyers last but for now you're off to speak them even black prior she asked for you by name it's just business that's but right we're just basically going to speak to the person who is hand in hand with the thieves girl and she oh also if you ever need arrows for free literally it genuinely spawns and like I'm very good golf clap tomato tomato tomato boo stop doing that uh we will take a pee break very shortly because our purple ladders will be bursting for those of you who actually do hydrate and for those of us who forget to hydrate you're just feeling a little bit tired because we need some food in the system good for the boys bad for the julia whereas she's upstairs what's your problem yeah what's your hello maven bright bar confidence i hear or is that arrogant strange i'm often like confused yeah yeah yeah yeah right she's gonna tell us to go do a quest where we manipulate um a competitor to her brewery look for malice mark yes um which is quite a unique one because of what goes on inside the quest quick question is our way to get into the these girl treasury not that i know of um other than doing the quest line where it opens up and then it reveals uh and then it the big root wait what oh it's been reflux need more honestly should i call a break should we do it wait hold on let me let me finish my water oh uh that was tap water yeah i'm not really fat atop war yeah when i have it in tea i guess it covers up all the flavor i work with my mother to sell first time vegetable that anyone are you okay i know it's scary i know it's scary to go into a new place for the first time but you'll be all right and then you buddy just stop the fire take a seat and get the cold out oh my gosh i love it i love this game so much i'm gonna hello hello hello can't a man drink in peace jeez you look his eyes i've got like eye shadow on i'm gonna keep this so we're to basically poison the bat from a meadery in order to get this guy arrested it's pretty pretty yeah it's pretty deep plot i have to admit the plot is so deep like it's probably i'd say an average of five inches deep of this plot um shut up just shut up um i will make a tea and get some food in me because i think i'm starting to go slightly delirious because i've not had anything i'm supposed to be holding a tasting of the new hunting so if he sees the meadery in this state there's currently skeevers and at his meadery and we're gonna offer some well that's not how i operate so you better or i'll yell skeever okay okay no need to make rash decision here's half my only how do i permanent so he is literally handing us the poison that we're gonna poison the bat of mead with it's it's it's so evil i love it please eat get that nutrition you i just get so distracted when i stream like i don't oh fucking hell um i just uh oh sorry sorry i'm it's all a bit pear shaped hasn't it uh yeah i just like kind of forget to eat and stuff when i stream i just get so distracted because it's like such a good time i've always been like oh my gosh oh all right i'm on the red oh you can't even see my health bar oh wow my health bar is really bad right now uh i'll show you how bad it is i can i can heal right now that's how bad it oh maybe i need to adjust my chat so it doesn't go over the screen especially for video games like this i might get that change uh spaking the honeybrew mead with emmy needs honestly emmy needs delightfully did emmy would cry for it it's not bad you're no hit legendary i am okay hold on lidia you lidia lidia you literally went around the room what do you mean by over the screen so you see how like next to me is that little cuttlefish to my to your left i guess from your pop see how the chat is like going up on screen from that chat box i might change it so it doesn't so the video game isn't um like encroached in any way because i just noticed now that you can't see my health bar um you can see my stamina constantly but my big hairs oh oh sorry there's traps sorry sorry oh sorry sorry oh oh lidia lidia there's traps like did you not just hear me jump over them lidia oh right this fight always scares me because this guy is actually super OP for no reason there's a man in here oh we need to we need to get him first because i have like no magic oh bruv bruv hold on all right i'll get the rats first he is like so strong for no reason and he freaking does that where he fucking backs off i hate when you back off when you're fighting them like i know that's normal to back off when someone's like coming at you but it's so annoying just stand still and let me parachute it's like not that big a deal yeah so that man was currently living with the the skevers um you know as long as he's happy and thriving that's the main thing but uh no a little to the right no no a little to the left a bit more no a little bit more to the left oh he's a mage yeah we hate mages honestly there's so annoying male version of ime oh i mean ow i keep getting wrecked by these traps like i've like forgotten them all right we'll finish this quest and then i will get some food in me because i'm probably moments from perishing uh you can just grab this key but here by the way super easy um um i totally didn't know that on my first playthrough and walked all the way back uh like a dumb dumb no i don't want to steal from it it's honestly kind of picking up stolen items is really annoying if the guards end up picking you up right we've done it we've done the quest once we finish we'll take a look if you need to sample some of the finest mead in skyline that your shift hasn't even started yet when i'm hello well it's about time you'll just have to wait until after the camp right we're gonna watch it all we're gonna watch it all in furl lydia go take a seat there lydia go sit lydia sit what do you need go sit okay got it well now that you've taken care of your i said go sit you're ruining the view lydia even though you look just like me it's my finest room yet i call it the hate game from 2011 are you planning on playing the elton ring dlc yeah we're you when it comes out we're replaying the full game again and the dlc on pop i have no idea how big the dlc is it's probably gonna be a week of elden ring so i do apologize to anyone who hates elton ring i will probably have like a shorter stream and maybe do like a membership stream as well and switch it up maybe she doesn't like to be told sit she's not a good girl bad girl i don't understand silence idiot

word that you discovered then this has been someone's trying to take us down oh someone's trying to take the thieves killed down and it's not us i've never seen him this before complete dump why did the color palette just shift there i could do i blink and you'll miss it honestly here comes airplane i found the same marking at the honey broom eatery you admire them just don't mistake how can we make them pay name is gullama gullama i'm betty get out there shake him down shake him down shake him down uh i need to talk to brinjalph again hi brinjalph i can't believe gullama is mixed up in all this gullama not to be confused with golem a don't get me wrong you could scam a beggar how about i recite the work even more and oh i reduced the work even more and chew it for me do you know that's how um used to food babies back in the day um it's actually really common for the mums to chew the food and then give it to the um sorry um yeah so like before baby formula was a thing and like solid food training or whatever like before the again a capitalism market kind of exploded went to hear about what nesli did um yeah it was like really common your mom chose the food for you and then gives it to you in your mouth it's like a little baby bird moment and everyone's like that's so gross and i was like bro that's the way it is it's just like how how it be you know it's very interesting i actually could probably write an entire video i say about it and then present that video i say live on stream and just to show everyone how natural things are but everything's been so like oh they're so weird but it's only weird because we've not been exposed and we no longer even talk about it because it's like literally unironically being bred out of us over a few generations because capitalism is away um what one fun world stroney did you consider getting mana as backup food yeah mummy bird and literally i didn't know that was a thing it is so um uh babies newborns should start on breast milk because it's full of colostrum um and it's also because a baby doesn't actually have an immune system until six months old um so it's very important to have breast milk however um it was very common to have what's called a wet nurse which is when um a woman who had recently had a child uh would share um because it's very common for some women to experience a surplus and it's very common for some women to experience uh problems producing milk it's just kind of random doesn't really there's a lot of factors that come into play um obviously stress is a major one stress on any human body for a long period do you mind i'm telling a story about tiddy milk leave me alone um but yes uh i'm sure as a lot of you can imagine being stressed for a very long time is very bad for your health um guys uh guys uh stress manifests in a lot of mental health issues and a lot of loneliness um um oh are we gonna make it you know what we're gonna send it send it right hold on hold on let them fake them out a little fake them out fake them out fake them out it's fine wow wait wrong one oh shit i'm out of stamina and he's like right next to me this is rather embarrassing i have to admit uh i didn't really think this far through yeah stress got me pretty good yeah i like it here because i learned so much information okay there we go we can get away worse i hear it i don't see it i think that's good that i don't see it though because it means it's not near me don't call me out like that yeah it's very um interest in the way it physically manifests in the way like obviously i think the majority of us have been like raised in a western society which obviously comes with a lot of socialization and socialization plays so much into the how you can deal with stress factors and like it's just kind of a sad fact that like homeboys uh kind of get told to suck it up um like i can literally go greeting to the girls right now and it's like nothing nothing's wrong with it or anything um but it's very interesting how you tackle it i don't even know how you tackle it i wouldn't even have a clue where you start like the only thing i guess you could hope for is pockets of communities and over time ideas get popular like um when the general consensus of society changes that's when the real change comes through but the problem is you have to basically go out with the old and how do you go out with the old well the the old passes away the old doesn't bring down it bring down the old doesn't pass on its teachings like for example um i like my grandparents talked about how they got hit by their parents um it was a very common place to be hit if you didn't know it's actually illegal to punish your child via a corporal punishment yes your own child in scotland is legal and you will be prosecuted for hitting them no it is not punishment no it is not spanking no it is literally against the law you're welcome to go up and it's very bad for the child there's a lot of things done around it um but it's very fascinating um how quickly things can change within a generation so my grandparents told me stories about them getting hit by their parents they did not hit my parents like they didn't hit mom and dad and then you know opposites i didn't hit mom and dad and mom or dad so my mom spanked me so my dad never hit me he doesn't like it he doesn't believe in it and he absolutely despises it my mom so there was this orange slipper and she used to hit me with it all the time because it was such a low child um but it's very interesting because um within a couple of generations in scotland it's a big no no to discipline your children via punishment like that physical punishment um and it's just like interesting to see as the generations come and go like some people might not like the emphasis like oh if you're in this age range you're gen x if you're in this you're a zoomer you're this you're that but the reason it is so purposeful and so important to have these names for generations is because there's also a lot of societal behaviors that emerge i hear nin root i hear it yes um and uh so like you who are listening to me right now odds are we were not raised in the exact same society with the expectations and whatever's however we are crazy enough to have the ability to set up a community like main where we may agree on how things like should go and how things shouldn't go and we have created a pocket a pocket of a collective that can provide secondary socialization which is crazy because primary socialization is your parents but secondary is like outside outside influence and i could influence you to see the world differently through my words which is like insane um even we might not even be in the same generation and it's just as freaking socialization is fantastic stuff i will also probably write a massive stream essay i would love to talk about all this stuff in higher detail but right now we're about to do the thieves quest and i've forgotten again to get food but that's okay we're just gonna sneak on in that's right you're being educated and you're well uh against you well get educated get educated get educated strongy feeding us knowledge we'll forget to feed herself honestly are you sweating me right now by the pope strongy sorry for interrupting but would you kindly get food and tea okay yes i will thank you um penitent i get penitent i've said penitent with no teas do you become pen in it pen penny ten penny ten penny and penny in thanks for the time sorry i'm having a stroke because you've got teas in your name i will quickly go grab some food and go for a pee i highly recommend everyone who's listening to please go get some water go get some tea this is an endurance stream so we're gonna be here for a little while we're gonna finish the thieves quest and then we're gonna do dark brotherhood and then we're gonna do vampire quest line because i enjoy it very much stop your knowledge it's too big oh yeah you can't handle my knowledge take more take more take more um but yes please get up and stretch your legs please get some more hydration i'm gonna get a cup of tea some water i might even get a cola i'm feeling so naughty to get cola so please do get your legs a stretch and yes and analyze the color of your yes manifest too dark then you need to hydrate more okay get in food get in food get in food honestly you can't force the knowledge on me is it really forcing if you want it though hmm did i did i tell you that whenever i make a i guess like forbidden knowledge whenever i make an audio where i'm very our word um people really enjoy that so i just let you should know it seems to be a thing though that like anyway uh i'm literally standing up swiveling on my chair i will be back uh give me like four minutes to pee and a cup of tea and heat up my Liz Hagney like two minutes in the microwave sounds about right i think but yeah i'll be back in a minute okay so What shenanigans did you get up to whilst I took a big fat Joby? Okay, I've got food, lads she's been gone for 84 years, I've not, I've not, I've been good. Like, none of it's true. I got cola, I got a tea and I got food, I'm so happy. A what now? Like, all I'm saying is the kettle was boiled and the microwave had microwaved, okay. We talked about the happening. She's back, I am back. And I have food, a nice tab out and look at marshmallows or is this gonna break the game? Wouldn't that be hilarious if it broke the game and I had to redo it all over it then? Oh my god that would be so funny, please don't do that. Where's my mouse? Got this? Okay, we're back. How do I open up marshmallow? We're just gonna be stuffing our faces for a couple of minutes so I'll read marshmallow. The toes, the toes from the stream the other day hit all the right spots, thank you so much for caring to your people's desires. I had quite a bit of spicy time, can't wait to see more of those toesies, oh you'll be excited for tomorrow's stream, oh my god, oh that's funny as anything. I want to him in your curls, my curls, my curled toes? Wow, when you tape you keep your hand on the WASD keys, you're a true gamer, typical people keep it ASDF, do they have that WASD? Oh my god, I can't believe it, I'm a nerd, you've caught me. You have the most beautiful tiny hands in the world, yeah some people said my hands were small, I'm not, I don't actually, I think my hands are the average size for a Whammon, I thought, I don't even think funny, I actually thought I was like bang on average for everything, but I guess I'm not and I'm actually on the smaller side, they are tiny, oh okay, like when I got the ruler out, oh sorry I just punched the microphone, when I got the ruler out I thought that was really fun because everyone can kinda, WASD is natural hand position, yeah I definitely agree with that, mm-hmm, God you have no idea how badly I want to hold my hand, I should come to a convention then, I'll have, I'll get a body guard just to make sure everything's all above ground, but yeah I can bring all damn things, I don't know, I feel like if someone comes to a convention to come see you, I like the idol meetings, like the Japanese idol meetings where they hold your hand and you can talk and look at each other over the table type thing, I think that's really sweet and cute, but I don't know, I don't know, it just seems like something, I dunno, it's just me, mm-hmm, the ASMR booth if only, I wish a convention would entertain me to do that, that's honestly ridiculous, make sure everything's above the table honestly, who would get in trouble first, me or you, me or everyone, let me analyze this one, hey Strony, is there any chance for a hypnosis with helping the listener with addiction or focusing desires upon yourself from distractions, um, oh I'm not sure I can do stuff like that, mine is always of an alternative nature for grat of the defying nature, I absolutely am not qualified or capable or doing anything that kind of has like a, I don't know what the word is, but like I, therapeutic, yeah I would say any therapeutic hypnosis I can't participate in because I don't actually have the knowledge on who goes there, how to do it safely, so safety first I will admit this is out of my league, I am definitely not there and I don't think I ever will be there, um 10 out of 10, 9 out of 10, holy moly, oh yeah, oh did you forget when I eat I burp even more, that's right, the air gets trapped in these lungs, eh lungs in this stomach, I gave you my tribute cherry and no one else, you're the only woman to ever, ah these are supposed to be special, I have a mindset in the first place, oh I don't ever feel like forced to or anything, but I do like that, I took your cherry, hi Strony, just finished watching your sweet stream and I have to say those sweets are not as sweet as you, those sweets aren't as sweet as you, hey, oh okay we'll give you that one, that was cute, okay that was cute, every journal joke I know though, also did you know that the bumps on the F and J keys on your keyboard are there so you can correctly place your hands fingers on them without looking or touching, I thought the WASD was funny, I didn't know that, you have taught me knowledge, everyone please finger the F key and notice the bump on the F that is for positioning reasons, and in light of recent events the girls have made it clear they don't want our unfaithful scene, even with your permission if they are reciprocal and dedication, I am happy for them and happy to oblige their wishes, however this means your king will be ignored, my sharing, I'm trying to navigate this in a particular way, I think we all know, I'm trying to get around it, I will just have to, I will have to, I can't say anything, my tentacle is no once again for your exquisite news, oh I love that and only, I can't read anything else over that, there we go finger in the F, yes mmm yes, my sea queen, my sea queen yes, they can entertain my sea queen due to the girls preference, yes oh my god my pc, I don't know if it's because it's on standby but it's making the room unbelievably hot, hi cuddles, during this stream this morning you ask what a fumu was in response to my comment about some plushies, they're basically smug plushies of popular characters from the two whole series, however they have developed a bit of a cult following due to memes and such and ended up with people making their own similar plushies like the Neurosam and Evil Neurosam, oh okay okay from Makership, ah yeah yeah yes I see, I see thank you, am I too big for you, oh that's that's a link, that's a link, we'll investigate that later on, hi Strony, thanks for the fun stream today, a lot of the American sweets did not look safe to eat well but I'm glad you found a new thing you'd like, yeah Makin' Eggs, orange flavor, I'm all about that, I'm all about the Makin' Eggs, I've always had a keen interest in hypno content, I'm very very curious to experience what you have to offer and even more intrigued by the idea of permanent info and I do have a reverse audio that will be publicly accessible, please don't worry, I've always thought that hypnosis would never work on me and I'd like to give it a try, literally you, if it's not for you that's more than okay, I do offer like alternative like audios and stuff that aren't that theme but if it's not for you please don't ever feel forced to like go along with it if that makes sense, like either it's for you, you can give it a try, if you're open minded you'll see, will you give us your best sometime, also you're quite, oh my god I'm choking on my lasagna, you can hear it slide down my throat, also you're quite literally the cutest cop fish I've ever seen, thank you, you make me feel a certain kind of way with that voice of yours, oh yeah yeah, like this, top, why do I say top of the morning, is this one not scott's, good morning, good evening, good afternoon, right today we're playing Skyrim, that's right, Skyrim belongs to the north, oh someone says it, someone says I never thought I'd be too big for my beloved, I don't know how to handle this information, pick the other hole, it's really not that, it's not that hard, actually I encourage you very much, please don't worry, I will, I will teach you the ways in the membership stream, I love your content, hope to see more, I'm in the process of making a short story for you, but now that I'm halfway done with it, I'm on the verge of scrapping it, no, pure shame, no, if you ever, if ever saw the late day, I would need a new identity, it's not even explicit, I use very loose words, but yeah maybe I shouldn't have brought it up, oh don't be scared to put your creations into the, are you joking me, you know all the scripts that you've heard from the girls so far, I wrote that, do you think I was proud of the first thing I ever wrote, no, don't scrap it, let me read it, I want to read, I'm eating cauliflower that's coated in flavour, hmm, um, I'm so sorry, hi scrawny ass in the stream, but looks like it's in past chat, what's the model of your keyboard, uh, uh, Corsair, something, I think it's the, it's the Australian version because the number two is the at key, which is actually the wrong key in the UK, this is delicious, this is exactly what I need to stream for 12 hours, hey scrawny, just want to say I'm glad that Vealer is up and running, um, I've been following since another life and really enjoyed her refresh and your content is, that's because I'm unprofessional, so happy to see your dreams come into life and bring in the V-trip and, flash-trip and re-re-e together, I feel like what you're doing is really breaking out in your character, oh shucks, you stop that, you're, you're, you're blowing, smoke up my arse, I am getting my ego stroke so hard, what's going on here, um, new character, I'd love to see it, can't wait to watch you all in the rest of the years to come, you stop that, I hope they all continue to achieve their dreams, I do too, my next goal, once everyone, who goes there, once everyone is monetized, um, we will get, um, my next goal is to get them all to 5k subscribers because we have a celebratory artwork for that when everyone achieves it, so I'm very excited, oh, it has to be there forever, me who has to think of the second, uh, video game for Gen2, MonkaS, I don't even know if anyone's going to like my idea, but here we go, hi strongy, that's just someone's measurements, 13 centimeters, okay, 17, all right, that's the reflens, what's going on, you all filed for those ads that were like, take this pill, so wonderful to see you and the other girls flourishing post debut, here's the great and healthy future, hopefully it's the shiny and pearlescent, as your outfit is strongy, big love, thank you so much, big love, everything, that's a link, so, uh, can't, can't, uh, look at that, um, hey, hey, and under this color, I know you like whimpering, there you are, who told you that, but what should you take on talking during gifts, example calling you a good, be sucky, the best little, if you want to do that, go for it, yeah, oh my, yeah, if you want to say that stuff, go for it, I ain't gonna say no, hey, strongy, I'm a skit, so refling, oh, bless your heart, are you okay, son, is there any way to retract my mod application, oh, if you get picked for a mod, don't worry, you can just reject it at any point, if you get that offer, oh, bless, yeah, I hope you're okay, but I don't trust myself with that kind of power, that's really good on you to, uh, be able to see that maybe it's not the best idea for you, good on you, skit, so refling, god, the way, it's just, it's how direct you identified yourself that was kind of humorous, sorry, I do apologize, I'm not laughing at you, I actually just found it, just like, hey, I'm skit, so refling, like, you just, you just, like, slammed your boars on the desk because of the, just like, yeah, let's get straight to the point, um, so sorry, that was rather humorous the way you wrote that, yes, please just reject the offer, if you do get messaged about it, I actually have no idea, uh, mommy, please, I wanna, hmm, while listening to you, hmm, hi, Strani, I just wanna say thank you, thank you so much, Reeler, I'm really, really happy you're back, but I'm also happy for the other girls too, I am too, they're also sweet and talented, oh, I know they are, absolutely adore them, I can't read that one out loud because that's very, that's very, uh, maybe in a membership room, I tried suggesting another man to make you his new Oshi because he was an old-school runescape addict, when he's out of the picture, I'll swoop in on his wife, not that I'm trying, well, what, what are you saying, you're trying to get, what, you're trying to get me an old-school runescape sugar daddy, I've, none of you have seen the runescape series so far, there's just one installment, oh, shit, management just showed up, everyone front and center, I, I, I'm serious, you can also contact the website and mention the email you used in the mod application to get it removed, okay, yeah, that seems fair, um, uh, what was I saying, oh yeah, I literally have like 22 million gp and all I did was show up in freaking fish, hi cuddles, I'm currently watching the mod of today's ace marstream since I missed it while sleeping, I'm someone who has never been able to go under despite having a, having a flavor for it, so, one issue I have that I become, hysterical, I can't read that, um, uh, uh-huh, okay, okay, we have quite an effect on this replay, that's adorable, I like that, I'm managing with quick hands above desk honestly, hi, I love you mom, I love you to everything, the stream was incredible, I'm really glad that I interest you and I can't wait to see what you do next, also I'm still here and she'd be streamed for you, I'm devoted to you, I really want to send you something, but I haven't had the inspiration been really in my, my emotions lately and it's really slammed my libido, do I know a sad fact, my alternative picture is the last time, rip in the chat, I've been so freaking stressed like all the time and I can't like unstress myself, I think it'll calm down like once the thing but like I'm so freaking stressed and it's such a shame, but I'm sure I will get inspiration soon, I think maybe, I'll tell you what, I think maybe once the monetization for everyone has been achieved, I'll start to feel relaxed because like then truly is up to the girls, whatever they want to do and I can just get fun shorts ordered of them, but like right now I'm like, oh my god there's four out of six, why is the other two not come through because we applied for them all at the same time, like oh no weapons of one of the girls don't get YouTube monetization, oh no that's like a whole month and uh just like oh I don't, oh I would be sick if I think about it, we pretend we do not see, but yeah, the, what did I just say, there's a line of volunteers is extremely long, thank, yeah you guys want to make gentry right now? I've almost finished eating and then I will slurp my honey tea and then we'll get back into the thieves guild, Skyrim's going good, we're at um Gollum from the thieves guild quest, we're about to be meeting the big naughty on who's trying to take down the thieves guild soon to him and then once we do the thieves guild we are going to do the dark brotherhood because I actually really enjoy it, it's quite, I think the dark brotherhood is actually relatively quick um and then we're going to do the vampires and then if we still have time we're going to do um the actual dragonborn quest line which I hate doing because it breaks the game and if you ever like seriously want to do like a hundred percent speed run, eh speed run, not speed run, just a hundred percent achievements, always leave it last because it breaks the game so much when you have to like say like oh we'll give white run up or we'll give this uh rifting up or we'll do this or we'll do that, every detail of how much it breaks the game, but I finished my my bowl of lasagna, um now I've got my cup of tea and my cola, I do, I do, I've got my cola, no need to read this during a stream, oh yeah what happens if I do it right now the ASMR stream was amazing strongy, I was putting your hands during it, ah that's so cute hmm I'm giving you, oh whoa someone is giving me a step by step gate on how to do haptic feedback inalize, inalizing, okay that's the law links, um how down bad do you think is too down bad for you, for me, oh no I like, I like main corruption so there's not really a down too bad, I think corruption's really um up there um oh my first membership stream can be about that, no about ranking everything inalize, yes, oh strongy, I just want to thank you for giving all the girls a home and a family, Vila are such a positive part of the environment already and I'm happy to watch along with all the other reflins, oh reflin, I said also the latest patreon post is incredible, did you like it, I thought it was good, would you let me pick on your party yes if you are a patreon member um another audio has gone up so there's a total of three audios up, um it is spaced out for the other girls so because all the audios were uploaded on the first that did mean there's a bit of a break between the next one that comes up but as it stands everyone has a day, if I can remember correctly Azura, Monday, Mercy, Tuesday, um Emmy, Weddin's Day, Shebe, Thursday, AC, Friday, strongy, Saturday, I'm not quite sure but just so you understand they are purposefully spaced out who goes there and um they will be like every Tuesday all of X's will go out on every Tuesday all of like for me every Saturday an audio will come out like that kind of thing um we I'm going to get the girls to post on what's inside like with the tags and everything I just need catch up time um she says as she's sitting on Skyrim for an endurance stream I've got nothing but the cheek I really do I've got nothing but the cheek but I do need catch up time to get into the floor things then next month um 100% will be like you will see what's inside if you want to subscribe for that month or not and if not then you know you can take a look at whoever else is posting maybe they've got something a bit more up to your style again I would like to repeat when it comes to the audios I have not shoehorned anyone into the same type of plot if you will because that will not financially enable them to be the content creator they'd like to be um a lot of the girls are looking at moving out possibly if they're able to receive enough support so that's why I do say if you only have enough money to support one girl please do pick a daughter of mine because um they are gunning to move out um and it means they would provide more content and yeah it's just a very positive cycle occurs um yes uh yeah I'm both meanies like not bad just to kill it by emoji if you subscribe to everyone you get an audio every day I mean technically you're very close you get a rest day no one uploads on a sunday also they deserve it yes the girls work incredibly hard um AC was like am I allowed someone asked a question to AC on marshmallow like uh how do your recordings work and she was like am I allowed to talk about this and I'm like yeah you can as long as you don't see anything that's like NDA obvious then yeah you can talk about how I I burst into your DMs and hand you a script and all the spelling is wrong and the grammar's whack yeah you can talk about that all you like I say actual day of rest honestly um but yes thank you for thanking me for giving the girls a home but please understand the girls did it themselves they reached out to vealer they applied um they went to an interview and they were happy with everything some of them did the very thorough research uh Emmy actually was the most inquisitive and had the most questions Azura I think she was just like is any of this real I think she thought she was dreaming because she never asked a single question after the interview um yeah Azura was absolutely adorable Emmy asked a ton of questions which made me think she wasn't actually gonna accept the character because I told her what the character's theme was and I saw people were being weird but yeah Azura was like fuck it we ball NDA and the dogs did not withstand and they have carte blanche what carte blanche but what uh in English what in English English that's so Azura honestly yeah this one's like big mommy we ball honestly a free pass or it means like free reign oh carte blanche a blank menu is what the translation is that makes sense a free pass a blank menu oh my god I can't believe it sorry I translated it literally versus uh metaphor good uh hi sending messages scares me but I want I watched your ASMR stream and it was amazing I can't wait to see more of your stuff both ASMR and other videos they're so fantastic I'm watching you do what you love and making ASMR making via lure has me thinking I should start and follow my you should follow your own dreams you've only got one shot I keep snail blinking please Paul please don't notice me snail blinking you do you've only got one shot if you've got a dream or something you want to achieve where can go for it like if I win the lottery already know what I'm doing all I'm saying is if I win the lottery the girls are getting stacked out so I'm saying um you know the split going even higher you know oh it's always fun to try and reach for a new goal like for example hypnosis is my new goal I've always enjoyed it and always liked it but I've never made it myself because like I'm just like not skilled and I need to make sure it's safe and all that sorry I'm trying to wait there's a fucking cat hair on my face and it's one of those cat hairs where you wipe it away and then it does a 360 look back on wherever it's freaking a caption I'm so sorry that'll be gimley honestly um but you honestly you placed everyone in their spots so well I wouldn't picture anyone else yes there is right no I'm not gonna say it because I might start up some shitters um and we ain't stirring the pot from these parts we tap the sign from these parts um let's see hi strongy could you give us a hearing test like hearing test ASMR of course I can do something like that for ya you do a 360 and walk away wait a minute a 180 oops wait no 360 is the circle 180 is the opposite right okay um I could absolutely do a hearing test I did a ear cleaning where I'm like muffled until as the audio progresses I'm less muffled I thought it was pretty cool I need to edit it actually it might be one of my one and four because I owe you four this whole Skyrim stream actually kind of went perfect because tomorrow I will do my monetization celebration stream where everyone can absolutely laugh in I'm pretty sure someone's probably already guessed what I've got planned for it there's no way after yesterday's stream someone hasn't put two and two together and knows why I got a pedicure in particular I refuse I refuse she fell for the oldest these eggs box joke honestly do a 540 believe it um my body prevented me from my dreams so I come about have you ever had an actual medical ear cleaning I've not had a medical ear cleaning but I did get my hearing checked as a child um because I was ignoring my mum where I was undiagnosed it was my idea actually um I'm going to sip my tea before it gets too cold okay eh yeah my mum got me uh sent her a hearing test because she was sitting on my dash she was like scrawny doesn't he listen to me like scrawny scrawny never hears me and I used to do this thing where I sat right in front of the tv so the tv was on a stand but I would sit directly under it so my neck was looking directly upward sorry I just hit the mic there by yeah I know you can't see my hands but my mic was at my mic my neck was directly upwards looking at the tv like pure pure in a trance like straight up like Tism a doctor walked in and Tism was the diagnosis type thing and obviously my mum didn't know what it was all about at the time so I got sent for a hearing test and she was like the wife that did the hearing test on me she was like oh no pet you're here in Spain I don't know what's going on with you um and yeah basically that was that's when the signs start to show and then now here I am someone who has to read and write for a living and goodness gravy is it freaking hard I'm slurping is she okay nah she's just fucking hell autistic a kid with autism how close were you to the tv oh I'm not being funny when I'm like I was directly below the tv I like I was sitting crisscross looking directly up at the tv and my neck was up in the air like and I and my mum ascertained that it was hearing issues rather than something else what might be going on she had a case of strong autism honestly the strong too strong and that's not good for your eyes oh well I do actually need to be wearing my glicks but I'm making it work okay I was right in the vtuber collab scripts and I was like this is too small this takes so I zoomed in and I'm like oh my god I'm gonna be a blind as a fish like really soon wait that's literally me as a kid literally do you reckon cuttlefish have actual autism um as an uncertified marine biologist anything is possible if you didn't know down syndrome is possible in animals as well um I believe down syndrome is the deletion of chrome zone oh god was it in humans uh not 32 that's not right I can't remember which deletion it is but it can happen in gorillas seriously I'm not even kidding look up down soon down syndrome gorilla and like it's fucking creepy oh it's an extra addition of 21 sorry yeah I'm thinking of the deletion one what is the deletion one called that I always watch documentaries about it happens when life deletes 32 yes um actually spindle fiber failure um uh which is I um I find it really interesting oh god yeah I feel like every time I'm like I find this so interesting and fascinating it leads to me rambling about something that you guys couldn't give less of a shit about I feel really bad but at the same time I really like blabbing away so I'm like that just do it that just tell you about um fertilization so the reason why the rate of down syndrome goes up dramatically the older the woman is beyond the age of 25 yes the age of 25 um you're you're already hitting the wall at 25 rip um the reason it goes up exponentially is because the failure of the spindle fibers that's what pulls apart um that's what pulls it apart and then results in a the an additional chromosome wiggling about which is the rise of down syndrome which is why women who um are having children later in life are often advised to do what is referred to as a DNA test which I've completely forgotten the name of but basically they pierce the amniotic sac and take a tiny cell sample of the baby and then check its DNA sequence under um you know get it because to see if the child has done syndrome or not and then either they're advised would you like to terminate or not or bring to term whatever type thing goes on but um it definitely is a risk and uh like also being obese with the child as well results in gestational diabetes which is very dangerous for the child very dangerous for the mom um there's also um if depending on the blood type of the mother and the blood type of the child the mother during the entire pregnancy her body can be attacking the baby until it has a natural abortion if you didn't know abortion is the natural term but you can also get a medical abortion but abortion is the natural term for it just happening there are many reasons why it can never come to term how do you know all this stuff is fascinating no I don't go to school I like watching youtube videos about um biology related things I have a fascination in uh diagnoses in particular like why the reason it occurs for example um like uh there's this syndrome uh of course it evades my mind I think it's called like William Hunter's syndrome where the child or the well the child that can become an adult um because you you do not pass away uh unless you have complications with other diseases for example um you will never experience the sensation of being full uh you will constantly eat um there's like hereditary syndromes as well like hunter syndrome which is pretty uh devastating and um there's interesting one such as dwarfism dwarfism can actually be passed on by two individuals who visually do not have any um display of any dwarf uh ism genetics um but it is a recessive gene and if the two people come together um yep we can have it how do you know all this riefling that obviously has not got the angel man syndrome is that angel man syndrome is that the one where the child is locked in the child like stay I believe so mentally they can't develop any further um uh yes uh Harley Quinn syndrome um doesn't sound like what it is it's where your skin constantly your skin regenerates so fast that you flake and you break and it's just absolute it is a living heck for those poor like children that are born but you can make it to adulthood um there's a lot of sad um diagnoses that you can get like you can get childhood dementia those are quite crushing ones um stroneys institute for the gift to take that angel man is the eaten one is it Harley Quinn it she was this year is dwarf ism classified only as being short there are a redonkulous amount of dwarfism classifications um some can be like no stunted growth on the abdomen uh other versions are no stunted growth on the arms and the legs but the um organ holder area if you will for lack of better words abdomen all the interest in that like there's so many different classifications is quite um it's quite fascinating stuff when she uh get into torso yeah torso will do just nicely uh I remember when the photos of those babies were used as shock for yeah unfortunately um kind of if you use older like if you look up like Freud's stuff for example you get quite a few older photos that are like Freud Freud you didn't have to photograph that mate like you know do you know about prisons yeah like the stanley prison experiment and how people play roles that they perceive to be superior uh absolutely fascinating stuff I do enjoy the psychology I has to offer um I think humans and our everyday socialization were always kind of it's always insinuated that there's someone to look up to but I am a big believer in the three um three perspective talk and it's like parent to parent child to child adult to parent or something like that and it's like the three ways you can communicate with someone he said prions oh not prisons my apology I was talking about the the stanley prison experiment prions uh no a little bit about prions not not not too much sorry I just read what I wanted to read prudder's william's syndrome oh prudder willie syndrome that sounds like um I was mixing them up yes prions diseases are horrifying um did you know about the family of blue people from generations of I know there's a family that's like on youtube because someone goes and films them and they um communicate via barks because they have so many issues it's such a shame I want this woman to yank me for the rest of my life honestly uh well that speaking of prions um what is it rabid racoon bites you what's that called as soon as you develop um water phobia water phobia hydrophobia water phobia once you develop hydrophobia rabies that's it once you develop hydrophobia you have a hundred percent um loss rate uh you can't win it is it is some scary stuff and and to think that we are very lucky to avoid this by getting a simple tetanus shot um it turns out in test was not wincent are you squidding me right now I'm not I'm sorry for the interruption no no barnside note strani teacher outfit when I mean I'm down like I'm I'm down to clone you want strani teach you may be your teacher I'll be your I can teach you a few things I would do them for that maybe I should make an audio about that hmm I've uh a bit of a I have some leaks so close your ears if you don't want to hear about the audio leaks uh uh referring to my gen mates um so the new audio uh I don't know master manager wherever the frick you want to call them um is now in place uh there is like a I told you that she be has a four part series it's absolutely magnificent I've read it and I love it as there is four part series is now coming together oh my gosh golly if you like the being pampered being called a good boy or feeling little oh my you are eating good I don't even have a wee willy winky sausage I'm appreciating that that's all I'm saying I'm appreciating what is being put down uh Emmys uh is coming through um I actually need to send off a note because I accidentally wrote Emmys part one uh to our four part series which is a big mistake because having too many cooks spoils the broth especially when it comes to bloody scripts I gonna uh show you that much uh um what uh mercedes is overall like uh you finally accept being with the yandere and some people don't like that there's resistance I comprehend but in this one I want there to be resistance and then she breaks you okay that's what I want okay and what I want go I can't remember what aces is good mirror of aces though damn strongly are you the tower of babel because you are stacked in defiance of god and I cannot speak coherently when you go down oh thank you for the tip anonymous oh my god I tell a babel babel babel why Brian I can't believe you even said that loud honestly um are they gonna be on patreon they are gonna be on patreon please do uh don't however wait until the don't if you're like I do not have the money to support these girls do not worry you can do it for free by liking their streams and hanging out even if you're lurking it's perfectly fine um and then you might be saying to yourself but if I don't give money I don't get access to certain content while this is true wait until the don't know thorns I have purposely made the effort for goals to be public access um now please don't get me wrong there still be rewards for those who can but I have purposely pushed for public access rewards once goals have been met please let me try and cook it's very hard to find a good balance who goes there I don't find yourself um but yes I am I am trying my best to find the perfect thing we've already undercut at the market severely price point wise on patreon um and we hope that through showing the lack of greed the lack of greed uh that you know don't worry like even if you can't pay we're we've got you okay we've got you uh we'll hook you up okay let me just let's play some Skyrim anyone anyone want some room on their sky right here we go I'm in oh that's bloody loud I don't ever have my head set on right where are we where where are we the Tower of Babel is the old story about man about a man's hubris and defiance of god and the reason they allegedly that man speak isn't that Tower of Babel on or am I getting my bees mixed up my babel in the Tower of Babel Babylon accessibility no greed and moe miscompany I gotta go on a jogs and enjoy your jog I'd say listen to the stream but you might be bricked up by the time you're uh it's the Tower of Babel okay wait is Babylon just a location then Azura what are you doing in my game Azura what's going on Azura are you going to the high ground what are you doing what are you going to do once you're up here huh what are you going to do once you're up here nothing oh you're still going oh my god she's still going Azura where where are you supposed to go Azura is absolutely lagging I'm not I'm no lying she's absolutely lagging it oh I heard that that plot Babylon is the whole horror Babylon thing uh I've been playing too much I oh my gosh right that's it oh I like that okay she can beat him up it's fine I like that he's just dodging and then I just do one big oh that's a steal oh no wait a minute that's against the law I'm a good fantasy role player I broke her stance you know what else I'll break her hi man okay you're done where is it where's the enemy oh he's uh oh I never even saw that man I really do need my glasses on that's terrible legit I thought you were talking about Skyrim's Azura Azura isn't even in the other Skyrim didn't have Azura maybe Azura's star the kind of thing which is wait is this not it hey wait what how come crazy is this not it oh my god I've gone way too far ahead of the plot I've gone way too far ahead of the plot I've not even spoken to the guy to get him to move I was so confused why the trap door wasn't open up oh Azura gets you to clean out her star right you're done I'm not not you're done didn't even get to the the first message I read in chat after like a couple of minutes of combat that's terrible yeah Azura's star is I thought it was on I'm literally speed run the plot I've gone like 10 leagues ahead I do apologize Babel is where humanity teamed up to build a tower to heaven and knocked it down and honestly it's quite interesting how no I can't say that unfortunately um base I'm speed running the plot uh yeah I've been playing too much Binding of Isaac oh my god wait have I said I'm I'm like nine-name percent sure I've actually already said this but some of the girls are into tarot cards they're called um and it's the funniest thing ever and the reason why it's funny is my only exposure to tarot cards is the Binding of Isaac okay which means whenever they're talking about pooling cards or whatever they're like the tower card and I'm like yes yes six bombs six bombs you can probably unlock like a secret um like a tinted rock and get like a soul heart from it yes and like the lovers yes you can get two hearts if you can find a donation machine maybe you can get some coins out of it I'm like oh goodness sake like all of them must be rolling their eyes that my only experience like the friggin the hanged man uh oh yeah um that's fantastic I can uh I can fly in the room like or the full card oh yeah it takes me back to the starting of the the map oh that's amazing that's amazing uh hey I'm just gonna skip this part because I don't really need to see it um can you speak a little bit about your plans for membership no bother you shoot before but you're honestly worth it oh my god stop you're gonna make me blush um I will most likely do two memberships uh streams a week um most likely ASMR membership is probably the most requested I also like doing watch alongs um some stream snap games maybe for more closed things um well oh if you can speak okay it looks like only bribery works on him um two I mean yeah I want to make it worth your money like the way I try to think of it in my head is how much do you pay for like a movie ticket for like one and a half hours entertainment okay I'ma take that and then double it and then double it again so I'm like okay I'll try to stream every single day I'll also try to offer membership streams at least twice a week that seems fair that means in total for the membership not only do you directly support me and future projects gentle and the projects the girls want to pursue soon but we can't talk about any of it yet um and it means like also get like a more I suppose like a more intimate stream experience of people like that um like 17 dollars for a movie ticket that's outrageous um gen two confirmed live on the stream stocks I remember the first time I did this quest I was so nervous about like all the guards coming at me but they don't even care hanged man to we we can go well you do watch together streams for members I absolutely would love to do that yes we can a hundred percent do that gen two spoiled live no clickbait oh you just wait until there's don't a thumb for that if you want to see one of the concepts but not all I don't really talk about it in the server with the girls out of respect because of a a miscommunication on my part and honestly it's kind of easier it's much easier to go you know oh shit my bad you're right then to like explain in mass detail like what the most communication was you know like it is what it is gen two is just she be with a different voice in a real color mm-hmm I'm actually getting her take this a charcoal skin at some point I'm probably do it within the next one I brought in the coin and what not at all we're just skipping through the dialogue that can I be our skin into this look now since our transaction I love the gen two memes but gen one 3d though mm-hmm the girls are all very interested in 3d the problem is I don't know I don't have a heart no sure what can I do for you no you should think about staying the night oh wait I know one of those songs but she doesn't sing it it's Roderick Roderick there's nothing like a good song to lift the spirit sure what can I do for you no there once was a hero named ragnar the rest who came riding to white run from old Roderick then all this ragged and ragged and brandish his blade as he told the vault stories and gold that he made oh I can't remember the rest I need the rest of it it's in another in I said another in she doesn't she doesn't go here right we're just gonna if you want to skip this quest literally just time sink and he will teleport because it's just such a whatever way you go about it you know the 3d will be lit yeah I don't have a clue like they baby had like such a gorgeous 3d model but I'm like 9 in percent sure that shitting vr chat um but I don't know what it is and I'm not sure any of the girls have 3d experience either to help me out the best I can do is like 3d vr chat but I don't know if that's disappointing for them um well maybe ask sin sin is vr chat I asked her and I was quite happy with her model like um and I think that's like what the girls are if they're one 3d like that's all of God you know um I'll be a learning experience for all vr chat streams being created with you know could you imagine aces dg sessions in for your chat yeah it's it's not necessarily a lot of work because I just oh you can't wait in this location damn game forces you east empire company warehouse I wonder if that was by the British Empire British um so this level you're supposed to like alert from this guy but uh yeah I need to offer the girls um what are they called all the trackers but I myself don't actually know what trackers they need and I don't know what the full price point is like I've been really open and honest with the girls and been like obviously once everyone's monetized we can see what kind of money you're earning and if it's good it's bad like because obviously if the girls money's low they're not going to want to stick around are they um so I do have some kind of like um mildly boosting efforts but it's not really yeah you know it's kind of when you're on the managing side it's kind of like I can only do so much with what the girls give me very thankfully the girls are giving me they're all like literally everyone streamed every single day which was insane within reason of course um and like they're taking it a bit more easy this week which I'm very glad to see we do almost I'm a sneak increase yeah or do you think he notices me at all yeah no uh there are some really nice uh things you can do in VR chat I have seen something I didn't what detected me oh oh no he's discovering all the dead bodies along the way but he doesn't find that suspicious like at all I don't know if my my poor heart can take stronti in 3d it would be so fun because you can see how like animated I um I thought about doing a dance 3d stream where like I play music that you guys suggest and like we just dance and drink and stuff I don't know is that weird um just a body nothing so so legit oh well it mustn't be anything um I thought that would be cute like rating your songs and stuff but I don't know how good the tracking is like because I want I want to see my butt jiggle I won't be twerking and stuff I know the year is transparent and it's really endearing how come I draw to making sure everyone eats good both the talents and fun it's right here in my favorite I just uh is he gonna just check to me I mean clearly he just doesn't care if someone go oh um 3d stronti hypnotizes you that'll be interesting like I just don't know how 3d works at all I think vain or like sony notes are the default for most tracking I've seen VR avatars of pendulum and spiral tall everyone just the exception stronti okay so he does a little uh jabate where he actually comes walking back which is why I'm hanging back right now because he's a wee liar um but yeah 3d definitely on the cards we're just obviously we're kind of in the recoup funds stage um and kind of seeing where everyone is of everyone happy like I sent the girls all a message I was like is there anything I can do to make your experience better like how do you feel after your first week and I got like a lot of good feedback so um I'm just gonna be getting ready to get the girls shorts more consistently because it's taking me a hot second to get shorts out I was hoping to at least get them like two a week out right now it's like a one-wing oops and that's just because I suck and I'm gonna fall in the water stronti but don't jiggle jiggle it falls my money don't jiggle jiggle it falls I like to see you wiggle wiggle for sure by the way when our membership expected to become available on tomorrow's stream um I'm gonna get it all set up um and all of that so tomorrow's stream isn't gonna be Skyrim we're not gonna do full achievements because I don't know why my achievements aren't working there are enemies all over here but you can just go swinging you picked a bad time to get lost I think if this is no there is a health potion stacked over there somewhere I remember correctly oh I thought there was a health potion here I guess no it's just Wayne close enough we can sell these potion restraints so there's just spiders in there I don't know if there's anything else you can just go willy nilly through this it's not really um no magic I hate magic I don't want to go I can literally hear that spider in that cave it's membership gonna stream yeah it's tomorrow so the the Skyrim part two is getting steam rolled over to make way for the monetization stream and then I'm like 100% sure you guys know exactly what I'm doing tomorrow it's not even gonna be a surprise at this point um but just yeah this is just gonna be a one off Skyrim because if the achievements were working then yeah but I don't know why they're not so we might actually do calming a bit earlier than expected she be as live again yes she be cotton boom any any cotton boom um oh my god oh he's armored up who's next archer oh I have no idea I'm just stupid to figure out are you wait do you know do you guys wait just take a guess at what you think my monetization stream tomorrow is take a guess and I'll see if you guys know I'll tell you if you got it right or not right where's the guy he should be here oh there is right yeah feet yeah okay feet stream it's feet ASMR I'm gonna have the camera on my feet and because I have decks there in my toes I'm literally gonna hold the ASMR tools with my toes and do like ASMR feet stream that's me yeah feet yeah I like to it's ridiculous I know yeah I know it's ridiculous but I thought it was funny as anything and because my model has like french tip toes I thought like yeah it's perfect I don't think my other toes are gonna heal in time for it though unfortunately it's pretty mangled I don't I don't think I have to go to the doctor I think I have to go to the doctor if it starts getting inflamed you needed to know more now tell you what consider me your new friend in the north I'm keeping the deed any objections consider it again Carlisle didn't even want it why did card like a purchase golden thing now that I know who she maven if if I was maven okay blah blah blah blah blah wait I must have spent a lot of time and resources would be demonetized I mean can you get demonetized it's literally just fee like uh if you kind of take away the ha ha funny from it it's literally just a body part and ASMR and like me is that dog what um I heard that okay gods could you get any more perfect that's the only concept I came up for like my monetization celebration um people walk on their feet all the time yeah like I just think it's more like funny ha ha than it is like anything else but like I this time so I don't keep repeating it but I genuinely like feel so feminine now that I've got like my little manicure pedicure like I felt so pampered like I was completely uncomfortable with the entire situation but I did feel really pampered and I was like oh this is actually kind of nice hold on a minute hold on a minute these gender norms have hands god damn it not again I've fallen for another one it's too difficult it's too difficult I can't resist I thought I could can you really not jump this oh fine you are very feminine literally like apparently my hands are super small as well like oh these gender norms have hands foot rubs though I will admit the foot rub that felt like heavenly oh my god like my like brain was like a wire and funny I was like hold on this is like super relaxing I can't believe it all the freaking stereotypes about whamming like in foot rubs are true it's awful I felt I felt so good though I was like damn I need a need a reflin right now I need a need a sacrificial a sacrificial reef one right now oh can I do that at the convention if we do a convention oh my god I'm literally going through all the Skyrim right now just to get to the other side of the map is strong he's a girl I can't believe it I'm more impressed with her dexterity how much dexterity you have for your toes honestly my grippers on a rock you'll never guess what I'm sitting on right now take a guess what did you need I volunteer literally should I just do that where you're like massage my feet at the convention oh he said oh wait no I have sweaty feet oh I can't let yous do that the reason why the women could do it is because I had to put my feet in like this little water bath so she had no clue that she was dealing with the sweaty feet in the west so we're now learning that Carlaya is this evil evil trying to take down the thieves guild so we're gonna meet and mercer free or sorry mercer free and I if you want the correct english are going to go and confront them um and it's called scoundrels foley oh no I've just completed that I'm actually such a lawyer oh wait I need I'm freaking sick says exchange a piece of armor but we're about to get more armor anyway so it's fine don't worry guys I'll take one for the team everyone here volunteer and to be sacrificial refund my poor refunds what have I done he is honestly uh no way this is like the closest landmark it's gonna be a bit of a wonk I feel like I'm still level one why do I refuse to level up level up it doesn't matter what you're sitting on we cry because it's not us right there's someone on I don't know if you guys like you swear too much but there's someone on twitter literally called like mummy's chair and a freaking hee-haw every time I see them I'm like that name's hilarious like your guys's names on runescape were hilarious as well um but it's actually so funny just travel to white rune stable and buy a carry oh you are actually so correct however we might meet Cicero on the road so there is a chance I have faith let's run that guy literally we know actually down the screen whoa who are you oh you're a kaji are you mark at the liar you don't wish me well oh what do you have on your prayer skimmer he's getting high if you didn't know the kaji have a a really bad habit with skimmer you found him I knew I recognized I was like is that the liar of course he's a skimmer literally got nothing on his persons but three skimmer he is set for life oh my god we flings we have reform look at that chicken butt chicken butt chicken butt what oh Lydia no way she dances with me what what chicken butt what what chicken butt I like how she mimics me chicken chicken chicken chicken chicken oh look it's your egg oh you have so many eggs oh my god this is exactly what I want is this what older like chicken head covers just like that's amazing oh my god I would absolutely love to do a stream about the domestication of animals as well think of how many endless animal species we have and there's only I think 11 domesticated species isn't that amazing although there was one russian guy who tried to domesticate foxes and he actually got really far but it does take years and years you can hypnotize a chicken by drawing the line and dirt in front of them oh oh oh I was a little moaned to head there please email them thank you uh there's a little shack down here domesticated foxes would be adorable they would oh there's a bear in this shack I recognize this place from many I totally I've never heard a wolf how old like that before but Lydia can you deal with them so I don't have to slow down I'm trying to make it to the uh location there is probably bandits here actually that's one thing I do have to complain about Skyrim there's like bandits in every freaking place ever literally I've not even approached this landmark and it's like yeah bandits by the way it's like bro I didn't even get a freaking chance to breathe there's always a bear foxes are difficult the worst part is they pee on everything fox girl gen two confirmed made it into pee allure confirmed right there's a stable over here so we're gonna head for it what's the difference between taming and domesticating taming is temp horary friendship whereas domestication anyone can take over with it I think because you can tame a wild hedgehog but you can't domesticate it yeah no that kind of sounds like I'm on the right tracks but I did just I don't actually know the real can you please discover that thank you just sweet time peeler my beloved peeler confirmed by stroney fox girl for peeler lmao let the only reason they're in is because of the the content the girls like to put up domestication is an extremely long process of taming yes I would agree with that statement well they put fast travel on so they had to compensate for people who'd fast travel instead of walk and they need more bandits oh bro every time you want to walk like two centimeters the game's like enemy enemy enemy enemy taming is when you train a wild animal to be friendly around humans domestications when you breed an animal over multiple generations to benefit a human yes so a lot of people don't know that sheep um infinitely grow will that's because of human selective breeding that they produce so much will and they've now required to be shaved like you ever hear those stories that make the news that's like this sheep evaded the farmer for five years and he has five years of like mats on him and the only reason that's actually even mildly possible is because he was bred that way he was bred to produce like copious amounts of wool and and it's like the same for horses you know how horses need little clippy cloppy horses the reason for that is because of selective breeding and and the horse in the wild will naturally wear down its rocks its hooves on rocks and stuff like that and what is going on here who's our key um like yeah silkworms we use for silk can't survive in the wild yeah i would really love to do a domestication thing um i'd love to do a history one i just saw that on a perforx that wolf garden huh i don't think i've ever seen a sheep on the news yeah when you come from scotland sometimes the news is rather bland um you know not a lot going on in scotland if you watch the scottish news oh no he didn't mate why why does the horse who's horse is that hello i'm sorry i'm late good we're finally hydration check i've scouted the ruins and i'm certain carliah is still inside you saw her no i found her horse don't take care of it that horse didn't need to perish let's get moving i want to catch her inside while she's distracted take the lead you want me to lead understood just make certain you keep your eyes open carliah is selectively breeding wiflings to four you can't say that that's hilarious you can't say that oh my god that's so true what the fuck that's so funny i'm sorry i can't even laugh at that that's so funny um i'd rather the news be bland than hyperpolarizing oh i don't even consume the news anymore where where are you bro i can hear your armor what are you okay there you are jeez is everyone because she's growing so much will have actually become a deficient sheep farmers don't make any money from willson synthetic fibers if a police will we have to go back we need to go back please please no more plastic i'd like same i hate watching yeah like it's just unwatchable it just you you'll finish a news broadcast um and you're just like wow i hate life and it was like don't if if you consume things that like genuinely make you more upset at the end of them it's it can be quite addictive and comforting to like watch it in the moment but when you realize it's bad for you like you can just kind of posthump on it you know come back another time uh there are droggers up ahead but it's not anything we can't uh the droggers i'm actually gonna loot them the reason because a lot of droggers drop um um soul gems which i'm needing a heck of a lot more of i said they drop soul gems soul gems se oh ah oh gems i can see that but i don't mean whoa okay sorry i'm sorry please forgive me for pill in the lever i didn't mean i promise i won't do it again we all okay they're just dropping gems i couldn't freaking uh i didn't even get a chance to wiggle it no no oh oh potions lovely i'll sell them for pennies honestly will is still warm even oh wait sorry sorry i was looking at the corner of my eye oh ah i can so ends the lesson uh doggers don't usually have soul gems wait who do i think have soul gems on them oh the the centaurians have um the the good golden guys no i'm like going left side i'm like okay there we go so many soul gems okay they just have gold on them apparently we get it your feeble attempts he's like so nope don't ask me how long it took me to find the opening to this so my first playthrough it's so painful this was my first ever um skyrim game actually my dad played morrow and um but my my favorite thing about morrowind is that you can just jump on the spot um and then like you level up your stamina it's quite interesting oh i can do this you mean elder school's game yeah wait what did i say my first skyrim game sad oh my dumb dumb and he i was gonna say it's even oh no not me right now ryan hey stroney i wanted to ask you something yeah i know you can speak scott but i was curious to know if you knew gaelic as well cause if i remember correctly there's not that many people left in scotland that can speak it no they don't teach us that uh if you come from the mainland you don't learn gaelic at all um it's basically a dying language because they refuse to teach it to the next generation i don't know if it's gonna change i hope it'll change in the future but sadly no i do not speak gaelic which is just how it is they do not teach it and oh pretty shit um but thank you for the tip narrow yes uh very sadly the they don't teach it uh if you're from the mainland of scotland and i am from the mainland of scotland if you didn't know lovely little uh scot wait no did i mean to do that i don't think i meant to do that did i um if i didn't come from the mainland and i came from the shetland for example which is at the north some it's okay if you don't really know scotland that well um where the heck is this red on the map that i get am i going the right way yel skeever okay i'm going the right way i don't know how to do that that's so sad gaelic is one of the very few Celtic languages out left yeah like um uh something's here scotland and ireland and all that were like pagan fucking hell this is a lot of enemies got enemies got a lot of enemies i'm just swanging i'm just swinging around my new ones business honestly me if i was a guy i'd be elephant and that stuff up i'm 42 i'm leveling up faster than my fishing and runescape although you still need a trans a translator for glass region yes the scots is the he just like went flying uh you really wanted that um there's poison darts if i remember correctly yeah i'm just too good i just remember everything honestly um yes i am very lucky that i do have scots at least which is recognized as its own language which is really cool and i know it sounds like i'm like speaking that's because i don't use slang at all like at all um oh we're almost there uh we're almost there um uh i'm completely forgotten what was happening about i hate these guys because they can yeah they can disarm you which i don't like wait he he has special eh i've never seen this before this is not freaking xbox certified flawed barla stone what the heck is that why why did why did pc yell these cool things what the heck is a wireless stone can you do a fool on scottish dream uh i mean if you mean slang i can only really do it for like a couple of minutes because it's just like i get more mumbly and like oh good morning good evening good afternoon and all that who's it going like it just doesn't really sound that good and i don't think it's that relaxing either like and i kind of hate to put it on because my mom was like no then he speaks slang in the house so i didn't and then obviously being an online creator it's the complete opposite everyone wants to hear you with a slang in every hand and it's like oh right then i guess it's a bit uh it's a bit forced because i was discouraged from speaking words these doors have a weakness pc got updates xbox charges per update plus pc got lots of content xbox charges per update i don't know it's just a bit pointless learning gaelic when english is so common yeah like oh i ain't looking good i ain't looking good i'm gonna take a nap right here can you talk dirty scott's if you want and a member stream sure yeah i remember liby saying some scott's can't pronounce for yeah so if i say how i normally annunciate purple burglar alarm

recent versions of the game my ps4 even got these updates you know it's time for you and gallas to become reunited okay lol it's okay you're still very dumb but snap it will make me blue i was going to make you say purple burglar after my first super chat i said that before she was like how long until someone asked for purple burglar alarm because it's quite common to be asked to say it and like i hope i don't sound moody like when i do it because i'm like for people who watch long term they'll know like how often i get asked it but for people who like pop in for the first time i don't want

aggressive okay he's just a wee bit aggressive the hack out you're thinking of is outside riverwood oh this looks like a dragon's grave if i've ever seen one oh no maybe not i don't know he'll get crab girl sees a creature gen two confirmed i'm just teasing you guys with that by the way oh no merchant's journal okay hold on what happened here i begged my husband not to go but he just wouldn't listen he said if he delayed the shipment even another week the legion would find someone else to take it south let them keep their blasted money the road to white run is dangerous he says everyone knows that so many caravans have been attacked so many travelers vanished into thin air some say it's only bandits but they're rumors are worse goblins ghosts and witches 20 years we've been married now and i can't bear the thought of losing them i'm not letting them go alone not this time we'll never die together together mara preservas oh where's the man oh no oh who to who to uh it's terrible picks up coins oh who did that that's terrible uh coconut crab vtuber oh isn't that not that massive gigantic crab v suckies gen two's name by the way yeah gen two already i already have the logos for gen two and three made um because they were they it was like cheap and it was like i might as well lost them out because i already know what i'm gonna call them i'm just gonna discover this location i don't know if we're gonna start going against the force one shortly there are another type of bandits essentially uh right how do i get around i guess i get around oh no robbs corpses look they're not gonna need it let's be honest they're not gonna need that those nine coins gen three spoiled no there's absolutely nothing planned of gen three i don't even know what concepts i want and stroney did you see what you want yes what i want i submit what i want and then i get back something and then i keep going to the drawing board that's how it works so you're at my mercy shoulda picked mercy you can't purchase in the afterlife gen six absolutely no i am done birthing any children after gen three i mean it's also like uh there's a whole other thing to it there's actually a whole other trust factor as well like gen one i completely trust wholeheartedly um like i did my thorough research on the girls and like when i when i did the interview like i never got any bad vibes or whatever um which sounds terrible like oh you did an interview like an informal interview and went off of was there bad vibes or not and the answer is yeah i did actually um because and when you hear people talk you can get a sense of like especially when they expect it like a super um like a super professional thing and you're just like oh surprise it's actually just me me man uh here's here's the rules type thing um mercy's patreon just went live oh she got an update i can't even remember what her update was i i don't know i don't know what the tags are even though i was the one who put that up there for her sounds like you got a trust you got yeah like i i get described as naive a lot which i honestly don't mind i actually genuinely agree with that and kind of assessment sorry i'm just trying to hit loads of markers along the way so we can just backtrack like this super easily um oh is this like a little hunter's lodge thing going on oh it's like a little campsite oh anyway we eating good tonight after three generations there's a real a real risk of bad actors trying to get in that software yeah so because um i need to choose my words carefully but i hope you can agree with um my my my thought process but it may not be reality because it's just my thought process um it is very plausible that there were vtubers who were interested but didn't apply because they wanted the guaranteed success of gen 2 like to see what gen 1 achieved to see what gen 2 achieved because not that they didn't put their faith in the plan it's not so obviously you want to you want to be a part something that's successful let's wait am i on the right way or am i on the wrong way no i'm gonna write um i need to try and think of my sense just like i'm really happy with gen 1 and everyone is good basically however the rate as you said the rate of a bad actor coming into play does get higher um but hopefully you know there's girls like with you know plenty of experience and i can just see and assess them you don't want to risk the gamble yes it's like i don't know how to say that i just knew all the girls i'm trying to have a really nice moment talking about my girls okay um the risk does get higher when new people are introduced that may not have previous history like um what the heck what am i trying to do where the heck am i trying to go you can't see me um i think you're doing the right thing you don't want to feel like you're even messed up in the wrong thing yes that like um i did speak of someone who applied and then i went on their twitch just to check them out in general and they spoke about how they only want to hang around for one year and then send their audience to their old account and the quote was like because the creator seems so chill or something and i got an in route um and it was just like kind of shocking and it does like kind of slap me back to reality that like people who apply they might not actually want to hang around and achieve like loads of goals they might just do it to go do their own thing the lover stone this always feels the comforts of love all skills improve faster if all skills improve faster then sure call me the lover stone uh who would put that on social me out what wow you know that really happened um they uh applied their application and i pretty much checked out everyone's stream um uh after they applied just to see what they were putting out there because um there was a very notable trend of people applying and then all of a sudden their stream uh consistency ramped up because they were getting assessed and they were aware they were getting assessed uh i don't think i didn't notice that if you were one of those girls um uh there was also stream variety came out of nowhere some people were very glued to one type of game um and all of a sudden uh they start doing a variety of games uh kind of showing that they can play a different um but yes um i did get to experience someone who openly admitted that they basically applied but couldn't care less about the actual longevity of violour and it is quite scary to think that there's a possibility that even through my vetting process um there is a team who also assessed uh the girls that get in as well um and maybe at a later date i can maybe speak a bit more about i think now is a bit too sensitive of a time because obviously it's only been uh one week excuse me sorry just dealing with this guy he is a very bad man do not trust him are you good that man nearly killed me you saved my life oh thank you here well what do we get i think we get a gold band from or something uh why were they after you know i don't have any idea does that affect your judgment what does what affect my judgment i'm so sorry you're gonna have to go over that again sorry i completely forget uh what my like previous sense was azure's voice was too perfect for the character yes i i did admit that if azura did not accept uh i was essentially up shit creek because everyone who applied i was not satisfied with their fit for the voice i did say though i said it before anyone's like uh that's not fair they were born that way they just got in uh what about rooting for the underdog okay you know fuck off um this agency isn't for fucking like sorry i do get a bit passionate like you never fucking cheered for the underdog in your life like shot it's you and zeal you idiot i i'm sorry i just choked on my bullet i'm getting a bit too i'm in the middle of some very stupid work sorry that really hurt oh how can i help you sorry oh persistent aren't you oh very well oh am i to stand in the way by gen three strony strony's gonna need to recruit refland spies to be in the applications inner circle honestly i love seeing you get passionate about it all oh it's it's honestly fascinating stuff to be behind the scenes um i absolutely wait what am i okay well what i have been the artifact i've discovered in the shoe and zeal sorry i'm just freaking mad to think i while being an admirer i'm sure you can i'm not certain how many scholars you're accustomed to dealing very well uh whatever um uh he did give us a key so i think we can just go for it come v-trippers reincarnate into another model jimmy for those who apply we the dwidmer museum isn't open to anyone because cal you have a problem with that go talk to him i have a problem with it i don't have freaking out okay hold on a little to the left oh oh oh uh uh now everyone knows i suck at lot girl hold on you stop shaking at me yeah that's what i thought don't talk to me don't talk to me bro all right uh i don't think we can sneak through here i think they attack me uh i'd rather die than go to prison fucking hell this is a bit dramatic but i think we're doing it oh i missed i missed i

completely wrong way i think i'm i might have i think i went completely wrong way pardon me it's barred from another site so i was going the right freaking way ah right okay let's try again i'm sure i can figure it out when i get there i feel like a some secret offer is it no these are living quarters you're the stealthiest thief ever strong and no one will see you if they're dead exactly i don't know why that's still going because i pulled a lever uh i think i did it on the other side of the poison uh i guess if you wanted to be stealth you could just go through the poison but we'll just go for it we're going we're going we're going i'm being a dome dome okay turn the off right there so it's quiet and then up the stairs literally they were right there and i walked away from them it's just feeling quirky okay just feeling misunderstood mmm just let it happen just let it happen just let it happen just let it happen it's okay just let it happen just let it happen just let it happen it's okay it's okay just let it happen Mm, big potatoes. Just, oh, 20, 20, go, enchanting. That's good, that'll be like enchanting up in here. Just let it out. Okay, we don't really need to, oh, the box, we need that. Mm, is this the barred door? It was! Okay, we've now got the shortcut. So what's this? It's a chest. And then what's that? That's just the other side of the map. Oh my god, we did it. It's not war crime if it's a cute girl. Me committing war crimes? Stop, you're making me laugh. Oh my gosh, I'm so turned around. It's been so long since I've done this. It's called barbarian stealth, honestly? I actually really like that description for my thingy. Like, I've always tried to do... What the heck? Jump shot. Oh, right, wait, what? There's a tic-tac to leave there. I don't think there's any enemies until they come in. We just need to pick up some charcoal and a piece of paper, steal the paper, steal the charcoal. It took me so long to figure out this area. Heavy armor increased to 16. Well, it wasn't really worth the level up. But hey, we did it. I'm gonna break some... Break it down now. Oh, look at that. Look at that. We do have a bow and arrow. Fire damage? Soul trap? Maybe... No, maybe not a soul trap on us. I would say fire damage. Take a little burn. Now, what? Petty or... Bubbish. You know, Seagrog. Method of stealth, honestly. Look, if it works, is there... Is there truly a point? Is there truly a point? Right, so the enemies do come in here. Obviously, because we are playing on legendary mode and I'm just so MLG pro. Yeah, excuse me. We're just gonna one-shot them, confidently. We are just going to one-shot them, confidently. We are just gonna one-shot them. Nice and confidently. No problems. CUTELY commits crimes against humanity, honestly. Have you played Ghost of Toshima? I haven't. One-shot, 100%. Return to the guy. Where's the guy? Is he in here? Oh, return to the guy, guy. Return to the guy. Walk on fire. Why the heck does it make me go backwards? I'm just... The map in is a bit rough. Can I loot this? I can't. They're so good. Wait, are the guards gonna attack me? Are the marker of guards gonna attack me? I think they might. I come back and see you're still in... Eh, no. I'm sorry, but these accusations are unfounded. I'm not a novice. I'm on legendary, clearly. Look, I'm sorry to your untrained eye, but when you get really good at the game, it just makes things... Why did it do that? Why did you do that? Why does the game do that? Honestly, I could fart on it something. Yeah, just because I'm such a high-skilled level, it makes it appear to be a very easy level. So please don't worry about it. No, okay. I've played this game for two... How dare you? Why is the child in the basement? Alright, here's the translation, bro. I'm rubbing. When you're amazing, you make everything look easy. Yeah, legendary. See how that's not valued at 50? It's not going to teach you nothing. Don't open that book. Maybe sometime you should judge a book by cover. Mercer Frey is the baddie. Dun-dun-dun! He's trying to once you rub him. That's actually my specialty. The Nightingales! It seems to describe the failure of the Nightingales, although it doesn't go into great detail. Gallus also repeatedly mentions his strong belief that Mercer desecrated something known as the Twilight Sepulcher. She bawled under that hood. Baw headed in. The annoying hint is actually the bad guy. I'm shocked, colouring me surprised. Golden writing standards by the dev team. Bald! It always annoyed me when you put on a hood, your hair gets removed and annoys me so much. It's just such a... Excuse you, anyone talking to you? Listen, all I want is the truth to be revealed to the guild. They respected Carlaya and she deserves better. Do whatever you can and I'd consider it a personal favour. Sure, thank you. If you ever manage to gain entry to the college and you find trying to rid yourself of stolen goods... He's a fan! I've been known to handle items of questionable interest from time to time. Questionable interest, I like that. We must hasten to rift in before Mercer can do any more... We must hasten to rift in! Bald gent who member confirmed... No! No! Say it ain't so. I will not go. Turn the lights off. Carry me home. Oh my god, members carry okay. I can absolutely wreck my voice on that. I can get beer. I can get beer! And we can do membership karaoke. And I can do song requests. You guys put it together. I'll be pretty good. I'll drink till you spew. Carla currently and kindly explaining the Nightingale lore and her relationship to Gallus whilst I sing that one beer parody song that had that Lego animation. Why are you in the basement child? I'm getting weirded out. Leave me alone! Get away! Creepy wee thing, honestly. And you sing Flare of Scotland? No, I have to be hate music. I'm not singing, I'm getting drunk and going Oh, Flare of Scotland When will we see our life again? I don't know why national songs insist on going so high. Can't you just give me one song where the decibels, the notes in it are just really common and everyone can sing it. Donald, where are your choosers? What's that song? I think I've ever heard of it. I missed beer whilst I was grabbing a drink. No, no, no, we're going to do drunk membership thingy. Back to where I am. I'll take my poops in. I'm ready, let's go. I was going to force us to sing Christmas carols on Christmas. I like a wee and a manger. A wee and a manger. No crib for a pit. Why does it go so high pitch? Why can't they not just have a song down here? No crib for a bed. The little Lord Jesus laid down his sweet head. The cattle are lowing. I was going to force you guys to do freaking Christmas songs with me and then we watch Lord of the Rings on Christmas. Where the winds blow high, where the winds blow to the streets and my cattle go. Although as you say hello Donald, what the freak, I've never heard that. Do you have titsangles? Do they wobble to the floor? I can't say that, I'm sorry. I'm getting a bit delirious, hold on a minute. You've never heard that song before. Do they go to and fro? She's not even drunk yet. Just talking about alcohol is getting me steaming. It's making me lose the plot. No, it can't be. No, it can't be. What's that mean? He quoted the main. The floor? Yeah, it's a bit dirty, we're currently in the sewers. Do they wobble to the floor? Can you tie them in the knot? Can you tie them in a bow? My kami oshi hates Mongolian throat singing. It's because cats don't like the sound of the vibration that Mongolian throat singing provides. So thus I don't like it, I don't like vibrations. That rrrrrrr. No, bad. Cats don't like it, it makes their ears go back. So it makes my ears go back. World's greatest thieves live in a sewer. Down in the sewer. Ever listen to the nasty shrank, please? Let's go. The memer is starting to break free. I want to break free. My cat likes it. Your cat does not like Mongolian throat singing and I will not be taking any further statements. I assure you, your cat does not like Mongolian throat singing. Beast cat, absolutely not. Are you sure about that? Rip project women OST fans and shambles due to the Mongolian throat singing. I was so hard to sing that. Any song is hard to sing, my voice is so frazzled. Can I meet my life away? Sorry, the thieves gold are now just revealing that Mercer has betrayed them for many years and there's not a penny left for them. Meet my life away. Why is Caravans a frog in the stream? Caravans a frog here. I would like to do some karaoke. Sing your cover live. He also like rock music. We doubt you don't like vibrations. I've got an even funner fact. I only like it. Before I help you track Mercer now, I need to know what you learned from Carlya. Mercer killed Gallus, not Carlya. Gallus, Carlya and Mercer were nightingales. Was there anything else she told you? I was behind Golden Glow and Honeybrew. Was there anything else? Say it. I need you to break into my... The magic button cannot handle the vibration. Be careful, just find a way in. But the dark road home can. You have permission to kill anyone that stands in your way. Oh, I have permission. Okay, infiltrate Mercer's home. Oh, everyone's on alert. Alert, alert, Mercer. Alert, alert. All are welcome at the Temple of Mora. Ah, there we are, but you shouldn't be here. I don't doubt for one second. I won't remember that. Please continue. Information stored and saved. Yee... Literally... There's no doubt about it. The tales gilded back. I didn't realize how... Fake speedish that all the voice actors' accents try to mimic. It's actually quite jarring. Be careful. What are you talking about? Hello? Hello? This is Mercer Frey's place and he don't like visitors. Now go away. I need to get inside Mercer's house, please. No visitors, no way. Now piss off before you make me mad. I'll make it worth your while. You ain't got enough coin to make my problems go away. Unless you can talk to Maven Blackbriar and to let me out of my debt. Okay. You try and set one foot in this yard and I'll cut it off. Fine. I'll go talk to Maven about big... Big... Big stinky... What's your name? Bald? More like... Cold. Because it's freezing outside and you're not wearing any outfit. Oh! Absolutely rolled and decked. Hello? America, hiya. No, no, no. American? When's Azura's birthday? I believe it's the 23rd of August if I'm not mistaken. Is she not up? Where is she? He less of a shite. Where's Maria? Big Maria. Okay, hold on. If I put that on, it should show me where she is. Oh, she is here. You were there all along. Sam, if you don't want any of it, I'll take a bell for you. What did he do? Do you think Mercer... Is a cl- What? He's in debt because of a quill? Is this his quill that's in the freaking lake? I believe it. Oh, no. I think it might just be easier to perish this man. I think it's in a boat. Oh, goodness me, it's been many a year. I think it's in a boat. I'm gonna have to look at it on the HUD. Hold on. I want to say it's like somewhere here to the left. Oh, I could be terribly wrong though, but there should be a boat. It started. It's at the bottom of the lake somewhere. Thank you for your help. I really appreciate that. I am somewhere at the bottom of the lake. I don't even have water breathing either. I can't believe you. You had the audacity to take that out. You're just trying to upset me. What's this? What's that barnacles? Wait, wait, wait. Is this a hint? Hold on, let me breathe. Is this a hint that maybe you're around here somewhere? Hold on. Right, should we? Oh, no. Right, well, there was a box, but I guess not. There's rocks here. Is that telling me it's here somewhere? But the barnacles, there's more barnacles. Oh, can you say render distance, please? Stronius, under the water. You don't want reflins. Ah, let me breathe. I seem to think it's like the left side. I saw that storage box. I think that's the game being like hint. It's over here. Okay, hold on. Let me just check again. I think it's in a broken boat. Um, it's on the map somewhere. Right, I'm not reading chat for the next minute. You're on time out. You're done. I seem to think it's close to the edge of the water. Wait, this is a bit too close, clearly. By the bridge? I don't recall it being by a bridge, to be honest. You know what, reflin? What? A strong name. What do you think of the Indiana Jones game? I didn't know there was a new one. Oh, for goodness' sake. I think I'm off the mark. Where am I? Maybe it's like down here a bit. This is the entire area. Okay, I'm just going to do one big loop around the island. Why is there so many salmon? Shoney, I love you. Don't hate my friends. Wait, why would I hate your friends? I thought you weren't looking at us. Look, I forgive really easily. Oh, no, get up! Shabee, what are you doing? Underwater burning. Okay, I don't... think it's up this way. But we're going to just do a big circle for the sake of satisfying myself. Come up for water often. Reflins, remember that Shoney's much of an... as much of an addict as we are. Scuba, Shabee. Shabee, making me nervous. Oh, wait. Maybe I'm on one of these islands. I may be rocked up on a baby island. Do you know that? What the heck was that? I'm rabbit. Hold on. Let's just check the hut again. We're kind of at the furthest point of this section of the lake. I'm not really wanting to go too much further. It's near the box you found before. Oh, my God, I'm actually getting my hand held. See, thank you, refling. I actually get my hand held. And you're just freaking back there. I've gone way off course. Oh, my God, forgive me. Fucking nonchalant. It's between the big island and Riften. That's it. I'm giving in. Skyrimmer's been installed. Are you happy now? Oh, have I put you in the Skyrim mid? Yippee! I can't help the sarcasm. I forget where the thing is every time. In waste half an hour looking also. It's underwater, not on an island. Yeah, it's like crashed off of it. My eyes are currently burning, opening under the salt water. Right. That's not it. These are just textures. It's not like this. I can't even swim in. So there's no point. I'm gonna go buy that box again. If I could find the box again. We'll float to the right this time, not to be confused with the hit TV game. A little to the left. I don't know why I said TV game. Steam game. So those are the barnacles. I'm getting swept up. We're trying to find the quill. That maven. I did not realise how rubbish this game is. Is this for real? There's like two floating foxes under the cave. What's going on here? I can see loads of broken stuff. Hold on, let me breathe again. Right. Definitely not searchable. There's loads of boxes just hanging off the dock. It just works. I think you may have floated over it. It's not by the docks. I like the detail though, the concept that it fell off the boat and they can't retrieve it. That's quite smart. This is where I'm on the map. I'm like messing around here. Isn't this rock formation maybe? What the barnacles? Hold on, let me breathe. I'm like right, I'm like freaking, I'm here. I doubt it got dropped here. It just seems so unlikely. Go straight from the docks towards the island. Okay. Hmm. I'm searching, I'm searching. There's salmon, there's salmon, there's bulks, there's bulks, but it's more towards here. Don't need to breathe, hold on. Okay. Okay, this is new. I don't think I've investigated this. Maybe we have. They have a freaking potion of water breathing that would make this a lot either. Water breathing where? Water breathing. Oh, a whole 15 seconds. Oh, you're too kind, you're too kind. Oh! Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, fucking. Oh, oh, oh, I'm getting current. I'm getting drafted away by the current. Okay, fuck that. Alright, I was doing the new one. Stop, current, stop, I can't breathe. Oh. Ah! I've only got 10 lock picks. Going to be easy on me. I'm going to need to bow some more. No! Less? I'm like... Is that less or is that more? Oh. Give me that. Stupid bastard. Bastard, you're a quill. Right. We did it. Oh my god, that took well. Just get Vol-song and forget about that. What's Vol-song? She's got it. If she can open the box, literally. What's inside the box? That's a freaking quill. You did it. You're the first person in history to buy lock picks. They're so common. I know, I keep forgetting to feel like glue. Hi, do you want a quill? I presume you're bothering me for a good reason. I've found the quill. Really? I wrote that off a long time ago. Well, I suppose I need to fulfill my end of the bargain. Yes. Give this document to Vol. It frees him from the debt. But I never want to see him in Rifton again. Oh, okay. Oh, that's Exile. That's not very nice. He's made his pals here. Do you want to reconsider Exile on someone? That's not very nice. Have you heard of that? Have you heard how damaging that can be to someone's social life? Makes him feel like they're not a part of the community. You have to, you know, uproot and go elsewhere. Not nice. He's trying to suck it at Skyrim. I know. You, come here. I can't talk to him yet or he'll be aggressive. Like, you. Here, over here. What? What? Or Big Vault. Sorry, Big Vault. Oh, oh, he's going to that gate. Hold on. If we're fast enough, if we're fast enough, we can go. We can go talk to him on the other side of that gate. Vault. Vault, hold on. Vault. Vault, it's me. It's me. No, no, no. He's come back to the original position. No, Vault, no. Wait, Vault, wait. Let me talk to you. I just want to talk to you. I just want to talk to you. I just want to talk to you. I just want to talk to you. I just want to talk to you. Vault. Vault. Oh. I have something for you. Here, it's your debt with Maven. You're free. What are you doing? How's he added? Are you just coming out now? Oh, he is. Oh. Okay, thank you. Thank you very much. Can I just come in this way? Oh, it's barred. Wait. I need a bow and arrow. Or can I just hit this? Okay. No, you need a bow and arrow. I was being a bit... Let me just... Tada. That's how you get the ramp down. Super fuss. He's skipping town, no reason. Hmm. I just subbed to all the girls account. Heck, you did. We love supporting genmates out here. Oh, Delinia, you animal. Literally finishing off the kill. She said, nah, I want to be the reason for death on the death certificate. Jeez, Louise girl. The bar is locked in place and cannot be opened. Okay. Uh, any money? Garnet, I'll take you. I can sell it for... some money. Statue of Debala, how about that? Can I move that one? Nope, can't move that one either. Okay, um, I'll just stop touching things in this house then, I guess. I guess I'll go F myself. Wait. What? This isn't the end. Hold on. Right here? Ah, um, yeah. Wait, I'm not touching anything else. Suspicious clothes. Honestly, I wouldn't have figured that out more. Ah, if the game didn't help. Little cheeky alien potion. Oh. Oh, what's this? Oh, I have no idea what this is. That looks like a trap. Lydia, Lydia, Lydia, stop standing on stuff, Lydia. Lydia, Lydia. Oh, I'm getting sliced in days. Hold on. Oh. I'm getting absolutely chopped up. Oh, and there's poison darts. Mine. Goodness. You need to relax. Oh, my God. Mine. Okay, I've got that. What's this? Eh. What even? Why is this book? I have curiosity. What's the contents of this book? I've never actually read it. Lift her tail. Certainly not, kind sir. I am here to clean your chambers. Is that all you have come... Is that all you have come here for? Little one, my chambers. I have no idea what is you, implying master. I am but a poor Argonian maid. Bro, what? So you are my dumpling. And a good one at that. Such strong legs and shapely tail. You embarrass me, sir. Fear not, you are safe with me. I must finish my cleaning, sir. The mistress will have my head if I do not. Cleaning, eh? I have something for you right here. Polish my spear. But it is huge. It could take me all night. Plenty of time. My sweet plenty. I've never fricking read that. Oh, my God. That's hilarious. Many thanks. Not certain how you managed to get your hands on this item we discussed, but I'm more than pleased. I thought you'd simply wait until transported to Castle Devorah to its final destination, but according to what I've heard, it vanished right from their armory. I wish I knew how you were able to slip by the guards, bypass the porticolas, unlock the armory door and break in at the door of a puzzle locked chest. You need to teach me that little trick sometime. I've left your cut in the usual drop spot and might have another drop where you soon are. There's three more books of it. Oh, my God. I knew the books existed. Wait, what am I doing? Egg spare. Can we do it? Okay. But we have it. Easy. Easy. Okay, a bit more, I think. Or maybe it was left, I don't know. Okay, maybe it's left. Do you know that? Easy. Easy. I'm getting nervous. Easy. Alright, we got children. I'll take children. Not a bother at all. Not a bother at all. The rat wave. Let's go. I don't remember what way to go. Is it this one? Oh, no, this is if you want Dragonborn. Oops. Can you stop attacking me? Whoa, your bull. It's an imperial bull. I think an imperial bull is better than what I've got right now. Although mine does have burn damage, so... I wish YouTube had other emotes. I know. YouTube is like very slowly catching up to the appeal of... I'm not doing any more lock picking on that now. YouTube is very slowly catching up to what the appeal of Twitch is. To the point where it is going to take over Twitch. I'm sorry. It just is. Why did I jump down? I've just added so much time to this travel. I did not recall how long it takes to place Skyrim. We're literally not even finished one questline yet. Tear him up, Lydia. Okay, there we go. Emmy's Rats. I'm so confused. Where did that come from? I dropped down there. Okay. There you go. Channel emotes soon. Channel emotes literally less than 24 hours. Have fun. Am I supposed to speak to Brineo? Okay. You know what? If I had that selected, that probably would have gone a lot faster than what I just did there. Underestimating the 1000 plus hours game. Literally, I was like, right, we'll do the Thieves Guild. We'll do Dark Brotherhood. We're literally six hours into this stream. I've less than six hours and I've not even finished Thieves. Oh, sorry. Sorry. I got a bit excited there. I apologize. Okay. Let's do that. How much? How many? How much heavy am I? Curry? Wait, it's 2.18 out of 3.30. That'll do. I need like a hundred stuff. Hi, Carlaya. How long do we have? Yeah, less than six hours because of this. Oops. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Oops. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. No. Why is two people inviting me to talk? There's too many people. Wait. So do you do every sequel? No. I was just going to do Thieves Guild. Black. Assassins. What? That's not what they're called. The Dark Brotherhood. And then The Vampire. And then The Mean Quest. And I've done nothing yet. So I don't think it's happening. Dark Brotherhood. Yes. Hybrony of Smashes Into Wall. The Trinity of Streams on YouTube. YouTube Shorts of Recycles Clips with 10 Minutes Highlights on the same platform. And also just a cheat for exposure. Yeah, like Twitch is exposed. It's very interesting to see breakdowns on either website. Like, I've just... Meet Karlai at the Sanding Zone. Okay, we're about to become a Nightingale. I know I've literally skipped through all the dialogue. So for anyone who hasn't consumed Skyrim and is listening in at home, I apologize greatly. I can just give you the TLDR. I'm more than happy to provide such a thing for you. How the heck do I get out of this area? I'll just go out of the docks. How about that? I don't think you can jump over. If you haven't played Skyrim, go play Skyrim. Mind yourself. Mind yourself. I'd be a Rifting Guard. I'd be like, yeah. You stink. Don't be causing trouble. Ooh. Hi, Maul. Any news involving the Dark Brotherhood? Oh! That's the other... That's the Brotherhood Quest. Well, that was lucky we talked to him to get that, because we probably just have to kill Grelok the kind. And she's actually not very keen. What's this? Oh, it's a clay deposit. The Thieves Guild quest line is mostly yapping at this point. Honestly, we're about to become Nightingales, and it's about to be yap-yap-yap-yap-yap. I thought I was a good yapper. Mm-mm. Yap-yap-yap-yap-yap-yap. Hello. Hiya! I'm glad you're here. I'm glad you're here. What's the significance of this place? This is the headquarters of the Nightingales. Cut into the mountainside by the first of our kind. See? We've come to seek the edge we need to defeat Mercer Frey. Okay, yeah. What kind of an edge? What kind of an edge? If you'll follow me, I'll try to explain on the way. Yeah. This way, please. Yeah, let's edge this way, please. Oh, look at them steps. Mm, look at that bow, though. Actually, one level. Look at the satchel that the arrow's going. I like how they're coded to look like what the arrow is. Very nice. Very, very nice. I never believed that it existed. I took enough and I'm back. Are you surprised I'm still on? Is Emi streaming today? Emi? Or is it? No, Emi should already be on. Azur should be coming online in two minutes. If I have my times correct. Emi's off today. Just Sheevie and Mercy, so Mercy's on at one. Right, we'll redirect into Mercy. Deal? I'll make you a deal. We'll redirect into Mercy. Yeah, but we're in the Nightingale like Robin Hood or something? I, the first time I did this, like the Nightingale quest, I was in love with Lady Luck. I absolutely just... Ow, I was very loud in my ear. Hopefully that wasn't too loud in your ear. I just absolutely and truly adored the little plot. I like so cool. I just look so amazing and awesome. Everything, I am ready for the oath. Now you go get changed. Best looking armor in the game. Honestly, this armor and Dark Brotherhood armor, yeah. That's awesome. I think we should trust the lass and take the deal. I may have misheard you, but Mercy is in three hours. No one. Yeah, no, Mercy comes online at one o'clock for me. One o'clock in the afternoon, yeah? That's when Mercy comes online for me. So, Mercy's actually perfect for us. An arrangement must be struck. So dramatic. What time did I start streaming? Oh, you started streaming, yeah? At 4 a.m., yeah? I started at 4 a.m. You never wondered why everyone's schedule has a cheeky time zone that no one uses, because that's my time zone. Straining on those night hours, yeah? Yes, I will become Nightingale. Yes, I'm ready. Please stand on the western circle. Holy crap, 4 a.m., yeah? The reason why I stream so early is in case I need to do stuff during the day. Originally, it was either I stream at 4 a.m. or I stream at 10 a.m. But the problem is, if I stream at 10 a.m., the day is over by the time I finish my endurance streams. So, I wouldn't be able to do doctor's appointments if I need to make it. Lydia, you're going to ruin this so much. Please stand elsewhere. Or just go... Lydia, you're going to ruin this scene so much. I'm not being funny. Come here, Lydia. You're going to ruin the awesomeness of this scene. Lydia. Wait here. Thank you. There's such a beautiful cinematic coming up and they don't know what it is yet. Just let it happen. Oh, not Lydia standing in the corner, right? Just don't look at her. Don't acknowledge her, okay? She's like a dinosaur. Alright, let's enjoy this because this is actually pretty cool. I've come before you to throw myself upon your mercy and to accept responsibility for my failure. You're already mine, Carlisle. Your terms were struck long ago. What could you possibly offer me now? I have two others that wish to transact the oath to serve you both in life and in death. You surprise me, Carlisle. This offer is definitely weighted in my favor. In my favor. I ain't saying none of this. What's the next? Monka. Wait, we don't get to see her? I didn't see her. Norm, I thought we got to see her. I guess it's with the next cinematic. What do you mean, we? Yes, it's true, Crane. He's done more. The Scaly Key. Big Scaly. So the key doesn't lock any doors. The three sounds like no one should possess it. It's too much power for one human to have. We see her when we return the key. Yes, we will do that. First time I've ever set out to return something? Let's go then. Alright, Big Brinny, what's up? Oh my God, he's tapping his feet. Oh, he's doing the Irish dance for us. After we deal with him, all that remains is restoring the guild to its full strength. As a result, there won't be anything that you have attention to. I've been at this game a long time, my friend. A long time. I've stolen trinkets from nobles, and turned priests for murder. I'm good at what I do. Maybe even one of the best, but it's all I know. It's on your words, but your foot is moving and it's making me laugh. It's about time. No, it's not right. I don't know what to say. So don't get sentimental on me now, I accept. We'll handle the details. Oh, we have quite the task ahead. Then let's get to it. What if we try to use the key on strongy? And in playing, you don't have free reign of me? Reef playing, you know me better than that. Lydia, I'm sorry that I put you in exile. Yes, follow me. My thing. I can't believe I made myself Lydia 2.0. Strongy using the key on reefing? It's funny, you think you have any resistance against me. Roy is regaining his own foot in the way he tap him. Here. Oh yeah, becoming the guild master is bugged if you don't do the radiant quest first. Oh, I've always managed to do them after. I don't even know how they... Where the heck do you expect me to go? Eh, let's do that then. Strongy, considering you don't have many lockpicks, it may be beneficial just to hold on to it for a while. Honestly though. Right, I need to go a little to the left. Not to be confused with the hit steam game. A little to the left. Let's get to it. If I can get up this hill, then the enemies in that building won't be able to annoy me. Why would I resist strongy? Exactly, why would you? Anyone who puts up with me? Anyone who puts up a fight gets... Twice as hard. Hopefully you can figure out what the substitute was for that word. That's terrible. Wait, that's north. I'm going the wrong way. No, it's like along the waterfront. And just what? Sounds good. Hi, strongy. Dang, you're going hard into this game. We haven't even finished one quest lane yet. It's officially been six hours and I haven't finished one quest lane. I completely forgot how just humongous what this game is. It's extraordinary that I haven't actually... I'm about to get close to finishing the thieves. But even then, I'm not even going to truly finish them due to the reason of... of what? Of... Because we're not even going to do those miscellaneous quests for the Thief's Guild to restore it to its final glory. Cause... Do I take the lift here? No, I still don't take the lift. Keep the skeleton key for yourself. No, I'll be a good girl because I want to see a mummy nocturnal. I really like her design. I wouldn't mind incorporating... I wouldn't mind. It's a very good design. Now the heck did I get where I'm going? Literally every time I have to go somewhere I just start spamming E on a hill and I'm like, is this where I'm supposed to go? No, I don't really have to walk up the hill yet. No, I don't have to walk up the hill. It's fine. It's fine. I saw that orbing. I'm not sure if I should resist or not. Either way, the outcome is clear. The hard... Oh, I thought it was the wind. It was rules. You don't need the key when you get a log pick into a hundred. Oh, I didn't mean that. Does everything just become easy piece of lemon squeezy? Or do the log picks not break on a hundred or something? We're getting there. We can do it. I believe in us. We're just a little exhausted. I'm scarous. I thought for some reason you said I'm scouse and I was like, right? Now what? Oh yeah, by the way, I'm scouse. I like the way you talk, Scottish lass. You know, right? Can I buy a cheeky Maccas? Wait, Maccas is Australian term. I can't believe it. We're boarding live here today. Today, we are going to... This place is actually covered in bandits. I cannot for the life of me doing Australian accent. Right, what's this? A gate. Open the gate. Why not? That might come and help me with future... Go on a Maccas run, yeah? Get in void with me, yeah? Oh, I thought I was going to one-shot you. I'm going to be honest. Yeah, yeah, yeah, you can beg for mercy when you're dead. P-pop-pop... Oh, I bonked him. Right, give me that. I will destroy that. What is this? Can someone look this up? What am I supposed to do with this? Flawed Var-la Stone. I don't know what it is. Flawed Var-la Stone. I've never seen them before. before PC seems to have them, Xbox doesn't seem to have them. But Mercedes in three hours! Say a shout out to Mercedes! Sorry, I got a lot of gold itch on my head. I like to see them. Speak to Carlaya. Ooh, they got a good look. Expert is about much, I've done that for souls. Right, the machines drop. Where's Lydia? Lydia, you do this all the time. There should be an enemy that pops out of here, yeah. Oh, that's right, I remember. These guys used to treat me out. I'm actually, I'll tell you what, that was like really loud. I'm going to... ...settings, audio. Is that a bit better on your ears? I feel like whenever that happens, it's so loud. A new hand has touched the beacon. Now, these do drop, yeah. That's exactly what I'm wanting, like tons of these soul gems. Where's the enemy? I love the enemy. Just got an enemy. Ooh, hold on. My two hands is 46. We're getting there, we're getting there. Yes, oh my goodness. This is what we want, like massive amounts of these soul gems. And then we can put like really good stuff on. There should be one that pops out of here. Yeah. Oh, I'm getting too good. I'm genuinely too good at this game, I'm sorry. The fact that I remember from childhood, where the enemies like come out. I'm not sure how scared I was with the enemies. Come here. Okay, there we go. What was that, three to scavenge? Oh, I'll take it, I'll take it. I'll take it, I'll take anything. I'm happy with anything, any offerings I'll take. Oh, yeah. Is the enemy from here? Here. Oh, I heard that. I heard them like spidering up here. I can hear enemy. Oh, I heard two just one in there, but I need to go here. They're so tiny. They're so tiny. Oh, we are getting so many soldiers. This is exactly what I was needing, one of the runs in here. That spawn sneak is actually impressive. Ah. There, them. Okay, we can destroy that. Yeah, let's go. Alchemy, Arvin. Yeah, yeah, I'll take the potions, let's go. Oh my god, I just jumped in real life because of that noise of that latch. Oh, oh, oh, oh. Oh, hello. I hope you aren't too late. Oh, those bandits back there. Dot, dot, dot. Mm-hmm. I had the brap lever literally jump scare of me. Oh, he really got me there, didn't he? Oh, soul gems. We love soul gems, soul gems, soul gems, soul gems. Oh, wait, is this the thing? I'm supposed to watch him. Look, there he is. Look through the bars. I'm trying to, where is he? I'm pretty sure he pops out somewhere here. And this is a, this is an instance report. I've returned to continue watching. Where? Oh, there he is, there he is. That's Mercer. Look, I'm crawling over. Look at this little cinematic. I like how they just expire right now. Oh, they didn't even move a sword. Eyelash, and we'll be ready for him. Man, the FOV is so low. Do you get motion sickness? No. I'm very lucky, Mercy says she gets motion sickness playing video games. Not to be dramatic, but I think I would end it. Oh, God, I think there's a farmer around here. What's this? Potions. Lutions and potions. I do love a good, I do love a good collection. Isn't there a farmer here? No? Empty? Oh, found him. Found him. And I have course of poison. What does he draw? Skibertail, nah, you're good. You, I want your soul gems. Who am I perishing? Why is Mercer such a poofy poofy? Oh! I just smacked myself into a wall at low health. Okay, that'll do. I think I'll be okay now. That was a jump scare and a half. Okay, we're fine. We're fine. We're fine. Actually, it's probably really good that I have that on a panic because it gets me away from the enemy really quickly. The heck is this? Let's just stop. Oh, I need to go up. Excuse me. The freaking blades on the ground took all my eggspear. Are we having a troll? That's, eh? And where's the other lever? Excuse me, Brynjolf, you're just smacked me in the... That's the other lever there? Behind an eggspear? That can't be right. Surely not. But it is. That can't be right. Don't you have the skeleton key? No, we've not done that part. But that is it. Well, good thing I don't have a smurf it, but what? Wait. Oh, that's not the lever at all. Where the heck's the first lever? Is it here? Where's the second lever? Reveal yourself. What? Oh, there it is. Oh, it's adjacent to the other lever. Oh my god. Then you can go all the way back again. Out my way, out my way, out my way, out my way. I'm not that fast. I'm not that fast. Hold on, hold on, I need to cheat. I'm not that fast. I was gonna say, putting something behind an eggspear level thing is wild. That wasn't it? Okay, I was gonna say that has to be it. I refuse. A little cheeky chess. I'm being trolled by this game. I'm being trolled. I'll destroy that, and then I can get more thingy. Are we there yet, bruv? I feel the same. We've literally not even finished one quest line. I'm ready to make another cup of tea. All right, you can stealth this area, but I'd rather just go for it. I'd rather just go for it. Earthquake, cheeky bit of an earthquake. By the Pope, who's there? Identify yourself. There is a chess down below, but I'm not really fast right now. I want to finish one quest line. One quest line is all I ask. Stop it. You're so stinky. Okay, hold on. You got something. Shaman's key. What was this? The shaman's key, dude. Oh, is it for that? You know what? I might be the chest. No, it's not. Well, I'm not looting it then. Go away. I don't know what the heck the shaman's key is for. Clapham stinky lining, honestly. I mean, how do you come back from that? Someone calls you stinky. You have no way of coming back, truly. It's over for you. Just admit it. There's traps everywhere. Isn't there a massive Centaurian coming up? My brains just reminded me that there's like a big enemy coming soon. What does that say? Bruv, the game thinks I can read that? Mercer, it's backwards. Mercer is on the bottom. One, two. Why is that backwards? I can read Mercer as backwards. I don't mind the stinky. I don't mind the wise. What, an air? Why is it backwards? I'll take these scrolls because I can sell them for money. This is very real. Oh, dear. Right, can you jump the Centaurian and not me, maybe? Oh, goodness, gravy. Some of these enemies. Am I right, fellas? Oh, my fellas. Oh. Oh, hold on. Hold on, right, there you go. All right, I should probably go to sleep. See you next time. Rest well, those who sleep. Please don't worry if you do need to go to sleep again. Bit of a cheeky endurance stream. Mercer is going live in T-minus less than three hours. We are going to raid Dinter because my Skyrim escapades got cut short due to the fact that, oh, I am moving so fast. I am successfully avoiding all the traps laid out. Yes, I don't know why achievements aren't popping up. I'm literally using Xbox Game Pass right now, so it's kind of the... I'm not sure what the dealio is, but I'm quite happy just to play through the... Thingamabobber and tomorrow's monetization celebration. So I guess I can enjoy like a more relaxed for my boys. Oh, come on. Oh, come on. Get a rest. Oh, I'm low health. Oh, I'm low health. I'm about to get altered by a spider. Hold on. Okay, there we go. Go around to read it. Go around it to read it. Oh, is there like another room that makes a lot more sense if there was like something behind it? Me here just ignored it and chose to be confused. Oh, give me that. Oh, orcishbowl and ice. Oh, and alchemy. Resurrect and restore my energy. Mmm. Alchemyxing like a DJ. Give me them juicy soul gems. That's all I want. That's all I crave. I just want soul gems. Oh, I might get one of you. No. Okay, okay. You guys don't need to perfectly follow me. You do realize that, right? But we can do this. And we completely missed them because we alerted the enemies to our location. Okay, there we go. Oh, my God, he's beat. He jumped in me. I'm actually beating that. I wasn't beating him. God, they have so much venom. So much venom. Don't mind if I do it. What on earth were they doing? Sheebie, what have you been doing in your dungeon? These last words? Oh, my God, that's brutal. Hold on. These last words. Nobody thought they were real, but I've seen them in the eyes of the snow elves. The dwarves thought they took them from the Thawmer, but they themselves were fooled. A statue built in secrecy by the slaves. The eyes burn into you, and I see them even now. Sarafa escaped through the collapsing tunnel, but he'll never escape what we've seen. Men will never believe him, and he'll be driven mad by the knowledge that he'll never see them again. But I may yet see them again before I die. Wow, that was strange. Johnny's a soul gem addict. Literally, they're like the most OP leveling up system. I'm just going to blast through this area because there's a massive flamethrower, I think, or something. How am I detected if I'm around the corner? Why are you going for me? He's right there. Literally, right. Actually, I just remembered Mercer drops are really good. Two-handed sword, and we already got children. Yeah, that's right. Spank that rat on the fire. Oh. Oh, let's go. Oh, my fellows. Oh, I'm getting... Yeah, okay. I was the same kind of blasted by this. We may yet to see Johnny's eyes before we die. I might need to heal. Or I might get a wave of thought. Ooh, we've been... Oh, I got detected. I keep going, like, all right. I'll finally go sneak, and then I get detected because I'm not paying attention. Touch this. Eat this. Fun fact, the Dwemer and Elden Scrolls are not doors, but actually, a type of elf. Two-handed. He isn't a drill wielder. Exactly. Imagine not being a drill wielder. I can't relate. I've tried so many times to be an archer, but I just can't do it. Like, especially when the enemy come up in your face and you've got a bow and arrow, it's like, bro, wouldn't actually be so furofuro. I think that actually does more damage to the mother. Wait, can I get them to deal with the enemies? Oh, my God, that's so cool. I can, like, go through here. Is there, like, a treasure chest or something? Or is this just, like, a hurry up? Oh, wait, that symbol. That means there's loot here? I don't see no loot. Or does it just mean that the thieves' guild was here? Huh? I'm so confused. I feel like there may have been something I missed, but hey-ho. All right, let's get to it. Everybody get to it. To it. Let's get this part. It started. Let's get the foam. Departed. Mercer was here. Shield one-handed is perfectly viable. Thank you very much. Probably. What do they hold? So they just kind of hold a lot of, like, mix and stuff. That's interesting. I guess a few were more into, like, the alchemy side of things. Oh, master a lot. Right, I'm not bothering. Saw his bot on your bike. Mm-hmm. Hydration check. Oh. Wow! Such a ship. Mm-hmm. Yeah, give me the key, Mercer. The water's rising. Uh... I don't believe you, no. Turtle gates me. My new friend leaking. Both of us lie, cheat, and steal. Oh! Dun, dun, dun. The difference is, I still have honor. If anyone falls, it'll be you, Mercer. Nightingale. Uh, I can't remember if this is hard or not. Oh, no, he got wallets. Oh, he's got blood drain. Oh, my God. Oh, where is he? I can just see the red doll. I'm chasing the red doll. I'm not even... There he is! I found him! Hello! Hello! I got him. He's got... Whoa, he's got like... Yeah, I'll take all that. Shit, give me everything. Oh, I'm carrying too much to be able to run. Uh... Oh, sorry, hold on. Sorry, excuse me. Just need to drop a few things that I don't need. I don't need an embalming tool. I can show you that much. Uh, don't need random chunks of ore. That's fine. A wall? It looks like a ship. Is that a tap? Yeah, don't need all these random miscellaneous things. That's fine. Ingredients that could probably eat all the little ones and clear up some side space stuff, I guess? Unknown, unknown. Sorry, guys. I know the cave is collapsing. It's very important I have a little taste test of all these ingredients. I assure you. Food? Yeah, sure. I'm just freaking loaded up. Am I light yet? No, I'm not light yet. Holy crap. Okay, uh, right. What do we not need? That does say 26, not gonna lie. Oh, I forgot to... That one's better. I don't want to, like, drop it, though. I feel like I can sell it for, like, decent money, honestly. Um... I guess we'll just drop that shit. Orcishbowl, 11, playing... These don't really give me much money. Okay. So don't panic. I know the cave is literally... Why is it... Oh, I know the cave is, like, perishing and it's falling with war. But don't panic, guys. Everything is okay, alright? You just have to let it fill. Oh. Oh, he... Oh, he hit the quad. The quad. Oh, are you guys okay? Do you guys need to breathe? No? No, you don't need to breathe? Okay. You don't have to. If you look above the head of the elf, you'll notice those rocks look very suspiciously movable. That's because they are. You have a keen eye. Refling, you have a keen eye. Strongly to taste test all the new alchemy ingredients. Literally, like, trying to, like, release. Some of the weight in my inventory. And I'm like, hmm, yes, hmm. This moth wing is the whole... What a delicacy. You just have to wait. Unfortunately, you can't, like, swim upwards. It doesn't do it the way you want it to. So it's a bit awkward. But yeah. I remember the first place where I was trying to, like, swim through these pipes. I was like, yes, the pipes, the pipes will save me. But it should do one big collapse. There you go. Take it long enough, honestly. And then you just gotta wait until it gets high enough to get up there. To shift the weight in my body eats 50 cheese wheels. We are aquatic. Let me eat some too. Stopping to release, yes, there. Hmm. But it's faster you get out of that cave the easier the game. Briff. Briff. I have completely forgotten how much the NPCs love to talk to you. Five, eight, nine. No! Carlisle! It's not simple. Sepucar. I've never said sepucar. Are you ready to take a pilgrimage together? Then we'd best get started. You need to protect the king. I'm afraid you'll have to face the end of your journey alone. Take this with you. I'm not certain if it will help within the walls of the sepucar. I've had this for the most time. And I haven't let me down. I hope it brings you the same path. I'll literally yank the HP off him. Can we serve Strony in other ways? Absolutely. It depends what your offering is to me. Aw, I've not even been a folk wreath yet! Actually, you know what? I need to destroy and enchant a few things to sell on. So I'm gonna go do that now and it will free up a lot of inventory. Is Carlaya the same VA as Shadowheart? I cannot tell you that. I don't know. Baldur's Gate is such a good review, though, that I'm really tempted to play it for the first time on stream. I'm worried in case I'm so dumb I can't figure it out, but hopefully it's a full-proof game. Anyone can just jump in on the fun. This is what I want. Devouring, archery, and potions. Everything else can be sold. You heard it here first. Did I even have a big gem? I do! Yes! Did I make it craft? Yes! That was bloody good shoo. That bloody good shoo. Right, where's that? Okay. So what? Just enchant random stuff now for the XP, I guess? Turn Undead. Frost Damage, here, why not? Petty Soul Gem. Yeah, I'm just going to put Petty Soul Gem stuff on it. And then I know I can sell everything in my inventory. God, look at the level up is so fast. This game is so forgiving. Just the noise. It's just constantly like... We'll put all of this stuff on. And then we can get a pretty penny. Oh, we might be able to buy the home. We might be able to buy our home in Riften. And then we can have our little flower garden out in front. We can't get chickens though. Not yet. Baldur's Gate 3 is good and you can do whatever you want. It's not really wrong way of playing it. Baldur's Gate is really open and rewarding. I'm glad. Um... I can't figure it out. Also, it tells us, please backseat me. You'll be fine. Yeah, some folk really are so strongly like a little bit backseat gaming. I'm actually going to travel to Riften just to sell some stuff because my inventory is getting a bit too full. Now, as much as I like being full and, you know, a bandaid slapped on top. Not like this. What is this? You! I would like to sell some weapons that are very heavy. I will keep children. I'll put it elsewhere. I don't want to sell that stuff. I'd rather keep it in the prowl. I can sell, like, all of it right here at Money's. I will remember that. You can marry the butcher. He's not butcher. He's a blacksmith making all that. Those wires are really crossed on me. Please take... Please take some of my stuff that I don't need. Thanks. Appreciate it. Created potions are 1% more per... Wait, no, actually, I'm going to keep the diamonds and stuff on me. The reason for that is because you can get, like, Miscellaneous Quest to ask for that basic stuff. How about you? Everything I've got on display, really. We're going to get rid of all this. This should really lighten the load. I don't want to sell that thing. Oh, I completely forgot I had, like, all those... That must... Oh, he's not going to go left. Oops. Oops, I'm giving away things for free. Oopsies. Oopsies. Teehee. Little teehee moment. Right, we'll go Falkreath and then we'll hit up Twilight's... La-la-la-la-la. Strangely, I will remember everything you said. Bear, no. I even don't want to say half the time. I'm just here for a good time. Do you remember when we almost got our head chopped off? Yeah, and I was taken over by bandits and burnt to a crisp. Teehee, not my problem. Teehee. Strangely, Ever dropped a bunch of jewelry in the shopping centre in Riften. Everyone starts fighting over stuff you drop, and, like, it literally terminates NPCs, and it's, like, the proof. I've need them for quests. That's the one thing I could absolutely obliterate Skyrim for, is if a quest requires an NPC, do not let them be perishable. Do not let them expire. I am so sad. What the heck is... Oh, no! The wolves jump these poor people, and the one wolf perished them both. That's what you get for trying to execute an innocent dragonborn. Some of them are marchers. Yeah, like, some NPCs can't be perishable, but if they have a quest, I feel like they shouldn't be able to expire at all, because it's so annoying when you're, like, trying to do it, and then it's, like, all surprised, by the way. Oh, who are you? Hello. Mummy, Goo Goo Gaga Azura. Mummy. Any mummies. We'll make it a little tea break. A little tea break? Is that allowed? Is that permitted? And then I'm going to get a wee snack as well. A bit of a little cup of tea, a little bit of water. Yeah, I'm starting to think we're getting, like, absolutely nothing done. We're pretty much looking at T-minus two hours. I've been live for almost seven hours. I've yet to finish the quest. Right, fault creases here. What the heck is that? Bro, you cannot drop rocks on people's heads. I cannot tell you how inappropriate that is. I am home with my mummy. We drink milk and tea up in this place, of course. Literally, how have I been at this for seven hours? I'm not completed one quest. Something's not adding up. I don't know. Like, I'm pretty sure the Skyrim World record is, like, two hours. Like, one hour and 52 minutes or something. Ridiculous like that. And you're telling me in seven hours, near seven hours, I couldn't finish one quest line. Well, I need sleep. Good night. Thank you for hanging. No promises. I won't see you in my dreams. That's right. Get Scottish. Get Scottish. Get Scottish. Your only dream of a Scottish. The Highland Cows call you. Ooh, I don't want to walk over a grave. That's bad luck. There's a lot of graves. What's going on in fault grief? I feel like that's probably a quest, because that's a lot. Scotland, forever. A little tricky thing. Get Scottish. Get Scottish. Get Scottish. I think I need to do that. Someone did that where it was like, get pregnant, get pregnant, get pregnant. And it's like, do you didn't see it? Like, really intense music. I want to do that, but like, get Scottish. Get Scottish. Get Scottish. We're almost there. We're almost there. We're almost there. We're just going to run a little bit longer. Oh, there's castles and ruins. Did you know you can just straight up buy castles in Scotland? Fun fact, you can literally look up them online. Just type in Castle for sale in Scotland. I'm not even kidding. It's pretty intense and cool. And you can buy churches. It's a lot cheaper to live in a church, an ex-church, by the way. You can literally, it's like churches for sale in Scotland. Yeah. Just have a look. It's like way cheaper. Shawnee, have you heard of the Scott Wikipedia vandalism story? Yes. Oh, we should talk about it. Like, if you didn't know, so Scots is basically slang. And we say things very phonetically. And someone, whoa, I didn't realize you were a bandit. Sorry. Time to go, buddy. Okay. And someone basically went, oh, I'll just rewrite this in Scots. But he, like, wasn't Scottish. So he just wrote what he thought, like, Scottish folks said. And it was just complete gibberish. And he'd been doing it for ages and no one, like, caught him. Wasn't that it? He said in Zillow, Scotland to find an affordable hoose, honestly. It's Gallus. Hello. Hello, Gallus. I visited Edinburgh. Let's go. I'd ask the same question with you. It's really funny. Shawnee's going to buy a castle, move the wheel or team into it, reference to serve them there. But could you imagine, though? Like, oh, you know what, you get out of this exchange? I servited. How are you to blame? Where can I say not? Wait a minute, you're Gallus. I've heard that name in a long, long time. How do you know of me? I'm best pals with your girlfriend. The key. You have the skeleton key. I never thought I'd see it again. How do you say I love you in Scottish? It's just I love you. Like, I love you, and then I love you. It's kind of, like, shoved together in fast. He's that adoring fan. Is he? Biazura, Biazura, Biazura. I did this for Nektoro. I did this for the owner of the guild. Carlaya helped me. Yes, your girlfriend's alive. Well, then she would have appeared here. Then take the key and right all the wrongs. When we put the strongens or cult leader, we could cut taxes and save money. Yay! We can be tax exempt together. Yippee! How can I, how can a spirit die? The sepulchre isn't nearly a temple or a vault to house the key. Within these walls is the ebony. The ebony? A bit of an ebony. When Mercer stole the key, that conduit closed, severely limiting our... Maintaining a historical site for tax breaks and profit? Yeah! And then we run, like, a massive B&B over. Oh, my God. Oh! I'm afraid so. I'm weakening. And I can feel myself slipping away. The years without restoration of my power I had taken their toll. You really want to mess with the IRS? That should be a song. You really want to mess with the IRS? I fought the law in the law one. Ray. I will go. Good luck, Gallus. Even if you don't have to do anything, that's okay, I'll do it all. I don't mind doing the hard work, right? Who needs a bastion? Who needs a bastion? Who's begging for the pagan? Because it's all happening at once. Let's go! I bet he do. Beat him up, beat him up, beat him up! Beat him up! Ay! Ay! Ay! Oh, wow. They're actually kind of beef. They're actually a bit stronger than your average enemy. Hold on a minute. I don't like that. Where's... You, come here. No. I'm stuck on the stairs. Hold on. I'm stuck on... Ow! Ow! Stop! Swap to weapon, Ray! Stop to melee! Yes, there you go. Okay, there we go. Jeez, I lose. What is in you? Arrows? So, Gem! Alchemy! Totally not secret, backtracking. I do love Skyrim for that. It's quite... It's quite rather entertaining. Okay, they've got elven arrows on their persons, which is pretty... Ugh. Whoa, why are you so scary? I'm not gonna lie. Like, they're kind of messing me up now. Open our own velar colony? What? In the Scottish countryside with crops and feudal lordship for the growth? Bruh. Look, sometimes a sense of community is all you need. Wait, I'm to stay in the dark. Right, if you stay in the dark, your health doesn't get... Well, wasn't paying attention to that. Was I? Clearly, no? Uh, yeah, you just need to stay in the dark so you don't get hurt in this section. It's not really too bad at all. I just can't see nothing in it at all. Oh! It's just a wee bit of poison. Just a few darts in my eyeballs. It's fine, it's fine. I can still see for the most part. Hee hee. I wish I wore my glasses. Ah, we did it! Hey! Woo! Let's go. What's this? Ah! My lady! Hello! Oh! A bandit got all the way here. Hello, my lady. Please ignore the fact that I'm taking your offering. So fragmented, I don't need that. Uh, uh, behind here is two chains to pull. Gammy! Atlas! Where's Blossom? Where's Gammy? That's Gammy, the girl. And that's her dad, Atlas. And Blossom's her mummy. Hmm. Is it true if you buy Landon Scott, you become a lord? No, that is completely false. Um, if you take that in, by the way, you'll actually... What on earth? Um... Hello! Ow! Oh my god, I just got reeled by a log. That wasn't really that fun, I'm gonna be honest. Right, we did it. We did it. We're here, we're here. Snowberry's waiting on Aces every need. Penpal's being picked for a set of me. Oh, it's all spooky, it's all spooky and purple. Oh, I love the color scheme. Oh, I remember this. Oh no, I'm stuck. I should read his note. Anderson's, Andrew's message. I can't believe it, I came all this way, solved all of those ridiculous riddles, just to end up here. After I memorized Nystrom's clues, he'd collected from Letheus, isolate his throat. Now I guess the joke's on me, because I'm stuck here and I don't see a way out. Hope someone comes by soon, I'm getting hungry. I don't think he made it, chief. I don't think he made it. Yeah. If only we had some sort of... key? Some sort of skeleton... key? Yep. Oh. Oh, I'm stuck. What have we got? Oh, yes. Gammys! Look at all Gammys babies! Oh, I'm the wrong way, sorry Hen. Tell me that ain't good design. Excuse me, will Stylical around? Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Nothing more than the fulfillment of your agreement. We must stay focused, Reeflings. We must stay focused. I wish you to drink deeply from the Evermere mortal. Or this is where the agent of Nocturnal is born. Drink? The oath has been strong. The die has been cast. And your fate awaits you in the Everglow. Bye-bye, Mommy! What? Where did you come from? Hello? Sorry. Oh, sorry. Oh, sorry. Can I talk to you now? Yes. Uh, please, she sounded indifferent. I assure you that she'd been displeased with you. We wouldn't be having this conversation. What's this about becoming an agent and a Nocturnal? The crescent moon represents the agent of shadow. The crescent moon, I think, is what we want. In the full moon, for the agent of strife. This is Nocturnal's role in maintaining balance. How is this goddess of stealth when it's clear? With the clap of her cheeks, we'd alarm the guards on a 500 meter radius. It's unfamiliar. Her hotness is so powerful. And you? Aww. Aww. The beginning of what? Wow. We're down good at what we do. Uh, I think stealth. Tell me where the crescent moon. Is the most on moonlit nights. Yeah, okay. Well, you do the agent of... Are you a crescent moon? You're a full moon. And you're a half moon. Okay, crescent moon. Okay, now what? Oh no, Gallus is about to come. Ooh, look, it's Gallus and Carnaia. They're gonna kiss. I was afraid she'd become like the others. If it were not for the actions of this Nightingale, she and his would have come true. She would have lost all hope. Nocturnal calls me to the Everglow. My contract has been fulfilled. Will I ever see you again? When your debt to Nocturnal has been paid, we'll embrace what's ahead. How well, Gallus. Eyes open. Walk with the shadows. I've been 25 years since you've seen each other, and this is it. This is what they muster. Are you alright, Carla? Maybe it's just not... She doesn't understand. Oh, he's going to disappear into the bowl of soup. Oh, he's in the bowl of soup, lads. Sorry, I'm sure it's really emotional. What is it? He appeared at Gallus' school in our bowl of soup. The spirit becomes one with the Everglow. Ah. So he's gone. Okay. You drank the ghost soup, honestly. They're a part of the darkness around us. When we say, walk with the shadows, we are asking those nightingales who have passed on to protect us, to believe that they are literally what guides our uncanny luck, by placing their hands in ours. That's why the Evermere needed to be reopened. Without it, there's no way Nocturnal was able to... I'm getting it now. How will I know if I'm needed here? If this place is in danger ever again, the shadows will call. Okay. Where should the need arise? A portal connects the Sepulchre and Nightingale Hall. Use it whenever you wish. Okay. Where will you be? I've decided to make my home at Nightingale Hall. Since it's your home as well. I hope to see you and bring you out there. Of course, I may visit some of Skyrim's cities too. Quiet things from time to time. Can't afford to get rusty now, can we? Well, I'm... I'm satisfied. Yeah, yeah, bye-bye. Okay, thank you. Thank you, hubby-bee. Is this your home now? It is! Okay, so she just hangs out here now. Girl, that's a bit depressive. But anyway, that's all for now. As long as you're having a good time and all that. Thanks for the experience of being in Nightingale. Alright, have a good night and good luck. Thank you! For those of you who need to go rest, please do rest. I am literally farting about... Cause... Mercy is going live in two hours. I'm gonna redirect into her and then it means I can... Do a little bit of... A little bit of preparation for my monetization stream tomorrow. I'll need to actually make the thumbnail. And you get a picture of my frickin' feet for the thumbnail. Omega at low. And... Oh no, what did I do now? Well, we do... Night... Night mother, night mother, send your child unto me for... Oh no, sweet mother. I keep saying night mother. Apparently... It's sweet mother. I could've sworn I turned that on. Man, there we go. Yeah. Group brushing, T minus 90 minutes. Yes. Right. I am going to make a cup of tea. If we would all like to get something to hydrate. Gotta go to Winterhold for that one. Yes. I'm gonna make a cup of tea. And then... We will... See how far we can get on the dark, brotherhood. There's absolutely no way in heck we are getting anywhere close to it. But... It doesn't mean we can't start it, okay? Man, I'll arrive late for tomorrow's stream cause I'll be at work. It's a very short stream tomorrow. It's not Skyrim part two, just... For those of you who may be lurking, there is not a Skyrim part two tomorrow cause I've completely messed up the achievements and the whole point was to do the achievements. And for some reason they're not working even though I am on Xbox Game Pass. But we do have plenty of time in the future. I will definitely come back to Skyrim once I've fixed whatever's going on. Cause honestly, I'm like, should've just played cameo. Sorry, we need to break in here so we can go talk to this kid. Sweet mother, sweet mother, send your child unto me for this soon. Very tired. Oh no. Sweet mother, send your child unto me. So you come in. Munkah. S. Are you alright? The body? She came. An assassin from a dark brotherhood. Ah yes, the black sacrum. A Wang of course. So long. So very long. But now that you're here, you can accept my contract. Your contract? My mother, she... She died. I'm all alone now. So they sent me to the terrible orphanage in Riften on her hall. The headmistress is an evil cruel woman. They call her Grelad the kind. But she's not kind. She's terrible to all of us. So I ran away and came home. And performed the black sacrament. Now we're here. And you can kill Grelad the kind. Sure, buddy. A kiss by the sweet mother. What does the book say? Hand that book over. So you wish to summon the dark brotherhood. You wish to see someone dead. Pray, child, pray, and let the night mother hear your plea. You must perform that most profane of rituals, the black sacrament. Create an effigy of the intended victim assembled from actual body parts, including a heart, skull, bones, and flesh. And circle that effigy with candles. The ritual itself must then commence. Proceed to stab the effigy repeatedly with a dagger, rubbed with the petals of a nightshade plant while whispering this plea. Sweet mother, sweet mother, send your child unto me for the sins of the unworthy must be baptized in blood and fear. Then wait, child, for the dread father sitheth rewards the patient. You will be visited by a representative of the dark brotherhood. So begins a contract bound in blood. That's actually really cool. Oh, I'm quite happy with that. I quite like that kind of back behind the scenes, not behind the scenes because it's like hidden in a book, so it's not behind the scenes. But I like seeing how the game like tried to explain it. It's quite thingy. Where did he find the body part? Oh, he tried his best, okay. Probably went into the crypt or something like that. So this is probably the only instance when you can perish someone in front of a whole group of people. Sorry, Hen. Yeah, you do not get in trouble for doing that. And all the kids... And they're all like laughing at our own stuff. Wait, oh, I've gone the wrong way. Sorry, I've gone the wrong way. We're saved. Yeah, literally one of the only instances you can walk in and perish someone and then come straight back out again. They don't care. No one cares. The Rift and Guards don't even care. They must have known as well. Now, the actual nice lady takes over. Yay! So really, we just did everyone a big ol' favour. I was like finding different fun ways. Apparently you can cast Friendsly in the Children Parish Gray look. I'm not sure if that's true or not. Is she... You know? Like, kinda sounds like Midoriya. What did you give me? You're a child. Completed Innocence Loss. Family heirloom? Oh, sorry, sorry. My bad. I got a little... I just needed to check what your family heirloom was. Is there any? Oh, there is. A plate? A plate. I mean, you are a child, so I guess that makes sense. Now, if I remember correctly, we need to go sleep in a bed. The first sleep the poor dragonborn has had since I started my adventures, so we'll just rent a little bed in here. You ever just accidentally dash across the house, honestly? Oh, you. Hello! Hello! Can you come a bit closer? Okay, I guess not. Yeah, I'd like to rent a room. Thanks, darling. Oh, okay. Oh, 10... 10 stars! Whoa! Hello? My lady? You want to join me? Okay. Right, please stop talking to me. I'm trying to be sure in my room, but I'm having to help the NPC. Okay, there we go. Thank you for showing me my room. If you want the tip, just stay in the room, right? Get in that bed. Don't be ill. It's all right. Absolutely shocking behavior. Please stop. 12 hours. We won't make a cup of tea very shortly. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm getting delirious. Miss Johnny, can I be excused from the history of the Nordic class to use the bathroom? Yes, you're allowed to use the toilet. Right, I am going to go make a cup of tea. What? Was that not supposed to be kidnapped? After you perish? Does it have to be about the island? Huh. Give her to her, kid. It's after you receive a courier's lair. Ah! How are you streaming now? How are you so powerful? I'm not sure. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. What are you streaming now? How are you so powerful? That is called autism. And I love my games. Right, I'm waiting on the courier. Courier, courier. Courier, courier. Give me a letter. Courier, my boss. Right, ah, sorry. I'm going to go get a cup of tea to recalibrate because I have been playing for a hot second. I'm going to have to pause the game sadly because there can be NPC events such as cultists entering the town which can kill NPCs. So I will have it paused whilst I go quickly make a cup of tea. Please do stretch your legs and get yourself a wee water and have a pee. You've got to sleep. No. All right, sorry, man. Yeah, I thought you had to sleep right away but I need to receive the letter with a hand that says we know and then go to sleep, okay? So go for a tinkle. Go get some water. I'm going to get a cup of tea and we're going to recalibrate and come back and meet in the middle. It will be a couple of minutes, okay? I think I can get a wee snack. Right, I'll be right back. Good night. Good night. Good night. Good night. Good night. Good night. Good night. Good night. Good night. Good night. Good night. Welcome to Europe. Oh, wait, I said that wrong. Welcome to Europe, young man. Remember that 10-year-old vision? Remember that 10-year-old vision? Oh. Sorry, that was the worst Dutch I think I've ever done so far. I do apologize to any... ...Nederland-Mensen who are listening in. But everyone else is just like, what on earth are you even on about? Hi. Welcome back. What, you thought I was gone forever? I've got me a cup of tea, and I've actually got strupewafel. I'm not even kidding. I have actual strupewafel. I was supposed to eat it on the rating stream, but I couldn't find any more European snacks. So I'm just literally going to eat a little strupewafel. Welcome back. I love... Strupewafel is like crack cocaine. Sorry, but it's not. Strupewafel is like crack cocaine. Sorry, but it's so good. Um... Yes, mercy for the snippets who are lurking. I appreciate you, even if I'm not your flavor. Um... Tea minus one hour and 40 minutes until your... Kohai is ready to say hi-hi. And prove that she can't whistle. Which is adorable. I can't believe I hired her on the basis she can't whistle. Stop leaving a... What? I'm not allowed to go get a cup of tea? For my boys? What do you mean? You like hearing my words? Like all cranky? Yeah. Are you ending when mercy comes on? Yes, I'm going to redirect into her on purpose because I didn't know I was getting monetization today. So tomorrow we're doing the monetization celebration. So I need to set up like all the emotes and I need to set up on the price. And I think very sadly I have to freaking charge more than 4.99 and I really don't want to charge more than 4.99 US dollars. But I think I might have to because of this YouTube gifting stuff. Can any of yous confirm that YouTube gifting thing is a nightmare or a hassle? I'm going to take a bite of my waffle. I know it's only like 2 cents difference. I just don't like that. Hold on. I'm going to check out marshmallows. If you'd like to send me any marshmallows, I'm just going to take a quick pause champ on top of everything. Jesus Christ. Why do I have so many DMs? Okay. I don't know. Oh good. For the most part. Oh, and now I can't see my mouse again. Okay, marshmallow refresh. Let's go. A lot of follow girls have 1.99 tier and then 4.99 and the gift goes to the 4.99. Would exactly 5 dollars work? I possibly. Hello mummy. You're asking what software baby uses for 3D. It's called Warudo for full body tracking. There's a lot of videos about it. But I think most YouTubers use Sony MoCopy, SlimeVR or Vine trackers. Okay, okay. It's okay mummy. I know you can't open my last Mario link on stream. Don't forget to check later. Is it bad that I check? Like as soon as I go offline, I just spend like another 30 minutes and I'm like, yeah. What's the problem with gifting? So the issue is if someone is very kind to gift, but they can't dictate what type of tier to give, it means outsiders isn't a nice term to use. That's not the correct term. But someone who maybe... What's the word? I'm trying to think. Someone who gets access to membership streams that should name. You know, like someone who's just going to be rude about it or whatever. I don't know. Yeah, use whatever. It's better to have people watching the membership streams that are actually interested because someone might get a message and it's like, oh right, okay. You might be able to turn on gifting entirely. Well, the problem is gifting is a massive money source for the girls. If someone's going to be a shitter in members' content, they better be paying out their own pocket. Ah, that's so funny. I'm sorry, but that's actually such a funny statement. Okay, Strani and fellow reeflings. I'm going to have a fun rest of the stream. Oh, now I need to go. Sorry, fucking words are blending together. I'll see you tomorrow. Yes, I think it'll be roughly two hours. It's a short stream tomorrow, do apologize, but I'm needing overall vocal rest. I've got quite a few VTuber ASMR collabs coming up, so I'm needing to be a good girl and rest and try my best. I am a Spanish reefling and I've been very... No, you've not. Hold on. You've helped me pass some hard times, so I just want to know that if you're really proud of you your streams go... Also, I like how you act on stream about gapping and ranking burps is fun. Se te quiera. What is se te quiera in espa\u00f1ol in English for me, because I don't know what se te quiera means. I think it means. I don't even know. You are truly an anomaly. I've never seen someone who is so intensely thoughtful in caring about both your daughters and reefillings. Yeah, also shameless. Hold on. What am I getting? What am I getting spanked by? It's a level of authenticity. I would never... I would never even see in a person, let alone a VTuber. I wish you all the success in the world. Wow. You did an absolutely fantastic job on the tryharding in the ASMR stream. I can only assume you have a really good coach since it took me over a year to study to get to that level. A coach? Like a hypno coach? No. That's just called autism. In general interest. I just apply what I like to whatever and I do it my way. Also, it's something I would never do otherwise, but my... But my girlfriend has convinced me I should do... Bibbius? So I've printed out 21 pages so I can build some additional cognitive habits. I made a collage by the end of the month. What? What is this? What? Well... What is this? What are these additional cognitive habits? What is this? 21 Bibbius? For me? For me? You have that in you? Right now? It's almost 5 am. Yes, please rest well. For those of you who are hanging on by a thread, we're just going to start off the Dark Brotherhood at this point. I'm going to see if I can fix achievements and possibly we can come back to Skyrim, but tomorrow is being steamrolled by monetization celebration stream. Gotta get those micro plastics out of you somehow, honestly. Hey Lassie, would you kindly raise the model up so you can see more of the girlies? You could zoom out a bit too if you don't want to block too much of the game. Someone said they don't like it. Where is it? I would have to go like this. Does this work? Hold on. Does that work? It does work. That's terrible. I can't really get away with it too much. Let's behave. A tomato a day keeps the other boys okay. Yes, that is our new slogan, ladies and gentlemen. Tomato a day keeps the other boy else okay. I'm still trying to eat the same strip waffle. I'm getting so distracted. So when's the audio of you rambling about assassin's greed or something while getting your... Oh my god, you guys are getting our while. I'm actually doing a review. On Assassin's Creed Brotherhood which should come out around November. Like I'm doing an actual game review footage. Like I'm being so serious on it. So if you like hearing my accent putting you to sleep well I can tell you about Assassin's Creed and how amazing it is. Sometimes I wish we could see the film. They're pretty outrageous. I'm trying my best to like dart around them. But good night rest well those who need to rest. I love Strauner's The Cuttlefish in this hoose. Strauny, if you like V&N games, kind of reckon Valhalla is such a good game and I think you'll like it. I most certainly will check that out. I may have in another life thought I was about to play it and then play the complete wrong game which was called Helltaker I believe. And it was also a puzzle game and I was so confused on why the game looked so different to what I was playing and it turns out I was playing the completely wrong game. But yes, I would love to give Valhalla a try. Hi cuttles, are Mondays and Tuesdays always going to be endurance? No, they are not. It's just a Quinky Dink really that I put on Monday and Tuesday. But no, they're not always going to be the endurance on those days. Yes. Having you laugh about to... Are you squiddin' me right now? By the Pope! I'm going to be so honest. Brian did not help with my confusion on the pronunciation of your name, tiny spainy. What? And you had it right. As spainy is pronounced like a spainy anteater. A spainy anteater or a spiny anteater. Brian just made that ten times worse and I do apologize if I'm now officially butchering it but thank you for the tip. Do it phonetically in chat. Right, so it's either spainy or did I even spainy? So, you know. Spainy. Okay. Spainy. We got there in the end. Literally, I'm renaming everyone who just doesn't have an easy to rename for me. Spiny. There are Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday and Sunday endurance streams. Yes. Mostly the stream stipend. I'll try and do for like a big amount of time because I know not everyone's available at the one time zone, if you will. Having you up about developmental psychology and socially inculcated reactions to stress made me realize I really wish that physical touch and affection was more normalised in society. Especially for men, male socialised people. People need more hugs these days. Also, I'm curious how you deal with the stress and she mentioned you don't know how we do it. I always have a goal or something to work towards which helps distract me from what I'm feeling in the moment and essentially makes me numb and work through it so right now my goal is to help the girls achieve what they want. So I'm like, even though I'm stressed and I'm worried and I'm this and I'm that because they are a much more important focus on my life it's kind of one of those things where I can just put it to the side for now and right, okay, what's next? Once I get offline, I have some lovely VTubers who are waiting on an ASMR collab from me. I have to send away shorts for the girls. I need to record that for them. I need to do... Every word is hard to pronounce. If you're bad enough, for example, I pronounce spatula, spatula. Honestly, I think having a purpose is really useful in general. Yes, I agree with that, I also do it that way. It's so tough to tackle men's socialisation because where does it start? It starts in the home, but then where does it get affected? Secondary socialisation at school. I don't know if you guys had this, but in Scotland it became so quickly, oh that's gay, to show any affection in any sense, in a basic hug, a basic handshake rubbing shoulders against each other. If you're both gay, you get, you get, and it starts from there and then that isolation progresses further and further to the point where the most natural thing, which is a reassuring hug or embrace when you meet someone you know becomes this almost taboo, unfamiliar territory. And it is such a shame that you even have to experience that because of the secondary socialisation, because your primary socialisation which is your family, you know about your dad came home and you gave him a big hug, like oh dad, and when you went and visited your grandparents, oh granddad, grand, and gave him a wee kiss and a wee hug and all that, and it all goes out the window because of secondary socialisation. Yet behind closed doors, behind closed doors, behind families perfectly normal, absolutely normal behaviour and it's very frustrating because to even think of how to tackle it where do you even start? Because the way it's set up is it's your fault on an individual level that you can't do these things that you can't hug your bro that you meet up with once a month and you can, it's your fault because you didn't keep up with that societal norm, you didn't break the moat you, like see how it's so hard to break from society's grasp at that point? Someone says how's the game going? I'm so sorry, I'm currently in a rant about the social education that you get after, I'm freaking going on a rant again I can't stop, I can't stop myself, it's fascinating stuff when you start to really break it down, it becomes almost frustrating when you realise how bare bones and simplistic humans are in nature and yet we are, pardon me, sorry, I'm burping away we are our own biggest enemies we live in a society, literally, I'm typing that too we live in a society that's it, I'm typing that in chat, that's me getting it out there we live in a society, get that out, get that off your chest you're welcome to type we live in a society as well in chat to get it off your chest because we do live in a society we live in a society, therapy stream when? oh I'm not sure I can do that, Mercy's actually doing a terrible therapy advice stream we live in a society wait, yes wait, yes, that, sorry, I just read that refling that was like your toes did everything for me, you're welcome after this stream tonight, with all the conspiracy talk, I need you to do conspiracy theory talking stream with Pippa, it would be incredible, love your yapping I just can't wait to get enough of the adorable cut of it, oh I don't know if I would go too far I've not had a chance to watch Pippa's content in a very long time but I don't know if I would go too far and I'm like I, my ideas are quite alienating, like as much as we were meming on needy streamer overload my I know you're not really supposed to talk about any of that, you're supposed to be a tee hee but yeah, I'm thinking you never know I plan on writing a fairly long fantasy of mine I've had of you, it's still cringe, I want to write it though as it was extremely pent up after you did it, is pace been fine for this yes, I recommend it oh no, strong is a moon truth, oh god what's that, I don't even know what that is I don't know if I'd go too far, she says when talking about the yabba it would be a race to see who will go too far, you're a Pippa I'm like, I'm probably 1984 dystopian type allegations, I don't know what Pippa's field is in particular but I am dystopian based, whatever horrors of man made comprehension you can think of, have occurred, you know, I'm like that kind of side of things, can you please say in the thickest Thailand accent I cast tongue positional awareness, sorry that was a really rough accent but there you go what's your favourite, Pringles favour paprika, I love Pappangles, Pippa is there and lizards are in government, literally 1984, Shawnee Calls Pippa is just psycho, she'll go way too far quicker well we shouldn't egg her on, how about we just leave this as moon truth or believes the moon is a hologram is a conspiracy theory made up to clown on that people actually started, well I have terrible news, I'm afraid I don't meet much of the requirements of a conspiracy theory, I'm afraid that yes, our planet is in fact very controversial, I know it's okay, it's okay, you can unsubscribe at least it's not Fahrenheit 451 yet right? yeah, Fahrenheit 451 yeah I guess if the reason why a lot of media before a certain year was kind of scrubbed on a mass level, so people realise people don't know that in every 100 years I try to get a sense of that true, Iron Reaver true right, imagine burning books you're a round airther unsubbed, I can't believe it the moon round, the sun round the earth on a turtle's back and world of warcraft that's all I'm saying the earth is round, oh wait isn't it not like a, there's like a certain name because it's like a wonky round and not a perfect round something like that have I shared any bibboots? I actually don't share them with the girls just because I don't know I just, it's never really occurred to me to do such a thing an oval lumpy ball, yeah a lumpy ball remember to check your balls regularly find a lump, get it checked out ladies and gentlemen and before you go, it's embarrassing I assure you the person who is doing the ultrasound on your boss act has already looked at about 10 sacks that day already and within that week has probably seen over 100 I assure you your wristicles raggy are not that unique get yourself checked out if you are worried an ultrasound, yeah that's what they do against your if you have a bump you get an ultrasound on your wristicle, raggy that's not the thing, isn't that an ultrasound? I checked I'm clear I mean we could check live if you want wow I zoomed through the backlog at 2x speed after hearing back where you read my marrow I found a lump and they have no idea what it is some things can be completely benign like you know we all come out a bit wonky can you come out 100% a perfect specimen now it's definitely thing had me balls all just sounded clear if you really want to, yeah right okay everyone follow my do your hands have calluses, rougher smooth feet question mark I have what's called hyper hydrosis especially in my feet and I do have it in my hands which means my hands are always very smooth I have no dryness because I am constantly wet really there's nothing else to go off by but yes I always have like kind of moist hands so they're always soft my feet are incredibly soft so yeah there you go now you know I was actually going to do a donathon reward where I give the like for a second and third place like thigh highs that I've worn but obviously with my sweaty feet constantly they're not like dripping not dripping I don't need Botox if you didn't know Botox will paralyze the sweat cells but they are constantly having like a they're not dry put it that way most guys hands are like dry so when you go like when you rub your hands together it's like but when I rub my hands well when I put my hands together I can fart with my hands because they're always clammy and wet and yeah that's very true I can always do that do it on command I can never find this most called flushed that most called flushed I can do that breathe it in lads and lasses well you are a cuttlefish I'd be concerned if you were tonight you're so talented sweaty hands aren't fun yes but it's a little bit annoying especially gaming with a controller because of the heat transfer it reflects straight back and my hands get very sweaty when I'm using a controller fart hands game when your hands are dry just hold Chinese I have enough sweat to make your hands nice and soft as well okay there's enough to go around I assure you don't read this out loud oh my god I'm getting intel I'm getting intel I know you said you wouldn't ever approach other v-tubers but considering the similarity of line of work would you ever consider a collab with project melody both of you seem very knowledgeable and passionate about positive A in education mental health I feel like you would be great for us I would never say no but at this point in time you know I'm just gonna focus on getting the girls like their achievement stuff I would never say no but like to reach out is quite you know daunting I'm sure anyone can kind of relate to that kind of thing yeah I would never say no a lot of people said that me and project melody seem to be like opposites and yet the same type thing with their kind of care and all that jazz reefing intelligent agency since you have hyper hydrolysis do you keep yourself well hydrated the way that I can tell I'm actually severely dehydrated as my hands go dry that's when I know I'm like up creek basically as if my hands stop my feet will never stop I have never been aware of my feet stopping sweating look at me I was always so embarrassing as well I don't know if you guys have school dance but I used to like rub my hands on my trousers like really quickly before like and I'm sure I bet you my dance partner like whoever you got on the day felt like I was doing it on purpose like oh boy and it's like no I have a really bad sweat problem I don't want anyone to know about it he he she's just like me for real for real your nerdy and yappy and intensively he he he I've never been to a school dance oh I guess maybe not every country does it but we had to learn like Scottish traditional dance like the gay garden did you say the gay garden yes gay isn't happy ha ha ha we get it we're called gay garden which means happy dance never been to a school dance can't relate I have hyperdologists too so I'm constantly dehydrated had school dance here in New Zealand it was similar hmm because I hate having to wipe my hands hi hey strongy question what sort of maros would you hate to receive I don't know I what would I hate to receive I don't know nothing really I don't know nothing really gets me like I can't even think of an example I don't know maybe like ask me to finish a game I didn't finish or something or be like you suck at this game oh oh my heart you've got me I can't believe it I can't believe I didn't finish every single game I've ever started oh you call me like I don't I don't know I can't think of an example me I think the force this is some sad dances at some point in primary middle I went to a school dance but there was not a specific dance I had to learn ah never went to a dance but always to the after party ooh ballin everyone quick tried to get under her skin why would you want under my skin you'd rather be I would say in it but hold on a minute that doesn't sound right well hold on a minute there you suck at Skyrim when you're gonna finish it oh oh you've got me oh tell me how bad I am at the RDA side oh oh you've got me I can't believe it right I should probably drink my tea and then we'll jump back into Skyrim that's right the tunes are on tunes are on mm okay I'm hydrating I'm hydrating mm-hmm mm-hmm she doesn't even know how to chase the RDA oh you've got me I didn't know to put the grenade launcher on oh who would have thought a grenade launcher I can't believe it I'm being I'm being dunked on ah I would probably say the thing that would genuinely upset me the most is if someone sent me something nasty about the daughters and obviously if that starts appearing in the inbox I know it's like not to pay heed but it's probably the worst thing I can imagine but I would then again it was like well you're subjecting me to not them so yeah that's what it is I like how she goes idle she hitting my eyes well it's actually for hunting but I think it can be used for a distraction as well before I ink on you I just ink on you and run away like what you're gonna do about it literally before you can even react I'm already gone eh do you ever play a follow game do you go for stats or stay list oh stats I absolutely cannot for the life of me by the pope no way miss Morgan that's hilarious that's hilarious congrats on getting back hopefully work went well

damn messy what of your latest armbion something about a khajiit merchant oh a big dog you say something I'm not kidding how adorable he's even in the workplace he wasn't a merchant he was a khajiit

it say oh consider adoption wanted a good home in these days of born strife the orphans of skyrim are the true victims many have no one left to turn to and face the life of hard labour poverty and misery if you could provide a stable home from one of these innocent children please consider adoption so adopt from us or take in someone closer to home you can make a difference in a child's life for more information inquire within Constance Michelle Honorary Hall Riften okay that is a very nice note she definitely is taking care of those children a bit more yes we are just going for a cheeky stab there should be someone in a tent over here um I don't know if we could I could have sworn you can speak to this person and they recognize you as someone from the dark brotherhood but they don't do anything about it I'm like 99% sure why are you here get away from me you are right to be paranoid oh oh shit I missed wait hold on okay maybe I thought he didn't run away but I guess he did right how do I get to I'll just take I'll just go westward from here time to adopt six children for gender oops let's not talk about gender oh no I love that actively I love that actively when you talk like when you do stuff in Skyrim like the NPCs kind of discuss it I think that's such a cool little detail I have to admit for a game for a game that came out in 2011 and was produced like before that that's pretty that's pretty decent you know are you gonna give it to them sometimes can't can't give them all the credit but you gotta give it to them sometimes unfortunately I believe we do we have to go south no we don't I'm just taking super long obnoxious way so I'm going to teleport back and then I'm basically just gonna go along the war's edge to get to this dawn star death is highly over here infamous last words so warhammer stuff literally oh you didn't see it coming just imagine how cool Skyrim 2 will be um did they even announce it yet or am I going crazy and they have jeez how do I get down oh I've not just done that have I that'll be fine that'll be fine on the old ankles right maybe this will do yeah easy easy just edge it a little bit nice and slow slowly slower good boy that's terrible I shouldn't do that you shouldn't ache me on either Elder Scrolls 6 is in development okay okay I could have sworn they hardly freaking talk about the damn thing I can't oh my god literally it's too easy the problem is you give me too much power and then I get high on it and I just do it all the time I'm not being funny that girl gave me far too much power with me seeing them freezes excuse you give me your soul not oh I'm out of soul gems wait where the heck am I going where the heck am I supposed to go straight ahead into the water why not get a horse it takes too long doesn't it and the horse aren't even that fast don't you beat me up I'll beat you up I'll smack you on your ball head it is um I don't mind giving you the power you're still going strong yes sorry I am I am going to redirect into mercy because unfortunately my achievements bugged out so it kind of may or may not have defeated the whole purpose of this achievement uh run uh man we keep running into Talos literally he was like that snake was like uh and then he was like yeah I don't care I can't I'm boss bossing on me what if we weiflings get the power anarchy very classic bro you're actually making me blush oh my god a girl me you like me can't comprehend it can't comprehend it doesn't make sense what do you mean the Scottish accent is not making you cringe at your boots what do you mean truly truly too much power Talos no see I'm literally I'm walking into Talos with north west so I can't even talk I'm getting flustered thinking there's a girl watching me with a fuck okay right I'm just going to converse this straight off the bat so I used to play Call of Duty and whenever there was like a girl on my team I used to get really flustered and I couldn't even talk properly I don't know why I just like completely clam up and I'm just like uh uh uh and I just get really like freaking terrible about it so it's really I don't know why I still haven't come over yet because I played a few rounds of valorant and it happened there was a girl on my team and I couldn't speak at all and voice chat and I don't know what it is and it's not even like I'm trying to like impress her or anything I just like get all weird and like I don't want to bother her you know I'm being weirdo I'm like it's not like I'm trying to like pick someone up or anything and I'm like freaking Call of Duty I don't know why I get all clammed up and it's happening it's literally happening right now in live stream and I'm like oh my god now everyone knows I'm a weirdo and I'm like uh I'm freaking talking to wham this hard better not better not speaking and starting to say bad jokes she's just like the majority of guys clamming up like basically every other cod player of honestly girls are steering wait until she really so the reason why it feels like it's different for valorant girls is because like I'm not trying to I'm not like trying to you know get anything out of them no that sounds really odd that makes it sound like I'm freaking honing in that sounds really odd hold on hold on let me think anything I can't imagine anything bad happening if we give one person all the power thank you for the don't know iron reaper again or the tip one of the other it's either the tip or the don't know either you give me the tip or the D it's up to you your choice call that a clam jam scrawny clamming up if speaking to women is hard then you sure are very talented at it well I'm like freaking my hands are sweating now and I'm getting my faces all red it's burning off I can feel it and I'm like oh my god I need to like right hold on can I even can I hurt you on your own balcony no question mark oh my god look at the way that was my business oh I got detected oh yeah I got detected get me up get me up get me up not detected there is a sanctum here by the way for the don star based off of yesterday's stream most of us can probably give you the tip honestly didn't you say that your hands are always sweating yes but I am I do have physical reactions to like stressors and it can make them sweat even more my left hand is currently soaked and my right hand I'm like touching my face hi hi sleigh saber you know girl too are you I can't take anymore I can't take anymore I'm losing it yes right what was I saying right cause the violour girls are like it doesn't I don't have any it's not like I'm trying to do anything I don't want to sound like I'm prederen I can't freaking say a sentence anyway this is Skyrim it's a really good game it came out in 20 actually came out on November the 11th 2011 which is release date was 11 11 11 11 which was really cool little tidbit if you didn't know I'm getting absolutely trolled right now anyway hi what do you want nothing I don't want anything wait oh I got bounty added to me that's not good that means the guards are always going to come up to me unless I clear the bounty could you imagine you could start short well that's why the plastic on like the controller in that is really good for that issue I got seen I fear for the girl refuelling oh I see I didn't know you were there oh my gosh I see that was terrifying weee this is the riskiest thing I've ever done do not go down a waterfall whatever you do by the way that's a terrible choice right can I teleport back to Mazeem I can are you still playing on legendary yes I am I never was not playing legendary at any point I can show you again if you want look a little to the left okay it's really cute that you're getting flustered over this when every time you speak makes me flustered what was I saying thank you for the tip Miss Morgan I appreciate it what was I showing oh yeah I'm on legendary look a little to the left see look see legendary I've been on it the entire time I don't know why anyone thinks I'm not on legendary for some reason the proof is right on screen right now so it's rather odd yeah see fair enough yeah oh wait hold on oh look a little to the right again where am I oh I'm still running away from the guards the guards aren't chasing me they can be I'm in the middle of a waterfall the guards are chasing me oh there's an in route let's go get the in route thank you for the tip again Miss Morgan I never doubt scrawny what you mean me they have made legendary for scrawny specifically because the game was too easy true true Andrea am I being can I just teleport to my location so I can progress with my campaign what is shooting bone arrows at me is that Lydia is Lydia turned against me too get me down the stream I'm a fish I'm actually a fish get me this is literally what it looks like from the outside POV you're just zooming down the rocks can we teleport now yes we can she's just so good guys honestly well I was going nope not at all definitely a MLG gamer and she tells you her problems because I'm so good literally I don't know why people seem to struggle playing on legendary oh Cicero are you squidding me right now listen scrawny our Scots accent if one of few benefits of being Scottish so use it to your advantage as much as you can thank you for the tip Kitsune use my Scottish accent to my advantage even the night mother are of course welcome here Cicero and you will be afforded the respect deserving of your position as keeper understood I think I may or may not be rather submissive at the moment so I can't take a much to say oh pardon me putting out my weapon in the middle of a cutscene I'll be clear on that point oh yes mistress perfectly you're the boss oh there you are I was done speaking with that muttering fool anyway we've got business to discuss do you have a contract for me is this over for mash and speak with the apothecaries assistant you'll probably find her in the hags cure when the shoppers why does Cicero sound like junk oh why would you say something like that my name is Moeery rip tie is ready to roll I'll let you keep whatever Moeery pays ah there you are I was done speaking with that muttering fool hello hello it's good to meet you Cicero just keep your distance Jester and we'll get along just fine it's good to meet you so polite so nice Cicero likes you the night mother is sure to like you too oh we're going to be fast friends why did you come to the sanctuary Cicero the night mother's crypt in Bravil was desecrated my stripe nowhere there is safe at present so Cicero brought our lady to her home this is the only sanctuary left in all of Skye River you see such was my honour as keeper as keeper how much did they spend on this freaking voice actor who's he nailed it what are your duties of a keeper look at yourself Cicero not about the night mother or feeling submissive you're such a good girl thank you oh Cicero was just the keeper I look at love me are you squidding me right now would you like me more if I transitioned to a woman have you got a pole I want the pole if you've got a hole I want the hole don't swap you don't need a swap the words the listener what's a listener Cicero the listener is the only person the night mother speaks to Stroney's an equal opportunist are you squidding me right now you dislike Cicero oh you don't like his character but inside the listener's head I hear da but there has not been a listener in years and years a lady has not chosen I like to dislike Cicero but Cicero's like trying to stroney's such a good right you're done collectively you're done I was supposed to hand in the contract so I wasn't paying attention thank you for the tip anonymous but no you got a pole keep the pole don't be swapping stuff around there's a whole other conversation that can come out of that but we can't even get into that we're going to very slowly hand over all the freaking things I love watching your long gaming sessions that was lovely to be backdrop thank you for the tip I appreciate that I'm glad I was worthy to wait for after all this time it had been a while I have to make up for lost time why do you want to eat me I don't even thought about that oh yeah I want to eat calamari no you're not supposed to want to eat it thank you for the tip pick one I like how Lydia just respectfully hangs out she's like yeah I'm not going to come in and solve my problem thank you I appreciate it there was a lot of I don't know what the word is I suppose emotional turmoil is a bit of a dramatic lower yeah I'm fine he was shouting about the foreign swore I think you dropped this do you know anything hello the dark brother has come we're here I'd prefer it raw like sushi we're not supposed to want to eat it I'm glad because there was like the emotional turmoil and a lot of bad memories came back to the surface but they got completely manually overrated just because of the love and everything that we did the girls and I couldn't have predicted anything at all it was impossible to predict and we were dealing with a major calling at the time which was really messing with like how to predict anything at all okay but what were we supposed to do with the fish I can give explicit detail would you like explicit detail we love you love you little replay please do someone says lick it take the dirt take the dirt nice and easy wait is there someone here I need to perish wait did I read the map wrong I think I might have read the map wrong you hear about the story of a dude who put a fish in his pants no I did not is this bad am I supposed to perish her she's so messed up are you okay wait so why does why does she have to be cherished if it's optional I'm not actually going to do it because that's really mean I have a perfect mean for the situation cherish the fish worship the fish for all mortal positions no that is nothing why are you shooting you've just attacked those bandits no wonder they're shooting a little to the right but I can forfeit the fish best I can forfeit to fish no keep it no give money to fish unless is there even an unless I don't even think there's really an unless in that scenario it's not that one no it's up here I'm not really sure if I'm going to be able to make it to this checkpoint because I'm definitely not supposed to be coming up the sheer cliff face of a mountain only give money if you can afford it but even then I feel like there's so many attachments to it and it's like only give it if you're financially stable only give it if you are genuinely enjoying the content only give it if you know you've treated yourself and you've got savings and all that and you're looking after yourself like if you're in debt or anything like that no it's a big no no like you don't need to be donating to myself and I'm sure the VLRR girls all agree with me like make sure you're sorted out first make sure you're secure first like

get to hear other perspectives you are very slowly filling up that bar and one a very big life lesson can be hold on hold on I'm wrecking and decking right now even I have to admit that's pretty impressive oh right okay well you weren't really I thought okay that was really bizarre is this book yes do you also get XP but you also get XP for hurting people what just wait until you find the one butthole who's just enough XP to level up oh no seriously I don't mean talking about I can teach you guys about debt and how it works and how credit cards work I genuinely believe credit cards are the absolute spawn of Satan for lack of better words I absolutely they're terrible and once you get sucked into them and you're uneducated in them it's like obviously not part of your curriculum surprise surprise I wonder why oh that's right we're going down the conspiracy theory holding man like gee willikers I wonder why you're not told about how to do your taxes properly I wonder how you're not told to financially gee it's almost like the world runs if people are on debt because of the way society is set up because we love capitalism which is why I absolutely do not want any like tips or

wishy-dice but why oh my god no true Seaf Guild master thank you for the stream you're more than welcome thank you for hanging and I will redirect into mercy oh can you do a collab with the girls where you do a round of terrible advice that would actually be quite funny I wouldn't mind doing that my collab is actually power washer sim where you get to see us all together because someone not naming names, refling guessed the entire reason why we're playing power washer first out of all the games of course you had to figure out what the freaking plot was but yes I will see you giffy givers tomorrow brushing your teeth oh I don't have my toothbrush here I might like to do it tomorrow I'll still work Matty's but we'll do it on stream tomorrow like after the the foot part but thank you so much for having me thank you for letting me do another well it wasn't a fool endurance but it was almost a fool endurance it wasn't too bad tomorrow is getting bulldozed for monetization celebration so be there or be a square I won't be up for too long definitely not an endurance stream but please don't worry if you can't make it the void will remain up I will be a good girl just like you you'll be a good boy won't you or a good girl yeah only nine over a stream yeah just a little bit but yes we will be good together and we don't need to worry it should remain up and I think that's everything I have to say it's possible do we have to stagger our monetization celebration days or can I if I did two if I did two hours and then perfectly read into she be yeah that's fine if she decides to do hers as well because I'm not going to tell her not to do it you know I'm not going to say no six hours shaking my head I'm such a fake gamer I'm such a rubbish streamer nine hours she said again okay I have to learn that being called a good boys okay I've learned that being called a good boys move well it's supposed to make you weak in the knees for me it's simple okay you behave you get rewarded fair and simple exchange oh you do have to go to 599 to avoid gifting you're joking please tell me you're trolling me and it's not 599 is it actually 599 I don't think I can charge that much that's not fair mmm mmm why did gifting change does gifting not go to the lowest here are we sure gifting doesn't do the lowest here what's gifting so when someone is monetized you can gift membership to other people and um I specifically am having you know what we could test it on me we could test it on me tomorrow I know how to um dance the line okay we'll test it on me tomorrow we'll see what happens strongy street spot oh English strongy speaks and my heart becomes weak 100% sure it doesn't seen tons of channels with 199 split let me let me cook and I'll put the price that I want and I think it's fair and we'll see what happens and if it's just an absolute cluster minuster then we'll deal with a fallout on me at least and then the girls are unaffected by any fallout the fear of a thingy but I've never seen it happen nah and it's like I have to turn on being able to be gifted yes I would put it on because it's a big income source and I have terrible news I spent a lot of money yeah failure wasn't cheap let's put it that way yes not even fallout in new vegas what about fallout in new vegas I've seen 399 and 799 that's rubbish if they use it they have to turn on being able to receive gifts ok ok well that's a team effort just a wee bit of money just a wee bit of pocket money if so well I will let you be carried away to mercy gently well she gives you terrible advice and we'll take it from tomorrow and see if we are able to make everything run smoothly and if not thank you for the stream bye amy I modded like all of yumiya on my channel oh yumiya your mod problem now
