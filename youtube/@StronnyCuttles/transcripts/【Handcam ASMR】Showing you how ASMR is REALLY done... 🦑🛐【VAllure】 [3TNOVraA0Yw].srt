1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
All right.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
I think that's it.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Oh, I want to try.

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
I think I can do it.

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
I will try.

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
I think I can do it.

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
No.

8
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
I think I can do it.

9
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
I think I can do it.

10
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
All right.

11
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Okay.

12
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Let me try.

13
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
God, I'm fucking so nervous.

14
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Can I have you?

15
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
You have to stay away.

16
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I think it's working.

17
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Okay.

18
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
It's working.

19
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Hi.

20
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Hi.

21
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Can you hear me?

22
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Can you hear me?

23
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Welcome.

24
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Welcome to my life.

25
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I think I can do it.

26
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I want to.

27
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I have my world going on.

28
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I want to.

29
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
To show you.

30
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
At least now that you're done.

31
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I know I do.

32
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I love you too.

33
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
So.

34
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
I wish that.

35
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
The ears might be the wrong way.

36
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
This is a very high possibility.

37
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Just because it's quiet.

38
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Oh, no.

39
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Why?

40
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
It's not better.

41
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Does it feel too quiet?

42
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Oh, no.

43
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Much better.

44
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Did you get your nails on the color of your yukata?

45
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
No.

46
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Oh, shit.

47
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Okay.

48
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Okay.

49
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Where did you get this key?

50
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Do you mean this one right here?

51
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Or this one?

52
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
It's still too low?

53
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Hold on.

54
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Hold on.

55
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Okay.

56
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Okay.

57
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Okay.

58
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I don't know.

59
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
How is that?

60
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
I have a link in the description.

61
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Everyone's doing my job.

62
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Okay.

63
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
This is my cello.

64
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
You like it?

65
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
I don't know.

66
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
So.

67
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
If you can hear my cat going ape shit,

68
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
it's because I gave Gimli a new toy with a bail on it.

69
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
So if you hear a bail in the background,

70
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
that's Gimli.

71
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Nice and airy.

72
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
You like it?

73
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,000
It's currently your own box.

74
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,000
With a nice soft blanket on top.

75
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000
And it's like a little

76
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
tingling platform.

77
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
I can put my nails all over it.

78
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Are we in the box?

79
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
No, you're on a box.

80
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
And have like other sort in the tool.

81
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Got my latex gloves.

82
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Got a brush.

83
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Got a little wooden stick.

84
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
I've got everything to tingle with.

85
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
And you just have a thing.

86
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Looks like a...

87
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Here we touch this thing.

88
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
What's in the box?

89
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Yeah.

90
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
This is just a nice cosy string game

91
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
showing you

92
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
some more stuff.

93
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
This is a microphone.

94
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Leave it more Gimli in the background.

95
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
This microphone

96
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
is $500.

97
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
So you

98
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
is

99
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
dollars.

100
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Did you hear Gimli there?

101
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
She's got absolutely

102
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
nuts right now.

103
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
She woke me up

104
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
to

105
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
have to give her a toy.

106
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Yes, this maker is $500.

107
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
And the other microphone

108
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
I use is $2,000.

109
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
And then the microphone

110
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
I'm getting on my birthday, my one year

111
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
anniversary for Strony

112
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
is $10,000.

113
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Oh actually, I think it's like

114
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
$12,000 US dollars.

115
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
So that'll be an interesting purchase.

116
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
But

117
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
as my reward for

118
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
streaming every day for a year

119
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
I'm gonna buy

120
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
the K100 for myself.

121
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
And then we're gonna have

122
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
lots of fun ASMR.

123
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Because apparently if I like

124
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
touch over the head

125
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
or hear me touch over

126
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
and I wanna do a video

127
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
putting my feet on the face of the microphone

128
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
just over and over again

129
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
and touch

130
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
my feet.

131
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
So my feet are gonna be like this

132
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
all over the head

133
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
of the microphone.

134
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Your feet are cooking.

135
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
There's some balls in my

136
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Okay, it'll be for

137
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
first order of business

138
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
is to drink my

139
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
motherfucking turn.

140
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
And gripper.

141
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Some people like glass

142
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
touching ASMR.

143
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Just generally

144
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
stripping over the ear.

145
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
I always say

146
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
it can be really cheap if you want it to be.

147
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
It doesn't have to be. These are makeup brushes.

148
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
I'm so confused as to

149
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
your feet and your head. I'm so sorry.

150
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Knees to the side. I'm

151
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
crisscross applesauce. These are my knee.

152
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
This is my knee.

153
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
It would be better if I like

154
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
hug the box with my legs.

155
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Would that make more sense?

156
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
I'm not.

157
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
This is my ASMR sale.

158
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Does that make sense?

159
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
It's Frodo back and still here.

160
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
He absolutely is. Would you like to see Bilbo?

161
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Are you ready?

162
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Hold on.

163
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
I have to very carefully do this.

164
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
I'm not tilting it.

165
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
I have Lego.

166
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
And look, there's Gandalf.

167
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
So Gandalf is full size.

168
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Turns out the hobbits are wee.

169
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Okay, I got my Lego left of the room.

170
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
We can pretend to do ASMR on it.

171
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
I need to be very careful

172
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
if it looses.

173
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
You can fall apart very quickly.

174
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
There's actually one ASMR tingle

175
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
that I don't do a lot

176
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
and I really, really like it.

177
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
It's not glass touching.

178
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
I wouldn't put these to the side.

179
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
So this is called ear cupping.

180
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Okay.

181
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
This is ear tapping.

182
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Okay.

183
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
This is ear, like,

184
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
I don't know, swirling.

185
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Okay.

186
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Like, I don't know, swirling,

187
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
if you want.

188
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
You know what tingle I like?

189
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
I call it ear squishing

190
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
and I go like this.

191
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
So I do with this umbrella.

192
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Thank you for the man-bush.

193
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
That's the little

194
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
baby clicker.

195
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
I think these smart doesn't have to be expensive.

196
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
This is literally just a razor holder.

197
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
They're like, holding it.

198
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
And it's just the gentle click noise.

199
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
I think it's nice.

200
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
The ear sound has switched up.

201
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
I don't know how to change that.

202
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
It's the wrong side.

203
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Hold on.

204
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
I might be able to figure out how to change that.

205
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Give me one moment.

206
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
I think I can do it now.

207
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Hello.

208
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Please ignore the earthquake

209
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
that just ensued.

210
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Is it the correct side?

211
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
No.

212
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
The sound was coming from the right ear.

213
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Did you just make me change that

214
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
for no reason?

215
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
No, it's the good side.

216
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Perfect.

217
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
No, it's facing

218
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
as reverse.

219
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
What? Wait, let's say this is the first video.

220
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
You're trolling me.

221
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
I'm being trolled.

222
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Give me a moment.

223
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Give me a second.

224
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
You can watch me.

225
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Make the ear the model.

226
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Chat is confused by the left and right.

227
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Chat and me mix the stream way.

228
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Your other way.

229
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Oops.

230
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Can you give it away early?

231
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
You want one?

232
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
It's covered in spit.

233
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Did it work?

234
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
No.

235
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
You don't like it?

236
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
You don't like it?

237
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Can I lick a finger?

238
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
No.

239
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
That's me.

240
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
So...

241
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
I like those ears.

242
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
You want your ASMR really?

243
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
This is...

244
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
This is just your regular run of the mill

245
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
corp

246
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
C-O-R-K

247
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
corp

248
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
But if you have fake nails

249
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
these nails are called SMS

250
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
and actually they produce

251
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
such a nice

252
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
deep

253
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
sand

254
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
nice deep sand

255
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
like that

256
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
which I think is really

257
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
What happened to your real nails?

258
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
They're now hidden under the

259
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Do you have a breath somewhere?

260
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
I don't know what that is.

261
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Thank you basically

262
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
but this

263
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
deep sand

264
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
is similar

265
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
to white noise

266
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
in my opinion

267
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
I don't know if I could

268
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
put it on your ear maybe

269
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
just pat very gently

270
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
a cup holder

271
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
I'm a very big fan of this

272
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
I'm going to be making a lot of ASMRs

273
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
with this in the future

274
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
because I thoroughly, thoroughly enjoy it

275
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
I'm going to record more of this as well

276
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
It really gives you a swirly

277
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Isn't it acoustic?

278
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Yeah. Why is my PC so far?

279
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
I don't know

280
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
I'm big over

281
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Thank you for the extended membership

282
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Hello

283
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
I also got

284
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
like a little fidget toy

285
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
We're going to

286
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
find that she's clicker training

287
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
We're going to find out what it does together

288
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
This is an analog stick

289
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Like that

290
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Last video, thanks for the extended membership

291
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
It's like this little

292
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
side-by-side clicker that doesn't click

293
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
It doesn't click

294
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
It doesn't have drift on it

295
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
This one's just a circular

296
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
little circle

297
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Thank you Blackwatch

298
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
for the extended membership

299
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Then this one

300
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
is like buttons

301
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
I can't do it because of my nails

302
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
I can't do it

303
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
It's so hard

304
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
This is like a wee ball thing

305
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
I don't really know what that looks like

306
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
I'm not very satisfied

307
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Then that's just the bottom

308
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Playing with an analog stick

309
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
a little

310
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
left-right-left-right

311
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
It's a PS6 controller

312
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Can you imagine you made a controller that small

313
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
and you were like

314
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Rendered thing

315
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Thank you for the extended membership

316
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
That was like a fidget toy

317
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
It's not really for me

318
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
It's a baby kick

319
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
This is glass ASMR

320
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
I did it a little bit earlier

321
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
The problem

322
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
with glass ASMR

323
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
is that it's bloody

324
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
creating ASMR sound

325
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
Thank you so much for the extended membership

326
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
When you record it live

327
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
you can edit

328
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
if it gets too loud

329
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Whereas if I'm quiet

330
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
and I tap a bit loud

331
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
I can edit it out close production

332
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Can't whisper

333
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Thank you for the extended membership

334
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
I am starring as a poacher

335
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
and the feet is just eating moist sound

336
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
Just jump

337
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Can do it fast

338
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
See if you do it fast

339
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
That doesn't sound as nice

340
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
If I just very quickly go

341
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
That's not an axe

342
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
You can just take your time

343
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
It's not a ray

344
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
It's just nice

345
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
You can even see

346
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
the bulb is passing on

347
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
and then just reset them

348
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
by putting them back up

349
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Is this supposed to be a tutorial?

350
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
I guess it's just to show you how the tangles are done

351
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
because if you don't watch

352
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
in real life ASMR creators

353
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
you only just

354
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
hear

355
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
you don't see how it's done

356
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
real close to your ear

357
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
or you can do it one more time

358
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
Now

359
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
this one is very hard to do

360
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
live

361
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
and I don't like doing it through live

362
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
because

363
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
the wood sounds nice when it clacks together

364
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
a lot of them

365
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Oh, Chunky Boots

366
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
I was supposed to be working on this tangles

367
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
but your voice is so good

368
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
even when you're billion

369
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
if I was billion year

370
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
I'd be sitting on you

371
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
I don't think I won't sit on you

372
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
I'll do it

373
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
I'll do it right now

374
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
The wooden sticks

375
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
they sound good

376
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
pre-recorded and edited

377
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
and loaded

378
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
but sometimes

379
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
when they work together

380
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
you can make an unpleasant sound

381
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
which I'm not the biggest fan of

382
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
I can edit it

383
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
please do it

384
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
fabled fun

385
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
can't you do feet count notes

386
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
already did my feet, did you miss them

387
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
feet cupping ASMR

388
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
when other VTubers

389
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
do not provide

390
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
remember me

391
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
remember me

392
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
when you have to beg

393
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
and plead for a hint of anything

394
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
from another VTuber

395
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
remember me

396
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
you get what you want when you want

397
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
you get the delivered fresh halt

398
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
right off the oven

399
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
I'm gonna drink my tea

400
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
give me one more

401
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
that's how much I drank

402
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
I don't have anything I can give you

403
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
but I'll just beg

404
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
fresh, hot and fresh

405
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
when others make you

406
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
give you a doughnut on Milestone

407
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
I've already done it

408
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
I've been there, done it

409
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
get out of here

410
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
you're not a good boy

411
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
I'll need to hold up the microphone

412
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
one second

413
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
be ready

414
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
you've been sucked

415
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
a good boy

416
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
you've been sucked

417
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
a good boy

418
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
there you go

419
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
where are these

420
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
do you see me now

421
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
come back up

422
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
why are you so moved up

423
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
can you tell me what I'm about

424
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
hey gen mates

425
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
why are you so far up

426
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
microphone needs to be in the center of attention

427
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
shriveling

428
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
shriveling

429
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
these are very good for

430
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
here

431
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
if you ever want to do realistic here

432
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
don't know if you can see that

433
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
they look much better

434
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
these are really good just for

435
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
a casual but faster tapping

436
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
so you know if you tap

437
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
I get some more fast

438
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
like you can tell that's fast

439
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
that's more energetic

440
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
you might wake you up a bit

441
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
but if you take something like this

442
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
although the noise is quite constant

443
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
and fast and general

444
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:46,000
this kind of sounds much more controlled

445
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
or do you want much more

446
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
if you want to be lazy

447
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
you could just brush it

448
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
at random intervals

449
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
the good thing

450
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
about anything plastic

451
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
is when you have these fake nails

452
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
the plastic

453
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
always sounds so good

454
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
I think of a plastic

455
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
on fake nails

456
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
like this

457
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
if you really want to tease

458
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
just one tap at a time

459
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
so you have to wait for the time

460
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
you have to be good

461
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
you know how to be patient don't you

462
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
yeah

463
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
speaking of being patient

464
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
let me try my teeth

465
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
your very beautiful hands

466
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
yeah I think they look quite cute

467
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
wrapped around things you know

468
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
wrapped around this comb

469
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
wrapped around

470
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
ice gloves

471
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
I think they just look really nice

472
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
wrapped around something

473
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
a brush

474
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
I'll rub one ear while I drink it

475
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
okay

476
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
halfway done

477
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
almost done

478
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
safe look I'm drinking

479
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
let me see those thighs

480
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
I'm making a cane to see them

481
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
I think it's like tea by the box

482
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
that's as best as I could do

483
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
why does your tea look like coffee

484
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
I didn't actually put a lot of milk in it today

485
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
so I'm glad you know

486
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
all the fingernails mommy can't wait

487
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
till they lose their marks

488
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
could you imagine that

489
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
thank you for the word

490
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
I mean I could

491
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
maybe you can imagine

492
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
while I do it to the box

493
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
through the nail marks

494
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
I'm gonna brush them away

495
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
I'm gonna brush them away

496
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
I can brush them away

497
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
I'm gonna grab one again

498
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
almost done

499
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
okay and one more for good measure

500
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
cause we're such a good player

501
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
if it ain't hard and it ain't work

502
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
do you want to actually lay back

503
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
you're a real black girl

504
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
I'm gonna give you back scratches

505
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
nice back scratch

506
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
are you reading the elements at the end

507
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
yes I will read at the end

508
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,000
I'll try to keep up

509
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
but I'm crying

510
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
scratch marks looks like they hurt too much

511
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
are you sure you wouldn't let me

512
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
with my nails

513
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
well just cause they're pointy

514
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
come on

515
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
let me do it pretty

516
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
promise I'll make it

517
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
only cause you asked the knife for

518
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
yeah the pointy

519
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
I get a nail shoot

520
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
that's called

521
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
stilettos

522
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
which is the pointiest nail shoot

523
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
you can get

524
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
okay time to put you in the coffin

525
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
are you ready

526
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
these are just earmuffs

527
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
and yes they look a bit silly

528
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
and that's it

529
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
yeah

530
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
scratch your nail over my body

531
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
don't make fun

532
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,000
this is just literally regular earmuffs

533
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
I can do one at a time

534
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
so

535
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
put them on

536
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
earmuffs

537
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
very fluffy

538
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
and then on a wheelchair

539
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
you'll be able to see them

540
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
I can run my fingers

541
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
along the head and

542
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
and you'll hear

543
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
way stronger than I do

544
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
like a real stone

545
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
maybe especially from the inside

546
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
but because

547
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
both of the

548
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
earmuffs are on you

549
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
you can

550
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
when I can visualize it

551
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
you can also take my nail

552
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
and just

553
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
use your tongue

554
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
and you might think

555
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
that one ear

556
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
has more

557
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
fingers than the other

558
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
and that's perfectly normal

559
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
it is very natural to have one ear that is

560
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
stronger

561
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
than the other

562
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
you'll always be teaching

563
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
to look so cute

564
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
I say stop hating

565
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
I say stop hating

566
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
I say go up there

567
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
they're actually

568
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
not to be an ace

569
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
thematus but they're actually really good

570
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
material to tap on

571
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
like

572
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
I know you can hear that

573
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,000
they're so good to tap on

574
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
for ages and more purposes

575
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
that was the earmuffs

576
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
oh I didn't do much

577
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
of this

578
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,000
so you can

579
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
to

580
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
hear

581
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
show you how much you can

582
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
I'm so sorry I might trample over

583
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
A.C. right now

584
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
I'm so sorry

585
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
forgive me

586
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
okay

587
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
I'm getting out

588
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
put it in

589
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
give me a me

590
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
give me mercy

591
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
give me an ace

592
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
give me a sir

593
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
there we go

594
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
tapping the family

595
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
gone right

596
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,000
so this just wouldn't

597
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,000
notice I

598
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
like to edit and post

599
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
because they are a bit

600
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
loaded and I don't understand that

601
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
but

602
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
depending

603
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
if I can have a steady hand

604
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
or if you don't have a steady hand

605
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
you might think don't use more

606
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
a bit more difficult images

607
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
because you need to be a bit

608
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
like not to be dramatic

609
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
but you need to be

610
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
a little bit precise

611
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
and what's going on

612
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
I mean I can really show you

613
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
this is what I'm doing

614
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
getting closer to your ear

615
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
if it works with anything

616
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
I try to go

617
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,000
around

618
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
so that little bit inside

619
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
that's the microphone

620
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
do not touch this

621
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
but they're going around

622
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
like this

623
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000
so an ex-alcoholic

624
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
doesn't got a chance right

625
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
I mean I don't get it

626
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,000
but

627
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
I never like

628
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
put anything to this part

629
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000
that's too much for the microphone

630
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
where's my one

631
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
how to

632
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
this is a perfect example

633
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
this is like the only tool

634
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
that I like close to that microphone

635
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
because if I twirl

636
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
I might look pretty

637
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
nice

638
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,000
I think it's quite nice

639
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
I'll just show it

640
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,000
I'm just gently twirling

641
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,000
you can hear the difference

642
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
when I go around

643
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
the earlobe area

644
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,000
that's going like around it

645
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,000
and then

646
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
as I get closer

647
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,000
to the inner part

648
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
I would definitely slow down

649
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
and just twirl

650
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
gently

651
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
there's no rush

652
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
there's no range

653
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
but this is just

654
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,000
they're called Japanese ear cleaning tool

655
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
they were

656
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
the best ever tingle purchase

657
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
I would argue

658
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,000
I'd say this was first place

659
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
for ASMR items

660
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,000
that I bought

661
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,000
these second place

662
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,000
the earlobes I never realized

663
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,000
how bloody good they would sound

664
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
and they just sound so terrible

665
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
I absolutely adore them

666
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,000
like I really do

667
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
and for other types of

668
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000
ASMR tingles

669
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000
let me just

670
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
get you ready for your exam

671
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
sir

672
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
I'll do both then

673
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
now

674
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
latex

675
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,000
adds another layer

676
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,000
an ironic layer

677
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,000
to the tingle

678
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
if you use latex

679
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,000
so

680
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
you know what your cupping sounds like

681
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
but this is what it sounds like

682
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:52,000
they add an almost crinkly layer

683
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,000
just something extra to the tingle

684
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,000
which is quite nice

685
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,000
but having another

686
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
latex thing

687
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,000
we'll see how it's going to sound

688
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,000
a little crunchier

689
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,000
like if I tried to tap

690
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
see how it's more subdued

691
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
it's deeper

692
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
I think it's good for me

693
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,000
can I

694
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
that's good

695
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000
she we're the best to tap on right now

696
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,000
so like even though

697
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,000
like if we

698
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,000
want to do finger fluttering as well

699
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,000
it doesn't mean

700
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
well it doesn't mean

701
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,000
we're not that kind of agency

702
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,000
oh too much must wear gloves

703
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
shut up

704
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,000
but because you can hear the sound

705
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,000
of the latex moving

706
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,000
all stadoos

707
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,000
all these

708
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
tingles

709
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
there's something

710
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,000
I feel like I'm going to sleep

711
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,000
but I need to learn something

712
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,000
honestly the best info

713
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,000
I can give is

714
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,000
does it sound good to you?

715
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,000
yes or no

716
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,000
and if the answer is no

717
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,000
I don't know

718
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
literally

719
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,000
there's so many tingles that people like

720
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
that the majority like

721
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000
and I'm like I don't even like that

722
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
I don't know

723
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,000
and you can always do

724
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,000
what's called

725
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,000
a distraction tingle

726
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,000
so like

727
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,000
so you see how like you would focus on my hand

728
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,000
right now because I'm

729
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,000
oh shit

730
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
well sorry

731
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,000
there goes the relaxing atmosphere

732
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,000
sorry

733
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,000
I can do what's called a distraction tingle

734
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,000
which is like put it in front of you

735
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,000
but then secretly

736
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
I'll have this like

737
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,000
just ready to go

738
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,000
so you focus on that

739
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,000
and then I go into just any sound

740
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,000
sure was distracting

741
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,000
well it fucking got you didn't it

742
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
or you can do some visual stuff as well

743
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,000
like I don't normally

744
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,000
obviously it's not necessary for like

745
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,000
what I do

746
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
because I do

747
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,000
but like you can do visual stuff

748
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
that's a bit silly

749
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
silly

750
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
hold on

751
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,000
oh that was really

752
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,000
anti-colonistic

753
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,000
I thought I was gonna go like bloop bloop bloop

754
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,000
no

755
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,000
okay it's not doing it

756
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,000
well I guess we could do it like right against

757
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,000
the ear visually

758
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,000
oh

759
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,000
hi hi

760
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
you're yapping you could do it

761
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,000
it's probably the funniest part

762
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,000
of doing ASMR

763
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,000
see how it doesn't

764
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,000
change how the depth

765
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,000
of the corks

766
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,000
so when you do role plays

767
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,000
for example

768
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,000
you want to be as realistic as possible with a role play

769
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
now realistic

770
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,000
and quotation marks

771
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,000
if I were to do a clinic role play

772
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,000
I'm not going to actually

773
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,000
get you to sit and do my exam

774
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,000
because I do audio on my base

775
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,000
ASMR

776
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,000
so doing things

777
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,000
as simple as okay

778
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,000
give me a moment, I'll put on the gloves

779
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,000
and then you hear the gloves when you put on

780
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,000
the ear

781
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
you can hear me use the ear cleaning tool

782
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,000
but when I read

783
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
the tool

784
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,000
you can hear the latex

785
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,000
and then I'll say something

786
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,000
along the lines of

787
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,000
oh just hold your head still

788
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,000
I'm just gonna hold you still here right then

789
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,000
so then you're still engaged

790
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,000
this ear for tingles

791
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,000
and you can almost hear that cupping effect

792
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,000
so you should be able to hear it

793
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
but so just hold still

794
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,000
for me

795
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,000
and

796
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,000
for the ear kind of thing

797
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,000
and you can hear the latex

798
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,000
you can hear the brush

799
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,000
and you can hear that kind of facility role play

800
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,000
and

801
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,000
I think it works out quite well

802
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,000
and it's like oh well

803
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,000
unfortunately I don't think I've

804
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,000
you know done what I've started to do

805
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,000
but this would still look a little bit

806
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,000
way for me

807
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,000
and then that's when you can introduce

808
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,000
your new tingle

809
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,000
now it's not

810
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,000
impossible to write the pop

811
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,000
okay

812
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,000
it's not impossible

813
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,000
can you try heart rate sound

814
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,000
it'd be a very

815
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,000
inappropriate doctor's visit

816
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,000
but sure I'll give you my heart rate in a minute

817
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,000
um

818
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,000
what makes

819
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,000
a role play really nice for me

820
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,000
personally is someone who writes them

821
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,000
is when it makes

822
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,000
sense

823
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,000
like you come in with a sore ear

824
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,000
I'm gonna clean out your ears

825
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,000
I'm gonna use all these different assumptions

826
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,000
I'm gonna do a basic sound test

827
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,000
at the end

828
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,000
like I like that

829
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,000
it's hard

830
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,000
sometimes especially if you do role play

831
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,000
after role play after role play

832
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,000
to try

833
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,000
a cohesive story

834
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,000
because some of the stories is like

835
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
just nonsense

836
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,000
like I have a

837
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000
new patch, new patch where I've been beaten up

838
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000
coming out for 15,000

839
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,000
subscriber milestone

840
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,000
and it just looks

841
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,000
like I'm doing a very very done

842
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,000
I'm trying

843
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,000
can you hear this

844
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,000
it's a fine tone as well

845
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,000
and

846
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,000
I do love it

847
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,000
with all the lore premise

848
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,000
that's why I'm not

849
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,000
enjoying that too

850
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,000
but it does get rather difficult

851
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,000
because you know there's only so many times

852
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,000
you can visit your cleaning clinic

853
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,000
well no that's a lie

854
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,000
you could just

855
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,000
you've got the new pair

856
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,000
shut up

857
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,000
let's take these off

858
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,000
give me a little teens right now

859
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,000
and whisper hate behind

860
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,000
it's my

861
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,000
hand

862
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,000
oh my gosh

863
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,000
I like that

864
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,000
you like watching me take it off

865
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,000
yes

866
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,000
can't take it off

867
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,000
oh hand review

868
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,000
oh

869
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,000
oh

870
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,000
yeah baby

871
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,000
tell

872
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,000
me

873
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,000
it's kind of my

874
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,000
my true sense

875
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,000
you can do it

876
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,000
what you want

877
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,000
it's not

878
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,000
a big issue

879
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,000
and you can always

880
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,000
combine tingles as well

881
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,000
I'm definitely

882
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,000
of the sort where I have to like

883
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,000
tingle over and over again

884
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,000
pretty names

885
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,000
yeah you like the color scheme too

886
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,000
I wonder if you like it

887
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,000
after I'm pregnant

888
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,000
why are only

889
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,000
the middle finger and thumb

890
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,000
that color

891
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,000
I don't know

892
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,000
I wonder what it means

893
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,000
I wonder what it means

894
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,000
are you planning on

895
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,000
getting me pregnant

896
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,000
hmm

897
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,000
I knew color scheme

898
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,000
you were already pregnant one

899
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,000
would be a shame

900
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,000
if you got me pregnant again

901
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,000
on my birthday

902
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,000
what do the colors mean

903
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,000
my birthday is October 10th

904
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,000
for no particular reason

905
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,000
oh I'll tell you one thing

906
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,000
that should be nice

907
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,000
doing two different triggers at once

908
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,000
if I

909
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,000
I don't have polydactyl

910
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,000
no it's not polydactyl

911
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,000
Draco, thank you for the friendly

912
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,000
those nips are turning brown

913
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,000
will be like oh no

914
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,000
Mainstay pink

915
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,000
I'm going out for a scratch bar

916
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,000
you can do two different

917
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,000
tingles at once

918
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,000
you must forgive me I do not have dexterity

919
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,000
in both hands

920
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,000
ambidexterity there we go

921
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,000
you were already pregnant

922
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,000
before

923
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,000
same birthday mother

924
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,000
we love Vivi ASMR

925
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,000
she's amazing

926
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:22,000
it would be funny

927
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,000
to have a pregnant audio

928
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,000
nine months before a new time comes

929
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:28,000
wouldn't it

930
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,000
that would be hilarious

931
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,000
I'm afraid I can't count

932
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,000
the numbers

933
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,000
they're pink

934
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,000
have you seen the color

935
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,000
of my skin

936
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,000
what other color would they be

937
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,000
I'm translucent

938
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:48,000
you can see the veins

939
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,000
you can literally see the veins

940
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,000
what color would I be

941
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,000
if I wasn't pink

942
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,000
please elaborate

943
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:00,000
I'm transparent sir

944
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,000
I will give you the hex code

945
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,000
if you'd like

946
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,000
so you can do

947
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,000
combination tingles

948
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,000
they're not my favorite

949
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,000
where's my pencil

950
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,000
this one's different

951
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,000
green maybe

952
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:18,000
I'm see-through

953
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:20,000
you could find a strong engine

954
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:22,000
where I'm covered in bruises

955
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:24,000
where I ride my bike I always get tons of bruises

956
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,000
so this is literally

957
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,000
just regular

958
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:30,000
regular, regular pencil

959
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:34,000
and you can do combo

960
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:38,000
and you can do a little love heart

961
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:40,000
oh it's upside down

962
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:42,000
let me do it this way for you

963
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,000
oh

964
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,000
and some people

965
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,000
enjoy

966
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,000
course ASMR

967
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,000
so this is course

968
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,000
some people

969
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:56,000
adore course ASMR

970
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:58,000
there's also crinkly

971
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,000
ASMR enjoyers

972
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,000
there's like white noise and deep sound

973
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,000
ASMR enjoyers

974
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,000
crinkly would go into like latex

975
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,000
crinkle

976
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,000
there's so

977
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:12,000
there's like

978
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,000
how would I call tapping ASMR

979
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,000
is clean

980
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,000
and quick ASMR

981
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,000
for me there's subcategories

982
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:22,000
I don't know if you would agree with me

983
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,000
I don't know if you would agree with me

984
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,000
that there's definitely subcategories of ASMR

985
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:30,000
but me I think so

986
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:34,000
like clean

987
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,000
tingles I would say

988
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,000
there's like the tapping

989
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:40,000
that some people would enjoy

990
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,000
but then moving

991
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,000
you could go like

992
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,000
tapping sounds deeper

993
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,000
that's clean

994
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:58,000
I like when an ASMR

995
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,000
she uses her hair for ASMR

996
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,000
it's too short

997
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:04,000
that's all the hair you get

998
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,000
that's all you get

999
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,000
that's all you get

1000
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:10,000
I don't even know

1001
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:12,000
if anyone can hear them

1002
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,000
yeah

1003
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:16,000
it's so good

1004
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,000
long hair grows

1005
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,000
I mean I'm going out again

1006
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,000
it's been years

1007
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,000
time I see her

1008
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,000
but yes you can also

1009
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,000
combine ASMR

1010
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:30,000
with different

1011
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,000
tingles

1012
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,000
I enjoy tracing

1013
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:36,000
like visual tracing

1014
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:38,000
like just following

1015
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:40,000
your

1016
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,000
following my finger

1017
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,000
people kind of like instructions

1018
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:46,000
ASMR

1019
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:48,000
just let

1020
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:50,000
my finger go a little

1021
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:52,000
spiral

1022
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:54,000
and we get

1023
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:56,000
my system

1024
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,000
and just

1025
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,000
a smile

1026
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:04,000
a joy

1027
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,000
your little kisses

1028
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,000
with lovey-dovey

1029
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:16,000
instructions

1030
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:18,000
ten

1031
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:20,000
no I'm fucking me

1032
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,000
I'm fucking me

1033
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,000
still

1034
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:26,000
no

1035
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:28,000
maybe

1036
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:30,000
Shani doesn't have huge army twin tails

1037
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,000
I have baby twin tails

1038
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:34,000
I'm going with my hero

1039
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:36,000
give me a chance

1040
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:38,000
do I have any more ASMR tingles

1041
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:42,000
I would just do

1042
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:44,000
hold on I'm just grabbing

1043
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:46,000
a few more tingles

1044
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:56,000
I think there's another one

1045
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,000
I think we'll have this

1046
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:10,000
now as much as I love this one

1047
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:12,000
it's got like these wee squidgy balls inside

1048
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:14,000
the only thing is

1049
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:16,000
this fabric like the thing it's made of

1050
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:18,000
gets all sticky and covered in cat hair

1051
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:20,000
so there's cat hair all over the place

1052
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:26,000
wait what's wrong with the visual

1053
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:28,000
what do you mean you don't like my pointy sharp nails

1054
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:30,000
going into this ball like

1055
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:32,000
object

1056
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:34,000
why are you scared

1057
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:36,000
don't be scared

1058
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:38,000
why are you terrified

1059
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:40,000
don't be terrified

1060
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:42,000
I don't know

1061
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:00,000
where is your motivation

1062
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:02,000
my motivation lies

1063
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:04,000
in the ink

1064
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,000
I don't even make enough

1065
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:08,000
oh there's a cat here

1066
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:10,000
ok

1067
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:20,000
grab a stick and twist

1068
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:28,000
that's how I make that camera

1069
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:30,000
a deep person

1070
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:36,000
oh you guys know like that one

1071
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:40,000
I just clear up

1072
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:42,000
let me clear up

1073
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:44,000
your ears with this

1074
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:46,000
regular makeup pad

1075
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:54,000
slime girl they use more

1076
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:56,000
how do you

1077
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:00,000
cut a fish scratch with that itch

1078
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:02,000
man

1079
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:04,000
cut a fish pinches and moves for you

1080
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:10,000
and

1081
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:14,000
it's funny as a slime girl

1082
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:16,000
why do you hate me

1083
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:18,000
I'm not a slime girl

1084
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:20,000
I'm a girl that slimes

1085
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:22,000
but I'm not a slime girl

1086
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:24,000
do I

1087
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:26,000
make myself clear

1088
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:32,000
I brought over this hair band

1089
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:34,000
but I don't think it's going to do that

1090
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:36,000
kind of a deeper cat

1091
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:38,000
can I even put it on your ears

1092
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:40,000
oh you look like a pretty little princess

1093
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:46,000
what might work

1094
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:48,000
I have no idea what you hear right now

1095
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:54,000
we're all a bit slime brained

1096
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:58,000
I forgot she was touched at me

1097
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:00,000
you make a slime

1098
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:02,000
yeah

1099
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:04,000
I feel bonito

1100
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:06,000
7000 sub video

1101
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:08,000
when soon

1102
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:10,000
not just yet but very soon

1103
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:12,000
7000 subscriber

1104
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:14,000
milestone is coming soon

1105
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:16,000
I have a collab

1106
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:18,000
or two for

1107
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:20,000
oh hi there

1108
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:22,000
it sounds bouncy

1109
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:24,000
7 million subscriber

1110
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:26,000
I think I'll

1111
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:28,000
just relax at 100k

1112
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:30,000
I think I'll be satisfied

1113
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:32,000
as long as it's not alien

1114
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:34,000
slime at times

1115
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:36,000
so you get me a little too much

1116
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:42,000
sounds good

1117
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:44,000
you like it

1118
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:46,000
I'll keep going for you

1119
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:48,000
if you like it

1120
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:50,000
okay

1121
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:52,000
I'll go for as long as you need

1122
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:56,000
as long as you're having a good time

1123
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:58,000
okay

1124
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:00,000
yeah

1125
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:02,000
okay

1126
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:04,000
I think we may

1127
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:06,000
let's see which way

1128
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:08,000
this is so much better

1129
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:12,000
I'll see if I can get like

1130
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:14,000
to keep it there

1131
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:16,000
thank god

1132
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:22,000
it's starting to voice

1133
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:24,000
okay

1134
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:26,000
I think I'll do like soft spoken

1135
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:28,000
and remove that accent

1136
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:30,000
at some time

1137
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:32,000
please understand me

1138
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:34,000
what else had

1139
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:36,000
me sounding like this

1140
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:38,000
yeah a bit of tingle

1141
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:40,000
aren't you big man

1142
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:42,000
so when you have the whole world

1143
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:44,000
subscribed to you

1144
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:46,000
what then

1145
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:48,000
I'll make

1146
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:50,000
video games

1147
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:52,000
did you

1148
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:54,000
slowly scratch the part

1149
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:56,000
between the ears of the video

1150
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:58,000
this bit

1151
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:00,000
okay

1152
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:02,000
like here

1153
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:04,000
on the index finger

1154
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:10,000
like that

1155
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:18,000
I can cut diamonds on the top of that

1156
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:20,000
that

1157
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:22,000
I can do a bit of this

1158
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:24,000
try

1159
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:26,000
hold on

1160
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:28,000
hold on

1161
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:34,000
I'm trying to be gentle

1162
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:38,000
it's pain

1163
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:40,000
rarely anything

1164
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:42,000
I mean I can do it harder

1165
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:44,000
you want it harder

1166
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:50,000
okay

1167
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:54,000
there's a center of the ear break

1168
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:56,000
you just scratch your ear

1169
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:58,000
harder

1170
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:00,000
you want it harder

1171
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:02,000
okay I'll put this

1172
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:04,000
on you and then I'll do it harder

1173
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:14,000
you want to like

1174
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:16,000
scratch with like that

1175
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:18,000
you want it like that

1176
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:22,000
go harder

1177
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:28,000

1178
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:30,000

1179
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:32,000

1180
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:34,000
thank you

1181
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:36,000
thank you

1182
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:38,000
oh yeah you like that

1183
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:40,000
did you with the ear

1184
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:42,000
so it's pretty good

1185
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:44,000
mixed two triggers

1186
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:46,000
together

1187
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:48,000
do this at the same time

1188
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:50,000
am I coordinating this

1189
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:52,000
no it has to be one handed

1190
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:54,000
I can do one handed

1191
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:56,000
just behind

1192
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:06,000
regarding the

1193
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:08,000
oh it's this

1194
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:10,000
I don't know

1195
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:16,000
is that

1196
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:20,000
don't use the elastic

1197
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:30,000
marriage stream lens

1198
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:32,000
I can do that

1199
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:34,000
I would have to go buy a white dress

1200
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:36,000
so

1201
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:38,000
the rim of the earmuffs is

1202
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:42,000
don't apologize

1203
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:44,000
can you

1204
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:46,000
can you do just the

1205
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:48,000
band of the earmuffs

1206
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:54,000
what

1207
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:56,000
I think I can go and make sure

1208
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:58,000
of it there

1209
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:04,000
got your little text

1210
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:06,000
you're still having the issue

1211
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:08,000
hmm

1212
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:12,000

1213
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:14,000
go

1214
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:16,000
over your ears

1215
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:18,000
that's the

1216
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:30,000
you don't have a spare wedding dress

1217
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:32,000
not when you go to church

1218
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:34,000
or when you get a wheelchair

1219
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:38,000
hmm

1220
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:40,000
I wouldn't buy a wedding dress

1221
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:42,000
no I just buy a white dress

1222
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:44,000
and get like a body con dress

1223
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:46,000
it hugs all of my curves

1224
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:50,000
I call me the one

1225
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:56,000

00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:20,000
don't know how low

1232
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:22,000
those are

1233
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:24,000
we can just

1234
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:26,000
do-do-do-do

1235
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:28,000

1236
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:30,000

00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:52,000
okay time for you to hear my heart

1244
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:54,000
but you have to go

1245
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:56,000
under my hoodie in order to hear my heart

1246
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:58,000
so surprise I actually

1247
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:08,000
up and under

1248
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:16,000
does it sound all muffled

1249
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:18,000
because you're under the hoodie

1250
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:22,000
I don't know if I can

1251
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:26,000
distract you visually

1252
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:36,000
you can't hear my heart

1253
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:42,000
where's my heart

1254
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:44,000
hold on

1255
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:52,000
hold on

1256
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:54,000
I can hear it quiet

1257
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:00,000
I'm not fucking myself

1258
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:14,000

1262
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:26,000
it worked

1263
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:30,000
we all needed to do

1264
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:32,000
squish you a bit harder

1265
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:38,000

1273
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:06,000

1290
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:50,000
under a good finisher

1291
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:52,000

1294
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:08,000
so you guys aren't gonna be very familiar

1295
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:10,000
with the units of pleasure

1296
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:12,000
don't think it's gonna be there

1297
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:20,000
you like the name

1298
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:22,000
yeah

1299
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:26,000
centimedes the birdie

1300
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:30,000
everyone says I got such a small hand

1301
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:32,000
I measure it from bottom

1302
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:34,000
6 centimedes

1303
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:38,000
from the bottom

1304
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:40,000
I wrap my little pinky

1305
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:42,000

see my eyes

1311
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:02,000
see how it looks like spiral

1312
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:04,000
I don't know if you can see it

1313
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:06,000
I'm hypnotizing

1314
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:12,000
you really got all the basic back to things

1315
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:14,000
of that

1316
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:16,000
6 centimedes this year

1318
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:20,000

1319
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:22,000
3 of these

1320
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:24,000
what's on the back of the keychains

1321
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:26,000
you're gonna shit yourself

1322
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:28,000
are you ready for what's on the back of them

1323
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:30,000
boom

1324
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:32,000
it's just the back

1325
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:34,000
of the design

1326
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:38,000
what am I

1327
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:42,000
is that a 30 centimede

1328
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:44,000
well your hands are enormous

1329
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:46,000
no it's 15 centimedes

1330
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:48,000
you goober this is 15 centimedes

1331
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:50,000
you thought my hands were like

1332
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:52,000
over like how long

1333
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:54,000
it's 15 centimedes

1334
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:56,000
okay

1335
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:58,000
I wrap my hands around the broken

1336
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:06,000
you thought my hand was 30 centimedes

1337
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:08,000
get out of here

1338
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:10,000
I like your accent

1339
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:12,000
I spawned with it

1340
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:14,000
but we never even got to the best part

1341
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:16,000
yeah

1342
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:18,000
time to change you up

1343
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:24,000
I would pretend to put it on

1344
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:26,000
but it's a rather reflective surface

1345
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:28,000
so I'll put this in half

1346
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:30,000
you put me in a collier

1347
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:32,000
so I'm putting you in

1348
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:34,000
is that for walkies

1349
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:36,000
yes you're a very special walkie

1350
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:38,000
but

1351
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:40,000
these

1352
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:42,000
beautiful beautiful things

1353
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:44,000
are ear cleaners

1354
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:46,000
but you might notice that I've

1355
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:48,000
put some of the fabric away on purpose

1356
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:50,000
the reason

1357
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:52,000
because this actually sounds better

1358
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:54,000
the first thing that's been done

1359
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:58,000
is ear cleaners

1360
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:00,000
I believe you call them

1361
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:02,000
Q-tips

1362
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:04,000
these are Tesco's finest

1363
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:06,000
they came all the way with me

1364
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:10,000
and I can just

1365
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:18,000
but it's the same deal

1366
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:20,000
I can make this

1367
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:22,000
touch the black

1368
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:24,000
this doesn't sound very right

1369
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:28,000
but the Q-tips

1370
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:30,000
you have to be a bit quieter

1371
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:32,000
and how do you call them

1372
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:34,000
these are ear cleaners

1373
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:44,000
you can be a bit louder

1374
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:46,000
on the outer earlobe area

1375
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:48,000
this really shouldn't affect

1376
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:50,000
the recording quality

1377
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:52,000
or anything like that

1378
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:54,000
but if you go on the inside

1379
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:56,000
gentle

1380
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:58,000
and if you pull out

1381
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:00,000
the threading

1382
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:02,000
the cotton

1383
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:04,000
you can actually just

1384
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:06,000
spin it

1385
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:08,000
no, it will not ever sound as good as the Japanese

1386
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:10,000
ear cleaners

1387
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:20,000
that's her

1388
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:24,000
okay, I think that

1389
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:28,000
okay, let's do the next

1390
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:30,000
so

1391
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:36,000
I can do two at a time

1392
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:38,000
and you can purposefully

1393
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:40,000
now you can either mimic each hand

1394
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:42,000
and tell each hand to do the same thing

1395
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:44,000
at the exact same time

1396
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:46,000
which is possible

1397
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:50,000
if you want to try

1398
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:52,000
to sync up the audio

1399
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:54,000
on both sides

1400
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:56,000
or

1401
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:58,000
just fully do different things

1402
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:00,000
to make it sound

1403
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:02,000
a bit more unique

1404
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:04,000
like you can start at different

1405
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:06,000
locations

1406
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:08,000
maybe spin one

1407
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:12,000
sometimes hearing the exact

1408
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:14,000
same thing from the ear

1409
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:16,000
isn't the best

1410
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:18,000
the knot is tingly

1411
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:20,000
and

1412
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:26,000
you just need to

1413
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:32,000
the ear cleaning

1414
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:34,000
the Q-tips in particular

1415
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:36,000
can be

1416
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:38,000
they can sometimes let off

1417
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:40,000
a bit of a rough noise

1418
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:42,000
which isn't very pleasant

1419
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:44,000
and it has to be edited

1420
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:46,000
post recording

1421
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:48,000
art especially is more

1422
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:54,000
the knot is tingly

1423
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:56,000
I remember I said knot

1424
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:02,000
how dare you

1425
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:04,000
how dare you

1426
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:06,000
I totally didn't look up at something

1427
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:08,000
it just hangs without

1428
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:14,000
yeah, it can be a bit scratchy

1429
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:16,000
so you need to be careful

1430
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:18,000
if you do live ASMR videos

1431
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:20,000
you gotta be careful

1432
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:22,000
but you can't tap on it

1433
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:24,000
if you have multiple Q-tips

1434
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:26,000
in a room

1435
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:28,000
you can actually bend your finger

1436
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:30,000
and

1437
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:36,000
you can get rid of them

1438
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:38,000
especially if you're recording

1439
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:40,000
a visual video

1440
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:42,000
so if you see this brush

1441
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:44,000
you're only going to hear a brush

1442
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:46,000
so then if I cheekily slip in a little

1443
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:48,000
you can hear me

1444
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:50,000
adjust the tool

1445
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:52,000
you can hear my skin against it

1446
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:54,000
you can hear my nails clacking

1447
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:56,000
your brain might be surprised

1448
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:58,000
and

1449
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:00,000
I can offer you

1450
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:02,000
a tingle

1451
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:04,000
okay

1452
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:06,000
we're recording now

1453
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:12,000
I never said anything about

1454
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:14,000
a new product

1455
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:18,000
should I feel like something

1456
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:22,000
alright, these ones today

1457
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:24,000
we are playing with

1458
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:26,000
cork ASMR

1459
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:30,000
I'm just running

1460
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:32,000
up

1461
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:34,000
and

1462
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:36,000
cork

1463
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:38,000
over and over again

1464
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:44,000
just tapping

1465
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:46,000
with my nail

1466
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:50,000
I can just tap

1467
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:52,000
tap

1468
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:54,000
tap

1469
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:56,000
tap

1470
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:58,000
tap

1471
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:00,000
and you'll let me

1472
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:02,000
just touch

1473
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:04,000
over here

1474
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:08,000
in your ear

1475
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:12,000
and

1476
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:14,000
scratch your back

1477
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:16,000
and let off

1478
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:20,000
yeah

1479
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:24,000
maybe even

1480
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:26,000
right here

1481
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:30,000
scratch

1482
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:32,000
scratch

1483
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:34,000
scratch

1484
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:36,000
and tap

1485
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:38,000
over here

1486
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:42,000
all year long

1487
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:44,000
here

1488
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:48,000
for my victim

1489
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:50,000
to my Scottish tank

1490
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:52,000
for

1491
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:54,000
this cork on your ear

1492
01:11:58,000 --> 01:12:00,000
scratch

1493
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:02,000
scratch

1494
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:04,000
scratch

1495
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:06,000
no, I just told you

1496
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:08,000
I don't care

1497
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:10,000
about cork

1498
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:14,000
I like when you're

1499
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:16,000
a good boy

1500
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:18,000
and expand

1501
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:22,000
that all you have to do

1502
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:24,000
is please

1503
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:26,000
please

1504
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:30,000
keep me happy

1505
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:34,000
because when I'm happy

1506
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:38,000
I reward you

1507
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:40,000
to move

1508
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:52,000
what do you do

1509
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:54,000
and

1510
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:56,000
you don't get rewarded

1511
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:00,000
do you want to be rewarded

1512
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:04,000
for not taking these of course

1513
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:10,000
the best part

1514
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:12,000
about the reward

1515
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:18,000
and it would be such

1516
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:20,000
a shame

1517
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:24,000
if you missed

1518
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:26,000
the

1519
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:28,000
just one

1520
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:30,000
say

1521
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:44,000
I'd love to

1522
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:46,000
talk to you

1523
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:48,000
I would love to

1524
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:50,000
talk to you

1525
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:52,000
and

1526
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:54,000
some people like

1527
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:56,000
this kind of retouch

1528
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:02,000
I'll do a bit of a comfort

1529
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:22,000
thank you for today's training

1530
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:24,000
thank you

1531
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:34,000
I wonder if I'm blindfolded

1532
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:36,000
or if it would be more fun

1533
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:38,000
if you turned us over

1534
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:40,000
I still have you

1535
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:42,000
hold on I've still got you

1536
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:46,000
you're not abandoning me

1537
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:48,000
just

1538
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:52,000
if you

1539
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:54,000
excuse me babies

1540
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:56,000
can I make something for a refund

1541
01:14:58,000 --> 01:15:00,000
I'll put them right here

1542
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:02,000
I'll put them right here

1543
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:16,000
now if you're asking for

1544
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:18,000
a handcam

1545
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:20,000
ASMR

1546
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:32,000
this is very hard

1547
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:34,000
to orchestrate

1548
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:36,000
having a refund

1549
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:40,000
one thing

1550
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:44,000
a gc

1551
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:50,000
hmm

1552
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:52,000
what have you been doing

1553
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:56,000
I don't know

1554
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:58,000
you saw me

1555
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:02,000
you've been laying here

1556
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:14,000
give me some head pads

1557
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:16,000
for being such a good boy

1558
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:20,000
so good

1559
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:26,000
are you sure this hand

1560
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:30,000
what else is tense

1561
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:32,000
in the refund

1562
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:34,000
than your arms maybe

1563
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:36,000
is it tense

1564
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:40,000
are you sure it's tense

1565
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:42,000
tense

1566
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:44,000
person should be fine

1567
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:46,000
are you telling me

1568
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:48,000
where else is tense

1569
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:54,000
you saw me

1570
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:58,000
you just stopped me

1571
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:00,000
where it's so

1572
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:02,000
okay

1573
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:06,000
you remember

1574
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:10,000
oh dear

1575
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:14,000
oh you're gonna need some

1576
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:16,000
special treatment aren't you

1577
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:18,000
I heard I'll fix you

1578
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:20,000
because I know I can fix you

1579
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:26,000
now I know I'm supposed to

1580
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:28,000
protect myself

1581
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:30,000
from the patient

1582
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:32,000
by wearing gloves

1583
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:34,000
but since it's you

1584
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:36,000
I can take these off

1585
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:38,000
sorry my hands are sweaty

1586
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:40,000
but because it's you

1587
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:42,000
I'll make an exception

1588
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:44,000
because I need to adapt

1589
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:46,000
don't I

1590
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:48,000
why are you looking for a doll

1591
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:50,000
a doll's name

1592
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:54,000
thank you

1593
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:56,000
you're welcome

1594
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:04,000
I know this isn't a correct protocol

1595
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:06,000
for me

1596
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:08,000
I'm willing to break company

1597
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:20,000
if you look at that

1598
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:22,000
there is

1599
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:24,000
a little bit less tense

1600
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:26,000
it's like a massage

1601
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:28,000
it's like

1602
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:38,000
it still has a nifty touch

1603
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:40,000
because it's nifty

1604
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:42,000
you

1605
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:50,000
you mean hold your hand

1606
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:52,000
and get in

1607
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:54,000
you think you're born

1608
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:56,000
you need to work

1609
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:58,000
at something

1610
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:00,000
do

1611
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:02,000
you

1612
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:20,000
I'm good at rubbing

1613
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:26,000
at this pressure point

1614
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:28,000
this little reform

1615
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:30,000
it's an acupuncture

1616
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:32,000
but he has very correct

1617
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:34,000
anatomy

1618
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:36,000
so I have to cover him

1619
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:42,000
I have to cover you up

1620
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:44,000
because you have a very accurate

1621
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:46,000
part here

1622
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:50,000
the vacancy

1623
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:52,000
70

1624
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:54,000
no

1625
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:56,000
50

1626
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:58,000
like 45

1627
01:19:58,000 --> 01:20:00,000
give me

1628
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:06,000
you want to say hi to the reasons

1629
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:08,000
look we're here

1630
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:10,000
hi baby girl

1631
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:12,000
she doesn't know what to do

1632
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:14,000
because of the ASMR

1633
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:16,000
baby girl

1634
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:18,000
are you coming in or not

1635
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:20,000
if not have a carry on out there

1636
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:22,000
I'm trying to think of some

1637
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:24,000
wait that's right

1638
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:26,000
what should we do

1639
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:38,000
obviously

1640
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:40,000
the ASMR girls are going to have to come

1641
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:42,000
so shebe's going to

1642
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:44,000
can I have stuff that's in here

1643
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:46,000
oh my gosh

1644
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:48,000
okay so shebe's going to help

1645
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:50,000
with your hands

1646
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:52,000
Mary she's going to do

1647
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:54,000
under your armpit

1648
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:56,000
oh shit

1649
01:20:56,000 --> 01:20:58,000
I'm actually a little bit shy

1650
01:20:58,000 --> 01:21:00,000
okay

1651
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:02,000
acu's going to claw the fuck out of your back

1652
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:08,000
again we hate this

1653
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:10,000
she doesn't like it when I'm doing

1654
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:12,000
she doesn't like when I stream all the time

1655
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:14,000
that's a zero

1656
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:16,000
Amy will help your headache

1657
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:18,000
and for no particular

1658
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:20,000
reason

1659
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:22,000
she's going to be great

1660
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:24,000
she will

1661
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:28,000
surrounded by cute girls

1662
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:30,000
you will

1663
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:40,000
let me just

1664
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:44,000
everything is looking good

1665
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:46,000
let me

1666
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:50,000
remove the cuties

1667
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:54,000
I'll leave me there

1668
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:56,000
for no particular reason

1669
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:02,000
just using the underwears

1670
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:04,000
I'm going to get a nice little

1671
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:06,000
you saved me

1672
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:10,000
okay

1673
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:12,000
I'm just

1674
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:14,000
cause you can make a

1675
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:16,000
really big mark if you have enough there

1676
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:18,000
okay

1677
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:24,000
that's the

1678
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:26,000
that's the string

1679
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:44,000
look at the

1680
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:46,000
swabs of people

1681
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:48,000
I should oil up my feet

1682
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:50,000
like Amy did

1683
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:52,000
I thoroughly enjoyed Amy's oiled up feet

1684
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:54,000
I don't know

1685
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:04,000
the smell

1686
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:06,000
not the grippy socks

1687
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:08,000
you never heard of hate from each other

1688
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:10,000
the grippy socks before

1689
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:12,000
you want to faint do

1690
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:16,000
I'm so sorry

1691
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:18,000
give me a sec at the door

1692
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:32,000
for that

1693
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:34,000
with her is her item

1694
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:36,000
a lot of money

1695
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:38,000
it's mine

1696
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:42,000
we need a feet cam

1697
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:44,000
here's my life string

1698
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:46,000
I've already done that

1699
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:48,000
but I'm open to doing more

1700
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:50,000
for no particular reason

1701
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:52,000
we should check out my monetization

1702
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:54,000
string

1703
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:02,000
you want to compare with him though

1704
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:04,000
no

1705
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:06,000
I don't think I can show my

1706
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:08,000
button

1707
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:10,000
I don't think I can show my collar

1708
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:12,000
no I can

1709
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:14,000
so you know how I've got that manicure

1710
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:16,000
pedicure thing

1711
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:18,000
it's still stuck on my feet

1712
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:20,000
like it's not there

1713
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:22,000
and then my feet don't look that very nice

1714
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:24,000
from the bottom

1715
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:26,000
I don't know if I could like oil them up

1716
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:28,000
and make it look a bit nicer

1717
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:30,000
wait for it

1718
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:32,000
I was going to oil them up

1719
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:34,000
maybe for a foot cam string

1720
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:38,000
where's the crust

1721
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:44,000
cause like I do have my oil

1722
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:46,000
my coconut oil

1723
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:52,000
this is the holy grail

1724
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:54,000
my coconut oil

1725
01:24:56,000 --> 01:24:58,000
it goes with me everywhere

1726
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:04,000
do it now

1727
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:06,000
I don't have a towel

1728
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:08,000
what do you want me to get a towel

1729
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:12,000
no I'll make it a milestone

1730
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:14,000
fuck you

1731
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:16,000
I'll make it a milestone so you better like and subscribe

1732
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:20,000
cause

1733
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:22,000
for 25,000 we're doing

1734
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:24,000
something

1735
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:26,000
the vangaba

1736
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:28,000
that's what I like to call it

1737
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:30,000
your feet look hot

1738
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:32,000
from the underneath

1739
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:34,000
I mean

1740
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:36,000
they look hot or wrapped around your

1741
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:38,000
gotta let them know

1742
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:40,000
these clothes are on for 10% off

1743
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:42,000
do not ask

1744
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:44,000
who the vangaba is coming

1745
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:46,000
for it is coming for the

1746
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:48,000
I don't know

1747
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:50,000
I don't know

1748
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:52,000
I don't know

1749
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:54,000
I don't know

1750
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:56,000
I don't know

1751
01:25:56,000 --> 01:25:58,000
maybe

1752
01:25:58,000 --> 01:26:00,000
try

1753
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:06,000
we have feet

1754
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:08,000
ahead of us

1755
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:18,000
do you have any tingle requests

1756
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:24,000
or is there any particular tingle you want me to try again

1757
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:28,000
are you just enjoying

1758
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:32,000
the teasing nature

1759
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:40,000
a tiny bit of smithing

1760
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:42,000
I don't think they allow smithing

1761
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:44,000
I'm so sorry

1762
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:46,000
I don't know what to do

1763
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:48,000
I'm waiting until my morning is up

1764
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:50,000
before the morning

1765
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:52,000
do your towel

1766
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:54,000
ok so

1767
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:56,000
one you go to an accountant

1768
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:58,000
two

1769
01:26:58,000 --> 01:27:00,000
you have to tell them what you're doing

1770
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:02,000
I'm entertaining industry

1771
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:04,000
you love the nails

1772
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:06,000
I'm glad you like them

1773
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:08,000
I like the nails too

1774
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:10,000
I feel very

1775
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:12,000
thin and I'm actually tempted

1776
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:14,000
to keep going with the nails

1777
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:20,000
is it touch less restricted with ASMR

1778
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:22,000
yes but the problem is none of my

1779
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:24,000
gen mates can go on ASMR

1780
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:26,000
not even my outfit is

1781
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:28,000
appropriate for a twitch

1782
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:30,000
I would literally get banned

1783
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:32,000
on twitch if I streamed

1784
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:34,000
on it

1785
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:38,000
keep going with the nails

1786
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:40,000
yeah you want more nails

1787
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:42,000
honestly I just might

1788
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:44,000
I really like them

1789
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:46,000
but I would need to do more hand

1790
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:48,000
you want mechanical

1791
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:50,000
you want mechanical

1792
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:52,000
keyboard

1793
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:54,000
oh did your feet get better

1794
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:56,000
after pedicure

1795
01:27:56,000 --> 01:27:58,000
yeah I have nails

1796
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:02,000
guess which one is

1797
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:04,000
missing through my spokes

1798
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:06,000
oh you can't see

1799
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:08,000
guess which one doesn't have

1800
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:10,000
a nail

1801
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:12,000
right type number one

1802
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:14,000
if you think this is the one without a nail

1803
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:16,000
and then type number two

1804
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:18,000
if you think this is the one without a nail

1805
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:24,000
I'll be interested to see

1806
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:28,000
oh I think you guys are ready

1807
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:30,000
it's number one

1808
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:32,000
what's this one

1809
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:34,000
I do not have a nail

1810
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:36,000
and then a mumbic

1811
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:38,000
too but we can't learn

1812
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:40,000
time

1813
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:42,000
yeah

1814
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:46,000
we heard a scratch from

1815
01:28:46,000 --> 01:28:48,000
no way

1816
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:50,000
we can hear the fucking difference

1817
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:52,000
between not having a nail

1818
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:54,000
having a nail

1819
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:56,000
what happened

1820
01:28:56,000 --> 01:28:58,000
a Vietnamese lady attacked me

1821
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:02,000
and she stole my toenail

1822
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:08,000
and I tipped her $20

1823
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:10,000
and she started taking my toenail

1824
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:16,000
so the Vietnamese lady that

1825
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:18,000
knows the toenail

1826
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:20,000
and that she was actually the

1827
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:22,000
toenail

1828
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:24,000
it's Julia

1829
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:26,000
and that's pretty much the story

1830
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:32,000
the feet animals has begun

1831
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:34,000
the judge will soon score

1832
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:36,000
a more unique feet

1833
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:38,000
no

1834
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:40,000
she often did often these

1835
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:46,000
can I be the replacement

1836
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:48,000
of my toenail

1837
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:50,000
you want me to glue you to my feet

1838
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:54,000
does it hurt

1839
01:29:54,000 --> 01:29:56,000
no there's no pain at all

1840
01:29:56,000 --> 01:29:58,000
actually now that it's fully healed

1841
01:29:58,000 --> 01:30:00,000
it feels better to

1842
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:02,000
stub this

1843
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:04,000
whole nail list foot

1844
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:06,000
than it is to stub the one with the toenail

1845
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:10,000
this one hurts

1846
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:12,000
this one doesn't hurt

1847
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:14,000
I officially am immune to stubbing my toenail

1848
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:26,000
no I went to the

1849
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:28,000
she's a shit ass for a man

1850
01:30:28,000 --> 01:30:30,000
I went to the doctor and the doctor was like

1851
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:32,000
okay this is what you've got

1852
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:34,000
here's your options and I was like

1853
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:36,000
I didn't get back to streaming I don't have time for this

1854
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:38,000
just take the damn thing

1855
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:40,000
I was like I don't have time for this

1856
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:42,000
I don't have time for this

1857
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:44,000
I've got work to do

1858
01:30:54,000 --> 01:30:56,000
Gimli I can

1859
01:30:56,000 --> 01:30:58,000
hear you out there

1860
01:30:58,000 --> 01:31:00,000
sorry it's raining

1861
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:02,000
which means Gimli looks

1862
01:31:02,000 --> 01:31:04,000
so more active

1863
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:08,000
the tongue again

1864
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:10,000
does my tongue keep coming out on my tracking

1865
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:12,000
no don't

1866
01:31:20,000 --> 01:31:22,000
we in actual is more

1867
01:31:22,000 --> 01:31:24,000
oh I didn't know that my tracking's there

1868
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:26,000
oh well obviously

1869
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:28,000
I can't see it from this POV

1870
01:31:28,000 --> 01:31:30,000
did you hurt your thumb

1871
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:32,000
no it's to cover up ugly

1872
01:31:34,000 --> 01:31:36,000
I was put in there and they give me all the confidence

1873
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:38,000
in the world

1874
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:44,000
I wonder if I could put it on

1875
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:50,000
I do have all the micro stars

1876
01:31:50,000 --> 01:31:52,000
from Onan cats

1877
01:31:52,000 --> 01:31:54,000
I don't know if you can see that one

1878
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:56,000
you can see that one

1879
01:31:56,000 --> 01:31:58,000
yeah cats are dangerous

1880
01:31:58,000 --> 01:32:00,000
like I have a scar on my boob

1881
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:02,000
from picking up feral kitten

1882
01:32:04,000 --> 01:32:06,000
I don't know if I can take a photo

1883
01:32:06,000 --> 01:32:08,000
and show you

1884
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:10,000
but I have a scar

1885
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:12,000
because I picked up a feral kitten

1886
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:14,000
and it got me cured

1887
01:32:14,000 --> 01:32:16,000
my fucking thing got me cured

1888
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:18,000
okay

1889
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:22,000
blue bird

1890
01:32:22,000 --> 01:32:24,000
yeah it's like right next to my boob

1891
01:32:24,000 --> 01:32:26,000
so nip nip

1892
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:36,000
I feel like my visual remodels

1893
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:38,000
are covering up way more than it was

1894
01:32:38,000 --> 01:32:40,000
like the stars

1895
01:32:42,000 --> 01:32:44,000
much before

1896
01:32:44,000 --> 01:32:46,000
you liked your thigh video

1897
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:50,000
or the live stream

1898
01:32:50,000 --> 01:32:52,000
the thigh live stream did well

1899
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:54,000
it's my second most watched live stream

1900
01:32:54,000 --> 01:32:56,000
after the hypnosis one

1901
01:32:58,000 --> 01:33:00,000
I need to write the script for the hypnosis one tomorrow

1902
01:33:04,000 --> 01:33:06,000
the live stream of the thigh can

1903
01:33:06,000 --> 01:33:08,000
yeah you like the part where I ripped my tights open

1904
01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:10,000
yeah baby

1905
01:33:14,000 --> 01:33:16,000
I can't

1906
01:33:16,000 --> 01:33:18,000
I'm afraid I can't

1907
01:33:18,000 --> 01:33:20,000
rip these

1908
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:22,000
although I do have a stalking in here

1909
01:33:22,000 --> 01:33:24,000
here

1910
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:26,000
do you want me to put this on

1911
01:33:26,000 --> 01:33:28,000
I have one stalking

1912
01:33:28,000 --> 01:33:30,000
I don't know where the other one went

1913
01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:32,000
I went to Mars

1914
01:33:32,000 --> 01:33:34,000
but I could put it on right now if you want

1915
01:33:34,000 --> 01:33:36,000
I'm not ripping it

1916
01:33:36,000 --> 01:33:38,000
before you ask because I don't know

1917
01:33:38,000 --> 01:33:40,000
where the heck the other stalking is

1918
01:33:40,000 --> 01:33:42,000
why only one

1919
01:33:42,000 --> 01:33:44,000
I've lost the other one

1920
01:33:44,000 --> 01:33:46,000
I have no idea where it went

1921
01:33:46,000 --> 01:33:48,000
I literally went to Mars

1922
01:33:48,000 --> 01:33:50,000
one singular stalking

1923
01:33:54,000 --> 01:33:56,000
proof that's me leggings

1924
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:02,000
oh no I have to take off my sock

1925
01:34:02,000 --> 01:34:04,000
I can't believe it

1926
01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:10,000
sorry I stole it

1927
01:34:10,000 --> 01:34:12,000
I don't know

1928
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:22,000
you can kind of see the pedicure

1929
01:34:22,000 --> 01:34:24,000
that's still on my big toe

1930
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:26,000
do you see the shine on my big toe

1931
01:34:26,000 --> 01:34:28,000
don't go pedicure

1932
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:30,000
how do I show you that

1933
01:34:30,000 --> 01:34:32,000
I've got a stalking on

1934
01:34:32,000 --> 01:34:34,000
that was your collar

1935
01:34:34,000 --> 01:34:36,000
you can just see one naked leg

1936
01:34:36,000 --> 01:34:38,000
and then the sock on it

1937
01:34:38,000 --> 01:34:40,000
that's what it looks like

1938
01:34:40,000 --> 01:34:42,000
that's the strength

1939
01:34:42,000 --> 01:34:44,000
there you go

1940
01:34:44,000 --> 01:34:46,000
boom

1941
01:34:46,000 --> 01:34:48,000
boom

1942
01:34:48,000 --> 01:34:50,000
kiss it

1943
01:34:54,000 --> 01:34:56,000
I have

1944
01:34:56,000 --> 01:34:58,000
a smurf skin

1945
01:34:58,000 --> 01:35:00,000
that's the

1946
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:09,000
I just don't want to hear so much about that

1947
01:35:09,000 --> 01:35:11,000
Shhh

1948
01:35:13,000 --> 01:35:15,000
Can I do that?

1949
01:35:17,000 --> 01:35:21,000
I'm facing the person who felt it through the steps

1950
01:35:21,000 --> 01:35:23,000
Shhh

1951
01:35:29,000 --> 01:35:33,000
You can do like

1952
01:35:33,000 --> 01:35:36,000
I don't know if you can hear that though

1953
01:35:45,000 --> 01:35:48,000
I don't hear that that much

1954
01:35:49,000 --> 01:35:51,000
I don't want to rip it, that's the only thing

1955
01:35:51,000 --> 01:35:53,000
I really do not want to rip this

1956
01:35:53,000 --> 01:35:56,000
I need to be gentle because my nails are so sharp

1957
01:35:56,000 --> 01:35:58,000
Oh you can hear it good

1958
01:36:04,000 --> 01:36:06,000
I do not want to rip it

1959
01:36:09,000 --> 01:36:12,000
This is the best hand chemistry knife

1960
01:36:13,000 --> 01:36:15,000
A little bit

1961
01:36:16,000 --> 01:36:18,000
I just only cured my Tango immunity

1962
01:36:18,000 --> 01:36:20,000
You're welcome

1963
01:36:21,000 --> 01:36:24,000
I can't do this, I have to put the light on

1964
01:36:24,000 --> 01:36:26,000
I have to put the light on

1965
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:32,000
Don't be like

1966
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:34,000
No don't look, I'm so bad

1967
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:36,000
Don't look

1968
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:38,000
You're scaring me

1969
01:36:38,000 --> 01:36:40,000
Hey you can really see my ankle

1970
01:36:40,000 --> 01:36:43,000
What the fuck, why does it protrude so much?

1971
01:36:43,000 --> 01:36:45,000
Are you okay?

1972
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:48,000
Why does it protrude so much?

1973
01:36:48,000 --> 01:36:50,000
Does that hurt everyone's ankle?

1974
01:36:53,000 --> 01:36:55,000
That's normal

1975
01:36:55,000 --> 01:36:57,000
It sticks out

1976
01:36:57,000 --> 01:36:59,000
You leave my baby feet on

1977
01:36:59,000 --> 01:37:01,000
I dare you

1978
01:37:01,000 --> 01:37:03,000
It's normal

1979
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:07,000
You're complex with my fucking ankle

1980
01:37:07,000 --> 01:37:09,000
I can't believe it

1981
01:37:09,000 --> 01:37:11,000
I love you

1982
01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:16,000
Where the heck is my

1983
01:37:16,000 --> 01:37:19,000
Oh my fucking toes, did you see them?

1984
01:37:19,000 --> 01:37:22,000
The pedicure isn't off yet

1985
01:37:23,000 --> 01:37:26,000
Did you see my toes? Be honest

1986
01:37:27,000 --> 01:37:30,000
No, you're not supposed to see them

1987
01:37:30,000 --> 01:37:32,000
Where the fuck did that song go?

1988
01:37:32,000 --> 01:37:34,000
Identify yourself right now

1989
01:37:35,000 --> 01:37:37,000
You saw it

1990
01:37:37,000 --> 01:37:41,000
They've still got the pedicure half on half off

1991
01:37:41,000 --> 01:37:43,000
So they don't want to do it

1992
01:37:47,000 --> 01:37:49,000
I can't believe that happened to them

1993
01:37:55,000 --> 01:37:58,000
It's because the pedicure is like half on half off

1994
01:37:58,000 --> 01:38:00,000
Can I even do it if I can?

1995
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:02,000
I have to like straddle the box

1996
01:38:02,000 --> 01:38:04,000
Hold on

1997
01:38:04,000 --> 01:38:06,000
Can I just like

1998
01:38:06,000 --> 01:38:09,000
Let me to approach the podium

1999
01:38:09,000 --> 01:38:11,000
Really

2000
01:38:11,000 --> 01:38:14,000
And before you're like, what are you wearing?

2001
01:38:14,000 --> 01:38:16,000
Damn right

2002
01:38:16,000 --> 01:38:18,000
What's on there?

2003
01:38:27,000 --> 01:38:30,000
I'm having to squat on the box so I don't break it

2004
01:38:30,000 --> 01:38:32,000
I just want you to know

2005
01:38:35,000 --> 01:38:38,000
We're surrounded by diversity

2006
01:38:38,000 --> 01:38:40,000
I said I was a ghost

2007
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:43,000
It shouldn't be a surprise that everything I wear is black

2008
01:38:45,000 --> 01:38:47,000
It smells so good here

2009
01:38:47,000 --> 01:38:49,000
We sailed a bit here

2010
01:38:54,000 --> 01:38:56,000
I can't believe it

2011
01:38:56,000 --> 01:39:00,000
You're a brightly colored cut off and she's actually a ghost

2012
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:02,000
Ghost running is real

2013
01:39:02,000 --> 01:39:04,000
For real

2014
01:39:05,000 --> 01:39:10,000
Are you going to circumvent the eternal darkness?

2015
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:15,000
I bet you're circumventing the larger ones

2016
01:39:16,000 --> 01:39:19,000
Ghost mummy model one

2017
01:39:19,000 --> 01:39:22,000
And a year of course, the like

2018
01:39:22,000 --> 01:39:24,000
If you want one

2019
01:39:26,000 --> 01:39:28,000
I don't know what kind of darkness I'm in

2020
01:39:28,000 --> 01:39:30,000
I don't know

2021
01:39:32,000 --> 01:39:34,000
In six months?

2022
01:39:34,000 --> 01:39:36,000
Wait, what happens in six months?

2023
01:39:36,000 --> 01:39:38,000
I'm pregnant?

2024
01:39:39,000 --> 01:39:42,000
You're to impregnate me in October

2025
01:39:46,000 --> 01:39:49,000
Cutting fish are excellent at changing color

2026
01:39:49,000 --> 01:39:52,000
The black is just because dark clothing is black

2027
01:39:53,000 --> 01:39:56,000
I wonder if she's going to go as brightly colored as she is

2028
01:39:57,000 --> 01:39:59,000
I'm going to get like a red

2029
01:39:59,000 --> 01:40:02,000
I get a red face when I'm recording

2030
01:40:02,000 --> 01:40:04,000
Which way?

2031
01:40:07,000 --> 01:40:10,000
Pregnancy stream one

2032
01:40:10,000 --> 01:40:14,000
Do you want me to buy a fake pregnancy family?

2033
01:40:14,000 --> 01:40:16,000
Because you know I'm crazy enough to do it

2034
01:40:18,000 --> 01:40:21,000
Of course the ghost scots are my one and only weakness

2035
01:40:21,000 --> 01:40:23,000
That's kind of me

2036
01:40:23,000 --> 01:40:26,000
Imagine having a ghost

2037
01:40:26,000 --> 01:40:29,000
Scotland and a smile

2038
01:40:29,000 --> 01:40:31,000
Wouldn't that be crazy?

2039
01:40:31,000 --> 01:40:33,000
Wow

2040
01:40:33,000 --> 01:40:37,000
Do it? You want me to buy a fucking Pregel Bailey?

2041
01:40:40,000 --> 01:40:43,000
Just stop some pillows on today

2042
01:40:43,000 --> 01:40:45,000
Ask a lot

2043
01:40:45,000 --> 01:40:47,000
I'd say do it if it's under 300 bucks

2044
01:40:47,000 --> 01:40:51,000
I'll go look up fake pregnancy coming

2045
01:40:52,000 --> 01:40:55,000
Put it on through and I'll add it

2046
01:40:59,000 --> 01:41:03,000
It doesn't use through and gets loads of figurines bought for her

2047
01:41:03,000 --> 01:41:05,000
Lego bought for her

2048
01:41:10,000 --> 01:41:14,000
Make sure you get one that for someone twice you're fine

2049
01:41:14,000 --> 01:41:17,000
I don't know if that means too much

2050
01:41:18,000 --> 01:41:22,000
Imagine buying the Bailey and having to explain to the experts

2051
01:41:22,000 --> 01:41:25,000
Some things that don't claim for tax deduction

2052
01:41:25,000 --> 01:41:28,000
Because it's just so, like, ridiculous

2053
01:41:28,000 --> 01:41:31,000
That I don't do it, I know I should but

2054
01:41:38,000 --> 01:41:41,000
We've got to do an ultrasound ASMR

2055
01:41:41,000 --> 01:41:44,000
To see if the babies are healthy

2056
01:41:47,000 --> 01:41:49,000
Okay

2057
01:41:53,000 --> 01:41:55,000
Just need the pillow

2058
01:41:55,000 --> 01:41:57,000
See if there's anything

2059
01:41:59,000 --> 01:42:01,000
See, I can't do it

2060
01:42:01,000 --> 01:42:03,000
I'll leave it back

2061
01:42:03,000 --> 01:42:06,000
Sorry, I just peaked the audio

2062
01:42:06,000 --> 01:42:09,000
Yeah, I can't think to figure out how to do that

2063
01:42:09,000 --> 01:42:11,000
Bye bye

2064
01:42:13,000 --> 01:42:16,000
This is probably the best thing to do in the world

2065
01:42:18,000 --> 01:42:20,000
What's peaking in my mouth?

2066
01:42:23,000 --> 01:42:25,000
This is the best I can do

2067
01:42:25,000 --> 01:42:27,000
I ain't not broke

2068
01:42:30,000 --> 01:42:33,000
Praying to meet me if I know what

2069
01:42:33,000 --> 01:42:35,000
No, no, no, no, no, no

2070
01:42:36,000 --> 01:42:39,000
Did you? No, if I do, if you know what to do

2071
01:42:39,000 --> 01:42:42,000
I can't do that anymore

2072
01:42:42,000 --> 01:42:44,000
No, you can't keep up

2073
01:42:45,000 --> 01:42:48,000
Well, I'm definitely peaking in my mouth

2074
01:42:56,000 --> 01:42:59,000
Bye bye crushing

2075
01:43:02,000 --> 01:43:05,000
No, maybe we shouldn't get the shit treated in the tax

2076
01:43:08,000 --> 01:43:11,000
So I'm gonna say that I could do anything with my hands

2077
01:43:11,000 --> 01:43:13,000
We'd end up getting

2078
01:43:15,000 --> 01:43:17,000
We'd end up getting

2079
01:43:18,000 --> 01:43:21,000
Just because I make gentle gestures with my hands

2080
01:43:25,000 --> 01:43:27,000
I've not trained you that much

2081
01:43:32,000 --> 01:43:34,000
Are you that trained?

2082
01:43:35,000 --> 01:43:41,000
I'm not doing like repetitive sort of gentle moves

2083
01:43:41,000 --> 01:43:43,000
This is enough

2084
01:43:44,000 --> 01:43:47,000
Like, what do you imagine it again?

2085
01:43:47,000 --> 01:43:49,000
What's that clicky thing?

2086
01:43:49,000 --> 01:43:51,000
What's that clicky thing?

2087
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:02,000
What are you looking at?

2088
01:44:04,000 --> 01:44:06,000
What are you looking at?

2089
01:44:09,000 --> 01:44:11,000
Some of us are usually gentle

2090
01:44:12,000 --> 01:44:15,000
She says I should gently squeeze with the key

2091
01:44:15,000 --> 01:44:18,000
I mean, I can grip harder if you want

2092
01:44:19,000 --> 01:44:22,000
Do you deserve me being nice to you?

2093
01:44:25,000 --> 01:44:27,000
That's the thing

2094
01:44:34,000 --> 01:44:37,000
No, no, no, just go play hide and seek with me

2095
01:44:37,000 --> 01:44:40,000
We're doing real ASMR, by the way

2096
01:44:40,000 --> 01:44:42,000
It's so real

2097
01:44:43,000 --> 01:44:45,000
Can't play with me, it's so real

2098
01:44:48,000 --> 01:44:50,000
Need a cold shower

2099
01:44:55,000 --> 01:44:57,000
Please be nice when we kip with your hands

2100
01:44:57,000 --> 01:44:59,000
Like a fence kip with a fence

2101
01:45:00,000 --> 01:45:02,000
Do I deserve it if you want me to be mean?

2102
01:45:02,000 --> 01:45:04,000
I don't know

2103
01:45:06,000 --> 01:45:08,000
This is a pre-recorded stream

2104
01:45:26,000 --> 01:45:28,000
I can also do this

2105
01:45:29,000 --> 01:45:32,000
Looks like these plastic wrappers that are on me

2106
01:45:33,000 --> 01:45:35,000
Just run

2107
01:45:35,000 --> 01:45:37,000
I feel like my hair is like super new

2108
01:45:37,000 --> 01:45:39,000
What?

2109
01:45:40,000 --> 01:45:42,000
Real ASMR?

2110
01:45:42,000 --> 01:45:44,000
Not possible

2111
01:45:45,000 --> 01:45:48,000
I'm like capable of yapping and getting to me

2112
01:45:50,000 --> 01:45:52,000
It's pre-recorded just nice

2113
01:45:52,000 --> 01:45:54,000
That's what I should do

2114
01:45:58,000 --> 01:46:00,000
I don't know

2115
01:46:04,000 --> 01:46:06,000
Holy shit

2116
01:46:06,000 --> 01:46:09,000
Ma, thank you for the 50 gifted memberships

2117
01:46:09,000 --> 01:46:11,000
Holy fucking shit

2118
01:46:12,000 --> 01:46:14,000
I love you so much

2119
01:46:14,000 --> 01:46:16,000
Thank you

2120
01:46:16,000 --> 01:46:18,000
Congrats to those who caught up with your thing

2121
01:46:21,000 --> 01:46:23,000
Can you feel a little tingle there?

2122
01:46:24,000 --> 01:46:26,000
I'll tickle

2123
01:46:29,000 --> 01:46:31,000
And

2124
01:46:32,000 --> 01:46:35,000
Thank you again for the 50 gifted memberships

2125
01:46:37,000 --> 01:46:39,000
There

2126
01:46:40,000 --> 01:46:43,000
Because the thing is that the thing

2127
01:46:44,000 --> 01:46:46,000
squeezes through

2128
01:46:53,000 --> 01:46:55,000
That guy again

2129
01:47:06,000 --> 01:47:08,000
I have a master of touching

2130
01:47:11,000 --> 01:47:13,000
Can you do the ace of tapping?

2131
01:47:13,000 --> 01:47:15,000
Yeah, this is just the last

2132
01:47:19,000 --> 01:47:21,000
I like to imagine

2133
01:47:21,000 --> 01:47:23,000
It's your tool

2134
01:47:31,000 --> 01:47:33,000
And I'm just gently clawing

2135
01:47:37,000 --> 01:47:40,000
You should do ASMR every time

2136
01:47:40,000 --> 01:47:43,000
Yeah, you will do ASMR every single day

2137
01:47:44,000 --> 01:47:46,000
And I just

2138
01:47:46,000 --> 01:47:48,000
Never do anything

2139
01:47:48,000 --> 01:47:51,000
Well, never play with the key

2140
01:47:51,000 --> 01:47:53,000
It's nice to lose by the way

2141
01:47:53,000 --> 01:47:55,000
Thank you

2142
01:47:56,000 --> 01:47:58,000
Bullnature

2143
01:47:58,000 --> 01:48:02,000
You want to put some cookin' oil on the glass?

2144
01:48:03,000 --> 01:48:05,000
Could maybe do that

2145
01:48:05,000 --> 01:48:07,000
Yeah, I like that

2146
01:48:07,000 --> 01:48:09,000
I like that

2147
01:48:09,000 --> 01:48:11,000
I do ASMR

2148
01:48:11,000 --> 01:48:13,000
Tickle

2149
01:48:16,000 --> 01:48:19,000
I'm afraid we've opened our coats away

2150
01:48:24,000 --> 01:48:26,000
Peek and shells

2151
01:48:26,000 --> 01:48:28,000
What's a peek and shell?

2152
01:48:31,000 --> 01:48:33,000
Could you say Billy or something?

2153
01:48:33,000 --> 01:48:35,000
Bullur

2154
01:48:38,000 --> 01:48:40,000
Billy, you're such a Billy

2155
01:48:41,000 --> 01:48:43,000
Or do you like when a Billy you?

2156
01:48:44,000 --> 01:48:47,000
An annoy you, tangle you

2157
01:48:48,000 --> 01:48:50,000
Such a Billy

2158
01:48:53,000 --> 01:48:55,000
Some shells of a peek in that

2159
01:48:55,000 --> 01:48:57,000
Oh, okay

2160
01:49:00,000 --> 01:49:04,000
Your Billy likes seeing you tangle ASMR

2161
01:49:05,000 --> 01:49:08,000
I like seeing the faces in you

2162
01:49:09,000 --> 01:49:12,000
I like seeing your inability to talk

2163
01:49:12,000 --> 01:49:14,000
You just look at me with your eye

2164
01:49:15,000 --> 01:49:18,000
And you get so embarrassed to close them

2165
01:49:18,000 --> 01:49:21,000
As if that's gonna stop you

2166
01:49:21,000 --> 01:49:24,000
From continuing on to doing ASMR

2167
01:49:26,000 --> 01:49:28,000
And a bit of a Billy

2168
01:49:29,000 --> 01:49:32,000
Only because it's here, you know

2169
01:49:39,000 --> 01:49:41,000
Mm-hmm

2170
01:49:42,000 --> 01:49:45,000
Yeah, you found three

2171
01:49:45,000 --> 01:49:47,000
That's good

2172
01:49:50,000 --> 01:49:53,000
You peek and sound for a little bit more

2173
01:49:53,000 --> 01:49:55,000
That's okay

2174
01:49:56,000 --> 01:49:58,000
Thank you

2175
01:49:59,000 --> 01:50:01,000
Yeah

2176
01:50:02,000 --> 01:50:04,000
You peek in front of my eye contact phone

2177
01:50:04,000 --> 01:50:07,000
To real, that's the best part

2178
01:50:07,000 --> 01:50:09,000
But then

2179
01:50:09,000 --> 01:50:12,000
I'd get you to sit down in the chair

2180
01:50:12,000 --> 01:50:16,000
And I'd have all the tools laid out

2181
01:50:18,000 --> 01:50:20,000
And I'd just start gently

2182
01:50:20,000 --> 01:50:23,000
Maybe over your head here

2183
01:50:23,000 --> 01:50:26,000
Crouch your scalp

2184
01:50:30,000 --> 01:50:32,000
And then

2185
01:50:32,000 --> 01:50:36,000
It just watches your expression changes

2186
01:50:38,000 --> 01:50:40,000
A little lower again

2187
01:50:40,000 --> 01:50:42,000
I'm a little past right here

2188
01:50:42,000 --> 01:50:44,000
Bring there

2189
01:50:49,000 --> 01:50:52,000
And each time

2190
01:50:52,000 --> 01:50:55,000
Just keep talking

2191
01:50:55,000 --> 01:50:58,000
But I didn't notice their emotion

2192
01:51:00,000 --> 01:51:03,000
And it would just spur me on

2193
01:51:03,000 --> 01:51:06,000
To go further and further

2194
01:51:08,000 --> 01:51:12,000
And you'd hear it in my voice

2195
01:51:14,000 --> 01:51:17,000
About how happy I am

2196
01:51:24,000 --> 01:51:26,000
So you'd be like me to it

2197
01:51:26,000 --> 01:51:29,000
Even though your body's screaming at you

2198
01:51:29,000 --> 01:51:31,000
Why are you doing that?

2199
01:51:32,000 --> 01:51:35,000
You're crazy

2200
01:51:36,000 --> 01:51:39,000
Don't lie to me

2201
01:51:50,000 --> 01:51:53,000
I think that's how I would believe you

2202
01:51:53,000 --> 01:51:56,000
A little reason?

2203
01:51:56,000 --> 01:51:59,000
I don't want to believe you like that

2204
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:03,000
We're all speechless right now

2205
01:52:06,000 --> 01:52:09,000
These are called ace globes

2206
01:52:25,000 --> 01:52:28,000
I'm not mean to you

2207
01:52:30,000 --> 01:52:35,000
I wouldn't do anything to you that you couldn't handle

2208
01:52:37,000 --> 01:52:42,000
You like that I push your limits

2209
01:52:45,000 --> 01:52:49,000
You like that I push your boundaries

2210
01:52:54,000 --> 01:52:58,000
You like every little thing I do for you

2211
01:53:00,000 --> 01:53:03,000
That is why

2212
01:53:04,000 --> 01:53:06,000
You'll let me

2213
01:53:17,000 --> 01:53:23,000
You really let a five foot three skull defeat you

2214
01:53:23,000 --> 01:53:25,000
Well

2215
01:53:27,000 --> 01:53:30,000
The incapacitated

2216
01:53:30,000 --> 01:53:33,000
You can't think for yourself

2217
01:53:34,000 --> 01:53:36,000
Just gonna let you do

2218
01:53:41,000 --> 01:53:43,000
Don't believe too hard

2219
01:53:43,000 --> 01:53:47,000
Why? What happens if I believe too hard?

2220
01:53:48,000 --> 01:53:52,000
Are you gonna be doing something embarrassing?

2221
01:53:54,000 --> 01:53:57,000
Have fun with it when you're done

2222
01:54:06,000 --> 01:54:09,000
I'll go back to scratching your back

2223
01:54:15,000 --> 01:54:18,000
I just get used to the nails

2224
01:54:18,000 --> 01:54:22,000
The first thing that's a little sore but it feels good after

2225
01:54:23,000 --> 01:54:26,000
You'll like to enjoy it

2226
01:54:26,000 --> 01:54:28,000
Shhh

2227
01:54:28,000 --> 01:54:30,000
Shhh

2228
01:54:52,000 --> 01:54:56,000
So it's paid back for yesterday and maybe

2229
01:54:59,000 --> 01:55:07,000
The tongue did some glitching as cause I'm so far away from the little thing

2230
01:55:07,000 --> 01:55:10,000
You're like all the way over there

2231
01:55:10,000 --> 01:55:12,000
Shhh

2232
01:55:26,000 --> 01:55:28,000
Do your worst

2233
01:55:28,000 --> 01:55:30,000
Shhh

2234
01:55:38,000 --> 01:55:41,000
Should I bring you down again?

2235
01:55:41,000 --> 01:55:44,000
When can I bring you back down?

2236
01:55:44,000 --> 01:55:48,000
It's paying for you to relax

2237
01:55:48,000 --> 01:55:50,000
Do you understand?

2238
01:55:50,000 --> 01:55:53,000
We need to do a real ASMR

2239
01:55:53,000 --> 01:55:55,000
To wrap it

2240
01:55:55,000 --> 01:55:57,000
What are we about to do?

2241
01:55:57,000 --> 01:56:00,000
Your nicotine patch? Put it back on quick

2242
01:56:06,000 --> 01:56:09,000
Okay, time to get you nice and relaxed again

2243
01:56:20,000 --> 01:56:23,000
Is that a foodie doll?

2244
01:56:23,000 --> 01:56:25,000
It's a carrot snack

2245
01:56:25,000 --> 01:56:27,000
But I don't do it

2246
01:56:27,000 --> 01:56:29,000
I know I believe in it too

2247
01:56:29,000 --> 01:56:32,000
It's just a very good atonement of corrective

2248
01:56:32,000 --> 01:56:36,000
Can I do it at some time?

2249
01:56:36,000 --> 01:56:39,000
Are you all ready for this?

2250
01:56:39,000 --> 01:56:42,000
Oh, I've coordinated enough

2251
01:56:42,000 --> 01:56:45,000
There you go

2252
01:56:51,000 --> 01:56:54,000
There you go

2253
01:56:58,000 --> 01:57:00,000
Even the doll has a bug

2254
01:57:04,000 --> 01:57:07,000
Are you ready to eat it?

2255
01:57:12,000 --> 01:57:15,000
Did the doll even have ears?

2256
01:57:15,000 --> 01:57:18,000
No, it didn't.

2257
01:57:24,000 --> 01:57:27,000
Well, they're transfer tingles.

2258
01:57:27,000 --> 01:57:30,000
Tattattattattattata

2259
01:57:30,000 --> 01:57:35,000
in the cat room

2260
01:57:39,000 --> 01:57:43,000
and then we're gonna bubble run your head

2261
01:57:49,000 --> 01:57:53,000
Let me run you in

2262
01:57:53,000 --> 01:57:57,000
I'm sorry for getting it

2263
01:58:05,000 --> 01:58:07,000
Can you confirm if there's a bullet or not?

2264
01:58:07,000 --> 01:58:09,000
You can see it over here

2265
01:58:09,000 --> 01:58:13,000
I'll give you a quick summary of this

2266
01:58:13,000 --> 01:58:15,000
Can you confirm if there's a bullet or not?

2267
01:58:15,000 --> 01:58:17,000
You can see it over here

2268
01:58:23,000 --> 01:58:25,000
Okay

2269
01:58:32,000 --> 01:58:34,000
Now you're gonna call me

2270
01:58:37,000 --> 01:58:39,000
It's okay, you don't have anything with that

2271
01:58:39,000 --> 01:58:41,000
I'm still gonna call you

2272
01:58:41,000 --> 01:58:43,000
Get me with you guys

2273
01:58:45,000 --> 01:58:47,000
I'm gonna call you

2274
01:58:53,000 --> 01:58:55,000
Okay

2275
01:58:59,000 --> 01:59:05,000
Now, unfortunately the mannequin's head's a little bit too small for the head

2276
01:59:05,000 --> 01:59:07,000
I'm not sure it's gonna work

2277
01:59:09,000 --> 01:59:11,000
It's a bit big

2278
01:59:14,000 --> 01:59:16,000
I'm gonna pull it to the side

2279
01:59:16,000 --> 01:59:20,000
Because I can pull off the head

2280
01:59:20,000 --> 01:59:22,000
What?

2281
01:59:26,000 --> 01:59:28,000
It's still a little bit too big

2282
01:59:28,000 --> 01:59:30,000
Can we hear again this part?

2283
01:59:32,000 --> 01:59:35,000
Yeah, if she doesn't get scared

2284
01:59:35,000 --> 01:59:38,000
She gets scared and she runs from here

2285
01:59:45,000 --> 01:59:47,000
There's no one

2286
01:59:47,000 --> 01:59:50,000
I'm gonna make sure she doesn't get scared

2287
01:59:50,000 --> 01:59:53,000
I'm gonna make sure she doesn't get scared

2288
02:00:00,000 --> 02:00:02,000
Can you tell me if there's an issue with her?

2289
02:00:02,000 --> 02:00:05,000
Why is there a need on the mannequin?

2290
02:00:07,000 --> 02:00:11,000
I'm gonna continue to face the mannequin

2291
02:00:11,000 --> 02:00:13,000
I'm gonna make sure she doesn't get scared

2292
02:00:17,000 --> 02:00:19,000
She looks in the room all the time

2293
02:00:19,000 --> 02:00:21,000
Which means

2294
02:00:22,000 --> 02:00:24,000
Yes, I'm still gonna remember

2295
02:00:24,000 --> 02:00:26,000
Just from now on

2296
02:00:28,000 --> 02:00:31,000
Can you tell me if there's an issue with her?

2297
02:00:31,000 --> 02:00:33,000
Is she still going?

2298
02:00:33,000 --> 02:00:35,000
Can you direct her to her?

2299
02:00:42,000 --> 02:00:44,000
Hello

2300
02:00:56,000 --> 02:00:58,000
I'm gonna redirect

2301
02:01:00,000 --> 02:01:03,000
Into a genuine kind

2302
02:01:06,000 --> 02:01:08,000
She's not doing anything else

2303
02:01:08,000 --> 02:01:10,000
She must be on her phone

2304
02:01:19,000 --> 02:01:21,000
I'm doing Twitter?

2305
02:01:21,000 --> 02:01:23,000
What's on Twitter?

2306
02:01:24,000 --> 02:01:26,000
Don't leave us, I'm not leaving

2307
02:01:26,000 --> 02:01:28,000
I've got more days to work and work

2308
02:01:34,000 --> 02:01:36,000
I don't know anything

2309
02:01:36,000 --> 02:01:38,000
There's more content

2310
02:01:40,000 --> 02:01:42,000
I don't know what you're into

2311
02:01:47,000 --> 02:01:49,000
Are you aware of these earmuffs?

2312
02:01:49,000 --> 02:01:51,000
No, I don't know, I don't read them

2313
02:01:52,000 --> 02:01:55,000
I have hair that goes over my ear

2314
02:01:55,000 --> 02:01:57,000
Oh, real bad

2315
02:01:57,000 --> 02:01:59,000
Sorry

2316
02:02:03,000 --> 02:02:06,000
Are we getting so barely hit sometimes?

2317
02:02:06,000 --> 02:02:08,000
Is this preparation?

2318
02:02:08,000 --> 02:02:10,000
I don't know

2319
02:02:11,000 --> 02:02:14,000
Is it preferential for tomorrow?

2320
02:02:15,000 --> 02:02:17,000
I'm not sure

2321
02:02:18,000 --> 02:02:21,000
I mean, good one will be a puppy

2322
02:02:22,000 --> 02:02:24,000
Okay

2323
02:02:24,000 --> 02:02:26,000
I don't know

2324
02:02:26,000 --> 02:02:29,000
You don't want to be my little puppy?

2325
02:02:30,000 --> 02:02:32,000
Can you look after me?

2326
02:02:33,000 --> 02:02:35,000
Give to me

2327
02:02:35,000 --> 02:02:38,000
You're getting lots of scratches

2328
02:02:41,000 --> 02:02:44,000
You're gonna be all mine

2329
02:02:52,000 --> 02:02:54,000
No

2330
02:02:59,000 --> 02:03:01,000
Okay

2331
02:03:01,000 --> 02:03:04,000
I'm gonna redirect you to shoes

2332
02:03:04,000 --> 02:03:06,000
I'm gonna have a membership room

2333
02:03:06,000 --> 02:03:09,000
If you give me five minutes, I'll make a copy

2334
02:03:10,000 --> 02:03:14,000
And then I will continue with some health care for you tomorrow

2335
02:03:14,000 --> 02:03:18,000
Where we look at some kind of health care

2336
02:03:21,000 --> 02:03:24,000
Let me think about if you hit me too

2337
02:03:29,000 --> 02:03:31,000
Thank you very much

2338
02:03:31,000 --> 02:03:35,000
Thank you, I'm glad I managed to focus the ones that I actually do, isn't it?

2339
02:03:37,000 --> 02:03:39,000
Love the stream

2340
02:03:39,000 --> 02:03:43,000
But I make sure I have to get my nails done, don't I?

2341
02:03:43,000 --> 02:03:46,000
Get my nails done, my nails cut off

2342
02:03:47,000 --> 02:03:50,000
And then I have to get my nails done

2343
02:03:55,000 --> 02:03:58,000
Okay, let me go redirect you to shoes

2344
02:03:59,000 --> 02:04:03,000
And as a special treat, you get feet cupping

2345
02:04:12,000 --> 02:04:14,000
Next, the nail color

2346
02:04:15,000 --> 02:04:18,000
I don't have a nail color yet

2347
02:04:18,000 --> 02:04:20,000
Let me do it for you

2348
02:04:25,000 --> 02:04:28,000
Enjoy some MLTG on your feet

2349
02:04:29,000 --> 02:04:31,000
Did you just see my face?

2350
02:04:34,000 --> 02:04:37,000
I feel like I'm back to the corner

2351
02:04:38,000 --> 02:04:40,000
Please ignore the shaping

2352
02:04:40,000 --> 02:04:43,000
The webcam is attached to the TV

2353
02:04:43,000 --> 02:04:45,000
To the desk

2354
02:04:49,000 --> 02:04:51,000
If you just give me five minutes

2355
02:04:51,000 --> 02:04:54,000
I will start off the membership room

2356
02:04:54,000 --> 02:04:57,000
So I'm just gonna redirect you to my genie

2357
02:04:58,000 --> 02:05:00,000
But as I've learned

2358
02:05:01,000 --> 02:05:03,000
She is a baby now

2359
02:05:03,000 --> 02:05:05,000
So turn your volume down

2360
02:05:05,000 --> 02:05:07,000
Are you pumping the table? No!

2361
02:05:07,000 --> 02:05:09,000
I'm clicking on it

2362
02:05:11,000 --> 02:05:13,000
I'll see you in five minutes

2363
02:05:13,000 --> 02:05:15,000
Thank everyone who likes and subscribes

2364
02:05:15,000 --> 02:05:18,000
And laughs again for the rest of the membership

2365
02:05:18,000 --> 02:05:20,000
Hope I didn't offend them

2366
02:05:20,000 --> 02:05:22,000
Thank you so much

2367
02:05:22,000 --> 02:05:24,000
I'll see you tomorrow

2368
02:05:24,000 --> 02:05:25,000
For more ASMR

2369
02:05:25,000 --> 02:05:27,000
And maybe there's more hunt

2370
02:05:27,000 --> 02:05:29,000
Count streams on the way

2371
02:05:31,000 --> 02:05:32,000
See you shortly

2372
02:05:33,000 --> 02:05:35,000
Bye
