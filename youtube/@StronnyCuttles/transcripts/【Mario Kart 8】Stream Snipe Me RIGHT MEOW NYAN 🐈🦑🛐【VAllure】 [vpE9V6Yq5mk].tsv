2093760	2098140	Oh my god, you ruined my whole day. How dare you. Okay. Okay. Bring it back. Bring it back. Bring the tension.
2098480	2104720	Raise the tension. Raise the tension. Any tension. How you just literally took my little boost thing.
2104800	2108920	That could have been make or break. And what do you, how do I get repeat?
2109880	2111880	Up my arse. Honestly.
2112520	2116240	Honestly. This is strong. What are you, oh my god.
2118640	2122800	Okay, this is why I need to copy the reflins because you guys have actually played this game before.
2123040	2128080	What? We're literally sidewall drifting. Can I get the, the, the, the, no!
2129920	2131920	You took my eye arm!
2133600	2141600	Refling! Whoever did the lightning bolt, I'm actually sleep paralysis and I'm 12th place! No!
2143600	2148960	At Fanun Mama. Shame I can't join the race myself since I don't have Mario Kart.
2148960	2152320	I didn't. But I'm wholly content watching you tear up the track.
2152880	2157040	You've got this. Tear up the track? Are you kidding me? This is so bad.
2158160	2162560	Why did I pick this game for a street sniping purpose? This is so bad.
2171360	2177920	Right, let's do ace, ace outpost. Thank you, K-Dawn. K-Dawn, I'm saying it wrong.
2177920	2180480	After you mommy, shame you can't join because of the Mario Kart.
2180480	2185760	Don't buy it is my advice. It's fucking shite. It's so hard to play. It's not shite. It's just I'm shite.
2186480	2192560	But I'm wholly content watching you tear up the track. Why are you hyping me up over lie?
2194560	2200480	Why are you telling fibbers? You know, for a factory fling, I'm not tear it. The only thing I'm tearing
2200480	2205280	is your freaking back door trying to get to that bros day. I'm sucking it. It's so bad like.
2205840	2212400	Brov. How the a- Like, I'm not being funny. How is this not just like Mario Kart from DS?
2212400	2217280	Why is this something else? What do you mean they have to keep evolving games in order to
2217280	2226720	make them worthy of freaking selling? Like, Brov. I'm losing it. I think she needs the auto-steering.
2226720	2230960	I do too. I'm not being funny, but I actually do. Like, I'm forgetting to steer.
2231680	2237840	Okay. Right. I'm going to try hard, even though I've never played this freaking track before and
2237840	2249280	I have no idea what's up ahead. Okay. Okay. Right. I've got a speedboot. Who's picked this map?
2250800	2257360	Oh my god. Someone just went off the map. Oh no. That's a bit dangerous for me. I'm going to be
2257360	2261680	honest. I didn't know I had to turn. I didn't know I had to turn. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
2262480	2269600	Have I gone somewhere? I shouldn't be. I mean, would they code it in? Okay. Okay. Okay. Him with
2269600	2277440	him with him. Hey. I'm trying hard. And I suck, even when I try hard. How is this possible? Be
2277440	2283360	honest. Have you guys all played this game? Is this like a super popular game? I know that sounds
2283440	2292720	so weird. Like, I'm sure it sounds weird to say it loud, but like, I just, I just, I fucking suck.
2292720	2299280	I suck so badly. Like, I don't, I don't remember ever sucking so badly in a game before.
2300880	2304640	Like normally like, oh, I get the hang of it. I comprehend what I'm supposed to do.
2305360	2307360	This is just annihilation.
2312720	2316320	Oh my god. That's funny. Sorry. That's actually funny.
2317360	2320080	You've cheered me up because you're letting me in your prostate. I love you here.
2322080	2325360	I might be the one getting annihilated, but no, it's time for you to bend over.
2328080	2330480	I'm literally not mad anymore because I'm getting prostate.
2330480	2339280	I suck. That is foul. Stop it. You shouldn't encourage me. Thank you, Kai, down to the super chat.
2340000	2347440	That is terrible. Right. Oh, I'm going to let all steer. I'm literally, how can you do that if I'm
2347440	2355360	spamming down the track? Sauce, but yous are cheating. Stop. I'm doing so well. And you keep
2355440	2362240	putting your banana on the track. How am I 12th place again? I was literally 8th place like a
2362240	2370880	moment ago. Oh my god. I don't even know if I'm going to make it. I need like a special, I literally
2370880	2380880	did not finish. I know that. Fucking all I'm getting is one freaking point. This isn't even possible.
2381760	2386560	When will you fricks learn? When you fricking fricks learn? Your ex is just complicated.
2388080	2394160	Skill issue. It literally is a skill issue. It needs to lock back in, bro. The only lock
2394160	2399120	I'm doing is putting one on your pee pee because I'm getting the disrespect I'm experiencing.
2400160	2406160	I'm just picking maps at random. I thought you were a gamer. Oh, that comment always comes up.
2406880	2412240	You're first to be R worded. That comment always comes up. I know you try to wind me up and it's
2412240	2418640	working. That comment always comes up. Oh, you've played games before. So you're not MLG in every
2418640	2427280	single game you ever play. You're first. Do you hear me? You are first. Oh, I hate this. I hate it.
2427280	2433200	Right, let's go. Yoshi Valley. Oh, fuck you. I'm done.
2434880	2442160	Right. This is impossible. I need, literally, I need to steer assist on because I'm so bad.
2443200	2449280	And then everyone's gonna hate. Maybe I'll have, right, go. Now that's when I put on.
2451520	2456560	Bro, so I put on a saying too late and then I'm too late and then I put on a saying too early
2456560	2464000	and I'm saying too early. Why is everyone going this way? Wait, what kind of track is this?
2464960	2469600	You can go multiple ways. Okay, hold on. Sorry, but the developer's kind of cool.
2470480	2475600	That actually doesn't seem like that bad of an idea. Like it seems really fun and different.
2476480	2484640	I'm kind of here for it. Hold on. Right, go. Oh no, everything's bendy though. I don't have
2484640	2491600	like a straight. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Come on. Let me try hard. Like for
2491600	2498880	one map, let me try. Why is there a random egg in the middle of the map? Stop flamethrowering.
2500240	2504400	That's it. No fire v-tubers. Fire v-tubers banned for Gen 2. I'm not having it.
2506400	2510720	What do you mean? Emmy technically can control fire. Yes, but that's because of the book. Okay,
2510800	2513680	it's all about the book. Wait, Emmy, be nice to her. Okay, she tries her best.
2514320	2517520	Right, fuck it. I'm going the right side. So I was, I'm going the right side. All right.
2518960	2525280	Okay, OOM said go underneath. What? This is actually really creative. Sorry, but they
2525280	2529520	actually did really well. Yeah, that's right. That's what you get with your green freaking thing.
2529520	2535280	It's my way, ya bobag, honestly. Wait, hold on, hold on, hold on.
2535440	2543520	Oh my God. Oh my God. Right, sorry, I can't. I need OOM to just kick in. Please, OOM. I can't
2543520	2550080	believe I need a freaking child's game to OOM me in the right direction. Get out. No way,
2550080	2559600	that just happened. Yeah, like, oh my God. Stop. There's ink and I'm getting tipped over. I literally
2559600	2569120	can't even drive. Did you just do that for, I swear that was targeted. I swear that was targeted
2569120	2575600	and that rifling legit was like, like, oh, there's mummy, I'm going for it. I swear that was, am I
2575600	2583040	going crazy? That was targeted. What was the name? I'm actually coming to your house right now and
2583040	2589440	getting your address. I'm writing it down. That is outrageous behaviour. I stream every single day.
2589440	2594640	I have so much fun. I do all these free audios and this is what I freaking get. This is what I get.
2595920	2602080	I fart in the wind. No, out my way right now. Out my way right now. No. Hey, it's dropping bombs!
2602080	2612800	I was fourth place. Oh, I'm tenth again. Whoever dropped that bomb, fucking, your mom's a hoe.
2612800	2616800	So as she actually was like, she can't even close them. Oh my God, I'm ninth place. I'll take it,
2616800	2621040	right? That was a good attempt. I'm ninth place. I got eight points. I got nine, I got four points
2621040	2629600	for that. So now I'm still second place. Oh yeah. After all that hard working effort, I'm still
2629600	2638480	second place. Yippee. You whipped wrong type of ink on my bed. Thank you, Kaidon. Anonymous. How
2638480	2644640	cute. Even mummy can have AC levels of brightness. When she's being a sore loser, head pass for trying.
2645360	2651600	Fucking the thing's like, yeah, nice try. You are second place. Please, you suck. Take your frustrations
2651600	2656480	out on me. Oh, it's already happening. Didn't you think I was snow? Right, we'll need to refresh the lobby
2657040	2663200	and pray that we have some empathetic refunds that'll let me go ahead. You know you're out there.
2668080	2669600	Are you squidding me right now?
2670800	2677040	Lord of storms. Angry Scottish caught fish noises all the bit. Am I actually getting that angry?
2678080	2681120	I don't remember. I don't really recall. Maybe I just like black it. Right,
2681760	2684560	right. We need someone. Can I make a green toad?
2686960	2688960	Why can't I make you green? Go green right now.
2691680	2695680	Why are you blue? Wait, you aren't as fast as the other one?
2696880	2701920	Watching you mold is the best thing ever. I'm actually, I don't know, that your next felt personal.
2701920	2708000	Oops, sorry. Sorry if I scared anyone. I promise I'm having a good time for the most part.

2730560	2737360	Oh my God, we're almost max speed. Wait, who's max speed combo? Someone must have it. Oh my gosh.
2737440	2740800	Right, ID. Kilo to
2742880	2752320	Foxtrot for November. The fats are fast. Oh, that's a little bit of a,
2754080	2758320	is that actually true? Is that the meta in the game that the bigger the person, the
2758320	2763360	bigger they are, like the faster they are? Are you sweating right now?
2763440	2768480	Gamer smack talk is when you know you're having fun. Just your mom's a whole. That's it. That's
2768480	2775200	all I've got going for me. Tydon, I'll offer up myself. If you win this race, I can't win anything.
2775200	2787920	I suck. Kilo to F alpha November. Oh, look at all my replays. Hi replays. One, two, three, four.

2825440	2836880	right. Sin sisters getting the last spot. Kilo to Foxtrot for November. I wonder now,
2836880	2843680	are we about to find out if Sin sisters as bad at this game as me or is she MLG pro? Hmm.
2845360	2850800	Heavier classes are faster than harder to move when rammed, but have slow acceleration.
2852080	2864480	Oh, I should go for acceleration and both shine. Oh, no. It's not going to go well for us. Is that
2864480	2870880	one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11. Is she correct? We'll see. They are
2870880	2876800	going to fight for that 12th place. Stop. I think we may actually be this entire next map is me
2876800	2880800	going to be going, send, send, leave me alone, send, send, go the right, go away.
2884640	2890560	This is a members only thing. Yeah. Anyone can join, but since coming in, you're not sin.
2890560	2898560	What the fuck are you? Who the fuck are you? That's not sin. Is that you and your, that can't
2898560	2905280	be your sin. That's not sin. There's no way. That's, is that your dad or something? What the
2905280	2917200	fuck? Is that your dad's me? Right. Well, wait for her to type, but if someone's, no, I'm no,
2917200	2923200	in your cheeky. Right. Is anyone, does anyone feel like sacrificing themselves so Sin can come
2923200	2927600	into this lobby? We flings and shows all we, but can I kindly request that?
2929440	2934480	Is anyone willing to sacrifice? There's, I need, I'll join next round. It's okay. Oh,
2934480	2939680	no, no, no, there, there, there, look, look, look, look, look. The reflins are popping off. Come on,
2939680	2944960	send, come on, come on, get in this fucking game. So at least I'm not last place. Surely you'll be
2945920	2954400	last place. If I was in there, thank you reflings. Right, let's see Sin come in. Do you look like
2956800	2960400	Is that you? Oh my God. Why are you so pretty? Is that you?
2964800	2968560	Sin's gonna whopper. Why is your freaking thing so pretty?
2968880	2978880	Okay. If that is you, she's greener. I'm not in. Oh, that's not you. All right. Okay, okay, okay.
2981280	2984160	Oh, wait, wait, is your freaking thing booted up yet?
2987760	2993920	I'm excited. Hold on. How'd that talk again? Let's wait for more players. What a shame.
2994480	2999920	I'm using tilt control. Oh, I'm already tilted. So you don't need to tell me.
3001200	3005520	I'll get you next time. Literally need to all the reflings unanimously.
3008000	3014640	One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, 11. Yeah, so Sin can get in. Sin's charging her switch.
3016400	3020400	I got asked because I only saw the end of the Ring Fit stream, but you're all good now. Yeah,
3020400	3030080	yeah, no, I passed out. And then that's how my body recovered. Next round, give Sin the code first.
3032000	3033120	What is going on?
3036480	3039680	And before you message me on, I'm in? Who are-
3042160	3043760	I'm in last? Wait, who are you?
3046160	3049040	One. That's you?
3050400	3056320	Are you the red? I don't know. I picked Bowser. Are you the freaking red guy in the suit?
3057920	3064880	On the right? Oh, did you just pick a random? Wait, press X and talk. Like, go like, goodnight.
3066560	3075120	That must be you. Sin for strong! Okay, that's so cute. Right, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven,
3075200	3079920	eight, nine, ten, 11, 12. Okay, we're ready. We're ready. Right, we know who to beat.
3081200	3087840	We know who to go for. We know who to go for. Let's see if me and the thing is,
3088880	3094240	I'll tell you the story when we play Elden Ring together, but you wouldn't believe it. But me and
3094240	3102240	Sin used to be very, very good gamers on a very specific game. Right, let's say the airport. Speaking
3102240	3105680	of modern warfare, Pop is on the airport terminal map.
3109680	3115280	Why am I Boris Johnson? I didn't even know I'm the one who switched. Honestly.
3117440	3122080	I don't know how VTubers play this game. This game is so hard for no reason.
3125040	3128400	Okay, who's getting the pick? Who's getting the pick?
3128640	3134560	Pinball map? It looks like pinball.
3136240	3139440	Monka. Monka, Monka, Monka, Monka, Monka, Monka.
3141840	3148000	Mumu Meadow is best map? Is that your opinion or is that fact right? Right, so my what? My acceleration
3148000	3155040	is do-do, but my speed is good? I think I've completely messed up this choice. Right, let's connect.
3156000	3162240	I got burned. What? No, you better not.
3165920	3169920	Wait, I thought you said my speed was, like, tall. Are you serious?
3175280	3177200	I thought you said my speed was good.
3177360	3190800	Bro, as if I'm not already debuffed enough. I thought you said my speed was good.
3193440	3201840	I am never picking a heavy again. Oh my god. I love yours, but I don't features any time,
3201840	3210320	but for driving in Mario Kart, this is terrible. Acceleration does not equal speed.
3210320	3217920	So then what with the fricking speed? Oh my god, there's random pinballs bumping in the map as well?
3218960	3225760	No, not now. Stop throwing your flamethrower at me. Go, baby. Right, okay, we're doing the AC
3225760	3232400	method. We're babying it the fuck up. Right, we're doing baby next round, and we're going to get
3232400	3237200	fricking, right, let's go, let's go, let's go. Oh my god, that's messing with my eyes, holy crap.
3239440	3243200	Yeah, I'm so big and clunky.
3246560	3252800	I mean, I'm not dead last, then again, send a disconnect. So I think there's only 11 people
3253600	3258400	in this map right now. Oh, this one's tricky.
3262160	3265040	I like how everyone makes a noise as well in game. Like,
3265040	3279200	like, I'm going to like all the way and do it saying all the way, all the way, all the way,
3279200	3284240	all the way, all the way. I love that all the way. So it's the best thing created in this game.
3284800	3294320	Oh, I love all these wee sounds. I wonder if I could do toad.
3300480	3304640	Oh my god, it's because I put flight mode on by accident. How do you,
3305600	3310800	how does one put on flight mode by accident? I don't even know how to access those panels.
3311440	3317040	Are you serious? I don't know how, oh my god, that slowed me down so much.
3320160	3323760	Oh my god, I've got like a little gear stick thing going on. Hi Wario.
3324720	3330960	That was on purpose. You had plenty of room for the both of us and you chose to do that, Wario.
3330960	3336000	Please don't think I'm not aware of. Right, fuck first place. Whoever, there's a blue shell coming
3336000	3341520	for whoever's in first place and it was Wario. Don't rub it in my face that you got the golden
3341520	3352000	freaking thing. Oh my gosh, Wario, you're so rude. Oh my god, this is so dangerous, this map.
3356960	3360720	As if you get that and I don't get that. Come on, who deserves it more, be honest.
3361680	3366720	Oh, that was rubbish. Somehow I held a button and it popped on. I'm going to great, right? Take
3366720	3370320	this as a warm up because you're all done, so Winston is in the lobby. Oh yeah.
3372800	3378400	Honestly. Wait, was that last place? Wait, did two reeflings just connect? I mean,
3378400	3383200	Sin obviously counts as a reefling. Excellent, excellent, excellent. Wait, let's do Sherbert land.
3383200	3390160	That looks quite easy. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11.
3390800	3397760	Yeah, you were like, wait, why do you have a golden crown on you? Wait, did you win two in a row
3397760	3404480	and now you've got a golden crown to flaunt it? No way. No way, the game is rubbing it in her
3404960	3411920	face. Oh, Cryoniku's most points. Okay, we all spit on him. Got it. I know what to do.
3413760	3419040	Okay, I picked, I already forgot what I picked. Oh, there's the Roman Coliseum.
3420480	3424400	What is this? This course has been, I don't know what it is. What it is.
3426800	3430160	There's a missing person. I wonder who is supposed to be then.
3430160	3443680	Okay, second race. I am never picking a heavy again. Excite, bake. Excite, bake. Excitobico desu.
3443680	3452800	That was terrible. Are we like rally racers? Oh, we can jump off in the air.
3453280	3456400	Okay, I like that.
3459200	3465280	Yeah. Whoa. Oh, there's mud on the track. Oh, we need to be careful not to touch the mud.
3465920	3469840	Don't want my tires to get all sticky now, do I?
3473520	3479040	Okay, well, I just took myself for that. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Let me kick. Let me kick.
3479040	3488480	I'm eighth place. I'll take it. Oh, there's like, nah, you took my, wait. No. Oh my God.
3488480	3494240	Wait, how did you just drift over the mud? I'm sorry, but how did he just drift over the mud?
3495920	3501760	Is that for real? Like for real? For real? How did he do that? Did he cheat? Or am I going crazy?
3501760	3505840	Shake your controller when you do, when you jump to, sorry, I'm not even reading,
3505920	3512080	airplane. Shake your controller when you jump to do a trick and get a mini boost.
3513200	3516960	How did that refling go through the mud? But when I go through the mud,
3516960	3521520	it's like literally a bog. And it's, as if it's not like a two foot puzzle.
3522800	3525440	A two foot puzzle. What the fuck? A two foot puzzle.
3526560	3529200	When you go off a ramp, wait, shake my controller.
3530000	3539520	Oh, wait, how does it know I'm doing that? Oh my God, I'm starting on that. How does it know
3539520	3547840	I'm doing that? That's so cool. Oh, that's so cool. Oh my God, it knows when I shake.
3559280	3563680	Feel the noise. Okay, that didn't work. Oh my God, it knows when I'm shaking.
3563680	3568480	Shake and bake. Oh, oh, it didn't do it that time. That's okay. I forgive it. Shake, shake, shake,
3568480	3575840	shake, shake, shake, shake. Oh, I'm jerking off this controller right now. Oh, that's so fun.
3575840	3580960	Thank you for telling me. I didn't even know you could do that. Oh my God, I ignored the mud.
3582240	3586080	It is chaos. It is chaos back here. It's absolutely chaos.
3587040	3594000	Right, I got eighth or something. I don't know. Oh my God. Shake your controller or press Z.
3594640	3601360	There's no Z. There's no Z. Is it triggers? Be honest. There's a bumper in triggers. You'll have
3601360	3608720	to tell me in Xbox terms. Wish I was Johnny's controller right now. Improvement, eighth place.
3608720	3616320	All I had to do was start doing... Let's do tick tock clock because I have tick tock brain rot.
3617680	3622320	The triggers are ZR. Why on earth would they call them that?
3624320	3626880	I don't think I could have been hit by any more Ioms.
3627600	3630400	Honestly, me every time I go around the map, I'm getting ruled.
3631200	3640960	All you had to do was literally... Lutuber figures out how to win Mario Kart. All she has to do is like
3640960	3644960	fucking... I just spilled cola down myself if you heard me get a napkin. Sorry.
3647440	3653360	Give me coconut mole or give me death. I'll pick coconut mole. Where was it? What are my points?
3653360	3656400	Oh my God, I have seven and I'm still last.
3660080	3662880	This game is far too difficult. I said what I said.
3664000	3671280	Okay, third race. We've got one more and then in comes... I'll have... I don't even have freaking
3671280	3680240	discord open. Right. You guys will let us in and so I don't need to... Oh. Oh, how beautiful.
3681200	3687120	Oh my God, it reminds me of Christmas. Oh wait, can I do tricks in the air? No, I can't. Okay, sorry.
3688640	3692720	Sorry if you hear me like violently shaking in the background. It's because I'm trying to get it working.
3694240	3701040	Please stop bumping into me. Oh, he almost went off the road. I think he may have went off... Oh, it's spin.
3701760	3711520	Whoa, what? How am I not dead? Take that. See, if I use that against someone, it's funny,
3711520	3718160	but if someone uses it against me, I'm not laughing anymore. Okay, this is like really going for my
3718160	3725040	eyes. I have to admit this is a lot of color scheme going on. It's a chomp chomp not to be confused
3725120	3734320	with womp womp. Any chompers? Oh my God, I'm actually... Sorry, I'm actually not doing that bad. Hold on.
3735840	3740000	If I can get lucky and not have items used against me, that'd be grand.
3742320	3747680	I might actually have a decent position unless the reeflings are... Okay, they're plotting. I'm
3747680	3752880	back to sixth place. I'm getting put in my... Sorry, I'm getting put back in my spot again. Sorry,
3752880	3759600	I got a bit over... I got a bit overconfident. I thought maybe there was hope. Uh, I spoke far too
3759600	3771600	soon. I had hope. Okay, I had hope. Stop! That's what you get for being a doodoo haze. Oh no, I missed it.
3772160	3779600	Jump jump jump! It's starting on them. What does that even mean?
3781680	3788800	Who was I fourth and I'm ninth? Are you serious? Oh, I'm still dead luck. Oh, well at least I'm
3788800	3792560	locked on with another reefling. Get wrecked. Both of us suck. What are you gonna do about it?
3793120	3800400	Are you gonna kiss me? Team Slug is getting off target. Start, stop! She's kind of getting
3800400	3806720	the hang of it, not really. Is this where we find out mommy is more sensitive? Jumping,
3806720	3813120	not quite, but showing on your butt. Oh yeah. Right, one more map. I want to pick Hyrule because
3813120	3821040	we saved it the other week. Link, you came to town. You came to save the princess Zelda.
3822560	3850480	I didn't 100% the game. No, about 100% at the figurines, which I've never done before. That was
3850480	3861840	actually pretty crazy. That was crazy. Okay, last lap. Ready. Oh, we got coconut. This doesn't
3861840	3868160	look like coconut mole. Is this like coconut mole version like 3.0 because of how many times
3868160	3874000	they've got it? You just got coconut mold. Wait, is that a thing? Is this a Mario meme I don't know
3874000	3888800	about? Stormy, I will become a chomp chomp. Wait. I'm not even mad that I suck. This is actually
3888800	3902720	a really good song and map. Okay, I don't really want to go in the fountains. I don't think that's
3902800	3910960	going to speed me up at all. Oh my goodness. I just realized there's a mini map to the right
3910960	3918720	that I can see what's kind of up ahead. This is not like Nintendo DS coconut mole. I don't remember
3918720	3927600	any of this. Who is doing burnouts in the middle of the track? Who is doing burnouts in the middle
3927600	3934480	of the freaking track? That's outrageous. Get on my ticket right now. This is? Oh my god, I don't
3934480	3959520	remember it at all. I'm trying. I'm trying so hard right now. Is it going to peel? We'll find
3959520	3966000	out in a minute. We'll find out in a minute. Sorry, sorry replaying that was me. No, I'm sorry.
3966000	3975280	I said the S word. Yeah, I'll take that. I'll show you. No, I said I'm sorry. You're supposed to...
3975280	3981280	Wait, he's got boomerang in his hand. Is that for me? Right, okay. I was getting worried that boomerang
3981280	3988400	was for me. I had to put on the brakes a little there. If you go to the fountain and jump, you can
3988480	3994400	do this trick again. Why is it putting me up the wrong one? There is the other thing.
3996080	4001440	What a few... Okay, trick. Again, I got another bullet. Oh my god, I have a chance to actually be
4001440	4007600	in a decent rank. Not the only time I have a chance to win is when I get given the bullet.
4007600	4020480	Okay, please cars, please, please, please, please. My best score yet. A fifth place. Oh my god,
4020480	4027920	not the only time I literally have a chance to get any score is when I'm five. And that puts me
4027920	4036480	third place. My best ranking. My best ranking third place. Oh my god. Oh my god, record breaking
4036480	4044640	on Team Slag. I got third place. Last third last. Sorry, not third place. Third last. Third last.
4045280	4051280	I did it. And it probably would have been less if Sen was playing because she would have beaten me.
4051280	4057600	I'm not gonna lie. Not gonna lie. Sen would have beaten me. The only way that worked is because
4057600	4064000	I got given a bullet on ninth place. Right, I will reset the lobby and we'll make sure Sen gets in.
4064000	4077040	That was fun. You're ready. Yes. Right, let's do a baby. Oh my god. You know, she looks so determined.
4077040	4085520	I actually ain't seen. Fifth place. The deal is a deal. Time to offer myself up. Reflings. I'm going
4085520	4093920	on the head. No, wait, what? I thought I had to win. You had to win. Right, so what do I want?
4093920	4101760	Acceleration? Acceleration. And then we need a bit of speed or not, I guess.
4104800	4111760	Okay, max acceleration, but that takes in so much speed. I've got no idea. I'm just going for it.
4111760	4121040	Sorry, I have no idea what I'm doing. Look, I'm here for a good time. I don't know anything.
4122000	4126640	Don't be surprised if we don't stream Snape on this game again in the future. That's all I'm saying.
4127280	4133360	She's doing an acceleration build. Oh, that's the MLG. Okay, the lobby code is...
4133360	4144480	I'm stretching, sorry. I need to stretch first before I can even think. Right,
4147360	4155760	a Jai, a T, a 4, a P, and a 2. I have no idea. No, you won fifth or third place.
4155760	4161760	No, you won fifth or third place, lol. I'm offering my body to you.
4163120	4170480	Reefling? I don't know how to tell you this. When I said I was third place, I meant I was third last,
4170480	4174720	which is an improvement on being second and last last. I'm so sorry.
4177200	4185040	Thank you, Kai no one for this purchase. When I said third place, I meant third last because
4185120	4193840	I don't have a chance. Are you strawdier? Are you in? Is she the one with the pink hair?
4194480	4202720	L plus ratio, let's go. Is that? I'll give it my best shot. Is that her? Go easy on me.
4202720	4207600	One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven. Okay, we have room for two more
4207600	4215360	if that's Sen over there in the pink. I don't know if that's Sen or not. Go easy on me.
4216160	4220960	They're crying. It says I'm currently spectating. Check in my head, the lobby isn't full. Why would
4220960	4231920	you say that? I'm looking ass in the game. How dare you? Show yourself. Literally, the lobby's not
4231920	4238000	full. It says one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven. Wait, Sen, have you
4238000	4249760	bought like the online pass from Nintendo servers? Surely you have them. Yeah, they want you to buy
4249760	4254400	like, it's like Xbox Game Pass but for Switch. Do you have the online servers?
4254640	4258720	Yes, okay, you do have it unfortunately.
4261680	4264400	She was in the lobby last time. Oh yeah, you were. What a dumb ass.
4265040	4268560	Wait, it says there's a missing spot so I don't know how you're spectating.
4268560	4273520	One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven. Yeah, there's room for one more.
4275040	4281200	Restart and hide the code with your body and then send it to Sen. Oh no, the refillings are
4281200	4285040	polite enough that they'll back out. I'm seeing twelve. Wait, can I not count? One, two, three,
4285040	4292320	four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven. Where's the twelve? One, two, three, four, five,
4292320	4296880	six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven. No, you're trolling me. You're making me double think numbers
4296880	4306480	and stuff. Did she press flight mode again? We will never know. How are you spectating?
4306720	4314480	Now I'm going to go out on a limb and say that's not Sen. Okay, now there's twelve.
4317440	4320560	Wait, so why are you spectating and not in the lobby?
4322240	4326400	That's bizarre. Why would it make you spectate? I'm not making you spectate.
4327040	4333840	If there's any reflings that have had a shot to play with me today, is it okay if I kindly request
4333840	4344400	you lead to try and get Sen in? Thank you, reflings. Oh, there she is. There she is. Boris Johnson.
4344400	4349200	Thanks for showing up, Boris. We missed you. We missed you, Boris. Then you come. Okay, I don't
4349200	4354560	know why that didn't work at first, but that's definitely her. There's Boris. Hooray. I'm using
4354560	4360400	tilt controls. Wait, are you guys like rubbing it in my face that I have to use evens? Wait,
4360400	4366480	why am I in but I can't see that I'm in? Wait, your switch doesn't even display it? I don't
4366480	4371920	want you to time out again. Are you guys like rubbish connection? It says I'm currently... Well,
4371920	4381120	you're in my lobby. I'm not sure about that. I'm using tilt controls as a... Oh, we missed you, Boris.
4383680	4388800	Why is it so hard to try and team up with the freaking VTuber? I don't know why. Like,
4388800	4394560	anytime two people try and collide that are VTubers, the thing just doesn't work. I think it's
4394560	4402880	on your end, Sen. Yeah. Oh, no, this can't be. Can't a moment. Well, just go for it. VTuber scoff.
4402880	4408480	Literally, like, Minazur were like talking and voice chat for like two hours before the collab,
4408480	4413200	and then like 15 minutes before, everyone needs to clear the lobby and let me be far.
4413920	4419920	Do you want to try that? I need to... Right, okay, hold on. I'm going to reset the lobby.
4422320	4427520	If everyone could kindly let Sen come in first, okay?
4430320	4434320	I trust you guys to show the code, but you're not all going to come flying in, okay?
4435280	4441920	I have no idea what I selected. Right, the code, Sen. Would you kindly...
4443840	4452720	Sen, the code is 042 Charlie Gamma. Sen, getting special treatment.
4453440	4457680	Favouritism by my VTuber? More likely than you think.
4458560	4464240	Shocking behaviour. Shocking. Okay, let's see if she can come in.
4468800	4471520	Anyone else who comes in is getting nuked off the stratosphere.
4475200	4481840	Well, you didn't hesitate, did you? Right, can you see that, Sen? Because we can see you and
4481840	4488560	Big Boris Johnson. Ah, you guys didn't he? Oh, she talked. She talked in game.
4490480	4491520	She talked in game.
4494240	4497520	One, two, three, four. Ew, what is that?
4499200	4505040	You look like a... Oh, okay, five. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine,
4505040	4510640	ten, eleven, twelve. Oh my god, we did it. We did it. It only took us like five whole minutes.
4510640	4516800	Smile. Why is my name Boris now? It was Sinfors Johnny and now I'm Boris?
4517520	4527040	Stop, that's funny. No themes, normal items. Sands from Undertale? How is that Sands from Undertale?
4530400	4535600	Who have we not played? We've not played Grumble Volcano, as far as I'm aware.
4535840	4546560	It was meant to be a part. We're doing it. We're playing together.
4547920	4554560	One race only. Wait, did I mess up? Was it not four races? I've been leaving it on default.
4555680	4560560	Did I mess up? It took us so long to come together and I'm going to ruin it.
4561520	4569120	Hi, thanks for joining. You're welcome to stream snipe. This course has been selected.
4572000	4576320	In chat, your character said four races. Damn straight it is. Okay, here we go.
4578320	4583920	Okay, okay, we're doing it. We're doing it. We're ready, baby Rosalina. Come on, baby Rosalina. I
4583920	4592480	believe in you. Are you squidding me right now? Zion! It's a miracle I could still watch you at 720p
4592480	4597680	out here in the boonies. I believe in you, strongy. Are you putting your face in the wrong
4597680	4604080	streamer? You should put your stonks in as Sin. I'm not even kidding. Right, where is she? We need to
4604080	4612560	try and enable Sin. Either we'll enable Sin or we'll just go for it. Thank you for the tips,
4612640	4622480	Zion. Okay, I don't know where she is. I can't see her. Is she behind me?
4623760	4628880	No, Sin are officially boosting me. Stop, could you imagine? Right, I'm going to keep the green on
4628880	4633840	me so if anyone touches me they get walloped. I said what I said. Right, we're going up the stairs.
4633840	4638720	I'm literally copying the reeflings. I'm keeping the green on me.
4638720	4646320	I'm getting inked on. I'm getting inked on. But it's not that time. I don't know. Give me like
4646320	4653920	less than a week. It's less than a week. Let's do this. As much as I like holding on to that.
4659040	4663440	I like the maps that change. Like they have changing elements. Like the trainers in the way
4663440	4670960	and stuff. I like that. Oops. Oh, the game all steered me away from that. You're so stinky,
4670960	4677520	Mr. Video Game. I don't know. I think Sin might be behind me. I have no idea what character she is.
4679360	4681040	Oopsie. Oh, well that worked.
4686320	4691120	Where is she? Is she ahead? Oh my god. And before she's like first place right now.
4691120	4696400	And she's like I've never played this game before. And she's just absolutely annihilating me.
4703680	4709280	Oh, there's a car. Oh no, I'm in the gravel. Get off the gravel. Off the gravel. Off the gravel.
4712880	4717600	We're almost there. Whoa, whoa, whoa. You can destroy the subway car if you have
4717600	4726400	the dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee on. Come on. Come on. I can make it.
4727280	4732160	I can make it. No, I can't make it if you guys are doing maneuvers like that. Don't be so red.
4734080	4739600	Where is she? Oh god. Damn, she just won't be when I train on one. Literally, the person is so far
4739600	4747440	behind. Is she actually? So you're telling me the secret to winning against the Reeflands
4747440	4751760	is to call in my friends that I've never played Mario Kart. Billets should be banned.
4752720	4758960	You should be getting them. You should be getting the billets because you're last. The game should
4758960	4766400	have a higher rate of getting the billets. That's hilarious. Wait, are you on your desktop?
4766400	4773040	Can I get you in a Discord call? If you're at your desktop, I can literally open up Discord right
4773040	4777440	now and get your voice on stream. I don't know if you're on your desktop though or if you're just
4777440	4784880	chilling. How does that help you beat the Reeflings? Well, it'll make me higher up in general.
4785200	4795200	Baby Park? Is that the worst map in the game? Baby Park?
4795200	4817040	Yeah, that's unfortunately how it is when you're left.
4818000	4825360	So you need to use the triggers to like tilt and then a boost you or something, but I don't really
4825360	4832640	understand it. So yeah, I just kind of ignore the whole mechanic. I'm sure the mechanic is
4832640	4838320	literally the reason why I'm losing, but oh no, I'm on the sand. Don't go on the sand.
4838400	4842160	Don't go on the sand. How is there sand and snow?
4844480	4850720	Oh, it's clouds. We're in the clouds. Oh, it's Jack and the Beanstalk. That's so cute.
4850720	4854000	Okay, I like this map. Wait, I like this map. It's very cute.
4856720	4864160	You go around a circle seven times? Not in this map. I only did it. I did everything like four
4864720	4872240	rounds of three, four rounds of three. That's not even a sentence. Do you want to try again?
4872960	4881040	There's four races in a circuit. Come on, oh wait. Honestly, I'm like, should I just
4881040	4888720	shove myself into walls? That may work. You know, I read his pen bananas on the track.
4889440	4896640	Literally, you know how like, there's always a music tag and they're like, oh, on the beat.
4896640	4903440	His pen bananas on the track is going to be my one. Okay. Oh no. I've just checked the HUD on the
4903440	4911920	right side. Sin person. She's like on her own all the way back there. I feel really bad.
4912640	4917120	Should I drive next to her? You know what? I'll wait up. I'll wait up. Oh,
4917200	4925360	she's got a bullet. She's got a bullet. She's coming. Okay, she's coming. There she goes.
4926560	4932960	Look at Sin. Right, let's spectate her gameplay. Let's, ow, let's spectate that gameplay.
4934160	4939120	Okay, she's cat. She's going around. She's picked up an item. Oh, she's picked up a bullet,
4939120	4942880	bro. If I can, you keep up. Not me last place because I was trying to freaking hang out with Sin.
4942880	4950240	Bro, she got a bullet. Why am I sideways? Okay, that's fine. I'll love it. Okay.
4951760	4956880	I got kicked. Why am I hacked by a random boy? Wait, how did you get kicked? You were literally
4956880	4963600	right in front of me. Wait, you were. I came in before you. Why? How do you get timed out?
4964000	4970880	Oh, Shrani got her hair putts and she can't hear us. Goose trying to go. 78% on town, mom.
4974160	4978240	I'm going to do Wailed Woods. This is where I'm going to live with the Weeflings.
4979280	4982960	How do you keep getting kicked? You have like other rubbish connection or something.
4983280	4992480	Shrani, love. We feel a love. I just caught that in the last tip.
4993600	4998240	Band items are for with these. Sin just can't win. You might be able to rejoin me.
5000320	5004000	I'm not sure. Are you squiddin' me right now? Piney, spiny.
5004080	5009280	Tell Sin that so far she has earned more points as Boris in this Mario Kart Tournament
5009280	5015520	than he did in his last popularity poll. Bruh. I ain't seein' that. Bruh.
5018000	5025040	Thank you for the tip, tiny spiny. Bruh. Bruh. Two. No.
5026000	5033600	Oh, finally. I did it. Where the hell are we? We're in France! You know how you can tell?
5033600	5039920	Because that's that one monument. They want to shut down the traffic at it because it's so bad.
5041520	5046880	Oh, wait. Isn't the Olympics on? Or isn't the Olympics about to be on in France?
5056000	5062160	I don't know how to say it in any other language. V gets Lou Olympics.
5063120	5064640	Lou Olympics are awful.
5067200	5072640	Okay, everyone's getting bananas. To say a banana- Oh, who just bummed me? To say banana in French?
5072640	5079360	Or say unne-banane? That's right. Bananas are feminine in French. Why? I don't know.
5079840	5085360	No. Wait, are they? Did I just make that up? Be honest. I think I just made that up. In banana.
5086240	5094080	It just means one banana. A banana. New banana? La banana? What the heck am I supposed to do with
5094080	5099680	all these? I have no idea. That was so much for no- I don't know what I'm supposed to do with those.
5101760	5107200	They are feminine- Why would a banana be feminine in any language? Be honest right now. We all know
5107200	5113760	what a banana is. I'm not sure. It makes no sense. I literally make no sense.
5115920	5124160	And it's like, I'm pretty sure Bos and French are feminine as well, but a man's winky in French is-
5124160	5132320	Are you kidding me? You took my thing. You took my golden thing. You're so stinky.
5133280	5139200	I'm actually so stinky. Whoever did the thunderbolt? One, you aren't Zeus. You aren't him. And two,
5141360	5146400	you stink. I can smell you and how hard you're sweating to ruin my game. That's right.
5147520	5150720	You're not pheromone maxing. You're pheromone
5152640	5159680	bogan. Oh, that's right. Take that insult. Take that insult. Take it. What are you going to do? Yeah,
5160560	5165760	yeah, yeah. Where am I going? Oh, thank God. Oh, thank God. Oh, him just came in right now because
5165760	5176240	I did not do that. That was- Oh, it says unironically. Okay, I got it. Oh, this is what I need. So I don't
5176240	5181760	have to aim. Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go. Okay, I made
5181840	5184400	it 8th. I literally cheated and made it to 8th place because of that.
5187520	5196240	Die Banane in German is female. Spanish is word un banana. She hates us all, girl. He can't recover
5196240	5204480	from that emotional damage. Yeah, please don't be surprised if I don't play this game on stream
5204480	5208880	tonight for no particular reason at all. It's because I'm a share of the game. Yeah, for no reason,
5209760	5220240	I don't really think we're going to be- Royal Raceway, King Candy, D.K. Donkey Kong, D.K.
5221520	5231120	Donkey Kong is here. I'm finally back to kick something. The banana in Turkey is a must.
5231440	5242320	I don't know why she's breaking out, but that was fun that she joined in anyway.
5242320	5245920	She's probably got prepared for streamers. I don't know if she's streaming the day.
5245920	5250560	She does Elden Ring and she actually plays it properly if you want to watch her Elden Ring streams.
5252160	5257920	If you want to actually watch someone play Elden Ring,
5258800	5264960	send sister on Twitch at 8pm GMT. I actually don't know what time she's streaming.
5267280	5272240	I can't remember what time she's streaming that. It's a bit later. I think it's a bit later.
5273760	5280400	Are you- Luigi, you just bumped me like three times. You know that cost money after the second
5280400	5285920	throw to the second bump. Oh my god, we're bouncing though.
5287760	5294640	Received it. No, no, don't start guessing my freaking name. That's naughty replaying.
5294640	5304240	That's naughty and you know it's naughty. Oh my god, I think I just sniked Rosalina. I'm so sorry.
5304560	5314560	I'm sorry. More like Pozalina, who's all she cares about. I'm just- I don't know what I'm even talking.
5315520	5321600	I saw that. Whoever's in that freaking red car, I literally saw you just try and green me.
5322880	5329040	What's your name? Mar? More like Shitebag McGee. Don't ever do that again. I literally saw you
5329040	5336640	attempt that in Four Cave. I was shocking. I was shocking, honestly. Streams every day.
5338080	5345120	You know, I'm actually speechless at that attempt on my life that you just made.
5345120	5351440	Oh, I can do a flip. No, I can't. I'm too late. I'm actually speaking- Oh! Who just pinged that
5352400	5356800	Oh my god, he went halfway across the map. Okay, last lap.
5361360	5368160	Okay, I can do it. I can do it. Yatta, yatta, yatta, yatta. I'm doing all the gambas,
5368160	5372400	but nothing's working out. Okay, nothing's working. I'm just here for a good time, not for a long time.
5372400	5380400	Okay, please. Please understand. Okay, yeah, fuck you. I'm so sorry to that reflin. I'm so sorry.
5380480	5386560	No, I'm so sorry. It's not me. It's not me. It's the game. It's the game.
5387520	5392880	The game. Oh, I almost messed up so badly. I'm third place. I'm third place.
5396000	5406160	I'm sprouted. Oh, I can't believe it. Oh, I got 11 points. Oh my god. I'm still second place though. Oh.
5406400	5426640	Oh. Oh, I'm still second place though. Oh no. Oh no. I thought I did so well there.
5428480	5431760	I'm sorry. I got so excited. I thought I did it.
5432080	5441600	No, literally say, wait, was that last place? I'm not last though. I'm not last. That was fun.
5441600	5450160	Yatta, good game. Okay, we do one more. Maybe two more. We have time for two more. One more two more.
5450400	5461680	Wow. You're not last though. Broke him third place for nothing. Stop. I'm trying. Right.
5463600	5471680	Why are we like male? Shirley peaches the Barbie to use. Wait, hold on. I need to do the plus thing.
5474000	5479840	Right. You want me to go all out on acceleration? Okay, the burger mobile is acceleration. The wheels
5479840	5490320	are acceleration. Why? Will on airs does any of this mean? Right. Let's just fucking go all out
5490320	5498560	on acceleration in the burger mobile. Okay. I swear. I don't know why your switch is missing.
5498560	5507440	Congrats on 15k, by the way. I have so much ASMR debt. I'm actually 15,000. That's insane. Hold on a
5507440	5516720	minute. I ain't laughing. Hold on a minute. Am I actually 15,000? What? I am. I'm 15,000. What the
5516720	5530080	heck? Reflins, where are you all coming from? What the heck? So one, that is some more video
5530080	5536000	kind of blew up. The real thigh cupping and the please let me hold it like blew up twice.
5538160	5548000	Yeah, I looked up and there was a fix. So let's find it. Congrats. Make it 20k before the bathroom.
5548000	5555280	Well, the 15k ASMR celebration stream is a thigh cam ASMR. Like you're literally going to see my thighs
5556240	5560800	and it's going to be pointed down on the ASMR making. We do thigh ASMR
5562480	5570640	and like you can see me like do the the making. So I don't know what to do for 20k in all honesty.
5570640	5574880	I ain't thought that far ahead. I've not even got my freaking ASMR collapse up and all that stuff.
5575040	5587600	I'm going to aim back. What? Why are you gifting me 50 memberships for sucking at this video game?
5589760	5597760	El Jeff. Thank you. What the heck? Thank you. El Jeff. That's amazing. Oh my gosh. That's so
5597760	5603520	what? Why are you giving me gifted memberships for sucking so badly at a game? That's huge.
5603520	5609040	Thank you. I think I've just unlocked a new emotes slot for that as well. What the heck?
5609040	5614880	Thank you. Congrats to those who caught it with your face and enjoy the emotes. We have more emotes
5614880	5619360	on the way and by more emotes on the way, I mean I need to ask you guys what more emotes you'd like
5619360	5627520	to be on the way. Thank you so much. For those of you who don't talk in like the actual chat,
5627520	5632000	I think there might be a prompt to say to accept gifted memberships. I'm not sure,
5632640	5638320	but you might see it now. I don't know how it works. But yes, anyone's welcome to join the lobby
5638320	5646160	because I think Sin can't get in at all. But thank you so much. El Jeff. More like El Chad.
5646160	5656800	Waps down 50 gifted memberships. Walks away doesn't say anything. Chad behavior. Shocking Chad behavior.
5657600	5663920	I'm a little nervous. I'm a little nervous. Gulp. I'm you. Hooray.
5667520	5673680	Isn't that a deal? How do I join in? There's a room ID code to the right of my head.
5675120	5682880	I'm pointing to it with my tongue. And then you use that code to join. As long as you have the game
5682880	5687760	and stuff though. If you don't have the game, unfortunately, I can't help you pass that.
5690960	5695040	El Jeff doesn't look at explosions. He just walks away like a badass.
5697920	5708000	Reefling Delilah. How many is that? 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12. That's us. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7,
5708000	5719920	8, 9, 10, 11, 12. Let's go. Oh wait. No. You guys are being forced to carry me. Do you understand
5719920	5729360	Reeflings are in this lobby? Okay. Wait, you got in? Okay. You're being forced to carry me.
5729360	5738080	You're being forced to carry me. Do you understand? This is online so I can't join.
5739120	5743680	Strowny moment. I literally do not know how to play. Well, you're still carrying me anyway.
5743680	5750560	I'm going to vote Sherbert Land. Oh wait. Melody Motorway? Oh my god. Melody. That hit
5750640	5759760	VTuber Melody. Project Melody. Strowny carry at the end. Team Strowny versus Team Sin. I got the
5759760	5764160	game. I just need to know how to hop in. There's like four of them. I should be like multiplayer
5764160	5770080	and then a code. Oh yes. Because I'm last. I'm kicked out of Team Slag. I see you. Wait. It didn't
5770080	5775840	let me pick. I just picked two teams. Am I going crazy? Don't forget to hit that like and subscribe
5775840	5783200	button. Oh, I'm such a real VTuber honestly. Do you enjoy playing games with me, Reeflings?
5783200	5787920	Don't forget to like the stream to let me know you want more stream sniping. I say that as if
5787920	5794000	we're not playing chess next week. Literally brush up on your chess. Okay. The red team versus the blue
5794000	5803040	team. Let's see what happens. Sauce to my team in advance, bro. Sauce to my team in advance.
5803040	5810240	That's right. Let's see. Go.
5815120	5825840	Okay. Now this is curious. This is very curious indeed. Because now that it's teamed,
5826800	5837520	I am actually sorry. I'm going to try hard for this one. I don't want to let my team down.
5838640	5846160	I don't want to let my team down, mom. I have to try my hardest in Mario Kart. I really don't want
5846160	5854960	to upset anybody. I can't let them down. They try so hard for me. Literally every enemy ever.
5856800	5864000	No, mom. You can't forbid me from doing the tournament. I need to try everything in my power.
5866160	5871520	That sounds like every enemy protagonist. Please. I tried my best. Fuck it. I just destroyed a train.
5875840	5883200	No, I can't give in yet. I have to try my hardest. My team, they're relying on me.
5884160	5892320	Oh, I need to do everything in my power. Maybe stop with the bombs. Oh, but I can't let the bombs
5892320	5901360	stop me. Even if I'm not first place, I have to give it my all. Come on, team. Wish the best for me.
5903840	5909280	Oh, shit. The short cut for a minute. Sorry. I'm too busy. It is an enemy European right now.
5909600	5920160	Oh, no. I've been struck by lightning, but I can't let that get me down. Oh, my gosh.
5920160	5928640	I'm almost there. I'm trying so hard. But in the end, maybe it didn't even matter for my team.
5929200	5934640	I'm on the last lap. Oh, no. A bomb stopped me in my track.
5935600	5942880	Okay. Oh, wait. Just help me. I'm going to squid everywhere. Come on, me. Come on.
5942880	5945920	So is anyone to let them down on Ironically? I need to try hard right now.
5947680	5952320	Donkey Kong, you might have ruined this map for me, but that's not going to stop me.
5953200	5962080	Oh, my gosh. I'm blasting ahead of the enemies. I can do it. I'm almost there. Please. No. Please.
5962080	5967120	I'm actually trying hard and so much. Don't be rid. Don't be rid. I'm trying hard and so much.
5967120	5977600	I don't even know what color team I am. I'm about to come. I'm about to buzz. Okay. Hold on. I'm
5977600	5984080	just going to let all of you take over. I'm trying my best, please. Believe in me, team. I might not
5984160	5989600	be the first place, but I tried my best. Come on, buddy. Team mate. Come on, buddy.
5992480	5997360	Strony. Strony was a fanboy. Is that what you're saying? Your father, the villain,
5997360	6002720	and he sent all your enemies. Wait, what was the result? I didn't pay attention. Did we win?
6003920	6010080	I actually did worse than Strony and I'm on our team. No, you're supposed to carry me. Carry me.
6011040	6015360	And then we'll play this game again if you carry me.
6018240	6021840	Anyway, I'm in now. Hydration check.
6026080	6032320	Okay, I seem to have the inability to not be able to drink properly. I have spilled cola on me three
6032320	6037280	times a stream. I don't know what you're doing to me, reflings, but I'm getting nervous. I'm getting
6037280	6042480	shaky, okay? I've spilled cola three times on myself. I don't know what's going on.
6043280	6049120	Your comments made me laugh so hard I messed up. What are you talking about? I'm just a regular
6049120	6056960	anime protagonist. I just have to try my best for my team, even if I don't come first. As long as
6056960	6065680	I try my best, everything will work out in the end, right? Thanks, math, for the 20 gifted memberships.
6065680	6073120	Congrats to those who caught it with your face. That's right. Even if you're not the protagonist,
6073120	6080960	you can try your best to be the main person in your story. It's okay if you're an NPC.
6080960	6086800	I'm so sorry. This is so first. Okay, let me try hard. I don't want to let my teammates down. Hold
6086800	6094880	on. Unironically, I don't want to let them down. Even when I try my best, I'm such a baka. They're
6094960	6100640	going to know that I'm not good at this game. Maybe they'll figure out that I actually haven't
6100640	6108960	played it in a whole year, and the only experience I have with Mario Kart is actually in my childhood.
6108960	6116320	Oh no, I can't let them know. I'll just pretend I'll fake it until I make it.
6116880	6126880	This is absolutely tearing up my voice. Okay, okay, we cleared that banana off the tracks.
6128560	6136000	That's my DJ signature. Banana off the tracks. Bananas and pajamas. They're coming in the stairs.
6136560	6143360	Bananas. Oh, red. Right, I must be team blue. There's no way I'm not team blue.
6144080	6150800	Due to the data that I have collected, i.e. on the right side, bottom right of the screen is blue,
6150800	6156640	I assume that is me. Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, let's focus up. God, this track is tiny.
6157760	6161600	Every is so tiny. Okay, hold on. I need you to kick in, please.
6163200	6166240	Right, get flamethrowered. There's nothing you can do about it.
6166800	6176800	Oh, did I do it? Did we win? Your team blue. Okay, where's the ASMR? I think you just
6176800	6180240	liked someone on your team. Oh, is that even possible? Thank you so much again,
6180240	6184320	Math for the gifted membership and LGF. That's insane. I'm pretty sure you guys have just
6184320	6194400	collectively unlocked an emoteslot. Oh no, we're losing. I just, oops, I think we're losing.
6196560	6203680	Ah, I'll do the electro dome. I don't know what. Oh, we're losing. Red is carrying.
6203680	6209760	Who hit me with the shell? We're on the same damn team. Press L on the card screen or something.
6211440	6218320	So close to the 96-69. Team Sen is pulling ahead. I can't believe it.
6219280	6223840	Reflames, you're supposed to like, I don't know, carry me.
6226080	6231600	And before you guys are like, you're uncariable. How do I pause? There's no pause.
6232400	6236080	You would have to do it mid-game, I think. I don't know, maybe you could do it like right now.
6238320	6243840	No one is allowed to say I'm uncariable. Okay, only my butt. You're allowed to insult my butt
6243840	6248640	and say my butt's uncariable. So sit on your face. As it, if you don't carry me, everyone's
6248640	6252640	getting a 30-second face sit. I don't care if you can't breathe, it's over for you.
6252640	6260640	Oh, we're playing the Legend of Zelda map. Okay, let's go. Hyrule. Third race. Two remaining.
6260640	6262560	Well, one remaining technically after this.
6263280	6271840	Uh, two, wow. It's always really that much of a negative. I feel like it helps me.
6271840	6277280	Oh my god, the coins are runes in this. Oh, I love it. Or rupees, sorry.
6280480	6288240	Oh, I love it. I'm like way behind again. I'm trying, I'm trying, I'm trying.
6289200	6298560	Wow. Oh no, I never shook it in time. Oh my god, the soundtrack is Legend of Zelda as well.
6298560	6307520	This is so cute. I can hear it. I can hear it. Oh my god, that was a Hyruleian sword. Oh my god.
6307520	6312400	I love this one, sorry. Oh my god. References that I actually know for once when it comes to
6312480	6318080	Nintendo. Thank you, Minish Cap. We love you. We love you, Minish Cap.
6319920	6322560	Please owe him, so I don't have to freaking steer.
6327840	6334640	Thank you, Zarya. Anything for you, Refling. Anytime, it's a pleasure. I think my next ASMR
6334640	6337520	upload is me sitting on the make. I don't think I'm going to get in trouble for it,
6337520	6340560	because it's literally me just... Oh wait, no, I'm out of breath on it.
6340880	6341840	I don't think I can do it.
6344160	6346640	Oh, the wee baby's laughing. She's like,
6347600	6352400	honestly, I'd be laughing too. Okay. Wait, let me focus up. Let me focus up.
6353920	6356400	I'm just fucking throwing everything.
6356400	6370400	Oh my god, it's so long-inspired. I love Legend of Long.
6371520	6379680	Any Legend of Long fans? Sorry. I'm trying to make the best of the situation, but I'm so bad at the
6379680	6385440	game. As if you just streamstepped my box. I hope you're at least on my team.
6386880	6389200	Oh my god, someone's going to head with a freaking bullet.
6390000	6393280	But not to be confused with the hit band, Bullet for My Valentine,
6394720	6397040	which I can't even remember one single song from them.
6402000	6403280	Oh, that's like so fast.
6404000	6411840	Oh, I love... I'm sorry. Best map, sorry. I'm biased right now. I'm actually biased.
6411840	6418480	Oh, no, no, no, no, no. I'm so tiny. There's nothing wrong with being tiny, okay.
6419840	6426960	SPH Bulls, rise up. Seriously. Wait, go, go, go. Okay, I got seventh place.
6427200	6433680	Is that what that means? Did I get seventh place? Oh, I did actually get seventh place.
6435360	6438800	Oh my god, that's actually not... Oh my god, I'm like legit seventh place. Hold on a minute.
6439440	6444480	Hold on a minute. Hold on a minute. Oh, can we bring it back though? Kiki9 is trying
6444480	6450640	as hard as to carry all of us. Sit on top, lad. Seventh place, you got one position higher.
6451680	6456400	I'll be so positioned high on you. I tried, I tried. I can't do it off the top of my head.
6456400	6462560	I tried so... No, no, stop showing me the DLC, honestly. Get away. Hold on. Let's pick.
6466160	6469680	Did we end up? Have we played the cheese? Let's do animal crossing.
6471200	6476960	Send best team, send red top on top. Thank you again, Zarian, for the tip. I will suffocate you.
6477520	6489760	Can blue make the comeback, unless all of us collectively like five head this?
6490640	6497040	I don't think so. There's only so much carrying the top blue person can do.
6497040	6500240	I'm always last, but Team Sin winnin'. Bravo, literally.
6501200	6503520	Like, oh my god, I can't believe it.
6504560	6513520	Send it on top of strongy. If anything, I'd be dominating Sin. Thank you, I'll be here all week.
6515760	6521040	Okay, final race. This is it. This is it. Let's make or break.
6521520	6531840	Let's go. Hold on a minute. Hold on a minute, Luigi. We're on the same team now. You just can't
6531840	6538560	win. You just can't win, Luigi. Why am I drifting that way? Please don't do that again.
6539360	6541360	Wow.
6544320	6550880	Oh my god, that's actually so creative. That's so good. Thank you, Sleepy Phoenix.
6550880	6556240	That's so creative. I'm sorry, I'm bumping everyone. Call me Mario because I'm going to carry.
6556240	6561520	What? Call me Mario because I'm going to princess carry that peach. Hey, smooth with it.
6561520	6568240	I'm so slow. I can't believe there's unironically a Mario meta. This is insane.
6569280	6574160	This game's too difficult for brainless like me. Sometimes we just want to
6576080	6581120	be dumb. Is that too much to ask for? To be left alone in my dumbassery?
6583840	6586240	Oh, there's a ch- What?
6586560	6588560	What?
6590160	6597040	Literally, what were we supposed to do? A freaking train? Wait, that was my teammate. I'm sorry.
6597040	6602080	I didn't realize you had to be tactical with items. I thought they all did it. Like, oh, that's my teammate.
6603680	6609840	Oh my god, I'm 11th now. Oh, there was a train. I wasn't looking. This is why you shouldn't
6609840	6615040	drive whilst on your phone because you will not see what you have to do unironically.
6617200	6622320	Oh my gosh. Last lap. We're on like a whole different map.
6625200	6635040	Stop. You're being bully. Okay. Hold on. Oh no, no, no, no, no. You're not supposed to do that.
6636160	6642880	I'm 7th again. I mean, it's something. I'll take it. Can I get something that'll speed me up? No,
6643760	6648080	not really what I want to do. I'm just going to have to- Oh, I just walked into my own green
6648080	6652000	shell. No one saw that. That's embarrassing. I actually just went into my own green shell.
6655600	6659360	Bruh, I suck so bad at it. I'm 10.
6659680	6667040	I think sin won. I think sin won.
6669760	6674480	Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay, we lost, but that's okay.
6675440	6683280	Yatta. Go Red Team. You did it. No way. We don't even get a participation trophy. You guys get like
6683280	6689600	a nice shiny trophy. And what did we get? Nothing. We don't even get a little medallion.
6689600	6697600	Like, oh, congrats. You did it. Bruh. So rude. Oh no, now we have to get sound. Exactly. This is
6697600	6706640	your punishment for not carrying me. That is shong. GG. Do you want one more or will we call it
6706640	6712800	there and redirect into someone? It's up to you guys. Do you want one more or 16 points?
6712800	6719280	Blue caught up from 30 points. That's huge though. You get a moist handshake and you will love it.
6720320	6724560	One more? One more? Okay, like, I'll restart the lobby just to give
6724560	6729280	other reflings a chance to streamstamp, okay? And then we'll do one more team game,
6729280	6734480	and then I might be able to win. I might be able to win if reflings carry me.
6736880	6741200	Don't be surprised if you slip on my banana. That is actually really good.
6741200	6743920	Does that have my soundboard up? No, I don't have my soundboard up. Dram.
6745040	6748240	Drat. I don't have my soundboard up. Okay, I just, I'll just pick we...
6749440	6755280	Eepee. Okay, we're called Daisy now. Daisy, Duke, Spiky. Wait, is that not Madame?
6757440	6762240	No, I've not played Daisy. Okay, sorry, sorry. I'm being dumb. Give me a second.
6762880	6766880	Right, what do I want to do? Speed. Maybe let's do a bit more speed.
6767120	6771680	Well, that wasn't exactly what I wanted to do, but hey, oh, well I did it anyway.
6772640	6783680	One Sierra. Eight Sierra. Zero. I got kicked again from the final race, but your team's still one?
6783680	6789680	Bruv. Just say you're lucky, Sin. You weren't even participating in the last race and still win.
6790320	6794240	I dare you. These accusations are shopping.
6794960	6796480	Hey.
6802160	6802960	Ah, hold on.
6808000	6816320	Is Sin in? Are you one back in? The game just hates me. Do you want back in, Sin, or are you just back in?
6817840	6821040	That's right, I'm forcing you to watch my stream. What are you going to do about it, Sin?
6821760	6828800	Only if you streamed on YouTube, I could redirect into you. Oh my god, I let a reflin last one. Oh
6828800	6834400	my god, Sin is so selfless. Like, look how nice that she is. Right, one, two, three, four, five,
6834400	6841520	six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11, 12. We're all here. Right, carry me. Do you understand? Do you
6841520	6849200	understand me, reflings? Oh my, I realize I'm dumb. I'm too embarrassed to confess. Wait,
6849760	6854560	have you been disconnecting yourself manually? I'm not going to switch the teams. I'm just going
6854560	6863200	to leave them as is. So, I'll let the teams randomize. Sin, have you been doing something?
6869120	6873520	What have you been doing? Did we play the Animal Crossing? I don't think I did.
6873920	6879600	Yeah, last game. So, you guys better not let me lose.
6881440	6888800	Call everyone who is in my team. I am summoning you to possess yourself with the most gaming
6888800	6894240	spirit you could possibly have. Gaming kitsune. Strony, I need you to stop my face more than
6894240	6899920	I need to breathe. So, please, smother me. Repeat. I'm going to end up killing you guys by accident.
6899920	6908560	So, basically, so, basically, I realized I was in the full game. I looked back on my phone at the
6908560	6912320	screen and was further back in the stream. So, I thought we had another game, but it was just,
6913120	6922000	I wasn't watching you live. Was that English? Good luck. What? What are you talking about?
6922800	6931360	No. She was behind on stream. So, you thought it was, right. So, I was behind on stream. Right.
6931360	6939040	Okay. On the last race. Right. And what, and you ditched? Right. I'm on the red team now.
6939440	6949920	Okay. Oops. I'm on the sand, but that kind of works.
6952400	6958800	Okay. Come on, red team. Do it. I'll beat the blue ones up back here. Don't worry. I'll handle these
6958800	6968160	reeflings. They're all getting smothered one by one. It's so ugly. No, not sin being gone.
6968160	6970320	Now I'm last place all over again, bro.
6973280	6978960	Diabolical. Diabolical. What are these wheels as well?
6988880	6991360	Oh my god. I'm trying so hard. You have no idea.
6991760	6999840	Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I think you're a teammate. I just sandbagged myself.
7001760	7007440	Why is it when I do so good? I like completely mess it up. Whoa. You almost touched me, Luigi.
7008160	7013360	That felt personal. That felt personal. I'm not the one. That felt personal.
7013520	7020720	Mm-hmm. I'm aware. I'm aware of what you've done. I like that noise.
7023360	7029600	Okay. Okay. I'm not last. I'm not last. I'm not letting my team down. Hold on.
7031680	7037680	Okay. I'm gonna, yeah, fuck you for one. You're next if you touch me. Do you understand?
7038400	7046400	Take, yes, if you understand how fucked you are. Shit. Right. No one touch me. No one touch me.
7046400	7051600	You're gonna regret it. Yeah, fuck you. You're done. Yeah, but you're done for.
7052560	7057600	That's right. That's right. That's right. That's right. Tell them how it is. Tell them how it is.
7057600	7064080	Tell them how it is. Tell them how it is. Yep. Yep. Tell them how it is. Wait, how did you?
7064480	7071120	Okay. I actually am not letting my team down. I'm actually not letting my team down.
7073680	7080240	Nine points? I'll take it. Right. I was in the fourth on the last race, so excuse me. Get on my
7080240	7087600	level. Oh, right. Okay. So the game didn't have a fit. Oh, right. Okay. Oh, my God. They need to start
7087600	7092480	giving me bullets right before the finish in line, like, all the time, because it's actually
7092480	7098800	meaning I'm not last. What have we not played? Have we played Wario's Stadium?
7100320	7106560	Well, we'll find out in a minute. Fourth place? That's crazy. Stroni has learned how to cart
7106560	7113520	the Mario in one stream. Any Mario of carters? Any cart to Mario's? Right. She literally did
7113520	7120800	just get on my level. Why, everyone keep bumping into, who driving these carts? Honestly.
7121760	7122640	Shocking behavior.
7131040	7135360	Question for those that say mommy is carried by the bullet and not our team. How heavy is
7135360	7141280	mommy's cheek? I have no idea. I've not weighed myself in months. I have no idea what my weight is.
7143040	7147680	Want to find out? Want to find out, huh? You want to find out in person, Franklin?
7148400	7155920	Don't think I won't do it. When other streamers shyly, I push further and further
7156640	7161760	to the inappropriate level. Oh, no, I messed up the start, right? Bruh, I'm too busy,
7161760	7168320	six and to fucking focus on the game. Hold on. Okay, okay, focus up, focus up. Come on.
7170080	7173840	I would do the, I would do the anime voice again, but I'm not gonna lie. That really hurt my throat.
7174560	7177680	Not the mud, not the mud, but someone please think of the mud.
7182640	7188320	Oh, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch. The ring of fire and it.
7193360	7199760	Keep going, teammates. I believe in you. Go on without me. I'll be fine.
7200640	7206080	I am messing up so badly. Don't tell the red team. I am absolutely
7206880	7213120	just decimating any semblance of success for them. Don't tell them though. They don't need to know.
7213920	7217680	They don't need to know, okay? They don't need to know. It's fine. They don't need to know.
7219280	7224560	Oh my god, right, okay. I'm safe for a little bit in case anyone wants to use anything against me.
7224560	7227520	Oh my god, we did a flip though. Oh, we did a flip though.
7231200	7237360	Okay, I'm still a living place, so it's not looking that good. I'm gonna be honest.
7237360	7244800	It could look better. It could look a lot better right now. Okay, let's not, okay.
7248000	7251840	Oh, look, I was fourth place last time. It's fine. I was fourth place last time.
7252080	7256240	It truly is fine. Hold on. Let me grab these and then Priya get a bullet.
7256240	7260640	Give me two bullets in a row if you love me. Thank you. Thank you. The game loves me.
7261760	7267200	I love you too, game. Right, ruin. I'm literally coming for you. I am literally going in front
7267200	7273760	of your ruin. You are literally my opposition. What is this? I don't want to attack my teammates.
7274480	7276080	Oh, fuck it.
7282000	7288720	Well, it worked. I'm ninth place now. Look, it was tactical sabotage. It was tactical sabotage,
7288720	7295440	okay? It was tactical. It was tactical. There was a point. Speaking of sabotage,
7295440	7300000	by the Beastie Boys. No way he got in front of me.
7302800	7307040	No, I messed that up so badly. I think I could have done a lot better.
7309840	7314560	Come on. Oh, my God, it sounded like one of those chickens that you're squeaking and out.
7317520	7322320	You know those chickens that dogs play with? Those like plastic things? Do you know what I mean?
7325760	7334880	Are we winning? Oh, we're winning. The rubber chickens. Yeah, literally. Should I do rubber
7334880	7344800	chicken ASMR? I don't know. I've just discovered I can kind of make that noise. I went strolling
7344800	7353840	to make the noises too. It's so accurate. You're going to lift me. Have we done sweet canyon? You
7353840	7358880	don't need the rubber chicken. You are the rubber chicken. Girlfriend, rubber chicken ASMR should
7358880	7374960	sleep. I've just discovered I can kind of make that noise. Oh, my God. Hydration check.
7375680	7384160	We're doing it. This is how she distracts the other team. Yes, close your ears, my teammates.
7384160	7389680	I'm going to distract them. Are you going to be a good boy for me? Are you going to let me go
7389680	7398960	in front? Don't you not want to see the view from behind, little wreathling? Don't you want to see
7398960	7409280	it all? If you're in front of me, how can you see me? Come on, wreathling, for me. Just for me.
7413920	7423520	Let mommy be first. Did I work? Did I work? Come on, red team. Filter in, please. Oh,
7423520	7439920	no, I messed up. What is this map? There's a lot of bumping. I see a lot of bumping. Not going
7439920	7447520	to lie. I'm getting bumped to smithereens right now. Maybe that should be my tactic all along.
7447520	7454480	Maybe I should just do that. Oh, this is so cool. I like this map. Are we going back in the war?
7455280	7467600	Are we going out of the war? I'm sideways. What's a piranha do? Wait, what? I've never had a piranha
7467600	7483840	before. How strange. How strange. That was an interesting item, a piranha. They must be super
7483840	7496240	rare. Okay, okay. Back to being 12th place. Hold on. I need the bullet, please. Give me a bullet for
7496240	7507680	my Valentine's at the Mario Kart battle pass. I just shit on my ass and I bootied up my PC
7507680	7517520	because I need mood to get that Fortnite battle pass. Again, I messed. What am I doing so wrong?
7518080	7525920	I tried so hard, but in the end, it probably isn't going to matter, but I'm trying. I'm 9th
7525920	7531280	place. I'll take it. I'm 9th place. This is the best I've done and however long. Right, okay,
7531280	7539760	it's fine. I just don't want to be last. Oh my god, there's a bullet. Stop it. You're such
7539760	7545760	bullies, reflinges. You're supposed to let me win. What do you mean my voice isn't safe? Say what
7545760	7553520	I'm fucking angry. Reflings, let me win. Fuck take. Let me win. Let me win. Let me win. Sorry,
7553520	7558080	but let me win. It's actually, it's literally by a ball here. Right, I'm passing. I passed the blue,
7558080	7564400	so I'm winning. Stop putting bananas on the track. The bananas go in marshmallow. I'm not on the track.
7565680	7571120	Oh my god. I actually want to win so badly. No, I don't want to hurt my teammate.
7572080	7580320	I'm literally 12th place. Bro, I'm literally an anchor. I'm literally an anchor. I'm getting
7580320	7588240	did not finish. I'm that. Oh, I'm an anchor. Are we winning? Oh my god, I'm such an anchor.
7590080	7596800	What is it? Oh my god, we're still somehow doing it. I don't know, but we're still somehow doing it.
7597360	7603840	Oh my god, clutched three. I did not clutch. I was third and got hit by a hundred items,
7603840	7609760	so now I'm 7th. You literally kept me from starting that right. Oh my god, I'm getting annihilated.
7611200	7616800	I've been Mario circuit. Oh, shaggle falls. That's cute.
7619600	7623200	The red carry is crazy. Literally the only way I'm going to win this game
7624160	7628720	is by one, sorting into teams, and then two, getting carried by those team members.
7629760	7634240	A fun idea. Make it a challenge. Whoever are the third, three people that finish behind
7634240	7639920	Strony are considered first, second, and third. No, it's not going to work like that. There's no way.
7645440	7651440	KK9's back must be hurting a lot by now. We are winning, at least I'm faster than a fish woman.
7651440	7656400	How dare you? I'm literally so good at swimming. I'm not being funny. You put me in a water game
7656400	7662960	with you right now. Is there a multiplayer shark game where one team is like the sharks and the
7662960	7668080	others are the divers? I'm going to need to look into it. Maybe we can play that as a streamstank
7668080	7679040	game. I'm a really good swimmer. I want to take up swimming again, actually. Okay, well, I messed
7679200	7688400	up already. It's fine. I didn't want to be first place anyway. No, no, I'm not taking it personally.
7689280	7694720	Oh, you can fall off the map in this road. Okay, I'm going to be a Sunday driver
7697120	7703360	because I didn't... Are we on a space station? You know, the maps are getting a bit extreme,
7703440	7710480	map that I've met. A bit extreme for my liking, you know. Oh, we did a little stun pose. Yeah,
7714080	7719040	this map is crazy. Yeah, fuck you. I'm going for a knee. Sorry, your team blue. Get right team
7719040	7726720	blue. No, no, no. Yes. No, not the red though. Not the red though. So much for auto turning.
7726720	7731680	The game said, no, you're not getting it. Okay, that was so lucky that little bump pad thing was
7731680	7740400	there or I was a goner. I'm not going to lie. My steering is terrible. I got saved by bumping into
7740400	7754480	that. What is he holding? I'm so scared to go past him. Okay, can I even... I can? Oh, right. Oh,
7754480	7759120	right. Hold on a minute. Oh my god, both me and Roon are actually trashed. Sorry, Roon, to pick on
7759120	7764640	you, but literally both me and you are doing the exact same mistake. Right, hold on. All right, okay,
7764640	7769120	okay, okay, okay, okay. Okay, okay, okay. Let's do it. Let's do it. Let's do it. Let's do it.
7771040	7774560	Oh my god, right. As long as I'm in front of Roon and sauce, but you're actually my competitor.
7774560	7782000	No, no, he got a bullet. He got a bullet. Why did I not get a bullet? Oh my god, this map is so hard
7782080	7792080	for no reason. I'm stuck. Okay, right. No, it's fine. I didn't want to be... I don't want to rank
7792080	7797280	anyway. I didn't even want to finish this map. Of course I want to do not finish. Did not finish,
7797280	7805120	bro. Bro, please give me another bullet. I need all the help I can get. Are you serious?
7806080	7812480	No, I can't use this one on this map. Breastrokes with Strony.
7816480	7823680	Sorry, this map. I'm so sorry, teammates. I hope you're carrying. This map is impossible. I can't
7823680	7832400	do it. I honestly can't do it. My freaking baby mobile is just... Bro, it's no happening.
7832720	7835520	Yeah, I need two bullets, please.
7837840	7845520	I've got one, and then I'm going to lightening everyone. Sorry if I just got you, but you're
7845520	7851040	getting annihilated. Wait, I've got another bullet. Maybe I can become 11. Maybe I can do 11th
7851040	7859120	place. That's right, bro. Suck it. Suck it, bro. Take it. Take it like a giveaway fun. I'm not
7859840	7864320	Did we win? Oh my god, it's so close. Did we win?
7867760	7868480	Did we win?
7871280	7873280	Did we win? Is there one more?
7875920	7886000	Oh my god, we won! We won! Yay! Thank you, teammates. Thank you, KK9Grey, Dreal, Yoshi, Feathers,
7886080	7889040	Diablo. We did it! We actually won!
7891360	7895600	This game, I was getting more mushrooms than the Navali or Maros.
7896720	7903280	Are you okay, Brian? Oh my god, Brian. Are you okay? He really struggled. Oh my god, the only time
7903280	7914320	I win is by cheating. Thank you, Reeflings. Thank you, Anonymous. Wait, I'm going to get Brian to
7914320	7918080	replay that because I don't know why he said it like that. He was really not feeling it.
7919520	7924960	Are you squiddling right now? Are you trying again, Brian? This damn game, I was getting more
7924960	7931200	mushrooms than the Navali or Maros. The Navali or Maros? Thank you, Brian. Thank you, Anonymous,
7931200	7937520	for the tip. True, real 4K. I'm really literally greeting right now. I'll literally beat you up.
7937520	7943120	I'm so sorry. I got the least amount of points, but at least Momay is happy. Yeah, I'll get you
7943120	7949200	next time. Wait, how did you do that animation? How did I do that? I'll get you next time.
7950320	7957120	I'll get you next time. That's so unfair. I'll get you next time. I'll get you next time. I'll
7957120	7963200	like that. Never happier to be being also the game you ask is the one called Truck Versus Divers
7963200	7969840	and the game is called Depps. Oh, we might look into that. Velo Marios. Honestly, my first
7969920	7975520	time playing, I don't care if I win or lose. That was so good. That was literally so good.
7975520	7980000	I'm so happy with that ending. Literally, I lose the entire time, but right at the end,
7980000	7986320	refling, clutch it up for me feels good, Mom. Don't mean to fudge you. Don't mean to fudge you.
7986320	7995600	Right, where's my customization? Who's streaming? Is Emmy? Oh, AC's live still? Okay, we're going
7995600	8002000	to redirect into AC. I never get this opportunity. Okay, we're redirecting into AC. Get ready for a
8002000	8007840	party because she's doing karaoke. Thank you again so much, Reflings, for hanging out with me. You
8007840	8020240	get one big wet water kiss, okay? You like that, didn't you? I did my best. Good refling. Okay,
8020240	8024640	I see you, Giffy Gibbers, tomorrow for crying stream. Apparently, we're just crying tomorrow,
8024640	8028560	so yay, we have fun at that. Okay, bye-bye, Reflings, kiss, kiss,
8030000	8037920	enjoy ACiCle. We never get to read into ACiCle. AC time, AC time.
