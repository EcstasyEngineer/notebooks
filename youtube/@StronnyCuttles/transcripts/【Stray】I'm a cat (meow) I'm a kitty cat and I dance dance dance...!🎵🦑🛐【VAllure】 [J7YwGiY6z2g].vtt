WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:04.380
Hey?

00:04.380 --> 00:10.700
I'm a dreamer even though we're a kitty cat.

00:10.700 --> 00:12.480
Cat, I'm a kitty cat.

00:12.480 --> 00:17.400
Cat, I'm a kitty cat.

00:17.400 --> 00:18.400
And I meow, meow, meow.

00:18.400 --> 00:19.500
And I meow, meow, meow.

00:19.500 --> 00:22.180
Cat, I'm a kitty cat, and I dance, dance, dance.

00:22.180 --> 00:23.580
And I dance, dance, dance.

00:23.580 --> 00:26.320
Cat, I'm a kitty cat.

00:26.320 --> 00:27.620
Cat, I'm a kitty cat.

00:27.620 --> 00:32.620
You guys remember that hit viral YouTube video where the song goes

00:32.620 --> 00:34.620
I'm a cat, me and I'm a kitty cat

00:34.620 --> 00:37.120
And I dance and dance and dance and dance and dance

00:37.120 --> 00:39.120
Yeah, well I remember anyway

00:40.620 --> 00:44.120
I don't know if it might be better for me to play games like in the middle of the screen

00:44.120 --> 00:48.120
I feel like I'll always cover up something important over here

00:49.120 --> 00:52.620
But then I end up getting really tiny, but then if I'm here, it's like well

00:52.620 --> 00:54.620
At least I can show my face

00:55.620 --> 00:59.620
I can't feel my face when I'm open

00:59.620 --> 01:00.620
Heart or heart?

01:00.620 --> 01:02.620
Okay, let me explain the hearts

01:02.620 --> 01:05.620
I did a bit of, did a bit of work, yeah

01:05.620 --> 01:06.620
Did a bit of work

01:06.620 --> 01:08.620
So you may notice

01:08.620 --> 01:09.620
Good morning

01:09.620 --> 01:12.620
Good evening

01:12.620 --> 01:14.620
Or good afternoon

01:14.620 --> 01:16.620
I'm your host

01:16.620 --> 01:18.620
Strony Cuttos

01:19.620 --> 01:24.620
Let's get right into the updates

01:24.620 --> 01:27.620
Which is hardly any, there's not that much interesting stuff

01:27.620 --> 01:32.620
If you are a member of any viewer member, you may notice that there's hearts

01:32.620 --> 01:33.620
What do the hearts mean?

01:33.620 --> 01:37.620
The hearts are placeholders for where emotes are going to go

01:37.620 --> 01:42.620
YouTube is slightly, slightly

01:42.620 --> 01:45.620
A little bit, dare I say, a bit based

01:45.620 --> 01:51.620
You cannot lose an emotes slot if you bagzian, okay

01:51.620 --> 01:56.620
I'm gonna hope that bagzian is a terminology

01:57.620 --> 02:01.620
Used by anyone else outside of Scotland

02:01.620 --> 02:04.620
But bagzian means it is reserved, if you will

02:04.620 --> 02:06.620
My new favourite emotes just dropped, okay

02:07.620 --> 02:10.620
Can we keep one heart or moe?

02:11.620 --> 02:16.620
Although I think me holding the heart and moe is better than just an emote

02:16.620 --> 02:19.620
Bro, I can't even fucking png them

02:19.620 --> 02:24.620
But anyway, if you are a member of any girls channel, you will notice that there's moe slots

02:24.620 --> 02:28.620
And depending on how many hearts you see is how many slots unlocked

02:28.620 --> 02:32.620
AC for example is the first girl to receive her batch

02:32.620 --> 02:34.620
So hers is already up

02:34.620 --> 02:37.620
Emmys is the next to receive her batch

02:37.620 --> 02:39.620
There was a bit of a miscommunication error

02:39.620 --> 02:44.620
And by miscommunication error, they just randomly didn't draw one of the emotes we requested

02:44.620 --> 02:49.620
And drew one of the emotes we already, like redrew one of the emotes we already had

02:49.620 --> 02:51.620
And they were like, here's your delivery

02:51.620 --> 02:57.620
And I was like, no, no, no, no, that's not what my little sister wanted

02:57.620 --> 03:00.620
And that has to be, I'm glad she caught it actually

03:00.620 --> 03:03.620
I sent it to Emmys and I was like, how does it look?

03:03.620 --> 03:04.620
Are you happy with it?

03:04.620 --> 03:09.620
And she's like, strongy, there's an entire emote missing

03:09.620 --> 03:13.620
And one we didn't ask for, and I'm like, you know what Emmys?

03:13.620 --> 03:19.620
Even though you have negative 5 prescription, you've got some bloody good eyes on you sometimes for spotting

03:19.620 --> 03:22.620
Eh, oh did you hear my caller?

03:22.620 --> 03:27.620
Hi, hi, hello, hello

03:27.620 --> 03:29.620
I can't go anywhere

03:29.620 --> 03:34.620
Um, updates

03:34.620 --> 03:38.620
There's a new AC short, there's a new short on my channel

03:38.620 --> 03:40.620
There's a new short on Mercy's channel

03:40.620 --> 03:45.620
Um, Azura's got 4 shorts that have been ordered

03:45.620 --> 03:49.620
One of them is absolutely outrageous and hilarious

03:49.620 --> 03:55.620
Um, I had to get a serial box commissioned for it

03:55.620 --> 03:57.620
It was that funny

03:57.620 --> 04:00.620
Um, so hopefully when that comes out, I'll send Azura's way

04:00.620 --> 04:05.620
Cause Purser and Sheebie haven't had any shorts love

04:05.620 --> 04:10.620
But finally, the shorts are working out and you know, people are ready to work on them

04:10.620 --> 04:14.620
Oh Anonymous tipped me, hold on a minute, we have missed your tipped Anonymous

04:14.620 --> 04:16.620
Give us the tip

04:16.620 --> 04:20.620
Are you squiddin' me right now?

04:20.620 --> 04:24.620
Thank you for giving us so many streams to share with you

04:24.620 --> 04:28.620
Some of us are less active, but no less appreciative of how much you do

04:28.620 --> 04:34.620
Ah, don't you worry, you bumberino, gibberino, schnibberino, woobberino

04:34.620 --> 04:38.620
Anonymous, you don't have to fucking look

04:38.620 --> 04:42.620
I know it's not easy to keep up with me every single day, you know

04:42.620 --> 04:45.620
For mummies got endurance, the way we like it around here, okay?

04:45.620 --> 04:48.620
Thank you very much for the tip, that's very kind of you

04:48.620 --> 04:50.620
And yes, I'm glad you can enjoy the daily content

04:50.620 --> 04:56.620
Speaking of daily content, uh...

04:56.620 --> 05:01.620
We're still on for daily streams, that's the good news

05:01.620 --> 05:06.620
We're having a few health issues, okay?

05:06.620 --> 05:11.620
So currently, oh I just realized I'm linking the ACSR

05:11.620 --> 05:15.620
We're currently having some mild issues with health

05:15.620 --> 05:21.620
That is, I basically, I go for a nap for four hours when I finish a stream

05:21.620 --> 05:28.620
And then four hours before a stream, I'm having a nap, I'm not having a full sleep

05:28.620 --> 05:34.620
And I had a dream about a VTuber that I haven't even met and don't exist before

05:34.620 --> 05:39.620
So the lines are getting crossed, I'm fucking dreaming about VTubers

05:39.620 --> 05:41.620
That aren't even real!

05:41.620 --> 05:45.620
I'm gonna start fighting real sh- I'm doing Shadow Boxing for real

05:45.620 --> 05:51.620
In my head, in my head, in my head

05:51.620 --> 05:55.620
Is it Army? Army, Army

05:55.620 --> 05:59.620
I don't know what that song is

05:59.620 --> 06:02.620
So I'm starting to hallucinate a wee bit

06:02.620 --> 06:05.620
Not quite at the hallucinatory stage, however

06:05.620 --> 06:09.620
I am really struggling to wake up for streams

06:09.620 --> 06:13.620
But my only other alternative option

06:13.620 --> 06:16.620
Oh is it Zombie? No, what did I say? Army

06:16.620 --> 06:22.620
Zombie, in my head, in my head

06:22.620 --> 06:27.620
Zombie, zombie

06:27.620 --> 06:29.620
Anyway, whilst I'm being distracted

06:29.620 --> 06:30.620
We're playing a game called Stray

06:30.620 --> 06:33.620
Apparently it takes five hours to do this game

06:33.620 --> 06:36.620
Everyone went absolutely coconuts when this game dropped

06:36.620 --> 06:38.620
I personally have not played it before

06:38.620 --> 06:39.620
But it's got cats in it

06:39.620 --> 06:41.620
And you know how we do around these parts

06:41.620 --> 06:44.620
If you didn't know, Wham and Love It

06:44.620 --> 06:48.620
When men like creatures or lesser beings

06:48.620 --> 06:50.620
Because it shows that man is safe

06:50.620 --> 06:53.620
If man does not like creature or lesser being

06:53.620 --> 06:54.620
Man is not safe

06:54.620 --> 06:56.620
Hmm, Monca es

06:56.620 --> 07:00.620
But apparently we get to be a yin-yor cat

07:00.620 --> 07:03.620
As well, not just any kind of cat, a yin-yor

07:03.620 --> 07:06.620
Five hours if you're quick

07:06.620 --> 07:08.620
Oh no

07:08.620 --> 07:10.620
Oh my god

07:10.620 --> 07:12.620
Why are we so skinny?

07:12.620 --> 07:14.620
We need to fatten us up

07:14.620 --> 07:16.620
Where's your primordial pouch?

07:16.620 --> 07:18.620
Oh my god

07:18.620 --> 07:20.620
Hello

07:20.620 --> 07:22.620
Oh actually, I'm ginger

07:22.620 --> 07:24.620
Wait, whoa, that camera's a bit...

07:24.620 --> 07:26.620
Oh my god, Mia

07:26.620 --> 07:27.620
Do you jump?

07:27.620 --> 07:28.620
Jump

07:28.620 --> 07:29.620
No

07:30.620 --> 07:32.620
Oh no

07:32.620 --> 07:33.620
Hello

07:33.620 --> 07:34.620
Oh my god

07:34.620 --> 07:36.620
It's Chateau Noir

07:36.620 --> 07:39.620
Bonjour Chateau Noir

07:39.620 --> 07:40.620
Hello

07:45.620 --> 07:47.620
Oh, I'm the submissive cat

07:47.620 --> 07:48.620
Do you know why?

07:48.620 --> 07:49.620
Because I got licked on the face

07:49.620 --> 07:51.620
So I'm the submissive putter

07:51.620 --> 07:52.620
Okay, ginger is the submissive

07:52.620 --> 07:54.620
Hey, but you're a mix

07:54.620 --> 07:57.620
You're a calico-colo-colo-lolo cat

07:58.620 --> 07:59.620
Oh, we're all playing

07:59.620 --> 08:01.620
Yeah, we buddy

08:03.620 --> 08:06.620
Oh, we're getting a little scent marking

08:06.620 --> 08:08.620
On that one

08:08.620 --> 08:09.620
Hello

08:10.620 --> 08:13.620
Oh my god

08:13.620 --> 08:15.620
Oh, I'm the submissive one

08:15.620 --> 08:16.620
Out of all of them

08:16.620 --> 08:17.620
I guess the runt is a litter

08:17.620 --> 08:19.620
That's okay

08:22.620 --> 08:25.620
Oh my god, are we going to sleep as a family?

08:25.620 --> 08:28.620
Oh, can I come join?

08:28.620 --> 08:33.620
Oh my god, we can sleep together as a family

08:35.620 --> 08:38.620
Oh my god

08:38.620 --> 08:40.620
I loved this game already

08:40.620 --> 08:43.620
Cat-fine box, sitting box

08:43.620 --> 08:44.620
Yeah

08:44.620 --> 08:47.620
But yes, the love hearts are going to get swapped out

08:47.620 --> 08:50.620
Oh, look at Mia, old ginger and stuff

08:50.620 --> 08:52.620
I'm ginger tabby

08:52.620 --> 08:54.620
Aw, yeah, look at my ginger tabby

08:55.620 --> 08:58.620
It's a booty fly

09:02.620 --> 09:04.620
Oh, we're flicking her ear

09:04.620 --> 09:06.620
That's so cute

09:06.620 --> 09:09.620
Tell me if the game is a bit too loud, okay?

09:09.620 --> 09:13.620
Because you know me, terrible for balancing my voice

09:13.620 --> 09:15.620
And then in-game audio

09:16.620 --> 09:19.620
Oh, let me sip my tea

09:20.620 --> 09:23.620
Remember that time I read out everyone's interview

09:23.620 --> 09:27.620
On acapella media in a magazine

09:27.620 --> 09:29.620
Because they were kind enough to let them interview us

09:29.620 --> 09:32.620
And let us be like the front page of it and everything

09:32.620 --> 09:34.620
And then proceeded to talk

09:34.620 --> 09:36.620
Proceeded to celebrate a refund

09:36.620 --> 09:38.620
Giving me a bit but of 21 times

09:38.620 --> 09:40.620
Yeah, god, I remember

09:40.620 --> 09:41.620
Jeez, I'm so sorry

09:41.620 --> 09:44.620
Please continue to talk to us

09:46.620 --> 09:47.620
Fucking

09:47.620 --> 09:50.620
I will say one thing, acapella media were like

09:50.620 --> 09:52.620
At the end of it

09:52.620 --> 09:54.620
They were like

09:54.620 --> 09:57.620
If you've got any other news you'd like to report on

09:57.620 --> 09:58.620
Please let us know

09:58.620 --> 10:00.620
And I'm like, oh my god, that's so kind

10:00.620 --> 10:01.620
What the heck?

10:01.620 --> 10:03.620
So we can literally submit like

10:03.620 --> 10:05.620
Interests and stuff that's happening

10:05.620 --> 10:07.620
Which is really nice

10:07.620 --> 10:08.620
Like they were so nice

10:08.620 --> 10:09.620
Like shout out to them

10:09.620 --> 10:11.620
Because they weren't like, eee

10:11.620 --> 10:13.620
Your whole bags were no interview

10:13.620 --> 10:14.620
And you were not in getaway

10:14.620 --> 10:15.620
Eee

10:15.620 --> 10:16.620
Beee

10:16.620 --> 10:18.620
They weren't like that

10:18.620 --> 10:20.620
They were just like, ah, it's a girl

10:20.620 --> 10:22.620
Oh my god, we're so agile

10:25.620 --> 10:27.620
Now, don't get me wrong

10:27.620 --> 10:31.620
I don't want to say my perceptions off or anything

10:31.620 --> 10:33.620
But either no humans are here

10:33.620 --> 10:36.620
Or we're post-apocalyptic cause

10:36.620 --> 10:38.620
Oh, chateau noir

10:38.620 --> 10:40.620
Bonjour, chateau noir

10:40.620 --> 10:43.620
Comment tu t'appelles?

10:43.620 --> 10:45.620
Oh, we're zooming in

10:45.620 --> 10:47.620
Oh, those are spiky concrete

10:47.620 --> 10:49.620
Steel bars and concrete

10:49.620 --> 10:51.620
Um, well, give me a second

10:51.620 --> 10:53.620
I'm drinking my tea though

10:54.620 --> 10:55.620
What happens?

10:55.620 --> 10:57.620
Can we like explore areas and stuff?

10:57.620 --> 10:58.620
Or is it alpha?

10:58.620 --> 11:00.620
Oh, alpha to jump

11:00.620 --> 11:01.620
Okay, wee

11:01.620 --> 11:02.620
Alright, stop

11:02.620 --> 11:03.620
Stop me on

11:04.620 --> 11:05.620
Stop me on

11:07.620 --> 11:08.620
Alright, go on

11:08.620 --> 11:09.620
Let's go

11:09.620 --> 11:10.620
Ta-da, men

11:10.620 --> 11:11.620
I'm trying to finish my tea

11:11.620 --> 11:13.620
The camera's like quite snappy

11:13.620 --> 11:14.620
I don't know if that makes any sense

11:14.620 --> 11:15.620
Press Bravo

11:17.620 --> 11:18.620
I'm barking with B

11:20.620 --> 11:21.620
Hello

11:21.620 --> 11:22.620
Are we French cats?

11:22.620 --> 11:23.620
No, the black one's French

11:23.620 --> 11:25.620
He's called Chat Noir

11:25.620 --> 11:26.620
Wherever he is

11:26.620 --> 11:27.620
There he is

11:27.620 --> 11:29.620
That's Chat Noir

11:29.620 --> 11:30.620
Oh, my God

11:30.620 --> 11:31.620
That's Chat Noir

There's a clown coming out of the yo-yo

01:06:05.040 --> 01:06:11.120
What is this information the tree is a scientific marvel

01:06:12.640 --> 01:06:15.280
It's remarkable that human ingenuity

01:06:15.760 --> 01:06:21.280
Found a way to create plants that thrive out sunlight organic life requires trees to purify to set you there

01:06:21.360 --> 01:06:25.200
We both don't need it, but they take care of them anyway. It's what the humans would have wanted. Oh

01:06:25.760 --> 01:06:27.760
Uh

01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:42.000
Can I come right here? Hey, I want to go through this door. No, okay. He doesn't care. Um

01:06:44.240 --> 01:06:47.840
So you'll fix something for us

01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:59.040
Sorry, I just trashed in your house. Um, there was a fizzy just next to the lad. Okay, hold on

01:07:00.640 --> 01:07:02.640
Uh

01:07:03.360 --> 01:07:05.840
Oh, it was just oh it was just junk stuff

01:07:09.680 --> 01:07:12.720
Uh, do you mean the lad upstairs?

01:07:13.680 --> 01:07:19.520
Hey mom, it's dusk here and I might pass out. You you're allowed to fall asleep. I'm worried

01:07:22.080 --> 01:07:26.080
God everyone likes caz up like the wee holiday destinations here translate

01:07:27.600 --> 01:07:29.600
We were programmed to be slaves, but since

01:07:32.160 --> 01:07:37.840
Many a year we have a soul hope one day the outsiders will find the exit of the town or more

01:07:38.160 --> 01:07:40.160
I

01:07:40.560 --> 01:07:42.720
Think all the sodas just come out of end of machines

01:07:45.200 --> 01:07:46.880
Yeah

01:07:46.880 --> 01:07:50.400
Let's say benzene on it benzene. Oh, that's right upstairs

01:07:51.200 --> 01:07:54.960
Right. We have something that can repair stuff for us

01:07:55.440 --> 01:08:00.400
Right. We'll go back to the music guy. I want back out. Please. Please. Let me outside

01:08:02.960 --> 01:08:04.960
Thank you next door

01:08:05.840 --> 01:08:09.840
Thank you very much. Um

01:08:11.680 --> 01:08:13.680
Right, it looks like I need to go up now

01:08:15.040 --> 01:08:16.640
Um

01:08:16.640 --> 01:08:19.280
Maybe back to the pain guys. Maybe they've moved

01:08:21.120 --> 01:08:24.720
Yeah, you don't say anything to me. Do you look like uh, yeah, that's okay

01:08:26.320 --> 01:08:29.360
Okay, that's fine. Uh, right up up up. How'd I get up again?

01:08:30.640 --> 01:08:32.640
Like literally anywhere, I guess

01:08:32.880 --> 01:08:36.640
Let's have a go. This looks like that. Yeah, let's go

01:08:39.280 --> 01:08:42.320
All the way the number of days ended up being

01:08:44.240 --> 01:08:47.360
That's quite a while. Yeah, I'm not surprised

01:08:50.640 --> 01:08:52.320
Uh, right

01:08:52.320 --> 01:08:57.360
the youtuber throwing pain until I uh intervene sorry about that

01:08:58.480 --> 01:09:00.480
Let's see what's up here

01:09:01.440 --> 01:09:04.320
We've got a bucket from here

01:09:07.440 --> 01:09:09.440
Huh

01:09:09.520 --> 01:09:11.520
um

01:09:12.800 --> 01:09:16.480
I need so the programmer can can I not go up here?

01:09:18.800 --> 01:09:22.400
Game said no you can do as much else as you want but that's too far

01:09:23.040 --> 01:09:25.520
Uh, right. What's over here?

01:09:25.760 --> 01:09:27.760
Okay

01:09:35.840 --> 01:09:40.880
Have I spoken to those guys? I don't think so. I don't want to take that in case it's like

01:09:40.960 --> 01:09:46.000
Going the wrong way and have to climb all the way back up. Do you have another music sheet?

01:09:46.080 --> 01:09:48.880
Oh, I don't know if I've got another song in me. Will we try it?

01:09:51.520 --> 01:09:54.160
I definitely need to get up there, but how'd I get up there?

01:09:55.520 --> 01:09:57.520
I don't know

01:09:57.520 --> 01:10:02.160
Have I spoken to these two guys at the fire? I don't recall speaking to the guys at the fire

01:10:07.200 --> 01:10:09.200
I thought there's a light here

01:10:13.760 --> 01:10:15.760
I'm in someone's who's

01:10:20.800 --> 01:10:22.800
The robot

01:10:23.600 --> 01:10:26.100
The music just changed

01:10:33.520 --> 01:10:35.520
Huh

01:10:35.840 --> 01:10:37.840
I'm definitely in the right place

01:10:39.760 --> 01:10:43.280
Have I heard the music changed any music changers?

01:10:44.160 --> 01:10:46.160
Oh

01:10:46.400 --> 01:10:50.400
Take a notebook. Sure. Um, that's theft but also

01:10:51.120 --> 01:10:55.120
A strange notebook with a symbol on it. This one seems to belong to someone named climbing time

01:10:55.600 --> 01:10:58.080
Everything is going according to plan. We've managed to

01:10:59.280 --> 01:11:00.240
I can't read that fast

01:11:00.240 --> 01:11:06.160
We managed to contact the upper level before the trans receiver went down. They are in a place called midtown

01:11:06.240 --> 01:11:12.560
Apparently it's controlled by some kind of oppressive force. I talked to Momo earlier his eyes. I know his look

01:11:12.560 --> 01:11:16.240
He will not come with us. I don't know what this means, but it'll probably be useful for there

01:11:16.560 --> 01:11:21.840
We should go see the Momo person. I'm trying but I keep not walking into him

01:11:22.640 --> 01:11:24.640
Okay, so there's like tons of

01:11:25.920 --> 01:11:27.920
Okay, we've got two songs to go

01:11:30.320 --> 01:11:32.320
Okay, we'll go speak to the musician

01:11:34.400 --> 01:11:37.760
Uh, right how do I get down safely? How do I get down?

01:11:40.720 --> 01:11:42.720
Let's go down

01:11:43.680 --> 01:11:49.440
Gently easy easy. Right. Where's the music guy? Uh

01:11:52.480 --> 01:11:54.480
Nope, this is the wrong way

01:11:55.280 --> 01:11:59.920
Okay, I'm just gonna sing secret tunnel for one of them. It doesn't even count

01:12:00.960 --> 01:12:02.960
Two kittens

01:12:03.840 --> 01:12:05.840
Forbidden from one another

01:12:06.720 --> 01:12:10.400
Their parents debate their people

01:12:11.360 --> 01:12:16.800
Yes, I'm fine more. You'll never guess what I have on my person. Okay, we have three. Okay, let's do three

01:12:18.480 --> 01:12:22.000
Untitled the tune contains 44 notes

01:12:33.600 --> 01:12:37.680
You're gonna need to let them cook on that one ask them to do Wonderwall

01:12:40.800 --> 01:12:48.640
I'm not sure I can do this one. This one's probably the closest one to me not gonna lie

01:12:49.360 --> 01:12:51.040
Uh

01:12:51.040 --> 01:12:53.840
Oh, thank you for the music practice. Yeah. Yeah. I've got one more

01:12:55.680 --> 01:12:59.520
Cool down. Okay. Okay. Okay. Cool down. We've got a prompt

01:13:02.080 --> 01:13:04.080
It's a hot

01:13:05.040 --> 01:13:08.720
It's a hot summer day and a feeling okay

01:13:09.120 --> 01:13:16.320
And the air is going through my hair and killing me then and it feels real nice to be

01:13:16.800 --> 01:13:20.560
Our cat in town. Oh, I feel so good

01:13:21.440 --> 01:13:29.440
And it feels so nice and the sun is shining and feels alive and I'm going

01:13:30.240 --> 01:13:36.960
And it's going great because I'm a cool cat on a hot summer day

01:13:38.720 --> 01:13:40.720
Oh

01:13:59.680 --> 01:14:06.160
He's gone. Oh, he's gone. Hey. Hey fuck him up. Hey. Hey. Hey fuck him up. Hey

01:14:08.720 --> 01:14:10.720
Hey

01:14:12.800 --> 01:14:14.800
We did it uncle

01:14:17.680 --> 01:14:22.560
Okay, we did it right now we should actually probably progress the mission now

01:14:23.280 --> 01:14:25.280
um

01:14:25.600 --> 01:14:31.760
In the moment give him an animal right go. Sorry go to this freaking guy. Sorry. He's up right. Let's go upstairs

01:14:32.720 --> 01:14:35.520
Because I keep I have no idea where I'm actually going

01:14:36.480 --> 01:14:41.840
I love this goofy siren. Like just because you can't sing doesn't mean shouldn't you know what I'm saying?

01:14:43.120 --> 01:14:45.120
Right again pink guys

01:14:47.040 --> 01:14:49.040
Um

01:14:52.160 --> 01:14:55.840
Uh, right I'm just checking. Oh wait

01:14:57.840 --> 01:15:02.240
Wait the elevator doesn't work, but that's where I'm supposed to go. Huh

01:15:02.960 --> 01:15:04.960
Yeah

01:15:05.280 --> 01:15:07.780
Right I went into that hidden room

01:15:09.120 --> 01:15:11.600
There's a bucket and I'm up

01:15:13.040 --> 01:15:18.080
Why do you have to rune horse in moments and I'm gonna give him an animal because it's my earworm. I've got it stuck in my head

01:15:19.840 --> 01:15:21.840
Why or how?

01:15:23.760 --> 01:15:26.720
Okay, let's go this let's go dead ahead this time

01:15:27.680 --> 01:15:34.240
And that chair was spinning on an axis I go dead ahead. Can I like do a wraparound?

01:15:35.200 --> 01:15:37.200
Maybe

01:15:37.360 --> 01:15:39.360
Don't ray him off now. Oh, hello

01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:43.040
Oh, are you an elderly robot? Hi old man

01:15:44.960 --> 01:15:49.200
Oh, hey, it's you you do look weird and small, but there's something about your old chap

01:15:49.600 --> 01:15:53.440
I feel compelled to pet you, but I won't because I don't understand why

01:15:54.240 --> 01:16:00.240
Oh, yeah, you want to pet me? I'm uh, oh, I can't pet. I can't get a pet. Okay. You can pet me in another way

01:16:01.280 --> 01:16:03.280

01:16:04.320 --> 01:16:06.320
I ran you in make it better

01:16:06.960 --> 01:16:08.080
Hello

That's right. I'm I'm taping in the court that one. We got so juice

01:16:13.600 --> 01:16:17.280
Okay, we get an energy drink. I guess the robots can have energy drink

01:16:18.080 --> 01:16:20.080
Okay

01:16:23.040 --> 01:16:29.440
Oh, it is TV bonk. I press the big button

01:16:33.680 --> 01:16:37.920
You know, maybe sometimes TV sometimes or maybe she sometimes or maybe good

01:16:39.760 --> 01:16:41.760
News channel

01:16:42.800 --> 01:16:45.200
Uh, are you going to need nature documentaries?

01:16:46.160 --> 01:16:49.600
Oh my god, the robot's really straight up doing TV. That's horrible

01:16:51.760 --> 01:16:54.560
Oh, I see it. I see it. I see

01:16:57.040 --> 01:16:59.040
Please tell me I finally did it

01:17:00.400 --> 01:17:02.400
Is this where I'm supposed to go?

01:17:03.600 --> 01:17:08.800
I know it's playing the mysterious music again. I'm just getting that freaking document or something

01:17:09.520 --> 01:17:11.520
Translate

01:17:12.880 --> 01:17:16.480
Hey doc, I found the keys to the safe. You need to be more careful with these

01:17:17.920 --> 01:17:24.000
It's not enough to bury the safe behind a bunch of books the librarian. Okay. Well, we have our heading

01:17:25.040 --> 01:17:27.040
behind books

01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:30.000
There's a lot of books

01:17:30.720 --> 01:17:32.720
This is a lot

01:17:35.760 --> 01:17:37.760
There's too many books in here

01:17:39.360 --> 01:17:43.200
I was like properly in the library. So is there something I can interact with?

01:17:46.160 --> 01:17:51.520
Stealing time it's not stealing I see I see I see and give him a snowbreak. Oh, no

01:17:52.400 --> 01:17:57.840
It's there is how to develop your artificial intelligence in order to be creative as a real human volume

01:17:58.560 --> 01:18:00.560
I see rain. Hi, I see

01:18:01.440 --> 01:18:04.720
And um, uh, uh, sorry music time. He don't mind for no

01:18:04.880 --> 01:18:06.880
Oh

01:18:08.960 --> 01:18:14.880
Everybody wants to be a cat because the cat's the only cat that knows

01:18:16.160 --> 01:18:19.360
Hi snowberries. What were you up to you hooligans today?

01:18:20.240 --> 01:18:22.560
There'll be no more landing a train

01:18:24.640 --> 01:18:30.080
A I can't figure out where the safe is unfortunately

01:18:30.320 --> 01:18:37.600
Did you guys like aces news short? Yeah. Oh, I found it. Uh, this one, please

01:18:39.520 --> 01:18:42.320
What is it take

01:18:44.480 --> 01:18:48.400
The strange notebook with the symbol on it you're watching cartoons. Oh, that's so good

01:18:49.200 --> 01:18:51.200
I actually have aces

01:18:51.520 --> 01:18:56.240
Short linked if you want to literally listen to her laughing in the background like a maniac

01:18:56.960 --> 01:19:01.680
Uh, it's a strange notebook with a symbol on it. This one seems to belong to someone named the dog

01:19:04.400 --> 01:19:06.960
After weeks of research I've confined a spectrum

01:19:07.440 --> 01:19:12.880
Spectrometer with a powerful UV lamp with this it should be capable of warding the off dessert

01:19:13.840 --> 01:19:18.000
The initial attempt was explosive. I might have to test on the real conditions

01:19:18.560 --> 01:19:22.000
I don't know what this means, but I'll probably be useful later

01:19:22.560 --> 01:19:29.280
We should go see that momo person who guardian tool. I'm trying. I keep going everywhere but him

01:19:29.440 --> 01:19:31.440
I don't know where he is

01:19:31.520 --> 01:19:33.520
please

01:19:34.320 --> 01:19:36.800
The ac weas classic on his blue

01:19:38.080 --> 01:19:42.400
Right, so I got a thing from being in here. So how do I get out again?

01:19:44.240 --> 01:19:45.760
Oh, okay

01:19:45.760 --> 01:19:47.760
There's something on the shelf there

01:19:47.840 --> 01:19:49.840
What is that?

01:19:52.400 --> 01:19:54.400
What's on the shelf over here?

01:19:55.760 --> 01:19:57.680
I see it

01:19:57.680 --> 01:19:59.360

Okay, we have had a cat nap

We are now going to try and get to this momo person. We've been at it for a wee hot setting now

01:20:26.640 --> 01:20:31.440
Uh, unfortunately following the light is not working for this. Um

01:20:33.040 --> 01:20:36.880
I think I just need to get higher up to like more obscure places

01:20:37.600 --> 01:20:42.400
I guess right. I've done that vending machine. Can I jump across? I can

01:20:43.360 --> 01:20:47.920

01:20:49.680 --> 01:20:51.680
No, I can

01:20:53.680 --> 01:20:55.680
I think I think I'm gonna need a

I want to say I need help, but I don't even know if you can explain where I need to go

01:21:01.280 --> 01:21:03.280
Because there's just so much

01:21:05.760 --> 01:21:09.840
I've been there I've been there have I been on top of that yet? I don't know. I don't think I have

01:21:10.720 --> 01:21:13.760
I'm just trying to go anywhere. I've not been

Another ASMR she had 9,000. Oh god my desk like just that's so bright

01:21:28.960 --> 01:21:30.960
It does look like I can go this way. Hold on

01:21:32.800 --> 01:21:37.360
Excuse me. Pardon me. Come to me. Right. So I've been in that window

01:21:38.320 --> 01:21:40.320
Which is fine

01:21:41.200 --> 01:21:44.080
No, if I can go like oh, there's

Uh, I've got two more collabs to write. Oh, this is not going well. Um, I've got two. Is this just a scratch?

01:22:00.880 --> 01:22:04.240
Let me in please let me in. I don't know where to go

01:22:05.200 --> 01:22:08.880

I've got 11 with people outside of velour. I'm going normally

01:22:37.920 --> 01:22:44.800
Um, and then I'm probably going to take a hot break on doing any clubs with anyone for a hot second

01:22:44.960 --> 01:22:50.080
11 is a lot considering I've just came flying out the gate. Okay. We're ready for a prompt

01:22:50.880 --> 01:22:54.960
Hey, I'm yeah, I'm definitely gonna focus on like meme ASMRs and solo stuff

01:22:55.680 --> 01:23:00.640
After that for a bit. Thank you. I will practice music. Do you think you can find more? I absolutely can

01:23:01.280 --> 01:23:04.640

01:23:21.040 --> 01:23:30.080
In senseless the best in the plane. I'm alone. I'm a robot and I'm in the rain and I'm sad

01:23:33.600 --> 01:23:44.880
And I don't feel glad for what I'm feeling but then again all the humans are dead and I'm kind of sad

01:23:45.200 --> 01:23:49.200
And I'm not so glad

01:23:56.000 --> 01:23:58.000
Hit him with a rover

01:23:59.200 --> 01:24:03.680
Okay, okay, that wasn't that wasn't hopefully the next one's a bit more upbeat. Okay

Other heroes here

01:24:25.920 --> 01:24:34.880
I have something I want to share and tell you it's something that I think you should care about

01:24:35.200 --> 01:24:38.880
It's an information overload in this world of

01:24:39.520 --> 01:24:48.000
Overgrown and everything inside is so looking. Okay. That was a really short one to try and come up with anything

01:24:48.080 --> 01:24:50.080
Thank you. Mr. Musician

01:24:50.400 --> 01:24:53.520
Um, unfortunately, I think I'm stuck right now. Um

01:24:55.360 --> 01:24:57.360
Kind of sounds like music from Omori

01:24:58.080 --> 01:25:01.280
Can you lay in the pillows? I think so. I think it's just a napspot

01:25:02.000 --> 01:25:04.000
I'm trying to freaking

01:25:04.560 --> 01:25:07.280
You freaking freaks. I don't know how to progress

01:25:08.880 --> 01:25:10.880
I don't know. Maybe I need to

01:25:11.280 --> 01:25:14.800
Do I have enough energy drinks for the merchant? Hold on. How many energy drinks?

01:25:16.320 --> 01:25:23.120
One two, right, so I don't have enough for whatever the merchants hiding so maybe that's what I need to get access to normal

01:25:24.720 --> 01:25:26.720
I don't know

01:25:27.680 --> 01:25:29.680
Uh

01:25:30.400 --> 01:25:36.320
How'd it go? No, that's down close enough. I was one way or another honestly. You're doing great. Keep it up

01:25:36.400 --> 01:25:40.800
Sweet. Oh, and we're going down again. Okay. It's fine. It's fine. I didn't need to go. Okay. It's fine. I didn't need to go up

01:25:41.680 --> 01:25:43.440
uh

01:25:43.440 --> 01:25:47.440
I like writing songs in my spare time. So I'm come up. I'm jealous you can come up with lyrics on the spot

01:25:48.400 --> 01:25:54.160
I'm just going for it. Literally. It gives me a prompt. I'm not even rhyming properly. You're just being nice to me

01:25:55.120 --> 01:25:57.520
Actually, I'm not even rhyming and I'm just like

01:25:59.520 --> 01:26:03.280
That's me. Right. Okay. So that's me more right. How'd I get up?

01:26:04.160 --> 01:26:08.160
I was kind of coming down from here. I've already been this way, right?

01:26:10.320 --> 01:26:14.720
Sorry, it's probably have I been in here? Uh, this is the top of the bar

01:26:16.480 --> 01:26:18.480
Oh, these are the two that I've never speak to

01:26:20.640 --> 01:26:22.480
Hello

01:26:22.560 --> 01:26:28.800
I left it in the streets and the next day the zarks consumed it. That's crazy. They can eat everything

01:26:30.000 --> 01:26:32.000
Hello, can I rub against your legs?

01:26:34.160 --> 01:26:36.160
I'm a male in your little heart

01:26:37.280 --> 01:26:41.920
Yeah, that's great. You love the pooters. What's this?

01:26:43.520 --> 01:26:48.640
Oh, is this where we're supposed to go if I actually progress the story line properly?

01:26:49.280 --> 01:26:51.280
I

01:26:51.680 --> 01:26:56.880
Shawnee trying not to fumble too hard. It's called improv. Shawnee. It's called improv. Oh, yeah

01:26:57.200 --> 01:27:01.760
You like the way that I don't rhyme because I don't have enough time to prepare for what I'm going to say next. I don't

01:27:03.280 --> 01:27:05.280
Right. I've already been in there. You can't fill me

01:27:06.080 --> 01:27:11.920
Fill me once shame on you. Fill me twice shame on you. Is anyone played straight? Am I supposed to get the third thing now?

01:27:12.880 --> 01:27:15.840
Despite what Shawnee says, she's actually a good thing, right?

01:27:15.840 --> 01:27:17.840
I really don't

01:27:37.360 --> 01:27:39.360
Wait, I'm an idiot. No

01:27:40.800 --> 01:27:42.800
Pull the other way

01:27:43.120 --> 01:27:46.640
I'm an idiot and it's been there the whole time. Am I going crazy?

01:27:48.080 --> 01:27:50.080
Wait, no, have I been here? Am I good?

01:27:57.920 --> 01:27:59.920
It's been here the whole time

01:28:00.960 --> 01:28:05.760
Oh, okay, it's fine. It's fine. It's fine. It's fine. It's fine. It's been here the whole time

01:34:52.800 --> 01:34:56.640
Chat we need to band together to mass spam bad cat puns. No

01:35:00.960 --> 01:35:03.920
Shawna got me feeling something kind of way. Yeah, I like the necklace

01:35:06.240 --> 01:35:10.880
Uh, right, there's there must be a book in here. Sorry. Wait. Whoa. What was that?

01:35:12.880 --> 01:35:14.880
Wait, it's on top of the thing

01:35:16.880 --> 01:35:20.160
Finally the last notebook this one seems to belong to Zanzaba

01:35:21.360 --> 01:35:25.200
All traces of organic life has disappeared except for what we call deserves

01:35:25.520 --> 01:35:31.840
They seem to eat almost anything that moves and breed at an inconceivable rate get it because they can see fast

01:35:33.120 --> 01:35:37.920
Uh, it's it's as if being walked in the city wasn't hard enough. Oh

01:35:38.560 --> 01:35:42.240
There's also a lot in this book. I said I found a design flaw in the transceiver

01:35:42.240 --> 01:35:46.640
But I think I figured out how to fix it. Here's the equation with this. We should be able to help

01:35:47.200 --> 01:35:53.120
Momo repair the transfer if it can communicate with the upper levels that could be our way up

01:35:54.080 --> 01:35:56.800
Let's show him what fun. Okay, baby

01:36:00.640 --> 01:36:08.080
Oh, there's a thing down there to remember. I see it. How'd I get there? Can I get done? I would like to remember

01:36:10.000 --> 01:36:12.000
Member in the memory

01:36:12.720 --> 01:36:14.720
What's this? C14

01:36:17.120 --> 01:36:20.880
Remarkable companions have evolved so much in the early days

01:36:20.960 --> 01:36:22.960
They're simple ai merely in

01:36:23.920 --> 01:36:31.120
Imitated human art now. This is all on their own humans often said that making art is important in desperate situations

01:36:31.440 --> 01:36:33.440
These are certainly desperate times

01:36:35.600 --> 01:36:37.600
Getting his memories back

01:36:38.480 --> 01:36:46.000
Uh, actually should I come back up again? I think so. Whoops. Oh, and I'm going further down. Oh, and I'm going further down still

01:36:46.080 --> 01:36:48.080
Okay, let's just uh

01:36:48.320 --> 01:36:52.720
Let's just climb up a different location. Sometimes it's a bit finicky

01:36:53.360 --> 01:36:55.360
Right, I need to go top right

01:36:57.680 --> 01:36:59.680
I've made an

01:37:01.520 --> 01:37:07.120
I have made an incredible decision. We shall band together for now. We are Legion and meow

01:37:08.320 --> 01:37:10.320
Or or is night from

01:37:11.520 --> 01:37:13.520
What are you saying?

01:37:14.080 --> 01:37:16.080
Why are you blue?

01:37:17.040 --> 01:37:20.720
I have probably gone the longest way possible to get back to this guy. Sorry

01:37:26.880 --> 01:37:28.880
Unfortunately

01:37:29.440 --> 01:37:34.560
I don't wrong. Sorry. Sorry. It was a big jump. I shouldn't have done that to you. Oh, we need to go up

01:37:36.640 --> 01:37:38.560
We're getting there

01:37:38.560 --> 01:37:42.800
It's just taking me a hot second because I'm a little slow in the head

01:37:42.960 --> 01:37:45.840
But I thank you for being patient for me reeflings

01:37:47.120 --> 01:37:53.680
Okay, let's get up up ease. Hello. I did it. I got your quest items

01:37:55.520 --> 01:37:58.720
Are you still looking for the notebook? Yes, that's all

01:38:02.000 --> 01:38:05.680
That's his notebook, right? I never quite understood what he was talking about most of the time

01:38:05.760 --> 01:38:08.720
But he was very wise. Wait, you actually found all my friends notebook

01:38:09.280 --> 01:38:16.160
Oh, what's that? No, the transfer you were can be repaired. That's incredible. That means we should be able to communicate outside of the slum

01:38:16.880 --> 01:38:18.800
Climbing time

01:38:18.800 --> 01:38:22.160
Hey Johnny. Hi chat. Hi, Broly legend. Thank you for the tip

01:38:22.800 --> 01:38:24.400
and

01:38:24.400 --> 01:38:29.040
Climbing time doc. I'm sorry. I doubted our cause. I promise you'll find a way to reach the servers

01:38:29.120 --> 01:38:33.120
Thank you. We might be able to find you a way up now. Let's fix this piece of junk trans receiver

01:38:34.720 --> 01:38:36.720
The tv

01:38:37.120 --> 01:38:39.120
Or diameter

01:38:41.520 --> 01:38:48.000
Oh wait our friend in the programming thing said he'll fix anything. Oh, wait, he just did it come with me

01:38:49.440 --> 01:38:51.440
Come with me

01:38:59.040 --> 01:39:01.040
Up there see that building high above others

01:39:01.280 --> 01:39:02.240
Yeah

01:39:02.240 --> 01:39:06.560
If you install the transceiver at the very top of that tower, you should be able to communicate to go to the city

01:39:06.720 --> 01:39:09.760
My friends might still be out there. If there's any way out, they'll know

01:39:11.360 --> 01:39:16.240
There's only one small click enough to evade the zarks. We need you a little outsider. Bring us to the sky

01:39:16.960 --> 01:39:18.960
That's kind of that lane kind of goes hard

01:39:22.320 --> 01:39:25.920
Oh no, I need to get ready to run I think

01:39:27.200 --> 01:39:29.200
Oh no

01:39:30.080 --> 01:39:32.080
I don't like it already

01:39:33.200 --> 01:39:36.000
When do they start jumping out at me? How much time do I have?

01:39:41.040 --> 01:39:47.840
Oh no, oh no, this can't be right, okay

01:39:50.160 --> 01:39:52.160
I can't even see where to go

01:39:52.160 --> 01:39:54.160
I

01:39:57.120 --> 01:40:01.760
Assume I just jump up from over there. I don't want them to grab me but we're gonna

01:40:04.160 --> 01:40:06.160
That they're trying to get their attention

01:40:11.040 --> 01:40:13.040
Okay

01:40:15.360 --> 01:40:19.600
Uh, uh, uh, can I just hold a and you go up? Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Perfect

01:40:20.240 --> 01:40:23.280
Okay, keep her going eggs bacon grits sausage

01:40:24.240 --> 01:40:26.240
Got a flat ass, but it still takes sausage

01:40:30.320 --> 01:40:32.320
Oh no

01:40:33.120 --> 01:40:37.680
Oh no, oh get me up. Just get me up. Oh my god. Oh no

01:40:39.280 --> 01:40:43.920
Oh my god, okay. Okay. What's the summer memory? Sorry. Are they chasing me?

01:40:44.080 --> 01:40:46.080
Oh

01:40:46.400 --> 01:40:50.480
I've got nine lines check. Yeah, the city is full of neon. It wasn't all this way

01:40:50.720 --> 01:40:55.760
We used to be strict energy caps, especially in the slums, but people couldn't handle the concept dodging

01:40:56.240 --> 01:41:02.240
One day someone lit up rainbow lamps neon signs all over the house that person was taken away and never seen the game

01:41:02.720 --> 01:41:08.720
Again, but people saw hope and not long after everyone started putting lots of lights in their homes

01:41:08.800 --> 01:41:10.960
There was nothing their pressers could do

01:41:11.040 --> 01:41:15.360
It was the way for people to see colors again like on the outside. I think it helped

01:41:18.000 --> 01:41:21.520
Okay, we're there progress. I don't want to go back down. Please don't make me go back down there

01:41:22.160 --> 01:41:24.160
Is this not the way should we do we?

01:41:24.640 --> 01:41:26.640
Oh, no, it's up. I see it

01:41:27.200 --> 01:41:29.200
Oh, we have a little swing

01:41:33.360 --> 01:41:37.840
Swing again on it. Oh, okay. Okay. We have swing mechanics stuff

01:41:38.800 --> 01:41:40.800
Uh

01:41:40.880 --> 01:41:43.520
Barrel classic rollover. Okay

01:41:44.480 --> 01:41:46.480
But not roll off the map. Oh, no

01:41:47.040 --> 01:41:49.360
That's why there's that metal pole there

01:41:50.080 --> 01:41:52.080
Why is it so cold?

01:41:52.320 --> 01:41:55.200
I knew it's drawn in with the fire. Eh, I'm playing as a cat. Okay

01:41:57.360 --> 01:42:02.240
Is there more of those bogey things ahead? Okay, I'm holding the right trigger. So we were running

01:42:03.680 --> 01:42:05.680
Where

01:42:08.800 --> 01:42:14.080
Ah, oh no, there's like there's a mechanic up ahead. What is it?

01:42:16.880 --> 01:42:18.400
What is it?

01:42:18.400 --> 01:42:21.440
What's the mechanic? I see red. I see a code

01:42:22.400 --> 01:42:26.080
I see it looks like I can just jump up to the left and I'll honestly

01:42:30.240 --> 01:42:32.240
Hack the door

01:42:38.800 --> 01:42:40.800
I'm waiting till they all come over

01:42:42.880 --> 01:42:44.880
Hack the door

01:42:51.280 --> 01:42:56.560
Wait, I can't lock them in though. Wait, do I need to lock them in?

01:42:59.680 --> 01:43:01.680
I'm not very bright. Wait

01:43:03.440 --> 01:43:06.080
I'm not very bright. Is that them all?

01:43:08.800 --> 01:43:10.800
Oh

01:43:12.480 --> 01:43:14.800
What and then go okay, okay, okay

01:43:16.080 --> 01:43:18.080
Okay, I get it. I get it

01:43:18.400 --> 01:43:21.840
Okay, and they can't jump over. Okay. I get it. I get it. I understand that was

01:43:22.800 --> 01:43:25.840
You want to go any faster buddy? Jeez. Not like there's like

01:43:26.480 --> 01:43:29.520
Organisms are ready. They mull your eyeballs out the socket

01:43:31.120 --> 01:43:32.480
Yeah

01:43:32.480 --> 01:43:36.080
I'll go on achievement for jumping 500 times and it's called catapult

01:43:36.320 --> 01:43:40.720
Okay, we did it. Oh, no, there's more. Whoa

01:43:43.200 --> 01:43:45.200
Good thing this game has aim assist

01:43:48.000 --> 01:43:50.000
Uh

01:43:51.120 --> 01:43:54.240
Are they gonna like pop out here? Oh, no

01:43:56.240 --> 01:44:03.520
Oh, please get me up. Oh, no. Oh, yes, and then move the plank darlin my my yin-yur

Oh, not good not good not good not good not good

01:44:16.720 --> 01:44:18.720
Oh

01:44:18.800 --> 01:44:20.800
Okay, where do we need to go?

01:44:21.680 --> 01:44:27.200
I see a light to the right. So maybe jump on that scaffolding and then they're stuck through here

01:44:27.840 --> 01:44:35.120
Okay, I'm gonna my money's on the scaffolding to the right

01:44:36.720 --> 01:44:40.560
Okay, let's go. Send it. Send it buddy. Send it. Send it. Send it. Send it

01:44:44.320 --> 01:44:46.320
What is there more

01:44:52.000 --> 01:44:54.880
Oh, I don't like it. I don't like it. I don't like it. I don't like it. I don't like it. I don't like it

01:44:55.120 --> 01:44:58.720
Oh, I don't like being chased. Please no more

01:44:59.840 --> 01:45:01.840
Okay, what's going on here?

01:45:02.480 --> 01:45:05.840
Did I just see some behind me? Okay. Why did I want to hack the door?

01:45:07.360 --> 01:45:10.480
Am I being chased? No, right. They're stuck inside

01:45:12.160 --> 01:45:14.800
There's a barrel. Okay barrels

01:45:15.600 --> 01:45:18.720
Hold on. Right. Okay. We can discover this memory first

01:45:19.440 --> 01:45:23.440
Okay, Neco Neco

01:45:25.360 --> 01:45:30.880
Neco corporate they were reason for waste management as trash from the upper levels overloaded

01:45:30.880 --> 01:45:38.240
They tried to develop a bacteria to dissolve at all after the humans disappeared that bacteria mutated growing eaten away more than trash

01:45:38.320 --> 01:45:40.320
And now we have drugs. Let's go

01:45:41.440 --> 01:45:47.680
Of course, it's a corporation that caused the d- mmm. I'm not surprised. This is my kind of game. That's right preach preach

01:45:48.640 --> 01:45:50.640
Right, so

01:45:53.360 --> 01:45:55.360
Hold on I'm just trying to

01:45:56.080 --> 01:46:01.040
So what open that gate they'll chase me and then grab the barrel very quickly

01:46:03.680 --> 01:46:05.360
And roll it over

01:46:05.360 --> 01:46:07.120
Okay, hold on hold on

Please a bit faster

01:46:20.560 --> 01:46:22.560
Oh, wait, can I hack myself in here?

01:46:23.120 --> 01:46:25.120
No, no, no, wait. I messed up

01:46:25.600 --> 01:46:26.800
Bring

01:46:26.800 --> 01:46:28.800
Dang. Oh, no, it's fine

01:46:29.200 --> 01:46:31.200
They can't come for me because they're stuck at that wall

01:46:34.480 --> 01:46:39.920
Oh, sorry, I heard something. Oh my god. Sorry. They made a really weird noise there and that freaked me out

01:46:41.520 --> 01:46:42.640
Oh

01:46:42.640 --> 01:46:45.120
What do you mean? I should play horror games. What are you talking about?

01:46:46.160 --> 01:46:48.160
No, they fucking terrify me

01:46:48.640 --> 01:46:52.480
Terrify like literally horror games or like donut on stuff because it just

01:46:53.200 --> 01:46:55.200
Horrifies me so much

01:46:56.880 --> 01:47:00.160
Okay, oh, yeah, you like that I face it maneuvers

01:47:03.040 --> 01:47:09.680
Up up up. Oh, that wasn't much of an up, but I'll take it. Oh, okay. That wasn't up. We're fine. We're safe. Whoa. You climb up that jeez

01:47:10.720 --> 01:47:12.720
Verically, are we safe over there?

01:47:14.160 --> 01:47:16.160
I see a lever

01:47:17.200 --> 01:47:19.200
I see a lift

01:47:19.600 --> 01:47:24.320
I think I see bodies. I see little glowing things

01:47:29.360 --> 01:47:31.360
Well

01:47:34.560 --> 01:47:36.800
I was fine just a layer at the mold where I'm going

01:47:37.760 --> 01:47:39.760
I was kind of kidding

01:47:43.280 --> 01:47:49.600
I was kind of kidding. I think I need to stall out the lift coming down

01:47:50.800 --> 01:47:52.800
Come on

01:47:52.960 --> 01:47:55.520
There's more dropping. Wait, that's cheating

01:47:56.480 --> 01:48:02.320
They're gonna stop me from running around. Oh wait, there is I see the lift. I see the lift

01:48:02.720 --> 01:48:05.760
It's coming down the shaft. I am

01:48:06.400 --> 01:48:09.360
Why is there so many jump jump?

01:48:10.800 --> 01:48:17.600
Please please get saved. Oh my god. Go. Oh my god. We just beat their vertical leap

01:48:18.640 --> 01:48:25.920
Oh, that's awful. That is awful. Please tell me we can unlock a gun. I'm not even kidding. Please tell me we get a gun

01:48:28.400 --> 01:48:30.400
Oh

01:48:30.400 --> 01:48:33.920
We need the mealmen we need the movement the mealmen

01:48:34.800 --> 01:48:35.920
I

01:48:35.920 --> 01:48:42.640
I really hope this cat gets a gun. I'm so sorry. There's no gun. No, I have to run away the entire time

01:48:43.680 --> 01:48:45.680
That's terrifying

01:48:46.320 --> 01:48:48.320
I'm so stressed

01:48:48.400 --> 01:48:50.400
Are we safe?

01:48:52.720 --> 01:48:54.720
Right

01:48:55.040 --> 01:48:57.040
Right open

01:48:57.280 --> 01:49:00.480
I demand you open how'd I get up? I go like this

01:49:01.440 --> 01:49:03.440
First of all

01:49:03.760 --> 01:49:07.840
Okay, there's no orange around. I think I'm safe

01:49:09.120 --> 01:49:12.560
Here is put the transceiver on the antenna this

01:49:14.800 --> 01:49:17.200
Uh transceiver here you go

01:49:17.360 --> 01:49:19.360
Oh

01:49:28.800 --> 01:49:30.800
We did it

01:49:31.520 --> 01:49:38.080
We're lighting it up. What does it mean? I don't really know. Well, we're communicating with the higher city, I guess

01:49:42.160 --> 01:49:44.560
Hydration check little reefling

01:49:45.280 --> 01:49:49.600
I love the aesthetics of this game. Yeah

01:49:56.000 --> 01:49:58.000
Activate in the elevator. Oh, maybe

01:50:02.560 --> 01:50:09.360
Look the view is beautiful from here. I remember now the city it was meant to be a shelter. Oh

01:50:10.080 --> 01:50:12.080
No

01:50:12.400 --> 01:50:16.560
Looks like those look like stars, but they're only light markings

01:50:18.000 --> 01:50:20.960
Lights marking the hermetic

01:50:21.600 --> 01:50:23.600
Roof sealing off the city

01:50:24.240 --> 01:50:28.160
Mankind built the shelter to protect themselves from the outside

01:50:28.240 --> 01:50:30.880
But I came at a cost nobody can get out

01:50:31.520 --> 01:50:36.800
The outside was a disaster completely barren unlivable and dangerous

01:50:39.600 --> 01:50:43.040
But if you come from there, it must mean it's safe again

01:50:43.680 --> 01:50:48.080
And my promise wasn't just to go to the outside. It was to open the city

01:50:50.400 --> 01:50:52.400
Yeah, is that your goal

01:50:52.560 --> 01:50:58.400
I still don't understand why some memories are coming back and others aren't but I'm certain now. This is my purpose

01:50:58.960 --> 01:51:05.440
I have to open the city. Come on. Let's get back and find Momo now that we've connected the transmitter

01:51:05.520 --> 01:51:07.520
We should be able to get help

01:51:08.160 --> 01:51:10.160
Okay, okay

01:51:10.560 --> 01:51:12.560
Not bad

01:51:14.480 --> 01:51:19.600
This is the longest ride we're putting a lot of faith in this little cat in a bucket honestly

01:51:21.600 --> 01:51:23.600
Cola burp emote win

01:51:24.080 --> 01:51:27.040
Soon everyone's emotes got submitted before me

01:51:27.600 --> 01:51:33.600
Mercy has been accepted as errors. I'm waiting to be accepted and then mine are being done last because um

01:51:34.480 --> 01:51:35.600
I

01:51:35.600 --> 01:51:41.600
Want the girls stuff to be done first and reeflings you guys are actually like super understanding the slums part two

01:51:41.760 --> 01:51:43.760
No, get me out of the slums. Come on. I've been here a little too long

01:51:46.240 --> 01:51:49.760
Oh my god, I bought these for Gimli and Vigo and

01:51:50.800 --> 01:51:57.360
Vigo doesn't play with toys and Gimli only plays with a specific toy that they discontinued and I'm absolutely reading

01:51:58.880 --> 01:52:00.880
Oh, no, he went

01:52:01.120 --> 01:52:04.000
Little outsider if you're all that's such a cute nickname

01:52:04.480 --> 01:52:07.920
Little outsider if you're reading this that means you're still alive. Excellent

01:52:08.000 --> 01:52:11.680
I took some equipment to the bar to take advantage of their antenna. Come meet me there

01:52:12.160 --> 01:52:15.520
I've locked the window, but the code to open it is simple. It is

01:52:19.600 --> 01:52:25.280
Be careful it's case sensitive. See at the bar that must be the code for the window near the entrance looks cool

01:52:25.360 --> 01:52:27.360
Okay, the bar we know where the bar is

01:52:27.760 --> 01:52:29.760
Oh this

01:52:31.680 --> 01:52:33.680
Oh

01:52:37.920 --> 01:52:39.920
Okay, that was I thought amen

01:52:41.120 --> 01:52:45.440
The code at the bar. Sorry. I get it now. Okay. Uh, let me

01:52:46.240 --> 01:52:49.200
refresh my memory of the city really quickly

01:52:51.040 --> 01:52:55.920
Uh, I can't remember where the bar is, but you know what we'll just make our way down

01:52:56.560 --> 01:52:58.560
And hope we're going the right way

01:52:59.120 --> 01:53:06.320
Uh, is that the bar? Oh, maybe no, no down little little outsider or or yinya as I call you please go down

01:53:06.480 --> 01:53:09.040
Yeah, just like that. Yay. This is it

01:53:10.000 --> 01:53:11.760
Hi momo

01:53:11.760 --> 01:53:13.760
Hey little furball

01:53:13.840 --> 01:53:19.520
Come here. I managed to get a signal. All right. Let's go buddy. Show me what you're working with. Oh, sorry

01:53:19.840 --> 01:53:21.840
We've got a little too excited

01:53:22.080 --> 01:53:25.920
But you show it. Oh, I'll pull up a chair. Well, I'll hold on let me get up

01:53:26.640 --> 01:53:31.280
Hold on. Let me get up. Oh, he actually putt me off. Oh, I'm getting head cut

01:53:33.600 --> 01:53:35.780
Let me see if I can get this thing working

01:53:40.960 --> 01:53:47.120
Hi, mommy. This cat ears look cute. Yeah, I'm a necklace today. Oh, I've almost got it

01:53:50.080 --> 01:53:52.080
Hello, can anyone hear me?

01:53:52.480 --> 01:53:59.200
Hello, yes, we can hear you. We're from the slums. We're looking for a way out and wait, is that you zanzibar?

01:54:00.480 --> 01:54:02.480
Momo

01:54:03.520 --> 01:54:09.040
I can't believe it. I'm so happy to hear your voice zanzibar. Where are you? Are the others okay? Yes

01:54:09.840 --> 01:54:12.640
We are safe. We found a way up

01:54:12.640 --> 01:54:14.640
Up

01:54:16.160 --> 01:54:22.400
Hello, do you still hear me? You have to go through the sewers to reach us. It's very dangerous

01:54:23.440 --> 01:54:25.440
It's not because everywhere

01:54:26.880 --> 01:54:28.880
Sewers, how? Hello

01:54:29.600 --> 01:54:31.920
Darn it. We've lost the signal

01:54:32.720 --> 01:54:37.200
I can't believe it. Zanzibar is alive. He and the other outsiders managed to go up through the sewers

01:54:37.520 --> 01:54:43.040
The sewers are the most dangerous place in the slums, but if zanzibar made it there must be a way

01:54:53.600 --> 01:54:59.200
You'll never get past the sewers. It's infested with zirks. They'll make a quick meal out of you

01:54:59.360 --> 01:55:01.360
Especially you little one

01:55:02.080 --> 01:55:05.520
Many tried their luck in the past and it does the end well

01:55:06.080 --> 01:55:10.720
Anyway, I warned you. Your business is none of my business

01:55:14.160 --> 01:55:16.160
Oh, he he gave him a warning

01:55:19.760 --> 01:55:20.400
Mmm

01:55:20.400 --> 01:55:27.760
Sumis his father doc used to be a great scientist who was working on some new weapon to fight the zirks

01:55:28.240 --> 01:55:31.840
A few years ago. He went off to test the device. I love a cave back

01:55:32.400 --> 01:55:34.400
Seamuses never in the south

01:55:35.200 --> 01:55:37.200
up here

01:55:37.760 --> 01:55:39.760
Not so good

01:55:41.440 --> 01:55:46.000
Don't listen to seamus. He's just scared like I was a doc bill weapon

01:55:46.160 --> 01:55:48.160
That's our ticket to join the outsiders

01:55:48.880 --> 01:55:55.920
In his notebook doc mentioned a secret lab a few times that must be where he was working on it

01:55:56.320 --> 01:56:01.280
There might be a clue in Seamuses apartment. Come on. Follow me

01:56:02.800 --> 01:56:04.800
I'll follow you

01:56:04.880 --> 01:56:06.880
I will follow you

01:56:07.200 --> 01:56:09.200
Follow you wherever you

01:56:09.520 --> 01:56:11.520
mainly

01:56:11.600 --> 01:56:14.320
Because I'm just a kitty cat

01:56:15.520 --> 01:56:20.080
Down in the slums without my little family

01:56:21.440 --> 01:56:26.400
Of shot no are in is it two tail two dots

01:56:27.280 --> 01:56:31.760
Two dots on tail. I've forgotten in the other cat. Oh, he's still cleaning it off

01:56:32.800 --> 01:56:38.960
Bro, I think you're gonna have to get a mural down or something because uh, yeah, but you ain't cleaning up paint on concrete

01:56:40.400 --> 01:56:45.360
Oh, is this a uh, no point in translating. I thought it was a memory. Oh knock knock

01:56:47.280 --> 01:56:49.280
Let us in

01:56:49.680 --> 01:56:56.560
Two dots poke a dot. Oh, that sounds right. Come on. Seamus open the door. You know, your father would have wanted to help us

01:56:57.440 --> 01:57:02.160
Two dots poke a dot shot noir and Cali Cali Cali Caloo

01:57:02.960 --> 01:57:08.400
Well, that was to be expected the situation is pretty tough on Seamus. He doesn't want to hear about the outsiders

01:57:08.400 --> 01:57:11.200
He won't help me, but you I think I have an idea

01:57:12.800 --> 01:57:16.320
Okay, what's your idea Momo?

01:57:19.680 --> 01:57:25.760
Oh, I'm to go in are you sure here take doc's notebook and show it to Seamus

01:57:26.720 --> 01:57:30.480
It contains a lot of information that will hopefully act as an electoral shock

01:57:31.040 --> 01:57:34.400
Find the secret lab little outsider. Oh, that's such a cute name

01:57:34.800 --> 01:57:39.840
I'm going back to the bar to try and re-establish communication with others. Okay. Thank you Momo

01:57:41.360 --> 01:57:43.360
Hi Seamus

01:57:44.640 --> 01:57:46.640

No, no, don't shoot me away take this. What is it? Wait, this is my papa

01:57:52.240 --> 01:57:56.240
Oh, wow, I never knew there's a secret room here in our flat, but where?

01:57:57.920 --> 01:58:04.080
Uh, okay. Well considering there's loads of things to knock down on the wall. I'm a gobo knock all the things off the wall

01:58:08.800 --> 01:58:17.280
They really didn't hide it did they? Okay, but what's the code? I don't see any numbers and stuff. These schematics

01:58:17.280 --> 01:58:19.280
I

01:58:20.960 --> 01:58:22.960
Like how to jump back every time

01:58:23.760 --> 01:58:25.760

You will considering the humans are all parish. Yeah, time will tell actually

01:58:35.280 --> 01:58:40.640
Actually factually as you are correct. Is it better than little seaweed? No, you don't call me little outsider

01:58:41.040 --> 01:58:45.280

01:59:17.440 --> 01:59:20.960
I've never seen this room. I can't believe he managed to hide it from me all this time

01:59:21.840 --> 01:59:26.240
These blueprints. They must be for dessert weapon. Wait, you said I didn't get a gun

01:59:27.360 --> 01:59:32.320
Papa was always so secretive with his work. He told me the weapon was working in theory

01:59:32.400 --> 01:59:36.640
But I needed a real life test. He went outside the slums and he never came back

01:59:38.560 --> 01:59:40.560
That must be very sweet

01:59:40.800 --> 01:59:42.800
The bugs

01:59:43.840 --> 01:59:45.600
Translate

01:59:45.600 --> 01:59:51.360
Observations cute sound, but never friendly old bacteria of human time eat all kinds of materials total

01:59:52.000 --> 01:59:58.000
Vision in the darkness reacts to intense light and that's a different color

02:00:00.160 --> 02:00:01.680
Um

02:00:01.680 --> 02:00:05.360
It's just a shelf. So wait, what am I to do? I'm just a cat the fuck

02:00:06.000 --> 02:00:08.640
What you want me to do here knock some stuff over

02:00:35.360 --> 02:00:38.560
Wait, oh, sorry. That was a bit too much of a jump. Was it in the box?

02:00:40.240 --> 02:00:42.560

Wait, I remember that that's his tracker

02:01:24.240 --> 02:01:27.840
Papa always used that tracker to keep an eye on where I was

02:01:27.920 --> 02:01:32.080
Maybe we can reverse it to find where he went. I can't believe my papa might still be alive

02:01:32.160 --> 02:01:37.520
I've missed him so much. You need a weapon for the zirks, right? My papa definitely took one with him

02:01:37.840 --> 02:01:42.320
We just need to repair the tracker so we can find him someone in the slum should be able to help come with me

02:01:42.400 --> 02:01:44.400
I'll open the door for you. Okay

02:01:44.560 --> 02:01:46.800

02:05:46.680 --> 02:05:50.600
very slowly now

02:05:53.400 --> 02:05:59.480
what do we think history so far have you guys the clocks are based 16 and not

02:06:00.320 --> 02:06:11.840
what does that mean this is a cute game I have to admit I got a bit turned around

02:06:11.840 --> 02:06:15.720
trying to get to that guy but now that we did it and we pretty much did all the

02:06:15.720 --> 02:06:23.720
other stuff it's a perfect game I just want my gun so I don't have to run away

02:06:23.720 --> 02:06:36.200
like a maniac every time I see this a zur 16 hours in a day it's interesting to

02:06:36.200 --> 02:06:40.480
see how differently you're playing from a zur what's a zur that must be it he

02:06:40.480 --> 02:06:44.800
really left the slum yeah it's dangerous out there but I must be sure I need to

02:06:44.800 --> 02:06:53.000
know let's do this as the coconut one said in Elden Ring let's get to it

02:06:53.720 --> 02:06:59.280
the earth rotational periods go down ours just as they work better with hexadecimal

02:06:59.280 --> 02:07:08.800
or maybe the capital is pigs one and the work day got changed to 16 oh no

02:07:10.160 --> 02:07:16.760
oh it's pulsating the only thing throw but I want in the vicinity near me is a

02:07:16.760 --> 02:07:29.560
tentacle can I be attacked here no he's shown me where go wait if he's shown me

02:07:29.560 --> 02:07:34.440
where it goes or a secret or something yeah this isn't really like much of a

02:07:34.440 --> 02:07:40.080
secret place I'm a just following and not muck about as Zora chose war picked a

02:07:40.080 --> 02:07:45.200
gun and killed everyone look all these eggs they will eat us I can't do this

02:07:45.200 --> 02:07:49.400
I'm not as fast as you the Zorks will get me for sure here take this badge my

02:07:49.400 --> 02:07:53.520

02:08:27.160 --> 02:08:31.760
little bit I don't see the orange yeah okay it's fine it's fine relax don't have

02:08:31.760 --> 02:08:40.000
it it's not a horror game strongy relax we loved it undulating flesh walls I

02:08:40.000 --> 02:08:46.680
never noticed a really cool detail look at how huge this wall is oh yes I remember

02:08:46.680 --> 02:08:50.400
it was a symbol of the division between those in the slums and in midtown that

02:08:50.400 --> 02:08:53.640
and the fact that they kept throwing their garbage down here what horrible thing

02:08:53.640 --> 02:09:01.720
to do maybe that's why they failed good I love this game already yes take down

02:09:01.720 --> 02:09:07.080
the high table I understand strongy good refling good refling you pleased me

02:09:07.080 --> 02:09:18.440
you will be rewarded for such loyalty this dad just run right down the middle

02:09:18.440 --> 02:09:22.720
I'm trying to look ahead it doesn't look like I go up it looks like I go down and

02:09:22.720 --> 02:09:33.120
run okay okay let's go let's just run send it little putters I'm holding a I

02:09:33.120 --> 02:09:44.440

And I run run run run run run run run run run this is a dead end

02:10:13.600 --> 02:10:16.100
Underneath underneath underneath underneath underneath underneath

Whoa why am I stuck why mistock okay, it's fine. I'm not stuck

02:10:27.860 --> 02:10:29.860
This way and swing it back

02:10:29.940 --> 02:10:31.940
Swing it back now y'all

02:10:32.100 --> 02:10:34.100
Chris grows

02:10:34.540 --> 02:10:36.740
And then go back and then swing it one more time

02:10:37.860 --> 02:10:39.860
Give me the old wrap around

02:10:41.900 --> 02:10:45.780
Could see it I could see where the under passage was cuz they lit it up

02:10:45.780 --> 02:10:51.740
I have to admit the game design with lighting up where you're supposed to go next. I appreciate greatly

02:10:55.540 --> 02:10:57.540
Is that trolley

02:10:58.540 --> 02:11:00.540
That's quite a lot to dodge

02:11:03.340 --> 02:11:05.340
Hey

02:11:05.340 --> 02:11:10.160
Do the Hawaiian search like oh my god, hold on little buddy. Oh

02:11:12.340 --> 02:11:16.460
Oh ouch, are you okay in your

02:11:20.820 --> 02:11:27.300
That was a huge fall it was dog should be nearby we must be cool. Are you okay? I'm limping

02:11:28.540 --> 02:11:32.020
Can dog patches up? Are we gonna be okay? Oh

02:11:34.140 --> 02:11:40.080
No, how'd uh oh you okay? Oh, we're walking off. Okay. We're walking off

02:11:41.280 --> 02:11:46.980
Okay, give it like yeah, you're you're you're spit has healing properties. Okay. I guess we have to go up I

02:11:48.020 --> 02:11:53.960
Can hear something is it just frogs like ambience or is like is it something that's gonna there's nothing orange though

02:11:54.960 --> 02:12:00.800
The video game wouldn't be so cruel as to not show orange if there's enemies nearby surely the game wouldn't do that

02:12:01.520 --> 02:12:03.520
No, those are frogs

02:12:04.280 --> 02:12:06.280
I'm actually a really good fool

02:12:08.280 --> 02:12:11.680
Same leg it's never fully healed per thing. Oh

02:12:13.520 --> 02:12:15.520
No

02:12:17.080 --> 02:12:19.080
Where they need to go

02:12:20.040 --> 02:12:22.040
Hold on

02:12:22.520 --> 02:12:27.040
Hold on I'm about to cross a barrier where they need to go. I can't see

02:12:27.840 --> 02:12:32.120
Just jump across the bridge and then to the right cuz it's all lit up there

02:12:39.920 --> 02:12:43.040
Oh you turn hold on this is lit up. Oh

02:12:48.520 --> 02:12:50.520
Use item

02:12:51.120 --> 02:12:58.640
An energy drink. Well, it's definitely no way hmm. It's an electrical generator, but it seems to require some other part function. Okay

02:13:02.200 --> 02:13:08.240
Okay, we're not gonna get jumped on this side, I don't think because of that generator we need to come back to it

02:13:09.760 --> 02:13:13.280
Did we follow the cable? I think so

02:13:16.040 --> 02:13:18.600
Okay, when the music gets intense I'll start screaming

02:13:21.280 --> 02:13:23.280
I

02:13:26.080 --> 02:13:28.080
Really don't want to make noise. Oh

02:13:35.120 --> 02:13:40.600
Thank goodness it's in a cage, why is it in a cage because that baits clearly

02:13:42.040 --> 02:13:44.040
What generate? Uh

02:13:44.560 --> 02:13:46.560
Hello

02:13:47.000 --> 02:13:49.000
Is this on its head? Oh, hello

02:13:51.040 --> 02:13:53.040
Oh

02:13:53.400 --> 02:13:58.960
Sorry, didn't mean to scare of course the scientist has like crazy cables coming over this here

02:14:00.280 --> 02:14:02.280
Wow

02:14:02.320 --> 02:14:07.520
Wait, you're not a zerk. Who are you? That's my badge you're wearing. How'd you find it?

02:14:07.560 --> 02:14:13.920
Did my son send you? Oh, see miss you clever boy. You've been alone here for oh, I've been alone here for ages

02:14:13.920 --> 02:14:19.200
I came here to test my defluxor, but it didn't go as planned. I wish I could go back home

02:14:19.200 --> 02:14:20.840
I miss my son daily

02:14:20.840 --> 02:14:25.640
You can have a look around the house if you want, but I have no idea how to escape this place

02:14:27.760 --> 02:14:33.520
What do you what do you mean? Wait, you're not gonna say knows what to do remember

02:14:35.800 --> 02:14:42.080
What do you remember little buddy? I've seen humans wear costumes like I mean similar

02:14:42.080 --> 02:14:46.680
They were small and running around making lots of noise. Oh, they were children. Yes

02:14:47.000 --> 02:14:53.240
The streets felt much more alive with children even with the difficulty they brought the adults seem to love them very much

02:14:53.320 --> 02:14:58.440
Doc says he misses Seamus. Is this the same thing? Yeah, it is. Oh

02:14:59.360 --> 02:15:02.560
No, no, he's out of beverages. Oh dear

02:15:03.760 --> 02:15:05.760
What's going on here?

02:15:06.880 --> 02:15:08.880
Hello radio. Oh

02:15:12.240 --> 02:15:14.240
Why oh

02:15:17.680 --> 02:15:19.680
I

02:15:22.320 --> 02:15:24.320
Was this mean

02:15:24.960 --> 02:15:29.440
But Morty you go to shove the mega seats. Oh, it does kind of oh, no

02:15:30.200 --> 02:15:32.200
It does look a wee bit like Rick

02:15:33.840 --> 02:15:38.120
Hey, be careful with the defluxor at fill charge it can explode zirks like

02:15:40.400 --> 02:15:44.840
What do you mean be careful give give me it meow

02:15:45.840 --> 02:15:51.320
This baby needs 1.21 gigawatts to work and the only thing around here that

02:15:51.480 --> 02:15:57.080
Kind of just as a generator outside the house. The problem with that is it's not gonna start

02:15:57.080 --> 02:16:02.520
I think a fuse blew and with all the zirks around it's too dangerous for me go and fix it

02:16:03.360 --> 02:16:07.560
I'm not fast enough, but you might be if you reach the generator and replace the fuse

02:16:07.560 --> 02:16:12.560
It should be able to get the defluxor recharge. Come on. Follow me. I'll show you what to do

02:16:13.320 --> 02:16:17.080
Okay, I'm listening. Are you about to give me a weapon?

02:16:17.880 --> 02:16:23.360
Do I need to not be absolutely terrified and shitting my panty loners? Hmm?

02:16:24.480 --> 02:16:28.160
Cuz they just we ship my pants when it comes to these bad boys

02:16:30.000 --> 02:16:36.720
Well, I was actually already at the generator, so I know where to go here take this fuse is brand new

02:16:36.840 --> 02:16:43.360
Okay, thank you turning on the generator will be allowed to expect company once you fix the generator

02:16:43.360 --> 02:16:45.360
It should be able to charge

02:16:45.440 --> 02:16:52.320
The kick and kick start the defluxor you just need to follow this cable change the fuse and meet me back here

02:16:52.320 --> 02:16:58.400
Best of luck. Okay, so there's gonna be a bit of a jump sequence once we start it, but that's fine. We know where to go

02:17:00.080 --> 02:17:02.560
Surely they wouldn't spawn them in right now surely

02:17:02.560 --> 02:17:09.320
Surely they wouldn't spawn them in right now. No, it's after I do the generator. Okay

02:17:10.400 --> 02:17:14.040
The game is giving me a grace period. It's either I take a right or a left here

02:17:19.560 --> 02:17:22.560
Okay, now what were they coming from I can do it

02:17:25.400 --> 02:17:28.400
I can do it ominous red glow

02:17:33.160 --> 02:17:35.160
Hey

02:17:36.760 --> 02:17:38.760
Yes, give me that technology

02:17:41.720 --> 02:17:44.680
Wait what I can't cross

02:17:45.920 --> 02:17:52.080
Oh my god, bro, you're gonna need to aim bought this stuff. I can't get across cuz they're coming on the bridge

02:17:54.480 --> 02:17:59.560
They need to wait until it involves the mall doc you need better aim I

02:18:00.480 --> 02:18:03.000
Can't even get along the bridge

02:18:13.480 --> 02:18:17.640
Think I'm okay, okay, you actually didn't do a bad job

02:18:22.120 --> 02:18:24.120
Why would you do that game

02:18:24.880 --> 02:18:30.440
You know that would scare me

02:18:31.640 --> 02:18:36.640
This isn't a horror game. Why would you do that? Get me inside right now? Oh my god

02:18:39.600 --> 02:18:43.960
Doc is beaming. Yeah, oh you celebrate is so happy hydration chair

02:18:46.800 --> 02:18:50.760
Amazing you got the generator back on heck. Yeah, dude. You're well. Yeah

02:18:51.760 --> 02:18:54.600
And how do you see you're welcome in French I've already forgotten

02:18:56.280 --> 02:18:58.280
Doody and me duty and I

02:19:01.520 --> 02:19:04.720
Yeah, my voice is unfortunately breaking at the moment

02:19:05.880 --> 02:19:10.720
Have you seen how powerful the defluxer is it's definitely our way out here wait a minute

02:19:10.720 --> 02:19:14.520
I might be able to mount this defluxer to your drone

02:19:14.520 --> 02:19:16.640
Oh, that's exactly what I want to hear doc

02:19:16.760 --> 02:19:22.920
Give me um, you know that guy that smashes like money on the table gif and basically that right now

02:19:24.200 --> 02:19:26.200
You do not have to tell me twice. Oh

02:19:27.880 --> 02:19:29.880
Oh, he popped

02:19:39.040 --> 02:19:41.040
Thank you

02:19:41.400 --> 02:19:44.720
It works the defluxer is now installed on your fancy drone

02:19:44.920 --> 02:19:49.320
It's not meant to run off such a small amount of power if you use it too much a kid malfunction

02:19:49.320 --> 02:19:54.400
Just remember it's dangerous. Now. Let's go back to the village. I'm coming home to my son. Oh

02:19:55.200 --> 02:19:57.200
That's so adorable

02:19:59.800 --> 02:20:01.800
You had I do press a

02:20:03.400 --> 02:20:06.120
No, he's jumping on it. Wait, how do I use it?

02:20:06.120 --> 02:20:08.120
Oh

02:20:16.480 --> 02:20:18.480
Yeah, oh

02:20:18.720 --> 02:20:26.280
My god, okay, it's a wee bit short. That's fine. It's better than nothing. I'ma take it. I must take it. Okay

02:20:27.760 --> 02:20:29.760
Do you be bombs? Oh

02:20:32.880 --> 02:20:35.240
Take out all those darks and we can get through yes

02:20:36.520 --> 02:20:40.400
Wow, oh, sorry, I did it a bit quicker than the store. Well, it's working great

02:20:40.400 --> 02:20:43.800
But as expected it can overheat let it cool for a bit when that happens

02:20:43.800 --> 02:20:46.320
I hope we will last until we reach the village. Don't say that

02:20:47.520 --> 02:20:52.640
Why don't you bring your freaking big-ass one as well? Why does it have to be down to me?

02:20:53.280 --> 02:20:57.200
Like I'm a freaking cat. I'm literally in my head like oh

02:20:58.680 --> 02:21:01.640
They're gonna start jumping out of those honestly. Oh

02:21:02.680 --> 02:21:04.680

02:21:49.120 --> 02:21:51.120

The other barrel needs to go to the pay this play

02:21:59.080 --> 02:22:01.080
It's the steam coming over

02:22:01.680 --> 02:22:08.120
I see it. I couldn't see it before but I see it now. It wasn't the paper all it was the freaking vent

02:22:17.520 --> 02:22:19.680
I know for a fact we're about to get jumped

02:22:25.040 --> 02:22:29.720

They seem to like you more than the dog

02:24:03.600 --> 02:24:07.480
I think they go for organic matter like a preference if you will

02:24:08.120 --> 02:24:10.640
Cuz I guess they killed all the humans. I

02:24:12.080 --> 02:24:14.640

Is it down an alley way that we haven't been down maybe?

02:27:05.000 --> 02:27:07.000
Fizzy juice not in there

02:27:09.840 --> 02:27:11.840
That's the way up

02:27:14.560 --> 02:27:19.280
Oh, oh it's a shortcut. That's actually a pretty decent shortcut

02:27:21.160 --> 02:27:24.400
Petite veils. Yes. I need that

02:27:37.520 --> 02:27:44.480
Feel like I've scoured the area for a vending machine. It's inside Momo's apartment. Oh

02:27:45.600 --> 02:27:47.600
Yeah, that's a new unlock isn't it

02:27:51.160 --> 02:27:53.160
Or I've gone too far maybe

02:27:54.120 --> 02:27:56.120
That's that guy

02:27:58.160 --> 02:28:02.520
Yeah, I'm getting a bit turned around hold on must be done this way

02:28:07.520 --> 02:28:09.520
Okay

02:28:15.880 --> 02:28:17.880
Hmm

02:28:21.880 --> 02:28:23.880
Last song

02:28:28.320 --> 02:28:35.280
Here these are just slept through the gap in the door with the bars in it

02:28:37.520 --> 02:28:43.520
Slip through the gap the van. Oh, sorry, it's not even open

02:28:50.080 --> 02:28:56.360
Slip through the gap in the door with the bars in it that Samus's apartment oops

02:28:58.880 --> 02:29:00.880
Momo's apartment

02:29:01.560 --> 02:29:04.060
Is that the one that was up

02:29:05.320 --> 02:29:09.520
Must be because we were doing rooftop scale in in order to get any of those

02:29:11.240 --> 02:29:13.240
Wow slip through the bars

02:29:13.840 --> 02:29:15.840
Shut up to all my bars

02:29:16.560 --> 02:29:18.560

Was it this one, I mean there was only two apartments it can be it's either the window one or that one

02:29:52.120 --> 02:29:54.120
I think it may be this one

02:29:55.120 --> 02:30:01.600
It was a 50-50 because we know that dogs like Zanzibar one

02:30:03.600 --> 02:30:06.160

They need one more in a web says there's four cans I already bought a cat like I used the can on something

02:32:45.280 --> 02:32:49.600
I don't know where the last freaking vendor machine is. I can't see anything

02:32:50.920 --> 02:32:59.000
Highlighted like a vendor machine either. That's not been used. I've used one on the rooftop. So it must be like in something

One can for the cables yet if you've used one we're only missing one then yeah

02:33:07.800 --> 02:33:10.360
I'm gonna go back over to that roof

02:33:10.800 --> 02:33:17.340
Just because I didn't really explore that side of the map because I did the quest and then I was off on one

02:33:19.240 --> 02:33:21.240
I'm on the wrong way

02:33:21.920 --> 02:33:24.840
Did you get the energy drink 2k speed?

02:33:26.360 --> 02:33:29.040
Yeah, I've got they're all 2k speed

02:33:31.000 --> 02:33:36.080
Energy drink one outside Doc's apartment we have that okay good. I

02:33:37.080 --> 02:33:41.120
Got one on the rooftop confirmed. There was like one I picked up from a rooftop

02:33:46.200 --> 02:33:52.040
I got the main one that was right there, so it might whatever the one that's in an obscure places

02:33:52.040 --> 02:33:55.600
That's the one I need. Oh, there's a memory over there. I can see it

02:34:01.040 --> 02:34:03.760
Just to see if there's like any rooftop that

02:34:04.760 --> 02:34:08.440
Looks accessible that I've not jumped up one. I

02:34:10.560 --> 02:34:14.000
Think we have the rip human graffiti one

02:34:16.800 --> 02:34:19.320

Hello, are you okay now?

02:34:51.080 --> 02:34:56.800
My friend and I love talking tossing buckets at each other good clean fun or dancer neighbor disagree

02:34:56.800 --> 02:35:01.800
So we're taking a break right now. Oh, I didn't realize they're doing it for fun. I thought they were working

02:35:02.600 --> 02:35:08.520
The final energy drink location is on the rooftops of the slums to start head up the rooftops and find

02:35:09.040 --> 02:35:10.120
Heptor

02:35:10.120 --> 02:35:13.840
He's sitting on a little bucket next to a sofa

02:35:14.640 --> 02:35:17.120
Near the robots for a chucking pain

02:35:19.760 --> 02:35:21.760
Old man

02:35:27.920 --> 02:35:31.040
Maybe he's up here jump

02:35:32.080 --> 02:35:34.080
Wait

02:35:37.000 --> 02:35:39.000
Is it this one

02:35:39.840 --> 02:35:47.800
Are you hip-tor? No, you're swan. I could name those like real constellations a big circle of the ball

02:35:48.160 --> 02:35:52.280
No need more brain-throwing. Hey, yeah, what do you want nothing? I'm sorry

02:35:57.000 --> 02:36:00.640
The guy sat in the chair that you couldn't rub against okay

02:36:01.920 --> 02:36:03.760
I

02:36:03.760 --> 02:36:10.480
And then need to find that gentleman. Oh, please go up. Thank you darling

02:36:22.360 --> 02:36:25.680
Okay, I faint him okay now that I found him hold on

02:36:26.680 --> 02:36:33.440
From hip-tor hi hip-tor followed the little wooden ramp to the left

02:36:43.400 --> 02:36:46.560
Look down to spot a balcony below you

02:36:46.800 --> 02:36:48.800
The

02:36:52.960 --> 02:36:56.600
Right the final vending machine is on the balcony, so make your way down

02:36:59.120 --> 02:37:01.280
The ramp was immediately

02:37:04.120 --> 02:37:07.160
Oh my god, that's so obscure

02:37:08.440 --> 02:37:10.440
That is so obscure

02:37:11.200 --> 02:37:15.480
Development team you should be ashamed of yourself. How is anyone supposed to find that?

02:37:16.600 --> 02:37:19.400
At least make it possible if you're gonna do things like that

02:37:20.720 --> 02:37:22.720
Okay, now we can buy the last memory

02:37:28.680 --> 02:37:30.680
Shop we need the shop

02:37:33.880 --> 02:37:35.880
Why some music go

02:37:41.240 --> 02:37:43.240
Agreed that was painful to find I

02:37:43.720 --> 02:37:48.000
Could not have done that I would not have been able to do that if you guys didn't tell me in spec

02:37:48.920 --> 02:37:55.000
Well again, what do you want now? This is an ancient relic. I will cost three energy drinks one

02:37:57.160 --> 02:37:59.160
Here you go, what is it?

02:38:00.840 --> 02:38:02.840
Remember

02:38:03.360 --> 02:38:05.360
The box were to help

02:38:05.880 --> 02:38:12.960
This is an early model of a companion back then they didn't have any personality. They were just glorified autonomous cleaners

02:38:13.240 --> 02:38:20.880
I think it's nice that the eventually mimic human is quickly missed them and in that way they kind of kept them from going extinct

02:38:21.000 --> 02:38:23.000
They're good robots

02:38:23.240 --> 02:38:28.880
Okay, we did it and then we'll go our last song. I don't know what it's gonna be, but let's find out. I

02:38:29.760 --> 02:38:34.240
Don't know if we can make a song of it or if it's gonna be like hi

02:38:35.840 --> 02:38:38.240
Oh, thank you for the music. I will practice you see

02:38:38.920 --> 02:38:40.920

Well done. Have a badge as a token of my gratitude gained an item. Let's see. What's the last please?

02:39:05.520 --> 02:39:08.200
Petit and then VALSE any

02:39:09.160 --> 02:39:10.660
French refling

02:39:11.180 --> 02:39:16.900
No, we're not doing SPH. That's for another location

02:39:19.820 --> 02:39:22.820
Not one French refling lurking for Belgium is

02:39:23.700 --> 02:39:28.740
French for the little walls. Okay, let's go. Okay a dance. Okay a small dance

02:39:40.660 --> 02:39:48.820
As I slowly lean from left to right, I ask you please dance with me tonight

02:39:49.380 --> 02:39:58.100
We sway together under the moon and together we enjoy our month of gin

02:39:58.340 --> 02:40:05.900
It's already gone and July is here and I wouldn't have it any other way

02:40:10.820 --> 02:40:12.820
Thank you all done

02:40:14.500 --> 02:40:18.740
Thank you for all that. I'm a great musician now. Yeah, thank you

02:40:20.020 --> 02:40:22.020
Okay, we're ready to go

02:40:22.940 --> 02:40:28.140
Uncle uncle. Merci. Okay. I think I'll finish this area now because we did what we did

02:40:29.460 --> 02:40:33.420
All right, let me just remember the old controls for the old light

02:40:35.700 --> 02:40:40.620
Okay, I think we just loaded into another area and that's why it did that and I'm not about to be violently chasing

02:40:40.660 --> 02:40:42.660
by a hundred of those bills

02:40:43.620 --> 02:40:48.180
Hello, Momo. Are you going to see your friends?

02:40:49.860 --> 02:40:51.860
Oh, I understand

02:40:54.020 --> 02:40:59.460
I can't believe you found docking and no with this now we can go find zons of all

02:41:00.660 --> 02:41:02.660
Oh, no

02:41:03.220 --> 02:41:07.540
Will this dream be another seven every one? I'm not gonna 100% in this game now

02:41:07.780 --> 02:41:10.660
I'm I already walked past like a few a couple of memories

02:41:12.500 --> 02:41:13.860
Um

02:41:13.860 --> 02:41:17.940
Stormi I have a question who in the fresh heck curse she be to become a muppet

02:41:19.060 --> 02:41:21.140
What does that mean? I don't know what I mean

02:41:22.100 --> 02:41:27.140
Oh, we're in a new location. Okay. I don't know what chapter we're on. I don't know how many there are but

02:41:27.860 --> 02:41:29.860
progress question mark

02:41:30.820 --> 02:41:34.500
Yeah, starting if you use the purple beam you get a heat meter

02:41:35.540 --> 02:41:38.180
a reasonable length stream by stroney who

02:41:39.300 --> 02:41:44.740
Shebe's avatar is um, is she is she does is she's streaming not on her model lmao?

02:41:52.420 --> 02:41:59.140
When the moon hips you're high like a big piece of high

02:41:59.940 --> 02:42:01.940
So

02:42:19.540 --> 02:42:25.140
She looks like a child's guardian character in stray the sirre section is found in chapter six of the game

02:42:25.860 --> 02:42:27.860
Uh

02:42:28.180 --> 02:42:30.180
Okay

02:42:30.980 --> 02:42:35.380
Can you look on the other side sure of course, uh, right just look on the other side of the gate

02:42:35.460 --> 02:42:37.540
Well, I can only jump on one platform. So

02:42:38.660 --> 02:42:42.100
I'm gonna jump through the bars. Dang. I've got skills

02:42:43.540 --> 02:42:50.500
Uh, huh gets up from over here. Don't think I don't see your devious plans video game. I can read right through you

02:42:51.540 --> 02:42:53.540
go across up and across

02:42:53.700 --> 02:42:57.540
And basically three more chapters to go. Oh, we steam it. We steam rolling

02:42:58.420 --> 02:43:00.420
We jump straight

02:43:01.300 --> 02:43:02.500
Yeah

02:43:02.500 --> 02:43:04.500
right in front

02:43:04.500 --> 02:43:06.500
Uh anything up here

02:43:07.060 --> 02:43:09.060
I don't want to jump down in case it's not

02:43:09.140 --> 02:43:13.220
Came to jump down. I know I'm about to get jumped by those xx. Sorry video games

02:43:13.300 --> 02:43:16.500
But you make it too obvious. How do I open the gate? I'm a cat

02:43:17.380 --> 02:43:22.340
What buttons am I supposed to mash to open? Oh, I see the lever behind the xx

02:43:22.500 --> 02:43:24.180
Mm-hmm

02:43:24.180 --> 02:43:26.180
Just do it

02:43:26.500 --> 02:43:28.900
Exactly get out of here

02:43:30.260 --> 02:43:33.620
I knew it. I knew you dastardly planned

02:43:35.460 --> 02:43:37.460
I knew your plan. Oh, no

02:43:38.100 --> 02:43:43.620
Oh, no, it's can be. Oh wait am I safe up here? Oh my god. Oh my god. I'm so smart

02:43:46.820 --> 02:43:51.300
Take this. Yeah, that's right. We can do better. Mmm. You're gonna pop

02:43:52.740 --> 02:43:54.740
That's right

02:43:55.300 --> 02:44:01.220
I can see your video game. I know your plans. I know your development team. I've played far too many video games to be

02:44:02.340 --> 02:44:07.700
To be outsmarted with such dukes. How do you meow? That's right. Exactly. Mm-hmm

02:44:08.340 --> 02:44:10.340
Not one enemy in sight. I'm just

02:44:12.740 --> 02:44:16.420
How do you even insult me? Are you gonna pick me up, please?

02:44:17.460 --> 02:44:18.980
Please pick me up

02:44:18.980 --> 02:44:20.980
Meow, please pick me up

02:44:21.940 --> 02:44:24.180
Can I jump on you jump? Okay

02:44:27.300 --> 02:44:30.980
I don't understand if I don't directly talk to you and the thing doesn't translate for me

02:44:31.620 --> 02:44:33.620
Johnny you always make us

02:44:34.740 --> 02:44:36.740
That has to smell so bad

02:44:38.180 --> 02:44:41.380
What smells worse me when I'm pheromone maxing or like

02:44:43.060 --> 02:44:46.420
Exploding when coming into contact with uv raises that replay

02:44:47.140 --> 02:44:49.380
Bruh rump maxers any rump

02:44:51.300 --> 02:44:54.660
You got them good meow. That's right. I'm supposed to be meow

02:44:55.460 --> 02:44:57.460
Hey, what I can't even do

02:44:58.020 --> 02:45:00.020
Are you gonna jump on me?

02:45:00.180 --> 02:45:04.740
Don't think I don't see you. Are they gonna jump on the boat? You better not

02:45:06.340 --> 02:45:08.900
Is it actually warning us it's about to jump down?

02:45:11.380 --> 02:45:15.540
Or is it just welcoming us into its domain? Okay, I think it's just welcoming us

02:45:16.980 --> 02:45:18.980
Okay, let's see

02:45:19.940 --> 02:45:26.580
Good good new york meow. That's right. Okay today. We're playing story

02:45:27.300 --> 02:45:28.500
and

02:45:28.500 --> 02:45:30.420
I'm a cat

02:45:30.420 --> 02:45:32.420
I've got a uv array

02:45:34.820 --> 02:45:36.820
You stop jumping

02:45:37.140 --> 02:45:39.140
You stinky stinky

02:45:39.860 --> 02:45:41.860
Zerks be like this is our tour

02:45:42.660 --> 02:45:44.660
Hey, get out of here

02:45:45.220 --> 02:45:47.220
Hey, mr. Jay

02:45:47.220 --> 02:45:50.180
I'm Harley Quinn Zores. I can't meow

02:45:54.820 --> 02:45:56.820
Oh

02:45:59.860 --> 02:46:02.260
Uh, what's the situation momo?

02:46:04.020 --> 02:46:08.340
This is old machinery is broken now. I think we can only open it manually

02:46:09.300 --> 02:46:11.300
We

02:46:11.700 --> 02:46:18.260
Do you mean open it manually we're about to get jumped, you know that right?

02:46:25.540 --> 02:46:30.500
You're just walking them all up getting that boat. Is it me about to get jumped?

02:46:32.660 --> 02:46:38.900
I'm so even though we have protection. Oh wait. Oh no, I have to go on my own

02:46:41.300 --> 02:46:45.300
It's the end of the ride. Oh, I need to go more. I'm sorry. He's holding it open for me

02:46:46.740 --> 02:46:48.740
Uh, I can't go with you, but uh

02:46:49.700 --> 02:46:56.420
I won't stop looking for a way when you find zanzibar and clementine tell them I was brave. You're relax momo. You're not dying

02:46:57.300 --> 02:47:00.420
If anyone's dying, it's fucking me. Look at this place

02:47:01.700 --> 02:47:03.700
Oh my god, it's not letting me run

02:47:03.780 --> 02:47:05.780
Why would you not let me run?

02:47:06.100 --> 02:47:08.100
Don't do such things on me

02:47:19.540 --> 02:47:23.780
Maybe one month we won't we'll beat the peeler allegations, but this month is not that month

02:47:26.180 --> 02:47:28.180
Thank you for the tip really legend

02:47:29.460 --> 02:47:32.100
Why why are we peeing on main? What's going on?

02:47:32.340 --> 02:47:38.900
Um, wait, I can't go in that. That's murky water. Wait, so what was I supposed to do here? Is really a secret?

02:47:41.780 --> 02:47:43.780
Can I pop these?

02:47:47.700 --> 02:47:49.940
Um, was there even anything?

02:47:52.660 --> 02:47:59.860
Wait, no, this is the dead end. Is the water shallow and it just looks like it's not or am I going crazy?

02:48:02.900 --> 02:48:04.900
Yeah

02:48:11.700 --> 02:48:13.700
Uh

02:48:17.700 --> 02:48:19.940
Were they gonna pop as I walked past I think

02:48:21.540 --> 02:48:24.500
Remind me who started the allegations. I actually don't know

02:48:24.900 --> 02:48:32.820
No, we must move through the stagnant pee water on a plate. Look at the menacingly looking at me

02:48:32.820 --> 02:48:37.060
They don't know that I'm I've got a strap. I'm built carry. You know, I'm saying I'm carrying right now

02:48:37.220 --> 02:48:40.980
No, no, no, I saw it. I can see a bend. It's a secret. It must

02:48:48.340 --> 02:48:53.300
Yeah, you better be better be watching out for me. I'm a jumpy

02:48:54.980 --> 02:48:58.580
I'm a murder you and I'm gonna make a little like an accident

02:49:00.820 --> 02:49:02.820
Okay, these are active

02:49:06.180 --> 02:49:08.180
Hold on

02:49:11.700 --> 02:49:13.700
So like how their butts get open

02:49:14.020 --> 02:49:19.620
Wasn't that in me with her drinking stream where chat blackmailed her into recording that is that where it starts?

02:49:20.340 --> 02:49:22.340
Oh

02:49:23.940 --> 02:49:27.460
My my little sister isn't so innocent anymore. She can

02:49:30.980 --> 02:49:32.980
Okay

02:49:34.180 --> 02:49:36.980
I didn't mean to activate another one but fine. It's fine

02:49:38.980 --> 02:49:40.980
Try not to overheat it too much

02:49:44.340 --> 02:49:46.980
I can do it like that and just kind of see someone as they come

02:49:49.860 --> 02:49:51.860
I

02:49:52.260 --> 02:49:55.700
Think emmy is more likely to do it and she be no different not that one

02:49:55.940 --> 02:50:00.980
I know it was just sort of a throwaway line, but I can't get an idea of strongy pheromone max and out of my head

02:50:01.300 --> 02:50:05.940
Oh, it's because I'm fucking minion. Sorry, but I'm like an absolute like knee. I'm not being funny

02:50:07.140 --> 02:50:10.660
Like I didn't go outside if I don't need to go outside. I don't like

02:50:11.620 --> 02:50:16.580
I kind of discussed I don't even know if I should talk about it. You guys will be like so disgusted by it

02:50:17.460 --> 02:50:18.900
but like

02:50:18.900 --> 02:50:23.060
I don't even wear deodorant because I'm gonna go outside so it's like why it was the point of being deodorant

02:50:25.140 --> 02:50:27.140
Um

02:50:27.860 --> 02:50:30.020
But I hope my dad's not mad at me when he sees me

02:50:31.700 --> 02:50:34.740
He's gonna be like strongy. You're like shit and I'm like, yeah

02:50:37.460 --> 02:50:39.460
Oh, come on literally one

02:50:39.540 --> 02:50:41.540
I

02:50:45.700 --> 02:50:48.580
Hope one of the upcoming emotes is sniff. I mean if you want

02:50:49.220 --> 02:50:52.420
Uh, I've got more than 10 like emotes slots

02:50:52.980 --> 02:50:59.140
Unlock how many heart mojis are there like what's the highest number it goes up to because that's how many emotes slots are unlocked

02:51:00.980 --> 02:51:03.060
But I'm not nice. There's so many

02:51:03.700 --> 02:51:12.180
15 okay, so I'm getting a batch of 10 and then I get an extra five and then if I make more then

02:51:13.300 --> 02:51:15.300
You know

02:51:16.100 --> 02:51:18.100
Yeah, I know I'm definitely open to that

02:51:19.220 --> 02:51:21.220
God this place is like

02:51:21.780 --> 02:51:28.900
Well, there is this how you're supposed to tackle these areas just this feels like cleaning simulator now a little bit just kind of like

02:51:34.020 --> 02:51:36.740
Oh, oh that guy popped in with

02:51:39.220 --> 02:51:43.220
The hunger for the cat flash is okay the last couple of years from brothel everyone

02:51:47.300 --> 02:51:50.900
It's not even that I tried to be mingin or anything, but I just I'm mingin

02:51:51.860 --> 02:51:57.380
Like when I'm like when I say see is like, oh, I've not showered in a few days or whatever. I'm like, it's not a

02:51:57.780 --> 02:52:03.700
Teehee. I'm so gross and nasty. It's like no, I ain't showered rough a fucking reek

02:52:04.660 --> 02:52:06.660
I got be all out of the wazoo

02:52:06.820 --> 02:52:08.820
I've got greasy hair out of the wazoo

02:52:11.860 --> 02:52:13.860
That's a little it

02:52:15.140 --> 02:52:17.140
Yeah, if you don't sweat it's pretty okay

02:52:18.980 --> 02:52:22.740
Oh, no, I'm ready. Sorry, but I'm actually ready for you guys. I'm not being serious

02:52:22.980 --> 02:52:24.980
I

02:52:26.500 --> 02:52:31.860
I'm so ready. I'm not scared anymore. I can hardly see anything by the way. I don't know why there's like a duff freaking

02:52:32.500 --> 02:52:35.940
Filler and of course it goes away the moment I complain about it because why wouldn't it?

02:52:38.580 --> 02:52:40.580
Okay, let's just let's just go next

02:52:45.300 --> 02:52:47.300
Yeah, that's right. You can't scare me now

02:52:48.420 --> 02:52:50.900
You can maybe jump scare me around a corner, but that's about it

02:52:52.740 --> 02:52:54.740
I

02:52:54.980 --> 02:52:56.980
Whoa

02:52:57.060 --> 02:52:59.060
Where are the eyes?

02:52:59.140 --> 02:53:03.940
Hold on. Hold on. This seems like a bit much. I don't think the torch can handle all of this

02:53:13.460 --> 02:53:17.140
There's no way I'm supposed to be being seen in Dungeon Mad down here

02:53:17.620 --> 02:53:19.620
Oh

02:53:23.220 --> 02:53:28.260
Oh the game's lagging because it's loading a new area, right that's manageable

02:53:34.740 --> 02:53:36.740
Wow

02:53:37.060 --> 02:53:39.060
I

02:53:42.660 --> 02:53:47.460
Stony really gets stinky if I am I'm literally turning us all into Napoleon dynamite

02:53:48.580 --> 02:53:50.580
Can I go through here?

02:53:52.420 --> 02:53:54.980
I'm coming back in three days don't want

02:53:57.060 --> 02:54:02.420
God it really does not oh the eyes are asleep on the wall

02:54:03.140 --> 02:54:06.580
I can't do anything to the eyes. Hmm

02:54:08.980 --> 02:54:11.940
I have to wash my hair every other day, but we don't seem to wash it off

02:54:12.820 --> 02:54:15.460
Oh, I used to have really greasy hair

02:54:16.020 --> 02:54:20.740
And I would have to wash it every day like I'd wake up and it'd be fecking greasy and smooth

02:54:21.940 --> 02:54:27.460
But ever since I've been using lush shampoo bars, I actually get like a couple of days with it

02:54:28.100 --> 02:54:30.100
And which is really nice

02:54:30.420 --> 02:54:35.540
Um, so I can't recommend lush shampoo bars enough to be honest

02:54:35.700 --> 02:54:41.540
So if you're ever if you've got the money to treat yourself, it is a bit more expensive, but like

02:54:42.980 --> 02:54:46.820
As far as I'm aware they they pay their employees a bit more decently

02:54:47.540 --> 02:54:51.060
Or probably publicity stunt. I have yet again fallen for you know, have you?

02:54:51.540 --> 02:54:53.540
Um

02:54:54.340 --> 02:54:56.340
Oh

02:55:08.580 --> 02:55:14.980
No, do not tap it. Okay. Sorry. I'll just test them because I keep overheating the poor guy, but

02:55:16.260 --> 02:55:22.740
Just the should men use it. Yep. It's just a generic shampoo bar. It's called jumping juniper on the lush website

02:55:23.220 --> 02:55:27.940
It is literally, um, you put it on your head as you're in the shower or in the bath

02:55:28.340 --> 02:55:32.820
And it lathers up and then that's you dunzel. Um, open the door though

02:55:33.700 --> 02:55:35.700
Oh hacker man, we're in

02:55:38.820 --> 02:55:40.820
Oh, we've done it now

02:55:44.340 --> 02:55:46.340
What the

02:55:47.300 --> 02:55:49.300
Oh

02:55:50.980 --> 02:55:56.660
Is he gonna send an up? Okay. Yeah, he doesn't like it. I don't like it either

02:55:58.900 --> 02:56:01.300
Oh my god, they just send more what the

02:56:02.100 --> 02:56:04.100
break

02:56:05.700 --> 02:56:13.140
Bruh, bruh, no, no, no, that's outrageous. Sorry. That's outrageous. Yeah, no wonder I'm fucking dead. What the fuck was that?

02:56:16.740 --> 02:56:18.740
I

02:56:20.340 --> 02:56:22.340
Saw is that was outrageous

02:56:27.860 --> 02:56:33.700
And it reloaded all of those freaking egg sacs that are in my way, so I need to destroy them all so I can get a clear

02:56:36.740 --> 02:56:38.740
And I'm gonna overheat again

02:56:39.300 --> 02:56:41.300
I

02:56:44.420 --> 02:56:50.900
Huh, right, so what I need to do I need to be able to wait. I can't even run across there super easily

02:56:50.980 --> 02:56:54.020
I have to go down here and do a u-turn

02:56:59.380 --> 02:57:01.380
That's ridiculous

02:57:03.220 --> 02:57:05.700
If you're gonna give me a battery that like

02:57:08.980 --> 02:57:10.980
I

02:57:15.300 --> 02:57:18.020
At least make it last that's all I'm asking seriously

02:57:18.660 --> 02:57:22.980
If you're gonna give a weapon to defend yourself, then you make like some fucking stupid ass

02:57:23.700 --> 02:57:25.700
map like that

02:57:29.460 --> 02:57:33.620
I'm sure there's probably some tactics I've not figured out yet, but that was really annoying

02:57:33.780 --> 02:57:36.820
That was like, okay. Yeah, just keep sending it. Okay, great. Thanks

02:57:39.300 --> 02:57:49.060
All right, let's hopefully we don't mess up this time. I'll start on this end because why not and what difference does it make?

02:57:53.300 --> 02:57:55.300
He's already awake

02:58:04.020 --> 02:58:06.520
Hold on. Sorry, I'm tryharding. I'm actually tryharding

02:58:09.620 --> 02:58:15.220
I'm actually fucking tryharding and a fucking cat game. Please open the bloody thing

02:58:20.820 --> 02:58:23.860
Wait, I could just use these barrels and jump across and I've been done

02:58:26.580 --> 02:58:28.580
I was those barrels not available

02:58:29.940 --> 02:58:33.460
Go right. You don't have to tell me twice to get the heck out. Oh for

02:58:33.460 --> 02:58:38.020
What and the F

02:58:45.540 --> 02:58:47.780
Hey, I'm feeling a bit intimidated as well. I ain't gonna lie

02:58:51.300 --> 02:58:53.300
We are being perceived

02:59:03.700 --> 02:59:05.700
I

02:59:16.740 --> 02:59:22.660
Uh, oh, please don't cut to me. Please don't cut to me. Oh, I cut to me and cut to me

02:59:23.460 --> 02:59:25.460
Oh

02:59:29.540 --> 02:59:33.220
I cut to me. Why did you cut? Why can't I not just have been a cute little cutscene?

02:59:33.700 --> 02:59:39.140
Well, I've been to if it was just an adorable little cutscene of how fast I can run and I didn't have to do this section

02:59:39.940 --> 02:59:44.900
Oh, wouldn't that be adorable? Oh, that'd be so kawaii-ne, kawaii-ne, kawaii-ne, kawaii-ne, so kawaii-ne

02:59:45.540 --> 02:59:47.540
Kawaii, kawaii, kawaii, kawaii, kawaii, kawaii, kawaii

02:59:47.540 --> 02:59:49.540
Oh

02:59:56.260 --> 03:00:01.860
I'm literally just spam and be an anticipation of them launching onto my room and butt crack

03:00:02.820 --> 03:00:04.820
Please

03:00:05.380 --> 03:00:10.260
Please don't make me frickin go back. Don't make me do that again. Oh god

03:00:10.580 --> 03:00:17.540
That was awful. Can we get an upgrade on the duration of this little bad boy, please?

03:00:19.300 --> 03:00:24.500
Wake up. Don't leave me alone. Please. I'm too scared to play this game alone now that I have you

03:00:26.100 --> 03:00:28.900
Literally be 12 more like be reflin get it?

03:00:29.780 --> 03:00:33.860
It was dark. I was alone. I felt like I was back in the network, but you saved me

03:00:33.860 --> 03:00:37.460
Thank you friend. Enjoying that much power was rough on my core. The defluxer is completely

03:00:40.260 --> 03:00:46.580
I was just praising this game for freaking not having to run away

03:00:50.820 --> 03:00:57.620
I'm stressed. I thought this was supposed to be a cute cat game and I'm so stressed

03:00:58.980 --> 03:01:02.340
Wait, you didn't hack it. Oh, you did hack it. Hold on. Oh, let's go before the fan goes on

03:01:02.900 --> 03:01:04.900
Right, so we are

03:01:05.780 --> 03:01:10.500
It's a flying refling. Yeah, you're literally gated me through the game. Yeah, yucky toxic

03:01:12.740 --> 03:01:16.660
Okay, we can't say remember we can't say we can't say

03:01:21.700 --> 03:01:25.780
Oh, hello friend, that means no enemies. Hello

03:01:26.820 --> 03:01:28.820
Oh, hi, yo

03:01:29.140 --> 03:01:34.260
A traveler from the sewers you haven't seen one of you in ages. Are you the one who contacted? Yes. I'm little

03:01:34.900 --> 03:01:39.700
Zanzibar the outsider has been expecting you. He's meditating at the top of her village

03:01:41.540 --> 03:01:43.540
Whoa

03:01:46.580 --> 03:01:48.580
Huh

03:01:48.660 --> 03:01:54.660
Wait, can they see the can they see the sky? Oh, sorry, we're gonna cut scene my apologies

03:01:59.140 --> 03:02:02.420
I am sure that would be the last of them surely copium

03:02:03.380 --> 03:02:10.500
Uh praying that the fluxer can be fixed the machine the scientist I insisted used one of these

03:02:12.740 --> 03:02:20.900
He was sick. This was the last hope he walked into the machine, but I wasn't with him. He was alone. What was he doing?

03:02:22.580 --> 03:02:27.700
Cryopods he uploaded himself into the computer and then everything was different

03:02:27.860 --> 03:02:29.860
The

03:02:31.540 --> 03:02:33.540
Bots aren't bots at all. They're humans

03:02:35.460 --> 03:02:42.820
But the upload something went wrong. He was stuck for hundreds of years until a little cat appeared you

03:02:45.060 --> 03:02:47.060
You're a human in a bot

03:02:48.420 --> 03:02:55.860
Oh, no, he got a dolly zoom effect. It was me. I was the scientist

03:02:57.700 --> 03:02:59.700
I was human

03:03:02.100 --> 03:03:05.380
I need a moment. Oh, you are human

03:03:10.820 --> 03:03:14.740
Maybe the world was dying so you had the choice to become a ball

03:03:16.740 --> 03:03:18.740
Hello

03:03:19.380 --> 03:03:21.380
Oh, you're covered in paint

03:03:22.020 --> 03:03:24.020
Scratch board

03:03:24.580 --> 03:03:26.740
Hello, oh, what are you playing?

03:03:27.860 --> 03:03:34.820
What is this? Mahjong? Mahjong? Oh like they've got a little spot for me to play. Can I play?

03:03:38.020 --> 03:03:41.220
I'm so sorry. Oh, no, I'm so sorry

03:03:42.580 --> 03:03:46.500
Are you actually mad at me? Can I make it up to you? Can I rub against your leg? I'm sorry

03:03:47.140 --> 03:03:50.100
Oh, no, they're actually picking up the pieces. I'm so sorry

03:03:51.460 --> 03:03:54.020
Sorry, it wasn't my intention

03:03:54.980 --> 03:03:56.980
Member? Oh, we've got a member

03:03:58.900 --> 03:04:02.900
You render scrabble? I'm so cat-like. I'm sorry. I

03:04:04.820 --> 03:04:07.300
I need a moment. I don't feel like talking right now. Okay

03:04:09.300 --> 03:04:13.940
Yeah, that's probably a lot to process. I'm not gonna lie

03:04:16.180 --> 03:04:21.300
That's a unique tea tree top. Maybe we don't need a farm roof lens. Maybe we just need a tree top

03:04:24.020 --> 03:04:30.740
And we can all have different levels and stuff. Although I might get a bit chilly. So I think we'd I think maybe the farm would keep us warm

03:04:31.620 --> 03:04:34.020
I think a tree top open like this would be too cold

03:04:36.020 --> 03:04:38.020
What else have I forgotten?

03:04:38.900 --> 03:04:44.260
I must have had parents friends. What happened to everyone? I wanted to open the city

03:04:44.260 --> 03:04:50.580
But is there anyone else left to save? Oh, don't doubt your mission now soldier. Oh wait, we need to find this, sorry

03:04:51.540 --> 03:04:58.980
Zanzibar, we need to talk to you friend wherever you are. Oh, you're bloody Zanzibar. He's a hippie

03:05:01.140 --> 03:05:03.140
Oh, they got the fortune cat teller

03:05:04.420 --> 03:05:08.340
That's it. I'm getting Chinese. Where's my Chinese auntie? What is this?

03:05:10.260 --> 03:05:12.260
I've got a jump scare

03:05:12.980 --> 03:05:14.980
Eh?

03:05:15.780 --> 03:05:19.940
This is Zanzibar. Hey, don't you know not to interrupt a fellow during his

03:05:21.220 --> 03:05:22.740
Transcendental

03:05:22.740 --> 03:05:24.340
Transcendental

03:05:24.340 --> 03:05:30.340
Meditation. Oh, it's you. You're with Momo when we received that call earlier. I'm glad to meet you at last little outsider

03:05:30.340 --> 03:05:36.900
Eh, that's in you. You know Momo and Doc. So you're already familiar with those outsiders. I miss them. Their memories bring me peace

03:05:37.380 --> 03:05:42.740
Momo stayed in the slums. I heard you helped find the doctor and clementime

03:05:42.820 --> 03:05:45.860
She's in midtown now. If you still want to see the outside

03:05:46.340 --> 03:05:48.340
She's the one you can go to

03:05:48.580 --> 03:05:50.580
You that can get you there

03:05:50.980 --> 03:05:57.380
Apparently she had some kind of plan to leave the city here. Now take this. I wrote her address on the back of this picture

03:05:58.900 --> 03:06:04.020
Okay, I'm sorry. I just teared myself in on that mono-controller hydration check

03:06:06.900 --> 03:06:13.700
To reach midtown claim up our little village. It should be easy for your oh for a dexterous one like you

03:06:14.820 --> 03:06:19.700
If you manage to reach the outside you will be the very first. I wish you good luck, but you don't need it

03:06:19.780 --> 03:06:21.780
I believe in you. Oh

03:06:22.500 --> 03:06:24.500
Does he predict that we make it?

03:06:25.380 --> 03:06:29.620
I'm sorry for shutting down earlier. I'm human probably the last in the world

03:06:30.020 --> 03:06:34.580
Now look what's left of me so much has come back to me. How much have I forgotten?

03:06:34.820 --> 03:06:40.420
Maybe if we find clementime, we can restore my memories and get you back home at the same time

03:06:40.580 --> 03:06:45.220
We can go back down and find out more from the companions or head onwards

03:06:46.980 --> 03:06:48.980
um

03:06:50.020 --> 03:06:52.340
I think we just press onwards to be honest

03:06:53.460 --> 03:06:55.300
I know you can

03:06:55.300 --> 03:06:59.700
Someone said you can a hundred percent this game if it's like just hundred percent with memories like

03:07:00.740 --> 03:07:02.740
Sorry, I've gone it. She knows

03:07:03.700 --> 03:07:08.420
The Japanese golden cat also known as the beckoning cat typically depicted as a cat with one piece

03:07:08.580 --> 03:07:11.140
Paul raised believe to bring good luck and fortune to them

03:07:12.580 --> 03:07:14.260
Oh, we can play darts

03:07:14.260 --> 03:07:17.300
I'm thinking it'd be a bit hard. I don't have a poseable thumb

03:07:17.620 --> 03:07:18.820
Hi

03:07:18.820 --> 03:07:25.780
What we cooking back here good-looking all the boulder recipes. That's so smart. Honestly. That's so smart

03:07:26.820 --> 03:07:28.820
All right, you ain't getting that idea. I don't even

03:07:28.820 --> 03:07:30.820
know

03:07:31.060 --> 03:07:33.060
Uh, where was that ladder? I just saw other

03:07:36.740 --> 03:07:39.700
It's also just nice to chat with the people if we aren't going for a hundred percent

03:07:41.620 --> 03:07:44.740
Maybe I should maybe I should be a bit more social in this game

03:07:45.860 --> 03:07:50.580
Okay, let's talk to the next person. Oh, you're a gardener. You're a leafling

03:07:52.180 --> 03:07:56.740
Hello, buddy. How are you? Did you know that aunt clementine taught us how to grow?

03:07:57.540 --> 03:08:03.380
Special plants that can live without sunlight. I have a huge collection. Do you want to see I still miss some of the colors though

03:08:03.700 --> 03:08:04.580
I miss

03:08:04.580 --> 03:08:08.980
Seeing a yellow a red and a purple. It's only someone small and agile. Okay. Okay

03:08:09.700 --> 03:08:13.300
I get it. No, I don't think I can get it for you

03:08:14.340 --> 03:08:16.340
There are you

03:08:16.500 --> 03:08:22.500
I'm bored aunt clement used to hold classes. We learned so much cool stuff. Maybe you'll learn anything now

03:08:22.500 --> 03:08:24.500
Please

03:08:24.580 --> 03:08:26.580
Don't you that made that noise?

03:08:31.460 --> 03:08:37.540
I hear in that I'm getting trolled by this game. I guess if I claim up that's not where I'm supposed to go

03:08:40.580 --> 03:08:42.580
There's a bucket of paint

03:08:45.140 --> 03:08:48.100
Wait that's how we're coloring the flowers with paint

03:08:50.100 --> 03:08:52.100
Anyone let me go across

03:08:53.380 --> 03:08:55.380
Oh, well, no

03:08:55.940 --> 03:08:57.940
You want paint?

03:08:59.540 --> 03:09:03.460
Is this um, I just trash in the place because I don't understand what I'm doing

03:09:06.900 --> 03:09:08.900
Up up

03:09:09.220 --> 03:09:11.620
Oh, that was the last the food I could talk to

03:09:12.260 --> 03:09:15.860
Literally the last tip. I'll be more social the last two people. Bye

03:09:16.980 --> 03:09:18.980
I'm not getting you your flowers

03:09:19.380 --> 03:09:24.500
Uh, we're getting a bit dangerous. I don't like this

03:09:25.860 --> 03:09:30.340
Please be careful little munchkin. You're making me nervous claiming this high

03:09:32.260 --> 03:09:34.260
Okay, okay, I see

03:09:35.940 --> 03:09:39.460
Knocking things over because she can I have become one with the cat

03:09:44.100 --> 03:09:46.600
I know I'm not fired because I say meow that's not how it works

03:09:48.980 --> 03:09:52.260
Uh, okay, it still looks safe. Is there like any

03:09:53.060 --> 03:09:58.580
Memory things behind this video games love to spawn you in and be like oh, there's a hidden thing by the way

03:09:59.380 --> 03:10:04.020
Right behind you. We've made it really obvious. Oh, please no enemies

03:10:05.620 --> 03:10:08.180
Okay, I don't see the orange yet. I just see orange clore

03:10:10.740 --> 03:10:14.660
What's the daily over in a subway subway? Yes

03:10:14.660 --> 03:10:23.060
Tell me what's up. Tell me what you're remembering. You remember going to work

03:10:28.180 --> 03:10:33.140
Look, this is the subway station. I have completely forgotten this kind of transportation existed

03:10:33.380 --> 03:10:36.580
You could write to anywhere in the city people used to take it to go to work

03:10:36.660 --> 03:10:41.700
I used to take it to every morning after saying goodbye to my family at home. So you do remember

03:10:42.500 --> 03:10:46.100
I remember I was doing this for them, but they're gone now. It was so long ago

03:10:46.580 --> 03:10:50.100
Yeah, that's probably really rough waking up and being like all your families pop off

03:10:50.500 --> 03:10:55.540
They wanted to see the outside, but does that even matter anymore? What happened to them? What happened to everyone?

03:10:56.420 --> 03:10:59.700
I think it's all went into robots and all robots were technical demons

03:11:00.660 --> 03:11:02.020
I don't know

No, he just pretends not to hear me every time I try to confront him

03:37:29.600 --> 03:37:34.480
If it wasn't for the sentinels on patrol, he'd end up with spare parts. Honestly, that's not true

03:39:11.760 --> 03:39:13.200
Uh

03:39:13.200 --> 03:39:16.320

Told you five times you all she can't run around like that as dangerous. Hey, this is the first time seen this kind of robot

03:39:39.760 --> 03:39:41.440
You're so fluffy

03:39:41.440 --> 03:39:46.560
Oh a guy wearing a bomber jacket and a gold chain. I don't know what you talked about you can check

03:39:51.600 --> 03:39:56.400

Okay, I can do that

03:39:58.800 --> 03:40:00.800

Bomber jacket and a gold chain, not you wait you've got a chain around your neck

03:40:14.560 --> 03:40:20.480
What uh truly makes a robot unique if it's ones and zeros can it so be duplicated

I'm busy. What do you want get me in? Where did you get that? You're my contact? Oh, you're without my contact

03:40:36.160 --> 03:40:38.240
Let me make it brief

03:40:38.240 --> 03:40:42.800
You oh, sorry. Let me breathe my brain just completely just made up a sentence. I wasn't even there

03:40:43.440 --> 03:40:45.680
Let me brief you about the atomic battery

03:40:48.880 --> 03:40:52.560
The battery is powering the necocorp factory right there

03:40:52.880 --> 03:40:59.760
But this whole area is restricted and heavily guarded. They check every person who enters and turns away anyone who is not a worker

03:41:02.400 --> 03:41:04.400
Here's the knife

03:41:04.400 --> 03:41:07.040
Okay, am I doing everything backwards?

03:41:08.240 --> 03:41:12.880
Am I was I supposed to talk to him first and then grab all this stuff because I've already got it

03:41:12.880 --> 03:41:14.880
I keep like stumbling

03:41:14.960 --> 03:41:18.320
You'll never guess. Yeah, you know, I've got you this perfect

03:41:19.280 --> 03:41:21.280
Yes, I have it too

03:41:21.840 --> 03:41:24.240
I'll get dressed now mine turning around sure

03:41:25.680 --> 03:41:29.600
I keep stumbling into the plot. This is amazing. I like this game

03:41:29.920 --> 03:41:35.680
I like games that let you accidentally progress without meaning it. These are great a little snug around the waistline build it

03:41:35.680 --> 03:41:38.960
Okay, hop in the box. I'll sneak you across the checkpoint. Okay, got it

03:41:40.640 --> 03:41:42.240
I'll take it

03:41:42.240 --> 03:41:44.240
Oh and sorry

03:41:44.800 --> 03:41:46.800
The unintentionally speedrunning

03:41:47.040 --> 03:41:50.800
I mean, I like freaking I like games that let you accidentally progress

03:41:50.800 --> 03:41:55.920
Like the one thing I dislike about assassin's creed brotherhood is you don't have access to the entire map

03:41:56.400 --> 03:42:01.920
Which is frustrating because it would be nice if you could do like all the borja towers in one swoop

03:42:02.240 --> 03:42:04.800
But you would be very op at the start of the game

03:42:04.880 --> 03:42:09.840
But I like games that give you access to the full thing and don't like hold back or anything

03:42:10.160 --> 03:42:12.160
Oh

03:42:13.680 --> 03:42:17.280
I'm being inspected hold on inspection ASMR

03:42:22.000 --> 03:42:24.000
Okay

03:42:32.640 --> 03:42:35.280
Oh, there's freaking robots I can see me hold on

03:42:36.240 --> 03:42:38.240
Oh

03:42:38.880 --> 03:42:44.720
No, right. Okay. I understand. I understand. I understand

03:42:46.240 --> 03:42:48.720

03:42:53.520 --> 03:42:55.520
Oh fuck send it send it

03:42:57.600 --> 03:43:00.720
Hiding the box I need to see okay. That was lucky

03:43:02.160 --> 03:43:04.160
That one on the bridge is blocking me

03:43:05.520 --> 03:43:07.520
Oh

03:43:07.760 --> 03:43:11.920
I see the barrels. Okay. I see the barrels my apologies. I see them to the left to the left

03:43:17.680 --> 03:43:21.760
Oh, uh, no such thing no such thing

03:43:23.120 --> 03:43:25.120
Hey

03:43:25.200 --> 03:43:26.720
Hey good thing you're here. You can help me

03:43:26.720 --> 03:43:29.200
I lost the keys to this place in the dark and huge factory

03:43:29.520 --> 03:43:32.960
The senators refused to help me. They told me if no place to go more work here

03:43:33.760 --> 03:43:40.880
If by any chance you could help me find that might be so grateful. Yeah, cool. How far did you drop it?

03:43:41.680 --> 03:43:43.680
This place is very

03:43:44.080 --> 03:43:46.080
Oh, no

03:43:49.360 --> 03:43:53.280
You just do the same thing, okay, okay, okay

03:43:56.960 --> 03:44:00.320
That's water so we can't do that hold on wait, how'd I get down?

03:44:03.200 --> 03:44:12.320
That's too big of a jump for my little ankles. That's water so I'm gonna drown wait, hold on

03:44:14.400 --> 03:44:18.880
It's over here. Oh, I see a jump. Okay. I see a jump

03:44:22.480 --> 03:44:26.880
Right, so what is going here achieve a lever? Oh

03:44:26.880 --> 03:44:28.880
Oh

03:44:30.080 --> 03:44:32.080
Unlocked more sentries

03:44:32.320 --> 03:44:36.080
So real let's play or choose how you want to play just options for handholding. Yeah

03:44:37.280 --> 03:44:39.280
I can't get back

03:44:39.760 --> 03:44:41.760
I can get back on this side

03:44:46.880 --> 03:44:49.360
Yeah, so I can be detected a little bit

03:44:49.760 --> 03:44:59.040
Okay, okay, okay next one and then run to the left got it got it got it

03:45:00.480 --> 03:45:06.720
Oh wait, the sentry drones are to make sure the robots are working properly. Oh, oh, oh, oh

03:45:08.160 --> 03:45:09.840
Okay

03:45:09.840 --> 03:45:14.400
Or I guess or just eyes on the production line

03:45:14.960 --> 03:45:22.160
Okay, okay, okay, okay. I was try hard in there. I'm not gonna lie

03:45:29.920 --> 03:45:35.920
Whoa, I'm guessing I can't that tiny slither

03:45:39.520 --> 03:45:41.520
Well, I'm glad he's stationary

03:45:42.240 --> 03:45:44.240
That's tiny though

03:45:45.360 --> 03:45:50.720
I'm good, but I'm not like it. So you think I'm kidney

03:46:04.480 --> 03:46:10.000
Do you know where a pair of keys are? Oh, you don't want to talk to me. I'm sorry. He's hard at work. It's fine

03:46:10.720 --> 03:46:12.720
Oh

03:46:14.960 --> 03:46:21.520
No, the barrel stops us from getting laser beams. Oh the camera isn't even on

03:46:24.000 --> 03:46:26.400
Oh that okay, okay

03:46:28.320 --> 03:46:30.320
What was that

03:46:34.080 --> 03:46:36.080
I'm in the headquarters

03:46:36.720 --> 03:46:40.880
Stony trial try hard with my trial game. I don't want to step on

03:46:47.600 --> 03:46:49.600
Oh, no, it's a puzzle

03:46:51.680 --> 03:46:53.680
Turn on

03:47:07.040 --> 03:47:13.280
Wait, what? Oh no, I actually have to do a puzzle. Oh jump over here. Okay

03:47:17.440 --> 03:47:19.440
Okay

03:47:21.280 --> 03:47:23.280
Oh, there's another one. Okay, okay, okay

03:47:24.720 --> 03:47:29.120
How do I turn it on? Oh, I sorry. I meant how did I get out right?

03:47:29.520 --> 03:47:36.240
Okay, so come yeah, and then you come on this one

03:47:38.080 --> 03:47:40.080
And then you stop

03:47:40.720 --> 03:47:42.720
And then you come with me

03:47:44.720 --> 03:47:48.720
And then you'll lift up the barrel with your weight

03:47:50.720 --> 03:47:54.720
And then I can roll the barrel over the fumatic tube type thing

03:47:54.720 --> 03:48:03.120
Yeah, and then that's all three done. You know for a cat. I'm awfully smart to even have this perception

03:48:05.360 --> 03:48:07.360
Stony move hiding in a box

03:48:12.400 --> 03:48:18.160
The part we need can I just take it? Okay, I was gonna say um

03:48:18.400 --> 03:48:20.400
Oh

03:48:21.040 --> 03:48:23.040
Production line stopped

03:48:23.600 --> 03:48:25.600
We're taking down the high table

03:48:26.960 --> 03:48:31.840
We've got it quick. Let's go here through the centre of the shop. We've got this battery back to clementine

03:48:33.680 --> 03:48:35.680
Is this about to be a run sequence?

03:48:38.000 --> 03:48:40.000
Oh, no, we're fine. Oh

03:48:41.040 --> 03:48:43.040
Oh, that's a smooth criminal

03:48:43.520 --> 03:48:46.160
You've been hit there. Hey, you've been struck there

03:48:46.720 --> 03:48:48.720
A smooth criminal

03:48:51.760 --> 03:48:53.760
Where the heck is clementine

03:48:55.280 --> 03:49:01.600
Uh in the apartment complex which it wasn't down here was it?

03:49:04.160 --> 03:49:07.280
Or was it I spoke to someone around here. Yes

03:49:09.280 --> 03:49:12.880
I need the beatboxer guy like the three guys at the apartment

03:49:14.000 --> 03:49:16.000
Not there

03:49:16.720 --> 03:49:18.720
Where wait

03:49:21.440 --> 03:49:23.440
It's done there

03:49:24.560 --> 03:49:27.440
Do you think the criminals eyeing my collection of vintage cars?

03:49:29.120 --> 03:49:31.120
I don't know what happens

03:49:32.240 --> 03:49:34.240
Nothing makes sense if we can't done

03:49:35.360 --> 03:49:38.240
We're locked off right we're gonna have to go an alternative route

03:49:39.440 --> 03:49:42.000
I assume is what this is pointing to

03:49:42.480 --> 03:49:48.480
We're taking down the high-bot table. Honestly who would have thought the cat would finish through a John Wick started

03:49:50.320 --> 03:49:53.520
I need to like climb off. Yeah

03:49:57.440 --> 03:49:59.440
What is so neon

03:50:00.560 --> 03:50:02.560
My little gamer eyes can't handle it right now

03:50:05.840 --> 03:50:07.840
I really be oh remember, okay

03:50:12.640 --> 03:50:17.920
This spot is nice what I wouldn't give to actually feel the softness of the pillows or the taste of a cold drink

03:50:18.320 --> 03:50:21.840
This drone is useful, but I miss having my own body. I miss feeling. I miss

03:50:22.480 --> 03:50:28.480
Hurting I miss being hungry. I know this isn't helping, but what if we stayed just a little longer? Thanks for listening. I'm ready now

03:50:29.040 --> 03:50:31.040
Oh little buddy. It's okay

03:50:33.600 --> 03:50:36.000
Is this gonna put me down it is

03:50:37.840 --> 03:50:39.440
Hmm

03:50:39.440 --> 03:50:43.040
I don't know how to get into this apartment complex. It's been cut off by the polis

03:50:44.960 --> 03:50:48.480
To see police. I it's actually Gaelic

03:50:49.280 --> 03:50:51.280
and Scott Slang

03:50:51.440 --> 03:50:53.440
Polis is the same

03:50:53.600 --> 03:50:55.840
Yeah, I'm just getting further away from the complex

03:50:58.400 --> 03:51:01.600
Unless I'm to go up here. Hold on wait, maybe I was on the right track

03:51:04.880 --> 03:51:07.040
Looks like I can climb up here question mark

03:51:08.000 --> 03:51:10.000
Not

03:51:11.600 --> 03:51:12.800
Unless

03:51:12.800 --> 03:51:18.000
I'm getting very turned around. I'm pretty sure the apartment complex is like eight miles that way. Let me in

03:51:19.600 --> 03:51:21.600
Let me in

03:51:22.160 --> 03:51:24.160
Let me in

03:51:25.680 --> 03:51:29.920
I don't know what the downstairs neighbors are up to but keep hearing bugs on hammers

03:51:30.880 --> 03:51:32.880
Okay, that's definitely the one I'm supposed to know

03:51:34.320 --> 03:51:36.320
Can we go anywhere?

03:51:37.040 --> 03:51:38.160
No

03:51:38.160 --> 03:51:40.160
Can I go up on that?

03:51:40.800 --> 03:51:42.080
No

03:51:42.080 --> 03:51:46.400
Right, right. I'm in the wrong direction. Hold on. Let's recalibrate our headings

03:51:49.280 --> 03:51:52.240
And if we can go down actually because I'm going the wrong way

03:51:53.120 --> 03:51:57.040
I'll need to check out what the police are doing. I'll talk to all the people at the police the policemen

03:51:57.760 --> 03:51:59.760
police

03:51:59.760 --> 03:52:01.760
Oh

03:52:02.800 --> 03:52:04.800
My god

03:52:04.800 --> 03:52:07.040
Uh, right you talk with

03:52:07.920 --> 03:52:12.240
Hey, you think you can stop us from handling hanging an hour and six

03:52:14.640 --> 03:52:17.040
All this work for nothing. What happened?

03:52:23.760 --> 03:52:28.080
I'm like looking for routes or anything but I'm being prepared

03:52:28.320 --> 03:52:31.760
So does any reeflings know where I'm supposed to go?

03:52:33.840 --> 03:52:36.320
There's bars I didn't there's no point in being inside it

03:52:38.000 --> 03:52:42.640
I want to say I have to take a right because honestly the game was designed for me to take a right

03:52:43.920 --> 03:52:46.880
Hold on or maybe I can like go in here. No, I can't

03:52:48.080 --> 03:52:53.280
You're awesome. There you go. It's hard to figure out like what the game wants you to do when you're

03:52:53.680 --> 03:52:55.680
Then you know where to go

03:52:55.760 --> 03:53:00.800
So because like obviously we can't really use the light theory right now. I was like, oh the light will guide you

03:53:01.760 --> 03:53:03.920
Really the thing's pointing them where I'm supposed to go

03:53:05.920 --> 03:53:07.920
Danger

03:53:08.160 --> 03:53:10.160
I don't believe I want to see it

03:53:12.880 --> 03:53:14.880
Light theory isn't working right now

03:53:16.800 --> 03:53:19.040
And none of those people are talking to me

03:53:20.000 --> 03:53:22.640
The meow will gauge you okay, hold on

03:53:24.080 --> 03:53:28.800
Yeah, I can't talk to you. I'll talk to the people in the bar. Maybe they'll tell me what's up. Hey, can you tell me where to go?

03:53:30.560 --> 03:53:34.960
I've mastered every game that ever existed but can't figure out how this one am I not seeing the whole picture here

03:53:37.200 --> 03:53:39.200
What game snooker

03:53:42.400 --> 03:53:46.720
You need the you need the chalk is that what you need the snooker chalk

03:53:47.440 --> 03:53:50.960
She's overthinking it so hard wait barriers

03:53:54.080 --> 03:53:56.080
Oh for fuck's sake

03:53:57.280 --> 03:53:59.280
Oh, there's sentinels hold on

03:54:00.400 --> 03:54:02.400
Okay

03:54:02.880 --> 03:54:04.880
Okay, what does it do?

03:54:06.000 --> 03:54:09.600
Of course, of course the tiny cat can slip under I'm sorry

03:54:10.880 --> 03:54:13.200
That makes perfect sense and I'll honestly

03:54:14.000 --> 03:54:16.000
I

03:54:16.480 --> 03:54:21.680
Just like I need I forget I need to remember like I'm tiny and small and adorably cute

03:54:30.960 --> 03:54:32.960
You don't move right

03:54:37.840 --> 03:54:39.840
Do you look away

03:54:41.040 --> 03:54:43.040
You do

03:54:43.600 --> 03:54:49.040
What about you I saw you I think I've got time. I've not got time. That's not where I'm supposed to go

03:55:01.040 --> 03:55:05.200
Not here hold on have to use my brain hold on

03:55:07.600 --> 03:55:09.600
Ready, where do you go?

03:55:09.920 --> 03:55:15.360
Okay, it's giving jump giving jump

03:55:18.560 --> 03:55:22.480
Not really a jump is it uh, how'd I go out? Oh

03:55:29.520 --> 03:55:31.520
You move

03:55:34.080 --> 03:55:36.080
You don't move okay, that's fine

03:55:40.320 --> 03:55:42.320
Oh

03:55:49.120 --> 03:55:51.120
Okay, we made it

03:55:51.120 --> 03:55:58.080
That was a some stealth app that meant this game is actually really fair in its gameplay other than oh no, she's like what hello

03:56:02.400 --> 03:56:04.400
Is she up there

03:56:06.880 --> 03:56:08.880
She must be up there

03:56:09.040 --> 03:56:11.280
Or she left me a note being like I've popped my clogs

03:56:18.880 --> 03:56:20.880
Uh

03:56:21.920 --> 03:56:25.440
Am I going crazy did I not just she left me a note

03:56:28.000 --> 03:56:30.160
Look at clue. Oh god, she's hiding somewhere

03:56:31.040 --> 03:56:33.040
Uh claim

03:56:33.200 --> 03:56:38.240
No sign of claim here. Okay. Oh, what's that? It looks like some kind of a coded message

03:56:38.480 --> 03:56:44.880
We're gonna have to play detective to figure out what happened to her. Look for b12 in the cat the answer lies in my stuff

03:56:45.040 --> 03:56:47.040
And then there's four symbols

03:56:52.160 --> 03:56:57.040
What okay, one's a lava lamp. I know that's upstairs the rock is upstairs as well

03:56:59.120 --> 03:57:01.120
Wait that level lamps right there

03:57:01.840 --> 03:57:03.840
I

03:57:06.720 --> 03:57:08.720
Not that level lamp

03:57:10.080 --> 03:57:14.480
Right the level lamp up here and spit is that we think

03:57:19.840 --> 03:57:23.360
There's also a hidden message under the container it says I'm with okay

03:57:24.480 --> 03:57:29.440
And then there was a level lamp up here. Okay. Okay. And then a level lamp up here

03:57:30.160 --> 03:57:32.160
I was level up right there

03:57:36.080 --> 03:57:38.640
Maybe not this level lamp in particular. Okay inspect

03:57:40.080 --> 03:57:43.840
We need a belly last a huge huge huge laugh. Yes, they're coming

03:57:45.360 --> 03:57:51.040
Um, this gem is a medium value in low purity. The glow seems to have been added artificially

03:57:51.200 --> 03:57:55.840
Maybe it's the axis of beacon for us to find something useful bingo. Is it says blazer?

03:57:56.160 --> 03:57:59.920
Okay, am I going crazy, but strongly seems tamer. Uh, I am

03:58:02.400 --> 03:58:04.720
I am non-functioning sleep at the moment

03:58:04.880 --> 03:58:11.600
I basically sleep for four hours after stream and then I sleep before our four hours before stream

03:58:11.840 --> 03:58:17.360
Like I've not had a full sleep in a couple of weeks now, so I wouldn't be surprised if I sound not myself

03:58:18.720 --> 03:58:20.720
So don't be scared

03:58:20.720 --> 03:58:23.280
I can't believe it. My hyper reachable isn't hyper

03:58:23.280 --> 03:58:28.640
Wait, where's the note? I can't I can't remember the other two objects. I'm supposed to find

03:58:30.880 --> 03:58:34.880
No clue here. No, I know I'd what wait, what's the piece of paper?

03:58:36.160 --> 03:58:39.120
Um a cone a cone

03:58:42.880 --> 03:58:44.720
Inspect why not?

03:58:44.720 --> 03:58:49.600
That's all right, right. You find something you don't say into the nature. I'm just clicking exit stuff. I'm gonna be honest

03:58:50.320 --> 03:58:52.960
Oh, I heard the noise you bleep

03:58:56.720 --> 03:59:00.720
You're bleeping at something I don't know what it's in this area

03:59:02.880 --> 03:59:04.720
Sure

03:59:04.720 --> 03:59:10.480
I don't want nothing to have an apartment. It's the way the companion see the humans. That's kind of funny. Oh wait the the cone

03:59:11.440 --> 03:59:15.120
Like something it says come to someone. Okay. Oh

03:59:16.080 --> 03:59:18.080
Right and then one last item which

03:59:18.960 --> 03:59:20.960
What is number one a plant?

03:59:21.040 --> 03:59:23.040
Is it in the kitchen?

03:59:23.600 --> 03:59:26.880
Oh, you're worrying about your sleeping health. I don't know what to do

03:59:28.000 --> 03:59:30.560
I honestly don't oh we love her. Um

03:59:32.000 --> 03:59:33.200
I'm a bit

03:59:33.200 --> 03:59:34.720
Mucked up

03:59:34.720 --> 03:59:36.720
That's not a warren can

03:59:37.600 --> 03:59:39.600
Yeah, it's definitely a warren. Yeah

03:59:39.680 --> 03:59:47.280
I don't really know what to do because I basically pass out after stream, but I don't go full for a full eight hour sleep

03:59:48.560 --> 03:59:51.440
So the only option I have really is to

03:59:52.000 --> 03:59:52.720
um

03:59:52.720 --> 03:59:55.280
drug myself up to force myself to sleep, but

03:59:56.480 --> 04:00:02.560
I've done it a few times now and I keep waking up completely messed up and I don't do the full eight hour sleep

04:00:02.560 --> 04:00:04.560
I

04:00:04.640 --> 04:00:09.600
Can consume cannabis is it a plant? She's one. I think it's a plant. I don't know what plant though

04:00:10.480 --> 04:00:12.480
She's wanting me to look at

04:00:14.080 --> 04:00:16.960
Right you got so many plants in this apartment you can down

04:00:18.880 --> 04:00:21.280
We'll go let me check one more time with the item looks like

04:00:24.080 --> 04:00:26.080
What even is that?

04:00:27.440 --> 04:00:30.240
A seriously is there a plant up here that looks like that?

04:00:33.280 --> 04:00:34.560
I

04:00:34.560 --> 04:00:36.560
Don't know what the item is

04:00:37.520 --> 04:00:42.480
Well, that doesn't sound sustainable. Yeah, the space you're right yourself. Just sleep normally. I can't know that's the problem

04:00:44.080 --> 04:00:46.320
I pass out four hours before stream

04:00:47.840 --> 04:00:54.800
And I pass out four like four hours after I've already inspected you right the heck is this bizarre item

04:00:55.040 --> 04:00:57.040
It's not in the kitchen is it?

04:00:59.360 --> 04:01:01.360
Is up here maybe on the shelf

04:01:03.280 --> 04:01:08.080
But it's a nice level lamp though. I have no idea what this is like was misread and sorry

04:01:08.160 --> 04:01:10.960
I was also writing this message. It reads nightclub. Oh

04:01:17.520 --> 04:01:19.520
What

04:01:19.520 --> 04:01:23.120
Show me the image. No, it's gone. What?

04:01:24.480 --> 04:01:26.480
It looked nothing like that

04:01:28.320 --> 04:01:30.560
Nothing like I don't know what that was

04:01:32.960 --> 04:01:39.120
Um, you sleep four hours and four hours just sleep eight hours straight and you're fine. No, the problem is I wake up

04:01:39.760 --> 04:01:41.760
I don't want to get in trouble

04:01:41.760 --> 04:01:45.440
I I can't sleep for eight hours is the problem

04:01:46.640 --> 04:01:51.040
I could do the only time I get a deep sleep is right before stream and

04:01:51.600 --> 04:01:53.760
Uh, obviously I have to wake up for stream

04:01:54.480 --> 04:01:56.480
so I don't have like any

04:01:57.440 --> 04:01:59.440
Solution to my problem

04:02:00.080 --> 04:02:02.080
Because I need to be meman

04:02:02.560 --> 04:02:04.560
I

04:02:06.080 --> 04:02:08.080
Wait, how did I get over here?

04:02:08.720 --> 04:02:14.480
Um, like obviously it's probably like oh just skip the nap. What? How did I get here? I don't

04:02:16.560 --> 04:02:18.560
Oh, it must have been the wall

04:02:18.720 --> 04:02:23.600
Take a day of rest without streaming. No, this sounds terrible. I know for a fact

04:02:23.680 --> 04:02:26.400
I'll be so mad at myself for not streaming

04:02:26.960 --> 04:02:32.240
That I would be so upset that I wouldn't actually sleep

04:02:32.720 --> 04:02:34.720
And then that would annoy me twice as much

04:02:36.080 --> 04:02:39.200
Um, that would send me into a fit of rage

04:02:39.760 --> 04:02:41.760
Right, how did I get here? Was it you?

04:02:42.160 --> 04:02:43.680
Whoa

04:02:43.680 --> 04:02:45.680
Okay, he's patrolling. It's fine

04:02:48.240 --> 04:02:53.840
Uh, are you sleeping then waking up looking at your phone? No, um, I spoke to my doctor about it

04:02:55.120 --> 04:02:58.880
Um, actually a while ago now, um, and um

04:02:59.680 --> 04:03:03.600
I don't like bring my phone into the bedroom. That's like a big no-no

04:03:04.640 --> 04:03:09.840
I'm allowed to rot in bed like on tiktok or whatever, but I don't bring my uh phone into the

04:03:11.120 --> 04:03:13.120
Bedroom because uh

04:03:13.200 --> 04:03:15.200
it mentalates

04:03:15.200 --> 04:03:20.480
The nightclub the nightclub all the bones through that was freaking hating on me. Yeah. Well now it's my turn

04:03:21.680 --> 04:03:23.680
um

04:03:24.640 --> 04:03:29.360
I'm the police is explaining that cat freaking stole it. Yo, let me in

04:03:31.520 --> 04:03:33.520
It's not for you. We'll wait. Yes

04:03:34.480 --> 04:03:36.720
A brave I don't take braves. What is that anyway?

04:03:38.800 --> 04:03:40.800
Sorry, sorry, I'm not supposed to do that

04:03:41.120 --> 04:03:45.600
I don't think the bouncer's gonna listen. Hey guys, I think we're gonna have to claim at the back

04:03:48.960 --> 04:03:50.960
This

04:03:50.960 --> 04:03:54.080
I do have maybe you could have some days with a gorilla stream instead

04:03:55.280 --> 04:03:57.280
um

04:04:01.600 --> 04:04:03.600
Oh, that's the window I can go inside

04:04:05.200 --> 04:04:07.360
Are they talking? How did I get across to you?

04:04:12.800 --> 04:04:20.160
As long as long term if you collapse with burner and I don't get burner like that I just get like can't sleep

04:04:20.240 --> 04:04:22.880
Oh my god, you're so happy. Can I talk to you?

04:04:24.800 --> 04:04:28.960
Oh, that's a shame. I can't talk to him. Oh as long as you're happy doing your thing

04:04:29.840 --> 04:04:31.840
Hi, mr. Can I come inside?

04:04:33.200 --> 04:04:37.760
Hey, how'd you get up here? You want to party with us here jump in and get a drink? Oh, yeah, come on buddy

04:04:38.880 --> 04:04:40.880
Livian

04:04:41.840 --> 04:04:47.520
Alex was the name of that mpc. I've just shot one of the person listening in right now

04:04:48.480 --> 04:04:50.480
Whoa

04:04:52.000 --> 04:04:54.000
What's this

04:04:55.600 --> 04:05:01.920
Wow, I'm getting blinded. We're just climbing time. Is there like a hidden bit?

04:05:05.120 --> 04:05:09.600
I've never been to like a rave or a party is this what it's like

04:05:10.720 --> 04:05:12.640
Oh

04:05:12.640 --> 04:05:16.240
Hey, wait, there must be like a private room that claims them like back here. Maybe

04:05:18.080 --> 04:05:22.480
Clam wouldn't be in the middle of the floor, right? Surely not. She's literally a bit

04:05:25.120 --> 04:05:32.640
Just sleep well on stream I far in my sleep. I honestly would if I could buy freaking far. Where the frick is claim? Am I going crazy?

04:05:35.840 --> 04:05:37.840
Hey

04:05:39.200 --> 04:05:41.600
Who is it blaze or someone or Blake?

04:05:42.560 --> 04:05:48.960
I'm gonna say where is she you like my mask. I made it the jam the scent on the scans and it looks cool

04:05:52.000 --> 04:05:54.000
You're a very shy dancer

04:05:54.880 --> 04:05:56.880
Who wants to talk to hi

04:06:00.720 --> 04:06:06.400
The access some private business going on it has been reserved for some blazer guy. Yeah, where is it?

04:06:07.840 --> 04:06:09.840
Up

04:06:11.920 --> 04:06:13.920
Up up

04:06:16.480 --> 04:06:22.880
Uh, ask a new shop receipt. Wait, no, I'm still on site wait. I'm trapped wait come down. No down

04:06:25.200 --> 04:06:27.200
Take it up

04:06:28.400 --> 04:06:33.840
Hold on analyzing analyzing scanning location visualizing

04:06:34.080 --> 04:06:36.080
Oh

04:06:38.960 --> 04:06:41.200
Where there's wall here

04:06:44.480 --> 04:06:46.480
God I suck at this

04:06:48.000 --> 04:06:51.040
That looks like a walkway I'm supposed to get all the way around

04:06:52.160 --> 04:06:54.160
How do I get up to it?

04:06:56.080 --> 04:06:58.080
You see that you don't get rated on your birds

04:06:59.520 --> 04:07:01.920
Once you open the floodgate with a farce it's over

04:07:02.480 --> 04:07:05.760
You can never unfar again on stream

04:07:08.160 --> 04:07:10.160
Wait, maybe that was the right way to go

04:07:11.600 --> 04:07:17.360
Oh, it's it. There's not glass. I thought there was glass. Okay. Wait, so how'd I go up?

04:07:19.440 --> 04:07:21.440
Okay, this has to be it

04:07:28.240 --> 04:07:30.240
Um

04:07:32.400 --> 04:07:34.400
So

04:07:42.640 --> 04:07:49.840
Well, I uh, I think my dad's gonna keep me awake so I don't nap after stream basically because you'll be wanting to like go

04:07:51.200 --> 04:07:54.560
And do stuff where the I'm genuinely stuck though

04:07:55.280 --> 04:07:58.400
Can I like climb this wall with my claws or something?

04:07:58.640 --> 04:08:06.720
I'm really turned around in this location. I see I see ladders, but

04:08:08.400 --> 04:08:10.400
Oh for goodness

04:08:15.200 --> 04:08:19.280
Use a lever do you guys have a lever here?

04:08:21.600 --> 04:08:24.160
This is why so I can like interact with it

04:08:25.120 --> 04:08:32.880
Hey everyone DJ Matty here, let's get the party started. Of course someone's been requested by a very questionable friend blazer

04:08:36.080 --> 04:08:38.080
I need a record

04:08:42.880 --> 04:08:45.120
Oh for goodness sake was it that simple?

04:08:45.600 --> 04:08:47.600
Oh

04:08:51.760 --> 04:08:54.320
Okay, it was that simple I'm so sorry

04:08:56.640 --> 04:08:58.640
In my defense, I'm not smart

04:09:03.360 --> 04:09:05.360
Wait

04:09:10.160 --> 04:09:14.560
I need to do it on that side and I need a lever for it

04:09:15.280 --> 04:09:18.480
There's nothing up here

04:09:29.520 --> 04:09:35.040
Oh take the thing okay when the other guy goes what take his record

04:09:37.600 --> 04:09:39.600
Okay, okay, okay

04:09:40.240 --> 04:09:43.760
Surely that's what I'm supposed to do. I don't know why I'm supposed to do that

04:09:45.120 --> 04:09:47.120
I

04:09:48.560 --> 04:09:53.120
Right, I need to wait until he's not doing it and then yonkers record

04:10:00.080 --> 04:10:02.080
He squashed him

04:10:11.520 --> 04:10:13.360
Terrible

04:10:13.360 --> 04:10:15.680
Can you snatch the plate? That's what I thought but

04:10:16.880 --> 04:10:18.880
He's not coming over

04:10:19.360 --> 04:10:22.240
This guy needs to come over and so I can steal the plate I think

04:10:24.080 --> 04:10:29.600
You probably have to do that on both sides to take it. This doesn't even have a lever right? I need to find a lever then

04:10:32.320 --> 04:10:36.880
Oh, where do I find a lever? Do you have a lever for me?

04:10:38.240 --> 04:10:40.240
No

04:10:44.080 --> 04:10:46.080
Whoa

04:10:53.040 --> 04:10:56.640
What how is anyone supposed to know?

04:10:58.160 --> 04:11:00.160
Okay, remember

04:11:00.800 --> 04:11:03.280
Oh, there's no progress down here. It's just a memory thing

04:11:05.600 --> 04:11:09.360
When I was human my friends and I would gather and party long into the night

04:11:09.360 --> 04:11:12.720
Even if we had to suffer the annoying consequences the next day

04:11:13.200 --> 04:11:20.480
It felt good to find joy despite the unaliveable surface and of a ruddery and the underground living conditions became more and more

04:11:21.040 --> 04:11:22.080
squalid

04:11:22.080 --> 04:11:25.280
And the capitalist greed of the companies like

04:11:27.600 --> 04:11:33.280
And the police state created by the sentinels now I remember why we're doing that

04:11:35.200 --> 04:11:37.200
Oh

04:11:40.320 --> 04:11:42.320
Okay, so there's nothing

04:11:42.720 --> 04:11:44.720
Wait

04:11:44.960 --> 04:11:48.400
Let me in the vip right now. I'm on the other side of the door. Let me in

04:11:49.600 --> 04:11:51.600
When I was human

04:11:52.320 --> 04:11:53.760
Yeah

04:11:53.760 --> 04:11:59.840
Everyone's been turned in my theory is that everyone's a human entire robot

04:11:59.920 --> 04:12:03.440
But they forgot or maybe it was taken away by the state

04:12:03.520 --> 04:12:07.040
So the people wouldn't revolt and accept that the surface isn't livable

04:12:07.360 --> 04:12:10.800
Because obviously everyone's a robot now. So of course the surface is livable

04:12:13.600 --> 04:12:18.640
Down with black rock. No, no, no, no, no the sentence is the high table

04:12:21.280 --> 04:12:23.280
Down with the high table

04:12:25.920 --> 04:12:31.040
Tin foil man, right where the thick is this lever take strange drink

04:12:32.960 --> 04:12:34.960
I'm too alcohol someone

04:12:37.680 --> 04:12:41.760
Why would I take a strange drink who would want a strange drink?

04:12:45.920 --> 04:12:47.920
You

04:12:52.800 --> 04:12:57.040
Who would want a strange drink the wink

04:13:00.160 --> 04:13:02.160
Am I getting you drunk

04:13:02.320 --> 04:13:04.320
I

04:13:04.720 --> 04:13:06.720
Want to see you destroy that dance floor

04:13:09.840 --> 04:13:12.720
Who wants a strange drink? Do you want a strange drink?

04:13:14.400 --> 04:13:19.440
This club sucks when I tried to get that stupid VIP room. Can you believe it? I just stole this lever

04:13:20.480 --> 04:13:22.480
If you give me a drink, I'll give you this off

04:13:24.080 --> 04:13:27.520
Oh, thanks. Here you go as prom. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, give me that

04:13:28.960 --> 04:13:30.960
Okay, we got there in the end

04:13:31.600 --> 04:13:33.600
Doing it backwards as always

04:13:34.320 --> 04:13:38.640
Okay, and then jump up on top of this one and then we can get away with it

04:13:40.320 --> 04:13:42.320
Yeah, it wraps around

04:13:48.240 --> 04:13:51.120
Oh, wait, should I do that music thing? Okay, hold on. Let me do the music

04:13:54.720 --> 04:13:58.160
I think it must be achievement like make the club silent is my guess

04:13:58.720 --> 04:14:00.720
No

04:14:01.680 --> 04:14:06.560
Oh, wow. No, um, uh, I must be a I should have picked up a record somewhere

04:14:10.240 --> 04:14:12.640
Yeah, well, okay. All right. Sorry. Sorry wasting time

04:14:14.400 --> 04:14:18.720
Stranny is the master of solving puzzles backwards literally they're picking up all the random stuff being like

04:14:18.720 --> 04:14:20.720
What?

04:14:23.600 --> 04:14:28.880
I'm wondering if I'm supposed to bring in a second record and it like enhances and like everyone dances a bit more I guess

04:14:30.560 --> 04:14:34.640
Is my gander at what is supposed to occur here? Please put me upstairs

04:14:41.280 --> 04:14:43.280
Did he really just pose for us

04:14:45.200 --> 04:14:47.200
Okay, what's going on here?

04:14:48.000 --> 04:14:50.720
Oh light control let there be lights

04:14:53.760 --> 04:14:55.760
Oh, no

04:14:57.120 --> 04:14:59.120
Make that stuff low

04:14:59.920 --> 04:15:01.920
Hello, can you lower?

04:15:02.960 --> 04:15:06.720
No, no, no the other way the other way lower

04:15:08.480 --> 04:15:10.480
And then this one

04:15:12.000 --> 04:15:14.880
I'm in lower. No, you're getting higher

04:15:17.440 --> 04:15:23.440
And then lower. Oh, wait. No, that's a jump across. I jump across now

04:15:28.560 --> 04:15:30.560
Oh

04:15:32.800 --> 04:15:38.320
Uh, I have to admit I did take a lot of time to get there. So I'm not even surprised. He's not just being chilling

04:15:39.200 --> 04:15:41.200
I'm waiting for me

04:15:41.760 --> 04:15:43.040
Hi, buddy

04:15:43.040 --> 04:15:44.240
Hi

04:15:44.240 --> 04:15:46.240
Are you just being teeny here?

04:15:46.320 --> 04:15:48.080
Hi

04:15:48.080 --> 04:15:51.200
I have a very good relationship with the sentinels. I don't understand why people complain so

04:15:52.480 --> 04:15:54.480
You're the first that would be taken down

04:15:55.440 --> 04:15:58.400
For your k your cranes you have committed against the community

04:16:00.400 --> 04:16:02.400
I shouldn't have spoken to that man at all

04:16:08.400 --> 04:16:13.200
Two birds with one stone, you're not as clever as you look little cat. Anyway, not in personal business as business

04:16:16.240 --> 04:16:18.240
How do I blow him up?

04:16:20.480 --> 04:16:22.480
We need Guy Fox's stuff right now

04:16:22.880 --> 04:16:29.280
Business is money and I value money way more than our friendship or camaraderie. They are all yours

04:16:30.160 --> 04:16:33.280
Am I about to do a quick time event? Oh, what do I do?

04:16:39.120 --> 04:16:41.120
I just got a freaking laser beam

04:16:45.920 --> 04:16:51.920
I've got an achievement all cat razz go to jail. I'm in jail. I got the jail the polis got me

04:16:53.840 --> 04:16:57.120
The freaking polis got me getting me out of this cage right now

04:16:57.440 --> 04:17:02.800
Why are you dangling me above a pit as well? What weirdos honestly? I'm just a freaking ginger cat

04:17:03.680 --> 04:17:11.920
Wait, yeah, that's right. Oh no, I'm naked. Oh, I don't have refland with me

04:17:24.640 --> 04:17:26.640
Huh

04:17:27.600 --> 04:17:29.600
I need to get you back

04:17:31.360 --> 04:17:35.680
You can't go on without you. It's too scary. I really am in jail. I've got the jail

04:17:48.080 --> 04:17:52.240
Oh, maybe I was I don't know. Can I reach there? I was

04:17:56.800 --> 04:18:05.120
Okay, rather confusing but I got the I didn't realize we were going down

04:18:11.280 --> 04:18:13.280
Oh my god, they're torturing him

04:18:16.560 --> 04:18:22.160
Uh, I need to get refland and get the heck out of here because what the heck can I claim?

04:18:22.880 --> 04:18:26.880
Must be a claim and location is just jail

04:18:29.680 --> 04:18:31.680
Look at the jail

04:18:35.440 --> 04:18:38.880
Oh, I want you back now. I hate playing the game alone

04:18:39.840 --> 04:18:42.160
You are ironically giving me so much courage to play

04:18:42.880 --> 04:18:46.800
How do I get past you? You don't move. I don't get past you at all

04:18:47.520 --> 04:18:49.520
I

04:18:51.360 --> 04:18:53.360
Can

04:18:58.000 --> 04:19:02.400
I'm not supposed to get caught. I can't that can't be right

04:19:04.720 --> 04:19:07.040
Oh, wait, hold on. There's something here. Sorry

04:19:12.640 --> 04:19:14.640
Oh, they aren't even here

04:19:17.200 --> 04:19:19.200
I don't know when he's gonna come back

04:19:25.040 --> 04:19:32.320
I'm just sending out. I'm just sending out seems like I can hide in here. I think you'll come back to me

04:19:36.240 --> 04:19:39.440
Do you see just turn around? Okay, good

04:19:43.920 --> 04:19:45.920
Very quietly

04:19:47.600 --> 04:19:49.600
Okay

04:19:52.560 --> 04:19:54.560
I go up there. No, I don't

04:20:02.400 --> 04:20:04.400
I gotta claim up in this corner

04:20:06.560 --> 04:20:13.760
Okay, here we go. Oh, no, we don't here we go. Uh, yeah, like that perfect

04:20:14.480 --> 04:20:16.480
Okay, yeah

04:20:17.360 --> 04:20:19.360
Look at that barricade in my safe

04:20:20.320 --> 04:20:22.320
Oh

04:20:26.240 --> 04:20:28.240
Hi, buddy, I'll get you

04:20:30.800 --> 04:20:34.080
Oh god, that's right. We can't even translate we can't speak

04:20:38.000 --> 04:20:40.000
That's called glass on it

04:20:40.960 --> 04:20:42.960
That can scoop my boot in here

04:20:45.200 --> 04:20:47.200
What's this

04:20:48.160 --> 04:20:50.160
Why is the music ominous?

04:20:51.760 --> 04:20:54.480
Please don't do ominous music. I can't handle it

04:20:57.200 --> 04:20:59.200
Grab key

04:21:01.200 --> 04:21:03.920
Uh, there's no shortcut. Let's go around that's okay

04:21:04.240 --> 04:21:06.240
Okay

04:21:06.560 --> 04:21:08.960
This is bleak as heck honestly

04:21:10.320 --> 04:21:13.120
Humans are dead and had to be digitally uploaded

04:21:14.000 --> 04:21:16.000
Hi clan drop

04:21:19.520 --> 04:21:22.240

Help me get refling. I need my backpack

04:21:55.040 --> 04:21:57.040
I hear that

04:21:59.760 --> 04:22:01.760
I can't understand you

04:22:04.880 --> 04:22:06.880
We need to be quiet

04:22:17.840 --> 04:22:19.840
I can't understand

04:22:20.800 --> 04:22:22.800
I

04:22:36.160 --> 04:22:38.160
What are they doing to him

04:22:43.840 --> 04:22:47.360
What are they doing to you they download in your brain or something

04:22:50.640 --> 04:22:52.640
I

04:22:55.760 --> 04:22:59.920
Don't I don't know point am I supposed to go for it you need point and tell me what to do

04:23:03.760 --> 04:23:05.760
What

04:23:09.040 --> 04:23:11.040
I didn't mean to get so ominous

04:23:12.960 --> 04:23:14.960
Where the fuck do you get so ominous

04:23:19.840 --> 04:23:21.840
I

04:23:41.280 --> 04:23:44.320
Need me to go ahead because I'm small and fuzzy

04:23:44.320 --> 04:23:46.320
I

04:24:00.080 --> 04:24:06.320
Don't they manually jump over it? Oh, sorry

04:24:06.320 --> 04:24:08.320
I

04:24:20.480 --> 04:24:26.820
This is a bit much isn't it? No, I'm gonna have to go back out

04:24:27.220 --> 04:24:29.220
I

04:24:34.740 --> 04:24:37.540
Sorry, I'm like sweating. I do not want to mess up the sequence

04:24:50.820 --> 04:24:55.700
I'm just a cat. Oh my god, please relax. Oh my god, please relax

04:24:57.540 --> 04:24:59.540
Oh

04:25:11.540 --> 04:25:15.620
We're refling I'm coming to get you but they're looking at you

04:25:17.700 --> 04:25:20.900
I need to create some sort of whoa, what does yellow mean?

04:25:24.180 --> 04:25:26.180
Attack on sight

04:25:27.780 --> 04:25:29.780

Hey, how'd I get out here?

04:25:49.300 --> 04:25:51.300
How'd I go out there go out the way I came

04:25:56.820 --> 04:26:05.300
Okay, okay, okay, I've got my refill and that's all that's important

04:26:08.660 --> 04:26:10.660
Feel the time

04:26:15.620 --> 04:26:17.620
Steady

04:26:20.260 --> 04:26:22.260
Okay

04:26:23.220 --> 04:26:25.220
I

04:26:33.140 --> 04:26:35.140
Saw that

04:26:36.500 --> 04:26:38.500
Here I'm safe

04:26:41.540 --> 04:26:48.020
I think I did it. I think we did it holy crap. Oh, please give me give me

04:26:53.220 --> 04:26:55.700
Did they reset you buddy

04:26:59.940 --> 04:27:02.900
Talk to me come on is it you

04:27:04.900 --> 04:27:06.900
Let's go

04:27:07.380 --> 04:27:11.780
I felt like I was trapped in my lab computer system again all alone, but you came back for me

04:27:11.780 --> 04:27:14.660
I can't believe it. You're a good friend. Heck. Yeah. I'm a good friend

04:27:16.340 --> 04:27:20.740
I'm so glad that we're all safe together again, but we're not safe yet. We need to find a way out of here

04:27:20.820 --> 04:27:22.820
Can you open that door?

04:27:24.420 --> 04:27:26.420
Wow

04:27:28.980 --> 04:27:30.980
We did it we did it we did it

04:27:33.060 --> 04:27:36.500
Let's get the heck out of this jail. I see a lever

04:27:38.020 --> 04:27:40.020
sugar

04:27:40.260 --> 04:27:44.100
Could I get in there or can I just jump up? No, I can't all right, let's go to last uh

04:27:46.580 --> 04:27:48.980
Hold on the main biscuit uh, uh, hold on

04:27:51.220 --> 04:27:53.220
Wait, you can't progress all

04:27:54.500 --> 04:27:56.500
Neither can I

04:27:56.980 --> 04:28:00.660
This has got glass. You need to break it for me. I need to go up

04:28:01.460 --> 04:28:03.460
again

04:28:04.340 --> 04:28:07.700
Throw a brick at it throw a brick at the glass for me

04:28:10.340 --> 04:28:12.660
Yeah, yeah, yeah, you need to help me progress

04:28:16.580 --> 04:28:18.580
A little vandalism never went too far

04:28:21.540 --> 04:28:23.540
I can already see that. Why can't I hold all these?

04:28:25.780 --> 04:28:27.780
Can you give me a lift up?

04:28:30.180 --> 04:28:34.980
I can't reach you'll have to lift me please. Yes. Yes. Yes. Just like that

04:28:37.540 --> 04:28:40.020
I'll be a second hang in there

04:28:41.780 --> 04:28:44.580
Uh, okay, it's just a lever. There's nothing scary here

04:28:44.900 --> 04:28:51.220
Climb spray base we're not, uh, leaving him behind

04:28:52.980 --> 04:28:54.980
B12 gang

04:28:55.540 --> 04:28:57.940
And I'm getting every comfort in my chair

04:28:58.900 --> 04:29:01.940
The sentinels are broken the way again. They will spot me instantly

04:29:01.940 --> 04:29:06.020
Maybe you can try and bait them into those cells and lock them. Oh, no

04:29:07.300 --> 04:29:09.300
What do you mean bait them into the cells?

04:29:15.300 --> 04:29:17.300
Only see one

04:29:21.140 --> 04:29:23.140
Just him you want

04:29:27.620 --> 04:29:29.620
Just one

04:29:37.860 --> 04:29:43.300
I didn't know they freaking show at me. Holy crap close it close it

04:29:45.540 --> 04:29:49.060
What's around? Oh my gosh

04:29:52.100 --> 04:29:54.260
That really went for me. Are you okay?

04:29:56.340 --> 04:29:58.340
Are you tall?

04:29:58.980 --> 04:30:01.060
Wait claims you can't talk all

04:30:05.620 --> 04:30:12.020
We're cat gaming today we pooding any putters you're my little pooders

04:30:12.980 --> 04:30:14.980
One second

04:30:20.180 --> 04:30:25.140
This per fellow seems like sentinels are ruthless when it comes to defying them

04:30:27.540 --> 04:30:33.380
That's what I feared they have completely erased him no more emotions no more self-awareness no more memories

04:30:33.940 --> 04:30:36.580
Please let's not get caught. No we won't

04:30:37.060 --> 04:30:41.060
All right, what's the deal climb?

04:30:56.740 --> 04:30:58.740
I need a lock of them inside here

04:31:03.620 --> 04:31:05.620
Would it be better

04:31:07.300 --> 04:31:09.300
I need to attract them both

04:31:10.420 --> 04:31:12.420
I'm gonna lock it behind me

04:31:17.540 --> 04:31:24.660
Wait, I'm an idiot. Oh sugar only one came in that's not what we want

04:31:28.580 --> 04:31:32.500
Is it gonna push against the other door if it pushes against the other door

04:31:33.620 --> 04:31:35.220
No

04:31:35.300 --> 04:31:37.300
It patrols inside the dang cell

04:31:39.060 --> 04:31:41.620
Unfortunate I messed that sequence up. Um

04:31:46.980 --> 04:31:48.980
Right, okay, let it out and then do a little

04:31:54.420 --> 04:31:56.820
Wait, was that registering it was inside? Whoa

04:32:01.540 --> 04:32:03.540
One shot

04:32:06.180 --> 04:32:08.180
Seriously

04:32:08.340 --> 04:32:10.340
One shot

04:32:10.660 --> 04:32:12.660
I fucking give me a fighting chance

04:32:13.140 --> 04:32:19.300
I was gonna praise this game, but I kind of be honest with one shot death type stuff. That's ridiculous

04:32:21.540 --> 04:32:26.740
Literally one shot. I mean I get there has to be like an anti like oh this game this game

04:32:27.300 --> 04:32:31.860
It needs to have like it can't just be like super duper easy and all that but one freaking shot

04:32:31.860 --> 04:32:33.860
Like me

04:32:34.260 --> 04:32:36.260
I'm freaking gonna say I don't know if I did that in time

04:32:38.980 --> 04:32:40.980
Again

04:32:44.740 --> 04:32:46.740
So how do I get you in?

04:32:47.940 --> 04:32:50.020
Yeah, don't shoot me again, I guess

04:32:52.740 --> 04:32:56.500
And come inside I guess uh, this is not gonna work

04:32:57.460 --> 04:32:59.460
I did it work

04:33:00.100 --> 04:33:05.060
Oh, thank god. Yeah, the game was nice. That should not have worked, but whatever. I'll take that

04:33:05.860 --> 04:33:11.700
You're a house cat. You're not built for durability. I know I'm a tiny cat, but brav. Give me a something to breathe like a lamb

04:33:13.700 --> 04:33:15.860
Hi, you want to come escape?

04:33:19.700 --> 04:33:21.700
Oh no, they took their brains

04:33:26.500 --> 04:33:28.500
I

04:33:33.220 --> 04:33:38.260
Juked him like a pro honestly, I was like, bro. I'm dying again. I'm gonna start region. Okay. Maybe I take it back

04:33:38.340 --> 04:33:40.740
I was a bit heasty. Okay. I was a bit heasty

04:33:41.700 --> 04:33:43.380
um

04:33:43.380 --> 04:33:47.780
It's fine. I was just a little mad. I'm guessing we can't progress until I

04:33:48.980 --> 04:33:50.980
Yeah

04:33:51.300 --> 04:33:55.060
What are we looking at? All right out you come claim

04:33:57.460 --> 04:34:03.060
Cat versus laser the cat should win it. Yeah, I should have infinite health infinite a ammo

04:34:04.740 --> 04:34:07.860
This door it's only way out this jail. I think I can open it from that control room

04:34:07.860 --> 04:34:10.900
We have to find a way to get access to that room though. Please look around

04:34:15.060 --> 04:34:17.060
Hmm

04:34:17.300 --> 04:34:19.300
There's parkour

04:34:20.100 --> 04:34:25.620
Oh my god, what if the game just let me super easy just have a parkour moment with no enemies that chase me

04:34:26.580 --> 04:34:31.060
Wouldn't that be awesome? That'd be amazing. Wouldn't you love oh keys?

04:34:33.940 --> 04:34:35.940
No keys

04:34:39.140 --> 04:34:43.860
They left the keys in the door hop on the back of the truck you should be able to jump over the fence

04:34:44.580 --> 04:34:46.580
Oh, right. Okay

04:34:47.060 --> 04:34:51.220
That's what I'm saying. I keep accidentally doing the puzzles. I'm like, oh cool keys. What do I do with it?

04:34:51.220 --> 04:34:55.540
I was gonna like take the keys over and games like all right next great jump on back. Okay. I'm on the back

04:34:58.420 --> 04:35:00.420
Whoa, whoa, whoa beep beep

04:35:02.260 --> 04:35:04.260
That's what I saw a woman driver

04:35:04.900 --> 04:35:08.500
Those poor saps are facing a fate worse than death. Mmm

04:35:09.300 --> 04:35:11.300
Would you rather perish or would you like?

04:35:12.020 --> 04:35:15.860
Rather like lose your mind but still be alive, but you're not all there

04:35:17.060 --> 04:35:19.060
Oh

04:35:20.660 --> 04:35:22.660
Please no run sequence

My heart can't handle it. I really can't wait. Please drive it. Please drive us in the car

04:35:30.420 --> 04:35:35.380
Please oh my god, was that my freaking voice that did that noise? Did you hear that? It was like a piercing noise. Oh, I'm stuck

04:35:36.020 --> 04:35:38.740
I'm stuck. I'm stuck climb climb climb

04:35:43.620 --> 04:35:45.620
Wait climb you're not gonna pick me up

04:35:47.140 --> 04:35:49.780
Hello meow

04:35:52.500 --> 04:35:54.500
You forget about me bish. Yeah

04:35:58.820 --> 04:36:02.660
I can get that I literally couldn't get that

04:36:06.100 --> 04:36:08.100
Oh, we got like an actual cutscene

04:36:16.580 --> 04:36:18.580
Oh

04:36:21.380 --> 04:36:23.380
All right, come on, let's go buddy

04:36:24.820 --> 04:36:26.820
You're not coming

04:36:28.420 --> 04:36:32.100
Okay, there's no way we'll we'll make it out of the sentinels on our tail

04:36:32.100 --> 04:36:37.140
I can distract them for a little but you have to go the outsider manifesto says we must go outside at any cost

04:36:37.220 --> 04:36:38.420
I wrote that

04:36:38.420 --> 04:36:40.420
Oh, that's so

04:36:41.140 --> 04:36:44.740
You're one of us now. It's not that everyone has to get the outside

04:36:44.740 --> 04:36:50.900
But one of us has to you've gained an item subway key now go. I'll keep you in my ram little outsider

04:36:53.620 --> 04:36:56.020
Climb run yes drive away

04:36:57.620 --> 04:36:59.620
That's so funny

04:37:00.420 --> 04:37:02.420
Okay, come on you and your mechanic mess up now

04:37:04.260 --> 04:37:07.300
Oh, our friend was here. Oh, no the hippies gone

04:37:08.260 --> 04:37:09.460
And

04:37:09.460 --> 04:37:11.460
Now that is a death

04:37:11.460 --> 04:37:13.460
Flag if I've ever seen one

04:37:13.780 --> 04:37:18.580
I fear you might be correct my dear rifling. I fear you might be correct indeed

04:37:20.820 --> 04:37:25.620
Okay, we've got a subway key now. We're unironically about to drive a train

04:37:27.460 --> 04:37:29.860
We don't put it in this box

04:37:31.060 --> 04:37:33.060
No

04:37:34.260 --> 04:37:36.260
Sorry one moment

04:37:36.820 --> 04:37:38.820
Is it this side we drive? No

04:37:42.100 --> 04:37:44.100
Um

04:37:44.340 --> 04:37:46.340
I'm sure we got given a subway key

04:37:47.460 --> 04:37:51.780
If the death is not on the screen, it doesn't count exactly John Wick 4 momentum

04:37:54.260 --> 04:37:57.300
I read an interview by Keanu Reeves because I was so upset

04:37:57.780 --> 04:38:03.140
And if he apparently begged the directors to make it obvious he had perished

04:38:03.780 --> 04:38:05.780
and I was like

04:38:06.260 --> 04:38:09.860
Because he didn't want any of our arbitrary ending

04:38:11.300 --> 04:38:13.060
Um

04:38:13.060 --> 04:38:16.820
So I guess the scene of him falling down the stairs was it

04:38:19.860 --> 04:38:21.860
I think I'm maybe going back

04:38:24.980 --> 04:38:26.980
Or not at all

04:38:28.900 --> 04:38:34.900
Boo oh neko like no eco not neko

04:38:36.820 --> 04:38:42.500
We're actually going to be a train conductor stop. I'm pretty sure there's a train conductor neko in some

04:38:43.220 --> 04:38:45.700
touristic railway station in japan

04:38:48.340 --> 04:38:52.820
The music's gone all funky. I like your funky beat logo

04:38:59.780 --> 04:39:02.980
Uh, but he's coming back for John Wick 5. Yeah

04:39:03.700 --> 04:39:05.700
Oh

04:39:08.740 --> 04:39:10.740
Train conductor for gen 2 confirmed

04:39:12.340 --> 04:39:14.340
Can I make a sec?

04:39:16.820 --> 04:39:18.820
Show me you take it

04:39:21.780 --> 04:39:23.780
Here's that paper

04:39:25.620 --> 04:39:27.620
We already have a train conductor in gen

04:39:28.020 --> 04:39:30.420
Is that an ac joke omega alone?

04:39:31.300 --> 04:39:36.340
The control room the headquarters you say

04:39:39.380 --> 04:39:41.380
Do you have a ticket to this

04:39:43.300 --> 04:39:46.900
Just stick people love tree what type of train would I design?

04:39:51.380 --> 04:39:54.180
The steam train the scottish stream

04:39:54.180 --> 04:39:56.180
The steam train

04:39:58.980 --> 04:40:01.480
Well this place hasn't been touched by time

04:40:07.700 --> 04:40:09.700
Hello

04:40:11.860 --> 04:40:13.860
Hello

04:40:14.980 --> 04:40:16.980
Hello

04:40:17.300 --> 04:40:19.300
Oh

04:40:20.820 --> 04:40:27.540
They don't have personalities that on the surface enjoy the world's safest city waltz city 99

04:40:30.820 --> 04:40:32.820
There's no robots

04:40:35.140 --> 04:40:37.140
Uh

04:40:40.580 --> 04:40:42.580
Waltz city 99

04:40:43.300 --> 04:40:48.020
Things are out of order though. There's no humans here

04:40:51.220 --> 04:40:53.220
But the robots haven't evolved

04:40:54.740 --> 04:40:59.780
City sealed rules of confinement heavy prison sentence

04:41:01.860 --> 04:41:03.860
City sealed

04:41:05.060 --> 04:41:07.060
Wow

04:41:07.460 --> 04:41:14.740
Greetings inhabitant of waltz city 99 the door leading to the surface is currently locked due to a confinement procedure

04:41:15.220 --> 04:41:21.300
Please refer to any certified engineer inside the control room if you have any requests. Have a nice day

04:41:22.420 --> 04:41:24.900
It's weird when they don't have a personality

04:41:25.860 --> 04:41:27.860
They're just

04:41:27.860 --> 04:41:29.860
Robots

04:41:30.580 --> 04:41:32.580
Okay

04:41:33.380 --> 04:41:35.780
Wow, this is weird

04:41:40.740 --> 04:41:43.380
The control room is closed by some sort of security protocol

04:41:43.380 --> 04:41:48.980
It says that only humans are authorized also says that i'm not considered human. Hey, that's offensive security protocol

04:41:49.540 --> 04:41:52.820
Maybe if we work together we can open this passage way

04:41:55.780 --> 04:41:57.780
Um the control

04:41:57.780 --> 04:41:59.780
It says why

04:42:00.100 --> 04:42:06.180
I'm pressing why but it's not doing it. I need to drag something over. Oh, yes. Yeah, I do. I remember this

04:42:08.500 --> 04:42:10.900
Let's stand on it and see what we can do about this panel

04:42:12.660 --> 04:42:17.220
Um, can we expect some gender bender and models females? No, I'm not like this

04:42:19.460 --> 04:42:21.460
Oh

04:42:21.460 --> 04:42:23.460
Okay

04:42:23.460 --> 04:42:25.620
Yes, good little spreadsheet. Whoa

04:42:25.620 --> 04:42:27.620
Oh, it's like

04:42:27.780 --> 04:42:29.780
I can't scratch it off or open

04:42:33.060 --> 04:42:35.060
Hmm

04:42:35.540 --> 04:42:37.540
I need to throw something at it

04:42:38.660 --> 04:42:42.980
Yeah, there's no gender bender of concepts that are already pre-established like

04:42:45.140 --> 04:42:50.180
All the designs that have been approved so far like unique concepts. How do I open that panel?

04:42:51.140 --> 04:42:53.620
Yeah, can I borrow your tool, please?

04:42:56.500 --> 04:43:01.460
The savings you'll please refer to any certified engineer. Have a nice day. Thank you

04:43:03.220 --> 04:43:05.220
Do you have a tool that I can borrow?

04:43:16.900 --> 04:43:21.460
We started down there that was midtown and there we're up here

04:43:21.860 --> 04:43:23.860
And

04:43:25.540 --> 04:43:27.540
John makes and create with her coffee right

04:43:28.180 --> 04:43:35.140
No, I was very surprised about the new gen two entry. Um, it completely knocked out a previous except the design

04:43:35.220 --> 04:43:41.460
So that was a very I was very surprised. Um, because I had actually enjoyed the

04:43:46.420 --> 04:43:48.420
Open human

04:43:51.620 --> 04:43:53.620
I'm not sure what I'm missing

04:43:54.740 --> 04:43:57.140
Oh, you know what you're actually done

04:43:59.060 --> 04:44:02.740
Oh, yeah, that's right. A little cheeky like cold

04:44:04.100 --> 04:44:06.100
Is it sabotaging?

04:44:07.140 --> 04:44:09.140
Okay, this is my

04:44:10.660 --> 04:44:14.100
Does I need to bring the thing over again? No, it's open

04:44:14.900 --> 04:44:16.900
I

04:44:19.940 --> 04:44:26.340
Chant to go to eat us through the high table. Oh, you've guessed the pot. How do you this is the control room for the entire city

04:44:26.340 --> 04:44:28.580
They controlled everything from here and it's empty

04:44:31.540 --> 04:44:36.340
I remember hating them so much. They had everything clean space limitless power freedom to move

04:44:36.980 --> 04:44:38.980
Little good. It did them

04:44:40.500 --> 04:44:42.500
The plague I remember now

04:44:44.980 --> 04:44:50.260
Everyone was dying and they thought they were above it all they did nothing to help us

04:44:51.380 --> 04:44:56.580
I watched my family die. I felt helpless. I couldn't do anything to save them

04:44:59.140 --> 04:45:02.820
But I can still help you we can still go outside together

04:45:03.380 --> 04:45:06.660
I will carry the memories of humanity and the people I loved

04:45:06.900 --> 04:45:08.900
Oh

04:45:12.340 --> 04:45:19.780
I think we did it anyway, I don't know. This seems pretty end gamey to me not to be dramatic or anything, but I think

04:45:23.780 --> 04:45:25.780
That's it. That's the main computer

04:45:26.660 --> 04:45:28.660
I

04:45:32.980 --> 04:45:35.300
According to the mainframe no one has been here for years

04:45:35.620 --> 04:45:39.700
The whole city is stuck in a lockdown cycle from long ago if we disable it

04:45:39.700 --> 04:45:43.220
We should be able to leave we'll need to bring the rest of the systems online

04:45:43.860 --> 04:45:47.620
These computer holds the data we need we need to turn them on

04:45:48.420 --> 04:45:53.220
While you do that, I'll look for passwords and encrypted keys to get into that system got it

04:45:54.020 --> 04:45:56.020
Yeah, understood

04:45:56.100 --> 04:45:58.100
Okay, turn these on

04:45:59.380 --> 04:46:03.140
I actually really like areas that don't have freaking anything. Oh

04:46:07.620 --> 04:46:10.500
That's me turning it on by walking on the keyboard

04:46:12.100 --> 04:46:14.100
Oh, I can turn the phone. Hell yeah

04:46:15.700 --> 04:46:17.700
Oh, let me jump that

04:46:18.980 --> 04:46:20.820
Okay

04:46:20.900 --> 04:46:24.980
Let's go. Oh, I missed. Sorry. Hold on one moment, please

04:46:28.100 --> 04:46:30.100
And then done

04:46:32.020 --> 04:46:37.940
It worked good job my friend. I found it. I know how to open the city something's off here

04:46:39.620 --> 04:46:41.620
Wait, maybe there's a way around it

04:46:46.580 --> 04:46:48.580
Roof control stage

04:46:51.780 --> 04:46:56.420
There that's the workstation to open the city, but there's several layers of security preventing us from using it

04:46:56.420 --> 04:46:58.180
Okay, that's understandable

04:46:58.180 --> 04:47:03.220
Now we need to do what we do best me. I'll hack the machines and you destroy some stuff. Yeah

04:47:04.740 --> 04:47:06.740
Oh, we actually destroyed the high table

04:47:09.700 --> 04:47:11.780
Oh, so you're hacking what am I doing?

04:47:14.500 --> 04:47:16.500
This isn't destroying

04:47:17.460 --> 04:47:21.460
Okay, hold on there's a symbol here

04:47:26.740 --> 04:47:28.740
Oh

04:47:29.540 --> 04:47:31.540
Get this off

04:47:31.700 --> 04:47:38.820
Okay, I will do my job do gel. Yeah, take this high table. Okay, this one

04:47:42.820 --> 04:47:44.820
In this room

04:47:47.220 --> 04:47:49.220
Um

04:47:53.140 --> 04:47:58.260
Oh, there's a second one. What are you? Why are you like?

04:48:03.140 --> 04:48:06.740
Am I supposed to go up? Oh, the circus

04:48:11.780 --> 04:48:14.900
Okay, and then last but certainly not least

04:48:15.860 --> 04:48:19.620
This one right here, which is connected to this

04:48:21.300 --> 04:48:23.300
Open it up and then say this

04:48:25.700 --> 04:48:31.620
Oh, it's so cute. Yeah, fuck it up. All that practice

04:48:33.220 --> 04:48:35.220
Did I do it?

04:48:37.540 --> 04:48:39.540
Hack, okay, okay, I understand

04:48:40.500 --> 04:48:48.420
Did you take HP damage? Ouch

04:48:52.660 --> 04:48:54.660
It's not what it looks like

04:48:55.380 --> 04:48:59.220
It's not what it looks like. Oh no, we've got to keep going. Okay. It's not what it looks like

04:48:59.220 --> 04:49:02.900
It's not what it looks like. We're totally not doing a hack. Please quick faster faster faster

04:49:03.620 --> 04:49:08.260
Wow, he's taking HP damage, but it's okay. Oh

04:49:09.300 --> 04:49:11.300
I

04:49:11.380 --> 04:49:15.780
Can recharge once yes, yes recharge will recharge you please quick before we get stopped

04:49:17.460 --> 04:49:19.460
Quick quick quick quick

04:49:20.020 --> 04:49:21.620
Wow

04:49:21.620 --> 04:49:25.220
Okay, we're picking up get on my back. I think this no, no, it's not it's not

04:49:26.100 --> 04:49:28.340
Just kind of make the workstation. We can disable alarm. Yeah

04:49:29.140 --> 04:49:34.260
We literally can heal you you're literally a robot. I have terrible news. You're literally a circuit board. We can heal you

04:49:36.820 --> 04:49:38.980
Rift control right go do your thing

04:49:41.860 --> 04:49:43.860
Oh wait, there's

04:49:44.820 --> 04:49:46.820
That's it. We're safe

04:49:48.180 --> 04:49:51.780
Listen I have something to tell you I knew the power requires to disable the city

04:49:52.340 --> 04:49:57.220
Control center would be immense more than the strong body could handle but never the security disabled

04:49:57.220 --> 04:50:01.620
I can take control of the system and open the city overriding it would destroy my software

04:50:09.780 --> 04:50:13.700
Um, I'm pretty sure the software is him

04:50:17.460 --> 04:50:20.500
By made that choice when I hooked into the first computer

04:50:23.380 --> 04:50:26.260
Is he gonna die I can't cry

04:50:28.180 --> 04:50:30.340
I don't want to cry wait no

04:50:31.140 --> 04:50:33.140
And the consequences it could bring

04:50:34.100 --> 04:50:36.100
I'm sorry. We won't see that. It's like no

04:50:39.460 --> 04:50:43.940
I thought I needed to carry on in the memories of humanity to hold on to the past but I

04:50:44.660 --> 04:50:48.580
Can see a future in the companion than you here. Let me take that off

04:50:51.220 --> 04:50:56.500
You are my friend my very bad. Oh, no, why why do they have to make it sad?

04:50:56.900 --> 04:50:59.620
It's literally I gave him a freaking car

04:51:01.220 --> 04:51:04.740
Mine is thank you. No, I don't want the conversation

04:51:07.220 --> 04:51:09.940
No, it's literally I gave him a fucking car

04:51:11.540 --> 04:51:13.940
Why does everything have to be so sad?

04:51:16.500 --> 04:51:18.500
No, please

04:51:19.460 --> 04:51:22.100
Don't make a sweet body roll on the floor

04:51:24.580 --> 04:51:26.420
No

04:51:26.740 --> 04:51:29.220
I thought it was a game about being a wika

04:51:33.220 --> 04:51:35.220
What the heck

04:51:36.420 --> 04:51:39.380
No, we're curling up for a rest next time

04:51:41.940 --> 04:51:43.940
Away

04:51:48.340 --> 04:51:50.340
Oh my god

04:51:51.300 --> 04:52:01.540
No, like literally so it's plug them back in he just needs a wee bit of a more GPU come on a GPU is just a rock

04:52:01.540 --> 04:52:04.820
We tricked into thinking it's literally harvested from the air

04:52:07.460 --> 04:52:09.460
Oh

04:52:12.820 --> 04:52:14.820
Why

04:52:15.540 --> 04:52:17.540
Oh

04:52:28.660 --> 04:52:31.300
I don't feel better seeing everyone

04:52:45.540 --> 04:52:52.740
Do you even see the surface to make it worth it? No, don't put me back here

04:52:56.020 --> 04:52:58.020
Can at least take them with me

04:52:59.700 --> 04:53:04.900
Yeah, no, don't no, no, don't sit down. Can I not take them with me?

04:53:07.060 --> 04:53:12.500
Are you joking I can't even take them with me. Why not?

04:53:15.060 --> 04:53:17.060
I

04:53:18.740 --> 04:53:20.740
Bro

04:53:22.340 --> 04:53:25.540
When the hero never gets the good ending honestly

04:53:31.780 --> 04:53:36.100
The city is actually open you can freely get in and get out

04:53:37.540 --> 04:53:42.980
Why does it say like that this city is actually open? There's an old way to freeze it

04:53:44.820 --> 04:53:46.820
Oh

04:53:48.100 --> 04:53:50.100
Oh, I'm gonna see my buddies at least

04:53:52.740 --> 04:53:54.740
Now there's pigeons and shit I can eat

04:53:59.700 --> 04:54:02.200
And my friends here I'm calling for them

04:54:15.780 --> 04:54:17.780
Oh

04:54:39.940 --> 04:54:41.940
Wait, was that him

04:54:42.900 --> 04:54:48.340
Was he uploaded into the mainframe was that him at the left?

04:54:52.260 --> 04:54:54.260
Was that him

04:54:59.220 --> 04:55:01.220
Despite that you're still just the cat

04:55:02.020 --> 04:55:06.900
I don't like when you cry I fucking can't stand why do the games have to be so mean?

04:55:06.980 --> 04:55:11.700
Why can't it just always be a happy ending? I mean like shit cameo is a happy ending

04:55:11.940 --> 04:55:13.940
Like fuck me man

04:55:15.380 --> 04:55:18.900
Thank you dimsy dan for the cat sticker the neck with sticker

04:55:20.100 --> 04:55:25.940
They are just old home humans kopium. He took control of the system the drone got fried, but he's up like done in the system

04:55:25.940 --> 04:55:31.780
Yeah, so there's their stray two coming out and then we can like shove them in a robot and then we live happily ever after

04:55:34.500 --> 04:55:36.500
Oh

04:55:36.980 --> 04:55:40.900
Whenever you cry it reminds me what a sweet girl you are. I literally cannae handle it

04:55:40.900 --> 04:55:45.540
Like why can't we not just like fucking be pod champ? Have you ever played pokemon mystery dungeon?

04:55:46.340 --> 04:55:49.780
I think so, but I was very young so I didn't understand what was going on

04:55:52.820 --> 04:55:54.820
Wow

04:55:55.060 --> 04:55:57.060
Wasn't a model twitching

04:55:58.980 --> 04:56:01.860
I look like it was the rooms a bit dark so it's probably why

04:56:03.780 --> 04:56:07.700
He lives happily ever after anyway if there's a straight mean he's gonna have

04:56:08.100 --> 04:56:10.420
To struggle for it. Don't cry. No, I'm like

04:56:11.380 --> 04:56:18.180
Why I just wanted to be like one thing. I'm such a crybaby and everyone like literally can't can't beat the crybaby allegations

04:56:18.980 --> 04:56:22.260
Well, that just thought I was supposed to be like this cool neko game

04:56:24.100 --> 04:56:31.140
Um, well, you know you're mucking about and like a post-apocalyptic scenario and it's like oh by the way the person

04:56:31.620 --> 04:56:35.540
That you started with oh the parish and I was like, oh, thanks for that

04:56:35.620 --> 04:56:40.180
That's really gonna brighten up my day after that. No, seriously that I'm so happy

04:56:40.580 --> 04:56:43.860
That the person who helped me through the entirety of the game

04:56:44.260 --> 04:56:50.740
Who helped me translate and speak to all the robots and gave me all this advice and we discovered that was actually a human

04:56:50.900 --> 04:56:54.660
And they were a scientist. Oh, no, that's lovely that they just perished right at the end

04:56:54.980 --> 04:57:00.100
No, thanks for that really really cheered up my day really made my heart speed up. Okay. Yeah, like

04:57:01.460 --> 04:57:03.460
Cute crying mummy cup

04:57:05.540 --> 04:57:10.820
I don't need to beat the embrace the crybaby embrace that emotion. Honestly. Why?

04:57:15.060 --> 04:57:17.060
Oh, can't he handle it

04:57:19.540 --> 04:57:23.860
Oh, but we love her crybaby. Honestly, it's freaking terrible for it

04:57:25.540 --> 04:57:27.540
So out of 10

04:57:30.420 --> 04:57:32.420
Honestly, I have to admit

04:57:32.660 --> 04:57:38.180
That was a very fair game in the gameplay

04:57:39.220 --> 04:57:41.220
my only

04:57:41.220 --> 04:57:42.740
thing is

04:57:42.740 --> 04:57:47.380
Maybe give a directional point to where you're supposed to go

04:57:48.740 --> 04:57:50.980
Then again, I can see the argument for being like

04:57:51.620 --> 04:57:56.580
Look, we've given you signs of where the shops you need to go and I kept stumbling into the puzzle somehow

04:57:58.260 --> 04:58:01.140
But I do it. I think at the start we took a lot of time

04:58:03.380 --> 04:58:06.420
I can hear my fucking neighbour in the garden right now

04:58:08.260 --> 04:58:10.260
I swear to god if he puts on that lawnmower

04:58:11.700 --> 04:58:14.660
She's sobbing hard. No, I'm no I'm no sobbing. I'm all right

04:58:15.460 --> 04:58:19.060
Um our little crybaby seaweed. Honestly

04:58:20.500 --> 04:58:24.020
At least the cat survived. Oh, no, I wouldn't even touch the game

04:58:24.420 --> 04:58:30.100
I'm sure if the cat perished in the game like everyone I would have heard about it and wouldn't even touch the damn thing

04:58:30.980 --> 04:58:32.580
Um

04:58:32.580 --> 04:58:34.980
Now you can't even parley vu with the robots. I know

04:58:36.820 --> 04:58:41.540
Um, are they confirmed that there's a straight to in production? Hold on. Let me check

04:58:48.100 --> 04:58:49.700
Straight

04:58:49.700 --> 04:58:52.900
Let's see is straight to in production

04:58:54.500 --> 04:58:59.700
Not like you see it in the dark straight who is not confirmed as of yet. Wow. I'm surprised

04:59:00.900 --> 04:59:04.260
Sorry, I need to sync up my mouse, but I keep them up, don't I?

04:59:06.820 --> 04:59:12.660
Strony has been keeping the sea salty because of these games. Honestly. I can't stop greeting

04:59:14.740 --> 04:59:20.660
We say greeting in scots. So yeah, Strony that was four hours. So I guess five hours is to 100% the game

04:59:21.460 --> 04:59:25.620
Yeah, I don't I mean, I don't really know what you'd get if you 100% assume just as memories

04:59:26.180 --> 04:59:33.220
I think they're gonna do a different game in the same universe. It is still a pretty recent game. Is it? Oh, okay

04:59:33.460 --> 04:59:36.660
I just remember when it came out. There was like a lot of hype about it

04:59:37.300 --> 04:59:39.300
because like no one expected that

04:59:40.260 --> 04:59:41.620
So

04:59:41.620 --> 04:59:43.620
Yeah, we're learning

04:59:44.580 --> 04:59:46.580
That was cute though. Um

04:59:47.380 --> 04:59:49.380
We'll just say it was 10 out of 10

04:59:49.700 --> 04:59:58.660
For me personally, no, however, I can definitely see this appealing to the masses and being very fair

04:59:58.900 --> 05:00:04.420
Like I think gameplay wise I messed up twice in the entire thing

05:00:04.900 --> 05:00:09.860
And if I knew what was coming up like once I learned what was coming up, I could avoid what happened. So

05:00:10.980 --> 05:00:12.980
Yeah, I don't think it's a

05:00:13.460 --> 05:00:15.460
a wee problem

05:00:16.420 --> 05:00:21.620
Stray came out in 2020. Okay. No game games take like at least three years development at this point

05:00:22.900 --> 05:00:29.620
And I think in 8.5 animation and music was good gameplay was simple, but good story was good

05:00:31.220 --> 05:00:33.220
Story was great

05:00:33.780 --> 05:00:35.060
um

05:00:35.060 --> 05:00:36.740
Yeah, I think that was

05:00:36.740 --> 05:00:40.020
I think it's definitely on the higher for me personally. It's not a 10 out of 10

05:00:40.100 --> 05:00:44.180
However, I can completely see where it's a 10 out of 10 for other people like

05:00:44.740 --> 05:00:49.780
Again fair gameplay wasn't asking me to do like a billion different things at one time

05:00:50.180 --> 05:00:56.260
I'm sure maybe exploring for people that enjoy exploring, but I don't really enjoy talking to NPCs

05:00:56.660 --> 05:00:58.660
um that much

05:00:58.660 --> 05:01:00.660
um

05:01:01.140 --> 05:01:05.780
I know some people enjoy the dilly dallying, but I don't know for that game

05:01:05.780 --> 05:01:09.300
I was like, oh, let's go to the net like let's do the next mission. Let's do the next mission

05:01:09.300 --> 05:01:13.540
Like let's not dilly dally and like stop to talk like I guess cameo is a good example of like

05:01:13.620 --> 05:01:17.460
I did the whole campaign and I only talked to who I needed to to get my fruits on that

05:01:18.580 --> 05:01:24.180
This is definitely one of those games of all time from what I've seen I would give an 8.5 and I don't see a need to play it

05:01:24.900 --> 05:01:28.500
I personally wouldn't replay it, but it is a good game

05:01:29.940 --> 05:01:31.940
The game is pretty lore heavy, is it?

05:01:33.060 --> 05:01:38.180
I think maybe yeah, maybe if you solo explored and you know

05:01:38.820 --> 05:01:45.540
Read everything there was to say and found all the wee secrets and memories and that maybe you know, it'd feel like a bit better

05:01:47.460 --> 05:01:52.100
Yeah gameplay wise it isn't that appealing. Yeah, it's I would say it's relatively easy

05:01:52.100 --> 05:01:58.580
Which I quite I'm enjoying an easy gaming experience these days. Like I'm really addicted to baltro

05:01:58.580 --> 05:02:04.340
But it's so hard not to like slam it down every week. So I'm behaving. I promise there's no baltro for a couple of weeks

05:02:04.580 --> 05:02:09.380
Um, I've really been enjoying stuff that doesn't require like insane reaction time

05:02:10.020 --> 05:02:15.860
Because that's like where I get frustrated. I have to like replay the same mission over and over. I do wish we had our

05:02:16.740 --> 05:02:17.620
aim

05:02:17.620 --> 05:02:24.340
A cutscene where all the cats got together though. That's a bit annoying. I like understand the cats freeing back on the surface

05:02:25.300 --> 05:02:30.420
But I wanted it to see its pals, you know, like is that is that too much to ask for chat noir?

05:02:31.060 --> 05:02:37.220
In a two tail polka dot. Oh, I forgot his name and cally-cally clear. I think

05:02:39.780 --> 05:02:41.780
Stray is one of those

05:02:42.180 --> 05:02:43.380
huge

05:02:43.380 --> 05:02:50.820
Intractable movie type games. I'm gonna not even pretend. I know what that word. We should have baltro Monday. Nah, I've got

05:02:52.020 --> 05:02:57.220
I've planned a little bit ahead of what streams I'm doing when my dad gets here. Um

05:02:57.220 --> 05:03:05.860
I've got an Orwell game. I'm not even kidding. It's like a 1984 game. I'm forcing you to play it with me

05:03:05.860 --> 05:03:08.980
I don't care. I honestly don't care. I'm forcing you to play with me

05:03:08.980 --> 05:03:12.820
And I'm sticking a tinfoil hat on me when we do the entire gameplay

05:03:13.220 --> 05:03:17.220
I need to start using like vtuber assets like this more because the ears are so funny

05:03:19.460 --> 05:03:23.220
Interactable, okay. Yeah, is that a retro game? No, it's like a

05:03:24.180 --> 05:03:26.660
I don't know. You just like click through the text and stuff

05:03:27.300 --> 05:03:29.300
I'll read it out though. Don't worry. I'll read it out

05:03:30.660 --> 05:03:36.100
But yeah, that was good. I enjoyed that. I'm gonna is there any uh veal or girly pops on

05:03:37.460 --> 05:03:41.060
Yeah, I mean the review said the game takes five hours. So

05:03:42.100 --> 05:03:45.540
Uh, I really be stumbling very luckily into that stuff. Uh

05:03:46.820 --> 05:03:51.300
Is there any veal or girls on that I can redirect into just the question

05:03:51.460 --> 05:03:57.700
She be on Elden Ring. Let's effin go

05:04:00.340 --> 05:04:02.500
Let's effin go

05:04:02.500 --> 05:04:07.620
Elden Ring it is time. Rise do you turn is she playing at the proper way or is harem

05:04:08.180 --> 05:04:11.540
Is harem coming into help her or is she doing it the proper way?

05:04:12.340 --> 05:04:17.140
As the development team intended, what do you mean you don't play Elden Ring as a multiplayer experience?

05:04:17.220 --> 05:04:21.220
What are you talking about? It's a perfect multiplayer experience

05:04:22.260 --> 05:04:28.500
That yours are cute. Read them up it. Let us go. Oh, no, somebody save she be. She hasn't summoned anyone yet

05:04:29.300 --> 05:04:36.500
Oh my god, she's so brave. I'm like as soon as as soon as I had access to the summoning circles. I was like

05:04:39.460 --> 05:04:41.460
Come play with mome

05:04:42.660 --> 05:04:47.540
Oh also, uh all my thumbnails are up like all my streams are up for this week

05:04:48.260 --> 05:04:53.300
We are playing the jellybean game, which is called fall guys. So if you don't have fall guys

05:04:53.860 --> 05:04:58.900
Installed please do it for me if you want to play with me. I'd like to play with you. That's okay

05:04:59.540 --> 05:05:03.860
But I know some people don't like downloading the launcher because I think it's an EA game

05:05:04.100 --> 05:05:09.460
And I'm sorry if you don't so it's okay if you don't want to download it and play with me because of the launcher because I know it's a

05:05:10.180 --> 05:05:12.180
thing

05:05:12.180 --> 05:05:14.180
A real pro gamer not like me

05:05:14.340 --> 05:05:15.460
Yeah

05:05:15.460 --> 05:05:18.980
Some girls just like being princess carried in games and some like a challenge

05:05:19.460 --> 05:05:24.900
I think a lot of people will show you in that game. Yeah, but the reeflings get to touch me and get to jellybean pull on me

05:05:24.980 --> 05:05:28.180
Not that I had to make a new epic account

05:05:28.820 --> 05:05:34.020
Hackers tick my your epic freaking account. Wait. Did you spend money on it?

05:05:34.660 --> 05:05:37.540
All downloaded and ready to go. I just don't like fall guys

05:05:38.660 --> 05:05:40.900
We were playing other multi game experiences

05:05:41.860 --> 05:05:44.100
We're actually going to be making puzzles together

05:05:45.060 --> 05:05:49.380
In a week or so, but I'm going to hate what I'm going to make the image

05:05:50.660 --> 05:05:54.020
And I'm going to make it really difficult and I'll see if we can do it

05:05:57.620 --> 05:05:59.780
A bit those of us who have on steam

05:06:00.740 --> 05:06:04.420
I think you can like play with me. No problem because I just give you the code

05:06:05.380 --> 05:06:08.900
Who would hate the fortnite launcher? No, it's a fortnite. It's fall guy

05:06:10.980 --> 05:06:13.620
No money, but I lost some of the free games I claimed. Um

05:06:15.300 --> 05:06:17.300
Shocking

05:06:17.300 --> 05:06:20.500
Puzzles with Johnny. Yeah, but I'm going to hide the screen

05:06:20.500 --> 05:06:25.780
So you don't know what the puzzle is and then I'll give you the link and then we complete the artwork together

05:06:28.020 --> 05:06:29.140
Um

05:06:29.140 --> 05:06:31.300
I had to catch up on Isaac

05:06:31.300 --> 05:06:35.300
So I'm ready for multiplayer when you said this game wants you to suffer. Yeah, you're right

05:06:35.300 --> 05:06:37.780
I remember why I draw oh the game does not

05:06:38.180 --> 05:06:42.100
Want you to win it is a punishing game. Um

05:06:42.900 --> 05:06:45.780
Like I honestly enjoy just playing it casually

05:06:45.780 --> 05:06:49.860
I've not actually hardcore tried to go for any unlocks in a very long time

05:06:50.100 --> 05:06:53.620
I should have showed off my unlocks because I had a I've got two

05:06:54.900 --> 05:06:59.460
Alternative characters that aren't unlocked on Isaac and I keep forgetting to get them

05:07:00.740 --> 05:07:04.980
But yeah, the game does not like you like I'm pretty sure pretty much all my unlocks are like

05:07:05.060 --> 05:07:09.380
I randomly stumbled upon an R key. Um, and then did what I needed to do

05:07:10.900 --> 05:07:16.100
Um, but yeah, that was like a really good experience. Is this freaking shame that I cried honestly

05:07:16.100 --> 05:07:18.580
I'm such a fucking crybaby. Can he stop it?

05:07:19.300 --> 05:07:24.180
Um, but that was really good. Um as for what I'm going to do when I go off lane

05:07:24.900 --> 05:07:28.180
I've got two more ASMR collab scripts to write and then I have

05:07:28.660 --> 05:07:35.860
Officially like given everyone what they need to collab with what I would like them to give me for the collab and then

05:07:37.060 --> 05:07:41.860
I'm going to take a break from doing asking people for ASMR collabs just for a teeny weeny bit

05:07:42.420 --> 05:07:45.700
Um, and then I'm going to focus on my

05:07:46.500 --> 05:07:50.020
sub scraper milestone. Thank you videos. Um

05:07:51.620 --> 05:07:57.780
And also the meme videos we've actually got the pregnancy ASMR comment that sounds bizarre saying that in a sense

05:07:57.780 --> 05:08:02.180
I've got the pregnancy ASMR coming up. I've got hypnotizes you to like, um

05:08:03.140 --> 05:08:09.620
Pineapple on pizza. I hope you can sleep. Yes. Um, I get I'm probably gonna go for a nap

05:08:09.620 --> 05:08:14.740
But it's it's the only way I seem to be able to sleep that minute is go lie down

05:08:15.780 --> 05:08:18.260
And then when I wake up I do a big chunk of work

05:08:18.340 --> 05:08:23.620
Like the girls all had shorts come out today if I'm not mistaken. I think the mercy might have had a short come out

05:08:23.620 --> 05:08:25.620
Let me see one more check

05:08:26.020 --> 05:08:31.860
Um, I ordered a four for a zero one of them, which is absolutely hilarious. I cannot wait for you guys to see it

05:08:33.220 --> 05:08:38.340
Oh, no, the mercy one must come out tomorrow. So it's only a season one that came out. Um, I

05:08:38.900 --> 05:08:42.260
gave any to she is gonna upload it when she wants to upload it

05:08:42.900 --> 05:08:44.180
and

05:08:44.180 --> 05:08:49.300
Yes, I've linked the ac short if you want to watch that literally it's in the the the chat

05:08:49.860 --> 05:08:54.420
A right now at the top. It's a funny clip. I was absolutely hilarious

05:08:54.900 --> 05:09:00.340
It might actually be the first a clip on the viewer like clip channel. Um

05:09:01.380 --> 05:09:05.540
We're gonna very slowly start putting stuff up. Um

05:09:09.060 --> 05:09:14.180
Sorry, I just opened up Marshmallow just to see if anyone said anything the first sentence I read

05:09:14.500 --> 05:09:18.100
One of the reasons I love you so much is that you can't spell or read

05:09:20.260 --> 05:09:26.820
Refling oh my god, you're not supposed to say that. I mean you can Amy has a new one with her rats

05:09:27.700 --> 05:09:32.580
Oh, did she post it? Okay. Uh, I will link. Uh, I'm actually gonna link Emmys

05:09:33.620 --> 05:09:39.540
Tomorrow's stream. I will pin Emmys. I've pinned acs today. I'll pin Emmys main. I'm not really that bothered about

05:09:42.500 --> 05:09:45.140
Wait hypnosis about pineapple on pizza. I missed that

05:09:46.100 --> 05:09:50.020
Um, when we were meme I was memeing with the reeflings like in another stream

05:09:50.500 --> 05:09:56.260
And I think I was like, oh that would be a really funny meme video like someone said it and I was like, oh my god

05:09:56.820 --> 05:10:03.060
What if I did it hypnotizes you to like pineapple on pizza ASMR because like obviously I like my meme and shitpost day one

05:10:04.740 --> 05:10:10.580
Um, or a little illiterate little seaweed doesn't know our abc's or one two three's honestly. Um

05:10:11.540 --> 05:10:17.860
What was the rest of that message though? I don't really know why but I can't stop myself from wanting to squeeze you tight in my embrace

05:10:17.860 --> 05:10:22.500
And kiss you on the forehead when you spell something wrong, especially when you get flustered over at a dory

05:10:22.500 --> 05:10:25.860
I always have. Oh, thank you reeflin. I'm glad it doesn't frustrate you

05:10:26.420 --> 05:10:31.220
I feel like when people like see how I type it's like, oh my god, how does your mind work like that?

05:10:31.620 --> 05:10:36.820
but like I don't I like trying not be mean to myself about it because

05:10:37.860 --> 05:10:39.860
like I

05:10:40.180 --> 05:10:47.940
I think it's like a good thing that I show like, oh, I don't know how to spell so I have to spell it phonetically in my head like I have to

05:10:49.300 --> 05:10:54.260
Do things in my head like a bit different the way that like you might have been taught or you do otherwise

05:10:54.820 --> 05:10:56.340
um

05:10:56.340 --> 05:11:01.460
So yeah, I'm glad it doesn't frustrate you and you have the patience for how dumb dumb I am

05:11:02.980 --> 05:11:08.100
More making hypnotizes for all four and all she likes but pineapple pizza is too far

05:11:08.180 --> 05:11:13.220
Okay, dude. You're done. So what's the plan of attack tomorrow?

05:11:14.580 --> 05:11:16.580
um

05:11:18.100 --> 05:11:20.100

05:11:38.340 --> 05:11:41.620

Um, and then I'm doing a membership ASMR. So yes, hopefully

05:11:46.660 --> 05:11:49.940

And the members we love everything you do. Oh, thank you. I love everything you do too

05:11:58.500 --> 05:12:00.740

05:12:39.300 --> 05:12:40.820

And not a crossbow ball from halfway across the map whilst I munch on my food and commentate if the reeflings are doing well

05:14:31.220 --> 05:14:32.900
in the fight or not

05:14:32.900 --> 05:14:34.900
