1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:29,920
I'm here, I'm here, I'm here, I'm here.

2
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:31,920
Do you see me?

3
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:33,920
I'm all up.

4
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:34,920
Hi?

5
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:35,920
Question mark?

6
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:37,920
Good morning, good evening, good afternoon yet?

7
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:38,920
Hi?

8
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:39,920
Hi?

9
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:40,920
Yes?

10
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:41,920
Yes?

11
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:42,920
Okay.

12
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:43,920
Okay.

13
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:44,920
I'll take that as it is.

14
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:45,920
Good morning, good evening, good afternoon.

15
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:46,920
Thank you for waiting.

16
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:47,920
We are doing our meet-in.

17
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:48,920
Oh my God.

18
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:49,920
Veiler meet-in.

19
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:50,920
Oh my God.

20
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:51,920
Exclusive insider information.

21
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:52,920
What have they got planned?

22
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:53,920
You'll never know.

23
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:54,920
You'll never know.

24
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:55,920
You're not going to know.

25
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:56,920
You won't know until it's ready.

26
00:00:56,920 --> 00:00:57,920
That's right.

27
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:02,920
Keep your secrets, keep your secrets.

28
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:04,920
I'm playing Legal Lord of the Rings.

29
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:09,920
It is a full-screen game, so everything might go black momentarily until we can get in game.

30
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:13,920
I'm going to pray that the volume settings are right, but you must tell me if they're

31
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:15,920
not, I will change them in game.

32
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:18,920
Did I sleep well?

33
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:20,920
Did I fuck?

34
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:23,920
Look at it.

35
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:26,920
Legal Lord of the Rings.

36
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:28,920
Would we believe it if we didn't?

37
00:01:35,420 --> 00:01:42,740
Load game, new game. Oh my god. Oh, no. Oh, no, you can see that I tested it for a millisecond, okay?

38
00:01:43,060 --> 00:01:47,200
We're just gonna jump right into... right into the...

39
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:52,380
I just love the image of reflins in a room all getting sick and all you hear is

40
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:56,980
Stronny in the other room shouting a muffled don't go up. The kettle is bubbly.

41
00:01:56,980 --> 00:02:00,000
That's literally what it was, like I set up the chat and all that.

42
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,460
I'm like the Kales boiling, the Kales boiling, fucking steady on, thank you sleepy fennex.

43
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:08,780
Literally, you perv thing, but we're back in the shire!

44
00:02:10,140 --> 00:02:15,800
All right, we're gonna get to it. Today's objective. We're gonna play Mission. We're gonna play Mission.

45
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:18,260
Um...

46
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:22,120
Now if I'm too big and you need me to be a wee bit smaller in the corner,

47
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:24,480
let me know because I'm fullscreen and I can't just do it.

48
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:27,920
Does the volume need up?

49
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:42,040
You love Lord of the Rings. I love Lord of the Rings. Maybe we should make out or something.

50
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:48,760
Maybe you should tell me about the lore of Tom Bombadil because I haven't read the books, but I know about them.

51
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:57,400
Maybe how you should tell me how Saruman's ring technically could be a

52
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:00,360
technical ring because it fits to any size.

53
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:11,120
There was a secret ring!

54
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:19,640
That Mount Doom, the Dark Lord Sauron, forged in secret a master ring to show you all others.

55
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:24,240
One ring to rule them all.

56
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:26,240
And one ring to bane them!

57
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:29,560
But there were some who resisted.

58
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:35,640
The Sildur! Men and Elves marched it into the fire!

59
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:41,040
And on the slopes of Mount Doom, they fought for the freedom and the secret volume.

60
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:45,280
The only thing you know is about Gollum. That's good enough for me.

61
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:59,640
Now, so the way I play Lego games,

62
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:08,440
the way I play Lego games is I blast through the missions and then I come back basically.

63
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:12,240
And we'll come back when we have all characters unlocked.

64
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:17,840
So I don't particularly go for the unlocks during the campaign mode, if that's okay with you.

65
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:20,560
So today's objective, we'll go through the missions.

66
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:23,040
I don't know how long it's gonna take me to get through the missions,

67
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:28,960
but it's just a small little game about, you know, one of the greatest movies of all time.

68
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:36,920
What, they've passed out?

69
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:43,440
It's Brian too quiet, did I forget to turn them off?

70
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:51,440
Thank you, Reverse, for saving the other replays as they vomited.

71
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:55,440
But they're doing better now.

72
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:59,440
Yeah, best way to do pick collectibles.

73
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:03,440
Yeah, I don't go for collectibles first because it annoys me, like that I can't get them right away.

74
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:08,440
Um, but I'll try my best.

75
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:12,440
The game's a bit too loud, hold on, options.

76
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:19,440
Six, a little bit.

77
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:21,440
Oh, nope, that didn't work.

78
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:23,440
Okay, I'll put it down to six.

79
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:25,440
You tell me what you like about number six, okay?

80
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:28,440
Because how many times are you gonna clap me for jet?

81
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:36,440
Oh, sorry, we need to get this.

82
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:38,440
Oh my god.

83
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:40,440
Wait, why is the button broken?

84
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:44,440
Oh my god, the buttons broke on my freaking mouse.

85
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:46,440
Not my mouse, on my...

86
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:48,440
Wait, it's actually not working.

87
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:50,440
I'm pressing Y, Danny, hold it.

88
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:52,440
Oh, I need to hold it.

89
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:55,440
Look, I'm pressing Y.

90
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:57,440
I'm pressing Y.

91
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:59,440
I'm pressing Y.

92
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:01,440
I'm pressing Y.

93
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:04,440
Look, I was just spanking that thing, okay?

94
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:06,440
I was spanking that thing, okay?

95
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:10,440
It's actually beating the crap out of that button.

96
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:13,440
Okay, it was hold.

97
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:16,440
When they do the tutorial bit, you have to hold.

98
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:18,440
Six rules to clap them all.

99
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:20,440
Real, I'm true.

100
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:22,440
A moment.

101
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:24,440
I'm special, okay?

102
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:27,440
Yes, for those of you who are here,

103
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:30,440
there is a membership stream, I believe.

104
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:31,440
That's not a mistake.

105
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:33,440
Oh, sorry, sorry, Elra, I didn't mean it, mate.

106
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:35,440
That was a mistake.

107
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:39,440
Ah, I do have a copache,

108
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:42,440
because I was calling the way, not meeting.

109
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:44,440
I was just spanking that thing.

110
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:46,440
Average.

111
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:48,440
Ah, enemy.

112
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:52,440
I got an enemy, enemy.

113
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:55,440
I'm really going for it today.

114
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:59,440
This is one of my top 10 games of all time, okay?

115
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:02,440
Top 10 games of all time.

116
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:04,440
So these statues here just say,

117
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:08,440
Save stations, gotta love my safe stations.

118
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:11,440
I heard Winnell tell, right,

119
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:13,440
we need the guy with the sword, okay?

120
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:16,440
So back left is called Mithril,

121
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:18,440
but we can't do anything with it

122
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:20,440
until we unlock a certain enemy.

123
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:23,440
His name is Berserker, actually.

124
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:24,440
Oh, God.

125
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:26,440
Oh, God, I completely balls that up.

126
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:28,440
Sorry, I don't know when he does.

127
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:30,440
Oh, God, he is really big.

128
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:32,440
I'm getting nervous.

129
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:34,440
I'm getting nervous, okay?

130
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:36,440
I'm getting nervous. I'm getting sweaty.

131
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:39,440
Right, do your owl, right on my forehead.

132
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:41,440
So he'll get his thing stuck,

133
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:43,440
and it's the classic, gotta do it three times,

134
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:45,440
which means it's the best game.

135
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:48,440
Legosarons, but I think he's actually supposed to be,

136
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:50,440
like, a huge mongoswap.

137
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:54,440
Ah, run away.

138
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:56,440
But yeah, once his thing gets stuck,

139
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:58,440
he'll basically tallywack him,

140
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:01,440
and then we make it up to Mentum,

141
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:03,440
but we need to get close enough

142
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:05,440
to let the AI actually slam down,

143
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:08,440
or he will, like, infinitely just go for it, really.

144
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:10,440
It's a bit of a out.

145
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:12,440
Yeah, that, that, yeah, that.

146
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:14,440
Don't do that. That's really rude.

147
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:16,440
But we need to convince him to slam his wee thing down

148
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:18,440
so it gets stuck.

149
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:20,440
Basically. Can you do it now?

150
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:22,440
Get stuck.

151
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:24,440
Get stuck, get stuck. Plop, plop, plop.

152
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:27,440
What are you doing, Stepsauron?

153
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:29,440
Okay, this one? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

154
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:31,440
No, no, no, no, don't get distracted now.

155
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:33,440
Wow, wow, wow, wow. There we go.

156
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:35,440
He's on one health now.

157
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:37,440
You can see his little health bar in the middle,

158
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:39,440
but this is best game all time,

159
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:41,440
like, top 10 game unironically.

160
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:44,440
I have to say, Assassin's Creed Brotherhood has to be number one.

161
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:46,440
Would this be number two?

162
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:49,440
I mean, she...

163
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:51,440
I think this is a number two for me.

164
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:53,440
It might be. It might be.

165
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:55,440
This is top three games,

166
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:56,440
so I can judge them.

167
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:58,440
Stepsauron, dear god.

168
00:08:58,440 --> 00:08:59,440
Portal 2?

169
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:01,440
Speaking of Portal 2,

170
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:04,440
guess which Vialura Girl hasn't played Portal 2?

171
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:07,440
And I get to play with her for the first time.

172
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:09,440
Ah, wee, my face.

173
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:11,440
Stop it, you hurt my face.

174
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:13,440
This game was my childhood.

175
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:14,440
Wow.

176
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:16,440
This is gonna be an amazing time.

177
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:18,440
This game was my childhood. It's gonna be amazing.

178
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:20,440
Oh, it's such a good game, isn't it?

179
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:23,440
Hello, World of War and Old Warframe.

180
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:24,440
You nerd.

181
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:26,440
Oh, he's gonna get me.

182
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:30,440
So the enemies constantly respawn health for you,

183
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:32,440
but we should be done.

184
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:34,440
Okay, there we go.

185
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:36,440
We got him. Go done, you stinky man.

186
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:38,440
My eyes are stinky.

187
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:40,440
Nice.

188
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:42,440
Skyrim, Diablo, Cyberpunk.

189
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:44,440
I've still yet to play Cyberpunk.

190
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:46,440
I'd like to play it for the first time with you.

191
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:54,440
He lost his tentacle.

192
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:57,440
That's what you get, you stinky evil man.

193
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:01,440
Oh, he's Regen.

194
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:02,440
Oh.

195
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:04,440
You could probably sell his armor

196
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:06,440
for some steel and gold and stuff.

197
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:10,440
Skyrim, Fire, Amblin, Nier.

198
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:12,440
I've still not played that one.

199
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:14,440
Sonic Generation.

200
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:15,440
Darkest Dungeon.

201
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:17,440
If you can carry me through Darkest Dungeon,

202
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:19,440
I will be very happy to play it,

203
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:21,440
but I've never been able to win at it.

204
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:24,440
I've attempted it twice and I've not won.

205
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:27,440
Maybe it's one of those things where I need to play offline.

206
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:31,440
There's more enemies.

207
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:32,440
But yeah.

208
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:34,440
I'm not going to try...

209
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:36,440
Oh, elves have a higher jump than humans

210
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:38,440
in the game, just so you know.

211
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:40,440
I am going to try...

212
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:43,440
And of course, he has the sword that I need to progress,

213
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:45,440
so I need to come back with him.

214
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:47,440
I'm gonna try and what?

215
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:49,440
I don't know, good luck.

216
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:51,440
I've already forgotten my point,

217
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:53,440
so you guys just have to finish it for me.

218
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:00,440
I'm gonna try and play some games for the first time.

219
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:02,440
Someone recommended me playing Yu-Gi-Oh!

220
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:05,440
And Poseidon has been playing...

221
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:09,440
Poseidon's been playing card games,

222
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:11,440
like Pokemon card, like TCG stuff,

223
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:14,440
and I'm like, honestly, I wouldn't mind giving Yu-Gi-Oh! a bash,

224
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:15,440
just for the hell of it.

225
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:17,440
I want ice summon Pot of Greed!

226
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:19,440
Pot of Greed! Pot of Greed!

227
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:21,440
I just wanted to keep going, basically.

228
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:23,440
Yu-Gi-Oh is so fun.

229
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:25,440
I mean, I just may, you know.

230
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:29,440
Now, I would try and go for a full money as well,

231
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:33,440
but again, I don't really want...

232
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:36,440
We can do it so easily as soon as we unlock

233
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:38,440
the times 2 stud multiplier.

234
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:41,440
It's just not even an issue at this point in time.

235
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:46,440
I am going to not look up any tutorials

236
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:48,440
where any items are, any things are.

237
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:53,440
I have played this game maybe 12 times now.

238
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:56,440
I'm sure my subconscious will secretly know

239
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:58,440
what I need to do.

240
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:01,440
There's stuff up there, yeah, all that jazz.

241
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:03,440
Lit me in!

242
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:06,440
There is a funny achievement here

243
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:08,440
that you're not ready for.

244
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:11,440
If you drop yourself into the fire below,

245
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:13,440
you get an achievement and a hidden achievement

246
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:14,440
is the good thing.

247
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:16,440
Oh no, I don't think I'm playing this on Xbox.

248
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:19,440
I'm doing this on Steam because I already had it on Steam.

249
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:21,440
I don't want to feel...

250
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:23,440
Oh my god, we're just going to have to replay it again.

251
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:25,440
Oh, you don't have to tell me twice

252
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:28,440
that I get to replay it on Xbox for all the achievements.

253
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:30,440
You don't have to tell me twice.

254
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:32,440
I'm already doing it.

255
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:33,440
I'm already doing it.

256
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:35,440
I tried Yu-Gi-Oh online, got blasted by the broken decks.

257
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:38,440
I have no idea what the stuff went on at Yu-Gi-Oh.

258
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:41,440
But we should get an achievement for jumping off the map here.

259
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:46,440
Achievement, it won't be that easy.

260
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:48,440
I know I'm covering up the achievement, but yeah.

261
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:50,440
Literally, it's a funny secret achievement.

262
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:51,440
I love it, I do it.

263
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:55,440
I think I can get 100% in this game

264
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:58,440
achievement-wise if I remember them all.

265
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:01,440
There's tools to reset achievement.

266
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:03,440
Destroy it!

267
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:05,440
No!

268
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:07,440
What are you doing?

269
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:09,440
Hesildur!

270
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:16,440
Is Legolord of the Rings how you suggest women?

271
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:18,440
This one anyway.

272
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:23,440
I have been muscle memory from the past.

273
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:24,440
Take over and get your victory.

274
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:26,440
The strength of men failed, no.

275
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:30,440
But the strength of my reflings will persevere.

276
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:33,440
They have the funniest cutscenes.

277
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:34,440
I'm so sorry.

278
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:36,440
There's a really funny one coming out.

279
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:45,440
Gollum's theme is so weird.

280
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:48,440
Well, it might not be Gollum's theme, but the Rings theme.

281
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:04,440
His name wasn't Gollum at the start.

282
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:06,440
He got corrupted into Gollum by the Rings.

283
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:12,440
Why does Eldron kill him at the beginning?

284
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:15,440
I'm pretty sure they were battle friends and all that.

285
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:18,440
He got hit by arrows while being invisible.

286
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:20,440
Billboards!

287
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:25,440
A Hobbit.

288
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:28,440
Hello!

289
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:31,440
Hello!

290
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:37,440
Stravum?

291
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:39,440
Actually, Gollum will play right now.

292
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:45,440
Prologue complete!

293
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:46,440
We already made it.

294
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:48,440
Look at all the progress we already made.

295
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:49,440
Boom!

296
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:51,440
Hesildur!

297
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:55,440
Characters available to buy.

298
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:56,440
Look at all that progress.

299
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:58,440
Are you not getting serotonin?

300
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:00,440
Looking at all these things progressing?

301
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:01,440
I mean, good day!

302
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:04,440
What kind of games do you play if you're not enjoying this?

303
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:05,440
None more hate.

304
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:06,440
You ain't taking my ring.

305
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:07,440
Give it here.

306
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:12,440
There is one map in particular

307
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:14,440
where we're going to have to turn the in-game sound down,

308
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:16,440
and it's the Swamp's map

309
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:18,440
because there's a Banshee in it

310
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:20,440
that screams through the entire level.

311
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:21,440
Lovely.

312
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:23,440
Gollum has more wind right now.

313
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:27,440
It's...

314
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:34,440
Oh my god!

315
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:35,440
It's our house!

316
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:47,440
Yes, yes, yes.

317
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:54,440
He's all old.

318
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:59,440
I'm chugging.

319
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:01,440
I'm chugging the tea.

320
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:06,440
Bring me one.

321
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:09,440
Ring.

322
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:17,440
Drop it.

323
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:18,440
Did you know?

324
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:20,440
In order to do the heavy ring effect,

325
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:22,440
they had a magnet under the floor

326
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:23,440
so it didn't bounce.

327
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:26,440
Just thought you should know that.

328
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:28,440
Just thought it was a cool detail

329
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:30,440
in order to show how the ring

330
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:31,440
isn't just a normal ring.

331
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:33,440
It doesn't bounce when it lands.

332
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:35,440
I just thought you should know that.

333
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:39,440
You knew that one.

334
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:40,440
Yeah.

335
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:43,440
Look at their chickens!

336
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:44,440
And our little...

337
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:46,440
Frodo!

338
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:47,440
Frodo!

339
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:48,440
Gandalf?

340
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:52,440
He's gone, hasn't he?

341
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:54,440
Stronys is just as you were

342
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:55,440
lured to the ring trivia.

343
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:56,440
Oh, stop.

344
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:57,440
I'll make that right now.

345
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:58,440
Are we getting...

346
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:00,440
Okay, I'm already by the end of it.

347
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:02,440
Did you know

348
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:04,440
that Aragorn was broken still?

349
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:05,440
Nobody ever...

350
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:08,440
I love the cutscenes.

351
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:10,440
I love the cutscenes in this game!

352
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:12,440
I'm going to put subtitles on

353
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:13,440
after this, okay?

354
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:16,440
That moves the arm.

355
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:17,440
That's literally me

356
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:18,440
when I'd be like fucking about it.

357
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:19,440
If I had the ring,

358
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:20,440
I'd be losing it over

359
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:21,440
where I'd be like,

360
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:22,440
shit.

361
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:23,440
I lost it.

362
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:24,440
What do you mean you lost it?

363
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:34,440
I ain't dropping no eaves!

364
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:41,440
I ain't been dropping no eaves

365
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:42,440
so honest.

366
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:46,440
What's that doing?

367
00:17:58,440 --> 00:17:59,440
Oh my god,

368
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:01,440
if they ever release a LEGO

369
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:02,440
like Hobbiton...

370
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:03,440
Keep it safe.

371
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:04,440
Keep it safe.

372
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:05,440
Keep it safe.

373
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:06,440
Um...

374
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:07,440
LEGO set,

375
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:09,440
I don't care what the price is,

376
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:10,440
we're going to do Handcam

377
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:12,440
building it from start to finish.

378
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:13,440
I don't care if my butt's in the shot,

379
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:14,440
I don't care if my feet's in the shot,

380
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:16,440
I don't care if my wig is in the shot,

381
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:18,440
we are building that motherfucking bang!

382
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:19,440
I'll...

383
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:20,440
I wish...

384
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:21,440
I wish they would come out with it

385
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:22,440
because they came out with

386
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:23,440
a fucking black gate,

387
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:25,440
like who requested the black gate?

388
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:26,440
What fanny requested LEGO

389
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:27,440
come out with a black gate?

390
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:29,440
Who is not submitting

391
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:30,440
for Bag End?

392
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:31,440
Who is not submitting

393
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:32,440
for Hobbiton?

394
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:34,440
Who is not submitting?

395
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:35,440
Now,

396
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:36,440
as I said,

397
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:38,440
I just steamroll the campaign

398
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:39,440
so I can unlock everything

399
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:41,440
in order to fly between

400
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:42,440
locations.

401
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:43,440
You need to activate the

402
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:44,440
travel stone.

403
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:45,440
So we've just activated

404
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:47,440
the one in Hobbiton.

405
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:48,440
As you can see,

406
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:49,440
we can have flight to that

407
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:50,440
location at any time

408
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:51,440
or fast travel,

409
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:52,440
but wait,

410
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:53,440
we do it on an eagle

411
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:54,440
if I'm not mistaken.

412
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:56,440
If you follow the ghost studs,

413
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:58,440
it will take you to the next mission.

414
00:18:58,440 --> 00:18:59,440
As I said,

415
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:00,440
I ignore everything

416
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:01,440
and just go straight

417
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:02,440
for the campaign.

418
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:04,440
I'm not actually sure how

419
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:06,440
long the stream is going to be

420
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:07,440
or if I'm going to be tempted

421
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:09,440
to stream a little bit more,

422
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:10,440
but we're going to go straight

423
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:12,440
to Farmer Maggot's field.

424
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:16,440
There we go.

425
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:17,440
Let's go.

426
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:19,440
Momy is so active.

427
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:20,440
Wonderful.

428
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:22,440
We've got to love Eagle Uber.

429
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:23,440
There's a Shire game release

430
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:24,440
and so,

431
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:25,440
yes,

432
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:26,440
unfortunately,

433
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:27,440
the graphics.

434
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:28,440
So,

435
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:29,440
Weta Workshop,

436
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:30,440
I believe,

437
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:31,440
actually worked with the game studio,

438
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:32,440
which is good news

439
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:33,440
because lore-wise,

440
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:34,440
we love it.

441
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:35,440
Oh, no,

442
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:36,440
was it Weta?

443
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:38,440
Ah,

444
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:39,440
man,

445
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:40,440
Pippin!

446
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:42,440
Ah,

447
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:43,440
he's getting...

448
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:44,440
Oh, no,

449
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:45,440
we're in trouble by Farmer Maggot.

450
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:50,440
Sam said,

451
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:51,440
oh,

452
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:52,440
you're really roping me

453
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:53,440
into this one.

454
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:55,440
More than the graphics

455
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:56,440
is the animal.

456
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:57,440
Yeah.

457
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:00,440
This game is cute.

458
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:01,440
It's so cute.

459
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:03,440
But we're about to do

460
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:04,440
the first scary mission.

461
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:06,440
I think I've broken something.

462
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:08,440
Huh?

463
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:12,440
Wait,

464
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:13,440
he's the guy that says

465
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:14,440
I'm going on an adventure.

466
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:16,440
If I take another step,

467
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:17,440
this will be the furthest

468
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:18,440
I've ever gone from home

469
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:19,440
or something like that.

470
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:20,440
Close enough.

471
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:21,440
There is a

472
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:22,440
Legate Hobble set.

473
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:23,440
Oh, sorry.

474
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:25,440
Stop!

475
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:26,440
Is there a Lego Hobbit set

476
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:27,440
called the Hobbit

477
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:28,440
on Unexpected Gats?

478
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:29,440
Shut up.

479
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:32,440
I don't have my phone right now,

480
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:33,440
and I don't want to tab out

481
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:34,440
because it might break the game.

482
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:36,440
Is he telling the truth

483
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:37,440
or is he telling porkies

484
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:38,440
right now?

485
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:39,440
Please.

486
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:40,440
Thank you, Stephen,

487
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:41,440
Boknik

488
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:42,440
for the super chat as well.

489
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:43,440
I just realized

490
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:44,440
I completely forgot to say your name.

491
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:46,440
Thank you for your patience

492
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:47,440
if you're still lurking

493
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:48,440
in the shadows.

494
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:49,440
I literally read it

495
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:50,440
and then never said your name.

496
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:51,440
Sorry!

497
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:52,440
Unless,

498
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:53,440
oh no,

499
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:54,440
it's one of those names

500
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:55,440
where you can have multiple pronunciations.

501
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:56,440
Stephen,

502
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:57,440
Stephen,

503
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:58,440
Stefano,

504
00:20:58,440 --> 00:20:59,440
I don't know,

505
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:00,440
close enough.

506
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:01,440
They all look good enough to me.

507
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:03,440
Right.

508
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:04,440
It has a speed.

509
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:06,440
Sam actually comes in pretty clutch

510
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:07,440
in the gameplay.

511
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:09,440
It's real.

512
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:10,440
It's super expensive.

513
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:11,440
How big is it?

514
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:12,440
Or is that a wee thing

515
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:13,440
or a big thing?

516
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:14,440
Because I was actually going to do

517
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:15,440
a Lego building hand cam.

518
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:16,440
Sorry.

519
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:17,440
It inspired me.

520
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:18,440
And I have like this

521
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:19,440
wee baby Star Wars one.

522
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:20,440
It's like a wee tiny thing.

523
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:21,440
It would just be a cute wee thing.

524
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:22,440
It's real.

525
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:23,440
It's just the Hobbit hole though.

526
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:26,440
What?

527
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:27,440
Like it's not back end

528
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:28,440
or anything.

529
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:30,440
Wait, hold on.

530
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:31,440
I'm grabbing this.

531
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:32,440
I might as well grab it.

532
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:33,440
Oh, no, I won't.

533
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:34,440
I guess I'll grab it

534
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:35,440
from the other side.

535
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:37,440
Silly.

536
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:39,440
Okay, we are going to whack

537
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:40,440
this tree open.

538
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:41,440
It's easy money inside.

539
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:42,440
And right now,

540
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:43,440
let's go, let's go.

541
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:45,440
Oh, one of them got caught.

542
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:46,440
I just heard him go,

543
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:47,440
ah!

544
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:49,440
Have you played The Witcher 3?

545
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:50,440
I have not.

546
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:51,440
It's one of the games

547
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:52,440
that I want to play with you

548
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:53,440
for the first time.

549
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:54,440
I've kind of planned out

550
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:55,440
what I'm doing next month.

551
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:57,440
We are wrapping up Elden Ring.

552
00:21:58,440 --> 00:21:59,440
I've got three days in a row

553
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:01,440
to wrap up Elden Ring.

554
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:03,440
Like three, 12-hour back-to-back

555
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:05,440
in one week.

556
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:08,440
So I do need stream snipers.

557
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:09,440
You know, stream,

558
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:11,440
don't be afraid to stream snip me.

559
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:13,440
Now, as much as I want to

560
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:15,440
teleport to another character

561
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:16,440
and go down,

562
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:18,440
Sam will be stuck up there

563
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:19,440
if you do that.

564
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:21,440
Early thoughts on Geryl.

565
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:22,440
I watched, like,

566
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:23,440
15 minutes at episode one

567
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:25,440
and I just felt

568
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:26,440
I couldn't finish it.

569
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:27,440
I'm sorry.

570
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:28,440
I suck.

571
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:29,440
Okay, I suck.

572
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:30,440
Witcher 3 might take

573
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:31,440
three days to, like, a hundred percent.

574
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:32,440
Dark Souls 3, obviously.

575
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:34,440
I have to pick something to go with.

576
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:38,440
Um, but yeah.

577
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:40,440
Okay, let's go ahead.

578
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:53,440
Breaking Bad Watch Along?

579
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:55,440
I actually have Anime Watch Along.

580
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:57,440
You're not ready for it.

581
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:58,440
I'm going to start a series

582
00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:00,440
called Make Me a Weeb,

583
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:02,440
and we watched 12-shot,

584
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:03,440
12-episode Animes

585
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:05,440
together.

586
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:06,440
So...

587
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:07,440
I don't know.

588
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:08,440
It might go well.

589
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:10,440
We're going to test it with...

590
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:12,440
I'll start with two

591
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:15,440
Animes.

592
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:16,440
I've picked them

593
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:17,440
and I've already forgotten one.

594
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:19,440
Wait, one of yous might like it.

595
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:21,440
Okay, one of yous might like it.

596
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:22,440
It's called...

597
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:24,440
Shit, I've forgotten.

598
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:25,440
It's about two girls.

599
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:27,440
One of them doesn't have a mum.

600
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:28,440
They're in high school,

601
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:30,440
and it's called Sugar Something,

602
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:32,440
but they kill or something.

603
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:33,440
I read the synapses

604
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:34,440
and I was like, fuck yeah,

605
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:36,440
that's got Mercy written all over it.

606
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:37,440
I wouldn't watch Animes

607
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:39,440
that inspire me about the girls.

608
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:40,440
So I picked the first one

609
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:41,440
to be, like, this one called

610
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:42,440
Sugar Something.

611
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:47,440
You're already a weeb.

612
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:49,440
Oh, I'm definitely a gamer over a weeb.

613
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:50,440
So that's why I wanted to start

614
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:52,440
a fun series called, like,

615
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:54,440
Oh, Turn Me into a Weeb.

616
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:56,440
Happy Sugar Life!

617
00:23:56,440 --> 00:23:58,440
Yes, you know it!

618
00:23:58,440 --> 00:23:59,440
You're so smart.

619
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:00,440
What the heck?

620
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:01,440
It's, yeah.

621
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:03,440
I literally typed in, like,

622
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:05,440
oh, um,

623
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:06,440
12 episode Animes

624
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:08,440
that are highly recommended,

625
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:09,440
and that came up

626
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:11,440
and I was like, ooh, okay.

627
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:13,440
So we're going to give it a shot.

628
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:14,440
See if we like it.

629
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:16,440
It will be a public watch-along stream.

630
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:17,440
Like, it's not going to be

631
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:18,440
a membership stream,

632
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:19,440
so please don't worry.

633
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:21,440
Right, see that lock back there?

634
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:22,440
Fucking slam them into it.

635
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:24,440
There, you should get that item.

636
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:28,440
Um, this is one of the most

637
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:30,440
hidden, annoying treasure boxes.

638
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:32,440
Unless you know it's there,

639
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:33,440
you ain't going to figure out

640
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:34,440
what you're supposed to do.

641
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:36,440
Um, so we need to get them

642
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:37,440
to walk away now.

643
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:38,440
He'll jump to the right

644
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:39,440
because we're getting too close

645
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:40,440
to him on this side.

646
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:43,440
Oh, well, that wasn't quite what we can.

647
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:46,440
I do want to stay close to-

648
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:48,440
Look, I'm swinging them here.

649
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:53,440
I need them, yeah, there we go.

650
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:54,440
I need them to jump away.

651
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:56,440
There we go.

652
00:24:56,440 --> 00:24:57,440
And then, you picked up

653
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:59,440
the most awkward one of this map.

654
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:00,440
I kid you not.

655
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:05,440
Have you heard of cyberpunk edge runners?

656
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:06,440
I have, sadly.

657
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:08,440
It destroyed me.

658
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:11,440
He does take HP damage

659
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:12,440
when you walk on that map.

660
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:17,440
You know so much about this game.

661
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:18,440
Very impressive.

662
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:20,440
I love it!

663
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:22,440
And I hope maybe I can inspire you

664
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:23,440
to play it too.

665
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:24,440
If you think it's up your alley.

666
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:26,440
But if it's not up your alley,

667
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:27,440
please don't worry.

668
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:28,440
I know I don't really play

669
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:30,440
the games, maybe the majority.

670
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:31,440
I was actually thinking

671
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:32,440
about playing PAL World

672
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:34,440
because I remember it blew up

673
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:35,440
and I'm like,

674
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:36,440
you can literally walk away

675
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:37,440
from his fireballs.

676
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:38,440
They're not that bad.

677
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:47,440
But yeah,

678
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:48,440
if you ever wanted

679
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:49,440
games that I recommend

680
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:50,440
and you think we have

681
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:51,440
the same tapes,

682
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:53,440
then this game,

683
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:55,440
pull us out.

684
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:56,440
If this game

685
00:25:56,440 --> 00:25:57,440
not pull us for you,

686
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:58,440
that's okay.

687
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:00,440
That's okay.

688
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:03,440
And then we did it.

689
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:05,440
We already did the cutscene.

690
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:09,440
The music goes hard.

691
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:14,440
I played this game to death.

692
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:17,440
I won a cosplay as Rebecca

693
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:18,440
from Edge.

694
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:20,440
I don't know,

695
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:21,440
Runner to Edge

696
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:22,440
or something,

697
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:23,440
whatever that anime's called.

698
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:24,440
I'm teasing.

699
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:25,440
And I wanted to do

700
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:27,440
a neck down ASMR stream

701
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:28,440
dressed up as her.

702
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:31,440
I thought it would be cute.

703
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:35,440
So,

704
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:36,440
we just need to

705
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:37,440
put this boulder.

706
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:38,440
We beat up.

707
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:39,440
They see how the rocks

708
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:40,440
are kind of going.

709
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:41,440
The game helps you.

710
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:42,440
Honestly, don't worry

711
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:43,440
if you've never played

712
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:44,440
a LEGO game before.

713
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:45,440
These games are kind of

714
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:46,440
like for a more casual

715
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:47,440
experience.

716
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:48,440
Nothing try hard.

717
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:49,440
And especially

718
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:51,440
if the LEGO game is something

719
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:52,440
that you're interested in,

720
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:53,440
i.e.

721
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:55,440
like Lord of the Rings for me,

722
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:56,440
you will adore

723
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:57,440
whatever the game is,

724
00:26:57,440 --> 00:26:58,440
you know?

725
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:02,440
I think the guy named

726
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:03,440
David

727
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:04,440
in Mexican.

728
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:05,440
What?

729
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:06,440
What does it mean?

730
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:07,440
If you cosplay Rebecca,

731
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:08,440
are we going to

732
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:09,440
gimbal stomp you?

733
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:10,440
No!

734
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:11,440
Don't remind me.

735
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:12,440
Okay, don't remind me.

736
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:13,440
Oh, that poor owl

737
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:14,440
just got walloped

738
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:15,440
on the side of the head

739
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:16,440
because of me.

740
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:17,440
Don't fucking remind me

741
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:18,440
what happened to her.

742
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:20,440
Wait.

743
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:21,440
Hold on.

744
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:22,440
Everyone, go

745
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:23,440
annoy the...

746
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:27,440
Short stacks in the fast

747
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:28,440
make me go hard!

748
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:29,440
I mean,

749
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:30,440
that's what AC is.

750
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:33,440
That's what AC is.

751
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:36,440
AC had her comeback stream

752
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:37,440
today and

753
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:39,440
she absolutely adored

754
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:40,440
that she was

755
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:41,440
gullowing

756
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:42,440
and happiness

757
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:43,440
when she came back.

758
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:47,440
Oh wait, I think it's Mary

759
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:48,440
that fishes.

760
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:49,440
I...

761
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:50,440
You know what?

762
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:51,440
You know what?

763
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:52,440
I knew it was Mary.

764
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:53,440
I knew it was Mary,

765
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:54,440
you motherfucker!

766
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:56,440
Okay, we're going

767
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:57,440
catch a fish

768
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:58,440
and we're going

769
00:27:58,440 --> 00:27:59,440
cook it

770
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:00,440
and we're going to

771
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:02,440
have something.

772
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:04,440
Are you excited for

773
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:05,440
the new dwarf game?

774
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:06,440
It's supposed to be

775
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:07,440
like Deep Rock Galactica

776
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:08,440
about dwarfs

777
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:09,440
and I'm going to go ham on it.

778
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:10,440
I'm going to go

779
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:11,440
green eggs and ham.

780
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:13,440
No, don't be up the bush.

781
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:14,440
Throw the crab.

782
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:18,440
Well, you better

783
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:19,440
get off the bridge.

784
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:21,440
Oh, he has to go around now.

785
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:24,440
Round the outside,

786
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:25,440
round the outside.

787
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:26,440
As I said,

788
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:27,440
Sam comes in clutch

789
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:28,440
in this game

790
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:29,440
like all the time

791
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:30,440
with his abilities.

792
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:31,440
There is stuff back there

793
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:32,440
but it is really

794
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:33,440
to like

795
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:34,440
miserable on that.

796
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:35,440
But what about another fish?

797
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:36,440
To catch a fish,

798
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:38,440
juicy sweet.

799
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:40,440
Basically.

800
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:42,440
Buck them up,

801
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:43,440
Mr. Go Nature,

802
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:44,440
go!

803
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:45,440
Beat them up.

804
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:47,440
Beat them up.

805
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:52,440
So now what we do

806
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:54,440
is we go like this

807
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:55,440
and we're going to shove them

808
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:56,440
to the next area

809
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:57,440
because I normally

810
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:58,440
forget this one

811
00:28:58,440 --> 00:28:59,440
so I'm going to do it now.

812
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:00,440
Well,

813
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:01,440
we've had one breakfast.

814
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:02,440
Yes.

815
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:03,440
What about second breakfast?

816
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:07,440
Oh my God,

817
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:08,440
imagine all the food

818
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:09,440
I have to feed you guys

819
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:10,440
on the farm.

820
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:11,440
I'll be out in that garden.

821
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:12,440
I'll be making

822
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:13,440
the best tomatoes ever.

823
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:14,440
I'm like,

824
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:15,440
no one's getting prostate cancer

825
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:16,440
in my farm.

826
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:17,440
Prostate cancer

827
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:18,440
scared of us.

828
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:19,440
It's not the other way around.

829
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:23,440
Another one now.

830
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:24,440
Hold on a minute.

831
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:25,440
Boom!

832
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:26,440
And then we've done the section

833
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:27,440
just like that.

834
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:28,440
You can literally

835
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:29,440
like go right up to him

836
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:30,440
at this point

837
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:31,440
because it'll do the cut scene.

838
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:32,440
Right.

839
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:33,440
If I remember correctly,

840
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:34,440
it's left-right-left.

841
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:36,440
And if I fuck it up,

842
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:37,440
it's okay,

843
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:38,440
we can come back.

844
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:39,440
But I think it's left-right-left.

845
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:41,440
You're going to understand

846
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:42,440
in a second.

847
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:45,440
So how many four-speeds

848
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:46,440
do you food than tomatoes

849
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:47,440
to keep your income prostate

850
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:48,440
healthy?

851
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:49,440
Is there one more one?

852
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:50,440
Yeah,

853
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:51,440
prostate cancer.

854
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:52,440
Take a look.

855
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:53,440
It's so sweet to do.

856
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:55,440
Legitimately increase

857
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:56,440
my tomato intake.

858
00:29:56,440 --> 00:29:57,440
It's so good.

859
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:58,440
Right.

860
00:29:58,440 --> 00:29:59,440
I'm going to do left.

861
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:01,440
And then

862
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:02,440
and before it's right,

863
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:04,440
I wouldn't be surprised

864
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:05,440
if it was right.

865
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:06,440
I'm getting nervous.

866
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:07,440
I'm starting to doubt myself now.

867
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:08,440
I'm starting to doubt myself

868
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:09,440
if it's right.

869
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:11,440
I'm getting nervous.

870
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:12,440
I'm getting shaky.

871
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:13,440
Okay.

872
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:14,440
Maybe right side.

873
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:16,440
Did anyone know

874
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:17,440
if it's right side?

875
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:19,440
What happens

876
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:20,440
if it was right side

877
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:21,440
and I've missed it?

878
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:23,440
I knew it was right side!

879
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:26,440
No!

880
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:27,440
Did you see it?

881
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:28,440
Reflint,

882
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:29,440
did you see it?

883
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:31,440
I messed up so badly.

884
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:33,440
It was the

885
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:34,440
freaking right side

886
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:35,440
all along.

887
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:37,440
I messed it up.

888
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:39,440
I messed it up.

889
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:40,440
I knew it.

890
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:41,440
It's left, I believe.

891
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:42,440
Right mods,

892
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:43,440
time amount for 10 seconds.

893
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:45,440
It was right.

894
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:47,440
I'm going to drop that

895
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:48,440
with the thing.

896
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:50,440
Did you see it?

897
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:51,440
Literally the

898
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:52,440
freaking treasure box.

899
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:53,440
But we are going to have

900
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:54,440
to replay it anyway.

901
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:55,440
So it's not a big deal.

902
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:56,440
We'll remember.

903
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:57,440
We'll remember.

904
00:30:58,440 --> 00:30:59,440
Does this game

905
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:00,440
require you to revisit

906
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:01,440
areas when you've unlocked

907
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:02,440
a character?

908
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:03,440
Yes.

909
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:04,440
So the reason I

910
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:05,440
steamroll

911
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:06,440
the mission...

912
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:07,440
Oh, you actually did

913
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:08,440
time amount!

914
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:09,440
The reason why

915
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:10,440
I personally

916
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:12,440
enjoy playing the Lego games

917
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:13,440
by steamrolling

918
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:14,440
the missions

919
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:15,440
is because

920
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:16,440
I then unlock

921
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:17,440
all the characters

922
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:18,440
and then I replay

923
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:19,440
the missions

924
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:20,440
fully able to get

925
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:21,440
everything that I need.

926
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:23,440
Yeah?

927
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:24,440
Yeah.

928
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:27,440
So we are

929
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:28,440
going to be doing

930
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:29,440
that method.

931
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:30,440
Mods,

932
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:31,440
take this ring.

933
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:33,440
As I said,

934
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:34,440
I'm not really going to

935
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:35,440
go for

936
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:36,440
anything.

937
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:37,440
I just do

938
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:38,440
campaign mod.

939
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:39,440
And then as long as

940
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:40,440
I have enough money

941
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:41,440
for Berserker,

942
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:43,440
who is

943
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:44,440
an enemy

944
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:45,440
that has

945
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:47,440
explosions, basically,

946
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:48,440
so he can

947
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:49,440
destroy the myth realm.

948
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:53,440
The banshee scream

949
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:54,440
if you fail

950
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:55,440
dramatically.

951
00:31:56,440 --> 00:31:57,440
Mods, take away

952
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:58,440
a second breakfast.

953
00:31:58,440 --> 00:31:59,440
Oh!

954
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:00,440
Can you even say that?

955
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:01,440
Can you even

956
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:02,440
say that?

957
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:03,440
That poor leafling.

958
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:04,440
What have you done

959
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:05,440
to him?

960
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:06,440
He's grating.

961
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:07,440
He already threw up

962
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:08,440
his breakfast earlier

963
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:09,440
because,

964
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:10,440
you know,

965
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:11,440
I was a little bit late,

966
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:12,440
okay?

967
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:13,440
The meeting went

968
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:14,440
a wee bit longer.

969
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:15,440
A wee bit longer than

970
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:16,440
I had to go.

971
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:17,440
But that's because

972
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:18,440
you know me,

973
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:19,440
Classic County Stop,

974
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:20,440
yeah.

975
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:27,440
So we are now

976
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:28,440
in Breed,

977
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:29,440
the village of Breed.

978
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:30,440
And it's so awesome here

979
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:31,440
and it's so cool.

980
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:32,440
And this is where

981
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:33,440
we're going to do the

982
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:34,440
ting.

983
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:35,440
So this is where

984
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:36,440
we unlock the...

985
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:40,440
So...

986
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:46,440
We are learning

987
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:47,440
now the missions

988
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:49,440
that you can have

989
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:50,440
in game

990
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:51,440
when you're not

991
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:52,440
like when you're not

992
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:53,440
in a mission,

993
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:54,440
you can go on little

994
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:55,440
quests for the people

995
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:56,440
around the

996
00:32:56,440 --> 00:32:57,440
Middle Earth.

997
00:32:57,440 --> 00:32:58,440
And it is the

998
00:32:58,440 --> 00:32:59,440
cutest,

999
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:00,440
sweetest,

1000
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:01,440
most adorable thing

1001
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:02,440
ever.

1002
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:03,440
And I love it.

1003
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:04,440
I love it.

1004
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:05,440
So that kind gentleman

1005
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:06,440
is just asked

1006
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:08,440
for a mythril thingy.

1007
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:09,440
So we come over here,

1008
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:10,440
we interact,

1009
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:11,440
we select the

1010
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:12,440
trowel

1011
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:13,440
that we want to make.

1012
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:14,440
And then the

1013
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:15,440
blacksmith

1014
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:16,440
is going to pick up

1015
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:17,440
the

1016
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:18,440
mythril.

1017
00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:19,440
He's going to

1018
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:20,440
put it

1019
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:21,440
in the air,

1020
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:22,440
which I've forgotten

1021
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:23,440
the name of,

1022
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:24,440
that blacksmith

1023
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:25,440
called a furnace.

1024
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:26,440
A furnace,

1025
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:27,440
okay.

1026
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:28,440
And then

1027
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:29,440
we're going to jump

1028
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:30,440
on the air windy thing

1029
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:31,440
that goes in a furnace.

1030
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:32,440
I've forgotten

1031
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:33,440
the name of that too.

1032
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:35,440
And it's so cute.

1033
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:39,440
I didn't know that

1034
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:40,440
I got sidequests.

1035
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:41,440
I'm used to Lego games

1036
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:42,440
being more platform.

1037
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:43,440
Yes,

1038
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:44,440
we are going to play

1039
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:45,440
Lego Lord of the Ring.

1040
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:46,440
We're playing it

1041
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:47,440
right now.

1042
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:48,440
We are going to play

1043
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:49,440
Lego

1044
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:50,440
Star Wars,

1045
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:51,440
the original

1046
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:52,440
trilogy.

1047
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:53,440
Not the newest one.

1048
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:54,440
I've actually

1049
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:55,440
not played the

1050
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:56,440
newest Star Wars one

1051
00:33:56,440 --> 00:33:57,440
properly.

1052
00:33:57,440 --> 00:33:58,440
I like

1053
00:33:58,440 --> 00:33:59,440
gave a few missions

1054
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:00,440
and I was like,

1055
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:01,440
apparently they scale

1056
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:02,440
the money

1057
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:03,440
and it was like,

1058
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:04,440
no, the whole

1059
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:07,440
the whole point

1060
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:08,440
the door

1061
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:09,440
literally will not open

1062
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:10,440
unless I

1063
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:11,440
hop out the troll.

1064
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:12,440
You mean the complete saga?

1065
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:13,440
Yeah.

1066
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:14,440
I don't know what I said,

1067
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:15,440
but I do mean the complete

1068
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:16,440
saga.

1069
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:17,440
Thank you for looking past

1070
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:18,440
my words and understanding

1071
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:19,440
what I was trying to say

1072
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:20,440
because

1073
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:21,440
I'm missing out.

1074
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:22,440
Thank you so much.

1075
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:23,440
What does a myth

1076
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:24,440
real troll do?

1077
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:25,440
It means any character

1078
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:26,440
can dig.

1079
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:28,440
So

1080
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:29,440
Frodo doesn't have

1081
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:30,440
the ability to dig.

1082
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:31,440
However,

1083
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:32,440
now he does

1084
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:33,440
with the myth

1085
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:34,440
real troll.

1086
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:35,440
It will always be

1087
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:36,440
on our persons now.

1088
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:37,440
So

1089
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:38,440
it's pretty cool.

1090
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:39,440
To me,

1091
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:40,440
I don't know.

1092
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:41,440
Pretty cool.

1093
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:42,440
So you can like unlock

1094
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:43,440
a fishing rod.

1095
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:44,440
You can unlock fireworks

1096
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:45,440
for explosives.

1097
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:46,440
It's really good

1098
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:47,440
and there's some goofy

1099
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:48,440
fun items too.

1100
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:51,440
It's just called

1101
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:52,440
a forge fan,

1102
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:53,440
honestly.

1103
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:54,440
Jackson Shaw.

1104
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:55,440
Hi, Momay.

1105
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:56,440
Hi, Evelyn.

1106
00:34:56,440 --> 00:34:57,440
I miss you.

1107
00:34:57,440 --> 00:34:58,440
I'm back already.

1108
00:34:58,440 --> 00:34:59,440
Back in the shell.

1109
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:01,440
We're back in the shadow.

1110
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:25,440
Literally us.

1111
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:26,440
Literally.

1112
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:27,440
I'm getting one.

1113
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:28,440
I have

1114
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:29,440
so

1115
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:30,440
getting one.

1116
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:34,440
He disappeared,

1117
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:35,440
but now they know.

1118
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:38,440
Frodo, no.

1119
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:42,440
I see.

1120
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:45,440
Me when you

1121
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:46,440
haven't inked

1122
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:47,440
in 24 hours.

1123
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:48,440
I see.

1124
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:52,440
I should have known

1125
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:53,440
what a troll does

1126
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:54,440
because I want to

1127
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:55,440
dig you down.

1128
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:56,440
Wait,

1129
00:35:56,440 --> 00:35:57,440
wait.

1130
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:00,440
Thank you.

1131
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:05,440
They're in the main bathroom.

1132
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:09,440
Giant room.

1133
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:10,440
They're going to sleep.

1134
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:11,440
Love you, Johnny.

1135
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:12,440
Love you, Taylor.

1136
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:14,440
Put that broom

1137
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:15,440
stick on that door.

1138
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:21,440
They were once men.

1139
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:28,440
Why are you taking us

1140
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:29,440
into the wild?

1141
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:31,440
Let's go.

1142
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:32,440
We're going to

1143
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:33,440
Weathertop.

1144
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:34,440
Run.

1145
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:35,440
We need to go to

1146
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:36,440
Weathertop before they

1147
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:37,440
get us.

1148
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:38,440
Run, run, run, run, run, run, run.

1149
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:41,440
So now it's raining

1150
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:42,440
because

1151
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:43,440
there's weather

1152
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:44,440
system in this game

1153
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:45,440
and it's really

1154
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:46,440
cool

1155
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:47,440
and I like it.

1156
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:48,440
So we're going to

1157
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:49,440
make our way to

1158
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:50,440
Weathertop.

1159
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:51,440
It's actually that thing

1160
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:52,440
right there.

1161
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:53,440
I thought it was a bit

1162
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:54,440
more to the right,

1163
00:36:54,440 --> 00:36:55,440
but it's not.

1164
00:36:56,440 --> 00:36:57,440
I'm going to use

1165
00:36:57,440 --> 00:36:58,440
my mithril tool

1166
00:36:58,440 --> 00:36:59,440
to fill you up.

1167
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:00,440
So

1168
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:01,440
wait until we make some

1169
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:02,440
more of the item.

1170
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:03,440
I wonder how tight the

1171
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:04,440
clutch is.

1172
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:05,440
We fucking play it.

1173
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:06,440
How are we supposed

1174
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:07,440
to keep up

1175
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:08,440
on no anchoring treatment?

1176
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:09,440
I don't know.

1177
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:10,440
Frodo, you cheated.

1178
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:11,440
You teleported.

1179
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:12,440
So we're going to

1180
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:13,440
unlock this travel stone.

1181
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:15,440
This will help us

1182
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:17,440
be super duper fast.

1183
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:22,440
Super duper fast.

1184
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:27,440
Yes.

1185
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:30,440
We go up there

1186
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:31,440
and stay here.

1187
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:34,440
And we

1188
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:35,440
get to it.

1189
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:44,440
And then we go up

1190
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:45,440
to Weathertop.

1191
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:48,440
This is exactly

1192
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:49,440
the level of

1193
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:50,440
Demon's Soul.

1194
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:51,440
Why does this look so cute?

1195
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:52,440
I don't even know

1196
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:53,440
when this game is produced,

1197
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:54,440
honestly.

1198
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:56,440
Okay.

1199
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:57,440
We all got swords now.

1200
00:37:57,440 --> 00:37:58,440
We're getting upgrades.

1201
00:37:58,440 --> 00:37:59,440
Upgrades, people.

1202
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:00,440
Upgrades.

1203
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:04,440
Dun dun dun.

1204
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:07,440
Put it out.

1205
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:08,440
Put the fire out.

1206
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:09,440
What do you think?

1207
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:11,440
He said it.

1208
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:15,440
He said the line.

1209
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:20,440
Okay.

1210
00:38:20,440 --> 00:38:21,440
So we're going to

1211
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:22,440
make some food

1212
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:23,440
at the mountain top,

1213
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:24,440
which is silly.

1214
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:25,440
We shouldn't

1215
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:26,440
because it's going to

1216
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:27,440
give our way of position.

1217
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:28,440
But look,

1218
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:29,440
we're just mischievous

1219
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:30,440
little hobbits.

1220
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:31,440
We're hungry.

1221
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:32,440
Okay.

1222
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:33,440
We didn't have

1223
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:34,440
11 Zs for once.

1224
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:36,440
We didn't have

1225
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:37,440
second breakfast for two.

1226
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:38,440
Damn right,

1227
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:39,440
we're hungry.

1228
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:41,440
Of course we're hungry.

1229
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:43,440
Shocking behavior.

1230
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:44,440
So now we've got

1231
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:45,440
a fish in the pan.

1232
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:46,440
Now we're going to

1233
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:47,440
put tomato in the pan

1234
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:48,440
because this is going

1235
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:49,440
to groove the tomato.

1236
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:51,440
We got

1237
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:53,440
Yeah.

1238
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:54,440
Frodo's asleep right now.

1239
00:38:54,440 --> 00:38:55,440
He doesn't know

1240
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:56,440
what shenanigans we're

1241
00:38:56,440 --> 00:38:57,440
getting up to.

1242
00:38:57,440 --> 00:38:58,440
We're going to beat this up

1243
00:38:58,440 --> 00:38:59,440
and we're going to get

1244
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:00,440
a tomato,

1245
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:01,440
a tomato.

1246
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:02,440
We're going to put it

1247
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:03,440
in the pan

1248
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:04,440
and then we just need

1249
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:05,440
to get an egg

1250
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:06,440
and then

1251
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:07,440
after the egg.

1252
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:10,440
Oh, okay.

1253
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:11,440
Hold on.

1254
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:12,440
We need to go up here.

1255
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:13,440
So we need to

1256
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:14,440
just rebuild the track

1257
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:15,440
really quickly

1258
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:16,440
and we can move the rock

1259
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:17,440
out of the way

1260
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:18,440
and then we put

1261
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:19,440
the egg in the pan

1262
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:20,440
and then we just need

1263
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:21,440
to get the egg section.

1264
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:22,440
Oh, and it'll be

1265
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:23,440
no 11 C's,

1266
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:24,440
no second lunch,

1267
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:25,440
honestly.

1268
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:26,440
I'm going to beat this up

1269
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:27,440
because there's a bit of

1270
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:28,440
wood in here.

1271
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:29,440
I want to climb back up

1272
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:30,440
after I've claimed

1273
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:31,440
back down,

1274
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:32,440
but there is a wee egg

1275
00:39:32,440 --> 00:39:33,440
in this tree.

1276
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:37,440
I'm beating up.

1277
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:38,440
I actually thought

1278
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:40,440
I fed

1279
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:41,440
my magpie

1280
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:42,440
three times yesterday

1281
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:43,440
and it's

1282
00:39:44,440 --> 00:39:45,440
Dad's magpie

1283
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:46,440
and the daughter

1284
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:47,440
and I'm like that just

1285
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:48,440
straight up call them

1286
00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:49,440
Ronnie and

1287
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:51,440
Strontium

1288
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:52,440
like me and my dad

1289
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:53,440
as magpies

1290
00:39:54,440 --> 00:39:55,440
because

1291
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:56,440
I'm kind of tempted to

1292
00:39:56,440 --> 00:39:57,440
where the heck is his last one?

1293
00:39:58,440 --> 00:39:59,440
Oh, it's by the tree base.

1294
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:00,440
I see it.

1295
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:02,440
Do it.

1296
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:03,440
Yeah.

1297
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:04,440
They called on me

1298
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:05,440
three times yesterday.

1299
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:06,440
I was

1300
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:07,440
so surprised.

1301
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:08,440
So

1302
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:09,440
the baby,

1303
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:10,440
like the girl,

1304
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:11,440
she was so scared

1305
00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:13,440
and she never like approached.

1306
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:14,440
Now

1307
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:15,440
now she's

1308
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:16,440
outside my door

1309
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:17,440
on

1310
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:19,440
which is literally

1311
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:20,440
the feed me call

1312
00:40:20,440 --> 00:40:22,440
as if I was a parent bird to her

1313
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:24,440
which is not

1314
00:40:24,440 --> 00:40:25,440
in the

1315
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:27,440
thing, but she

1316
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:28,440
she called on me

1317
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:29,440
while the dad wasn't there

1318
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:30,440
and I was like, right.

1319
00:40:30,440 --> 00:40:31,440
Okay.

1320
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:32,440
Put it out.

1321
00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:33,440
Nice.

1322
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:36,440
Ash on my tomatoes.

1323
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:38,440
I love the week.

1324
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:41,440
Love something bad happens to them.

1325
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:44,440
Magpies live 30 years.

1326
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:48,440
Go, go, go.

1327
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:50,440
Even the bird is calling your mommy.

1328
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:51,440
Literally,

1329
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:52,440
the thing's like

1330
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:53,440
and I'm like,

1331
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:54,440
I'll feed you,

1332
00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:56,440
but I'm not actually more hidden.

1333
00:40:56,440 --> 00:40:57,440
You can that, right?

1334
00:41:00,440 --> 00:41:01,440
Oh,

1335
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:04,440
right.

1336
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:05,440
Okay.

1337
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:06,440
So if you're going to fall off the map,

1338
00:41:06,440 --> 00:41:07,440
if you're fast enough,

1339
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:09,440
you can swap to another character

1340
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:11,440
to not take the penalty for falling off,

1341
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:13,440
which is losing some of your money.

1342
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:15,440
I was so sorry, Sam.

1343
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:16,440
I didn't mean it.

1344
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:17,440
You're,

1345
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:19,440
you just had such a reach.

1346
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:20,440
Okay.

1347
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:21,440
You just had such a reach.

1348
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:23,440
Do you have problems with the cats

1349
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:24,440
and the magpies fighting?

1350
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:25,440
No.

1351
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:26,440
Gimli likes watching them.

1352
00:41:26,440 --> 00:41:27,440
So

1353
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:29,440
one time,

1354
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:31,440
Gimli may or may not almost

1355
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:32,440
escaped and

1356
00:41:32,440 --> 00:41:33,440
tried to hunt

1357
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:35,440
strongy the magpie,

1358
00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:38,440
but obviously I stopped her in time

1359
00:41:38,440 --> 00:41:39,440
and I opened up my arms

1360
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:41,440
to make the magpie fly away

1361
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:43,440
because I never do that kind of thing

1362
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:44,440
around them,

1363
00:41:44,440 --> 00:41:46,440
and I would stress them out or whatever.

1364
00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:47,440
So when I did it,

1365
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:48,440
the magpie knew something was wrong,

1366
00:41:48,440 --> 00:41:50,440
but whenever I throw cashews out,

1367
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:53,440
Gimli goes to the window to watch them

1368
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:55,440
or I leave the door open

1369
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:57,440
because they walk right up to the door.

1370
00:41:57,440 --> 00:41:58,440
They're not messing around.

1371
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:01,440
I was very stressful.

1372
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:02,440
I can laugh on it now,

1373
00:42:02,440 --> 00:42:03,440
but I kid you not,

1374
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:05,440
if Gimli did something,

1375
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:06,440
I would be distraught

1376
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:07,440
because I love my magpies.

1377
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:08,440
I really do.

1378
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:11,440
But they're really good cat TV

1379
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:13,440
entertainment when you feed them.

1380
00:42:14,440 --> 00:42:17,440
I buy small bird feed mix as well

1381
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:18,440
for the pigeons

1382
00:42:18,440 --> 00:42:20,440
because the pigeons beaks.

1383
00:42:20,440 --> 00:42:23,440
So magpies have incredibly strong beaks,

1384
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:26,440
but pigeons beaks can't handle it.

1385
00:42:26,440 --> 00:42:28,440
Seagulls beaks can't handle it.

1386
00:42:28,440 --> 00:42:30,440
So I do buy small mix as well

1387
00:42:30,440 --> 00:42:31,440
for the wee birds.

1388
00:42:32,440 --> 00:42:33,440
They're quite cute.

1389
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:34,440
They're quite cute.

1390
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:36,440
Oh, rather cute.

1391
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:40,440
Gimli watching her prey.

1392
00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:42,440
She is a hunter.

1393
00:42:42,440 --> 00:42:45,440
Sorry, but she's so dangerous.

1394
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:48,440
It's insane to watch her body language

1395
00:42:48,440 --> 00:42:53,440
change when she spots a bird as well.

1396
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:56,440
A completely different body language.

1397
00:42:56,440 --> 00:42:57,440
Her ears get pinned back.

1398
00:42:57,440 --> 00:42:59,440
She's so excited.

1399
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:01,440
She starts chirping.

1400
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:02,440
Oh, this.

1401
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:04,440
It's quite scary.

1402
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:07,440
Is Gimli one of the short cats?

1403
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:08,440
No.

1404
00:43:08,440 --> 00:43:11,440
Vigo is the one who's afflicted with half munchkin.

1405
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:16,440
So he doesn't have very good joints, thankfully.

1406
00:43:16,440 --> 00:43:19,440
He is mixed with a full breed of tabby.

1407
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:21,440
So he's not as unhealthy,

1408
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:24,440
but I'm aware that he doesn't have his good jump.

1409
00:43:26,440 --> 00:43:28,440
One time my half angle was outside

1410
00:43:28,440 --> 00:43:29,440
and found wild mice.

1411
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:30,440
She didn't know what to do,

1412
00:43:30,440 --> 00:43:31,440
so she just meowed loudly

1413
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:33,440
and watched them run around.

1414
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:35,440
Stop fucking.

1415
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:36,440
Oh, sorry.

1416
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:39,440
Just walked off the map.

1417
00:43:40,440 --> 00:43:44,440
Gimli is the one

1418
00:43:44,440 --> 00:43:47,440
that has the strongest hunter's instinct.

1419
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:51,440
Vigo caught a rat out of nowhere.

1420
00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:55,440
He almost brought it inside the house.

1421
00:43:55,440 --> 00:43:56,440
I was like,

1422
00:43:57,440 --> 00:43:59,440
don't, don't.

1423
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:00,440
I managed to stop him

1424
00:44:00,440 --> 00:44:02,440
before he came through the cat flap,

1425
00:44:02,440 --> 00:44:03,440
but I was like,

1426
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:06,440
do not bring a rat into this host.

1427
00:44:06,440 --> 00:44:08,440
Because, yeah,

1428
00:44:08,440 --> 00:44:10,440
I was so surprised he caught it,

1429
00:44:10,440 --> 00:44:13,440
but I think he's secretly a good hunter as well.

1430
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:14,440
Just not birds,

1431
00:44:14,440 --> 00:44:17,440
but I think he's good at pest control like that.

1432
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:20,440
But it was a gift.

1433
00:44:20,440 --> 00:44:21,440
Oh, no.

1434
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:22,440
I went outside and praised him for it

1435
00:44:22,440 --> 00:44:23,440
and gave him treats,

1436
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:25,440
but they don't bring it inside the host.

1437
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:27,440
That didn't want any thingy,

1438
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:32,440
but cats are very good for pest control like that.

1439
00:44:32,440 --> 00:44:33,440
I mean, I could like,

1440
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:36,440
oh, maybe I should do that in my education stream.

1441
00:44:36,440 --> 00:44:37,440
I should like,

1442
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:38,440
say can we go to Sam's

1443
00:44:38,440 --> 00:44:40,440
so I can actually see what I'm doing.

1444
00:44:42,440 --> 00:44:45,440
This is the most annoying quest ever.

1445
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:47,440
It is so annoying.

1446
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:50,440
So these guys like follow you around

1447
00:44:50,440 --> 00:44:53,440
and it's just silliness.

1448
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:56,440
They like kind of half attack, half don't.

1449
00:44:56,440 --> 00:44:58,440
I don't know if you can tell on screen.

1450
00:44:58,440 --> 00:45:00,440
They're currently attacking Frodo.

1451
00:45:00,440 --> 00:45:02,440
So when I have to swap back to Frodo,

1452
00:45:02,440 --> 00:45:05,440
he's going to get attacked and I just,

1453
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:08,440
this is probably one of the most like,

1454
00:45:08,440 --> 00:45:09,440
not frustrating.

1455
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:11,440
It's not that bad if you know what to do,

1456
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:13,440
but the first time you play the sequence,

1457
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:15,440
it's like, bro, leave me alone.

1458
00:45:15,440 --> 00:45:19,440
Perhaps he wants to feed you food, honestly.

1459
00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:22,440
But no,

1460
00:45:22,440 --> 00:45:24,440
maybe the education of why cats

1461
00:45:24,440 --> 00:45:27,440
have always been so loved in society

1462
00:45:27,440 --> 00:45:29,440
is because of pest control.

1463
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:31,440
They help with the population.

1464
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:34,440
They help with ensuring that,

1465
00:45:34,440 --> 00:45:35,440
sorry, I just need to check

1466
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:38,440
where the last one is, maybe this one.

1467
00:45:38,440 --> 00:45:41,440
And then Frodo deals with the other two.

1468
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:45,440
You thought they were drunk, literally.

1469
00:45:45,440 --> 00:45:47,440
Like they hover around,

1470
00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:50,440
but if you get touched by them,

1471
00:45:50,440 --> 00:45:52,440
you basically get locked into this really annoying

1472
00:45:52,440 --> 00:45:54,440
animation that you need to fight out of

1473
00:45:54,440 --> 00:45:55,440
and it's like, eh.

1474
00:45:55,440 --> 00:45:58,440
Just let me make my progress.

1475
00:45:58,440 --> 00:45:59,440
Just let me make my progress

1476
00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:01,440
and my favorite video game.

1477
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:03,440
Life is like a video game.

1478
00:46:03,440 --> 00:46:05,440
But yeah, once you're Frodo,

1479
00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:06,440
you build two fires

1480
00:46:06,440 --> 00:46:08,440
and you just go straight back to Sam

1481
00:46:08,440 --> 00:46:10,440
and it's all easy peasy.

1482
00:46:10,440 --> 00:46:11,440
The game will indicate

1483
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:12,440
if you no longer have to do any,

1484
00:46:12,440 --> 00:46:14,440
oh, I just, you didn't see that.

1485
00:46:14,440 --> 00:46:15,440
I may or may not have just

1486
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:18,440
scolded myself in the fire by accident.

1487
00:46:18,440 --> 00:46:20,440
Has Johnny played straight?

1488
00:46:20,440 --> 00:46:21,440
I have.

1489
00:46:21,440 --> 00:46:23,440
I did it in one stream,

1490
00:46:23,440 --> 00:46:24,440
one full VOD,

1491
00:46:24,440 --> 00:46:27,440
so if you ever wanted to watch that, you can.

1492
00:46:27,440 --> 00:46:29,440
I think it took me like,

1493
00:46:29,440 --> 00:46:31,440
five hours to do.

1494
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:34,440
But if you ever wanted to catch up on a VOD,

1495
00:46:34,440 --> 00:46:36,440
I always just recommend

1496
00:46:36,440 --> 00:46:39,440
maybe like doing it on 1.5 speed.

1497
00:46:41,440 --> 00:46:43,440
Two, I start to sound a bit squeaky

1498
00:46:43,440 --> 00:46:45,440
if you two times me.

1499
00:46:45,440 --> 00:46:48,440
One time my orange cat, Salron,

1500
00:46:48,440 --> 00:46:50,440
the moment she sees anything

1501
00:46:50,440 --> 00:46:52,440
she considers it prey,

1502
00:46:52,440 --> 00:46:54,440
her ears pin back,

1503
00:46:54,440 --> 00:46:56,440
oh, her ears pin back,

1504
00:46:56,440 --> 00:46:58,440
and once I go in full evil mode.

1505
00:46:58,440 --> 00:47:01,440
Yeah, they're pupils' dialy, so cute.

1506
00:47:01,440 --> 00:47:03,440
Stray's so good, I love it.

1507
00:47:03,440 --> 00:47:05,440
She sang every time too.

1508
00:47:05,440 --> 00:47:07,440
Yeah, we gave music to the music guy,

1509
00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:08,440
like the sheet,

1510
00:47:08,440 --> 00:47:11,440
and I just started randomly making up songs,

1511
00:47:11,440 --> 00:47:13,440
which was quite fun.

1512
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:14,440
What do I need to do?

1513
00:47:14,440 --> 00:47:17,440
I think, if I'm not mistaken,

1514
00:47:17,440 --> 00:47:20,440
we need to burn the wraiths manually.

1515
00:47:21,440 --> 00:47:24,440
As I said, there's a few things

1516
00:47:24,440 --> 00:47:26,440
in this game that's like,

1517
00:47:26,440 --> 00:47:29,440
but it's honestly, in the grand scheme of things,

1518
00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:30,440
it's not that bad.

1519
00:47:30,440 --> 00:47:33,440
So I told Sam to make this fire,

1520
00:47:33,440 --> 00:47:35,440
and then, oh, you didn't see that.

1521
00:47:35,440 --> 00:47:37,440
You didn't see that? That was embarrassing.

1522
00:47:37,440 --> 00:47:40,440
But we're basically going around the map

1523
00:47:40,440 --> 00:47:42,440
and trying to find a stone

1524
00:47:42,440 --> 00:47:44,440
so we can get a new torch,

1525
00:47:44,440 --> 00:47:46,440
and then we're going to light the torch on fire,

1526
00:47:46,440 --> 00:47:48,440
and then we're going to whack it on them.

1527
00:47:48,440 --> 00:47:52,440
As I said, the campaign is just a really well-rounded game.

1528
00:47:52,440 --> 00:47:55,440
I may be biased because I really enjoy

1529
00:47:55,440 --> 00:47:56,440
the Lord of the Rings,

1530
00:47:56,440 --> 00:47:59,440
but for me, it's very...

1531
00:48:03,440 --> 00:48:06,440
My game just froze!

1532
00:48:06,440 --> 00:48:09,440
No! Not me praising how well-rounded the game is,

1533
00:48:09,440 --> 00:48:11,440
and it froze! You didn't see that.

1534
00:48:11,440 --> 00:48:12,440
It is a good game.

1535
00:48:12,440 --> 00:48:14,440
I promise it's a good game.

1536
00:48:14,440 --> 00:48:16,440
You didn't see that.

1537
00:48:16,440 --> 00:48:18,440
I'm so... I'm sorry.

1538
00:48:18,440 --> 00:48:19,440
Okay, it's a good game.

1539
00:48:19,440 --> 00:48:21,440
Right, where the heck is this last piece of rock

1540
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:22,440
that I need to throw?

1541
00:48:22,440 --> 00:48:24,440
Oh, wait, is it in Sam's pocket?

1542
00:48:24,440 --> 00:48:25,440
Yeah, the game does that

1543
00:48:25,440 --> 00:48:27,440
where they'll hide an item in the pocket of someone,

1544
00:48:27,440 --> 00:48:29,440
and you're like, rub, please.

1545
00:48:30,440 --> 00:48:31,440
Just like that.

1546
00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:33,440
You jinxed it. I literally did.

1547
00:48:33,440 --> 00:48:34,440
I actually did.

1548
00:48:34,440 --> 00:48:35,440
It is a good game.

1549
00:48:35,440 --> 00:48:37,440
Okay, by panic there.

1550
00:48:37,440 --> 00:48:40,440
The game does have good auto-save features.

1551
00:48:42,440 --> 00:48:44,440
Morgal blend.

1552
00:48:47,440 --> 00:48:49,440
I almost underprinted straight on my first playthrough.

1553
00:48:49,440 --> 00:48:50,440
Oh, no.

1554
00:48:51,440 --> 00:48:54,440
I didn't do exploring like that in the game.

1555
00:48:57,440 --> 00:48:59,440
Weathertop completo!

1556
00:48:59,440 --> 00:49:01,440
We've already done three missions.

1557
00:49:02,440 --> 00:49:04,440
A regorne son of our...

1558
00:49:17,440 --> 00:49:19,440
I love the visual gags and all that.

1559
00:49:19,440 --> 00:49:22,440
Please wait until we get to the funeral.

1560
00:49:23,440 --> 00:49:25,440
I crack up.

1561
00:49:25,440 --> 00:49:26,440
I don't know if...

1562
00:49:26,440 --> 00:49:27,440
Because I'm expecting to laugh at it,

1563
00:49:27,440 --> 00:49:28,440
I probably won't laugh,

1564
00:49:28,440 --> 00:49:30,440
but I crack up at the funeral,

1565
00:49:30,440 --> 00:49:32,440
but it's absolutely outrageous.

1566
00:49:35,440 --> 00:49:37,440
Absolutely outrageous.

1567
00:49:39,440 --> 00:49:40,440
Boom.

1568
00:49:40,440 --> 00:49:41,440
I've already done three.

1569
00:49:41,440 --> 00:49:43,440
I tried Little Kitty Big City.

1570
00:49:43,440 --> 00:49:44,440
It was kind of like Goose Game and Street,

1571
00:49:44,440 --> 00:49:45,440
but it kept making me think

1572
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:48,440
about how much I want to be back in a city from Street.

1573
00:49:49,440 --> 00:49:50,440
Oh, no.

1574
00:49:50,440 --> 00:49:51,440
Frodo got stabbed.

1575
00:49:51,440 --> 00:49:55,440
But a pretty lady's going to save him.

1576
00:49:56,440 --> 00:49:57,440
I win.

1577
00:49:58,440 --> 00:50:00,440
Ooh, you're so pretty.

1578
00:50:00,440 --> 00:50:03,440
You're so ethereal without even trying.

1579
00:50:05,440 --> 00:50:06,440
He really said,

1580
00:50:06,440 --> 00:50:07,440
oh, pretty lady.

1581
00:50:07,440 --> 00:50:09,440
Well, look at that hair twirl.

1582
00:50:09,440 --> 00:50:12,440
Look at those lines to indicate a female Lego.

1583
00:50:15,440 --> 00:50:16,440
Ooh.

1584
00:50:18,440 --> 00:50:19,440
Ooh.

1585
00:50:20,440 --> 00:50:21,440
He's fading.

1586
00:50:22,440 --> 00:50:23,440
He's fading.

1587
00:50:24,440 --> 00:50:25,440
Replings hold on.

1588
00:50:25,440 --> 00:50:26,440
She's at home.

1589
00:50:26,440 --> 00:50:28,440
I've been looking for you for two days.

1590
00:50:28,440 --> 00:50:29,440
Where are you taking him?

1591
00:50:29,440 --> 00:50:31,440
We must get him to my room.

1592
00:50:31,440 --> 00:50:32,440
Frodo.

1593
00:50:32,440 --> 00:50:34,440
I offered only a gear.

1594
00:50:34,440 --> 00:50:35,440
Torquoise me, baby.

1595
00:50:35,440 --> 00:50:36,440
Wow.

1596
00:50:36,440 --> 00:50:38,440
I do not fear them.

1597
00:50:38,440 --> 00:50:39,440
I used them.

1598
00:50:39,440 --> 00:50:40,440
Honestly.

1599
00:50:44,440 --> 00:50:45,440
Ne.

1600
00:50:45,440 --> 00:50:46,440
It's okay.

1601
00:50:46,440 --> 00:50:47,440
There, there, Frodo.

1602
00:50:47,440 --> 00:50:48,440
You'll feel better soon enough.

1603
00:50:55,440 --> 00:50:57,440
We're done.

1604
00:50:57,440 --> 00:50:58,440
See?

1605
00:50:58,440 --> 00:50:59,440
Already into the next mission.

1606
00:51:00,440 --> 00:51:01,440
He's fading.

1607
00:51:01,440 --> 00:51:02,440
Like my hairline.

1608
00:51:02,440 --> 00:51:03,440
Oh, no.

1609
00:51:05,440 --> 00:51:06,440
What leafing sore.

1610
00:51:06,440 --> 00:51:11,640
why does the lego girl have a 60 block?

1611
00:51:11,640 --> 00:51:13,400
oh obviously

1612
00:51:13,400 --> 00:51:15,640
oh what do you mean you don't want to shag a piece of lego?

1613
00:51:20,840 --> 00:51:26,040
obviously the scene was a bit more impactful in the actual movie but lord of the rings they

1614
00:51:26,040 --> 00:51:28,360
did it justice i think they did it justice

1615
00:51:28,440 --> 00:51:30,360
wow

1616
00:51:34,520 --> 00:51:38,280
so we are now heading to the lovely elden

1617
00:51:38,920 --> 00:51:44,680
it's not really a village it's like a city is it a citadel would it be described as a citadel

1618
00:51:44,680 --> 00:51:48,520
i don't know but we head in there we shmoving along on the horse

1619
00:51:49,480 --> 00:51:49,960

1635
00:53:19,160 --> 00:53:23,640
old oh hold on do you want to hear the voiceline i'm gonna see if she's here oh no she's not

1636
00:53:26,040 --> 00:53:32,280
uh i spoke about having a voiceline i thought it was because i'm an elf over here

1637
00:53:32,840 --> 00:53:37,720
but i might maybe it's the hobbit it might be the hobbit right i'm not going that way that's the

1638
00:53:37,720 --> 00:53:44,600
one way you're among the elves done done done done done done right we're gonna unlock the teleport

00:54:14,760 --> 00:54:18,040
um the the fellowship of the ring if you will

1644
00:54:20,600 --> 00:54:22,600
begin

1645
00:54:31,320 --> 00:54:36,600
so

1646
00:54:40,040 --> 00:54:43,240
one does not simply a gift to the foes of mordor

1647
00:54:44,520 --> 00:54:50,840
why not use this ring you cannot wield it none of us can one ring answers to sauron alone

1648
00:54:50,840 --> 00:54:56,120
and watch would arrange you know this matter this is no mere range

1649
00:54:57,080 --> 00:55:03,720
oh my god lego lego last literally just went in actually

1650
00:55:05,160 --> 00:55:06,680

00:55:16,360 --> 00:55:21,240
lego lego i literally i started saying lego last because i was like wait i'm playing lego but

1652
00:55:21,240 --> 00:55:24,360
his name is lego last yet no literally i started

1653
00:55:30,680 --> 00:55:32,680
this is indeed the will of the council

1654
00:55:34,920 --> 00:55:36,840
mr furtows not going anywhere without me

1655
00:55:39,960 --> 00:55:40,760
we're coming to

1656
00:55:43,480 --> 00:55:48,040
nine companions you shall be the fellowship of the ring

1657
00:55:51,960 --> 00:55:55,960
oh they get to meet each other

1658
00:55:58,440 --> 00:55:59,080
my throat

1659
00:56:01,560 --> 00:56:02,920
i'll protect them

1660
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:08,040
oh my god

1661
00:56:08,040 --> 00:56:15,400
it glows blue when orcs are closed and it's times like that my lad when you have to be extra careful

1662
00:56:16,440 --> 00:56:17,400
lego last way

1663
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:24,200
the ring bearer is setting out on the quest mount

1664
00:56:25,080 --> 00:56:27,400
the fellowship awaits the ring bearer

1665
00:56:31,160 --> 00:56:31,880
huh

1666
00:56:38,840 --> 00:56:41,480
oh at least he washed his hand

1667
00:56:43,400 --> 00:56:44,040
at least you

1668
00:56:53,880 --> 00:56:58,920
bye bye i love you arwin oh my god you guys should get married and have babies or something

1669
00:56:59,720 --> 00:57:02,200
i don't know quest of men

1670
00:57:03,320 --> 00:57:05,240
i thought this thing was the coolest when i was young

1671
00:57:07,400 --> 00:57:09,480
we have formed the fellowship

1672
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:14,280
look at me i'm proto baggins and i have loads of equipment now

1673
00:57:16,920 --> 00:57:21,880
the physical comedy of the lego games are superior literally imagine trying to sum up

1674
00:57:21,880 --> 00:57:26,040
all the dialogue and things that happen in a film within a two-minute cut scene

1675
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:35,640
like you're trying to mass compress like the tiniest thing into uh literally two

1676
00:57:35,640 --> 00:57:42,040
minutes uh no massive ass things until like a tiny funny ha ha thing um and you have to

1677
00:57:42,040 --> 00:57:47,240
put your own spin of humor on it as well and i'm like bro i do not envy the writers but yes

1678
00:57:47,240 --> 00:57:53,000
we've unlocked lego last so elves can double jump um and they also have bow and arrow access so

1679
00:57:53,080 --> 00:58:00,120
we do have slightly more mechanics unlocked gimley can actually my cat is going to be

1680
00:58:00,120 --> 00:58:07,960
going nuts thinking i'm talking about her gimley can destroy heavy plates on the ground now so

1681
00:58:08,840 --> 00:58:13,720
we're already starting to unlock the core mechanics when we go back and play missions

1682
00:58:13,720 --> 00:58:21,880
we are now going to do the pass of car i can never say it right but you're not ready for this

1683
00:58:21,880 --> 00:58:29,320
but all i'm going to say to you is the ladi da okay i'm saying ladi da and then when we listen

1684
00:58:29,320 --> 00:58:34,440
to the background of this mission please tell me you do not hear him literally go ladi da okay

1685
00:58:35,640 --> 00:58:43,960
your cat can break plates real he's slipping did you know in the film production everyone was

1686
00:58:43,960 --> 00:58:49,080
getting smacked in the eyes with like this horrible material and everyone's eyes were read in these

1687
00:58:49,080 --> 00:58:54,040
scenes because they were getting bra it shoved in their face with all the fake snow

1688
00:59:03,560 --> 00:59:08,600
i don't know man kind of like you cared a little bit there handing over sassy

1689
00:59:08,600 --> 00:59:15,640

1690
00:59:15,640 --> 00:59:22,120
cutest mechanic ever we can also toss him just thought you should know you know very lower friendly

1691
00:59:22,120 --> 00:59:28,680
very lower accurate more cool trivia yes if you look at the behind the scenes when they were doing

1692
00:59:28,680 --> 00:59:34,600
the snow scenes everyone hated it because they were getting like obliterated in their eyeballs

1693
00:59:34,600 --> 00:59:41,400
it was terrible white substance and red eyes you say how do you i actually already need to pee

1699
01:00:28,680 --> 01:00:36,680
ah and then yeah okay there we go uh the game can be a bit uh pernicate like that which is a bit

1700
01:00:36,680 --> 01:00:43,400
annoying but it is what it is it's not like a big hole breaker sure right here no that's icy in the

1701
01:00:43,400 --> 01:00:51,960
snowberries thing you're not inhaling my pants all right we'll finish this mission i will very

1702
01:00:51,960 --> 01:00:56,120
quickly go and pee it will literally be a millisecond because i've already got all my drinks and stuff

1703
01:00:56,120 --> 01:01:06,280
and when i get hungry later um i can definitely it's not this one but the next one has like a

1704
01:01:06,280 --> 01:01:15,560
hidden thing under it i don't think we can okay and then we build strongy need no sport star right

1705
01:01:15,560 --> 01:01:21,400
thank you too whoa hold wait that was an inside thought that came out i'm sorry please forgive i

1706
01:01:21,400 --> 01:01:31,800
wasn't thinking yeah i got like i think i got four hours of sleep or something oh you never saw that

1707
01:01:31,800 --> 01:01:40,360
it was a it was a mistake right hold on let's try that again yeah um but right where is legolas

1708
01:01:40,360 --> 01:01:47,480
you are next why so little sleep fill up doing stuff like i had to prepare the notes for the

1709
01:01:47,480 --> 01:01:56,920
meeting and um i was up working and i've recorded the audio i literally just need to put the sfx so

1710
01:01:56,920 --> 01:02:04,120
after the stream um gives me like 30 minutes and i will upload the audio on patreon thank you everyone

1711
01:02:04,120 --> 01:02:11,320
for your unwavering patience for me but um yes the audio has been recorded it's been cut up i

1712
01:02:11,320 --> 01:02:18,120
literally just need to put down the sfx where i rip your pants off violently um and then you guys can

1713
01:02:18,120 --> 01:02:25,080
enjoy the hilarity that was creating that audio it was absolutely outrageous it was outrageous but

1714
01:02:25,560 --> 01:02:31,560
i figured that you guys are more than patient and you understand that if an audio is literally

1715
01:02:31,560 --> 01:02:39,080
12 hours late that it's not like um schemas and or anything and it's just what happened

1716
01:02:40,520 --> 01:02:46,120
and when we try to get a seven hour sleep challenge is it impossible i don't know we're

1717
01:02:46,120 --> 01:02:53,320
gonna find out this is a job for legolas now the game normally does guide you oh wait hold on nope

1718
01:02:53,320 --> 01:03:00,040
take your bow and arrow out and then do this and then we can just swing across okay i guess just

1719
01:03:00,040 --> 01:03:08,520
do one uh so gimley can't get up here until you do like character select like a free play that's

1720
01:03:08,520 --> 01:03:16,120
what it's called when you do free play in this game um thank you for everything you do amina oh

1721
01:03:16,120 --> 01:03:23,640
you're more than welcome yes uh once i upload that then that is you know the month of july

1722
01:03:24,440 --> 01:03:28,840
um completely dealt with i don't know if i've hit all those i don't know if you can do it in the

1723
01:03:28,840 --> 01:03:32,600
first round i'm falling off the map sorry if you saw that i was falling off the map and i panicked

1724
01:03:33,240 --> 01:03:40,440
um and then we get to uh there's been good progress with scripts behind the scenes um

1725
01:03:40,440 --> 01:03:48,680
um who or what is this a gimley one or is this a photo one there's nothing uh a sam one no it must

1726
01:03:48,680 --> 01:03:54,680
be gimley when you unlock a new mechanic the game does get you to do it like a billion times over

1727
01:03:54,680 --> 01:04:02,920
and it's like red it is it's gonna matter i love this game more than the movie i mean this game's

1728
01:04:02,920 --> 01:04:08,680
a lot easier to like tune out to whereas i would argue the lord of the rings me

1729
01:04:11,400 --> 01:04:18,760
that terrified me i did not expect to hear anyone talk and i was like uh excuse me what the actual

1730
01:04:18,760 --> 01:04:30,280
fuck are you doing in my house um yes um i'm gonna work on ac's youtube roleplay next because

1731
01:04:30,280 --> 01:04:36,520
i'm very excited for that to come out um and she was like so happy i don't know if you guys

1732
01:04:36,600 --> 01:04:41,080
managed to watch her comeback stream type thing she was so happy to be back and i'm so happy

1733
01:04:42,360 --> 01:04:48,600
i'm so happy ow ow i just got fucking walloped by a rock but i'm so happy that she's happy type

1734
01:04:48,600 --> 01:04:56,360
thing um like it's the simple things in life just the simple things uh right i think we get

1735
01:04:56,360 --> 01:05:04,200
ah why am i so bad at timing this i'm getting hurt everywhere right where is i need a human to

1736
01:05:04,200 --> 01:05:10,200
you'll need to toss me i'm working on it i'm working on it i'm working on it you stop you you stop

1737
01:05:10,200 --> 01:05:17,720
jumping up and down there young man go um she was happy to see the snowberries again um it was just

1738
01:05:17,720 --> 01:05:26,040
one month uh one week yeah but she loved this right what's this it is a dig so we actually

1739
01:05:26,040 --> 01:05:31,560
need sam to come over so we're gonna go grab sam we're gonna manually jump him over and we're

1740
01:05:31,560 --> 01:05:37,320
gonna go back on you and we'll grab you then we're gonna bring you over uh the writers were quoted

1741
01:05:38,360 --> 01:05:44,120
and i do have like this month like so much behind the scenes progress that's going to be made i had

1742
01:05:44,120 --> 01:05:53,880
like a really big update i've got a second manager uh in the works um as well but i did warn the girls

1743
01:05:53,880 --> 01:06:02,280
if and when they come into play uh the that manager is not as nice as me uh and not as lenient

1744
01:06:02,280 --> 01:06:10,360
when it comes to things so you know just warning you know um they get shit done

1745
01:06:12,120 --> 01:06:17,880
but i have warned them that if and when but they are there's two managers that are gonna come in

1746
01:06:18,840 --> 01:06:23,160
a later date and one of them's super nice and the other one's a bit of a hard ass and

1747
01:06:24,040 --> 01:06:28,920
but i am needing needing some results eggs eggs the need some results

1748
01:06:30,280 --> 01:06:37,240
then me the new manager has a big sick sam what are you doing go back down sam and now

1749
01:06:37,240 --> 01:06:42,120
gimley's coming out so i can't come see this one doorway system sam if you stayed down we didn't

1750
01:06:42,120 --> 01:06:49,880
we wouldn't have had to do this bad cop good cop i mean it's not on purpose but i know this manager

1751
01:06:49,880 --> 01:06:57,640
will get the results type thing and whereas like you know i'm just like i'll let you do what you

1752
01:06:57,640 --> 01:07:03,640
want for the most part but you know yeah oh wait hold on you didn't see that that was about wait

1753
01:07:03,640 --> 01:07:06,440
why did that not get on the board right okay there you go

1754
01:07:08,360 --> 01:07:11,800
am i too late okay now go let's go

1755
01:07:13,560 --> 01:07:18,040
and oh we did it i didn't realize we could actually do this one and then if you come to the end you

1756
01:07:18,040 --> 01:07:23,320
actually get the recipe as well there's it's just a little bit hidden off map there are a few instances

1757
01:07:23,320 --> 01:07:31,960
of that happening the bad cop is the one that makes people work better plausible and

1758
01:07:34,040 --> 01:07:37,720
very plausible as i said they aren't coming in until much later

1759
01:07:40,040 --> 01:07:44,760
blah blah blah and we're going to melt this and then everyone can jump across and then we'll

1760
01:07:44,760 --> 01:07:49,320
get legolas to shoot those and then we're done already there's another level down like play

1761
01:07:49,320 --> 01:07:55,800
this game is just so fantastic you can tune out you can try hard as much as you like for any of

1762
01:07:55,800 --> 01:08:02,680
that sometimes it does glitch out just a little bit and but that comes later the dwarf toss is

1763
01:08:02,680 --> 01:08:07,800
such a great game but there you go look now everyone can jump across the platforms we're

1764
01:08:07,800 --> 01:08:13,800
going to go on legolas and then shoot this and then throw gimley and then that's

1765
01:08:17,960 --> 01:08:23,960
you know you can shoot two things at once i uh dictate right for 2012 a very polished game

1766
01:08:23,960 --> 01:08:33,160
wait Assassin's Creed came out before this game i'm learning okay now just run ahead literally

1767
01:08:33,160 --> 01:08:40,440
just run ahead to end it as you can see the camera's like a thunderbolt not this time though

1768
01:08:40,440 --> 01:08:43,240
hydration check replays make sure you're hydrated

1769
01:08:43,640 --> 01:08:56,440
well thunder battle is in the whole bit i remember watching the thunder bell in the whole

1770
01:08:56,440 --> 01:09:08,760
bit i was like what the fuck what do you just say fruto you got me hard decisions

1771
01:09:08,840 --> 01:09:12,280
we will go through the minds the minds of moria

1772
01:09:22,840 --> 01:09:25,160
ac1 and 2 came out before this game i'm not sure about

1773
01:09:25,880 --> 01:09:27,160
when

1774
01:09:36,120 --> 01:09:45,560
oh yeah there's also elfin orc uh no elfin um dwarf uh racism because there always is

1775
01:09:45,560 --> 01:09:50,440
whenever there's like a fantasy game there's always some sort of like weird like

1776
01:09:51,400 --> 01:09:53,160
but it's like i don't know

1777
01:09:59,960 --> 01:10:06,200
i am gonna purposely purposefully break all the balls if i can find the rocks because i can

1778
01:10:06,200 --> 01:10:11,480
actually do that right now oh god i can't remember where everything is forgive me i suck

1779
01:10:11,480 --> 01:10:16,840
all right where's the fire it should be here okay sam i'm gonna need you first darlin out you come

1780
01:10:17,560 --> 01:10:24,120
um speak reefling and enter oh that is so good sweet

1781
01:10:27,560 --> 01:10:33,880
we're gonna build a fire then borrow me i need you to drop all the wood that you picked up

1782
01:10:33,880 --> 01:10:42,680
because it's on your person and then we need to do an elf over there not to be confused with

1783
01:10:42,680 --> 01:10:50,280
elfin ships and where is the last rock there should be a rock on the shore but i guess not

1784
01:10:51,960 --> 01:10:57,480
okay we got the last fire the oh wait hold on there's like a rock you are a rock that's why

1785
01:10:58,840 --> 01:11:04,760
okay we're just gonna very quickly get this uh pick up so we don't have to like it's not really

1786
01:11:04,760 --> 01:11:12,920
backtracking that much do not stir the water uh right okay i'll stir the soup then

1787
01:11:14,600 --> 01:11:20,280
not the horror that is elf on the shelf bro i've seen some bizarre videos about elf on

1788
01:11:20,280 --> 01:11:26,520
the shelf where like children are like screaming in terror because they were told like the magic

1789
01:11:26,520 --> 01:11:32,120
is lost if they touch the elf i could have sworn it was like a little sister grabbed it

1790
01:11:32,200 --> 01:11:39,800
and like the the other children were screaming bloody murder like bloody murder me and i'm like

1791
01:11:39,800 --> 01:11:44,120
oh my god how rather terrifying yep

1792
01:11:48,040 --> 01:11:53,000
we're getting there let me just very carefully walk the plank and push this down and then we

1793
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:59,160
gotta do it on one more side and then we're done see on that side we need gimley to go over here

1794
01:11:59,880 --> 01:12:03,720
oh i missed okay he's supposed to be on the floor he's supposed to be on the floor forever

1795
01:12:03,720 --> 01:12:09,000
was there a study that said elf on the shelf can cause trauma i mean i honestly wouldn't doubt it

1796
01:12:09,800 --> 01:12:16,280
i'll stir your war we'll be fine i don't want refillings i won't do elf on the shelf okay i trust

1797
01:12:16,280 --> 01:12:25,080
i won't i won't upset you like that we won't do it i wouldn't want to upset you you're darling

1798
01:12:25,080 --> 01:12:31,080
feeling you have you screaming murder because you think like the magic is gone or lost or whatever

1799
01:12:31,880 --> 01:12:39,960
okay we do that and then we break it and then we build the door and then we do the boss fight

1800
01:12:39,960 --> 01:12:46,840
and we're done another one oh yeah i'm a one step closer to full achievements in this game even though

1801
01:12:46,840 --> 01:12:50,600
i should probably be doing this on xbox right now but you know what it's fine we'll come back to it

1802
01:12:51,160 --> 01:12:56,360
i'm needing to kind of get a bit closer to the goals i was wanting to do

1803
01:12:57,240 --> 01:13:03,080
strony on the bonnie on your bonnet more like hi hi i'm strong

1804
01:13:03,960 --> 01:13:09,160
oh no worries the magic is long gone from my life oh oh that's so sad

1805
01:13:11,160 --> 01:13:16,600
i'm sure it's there just hidden in a pathway in your brain you've not used for a while

1806
01:13:16,600 --> 01:13:23,000
your little chicken thigh brain huh your little chicken breast you and you need to go to the bathroom

1807
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:28,200
break yes i need a pee i'm aware i'm currently like going side by side in my chair right now

1808
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:35,640
trying to hold in my my piss right how do i do this i can't remember is that a gimp

1809
01:13:35,640 --> 01:13:42,920
and then maybe a leg last burst that needs to do something or i think it just needs to come down

1810
01:13:42,920 --> 01:13:44,920
like any gimme

1811
01:13:47,240 --> 01:13:55,560
uh yeah okay that looks right oh wait it's multiple okay and then it's a leg last shot

1812
01:13:56,520 --> 01:14:01,720
i think gimley then leg less and gimley then leg less because you need to shoot him in the eyeball

1813
01:14:05,320 --> 01:14:11,480
the end do i not look at frodo in the back getting violently like whipped about that's such a shame

1814
01:14:11,480 --> 01:14:18,760
he's trying his best to survive okay he's trying so he's getting absolutely walloped about back there

1815
01:14:20,680 --> 01:14:25,160
hmm i keep falling asleep on my desk i need to go for a nap yep i've recommended that

1816
01:14:25,800 --> 01:14:31,960
i almost let it be on when you wake up because this is an injured dream kind of i don't know

1817
01:14:31,960 --> 01:14:36,280
i can't remember how long the campaign section takes with the speedrun up

1818
01:14:37,240 --> 01:14:41,240

1868
01:20:58,440 --> 01:21:03,880
hi johnny hi thanks for joining us we're playing lego loaded the rings but you're getting the

1869
01:21:03,880 --> 01:21:07,800
speedrun version because we're doing all the missions first as fast as we can and then we're

1870
01:21:07,800 --> 01:21:12,440
going to unlock all the characters that we need to go back and do the missions someone claimed

1871
01:21:12,440 --> 01:21:20,520
that it takes 38 hours 100 percent this game it absolutely does not i can assure you it does not

1872
01:21:20,520 --> 01:21:30,280
maybe maybe for uh can you jump up on that thank you uh maybe for a complete noob uh yeah but for

1873
01:21:30,280 --> 01:21:38,200
someone that's just so good at the game like me obviously not um minecraft lord of the rings

1874
01:21:38,760 --> 01:21:46,760
is that a thing no no i i read that wrong wait we're not at that bit i think we're at the bit

1875
01:21:46,760 --> 01:21:51,400
where we just need to be up the enemy to come through and then we're going to unlock a bigger

1876
01:21:51,400 --> 01:21:58,840
enemy that we need to deal with and lego last is very good for like sniping past all the enemies

1877
01:21:59,400 --> 01:22:05,080
and just making sure you're only hurting them until the next sequence comes they're coming

1878
01:22:05,080 --> 01:22:11,160
no do not randomly start attacking Frodo that's one thing about this game i wish didn't happen

1879
01:22:11,160 --> 01:22:16,040
you will auto attack friendlies and it's like no there's literally three enemies around of course

1880
01:22:16,040 --> 01:22:24,440
i'm not actually wanting to hurt uh Gandalf strongy scuttles our way through the mines honestly

1881
01:22:27,080 --> 01:22:32,920
you're in the mineshaft looking for diamonds i'm in the mines looking for mine

1882
01:22:35,400 --> 01:22:39,480
i don't care it's funny it's a funny meme or edit or song i don't know what it is

1883
01:22:41,000 --> 01:22:49,560
and they have a cave troll they have a cave troll does the ai take friendly damage yes i can

1884
01:22:49,560 --> 01:22:56,840
straight up like perish my allies so we need to go up here we need to break this we need to stand

1885
01:22:56,840 --> 01:23:01,880
on it and then the cave troll will lock onto us and we need to either avoid the hit but if we don't

1886
01:23:01,880 --> 01:23:07,080
it's not a big deal but climb on the chain aim at its face and then fobs your uncle and it's your

1887
01:23:07,080 --> 01:23:12,520
fanny and life's good we can see that there's something actually hidden there can you see that

1888
01:23:12,520 --> 01:23:19,720
white outline boom i just spotted it last second but we've walloped him over there so we're going

1889
01:23:19,720 --> 01:23:24,200
to come back over here now and we're going to do the exact same thing as we did before we're going

1890
01:23:24,200 --> 01:23:30,520
to stand on this the cave troll will lock onto us ai wise and then we avoid it jump on the rope

1891
01:23:30,520 --> 01:23:37,880
and hit them in the face just like that like easy peasy lamasque zove and we are going to go back up

1892
01:23:37,880 --> 01:23:41,800
because i think we need to do it a third time the classic uh need to do it three times and we're

1893
01:23:41,800 --> 01:23:53,960
good to go and wait why is it giving me that question mark why is gimley going up gimley can't walk

1894
01:23:54,360 --> 01:24:03,400
with him people sus i don't remember this i don't think he's supposed to go up there am i

1895
01:24:03,400 --> 01:24:08,120
messing this up oh my god how embarrassing imagine trying to like be like oh my god i played this

1896
01:24:08,120 --> 01:24:14,040
game so much i love this game so much and then i'm doing it wrong how embarrassing how could i forget

1897
01:24:14,040 --> 01:24:19,160
there was one in the middle how could i be so foolish in my ambitions and not lay them to rest

1898
01:24:20,120 --> 01:24:25,480
let's see ai's locked on jump oh well i was gonna wallop himself in the face oh

1899
01:24:26,760 --> 01:24:33,720
okay i forgot this bit i forgot this bit okay the blinks allegations we're hitting again poor

1900
01:24:33,720 --> 01:24:38,920
frodo can he catch a break when he gets stabbed and then healed from like a morgo blade now he's

1901
01:24:38,920 --> 01:24:44,840
getting shanked by a cave troll when he's like two feet off the ground like come on gi frodo a break

1902
01:24:44,920 --> 01:24:48,520
oh my gosh i'm guessing your luck stat goes down

1903
01:24:51,640 --> 01:24:58,440
okay now this is annoying you need legolas to be on standby to shoot the damn thing or is it

1904
01:24:58,440 --> 01:25:05,560
ah i'm an idiot yep or else you have to go through that sequence all over again and his

1905
01:25:05,560 --> 01:25:12,120
fucking get out of my way you bam okay now this is when i need the little guys to jump on

1906
01:25:13,320 --> 01:25:20,280
the enemy i'm not mistaken i can get any of them to jump on his back or am i making this up

1907
01:25:20,920 --> 01:25:25,320
i'm gonna be honest i've forgotten this one oh no hold on there's a little little ring

1908
01:25:27,800 --> 01:25:32,040
so again you need to get in position to help legolas shoot him in the mouth basically so i'm

1909
01:25:32,120 --> 01:25:36,920
gonna put him in the middle and face him like this on purpose and i'm gonna get legolas i'm

1910
01:25:36,920 --> 01:25:48,040
gonna bring him over and pray that that random enemy doesn't i'm gonna pray that a random enemy

1911
01:25:48,040 --> 01:25:59,960
doesn't do that very exact thing um yeah um so i again just do the exact same thing if you

1912
01:25:59,960 --> 01:26:04,360
cannot enable yourself to do this as fast as possible life is easy people and it's a loser

1913
01:26:05,640 --> 01:26:10,280
i can see that legolas has an enemy right on him so that's perfect timing just to really upset me

1914
01:26:10,920 --> 01:26:16,040
the game knows how to upset me very well it does of course get out of my face honestly boom and then

1915
01:26:16,040 --> 01:26:24,120
we're done never just sitting here on the floor proof photo i was just saying the red brick that

1916
01:26:24,120 --> 01:26:28,680
gives you invincibility is very satisfying because like yeah what you're gonna do you can't hurt me

1917
01:26:29,560 --> 01:26:34,920
you can't hurt me yeah he has courage

1918
01:26:37,240 --> 01:26:41,320
it's blinding oh i'm putting no likes on

1919
01:26:48,440 --> 01:26:49,160
to the bridge

1920
01:26:49,480 --> 01:27:01,400
oh i forgot about this little baby mission

1921
01:27:04,040 --> 01:27:09,640
i'm gonna say controversial not all goblins can crawl upside down on the ceiling i feel like

1922
01:27:09,640 --> 01:27:14,360
some of them would fall down i said what i said okay i don't i don't trust them all right i'm gonna

1923
01:27:14,360 --> 01:27:21,720
be legolas so every time we kill how many is identified a Gandalf will move us forward to

1924
01:27:21,720 --> 01:27:28,280
the next objection objective objection is what they say in court when they don't agree with something

1925
01:27:28,280 --> 01:27:36,680
i don't know i don't know i don't know but um yeah i've actually forgotten how many missions

1926
01:27:36,680 --> 01:27:41,960
are in this game but i want to say we're doing okay we're on we're on time for the world record

1927
01:27:41,960 --> 01:27:47,160
we absolutely or not i'm sure there's some massive exploit that lets you finish the game in two hours

1928
01:27:47,160 --> 01:27:52,040
i used to watch tons of speed runs on games that i enjoyed just to be like wait so how fast

1929
01:27:52,040 --> 01:27:59,080
these people finish it um and i was always like mortified by the result i remember typing in like

1930
01:27:59,080 --> 01:28:05,240
the speed run record for pokemon ruby because like that game the fastest i've ever done it is

1931
01:28:05,240 --> 01:28:10,680
like in one sit in like 12 hours and the speed run is like one hour 58 minutes and i'm like

1932
01:28:12,280 --> 01:28:18,920
okay talk about me like not being um fucking fast as fuck boy

1933
01:28:20,760 --> 01:28:28,440
objective based on e goblina oh my god goblin girl for gen four confirmed

1934
01:28:30,200 --> 01:28:33,240
that's right the gen four jokes are starting already how dare you

1935
01:28:33,720 --> 01:28:42,280
you 100% in eight hour yeah that's no happening with me no chance absolutely no chance

1936
01:28:50,840 --> 01:28:56,120
let's go run run run run as fast as you can you can't catch me on the gingerbread man

1937
01:28:56,360 --> 01:29:06,360
um i'm not maybe one day okay so there's a little goofy door mechanic area

1938
01:29:07,080 --> 01:29:12,200
which i think is cute but i like it so pippin's little ability at where the heck is he on the

1939
01:29:12,200 --> 01:29:20,760
deal pippin pippin he has water he has a little bucket and he can move water and he can hydrate

1940
01:29:20,760 --> 01:29:27,720
plants or he can put out fires just like that um and the legolas i'm gonna need you to grab

1941
01:29:27,720 --> 01:29:33,640
gimli so you can throw him at that thing unless he doesn't need to be thrown i don't know

1942
01:29:35,400 --> 01:29:40,200
oh it worked i'm not complaining um and then i believe it's gandalf's time to shine

1943
01:29:41,080 --> 01:29:47,400
very shortly make some one of these there's like a there is that's literally the very

1944
01:29:47,400 --> 01:29:55,320
iron we need it i love it here ginger yes bread only when you respond moment okay that's

1945
01:30:00,920 --> 01:30:05,720
i'm interested to see how peggle goes this week as well i just remember playing it

1946
01:30:06,120 --> 01:30:12,440
and where is gandalf gandalf can you do me a favor can you do this bit please thank you well the

1947
01:30:12,440 --> 01:30:18,600
magic is that was very weird to control i'm gonna be honest that was bizarre to control that was not

1948
01:30:18,600 --> 01:30:26,920
like put it here kind of physics that was different and throwing gimli with legolas is foul honestly

1949
01:30:26,920 --> 01:30:35,640
the please think of the lore implications you'll have to toss me imagine having your only special

1950
01:30:35,640 --> 01:30:41,800
in the world of magic with masters warriors is that you're holding a bucket at all times hey look

1951
01:30:41,800 --> 01:30:48,680
even the smallest positive impact is still positivity overall okay um

1952
01:30:53,560 --> 01:31:00,840
it still has good impact on i think i get an item here yeah i do we technically have collected

1953
01:31:00,840 --> 01:31:11,240
our first item but yeah we're about to do this little pathway but fly you literally the speedrun

1954
01:31:11,240 --> 01:31:23,240
record for portal window glitches is 14 minutes oh get a rest 14 minutes the development team must

1955
01:31:23,240 --> 01:31:30,840
be although actually i've watched the fallout new vegas development team watch someone's speedrun

1956
01:31:30,840 --> 01:31:36,360
and they were like amazed at what was going on because obviously they kind of understood a bit

1957
01:31:37,240 --> 01:31:44,120
what was going on behind the scenes with everything and um it was rather entertaining to watch

1958
01:31:45,000 --> 01:31:51,480
never caught a stream before this what you you like lego lord of the rings turning you on

1959
01:31:51,480 --> 01:32:00,040
yeah yeah you like all the facts i'm telling about the game yeah that's what you like what game was

1960
01:32:00,040 --> 01:32:04,600
this uh fallout new vegas the development team i don't know if you type it in if you type like

1961
01:32:04,600 --> 01:32:10,840
fallout new vegas dev team watches speedrun they were like talking about how they only had like

1962
01:32:10,840 --> 01:32:19,160
16 months to put this game together and like the budget was just like you know and then it ended

1963
01:32:19,160 --> 01:32:26,120
up being the most popular fallout game just because of everything they did now when you do the sequence

1964
01:32:26,120 --> 01:32:31,480
in the game you will be very tempted to swap off a character and think sam will climb up on his own

1965
01:32:31,480 --> 01:32:38,920
he won't don't fall for it don't fall for the bait okay oh lego this is the helmet on that i picked up

1966
01:32:40,920 --> 01:32:47,000
just like that shawnee the hall is crushed colfish there is i think i might be the only colfish

1967
01:32:47,000 --> 01:32:51,320
retriever at this point in time i don't know i'll need to look it up i've actually not looked to see

1968
01:32:51,320 --> 01:32:55,000
if there's like another check that's a colfish because it would be kind of cool if we both like

1969
01:32:55,000 --> 01:32:58,680
had a hidden thing going all right but i think i might be doing one i'm not sure

1970
01:33:05,400 --> 01:33:10,520
okay this part i'm getting nervous about because this is the most glitchiest part of the game

1971
01:33:10,520 --> 01:33:18,440
about to come out if we get past it glitchless i'll be happy um but the longer you play lego lord

1972
01:33:18,440 --> 01:33:25,320
of the rings the more instances are generated i know that sounds bizarre but the longer you

1973
01:33:25,320 --> 01:33:29,080
play it the more likely you're going to run into a problem or a glitch or whatever

1974
01:33:32,920 --> 01:33:39,080
oh i got shivers and i'm literally looking at a cube okay it means a lot to me it means a lot

1975
01:33:40,040 --> 01:33:43,480
lego balrog honestly they did amazing with the design

1976
01:33:47,480 --> 01:33:55,400
um so what made you go i'm gonna make pregnant ASMR i like shit posting okay and then i wanted

1977
01:33:55,400 --> 01:33:59,800
to be pregnant with the reeflings and then when i made it and i put the heartbeat in it and then

1978
01:33:59,800 --> 01:34:06,040
i put the muffled voice on it and then i put my stomach sounds in the game in the game in the

1979
01:34:06,040 --> 01:34:11,960
video and then i uploaded it with subtitles and then everyone clicked on it thinking i was going

1980
01:34:11,960 --> 01:34:16,600
to meme and it'd be a massive shit post but i actually put all my love and time into it okay

1981
01:34:16,600 --> 01:34:23,560
this is the most glitchiest part of the game i am praying we don't glitch out praying we don't

1982
01:34:23,560 --> 01:34:30,120
glitch out it's the most i have never had more issues with any scene in the game than this one

1983
01:34:30,680 --> 01:34:38,360
and the worst part is it's right at the end of the level there's like one thing we have to do

1984
01:34:38,360 --> 01:34:48,040
Frodo gang and then it's the really sad part of the movie where um we gandalf in it because they

1985
01:34:48,040 --> 01:34:55,880
think he's popped his wee bugs um but i'm praying it looks good it looks like we're not running into

1986
01:34:55,880 --> 01:35:03,080
the glitch it's the infinite dive glitch even when you dive um balrog or the sword do not get

1987
01:35:03,080 --> 01:35:09,560
any closer to you but we look we're looking good we're looking good we're looking good we're looking

1988
01:35:09,560 --> 01:35:23,640
good i think we're doing mighty fine so we just need to avoid as we attack i don't think this is

1989
01:35:23,640 --> 01:35:32,600
actually doing any damage to them we've just got one more of these to do copy them i literally is a

1990
01:35:32,600 --> 01:35:40,680
bottomless hole i get genuinely we only have to do it one more time come on game i believe in you

1991
01:35:40,680 --> 01:35:47,560
don't glitch out now or i'm gonna great the sword is getting closer okay good good and

1992
01:35:47,560 --> 01:35:55,880
then we're gonna dive for balrog please get closer i think we're okay i think we've okay

1993
01:35:55,880 --> 01:36:02,760
worst part of the game is officially over we're not gonna glitch out at this stage because we don't

1994
01:36:02,840 --> 01:36:07,720
have to do the dive sequence again we're just spamming away

1995
01:36:10,840 --> 01:36:12,600
surely copy i'm gonna be fine

1996
01:36:16,680 --> 01:36:26,680
whoa whoa whoa whoa you reverse your special kind of feature bird oh my i love that thank you my

1997
01:36:26,680 --> 01:36:31,000
mom calls me special too so did my teachers at one point as well

1998
01:36:34,680 --> 01:36:41,320
look i like what i like i like what i like is likely to go wow is it that likely to go to

1999
01:36:41,320 --> 01:36:46,760
i've played this game multiple times i've had issues with this scene the most this is the worst

2000
01:36:46,760 --> 01:36:54,440
scene okay but this this section does it so i've done it the balrog sequence is over the

2001
01:36:54,440 --> 01:37:00,360
likelihood of us experiencing major glitches or anything of that nature very very small now

2002
01:37:00,360 --> 01:37:05,800
incredibly small don't want to jinx it no come on now come on now don't want to jinx it but uh yeah

2003
01:37:05,800 --> 01:37:12,520
we're gonna we're gonna be alright we're gonna be alright and okay we need to get the reel up so we

2004
01:37:12,520 --> 01:37:20,200
can get the weans up uh what's that oh i think it's the treasure chest on the wall oh it is there's

2005
01:37:20,200 --> 01:37:25,400
just chilling right sure we'll we'll grab it while we're at it why not all right there we go so now

2006
01:37:25,400 --> 01:37:30,120
the wee ones can come up and then gimley just needs to smash the door open thank you reverie

2007
01:37:30,120 --> 01:37:35,880
famous last words the balrog fight was used as gal doll's intro into the weird lego crossover game

2008
01:37:36,680 --> 01:37:43,080
so i i'm an idiot and i mix up my lore about the game like all the fucking time right and i

2009
01:37:43,080 --> 01:37:49,240
couldn't remember what the actual recording movie lore was everyone is crying outside this mountain

2010
01:37:49,240 --> 01:37:55,080
over gandalf but what it was is they hadn't like done the scene so they were crying over nothing

2011
01:37:55,080 --> 01:37:59,160
basically they hadn't really met gandalf's character at all at this recording stage

2012
01:37:59,160 --> 01:38:05,080
because they tried to get all of the outdoor footage stuff done so in the movie they're all

2013
01:38:05,080 --> 01:38:10,360
greeting over gandalf and they've not even met them yet basically so don't tell me they weren't good

2014
01:38:10,360 --> 01:38:28,360
actors in the movie they were greeting over we don't want any orc it's like the same uh the

2015
01:38:28,360 --> 01:38:41,000
scene with um rider um or argon and uh the pub for the first time he was an emergency standing um

2016
01:38:44,040 --> 01:38:49,400
he was an emergency standing uh because their original person that was going to play argon

2017
01:38:49,400 --> 01:38:54,760
got yoinked because they did a few scenes with them and then peter jackson was like yeah this

2018
01:38:54,760 --> 01:39:00,440
isn't gonna work out so in the pub scene where he's like smoking his wee cigarette that's not him

2019
01:39:00,440 --> 01:39:07,560
and then when he does get revealed in the scene he's just being impromptued by like what the others

2020
01:39:07,560 --> 01:39:11,800
are doing type thing like they're actually not in the scene together why are you crying i don't know

2021
01:39:11,800 --> 01:39:18,520
who are you didn't that make ian mckellan because he wanted to interact with people yes in the hobbit

2022
01:39:19,160 --> 01:39:26,280
um because of the height difference instead of using practical stuff like they did in the first

2023
01:39:26,280 --> 01:39:32,680
movie they used like stunt doubles all of that he was literally in a room filled with green screens

2024
01:39:32,680 --> 01:39:38,840
talking to tennis balls with faces on it and he was like i can't do this um so peter jackson like

2025
01:39:38,840 --> 01:39:45,960
tried to cheer him up um like they pimped out his little studio caravan room thing like he put loads

2026
01:39:45,960 --> 01:39:52,440
of props in it to like cheer him up because he likes the elven props um it was just kind of one

2027
01:39:52,440 --> 01:39:57,880
of those like really unfortunate things where like ian mckellan he wants to act with other people

2028
01:39:57,880 --> 01:40:03,640
he's fantastic for the stage he's fantastic for socializing and it just felt so wrong for him to

2029
01:40:03,640 --> 01:40:12,680
be a room on his own like reading his lines to no one um and it just felt awful oh my god if that

2030
01:40:12,680 --> 01:40:21,000

2072
01:45:15,000 --> 01:45:20,360
freaking time because this one sucks if you don't see you need a mithril bow and arrow in order to

2106
01:49:08,600 --> 01:49:13,080
i still remember the xbox lord of the ring game that only covered till the helm state the fight

2107
01:49:13,080 --> 01:49:19,560
and the combat was so fun i have terrible news for the hobbit so i do want to play lego hobbit

2108
01:49:20,520 --> 01:49:29,800
for some reason it just ends they did the first two movies and then the game just ends in the

2109
01:49:29,800 --> 01:49:34,680
hobbit we are gonna play it because i do enjoy it but the third movie is just straight up not in the

2110
01:49:34,680 --> 01:49:39,880
video game no it's not dlc no the reason was never publicly released but i think it's obvious

2111
01:49:39,880 --> 01:49:46,040
warner brothers were being a bunch of fannies um i'll shank you now honestly there's a lego hobbit

2112
01:49:46,040 --> 01:49:52,120
to yes but it's definitely not as popular due to the nature of the medical emergency in that game

2113
01:49:53,080 --> 01:49:59,320
oh my god i am forgetting everything in this game uh uh uh what do i need to i don't know i don't

2114
01:49:59,320 --> 01:50:02,840
know i don't know i don't know what i need to i need to beat these up i'll beat these up right

2115
01:50:02,840 --> 01:50:10,680
now and look i won't right there's a fireplace okay that's good i need a torch perfect we're doing

2116
01:50:10,680 --> 01:50:16,360
it right this area you can't literally do nothing in until you get like the free play mode

2117
01:50:17,160 --> 01:50:24,920
that's part of it they couldn't get the license and it's all warner brothers and mass corporations

2118
01:50:24,920 --> 01:50:31,480
so you know what we say about the high table ruining it for everyone they do be ruining it

2119
01:50:32,040 --> 01:50:41,720
you're you're ruining it you're ruining it okay i'm gonna see if i can play the lord of the rings

2120
01:50:41,720 --> 01:50:47,800
game like that old ancient one i have never played it personally but everyone recommends it if you're

2121
01:50:47,800 --> 01:50:52,360
a lord of the rings fan so i think we're gonna play it for the first time i get nervous to play

2122
01:50:52,360 --> 01:50:55,720
a game for the first time though i don't know if i'm allowed to cheat to doodle and play like one

2123
01:50:55,720 --> 01:51:01,880
hour offline and then then be like yeah that's all good okay i've messed up because i didn't do it

2124
01:51:01,880 --> 01:51:11,880

they made me so cute and they literally gave me the option of what i wanted and i'm like bro i want

2138
01:52:27,480 --> 01:52:32,360
to work with you again so but you were like so professional for no reason like i gave you the

2139
01:52:32,360 --> 01:52:41,880
most unhinged commission and you were so professional like what the hell oh my there's no way up next

2140
01:52:41,880 --> 01:52:49,720
unburdening smart what's that is that where i put you inside me like on purpose i was just going to

2141
01:52:49,800 --> 01:52:54,440
do you go in my tummy there's an enemy that comes out from underneath here by the way it just

2142
01:52:54,440 --> 01:52:59,240
randomly attacks you whilst you're minding your own business if you go under that i'm just warning

2143
01:52:59,240 --> 01:53:06,520
you now don't be caught off guard because he always catches me off guard but we can skip them

2144
01:53:09,800 --> 01:53:13,720
you want to go back in the womb no i can put you in my tummy but i don't know how i can do

2145
01:53:13,720 --> 01:53:24,120
anything further like i'm unburdened okay aragon more like your smell alone because you're smelling

2146
01:53:24,120 --> 01:53:29,800
so aragon fucking thing is he can track stuff obviously because he's a hunter in that but you

2147
01:53:29,800 --> 01:53:36,760
need to like follow the stupid green thing around and it's such a busted system it's so busted like

2148
01:53:36,760 --> 01:53:40,920
it's literally telling me to walk on this damn statue like no motherfucker i can't walk on the

2149
01:53:40,920 --> 01:53:46,600
damn statue but then the more you like walk around in circles like the less the distance gets

2150
01:53:46,600 --> 01:53:55,480
type thing where is the rig it has taken barmy barmy shan't get it isn't it just more with extra

2154
01:54:18,120 --> 01:54:25,320
can do but there's some stuff i ain't got so you need to kill the guys on the pedestals in order

2155
01:54:25,320 --> 01:54:30,520
to progress i took me a very long time in my first playthrough to figure that out anyone that's on a

2156
01:54:30,520 --> 01:54:38,360
pedestal or like stationary get them gone and then you can progress birth and then unbirth to make

02:04:55,080 --> 02:05:01,720
perish as frodo don't get me wrong you can still perish real quick um but yeah if we check out the

2244
02:05:01,720 --> 02:05:11,160
map we are um we're currently coming up to the black swamp and then we're gonna make it to the

2245

2251
02:05:51,320 --> 02:05:56,120
golem the only time i've been influenced is by lord of the rings i just want a little farm or a

2252
02:05:56,120 --> 02:06:01,960
little community and we all like grow nice flowers and we all share our produce with each other so

2253
02:06:01,960 --> 02:06:09,160
we don't have to pay for basic living experiences and stuff i don't know very controversial i know

2254
02:06:09,160 --> 02:06:13,720
controversial very controversial so i won't i won't bring it up again i won't bring it up again

2255
02:06:15,640 --> 02:06:19,080
everyone wants to be a hobbit literally it's why i'm obsessed i'm like a little hobbit and

2256
02:06:20,040 --> 02:06:28,440
there's a map in lego um hobbit which i love so much because you get to go into the back garden

2257
02:06:28,440 --> 02:06:34,280
and bag end and i just want to sit out there in the back garden and enjoy bag ends for all we've got

2258
02:06:35,320 --> 02:06:44,600
so yandel this is the most annoying treasure to ever if you do not do this

2259
02:06:44,600 --> 02:06:52,120
stair sequence correctly you will be denied the treasure okay but moving items around in this

2260
02:06:52,120 --> 02:07:01,400
game with magic sucks okay as much as i like sucking on the willy right this sucks if you

2261
02:07:01,400 --> 02:07:10,360
don't do it right and it's so see how like sensitive and stuff is it is and it's so delayed right i'm

2262
02:07:10,360 --> 02:07:16,360
going to purposefully put it up there okay if i need to do this right easy eat nope see we're

2263
02:07:16,360 --> 02:07:21,960
fucked up just the john thank you for the 10 and do we stick our thing with glicks i like it

2265
02:07:33,400 --> 02:07:39,320

2266
02:07:39,320 --> 02:07:44,600
perfect okay there we go and we're gonna slot it oh it's tight it's tight is anyone got loop

2267
02:07:44,600 --> 02:07:49,960
it's tight holy go up and go no right okay we're moving the yellow one out the way a little bit

2268
02:07:49,960 --> 02:07:57,480
why would you not fit in please fit oh go down right hold on it may be easier to move that to the

2269
02:07:57,480 --> 02:08:12,200
side easy steady okay okay okay don't don't give up yet okay don't let mm-hmm mm-hmm okay um

2270
02:08:15,960 --> 02:08:22,520
okay yes okay we did it we don't ever have to do that again you can skip these height puzzles

2271
02:08:22,520 --> 02:08:28,280
by literally slapping two on top but we did it we did it okay and thank you for letting me

2272
02:08:28,280 --> 02:08:37,240
pop your your super chat cherry we did it we will never have to do that again okay it's an

2273
02:08:37,240 --> 02:08:42,280
absolute nightmare it took me so long to figure out what the last hidden item was in this game that

2274
02:08:42,280 --> 02:08:49,880
i couldn't find but i remember all the good and all the bad in this game i promise you i promise

2275
02:08:50,040 --> 02:08:56,360
i do i'm just i'm just that mlg pro sorry when other streamers are being top 500 in video games me

2276
02:08:56,360 --> 02:09:01,400
i'm sweating on lego lord of the rings you haven't you haven't worked a hard day in your life okay

2277
02:09:01,400 --> 02:09:08,120
soft hands brother soft hands streamer you ain't you ain't putting a seven hour shift on lego

2278
02:09:08,120 --> 02:09:14,120
lord of the rings i assure you that much you haven't gone against a balrog with perfect no hit okay

2279
02:09:14,120 --> 02:09:22,440
okay now this fight could be sped up a little bit that's my only developmental note it could

2280
02:09:22,440 --> 02:09:31,160
be sped up a bit we're gonna be here for a solid two minutes um but overall we will uh get through

2281
02:09:31,160 --> 02:09:36,600
it nice and easy shaft hands brother i love that meme you ain't worked a hard day in your life soft

2282
02:09:36,600 --> 02:09:40,600
hands brother and like their hands are like covered in dirt and they're eating their food without

2283
02:09:40,680 --> 02:09:45,240
washing them in that it's like a big old move big old brain rot mean if you're not into the

2284
02:09:45,240 --> 02:09:55,000
brain rot side things um so basically i against all odds as if the the camera isn't trying to

2285
02:09:55,000 --> 02:10:02,200
tell you that hey there's a thing here um we actually want to stand in the lightning now

2286
02:10:02,200 --> 02:10:06,920
i do want to assure you for those reeflings who uh might not be so um

2287
02:10:06,920 --> 02:10:15,400
um you know you may be uh a little you know just yourself uh a little bit too much of a

2288
02:10:15,400 --> 02:10:21,240
reefling do not play in lightning do not wear metallic items during a thunderstorm of that

2289
02:10:21,240 --> 02:10:27,480
nature um do not be a magnet if you will to the electricity is very dangerous okay i want the

2290
02:10:27,480 --> 02:10:34,360
best for you i want you to be safe all right i work 47 hours a day you got soft hands boy see

2291
02:10:34,360 --> 02:10:40,600
you know the meme okay again we walk in the lightning wherever it strikes here we go and

2292
02:10:40,600 --> 02:10:47,320
we press b and then we lift up the thing in for the legal piece that's on display but playing in

2293
02:10:47,320 --> 02:10:54,360
traffic is all right i don't know why that's the thing who needs to be told not to play in traffic

2294
02:10:54,360 --> 02:11:00,040
it's my question but then i discovered that scotland isn't like other countries where there's like a

2295
02:11:00,040 --> 02:11:06,600
park pretty much in every uh town village city uh district whatever you want to call it like there's

2296
02:11:06,600 --> 02:11:12,120
always one there i was so late on that jump and we didn't get hurt i don't know how um

2297
02:11:14,280 --> 02:11:22,200
but yeah so apparently parks aren't a thing everywhere universally who'd have fun that's

2298
02:11:22,200 --> 02:11:28,440
where to see where's it gonna be oh i pressed the wrong button embarrassing you didn't see that

2299
02:11:28,440 --> 02:11:36,120
i pressed x okay you must i'll i'll tell you everything let's go if you want me to be safe

2300
02:11:36,120 --> 02:11:43,800
from here make sure standing in lightning shocking behavior my cola was in the way again i'm sorry

2301
02:11:43,800 --> 02:11:50,200
it was a delayed reaction the cola was in the way the can of cola is getting put to my right i

2302
02:11:50,200 --> 02:11:53,640
repeat the can of cola is getting put to my right because it's taking too long for me to hit that

2303
02:11:53,640 --> 02:12:01,240
dang thing to make the joke funny the delay is what kills it okay fishy time fishy time

2304
02:12:02,040 --> 02:12:07,960
golems hungy we need to feed golem because we feed all the reeflings yes golems are reefling as

2305
02:12:07,960 --> 02:12:12,600
well just because he looks a bit different it doesn't mean he's you know and he's a wee bit

2306
02:12:12,600 --> 02:12:19,160
bad but you don't you don't necessarily have to you know get it perfect so what we do is we pick

2307
02:12:19,160 --> 02:12:25,880
up the fish and we throw it in the bucket and then it oh sorry hold hold on a minute and we throw it

2308
02:12:25,880 --> 02:12:31,560
in the bucket and then it low the weight of it actually lowers the wall now i promise you you're

2309
02:12:31,560 --> 02:12:37,480
not catching fish that are that heavy in real life unless it's like tuna or something uh wait

2310
02:12:37,480 --> 02:12:44,040
that shouldn't happen so we use sam to get up and then we beat these up so they release the

2311
02:12:44,040 --> 02:12:51,480
ladders and then that's already got the third fishing he's a model reefling our strongest

2312
02:12:51,480 --> 02:12:57,080
soldier our most feral soldier honestly i think if you beat up the bones you get an

2313
02:12:57,080 --> 02:13:03,560
a treasure possibly didn't beat up all the bones on the map oh that's one of four um as i said

2314
02:13:03,560 --> 02:13:10,520
sam now has a rope and if rhodo can now go in dark spaces with the magic fail we need sam to come

2315
02:13:10,520 --> 02:13:17,000
over so you do need to like work in tangent and unison with one another um especially for things

2316
02:13:17,000 --> 02:13:25,160
like this like Frodo uh sam can get stuck in the um he can get stuck in caves and stuff if you're

2317
02:13:25,160 --> 02:13:31,880
not careful which is a little bit annoying but it is what it is uh we can beat this up a piece of

2318
02:13:31,880 --> 02:13:37,080
desire so we'll go for it strongly giving our toughest battles to the strongest reeflings honestly

2319
02:13:37,400 --> 02:13:42,280
i'm just joining the first person to the level one hitless legals i've already been beating up

2320
02:13:42,280 --> 02:13:49,880
like so many i think uh the biggest danger to myself in video games is well for the type of

2321
02:13:49,880 --> 02:13:56,680
games that i play anyway it isn't the enemies it's me perishing off the map and like falling off the

2322
02:13:56,680 --> 02:14:08,280
map and stuff um because yeah i i don't know i just seem to be my biggest enemy when it comes to

2323
02:14:08,280 --> 02:14:15,000
games now we are gonna make a fire with sam so we do need to grab this piece so oh i just dropped

2324
02:14:15,000 --> 02:14:19,320
the fish please let me pick it back up again i hate when the game does that it gives me a heart attack

2325
02:14:20,280 --> 02:14:28,440
it gives me a heart attack you must hate platformers i am not good at them so i avoid them like i've

2326
02:14:28,440 --> 02:14:35,800
been very tactical in my game choices um when streaming but as i said blinks is the first

2327
02:14:35,800 --> 02:14:41,960
game that i've been like that was a terrible idea who picked that game because it was me it was me

2328
02:14:41,960 --> 02:14:50,760
um but yes i messed up with that but i try to pick games i know i'm gonna like or i have a

2329
02:14:50,760 --> 02:14:57,320
genuine interest in playing for the first time um but platformers to me are just like really

2330
02:14:57,320 --> 02:15:04,360
frustrating i didn't get it didn't get it i don't know why like so like the elden ring is one of

2331
02:15:04,360 --> 02:15:08,600
those games where i would never play on my own but because you guys have the ability to literally

2332
02:15:08,600 --> 02:15:12,600
carry me in stream snipe i have so much fun because i like being able to play games with

2333
02:15:12,600 --> 02:15:19,480
you um it just feels like so much better and like fun when like we get to do stuff together

2334
02:15:20,440 --> 02:15:28,840
um uh i'm still not sure what to do about fortnite metal pants i think we will end up playing it

2335
02:15:29,640 --> 02:15:38,040
but eddy's would be nice um eddy's would be nice so we need to get frodo to come up to do this thing

2336
02:15:38,040 --> 02:15:44,680
blinks tried is blinks or not platformer i don't think it's a platformer but it was a game

2337
02:15:45,400 --> 02:15:56,200
that is not for me yes let's beat this up so i think we can get the fourth one wherever it is

2338
02:15:56,200 --> 02:16:02,440
i'm not sure but it is frodo has to go up here into this bit because there's a little fishy in

2339
02:16:02,440 --> 02:16:09,720
that dark and then we got all the fishes and then we're on to the next part away see we got two

2340
02:16:09,720 --> 02:16:16,680
fishes each so sam has two i have to um crash bandicoot as a platformer and you enjoyed it i mean

2341
02:16:16,680 --> 02:16:30,040
it was relatively easy going around in circles okay let's make sure the game doesn't randomly

2342
02:16:30,120 --> 02:16:34,680
throw the fish halfway across the map and we have to get it again because i have to admit

2343
02:16:34,680 --> 02:16:38,680
this game is a little naughty for that if you have an item it might not auto lock on where

2344
02:16:38,680 --> 02:16:47,880
you're wanting to put it and i'm like um okay let's go wait a spiral platformer too senior

2345
02:16:47,880 --> 02:16:55,960
rage against is funny though i mean as long as you're enjoying it but i'm fucking raging in that

2346
02:16:55,960 --> 02:17:05,240
moment i'm raging and when i'm raging i feel like i get like become like such a moody demon

2347
02:17:05,240 --> 02:17:09,400
and i'm like no one wants to watch someone be raging at a video game like you know those games

2348
02:17:09,400 --> 02:17:15,240
that are like jump king oh my i could not even imagine how loud i'd be screaming at jump king

2349
02:17:15,240 --> 02:17:20,200
i don't know how people tolerate it i don't know how they enjoy it i don't know what enjoyment you

2350
02:17:20,200 --> 02:17:30,040
get out of it because like the endorphin drop that i would get in the mood swings i would get

2351
02:17:30,040 --> 02:17:35,880
playing a game like that like it's just punishing i don't know how anyone has the enjoyment of

2352
02:17:35,880 --> 02:17:45,960
tolerance etc for it a very small full of rage anger literally you know what one how dare you two

2353
02:17:45,960 --> 02:17:53,640
that's me uh oh we're getting a free treasure chest i'm not arguing i'm not arguing

2354
02:18:01,000 --> 02:18:06,200
okay free treasure chest right first things first let's speak golem we give him one fishy

2355
02:18:06,200 --> 02:18:14,600
and then i think he attacks us actually he does right okay we need to like i think he attacks sam

2356
02:18:15,240 --> 02:18:16,760
and then we need to beat him up or something

2357
02:18:19,000 --> 02:18:23,320
wait what was that yeah that okay that was it and then we beat him up and then that's one hp

2358
02:18:23,320 --> 02:18:27,720
off of them okay oh and we beat up sam while we're at it as well sorry he deserved it he's asking for

2359
02:18:29,560 --> 02:18:33,400
they're such a cute image rage i feel like you guys will get scared when we want to rage you're

2360
02:18:33,400 --> 02:18:40,600
like oh my god what's wrong with her and i'm just like hey it's 5 am in the morning

2361
02:18:40,840 --> 02:18:47,000
okay we are gonna put a fishing rod together and we just need to combine it

2362
02:18:47,640 --> 02:18:53,720
a rope and a hook what did you call me okay we don't have the last part yeah i think we need to

2363
02:18:53,720 --> 02:19:03,720
climb up here or something can we make a little staircase oh uh wait what how'd i go oh sometimes

2364
02:19:03,720 --> 02:19:09,080
the easiest solution is the the obvious you know instead of making things off we're gonna say

2365
02:19:09,160 --> 02:19:15,960
the fishing rods on Frodo though okay this is where i could fart on the game so i have the stick

2366
02:19:15,960 --> 02:19:20,840
that Frodo needs okay so i need to drop it and make sure it doesn't despawn or go halfway across

2367
02:19:20,840 --> 02:19:26,920
the map hey that this fishing rod does actually account for an item which is pretty cool i think

2368
02:19:26,920 --> 02:19:34,120
it's pretty cool anyway but we're cooking and catching a fish don't make Johnny angry you

2369
02:19:34,120 --> 02:19:40,040
wouldn't like when she's angry it looks really so he's gonna fish that up i'm gonna throw it to

2370
02:19:40,040 --> 02:19:46,840
little Gordon um and i'm gonna get do the rope thing i'll get attacked and then some

2371
02:19:46,840 --> 02:19:55,560
hey Frodo will save us and then that's it this sequence is done he's gonna get attacked

2372
02:19:56,520 --> 02:20:03,160
and then we save we swoop in and save the day boom boom and then we do the fishing thing again

2373
02:20:03,160 --> 02:20:10,600
i'm like 99 percent yeah that's literally the exact same thing i do like this i think uh

2374
02:20:10,600 --> 02:20:15,240
because it's enjoyable although the game looks like a pixel on the wall back there i don't know

2375
02:20:15,240 --> 02:20:25,320
if it's because it's nighttime go go go i want to witness the rage live what you want a rage

2376
02:20:25,400 --> 02:20:30,600
stream i don't know if i could mentally prepare to rage on stream

2377
02:20:35,000 --> 02:20:39,160
you've seen it before haven't you haven't you go

2378

2379
02:20:53,320 --> 02:21:00,920
i i don't want to upset anyone but my house has been declining and i don't think i can

2380
02:21:00,920 --> 02:21:06,040
have any alcohol at the minute until it improves because i seem to have like faster heartbeat

2381
02:21:06,040 --> 02:21:12,680
when i drink alcohol and stuff so no drunk stream from me anytime soon possibly from the girls though

2382
02:21:12,680 --> 02:21:14,440

2425
02:26:15,480 --> 02:26:17,560

because what's on here oh hey i care no please ramble more okay if you like the ramble and

02:26:44,680 --> 02:26:51,800
of fruit back in my tummy again um because i drink uh these like fruit blended up fruit drinks which

2430
02:26:51,800 --> 02:26:59,720
i think really help and all that um work is born as hell right now right yeah how do we space up

2431
02:26:59,720 --> 02:27:06,760
someone that wait can you see the screen if you're at work right now or can i just pretend like stuff

2432
02:27:06,760 --> 02:27:11,720
has happened oh my god did you see oh my god oh my god oh you missed it you missed it because

2433
02:27:11,720 --> 02:27:15,160
you were at work and you weren't looking at the screen because you're busy having to look elsewhere

2434
02:27:15,160 --> 02:27:19,880
oh i'm so sorry you missed that oh no it won't work on the rewind sorry it's not going to work on

2435
02:27:19,880 --> 02:27:30,760
the rewind you missed how evil is that that's so evil why why really i'm an evil siren i've

2436
02:27:30,760 --> 02:27:38,280
proved that i'm immediately peeking see see it works it's only being a little shit literally

2437
02:27:41,080 --> 02:27:47,480
can't overstate how much soup is a lifesaver made a massive amount of fortnight ago and froze

2438
02:27:47,480 --> 02:27:52,920
ended up having a health scare last week that left me very stressed and short on time that soup

2439
02:27:52,920 --> 02:28:01,560
literally kept me alive for a week also smooth or oh thank you for that i'm glad to hear that you're

2440
02:28:01,560 --> 02:28:06,760
feeling a bit better i think i'm probably in your shoes right now um oh my god we're literally

2441
02:28:07,400 --> 02:28:11,480
you had a health scare i had a health scare we should like make it or something i don't know

2442
02:28:12,760 --> 02:28:19,640
um i'm going to say something controversial okay so don't cancel me but chunky soup is where it's at

2443
02:28:19,640 --> 02:28:26,680
i want to bite that liquid okay i want to take a nice bite into a juicy chunky yummy carrot okay

2444
02:28:27,640 --> 02:28:34,760
i want to feel them legumes slop down my throat okay uh and then i want nice white crusty bread on

2445
02:28:34,760 --> 02:28:45,240
the side what more could i ask for okay straining nor no why would you want smooth soup how evil

2446
02:28:45,240 --> 02:28:52,920
are you lore wise absolutely despicable i want to destroy all of humanity but well i say unfortunately

2447
02:28:52,920 --> 02:28:59,400
lore wise not the best but um other than that um

2448
02:29:02,600 --> 02:29:09,160
other than that the reeflings helped me and i have seen the light now that i have received

2449
02:29:09,160 --> 02:29:18,200
a good inking right this is why we've muted this this dragon screams this entirety like of the entire

2450
02:29:18,200 --> 02:29:26,520
sequence it is absolutely awful this ring race this dragon it screams the entire time and it's so loud

2451
02:29:26,520 --> 02:29:31,560
so i have put down the in-game volume but i will put it up next level because this is the only level

2452
02:29:31,560 --> 02:29:38,200
that has this issue it is so aggravating especially when you're trying to do a hundred percent completion

2453
02:29:39,240 --> 02:29:48,200
oh my goodness golly it is so loud it is so loud i want to grab that no no no that's for sam that's

2454
02:29:48,200 --> 02:29:55,160
for sam sam yep sam do your thing me do this sweet i'm just a plant please leave me alone

2455
02:29:57,240 --> 02:30:04,200
the nascar looks scuffed i mean they did all right with what they had but i'll give you more ink if

2456
02:30:04,200 --> 02:30:10,440
you want some real entry did you just die instantly yes it takes all of your health in one go you do

2457
02:30:10,440 --> 02:30:20,040
not survive you lose all your weak points that you try so hard to gather um is a bit frustrating

2458
02:30:21,560 --> 02:30:26,760
honestly if you want to like get real Frodo don't do that again i'm scared

2459
02:30:27,160 --> 02:30:32,120
you're doing thank you anonymous and thank you in case i'm not shingin it

2460
02:30:34,360 --> 02:30:37,960
is the main attack tactic of the dragon a silent dragon the weak one

2461
02:30:38,840 --> 02:30:43,080
i might just fill the millets about he looks so chonky he a chonky mo

2462
02:30:43,640 --> 02:30:45,640
um

2463
02:30:49,880 --> 02:30:53,240
almost there we're almost there

2464
02:30:55,160 --> 02:31:00,280
again you need to like literally tell them to go in these or else they won't and they'll

2465
02:31:00,280 --> 02:31:05,640
perish themselves and it's like please ai work with me here i'm trying my hardest work with you here

2466
02:31:05,720 --> 02:31:15,320
it's the best invincibility effect i've ever oh okay this is the problem if you mess up that

2467
02:31:15,320 --> 02:31:21,240
sequence and do it too early he has to like come back and do it all over again bra i got too excited

2468
02:31:21,240 --> 02:31:26,840
okay i got too excited i was premature in my movements we've been we've had this conversation

2469
02:31:26,840 --> 02:31:34,600
before one in three men okay it's fine it's natural but i'm gonna grab this coin because uh

2470
02:31:35,800 --> 02:31:44,360
we are needing okay they can both hide in here both sam and brodo sam just needs to come under

2471
02:31:44,360 --> 02:31:52,120
okay that's all good that's all good oh is the bush timed no no i moved out of the bush too quickly

2472
02:31:56,440 --> 02:32:03,800
why does the water change when golem goes through it is he pooping no it's a marsh it's a bog

2473
02:32:04,760 --> 02:32:10,760
so the sediment on the bottom of the i know you're just making a joke sorry sorry i'm literally

2474
02:32:10,760 --> 02:32:15,400
like a mother when you tell like your mama joke and then she like turns it into a lesson randomly

2475
02:32:16,680 --> 02:32:22,600
i'm so sorry i'm like randomly turning it into a lesson i'm like so the sediment stays at the

2476
02:32:22,600 --> 02:32:29,160
bottom of the bog it's why like a lot of preserved um historical things are because where the where am i

2477
02:32:29,160 --> 02:32:39,320
trying to go oh sam it's the reason why a preservation in a bog because it doesn't get

2478
02:32:39,320 --> 02:32:44,360
stirred up or anything like that it's actually really fascinating like how we've got preserved

2479
02:32:44,360 --> 02:32:50,120
there was i can't remember there was a girl that was pulled out of a bog like 100 years ago and

2480
02:32:50,120 --> 02:32:55,480
they legit thought she popped her clogs maybe 200 years ago max from when she was discovered

2481
02:32:55,480 --> 02:33:02,440
and it was like no she is like preserved like a thousand year old plus i can't remember i might

2482
02:33:02,440 --> 02:33:08,120
have been swedish maybe i don't know there's a lot of discoveries like in scotland as well we have

2483
02:33:08,120 --> 02:33:14,840
quite quite a few bogs um because of the climate and all that jazz it is faster to move through

2484
02:33:14,840 --> 02:33:22,120
this via jumping um rather than weeding through the the bog honestly lessons with strony and random

2485
02:33:22,120 --> 02:33:32,760
things you know it's always a good time okay so mameco did that break i hide like that sam goes

2486
02:33:32,760 --> 02:33:37,240
in here and then i go in frodo because sam won't jump out but for some reason frodo will keep

2487
02:33:38,200 --> 02:33:43,480
changing i don't know why it's just don't don't question the ai the ai's a bit still silly in

2488
02:33:43,480 --> 02:33:50,120
this one there's a lot of bog bodies in ireland too yeah yeah because of the the scottish climate

2489
02:33:50,200 --> 02:33:54,840
you hit 19 000 oh okay now are we

2490
02:33:57,400 --> 02:34:00,680
i don't i don't even know what to say about the asmar debt i'm gonna be honest chief

2491
02:34:00,680 --> 02:34:05,160
i don't even know what to say i don't even know what to say soon that's what i'm gonna say you know

2492
02:34:05,160 --> 02:34:09,880

2493
02:34:10,760 --> 02:34:16,760
i am i know i'm in debt i know i'm in debt to you i'm gonna say soon okay i'm gonna say soon

2494
02:34:17,000 --> 02:34:21,880
what do you mean the pregnancy asmar threw me ahead a couple of hundred subscribers

2495
02:34:22,680 --> 02:34:24,120
crazy crazy

2496
02:34:27,480 --> 02:34:33,240
okay we did it we did it i'm happy to listen to whatever you say because my dad's Scottish as

2497
02:34:33,240 --> 02:34:39,560
well and but i lost his accent oh i was worried if i would lose my accent coming to australia

2498
02:34:39,560 --> 02:34:46,840
well um no that certainly did not happen i was embedded in me i can't change it and especially

2499
02:34:46,840 --> 02:34:52,600
the australian accents were really hard to mimic been here like two years or something now quite

2500
02:34:52,600 --> 02:35:07,800
a while now uh yeah the um the um the what the what um it's too hard the only thing i can do is the

2501
02:35:07,800 --> 02:35:14,360
news channel and it's it's like if anything it's a parody of the australian accent like

2502
02:35:15,240 --> 02:35:22,680
and on tonight's news down from down under like it's so bad it's so bad if you lose your accent

2503
02:35:22,680 --> 02:35:28,200
it's so ogre well the only thing that might happen is it would mash a bit with ozzy but i

2504
02:35:28,200 --> 02:35:35,320
can't imagine it like i can't imagine how an ozzy would say like dinny canny will need like i can't

2505
02:35:35,320 --> 02:35:41,080
yeah i just can't imagine this this thing and i've actually been introducing my accent slightly

2506
02:35:41,080 --> 02:35:49,880
more on streams i've been a little bit naughty and not being very not being not using slang i've

2507
02:35:49,880 --> 02:35:56,600
been using it a wee bit more and because i'm turning you scottish with me one way or another

2508
02:35:57,480 --> 02:36:00,360
either with consent or without it doesn't matter when it comes

2509
02:36:05,800 --> 02:36:13,640
scottish with an ozzy accent combo would be wild it would be pretty right there slowly conditioning

2651
02:52:36,840 --> 02:52:41,320
reflings are safer and stronger nothing to worry about maybe turn the tizm off a bit

2652
02:52:42,360 --> 02:52:48,520
i'm i got the right sprinkle that lets me like push through stuff that others might not be able

2653
02:52:48,520 --> 02:52:54,840

2654
02:52:56,040 --> 02:52:58,600

2655
02:53:00,600 --> 02:53:02,600

2680
02:55:45,560 --> 02:55:48,280
that is why you also want to get off gandalf when that happens

2681
02:55:49,880 --> 02:55:55,880
fun fact throughout all the films are going were born mere spraysters through them yeah his costume

2682
02:55:55,880 --> 02:56:05,160
gets like um oh yeah there's there's hidden purple studs in those rooms the enemies come out

2683
02:56:06,120 --> 02:56:10,840
this is the first time we've had true adventurer as well we're in the second game and it's the

2684
02:56:10,840 --> 02:56:16,440
first time it's happened right wallop him he'll do the run around then you need to come gandalf

2685
02:56:16,440 --> 02:56:24,600
if gandalf would like to stay alive and then fuck you and then exercise the shit out him

2686
02:56:24,600 --> 02:56:30,840
and then now he's healthy again we did it i'm gonna need you to suck the saruman out oh no

2687
02:56:30,920 --> 02:56:40,680
strongy help me sermons taking over my tentacle help help oh no i'm gonna do what we're gonna do

2688
02:56:49,160 --> 02:56:50,840
he would have lost if it was fun

2689
02:56:54,040 --> 02:56:59,240
when patreon oh you want that plot in patreon that's which and no i'm not putting lord of the rings

2690
02:56:59,240 --> 02:57:09,240
fucking inspired audio i mean i could i'd rather watch the version of the asus

2691
02:57:14,200 --> 02:57:20,360
i call upon the men of rohan open war is upon you i know what it is you want on me

2692
02:57:20,360 --> 02:57:22,840
but i will not bring further death to my people

2693
02:57:23,240 --> 02:57:24,440
hmm

2694
02:57:31,960 --> 02:57:35,880
he like literally what the fuck bro we just saved you and you're saying

2695
02:57:37,640 --> 02:57:42,840
your girlfriend leads me to lord of the rings by the fire honestly i don't know if i have

2696
02:57:42,840 --> 02:57:49,560
the lungs for that and i can't read properly as well i don't know maybe i could do it i wouldn't

2697
02:57:49,560 --> 02:57:55,000
actually mind that and then i'll timestamp it so you've got all the chapters then we can read it

2698
02:57:55,000 --> 02:58:00,280
together for the first time because then i'll literally be like oh i didn't know that i didn't

2699
02:58:00,280 --> 02:58:06,680
literally every page is me going i didn't know that oh my god that's so cool oh so that's how

2700
02:58:06,680 --> 02:58:11,560
they did it in the movie but they got it from the suite and because apparently ganda oh sorry

2701
02:58:11,560 --> 02:58:16,200
let me on the horse um apparently gandalf was like constantly looking at the actual book for

2702
02:58:16,200 --> 02:58:22,920
reference um you want to go lego last for this one because he can snipe the enemies off the horses

2703
02:58:22,920 --> 02:58:30,920
wherever the enemies are once they spawn it again um like you don't you can get do you oh okay i guess

2704
02:58:30,920 --> 02:58:37,720
i just don't okay no it's fine i just want you to hurt the enemies no he just you're are you okay

2705
02:58:37,720 --> 02:58:50,280
legolas legolas legolas can you aim mother legolas hello okay one you suck two i'm going on freaking

2706
02:58:50,280 --> 02:58:56,840
aragon what was that where's the enemy you you're first right no you're first okay there we go okay

2707
02:58:56,840 --> 02:59:00,440
we're just sticking with aragon because i don't know why legolas doesn't have aimbot right now

2708
02:59:00,680 --> 02:59:08,520
maybe uh maybe next uh because we've had the instance open for quite a while we may be running

2709
02:59:08,520 --> 02:59:16,680
into a few little buggy wuggies but it's okay let's just try our best try our best with what we

2710
02:59:16,680 --> 02:59:20,680
got i saw that enemy get back here you be funny i know i've got you talking

2711
02:59:20,680 --> 02:59:31,320
um obviously there's a lot to do in this area um no one is contesting lord of the ring ASMR

2712
02:59:31,320 --> 02:59:37,720
be wrong it sounds weird i mean the books are double yeah but if i read the books for the first

2713
02:59:37,720 --> 02:59:45,640
time i'd constantly be i've got yoy put me down geez um i'd constantly be like oh that's so cool

2714
02:59:45,640 --> 02:59:52,200
how they did this i ain't ready like i know about the characters like tom bombadil and all that

2715
02:59:53,000 --> 02:59:58,040
and like i understand why they made a few choices not to put certain stuff in like obviously tom

2716
02:59:58,040 --> 03:00:03,000
bombadil is just too to put in the movie so i literally just saw you yeah freaking get back

2717
03:00:03,000 --> 03:00:07,560
here why are you running halfway across the map hypnotizing you to read the

2718
03:00:18,200 --> 03:00:22,360
mean not suck

2719
03:00:33,320 --> 03:00:35,000
you're

2720
03:00:42,440 --> 03:00:44,200
the little lego break apart then

2721
03:00:48,440 --> 03:00:53,640
it's one of the points in my to-do list i know but it's definitely something i'll do the end so

2722
03:00:53,640 --> 03:00:55,240
i don't plan on doing it anytime soon

2723
03:00:58,360 --> 03:01:05,000
get a load of this oh brother this guy thanks

2724
03:01:07,320 --> 03:01:14,680
well we're unlocking more people as well we now have gandalf way we can buy more characters on the

2725
03:01:14,680 --> 03:01:18,200
pod and the map which is good

2726
03:01:21,640 --> 03:01:23,080
and we made it this time

2727
03:01:27,080 --> 03:01:34,120
with only 30 000 studs but we're almost half a millionaire maybe we're quarter of a millionaire

2728
03:01:34,120 --> 03:01:41,640
but we're not half of them and we get too miss real for doing that one oh we're just two we're

2729
03:01:41,640 --> 03:01:48,760
actually just anything i forgot how many playable characters are in the game yes they also do a few

2730
03:01:48,760 --> 03:01:54,200
outfit one which i think is cheesy do the one if the outfit doesn't bring anything different

2731
03:01:55,080 --> 03:01:56,360
right we're about to do helm speak

2732
03:01:58,360 --> 03:02:10,200
who's ready for helm seed we have to protect our people of rohan and the orcs are coming at

2733
03:02:10,200 --> 03:02:21,080
night we ought to try our best to defend and then something happened in the middle of the night

2734
03:02:21,080 --> 03:02:31,960
i can't quite remember then we won the battle battle of helm steve we won it easy peasy peasy

2735
03:02:31,960 --> 03:02:36,840
battle of helmsd so few of you have returned

2736
03:02:39,000 --> 03:02:44,120
and similarly i remember my dad had me sit down and watch the whole trilogy when i was alive

2737
03:02:44,120 --> 03:02:51,080
but i fell asleep so quickly and everything fell so they think are gone perish they have no idea

2738
03:02:51,080 --> 03:02:57,480
oh well there you go they really cut down this plot real quick he already back

2739
03:02:57,480 --> 03:03:09,720
all eyes and god is indeed how many and right to ruin 10 000 you make a parody now it is an army

2740
03:03:09,720 --> 03:03:18,360
bred for a single vote to destroy the world of men let them come i want every man i want to be their

2741
03:03:18,360 --> 03:03:26,280
arms it's too easy get the women and children into the cave you'll get your time don't worry you'll

2742
03:03:26,280 --> 03:03:39,960
get you'll get your arc we promise and then the behind the scenes are just like is it myory

2743
03:03:39,960 --> 03:03:49,400
people myory because they're like so big naturally they all became ira kai like in the behind the

2744
03:03:49,400 --> 03:03:54,360
scenes and all the female horse riders sorry all the horse riders in the movies were actually female

2745
03:03:54,360 --> 03:03:58,920
because they're lighter for the horses to carry all the accessories and stuff as well

2746
03:04:00,840 --> 03:04:11,000
oh my god the elves are actually helping not lifelong you know differences being cast aside

2747
03:04:11,000 --> 03:04:18,520
defeat the same enemy i love it i love it i love when when feuds get buried under to defeat a big

2748
03:04:19,320 --> 03:04:24,600
i'm an absolute select for a plot like that i'm sorry it's just the best thing ever it's like

2749
03:04:24,600 --> 03:04:31,720
when two enemies have to come together to defeat an evil or boss um that's why john wick failed so

2750
03:04:31,720 --> 03:04:40,600
badly um he had a great time listening to the stream i work but i must go away and your episodes

2751
03:04:40,680 --> 03:04:44,360
of dnd dropped have fun listening

2752
03:04:49,560 --> 03:04:59,080
okay what's going on i have a crank i have a gemily i have a lego last to shoot stuff okay let's go

2753
03:04:59,080 --> 03:05:06,760
lego last to shoot that target so i can see it okay you know what i'll go f myself then for even

2754
03:05:07,400 --> 03:05:09,880
thinking i stood a chance truly

2755
03:05:18,040 --> 03:05:21,160
any of you's getting hungy should we get a quick break

2756
03:05:22,120 --> 03:05:24,600
actually how many more levels do i have to go

2757
03:05:26,680 --> 03:05:33,240
i might be a cheeky sod and ask for a refuel and get some chicken pie in the

2758
03:05:37,000 --> 03:05:45,480
oh i need gimme up here what is going on i don't know why you only keep

2759
03:05:47,800 --> 03:05:53,480
that rather strange i just made a bit more tea right now okay we're all think we're on the same wavelength

2760
03:05:55,400 --> 03:06:01,720
nutrition time thank you tiny spany for the super chat i am not here today i'm doing absolutely

2761
03:06:01,720 --> 03:06:05,880
terrible so i like to do like the unwritten rule of being a streamer which is literally

2762
03:06:05,880 --> 03:06:10,520
safe people saying as they do i don't know why i'm struggling too much today i'm having a stroke

2763
03:06:11,800 --> 03:06:18,680
what do you mean only having four hours is like is unacceptable okay throw him up as well i guess

2764
03:06:18,680 --> 03:06:26,840
you're slightly less than halfway through we're doing it i'll give you a different type of pie how

2765
03:06:26,840 --> 03:06:36,280
dare you forever strong you should rest i literally took my sleep medication yesterday

2766
03:06:36,280 --> 03:06:41,480
and i had a nap and i'm like the body just give me eight hours i'm so exhausted

2767
03:06:43,000 --> 03:06:50,120
but i can't use the sleep medicine anymore for a while because it's not like you can't rely on it

2768
03:06:51,080 --> 03:06:57,000
and so i'm a bit up shit creek for the next few days if i don't naturally go to sleep

2769
03:06:58,120 --> 03:07:02,360
and so it is what do you do

2770
03:07:06,040 --> 03:07:09,720
i mean i'll sleep well after you know we do a year of streaming

2771
03:07:10,920 --> 03:07:17,320
i'll sleep i'll sleep well when i get my first stream break i bet you i'll be so used to waking

2772
03:07:17,320 --> 03:07:21,960
up that i actually can't enjoy the day off and end up just coming back on the phone i'll end up

2773
03:07:21,960 --> 03:07:27,800
doing a pop-up stream because i'd be like it's so weird not streaming every single day um i'm very

2774
03:07:27,800 --> 03:07:38,920
excited because i get to put my montage together um of my uh month two of streams um we get to put

2775
03:07:38,920 --> 03:07:45,080
that together and then i get to have this fun we're scambling when you need them you shouldn't

2776
03:07:45,080 --> 03:07:52,760
rely on it in the first place it's just uh there's just so my body keeps trying to enter a deep

2777
03:07:52,760 --> 03:07:58,760
sleep right before stream and i'm trying to artificially pull it back a couple hours and it's

2778
03:07:58,760 --> 03:08:04,520
just failing like i got six i got seven hours of sleep the other day i was fucking over that moon

2779
03:08:04,520 --> 03:08:09,960
like sorry i had that base i don't i can't remember what day it was honestly the days are

2780
03:08:09,960 --> 03:08:25,560
starting to blend together blend to get a

2781
03:08:31,000 --> 03:08:38,280
no worries don't worry be happy like as i said i get really fun stream

2782
03:08:39,000 --> 03:08:46,040
whoa not like that hold on a minute hold on a minute we're on the blue side yeah um i do get like

2783
03:08:46,040 --> 03:08:52,040
i just don't feel stressed and i have a good time but as soon as i hit that end broadcast

2784
03:08:52,920 --> 03:08:57,400
oh i'm really just not perished it bro i need to throw gimley please stop

2785
03:08:59,240 --> 03:09:02,520

2786
03:09:03,240 --> 03:09:06,760
and then okay that was actually a good achievement name i'll give him that

2787
03:09:08,200 --> 03:09:15,480
and then gimley you're the last one here and we did damn right you did you could do it in secret

2788
03:09:15,480 --> 03:09:18,680
i don't know i feel like it'd be obvious because i'd just stop talking everyone'd be like that

2789
03:09:18,680 --> 03:09:23,640
strange this one he's not talking anymore this is all you can conjure saruman oh don't say that you

illiterately he's mental oh wait no that can't be berserker doesn't this guy blow himself up

2792
03:09:45,560 --> 03:09:46,360
i can't remember

2793
03:09:47,160 --> 03:09:49,160

2797
03:10:11,560 --> 03:10:15,080
uh right what do i need to do here

2798
03:10:17,640 --> 03:10:22,760
is there a secret behind this wall or is this another mission yeah okay sorry there's another

2799
03:10:22,760 --> 03:10:27,480
mission where there's a secret behind the wall uh i have no idea what i'm supposed to do

2800
03:10:28,200 --> 03:10:32,520
where's gimley oh you're literally i couldn't even see him i assume this is you

2802
03:10:41,240 --> 03:10:45,720
and then legolas jumped up the shield the skateboards actually it's a surfboard moment

2803
03:10:45,720 --> 03:10:51,400
all over again what or who is this is that legolas moment

2804
03:10:56,120 --> 03:10:59,400
and then push this and then they can all jump up and then

2805
03:11:00,120 --> 03:11:07,480
gimley will smash the stone and then we'll progress to the next section because

2806
03:11:07,480 --> 03:11:13,080
they actually put it in game that y'all have to toss me oh it's not here sorry it's the next bit

2807
03:11:13,080 --> 03:11:18,920
they actually put it in game are you ready are you ready are you ready

2808
03:11:19,400 --> 03:11:20,920
adrenaline is pumping

2809
03:11:24,840 --> 03:11:30,520
i can hit petal falling from a tree for 300 paces all those so legolas i cannot hit an

2810
03:11:32,120 --> 03:11:35,400
point blank no one in his way because my bow's a little bit slippery

2811
03:11:38,920 --> 03:11:40,200
shiver me timber

2812
03:11:48,920 --> 03:11:49,880
it's a long way

2813
03:12:02,200 --> 03:12:07,080
okay there is a wee thing down here you can grab without having to do anything in particular

2814
03:12:07,800 --> 03:12:13,160
and but there's a golem wall there obviously we don't have them unlocked but ready

2815
03:12:13,400 --> 03:12:13,880
me

2816
03:12:15,720 --> 03:12:20,120
then we beat them up beat them up beat them up beat them up shoot them up shoot them up

2817
03:12:22,200 --> 03:12:24,840
make them regret it make it hurt make it hurt baby make it hurt

2818
03:12:25,960 --> 03:12:30,120
make them regret spawning make them regret spawning yes my house

2819
03:12:30,920 --> 03:12:35,880
my rules okay we're gonna patch up the door real quick you know the one any the one any intruders

2820
03:12:36,680 --> 03:12:38,760
they made indiana jones lego they did

2821
03:12:40,200 --> 03:12:45,320
i played the first one because my dad got me it because he knew i like lego star wars

2822
03:12:45,320 --> 03:12:49,880
but the only reason i like lego star wars is because i like lego star wars you know what i mean

2823
03:12:49,880 --> 03:12:54,040
like that's why i like it so much and like the reason i like lego lord is it rings so much and

2824
03:12:55,720 --> 03:12:59,480
i don't need i need some tails put on the floor where do they come from

2825
03:13:00,520 --> 03:13:05,000
where did they go where did they come from cotton i don't know where the things come from

2826
03:13:05,960 --> 03:13:11,560
oh it's by the ladders sorry it's really obvious it's the ladders

2827
03:13:12,680 --> 03:13:18,520
and i miss every single shot because that's why we might hold on let me aim for him goodbye

2828
03:13:18,520 --> 03:13:22,440
thank you and then there's gonna be a new one that pops up so we're just gonna aim

2829
03:13:24,600 --> 03:13:24,840
boom

2830
03:13:27,320 --> 03:13:28,040
will be another one

2831
03:13:29,000 --> 03:13:33,000
boom

2832
03:13:35,560 --> 03:13:37,160
i like the service too when i was a little bit

2833
03:13:39,320 --> 03:13:46,760
they made a pirate so early they did a harry potter now i'd like the harry potter if it was

2834
03:13:46,760 --> 03:13:53,240
all one continuation but it's not as split into two games and i can't be arsed with that

2835
03:13:53,880 --> 03:13:58,920
although i actually wanted to give that like oh no it's not like the harry potter game a shot

2836
03:13:58,920 --> 03:14:04,360
it got rated so highly and i've still not played it i've not seen any footage or gameplay but it

2837
03:14:04,360 --> 03:14:09,000
got rated really highly and i don't know if it's a good game or if it's just the game that got

2838
03:14:09,720 --> 03:14:13,720
rated highly because it's harry potter because it's like a loved franchise type thing

2839
03:14:14,840 --> 03:14:19,240
these are the questions i have if i will know the truth to soon tm

2840
03:14:19,240 --> 03:14:22,200
um what's why

2841
03:14:23,000 --> 03:14:28,280
oh i'm to do something down here hold on i'm to build something oh platform to get them up okay i

2842
03:14:28,280 --> 03:14:37,240
understand um harry potter one to four is decent five to seven is pretty near

2843
03:14:37,240 --> 03:14:39,240
um

2844
03:14:42,040 --> 03:14:44,760
he's only twitching because my axis is fine

2845
03:14:46,920 --> 03:14:51,240
you can build an rtd to joy and not get crushed by a rock and give your reward i

2846
03:14:51,960 --> 03:14:56,840
don't even recall that i've never hundred percent in star wars before but i want to do that i was

2847
03:14:56,840 --> 03:15:03,320
going to do it on me for the fortress is taken that's quite a while away to plan a stream it is over

2848
03:15:04,200 --> 03:15:09,160
what can men do against such reckless hate why did my track and get lost i'm literally staring

2849
03:15:09,160 --> 03:15:13,000
at my right out why did you do that don't do that again i'm going to recalibrate

2850
03:15:15,720 --> 03:15:24,760
yes let this be the hour when we draw swords together oh he changed his mind

2851
03:15:25,000 --> 03:15:28,200

2853
03:15:51,320 --> 03:15:55,960
we have to jump in the doorway or we are going to horrifically mess this up do you understand

2854
03:15:55,960 --> 03:16:02,840
jump motherfucker jump no i jumped too early but i knew what i had to do i knew what i had to do

2855
03:16:03,560 --> 03:16:10,040
no okay there's three boxes up ahead if i'm not or it may be the next one

2856
03:16:11,720 --> 03:16:19,400
come on oh please let me do this thing right away oh my god it's the same i need oh my god i

2859
03:16:34,280 --> 03:16:39,000
check back and i'll see the lego ass the recent higher part of the game is excellent if you want

2860
03:16:39,000 --> 03:16:45,320
to explore hog what not a lot you don't gift it i'll literally knew it was there that's the one i

2861
03:16:54,360 --> 03:17:00,040
and gandalf's back in the roster down the hill they go

2862
03:17:09,960 --> 03:17:16,840
and they literally cannot see me when i go outside what's going on here you can ride it

2863
03:17:16,840 --> 03:17:23,480
on god on horseback and get the get it back honestly i messed up the run sequence on

2864
03:17:23,480 --> 03:17:32,920
proto at the start it's the right side i messed it up there and the next one the next level

2865
03:17:32,920 --> 03:17:38,200
also has one like that and there's also one on she loves to lair and i just know i'm going to twat it

2866
03:17:38,200 --> 03:17:54,120
up new characters available to buy

2867
03:17:59,960 --> 03:18:05,240
okay we're almost at 400 000 studs as long as we have enough to buy berserker it's fine

2868
03:18:05,240 --> 03:18:14,920
i can't remember where the times two stud stuff is but once you get like times a billion stud

2869
03:18:14,920 --> 03:18:23,160
it's fine we will wipe your will we get foods or will we play one more and then get food i don't know

2870
03:18:23,560 --> 03:18:37,240
okay saruman's saruman i has moved away to the black gate now so uh frodo and that can't do anything

2871
03:18:37,240 --> 03:18:44,120
so we can't progress here we have to go back to salmon frodo this is like how deeply they thought

2872
03:18:44,120 --> 03:18:49,560
about this game they were like you can't progress type thing so it's really smart i think it was smart

2873
03:18:49,560 --> 03:18:58,680
anyway so we're about to get kidnapped by we're who the fuck when did you join the team okay we're

2874
03:18:58,680 --> 03:19:05,560
with borrow mirrors and brother soramir i'm just i don't actually don't know is then saruman

2875
03:19:06,680 --> 03:19:12,360

2876
03:19:12,360 --> 03:19:23,480
and then i saw that teleport and then we will do the last movie literally that guy's asking for

2877
03:19:23,480 --> 03:19:29,800
help ignore him he doesn't we we don't have the things he desires okay i relate my fire we have

2878
03:19:29,800 --> 03:19:36,920

2879
03:19:37,320 --> 03:19:43,480
he is the crispy brother i've never just i wouldn't say i would i've ever described

2880

2883
03:20:01,960 --> 03:20:09,160
it's calling to himself rodo's not doing well the ring starting to take a good grip on photo the

2884
03:20:09,160 --> 03:20:14,680
poor guy you need to know what happened to boromir oh we about to get the lore the ring drove your

brother mad oh he criss because he got fired by that oh i understand that reference now

2886
03:20:26,520 --> 03:20:34,440
i understand that reference now i get it sad energy what do you think of the voice

2887
03:20:34,440 --> 03:20:40,600
lego games part of the tour my lego star wars is how they convey the story i like if they lift it

2888
03:20:40,600 --> 03:20:48,360
directly from the movie i am fine if it's lifted directly from the movie or if it's not voice acted

2889
03:20:48,360 --> 03:21:05,480
at all um i um enjoy it because um out with a sentence from us jesus uh i enjoy it because yeah as

2890
03:21:05,480 --> 03:21:12,520
you say that did not just happen um wait what was the sentence yes i like it when they do it if

2891
03:21:12,520 --> 03:21:18,040
they actually get voice actors in that aren't the voice actors i find it a bit like not jarring

2892
03:21:18,040 --> 03:21:23,800
not like the makes the game bad but i'm just like like okay i got it out i've got it out it's out

2893
03:21:23,800 --> 03:21:30,440
okay i've got my sentence out too busy look sorry i the the kind of focus the dedication it takes

2894
03:21:30,440 --> 03:21:38,280
to literally move a little bit in a lego game shopping um yes i don't did the new ones end up

2895
03:21:38,280 --> 03:21:50,120
getting things

2896
03:21:58,600 --> 03:22:02,120
it's like someone doing an abridged series more or less of the voices

2897
03:22:02,600 --> 03:22:09,640
and like yeah i'm gonna pop this then we're gonna tell professor sorry my brain's short i need to

2899
03:22:14,200 --> 03:22:19,400

2915
03:24:10,200 --> 03:24:14,680
might be the game for you uh or i feel like lego games highly recommend it very well polished

2916
03:24:14,680 --> 03:24:21,400
she said as a i was praising how polished the game was and then um something may or may not

2917
03:24:21,400 --> 03:24:27,960
happened where the game almost froze on me hehehe but for the most part it's pretty dang polished

2918
03:24:27,960 --> 03:24:33,480
okay all the lego games are peaked even the arkham one i never played the batman one

2919
03:24:34,680 --> 03:24:41,320
um i think mommy is gonna like the performance of that member what does that mean that is so

we're gonna go grab this money here though

2955
03:28:43,240 --> 03:28:47,320

03:28:58,920 --> 03:29:03,800
rhodo oh don't glitch out now don't glitch out now don't glitch out now i'll i will cry if this

2959
03:29:03,800 --> 03:29:12,280
game glitches out it's well polished though but don't glitch out though that completely missed

2960
03:29:12,280 --> 03:29:18,120
the marker that's all i'm gonna say she has a wizarding way i've never seen that one i've played

2961
03:29:18,120 --> 03:29:26,440
this game like three five six is it nicotine or strontine or strontium yeah maybe we should

2962
03:29:26,440 --> 03:29:32,040
say it's not a nicotine the lower behind the the concept artist gave me and i was like yeah this

2963
03:29:32,040 --> 03:29:40,600
looks perfect um oh you can hear the music it fills me with so much happiness here

2964
03:29:42,520 --> 03:29:49,720
it hit a more sensitive area listen it's gimley

2965
03:29:56,040 --> 03:29:56,600
what

2966
03:30:01,080 --> 03:30:08,200
oh i love that sentence a wizard should no better should no better what the heck

2967
03:30:12,520 --> 03:30:29,400
oh i'm getting i'm getting tingly goosebumps i fucking love the end fate i love it so much

2968
03:30:29,960 --> 03:30:37,960
i love it so much i love this fucking part so much it's so fucking juicy right i don't normally

2969
03:30:37,960 --> 03:30:43,720
i was like i'm not gonna do this this this but um these ones i'm gonna do because i'll end up

2970
03:30:43,720 --> 03:30:49,240
forgetting when we do the playthrough over so i'm gonna like grab this stuff and do it right

2971
03:30:49,240 --> 03:30:57,240
we need to destroy the water aqueducts okay so ignore everything else i think it says water

2972
03:30:57,240 --> 03:31:03,480
aqueduct is one of five one of five oh my god you're such an MLG gamer like imagine having

2973
03:31:03,480 --> 03:31:11,160
the brain capacity to even know it was that one come on so there's also three markings on the tower

2974
03:31:11,160 --> 03:31:16,840
as well which we need to destroy they're taking the hobbits to isengard actually the i the the

2975
03:31:16,840 --> 03:31:24,520
hobbits are taking over isengard they ain't taken you know they the the hobbits the hobbits the hobbits

2976
03:31:24,520 --> 03:31:31,640
the hobbits to isengard the hobbits the hobbits the hobbits isengard

2977
03:31:34,200 --> 03:31:37,640
no we are actually supposed to hit that i don't know if we can hit it from here though

2978
03:31:38,360 --> 03:31:43,240
no we're out of range okay if you get too close to the edge um it is a bit too hot for the end

2979
03:31:43,240 --> 03:31:47,800
so we're just gonna drop that it's not a big deal we're gonna break this bridge oh nice we can pick

2980
03:31:47,880 --> 03:31:52,680
it up again i ain't gonna complain we're taking the hobbits to isengard

2981
03:31:54,280 --> 03:32:00,600
break the release the river literally it's okay right we're gonna do the tower one oh i need to

2982
03:32:00,600 --> 03:32:05,720
go back and do that fire one there i've just spotted it sorry i can't believe it i'm not

2983
03:32:05,720 --> 03:32:10,440
doing the most efficient speed round of this game when you said someone did it in eight hours

2984
03:32:10,440 --> 03:32:16,120
ridiculous right there we go that's two of three on the tower we're gonna unfortunately go back

2985
03:32:16,120 --> 03:32:20,600
you need to put that water tower on the fire there's three of them on this map as well

2986
03:32:21,480 --> 03:32:27,000
and just give me a second you know i'm quite big as an ant as an ant

2987
03:32:28,840 --> 03:32:35,640
aim see him i love the song where you get the mithril fire on the oh it's so cute there's like

2988
03:32:35,640 --> 03:32:42,920
the all the please excuse me i'm literally getting stuck in the game um there's a lot of cute items

2989
03:32:42,920 --> 03:32:48,280
that not all the mithril items that we smith at the black smith will have like a super like

2990
03:32:48,280 --> 03:32:56,520
important purpose one of three oh there oh no it's not there's just straight up a treasure under it

2991
03:32:57,400 --> 03:33:01,480
so this should be three of no this is a water wheel oh it is a water wheel hold on i'm just

2992
03:33:01,480 --> 03:33:06,600
analyzing the map i see one all the way over there to the left which we will investigate

2993
03:33:06,600 --> 03:33:10,760
i think that's everything in this area we are getting a nice chunk of change though

2994
03:33:11,000 --> 03:33:16,520
i don't think we need to be worried about funds thankfully like when you buy the

2995
03:33:16,520 --> 03:33:21,880
tames to stud like the red brick and all that i think we're gonna be doing all right

2996
03:33:23,480 --> 03:33:26,040
we're gonna be doing all right um

2997
03:33:29,800 --> 03:33:38,200
uh halfway there saruman the way more like saruman the stinky oh it's such a good meme

2998
03:33:38,200 --> 03:33:41,640
it's a perfect meme it's such a good meme

2999
03:33:58,120 --> 03:34:03,080
right okay let's see we'll go this water one here we're gonna destroy the tower

3000
03:34:04,040 --> 03:34:09,240
that's four or five i'll do the tower one next sorry it takes so long to move around

3001
03:34:09,240 --> 03:34:12,600
just the end this map is massive and all the wee little things you have to do

3002
03:34:13,320 --> 03:34:19,640
if you want to like do it right the first time it's a bit pernicating there's the wee

3003
03:34:19,640 --> 03:34:26,040
wee bits and bobs to do saruman the way is more like saruman the finding out

3004
03:34:26,120 --> 03:34:27,400
fucking me i'm on fire now

3005
03:34:32,680 --> 03:34:37,160
so there we go i guess added automatically it's not like we're gonna reach out and

3006
03:34:37,800 --> 03:34:43,880
grab it we're gonna get this water you guys are asking me if i'm turning australian i'm getting

3007
03:34:43,880 --> 03:34:51,160
this water yeah just need to get this water and then destroy the bridge yeah then mate right

3008
03:34:51,160 --> 03:34:57,880
we're gonna go a little to the left mate not that not the hit video game a little to the left

3009
03:34:57,880 --> 03:35:03,240
the new dlc that came up then we're gonna finish off what we need to do over here why is there

3010
03:35:03,240 --> 03:35:08,840
floating enemies on the bridge i think that they were on the bridge before i destroy no they are

3011
03:35:08,840 --> 03:35:13,560
floating about they're getting stuck on stuff okay it should be a treasure right here

3012
03:35:14,360 --> 03:35:30,120
so then this is the last kind of water wheel type mechanic i think we're doing

3013
03:35:31,720 --> 03:35:34,200
perfect and then there's one more

3014
03:35:34,440 --> 03:35:43,640
okay now looks can be this evening okay look a little to the right

3015
03:35:44,680 --> 03:35:52,600
you're in the main shaft looking for diamonds i okay if i can hit it okay there is something

3016
03:35:52,600 --> 03:36:00,440
here to hit shit i think i have to go around a bit at the top there's a main shaft is i gonna hit it

3017
03:36:00,520 --> 03:36:07,960
okay there we go and it's you can't you will not pick this up because obviously

3018
03:36:07,960 --> 03:36:12,360
you'll be focused on the main objective it's like one of those things i'm so happy you're

3019
03:36:12,360 --> 03:36:18,360
playing the lego game like we're here for the nostalgia they didn't make me do it three times

3020
03:36:18,360 --> 03:36:25,320
blasphemous behavior blasphemous behavior we didn't do it three times not a real video game

3021
03:36:25,320 --> 03:36:30,680
what's oh what oh i'm stuck on something and the camera is not helping either

3022
03:36:31,800 --> 03:36:37,720
absolute blasphem what are you supposed to find in the main part without knowing about let it some

3023
03:36:37,720 --> 03:36:45,000
of this stuff is so hidden like you have to look it up there's no way i refuse i refuse

3024
03:36:48,600 --> 03:36:53,240
how am i supposed to know right we're gonna literally be oh no i think we have to interact

3025
03:36:53,960 --> 03:37:00,120

3050
03:39:46,040 --> 03:39:54,040
internet went wild and then said oh he shoved up and he was getting vibrations mid-match and like

3051
03:39:54,040 --> 03:39:57,720

So, I'm going to do a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of

3082
03:46:26,680 --> 03:46:56,680
a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a

3083
03:46:56,680 --> 03:46:59,880
little bit of a little bit of a little bit

3084
03:46:59,880 --> 03:47:28,480
Stop throwing up, it's fine. I had to go and get some food. Stop. That's funny as

3085
03:47:28,480 --> 03:47:36,080
fuck. Stop throwing up, you're fine. It was three minutes, literally it was two minutes

3086
03:47:36,080 --> 03:47:42,420
thirty for me to put it in the microwave. Okay, it's okay, do these throw up. I put

3087
03:47:42,420 --> 03:47:50,720
Zaro Dumzi Dan. Okay, let's see, let's see. Right, we are on the map called the Secret

3088
03:47:50,720 --> 03:48:03,240
Stairs. Gollum is luring us to Shilob on purpose. Shilob, if you do not take control of Frodo

3089
03:48:03,240 --> 03:48:10,720
he will walk to that fucking gate. I'll just let him, we only need him for a few sections

3090
03:48:10,720 --> 03:48:16,400
and he's about to walk past the section, we actually need him back. But yes, Gollum is

3091
03:48:16,400 --> 03:48:22,000
trying to be naughty naughty and get rid of us because he himself doesn't have the physical

3092
03:48:22,000 --> 03:48:28,880
strength to overpower the two of us, he is emaciated if you didn't know. He definitely,

3093
03:48:28,880 --> 03:48:39,680
where the fuck is he? Stop it, stop it. Yeah, this is getting out of hand. I for thank you

3094
03:48:39,680 --> 03:48:44,680
for cleaning up after the reflins. Look, they don't know what they mean, okay, they just thought

3095
03:48:44,720 --> 03:48:54,120
very well. But yes, the Gollum is aware that he just can't get rid of us, so he's going

3096
03:48:54,120 --> 03:49:03,880
to use Shilob to do it. Where are these bump into? And as I said, we've now entered the

3097
03:49:03,880 --> 03:49:14,840
third movie, so we are actually about to wrap up this section of the game. The world. Where did

3098
03:49:14,840 --> 03:49:28,680
that go? Every least Legos that we can build. We're going to do that, we're going to grab a

3099
03:49:28,680 --> 03:49:35,720
hold of Frodo because he cannot stop walking onto that mountain. Fine. And then what happens after

3100
03:49:35,720 --> 03:49:40,440
that? I don't know. I'm trying to remember the sequence of how the section goes, but I can't.

3101
03:49:41,240 --> 03:49:47,160
We've unlocked the staircase. Oh, maybe one part of the staircase. Well, it will only take me three

3102
03:49:47,160 --> 03:49:52,840
hours to get to the third movie. So what, an hour and a half for like the campaign mode of the movie?

3103
03:49:53,000 --> 03:50:02,360
I think so. We just need to unlock the bottom step. But yeah, Gollum is a mischievous. So

3104
03:50:02,360 --> 03:50:07,560
Smeagol is the good side of Gollum. So when he's all nice and, oh, I would never do that,

3105
03:50:09,000 --> 03:50:15,480
that's what's talking to Smeagol. But when the ring takes over, he becomes Gollum because Gollum

3106
03:50:15,480 --> 03:50:24,280
is actually a hobbit. But the ring, over 500 years, warped him, transformed him.

3107
03:50:27,800 --> 03:50:37,640
It's just a chicken pie. It's a chicken pie with vegetables, chicken, some sort of creamy

3108
03:50:37,640 --> 03:50:45,160
sauce in it. An egg that I boiled and lots of green vegetables. I wasn't kidding when I said

3109
03:50:45,160 --> 03:50:55,560
I'm looking after my health. I'm trying to be dead. I'll munch through this. Yeah, got my egg as well.

3110
03:50:57,880 --> 03:51:06,280
Love me protein. Love me eggs. I wish I could eat red meat more, but I just don't like the taste of

3111
03:51:06,360 --> 03:51:07,960
it that much. Like I do have a steak, but

3112
03:51:17,880 --> 03:51:21,240
Sheila can be a very sexy woman in Shadow of War.

3113
03:51:24,120 --> 03:51:28,120
I have a plan for next week, but I'm a bit worried about it.

3114
03:51:29,000 --> 03:51:32,200
We even jumped that. I feel like we're so tiny as wee hobbits is.

3115
03:51:32,520 --> 03:51:35,000
Oh, it's a very far full.

3116
03:51:40,040 --> 03:51:44,600
I'm going to try and eat this while I play. So if I choke, it's been nice knowing you.

3117
03:51:50,760 --> 03:51:52,520
Okay, eggs are really dry to eat.

3118
03:51:53,240 --> 03:51:59,160
That boiled egg. God damn, why is this so dry inside?

3119
03:52:01,480 --> 03:52:05,720
As if I didn't mash it up and like pop it and boil it more.

3120
03:52:09,320 --> 03:52:17,320
Choking is a little, unless it's, yeah, yeah, I was going to say it. I was going to say it,

3121
03:52:17,320 --> 03:52:22,360
but then, but then you may as well just finish it because you started it. You were thinking it.

3122
03:52:22,760 --> 03:52:25,080
You said it. Oh, we should watch White Chicks soon.

3123
03:52:36,120 --> 03:52:40,520
The game, see, when the game does that, I'm ready to fire on it. Don't be so rude.

3124
03:52:40,520 --> 03:52:42,280
You knew exactly what I was trying to achieve.

3125
03:52:44,040 --> 03:52:48,600
Exactly what I was trying to achieve. I haven't seen the movie in so long.

3126
03:52:49,560 --> 03:52:50,760
It's so ridiculous.

3127
03:52:54,040 --> 03:52:55,880
Oh, that's the Sam thing.

3128
03:53:03,880 --> 03:53:08,200
Sam McGee. What the fuck is his name? Sam? Why is Gamgee? Jesus.

3129
03:53:08,200 --> 03:53:09,800
Why do I think his name is Sam McGee?

3130
03:53:10,920 --> 03:53:12,520
That's it. Everyone's come to Scottish right now.

3131
03:53:12,840 --> 03:53:14,520
I'm going to amighe this and amighe that.

3132
03:53:20,440 --> 03:53:24,120
Okay, trying to eat and play at the same time is truly impossible by all accords.

3133
03:53:25,960 --> 03:53:30,840
I say it happens. There's no way I can eat and play at the same time. Gollum, we need you.

3134
03:53:33,560 --> 03:53:34,600
Okay, thank you, Gollum.

3135
03:53:38,120 --> 03:53:40,120
Gollum, what do you think about the chicken pie?

3136
03:53:40,840 --> 03:53:42,680
Well, it's not fish, is it?

3137
03:53:44,040 --> 03:53:46,680
Okay, now I'm coughing up the egg. Let's not do that.

3138
03:53:46,680 --> 03:53:51,000
As fun as that little gag is, let's not do that. Okay, my voice has had enough for one day.

3139
03:53:53,240 --> 03:53:56,440
Where is the item? Oh, there it is. Oh, it's a build thing.

3140
03:53:59,240 --> 03:54:01,960
Would ASMR a patreon pair session?

3141
03:54:03,320 --> 03:54:07,000
No, gagging's fine. Like, actual choking and asphyxiation is a no-no.

3142
03:54:07,320 --> 03:54:10,120
Oh, wait, this is a Sam thing, damn it.

3143
03:54:11,320 --> 03:54:15,960
Dagnabbit, Sam's supposed to go up here. Right, beat up the little fishpile.

3144
03:54:15,960 --> 03:54:19,400
Beat it up. Show it to his boss. Right, where's Sam? Sam?

3145
03:54:20,920 --> 03:54:27,160
To the one refling that's called Sam. You're so welcome to token. You're so welcome.

3146
03:54:27,160 --> 03:54:32,600
All I'm doing is saying your name. I don't know if any refling would actually be called Frodo.

3147
03:54:32,600 --> 03:54:34,360
Gonna be honest, that might be a bit of a stretch.

3148
03:54:36,440 --> 03:54:41,320
You got Haggis cooking shrimp? I've never prepared Haggis in my life.

3149
03:54:41,320 --> 03:54:46,760
There's no chance of it happening. I wish I was a Sam, real. I'm jealous.

3150
03:54:50,920 --> 03:54:55,800
That's it, I'm doing it. I'm opening up the top 10 boy names.

3151
03:54:55,800 --> 03:55:05,160
Uh, Jack, John, Alex, Sam, I guess, technically.

3152
03:55:06,920 --> 03:55:07,960
What are other boy names?

3153
03:55:11,640 --> 03:55:18,120
Justin? I can't think of 80 guy names. Why is it when you want to think of something,

3154
03:55:18,120 --> 03:55:19,400
your brain's like, I got nothing.

3155
03:55:19,880 --> 03:55:21,400
I could carry it for a while.

3156
03:55:28,440 --> 03:55:33,800
And now the rings making Frodo think that Sam is a platinum.

3157
03:55:35,960 --> 03:55:40,520
James, yeah, James as well. All of J's. J's are really so popular with the pop.

3158
03:55:42,040 --> 03:55:43,640
Joe, Joseph, is that gonna sell?

3159
03:55:43,640 --> 03:55:49,480
Can someone post the top 10 popularity?

3160
03:55:52,440 --> 03:55:54,600
Oh my god, you tried Scottish tablet?

3161
03:55:55,560 --> 03:56:03,320
Matt, oh my god, Scottish tablet. It's delicious. I remember the first time I ate it.

3162
03:56:03,320 --> 03:56:07,000
I eat it by scraping it along my teeth like a weirdo because it's so satisfying.

3163
03:56:07,960 --> 03:56:13,960
Mike, yeah, definitely top 10 stuff. Can I think of like older guy names?

3164
03:56:18,280 --> 03:56:23,000
Okay, so now it's just me and Gollum, but Gollums are naughty, naughty boy.

3165
03:56:25,400 --> 03:56:30,520
You're such a naughty boy. So if we go top left, it should be the design for this level up here,

3166
03:56:30,520 --> 03:56:35,560
the little meat rail. Oh yeah, there it is. You can just beat up this web. At first you

3167
03:56:35,560 --> 03:56:40,680
might think you can't beat past it. No, but you can beat up. Do you like tablet or fudge more?

3168
03:56:40,680 --> 03:56:48,280
Definitely tablet. It would be tablet, then caramel, and then fudge. I'm not the biggest fudge fan.

3169
03:56:50,680 --> 03:56:56,200
Oh, wait, hold on. I'm gonna eat him and move him in game and I'm like, this isn't gonna go well.

3170
03:56:56,200 --> 03:57:02,520
There's gonna be like some special event I need to. But I don't want my fruit to get cold.

3171
03:57:05,880 --> 03:57:14,360
I got free money. Gee, sounds like all money. Is there something over here?

3172
03:57:16,440 --> 03:57:22,920
Nope. No, these are just little decorations. Oh, gee, I wonder if there's a bit of treasure

3173
03:57:22,920 --> 03:57:25,560
behind that. Gee will occurs, it would be sure would be.

3174
03:57:30,040 --> 03:57:34,120
Escaped tablet with my teeth. I don't know why I eat it like that, but it's just the best way to eat it.

3175
03:57:36,520 --> 03:57:45,640
Mmm, Scottish fudge is completely different, I'd believe it. There's this TikToker from the

3176
03:57:45,640 --> 03:57:50,120
Shetland Islands, and she runs like a bakery type thing, then they do deliveries depending on where

3177
03:57:50,120 --> 03:57:59,320
you are. And she's like super fucking popular for all the stuff they can ship. Like if you can ship it

3178
03:57:59,320 --> 03:58:07,800
in the UK, then you can pretty much do it. I'm trying to eat so fast I can't do it.

3179
03:58:12,840 --> 03:58:15,480
Hot chocolate fudge cake with ice creams?

3180
03:58:17,240 --> 03:58:20,840
That's like apple pie and ice cream and stuff, hell yeah.

3181
03:58:23,960 --> 03:58:28,280
No way they put a jumpscare in a child's game. The poor children that play this game

3182
03:58:28,280 --> 03:58:31,720
must have shot their pantylons at that. Oh, like there's she love in the background.

3183
03:58:31,720 --> 03:58:38,520
No, you get back here, she love. You get back here, or else I'm going to beat you up.

3184
03:58:41,000 --> 03:58:48,280
Tablet is just a bar of sugar. Just type in Scottish tablet, it really is just a bar of sugar,

3185
03:58:48,280 --> 03:58:55,080
but it's really bad. What is it? What are you doing, photo? Just take out the flail, okay? Just take

3186
03:58:55,080 --> 03:58:58,360
out. If you're going to be mugged about it, we'll hold this.

3187
03:59:25,400 --> 03:59:32,680
Um, so I can't commentate, eat and think about the gameplay at the same time. I need to pick one.

3188
03:59:33,400 --> 03:59:38,600
I'm eating, I'm hungry, okay? Come on, let me eat me. Let me eat, put me in coach. Wait,

3189
03:59:38,600 --> 03:59:43,080
why did you beat that up? Oh, no, no, no, don't hurt Gollum yet, he hasn't turned.

3190
03:59:46,200 --> 03:59:51,400
I just eat. Oh my god, I can't believe you all make fun of me for being an architect, bro,

3191
03:59:51,400 --> 03:59:55,480
and then you go down to me. Oh my god, that's it, I'm on to you refunds. I'm actually on to you.

3192
03:59:55,480 --> 04:00:00,600
I see how you, I see how you make fun of me. Oh, and then, and then when I do it, when you do it,

3193
04:00:00,600 --> 04:00:04,600
it's fine. No, I'm on to you. Rules for thee, but not for me. Aye, I see it.

3194
04:00:21,960 --> 04:00:38,520
I'm eating. Oh shit, is it left or right left? Is this the one? No, it was right up. Yes, it was right.

3195
04:00:38,520 --> 04:00:52,200
Okay, okay. Okay, right side. Okay, I'm fine, I'm fine. I'm fine. I'm fine. I'm fine. I'm right,

3196
04:00:53,400 --> 04:00:55,400
right, left, right, I'm fine.

3197
04:00:59,160 --> 04:01:01,960
Yeah, we messed up, but we know.

3198
04:01:02,680 --> 04:01:11,160
He's always right. Literally, the developers love the right side of the game.

3199
04:01:16,200 --> 04:01:17,560
The hands on the face.

3200
04:01:22,040 --> 04:01:28,440
Shield for Jamfro. Yeah, mm-hmm. I'm on board with absolutely all suggestions, even slime. I will

3201
04:01:28,440 --> 04:01:34,680
forgive you for slimes. Something tells me that's not the end of them.

3202
04:01:37,640 --> 04:01:42,200
It's you. I'm on your side. I know.

3203
04:01:42,200 --> 04:01:47,960
So sorry, Sam. So sorry.

3204
04:01:50,200 --> 04:01:51,800
They're so, so sorry.

3205
04:01:54,200 --> 04:01:56,040
22.0 for Jamfro. Fuck it.

3206
04:01:57,080 --> 04:02:03,080
Fuck it. Anything you want to get. That map was called Not a Little Fly. Sorry,

3207
04:02:03,960 --> 04:02:09,400
that achievement was called Not a Little Fly. That's very cute. Sam, the greatest of all time.

3208
04:02:10,280 --> 04:02:14,200
No, she loved, she loved father. He was bigger than I'm in.

3209
04:02:16,440 --> 04:02:21,480
I ring VTuber for Jamfro. Jamfro is going to be very curious.

3210
04:02:22,360 --> 04:02:26,680
Do we have a Zebra? I remember someone asked for a Zebra for Jamfro. I'm like, right here.

3211
04:02:27,560 --> 04:02:39,320
Mm-hmm. Sam really is the greatest of all time in their trilogy.

3212
04:02:42,200 --> 04:02:47,640
A hero always needs the helping hand type thing or else,

3213
04:02:48,920 --> 04:02:53,880
or else, you know, the hero can't do his thing like a support fan. I remember reading

3214
04:02:54,520 --> 04:02:58,760
something or I consumed some sort of video and it was like, why is Sam so important? And it was

3215
04:02:58,760 --> 04:03:05,320
more, it was deeper than just like egg V. He's like doing all this stuff. It was like every,

3216
04:03:06,440 --> 04:03:10,200
you know, token did it on purpose because Samwise name means like,

3217
04:03:11,960 --> 04:03:16,200
oh, I can't remember any of the video about consumed it. That's good enough. That's good enough.

3218
04:03:16,200 --> 04:03:21,320
You know what? I did my part. I'm going to burp. I'm so sorry. Oh, that was pathetic burp.

3219
04:03:22,280 --> 04:03:28,760
That's all you can muster. He'll wimp. That's the best burp you can muster. Disgusting.

3220
04:03:45,720 --> 04:03:48,040
Oh, the ice stabbed out. Notice that?

3221
04:03:52,280 --> 04:03:56,840
Mm-hmm. Mummy's losing her burps, honestly.

3222
04:03:58,760 --> 04:04:03,560
God, Frodo cannot catch her, but that's the third time this poor gentleman is being stabbed on

3223
04:04:03,560 --> 04:04:08,920
his adventure. Whenever someone's like, oh, as much as I wanted Frodo to stay in the shire,

3224
04:04:08,920 --> 04:04:14,120
that poor boy, he was so young to go through all of that.

3225
04:04:15,080 --> 04:04:19,080
Um, I can't remember the sequence.

3226
04:04:21,320 --> 04:04:25,080
Honestly, I say that every time we enter a new level. I'm like, oh, I can't remember the sequence.

3227
04:04:25,080 --> 04:04:28,360
I can't remember the sequence. And then I immediately remember what I need to do.

3228
04:04:29,320 --> 04:04:34,680
So we need to scare Sheila into, oh, no, oh, well, no, oh, well, I've done it now.

3229
04:04:34,680 --> 04:04:40,360
I've just dropped both items. Oh, I completely balls that one off. I'm going to be honest,

3230
04:04:40,360 --> 04:04:45,640
balls that one off. Actually, good. Let's try that again. So Sheila will be scared.

3231
04:04:56,200 --> 04:04:57,560
Yes, question mark.

3232
04:05:00,120 --> 04:05:04,040
I don't know what happened there, but yeah, I think we're okay.

3233
04:05:05,880 --> 04:05:06,760
I don't know. I don't know.

3234
04:05:07,560 --> 04:05:16,040
She ground pound and she read it. Did any help come off of her? I don't know if any help.

3235
04:05:16,040 --> 04:05:23,240
Oh, no, we bugging out. I don't know. I'm going to swap to the other guy. I don't know if she's

3236
04:05:23,240 --> 04:05:28,920
taking health damage or not. I'm just spamming the controller. I can't see what we're supposed to do.

3237
04:05:29,480 --> 04:05:37,000
Hi, hi. Thank you for joining me. We'll do it one more time on Sam, which is fine.

3238
04:05:47,880 --> 04:05:52,280
One more time. If it doesn't work, we might have to close and open.

3239
04:05:52,280 --> 04:06:00,840
As I said, the longer the game runs, the more buggy. Oh, well, okay.

3240
04:06:04,840 --> 04:06:14,040
Is this what we were supposed to be seeing? Oh, my God. Oh, we did it. Okay, okay, I counted.

3241
04:06:14,600 --> 04:06:18,920
The big red hitbox. Don't miss it.

3242
04:06:22,680 --> 04:06:27,800
Back you, she demon. Why the spider kind of bad? Don't know.

3243
04:06:35,560 --> 04:06:42,040
Please do not hurt the spider. That was a red one. Yeah, because there's a bug on the screen

3244
04:06:42,040 --> 04:06:47,720
and it's bugging out. Hold on, wait. Oh, that was so funny when there was a bug on screen

3245
04:06:47,720 --> 04:06:55,320
and there was bugging out. All right, all right, all right. Wrap it up. Wrap it up.

3246
04:06:58,200 --> 04:07:01,640
I don't think they want to hurt the spider. No, I don't think they want to hurt it either.

3247
04:07:01,640 --> 04:07:05,160
That shiny shirt. That's mine.

3248
04:07:05,160 --> 04:07:09,320
Wasn't Sam the only mortal to win Sheila? Oh, I didn't know that.

3249
04:07:15,720 --> 04:07:18,280
I finished my food. I'm all healthy and refueled.

3250
04:07:19,400 --> 04:07:24,280
I'm gonna get this done. They took the ring. No, they didn't.

3251
04:07:25,240 --> 04:07:32,360
I beg your pardon, Franklin, but you are mistaken in the good way.

3252
04:07:36,120 --> 04:07:40,840
See, he feels relief holding up. Not like, ah, shit, I'm back on the...

3253
04:07:41,640 --> 04:07:46,040
Oh, my God, he's got his legs are quivering. That's why I want to see you like when I'm finished

3254
04:07:46,040 --> 04:07:52,600
with you. Look at that quivering with anticipation. Oh, Stroney, what are you gonna do next to me?

3255
04:07:53,320 --> 04:08:00,360
I don't know. I've not decided yet. Please, I'll do anything. Yes, exactly. You will do anything

3256
04:08:00,360 --> 04:08:08,440
for me. That's why you will submit. Okay, what does that do?

3257
04:08:11,560 --> 04:08:14,680
Oh, I see it. Bunk.

3258
04:08:15,160 --> 04:08:24,600
Muscle spasms over over taxation. I've seen those ones where like people come out

3259
04:08:24,600 --> 04:08:30,280
of their gym and their legs like having the biggest like muscle spasm to mankind.

3260
04:08:31,240 --> 04:08:34,760
Ooh, we got a cog.

3261
04:08:45,480 --> 04:08:54,360
Why? We can't reach that because we're not an elf. See, I told you this game has issues.

3262
04:08:54,920 --> 04:09:00,280
This game's indeed real. Mimmy ink. Mommy drops a chandelier on you, ASMR, win.

3263
04:09:03,800 --> 04:09:09,560
The amount of memes, I might start putting like ASMR memes on Twitter when it's like a little thingy.

3264
04:09:09,960 --> 04:09:15,240
Maybe I'll make ASMR memes sure it's like like a really silly thing but I can't turn it into

3265
04:09:15,240 --> 04:09:21,000
like a full-blown role-player or anything like that. That would be quick.

3266
04:09:23,560 --> 04:09:26,840
Right, they're breaking down the door. They're breaking down the door. Oh wait, you can just

3267
04:09:26,840 --> 04:09:32,200
skip these guys. Yeah, I remembered. You could just skip it. We do even need to fight them.

3268
04:09:32,200 --> 04:09:35,720
I love when games do that where they put in like secret things. You can skip and you

3269
04:09:35,720 --> 04:09:41,960
love to everything about it again. Have you seen when it's a mouse crawling under this kit?

3270
04:09:41,960 --> 04:09:48,520
Wait, what? Like in the mummy with a scarab? Okay, we're not allowed to get past the gate

3271
04:09:48,520 --> 04:09:55,960
without looking like an orc, okay? We need to look like an orc or else we're not getting anywhere.

3272
04:09:56,040 --> 04:10:06,040
So, we're gonna bonk this pipe and then we're gonna get an armor piece for him and then Sam's

3273
04:10:06,040 --> 04:10:15,960
gonna be covered and he farts at me. That was loud enough to be picked up on make. I just want you

3274
04:10:15,960 --> 04:10:21,320
guys to know that if I didn't mute you literally would have heard that. So, Sam now has a chest

3275
04:10:21,320 --> 04:10:29,080
plate. We just need a helm for Sam and we are gonna avoid them because I don't want to get into

3276
04:10:29,080 --> 04:10:38,840
trouble. I don't even know where you came from. You had muscle cramps so bad. You need to have

3277
04:10:41,240 --> 04:10:50,840
bananas are good for you. Where or where? I'm supposed to burn this I guess and then you jump on

3278
04:10:50,840 --> 04:11:00,760
that. We're burning this whole fortress to the ground. Oh yeah, it's like the high table.

3279
04:11:05,480 --> 04:11:07,320
We're gonna catapult ourselves up.

3280
04:11:10,280 --> 04:11:16,040
Certainly looks like it. I don't know what it looks like for you, chief. It certainly looks like it to

3281
04:11:16,040 --> 04:11:26,680
be. It's really magnesium. I have been lied to. I've been misled. I can't believe it. I've been

3282
04:11:26,680 --> 04:11:33,480
deceived. What's got magnesium in it? I don't even know. Name one magnesium food source right now.

3283
04:11:34,440 --> 04:11:42,840
You can't eat that. All right, I think Frodo. Oh no, I need Frodo to come up here.

3284
04:11:43,800 --> 04:11:50,200
What's this? A helmet? Sure. I'll put a stick on Frodo. Magnesium supplements. Milk or magnesium?

3285
04:11:54,440 --> 04:11:59,560
I've got some reeflings that are deficit and have a deficit in magnesium.

3286
04:12:01,400 --> 04:12:06,120
Okay, so what you need to do and it took me forever to find this one. You need to go invisible so he

3287
04:12:06,120 --> 04:12:14,200
doesn't close the damn gate. Okay. Spinach? Spinach. Potassium, magnesium, sodium are all

3288
04:12:15,560 --> 04:12:20,600
fishies. I don't eat much fish. I should eat fish. I should make an effort to eat more fish.

3289
04:12:21,560 --> 04:12:24,760
So you need to go secret mode and then climb up here and then you done.

3290
04:12:28,200 --> 04:12:34,760
Grab that. Break this apart. Nope, other side I guess. Break this apart and then get the handle

3291
04:12:34,760 --> 04:12:41,960
and then you can Hulk smash down the Gimli-style wire and then beat the crap out of the guy at the

3292
04:12:41,960 --> 04:12:51,320
door because he's annoying and he stinks. Oh brother. And then give Sam the helmet and then

3293
04:12:51,320 --> 04:12:56,680
we'll take Frodo to do the chest plate up ahead. Oh no, we need Sam again. We need Sam to burn

3294
04:12:56,680 --> 04:13:14,840
the fire this way. There's a fish monger near me and I never know what to order because I ordered

3295
04:13:14,840 --> 04:13:27,320
shit. Oh no, I was doing so well. I was doing so well not to say that for so long. Just goes to

3296
04:13:27,320 --> 04:13:35,560
show you can you have it all, can you? Not you, can you? No you can't. Well if you're going to be on

3297
04:13:35,560 --> 04:13:43,880
the floor, how about you stay there? Oh that's fine. You stay there and get the rest of them.

3298
04:13:44,520 --> 04:13:49,560
She can't help it. I still haven't downloaded it literally to show it at the start of stream

3299
04:13:50,920 --> 04:13:55,800
because it's just a redonkulousness. Does that give me? Oh it doesn't give me adventure. Jeez.

3300
04:13:56,760 --> 04:14:02,520
And when we can't stop the Rebecca's takeaway, we can take that one as well.

3301
04:14:05,800 --> 04:14:13,080
Everyone has their downsides. Like no one can be perfect and mine's clearly fucking brain-wrong.

3302
04:14:14,760 --> 04:14:19,640
Hi hi, please let us through. We're just two little orcs. We're just really malnourished and we

3303
04:14:19,640 --> 04:14:25,880
don't look like anyone else for no particular reason. For no particular reason. Have you had

3304
04:14:25,880 --> 04:14:33,560
fish and chips in Melbourne? Aye and it's rubbish. I'm sorry. It's not haddock. We have haddock in

3305
04:14:33,560 --> 04:14:38,680
Scotland in the first time. I had a fish and chip here and it was minging. I was like I'm not eating

3306
04:14:38,680 --> 04:14:46,920
that again so I can't eat it because you guys have gummy shark or something. Although I'll give you

3307
04:14:47,480 --> 04:14:52,520
one up for anyone that's Australian. When you have takeaway, like fish and chips takeaway,

3308
04:14:52,520 --> 04:14:59,000
they make it fresh like batch whereas in Scotland they put it in the band marie which is the

3309
04:14:59,000 --> 04:15:05,720
heating up device machine thing in Melbourne. They put it in a band marie and just let it sit for

3310
04:15:05,720 --> 04:15:18,440
extra amount of time type thing. Sorry I farted. 83% Britbong fish and chips is poor. Literally I'll

3311
04:15:18,440 --> 04:15:34,600
miss that about in Scotland. The brain rot is too deep in the reason. Thank you tiny spadey.

3312
04:15:35,160 --> 04:15:51,480
Honestly. If it's perfect for you, it may not be perfect for you but perfect for you.

3313
04:15:52,360 --> 04:16:10,840
Okay so now we need to go back to Legolas and the gang gang gang gang because he's now looking

3314
04:16:10,840 --> 04:16:16,600
at Mount Doom so we can't progress as Sam and Matt. As I said this is why this game is like really

3315
04:16:16,600 --> 04:16:22,680
well made. It's like they literally thought that was someone please think of the lore implications

3316
04:16:22,680 --> 04:16:32,280
please stop this madness. This is literally me. This reminds me how much I love Lord of the Rings.

3317
04:16:33,960 --> 04:16:40,520
I like fantasy especially when there's like no capitalism fantasy. I said it sorry I said it.

3318
04:16:40,760 --> 04:16:48,440
I just want a nice cosy poverty. Imagine being nice and pally and your neighbours and that.

3319
04:16:49,480 --> 04:16:52,840
The worst thing that happens in your day is like a wee bit of gossip or something.

3320
04:16:53,960 --> 04:16:59,320
That's the life and you share your produce with each other and just it's peaceful. They're out

3321
04:16:59,320 --> 04:17:04,280
gardening all what you up to the day and it's like same old same old boring shit and just like oh it's

3322
04:17:04,280 --> 04:17:11,640
a peaceful life you know reading books and just I got my Gimli, I got my Vigo, I got my books,

3323
04:17:11,640 --> 04:17:20,840
I got my Reefland. You know that's the simplest. We don't want riches beyond our wildest means.

3324
04:17:20,920 --> 04:17:26,840
We don't want you know XYZ brainwashing from its future.

3325
04:17:29,480 --> 04:17:32,280
No Pippin! Pippin!

3326
04:17:32,280 --> 04:17:41,720
Pippin! Help! Gannops!

3327
04:17:45,720 --> 04:17:46,840
Fool of a Toke!

3328
04:17:48,840 --> 04:17:51,720
Fool of a Toke! Sorry I veered that squeak when I'm leaning into.

3329
04:17:52,440 --> 04:17:53,720
What did you see?

3330
04:17:55,480 --> 04:18:00,920
There was a white tree. It caught the other stone. It was dead.

3331
04:18:02,520 --> 04:18:09,800
Dun dun dun. It was a premonition of his attack.

3332
04:18:14,680 --> 04:18:16,360
Just cracked my neck.

3333
04:18:16,360 --> 04:18:20,680
Don't do that. Don't crack your neck. Hydration and posture check. Oh my yep.

3334
04:18:20,680 --> 04:18:22,520
Still a little posture of a shrimp. Thanks for checking.

3335
04:18:23,160 --> 04:18:28,600
Hydration absolutely awful. My hands are sweating. They're glistening. Actually speaking of glistening

3336
04:18:28,600 --> 04:18:35,240
hands. Wipe it on my motherfucking napkin. Just gamer girl problems.

3337
04:18:36,520 --> 04:18:40,360
See you're a guy. You wouldn't understand how hard we gamer girls game.

3338
04:18:41,240 --> 04:18:47,880
We get sweaty hands because we're so into it. Our feet literally ripping. You cannot comprehend

3339
04:18:48,840 --> 04:18:55,480
how deeply into a game that girls game. I'm sorry it has to be this way.

3340
04:18:55,640 --> 04:19:00,680
Really? What the fuck am I even on about? I'm losing it. Right where the heck are we?

3341
04:19:01,560 --> 04:19:07,800
So we did that cuts. Oh we're doing the hall of the dead. Yes I see it. Up there's the hall of the

3342
04:19:07,800 --> 04:19:12,920
the hall of the dead? I mean maybe the crypt of the dead. We're about to get the ghost army.

3343
04:19:14,440 --> 04:19:20,040
I hear feet dripping. Say less let me join. Are girls just chronically dehydrated or something?

3344
04:19:21,000 --> 04:19:26,360
I have attributes on why I'm dehydrated but I wouldn't be surprised if it's a

3345
04:19:26,360 --> 04:19:33,400
shared trait. Wouldn't be shocked if it's a shared trait. We're like fucking pet hamsters that

3346
04:19:33,400 --> 04:19:40,440
just perish randomly like before these particles. I'm so dehydrated.

3347
04:19:41,160 --> 04:19:50,200
Never forget that Tuk family are a fey blood which is a magical being in their lineage is

3348
04:19:50,200 --> 04:19:54,840
entirely possible. Pippin is Gandalf's great-great-great-grandson and that's why he tolerates the

3349
04:19:54,840 --> 04:20:03,560
fillery. Six thousand. Less than half of what I'd hoped for. Six thousand. We ride to death.

3350
04:20:07,720 --> 04:20:10,680
You making the sound wait six years? We're for any case you know.

3351
04:20:12,520 --> 04:20:20,200
Girls just randomly moving. Dun dun dun. The horses are spooked. Like if an animal is spooked out

3352
04:20:20,200 --> 04:20:22,840
listen to that motherfucking thing they know a lot more than we do.

3353
04:20:28,520 --> 04:20:32,440
Who's behind there? Who's behind the cape?

3354
04:20:32,760 --> 04:20:36,680
Oh my god face reveal.

3355
04:20:42,040 --> 04:20:42,680
We don't have any.

3356
04:20:58,040 --> 04:21:00,840
Get some water if you feel dehydrated. Can't put it dry as a cold.

3357
04:21:02,440 --> 04:21:25,080
What kind of army would linger in such a place? One that is cursed. Long ago the

3358
04:21:25,080 --> 04:21:31,240
men of the mountain swore an oath to the last king Gondor to come to his aid to fight but when

3359
04:21:31,240 --> 04:21:37,640
the time came when Gondor's mood was dire they fled vanishing the darkness of the mountain

3360
04:21:37,640 --> 04:21:42,280
and so we soon do a custom never to rest until we have fulfilled their pledge.

3361
04:21:44,840 --> 04:21:52,440
The way is shown. Magic's already quick to special though. It's glowing.

3362
04:21:52,680 --> 04:22:04,040
Dun dun dun we're going to through the mountain. Secret secret ghost army.

3363
04:22:05,480 --> 04:22:13,720
Right now this is the most annoying level okay so there's little things on the ground that'll

3364
04:22:13,720 --> 04:22:21,160
suck you in if you are silly enough to stand on them okay and it just holds up the gameplay

3365
04:22:21,160 --> 04:22:27,240
so dramatically. I'll see if I can point out where one is but see those like little air vents

3366
04:22:27,240 --> 04:22:32,520
suction things if you stand on it it holds on to you for so long and it's so frustrating

3367
04:22:32,520 --> 04:22:36,520
like bruv I'm just trying to play the game please let me go and it'll do it every single time you

3368
04:22:36,520 --> 04:22:42,920
stand on it and it's everywhere in this map. I will fart on the eyelashes of the game developer

3369
04:22:42,920 --> 04:22:48,200
who put that in because I have to admit that was that was low bro that was low and you got

3370
04:22:48,200 --> 04:22:55,560
void getting sucked literally. I'm not here for the suck right now. I'm trying to speedrun

3371
04:22:55,560 --> 04:23:01,800
I'm the fastest fastest person to play this game which is absolutely nonsense but I'm still the

3372
04:23:01,800 --> 04:23:11,160
fastest player like I can see the suck I'm avoiding it at all costs. And then it's time for you

3373
04:23:12,120 --> 04:23:19,400
and it's time to try hard and then it's time to do this and then push this down so we can get

3374
04:23:19,400 --> 04:23:27,560
Gimli to come up here and we'll build a ladder you want you want me to show you the suck it's so

3375
04:23:27,560 --> 04:23:33,480
bad I'll show you it when I come across one then it's just such a tame waste and I'm like

3376
04:23:34,120 --> 04:23:41,640
please I'm on my knees please okay so I don't know if Gimli naturally perishes at this point

3377
04:23:43,320 --> 04:23:51,320
this so this happens every time and you're stuck it's just like literally so annoying

3378
04:23:52,200 --> 04:23:56,920
so you have to avoid everything at all costs avoid them all

3379
04:23:57,160 --> 04:24:01,480
no if I'm not let's stay down

3380
04:24:03,880 --> 04:24:07,560
actually spotted that don't think I didn't see that purple gem okay I didn't see

3381
04:24:09,560 --> 04:24:18,040
any percent speedrun is one hour no that's glitches that's glitches out the wazoo one hour

3382
04:24:18,040 --> 04:24:23,320
how can anyone do this in one hour the cutscenes alone must make up 50 percent of that speedrun

3383
04:24:24,280 --> 04:24:29,480
that is impossible that is not possible what kind of glitches are people brah I need to watch the

3384
04:24:29,480 --> 04:24:37,560
speedrun after we do this because we're playing we're playing more tomorrow like we're gonna 100

3385
04:24:37,560 --> 04:24:44,280
percent tomorrow we were just gonna do the campaign today but that is outrageous one hour

3386
04:24:45,160 --> 04:24:52,680
and how much did that speedrun of lego lord of the ring set you back and it was that is a very

3387
04:24:52,760 --> 04:25:00,120
specific mirror it's like the there's a guy and he's like how much how much did that fresh

3388
04:25:00,120 --> 04:25:06,920
Rolex set you back and she says an hour and he goes and what but he says it like

3389
04:25:12,840 --> 04:25:16,920
feed him up feed him up feed him up feed him up money money money

3390
04:25:17,240 --> 04:25:26,120
it's tomorrow going to be speedrunning no no no we're literally going to replay

3391
04:25:26,120 --> 04:25:35,000
through the game but as the characters like the free play the free play so we can actually do it

3392
04:25:35,880 --> 04:25:40,360
I always mess up this section I never remember what I'm supposed to actually do

3393
04:25:40,360 --> 04:25:45,240
oh this sword just poked me

3394
04:25:47,320 --> 04:25:53,480
uh I think there's also a treasure under here oh well there you go yeah okay thank you memory

3395
04:25:53,480 --> 04:25:58,280
you're welcome yes my brain when it comes to remembering important information

3396
04:25:59,080 --> 04:26:03,240
nonexistent my brain to remember the hidden treasures that annoyed me that one time I played

3397
04:26:03,320 --> 04:26:11,000
the game oh you'll have to toss me

3398
04:26:13,880 --> 04:26:15,000
take them take them

3399
04:26:17,800 --> 04:26:20,920
okay then put them down and do this and then we are

3400
04:26:23,480 --> 04:26:31,720
we're all done crawling something everybody tosses the door just like me for room

3401
04:26:32,520 --> 04:26:37,000
uh I would like jump you up and down on my knee and stuff because you're like smaller than me

3402
04:26:37,000 --> 04:26:41,720
which makes it a lot easier to do stuff to you what I didn't mean it like that I meant like

3403
04:26:41,720 --> 04:26:48,760
you know I don't I've got weak arms and stuff like I can bounce you on my knee and like do all the

3404
04:26:52,760 --> 04:26:55,960
like a lord of the rings what was from the past yeah you're welcome

3405
04:26:56,920 --> 04:27:02,440
who knew this feature would be so based in her game choices if you ignore blinks

3406
04:27:05,720 --> 04:27:13,800
we are currently on the third movie and we are about to acquire oh can be scared

3407

3447
04:31:34,280 --> 04:31:39,640
million by the time we do the campaign mode unless there's one that's just randomly like

is you can like destroy stuff and pick up a lot more coins especially if you have stud attractor

3457
04:33:00,920 --> 04:33:08,040

lot so fingers crossed we don't get the glitch fingers crossed we on a wee pony he must oh he

3464
04:33:46,280 --> 04:33:51,560

3465
04:33:52,600 --> 04:33:55,960

okay hell easy for you to say Gandalf you've got magic

3470
04:34:33,800 --> 04:34:36,600
You can be a little hocus pocus, and you're halfway across the map.

3471
04:34:42,600 --> 04:34:45,240
Stangyard Grund, man! Stangyard Grund!

3472
04:34:45,240 --> 04:34:46,760
Sorry, it's not that bad.

3473
04:34:51,880 --> 04:34:53,240
That was a straight up, huh?

3474
04:34:55,000 --> 04:34:57,160
The Riders of Rohan!

3475
04:34:57,720 --> 04:34:59,400
No, no, is this not the man of...

3476
04:34:59,400 --> 04:35:01,480
No, it is the Riders of Rohan. Sorry.

3477
04:35:02,440 --> 04:35:07,240
Whatever happens, stay with me. I'll go to you.

3478
04:35:07,240 --> 04:35:09,000
I like how they shot the mustache one.

3479
04:35:09,000 --> 04:35:10,280
Right now!

3480
04:35:13,000 --> 04:35:13,640
Elephant!

3481
04:35:13,640 --> 04:35:17,560
The Ruin and the Wild Dandy!

3482
04:35:24,040 --> 04:35:26,040
It hit the horse like, oh, excuse me.

3483
04:35:32,360 --> 04:35:42,600
Okay, the boxes! Fuck the boxes!

3484
04:35:44,520 --> 04:35:45,960
Okay, there's three boxes.

3485
04:35:45,960 --> 04:35:48,040
I'm fucking going mental trying to find these boxes.

3486
04:35:48,040 --> 04:35:50,680
I can't see them, and the camera is changing angle.

3487
04:35:50,680 --> 04:35:51,880
I'm getting nervous, I'm getting shaky.

3488
04:35:51,880 --> 04:35:53,320
I see it, I see it, I see it.

3489
04:35:53,320 --> 04:35:54,920
See that, see that camera angle.

3490
04:35:54,920 --> 04:35:55,720
See that camera angle?

3491
04:35:55,720 --> 04:35:56,760
You think you can outdo me?

3492
04:35:56,760 --> 04:35:57,960
Sorry, I've played this game too much.

3493
04:35:58,680 --> 04:35:59,880
You think you can outdo me?

3494
04:35:59,880 --> 04:36:02,680
I might have failed four other times previously,

3495
04:36:02,680 --> 04:36:03,800
but this time, no.

3496
04:36:03,800 --> 04:36:04,360
I will win.

3497
04:36:04,360 --> 04:36:05,080
Do you understand?

3498
04:36:05,080 --> 04:36:06,520
I win, you lose game.

3499
04:36:06,520 --> 04:36:08,120
I know exactly where the boxes are.

3500
04:36:08,120 --> 04:36:09,800
I don't, I think it's to the left a little.

3501
04:36:09,800 --> 04:36:10,840
A little to the left.

3502
04:36:10,840 --> 04:36:12,120
Oh, I don't know, I can't see it.

3503
04:36:12,120 --> 04:36:13,000
I actually can't see it.

3504
04:36:16,040 --> 04:36:17,240
I can't see it.

3505
04:36:17,240 --> 04:36:18,920
I'm tryharding to find the last spot.

3506
04:36:18,920 --> 04:36:19,400
There it is!

3507
04:36:20,120 --> 04:36:20,760
I'm coming!

3508
04:36:22,200 --> 04:36:23,400
Nope, that wasn't it.

3509
04:36:23,400 --> 04:36:23,960
We got played.

3510
04:36:23,960 --> 04:36:25,160
Oh no, the box!

3511
04:36:25,160 --> 04:36:26,520
Okay, forget the stud.

3512
04:36:26,520 --> 04:36:27,160
Get the stud.

3513
04:36:27,160 --> 04:36:27,880
Okay, I'll take that.

3514
04:36:27,880 --> 04:36:28,440
Where's the box?

3515
04:36:29,000 --> 04:36:29,880
Oh, the box!

3516
04:36:31,880 --> 04:36:34,040
The hitbox gave us it.

3517
04:36:34,040 --> 04:36:35,400
The hitbox gave us it.

3518
04:36:35,400 --> 04:36:38,200
I love this game.

3519
04:36:38,200 --> 04:36:41,080
I love this game.

3520
04:36:41,080 --> 04:36:42,360
Oh, what did?

3521
04:36:42,360 --> 04:36:43,800
We accidentally just picked one up.

3522
04:36:43,800 --> 04:36:45,480
I didn't even do anything for it.

3523
04:36:45,480 --> 04:36:47,560
I love this game.

3524
04:36:47,560 --> 04:36:51,160
I didn't have to do anything.

3525
04:36:51,160 --> 04:36:52,920
All of them girl gins for real.

3526
04:36:52,920 --> 04:36:54,920
Come on, come on!

3527
04:36:54,920 --> 04:36:55,320
Come on!

3528
04:36:55,320 --> 04:36:56,920
Come on, come on!

3529
04:36:56,920 --> 04:36:57,720
Come on!

3530
04:36:57,720 --> 04:37:27,560
I will kill you if you touch it.

3531
04:37:28,040 --> 04:37:29,960
The horse nodded in agreement.

3532
04:37:31,320 --> 04:37:34,200
Okay, this is where it glitches out a lot.

3533
04:37:34,200 --> 04:37:36,200
So please, video game.

3534
04:37:37,640 --> 04:37:39,320
I urge you, video game.

3535
04:37:39,320 --> 04:37:40,600
Don't be a meanie-boobie-nee.

3536
04:37:41,960 --> 04:37:42,600
Don't be mean.

3537
04:37:43,160 --> 04:37:43,720
Oh, I'm sorry.

3538
04:37:43,720 --> 04:37:44,760
I didn't do anything.

3539
04:37:47,000 --> 04:37:48,120
It glitched out.

3540
04:37:48,120 --> 04:37:49,720
Do you see I'm running on the dragon?

3541
04:37:50,440 --> 04:37:51,800
No way!

3542
04:37:52,840 --> 04:37:54,440
It glitched out on the dragon.

3543
04:37:54,520 --> 04:38:04,120
This is, I don't know if I need to restart or I need to do this opening sequence again.

3544
04:38:08,360 --> 04:38:09,000
I'll quit.

3545
04:38:10,440 --> 04:38:12,200
And then we'll go back in the instance.

3546
04:38:12,200 --> 04:38:14,360
And if it's still broken at that sequence,

3547
04:38:15,480 --> 04:38:17,480
we'll have to close the game and open it up again.

3548
04:38:19,000 --> 04:38:20,280
It's very buggy.

3549
04:38:20,280 --> 04:38:22,600
It's very buggy on the dragon for some reason.

3550
04:38:22,600 --> 04:38:23,720
I think because it's a lander.

3551
04:38:25,080 --> 04:38:25,580
Oh!

3552
04:38:28,760 --> 04:38:32,120
I mean, no, no.

3553
04:38:34,120 --> 04:38:37,640
No, okay, let me, let me close the, uh,

3554
04:38:39,480 --> 04:38:40,760
quit to win this.

3555
04:38:40,760 --> 04:38:42,200
We're talking to game quit to win this.

3556
04:38:42,200 --> 04:38:43,400
Oh, my screen went black.

3557
04:38:43,400 --> 04:38:46,040
So hopefully you don't see anything you're not supposed to see.

3558
04:38:46,440 --> 04:38:52,760
Uh, right.

3559
04:38:52,760 --> 04:38:53,880
Let's try that again.

3560
04:38:55,400 --> 04:38:59,960
This is the instance thing I was talking about where the game is like XD.

3561
04:39:01,400 --> 04:39:02,840
Oh, my screen's black again.

3562
04:39:02,840 --> 04:39:04,040
So it was nice on you.

3563
04:39:06,280 --> 04:39:11,320
Please, OBS, register the game without me having to change anything.

3564
04:39:11,880 --> 04:39:12,600
Yes!

3565
04:39:12,600 --> 04:39:13,560
Oh, thank God.

3566
04:39:13,560 --> 04:39:15,160
Right, so it will work now.

3567
04:39:15,880 --> 04:39:19,080
For some reason, the longer the game goes on for,

3568
04:39:19,080 --> 04:39:21,800
the more, you know, memory leakage and stuff happens.

3569
04:39:21,800 --> 04:39:24,920
It is perfectly natural when the game does that.

3570
04:39:24,920 --> 04:39:28,600
We might have to play the horse sequence again,

3571
04:39:28,600 --> 04:39:30,520
but for us, it's not a big deal.

3572
04:39:33,320 --> 04:39:34,280
What's that folder?

3573
04:39:34,280 --> 04:39:35,160
Technicals kind of open?

3574
04:39:35,160 --> 04:39:36,440
No, no, no, no, don't open that one.

3575
04:39:36,440 --> 04:39:37,560
Don't open that one.

3576
04:39:37,560 --> 04:39:41,160
I used to be obsessed with technicals when I first discovered, um,

3577
04:39:41,400 --> 04:39:48,280
you know, um, I don't know why I was so obsessed with it.

3578
04:39:48,280 --> 04:39:50,200
And then it went away, but now that I'm,

3579
04:39:50,200 --> 04:39:51,880
I have to admit, now that I'm a little cult fish,

3580
04:39:51,880 --> 04:39:54,280
I'm like, I'm interested again, you know?

3581
04:39:56,840 --> 04:39:59,480
Oh, man, he used to be, right.

3582
04:39:59,480 --> 04:40:02,440
We're going to skip because we've done this before,

3583
04:40:02,440 --> 04:40:03,160
so we're going to skip.

3584
04:40:04,280 --> 04:40:07,720
Um, but as I said, we should,

3585
04:40:07,720 --> 04:40:10,200
should be all good in glory and we know what to do.

3586
04:40:10,280 --> 04:40:14,280
Uh, if, uh, if I'm not daft enough and miss a box somehow,

3587
04:40:14,280 --> 04:40:15,160
then I don't.

3588
04:40:15,960 --> 04:40:17,400
I'll just spam X anyway.

3589
04:40:17,400 --> 04:40:20,840
It seems like it's prompting me to spam the spears for some reason.

3590
04:40:21,960 --> 04:40:25,320
Um, and saying Lord, you're up, true and real.

3591
04:40:25,320 --> 04:40:27,400
What happens if I was going to be a cult fish all along?

3592
04:40:27,640 --> 04:40:41,480
I wonder what video started that all.

3593
04:40:42,680 --> 04:40:47,560
I think it was just, I like the idea of like uncontrollable

3594
04:40:49,000 --> 04:40:50,680
thing does thing to you.

3595
04:40:51,960 --> 04:40:53,560
And that's where it kind of came from.

3596
04:40:53,560 --> 04:40:56,920
From, I don't know where I got the last thing, by the way.

3597
04:40:58,360 --> 04:40:59,560
The last treasure.

3598
04:40:59,560 --> 04:41:01,080
It just kind of happened.

3599
04:41:01,080 --> 04:41:02,120
I wasn't paying attention.

3600
04:41:02,680 --> 04:41:03,080
Okay.

3601
04:41:03,080 --> 04:41:03,480
Yeah.

3602
04:41:03,480 --> 04:41:03,720
Okay.

3603
04:41:03,720 --> 04:41:04,840
It just happens naturally.

3604
04:41:04,840 --> 04:41:05,320
That's fine.

3605
04:41:06,280 --> 04:41:12,280
Um, and like I watched, uh, I watched.

3606
04:41:12,280 --> 04:41:14,440
No, it was like this comic.

3607
04:41:14,440 --> 04:41:16,680
It's a really good, high rated series.

3608
04:41:17,320 --> 04:41:19,800
What a comic or some man go.

3609
04:41:19,800 --> 04:41:21,960
God, you can literally tell in such a game or a weeb.

3610
04:41:21,960 --> 04:41:25,720
Um, and it was, it's this series.

3611
04:41:25,800 --> 04:41:28,840
It's about that plot where, um, she's like,

3612
04:41:29,560 --> 04:41:34,920
is it a, she visits like a tentacle shop where it sells tentacles of different variety.

3613
04:41:34,920 --> 04:41:38,040
And then I think she ends up working there by the end of the series.

3614
04:41:38,040 --> 04:41:41,640
There's probably a few more installments, but you might know what I'm on about.

3615
04:41:42,600 --> 04:41:43,240
I don't know.

3616
04:41:45,160 --> 04:41:46,520
It's not an animation.

3617
04:41:48,200 --> 04:41:48,760
Right.

3618
04:41:48,760 --> 04:41:50,680
Please don't, please don't glitch out.

3619
04:41:50,680 --> 04:41:51,400
I'm going to cry.

3620
04:41:52,280 --> 04:41:55,880
Please don't glitch out because I don't know what to do if you do.

3621
04:41:57,800 --> 04:41:58,520
Okay.

3622
04:41:58,520 --> 04:41:59,240
Okay.

3623
04:41:59,240 --> 04:41:59,800
Okay.

3624
04:41:59,800 --> 04:42:00,280
Mm-hmm.

3625
04:42:00,920 --> 04:42:01,720
Let him get up.

3626
04:42:01,720 --> 04:42:02,360
Let him get up.

3627
04:42:02,360 --> 04:42:02,680
Okay.

3628
04:42:02,680 --> 04:42:03,480
He's moving.

3629
04:42:03,480 --> 04:42:05,640
He's not doing the running animation in the seat.

3630
04:42:06,840 --> 04:42:07,640
Come on.

3631
04:42:07,640 --> 04:42:08,360
Come on game.

3632
04:42:09,160 --> 04:42:09,720
Come on.

3633
04:42:09,720 --> 04:42:10,680
No, no day elite.

3634
04:42:10,680 --> 04:42:11,320
Come on.

3635
04:42:11,320 --> 04:42:12,840
Only the first time I played this game.

3636
04:42:14,040 --> 04:42:14,680
Nine hours.

3637
04:42:16,840 --> 04:42:17,960
Does Mary need to do it?

3638
04:42:17,960 --> 04:42:19,400
Does he need to be brave?

3639
04:42:19,400 --> 04:42:20,120
What's going on?

3640
04:42:20,120 --> 04:42:21,080
We're going back and forth.

3641
04:42:21,080 --> 04:42:22,200
You're making me nervous.

3642
04:42:23,400 --> 04:42:25,160
You're making me nervous game.

3643
04:42:25,800 --> 04:42:27,880
I need to do something.

3644
04:42:27,880 --> 04:42:28,280
All right.

3645
04:42:30,040 --> 04:42:31,880
I need you to do something.

3646
04:42:31,880 --> 04:42:34,200
I need you to fight me.

3647
04:42:35,640 --> 04:42:36,600
I'm getting nervous.

3648
04:42:38,760 --> 04:42:40,120
He's not even attacking me.

3649
04:42:45,880 --> 04:42:48,280
The only time I'm happy an enemy attacks me

3650
04:42:49,240 --> 04:42:51,320
is literally because he's not glitching out.

3651
04:42:52,520 --> 04:42:52,760
Okay.

3652
04:42:52,760 --> 04:42:54,760
He should smash his head down next.

3653
04:42:57,720 --> 04:42:59,560
He should smash his head down next.

3654
04:43:02,360 --> 04:43:02,840
Okay.

3655
04:43:02,840 --> 04:43:03,160
Okay.

3656
04:43:03,720 --> 04:43:03,960
Okay.

3657
04:43:03,960 --> 04:43:04,440
We're doing it.

3658
04:43:04,440 --> 04:43:04,840
We're doing it.

3659
04:43:04,840 --> 04:43:05,400
We're doing it.

3660
04:43:05,400 --> 04:43:06,280
He's not glitched out.

3661
04:43:11,800 --> 04:43:12,600
Let's get to it.

3662
04:43:14,440 --> 04:43:16,360
You're pushing me back with his wings.

3663
04:43:16,920 --> 04:43:19,240
My wings are like a hurricane.

3664
04:43:20,840 --> 04:43:23,480
Did you guys watch the behind the scenes on making the Hobbit?

3665
04:43:25,400 --> 04:43:32,440
Benedict Cumberbatch was like method acting the dragon and they had to import like some very

3666
04:43:32,440 --> 04:43:38,760
particular like will of an animal or something to get him to shuffle about to get the cleanest

3667
04:43:38,760 --> 04:43:44,280
noise possible while he was doing the method acting and he was like in this suit on top of this

3668
04:43:44,280 --> 04:43:47,160
like a fluff type thing.

3669
04:43:48,040 --> 04:43:49,800
Oh no, his head didn't get bashed.

3670
04:43:51,640 --> 04:43:52,280
Okay, there we go.

3671
04:43:57,560 --> 04:44:00,360
And like Peter Jackson's like I was rather odd didn't expect that.

3672
04:44:02,840 --> 04:44:05,080
I think it's that beneficial cucumber.

3673
04:44:05,080 --> 04:44:05,880
Yes, exactly.

3674
04:44:07,160 --> 04:44:09,320
Bless you for streaming so long like on watch after work.

3675
04:44:09,320 --> 04:44:10,120
Had a bad day.

3676
04:44:10,120 --> 04:44:11,720
Turn wind to some leg was nice.

3677
04:44:11,720 --> 04:44:12,360
Oh, I'm here.

3678
04:44:13,480 --> 04:44:15,960
I'm sorry to hear that you had a shite day at work.

3679
04:44:16,760 --> 04:44:23,960
Honestly, Dinny, the one question I ask you right now, do you get paid enough to give a

3680
04:44:23,960 --> 04:44:26,040
shit about what happened at work at home?

3681
04:44:26,840 --> 04:44:28,360
And the answer is no.

3682
04:44:28,920 --> 04:44:33,320
Okay, you look after yourself and do what you need to do to feel better.

3683
04:44:34,040 --> 04:44:37,640
If that's food, if that's hydrating, if that's taking a 30 minute post-work job,

3684
04:44:37,720 --> 04:44:43,560
you do that and make sure you look after yourself because sure as hell,

3685
04:44:43,560 --> 04:44:47,880
your work ain't going to look after you with their fucking minuscule paycheck that they give you.

3686
04:44:50,920 --> 04:44:53,000
Oh, we slayed the beast.

3687
04:44:53,000 --> 04:44:56,600
Now it's time to deal with it and clock out forget work.

3688
04:44:58,600 --> 04:45:00,120
If I'm taking a job, I'm doing it on the clock.

3689
04:45:01,000 --> 04:45:06,360
I love, I love that so much.

3690
04:45:07,960 --> 04:45:18,680
Okay, now we need to build these platforms.

3691
04:45:18,680 --> 04:45:24,280
So this is like the troll at the start and where he goes on the platform.

3692
04:45:24,280 --> 04:45:25,720
So I'm going to grab these purples.

3693
04:45:26,280 --> 04:45:27,240
I'm going to sneeze.

3694
04:45:27,240 --> 04:45:28,200
So I'm going to sneeze.

3695
04:45:30,200 --> 04:45:32,360
So he does that and then you jump away.

3696
04:45:32,360 --> 04:45:41,800
And then again with the EO, let him swing.

3697
04:45:41,800 --> 04:45:46,200
He'll scream and then that's him locked in and then just wallop on.

3698
04:45:49,160 --> 04:45:51,960
And then break this up and then this might be the last one.

3699
04:45:51,960 --> 04:45:52,840
Yeah, that looks like it.

3700
04:45:58,760 --> 04:45:59,400
Okay, there we go.

3701
04:45:59,400 --> 04:45:59,880
Last one.

3702
04:46:00,600 --> 04:46:07,880
So you hear the scream move away and Bob's your uncle answer Fanny time for the cut scene.

3703
04:46:09,320 --> 04:46:11,640
And then you need to get him to beat him up.

3704
04:46:11,640 --> 04:46:12,120
I think.

3705
04:46:12,120 --> 04:46:13,800
Oh, oh, maybe not.

3706
04:46:19,800 --> 04:46:26,200
No, he hurt himself doing that.

3707
04:46:29,880 --> 04:46:35,400
Yeah, bless you.

3708
04:46:44,040 --> 04:46:48,520
The place like a balloon latex bros are winning in that scene.

3709
04:46:51,960 --> 04:46:53,480
Your thumbnail just gave me an idea.

3710
04:46:53,480 --> 04:46:57,080
What about Lego mini figurines of all the veiler girls as merit?

3711
04:46:57,960 --> 04:47:00,360
We can't get the rights to Lego.

3712
04:47:03,080 --> 04:47:07,880
Hey, is that an asset used from Pirates of the Caribbean?

3713
04:47:08,600 --> 04:47:09,080
How dare they?

3714
04:47:09,080 --> 04:47:09,560
I can't believe it.

3715
04:47:09,560 --> 04:47:10,920
Can't believe the reuse of assets.

3716
04:47:10,920 --> 04:47:11,480
Beat him up.

3717
04:47:15,000 --> 04:47:15,880
The army of the dead.

3718
04:47:19,480 --> 04:47:23,080
I can't wait for them to remaster Lord of the Rings in the Hobbit.

3719
04:47:23,080 --> 04:47:24,680
I don't know who they'll get to play them.

3720
04:47:24,680 --> 04:47:30,840
But I can just just know that in the future when you hear that the official remasters are coming out,

3721
04:47:31,480 --> 04:47:37,080
just know that I'll be an old wee granny and to my billion cats and I'll be happy.

3722
04:47:37,080 --> 04:47:39,080
Fuck, you just feel like goddamn.

3723
04:47:39,080 --> 04:47:40,200
I remember that strongy.

3724
04:47:40,200 --> 04:47:41,400
She was a fucking freak.

3725
04:47:43,240 --> 04:47:43,960
And you loved it.

3726
04:47:47,160 --> 04:47:52,040
So you need to put the arrows on so you can climb up and then basically just

3727
04:47:52,120 --> 04:47:52,920
go around the other way.

3728
04:47:54,440 --> 04:47:56,120
Can you cheeky doodle and jump up here?

3729
04:47:56,120 --> 04:47:56,440
You can.

3730
04:47:58,520 --> 04:48:00,760
I'm 50-50 on the remaster.

3731
04:48:00,760 --> 04:48:08,680
I honestly wouldn't mind seeing it if they pimped it the fuck out and actually put the funds

3732
04:48:08,680 --> 04:48:12,120
behind it and it wasn't a cash grab remaster.

3733
04:48:12,120 --> 04:48:14,680
I would love to see Lord of the Rings.

3734
04:48:14,680 --> 04:48:15,560
Where am I?

3735
04:48:16,280 --> 04:48:17,800
Am I stuck on the elephant?

3736
04:48:17,800 --> 04:48:19,480
I'm on the elephant's ball sack.

3737
04:48:20,360 --> 04:48:27,640
I don't know if you saw that, but I was currently stuck on the ball sack of an elephant.

3738
04:48:27,640 --> 04:48:28,920
So that could have gone better.

3739
04:48:28,920 --> 04:48:29,400
I'm going to be honest.

3740
04:48:29,400 --> 04:48:30,120
It could have gone better.

3741
04:48:30,920 --> 04:48:33,560
Okay, I need to somehow slash his anchors.

3742
04:48:39,240 --> 04:48:40,840
That's the first time that's ever happened to me.

3743
04:48:40,840 --> 04:48:41,400
I have to admit.

3744
04:48:42,680 --> 04:48:43,400
Spank his head.

3745
04:48:44,200 --> 04:48:45,160
Not the elephant.

3746
04:48:45,160 --> 04:48:53,480
Go back home to wherever you can somehow sufficiently enrich your body because you're

3747
04:48:53,480 --> 04:48:57,800
so large, the amount of calories you would need at any given day is astronomical.

3748
04:48:59,400 --> 04:49:00,200
Like whales.

3749
04:49:00,200 --> 04:49:05,160
Yeah, I don't know how whales eat plankton and still like nutritionally their body.

3750
04:49:06,440 --> 04:49:08,280
It doesn't seem like it would work out in theory.

3751
04:49:08,280 --> 04:49:11,400
So there's three more Oly fans going to enter Ministeris.

3752
04:49:11,400 --> 04:49:16,440
They're going to attempt to enter Ministeris, but the problem is we're in the way.

3753
04:49:18,280 --> 04:49:20,280
First things first in the argon one.

3754
04:49:22,040 --> 04:49:24,520
So when she spank the legs, feed them up.

3755
04:49:24,520 --> 04:49:25,240
Feed them up.

3756
04:49:25,240 --> 04:49:25,560
Feed them up.

3757
04:49:25,560 --> 04:49:25,880
Feed them up.

3758
04:49:25,880 --> 04:49:26,040
Feed them up.

3759
04:49:26,040 --> 04:49:27,320
Feed them up.

3760
04:49:27,320 --> 04:49:27,800
Eat them up.

3761
04:49:27,800 --> 04:49:28,200
Eat them up.

3762
04:49:28,200 --> 04:49:28,520
Feed them up.

3763
04:49:28,520 --> 04:49:29,080
Feed them up.

3764
04:49:29,080 --> 04:49:30,120
There's a lot of plankton.

3765
04:49:31,720 --> 04:49:33,080
Swim around with her mouth open.

3766
04:49:33,960 --> 04:49:34,840
Me at the convention.

3767
04:49:35,960 --> 04:49:36,840
Maybe I should be in a wheelchair.

3768
04:49:38,200 --> 04:49:39,480
Okay, that's one of them.

3769
04:49:40,120 --> 04:49:42,280
Next one is currently waiting in line.

3770
04:49:42,280 --> 04:49:43,960
Oh, and it's another argon one.

3771
04:49:45,400 --> 04:49:45,800
Okay.

3772
04:49:46,920 --> 04:49:50,680
I'm not complaining because all I have to do is hit X on argon's ones where the

3773
04:49:50,680 --> 04:49:53,640
Legolas actually have to have like some mild input.

3774
04:50:00,520 --> 04:50:04,680
Imagine not having the literally background to understand the style of English and written

3775
04:50:05,240 --> 04:50:09,480
would use man to mean human change and they'll manage them to get higher turn rate for the

3776
04:50:09,480 --> 04:50:09,960
franchise.

3777
04:50:11,080 --> 04:50:14,040
Look, it is what it is.

3778
04:50:15,960 --> 04:50:16,440
No, no, no.

3779
04:50:16,440 --> 04:50:17,480
Don't turn it.

3780
04:50:17,480 --> 04:50:18,680
Don't turn around.

3781
04:50:20,680 --> 04:50:21,000
Okay.

3782
04:50:21,000 --> 04:50:21,880
Now you can do it.

3783
04:50:21,880 --> 04:50:22,840
Let me up.

3784
04:50:22,840 --> 04:50:23,240
Other way.

3785
04:50:24,200 --> 04:50:24,760
Yay.

3786
04:50:24,760 --> 04:50:25,400
And then other way.

3787
04:50:25,880 --> 04:50:26,280
Yay.

3788
04:50:27,080 --> 04:50:27,880
Then up we go.

3789
04:50:28,920 --> 04:50:29,400
Maybe.

3790
04:50:31,880 --> 04:50:33,160
Then I said easy peasy.

3791
04:50:35,240 --> 04:50:38,360
And then I believe that is the defense of Minas Tirith.

3792
04:50:40,360 --> 04:50:43,960
Then is it just Mount Doomin?

3793
04:50:45,960 --> 04:50:47,800
I thought it was about to fall off the map.

3794
04:50:47,800 --> 04:50:50,040
I thought it was about to fall off the map.

3795
04:50:53,320 --> 04:50:54,200
Hug on achievement.

3796
04:50:56,120 --> 04:50:57,800
That all of them is Legolas.

3797
04:50:57,800 --> 04:51:00,280
It still only counts as one as the achievement name.

3798
04:51:01,160 --> 04:51:02,040
We already did that.

3799
04:51:02,040 --> 04:51:02,920
Did we not?

3800
04:51:02,920 --> 04:51:03,480
I don't know.

3801
04:51:04,680 --> 04:51:07,640
The army is now going through Minas Tirith and protecting the

3802
04:51:08,200 --> 04:51:08,600
out of it.

3803
04:51:11,640 --> 04:51:12,120
Oh no.

3804
04:51:14,520 --> 04:51:17,320
He's going to pop his wee clogs, his wee Lego clogs.

3805
04:51:20,600 --> 04:51:23,000
Oh, I love when they do that.

3806
04:51:23,000 --> 04:51:23,640
I'm so sorry.

3807
04:51:23,640 --> 04:51:25,160
I love when they do that stuff in the

3808
04:51:25,880 --> 04:51:27,160
like in Lego.

3809
04:51:27,160 --> 04:51:30,200
No, he's gone.

3810
04:51:30,200 --> 04:51:30,680
No.

3811
04:51:30,920 --> 04:51:35,400
He's called Leifeler.

3812
04:51:37,800 --> 04:51:39,080
The horse came back up again.

3813
04:51:40,840 --> 04:51:41,480
Gandalf.

3814
04:51:47,560 --> 04:51:48,200
Oh no.

3815
04:51:48,200 --> 04:51:49,320
He's traumatized.

3816
04:51:50,280 --> 04:52:05,000
There's a black gate fight and then is it Mount Doom?

3817
04:52:05,000 --> 04:52:05,720
And that's it.

3818
04:52:05,720 --> 04:52:06,280
We've done.

3819
04:52:14,360 --> 04:52:15,640
Chance is a success.

3820
04:52:16,600 --> 04:52:17,800
What are we waiting for?

3821
04:52:20,280 --> 04:52:24,200
Oh, the battle of Hell in our field.

3822
04:52:24,200 --> 04:52:26,680
I guess that's what's called right outside Minas Tirith.

3823
04:52:27,960 --> 04:52:30,440
I think there's two missions to go.

3824
04:52:31,080 --> 04:52:34,360
One's called the black gate and the last one's called Mount Doom.

3825
04:52:34,360 --> 04:52:35,240
And we've done it.

3826
04:52:36,040 --> 04:52:38,200
We've done it, ladies and gentlemen.

3827
04:52:39,560 --> 04:52:41,320
I don't know if Mercy is coming on.

3828
04:52:41,320 --> 04:52:44,200
I may be able to or maybe I don't know as a result of this.

3829
04:52:45,160 --> 04:52:47,400
Mercy might be on question mark.

3830
04:52:47,400 --> 04:52:48,760
Question mark.

3831
04:52:48,840 --> 04:52:49,240
Oh my god.

3832
04:52:49,240 --> 04:52:50,600
We literally only have two unlock cards.

3833
04:52:57,720 --> 04:52:58,440
The last one today.

3834
04:52:58,440 --> 04:52:58,600
No.

3835
04:53:14,440 --> 04:53:18,680
No, no, the treasures could be mildly hotter.

3836
04:53:18,680 --> 04:53:19,240
We're not going to like.

3837
04:53:19,240 --> 04:53:21,720
We have a few more treasures.

3838
04:53:23,640 --> 04:53:24,680
Gimli's just me.

3839
04:53:25,800 --> 04:53:26,840
Certainty of death.

3840
04:53:26,840 --> 04:53:28,040
Small chance of success.

3841
04:53:28,040 --> 04:53:29,240
Well, let's go for it.

3842
04:53:30,040 --> 04:53:31,720
He literally said send it.

3843
04:53:31,720 --> 04:53:32,120
Oh my god.

3844
04:53:32,120 --> 04:53:33,320
Gimli is such a zoomer.

3845
04:53:35,720 --> 04:53:36,360
All right.

3846
04:53:37,560 --> 04:53:42,360
Is this the second last one?

3847
04:53:42,360 --> 04:53:43,160
It may be.

3848
04:53:43,160 --> 04:53:43,800
I'm not sure.

3849
04:53:47,080 --> 04:53:48,280
Or is there one in here?

3850
04:53:48,920 --> 04:53:49,480
I don't know.

3851
04:53:51,320 --> 04:53:53,480
My brain is failing me right now.

3852
04:53:53,480 --> 04:53:54,920
Actually, sorry.

3853
04:53:54,920 --> 04:53:59,400
I have to admit, the meeting was quite eye-opening.

3854
04:53:59,400 --> 04:54:02,520
So we've got a lot of me more in here.

3855
04:54:02,520 --> 04:54:04,520
We've got a lot of me more in here.

3856
04:54:04,520 --> 04:54:06,920
Um, we've got a lot of me more in here.

3857
04:54:06,920 --> 04:54:07,480
Can't believe it.

3858
04:54:07,480 --> 04:54:07,800
Oh my god.

3859
04:54:07,800 --> 04:54:08,680
I can't believe I have to think.

3860
04:54:08,680 --> 04:54:10,760
Oh, I just can't.

3861
04:54:10,760 --> 04:54:13,320
Oh, I just teleported right on my butthole.

3862
04:54:13,320 --> 04:54:14,520
Um, yeah, I can't believe it.

3863
04:54:14,520 --> 04:54:14,840
Oh my god.

3864
04:54:14,840 --> 04:54:15,480
I have to think.

3865
04:54:15,480 --> 04:54:16,760
Oh, it's just terrible news.

3866
04:54:16,760 --> 04:54:17,960
It's the most, it is.

3867
04:54:18,680 --> 04:54:20,440
Oh, we just can't do it.

3868
04:54:20,440 --> 04:54:21,800
Where are we going?

3869
04:54:21,800 --> 04:54:23,640
Am I supposed to be Frodo right now?

3870
04:54:28,200 --> 04:54:31,160
We are going on an adventure and a half.

3871
04:54:31,160 --> 04:54:33,160
Are we backtracking to the black gate?

3872
04:54:34,600 --> 04:54:36,040
Why are we going through the swan?

3873
04:54:37,160 --> 04:54:37,880
Get off the horse.

3874
04:54:39,400 --> 04:54:40,040
What?

3875
04:54:40,040 --> 04:54:41,000
Where is it taking?

3876
04:54:42,120 --> 04:54:42,440
Right.

3877
04:54:42,440 --> 04:54:42,840
Hold on.

3878
04:54:42,840 --> 04:54:43,720
Hold on a minute.

3879
04:54:43,720 --> 04:54:43,960
Right.

3880
04:54:43,960 --> 04:54:45,880
You are taking me to the black gate,

3881
04:54:45,880 --> 04:54:48,200
but you're taking me like the most weirdest way ever.

3882
04:54:48,200 --> 04:54:49,720
We're literally having to go through the swamp

3883
04:54:49,720 --> 04:54:50,520
to get to the black gate.

3884
04:54:51,560 --> 04:54:52,920
No, Legolas.

3885
04:54:52,920 --> 04:54:55,000
Obviously, you're supposed to jump onto the island.

3886
04:54:56,200 --> 04:54:57,480
What does that already mean?

3887
04:54:57,480 --> 04:54:58,200
Yeah.

3888
04:54:58,200 --> 04:54:59,800
Already considering Leos.

3889
04:54:59,800 --> 04:55:00,520
Real and true.

3890
04:55:00,520 --> 04:55:02,040
I can't believe the vealers falling

3891
04:55:02,040 --> 04:55:02,840
far to the tomb on black.

3892
04:55:03,960 --> 04:55:05,560
He needs a skeleton key, I think,

3893
04:55:05,560 --> 04:55:06,680
if I remember correctly.

3894
04:55:11,880 --> 04:55:13,080
So let's pop you.

3895
04:55:14,040 --> 04:55:16,440
And then we'll make it to the black gate.

3896
04:55:20,120 --> 04:55:21,480
Wait, I could have teleported?

3897
04:55:23,960 --> 04:55:25,640
I could have teleported to avoid all that.

3898
04:55:25,640 --> 04:55:26,040
You know what?

3899
04:55:26,040 --> 04:55:26,520
Doesn't matter.

3900
04:55:26,520 --> 04:55:26,920
We're here.

3901
04:55:26,920 --> 04:55:27,640
That's the main thing.

3902
04:55:27,640 --> 04:55:28,440
We're at the black gate.

3903
04:55:29,000 --> 04:55:29,480
We're doing it.

3904
04:55:29,480 --> 04:55:29,960
We're doing it.

3905
04:55:30,840 --> 04:55:31,560
Empty your head.

3906
04:55:31,560 --> 04:55:32,520
It's easier that way.

3907
04:55:32,520 --> 04:55:32,920
Real.

3908
04:55:32,920 --> 04:55:34,200
Making hypnosis for myself.

3909
04:55:34,200 --> 04:55:36,520
Or it's just emptying a month or nine or an hour.

3910
04:55:37,400 --> 04:55:39,000
You could just start drooling on yourself

3911
04:55:39,000 --> 04:55:40,200
because that would be, well,

3912
04:55:41,640 --> 04:55:42,760
that would be very nice.

3913
04:55:44,040 --> 04:55:46,360
And we sadly need to lay off.

3914
04:55:46,360 --> 04:55:47,480
Strongie needs to...

3915
04:55:47,480 --> 04:55:49,320
Strongie's being forced to go offline

3916
04:55:49,320 --> 04:55:51,560
because she's streaming every day.

3917
04:55:52,200 --> 04:55:52,840
Exy.

3918
04:55:52,840 --> 04:55:54,520
We're totally worried for her health.

3919
04:55:54,520 --> 04:55:56,280
Like, yeah, about you all.

3920
04:55:59,000 --> 04:56:01,560
We are going to discover this stone real quick.

3921
04:56:01,560 --> 04:56:04,120
But yeah, I think we're literally the black gate

3922
04:56:04,120 --> 04:56:05,960
and then mount them.

3923
04:56:07,640 --> 04:56:08,440
And we're done.

3924
04:56:09,800 --> 04:56:10,440
We did it.

3925
04:56:11,240 --> 04:56:12,280
We did it.

3926
04:56:12,280 --> 04:56:13,080
For Frodo.

3927
04:56:16,680 --> 04:56:17,160
Take part.

3928
04:56:17,160 --> 04:56:18,200
Like, the guys are playing.

3929
04:56:19,560 --> 04:56:20,520
We need to sadly...

3930
04:56:21,880 --> 04:56:25,000
Sexual menace and deviant to society.

3931
04:56:25,000 --> 04:56:26,040
The what gate?

3932
04:56:27,080 --> 04:56:27,720
Black.

3933
04:56:28,600 --> 04:56:29,560
What is that bad word?

3934
04:56:30,280 --> 04:56:32,760
That the lord of the black line come forth.

3935
04:56:33,800 --> 04:56:35,000
Come forth, game.

3936
04:56:35,000 --> 04:56:36,200
Hear ye, hear ye.

3937
04:56:36,200 --> 04:56:37,880
I demand to speak to the monster.

3938
04:56:39,960 --> 04:56:40,920
You know you're still streaming.

3939
04:56:41,320 --> 04:56:44,040
You know, Strongie has to stay.

3940
04:56:44,680 --> 04:56:46,440
I can't stay online forever.

3941
04:56:46,440 --> 04:56:47,240
I'm going to perish.

3942
04:56:48,920 --> 04:56:50,600
I'm going to try and go for a walk, I think.

3943
04:56:55,560 --> 04:56:56,440
Men of the West.

3944
04:56:57,880 --> 04:56:59,080
Oh, it's for Frodo.

3945
04:57:01,080 --> 04:57:03,720
This is the part I always, like, start choking up in the movie.

3946
04:57:04,360 --> 04:57:05,400
I can't handle it.

3947
04:57:11,000 --> 04:57:11,560
Can't handle it.

3948
04:57:11,560 --> 04:57:12,360
I'm going to vomit.

3949
04:57:12,360 --> 04:57:13,000
I'm going to vomit.

3950
04:57:13,000 --> 04:57:13,640
Can't handle it.

3951
04:57:13,640 --> 04:57:14,140
Right.

3952
04:57:21,400 --> 04:57:23,560
There are archery targets in the back.

3953
04:57:25,960 --> 04:57:28,600
If I can just very quickly get them so I don't have to do it

3954
04:57:28,600 --> 04:57:30,040
when I come back to replaying

3955
04:57:30,040 --> 04:57:31,880
because I'm always going to end up forgetting.

3956
04:57:33,240 --> 04:57:34,600
Where is Gimli?

3957
04:57:34,600 --> 04:57:35,080
Gimli.

3958
04:57:37,240 --> 04:57:39,560
Honestly, my cat's been made a little outside the door.

3959
04:57:39,960 --> 04:57:41,880
I'm not going to be surprised if I open the door

3960
04:57:41,880 --> 04:57:44,600
and she's just staring at me like, you keep calling.

3961
04:57:46,040 --> 04:57:47,560
I called five times.

3962
04:57:47,560 --> 04:57:47,880
Right.

3963
04:57:47,880 --> 04:57:48,920
AI time.

3964
04:57:48,920 --> 04:57:50,120
So we're standing on it.

3965
04:57:51,240 --> 04:57:51,720
Roar.

3966
04:57:53,080 --> 04:57:54,360
Jump.

3967
04:57:54,360 --> 04:57:54,680
Okay.

3968
04:57:54,680 --> 04:57:55,560
I missed it.

3969
04:57:55,560 --> 04:57:58,120
I missed it, but that's not the point.

3970
04:57:58,120 --> 04:57:58,920
That's not the point.

3971
04:57:59,640 --> 04:58:01,720
I thought I had to do the arrow bone arrow thing.

3972
04:58:02,360 --> 04:58:04,120
No, don't start getting nauseated.

3973
04:58:04,120 --> 04:58:07,080
Do you know we've still got like another two hours or something?

3974
04:58:07,080 --> 04:58:08,840
Don't start vomiting on me, young man.

3975
04:58:09,880 --> 04:58:11,240
You're not a soft pan.

3976
04:58:12,120 --> 04:58:12,520
Right.

3977
04:58:12,520 --> 04:58:13,240
Stop getting...

3978
04:58:15,880 --> 04:58:18,520
Beat these up so we can build the next thing for him.

3979
04:58:21,080 --> 04:58:23,720
Oh, destroy what's in front of you, Legolas.

3980
04:58:23,720 --> 04:58:24,600
Please, darling.

3981
04:58:25,880 --> 04:58:26,440
I'm trying.

3982
04:58:26,440 --> 04:58:26,680
Right.

3983
04:58:26,680 --> 04:58:27,400
There we go.

3984
04:58:27,400 --> 04:58:28,440
We've got the building thing.

3985
04:58:29,320 --> 04:58:29,960
Only two hours.

3986
04:58:31,320 --> 04:58:31,960
Oh, sorry.

3987
04:58:31,960 --> 04:58:32,920
Which five hours?

3988
04:58:33,400 --> 04:58:34,120
I've really...

3989
04:58:34,120 --> 04:58:36,760
Have I got used to used to like the 12 hour endurance?

3990
04:58:40,040 --> 04:58:40,680
Okay, there we go.

3991
04:58:40,680 --> 04:58:43,000
He's going to wallop himself and then something else is going to happen.

3992
04:58:46,920 --> 04:58:48,120
Okay, hour gone time.

3993
04:58:49,080 --> 04:58:50,520
We're pre-throwing up.

3994
04:58:50,520 --> 04:58:50,840
No.

3995
04:58:52,840 --> 04:58:54,040
Not for Bambino.

3996
04:58:55,080 --> 04:58:56,200
I'm getting beaten up by us.

3997
04:58:57,400 --> 04:58:59,160
We need to destroy the orange.

3998
04:59:00,920 --> 04:59:03,480
Not to be confused with the door hinge.

3999
04:59:07,160 --> 04:59:08,760
I think I've spoiled too much.

4000
04:59:10,360 --> 04:59:10,840
Oh, sorry.

4001
04:59:10,840 --> 04:59:12,840
I just hit Gandalf in the back with an arrow.

4002
04:59:12,840 --> 04:59:13,560
Sorry, old man.

4003
04:59:13,560 --> 04:59:14,280
Didn't mean that one.

4004
04:59:16,440 --> 04:59:20,440
Like, see how the lava is blowing up in the background at Maldun?

4005
04:59:22,600 --> 04:59:24,840
Things are getting ready to blow.

4006
04:59:26,920 --> 04:59:28,040
Oh, no, please.

4007
04:59:28,040 --> 04:59:29,160
No more of these.

4008
04:59:29,160 --> 04:59:30,600
They glitch out all the time.

4009
04:59:30,600 --> 04:59:31,000
Please.

4010
04:59:32,600 --> 04:59:33,000
Please.

4011
04:59:33,640 --> 04:59:34,600
No more.

4012
04:59:34,600 --> 04:59:36,120
I can't take any more.

4013
04:59:37,240 --> 04:59:39,000
What am I supposed to do with them?

4014
04:59:39,000 --> 04:59:40,280
Or is it like last time?

4015
04:59:41,160 --> 04:59:41,960
Please don't glitch out.

4016
04:59:41,960 --> 04:59:42,680
Please don't glitch out.

4017
04:59:42,680 --> 04:59:43,480
Please don't glitch out.

4018
04:59:43,480 --> 04:59:43,880
I beg.

4019
04:59:48,120 --> 04:59:48,920
Please don't glitch out.

4020
04:59:50,200 --> 04:59:51,400
Oh, sorry.

4021
04:59:51,400 --> 04:59:51,800
Okay.

4022
04:59:51,800 --> 04:59:55,320
Uh, I can see the point on his chest that I'm supposed to hit.

4023
04:59:58,040 --> 04:59:58,440
Okay.

4024
05:00:03,160 --> 05:00:03,880
Okay, good.

4025
05:00:05,240 --> 05:00:06,840
As if I just supposed to do that.

4026
05:00:06,840 --> 05:00:08,360
Oh, he disappears already.

4027
05:00:09,880 --> 05:00:12,360
Y'all meant for glitches and things.

4028
05:00:13,880 --> 05:00:15,720
It's because you mentioned woman.

4029
05:00:15,720 --> 05:00:16,600
Because, you know.

4030
05:00:18,120 --> 05:00:19,400
Look, we're little babies.

4031
05:00:19,400 --> 05:00:20,440
What am I going to do with you?

4032
05:00:23,880 --> 05:00:26,520
What's going to happen when I actually need to break?

4033
05:00:28,280 --> 05:00:32,680
Like, if I released the schedule and it said I was taking a day off,

4034
05:00:33,560 --> 05:00:35,320
is it like complete meltdown?

4035
05:00:35,320 --> 05:00:36,840
Like, are we in major trouble?

4036
05:00:37,560 --> 05:00:41,480
Or, um, oh, I can't do anything here.

4037
05:00:44,120 --> 05:00:49,480
Uh, because I'm going to start getting worried that, uh, it's not, uh,

4038
05:00:49,480 --> 05:00:51,880
you guys aren't going to do, feel so good if I take a day off.

4039
05:00:53,800 --> 05:00:57,080
Like, I'm still going to be crazy enough to try and stream every single day.

4040
05:00:59,080 --> 05:01:00,520
And for a year.

4041
05:01:01,640 --> 05:01:03,080
But it is plausible.

4042
05:01:03,080 --> 05:01:05,480
You know, my health is going to catch up to me to the point.

4043
05:01:05,880 --> 05:01:07,400
Severe depression.

4044
05:01:07,400 --> 05:01:08,200
No, you're not.

4045
05:01:08,200 --> 05:01:10,200
Oh, are you?

4046
05:01:10,200 --> 05:01:14,200
We scorn means a lot of cleaning up from me.

4047
05:01:14,200 --> 05:01:29,000
But if you do that three times, no, he's already slain.

4048
05:01:30,680 --> 05:01:32,200
The day starting takes a day off.

4049
05:01:32,200 --> 05:01:34,040
I'm going to get so much done.

4050
05:01:34,040 --> 05:01:34,840
Please don't get sick.

4051
05:01:36,440 --> 05:01:37,880
I'm going to, I'm changing my

4052
05:01:38,520 --> 05:01:39,640
jaw yet.

4053
05:01:39,640 --> 05:01:41,640
And I'm going to knock off the takeout.

4054
05:01:42,280 --> 05:01:45,560
Uh, I'm going to try and up my natural exercise,

4055
05:01:45,560 --> 05:01:47,640
like going outside and just for a walk and stuff.

4056
05:01:47,640 --> 05:01:50,600
And I might be able to grab more seats, actually, like a week.

4057
05:01:50,600 --> 05:01:51,000
That's right.

4058
05:01:51,000 --> 05:01:53,640
If you see, if you see me entering your garden, no, you don't.

4059
05:01:54,440 --> 05:01:54,840
No, you don't.

4060
05:01:54,840 --> 05:01:56,200
I need the seats more than you do.

4061
05:01:56,200 --> 05:01:56,600
Okay.

4062
05:01:57,320 --> 05:01:58,440
I need them more than you do.

4063
05:01:59,240 --> 05:02:07,400
I would cry, but I would cry harder if let me hurt.

4064
05:02:08,600 --> 05:02:09,880
I'll be in the trenches if you go.

4065
05:02:10,680 --> 05:02:14,760
I mean, in theory, if I really was going to take, like,

4066
05:02:14,760 --> 05:02:18,440
a considerable time off, like three days off in a row,

4067
05:02:18,440 --> 05:02:21,720
I kid you not, I could very most likely record,

4068
05:02:23,240 --> 05:02:25,880
like, Valtro and ASMR type thing.

4069
05:02:26,840 --> 05:02:29,640
So it's not, wait, how do I take your armor off?

4070
05:02:32,680 --> 05:02:34,440
How do I take his thing off?

4071
05:02:36,120 --> 05:02:38,120
Does he need to smash the ground or something?

4072
05:02:39,960 --> 05:02:40,840
I can't, bro.

4073
05:02:40,840 --> 05:02:41,800
I can't 1v1 you.

4074
05:02:41,800 --> 05:02:42,920
You're like massive.

4075
05:02:42,920 --> 05:02:43,240
Okay.

4076
05:02:43,240 --> 05:02:44,360
He just gets tired.

4077
05:02:44,360 --> 05:02:44,920
Understandable.

4078
05:02:44,920 --> 05:02:45,560
Have a nice day.

4079
05:02:47,400 --> 05:02:47,960
Okay.

4080
05:02:47,960 --> 05:02:49,320
He just gets tired of swinging.

4081
05:02:50,040 --> 05:02:50,600
Oh, ow.

4082
05:02:50,600 --> 05:02:51,880
Ow, he got me.

4083
05:02:51,880 --> 05:02:53,240
Three days off consider.

4084
05:02:53,240 --> 05:02:54,680
I mean, I don't know.

4085
05:02:54,760 --> 05:03:01,320
I think for me, for my standard is like three days off is like,

4086
05:03:01,320 --> 05:03:03,000
yeah, I would get tons of stuff done,

4087
05:03:04,440 --> 05:03:07,640
but I don't know if I would, like, mess it up.

4088
05:03:11,160 --> 05:03:13,960
Just let it ink one more time before you go, though.

4089
05:03:13,960 --> 05:03:16,600
A little serotonin boost before it's all gone.

4090
05:03:17,800 --> 05:03:19,400
We can always post the video and take it.

4091
05:03:19,400 --> 05:03:22,680
Yeah, like, I think if I were to do anything,

4092
05:03:23,240 --> 05:03:26,520
if I could feel myself bubble into the surface and be like,

4093
05:03:26,520 --> 05:03:27,480
right, that's me done.

4094
05:03:28,280 --> 05:03:30,760
I need, like, a few days off.

4095
05:03:30,760 --> 05:03:33,720
I could definitely, in exchange, do, like,

4096
05:03:33,720 --> 05:03:36,920
I could record gameplay of me playing, like, a round of balutril.

4097
05:03:38,520 --> 05:03:40,680
And it's just me, like, going absolutely 8 checks.

4098
05:03:40,680 --> 05:03:42,840
I'm so happy that I won it, basically.

4099
05:03:42,840 --> 05:03:44,120
I bet I did it on my own.

4100
05:03:44,120 --> 05:03:44,680
Did you see?

4101
05:03:44,680 --> 05:03:45,240
Did you see?

4102
05:03:45,240 --> 05:03:46,360
I won on my own.

4103
05:03:46,360 --> 05:03:48,440
I didn't need you guys to do all the math for me.

4104
05:03:48,440 --> 05:03:49,000
I cheated.

4105
05:03:49,240 --> 05:03:54,200
And, like, I can record, like, the ASMRs and edit them.

4106
05:03:54,200 --> 05:03:56,520
Like, this isn't a problem if I did take time off.

4107
05:03:57,400 --> 05:04:02,440
I mean, at the rate I'm going, I'm still okay.

4108
05:04:04,360 --> 05:04:05,160
You know?

4109
05:04:05,160 --> 05:04:06,120
It's still gonna work.

4110
05:04:07,160 --> 05:04:11,320
But I'll let you go, and I'll get your opinions and feedback and stuff.

4111
05:04:11,320 --> 05:04:12,600
But I do...

4112
05:04:13,800 --> 05:04:17,720
The two hour streams is weird as it was not being online for two hours.

4113
05:04:18,680 --> 05:04:19,800
More than two hours.

4114
05:04:20,680 --> 05:04:24,920
I might incorporate them slightly more.

4115
05:04:24,920 --> 05:04:26,840
I'm gonna, I'm testing them out next month.

4116
05:04:26,840 --> 05:04:29,000
You're gonna know exactly what ones I'm talking about.

4117
05:04:30,360 --> 05:04:31,800
There's a new Deadpool movie?

4118
05:04:31,800 --> 05:04:34,280
Off to go see the new Deadpool movie.

4119
05:04:34,280 --> 05:04:36,680
Gonna watch the rest of stream tonight.

4120
05:04:36,680 --> 05:04:39,800
BTW, it's Stephen Burns like Stephen Hillberg.

4121
05:04:39,800 --> 05:04:42,920
I don't know how Stephen Hillberg is said.

4122
05:04:43,880 --> 05:04:45,160
Stephen?

4123
05:04:45,880 --> 05:04:46,680
Stefan?

4124
05:04:47,800 --> 05:04:48,520
Stephen?

4125
05:04:49,640 --> 05:04:50,360
Thank you for the tip.

4126
05:04:50,360 --> 05:04:52,200
I hope you enjoyed Deadpool, by the way.

4127
05:04:52,200 --> 05:04:53,480
I didn't realize I had a new one.

4128
05:04:54,920 --> 05:04:56,040
Smelly today.

4129
05:04:56,040 --> 05:04:59,320
Absolutely sweating and putrid, my good sir.

4130
05:04:59,320 --> 05:05:01,400
I've been nonstop sweating on this game.

4131
05:05:01,400 --> 05:05:02,280
Not even kidding.

4132
05:05:02,280 --> 05:05:03,320
Thank you, Cluffy Nutter.

4133
05:05:03,960 --> 05:05:06,200
And thank you, Stephen, Stephen.

4134
05:05:06,200 --> 05:05:11,560
I'm just gonna say all variations until, you know, one of them works.

4135
05:05:11,560 --> 05:05:13,400
Like Stephen with a V, right?

4136
05:05:14,360 --> 05:05:15,160
Yeah, see?

4137
05:05:15,160 --> 05:05:19,720
I'm so sorry, but you know how you literally put Stephen with a V?

4138
05:05:21,480 --> 05:05:22,680
I don't mean it in a mean way.

4139
05:05:22,680 --> 05:05:23,480
I'm telling you.

4140
05:05:23,480 --> 05:05:25,560
Strani, take off three days.

4141
05:05:26,120 --> 05:05:29,160
Get five months of work done in those three days.

4142
05:05:29,720 --> 05:05:31,880
Didn't relax any moment of it.

4143
05:05:31,880 --> 05:05:34,040
Right, that's a little, one, anonymous.

4144
05:05:34,040 --> 05:05:35,400
Don't call me out like that.

4145
05:05:35,400 --> 05:05:37,320
Cause two, that's a little too,

4146
05:05:37,320 --> 05:05:39,720
that's a little too on the nose of exactly what would happen.

4147
05:05:40,280 --> 05:05:43,080
I would wake up later than stream time.

4148
05:05:44,200 --> 05:05:49,480
And then, I can't believe you said the quiet part out loud.

4149
05:05:49,480 --> 05:05:50,440
Why would you do that to me?

4150
05:05:50,440 --> 05:05:51,720
You've just embarrassed me.

4151
05:05:51,720 --> 05:05:52,840
Did I look at this?

4152
05:05:52,840 --> 05:05:53,400
I think so.

4153
05:05:54,760 --> 05:05:55,640
Oh no, there's more.

4154
05:05:57,480 --> 05:05:58,600
Hydration break.

4155
05:05:58,600 --> 05:05:59,800
Let me finish my water.

4156
05:05:59,800 --> 05:06:01,640
Cause I think this is it, Rieflin.

4157
05:06:05,160 --> 05:06:06,680
Rames with even, Stephen.

4158
05:06:08,040 --> 05:06:08,680
Yeah.

4159
05:06:08,680 --> 05:06:09,560
Yeah, see?

4160
05:06:09,560 --> 05:06:10,280
See?

4161
05:06:10,280 --> 05:06:10,920
I got it.

4162
05:06:10,920 --> 05:06:11,960
I'm sorry.

4163
05:06:11,960 --> 05:06:12,760
I did it.

4164
05:06:12,760 --> 05:06:15,240
In my defense, in the English language,

4165
05:06:15,240 --> 05:06:17,800
a pH maker F sound, okay?

4166
05:06:17,800 --> 05:06:19,080
So don't blame me.

4167
05:06:19,080 --> 05:06:21,160
Spank your own morn, your paw, okay?

4168
05:06:21,160 --> 05:06:21,880
Don't spank me.

4169
05:06:21,880 --> 05:06:22,440
Spank them.

4170
05:06:24,280 --> 05:06:25,720
Mommy's too much in love with her.

4171
05:06:25,720 --> 05:06:27,080
And too much of a workaholic.

4172
05:06:29,080 --> 05:06:29,640
Okay.

4173
05:06:30,280 --> 05:06:33,480
Let's just say once I've dealt with my 100

4174
05:06:33,480 --> 05:06:35,960
VTuber collab series, if you want to call it that,

4175
05:06:36,760 --> 05:06:41,400
and my 100 ASMR, thank you, reward goal.

4176
05:06:41,400 --> 05:06:43,400
Things will be just that.

4177
05:06:44,120 --> 05:06:45,320
Things will be just that.

4178
05:06:47,800 --> 05:06:49,320
That's going to be nice all of all.

4179
05:06:50,840 --> 05:06:51,800
Cause you stream all the time.

4180
05:06:51,800 --> 05:06:52,840
We know you're everywhere.

4181
05:06:57,000 --> 05:07:01,400
Her Frodo, he's absolutely just gone by this point.

4182
05:07:03,480 --> 05:07:05,240
Yeah, look at, oh no.

4183
05:07:05,320 --> 05:07:06,520
He's so lifty.

4184
05:07:06,520 --> 05:07:08,040
Look at the way he's walking.

4185
05:07:09,880 --> 05:07:10,280
If you don't-

4186
05:07:10,280 --> 05:07:10,840
If you don't-

4187
05:07:10,840 --> 05:07:11,340
Oh.

4188
05:07:11,340 --> 05:07:13,240
For a while, we will be in the trenches.

4189
05:07:13,240 --> 05:07:15,480
I promise to take care of my fellow brothers

4190
05:07:15,480 --> 05:07:15,800
for you.

4191
05:07:15,800 --> 05:07:17,240
You have my words, mommy.

4192
05:07:18,040 --> 05:07:19,480
I don't want everyone throwing up

4193
05:07:19,480 --> 05:07:21,400
and being upset that I'm not online.

4194
05:07:22,440 --> 05:07:23,640
It's not happened yet.

4195
05:07:23,640 --> 05:07:25,080
I'm not at my point yet.

4196
05:07:26,120 --> 05:07:27,480
But I will let you know, like,

4197
05:07:27,480 --> 05:07:29,560
I'm not really going to hide it if I'm not well.

4198
05:07:29,560 --> 05:07:33,400
I don't want to, like, I don't, you know,

4199
05:07:33,400 --> 05:07:34,600
I don't have to rant about

4200
05:07:35,560 --> 05:07:36,680
it.

4201
05:07:36,680 --> 05:07:38,840
Sorry, I just got absolutely walloped.

4202
05:07:38,840 --> 05:07:40,120
I didn't know I expected that.

4203
05:07:42,920 --> 05:07:43,880
Sorry, I need you to-

4204
05:07:49,000 --> 05:07:51,000
Thank you, reverse, for the super chat.

4205
05:07:52,040 --> 05:07:54,200
Frodo, it's like he's missing mommy too.

4206
05:07:54,200 --> 05:07:56,440
Like, I'll tell you if it ever gets too much,

4207
05:07:56,440 --> 05:07:59,800
but like, put it this way,

4208
05:07:59,800 --> 05:08:02,840
she be quite literally said in the group chat,

4209
05:08:03,640 --> 05:08:06,600
Strone, in the meeting, sorry.

4210
05:08:07,480 --> 05:08:08,920
She literally said, like,

4211
05:08:08,920 --> 05:08:11,320
Strone, you need to be careful.

4212
05:08:11,320 --> 05:08:13,720
And I'm like, yeah, you know what,

4213
05:08:13,720 --> 05:08:15,000
you know what, that's true.

4214
05:08:15,000 --> 05:08:15,720
That's true.

4215
05:08:15,720 --> 05:08:16,760
You're kind of right.

4216
05:08:16,760 --> 05:08:19,320
And I'm like, okay, I don't know.

4217
05:08:20,120 --> 05:08:22,280
I'd really, I just really like the idea

4218
05:08:22,280 --> 05:08:23,880
of streaming every single day, though.

4219
05:08:23,880 --> 05:08:26,040
Like, I want that to be, like,

4220
05:08:26,040 --> 05:08:28,520
one of the insane accolades of this,

4221
05:08:29,720 --> 05:08:31,480
you know, that I managed to achieve.

4222
05:08:31,560 --> 05:08:35,400
Like, I streamed every single day type thing.

4223
05:08:35,400 --> 05:08:36,680
And then I worked behind the scenes

4224
05:08:36,680 --> 05:08:38,200
every single day type thing, you know?

4225
05:08:40,760 --> 05:08:42,680
If you knock that over, you get a little chest.

4226
05:08:43,880 --> 05:08:45,320
I don't know how you're supposed to figure out

4227
05:08:45,320 --> 05:08:46,360
on your own, but there you go.

4228
05:08:47,080 --> 05:08:48,280
Everyone needs a Sam.

4229
05:08:48,840 --> 05:08:50,440
You're my Sam, refling.

4230
05:08:53,080 --> 05:08:54,600
Weird, rather, if you did three arrests,

4231
05:08:54,600 --> 05:08:55,960
then you burned out.

4232
05:08:55,960 --> 05:08:58,440
I don't, oh, see, this is where I'm like,

4233
05:08:58,440 --> 05:09:01,320
I don't get burned out the way people describe it.

4234
05:09:01,320 --> 05:09:02,520
I get tired.

4235
05:09:02,520 --> 05:09:03,320
Don't get me wrong.

4236
05:09:03,320 --> 05:09:04,920
I get, I'm a tired bean.

4237
05:09:07,080 --> 05:09:09,080
But like, the terminology burnt out.

4238
05:09:09,080 --> 05:09:10,520
I'm like, if I'm burnt out,

4239
05:09:10,520 --> 05:09:11,880
just pick a game that I like.

4240
05:09:11,880 --> 05:09:13,800
Like, I'm rearing to go against Sam.

4241
05:09:13,800 --> 05:09:14,600
Are you coming over?

4242
05:09:14,600 --> 05:09:16,040
Okay, yeah, come on.

4243
05:09:16,040 --> 05:09:16,680
Oh, he did it.

4244
05:09:16,680 --> 05:09:17,000
He did it.

4245
05:09:17,000 --> 05:09:17,880
He's fine, he's fine.

4246
05:09:21,080 --> 05:09:23,080
Like, if I ever felt burnt out,

4247
05:09:23,080 --> 05:09:25,000
I think it's just because I'm being shite, you know?

4248
05:09:26,040 --> 05:09:27,800
I'm a me, hi, people.

4249
05:09:27,800 --> 05:09:29,160
Sam, please come through the tunnel.

4250
05:09:29,160 --> 05:09:30,200
Hi, Mama.

4251
05:09:30,200 --> 05:09:33,560
I just got back from work and I'm glad to be here.

4252
05:09:33,560 --> 05:09:35,000
I hope you're doing well,

4253
05:09:35,000 --> 05:09:37,320
and if not, I'd like you to take some time

4254
05:09:37,320 --> 05:09:37,960
for yourself every now and then.

4255
05:09:37,960 --> 05:09:39,800
Thank you very much, Flashpower.

4256
05:09:39,800 --> 05:09:40,840
I hope you enjoyed your work.

4257
05:09:42,200 --> 05:09:45,560
Wait a minute, you just finished work.

4258
05:09:46,680 --> 05:09:49,240
Did you send that while doing your post-work job?

4259
05:09:49,240 --> 05:09:50,120
I dare you.

4260
05:09:50,120 --> 05:09:50,840
I'm on to you.

4261
05:09:51,640 --> 05:09:52,200
I'm on to you.

4262
05:09:52,200 --> 05:09:53,000
How dare you do that?

4263
05:09:54,760 --> 05:09:56,440
Thank you very much, though, for the super chat.

4264
05:09:56,440 --> 05:09:58,600
And let me pop in your super chat chair.

4265
05:09:58,600 --> 05:09:59,880
Yank my now.

4266
05:09:59,880 --> 05:10:00,840
Thanks for your boy chair.

4267
05:10:04,040 --> 05:10:05,720
Short streams, counter streams as well.

4268
05:10:05,720 --> 05:10:06,520
Yes.

4269
05:10:06,520 --> 05:10:08,760
The only problem is there's not many games

4270
05:10:08,760 --> 05:10:11,160
that interest me that are super short.

4271
05:10:11,160 --> 05:10:13,560
I'm like, so when my dad was here,

4272
05:10:13,560 --> 05:10:16,920
we played like Sa-ku-i-ya.

4273
05:10:22,920 --> 05:10:23,400
Wait, what's going on here?

4274
05:10:23,560 --> 05:10:27,880
I don't know what I need to do with you.

4275
05:10:27,880 --> 05:10:28,840
We need to go off?

4276
05:10:31,240 --> 05:10:34,120
And what would Sam being up here do for me?

4277
05:10:34,120 --> 05:10:34,600
I don't know.

4278
05:10:37,000 --> 05:10:38,280
Oh, he can do something ahead.

4279
05:10:39,800 --> 05:10:42,600
Yeah, like those short two-hour streams,

4280
05:10:42,600 --> 05:10:46,200
the wham-bam things, I've definitely got more of those

4281
05:10:46,200 --> 05:10:49,080
planned like ASMR streams or two-hour wham-bam.

4282
05:10:49,080 --> 05:10:52,840
Sa-plan-pou-moi.

4283
05:10:52,840 --> 05:10:55,480
Sorry, that song has wham-bam, motoplan.

4284
05:11:00,520 --> 05:11:03,800
I think I may have a few more of those planned.

4285
05:11:03,800 --> 05:11:05,960
Like originally I was going to play Shadow of War,

4286
05:11:05,960 --> 05:11:07,240
but I'm a bit nervous.

4287
05:11:07,240 --> 05:11:09,400
It's going to go pish, wakafo-ish.

4288
05:11:10,520 --> 05:11:12,280
And I'm sorry, I didn't want that.

4289
05:11:13,800 --> 05:11:15,400
Let's get you over here.

4290
05:11:17,160 --> 05:11:18,600
All right, and then you go on that.

4291
05:11:19,080 --> 05:11:20,360
And then I'll push you over.

4292
05:11:22,120 --> 05:11:24,680
And then you're going to go behind.

4293
05:11:25,880 --> 05:11:26,920
And then you're going to do this.

4294
05:11:29,560 --> 05:11:31,560
Okay, but wait a minute.

4295
05:11:31,560 --> 05:11:33,400
Why is the camera angle so tight?

4296
05:11:34,120 --> 05:11:36,440
It needs to, maybe there's something hidden

4297
05:11:37,000 --> 05:11:39,400
at the bottom of the map right here.

4298
05:11:39,400 --> 05:11:41,240
Oh, how did I know?

4299
05:11:41,240 --> 05:11:42,600
It's fine, I'm just so able to do.

4300
05:11:42,600 --> 05:11:43,800
I just know everything about this game.

4301
05:11:45,000 --> 05:11:45,720
Can you jump up?

4302
05:11:45,720 --> 05:11:46,200
Thank you.

4303
05:11:47,000 --> 05:11:48,440
And then we're going to go up the top.

4304
05:11:48,440 --> 05:11:49,800
And we're going to go beat up Gollum.

4305
05:11:51,720 --> 05:11:52,840
Wham-bam, thank you, ma'am.

4306
05:11:55,400 --> 05:11:57,880
Okay, now we're going to go beat Gollum up,

4307
05:11:57,880 --> 05:11:58,680
because he's up here.

4308
05:12:00,440 --> 05:12:03,320
Those games are short and they have easy moves.

4309
05:12:04,120 --> 05:12:05,480
Hello, leggy, stroney.

4310
05:12:05,480 --> 05:12:06,440
Did you like my thumb?

4311
05:12:06,440 --> 05:12:06,840
Oh!

4312
05:12:07,400 --> 05:12:08,360
Come on, Mr. Portal.

4313
05:12:09,560 --> 05:12:11,400
Oh, no, that's what always makes me cry as well.

4314
05:12:12,200 --> 05:12:13,160
But I can fly.

4315
05:12:13,160 --> 05:12:14,040
But I can't carry you.

4316
05:12:15,000 --> 05:12:15,800
Come on!

4317
05:12:18,680 --> 05:12:20,120
Oh, my God, Sam.

4318
05:12:34,280 --> 05:12:35,960
No, Gollum, not no.

4319
05:12:37,160 --> 05:12:39,960
So, because we're so weakened right now,

4320
05:12:39,960 --> 05:12:42,200
Gollum can technically take us on.

4321
05:12:43,160 --> 05:12:46,280
You know, lack of food, lack of just everything.

4322
05:12:48,760 --> 05:12:50,840
You're a cheeky sod, you are, Gollum.

4323
05:12:50,840 --> 05:12:51,480
You really are.

4324
05:12:53,640 --> 05:12:54,200
What did I do?

4325
05:12:54,840 --> 05:12:55,880
I threw a rock at him.

4326
05:12:55,880 --> 05:12:56,680
Fuck you, Peach.

4327
05:12:58,040 --> 05:13:01,160
Sorry, that was really funny the way he just accepted that.

4328
05:13:02,280 --> 05:13:03,880
Just the rock being tossed at him.

4329
05:13:06,120 --> 05:13:07,400
Fuck you, Peach.

4330
05:13:07,400 --> 05:13:09,240
No, we can't both be throwing rocks at each other.

4331
05:13:09,240 --> 05:13:10,360
Only I can throw the rocks.

4332
05:13:10,760 --> 05:13:13,800
No, don't throw them at me.

4333
05:13:13,800 --> 05:13:14,760
I'll throw them at you.

4334
05:13:14,760 --> 05:13:15,560
Fuck you.

4335
05:13:15,560 --> 05:13:16,840
No, you're too far away.

4336
05:13:16,840 --> 05:13:18,760
Okay, Frodo has to angle it correctly.

4337
05:13:19,640 --> 05:13:20,760
No, take that.

4338
05:13:20,760 --> 05:13:22,280
Yeah, take that, you little shit.

4339
05:13:23,880 --> 05:13:25,000
Ah, get off of me.

4340
05:13:27,240 --> 05:13:28,360
Fuck you, Peach.

4341
05:13:28,360 --> 05:13:31,560
Oh, I imagine trying to fend off

4342
05:13:31,560 --> 05:13:33,320
when you just fall into the lava.

4343
05:13:33,320 --> 05:13:34,120
Oh, my gosh.

4344
05:13:38,520 --> 05:13:39,560
Okay, now what?

4345
05:13:39,640 --> 05:13:40,680
Fuck you, no.

4346
05:13:41,560 --> 05:13:42,680
Fuck you, Peach.

4347
05:13:47,640 --> 05:13:49,000
Uh, and Peach.

4348
05:13:53,720 --> 05:13:55,560
Get off of me, Gollum.

4349
05:13:55,560 --> 05:13:56,600
You stinky boy.

4350
05:13:57,480 --> 05:13:58,360
Run, Frodo.

4351
05:13:59,400 --> 05:14:00,680
Run, Frodo, you can do it.

4352
05:14:03,480 --> 05:14:04,360
No, no, no, no.

4353
05:14:04,360 --> 05:14:05,800
Drop it, drop it, drop it.

4354
05:14:06,760 --> 05:14:07,880
Destroy it.

4355
05:14:09,160 --> 05:14:09,880
Not again.

4356
05:14:11,080 --> 05:14:12,440
The ring is mine.

4357
05:14:12,440 --> 05:14:12,920
No.

4358
05:14:15,480 --> 05:14:15,960
No.

4359
05:14:18,920 --> 05:14:20,920
That's not the fly report to knock him out.

4360
05:14:31,720 --> 05:14:33,640
Okay, so Frodo and Gollum

4361
05:14:33,640 --> 05:14:35,720
and are fighting in the motherfucking ring world.

4362
05:14:37,320 --> 05:14:39,960
And then I need to go to fucking Sam

4363
05:14:39,960 --> 05:14:41,560
and smack him with a frying pan.

4364
05:14:43,480 --> 05:14:43,960
We are.

4365
05:14:44,920 --> 05:14:48,680
Okay, and then he'll make me drop off the map

4366
05:14:48,680 --> 05:14:49,560
at these segments.

4367
05:14:51,000 --> 05:14:52,600
And then I think we did it.

4368
05:14:56,520 --> 05:14:58,200
Definitely do not want to fall

4369
05:14:58,200 --> 05:15:00,040
into the crispy cavern below.

4370
05:15:01,160 --> 05:15:03,560
You know, I don't want to get

4371
05:15:03,560 --> 05:15:05,160
turned into human jerky.

4372
05:15:07,880 --> 05:15:08,840
And then we do this.

4373
05:15:10,600 --> 05:15:12,200
And then you have to manually jump up

4374
05:15:12,200 --> 05:15:12,680
with Sam.

4375
05:15:12,680 --> 05:15:15,000
The game won't do it itself, which is annoying

4376
05:15:15,000 --> 05:15:16,840
because I hate parkour in this game.

4377
05:15:16,840 --> 05:15:18,200
And then you can go back to Frodo

4378
05:15:18,200 --> 05:15:19,560
because he's getting attacked again.

4379
05:15:20,680 --> 05:15:22,120
And then you go back to Sam

4380
05:15:22,120 --> 05:15:23,240
and you'll wallop him.

4381
05:15:23,960 --> 05:15:25,080
You beat the absolute.

4382
05:15:26,920 --> 05:15:27,400
Take this.

4383
05:15:28,520 --> 05:15:29,560
No, get back here.

4384
05:15:29,560 --> 05:15:30,520
I'm not done with you yet.

4385
05:15:30,520 --> 05:15:31,880
Get back here, Gollum.

4386
05:15:31,880 --> 05:15:33,640
You stinky piece of cheese.

4387
05:15:34,360 --> 05:15:35,560
And then he jumps on your back

4388
05:15:35,560 --> 05:15:37,480
and you fall off and do it all over again.

4389
05:15:37,480 --> 05:15:39,240
We'll hobbit jerky, honestly.

4390
05:15:42,440 --> 05:15:43,240
I thought you'd like it

4391
05:15:43,240 --> 05:15:44,760
when Gollum jumps you in a minute.

4392
05:15:44,760 --> 05:15:45,240
Munko.

4393
05:15:46,120 --> 05:15:46,600
Gollum?

4394
05:15:46,600 --> 05:15:48,040
You think Gollum's my type?

4395
05:15:48,600 --> 05:15:49,960
Skinny and scrawny.

4396
05:15:51,560 --> 05:15:53,720
Skinny and scrawny for scrawny.

4397
05:15:54,840 --> 05:15:55,720
What's going on here?

4398
05:15:57,240 --> 05:15:58,120
Are you pranking me?

4399
05:16:02,200 --> 05:16:05,880
Okay, I pan.

4400
05:16:07,400 --> 05:16:08,680
It's happening.

4401
05:16:08,680 --> 05:16:09,560
It's happening.

4402
05:16:10,840 --> 05:16:12,280
The end is upon us.

4403
05:16:12,280 --> 05:16:13,400
The end is nice.

4404
05:16:15,880 --> 05:16:16,680
Okay.

4405
05:16:16,680 --> 05:16:18,200
And then we need to help Sam.

4406
05:16:18,200 --> 05:16:19,240
He's getting beaten up again.

4407
05:16:20,600 --> 05:16:22,600
And then, no, sorry, Frodo.

4408
05:16:22,600 --> 05:16:24,120
And then whack him with a frying pan.

4409
05:16:24,760 --> 05:16:25,560
You get off me.

4410
05:16:26,360 --> 05:16:27,720
You get off me.

4411
05:16:27,720 --> 05:16:28,600
You know, boy.

4412
05:16:31,880 --> 05:16:36,920
Gollum, knock it off, buddy.

4413
05:16:36,920 --> 05:16:38,600
Jesus, just leave him be.

4414
05:16:38,600 --> 05:16:39,400
You fellow beast.

4415
05:16:40,920 --> 05:16:42,600
You know not what the harm you cause.

4416
05:16:43,560 --> 05:16:45,000
Okay, okay, yeah.

4417
05:16:47,880 --> 05:16:48,280
Get off.

4418
05:16:50,760 --> 05:16:53,480
We'll build some emergency pieces for Sam.

4419
05:16:55,400 --> 05:16:56,200
And then we'll jump.

4420
05:16:56,920 --> 05:16:57,560
And then we jump.

4421
05:16:57,560 --> 05:16:58,280
And then we jump.

4422
05:16:58,280 --> 05:16:59,080
And then we beat him up.

4423
05:16:59,080 --> 05:16:59,960
Beat him up.

4424
05:16:59,960 --> 05:17:00,520
Beat him up.

4425
05:17:01,480 --> 05:17:02,200
Beat him up.

4426
05:17:02,200 --> 05:17:02,600
Beat him up.

4427
05:17:02,600 --> 05:17:03,320
It's a 1v1.

4428
05:17:05,080 --> 05:17:05,480
Okay.

4429
05:17:08,040 --> 05:17:09,000
Stick his whole hand.

4430
05:17:09,000 --> 05:17:09,880
Anakin style.

4431
05:17:11,080 --> 05:17:11,640
Oh wait, no.

4432
05:17:11,640 --> 05:17:12,280
No, Anakin.

4433
05:17:13,000 --> 05:17:13,560
The sun.

4434
05:17:13,560 --> 05:17:14,680
Luke Skywalker style.

4435
05:17:15,800 --> 05:17:17,400
Oh wait, Anakin doesn't have a hand either.

4436
05:17:18,120 --> 05:17:19,240
They both don't have hands.

4437
05:17:19,240 --> 05:17:20,200
Wait a minute.

4438
05:17:21,320 --> 05:17:22,520
Because one got burnt to a crisp

4439
05:17:22,520 --> 05:17:23,320
and the other got sandpicked.

4440
05:17:26,120 --> 05:17:26,600
Beat him up.

4441
05:17:26,600 --> 05:17:26,840
Beat him up.

4442
05:17:26,840 --> 05:17:27,240
Beat him up.

4443
05:17:27,240 --> 05:17:27,480
Come on.

4444
05:17:28,040 --> 05:17:28,360
Come on.

4445
05:17:28,360 --> 05:17:29,000
Swing that ring.

4446
05:17:29,000 --> 05:17:29,800
Swing that thing.

4447
05:17:31,400 --> 05:17:32,040
Frodo, no.

4448
05:17:33,640 --> 05:17:35,000
Dolan got what he wanted though.

4449
05:17:38,680 --> 05:17:41,080
Imagine being addicted to something so much

4450
05:17:41,080 --> 05:17:42,360
that you do not feel the pain

4451
05:17:42,360 --> 05:17:44,040
of burning hot molten lava.

4452
05:17:44,040 --> 05:17:47,000
That's some real addiction.

4453
05:17:49,080 --> 05:17:51,160
Take that, you stinker tin.

4454
05:17:51,160 --> 05:17:52,520
Leave Middle Earth alone.

4455
05:17:53,960 --> 05:17:56,040
For the age of man is upon us.

4456
05:18:01,480 --> 05:18:02,280
Oh, I love that.

4457
05:18:05,080 --> 05:18:06,040
Frodo did it.

4458
05:18:13,720 --> 05:18:14,600
You did it.

4459
05:18:14,600 --> 05:18:15,160
You did it.

4460
05:18:15,160 --> 05:18:15,640
You did it.

4461
05:18:15,640 --> 05:18:16,280
You did it.

4462
05:18:16,280 --> 05:18:16,760
Oh.

4463
05:18:19,960 --> 05:18:20,680
Forgot about that part.

4464
05:18:20,680 --> 05:18:21,960
I have to go over that part.

4465
05:18:21,960 --> 05:18:22,440
You.

4466
05:18:31,480 --> 05:18:33,320
I know this sweat drop.

4467
05:18:35,640 --> 05:18:36,200
Oh, no.

4468
05:18:36,200 --> 05:18:37,800
Wait, is this a runaway seat?

4469
05:18:37,800 --> 05:18:38,280
Oh, no.

4470
05:18:38,280 --> 05:18:39,480
Is it left or right?

4471
05:18:39,480 --> 05:18:40,360
It has to be the right.

4472
05:18:40,360 --> 05:18:42,040
Oh, no, that far right.

4473
05:18:42,040 --> 05:18:43,320
It has to be the right side.

4474
05:18:43,320 --> 05:18:44,600
Is this a jump one?

4475
05:18:44,600 --> 05:18:45,320
It's a jump one.

4476
05:18:45,320 --> 05:18:45,880
I got it.

4477
05:18:45,880 --> 05:18:46,280
I got it.

4478
05:18:46,280 --> 05:18:47,000
That's all we needed.

4479
05:18:47,640 --> 05:18:48,040
I got it.

4480
05:18:48,040 --> 05:18:49,000
It was a jump one.

4481
05:18:49,000 --> 05:18:49,880
Surely it's on the right.

4482
05:18:49,880 --> 05:18:50,760
Whatever it is.

4483
05:18:50,760 --> 05:18:51,720
If there's anything more.

4484
05:18:52,360 --> 05:18:53,240
Is there anything more?

4485
05:18:54,040 --> 05:18:55,000
It's always on the right.

4486
05:18:55,000 --> 05:18:55,720
Doesn't matter what it is.

4487
05:18:55,720 --> 05:18:56,520
It's always on the right.

4488
05:18:57,400 --> 05:18:58,040
Okay, we did it.

4489
05:18:58,040 --> 05:18:58,440
We did it.

4490
05:18:58,440 --> 05:18:58,920
We're safe.

4491
05:18:59,880 --> 05:19:00,520
Is it?

4492
05:19:00,520 --> 05:19:01,160
Oh, no.

4493
05:19:01,160 --> 05:19:02,200
Maybe it is on the right.

4494
05:19:02,200 --> 05:19:03,080
Hold on a minute.

4495
05:19:03,080 --> 05:19:03,640
Hold on a minute.

4496
05:19:03,640 --> 05:19:04,360
I'm getting nervous.

4497
05:19:05,000 --> 05:19:07,960
I end before the last one is randomly on the left.

4498
05:19:09,960 --> 05:19:12,680
Look at the mountain just getting blown off in the background.

4499
05:19:12,680 --> 05:19:13,400
Okay, we're fine.

4500
05:19:13,400 --> 05:19:13,880
We got it.

4501
05:19:13,880 --> 05:19:14,280
We got it.

4502
05:19:16,200 --> 05:19:17,400
We did it.

4503
05:19:18,040 --> 05:19:19,480
The lava will be overflowing.

4504
05:19:19,480 --> 05:19:19,960
It's gone.

4505
05:19:21,160 --> 05:19:22,280
Yes, Mr. Frodo.

4506
05:19:24,600 --> 05:19:25,480
It's over now.

4507
05:19:29,320 --> 05:19:38,440
It's all like that, people.

4508
05:19:39,560 --> 05:19:40,920
They forgot that third one.

4509
05:19:42,920 --> 05:19:44,600
Unplayable 0 out of 10.

4510
05:19:47,800 --> 05:19:48,920
Don't pass out now.

4511
05:19:48,920 --> 05:19:51,080
Yeah, I'd be pretty exhausted if I were you.

4512
05:19:51,080 --> 05:19:51,800
Not gonna lie.

4513
05:19:52,680 --> 05:19:53,800
Eagle girl for gent-

4514
05:19:53,800 --> 05:19:54,920
Oh, okay.

4515
05:19:54,920 --> 05:19:55,400
You win.

4516
05:19:58,920 --> 05:20:09,480
Now come the days of the king.

4517
05:20:11,080 --> 05:20:14,600
Oh, he'll flank them.

4518
05:20:18,120 --> 05:20:18,520
Yeah.

4519
05:20:20,440 --> 05:20:21,560
He's the king.

4520
05:20:22,920 --> 05:20:23,640
You did it.

4521
05:20:24,440 --> 05:20:26,280
Oh, the horsey horsey come in too.

4522
05:20:26,280 --> 05:20:26,920
He's happy.

4523
05:20:29,160 --> 05:20:38,840
This day does not belong to one man, but to all.

4524
05:20:46,360 --> 05:20:47,480
You bow to no one.

4525
05:20:53,480 --> 05:20:55,400
Your heart efforts didn't go away.

4526
05:20:57,160 --> 05:20:58,680
You did it.

4527
05:20:59,560 --> 05:21:00,040
You did it.

4528
05:21:03,160 --> 05:21:04,920
Frodo weary unlocked.

4529
05:21:04,920 --> 05:21:08,360
I mean, I'm not sure we want weary, but sure.

4530
05:21:09,800 --> 05:21:11,400
I lie your words save the day.

4531
05:21:12,200 --> 05:21:14,840
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

4532
05:21:16,360 --> 05:21:19,000
I know everyone is unlockable end game.

4533
05:21:20,520 --> 05:21:21,640
We did it.

4534
05:21:23,800 --> 05:21:25,960
I'm so upset when my musicians only skinny refund.

4535
05:21:26,600 --> 05:21:28,520
You'll never guess what feeder of them is.

4536
05:21:28,520 --> 05:21:30,120
You're going to shit your pantyloons.

4537
05:21:31,800 --> 05:21:32,920
Pallet swap character.

4538
05:21:33,560 --> 05:21:34,040
Pretty much.

4539
05:21:35,480 --> 05:21:37,960
Although his ability is he can move less.

4540
05:21:46,920 --> 05:21:47,080
What?

4541
05:21:50,120 --> 05:21:51,880
Why are you giving me money for play?

4542
05:21:53,720 --> 05:21:55,400
Thank you for the 100.

4543
05:21:55,400 --> 05:21:56,120
That's big.

4544
05:21:57,240 --> 05:21:57,880
Thank you.

4545
05:21:58,760 --> 05:21:59,880
Finish story.

4546
05:22:00,520 --> 05:22:01,880
Let's see what the cutscene is.

4547
05:22:04,680 --> 05:22:06,440
Is there no cutscene to wrap it up?

4548
05:22:07,080 --> 05:22:07,880
Don't do that to me.

4549
05:22:07,880 --> 05:22:09,000
There's no cutscene.

4550
05:22:09,000 --> 05:22:10,520
Thank you, add on for the hundreds.

4551
05:22:10,520 --> 05:22:12,360
Johnny's heart efforts didn't go away.

4552
05:22:12,360 --> 05:22:14,280
No, we steamrolled the campaign.

4553
05:22:16,120 --> 05:22:17,880
Is there actually no cutscene?

4554
05:22:17,880 --> 05:22:18,520
There must be.

4555
05:22:18,520 --> 05:22:19,320
There has to be.

4556
05:22:19,320 --> 05:22:22,120
It's not just going to plot me in after all of that.

4557
05:22:23,800 --> 05:22:24,760
Chad refling.

4558
05:22:25,880 --> 05:22:27,400
Thank you again for the 100.

4559
05:22:28,920 --> 05:22:30,360
It's generous.

4560
05:22:30,360 --> 05:22:31,480
You'll be too generous.

4561
05:22:31,480 --> 05:22:32,440
I'm getting suspicious.

4562
05:22:33,080 --> 05:22:34,280
What are you expecting?

4563
05:22:35,560 --> 05:22:38,040
How do I repay you for this kind of money?

4564
05:22:41,560 --> 05:22:43,400
We depart with a million.

4565
05:22:43,400 --> 05:22:45,000
Cutscene locked behind a hundred percent.

4566
05:22:46,280 --> 05:22:47,800
Are you trolling or is that real?

4567
05:22:49,160 --> 05:22:50,120
Why are you so cute?

4568
05:22:50,920 --> 05:22:51,960
It's the autism.

4569
05:22:54,600 --> 05:22:57,080
And now you find are you really the best myth or item?

4570
05:22:57,080 --> 05:22:57,960
The firework.

4571
05:22:58,840 --> 05:23:00,120
Because it blows stuff up.

4572
05:23:02,440 --> 05:23:04,680
Is there not a Valinor cutscene?

4573
05:23:04,680 --> 05:23:06,680
I thought maybe there was like a boat scene.

4574
05:23:07,400 --> 05:23:10,760
You know, you know the whole sad ending on the boat?

4575
05:23:10,760 --> 05:23:12,760
Did they never put that in the question mark?

4576
05:23:13,960 --> 05:23:15,000
Surely they did.

4577
05:23:15,000 --> 05:23:15,480
Copying.

4578
05:23:16,040 --> 05:23:16,840
Surely they did.

4579
05:23:18,600 --> 05:23:20,040
Michael Roberts.

4580
05:23:20,040 --> 05:23:20,600

4581
05:23:21,320 --> 05:23:22,040

4599
05:23:35,000 --> 05:23:36,200
Paul.

4600
05:23:36,200 --> 05:23:36,920
Ewan.

4601
05:23:36,920 --> 05:23:37,480
Stewart.

4602
05:23:37,480 --> 05:23:38,040
Duncan.

4603
05:23:38,040 --> 05:23:38,440
Richard.

4604
05:23:38,440 --> 05:23:38,680
Ellie.

4605
05:23:38,680 --> 05:23:40,520
How could I thank you all for putting this together?

4606
05:23:40,520 --> 05:23:40,920
David.

4607
05:23:40,920 --> 05:23:41,480
Craig.

4608
05:23:41,480 --> 05:23:41,880
Neil.

4609
05:23:41,880 --> 05:23:42,600
Sean.

4610
05:23:42,600 --> 05:23:42,920
Adam.

4611
05:23:43,560 --> 05:23:43,960

4622
05:23:54,680 --> 05:23:55,160
Stefan.

4623
05:23:55,160 --> 05:23:55,960
Good luck.

4624
05:23:55,960 --> 05:23:56,760
Thomas.

4625
05:23:56,760 --> 05:23:57,640
Tim.

4626
05:23:57,640 --> 05:23:58,440
Another Stephen.

4627
05:23:59,320 --> 05:23:59,640
Something.

4628
05:24:00,520 --> 05:24:01,160
Another Mark.

4629
05:24:01,160 --> 05:24:01,720

05:24:03,800 --> 05:24:03,960
A.

4637
05:24:03,960 --> 05:24:04,200
Tom.

4638
05:24:04,200 --> 05:24:04,360
A.

4639
05:24:04,360 --> 05:24:04,680
James.

4640
05:24:04,680 --> 05:24:05,080
Stewart.

4641
05:24:06,840 --> 05:24:07,400
An Emma.

4642
05:24:07,400 --> 05:24:07,800
Robin.

4643
05:24:07,800 --> 05:24:07,880
A.

4644
05:24:07,880 --> 05:24:08,280
Richie.

4645
05:24:08,280 --> 05:24:08,360
A.

4646
05:24:08,360 --> 05:24:08,680
James.

4647
05:24:08,680 --> 05:24:08,840
A.

4648
05:24:08,840 --> 05:24:09,160
Joe.

4649
05:24:10,520 --> 05:24:11,000
Christian.

4650
05:24:11,000 --> 05:24:11,640
A.

4651
05:24:11,640 --> 05:24:11,960
Chris.

4652
05:24:12,520 --> 05:24:13,080
An Abbey.

05:24:13,480 --> 05:24:13,640
Stewart.

4655
05:24:13,640 --> 05:24:14,040
How could I?

4656
05:24:14,040 --> 05:24:14,600
How could I?

4657
05:24:14,600 --> 05:24:15,640
How could I?

4658
05:24:15,640 --> 05:24:17,000
Yeah, I'll wave at this without you guys.

4659
05:24:17,720 --> 05:24:19,080
How could I fall in love?

4660
05:24:19,080 --> 05:24:21,080
I said Carl's so wrong there.

4661
05:24:21,720 --> 05:24:24,280
I was like, uh, the disco fail?

4662
05:24:24,280 --> 05:24:24,760
Oh, okay.

4663
05:24:26,840 --> 05:24:27,240
How?

4664
05:24:27,240 --> 05:24:29,560
How could we do this without all of you?

4665
05:24:29,560 --> 05:24:30,040
Bob.

4666
05:24:31,000 --> 05:24:31,640
What's your name?

4667
05:24:31,640 --> 05:24:31,800
B.

4668
05:24:31,800 --> 05:24:31,960
O.

4669
05:24:31,960 --> 05:24:32,120
B.

4670
05:24:32,120 --> 05:24:33,160
So they call on you.

4671
05:24:33,160 --> 05:24:33,640
Bob.

4672
05:24:35,720 --> 05:24:37,800
Others call him Tim.

4673
05:24:38,760 --> 05:24:39,400
Carl.

4674
05:24:40,680 --> 05:24:41,240
Carl.

4675
05:24:42,760 --> 05:24:44,040
What now, Strane?

4676
05:24:44,040 --> 05:24:44,920
What do you mean?

4677
05:24:44,920 --> 05:24:46,600
Now we get to play the game

4678
05:24:46,600 --> 05:24:47,960
because we get to the free mode.

4679
05:24:48,840 --> 05:24:51,720
But I'm going to save it for tomorrow

4680
05:24:51,720 --> 05:24:53,640
because I'm a bit emotionally drained today.

4681
05:24:54,440 --> 05:24:55,240
I can't believe it.

4682
05:24:55,240 --> 05:24:56,520
I can't believe I'm emotionally drained.

4683
05:24:56,520 --> 05:24:57,800
I can't believe I'm a human.

4684
05:24:57,800 --> 05:25:01,480
I'm only human after all.

4685
05:25:01,480 --> 05:25:02,840
I'm only human.

4686
05:25:03,480 --> 05:25:04,200
Bob the Builder.

4687
05:25:04,200 --> 05:25:05,320
He's trying to call.

4688
05:25:05,320 --> 05:25:07,080
Bob the Builder.

4689
05:25:07,080 --> 05:25:09,000
Can she fix it?

4690
05:25:09,000 --> 05:25:10,600
Bob the Builder.

4691
05:25:10,600 --> 05:25:12,600
And she can.

4692
05:25:12,600 --> 05:25:14,520
Scoop Muck and Daisy.

4693
05:25:14,520 --> 05:25:15,560
Join the crew.

4694
05:25:16,280 --> 05:25:19,240
Bob and the gang have so much fun.

4695
05:25:19,880 --> 05:25:23,640
Sign together and have a little fun.

4696
05:25:23,640 --> 05:25:25,400
Bob the Builder.

4697
05:25:25,480 --> 05:25:27,320
Can she fix it?

4698
05:25:27,320 --> 05:25:29,160
Bob the Builder.

4699
05:25:29,160 --> 05:25:30,280
Yes, he can.

4700
05:25:31,640 --> 05:25:32,120
Fuck it.

4701
05:25:32,120 --> 05:25:33,560
All the credits are gone.

4702
05:25:35,160 --> 05:25:37,240
Thank you for always being there.

4703
05:25:37,240 --> 05:25:38,680
Very special thanks to

4704
05:25:38,680 --> 05:25:42,200
Lewis, Connor, Dan, Sam, Tom, and Aaron.

4705
05:25:42,200 --> 05:25:44,680
Or Aaron, depending on Aaron, Aaron, and Aaron.

4706
05:25:45,800 --> 05:25:47,800
TT Games Publishing.

4707
05:25:47,800 --> 05:25:49,640
Thank you for all your hard work

4708
05:25:49,640 --> 05:25:51,560
into the advertisement of this game.

4709
05:25:51,560 --> 05:25:52,760
Though you didn't have to advertise it

4710
05:25:52,760 --> 05:25:53,720
to people like me

4711
05:25:53,720 --> 05:25:55,720
because as soon as you slap Lord of the Rings on it,

4712
05:25:55,720 --> 05:25:57,160
I am sold, amen.

4713
05:25:58,440 --> 05:26:00,120
Lofty and Wendy.

4714
05:26:00,120 --> 05:26:02,840
Oh yeah, Wendy's his wife or something.

4715
05:26:02,840 --> 05:26:05,160
Oh my god, they're making me unlock memories.

4716
05:26:05,160 --> 05:26:07,880
I forgot there was a character like that.

4717
05:26:10,360 --> 05:26:11,320
A-A-Ron.

4718
05:26:12,040 --> 05:26:12,920
It's Aaron.

4719
05:26:12,920 --> 05:26:13,240
No.

4720
05:26:14,680 --> 05:26:15,720
Raphael.

4721
05:26:15,720 --> 05:26:16,680
How could I forget you?

4722
05:26:16,680 --> 05:26:17,640
Fabio.

4723
05:26:17,640 --> 05:26:18,200
Delicious.

4724
05:26:19,240 --> 05:26:19,640
Mike.

4725
05:26:22,040 --> 05:26:22,440
Jack.

4726
05:26:22,920 --> 05:26:23,800
David.

4727
05:26:23,800 --> 05:26:24,120
Ben.

4728
05:26:26,120 --> 05:26:27,080
Big Toby.

4729
05:26:27,080 --> 05:26:27,880
Toby Smith.

4730
05:26:27,880 --> 05:26:29,240
How could we forget?

4731
05:26:29,240 --> 05:26:29,960
Who could we forget?

4732
05:26:29,960 --> 05:26:31,720
We almost forgot what we did before.

4733
05:26:33,560 --> 05:26:34,360
Lego Company.

4734
05:26:35,640 --> 05:26:37,240
Big Jesper for setting it up.

4735
05:26:37,240 --> 05:26:40,040
Darryl for getting all the development approved.

4736
05:26:41,000 --> 05:26:41,640
Pair Nile.

4737
05:26:42,840 --> 05:26:43,400
Yep.

4738
05:26:43,400 --> 05:26:43,880
Sten.

4739
05:26:43,880 --> 05:26:45,400
Mm-mm, fantastic work.

4740
05:26:45,400 --> 05:26:46,200
Big Amanda.

4741
05:26:46,200 --> 05:26:47,320
Big Jacob.

4742
05:26:47,320 --> 05:26:47,960
Big Janny.

4743
05:26:50,120 --> 05:26:50,760
Demetris.

4744
05:26:51,720 --> 05:26:52,040
Yep.

4745
05:26:52,600 --> 05:26:53,480
Raymond, of course.

4746
05:26:53,480 --> 05:26:54,680
How could we forget Raymond?

4747
05:26:55,400 --> 05:26:57,800
Bob the Buildler or Fixit Felix?

4748
05:26:57,800 --> 05:26:58,760
Or Handymanion?

4749
05:27:01,240 --> 05:27:02,440
Fixit Felix.

4750
05:27:03,480 --> 05:27:05,240
Ain't that from Rick Ralph?

4751
05:27:06,520 --> 05:27:07,160
John.

4752
05:27:07,160 --> 05:27:08,200
How could we forget?

4753
05:27:09,080 --> 05:27:11,000
I feel like I'm reading the same names over and over.

4754
05:27:11,000 --> 05:27:12,840
Are they re-putting everyone's names in?

4755
05:27:14,840 --> 05:27:15,400
Baki.

4756
05:27:15,400 --> 05:27:16,120
Fantastic.

4757
05:27:16,120 --> 05:27:16,760
Alicia.

4758
05:27:18,520 --> 05:27:19,720
I'm starting to go mental.

4759
05:27:19,720 --> 05:27:21,080
I think I'm reading the same names.

4760
05:27:21,080 --> 05:27:21,560
Arian.

4761
05:27:22,440 --> 05:27:23,560
Big Lindsay.

4762
05:27:23,560 --> 05:27:24,040
Evelyn.

4763
05:27:26,040 --> 05:27:26,520
Jennifer.

4764
05:27:26,520 --> 05:27:29,320
Oh, why is it the Waman's Department is marketing?

4765
05:27:29,320 --> 05:27:30,760
How curious.

4766
05:27:30,760 --> 05:27:34,440
There's definitely more feminine chick names

4767
05:27:34,440 --> 05:27:35,960
in the marketing department,

4768
05:27:35,960 --> 05:27:38,840
but all the developmental stuff is like majority of guy names.

4769
05:27:38,840 --> 05:27:39,960
Don't think I didn't notice that.

4770
05:27:39,960 --> 05:27:40,920
Public Relations.

4771
05:27:42,600 --> 05:27:43,640
Someone's called Joy.

4772
05:27:44,840 --> 05:27:46,040
Good thing it's not with an I.

4773
05:27:48,200 --> 05:27:48,600
Renny.

4774
05:27:49,400 --> 05:27:49,880
Jennifer.

4775
05:27:49,880 --> 05:27:50,360
Yeah.

4776
05:27:50,360 --> 05:27:51,560
Information Technology.

4777
05:27:51,800 --> 05:27:52,920
Who Information Gatherers?

4778
05:27:53,720 --> 05:27:54,280
Adrienne.

4779
05:27:54,280 --> 05:27:54,760
Joshua.

4780
05:27:56,360 --> 05:27:56,920
Curtis.

4781
05:27:57,880 --> 05:27:58,680
Spencer.

4782
05:27:59,240 --> 05:27:59,720
Stefan.

4783
05:28:01,320 --> 05:28:01,960
Marvin.

4784
05:28:01,960 --> 05:28:02,760
Eric.

4785
05:28:02,760 --> 05:28:03,240
Michael.

4786
05:28:04,680 --> 05:28:05,160
Lurch.

4787
05:28:05,160 --> 05:28:06,840
He got his nickname or anything.

4788
05:28:07,480 --> 05:28:07,960
RJ.

4789
05:28:09,000 --> 05:28:09,560
Sales.

4790
05:28:10,840 --> 05:28:11,640
I'm going mental.

4791
05:28:11,640 --> 05:28:12,840
I've seen these names before.

4792
05:28:12,840 --> 05:28:13,880
I'm getting mucked about.

4793
05:28:14,440 --> 05:28:15,320
What's going on here?

4794
05:28:16,440 --> 05:28:17,400
What's going on here?

4795
05:28:17,960 --> 05:28:19,320
I'm reading all these names before

4796
05:28:19,320 --> 05:28:20,760
because ladies know how to self-lease.

4797
05:28:21,800 --> 05:28:23,560
That was him.

4798
05:28:23,560 --> 05:28:23,960
Not me.

4799
05:28:26,600 --> 05:28:28,920
Yeah, maybe some hours before I go off of course.

4800
05:28:28,920 --> 05:28:29,960
Darling, I can do that.

4801
05:28:30,520 --> 05:28:32,920
And we'll find someone to redirect and to have that feel.

4802
05:28:38,760 --> 05:28:40,520
I won't stay for too long.

4803
05:28:41,400 --> 05:28:44,920
Because I will be brutally honest and say I'm pretty emotionally drained after that mean.

4804
05:28:46,200 --> 05:28:47,720
And also I need a fat ship.

4805
05:28:47,720 --> 05:28:50,440
So, you know, we must.

4806
05:28:51,400 --> 05:28:51,720
Must.

4807
05:28:51,720 --> 05:28:54,760
But tomorrow, basically what happens tomorrow

4808
05:28:54,760 --> 05:28:58,680
is we replay through all the missions and get 100% completion.

4809
05:28:58,680 --> 05:29:00,600
That will be done in one stream.

4810
05:29:00,600 --> 05:29:01,880
I am pretty sure I can do it.

4811
05:29:03,640 --> 05:29:05,720
I was about to ask about Maros too.

4812
05:29:05,720 --> 05:29:06,680
Okay, that worked.

4813
05:29:06,680 --> 05:29:08,120
Yeah, you've been here for five hours.

4814
05:29:08,120 --> 05:29:11,080
Yeah, so I had two hours with the girls.

4815
05:29:11,640 --> 05:29:13,400
And then five hours with you guys.

4816
05:29:13,400 --> 05:29:18,680
And I've got a lot to think about after, you know, what occurred.

4817
05:29:19,640 --> 05:29:20,520
Wow.

4818
05:29:21,720 --> 05:29:22,680
Tired moment.

4819
05:29:22,680 --> 05:29:25,080
Mom is getting sleep soon, maybe.

4820
05:29:26,200 --> 05:29:28,840
As for the reflinks who are on my Patreon again,

4821
05:29:28,840 --> 05:29:30,040
cannot thank you enough.

4822
05:29:30,040 --> 05:29:32,440
I pinky, pinky promise you.

4823
05:29:32,440 --> 05:29:37,080
Can't break a pinky promise that a grooming audio goes up.

4824
05:29:37,080 --> 05:29:38,280
That is a wild sentence.

4825
05:29:39,000 --> 05:29:39,960
It goes up.

4826
05:29:40,680 --> 05:29:44,040
I might take a nap after the stream, but it is going up.

4827
05:29:44,040 --> 05:29:47,640
Before I stream tomorrow, it will be up at some point.

4828
05:29:47,720 --> 05:29:49,080
I can't give you a time.

4829
05:29:49,080 --> 05:29:50,040
I can't give you hours.

4830
05:29:50,040 --> 05:29:53,160
If I fall asleep for a nap, I'm probably going to get four hours of a nap

4831
05:29:53,160 --> 05:29:55,720
and then have them, you know, come back and do all the bedding and stuff.

4832
05:29:55,720 --> 05:29:56,680
Okay.

4833
05:29:56,680 --> 05:30:00,520
Emotional drain to you instead of emotional damage.

4834
05:30:04,280 --> 05:30:06,840
If things go well behind the scenes,

4835
05:30:06,840 --> 05:30:11,800
then the partnership for established click channels will be announced.

4836
05:30:13,320 --> 05:30:17,000
If not, then I will focus on AC's ASMR roleplay,

4837
05:30:17,000 --> 05:30:19,720
because she's been waiting very patiently for me to pop that up.

4838
05:30:19,720 --> 05:30:21,800
Um, so very patient.

4839
05:30:21,800 --> 05:30:24,600
And I'm very paid for anything.

4840
05:30:24,600 --> 05:30:27,400
So as you can see, even though I'm 100% completely the campaign,

4841
05:30:27,400 --> 05:30:29,480
we've only got 23% completion.

4842
05:30:30,200 --> 05:30:31,080
That is blinding.

4843
05:30:31,080 --> 05:30:32,680
Is there really not a cut scene?

4844
05:30:33,720 --> 05:30:35,320
Oh my God, my emotional heart.

4845
05:30:37,000 --> 05:30:39,400
Oh my God, no, there's no cut scene.

4846
05:30:42,840 --> 05:30:45,240
How is my heart supposed to handle this?

4847
05:30:45,480 --> 05:30:48,440
There's no cut scene.

4848
05:30:48,440 --> 05:30:48,760
Right.

4849
05:30:49,640 --> 05:30:51,880
I think if you go back to the Shire,

4850
05:30:52,760 --> 05:30:54,520
you can go talk to Big Bilbo.

4851
05:30:56,600 --> 05:30:58,680
And the story's not even a quarter done.

4852
05:30:58,680 --> 05:31:01,480
I guess you're saying, where does the blue studs take me?

4853
05:31:01,480 --> 05:31:02,360
I have no idea.

4854
05:31:03,880 --> 05:31:04,600
I don't know.

4855
05:31:04,600 --> 05:31:07,240
But anyway, so this is our farm life.

4856
05:31:07,240 --> 05:31:09,320
Everyone's got their own Hobbit Homes.

4857
05:31:09,320 --> 05:31:11,480
Everyone's got lovely flowers outside.

4858
05:31:13,080 --> 05:31:14,920
And it's so beautiful.

4859
05:31:14,920 --> 05:31:16,760
And then we have parties as well.

4860
05:31:17,800 --> 05:31:19,720
We have nice little fairs where we dance.

4861
05:31:19,720 --> 05:31:22,600
And I'll teach you some Scottish waltzes and stuff.

4862
05:31:23,720 --> 05:31:27,960
Our most popular dance is called the Gay Garden.

4863
05:31:29,320 --> 05:31:30,280
I'll teach you.

4864
05:31:30,280 --> 05:31:32,440
And then we all nice to nature.

4865
05:31:32,440 --> 05:31:34,520
And we got all the carrots and all the produce

4866
05:31:34,520 --> 05:31:35,560
for everyone to celebrate.

4867
05:31:35,560 --> 05:31:36,920
And it comes from everyone's garden.

4868
05:31:36,920 --> 05:31:38,760
So we don't have to like, you know.

4869
05:31:39,800 --> 05:31:41,160
But yeah, we have a good time.

4870
05:31:41,960 --> 05:31:44,440
And then we've got a nice river where we can do fishing.

4871
05:31:44,440 --> 05:31:45,800
If we want to casually fish.

4872
05:31:46,440 --> 05:31:49,160
And then at night, we would go back to our house,

4873
05:31:49,160 --> 05:31:51,080
which is over here on the hill.

4874
05:31:52,040 --> 05:31:53,000
That's Rosie.

4875
05:31:53,000 --> 05:31:54,040
That's Sam's wife.

4876
05:31:54,040 --> 05:31:54,760
Hi Rosie.

4877
05:31:55,480 --> 05:31:56,760
That's Samwise's wife.

4878
05:31:56,760 --> 05:31:57,640
Because he has a wife.

4879
05:31:58,280 --> 05:31:59,240
He has a wife, he does.

4880
05:32:01,160 --> 05:32:03,240
And then this is Bag End and Zade.

4881
05:32:03,240 --> 05:32:05,320
And you can create a custom character in here.

4882
05:32:06,200 --> 05:32:08,440
I don't do it because I'm not a foster custom character.

4883
05:32:09,080 --> 05:32:10,760
But yeah, there's Bilbo if you want to buy him.

4884
05:32:10,760 --> 05:32:12,120
I'm going to keep the money for now.

4885
05:32:12,120 --> 05:32:14,360
But there's like the kitchen and all of that jazz.

4886
05:32:15,880 --> 05:32:18,280
Next stream we get 100% cutscene.

4887
05:32:18,280 --> 05:32:19,000
Wait, is that real?

4888
05:32:19,000 --> 05:32:19,960
Or are you guys trolling me?

4889
05:32:21,000 --> 05:32:23,720
I don't remember them being 100% cutscene.

4890
05:32:24,680 --> 05:32:26,280
Yeah, but yeah, we've got our little chimneys.

4891
05:32:26,280 --> 05:32:28,520
So there's like a nice little smell of smoke in the air.

4892
05:32:28,520 --> 05:32:31,800
Not that it's too much, but I might say that's okay.

4893
05:32:32,760 --> 05:32:34,280
Which fantasy world would you live in?

4894
05:32:35,560 --> 05:32:36,520
Hobbiton.

4895
05:32:36,520 --> 05:32:39,000
You know, once all the enemies are defeated type stuff.

4896
05:32:39,960 --> 05:32:41,160
Definitely Hobbiton.

4897
05:32:41,160 --> 05:32:45,480
And like you can also come back at night for the party if you want.

4898
05:32:46,840 --> 05:32:49,000
Because the party's even more impressive at night.

4899
05:32:49,880 --> 05:32:51,000
If it's working.

4900
05:32:51,000 --> 05:32:52,920
Sometimes it doesn't work and that's okay.

4901
05:32:52,920 --> 05:32:53,880
Yeah, there you go.

4902
05:32:53,880 --> 05:32:55,560
You can see the fireworks and stuff.

4903
05:32:55,560 --> 05:32:57,560
And they've got sprinklers for the party at night

4904
05:32:57,560 --> 05:32:58,680
with everyone in Hobbiton.

4905
05:32:59,400 --> 05:32:59,800
See?

4906
05:33:01,240 --> 05:33:03,800
And if you get Sam, you can do this.

4907
05:33:04,840 --> 05:33:05,800
You can set them off.

4908
05:33:07,240 --> 05:33:08,280
Yeah, it's really sweet.

4909
05:33:08,280 --> 05:33:10,040
I think it's a really nice little detail.

4910
05:33:11,720 --> 05:33:14,040
If you come at night time, you can set off fireworks.

4911
05:33:16,920 --> 05:33:17,320
Ta-da!

4912
05:33:18,600 --> 05:33:20,120
And our reward is money.

4913
05:33:21,080 --> 05:33:23,320
And we got a mythril break just for that.

4914
05:33:23,320 --> 05:33:25,400
There's like loads of really cool hidden stuff.

4915
05:33:25,400 --> 05:33:26,440
I think it was very sweet.

4916
05:33:27,400 --> 05:33:29,080
And yeah, everyone's just having a good time.

4917
05:33:30,120 --> 05:33:32,760
I would live if I had a chance to do it.

4918
05:33:32,760 --> 05:33:33,720
I've never seen Lord of the Rings,

4919
05:33:33,720 --> 05:33:35,720
but for some reason I remember someone explaining to me

4920
05:33:35,720 --> 05:33:36,760
why Samwise is gay.

4921
05:33:36,760 --> 05:33:38,280
He's not gay, what the fuck?

4922
05:33:38,280 --> 05:33:40,680
He literally marries a wife and has wings.

4923
05:33:41,960 --> 05:33:46,520
But yeah, I'm flinched out.

4924
05:33:46,520 --> 05:33:47,160
It shouldn't be here.

4925
05:33:47,720 --> 05:33:52,840
Okay, let me safely quit the game, save and exit,

4926
05:33:52,840 --> 05:33:53,560
just to make sure.

4927
05:33:54,120 --> 05:33:56,440
And then I'll look at some marshy-warshy mallows.

4928
05:33:58,280 --> 05:33:59,320
Oh, big stretch!

4929
05:33:59,880 --> 05:34:01,960
Oh, we did it!

4930
05:34:01,960 --> 05:34:02,360
Yep!

4931
05:34:03,480 --> 05:34:05,400
Look, there's Mary and Pippin running.

4932
05:34:05,400 --> 05:34:06,680
The carrots they stole.

4933
05:34:07,400 --> 05:34:08,600
There's Gandalf.

4934
05:34:08,600 --> 05:34:10,360
Why is there a pig fishing in the river?

4935
05:34:10,920 --> 05:34:13,400
Gandalf delivering his fireworks,

4936
05:34:13,400 --> 05:34:14,520
because he's more friendly.

4937
05:34:15,800 --> 05:34:18,040
He has 13 kids, he has four kids.

4938
05:34:18,040 --> 05:34:19,640
I'm seeing conflict and information.

4939
05:34:19,640 --> 05:34:20,360
What's going on here?

4940
05:34:23,080 --> 05:34:26,360
Everyone knows that Smashing Clown's the gay-

4941
05:34:26,360 --> 05:34:26,760
What?

4942
05:34:27,560 --> 05:34:28,520
What are you talking about?

4943
05:34:28,520 --> 05:34:29,640
Right, the game should pause,

4944
05:34:29,640 --> 05:34:31,400
because I'm not in it right now.

4945
05:34:31,400 --> 05:34:32,840
But I'll take it off the screen,

4946
05:34:32,840 --> 05:34:34,600
just so it's not like super distracting.

4947
05:34:37,320 --> 05:34:37,960
You're the game?

4948
05:34:37,960 --> 05:34:38,600
Okay.

4949
05:34:38,600 --> 05:34:40,920
And then I'll make myself big,

4950
05:34:40,920 --> 05:34:43,160
and then we'll go read some.

4951
05:34:44,520 --> 05:34:45,720
Oh, I didn't mean to do that.

4952
05:34:45,720 --> 05:34:46,600
I forgot I'm not supposed to-

4953
05:34:46,600 --> 05:34:47,320
Ah!

4954
05:34:47,320 --> 05:34:48,280
I'm not supposed to-

4955
05:34:49,480 --> 05:34:51,560
I do this all the time offline.

4956
05:34:52,360 --> 05:34:53,960
I do this all the time offline.

4957
05:34:53,960 --> 05:34:56,440
I'm not supposed to move the freaking window,

4958
05:34:56,440 --> 05:35:00,360
and I do it because did that work?

4959
05:35:00,360 --> 05:35:01,080
Oh, it worked.

4960
05:35:01,640 --> 05:35:02,840
Okay, I don't know how that worked,

4961
05:35:02,840 --> 05:35:03,480
but it worked.

4962
05:35:03,480 --> 05:35:04,920
Okay, let me refresh my phone.

4963
05:35:06,680 --> 05:35:07,320
I broke it.

4964
05:35:07,320 --> 05:35:08,440
I did that a little bit though.

4965
05:35:11,000 --> 05:35:12,360
Are you mentioning taking a break?

4966
05:35:12,360 --> 05:35:13,800
I'm going to be fine if you can break on time.

4967
05:35:13,800 --> 05:35:15,720
It's like someone's trying to stream for short streams.

4968
05:35:15,720 --> 05:35:17,720
You can do one, two hours at a time.

4969
05:35:17,720 --> 05:35:18,920
Yeah, I'm going to try it out.

4970
05:35:18,920 --> 05:35:21,160
I've got in the stream next month,

4971
05:35:21,160 --> 05:35:23,160
and it's like, are we compatible?

4972
05:35:23,160 --> 05:35:25,400
Now, before anyone actually throws up

4973
05:35:25,400 --> 05:35:27,400
in case you answer something wrong,

4974
05:35:27,400 --> 05:35:29,320
it's just for shits and giggles.

4975
05:35:29,320 --> 05:35:30,920
I'm going to ask questions,

4976
05:35:30,920 --> 05:35:33,800
that there's no way you're going to know about, okay?

4977
05:35:33,800 --> 05:35:35,560
Did I say 24% complete?

4978
05:35:35,560 --> 05:35:37,640
Yes, we completed the campaign mode,

4979
05:35:37,640 --> 05:35:39,000
but we've not got all the collectives,

4980
05:35:39,000 --> 05:35:40,680
so we need to go back and do that all.

4981
05:35:40,680 --> 05:35:42,440
And there's also missions in Middle Earth

4982
05:35:42,440 --> 05:35:45,240
where we have to give people quest items and stuff, okay?

4983
05:35:45,240 --> 05:35:46,840
So yeah, I'm not compatible.

4984
05:35:46,840 --> 05:35:48,840
No, no, no, it's for fun, okay?

4985
05:35:48,840 --> 05:35:51,640
I'm going to ask questions that you won't know.

4986
05:35:51,640 --> 05:35:53,960
I'll ask some questions that you might know.

4987
05:35:56,040 --> 05:35:57,000
Some will be basic.

4988
05:35:57,000 --> 05:36:02,680
Some will be very deep,

4989
05:36:02,680 --> 05:36:04,520
and I'll just straight up have to guess.

4990
05:36:04,520 --> 05:36:05,480
Like, you'll have no idea.

4991
05:36:05,480 --> 05:36:08,280
So don't worry, I'm going to practice.

4992
05:36:08,280 --> 05:36:09,320
I'm going to practice.

4993
05:36:09,320 --> 05:36:12,760
I'm going to look around and see about shorter streams,

4994
05:36:12,760 --> 05:36:14,600
but high-quality short streams.

4995
05:36:16,440 --> 05:36:18,920
Yeah, I realized I forgot to send you my Morrow morning.

4996
05:36:18,920 --> 05:36:21,400
I've been trying to say something every morning.

4997
05:36:21,400 --> 05:36:22,760
Yeah, morning, Reefland.

4998
05:36:22,760 --> 05:36:24,200
Love you, Stranny, love you, Reefland.

4999
05:36:24,200 --> 05:36:26,440
Don't worry, you don't have to send me every day.

5000
05:36:26,440 --> 05:36:27,240
But if you'd like to, yeah.

5001
05:36:28,600 --> 05:36:31,240
Would you be interested in Modern Elden Ring?

5002
05:36:31,240 --> 05:36:32,120
Seamless Co-op.

5003
05:36:32,200 --> 05:36:34,120
Yeah, I'm playing it with the...

5004
05:36:34,120 --> 05:36:35,800
Send sister, soon to you.

5005
05:36:37,240 --> 05:36:39,560
You can't just talk about your sweaty panties

5006
05:36:39,560 --> 05:36:41,320
and expect us to be okay.

5007
05:36:41,320 --> 05:36:42,440
I did have some more.

5008
05:36:43,400 --> 05:36:45,320
Please do more sent play audios.

5009
05:36:46,760 --> 05:36:48,200
Wait a minute, Reefland.

5010
05:36:48,200 --> 05:36:49,000
You've typed the same.

5011
05:36:49,000 --> 05:36:50,760
You're right, two back to back, okay?

5012
05:36:51,960 --> 05:36:53,160
With your sweaty, cute hands,

5013
05:36:53,160 --> 05:36:54,680
I could give you the most amazing hand.

5014
05:36:56,840 --> 05:36:58,680
I could give, but I don't...

5015
05:36:58,680 --> 05:36:59,000
Okay.

5016
05:36:59,080 --> 05:36:59,560
Okay.

5017
05:37:01,400 --> 05:37:02,280
You could add a...

5018
05:37:04,040 --> 05:37:07,400
A savviette for the pineapple suggestion, Reefland.

5019
05:37:07,400 --> 05:37:08,680
Sweet pineapple and pizza.

5020
05:37:11,000 --> 05:37:11,800
Hi, Johnny.

5021
05:37:11,800 --> 05:37:12,120
Hi.

5022
05:37:19,160 --> 05:37:19,640
Hold on.

5023
05:37:26,520 --> 05:37:27,160
It's weird.

5024
05:37:29,160 --> 05:37:30,920
Sorry, not everything are going to be download.

5025
05:37:32,440 --> 05:37:33,240
Well, it's weird.

5026
05:37:33,240 --> 05:37:35,240
I feel like I have to correct myself here.

5027
05:37:38,520 --> 05:37:38,920
What?

5028
05:37:43,240 --> 05:37:43,720
What?

5029
05:37:44,760 --> 05:37:46,360
Are you guys having brain worms today?

5030
05:37:46,360 --> 05:37:47,000
What's going on?

5031
05:37:55,320 --> 05:37:57,160
Okay, I don't understand.

5032
05:37:58,120 --> 05:38:00,920
Well, that's been called with all the messages, I guess.

5033
05:38:00,920 --> 05:38:01,560
Kind of.

5034
05:38:01,560 --> 05:38:03,080
Oh, just a few more.

5035
05:38:03,880 --> 05:38:05,400
And sent play.

5036
05:38:05,400 --> 05:38:05,960
Hey, woman.

5037
05:38:05,960 --> 05:38:07,880
You just want to say that when you get old,

5038
05:38:07,880 --> 05:38:11,240
you won't be surrounded by a thousand reflames.

5039
05:38:11,240 --> 05:38:12,520
Well, you're going to keep me alive.

5040
05:38:13,320 --> 05:38:14,600
Every time I pop my clogs,

5041
05:38:14,600 --> 05:38:16,520
you're going to do CPR on my ribcage.

5042
05:38:16,520 --> 05:38:18,200
It's going to be busted and broken.

5043
05:38:21,800 --> 05:38:22,520
That's actually cool.

5044
05:38:23,160 --> 05:38:24,360
I also have sweaty hands,

5045
05:38:24,360 --> 05:38:25,160
and it can be a pain.

5046
05:38:25,160 --> 05:38:26,360
Yeah, they're sweating right now.

5047
05:38:26,360 --> 05:38:28,520
It's actually been a bit uncomfortable to stream today.

5048
05:38:28,520 --> 05:38:29,960
This is probably the worst.

5049
05:38:29,960 --> 05:38:31,240
I've had it in a very long time,

5050
05:38:31,240 --> 05:38:32,520
but I'm quite stressed right now.

5051
05:38:32,520 --> 05:38:34,280
So that probably doesn't help in general.

5052
05:38:35,080 --> 05:38:36,360
Hello for me.

5053
05:38:36,360 --> 05:38:38,040
You've been such a light in my life.

5054
05:38:38,040 --> 05:38:39,400
I wasn't expecting.

5055
05:38:39,400 --> 05:38:40,520
Don't want to bring down the mood.

5056
05:38:44,360 --> 05:38:47,320
But you thought about end in the game,

5057
05:38:47,320 --> 05:38:50,360
and I've had a positive impact on you.

5058
05:38:50,360 --> 05:38:52,920
And I feel a love for you

5059
05:38:52,920 --> 05:38:54,040
that I haven't felt in a long time.

5060
05:38:54,040 --> 05:38:55,240
The world is a better place.

5061
05:38:55,320 --> 05:38:57,720
Oh, I think I'm glad we found that you feel better.

5062
05:38:57,720 --> 05:38:58,840
I love you too, darling.

5063
05:38:59,960 --> 05:39:00,600
Maybe be careful.

5064
05:39:00,600 --> 05:39:01,720
You can always pause the game,

5065
05:39:01,720 --> 05:39:04,120
but you close that game.

5066
05:39:04,120 --> 05:39:05,960
You close that XFile of the game,

5067
05:39:05,960 --> 05:39:08,680
or the, you know, the soger.

5068
05:39:10,280 --> 05:39:12,200
You have the most beautiful hands in the world.

5069
05:39:12,200 --> 05:39:13,720
Yeah, you want to touch my sweaty hands.

5070
05:39:14,440 --> 05:39:16,520
It's trying to have something important to tell you.

5071
05:39:16,520 --> 05:39:18,200
You're awesome, and we love you.

5072
05:39:18,200 --> 05:39:19,400
Oh, yeah, I love you too.

5073
05:39:20,200 --> 05:39:21,320
We will join the dark side,

5074
05:39:21,320 --> 05:39:22,760
if it means you can take mommy around.

5075
05:39:23,400 --> 05:39:25,640
You'd Anakin Skywalker for me?

5076
05:39:27,400 --> 05:39:30,440
You sprained your wrist to one of my audios?

5077
05:39:32,600 --> 05:39:33,240
Which one?

5078
05:39:35,960 --> 05:39:39,880
The tofu teacher?

5079
05:39:40,520 --> 05:39:41,960
You sprained your wrist?

5080
05:39:41,960 --> 05:39:42,680
Are you okay?

5081
05:39:43,400 --> 05:39:44,760
I mean, you know,

5082
05:39:44,760 --> 05:39:46,600
I do take a little bit of pride in my work,

5083
05:39:46,600 --> 05:39:49,560
but yeah, then you sprained your wrist over it.

5084
05:39:49,560 --> 05:39:50,920
A wreathling? You're a degenerate.

5085
05:39:52,920 --> 05:39:54,680
Please be careful, okay?

5086
05:39:54,680 --> 05:39:55,640
Don't hurt your wrist.

5087
05:39:57,320 --> 05:39:59,080
The women and the children.

5088
05:39:59,080 --> 05:39:59,960
I hate them.

5089
05:40:00,600 --> 05:40:02,360
Fledgely, you're on your Anakin sprain.

5090
05:40:03,640 --> 05:40:05,000
Hey, scrawny.

5091
05:40:05,000 --> 05:40:06,280
Same wreathling with the sweaty hands.

5092
05:40:06,280 --> 05:40:08,360
I'll gladly take the sweat off your hands, if you wish.

5093
05:40:09,160 --> 05:40:12,200
Also, may we wreathlings please have some kisses?

5094
05:40:12,200 --> 05:40:12,700
Yeah.

5095
05:40:15,320 --> 05:40:17,720
Now you have to imagine touching my sweaty hands

5096
05:40:17,720 --> 05:40:18,360
while we kiss.

5097
05:40:19,000 --> 05:40:20,600
And I get all embarrassed that they're sweaty,

5098
05:40:20,600 --> 05:40:21,960
but you're like, no, no, it's fine.

5099
05:40:23,720 --> 05:40:24,760
You want background music?

5100
05:40:24,760 --> 05:40:26,840
Is it deadly quiet in here?

5101
05:40:26,840 --> 05:40:28,520
I don't even have background music.

5102
05:40:29,560 --> 05:40:30,680
It's not in the files.

5103
05:40:30,680 --> 05:40:31,640
I've moved it.

5104
05:40:32,360 --> 05:40:33,640
So you're just going to have to listen

5105
05:40:33,640 --> 05:40:35,720
to my stinky voice in the dark, okay?

5106
05:40:36,840 --> 05:40:38,200
Actually, I'm going to see if there's anyone

5107
05:40:38,200 --> 05:40:39,640
we can redirect into.

5108
05:40:41,240 --> 05:40:44,120
As I said, I'm going to...

5109
05:40:45,800 --> 05:40:47,320
I can't believe we actually played

5110
05:40:47,400 --> 05:40:48,440
the label Lord of the Rings.

5111
05:40:48,440 --> 05:40:50,360
I know that sounds silly because I picked it,

5112
05:40:50,360 --> 05:40:53,880
but like, it's just like, I get to do whatever the...

5113
05:40:54,520 --> 05:40:55,640
I want, you know?

5114
05:40:56,760 --> 05:40:58,360
I get to do whatever the...

5115
05:40:58,360 --> 05:40:59,000
I want.

5116
05:41:00,760 --> 05:41:02,600
And it feels good, man.

5117
05:41:03,960 --> 05:41:05,080
It feels good, man, okay?

5118
05:41:07,480 --> 05:41:10,120
Oh yeah, have we redirected into these before?

5119
05:41:10,120 --> 05:41:11,560
I don't think we have.

5120
05:41:13,800 --> 05:41:16,200
Okay, we're going to redirect into her.

5121
05:41:16,280 --> 05:41:17,640
I'm being you today.

5122
05:41:18,600 --> 05:41:19,720
I must say, man.

5123
05:41:21,480 --> 05:41:22,360
Strange...

5124
05:41:22,360 --> 05:41:24,200
Strange refilling, identify yourself.

5125
05:41:24,760 --> 05:41:25,960
We may just throw it up as a meme,

5126
05:41:25,960 --> 05:41:27,320
but if your health actually ever demands

5127
05:41:27,320 --> 05:41:28,440
that it'll be fine, we'll miss you,

5128
05:41:28,440 --> 05:41:29,880
but I don't want you to be too listy.

5129
05:41:30,520 --> 05:41:31,480
As far as I'm concerned,

5130
05:41:31,480 --> 05:41:32,920
there's only one ring to rule them all,

5131
05:41:32,920 --> 05:41:34,600
and that's the ring in your bag to heart.

5132
05:41:34,600 --> 05:41:35,240
That's good.

5133
05:41:38,760 --> 05:41:39,880
Not that much of a reason.

5134
05:41:41,560 --> 05:41:43,560
Your voice is as stinky as your voice is.

5135
05:41:43,560 --> 05:41:44,040
Calm in.

5136
05:41:45,000 --> 05:41:47,160
Yeah, even when you get angry, it's scary,

5137
05:41:47,160 --> 05:41:50,200
but you're the reflin that said it the first time,

5138
05:41:50,200 --> 05:41:51,560
and then we made a meme of it too.

5139
05:41:56,600 --> 05:41:58,840
I want you to be okay, and I love you.

5140
05:41:58,840 --> 05:42:00,360
I promise I'm okay.

5141
05:42:00,360 --> 05:42:01,160
It's just like...

5142
05:42:03,400 --> 05:42:05,640
You know, things are going to resolve themselves,

5143
05:42:05,640 --> 05:42:07,880
but we're just in the awkward phase of like...

5144
05:42:14,680 --> 05:42:17,400
That...

5145
05:42:17,400 --> 05:42:19,160
This is the phase we're in right now.

5146
05:42:20,120 --> 05:42:20,600
Just...

5147
05:42:22,840 --> 05:42:24,120
That's the phase we're in right now.

5148
05:42:24,120 --> 05:42:26,280
That's the only way I can describe the phase I'm...

5149
05:42:26,920 --> 05:42:28,760
It's currently occurring right now,

5150
05:42:28,760 --> 05:42:32,280
and that'll be over with soon, right?

5151
05:42:32,280 --> 05:42:33,800
Every time he kisses me, he's happy.

5152
05:42:33,800 --> 05:42:35,560
I could listen to the whole stream and just kisses.

5153
05:42:35,560 --> 05:42:37,640
Oh boy, you're going to enjoy the membership

5154
05:42:37,640 --> 05:42:39,720
next ASMR membership stream.

5155
05:42:39,720 --> 05:42:42,200
I'm not allowed to talk until I do a thousand kisses,

5156
05:42:42,200 --> 05:42:44,840
because I keep saying I'm doing a membership ASMR,

5157
05:42:44,840 --> 05:42:46,520
and then I stop instantly.

5158
05:42:47,240 --> 05:42:52,440
So my punishment is 1,000 kisses in the next ASMR membership stream.

5159
05:42:52,440 --> 05:42:53,800
You're in this timing phase.

5160
05:42:54,440 --> 05:42:55,640
You've injured your right hand,

5161
05:42:55,640 --> 05:42:58,120
and your cute nurse helps you relieve your stress.

5162
05:42:58,120 --> 05:42:59,880
I like plots like that, honestly.

5163
05:43:00,760 --> 05:43:02,680
It's your phase, mom.

5164
05:43:02,680 --> 05:43:04,040
Is this thing live?

5165
05:43:04,040 --> 05:43:04,840
No, I'm sorry, it's pre-reported.

5166
05:43:04,840 --> 05:43:05,880
Are you squidding me right now?

5167
05:43:07,240 --> 05:43:07,720
Maybe.

5168
05:43:07,720 --> 05:43:09,960
I said it once, and he'll say it again.

5169
05:43:10,040 --> 05:43:11,960
I'm very grateful for this community,

5170
05:43:11,960 --> 05:43:13,960
and for Strani giving her time for us.

5171
05:43:13,960 --> 05:43:15,480
I'm always going to support you.

5172
05:43:15,480 --> 05:43:16,760
Thank you very much, okay.

5173
05:43:17,480 --> 05:43:19,960
I'm glad reeflings feel that way.

5174
05:43:19,960 --> 05:43:21,320
Even my boll heard it as.

5175
05:43:23,080 --> 05:43:25,240
I've been a silly boo, but...

5176
05:43:25,240 --> 05:43:27,240
Don't worry, you can use me as a sweat rag.

5177
05:43:27,240 --> 05:43:28,440
I wouldn't mind.

5178
05:43:28,440 --> 05:43:31,160
Oh dear, is that how you're going to get your electrolytes back?

5179
05:43:31,160 --> 05:43:32,920
Via my salty sweat?

5180
05:43:34,600 --> 05:43:35,080
We would...

5181
05:43:35,640 --> 05:43:37,720
We worry about you more than you.

5182
05:43:38,520 --> 05:43:41,400
We worry about being lonely when you're happy and healthy.

5183
05:43:41,400 --> 05:43:43,160
But I've got to look after you, reefling,

5184
05:43:43,160 --> 05:43:44,280
or else you're going to throw up.

5185
05:43:45,640 --> 05:43:47,880
I'm actually going to puke all over yourself,

5186
05:43:48,440 --> 05:43:49,880
and I need to get you cleaned up.

5187
05:43:49,880 --> 05:43:53,000
Maybe I should just straight up make an ASMR roleplay

5188
05:43:53,000 --> 05:43:55,000
of that, like you threw up in the middle of the night.

5189
05:43:55,000 --> 05:43:56,440
It's like, mom, I fool up.

5190
05:43:56,440 --> 05:43:58,600
And then I come clean you, and then I get you a bath,

5191
05:43:58,600 --> 05:44:00,360
and I tell you, you'll feel better soon,

5192
05:44:00,360 --> 05:44:02,440
and it's okay to be anxious.

5193
05:44:03,000 --> 05:44:03,800
And pukelings?

5194
05:44:03,800 --> 05:44:04,440
Oh no!

5195
05:44:05,160 --> 05:44:06,040
Oh no!

5196
05:44:06,040 --> 05:44:07,400
What have we done?

5197
05:44:07,480 --> 05:44:08,120
What have we done?

5198
05:44:08,120 --> 05:44:09,000
We've started something.

5199
05:44:11,560 --> 05:44:14,040
Yeah, I don't know if we might have just accidentally

5200
05:44:14,040 --> 05:44:15,000
started something.

5201
05:44:15,000 --> 05:44:15,400
Eep.

5202
05:44:15,960 --> 05:44:16,360
Eep.

5203
05:44:17,640 --> 05:44:19,960
I'm also the reefling that ain't six times in a plan.

5204
05:44:19,960 --> 05:44:20,760
I'm doing it again.

5205
05:44:20,760 --> 05:44:21,960
Bruh!

5206
05:44:21,960 --> 05:44:23,240
That's gotta hurt.

5207
05:44:24,600 --> 05:44:26,360
I hope we make you as happy as we make the...

5208
05:44:26,360 --> 05:44:27,640
I mean, you certainly do.

5209
05:44:27,640 --> 05:44:28,600
I mean, shh.

5210
05:44:28,600 --> 05:44:28,840
Hey.

5211
05:44:30,520 --> 05:44:31,960
Forget about this ring, Strone.

5212
05:44:31,960 --> 05:44:33,160
I have one for you.

5213
05:44:33,160 --> 05:44:35,320
Aw, is that a marriage proposal?

5214
05:44:36,280 --> 05:44:38,680
But you didn't let me mind break you first.

5215
05:44:38,680 --> 05:44:40,360
Need a green puke and a moat now?

5216
05:44:41,000 --> 05:44:42,520
Actually, do you want that?

5217
05:44:45,240 --> 05:44:46,280
I don't know.

5218
05:44:46,280 --> 05:44:47,800
I don't know if that's a bit...

5219
05:44:49,320 --> 05:44:51,720
How can you look after us if you're down for the count?

5220
05:44:51,720 --> 05:44:52,040
I'm...

5221
05:44:52,040 --> 05:44:54,120
I don't get down for the count for long, though.

5222
05:44:54,920 --> 05:44:55,960
I'm gonna throw up.

5223
05:44:55,960 --> 05:44:56,520
Catch it.

5224
05:44:56,520 --> 05:44:58,040
Oh, I'm not gonna catch it.

5225
05:44:58,040 --> 05:44:58,840
Put it in the bin.

5226
05:44:59,720 --> 05:45:00,360
Put it in the bin.

5227
05:45:01,000 --> 05:45:01,880
Get in the bin.

5228
05:45:01,880 --> 05:45:02,680
Lom it in the bin.

5229
05:45:02,680 --> 05:45:03,800
Don't lom it on me.

5230
05:45:05,320 --> 05:45:06,600
Lore at your emote.

5231
05:45:06,600 --> 05:45:08,520
We're gonna do puke emote, so anyway.

5232
05:45:08,520 --> 05:45:11,400
I like the nausea-emote combination,

5233
05:45:11,400 --> 05:45:12,280
where you post the,

5234
05:45:12,280 --> 05:45:13,960
ooh, and then the nausea face,

5235
05:45:13,960 --> 05:45:15,000
like, you're about to do it,

5236
05:45:15,000 --> 05:45:15,960
but you don't do it yet.

5237
05:45:17,160 --> 05:45:18,200
Um...

5238
05:45:18,200 --> 05:45:20,120
If you ever need us, tell us,

5239
05:45:20,120 --> 05:45:21,640
and we'll try our hardest to cheer you up.

5240
05:45:21,640 --> 05:45:22,600
We love you, seriously.

5241
05:45:22,600 --> 05:45:23,240
Oh, we do.

5242
05:45:23,240 --> 05:45:24,120
We love you, too.

5243
05:45:24,120 --> 05:45:25,000
Don't worry, everything...

5244
05:45:26,840 --> 05:45:28,520
Day, a billion of saying,

5245
05:45:28,520 --> 05:45:29,800
like, it's all gonna calm down.

5246
05:45:32,120 --> 05:45:33,640
Cover Strone in our love,

5247
05:45:33,640 --> 05:45:35,000
puke him, honestly.

5248
05:45:35,320 --> 05:45:37,400
Make a rainbow puke emote.

5249
05:45:37,400 --> 05:45:38,360
It's in TM.

5250
05:45:38,360 --> 05:45:40,120
Maryssey actually wanted one of those,

5251
05:45:40,120 --> 05:45:41,400
which was really funny.

5252
05:45:41,400 --> 05:45:43,640
And I'm about to order the next,

5253
05:45:43,640 --> 05:45:46,200
like, missing a boat for everyone.

5254
05:45:46,200 --> 05:45:48,120
And I'm doing a few things first

5255
05:45:48,120 --> 05:45:50,200
in the background before I get them ordered,

5256
05:45:50,200 --> 05:45:51,560
but I should probably do it sooner or later,

5257
05:45:51,560 --> 05:45:53,640
because we took their sweetest time.

5258
05:45:54,760 --> 05:45:56,200
They took my shoulders.

5259
05:46:01,240 --> 05:46:03,880
One of your audios actually made me hand-free ink,

5260
05:46:03,880 --> 05:46:05,080
and I've been chasing that high

5261
05:46:05,080 --> 05:46:05,800
ever since.

5262
05:46:05,800 --> 05:46:06,600
What the heck?

5263
05:46:06,600 --> 05:46:08,120
I didn't even know I had that, Billy.

5264
05:46:09,640 --> 05:46:10,920
H.F.O.

5265
05:46:12,360 --> 05:46:15,000
And, like, hypnosis is quite big.

5266
05:46:15,000 --> 05:46:16,440
I've wanted to try it,

5267
05:46:16,440 --> 05:46:18,520
but I don't know if I have the skills for that.

5268
05:46:18,520 --> 05:46:18,920
I don't know.

5269
05:46:18,920 --> 05:46:19,720
I'll consider it.

5270
05:46:19,720 --> 05:46:21,320
Ah, can't see any of it.

5271
05:46:21,320 --> 05:46:22,920
It would be an all-audio free access

5272
05:46:22,920 --> 05:46:23,480
all that does.

5273
05:46:23,480 --> 05:46:24,520
Hey, honey.

5274
05:46:24,520 --> 05:46:26,680
The same reason that ink and her say hands.

5275
05:46:26,680 --> 05:46:27,240
It doesn't hurt.

5276
05:46:27,240 --> 05:46:28,040
I just feel tired.

5277
05:46:28,040 --> 05:46:28,920
I can go seven times.

5278
05:46:28,920 --> 05:46:29,480
Oh, my God.

5279
05:46:30,440 --> 05:46:31,160
Just be careful.

5280
05:46:31,160 --> 05:46:32,600
You don't have a death grip, okay?

5281
05:46:33,560 --> 05:46:36,280
Peeler, we're short for pukeler.

5282
05:46:36,280 --> 05:46:38,520
No, it's just the reeflings that puke.

5283
05:46:38,520 --> 05:46:41,000
Everyone else can hold it together,

5284
05:46:41,000 --> 05:46:43,080
but, like, I was so late today.

5285
05:46:43,080 --> 05:46:45,160
Like, the meeting had just finished,

5286
05:46:45,160 --> 05:46:46,920
and it had gone a bit longer than I expected,

5287
05:46:46,920 --> 05:46:48,200
just because a few things popped up

5288
05:46:48,200 --> 05:46:49,480
that I didn't expect.

5289
05:46:49,480 --> 05:46:50,920
And then it was just chaos,

5290
05:46:50,920 --> 05:46:52,760
and I was like, oh, God, I need to make my tea.

5291
05:46:54,360 --> 05:46:56,840
It might be good for once you've levelled up

5292
05:46:56,840 --> 05:46:57,880
your hypnosis, though.

5293
05:46:57,880 --> 05:46:58,360
Eh.

5294
05:46:59,640 --> 05:47:00,040
Eh.

5295
05:47:02,840 --> 05:47:06,280
And, right, my lovely jubbly reeflings.

5296
05:47:06,280 --> 05:47:07,640
I am going to go.

5297
05:47:08,360 --> 05:47:09,720
I hope you are okay.

5298
05:47:09,720 --> 05:47:10,840
Thank you for hanging and playing

5299
05:47:10,840 --> 05:47:12,440
one of my favorite games with me.

5300
05:47:13,080 --> 05:47:15,320
Tomorrow we're gonna 100% it,

5301
05:47:15,320 --> 05:47:17,560
and we're gonna have a new year time.

5302
05:47:19,000 --> 05:47:20,360
I love you.

5303
05:47:21,880 --> 05:47:22,920
I hope you'll be okay.

5304
05:47:23,960 --> 05:47:25,960
And I am redirecting to you

5305
05:47:26,840 --> 05:47:28,360
from someone from B&U,

5306
05:47:28,360 --> 05:47:31,320
and as always, I act my way.

5307
05:47:31,320 --> 05:47:32,280
They act their way.

5308
05:47:32,280 --> 05:47:35,400
You guys will be a good example,

5309
05:47:35,400 --> 05:47:37,000
I'm sure, for me, okay?

5310
05:47:37,720 --> 05:47:40,200
You'll be the goodest of boys with your example.

5311
05:47:41,800 --> 05:47:43,320
And we'll take it from there, all right?

5312
05:47:44,600 --> 05:47:45,080
Okay.

5313
05:47:48,520 --> 05:47:50,040
I say make sure she's online,

5314
05:47:50,040 --> 05:47:51,240
make sure she goes offline.

5315
05:47:51,240 --> 05:47:52,920
I swear she's wrapping up streams.

5316
05:47:52,920 --> 05:47:53,720
No, she's not.

5317
05:47:53,720 --> 05:47:54,760
She's still streaming.

5318
05:47:54,760 --> 05:47:56,440
All right, thank you so, so much reeflings.

5319
05:47:56,440 --> 05:47:58,040
I'll talk to you tomorrow.

5320
05:47:58,040 --> 05:48:00,520
I'll be a lot more energetic tomorrow, so, okay?

5321
05:48:01,000 --> 05:48:01,480
Okay.

5322
05:48:07,160 --> 05:48:08,040
See you tomorrow.

5323
05:48:08,040 --> 05:48:08,600
Bye-bye.

5324
05:48:08,600 --> 05:48:09,640
Have a good night, okay?

5325
05:48:09,640 --> 05:48:10,200
Bye-bye.
