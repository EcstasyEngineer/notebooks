0	29920	I think the test is in twickels.
30920	32920	Are you there? I'm on? I'm alive?
32920	34920	Woman! Reeling!
34920	38920	Good morning! Good evening! Good afternoon!
38920	43920	I know. I'm a whole six minutes early. What's going on? What's happening?
43920	46920	Isaac's a bit loud. I thought that.
46920	50920	You know what? I actually thought Isaac was a bit loud.
50920	55920	Oh my god, my controller isn't on. Of course it's not. How embarrassing.
56920	61920	I'm going to go into a match because I think the actual game volume is lower.
61920	64920	Of course we get burn in basement. Relax.
64920	70920	Oh my god, wait. I haven't done hardcore angels?
70920	74920	Wow. Terrible.
74920	79920	Who are you and what have you done with mommy? She's never early. I know. She's always fucking late.
79920	86920	Right. Updates. I've got good updates. You're going to like this.
86920	91920	Is Isaac still too loud?
91920	95920	You know what? I'll put it down again. I'll put it down a wee bit more.
96920	102920	So I did a community post where you can submit.
102920	109920	If you didn't know, I did a community post and you can literally tell me what words you want me to say or phrases.
109920	113920	A lot of people have given me phrases which I'm surprised about.
113920	121920	But I'm basically taking screenshots of what you guys are saying
121920	126920	and then I'm going to do like a 60, like a one hour.
131920	139920	The caught fish is never early nor is it too late. It will arrive safely on stream when it meets you.
139920	145920	God, there's how many chicks like unironically watch me. I'm getting asked.
145920	150920	So good girl.
150920	159920	I succeed. Oh, if you want to play along with it. And before I lose this and you guys are like, I'm still doing the run. Smile.
159920	166920	But yeah. If you want that, there's a community post.
166920	172920	I have officially written or sent away all the content
172920	176920	for the ASMR collabs I have with other creators.
176920	183920	Okay. It took me so long to do. I have 11 confirmed ASMR 101 collabs.
183920	194920	And it took me so long to get there. But I've done 11, which means when I've wrapped up, that's 11% of my freaking goals, my objectives.
194920	201920	So if I keep on track, I should be able to do finish my goals within a year because I wanted to do that.
201920	205920	I don't know if I can do the Xbox goal. That seems like a second year goal.
205920	214920	I'm going to be so happy because she woke up. I am God's EPS soldier right now.
214920	223920	But yes, I did that. I took a look into doing the clipping program.
223920	234920	So if you're an established clipping channel, it looks like we can basically match Idol End's offer, which is a dollar a pair of 1000 views.
234920	241920	A pair accepted clip channel. So that will be something that comes out in August.
241920	250920	The video game for a viewer is definitely looking like August, sadly.
250920	259920	I fucked up my artwork. I'm really upset, but I've kind of... I've done it now. I've made a mistake. I've learned from my mistakes.
259920	265920	So if Gen 2 and 3, if and when, do come out with a video game, they're going to be correct.
265920	272920	I'm very lucky that I fucked up on my specific artwork and not someone else's specific artwork.
272920	279920	Aces is fine, Emmys is fine, Azuras is fine, Merces is fine, Shibys is fine. It's mine I fucked up on.
279920	286920	So I'm really glad it was mine because mistakes were made, things were learned along the way.
286920	294920	But next time when it comes to animated alternative art, it's much wiser to just go to the person
294920	301920	that draws and animates it, not get it drawn elsewhere and then animated by someone else
301920	310920	because that's how things get messed up and my section is supposed to be banal,
310920	317920	but instead it's turned into hot dogging, but the audio I recorded is for banal and I don't know what to do.
318920	328920	I think I'm going to leave my original audio type in, but unfortunately the artwork doesn't match the section correctly.
328920	335920	So yeah, that's my update about my section in the video game.
335920	344920	But look, mistakes happen and I will say, I have learned so much and I'm so happy that I could even learn...
344920	349920	I can even learn to commission a video game, I know it sounds silly but...
358920	361920	But yeah, is there a scene where it works properly?
361920	372920	So yes, everyone has an animated scene, but my type is banal but the animation is hot dogging
372920	375920	because that was a mistake on my part.
375920	380920	The animator didn't know that he was supposed to make it disappear.
380920	382920	Hocus pocus.
386920	391920	But anyway, I messed up, but look, lessons learned, things have happened.
391920	398920	I had a cute night with my dad, he wanted to watch me play meccosal and I was like, oh god, oh god.
398920	400920	Because I was like, what did I see in the stream?
400920	404920	But we actually did see him watch it and it wasn't that bad.
404920	408920	I honestly wasn't that bad that stream, I could have been way worse.
408920	414920	But he was like, oh my god, I remember all that and I'm like, oh yeah.
414920	418920	I showed him, he was freaking laughing at me.
418920	425920	I showed him the map where he watched the meccosal, we watched it together, we didn't watch Star Trek last night.
425920	431920	And he did what?
431920	434920	Oh excuse me, how are we on today?
434920	436920	Pardon me, boys.
436920	443920	I was like, I don't know if you just remember the snow map where you had to blow up the generator
443920	447920	and then all the friend Lee's turn hostile because you were actually hidden.
447920	453920	And I was trying to blow up the bridge and he was like, oh, that weapon's not going to do anything against that bridge.
453920	456920	And I'm like, how am I supposed to know that?
456920	458920	I'm going to make, it's giving me missiles.
458920	465920	Of course I'm going to use the freaking missiles and he's like laughing at my terrible freaking thingy.
465920	470920	And I was panicking and he was like, you know what, you actually are a wee bit entertaining.
470920	473920	I'm like, excuse you, I'm a bit entertaining.
473920	479920	Like give me some credit because he was like, oh that was actually kind of funny.
479920	486920	And I was like, yeah, so like if a dad calling you, literally call me a noob and I'm like, excuse you.
486920	492920	I was like, not even, I probably couldn't even speak when I first consumed the game.
492920	496920	Like, yeah, just to be that, right?
496920	501920	Because we were talking about content creators in general because I showed them more of the VTubers
501920	503920	and I showed them what the girls were doing, what I do.
503920	509920	And I said like, if you play a game that a refund really enjoys, like it's more entertaining.
509920	514920	Like it has so much more factor because if I had to watch a streamer play Viva Punyatta
514920	521920	or play, you know, Hell Divers 2, well I have a nostalgic bonus when it comes to Viva Punyatta.
521920	527920	Shame my daughter is a noob. I am forsaken. Why am I forsaken?
527920	532920	But he wants to play the game so I think my PC is getting stolen after this stream.
532920	536920	But it was fantastic.
536920	539920	Yes, I do apologize to anyone who is looking forward to the ASMR.
539920	544920	This is where the bad announcements begin.
544920	547920	We hate you, strongy, bad announcements.
547920	550920	I cannot do ASMR for three weeks.
550920	554920	Nor can I do any type of membership stream for three weeks.
554920	564920	However, as always, I will make it up instantly when my me pops goes away way again.
564920	568920	So today's ASMR has been swapped out.
568920	571920	But yes, there will be no ASMR plans for three weeks, there will be no thingy.
571920	575920	However, my gen mates are always doing ASMR.
575920	582920	Mercy did a fantastic ASMR stream yesterday called You Are My Pet POV.
583920	586920	Anarch, you're so stinky.
586920	589920	Boo. Thank you for the tip, Anarch.
589920	594920	Literally, this is the boooove ones. You suck, strong, boo.
594920	600920	Okay, for the updates on everyone's Patreon, today everyone's Patreon will have at least one audio out.
600920	606920	There is a bit of a...
606920	611920	Try to phrase it nicely so it doesn't sound like an arsehole, but I do want to explain the situation.
611920	618920	There is a bit of a traffic jam, if you will, in production because some talents got a bit distracted
618920	621920	and forgot they had to record on top of streaming.
621920	624920	And it caused a bit of a traffic jam.
624920	631920	So today, by the end of today, this stream, I will be editing for myself in Azura.
631920	635920	There should be a Mercy and a AC.
635920	640920	And Shibi and Emi should already have uploads because they are done.
640920	642920	Okay, I have it.
642920	648920	Literally, the girls got a wee bit carried away and I was like, hey guys, remember that time we did Patreon
648920	650920	and it's like your main source of income.
650920	653920	Please, please, it takes 15 minutes.
653920	655920	15 minutes, please record.
655920	661920	So it's a bit of a traffic jam, but it should be resolved by the end of this week.
661920	662920	So, yeah.
662920	663920	Understandable games are...
663920	666920	Yes, thank you for no one being annoyed at them.
666920	672920	But yes, at the end of the day, I will ensure that there is an audio for everyone at least one up.
672920	675920	And level up.
675920	676920	Okay.
676920	680920	And then take 15 minutes forever later.
680920	682920	Ah.
682920	684920	I love them.
684920	686920	I'm like, girls, please.
686920	692920	Now, they're still in my batch of scripts and I know my batch of scripts takes 15 minutes to record and you know more.
692920	695920	And I'm like, come on, baby girls, come on.
695920	697920	I'm like rubbing the lamp.
697920	700920	I'm like, come on, genie, you come, you come.
700920	703920	I'm like begging them, please, please, I want my knees.
703920	704920	But yes.
704920	706920	Thank you for your patience.
706920	707920	Apologies for the wait.
707920	713920	But again, after today, at least one will be up and then it will smooth out and be like,
713920	716920	there's two out by the 14.
716920	717920	Roughly.
717920	720920	I can't remember what everyone's upload date is, to be honest.
720920	721920	It's all over the shop.
721920	727920	But next month, I plan on having dates along with their schedules.
727920	730920	You know how they posted that funny haha schedule?
730920	732920	That...
732920	735920	Oh, it's not an ASMR stream.
735920	736920	My apologies.
736920	738920	No, I can't do ASMR for three weeks.
738920	740920	My gen mates at any point are doing ASMR.
740920	746920	Emmy is doing ASMR this week when she returns.
746920	749920	She's actually done a membership script writing.
749920	752920	We lurking to be like, hmm, is this how you write scripts?
752920	754920	I mean, this is how I write scripts.
754920	756920	I mean, it's just pure paper.
756920	757920	Pure paper.
757920	758920	Okay, I'm a...
758920	759920	You can always rub my lamp instead.
759920	761920	Go over here.
761920	763920	I'm going to slurp my tea, okay?
763920	765920	And then we'll get into a cane.
765920	768920	So you can actually see cane stats to the left.
768920	771920	He has 1.3 movement speed, which is fantastic.
771920	773920	And his damage is a bit harder.
773920	775920	That 4.2 damage.
775920	776920	Not bad, believe it.
776920	778920	And he has 1% luck.
778920	783920	So luck doesn't affect things like the Gambo machines.
783920	786920	What it affects is drop rate.
786920	790920	So we have an item, that little foot you see on my stuff.
790920	792920	We have a little item called Lucky Foot,
792920	796920	which means one, our luck is added by one.
796920	799920	And two, it means we can huff pills,
799920	801920	and they will be positive.
801920	805920	Now, there is a few pills that are positive in quotation marks
805920	806920	that aren't really.
806920	809920	An example of that is One Makes You Vigor.
809920	812920	It increases your hitbox, but it's considered a good pill.
812920	816920	But it means you can't lose stats via pills, basically.
820920	821920	Hi, Strawny.
821920	823920	With her father-in-law, I'm guessing there won't be a new
823920	824920	Patreon recording session.
824920	828920	I've already recorded my three audios.
828920	832920	I need to edit the script for the fourth that we wrote together.
832920	835920	And then, that's all for this month.
835920	837920	So don't worry, my Patreon.
837920	839920	I'm a smart bean.
839920	841920	I did a few things in advance,
841920	844920	because I knew how much of a numpty I was going to be, okay?
844920	847920	It also affects some item ability proc rates.
847920	848920	Yes, that too.
848920	850920	That is a very big note.
850920	852920	If you see in the bottom left,
852920	854920	it looks like I have a little paper clip in the corner.
854920	857920	I can open gold chests for free.
857920	859920	I do not require a key.
859920	862920	Three One Makes You Vigor should give you a transformation, though.
862920	863920	Yeah.
865920	867920	It's just that amazing.
867920	871920	Yeah, I knew I had to spam ahead, if you will.
871920	873920	Right, I'm slurping my tea.
875920	877920	The tea has been slurped.
878920	881920	Wow, Cain was built for a looting.
881920	884920	Yeah, so we're not playing Tainted Cain.
884920	888920	Tainted Cain has this thing called Loot Bag,
888920	891920	where you can take eight items.
891920	893920	Isaac's still a bit loud.
893920	896920	Goddamn, Isaac, calm down.
896920	898920	I was really, actually,
898920	900920	that was one thing about the Microsoft stream.
900920	902920	My dad was like, wait, you didn't test the audio.
902920	905920	And I'm like, fucking stop annihilating me.
905920	908920	Oh my gosh, not all streamers are perfect.
908920	911920	I was getting absolutely roasted by my dad on my stream,
911920	914920	and I'm like, I've already told him how much I made in my first month.
914920	917920	I'm going to let it be a surprise when the short comes out
917920	919920	how much I made in my first month,
919920	921920	but I was like, I'm fucking annihilated.
921920	922920	I'm like, back off.
922920	923920	Get off me.
923920	924920	What's up?
924920	925920	Hi, Stranny.
925920	926920	Hi, everyone.
926920	927920	Are you excited?
927920	928920	Immers is coming back.
928920	930920	Your dad's a pro stream critic.
930920	932920	You're perfect roasted by dad.
932920	933920	Everything is shining.
933920	936920	Did he get shocked when the helicopter scene showed the audio peak?
936920	937920	Well, he was...
937920	939920	So we were at the waterfall,
939920	941920	and he was reading chat.
941920	942920	He was reading you guys,
942920	945920	and he was like, oh, they're really nice to you.
945920	947920	Because you play so badly.
947920	950920	I was like, all right, dad.
950920	952920	Fuck's sake, man.
952920	954920	But I was like, yeah.
954920	956920	So that's what chat is considered about.
956920	957920	I was like saying that.
957920	959920	I got asked reflins, but people say chat.
959920	960920	And he's lurking.
960920	962920	Literally, he was reading you.
962920	964920	And he was like, oh, everyone's so nice to you.
964920	966920	And I'm like, yeah.
966920	969920	And he was like...
969920	971920	So obviously, I was telling the stories about, like,
971920	974920	my dad used to play multiplayer in the water on Atlas.
974920	976920	And he was like, oh, you remember, you remember.
976920	980920	And I'm like, yeah, dad, you never stop talking to me about it.
980920	982920	Every time I bring up, like, Xbox.
982920	986920	Was he expecting us to treat you like an enemy on Xbox Live?
986920	988920	Oh, well, I was talking about, like,
988920	991920	how Xbox used to have open mic in those games.
991920	993920	And I was like, oh, people would play music.
993920	995920	They'd spam the N word down the mic.
995920	996920	All of that.
996920	998920	And he was like, oh, that's right.
998920	999920	That's right.
999920	1000920	Yeah, yeah.
1000920	1001920	And I'm like, yep.
1001920	1003920	That's because it happened in Call of Duty when I played.
1003920	1009920	Well, is there a chance Papa Kottos is lurking?
1009920	1010920	Well, he's not reading.
1010920	1011920	Right now he's asleep.
1011920	1013920	I can hear the walls vibrate, which vibrate.
1013920	1018920	Vibrate of vibration, which is why we can't do it anymore.
1019920	1021920	But there is a chance he might watch this and be like,
1021920	1022920	what did you do today?
1022920	1024920	Because he finds it fascinating.
1024920	1026920	He's like, how did you earn that much money?
1026920	1029920	And I was like, oh, like, I believe in consistency.
1029920	1032920	I believe in an exchange of goods and services.
1032920	1037920	I was like explaining, like, we are being observed.
1037920	1038920	Yes.
1038920	1042920	I was explaining to him, like, the way I like to say thank you
1042920	1045920	is I like to provide more content.
1046920	1051920	So I have a disclaimer in my short that says how much I earned.
1051920	1054920	Basically, it's over 10K.
1054920	1057920	Because you guys are stupendously supportive.
1057920	1060920	But yeah, in my first month of strong calls,
1060920	1063920	I made over $10,000.
1063920	1066920	Because you guys are fucking insane.
1066920	1069920	I also break down the income via Patreon, stream elements,
1069920	1072920	and what I earned on YouTube.
1072920	1074920	Nothing you don't deserve.
1074920	1076920	I find it hard to accept.
1076920	1078920	I'm going to be honest.
1078920	1080920	That is a...
1080920	1083920	You know how, like, people were like, oh,
1083920	1085920	we need to support her more.
1085920	1087920	You give me more than enough.
1087920	1089920	We're funding Gen2.
1089920	1093920	Look, my Donathon is an October 10th.
1093920	1097920	At this rate, the Donathon end of goal is going to be like
1097920	1101920	$5,000 Gen2 production confirmed at this rate.
1101920	1103920	I'm going to be honest.
1103920	1105920	You will accept her money and you're going to like it.
1105920	1109920	Well, at least let me fucking get some ASMR in exchange.
1109920	1112920	And you were worried about funding Gen2.
1112920	1114920	Literally, I'm not being funny.
1114920	1118920	Originally, my Gen2 goal was going to be like
1118920	1121920	I think $15,000 US was my end goal.
1121920	1123920	And I would have things all the way.
1123920	1127920	And at the end, it would be like Gen2 confirmed production.
1127920	1131920	Motherfucker, I'm going to do it with like $300 at this rate.
1131920	1133920	VTuber community support.
1133920	1135920	It's actually insane.
1135920	1138920	It's genuinely insane.
1138920	1140920	Some had a year of build up.
1140920	1142920	I couldn't hold it.
1142920	1146920	This is terrible.
1146920	1149920	She said she was supported enough time to support her.
1149920	1151920	No, seriously.
1151920	1154920	So I broke down the income, but I had to see a few disclaimers.
1154920	1157920	My disclaimers, like, I stream every single day.
1157920	1160920	I can't remember my other ones.
1160920	1161920	But I did have disclaimers.
1161920	1163920	And then at the end, I was like,
1163920	1166920	I remember to hold 30% for tax purposes.
1166920	1169920	Like, I sounded so depressed at the end.
1169920	1170920	You deserve it.
1170920	1173920	You're basically a comfort streamer for all good.
1173920	1175920	Even with my wee accent.
1175920	1177920	Yeah, am I your comfort streamer putting you to sleep?
1177920	1181920	My only gripe is having to pay 5 or 10% of that taxes to the company.
1181920	1184920	You beat 10% taxes.
1184920	1187920	What country do you live in, Luxembourg?
1187920	1189920	10%?
1189920	1191920	10%?
1191920	1193920	What the fuck?
1193920	1195920	I'm, like, 30%.
1195920	1197920	Hmm.
1197920	1199920	Accent's part of why I come back every day.
1199920	1201920	You're like that.
1201920	1202920	You're like that.
1202920	1205920	And then, see, that accent is getting you 10K.
1205920	1207920	I don't think that I'm not being funny.
1207920	1210920	My Donaldson goal is not going to be 10K at this rate.
1210920	1212920	Like, the end goal, you know how it's like,
1212920	1214920	oh, my goal has been achieved.
1214920	1216920	Right, here's extended.
1217920	1218920	No.
1218920	1224920	I have put in a plushy request for a certain MILF goddess.
1224920	1226920	Goddess of fertility.
1226920	1228920	Pardon my French, not MILF.
1228920	1232920	I have put in a request about a plushy for a bleeding heart.
1232920	1234920	So I'm going to see what the response is.
1234920	1238920	And depending on that, we either do a different business
1238920	1241920	or see what happens, I don't know.
1241920	1246920	But I am starting to mildly prepare for Azur's donathon.
1246920	1250920	Her birthday donathon starts and immediately ends.
1250920	1252920	I'm not being funny, but I'm starting to think
1252920	1254920	that's what's going to happen.
1254920	1255920	I don't want to predict the future,
1255920	1260920	but I'm getting nervous for how little the actual end goal is.
1260920	1263920	It's going to be, like, Gen 2 production confirmed.
1263920	1264920	$69.
1264920	1265920	There you go.
1265920	1266920	When is Azur's birthday?
1266920	1268920	The 21st of August.
1268920	1270920	Now, I know I'm being a bit pre-emptive,
1270920	1272920	but a month and a week and two weeks and a...
1272920	1275920	Just change the goal at Gen 3 while you're at it.
1275920	1277920	Honestly, at this rate.
1277920	1280920	Hmm.
1280920	1282920	Just add more goals then.
1282920	1284920	Thankfully, I do have very good stretch goals,
1284920	1287920	which I think everyone's going to be quite happy with.
1287920	1290920	I am focusing on more public access things.
1290920	1293920	Maybe, you know, free.
1293920	1296920	Actually, that reminds me, I need to edit so much for Twitter.
1296920	1298920	I'll turn it off.
1299920	1301920	And...
1301920	1304920	And I've got a Bible movement inside me.
1304920	1306920	Stretch goals.
1306920	1308920	Quite literally.
1308920	1311920	Yeah.
1311920	1313920	The rest goes to the shareholders.
1313920	1316920	Hmm, yes, we have shareholders.
1316920	1320920	Anyway, done with the high table while we're at it.
1320920	1323920	Okay, I have hydration.
1323920	1325920	Hmm.
1325920	1329920	The community posts in the community-related videos are quite good, yes.
1329920	1331920	It's my first one doing it.
1331920	1334920	I was like, I want to do a 60-minute, like, triggers.
1334920	1338920	So I'm going to take screenshots of the ones that I want to see.
1338920	1340920	Now, I don't want anyone being...
1340920	1343920	Having a sorbuti, because I've no peggio for one.
1343920	1347920	But then you have a sorbuti if I didn't pick the phrase or thing you've asked me.
1347920	1352920	It's not like it's the only one I'm going to be doing, okay?
1352920	1354920	Hello, America Hiya!
1354920	1356920	You're my goal and I want to straight...
1356920	1358920	That's terrible.
1358920	1361920	She says one of her goals is literally a figurine.
1361920	1363920	That's a tentacle.
1363920	1365920	Can we be a bit mean with the phrases?
1365920	1367920	Yes, most certainly.
1367920	1369920	I have absolutely no issues with that.
1369920	1371920	Okay, so we are lovely cane.
1371920	1373920	No, we're not going to do boss rush.
1373920	1375920	I'm just going to talk through it.
1375920	1381920	So you can actually see we have a lucky foot pixel on our right foot.
1381920	1384920	See how it's like a bit red?
1384920	1387920	We've got a sacrifice room, which no, we are not messing with.
1387920	1391920	But there is a chance the fires can drop a cheeky coin for us.
1391920	1394920	Cane is smooth like butter.
1394920	1397920	We did pick about one a wee coin.
1397920	1399920	You also have the best drink ever.
1399920	1401920	Good smile collab when steady on.
1401920	1403920	I think we need a wee bit more numbers now.
1403920	1406920	I'm not much of a number whole bag,
1406920	1410920	but I have to admit when it comes to contacting companies like that,
1410920	1412920	I kind of need the...
1412920	1414920	Oh God, these blow up.
1414920	1416920	Oh no.
1418920	1420920	Okay, I am not good at Isaac.
1420920	1422920	So if I could just get Godhead, that would be...
1422920	1424920	I don't even think I've unlocked Godhead.
1424920	1427920	You know, there's so many items I've yet to unlock.
1429920	1432920	But yes, we're just having a chill day on Isaac.
1432920	1434920	I get to nerd about it because I love it.
1434920	1436920	And I can't wait to play multiplayer Isaac with you.
1436920	1438920	See these spiders?
1438920	1439920	See you.
1439920	1440920	One shot, yeah.
1440920	1442920	Oh, and it unlocks a new spider.
1442920	1444920	Just to really upset me, yeah.
1444920	1448920	I am taking damage in unclear room,
1448920	1450920	grants flight,
1450920	1452920	spectral tears,
1452920	1455920	stops time greatly increases speed and fire rate.
1455920	1458920	I mean, we have to take damage to activate it,
1458920	1462920	but I mean, it's better than nothing.
1463920	1465920	Okay, we'll grab this.
1466920	1467920	Godhead.
1467920	1469920	Cast the gate that enemies with the Godhead.
1469920	1471920	I keep forgetting you can slowly move if you're on a controller.
1471920	1473920	Oh yeah, I'm a controller.
1473920	1474920	I'm not moving.
1474920	1475920	Oh, you didn't see that.
1475920	1476920	No, that's it.
1479920	1480920	Wait, why is it so small?
1480920	1482920	Why can't I make it bigger?
1482920	1484920	No, I feel like manual...
1484920	1485920	Oh my God.
1485920	1486920	No, don't.
1486920	1487920	This is embarrassing.
1487920	1488920	I like...
1488920	1489920	Stop.
1489920	1491920	I like accidentally minimized it.
1491920	1492920	It won't let it go big.
1492920	1493920	Stop.
1493920	1494920	That's so embarrassing.
1494920	1497920	It won't let it go big again.
1497920	1498920	Get big.
1498920	1500920	What are you doing?
1500920	1501920	Oh my God.
1501920	1502920	Right.
1502920	1503920	Hold on.
1503920	1505920	That's actually so embarrassing.
1505920	1507920	Okay, that's the best I can do.
1507920	1509920	I don't know how I managed that,
1509920	1511920	but what's done is done.
1511920	1514920	Press F.
1514920	1516920	Alt return to full...
1516920	1517920	Alt return.
1517920	1518920	Stop.
1518920	1519920	I'll actually believe you.
1519920	1520920	But the heck is return?
1520920	1522920	Return isn't a button on the keyboard.
1522920	1524920	Oh my God, it is F.
1524920	1526920	The reeflings told the truth.
1526920	1527920	The reeflings loved me.
1527920	1529920	They didn't tell me to Alt F4.
1530920	1531920	Hold on.
1532920	1533920	Yay.
1533920	1534920	Thank you, reefling.
1536920	1537920	Who said Alt?
1537920	1538920	Alt owner.
1538920	1539920	Look at you.
1539920	1540920	I actually being nice to you.
1540920	1541920	What the heck?
1541920	1543920	See, other streamer communities
1543920	1544920	would have trolled the fuck.
1544920	1546920	I'm like, uh, uh, uh, actually panicking.
1547920	1549920	Oh, I don't like those guys.
1551920	1553920	I don't like burning basement.
1553920	1555920	Actually, well, I'm at it.
1555920	1557920	I don't like any enemies in Isaac
1557920	1559920	because they're all meanie-boo beanies.
1560920	1562920	Please don't jump into the fire.
1562920	1564920	Because when he jump into the fire,
1564920	1566920	he gets higher and higher.
1566920	1571920	Can we get much higher and higher?
1572920	1573920	Stay.
1573920	1574920	No, we don't need that.
1575920	1576920	What we got?
1576920	1577920	We got useless.
1578920	1580920	We don't even have enough for it.
1580920	1582920	And it's an unidentified film.
1583920	1586920	Not even Larry Junior?
1587920	1588920	I don't know.
1588920	1589920	I hate this, the sailors,
1589920	1590920	because it fills spiders.
1590920	1593920	Otherwise, other ways for sure.
1593920	1594920	But I like that.
1594920	1595920	What do you mean?
1595920	1596920	We never billy or troll you forever.
1596920	1598920	Okay, this isn't actually the worst jewel.
1598920	1601920	I'm kind of wanting to get rid of the baby guy first
1601920	1603920	because he's a bit of a headache.
1603920	1605920	Oh, it's not going to happen.
1605920	1607920	It's not going to happen.
1607920	1608920	It's fine.
1609920	1610920	Watch me get...
1615920	1617920	Yeah, unfortunately, when he gets untethered,
1617920	1619920	he has quite interesting physics,
1619920	1622920	which I don't like going off against.
1624920	1626920	I don't know, maybe we can just do that.
1627920	1628920	Are you joking me?
1628920	1630920	The one thing I didn't want was to go against him.
1630920	1631920	Empty heart.
1631920	1634920	Taking damage as a chance to spawn a red heart.
1636920	1638920	Okay, hold on.
1639920	1642920	Now, we could maybe get insanely...
1642920	1644920	Oh my god, it's a wake-up.
1645920	1648920	We could maybe get insanely,
1648920	1654920	insanely lucky on these sacrificial spikes.
1654920	1660920	Due to old vantage, has a chance to spawn hearts.
1660920	1661920	Okay.
1663920	1664920	Okay, hold on.
1664920	1666920	And then we have two hearts back here.
1666920	1668920	So you'll notice we pee now at the door.
1668920	1670920	When your health is hidden,
1670920	1672920	that will tell you if you're in trouble or not.
1672920	1674920	So we're peeing because we have a half a heart.
1674920	1676920	So we're going to pick up these double hearts here.
1676920	1678920	Yummy, yummy, juicy, juicy.
1679920	1680920	What?
1684920	1685920	Aww.
1685920	1688920	Why does the message only say faces on screen?
1688920	1689920	I'll make you change that.
1689920	1692920	Thank you very much to me, Tim Schottel.
1693920	1694920	Thank you.
1695920	1696920	For your kind tip.
1696920	1697920	I appreciate it.
1697920	1699920	Does that actually mean...
1699920	1700920	We got a sack?
1700920	1701920	Oh my gosh.
1701920	1703920	Wait, that was actually a really good story.
1704920	1705920	Oh, and we got a heart back.
1706920	1709920	Come on, surely we'll get an S tier item.
1709920	1710920	Literally S tier.
1711920	1712920	And we got a heart back.
1714920	1716920	Oh my god, we're actually doing so good.
1720920	1722920	What do I need to do?
1723920	1725920	Do I need to sacrifice that wee guy?
1725920	1726920	I think so.
1728920	1730920	I think I'm going to have to sacrifice that heart.
1730920	1731920	You know that?
1734920	1735920	Okay, we're not...
1737920	1739920	Oh no, it's behind this.
1739920	1741920	Oh, I wouldn't have done that had I known.
1742920	1744920	And seeing Gamble luck, I thought it was going to drop.
1744920	1746920	I just realized we can probably just...
1746920	1747920	die in this room.
1748920	1751920	If one of the bombs ricochet...
1751920	1753920	Oh god, get me out, get me out, right.
1753920	1754920	Safe, safe, safe.
1754920	1756920	Right, what's the card?
1756920	1758920	Teleports Isaac to the shop, sure.
1758920	1759920	Okay, we are going to...
1759920	1761920	Oh no, we don't have enough health.
1763920	1764920	Oh, I shouldn't have picked that up.
1764920	1766920	I could have bought one from the shop.
1766920	1767920	You know that?
1767920	1769920	What have I done?
1770920	1771920	What have I done?
1772920	1773920	You have to kill me.
1773920	1774920	I'm going to kill you.
1774920	1775920	What have I done?
1775920	1776920	You have to kill an angel.
1776920	1777920	No, you can actually...
1777920	1779920	There's not a heart in the shop.
1780920	1781920	Are you serious?
1785920	1787920	If we do not get Gibbon...
1788920	1790920	a heart when we stand on the spike,
1790920	1793920	I don't think we can pick up our reward.
1794920	1796920	We need a heart to draw.
1797920	1798920	I literally...
1799920	1800920	Alright, bye.
1804920	1805920	Are you serious?
1805920	1806920	We need...
1806920	1808920	We need a smithereen of a heart.
1808920	1810920	We're going to have to actually buy that card in the shop
1810920	1812920	and hope it's the lover's card,
1812920	1814920	which gives us two red hearts.
1820920	1822920	I have been trolled.
1823920	1825920	I have been trolled.
1826920	1828920	The super secret room, maybe.
1835920	1836920	I mean, we'll pop it.
1836920	1838920	Oh, I knew the secret room was there.
1839920	1840920	Alright, hold on.
1840920	1842920	I'm doing it from this side, though.
1842920	1845920	Please have something in it for me.
1847920	1848920	No.
1850920	1852920	It's just money.
1853920	1855920	So where's the other room?
1855920	1857920	Is it down here?
1857920	1860920	I thought it might be here or there.
1861920	1864920	I don't like this map play out.
1864920	1866920	I hate when the maps...
1866920	1868920	I mean, it could be an elbow.
1868920	1869920	Which is here.
1869920	1871920	We'll only have one bomb left.
1872920	1873920	Buy the pill.
1873920	1875920	Maybe it's a full health.
1879920	1883920	I can't believe we did all the sacrificing for nothing.
1884920	1885920	Come on, pill.
1887920	1888920	Tears up.
1888920	1889920	I mean...
1889920	1890920	It's alright.
1891920	1894920	Oh, that's so unlucky.
1895920	1897920	What shop doesn't have a freaking heart?
1897920	1899920	And there's no heart that dropped here.
1902920	1904920	There could be something behind here.
1904920	1905920	Money.
1906920	1908920	Not what we wanted.
1909920	1912920	Super secret room isn't next to any other room.
1912920	1914920	Yeah, it can be, can't it?
1914920	1915920	Gamble over.
1915920	1916920	I believe in the sack luck.
1916920	1919920	There'll be nothing inside that we can utilize.
1920920	1922920	Yeah, a bomb and a key.
1923920	1926920	That is so unlucky.
1927920	1929920	Wait, is that actual?
1929920	1932920	Not me learning that Super Secret Room only has one connected to it.
1932920	1934920	Well, then it can't be elbow.
1934920	1936920	It has to be like one of these weird ones here.
1937920	1939920	My guess is opposite of the shop.
1939920	1940920	We're doing it once.
1940920	1942920	I don't want to waste my bombs.
1942920	1944920	Well, I've wasted my bomb.
1946920	1948920	I can't believe that.
1948920	1950920	We were one away from greatness.
1950920	1951920	Oh well.
1951920	1952920	We tried, we tried.
1952920	1955920	We can maybe do a bit better on the next floor, okay?
1955920	1957920	Womp, womp, womp.
1957920	1958920	Terrible luck.
1959920	1963920	I should feel ashamed of myself for how terrible that luck was.
1965920	1968920	Shops, treasure rooms and boss rooms don't count as rooms.
1968920	1969920	Great grandpa.
1970920	1972920	Okay, we're just going to pop the hermit then now.
1972920	1976920	Because normally we do get spawned in.
1976920	1979920	God, what a trinket now.
1981920	1983920	Again, there's no healing in here.
1983920	1986920	The game where it's like, oh god, I really need to not mess up
1986920	1988920	or this is going to lose my run.
1993920	1994920	Okay.
1994920	1996920	Got a bomb back from him.
1998920	2001920	Okay, hopefully there's something good in this suite.
2001920	2004920	Oh, there is a chest here we can get into for free.
2004920	2007920	We just need to sacrifice a bomb for it.
2008920	2010920	I know, I know you're like, oh, strong eight,
2010920	2012920	where did you get these MLG skills?
2012920	2014920	I know, I'm just so good at Isaac.
2014920	2015920	What do you mean I get super lucky?
2015920	2018920	And the only reason I win runs is because I get like,
2018920	2020920	I love Spoonbender.
2020920	2022920	It's my favorite item.
2022920	2024920	Because you don't have to aim.
2024920	2026920	I love Spoonbender.
2027920	2028920	We got a cheeky heart.
2028920	2030920	Let's see what's in here.
2030920	2032920	Slows down enemies, deals 10 damage.
2032920	2034920	I mean, it's a fill room damage.
2034920	2036920	We don't even have an active item.
2036920	2038920	Right, we're going to pop this.
2039920	2041920	Is there a tenant rock?
2046920	2049920	Hey mom, hi broly legend.
2049920	2051920	We've got started.
2051920	2053920	We're doing...
2053920	2055920	I was actually lucky.
2055920	2057920	Okay, now we have tons of keys.
2057920	2058920	Just like that.
2058920	2060920	We are playing...
2060920	2062920	Isaac Kane,
2062920	2064920	and we can huff pills on Kane.
2064920	2066920	We love Casting Spills.
2066920	2068920	I hate...
2068920	2070920	I hate when the enemies do that.
2070920	2072920	Sorry.
2072920	2074920	Someone's getting the boot.
2076920	2078920	We got two pills though.
2078920	2080920	Luck.
2080920	2082920	Experimental HP up.
2082920	2084920	See, where were you when we needed you most?
2084920	2085920	Hmm?
2085920	2087920	Could have used my ultimate.
2088920	2090920	Spoon, Bender and Brimstone.
2090920	2092920	Oh yeah, that's exactly what I like.
2092920	2094920	Thank you broly legend for the fine.
2094920	2097920	You missed it, but I was talking about
2097920	2100920	how supportive the reeflings are
2100920	2102920	and how my...
2102920	2104920	God, it's because my luck is so high.
2104920	2107920	Now we have an increased rate for chest drops,
2107920	2109920	which gives multiple items.
2109920	2111920	I don't know if I want to go in there yet.
2111920	2113920	What, we got 100% Devil Deal?
2113920	2116920	I don't know if we're doing Devil Deal.
2116920	2118920	Phew, you cheeky cheekerton.
2120920	2122920	I prefer the Angel Deal
2122920	2124920	because you don't have to sacrifice anyhow.
2124920	2126920	Ooh.
2126920	2128920	Devil's Isaac's Coins.
2128920	2131920	Ooh, okay, okay, okay.
2131920	2134920	What was in the shop again? Was it anything of value?
2134920	2136920	No.
2138920	2140920	One luck, double it in that.
2141920	2143920	Shops aren't being very kind to me today.
2143920	2145920	Brim is the Devil item though.
2145920	2147920	No, but...
2147920	2149920	What happens if I got Sacred Heart though?
2149920	2151920	Smile.
2151920	2153920	Oh come on, don't...
2153920	2155920	I hate these guys when they hide behind rocks.
2155920	2157920	You know what you're doing, eh?
2157920	2159920	Yeah, exactly, as soon as I get closer to it.
2159920	2160920	What does it do?
2160920	2162920	Freaking jumps closer to the screen.
2162920	2163920	That's right.
2163920	2164920	That's right.
2164920	2165920	You're done for.
2165920	2167920	Get rekt, get rekt.
2167920	2169920	I knew it, I knew it.
2169920	2171920	Probably Isaac's.
2171920	2173920	Um...
2173920	2176920	Another hermit, surprisingly enough.
2176920	2177920	Sacred Heart is better.
2177920	2178920	Breath of life incoming.
2178920	2180920	Stop, if that's my first item.
2181920	2183920	Okay, it's fine, it's fine.
2186920	2188920	Uh...
2188920	2189920	Steady on.
2189920	2191920	Oh god, my analogue stick's kinda...
2191920	2193920	Gonna look funny.
2193920	2196920	Bomba, no tinted rock.
2198920	2200920	Get rid of that.
2201920	2204920	See what you're gonna draw behind you.
2204920	2206920	Okay, that's fine, it's fine, it's fine.
2206920	2210920	Right, so because there's nothing here,
2210920	2212920	it makes me think, oh no, I can't be here.
2212920	2214920	What the heck are the secret rooms in this map?
2214920	2216920	Down, straight down.
2216920	2218920	Elbow maybe?
2219920	2221920	And then one here?
2223920	2225920	Yeah, okay.
2225920	2227920	We're gonna...
2228920	2231920	Now you can get pills from...
2234920	2237920	From the mushrooms, so I think I am gonna
2237920	2239920	spend some bombs on these.
2240920	2242920	Yes, that's what we wanted.
2242920	2245920	I'm drowsy, no, oh no, I don't...
2249920	2251920	Ah, right, what a waste.
2253920	2255920	Draft, draft, double draft, but it's fine.
2255920	2257920	It's fine, you can't win them all, smile.
2257920	2259920	Hopefully we'll get a key beggar.
2260920	2262920	Slow down.
2262920	2264920	What? What kind of room is this?
2264920	2266920	Oh, hold on, let's pop this right now.
2268920	2271920	Yes, we definitely would like a slow down effect,
2271920	2273920	I say, as the or is already sped up.
2273920	2276920	You were like slow for a millisecond, please.
2276920	2280920	I don't have the tears or benefit of any of this yet.
2280920	2283920	I literally have like super passive items.
2283920	2286920	The only reason we have a stat up is because of...
2288920	2289920	What's it called?
2289920	2291920	Because of...
2293920	2294920	Pills.
2294920	2296920	Because we have astral projection,
2296920	2299920	which it gets me a thing if I get damaged.
2299920	2302920	Lucky bandage is passive and so is lucky key.
2304920	2305920	Oh, please, just perish.
2305920	2307920	Actually, I will say one thing I like about the monster design.
2307920	2310920	If you look at this monster, he has a cleft palate,
2310920	2313920	which is when your little schnozer in your mouth connect.
2313920	2316920	You can get it fixed in surgery, it's not a big deal.
2316920	2318920	But I like that the designs are quite...
2318920	2322920	There's quite a few diagnoses that turned into bosses,
2322920	2323920	which I think is pretty cool.
2323920	2324920	I mean, I thought it was pretty cool.
2324920	2326920	Oh god, I'm so tempted to go inside.
2326920	2329920	Ruffer's floor, little monstero, yay.
2329920	2331920	But there is quite a few...
2331920	2335920	I'll take the diamond card with me so we can double our money.
2335920	2337920	I know I should have done the cursed room,
2337920	2339920	but I had terrible luck last time.
2339920	2344920	I'd rather sacrifice my health on...
2346920	2348920	On a...
2348920	2351920	Oh, yeah, fuck him up, fuck him up, yeah.
2351920	2353920	Take that, take that.
2356920	2359920	All right, so I get to keep this.
2359920	2361920	I'm just losing all my health.
2361920	2362920	I'm just losing my health, I don't want it.
2362920	2364920	I didn't want my health anyway, I didn't need it.
2364920	2367920	I'm going to lose my angel deal because of this twat.
2368920	2370920	Oh, goodness' sake.
2370920	2371920	That was terrible.
2371920	2373920	Sorry, I really am just terrible at the game.
2373920	2376920	I'm just popping this right now because I don't trust myself.
2378920	2380920	Yeah, that's...
2380920	2383920	I'm going to need the shops to help me out with something.
2383920	2388920	Give me, like, champions belt, damage up.
2388920	2390920	I'll take that.
2390920	2392920	Black candle...
2392920	2394920	Does that give me a damage up?
2394920	2397920	Give me a damage up and avoid curses?
2397920	2398920	I think so.
2398920	2399920	Money!
2399920	2400920	Boss rush this time?
2400920	2401920	No, you ain't getting it.
2401920	2403920	You excited for the next Ed McMuffin game?
2403920	2405920	It's called Mugenics.
2405920	2407920	I saw gameplay footage of it.
2407920	2412920	I'll be interested to see if it will...
2412920	2414920	Oh, I don't want to take the full heart yet.
2414920	2417920	I'll stay half heart in case there's a sacrifice room.
2417920	2419920	Mugenics looks interesting.
2419920	2423920	I'm not sure how much I...
2423920	2425920	I'm going to enjoy it.
2425920	2429920	It is a perplexing game.
2429920	2431920	From the stuff that I've seen of it.
2431920	2434920	I don't know how the mushrooms work, I'm going to be honest.
2434920	2438920	I don't know if he's going to do a diagonal.
2438920	2441920	I do have time to react though, so I can get out of the way.
2442920	2444920	I hope it's multiplayer.
2444920	2446920	Think big, find chaos in the shop.
2446920	2447920	Wild card.
2447920	2449920	A little bit cheeky chaos.
2450920	2453920	I'm going to play it safe.
2453920	2454920	This guy really...
2454920	2458920	You shouldn't really be taking damage from him once you know what's up.
2458920	2462920	I'm just playing mega safe because I lost all my hearts
2462920	2464920	and I really want to get an angel deal.
2469920	2470920	He just perished him.
2470920	2472920	He's like, I've had enough.
2472920	2473920	A large bomb.
2473920	2475920	Well, we'll touch it anyway,
2475920	2478920	but I think it actually prefers slowing.
2479920	2482920	The large bomb would help with the enemy though.
2482920	2486920	I don't have flay and before it drops like a coin.
2486920	2488920	I don't have flay.
2488920	2489920	Give me...
2489920	2492920	Yeah, I was going to say counterfeit penny.
2492920	2493920	I don't have flay.
2493920	2495920	Maybe I'll get flay in a sec.
2498920	2502920	If I do actually win this smile.
2502920	2505920	Right, I beg, give me something good.
2509920	2510920	You didn't see it,
2510920	2514920	but I just violently put my head backwards out of annoyance.
2522920	2525920	Well, this bomb in exchange of seven is worth it,
2525920	2527920	so we'll grab that.
2527920	2529920	Wait, use it to become flying.
2530920	2531920	Refling?
2531920	2534920	Can I teleport you into my brain right now?
2534920	2535920	Oh my God.
2535920	2537920	Why are you so smart?
2537920	2538920	Why?
2540920	2541920	Okay.
2541920	2544920	The question is, do we take counterfeit penny or not?
2545920	2547920	Did we do it?
2547920	2549920	Did we go out on economy?
2552920	2553920	Yes.
2553920	2555920	Because we have a good drop rate.
2555920	2557920	We're doing economy.
2557920	2558920	I should have picked that up first, idiot.
2558920	2559920	Anyway.
2559920	2561920	Right, grab this first.
2562920	2563920	And then we'll go back to this.
2563920	2564920	Refling, you're so smart.
2564920	2566920	Right, we're going to pop our diamonds.
2566920	2568920	So boom, we've got 48 coins just like that.
2568920	2570920	We are going to pick up the cards
2570920	2572920	because we might get a hierophant.
2572920	2573920	Ooh.
2575920	2577920	Ooh, we got the justies.
2577920	2579920	Okay, we'll just go full health over that.
2579920	2581920	Spawn's a blood donation.
2581920	2583920	Teleports Isaac to the first floor,
2583920	2586920	and then we'll just do angel deal to get it.
2589920	2591920	We got holy man.
2594920	2595920	Oh my Lord.
2596920	2599920	I don't know if I can beat up this angel.
2603920	2605920	I don't think I have the strength to beat him up,
2605920	2606920	but we have holy man.
2606920	2609920	Oh, we'll come back and beat up the angels at a later date.
2609920	2611920	What we got?
2611920	2613920	Blood donation machine.
2614920	2616920	I'm going to see if there's a sacrifice one.
2616920	2618920	It doesn't look like there is,
2618920	2622920	but we might be able to get a sugar ton of money.
2622920	2623920	Please don't do that.
2623920	2624920	Money.
2626920	2628920	Please stop jumping around the map.
2628920	2629920	You're scaring me.
2632920	2633920	Wah.
2633920	2635920	Now you can go into the curse room for free.
2635920	2637920	You are so right bestie.
2637920	2640920	So I never realized this stuff until you type it out.
2640920	2643920	I'm sure there are tumors that can maximize.
2643920	2646920	Isaac runs down to every little detail.
2646920	2649920	Me, I'm like, oh yeah, you can do that.
2649920	2650920	Can you?
2650920	2651920	Yeah.
2651920	2652920	Right.
2652920	2653920	Let's go grab.
2654920	2657920	I think we'll pop blood donation machine as well.
2662920	2665920	This is why we don't do the curse room.
2669920	2672920	I'm kind of tempted, but I don't want to...
2672920	2674920	If we get back in the angel room,
2674920	2678920	I'll take that as a sign that we are supposed to jump in.
2679920	2681920	We are not taking curse before.
2681920	2684920	And I was like, oh, why don't you take curse today?
2684920	2685920	Do you need to take curse?
2685920	2686920	No.
2687920	2689920	Okay, let's pop this one.
2689920	2693920	Two, three, four.
2694920	2698920	And then grab that and then one, two.
2700920	2703920	Oh, we did get a bandage prop.
2703920	2704920	Oh, there we go.
2704920	2705920	That's what we want.
2705920	2706920	We want the...
2706920	2709920	We want the bandage train.
2709920	2712920	Well, someone please think of the bandages.
2712920	2715920	We might be able to get blood at IV bag.
2715920	2718920	If we get IV bag, we're in the money
2718920	2721920	because IV puts off our speed.
2723920	2725920	Here we go for it, I think so.
2725920	2726920	Oh, there you go.
2728920	2731920	I think we're going to go and roll for IV bag
2732920	2736920	because it puts our speed up and gives us another health slot.
2736920	2737920	What did you call me?
2737920	2738920	Yeah, that's right.
2738920	2739920	I called you that.
2740920	2743920	We're also going to put money in the donation machine in general
2743920	2746920	because that will raise our floor luck.
2747920	2748920	Okay, I stick.
2748920	2749920	There we go.
2749920	2750920	Yeah, you better start proking.
2750920	2753920	Shawnee breaking the economy feels good, man.
2754920	2756920	I became the very thing I swore to destroy.
2756920	2760920	Oh, come on, pop.
2762920	2764920	Oh, no, no, this can't be.
2764920	2766920	Right, we're going to grab this health.
2766920	2767920	We're at 84 economy.
2767920	2768920	Don't mind if I do.
2769920	2770920	Shawnee, this is a lot.
2772920	2773920	Weezer build?
2773920	2775920	Are you making fun of my build?
2776920	2778920	Getting billy though.
2778920	2782920	Right, we don't have anything else we can really utilize.
2782920	2783920	Tell for Isaac.
2783920	2785920	Right, first things first.
2785920	2786920	We'll just double the bombs now.
2786920	2787920	Get out of the way.
2787920	2789920	Bunk and then do that.
2789920	2793920	And then buy you the world.
2795920	2797920	It's probably better using on the next floor.
2797920	2801920	We're going to put away some money so we can increase our luck
2801920	2804920	and angel deal per chance.
2806920	2808920	Or we'll just jam it and get nothing.
2810920	2812920	Not like I wanted anything anyway.
2813920	2816920	Right, four.
2816920	2817920	What do we need?
2817920	2818920	We've got eight key.
2818920	2819920	I mean, we have plenty.
2821920	2822920	We'll keep the world for next.
2822920	2824920	You already have Nightmare Penny in the shop.
2824920	2825920	Yes, I've done that before already.
2825920	2827920	And then I blew it up.
2828920	2833920	We'll just bomb this because we can't donate into it anymore,
2833920	2835920	but we can get the monies out of it.
2835920	2840920	Now, our great chance fight for the shop does go up exponentially.
2843920	2844920	Okay, wait.
2844920	2845920	So what is here?
2847920	2848920	Okay.
2848920	2850920	That was gamer sense before.
2850920	2851920	And it was like, are you?
2853920	2855920	There was a poop in here then.
2855920	2857920	All time we could have got IV bag.
2857920	2858920	We could have fully healed.
2860920	2863920	We could have fully healed, but did we?
2863920	2864920	No.
2864920	2865920	Yeah, no.
2865920	2869920	Of course, I destroyed the machine before finding the room.
2869920	2870920	Okay.
2870920	2871920	What is it?
2871920	2872920	Versus pestilence.
2872920	2878920	So unfortunately, we don't get what is considered a normal boss kind of item.
2882920	2887920	I really hope the shop is going to start giving us something that helps with fights
2887920	2893920	because unfortunately, our item rooms, they haven't been lacking too much.
2893920	2896920	As I said, the angel deal came in close.
2896920	2900920	Oh, it's not got ahead when she keeps on sucking.
2900920	2901920	You'll lose your hit.
2901920	2904920	That's not how anatomy works at all.
2906920	2908920	We are going to play it careful.
2910920	2911920	I really...
2911920	2916920	Again, as I said, if we do unlock the angel room again, I'm going to blow one up.
2916920	2920920	But it actually is in our best interest to lose this angel percentage
2920920	2923920	because we've already snuck inside and got the item.
2927920	2928920	Motherfucker.
2928920	2930920	Okay, we're going in.
2930920	2931920	Right.
2931920	2934920	Get rid of the fire first because that's such a health hazard.
2934920	2936920	And then we gift a this.
2936920	2938920	Now, if this goes well...
2939920	2941920	Oh, there's a thing there as well.
2941920	2944920	If this goes well, we can actually fully unlock the key.
2944920	2947920	Now, I do have a mod that lets me see where they're going to fire
2947920	2950920	because I'm not good enough to not have it.
2950920	2951920	I ain't that good.
2951920	2952920	I'm not that guy.
2952920	2953920	Trust me.
2953920	2954920	I'm not that guy.
2954920	2959920	We could potentially take on the second angel as well and get the key.
2959920	2964920	So we get two key pieces that will maximize our drop.
2967920	2969920	We are just playing it safe.
2969920	2970920	We did get hit.
2970920	2977920	So unfortunately, my holy mantle is gone, but that's okay.
2977920	2980920	As I said, it's not too bad.
2980920	2981920	I mean, it's alright.
2981920	2984920	I would like to keep our eternal heart.
2984920	2985920	That's what that white heart.
2985920	2994920	If we make it to the next level with it, we will get to keep a whole new red heart.
2994920	2995920	So again, oh, he's red.
2995920	2996920	Oh, he's raging.
2998920	2999920	Slow down, mate.
2999920	3000920	Slow down.
3000920	3001920	Right.
3001920	3002920	You're getting bombed.
3002920	3003920	Honestly.
3003920	3004920	Okay.
3004920	3005920	Well, completely missed.
3005920	3006920	Oh, no.
3006920	3007920	Oh, no.
3007920	3008920	Oh, no.
3008920	3009920	I fucked up.
3009920	3010920	Bruh.
3011920	3012920	Bruh.
3013920	3014920	Stop.
3014920	3015920	Oh, my God.
3015920	3017920	I'm actually going to, I'm going to lose this, please.
3017920	3019920	I would like to remain alive.
3019920	3021920	I would like to remain well.
3021920	3022920	Please get bombed.
3022920	3023920	Oh, my God.
3023920	3025920	The bomb hardly does anything.
3027920	3028920	Oh, my God.
3028920	3029920	Sorry.
3029920	3030920	I am severe.
3030920	3032920	I'm starting to need startups.
3032920	3035920	Yeah, I can see the need for the startups.
3035920	3038920	Please stop this madness.
3039920	3040920	Stop it.
3040920	3041920	Stop it.
3041920	3044920	You're spawning in too many babies.
3044920	3045920	Okay.
3045920	3046920	Okay.
3046920	3047920	Okay.
3047920	3048920	Okay.
3048920	3049920	It's fine.
3049920	3050920	It's fine.
3050920	3051920	We did it.
3051920	3052920	We did it.
3052920	3054920	We just need to take out this baby.
3054920	3055920	Okay.
3055920	3056920	There we go.
3056920	3057920	Oh, okay.
3057920	3062920	We now have increased our angel deal as much as we can outwith like blowing up the shopkeepers,
3062920	3063920	for example.
3064920	3066920	The angel think you're going to produce gen2?
3066920	3067920	Exactly.
3067920	3068920	Unconfirmed?
3068920	3071920	No, we're not doing angel.
3071920	3075920	I'm tempted to go grab that chest.
3075920	3078920	I don't know if it's the wisest thing.
3078920	3086920	I mean, surely with holy mantle and I'm not going to mess it up so badly.
3086920	3087920	Surely.
3087920	3089920	And we could get something out of it.
3089920	3090920	We're going to do it.
3090920	3091920	We're going to do it.
3091920	3092920	Send it.
3092920	3093920	Let's see what we're working with.
3093920	3094920	Okay.
3094920	3095920	That wasn't bad.
3095920	3098920	I just need to not mess up now.
3098920	3099920	Focus.
3099920	3100920	Focus.
3100920	3101920	Focus.
3101920	3102920	Concentrate.
3102920	3103920	Concentration.
3103920	3104920	Patient.
3104920	3105920	Patient.
3105920	3106920	Okay.
3106920	3112920	We're going to pop that on these guys because they like to run at you.
3112920	3113920	Yeah.
3113920	3114920	That's right.
3114920	3115920	I'm on to you.
3115920	3116920	Mm-hmm.
3116920	3117920	Mm-hmm.
3117920	3118920	That's great.
3118920	3119920	That's great.
3119920	3121920	You're doing shrapnel.
3121920	3123920	I've got these guys.
3123920	3124920	Okay.
3124920	3125920	One more phase.
3125920	3128920	Oh, I'm just serious.
3128920	3132920	That's the one thing I could perish this game for.
3132920	3135920	It's like, oh, let me just blow them up.
3135920	3138920	Let me just spawn them on your face and I'm like, no, please don't do that.
3138920	3140920	That's not very nice.
3140920	3143920	Oh, please stop spawning flies.
3143920	3146920	Bro, I ain't got bombs to deal with them.
3146920	3150920	I really don't want to lose my little spiral spiral spirit heart.
3150920	3152920	It's not spirit heart either.
3152920	3154920	Soul heart.
3154920	3155920	I didn't.
3155920	3161920	I mean, we actually didn't come away any worse.
3161920	3164920	I'm catching up at 1.5 speeds.
3164920	3165920	Sorry.
3165920	3170920	You don't understand how many buttons you add the rest of the other hit.
3170920	3173920	I've been left, of course, restoring all the money.
3173920	3176920	Oh, lol.
3176920	3179920	I think I could stand myself at 1.5.
3179920	3183920	She's becoming Neo and dodging every bullet.
3183920	3184920	How is this still open?
3184920	3186920	Normally like shots.
3186920	3188920	Yeah, I was going to say normally shots like that.
3188920	3189920	I hate these guys.
3189920	3192920	Even worse if their brother who spawns 20 million yellow jump inspired.
3192920	3194920	Oh, I hate these booters.
3194920	3195920	GG.
3195920	3197920	Look.
3197920	3198920	Momathon.
3198920	3200920	No risk, no reward.
3200920	3202920	Oh, we got a chest.
3202920	3204920	And before there's nothing in it.
3208920	3211920	I'm going to pop the world card just so we know it's up ahead.
3211920	3212920	That's not bad.
3212920	3214920	If we get a trinket to swallow, then...
3214920	3216920	Oh, we've got a library.
3218920	3220920	That's not bad.
3220920	3223920	Oh, why is it the diagonal?
3223920	3227920	Oh, I hate the diagonal ones.
3227920	3229920	They're so bad.
3229920	3230920	They're so bad.
3230920	3231920	Please.
3231920	3232920	Please.
3232920	3234920	Right, everyone's getting popped right now.
3234920	3236920	I've had enough of yous.
3236920	3238920	Everyone's getting popped.
3238920	3241920	Right, we'll do the secret room and then we'll go to the library.
3241920	3246920	Because if we can get double shot, that should increase our DPS by a bit of considerable output.
3248920	3249920	Okay.
3252920	3255920	I'm going to hopefully get a bomb out of this.
3258920	3261920	We might come back for that trinket.
3261920	3263920	That's not a bad...
3263920	3265920	That is not a bad trinket at all.
3268920	3271920	Not a bad trinket for what we have.
3271920	3273920	Not bad at all.
3276920	3279920	The odds of the shop having...
3281920	3283920	I'm just going to pop that.
3283920	3285920	And it spawned blue spiders for us.
3285920	3287920	The astronomical...
3290920	3291920	I'm going to take HP.
3291920	3292920	Yep.
3293920	3295920	I just knew I should have saved it for this room.
3297920	3299920	I could have seen it was a big room.
3299920	3301920	I knew I was taking damage.
3301920	3303920	These bats are terrible.
3303920	3305920	I think they're called zoo bats in game.
3305920	3307920	I know Pokemon zoo bats.
3307920	3308920	Yes, I know.
3308920	3310920	Please, three books.
3311920	3313920	Close enough and you come.
3315920	3316920	Oh, wait.
3316920	3319920	We just got the angel deal on purpose.
3320920	3322920	But that gives us infinite health.
3324920	3325920	I think...
3325920	3327920	I think we're swapping teams already.
3328920	3330920	It didn't take as long.
3330920	3332920	I think we're swapping teams already.
3332920	3334920	Oh, it's Sissy the spider.
3334920	3335920	Hi, Sissy.
3335920	3337920	Look at the cute little blue spider.
3338920	3342920	That sounded like a silverback gorilla came up behind you and squeezed all the air.
3343920	3344920	I already popped.
3344920	3350920	Your vods are the only ones I've watched at normal speed since you said they spent time is more important than watching the entire vod.
3350920	3352920	Yeah, YouTube's so annoying.
3352920	3355920	I'm literally tempted by the devil unironically.
3355920	3357920	I want to pop it so we have full health.
3360920	3362920	That's terrible.
3362920	3365920	And I just got the angel deal as well.
3365920	3366920	Oh well.
3366920	3370920	I prefer playing safer with full health than anything else.
3370920	3373920	So please forgive I am a bad...
3373920	3376920	Oh, well, that can have gone any worse.
3378920	3381920	Please, I hope this shop has something decent inside.
3381920	3382920	I'm...
3382920	3383920	Or the item room.
3383920	3384920	I'll take the item room out.
3384920	3387920	Oh, Sissy drops me spiders.
3389920	3390920	Is that a bomba?
3390920	3391920	Are you a bomba?
3393920	3398920	Well, we do have a chance to do mega satan if things go in our favor.
3398920	3402920	Whether or not they will, that's different, but you never know.
3402920	3403920	Right.
3404920	3405920	Good item.
3409920	3410920	Are you joking?
3413920	3414920	No, not Keynes.
3414920	3415920	Oh, yuck.
3415920	3418920	My own eye is back.
3418920	3420920	Entering a new floor has a chance.
3420920	3422920	I wish I really need a swallow pill.
3422920	3424920	I need to swallow the trinkets.
3425920	3429920	Oh, it's not a greed fight, but it's absolutely rubbish.
3429920	3431920	You should be ashamed of yourself.
3431920	3432920	What's this?
3432920	3434920	The Emperor challenge mode.
3434920	3436920	What is with these shops?
3436920	3437920	What's that?
3437920	3438920	Five plus bombs.
3438920	3441920	I mean, 15 quid for five bombs isn't terrible.
3441920	3445920	I'll swap out for it and I'm going to see what this pill is all about.
3445920	3446920	Because we've not discovered it.
3446920	3447920	Please be a swallow...
3447920	3448920	pheromones.
3448920	3451920	Okay, thanks for wasting my money.
3451920	3452920	Money.
3453920	3454920	Yeah.
3454920	3457920	I'll give it to the judgment.
3457920	3458920	He's giving me bombs.
3458920	3461920	We do have enough money to go around.
3461920	3462920	Yeah.
3463920	3465920	It's fine.
3465920	3466920	I didn't want...
3466920	3469920	It's not like I wanted a billion trinkets anyway.
3471920	3473920	I think the secret room's below us right now.
3473920	3474920	Because look at...
3474920	3476920	See how flat the wall is.
3478920	3479920	Yeah.
3480920	3481920	You can...
3481920	3484920	Right, we are going to bomb these skulls because there's a chance we get...
3486920	3489920	I said there's a chance we get a black heart from them,
3489920	3491920	but no, no, all of them were like not...
3493920	3494920	Right.
3495920	3498920	Obviously, I've used the keys already to get in the rooms.
3499920	3501920	We've got the hearts for devil deals.
3501920	3502920	Don't say it.
3502920	3503920	Don't make a flat joke.
3503920	3504920	Look.
3507920	3508920	You know what?
3508920	3510920	Speaking of flat.
3511920	3512920	Gen 2.
3512920	3513920	That's right.
3513920	3514920	Get your facts right.
3514920	3515920	I don't know.
3515920	3516920	I'm sorry.
3516920	3517920	I'm dying.
3520920	3521920	But yes.
3521920	3522920	I do have a short.
3522920	3525920	That reveals how much I earned coming out soon.
3526920	3528920	Arissa's been fantastic to work with.
3528920	3531920	She's actually about to do a batch for Sheebie.
3531920	3537920	I think management's about to do a tweet asking for more Ed tours.
3539920	3544920	Because we're kind of sitting about twiddling our thumbs,
3544920	3545920	waiting for other people,
3545920	3549920	and it's like the contents, they're ready to be edited.
3549920	3550920	We're just waiting.
3550920	3555920	And obviously, shorts are very important for the growth of...
3555920	3558920	Oh my God, Sissy is kind of getting it.
3558920	3560920	Sorry, Sissy's doing so well right now.
3560920	3563920	Right, we can't go into the curse for free.
3564920	3570920	So, if you have Ed in...
3570920	3571920	Do we want?
3571920	3572920	If we do read,
3572920	3577920	then we just focus on getting devil deals now.
3578920	3579920	Speaking of that, how is Emmy?
3579920	3581920	Emmy's coming home, didn't you know?
3581920	3583920	She's actually got a stream.
3583920	3585920	She's so excited to stream again.
3585920	3587920	She's like missed her big brother so much.
3588920	3589920	And before I know it's like,
3589920	3590920	that's weird, you're playing into that.
3590920	3591920	Fuck you.
3591920	3593920	People enjoy things consensually.
3593920	3595920	Fucking relax, okay?
3595920	3597920	Right, I'm going to bomb him.
3597920	3599920	Oh, I haven't got money.
3600920	3602920	We are going to get a devil deal,
3602920	3604920	a bit of a devil deal.
3605920	3608920	We're going to keep the book on our persons.
3608920	3610920	I like it because I like planes to proceed
3610920	3612920	with like infinite health respawn.
3613920	3615920	Do we keep?
3616920	3619920	I think actually, you know what we're going to pick up?
3620920	3627920	We are going to pick up the restock trinket.
3627920	3630920	And we're going to say goodbye to counterfeit penny.
3630920	3631920	You've done fantastic.
3631920	3633920	You've absolutely boosted our economy out the wazoo.
3633920	3635920	But now that we have 4% luck,
3635920	3639920	our drop rate is high enough to enjoy what it's worth.
3639920	3642920	Play into your gen mates theme, thinking.
3642920	3643920	How dare...
3643920	3646920	Motherfucker, I created Emmy in that image.
3646920	3648920	I'm sorry, I see this again.
3648920	3650920	Emmy is created in my image.
3650920	3653920	If I had a lighter voice, it would be over for you fuckers.
3653920	3654920	It would...
3654920	3655920	How did I already get hit?
3655920	3657920	Was I not paying attention?
3659920	3661920	God, I really need some devil,
3661920	3663920	good devil items to come through.
3665920	3667920	She's like everything I want to be.
3669920	3672920	Small, cute, adorable, absolutely outrageous, yes.
3673920	3677920	But I don't have a light voice, so I can't do that.
3679920	3681920	Unless you guys want like...
3681920	3683920	Was it the gap mo?
3683920	3685920	I remember when you guys taught me what gap mo means.
3685920	3687920	I was like gap mo, huh?
3687920	3688920	What does that mean?
3689920	3692920	Unless you want the gap mo to be astronomical,
3692920	3695920	and we just end up getting a lollipop version of me.
3695920	3697920	And I still sound the exact same.
3697920	3699920	My voice doesn't change at all.
3699920	3701920	I'm just like, who goes, how's it going?
3701920	3702920	I'm strong here.
3702920	3704920	Do you mean it looks cool that you knew?
3704920	3705920	Why?
3706920	3707920	What is gap mo?
3707920	3711920	Gap mo is when you're designing your voice
3711920	3712920	and attitudes and...
3712920	3713920	Are you joking?
3713920	3714920	Don't...
3719920	3720920	Give me that.
3722920	3723920	Right.
3724920	3727920	We've got two orbitals now.
3727920	3729920	That didn't do anything.
3731920	3733920	And there's nothing in the shop.
3733920	3734920	Right, okay.
3734920	3735920	There's no point in hanging about
3735920	3737920	if we didn't get the devil deal.
3737920	3738920	Right, off we pop.
3740920	3741920	I want a lollipop.
3741920	3742920	You're going to gap mo.
3742920	3744920	I'm going to gap mo all over you.
3744920	3746920	Petition for saying all the letters in mo.
3746920	3747920	Moe.
3747920	3748920	Oh, gap moe.
3748920	3750920	I want lollipop strong now.
3750920	3752920	Honestly, that'd be hilarious.
3754920	3755920	I don't...
3755920	3756920	I wouldn't mind it.
3756920	3757920	I think that would be funny.
3757920	3758920	It's probably being like,
3758920	3759920	Hi guys, how's it going?
3759920	3760920	I'm strong here.
3760920	3761920	Like in my deep voice.
3761920	3762920	Everyone's like,
3762920	3764920	You don't sound like you think at all.
3764920	3765920	Oh, I peed myself.
3767920	3769920	Thank you, Broly Legend, for the tip.
3769920	3770920	Um...
3772920	3773920	I'm sorry.
3773920	3774920	I'm sorry.
3774920	3775920	I'm sorry.
3775920	3776920	I'm sorry.
3776920	3777920	I'm sorry.
3778920	3779920	What?
3780920	3783920	See, this isn't the thing about Binding of Isaac.
3783920	3785920	You can play so much
3785920	3788920	and you end up getting like the most random rooms
3788920	3790920	you've never seen in your life before.
3790920	3791920	I can see that tinted rocks.
3791920	3792920	I'm just gonna...
3793920	3794920	Oh, and it misses both of them.
3796920	3797920	You know what I think about you?
3797920	3799920	You farts, honestly.
3800920	3801920	Honestly.
3802920	3804920	We are needing stat up.
3804920	3810320	We are needing stat-ups, we're needing pills, we're needing anything because this is getting
3810320	3812840	a bit of a donk y'all aren't you mate?
3812840	3821960	Okay, we're gonna pop this so we're definitely gonna have high priestess.
3821960	3826000	There may be sacrifice room on floor, maybe?
3826000	3831600	Oh, I wasn't paying attention sorry.
3832600	3837600	Hmm, I've never seen that if only you could throw keys at an enemy.
3837600	3841600	Hey wait a minute that's an item.
3841600	3845600	Just out of curiosity is there a girl and veeler that isn't in a pet play?
3845600	3846600	What?
3846600	3849440	Wait until you hear the logic behind it.
3849440	3853120	Remember that time I told you guys that women don't like it if you treat animals cruelly?
3853120	3855120	Hmm, I wonder why, smile.
3855120	3857440	Oh for goodness sake!
3858440	3863440	You're so dramatic, you're so dramatic Keen, get up!
3863440	3867440	Is that a double tinted rock behind the skull?
3867440	3869440	Am I going crazy?
3869440	3873440	No it is a double tinted rock, I knew it!
3873440	3876440	I knew it was a double tinted rock.
3880440	3886440	I know we don't have to kill this but out of principle perish.
3886440	3892440	Again these red fires can only shoot one fire at you, they can't shoot anymore.
3892440	3896440	So don't get too scared now, don't hurt them now.
3896440	3900440	Okay so we do have that knife orbital so we can play a bit dangerous.
3900440	3907440	If we time it correctly we can just jam the knife in the enemies but you know you have to make sure you don't mess it up.
3907440	3909440	Or else you're just taking XP damage.
3909440	3913440	Although we do have holy mantle which is negating a heck of a lot of damage.
3913440	3915440	Yeah again, here we go.
3915440	3920440	See we just shove our wee orbitals in it and Bob's your auntie, Uncle's your fan or something.
3920440	3922440	Shit, I feel bad.
3922440	3923440	Pills!
3923440	3925440	Why we got speed up?
3925440	3927440	Look up.
3927440	3929440	What's that one, hold on, hold on.
3929440	3931440	Oh sorry I've lost my hang.
3931440	3933440	Unidentified Pills.
3933440	3935440	48 hour energy, sure pop it.
3937440	3941440	We don't actually need to do this room so we'll just teleport to the enemy.
3941440	3944440	We've got Sister Viss.
3944440	3946440	Sister Viss.
3946440	3950440	So we're maybe just do orbital knife on these guys?
3950440	3957440	Although I would like to maintain my face.
3957440	3961440	That was so extreme and you know it was extreme.
3961440	3963440	That was insane.
3964440	3966440	Oh.
3968440	3970440	I should maybe just do more.
3970440	3972440	Right one's down.
3975440	3978440	Did I just get to stay in astral form?
3980440	3982440	Why am I so bad?
3982440	3983440	No!
3983440	3985440	Right you're getting nuked.
3986440	3988440	I'm so bad.
3988440	3990440	Oh we get Bookworm.
3991440	3993440	Right, ultimate.
3993440	3995440	Grab this.
3995440	3998440	So we've got Bookworm but I'm keeping this because it's infinite health.
3998440	4001440	And we're going to the El Diablo deal and we're just grabbing it.
4003440	4005440	Thank you El Diablo.
4005440	4007440	We have our Drosidae Vildil.
4009440	4010440	Received that.
4010440	4012440	No, see it doesn't give me infinite health.
4012440	4014440	God how far in the map did we?
4014440	4016440	Whoa this is a big map, isn't it?
4016440	4018440	It's not an XLR4.
4019440	4022440	The purple, red can keep firing you.
4022440	4024440	You want it?
4024440	4029440	You want me, I'll sit here and prove that the red only shoots once.
4029440	4031440	Sorry that was gamer instinct, I just knew.
4031440	4035440	I know it doesn't make sense but I just knew, okay.
4037440	4040440	Oh, that was not the one we wanted but hey ho.
4045440	4047440	Actually, oh we got Lucky Penny.
4047440	4049440	We're at 6 luck.
4049440	4052440	If we could get a trinket that had something like that.
4056440	4058440	I keep dropping more heart.
4060440	4063440	Okay, we're literally full on money.
4063440	4066440	Thank you, a key beggar.
4066440	4068440	Maybe not right now.
4069440	4073440	No, rooms like this I wish we had flying.
4074440	4076440	Holy moly.
4076440	4079440	The bugs are coming.
4080440	4083440	We need to be careful of the bugs.
4083440	4086440	They're gonna steal my little holy mantle.
4086440	4089440	You wouldn't steal my holy mantle, would you?
4089440	4091440	A wild card.
4091440	4093440	Are you squiddin' me right now?
4093440	4094440	Kiff?
4094440	4095440	Charly?
4095440	4097440	I think I said that right.
4097440	4100440	Thank you for the tip, I appreciate it.
4101440	4107440	You're literally reducing the gen 2 goal.
4107440	4109440	Not even kidding.
4109440	4113440	I very much expected a greed fight.
4113440	4115440	I am not at all surprised.
4120440	4122440	Whoa, good block.
4122440	4128440	Good block on the orbital knife.
4128440	4130440	That was a fantastic block.
4130440	4133440	No, stop spitting out spiders, I'm getting annoyed.
4133440	4136440	No, don't give me double spiders please.
4136440	4138440	Okay, the mulligan fly.
4138440	4141440	We need to perish because they always hit me when they're on a poopy.
4141440	4145440	We need to find gen 2 before the donor thun so we can focus on gen 3.
4145440	4147440	You want me to pop out gen 3?
4147440	4149440	We haven't even been a 2 months here yet.
4149440	4151440	We haven't even been a hero.
4152440	4154440	Whoa!
4154440	4156440	Whoa!
4156440	4160440	Okay, my tears are now connected with damage.
4160440	4163440	Oh my god.
4163440	4167440	There's no way, hey, hey, hey.
4167440	4172440	Now there should, there looks like there's going to be a secret room here at the bottom.
4174440	4175440	What?
4175440	4177440	Oh come on mate, cheeky.
4177440	4179440	Okay, there we go, we got both our secrets.
4180440	4182440	Hey, hey, hey, hey.
4182440	4184440	Hey, hey, hey, hey.
4184440	4187440	Give me that bad boy, are you joking me?
4187440	4193440	So we did just take a tier reduction, but the reason why that's so good,
4193440	4196440	as if that didn't push the thing up there,
4196440	4201440	we now can block enemy projectiles by firing.
4201440	4205440	That's right, according to the encyclopedia of,
4205440	4208440	we are what's called MLG proof.
4208440	4211440	Nope.
4211440	4215440	Oh, that didn't get the guy on the bottom.
4215440	4217440	Ooh.
4217440	4219440	Hey, I'm going to pop my ult.
4219440	4221440	I should probably hold it for the next floor.
4221440	4222440	Hold!
4222440	4224440	But it's fine.
4224440	4226440	Yeah, holy crap.
4226440	4229440	I can't believe we're doing a mega scene.
4230440	4232440	I'll take that to the next floor.
4232440	4235440	Unless this card up here is way better.
4235440	4236440	I don't know.
4236440	4238440	Still got zero damage.
4238440	4241440	I knew, I knew, I knew damage.
4241440	4244440	Weird damage, no damage.
4244440	4249440	Okay, we'll grab this heart and then we are good to jump off this floor.
4249440	4251440	Now we have had one greed fight.
4251440	4255440	I believe the next floor is our last chance for a shock.
4255440	4258440	So if we get a greedy greed fight,
4258440	4260440	it's ogre.
4260440	4265440	I don't know if I should use this key burger.
4265440	4268440	I'm going to go for it.
4268440	4270440	Now I might regret it,
4270440	4271440	but I might not.
4271440	4272440	Have you ever thought about that?
4272440	4274440	Okay, I regret it.
4274440	4278440	We'll go down to what?
4278440	4279440	I don't know.
4279440	4281440	Okay.
4281440	4283440	Brave.
4283440	4285440	Brave.
4285440	4288440	Okay, we'll go down to 10 keys.
4288440	4291440	Okay, give me that.
4295440	4298440	10 keys.
4298440	4302440	And here's a gift for you.
4302440	4307440	I enjoyed every second of that.
4307440	4310440	I don't want to go to that chest because I'm too lazy.
4310440	4311440	Look at all that money.
4311440	4313440	I know I'm literally max money.
4313440	4315440	The game is like more.
4315440	4317440	I'm like, no.
4317440	4321440	Low shot speed is always nice.
4321440	4323440	You can still pick up the batteries.
4323440	4325440	Oops, did I forget the batteries?
4325440	4330440	Okay, so this is our last chance for a shock.
4330440	4332440	Is it going to be a greed fight?
4332440	4333440	Odd say yet.
4333440	4335440	Our survey says I.
4335440	4338440	Okay, we can bomb the absolute...
4338440	4340440	Mmm.
4340440	4342440	Okay, our devil deal went up, which is good.
4342440	4344440	Good.
4344440	4346440	Okay, we have this.
4346440	4348440	What are we looking at?
4348440	4350440	What are we looking at?
4350440	4354440	See, Holy Mantle is so OP.
4354440	4356440	I am very happy.
4356440	4358440	No, don't jump.
4358440	4359440	I hate him.
4359440	4362440	He jumps and he's stinky because he lands on your head.
4362440	4364440	Oh, please.
4364440	4365440	Okay, that's better.
4365440	4368440	Okay, I'm just going to pop out so we have all black hearts.
4368440	4370440	So if we do get heart,
4370440	4374440	the game says nephronomic effect smile.
4374440	4378440	All right, I do this.
4378440	4382440	There's no way.
4382440	4385440	Either this one's going to go good or not.
4385440	4387440	Oh, I came to Lake Leech.
4387440	4388440	I'm sorry.
4388440	4391440	I think leech is a cute bit to me, but I think we can do better.
4391440	4394440	All right, we'll grab this.
4394440	4395440	I like leech.
4395440	4396440	I do.
4396440	4399440	Are we going to blue baby?
4399440	4400440	Up or down?
4400440	4403440	I think we may have to go down.
4403440	4405440	No, not unicorn stump.
4405440	4407440	Thanks for the attempt though.
4407440	4408440	No, not anti-gravy.
4408440	4409440	You suck.
4409440	4410440	No, not scatterbombs.
4410440	4411440	You suck.
4411440	4414440	We should have taken leech.
4414440	4418440	It's going to blow up on the next one, I think.
4418440	4421440	Are you...
4421440	4427440	I should have taken the leech, the cute little wiggly boy.
4427440	4431440	Sometimes it's all about taking a wiggly boy, OK?
4431440	4432440	So...
4432440	4434440	Oh, I lost my heart doing that.
4434440	4437440	I thought I was being so smart, being like, ha ha ha.
4437440	4439440	Ugh.
4439440	4442440	Well, it's fine.
4442440	4444440	Sometimes good enough is best.
4444440	4446440	Literally, the game punishes you for thinking,
4446440	4450440	for having the audacity to try and get better.
4450440	4452440	Uh...
4452440	4453440	What?
4453440	4456440	Is there a room, potentially?
4456440	4460440	Uh, I don't have an orbital.
4460440	4463440	OK, the electricity does help with guys like that,
4463440	4465440	where they can only be hurt from one side.
4465440	4467440	I do see the tinted rock.
4467440	4469440	I mean, maybe we'll get a golden chest out of it.
4469440	4472440	I'd rather we actually get golden chests
4472440	4474440	and the chance to spawn an item,
4474440	4477440	or keys, I guess.
4477440	4483440	Uh, than, like, anything else at the moment.
4484440	4488440	But yes, we're going to do cane.
4488440	4492440	And if I have yapped a bit too quickly,
4492440	4499440	then I think we'll give a Zazzle a cheeky run, as well.
4499440	4502440	A Zazzle actually starts with flight.
4502440	4504440	Now, whenever you play this game,
4504440	4506440	you notice that flight is very valuable,
4506440	4508440	not only for mobility,
4508440	4511440	but to get access to items otherwise you wouldn't.
4511440	4513440	For example, we don't have access to that money.
4513440	4516440	Now, we're lucky our economy is so high that we don't nest,
4516440	4518440	so there's a sputter.
4518440	4520440	Get that sputter!
4520440	4522440	We don't actually need it.
4522440	4524440	Is there a tinted rock?
4524440	4528440	I can spot it in here.
4528440	4530440	With your bad eyesight.
4530440	4531440	Oh, gee, son, is that you?
4531440	4534440	I'm teasing, I'm teasing.
4534440	4536440	Ooh!
4537440	4543440	I am so bad at reacting to that.
4543440	4546440	I just was like, yeah, smile.
4546440	4549440	No, we could have had a leech on our side.
4549440	4551440	No.
4551440	4552440	The game's taunting me.
4552440	4554440	I could have had a leech friend.
4558440	4560440	Spitters are quitters.
4560440	4561440	Flight is for cowards.
4561440	4564440	No, it's so OP, though.
4566440	4568440	Okay, what happened?
4568440	4570440	Is there a rock?
4570440	4571440	I can't even see.
4571440	4573440	Oh, there's a gap in the ground.
4573440	4576440	I can't even see what I'm supposed to be aiming for right now.
4576440	4579440	Okay, here's the moment.
4579440	4581440	Oh!
4581440	4583440	As if it just did that.
4583440	4586440	Lol.
4586440	4588440	As if it just did that.
4588440	4590440	See, this is why holy mantles clutch.
4590440	4592440	Last time I was saved by the...
4592440	4595440	Wow, that's...
4595440	4598440	If the shops could be any more disappointing,
4598440	4601440	I don't even think this is possible.
4601440	4604440	Now, normally I'd be like, yay, vault,
4604440	4607440	but I actually don't think we want to.
4607440	4609440	I don't, it's not...
4609440	4614440	We have such low damage to recharge.
4614440	4616440	It's like damage per 4 increases,
4616440	4619440	like, nah, we're literally going to take ourselves away
4619440	4621440	from even having the...
4621440	4624440	Did that really get me?
4624440	4625440	See these wee hings?
4625440	4630440	I've got nothing but the audacity to tell you that much.
4630440	4635440	Is there really no sacrifice floor?
4635440	4637440	And I've popped the book.
4637440	4638440	I better have popped the book.
4638440	4640440	Oh!
4640440	4642440	I need my glegs on.
4642440	4644440	I'm saying, oh, you've not got your glegs on.
4644440	4645440	I've not got my glegs on.
4645440	4646440	Honestly.
4646440	4648440	As you get for questioning my loyalty,
4648440	4650440	we got tricked with the backstab.
4650440	4652440	Honestly.
4652440	4654440	Not one sacrifice floor.
4654440	4657440	I'm so sorry to backtrack,
4657440	4663440	but the value of having a sacrifice room
4663440	4665440	is like pretty high because we have old bandage,
4665440	4668440	but we got it once and then the game was like,
4668440	4670440	nope, that was your one chance to shine.
4670440	4671440	Never again.
4671440	4674440	I'm like, okay.
4674440	4676440	Of course you get me.
4676440	4679440	Like, you're not even near me.
4679440	4680440	Right.
4680440	4682440	We'll see you perish.
4682440	4684440	I did all that backtracking for a chest.
4684440	4686440	Enter an unclear boss.
4686440	4689440	Fully recharges the activity.
4689440	4691440	Wow.
4691440	4693440	That was rubbish.
4693440	4695440	Once again, I'd like to thank Holy Mantle
4695440	4697440	for carrying us exactly.
4697440	4701440	Without you, I could bomb that thing back there.
4701440	4703440	I'll try.
4703440	4704440	Literally carried by the wafer,
4704440	4705440	carried by Holy Mantle,
4705440	4709440	and now getting again with the three and not a card.
4709440	4711440	Rubbish.
4714440	4716440	You can take it.
4716440	4717440	What, the trinket?
4717440	4719440	Oh, you're right.
4719440	4720440	This is the last floor.
4720440	4724440	I could have done anything with this current trinket,
4724440	4725440	which is pay to win.
4725440	4727440	Sorry for the backtracking.
4728440	4733440	Yes.
4733440	4737440	Mercy has a full video coming out on her channel soon.
4737440	4740440	For you who use Holy Harvester,
4740440	4742440	we're so shocked she played it.
4742440	4744440	Yes, she's getting a highlight reel of it
4744440	4746440	because she just loved it so much.
4746440	4750440	But management's going to tweet out
4750440	4755440	that we need editors for Shorts
4755440	4759440	and for, oh, why did that glitch out?
4759440	4762440	I have the mod that lets you see her foot coming down,
4762440	4764440	but I think it's bugging out right now.
4764440	4766440	I don't know what blue mum means.
4766440	4767440	I don't know if it means she's more aggressive.
4767440	4769440	Oh, I've lost already.
4769440	4773440	Hold on, hold on, hold on.
4773440	4775440	Oh, no.
4775440	4776440	This can't be.
4776440	4777440	I'm going to lose.
4777440	4779440	We are solo energy.
4779440	4782440	Sorry, we're having to take the negative
4782440	4785440	because this is insane.
4785440	4788440	This is absolutely terrible.
4788440	4791440	No stat upgrades, actually.
4791440	4794440	If anything, stat down because lost contact,
4794440	4798440	but her stat's down.
4798440	4801440	I don't want to sacrifice too much of my health for this
4801440	4803440	because the next few floors,
4803440	4806440	they do have cheeky enemies that take out your health quick
4806440	4810440	and I really don't want to go low.
4810440	4817440	But yeah, this is cheekily not the best.
4817440	4820440	We could definitely be doing better with just about everything.
4820440	4825440	Leave my dead body alone.
4825440	4832440	Yeah, this is a unique situation to be in.
4832440	4838440	Oh god, we've got flight now.
4838440	4841440	Okay, I can deal with flight.
4841440	4843440	But yeah, that's how lower damage is.
4843440	4847440	Just nothing is happening to Mohen.
4847440	4850440	Oh, well, I'm going to pop my ult.
4850440	4852440	Maybe the net cross is what's going to take her out.
4852440	4854440	The net cross effect.
4854440	4856440	I think it's 60 damage by default.
4856440	4861440	If you get page two, I think it increases to like 60.
4861440	4865440	I meant to say 30 if I said 60.
4865440	4869440	This is not going to go well.
4869440	4872440	I'm trying.
4872440	4873440	Come on, game.
4873440	4875440	You must realize my health is low.
4875440	4880440	You must know how terribly low my health is.
4880440	4882440	This is excruciating.
4882440	4885440	This is a crawl.
4885440	4887440	I don't know if I need a bomber.
4887440	4889440	You know that?
4889440	4892440	Okay.
4892440	4893440	Pardon me.
4893440	4894440	I'm sorry.
4894440	4897440	We did fail the devil deal, which is a shame.
4897440	4901440	We are going to have to take the damage, the negative.
4901440	4904440	So we're going to have to drop down below Satan.
4904440	4906440	Satan.
4906440	4907440	Bless you.
4907440	4908440	There's a cough.
4908440	4909440	Actually, hydration check.
4909440	4918440	I think I'm about to start coughing.
4918440	4920440	I love my boomer gamer veto words.
4920440	4922440	I'm not fucking boomer.
4922440	4923440	I'm not even.
4923440	4926440	I'm not even millennial.
4926440	4927440	Boomer.
4927440	4932440	I'll shove a boomer up your arse.
4932440	4933440	Okay.
4933440	4936440	We don't have anything else we can do on this floor.
4936440	4942440	We're going to take the Satanic Bible with us.
4942440	4945440	T-boy is pretty old mummy.
4945440	4948440	What the sigma?
4948440	4951440	Let's hope we can get a devil deal as well as a devil item on this floor.
4951440	4958440	Because that would make the world a difference if we got some of that good stuff.
4958440	4961440	I'm wondering if brimstone shot.
4961440	4964440	Oh, you're done.
4964440	4970440	Brimstone shot would still have the negation.
4970440	4972440	Like they can't hit us.
4972440	4976440	What's the fight room?
4976440	4978440	Tell you what.
4978440	4980440	Tell you what.
4980440	4982440	Let's just do that.
4982440	4985440	Zoomer, but somehow also not a weeb.
4985440	4987440	Well, we're watching anime together.
4987440	4990440	She better get recommended me the ones I need to see.
4990440	4994440	I've seen the ones that everyone's seen.
4994440	4999440	Like attack on titan, death note, kill or kill.
4999440	5001440	I've seen what needs to be seen.
5001440	5005440	So you guys can actually start recommending me animes.
5005440	5007440	And we'll do full binge anime days.
5007440	5009440	I think runescape.
5009440	5016440	We might do a binge because I got two more streams and then I've got my 99 on runescape.
5016440	5020440	So that's another goal met that I wanted.
5020440	5025440	And then we'll do weeb days.
5025440	5030440	And then I'll call it the weebification of strawnae.
5030440	5036440	I'm going to pop this just to make sure I've popped it.
5036440	5039440	That's a lot of enemies.
5039440	5043440	I'm trying to get the one in the corner so I can run somewhere if I need to.
5043440	5046440	But it's not really happening.
5046440	5048440	The enemies are so polite.
5048440	5049440	They just don't walk into me.
5049440	5051440	My favourite kind of enemy.
5051440	5055440	I'm watching dundum iron-blooded orphans.
5055440	5056440	It's pretty gay.
5056440	5059440	Cowboy beatbox.
5059440	5064440	I've seen samurai shampoo.
5064440	5066440	Is that really not a hit?
5066440	5067440	Oh!
5067440	5069440	Why did I not see the dam?
5069440	5073440	I did not see it coming at all.
5073440	5076440	It must be the confidence that you give me reeflings, honestly.
5076440	5078440	That's right, I'm turning this on you.
5078440	5079440	It's your problem.
5079440	5080440	It's your problem.
5080440	5081440	It's my problem.
5081440	5083440	Please item!
5083440	5086440	Receive triple shot.
5086440	5087440	Triple shot?
5087440	5089440	I mean, I guess.
5089440	5092440	We can use it if we're in a pinch.
5092440	5100440	See, flight for a room like this would be so helpful to avoiding attacks.
5100440	5102440	No confidence.
5102440	5107440	You give me all confidence.
5107440	5110440	Oh!
5110440	5113440	Okay, we can at least go in the curse room to check it out.
5113440	5114440	Let me get up.
5114440	5116440	Let him get up.
5116440	5117440	Oh, one more.
5117440	5120440	One more.
5120440	5124440	Some of these enemies do not want to be vanquished.
5124440	5127440	I'm so used to them coming flying at you.
5127440	5128440	Okay, we can pop this.
5128440	5130440	Maybe a guppy item?
5130440	5131440	Speed?
5131440	5132440	Sure.
5132440	5137440	Oh, guppers!
5137440	5141440	No.
5141440	5144440	The game really wants me to take it.
5144440	5145440	Oh my gosh.
5145440	5148440	Wait, you can get a library?
5148440	5149440	What?
5149440	5153440	I didn't know you could get a library in the room.
5153440	5154440	What?
5154440	5158440	Well, we've already got that.
5158440	5160440	I'll go at ten keys and no more.
5160440	5164440	I didn't know you could get a library down here.
5164440	5165440	Oh.
5165440	5166440	I'll take that.
5166440	5167440	I don't mind if I do.
5167440	5168440	A devil beggar.
5168440	5169440	Sure.
5169440	5170440	Boom.
5170440	5174440	Well, you can actually do something with the money.
5175440	5181440	I had no idea you could get it down here.
5181440	5183440	Do I have access to a shop?
5183440	5184440	Sure.
5184440	5185440	I'll take it.
5185440	5186440	Thanks.
5186440	5187440	Did you get 20-20?
5187440	5190440	Yeah, I got 20-20 bookworm.
5190440	5192440	Hey, hit him with it.
5192440	5194440	Hey, hit him with it.
5194440	5195440	Gobi.
5195440	5196440	Gobi.
5196440	5197440	I love it.
5197440	5199440	I love the jump animation.
5199440	5201440	It's so cute.
5201440	5203440	No, go away.
5203440	5204440	No, go away.
5204440	5205440	You stink.
5205440	5206440	Ow.
5206440	5207440	Okay.
5207440	5210440	Did I use the book on this floor?
5210440	5212440	I have now.
5212440	5215440	I've used it twice if I forgot the other time.
5215440	5219440	I don't like these guys.
5219440	5224440	I wish we got more pills dropped actually.
5224440	5229440	Now that I think about it, six luck but not getting pills dropped.
5229440	5230440	Hmm.
5230440	5231440	Curious game.
5231440	5233440	The game knew I picked Kane.
5233440	5234440	Hmm.
5234440	5235440	And I had Lucky Foot.
5235440	5236440	Hmm.
5236440	5237440	This game wants me to suffer.
5237440	5238440	Admit it.
5238440	5240440	You want me to be upset.
5240440	5243440	You want me to vanquish and cry.
5243440	5249440	So not only do we have contact lines, we actually have PapaFly which protects us from incoming
5249440	5250440	projectiles.
5250440	5256440	I get, yeah, literally I can just spray them down.
5256440	5257440	Feels good, man.
5257440	5259440	Okay, hold on.
5259440	5260440	Alright.
5260440	5262440	Doesn't mean I'm immune though.
5262440	5265440	Can I blow this up?
5265440	5266440	Yeah.
5266440	5267440	Sure.
5267440	5270440	I'm sure that would come in handy.
5270440	5271440	So what's down here then?
5271440	5272440	Just a random room.
5272440	5273440	Whoa.
5273440	5276440	Just a room to punish you if you got a bit curious.
5276440	5277440	That's all.
5277440	5280440	Oh, we got Back Saber.
5280440	5282440	Back Saber, proct.
5282440	5283440	That's right.
5283440	5288440	The word is proct for you noobs that have never played this game before.
5288440	5291440	It means the effect came into play.
5291440	5293440	It's okay if you're a noob though.
5293440	5296440	I'll look after you.
5296440	5298440	What the heck?
5298440	5301440	I rarely go against this boss.
5301440	5303440	Wow.
5303440	5308440	I rarely go against this boss.
5308440	5320440	They get...
5320440	5321440	Hold on.
5321440	5324440	I need to pop this.
5324440	5327440	I never go against this boss.
5327440	5328440	I hardly...
5328440	5329440	What?
5329440	5332440	It has a phase freaking worm too?
5332440	5337440	And of course it's not projectile base because that would be too easy.
5337440	5338440	Right.
5338440	5339440	Damage up.
5339440	5341440	Thank goodness.
5341440	5342440	Are you kidding me?
5342440	5344440	We got a Krampus fight.
5344440	5349440	Our damage is now seven so we're actually looking decent.
5349440	5350440	A Krampus fight.
5350440	5354440	At least give us Lump of Coal instead of his head.
5354440	5356440	At least...
5356440	5361440	I didn't realize he could spin in a wee circle like that.
5361440	5364440	I said Lump of Coal.
5364440	5366440	I can't believe that.
5366440	5370440	I wouldn't have gone any worse if I tried.
5370440	5372440	Lump of Coal.
5372440	5375440	And we got head.
5375440	5380440	Look, head's good for you but for me not really.
5380440	5382440	That's terrible.
5382440	5383440	That's awful.
5383440	5386440	The way it just rolls off my tongue as well.
5386440	5388440	That's terrible.
5388440	5391440	Oh, of course there's pinworms as well.
5391440	5395440	How could we forget?
5395440	5398440	Okay.
5398440	5400440	I have no idea.
5400440	5402440	Oh, then we've got an arcade.
5402440	5405440	Okay, we can utilize our monies.
5405440	5407440	Arcades don't need keys.
5407440	5409440	They need a single cent.
5409440	5414440	Hmm.
5414440	5418440	The arcade machine took a full health.
5418440	5420440	Not a wee one.
5420440	5423440	I was going to say we can maybe get IV back.
5423440	5428440	But if it's taken full, I don't think so.
5428440	5430440	Oh, please.
5430440	5432440	I think I can just mow them down.
5432440	5434440	I don't need to aim if it's a projectile.
5434440	5439440	That's a mimic chest but because we have Holy Manta we can grab it.
5439440	5443440	Yeah, this is a womb floor.
5443440	5446440	Ooh.
5446440	5449440	The classic womb room.
5449440	5450440	Give me that.
5450440	5451440	Right, popped all.
5451440	5453440	So we're 100% getting a devil deal.
5453440	5455440	Whoa, we beelined.
5455440	5457440	Oh, I hate this guy.
5457440	5458440	I hate this guy.
5458440	5459440	Please.
5459440	5460440	Please be nice.
5460440	5461440	Please.
5461440	5462440	Okay.
5462440	5467440	The enemy, the secret room can't be in that previous room.
5467440	5469440	Maybe here?
5469440	5470440	Yeah, okay.
5470440	5472440	That's the best we can do.
5472440	5476440	Increase our chances by popping his cloaks.
5476440	5477440	36%.
5477440	5478440	It's not the best.
5478440	5479440	He's alright.
5479440	5482440	But yeah, that's pretty much all we can do.
5482440	5487440	Women downwards always is full heart damage, dang.
5487440	5490440	What am I meant to do beneath our desk now?
5490440	5492440	You can lick my toes.
5492440	5494440	That's terrible.
5494440	5497440	That made no sense if no one was reading chat.
5497440	5499440	I apologize if that came out of nowhere.
5499440	5503440	It's because I didn't read the full message.
5503440	5504440	Okay.
5504440	5506440	Okay, come on.
5507440	5511440	Okay, we're going to commit and we're just going to spray down the center.
5511440	5519440	Because I think we'll, okay, unless she does that, unless she does that attack, then I'm
5519440	5522440	not sure we can out-shoot this.
5522440	5524440	Just take your time.
5524440	5526440	We can out-shoot that.
5526440	5527440	That's fine.
5527440	5529440	We have orbitals as well, which are also protecting us.
5529440	5531440	We have gone full defense this run.
5531440	5535440	Actually, now that I think about it, this is just full defense.
5535440	5545440	I need to remember to go down after this fight.
5545440	5547440	Can you reach over there?
5547440	5549440	Seriously.
5549440	5553440	I must remember to go down.
5553440	5554440	Come on.
5554440	5556440	Please don't start laser beaming.
5556440	5559440	That's when I can't keep up.
5559440	5562440	That's the very move I was actually talking about.
5562440	5564440	Funny you mentioned that.
5564440	5566440	That's actually the very one.
5566440	5571440	Okay, we failed the devil deal, which is a shame.
5571440	5574440	Let's just go down then, I guess.
5574440	5576440	Just cast Feet of the Lea.
5576440	5577440	There's plenty of things to look down there.
5577440	5579440	How much longer are you going to play for?
5579440	5581440	More meh.
5581440	5582440	Oh, wow.
5582440	5584440	This run's actually taken a lot longer.
5584440	5587440	I think we're only doing one run today and then I'm going to redirect into Sheepster.
5587440	5590440	Oh, there's an eyeball.
5590440	5592440	Okay, we're fine.
5592440	5596440	I don't know if Sheepster's is up yet.
5596440	5600440	Okay, we've got bombs.
5600440	5602440	I'll probably just read a few marshmallows after this.
5602440	5606440	I didn't realize how much of a yamper I am.
5606440	5608440	I do apologize again for anyone who...
5608440	5609440	Oh, I don't have flight.
5609440	5611440	For some reason I thought I had flight because he had flight.
5611440	5613440	Although that's not how the game works.
5613440	5618440	I would love it if I did that.
5618440	5621440	Pop and all to confirm that we're getting a devil deal item.
5621440	5624440	Sheepy has a collab so she seems later today.
5624440	5626440	Sheepy, are you dodging me?
5626440	5627440	I'm starting to think you're dodging me.
5627440	5628440	Smile.
5630440	5633440	Yes, for anyone that is listening in,
5633440	5635440	I will repeat myself in a few days' time,
5635440	5637440	so don't worry if you didn't hear it at first.
5637440	5638440	There's got...
5638440	5640440	Wait, is the enemy still in this room?
5640440	5642440	Oh my God, I thought that.
5642440	5644440	I was like, wait, are you still here?
5644440	5646440	Hello, is anyone here?
5646440	5649440	I can't do any membership streams
5649440	5652440	or ASMR streams for three weeks.
5652440	5656440	But I will always make it up to you
5656440	5658440	because you know what I'm like.
5658440	5661440	So all I can say is thank you for your patience
5661440	5663440	and waiting on me.
5665440	5666440	You're joking.
5669440	5671440	Fricking...
5673440	5675440	But my gen mates, you can find their links
5675440	5677440	in the description below.
5677440	5679440	They will be doing ASMRs,
5679440	5682440	though Mersi had a fantastic ASMR role play
5682440	5685440	if you want to check out the VOD where she went to.
5687440	5688440	That was really good.
5688440	5690440	I found it really good anyway.
5692440	5695440	Considering she knew to the ASMR side of things
5695440	5697440	and producing it side of things.
5699440	5702440	I mean, we can try and find the secret room,
5702440	5704440	but yeah.
5704440	5706440	I think we'll just go for it.
5708440	5710440	I'm going to pop the hanged man.
5710440	5712440	I'll see if I regret it, but...
5714440	5716440	Oh, and Holy Mantle's gone already.
5716440	5717440	Lovely.
5717440	5719440	I might just pop the thing so I have the Necro effect.
5721440	5723440	Please don't spin. I'll cry.
5725440	5727440	It's not too bad.
5727440	5728440	It's not too bad.
5728440	5730440	It could be worse.
5730440	5732440	It could be a heck of a lot worse.
5733440	5737440	I really hope we get a good item
5737440	5739440	in the treasure box.
5739440	5741440	Is it the dark room it's called?
5741440	5744440	Oh wow, the card didn't last.
5747440	5750440	Okay, we can just keep spraying
5750440	5753440	because we have the dodge on the things.
5753440	5756440	As just as he's going to keep spraying.
5756440	5757440	Do you mind?
5757440	5760440	Papa Fly is going so ham right now.
5761440	5764440	Well, that's what we didn't want, but that's what we got.
5764440	5766440	Okay, we got that. That's fine.
5775440	5777440	Oh, I just got hurt by something.
5777440	5779440	Something's... I have no idea.
5779440	5782440	I don't have a concept of what's happening.
5784440	5785440	Okay, lovely.
5785440	5786440	Please don't...
5786440	5788440	I swear if I die because I'm just trash,
5788440	5790440	I'm going to cry so much.
5791440	5793440	I literally have Holy Mantle.
5793440	5795440	Imagine dying with Holy Mantle.
5795440	5797440	I'm not even playing the loss.
5797440	5799440	Okay, don't do that again to me.
5799440	5802440	I suck and there's no charge things back there,
5802440	5803440	so I'm just going to...
5803440	5805440	Mercy went all out in the stream.
5805440	5807440	It was good. It was really good.
5807440	5809440	Honestly, you're scary when you say that you will make up
5809440	5810440	for it last time.
5810440	5811440	You did four streams back to back.
5811440	5812440	What will happen?
5812440	5813440	Please take care.
5813440	5814440	Oh, you already know what's going to happen.
5814440	5816440	It's going to be like multiple membership streams,
5816440	5818440	multiple public streams on the same day.
5819440	5821440	Or endurance streams back to back.
5822440	5824440	Nope, don't need money.
5825440	5828440	Taking damage spawns a permanent demon.
5828440	5831440	Oh, of course I don't get to see my health either
5831440	5832440	because that would be too nice.
5832440	5834440	I'm going to take flies.
5834440	5835440	I like flies.
5835440	5837440	I'm just going to grab these. Why not?
5838440	5840440	We have Holy Mantle.
5840440	5842440	So we can what? Come in and out.
5843440	5844440	Holy moly.
5844440	5845440	I love Holy Mantle.
5845440	5847440	Enter in a room poisons all enemies.
5847440	5849440	Yes, that's a good one.
5851440	5852440	We got egg as well.
5852440	5856440	So we get soul heart and we can negate 20% damage.
5856440	5859440	That was a really good room to get all things considered.
5859440	5861440	I hate these guys.
5862440	5863440	They're terrible.
5866440	5867440	He's super scary.
5867440	5868440	He just got me.
5869440	5870440	Sorry, hold on.
5870440	5872440	My fingers falling off the analog stick.
5873440	5874440	He's so scary.
5874440	5875440	I hate him.
5876440	5877440	The wee mask guy.
5877440	5878440	Come on, blue baby.
5878440	5880440	Beat him up with your wee flies.
5880440	5881440	Oh no, you're not blue baby.
5881440	5882440	Sorry, zombie baby.
5882440	5883440	Dead baby.
5883440	5884440	Rotten baby.
5884440	5885440	Rotten baby.
5885440	5886440	I forgot his name.
5886440	5887440	An egg.
5887440	5888440	It's literally an egg.
5888440	5889440	Look at my head.
5889440	5890440	I'm an egg now.
5890440	5891440	I literally have an egg head.
5891440	5892440	Who you calling an egg head?
5893440	5894440	Look at my head.
5894440	5895440	It's an egg.
5897440	5898440	Secret floor.
5898440	5899440	Secret room, sorry.
5899440	5901440	And it's not a pill room.
5901440	5904440	I can't believe I'm actually asking the game to give me a pill room.
5905440	5906440	That's when you know it's bad.
5908440	5909440	Relax.
5910440	5911440	Okay.
5911440	5912440	Well, I deserve that.
5913440	5914440	Are you?
5914440	5917440	I'm actually going to die at the end of this game.
5919440	5920440	Please.
5923440	5924440	Please.
5925440	5926440	Okay, that was lucky.
5926440	5927440	What do you?
5927440	5930440	Oh no, he has the brimstone aim.
5930440	5932440	He has brimstone aim.
5933440	5935440	Like all lock things, my Bobber.
5936440	5937440	And he's going to do it.
5937440	5938440	I don't know when he's going to do it.
5938440	5940440	Okay, he's giving me spiders.
5940440	5941440	Yeah, he just did it there.
5941440	5943440	Did you see that purple charge beam?
5943440	5946440	I was on a you, you, you mop bag, honestly.
5946440	5947440	I saw that coming.
5948440	5950440	If we could raise our base damage,
5950440	5952440	we could raise our base damage.
5952440	5954440	We could raise our base damage.
5954440	5956440	We could raise our base damage.
5958440	5960440	We do have 6% luck.
5960440	5963440	Honestly, we should probably be getting a bit.
5963440	5964440	Did I?
5964440	5965440	I just.
5967440	5968440	Hold on a minute.
5973440	5974440	Wow.
5976440	5978440	Who are you calling a pin today?
5979440	5983440	What did, did you guys know that match is the secret voice actor of Patrick star?
5983440	5985440	Who are you calling a pin?
5986440	5987440	Right.
5987440	5990440	I'm going to pop my alt because I've no got a scooby-doo what my health is,
5990440	5992440	but he needs when he needs.
5992440	5993440	Right.
5993440	5997440	The fear is actually helping to take enemies off of her bat.
5997440	5999440	Oh, this is a terrible room.
6000440	6001440	No.
6003440	6006440	No, that's what I didn't want.
6006440	6008440	How am I supposed to negate that?
6008440	6009440	I don't know.
6010440	6012440	He's curving.
6012440	6014440	He's not straight.
6014440	6015440	He's curving.
6015440	6017440	Why is it curved?
6019440	6020440	You got me.
6020440	6021440	Okay.
6021440	6022440	Hold on.
6022440	6023440	I'm just walloping them.
6023440	6024440	Okay.
6026440	6029440	I don't know if this boss fight is going to go well.
6029440	6032440	I'm going to keep all my bombs for the boss fight because I don't trust this.
6034440	6035440	He's by the pope.
6036440	6038440	Donating cause I'm sad.
6038440	6039440	I can't watch.
6039440	6040440	Just listen.
6040440	6042440	You'd only hear me right now.
6042440	6044440	Are you at work?
6044440	6046440	Don't make me start.
6046440	6048440	Thank you, Broly legend for the tip.
6048440	6050440	Patrick is a neat and still makes ends meet every month.
6050440	6053440	Wait, you keep people actually say ain't got a scooby-doo.
6053440	6054440	That wasn't a sigh up.
6054440	6055440	No, we say that.
6055440	6056440	I've not got a clue.
6056440	6060440	I ain't got a scooby-doo because scooby-doo are always looking for a clue.
6061440	6062440	I've not got a scooby-doo.
6062440	6063440	What's going on?
6063440	6064440	I've not got a clue.
6065440	6066440	It's not a sigh up.
6066440	6067440	It's real.
6067440	6069440	I promise you British people are real.
6069440	6071440	I'm sorry you had to learn this way.
6074440	6075440	That's a good something.
6080440	6081440	Oh no.
6083440	6085440	I may have just killed us.
6087440	6089440	I may have just killed us.
6090440	6092440	I may have just killed us run dead in the water.
6094440	6095440	Oh yeah, piggy bank.
6095440	6096440	That'll sure help.
6096440	6097440	Yeah, thanks piggy bank.
6097440	6098440	Yeah, thanks.
6103440	6108440	I accidentally picked up a quarter which has no value at all in this run.
6108440	6112440	When I desperately need health and I keep messing up.
6114440	6117440	If I could just mow him down before he mows me down.
6121440	6122440	I can't tell if that...
6122440	6128440	So sometimes the game puts down bombs to give you a hint that the secret room's there.
6128440	6131440	But obviously you can't, you always believe it.
6131440	6134440	Okay, that was lucky that Toxic Shot came in clutch.
6135440	6140440	So again, we're going to try and mow him down and make him scared because his attack is insane.
6140440	6141440	I do not like his attack.
6143440	6145440	Okay, that was lucky.
6146440	6147440	This is not lucky.
6148440	6150440	That's not lucky at all.
6152440	6154440	I really would like...
6156440	6159440	I would really like a chance to survive, please.
6159440	6160440	I really don't want to lose right at the end.
6160440	6162440	I'm going to be so sad.
6162440	6163440	There was a guy there.
6163440	6164440	I didn't realize he was there.
6167440	6173440	Toxic Shock is definitely helping do some damage, which I'm glad because we don't have a lot.
6175440	6179440	Damage and taking damage, taking damage shoots away to assure.
6180440	6181440	See, I...
6182440	6183440	That was four.
6184440	6188440	I'm kind of stranded because my car broke down and my phone's almost there.
6188440	6189440	That's like...
6191440	6192440	Are you called...
6193440	6194440	Are you called a mechanic or whatever?
6194440	6195440	Nah, I believe you.
6195440	6196440	You can win this easily.
6196440	6197440	Wait, they're real.
6197440	6198440	I thought it was just a joke.
6198440	6202440	You only lost one red heart, but I don't have any red hearts now.
6203440	6204440	Are you scared?
6204440	6207440	It means I have very low soul hearts.
6208440	6212440	Because we had four red hearts, so we're now missing four hearts.
6212440	6214440	And I'm taking damage in every room.
6215440	6216440	Like a dum-dum.
6220440	6221440	Okay.
6226440	6228440	Were we just saved?
6229440	6230440	Oh.
6232440	6235440	Turns all troll bombs into safety ones.
6235440	6237440	Well, I'd rather take the safety ones.
6237440	6240440	Did we just get saved by Cricket's Head?
6240440	6242440	I think we did.
6245440	6247440	I think we just got saved by Cricket's Head.
6247440	6248440	I'm not even kidding.
6248440	6249440	I'm gonna pop this instantly.
6252440	6253440	Okay.
6254440	6256440	I think we just got saved by Cricket's Head.
6256440	6258440	Holy moly.
6258440	6261440	I'm gonna just spam my wee bombs.
6262440	6265440	Now the purple might wrap around.
6265440	6268440	Okay, we're gonna spam the bombs.
6269440	6270440	Whoa.
6270440	6272440	Okay, see, that's what I didn't like.
6274440	6276440	I'm just gonna spam bombs.
6277440	6280440	There's nothing wrong with the bur-bur-bur spamming.
6280440	6281440	None wrong with spamming the bombs.
6281440	6282440	Okay, we actually did it.
6283440	6284440	Sure.
6284440	6285440	Let's do a victory lap.
6287440	6289440	The lamb can't kill you with shielded tears, mommy.
6289440	6291440	I don't believe in myself.
6291440	6293440	Okay, seller one.
6293440	6297440	Right, we are just gonna do one run.
6297440	6299440	Oh my god, we're so strong.
6300440	6302440	Okay, now we can be picky and choosy.
6302440	6304440	Continuum, absolutely.
6304440	6305440	I love continuum.
6305440	6306440	Very good.
6306440	6308440	We now actually have range.
6308440	6309440	Let's go.
6310440	6311440	Adult and adult?
6311440	6312440	No.
6312440	6313440	I don't wanna take these.
6314440	6315440	Yucky.
6315440	6316440	Stinky.
6316440	6320440	Right, so we're doing what's called a victory lap,
6320440	6322440	which means you basically get to go again
6322440	6324440	and keep all your items,
6324440	6327440	which is pretty cool.
6327440	6328440	So we might get a chance to get-
6328440	6329440	Oh, we got BFF.
6329440	6330440	I forgot about that.
6330440	6332440	Okay, we're gonna go to the room.
6334440	6335440	And we're gonna grab this.
6335440	6337440	Spectral tears and flight.
6337440	6338440	Yep, we're gonna grab it.
6339440	6342440	So this is where things get super OP
6342440	6345440	and things get super duper easy.
6346440	6349440	Which is exactly why I like this.
6349440	6350440	I'm gonna take BFF.
6351440	6352440	We'll take Buddy in a box.
6352440	6353440	Why not?
6353440	6355440	We'll try and get the conjoined transformation.
6356440	6358440	If you get Mum's pills, why not?
6361440	6362440	Range up.
6363440	6364440	Health up.
6366440	6367440	Balls of steel,
6367440	6370440	which gives you two soul hearts and power pill.
6371440	6374440	But yeah, this is the cool part about Isaac.
6375440	6377440	It means more time with moment, yeah.
6377440	6378440	We're gonna do this.
6378440	6381440	Now, normally you could just obliterate through it.
6381440	6382440	Sadly.
6386440	6387440	Wait, what's going on?
6391440	6392440	Oh, whoops.
6392440	6394440	He wasn't taking-
6394440	6397440	He wasn't taking the health I thought he was taking.
6397440	6399440	You didn't see that, okay?
6399440	6400440	You didn't see that.
6402440	6403440	You didn't see that.
6403440	6404440	That was rather embarrassing.
6404440	6406440	I wasn't paying attention, okay?
6406440	6407440	I wasn't paying attention.
6408440	6410440	We could grab the heart in here.
6411440	6412440	Fill damage, yeah.
6415440	6416440	Whoopsies.
6416440	6417440	I wasn't paying attention.
6417440	6419440	Thank goodness we're OP.
6421440	6422440	Oh, health up.
6423440	6424440	Oh well.
6424440	6426440	Maybe we can get a-
6427440	6429440	Oh, look at that continuum already.
6429440	6431440	Looking spectacular.
6433440	6435440	Don't mind the fuzz, please.
6435440	6436440	Can I get an item?
6438440	6439440	Come on.
6440440	6442440	Give it to me, Rachel.
6442440	6443440	Show it to me, please.
6445440	6448440	Yeah, this is why I adore-
6451440	6452440	What was it?
6452440	6453440	Radiation?
6453440	6454440	Toxic shock?
6454440	6455440	It's just so good.
6455440	6456440	Come on, give us-
6456440	6457440	No.
6457440	6458440	Flight for the room.
6458440	6459440	We've already got flight.
6459440	6460440	Mommy's throwing!
6460440	6461440	No, I'm too OP.
6461440	6463440	I need to level the plane field, okay?
6464440	6465440	But yeah, look at that.
6465440	6466440	Oh, so satisfying.
6467440	6469440	Did you know that if you don't attack,
6469440	6471440	we fly then it'll buzz away
6471440	6473440	and you'll get an item on lock?
6473440	6475440	Leviathan, speed and damage.
6475440	6477440	Like, this is what we're talking about.
6477440	6479440	14.37.
6480440	6481440	Damage.
6482440	6483440	We'll go next.
6487440	6489440	I like Super Meat Boy when he's fully transformed.
6489440	6490440	It's so good.
6490440	6491440	Do your best, mommy.
6491440	6492440	I will!
6493440	6496440	And we're gonna do so MLG in this game.
6497440	6498440	Okay.
6498440	6499440	Again, a room with nothing.
6499440	6500440	Oh wait, we can go in here.
6501440	6502440	Okay, let's see.
6502440	6503440	Can we get so hard?
6504440	6505440	Stompy.
6505440	6506440	So hard.
6506440	6507440	Balls of steel.
6508440	6510440	And we've got El Diablo.
6511440	6513440	Oh, it's so satisfying
6513440	6515440	when you do a frickin' victory lap.
6515440	6516440	I'm so sorry.
6516440	6518440	If you're ever bored of Isaac,
6518440	6519440	do a victory lap.
6519440	6521440	It's just like, oh, that's right.
6521440	6522440	I'm mowing you all down
6522440	6524440	and there's nothing you can do about it.
6524440	6525440	Take it.
6528440	6530440	Whoa, we got C-section?
6530440	6531440	Hold on.
6535440	6539440	Oh my gosh, the babies are cute.
6540440	6542440	Look at the electricity coming from them.
6542440	6545440	C-section is like an insane amount of damage.
6546440	6548440	And they have homing.
6550440	6551440	That's right.
6551440	6553440	The babies will home to you.
6554440	6556440	Nah, you just need a tears up.
6556440	6558440	Birth rate?
6558440	6560440	All future floors will contain
6560440	6562440	an upgraded arcade room.
6566440	6567440	What?
6568440	6569440	That's so cool.
6571440	6572440	What's that?
6572440	6573440	Full health.
6573440	6574440	Full health.
6576440	6578440	I'm not going to spend my money
6578440	6580440	because I've been spending another shot.
6581440	6584440	Oh, toxic shot just took over there.
6585440	6587440	Right, that was a shot, wasn't it?
6587440	6589440	Unfortunately, we do have...
6589440	6590440	Oh, that's a sticky penny.
6590440	6592440	You can't pick it up.
6592440	6596440	Unfortunately, we do have the curse...
6596440	6597440	What curse is it?
6597440	6599440	The no mapping curse.
6599440	6600440	But I think I know where I'm going.
6600440	6602440	I think I trust myself.
6602440	6603440	Let me grab this.
6604440	6605440	But look.
6605440	6607440	Looky, looky.
6607440	6609440	All done.
6609440	6611440	Sure, we've got conjoined.
6612440	6613440	Yay!
6615440	6618440	Shoot normal tier 7 pair of damage.
6619440	6621440	I mean...
6621440	6623440	Did we just take him?
6623440	6625440	I feel like we replenish our health so quickly.
6625440	6627440	There's no point in like skipping.
6629440	6631440	I feel like I'm feeling it.
6632440	6633440	Okay.
6633440	6635440	C-Section and Shield of Tears is dumb
6635440	6637440	because they keep firing homing Shield of Tears.
6637440	6640440	Never seen that item after 200 hours of this game.
6640440	6641440	What one?
6641440	6644440	Oh, your profile picture is my eyeball.
6644440	6646440	I recognize my own eyeball anywhere.
6646440	6648440	Don't forget to use your item.
6649440	6650440	Yes.
6650440	6652440	I popped that mouth like bang.
6653440	6655440	I gave it that hook too.
6656440	6657440	Okay.
6660440	6664440	Look how big my little guys are.
6666440	6667440	They're so big.
6667440	6668440	No.
6673440	6674440	I'm just...
6674440	6677440	We could honestly just speed it to the fight again.
6678440	6680440	I like taking my time, you know?
6680440	6682440	It's not all about a race.
6683440	6685440	Sometimes it's about the drone.
6685440	6687440	And now I'm mad I dropped that trinket
6687440	6690440	because it didn't occur to me I could do a victory lap.
6690440	6692440	But it was the best thing to do at the time.
6700440	6704440	So we just accidentally skipped an entire floor.
6704440	6710440	Telepills has a chance to take you to the error room.
6710440	6714440	Which is what I managed to do successfully.
6716440	6719440	I don't know why that one broke my mantle,
6719440	6720440	but the other ones didn't.
6723440	6724440	Oh well.
6726440	6727440	That's unfortunate.
6729440	6731440	I did not expect a...
6731440	6733440	I am error room from that.
6733440	6736440	Well, we might get a planetarium.
6736440	6737440	You know what?
6737440	6738440	We might get a planetarium.
6739440	6741440	Spawn's a devil beggar, sure.
6744440	6745440	I don't have health.
6747440	6750440	You're asking the wrong Isaac player for health right now.
6750440	6751440	I'm gonna pop my ult.
6753440	6755440	Now we do have...
6758440	6760440	We got fun guys.
6760440	6763440	So I get a size down and I get range and speed up.
6763440	6765440	So my hitbox is like smaller.
6765440	6766440	My...
6766440	6768440	My followers are bigger than me.
6768440	6769440	My little...
6769440	6771440	Familiar, it's not follower, sorry.
6771440	6774440	Are literally bigger than me in the game.
6774440	6777440	I love being tiny, it's so cute.
6780440	6781440	The gate.
6781440	6783440	You have type cent chance to ignore damage.
6783440	6785440	Oh, I forgot about that too.
6785440	6788440	Right, so we're supposed to have upgraded arcades now.
6790440	6792440	Is this the upgraded arcade experience?
6792440	6794440	Because it doesn't look like it.
6794440	6795440	I can tell you that much.
6795440	6796440	Look, shite.
6799440	6801440	Damn right we are.
6801440	6804440	I love being tiny, it's another way to say that you like...
6804440	6805440	Giant?
6805440	6807440	Why do you think there's a giant here?
6807440	6811440	Why do you think she can be as tall as a skyscraper, huh?
6812440	6814440	I made it that way.
6814440	6815440	Did I use my ult?
6815440	6816440	I'm just gonna pop it.
6816440	6817440	I can never remember.
6818440	6821440	The damage, I know.
6821440	6824440	And it's only going up every time we get more money.
6824440	6825440	Money.
6825440	6826440	Money.
6826440	6828440	Call me Mr. Krabs.
6832440	6833440	Okay.
6834440	6837440	Gonna let the game do its thing.
6841440	6843440	I do have a sock.
6844440	6849440	Now the explosion can hurt me, but it's a homing explosion though.
6849440	6850440	How kill was that?
6851440	6853440	What do you mean it's super dangerous and I shouldn't do it?
6853440	6854440	What?
6854440	6856440	Oh come on, we're just having fun.
6858440	6860440	What do you mean this is so risky and I shouldn't have picked that up?
6860440	6863440	Oh come on, live a little.
6863440	6866440	You're such a worrier little weak one.
6866440	6867440	No way.
6867440	6868440	Pop ult.
6874440	6875440	Gumpers?
6875440	6877440	We got gumpers.
6877440	6878440	Yup.
6879440	6881440	And we got gimpers.
6881440	6882440	We're in a gimp suit.
6882440	6884440	Any hero members?
6886440	6888440	We've got a gimp mask.
6888440	6890440	I'm not even kidding.
6890440	6892440	It's actually in the game.
6892440	6894440	Perfection.
6894440	6895440	That's a big boy.
6895440	6898440	Gen 1, the crater is barely disguised.
6898440	6899440	Pink.
6899440	6900440	Honestly.
6900440	6901440	It was so fun.
6901440	6912440	Now I'll also say Gen 2 is not being created in my image with my particular interest in mind.
6912440	6925440	However, depending on a few things, it's very unique what we're appealing to.
6925440	6926440	What's the rib of greed?
6926440	6929440	5% more coins and fewer hearts from room clear.
6929440	6931440	Greed and super greed no longer appear.
6931440	6932440	I mean, sure.
6934440	6936440	Whoa, what did I just...
6937440	6938440	Experimental.
6938440	6939440	Shot speed up.
6939440	6940440	Let's go.
6942440	6943440	Not good.
6943440	6944440	I like it.
6944440	6946440	Considering how your luck was at the start, this is quite a turnaround.
6946440	6948440	And whose image is it created?
6948440	6949440	The janitor?
6949440	6950440	No, the concept.
6950440	6951440	I submit what I want.
6951440	6954440	I'll show you how it works behind the scenes.
6954440	6958440	But I submit what I want and either I get it or not.
6958440	6961440	And I just send an art focus board.
6961440	6967440	Again, with the second concept artist, I sent her a board of stuff I was interested in.
6967440	6970440	She sent me back her version of that.
6970440	6971440	Does that make sense?
6971440	6972440	That makes sense.
6972440	6973440	That's English.
6976440	6978440	That's how it's been done.
6978440	6980440	But again, I'll show you all the behind the scenes.
6980440	6987440	Obviously, Gen 1 was a bit chaotic because it was my first time ever doing anything like that.
6987440	6990440	So, it was rather...
6991440	6993440	It was a stressful time.
6993440	6995440	Let's put it that way.
6995440	6999440	But the reason why I'm so happy to talk about...
6999440	7003440	And uncomfortable to talk about Generation 2 is because...
7003440	7006440	It takes a year for...
7006440	7009440	God, balls of steel again.
7009440	7012440	Again, it gives us two soul hearts, which is just fantastic.
7013440	7016440	God, birthrate on Cana's Bazaar.
7018440	7020440	I don't have time for these machines.
7020440	7022440	They're going to take too long.
7022440	7024440	You know those flames can spawn hearts?
7024440	7026440	I didn't... when bombed?
7026440	7027440	No.
7029440	7030440	What's in here?
7030440	7031440	La bomba.
7033440	7039440	Now, if I could get blue fly from the shop, that would be great.
7039440	7041440	Hive mind, not blue fly, sorry.
7041440	7042440	Hive mind.
7044440	7045440	No.
7045440	7046440	But nice try.
7047440	7049440	Made in mommy's image.
7049440	7051440	Gotta love the wounds.
7052440	7054440	I'm not reading that one out, but you're welcome.
7054440	7057440	It's literally like top tier.
7057440	7059440	Sorry, I don't care what anyone says.
7059440	7060440	That's weird.
7060440	7062440	Good thing it's fantasy then.
7062440	7063440	Smile.
7063440	7068440	Upon death, we spawn Isaac in the same room with half a heart.
7068440	7070440	Speed and massive size then.
7070440	7072440	Wait, so I can be a tiny baby?
7075440	7080440	Wait, you didn't know about the blue flies giving blue hearts when blown up?
7080440	7082440	They are very much like a ball.
7082440	7083440	You didn't?
7083440	7084440	Wait, what?
7084440	7086440	You didn't know about the blue...
7086440	7088440	Oh, the blue fire is giving soul hearts.
7088440	7090440	Yes, no, I knew about that.
7090440	7092440	She says that she walks right into it.
7092440	7094440	No, I did know about that.
7094440	7095440	Why not?
7095440	7096440	We might as well do this.
7096440	7098440	I'll blitz this over you.
7100440	7102440	Yeah, good luck surviving this.
7102440	7104440	Yeah, that's right.
7106440	7108440	Now we do the boss fight.
7108440	7110440	Unless we want to do the angel.
7110440	7112440	I can be your angel or your devil.
7114440	7116440	I can't see shit.
7116440	7118440	Yeah, it does happen.
7122440	7124440	Let's not waste too much time.
7124440	7126440	I don't want to waste your time.
7126440	7128440	I want it to be entertaining.
7128440	7129440	I want it to be peak.
7129440	7130440	I want it to be high.
7130440	7132440	Conga time.
7132440	7134440	Like, game Isaac be like,
7134440	7135440	we go up this time?
7135440	7136440	Yes, we can go up.
7139440	7142440	Hey, we can get shooting orbital.
7142440	7143440	Oh, that's so good.
7143440	7145440	Oh, thank you, game.
7145440	7147440	No, really, you shouldn't have.
7147440	7148440	You should not have.
7148440	7149440	Just keep that.
7150440	7151440	Strongly move ball.
7152440	7155440	Cathedral music is my fave in the game.
7155440	7157440	I really like,
7158440	7159440	is it Ghana?
7159440	7161440	No, wait, that's the country.
7162440	7163440	Hold on.
7164440	7166440	The mausoleums?
7168440	7169440	It's not Ghana.
7169440	7171440	I'm sure that's the country.
7172440	7174440	Yeah, Ghana is the country.
7175440	7176440	Gehena.
7176440	7177440	Gehena?
7177440	7178440	That sounds exactly.
7178440	7179440	Powerpill.
7180440	7181440	No, thank you.
7182440	7183440	Gehena.
7184440	7185440	Any Gehena
7186440	7187440	rappers?
7187440	7188440	I don't know if I should do that.
7188440	7191440	No, go all out on El Diablo.
7193440	7194440	Is it country?
7194440	7195440	You're probably talking about...
7195440	7196440	Yes, okay, outside.
7196440	7198440	Oh, wait, we're already on the last floor?
7198440	7200440	No, our last shop.
7201440	7202440	Cannot be.
7203440	7204440	Don't say such things to me.
7206440	7208440	I'm enjoying this run.
7210440	7212440	But yeah, if you play victory lap,
7212440	7213440	you can pretty much ignore everything.
7213440	7216440	If you won once, you can, you know, do it again type thing.
7218440	7219440	Wow.
7220440	7222440	Oh, wait, it's not open.
7222440	7223440	Open.
7225440	7226440	Open.
7226440	7228440	I just let the flies deal with them.
7230440	7231440	Please open.
7231440	7232440	Thank you.
7232440	7233440	Another victory lap.
7233440	7234440	No.
7234440	7236440	Okay, we'll take Poki Gold.
7237440	7239440	If clearing a room would yield the reward,
7239440	7240440	it gives you coins.
7240440	7241440	Sure.
7241440	7243440	Okay, maybe one more victory lap.
7243440	7244440	Just a little one.
7247440	7248440	No.
7248440	7250440	I don't want one makes you larger.
7250440	7251440	You suck.
7251440	7253440	I'm back to being normal size.
7253440	7254440	Okay, maybe...
7257440	7259440	We know where the secret rooms are,
7259440	7261440	because we just picked up Tuesia map.
7263440	7264440	Wow.
7267440	7268440	What's in here?
7268440	7269440	A bomb.
7269440	7270440	Okay, so that was a waste.
7271440	7272440	We're not getting many bomb drops.
7272440	7275440	That's my only ditches of my complaint.
7275440	7276440	Oh my God, you're complaining about the game
7276440	7277440	that you're smurfing right now?
7277440	7278440	Yeah.
7279440	7280440	What?
7280440	7282440	See, if we had Keeper's sack,
7282440	7284440	I would have picked this up possibly,
7284440	7286440	but I do like that we have infinite health.
7288440	7289440	I'm not sure.
7293440	7294440	Any bombs?
7295440	7296440	Pills.
7296440	7297440	Two soul hearts.
7297440	7298440	Adult.
7298440	7301440	50% to try and die.
7301440	7303440	The die appears only then the die doesn't pick up.
7308440	7309440	Balls.
7309440	7310440	One makes you larger.
7310440	7311440	One makes you larger.
7312440	7313440	Do we want that?
7314440	7316440	I don't think so.
7316440	7318440	I've not used it, so I don't think I want it.
7319440	7320440	Because that's how it works, right?
7320440	7321440	If you've never used it before you.
7321440	7323440	I think there might be a secret room.
7323440	7324440	There's not.
7325440	7326440	I was going to say,
7326440	7328440	how have I not consumed all the pills yet?
7328440	7329440	I feel like...
7331440	7333440	I've seen them all at this point.
7334440	7335440	Day's fast proof.
7335440	7337440	Mummy, can you check for marked rocks at all?
7338440	7339440	I'm full health.
7340440	7342440	Is that naughty of me to ignore them?
7346440	7347440	Oh, we got boss rush.
7347440	7348440	Sure.
7349440	7350440	Do you want me to go up, right?
7350440	7351440	You wanted me to go up.
7351440	7352440	Let's go get this.
7352440	7353440	And then we'll do boss rush.
7354440	7356440	Yeah, that's perfect for what we need.
7357440	7358440	No effect from BFF.
7359440	7360440	Stinky.
7361440	7363440	And then boss rush is in here.
7364440	7365440	Ready?
7365440	7366440	Right, we can take...
7367440	7368440	Taking damage reduces.
7368440	7370440	So that's kind of like the way for it.
7371440	7372440	Isaac's movement.
7373440	7374440	Charges forward.
7375440	7376440	Dies in one hit.
7376440	7377440	Oh, that's terrible.
7377440	7378440	Um...
7379440	7382440	I guess this is technically the way for after one hit.
7384440	7386440	Abel, my brother that I perished.
7388440	7389440	We'll do the sea bomb.
7395440	7397440	They're already perishing.
7398440	7401440	I can't remember how many rounds there are,
7401440	7403440	but I think there's like eleven or something.
7404440	7405440	But we'll...
7406440	7407440	We're just gonna send it.
7408440	7409440	To no one's surprise,
7409440	7411440	we're just gonna spam upwards.
7412440	7413440	Boss rush?
7413440	7415440	More like massacre, exactly.
7416440	7418440	Um, if you are trying to get unlocks,
7418440	7420440	unfortunately victory lap,
7420440	7422440	like this doesn't count for unlocks.
7422440	7423440	So don't...
7423440	7424440	Don't think you've got a way out.
7424440	7426440	I thought I was so smart doing this.
7426440	7427440	I was like,
7427440	7429440	I will get all my unlocks to be a victory lap,
7429440	7431440	because how can anyone naturally get boss rush?
7432440	7433440	Uh, no.
7433440	7434440	I...
7434440	7436440	My first boss rush was on Eve.
7436440	7439440	I accidentally got it on her without realising.
7439440	7440440	I was like,
7440440	7441440	Oh, what's this room?
7441440	7443440	Uh, and...
7443440	7446440	Yeah, basically stress myself out to high heaven.
7447440	7448440	Who...
7448440	7449440	Who or where is this enemy?
7450440	7451440	Ah, there we go.
7452440	7454440	At least give them a chance, you bully.
7454440	7456440	No, I need my full health.
7457440	7459440	Give full health or perish.
7462440	7464440	Could you imagine you end up doing enough victory laps
7464440	7465440	to the point the game crashes?
7465440	7467440	Well, funny you mentioned that.
7467440	7469440	If you do enough victory laps,
7469440	7472440	the game actually starts removing your items.
7473440	7475440	And then you become the lost.
7475440	7477440	It's really bizarre.
7477440	7478440	It just happens.
7479440	7483440	I do not want chocolate overridden by C-section.
7483440	7486440	Damage scales with the charge time.
7487440	7488440	Wait.
7488440	7490440	It's overridden by C-section.
7490440	7492440	Yeah, so I keep C-section.
7494440	7497440	No, I don't want to add to the charge time.
7498440	7499440	What did I just pick?
7499440	7501440	Did I pick something up there?
7503440	7504440	Health up.
7504440	7505440	Sure.
7505440	7506440	Sure.
7506440	7507440	One singular health up.
7507440	7508440	Chucky milk.
7508440	7509440	Name a more iconic duo then.
7509440	7510440	Oh, hey, what's this?
7510440	7513440	An incoherent stream and I'll scream and I'll wait.
7514440	7515440	You're always stressing.
7515440	7516440	I mean, one of them is bar.
7516440	7517440	It's not really useful.
7517440	7518440	Yeah.
7519440	7522440	I think we'll pass on Chucky milk because that...
7522440	7523440	I don't know.
7523440	7525440	It says chargeable tears.
7525440	7527440	Damage scales with charge time.
7527440	7528440	Wait, no.
7528440	7529440	If it comp...
7529440	7530440	Does it complement?
7531440	7533440	Maybe it complements?
7533440	7534440	I have no idea.
7534440	7536440	It didn't really state it changed anything.
7537440	7538440	Sure.
7538440	7539440	Let's go.
7539440	7542440	I don't know if I made it worse or better.
7542440	7544440	Somebody come get her.
7545440	7547440	She didn't just like us.
7549440	7551440	We go arcade with this.
7551440	7553440	And of course, I can't see my health.
7553440	7555440	Because why would I be able to?
7555440	7558440	I'm going to pulp this to make sure that we get our Chucky item.
7559440	7562440	No, we need more damage.
7563440	7564440	I do need more damage.
7564440	7565440	I can hear my data weak.
7565440	7567440	He's making a call for me.
7568440	7570440	Make me a T-ball yet out of me.
7574440	7575440	Okay.
7575440	7577440	We might be able to get an item out of this.
7577440	7579440	Nope, that was wishful thinking.
7579440	7582440	We do love a bit of wishful thinking around these parts, don't we?
7582440	7583440	Yes.
7583440	7585440	So actually, this is a little thing.
7585440	7589440	So you see how we can see top right the other secret room?
7589440	7591440	Because it's a super secret room.
7591440	7592440	That's an indicator.
7592440	7595440	It's actually where the boss fight is.
7598440	7599440	I did consider it.
7599440	7601440	It's very plausible.
7602440	7611440	I think my landlord is nice enough to let me install a temporary pool.
7612440	7614440	I mean, I put a damage up a bit.
7616440	7618440	Give us film towel kits.
7619440	7622440	Oh yeah, we should be picking up money because we have...
7628440	7629440	That pool.
7629440	7630440	Your dad would make you tea.
7630440	7631440	Yeah.
7632440	7634440	It's kind of custom.
7635440	7637440	You know, you make your family member a cup of tea.
7637440	7639440	Like when you go, do you want a cup of tea?
7639440	7640440	You offer it to each other?
7640440	7641440	Who or where?
7641440	7642440	Whoa!
7643440	7644440	Oops.
7646440	7649440	Oh, we get mother transformation as well.
7649440	7650440	Yes, mother.
7653440	7655440	Oh, random rune shard.
7655440	7658440	We're going to step over art tile.
7658440	7659440	Maybe we'll get...
7659440	7660440	No, that didn't work.
7661440	7662440	Well, we tried our best.
7663440	7664440	I can't always work out.
7664440	7665440	Whoa!
7668440	7670440	17.68.
7670440	7673440	This is getting astronomical.
7674440	7675440	Two soul hearts.
7675440	7676440	I'll hold on to you.
7677440	7678440	I'm going to hold on to that.
7678440	7679440	100%.
7681440	7683440	Thank you for the tip, really legend.
7684440	7686440	I definitely considered for 3D.
7686440	7688440	I'm not going to pretend otherwise.
7689440	7690440	Definitely considered.
7692440	7694440	More damage because reasons.
7694440	7695440	Why, yeah.
7695440	7696440	A library again?
7698440	7699440	Oh, wow.
7700440	7703440	You can pop this one because it gives us a wee familiar.
7705440	7707440	Oh, I've got a wee fly that goes around me.
7707440	7708440	Save first.
7712440	7713440	Imagine.
7713440	7714440	Interesting.
7714440	7715440	Here I come.
7715440	7717440	It's common that the younger one serves the older one.
7720440	7722440	Not in my household.
7725440	7728440	We're just kind of like mom's pearl.
7730440	7732440	No, that's definitely not my household.
7732440	7734440	Everyone's just nice to each other's smile.
7734440	7736440	It doesn't matter when you were born.
7738440	7740440	Because that's like cheesy doodling.
7740440	7742440	I was born for...
7742440	7744440	It's giving I was born first.
7744440	7746440	That's what children argue on the playground.
7746440	7747440	I was born first.
7747440	7749440	You have to be nice to me and do as I say.
7749440	7750440	No, that's not how it works.
7750440	7752440	Not from around these parts.
7752440	7753440	Not from around here.
7755440	7758440	Age has no correlation to how nice you can be.
7761440	7763440	I mean, we don't need it.
7764440	7766440	But we're going to take up the money.
7767440	7769440	Because it's not about the money, money, money.
7773440	7776440	I don't see the appeal of pole dancing.
7776440	7777440	You don't?
7779440	7781440	Isn't it like normal dancing?
7781440	7783440	No, it's like supposed to be all...
7783440	7786440	Have you never been to the Unicorn Palace in GTA?
7788440	7791440	You've never been to the Unicorn Palace in GTA?
7792440	7793440	In no way.
7793440	7794440	In no way.
7795440	7797440	3D Ring Fit Adventure Stream.
7797440	7800440	I do have a Ring Fit coming out next week.
7800440	7801440	Next week.
7803440	7806440	But yeah, if I get 3D, I'd 100% be down.
7807440	7809440	I'll pop my ult, but I don't think I need it.
7811440	7813440	Sure, let's go in the secret room.
7813440	7815440	So again, we can see where the other secret room is.
7815440	7817440	And it's an indicator that most likely...
7820440	7822440	Who or what did that?
7822440	7823440	Oh, not up to it right now.
7824440	7826440	I'm going to pop this guy so we can get increased.
7826440	7827440	Yeah, there we go.
7828440	7829440	A 1 tooth piece.
7830440	7831440	Imagine...
7833440	7835440	Oh, we get damage up for it.
7835440	7836440	Let's go.
7838440	7840440	19 damage.
7841440	7842440	Hair tier.
7843440	7847440	And that doesn't even include all of the other effects that come with it.
7849440	7851440	I'm surprised we're actually getting room cleared.
7851440	7853440	Wait, the boss room isn't this way?
7853440	7855440	I can't believe that I've been lied to.
7856440	7858440	Reduces all Devil deals to a heart.
7858440	7860440	It doesn't reduce the other ones though.
7860440	7861440	No, I've actually...
7861440	7863440	My item I've got right now...
7864440	7865440	I use Black Feather.
7866440	7870440	Every evil item I own, my damage goes up by 0.5.
7870440	7875440	And because we're taking tons of Devil deals, it's going up.
7880440	7881440	I'll pop my ult.
7882440	7883440	Okay, well, I shouldn't have.
7883440	7884440	But I did.
7885440	7888440	Whoa, we get fire rate up and 3 coins.
7893440	7895440	I think he just passed the boss room.
7895440	7898440	I saw a health bar on the screen for a moment.
7898440	7899440	No, that can't...
7899440	7901440	It doesn't work like that, you goober.
7902440	7903440	You're teasing me.
7903440	7905440	That's not how it works.
7908440	7910440	Oh wait, why does it go that way?
7913440	7914440	Okay, let's...
7914440	7916440	Oh, we're at 20 per tier now.
7919440	7920440	Oh, will we do Hush?
7920440	7921440	Let's do Hush.
7923440	7925440	Oh, it's Dark Bomb.
7925440	7927440	Okay, you come in and then...
7927440	7929440	Killing an enemy has a chance to spawn the ghost.
7929440	7930440	Here, you come in too.
7932440	7934440	And then we'll go do Hush.
7934440	7939440	So Hush is the last time Isaac breathes.
7940440	7945440	Hush can't fight back because of the shielded tears.
7945440	7947440	Hey, Stony, can you kill the boss again?
7947440	7948440	I blinked.
7948440	7950440	Yeah, I can kill that boss again.
7954440	7956440	Oh, that was a good kill.
7956440	7958440	Oh, I had balls of steel on me.
7963440	7964440	Oh, the music's on.
7964440	7965440	It's the music's on.
7965440	7967440	We've already got last...
7967440	7968440	Wait, how did it double up?
7968440	7970440	Would it have just become bigger?
7970440	7971440	No, I wouldn't.
7972440	7979440	So normally there is a crawl space in these rooms.
7981440	7985440	I do say the term normally in quotation marks.
7989440	7992440	Okay, I do say the word normally there's a hidden...
7992440	7999440	Oh, grants immunity to explosions and damage.
8003440	8008440	Okay, normally there's a hidden crawl space.
8009440	8011440	Normally...
8011440	8012440	Yes!
8012440	8013440	There we go.
8013440	8015440	Normally there's a hidden crawl space.
8015440	8017440	And we got Hush.
8017440	8018440	Okay.
8018440	8020440	I love how Stony plays the same game over and over.
8020440	8022440	She just let me through for real though.
8022440	8024440	Bandit only took me like...
8025440	8027440	Chose between two items?
8027440	8029440	No, that's terrible.
8030440	8033440	I think I'm better just keeping my minions.
8036440	8038440	I'll pick up a tally pill.
8039440	8042440	Right, we are ready to take on old Hush.
8042440	8047440	If you look at the wall decorations, you can see the faces of the enemy.
8047440	8049440	Roll a d4 for the memes.
8049440	8050440	Are you kidding?
8050440	8052440	I've never had such a good run.
8053440	8054440	That's kind of funny though.
8057440	8059440	Maybe we go to Delirium.
8061440	8062440	What we do, Delirium?
8062440	8063440	We could.
8063440	8064440	Where is we?
8065440	8066440	Get over here.
8072440	8073440	A monkey on a pool.
8073440	8076440	Well, you need to give me time to learn.
8076440	8077440	Thank you for the tip, Iron Reaper.
8077440	8079440	You need to give me time to learn.
8080440	8084440	But, I mean, a bit of cheeky 3D tracking on.
8084440	8085440	Get me going.
8085440	8088440	We roll your whole bill, should we?
8090440	8093440	Right, how about we go take on Delirium.
8093440	8095440	And I'll re-roll my whole bill.
8099440	8102440	I'm gonna not go well at all.
8103440	8105440	I'm not even paying attention.
8105440	8106440	I'm just spamming.
8106440	8107440	I don't even know if I've lost any health.
8107440	8111440	Look at the purgatory just going crazy.
8111440	8113440	See all those little red guys?
8115440	8120440	Oh, is that why I'm getting fed pills by a dark bum?
8123440	8126440	Alright, we'll re-roll into Delirium and see what happens.
8126440	8129440	I'm gonna regret it so much, but why not?
8130440	8132440	Whoa, he's crying.
8132440	8134440	Don't cry.
8140440	8141440	Or should?
8141440	8143440	Maybe I shouldn't re-roll.
8144440	8145440	I'm scared.
8145440	8146440	Do we have to re-roll?
8146440	8148440	Okay, I don't want to do Delirium.
8148440	8151440	If we do Delirium, am I allowed to not re-roll?
8151440	8153440	Because I quite like what I've got.
8153440	8156440	I've got like Guppy, I've got Mum, I've got Flay,
8156440	8158440	I've got Spectre, I've got everything.
8158440	8159440	Don't re-roll, don't re-roll.
8159440	8160440	Okay, okay, okay.
8160440	8161440	Thank you.
8161440	8162440	Sorry.
8162440	8163440	Right, well, do Delirium is...
8163440	8164440	Thank you.
8167440	8170440	I am doing a victory lap.
8170440	8173440	That is why I have so many items on my Persons.
8174440	8181440	That little flag means I am on a run.
8183440	8185440	I'm on a rune.
8186440	8187440	Speed up.
8187440	8188440	I'm already...
8188440	8191440	My speed drives the telepills.
8193440	8195440	Oh wait, you can't get a...
8196440	8201440	I was gonna say you can't get an I am error with this kind of stuff.
8202440	8203440	Alright, what's in here?
8204440	8206440	We've got the Headless Horseman.
8206440	8207440	She's on a victory lap.
8207440	8208440	Don't risk it yet.
8208440	8210440	Well, do Delirium.
8210440	8211440	Health?
8211440	8213440	Don't really need health.
8217440	8219440	Sure, we can open that.
8219440	8221440	Again, with Memic Chest, we can just straight up open them
8221440	8229440	because we have Holy Mantles, so it's not a problem for us.
8230440	8233440	We are gonna get the Secret Room that's over here.
8235440	8237440	What's inside?
8237440	8239440	Absolutely nothing.
8240440	8242440	We've been trolled by the one...
8242440	8246440	Oh, well we'll take the money because again, we have deeper pockets.
8246440	8251440	We actually should be picking up every single penny, but I'm being lazy.
8253440	8254440	Something's happening over there.
8254440	8257440	Debizzle can pick up all these.
8258440	8260440	What just happened?
8260440	8262440	Oh, nothing's getting me.
8262440	8263440	What did you just throw at me?
8263440	8266440	I don't know what he gave me, but thank you for it anyway.
8266440	8268440	I'm quite happy with that.
8269440	8271440	Health turns off Polaroid.
8271440	8275440	Yeah, I'm not gonna pick up any red.
8277440	8280440	Again, we are gonna try and pick up as much coin.
8281440	8284440	Got Toxic Shock because I've got so much damage.
8284440	8288440	Toxic Shock is actually killing enemies as we enter the room.
8290440	8292440	I mean, I'll take a quarter.
8292440	8294440	You don't have to tell me twice.
8294440	8298440	We just went up like a full mom's heart.
8300440	8305440	Oh, tears. Absolutely.
8308440	8310440	We can fly over everything.
8313440	8317440	Now, Delirium can only spawn...
8317440	8320440	Strony Dominating is just natural.
8320440	8321440	So you admit it.
8321440	8323440	I'm a dumb. Got you.
8324440	8325440	And 4 Key.
8326440	8328440	You admit it yourself.
8328440	8329440	Thank you.
8329440	8331440	There is a tentacle here.
8332440	8334440	Maybe an item.
8334440	8336440	We got money. We got money.
8337440	8340440	We don't need that debuzzle, but thank you.
8340440	8342440	I've been in that room, so we'll go this way next.
8342440	8343440	We'll pick up.
8343440	8345440	No, you big sub. How dare you?
8346440	8348440	You just admitted I wasn't.
8350440	8353440	We get a stat up from this pill, whatever it's gonna be.
8354440	8355440	Luck.
8355440	8357440	I think we've got enough luck for one day.
8357440	8359440	I'm gonna be honest, little guy.
8361440	8363440	Dumb only in this game.
8363440	8365440	Mummy gets moonies.
8368440	8372440	We're fully, we're fully all in on black hearts, actually,
8372440	8375440	which makes us super potent.
8375440	8379440	And we got page 2, which means we do extra damage.
8380440	8384440	Now, I'm curious if delirium, because we know where the other secret room is.
8384440	8387440	If delirium is next to that secret room.
8388440	8389440	Adverture.
8390440	8392440	If that is an indication.
8392440	8394440	We're at 23 damage.
8394440	8396440	Can we get 24?
8396440	8400440	Right, I'm gonna go up on purpose to try and collect as much money as possible.
8400440	8404440	And get as much boss fights for extra items as possible.
8406440	8408440	Cheeky item? No.
8408440	8411440	24 now, between every shot.
8411440	8413440	That's amazing.
8414440	8417440	There's so much going on the screen, though.
8422440	8424440	Time to mega-mush in a rock bottom.
8424440	8428440	I don't have rock bottom unlocked, I don't think.
8428440	8432440	I think you need to do boss rush Jacob and Isle on hard mode.
8433440	8437440	I don't even think I have rock bottom.
8437440	8439440	I wish I could get rock bottom.
8439440	8444440	I'm so curious to unlock death certificate, but I'm so far away, so...
8444440	8447440	I really suck on Bethany.
8447440	8449440	I have a really hard time on that.
8449440	8451440	Where am I going?
8461440	8463440	Anonymous, thank you for the tip.
8463440	8466440	I'm curious, do you spend time playing with someone special?
8466440	8470440	Or would you say you're competitive gaming to win?
8473440	8475440	I...
8475440	8476440	I guess?
8476440	8481440	Because I like playing with you guys, I'd rather have quality time playing multiplayer games.
8481440	8485440	If I'm not good at a game, I don't play it.
8485440	8488440	That sounds like such a sore loser, but I am.
8488440	8492440	If I'm not good at the game, I'm just like, what's the point?
8492440	8494440	I suck.
8494440	8497440	I don't want to put my time into something I suck.
8497440	8499440	But Elden Ring, for example.
8499440	8501440	I'm absolutely terrible at Elden Ring.
8501440	8504440	I have never had so much fun playing a game.
8504440	8507440	Commentate and stuff in my face.
8507440	8512440	You guys make that game so fun for me, and you make it playable for me.
8512440	8516440	Because if I had to play it the natural way, like the actual way...
8519440	8522440	I don't think I could enjoy it, so it's thanks to you guys,
8522440	8527440	I can literally enjoy a game that unironically wouldn't be accessible to me
8527440	8532440	due to my stubbornness of, oh, if I'm not good at the game, I'm not playing it.
8532440	8537440	Because I don't spend overwork myself,
8537440	8539440	and then go, oh, you know what?
8539440	8543440	I fancy getting absolutely demolished in a game for eight hours.
8543440	8546440	I don't really tickle my fancy.
8546440	8549440	It might for some people, but for me, yeah, not really.
8549440	8552440	That is a friendly enemy before you panic.
8552440	8554440	Please don't panic, guys.
8554440	8560440	We've got two balls of steel pills, so I'm going to keep them on hold.
8560440	8562440	We've already got max speed, so...
8566440	8568440	Do you have any tainted unlocks?
8568440	8572440	I do, I will show you after we finish this victory.
8574440	8576440	It's a turd, it's a brownie.
8576440	8579440	That's kind of the point of Souls game.
8579440	8582440	Well, I mean, I can enjoy it with you guys, so I don't count.
8582440	8584440	Really, alabaster box?
8584440	8587440	Right, you should be ashamed of yourself.
8588440	8592440	More like, full of rubbish box.
8592440	8594440	Thank you, I'll be here all week.
8594440	8597440	Right, I'm purposely avoiding that last boss room,
8597440	8600440	but I think that's where our enemy resides.
8602440	8603440	By the Pope.
8613440	8615440	I'd basically come to you and be like,
8615440	8617440	Riefling, I can't get past this part,
8617440	8620440	and then you have to come through and get me past it.
8620440	8625440	And then 20 minutes later, Riefling, I can't do it.
8625440	8627440	Thanks for the tip, Anonymous.
8628440	8631440	Literally, you're trying to do your own gaming session.
8631440	8634440	I'm like, Riefling, please, I can't do this.
8635440	8637440	Right, it looks like...
8639440	8640440	We're here.
8642440	8644440	What the f...
8644440	8645440	What?
8646440	8647440	Emmanuel Coppa?
8647440	8649440	Coppa D's nuts and my mouth.
8649440	8650440	Thank you for the 50.
8650440	8651440	Gluck Gluck.
8651440	8652440	Are you serious?
8653440	8654440	That's a lot.
8654440	8656440	Thank you, Emmanuel.
8657440	8659440	Jeez, Louise.
8662440	8663440	Wow.
8665440	8666440	Thank you very much.
8666440	8668440	So we're like a big brother to you,
8668440	8670440	then playing the hard parts for you.
8670440	8671440	I mean, literally.
8671440	8672440	Yeah.
8673440	8675440	Thank you so much.
8675440	8678440	Congrats to everyone who caught that with their faces.
8679440	8681440	You might have a prompt in chat.
8682440	8686440	That'll tell you, like, oh, I think Delirium's in that room, by the way.
8686440	8688440	You might have a prompt in chat where you have to, like,
8688440	8689440	enable the thingy-ma-bobber.
8689440	8693440	You just do that, and you'll hopefully catch it.
8693440	8696440	I do have new emotes coming very soon to you.
8696440	8698440	Very, very soon to you.
8699440	8701440	The girls are getting their emotes first,
8701440	8703440	because, you know, we can be patient.
8703440	8705440	But thank you so much, Emmanuel Coppa.
8705440	8706440	That's crazy.
8707440	8711440	I'm still assigning people to even get the gifted membership.
8711440	8713440	And thank you, Broly Legend.
8713440	8714440	Not gonna lie, I would love that.
8714440	8716440	Yeah, you'd love carrying me in my games.
8716440	8718440	Mummy's sitting on her lap as we help her.
8718440	8720440	Emote teaser.
8720440	8722440	Blast from the past.
8722440	8723440	Are you squidding me right now?
8723440	8726440	Stroney's the little sister that gets you to do the hard parts of the game,
8726440	8730440	and in return, she does the hard parts for you.
8730440	8732440	Ay, yeah.
8732440	8734440	What's that mean?
8734440	8736440	I don't think I know what I mean.
8736440	8738440	Ah, shot and behavior.
8738440	8740440	Holy crap.
8740440	8744440	Literally, it's still going, Emmanuel.
8746440	8748440	It's still going, right?
8748440	8750440	Hydration check.
8750440	8753440	That last part isn't for you.
8753440	8755440	Oh, of you, and does the hard parts of you.
8755440	8757440	Oh, okay, okay, okay.
8759440	8760440	What a spammer.
8760440	8761440	I can't believe it.
8761440	8762440	No, I'm kidding.
8762440	8763440	Do not time anyone.
8763440	8765440	Jesus, are you joking?
8767440	8768440	Congrats on the membership.
8768440	8770440	Yeah, congrats on who caught it with her faces.
8770440	8772440	Oh, crap.
8772440	8773440	Thank you again, Emmanuel.
8773440	8775440	It's 50.
8775440	8776440	50.
8776440	8777440	That's a big number.
8777440	8779440	Okay, sometimes there's wee numbers,
8779440	8781440	and sometimes there's big numbers, okay?
8781440	8782440	That was a lot of money.
8782440	8784440	How much money was that?
8786440	8788440	Is that like $300?
8792440	8794440	Oh, God, that's insane.
8795440	8797440	Thank you, all by Isaac.
8797440	8799440	Small loan of a million dollars?
8799440	8800440	Exactly.
8800440	8801440	Yeah, okay.
8801440	8803440	Delirium was next to the secret room,
8803440	8805440	which is very curious.
8806440	8810440	Now, thankfully we do have lost contact,
8810440	8811440	but Delirium...
8811440	8813440	Now, Edmick Muffin...
8813440	8814440	Who goes there?
8825440	8827440	I mean, that sounds like a deal to me.
8828440	8830440	Thank you, tiny spiny.
8830440	8832440	Oh, I just lost my holy mantle.
8832440	8834440	Oh, no, I lost holy mantle and my blanket.
8834440	8836440	I actually had two because I'm just so good at the game.
8837440	8838440	Hold on.
8838440	8840440	I'm MLG pro-gaming.
8840440	8841440	I'm not owl.
8841440	8843440	I'm not even looking at the screen.
8843440	8844440	I'm cheating.
8847440	8848440	Wah!
8848440	8849440	It's ogre.
8850440	8851440	We're dead.
8854440	8855440	We did it!
8855440	8857440	We did Delirium.
8857440	8858440	Wee!
8860440	8861440	Oh, Parisic.
8866440	8868440	Are you squiddin' me right now?
8876440	8877440	Oh, I like that.
8877440	8878440	Hold on.
8879440	8882440	No, I like that because I can information dump on Isaac
8882440	8883440	and be like,
8883440	8885440	Thank you so much for getting me rock bottom.
8889440	8891440	Thank you so much for getting me rock bottom.
8891440	8893440	I need to return the favor now.
8896440	8901440	Isaac, my boy.
8901440	8902440	There he is.
8902440	8903440	We scale it in.
8903440	8905440	Look at his repel this.
8906440	8908440	His wee hip bones are jutting out.
8908440	8910440	Thank you, Anonymous, for the suggestion.
8910440	8911440	Thank you.
8911440	8912440	That is my concept now.
8912440	8914440	I now own the legal rights to that idea,
8914440	8916440	and no one else is allowed to do it.
8916440	8918440	Copyright holder, scrawny culls.
8918440	8928440	More like rockin' your bottom.
8928440	8930440	So that's dad walkin' away on the hill, rip dad.
8932440	8934440	He's walking away forever.
8936440	8937440	That was it.
8937440	8940440	That's the binding of Isaac repentance team.
8942440	8944440	Poor Isaacers, honestly.
8944440	8947440	Get her rock bottom so she can go down to your rock.
8948440	8952440	How long still until scrawny plays Roblox?
8952440	8953440	I've never played Roblox.
8953440	8955440	Now, I will say one thing.
8955440	8957440	I saw the funniest TikTok,
8957440	8960440	and it was like Roblox jumping course,
8960440	8964440	but you only jump by your mic getting activated,
8964440	8965440	and I was like,
8965440	8969440	could you imagine the noises all six of us would make on Roblox?
8969440	8970440	Being like,
8970440	8973440	whoa, whoa, like trying to get the mic to activate.
8973440	8976440	It would be absolutely a zoomer,
8976440	8977440	but she's never played Roblox.
8977440	8980440	Right, I'm gonna say something controversial,
8980440	8985440	but does Roblox no give you absolute five-year-old vibes?
8985440	8987440	I've seen people roleplay as a cashier
8987440	8988440	in a hairdresser in Roblox,
8988440	8989440	and I'm like,
8989440	8991440	I think this game's from the younger,
8991440	8994440	young, young, youngins, you know?
8994440	8996440	The ending song hunts my nerves.
8996440	8998440	Jesus loves you.
9000440	9003440	That's good, but the louder you scream, the higher you jump.
9003440	9004440	Roblox is like a kiddie game, I swear.
9004440	9006440	Yeah, it's like younger, zoomer.
9006440	9009440	Bro, it looks like it's for five-year-olds
9009440	9011440	that if they would get their first game,
9011440	9013440	I feel like that stream would get demonetized.
9013440	9016440	But anyway, this is my save file,
9016440	9020440	so for my tainted characters,
9020440	9023440	I've got tainted Isaac, Madeline, Cain,
9023440	9024440	but as you can see,
9024440	9029440	I have hardly achieved much and tainted.
9031440	9033440	Oh, it almost gets me like,
9033440	9035440	that's where Dad's singing to us.
9037440	9038440	But I've done Greed Mode.
9038440	9040440	I really like Greed Ear and Greed Mode.
9040440	9043440	I know a lot of people hate it, I don't mind it,
9043440	9046440	but there are quite a few that I haven't done.
9046440	9049440	Like, I've not unlocked Tainted Eden.
9049440	9051440	Lost, yeah, surprise, surprise,
9051440	9053440	I haven't got much about that.
9053440	9055440	What about the death penalty?
9055440	9058440	Lilith, Keeper, Polly on,
9058440	9061440	The Forgotten, Bethany,
9062440	9064440	Jacob is locked, I've not unlocked him,
9064440	9067440	but yeah, my tainted isn't very good.
9067440	9070440	Greed Mode, hey, taking Lilith to Greed Mode.
9070440	9073440	I don't know, what's for your tainted version?
9073440	9076440	Betrayal, Fetal Fury, and Jello.
9076440	9078440	Jello's pretty strong.
9079440	9080440	Jello's a strong ba-ba.
9080440	9083440	Jello has ult lock as well, if I'm not mistaken.
9083440	9086440	What, do you want to try a Greed on Lilith?
9087440	9088440	We can try it.
9088440	9091440	I don't expect to win, but we'll try it.
9091440	9094440	I always feel like clearing my safe and starting all over again
9094440	9095440	when I watch streams of this game.
9095440	9097440	Are you a god?
9099440	9100440	Oh wait, no!
9100440	9103440	I thought it was going to be Jello as an active item.
9103440	9105440	Oh no.
9105440	9108440	We are not making it out with this one, Chief.
9109440	9112440	Look how slow I am, I'm so sluggish.
9114440	9116440	Yeah, we're not making it alive.
9116440	9119440	Oh, we have lucky, oh wait, you don't get pills,
9119440	9121440	you need bi-pills in this game.
9122440	9123440	Ooh, it's not happening.
9123440	9126440	Thank you Anonymous for the tip again if I didn't say thank you,
9126440	9129440	because all I said was stealing your idea.
9129440	9132440	You have Honing and a Whip that does three times damage.
9134440	9137440	I mean, if it has Honing, there's a chance.
9138440	9142440	If it has Honing, come on Jello, if we can get BFF
9143440	9145440	in Treasure Box, I assume.
9145440	9147440	Oh my god, look at the...
9148440	9149440	Go Jello!
9149440	9151440	Keep me safe down here.
9152440	9154440	Wow, there's jobbies.
9157440	9160440	But I do not suspect I will win,
9160440	9162440	but that's not going to stop us, is it?
9163440	9165440	Come on Jello.
9165440	9167440	With that aimbot, come on Jello with that aimbot.
9167440	9168440	Hit him with it.
9169440	9171440	Don't shoot, just whip.
9171440	9172440	Oh no.
9172440	9174440	Wait, are you sure?
9175440	9176440	Oh.
9178440	9179440	Oh my god.
9180440	9181440	Oh, you're so right.
9181440	9182440	Wait, what hit me?
9182440	9183440	I don't know what hit me.
9183440	9184440	Something got me, I don't know what it was,
9184440	9186440	but I guess I deserved it.
9188440	9189440	Oh my gosh.
9189440	9191440	Hit him with it, whip.
9191440	9193440	Now watch me whip.
9193440	9195440	Now watch me, that must have been made so many times
9195440	9197440	considering how old this game is.
9198440	9200440	Yeah, dang.
9200440	9202440	I'm so slow though.
9202440	9204440	0.85 movement speed.
9205440	9207440	I'm late, but I still made it.
9207440	9210440	You're lucky I was fatigued enough to
9210440	9212440	commit to this game mode.
9212440	9213440	I thought I was going to have my
9213440	9215440	freaking treasure box
9215440	9216440	thinking my bobber, but I don't.
9216440	9218440	I've forgotten what Feetal Fury was
9218440	9220440	or what my passenger was.
9221440	9223440	Is that the tummy thing?
9224440	9226440	I am whipping the crap out of this thing.
9227440	9228440	Wah.
9229440	9230440	Whoa.
9230440	9231440	Juke.
9231440	9232440	Juke, go away, Juke.
9232440	9233440	Go away.
9233440	9234440	Go away.
9236440	9238440	You have respect, my Paratain.
9238440	9240440	Oh my god, I feel like Cartman
9240440	9241440	because I'm so slow.
9242440	9243440	Okay, one more fight.
9243440	9245440	We're going to ignore the devil
9245440	9246440	deals.
9246440	9248440	We're going to go angel deals.
9250440	9253440	Oh wait, can Lilith only get a...
9253440	9255440	Oh, well that was very unfortunate.
9255440	9257440	Did not mean to lose that.
9257440	9258440	Ooh.
9258440	9259440	No, I can get angel deals.
9259440	9260440	Okay, that's fine.
9262440	9264440	We are a puppeteer now.
9264440	9266440	I wonder how many even got that
9266440	9267440	song reference.
9269440	9271440	I feel like that was popular now.
9271440	9272440	Watch me whip.
9273440	9274440	Watch me now.
9275440	9276440	Right.
9279440	9280440	These are all pish.
9281440	9282440	That can get people.
9283440	9284440	I'm probably going to regret this,
9284440	9285440	but I'm going to sacrifice...
9288440	9290440	That's why I regret it,
9290440	9292440	because you need to go in with sugar
9292440	9294440	and spice and everything nice.
9296440	9298440	Right, we'll take our monies.
9298440	9300440	Oh, I thought Jill could pick up a heart.
9301440	9302440	But we cannot.
9303440	9304440	Okay, let's go next.
9304440	9305440	Let's go next.
9305440	9306440	Let's not hang around.
9306440	9308440	Let's not beat around the bush.
9308440	9309440	Any beat-bushers?
9309440	9310440	Any bush beaters?
9310440	9311440	Sorry, I said it wrong.
9312440	9314440	That song was in almost every vine
9314440	9316440	bought back in the world store.
9316440	9317440	Right, we've got tier rate up,
9317440	9319440	so does that mean the whip is faster?
9322440	9323440	He's so fast.
9324440	9325440	He's such a baby.
9326440	9328440	Oh, we've got Haun.
9328440	9329440	I like Haun,
9329440	9331440	because he goes and does damage on his own.
9331440	9333440	Anything that goes away
9333440	9334440	and does damage on its own,
9334440	9335440	I'm like, are you?
9342440	9344440	Yeah, Jello's giving us the range
9344440	9345440	to not be attacked.
9346440	9348440	Right, pick up the key first
9349440	9350440	and then grab Haun,
9350440	9352440	because I think Haun's a cutie pie.
9352440	9353440	I like Haun,
9353440	9354440	because he goes and attacks
9354440	9355440	all the enemies for me.
9356440	9357440	Are you?
9357440	9359440	Wait, how does that work with Jello?
9363440	9364440	Oh, he spits out.
9364440	9366440	He spits out C-section.
9368440	9369440	Oh, my gosh.
9370440	9371440	I'm so lucky.
9373440	9374440	Oh.
9376440	9377440	Oh.
9386440	9388440	I'm here for it.
9390440	9391440	My yum heart.
9391440	9392440	Yum yum.
9393440	9394440	I like that.
9394440	9395440	Thank you, Anonymous,
9395440	9397440	for the suggestion and the tip.
9397440	9398440	I need to write all these down.
9398440	9399440	I need to get, like, a document,
9399440	9400440	because you guys give me
9400440	9401440	such good suggestions.
9401440	9403440	And I like making content
9403440	9404440	that you want to hear
9404440	9406440	versus what I think you want to hear.
9406440	9407440	Like, I'd rather...
9407440	9408440	Oh, my God, Haun is getting it.
9408440	9409440	Go, Haun, go.
9409440	9410440	Go, Haun, go.
9412440	9413440	I'd rather, like,
9413440	9415440	feel more confident writing stuff
9415440	9416440	that you guys, like, want
9416440	9418440	than me guessing that you want.
9418440	9420440	I don't know how I didn't get hit there.
9420440	9421440	I got...
9423440	9425440	Right, we kind of need a bomb.
9429440	9431440	Well, that's a bomb, all right.
9431440	9433440	That gives us health and a bomb.
9434440	9435440	Hmm.
9435440	9436440	I think that's...
9436440	9438440	Right, I know this seems crazy
9438440	9440440	because it doesn't do anything.
9444440	9446440	The odds of rolling a bomb
9446440	9447440	are terrible.
9447440	9449440	At least we have unlimited bomb.
9449440	9450440	Ooh!
9450440	9452440	That goes pepper's goods.
9452440	9453440	Nerd Girlfriend talks
9453440	9454440	about Isaac Lowell doing it
9454440	9455440	the entire time.
9455440	9456440	Well, I really, like,
9456440	9458440	I'm surprisingly enjoying it.
9458440	9459440	I don't know if you guys
9459440	9460440	like that.
9460440	9462440	I'm surprisingly enjoyed
9462440	9463440	writing Ignore.
9465440	9467440	I'm so surprised I liked it
9467440	9468440	because...
9468440	9470440	But it does, like, have funny things
9470440	9472440	where I could, like, be playing a game
9472440	9473440	in theory.
9473440	9474440	Oh, no, that was terrible.
9474440	9476440	Right, I'm not popping this anymore.
9476440	9478440	In theory, it could, like,
9478440	9480440	lead Rise to me having to carry on
9480440	9481440	with things like that.
9483440	9484440	Because it is just, like,
9484440	9485440	a bit of goofing off.
9486440	9487440	And I can be, like,
9487440	9488440	Girlfriend's addicted to
9488440	9490440	Binding of Isaac while she ignores
9490440	9491440	but gives you free use
9491440	9493440	ASMR, like, that kind of stuff.
9493440	9495440	Oh, I'm too slow!
9495440	9497440	How did I dodge that?
9499440	9501440	I have no idea how I dodged that.
9501440	9502440	That is hilarious.
9506440	9507440	That was...
9507440	9509440	I have no idea how that just occurred.
9511440	9512440	I know I should be whipping,
9512440	9514440	but I'm terrible, okay?
9515440	9517440	We're gonna blow up an angel.
9517440	9518440	That sounds terrible.
9525440	9526440	Okay, and then next...
9529440	9530440	Okay.
9530440	9531440	Oh, and we got a frickin'
9532440	9534440	and it's fearin' him!
9535440	9536440	Come on!
9537440	9538440	This is so good.
9538440	9540440	And we can sacrifice health
9540440	9542440	to get a bomb if we need a type thing.
9545440	9546440	Very nice.
9548440	9549440	Let me read the
9550440	9551440	suggestion again.
9561440	9562440	Ooh, baby.
9563440	9565440	Man, I've been an MVP, literally.
9567440	9568440	Casually just
9568440	9569440	Morgan everything.
9569440	9570440	Right.
9570440	9571440	I
9571440	9572440	can now go into the
9572440	9574440	curse rooms without any issues.
9576440	9579440	Some issues with the curse rooms.
9579440	9581440	I'm so slow!
9581440	9583440	Please, no more bombs.
9583440	9585440	No, I'm so slow!
9585440	9587440	That's what I didn't want.
9588440	9589440	And it happened anyway
9589440	9591440	because I'm too frickin' slow.
9593440	9594440	Now...
9596440	9598440	That's really good.
9599440	9600440	I'm gonna take it.
9600440	9601440	I know I probably shouldn't,
9601440	9603440	but that's really good.
9603440	9606440	Now, I can blow up
9607440	9608440	like that.
9609440	9610440	Yeah.
9611440	9612440	Okay, that's good.
9612440	9613440	I'll take the penny.
9614440	9615440	In for a penny,
9615440	9616440	in for a pound.
9617440	9618440	Your mama.
9618440	9620440	We are gonna blow him up as well.
9621440	9622440	As I said, now that we can
9622440	9624440	kind of sacrifice Red Heart
9624440	9625440	for that.
9625440	9626440	Strony a snail.
9626440	9627440	Honestly, snail confirmed for Jinto
9627440	9628440	because that was
9628440	9630440	absolute slow poke territory.
9630440	9631440	That was awful.
9633440	9634440	I mean...
9635440	9636440	We could maybe do one attempt
9636440	9638440	at the secret room.
9643440	9644440	Okay, that was lucky
9644440	9645440	because, yeah,
9645440	9647440	I only had one chance.
9647440	9648440	Can you hypnotize me
9648440	9650440	to finally stop procrastinating?
9650440	9651440	That one's out of my
9651440	9652440	experience level, chief.
9652440	9653440	I'm afraid you're on your own
9653440	9654440	for that one.
9654440	9655440	I don't...
9658440	9660440	It's happening again!
9660440	9662440	It's happening again!
9662440	9663440	It's happening again!
9666440	9667440	Oh, my lord.
9668440	9670440	Oh, my lord.
9670440	9672440	It's happening again!
9673440	9674440	It's happening again.
9674440	9675440	Okay.
9675440	9677440	We now have a panic button.
9677440	9679440	We have a panic button.
9679440	9681440	I repeat, we have a panic button.
9682440	9684440	We're going to go as far as we can.
9684440	9685440	But...
9686440	9687440	Yeah.
9688440	9689440	We've got Curse of Darkness,
9689440	9690440	which is a shame.
9693440	9694440	Um...
9694440	9695440	But we've...
9696440	9697440	Okay, okay, hold on.
9699440	9700440	Let him get up.
9700440	9702440	Can you grab that for me?
9702440	9703440	Jello, bring it...
9703440	9704440	Jello, bring it over.
9704440	9706440	Jello, bring it over.
9708440	9709440	Right.
9709440	9712440	I am going to get that key.
9712440	9713440	I'm just going to go and
9713440	9714440	explode for it.
9715440	9716440	Um...
9717440	9718440	Well, we can maybe get a chance
9718440	9719440	to get the secret room,
9719440	9721440	which is exactly what I was hoping there.
9723440	9724440	Huh?
9726440	9728440	Two back-to-back...
9728440	9729440	No, that can't be...
9730440	9733440	My code is QQ3G80R2.
9734440	9735440	We can't have both.
9735440	9736440	No, we can't.
9736440	9738440	I'm keeping the R key.
9739440	9740440	Um...
9741440	9742440	Where are you?
9742440	9743440	Large orbital, the block shot.
9743440	9745440	It splits into smaller versions.
9745440	9746440	The smaller version breaking
9746440	9747440	into blocks.
9747440	9748440	I'm just going to go and
9748440	9749440	explode for it.
9749440	9750440	It splits into smaller versions.
9750440	9751440	The smaller version breaking
9751440	9752440	into blue spiders.
9752440	9753440	Respawn.
9753440	9754440	Okay, so kind of just
9754440	9755440	spider, spider.
9755440	9756440	Rider, rider.
9756440	9757440	We're going to...
9757440	9758440	We're going to go for it.
9758440	9759440	We do have a...
9759440	9760440	We can bomb the angel.
9760440	9761440	If we get an angel,
9761440	9762440	then we can get 100% angel deals.
9762440	9763440	So we don't have to sacrifice
9763440	9765440	any health for any of those
9765440	9766440	good things.
9767440	9769440	Oh, I'm too slow for this.
9769440	9771440	I am too slow for this.
9773440	9774440	We do have a chance
9774440	9776440	for blue smoke as well,
9776440	9778440	which is good.
9779440	9782440	I'm going to pick up our weak lines.
9783440	9784440	Streamer luck.
9784440	9786440	Actual streamer luck though.
9791440	9793440	Actual streamer luck though.
9793440	9794440	I was like,
9794440	9795440	oh, I don't know if I can win this one.
9795440	9796440	Well, you know,
9796440	9798440	my confidence has gone up a little bit.
9798440	9799440	I'm not sure why.
9799440	9800440	Totally not because I've got an R key,
9800440	9802440	but streamer luck don't mean
9802440	9803440	if I do.
9803440	9804440	Okay, steady.
9804440	9806440	I really do not want to lose
9806440	9807440	my holy mantle.
9807440	9808440	Although we could just leave
9808440	9809440	the room and go again,
9809440	9810440	can't we?
9810440	9811440	Yeah,
9811440	9812440	actually,
9812440	9813440	I'm over-complicating things.
9813440	9814440	Classic women women.
9814440	9815440	Ah,
9815440	9816440	where is he?
9816440	9817440	I'm just going to let them
9817440	9818440	kind of deal with them.
9820440	9821440	Are you squidding me right now?
9821440	9822440	By the pope.
9823440	9824440	I just wanted everyone
9824440	9825440	to have a chance to
9825440	9826440	have a chance to have a chance
9826440	9827440	to have a chance
9827440	9828440	to have a chance
9828440	9829440	to have a chance
9829440	9830440	to have a chance
9830440	9831440	to have a chance
9831440	9832440	to have a chance to have a chance
9832440	9833440	to have a chance to have a chance
9833440	9834440	to have a chance
9835440	9836440	to have a chance
9836440	9837440	to have a chance
9837440	9838440	to have a chance
9838440	9839440	to have a chance
9839440	9840440	to have a chance
9840440	9841440	to have a chance
9841440	9842440	to have a chance
9842440	9843440	to have a chance
9843440	9844440	to have a chance
9844440	9845440	to have a chance
9845440	9846440	to have a chance
9846440	9847440	to have a chance
9847440	9848440	to have a chance
9848440	9849440	to have a chance
9849440	9850440	to have a chance
9850440	9851440	to have a chance
9851440	9852440	to have a chance
9852440	9853440	to have a chance
9853440	9854440	to have a chance
9857440	9859440	to have a chance
9859440	9866320	We have a pirate. They're so fast. Oh my god. I shouldn't have done that. Why did I do that?
9867520	9871920	They're so fast. I've just cornered myself.
9877440	9881200	I need to do this. Oh my gosh.
9884240	9886560	Oh my gosh. I don't know how I got away with that.
9887120	9889280	This is a scheduled and pre-recorded tip.
9891120	9895600	No, it's not. Stop it. People are gonna believe you.
9897600	9903760	Thank you Spidey for the tip. Never punish. She hates us. I don't hate you. What the heck?
9904800	9911200	I haven't said anything. Right. We've got the key. So now we have 100% angel chances, which is huge.
9911440	9917600	We got very lucky there. That could have gone really bad.
9919920	9924720	Rather fortunate. You see? Oh, we've got actual bombs this time, so we don't need to keep hurting
9924720	9935920	ourselves. Right. No point in deep poke. Wait, hold on. If I'm resetting, is there odds of me getting
9935920	9946400	like a rune like Yara or something? Huh. Self-proclaimed Dom keeps foregoing and uses the whip, honestly.
9947440	9953840	Right. Because we're gonna reset, this might be worthwhile to pick up. So I'm gonna do it
9953840	9959600	against my better judgement. Taking damage has a 50% chance to spawn something. Not necessary,
9959600	9970560	so I'm gonna just destroy this. Did you pick up that coin, but you didn't pick up the key?
9975600	9984720	I don't know. Nothing's really speaking out to me. I'm gonna just walk away and go next,
9984720	9993520	because I'm not really, not really sure, am I? One good shop is all you need to do the infinite dopes.
9995120	9996800	She loves this lovely replay.
10000000	10005840	Right, we did get the angel deal. Short speed, I'll take it. What's the card? Pickups? They're
10005840	10014240	turned into horror. Okay. Here for another NSFW concept. How about a solo audio for Patreon?
10014240	10020160	Stromi reads some of the thirsty marshmallows from Reflings and becomes overwhelmed with lust.
10020160	10026960	She can't help but to inquire reading the Maros. So Patreon don't allow live recordings,
10027840	10028880	but Twitter does.
10032080	10038720	I'm very much thinking of doing a menu, which I think you guys will approve of.
10040880	10047440	Oh wait, I'm a dumb dumb. I have fire. I can destroy these guys for free if one of them procs a fire.
10048080	10056080	Come on fire, fire, fire. Give us fire. That's just what Twitter will do when she got shy, honestly.
10057920	10067600	Twitter for the dub, yes. Don't be surprised if you see a lot of Twitter content over in August,
10067600	10074480	I will start taking it super duper serious. Wait, okay, wow. I forgot you could do that.
10074480	10082080	Right, speed. Now, normally I wouldn't waste my breath on speed, but in this occasion,
10082240	10088160	thank you for the tip again. Hey, Stronny, it's me. Type view and aim here. Just here to watch
10088160	10094640	my favorite Scottish streamer play. Insert whatever game Stronny's playing today. Good luck and enjoy
10094640	10102000	the stream. Love the content. Delete remainder of message. This is DonoScript number 39.
10102000	10107200	You know what's even worse? You trolling about with this, you creasing in your little chair. I'm
10107200	10112080	about to release a short that's like, this is how much I earn to obviously like show that like
10112080	10119200	the other, you know, something to worry about us. AI generated viewer response. Stop. And everyone's
10119200	10124560	going to be like, oh, it's an industry plan. She's like faking the numbers or whatever. No one's going
10124560	10134400	to believe me. No one's going to believe the numbers when I show them. If our 49201, thank you
10134400	10138640	for becoming a member and all the numbers out there in your name. But thanks for becoming a member.
10141600	10146080	Insert positive message here. I believe you. Stronny, you're going to have to punish chat.
10146080	10148640	Oh, well, you're getting punished because you didn't get nothing for three weeks.
10149760	10155120	How's that for punishment? Oh, dear you. Are you squiddin' me right now?
10156640	10160400	I've got to go, mum. My phone is at 5%. I'm going to miss you.
10160400	10167680	Okay. Thank you for hanging Broly legend. Rip your phone, Barry. 5%. You win as a fellow acoustic.
10167680	10175200	I believe you. I can keep for three weeks. Okay. This is the cruelest punishment imaginable.
10175200	10180000	Thank you. I can't believe I have to thank you. Thank you. Type Donator name here.
10181360	10185760	You're done. Right. I'm going to get the speed so we can actually, you know, not get wrecked and
10185840	10188800	decked. Oh, I do love a bit of Damage.
10192160	10196640	I'm going to grab a key. We are going to pick up that damage because that is well worth it.
10199680	10206160	What are you? Taking damage can make invincible. Oh, and we can huff pills if we happen to unlock
10206160	10212640	any. Good luck. Yeah, hope your cargo will not explode. Smile. We have been infiltrated
10212640	10218160	by the High Table. We need a purged room of A. Thank you. You could get a Rune Bag at some point.
10218160	10224480	That is what I'm hoping for because we're going to have a reset. I'm like, hmm.
10226720	10231360	Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Back it up, man. Even the pot of speed, I'm still slow.
10232720	10236880	I am good. That damage up is certainly going to help with our little C section, but
10237840	10245600	these guys do not care. Oh, I hate everything about those guys. Come on, buddy. Okay, thank you.
10248960	10258720	Oh, not you. Come on, haunt. Come on. I really need BFF. BFF would be so beneficial right now.
10260240	10261600	I'm going to grab these right now.
10262400	10273120	Oh, there's a ghost. I actually got him somehow. And I dodged the attack of that guy somehow.
10277680	10281120	Well, the pregnancy is more to be followed up with C set. No.
10282960	10287360	That artwork should actually be coming through soon. So that's going to be hilarious to write for.
10288240	10292000	Actually, oh, dad, I'm going to wait and record. You need to be quiet. Oh, what are you recording?
10293360	10294480	Pregnancy smart.
10296880	10299280	He's going to be like, what the fuck are the reflins in there?
10302800	10307680	He's going to wonder if these are all okay. Okay, we're going to leave the room to get Holy
10307680	10314800	Man all activated back again because we did on four. Shouldn't we just lose it there? Why are you so tiny?
10318080	10328720	Oh, I'm just spraying my little C sections because they will attach to anything they
10328720	10337840	do get hold of. So it's not like bad. Oh, there's explosions. I'm getting them reddish boys ain't
10337840	10345040	right, but perfect. Like my mom and dad knew I was a weird kid. So I'm sure they're not even
10345040	10351120	surprised about any of the shenanigans I get into these days. There's like, yeah, yeah, that's
10351120	10351840	strong. All right.
10359200	10362000	Right, we're going to leave. I'm going to pick up damage.
10364000	10366960	Health, but short speed down, but tears up.
10367760	10379680	No, we deserve better than that refling. Your C section with them having C section on their own
10379680	10384800	is horror material and play some weird stuff going on. Funny, you seem there's normal kids out there.
10387520	10390880	Oh, I have 71% chance with Anna.
10397120	10402320	There's a difference. Oh, that's hilarious. I'm telling them you said that.
10407200	10412880	We did not get your daughter pregnant. So that's amazing.
10417920	10421760	Sorry, I'm trying not to lose any health. I really don't want to lose fully mental. I think we can
10421760	10425200	get another angel deal. Praying it's a good one. Come on, give us
10428480	10434400	what is it? Or give us full. Whoa. I don't, I think haunt.
10437520	10446880	71% angel deal, by the way. 71% angel deal. You forgot the yet we didn't get your daughter pregnant
10446880	10454480	yet. Reflings, you can't say that about the convention. We're getting trouble if you skip.
10455040	10461360	I'm skipping. Give me these coins. Give me these coins.
10462480	10466800	Right, I'm going to blow up the machine because there's nothing I want in this
10467520	10475520	lot. So just blow up. Whoa. Hold on. I'll take Seraphim.
10477360	10481120	Yes. Yes, I will. Look at that. Whoa.
10484400	10486640	Wait, no one say anything about the convention.
10490400	10494160	Okay, I can't grab these coins. No, no, they have to leave.
10494160	10501040	Yeah, it's a shame that D6 is getting ignored, but it is what it is.
10501360	10505760	A little flower, a little flowery.
10513600	10517760	What are we looking at? Range, luck and a soul heart. I will absolutely take it. Are you joking?
10517760	10521920	And we could just got five cents from that fire. Not bad at all.
10522640	10530800	Are we skinny enough? Are you serious? Okay.
10532720	10539840	I need fire to burn these guys. Come on. Come on fire. Oh, and I missed. Okay. Well, I'll try.
10542480	10549440	Come on fire. Isaac got pranked. It hurts even though Archie has more value. Yes.
10550080	10552000	The reason
10557840	10562000	the stream is longer than I thought it would be. Yes, I am slightly addicted to Isaac.
10562000	10564800	My pro dad's been up for a while. I'm just getting ignored right now.
10566000	10573680	Today we're going to Bunnings, which is the equivalent of being cute. We need to hire a car.
10574480	10577760	Go do a car rental because I don't drive. I ride a bike.
10581440	10593120	Oh, come on. Bunnings is B and Q in Australia. And I'm picking up sand so my cats can shit in
10593120	10599760	a sandbox. This is true. Oh wait, we have neutral pills. Health up and another health up. I don't
10599760	10612160	know if I want too many red hearts though. Right, what are you? Sure.
10614480	10620640	The stage transition nightmare shows the wrong items in greed mode. That's hilarious.
10621360	10629600	Range and tier size. If the C-section babies are big. That's a good thing, right?
10633520	10638800	No, so thankfully Bunnings isn't too far away, but that taxi driver was,
10640160	10645840	he was on it. He must have been on the sniff or something because that was erratic driving.
10645840	10650000	That was horrible. Although I will say one thing about me. It was nice enough to stop on
10650480	10654480	the side of the road. Like we were on the fucking highway and I was like blabbering about like,
10654480	10660640	oh, I'm going to get my dad's of the airport and all that. And I was like, I'm so sorry.
10660640	10664880	I need to be sick. Can we please stop? And he stopped on the highway and you're not supposed to do that.
10669680	10673600	How would it be a traditional Scottish ride and all the reef links and kick kills?
10673600	10679520	Yes, that's when you wear kills that way. The booger sugar, that's such a good way to call it.
10679920	10684800	Tier size. I think we'll do tier size up. Why not? I don't really want anything else.
10685600	10688880	We will pick up the- Are you squidding me right now?
10690320	10695840	No wonder those cheeks be clapping like crazy. You'll be working them thighs every day on the
10695840	10703440	bike. Yeah, I ride a bike. I love my bike. I think riding bikes are cool. I may not be killed for you.
10704400	10708800	Wait, what did you say at the end? I never heard it. What did he say? What did you say?
10710480	10716560	I can't read it because I'm freaking in mid-match. I don't want to get whipped,
10716560	10720880	but I'm pretty sure that I couldn't hear the end of it because I'm freaking trying to game.
10721600	10725520	Okay, we're definitely leaving to get Holy Mantle back. I've messed up this one so badly.
10728880	10731280	Hold on. You get a spank in a minute.
10731600	10745200	Oh, jeez, Louise. Come on, haunt. Take them on, haunt. Replay the voiceler. No wonder those
10745200	10751040	cheeks be sitting on my face and letting me beat you. Wow, refling, that was so direct. I thought
10751040	10755760	you were supposed to be shy. I'm supposed to be my shy little boys, but you're not. You're feeling
10755760	10766960	it today. Oh my god. Techpoint 5? Scottish culture. Doms, fanboys. Why are there so many people
10766960	10774640	trying to make me wear a skirt? No, we don't. It's traditional. I guess meme done so much like,
10774640	10778720	oh, it's got people wearing skirt. All right, what are you going to do? Shoot yourself? Sheesh.
10784480	10793440	Oh, more damage. Yeah, we'll take it. More damage. All the damage. Right, we've got Holy Mantle back.
10797760	10802560	Oh my god. Wait, so the tears are coming from my tummy, but the shots are coming from the end
10802640	10809440	of Jell-O. That is very curious. Come on, haunt, and Jell-O.
10812240	10819840	Ow, my mantle. You suck. Give me it back. Thank you for the tip, anonymous. If I didn't say thank
10819840	10825840	you, I'm so sorry. I'm getting distracted. I, for one, accept my kill future. Strani, please
10825840	10830320	make an emote for a reflim wearing a kill. I will. Is that what you want? Because I think I have a
10830320	10835920	few more spots left. Haunt, just having them in the corner. Oh, I'm going to hurt myself by accident.
10843200	10844400	Are you serious right now?
10852800	10856080	Converse all heart containers into black hearts. Oh, sure.
10856400	10859520	Is that, then?
10862800	10871200	Getting trolled. Pretty fly. For a white guy. Yeah. If we're doing a reset,
10871200	10875360	might as well not. Well, I'll grab this pill, then. Change my mind. I want it.
10877760	10880560	Hill. Up. Getting trolled by this game.
10881040	10888000	Someone else that says damage. I think it's a gamer term. No, is it not?
10891520	10893680	Oh, I see it. A tinted rock.
10897520	10900480	Yay. I'll pop this.
10900480	10909440	Uh, right. We've got the high priestess card.
10911440	10915760	Wearing a kill means fresh air down there. No smoke path. Yeah, you're not supposed to wear underwear
10915760	10926240	with a kill. Okay, we'll play this one and then we hit reset after it. Or do we actually do the
10926240	10933600	boss fight and then hit reset? I feel like we still could have got, whoa, guppers.
10934240	10937600	Well, not quite guppers, but you know what I mean. It's collar.
10940160	10947120	Oh, you can just skip this floor? I'm not sure about that. Oh, no, there's no re-roll. I hate
10947120	10951120	when they have no re-roll. Well, we're going to blow this up anyway, so we might as well take
10951200	10958080	over to the guys and save ourselves some time trying to get that thing to pop its clogs.
10959040	10964320	Two out of three for guppers though. Bunk. Oh, under.
10969440	10977040	D20 can re-roll the... No, I don't want to. Maybe you can find two here. Well, I was just going to
10977040	10982240	reset. I don't want to buy anything on this floor, so maybe we just play it and then reset.
10985520	10992320	I was hoping to be a bit stronger in all honesty at this point, but we're not really...
10996160	11000000	Oh, no, I have Hungie. I'm a Hungie boy.
11000720	11008960	I will... Tonight, I'm having Steak, and my dad's cooking it, and he's cooking it well done,
11008960	11015040	and I will not have any slander against well-done Steaks. It's okay to be wrong sometimes,
11015040	11024000	Reeflings. It's okay to be wrong. Oh, we can actually proc all those guys for coin drops.
11024000	11029280	Purly. Thank you for becoming a member. I hope you're not Purly though. I hope you are in good
11029280	11034880	health and have long prosperity. Live long and prosper, smile. Whoa, wait, what was that? There's
11034880	11042960	something in front of me. I never even saw him. Okay, let's... Yeah, let's burn...
11046080	11054400	Yes, one more, and then we'll go out and get Holy Mantle. Come on, you want to give me the flame?
11054400	11060960	There we go. Okay, spider's lovely. Bright woman needs immediate... medium steak correction. Also,
11060960	11065040	respect for being a cyclist. I'm too scared to learn how to drive a car because I have terrible
11065040	11073360	perception, and really, I am pretty certain that I would cause a collision of some kind. I don't
11073360	11079840	know what kind. Most likely, a roundabout. Like, if I was gonna go, but the person in front of me
11079840	11086880	didn't go, I'd just, like, rear-end them a roundabout. I don't... I do not trust my perception, so...
11086880	11094880	Yeah, my next is riding a bike, but I've always rode a bike. I love my bike, and it's fun, and I
11094880	11101680	enjoy it, and I know it's kind of... I don't know, not nerdy, but, like, I know everyone kind of drives.
11103520	11109200	Okay, we're gonna take the devil's deal, and then we're gonna reset the question mark. Maybe,
11109200	11114960	I don't know. Or maybe do the fight that's below. There is a fight that's below.
11117840	11126480	Taking 15 spawns a permanent demon after 30... what? Caps up four familiars total. Should
11126480	11130080	grab it, and then, sure, just grab that. While we're at it, might as well just take everything.
11130640	11141840	All right, we do have 45 coins. Can I... please? Thank you. Thank you! Money, money, money.
11143040	11148560	I never drive. I'm too fear of it, honestly. I know, like, it's kind of one of those things where
11148560	11152560	it's like, you know what your limits are? It means, like, yeah, I do not have the perception to be able
11152560	11157440	to drive. I wonder if self-driving cars would change anything. I think you still need to be
11157440	11162240	able to actually drive, but, like, the license... go license for that. Also, thank you, Anonymous,
11162240	11168880	for asking to be my bike seat, if I didn't say thank you. In case I was too distracted.
11171280	11180480	Okay. We might be able to just straight up... oh. Okay. Thank goodness we didn't do that. We almost
11180480	11187680	skipped steam sail. All right, come on. Come on, flames, you can do it. I wish I didn't have to
11187680	11197280	drive. Cycling's so fun, because you get to appreciate the nature and so... reset now or do the fight.
11201040	11204720	Because I can always reset after the fight. Right, if I'm getting hammered in the fight,
11204720	11213840	I'll just reset if I'm getting hammered. I'll reset. I definitely could have more damage.
11217360	11218640	About 10% of the way.
11225040	11227120	I mean, because the C-section is locking.
11227120	11239440	Okay. Okay. Oh, there's a penny. You ain't mine now. I mean, 60% maybe?
11246640	11251360	Okay. What are we doing? Health? Right. I'm not giving too much health back.
11251360	11261360	All right. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Okay, 50%. We will reset. There is another round after this.
11263920	11267280	All right. I think we can get... Come on, haunt. You're doing it all, buddy.
11269360	11274480	We didn't get BFF, but we might be able to roll for it. I don't know why the flames are going in
11274480	11286320	such random direction. Gento. Okay, we did it. I'm feeling confident now. I think we did it.
11289360	11292400	I was worried we didn't actually roll. We've got it. We got it.
11293600	11299120	It's okay to be nervous and sometimes self-doubt is natural, but we got it. Oh,
11299120	11305040	God, please just perish him before all these guys come out. Okay, thank you. Okay, no flame.
11306880	11309280	No, I'm keeping my money because we're going again.
11311120	11314240	If you guys have rule plays, let me make sure to send them in Marshmallow. Yeah, yeah,
11314240	11316960	don't... Yeah, you can do it for free. Stop giving me money. What the heck?
11318720	11322320	Do it for free in Marshmallow and you can rewrite what you've already submitted. Please don't
11322880	11330000	think you're ever bothering me by like... All right, reset. Ta-da! We're all the way back here.
11330000	11333760	Yeah, please don't think you're ever annoying me in Marshmallow or anything. Don't be silly, Billy.
11335040	11339760	I'm just glad that we can talk on Marshmallow again. Nun's Habit.
11344560	11348640	Behind the key is the key and a coin. Sure, I'll take it. All right, we're gonna...
11348640	11356160	Well, there's a meme audio idea test, a self-car. Oh, right, okay.
11359120	11365440	Right. Oh, we stalk up on Hells. I think that's... We'll stalk up on Hells.
11367120	11371680	And then we'll... Oh, wait, we'll take Nun's Habit in case of something good.
11372240	11380400	Fire rate, I'll take it. Shot speed, I'll take it. Range, I'll take it.
11381920	11386880	Tears and shot speed, I'll take it. Speed? I'm actually a bit of a speedy Gonzalez.
11387760	11390000	I'll take the Trinket because we actually don't have one.
11392880	11394080	You're done. Okay.
11396880	11397840	We'll reroll.
11401920	11411280	We have two, two diamonds.
11413760	11420480	Okay. Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay. I understand what needs to be done.
11421120	11424880	I understand what needs to be done. You need not give me... It's not that, but...
11425840	11432480	Okay, I'm pretty sure I heard him or I heard a bird on the roof. It's one of the others.
11433680	11437120	Okay, I understand what I need to do and I do have the strength to do it. Thank goodness.
11439520	11446960	Or just you spin me right round, baby, right round. When you go down, when you go down.
11446960	11458720	Where's the enemy? No idea. This floor, you cook. Yes.
11461360	11466560	So we can pop one of the cards and then take the one to the next floor and...
11466560	11476960	Okay, one more.
11478800	11484720	Now we're going to avoid the El Diablo. I'm no interested. You cannot tempt me this time around.
11484720	11490960	I was desperate because... Right, so we do have to pop one card on this floor because we don't have
11490960	11496000	room for a second card, which is understandable, haven't I say? We are going to... Oh, I should have
11496000	11501760	done it on the other side, but you know what? You live in your life. So we do have to pop one,
11501760	11507360	but we can pick up the other one and then use it on the next floor. No, please don't touch that.
11509280	11514560	Thank you. Okay, and just to make sure I wasn't going crazy, doubles Isaac's number of coins.
11514560	11517680	Right, once and then we pick this up, we take it to the next floor and then we'll
11517680	11521840	double what we have on the next floor. Okay, and then we jump down.
11525520	11532960	Karaoke stream when? After three weeks, if you want karaoke, I can do a karaoke.
11533600	11544240	Okay, five bombs, sure, and I don't actually want any red health. Goodbye. Oh wait, have immaculate
11544240	11553600	conception. Oh my god, these are good. Right, don't get distracted. Let's maximise our monies
11555280	11561120	by getting these guys, sorry, my stomach just made a noise. Karaoke club. I don't think my
11561120	11573520	ping is good enough for the, right, and then fire. Come on. Fire.
11577760	11583680	Come on. Karaoke would be fun. Yes, we can definitely do karaoke. I have no problems with that.
11584400	11591120	Oh, why bombs?
11596800	11602000	This game's so, oh, I lost my holy mantle. How? I haven't even saw the dying thing.
11603120	11604800	Right, we're going to back out and go in again.
11607040	11612080	Even though I should actually try and take damage because we have immaculate conception, but
11612400	11617680	at the end of the day, at the end of the day.
11621920	11628240	Okay, okay, sorry, I'm trying not to lose anything right now. Karaoke, you have to stream, my beloved.
11632560	11640160	Okay, sure. So if I bomb him, do I get anything? I don't think so.
11642080	11652160	Hold on, I'm so sorry. My dad's literally right outside the door. Even when it's like...
11672160	11678480	I had to tell myself, fuck off. He's on the phone with my mom and I'm like, stop saying names.
11679200	11685760	Stop saying names. Pleading with him. Right, okay, what was I doing?
11689360	11692000	Ah, okay. Sorry, I couldn't hear my ingame audio there.
11692960	11702400	What have I done? What? What did I do to the game?
11711120	11712480	Why aren't bombs popping?
11712960	11724720	Oh, I was like, did I break the game? Sorry about that. I was so confused.
11724720	11728000	Okay, yeah, so if I destroy an angel now, nothing happens.
11728000	11732800	I thought I broke the game. I was like, excuse me. Now, I know there is a heart in there, but I'm not
11732800	11741760	really... I was kind of hoping for a... Oh, I can take pills. I can see forever. I'm
11741760	11745440	drowning. Is it in here? No, it's not. It's actually down below.
11750480	11756320	A womb room. If I had a donation machine, a blood donation, that probably...
11756560	11764160	Oh, I'm just going to pop it now. All right, two diamonds pop.
11767760	11770480	Yeah, something tells me we're not going to struggle in the...
11770480	11774800	Sorry, I keep forgetting. That's a delay. I'll just take it.
11775840	11784240	Right, fully recharges activated. Give me. Give me. Give me. Give me.
11785200	11788320	Give me. What's my birth rate? Familiar is that normally,
11788320	11793920	fallotain to the lilas, follow her jello instead. The melee attack gains three damage.
11793920	11797120	I'll take it. I'll take it. Don't mind if I do.
11800640	11805360	Okay, we can always see the secret room. Sure. Mother transformation.
11808480	11812000	It's not really going to do much for me, but it's only seven. BFF!
11812480	11817680	BFF! My beloved. Okay, I'm going to restock like this.
11818240	11822720	Oh wait, let's see what trinket we get. 100% wider tears and restock back. Why not?
11824800	11833520	Right, trap door can give us a new item potentially. Whipping me. Range, heart, no.
11834080	11844560	I'm going to take this. Oh, there's chaos. Do we rip on chaos? Take the range.
11846880	11852080	Wow. Do we rip on chaos? Well, we can't grab that almond milk.
11855120	11858720	It's damage with C-section, is it? Oh, because of the whipping.
11859680	11864560	Oh, we got a paternal heart for it. I'll stop at you.
11869200	11871600	I'm starting to think you guys are in a fendom at this rate.
11873360	11881760	Thank you. I can't believe I have to say this. Thank you. Viewbot number 5109172 for the donation.
11881760	11891440	You're ridiculous. Thank you. Okay, wow. Jello's so big. Oh my god, look how wide they look like.
11892720	11900800	Right, well, we do chaos. As if yes or she wasn't any indication. Right, we've done chaos.
11902320	11903360	Number of bombs, sure.
11903680	11910960	Two of clubs. The two of clubs. Shot speed, no. Let's refresh.
11913840	11919280	Bouncy tears, absolutely. Where are you? Cage leaps on an enemy that deals the first
11919280	11925440	damage to Isaac, deals 90 damage and releases four rock, chases enemies for 13 contact damage, sure.
11926400	11930720	Spider baby, sure. I'll take it.
11931760	11938240	Flight, sure. I'll take it. I'm spending all that money. Petrifying tears, sure. I'll take it.
11938240	11939520	You don't have to tell me twice.
11941760	11945040	Angry fly for Beelzebub, sure. I'll take it.
11946000	11948400	A shield, sure. I'll take it.
11949440	11951920	Bloody guts, sure. I'll take it.
11952720	11957360	Gumpers, my beloved. I know I don't need it, but I'll take it.
11963040	11967200	Okay, sure. We'll take it. Oh no, we can't afford jiddy. My shadow, not jiddy.
11976000	11979360	Wait a minute, Jello can move this out the way. Come on, Jello.
11980480	11984480	Move out of the way for me. Yeah, I'm so smart. Oh my gosh.
11985920	11993200	I'm so smart. Why am I so smart? Oh my, whoa. Oh, I thought that was an enemy coming at me.
11993200	11996720	It's my own thing. Okay, let's do this.
11997440	12006240	Take almond milk. Can I reach it? I don't think I can take the thing.
12009600	12017120	Yeah, you need that thing, that puppet thing to get access to this one. It's a troll. We are being
12017120	12021920	filled. We are being made of full of ourselves. You need the jump book. You're flying. Wait,
12021920	12027040	what do you mean I'm flying? Yeah, I can't get in.
12030000	12036480	That's what Reefling said, I can't get in. Just use the back door. Right, if we do this,
12036480	12043840	it turns everything in here into a bomb. Something exploded over there.
12043840	12051200	Uh, don't need that. Don't need the bomb. So we'll just nuke this.
12052640	12060080	Get some pennies back, and then dead eye. Why not? Why not? I will take dead eye.
12061040	12065120	Okay, let's go. I'll just make sure I picked up everything.
12066960	12071440	Well, Maze will take that now. It doesn't really make much of a difference. Let's go.
12074720	12077520	No, you can only get it with the jump book pretty funny.
12078560	12081760	No, you can get it with that Muppet thingy, you know. I'm going crazy. Can't get in,
12081760	12085680	because I'm too big. Real entrance.
12092560	12100960	Hello? Are we about to go crazy? Right, I'm going to purposely get
12101680	12109120	energy on my dick, so I can dig your hole. All right, money for money. Oh wait, I have flight,
12109120	12114560	idiot. I'm going to pick up that box, because that's like the most OP thing I could possibly do at
12114560	12124720	this. Look at all the babies. I can't see anything. Uh, right, we're going to purposefully get...
12125680	12132480	Ah, sure, I'll take that. You're already crazy. This is overkill. I'm going to imagine if my game
12132480	12139920	got corrupted, because, uh, not corrupted. Bruh! Bruh, it's so bright in here. Hold on,
12139920	12146640	let me put reactive mode on, just so you know how is it going to go on. Is that reactive mode?
12147040	12151040	Yeah, that's how red is.
12158400	12166480	I have no idea what that did. Well, I'm going to do my wee staircase, and then I'm going to go down here.
12166480	12170560	Did I really help them with the visuals? Pretty, like, oh, we've got black mark!
12171680	12175040	Oh, I don't know if it's the one that doesn't let you progress. Like, some of them don't let
12175040	12181360	you go backwards, so hold on. Hold on, I am going to take this. I don't want to miss it.
12182240	12190000	Wouldn't miss it for the world, wefin. And then, we're just doing this. Oh, we've got perfection
12190000	12195040	unlocked! Oh, we can pick it up, actually, because we've got, um, I can't see shit.
12196960	12201840	Stop giving me devil deals, or you will pay for your crimes.
12205200	12211200	Roon shard! Oh, I've opened up a wimmy. Okay, we can't do anything, but we are going to go down
12211200	12220320	to the secret lair. Hopefully, we do get a Yara. No, not, oh wait, no, there is something here.
12223040	12230080	I hate the game going up where OP is. Um, it's going real good.
12230880	12233760	We're actually going to take this to add to our damage.
12234720	12241600	The black rune will consume it, so boom. And we got nothing we wanted. That's okay!
12242640	12251120	Right, I'm not health, fiery, range. There's no downside to you, I will take you.
12252000	12259360	Okay, let's go. What runes do you have unlocked? Not many. Yara was actually, oh, it's an error
12259360	12268400	room. Well, thank goodness I didn't go ahead. It's in here. Oh, there's a chest on him. Okay,
12268400	12278000	I'll blow him up. Picking up a coin has 21st chance to spawn a red heart. Well, I don't need
12278000	12281680	it, sweetie. And here you thought you weren't going to finish the run. Literally, I thought I
12281680	12291600	wasn't going to win, but we winning. We win, aim. Is she becoming on in 30 minutes? Or did I make?
12299920	12311120	Are you serious? I love chaos. I love chaos. I love chaos. 40 minutes until the collab. Okay,
12311120	12314880	I will redirect into sheepsters because I always seem to miss her, so I
12318080	12326000	I literally chaos deniers and shambles. And I get the Seraphim unlock. I know I already have
12326000	12335280	flight at the moment, but you know, Seraphim is nice. 23 damage. Oh, and a boss room little
12335280	12343360	cheeky man. Oh, look how big the babies are. They're humongous. They're a baby. Oh, wait,
12343360	12354000	I'm dumb dumb. Here. No, no, no, no. I don't want to skip. Okay, let's go. Whoa. What are you?
12354560	12365440	No, not Levitical. Levitical sucks. Okay, I see sack. Guppy's head. Wait,
12365440	12371920	I already have guppy? Oh yeah, I do because look how much buzzing around. Right, spawns a sack.
12371920	12377840	Every six rooms. That sounds good to me. Beelzebub transformation.
12377920	12387840	Not bad. Okay, let's blame him. I missed those things. Okay, hold on to her money.
12387840	12394480	We might get Yiera, which is in the room. Wait, if I pop my ult, I've popped it twice.
12395120	12397600	Oh my god, this is insane.
12398560	12402720	Bro, they can't even spawn in.
12405360	12411760	I can't even see. I don't. I don't want to pick up the coins in case I've got a Yiera.
12412480	12415760	I don't seem to have a Yiera. I don't seem to have half rooms at the moment.
12419600	12426400	Bro, I love this game. See, this is when the game's satisfying and you don't want to like
12426400	12430080	nuke it into the stratosphere is when you're like winning really easily. I said what I said.
12432720	12437920	Empty vessel. When Isaac has no red hearts, you get flight and you actually get a proc.
12437920	12444480	Aw, that's a shame that I've got so much. So, does you drop a pedestal item now because I have
12444480	12447520	chaos? No, you don't. Curious.
12450720	12452720	How did that black room get taken out of my hand?
12453680	12457440	Look how fast I have to charge it again. Barely took two seconds, honestly.
12457440	12461120	Right. No, I didn't drop a Yiera, but I'll do this one off.
12463760	12468000	I don't know what it does. Sometimes it doesn't even say out loud what it's doing and I'm like,
12468000	12473600	um, okay, that didn't help me at all. I am so small I can hardly pick up the coins properly.
12474560	12480640	Right. Uh, because nothing in here. Was there anything worth?
12485920	12490880	Every time we purchase something, we might get 0.5 damage.
12492720	12498400	Chaos deniers in shambles. Shambles.
12499360	12503600	Oh, and we've got money back, bro. Money back guarantee.
12505360	12510720	Oh, we can actually get rid of Levitical. We've got range for that, I'll take it.
12511600	12516560	Cause it's a chance to shoot. Yeah, we're gonna grab it and we're gonna be even more OP.
12517120	12523760	This is getting, this is getting a bit silly in that. Oh my god, hungry soul. I'll take Bob. No.
12524400	12526880	Well, we can actually get Bob Transformation if we want to.
12527360	12533680	Blood Poppy chases enemies. No, he's cute, but he's dangerous. He'll attack you if you're not careful.
12534560	12540800	It doesn't mean it. He just gets a little excited. Taking damage shoots, uh, sure.
12542080	12546480	So if we do end up taking damage, they're getting annihilated on site. They don't even have a choice
12546480	12551520	in the matter. Uh, Papa Fly. Chance Lock, yeah.
12553040	12559600	For, for $7 we can get 25 coins, sorry, 7 cent we can get. What's this?
12560160	12564000	I agreed. Every 20 seconds, Isaac shoots a coin tier that deals...
12565280	12567920	Oh no, I cost a coin to shoot. No, thank you.
12570160	12574720	What a deal. Literally, what a nice shop. I like the economy in Isaac's world.
12575600	12581920	You can break it so easily. A Rift? I actually think Rifts will be more dangerous because of our C-section.
12583600	12592000	Uh, we've got Book of Sin. Spawn's Barriers, no. We might try and go for Bookworm just because we can.
12593520	12599920	We don't need bombs. We don't need lunch. We can do it again. Maybe we'll bomb it just to re-roll it for free.
12599920	12610560	Polyphemus? Oh, I'm gonna cream. Oh, and we've got that as well. I'm creaming.
12610560	12618720	That's a shame we couldn't get that, but I'd rather take the thingy. Polyphemus. You just need Keeper's
12618720	12628960	head. 76 damage. Look at them all coming out. Brav. This is getting outrageous. This run. This is
12628960	12638080	outrageous. Oh no, the cloud. It said AFU to us. What, stinky cloud? 76 damage. Feels good, man.
12638160	12650160	That's a wee rune. I need to find out. Okay, I didn't do anything. Sure, let's bomb this.
12652480	12659440	What did you drop? More bombs. Okay. Sorry for the brightness. I'm trying to burn the Keeper's over
12659440	12665840	here. Man, I can't see. I need to leave. Sorry. I literally cannot see. What's going on? Right.
12665840	12674560	You. I've been needing you because... Oh no, I need... Oh, well, sure.
12679600	12687440	It's fine. You're allowed to do that. I can't see a thing, honestly. The flashbang in.
12687440	12691520	It's pretty severe after I've met, even by my standards. I'm like, sirion.
12692320	12700640	We got baby spin for all our familiars. They're actually gonna have accuracy, you know?
12702960	12704400	Oh, what are you giving us? Pills?
12707200	12710560	Wheel of Fortune? Yeah.
12710720	12716640	Is that what I just did? Is that a passive?
12717920	12722000	Luck up, sure. Hyrofan, sure.
12723920	12734000	Pretty fly. High Priestess. Okay, that was a lot. We're not doing that one. That one's rubbish.
12734720	12742960	Hopefully we'll get a Yara. What now, though? Bingeater. Oh, I like poison tears. I think poison
12742960	12754560	tears is the way to do it. Oh my god. I know I'm full, but... No, we don't actually need that.
12755520	12760000	I don't even know why I'm, like, trying to stretch your size with game. I mean, look,
12760000	12762800	we're not even a cheat. Like, this game's gonna break.
12767120	12772960	I can't even see. Oh, there's a Yara. I repeat, there is a Yara.
12774480	12779200	Is there another Yara? Imagine if we drop two Yaras. No, no, no, no, no. I don't want the coins
12779280	12790960	coming over to me. Nope, nope, nope, nope, nope. Nope. Okay, we've got Yara. Let's pop it.
12794960	12803040	Was there a second Yara? Nah. Draft. Okay, but we got the coins. That's the main thing.
12803920	12805200	We got our second Yara.
12809840	12813200	Okay, you know what? We'll just go for the devil. There's so much health in this.
12813200	12815840	Oh, I forgot we were not doing...
12818160	12821520	I'll take it for the bookworm transformation, but I'm not gonna leave with it.
12822960	12826960	What does it do? It gives a soul heart. Not sure. Give me up then. Pop it.
12827360	12830160	Oh, thank you.
12832480	12834240	I could have saved it for the next floor.
12837120	12838160	What'd you mean, the night?
12840400	12841520	Saved what, Monkos?
12843200	12847520	What did I misunderstand? I misunderstood. It does not compute. I suck.
12848400	12850960	Right, we'll do poison tier. I'm actually not that fussed for...
12851920	12856320	What's it called?
12857520	12860960	Benjyter, just because it cycles through everything and I'm really dumb.
12862480	12868320	Using a rune has a tip to spawn a copy. Oh, that's worth it. That's so worth it.
12869760	12876480	Okay, the 50% wider is worth it as well. I know I'm down to three luck, but we're doing so much
12876480	12882000	damage. I'm not fussed for Benjyter. I know it's good, but...
12884960	12887440	Do you need to save at this point? Probably not.
12887440	12889760	Tears up. Oh no, tears are capped, aren't they?
12890960	12899040	Thothic! Thothic. I got Thothic about damage and health. Conjoined, why not?
12899600	12904400	Enemies explode into tears. Isaac's tears are connected with a beam of electricity.
12907600	12912400	It's a good day to be an Isaac player. It's a fantastic day to be an Isaac player.
12912400	12914480	Damage, just whole straight up damage.
12916720	12919520	Oh, it's a good day. Right, we're gonna bomb you too.
12922400	12926240	Thank you. What does the cookie do again?
12926240	12928480	Each of Isaac's tears have a different stars effect.
12930160	12933440	We're gonna get the Christmas box in here. Oh, wait.
12936160	12938960	I've got lump of coal, I'm guessing. It doesn't work.
12939840	12943600	We'll grab it, honestly. We'll just spend everything. Spend them all.
12945200	12949840	We're melting the PC today. If us, where if this game breaks right at the end?
12949840	12953520	I'll be region. We're literally one away from the boss fight.
12954080	12959680	Play the cookie, it's fun. Yes. One here.
12962480	12967520	Sure, give me an internal heart. Okay, bomb, so it's fine.
12969680	12973760	What are we looking at? Oh, well, we can actually get a devil horseman.
12974720	12977440	Oh, no, the fire thing isn't broken. Hold on.
12979360	12983120	Okay, I think it's propped. Is there one over here? I have no idea. Hold on.
12984000	12987840	Oh, that's a... We'll grab the seven seals, why not?
12989120	12992640	I don't think we actually have to play anymore, if I'm being honest.
12993200	12995680	I think we got Yara instantly.
13001840	13002880	I got a green shark.
13006480	13010800	I can't see. There is a Yara. I'm gonna pick it up.
13011760	13013440	So it's already in my persons.
13019680	13022320	Okay, okay. One more time.
13024720	13027840	I didn't even... I didn't even need to do a new shoot.
13027840	13031280	Yeah, I'm gonna pop the Yara, so it'll be a surprise if there's a Yara up there or not.
13032400	13035360	Well, that's so good. Thank you for that. Please don't waste my time ever again.
13037520	13039520	What enemies literally cannot see them?
13041680	13042480	Okay, we got him.
13043920	13045680	Good thing. Maybe.
13047520	13048400	What did that do?
13050400	13053280	Yeah, it does not do anything. Rune shard.
13053280	13057600	Okay, let's just grab all this money, spend it, and you.
13057600	13062000	Because this was like the best run I could have ever asked for.
13062000	13066800	Literally a reset key. Special shout out to reset key. You did it.
13067520	13072240	I'm gonna try and... actually, you know what? I have 30 bombs. I think I'll be okay.
13073360	13076880	I'll just spawn them. Spawns a random coin.
13076880	13081680	Imagine if we got Lilith giving birth to babies, literally.
13082400	13084640	She's raising the population by herself.
13090160	13093200	A whip. No, I want this one.
13094160	13097040	Could you imagine if that Yara duplicated though?
13098080	13099920	Could you imagine if it did though?
13102240	13106560	The high priestess. I got a drowsy repeatedly. Oh, thanks, I guess. Drowsy.
13108160	13112640	Okay, let's see what we can buy. Oh, no point in the coin thing.
13112880	13122080	We've got a quick worm. Not bad.
13123440	13127280	Could just go with familiars, to be honest, because we're about to double the familiars.
13128240	13133360	Levity in front of Isaac deals... what, ill damage?
13133360	13136240	Jeez, sure. Give me that. I don't recognize it.
13136880	13139760	Spectral tears. I think my tears already capped long ago.
13139840	13142880	Picking up 15 hearts, yeah. Go for it.
13144960	13147760	We'll reroll a little cheeky reroll. Actually, we're just gonna bomb for it,
13147760	13150800	because we've not got that much money. Three hell.
13151760	13155920	Sure, why not? Just give us everything, okay?
13155920	13158400	Whoa, what do you get? A chest gives you one coin.
13159120	13162880	It's a bit late for that, I think. We could maybe bomb these.
13163040	13168000	Okay, uh, I'm gonna bomb too.
13169600	13174320	Okay. Well, something tells me we're ready for this greed fight.
13174320	13178720	You know, I'm not too sure we've got it in the bag, but why not? Let's see, one coin.
13183280	13183600	Okay.
13186480	13190800	Oh, that was a tough one. That was scary. Not gonna lie, I was on the edge of my seat.
13192960	13198560	Okay, let's at least get some money to donate to them. Okay, here it goes.
13202160	13203680	Oh, for goodness sake.
13205920	13208080	Could you imagine this is greedier of always?
13210720	13213200	Sure, I will put money in the greed mission.
13214160	13224160	I'm ridiculous. Let's pop these. Maybe we can get a few coins to put in the machine.
13226080	13227440	That was crazy.
13230560	13232720	Oh, we got a few more coins to put in. That wasn't bad.
13237120	13240800	That was so close. I know we almost didn't make it.
13241760	13247920	But yeah, that's Lilith on greed mode. As you can see, she's OPE, the Binding of Bosses easy game.
13248560	13252640	It just depends. Sometimes you can get the best run and it makes you addicted to the game,
13252640	13256400	and sometimes you can get work, but like terrible run after terrible run,
13256400	13260480	and it makes you so upset you literally are like, had enough.
13263200	13267600	So if I minutes until the collab. Okay, I will do marshmallows,
13268560	13272720	and I will make sure I'm redirecting into Sheepster's. She is broken in general.
13272720	13278000	Try her if you want an easy run. Does donate and even do anything after the first time?
13278000	13281440	No, it doesn't, but I just do it because, because why not?
13281440	13286480	But yeah, that's my save file on Isaac. So this game becomes multiplayer in November,
13286480	13294000	which is when you guys are going to come in, because yeah, I haven't gotten all the unlocks.
13294960	13301360	Um, I still don't even comprehend how some of the characters work, like, um.
13304880	13309280	Who's that? Bethany? I always struggle to understand what she's doing.
13309280	13314080	Shawnee's going to carry us in this game. I know for once I get to carry you, maybe, I'm not sure.
13315200	13319200	I'm not, I guess I could start playing. No, it's very, if it's not the game for you,
13319200	13324640	do not force it. I am so serious when I say that. Bethany is really strong in the city.
13324640	13329360	I just want the game to play with you. Oh no! You need to make sure you actually like the game.
13329360	13336480	It's not an easy game. So that, those symbols on the left side are like the unlocks of certain bosses
13336480	13342880	that have killed, and like, I'm missing a lot. Like, the tattered page means I've done delirium
13342880	13347600	and all of that, and most of these are like super lucky runs. I don't really get good.
13348560	13352800	There needs to be a mod where the familiars are replaced by rooflings. I would be so down.
13352800	13358880	I finished Tainted Lost, then we've go, brev, brev. I've not even started on Tainted Lost.
13359440	13365520	I'm too, like, this is how the average Tainted Lost run goes. Are you ready?
13366960	13371120	So we, we have a holy card. We can pop it, so we're now one shot death.
13372080	13379840	Like, this is, we're not going to make it. Yeah, we've got a sacrifice room that we can't
13379840	13385600	do anything, and before it finishes the run, no chance. I have attempted so many times and I just get,
13387440	13390480	like, literally we're down, we don't have another holy mantle.
13392480	13400080	Or, I've already messed up. Okay, we're not fighting those spiders. Like, this is how bad it is.
13401920	13406160	Tainted, Tainted is just, like, such a un,
13408080	13412720	unfun experience. Now, I'm sure it's fun when you actually, oh,
13415600	13421680	okay, well, right, let's try again. Let me just try and explain again how bad this is.
13421680	13426080	Okay, we're going to pop the holy card, and then we're going to, you know, just flutter about,
13426080	13432320	get a few things going on. And we're just going to check out the shop, okay. Mm-hmm, close enough.
13434640	13440880	Yeah, like, eternal hearts mean nothing, so, yeah. Strony is locking it. No, it's not happening.
13440880	13445600	I basically, in order to even get anywhere, I would need to roll,
13449040	13452800	maybe a spoon bender. I'd need to roll that first.
13453200	13459680	Now, the only thing is, we do have spectral tears, which means we can shoot through rocks,
13459680	13463200	like that, which is obviously a bit much, much, mutual helpful.
13465360	13472560	But no, I have never successfully done this. I remember when we both came out and people had
13472560	13479840	to date, I mean, how to get the lost, honestly. Some of the requirements in this game are like,
13479840	13489120	right there. But yeah, I basically would need, like, the most OP items ever. Now,
13489120	13495760	the tainted lost apparently comes with better items. Do we believe that? Let's find out what this
13495760	13510480	better item is, hmm? Oh, what? Hold on. Hold on. The one item I need. The one item I need. Hold
13510480	13518240	on. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. The one item I need in order to do this
13518240	13528960	game mode. The one item I need in order to do this game mode is the sign. It's the sign. It's
13528960	13532960	the sign. It's the sign. It's the sign. Right, don't mess up. Don't mess up. Don't mess up. Don't mess
13532960	13542800	up. I don't want to mess up, but those strays from the flies are very dangerous, as well as his
13542800	13551040	triple shot. Hmm, not a fan. Oh my god, we have an orbital. We're so safe. Let's go.
13553760	13559520	Focus. This run is real. Better items means you can't find useless items and gives health and
13559520	13568480	weight. Okay, now I can take a devil deal. That's not a problem. So I actually misplayed there. I
13568480	13574240	could have killed all these guys without them getting close to me like this. But we can hover on
13574240	13579920	the rocks safely and I'm taking it. I don't care. You should boost the fight, strongy. No, I don't
13579920	13585680	care. I'm literally tainted gloss. Leave me alone. I'm just going to blow it up because it's a health
13585680	13590080	hazard, okay? Okay, this room's a bit of a hazard. I'm pretty sure they have spectral shots. Do they
13590080	13598560	not? Well, they can come on the rocks. So, not the best room, but we're alive. Oh, we need a key.
13603120	13611120	Okay, a key. Our coins. Coins are a key. No one destroyed, strongy. I also can't find defense,
13611120	13617520	like most orbitals, cuba, meat, bandage, or exception. Yeah, nod leaf is taken out of the item
13617520	13624320	pool. If I had nod leaf, the only reason I've done stuff on the other tainted, the lost in general,
13625200	13629600	but nod leaf is taken out of the item pool for tainted. And I'm like, ah, great. The only thing
13629600	13637120	that is keeping me alive during all my runs. Nod leaf is the MVP for me personally. Okay, I have a
13637120	13648960	key. I'm actually going to regret this if it's not got a key and it doesn't have a key. Key!
13652720	13653840	That might have been wiser.
13657120	13664000	We're going to have to sadly skip our item room, it appears, but we got a second
13664000	13671920	lifeline with holy mantle. That is an unfortunate pill to swallow. Maybe I can get a key out of
13671920	13683040	any, a key, a coin out, oh, there we go. We are going to pick up phd, so it means we can swallow pills.
13684800	13693440	Something's wrong. Okay, now you have to play it. I'm not, I don't know. Okay, okay, okay.
13693520	13707600	Hopefully this is, this. Okay, it looked like a secret. Oh, what? What? Right.
13711200	13715440	That's why I didn't want to happen. And there's a secret room!
13715840	13728320	Oh, I'm so scared. Oh my god. Oh my god, is this the run?
13732160	13733200	Is this the run?
13733920	13748000	Is this the run? We got blank card on tainted lost with holy card in our freaking holster.
13750160	13754560	Oh, please don't fuck it up. I'm going to be so sad. I'm going to be so sad if I fuck this up.
13754560	13766560	I'm going to camp on the rock. I know. Okay, we can, we can take a devil deal. It's fine.
13769600	13777440	Curious. Oh no, it's goat head. My apologies, it's goat head. Absolutely, absolutely on goat
13777840	13779600	head. Okay, so we can choose now.
13785680	13792960	Okay, I am so scared. The code, papa, vector, hotel, foxtrot,
13793520	13805760	New Guinea. What's it? November, echo, wanker, November. I hardly even know.
13807680	13813920	I am so scared to progress. I don't not want to lose this run. I feel like I'm going to be dumb
13813920	13821360	and use the card or something. Can, holy mantles can't stack, can they? I can't stack this holy
13821360	13830400	mantle card. I've never had the combo before. Okay, sorry. They can't stack. Okay.
13832800	13837360	Sorry, I just got a little nervous. Sorry. I lost my cool a little bit.
13841520	13848720	Okay. Okay, now I just need some good combos to put my damage up so I can one shot stuff as soon
13848720	13853680	as I enter the room. Is that too much to ask for? To one shot stuff, huh?
13855280	13862000	Not this room, not this room. It's so small. Okay. Okay, hold it. Cards can't stack, but
13863520	13876320	consider this. I am MLG pro. Shot speed up. Okay. Okay. I'm analising the contents, not really
13876320	13884320	speaking to me. I don't know where to go. I feel it. Yeah, I was going to say, I feel like this is
13884320	13894400	the way to the boss. Okay, easy, easy. Take out any. It's not small. It's just cool. You lost your
13894400	13902960	cool. I lost my cool. Oh, wait, shit. Oh, my soundboard isn't up. Right. Sorry. I need to try
13902960	13911280	hard. Forget the soundboard. This might actually be the run. This might actually be the run. I'm just
13911280	13916960	from afar, nice and safe. If I could get contact to protect me.
13916960	13927440	Ah, right, okay. Okay, okay. What's in here?
13929280	13937280	Moves along. Enemies are attracted to the fly. Okay, this is good. Oh, that's why it's called
13937280	13941520	lost fly because it takes away the attention from lost. I know there's a tinted rock here,
13942240	13949040	but we don't take any so hard. I don't think we're going to raid Toshiba on time. Oh, no.
13950480	13956400	Don't the whole point. Oh, don't thank you. Right, okay. Let me get up, let me get up.
13956400	13959440	Nice and steady. Use her.
13959440	13971120	Well, we just turned back into the boss. I don't know. These spectral tears are so good early on.
13978000	13984240	Okay, he's attacking him, so I'll do that. No, no.
13985200	13990160	We're not. Key. I was too late for that on the other side of the map now.
13991920	13996960	Right, holy car, do not dare use right bumper or I will eat your face.
13998800	14003280	Okay, well, I was a waste. Don't do that again. I believe Mercy is going to be the one responsible
14003280	14007360	for the POV. Okay, okay, okay. Okay, okay, okay.
14007360	14016240	Okay, I can do this. Well, the odds of the secret room being right here are pretty high.
14017760	14021680	Yeah, what we got? Rubbage, right.
14025600	14027920	Oh, no, I'm not getting an item.
14030560	14034960	Unless it, well, if it's another, oh, he's attacking the fly. Thank goodness.
14035360	14041440	Okay, 50%. He might, yeah, I was going to say he might swap the flies out of range now.
14044960	14048720	Yep, that's okay. Perfect will.
14050800	14058480	Cube and meat. Lamal. Cube and meat. We take perfection. I mean, we can fly over to items.
14065600	14072720	Well, sure. And pop it. Well, there's no point in popping it, but we could maybe get
14072720	14080400	bookworm or whatever it's called. Oh, stress, stress, stress, stress.
14082560	14088880	They are making Shrek 5. Better not. Thank you, but meat. Well, if it turned into meat boy,
14088880	14093840	meat boy goes away and attacks, which wouldn't go amiss.
14098640	14099440	Why are you a patch?
14105760	14109360	Okay, these are the diagonal guys, so we're just going to stay nice and steady.
14109360	14119920	Breathe and hydrate, bro, honestly. I'm so stressed right now. My blood pressures through
14119920	14125760	the roof. My ears must be red from how stressed I am right now. Okay, we've got lucky penny,
14125760	14131040	so if we pick up any kind of staticy effect, as long as we don't get walloped,
14132640	14134880	I couldn't have made that closer if I desired.
14135840	14142240	I couldn't have made that any closer if I had the desire to. I would like to find the shop, please.
14142800	14148240	No. Let's go to this one for that. He can't come over yet.
14152160	14153120	Oh, I do have a key.
14156160	14162240	Yeah, 11% luck. I'm going to need you to start dropping pickups because I'm starting to not
14162240	14172400	think it's 11% luck. I need range as well. I need to be able to safely attack from like halfway
14172400	14183520	across the room. A bomb? A bomb's not key though. Can you say key? Right, I'm going to push them
14183520	14188000	into the fly on purpose. I could have easily gotten hit by that. I'm not going to lie.
14188240	14198320	Okay, he's rejecting key. Right, I'm not laughing anymore video game. I'm getting stressed.
14200000	14205200	I'm getting stressed. Okay, we have a key. It's a golden one, so we don't have to sacrifice any key we obtain.
14209760	14216960	Why is this map so long? I almost just backed into that. I almost just backed into that. I'm
14216960	14227040	not even kidding. Oh, I saw it. The pointy rock in the corner. I am playing so safe. You have no idea.
14229200	14232880	I'm trying to range up the exact thing I needed. Hallelujah.
14234800	14236800	The game may sometimes deliver.
14238560	14245200	Automatically charges and fully charges the active item. Okay, I'll just pick it up now.
14246960	14254960	So we can get it even more common. Yeah, this is definitely a bomb run and not any other kind of run.
14258080	14262480	I'm stressed. The blood, if I had a heart rate monitor on right now, it is not going to blow
14262480	14267840	on 120. Right, we're going to turn back and we're going to go to the item room.
14268240	14272880	I love how you can actually do it in pencil. It's so much
14273920	14282880	big. Just ask Johnny. It seems like, how about work? Fly is putting in work. The fly is taking
14282880	14290000	all of the aggro when we enter a room, which is really, you know, that's such a shame. Yeah,
14290000	14296560	the game is like, oh yeah, you get good items. The items in the game. Butt bombs, top blasts.
14296560	14303600	Okay, thanks, I guess. That's just an average day for me, if I'm being honest. Butt bombs.
14306800	14312320	I love how this began as a demonstration of why lost runs are so hard and then you get a god run.
14313600	14317280	The pressure is getting worse, so I feel like I'm going to mess it up really badly,
14317280	14323280	which is a shame, but it's kind of on par for me. So I wouldn't be too surprised.
14326800	14332640	Wouldn't be surprised at all. Oh, I don't like that. I don't like that. Thank goodness that
14332640	14347280	fly took the aggro for those spaky guys. Wow. Breathe. I'm so scared.
14347440	14356880	I'm going to be sick. I'm actually going to be sick in this run.
14360080	14363600	A quarter or a backstab. I'm going to go with a backstab.
14367600	14373840	Oh, I'm so stressed. What other items do you need? Everything. Just everything.
14374480	14377200	We're on floor five. One more and then we do mam.
14380160	14384320	Curse of the blinds. So we don't know what item we're going to pick up, but thankfully
14386320	14392560	I made it home. You're alive. You didn't die. Thank you for the tip, Rolly legends.
14395200	14402640	Oh, not good, not good, not good, not good. I am so lucky I held back those bullets there.
14404400	14410000	Come on. Come on, just die. You're not even a champion.
14414320	14417200	I feel sick to my stomach from worry.
14420880	14426160	Everyone wants a gamer girlfriend until she throws up on Isaac because she's got a really good last run.
14427520	14431120	Okay, we're going to get money from this fight. We know that there's not a greed's fight in the
14431120	14438720	shop, so it is worth her here. Oh, my stomach is actually twisting and nervousness. Bro, calm down,
14438720	14443520	relax. It's just a video game. If it's just a video game, then why does it make me so happy? Win, win.
14446160	14449360	Her palms are swayed. They are freaking, oh, we got another range.
14451280	14459040	Oh, this cannot be true. And yet it is my eye. Oh, it's the jumpy ones. It's the ones I don't like.
14459600	14462400	They've got blood on their front. That means they're a jumpy one.
14464720	14467920	Okay, okay, that's fine.
14470480	14473440	Oh, my, I'm not kidding. My guts are genuinely twisting, bro.
14476880	14481840	Okay, take your time. Take your, use your, you can
14482400	14491840	know again, Hunter. I kind of still want perfection. Whoa, we got planetarium. No way.
14499360	14505360	If I lose, you have to comfort me unironically, Ruth, and that's so mean. Putting that pressure
14505360	14510880	on me. We got planetarium. Please be political or like something or Venus or take Venus.
14512160	14522400	Oh, God. Mars. What does Mars do? I don't know what Mars does. I've never had it before. What does
14522400	14531760	Mars do? GG run. Wait, why? What does it do? Double tap the move button.
14532160	14544480	This is getting wet. What? Double tap the move button.
14546800	14553120	Nothing's happening. Mars is bad. Of course, I get the only one thing that's bad.
14555520	14557680	Double tap, move in the same direction.
14557680	14566640	What? I have a ram. I have a ram. What's wrong with ram? Am I going crazy?
14568320	14571920	Okay, we're better chests. I'll take it. Wait, what's the
14573440	14576720	one point? It lets you dash, but it works weird.
14580480	14582720	Oh, that's so lucky to fly, honestly.
14583600	14590640	Short speed. Flight for the room. No, we need holy mantle. Don't tempt me.
14591360	14593600	We already have flight. We're the loss.
14598880	14602800	And before I die via mimic chest, I wouldn't put that past me.
14605280	14606240	Okay, that's fine.
14606720	14614240	Well, we have mum's keys. We actually don't need that.
14616080	14621040	Oh, no. These guys will charge across the map. I am letting distance do the rest.
14622720	14627600	You can use it to go in the curse room. I am not risking like that. I am not good enough for that.
14627600	14632880	Right, we've got the planetarium. We've got everything along the way. Okay.
14633600	14636080	Monster 2.0.
14641840	14647920	I don't like it. Okay, he's focusing on the fly, though. I'll take it. If you want to charge the
14647920	14653920	fly, I was going to keep up with the fly. Oh, this is fantastic for aggro.
14654000	14660160	Oh, this is fantastic. Oh, farted, sorry. Excuse me.
14663200	14666640	We need to get poisoned. They got poisoned by Mayukas. Mayukas.
14668320	14670960	Buy a bow here, ladies and gentlemen. Buy a bow here.
14671840	14673680	Oh, right, aggro. He's got aggro.
14674720	14678080	Well, okay, I understand the problem now with Mars.
14678480	14682400	I did not do that. I understand the problem with Mars.
14683920	14688080	I understand the problem with Mars. I don't know what it is, but I'm taking it. It's free.
14688080	14694160	Okay, we've got a guppy's hairball, sure. Mars is very bad. I agree. I agree, I agree, I agree.
14697040	14700560	Lost fly is good. Right, we're doing the first mum fight.
14701520	14703760	It's like we have hardly any damage.
14711920	14712560	Someone.
14717200	14723760	All right, no mimic chest. What was that? Short speed? That looks like it.
14727920	14728880	Take your time.
14731440	14734480	Oh, that's in here.
14737840	14740720	Oh, that's kind of worth it if I don't fuck up.
14744000	14746880	Kind of worth it if I don't mess it up.
14749360	14752960	I think I'm going to have to do it. I do. Okay, okay, okay.
14752960	14761840	What? You moved me. Please focus on that fly above you.
14763840	14767360	Please. The fly. Oh, okay.
14769680	14773440	Okay, the poison damage is, I don't know. Did we do it?
14775120	14781920	Okay. No, no, no, no, no, no. The fly. The fly. Look at the fly. No, Mars, please.
14781920	14784000	How did you even do that? I was looking above.
14786880	14791840	Oh my gosh. Oh, all right, we've got damage. That's all. Okay, I'm luck. Okay, I'll take it.
14793520	14798160	I'm going to be sick. Anonymous. Thank you. You didn't say anything in your message. Thank you,
14798160	14805120	though. I will take that as your silent support of this run. This most stressful encounter. I'm
14805120	14809360	going to have to tell my dad to stop doing whatever he's doing. I'm actually about to talk.
14810880	14818480	It's fine. We're okay. We're okay. Relax, relax, relax, relax, relax. Okay,
14819840	14829680	marked. I don't like marked. That's shit. Okay. That's right. Just look at the fly.
14830240	14837680	Mimic chest. The fly is so delicious, isn't it? My heart just jumped. It's fine. We have a holy card
14837680	14844480	and we have the card repeater. Curse of the maze strikes again. Curse of the maze wasn't supposed
14844480	14851200	to put us in here, but okay. We already have it back. Thankfully, we also have voltage or
14851200	14858240	whatever it's called. I'll just forget the name between them both. Relax, relax, relax. Safety,
14858240	14864000	safety, safety, safety, safety, safety, safety, safety. I'm not sure what we would benefit in an
14864000	14874000	arcade. Hell, maybe. Give us our item room. I am, yeah, I was purposely-
14874000	14893040	Oh, my heart is jumping. Speed. I'll take speed. That can get us away from the enemy.
14893680	14904800	Okay. I can pick all these up. That's fine. Check it was in the shop. A greed bait. That's fine.
14906800	14912320	Okay. Okay, absolutely wait for me. That damage upgrade? Fantastic. I'll take 12 more of them,
14912320	14919600	please. I'll have 14 more. Right. Okay. So greed can no longer appear in shops because we dealt with
14919600	14926320	greed and super greed. So now for the boss. Right, we're going to check out the arcade. I have plenty
14926320	14937120	of money to go around. No. But thank you though. But no thanks. Okay, we're just going to gently
14937120	14946880	make our way, Mosey, our way back to the boss fight. Now, this is ma'am. Oh, it's the end, isn't it?
14946880	14951360	It's the last shop. Oh, you're right. I don't realize how fast we're going through it. Not me going
14951360	14964720	faster in this mode than like actually playing a regular cane run. Okay. Okay, okay. That's fine.
14966560	14973520	Wow, we are so interested in that one fly, aren't we? Oh, we love that one fly. Thank God I have
14973520	14977600	the mod that lets me actually see when she's stomping down. Mars, not now.
14990240	14991120	Not now, Mars.
14995680	15000480	I was really hoping for a Pluto because we could get such a small hitbox with Pluto.
15001040	15008720	We did it. What are we taking though? What's the question? Enjoying, sure.
15010720	15012240	What are we taking? Damage?
15017040	15025360	Invincibility. That was cat. Damage. Taking damage at half a red heart and none. Damage. Okay, the
15025360	15036720	negative. 7.61, that was good. That was good, right. Hold it together,
15036720	15046800	refling. Hold it together. I'm very nervous. Yeah, I don't even have one unlock on him.
15047520	15054560	Just, I'm going to use a lot of rocks for cover and stuff like that.
15061680	15067200	Or moam down like that, that's also an option. I'm going to pick up all I can. If we get like
15067200	15070320	beggars, I'm just going to give it to them. They might be able to this.
15070320	15073440	Assist us.
15078000	15081680	I am so sorry if I seem like such a tryhard. It's because I am tryharding.
15082720	15085440	Please follow the fly, not me, the fly.
15088080	15097440	Okay, take your time. That was naughty. That was very naughty.
15101280	15109440	Oh my god, my dad's gone for a piss.
15110400	15122560	The toilet's right outside my door.
15128240	15133360	All right, let's try that again, shall we? There's a shame we didn't get more pills. You
15133360	15136560	know that should have bought the pills in the shop. I just think I was paying enough attention.
15136640	15140240	That's on me. Oh, that's on me. That was my mistake.
15144480	15151360	You first. You next. Just take your time. We've got, time is on our side, okay?
15152320	15156800	Where there's no timer, there's no rush. We just need to find the boss room.
15159360	15164320	I'm fine. I'm not just randomly singing out terrifying fear. Okay, that's fantastic.
15165040	15168320	We're going to see if there's a, oh, there you go.
15170880	15173120	I just realized that thing splattered and could have got us.
15175040	15178080	What the hell, Shrek 5 is real. Are you guys trolling me right now in the middle of this
15178640	15187520	very intense game? Please look at the fly. The fly, yes, the fly. The fly. Oh my gosh.
15188080	15195520	Oh my gosh, are we going to do it? Size down, hit box smaller. I repeat, hit box smaller.
15197520	15202240	Hit box, stop, Marshmars. I was going to say Marshmallow. No.
15207200	15215920	Wow, wow, wow, wow. Okay, that's fine. Okay, holy cards. We'll have everything. Okay.
15217520	15220960	All out for head. Yeah, Shrek 5 is in production. It's almost enough, so.
15221680	15226240	You really deserve a cola. I will, I am going to lie down after this one. I can tell you that much.
15230960	15237840	Gamer instinct. Where is the boss? Top left. Okay, gamer instinct. Don't let us down.
15238880	15242880	Now again, we have spectral tears. We will use rocks to our full advantage.
15243840	15251840	Okay.
15253360	15256960	Oh, that's okay, Marsh. You were allowed to do that when I'm not in a fate,
15256960	15263600	but when I'm in a fate, Marsh, no, Marsh, that's naughty. You're a naughty boy, Marsh. You know,
15263600	15270320	I didn't want you. You know, I wanted you to be Pluto. Shit. Please do not fuck up in this room.
15271280	15274880	Okay, yeah, let's go for the day. Yes, yeah, let's go for the...
15275680	15280240	See how there was a flat wall and all the enemies spawned right side? Do not tear or touch that.
15283360	15291040	Okay. Okay, okay. Sorry, I am tryharding out the Wazoo. I'm not even pretending.
15291040	15294480	We could do Gambo, but we don't have a beggar, so there's no point. I'm telling you,
15294560	15296880	do it on purpose. I will fly it in your boot, too.
15299840	15304960	I don't want to break these rocks. These rocks can break into splatters. I might actually hurt
15304960	15316640	myself. I know. Go away. Oh, gamer instinct. Oh, my gosh, gamer instinct. They can fly,
15316640	15321760	they can fly. They fly now. They fly now. They fly now. Okay, okay, to get it.
15322720	15326560	Yeah, he could fly a couple of episodes back, but it's fine. He'll let us sleep.
15329120	15332240	No, I could only be, like, if it wasn't here, I could only be there.
15339760	15343200	Oh, no, I messed up. I messed up. I messed up.
15343840	15348880	Oh, go for the fly. Go for the fly. We love the fly. We love casting spells. Shadow Wizard,
15349440	15355840	yeah. Mars saved me. Mars, I judged you too quickly. Forgive my ignorance,
15355840	15361840	for I did not know what I was judging. I love you, Mars. We love the planet. We love the red
15361840	15369520	planet. We love the iron-ice planet. Oh, that's fine. It's fine.
15372560	15378480	Wait, on half a heart or less, I assume that counts right now. Surely that counts right now.
15379200	15387040	Oh, okay, okay, we're in the money. Not as being able to do hush, absolutely not, right?
15387040	15393360	We took the negative, we must go down. We must stay focused. Yay, now you're all...
15395600	15402640	Babylon works. Okay, gamer instincts. Bottom right, gamer instincts, bottom right.
15402880	15409840	Shh, you know what? I've had a lot of gamer instincts today. Let's try that again. I meant
15409840	15417920	to say right, right, it's for gamer... Okay, hold on. We can take these. Yes, please. Range,
15419040	15426000	speed, sure. Something's wrong. Short speed, absolutely. Power pill, no.
15426800	15431920	Okay, please do not whip me through the rock. I would appreciate that.
15433680	15437920	Do we want to be max speed? I don't know if we actually want to be max speed,
15437920	15444640	because it gets very slippery. No, no, no, no, no, no, focus on the fly, the fly, the fly.
15449200	15453920	Oh, are you ranged? Yep, I want to shoot from halfway across the room.
15453920	15456320	If I'm correct, about right side gamer instinct.
15462160	15469360	I am wrong. Okay, go for the thing, go for the thing, not me, go for the fly. Go for the fly!
15470880	15478160	The fly! Go for the fly! Oh, what was the secret room, though? Because why would it be,
15478640	15486880	no. Okay, it's top right. I was close. Okay, do not roll over any rocks that have spikes in them.
15487920	15489520	What are you and why are you that colour?
15494480	15499600	No secret room, secret room above? Okay, these rooms are getting odd, though.
15500400	15508560	Stay in the rocks, shiver me timbers. My timbers have been shivered.
15510560	15516720	Oh, in the rock. Oh, laser beam! I did not even see that laser beam, that was so lucky.
15517600	15525040	I did not even see that beam. I'm happy with my trinket, I will not be tempted.
15529840	15533360	He doesn't go away. Okay, that's fine. He doesn't have to go away, okay.
15535760	15543760	Gamer, oh no, it's the Satan fight, okay. Gamer instinct, go for the fly. No Mars, not now.
15546560	15551520	Okay, they're going for the fly, I'm happy. Okay, Satan, go for the fly, go for the fly,
15551520	15555840	go for the fly, Satan, go for the fly, Satan, go for the fly, go for the fly. We love,
15555840	15565760	we love going for flies. Yes, good, Satan. Now, the last fight, go for the fly,
15567440	15577920	go for the fly, the fly. We love the fly, we love the fly, we, we lost fly.
15578080	15587280	Oh, God, are we doing it? Can we do it? Can we do lamb on tainted?
15589680	15599280	Oh, we can take nothing, can we take anything from here? I don't know how it works,
15599280	15602080	can we take anything? We have Athene, I've never had Athene.
15602800	15611200	Can I take one thing from here? Take one, I am, take brimstone, okay, I trust you.
15614160	15621120	Okay, shit. Oh, it's homing, I have homing, I forgot.
15624000	15628800	I forgot we had homing. Oh, what, there's three? I thought there was two.
15629200	15632000	Two. Mars, not now, buddy.
15639440	15642240	I have a sore stomach because I'm gaming so hard.
15644080	15647920	Stop, look at the fly, look at the fly, we love the fly.
15649760	15656400	How I did not lose anything there. Oh, the fly, please.
15659440	15665440	Okay, okay, the fly. No, do not give me bombs.
15669200	15674560	Oh, consecutive tier hits, yes sir. The fly.
15676880	15682720	You know you want to take that, Gro, I almost just walked into him and substituted my holy mantle.
15683120	15684640	Oh.
15687840	15696400	Tears can bounce, can brimstone bounce on these cheeks? I'm asking for a friend, can brimstone bounce?
15699120	15703840	Oh my gosh, where is it? Is it bottom left?
15707120	15711040	It's either left up or down left, so strong I can hear that.
15711040	15714800	So strongly I heard the stream is pre-recorded one or counter that.
15714800	15718560	I read it before your thing loaded, get right, that's how it's not pre-recorded.
15720560	15724000	It's not what we want, but it's okay, thank you for your submission.
15727920	15734400	Okay, that's right, like that, the fly is getting, oh, wow, wow.
15734400	15736640	Thank you Broly legend for the tip, I'm so sorry.
15737600	15741040	Nope, we're absolutely not, proof that this is pre-recorded confirmed.
15741040	15745680	That's not, how, oh no, okay, he's gonna be occupied with that fly.
15746880	15752800	Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, okay, it has to be left side.
15755680	15760720	I don't, I don't think I want that, I don't know, you guys will tell me if I should take it or not.
15761440	15767120	Okay, will you guys tell me if I need that?
15767680	15772800	Inner eye, decreases my fire rate, Isaac shoots three tears at once though.
15774800	15777520	Triple shot is good, slower shot but three.
15778320	15780960	Doesn't give you triple brimstone, I have no idea.
15780960	15782480	I have wall bouncing as well.
15785040	15789040	Let's find out, is it wall bounce, oh okay, it like fully wall bounces.
15791280	15796080	Oh wow, okay, wow, wee wee wow.
15797680	15799680	Oh, I missed that shot, that's okay.
15801840	15804000	It's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay.
15804640	15809600	Oh, and we got a fricking unbelievably, we got that back, unbelievably, I can't believe that.
15809600	15812080	I do believe, but it happens so I believe it, I believe.
15814880	15816960	Spiders do not give contact damage.
15816960	15824000	Now, hear me out, we go back and try and pick up as much items as possible or do you think we can do it?
15826240	15832080	Did we just go for it or did I go back and pick up as, wait, you say pre, if I unlock delirium,
15832080	15837440	you're right, if I unlock delirium we have to send it for delirium, so I'm going to try and unlock everything.
15839760	15842960	Perfect, we're gonna, we might get delirium, okay,
15843680	15846960	and if we do, I want to be as ready as I can be.
15848160	15850240	Mars, you are so cheeky.
15851680	15855760	You're a cheeky boy Mars and you know exactly what you're doing, giving me a heart attack.
15858000	15865120	Okay, bombs, sure, poison immunity, a chance for a random direction, sure, I'll absolutely take that, are you joking?
15867440	15868400	What we got, what we got?

15873840	15876160	okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.
15878400	15887440	We pray for delirium, we pray for delirium, I can't believe I'm asking for delirium, but I am, no,
15889360	15893120	no, no, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, not a good pick up.
15897440	15901760	There might be a secret room here but I don't know, I don't know,
15902320	15910320	maybe here, there you go, no, room, room, delirium doesn't close when you exit the room,
15910320	15912160	I didn't know that, hello, okay,

15969280	15978560	okay, delirium, I'm coming for you buddy, I don't know where you are but let's go for it,
15979840	15985440	now you do get boss items by doing boss room so we could upgrade our current stash,
15986880	15988320	spiders don't hurt us, let's go,
15989040	15997760	oh, can we do delirium as a question, Mars, stop, you naughty boy,
16000640	16010000	sure, sure, how do it, oh, come on,

16019760	16023040	okay, school x, not to be confused,
16029520	16033600	I mean, at this point does keys make a difference, not really, might as well just take them,
16034240	16038560	he could maybe give us a guffy from a red chest if he were to drop one,
16042480	16046560	okay, so unfortunately our first item didn't give us anything good but that's okay,
16054080	16059200	we're just playing it nice and safe, take that key,
16064080	16070480	okay, okay, nice and safe,
16072400	16076160	is that a boogie, no I don't want some boogie, thank you though,
16077520	16080880	that's a lot of items, keys, oh I could have given it to him,
16082080	16087200	didn't take that far, hey did oh, surely I'm just blasting this to oblivion, stream,
16088000	16095920	oh, respawn though, what happens if you respawn, don't be shy, respawn some more,
16097840	16099920	drain's all short speed,
16104240	16113120	wait, keys, you want to take that key, oh no, it's one of these rooms, is it,
16113120	16118160	it's one of these rooms,
16124400	16129120	I can chase them around the room, oh thank you buddy, look there's more keys for you if you want
16129120	16135840	them, what are you thinking, you want this key too, no, you shy, okay, you don't have to,
16135840	16140160	you don't have to give me keys all the time, it's fine, oh no, okay, another new chest,
16140160	16148880	okay, okay more money, thanks mate, more key, oh, oh I do like bird food, but can I do it,
16149680	16154480	can I do it, I've no got two trinket slots, unless, do I, I don't know, I'll go back, oh sorry,
16155200	16162560	I was gonna hand it to him physically, after the holy chest it just stops items, I wish I had freaking
16163520	16170880	another slot for dead bird because that's like another player on the map really,
16170880	16178880	able to, anyways, I start to bless them, I am sweeping, that cannot be a secret room,
16178880	16195040	okay, no key, okay, oh, just mild stress with delirium,
16197840	16205920	shumer goes to hospital for a heart attack due to playing the lost on Isaac, that'd be quite the
16205920	16212480	headline, my stomach's sore, my heart isn't sore, but my stomach's sore, it's twisting,
16212480	16221120	out of nervousness, that could have gone terribly wrong, I'll remember there's a
16221120	16233280	arrow in here, but there's not too much I can do with it, come on, oh wow, I'd shot too late,
16234000	16245360	or early hover, don't do that to me, my heart can't take it, mimic chest, now's not the time to show up,
16245920	16254800	now is not the time for mimic chest to show up, do I make myself clear, arrange up,
16262480	16270240	full health, full mapping, okay, now we can use this to our advantage,
16271200	16280000	if we go down we can get to boss, we can get boss fights that aren't delirium confirmed,
16284000	16292160	did I almost just walk into a chest though, I almost did it wrong, okay, we can
16292480	16295600	take this, keep her sat,
16299440	16303280	I mean it's too late now, I'm sorry,
16305760	16309760	keep taking his weakies, I'm sorry, I don't mean it, I promise I'm doing it on purpose buddy,
16311680	16316000	which is very low IQ right now, okay there, take it,
16316240	16320400	right, this one can't be delirium,
16323200	16329120	I'll take that, are you joking, all stats up, I'll take that, right, what one can't be delirium,
16336400	16339920	I mean it's unlikely it's this one, it looks like the top left is delirium,
16340880	16352960	down is free, gentle, what do we get, a bane, I don't want a bane,
16356400	16360960	which one, it looks like that left one, like if you look where I'm literally
16360960	16365200	standing in the game on the map, I think that one's delirium, I mean this one
16365440	16373120	and the one over there, right, we'll go up for now because I don't think the one up is delirium,
16375360	16380160	sack and sausage, I don't even see that, I'll take that, are you joking,
16382880	16386160	okay, no keys for you this time buddy, sorry,
16387040	16396160	okay, a blast assist, okay, down left is free, okay and then delirium is where I think he is on
16396160	16404400	the map, sure bottoms why not, then yeah we've got one more boss to walk by and then it's delirium,
16404400	16411360	oh boy, I hope because we are smaller,
16413360	16420320	we are gonna be okay, yeah for a second, yeah, I hope because we are smaller, our hitbox does not
16420320	16430320	right just, okay,
16434560	16443280	okay, that was dangerous, oh there's pins, okay that was lucky,
16443280	16447040	okay, oh right,
16450000	16455200	how much more OP can I get, I've come on a smaller hitbox, let's go,
16458160	16465120	ooh, oh you're so funny like that delirium, you think I didn't see silly sausage, I don't
16465120	16472480	know exactly where you are, you think I don't have the skill, the intellect, the foresight
16472480	16478240	to know what's going on with you Mr. Delirium, do you think I do not know these things, your
16478240	16487520	crafty ways, your terrible reign against poor Isaac that you have, the grasp that the boy cannot seem
16487520	16498960	to undo, stop it delirium, you're upsetting me, I'm one shot, no well I have a Hail Mary,
16501840	16510560	you're upsetting me delirium, no more will you harm the child known as Isaac,
16510880	16515920	the boy will no peace, he will ascend without you,
16522880	16523760	did I do it,
16524080	16532400	did I do it, I did it, I unlocked ghost bombs,
16534960	16537920	I did it, oh my god,
16542080	16550480	oh I don't, that's not registered, I did that, I just did that, my first ever look like tainted lost,
16554640	16558320	oh my god, that's not registering,
16560240	16565600	what did I say about this stream being squitted being pre-recorded and that you would win your
16565600	16571200	first lost run on stream, I think maybe you need to comfort me instead of the other way around
16571200	16579280	for all the denial, now be a good girl and come cuddle me, oh my god, what just happened,
16580240	16585840	thank you so much, anonymous, you never even said anything, thank you tiny spiny for the tip,

16630240	16637440	oh, we unlocked ghost bombs,
16641520	16644720	well I don't know where they'd be but I assume somewhere near the end,
16647360	16654000	you're so good, no that was luck, literally we started with homing, the spin is the only reason
16654000	16660800	I could do that run, the spoon is the only reason, scrawny has humbling bundle in real life, okay
16660800	16667360	that's actually really good, ghost bomb for ghost bomb, you have to take them up to have them appear
16667360	16672720	twice, might have said in before at the start the run that died on the second room doesn't count,
16673360	16679760	thank you no alessandro, we did it, amazing performance, I don't know how I did that,
16680160	16686080	ghost bombs, I don't know where they're hiding but they're somewhere here,
