00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,480
Development can be rough in a VTuber agency and yellow was no different.

2
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:09,440
I knew from the beginning I wanted a hypnosis theme and it took quite a few

3
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:12,640
attempts to become the cuttlefish you know and recognize today.

4
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:16,640
Yes you are allowed to laugh, this was literally my first draft.

5
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:22,320
I quickly was developed to be a cuttlefish early on but I took a very splatoonly

6
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:25,120
vape which wasn't quite what I wanted.

7
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:29,280
Then from this outline you can actually see my shape and pupils are already in place

8
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:31,280
which is amazing.

9
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:36,240
Then a big switch-up happened and I was drawn in a yukata with permanent swirl eyes

10
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:39,920
which was later changed into my classic cuttlefish pupil eyes.

11
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:44,480
Then finally we arrived at my pearlescent design and I am none other than

12
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:46,960
