1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Okay, hopefully I'm not too big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big,

2
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:54,000
big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big

3
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,280
big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big

4
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:01,880
big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big

5
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,720
big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big,

6
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:13,020
big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big,

7
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:18,080
big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big,

8
00:01:18,220 --> 00:01:22,380
big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big,

9
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:30,480
I have a shotcaller on and I have a heart rate monitor on, bottom left is my heart rate,

10
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:35,620
high and the shotcaller is around my thigh because I'm worried about my neck because

11
00:01:35,620 --> 00:01:39,460
I have a few heart conditions, underlying heart conditions but that's okay, it's the

12
00:01:39,460 --> 00:01:42,620
kind that I'm going to be okay.

13
00:01:42,620 --> 00:01:49,220
So we're going to play on normal mode and I'm pretty sure they have an easy-peasy mode.

14
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:56,220
Yeah, okay, so we're going to do normal, we're going to do start with normal but hello hi.

15
00:01:58,220 --> 00:02:03,220
I'm going to do it without a timer because we're not doing...

16
00:02:03,220 --> 00:02:09,220
So we've got fucking everything alright?

17
00:02:09,220 --> 00:02:11,220
Okay, we've got everything.

18
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:17,220
I'm just going to put everything on so it's a fucking shot in the dark.

19
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:21,220
Okay, there's a baby mode, we're like 2 plus 2, that's exactly what we're doing.

20
00:02:21,220 --> 00:02:23,220
This is probably the only one I'm going to win on.

21
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:27,220
Howdy, my favourite Scottish fish pimp.

22
00:02:27,220 --> 00:02:31,220
No, you can't call me that, that's only...

23
00:02:31,220 --> 00:02:33,220
Don't you shock yourself to the point of heart.

24
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:34,220
I'll be okay.

25
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:37,220
I do have a cup of tea.

26
00:02:37,220 --> 00:02:41,220
So if you saw it, Maryse Modisse did have an ASMR role play up.

27
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:46,220
Unfortunately the subtitles messed up and she wasn't satisfied with it so

28
00:02:46,220 --> 00:02:51,220
I've elected to take it down, I will fix it, so be prepared tomorrow.

29
00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:53,220
Why are you shocking yourself?

30
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:58,220
Every time I get something wrong I'm going to trade my brain to be right only.

31
00:02:58,220 --> 00:03:05,220
If I am wrong I will zap myself and cause a pain response in my mind

32
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:10,220
which means that my brain will automatically pick the correct answer

33
00:03:10,220 --> 00:03:13,220
even if it doesn't know what the correct answer is.

34
00:03:13,220 --> 00:03:17,220
I will use all the collective and accumulative knowledge in my travels

35
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:21,220
which is not much because let's be honest, I sat on the Xbox all my life.

36
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:23,220
So that's how we're doing it, okay?

37
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:25,220
I do have an announcement for Snow Berries.

38
00:03:25,220 --> 00:03:30,220
AC recorded a YouTube role play ASMR so if she gives me the green light

39
00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:34,220
I will upload that to refill some copium levels.

40
00:03:34,220 --> 00:03:38,220
I assure you AC has missed you as much as you have missed her.

41
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:40,220
Snow Berries, okay?

42
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:44,220
Oh you agreed with me on the short.

43
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:49,220
I thought that, I was like didn't I reply to a comment that was exactly like that?

44
00:03:49,220 --> 00:03:53,220
Yes, I have a new short out where I stutter if you've not seen it

45
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:56,220
but I'm going to have, I'm going to drink my tea.

46
00:03:56,220 --> 00:04:02,220
Reflings, my aim tonight, my little goal is I'm going to collab with Said.

47
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:06,220
I'm going to finish that collab and I'm going to do the pregnancy ASMR as well

48
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:09,220
so I've got my work cut out for me but that's not going to stop me.

49
00:04:10,220 --> 00:04:13,220
Then they're going to stop me because I'm such a hard worker.

50
00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:19,220
After this stream we're doing shock ASMR.

51
00:04:19,220 --> 00:04:21,220
I don't know how it's going to work.

52
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:24,220
It's not going to be an ASMR stream, let's all freaking admit it.

53
00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:29,220
But yes, my goal is I'm going to do the AC audio one collab with me

54
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:33,220
and my pregnant with you ASMR.

55
00:04:34,220 --> 00:04:37,220
A little bit of work but we're getting there.

56
00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:43,220
The third audio editor is actually going to be Ed and AC

57
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:49,220
and just need to hand over all the like SFX and stuff and her lines and that

58
00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:52,220
but AC's been doing a lot of work behind the scenes.

59
00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:54,220
Holy moly.

60
00:04:54,220 --> 00:04:57,220
She was like here's all these audios and here's this YouTube roleplay as well.

61
00:04:57,220 --> 00:04:59,220
If you have any more just send them away.

62
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:01,220
I'm like ooh.

63
00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:02,220
Okay.

64
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:04,220
I'm going to send them to them.

65
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:06,220
You don't have to tell me twice.

66
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:16,220
I'm going to see if I can convince her to maybe do a recorded thing in my barber.

67
00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:18,220
Hi. Hi, we're playing.

68
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:21,220
Hi, Stroni. I can't wait for the thunder.

69
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:23,220
Give me the zap.

70
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:28,220
Content factory. Yes.

71
00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:34,220
And I have very funny news about her membership name.

72
00:05:34,220 --> 00:05:38,220
Now if you go and look on AC's membership name it says Snow Berries right now.

73
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:43,220
She just submitted to me a message 10 minutes ago on what she wants to change it to

74
00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:48,220
and I said right not right now because I just changed her name and YouTube gave me a heart attack

75
00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:51,220
because it was like it needs to go through approval.

76
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:55,220
But what she sent me was rather interesting.

77
00:05:55,220 --> 00:05:57,220
Shot caller. It's on my leg.

78
00:05:57,220 --> 00:05:59,220
Like I don't know if you can hear this.

79
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:01,220
That's the device.

80
00:06:01,220 --> 00:06:05,220
It's got like a little knobbly, bobbly bit at the top and all that.

81
00:06:07,220 --> 00:06:12,220
She's been something about getting a blowjob with a whole knee.

82
00:06:13,220 --> 00:06:15,220
Okay, we're just going to go for it.

83
00:06:15,220 --> 00:06:16,220
This is the warm up okay.

84
00:06:16,220 --> 00:06:19,220
I will shock myself either way but this is the warm up.

85
00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:21,220
I call me Big Julie why I know.

86
00:06:21,220 --> 00:06:24,220
My passion is being social.

87
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:28,220
Did I turn that down?

88
00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:30,220
The way I love words coming out of my mouth.

89
00:06:30,220 --> 00:06:32,220
I'm so social.

90
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:34,220
The way I love just hearing my voice.

91
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:36,220
Press any button and continue.

92
00:06:36,220 --> 00:06:40,220
This is the warm up as I have my tea.

93
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:44,220
I just dropped my tea everywhere.

94
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:46,220
I went on the shot caller.

95
00:06:46,220 --> 00:06:49,220
Why am I like this replay?

96
00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:51,220
Oh my God.

97
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:55,220
Oh, damn.

98
00:06:55,220 --> 00:06:57,220
I don't know if it's like this.

99
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:03,220
Mail on stream.

100
00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:05,220
Okay, let's go.

101
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:07,220
Let's go.

102
00:07:07,220 --> 00:07:09,220
Dry it, you may get it destroyed.

103
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:11,220
It didn't go in the electronical part.

104
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:13,220
It went on the strap.

105
00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:15,220
Thank you for having chosen me.

106
00:07:15,220 --> 00:07:17,220
Thank you for having chosen me.

107
00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:21,220
Let's play who wants to be a millionaire.

108
00:07:21,220 --> 00:07:23,220
Oh my God, I've got heels on another hand.

109
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:27,220
You know the money ladder and it's 15 steps to reach the million.

110
00:07:27,220 --> 00:07:29,220
Just need to get 15 questions right.

111
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:30,220
We can do it.

112
00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:32,220
We can do it.

113
00:07:36,220 --> 00:07:37,220
Okay, okay.

114
00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:39,220
Call and be a lawyer.

115
00:07:39,220 --> 00:07:42,220
Ask the audience and flip the question.

116
00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:48,220
Here's a new question for you.

117
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:54,220
Which sitcom character's favourite superhero is the Flash?

118
00:07:57,220 --> 00:07:59,220
Sheldon Cooper, I think.

119
00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:01,220
I actually know that one.

120
00:08:01,220 --> 00:08:02,220
Excuse me, sir.

121
00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:04,220
I'd like to look and see Sheldon Cooper.

122
00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:06,220
I'm going to choose C.

123
00:08:06,220 --> 00:08:08,220
I'm pretty sure it's the Flash.

124
00:08:09,220 --> 00:08:12,220
Did I not select it?

125
00:08:12,220 --> 00:08:14,220
Well, I was pranking him.

126
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:16,220
I touched it, but I didn't select.

127
00:08:16,220 --> 00:08:19,220
That's my final answer.

128
00:08:19,220 --> 00:08:21,220
Okay, okay.

129
00:08:21,220 --> 00:08:24,220
Oh, I can't wait to see the correct answer.

130
00:08:24,220 --> 00:08:26,220
Oh, I can't wait.

131
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:27,220
Yes!

132
00:08:27,220 --> 00:08:28,220
Okay, thank you.

133
00:08:28,220 --> 00:08:29,220
Thank you.

134
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:31,220
Do I have to shock myself just yet?

135
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:32,220
We believe it.

136
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:33,220
It's climbing quickly.

137
00:08:33,220 --> 00:08:35,220
100 smacker rings.

138
00:08:35,220 --> 00:08:36,220
Oh, I'm rich.

139
00:08:36,220 --> 00:08:39,220
I'm getting Russian chips tonight.

140
00:08:39,220 --> 00:08:41,220
All of her twists.

141
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:43,220
Okay, we do know this one.

142
00:08:45,220 --> 00:08:47,220
I've almost finished the tea.

143
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:48,220
All of her twists.

144
00:08:48,220 --> 00:08:50,220
I do know this one.

145
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:51,220
Okay.

146
00:08:51,220 --> 00:08:53,220
Do you want the lambara?

147
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:55,220
I'll show you the lambara.

148
00:08:55,220 --> 00:08:57,220
Let's go with the right answer and therefore...

149
00:08:57,220 --> 00:08:58,220
Therefore...

150
00:08:58,220 --> 00:09:01,220
I feel like she'd be with absolutely Neil Harper.

151
00:09:01,220 --> 00:09:03,220
All of her twists, my boy.

152
00:09:03,220 --> 00:09:05,220
Yes, that's my final answer.

153
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:07,220
I'm a fucking streamdecker.

154
00:09:07,220 --> 00:09:09,220
Hold on, let me put my streamdecker.

155
00:09:09,220 --> 00:09:10,220
Hold on.

156
00:09:10,220 --> 00:09:12,220
For everyone to forget, I tried to make that joke.

157
00:09:12,220 --> 00:09:15,220
More like all of her twists, my balls.

158
00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:18,220
No, audience, don't clap over my joke.

159
00:09:18,220 --> 00:09:20,220
And go on to the next one.

160
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:22,220
No, audience, you're laughing up on my joke.

161
00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:24,220
Let's go for a whole new question.

162
00:09:24,220 --> 00:09:27,220
Also, I just want to say a warning right now.

163
00:09:27,220 --> 00:09:30,220
The likelihood of me farting is very high.

164
00:09:30,220 --> 00:09:34,220
Constipated and receiving pain is going to make me expel fucking air at my ass.

165
00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:36,220
I don't know how to say it.

166
00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:38,220
In the spelling of words in English,

167
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:42,220
my biggest weakness, which letter almost always falls Q?

168
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:43,220
It's actually you.

169
00:09:43,220 --> 00:09:44,220
Qeen.

170
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:47,220
Queen is the biggest example.

171
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:48,220
Final answer?

172
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:49,220
That was a great joke.

173
00:09:49,220 --> 00:09:51,220
Also, thanks for the heads up.

174
00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:52,220
Literally...

175
00:09:52,220 --> 00:09:53,220
That's my final answer.

176
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:54,220
I'm breaded again.

177
00:09:54,220 --> 00:09:56,220
I'm literally just shoving water up more so I don't even care.

178
00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:58,220
I'm so tired.

179
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:01,220
Just own it.

180
00:10:01,220 --> 00:10:02,220
You've got it.

181
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:04,220
Just a little golf clap.

182
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:05,220
Thank you.

183
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:06,220
Thank you.

184
00:10:06,220 --> 00:10:08,220
I'll be here all week.

185
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:10,220
I need to keep a close eye out.

186
00:10:10,220 --> 00:10:12,220
Oh, gosh.

187
00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:14,220
A slap shot.

188
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:17,220
A volleyball sounds like a slap shot.

189
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:20,220
Like slap it down really quickly.

190
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:23,220
What the fuck is handball?

191
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:26,220
I would say volleyball.

192
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:29,220
Surely volleyball is when you slap it down really quickly.

193
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:31,220
It's either handball or volleyball.

194
00:10:31,220 --> 00:10:32,220
I've never seen handball.

195
00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:33,220
No one knows what handball is.

196
00:10:33,220 --> 00:10:35,220
And on that basis, it's volleyball.

197
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:38,220
Because I've never seen handball in my life.

198
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:41,220
I know basketball is.

199
00:10:43,220 --> 00:10:46,220
I'm going to cry if I have to shock myself so quickly.

200
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:51,220
Bro, looking.

201
00:10:51,220 --> 00:10:52,220
Looking.

202
00:10:52,220 --> 00:10:54,220
Ironically.

203
00:10:55,220 --> 00:10:56,220
But it's the game.

204
00:10:56,220 --> 00:10:58,220
This is not the right answer.

205
00:10:58,220 --> 00:10:59,220
Oh, no.

206
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:01,220
Well, let's put things in perspective.

207
00:11:01,220 --> 00:11:03,220
What is hockey slap?

208
00:11:03,220 --> 00:11:05,220
Oh, my God.

209
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:07,220
Fortunately, it's all over.

210
00:11:07,220 --> 00:11:08,220
Oh, my God.

211
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:09,220
Right.

212
00:11:09,220 --> 00:11:10,220
Okay.

213
00:11:10,220 --> 00:11:11,220
Okay.

214
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:12,220
It's fine.

215
00:11:12,220 --> 00:11:13,220
It's fine.

216
00:11:13,220 --> 00:11:14,220
Hold on.

217
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:17,220
I think the anticipation is going to be worse than what it is.

218
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:18,220
I think then.

219
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:19,220
Yeah.

220
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:20,220
Thank you.

221
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:21,220
Great.

222
00:11:22,220 --> 00:11:23,220
Okay.

223
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:24,220
Okay.

224
00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:26,220
The anticipation is the worst bit.

225
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:27,220
That's what it is.

226
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:28,220
Are you ready?

227
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:31,220
I don't know if you can hear this click.

228
00:11:34,220 --> 00:11:35,220
Okay.

229
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:37,220
I could probably handle a bit more if I'm being honest.

230
00:11:37,220 --> 00:11:38,220
Okay.

231
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:39,220
I'll put it up by one next time.

232
00:11:39,220 --> 00:11:40,220
Okay.

233
00:11:40,220 --> 00:11:41,220
But there you go.

234
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:42,220
I got fucking wrong.

235
00:11:42,220 --> 00:11:43,220
Like a dumb ass.

236
00:11:43,220 --> 00:11:44,220
Right.

237
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:45,220
We know what the intro is like.

238
00:11:45,220 --> 00:11:46,220
And we know what the...

239
00:11:46,220 --> 00:11:47,220
Sorry.

240
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:49,220
I'm really bad with pain.

241
00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:52,220
I was like such a wee wimp, honestly.

242
00:11:52,220 --> 00:11:53,220
Right.

243
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:58,220
So we can kind of skip through the actual, like, all this stuff.

244
00:11:58,220 --> 00:11:59,220
Okay.

245
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:04,220
So we're going to skip all this bit because we've already done this bit.

246
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:10,220
And which of these would you keep your valuables in a safe?

247
00:12:11,220 --> 00:12:12,220
Surely.

248
00:12:12,220 --> 00:12:14,220
This is just straight up in English.

249
00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:17,220
Oh, your gambon on D.

250
00:12:18,220 --> 00:12:19,220
No, no.

251
00:12:19,220 --> 00:12:20,220
It turned Yelp.

252
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:22,220
I'm going to sound like Tom and Jerry by the end of the stream.

253
00:12:27,220 --> 00:12:30,220
If the button gets stuck, I can pull it off.

254
00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:31,220
Thanks, Holly.

255
00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:34,220
A harmless.

256
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:36,220
No, stop it.

257
00:12:36,220 --> 00:12:39,220
Who am I supposed to know?

258
00:12:40,220 --> 00:12:41,220
Oh.

259
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:43,220
Amy.

260
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:44,220
Merci.

261
00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:46,220
Amy.

262
00:12:46,220 --> 00:12:47,220
Merci.

263
00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:48,220
Obliette.

264
00:12:48,220 --> 00:12:49,220
Okay.

265
00:12:49,220 --> 00:12:50,220
It's true.

266
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:53,220
But if I was born French, I'd be called Pierre.

267
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:54,220
Who would go...

268
00:12:54,220 --> 00:12:56,220
Who would birth a child to be like,

269
00:12:56,220 --> 00:13:00,220
I have a child and I am French speaking.

270
00:13:00,220 --> 00:13:02,220
I will call him Justine.

271
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:04,220
Like, no, it's Pierre.

272
00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:07,220
Who's going to call there Wayne Justin?

273
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:09,220
Like, that's not going to work.

274
00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:10,220
Yes, it's my final answer.

275
00:13:10,220 --> 00:13:11,220
Thank you.

276
00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:13,220
Yes.

277
00:13:13,220 --> 00:13:14,220
That's my final answer.

278
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:16,220
Justine, my child.

279
00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:17,220
Okay.

280
00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:19,220
The computer validated your answer.

281
00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:21,220
Wait, what do you mean?

282
00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:22,220
Oh, no, it's drawn out.

283
00:13:22,220 --> 00:13:27,220
Oh, why would you spawn a child and call it Justine?

284
00:13:28,220 --> 00:13:30,220
Do you want that thing to be bullied?

285
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:33,220
We had to play the card of cause.

286
00:13:33,220 --> 00:13:35,220
Why would you spawn and go...

287
00:13:36,220 --> 00:13:37,220
Nothing.

288
00:13:37,220 --> 00:13:38,220
I'm sorry for you.

289
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:40,220
Bravo.

290
00:13:40,220 --> 00:13:41,220
It's Cubic for...

291
00:13:43,220 --> 00:13:46,220
No, I've got to add three.

292
00:13:46,220 --> 00:13:47,220
Fuck.

293
00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:48,220
Right.

294
00:13:48,220 --> 00:13:49,220
Okay.

295
00:13:49,220 --> 00:13:50,220
It's fine.

296
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:51,220
It's fine.

297
00:13:51,220 --> 00:13:52,220
I've got to add three.

298
00:13:52,220 --> 00:13:53,220
I can do it.

299
00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:54,220
Okay.

300
00:13:54,220 --> 00:13:55,220
It's fine.

301
00:13:55,220 --> 00:13:56,220
So the anticipation is what gets you the most.

302
00:13:56,220 --> 00:13:57,220
Okay.

303
00:13:57,220 --> 00:13:58,220
It's anticipation.

304
00:13:58,220 --> 00:13:59,220
Right.

305
00:13:59,220 --> 00:14:00,220
You ready?

306
00:14:00,220 --> 00:14:01,220
Oh, I'm scared.

307
00:14:01,220 --> 00:14:02,220
I'm actually scared.

308
00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:03,220
Right.

309
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:04,220
Okay.

310
00:14:04,220 --> 00:14:05,220
Okay.

311
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:06,220
Okay.

312
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:07,220
Okay.

313
00:14:07,220 --> 00:14:08,220
Okay.

314
00:14:08,220 --> 00:14:09,220
Okay.

315
00:14:09,220 --> 00:14:10,220
I'm starting to set.

316
00:14:10,220 --> 00:14:11,220
I'm starting to set.

317
00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:12,220
I'm going to put it up to four.

318
00:14:12,220 --> 00:14:13,220
It's then one four because I did it on one.

319
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:14,220
I felt it.

320
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:15,220
Oh my God.

321
00:14:15,220 --> 00:14:17,220
I need to move it like around the thigh area though.

322
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:19,220
I don't want it all in one place.

323
00:14:19,220 --> 00:14:21,220
I don't want it all in one place.

324
00:14:21,220 --> 00:14:22,220
Okay.

325
00:14:22,220 --> 00:14:23,220
Okay.

326
00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:24,220
Let's go again.

327
00:14:24,220 --> 00:14:25,220
Again, again, again.

328
00:14:25,220 --> 00:14:26,220
Surely.

329
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:27,220
Surely will win.

330
00:14:27,220 --> 00:14:28,220
Surely.

331
00:14:28,220 --> 00:14:29,220
Copy on me.

332
00:14:29,220 --> 00:14:30,220
I'm going to have to play easy mode.

333
00:14:30,220 --> 00:14:31,220
Okay.

334
00:14:31,220 --> 00:14:32,220
We're on number four.

335
00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:34,220
There's 10 seconds on this.

336
00:14:34,220 --> 00:14:36,220
Although the instructions were fucked.

337
00:14:36,220 --> 00:14:40,220
Let me just tell you the instructions were really bad.

338
00:14:40,220 --> 00:14:49,220
They were like, oh, if your dog starts yelping, like remove the device immediately and discontinue

339
00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:50,220
its use.

340
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:52,220
It's not to be used like that.

341
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:56,220
And it was just sad that folk even had to like pop that thing down.

342
00:14:56,220 --> 00:14:57,220
Oh, God.

343
00:14:57,220 --> 00:14:59,220
Man, you popped up on another can.

344
00:14:59,220 --> 00:15:02,220
Time for this new question.

345
00:15:02,220 --> 00:15:03,220
Bro.

346
00:15:03,220 --> 00:15:06,220
It's time to get your tentacles sucked.

347
00:15:06,220 --> 00:15:11,220
Which of these is another name for a private detective?

348
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:13,220
A private eye.

349
00:15:13,220 --> 00:15:15,220
I'm choosing A.

350
00:15:15,220 --> 00:15:16,220
Copy on me.

351
00:15:16,220 --> 00:15:17,220
I have faith.

352
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:19,220
Mods knew that man at the stratosphere.

353
00:15:19,220 --> 00:15:21,220
He's literally got OBS on.

354
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:24,220
And he's tried to record all like the vealer talents.

355
00:15:24,220 --> 00:15:27,220
And he's like, let's see.

356
00:15:27,220 --> 00:15:28,220
Vealer Laminers.

357
00:15:28,220 --> 00:15:32,220
Like from complete play some video games.

358
00:15:33,220 --> 00:15:34,220
Relax.

359
00:15:34,220 --> 00:15:38,220
Which verb means to tap your fingers repetitively?

360
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:40,220
What verb is they're doing?

361
00:15:40,220 --> 00:15:43,220
Oh, to drum your fingers.

362
00:15:45,220 --> 00:15:48,220
But if it's a piano, it would do your fingers.

363
00:15:48,220 --> 00:15:50,220
A viola is eee.

364
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:53,220
And a flute is eee.

365
00:15:53,220 --> 00:15:54,220
A drum's you bang it.

366
00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:56,220
I assume it's piano.

367
00:15:56,220 --> 00:15:58,220
It has to be piano.

368
00:15:58,220 --> 00:16:01,220
You didn't drum your fingers.

369
00:16:01,220 --> 00:16:02,220
It is.

370
00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:04,220
You can't always win.

371
00:16:06,220 --> 00:16:07,220
That makes no sense.

372
00:16:07,220 --> 00:16:11,220
Who drums their fingers on the fucking table?

373
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:14,220
Why would you drum your fingers on the table?

374
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:15,220
Oh, excuse.

375
00:16:15,220 --> 00:16:17,220
Oh, sorry for distracting you.

376
00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:20,220
I was just drumming my fingers on the table.

377
00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:22,220
What you on about?

378
00:16:22,220 --> 00:16:25,220
That's not even English.

379
00:16:25,220 --> 00:16:27,220
Like, you piano a key.

380
00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:30,220
Because that's the way pianos look when you're touching a piano.

381
00:16:30,220 --> 00:16:31,220
Right, okay.

382
00:16:31,220 --> 00:16:33,220
Level four, okay?

383
00:16:33,220 --> 00:16:35,220
It's fine.

384
00:16:35,220 --> 00:16:36,220
It's fine.

385
00:16:36,220 --> 00:16:39,220
Who fucking pianos their table?

386
00:16:39,220 --> 00:16:40,220
Well, who fucking...

387
00:16:40,220 --> 00:16:42,220
No drum is tapping.

388
00:16:42,220 --> 00:16:44,220
It didn't say tap.

389
00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:45,220
Right, ready?

390
00:16:45,220 --> 00:16:46,220
Three, two, one.

391
00:16:46,220 --> 00:16:47,220
Ah!

392
00:16:47,220 --> 00:16:49,220
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

393
00:16:49,220 --> 00:16:50,220
We can go higher.

394
00:16:50,220 --> 00:16:53,220
Can we get much higher?

395
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:55,220
Okay, we're on five now.

396
00:16:55,220 --> 00:16:57,220
Absolute copium.

397
00:16:57,220 --> 00:16:59,220
Absolute copium.

398
00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:00,220
We're on five.

399
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:01,220
We're on five.

400
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:02,220
It's fine.

401
00:17:02,220 --> 00:17:03,220
I can handle it.

402
00:17:03,220 --> 00:17:04,220
I can handle it.

403
00:17:04,220 --> 00:17:06,220
Right, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go.

404
00:17:06,220 --> 00:17:09,220
I'm like breaking out in a sweat.

405
00:17:09,220 --> 00:17:11,220
Fucking...

406
00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:13,220
Right, who...

407
00:17:13,220 --> 00:17:15,220
Oh, come on!

408
00:17:15,220 --> 00:17:18,220
Who is Scrooge's nephew?

409
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:22,220
Donald Duck, I think.

410
00:17:22,220 --> 00:17:24,220
It's Donald, I think.

411
00:17:24,220 --> 00:17:26,220
I never saw that one because I didn't...

412
00:17:26,220 --> 00:17:28,220
I wasn't even a twinkle in my...

413
00:17:28,220 --> 00:17:29,220
I think it's Donald.

414
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:31,220
I think it's Donald!

415
00:17:33,220 --> 00:17:34,220
I think so.

416
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:35,220
I think so.

417
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:36,220
Yes, okay.

418
00:17:36,220 --> 00:17:37,220
Oh, thank God.

419
00:17:37,220 --> 00:17:38,220
Right, we're safe.

420
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:39,220
We're safe.

421
00:17:39,220 --> 00:17:40,220
I'm no good with this name.

422
00:17:40,220 --> 00:17:41,220
I needed to keep my cool and it paid off.

423
00:17:41,220 --> 00:17:43,220
Oh, I didn't keep my cool.

424
00:17:43,220 --> 00:17:49,220
How did Caviar Lime get its name?

425
00:17:49,220 --> 00:17:52,220
What is Caviar Lime?

426
00:17:52,220 --> 00:17:55,220
It contains little bowls that resemble Caviar.

427
00:17:55,220 --> 00:17:57,220
It tastes like Caviar.

428
00:17:57,220 --> 00:17:59,220
It is as expensive as Caviar.

429
00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:02,220
It is black like Caviar.

430
00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:06,220
What is Caviar Lime?

431
00:18:06,220 --> 00:18:08,220
I've never heard of it.

432
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:10,220
Oh, my God.

433
00:18:12,220 --> 00:18:14,220
What would Caviar Lime be?

434
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:15,220
A bar drink?

435
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:17,220
It's expensive as Caviar.

436
00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:20,220
Why would you buy a bar drink that's expensive as Caviar?

437
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:22,220
It is black like Caviar.

438
00:18:25,220 --> 00:18:27,220
No, it's not Tapioca.

439
00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:31,220
How did Caviar L...

440
00:18:31,220 --> 00:18:33,220
Who is Caviar Lime?

441
00:18:33,220 --> 00:18:36,220
When were you born and why is that your fucking name?

442
00:18:36,220 --> 00:18:37,220
What the fuck?

443
00:18:37,220 --> 00:18:38,220
It's black like Caviar.

444
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:39,220
It's expensive as Caviar.

445
00:18:39,220 --> 00:18:40,220
It tastes like...

446
00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:42,220
How am I supposed to know that?

447
00:18:42,220 --> 00:18:43,220
I don't even know.

448
00:18:43,220 --> 00:18:44,220
It's C. Can I just cheat?

449
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:45,220
Am I allowed to cheat?

450
00:18:45,220 --> 00:18:46,220
I was going to say D.

451
00:18:46,220 --> 00:18:48,220
It's a fruit!

452
00:18:49,220 --> 00:18:53,220
Oh, of course the fucking Scottish scurvy fucking afflicted Scott

453
00:18:53,220 --> 00:18:56,220
wouldn't know what a fucking Caviar Lime is.

454
00:18:56,220 --> 00:18:58,220
Oh, it's a Lime!

455
00:18:58,220 --> 00:19:00,220
Oh, I thought it was like a car.

456
00:19:00,220 --> 00:19:01,220
I'm going to be on it.

457
00:19:01,220 --> 00:19:02,220
I thought it was a car like a drink.

458
00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:04,220
Am I allowed to cheat and say C?

459
00:19:07,220 --> 00:19:10,220
Can I cheat and say C even though I was going to say D?

460
00:19:12,220 --> 00:19:13,220
No, put D.

461
00:19:15,220 --> 00:19:16,220
This is cheating.

462
00:19:16,220 --> 00:19:18,220
I didn't understand this.

463
00:19:19,220 --> 00:19:20,220
Oh my God, I didn't...

464
00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:22,220
I fucking had to...

465
00:19:22,220 --> 00:19:23,220
Right, okay.

466
00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:25,220
In my defense.

467
00:19:25,220 --> 00:19:27,220
Right, this is five.

468
00:19:27,220 --> 00:19:28,220
Okay.

469
00:19:28,220 --> 00:19:30,220
Oh, I'm actually getting nervous.

470
00:19:30,220 --> 00:19:31,220
Okay.

471
00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:33,220
Three...

472
00:19:33,220 --> 00:19:34,220
Two...

473
00:19:34,220 --> 00:19:35,220
One...

474
00:19:35,220 --> 00:19:37,220
Okay, okay.

475
00:19:37,220 --> 00:19:39,220
I can manage.

476
00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:40,220
I can manage.

477
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:42,220
The worst thing is, it's not one shock.

478
00:19:42,220 --> 00:19:43,220
It's...

479
00:19:43,220 --> 00:19:45,220
Like, that's how the shock is administered.

480
00:19:46,220 --> 00:19:49,220
So just when you think you're going to feel it for like once,

481
00:19:49,220 --> 00:19:50,220
it goes like,

482
00:19:50,220 --> 00:19:52,220
Oh, here's another one, bitch.

483
00:19:52,220 --> 00:19:53,220
It's like...

484
00:19:54,220 --> 00:19:55,220
Bruv.

485
00:19:55,220 --> 00:19:58,220
Caviar Lime, of course it was a fruit.

486
00:19:58,220 --> 00:20:00,220
But I thought it was like...

487
00:20:00,220 --> 00:20:01,220
You know how like...

488
00:20:01,220 --> 00:20:02,220
I don't know.

489
00:20:02,220 --> 00:20:05,220
I can't even think of an example right now.

490
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:07,220
I can't even think of an example.

491
00:20:07,220 --> 00:20:09,220
I got up to 145.

492
00:20:10,220 --> 00:20:13,220
John Omni, thank you so much.

493
00:20:13,220 --> 00:20:14,220
Anonymous tips, Johnny.

494
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:17,220
What in the world is piano a verb?

495
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:19,220
It makes more sense for your fingers.

496
00:20:19,220 --> 00:20:21,220
It said move your fingers.

497
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:28,220
Oh my God, Zara, please help me.

498
00:20:30,220 --> 00:20:32,220
What's not a shonen?

499
00:20:33,220 --> 00:20:35,220
Berserker, surely.

500
00:20:35,220 --> 00:20:37,220
Because Dragon Ball goes on forever.

501
00:20:37,220 --> 00:20:38,220
One piece goes on forever.

502
00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:40,220
Naruto went on forever.

503
00:20:40,220 --> 00:20:41,220
So it's Berserker.

504
00:20:41,220 --> 00:20:43,220
That's how it goes.

505
00:20:43,220 --> 00:20:47,220
If a shonen means that the show goes on for far too fucking long,

506
00:20:47,220 --> 00:20:50,220
and then they need to wrap it up, okay?

507
00:20:50,220 --> 00:20:51,220
They need to wrap it up,

508
00:20:51,220 --> 00:20:54,220
and Berserker got wrapped up, okay?

509
00:20:54,220 --> 00:20:55,220
And this is my logic...

510
00:20:55,220 --> 00:20:56,220
It worked!

511
00:20:57,220 --> 00:20:59,220
My logic worked!

512
00:21:00,220 --> 00:21:02,220
It's because they didn't wrap up!

513
00:21:05,220 --> 00:21:08,220
What does IOC mean?

514
00:21:08,220 --> 00:21:09,220
What's the IOU?

515
00:21:10,220 --> 00:21:11,220
Get wrecked.

516
00:21:11,220 --> 00:21:12,220
Get wrecked.

517
00:21:12,220 --> 00:21:14,220
Get wrecked, weebs.

518
00:21:14,220 --> 00:21:17,220
Well, I've never heard of IOC.

519
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:18,220
Right.

520
00:21:18,220 --> 00:21:21,220
International Organization of Challengers.

521
00:21:21,220 --> 00:21:24,220
That sounds like some weird Guinness World Book of Records.

522
00:21:24,220 --> 00:21:26,220
International Olympic Committee.

523
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:28,220
Oh, that sounds much more likely.

524
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:30,220
International Order...

525
00:21:30,220 --> 00:21:31,220
Oh, okay.

526
00:21:31,220 --> 00:21:32,220
It's Olympics.

527
00:21:32,220 --> 00:21:34,220
A is going to be the right answer.

528
00:21:34,220 --> 00:21:35,220
It's Olympics.

529
00:21:35,220 --> 00:21:37,220
I'm literally Skippity-Doodle-Dun.

530
00:21:37,220 --> 00:21:38,220
Yeah, sorry.

531
00:21:38,220 --> 00:21:39,220
That was too easy.

532
00:21:39,220 --> 00:21:41,220
He's a piece of enthusiasm.

533
00:21:41,220 --> 00:21:44,220
With which branch of the arts

534
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:46,220
is Vincent Van Gogh most associated?

535
00:21:46,220 --> 00:21:48,220
Pain and I.

536
00:21:48,220 --> 00:21:51,220
And then he chopped his wee ear lobe off.

537
00:21:51,220 --> 00:21:52,220
That's right.

538
00:21:52,220 --> 00:21:53,220
He did a wee pain,

539
00:21:53,220 --> 00:21:54,220
and he was like,

540
00:21:54,220 --> 00:21:55,220
oh, you know what,

541
00:21:55,220 --> 00:21:58,220
they make this a masterpiece come together.

542
00:21:58,220 --> 00:21:59,220
Chopping my ear lobe off.

543
00:21:59,220 --> 00:22:01,220
All right, all right, all right.

544
00:22:02,220 --> 00:22:03,220
Oh.

545
00:22:04,220 --> 00:22:06,220
Yes, that's my final...

546
00:22:06,220 --> 00:22:07,220
Oh, okay.

547
00:22:07,220 --> 00:22:09,220
I'm actually so smart.

548
00:22:09,220 --> 00:22:11,220
If...

549
00:22:11,220 --> 00:22:13,220
Where are you,

550
00:22:13,220 --> 00:22:16,220
if you're ordering a Wienerschnitzel?

551
00:22:16,220 --> 00:22:18,220
Deutschland?

552
00:22:18,220 --> 00:22:20,220
Ja?

553
00:22:20,220 --> 00:22:22,220
A Wienerschnitzel?

554
00:22:22,220 --> 00:22:25,220
How do you say it in German?

555
00:22:25,220 --> 00:22:28,220
And now to the most important question of all.

556
00:22:28,220 --> 00:22:30,220
Surely it's not a misnomer,

557
00:22:30,220 --> 00:22:31,220
and it was like, oh, by the way,

558
00:22:31,220 --> 00:22:32,220
it was actually created in Austria,

559
00:22:32,220 --> 00:22:34,220
because they speak German in Austria as well.

560
00:22:34,220 --> 00:22:36,220
Surely, kopium.

561
00:22:36,220 --> 00:22:39,220
Kopium before it's a fucking fake out.

562
00:22:40,220 --> 00:22:42,220
Um, okay.

563
00:22:42,220 --> 00:22:45,220
Ah, it's a fake out!

564
00:22:45,220 --> 00:22:47,220
They speak...

565
00:22:47,220 --> 00:22:50,220
They speak German in Austria.

566
00:22:50,220 --> 00:22:52,220
Why?

567
00:22:52,220 --> 00:22:55,220
A fucking Wienerschnitzel is a most stereotypical

568
00:22:55,220 --> 00:22:59,220
like, October face thing ever.

569
00:23:01,220 --> 00:23:03,220
Why?

570
00:23:03,220 --> 00:23:05,220
Why are all of these things

571
00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:07,220
fucking like, tee-hee, tee-hee?

572
00:23:07,220 --> 00:23:09,220
Right, what level are we on?

573
00:23:09,220 --> 00:23:11,220
Oh, my God, we're on number six.

574
00:23:11,220 --> 00:23:13,220
Okay.

575
00:23:13,220 --> 00:23:14,220
Okay, we can do it.

576
00:23:14,220 --> 00:23:16,220
We can do it, we're on number six.

577
00:23:16,220 --> 00:23:19,220
I love number six.

578
00:23:19,220 --> 00:23:21,220
October face is Dutch.

579
00:23:21,220 --> 00:23:22,220
Okay, that's the...

580
00:23:22,220 --> 00:23:23,220
Oh, God, okay.

581
00:23:23,220 --> 00:23:25,220
Right.

582
00:23:25,220 --> 00:23:27,220
I can do number six, okay?

583
00:23:29,220 --> 00:23:30,220
Ah!

584
00:23:30,220 --> 00:23:32,220
Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.

585
00:23:32,220 --> 00:23:34,220
That was, uh-huh, I even felt that.

586
00:23:34,220 --> 00:23:36,220
That's got a little kick to it.

587
00:23:36,220 --> 00:23:38,220
It's got a little kick to it.

588
00:23:38,220 --> 00:23:39,220
It's okay.

589
00:23:39,220 --> 00:23:41,220
It's okay, got a little kick to it.

590
00:23:41,220 --> 00:23:42,220
It's just...

591
00:23:42,220 --> 00:23:44,220
It's just in the season, you know?

592
00:23:44,220 --> 00:23:46,220
But the food is good overall.

593
00:23:46,220 --> 00:23:48,220
Oh, right, normal.

594
00:23:48,220 --> 00:23:51,220
No time for fucking schnitzel, yeah, pal.

595
00:23:51,220 --> 00:23:54,220
Oh, I'd like one Wienerschnitzel, please.

596
00:23:54,220 --> 00:23:56,220
Oh, you must be in Austria.

597
00:23:56,220 --> 00:23:58,220
Excuse me, I thought it took a plane to Berlin.

598
00:23:58,220 --> 00:23:59,220
What's going on here?

599
00:23:59,220 --> 00:24:00,220
Where did I go?

600
00:24:00,220 --> 00:24:02,220
I disappeared.

601
00:24:02,220 --> 00:24:04,220
Fucking Wienerschnitzel.

602
00:24:04,220 --> 00:24:06,220
I'm gonna go a bed mad over Wienerschnitzel tonight.

603
00:24:06,220 --> 00:24:08,220
I just thought you should know.

604
00:24:08,220 --> 00:24:10,220
Shawnee, please don't make it too high.

605
00:24:10,220 --> 00:24:12,220
Just do like three or four wrong answers.

606
00:24:12,220 --> 00:24:14,220
Subtitles?

607
00:24:14,220 --> 00:24:16,220
No, don't put it up more.

608
00:24:16,220 --> 00:24:18,220
Oh, I wanted to do it on ten.

609
00:24:18,220 --> 00:24:20,220
Is that bad?

610
00:24:20,220 --> 00:24:22,220
Or is that weird?

611
00:24:22,220 --> 00:24:23,220
Crank it to the max.

612
00:24:23,220 --> 00:24:25,220
Yeah, I was gonna go up to the max.

613
00:24:25,220 --> 00:24:28,220
And then I put it back down to, like, what I can handle.

614
00:24:29,220 --> 00:24:34,220
Wien is the capital of Austria.

615
00:24:34,220 --> 00:24:35,220
Who played...

616
00:24:35,220 --> 00:24:36,220
Oh, my God.

617
00:24:36,220 --> 00:24:38,220
Which actress played Wonder Woman?

618
00:24:38,220 --> 00:24:40,220
Galal Gadot.

619
00:24:40,220 --> 00:24:42,220
Yeah.

620
00:24:42,220 --> 00:24:45,220
Galal Gadot.

621
00:24:45,220 --> 00:24:50,220
Haley Berry was stormed in X-Men.

622
00:24:50,220 --> 00:24:52,220
Scarlet Wood, Johansson was Black Widow.

623
00:24:52,220 --> 00:24:57,220
I'm sorry, Charlize, stay her on, but I don't know who you are.

624
00:24:57,220 --> 00:24:59,220
Oh, yeah.

625
00:24:59,220 --> 00:25:01,220
It's bigger, too.

626
00:25:01,220 --> 00:25:06,220
How are the continents represented on the Olympic flag?

627
00:25:06,220 --> 00:25:08,220
By the circles?

628
00:25:08,220 --> 00:25:10,220
By the rings?

629
00:25:10,220 --> 00:25:12,220
Okay, by the rings.

630
00:25:12,220 --> 00:25:14,220
I'm gonna go with by the rings.

631
00:25:14,220 --> 00:25:16,220
Thank you, my good sir.

632
00:25:16,220 --> 00:25:18,220
Oh, yes.

633
00:25:18,220 --> 00:25:21,220
Haley Berry was also captain.

634
00:25:21,220 --> 00:25:24,220
Ah, what musical group album

635
00:25:24,220 --> 00:25:27,220
did you put in Rumors Tusk and Behind the Mask?

636
00:25:27,220 --> 00:25:29,220
Refland's Kanachi, I don't...

637
00:25:29,220 --> 00:25:32,220
Oh, Fleetwood Mac.

638
00:25:32,220 --> 00:25:34,220
Mac, it's Fleetwood Mac, okay.

639
00:25:34,220 --> 00:25:36,220
Let's take a deep breath.

640
00:25:36,220 --> 00:25:38,220
I'm confident that it's C.

641
00:25:38,220 --> 00:25:40,220
Okay, I was lucky that they gave me the answer like that.

642
00:25:40,220 --> 00:25:43,220
If it didn't give me the answer like that, it was ogre.

643
00:25:43,220 --> 00:25:45,220
It was actually ogre.

644
00:25:45,220 --> 00:25:47,220
But they gave me it like that, so I'll take it.

645
00:25:47,220 --> 00:25:52,220
What is Usain Bolt's nickname?

646
00:25:52,220 --> 00:25:54,220
I want to say lightning bolt.

647
00:25:56,220 --> 00:25:58,220
I want to say running bolt, that's shit.

648
00:25:58,220 --> 00:26:00,220
Speedy bolt. Super bolt.

649
00:26:00,220 --> 00:26:02,220
Oh, look, here he comes.

650
00:26:02,220 --> 00:26:04,220
It's running bolt.

651
00:26:04,220 --> 00:26:06,220
No, like lightning bolt. It has to be.

652
00:26:06,220 --> 00:26:08,220
I have faith.

653
00:26:08,220 --> 00:26:10,220
Yeah, okay, thank goodness.

654
00:26:10,220 --> 00:26:12,220
I was gonna say, I was like, oh, that's weird.

655
00:26:12,220 --> 00:26:15,220
Which Olympic symbol is passed from hand to hand

656
00:26:15,220 --> 00:26:17,220
during the opening ceremony?

657
00:26:17,220 --> 00:26:20,220
Ah, touch. It's lit up like the sky.

658
00:26:21,220 --> 00:26:23,220
They're all shit, buddy.

659
00:26:23,220 --> 00:26:25,220
Oh my God, we made a thousand.

660
00:26:25,220 --> 00:26:27,220
I just got an achievement for the first time

661
00:26:27,220 --> 00:26:30,220
to reach 5,000, 1,000 quid.

662
00:26:30,220 --> 00:26:32,220
That's how bad I've been playing.

663
00:26:35,220 --> 00:26:41,220
On television, Oz Clark is best known as a egg.

664
00:26:41,220 --> 00:26:44,220
Who is Oz Clark?

665
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:46,220
Identify yourself.

666
00:26:46,220 --> 00:26:49,220
DIY horse racing?

667
00:26:50,220 --> 00:26:51,220
Fashion?

668
00:26:51,220 --> 00:26:52,220
Wayne.

669
00:26:52,220 --> 00:26:54,220
It has to be DIY.

670
00:26:54,220 --> 00:26:56,220
It has to be DIY.

671
00:26:57,220 --> 00:26:59,220
Horse racing?

672
00:26:59,220 --> 00:27:01,220
Is this an Australian?

673
00:27:03,220 --> 00:27:04,220
Oz Clark.

674
00:27:04,220 --> 00:27:08,220
Right, Clark rhymes with a hammer.

675
00:27:08,220 --> 00:27:10,220
Okay, DIY.

676
00:27:10,220 --> 00:27:12,220
I don't know.

677
00:27:12,220 --> 00:27:14,220
You can't be an expert on TV about

678
00:27:14,220 --> 00:27:16,220
Wayne or fashion or horse racing.

679
00:27:16,220 --> 00:27:18,220
That doesn't make sense.

680
00:27:19,220 --> 00:27:21,220
That's my final answer.

681
00:27:21,220 --> 00:27:23,220
I love the way the horse...

682
00:27:23,220 --> 00:27:25,220
I say giddy up to the horsey.

683
00:27:25,220 --> 00:27:27,220
That doesn't make any sense.

684
00:27:30,220 --> 00:27:31,220
Who?

685
00:27:31,220 --> 00:27:32,220
What?

686
00:27:32,220 --> 00:27:33,220
No, I'll be faster.

687
00:27:33,220 --> 00:27:36,220
Oh, I'm an expert in Wayne, by the way.

688
00:27:36,220 --> 00:27:37,220
Wayne?

689
00:27:37,220 --> 00:27:39,220
It's just fermented grapes.

690
00:27:39,220 --> 00:27:41,220
Are you joking?

691
00:27:41,220 --> 00:27:43,220
Who was supposed to know that?

692
00:27:43,220 --> 00:27:45,220
Oh, I got a whole 40 points for that, though.

693
00:27:45,220 --> 00:27:47,220
Totally didn't...

694
00:27:47,220 --> 00:27:48,220
He's Brett?

695
00:27:48,220 --> 00:27:50,220
Oh, my God.

696
00:27:50,220 --> 00:27:53,220
Literally, like, oh, I'm so good at tasting Wayne.

697
00:27:53,220 --> 00:27:54,220
That aroma up my nose.

698
00:27:54,220 --> 00:27:56,220
Like, what you on about?

699
00:27:56,220 --> 00:27:58,220
It's just fucking nasty drink.

700
00:27:58,220 --> 00:28:01,220
Right, are we ready for level seven?

701
00:28:01,220 --> 00:28:02,220
Okay.

702
00:28:02,220 --> 00:28:04,220
I can do it.

703
00:28:04,220 --> 00:28:06,220
Don't forget the lifelines I showed.

704
00:28:06,220 --> 00:28:07,220
Okay, ready?

705
00:28:07,220 --> 00:28:09,220
Three...

706
00:28:09,220 --> 00:28:10,220
Two...

707
00:28:10,220 --> 00:28:11,220
One...

708
00:28:12,220 --> 00:28:13,220
Okay!

709
00:28:13,220 --> 00:28:14,220
Okay!

710
00:28:14,220 --> 00:28:17,220
I'm going up to the number eight now.

711
00:28:17,220 --> 00:28:19,220
There's only ten levels as far as I'm aware.

712
00:28:19,220 --> 00:28:23,220
Unless we're about to unlock the secret DLC levels on the damn thing.

713
00:28:23,220 --> 00:28:24,220
But...

714
00:28:24,220 --> 00:28:25,220
Oh, we're doing it!

715
00:28:25,220 --> 00:28:26,220
We're doing it!

716
00:28:26,220 --> 00:28:27,220
We're doing it!

717
00:28:27,220 --> 00:28:29,220
I'm going to move it around on the next part of my thigh

718
00:28:29,220 --> 00:28:31,220
because I don't want any issues.

719
00:28:32,220 --> 00:28:34,220
Okay, normal.

720
00:28:34,220 --> 00:28:36,220
No time mark because I don't want to feel rushed.

721
00:28:36,220 --> 00:28:38,220
Next...

722
00:28:38,220 --> 00:28:39,220
Yulie.

723
00:28:39,220 --> 00:28:43,220
We're going all out on Lili and Yulie.

724
00:28:43,220 --> 00:28:45,220
Car battery DLC.

725
00:28:45,220 --> 00:28:47,220
Hack it and go 15 star.

726
00:28:47,220 --> 00:28:49,220
That's terrible.

727
00:28:49,220 --> 00:28:50,220
Terrible.

728
00:28:50,220 --> 00:28:52,220
Put that on me.

729
00:28:52,220 --> 00:28:54,220
I don't know if the game...

730
00:28:54,220 --> 00:28:56,220
Is the game in me loud enough?

731
00:28:56,220 --> 00:28:57,220
Like, is it a bit confidential?

732
00:28:57,220 --> 00:28:58,220
Anyway.

733
00:28:58,220 --> 00:29:03,220
What phrase is often used to describe senior company executives?

734
00:29:03,220 --> 00:29:06,220
Big nasty bastard.

735
00:29:07,220 --> 00:29:11,220
Big nasty bastard hedge fund fuckers.

736
00:29:11,220 --> 00:29:13,220
Um, sorry.

737
00:29:13,220 --> 00:29:16,220
I believe they're referred to fat cats.

738
00:29:16,220 --> 00:29:19,220
I'll take fat cats for ten, please.

739
00:29:19,220 --> 00:29:20,220
I know you are waiting.

740
00:29:20,220 --> 00:29:21,220
You may get lucky.

741
00:29:21,220 --> 00:29:23,220
You've got it.

742
00:29:24,220 --> 00:29:27,220
It's time to move on to a new question.

743
00:29:27,220 --> 00:29:33,220
Who gave birth to a boy named Deacon Philippe in the fall of 2003?

744
00:29:34,220 --> 00:29:38,220
Reese Witherspoon is my guess based on what's popping up.

745
00:29:38,220 --> 00:29:39,220
Yeah, okay.

746
00:29:39,220 --> 00:29:40,220
Grease Sugarspoon.

747
00:29:40,220 --> 00:29:42,220
One that's incredibly rude.

748
00:29:42,220 --> 00:29:43,220
But I'll take it.

749
00:29:43,220 --> 00:29:44,220
Thank God.

750
00:29:44,220 --> 00:29:47,220
I'm going to start calling them the big bunnies.

751
00:29:47,220 --> 00:29:51,220
I took the time I needed, but at least the results are there.

752
00:29:51,220 --> 00:29:53,220
Eh, right.

753
00:29:55,220 --> 00:29:59,220
Which Italian cheese used on people stretches...

754
00:29:59,220 --> 00:30:00,220
Used on people?

755
00:30:00,220 --> 00:30:01,220
Oh my God.

756
00:30:01,220 --> 00:30:04,220
People that hit each of our people?

757
00:30:04,220 --> 00:30:05,220
Mozzarella.

758
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:06,220
Mozzarella.

759
00:30:06,220 --> 00:30:07,220
I stretch it.

760
00:30:07,220 --> 00:30:08,220
It's got gooey.

761
00:30:08,220 --> 00:30:10,220
It's got gooey on the pizza.

762
00:30:13,220 --> 00:30:14,220
Thank you.

763
00:30:14,220 --> 00:30:15,220
Okay, clap, clap, clap.

764
00:30:15,220 --> 00:30:16,220
Go clap.

765
00:30:16,220 --> 00:30:17,220
Thank you.

766
00:30:18,220 --> 00:30:24,220
What year appears in the title of Stanley Kubrick's film subtitled?

767
00:30:24,220 --> 00:30:27,220
I think it's 2001, the Space Odyssey?

768
00:30:27,220 --> 00:30:29,220
Well, it's death.

769
00:30:29,220 --> 00:30:31,220
Wait, is it?

770
00:30:32,220 --> 00:30:35,220
2001, the Space Odyssey?

771
00:30:36,220 --> 00:30:37,220
2000...

772
00:30:37,220 --> 00:30:40,220
1979, the Space Odyssey.

773
00:30:40,220 --> 00:30:42,220
1945, the Space Odyssey.

774
00:30:43,220 --> 00:30:45,220
1984, the Space Odyssey.

775
00:30:45,220 --> 00:30:47,220
No, it's 2001.

776
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:48,220
Yeah.

777
00:30:49,220 --> 00:30:51,220
2000, because it was supposed to be set in the future.

778
00:30:51,220 --> 00:30:52,220
I've actually not seen that film.

779
00:30:52,220 --> 00:30:54,220
I wanted to watch it, were you?

780
00:30:54,220 --> 00:30:56,220
But I don't have a chance to watch it.

781
00:30:56,220 --> 00:30:58,220
Well, we're watching stuff soon.

782
00:30:58,220 --> 00:30:59,220
Yeah, okay.

783
00:30:59,220 --> 00:31:00,220
Right, safe.

784
00:31:01,220 --> 00:31:02,220
Get ready.

785
00:31:02,220 --> 00:31:03,220
I'm not getting shocked.

786
00:31:03,220 --> 00:31:04,220
I'm not getting shocked.

787
00:31:04,220 --> 00:31:06,220
Our team of editors...

788
00:31:06,220 --> 00:31:07,220
I do.

789
00:31:07,220 --> 00:31:11,220
Which of these is the device used with a computer to digitize...

790
00:31:13,220 --> 00:31:14,220
Is that a joke?

791
00:31:14,220 --> 00:31:16,220
Or is this real?

792
00:31:16,220 --> 00:31:19,220
Is this what they consider technology questions?

793
00:31:19,220 --> 00:31:20,220
Like, a scanner?

794
00:31:20,220 --> 00:31:24,220
Do you know what the scooping room is used for?

795
00:31:24,220 --> 00:31:27,220
For scooping, you fucking idiot!

796
00:31:27,220 --> 00:31:28,220
What?

797
00:31:28,220 --> 00:31:31,220
That's a FNAF reference for you.

798
00:31:32,220 --> 00:31:33,220
A zoomer.

799
00:31:33,220 --> 00:31:35,220
Oh my god, we made a thousand quid!

800
00:31:35,220 --> 00:31:38,220
This is the farthest I've ever gone.

801
00:31:38,220 --> 00:31:41,220
Zoomer is a U of PIC scanner, by the way.

802
00:31:45,220 --> 00:31:49,220
Everyone knows the Empire's Thai hunters.

803
00:31:49,220 --> 00:31:51,220
What does Thai mean?

804
00:31:51,220 --> 00:31:52,220
Huh?

805
00:31:54,220 --> 00:31:55,220
What?

806
00:31:58,220 --> 00:32:00,220
Everyone knows the Empire.

807
00:32:00,220 --> 00:32:02,220
Who the fuck is the Empire, buddy?

808
00:32:02,220 --> 00:32:03,220
Star Wars?

809
00:32:04,220 --> 00:32:05,220
What?

810
00:32:07,220 --> 00:32:10,220
The only Empire I'm aware of is Star Wars,

811
00:32:10,220 --> 00:32:13,220
and last time I checked, we defeated the baddies.

812
00:32:13,220 --> 00:32:14,220
So...

813
00:32:14,220 --> 00:32:15,220
What's going on?

814
00:32:16,220 --> 00:32:19,220
Empire's Thai hunters.

815
00:32:19,220 --> 00:32:20,220
Who's...

816
00:32:20,220 --> 00:32:23,220
Twin Iron Engines,

817
00:32:23,220 --> 00:32:26,220
Task Ion Energy,

818
00:32:26,220 --> 00:32:28,220
Task Industry Engineer.

819
00:32:28,220 --> 00:32:30,220
The Empire's Task Industry Engineer.

820
00:32:30,220 --> 00:32:32,220
What?!

821
00:32:34,220 --> 00:32:37,220
Is that a reference to the Roman Empire?

822
00:32:38,220 --> 00:32:40,220
Yeah, we decommissioned them.

823
00:32:40,220 --> 00:32:42,220
Okay, right, I'll take that hint.

824
00:32:42,220 --> 00:32:45,220
If we decommissioned them, then it's engines.

825
00:32:45,220 --> 00:32:47,220
Whatever the F that is.

826
00:32:47,220 --> 00:32:49,220
Whose Empire are we even referring to?

827
00:32:49,220 --> 00:32:51,220
Task Ion Energy.

828
00:32:51,220 --> 00:32:54,220
No, if we decommissioned them, it's engines.

829
00:32:55,220 --> 00:32:58,220
The Empire's two engine hunters.

830
00:32:58,220 --> 00:33:00,220
I don't know why that's specific though,

831
00:33:00,220 --> 00:33:02,220
and why you need to mention that.

832
00:33:02,220 --> 00:33:04,220
What even is that?

833
00:33:04,220 --> 00:33:06,220
What even is that?

834
00:33:06,220 --> 00:33:08,220
Who would even get that question?

835
00:33:08,220 --> 00:33:10,220
Sorry, I feel like completely cheatsy doodles.

836
00:33:10,220 --> 00:33:12,220
Okay, I've got a 2,000 quid thought.

837
00:33:13,220 --> 00:33:15,220
What is the name?

838
00:33:15,220 --> 00:33:16,220
Oh, no.

839
00:33:16,220 --> 00:33:17,220
Diny's Diny.

840
00:33:19,220 --> 00:33:20,220
Uh...

841
00:33:20,220 --> 00:33:22,220
Just gonna warn you, don't watch...

842
00:33:22,220 --> 00:33:24,220
Oh, no, is my freaking audio broken?

843
00:33:26,220 --> 00:33:27,220
Oops.

844
00:33:27,220 --> 00:33:28,220
Is Brian...

845
00:33:28,220 --> 00:33:29,220
Brian!

846
00:33:29,220 --> 00:33:31,220
Nothing happens the whole movie.

847
00:33:31,220 --> 00:33:34,220
There's a six-minute scene with only loud breathing.

848
00:33:34,220 --> 00:33:36,220
Is there a...wait, hold on.

849
00:33:36,220 --> 00:33:38,220
Brian, can you say that again?

850
00:33:38,220 --> 00:33:39,220
You got a little shy, buddy.

851
00:33:39,220 --> 00:33:41,220
Brian, go again.

852
00:33:41,220 --> 00:33:42,220
Are you squiddin' me right now?

853
00:33:42,220 --> 00:33:43,220
Alright, Brian, tell us what you...

854
00:33:43,220 --> 00:33:44,220
Tell...what are you preachin'?

855
00:33:44,220 --> 00:33:47,220
Just gonna warn you, don't watch 2001.

856
00:33:47,220 --> 00:33:49,220
A space odyssey on stream.

857
00:33:49,220 --> 00:33:52,220
It's the most boring movie existence.

858
00:33:52,220 --> 00:33:54,220
It has some cool camera work,

859
00:33:54,220 --> 00:33:56,220
but is awful to watch since basically

860
00:33:56,220 --> 00:33:58,220
nothing happens the whole movie.

861
00:33:58,220 --> 00:34:01,220
There's a six-minute scene with only loud breathing.

862
00:34:06,220 --> 00:34:08,220
That's what space odyssey's about.

863
00:34:08,220 --> 00:34:09,220
Thank you, Diny's Diny.

864
00:34:09,220 --> 00:34:11,220
Okay, we ain't watchin' Diny's Diny.

865
00:34:12,220 --> 00:34:15,220
What is the name of Copper's owner

866
00:34:15,220 --> 00:34:17,220
and the fox and the...

867
00:34:18,220 --> 00:34:20,220
I think it's Tweet.

868
00:34:22,220 --> 00:34:24,220
I want to say it's Tweet.

869
00:34:25,220 --> 00:34:26,220
Tweet?

870
00:34:26,220 --> 00:34:30,220
Because Amos Salade is Spanish, right?

871
00:34:30,220 --> 00:34:33,220
And Fox and the Hound isn't set for Spain.

872
00:34:33,220 --> 00:34:35,220
So Amos say Tweet.

873
00:34:35,220 --> 00:34:37,220
I'm confident that it's C.

874
00:34:37,220 --> 00:34:38,220
Okay, we're PDC.

875
00:34:38,220 --> 00:34:40,220
Let me know. Let me know what you think.

876
00:34:40,220 --> 00:34:41,220
Why?

877
00:34:41,220 --> 00:34:43,220
It's not even a Spanish film!

878
00:34:43,220 --> 00:34:45,220
Please, if I look up Salade

879
00:34:45,220 --> 00:34:49,220
and Salade's surname, origin,

880
00:34:49,220 --> 00:34:51,220
I'm actually gonna pop.

881
00:34:51,220 --> 00:34:53,220
It's not set in Spain!

882
00:34:53,220 --> 00:34:55,220
It's a Saxon...

883
00:34:55,220 --> 00:34:56,220
Oh!

884
00:34:56,220 --> 00:34:58,220
It's fuckin' English!

885
00:34:59,220 --> 00:35:00,220
Fuck!

886
00:35:01,220 --> 00:35:03,220
It's an English spawned name.

887
00:35:03,220 --> 00:35:05,220
It says Saxon on the web.

888
00:35:06,220 --> 00:35:07,220
Okay.

889
00:35:07,220 --> 00:35:09,220
Okay, it's fine.

890
00:35:09,220 --> 00:35:10,220
It's fine. It's fine.

891
00:35:10,220 --> 00:35:11,220
It's fine.

892
00:35:11,220 --> 00:35:13,220
Ready? This is number eight.

893
00:35:13,220 --> 00:35:15,220
Okay, number eight.

894
00:35:15,220 --> 00:35:16,220
Okay.

895
00:35:16,220 --> 00:35:17,220
Okay.

896
00:35:17,220 --> 00:35:18,220
Set up for this one.

897
00:35:18,220 --> 00:35:19,220
Okay.

898
00:35:19,220 --> 00:35:20,220
Ready?

899
00:35:20,220 --> 00:35:23,220
Three, two, one...

900
00:35:23,220 --> 00:35:24,220
Okay!

901
00:35:24,220 --> 00:35:25,220
Okay!

902
00:35:25,220 --> 00:35:26,220
Okay!

903
00:35:26,220 --> 00:35:27,220
Okay!

904
00:35:27,220 --> 00:35:28,220
That is...

905
00:35:28,220 --> 00:35:29,220
That is a...

906
00:35:29,220 --> 00:35:30,220
That is a Chocorini.

907
00:35:30,220 --> 00:35:31,220
I have to admit that is...

908
00:35:31,220 --> 00:35:32,220
You'll never guess what.

909
00:35:32,220 --> 00:35:34,220
It's actually a Chocorini.

910
00:35:34,220 --> 00:35:35,220
Quite literally.

911
00:35:35,220 --> 00:35:36,220
Okay.

912
00:35:36,220 --> 00:35:38,220
Okay, we're going up to nine.

913
00:35:38,220 --> 00:35:39,220
We're going up to nine.

914
00:35:39,220 --> 00:35:40,220
It's nine.

915
00:35:40,220 --> 00:35:42,220
No, I love that.

916
00:35:42,220 --> 00:35:44,220
It's so dumb that I don't get anywhere in this game.

917
00:35:44,220 --> 00:35:45,220
No!

918
00:35:45,220 --> 00:35:47,220
It's hilarious.

919
00:35:47,220 --> 00:35:49,220
It's hilarious.

920
00:35:50,220 --> 00:35:52,220
Fuckin' Saladi.

921
00:35:52,220 --> 00:35:54,220
I've never heard that surname.

922
00:35:55,220 --> 00:35:57,220
Shock and behavior.

923
00:35:57,220 --> 00:36:00,220
From how terrible my freakin' knowledge is on anything.

924
00:36:00,220 --> 00:36:04,220
I think I'm gonna have to start taking out categories that didn't even came.

925
00:36:06,220 --> 00:36:07,220
Okay.

926
00:36:07,220 --> 00:36:10,220
Which of these is an informal name for a party?

927
00:36:10,220 --> 00:36:11,220
A crash.

928
00:36:13,220 --> 00:36:14,220
A crash.

929
00:36:15,220 --> 00:36:16,220
I'm sure of it.

930
00:36:16,220 --> 00:36:17,220
It has to be a crash.

931
00:36:17,220 --> 00:36:18,220
Like, oh.

932
00:36:19,220 --> 00:36:20,220
A bash?

933
00:36:20,220 --> 00:36:21,220
That's my final name.

934
00:36:21,220 --> 00:36:22,220
Oh no, is it bash?

935
00:36:22,220 --> 00:36:23,220
Is it bash?

936
00:36:23,220 --> 00:36:24,220
Hold on.

937
00:36:25,220 --> 00:36:26,220
Oh my god!

938
00:36:26,220 --> 00:36:27,220
Right!

939
00:36:27,220 --> 00:36:28,220
Right!

940
00:36:28,220 --> 00:36:29,220
Right!

941
00:36:29,220 --> 00:36:30,220
Right!

942
00:36:30,220 --> 00:36:31,220
A bash.

943
00:36:31,220 --> 00:36:32,220
Go for a birthday bash.

944
00:36:32,220 --> 00:36:33,220
You idiot!

945
00:36:33,220 --> 00:36:34,220
Right.

946
00:36:34,220 --> 00:36:35,220
Okay.

947
00:36:35,220 --> 00:36:36,220
Nine.

948
00:36:36,220 --> 00:36:37,220
Nine.

949
00:36:37,220 --> 00:36:38,220
I'm sorry.

950
00:36:38,220 --> 00:36:39,220
I'm sorry.

951
00:36:39,220 --> 00:36:41,220
I'm literally a birthday bash.

952
00:36:41,220 --> 00:36:42,220
A crash bash.

953
00:36:43,220 --> 00:36:44,220
Okay.

954
00:36:45,220 --> 00:36:46,220
Okay.

955
00:36:46,220 --> 00:36:47,220
Okay.

956
00:36:47,220 --> 00:36:49,220
I'm a bit nervous about number nine.

957
00:36:49,220 --> 00:36:50,220
I'm gonna be honest.

958
00:36:50,220 --> 00:36:53,220
If this is literally the second-last level before...

959
00:36:55,220 --> 00:36:56,220
Okay.

960
00:36:56,220 --> 00:36:57,220
Okay.

961
00:36:57,220 --> 00:36:58,220
Three, two, one.

962
00:37:00,220 --> 00:37:01,220
Oh my god!

963
00:37:01,220 --> 00:37:02,220
That is so sore.

964
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:03,220
Don't ever use this on your pets.

965
00:37:03,220 --> 00:37:04,220
What the fuck?

966
00:37:04,220 --> 00:37:05,220
Are you squidding me right now?

967
00:37:05,220 --> 00:37:06,220
That's fucked.

968
00:37:06,220 --> 00:37:08,220
Don't ever use short-quality on your pets.

969
00:37:11,220 --> 00:37:13,220
Oh wait, what does that mean?

970
00:37:13,220 --> 00:37:15,220
Your braid of Frankenstein.

971
00:37:15,220 --> 00:37:17,220
Wait, what's the braid of Frankenstein?

972
00:37:17,220 --> 00:37:18,220
Stop!

973
00:37:18,220 --> 00:37:19,220
What's the braid of Frankenstein?

974
00:37:19,220 --> 00:37:20,220
What's that mean?

975
00:37:20,220 --> 00:37:22,220
Oh, what does that mean, Adam?

976
00:37:22,220 --> 00:37:23,220
Thank you, the bitty lord.

977
00:37:23,220 --> 00:37:24,220
Ninety-six.

978
00:37:24,220 --> 00:37:26,220
Ninety-six is the bitty lord backwards.

979
00:37:26,220 --> 00:37:27,220
What name?

980
00:37:28,220 --> 00:37:30,220
Oh my god, the hair!

981
00:37:30,220 --> 00:37:32,220
Okay, that's actually a really good reference.

982
00:37:32,220 --> 00:37:33,220
Sorry.

983
00:37:33,220 --> 00:37:34,220
Hold on, let me...

984
00:37:34,220 --> 00:37:35,220
That's such a good reference.

985
00:37:35,220 --> 00:37:36,220
Her hair's up.

986
00:37:36,220 --> 00:37:37,220
Okay, that's really good.

987
00:37:37,220 --> 00:37:38,220
I'll give you that.

988
00:37:38,220 --> 00:37:40,220
Okay, we're on level ten now.

989
00:37:40,220 --> 00:37:41,220
Copy on.

990
00:37:42,220 --> 00:37:45,220
Oh, that's got a last and tingle on my leg.

991
00:37:45,220 --> 00:37:48,220
I'm gonna be honest, I can actually still kind of feel that.

992
00:37:49,220 --> 00:37:50,220
Right.

993
00:37:50,220 --> 00:37:53,220
I will start swapping the stuff around once I've reached max level,

994
00:37:53,220 --> 00:37:54,220
and we're gonna go down a bit.

995
00:37:54,220 --> 00:37:56,220
Are you squidding me right now?

996
00:37:56,220 --> 00:37:57,220
Okay.

997
00:38:01,220 --> 00:38:02,220
Oh!

998
00:38:04,220 --> 00:38:05,220
Oh!

999
00:38:10,220 --> 00:38:14,220
Okay.

1000
00:38:14,220 --> 00:38:15,220
Okay.

1001
00:38:15,220 --> 00:38:17,220
Thank you, Dan Sullivan, for the tip.

1002
00:38:17,220 --> 00:38:18,220
Refunds have it.

1003
00:38:18,220 --> 00:38:19,220
I can't believe it.

1004
00:38:19,220 --> 00:38:21,220
The reflings are infighting!

1005
00:38:21,220 --> 00:38:22,220
That's true.

1006
00:38:22,220 --> 00:38:23,220
Thank you for becoming a member.

1007
00:38:23,220 --> 00:38:25,220
Please enjoy the perks.

1008
00:38:25,220 --> 00:38:27,220
I don't know how I'm supposed to shock myself

1009
00:38:27,220 --> 00:38:29,220
on the ASMR stream after this stream.

1010
00:38:29,220 --> 00:38:31,220
It's not even possible.

1011
00:38:31,220 --> 00:38:33,220
It's not even possible.

1012
00:38:33,220 --> 00:38:35,220
How am I supposed to quietly shock myself?

1013
00:38:35,220 --> 00:38:37,220
I have no idea.

1014
00:38:38,220 --> 00:38:40,220
I have absolutely no idea.

1015
00:38:41,220 --> 00:38:46,220
Which of these is most likely to be marketed as lead free?

1016
00:38:46,220 --> 00:38:47,220
Oh.

1017
00:38:48,220 --> 00:38:49,220
Well.

1018
00:38:50,220 --> 00:38:51,220
Well then, well then.

1019
00:38:51,220 --> 00:38:53,220
Did we not discover that it was a lot more lead

1020
00:38:53,220 --> 00:38:57,220
than we thought in the official pipeline of things?

1021
00:38:58,220 --> 00:39:02,220
Gee, I wonder which massive fucking mega corporations

1022
00:39:02,220 --> 00:39:04,220
wanted to hide that news from the people.

1023
00:39:04,220 --> 00:39:08,220
Which household object is most likely to have a hob on top?

1024
00:39:08,220 --> 00:39:09,220
A cooker?

1025
00:39:09,220 --> 00:39:11,220
Aye, a cooker.

1026
00:39:13,220 --> 00:39:14,220
Okay, a cooker.

1027
00:39:14,220 --> 00:39:15,220
Any hobbers?

1028
00:39:15,220 --> 00:39:17,220
Anyone got their hob knobs out?

1029
00:39:17,220 --> 00:39:19,220
I've got my hob knob out.

1030
00:39:19,220 --> 00:39:22,220
Hob knob is a biscuit in the UK before anyone's like,

1031
00:39:22,220 --> 00:39:23,220
what are you on about?

1032
00:39:23,220 --> 00:39:27,220
A hob is the rings on top of the stove

1033
00:39:27,220 --> 00:39:30,220
with the little thing around it.

1034
00:39:30,220 --> 00:39:31,220
It's the piano?

1035
00:39:31,220 --> 00:39:33,220
Are you trying to shock me?

1036
00:39:33,220 --> 00:39:35,220
Of course it's not the piano.

1037
00:39:35,220 --> 00:39:37,220
Which of these is...

1038
00:39:37,220 --> 00:39:40,220
Which of these is villains is...

1039
00:39:40,220 --> 00:39:42,220
What? Wait, is that me or is that the game?

1040
00:39:42,220 --> 00:39:44,220
Which of these is villains is not from the...

1041
00:39:44,220 --> 00:39:45,220
Alright, shut up.

1042
00:39:45,220 --> 00:39:47,220
Okay, the Joker is DC.

1043
00:39:50,220 --> 00:39:53,220
The Bane is DC.

1044
00:39:54,220 --> 00:39:58,220
Galactus and Lex Luthor.

1045
00:39:58,220 --> 00:40:00,220
I don't know who these people are.

1046
00:40:04,220 --> 00:40:05,220
Ah.

1047
00:40:13,220 --> 00:40:15,220
It didn't equal a good film.

1048
00:40:15,220 --> 00:40:17,220
Thank you, tiny spainy.

1049
00:40:17,220 --> 00:40:19,220
Yeah, Reefling, stop the infighting.

1050
00:40:19,220 --> 00:40:21,220
You know, when Veeler started,

1051
00:40:21,220 --> 00:40:23,220
we got like lots of comments like,

1052
00:40:23,220 --> 00:40:25,220
oh, the infighting between the girls is going to be intense.

1053
00:40:25,220 --> 00:40:26,220
I can't believe it.

1054
00:40:26,220 --> 00:40:29,220
The infighting was with the fucking Reeflings all along.

1055
00:40:29,220 --> 00:40:31,220
It's not even the streamer.

1056
00:40:31,220 --> 00:40:32,220
Ah!

1057
00:40:33,220 --> 00:40:34,220
Okay.

1058
00:40:36,220 --> 00:40:38,220
Now, I'm totally not cheating.

1059
00:40:38,220 --> 00:40:40,220
I'm taking Galactus to heat.

1060
00:40:40,220 --> 00:40:42,220
I'm on level 10 of the shocker.

1061
00:40:42,220 --> 00:40:44,220
Right, I'm on level 10 of the shocker.

1062
00:40:44,220 --> 00:40:45,220
Give me...

1063
00:40:47,220 --> 00:40:50,220
Which word refers to land

1064
00:40:50,220 --> 00:40:52,220
which is suitable for growing crops?

1065
00:40:52,220 --> 00:40:53,220
Fair tale.

1066
00:40:54,220 --> 00:40:55,220
Risible?

1067
00:40:56,220 --> 00:40:57,220
Wait, oh no.

1068
00:40:58,220 --> 00:41:00,220
I don't know this one.

1069
00:41:00,220 --> 00:41:01,220
Risible?

1070
00:41:01,220 --> 00:41:02,220
You want to...

1071
00:41:02,220 --> 00:41:03,220
Hey, little crops.

1072
00:41:03,220 --> 00:41:05,220
You want to propagate for me, baby girl?

1073
00:41:06,220 --> 00:41:07,220
Risible land.

1074
00:41:08,220 --> 00:41:09,220
That's awful.

1075
00:41:10,220 --> 00:41:12,220
I'm going to have to cheat, see, doodle

1076
00:41:12,220 --> 00:41:14,220
and actually do...

1077
00:41:14,220 --> 00:41:15,220
Audience!

1078
00:41:16,220 --> 00:41:17,220
Right.

1079
00:41:17,220 --> 00:41:18,220
Boom!

1080
00:41:18,220 --> 00:41:20,220
Arabal land.

1081
00:41:20,220 --> 00:41:21,220
Any arabal landers.

1082
00:41:26,220 --> 00:41:28,220
What's dragon trainer?

1083
00:41:28,220 --> 00:41:30,220
Are you speaking to me right now?

1084
00:41:30,220 --> 00:41:31,220
Wait, what?

1085
00:41:31,220 --> 00:41:32,220
Ignore tiny spiny.

1086
00:41:32,220 --> 00:41:34,220
He doesn't understand the movie

1087
00:41:34,220 --> 00:41:36,220
or the community don't claim his whack.

1088
00:41:36,220 --> 00:41:37,220
Copinion.

1089
00:41:39,220 --> 00:41:40,220
Thank you, Karen Quist.

1090
00:41:40,220 --> 00:41:42,220
Pay for roasting the Reeflings.

1091
00:41:43,220 --> 00:41:45,220
For his opinion on the movie,

1092
00:41:45,220 --> 00:41:47,220
he's getting annihilated.

1093
00:41:47,220 --> 00:41:48,220
He's going to be the right answer.

1094
00:41:48,220 --> 00:41:50,220
Okay, arabal land.

1095
00:41:50,220 --> 00:41:52,220
Not to be confused with...

1096
00:41:53,220 --> 00:41:54,220

he's no the enemy a brother or consciousness is either a or d I want

1359
01:09:28,060 --> 01:09:32,820
to say this is consciousness because because Pinocchio doesn't know better

1360
01:09:32,820 --> 01:09:38,020
right surely because I think he gets swallowed by a whale okay okay we we

1435
01:17:45,360 --> 01:17:55,560
truly according to the rest of cats what does the cat know knows where it's at

1436
01:17:55,560 --> 01:18:02,120
everybody wants to be a cat because the cat's the only cat that knows where it's

1437
01:18:02,120 --> 01:18:10,520
waiting for me to answer this your final answer got it right I knew that one

1438
01:18:10,520 --> 01:18:19,080
because of our mr. shit where was celebrity chef Gordon born I didn't

1439
01:18:19,080 --> 01:18:28,240
can I say American you might know cuz he swears like a British person I see

1440
01:18:28,240 --> 01:18:30,920
scottish born

1441
01:18:33,120 --> 01:18:36,120
is a

1442
01:18:37,360 --> 01:18:44,320
he doesn't send that question am I going mental wait so Jamie Oliver's the

1443
01:18:44,320 --> 01:18:49,880
brit is the English one and then Gordon Ramsey's the Scottish one am I going

1444
01:18:49,880 --> 01:18:57,360
mental and saying he doesn't he seems like he's Scottish like that's a mental

1445
01:18:57,360 --> 01:19:02,880
but he doesn't seem that Scottish to me like he is from glisco right he's

1446
01:19:02,880 --> 01:19:08,240
adapted America I think every clip I see him he is in America and like he's

1447
01:19:08,240 --> 01:19:13,240
trying to fix American restaurants which is probably why I'm like oh all right I

1448
01:19:13,240 --> 01:19:16,920
didn't know that maybe I should support him a bit more he's famous for his rage

1449
01:19:16,920 --> 01:19:20,920
I thought I was thinking like I only came from the rage but he's always like in

1450
01:19:20,920 --> 01:19:25,160
American restaurants like you've got rats there's rats dropping you've got this

1451
01:19:25,200 --> 01:19:31,040
you've got that like all that mani toba and Nova Scotia are provinces of which

1452
01:19:31,040 --> 01:19:33,680
country

1453
01:19:35,160 --> 01:19:41,400
is it Canada I want to say it's Canada Nova Scotia sounds like Canada

1454
01:19:41,680 --> 01:19:44,480
the

1455
01:19:48,400 --> 01:19:51,400
is

1456
01:19:52,400 --> 01:20:01,600
Canada which of the following are a pair of Disney cartoon characters

1457
01:20:01,600 --> 01:20:05,600
I love Chippendale they're two little chipmunks and one has a red

1458
01:20:05,600 --> 01:20:07,600

Give me that go clap, give me that go clap.

1466
01:20:22,600 --> 01:20:25,600
What does Mardi Gras literally mean?

1467
01:20:25,600 --> 01:20:27,600
A free something?

1468
01:20:27,600 --> 01:20:29,600
Wait, wait, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1469
01:20:29,600 --> 01:20:31,600
This isn't French?

1470
01:20:31,600 --> 01:20:33,600
Mardi Gras?

1471
01:20:33,600 --> 01:20:35,600
Wait, this isn't French?

1472
01:20:35,600 --> 01:20:37,600
Mardi.

1473
01:20:37,600 --> 01:20:39,600
Vendredi.

1474
01:20:39,600 --> 01:20:41,600
Wait, Fat Tuesday?

1475
01:20:41,600 --> 01:20:43,600
No, try me.

1476
01:20:43,600 --> 01:20:45,600
It is French.

1477
01:20:45,600 --> 01:20:47,600
Vendredi.

1478
01:20:47,600 --> 01:20:49,600
Mercredi.

1479
01:20:49,600 --> 01:20:51,600
Mardi.

1480
01:20:51,600 --> 01:20:53,600
No?

1481
01:20:53,600 --> 01:20:55,600
Is it Fat Trude Gras?

1482
01:20:55,600 --> 01:20:57,600
Yes.

1483
01:20:57,600 --> 01:20:59,600
Butchou, stay in it.

1484
01:20:59,600 --> 01:21:01,600
Yeah, oh my god, we translated that.

1485
01:21:01,600 --> 01:21:03,600
We translated that.

1486
01:21:03,600 --> 01:21:05,600
Roots to the wind.

1487
01:21:05,600 --> 01:21:07,600
Oh my god.

1488
01:21:07,600 --> 01:21:09,600
Oh my god.

1489
01:21:09,600 --> 01:21:11,600
I'm so surprised we could do that one.

1490
01:21:11,600 --> 01:21:13,600
Oh my god, we're so smart.

1491
01:21:13,600 --> 01:21:15,600
What the heck, why are we so smart?

1492
01:21:15,600 --> 01:21:17,600
Like seriously, I'm really private of that one.

1493
01:21:17,600 --> 01:21:19,600
Sorry, I'm really happy with that one.

1494
01:21:19,600 --> 01:21:21,600
The title dog in the anime

1495
01:21:21,600 --> 01:21:23,600
it found Clifford's big red dog

1496
01:21:23,600 --> 01:21:25,600
has what color for?

1497
01:21:25,600 --> 01:21:29,600
Oh, well Clifford's red dog is a British thing.

1498
01:21:29,600 --> 01:21:31,600
Sunny, welcome to the Ritling.

1499
01:21:33,600 --> 01:21:35,600
Please enjoy the emotes.

1500
01:21:35,600 --> 01:21:37,600
There's more on the way and one of them

1501
01:21:37,600 --> 01:21:39,600
I'm giving you a big smooch.

1502
01:21:39,600 --> 01:21:41,600
That will be my final answer.

1503
01:21:41,600 --> 01:21:43,600
Noménage 3, Monsieur.

1504
01:21:45,600 --> 01:21:47,600
Je voudrais menager 3

1505
01:21:47,600 --> 01:21:49,600
avec deux messieurs.

1506
01:21:49,600 --> 01:21:51,600
Clifford the big red dog.

1507
01:21:51,600 --> 01:21:53,600
I'm good to keep my cool and it paid off.

1508
01:21:53,600 --> 01:21:55,600
And it paid off?

1509
01:21:55,600 --> 01:21:57,600
Any payer offer?

1510
01:21:57,600 --> 01:21:59,600
Yay, what?

1511
01:21:59,600 --> 01:22:01,600
We have Pokemon questions.

1512
01:22:01,600 --> 01:22:03,600
Can you just constantly give me Pokemon questions?

1513
01:22:03,600 --> 01:22:05,600
For real, for real, because they're not going to do anything past Gen 5

1514
01:22:05,600 --> 01:22:07,600
because of the development of this game.

1515
01:22:07,600 --> 01:22:09,600
And I know everything before Gen 5.

1516
01:22:09,600 --> 01:22:11,600
Roughly.

1517
01:22:11,600 --> 01:22:13,600
Onyx is a rock type Pokemon

1518
01:22:13,600 --> 01:22:15,600
and it's the only rock type and nothing else.

1519
01:22:15,600 --> 01:22:17,600
Which is a shame.

1520
01:22:17,600 --> 01:22:19,600
Give me more Pokemon please.

1521
01:22:19,600 --> 01:22:21,600
Give me all the Pokemans.

1522
01:22:23,600 --> 01:22:25,600
Okay, it's a rock.

1523
01:22:25,600 --> 01:22:27,600
In British history, what relation

1524
01:22:27,600 --> 01:22:29,600
was King George to Queen Elizabeth?

1525
01:22:29,600 --> 01:22:31,600
Some sort of ancestral

1526
01:22:31,600 --> 01:22:33,600
vibe is what I'm going to get.

1527
01:22:33,600 --> 01:22:35,600
If you've ever looked into the royal family,

1528
01:22:35,600 --> 01:22:37,600
it's all interest, all the way down.

1529
01:22:37,600 --> 01:22:39,600
Strong, you can't just speak French like that.

1530
01:22:39,600 --> 01:22:41,600
You sound nice when you do it.

1531
01:22:41,600 --> 01:22:43,600
Ha ha.

1532
01:22:43,600 --> 01:22:45,600
Oh, it's you.

1533
01:22:45,600 --> 01:22:47,600
Tu voudrais

1534
01:22:47,600 --> 01:22:49,600
parler avec moi?

1535
01:22:49,600 --> 01:22:51,600
What, you're like my French, aren't you?

1536
01:22:51,600 --> 01:22:53,600
I'm all done here when I'm speaking

1537
01:22:53,600 --> 01:22:55,600
when I'm on the parler vous la france

1538
01:22:55,600 --> 01:22:57,600
Francais, you know.

1539
01:22:57,600 --> 01:22:59,600
I'm all the way up here.

1540
01:22:59,600 --> 01:23:01,600
In British history, what was the relation?

1541
01:23:01,600 --> 01:23:03,600
Grandfather.

1542
01:23:03,600 --> 01:23:05,600
It may be grandfather, you actually know that wrong.

1543
01:23:05,600 --> 01:23:07,600
I totally cheat, he did a little look to the chat

1544
01:23:07,600 --> 01:23:09,600
so if it's not grandfather, you're getting wrecked.

1545
01:23:09,600 --> 01:23:11,600
Can't spell ancestry without incest.

1546
01:23:11,600 --> 01:23:13,600
Is this your final answer?

1547
01:23:13,600 --> 01:23:15,600
Onyx is rock background.

1548
01:23:15,600 --> 01:23:17,600
I thought he was rock only.

1549
01:23:17,600 --> 01:23:19,600
Hmm.

1550
01:23:21,600 --> 01:23:23,600
You know what?

1551
01:23:23,600 --> 01:23:25,600
Whoever said is it D.

1552
01:23:25,600 --> 01:23:27,600
Mods, time that man out for 10 whole seconds.

1553
01:23:27,600 --> 01:23:29,600
Oh, it's a disaster.

1554
01:23:29,600 --> 01:23:31,600
Get that man, Mods.

1555
01:23:31,600 --> 01:23:33,600
10 seconds.

1556
01:23:33,600 --> 01:23:35,600
Sick of him.

1557
01:23:35,600 --> 01:23:37,600
I'm getting shocked because of your

1558
01:23:37,600 --> 01:23:39,600
foolish ambitions. Put them to rest.

1559
01:23:39,600 --> 01:23:41,600
How dare you!

1560
01:23:41,600 --> 01:23:43,600
Hup the it.

1561
01:23:43,600 --> 01:23:45,600
10 whole seconds, exactly.

1562
01:23:45,600 --> 01:23:47,600
Slice them and dice them.

1563
01:23:47,600 --> 01:23:49,600
Okay.

1564
01:23:49,600 --> 01:23:51,600
Ready?

1565
01:23:51,600 --> 01:23:53,600
Okay, this is 10 so I think it won't be as bad.

1566
01:23:53,600 --> 01:23:55,600
Right, okay.

1567
01:23:55,600 --> 01:23:57,600
I'm gonna set up. I need to set up for this.

1568
01:23:57,600 --> 01:23:59,600
What? Okay, 3, 2, 1.

1569
01:23:59,600 --> 01:24:01,600
Oh, okay.

1570
01:24:01,600 --> 01:24:03,600
It's still quite as bad.

1571
01:24:03,600 --> 01:24:05,600
I'm gonna be honest, it's still quite as bad.

1572
01:24:09,600 --> 01:24:11,600
It's still quite as bad.

1573
01:24:11,600 --> 01:24:13,600
I actually see additional content.

1574
01:24:13,600 --> 01:24:15,600
I'm gonna go to the DLC store.

1575
01:24:15,600 --> 01:24:17,600
Give them 10 whole lashes.

1576
01:24:19,600 --> 01:24:21,600
Right, solo.

1577
01:24:21,600 --> 01:24:23,600
Right, now.

1578
01:24:23,600 --> 01:24:25,600
I'm gonna play a new version of this game.

1579
01:24:25,600 --> 01:24:27,600
You guys have to come together

1580
01:24:27,600 --> 01:24:29,600
and answer the question.

1581
01:24:29,600 --> 01:24:31,600
If you guys give me the wrong question,

1582
01:24:31,600 --> 01:24:33,600
everyone gets timed out.

1583
01:24:33,600 --> 01:24:35,600
I'm literally gonna open up the stream

1584
01:24:35,600 --> 01:24:37,600
so I can do the timeouts as well.

1585
01:24:37,600 --> 01:24:39,600
And if we do not win

1586
01:24:39,600 --> 01:24:41,600
a normal Mod based on

1587
01:24:41,600 --> 01:24:43,600
your votes,

1588
01:24:43,600 --> 01:24:45,600
I will manually time you out

1589
01:24:45,600 --> 01:24:47,600
along with my moderation team

1590
01:24:47,600 --> 01:24:49,600
and you're all getting timed out.

1591
01:24:49,600 --> 01:24:51,600
I'll make myself clear, but I'll still get shocked.

1592
01:24:51,600 --> 01:24:53,600
I'll still get shocked,

1593
01:24:53,600 --> 01:24:55,600
but you're all getting timed out as well.

1594
01:24:55,600 --> 01:24:57,600
Forgive me the wrong answer.

1595
01:24:57,600 --> 01:24:59,600
Mods, put the shock collar on that replay.

1596
01:24:59,600 --> 01:25:01,600
Thank you for the extended membership.

1597
01:25:01,600 --> 01:25:03,600
No, no cheating.

1598
01:25:03,600 --> 01:25:05,600
It has to be collective knowledge.

1599
01:25:05,600 --> 01:25:07,600
No cheating.

1600
01:25:07,600 --> 01:25:09,600
Okay, let me set this up.

1601
01:25:09,600 --> 01:25:11,600
So if I don't know what it is,

1602
01:25:11,600 --> 01:25:13,600
I will ask chat and if we get it wrong,

1603
01:25:13,600 --> 01:25:15,600
right, everything gets unlocked.

1604
01:25:15,600 --> 01:25:17,600
Everything gets unlocked, okay?

1605
01:25:19,600 --> 01:25:21,600
Because we need to do it fair and square.

1606
01:25:21,600 --> 01:25:23,600
Everything is unlocked.

1607
01:25:23,600 --> 01:25:25,600
I did a little bit of not knowing.

1608
01:25:25,600 --> 01:25:27,600
Sorry, you're okay.

1609
01:25:27,600 --> 01:25:29,600
You're forgiven.

1610
01:25:29,600 --> 01:25:31,600
You're forgiven.

1611
01:25:31,600 --> 01:25:33,600
Big brains will close.

1612
01:25:33,600 --> 01:25:35,600
Yeah, no cheating.

1613
01:25:35,600 --> 01:25:37,600
It has to be our collective knowledge, okay?

1614
01:25:37,600 --> 01:25:39,600
It has to be our collective knowledge.

1615
01:25:39,600 --> 01:25:41,600
Okay, who is Scrooge's nephew?

1616
01:25:41,600 --> 01:25:43,600
We know it's Donald Duck.

1617
01:25:43,600 --> 01:25:45,600
I know the answer.

1618
01:25:45,600 --> 01:25:47,600
That's fine.

1619
01:25:47,600 --> 01:25:49,600
Good, good, good, good.

1620
01:25:49,600 --> 01:25:51,600
What is normally seen above a pair of crossbones

1621
01:25:51,600 --> 01:25:53,600
in the Jolly Roger?

1622
01:25:53,600 --> 01:25:55,600
A skull.

1623
01:25:55,600 --> 01:25:57,600
As I said, if I already know it,

1624
01:25:57,600 --> 01:25:59,600
then we'll do it.

1625
01:26:01,600 --> 01:26:03,600
Attila was the king of the hunt?

1626
01:26:07,600 --> 01:26:09,600
Oh, hold on a minute.

1627
01:26:09,600 --> 01:26:11,600
Let me do it.

1628
01:26:11,600 --> 01:26:13,600
The Huns?

1629
01:26:13,600 --> 01:26:15,600
Okay, okay, okay, you guys seem confident.

1630
01:26:15,600 --> 01:26:17,600
I know the answer.

1631
01:26:17,600 --> 01:26:19,600
Attila the king of the Huns.

1632
01:26:19,600 --> 01:26:21,600
But not the Mongolian throat singers.

1633
01:26:21,600 --> 01:26:23,600
Don't get them confuzzled, okay?

1634
01:26:23,600 --> 01:26:25,600
Good luck.

1635
01:26:25,600 --> 01:26:27,600
Which of these utensils is best

1636
01:26:27,600 --> 01:26:29,600
for serving Maligat al-Wini?

1637
01:26:33,600 --> 01:26:35,600
Borsh or Gazpacho?

1638
01:26:37,600 --> 01:26:39,600
A ladle?

1639
01:26:39,600 --> 01:26:41,600
Okay.

1640
01:26:41,600 --> 01:26:43,600
Okay, I'm getting ladle.

1641
01:26:43,600 --> 01:26:45,600
Okay, but I'm getting ladle.

1642
01:26:45,600 --> 01:26:47,600
We're doing ladle, thank you.

1643
01:26:47,600 --> 01:26:49,600
I don't know what Gorsapacho is,

1644
01:26:49,600 --> 01:26:51,600
but it is what it is.

1645
01:26:53,600 --> 01:26:55,600
Well, in my opinion.

1646
01:26:55,600 --> 01:26:57,600
Could you imagine if we got it wrong?

1647
01:26:57,600 --> 01:26:59,600
Can you move a little bit to the right?

1648
01:26:59,600 --> 01:27:01,600
How dare you ask me so kindly?

1649
01:27:01,600 --> 01:27:03,600
Hold on, that needs to be...

1650
01:27:03,600 --> 01:27:05,600
There.

1651
01:27:05,600 --> 01:27:07,600
There.

1652
01:27:07,600 --> 01:27:09,600
In an infamous

1653
01:27:09,600 --> 01:27:11,600
1997

1654
01:27:11,600 --> 01:27:13,600
World

1655
01:27:13,600 --> 01:27:15,600
World WBA

1656
01:27:15,600 --> 01:27:17,600
boxing match, mate Tyson

1657
01:27:17,600 --> 01:27:19,600
took a bait of someone's ear.

1658
01:27:19,600 --> 01:27:21,600
Yeah, his ear.

1659
01:27:21,600 --> 01:27:23,600
The bait of...

1660
01:27:23,600 --> 01:27:25,600
The bait of 97?

1661
01:27:25,600 --> 01:27:27,600
Yeah, his ear.

1662
01:27:27,600 --> 01:27:29,600
Okay.

1663
01:27:29,600 --> 01:27:31,600
Hmm.

1664
01:27:31,600 --> 01:27:33,600
Which of these animals shares his name

1665
01:27:33,600 --> 01:27:35,600
with a tiger lily?

1666
01:27:35,600 --> 01:27:37,600
Surely it's saying tiger lily, right?

1667
01:27:37,600 --> 01:27:39,600
Right.

1668
01:27:39,600 --> 01:27:41,600
It's saying tiger lily.

1669
01:27:41,600 --> 01:27:43,600
Yeah, tiger.

1670
01:27:43,600 --> 01:27:45,600
Okay, come.

1671
01:27:45,600 --> 01:27:47,600
See, look how much farther we're getting

1672
01:27:47,600 --> 01:27:49,600
because you guys are gating me.

1673
01:27:49,600 --> 01:27:51,600
Literally, I'm holding your hand.

1674
01:27:51,600 --> 01:27:53,600
Yesterday I held your hand through the hypnosis.

1675
01:27:53,600 --> 01:27:55,600
Today you're holding my hand through the questions.

1676
01:27:55,600 --> 01:27:57,600
Um...

1677
01:27:57,600 --> 01:27:59,600
I hope you... Oh, I keep reading what he says.

1678
01:27:59,600 --> 01:28:01,600
Which popular cocktail

1679
01:28:01,600 --> 01:28:03,600
contains a mixture

1680
01:28:03,600 --> 01:28:05,600
of avocat

1681
01:28:05,600 --> 01:28:07,600
and lemonade.

1682
01:28:07,600 --> 01:28:09,600
Uh, any alcoholic reeflings

1683
01:28:09,600 --> 01:28:11,600
lurking that could help us out here?

1684
01:28:11,600 --> 01:28:13,600
Uh...

1685
01:28:13,600 --> 01:28:15,600
Oh, what in the scubity?

1686
01:28:15,600 --> 01:28:17,600
I've got one C.

1687
01:28:17,600 --> 01:28:19,600
Oh, it's C.

1688
01:28:19,600 --> 01:28:21,600
My mum makes these.

1689
01:28:21,600 --> 01:28:23,600
Right! It's all on you

1690
01:28:23,600 --> 01:28:25,600
and your mum.

1691
01:28:25,600 --> 01:28:27,600
It's all on you and your mum.

1692
01:28:27,600 --> 01:28:29,600
Let's go with the right answer and therefore

1693
01:28:29,600 --> 01:28:31,600
it's all on you and your mum.

1694
01:28:31,600 --> 01:28:33,600
You sure?

1695
01:28:33,600 --> 01:28:35,600
If this is wrong, I have full permission

1696
01:28:35,600 --> 01:28:37,600
to bang your mum and she's making me a

1697
01:28:37,600 --> 01:28:39,600
language after.

1698
01:28:39,600 --> 01:28:41,600
It's all on you.

1699
01:28:41,600 --> 01:28:43,600
The choice is made.

1700
01:28:43,600 --> 01:28:45,600
It's time to discover the right answer.

1701
01:28:45,600 --> 01:28:47,600
All on you.

1702
01:28:47,600 --> 01:28:49,600
Wow, okay.

1703
01:28:49,600 --> 01:28:51,600
Your mother will remain bangless

1704
01:28:51,600 --> 01:28:53,600
for one more day.

1705
01:28:55,600 --> 01:28:57,600
On which date

1706
01:28:57,600 --> 01:28:59,600
is Canada's national day?

1707
01:29:01,600 --> 01:29:03,600
Oh,

1708
01:29:03,600 --> 01:29:05,600
reeflings that have a leaf!

1709
01:29:05,600 --> 01:29:07,600
A fucking leaf!

1710
01:29:07,600 --> 01:29:09,600
What is it?

1711
01:29:09,600 --> 01:29:11,600
C? C.

1712
01:29:11,600 --> 01:29:13,600
July 1st.

1713
01:29:13,600 --> 01:29:15,600
Okay, reeflings, thank you.

1714
01:29:15,600 --> 01:29:17,600
I'm going to choose C.

1715
01:29:17,600 --> 01:29:19,600
You seem to be convinced, but

1716
01:29:19,600 --> 01:29:21,600
is this your final answer?

1717
01:29:21,600 --> 01:29:23,600
April Fool.

1718
01:29:23,600 --> 01:29:25,600
Yes, that's my final answer.

1719
01:29:25,600 --> 01:29:27,600
Cluck, cluck, cluck.

1720
01:29:27,600 --> 01:29:29,600
Okay.

1721
01:29:29,600 --> 01:29:31,600
To American for this, sorry mate.

1722
01:29:31,600 --> 01:29:33,600
Will you be able to answer this

1723
01:29:33,600 --> 01:29:35,600
new question as well?

1724
01:29:35,600 --> 01:29:37,600
Yeah,

1725
01:29:37,600 --> 01:29:39,600
insert Terry

1726
01:29:39,600 --> 01:29:41,600
Pratchett's

1727
01:29:41,600 --> 01:29:43,600
fantasy novel series,

1728
01:29:43,600 --> 01:29:45,600
Discworld is balanced

1729
01:29:45,600 --> 01:29:47,600
on the back of a

1730
01:29:47,600 --> 01:29:49,600
what four animals?

1731
01:29:51,600 --> 01:29:53,600
Elephants?

1732
01:29:53,600 --> 01:29:55,600
I've never seen that one.

1733
01:29:55,600 --> 01:29:57,600
I'm confident that it's me.

1734
01:29:57,600 --> 01:29:59,600
Okay, we're picking C.

1735
01:29:59,600 --> 01:30:01,600
Super duper elephants.

1736
01:30:01,600 --> 01:30:03,600
God, you guys are so smart.

1737
01:30:03,600 --> 01:30:05,600
What the heck? How do you know all of this?

1738
01:30:07,600 --> 01:30:09,600
It's based on some Hindu stuff.

1739
01:30:09,600 --> 01:30:11,600
Oh, that would have been me.

1740
01:30:11,600 --> 01:30:13,600
16,000 quid!

1741
01:30:13,600 --> 01:30:15,600
We can put a down payment

1742
01:30:15,600 --> 01:30:17,600
on a shed in the UK, let's go.

1743
01:30:17,600 --> 01:30:19,600
Put a down payment on that shed

1744
01:30:19,600 --> 01:30:21,600
and we can get fish and chips too.

1745
01:30:21,600 --> 01:30:23,600
Short work of this new question.

1746
01:30:23,600 --> 01:30:25,600
What nationality

1747
01:30:25,600 --> 01:30:27,600
was the artist

1748
01:30:27,600 --> 01:30:29,600
Hiro Nymes Bosch?

1749
01:30:29,600 --> 01:30:31,600
So Bosch is a washing machine brand

1750
01:30:31,600 --> 01:30:33,600
and I think it comes

1751
01:30:33,600 --> 01:30:35,600
from Norway, is my guess.

1752
01:30:35,600 --> 01:30:37,600
No, not that.

1753
01:30:37,600 --> 01:30:39,600
We've got Dutch.

1754
01:30:39,600 --> 01:30:41,600
Literally who? Oh, we've got Swiss.

1755
01:30:41,600 --> 01:30:43,600
Dutch, we've got C question mark.

1756
01:30:43,600 --> 01:30:45,600
We've got a few C's.

1757
01:30:45,600 --> 01:30:47,600
We've got a few C's.

1758
01:30:47,600 --> 01:30:49,600
Some's Dutch.

1759
01:30:49,600 --> 01:30:51,600
I'll have some

1760
01:30:53,600 --> 01:30:55,600
Netherlands.

1761
01:30:55,600 --> 01:30:57,600
Netherlands, Monning.

1762
01:30:59,600 --> 01:31:01,600
It's BF, but is this your final answer?

1763
01:31:01,600 --> 01:31:03,600
Monning is plural.

1764
01:31:03,600 --> 01:31:05,600
That will be my final answer.

1765
01:31:05,600 --> 01:31:07,600
Okay, okay.

1766
01:31:07,600 --> 01:31:09,600
Look at us go in there, 2,000.

1767
01:31:09,600 --> 01:31:11,600
Take away for all tonight.

1768
01:31:11,600 --> 01:31:13,600
Take away for all.

1769
01:31:13,600 --> 01:31:15,600
Everyone is getting lined up and milk

1770
01:31:15,600 --> 01:31:17,600
one by one.

1771
01:31:17,600 --> 01:31:19,400
Look at each other in the eyes while it's happening.

1772
01:31:19,400 --> 01:31:20,240
Just let me do my thing.

1773
01:31:20,240 --> 01:31:22,580
Which EastEnders actor, partner?

1774
01:31:22,580 --> 01:31:24,460
Oh, British Reflings.

1775
01:31:24,460 --> 01:31:25,540
Good morning.

1776
01:31:25,540 --> 01:31:26,380
Good evening.

1777
01:31:26,380 --> 01:31:27,380
Please tell me.

1778
01:31:27,380 --> 01:31:29,660
Which EastEnders actor partnered?

1779
01:31:29,660 --> 01:31:34,660
Partnered Hannah Cartoon on the BBC Strictly Come Dancing.

1780
01:31:36,060 --> 01:31:36,980
I'm American.

1781
01:31:36,980 --> 01:31:38,620
I don't watch EastEnders.

1782
01:31:38,620 --> 01:31:40,140
Someone says C.

1783
01:31:40,140 --> 01:31:41,780
Someone says A.

1784
01:31:41,780 --> 01:31:42,820
I don't know.

1785
01:31:42,820 --> 01:31:44,540
Oh my God.

1786
01:31:44,540 --> 01:31:47,060
Are there any British Reflings called Tealings?

1787
01:31:47,060 --> 01:31:49,020
Any Tealings?

1788
01:31:49,020 --> 01:31:49,860
B.

1789
01:31:49,860 --> 01:31:51,380
Oh, you're all saying conflicting things.

1790
01:31:51,380 --> 01:31:52,220
Right, okay.

1791
01:31:52,220 --> 01:31:53,740
We're going to do the 50-50.

1792
01:31:53,740 --> 01:31:55,740
We're still allowed to do the 50-50.

1793
01:31:55,740 --> 01:31:56,580
Okay.

1794
01:31:56,580 --> 01:31:57,900
Let's take away from the 50-50.

1795
01:31:57,900 --> 01:31:58,740
I mean, take it from there.

1796
01:31:58,740 --> 01:31:59,580
I'm not British.

1797
01:31:59,580 --> 01:32:00,420
There's no British, right?

1798
01:32:00,420 --> 01:32:01,260
Tealings?

1799
01:32:02,140 --> 01:32:03,660
Tealings, please.

1800
01:32:04,620 --> 01:32:05,660
Tealings, please.

1801
01:32:05,660 --> 01:32:06,740
It's a fifth.

1802
01:32:06,740 --> 01:32:08,060
I sell milk.

1803
01:32:08,060 --> 01:32:09,700
Not getting milked.

1804
01:32:09,700 --> 01:32:10,860
D.

1805
01:32:10,860 --> 01:32:11,980
I'm not British.

1806
01:32:11,980 --> 01:32:12,820
A.

1807
01:32:12,820 --> 01:32:13,660
Hello.

1808
01:32:13,660 --> 01:32:14,500
D.

1809
01:32:14,500 --> 01:32:15,340
There are no British.

1810
01:32:15,340 --> 01:32:16,660
The British, I don't know.

1811
01:32:16,740 --> 01:32:18,060
I'm British, and I don't know.

1812
01:32:18,060 --> 01:32:20,540
I'm British, but I don't watch Strictly Come Dancing.

1813
01:32:20,540 --> 01:32:21,660
I used to watch it with my gran.

1814
01:32:21,660 --> 01:32:22,500
It was so fun.

1815
01:32:22,500 --> 01:32:23,460
Brit here hate TV.

1816
01:32:23,460 --> 01:32:24,300
Felt that.

1817
01:32:24,300 --> 01:32:26,180
Felt that while passing.

1818
01:32:26,180 --> 01:32:29,660
When I moved out into a flat,

1819
01:32:29,660 --> 01:32:32,460
I used to get hounded with letters through the door,

1820
01:32:32,460 --> 01:32:34,180
threatening for someone to come and check

1821
01:32:34,180 --> 01:32:35,700
if I've got a TV or not.

1822
01:32:35,700 --> 01:32:37,580
And then I hate BBC and everything.

1823
01:32:37,580 --> 01:32:38,500
I'll die on A.

1824
01:32:38,500 --> 01:32:39,340
I'm British.

1825
01:32:39,340 --> 01:32:40,620
It's D.

1826
01:32:40,620 --> 01:32:42,060
British here, it's D.

1827
01:32:42,060 --> 01:32:42,900
D.

1828
01:32:42,900 --> 01:32:43,740
Oh, it's going, right.

1829
01:32:43,740 --> 01:32:44,580
I'm going for the D.

1830
01:32:44,580 --> 01:32:45,420
I'm a gambler.

1831
01:32:45,420 --> 01:32:46,260
And so I'm choosing D.

1832
01:32:46,260 --> 01:32:47,700
I'm going for D.

1833
01:32:47,700 --> 01:32:48,700
Are you absolutely sure?

1834
01:32:48,700 --> 01:32:49,620
Please, no more shocks.

1835
01:32:49,620 --> 01:32:50,460
Is that your final answer?

1836
01:32:50,460 --> 01:32:51,580
Please, no more shocks.

1837
01:32:51,580 --> 01:32:54,740
I'm begging, begging you.

1838
01:32:54,740 --> 01:32:58,340
And that's my final answer.

1839
01:32:58,340 --> 01:32:59,700
I hate the TV license.

1840
01:32:59,700 --> 01:33:03,580
Oh, I can't wait to see the correct answer.

1841
01:33:03,580 --> 01:33:05,780
Oh, Bruce Lee!

1842
01:33:05,780 --> 01:33:08,620
Right, whoever said D, you're out.

1843
01:33:08,620 --> 01:33:11,060
Hold on, let me freaking ban you all right now.

1844
01:33:11,060 --> 01:33:12,660
D, D, trust in the Brits.

1845
01:33:12,660 --> 01:33:13,700
Oh, that was the wrong answer.

1846
01:33:13,700 --> 01:33:15,380
Put user and time out.

1847
01:33:15,380 --> 01:33:17,620
10 seconds confirmed.

1848
01:33:17,620 --> 01:33:20,220
Right, I'll die on D.

1849
01:33:21,460 --> 01:33:23,980
Put user on time out, 10 seconds.

1850
01:33:23,980 --> 01:33:25,780
Get out of here!

1851
01:33:25,780 --> 01:33:27,620
Get out of here!

1852
01:33:27,620 --> 01:33:30,300
Get out of here!

1853
01:33:30,300 --> 01:33:33,380
Anyone else had the audacity to say D?

1854
01:33:34,340 --> 01:33:35,980
Okay, you did it.

1855
01:33:35,980 --> 01:33:38,420
Okay, everyone's been caught.

1856
01:33:38,420 --> 01:33:40,020
Everyone's been caught.

1857
01:33:41,180 --> 01:33:42,420
Brits say it's D.

1858
01:33:42,420 --> 01:33:43,260
Well, guess what?

1859
01:33:43,260 --> 01:33:45,500
You said D as well, so you're getting put in time out.

1860
01:33:45,500 --> 01:33:48,140
10 seconds, get out of here!

1861
01:33:48,140 --> 01:33:50,140
Get out of here!

1862
01:33:50,140 --> 01:33:51,860
You made me get zapped!

1863
01:33:53,780 --> 01:33:57,260
We said A, no, there was more Ds!

1864
01:33:57,260 --> 01:33:58,780
You made me get zapped.

1865
01:33:58,780 --> 01:34:00,820
I'm American and I got it right.

1866
01:34:00,820 --> 01:34:02,180
I was at 50, 50.

1867
01:34:02,180 --> 01:34:03,220
Okay, no more.

1868
01:34:03,220 --> 01:34:05,900
Everyone's been timed out, that was naughty, okay?

1869
01:34:05,900 --> 01:34:07,380
Everyone's been timed out, that was naughty.

1870
01:34:07,380 --> 01:34:11,740
Okay, time for a controlled shock to Foxy.

1871
01:34:11,740 --> 01:34:12,580
Okay.

1872
01:34:15,780 --> 01:34:16,900
Come at it, okay.

1873
01:34:16,900 --> 01:34:19,660
We still got further than you, how dare you, okay?

1874
01:34:20,820 --> 01:34:25,220
Three, two, one.

1875
01:34:25,220 --> 01:34:26,660
Oh, I'm hesitating.

1876
01:34:26,660 --> 01:34:28,660
The pathways have been created.

1877
01:34:28,660 --> 01:34:29,900
That button equals pain,

1878
01:34:29,900 --> 01:34:32,140
so my brain doesn't wanna do it anymore.

1879
01:34:32,140 --> 01:34:33,140
Okay, three, two, one.

1880
01:34:35,540 --> 01:34:39,460
Okay, okay, I did it, I did it, I did it, I did it.

1881
01:34:39,460 --> 01:34:40,860
It's fine, it's fine, I did it.

1882
01:34:41,700 --> 01:34:44,380
Okay, it's fine.

1883
01:34:45,260 --> 01:34:47,100
I'm on 10.

1884
01:34:48,220 --> 01:34:49,660
32 was the highest score,

1885
01:34:49,660 --> 01:34:53,100
and we got as far as Bronzo, hell yeah, you did.

1886
01:34:53,100 --> 01:34:54,740
Okay, well we try again.

1887
01:34:54,740 --> 01:34:56,500
Surely we can win on normal mode,

1888
01:34:56,500 --> 01:34:59,540
if not we'll do easy mode when we start running at a time.

1889
01:34:59,540 --> 01:35:01,140
Wait, without a timer, go away.

1890
01:35:02,340 --> 01:35:04,300
I don't know, can I wanna take all the stuff

1891
01:35:04,300 --> 01:35:05,300
that none of us know?

1892
01:35:07,180 --> 01:35:09,220
Can we maybe remove one category?

1893
01:35:09,220 --> 01:35:10,180
What one?

1894
01:35:10,180 --> 01:35:11,540
I've already entered.

1895
01:35:11,540 --> 01:35:13,140
I've entered the layer.

1896
01:35:13,140 --> 01:35:15,420
Need Footy to survive, real.

1897
01:35:15,420 --> 01:35:16,580
I have failed you.

1898
01:35:17,780 --> 01:35:19,940
Which of these phrases describes

1899
01:35:19,940 --> 01:35:23,260
a restless and fidgety person answering his pants?

1900
01:35:23,260 --> 01:35:25,100
Let's go with the right answer, and therefore,

1901
01:35:25,100 --> 01:35:27,420
No, keep them all, I've been banned.

1902
01:35:27,420 --> 01:35:29,740
I'd have banned Footy.

1903
01:35:29,740 --> 01:35:32,060
More manga trivia, real.

1904
01:35:32,060 --> 01:35:33,740
Who is not friends with Harry Potter

1905
01:35:33,740 --> 01:35:35,740
when Harry got to Hogwarts?

1906
01:35:36,900 --> 01:35:38,740
Everyone, he had just got there,

1907
01:35:38,740 --> 01:35:40,660
and he was, he pals with anyone.

1908
01:35:40,660 --> 01:35:45,060
Well, Draco and Aggard was nice dumb, so it was Draco.

1909
01:35:45,060 --> 01:35:46,660
I'm confident that it's C.

1910
01:35:46,660 --> 01:35:49,340
Potter, we're Potter, Harry Potter.

1911
01:35:49,340 --> 01:35:51,500
Are you sure you've got them?

1912
01:35:51,500 --> 01:35:53,340
I'm so good at it.

1913
01:35:53,340 --> 01:35:55,980
Which of these words is the German equivalent?

1914
01:35:55,980 --> 01:36:00,540
Ge zonheit, ge zonheit, ge zonheit.

1915
01:36:01,820 --> 01:36:06,820
Oh no, achu schnell, achu glasnost, achu verbose.

1916
01:36:09,740 --> 01:36:11,740
Achu, ge zonheit.

1917
01:36:12,740 --> 01:36:14,740
I don't know why I added a bit of Dutch on the back of that one.

1918
01:36:14,740 --> 01:36:15,740
Ge zonheit.

1919
01:36:17,740 --> 01:36:21,740
What was the first name taken by the playwright Big William,

1920
01:36:21,740 --> 01:36:24,740
who wrote Cat on a Hot Tin Roof?

1921
01:36:24,740 --> 01:36:25,740
Huh?

1922
01:36:27,740 --> 01:36:28,740
Who?

1923
01:36:31,740 --> 01:36:32,740
Ge zonheit.

1924
01:36:32,740 --> 01:36:33,740
Who?

1925
01:36:34,740 --> 01:36:35,740
Who?

1926
01:36:36,740 --> 01:36:38,740
Hurry up and sneeze.

1927
01:36:38,740 --> 01:36:39,740
Oh.

1928
01:36:40,740 --> 01:36:41,740
Someone said D.

1929
01:36:42,740 --> 01:36:43,740
D maybe?

1930
01:36:43,740 --> 01:36:45,740
I think it's B or D.

1931
01:36:45,740 --> 01:36:49,740
Right, well 50-50 to remove the answer.

1932
01:36:50,740 --> 01:36:54,740
You wouldn't, you wouldn't get mummy shocked again so quickly,

1933
01:36:54,740 --> 01:36:56,740
no, would you, Reefling?

1934
01:36:59,740 --> 01:37:00,740
Okay.

1935
01:37:00,740 --> 01:37:01,740
Let's go.

1936
01:37:01,740 --> 01:37:04,740
Oh no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1937
01:37:04,740 --> 01:37:06,740
D, D, delta, delta.

1938
01:37:06,740 --> 01:37:09,740
I had a freaking heart attack there.

1939
01:37:09,740 --> 01:37:11,740
It's delta, oh my god.

1940
01:37:11,740 --> 01:37:14,740
Oh my god, thank god it let's you like lock in.

1941
01:37:16,740 --> 01:37:19,740
Woah, saved, saved, it's okay.

1942
01:37:19,740 --> 01:37:20,740
Whose heart rate is going higher?

1943
01:37:20,740 --> 01:37:22,740
Mine are yours right now, be honest.

1944
01:37:22,740 --> 01:37:25,740
How many events are there in this sporting competition

1945
01:37:25,740 --> 01:37:28,740
called a deck athelon?

1946
01:37:28,740 --> 01:37:32,740
Now, you've got an ino athelon, a duo athelon,

1947
01:37:32,740 --> 01:37:35,740
a tri athelon, a quarter athelon,

1948
01:37:35,740 --> 01:37:38,740
a quintet athelon, a six athelon,

1949
01:37:38,740 --> 01:37:41,740
a sept athelon, an octagothelon,

1950
01:37:41,740 --> 01:37:45,740
a nano-necolon, and a decathlon, which is 10.

1951
01:37:45,740 --> 01:37:46,740
Yippee.

1952
01:37:46,740 --> 01:37:47,740
I'm going to choose.

1953
01:37:47,740 --> 01:37:48,740
I tried really hard.

1954
01:37:48,740 --> 01:37:50,740
I tried so hard.

1955
01:37:50,740 --> 01:37:53,740
I didn't say anything right, but yes.

1956
01:37:54,740 --> 01:37:55,740
Yippee.

1957
01:37:56,740 --> 01:37:58,740
I see a athelon.

1958
01:37:58,740 --> 01:37:59,740
Real.

1959
01:37:59,740 --> 01:38:00,740
Okay, new question.

1960
01:38:00,740 --> 01:38:03,740
What was the name of the first?

1961
01:38:04,740 --> 01:38:06,740
Dolly the sheep.

1962
01:38:06,740 --> 01:38:07,740
I know this one.

1963
01:38:07,740 --> 01:38:11,740
Dolly the sheep was the first ever publicly revealed clone.

1964
01:38:11,740 --> 01:38:14,740
Now, just to remind you, odds are Dolly

1965
01:38:14,740 --> 01:38:18,740
and any other previous cloning was made many years ago.

1966
01:38:18,740 --> 01:38:20,740
That includes humans too.

1967
01:38:20,740 --> 01:38:22,740
And that's not tinfoil hat theory.

1968
01:38:22,740 --> 01:38:23,740
That is true.

1969
01:38:25,740 --> 01:38:28,740
Which of these is a type of computer file

1970
01:38:28,740 --> 01:38:32,740
used to customize websites for individual?

1971
01:38:32,740 --> 01:38:33,740
What?

1972
01:38:36,740 --> 01:38:37,740
What even?

1973
01:38:38,740 --> 01:38:39,740
Which of these?

1974
01:38:39,740 --> 01:38:40,740
What?

1975
01:38:40,740 --> 01:38:41,740
It's A, a cookie.

1976
01:38:41,740 --> 01:38:44,740
Oh, cookies when I ask you for your cookies.

1977
01:38:44,740 --> 01:38:45,740
Okay.

1978
01:38:45,740 --> 01:38:46,740
Thank you.

1979
01:38:46,740 --> 01:38:47,740
Thank you.

1980
01:38:47,740 --> 01:38:48,740
Sorry.

1981
01:38:48,740 --> 01:38:49,740
I'm choosing A.

1982
01:38:49,740 --> 01:38:50,740
Sorry, my bad.

1983
01:38:50,740 --> 01:38:51,740
I understand.

1984
01:38:51,740 --> 01:38:52,740
Cookies.

1985
01:38:52,740 --> 01:38:53,740
That's when you type in.

1986
01:38:53,740 --> 01:38:54,740
Be a lure.

1987
01:38:54,740 --> 01:38:57,740
You type in a Zura delay on Google search.

1988
01:38:57,740 --> 01:38:59,740
Then when you go on YouTube,

1989
01:38:59,740 --> 01:39:02,740
it'll push Azura's content to you more.

1990
01:39:02,740 --> 01:39:04,740
Yeah, that's how it works.

1991
01:39:04,740 --> 01:39:05,740
Surely.

1992
01:39:05,740 --> 01:39:08,740
And what season of the series Breaking Bad

1993
01:39:08,740 --> 01:39:12,740
does the character Saul Goodman appear for the first time?

1994
01:39:12,740 --> 01:39:17,740
I want to say season two because, you know,

1995
01:39:17,740 --> 01:39:20,740
he didn't need legal help until,

1996
01:39:20,740 --> 01:39:23,740
because season one was about a set.

1997
01:39:23,740 --> 01:39:26,740
I want to say it's two because season one's about setting up the premise,

1998
01:39:26,740 --> 01:39:29,740
but he didn't need the legal help until later, right?

1999
01:39:29,740 --> 01:39:30,740
Surely.

2000
01:39:30,740 --> 01:39:31,740
Copium.

2001
01:39:31,740 --> 01:39:32,740
I never watched it.

2002
01:39:32,740 --> 01:39:33,740
It was pretty early.

2003
01:39:33,740 --> 01:39:34,740
I can't remember B, B, B.

2004
01:39:34,740 --> 01:39:35,740
Okay, B, I'm going with you.

2005
01:39:35,740 --> 01:39:36,740
I would say B.

2006
01:39:36,740 --> 01:39:37,740
I'm going with you.

2007
01:39:37,740 --> 01:39:38,740
B.

2008
01:39:38,740 --> 01:39:39,740
I'm going with the refling.

2009
01:39:39,740 --> 01:39:41,740
Because the reflings are right.

2010
01:39:41,740 --> 01:39:42,740
That's my final answer.

2011
01:39:42,740 --> 01:39:44,740
And they're not wrong.

2012
01:39:44,740 --> 01:39:46,740
And we'll get along.

2013
01:39:46,740 --> 01:39:48,740
You have given your final answer.

2014
01:39:48,740 --> 01:39:51,740
And you'll take off my thong.

2015
01:39:51,740 --> 01:39:52,740
Okay.

2016
01:39:52,740 --> 01:39:53,740
Okay.

2017
01:39:53,740 --> 01:39:54,740
Thank you.

2018
01:39:54,740 --> 01:40:00,740
Which team eliminated Real Madrid in the Champions League of 2006?

2019
01:40:00,740 --> 01:40:01,740
Borough.

2020
01:40:01,740 --> 01:40:02,740
Barcelona.

2021
01:40:02,740 --> 01:40:07,740
Any, any football reflings?

2022
01:40:07,740 --> 01:40:08,740
Any footlings?

2023
01:40:08,740 --> 01:40:09,740
Any footlings?

2024
01:40:09,740 --> 01:40:10,740
Any footlings?

2025
01:40:10,740 --> 01:40:11,740
I'm American.

2026
01:40:11,740 --> 01:40:12,740
I don't know.

2027
01:40:12,740 --> 01:40:13,740
Okay.

2028
01:40:13,740 --> 01:40:14,740
It's so over.

2029
01:40:14,740 --> 01:40:16,740
British reflings, come on.

2030
01:40:16,740 --> 01:40:18,740
There has to be one a year.

2031
01:40:18,740 --> 01:40:20,740
Thong is Aussie for a flip-flop.

2032
01:40:20,740 --> 01:40:21,740
It is.

2033
01:40:21,740 --> 01:40:22,740
Soccerlings.

2034
01:40:22,740 --> 01:40:23,740
That's fit ball.

2035
01:40:23,740 --> 01:40:25,740
And Scots is fit ball with an I.T.

2036
01:40:25,740 --> 01:40:27,740
Like a fit ball we're done for.

2037
01:40:27,740 --> 01:40:28,740
I say A or B.

2038
01:40:28,740 --> 01:40:29,740
A or B.

2039
01:40:29,740 --> 01:40:30,740
Okay, okay.

2040
01:40:30,740 --> 01:40:31,740
Hold on.

2041
01:40:31,740 --> 01:40:32,740
We also have in-game help.

2042
01:40:32,740 --> 01:40:34,740
Let's ask the audience in-game as well.

2043
01:40:34,740 --> 01:40:35,740
Okay.

2044
01:40:35,740 --> 01:40:37,740
If you would pick up those keypads.

2045
01:40:37,740 --> 01:40:38,740
Okay.

2046
01:40:38,740 --> 01:40:40,740
We have Arsenal.

2047
01:40:40,740 --> 01:40:42,740
Did anyone think Arsenal?

2048
01:40:42,740 --> 01:40:44,740
Whatlings fit ball?

2049
01:40:44,740 --> 01:40:46,740
Did anyone think Arsenal?

2050
01:40:46,740 --> 01:40:48,740
Whatlings fitlings?

2051
01:40:48,740 --> 01:40:49,740
Like if I,

2052
01:40:49,740 --> 01:40:50,740
fit balllings,

2053
01:40:50,740 --> 01:40:51,740
we say fit.

2054
01:40:51,740 --> 01:40:52,740
Isn't it?

2055
01:40:52,740 --> 01:40:53,740
Fit ball.

2056
01:40:53,740 --> 01:40:54,740
D,

2057
01:40:54,740 --> 01:40:56,740
are we going with D?

2058
01:40:56,740 --> 01:40:57,740
Arsenal.

2059
01:40:57,740 --> 01:40:59,740
You know I heard of Arsenal before.

2060
01:40:59,740 --> 01:41:01,740
There's a football team called Arsenal.

2061
01:41:01,740 --> 01:41:02,740
Yes.

2062
01:41:02,740 --> 01:41:03,740
Literally.

2063
01:41:03,740 --> 01:41:04,740
It's called Arsenal.

2064
01:41:04,740 --> 01:41:05,740
Right.

2065
01:41:05,740 --> 01:41:06,740
Okay.

2066
01:41:06,740 --> 01:41:07,740
We're doing it.

2067
01:41:07,740 --> 01:41:08,740
I guess D.

2068
01:41:08,740 --> 01:41:09,740
Okay.

2069
01:41:09,740 --> 01:41:10,740
Whoever said D,

2070
01:41:10,740 --> 01:41:11,740
it's Ogre.

2071
01:41:11,740 --> 01:41:12,740
It's Ogre.

2072
01:41:12,740 --> 01:41:13,740
I'm a gambler.

2073
01:41:13,740 --> 01:41:14,740
And so,

2074
01:41:14,740 --> 01:41:15,740
I'm choosing D.

2075
01:41:15,740 --> 01:41:16,740
It's Ogre.

2076
01:41:16,740 --> 01:41:17,740
Is that your final?

2077
01:41:17,740 --> 01:41:18,740
Am I getting that?

2078
01:41:18,740 --> 01:41:19,740
Yes.

2079
01:41:19,740 --> 01:41:20,740
Be honest.

2080
01:41:20,740 --> 01:41:21,740
That's my final answer.

2081
01:41:21,740 --> 01:41:22,740
Be honest.

2082
01:41:22,740 --> 01:41:23,740
If this is your final answer,

2083
01:41:23,740 --> 01:41:24,740
let's hope it's the correct answer.

2084
01:41:24,740 --> 01:41:25,740
I'm Scott Senneth.

2085
01:41:25,740 --> 01:41:26,740
I watch the fit ball.

2086
01:41:26,740 --> 01:41:27,740
Okay.

2087
01:41:27,740 --> 01:41:28,740
We're safe.

2088
01:41:28,740 --> 01:41:29,740
We're safe.

2089
01:41:29,740 --> 01:41:30,740
The audience didn't tell us Fiverrini's.

2090
01:41:30,740 --> 01:41:31,740
Right.

2091
01:41:31,740 --> 01:41:32,740
Which toy are you?

2092
01:41:32,740 --> 01:41:33,740
It's said to take its name

2093
01:41:33,740 --> 01:41:34,740
from a B.

2094
01:41:34,740 --> 01:41:35,740
Corbin.

2095
01:41:35,740 --> 01:41:36,740
Oh,

2096
01:41:36,740 --> 01:41:37,740
it's a B.

2097
01:41:37,740 --> 01:41:38,740
Oh,

2098
01:41:38,740 --> 01:41:39,740
it's a B.

2099
01:41:39,740 --> 01:41:40,740
Oh,

2100
01:41:40,740 --> 01:41:41,740
it's a B.

2101
01:41:41,740 --> 01:41:42,740
Yeah.

2102
01:41:42,740 --> 01:41:43,740
It's a B.

2103
01:41:43,740 --> 01:41:44,740
It's a B.

2104
01:41:44,740 --> 01:41:45,740
One two three,

2105
01:41:45,740 --> 01:41:47,740
two one two one two,

2106
01:41:47,740 --> 01:41:49,740
two and three one two,

2107
01:41:49,740 --> 01:41:50,740
two and three.

2108
01:41:50,740 --> 01:41:51,740
I am.

2109
01:41:51,740 --> 01:41:52,740
Abacare in Connecticut.

2110
01:41:52,740 --> 01:41:53,740
A Bakery in Connecticut.

2111
01:41:53,740 --> 01:41:54,740
Any Connecticut reeflings,

2112
01:41:54,740 --> 01:41:57,740
any Connecticut

2113
01:41:57,740 --> 01:41:58,740
lings?

2114
01:41:58,740 --> 01:41:59,740
What Bakery?

2115
01:41:59,740 --> 01:42:00,740
Definitely not Lego.

2116
01:42:00,740 --> 01:42:01,740
No,

2117
01:42:01,740 --> 01:42:02,740
that's copyright by far.

2118
01:42:02,740 --> 01:42:04,960
Any Connecticut

2119
01:42:05,460 --> 01:42:06,460
lings?

2120
01:42:06,740 --> 01:42:07,740
Literally,

2121
01:42:07,740 --> 01:42:09,740
what toy you said to take its name

2122
01:42:09,740 --> 01:42:13,340
from a bakery in Connecticut.

2123
01:42:13,340 --> 01:42:15,380
Bee, a Frisbee?

2124
01:42:16,420 --> 01:42:17,540
A Frisbee?

2125
01:42:17,540 --> 01:42:20,060
Okay, we've got a few bees, we've got a few bees.

2126
01:42:20,060 --> 01:42:21,860
I'll allow it.

2127
01:42:21,860 --> 01:42:22,700
I'll allow it.

2128
01:42:24,380 --> 01:42:25,460
I've got a Frisbee.

2129
01:42:25,460 --> 01:42:26,300
Go for it.

2130
01:42:26,300 --> 01:42:27,140
Oh!

2131
01:42:29,140 --> 01:42:30,900
I'm giving you a golf clap as well.

2132
01:42:30,900 --> 01:42:33,140
Fantastic effort, leaflings.

2133
01:42:33,140 --> 01:42:35,900
I like when you use that brain power together.

2134
01:42:35,900 --> 01:42:38,340
What is the name of a puppeteer

2135
01:42:38,340 --> 01:42:40,740
that tricks Pinocchio and locks him in a kit?

2136
01:42:40,740 --> 01:42:43,180
Oh, for goodness sake, I don't even know.

2137
01:42:43,180 --> 01:42:45,380
Stromboli, isn't that a type of food?

2138
01:42:46,660 --> 01:42:49,180
Am I going mental and saying that's a type of food?

2139
01:42:50,620 --> 01:42:53,380
Wait, Stromboli's the answer?

2140
01:42:53,380 --> 01:42:56,540
I thought Stromboli was food, like ravioli.

2141
01:42:56,540 --> 01:42:59,140
Well, you guys are same seed, I'm a trustee.

2142
01:43:01,140 --> 01:43:04,420
Stromboli is the Pinocchio.

2143
01:43:04,420 --> 01:43:06,300
Has kind of root names.

2144
01:43:06,300 --> 01:43:07,620
Oh my.

2145
01:43:07,900 --> 01:43:10,340
And that's my final answer.

2146
01:43:10,340 --> 01:43:11,980
And that's my final answer.

2147
01:43:11,980 --> 01:43:13,300
Oh yeah.

2148
01:43:13,300 --> 01:43:14,220
Oh.

2149
01:43:14,220 --> 01:43:15,540
Okay, it's Stromboli.

2150
01:43:15,540 --> 01:43:17,420
Look at my refunds, oh my god.

2151
01:43:17,420 --> 01:43:18,940
We might actually win.

2152
01:43:18,940 --> 01:43:23,300
Who is our Lowe's father in the 2015 movie,

2153
01:43:23,300 --> 01:43:24,700
The Good Dinosaur?

2154
01:43:27,100 --> 01:43:29,140
Refluence, this one's for you, take it away.

2155
01:43:30,140 --> 01:43:32,220
Stromboli, are you saying a story character

2156
01:43:32,220 --> 01:43:33,420
wouldn't be named a food?

2157
01:43:34,580 --> 01:43:35,540
Something.

2158
01:43:35,540 --> 01:43:37,220
You guys are too mixed up.

2159
01:43:37,220 --> 01:43:40,980
We've got C, D and B and C again.

2160
01:43:40,980 --> 01:43:42,860
Oh my god, oh shoot, where?

2161
01:43:42,860 --> 01:43:44,100
D and C.

2162
01:43:44,100 --> 01:43:46,340
Right, okay, you guys are split.

2163
01:43:46,340 --> 01:43:49,220
You don't know this one, I don't know either.

2164
01:43:49,220 --> 01:43:50,540
Shawnee, this is Disney.

2165
01:43:50,540 --> 01:43:52,340
I ain't seen The Good Dinosaur,

2166
01:43:52,340 --> 01:43:54,180
we're like all the Dino,

2167
01:43:54,180 --> 01:43:56,900
we're like Dino dead from an asteroid.

2168
01:43:56,900 --> 01:43:57,740
Ha ha.

2169
01:43:59,380 --> 01:44:01,820
Why was that the quietest cricket I've ever done?

2170
01:44:02,780 --> 01:44:04,660
We're a phone friend, I don't know either.

2171
01:44:04,660 --> 01:44:05,500
D?

2172
01:44:06,500 --> 01:44:08,580
D, okay.

2173
01:44:08,580 --> 01:44:10,740
It looks like D's winning.

2174
01:44:12,300 --> 01:44:14,940
Oh, I was gonna say Henry sounds like D.

2175
01:44:14,940 --> 01:44:16,380
Do you want white women to help us?

2176
01:44:16,380 --> 01:44:18,300
Right, okay, white women help us.

2177
01:44:18,300 --> 01:44:20,060
You decide to play the lifeline.

2178
01:44:20,060 --> 01:44:22,140
Hydration check, replayings, okay.

2179
01:44:22,140 --> 01:44:23,740
Hope you will call the right person.

2180
01:44:25,300 --> 01:44:26,860
What is The Good Dinosaur?

2181
01:44:26,860 --> 01:44:28,380
I've got an idea, honestly,

2182
01:44:28,380 --> 01:44:30,340
your guess is as good as mine.

2183
01:44:30,340 --> 01:44:33,940
Childhood friend, Andy, surely you've watched this movie?

2184
01:44:33,940 --> 01:44:34,780
Surely.

2185
01:44:36,100 --> 01:44:37,540
Surely, copy him, copy him.

2186
01:44:37,540 --> 01:44:38,820
Good evening, Andy.

2187
01:44:38,820 --> 01:44:40,260
It's who wants to be in the-

2188
01:44:41,540 --> 01:44:44,260
He says D as well, I think you've got it then.

2189
01:44:44,260 --> 01:44:46,420
Okay, D, on route to the win.

2190
01:44:46,420 --> 01:44:47,980
Okay, I think you've got it.

2191
01:44:47,980 --> 01:44:50,060
Okay, okay, perfect.

2192
01:44:50,060 --> 01:44:51,060
That's what we like to eat.

2193
01:44:51,060 --> 01:44:52,060
Whoa!

2194
01:44:52,060 --> 01:44:53,820
And go on to the next one.

2195
01:44:53,820 --> 01:44:55,580
Oh my gosh.

2196
01:44:55,580 --> 01:44:56,420
Think of all the-

2197
01:44:56,420 --> 01:44:57,820
Take a look.

2198
01:44:57,820 --> 01:44:59,580
Think of all the food I can fatten you up with.

2199
01:44:59,580 --> 01:45:00,420
At the pace you're going,

2200
01:45:00,420 --> 01:45:02,100
you're going to make short work of this-

2201
01:45:02,100 --> 01:45:04,300
And what country makes you be served

2202
01:45:04,300 --> 01:45:06,540
a soup called Mo-

2203
01:45:06,540 --> 01:45:07,380
You know?

2204
01:45:07,380 --> 01:45:08,220
What?

2205
01:45:09,660 --> 01:45:12,100
Any ESL links?

2206
01:45:12,100 --> 01:45:13,180
Any ESL links?

2207
01:45:13,180 --> 01:45:14,020
Calling upon you.

2208
01:45:14,020 --> 01:45:15,220
ESL links?

2209
01:45:15,220 --> 01:45:16,060
Any ESL links?

2210
01:45:20,300 --> 01:45:21,300
I've got a B.

2211
01:45:22,220 --> 01:45:23,060
That's at least five.

2212
01:45:23,060 --> 01:45:26,580
A looks like Borderlands antagonist, real.

2213
01:45:26,580 --> 01:45:27,940
Check the tank, I don't live in that room.

2214
01:45:27,940 --> 01:45:29,300
We need a Filipino.

2215
01:45:29,300 --> 01:45:30,660
It's not D.

2216
01:45:30,660 --> 01:45:32,860
Okay, we've got not D.

2217
01:45:32,860 --> 01:45:34,460
We've got Charlie.

2218
01:45:35,420 --> 01:45:36,260
Lowell.

2219
01:45:36,260 --> 01:45:37,180
No, you are all right now.

2220
01:45:37,180 --> 01:45:38,460
See each other.

2221
01:45:38,460 --> 01:45:39,980
We've got three C's.

2222
01:45:39,980 --> 01:45:41,940
We've got one A thrown in there.

2223
01:45:41,940 --> 01:45:43,140
It's not looking good.

2224
01:45:43,140 --> 01:45:44,220
A C maybe?

2225
01:45:47,020 --> 01:45:48,980
We've got another C.

2226
01:45:48,980 --> 01:45:51,540
It sounds like an interesting stream.

2227
01:45:51,540 --> 01:45:53,580
It's torture, let's see.

2228
01:45:53,580 --> 01:45:55,420
Burma.

2229
01:45:55,420 --> 01:45:57,060
Burma pants, sorry.

2230
01:45:57,060 --> 01:45:57,900
Let's see.

2231
01:45:57,900 --> 01:45:59,940
A bear me's co-worker brought it in for lunch.

2232
01:45:59,940 --> 01:46:01,100
Okay.

2233
01:46:01,100 --> 01:46:03,580
Anyone who says C gets the wrong,

2234
01:46:03,580 --> 01:46:05,860
you're out of here for 10 seconds.

2235
01:46:05,860 --> 01:46:06,700
You understand me?

2236
01:46:06,700 --> 01:46:08,020
You're out of here.

2237
01:46:10,260 --> 01:46:11,220
Come on.

2238
01:46:11,220 --> 01:46:12,140
Come on Burma.

2239
01:46:13,420 --> 01:46:14,860
Come on Burma, try and go.

2240
01:46:15,740 --> 01:46:17,460
Oh my God.

2241
01:46:17,460 --> 01:46:18,780
You guys are actually gonna.

2242
01:46:20,620 --> 01:46:23,020
We're winning the million.

2243
01:46:23,020 --> 01:46:25,100
I think we're winning the million.

2244
01:46:25,100 --> 01:46:27,100
We may actually win, no way.

2245
01:46:27,100 --> 01:46:29,700
We may actually win with our collective brain power.

2246
01:46:30,260 --> 01:46:31,100
Woo!

2247
01:46:32,580 --> 01:46:35,300
Oh no, it's a TV show.

2248
01:46:35,300 --> 01:46:37,060
Well, that was close enough.

2249
01:46:37,060 --> 01:46:41,420
Where is the Glasgow Setsope River City actually filmed?

2250
01:46:45,580 --> 01:46:49,780
I didn't watch the TV, so this is useless.

2251
01:46:49,780 --> 01:46:52,380
No, it's not a strong question.

2252
01:46:52,380 --> 01:46:54,260
I don't watch the TV.

2253
01:46:56,100 --> 01:46:57,500
I don't watch the TV.

2254
01:46:57,500 --> 01:46:59,580
I didn't pay my license.

2255
01:46:59,580 --> 01:47:01,340
I didn't pay none of that.

2256
01:47:01,340 --> 01:47:02,380
River City.

2257
01:47:02,380 --> 01:47:03,220
Why would it?

2258
01:47:03,220 --> 01:47:06,900
I mean, I don't usually watch beach over streams

2259
01:47:06,900 --> 01:47:08,220
because, but this is entertainment.

2260
01:47:08,220 --> 01:47:09,580
Yeah, you're like when I shocked myself.

2261
01:47:09,580 --> 01:47:11,260
Is that when your entertainment value went up?

2262
01:47:11,260 --> 01:47:12,980
Exactly, I got you in 4K.

2263
01:47:12,980 --> 01:47:14,460
I thought you were Scottish.

2264
01:47:14,460 --> 01:47:17,780
Yes, I am, I spawned there.

2265
01:47:17,780 --> 01:47:19,180
But I didn't watch the TV.

2266
01:47:19,180 --> 01:47:20,340
I've never watched the TV.

2267
01:47:20,340 --> 01:47:22,260
I've always played video games.

2268
01:47:22,260 --> 01:47:25,540
I wanna say, please.

2269
01:47:25,540 --> 01:47:30,060
A, Dumbarton shouldn't pay for a license.

2270
01:47:30,060 --> 01:47:33,780
You have never watched the critically acclaimed TV series.

2271
01:47:33,780 --> 01:47:36,900
River City is not critically acclaimed.

2272
01:47:36,900 --> 01:47:38,380
I can tell you that much.

2273
01:47:40,100 --> 01:47:42,660
Okay, well, it's no Glasgow.

2274
01:47:42,660 --> 01:47:45,380
So pick A or C.

2275
01:47:45,380 --> 01:47:47,460
Dumbarton?

2276
01:47:47,460 --> 01:47:52,020
Dundee is like kind of like a wee bit R.A.

2277
01:47:52,020 --> 01:47:53,940
But is it a film production?

2278
01:47:53,940 --> 01:47:55,180
I don't think so.

2279
01:47:55,180 --> 01:47:56,100
You're Scottish.

2280
01:47:56,100 --> 01:47:57,620
Name every Scott right now.

2281
01:47:59,180 --> 01:48:01,820
Imagine having the license for a TV.

2282
01:48:01,820 --> 01:48:03,940
Apparently you have to do it in Japan as well.

2283
01:48:03,940 --> 01:48:05,260
I don't know.

2284
01:48:05,260 --> 01:48:06,100
I got A's.

2285
01:48:06,100 --> 01:48:07,020
I see a lot of A's.

2286
01:48:07,020 --> 01:48:08,780
I think I'm out of lifelines.

2287
01:48:08,780 --> 01:48:11,660
I can skip the question.

2288
01:48:11,660 --> 01:48:14,540
Will we skip it for when we're more caught?

2289
01:48:14,540 --> 01:48:16,620
I think we skip it and pick something

2290
01:48:16,620 --> 01:48:20,620
that we're more likely to, no, save the skip.

2291
01:48:20,620 --> 01:48:21,460
Oh my God.

2292
01:48:22,420 --> 01:48:25,620
It's, nah, A.

2293
01:48:26,820 --> 01:48:29,020
If it's no Dumbarton,

2294
01:48:29,020 --> 01:48:30,140
I know the answer.

2295
01:48:30,140 --> 01:48:32,380
If it's no Dumbarton, you're all done for.

2296
01:48:32,380 --> 01:48:33,900
And I need to fart.

2297
01:48:33,900 --> 01:48:35,340
So the next time I shock myself,

2298
01:48:35,340 --> 01:48:38,220
if you hear me fart, no one's blaming me for it, okay?

2299
01:48:38,220 --> 01:48:41,700
She wanted to use the skip on a Scottish question.

2300
01:48:41,700 --> 01:48:45,460
If it was like, name the fucking Falkirk wheel.

2301
01:48:45,460 --> 01:48:47,780
Oh, thank God it's Dumbarton.

2302
01:48:47,780 --> 01:48:48,740
Literally.

2303
01:48:48,740 --> 01:48:51,260
Oh my God, we have half a million.

2304
01:48:51,300 --> 01:48:53,060
We can literally get the castle like right now.

2305
01:48:53,060 --> 01:48:53,900
I'm not even kidding.

2306
01:48:53,900 --> 01:48:55,820
Last question, Reflins.

2307
01:48:55,820 --> 01:48:56,980
Surely.

2308
01:48:56,980 --> 01:48:58,780
Surely, Reflins.

2309
01:48:58,780 --> 01:48:59,860
Surely.

2310
01:49:00,980 --> 01:49:02,140
Oh, no farts.

2311
01:49:02,140 --> 01:49:02,980
No farts.

2312
01:49:02,980 --> 01:49:04,620
But you shouldn't stop there.

2313
01:49:04,620 --> 01:49:06,020
Here is a new question.

2314
01:49:07,780 --> 01:49:12,780
In 1985, Clive Pointon was charged with leaking details

2315
01:49:13,340 --> 01:49:18,100
of the sinking of the Belgrano to whom?

2316
01:49:19,700 --> 01:49:20,540
Who?

2317
01:49:21,380 --> 01:49:22,860
What?

2318
01:49:22,860 --> 01:49:24,220
Where?

2319
01:49:24,220 --> 01:49:25,780
When?

2320
01:49:25,780 --> 01:49:26,620
And why?

2321
01:49:27,900 --> 01:49:30,240
Skip this.

2322
01:49:30,240 --> 01:49:33,660
Literally, there has to be one autistic Reflin for the answer

2323
01:49:33,660 --> 01:49:34,900
or this is a full skip.

2324
01:49:34,900 --> 01:49:37,860
I think this is a, I think this is a full skip.

2325
01:49:37,860 --> 01:49:40,060
Literally, everyone's like who, what, where, why, when?

2326
01:49:40,060 --> 01:49:41,700
Okay, full skip.

2327
01:49:41,700 --> 01:49:43,620
So let's change the question.

2328
01:49:43,620 --> 01:49:44,940
A flip lifeline, well, you.

2329
01:49:44,940 --> 01:49:46,820
Okay, what's gonna be the new question?

2330
01:49:48,020 --> 01:49:49,260
Is it George Galway?

2331
01:49:49,260 --> 01:49:50,580
Oh no, I would have got it wrong.

2332
01:49:50,580 --> 01:49:52,940
I would have said Big George.

2333
01:49:52,940 --> 01:49:56,100
Yeah, that we hardly any of us knew what that was.

2334
01:49:56,100 --> 01:49:58,660
Okay, new last question.

2335
01:49:58,660 --> 01:50:01,900
I'm Pokemon autistic, not this autistic Real.

2336
01:50:01,900 --> 01:50:03,940
I hope you ever recovered from your emotions.

2337
01:50:03,940 --> 01:50:04,780
I've not.

2338
01:50:04,780 --> 01:50:06,100
Because here is your new question.

2339
01:50:06,100 --> 01:50:07,820
I'm a woman, sorry.

2340
01:50:07,820 --> 01:50:10,460
In the fall of 2007,

2341
01:50:10,460 --> 01:50:14,660
epiti-peti-peti-peti became which country's first astronaut?

2342
01:50:16,780 --> 01:50:19,100
Any spacelinks?

2343
01:50:19,100 --> 01:50:20,460
Any spacelinks?

2344
01:50:20,460 --> 01:50:22,180
Any nasolings?

2345
01:50:23,180 --> 01:50:26,060
Surely, surely one of us.

2346
01:50:26,060 --> 01:50:28,860
Someone says Saudi Arabia.

2347
01:50:28,860 --> 01:50:32,060
Oh, actually, from the name alone, you might be right.

2348
01:50:35,660 --> 01:50:37,980
You might be right with the name.

2349
01:50:40,740 --> 01:50:44,420
Yeah, you might be right with the name, I'm gonna be honest.

2350
01:50:44,420 --> 01:50:45,860
It's either B or C.

2351
01:50:45,860 --> 01:50:48,140
I don't, it's not an Egyptian name.

2352
01:50:49,060 --> 01:50:51,180
Okay, I'm gonna poll it and chat.

2353
01:50:51,180 --> 01:50:53,740
Wait, so people are saying A, Malaysia?

2354
01:50:56,780 --> 01:50:58,460
Don't let the name fool you.

2355
01:50:58,460 --> 01:51:02,580
Oh no, are we being stereotypical racists on a Friday night?

2356
01:51:04,660 --> 01:51:06,180
Oh, we're saying Malaysia now.

2357
01:51:06,180 --> 01:51:07,660
I see a lot of A.

2358
01:51:07,660 --> 01:51:08,500
Yeah, I see A.

2359
01:51:08,500 --> 01:51:09,700
Right, I'm gonna have to poll it.

2360
01:51:09,700 --> 01:51:11,140
Holy crap, hold on.

2361
01:51:11,140 --> 01:51:14,380
Hold on, start a poll, answer.

2362
01:51:14,380 --> 01:51:15,340
That was me if you heard that.

2363
01:51:15,340 --> 01:51:16,620
That was my desktop, not yours.

2364
01:51:16,660 --> 01:51:21,660
Answer A, B, or C.

2365
01:51:22,100 --> 01:51:24,060
Start poll, go.

2366
01:51:24,060 --> 01:51:27,500
You can now vote in a poll on, in chat.

2367
01:51:30,220 --> 01:51:34,060
Malaysia is very Arabic, is it?

2368
01:51:34,060 --> 01:51:37,340
I thought Malaysia was Asian.

2369
01:51:38,780 --> 01:51:42,060
Am I being Papago and I just don't know anything?

2370
01:51:42,060 --> 01:51:43,140
What are we looking at?

2371
01:51:43,140 --> 01:51:46,300
Oh wow, A is winning out of the wazoo.

2372
01:51:46,340 --> 01:51:48,660
All in on A, okay, all in on A.

2373
01:51:48,660 --> 01:51:50,900
I trust you with my life, Reflings.

2374
01:51:50,900 --> 01:51:52,860
Surely you wouldn't shock me.

2375
01:51:52,860 --> 01:51:53,700
You sure?

2376
01:51:54,740 --> 01:51:58,740
Oh, yes, that's my final answer.

2377
01:51:59,660 --> 01:52:02,060
Surely, surely temples.

2378
01:52:02,060 --> 01:52:04,060
If this is your final answer,

2379
01:52:04,060 --> 01:52:04,900
surely temples.

2380
01:52:04,900 --> 01:52:06,500
Let's hope it's the correct answer.

2381
01:52:08,580 --> 01:52:10,020
Yes!

2382
01:52:10,020 --> 01:52:12,340
Our freaking collective smarts!

2383
01:52:13,180 --> 01:52:18,180
Oh, our collective smarts, we did it!

2384
01:52:18,260 --> 01:52:20,820
Yes, we earned a million smakarines.

2385
01:52:20,820 --> 01:52:22,420
Now I can make the milking farm

2386
01:52:22,420 --> 01:52:23,380
and put you all to work

2387
01:52:23,380 --> 01:52:25,180
whilst we have bountiful harvest

2388
01:52:25,180 --> 01:52:27,580
and chickens and all that in the gift and stuff.

2389
01:52:27,580 --> 01:52:32,580
Oh, we did it, Reflings, you guys are so smart.

2390
01:52:33,180 --> 01:52:35,300
How dare you, how dare you be so smart.

2391
01:52:36,300 --> 01:52:38,900
Now go in hard mode, wait, is there a hard mode?

2392
01:52:40,460 --> 01:52:41,860
There's no way.

2393
01:52:41,900 --> 01:52:43,900
Is there a hard mode?

2394
01:52:43,900 --> 01:52:47,980
Solo, normal, easy and quick.

2395
01:52:47,980 --> 01:52:50,580
This game mode is mainly composed of tag.

2396
01:52:52,460 --> 01:52:54,140
Well, what do you want to do?

2397
01:52:54,140 --> 01:52:55,620
Do you want to do an easy round?

2398
01:52:55,620 --> 01:52:57,900
Do you want to do a quick round or?

2399
01:52:59,060 --> 01:53:01,660
Or will I just turn it up to 20 and hit it?

2400
01:53:01,660 --> 01:53:02,500
Be honest.

2401
01:53:04,260 --> 01:53:07,500
I need to buy quick round or hard modes?

2402
01:53:10,140 --> 01:53:11,500
Oh, sorry, I'm just looking at my leg.

2403
01:53:11,540 --> 01:53:14,220
I've got like a little, like what?

2404
01:53:16,540 --> 01:53:17,740
Oh my God.

2405
01:53:19,420 --> 01:53:21,820
My leg looks like it has chicken pox,

2406
01:53:21,820 --> 01:53:25,620
but it's the collar leaving marks.

2407
01:53:28,300 --> 01:53:31,900
Oh my God, I have marks on my leg.

2408
01:53:33,380 --> 01:53:35,420
I didn't know it did that.

2409
01:53:35,420 --> 01:53:40,100
I thought it was like a no marks left behind kind of thing.

2410
01:53:42,500 --> 01:53:44,980
Am I special needs?

2411
01:53:44,980 --> 01:53:46,180
I think I might be.

2412
01:53:49,500 --> 01:53:51,660
I didn't know they left a mark.

2413
01:53:53,740 --> 01:53:55,940
I want, right, can we just say fuck it

2414
01:53:55,940 --> 01:53:58,420
and I'll do it on 20 and if I fart, then you'll win.

2415
01:53:58,420 --> 01:54:00,180
And then that'll be the last shock.

2416
01:54:00,180 --> 01:54:02,580
Well, I'm gonna do ASMR.

2417
01:54:02,580 --> 01:54:04,060
Oh no, I'm too scared to put it up to 20.

2418
01:54:04,060 --> 01:54:05,660
I'm too much of a baby.

2419
01:54:05,660 --> 01:54:06,500
You're so special.

2420
01:54:06,500 --> 01:54:07,340
I'm terrible.

2421
01:54:07,340 --> 01:54:09,580
I have no idea what 100 would be capable of.

2422
01:54:09,580 --> 01:54:11,260
That's absolutely insane.

2423
01:54:11,300 --> 01:54:13,300
20 seems way too high.

2424
01:54:13,300 --> 01:54:14,820
Maybe the straps are too tight.

2425
01:54:14,820 --> 01:54:17,260
It's just maybe pushing into me.

2426
01:54:17,260 --> 01:54:18,860
It's what you baby, nice job, Strani.

2427
01:54:18,860 --> 01:54:21,380
We did it, we made a million.

2428
01:54:21,380 --> 01:54:22,780
Any gazillionaires?

2429
01:54:22,780 --> 01:54:24,060
Right, I'll do 15.

2430
01:54:24,060 --> 01:54:26,180
This one's for you, baby.

2431
01:54:26,180 --> 01:54:27,660
Okay, we'll do 15.

2432
01:54:27,660 --> 01:54:28,500
Okay, ready?

2433
01:54:29,580 --> 01:54:30,420
Ready?

2434
01:54:30,420 --> 01:54:33,300
If I fart, you win is crazy sentence.

2435
01:54:33,300 --> 01:54:35,980
Okay, last one and then I'm gonna go offline

2436
01:54:35,980 --> 01:54:38,060
and redirect you guys.

2437
01:54:38,060 --> 01:54:40,620
And then for those who are a member,

2438
01:54:40,620 --> 01:54:42,220
I'm going to take five minutes

2439
01:54:42,220 --> 01:54:44,100
just to set up the ASMR.

2440
01:54:44,100 --> 01:54:46,900
And then we're obviously not gonna be doing ASMR

2441
01:54:46,900 --> 01:54:49,180
if I'm shocking myself whilst trying to do,

2442
01:54:49,180 --> 01:54:51,660
you know, tingles and stuff.

2443
01:54:51,660 --> 01:54:53,420
Okay, this is 15.

2444
01:54:54,900 --> 01:54:57,460
Okay, I'll mute the background game

2445
01:54:57,460 --> 01:55:01,100
just so you can really get the full experience of my scream.

2446
01:55:01,100 --> 01:55:02,860
All right, you ready?

2447
01:55:02,860 --> 01:55:06,460
Three, I'm so nervous, my heart is beating.

2448
01:55:06,460 --> 01:55:10,460
Three, two, one.

2449
01:55:11,420 --> 01:55:14,260
I'm hesitating, I'm so scared.

2450
01:55:14,260 --> 01:55:15,260
I'm scared, right?

2451
01:55:15,260 --> 01:55:16,660
And go, go, go!

2452
01:55:18,940 --> 01:55:21,100
Oh my God, I'm hesitating so badly, I can't do it.

2453
01:55:21,100 --> 01:55:23,060
Oh my God, I need you to push the button

2454
01:55:23,060 --> 01:55:24,380
reflint unironically.

2455
01:55:24,380 --> 01:55:27,780
Right, it's kind of just blinking at me as well.

2456
01:55:27,780 --> 01:55:30,100
Right, three, two, one.

2457
01:55:31,340 --> 01:55:35,900
Okay, okay, okay, yay, I'm not doing that again.

2458
01:55:35,900 --> 01:55:38,460
Let's go right back on down, back on down.

2459
01:55:41,620 --> 01:55:44,460
I did it.

2460
01:55:44,460 --> 01:55:46,820
Just as a PSA for this stream,

2461
01:55:46,820 --> 01:55:50,780
please do not ever use shock callers on any pet or animal.

2462
01:55:50,780 --> 01:55:53,020
It is very unethical.

2463
01:55:53,020 --> 01:55:55,180
It's not very nice thing to do.

2464
01:55:55,180 --> 01:55:57,100
And the animal does not know better.

2465
01:55:57,100 --> 01:55:59,780
You're teaching a pathway of pain

2466
01:55:59,780 --> 01:56:01,620
to prevent it from doing a behavior

2467
01:56:01,620 --> 01:56:03,900
rather than doing rewarding behaviors

2468
01:56:03,900 --> 01:56:05,260
such as if it is a good-

2469
01:56:05,260 --> 01:56:06,580
Are you squidding me right now?

2470
01:56:06,580 --> 01:56:08,220
Then it's good, strongy-

2471
01:56:08,220 --> 01:56:10,260
Good girl, strongy that was in good session.

2472
01:56:10,260 --> 01:56:12,940
No, what did I even learn?

2473
01:56:14,940 --> 01:56:16,780
We'll only use the shock callers, you did good.

2474
01:56:16,780 --> 01:56:20,260
Shock callers are only for subsequent, real insurance.

2475
01:56:20,260 --> 01:56:23,300
You made it sound like getting shot from a needle.

2476
01:56:23,300 --> 01:56:28,380
It is sore, like don't do it, whatever you do, don't do it.

2477
01:56:28,380 --> 01:56:30,460
Here, how about you just fart and then sign off?

2478
01:56:30,460 --> 01:56:32,860
That would be absolute Chad behavior.

2479
01:56:32,860 --> 01:56:35,780
Can I do that on like my last ever stream?

2480
01:56:35,780 --> 01:56:37,460
I just part my cheeks on the mic

2481
01:56:37,460 --> 01:56:38,940
and just let one rip and I'll be like,

2482
01:56:38,940 --> 01:56:40,380
that one's for you, brat bros.

2483
01:56:40,380 --> 01:56:42,660
I know you were waiting an entire time.

2484
01:56:42,660 --> 01:56:44,340
The way you struggled did something to me.

2485
01:56:44,340 --> 01:56:47,020
I was like, I'll eat this, but one guy is.

2486
01:56:47,020 --> 01:56:49,780
You learned to trust Chad, I do.

2487
01:56:49,780 --> 01:56:51,420
Call them bad boys.

2488
01:56:51,420 --> 01:56:53,620
You've been a bad boy, Wiefling.

2489
01:56:53,620 --> 01:56:56,140
You've not given me enough ink supply.

2490
01:56:56,140 --> 01:56:57,900
Time for the shock caller.

2491
01:57:00,020 --> 01:57:02,100
Wait, wait, wait, wait, what?

2492
01:57:02,100 --> 01:57:03,340
Last stream, don't leave it.

2493
01:57:03,340 --> 01:57:05,620
No, I'm not leaving.

2494
01:57:05,620 --> 01:57:07,500
Stop it, you giveoes.

2495
01:57:08,500 --> 01:57:11,060
Stop it, you're gonna upset yourselves.

2496
01:57:11,060 --> 01:57:12,700
You know what it reminds me of?

2497
01:57:12,700 --> 01:57:14,060
You know what it reminds me of

2498
01:57:14,060 --> 01:57:15,860
when like children upset themselves

2499
01:57:15,860 --> 01:57:18,060
to the point they throw up?

2500
01:57:18,060 --> 01:57:21,100
That's what I think when you guys are having a carry on

2501
01:57:21,100 --> 01:57:24,020
being like, mommy's leaving, mommy's leaving.

2502
01:57:25,580 --> 01:57:28,380
Oh, sugar, she be doing a watch along yet.

2503
01:57:28,380 --> 01:57:33,060
Okay, we will see if we can redirect into someone.

2504
01:57:33,060 --> 01:57:34,020
Is anyone online?

2505
01:57:34,020 --> 01:57:36,220
Cause there's like, never anyone online when I'm online,

2506
01:57:36,220 --> 01:57:38,980
honestly, you're all getting done for.

2507
01:57:40,020 --> 01:57:41,740
You're all getting done for, okay?

2508
01:57:45,580 --> 01:57:49,060
Hold on, I'm just gonna check that this VTuber

2509
01:57:49,060 --> 01:57:51,540
isn't doing what I think she's doing.

2510
01:57:53,100 --> 01:57:54,540
If she's doing what I think she's doing,

2511
01:57:54,540 --> 01:57:56,460
unfortunately I can't redirect into her,

2512
01:57:56,460 --> 01:57:59,820
but if she's doing her own thing, that's different.

2513
01:57:59,820 --> 01:58:02,180
Hold on, I need to make sure it's muted, hold on.

2514
01:58:03,700 --> 01:58:05,180
Oh, unfortunately I can't redirect

2515
01:58:05,940 --> 01:58:07,260
into the content.

2516
01:58:08,260 --> 01:58:09,540
Okay, Raincloud is on.

2517
01:58:09,540 --> 01:58:11,660
Let's redirect into Raincloud.

2518
01:58:11,660 --> 01:58:15,500
For those who are members, give me five minutes.

2519
01:58:15,500 --> 01:58:17,300
I'm trying to redirect into someone,

2520
01:58:17,300 --> 01:58:18,500
but someone's streaming something

2521
01:58:18,500 --> 01:58:19,740
that I can't interact with.

2522
01:58:20,860 --> 01:58:21,700
I think it's up.

2523
01:58:23,100 --> 01:58:26,140
Mook Askela, thank you for coming to member.

2524
01:58:26,140 --> 01:58:28,820
For those of you who are a member,

2525
01:58:28,820 --> 01:58:32,420
I am going to set up an ASMR stream in T minus five minutes.

2526
01:58:32,420 --> 01:58:34,060
I'm gonna make a cup of tea and go for a pee,

2527
01:58:34,060 --> 01:58:35,980
maybe try and squeeze out a loaf of bread while I'm at it,

2528
01:58:35,980 --> 01:58:37,740
but I'll be five minutes.

2529
01:58:37,740 --> 01:58:40,260
I will keep the shop caller for the ASMR.

2530
01:58:40,260 --> 01:58:41,260
I don't know how it's gonna go,

2531
01:58:41,260 --> 01:58:43,300
but it's gonna go all right.

2532
01:58:43,300 --> 01:58:45,060
Thank you so, so much for tuning in.

2533
01:58:45,060 --> 01:58:45,900
I had so much fun.

2534
01:58:45,900 --> 01:58:50,500
I will see you goofy givers tomorrow for endurance.

2535
01:58:52,340 --> 01:58:55,980
We might get 99 cooking in RuneScape tomorrow.

2536
01:58:55,980 --> 01:58:57,700
You're welcome to hang out with me.

2537
01:58:57,700 --> 01:59:00,260
We'll be in Edgeville Bank as always.

2538
01:59:00,260 --> 01:59:01,740
We'll be edging in Edgeville.

2539
01:59:02,740 --> 01:59:04,420
I'll see you tomorrow.

2540
01:59:04,420 --> 01:59:05,260
Please don't worry.

2541
01:59:05,260 --> 01:59:08,620
No, don't throw up because you're sad now.

2542
01:59:08,620 --> 01:59:09,460
Okay, right.

2543
01:59:09,460 --> 01:59:10,820
I'll see you tomorrow.

2544
01:59:10,820 --> 01:59:11,980
And if you're a member,

2545
01:59:11,980 --> 01:59:13,180
I'll see you in five minutes

2546
01:59:13,180 --> 01:59:16,540
after I've tried to squeeze out a little baguette.

2547
01:59:16,540 --> 01:59:17,340
Thank you for the tips,

2548
01:59:17,340 --> 01:59:19,140
Ronnie's trainer, outrageous comment,

2549
01:59:19,140 --> 01:59:20,500
but very funny and I like that.

2550
01:59:20,500 --> 01:59:22,220
So there you go.

2551
01:59:22,220 --> 01:59:23,220
I'll see you tomorrow,

2552
01:59:23,220 --> 01:59:24,740
but first things first.

2553
01:59:32,580 --> 01:59:34,220
Did you enjoy me shocking myself?

2554
01:59:34,220 --> 01:59:35,580
Be honest.

2555
01:59:35,580 --> 01:59:37,180
And I'll give you another kiss.

2556
01:59:39,540 --> 01:59:40,380
Be honest.

2557
01:59:45,060 --> 01:59:47,620
Teal, thank you for coming on a member.

2558
01:59:47,620 --> 01:59:49,220
You did, I knew it.

2559
01:59:49,220 --> 01:59:50,460
I'm on to you.

2560
01:59:50,460 --> 01:59:53,540
I'm on to you, but I'll get ready for my ASMR stream

2561
01:59:53,540 --> 01:59:54,700
for membership, okay?

2562
01:59:54,700 --> 01:59:56,220
I'll be back, but see you tomorrow.

2563
01:59:56,220 --> 01:59:57,380
If I don't see you through a window,

2564
01:59:57,380 --> 02:00:00,340
I'll see you while you're wanking in your bed.

2565
02:00:00,340 --> 02:00:01,940
Love you, bye, Reflings.
