1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,200
Oh my dear dear reflin, what am I gonna do?

2
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:10,200
I'm all over the shop right now, I'm all bent backwards and out of shape and doing a backflip.

3
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:17,200
Sorry, I apologise. Good morning, darling. Vod watch, I hope you're well.

4
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:27,200
Right, gimme up gimme up gimme up.

5
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:30,200
Alright, what's the game called? It's called Elden Ring. Of course it's called Elden Ring.

6
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:33,200
God, Elden Ring is massive. Like, the size of the sails.

7
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:42,200
I'm connecting my controller. I forgot to disconnect yesterday so it's probably a battery.

8
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:47,200
I'm the sort of battery. I'm the sort of battery. I'm the sort of battery. I'm the sort of battery.

9
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:49,200
Shut up shut up. I'm the sort of battery.

10
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:51,200
Where is it? I'm the sort of battery.

11
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:53,200
Stop! Where is it? I'm the sort of battery.

12
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:56,200
Help! Please help. Help! Help! I can't tell! Oh, I can't tell!

13
00:00:57,200 --> 00:01:01,200
Right, right, OK, OK, I got it. I got it, I got it. It was fucking high.

14
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:04,200
It's sorry. It was, I was hiding.

15
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:10,200
Good day of work. Good morning and good evening, and good afternoon.

16
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:15,200
Use Dyskords all over the end game. Absolutely fucking out. Why is it showing that.

17
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:18,200
Get the fire shit, is it cos I was...

18
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:22,200
Huh. My streamer mode's enabled. That shouldn't have come up.

19
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:25,400
mommy, the mommy verse, mommy's asking for help

20
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:30,360
um, hello reflans, did you manage to catch my catherina collab?

21
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:33,640
or was it too early? don't worry if you didn't catch it, it might have been too early

22
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:36,360
hold on, I'll unpin it, because, well I'm here now

23
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:41,480
and I need to pin, multi-player, oh that's all capitals

24
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:46,040
multi-bruh, catherina is so fucking nice, multi-player password

25
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:49,240
she literally just sent me that she's got an appointment for the doctor

26
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:52,520
I swear to god if my autism fucking diagnosed someone, holy shit

27
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:56,520
I'm unstoppable, I am unstoppable

28
00:01:56,520 --> 00:02:01,320
wait, hold on, did I just mod someone by accident?

29
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:06,280
did I just mod you? no, it would have changed your symbol

30
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:11,000
I almost accidentally just modded a refling at random

31
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:16,440
multi-player or multi-player, more like melting the bosses because we don't do a

32
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:22,440
single thing, oh my goodness, lucky lord, mod on stream?

33
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:27,960
no, sorry I missed it yesterday, I was on my phone, no don't apologize

34
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:32,280
I completely forgot about it, I was at family breakfast, itadakimasu, is it yum-yum

35
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:37,480
in your tum-tum? the refling has risen, I'll take more

36
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:41,320
okay so if you weren't here for yesterday's agendination, please don't

37
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:48,440
we have completed the dlc, we currently are very naughty and have the

38
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:53,800
frenzied flame in us and we are going to remove the frenzied

39
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:58,680
flame because I didn't want to burn my fair maiden

40
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:03,480
half fee, hi, oh yeah

41
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:09,960
I got to keep my organs on the condition that

42
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:20,280
Katarina gets a correct diagnosis, that is the reason I was allowed to escape

43
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:23,160
unharmed because we were talking about organ harvesting, I'm like well I do

44
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:25,720
technically have three hearts if you need an extra one

45
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:30,280
no I missed the dlc, did you enjoy it? it was so good, we unfortunately came across

46
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:35,720
the glitch where the boss died

47
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:38,840
instantly so I had to get summoned into a refling's game which was actually very

48
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:44,040
very lucky, I should fast travel to frozen lake

49
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:47,640
or the freezing, you should travel to the frozen lake grace if you want to go to

50
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:50,440
the castle, okay freezing lake it is, sorry to make that

51
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:55,960
refling move that was just there, hi, yeah oh my god Katarina is a hoot in a

52
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:59,640
fucking holler, I felt so bad though she was like

53
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:03,240
oh you actually watched my content or like you actually looked into me and I'm

54
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:06,440
like yeah do your co-op partners not look into you?

55
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:10,600
like do they not, like I don't know, try and have fun like I asked I was like oh

56
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:13,480
what's your community name and she's like Cess and I was like oh mine's

57
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:18,440
reflings, and I was just like talking

58
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:21,640
away about yuster and I was like oh and you

59
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:25,080
know they're really happy we play Elton Ray like all that kind of thing

60
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:29,560
and yeah she's doing great things for the feature of her community, oh

61
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:33,400
Katarina is so precious she was like but she burped so loudly when we

62
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:37,000
I felt so emasculated sorry I felt like a pipsqueak of a man I'm sorry I've never

63
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,040
been more embarrassed I was like I can't even I can't even I don't have a

64
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:43,160
comeback for this I genuinely don't

65
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:46,520
um

66
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:50,040
you're literally the last name in my list from yesterday but there's only two

67
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:52,760
golden if there's only two golden it means

68
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:57,800
that there's only there is no way you're the last one

69
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:02,280
just a few have you heard she did with Emmys

70
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:06,280
I heard the start of Emmys one I couldn't finish it in time

71
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:09,160
that that's the only thing that annoys me about

72
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:12,840
um being a streamer I don't have time to catch everything so they were talking

73
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:18,120
about makeup um they were talking about makeup

74
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:21,400
with emmy and it was like if you could take away like one bit of makeup I'm

75
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:24,760
like so to peel the curtains behind

76
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:26,840
the back of it I don't think Katarina's gonna spank me

77
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:33,880

257
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:26,040
yeah unfortunately today is not an endurance I'm just warning you now

258
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:29,080
don't get too invested my voice is absolutely short and have a bit of

259
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:32,920
background work to do um shebe's got a shebe wants a youtube

260
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:35,560
roleplay script I'm not really quite sure what to give her

261
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:39,080
I asked her where she was interested in um and I just said I can just give you

262
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:41,800
plots that um I believe will be popular

263
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:47,240
because her newest asmr did not do well but it has all the elements of stuff

264
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:51,720
that has done well so it was rather surprising like rather

265
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:56,520
rather surprising um sorry you've not had a chance today

266
00:19:56,520 --> 00:20:01,000
um I literally had all the elements of a

267
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:05,480
good audio are you gab you're not gab gab are you here

268
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:09,640
there you are gab you get shot and then if you want to become an enemy

269
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:13,800
refling able wait what

270
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:18,200
sorry are you an enemy

271
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:24,520
are you an enemy uh won't know until we start connecting

272
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:27,720
what haha what i'm suffered internet wait which is my

273
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:32,280
basically she be no not a live stream a roleplay

274
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:35,960
oh your enemy refling oh okay okay okay able me to

275
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:39,560
right okay that makes much more sense I was like hmm how did I get

276
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:44,760
three green ones in three golden ones in uh

277
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:49,080
she be um oh my god I I don't have live chat on

278
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:53,320
I swear if I missed any refling messages because I had freaking top chat on

279
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:59,000
I hate top chat I want live chat I want to see everything

280
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:03,400
um right let me finish my cup of tea but yeah she be uploaded a new asmr

281
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:08,280
roleplay video on youtube not a live stream um and I had all the elements

282
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:12,760
that um have been rather successful uh had I known

283
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:16,280
um and the video just like did absolutely shy saw

284
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:19,640
and I can't even make sense heads or tails of why not

285
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:23,720
so we're currently ab thumbnail testing it

286
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:28,440
um it's up to her if she wants to discuss why we are thumbnail ab testing it

287
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:30,600
and

288
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:36,120
how does top chat work top chat hates anything that might be bad

289
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:42,680
repetitive or offensive basically so I can't see when you claim you want to

290
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:45,880
ink to me and you want to ink all over me okay

291
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:50,280
bro that club with katharina was so good let's just like you have a bikini top

292
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:54,520
boom both of us in bikinis out of nowhere boom just like that

293
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:58,520
mm the algorithm does what it does

294
00:21:58,520 --> 00:22:03,160
literally it was terrible I was very surprised and shocked at the same time

295
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:06,440
um I felt really bad because she be put so much effort into it now she has

296
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:10,680
fixed her microphone settings from that recording session

297
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:14,120
so the next one she uploads I'm gonna again I'm gonna try and pick a popular

298
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:17,000
roleplay I I'm gonna see if I can get her to

299
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:21,480
do a guide and we'll stick our review to remodel on the

300
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:24,840
asset from this she keeps shooting

301
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:28,360
I think it would be cute if it was like a guy who tingles you she has done a

302
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:30,680
live stream like that but I want to turn it into a roleplay because I think it's

303
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:33,320
quite isn't it

304
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:37,240
it should have stayed in the bikini longer I wasn't finished

305
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:41,240
honestly katharina's model is really good I like the detail

306
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:45,320
top chat also hides any responses that v-tubers do because they're repeated

307
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:49,720
messages I find impressive that these

308
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:54,360
reeflands can play with one hand how do you know I'm not oh wait

309
00:22:54,360 --> 00:23:00,200
oh I was gonna say I'm doing the foot method but that doesn't count

310
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:05,000
right my little reason what and what are you ready

311
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:12,360
are you ready for an adventure yeah okay take me take me um

312
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:16,040
yes today's gonna be a wee bit smaller for streams

313
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:19,880
my foot the classic well you're like play one handed and I'm like

314
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:23,480
yeah I don't I dare say

315
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:30,680
um I ruined my what's your secret hidden talent

316
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:34,360
for katharina she was like don't tell me what it is

317
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:37,720
I want to find out live but then I kind of when she was like what's the most

318
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:41,800
outrageous thing you've done this year ow as if I just got me

319
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:46,840
um I kind of blew it I blew the surprise

320
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:51,000
but I can officially say I clapped my cheeks for another feature bro

321
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:58,680
ah Michael I can't take shit I can't get it that was glorious I'll look on her

322
00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:01,720
face oh she's a hoot and a holler

323
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:05,400
honestly I'm definitely interested in putting a pubg team

324
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:07,880
together just so I can play with her more

325
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:12,600

361
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:14,760
earlier um I probably did six hours I did

362
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:19,320
oh I was kind of having to very quickly write notes together to

363
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:25,240
scrap um to scramble for the the audio editing team

364
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:32,760
basically it was a rather rubbish it's a bit of a pathetic attempt I'm afraid

365
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:39,080
wait did we just do a 360 I think there's a big old crab here

366
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:43,720

367
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:52,440

371
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:17,800

372
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:21,080

373
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:23,720
yes and no

374
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:29,480
um obviously I still do my own stuff because that's my preference

375
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:33,640
um I don't want anyone really doing my stuff because

376
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:37,880
I like my hands on approach um

377
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:41,080
I I fucked up sending away the audio so snowberries and

378
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:45,240
a snowberries are fucked up but after the snowberries batch is done

379
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:48,840
um then yes I am officially off of it which

380
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:52,040
um that batch is going to be done within like two days really

381
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:55,960
and then that's it we done so what am I to do here sorry am I supposed to do

382
00:28:55,960 --> 00:29:00,440
something or pick something up oh there's a guy under the rock

383
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:05,720
oh what do I do here do we get progressed on right okay we'll progress on

384
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:10,360
I'm following you I'm following you sorry so yeah 48 hours it's like I don't

385
00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:13,320
I don't touch anyone's patreons now though I just need to hand off the

386
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:16,680
information that's what is holding up but

387
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:20,440
obviously I streamed for 12 hours so as you can imagine trying to put a

388
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:26,120
document together to explain how like what what my my what I was

389
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:29,400
doing and putting it right in it down and what they need to do next yeah was

390
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:33,240
rather um hard to kind of string a sentence together

391
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:37,960
very very difficult wouldn't recommend um

392
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:46,280
and then oh jeez uh see yes with a long no and no in a roundabout yes yeah

393
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:51,560
unfortunately this literally hurts it's like

394
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:57,320
so I just need ac to get in place and then yes that's it but the only reason

395
00:29:57,320 --> 00:30:00,280

480
00:36:34,040 --> 00:36:38,360
it just like take away like deep fried or whatever makes it better like

481
00:36:38,360 --> 00:36:41,560
if it's home cooked food like a healthy perception

482
00:36:41,560 --> 00:36:45,480
of it then it doesn't really excite me that much

483
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:49,480
but if it's like greasy take away food

484
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:59,320

if you use assassin gambit you can light the things without being

688
00:54:06,360 --> 00:54:12,440
attacked huh what

689
00:54:13,720 --> 00:54:17,160
later without being attacked

690
00:54:20,520 --> 00:54:24,680
well like right now or when that reflin leaves

691
00:54:24,680 --> 00:54:27,880
he's just shown me the location so there's one at the start there's this

692
00:54:27,880 --> 00:54:30,440
one I can't come

693
00:54:30,440 --> 00:54:34,280
right okay hold on hold on I'm a little slower

694
00:54:34,840 --> 00:54:40,600
when he leaves okay so we'll climb the tower the one on the bottom square

695
00:54:40,600 --> 00:54:45,080
go once you've finished the tower go along the rooftop assassin's creed

696
00:54:45,080 --> 00:54:47,320
style

697
00:54:48,920 --> 00:54:52,920
to the blue ladder okay

698
00:54:53,640 --> 00:54:57,480
and then we'll meet the third one

699
00:54:57,800 --> 00:55:02,040
okay oh my god this is a lot of traversing for me

700
00:55:02,040 --> 00:55:04,840
uh oh

701
00:55:06,920 --> 00:55:09,640
come down

702
00:55:13,640 --> 00:55:16,840
ah okay okay

703
00:55:19,080 --> 00:55:24,120
yes I'm on pc sorry I had to send this journey

704
00:55:24,200 --> 00:55:30,920
cheeks clapping earlier what happened I was asked what my like hidden talent is

705
00:55:30,920 --> 00:55:34,520
and I was like I can clap without my hands so you don't have to give a show

706
00:55:34,520 --> 00:55:38,600
okay this is the third one then where's the fourth one

707
00:55:38,600 --> 00:55:45,560
over there did it go on the root no I'm gonna follow this reflin

708
00:55:45,960 --> 00:55:50,360
like it snow ahead

709
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:53,480
go that way

710
00:55:54,360 --> 00:55:58,600
roll onto this building

711
00:55:58,760 --> 00:56:03,960
uh I don't know how loud it was clapping was it was loud for me I believe

712
00:56:03,960 --> 00:56:07,640
I didn't want to I you know I didn't want to overstay it's fucking welcome

713
00:56:07,640 --> 00:56:12,680
uh okay okay okay okay okay so the one on the ground

714
00:56:12,680 --> 00:56:16,920
then the blue ladder is pretty much uh is the

715
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:20,040
the task okay and this is the fourth and the last one

716
00:56:20,040 --> 00:56:23,480
surely I'm not gonna get frustrated mess this up

717
00:56:23,480 --> 00:56:31,240
surely copy them surely surely and I can also roll onto this apparently

718
00:56:32,440 --> 00:56:35,960
okay right and we're back at the start right so

719
00:56:35,960 --> 00:56:39,480
where's that fourth one that was on the ground it was back there somewhere

720
00:56:39,480 --> 00:56:43,960
I'm sure I'll find the ground one rather relatively easy honestly

721
00:56:44,040 --> 00:56:49,800

long range as much as I want to I really should actually learn how to play

01:05:56,760 --> 01:05:59,960
magic in this game you'd think after like what my third

825
01:05:59,960 --> 01:06:02,680

861
01:09:00,440 --> 01:09:04,120
spawning in to fall off a tree does not count as a as a shot to play with me

862
01:09:04,120 --> 01:09:09,400
okay I'm just saying that now I'm saying that now

863
01:09:09,400 --> 01:09:14,600

uh you don't look lonely okay let's go

865
01:09:18,520 --> 01:09:25,640
the smell 300 has a lot of slow motion I read

866
01:09:25,640 --> 01:09:28,360
somewhere that if they had all the slow motion played in

867
01:09:28,360 --> 01:09:32,440
the movie would be 30 minutes longer oh did they just have like really good

868
01:09:32,440 --> 01:09:35,400
scenes like that whoa

869
01:09:36,040 --> 01:09:40,680
get off the map I don't know well

870
01:09:40,920 --> 01:09:44,680
you're braver than me I was backing up

871
01:09:45,320 --> 01:09:48,600
okay down the stairs gently well it's not full

872
01:09:48,600 --> 01:09:54,200

873
01:09:55,160 --> 01:10:02,520
whoa what are you doing oh oh come on I hit first

874
01:10:04,360 --> 01:10:07,000
here we go

875
01:10:07,640 --> 01:10:12,200
I remember when uh the hobbit came out and they were showing scenes of the

876
01:10:12,200 --> 01:10:17,720
I said that's not Lauren Dell what the frickin the the place that begins with L

877
01:10:17,720 --> 01:10:21,800
um and everyone was like there's no

878
01:10:21,800 --> 01:10:29,000
like uh how you call it balcony like the wood that goes beside the balcony

879
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:33,320
riflin did you trigger that plan where are you

880
01:10:33,320 --> 01:10:35,960
are we in trouble

881
01:10:37,640 --> 01:10:40,520
I'm to come this way

882
01:10:42,520 --> 01:10:45,320
jump scare

883
01:10:46,760 --> 01:10:49,880
right let's get rid of this

884
01:10:50,520 --> 01:10:56,840
mmm railing that's the word yeah yeah yeah like they would on say sorry I've

885
01:10:56,840 --> 01:11:02,840
just completely lost the inability to uh speak today like say words and things

886
01:11:02,840 --> 01:11:09,400
and stuff and it's all gone no recollection

887
01:11:09,400 --> 01:11:12,760
300 was written and illustrated by Frank Miller who did since that he

888
01:11:12,760 --> 01:11:17,640
the Zack Schneider directed it uh the only movie he made that was good in my

889
01:11:17,640 --> 01:11:21,160
opinion and your humble opinion oh I'm picking up the I am

890
01:11:21,160 --> 01:11:26,520
are you whipping us you think come here oh the point got it I got it I touched it

891
01:11:26,520 --> 01:11:29,080
to see the point

892
01:11:31,640 --> 01:11:35,080
maybe

893
01:11:35,800 --> 01:11:49,400
you're whipping oh what oh didn't we not have to like kill these weird snails

894
01:11:49,400 --> 01:11:53,240

895
01:11:53,240 --> 01:11:56,120
the snails or something

896
01:11:58,200 --> 01:12:02,680

897
01:12:02,760 --> 01:12:08,840
MLG how did you make that jump that seems so long I fucking okay it's fine I

922
01:14:11,720 --> 01:14:15,240

923
01:14:15,240 --> 01:14:20,520
uh I'm not uh normally sorry I know you're waiting on me in game I'm sorry

924
01:14:20,520 --> 01:14:24,520
I'm sorry boom there we go the reason I'm so excited about

925
01:14:24,520 --> 01:14:29,400
stream snipe this week is because you get to stream snipe me and

926
01:14:29,400 --> 01:14:34,280
she be we're playing life for dead two together so both

927
01:14:34,280 --> 01:14:38,120
harem and reeflings can join in with us in game

928
01:14:38,120 --> 01:14:43,240
we're genuinely doing a stream snipe game together I'm so excited

929
01:14:43,240 --> 01:14:48,040
and I'm gonna do my handcam Lego set building I'm gonna literally I'm

930
01:14:48,040 --> 01:14:52,840
getting my nails done today and I don't know what color I should get I

931
01:14:52,840 --> 01:14:59,320
don't know if I should get alternate in colors of nails

932
01:14:59,320 --> 01:15:02,600
are you gonna be doing versus mode no you're gonna come play it with us

933
01:15:02,600 --> 01:15:06,280
you're gonna I've never played life for dead two so she's gonna

934
01:15:06,280 --> 01:15:13,320
help me through it um now there's no membership ASMR however

935
01:15:13,320 --> 01:15:18,440
there's two ASMR streams this week and

936
01:15:19,560 --> 01:15:24,200
I'm gonna play chain together solo I know the irony the the whole point of it is

937
01:15:24,200 --> 01:15:27,640
to not do it solo but there there's a very easy screenshot if you want to

938
01:15:27,640 --> 01:15:30,840
screenshot it and then have a little analysis of it

939
01:15:30,840 --> 01:15:34,200
how long will left for dead two last I might not be able to catch a person

940
01:15:34,200 --> 01:15:39,640
um it is completely depend not to put any pressure on sheevy

941
01:15:39,640 --> 01:15:43,720
but um I have quite a lot of stamina for stream sniping

942
01:15:43,720 --> 01:15:48,840
um are you okay are you consoling each other what's going on

943
01:15:48,840 --> 01:15:53,720
really funny okay um whoa

944
01:15:53,960 --> 01:16:00,040
definitely um I don't want to pressure sheevy to stream too long but uh

945
01:16:00,040 --> 01:16:03,080
the way it's going to be done is through my stream sniping account

946
01:16:03,080 --> 01:16:06,280
um because I don't think she has one and I would like her to be super

947
01:16:06,280 --> 01:16:08,840
safe um so here I'm and reeflings can add me through

948
01:16:08,840 --> 01:16:13,480
my stream snip account um if I wish to continue on forth

949
01:16:13,480 --> 01:16:20,760
um I will where's reefling right root reeflings going this way

950
01:16:20,760 --> 01:16:27,240

Thank you for lending your hand.

1281
01:45:06,080 --> 01:45:08,080
What's wrong?

1282
01:45:08,080 --> 01:45:11,080
I could not have defeated that quartet.

1283
01:45:11,080 --> 01:45:15,080
I feel as if I've been in your debt from beginning to end.

1284
01:45:15,080 --> 01:45:17,080
Thank you.

1285
01:45:17,080 --> 01:45:22,080
With your help, I was able to live as my own person.

1286
01:45:22,080 --> 01:45:26,080
If only in passing.

1287
01:45:26,080 --> 01:45:29,080
But this is where things end.

1288
01:45:29,080 --> 01:45:32,080
I was supposed to even tell you.

1289
01:45:32,080 --> 01:45:36,080
But I took out the needle myself.

1290
01:45:36,080 --> 01:45:40,080
Tell whoever put you up to this

1291
01:45:40,080 --> 01:45:44,080
that if I am to flower into something

1292
01:45:44,080 --> 01:45:46,080
other than myself,

1293
01:45:46,080 --> 01:45:49,080
I would rather rot into nothingness as I am.

1294
01:45:49,080 --> 01:45:51,080
Oh, what?

1295
01:45:51,080 --> 01:45:53,080
Please.

1296
01:45:53,080 --> 01:45:55,080
Let me pass alone.

01:45:55,080 --> 01:45:58,080
The scarlet dropped right now.

1298
01:45:58,080 --> 01:46:00,080
Worse than ever.

01:46:01,080 --> 01:46:04,080

01:46:04,080 --> 01:46:06,080
Cursed lady.

1302
01:46:06,080 --> 01:46:08,080
Untouchable.

1303
01:46:08,080 --> 01:46:12,080
I wouldn't want such a thing to bring you home.

1304
01:46:12,080 --> 01:46:14,080
Please.

1305
01:46:14,080 --> 01:46:15,080

Cursed lady.

1307
01:46:16,080 --> 01:46:17,080
I wouldn't want.

1308
01:46:17,080 --> 01:46:18,080
Okay, okay.

1309
01:46:18,080 --> 01:46:20,080
Oh.

1310
01:46:20,080 --> 01:46:23,080
You didn't have to die.

1311
01:46:26,080 --> 01:46:28,080
Namco.

1312
01:46:36,080 --> 01:46:38,080
Oh, she didn't have to die.

1313
01:46:38,080 --> 01:46:41,080
Sorry, I'm a bit sleepy today.

1314
01:46:41,080 --> 01:46:43,080
Oh.

1315
01:46:43,080 --> 01:46:46,080
She's going to be like a puddle of flesh now.

1316
01:46:46,080 --> 01:46:47,080
Oh, fuck.

1317
01:46:47,080 --> 01:46:50,080
She passed away.

1318
01:46:50,080 --> 01:46:52,080
Oh.

1319
01:46:52,080 --> 01:46:55,080
Old and young.

1320
01:46:55,080 --> 01:46:57,080
Visions of love.

1321
01:46:57,080 --> 01:46:59,080
Love will love.

1322
01:46:59,080 --> 01:47:02,080
Old and more.

1323
01:47:02,080 --> 01:47:07,080
Teleport to drainage channel.

1324
01:47:07,080 --> 01:47:09,080
Does that have that unlock?

1325
01:47:09,080 --> 01:47:11,080
No, I do.

1326
01:47:11,080 --> 01:47:12,080
This is the sad souls.

1327
01:47:12,080 --> 01:47:13,080
Everyone is dying.

1328
01:47:13,080 --> 01:47:15,080
She didn't have to die.

1329
01:47:15,080 --> 01:47:17,080
Grim dark souls war.

1330
01:47:17,080 --> 01:47:18,080
Honestly.

1331
01:47:18,080 --> 01:47:20,080
Wait, did I go to the right place?

1332
01:47:20,080 --> 01:47:22,080
Yeah, I did.

1333
01:47:22,080 --> 01:47:24,080
Is that something you said?

1334
01:47:27,080 --> 01:47:29,080
Am I supposed to do something?

1335
01:47:29,080 --> 01:47:30,080
Say no more.

1336
01:47:30,080 --> 01:47:32,080
You don't have to tell me twice.

1337
01:47:32,080 --> 01:47:33,080
Right.

1338
01:47:33,080 --> 01:47:36,080
Who's not had a shock today?

1339
01:47:36,080 --> 01:47:38,080
I swear you're the other one.

1340
01:47:38,080 --> 01:47:39,080
Carpet bomb.

1341
01:47:39,080 --> 01:47:40,080
Did you lag out?

1342
01:47:40,080 --> 01:47:42,080
You did.

1343
01:47:42,080 --> 01:47:45,080
You're the other one that lagged out, so you don't count.

1344
01:47:52,080 --> 01:47:55,080
Over zero, you fell off, so yeah.

1345
01:47:55,080 --> 01:47:57,080
You don't count either.

1346
01:48:01,080 --> 01:48:03,080
And then who's my enemy?

1347
01:48:03,080 --> 01:48:05,080
Oh, my enemy.

1348
01:48:05,080 --> 01:48:07,080
Smart.

1349
01:48:07,080 --> 01:48:09,080
He's a bumblebee.

1350
01:48:10,080 --> 01:48:12,080
I have a pen that has four different colours.

1351
01:48:12,080 --> 01:48:15,080
If you're wondering if you ever hear a click in the background,

1352
01:48:15,080 --> 01:48:17,080
I write the enemy Wiefling's name in red,

1353
01:48:17,080 --> 01:48:21,080
so I know not to count you as like an actual person I called in,

1354
01:48:21,080 --> 01:48:25,080
because it's not the same when you can't like, hit stuff.

1355
01:48:25,080 --> 01:48:27,080
It's a bit different, yeah?

1356
01:48:27,080 --> 01:48:28,080
Yeah, we can hear it.

1357
01:48:28,080 --> 01:48:30,080
Sorry, it's a four coloured pen.

1358
01:48:30,080 --> 01:48:34,080
It has green, blue, red and black on it.

1359
01:48:34,080 --> 01:48:36,080
What ending are you going for?

1360
01:48:36,080 --> 01:48:41,080
I want to cure myself of the frenzied flame to show my maiden

1361
01:48:41,080 --> 01:48:43,080
that I did it for her,

1362
01:48:43,080 --> 01:48:47,080
and that I didn't do it because I'm lost to madness.

1363
01:48:47,080 --> 01:48:48,080
I did it for her.

1364
01:48:48,080 --> 01:48:50,080
So, I'm going to be Elden Lord,

1365
01:48:50,080 --> 01:48:52,080
because I've never done the Elden Lord ending.

1366
01:48:52,080 --> 01:48:54,080
I've done Rani's ending.

1367
01:48:55,080 --> 01:48:57,080
And did we Makarani's ending?

1368
01:48:59,080 --> 01:49:01,080
And now I want to become the Elden Lord,

1369
01:49:01,080 --> 01:49:03,080
because I've not done that one,

1370
01:49:03,080 --> 01:49:05,080
where I just sit on the chair.

1371
01:49:05,080 --> 01:49:07,080
I assume it's the sit on the chair one.

1372
01:49:09,080 --> 01:49:10,080
Does she know?

1373
01:49:10,080 --> 01:49:11,080
What?

1374
01:49:11,080 --> 01:49:13,080
I'm getting rid of the frenzied flame.

1375
01:49:13,080 --> 01:49:15,080
What do you mean does she know?

1376
01:49:17,080 --> 01:49:19,080
I got rid of it, so she's alive.

1377
01:49:19,080 --> 01:49:21,080
Don't say does she know.

1378
01:49:21,080 --> 01:49:23,080
No, she doesn't know.

1379
01:49:27,080 --> 01:49:29,080
I think she's talking because you pissed her.

1380
01:49:29,080 --> 01:49:30,080
No, she's alive.

1381
01:49:30,080 --> 01:49:31,080
Fuck you.

1382
01:49:31,080 --> 01:49:33,080
No, I did her a favour.

1383
01:49:33,080 --> 01:49:34,080
I'm to go all the-

1384
01:49:34,080 --> 01:49:36,080
Oh, right, okay, one at a time, one at a time.

1385
01:49:39,080 --> 01:49:40,080
She'll forgive me.

1386
01:49:40,080 --> 01:49:41,080
Whoa!

1387
01:49:42,080 --> 01:49:46,080
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1388
01:49:46,080 --> 01:49:48,080
Oh my god, carpet bomb died?

1389
01:49:48,080 --> 01:49:50,080
No, there's no way I'm counting that.

1390
01:49:51,080 --> 01:49:53,080
Sorry, I'm taking your name off again.

1391
01:49:53,080 --> 01:49:55,080
There's no way I'm counting that.

1392
01:49:56,080 --> 01:49:58,080
Oh, I got Talisman.

1393
01:49:59,080 --> 01:50:01,080
Sorry, let me take your name off the list.

1394
01:50:01,080 --> 01:50:03,080
That does not count as an attempt.

1395
01:50:03,080 --> 01:50:04,080
Nice try though.

1396
01:50:06,080 --> 01:50:08,080
That's a very good talent.

1397
01:50:09,080 --> 01:50:10,080
I believe it.

1398
01:50:12,080 --> 01:50:14,080
Let's get out of here.

1399
01:50:15,080 --> 01:50:17,080
A booty fly.

1400
01:50:18,080 --> 01:50:19,080
What would you want?

1401
01:50:22,080 --> 01:50:24,080
You are my gating star, everyone.

1402
01:50:24,080 --> 01:50:26,080
You are my gating star, everyone.

1403
01:50:29,080 --> 01:50:30,080
Oh, I missed.

1404
01:50:30,080 --> 01:50:31,080
You didn't see that.

1405
01:50:31,080 --> 01:50:33,080
That was so embarrassing.

1406
01:50:38,080 --> 01:50:40,080
Don't these guys cause lead damage?

1407
01:50:40,080 --> 01:50:41,080
Or am I going crazy?

1408
01:50:42,080 --> 01:50:43,080
Oh, whoa.

1409
01:50:44,080 --> 01:50:45,080
Careful what you wish for!

1410
01:50:48,080 --> 01:50:50,080
Careful what you wish for.

1411
01:50:50,080 --> 01:50:52,080
Careful what you wish for.

1412
01:50:56,080 --> 01:50:58,080
I'm not that I wish for it.

1413
01:50:58,080 --> 01:50:59,080
Okay, I'm ready.

1414
01:50:59,080 --> 01:51:00,080
Sorry about that.

1415
01:51:00,080 --> 01:51:01,080
Oh, chap.

1416
01:51:02,080 --> 01:51:03,080
Shall we?

1417
01:51:07,080 --> 01:51:08,080
What to do now?

1418
01:51:12,080 --> 01:51:14,080
I'm already letting them feel.

1419
01:51:14,080 --> 01:51:16,080
How much health have you got?

1420
01:51:17,080 --> 01:51:19,080
How much health have you got?

1421
01:51:19,080 --> 01:51:21,080
I'm really healing you slowly.

1422
01:51:23,080 --> 01:51:26,080
I'm healing you slowly, so slowly.

1423
01:51:27,080 --> 01:51:31,080
I have my reef length, my reef length.

1424
01:51:32,080 --> 01:51:34,080
To call my own.

1425
01:51:34,080 --> 01:51:35,080
Oh, no.

1426
01:51:45,080 --> 01:51:47,080
Okay, let's try that again.

1427
01:51:47,080 --> 01:51:48,080
Who's not going to try?

1428
01:51:49,080 --> 01:51:51,080
Don't die.

1429
01:51:51,080 --> 01:51:53,080
I have to write your name one more time.

1430
01:51:53,080 --> 01:51:55,080
Don't fucking die.

1431
01:51:55,080 --> 01:51:56,080
Do you understand me?

1432
01:51:56,080 --> 01:51:57,080
That's an order.

1433
01:51:58,080 --> 01:52:00,080
That's the third time I've wrote your name.

1434
01:52:00,080 --> 01:52:01,080
Don't die.

1435
01:52:01,080 --> 01:52:02,080
Don't disconnect.

1436
01:52:02,080 --> 01:52:03,080
Don't crash my game.

1437
01:52:03,080 --> 01:52:04,080
What's the message?

1438
01:52:09,080 --> 01:52:10,080
We're going for the Ranny End?

1439
01:52:10,080 --> 01:52:13,080
No, I've never not done the Ranny End.

1440
01:52:13,080 --> 01:52:16,080
So I'm just going to make myself Elden Lord for one.

1441
01:52:17,080 --> 01:52:18,080
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

1442
01:52:18,080 --> 01:52:20,080
Yeah, yeah, you better be sorry.

1443
01:52:21,080 --> 01:52:22,080
Spank, spank, spank.

1444
01:52:24,080 --> 01:52:25,080
Don't crash my game.

1445
01:52:26,080 --> 01:52:27,080
Oh, it's a fight!

1446
01:52:28,080 --> 01:52:30,080
Oh, what's behind door number one?

1447
01:52:30,080 --> 01:52:31,080
Operation exists.

1448
01:52:31,080 --> 01:52:42,500
this. Okay, ready? Let's see. I can't remember what this fate is. I remember this fate! Oh

1449
01:52:42,500 --> 01:52:54,560
no. Oh no, this can't be. Okay. Oh no, this can't be. Have fun. It's up to the reasons

1450
01:52:54,560 --> 01:53:08,600
to have fun. Mmm. I remember. I just helped your sister. She's got all the faith on you.

1451
01:53:08,600 --> 01:53:21,120
No I do. Because that Scarlet wrote fucking it out. It's tearing her up. Well you'd be

1452
01:53:21,120 --> 01:53:31,120
legs to the arms, to the prosthetics. You chicken nugget boss. What a level am I? 200?

1453
01:53:31,120 --> 01:53:38,480
In like 17 or something? Does that mean I'm good at games? No. Oh! She really said

1454
01:53:39,480 --> 01:53:53,400
My flesh was dull gold and my blood rotted. Corpse after corpse left in my wake. She's still

1455
01:53:53,400 --> 01:54:21,520
conscious. Elden Lord? I don't know Elden Lord. Okay. Uh huh. Uh huh. And I will be your shield.

1456
01:54:23,400 --> 01:54:52,400
Monka? And I have never known defeat. Yeah, until today. Make take me a few attempts. Oh my God! Relax, relax. This is embarrassing. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, back off, back off, back off, my cock, off my cock, off my cock, off my cock. Off it, off it, off it, enough, enough.

1457
01:54:53,400 --> 01:55:15,400
Fuck. She have high poise. She's better not. Get off it. Oh, I lost that girl. Well, hold on to me. Oh my gosh. Okay, so she can be staggered. That's the fantastic news. Like truly fantastic. But I need my stamina to come back.

1458
01:55:16,400 --> 01:55:35,400
Okay, let me back off. Let me back off. Oh, you got frost damage. Nice. Ah, how did I get caught up in the wake of that? None to do with me. Take this. Take this. Take this.

1459
01:55:35,400 --> 01:55:57,400
Pop, pop, pop, pop, pop. Get wall banged. Get wall banged. Hold on. I need hydrate. I need hydrate. Take Agro. Hold on. Right, I'm coming in. I'm coming in. That was me. That was me. It was all me, baby. It was all me. Right, okay. And I'm for the butterfly part. I remember the butterfly part. Okay.

1460
01:56:05,400 --> 01:56:11,400
Really damn, she really dead, didn't she? Phase two. Fight.

1461
01:56:20,400 --> 01:56:28,400
What am I looking at exactly? She's so sweet. Looks like a tree, a bit of bark. Love one.

1462
01:56:35,400 --> 01:56:41,400
She really said, it's right behind you, isn't it?

1463
01:56:44,400 --> 01:56:46,400
Is the music the leader?

1464
01:56:56,400 --> 01:57:00,400
Oh, I love how beautiful this design was.

1465
01:57:06,400 --> 01:57:10,400
Oh, our bibs out. Wait, is that a-

1466
01:57:15,400 --> 01:57:17,400
Sorry, I had to zoom in there.

1467
01:57:18,400 --> 01:57:23,400
Is that? No. It's a scarlet roll, wink, wink.

1468
01:57:25,400 --> 01:57:29,400
Did I not register this the first time I played through this game?

1469
01:57:30,400 --> 01:57:36,400
Wood. I don't- Oh my God, I forgot all the attack patterns.

1470
01:57:41,400 --> 01:57:47,400
What is she doing? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Get ranny'd. Get ranny'd. Get ranny'd.

1471
01:57:47,400 --> 01:57:52,400
Oh, get ranny'd so hard. Oh, pick up someone else.

1472
01:57:52,400 --> 01:58:03,400
Someone else. Oh, I missed. Oh my God. Is that why I thought the design was so beautiful? She ain't got nothing on?

1473
01:58:05,400 --> 01:58:07,400
Honestly real, though.

1474
01:58:11,400 --> 01:58:13,400
What does this do?

1475
01:58:14,400 --> 01:58:19,400
Whoa. I assume if you're in the blossom, you get scarlet root tissue.

1476
01:58:20,400 --> 01:58:23,400
And that's why it has such a-

1477
01:58:26,400 --> 01:58:32,400
Oh, we're swinging. We're swinging in unison. We're sinking up. Oh, not quite.

1478
01:58:33,400 --> 01:58:36,400
Hold on, let's keep it safe. Let's keep it right.

1479
01:58:37,400 --> 01:58:39,400
Oh, we're doing it. Oh.

1480
01:58:43,400 --> 01:58:46,400
At least she complimented us. Most of it.

1481
01:58:46,400 --> 01:58:48,400
The true Lord.

1482
01:58:48,400 --> 01:58:50,400
Literally, most of the-

1483
01:58:52,400 --> 01:58:56,400
Most of the Lord, like when we kill the Lords on the way out,

1484
01:58:57,400 --> 01:59:01,400
they all are like, oh, you're not fit, tarnished, you're not this, you're not that.

1485
01:59:01,400 --> 01:59:10,400
My brother. I'm sorry. I finally met my man.

1486
01:59:12,400 --> 01:59:17,400
They're always like all insulting, like you can't do this, you can't do that, you can't do this, you can't do that.

1487
01:59:17,400 --> 01:59:21,400
This is the first boss that's like, oh well. Yeah, you're gonna be Elden Lord.

1488
01:59:22,400 --> 01:59:24,400
Yeah, you didn't win.

1489
01:59:26,400 --> 01:59:28,400
Is it okay? Excuse me.

1490
01:59:29,400 --> 01:59:34,400
I think only Melania and Joff Godfrey compliments you.

1491
01:59:34,400 --> 01:59:37,400
Now you have to reload the area. See no more of them.

1492
01:59:37,400 --> 01:59:39,400
Quit the game.

1493
01:59:39,400 --> 01:59:42,400
I'm level 225, oh my god.

1494
01:59:42,400 --> 01:59:45,400
Just a cheeky bit a little bit, yeah.

1495
01:59:50,400 --> 01:59:53,400
So, I'm probably gonna go for a little cheeky nap.

1496
01:59:54,400 --> 01:59:56,400
After screen.

1497
01:59:56,400 --> 02:00:01,400
And then I'm gonna get my nails did, I'm gonna be a girl.

1498
02:00:01,400 --> 02:00:03,400
And then I'll take pictures.

1499
02:00:03,400 --> 02:00:04,400
Oh my god, I should take pictures.

1500
02:00:04,400 --> 02:00:07,400
Sheevee did that, hold on a minute. Sheevee kind of kicked.

1501
02:00:07,400 --> 02:00:12,400
She got her nails done and then she took a picture of it wrapped around a figurine.

1502
02:00:12,400 --> 02:00:15,400
And I was like, hmm, smart.

1503
02:00:15,400 --> 02:00:18,400
But none of my figurines have arrived yet, so I can't really do that.

1504
02:00:18,400 --> 02:00:22,400
I think, I think bad bagging takes a whole second.

1505
02:00:22,400 --> 02:00:24,400
Right, I'm reloaded the area.

1506
02:00:26,400 --> 02:00:28,400
Oh, you're new, hello.

1507
02:00:30,400 --> 02:00:31,400
Hi.

1508
02:00:31,400 --> 02:00:34,400
Return on a Lloyd gold needle?

1509
02:00:37,400 --> 02:00:38,400
I've returned the needle.

1510
02:00:41,400 --> 02:00:42,400
Return.

1511
02:00:42,400 --> 02:00:46,400
Okay, Makilia's needle and a smithing stone.

1512
02:00:47,400 --> 02:00:49,400
Insert the needle into it.

1513
02:00:49,400 --> 02:00:51,400
Plop, plop, plop, plop, getting started.

1514
02:00:51,400 --> 02:00:52,400
Plop, plop, plop, plop, plop.

1515
02:00:52,400 --> 02:00:54,400
Okay, now I did.

1516
02:00:56,400 --> 02:00:59,400
Now it's off to Farham, Azure.

1517
02:01:00,400 --> 02:01:03,400
Gosh, I can't remember any of these location names.

1518
02:01:05,400 --> 02:01:07,400
What is this one?

1519
02:01:11,400 --> 02:01:12,400
This one?

1520
02:01:13,400 --> 02:01:15,400
Farham, Farham, Azure Delay, see no more.

1521
02:01:16,400 --> 02:01:19,400
Godwin is chill with you sitting on the Elden Throne

1522
02:01:19,400 --> 02:01:22,400
because the Tarnished are descendants of Godwin's soldiers,

1523
02:01:22,400 --> 02:01:24,400
his dad's army.

1524
02:01:24,400 --> 02:01:26,400
Aw, that's nice.

1525
02:01:28,400 --> 02:01:32,400
I'm glad that there's some people that accept the Tarnished.

1526
02:01:34,400 --> 02:01:37,400
So are we basically just a rank one soldier,

1527
02:01:37,400 --> 02:01:40,400
a blade of a rifling, so what name?

1528
02:01:40,400 --> 02:01:42,400
Are we just basically a rank one soldier,

1529
02:01:42,400 --> 02:01:45,400
and that's why everyone's been really mean to us.

1530
02:01:50,400 --> 02:01:52,400
And that's why, and they're like,

1531
02:01:52,400 --> 02:01:54,400
oh, they hate you.

1532
02:01:54,400 --> 02:01:56,400
They're like, oh, I'm sorry.

1533
02:01:57,400 --> 02:01:59,400
You played at the stars.

1534
02:01:59,400 --> 02:02:01,400
Are there any other riflings that haven't had a chance to do?

1535
02:02:06,400 --> 02:02:08,400
Never go.

1536
02:02:08,400 --> 02:02:10,400
Shieldmaster, you've not had a chance.

1537
02:02:13,400 --> 02:02:15,400
Shieldmaster.

1538
02:02:15,400 --> 02:02:19,400
That honestly just sounds like another title for a turtle.

1539
02:02:20,400 --> 02:02:22,400
And what animal is this?

1540
02:02:22,400 --> 02:02:24,400
It's a shieldmaster, of course.

1541
02:02:25,400 --> 02:02:27,400
He wants to be the naughty with one.

1542
02:02:27,400 --> 02:02:29,400
We're not royally put it that way.

1543
02:02:29,400 --> 02:02:31,400
You are cannon fodder.

1544
02:02:31,400 --> 02:02:33,400
Oh, that makes sense.

1545
02:02:33,400 --> 02:02:35,400
People are so resistant.

1546
02:02:35,400 --> 02:02:38,400
Cannon fodder cannot become Elden Lord.

1547
02:02:38,400 --> 02:02:40,400
And I was like, ah, okay, thank you.

1548
02:02:43,400 --> 02:02:45,400
Don't have to be so rude about that.

1549
02:02:45,400 --> 02:02:47,400
Like, I'm just trying my best.

1550
02:02:47,400 --> 02:02:49,400
Seriously.

1551
02:02:49,400 --> 02:02:52,400
Just a little undead little guy.

1552
02:02:53,400 --> 02:02:55,400
You'll have to kill one more optional boss for the cure,

1553
02:02:55,400 --> 02:02:57,400
and then you can finish the game.

1554
02:02:57,400 --> 02:02:59,400
Okay, tell me what boss to kill.

1555
02:02:59,400 --> 02:03:01,400
I'll do it.

1556
02:03:01,400 --> 02:03:04,400
I want to cure myself of the frenzied flame.

1557
02:03:06,400 --> 02:03:08,400
I won't make a good game.

1558
02:03:08,400 --> 02:03:10,400
We're curing myself of the frenzied flame,

1559
02:03:10,400 --> 02:03:14,400
and then you need to kill the king of dragons.

1560
02:03:15,400 --> 02:03:17,400
Parathrax!

1561
02:03:18,400 --> 02:03:22,400
Oh, my heart just fell out of me throat.

1562
02:03:22,400 --> 02:03:24,400
Oh, my God.

1563
02:03:24,400 --> 02:03:26,400
I'm okay, though.

1564
02:03:26,400 --> 02:03:28,400
I thought it was ogre.

1565
02:03:28,400 --> 02:03:30,400
I thought it was ogre.

1566
02:03:30,400 --> 02:03:32,400
I'm not even kidding.

1567
02:03:32,400 --> 02:03:34,400
Is that dragon gonna lock onto me?

1568
02:03:36,400 --> 02:03:38,400
That made my heart jump, too.

1569
02:03:38,400 --> 02:03:40,400
What do I get for reading and playing video game

1570
02:03:40,400 --> 02:03:42,400
at the same technology?

1571
02:03:42,400 --> 02:03:44,400
You are basically a random NPC,

1572
02:03:44,400 --> 02:03:46,400
and everyone's mad that an NPC's going...

1573
02:03:46,400 --> 02:03:48,400
They're like, damn, this wasn't in the code.

1574
02:03:48,400 --> 02:03:50,400
Fuck.

1575
02:03:50,400 --> 02:03:52,400
I've touched it.

1576
02:03:54,400 --> 02:03:56,400
Let's go.

1577
02:03:56,400 --> 02:03:59,400
Parathrax and Beal 1v1 each of them.

1578
02:04:01,400 --> 02:04:04,400
Oh, this place just creeps me out so much.

1579
02:04:04,400 --> 02:04:06,400
I'm so glad I'm super overleveled for this area.

1580
02:04:06,400 --> 02:04:08,400
Teehee.

1581
02:04:10,400 --> 02:04:12,400
And now nothing can scare me.

1582
02:04:12,400 --> 02:04:14,400
Wink wink.

1583
02:04:14,400 --> 02:04:16,400
There are three boss fights here.

1584
02:04:16,400 --> 02:04:18,400
I know there's a jewel in this area.

1585
02:04:18,400 --> 02:04:20,400
I don't know the other ones.

1586
02:04:22,400 --> 02:04:24,400
I missed. That was embarrassing.

1587
02:04:24,400 --> 02:04:26,400
Whoa!

1588
02:04:26,400 --> 02:04:28,400
I'll just pray it's friendly.

1589
02:04:32,400 --> 02:04:34,400
Yeah, damn.

1590
02:04:36,400 --> 02:04:38,400
Jew, Micoleth, and Parathrax.

1591
02:04:38,400 --> 02:04:40,400
I'm gonna just...

1592
02:04:40,400 --> 02:04:42,400
Oh!

1593
02:04:42,400 --> 02:04:44,400
Something just walloped me from there.

1594
02:04:44,400 --> 02:04:46,400
Who was that?

1595
02:04:46,400 --> 02:04:48,400
Rude.

1596
02:04:48,400 --> 02:04:50,400
Okay, where do we go?

1597
02:04:50,400 --> 02:04:52,400
Where do we go?

1598
02:04:52,400 --> 02:04:54,400
I don't know.

1599
02:04:54,400 --> 02:04:56,400
A ball bearing.

1600
02:05:00,400 --> 02:05:02,400
Whoa, really?

1601
02:05:02,400 --> 02:05:04,400
Hmm.

1602
02:05:04,400 --> 02:05:06,400
Huh.

1603
02:05:08,400 --> 02:05:10,400
That's a lot.

1604
02:05:12,400 --> 02:05:14,400
Look at them jumping behind a rock.

1605
02:05:14,400 --> 02:05:16,400
Go.

1606
02:05:16,400 --> 02:05:18,400
Naughty.

1607
02:05:18,400 --> 02:05:20,400
Naughty!

1608
02:05:20,400 --> 02:05:22,400
They're like blending in my idols.

1609
02:05:24,400 --> 02:05:26,400
You can just hear these balls.

1610
02:05:26,400 --> 02:05:28,400
Ding-a-ling-a-ling.

1611
02:05:28,400 --> 02:05:30,400
Ding-a-ling-a-ling.

1612
02:05:30,400 --> 02:05:32,400
Ow.

1613
02:05:32,400 --> 02:05:34,400
That poor riflin is getting...

1614
02:05:34,400 --> 02:05:36,400
Oh, my God, mean riflin or bumpingy.

1615
02:05:36,400 --> 02:05:38,400
Oh, okay. That was really dangerous.

1616
02:05:38,400 --> 02:05:40,400
But we got...

1617
02:05:40,400 --> 02:05:42,400
Whoa!

1618
02:05:42,400 --> 02:05:44,400
I'm gonna just run ahead, okay?

1619
02:05:44,400 --> 02:05:46,400
Rifling, no!

1620
02:05:46,400 --> 02:05:48,400
Can you make it out of a rifling?

1621
02:05:48,400 --> 02:05:50,400
Are you fine? Are you safe?

1622
02:05:50,400 --> 02:05:52,400
Jeez.

1623
02:05:52,400 --> 02:05:54,400
Jump, and then jump.

1624
02:05:54,400 --> 02:05:56,400
And then clean the site.

1625
02:05:56,400 --> 02:05:58,400
What are you bumping?

1626
02:05:58,400 --> 02:06:00,400
Hmm.

1627
02:06:04,400 --> 02:06:06,400
I have to keep my cock with the rock.

1628
02:06:08,400 --> 02:06:10,400
Whoa!

1629
02:06:10,400 --> 02:06:12,400
That was a bit dramatic.

1630
02:06:12,400 --> 02:06:14,400
Okay, I missed. Two of us can do that.

1631
02:06:14,400 --> 02:06:16,400
Ow.

1632
02:06:16,400 --> 02:06:18,400
As if we could do that move.

1633
02:06:18,400 --> 02:06:20,400
Don't you align me.

1634
02:06:20,400 --> 02:06:22,400
Such a cheat sheet of horror.

1635
02:06:22,400 --> 02:06:24,400
Whoa!

1636
02:06:24,400 --> 02:06:26,400
Okay.

1637
02:06:28,400 --> 02:06:30,400
Are you serious?

1638
02:06:30,400 --> 02:06:32,400
Stop aiming for the riflin.

1639
02:06:32,400 --> 02:06:34,400
Aim for the enemy that's, like, point blank, maybe?

1640
02:06:34,400 --> 02:06:36,400
Jeez.

1641
02:06:36,400 --> 02:06:38,400
Pillage corpse.

1642
02:06:38,400 --> 02:06:40,400
I'll pillage the fucker in that corpse.

1643
02:06:42,400 --> 02:06:44,400
Uh, we do...

1644
02:06:44,400 --> 02:06:46,400
What now?

1645
02:06:46,400 --> 02:06:48,400
Is this not where the twin's here?

1646
02:06:50,400 --> 02:06:52,400
We're about to do the twin...

1647
02:06:52,400 --> 02:06:54,400
Riflings, I hope you know how to win this fight

1648
02:06:54,400 --> 02:06:56,400
because I don't remember a thing about it, okay?

1649
02:06:56,400 --> 02:06:58,400
I will go forth.

1650
02:07:00,400 --> 02:07:02,400
Don't! No, don't!

1651
02:07:02,400 --> 02:07:04,400
Do that.

1652
02:07:04,400 --> 02:07:06,400
That's scary.

1653
02:07:06,400 --> 02:07:08,400
Am I not...

1654
02:07:08,400 --> 02:07:10,400
Oh! I was like, it's not working.

1655
02:07:10,400 --> 02:07:12,400
Alright, what are their attacks again?

1656
02:07:12,400 --> 02:07:14,400
Oh no, he does, like, a circle spiral thing!

1657
02:07:16,400 --> 02:07:18,400
The big one does the circle spiral

1658
02:07:18,400 --> 02:07:20,400
that you can't, like, cheese.

1659
02:07:20,400 --> 02:07:22,400
You just, like, forever get to.

1660
02:07:24,400 --> 02:07:26,400
Oh, you put them to sleep?

1661
02:07:26,400 --> 02:07:28,400
Was that supposed to?

1662
02:07:30,400 --> 02:07:32,400
Oh, they're molly.

1663
02:07:34,400 --> 02:07:36,400
Are you putting them to sleep?

1664
02:07:40,400 --> 02:07:42,400
This is what we're supposed to do?

1665
02:07:42,400 --> 02:07:44,400
I hope, anyway.

1666
02:07:44,400 --> 02:07:46,400
Now, walk his ass up!

1667
02:07:46,400 --> 02:07:48,400
Oh my god, I'm dying.

1668
02:07:48,400 --> 02:07:50,400
Please don't pick on me.

1669
02:07:50,400 --> 02:07:52,400
I'm tiny.

1670
02:07:52,400 --> 02:07:54,400
I'm so cute and...

1671
02:07:54,400 --> 02:07:56,400
That's what I remember!

1672
02:07:56,400 --> 02:07:58,400
Oh, you put back to sleep!

1673
02:08:02,400 --> 02:08:04,400
I'm helping, I'm helping.

1674
02:08:04,400 --> 02:08:06,400
Helping to wake his ass up.

1675
02:08:06,400 --> 02:08:08,400
Okay, then it's the skinny one.

1676
02:08:08,400 --> 02:08:10,400
Go away.

1677
02:08:10,400 --> 02:08:12,400
He's scaring us.

1678
02:08:14,400 --> 02:08:16,400
Ah, no, only Amelot to use magic.

1679
02:08:16,400 --> 02:08:18,400
Do you believe in magic?

1680
02:08:20,400 --> 02:08:22,400
I don't even think you need to put him to sleep anymore.

1681
02:08:24,400 --> 02:08:26,400
Well, our last one spawns in.

1682
02:08:30,400 --> 02:08:32,400
He's E.P. He is E.P.

1683
02:08:34,400 --> 02:08:36,400
Oh, there we go.

1684
02:08:36,400 --> 02:08:38,400
Sorry, the trap.

1685
02:08:38,400 --> 02:08:40,400
Oh, I need to...

1686
02:08:40,400 --> 02:08:42,400
I'm out.

1687
02:08:42,400 --> 02:08:44,400
Oh, wait, hold on.

1688
02:08:44,400 --> 02:08:46,400
Let me chug this real quick.

1689
02:08:50,400 --> 02:08:52,400
Oh, he's getting him!

1690
02:08:54,400 --> 02:08:56,400
I remember...

1691
02:08:56,400 --> 02:08:58,400
Oh, I need to heal.

1692
02:08:58,400 --> 02:09:00,400
Hold on.

1693
02:09:00,400 --> 02:09:02,400
Let me heal.

1694
02:09:02,400 --> 02:09:04,400
Oh, I did it. See, I did the final blow.

1695
02:09:04,400 --> 02:09:06,400
Well, I was in the corner of the room,

1696
02:09:06,400 --> 02:09:08,400
super safe. No, I did the final blow.

1697
02:09:08,400 --> 02:09:10,400
What are you talking about?

1698
02:09:10,400 --> 02:09:12,400
It was all me, baby.

1699
02:09:12,400 --> 02:09:14,400
It was all me.

1700
02:09:16,400 --> 02:09:18,400
You're killing them too fast.

1701
02:09:18,400 --> 02:09:20,400
Oh, no, we...

1702
02:09:20,400 --> 02:09:22,400
We are so overleveled for this.

1703
02:09:22,400 --> 02:09:24,400
We're so so overleveled.

1704
02:09:24,400 --> 02:09:26,400
I need to go on the left or right.

1705
02:09:26,400 --> 02:09:28,400
Left or right?

1706
02:09:28,400 --> 02:09:30,400
This way?

1707
02:09:30,400 --> 02:09:32,400
This way?

1708
02:09:32,400 --> 02:09:34,400
Kind of looks like this way.

1709
02:09:34,400 --> 02:09:36,400
Surely.

1710
02:09:36,400 --> 02:09:38,400
What are you...

1711
02:09:38,400 --> 02:09:40,400
There's another grace site, which means more leaflings!

1712
02:09:42,400 --> 02:09:44,400
Hello, Mr. Grace site.

1713
02:09:44,400 --> 02:09:46,400
It's a pleasure to meet you.

1714
02:09:46,400 --> 02:09:48,400
Please, no, no, allow me.

1715
02:09:48,400 --> 02:09:50,400
Bring my children to me.

1716
02:09:50,400 --> 02:09:52,400
Wrong way, damn it.

1717
02:09:52,400 --> 02:09:54,400
Okay, let me level up.

1718
02:09:54,400 --> 02:09:56,400
That it?

1719
02:09:56,400 --> 02:09:58,400
Sure, I'm just going to max out on health,

1720
02:09:58,400 --> 02:10:00,400
because...

1721
02:10:00,400 --> 02:10:02,400
What does it matter at this point?

1722
02:10:02,400 --> 02:10:04,400
Oh, my God, I have an extra tier thing as well.

1723
02:10:04,400 --> 02:10:06,400
A flask.

1724
02:10:06,400 --> 02:10:08,400
It was a 50-50.

1725
02:10:08,400 --> 02:10:10,400
And we got there in the end.

1726
02:10:12,400 --> 02:10:14,400
Oh, it's Gimli!

1727
02:10:14,400 --> 02:10:16,400
And my axe.

1728
02:10:16,400 --> 02:10:18,400
And my axe.

1729
02:10:18,400 --> 02:10:20,400
How is there a summon thing here?

1730
02:10:20,400 --> 02:10:22,400
Why is there only one leafling?

1731
02:10:22,400 --> 02:10:24,400
Is there another point here where you guys are?

1732
02:10:24,400 --> 02:10:26,400
Hmm?

1733
02:10:26,400 --> 02:10:28,400
Is it here?

1734
02:10:28,400 --> 02:10:30,400
I don't see it.

1735
02:10:30,400 --> 02:10:32,400
Hmm?

1736
02:10:32,400 --> 02:10:34,400
Hmm?

1737
02:10:34,400 --> 02:10:36,400
Hmm?

1738
02:10:36,400 --> 02:10:38,400
Hmm?

1739
02:10:38,400 --> 02:10:40,400
Is it here? I don't see it.

1740
02:10:40,400 --> 02:10:42,400
Hmm?

1741
02:10:42,400 --> 02:10:44,400
Hmm?

1742
02:10:44,400 --> 02:10:46,400
Can you guide me? Do you know where to go?

1743
02:10:46,400 --> 02:10:48,400
Why are we stealthing?

1744
02:10:48,400 --> 02:10:50,400
And then we can get more leaflings

1745
02:10:50,400 --> 02:10:52,400
and then at the next point, wherever it is?

1746
02:10:54,400 --> 02:10:56,400
Oh.

1747
02:10:56,400 --> 02:10:58,400
Oh, that's way too early.

1748
02:10:58,400 --> 02:11:00,400
No!

1749
02:11:00,400 --> 02:11:02,400
Close enough, close enough.

1750
02:11:02,400 --> 02:11:04,400
Okay.

1751
02:11:04,400 --> 02:11:06,400
You just point us in the right direction.

1752
02:11:06,400 --> 02:11:08,400
I'm...

1753
02:11:08,400 --> 02:11:10,400
Like...

1754
02:11:10,400 --> 02:11:12,400
Yeah.

1755
02:11:12,400 --> 02:11:14,400
I'm going to, like, super health out.

1756
02:11:14,400 --> 02:11:16,400
Even though the drip was real.

1757
02:11:16,400 --> 02:11:18,400
You jump over here?

1758
02:11:18,400 --> 02:11:20,400
Gentle.

1759
02:11:20,400 --> 02:11:22,400
Gentle.

1760
02:11:22,400 --> 02:11:24,400
And then we get...

1761
02:11:24,400 --> 02:11:26,400
Whoa!

1762
02:11:26,400 --> 02:11:28,400
Stop it!

1763
02:11:28,400 --> 02:11:30,400
With my...

1764
02:11:30,400 --> 02:11:32,400
Hmm?

1765
02:11:32,400 --> 02:11:34,400
Okay.

1766
02:11:34,400 --> 02:11:36,400
Huh?

1767
02:11:36,400 --> 02:11:38,400
Oh!

1768
02:11:38,400 --> 02:11:40,400
Someone's ahead!

1769
02:11:40,400 --> 02:11:42,400
Hi, leafling!

1770
02:11:42,400 --> 02:11:44,400
Who's here?

1771
02:11:44,400 --> 02:11:46,400
You're a fucking snake in the fucker, though.

1772
02:11:48,400 --> 02:11:50,400
Leafling?

1773
02:11:50,400 --> 02:11:52,400
Oh!

1774
02:11:52,400 --> 02:11:54,400
You almost died!

1775
02:11:54,400 --> 02:11:56,400
See, this is why you can't be away from mommy too long.

1776
02:11:56,400 --> 02:11:58,400
You almost died!

1777
02:11:58,400 --> 02:12:00,400
Don't do that again.

1778
02:12:00,400 --> 02:12:02,400
You scared me. Don't do it again.

1779
02:12:02,400 --> 02:12:04,400
Is that leafling coming in?

1780
02:12:04,400 --> 02:12:06,400
I have backup.

1781
02:12:06,400 --> 02:12:08,400
See, look, I brought backup.

1782
02:12:08,400 --> 02:12:10,400
We're all safe now.

1783
02:12:10,400 --> 02:12:12,400
Hmm.

1784
02:12:12,400 --> 02:12:14,400
What's up here?

1785
02:12:14,400 --> 02:12:16,400
Okay.

1786
02:12:16,400 --> 02:12:18,400
Okay.

1787
02:12:18,400 --> 02:12:20,400
See?

1788
02:12:20,400 --> 02:12:22,400
First of all, you need me.

1789
02:12:22,400 --> 02:12:24,400
I just came in clutch for you.

1790
02:12:24,400 --> 02:12:26,400
What?

1791
02:12:26,400 --> 02:12:28,400
Here?

1792
02:12:28,400 --> 02:12:30,400
Something incredible ahead.

1793
02:12:30,400 --> 02:12:32,400
What?

1794
02:12:32,400 --> 02:12:34,400
We go back down?

1795
02:12:36,400 --> 02:12:38,400
Huh?

1796
02:12:38,400 --> 02:12:40,400
Huh? I'm literally that cat meme right now.

1797
02:12:40,400 --> 02:12:42,400
Huh?

1798
02:12:42,400 --> 02:12:44,400
Huh?

1799
02:12:44,400 --> 02:12:46,400
Okay.

1800
02:12:46,400 --> 02:12:48,400
I don't know how you guys, like,

1801
02:12:48,400 --> 02:12:50,400
remember it as well, being like,

1802
02:12:50,400 --> 02:12:52,400
I don't know what step comes next.

1803
02:12:52,400 --> 02:12:54,400
Or do you have the wiki open right now?

1804
02:12:54,400 --> 02:12:56,400
Be honest.

1805
02:12:56,400 --> 02:12:58,400
Do you have the wiki open to get rid of my scarlet rot?

1806
02:13:00,400 --> 02:13:02,400
Oh, no, not scarlet rot.

1807
02:13:02,400 --> 02:13:04,400
A frenzied flame.

1808
02:13:08,400 --> 02:13:10,400
We're hugging the wall.

1809
02:13:10,400 --> 02:13:12,400
Do you stop him?

1810
02:13:16,400 --> 02:13:18,400
Yeah, fucking knock off.

1811
02:13:20,400 --> 02:13:22,400
Yeah, get him, get him, get him!

1812
02:13:22,400 --> 02:13:24,400
Gang violence!

1813
02:13:24,400 --> 02:13:26,400
Okay, let me cover my stamina.

1814
02:13:30,400 --> 02:13:32,400
Is that a summoning thing down there?

1815
02:13:32,400 --> 02:13:34,400
Ah!

1816
02:13:34,400 --> 02:13:36,400
Wifling!

1817
02:13:36,400 --> 02:13:38,400
No wiki, just pure knowledge and skill.

1818
02:13:38,400 --> 02:13:40,400
Is there an enemy wifling here?

1819
02:13:42,400 --> 02:13:44,400
Uh, this gray site is called

1820
02:13:44,400 --> 02:13:46,400
Dragon Temple rooftop

1821
02:13:46,400 --> 02:13:48,400
if there's an enemy who wants to come in.

1822
02:13:48,400 --> 02:13:50,400
Oh, Madame Missouri!

1823
02:13:52,400 --> 02:13:54,400
Mm, mm, mm, mm, mm, mm, mm.

1824
02:13:54,400 --> 02:13:56,400
Chat's wisdom just

1825
02:13:56,400 --> 02:13:58,400
is really spectacular.

1826
02:14:00,400 --> 02:14:02,400
There's no enemy wiflings, I can't believe it.

1827
02:14:02,400 --> 02:14:04,400
Careful of lightning, I have.

1828
02:14:04,400 --> 02:14:06,400
Is it too dangerous?

1829
02:14:06,400 --> 02:14:08,400
Oh, ding!

1830
02:14:10,400 --> 02:14:12,400
What am I even having?

1831
02:14:12,400 --> 02:14:14,400
I'm supposed to say your name, what even was that?

1832
02:14:14,400 --> 02:14:16,400
And you come.

1833
02:14:16,400 --> 02:14:18,400
There, you get a new nickname.

1834
02:14:18,400 --> 02:14:20,400
Aina Onoho, there you go, all yours.

1835
02:14:26,400 --> 02:14:28,400
That's the main character from Overload?

1836
02:14:28,400 --> 02:14:30,400
Oh my god, I'm sorry.

1837
02:14:32,400 --> 02:14:34,400
I'm sorry.

1838
02:14:34,400 --> 02:14:36,400
Okay, take us.

1839
02:14:36,400 --> 02:14:38,400
Show me the way.

1840
02:14:38,400 --> 02:14:40,400
Show me the way to victory, to victory, to victory.

1841
02:14:40,400 --> 02:14:42,400
Show me the way to victory, all along the way.

1842
02:14:46,400 --> 02:14:48,400
I think there's a fight ahead.

1843
02:14:48,400 --> 02:14:50,400
Oh.

1844
02:14:50,400 --> 02:14:52,400
Mm.

1845
02:14:56,400 --> 02:14:58,400
Mm.

1846
02:14:58,400 --> 02:15:00,400
Oh, is this this run sprint section?

1847
02:15:00,400 --> 02:15:02,400
I think we have to just keep running.

1848
02:15:02,400 --> 02:15:06,400
Like, literally ignore the birds and keep running.

1849
02:15:06,400 --> 02:15:08,400
Yeah.

1850
02:15:08,400 --> 02:15:10,400
Yeah.

1851
02:15:10,400 --> 02:15:12,400
Yep, I'm getting a memory.

1852
02:15:12,400 --> 02:15:14,400
And then this dragon's a fake dragon.

1853
02:15:14,400 --> 02:15:16,400
He doesn't actually want to fight us.

1854
02:15:16,400 --> 02:15:18,400
He flies away at a later date.

1855
02:15:18,400 --> 02:15:20,400
Oh.

1856
02:15:22,400 --> 02:15:24,400
He's a fake dragon.

1857
02:15:28,400 --> 02:15:30,400
Let me guess.

1858
02:15:30,400 --> 02:15:32,400
They can't get hurt by environmental things like that.

1859
02:15:32,400 --> 02:15:34,400
But I can.

1860
02:15:34,400 --> 02:15:36,400
Fake dragon, he's gone.

1861
02:15:40,400 --> 02:15:42,400
Falcons aren't fake anyway.

1862
02:15:42,400 --> 02:15:44,400
They're coming for blood.

1863
02:15:44,400 --> 02:15:46,400
I can't.

1864
02:15:46,400 --> 02:15:48,400
There we go.

1865
02:15:48,400 --> 02:15:50,400
Oh, nice heal, nice heal.

1866
02:15:50,400 --> 02:15:52,400
Oh, they seem to be stuck over there.

1867
02:15:52,400 --> 02:15:54,400
Mm.

1868
02:16:00,400 --> 02:16:02,400
I've never seen a single try finger,

1869
02:16:02,400 --> 02:16:04,400
but I don't really read the messages

1870
02:16:04,400 --> 02:16:06,400
because the last time I read them,

1871
02:16:06,400 --> 02:16:08,400
it goes Fortnite and I'm like,

1872
02:16:08,400 --> 02:16:10,400
I just got Fortnated.

1873
02:16:10,400 --> 02:16:12,400
Fortnite's panel pen.

1874
02:16:14,400 --> 02:16:16,400
Wait a minute.

1875
02:16:16,400 --> 02:16:18,400
Did I ever get an update about the music video

1876
02:16:18,400 --> 02:16:20,400
for Amy's thing yet?

1877
02:16:22,400 --> 02:16:24,400
Hold on, hold on.

1878
02:16:24,400 --> 02:16:26,400
Let me just fucking message management.

1879
02:16:28,400 --> 02:16:30,400
Amy's Fortnite battle pass

1880
02:16:30,400 --> 02:16:32,400
should have came out ages ago.

1881
02:16:32,400 --> 02:16:34,400
Uh, Amy's Fortnite

1882
02:16:34,400 --> 02:16:36,400
battle pass

1883
02:16:36,400 --> 02:16:38,400
music video

1884
02:16:38,400 --> 02:16:40,400
question mark.

1885
02:16:42,400 --> 02:16:44,400
Sorry.

1886
02:16:44,400 --> 02:16:46,400
It's hard being a mother and a mummy

1887
02:16:46,400 --> 02:16:48,400
at the same time, you know?

1888
02:16:58,400 --> 02:17:00,400
I don't even know

1889
02:17:00,400 --> 02:17:02,400
how I did that.

1890
02:17:08,400 --> 02:17:10,400
Am I just go for it and then I'll pick you up

1891
02:17:10,400 --> 02:17:12,400
on the other side?

1892
02:17:14,400 --> 02:17:16,400
Ah, I'm awfully mailing.

1893
02:17:16,400 --> 02:17:18,400
Right, you killed the dragon.

1894
02:17:18,400 --> 02:17:20,400
Oh, you made the dragons back!

1895
02:17:22,400 --> 02:17:24,400
The dragon doesn't remember

1896
02:17:24,400 --> 02:17:26,400
being taken away.

1897
02:17:28,400 --> 02:17:30,400
Reflings take this dragon's balls.

1898
02:17:34,400 --> 02:17:36,400
Mm.

1899
02:17:36,400 --> 02:17:38,400
Mm.

1900
02:17:40,400 --> 02:17:42,400
Ow, my back.

1901
02:17:44,400 --> 02:17:46,400
My neck and my crack.

1902
02:17:48,400 --> 02:17:50,400
No, it didn't become an, where's Taurin?

1903
02:17:50,400 --> 02:17:52,400
Taurin?

1904
02:17:56,400 --> 02:17:58,400
Is Taurin too scared to be spawned here?

1905
02:17:58,400 --> 02:18:00,400
Because honestly, same.

1906
02:18:00,400 --> 02:18:02,400
My owner was like,

1907
02:18:02,400 --> 02:18:04,400
get it up, come on, I want to go.

1908
02:18:04,400 --> 02:18:06,400
Oh, I can keep my souls.

1909
02:18:08,400 --> 02:18:10,400
I was rather kind of the game.

1910
02:18:12,400 --> 02:18:14,400
How are you aggro to me already?

1911
02:18:14,400 --> 02:18:16,400
Whoa.

1912
02:18:16,400 --> 02:18:18,400
Leave me alone!

1913
02:18:18,400 --> 02:18:20,400
No!

1914
02:18:20,400 --> 02:18:22,400
No, leave me alone, I refuse.

1915
02:18:22,400 --> 02:18:24,400
Oh, it's our boss!

1916
02:18:24,400 --> 02:18:26,400
Oh my god, I need my refunds now.

1917
02:18:26,400 --> 02:18:28,400
Okay, hold on, hold on.

1918
02:18:28,400 --> 02:18:30,400
Let me stop fucking up, hold on.

1919
02:18:30,400 --> 02:18:32,400
Let me get my thing back.

1920
02:18:32,400 --> 02:18:34,400
Oh fuck it, no, I'm going in, sorry.

1921
02:18:34,400 --> 02:18:36,400
Sorry, there's too many, I'm scared.

1922
02:18:36,400 --> 02:18:38,400
Master Scott, oh, this isn't a boss!

1923
02:18:38,400 --> 02:18:40,400
Oh!

1924
02:18:40,400 --> 02:18:42,400
Everything's getting worse!

1925
02:18:42,400 --> 02:18:44,400
Everything's getting worse without you, Refling.

1926
02:18:46,400 --> 02:18:48,400
Why aren't you, oh, go up the lift!

1927
02:18:48,400 --> 02:18:50,400
Please just go up the lift.

1928
02:18:50,400 --> 02:18:52,400
Please, oh, safety, okay.

1929
02:18:54,400 --> 02:18:56,400
Okay, this is better.

1930
02:18:56,400 --> 02:18:58,400
There's a new area in the enemies.

1931
02:18:58,400 --> 02:19:00,400
Oh, thank you.

1932
02:19:00,400 --> 02:19:02,400
Oh my god.

1933
02:19:04,400 --> 02:19:06,400
Don't, don't do that to me again.

1934
02:19:06,400 --> 02:19:08,400
Do you understand?

1935
02:19:08,400 --> 02:19:10,400
Say yes, Mummy.

1936
02:19:10,400 --> 02:19:12,400
Yes, Mummy, I love you again.

1937
02:19:12,400 --> 02:19:14,400
Thank you, good to see you.

1938
02:19:14,400 --> 02:19:16,400
And good boy, you deserve all the treaties to me.

1939
02:19:16,400 --> 02:19:18,400
And all the take away you deserve.

1940
02:19:18,400 --> 02:19:20,400
For no particular reason.

1941
02:19:22,400 --> 02:19:24,400
Major reason?

1942
02:19:24,400 --> 02:19:26,400
I think there's a few Reflings that haven't had a chance to play with me yet.

1943
02:19:26,400 --> 02:19:28,400
I'm not sure.

1944
02:19:28,400 --> 02:19:30,400
Come, come on, what are you doing?

1945
02:19:30,400 --> 02:19:32,400
Yeah, you've not been a good Refling.

1946
02:19:34,400 --> 02:19:36,400
Unable to summit, god.

1947
02:19:36,400 --> 02:19:38,400
I don't know what.

1948
02:19:38,400 --> 02:19:40,400
Carpet bomb, you're a naughty Refling.

1949
02:19:42,400 --> 02:19:44,400
You're a naked Refling, that's what you are.

1950
02:19:50,400 --> 02:19:52,400
You're original, aren't you?

1951
02:19:52,400 --> 02:19:54,400
I'm gonna try

1952
02:19:54,400 --> 02:19:56,400
and get chicken pie

1953
02:19:56,400 --> 02:19:58,400
since I'm going to get my nails done.

1954
02:20:02,400 --> 02:20:04,400
No dragon? Wait, am I supposed to do a dragon?

1955
02:20:08,400 --> 02:20:10,400
I recommend doing

1956
02:20:10,400 --> 02:20:12,400
dragon first so we can show you the way down.

1957
02:20:14,400 --> 02:20:16,400
Just go back to the dragon.

1958
02:20:16,400 --> 02:20:18,400
Are we going back?

1959
02:20:18,400 --> 02:20:20,400
Oh, I did not expect that, I'm gonna be honest.

1960
02:20:22,400 --> 02:20:24,400
You broke my game!

1961
02:20:26,400 --> 02:20:28,400
Stop breaking my game!

1962
02:20:30,400 --> 02:20:32,400
Stop it, right, let's try again.

1963
02:20:34,400 --> 02:20:36,400
Stop breaking my game!

1964
02:20:38,400 --> 02:20:40,400
You crashed again.

1965
02:20:40,400 --> 02:20:42,400
I've never crashed.

1966
02:20:42,400 --> 02:20:44,400
I don't know why it's having such a team.

1967
02:20:44,400 --> 02:20:46,400
It's having like a

1968
02:20:46,400 --> 02:20:48,400
such a rough team.

1969
02:20:56,400 --> 02:20:58,400
It's having such a hard time processing.

1970
02:20:58,400 --> 02:21:00,400
I don't know what's going on.

1971
02:21:02,400 --> 02:21:04,400
Jarhead jumpscares the game engine.

1972
02:21:06,400 --> 02:21:08,400
We broke the bed.

1973
02:21:16,400 --> 02:21:18,400
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I know there's less

1974
02:21:18,400 --> 02:21:20,400
freaking loss or progress.

1975
02:21:20,400 --> 02:21:22,400
We're just having a stroke, right. Hydration check, hydration check.

1976
02:21:26,400 --> 02:21:28,400
So I need to go back, kill the dragon,

1977
02:21:28,400 --> 02:21:30,400
and then we finish the game?

1978
02:21:36,400 --> 02:21:38,400
So what?

1979
02:21:38,400 --> 02:21:40,400
A colleague is in here at the

1980
02:21:40,400 --> 02:21:42,400
at the Great Bridge, and then we go back

1981
02:21:42,400 --> 02:21:44,400
down.

1982
02:21:48,400 --> 02:21:50,400
I am just

1983
02:21:50,400 --> 02:21:52,400
spin to window, I'll mark off

1984
02:21:52,400 --> 02:21:54,400
everyone's name.

1985
02:21:54,400 --> 02:21:56,400
Oh.

1986
02:21:56,400 --> 02:21:58,400
Spin to win.

1987
02:22:00,400 --> 02:22:02,400
You just had a thought.

1988
02:22:02,400 --> 02:22:04,400
My ex, you carried me a little bit.

1989
02:22:04,400 --> 02:22:06,400
No, I'm even not had a chance to do.

1990
02:22:12,400 --> 02:22:14,400
Is it you that keeps breaking my game?

1991
02:22:14,400 --> 02:22:16,400
I

1992
02:22:22,400 --> 02:22:24,400
I said you that keeps breaking my game

1993
02:22:24,400 --> 02:22:26,400
unironically.

1994
02:22:26,400 --> 02:22:28,400
I'm scared to call you in.

1995
02:22:36,400 --> 02:22:38,400
Maybe it's I'm right

1996
02:22:38,400 --> 02:22:40,400
if my game breaks after this.

1997
02:22:40,400 --> 02:22:42,400
You need to start

1998
02:22:42,400 --> 02:22:44,400
like, I don't know.

1999
02:22:44,400 --> 02:22:46,400
It should be fine.

2000
02:22:46,400 --> 02:22:48,400
Yeah, bye.

2001
02:22:54,400 --> 02:22:56,400
If my game crashes,

2002
02:22:56,400 --> 02:22:58,400
I know it's you.

2003
02:22:58,400 --> 02:23:00,400
And I can't believe it.

2004
02:23:00,400 --> 02:23:02,400
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

2005
02:23:02,400 --> 02:23:04,400
Other reason not here yet.

2006
02:23:10,400 --> 02:23:12,400
You're beautiful.

2007
02:23:12,400 --> 02:23:14,400
You're beautiful.

2008
02:23:14,400 --> 02:23:16,400
Apologies.

2009
02:23:16,400 --> 02:23:18,400
You're beautiful.

2010
02:23:18,400 --> 02:23:20,400
You're beautiful.

2011
02:23:20,400 --> 02:23:22,400
Ready?

2012
02:23:22,400 --> 02:23:24,400
The wagon plane.

2013
02:23:24,400 --> 02:23:26,400
Are you Neo?

2014
02:23:26,400 --> 02:23:28,400
Literally, damn right you fucking Neo.

2015
02:23:28,400 --> 02:23:30,400
I swear God, if you fucking break this

2016
02:23:30,400 --> 02:23:32,400
PC again.

2017
02:23:32,400 --> 02:23:34,400
I'm going to get you bad.

2018
02:23:34,400 --> 02:23:36,400
I'm going to get you bad if this

2019
02:23:36,400 --> 02:23:38,400
freaking PC, this game shuts down one

2020
02:23:38,400 --> 02:23:40,400
time.

2021
02:23:48,400 --> 02:23:50,400
Whoa.

2022
02:23:50,400 --> 02:23:52,400
Who's doing that?

2023
02:23:52,400 --> 02:23:54,400
That's no me.

2024
02:23:56,400 --> 02:23:58,400
Is that light and friendly or dangerous?

2025
02:24:00,400 --> 02:24:02,400
More balls for my collection.

2026
02:24:08,400 --> 02:24:10,400
Get her frustrated

2027
02:24:10,400 --> 02:24:12,400
so she greets.

2028
02:24:16,400 --> 02:24:18,400
What's wrong with that?

2029
02:24:18,400 --> 02:24:20,400
This is

2030
02:24:20,400 --> 02:24:22,400
fucker.

2031
02:24:22,400 --> 02:24:24,400
Oh wait, this isn't going to work.

2032
02:24:24,400 --> 02:24:26,400
I have to go in on my own?

2033
02:24:26,400 --> 02:24:28,400
No.

2034
02:24:28,400 --> 02:24:30,400
You guys are going to have to de-spawn.

2035
02:24:30,400 --> 02:24:32,400
I have to go in on my own?

2036
02:24:32,400 --> 02:24:34,400
Are you from here?

2037
02:24:34,400 --> 02:24:36,400
Do I have to do the dragon fight

2038
02:24:36,400 --> 02:24:38,400
on my own?

2039
02:24:38,400 --> 02:24:40,400
Don't say lock in.

2040
02:24:42,400 --> 02:24:44,400
What are you posing for?

2041
02:24:44,400 --> 02:24:46,400
Get out of here.

2042
02:24:46,400 --> 02:24:48,400
Okay, well, I'll mark off

2043
02:24:48,400 --> 02:24:50,400
no one's name count at that time.

2044
02:24:50,400 --> 02:24:52,400
You took me like two centimeters across the map.

2045
02:24:52,400 --> 02:24:54,400
Ugh.

2046
02:24:54,400 --> 02:24:56,400
I should be able to summon

2047
02:24:56,400 --> 02:24:58,400
for the fight.

2048
02:24:58,400 --> 02:25:00,400
Oh yeah, I've vanquished

2049
02:25:00,400 --> 02:25:02,400
so hard.

2050
02:25:02,400 --> 02:25:04,400
I've vanquished so hard.

2051
02:25:04,400 --> 02:25:06,400
You're beyond the bounty.

2052
02:25:06,400 --> 02:25:08,400
The boundaries of the multiplayer.

2053
02:25:08,400 --> 02:25:10,400
Oh, you're like right down there.

2054
02:25:10,400 --> 02:25:12,400
How?

2055
02:25:12,400 --> 02:25:14,400
What?

2056
02:25:14,400 --> 02:25:16,400
This game is such a-

2057
02:25:16,400 --> 02:25:18,400
How do you snipe so well?

2058
02:25:18,400 --> 02:25:20,400
How do you snipe so well?

2059
02:25:20,400 --> 02:25:22,400
You snipe too well.

2060
02:25:22,400 --> 02:25:24,400
You need to give the other refunds

2061
02:25:24,400 --> 02:25:26,400
I haven't had the chance to.

2062
02:25:26,400 --> 02:25:28,400
I swear if that's you down there.

2063
02:25:28,400 --> 02:25:30,400
I don't know how you are sniping this well.

2064
02:25:30,400 --> 02:25:32,400
I'm literally walking into it.

2065
02:25:32,400 --> 02:25:34,400
I swear.

2066
02:25:36,400 --> 02:25:38,400
Okay, dragon bench.

2067
02:25:38,400 --> 02:25:40,400
You can come in.

2068
02:25:46,400 --> 02:25:48,400
I did that thing just as a proof

2069
02:25:48,400 --> 02:25:50,400
of concept.

2070
02:25:50,400 --> 02:25:52,400
They approved it, I guess.

2071
02:25:52,400 --> 02:25:54,400
If there's anyone else that wants to be here.

2072
02:25:58,400 --> 02:26:00,400
Sir Rush?

2073
02:26:00,400 --> 02:26:02,400
You lagged out or something happened?

2074
02:26:02,400 --> 02:26:04,400
Is your name smart enough for it to be?

2075
02:26:08,400 --> 02:26:10,400
I won't do an evil refland

2076
02:26:10,400 --> 02:26:12,400
because if we're about to do a boss fight

2077
02:26:12,400 --> 02:26:14,400
you get despawned anyway.

2078
02:26:16,400 --> 02:26:18,400
They're-

2079
02:26:18,400 --> 02:26:20,400
They're playing the level along with you

2080
02:26:20,400 --> 02:26:22,400
and single for a keyboard.

2081
02:26:22,400 --> 02:26:24,400
Do I need to use the needle

2082
02:26:24,400 --> 02:26:26,400
before I kill him?

2083
02:26:30,400 --> 02:26:32,400
Do I?

2084
02:26:32,400 --> 02:26:34,400
After?

2085
02:26:34,400 --> 02:26:36,400
After?

2086
02:26:36,400 --> 02:26:38,400
Okay, after. Got it.

2087
02:26:38,400 --> 02:26:40,400
Where'd I go now?

2088
02:26:40,400 --> 02:26:42,400
Show me, show me, show me, before we get invaded

2089
02:26:42,400 --> 02:26:44,400
on this little rock.

2090
02:26:46,400 --> 02:26:48,400
I'm falling.

2091
02:26:48,400 --> 02:26:50,400
I'm trying to get like you, my boy.

2092
02:26:54,400 --> 02:26:56,400
Surely I won't fall off the map.

2093
02:26:56,400 --> 02:26:58,400
Surely.

2094
02:27:00,400 --> 02:27:02,400
Is this the thing where it like

2095
02:27:02,400 --> 02:27:04,400
sucks you into it and I have to interact

2096
02:27:04,400 --> 02:27:06,400
with something to get sucked in?

2097
02:27:06,400 --> 02:27:08,400
Lie down?

2098
02:27:08,400 --> 02:27:10,400
Sure. Why not?

2099
02:27:10,400 --> 02:27:12,400
I don't see why not. Me and the boys

2100
02:27:12,400 --> 02:27:14,400
just lying down.

2101
02:27:16,400 --> 02:27:18,400
What bizarre transitions

2102
02:27:18,400 --> 02:27:20,400
into like fights

2103
02:27:20,400 --> 02:27:22,400
and stuff?

2104
02:27:22,400 --> 02:27:24,400
Is it literally like it sucked into the vortex?

2105
02:27:30,400 --> 02:27:32,400
I don't remember much of this at all.

2106
02:27:34,400 --> 02:27:36,400
We're going back in time.

2107
02:27:42,400 --> 02:27:44,400
I'm going to the past when like

2108
02:27:44,400 --> 02:27:46,400
it wasn't a vortex.

2109
02:27:54,400 --> 02:27:56,400
That's rather blinding.

2110
02:27:56,400 --> 02:27:58,400
As if it's not first thing in the morning.

2111
02:28:08,400 --> 02:28:10,400
Futurelings, are you here too?

2112
02:28:10,400 --> 02:28:12,400
Oh no, pastlings, are you here?

2113
02:28:14,400 --> 02:28:16,400
There's a big old arena.

2114
02:28:20,400 --> 02:28:22,400
Oh, I'm going into the past to fight the first Elden Lord.

2115
02:28:22,400 --> 02:28:24,400
That's cool concept.

2116
02:28:24,400 --> 02:28:26,400
I like that prehistorical reason.

2117
02:28:28,400 --> 02:28:30,400
Unscramble your

2118
02:28:30,400 --> 02:28:32,400
Farum Azula.

2119
02:28:40,400 --> 02:28:42,400
He's got two heads?

2120
02:28:42,400 --> 02:28:44,400
Do you have two? Oh, you do.

2121
02:28:44,400 --> 02:28:46,400
Okay.

2122
02:28:50,400 --> 02:28:52,400
Leechlings?

2123
02:28:52,400 --> 02:28:54,400
Honestly, we run around.

2124
02:28:54,400 --> 02:28:56,400
Dustling.

2125
02:29:02,400 --> 02:29:04,400
That's not the same song

2126
02:29:04,400 --> 02:29:06,400
that we were singing at all.

2127
02:29:06,400 --> 02:29:08,400
Time for precious item.

2128
02:29:10,400 --> 02:29:12,400
You go first.

2129
02:29:12,400 --> 02:29:14,400
Let me push you forward.

2130
02:29:18,400 --> 02:29:20,400
Is there a cutscene?

2131
02:29:20,400 --> 02:29:22,400
Or do we just start swinging?

2132
02:29:24,400 --> 02:29:26,400
We just start swinging. There's no cutscene.

2133
02:29:28,400 --> 02:29:30,400
Oh my god.

2134
02:29:30,400 --> 02:29:32,400
Oh my god, I'm hiding behind this pillar.

2135
02:29:32,400 --> 02:29:34,400
You guys keep going.

2136
02:29:34,400 --> 02:29:36,400
Go on without me.

2137
02:29:36,400 --> 02:29:38,400
Did one?

2138
02:29:42,400 --> 02:29:44,400
Did I go up to him and hit him?

2139
02:29:44,400 --> 02:29:46,400
I'm a bit scared.

2140
02:29:50,400 --> 02:29:52,400
Am I?

2141
02:29:52,400 --> 02:29:54,400
Okay.

2142
02:29:54,400 --> 02:29:56,400
I'm helping, I'm helping.

2143
02:29:58,400 --> 02:30:00,400
Okay, I'm out of hydration.

2144
02:30:00,400 --> 02:30:02,400
Whoa, whoa.

2145
02:30:02,400 --> 02:30:04,400
Um...

2146
02:30:12,400 --> 02:30:14,400
Can I just support from the sidelines?

2147
02:30:14,400 --> 02:30:16,400
I don't do this.

2148
02:30:20,400 --> 02:30:22,400
I mean, you're killing him.

2149
02:30:26,400 --> 02:30:28,400
His freaking breath is...

2150
02:30:28,400 --> 02:30:30,400
really dangerous, though.

2151
02:30:32,400 --> 02:30:34,400
Is there implied a third head

2152
02:30:34,400 --> 02:30:36,400
that got cut off or something?

2153
02:30:40,400 --> 02:30:42,400
What does that mean?

2154
02:30:42,400 --> 02:30:44,400
I'm too scared to be near him.

2155
02:30:44,400 --> 02:30:46,400
Yeah, that's why.

2156
02:30:46,400 --> 02:30:48,400
I didn't even...

2157
02:30:48,400 --> 02:30:50,400
I didn't even have time to react to the lightning move.

2158
02:30:52,400 --> 02:30:54,400
Whoa.

2159
02:30:54,400 --> 02:30:56,400
What did you do?

2160
02:30:56,400 --> 02:30:58,400
I heard him.

2161
02:30:58,400 --> 02:31:00,400
I see him.

2162
02:31:02,400 --> 02:31:04,400
Okay.

2163
02:31:04,400 --> 02:31:06,400
They really like the enemies

2164
02:31:06,400 --> 02:31:08,400
that come flying in.

2165
02:31:08,400 --> 02:31:10,400
They're like, yeah, we love them.

2166
02:31:10,400 --> 02:31:12,400
We'll go first tail.

2167
02:31:18,400 --> 02:31:20,400
Bael took three of his heads.

2168
02:31:20,400 --> 02:31:22,400
Oh, he used to be bigger.

2169
02:31:22,400 --> 02:31:24,400
I was going to say that looks

2170
02:31:24,400 --> 02:31:26,400
like where a third one should be.

2171
02:31:28,400 --> 02:31:30,400
A little spank here and there.

2172
02:31:30,400 --> 02:31:32,400
Okay, let me back up.

2173
02:31:32,400 --> 02:31:34,400
I need to play this super safe.

2174
02:31:36,400 --> 02:31:38,400
Hey, y'all.

2175
02:31:38,400 --> 02:31:40,400
There, nice.

2176
02:31:40,400 --> 02:31:42,400
Oh, you poisoned him.

2177
02:31:46,400 --> 02:31:48,400
You are...

2178
02:31:48,400 --> 02:31:50,400
Don't worry, I got his tail.

2179
02:31:50,400 --> 02:31:52,400
You guys just keep doing the good thing

2180
02:31:52,400 --> 02:31:54,400
or whatever it is you're doing.

2181
02:31:54,400 --> 02:31:56,400
Just keep it up.

2182
02:31:56,400 --> 02:31:58,400
Ow.

2183
02:31:58,400 --> 02:32:00,400
I can't refling down.

2184
02:32:00,400 --> 02:32:02,400
No.

2185
02:32:02,400 --> 02:32:04,400
Refling.

2186
02:32:04,400 --> 02:32:06,400
No, what happened?

2187
02:32:06,400 --> 02:32:08,400
Well,

2188
02:32:08,400 --> 02:32:10,400
this is dangerous.

2189
02:32:10,400 --> 02:32:12,400
This is very dangerous.

2190
02:32:14,400 --> 02:32:16,400
Because I'm...

2191
02:32:16,400 --> 02:32:18,400
Oh, no.

2192
02:32:18,400 --> 02:32:20,400
This is dangerous.

2193
02:32:20,400 --> 02:32:22,400
What happened?

2194
02:32:22,400 --> 02:32:24,400
I can't even get there.

2195
02:32:24,400 --> 02:32:26,400
I can't even get up to him.

2196
02:32:28,400 --> 02:32:30,400
Oh.

2197
02:32:32,400 --> 02:32:34,400
Okay, maybe the old lock

2198
02:32:34,400 --> 02:32:36,400
like thing does have its benefits.

2199
02:32:40,400 --> 02:32:42,400
Where is he?

2200
02:32:44,400 --> 02:32:46,400
I have no idea where he is.

2201
02:32:48,400 --> 02:32:50,400
I'm just happy to be here.

2202
02:32:54,400 --> 02:32:56,400
He's got laser beams.

2203
02:32:58,400 --> 02:33:00,400
Oh.

2204
02:33:04,400 --> 02:33:06,400
That thing almost one shot me.

2205
02:33:06,400 --> 02:33:08,400
Oh, my God.

2206
02:33:08,400 --> 02:33:10,400
Living up to the name Dragonbish,

2207
02:33:10,400 --> 02:33:12,400
but God, damn.

2208
02:33:12,400 --> 02:33:14,400
What?

2209
02:33:14,400 --> 02:33:16,400
That laser beam almost got me.

2210
02:33:20,400 --> 02:33:22,400
Jeez.

2211
02:33:22,400 --> 02:33:24,400
What do we do now?

2212
02:33:24,400 --> 02:33:26,400
First try. Yeah, it was totally me.

2213
02:33:26,400 --> 02:33:28,400
I did so much damage.

2214
02:33:32,400 --> 02:33:34,400
Get to the grace and use the needle at the grace.

2215
02:33:34,400 --> 02:33:36,400
Okay.

2216
02:33:36,400 --> 02:33:38,400
Hello, Mr. Grace site. How's your weight against?

2217
02:33:40,400 --> 02:33:42,400
There's not too many.

2218
02:33:42,400 --> 02:33:44,400
Rest at the grace site.

2219
02:33:44,400 --> 02:33:46,400
Oh, I can't use it.

2220
02:33:46,400 --> 02:33:48,400
Then I'll do it here.

2221
02:33:56,400 --> 02:33:58,400
Oh, using the inventory.

2222
02:33:58,400 --> 02:34:00,400
Sorry. Sorry. Sorry.

2223
02:34:00,400 --> 02:34:02,400
I knew that.

2224
02:34:02,400 --> 02:34:04,400
Are you?

2225
02:34:04,400 --> 02:34:06,400
Micaela's needle?

2226
02:34:06,400 --> 02:34:08,400
Subdues are once accepted frenzied flame.

2227
02:34:10,400 --> 02:34:12,400
This one?

2228
02:34:12,400 --> 02:34:14,400
It's this one, isn't it?

2229
02:34:14,400 --> 02:34:16,400
Yeah.

2230
02:34:16,400 --> 02:34:18,400
Yeah, this one.

2231
02:34:18,400 --> 02:34:20,400
Yeah, okay.

2232
02:34:20,400 --> 02:34:22,400
Okay, I'll just make it shit.

2233
02:34:22,400 --> 02:34:24,400
Thank you, darling.

2234
02:34:24,400 --> 02:34:26,400
Use

2235
02:34:26,400 --> 02:34:28,400
to tame this flame of frenzied.

2236
02:34:30,400 --> 02:34:32,400
Did I just

2237
02:34:32,400 --> 02:34:34,400
stop myself in the eye with that?

2238
02:34:36,400 --> 02:34:38,400
Okay, where did I go now?

2239
02:34:40,400 --> 02:34:42,400
And you could burn the entire world.

2240
02:34:42,400 --> 02:34:44,400
No, I want my maiden alive.

2241
02:34:44,400 --> 02:34:46,400
I know you're cured. Travel back

2242
02:34:46,400 --> 02:34:48,400
to say the great bridge.

2243
02:34:48,400 --> 02:34:50,400
The great bridge.

2244
02:34:50,400 --> 02:34:52,400
Do I use a pill?

2245
02:34:54,400 --> 02:34:56,400
Funnily enough, killing the dragon was not needed

2246
02:34:56,400 --> 02:34:58,400
to do the flame.

2247
02:34:58,400 --> 02:35:00,400
Did you guys just want to do the dragon fate?

2248
02:35:00,400 --> 02:35:02,400
Be honest.

2249
02:35:02,400 --> 02:35:04,400
Did you just want to do the dragon fate?

2250
02:35:04,400 --> 02:35:06,400
Okay, spin your names marked out,

2251
02:35:06,400 --> 02:35:08,400
because I think something happened.

2252
02:35:08,400 --> 02:35:10,400
Just in action.

2253
02:35:10,400 --> 02:35:12,400
Is it you?

2254
02:35:12,400 --> 02:35:14,400
Dizzy, you two, you never got him.

2255
02:35:16,400 --> 02:35:18,400
Spinning to ween.

2256
02:35:18,400 --> 02:35:20,400
Dizzy.

2257
02:35:20,400 --> 02:35:22,400
Follow the bridge and kill the horse knight.

2258
02:35:22,400 --> 02:35:24,400
Say no more.

2259
02:35:24,400 --> 02:35:26,400
If you break my PC,

2260
02:35:26,400 --> 02:35:28,400
ass with.

2261
02:35:28,400 --> 02:35:30,400
To everything you hold deep.

2262
02:35:32,400 --> 02:35:34,400
Insert the purple clip where she's like

2263
02:35:34,400 --> 02:35:36,400
I want to shoot up him.

2264
02:35:42,400 --> 02:35:44,400
You get that pure strength.

2265
02:35:44,400 --> 02:35:46,400
I'm gonna look at you. I'm so royal.

2266
02:35:46,400 --> 02:35:48,400
Okay, there we go.

2267
02:35:48,400 --> 02:35:50,400
You can use it, then die and not have to fight.

2268
02:35:50,400 --> 02:35:52,400
Pretty sure you have to be in the arena

2269
02:35:52,400 --> 02:35:54,400
for at least a third to one.

2270
02:35:54,400 --> 02:35:56,400
I thought it was required.

2271
02:35:58,400 --> 02:36:00,400
Okay, a fight.

2272
02:36:00,400 --> 02:36:02,400
Is this the bowling ball place?

2273
02:36:04,400 --> 02:36:06,400
No, this is just a knight.

2274
02:36:06,400 --> 02:36:08,400
Crystal ball, a person, a thingy-mobobber.

2275
02:36:10,400 --> 02:36:12,400
Come, we will attack at once.

2276
02:36:14,400 --> 02:36:16,400
We will take our golden runes and be gone.

2277
02:36:16,400 --> 02:36:18,400
We will deal devastating blows.

2278
02:36:24,400 --> 02:36:26,400
Oh my gosh.

2279
02:36:30,400 --> 02:36:32,400
Oh my gosh.

2280
02:36:36,400 --> 02:36:38,400
Can I just have yous all the time?

2281
02:36:42,400 --> 02:36:44,400
So you don't despawn?

2282
02:36:44,400 --> 02:36:46,400
This then, I forgot.

2283
02:36:46,400 --> 02:36:48,400
I don't know what fight this is.

2284
02:36:56,400 --> 02:36:58,400
Is this someone where he turns red?

2285
02:37:00,400 --> 02:37:02,400
In phase two?

2286
02:37:10,400 --> 02:37:12,400
I truly have forgotten what an air this one is.

2287
02:37:14,400 --> 02:37:16,400
He looks like the guy that you feed the death routes to...

2288
02:37:20,400 --> 02:37:22,400
Oh, I missed.

2289
02:37:22,400 --> 02:37:24,400
I missed again, sorry.

2290
02:37:24,400 --> 02:37:26,400
How are you keeping up with his speed?

2291
02:37:26,400 --> 02:37:28,400
I can't even make it to him.

2292
02:37:30,400 --> 02:37:32,400
It's him, oh.

2293
02:37:32,400 --> 02:37:34,400
Oh wait, that's the death route guy we feed?

2294
02:37:36,400 --> 02:37:38,400
I feel really bad.

2295
02:37:40,400 --> 02:37:42,400
Is he still in Caleb after we finish this?

2296
02:37:44,400 --> 02:37:46,400
Is it kind of just one of those game things?

2297
02:37:54,400 --> 02:37:56,400
We got to put him down.

2298
02:37:56,400 --> 02:37:58,400
Oh dear.

2299
02:38:04,400 --> 02:38:06,400
Oh yeah, he's the red guy all right.

2300
02:38:06,400 --> 02:38:08,400
You guys know how to kill that, right?

2301
02:38:18,400 --> 02:38:20,400
He wants death route to get the part of death and death he lost to Rani.

2302
02:38:20,400 --> 02:38:22,400
Yeah, like Rani did it to him.

2303
02:38:26,400 --> 02:38:28,400
If you give him all of the death route,

2304
02:38:28,400 --> 02:38:30,400
he gets sad that he needs to fight you.

2305
02:38:30,400 --> 02:38:32,400
Oh really, there's hidden guys?

2306
02:38:32,400 --> 02:38:34,400
I wonder what he says.

2307
02:38:34,400 --> 02:38:36,400
I'm feeling a little modeling.

2308
02:38:40,400 --> 02:38:42,400
Send him to the farm upstate at once.

2309
02:38:42,400 --> 02:38:44,400
Oh.

2310
02:38:48,400 --> 02:38:50,400
May I please think?

2311
02:38:50,400 --> 02:38:52,400
Death and death?

2312
02:38:52,400 --> 02:38:54,400
May I please think for a moment?

2313
02:38:56,400 --> 02:38:58,400
Okay, I missed.

2314
02:38:58,400 --> 02:39:00,400
And I'm out of stamina, hold on. Let me recover my stamina.

2315
02:39:00,400 --> 02:39:02,400
How am I doing this?

2316
02:39:02,400 --> 02:39:04,400
How does he...

2317
02:39:06,400 --> 02:39:10,400
He's so agile, like so quick agile that you can't even...

2318
02:39:10,400 --> 02:39:12,400
You can't even...

2319
02:39:18,400 --> 02:39:20,400
How does this get taken off of me?

2320
02:39:24,400 --> 02:39:26,400
Did you guys see how skinny my health bar was?

2321
02:39:26,400 --> 02:39:28,400
They went on to reset me.

2322
02:39:30,400 --> 02:39:32,400
I'm too scared to go into him after that move.

2323
02:39:34,400 --> 02:39:36,400
He's so agile and small.

2324
02:39:38,400 --> 02:39:40,400
I can't...

2325
02:39:40,400 --> 02:39:42,400
Right, he's like hiding from me.

2326
02:39:42,400 --> 02:39:44,400
There, I did 400 damage.

2327
02:39:46,400 --> 02:39:48,400
I did another cheeky 400.

2328
02:39:48,400 --> 02:39:50,400
No, no, no, no!

2329
02:39:50,400 --> 02:39:52,400
No!

2330
02:39:52,400 --> 02:39:54,400
Can someone do the final blow just while he's attacking me?

2331
02:39:54,400 --> 02:39:56,400
Just while he's attacking me, you know?

2332
02:39:56,400 --> 02:39:58,400
Thank you!

2333
02:39:58,400 --> 02:40:00,400
Thank you!

2334
02:40:00,400 --> 02:40:02,400
Yeah, I was stuck, you know?

2335
02:40:02,400 --> 02:40:04,400
I was stuck in a little hard position.

2336
02:40:06,400 --> 02:40:08,400
I got an achievement.

2337
02:40:08,400 --> 02:40:10,400
Mikhail with black play.

2338
02:40:12,400 --> 02:40:14,400
Oh, that's in time.

2339
02:40:18,400 --> 02:40:20,400
What is that?

2340
02:40:20,400 --> 02:40:22,400
What is that?

2341
02:40:24,400 --> 02:40:26,400
That's a fanny.

2342
02:40:28,400 --> 02:40:30,400
Sorry.

2343
02:40:30,400 --> 02:40:32,400
Absolute child.

2344
02:40:32,400 --> 02:40:34,400
And now the fire on the air dream can actually burn it.

2345
02:40:36,400 --> 02:40:38,400
It's a song.

2346
02:40:38,400 --> 02:40:42,400
Sorry, my graphics are on low, so I think that's supposed to be a bit higher.

2347
02:40:46,400 --> 02:40:48,400
Oh, death and death, okay.

2348
02:40:54,400 --> 02:40:56,400
So now the whole world can die now.

2349
02:41:02,400 --> 02:41:06,400
Oh, I forgot about those old wee waves at the table.

2350
02:41:20,400 --> 02:41:22,400
Does everyone know?

2351
02:41:24,400 --> 02:41:26,400
They're both the ones.

2352
02:41:32,400 --> 02:41:34,400
Oh, I forgot we did a wee bit of Orson.

2353
02:41:44,400 --> 02:41:48,400
You added the death set, so now the concept of death exists in between them.

2354
02:41:50,400 --> 02:41:52,400
Wee bit of fire, just a wee bit.

2355
02:41:52,400 --> 02:41:54,400
I just a wee bit, no.

2356
02:41:54,400 --> 02:41:56,400
Anyway, no, you didn't need to call it a wee fire, man.

2357
02:41:56,400 --> 02:41:58,400
It's fine.

2358
02:42:00,400 --> 02:42:02,400
Like, finally we can die.

2359
02:42:02,400 --> 02:42:08,400
Yeah, I thought there was some Elden Ring or like that, that were like, oh, we just want to die, but they can't.

2360
02:42:10,400 --> 02:42:12,400
They basically said I'm a muffin.

2361
02:42:12,400 --> 02:42:14,400
Please, I just want to die!

2362
02:42:16,400 --> 02:42:18,400
Have you had a muffin today?

2363
02:42:18,400 --> 02:42:24,400
Welcome to Ashen Capital.

2364
02:42:24,400 --> 02:42:28,400
Can you still stream Snape if I'm in this stage of the game?

2365
02:42:32,400 --> 02:42:34,400
Oh, well, that answered that question.

2366
02:42:34,400 --> 02:42:36,400
That answered that other question.

2367
02:42:42,400 --> 02:42:44,400
Oh, no, sorry, sorry, I sat down.

2368
02:42:44,400 --> 02:42:46,400
Hi!

2369
02:42:46,400 --> 02:42:48,400
Okay, let's check who hasn't had a show.

2370
02:42:48,400 --> 02:42:50,400
Gideon's Secret Love.

2371
02:42:50,400 --> 02:42:52,400
That's very specific.

2372
02:42:52,400 --> 02:42:54,400
I think you can't hear Gideon in his voice.

2373
02:42:54,400 --> 02:42:56,400
He's tapping that.

2374
02:42:56,400 --> 02:42:58,400
Gideon's Secret Love.

2375
02:42:58,400 --> 02:43:00,400
Who's not had a chance to do a good job?

2376
02:43:00,400 --> 02:43:04,400

2718
03:23:31,360 --> 03:23:35,040
in on the joke and we're and she doesn't feel like we're laughing at her i hope she's with us on the

2719
03:23:35,040 --> 03:23:42,960
joke uh the campaign and left for dead is four players failure rare for player consider playing

2720
03:23:42,960 --> 03:23:47,840
versus mode on left for dead but uh maybe play a match on normal first to get used to the game

2721
03:23:47,840 --> 03:23:51,680
and controls and then go against each other i feel like i'm gonna get walloped she's gonna get

2722
03:23:51,680 --> 03:23:55,600
annoyed that i'm on our team she's gonna be like no you go with the zombie bullshit bag you're shitting

2723
03:23:55,600 --> 03:24:00,400
at this giveaway okay so mommy said on versus mode but i think you might want to do it because you

2724
03:24:00,400 --> 03:24:04,720
don't know what it means basically it's a campaign based on the host choices with the team of four

2725
03:24:04,720 --> 03:24:08,880
humans and four zombies do the mission alternating between human and zombie and each team tries to

2726
03:24:08,880 --> 03:24:14,560
win but making it to the safe house by the end if you choose normal mode you can only get in one

2727
03:24:14,560 --> 03:24:21,680
refland and one here um but if you do that you can get way more okay um

2728
03:24:24,560 --> 03:24:30,400
hey mommy confession time oh we got our sin stream uh i was thinking about doing a confess your

2731
03:24:40,560 --> 03:24:44,240
in zombies you have to start jazz and kill off the humans one by one you can always just play

2738
03:25:24,240 --> 03:25:30,160
chicken not gonna lie just imagining you feeding us chicken thighs and breasts till we're almost full

2739
03:25:30,160 --> 03:25:35,040
but you say no refland you need to eat healthy so let me feed you till you're full then eventually

2740

2747
03:26:26,480 --> 03:26:29,600
when the blood look new items can be purchased from the twin medium plus

2748
03:26:31,600 --> 03:26:33,200
oh god i forgot like everything

2749
03:26:36,640 --> 03:26:41,600
i killed everyone oh wait there's that nice lady that she doesn't she doesn't leave master

2750
03:26:42,480 --> 03:26:47,040
she does leave master huig oh no does he even talk anymore

2751
03:26:53,360 --> 03:26:55,120
can he talk about himself anymore

2752
03:27:04,320 --> 03:27:07,760
she should be in this starting room or did i miss her

2753
03:27:08,640 --> 03:27:15,760
oh she is take a look around the round table holders

2754
03:27:17,760 --> 03:27:24,880
raised to the ground don't worry i don't blame you i'll continue spirit tuning

2755
03:27:24,880 --> 03:27:30,800
just the same as before which is why i need your help persuading master huig to leave

2756
03:27:31,520 --> 03:27:33,920
his roots are so knotted in this place

2757
03:27:41,760 --> 03:27:45,040
but he doesn't realize the round table behind him

2758
03:27:46,560 --> 03:27:51,040
i remember that what's happening so it wasn't just me this happened to

2759
03:27:52,000 --> 03:27:58,480
think he'd forget who you were as well yeah he'd burn himself out old huig

2760
03:27:59,120 --> 03:28:02,080
i think he once said you'll be forever his lord

2761
03:28:03,120 --> 03:28:10,480
but it's not the only way it's better that we don't it's only proper that we respect his choice

2762
03:28:10,480 --> 03:28:17,040
to stay isn't his choice if he's on his right mind i'll remain with he made me i'd like to return

2763
03:28:17,120 --> 03:28:24,560

lore when it comes to whammin who knows they they hit the nail on the head

2845
03:37:41,680 --> 03:37:52,960
sorry if i'm a bit late to the topic when i did frenzied flame the lady wouldn't speak to me

2846
03:37:52,960 --> 03:37:58,560
for most of the game because she now sees me as an enemy even when i got rid of the yeah i thought

2847
03:37:58,560 --> 03:38:05,920
she was gonna talk to me again and be like i'm mad at you but at least i'm alive yeah that did

2848
03:38:05,920 --> 03:38:12,160
not happen stash power we got played we got played we went through all of that to get that needle

2849
03:38:12,160 --> 03:38:19,760
to become unfrenzied and we got played kind of wish i just knew the place now kind of wish i just

2850
03:38:19,760 --> 03:38:32,800
kept it all honestly um malena says she'll kill you after the frenzy yeah so i took it off i kept her

2851
03:38:32,800 --> 03:38:39,200
alive uh no it's her purpose in life to fix things or at least in her eyes to sacrifice herself

2852
03:38:39,200 --> 03:38:44,400
yeah that's a brain rot she got from her mom how many enemies do you have left to finish the

2853
03:38:44,400 --> 03:38:51,200
we finished we did it i got carried all the way through the game we finished can't have

2854
03:38:51,200 --> 03:38:57,600
fingermaiden well time to burn everything literally we should have had you do hayata's

2855
03:38:57,920 --> 03:39:03,120
quest she becomes your new maiden for the frenzied ending oh that's cool

2856
03:39:04,640 --> 03:39:09,040
it's hayata that one that scared that was supposed to get grafted no no she's the one

2857
03:39:11,680 --> 03:39:16,880
she's probably pissed that she didn't get to do the arson herself until the end you still remain

2858
03:39:16,880 --> 03:39:27,200
maidenless how dare you she breeery how many endings does elden ring have

2859
03:39:29,200 --> 03:39:35,520
five apparently but two mean ones hayata dies when you get a frenzy

2860
03:39:36,480 --> 03:39:42,880
whoa maybe you can do the frenzied fire ending as a mage next time yeah that would be cool

2861
03:39:42,880 --> 03:39:46,400
i'm definitely doing magic next time i'll play this i'm definitely doing magic next time

2862
03:39:49,840 --> 03:39:53,040
i'm gonna do i'm gonna do

2863
03:39:57,920 --> 03:40:04,320
heavens lost property is a good anime oh that's a really good name in general though heavens lost

2864
03:40:04,320 --> 03:40:05,120
property

2865
03:40:07,600 --> 03:40:08,480
i should really enjoy that

2866
03:40:11,520 --> 03:40:15,520
so if you ever do fan meet up at convention what cosplays do you want to see a big guy do

2867
03:40:15,520 --> 03:40:21,680
him draw blanks other than roadhog from overwatch i don't know what cosplay

2868
03:40:24,320 --> 03:40:29,680
i'm trying to i can't think of what cosplay do you know i've ever seen those tiktoks where

2869
03:40:29,680 --> 03:40:34,320
it was like folk like thirsting over like the college you guys were like the masks on and that

2870
03:40:34,320 --> 03:40:39,600
i'm being like oh i'm so thirsty for this i never really got that i don't understand the mask thing

2871
03:40:39,600 --> 03:40:45,280
i think it's like a major uh special interest for the majority but i never understood the mask

2872
03:40:45,280 --> 03:40:56,480
thing hold on let me type it in why are women so interested in masks in the bedroom let's see

2873
03:40:56,480 --> 03:41:09,680
if we have a logical reasoning internet what are some reasons for a mask special interest

2874
03:41:12,160 --> 03:41:18,000
i have a mask special interest mask men are so mysterious and attractive especially masked

2875
03:41:18,000 --> 03:41:26,000
horror villains like ghostface jason there he's it's a shame there's not more villains like them

2876
03:41:27,440 --> 03:41:28,000
hmm

2877
03:41:30,960 --> 03:41:31,200
uh

2878
03:41:37,040 --> 03:41:44,160
because men have ugly faces it's raffling what are you wow where did that come from

2879
03:41:44,960 --> 03:41:52,000
masks provide a sense of anonymity so you can exit your comfort zone easier as well oh

2880
03:41:52,160 --> 03:42:01,520
oh so i can be even more molest that's terrible don't say that i would um i like to wear masks

2881
03:42:01,520 --> 03:42:06,320
because it gives me a sense of power of control on top of my dominance i feel like michael mayers

2882
03:42:06,320 --> 03:42:14,240
or jason burghese masks who the fuck is burghese master also uses a tool i cover my face to hide

2883
03:42:14,240 --> 03:42:19,040
my true self once i feel my sub has earned the right to see the real me i take it off and allow

2884
03:42:19,040 --> 03:42:25,760
them to kiss me oh that was that was so wholesome that just got really wholesome at the end there

2885
03:42:25,760 --> 03:42:30,640
i didn't expect that what nice little comment onto a little sprinkle
