WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:09.000
What is that noise? It sounds like the fire. Oh, there we go.

00:09.000 --> 00:14.000
Oh, he's like, this world is free.

00:14.000 --> 00:27.000
Whoa, this is too loud.

00:27.000 --> 00:29.000
3 A believes it.

00:29.000 --> 00:32.000
Brave.

00:32.000 --> 00:37.000
Obviously, I've jumped into the game.

00:37.000 --> 00:39.000
Oh, wait a minute.

00:39.000 --> 00:46.000
Oh, wait, can I hear myself?

00:46.000 --> 00:49.000
I can't hear myself.

00:49.000 --> 00:52.000
Get the oof.

00:52.000 --> 00:53.000
What am I?

00:53.000 --> 00:57.000
Mommy's here.

00:57.000 --> 01:03.000
I'm going to open it.

01:03.000 --> 01:09.000
Hi, good morning. Good evening.

01:09.000 --> 01:12.000
Good afternoon.

01:12.000 --> 01:17.000
How is that all fit to scale?

01:17.000 --> 01:21.000
Oh wait, that doesn't fit to scale at all, Roonlight.

01:21.000 --> 01:24.000
Was that like that last stream?

01:24.000 --> 01:29.000
It doesn't. Wait, why is this on top of the freaking thing?

01:29.000 --> 01:32.000
No, don't do that. That's even worse.

01:32.000 --> 01:35.000
Go below.

01:35.000 --> 01:37.000
Why is there two Roonlight?

01:37.000 --> 01:42.000
Is it the game capture's nice and loud?

01:42.000 --> 01:47.000
Okay, no, that looks correct. I just need to do that.

01:47.000 --> 01:50.000
Okay, Rinscape's just a funny-shaped game, okay?

01:50.000 --> 01:51.000
It's going to be scoff.

01:51.000 --> 01:53.000
It's just a funny-shaped game.

01:53.000 --> 01:57.000
I'm too dumb for to figure out.

01:57.000 --> 01:59.000
Is that a reflin?

01:59.000 --> 02:02.000
Reflin, you're already in?

02:02.000 --> 02:05.000
Other player has accepted?

02:05.000 --> 02:06.000
Okay.

02:06.000 --> 02:08.000
I'm like, that's a reflin, you're quick.

02:08.000 --> 02:10.000
We are in World High...

02:10.000 --> 02:12.000
Oh, it's replays.

02:12.000 --> 02:14.000
Hi, Red E. Blink.

02:14.000 --> 02:16.000
That's how I spell it.

02:16.000 --> 02:18.000
Damn, reflins are shown off.

02:18.000 --> 02:20.000
I'm not even freaking set.

02:20.000 --> 02:23.000
Oh, this is my update for today.

02:23.000 --> 02:25.000
No way, they have freaking Gangnam style

02:25.000 --> 02:28.000
and freaking Rinscape 07.

02:28.000 --> 02:29.000
Old school.

02:29.000 --> 02:32.000
I don't know why I said 07 though.

02:32.000 --> 02:35.000
Oh, my Gangnam style.

02:35.000 --> 02:37.000
Sexy reflin.

02:37.000 --> 02:40.000
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

02:40.000 --> 02:42.000
Gangnam style.

02:42.000 --> 02:44.000
Howdy-ow.

02:44.000 --> 02:48.000
Good morning, good evening, and good after noon.

02:48.000 --> 02:53.000
I hope you guys are ready for a cheeky endurance stream.

02:54.000 --> 02:55.000
Hi, reflings.

02:55.000 --> 02:57.000
Hi, Strawny, I guess.

02:57.000 --> 03:01.000
Yeah, I hope you're ready for a cheeky endurance today.

03:01.000 --> 03:06.000
I had a bit of business going on behind the scenes,

03:06.000 --> 03:08.000
business, business, business,

03:08.000 --> 03:12.000
so I hope to have quite a fun update soon.

03:12.000 --> 03:15.000
I've just told the girls what the business was,

03:15.000 --> 03:18.000
and someone's very excited.

03:18.000 --> 03:20.000
I just read their message,

03:21.000 --> 03:24.000
but I can't say or else spoilers.

03:24.000 --> 03:27.000
Let me open up my inventory so you guys can see what's up.

03:27.000 --> 03:29.000
Yes, we are business, business, business.

03:29.000 --> 03:35.000
Honestly, it feels really weird doing straight-up business, business, business.

03:35.000 --> 03:40.000
The only thing I'm used to is sponsorship people reaching out to me

03:40.000 --> 03:42.000
and being like, hey, for a 60-second segment,

03:42.000 --> 03:44.000
I will pay you this much.

03:44.000 --> 03:47.000
This is what is going on.

03:47.000 --> 03:49.000
And then I'm just like...

03:49.000 --> 03:51.000
I can't.

03:51.000 --> 03:56.000
But this time I got...

03:56.000 --> 03:59.000
I will talk about it a bit more.

03:59.000 --> 04:01.000
I'm going to ask permission if I can talk about it

04:01.000 --> 04:06.000
because the person is associated with an agency that helped out to...

04:06.000 --> 04:07.000
And if they're comfortable with it,

04:07.000 --> 04:08.000
I'm happy to talk about it.

04:08.000 --> 04:09.000
Obviously, nothing.

04:09.000 --> 04:11.000
Azur got monetized?

04:13.000 --> 04:15.000
Are you telling me Azur got monetized?

04:17.000 --> 04:20.000
I went to bed and Azur wasn't monetized.

04:20.000 --> 04:24.000
Sheevee was, which made me think within 24 hours Azur is getting reviewed next.

04:24.000 --> 04:28.000
I just hope her massive fucking honkers don't...

04:33.000 --> 04:36.000
I know Denpa isn't in here right now.

04:36.000 --> 04:38.000
Denpa's just messaged me.

04:38.000 --> 04:39.000
She's...

04:39.000 --> 04:41.000
Sean, I know you have a lot on your plate.

04:41.000 --> 04:42.000
Do you think AceMars is?

04:42.000 --> 04:44.000
What do you need Denpa?

04:44.000 --> 04:46.000
I won't charge.

04:46.000 --> 04:47.000
Denpa...

04:47.000 --> 04:50.000
I won't charge, darling.

04:50.000 --> 04:53.000
Oh Denpa, you're so adorable.

04:53.000 --> 04:55.000
Never charge friends.

04:55.000 --> 04:59.000
Always do it for free because when you have friends like these,

04:59.000 --> 05:01.000
life is good.

05:01.000 --> 05:04.000
I have not even known Denpa for more than two weeks

05:04.000 --> 05:06.000
and she's been nothing but a sweetheart to me.

05:06.000 --> 05:10.000
Right, I am going to go to the bank and clear out all my fissies in the background

05:10.000 --> 05:12.000
whilst I ramble to yours.

05:12.000 --> 05:15.000
I have absolutely terrible news.

05:15.000 --> 05:18.000
Just upshotting news.

05:18.000 --> 05:21.000
I tried to take a Jobay,

05:21.000 --> 05:23.000
but the Jobay wouldn't have come.

05:23.000 --> 05:28.000
So I'm probably going to have to take a big steamer in the middle of the stream,

05:28.000 --> 05:31.000
which I'm raging because I hate...

05:31.000 --> 05:32.000
Right, I don't...

05:32.000 --> 05:36.000
I'll always go for a shower after I do a big Jobay

05:36.000 --> 05:38.000
because I can't...

05:38.000 --> 05:40.000
Wait, should I just make a...

05:40.000 --> 05:42.000
I think it would actually be faster.

05:42.000 --> 05:43.000
Hold on, Refluence.

05:43.000 --> 05:46.000
I think it's going to be faster if I take wood out and...

05:50.000 --> 05:52.000
Do I even have wood?

05:54.000 --> 05:56.000
Do I even have an axe?

05:56.000 --> 05:57.000
It must...

05:57.000 --> 05:59.000
I do have an axe.

05:59.000 --> 06:02.000
Okay, then I need a tinderbox.

06:02.000 --> 06:04.000
Okay.

06:04.000 --> 06:06.000
I don't actually have a bit of wood.

06:06.000 --> 06:07.000
Right, that's fine though.

06:07.000 --> 06:08.000
We're going to go get it.

06:08.000 --> 06:12.000
Right, we'll chop here and then I'm going to make a fire outside the bank for now

06:13.000 --> 06:15.000
and eliminate all of my inventory.

06:18.000 --> 06:21.000
Oh, tiny cuttles wants to trade with you.

06:21.000 --> 06:22.000
What's your name?

06:22.000 --> 06:24.000
Little baby cuttles.

06:27.000 --> 06:28.000
Hi.

06:28.000 --> 06:30.000
Oh, you already given me one.

06:30.000 --> 06:31.000
Thank you.

06:31.000 --> 06:33.000
Yes, I will be needing these.

06:33.000 --> 06:35.000
Thank you very much.

06:35.000 --> 06:38.000
The best way to ruin friendship is to get money involved.

06:39.000 --> 06:43.000
I went until you learned about the development team drama.

06:43.000 --> 06:45.000
Oh my God!

06:45.000 --> 06:47.000
I've got a really funny fucking comment.

06:47.000 --> 06:50.000
So, you know how I'm always telling you about like,

06:50.000 --> 06:54.000
all I have on hand for wood right now,

06:54.000 --> 06:57.000
your wood is more than enough.

06:57.000 --> 07:00.000
Little Refling, I assure you.

07:00.000 --> 07:03.000
A winky face, because we all know what we're talking about.

07:04.000 --> 07:05.000
I'm a mod.

07:05.000 --> 07:06.000
Oh, damn, bullshit!

07:06.000 --> 07:08.000
I was talking about you.

07:12.000 --> 07:13.000
I'm so scared.

07:13.000 --> 07:15.000
I never streamed on YouTube.

07:15.000 --> 07:17.000
Oh, you don't actually have to mod anything.

07:17.000 --> 07:20.000
It's like customary to make you a mod

07:20.000 --> 07:26.000
so that you stand out more in chat.

07:26.000 --> 07:27.000
DEMPA, I'm so sorry.

07:27.000 --> 07:28.000
I was just exposing you.

07:28.000 --> 07:31.000
I just said that you wanted an ASMR script

07:31.000 --> 07:33.000
and I'm offering it for free

07:33.000 --> 07:35.000
because I would never charge you for that.

07:35.000 --> 07:37.000
You're freaking sick of just not...

07:37.000 --> 07:38.000
Wait, wait, wait.

07:38.000 --> 07:39.000
Let me pick up...

07:39.000 --> 07:40.000
I'm doing two things.

07:40.000 --> 07:42.000
Right, let me finish up the...

07:42.000 --> 07:44.000
Why did that only take out one?

07:44.000 --> 07:46.000
Oh, it's not looking good.

07:46.000 --> 07:48.000
Now you all know that I'm a RuneScape noob.

07:50.000 --> 07:52.000
Oh yeah, YouTube custom.

07:52.000 --> 07:53.000
Yes, you're learning right.

07:53.000 --> 07:55.000
Use Tinder box on the logs.

07:55.000 --> 07:58.000
Oh my God, you got a little cabbage head going on.

07:59.000 --> 08:01.000
Okay, right.

08:01.000 --> 08:03.000
Oh, I don't want to brag but I'm leveled to a fire making.

08:03.000 --> 08:05.000
Right, we are going to just get rid of...

08:05.000 --> 08:07.000
Not rid of, but...

08:10.000 --> 08:11.000
But yeah, you don't...

08:11.000 --> 08:14.000
Yeah, so as I was saying,

08:14.000 --> 08:17.000
we got a little hate comment today on YouTube

08:17.000 --> 08:20.000
but do you want to know why it's so funny?

08:20.000 --> 08:23.000
It's because most of the comments were like,

08:23.000 --> 08:26.000
vealers aren't going to last a month.

08:26.000 --> 08:29.000
And then it went to two months and it went to six months.

08:29.000 --> 08:33.000
Do you want to know what today's hate comment and quotation marks was

08:33.000 --> 08:35.000
that I had to delete?

08:35.000 --> 08:38.000
Vealers aren't going to last two years.

08:38.000 --> 08:41.000
Motherfucker, if vealers last two years,

08:41.000 --> 08:44.000
all three generations are successfully out.

08:44.000 --> 08:45.000
I don't...

08:45.000 --> 08:46.000
What?

08:46.000 --> 08:48.000
Are you dumb?

08:48.000 --> 08:50.000
I like how it went from not even going to last a week,

08:50.000 --> 08:52.000
not even going to last a month.

08:52.000 --> 08:53.000
Two years?

08:53.000 --> 08:55.000
Two years, all three gents are out.

08:55.000 --> 08:58.000
Vealers and I have succeeded in what I wanted to do.

09:00.000 --> 09:04.000
Literally just multiplied the time dramatically.

09:04.000 --> 09:06.000
And literally, it's a supportive message.

09:06.000 --> 09:08.000
I'm like, nice try, but...

09:08.000 --> 09:11.000
Wait, sorry, I think a reflim was trying to trade me.

09:11.000 --> 09:13.000
Sorry, sorry.

09:13.000 --> 09:16.000
I'm sorry, Brov, yet it didn't mean to not trade you.

09:16.000 --> 09:17.000
What?

09:19.000 --> 09:21.000
10,000 swordfish?

09:21.000 --> 09:23.000
Isn't that not like 99 right there?

09:23.000 --> 09:24.000
Am I going crazy?

09:24.000 --> 09:26.000
Are you sure?

09:26.000 --> 09:28.000
Oh my god!

09:30.000 --> 09:32.000
Oh my god!

09:32.000 --> 09:34.000
Wait, wait, wait, another reflim?

09:36.000 --> 09:37.000
Oh no.

09:37.000 --> 09:39.000
Oh my god, reflim.

09:39.000 --> 09:41.000
Alright, I'm getting drunk.

09:41.000 --> 09:43.000
I'm getting drunk as a skunk.

09:43.000 --> 09:44.000
Actually,

09:44.000 --> 09:48.000
I think we're doing drunk stream near the end.

09:48.000 --> 09:50.000
Helps make the job happen.

09:51.000 --> 09:52.000
I literally got like,

09:52.000 --> 09:54.000
freaking 10 kabillion.

09:54.000 --> 09:56.000
Right, thank you, let's go for a job.

09:56.000 --> 09:58.000
Let me drink that, let me eat.

09:58.000 --> 10:00.000
Oh, love the little bubble sound effect.

10:00.000 --> 10:02.000
If I ever make a song, like an actual song,

10:02.000 --> 10:04.000
like a custom made song,

10:04.000 --> 10:06.000
oh my god, 10,000 swordfish.

10:10.000 --> 10:12.000
Oh my gosh.

10:12.000 --> 10:14.000
Right, in order

10:16.000 --> 10:18.000
to make this super simple,

10:18.000 --> 10:20.000
I'm so sorry for anyone who like,

10:20.000 --> 10:23.000
is really good at organizing their shit.

10:23.000 --> 10:24.000
I'm not.

10:24.000 --> 10:26.000
I'm literally just going to shove

10:26.000 --> 10:28.000
all the fish items to the top.

10:28.000 --> 10:30.000
Please don't judge me.

10:30.000 --> 10:32.000
Please don't judge me.

10:32.000 --> 10:34.000
Right, I'm pretty sure that's all the shit.

10:34.000 --> 10:36.000
Raw trout, you as well.

10:36.000 --> 10:38.000
Raw herring, you as well.

10:38.000 --> 10:40.000
And that's cooked salmon.

10:40.000 --> 10:42.000
Oh god, what a bank.

10:42.000 --> 10:44.000
Gee, gee, willikers, I sure hope no one

10:44.000 --> 10:46.000
cracks into a skullfish.

10:46.000 --> 10:48.000
I think members later, it'll get faster.

10:48.000 --> 10:50.000
One morban, literally.

10:50.000 --> 10:52.000
Right, shrimp, we're going to cook

10:52.000 --> 10:54.000
all the shrimp right now.

10:54.000 --> 10:56.000
Unless the fire is out, I think the fire is out.

10:56.000 --> 10:58.000
Okay, wait, no, someone's lighting the beacon.

10:58.000 --> 11:00.000
Gondor calls for aid.

11:00.000 --> 11:02.000
We're just going to clean up our inventory.

11:02.000 --> 11:04.000
I say that as if we didn't just get 10,000

11:04.000 --> 11:06.000
freaking fish, thank you very much.

11:06.000 --> 11:08.000
Desme, I'm glad I could help, thank you.

11:08.000 --> 11:10.000
Bank tabs and shambles, I'm so sorry.

11:10.000 --> 11:12.000
I know people are really good at like,

11:12.000 --> 11:14.000
organizing their tabs.

11:14.000 --> 11:16.000
I just couldn't, I'm just like, in and out, let's go.

11:16.000 --> 11:18.000
She's a hoarder.

11:18.000 --> 11:20.000
But she's our hoarder.

11:20.000 --> 11:22.000
Vsucky is done for.

11:22.000 --> 11:24.000
They can't compete with Vila,

11:24.000 --> 11:26.000
literally.

11:26.000 --> 11:28.000
I bet you Vila won't last until

11:28.000 --> 11:30.000
Vila's stuff exists then.

11:30.000 --> 11:32.000
Isn't it interesting?

11:32.000 --> 11:34.000
It's cooking me right now.

11:34.000 --> 11:36.000
Well, you might only last two years,

11:36.000 --> 11:38.000
but that's still a year.

11:38.000 --> 11:40.000
22 months, 30 days,

11:40.000 --> 11:42.000
23 hours,

11:42.000 --> 11:44.000
59 minutes and 59

11:44.000 --> 11:46.000
seconds longer than he probably lasts

11:46.000 --> 11:48.000
when he touches a woman.

11:48.000 --> 11:50.000
Bro, literally, oh wait,

11:50.000 --> 11:52.000
whoa, whoa, whoa, wait, did you just,

11:52.000 --> 11:54.000
did you just roast him?

11:54.000 --> 11:56.000
Thank you for the tip, Toria.

11:56.000 --> 11:58.000
I was like, oh yeah, yeah, yeah, until you

11:58.000 --> 12:00.000
I heard the very last sentence.

12:00.000 --> 12:02.000
I was like, Brian?

12:02.000 --> 12:04.000
Brian?

12:04.000 --> 12:06.000
Oh my gosh.

12:06.000 --> 12:08.000
That was,

12:08.000 --> 12:10.000
I didn't expect that at all.

12:10.000 --> 12:12.000
I can put this away because there's a kind

12:12.000 --> 12:14.000
reflin makin' fires, right?

12:14.000 --> 12:16.000
We'll do anchovies, we'll do

12:16.000 --> 12:18.000
the...

12:18.000 --> 12:20.000
No, don't eat.

12:20.000 --> 12:22.000
Oh wait, they're cooked.

12:22.000 --> 12:24.000
My apologies, such a fake

12:24.000 --> 12:26.000
gamer, for I cannot hide.

12:26.000 --> 12:28.000
Oh my god, reflies are like starting a

12:28.000 --> 12:30.000
frickin' fire outside the bank.

12:30.000 --> 12:32.000
Wait a minute, I'm not the rock

12:32.000 --> 12:34.000
well uprising.

12:34.000 --> 12:36.000
I was naughty.

12:36.000 --> 12:38.000
I'm not there all the time.

12:38.000 --> 12:40.000
I'm just, I'll put my hand up

12:40.000 --> 12:42.000
and I'll say I'm not there all the time.

12:42.000 --> 12:44.000
I had a little peek yesterday

12:44.000 --> 12:46.000
about what you've all been

12:46.000 --> 12:48.000
anonymously chatting about

12:48.000 --> 12:50.000
and someone said,

12:50.000 --> 12:52.000
yes, Johnny, I understand

12:52.000 --> 12:54.000
Blackwell

12:54.000 --> 12:56.000
headquarters.

12:56.000 --> 12:58.000
And I was like, ah,

12:58.000 --> 13:00.000
that's so fuckin' funny.

13:00.000 --> 13:02.000
So yeah, your comment got me excited.

13:02.000 --> 13:04.000
I just seen someone,

13:04.000 --> 13:06.000
someone's like ritual posting

13:06.000 --> 13:08.000
about Shoebe and it's like, I am nothing but trash.

13:08.000 --> 13:10.000
Under Shoebe's foot and I'm like, yes, yes, yes.

13:10.000 --> 13:12.000
Then the OG

13:12.000 --> 13:14.000
Sands, I was checking the OG Sands out.

13:14.000 --> 13:16.000
They were spoiling, I see.

13:16.000 --> 13:18.000
Absolutely spoiling it. Hey, Johnny, off topic question.

13:18.000 --> 13:20.000
What's your tip

13:20.000 --> 13:22.000
for Germany, Scotland today?

13:22.000 --> 13:24.000
Is there a football match on?

13:24.000 --> 13:26.000
Use logs on fire to make

13:26.000 --> 13:28.000
bonfire, we'll not go out.

13:28.000 --> 13:30.000
Isn't that all RuneScape 3?

13:30.000 --> 13:32.000
I don't think that's a thing here.

13:32.000 --> 13:34.000
What about having

13:34.000 --> 13:36.000
many fires?

13:38.000 --> 13:40.000
Any thoughts on doing an Iron Man

13:40.000 --> 13:42.000
so chat can't just give you everything?

13:42.000 --> 13:44.000
V-Bop

13:44.000 --> 13:46.000
you have far too much

13:46.000 --> 13:48.000
faith in me. I'm not even going to pretend otherwise.

13:48.000 --> 13:50.000
I know I'm not

13:50.000 --> 13:52.000
supposed to name chatters,

13:52.000 --> 13:54.000
but my guy,

13:54.000 --> 13:56.000
you have far too much faith in me to think that I could do.

13:56.000 --> 13:58.000
The only way I could do this on my own

13:58.000 --> 14:00.000
is by picking up

14:00.000 --> 14:02.000
dropped fish in Barbarian Village.

14:02.000 --> 14:04.000
That is the only way I know how to do it.

14:04.000 --> 14:06.000
Because I don't have the funds.

14:06.000 --> 14:08.000
I don't know how to make money in this game.

14:08.000 --> 14:10.000
And we'd be at this for hours.

14:10.000 --> 14:12.000
Squidding me right now.

14:12.000 --> 14:14.000
Since

14:14.000 --> 14:16.000
strong debut, something about her reminded me

14:16.000 --> 14:18.000
of a Pokémon.

14:18.000 --> 14:20.000
It has been on the tip of my tongue for an entire week.

14:20.000 --> 14:22.000
And I finally figured it looks

14:22.000 --> 14:24.000
like a Cray Dilly if it was an anime girl.

14:26.000 --> 14:28.000
A Cray Dilly? Hold on.

14:28.000 --> 14:30.000
You're actually getting me a look up something.

14:30.000 --> 14:32.000
A Cray Dilly Pokémon.

14:36.000 --> 14:38.000
Oh!

14:38.000 --> 14:40.000
I know them. They're in Groovy.

14:40.000 --> 14:42.000
Kill things to make money.

14:42.000 --> 14:44.000
Kill go-

14:44.000 --> 14:46.000
Bro, goblins don't drop money.

14:46.000 --> 14:48.000
The most expensive item

14:48.000 --> 14:50.000
goblins drop is Goblin Mail,

14:50.000 --> 14:52.000
which is 500 a piece purely because it's a quest item.

14:52.000 --> 14:54.000
Thank you, Thierry, for the other tip as well.

14:54.000 --> 14:56.000
Honestly, I could see that.

14:56.000 --> 14:58.000
Yeah, the fossil type.

14:58.000 --> 15:00.000
Goblins are the best.

15:00.000 --> 15:02.000
You're trolling me.

15:02.000 --> 15:04.000
I'm getting trolled.

15:04.000 --> 15:06.000
There's no way you guys actually think that.

15:08.000 --> 15:10.000
I got my first Bond via marbles on stream.

15:12.000 --> 15:14.000
I wish you could do marbles on stream

15:14.000 --> 15:16.000
on

15:16.000 --> 15:18.000
thingy.

15:18.000 --> 15:20.000
On YouTube.

15:20.000 --> 15:22.000
But things are very slowly getting

15:22.000 --> 15:24.000
integrated to YouTube.

15:24.000 --> 15:26.000
But I

15:26.000 --> 15:28.000
I definitely feel YouTube

15:28.000 --> 15:30.000
is becoming stronger and stronger

15:30.000 --> 15:32.000
for streamers.

15:32.000 --> 15:34.000
And like

15:34.000 --> 15:36.000
I think what we're saying

15:36.000 --> 15:38.000
that discoverability

15:38.000 --> 15:40.000
who dare at

15:40.000 --> 15:42.000
DEMPO

15:42.000 --> 15:44.000
I don't know if you're still lurking.

15:44.000 --> 15:46.000
DEMPO goes, I didn't think that far ahead.

15:46.000 --> 15:48.000
What do you think would be cute? I think she likes the kind of

15:48.000 --> 15:50.000
creepier it is. I'll write some creepy stuff.

15:52.000 --> 15:54.000
You were strong, we were rooting for Scotland today

15:54.000 --> 15:56.000
for years. Oh, we're going to do shite.

15:56.000 --> 15:58.000
But it's fine. It's fine.

15:58.000 --> 16:00.000
The life of a Scottish

16:00.000 --> 16:02.000
national

16:02.000 --> 16:04.000
Wait, no, hold on. Nationality of a Scottish person.

16:04.000 --> 16:06.000
Because we understand we're just terrible.

16:06.000 --> 16:08.000
Although we're decent at rugby

16:08.000 --> 16:10.000
I'll be honest, we're actually no rough at rugby.

16:10.000 --> 16:12.000
But the fit ball

16:12.000 --> 16:14.000
The fit ball, if you didn't know

16:14.000 --> 16:16.000
and to say football

16:16.000 --> 16:18.000
in Scotland, you say fit

16:18.000 --> 16:20.000
like FIT. But no pronunciation

16:20.000 --> 16:22.000
on the T. And then ball.

16:22.000 --> 16:24.000
How?

16:24.000 --> 16:26.000
I'm okay with that.

16:26.000 --> 16:28.000
I feel like

16:28.000 --> 16:30.000
YouTube could make discoverability so much better.

16:30.000 --> 16:32.000
See, I think it does

16:32.000 --> 16:34.000
enough. It's Twitch that has poor

16:34.000 --> 16:36.000
discoverability. However,

16:36.000 --> 16:38.000
people disagree with me when I say that.

16:38.000 --> 16:40.000
And I'm like, oh, okay.

16:40.000 --> 16:42.000
I actually thought

16:42.000 --> 16:44.000
Shawnee literally never leaves

16:44.000 --> 16:46.000
her arms until she may.

16:46.000 --> 16:48.000
I just believe.

16:48.000 --> 16:50.000
Bond lid, thank you for

16:50.000 --> 16:52.000
coming. I remember.

16:52.000 --> 16:54.000
Enjoy the emotes back.

16:54.000 --> 16:56.000
The girls emotes have been ordered.

16:56.000 --> 16:58.000
I do have a bit of bad news

16:58.000 --> 17:00.000
about it though. The person

17:00.000 --> 17:02.000
that I get them done by, they're like

17:02.000 --> 17:04.000
it'll take me a month. And I'm like

17:04.000 --> 17:06.000
excuse me?

17:06.000 --> 17:08.000
A month? And they're like, yeah, a month.

17:08.000 --> 17:10.000
Is that okay? And I'm like, I guess.

17:10.000 --> 17:12.000
And then

17:12.000 --> 17:14.000
they're like, oh, but

17:14.000 --> 17:16.000
we've also put the base price up. And I'm like, oh,

17:16.000 --> 17:18.000
okay then.

17:18.000 --> 17:20.000
Okay, that's fine then.

17:20.000 --> 17:22.000
And I'm like, okay,

17:22.000 --> 17:24.000
that's just kind of the worst of all worlds.

17:26.000 --> 17:28.000
But yeah, everyone else

17:28.000 --> 17:30.000
is going to get emotes before me.

17:30.000 --> 17:32.000
I'm submitting everyone else's emotes before me

17:32.000 --> 17:34.000
because I don't think it's fair.

17:34.000 --> 17:36.000
My reeflings, you know how

17:36.000 --> 17:38.000
unbelievably well

17:38.000 --> 17:40.000
behaved you are for me and how patient.

17:40.000 --> 17:42.000
And it's nicer for the girls

17:42.000 --> 17:44.000
to have something to celebrate

17:44.000 --> 17:46.000
because you already know I'm going to be

17:46.000 --> 17:48.000
here every day.

17:48.000 --> 17:50.000
Oh, I was saying

17:50.000 --> 17:52.000
that my first drunk stream

17:52.000 --> 17:54.000
I'm not sure how much people

17:54.000 --> 17:56.000
are going to like this. And I can already see

17:56.000 --> 17:58.000
some of you typing and rolling your

17:58.000 --> 18:00.000
eyes. Keep your eyes to the

18:00.000 --> 18:02.000
front of your head. I don't want one eye

18:02.000 --> 18:04.000
rolling to the back of the skull.

18:04.000 --> 18:06.000
What was I saying?

18:10.000 --> 18:12.000
My first drunk

18:12.000 --> 18:14.000
stream was going to be

18:14.000 --> 18:16.000
a

18:16.000 --> 18:18.000
drunk apex, but I don't go

18:18.000 --> 18:20.000
offline until we win.

18:20.000 --> 18:22.000
But, okay.

18:22.000 --> 18:24.000
How did you time that?

18:24.000 --> 18:26.000
There's a stream delay. How did you

18:26.000 --> 18:28.000
even time that?

18:28.000 --> 18:30.000
Fucking reefling in game said

18:30.000 --> 18:32.000
eye roll. How did you time that?

18:32.000 --> 18:34.000
A 30

18:34.000 --> 18:36.000
hour stream. Oh, I thought that.

18:36.000 --> 18:38.000
But then I was like, would you guys rather

18:38.000 --> 18:40.000
jellybean game? Some sort of drunk

18:40.000 --> 18:42.000
multiplayer game.

18:42.000 --> 18:44.000
So the stream is just never going to end, pretty much.

18:44.000 --> 18:46.000
Apex. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

18:46.000 --> 18:48.000
Everyone is like dunking on apex.

18:48.000 --> 18:50.000
Well, there's other multiplayer games

18:50.000 --> 18:52.000
we can play if you'd rather drunk

18:52.000 --> 18:54.000
that. But I feel like drunk jellybean

18:54.000 --> 18:56.000
is just going to be me like

18:56.000 --> 18:58.000
please, please

18:58.000 --> 19:00.000
please let me, let me

19:00.000 --> 19:02.000
get to the past and first level

19:02.000 --> 19:04.000
please

19:04.000 --> 19:06.000
I don't want to spectate.

19:06.000 --> 19:08.000
And I'll be drunk and hold up.

19:08.000 --> 19:10.000
Why is so much fire? You had drunk

19:10.000 --> 19:12.000
runes. How is drunk runescape fun?

19:12.000 --> 19:14.000
I put the

19:14.000 --> 19:16.000
shrimp on the

19:16.000 --> 19:18.000
fire.

19:18.000 --> 19:20.000
It cooks the shrimp

19:20.000 --> 19:22.000
and my level

19:22.000 --> 19:24.000
gets higher.

19:24.000 --> 19:26.000
Drunk fire cave.

19:26.000 --> 19:28.000
Oh, got drunk.

19:28.000 --> 19:30.000
Accidentally achieved 99

19:30.000 --> 19:32.000
fletching.

19:32.000 --> 19:34.000
Runescape is never fun.

19:34.000 --> 19:36.000
You drink every time you make an alcoholic

19:36.000 --> 19:38.000
drink.

19:38.000 --> 19:40.000
Don't let you get past level one

19:40.000 --> 19:42.000
this time around.

19:42.000 --> 19:44.000
That's what I'm worried about

19:44.000 --> 19:46.000
the true endurance stream for real

19:46.000 --> 19:48.000
for real. Well bank the bank

19:48.000 --> 19:50.000
runescape is a job

19:50.000 --> 19:52.000
but honestly, that's funny.

19:52.000 --> 19:54.000
Oh wait, no, that's kik chuna

19:54.000 --> 19:56.000
but you're unkik

19:56.000 --> 19:58.000
true herring.

19:58.000 --> 20:00.000
Castle wars is

20:00.000 --> 20:02.000
for you play. Hydration, I need

20:02.000 --> 20:04.000
to finish my tea.

20:08.000 --> 20:10.000
Which

20:10.000 --> 20:12.000
yes

20:12.000 --> 20:14.000
I

20:14.000 --> 20:16.000
I've

20:16.000 --> 20:18.000
also planned out

20:18.000 --> 20:20.000
the membership

20:20.000 --> 20:22.000
streams for next week. Again

20:22.000 --> 20:24.000
if you are unable to member, please don't

20:24.000 --> 20:26.000
worry.

20:26.000 --> 20:28.000
Dear little reeflings, I stream

20:28.000 --> 20:30.000
every single day free access.

20:32.000 --> 20:34.000
What movie did I pick?

20:34.000 --> 20:36.000
I think I might have picked

20:36.000 --> 20:38.000
Austin Powers

20:38.000 --> 20:40.000
for the movie

20:40.000 --> 20:42.000
question mark. How are you keeping this

20:42.000 --> 20:44.000
up?

20:44.000 --> 20:46.000
I don't know. I thought you could only have one

20:48.000 --> 20:50.000
or she'll start leaking secret.

20:50.000 --> 20:52.000
No, I shut off about all the insider

20:52.000 --> 20:54.000
stuff now. I'm starting to leak it.

20:54.000 --> 20:56.000
Well, I've not said anything that I've

20:56.000 --> 20:58.000
regret saying. I don't

20:58.000 --> 21:00.000
regret being like, yeah, we

21:00.000 --> 21:02.000
don't need talent managers

21:02.000 --> 21:04.000
because it turns out if you give

21:04.000 --> 21:06.000
it a try.

21:06.000 --> 21:08.000
Actually, I would like to expand upon that

21:08.000 --> 21:10.000
point. Now that you've got me on that

21:10.000 --> 21:12.000
subject, hold on a minute little reefling.

21:12.000 --> 21:14.000
The reason why talent

21:14.000 --> 21:16.000
managers aren't necessarily needed

21:16.000 --> 21:18.000
is because these girls have streamed

21:18.000 --> 21:20.000
and they have plenty of experience.

21:20.000 --> 21:22.000
Who goes there?

21:22.000 --> 21:24.000
And

21:24.000 --> 21:26.000
to

21:26.000 --> 21:28.000
go from independent

21:28.000 --> 21:30.000
where you pick your streams and you pick

21:30.000 --> 21:32.000
everything and then you're on a one week

21:32.000 --> 21:34.000
interval every week to stream what you want.

21:34.000 --> 21:36.000
It just doesn't make sense or it doesn't make

21:36.000 --> 21:38.000
sense to me, okay?

21:38.000 --> 21:40.000
So, yeah.

21:40.000 --> 21:42.000
Sad I'm going to miss the first membership stream.

21:42.000 --> 21:44.000
I mean, you can always go back and watch the VODs.

21:44.000 --> 21:46.000
At any point you become

21:46.000 --> 21:48.000
a member, you can access the VODs

21:48.000 --> 21:50.000
on the membership

21:50.000 --> 21:52.000
strums. I just need to

21:52.000 --> 21:54.000
once I make

21:54.000 --> 21:56.000
the lobbies for them,

21:56.000 --> 21:58.000
I just need to make sure I do it for the correct

21:58.000 --> 22:00.000
membership here.

22:00.000 --> 22:02.000
Holy crap, we're creeping on the next level.

22:02.000 --> 22:04.000
I actually don't know what level we are.

22:04.000 --> 22:06.000
We're level 52. We're about to be

22:06.000 --> 22:08.000
53. We're slowly creeping

22:08.000 --> 22:10.000
up.

22:10.000 --> 22:12.000
Wait, are they flirting? What's going on here?

22:12.000 --> 22:14.000
Agility. Construction

22:14.000 --> 22:16.000
and slayer.

22:16.000 --> 22:18.000
Oh, we're all debating on what... I thought

22:18.000 --> 22:20.000
runecrafting was unanimously voted the worst.

22:20.000 --> 22:22.000
It's

22:22.000 --> 22:24.000
stressful with a manager.

22:24.000 --> 22:26.000
I just feel very strongly

22:26.000 --> 22:28.000
that

22:28.000 --> 22:30.000
I mean, obviously in my instance

22:30.000 --> 22:32.000
the girls in that are happy for me

22:32.000 --> 22:34.000
to say all of them streamed way longer

22:34.000 --> 22:36.000
than me. Why would they need to come

22:36.000 --> 22:38.000
to me for permission to stream?

22:38.000 --> 22:40.000
It just seems rather odd,

22:40.000 --> 22:42.000
you know?

22:42.000 --> 22:44.000
It just doesn't make any sense.

22:46.000 --> 22:48.000
Mooncrafting has

22:48.000 --> 22:50.000
a minigame now. Oh, to make it faster?

22:54.000 --> 22:56.000
I'm thinking of how many watch hours I need

22:56.000 --> 22:58.000
to pack up when I get home though. Honestly though...

23:00.000 --> 23:02.000
I've planned out

23:02.000 --> 23:04.000
the

23:04.000 --> 23:06.000
Elden Ring streams

23:08.000 --> 23:10.000
but

23:10.000 --> 23:12.000
I just realised I might have to delay it by a day

23:12.000 --> 23:14.000
because of time zones. I don't know

23:14.000 --> 23:16.000
if the DLC has a time zone release

23:16.000 --> 23:18.000
but from being

23:18.000 --> 23:20.000
an upside down land

23:20.000 --> 23:22.000
whenever there's an ad for a game

23:22.000 --> 23:24.000
and it's like, this game comes out on this day

23:24.000 --> 23:26.000
and I'm like, well that's a lie

23:26.000 --> 23:28.000
because it's not time synced

23:30.000 --> 23:32.000
because I'm in the future, right now I'm in the future

23:32.000 --> 23:34.000
it's 4am on the 15th

23:34.000 --> 23:36.000
like I'm in the future, you know?

23:38.000 --> 23:40.000
So I might have accidentally planned

23:40.000 --> 23:42.000
my Elden Ring stream a day too early

23:42.000 --> 23:44.000
before the DLC comes out

23:44.000 --> 23:46.000
but then again

23:46.000 --> 23:48.000
we could play it

23:48.000 --> 23:50.000
early. Actually, no

23:50.000 --> 23:52.000
there's not going to be a problem

23:52.000 --> 23:54.000
with being able to be at the DLC anyway

23:54.000 --> 23:56.000
because we're starting fresh

23:56.000 --> 23:58.000
How's the future?

23:58.000 --> 24:00.000
I mean

24:00.000 --> 24:02.000
it's alright

24:02.000 --> 24:04.000
I ain't got much of a quarrel with it

24:06.000 --> 24:08.000
That's a lot of marks of grace

24:08.000 --> 24:10.000
yes, that's going to be

24:10.000 --> 24:12.000
a major endurance stream

24:12.000 --> 24:14.000
back to back

24:14.000 --> 24:16.000
I've planned 4 days

24:16.000 --> 24:18.000
around it

24:18.000 --> 24:20.000
it might leak into a 5th day

24:20.000 --> 24:22.000
but I'm sorry to anyone watching that

24:22.000 --> 24:24.000
Elden Ring isn't your thing

24:24.000 --> 24:26.000
you know?

24:26.000 --> 24:28.000
Arise, you tarnish

24:28.000 --> 24:30.000
Do you have a save file ready?

24:30.000 --> 24:32.000
No, I was going to start fresh

24:34.000 --> 24:36.000
I was going to start from the beginning

24:36.000 --> 24:38.000
yeah, because I like when you guys get to

24:38.000 --> 24:40.000
hold my hand

24:40.000 --> 24:42.000
through the stream

24:42.000 --> 24:44.000
and someone said a marshmallow

24:44.000 --> 24:46.000
and I was like, can we invade?

24:46.000 --> 24:48.000
and I'm like, that's actually what we do

24:48.000 --> 24:50.000
and then one reekling comes in

24:50.000 --> 24:52.000
as an invader or enemy

24:52.000 --> 24:54.000
and it means we can safely walk around

24:54.000 --> 24:56.000
the areas and stuff

24:56.000 --> 24:58.000
I didn't know if I should bring out the shock caller

24:58.000 --> 25:00.000
so every time I perish

25:00.000 --> 25:02.000
you guys get to shock me

25:02.000 --> 25:04.000
I don't know if that's a bit too weird though

25:04.000 --> 25:06.000
for what we're...

25:06.000 --> 25:08.000
I feel like it's more going to be like nostalgia run

25:08.000 --> 25:10.000
of all of us being like, I remember this

25:10.000 --> 25:12.000
I remember that, I remember when we did this

25:12.000 --> 25:14.000
remember when we did that

25:14.000 --> 25:16.000
and then I've just got a shock caller going

25:16.000 --> 25:18.000
every time

25:18.000 --> 25:20.000
every time I mess up

25:24.000 --> 25:26.000
I will probably be on here rinsking

25:26.000 --> 25:28.000
during that, oh I need to finish my tea

25:34.000 --> 25:36.000
I've been making my teas

25:36.000 --> 25:38.000
with far too much honey, it's rubbish

25:38.000 --> 25:40.000
alcohol poisoning

25:40.000 --> 25:42.000
no, I cannot

25:42.000 --> 25:44.000
drink and play rinsking

25:44.000 --> 25:46.000
Elden Ring, there's no chance of that

25:46.000 --> 25:48.000
the shock caller

25:48.000 --> 25:50.000
is with Sin, I actually need to message her

25:50.000 --> 25:52.000
because unfortunately

25:52.000 --> 25:54.000
I need to delay that stream due to

25:54.000 --> 25:56.000
obligations

25:58.000 --> 26:00.000
because essentially week 3

26:00.000 --> 26:02.000
is Elden Ring and then it would be week 4

26:02.000 --> 26:04.000
Elden Ring with Sin and

26:04.000 --> 26:06.000
I think that would

26:06.000 --> 26:08.000
alienate

26:08.000 --> 26:10.000
too many

26:10.000 --> 26:12.000
supporters being like, oh god

26:12.000 --> 26:14.000
get off that game already

26:14.000 --> 26:16.000
you can do it, don't let

26:16.000 --> 26:18.000
you get in the way

26:18.000 --> 26:20.000
don't let yourself get in the way

26:20.000 --> 26:22.000
honestly

26:22.000 --> 26:24.000
I do have a fun update for those of you

26:24.000 --> 26:26.000
who enjoy seeing my hands

26:26.000 --> 26:28.000
I have successfully ordered

26:28.000 --> 26:30.000
the Uwu Market

26:30.000 --> 26:32.000
keychains

26:32.000 --> 26:34.000
and merchandise

26:34.000 --> 26:36.000
I bought my own merchandise

26:36.000 --> 26:38.000
but I got a discount code and all that

26:38.000 --> 26:40.000
I've got the keychains

26:40.000 --> 26:42.000
of all the girls coming

26:42.000 --> 26:44.000
so I'm going to do

26:44.000 --> 26:46.000
a little hand ASMR soon

26:46.000 --> 26:48.000
for anyone

26:48.000 --> 26:50.000
now don't worry this content

26:50.000 --> 26:52.000
will be made public that I'm about to discuss

26:52.000 --> 26:54.000
for anyone who is currently on

26:54.000 --> 26:56.000
Patreon

26:56.000 --> 26:58.000
they got early access to

26:58.000 --> 27:00.000
a YouTube video

27:00.000 --> 27:02.000
which was absolutely outrageous

27:02.000 --> 27:04.000
but I'm just wanting to know

27:04.000 --> 27:06.000
if anyone in chat did

27:06.000 --> 27:08.000
listen to that outrageous

27:08.000 --> 27:10.000
audio and what were your thoughts about it

27:12.000 --> 27:14.000
I'm also using my Patreon

27:14.000 --> 27:16.000
as a big

27:16.000 --> 27:18.000
archive of anything that I produce

27:18.000 --> 27:20.000
sadly

27:20.000 --> 27:22.000
four audios are unable to be

27:22.000 --> 27:24.000
uploaded to it because I was

27:24.000 --> 27:26.000
very dumb

27:26.000 --> 27:28.000
I've made a four part

27:28.000 --> 27:30.000
series

27:30.000 --> 27:32.000
that has hypnosis in it

27:32.000 --> 27:34.000
but Patreon actually doesn't allow

27:34.000 --> 27:36.000
that so I'm going

27:36.000 --> 27:38.000
to upload it on my alt

27:38.000 --> 27:40.000
twitter for free not a problem

27:40.000 --> 27:42.000
I just need to edit it and get out the way

27:42.000 --> 27:44.000
but it means

27:44.000 --> 27:46.000
I'm now missing four audios

27:48.000 --> 27:50.000
raw tuna

27:50.000 --> 27:52.000
that's cooked that's cooked that's cooked

27:52.000 --> 27:54.000
that's cooked so lobster

27:54.000 --> 27:56.000
tuna and then we tackle the

27:56.000 --> 27:58.000
10k freaking

27:58.000 --> 28:00.000
sword fish

28:00.000 --> 28:02.000
this is going to be interesting

28:02.000 --> 28:04.000
I keep running out of love

28:04.000 --> 28:06.000
are the hoodies

28:06.000 --> 28:08.000
no nothing is

28:08.000 --> 28:10.000
limited by ubu market

28:10.000 --> 28:12.000
actually I need to talk to them

28:12.000 --> 28:14.000
again because

28:14.000 --> 28:16.000
Azura is coming up

28:20.000 --> 28:22.000
y'all

28:22.000 --> 28:24.000
why does he not like hypnosis

28:24.000 --> 28:26.000
Mastercard our

28:26.000 --> 28:28.000
unloved overlords

28:28.000 --> 28:30.000
have deemed that hypnosis

28:30.000 --> 28:32.000
is in

28:32.000 --> 28:34.000
consensual for some reason

28:34.000 --> 28:36.000
even though it fully is like you will never do

28:36.000 --> 28:38.000
something that you don't want to do

28:40.000 --> 28:42.000
and unfortunately

28:42.000 --> 28:44.000
Patreon always have to bend the knee

28:44.000 --> 28:46.000
a lot of people have issues with Patreon

28:46.000 --> 28:48.000
but the reality of the situation is

28:48.000 --> 28:50.000
our overlords that we despise

28:50.000 --> 28:52.000
the ones who are on Epstein island

28:52.000 --> 28:54.000
all the time but

28:54.000 --> 28:56.000
deem hypnosis as non consensual

28:56.000 --> 28:58.000
so it cannot be

28:58.000 --> 29:00.000
uploaded to Patreon however

29:00.000 --> 29:02.000
for some

29:02.000 --> 29:04.000
I'm going to say something and this is a bit controversial

29:04.000 --> 29:06.000
but guess what

29:06.000 --> 29:08.000
Elon Musk announced that Twitter is absolutely

29:08.000 --> 29:10.000
fine with that kind of content

29:10.000 --> 29:12.000
so I'm sorry but one up on Elon Musk

29:12.000 --> 29:14.000
because he couldn't give less of a rat's arse

29:14.000 --> 29:16.000
and to be honest

29:16.000 --> 29:18.000
that's kind of what I'm looking for when it comes to

29:18.000 --> 29:20.000
just making content

29:20.000 --> 29:22.000
we're all adults here we're all doing our thing

29:22.000 --> 29:24.000
like there's no need

29:24.000 --> 29:26.000
for all these things going on

29:26.000 --> 29:28.000
but yeah

29:32.000 --> 29:34.000
so unfortunately

29:34.000 --> 29:36.000
it means I have four missing

29:36.000 --> 29:38.000
oh I shouldn't say those words

29:38.000 --> 29:40.000
sorry four inkable audios

29:40.000 --> 29:42.000
so I need to go

29:42.000 --> 29:44.000
record so

29:44.000 --> 29:46.000
I'm not actually sure what my fourth upload

29:46.000 --> 29:48.000
this month is going to be on Patreon

29:48.000 --> 29:50.000
because

29:52.000 --> 29:54.000
originally it was supposed to be

29:54.000 --> 29:56.000
part one of the series

29:56.000 --> 29:58.000
but it's not possible

30:04.000 --> 30:06.000
but yeah did you like the audio

30:06.000 --> 30:08.000
for those of you who are on Patreon

30:08.000 --> 30:10.000
because it was absolutely outrageous

30:10.000 --> 30:12.000
you can probably monetize Twitter eventually

30:12.000 --> 30:14.000
oh you need five million

30:14.000 --> 30:16.000
impressions I'm not sure we're there

30:16.000 --> 30:18.000
unless like well she

30:18.000 --> 30:20.000
stirs

30:20.000 --> 30:22.000
and Mercy

30:22.000 --> 30:24.000
can't get caught in the algorithm

30:24.000 --> 30:26.000
when

30:26.000 --> 30:28.000
this new meta came up

30:28.000 --> 30:30.000
so they actually probably do

30:30.000 --> 30:32.000
have that

30:32.000 --> 30:34.000
but

30:34.000 --> 30:36.000
yeah like

30:36.000 --> 30:38.000
if Twitter is like yeah this is

30:38.000 --> 30:40.000
four I've burnt all of them

30:40.000 --> 30:42.000
I have five

30:42.000 --> 30:44.000
lobbies out of that that's terrible

30:46.000 --> 30:48.000
that was a really rough run right lobbies

30:48.000 --> 30:50.000
we've got 500 let's see

30:50.000 --> 30:52.000
how much we just absolutely

30:52.000 --> 30:54.000
waste honestly

30:54.000 --> 30:56.000
we'll do

30:58.000 --> 31:00.000
it was very unhinged the ASMR

31:00.000 --> 31:02.000
yeah I thought it was hilarious

31:02.000 --> 31:04.000
I was like freaking jumping around

31:04.000 --> 31:06.000
the mic

31:06.000 --> 31:08.000
I was doing like backflips trying to come over

31:08.000 --> 31:10.000
and like get it louder and stuff

31:10.000 --> 31:12.000
do you know how many I put so many

31:12.000 --> 31:14.000
like noise dampening filters

31:14.000 --> 31:16.000
on the audio as well

31:16.000 --> 31:18.000
but the clap was so loud

31:18.000 --> 31:20.000
it was outrageous

31:20.000 --> 31:22.000
um

31:22.000 --> 31:24.000
I don't know if it'll survive on YouTube

31:24.000 --> 31:26.000
but I'll still upload it as a YOLO anyway

31:26.000 --> 31:28.000
because it's hilarious and I don't care

31:28.000 --> 31:30.000
and to be honest I never really

31:30.000 --> 31:32.000
did anything that outrageous because it's just

31:32.000 --> 31:34.000
sound like to me it's like just

31:34.000 --> 31:36.000
the sound of someone clapping their hands okay

31:36.000 --> 31:38.000
it's just what's actually happening

31:38.000 --> 31:40.000
that's a bit outrageous but because

31:40.000 --> 31:42.000
there's no audio it's fine

31:42.000 --> 31:44.000
so because there's no visual

31:44.000 --> 31:46.000
unhinged isn't a negative thing

31:46.000 --> 31:48.000
Sony the audio is the reason

31:50.000 --> 31:52.000
I'll have to

31:52.000 --> 31:54.000
go stuff to see the 7th grade

31:54.000 --> 31:56.000
yeah basically

31:56.000 --> 31:58.000
I did clapping ASMR

31:58.000 --> 32:00.000
but I didn't use my hands

32:00.000 --> 32:02.000
hmm

32:02.000 --> 32:04.000
I want her

32:04.000 --> 32:06.000
well I'm gonna see if I can get some fish

32:06.000 --> 32:08.000
I don't need any more fish if it's for me

32:08.000 --> 32:10.000
I'm sure you've got 10k swordfish

32:12.000 --> 32:14.000
um but yeah

32:14.000 --> 32:16.000
that's the audio I made

32:16.000 --> 32:18.000
oh my god

32:18.000 --> 32:20.000
we've almost leveled up again

32:20.000 --> 32:22.000
54

32:22.000 --> 32:24.000
that's fantastic

32:24.000 --> 32:26.000
what a genius entrepreneur truly

32:26.000 --> 32:28.000
I've turned

32:28.000 --> 32:30.000
I fell asleep to the begging one

32:30.000 --> 32:32.000
really?

32:32.000 --> 32:34.000
that got so popular

32:34.000 --> 32:36.000
I'm like I definitely hit the algorithm

32:36.000 --> 32:38.000
because

32:38.000 --> 32:40.000
well someone said on one of my

32:40.000 --> 32:42.000
ASMR stream

32:42.000 --> 32:44.000
wait what happened there

32:44.000 --> 32:46.000
someone said on my ASMR stream

32:46.000 --> 32:48.000
that

32:48.000 --> 32:50.000
I was on tiktok feature

32:50.000 --> 32:52.000
page

32:52.000 --> 32:54.000
but Vailer doesn't upload

32:54.000 --> 32:56.000
to tiktok we've reserved everyone's name

32:56.000 --> 32:58.000
on tiktok just in case

32:58.000 --> 33:00.000
but it's more important

33:00.000 --> 33:02.000
to do youtube shorts vs tiktok

33:02.000 --> 33:04.000
like over that kind of thing

33:04.000 --> 33:06.000
um

33:08.000 --> 33:10.000
what liquid you put on your

33:10.000 --> 33:12.000
not hands I heard you spree something at the beginning

33:12.000 --> 33:14.000
oh it's coconut oil

33:16.000 --> 33:18.000
it's oil

33:18.000 --> 33:20.000
in the audio like literally in the audio

33:20.000 --> 33:22.000
you can hear me take off my prel

33:22.000 --> 33:24.000
I left that in on purpose

33:24.000 --> 33:26.000
because I breathed

33:26.000 --> 33:28.000
like heavily through it and I was like

33:28.000 --> 33:30.000
I'll edit this out but then I was like

33:30.000 --> 33:32.000
oh maybe someone would enjoy it

33:32.000 --> 33:34.000
so I just left it in so you can literally

33:34.000 --> 33:36.000
hear me take off my weapon drew

33:36.000 --> 33:38.000
and armour

33:38.000 --> 33:40.000
nudge nudge

33:42.000 --> 33:44.000
tiktok clippers

33:44.000 --> 33:46.000
no like so on tiktok

33:46.000 --> 33:48.000
it's called

33:48.000 --> 33:50.000
a video format is called tiktok

33:50.000 --> 33:52.000
where's youtube it's called the short

33:52.000 --> 33:54.000
and twitch it's a clip

33:54.000 --> 33:56.000
but it's all the same thing

33:56.000 --> 33:58.000
oh I leveled up I got 54

33:58.000 --> 34:00.000
oh my gosh

34:00.000 --> 34:02.000
maybe 70 is gonna be like

34:02.000 --> 34:04.000
way before like at the rate we're

34:04.000 --> 34:06.000
doing these lobbies

34:08.000 --> 34:10.000
um

34:10.000 --> 34:12.000
my beloved

34:12.000 --> 34:14.000
thank you

34:14.000 --> 34:16.000
oh my god that voice crack

34:16.000 --> 34:18.000
70 is fast yeah I feel like maybe

34:18.000 --> 34:20.000
I might have

34:20.000 --> 34:22.000
underestimated how much we're gonna get

34:24.000 --> 34:26.000
the little extra sounds add a lot

34:26.000 --> 34:28.000
oh right so I can actually tell you

34:28.000 --> 34:30.000
the behind the scenes of recording the coconut clapping

34:30.000 --> 34:32.000
let's call it the coconut clapping

34:32.000 --> 34:34.000
that'll be our code word for it

34:34.000 --> 34:36.000
um

34:36.000 --> 34:38.000
the reason why you hear me go

34:38.000 --> 34:40.000
oh and then

34:40.000 --> 34:42.000
I do it is because I had to hold on

34:42.000 --> 34:44.000
to my

34:44.000 --> 34:46.000
my gooblies because they were

34:46.000 --> 34:48.000
bumping

34:48.000 --> 34:50.000
and jumping because of like

34:50.000 --> 34:52.000
in order to make

34:52.000 --> 34:54.000
um your buns of steel

34:54.000 --> 34:56.000
clap you have to like go up and down

34:56.000 --> 34:58.000
quite not violently

34:58.000 --> 35:00.000
but you have to make it quite fast that's something

35:00.000 --> 35:02.000
sometimes I do it slowly and then sometimes

35:02.000 --> 35:04.000
it's like one after

35:04.000 --> 35:06.000
I'd clap that coconut I mean what

35:06.000 --> 35:08.000
the cool thing is

35:08.000 --> 35:10.000
that you can fully unleash the Scottish accent

35:10.000 --> 35:12.000
doesn't mean it tastes like coconut

35:12.000 --> 35:14.000
I mean right now probably

35:14.000 --> 35:16.000
oh I should do that smell trend

35:16.000 --> 35:18.000
I keep forgetting coconut clapping

35:18.000 --> 35:20.000
like 1 to 5 of them

35:20.000 --> 35:22.000
if you cook at a range next door you're burned

35:22.000 --> 35:24.000
I can't be bothered moving though

35:24.000 --> 35:26.000
I want to stay with my reef limbs at the fire

35:26.000 --> 35:28.000
I was gone for 5 just strong

35:28.000 --> 35:30.000
he died no I'm level

35:30.000 --> 35:32.000
54

35:32.000 --> 35:34.000
I just came to realise I've probably

35:34.000 --> 35:36.000
severely underestimated that we're

35:36.000 --> 35:38.000
achieved 70s this stream

35:38.000 --> 35:40.000
we are most likely going to have

35:40.000 --> 35:42.000
a lot more than that

35:42.000 --> 35:44.000
um

35:44.000 --> 35:46.000
aggressively clapping coconut

35:46.000 --> 35:48.000
well at one minute I was like I feel like

35:48.000 --> 35:50.000
um saw

35:50.000 --> 35:52.000
I think I said saw but what I meant was

35:52.000 --> 35:54.000
jaws that shark like that

35:54.000 --> 35:56.000
because I was away I went

35:56.000 --> 35:58.000
walked further away from the microphone

35:58.000 --> 36:00.000
and then came closer and it was like

36:00.000 --> 36:02.000
ding ding ding clap clap

36:02.000 --> 36:04.000
ding ding ding clap clap clap clap clap

36:04.000 --> 36:06.000
it's one of the most

36:06.000 --> 36:08.000
ridiculous audios I've ever made but

36:08.000 --> 36:10.000
I got halfway

36:10.000 --> 36:12.000
through editing my

36:12.000 --> 36:14.000
first

36:14.000 --> 36:16.000
1k thank you

36:16.000 --> 36:18.000
oh wait I've got salmon sugar

36:18.000 --> 36:20.000
I didn't notice that salmon there wait I'll finish

36:20.000 --> 36:22.000
off the salmon

36:22.000 --> 36:24.000
um

36:24.000 --> 36:26.000
I got halfway through

36:26.000 --> 36:28.000
finishing my first like 1000

36:28.000 --> 36:30.000
special ASMR and it's just

36:30.000 --> 36:32.000
me rambling

36:32.000 --> 36:34.000
and doing tingles it honestly

36:34.000 --> 36:36.000
probably feels like a live stream like when I

36:36.000 --> 36:38.000
just start rambling whilst I'm doing tingles

36:38.000 --> 36:40.000
but like I was having so much fun

36:40.000 --> 36:42.000
like um being like

36:42.000 --> 36:44.000
guess what this is oh my god

36:44.000 --> 36:46.000
this is actually a sponge I don't know if you could

36:46.000 --> 36:48.000
guess that type thing like I was just getting

36:48.000 --> 36:50.000
so excited so it doesn't sound

36:50.000 --> 36:52.000
like ASMR again

36:52.000 --> 36:54.000
from the aster

36:54.000 --> 36:56.000
tuber

36:56.000 --> 36:58.000
like 92 is halfway to 99

36:58.000 --> 37:00.000
XP wise okay

37:00.000 --> 37:02.000
oh dear lord

37:02.000 --> 37:04.000
this is going to take a little cheeky while

37:04.000 --> 37:06.000
um hi

37:06.000 --> 37:08.000
hello thank you for joining

37:08.000 --> 37:10.000
don't worry 70 isn't even halfway to 99

37:10.000 --> 37:12.000
hmm

37:12.000 --> 37:14.000
well I wanted to try and finish it in this

37:14.000 --> 37:16.000
month because I had on week

37:16.000 --> 37:18.000
4 I had 2 back to back

37:18.000 --> 37:20.000
runescape and I picked

37:20.000 --> 37:22.000
the movies I'm like 99%

37:22.000 --> 37:24.000
sure we're doing John Wick

37:24.000 --> 37:26.000
all of John Wick

37:26.000 --> 37:28.000
series

37:28.000 --> 37:30.000
um

37:30.000 --> 37:32.000
if I burnt a singular

37:32.000 --> 37:34.000
salmon

37:34.000 --> 37:36.000
we'll do all of

37:36.000 --> 37:38.000
John Wick

37:38.000 --> 37:40.000
month long cooking stream honestly

37:40.000 --> 37:42.000

like you could hear me

37:56.000 --> 37:58.000
do it

37:58.000 --> 38:00.000
oh thank you for the super chat

38:00.000 --> 38:02.000
your boy Stephen Adams

38:02.000 --> 38:04.000

38:08.000 --> 38:10.000
the way she was going to call her fan page

38:10.000 --> 38:12.000
bebelpales was hilarious

38:12.000 --> 38:14.000
I can't remember it wasn't bebelpales

38:14.000 --> 38:16.000
was it? oh no it was pebelpales or something

38:16.000 --> 38:18.000
it was absolutely hilarious

38:18.000 --> 38:20.000
um I remember

38:20.000 --> 38:22.000
being like

38:22.000 --> 38:24.000
she said what out loud when she said

38:24.000 --> 38:26.000
that I was absolutely he ho in

38:26.000 --> 38:28.000
um

38:28.000 --> 38:30.000
but then she couldn't keep the fan name

38:30.000 --> 38:32.000
and I'm like it is probably for the better

38:32.000 --> 38:34.000
people but you're absolutely hilarious

38:34.000 --> 38:36.000
please do not change

38:36.000 --> 38:38.000
um

38:38.000 --> 38:40.000
is this the cause? the worst

38:40.000 --> 38:42.000
the tuber is

38:42.000 --> 38:44.000
for their manager the better

38:44.000 --> 38:46.000
literally

38:46.000 --> 38:48.000
oh well I tell you

38:48.000 --> 38:50.000
I won't tell you

38:50.000 --> 38:52.000
um

38:52.000 --> 38:54.000
but yeah

38:54.000 --> 38:56.000
literally it was hilarious

38:56.000 --> 38:58.000
isn't that what everyone jokes about

38:58.000 --> 39:00.000
pipa they're like oh pipa is such a headache

39:00.000 --> 39:02.000
for her manager

39:02.000 --> 39:04.000
how is self management treating you

39:04.000 --> 39:06.000
delicious I don't have to do anything

39:06.000 --> 39:08.000
literally the girl

39:08.000 --> 39:10.000
as far as I'm aware the girls are happy

39:10.000 --> 39:12.000
they can pick what they want do what they want

39:12.000 --> 39:14.000
unfortunately

39:14.000 --> 39:16.000
because

39:16.000 --> 39:18.000
Azura and Emi

39:18.000 --> 39:20.000
are on a warning

39:20.000 --> 39:22.000
um

39:22.000 --> 39:24.000
by juicy youtube thanks to their

39:24.000 --> 39:26.000
hidden ASMR update guidelines

39:26.000 --> 39:28.000
um

39:28.000 --> 39:30.000
I am does say thank you for the tip

39:30.000 --> 39:32.000
and on this

39:32.000 --> 39:34.000
thank you for your tip

39:34.000 --> 39:36.000
um

39:36.000 --> 39:38.000
oh

39:38.000 --> 39:40.000
unfortunately I've not

39:40.000 --> 39:42.000
I've kind of discouraged them

39:42.000 --> 39:44.000
for doing ASMR until the warning is up

39:44.000 --> 39:46.000
because it's very dangerous

39:46.000 --> 39:48.000
if they get a strike um

39:48.000 --> 39:50.000
I'm like brav

39:50.000 --> 39:52.000
youtube please

39:52.000 --> 39:54.000
I'm back

39:54.000 --> 39:56.000
I got distracted oh don't worry I'm literally here

39:56.000 --> 39:58.000
for 12 hours don't worry

39:58.000 --> 40:00.000
we're doing an endurance today I have had

40:00.000 --> 40:02.000
so many short streams this week

40:02.000 --> 40:04.000
it felt so weird

40:04.000 --> 40:06.000
like I do have a lot

40:06.000 --> 40:08.000
of time to like finally start editing

40:08.000 --> 40:10.000
I have a heck of a lot of vtuber

40:10.000 --> 40:12.000
ASMR collabs coming through

40:12.000 --> 40:14.000
I wrote an ASMR collab

40:14.000 --> 40:16.000
for two the girls would be allure together

40:16.000 --> 40:18.000
um

40:18.000 --> 40:20.000
and

40:20.000 --> 40:22.000
the girls

40:22.000 --> 40:24.000
one of them reacted

40:24.000 --> 40:26.000
and thought the plot was adorable

40:26.000 --> 40:28.000
it's just super basic short plot

40:28.000 --> 40:30.000
I never want to overwhelm the girls

40:30.000 --> 40:32.000
with anything that I assign them

40:32.000 --> 40:34.000
so please don't think it's like some super mega

40:34.000 --> 40:36.000
do do do do do

40:36.000 --> 40:38.000
eh

40:38.000 --> 40:40.000
I know that there is a collab with Mercy

40:40.000 --> 40:42.000
that's both audio and

40:42.000 --> 40:44.000
55

40:44.000 --> 40:46.000
um that's both audio

40:46.000 --> 40:48.000
and we get to play this game tomorrow

40:48.000 --> 40:50.000
um not tomorrow not tomorrow

40:50.000 --> 40:52.000
next week next week

40:52.000 --> 40:54.000
um I am going to play RuneScape

40:54.000 --> 40:56.000
before it because

40:56.000 --> 40:58.000
I am going to stream on

40:58.000 --> 41:00.000
Mercy's time zone like when she

41:00.000 --> 41:02.000
normally streams um

41:02.000 --> 41:04.000
so basically we're gonna play RuneScape

41:04.000 --> 41:06.000
for a solid

41:06.000 --> 41:08.000
chunk and then I'm gonna go offline and

41:08.000 --> 41:10.000
rest my voice for like an hour

41:10.000 --> 41:12.000
or two no probably

41:12.000 --> 41:14.000
two hours because I'll be in voice call

41:14.000 --> 41:16.000
with Mercy one hour before

41:16.000 --> 41:18.000
eh the collab if you didn't know

41:18.000 --> 41:20.000
it is common courtesy for vtuber

41:20.000 --> 41:22.000
to show up one hour before

41:22.000 --> 41:24.000
eh a collab which is where you

41:24.000 --> 41:26.000
do all of your um

41:26.000 --> 41:28.000
technical

41:28.000 --> 41:30.000
failures as I had with

41:30.000 --> 41:32.000
flipping

41:32.000 --> 41:34.000
eh again special shout out to sheebie

41:34.000 --> 41:36.000
for keeping my head on my shoulders

41:36.000 --> 41:38.000
I was panicking when

41:38.000 --> 41:40.000
we could not do up

41:40.000 --> 41:42.000
eh

41:42.000 --> 41:44.000
she's grinding so fast

41:44.000 --> 41:46.000
baby won't you

41:46.000 --> 41:48.000
grind on me

41:48.000 --> 41:50.000
relax your mind

41:50.000 --> 41:52.000
turn your time

41:52.000 --> 41:54.000
with me

41:54.000 --> 41:56.000
that's all I know of that song

41:56.000 --> 41:58.000
I got one cake

41:58.000 --> 42:00.000
carambua

42:00.000 --> 42:02.000
when you start cooking

42:02.000 --> 42:04.000
members first

42:04.000 --> 42:06.000
I have like

42:06.000 --> 42:08.000
10,000 swordfish to go through

42:08.000 --> 42:10.000
I have no idea what even potential

42:10.000 --> 42:12.000
xp that might is

42:12.000 --> 42:14.000
that might is ok well

42:14.000 --> 42:16.000
one you're done what english was that

42:20.000 --> 42:22.000
eh is that a threat or a promise

42:24.000 --> 42:26.000
eh I was gonna

42:26.000 --> 42:28.000
do marshmallows

42:28.000 --> 42:30.000
actually I got such nice

42:30.000 --> 42:32.000
marshmallows you guys need to stop being so nice to me because

42:32.000 --> 42:34.000
if I get emotional

42:34.000 --> 42:36.000
and start reading them I start getting

42:36.000 --> 42:38.000
teary eyed and I'm like I can't handle these

42:38.000 --> 42:40.000
right now because it's gonna like make me cry

42:40.000 --> 42:42.000
like happy tears

42:42.000 --> 42:44.000
so you guys need to stop being so nice to me

42:48.000 --> 42:50.000
there's currently a reflin

42:50.000 --> 42:52.000
ehm

42:52.000 --> 42:54.000
who's keeping me updated about their addiction

42:54.000 --> 42:56.000
right now and they're like

42:56.000 --> 42:58.000
I don't even feel the need to go back to my addiction

42:58.000 --> 43:00.000
I'm like oh my god you're kicking your addiction

43:00.000 --> 43:02.000
I'm like how are you

43:02.000 --> 43:04.000
what how

43:04.000 --> 43:06.000
like that's amazing like I could get

43:06.000 --> 43:08.000
into the nitty-gritty of like how insane

43:08.000 --> 43:10.000
addiction is and look

43:10.000 --> 43:12.000
your brain once it creates

43:12.000 --> 43:14.000
a neural pathway it likes it wants to keep

43:14.000 --> 43:16.000
repeating that it's nice and easy it's why

43:16.000 --> 43:18.000
nostalgia is so powerful because you don't

43:18.000 --> 43:20.000
have to like learn the new lore of something

43:20.000 --> 43:22.000
it sounds silly but

43:22.000 --> 43:24.000
ehm

43:24.000 --> 43:26.000
like it's very easy

43:26.000 --> 43:28.000
to fall into addiction

43:28.000 --> 43:30.000
and especially

43:30.000 --> 43:32.000
your makeup your genetic

43:32.000 --> 43:34.000
makeup can make you predisposition

43:34.000 --> 43:36.000
for it as well it's quite it's quite fascinating

43:36.000 --> 43:38.000
because it's like it's kind of like

43:38.000 --> 43:40.000
gamba like I spoke previously

43:40.000 --> 43:42.000
I had a

43:42.000 --> 43:44.000
advertisement offer

43:44.000 --> 43:46.000
of four thousand US dollars

43:46.000 --> 43:48.000
to insert a 60 second

43:48.000 --> 43:50.000
gamba ad

43:50.000 --> 43:52.000
and I said no because

43:52.000 --> 43:54.000
it's gamba

43:54.000 --> 43:56.000
but it's very interesting

43:56.000 --> 43:58.000
how

43:58.000 --> 44:00.000
severely gamba seems to

44:00.000 --> 44:02.000
affect individuals

44:02.000 --> 44:04.000
now this is just an observation

44:04.000 --> 44:06.000
but whenever I've seen

44:06.000 --> 44:08.000
gamba ads that are like stop when the fund

44:08.000 --> 44:10.000
stops a ten thousand

44:10.000 --> 44:12.000
swordfish should get you to level 78

44:12.000 --> 44:14.000
let's go

44:14.000 --> 44:16.000
oh my god 78 by 9 to the stream

44:16.000 --> 44:18.000
ehm

44:18.000 --> 44:20.000
whenever you see a gamba ad that's like don't

44:20.000 --> 44:22.000
is like stop stop when the fund stops

44:22.000 --> 44:24.000
they always show a guy

44:24.000 --> 44:26.000
and I'm wondering

44:26.000 --> 44:28.000
ehm

44:28.000 --> 44:30.000
is the predisp... not the pre

44:30.000 --> 44:32.000
the socialization

44:32.000 --> 44:34.000
because obviously if we're being

44:34.000 --> 44:36.000
very stereotypical of society

44:36.000 --> 44:38.000
we live in a society

44:38.000 --> 44:40.000
guys are normally more interested in sports

44:40.000 --> 44:42.000
and is the

44:42.000 --> 44:44.000
environment around it that it's normal

44:44.000 --> 44:46.000
to gamble

44:46.000 --> 44:48.000
and kind of like put a cheeky

44:48.000 --> 44:50.000
10 or here on this

44:50.000 --> 44:52.000
bet a 20

44:52.000 --> 44:54.000
quid here on this bet type thing

44:54.000 --> 44:56.000
before it snowballs out of control

44:56.000 --> 44:58.000
it's quite

44:58.000 --> 45:00.000
fascinating I actually had someone

45:00.000 --> 45:02.000
in real life I knew

45:02.000 --> 45:04.000
that

45:04.000 --> 45:06.000
they weren't a family member but

45:06.000 --> 45:08.000
they were like an acquaintance and I learned

45:08.000 --> 45:10.000
of their story

45:10.000 --> 45:12.000
and basically

45:12.000 --> 45:14.000
the guy gambled away their mortgage

45:14.000 --> 45:16.000
and

45:16.000 --> 45:18.000
it's just

45:18.000 --> 45:20.000
it's such a shame what kind of grip

45:20.000 --> 45:22.000
it has

45:22.000 --> 45:24.000
on certain people because for me

45:24.000 --> 45:26.000
right now I

45:26.000 --> 45:28.000
I am

45:28.000 --> 45:30.000
I'm like confident that I don't have

45:30.000 --> 45:32.000
that kind of addiction

45:32.000 --> 45:34.000
I

45:34.000 --> 45:36.000
it doesn't appeal to me

45:36.000 --> 45:38.000
I would walk away

45:38.000 --> 45:40.000
like angry that I wasted

45:40.000 --> 45:42.000
my money type thing like my brain

45:42.000 --> 45:44.000
doesn't go oh

45:44.000 --> 45:46.000
if I gamble again I'll make back

45:46.000 --> 45:48.000
what I lost like no my brain's like

45:48.000 --> 45:50.000
I'll waste the time that was I'd rather play

45:50.000 --> 45:52.000
like a video game or something else like that

45:52.000 --> 45:54.000
you know

45:54.000 --> 45:56.000
I wish I could join you but not on RuneScape

45:56.000 --> 45:58.000
wait what's wrong with RuneScape

45:58.000 --> 46:00.000
it's old school

46:00.000 --> 46:02.000
look these are all Reeflings we're all just hanging

46:02.000 --> 46:04.000
out outside the we're all hanging

46:04.000 --> 46:06.000
out in Edgeville for no particular

46:06.000 --> 46:08.000
reason

46:08.000 --> 46:10.000
um

46:10.000 --> 46:12.000
yeah sorry I don't know if

46:12.000 --> 46:14.000
I need to turn down the

46:14.000 --> 46:16.000
that sound

46:16.000 --> 46:18.000
effect

46:18.000 --> 46:20.000
I'll turn down the sound effect just because

46:20.000 --> 46:22.000
it's very repetitive

46:22.000 --> 46:24.000
but hopefully you can still

46:24.000 --> 46:26.000
hear it but

46:26.000 --> 46:28.000
sorry

46:28.000 --> 46:30.000
we're in Edgeville together where you can do better

46:30.000 --> 46:32.000
90% of gamblers quit

46:32.000 --> 46:34.000
before they've been big now I have seen those

46:34.000 --> 46:36.000
memes I have to admit they're a wee bit funny

46:36.000 --> 46:38.000
but it is

46:38.000 --> 46:40.000
just a very curious

46:42.000 --> 46:44.000
predicament that people seem to get themselves into

46:44.000 --> 46:46.000
I mean that's kind of what

46:46.000 --> 46:48.000
kick the website kick.com

46:48.000 --> 46:50.000
if you heard about it

46:50.000 --> 46:52.000
the only

46:52.000 --> 46:54.000
reason they are able to be fueled

46:54.000 --> 46:56.000
so high is because of

46:56.000 --> 46:58.000
Gamble

46:58.000 --> 47:00.000
there's no other

47:00.000 --> 47:02.000
reason and it's perfectly

47:02.000 --> 47:04.000
fine to say that

47:06.000 --> 47:08.000
but it just kind of goes to show

47:08.000 --> 47:10.000
you how big the house always

47:10.000 --> 47:12.000
wins if they can offer this business

47:12.000 --> 47:14.000
model on the side

47:14.000 --> 47:16.000
I don't know if you guys remember

47:16.000 --> 47:18.000
when Twitch officially announced

47:18.000 --> 47:20.000
it's like banning Gamble

47:22.000 --> 47:24.000
it's just very curious

47:24.000 --> 47:26.000
because

47:26.000 --> 47:28.000
there's a lot of

47:28.000 --> 47:30.000
discussion you can get into and you can say

47:30.000 --> 47:32.000
well the person that's Gamble

47:32.000 --> 47:34.000
and it's their money

47:34.000 --> 47:36.000
it's their life

47:36.000 --> 47:38.000
it's their choice

47:38.000 --> 47:40.000
but if like

47:40.000 --> 47:42.000
I'm trying to think

47:42.000 --> 47:44.000
and do two things at once and it's not coming out in a sense

47:44.000 --> 47:46.000
so

47:48.000 --> 47:50.000
is it the

47:50.000 --> 47:52.000
hold on let me put my sense together

47:54.000 --> 47:56.000
when is it not a choice

47:56.000 --> 47:58.000
when is it not a choice is the question

47:58.000 --> 48:00.000
why is it it's addiction

48:00.000 --> 48:02.000
and not a choice when it comes to

48:02.000 --> 48:04.000
Gamble but it might be

48:04.000 --> 48:06.000
a choice when it comes to other bad actions

48:06.000 --> 48:08.000
you might do in your life

48:08.000 --> 48:10.000
why is Gamble marked out for one

48:10.000 --> 48:12.000
why is alcoholism marked out for one

48:12.000 --> 48:14.000
obviously when it comes to alcoholism

48:14.000 --> 48:16.000
your body does change the tolerance

48:16.000 --> 48:18.000
but you could argue the same for Gamble

48:18.000 --> 48:20.000
because your brain literally

48:20.000 --> 48:22.000
lights up like fireworks

48:22.000 --> 48:24.000
when you win

48:24.000 --> 48:26.000
and it's just very

48:26.000 --> 48:28.000
interesting because where's the line

48:28.000 --> 48:30.000
drawn from someone is consenting

48:30.000 --> 48:32.000
to do this activity and someone

48:32.000 --> 48:34.000
isn't able to consent to do this activity

48:34.000 --> 48:36.000
because it's causing harm

48:36.000 --> 48:38.000
you could argue sitting on runescape

48:38.000 --> 48:40.000
for 12 hours well that's causing harm

48:40.000 --> 48:42.000
oh well

48:42.000 --> 48:44.000
we'll need to take her offline

48:44.000 --> 48:46.000
because she's not well because she's doing this

48:46.000 --> 48:48.000
for 12 hours because that's bad

48:48.000 --> 48:50.000
for her health sitting for 12 hours

48:50.000 --> 48:52.000
type thing you know

48:52.000 --> 48:54.000
do you know what I'm trying to say out loud

48:54.000 --> 48:56.000
I struggle to say the words

48:56.000 --> 48:58.000
thank you for coming

48:58.000 --> 49:00.000
I'm a member tier

49:00.000 --> 49:02.000
destructive behaviours that have historically

49:02.000 --> 49:04.000
been deemed as vices that's where it is

49:04.000 --> 49:06.000
yeah like

49:06.000 --> 49:08.000
we're being called out literally all runescapers

49:08.000 --> 49:10.000
getting called out from across the line

49:10.000 --> 49:12.000
wow we're about to level up again

49:12.000 --> 49:14.000
oh my god just let me do

49:14.000 --> 49:16.000
one ramble and we're going to be

49:16.000 --> 49:18.000
99 overnight like just

49:18.000 --> 49:20.000
give me one subject to ramble about

49:20.000 --> 49:22.000
and we're done there is a logout

49:22.000 --> 49:24.000
timer after 6 hours I will

49:24.000 --> 49:26.000
most likely log me out when I go for the big job

49:26.000 --> 49:28.000
but I don't need one right now

49:30.000 --> 49:32.000
but yeah

49:32.000 --> 49:34.000
in college maxing on runescapers did it

49:34.000 --> 49:36.000
on homework real

49:36.000 --> 49:38.000
the lines do get but well that's

49:38.000 --> 49:40.000
it's the interesting thing it's like when

49:40.000 --> 49:42.000
where do laws come into place to protect

49:42.000 --> 49:44.000
gamble

49:44.000 --> 49:46.000
gamblers sorry

49:46.000 --> 49:48.000
because when you lose

49:48.000 --> 49:50.000
your money you're told tough

49:50.000 --> 49:52.000
tough bananas

49:52.000 --> 49:54.000
yay 56

49:54.000 --> 49:56.000
yatta

49:56.000 --> 49:58.000
when you lose all your money you're told

49:58.000 --> 50:00.000
tough bananas

50:00.000 --> 50:02.000
when you lose your money to scam

50:02.000 --> 50:04.000
the bank says see tough bananas

50:04.000 --> 50:06.000
but yeah there's laws in place

50:06.000 --> 50:08.000
to protect you in quotation marks

50:08.000 --> 50:10.000
and to get the

50:10.000 --> 50:12.000
scammers put in jail to get

50:12.000 --> 50:14.000
well you can't really put

50:14.000 --> 50:16.000
casinos in jail so that doesn't work

50:16.000 --> 50:18.000
that's a terrible

50:18.000 --> 50:20.000
comparison

50:24.000 --> 50:26.000
hmm

50:26.000 --> 50:28.000
well I've kind of shot myself in that

50:28.000 --> 50:30.000
line of thought I've completely undone

50:30.000 --> 50:32.000
that line of thought there I do apologize

50:32.000 --> 50:34.000
um

50:34.000 --> 50:36.000
there's really

50:36.000 --> 50:38.000
no good answer no there isn't

50:38.000 --> 50:40.000
that's the thing

50:40.000 --> 50:42.000
that's the thing that's the thing I want to

50:42.000 --> 50:44.000
highlight there is

50:44.000 --> 50:46.000
no answer and yet

50:46.000 --> 50:48.000
we still have some laws such as

50:48.000 --> 50:50.000
you know obviously twitch isn't

50:50.000 --> 50:52.000
law but twitch is a reflection

50:52.000 --> 50:54.000
of the community views

50:54.000 --> 50:56.000
or the views of the masses

50:56.000 --> 50:58.000
now do you remember

50:58.000 --> 51:00.000
when a

51:00.000 --> 51:02.000
pokemon was like yeah gamma bad

51:02.000 --> 51:04.000
and then all of a sudden twitter blew up

51:04.000 --> 51:06.000
and then twitter was like

51:06.000 --> 51:08.000
gamma bad and then twitch was like

51:08.000 --> 51:10.000
okay now we'll remove

51:10.000 --> 51:12.000
gamma like

51:12.000 --> 51:14.000
that is a perfect

51:14.000 --> 51:16.000
example of

51:16.000 --> 51:18.000
the most basic movement

51:18.000 --> 51:20.000
now don't get me wrong movement isn't world changing

51:20.000 --> 51:22.000
but it is the basic example

51:22.000 --> 51:24.000
of someone who definitely

51:24.000 --> 51:26.000
is on a larger platform

51:26.000 --> 51:28.000
going hey this thing

51:28.000 --> 51:30.000
bad and then everyone going

51:30.000 --> 51:32.000
wait a minute yes

51:32.000 --> 51:34.000
this thing is bad

51:34.000 --> 51:36.000
and then boom

51:36.000 --> 51:38.000
twitch

51:38.000 --> 51:40.000
got rid of the category

51:40.000 --> 51:42.000
and outlawed it and said no bad

51:42.000 --> 51:44.000
now that is

51:44.000 --> 51:46.000
and just

51:46.000 --> 51:48.000
a bloody perfect example

51:48.000 --> 51:50.000
of how

51:50.000 --> 51:52.000
the community

51:52.000 --> 51:54.000
the community

51:54.000 --> 51:56.000
in specific areas and pockets

51:56.000 --> 51:58.000
do have a voice

51:58.000 --> 52:00.000
and do have a say

52:00.000 --> 52:02.000
as much as you might not think on an individual level

52:02.000 --> 52:04.000
you don't have a voice

52:04.000 --> 52:06.000
it might be true but have you ever seen

52:06.000 --> 52:08.000
planet of the apes

52:08.000 --> 52:10.000
monkey on own

52:10.000 --> 52:12.000
weak

52:12.000 --> 52:14.000
monkey together strong

52:14.000 --> 52:16.000
it is true

52:16.000 --> 52:18.000
you can't even deny it there's so many examples

52:18.000 --> 52:20.000
of this

52:20.000 --> 52:22.000
like think of revolutions

52:22.000 --> 52:24.000
such as the french revolution

52:24.000 --> 52:26.000
one individual would get their head

52:26.000 --> 52:28.000
guillotined ok

52:28.000 --> 52:30.000
I'm not being funny I'm being so

52:30.000 --> 52:32.000
true this is my rabbit hole

52:32.000 --> 52:34.000
but like literally the french

52:34.000 --> 52:36.000
revolution one person stands up

52:36.000 --> 52:38.000
and gets their head chopped off right

52:38.000 --> 52:40.000
no revolution no movement

52:40.000 --> 52:42.000
community is not you know

52:42.000 --> 52:44.000
community is not going to rise up

52:44.000 --> 52:46.000
but hold on a minute the people are revolting

52:46.000 --> 52:48.000
the people

52:48.000 --> 52:50.000
are revolting the masses are outraged

52:50.000 --> 52:52.000
how can society continue

52:52.000 --> 52:54.000
if everyone bands together

52:54.000 --> 52:56.000
and

52:56.000 --> 52:58.000
historically every 400 years

52:58.000 --> 53:00.000
society

53:00.000 --> 53:02.000
shifts and what do I mean by

53:02.000 --> 53:04.000
society shifts something new

53:04.000 --> 53:06.000
comes up for society to be

53:06.000 --> 53:08.000
a part of ok

53:08.000 --> 53:10.000
so before capitalism

53:10.000 --> 53:12.000
which is when global

53:12.000 --> 53:14.000
economics became a thing ok

53:14.000 --> 53:16.000
like kinda the industrial revolution

53:16.000 --> 53:18.000
global economics there was

53:18.000 --> 53:20.000
region locked capitalism

53:20.000 --> 53:22.000
ok and it's called feudalism

53:22.000 --> 53:24.000
or something like that it's like

53:24.000 --> 53:26.000
it's not feudalism it's like feudalism

53:26.000 --> 53:28.000
ok

53:28.000 --> 53:30.000
which was when

53:30.000 --> 53:32.000
lords owned

53:32.000 --> 53:34.000
the plots of land and permitted

53:34.000 --> 53:36.000
peasants to generate food

53:36.000 --> 53:38.000
on those lands ok

53:38.000 --> 53:40.000
that was region locked capitalism

53:40.000 --> 53:42.000
before we know capitalism today ok

53:42.000 --> 53:44.000
but that got outdated when

53:44.000 --> 53:46.000
the revolution came in

53:46.000 --> 53:48.000
because you know

53:48.000 --> 53:50.000
people learn fast to

53:50.000 --> 53:52.000
grow certain crops and if you breed

53:52.000 --> 53:54.000
crops I can't remember who did the crop breeding

53:54.000 --> 53:56.000
what's his name

53:56.000 --> 53:58.000
ah sugar I

53:58.000 --> 54:00.000
forgotten feudalism

54:00.000 --> 54:02.000
is with lords yes yes

54:02.000 --> 54:04.000
the chickens are revolting

54:04.000 --> 54:06.000
finally we agree on something

54:06.000 --> 54:08.000
bro it's not 400 years it's like a decade

54:08.000 --> 54:10.000
stuff changes all the time

54:10.000 --> 54:12.000
but like another massive example

54:12.000 --> 54:14.000
shift in society and you're not gonna like

54:14.000 --> 54:16.000
some of yous are not gonna like this but

54:16.000 --> 54:18.000
you're in for a rambling stream

54:18.000 --> 54:20.000
you know you've got me for 12 hours as if

54:20.000 --> 54:22.000
I'm not gonna get on my high horse and teach you history ok

54:22.000 --> 54:24.000
if you

54:24.000 --> 54:26.000
did not know

54:26.000 --> 54:28.000
in Christianity

54:28.000 --> 54:30.000
there's the old testament

54:30.000 --> 54:32.000
and there's the new testament

54:32.000 --> 54:34.000
the new testament

54:34.000 --> 54:36.000
is was created

54:36.000 --> 54:38.000
I believe in

54:38.000 --> 54:40.000
roughly the 15th century

54:40.000 --> 54:42.000
the church got together and went

54:42.000 --> 54:44.000
look the old testament

54:44.000 --> 54:46.000
isn't doing it for the masses

54:46.000 --> 54:48.000
people are starting to question that

54:48.000 --> 54:50.000
because people are becoming aware

54:50.000 --> 54:52.000
that you know

54:52.000 --> 54:54.000
some things aren't working out in the

54:54.000 --> 54:56.000
story

54:56.000 --> 54:58.000
and basically the new testament

54:58.000 --> 55:00.000
is just

55:00.000 --> 55:02.000
friggin made up

55:02.000 --> 55:04.000
1500

55:04.000 --> 55:06.000
years later after

55:06.000 --> 55:08.000
Jebus the source supposedly

55:08.000 --> 55:10.000
passed away

55:10.000 --> 55:12.000
you're so right Strony let's eat the rich

55:12.000 --> 55:14.000
yes! fun blue thank you for the two

55:16.000 --> 55:18.000
like some people can't conceptualize

55:18.000 --> 55:20.000
the difference between a million and a billion

55:20.000 --> 55:22.000
dollars

55:22.000 --> 55:24.000
now take that million and add one

55:24.000 --> 55:26.000
and then add one and then add one

55:26.000 --> 55:28.000
and then add one and keep going and keep going

55:28.000 --> 55:30.000
and keep going and keep going

55:30.000 --> 55:32.000
anyway

55:32.000 --> 55:34.000
casually red fill in the masses

55:34.000 --> 55:36.000
I'm not kidding I will keep mentioning

55:36.000 --> 55:38.000
in the game

55:38.000 --> 55:40.000
needy streamer overload I cannot even believe

55:40.000 --> 55:42.000
they put that in the game that kind of thing

55:42.000 --> 55:44.000
okay

55:44.000 --> 55:46.000
but anyway

55:46.000 --> 55:48.000
anyway that's just me

55:48.000 --> 55:50.000
I don't know what you guys are thinking

55:50.000 --> 55:52.000
but that's just me

55:52.000 --> 55:54.000
but I could really get on my high horse

55:54.000 --> 55:56.000
I should actually I want to do an education stream

55:56.000 --> 55:58.000
about feudalism because

55:58.000 --> 56:00.000
and like kind of

56:00.000 --> 56:02.000
how history and how society used to work

56:02.000 --> 56:04.000
because bargaining used to be how it was

56:04.000 --> 56:06.000
done! bargaining used to be like

56:06.000 --> 56:08.000
hey I have

56:08.000 --> 56:10.000
two weeks would you

56:10.000 --> 56:12.000
trade me one potato for two weeks

56:12.000 --> 56:14.000
that's how it used to be done

56:14.000 --> 56:16.000
that's how there was value in things

56:16.000 --> 56:18.000
that's how humans did it

56:18.000 --> 56:20.000
and and freaking

56:20.000 --> 56:22.000
there are

56:22.000 --> 56:24.000
there are some examples today

56:24.000 --> 56:26.000
of it kind of thriving

56:26.000 --> 56:28.000
and

56:28.000 --> 56:30.000
so runescape is historically

56:30.000 --> 56:32.000
accurate yes! you guys

56:32.000 --> 56:34.000
trading me right now

56:34.000 --> 56:36.000
you are calling upon your ancestors

56:36.000 --> 56:38.000
to give me the resources that you don't

56:38.000 --> 56:40.000
need in the moment you are looking

56:40.000 --> 56:42.000
after me and in return

56:42.000 --> 56:44.000
I will scratch your back later

56:44.000 --> 56:46.000
it's literally why I'm such a big believer

56:46.000 --> 56:48.000
and you scratch my back I scratch yours

56:48.000 --> 56:50.000
because that's how it used to be

56:50.000 --> 56:52.000
return to monkey

56:52.000 --> 56:54.000
replays return to monkey

56:54.000 --> 56:56.000
we were so nice

56:56.000 --> 56:58.000
we had some communities

56:58.000 --> 57:00.000
we had said it's a belonging

57:00.000 --> 57:02.000
it's so nice

57:02.000 --> 57:04.000
the old test schools

57:04.000 --> 57:06.000
oh right okay you're done

57:06.000 --> 57:08.000
out of curiosity

57:08.000 --> 57:10.000
I've not touched old school runescape

57:10.000 --> 57:12.000

57:12.000 --> 57:14.000

57:14.000 --> 57:16.000
a plugin called runelight

57:16.000 --> 57:18.000
you can see it up here this plugin

57:18.000 --> 57:20.000
can track your things

57:20.000 --> 57:22.000
there are good bad examples of this

57:22.000 --> 57:24.000
one stick is weak

57:24.000 --> 57:26.000
many together are strong

57:26.000 --> 57:28.000

how many languages you know only

01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:18.000
English and technically

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:20.000
Scots is a recognized language

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:22.000
but I am

01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:24.000
a Scottish

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:30.000
oh that was another funny image

01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:32.000
aww but I couldn't say that

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:34.000
when I was playing Assassin's Creed

01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:36.000
Brotherhood someone did a

01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:38.000
text post and it was like

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:40.000

01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:42.000

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:44.000
mumbling assassin comes my way

01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:46.000
it keeps me in my balls, keeps rambling

01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:48.000
walks away or something

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:50.000
but I couldn't save it

01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:52.000
I want to save it because it's a funny meme

01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:54.000
I like saving the memes that you guys make

01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:56.000
because it makes me so happy

01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:58.000
why do I keep clicking that one

01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:00.000
oh my cat's outside

01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:02.000
Gimli you're not coming in the day

01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:04.000
that was ridiculous yesterday

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:06.000
I shouldn't have let her in

01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:08.000
because now she thinks she can come in

01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:10.000
all the time and I'm like Gimli no

01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:12.000
we can't come in so she's just going to have to

01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:14.000
save my door until she gets the message

01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:16.000
I'm sorry Gimli

01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:18.000
I'm sorry

01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:20.000
the last time she played Stardew

01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:22.000
she went karaoke for 5 hours

01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:24.000
she has endurance over her mummy

01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:26.000
literally she was on for like 8 hours

01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:28.000
the last time I checked I don't know when she went off

01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:30.000
um

01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:32.000
do you have plans to get membership

01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:34.000
oh I already have membership

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:36.000
I'm just playing on free to play so I can hang

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:38.000
up all the reflins like check us out

01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:40.000

01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:42.000
we're all just hanging

01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:44.000
we're all cooking

01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:46.000
wait you guys aren't cooking

01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:50.000
oh you're putting more logs on the fire

01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:54.000
but I'm cooking

01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:56.000
oh thank you

01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:58.000

cabbage patch head is doing something

01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:02.000
I don't know

01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:04.000
oh we've got just an echo

01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:08.000
we're linking the fire

01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:10.000
oh I understand

01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:12.000
but yeah all the reflins

01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:14.000
I didn't want to alienate anyone

01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:16.000
if they can't do members at the moment

01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:18.000
and we're not cooking

01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:20.000
wait a minute

01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:22.000
wait a minute

01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:24.000
we're not cooking

01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:28.000
any membership items yet

01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:30.000
so we don't need to go in a membership world

01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:32.000
a lot of reflings gifted me

01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:34.000
a ton of fish

01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:36.000
so I'm just powering through that now

01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:38.000
and

01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:40.000
another reflin

01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:42.000
gave me 10,000 friggin sword fish

01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:44.000
I don't know how long it's going to take to get through that

01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:46.000
I don't know if that might actually take us

01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:48.000
to the end of the

01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:50.000
stream

01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:52.000
10,000 fish

01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:54.000
since a lot

01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:56.000
you betrayed Gimli I know

01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:58.000
you don't know French

01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:00.000
I've been lied to

01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:02.000
oh sorry Miser

01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:04.000
I can't

01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:06.000
I can't do it

01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:08.000
I can humorously do

01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:10.000
what are you doing today

01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:12.000
what are you doing

01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:14.000
what are you doing

01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:16.000
I can do French

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:18.000
Scottish

01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:20.000
just to mess with you

01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:22.000
but the actual French

01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:24.000
speaking

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:26.000
like

01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:30.000
I'm trying to think of a sense

01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:32.000
to say

01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:34.000
Montichons

01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:36.000
Machichons

01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:38.000
I think is French for my

01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:40.000
Yiddies

01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:42.000
oh my brain

01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:44.000
my brain can't parley the French right now

01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:46.000
it's too hard

01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:48.000
my roommate that showed me

01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:50.000
your content just DM'd me that

01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:52.000
because of that super chat

01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:54.000
they're like I know

01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:56.000

01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:58.000
oh Gimli

01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:00.000
I can't have you in the room

01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:02.000
she's just gonna

01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:04.000
go back to sleep

01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:06.000
I was playing with my

01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:08.000
cats before a live stream

01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:10.000
to tire them out

01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:12.000
but I couldn't play with her too long

01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:14.000
so she's currently going nuts right now

01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:16.000
but she'll go down for a sleep because she wasn't sleeping

01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:18.000
when I was sleeping so she'll

01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:20.000
don't worry, don't worry about my pooders

01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:22.000
and whenever I go make a tea in that

01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:24.000
I'll go give her some attention

01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:26.000
baby boy is really independent

01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:28.000
though he's like not

01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:30.000
caring I don't know if it's because he's half

01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:32.000
a munchkin that he's more

01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:34.000
tired than the usual cat

01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:36.000
you can get depending on the breed of your cat

01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:38.000
it can be really tired in general

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:40.000
and need like more sleep

01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:42.000
I'm pretty sure there's a type

01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:44.000
of dog that's known for sleeping

01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:46.000
oh wait it's Greyhounds

01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:48.000
Greyhounds are like the laziest

01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:50.000
dog ever but they can do like

01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:52.000
one burst sprint type thing

01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:56.000
21 million

01:05:56.000 --> 01:05:58.000
literally I got sugar daddy

01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:00.000
out the wazoo because of reeflings

01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:02.000
they were throwing them coins

01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:04.000
to me I was like I'm not gonna say

01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:06.000
no this is gonna fund the

01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:08.000
I don't know if we're doing wine

01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:10.000
I don't know if wine is the fastest

01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:12.000
level up once I've

01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:14.000
like cooked everything

01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:16.000
if I push it I can finish

01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:18.000
my first save file in November

01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:20.000
oh I haven't even finished a save file

01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:22.000
I was considering doing some eating runs

01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:24.000
just to show you guys what

01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:26.000
the binding of Isaac

01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:28.000
is all about

01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:30.000
who needs a bot farm

01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:32.000
when you have a cult giving you everything

01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:34.000
you need literally though

01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:38.000
when I had a Saint Bernard

01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:40.000
it felt like it slept for 20 hours a day

01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:42.000
yeah like depending on the breed

01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:44.000
but she's just moody

01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:46.000
I fed her and I played with her

01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:48.000
mouse but

01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:50.000
the problem is because I let her

01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:52.000
in yesterday

01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:54.000
she now thinks she can come in whenever she wants

01:06:56.000 --> 01:06:58.000
you're a bit of a diva

01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:00.000
Gimli you're a bit of a diva

01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:02.000
I have to admit

01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:04.000
but I love her

01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:06.000
I love her

01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:08.000
you're always cooking

01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:10.000
oh I ain't just cooking a runescape

01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:14.000
I can't

01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:16.000
tomorrow's crash bandicoot

01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:20.000
yes

01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:22.000
I think

01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:24.000
July streams

01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:26.000
I'm gonna focus on Xbox games

01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:28.000
to get my gamer score up

01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:30.000
I've done

01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:32.000
decent progress on my goal

01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:34.000
of collabing with 100 vtubers

01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:36.000
with a 3d old thing

01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:38.000
like 3 ASMR collabs

01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:40.000
I have absolutely no issue

01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:42.000
with actually collabing on stream

01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:44.000
yeah good luck with that

01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:46.000
I'm too shy

01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:48.000
I've made great progress

01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:50.000
I think I'm just shy of

01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:52.000
6 ASMR collabs

01:07:56.000 --> 01:07:58.000
and then I need to reach out

01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:00.000
and do

01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:06.000
I want to make all of my goals

01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:08.000
happen before the one year mark

01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:10.000
which means I have to work hard now

01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:12.000
and

01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:14.000
so

01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:16.000
and

01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:18.000
we've got membership coming up as well

01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:20.000
because we've got a lot of lost time

01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:22.000
to make up for but I hope

01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:24.000
you can see with my efforts

01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:26.000
and all my hard work there

01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:28.000
I'm making up for lost time

01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:30.000
it's going good

01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:32.000
I want content out the wazoo

01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:34.000
I want it to be

01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:36.000
good funny times

01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:38.000
literally uploaded that meme ASMR

01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:40.000
please let me hold it

01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:42.000
any plans for halo?

01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:44.000
yes I would love if I could actually

01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:46.000
do

01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:48.000
a vtuber collab on halo

01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:50.000
but I don't know

01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:52.000
anyone who's played halo

01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:54.000
I will ask the vlo girls

01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:56.000
first before I ask around

01:08:56.000 --> 01:08:58.000
and see if anyone's played halo

01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:02.000
not that you need to be

01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:04.000
good at halo

01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:06.000
to play it like you need to know about it

01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:08.000
but I'd rather

01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:10.000
I think if you're playing a nostalgic game

01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:12.000
I'd rather like two people who are

01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:14.000
familiar with it play

01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:16.000
I know that sounds really rude I hope it doesn't come across as rude

01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:18.000
but I mean

01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:20.000
I'm sure there's another halo vtuber

01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:22.000
that's freaking good

01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:24.000
random question are you playing any drg streams?

01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:26.000
what?

01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:28.000
drg?

01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:30.000
what's drg?

01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:32.000
sorry you're gonna have to spell it out for me my brain is very slow

01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:34.000
I

01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:36.000
you'll like to

01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:38.000
check

01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:40.000
who?

01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:42.000
yes I think I can play with you guys

01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:46.000
just as a word

01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:48.000
or a word of warning

01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:50.000
it's not a word of warning

01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:52.000
ac snow paws is live with

01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:54.000
space channel 5

01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:56.000
part 2

01:09:56.000 --> 01:09:58.000
and imibizu is live

01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:00.000
with the coffin of andy and leily

01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:02.000
and she's doing an endurance stream

01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:04.000
I'm so proud

01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:06.000
as my cat is currently kicking down the door

01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:08.000
oh my god

01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:10.000
she's getting that really frustrated

01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:12.000
um

01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:14.000
but yes

01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:16.000
I think

01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:18.000
I can play deep rock galactica

01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:20.000
with you guys and it's not an issue

01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:22.000
at all

01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:24.000
she's trying to do the good ending

01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:26.000
sorry there's only one ending and andy and leily

01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:28.000
and I will not be taking any comments

01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:30.000
I don't even

01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:32.000
I'm

01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:34.000
there's only one true ending

01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:36.000
and I won't have it

01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:38.000
any other way

01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:40.000
me trying to hold in her

01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:42.000
oh god the peeler

01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:44.000
we literally can't outrun them

01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:46.000
that gartic phone stream was so fun though

01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:48.000
the girls are so funny

01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:50.000
um

01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:52.000
but yeah

01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:54.000
the

01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:56.000
already leveled up again

01:10:56.000 --> 01:10:58.000
literally I am rambling through these levels

01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:00.000
like nothing on earth

01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:02.000
like I wake up on the other side of the ramble

01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:04.000
and we're literally 58

01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:06.000
that's fantastic

01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:08.000
oh my goodness

01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:10.000
all these lobbies

01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:12.000
I'm burning them a wee bit but it's fine okay

01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:14.000
you and emmy agree hard on that

01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:16.000
ending yeah

01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:18.000
literally I'm sorry but why on earth would you make

01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:20.000
why would you

01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:22.000
why would you play the game and be like

01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:24.000
uh I'm not gonna do that ending

01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:26.000
no the whole point is to like

01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:28.000
be fine with human curiosity

01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:30.000
like as long as you don't produce any offspring

01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:32.000
no one gives a rat

01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:34.000
anyone geyser

01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:36.000
honestly

01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:40.000
hmm

01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:42.000
halo would be a fun way to do community games

01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:44.000
uh like the halo molly player

01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:46.000
I never actually played much of it

01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:48.000
I heard

01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:50.000
the bat

01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:52.000
was it a halo battle pass came out

01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:54.000
and it was just an absolute shambles

01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:56.000
like it was just a terrible multiplayer

01:11:56.000 --> 01:11:58.000
launch

01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:00.000
and then they did battle pass

01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:02.000
and then it just became

01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:04.000
like this terrible

01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:06.000
thing I don't know

01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:08.000
what ending the one

01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:10.000
true ending

01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:12.000
oh actually I was

01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:14.000
lurking quite a lot someone was like

01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:16.000
wait I don't get it are we emmy's brother

01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:18.000
the reason why you can see

01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:20.000
emmy at all times when she

01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:22.000
streams is because you're her dead brother

01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:24.000
watching over her

01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:26.000
I will spell it out for you

01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:28.000
you are her

01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:30.000
dead brother watching over her

01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:32.000
which is why you can see her stream

01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:34.000
which is why you can see her thoughts on twitter

01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:36.000
okay

01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:38.000
I'll spell it out for you

01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:42.000
the pin pals I don't get it

01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:44.000
hold on hydration guys

01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:46.000
hydration please hydrate

01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:48.000
hmm

01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:50.000
very important

01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:52.000
hmm

01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:54.000
oh actually

01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:56.000

01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:26.000
of the income generated

01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:28.000
dealer do not take a cut

01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:30.000
and the girls can attest to that

01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:32.000
we don't have anything to do with it

01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:34.000
and it completely

01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:36.000
and wholeheartedly supports them

01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:38.000
if you wanted to

01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:40.000
collect all the key chains of the girls

01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:42.000
that could be something very sweet and cute

01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:44.000
I'm gonna make an ASMR of me tapping it

01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:46.000
with my little fake mermaid nails that I

01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:48.000
showed on my hand cam stream

01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:50.000
um

01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:52.000
uh but yeah

01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:54.000
she be love yeah she be

01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:56.000
oh she's basically a lean

01:14:56.000 --> 01:14:58.000
I'm so

01:14:58.000 --> 01:15:00.000
glad that the girls can see their hard

01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:02.000
effort like pay off right away

01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:04.000
um they've been nothing

01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:06.000
but fantastic they really have

01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:08.000
um is the

01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:10.000
merch limited no

01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:12.000
it's gonna stay up um

01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:14.000
until

01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:16.000
until we expire oobu

01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:18.000
market has been absolutely fantastic

01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:20.000
to work with um

01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:22.000
they are super good

01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:24.000
I am aware that

01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:26.000
they got a bit of flat because of some production issues

01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:28.000
but they actually

01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:30.000
moved um

01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:32.000
they moved locations

01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:34.000
quite a few times because their business

01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:36.000
expanded so fast that they basically

01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:38.000
had growing pains but I

01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:40.000
have never personally had an issue with them

01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:42.000
now I know that's kind of being like

01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:44.000
well you never had an issue with others that's

01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:46.000
just dismissing the others relax

01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:48.000
I understand how it works but

01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:50.000
um to work with oobu market

01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:52.000
they've been they were so understanding from

01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:54.000
the get go because I messaged them

01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:56.000
and I'm like hey violers

01:15:56.000 --> 01:15:58.000
the thing I'd love it if the girls can

01:15:58.000 --> 01:16:00.000
keep a hundred percent of the earnings

01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:02.000
uh we as the company

01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:04.000
don't want to take a cut and they're like yeah

01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:06.000
we can set that up no problem and I was

01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:08.000
like here here's all the references to the artwork

01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:10.000
yeah we can do that no problem

01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:12.000
um and just they've handled

01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:14.000
everything and it has been

01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:16.000
really nice to not have

01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:18.000
to deal with anything it makes things

01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:20.000
nice and juicy and easy

01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:22.000
um

01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:24.000
uh one of the thing

01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:26.000
few things about violers the lack of

01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:28.000
corporation greed yeah I just

01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:30.000
I I mean

01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:32.000
scrawny scrawny can your

01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:34.000
patterns go in reverse

01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:36.000
no they can't they can

01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:38.000
they only go in reverse if I

01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:40.000
do that it'll like

01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:42.000
should yeah see how it goes in reverse

01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:44.000
it's because it has to reset

01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:46.000
to the top of my head in order

01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:48.000
to do that reverse thing

01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:50.000
we can test that again

01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:52.000
yeah see how it reverses to the top of my head

01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:54.000
that's to make sure it works thank you for the

01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:56.000
ten barrel you know you could

01:16:56.000 --> 01:16:58.000
ask that for free uh you

01:16:58.000 --> 01:17:00.000
guys don't have to ask questions

01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:02.000
via um

01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:04.000
money uh

01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:06.000
it's not necessary

01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:08.000
it's really not necessary you don't have to

01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:10.000
ask questions via money you're more than welcome

01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:12.000

01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:16.000
um

01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:18.000
but yes um I am

01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:20.000
a very strong believer

01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:22.000
in um the girls

01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:24.000
earned the money they get to keep the lines

01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:26.000
share um

01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:28.000
because I don't

01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:30.000
I don't think it's very nice

01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:32.000
if the girls were only

01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:34.000
earning like the standard 50-50

01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:36.000
rate like what's your motivation

01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:38.000
to work if every time you make

01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:40.000
100 bucks uh management

01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:42.000
take 50 for doing a fall

01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:44.000
other than like handing you

01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:46.000
the model because at this point in time

01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:48.000
it's kind of like

01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:50.000
again egan

01:17:50.000 --> 01:17:52.000

01:17:56.000 --> 01:17:58.000

01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:02.000
do you have a rave party with your hair

01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:04.000

01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:06.000
with my hair other than the toggle

01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:08.000
I just like hearing my name spoken

01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:10.000
with a Scottish accent you should teach others

01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:12.000
how to speak like that I think it could be a thing

01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:14.000
well she be starting to

01:18:14.000 --> 01:18:16.000
develop a not a pretty decent

01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:18.000
Scottish accent

01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:20.000
um I don't know how much

01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:22.000
she used to watch me wink wink

01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:24.000
um but

01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:26.000
she certainly gives the impression she's listened

01:18:26.000 --> 01:18:28.000
to me for a decent amount

01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:30.000
but when we were playing garlic phone

01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:32.000

01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:42.000

01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:30.000
passed 22 minutes passed

01:20:30.000 --> 01:20:32.000
okay give us an hour

01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:34.000
and see how many swordfish we are

01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:36.000
because I don't know how fast I can

01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:38.000
like get through these

01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:40.000
thank you for the super chat

01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:42.000

01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:44.000

01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:46.000
Scottish cannot do

01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:48.000
yeah it gets caught

01:20:48.000 --> 01:20:50.000
my tongue gets caught on the roof of my mouth

01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:52.000
to try and enunciate burglar

01:20:52.000 --> 01:20:54.000
burglar burglar

01:20:54.000 --> 01:20:56.000
the box at the top left

01:20:56.000 --> 01:20:58.000
tells you how fast

01:20:58.000 --> 01:21:00.000
a thousand a thousand

01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:02.000
per hour so we will

01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:04.000
finish the swordfish I think

01:21:04.000 --> 01:21:06.000
we might be able to finish the swordfish

01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:08.000
if I don't get distracted and don't need

01:21:08.000 --> 01:21:10.000
like to go make too many teas

01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:14.000
I think at the three hour mark we'll take

01:21:14.000 --> 01:21:16.000
a toilet break

01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:18.000
and I'll get some food because I don't have any food

01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:20.000
in the morning like I just

01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:22.000
I wake up and I come on stream and I'm like

01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:24.000
alright what's going on that's what we're doing

01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:26.000
um

01:21:26.000 --> 01:21:28.000
with a steady pace

01:21:28.000 --> 01:21:30.000
you can do one an hour

01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:32.000
one K an hour

01:21:32.000 --> 01:21:34.000
that's that's pretty good

01:21:34.000 --> 01:21:36.000
that's really good

01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:38.000
right let's whittle this down

01:21:38.000 --> 01:21:40.000
to nothing then by the end of the stream

01:21:40.000 --> 01:21:42.000
we'll finish the stack of swordfish

01:21:42.000 --> 01:21:44.000
and see what leaves is that

01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:46.000
can you say hamburger

01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:48.000

01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:04.000

01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:06.000

01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:14.000

I didn't hear brian talk

01:22:28.000 --> 01:22:30.000
I wonder if brian doesn't talk during super chats

01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:20.000
scottish lad

01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:22.000
killets are always the first thing

01:23:22.000 --> 01:23:24.000
folk hone in on but

01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:26.000
you only wear killets during

01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:28.000
special events like weddings are

01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:30.000
probably the biggest kill thing

01:23:30.000 --> 01:23:32.000
is gimme inside my door

01:23:32.000 --> 01:23:34.000

kilt in elden ring

01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:42.000
so

01:23:42.000 --> 01:23:44.000
so then you guys can show up in a kilt

01:23:44.000 --> 01:23:46.000
and we can all get married in elden ring together

01:23:48.000 --> 01:23:50.000
that would be cute you know you're not

01:23:50.000 --> 01:23:52.000
supposed to wear boxers under a kilt either

01:23:54.000 --> 01:23:56.000
easy access

01:23:56.000 --> 01:23:58.000

01:24:04.000 --> 01:24:06.000
she gets attention

01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:08.000
I promise

01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:10.000
baby boy and baby girl get attention

01:24:14.000 --> 01:24:16.000
we're already

01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:18.000
at the 10.3

01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:20.000

scottish

01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:32.000
like that dress from ds

01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:34.000
worm it's for the ventilation

01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:36.000
literally you cannot

01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:38.000
get swamp ass via a kilt

01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:40.000
congrats

01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:42.000
um but

01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:44.000
your tatty bojangles

01:24:44.000 --> 01:24:46.000
will be bojangling I think

01:24:46.000 --> 01:24:48.000
I don't know how elastic

01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:50.000
yeah okay gimme lays me

01:24:50.000 --> 01:24:52.000
on out my door I can hear her go nuts

01:24:52.000 --> 01:24:54.000
she might start hammering on the door

01:24:54.000 --> 01:24:56.000
because she opens him by

01:24:56.000 --> 01:24:58.000
going up on her back legs and like pushing

01:24:58.000 --> 01:25:00.000
with her front paws so if you start hearing

01:25:00.000 --> 01:25:02.000
like that's her

01:25:02.000 --> 01:25:04.000
currently like opening the

01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:06.000
well attempting to open the door

01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:08.000
but I think

01:25:08.000 --> 01:25:10.000
you need to listen to this song

01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:12.000
donal where are your truzers

01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:14.000
it's a joke song about kilt I'd play it

01:25:14.000 --> 01:25:16.000
but I'd probably get copyright

01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:18.000
ridiculous oh my

01:25:18.000 --> 01:25:20.000
burn rate is 9%

01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:22.000
well hopefully that can get lowered

01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:24.000
because missing out on 10%

01:25:24.000 --> 01:25:26.000
xp on full inventories

01:25:26.000 --> 01:25:28.000
is rough

01:25:28.000 --> 01:25:30.000
is rough

01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:32.000
but we're getting there

01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:34.000
so how do I use it on the thing

01:25:34.000 --> 01:25:36.000
ta da

01:25:36.000 --> 01:25:38.000
let the boys be free

01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:40.000
as nature intended

01:25:40.000 --> 01:25:42.000
true yes

01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:44.000
I love wearing a kill always makes me feel confident

01:25:44.000 --> 01:25:46.000
I remember that one scene from the carry on

01:25:46.000 --> 01:25:48.000
films where the scott shows their

01:25:48.000 --> 01:25:50.000

01:25:50.000 --> 01:25:52.000
to scare people

01:25:52.000 --> 01:25:54.000
I'm sure it probably

01:25:54.000 --> 01:25:56.000
like get it up here

01:25:56.000 --> 01:25:58.000
I got the skirt

01:26:04.000 --> 01:26:06.000
18,000

01:26:06.000 --> 01:26:08.000
to climb a level

01:26:08.000 --> 01:26:10.000
we're starting to get there

01:26:10.000 --> 01:26:12.000
where it's taking

01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:14.000
a wee minute

01:26:14.000 --> 01:26:16.000
but that's okay

01:26:16.000 --> 01:26:18.000
we've got lots of time

01:26:18.000 --> 01:26:20.000
we've got all the time in the world

01:26:20.000 --> 01:26:22.000
but yes

01:26:22.000 --> 01:26:24.000
I'm going to let

01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:26.000
the girlfriend begs you

01:26:26.000 --> 01:26:28.000

she loves holding her pee

01:26:56.000 --> 01:26:58.000
I mean

01:27:00.000 --> 01:27:02.000
I know

01:27:02.000 --> 01:27:04.000
I am aware that it is

01:27:04.000 --> 01:27:06.000
an interest in certain individuals

01:27:06.000 --> 01:27:08.000
so

01:27:08.000 --> 01:27:10.000
whoever those individuals are

01:27:12.000 --> 01:27:14.000
I'm glad you are enjoying your little sister

01:27:14.000 --> 01:27:16.000
tormenting your little sister

01:27:18.000 --> 01:27:20.000
okay

01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:22.000
she peeped and then went back for more

01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:24.000
peep holding

01:27:26.000 --> 01:27:28.000
I never tell you that time

01:27:28.000 --> 01:27:30.000
someone paid me

01:27:30.000 --> 01:27:32.000
sorry let me rephrase that

01:27:32.000 --> 01:27:34.000
someone wanted to pay me

01:27:34.000 --> 01:27:36.000
$200 to stream

01:27:36.000 --> 01:27:38.000
but I drink

01:27:38.000 --> 01:27:40.000
like bottles of water every hour

01:27:40.000 --> 01:27:42.000
but I don't go to the toilet

01:27:42.000 --> 01:27:44.000
like it was their thing

01:27:44.000 --> 01:27:46.000
like they wanted me to be like

01:27:46.000 --> 01:27:48.000

01:27:58.000 --> 01:28:00.000
carry out with such a request

01:28:00.000 --> 01:28:02.000
however it was rather

01:28:02.000 --> 01:28:04.000
interesting learning about that because that was the first time I had ever been exposed to it

01:28:08.000 --> 01:28:10.000

shortly and like I gave her the

01:28:44.000 --> 01:28:46.000
script she needed and all that

01:28:46.000 --> 01:28:48.000
and I literally

01:28:48.000 --> 01:28:50.000
can't even say no to them I don't think I've ever

01:28:50.000 --> 01:28:52.000
said like oh

01:28:52.000 --> 01:28:54.000
so you're saying

01:28:54.000 --> 01:28:56.000
there's a chance it's not

01:28:56.000 --> 01:28:58.000
you was it you

01:28:58.000 --> 01:29:00.000
yeah calling yourself out

01:29:00.000 --> 01:29:02.000
chat

01:29:02.000 --> 01:29:04.000
gonna do some slaver

01:29:04.000 --> 01:29:06.000
we'll leave the main here oh

01:29:06.000 --> 01:29:08.000
Slayer sorry

01:29:08.000 --> 01:29:10.000
slaver is what's coming out my move

01:29:10.000 --> 01:29:12.000
because I can't stop

01:29:12.000 --> 01:29:14.000
salivating right now even though

01:29:14.000 --> 01:29:16.000
I'm like super dehydrated

01:29:16.000 --> 01:29:18.000
but there's a tactic

01:29:18.000 --> 01:29:20.000
to me being dehydrated

01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:22.000
it means I don't have to pee as much

01:29:22.000 --> 01:29:24.000
and then I can be here and max out

01:29:24.000 --> 01:29:26.000
the swordfish run

01:29:26.000 --> 01:29:28.000
yeah

01:29:28.000 --> 01:29:30.000
cuddles you're too subby you're not a good back

01:29:30.000 --> 01:29:32.000
corrector oh no they they get their way

01:29:32.000 --> 01:29:34.000
I'm sorry they all get their way I

01:29:34.000 --> 01:29:36.000
couldn't as long as they're happy

01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:38.000
I'm happy I get

01:29:38.000 --> 01:29:40.000
I genuinely get a dorphins

01:29:40.000 --> 01:29:42.000
knowing that they're happy or they have

01:29:42.000 --> 01:29:44.000
what they need and that's all

01:29:44.000 --> 01:29:46.000

01:29:46.000 --> 01:29:48.000

01:29:48.000 --> 01:29:50.000
Emy's

01:29:50.000 --> 01:29:52.000
Toastream I know that sounds

01:29:52.000 --> 01:29:54.000
really odd as a sentence

01:29:54.000 --> 01:29:56.000
but I want to see her little toes because

01:29:56.000 --> 01:29:58.000
her hands were freaking adorable

01:29:58.000 --> 01:30:00.000
on her cooking stream

01:30:00.000 --> 01:30:02.000
and

01:30:02.000 --> 01:30:04.000
Mercy might be doing a

01:30:04.000 --> 01:30:06.000
hand cam at a later date

01:30:06.000 --> 01:30:08.000

01:30:58.000 --> 01:31:00.000
um

01:31:00.000 --> 01:31:02.000

01:31:14.000 --> 01:31:16.000
icy that when if and when

01:31:16.000 --> 01:31:18.000
you want to do a hand cam stream

01:31:18.000 --> 01:31:20.000

01:31:22.000 --> 01:31:24.000

about me but it's

01:31:44.000 --> 01:31:46.000
because

01:31:46.000 --> 01:31:48.000
I'm biased

01:31:48.000 --> 01:31:50.000
towards Emmys design the most because

01:31:50.000 --> 01:31:52.000
it's like if I had a lighter voice

01:31:52.000 --> 01:31:54.000

icy ended up doing a full

01:32:04.000 --> 01:32:06.000
that oh

01:32:06.000 --> 01:32:08.000

01:32:08.000 --> 01:32:10.000
the

01:32:10.000 --> 01:32:12.000
the worst part is is that

01:32:12.000 --> 01:32:14.000
you're not even sorry I'm not

01:32:14.000 --> 01:32:16.000

01:32:28.000 --> 01:32:30.000
and get the correct ending

01:32:30.000 --> 01:32:32.000

doing something much more interesting

01:32:38.000 --> 01:32:40.000
because I am currently

01:32:40.000 --> 01:32:42.000

01:33:32.000 --> 01:33:34.000
mentioned in the money they gave me in chat

01:33:34.000 --> 01:33:36.000
I'm sure I read someone saying yeah I gave you that

01:33:36.000 --> 01:33:38.000
and then what

01:33:38.000 --> 01:33:40.000

01:33:42.000 --> 01:33:44.000
swordfish which was which was not

01:33:44.000 --> 01:33:46.000
cheap at all not cheap at all

01:33:46.000 --> 01:33:48.000
we are currently cooking through that

01:33:48.000 --> 01:33:50.000
and I am ranting and

01:33:50.000 --> 01:33:52.000
raving my head off

01:33:52.000 --> 01:33:54.000
just about anything

01:33:54.000 --> 01:33:56.000
and everything

01:33:56.000 --> 01:33:58.000
but yes I was currently

01:33:58.000 --> 01:34:00.000
gushing about the girls doing hand cam

01:34:00.000 --> 01:34:02.000
streams now that she

01:34:02.000 --> 01:34:04.000
is monetized I actually don't know when

01:34:04.000 --> 01:34:06.000
she's doing her monetization stream

01:34:06.000 --> 01:34:08.000
hold on let me just

01:34:08.000 --> 01:34:10.000
let me just ask her

01:34:10.000 --> 01:34:12.000
when are you

01:34:12.000 --> 01:34:14.000
doing monetization stream

01:34:14.000 --> 01:34:16.000
cause I might need to put her monetization live

01:34:16.000 --> 01:34:18.000
um

01:34:18.000 --> 01:34:20.000
oops cause I've not put her monetization live

01:34:20.000 --> 01:34:22.000
um

01:34:22.000 --> 01:34:24.000
and before you're like wait you control monetization

01:34:24.000 --> 01:34:26.000
no in order for the girls

01:34:26.000 --> 01:34:28.000
to be less stressed I do

01:34:28.000 --> 01:34:30.000
the kind of boring stuff

01:34:30.000 --> 01:34:32.000
which is opening up memberships and setting

01:34:32.000 --> 01:34:34.000
the price and adding her emotes

01:34:34.000 --> 01:34:36.000
to her badges for example

01:34:36.000 --> 01:34:38.000
um hey fart head

01:34:38.000 --> 01:34:40.000
hey shit

01:34:40.000 --> 01:34:42.000
sorry um

01:34:42.000 --> 01:34:44.000
yes so if she

01:34:44.000 --> 01:34:46.000
be plans on doing it

01:34:46.000 --> 01:34:48.000
day I will have to quickly run away

01:34:48.000 --> 01:34:50.000
for 5 minutes and quickly set that up

01:34:50.000 --> 01:34:52.000
because I don't have access to her account

01:34:52.000 --> 01:34:54.000
on the cc

01:34:54.000 --> 01:34:56.000
your cash is 20 times the cost of that

01:34:56.000 --> 01:34:58.000
swordfish though I know but I didn't do

01:34:58.000 --> 01:35:00.000
anything for the cash or the swordfish

01:35:00.000 --> 01:35:02.000
I just came I just got here

01:35:02.000 --> 01:35:04.000
um

01:35:04.000 --> 01:35:06.000
wow level 60

01:35:06.000 --> 01:35:08.000
wow

01:35:08.000 --> 01:35:10.000
that's amazing

01:35:10.000 --> 01:35:12.000
frickin 60

01:35:12.000 --> 01:35:14.000
how many are we burn

01:35:14.000 --> 01:35:16.000
or burn percentage is going up

01:35:16.000 --> 01:35:18.000
oh cause I know swordfish is a bit harder

01:35:18.000 --> 01:35:20.000
than what was cooked

01:35:20.000 --> 01:35:22.000
we are still doing

01:35:22.000 --> 01:35:24.000
1000 an hour

01:35:24.000 --> 01:35:26.000
it is possible I will beat

01:35:26.000 --> 01:35:28.000
the swordfish stack before

01:35:28.000 --> 01:35:30.000
um

01:35:30.000 --> 01:35:32.000
um

01:35:32.000 --> 01:35:34.000
just saying the chat that

01:35:34.000 --> 01:35:36.000
gave you the JP is 20 times

01:35:36.000 --> 01:35:38.000
killer than me

01:35:38.000 --> 01:35:40.000
um

01:35:40.000 --> 01:35:42.000
yeah basic management stuff

01:35:42.000 --> 01:35:44.000
um

01:35:44.000 --> 01:35:46.000
yes

01:35:46.000 --> 01:35:48.000
I'm putting their stuff live

01:35:48.000 --> 01:35:50.000
probably after the stream

01:35:50.000 --> 01:35:52.000
um because I need it to go up

01:35:52.000 --> 01:35:54.000
24 hours because

01:35:54.000 --> 01:35:56.000
so youtube says they need to approve the membership

01:35:56.000 --> 01:35:58.000
tiers but they don't approve

01:35:58.000 --> 01:36:00.000
nothing they literally

01:36:00.000 --> 01:36:02.000
um can go for it

01:36:02.000 --> 01:36:04.000
level 99 by the end of the stream

01:36:04.000 --> 01:36:06.000
trust just doing endurance stream right after

01:36:06.000 --> 01:36:08.000
closing the endurance stream honestly

01:36:08.000 --> 01:36:10.000
uh

01:36:10.000 --> 01:36:12.000
I could never do this

01:36:12.000 --> 01:36:14.000
I'm just giving it a shot it's always been a childhood

01:36:14.000 --> 01:36:16.000
dream of kind of like

01:36:16.000 --> 01:36:18.000
reaching 99 in any level

01:36:18.000 --> 01:36:20.000
as you can see we haven't even touched

01:36:20.000 --> 01:36:22.000
any of the member skills

01:36:22.000 --> 01:36:24.000
but um

01:36:24.000 --> 01:36:26.000
my combat is so low

01:36:26.000 --> 01:36:28.000
but literally having it up here

01:36:28.000 --> 01:36:30.000
is really nice um

01:36:30.000 --> 01:36:32.000
and I picked cooking because

01:36:32.000 --> 01:36:34.000
um I have incredibly

01:36:34.000 --> 01:36:36.000
baby memories

01:36:36.000 --> 01:36:38.000
of me being outside

01:36:38.000 --> 01:36:40.000
the back of lumbridge castle

01:36:40.000 --> 01:36:42.000
and I had

01:36:42.000 --> 01:36:44.000
my pickaxe

01:36:44.000 --> 01:36:46.000
I had my tinder box I had my

01:36:46.000 --> 01:36:48.000
my little basic bronze

01:36:48.000 --> 01:36:50.000
sword and I used

01:36:50.000 --> 01:36:52.000
to um kill the big

01:36:52.000 --> 01:36:54.000
rats outside the back of the castle

01:36:54.000 --> 01:36:56.000
cook them and I think

01:36:56.000 --> 01:36:58.000
the highest cooking level I ever got

01:36:58.000 --> 01:37:00.000
was 40 as a child

01:37:00.000 --> 01:37:02.000
um which is

01:37:02.000 --> 01:37:04.000
just freaking adorable which is

01:37:04.000 --> 01:37:06.000
why I want cooking 99

01:37:06.000 --> 01:37:08.000
first because I've just enjoyed it

01:37:08.000 --> 01:37:10.000
literally these gender norms have hands

01:37:10.000 --> 01:37:12.000
of course the whamen picks cooking

01:37:12.000 --> 01:37:14.000
oh we're about to get to 9000

01:37:14.000 --> 01:37:16.000
the stack is getting

01:37:16.000 --> 01:37:18.000
weir it's getting smaller

01:37:18.000 --> 01:37:20.000
getting a wee wee stack

01:37:20.000 --> 01:37:22.000
burnt swordfish is probably

01:37:22.000 --> 01:37:24.000
worth more than cooked on the open market

01:37:24.000 --> 01:37:26.000
these burnt food collectors are pretty

01:37:26.000 --> 01:37:28.000
oh I'm aware about the burnt food

01:37:28.000 --> 01:37:30.000
collectors um

01:37:30.000 --> 01:37:32.000
and they just give you a price for it

01:37:32.000 --> 01:37:34.000
which is pretty crazy

01:37:34.000 --> 01:37:36.000
um fire making is

01:37:36.000 --> 01:37:38.000
probably the next fast this is

01:37:38.000 --> 01:37:40.000
winter tod yes

01:37:40.000 --> 01:37:42.000
that was a ghost fires in winter tod

01:37:42.000 --> 01:37:44.000
or am I making that up

01:37:44.000 --> 01:37:46.000
I might be making that up

01:37:46.000 --> 01:37:48.000
I'm gonna be honest

01:37:48.000 --> 01:37:50.000
I might be going crazy

01:37:50.000 --> 01:37:52.000
uh my current level

01:37:52.000 --> 01:37:54.000
is 60 on the dot

01:37:54.000 --> 01:37:56.000
I did title the stream

01:37:56.000 --> 01:37:58.000
70 question mark

01:37:58.000 --> 01:38:00.000
but someone did napkin math

01:38:00.000 --> 01:38:02.000
and said if I finish cooking all these

01:38:02.000 --> 01:38:04.000
swordfish I might be

01:38:04.000 --> 01:38:06.000
78 which is just

01:38:06.000 --> 01:38:08.000
fantastic truly

01:38:08.000 --> 01:38:10.000
um

01:38:10.000 --> 01:38:12.000
but I thought the cooking

01:38:12.000 --> 01:38:14.000
thing was a meta meme like mommy knows

01:38:14.000 --> 01:38:16.000
how to cook here is the proof

01:38:16.000 --> 01:38:18.000
I mean honestly we could do it that way as well

01:38:18.000 --> 01:38:20.000
but I kinda did it as like oh these gender

01:38:20.000 --> 01:38:22.000
norms have hands I just really enjoy cooking

01:38:22.000 --> 01:38:24.000
like I know there's

01:38:24.000 --> 01:38:26.000
this in real life runescape chick

01:38:26.000 --> 01:38:28.000
and she has massive knockers

01:38:28.000 --> 01:38:30.000
I'm talking a zero level knockers

01:38:30.000 --> 01:38:32.000
and I used to just sit and watch her cook

01:38:32.000 --> 01:38:34.000
lobsters

01:38:34.000 --> 01:38:36.000
and like so many people would come in the chat

01:38:36.000 --> 01:38:38.000
and say such horrendous things

01:38:38.000 --> 01:38:40.000
when would it be the best food for winter tod

01:38:40.000 --> 01:38:42.000
so we keep

01:38:42.000 --> 01:38:44.000
oh gimli give it a rest

01:38:44.000 --> 01:38:46.000
darling I cannae have you in the room

01:38:46.000 --> 01:38:48.000
she's

01:38:48.000 --> 01:38:50.000
she's losing it

01:38:50.000 --> 01:38:52.000
she's losing it I don't know if it's coming up in the

01:38:52.000 --> 01:38:54.000
microphone or not but she's losing it

01:38:54.000 --> 01:38:56.000
and this is

01:38:56.000 --> 01:38:58.000
I shouldn't have let her in because now it's gonna take

01:38:58.000 --> 01:39:00.000
a couple of days for her to unlearn that she's

01:39:00.000 --> 01:39:02.000
allowed in this room

01:39:02.000 --> 01:39:04.000
ah gimli I can't hear her

01:39:04.000 --> 01:39:06.000
okay she's currently behind the door going

01:39:06.000 --> 01:39:08.000
meh

01:39:08.000 --> 01:39:10.000
basically

01:39:10.000 --> 01:39:12.000
um

01:39:12.000 --> 01:39:14.000
she should have given up by now

01:39:14.000 --> 01:39:16.000
and it's been

01:39:16.000 --> 01:39:18.000
it's been quite a while

01:39:18.000 --> 01:39:20.000
she should have gone to sleep I'm gonna be

01:39:20.000 --> 01:39:22.000
honest

01:39:22.000 --> 01:39:24.000
I should have played with her more

01:39:24.000 --> 01:39:26.000
I thought I ran out of time because I was making a cup

01:39:26.000 --> 01:39:28.000
of tea but I did feed her and

01:39:28.000 --> 01:39:30.000
I threw the mouse a few times to give her a few laps

01:39:30.000 --> 01:39:32.000
around through her dog

01:39:32.000 --> 01:39:34.000
she's not a dog she's a cat

01:39:36.000 --> 01:39:38.000
heaven forbid some tatas

01:39:38.000 --> 01:39:40.000
admit it we're all gimli

01:39:40.000 --> 01:39:42.000
I was kind of

01:39:42.000 --> 01:39:44.000
I was like talking to

01:39:44.000 --> 01:39:46.000
um Vigo

01:39:46.000 --> 01:39:48.000
and

01:39:48.000 --> 01:39:50.000
he gets really excited when I finish

01:39:50.000 --> 01:39:52.000
a stream

01:39:52.000 --> 01:39:54.000
and I was just talking to him and I'm like

01:39:54.000 --> 01:39:56.000
oh baby boy and I was petting him

01:39:56.000 --> 01:39:58.000
and he was purring

01:39:58.000 --> 01:40:00.000
and I was like I need to

01:40:00.000 --> 01:40:02.000
I've got two baby boys I've got

01:40:02.000 --> 01:40:04.000
refling and I've got baby boy

01:40:04.000 --> 01:40:06.000
Vigo

01:40:06.000 --> 01:40:08.000
and I need to split my time

01:40:08.000 --> 01:40:10.000
between them

01:40:10.000 --> 01:40:12.000
between us

01:40:12.000 --> 01:40:14.000
so it's really adorable

01:40:14.000 --> 01:40:16.000
he's such a good boy honestly he's like

01:40:16.000 --> 01:40:18.000
um

01:40:18.000 --> 01:40:20.000
de-refling are you there muggers

01:40:20.000 --> 01:40:22.000
get to that man whoever de-refling is

01:40:22.000 --> 01:40:24.000
because he'll give you jewellery

01:40:24.000 --> 01:40:26.000
um

01:40:26.000 --> 01:40:28.000
cute female kangaroo called Gimli

01:40:28.000 --> 01:40:30.000
she's a refling too never give up

01:40:30.000 --> 01:40:32.000
but she's got the

01:40:32.000 --> 01:40:34.000
she got that dog you know

01:40:34.000 --> 01:40:36.000
real cat girl is someone from

01:40:36.000 --> 01:40:38.000
Gimli when I was actually

01:40:38.000 --> 01:40:40.000
gonna do an in real life

01:40:40.000 --> 01:40:42.000
video where I put

01:40:42.000 --> 01:40:44.000
um

01:40:44.000 --> 01:40:46.000
a licky lick on the 3d o ears

01:40:46.000 --> 01:40:48.000
and then both my cats will lick it

01:40:48.000 --> 01:40:50.000
I don't know if YouTube will be weird

01:40:50.000 --> 01:40:52.000
about it because I

01:40:52.000 --> 01:40:54.000
don't know what's going on with your lickin in YouTube

01:40:54.000 --> 01:40:56.000
right now it's absolutely terrifying

01:40:56.000 --> 01:40:58.000
um

01:40:58.000 --> 01:41:00.000
I don't

01:41:00.000 --> 01:41:02.000
oh I keep messing that up

01:41:02.000 --> 01:41:04.000
sorry oh my god I'm not

01:41:04.000 --> 01:41:06.000
time maxing okay she's now knocking on the door

01:41:06.000 --> 01:41:08.000
Gimli

01:41:08.000 --> 01:41:10.000
don't do that

01:41:12.000 --> 01:41:14.000
ah

01:41:14.000 --> 01:41:16.000
mommy's no impressed Gimli didn't he do that

01:41:16.000 --> 01:41:18.000
he didn't have litter in yesterday

01:41:18.000 --> 01:41:20.000
it opened a can of worms

01:41:20.000 --> 01:41:22.000
oh

01:41:24.000 --> 01:41:26.000
um but yeah I thought

01:41:26.000 --> 01:41:28.000
can we see them the next hand cam

01:41:28.000 --> 01:41:30.000
you saw Gimli's back

01:41:30.000 --> 01:41:32.000
in the food

01:41:32.000 --> 01:41:34.000
in the celebration stream near the end of it

01:41:34.000 --> 01:41:36.000
you saw Gimli come in the room but had to take her out

01:41:36.000 --> 01:41:38.000
she was gonna knock over the webcam

01:41:38.000 --> 01:41:40.000
um I do have a picture of them

01:41:40.000 --> 01:41:42.000
um

01:41:42.000 --> 01:41:44.000
they killed a rat

01:41:44.000 --> 01:41:46.000
um so I thought

01:41:46.000 --> 01:41:48.000
Gimli was the hunter but no

01:41:48.000 --> 01:41:50.000
uh Vigo was the hunter

01:41:50.000 --> 01:41:52.000
he caught a rat

01:41:52.000 --> 01:41:54.000
in the garden I didn't even

01:41:54.000 --> 01:41:56.000
know it was there

01:41:56.000 --> 01:41:58.000
and he destroyed it

01:41:58.000 --> 01:42:00.000
so quickly

01:42:00.000 --> 01:42:02.000
um I'm pretty sure he like

01:42:02.000 --> 01:42:04.000
so if he didn't know

01:42:04.000 --> 01:42:06.000
the way that cats hunt

01:42:06.000 --> 01:42:08.000
is they apply pressure on the throat

01:42:08.000 --> 01:42:10.000
of the prey

01:42:10.000 --> 01:42:12.000
so basically

01:42:12.000 --> 01:42:14.000
it gets either suffocated

01:42:14.000 --> 01:42:16.000
or you know damaged

01:42:16.000 --> 01:42:18.000
out which is a shame to say

01:42:18.000 --> 01:42:20.000
Vigo

01:42:20.000 --> 01:42:22.000
I let him out in the garden

01:42:22.000 --> 01:42:24.000
and within 10 seconds

01:42:24.000 --> 01:42:26.000
he had perished

01:42:26.000 --> 01:42:28.000
the the rat

01:42:28.000 --> 01:42:30.000
I didn't I have a picture of it I'll maybe post it

01:42:30.000 --> 01:42:32.000
but I know people don't like seeing dead animals

01:42:32.000 --> 01:42:34.000
so maybe it's not too nice

01:42:34.000 --> 01:42:36.000
maybe I'll put like a little black bar

01:42:36.000 --> 01:42:38.000
over the rat's eyes just to

01:42:38.000 --> 01:42:40.000
protect its identity you know

01:42:40.000 --> 01:42:42.000
and it respect its wee family

01:42:42.000 --> 01:42:44.000
um

01:42:44.000 --> 01:42:46.000
damn though put it in me base

01:42:46.000 --> 01:42:48.000

01:42:48.000 --> 01:42:50.000
stalks you honestly

01:42:50.000 --> 01:42:52.000
um

01:42:54.000 --> 01:42:56.000
wait cat almost stalks me

01:42:56.000 --> 01:42:58.000

honestly if you are go and just leave me alone

01:43:00.000 --> 01:43:02.000
um

01:43:02.000 --> 01:43:04.000
but yeah we

01:43:04.000 --> 01:43:06.000
uh

01:43:06.000 --> 01:43:08.000
we Gimli we Vigo

01:43:08.000 --> 01:43:10.000

01:43:10.000 --> 01:43:12.000
is there somewhere we can

01:43:12.000 --> 01:43:14.000
send cat pics I mean you can just

01:43:14.000 --> 01:43:16.000

01:43:18.000 --> 01:43:20.000
uh

01:43:20.000 --> 01:43:22.000

01:43:26.000 --> 01:43:28.000
my cat is being a menace to the local bird

01:43:28.000 --> 01:43:30.000
population it's illegal

01:43:30.000 --> 01:43:32.000
to let your cats outside

01:43:32.000 --> 01:43:34.000
in Australia or

01:43:34.000 --> 01:43:36.000
I don't know if it's just in

01:43:36.000 --> 01:43:38.000
Victoria but it's illegal

01:43:38.000 --> 01:43:40.000
to let them out

01:43:40.000 --> 01:43:42.000
so I have a caged off

01:43:42.000 --> 01:43:44.000
background

01:43:44.000 --> 01:43:46.000
which is such a shame but I'd rather

01:43:46.000 --> 01:43:48.000
they get outside time than know outside time

01:43:48.000 --> 01:43:50.000
at all because I actually don't think it's natural

01:43:50.000 --> 01:43:52.000
for cats to be inside

01:43:52.000 --> 01:43:54.000
um

01:43:54.000 --> 01:43:56.000
but yeah they made it illegal

01:43:58.000 --> 01:44:00.000
um

01:44:00.000 --> 01:44:02.000
Australia does have a wild cat problem

01:44:02.000 --> 01:44:04.000
oh my god it's so sad I wish I didn't

01:44:04.000 --> 01:44:06.000
learn about it but they basically

01:44:06.000 --> 01:44:08.000
call wild cats instead of just

01:44:08.000 --> 01:44:10.000
doing capture and release because it's

01:44:10.000 --> 01:44:12.000
like so out of control type thing

01:44:12.000 --> 01:44:14.000
and I'm like

01:44:14.000 --> 01:44:16.000
bruh bruh

01:44:16.000 --> 01:44:18.000
although it's kind of like learning

01:44:18.000 --> 01:44:20.000
about cat island in Japan

01:44:20.000 --> 01:44:22.000
there's a tourist state island

01:44:22.000 --> 01:44:24.000
called cat island but the problem

01:44:24.000 --> 01:44:26.000
is none of the cats are

01:44:26.000 --> 01:44:28.000
fled or looked after or new urge so the

01:44:28.000 --> 01:44:30.000
population is completely out of control

01:44:30.000 --> 01:44:32.000
oh my god Gimli

01:44:32.000 --> 01:44:34.000
she's

01:44:34.000 --> 01:44:36.000
doing my head and

01:44:36.000 --> 01:44:38.000
oh my

01:44:38.000 --> 01:44:40.000
god

01:44:40.000 --> 01:44:42.000
Gimli

01:44:42.000 --> 01:44:44.000
I know you guys might not be able to

01:44:44.000 --> 01:44:46.000
hear her she's going to absolutely

01:44:46.000 --> 01:44:48.000
desert right now she should have given up

01:44:48.000 --> 01:44:50.000
like a long time ago and gone back to sleep

01:44:50.000 --> 01:44:52.000
what have I done I've created a monster

01:44:52.000 --> 01:44:54.000
because nobody wants to see

01:44:54.000 --> 01:44:56.000
mushroom no more he's chopped live

01:44:56.000 --> 01:44:58.000
I don't know the rest of the words

01:44:58.000 --> 01:45:00.000
I'm back

01:45:00.000 --> 01:45:02.000
baby

01:45:04.000 --> 01:45:06.000
um

01:45:06.000 --> 01:45:08.000
oh my god I can't think when she's

01:45:08.000 --> 01:45:10.000
me on wait hold on

01:45:12.000 --> 01:45:14.000
right she be I don't need to

01:45:14.000 --> 01:45:16.000
do her monetization

01:45:22.000 --> 01:45:24.000
okay I don't need to worry about sheepsters

01:45:24.000 --> 01:45:26.000
but I will be putting

01:45:26.000 --> 01:45:28.000
me and AC's thing

01:45:28.000 --> 01:45:30.000
live

01:45:30.000 --> 01:45:32.000
praying that a speller member names right

01:45:32.000 --> 01:45:34.000
but I'm pretty sure it's

01:45:34.000 --> 01:45:36.000
snow bear ease

01:45:36.000 --> 01:45:38.000
and

01:45:38.000 --> 01:45:40.000
pin pals

01:45:40.000 --> 01:45:42.000
snippets to me and

01:45:42.000 --> 01:45:44.000
moose

01:45:44.000 --> 01:45:46.000
should have picked any kind of youtube

01:45:46.000 --> 01:45:48.000
to be further driving the birds

01:45:48.000 --> 01:45:50.000
extinct yes I just think

01:45:50.000 --> 01:45:52.000
it's very dramatic

01:45:52.000 --> 01:45:54.000
to not only cast it

01:45:54.000 --> 01:45:56.000
you've been telling me I've been breaking the law for the past

01:45:56.000 --> 01:45:58.000
23 years and didn't know

01:45:58.000 --> 01:46:00.000
yeah like apparently it's gonna slow and

01:46:00.000 --> 01:46:02.000
England just made it that your cat has

01:46:02.000 --> 01:46:04.000
to get microchipped now

01:46:04.000 --> 01:46:06.000
and I'm like interesting

01:46:06.000 --> 01:46:08.000
but what's

01:46:08.000 --> 01:46:10.000
the real reason behind that because

01:46:10.000 --> 01:46:12.000
is it just like another tax on pet

01:46:12.000 --> 01:46:14.000
owners

01:46:14.000 --> 01:46:16.000
oh if you're a pet owner and you need

01:46:16.000 --> 01:46:18.000
to use litter by the way like a litter box

01:46:18.000 --> 01:46:20.000
you know how it's really

01:46:20.000 --> 01:46:22.000
expensive for litter box

01:46:22.000 --> 01:46:24.000
like pellets and all that

01:46:24.000 --> 01:46:26.000
play sand

01:46:26.000 --> 01:46:28.000
cats love to take big massive dookies

01:46:28.000 --> 01:46:30.000
in play sand which is the cheapest thing

01:46:30.000 --> 01:46:32.000
ever it lasts so long

01:46:32.000 --> 01:46:34.000
especially if you can have an

01:46:34.000 --> 01:46:36.000
outside litter tree for them if they have

01:46:36.000 --> 01:46:38.000
access to outside

01:46:38.000 --> 01:46:40.000
you will save literally hundreds

01:46:40.000 --> 01:46:42.000
upon thousands of dollars over

01:46:42.000 --> 01:46:44.000
the years

01:46:44.000 --> 01:46:46.000
it costs 8 dollars

01:46:46.000 --> 01:46:48.000
for a bag of sand and it costs

01:46:48.000 --> 01:46:50.000
20 for a decent cat grit

01:46:50.000 --> 01:46:52.000
just give them sand

01:46:52.000 --> 01:46:54.000
they love it you can scoop it

01:46:54.000 --> 01:46:56.000
it's super good

01:46:56.000 --> 01:46:58.000
and it saves your pockets

01:46:58.000 --> 01:47:00.000
so much money because

01:47:00.000 --> 01:47:02.000
there's such a tax on pet owners

01:47:02.000 --> 01:47:04.000
the only thing I haven't figured out yet

01:47:04.000 --> 01:47:06.000
is how to get good quality food

01:47:06.000 --> 01:47:08.000
because

01:47:08.000 --> 01:47:10.000
I was actually thinking

01:47:10.000 --> 01:47:12.000
of making like homemade cat

01:47:12.000 --> 01:47:14.000
the fire

01:47:14.000 --> 01:47:16.000
is gone no

01:47:16.000 --> 01:47:18.000
rifling what happened

01:47:18.000 --> 01:47:20.000
wait let me pick up the ashes hold on

01:47:20.000 --> 01:47:22.000
wait I can't I've got too much swordfish

01:47:22.000 --> 01:47:24.000
wait hold on hold on

01:47:24.000 --> 01:47:26.000
I'll pick up the ashes and take them out the way

01:47:26.000 --> 01:47:28.000
I need to put them out the way ok

01:47:28.000 --> 01:47:30.000
now the ashes are out the way

01:47:30.000 --> 01:47:32.000
no the embers have went out

01:47:32.000 --> 01:47:34.000
I've just picked up burnt fish as well by accident

01:47:36.000 --> 01:47:38.000
slim cuttles

01:47:38.000 --> 01:47:40.000
or strong shady

01:47:40.000 --> 01:47:42.000
excellent cuttle sounds better

01:47:44.000 --> 01:47:46.000
always thought it would be cute to have a big

01:47:46.000 --> 01:47:48.000
chunky cat

01:47:48.000 --> 01:47:50.000
oh well thanks for the tip

01:47:50.000 --> 01:47:52.000
I can't even remember what the tip was

01:47:52.000 --> 01:47:54.000
thank you for putting the fire back on again rifling

01:47:54.000 --> 01:47:56.000
it's over

01:47:56.000 --> 01:47:58.000
they didn't kindle the fire

01:47:58.000 --> 01:48:00.000
now it's the age of darkness

01:48:00.000 --> 01:48:02.000
crazy concept

01:48:02.000 --> 01:48:04.000
go fishin

01:48:04.000 --> 01:48:06.000
the riflings would happily taste test

01:48:06.000 --> 01:48:08.000
your homemade cat food yeah

01:48:08.000 --> 01:48:10.000
I wanted to make homemade thank you for getting me back

01:48:10.000 --> 01:48:12.000
on the subject because I completely forgot

01:48:12.000 --> 01:48:14.000
what I was rambling about

01:48:14.000 --> 01:48:16.000
I

01:48:16.000 --> 01:48:18.000
wanted to make homemade cat food

01:48:18.000 --> 01:48:20.000
because they were struggling to eat

01:48:20.000 --> 01:48:22.000
like that pre-made stuff

01:48:22.000 --> 01:48:24.000
and the thing

01:48:24.000 --> 01:48:26.000
this sounds really bad

01:48:26.000 --> 01:48:28.000
but on the boxes of cat food

01:48:28.000 --> 01:48:30.000
it says not fit for human consumption

01:48:30.000 --> 01:48:32.000
ok

01:48:32.000 --> 01:48:34.000
now the reason why that

01:48:34.000 --> 01:48:36.000
alarms me is because I would never

01:48:36.000 --> 01:48:38.000
want to give my cat something that I couldn't

01:48:38.000 --> 01:48:40.000
eat and cats eat meat cats are

01:48:42.000 --> 01:48:44.000
wow 61

01:48:44.000 --> 01:48:46.000
thank you

01:48:46.000 --> 01:48:48.000
thank you riflings for funding my

01:48:48.000 --> 01:48:50.000
cooking habit

01:48:52.000 --> 01:48:54.000
yeah I just find it

01:48:54.000 --> 01:48:56.000
a bit hmm

01:48:56.000 --> 01:48:58.000
and sus

01:48:58.000 --> 01:49:00.000
that

01:49:00.000 --> 01:49:02.000
it's not fit for human consumption

01:49:02.000 --> 01:49:04.000
when the content is just supposed to be meat

01:49:04.000 --> 01:49:06.000
that's possible for

01:49:06.000 --> 01:49:08.000
cats to eat

01:49:08.000 --> 01:49:10.000
which I don't like

01:49:10.000 --> 01:49:12.000
VV buys a rotisserie chicken

01:49:12.000 --> 01:49:14.000
cats didn't like

01:49:14.000 --> 01:49:16.000
I fed them it

01:49:16.000 --> 01:49:18.000
you know who liked

01:49:18.000 --> 01:49:20.000
more than my cats

01:49:20.000 --> 01:49:22.000
the magpies

01:49:22.000 --> 01:49:24.000
which I've yet to name

01:49:24.000 --> 01:49:26.000
it's

01:49:26.000 --> 01:49:28.000
a husband magpie

01:49:28.000 --> 01:49:30.000
a wife magpie and a daughter magpie

01:49:30.000 --> 01:49:32.000
that visits me

01:49:32.000 --> 01:49:34.000
oh no

01:49:36.000 --> 01:49:38.000
rifling

01:49:38.000 --> 01:49:40.000
is the rifling afk that normally does

01:49:40.000 --> 01:49:42.000
like the big log pile

01:49:42.000 --> 01:49:44.000
wait I'll clear away the ashes hold on

01:49:44.000 --> 01:49:46.000
there you go it's out of the way

01:49:46.000 --> 01:49:48.000
I keep clicking collect

01:49:48.000 --> 01:49:50.000
bank banker

01:49:50.000 --> 01:49:52.000
take that out then take it raw

01:49:52.000 --> 01:49:54.000
ooh we're at 9.8

01:49:56.000 --> 01:49:58.000
fire fire fire

01:49:58.000 --> 01:50:00.000
we're so on fire

01:50:00.000 --> 01:50:02.000
praise the fire praise the sun

01:50:04.000 --> 01:50:06.000
pet food in general

01:50:06.000 --> 01:50:08.000
is a rarity

01:50:08.000 --> 01:50:10.000
affordable

01:50:10.000 --> 01:50:12.000
mmm it's like ridiculous pricing

01:50:12.000 --> 01:50:14.000
as well like I'm not happy with the price as well

01:50:14.000 --> 01:50:16.000
but I thought it would be really cute

01:50:16.000 --> 01:50:18.000
to make like

01:50:18.000 --> 01:50:20.000
homemade cat food for them

01:50:20.000 --> 01:50:22.000
it wouldn't be the best but like I've seen

01:50:22.000 --> 01:50:24.000
this youtube channel

01:50:24.000 --> 01:50:26.000
I think it's called June's Kitchen

01:50:26.000 --> 01:50:28.000
and it's literally dedicated

01:50:28.000 --> 01:50:30.000
to feeding the cats

01:50:30.000 --> 01:50:32.000
gourmet homemade food

01:50:32.000 --> 01:50:34.000
and it's the most adorable thing ever

01:50:34.000 --> 01:50:36.000
and I'm like that's what I want to do for V going in

01:50:36.000 --> 01:50:38.000
cats are hyper carnivores

01:50:38.000 --> 01:50:40.000
yes carnivores

01:50:40.000 --> 01:50:42.000
I almost said omnivores

01:50:42.000 --> 01:50:44.000
but omnivores is both

01:50:44.000 --> 01:50:46.000
what's vegetarian

01:50:46.000 --> 01:50:48.000
wait wait

01:50:48.000 --> 01:50:50.000
oh sorry I did that I was pre-firing

01:50:50.000 --> 01:50:52.000
I got excited there ok we're now

01:50:52.000 --> 01:50:54.000
9.7 let's go

01:50:54.000 --> 01:50:56.000
9.7

01:50:56.000 --> 01:50:58.000
oh hydration check

01:50:58.000 --> 01:51:00.000
my voice is starting to waver a little bit

01:51:00.000 --> 01:51:02.000
herbivores that's right that's right

01:51:02.000 --> 01:51:04.000
herbivores for dinosaurs

01:51:04.000 --> 01:51:06.000
is

01:51:06.000 --> 01:51:08.000
vegetable

01:51:08.000 --> 01:51:10.000
hmm

01:51:10.000 --> 01:51:12.000
oh dear my voice is breaking

01:51:12.000 --> 01:51:14.000
and we're partly even got started with the injured stream

01:51:14.000 --> 01:51:16.000
you

01:51:16.000 --> 01:51:18.000
just friendly reminder

01:51:18.000 --> 01:51:20.000
in the link in the description

01:51:20.000 --> 01:51:22.000
M.E.B.Zoo is live with

01:51:22.000 --> 01:51:24.000
the coffin of Andy and Lele

01:51:24.000 --> 01:51:26.000
a very fun and unique

01:51:26.000 --> 01:51:28.000
experience video game storyline

01:51:28.000 --> 01:51:30.000
and plot very unique absolutely no one is denying that

01:51:30.000 --> 01:51:32.000
hmm

01:51:32.000 --> 01:51:34.000
I'm lucky I work as a cook

01:51:34.000 --> 01:51:36.000
I just bring home

01:51:36.000 --> 01:51:38.000
food for leftovers

01:51:38.000 --> 01:51:40.000
and it's free most of the time

01:51:40.000 --> 01:51:42.000
yes oh my god

01:51:42.000 --> 01:51:44.000
when I used to work as a waitress

01:51:44.000 --> 01:51:46.000
the best part was like getting sent home

01:51:46.000 --> 01:51:48.000
with like all these treats and food

01:51:48.000 --> 01:51:50.000
and aww it was so good

01:51:50.000 --> 01:51:52.000
it was so good

01:51:52.000 --> 01:51:54.000
oh man she's almost at 6k

01:51:54.000 --> 01:51:56.000
so am I

01:51:56.000 --> 01:51:58.000
wait what happened

01:51:58.000 --> 01:52:00.000
I was 5

01:52:00.000 --> 01:52:02.000
thousand yesterday hold on

01:52:02.000 --> 01:52:04.000
hold on

01:52:04.000 --> 01:52:06.000
let me do a new batch of

01:52:06.000 --> 01:52:08.000
where did we celebrate

01:52:08.000 --> 01:52:10.000
5k wait how popular

01:52:10.000 --> 01:52:12.000
did that freaking ASMR video get

01:52:12.000 --> 01:52:14.000
am I missing something

01:52:14.000 --> 01:52:16.000
I matter

01:52:16.000 --> 01:52:18.000
hold on

01:52:18.000 --> 01:52:20.000
wow

01:52:20.000 --> 01:52:22.000
that ASMR video got 18,000 views

01:52:24.000 --> 01:52:26.000
I only have 5,000 subscribers

01:52:30.000 --> 01:52:32.000
what

01:52:32.000 --> 01:52:34.000
what happened

01:52:42.000 --> 01:52:44.000
what did they get picked is there a

01:52:44.000 --> 01:52:46.000
tag it got picked up on

01:52:46.000 --> 01:52:48.000
hold on wait I can

01:52:48.000 --> 01:52:50.000
ah I can't see if there's a certain

01:52:50.000 --> 01:52:52.000
tag it got picked up on

01:52:52.000 --> 01:52:54.000
what how bizarre

01:53:00.000 --> 01:53:02.000
wait let's see what the analytics say

01:53:06.000 --> 01:53:08.000
okay that

01:53:08.000 --> 01:53:10.000
top traffic source

01:53:10.000 --> 01:53:12.000
browse feature

01:53:12.000 --> 01:53:14.000
other youtube features channel page

01:53:14.000 --> 01:53:16.000
suggested videos and external

01:53:16.000 --> 01:53:18.000
what's browse feature

01:53:18.000 --> 01:53:20.000
is browse feature like in the feed in general

01:53:24.000 --> 01:53:26.000
hold on let me do a new stack

01:53:26.000 --> 01:53:28.000
sorry I know you can't see the stats

01:53:28.000 --> 01:53:30.000
I'm looking at

01:53:30.000 --> 01:53:32.000
is browse feature just like in the side

01:53:32.000 --> 01:53:34.000
window

01:53:34.000 --> 01:53:36.000
probably hit the algorithm

01:53:36.000 --> 01:53:38.000
it was good

01:53:38.000 --> 01:53:40.000
oh

01:53:40.000 --> 01:53:42.000
I'm at 6k I've not even done the first

01:53:42.000 --> 01:53:44.000
thank you celebration

01:53:44.000 --> 01:53:46.000
what oh wait

01:53:46.000 --> 01:53:48.000
hold on let me screenshot this so you guys

01:53:48.000 --> 01:53:50.000
can see what I see you can see

01:53:50.000 --> 01:53:52.000
I'm not

01:53:52.000 --> 01:53:54.000
I'm not a secret

01:53:54.000 --> 01:53:56.000
kind of creator I'll show you what I see

01:53:56.000 --> 01:53:58.000
this is what I see on the video

01:53:58.000 --> 01:54:00.000
it hasn't updated the

01:54:00.000 --> 01:54:02.000
where is it

01:54:06.000 --> 01:54:08.000
it hasn't

01:54:08.000 --> 01:54:10.000
ah

01:54:10.000 --> 01:54:12.000
that would be too easy wouldn't it

01:54:12.000 --> 01:54:14.000
image make source

01:54:14.000 --> 01:54:16.000
this is just youtube stats

01:54:16.000 --> 01:54:18.000
video I guess

01:54:18.000 --> 01:54:20.000
okay

01:54:20.000 --> 01:54:22.000
and then pick this one on my desktop please

01:54:22.000 --> 01:54:24.000
is that it

01:54:24.000 --> 01:54:26.000
this video

01:54:26.000 --> 01:54:28.000
wow

01:54:28.000 --> 01:54:30.000
what on earth

01:54:30.000 --> 01:54:32.000
do you see that

01:54:36.000 --> 01:54:38.000
holy

01:54:38.000 --> 01:54:40.000
what on earth

01:54:40.000 --> 01:54:42.000
that got pushed so much

01:54:42.000 --> 01:54:44.000
look at browse feature

01:54:44.000 --> 01:54:46.000
76 percent

01:54:46.000 --> 01:54:48.000
browse feature my goodness

01:54:48.000 --> 01:54:50.000
but look

01:54:50.000 --> 01:54:52.000
it says I got 300 subscribers

01:54:52.000 --> 01:54:54.000
for it the money hasn't

01:54:54.000 --> 01:54:56.000
updated because it takes like 48 hours

01:54:56.000 --> 01:54:58.000
for the money to show

01:54:58.000 --> 01:55:00.000
wow I did not expect that

01:55:00.000 --> 01:55:02.000
the fact

01:55:02.000 --> 01:55:04.000
the watch time is 1.8k

01:55:04.000 --> 01:55:06.000
hours if you didn't know to get monetized

01:55:06.000 --> 01:55:08.000
you need 3k watch hours

01:55:08.000 --> 01:55:10.000
holy crap

01:55:10.000 --> 01:55:12.000
maybe

01:55:12.000 --> 01:55:14.000
maybe gen 2 should come out with an ASMR

01:55:14.000 --> 01:55:16.000
video before debut but kind of ruins the

01:55:16.000 --> 01:55:18.000
voice although saying that you hear the voice

01:55:18.000 --> 01:55:20.000
in the trailer in the shorts anyways

01:55:20.000 --> 01:55:22.000
that much of a deal because it might help with the culling

01:55:22.000 --> 01:55:24.000
if the girls came out with an ASMR video

01:55:24.000 --> 01:55:26.000
for gen 2

01:55:26.000 --> 01:55:28.000
nice when quality

01:55:28.000 --> 01:55:30.000
is rewarded but look at that

01:55:30.000 --> 01:55:32.000
a browse feature

01:55:32.000 --> 01:55:34.000
source that's pretty

01:55:34.000 --> 01:55:36.000
that's pretty nice

01:55:36.000 --> 01:55:38.000
sorry my tummy is rumbling if you heard that

01:55:40.000 --> 01:55:42.000
literally I've not even got my first thank

01:55:42.000 --> 01:55:44.000
you for 1k out yet

01:55:44.000 --> 01:55:46.000
oh

01:55:46.000 --> 01:55:48.000
oh my god

01:55:48.000 --> 01:55:50.000
yeah whoa

01:55:50.000 --> 01:55:52.000
I'm 5800 I literally

01:55:52.000 --> 01:55:54.000
tweeted like thanks for 5k yesterday

01:55:54.000 --> 01:55:56.000
holy crap

01:55:56.000 --> 01:55:58.000
that's insane

01:55:58.000 --> 01:56:00.000
your trailer hooked me pretty hard

01:56:00.000 --> 01:56:02.000
yeah you're like I'm Scott

01:56:02.000 --> 01:56:04.000
oh yeah

01:56:04.000 --> 01:56:06.000
oh cloud he's Scott

01:56:06.000 --> 01:56:08.000
win win

01:56:08.000 --> 01:56:10.000
well I wasn't lying during debut

01:56:10.000 --> 01:56:12.000
and I was like you'll be eating good if you're an ASMR

01:56:12.000 --> 01:56:14.000
enthusiast

01:56:14.000 --> 01:56:16.000
it's unlikely

01:56:16.000 --> 01:56:18.000
I'll get that first video out today

01:56:18.000 --> 01:56:20.000
because

01:56:20.000 --> 01:56:22.000
I'm doing AC and Emmys membership

01:56:22.000 --> 01:56:24.000
when I get offline

01:56:24.000 --> 01:56:26.000
and then I'm probably collapsing

01:56:26.000 --> 01:56:28.000
unless although I will say it's really

01:56:28.000 --> 01:56:30.000
fun editing my

01:56:30.000 --> 01:56:32.000
thank you videos because

01:56:32.000 --> 01:56:34.000
I'm like

01:56:34.000 --> 01:56:36.000
I'm not making it super professional

01:56:36.000 --> 01:56:38.000
and like editing out all the bumps I'm just

01:56:38.000 --> 01:56:40.000
lowering the bumps in that so it's still

01:56:40.000 --> 01:56:42.000
like on the same level

01:56:42.000 --> 01:56:44.000
the culling was so silly

01:56:44.000 --> 01:56:46.000
it was absolutely insane

01:56:46.000 --> 01:56:48.000
on AC

01:56:48.000 --> 01:56:50.000
I mentioned this yesterday so don't worry

01:56:50.000 --> 01:56:52.000
if you didn't hear it but AC

01:56:52.000 --> 01:56:54.000
got called

01:56:54.000 --> 01:56:56.000
1500 subscribers and on the same

01:56:56.000 --> 01:56:58.000
day I got called 700

01:56:58.000 --> 01:57:00.000
subscribers even though

01:57:00.000 --> 01:57:02.000
she had more shorts out like I was

01:57:02.000 --> 01:57:04.000
pushing shorts on AC

01:57:04.000 --> 01:57:06.000
at the time

01:57:06.000 --> 01:57:08.000
that's just crazy

01:57:08.000 --> 01:57:10.000
do you love a cheeky bit of ASMR?

01:57:14.000 --> 01:57:16.000
it was so rough on AC

01:57:16.000 --> 01:57:18.000
but she's been doing fantastic honestly

01:57:20.000 --> 01:57:22.000
I

01:57:22.000 --> 01:57:24.000
am

01:57:24.000 --> 01:57:26.000
still interested in a clipper program

01:57:26.000 --> 01:57:28.000
for the girls

01:57:28.000 --> 01:57:30.000
I'm just waiting for

01:57:30.000 --> 01:57:32.000
the first month of income to come in

01:57:32.000 --> 01:57:34.000
and then I can kind of open up pie charts

01:57:34.000 --> 01:57:36.000
and be like right is this

01:57:36.000 --> 01:57:38.000
going to be possible

01:57:38.000 --> 01:57:40.000
for Vehler to do a clipping program

01:57:40.000 --> 01:57:42.000
like Idol N has done because I really

01:57:42.000 --> 01:57:44.000
like it I think it's a really good way

01:57:44.000 --> 01:57:46.000
to get clippers involved and

01:57:46.000 --> 01:57:48.000
help promote the girls

01:57:48.000 --> 01:57:50.000
and all that jazz I think it's fantastic

01:57:50.000 --> 01:57:52.000
so we are still looking into that

01:57:52.000 --> 01:57:54.000
and hopefully it will

01:57:54.000 --> 01:57:56.000
give the girls a cheeky boost

01:57:58.000 --> 01:58:00.000
I've had to re-sub

01:58:00.000 --> 01:58:02.000
three times yeah like every really

01:58:02.000 --> 01:58:04.000
I had to freaking subscribe back onto the girls

01:58:04.000 --> 01:58:06.000
at one point as well I was like bruh

01:58:06.000 --> 01:58:08.000
we were literally all each other's first subscribers

01:58:08.000 --> 01:58:10.000
and I got booted off and I'm like great

01:58:10.000 --> 01:58:12.000
you've stolen it from me

01:58:12.000 --> 01:58:14.000
you too

01:58:14.000 --> 01:58:16.000
absolutely stolen it

01:58:18.000 --> 01:58:20.000
I hope those missing 1,500

01:58:20.000 --> 01:58:22.000
would you sans find their way to her

01:58:22.000 --> 01:58:24.000
honestly though

01:58:24.000 --> 01:58:26.000
I'm sure they will I'm sure they'll be like

01:58:26.000 --> 01:58:28.000
hey wasn't there a cute polar bear around here

01:58:28.000 --> 01:58:30.000
at one point

01:58:30.000 --> 01:58:32.000
if you interact with the content

01:58:32.000 --> 01:58:34.000
leave a like on stream

01:58:34.000 --> 01:58:36.000
or leave a comment

01:58:36.000 --> 01:58:38.000
then the algorithm will show the girl

01:58:38.000 --> 01:58:40.000
more to you

01:58:40.000 --> 01:58:42.000
so if you are an OG

01:58:42.000 --> 01:58:44.000
you're like her streams are never showing up

01:58:44.000 --> 01:58:46.000
please do consider like

01:58:46.000 --> 01:58:48.000
just going on her short feed

01:58:48.000 --> 01:58:50.000
for example

01:58:50.000 --> 01:58:52.000
don't like the stuff right away

01:58:52.000 --> 01:58:54.000
genuinely sit and watch it because if you don't

01:58:54.000 --> 01:58:56.000
sit and watch it then the algorithm

01:58:56.000 --> 01:58:58.000
knows that you are just sitting there

01:58:58.000 --> 01:59:00.000
it's really annoying

01:59:00.000 --> 01:59:02.000
but the algorithm is now too

01:59:02.000 --> 01:59:04.000
advanced

01:59:04.000 --> 01:59:06.000
because before way back

01:59:06.000 --> 01:59:08.000
and much older youtube days

01:59:08.000 --> 01:59:10.000
if you left a like

01:59:10.000 --> 01:59:12.000
you left a like

01:59:12.000 --> 01:59:14.000
but now the algorithm is like

01:59:14.000 --> 01:59:16.000
this person left a like at the 2 minute mark

01:59:16.000 --> 01:59:18.000
maybe something interesting happened 2 minutes in

01:59:18.000 --> 01:59:20.000
ok because of that statistic

01:59:20.000 --> 01:59:22.000
we're going to now

01:59:22.000 --> 01:59:24.000
promote this video to

01:59:24.000 --> 01:59:26.000
people who

01:59:26.000 --> 01:59:28.000
have interacted with this vtuber

01:59:28.000 --> 01:59:30.000
the algorithm just gets so

01:59:30.000 --> 01:59:32.000
silly

01:59:32.000 --> 01:59:34.000
I'm dying for the hypnovis

01:59:34.000 --> 01:59:36.000
the hypnovis

01:59:36.000 --> 01:59:38.000
can actually go on youtube

01:59:38.000 --> 01:59:40.000
youtube allows hypnosis

01:59:40.000 --> 01:59:42.000
patreon doesn't

01:59:42.000 --> 01:59:44.000
make it make sense

01:59:44.000 --> 01:59:46.000
but we love youtube out here for that reason

01:59:46.000 --> 01:59:48.000
it's very

01:59:48.000 --> 01:59:50.000
strange

01:59:50.000 --> 01:59:52.000
probably the first hit

01:59:52.000 --> 01:59:54.000
sorry

01:59:54.000 --> 01:59:56.000
take this burnt swordfish

01:59:56.000 --> 01:59:58.000
the first

01:59:58.000 --> 02:00:00.000
ASMR I'm going to do is

02:00:00.000 --> 02:00:02.000
forget your name

02:00:02.000 --> 02:00:04.000
and replace it with reefling

02:00:06.000 --> 02:00:08.000
I will not make it a permanent

02:00:08.000 --> 02:00:10.000
effect

02:00:10.000 --> 02:00:12.000
I will make it a session

02:00:12.000 --> 02:00:14.000
I think maybe a 30 minute session

02:00:14.000 --> 02:00:16.000
if you will

02:00:18.000 --> 02:00:20.000
and I'll maybe give it like 2 hour

02:00:20.000 --> 02:00:22.000
effect I really do not want to

02:00:22.000 --> 02:00:24.000
mess around with permanent effects too much

02:00:24.000 --> 02:00:26.000
it kind of scares me permanent effect

02:00:26.000 --> 02:00:28.000
stuff I have to be honest I'm a bit of a scaredy cat

02:00:28.000 --> 02:00:30.000
ooh our burn percentage

02:00:30.000 --> 02:00:32.000
is up to 15

02:00:32.000 --> 02:00:34.000
I think it's holding

02:00:34.000 --> 02:00:36.000
steady at 15 though

02:00:36.000 --> 02:00:38.000
and hopefully it'll lower as we

02:00:38.000 --> 02:00:40.000
get more leveled up

02:00:42.000 --> 02:00:44.000
wait no hypnosis no

02:00:44.000 --> 02:00:46.000
hypnosis is ban

02:00:46.000 --> 02:00:48.000
it is a bannable

02:00:48.000 --> 02:00:50.000
offense

02:00:50.000 --> 02:00:52.000
suspendable offense if you will

02:00:52.000 --> 02:00:54.000
there was

02:00:54.000 --> 02:00:56.000
a ASMRist actually that got

02:00:56.000 --> 02:00:58.000
their entire patreon taken down

02:00:58.000 --> 02:01:00.000
not even a chance to

02:01:02.000 --> 02:01:04.000
appeal or

02:01:04.000 --> 02:01:06.000
get suspended and then delete the content

02:01:06.000 --> 02:01:08.000
sometimes patreon will suspend

02:01:08.000 --> 02:01:10.000
your account until you

02:01:10.000 --> 02:01:12.000
your content

02:01:12.000 --> 02:01:14.000
applies to their tos so if it's not

02:01:14.000 --> 02:01:16.000
too offensive whatever you've done or made

02:01:16.000 --> 02:01:18.000
but

02:01:18.000 --> 02:01:20.000
there wasn't ASMRist recently who got their

02:01:20.000 --> 02:01:22.000
entire thing just taken down which was

02:01:22.000 --> 02:01:24.000
pretty crazy

02:01:24.000 --> 02:01:26.000
just making me permanently less procrastinate

02:01:28.000 --> 02:01:30.000
yeah honestly only a bit of mind break

02:01:30.000 --> 02:01:32.000
I feel you

02:01:32.000 --> 02:01:34.000
yeah a chubby

02:01:34.000 --> 02:01:36.000
weight gain that got

02:01:36.000 --> 02:01:38.000
taken away

02:01:38.000 --> 02:01:40.000
which was crazy

02:01:40.000 --> 02:01:42.000
absolutely crazy I'm not sure

02:01:44.000 --> 02:01:46.000
I mean I

02:01:46.000 --> 02:01:48.000
I can see

02:01:48.000 --> 02:01:50.000
why because sometimes this stuff is

02:01:50.000 --> 02:01:52.000
like tied down to a chair and funnel fed

02:01:52.000 --> 02:01:54.000
or whatever but

02:01:54.000 --> 02:01:56.000
it just gets ridiculous because whoever's

02:01:56.000 --> 02:01:58.000
participating or creating especially

02:01:58.000 --> 02:02:00.000
for when it comes to audio side of stuff

02:02:00.000 --> 02:02:02.000
like no visuals no nothing

02:02:02.000 --> 02:02:04.000
like it gets pretty ridiculous

02:02:04.000 --> 02:02:06.000
like that you can't

02:02:06.000 --> 02:02:08.000
do it like but anyway

02:02:08.000 --> 02:02:10.000
all hail her master

02:02:10.000 --> 02:02:12.000
card overlords yes yes

02:02:12.000 --> 02:02:14.000
yes yes you win yeah again you win

02:02:14.000 --> 02:02:16.000
you win again

02:02:16.000 --> 02:02:18.000
hey ho you win again

02:02:18.000 --> 02:02:20.000
um

02:02:20.000 --> 02:02:22.000
who's thinking

02:02:22.000 --> 02:02:24.000
up all these rules and restrictions are overlords

02:02:24.000 --> 02:02:26.000
don't you not know about them

02:02:26.000 --> 02:02:28.000
see there's this company called

02:02:28.000 --> 02:02:30.000
black rock and then there's a second

02:02:30.000 --> 02:02:32.000
company called I've forgotten the name of the

02:02:32.000 --> 02:02:34.000
second company and they own everything

02:02:34.000 --> 02:02:36.000
um

02:02:36.000 --> 02:02:38.000
and uh oh wait until you

02:02:38.000 --> 02:02:40.000
learn about politics oh my goodness

02:02:40.000 --> 02:02:42.000
can't wait to get started about the

02:02:42.000 --> 02:02:44.000
political side of thing and no I'm

02:02:44.000 --> 02:02:46.000
not getting into politics but I'll get into

02:02:46.000 --> 02:02:48.000
destroying the economy and

02:02:48.000 --> 02:02:50.000
we should restart society

02:02:50.000 --> 02:02:52.000
or run away to a farm together

02:02:52.000 --> 02:02:54.000
I'm more opting for the farm

02:02:54.000 --> 02:02:56.000
side of things um

02:02:56.000 --> 02:02:58.000
because

02:02:58.000 --> 02:03:00.000
yeah the farm would be a heck

02:03:00.000 --> 02:03:02.000
of a lot better option

02:03:04.000 --> 02:03:06.000
um

02:03:06.000 --> 02:03:08.000
CNC is not okay with Patreon

02:03:08.000 --> 02:03:10.000
which hit me yes the

02:03:10.000 --> 02:03:12.000
oh 62

02:03:12.000 --> 02:03:14.000
thank you 62

02:03:14.000 --> 02:03:16.000
it's nice to see you 62

02:03:16.000 --> 02:03:18.000
um

02:03:18.000 --> 02:03:20.000
but yes um

02:03:20.000 --> 02:03:22.000
so people

02:03:22.000 --> 02:03:24.000
from an outside perspective think

02:03:24.000 --> 02:03:26.000
hypnosis

02:03:26.000 --> 02:03:28.000
um

02:03:28.000 --> 02:03:30.000
you don't do anything you don't want to do when it comes

02:03:30.000 --> 02:03:32.000
to hypnosis I am a full believer

02:03:32.000 --> 02:03:34.000
in that I absolutely do not

02:03:34.000 --> 02:03:36.000
think but because of the way

02:03:36.000 --> 02:03:38.000
it seemed comedically in the public eye

02:03:38.000 --> 02:03:40.000
like for example when

02:03:40.000 --> 02:03:42.000
a magician does hypnosis

02:03:42.000 --> 02:03:44.000
oh look they made this person

02:03:44.000 --> 02:03:46.000
drink a bottle of vinegar

02:03:46.000 --> 02:03:48.000
type thing um because

02:03:48.000 --> 02:03:50.000
it's seen that way publicly when the

02:03:50.000 --> 02:03:52.000
reality is when you participate

02:03:52.000 --> 02:03:54.000
in an alternative context

02:03:54.000 --> 02:03:56.000
you do not do anything you don't

02:03:56.000 --> 02:03:58.000
want to do this is a fact

02:03:58.000 --> 02:04:00.000
it's just how it works

02:04:00.000 --> 02:04:02.000
you like people

02:04:02.000 --> 02:04:04.000
seem to think like you completely just

02:04:04.000 --> 02:04:06.000
like oh you're inhibitions

02:04:06.000 --> 02:04:08.000
you can't control anything you're so

02:04:08.000 --> 02:04:10.000
like no mother

02:04:10.000 --> 02:04:12.000
that's not how it is

02:04:14.000 --> 02:04:16.000
all reeflings pull together and put a money

02:04:16.000 --> 02:04:18.000
in a oh should we buy

02:04:18.000 --> 02:04:20.000
a castle

02:04:20.000 --> 02:04:22.000
should we where should we

02:04:22.000 --> 02:04:24.000
what country though I want

02:04:24.000 --> 02:04:26.000
to say a castle in Scotland but um

02:04:26.000 --> 02:04:28.000
it's very hard to although

02:04:28.000 --> 02:04:30.000
saying that if we had a green

02:04:30.000 --> 02:04:32.000
glass house a greenhouse

02:04:32.000 --> 02:04:34.000
then we could have tons of

02:04:34.000 --> 02:04:36.000
um produce

02:04:36.000 --> 02:04:38.000
maybe we should get a castle in

02:04:38.000 --> 02:04:40.000
Scotland

02:04:40.000 --> 02:04:42.000
and then we can have a big garden

02:04:42.000 --> 02:04:44.000
and we have like we feast on the meals

02:04:44.000 --> 02:04:46.000
every night and we can try and make

02:04:46.000 --> 02:04:48.000
me for the first time

02:04:50.000 --> 02:04:52.000
black rock van garden

02:04:54.000 --> 02:04:56.000
those are the names quick tooth

02:04:56.000 --> 02:04:58.000
um squiddle kingdom

02:04:58.000 --> 02:05:00.000
anyway if I can't get a span because I've started

02:05:00.000 --> 02:05:02.000
talking about black rock it's been a good run

02:05:02.000 --> 02:05:04.000
yeah make sure you support the girls

02:05:04.000 --> 02:05:06.000
all hail our overlords

02:05:06.000 --> 02:05:08.000
um

02:05:08.000 --> 02:05:10.000
yes um

02:05:10.000 --> 02:05:12.000
we can try and learn to make me

02:05:12.000 --> 02:05:14.000
but I feel like I'd poison everyone

02:05:14.000 --> 02:05:16.000
if I did it

02:05:16.000 --> 02:05:18.000
oooh someone just leveled up

02:05:18.000 --> 02:05:20.000
congrats

02:05:20.000 --> 02:05:22.000
15.8

02:05:22.000 --> 02:05:24.000
did that go off I thought it was 15.3

02:05:24.000 --> 02:05:26.000
I was hoping it was going to go down

02:05:26.000 --> 02:05:28.000
it was fun

02:05:28.000 --> 02:05:30.000
it was fun while I lasted it was

02:05:30.000 --> 02:05:32.000
let's go castle with a farm

02:05:32.000 --> 02:05:34.000
could you imagine

02:05:34.000 --> 02:05:36.000
we all have our little bedroom and stuff

02:05:36.000 --> 02:05:38.000
and then when we need gen 2 to be made

02:05:38.000 --> 02:05:40.000
we just turn the lights off

02:05:40.000 --> 02:05:42.000
and see what happens

02:05:42.000 --> 02:05:44.000
hehehe

02:05:44.000 --> 02:05:46.000
mmm

02:05:46.000 --> 02:05:48.000
I just want to say some things

02:05:48.000 --> 02:05:50.000
but I refuse to say it

02:05:50.000 --> 02:05:52.000
that might get you banned

02:05:52.000 --> 02:05:54.000
shove it in my marshmallow then

02:05:54.000 --> 02:05:56.000
show me what I want to see

02:05:56.000 --> 02:05:58.000
mmm

02:06:00.000 --> 02:06:02.000
I want to cultivate

02:06:02.000 --> 02:06:04.000
tea

02:06:04.000 --> 02:06:06.000
oh my gosh and I can make honey tea for everyone

02:06:08.000 --> 02:06:10.000

and you guys can make me my special honey tea

02:06:14.000 --> 02:06:16.000

02:06:16.000 --> 02:06:18.000
and then there's special reefling honey tea

02:06:18.000 --> 02:06:20.000
I need special reefling honey tea

02:06:20.000 --> 02:06:22.000

02:06:56.000 --> 02:06:58.000

02:07:12.000 --> 02:07:14.000
where I need my special honey tea

02:07:16.000 --> 02:07:18.000
oh my god yes

02:07:18.000 --> 02:07:20.000
I'm in February

02:07:20.000 --> 02:07:22.000
I know February is so far away

02:07:22.000 --> 02:07:24.000
but I actually have a meta audio role play

02:07:24.000 --> 02:07:26.000
month as well

02:07:26.000 --> 02:07:28.000
but yeah I'll make it my missing thing

02:07:32.000 --> 02:07:34.000
I do want to care for a little garden

02:07:34.000 --> 02:07:36.000
yes so

02:07:36.000 --> 02:07:38.000
there's a lot of hardy plants

02:07:38.000 --> 02:07:40.000
so hardy plants are considered plants that can

02:07:40.000 --> 02:07:42.000
tolerate close to frost

02:07:42.000 --> 02:07:44.000
or very low temperatures

02:07:44.000 --> 02:07:46.000
these hardy plants

02:07:46.000 --> 02:07:48.000
are things such as potatoes

02:07:48.000 --> 02:07:50.000
leeks

02:07:50.000 --> 02:07:52.000
these root vegetable type things

02:07:52.000 --> 02:07:54.000
what's another root vegetable

02:07:54.000 --> 02:07:56.000
turnip very big

02:07:56.000 --> 02:07:58.000
neeps and tatties

02:07:58.000 --> 02:08:00.000
is turnips and potatoes

02:08:00.000 --> 02:08:02.000
these are very successful

02:08:02.000 --> 02:08:04.000
hardy plants in Scotland

02:08:04.000 --> 02:08:06.000
so these are probably what we'll focus on

02:08:06.000 --> 02:08:08.000
and make up the main majority

02:08:08.000 --> 02:08:10.000
berries

02:08:10.000 --> 02:08:12.000
strawberries

02:08:12.000 --> 02:08:14.000
and blackberries for example

02:08:14.000 --> 02:08:16.000
these berries are actually

02:08:16.000 --> 02:08:18.000
quite successful in Scotland

02:08:18.000 --> 02:08:20.000
against all odds

02:08:20.000 --> 02:08:22.000
because

02:08:22.000 --> 02:08:24.000
they're quite resistant

02:08:24.000 --> 02:08:26.000
which is really quite fascinating

02:08:26.000 --> 02:08:28.000
there's a lot of

02:08:28.000 --> 02:08:30.000
strawberry production and manufacturers

02:08:30.000 --> 02:08:32.000
in Scotland if you didn't know that

02:08:32.000 --> 02:08:34.000
a little fun factoid

02:08:36.000 --> 02:08:38.000
potatoes

02:08:38.000 --> 02:08:40.000
boil and mash them stick them in a stew

02:08:40.000 --> 02:08:42.000
and we make a big dinner

02:08:42.000 --> 02:08:44.000
and we have nice yummy dinners every night

02:08:44.000 --> 02:08:46.000
a carrots

02:08:46.000 --> 02:08:48.000
yes carrots

02:08:48.000 --> 02:08:50.000
fantastic example a ground vegetable

02:08:50.000 --> 02:08:52.000
yes yes yes

02:08:54.000 --> 02:08:56.000
wow

02:08:56.000 --> 02:08:58.000
9.4

02:08:58.000 --> 02:09:00.000
about to hit 9.3

02:09:00.000 --> 02:09:02.000
about to hit 8

02:09:02.000 --> 02:09:04.000
we're getting so close

02:09:04.000 --> 02:09:06.000
gollum would be fuming right now

02:09:06.000 --> 02:09:08.000
leeks are a winter crop

02:09:08.000 --> 02:09:10.000
yes

02:09:10.000 --> 02:09:12.000
and we can also have garlic

02:09:12.000 --> 02:09:14.000
we teach you about the drying process

02:09:14.000 --> 02:09:16.000
of garlic as well

02:09:16.000 --> 02:09:18.000
but we would need a shed for that

02:09:18.000 --> 02:09:20.000
surely one of us reeflings

02:09:20.000 --> 02:09:22.000
or DIY can make a shed

02:09:22.000 --> 02:09:24.000
although oh my god

02:09:24.000 --> 02:09:26.000
we're getting two steps away from being Amish

02:09:26.000 --> 02:09:28.000
at this rate I'm not even being funny

02:09:28.000 --> 02:09:30.000
because the Amish are known

02:09:30.000 --> 02:09:32.000
for building stuff really fast

02:09:34.000 --> 02:09:36.000
but I'm sure if all of us reeflings

02:09:36.000 --> 02:09:38.000
came together on the castle farm

02:09:38.000 --> 02:09:40.000
we could build a shed

02:09:40.000 --> 02:09:42.000
we could teach you all about garlic

02:09:44.000 --> 02:09:46.000
you need to dry out the garlic

02:09:46.000 --> 02:09:48.000
because if it's wet it will rot

02:09:48.000 --> 02:09:50.000
but if you dry it out successfully

02:09:50.000 --> 02:09:52.000
the garlic will last an entire year

02:09:52.000 --> 02:09:54.000
from harvest season to the next

02:09:54.000 --> 02:09:56.000
it will last an entire year

02:09:56.000 --> 02:09:58.000
absolutely fantastic

02:09:58.000 --> 02:10:00.000
and we need to get massive freezers

02:10:00.000 --> 02:10:02.000
to freeze all our produce

02:10:02.000 --> 02:10:04.000
so we can do massive meal preparation as well

02:10:04.000 --> 02:10:06.000
how big of a shed are we talking

02:10:06.000 --> 02:10:08.000
it would need to be decent

02:10:08.000 --> 02:10:10.000
I'm too scared to learn about canning food

02:10:10.000 --> 02:10:12.000
because I've heard about

02:10:12.000 --> 02:10:14.000
it literally perishes people

02:10:14.000 --> 02:10:16.000
if you mess up the canning process

02:10:16.000 --> 02:10:18.000
however there's one process

02:10:18.000 --> 02:10:20.000
I really like and it's

02:10:20.000 --> 02:10:22.000
D

02:10:22.000 --> 02:10:24.000
dehydrated food

02:10:24.000 --> 02:10:26.000
so you're left with the dry

02:10:26.000 --> 02:10:28.000
husk of the food

02:10:28.000 --> 02:10:30.000
basically but I trust that

02:10:30.000 --> 02:10:32.000
and apparently that stuff

02:10:32.000 --> 02:10:34.000
lasts 20 freaking years

02:10:34.000 --> 02:10:36.000
if you put it away right

02:10:36.000 --> 02:10:38.000
dehydrating food lasts 20 years

02:10:38.000 --> 02:10:40.000
I'm like

02:10:40.000 --> 02:10:42.000
oh my god

02:10:42.000 --> 02:10:44.000
I'm like

02:10:44.000 --> 02:10:46.000
this is just me being a weirdo

02:10:46.000 --> 02:10:48.000
I absolutely love the idea

02:10:48.000 --> 02:10:50.000
of a zombie apocalypse

02:10:50.000 --> 02:10:52.000
don't get me wrong I will perish within the first few days

02:10:52.000 --> 02:10:54.000
I will be bitten

02:10:54.000 --> 02:10:56.000
I'm sorry I'll just admit it there's no way

02:10:56.000 --> 02:10:58.000
I'm not that good

02:10:58.000 --> 02:11:00.000
trust me I'm not that guy

02:11:00.000 --> 02:11:02.000
but I really like the idea

02:11:02.000 --> 02:11:04.000
of having food reserves

02:11:04.000 --> 02:11:06.000
and like

02:11:06.000 --> 02:11:08.000
I think they're called a bug out bag

02:11:08.000 --> 02:11:10.000
yes a bug out bag

02:11:12.000 --> 02:11:14.000
I freaking love the idea

02:11:14.000 --> 02:11:16.000
of a bug out bag and all this

02:11:16.000 --> 02:11:18.000
food that's good to go

02:11:18.000 --> 02:11:20.000
is it MRE kits?

02:11:20.000 --> 02:11:22.000
I wouldn't mind trying an MRE kit

02:11:22.000 --> 02:11:24.000
taste testing stream that would be funny

02:11:24.000 --> 02:11:26.000
like a hand cam MRE thing

02:11:26.000 --> 02:11:28.000
that would be

02:11:28.000 --> 02:11:30.000
curious and then we can

02:11:30.000 --> 02:11:32.000
judge it from different places

02:11:32.000 --> 02:11:34.000
apparently South Korea has the yummiest

02:11:34.000 --> 02:11:36.000
MRE kits

02:11:36.000 --> 02:11:38.000
America has neutral

02:11:38.000 --> 02:11:40.000
I think UK is neutral

02:11:40.000 --> 02:11:42.000
maybe France might have something better

02:11:42.000 --> 02:11:44.000
MRE

02:11:44.000 --> 02:11:46.000
clogs your intestines oh no

02:11:46.000 --> 02:11:48.000
does it? I don't know

02:11:48.000 --> 02:11:50.000
oh like space food just add water

02:11:50.000 --> 02:11:52.000
yeah like space food

02:11:52.000 --> 02:11:54.000
we can try space food as well when we try the MRE kits

02:11:54.000 --> 02:11:56.000
rating MRE kits live cam

02:11:56.000 --> 02:11:58.000
I just rate it

02:11:58.000 --> 02:12:00.000
and then like say like a bunch of like

02:12:00.000 --> 02:12:02.000
stereotypical stuff about the nation that I'm

02:12:02.000 --> 02:12:04.000
waiting

02:12:04.000 --> 02:12:06.000
my life wouldn't change

02:12:06.000 --> 02:12:08.000
if a zombie apocalypse happens

02:12:08.000 --> 02:12:10.000
just close in the house

02:12:10.000 --> 02:12:12.000
if we're still in yeah I really

02:12:12.000 --> 02:12:14.000
like the idea of dehydrating

02:12:14.000 --> 02:12:16.000
food because it lasts

02:12:16.000 --> 02:12:18.000
years which is just a

02:12:18.000 --> 02:12:20.000
mind boggling thing to me like I absolutely

02:12:20.000 --> 02:12:22.000
love the concept of it

02:12:24.000 --> 02:12:26.000
I just find it so fascinating

02:12:26.000 --> 02:12:28.000
that we could preserve food like

02:12:28.000 --> 02:12:30.000
if you think of our ancestors

02:12:30.000 --> 02:12:32.000
who had to live on a yearly crop

02:12:32.000 --> 02:12:34.000
basis and like if your

02:12:34.000 --> 02:12:36.000
crops were messed up you were in

02:12:36.000 --> 02:12:38.000
trouble you had to find a trade quick

02:12:38.000 --> 02:12:40.000
like if you were a lumberjack

02:12:40.000 --> 02:12:42.000
and you cut wood or you sold

02:12:42.000 --> 02:12:44.000
I don't know you sold yourself

02:12:44.000 --> 02:12:46.000
but

02:12:46.000 --> 02:12:48.000
that trade really didn't

02:12:48.000 --> 02:12:50.000
still doing it today baby

02:12:50.000 --> 02:12:52.000
keeping my ancestors proud

02:12:52.000 --> 02:12:54.000
if they're

02:12:54.000 --> 02:12:56.000
lumber probably

02:12:56.000 --> 02:12:58.000
fire choppin probably

02:12:58.000 --> 02:13:00.000
root harvesting like harvesting

02:13:00.000 --> 02:13:02.000
mushrooms from a forest like if you knew

02:13:02.000 --> 02:13:04.000
what ones didn't hurt you

02:13:04.000 --> 02:13:06.000
it's like 4,800

02:13:06.000 --> 02:13:08.000
calories shoved into a box I wouldn't be

02:13:08.000 --> 02:13:10.000
surprised wait really maybe

02:13:10.000 --> 02:13:12.000
I should eat our MREs

02:13:12.000 --> 02:13:14.000
because I don't eat properly

02:13:14.000 --> 02:13:16.000
recently I've been really

02:13:16.000 --> 02:13:18.000
I don't know

02:13:18.000 --> 02:13:20.000
reflin reflin reflin

02:13:20.000 --> 02:13:22.000
do not tape

02:13:22.000 --> 02:13:24.000
doom

02:13:24.000 --> 02:13:26.000
do not tape doom

02:13:26.000 --> 02:13:28.000
I will talk to you

02:13:28.000 --> 02:13:30.000
openly and honestly

02:13:30.000 --> 02:13:32.000
I've been struggling to eat a little

02:13:32.000 --> 02:13:34.000
bit until things settle

02:13:34.000 --> 02:13:36.000
down

02:13:36.000 --> 02:13:38.000
I'm very happy to say my A-bomb

02:13:38.000 --> 02:13:40.000
has calmed down

02:13:40.000 --> 02:13:42.000
it has calmed down

02:13:42.000 --> 02:13:44.000
it was preventing me from eating properly

02:13:44.000 --> 02:13:46.000
basically

02:13:46.000 --> 02:13:48.000
I could start eating

02:13:48.000 --> 02:13:50.000
but then I got adrenaline burst

02:13:50.000 --> 02:13:52.000
which stops me from eating

02:13:52.000 --> 02:13:54.000
I'm not hungry when I get adrenaline burst

02:13:54.000 --> 02:13:56.000
but I'm very thankful to say

02:13:56.000 --> 02:13:58.000
it is subsiding

02:13:58.000 --> 02:14:00.000
I've managed to eat a bit better recently

02:14:00.000 --> 02:14:02.000
but no doom

02:14:02.000 --> 02:14:04.000
no doom

02:14:04.000 --> 02:14:06.000
okay

02:14:06.000 --> 02:14:08.000
9.2

02:14:08.000 --> 02:14:10.000
we're doing it

02:14:10.000 --> 02:14:12.000
the stack is going to be gone by the end of the stream

02:14:12.000 --> 02:14:14.000
mark my words

02:14:14.000 --> 02:14:16.000
you keep activating our worry mode which is why

02:14:18.000 --> 02:14:20.000
what level are you now

02:14:20.000 --> 02:14:22.000
level 62

02:14:22.000 --> 02:14:24.000
62 which is fantastic

02:14:24.000 --> 02:14:26.000
no doom here

02:14:26.000 --> 02:14:28.000
we're only winning glad to hear you're eating

02:14:28.000 --> 02:14:30.000
but yes and I think

02:14:30.000 --> 02:14:32.000
because now the girls are getting monetized

02:14:32.000 --> 02:14:34.000
I feel a lot of relief

02:14:34.000 --> 02:14:36.000
a lot of

02:14:36.000 --> 02:14:38.000
like all of it off my shoulders

02:14:38.000 --> 02:14:40.000
because I was worried

02:14:40.000 --> 02:14:42.000
that the designs that I had given

02:14:42.000 --> 02:14:44.000
Shibi and Azura are going to prevent them

02:14:44.000 --> 02:14:46.000
from earning money for a month

02:14:46.000 --> 02:14:48.000
but it's not happening

02:14:48.000 --> 02:14:50.000
I'm so happy to say it's not happening

02:14:50.000 --> 02:14:52.000
because Shibi got monetized

02:14:52.000 --> 02:14:54.000
which is absolutely fantastic

02:14:54.000 --> 02:14:56.000
truly fantastic

02:14:58.000 --> 02:15:00.000
I am very happy about that

02:15:00.000 --> 02:15:02.000
please take care of yourself

02:15:02.000 --> 02:15:04.000
yes I am doing fine

02:15:04.000 --> 02:15:06.000
still feels like doom stop it

02:15:06.000 --> 02:15:08.000
reflying stop it no doom

02:15:08.000 --> 02:15:10.000
it was because I was so worried

02:15:10.000 --> 02:15:12.000
about monetization

02:15:12.000 --> 02:15:14.000
because the girls

02:15:14.000 --> 02:15:16.000
um

02:15:16.000 --> 02:15:18.000
I've kind of said it a lot of them

02:15:18.000 --> 02:15:20.000
are wanting to move out

02:15:20.000 --> 02:15:22.000
and I think it's

02:15:22.000 --> 02:15:24.000
actually very possible

02:15:24.000 --> 02:15:26.000
after the first month

02:15:26.000 --> 02:15:28.000
but we needed youtube monetization

02:15:28.000 --> 02:15:30.000
just to really elevate it

02:15:30.000 --> 02:15:32.000
because and the thing

02:15:32.000 --> 02:15:34.000
with youtube monetization as well

02:15:34.000 --> 02:15:36.000
is that the vods can be

02:15:36.000 --> 02:15:38.000
the vods

02:15:38.000 --> 02:15:40.000
the streams like if someone watches back the stream

02:15:40.000 --> 02:15:42.000
well the girls get

02:15:42.000 --> 02:15:44.000
some of the money from the ads as well

02:15:44.000 --> 02:15:46.000
so it's like generated free income

02:15:46.000 --> 02:15:48.000
you do not have to actually physically

02:15:48.000 --> 02:15:50.000
you know hand over money to the girls

02:15:50.000 --> 02:15:52.000
because

02:15:52.000 --> 02:15:54.000
you generate money for free

02:15:54.000 --> 02:15:56.000
watching their asmr's

02:15:56.000 --> 02:15:58.000
their asmr's are going to go up shortly

02:15:58.000 --> 02:16:00.000
and I forgot to do mercies I'll need to give mercies her

02:16:00.000 --> 02:16:02.000
so that's what I'm doing

02:16:02.000 --> 02:16:04.000
I'll put emmy and aces membership live

02:16:04.000 --> 02:16:06.000
and I'll put mercies meme video unlisted

02:16:06.000 --> 02:16:08.000
so she can upload it whenever she desires

02:16:08.000 --> 02:16:10.000
and I'm gonna doom

02:16:10.000 --> 02:16:12.000
no

02:16:12.000 --> 02:16:14.000
no don't doom

02:16:16.000 --> 02:16:18.000
how about a tiny speck of doom

02:16:18.000 --> 02:16:20.000
why would you doom

02:16:20.000 --> 02:16:22.000
everything is going so well the girls are getting monetized

02:16:22.000 --> 02:16:24.000
emmy and aces

02:16:24.000 --> 02:16:26.000
are about to do their celebration

02:16:26.000 --> 02:16:28.000
mercies celebration was fantastic

02:16:28.000 --> 02:16:30.000
someone was gifting her 50 bombs

02:16:30.000 --> 02:16:32.000
which was insane

02:16:32.000 --> 02:16:34.000
no doom in on main

02:16:34.000 --> 02:16:36.000
literally no doom in on main

02:16:36.000 --> 02:16:38.000
like everything

02:16:38.000 --> 02:16:40.000
is just going so fantastic

02:16:40.000 --> 02:16:42.000
like I tweeted out like thank you for 5k

02:16:42.000 --> 02:16:44.000
and I was saying like all that

02:16:44.000 --> 02:16:46.000
self doubt and everything is just

02:16:46.000 --> 02:16:48.000
melting away overnight which is true it has

02:16:48.000 --> 02:16:50.000
like

02:16:50.000 --> 02:16:52.000
generate money for free

02:16:52.000 --> 02:16:54.000
yes oh my god

02:16:54.000 --> 02:16:56.000
please don't ever feel bad if you can't

02:16:56.000 --> 02:16:58.000
genuinely like give money you don't understand

02:16:58.000 --> 02:17:00.000
like you interacting with posts

02:17:00.000 --> 02:17:02.000
you're promoting them more in the algorithm

02:17:02.000 --> 02:17:04.000
em

02:17:04.000 --> 02:17:06.000
you're watching their asmr

02:17:06.000 --> 02:17:08.000
you're watching ads that goes to the money

02:17:08.000 --> 02:17:10.000
the girl gets money for that

02:17:10.000 --> 02:17:12.000
em like

02:17:12.000 --> 02:17:14.000
please don't ever worry

02:17:14.000 --> 02:17:16.000
if you can't hand over money

02:17:16.000 --> 02:17:18.000
that's why I always say

02:17:18.000 --> 02:17:20.000
oh I'm always streaming for free

02:17:20.000 --> 02:17:22.000
you don't have to be a member

02:17:22.000 --> 02:17:24.000
like the membership stream start up next week

02:17:24.000 --> 02:17:26.000
but you don't have to be a member to consume at all

02:17:26.000 --> 02:17:28.000
em

02:17:28.000 --> 02:17:30.000
type thingy

02:17:30.000 --> 02:17:32.000
I care about you and the girls too much

02:17:32.000 --> 02:17:34.000
I'm always gonna worry

02:17:34.000 --> 02:17:36.000
I was worrying over them I was like

02:17:36.000 --> 02:17:38.000
full mummy mode

02:17:38.000 --> 02:17:40.000
thankfully I got an 8 hour

02:17:40.000 --> 02:17:42.000
sleep last night

02:17:42.000 --> 02:17:44.000
oh my god

02:17:44.000 --> 02:17:46.000
it's why

02:17:46.000 --> 02:17:48.000
I probably sound a bit tired

02:17:48.000 --> 02:17:50.000
I woke up at the last

02:17:50.000 --> 02:17:52.000
possible minute for stream

02:17:52.000 --> 02:17:54.000
not because I don't love you because you guys

02:17:54.000 --> 02:17:56.000
always go oh mummy's late she doesn't love us

02:17:56.000 --> 02:17:58.000
anymore no

02:17:58.000 --> 02:18:00.000
I took medicine to

02:18:00.000 --> 02:18:02.000
put my ass to sleep

02:18:02.000 --> 02:18:04.000
and I got a full 8 hours

02:18:04.000 --> 02:18:06.000
and I'm so freaking glad I got a full 8 hours

02:18:06.000 --> 02:18:08.000
I'm like oh I feel so good

02:18:08.000 --> 02:18:10.000
it feels so good to get

02:18:10.000 --> 02:18:12.000
a full 8 hours of sleep

02:18:12.000 --> 02:18:14.000
em

02:18:14.000 --> 02:18:16.000
but yeah mummy loves us

02:18:16.000 --> 02:18:18.000
is the mercy meme video

02:18:18.000 --> 02:18:20.000
be a problem did youtube

02:18:20.000 --> 02:18:22.000
unlist it no it's not out yet

02:18:22.000 --> 02:18:24.000
I need to upload it to her channel

02:18:24.000 --> 02:18:26.000
because I subtitled all the

02:18:26.000 --> 02:18:28.000
meme videos

02:18:28.000 --> 02:18:30.000
em

02:18:30.000 --> 02:18:32.000
63

02:18:32.000 --> 02:18:34.000
63

02:18:34.000 --> 02:18:36.000
edgeville bank

02:18:36.000 --> 02:18:38.000
that was to the theme of 64 zoo lane

02:18:38.000 --> 02:18:40.000
which is a british tv

02:18:40.000 --> 02:18:42.000
show or it was

02:18:42.000 --> 02:18:44.000
I don't know if they make new episodes

02:18:44.000 --> 02:18:46.000
but yeah

02:18:46.000 --> 02:18:48.000
so if we like commenting streams

02:18:48.000 --> 02:18:50.000
that helps yeah it helps

02:18:50.000 --> 02:18:52.000
like immensely like

02:18:52.000 --> 02:18:54.000
so to give you an example

02:18:56.000 --> 02:18:58.000
ic does an asmr stream

02:18:58.000 --> 02:19:00.000
you like

02:19:00.000 --> 02:19:02.000
that stream and then emmy

02:19:02.000 --> 02:19:04.000
does an asmr stream you like that stream

02:19:04.000 --> 02:19:06.000
youtube goes youtube

02:19:06.000 --> 02:19:08.000
algorithm goes hmm there's

02:19:08.000 --> 02:19:10.000
a connection between these two girls

02:19:10.000 --> 02:19:12.000
they've both done asmr and this viewer

02:19:12.000 --> 02:19:14.000
both enjoyed them to leave a like

02:19:14.000 --> 02:19:16.000
and then the

02:19:16.000 --> 02:19:18.000
algorithm goes hmm

02:19:18.000 --> 02:19:20.000
this other youtube

02:19:20.000 --> 02:19:22.000
user both enjoyed these two

02:19:22.000 --> 02:19:24.000
girls I'm going to start

02:19:24.000 --> 02:19:26.000
recommending this user

02:19:26.000 --> 02:19:28.000
these girls

02:19:28.000 --> 02:19:30.000
and then it's kind of a knock on effect

02:19:30.000 --> 02:19:32.000
so

02:19:32.000 --> 02:19:34.000
em youtube

02:19:34.000 --> 02:19:36.000
will recommend

02:19:36.000 --> 02:19:38.000
someone who's never consumed ic's asmr

02:19:38.000 --> 02:19:40.000
before because they liked

02:19:40.000 --> 02:19:42.000
emmy's asmr

02:19:42.000 --> 02:19:44.000
and then that also goes

02:19:44.000 --> 02:19:46.000
further ahead to other vtuber asmr

02:19:46.000 --> 02:19:48.000
is for example the algorithm

02:19:48.000 --> 02:19:50.000
is like an insane

02:19:50.000 --> 02:19:52.000
tangled spider web

02:19:52.000 --> 02:19:54.000
of a mess

02:19:54.000 --> 02:19:56.000
and anything you do

02:19:56.000 --> 02:19:58.000
will affect it so

02:19:58.000 --> 02:20:00.000
for example

02:20:00.000 --> 02:20:02.000
if you

02:20:02.000 --> 02:20:04.000
go on twitter right now and you type in

02:20:04.000 --> 02:20:06.000
emmybzu and it'll pop up her twitter

02:20:06.000 --> 02:20:08.000
you've just affected your algorithm

02:20:08.000 --> 02:20:10.000
on youtube because unfortunately

02:20:10.000 --> 02:20:12.000
em websites

02:20:12.000 --> 02:20:14.000
completely cross platform everything

02:20:14.000 --> 02:20:16.000
whatever you type in even

02:20:16.000 --> 02:20:18.000
if you go to rule 34

02:20:18.000 --> 02:20:20.000
and type in the girls name

02:20:20.000 --> 02:20:22.000
you will affect the

02:20:22.000 --> 02:20:24.000
results of your youtube browsing

02:20:24.000 --> 02:20:26.000
experience because

02:20:26.000 --> 02:20:28.000
of what you've typed in on other websites

02:20:28.000 --> 02:20:30.000
as well

02:20:30.000 --> 02:20:32.000
em

02:20:32.000 --> 02:20:34.000
it goes very deep

02:20:34.000 --> 02:20:36.000
but unfortunately your websites are

02:20:36.000 --> 02:20:38.000
all interconnected whether or not you want

02:20:38.000 --> 02:20:40.000
to whether or not you say

02:20:40.000 --> 02:20:42.000
no to cookies no to this

02:20:42.000 --> 02:20:44.000
they are connected it's undeniable

02:20:44.000 --> 02:20:46.000
em

02:20:46.000 --> 02:20:48.000
does youtube listen in the chat too

02:20:48.000 --> 02:20:50.000
so youtube will

02:20:50.000 --> 02:20:52.000
see you interacting

02:20:52.000 --> 02:20:54.000
with me on chat and it'll say

02:20:54.000 --> 02:20:56.000
this user like strony will

02:20:56.000 --> 02:20:58.000
funny enough this other

02:20:58.000 --> 02:21:00.000
vtuber is like

02:21:00.000 --> 02:21:02.000
strony I will recommend this person

02:21:02.000 --> 02:21:04.000
strony

02:21:04.000 --> 02:21:06.000
another version of strony type thing

02:21:06.000 --> 02:21:08.000
sorry I'm not very good with my words at the moment

02:21:08.000 --> 02:21:10.000
em

02:21:10.000 --> 02:21:12.000
we'll probably we'll get we'll do a

02:21:12.000 --> 02:21:14.000
tinkle and a refuel at the 3 hour mark

02:21:14.000 --> 02:21:16.000
em

02:21:16.000 --> 02:21:18.000
I'm definitely gonna make another tea and I'm gonna get some

02:21:18.000 --> 02:21:20.000
yummy snacks

02:21:20.000 --> 02:21:22.000
em

02:21:22.000 --> 02:21:24.000
I bought a nature valley bar

02:21:24.000 --> 02:21:26.000
and I'm like is that the worst snack to eat

02:21:26.000 --> 02:21:28.000
on stream there's just gonna be dust everywhere

02:21:28.000 --> 02:21:30.000
and you

02:21:30.000 --> 02:21:32.000
stop looking at me misspelling your name

02:21:32.000 --> 02:21:34.000
how can you not

02:21:34.000 --> 02:21:36.000
strony kittles

02:21:36.000 --> 02:21:38.000
strony

02:21:38.000 --> 02:21:40.000
kittles

02:21:40.000 --> 02:21:42.000
strony cuttles

02:21:42.000 --> 02:21:44.000
how can you spell it wrong

02:21:44.000 --> 02:21:46.000
but yeah like literally if you

02:21:46.000 --> 02:21:48.000
go on twitter

02:21:48.000 --> 02:21:50.000
and you search

02:21:50.000 --> 02:21:52.000
vealour

02:21:52.000 --> 02:21:54.000
again you're manipulating the algorithm

02:21:54.000 --> 02:21:56.000
when you go on youtube odds are you'll probably

02:21:56.000 --> 02:21:58.000
have a few more vealour streams recommended

02:21:58.000 --> 02:22:00.000
to you on your page or down the side bar

02:22:00.000 --> 02:22:02.000
because

02:22:02.000 --> 02:22:04.000
the algorithm knows that you have an interest

02:22:04.000 --> 02:22:06.000
in vealour it's it's it goes so deep

02:22:06.000 --> 02:22:08.000
unfortunately cookies are just

02:22:08.000 --> 02:22:10.000
websites are such

02:22:10.000 --> 02:22:12.000
liars being like oh we don't track you

02:22:12.000 --> 02:22:14.000
via cookies only the essential ones

02:22:14.000 --> 02:22:16.000
you liar

02:22:16.000 --> 02:22:18.000
you liar it's just the way the internet is

02:22:18.000 --> 02:22:20.000
these days we're just such shame

02:22:20.000 --> 02:22:22.000
for the last

02:22:22.000 --> 02:22:24.000
week I've been getting ads

02:22:24.000 --> 02:22:26.000
regarding the Scotland

02:22:26.000 --> 02:22:28.000
honestly

02:22:28.000 --> 02:22:30.000
come visit Scotland

02:22:30.000 --> 02:22:32.000
Scotland tourism

02:22:32.000 --> 02:22:34.000
industry come to

02:22:34.000 --> 02:22:36.000
Edmund

02:22:36.000 --> 02:22:38.000
actually I think Edmund is the most

02:22:38.000 --> 02:22:40.000
more expensive than Glasgow although it's

02:22:40.000 --> 02:22:42.000
probably

02:22:42.000 --> 02:22:44.000
a small amount of

02:22:44.000 --> 02:22:46.000
different so if we're watching like

02:22:46.000 --> 02:22:48.000
Scottish VTubers we should get

02:22:48.000 --> 02:22:50.000
more Scottish VTubers

02:22:50.000 --> 02:22:52.000
I actually don't know about

02:22:52.000 --> 02:22:54.000
getting they're like

02:22:54.000 --> 02:22:56.000
super rare I'ma just say this

02:22:56.000 --> 02:22:58.000
on behalf of all Scottish VTubers

02:22:58.000 --> 02:23:00.000
right now a lot has to go wrong

02:23:00.000 --> 02:23:02.000
in your life in order to become

02:23:02.000 --> 02:23:04.000
a Scottish VTuber

02:23:04.000 --> 02:23:06.000
now to become a VTuber in general

02:23:06.000 --> 02:23:08.000
that's perfectly normal if you're any other

02:23:08.000 --> 02:23:10.000
nationality if you're Scottish

02:23:10.000 --> 02:23:12.000
and a VTuber

02:23:12.000 --> 02:23:14.000
bruh whatever happened in your life

02:23:14.000 --> 02:23:16.000
I feel for you hen so if you're a Scottish VTuber

02:23:16.000 --> 02:23:18.000
listening in I feel for you hen

02:23:18.000 --> 02:23:20.000
don't worry I went through it too

02:23:22.000 --> 02:23:24.000
you know

02:23:24.000 --> 02:23:26.000
I

02:23:26.000 --> 02:23:28.000
am only aware of two other

02:23:28.000 --> 02:23:30.000
Scottish VTubers

02:23:30.000 --> 02:23:32.000
unfortunately they are not

02:23:32.000 --> 02:23:34.000
for me content-wise

02:23:34.000 --> 02:23:36.000
definitely not for me

02:23:36.000 --> 02:23:38.000
but that's just my

02:23:38.000 --> 02:23:40.000
being me

02:23:40.000 --> 02:23:42.000
definitely not on the same page

02:23:42.000 --> 02:23:44.000
when it comes to

02:23:44.000 --> 02:23:46.000
thought process

02:23:46.000 --> 02:23:48.000
or like

02:23:48.000 --> 02:23:50.000
how we were raised and all that

02:23:50.000 --> 02:23:52.000
you can kinda tell when you

02:23:52.000 --> 02:23:54.000
hear someone talk

02:23:54.000 --> 02:23:56.000
you can kinda tell the way they've been raised

02:23:56.000 --> 02:23:58.000
in Scotland which sounds terrible

02:23:58.000 --> 02:24:00.000
sounds almost classic so I'm not trying

02:24:00.000 --> 02:24:02.000
to be like that I'm just trying to be like

02:24:04.000 --> 02:24:06.000
I don't know you can

02:24:06.000 --> 02:24:08.000
you can tell when someone doesn't

02:24:08.000 --> 02:24:10.000
gear and then you can tell when someone

02:24:10.000 --> 02:24:12.000
geyser and I

02:24:12.000 --> 02:24:14.000
much better with people who didn't geyser

02:24:14.000 --> 02:24:16.000
you know

02:24:16.000 --> 02:24:18.000
so how do I infect other people's

02:24:18.000 --> 02:24:20.000
algorithm

02:24:20.000 --> 02:24:22.000
I suppose

02:24:22.000 --> 02:24:24.000
the only way you can do it

02:24:24.000 --> 02:24:26.000
oh we're almost at 8k

02:24:26.000 --> 02:24:28.000
is

02:24:28.000 --> 02:24:30.000
by posting

02:24:30.000 --> 02:24:32.000
YouTube shorts in particular

02:24:32.000 --> 02:24:34.000
in locations where it's appropriate

02:24:34.000 --> 02:24:36.000
so just that you're in a general

02:24:36.000 --> 02:24:38.000
VTuber fan discord

02:24:38.000 --> 02:24:40.000
if someone were to watch that short

02:24:40.000 --> 02:24:42.000
fully

02:24:42.000 --> 02:24:44.000
you have successfully infected them

02:24:44.000 --> 02:24:46.000
algorithm-wise

02:24:46.000 --> 02:24:48.000
because

02:24:48.000 --> 02:24:50.000
they consume that content

02:24:50.000 --> 02:24:52.000
it's fascinating

02:24:52.000 --> 02:24:54.000
and honestly I actually am quite interested

02:24:54.000 --> 02:24:56.000
in the infection side of it

02:24:56.000 --> 02:24:58.000
but yes you can successfully

02:24:58.000 --> 02:25:00.000
infect someone with the veiler virus

02:25:04.000 --> 02:25:06.000
I am

02:25:08.000 --> 02:25:10.000
sorry I just read that comment

02:25:10.000 --> 02:25:12.000
yes you can infect someone

02:25:12.000 --> 02:25:14.000
by doing that if they have never consumed

02:25:14.000 --> 02:25:16.000
veiler content

02:25:16.000 --> 02:25:18.000
but you

02:25:18.000 --> 02:25:20.000
maybe make clips of the girls and they click it

02:25:20.000 --> 02:25:22.000
for the first time because they got recommended

02:25:22.000 --> 02:25:24.000
or you post in a discord that's appropriate

02:25:24.000 --> 02:25:26.000
to post the VTuber stuff

02:25:26.000 --> 02:25:28.000
or maybe a VTuber read it

02:25:28.000 --> 02:25:30.000
actually they're

02:25:30.000 --> 02:25:32.000
I think there's

02:25:32.000 --> 02:25:34.000
so

02:25:34.000 --> 02:25:36.000
veiler do have the veiler read it

02:25:36.000 --> 02:25:38.000
but it's not being publicly posted yet

02:25:38.000 --> 02:25:40.000
but I don't know

02:25:40.000 --> 02:25:42.000
I mean literally I was just going to put everyone's

02:25:42.000 --> 02:25:44.000
oh sorry

02:25:44.000 --> 02:25:46.000
this is why I can't talk and think at the same time

02:25:46.000 --> 02:25:48.000
there is a possibility

02:25:48.000 --> 02:25:50.000
of just posting it for memes

02:25:50.000 --> 02:25:52.000
but we were going to have to put it on approved posts

02:25:52.000 --> 02:25:54.000
only because it can get nasty

02:25:54.000 --> 02:25:56.000
pretty quickly

02:25:56.000 --> 02:25:58.000
and I do not want any of the girls

02:25:58.000 --> 02:26:00.000
to be subjected to anything

02:26:00.000 --> 02:26:02.000
nasty

02:26:02.000 --> 02:26:04.000
let's go infect some

02:26:04.000 --> 02:26:06.000
replays

02:26:06.000 --> 02:26:08.000
I have no idea what you're saying but I'll take your word for it

02:26:08.000 --> 02:26:10.000
thank you

02:26:10.000 --> 02:26:12.000
it's Edinburgh a bad place no it's not

02:26:12.000 --> 02:26:14.000
it's just more rich

02:26:14.000 --> 02:26:16.000
and

02:26:16.000 --> 02:26:18.000
sometimes rich people

02:26:18.000 --> 02:26:20.000
are not very empathetic

02:26:20.000 --> 02:26:22.000
but that was such a mean and nasty

02:26:22.000 --> 02:26:24.000
generalization

02:26:24.000 --> 02:26:26.000
when I say rich people I'm talking like

02:26:26.000 --> 02:26:28.000
multi-billionaires

02:26:28.000 --> 02:26:30.000
type stuff rich

02:26:30.000 --> 02:26:32.000
the average duo everyone's empathetic

02:26:32.000 --> 02:26:34.000
but if you're not very empathetic

02:26:34.000 --> 02:26:36.000
please don't worry I'm actually going to do an

02:26:36.000 --> 02:26:38.000
educational stream on human nature

02:26:38.000 --> 02:26:40.000
and empathy, empathy is a practice behaviour

02:26:40.000 --> 02:26:42.000
you need to practice empathy to get it

02:26:42.000 --> 02:26:44.000
you need to

02:26:44.000 --> 02:26:46.000
flip the switch

02:26:46.000 --> 02:26:48.000
and be able to have abstract thoughts

02:26:48.000 --> 02:26:50.000
about empathy as a whole

02:26:50.000 --> 02:26:52.000
and I'm actually going to challenge you guys

02:26:52.000 --> 02:26:54.000
and I'm going to

02:26:54.000 --> 02:26:56.000
make up scenarios where you need to be empathetic

02:26:56.000 --> 02:26:58.000
and you need to give me a reason

02:26:58.000 --> 02:27:00.000
why you feel empathetic

02:27:00.000 --> 02:27:02.000
but I'm going to make the scenarios super hard

02:27:02.000 --> 02:27:04.000
so at a glance you're like

02:27:04.000 --> 02:27:06.000
that's disgusting behaviour

02:27:08.000 --> 02:27:10.000
but

02:27:10.000 --> 02:27:12.000
we have to learn to be empathetic

02:27:12.000 --> 02:27:14.000
and we have to think about why

02:27:14.000 --> 02:27:16.000
the person may have behaved that way

02:27:18.000 --> 02:27:20.000
it'll be an interesting concept

02:27:20.000 --> 02:27:22.000
either the stream will go terrible and everyone can laugh at it

02:27:22.000 --> 02:27:24.000
which is fine I don't mind you guys

02:27:24.000 --> 02:27:26.000
or I'll have to laugh at my stream ideas

02:27:26.000 --> 02:27:28.000
because I have pretty bizarre concepts sometimes

02:27:30.000 --> 02:27:32.000
oh man we have a place like that too

02:27:32.000 --> 02:27:34.000
in Milan, never got Milan

02:27:34.000 --> 02:27:36.000
so it's like London but smaller and prettier

02:27:36.000 --> 02:27:38.000
it's pretty old, it's pretty old

02:27:38.000 --> 02:27:40.000
there's a lot of older architecture

02:27:40.000 --> 02:27:42.000
Edinburgh is turning people

02:27:42.000 --> 02:27:44.000
into an English city in regards to the most posh people

02:27:44.000 --> 02:27:46.000
I definitely feel more comfortable

02:27:46.000 --> 02:27:48.000
in Glasgow

02:27:48.000 --> 02:27:50.000
and good old Glasgow

02:27:50.000 --> 02:27:52.000
mutual comfy

02:27:52.000 --> 02:27:54.000
and then

02:27:54.000 --> 02:27:56.000
I'm going to pull the lever and make everything worse

02:27:56.000 --> 02:27:58.000
what does that mean

02:27:58.000 --> 02:28:00.000
the Scottish accents kind of come from

02:28:00.000 --> 02:28:02.000
wealth and class

02:28:02.000 --> 02:28:04.000
so the more slang

02:28:04.000 --> 02:28:06.000
you speak statistically

02:28:06.000 --> 02:28:08.000
the more polvo you are

02:28:08.000 --> 02:28:10.000
and it's completely normal to be

02:28:10.000 --> 02:28:12.000
in poverty in Scotland

02:28:12.000 --> 02:28:14.000
the statistics are 1 in 5

02:28:14.000 --> 02:28:16.000
children are growing up

02:28:16.000 --> 02:28:18.000
in poverty however

02:28:18.000 --> 02:28:20.000
I actually think the statistics

02:28:20.000 --> 02:28:22.000
are in 3 now

02:28:22.000 --> 02:28:24.000
so it's completely normal

02:28:24.000 --> 02:28:26.000
to be impoverished

02:28:26.000 --> 02:28:28.000
when you grow up

02:28:28.000 --> 02:28:30.000
it's absolutely nothing out of the ordinary

02:28:30.000 --> 02:28:32.000
no one's rich type idea

02:28:32.000 --> 02:28:34.000
I like that, I like human psychology

02:28:34.000 --> 02:28:36.000
that sounds pretty interesting

02:28:36.000 --> 02:28:38.000
are you trying to get us to empathise with some scoundrels

02:28:38.000 --> 02:28:40.000
no nothing bad

02:28:40.000 --> 02:28:42.000
but I want to

02:28:44.000 --> 02:28:46.000
oh no

02:28:46.000 --> 02:28:48.000
oh no the fire

02:28:48.000 --> 02:28:50.000
pick up the ashes

02:28:50.000 --> 02:28:52.000
I will clear it

02:28:52.000 --> 02:28:54.000
oh no you've already cleared the campsite for me

02:28:54.000 --> 02:28:56.000
thank you refling

02:28:56.000 --> 02:28:58.000
wow we're at 8.9

02:28:58.000 --> 02:29:00.000
we are getting through it

02:29:00.000 --> 02:29:02.000
oh look I burn

02:29:02.000 --> 02:29:04.000
you dancing

02:29:04.000 --> 02:29:06.000
who's dancing back there

02:29:06.000 --> 02:29:08.000
I burnt 98 lobsters

02:29:08.000 --> 02:29:10.000
because I had 500

02:29:10.000 --> 02:29:12.000
hold on

02:29:12.000 --> 02:29:14.000
thank you fire maker

02:29:14.000 --> 02:29:16.000
you're so on fire

02:29:16.000 --> 02:29:18.000
in hot hot hot

02:29:18.000 --> 02:29:20.000
in hot hot hot

02:29:20.000 --> 02:29:22.000
you so on fire

02:29:22.000 --> 02:29:24.000
anyway

02:29:24.000 --> 02:29:26.000
look at the drip, I forgot about my drip

02:29:26.000 --> 02:29:28.000
my goodness

02:29:28.000 --> 02:29:30.000
look at the eyes, that is hilarious

02:29:30.000 --> 02:29:32.000
that they're just blobs

02:29:32.000 --> 02:29:34.000
I love this game

02:29:34.000 --> 02:29:36.000
that's so good

02:29:36.000 --> 02:29:38.000
I heard a lot of good stuff about Glasgow

02:29:38.000 --> 02:29:40.000
firepaw, flames, yes

02:29:42.000 --> 02:29:44.000
it's currently British

02:29:44.000 --> 02:29:46.000
only a thing, wait sorry

02:29:46.000 --> 02:29:48.000
isn't current British English only a thing

02:29:48.000 --> 02:29:50.000
because they didn't want to be associated with the nobility of the plagues

02:29:50.000 --> 02:29:52.000
yes

02:29:52.000 --> 02:29:54.000
there is a very viral clip

02:29:54.000 --> 02:29:56.000
that a guy

02:29:56.000 --> 02:29:58.000
is being interviewed

02:29:58.000 --> 02:30:00.000
and

02:30:00.000 --> 02:30:02.000
oh god what was the word

02:30:02.000 --> 02:30:04.000
I can see the interview in my head

02:30:06.000 --> 02:30:08.000
it's an English interview

02:30:08.000 --> 02:30:10.000
and the guy speaks

02:30:10.000 --> 02:30:12.000
what we call posh English

02:30:12.000 --> 02:30:14.000
and then the guy replies

02:30:14.000 --> 02:30:16.000
tomorrow, that's it

02:30:16.000 --> 02:30:18.000
the guy goes like tomorrow

02:30:18.000 --> 02:30:20.000
and then the guy replies tomorrow

02:30:20.000 --> 02:30:22.000
and he's like not trying to

02:30:22.000 --> 02:30:24.000
correct him but he's trying to be like

02:30:24.000 --> 02:30:26.000
wow look at the difference in this

02:30:26.000 --> 02:30:28.000
regional accent

02:30:28.000 --> 02:30:30.000
but the problem

02:30:30.000 --> 02:30:32.000
with it, it's not that problematic

02:30:32.000 --> 02:30:34.000
relax before you're like well steady on

02:30:34.000 --> 02:30:36.000
you've got blue hair haven't you, nah relax

02:30:36.000 --> 02:30:38.000
I ain't got blue hair, can't I

02:30:38.000 --> 02:30:40.000
if anything I'm the opposite of you

02:30:40.000 --> 02:30:42.000
the kind of thing

02:30:42.000 --> 02:30:44.000
with it is because posh English

02:30:44.000 --> 02:30:46.000
accents are associated with wealth

02:30:46.000 --> 02:30:48.000
are associated with grammar

02:30:48.000 --> 02:30:50.000
schools for example, a grammar school

02:30:50.000 --> 02:30:52.000
is a rich person

02:30:52.000 --> 02:30:54.000
school, high education

02:30:54.000 --> 02:30:56.000
school, public education

02:30:56.000 --> 02:30:58.000
is kind of associated with

02:30:58.000 --> 02:31:00.000
not necessarily pro but if you can't

02:31:00.000 --> 02:31:02.000
afford public education

02:31:02.000 --> 02:31:04.000
you can't afford it

02:31:04.000 --> 02:31:06.000
so the guy was like

02:31:06.000 --> 02:31:08.000
look at this accent

02:31:08.000 --> 02:31:10.000
this man clearly

02:31:10.000 --> 02:31:12.000
you know, wasn't

02:31:12.000 --> 02:31:14.000
educated in a grammar school type thing

02:31:14.000 --> 02:31:16.000
and that's when it becomes a wee bit of an issue

02:31:16.000 --> 02:31:18.000
received

02:31:18.000 --> 02:31:20.000
pronunciation

02:31:22.000 --> 02:31:24.000
it's them also calling it the queen's English

02:31:24.000 --> 02:31:26.000
just finding out it's not

02:31:26.000 --> 02:31:28.000
Glasgow

02:31:28.000 --> 02:31:30.000
it's a shame

02:31:30.000 --> 02:31:32.000
it's fine if you accidentally

02:31:32.000 --> 02:31:34.000
name a city wrong like Edinburgh

02:31:34.000 --> 02:31:36.000
Edinburgh is normally

02:31:36.000 --> 02:31:38.000
pronounced Edinburgh

02:31:38.000 --> 02:31:40.000
by

02:31:40.000 --> 02:31:42.000
folk who don't come from here

02:31:42.000 --> 02:31:44.000
that's perfectly normal

02:31:44.000 --> 02:31:46.000
I'm sure I say all these locations

02:31:46.000 --> 02:31:48.000
in different countries wrong as well

02:31:48.000 --> 02:31:50.000
like Arkansas is Arkansas

02:31:50.000 --> 02:31:52.000
and like Mississippi

02:31:52.000 --> 02:31:54.000
and what's another state

02:31:54.000 --> 02:31:56.000
in America

02:31:56.000 --> 02:31:58.000
Rhode Island

02:31:58.000 --> 02:32:00.000
Colorado

02:32:00.000 --> 02:32:02.000
I'm sure I say it funny so please don't ever be embarrassed

02:32:02.000 --> 02:32:04.000
if you say it funny

02:32:04.000 --> 02:32:06.000
I always said Glasgow

02:32:06.000 --> 02:32:08.000
but in the regional dialect

02:32:08.000 --> 02:32:10.000
it can also be Glasgow

02:32:10.000 --> 02:32:12.000
don't ask why it's Glasgow

02:32:12.000 --> 02:32:14.000
it just is Glasgow

02:32:14.000 --> 02:32:16.000
Texas

02:32:16.000 --> 02:32:18.000
I'm sure I'll say

02:32:18.000 --> 02:32:20.000
I don't know if there's some locations

02:32:20.000 --> 02:32:22.000
in the states that I can name

02:32:24.000 --> 02:32:26.000
Anaheim is a place in

02:32:26.000 --> 02:32:28.000
California

02:32:28.000 --> 02:32:30.000
because they hold

02:32:30.000 --> 02:32:32.000
conventions

02:32:32.000 --> 02:32:34.000
I'm pretty sure there was some Anaheim convention

02:32:34.000 --> 02:32:36.000
at one point

02:32:36.000 --> 02:32:38.000
if I ever visit the UK I'll go to Glasgow

02:32:38.000 --> 02:32:40.000
honestly it's such a nice

02:32:40.000 --> 02:32:42.000
although Edinburgh is pretty good for

02:32:42.000 --> 02:32:44.000
tourist stuff like the Edinburgh Castle

02:32:44.000 --> 02:32:46.000
and the Edinburgh Museum

02:32:46.000 --> 02:32:48.000
are pretty close together

02:32:50.000 --> 02:32:52.000
did you say Wales is associated with

02:32:52.000 --> 02:32:54.000
Posh? No, Wales

02:32:54.000 --> 02:32:56.000
is associated

02:32:56.000 --> 02:32:58.000
with the mining towns and all of that

02:32:58.000 --> 02:33:00.000
and the

02:33:00.000 --> 02:33:02.000
Welsh accent

02:33:02.000 --> 02:33:04.000
I can't do

02:33:04.000 --> 02:33:06.000
what is the Welsh accent?

02:33:06.000 --> 02:33:08.000
I can't think of a Welsh

02:33:08.000 --> 02:33:10.000
sentence to say

02:33:10.000 --> 02:33:12.000
to start the accent

02:33:12.000 --> 02:33:14.000
a bit of coke

02:33:14.000 --> 02:33:16.000
and rum please

02:33:16.000 --> 02:33:18.000
the only example

02:33:18.000 --> 02:33:20.000
of Welsh accent I have

02:33:20.000 --> 02:33:22.000
is this little Britain

02:33:22.000 --> 02:33:24.000
skit where the guy's like

02:33:24.000 --> 02:33:26.000
I'm the only gay in the village

02:33:26.000 --> 02:33:28.000
because he was so proudful

02:33:28.000 --> 02:33:30.000
he'd be silly that guy's

02:33:30.000 --> 02:33:32.000
or that girl or that lass

02:33:32.000 --> 02:33:34.000
and he's like I'm the only gay in the village

02:33:34.000 --> 02:33:36.000
that's the only exposure to the

02:33:36.000 --> 02:33:38.000
Welsh accent to be honest

02:33:38.000 --> 02:33:40.000
which is absolutely terrible

02:33:40.000 --> 02:33:42.000
all of a sudden we're drifting up to the

02:33:42.000 --> 02:33:44.000
Northern Ireland

02:33:44.000 --> 02:33:46.000
Heavenly Father who art in heaven

02:33:46.000 --> 02:33:48.000
hallo to be thy name

02:33:48.000 --> 02:33:50.000
today we're gathered with the reeflings at Hedgerville

02:33:50.000 --> 02:33:52.000
we're currently cooking up a storm

02:33:52.000 --> 02:33:54.000
with swordfish but we still have a high

02:33:54.000 --> 02:33:56.000
burn rate

02:33:56.000 --> 02:33:58.000
100% now are you joking

02:33:58.000 --> 02:34:00.000
why is my burn rate getting higher

02:34:00.000 --> 02:34:02.000
I'm leveling up

02:34:02.000 --> 02:34:04.000
Wales is associated with sheep

02:34:04.000 --> 02:34:06.000
I will tell you

02:34:06.000 --> 02:34:08.000
the reason why Wales are associated with sheep

02:34:08.000 --> 02:34:10.000
it's illegal

02:34:10.000 --> 02:34:12.000
to steal a farmer's sheep

02:34:12.000 --> 02:34:14.000
it wasn't at the time

02:34:14.000 --> 02:34:16.000
many a year ago

02:34:16.000 --> 02:34:18.000
to have

02:34:18.000 --> 02:34:20.000
actions with the sheep

02:34:20.000 --> 02:34:22.000
which is why

02:34:22.000 --> 02:34:24.000
people would pretend

02:34:24.000 --> 02:34:26.000
that they had had

02:34:26.000 --> 02:34:28.000
action with a sheep

02:34:28.000 --> 02:34:30.000
instead of stealing it

02:34:30.000 --> 02:34:32.000
because you can't get arrested for actions

02:34:32.000 --> 02:34:34.000
but you could get arrested for stealing at the time

02:34:34.000 --> 02:34:36.000
okay that is why

02:34:36.000 --> 02:34:38.000
poor Welsh people

02:34:38.000 --> 02:34:40.000
have to deal with that stereotype

02:34:40.000 --> 02:34:42.000
and it's such a shame

02:34:42.000 --> 02:34:44.000
because it's not true

02:34:44.000 --> 02:34:46.000
you just need to know a little bit of history

02:34:46.000 --> 02:34:48.000
to understand a little bit more

02:34:48.000 --> 02:34:50.000
Aberdonians

02:34:50.000 --> 02:34:52.000
profusely sweating

02:34:52.000 --> 02:34:54.000
what is it

02:34:54.000 --> 02:34:56.000
Aberdeen

02:34:56.000 --> 02:34:58.000
absolutely short in behaviour

02:34:58.000 --> 02:35:00.000
stealing was the death penalty

02:35:00.000 --> 02:35:02.000
yes okay

02:35:02.000 --> 02:35:04.000
that would be it

02:35:04.000 --> 02:35:06.000
it was even more severe than I originally had anticipated

02:35:06.000 --> 02:35:08.000
I shan't be in Scottish

02:35:08.000 --> 02:35:10.000
I'm getting the football off

02:35:10.000 --> 02:35:12.000
I said

02:35:12.000 --> 02:35:14.000
oh my god sin I have bad news

02:35:14.000 --> 02:35:16.000
I might have to delay our collab

02:35:16.000 --> 02:35:18.000
into July

02:35:18.000 --> 02:35:20.000
because of work reasons

02:35:20.000 --> 02:35:22.000
and each of our agency reasons

02:35:22.000 --> 02:35:24.000
you'll have to forgive me but I do have my shock

02:35:24.000 --> 02:35:26.000
caller for it

02:35:26.000 --> 02:35:28.000
but you're going to have to give me some time

02:35:28.000 --> 02:35:30.000
I shan't be in Scottish

02:35:32.000 --> 02:35:34.000
we're level 64

02:35:34.000 --> 02:35:36.000
and we've got a total level of

02:35:36.000 --> 02:35:38.000
150, level 2000

02:35:38.000 --> 02:35:40.000
here we come

02:35:40.000 --> 02:35:42.000
I'm kidding we are not doing 2000

02:35:42.000 --> 02:35:44.000
there's no way

02:35:44.000 --> 02:35:46.000
I'm not even talking to you ever again

02:35:46.000 --> 02:35:48.000
sin I'm sorry

02:35:48.000 --> 02:35:50.000
I'm not freaking kidding

02:35:50.000 --> 02:35:52.000
um

02:35:52.000 --> 02:35:54.000
uh

02:35:54.000 --> 02:35:56.000
oh no

02:35:56.000 --> 02:35:58.000
I've just went in the discord

02:35:58.000 --> 02:36:00.000
someone's getting banned from someone

02:36:00.000 --> 02:36:02.000
everyone's chat for being annoying

02:36:02.000 --> 02:36:04.000
oh no

02:36:04.000 --> 02:36:06.000
reflans I hope it's not one of you

02:36:06.000 --> 02:36:08.000
someone's getting banned

02:36:10.000 --> 02:36:12.000
Shawnee had to reveal to me

02:36:12.000 --> 02:36:14.000
live in front of millions that she hates

02:36:14.000 --> 02:36:16.000
no what the heck you're such a reflans sin

02:36:16.000 --> 02:36:18.000
for saying that reflans are

02:36:18.000 --> 02:36:20.000
oh mummy hates me

02:36:20.000 --> 02:36:22.000
I need to delay until July okay

02:36:22.000 --> 02:36:24.000
give me till July

02:36:24.000 --> 02:36:26.000
give me July sin

02:36:26.000 --> 02:36:28.000
and then we can shock each other with callers

02:36:28.000 --> 02:36:30.000
do you have a heart rate monitor by the way

02:36:30.000 --> 02:36:32.000
I was going to wear my heart rate monitor so you can

02:36:32.000 --> 02:36:34.000
literally see my heart spike every time you go

02:36:36.000 --> 02:36:38.000
she hates me what if I die before

02:36:38.000 --> 02:36:40.000
you better not sin

02:36:40.000 --> 02:36:42.000
I'll be raging are you joking

02:36:42.000 --> 02:36:44.000
you've just got that 3d model and everything

02:36:44.000 --> 02:36:46.000
I honestly

02:36:46.000 --> 02:36:48.000
I love your 3d model streams

02:36:48.000 --> 02:36:50.000
I don't know how you're not exhausted by the end of it

02:36:50.000 --> 02:36:52.000
honestly I'd be shattered after like 30 seconds

02:36:52.000 --> 02:36:54.000
of moving around I'd be like right that's all

02:36:54.000 --> 02:36:56.000
I've got time for

02:36:56.000 --> 02:36:58.000
it's been nice reflans but I gotta go and rest

02:36:58.000 --> 02:37:00.000
I need to lie down

02:37:00.000 --> 02:37:02.000
I wore a shock collar for 10

02:37:02.000 --> 02:37:04.000
oh no I'm

02:37:04.000 --> 02:37:06.000
I'm not

02:37:06.000 --> 02:37:08.000
I don't even know how

02:37:08.000 --> 02:37:10.000
big we're gonna get it done

02:37:10.000 --> 02:37:12.000
sin

02:37:12.000 --> 02:37:14.000
sin will

02:37:14.000 --> 02:37:16.000
will always be a reflans

02:37:16.000 --> 02:37:18.000
did you

02:37:18.000 --> 02:37:20.000
kicked my toenail off the wall a few times

02:37:20.000 --> 02:37:22.000
oh no

02:37:22.000 --> 02:37:24.000
what

02:37:24.000 --> 02:37:26.000
what's your community name again

02:37:26.000 --> 02:37:28.000
because I remember when I

02:37:28.000 --> 02:37:30.000
when I saw you getting started

02:37:30.000 --> 02:37:32.000
it had been named something

02:37:32.000 --> 02:37:34.000
but I don't know

02:37:34.000 --> 02:37:36.000
if you're still named that and I don't want to say the name

02:37:36.000 --> 02:37:38.000
okay it's imps now

02:37:38.000 --> 02:37:40.000
okay it was something else

02:37:40.000 --> 02:37:42.000
um

02:37:42.000 --> 02:37:44.000
it was something else way at the start

02:37:44.000 --> 02:37:46.000
and I didn't want to say it

02:37:46.000 --> 02:37:48.000
I was seeking suspicion I know who's getting banned

02:37:48.000 --> 02:37:50.000
just

02:37:50.000 --> 02:37:52.000
do a couple of them clapping with no hands audio

02:37:52.000 --> 02:37:54.000
sounds like you got a good workout

02:37:54.000 --> 02:37:56.000
and bruh I was so out of breath

02:37:56.000 --> 02:37:58.000
recording that like

02:37:58.000 --> 02:38:00.000
horrifically out of breath

02:38:00.000 --> 02:38:02.000
I was like

02:38:02.000 --> 02:38:04.000
like you can literally here we go like

02:38:04.000 --> 02:38:06.000
ah

02:38:06.000 --> 02:38:08.000
clap clap clap clap clap clap basically

02:38:08.000 --> 02:38:10.000
I was so bad

02:38:10.000 --> 02:38:12.000
I was so bad

02:38:14.000 --> 02:38:16.000
man

02:38:16.000 --> 02:38:18.000
wait what level did I just get

02:38:18.000 --> 02:38:20.000
64

02:38:20.000 --> 02:38:22.000
64 bro wait why can I not kick this

02:38:22.000 --> 02:38:24.000
yes oh my god

02:38:24.000 --> 02:38:26.000
it was 64

02:38:30.000 --> 02:38:32.000
I was suggested sin cells that was

02:38:32.000 --> 02:38:34.000
it I didn't yeah I'm pretty sure

02:38:34.000 --> 02:38:36.000
isn't incel and

02:38:36.000 --> 02:38:38.000
what's that other word

02:38:38.000 --> 02:38:40.000
like a ban phrase on twitch

02:38:40.000 --> 02:38:42.000
now do they still do that

02:38:42.000 --> 02:38:44.000
do they still moderate that

02:38:44.000 --> 02:38:46.000
because I remember it got banned

02:38:46.000 --> 02:38:48.000
and I was like isn't that

02:38:48.000 --> 02:38:50.000
like I don't like the word

02:38:50.000 --> 02:38:52.000
simp because I feel like it's used anytime

02:38:52.000 --> 02:38:54.000
where a guy just genuinely enjoys content

02:38:54.000 --> 02:38:56.000
from a girl which is so

02:38:56.000 --> 02:38:58.000
like it's quite frustrating because it's just like

02:38:58.000 --> 02:39:00.000
I don't like the terminology

02:39:00.000 --> 02:39:02.000
but to like outright ban it

02:39:02.000 --> 02:39:04.000
is like what oh did I

02:39:04.000 --> 02:39:06.000
miss a few cents yeah twitch doesn't

02:39:06.000 --> 02:39:08.000
allow those words but I've never really tested it out

02:39:10.000 --> 02:39:12.000
you can get banned for it that's

02:39:12.000 --> 02:39:14.000
pretty

02:39:14.000 --> 02:39:16.000
yeah like I'm pretty

02:39:16.000 --> 02:39:18.000
tired of the word simp because I think it's

02:39:18.000 --> 02:39:20.000
used whenever someone just genuinely enjoys

02:39:20.000 --> 02:39:22.000
content that just happens to be from

02:39:22.000 --> 02:39:24.000
a chick like it's really

02:39:24.000 --> 02:39:26.000
but anyway I think outright

02:39:26.000 --> 02:39:28.000
banning it is like a bit severe

02:39:28.000 --> 02:39:30.000
I just hope that the

02:39:30.000 --> 02:39:32.000
definition slowly changes over time

02:39:32.000 --> 02:39:34.000
did someone just talk there

02:39:34.000 --> 02:39:36.000
maybe later

02:39:36.000 --> 02:39:38.000
oh wait was that for me

02:39:38.000 --> 02:39:40.000
oh my god I wasn't paying attention

02:39:40.000 --> 02:39:42.000
was that for me

02:39:46.000 --> 02:39:48.000
the moderation is inconsistent

02:39:48.000 --> 02:39:50.000
to say the least yeah it's why I don't

02:39:50.000 --> 02:39:52.000
really enjoy twitch

02:39:52.000 --> 02:39:54.000
a lot of people write why not twitch

02:39:54.000 --> 02:39:56.000
but I have seen countless examples

02:39:56.000 --> 02:39:58.000
of what have how they don't

02:39:58.000 --> 02:40:00.000
apply the rules fairly

02:40:00.000 --> 02:40:02.000
at least with youtube

02:40:02.000 --> 02:40:04.000
it does seem like a

02:40:04.000 --> 02:40:06.000
overall blanket

02:40:06.000 --> 02:40:08.000
which is very easy to be like okay

02:40:08.000 --> 02:40:10.000
right because like

02:40:10.000 --> 02:40:12.000
now I'm aware that you're looking

02:40:12.000 --> 02:40:14.000
isn't allowed now I don't know why

02:40:14.000 --> 02:40:16.000
older videos that are made

02:40:16.000 --> 02:40:18.000
eons back are fine but recently

02:40:18.000 --> 02:40:20.000
not know like Azura

02:40:20.000 --> 02:40:22.000
was eating a cookie

02:40:22.000 --> 02:40:24.000
Azura was eating a cookie

02:40:24.000 --> 02:40:26.000
and she got a warning for

02:40:26.000 --> 02:40:28.000
enjoying a cookie just because

02:40:28.000 --> 02:40:30.000
her voice is so silky smooth

02:40:32.000 --> 02:40:34.000
it's definitely been

02:40:34.000 --> 02:40:36.000
generalized to any sort of kindness towards a person

02:40:36.000 --> 02:40:38.000
but especially women

02:40:38.000 --> 02:40:40.000
yeah like it's why I'm pretty

02:40:40.000 --> 02:40:42.000
tired of hearing about it to be honest

02:40:42.000 --> 02:40:44.000
like I think it's overstayed it's welcome

02:40:44.000 --> 02:40:46.000
cause it just gets used to

02:40:46.000 --> 02:40:48.000
oh you enjoy any type of

02:40:48.000 --> 02:40:50.000
content from women

02:40:50.000 --> 02:40:52.000
and it's like bruv I'm just here

02:40:52.000 --> 02:40:54.000
enjoy the runescape streams like my god

02:40:54.000 --> 02:40:56.000
I'm here enjoy the rambles and how we're going to take down

02:40:56.000 --> 02:40:58.000
the big banks

02:40:58.000 --> 02:41:00.000
um

02:41:00.000 --> 02:41:02.000
I prefer youtube

02:41:02.000 --> 02:41:04.000
twitch raising sub prices

02:41:04.000 --> 02:41:06.000
oh my gosh yes at least

02:41:06.000 --> 02:41:08.000
with youtube you can decide on membership

02:41:08.000 --> 02:41:10.000
price I say that as if I didn't

02:41:10.000 --> 02:41:12.000
begrudgingly raise my price by a dollar

02:41:12.000 --> 02:41:14.000
of pure rage

02:41:14.000 --> 02:41:16.000
but I will make it up I will do as much

02:41:16.000 --> 02:41:18.000
streaming as I can to

02:41:18.000 --> 02:41:20.000
earn that money

02:41:20.000 --> 02:41:22.000
um

02:41:22.000 --> 02:41:24.000
but yeah twitcher just seems

02:41:24.000 --> 02:41:26.000
to be taking a sin

02:41:26.000 --> 02:41:28.000
moving to youtube

02:41:28.000 --> 02:41:30.000
if you type in

02:41:30.000 --> 02:41:32.000
twitch that you're

02:41:32.000 --> 02:41:34.000
an age you get banned 100%

02:41:34.000 --> 02:41:36.000
yeah

02:41:36.000 --> 02:41:38.000
it was a very

02:41:38.000 --> 02:41:40.000
cookie indeed

02:41:40.000 --> 02:41:42.000
can't eat a cookie on stream

02:41:42.000 --> 02:41:44.000
youtube is really crumbling apart

02:41:46.000 --> 02:41:48.000
thank you

02:41:48.000 --> 02:41:50.000
I came up with that myself thank you

02:41:50.000 --> 02:41:52.000
hi reeflings

02:41:52.000 --> 02:41:54.000
oh it's the person that actually got the name reefling after

02:41:54.000 --> 02:41:56.000
like five hours hi reefling reefling

02:42:00.000 --> 02:42:02.000
no no I came up with that joke myself I promise

02:42:02.000 --> 02:42:04.000
it totally

02:42:04.000 --> 02:42:06.000
totally wasn't uh how is she looking

02:42:06.000 --> 02:42:08.000
how is she looking sideways is she

02:42:08.000 --> 02:42:10.000
supposed to be looking sideways

02:42:12.000 --> 02:42:14.000
I just realized she's never looking

02:42:14.000 --> 02:42:16.000
why are you looking to the side

02:42:16.000 --> 02:42:18.000
I don't know maybe she's got like a sore neck

02:42:18.000 --> 02:42:20.000
or something that's okay

02:42:24.000 --> 02:42:26.000
I didn't miss the

02:42:26.000 --> 02:42:28.000
yeah it turns out all

02:42:28.000 --> 02:42:30.000
had to do was open the application

02:42:30.000 --> 02:42:32.000
in order for it to make noise

02:42:32.000 --> 02:42:34.000
I accidentally closed it the other time I tried

02:42:34.000 --> 02:42:36.000
it and couldn't figure it out

02:42:36.000 --> 02:42:38.000
she's so shy she can't look us in the eyes

02:42:38.000 --> 02:42:40.000
honestly like look into my eyes

02:42:40.000 --> 02:42:42.000
not around my eyes

02:42:42.000 --> 02:42:44.000
yeah

02:42:44.000 --> 02:42:46.000
it's like when you see a guy call

02:42:46.000 --> 02:42:48.000
someone a simp for watching a girl

02:42:48.000 --> 02:42:50.000
and then you look and they watch some big muscle

02:42:50.000 --> 02:42:52.000
male streamer for nine hours a day

02:42:52.000 --> 02:42:54.000
but that doesn't count

02:42:54.000 --> 02:42:56.000
literally glorkin

02:42:56.000 --> 02:42:58.000
hard on it

02:42:58.000 --> 02:43:00.000
but because it's a whammin bad

02:43:00.000 --> 02:43:02.000
but male good

02:43:02.000 --> 02:43:04.000
bruv we're tired

02:43:04.000 --> 02:43:06.000
bruv let's just enjoy

02:43:06.000 --> 02:43:08.000
let's just enjoy the conspiracy through

02:43:08.000 --> 02:43:10.000
okay let's just enjoy him

02:43:10.000 --> 02:43:12.000
it makes you a simp for listening

02:43:12.000 --> 02:43:14.000
to me coconut

02:43:14.000 --> 02:43:16.000
my cheeks

02:43:16.000 --> 02:43:18.000
and make them clap for 15 minutes and hey ho

02:43:18.000 --> 02:43:20.000
then hey ho

02:43:20.000 --> 02:43:22.000
snakes and stones

02:43:22.000 --> 02:43:24.000
may break my bronze

02:43:24.000 --> 02:43:26.000
but you'll never get more quality content

02:43:26.000 --> 02:43:28.000
from another streamer

02:43:28.000 --> 02:43:30.000
when it comes to ASMR

02:43:30.000 --> 02:43:32.000
no that's a lie that's a lie

02:43:32.000 --> 02:43:34.000
oh 8.6

02:43:34.000 --> 02:43:36.000
8.6

02:43:36.000 --> 02:43:38.000
bronze

02:43:38.000 --> 02:43:40.000
bronze

02:43:40.000 --> 02:43:42.000
my issue with twitch at the moment is

02:43:42.000 --> 02:43:44.000
something about the vtuber

02:43:44.000 --> 02:43:46.000
yes that was a recent to us update

02:43:46.000 --> 02:43:48.000
if you did not hear the news

02:43:48.000 --> 02:43:50.000
vtubers now

02:43:50.000 --> 02:43:52.000
must

02:43:52.000 --> 02:43:54.000
conform

02:43:54.000 --> 02:43:56.000
to the attire

02:43:56.000 --> 02:43:58.000
rules of in real life streamers

02:43:58.000 --> 02:44:00.000
but the problem with that is a lot of vtuber models

02:44:00.000 --> 02:44:02.000
you know

02:44:02.000 --> 02:44:04.000
they have a bit of appeal to them

02:44:04.000 --> 02:44:06.000
show if you will

02:44:06.000 --> 02:44:08.000
and because of twitch's

02:44:08.000 --> 02:44:10.000
who goes there inconsistencies

02:44:10.000 --> 02:44:12.000
it's very hard

02:44:12.000 --> 02:44:14.000
to ascertain

02:44:14.000 --> 02:44:16.000
if

02:44:16.000 --> 02:44:18.000
uh oh sorry

02:44:18.000 --> 02:44:20.000
hold on

02:44:20.000 --> 02:44:22.000

02:44:22.000 --> 02:44:24.000

until 11 hours and 55 minutes

02:45:30.000 --> 02:45:32.000
because that is exactly when the vod breaks

02:45:32.000 --> 02:45:34.000
em

02:45:34.000 --> 02:45:36.000
so please do not be afraid

02:45:36.000 --> 02:45:38.000
to watch my gen mates and enjoy them

02:45:38.000 --> 02:45:40.000
and then you are welcome

02:45:40.000 --> 02:45:42.000
to come back to me at any time

02:45:42.000 --> 02:45:44.000
wow this person got gardening

02:45:44.000 --> 02:45:46.000
gardening

02:45:46.000 --> 02:45:48.000
you got a freaking cabbage on your back

02:45:48.000 --> 02:45:50.000
aww you got green cake

02:45:50.000 --> 02:45:52.000
aww I forgot to buy his green cake

02:45:52.000 --> 02:45:54.000
we should probably buy green cakes

02:45:54.000 --> 02:45:56.000
aren't the twitch attire standards

02:45:56.000 --> 02:45:58.000
based on what you are

02:45:58.000 --> 02:46:00.000
doesn't that mean vtubers need to

02:46:00.000 --> 02:46:02.000
yeah so on twitch

02:46:02.000 --> 02:46:04.000
you can

02:46:04.000 --> 02:46:06.000
stream in a bikini if you are in a pool

02:46:06.000 --> 02:46:08.000
or a hot tub

02:46:08.000 --> 02:46:10.000
so that is like saying

02:46:10.000 --> 02:46:12.000
I could pop up on my bikini toggle

02:46:12.000 --> 02:46:14.000
right now and put like a hot tub

02:46:14.000 --> 02:46:16.000
asset and then I am good to go

02:46:16.000 --> 02:46:18.000
question mark like that seems pretty redone

02:46:18.000 --> 02:46:20.000
this

02:46:20.000 --> 02:46:22.000
I'll close that because it is kind of covering up

02:46:22.000 --> 02:46:24.000
me me me

02:46:24.000 --> 02:46:26.000
em

02:46:26.000 --> 02:46:28.000
don't forget

02:46:28.000 --> 02:46:30.000
that twitch has the hot tub category

02:46:30.000 --> 02:46:32.000
which is only worth watching

02:46:32.000 --> 02:46:34.000
when some insane guy in a lab coat

02:46:34.000 --> 02:46:36.000
show oh no the fire we got so distracted

02:46:36.000 --> 02:46:38.000
we got so distracted

02:46:38.000 --> 02:46:40.000
talking about the um

02:46:40.000 --> 02:46:42.000
let me

02:46:42.000 --> 02:46:44.000
let me take the ashes so they don't get in the way

02:46:44.000 --> 02:46:46.000
I thought ashes got in the way of cooking

02:46:46.000 --> 02:46:48.000
am I going crazy did I make that up

02:46:48.000 --> 02:46:50.000
fire

02:46:50.000 --> 02:46:52.000
er yes thank you

02:46:52.000 --> 02:46:54.000
much more depreciation

02:46:54.000 --> 02:46:56.000
em

02:46:56.000 --> 02:46:58.000
I completely forgot what I was saying

02:46:58.000 --> 02:47:00.000
in real life youtube is barely having a time

02:47:00.000 --> 02:47:02.000
I feel like they get away with anything

02:47:02.000 --> 02:47:04.000
youtube is definitely more

02:47:04.000 --> 02:47:06.000
late wait am I dumb

02:47:06.000 --> 02:47:08.000
I am em youtube is definitely

02:47:08.000 --> 02:47:10.000
like so much nicer than me

02:47:10.000 --> 02:47:12.000
em

02:47:12.000 --> 02:47:14.000
it's just the facts

02:47:14.000 --> 02:47:16.000
bro I'm sorry you can argue

02:47:16.000 --> 02:47:18.000
to a wall

02:47:18.000 --> 02:47:20.000
god my burn rate keeps going up

02:47:20.000 --> 02:47:22.000
stop

02:47:22.000 --> 02:47:24.000
stop stop burning

02:47:24.000 --> 02:47:26.000
you shouldn't be burning

02:47:28.000 --> 02:47:30.000
em

02:47:30.000 --> 02:47:32.000
I'm here for the long haul oh yeah

02:47:32.000 --> 02:47:34.000
you got endurance for 12 hours

02:47:34.000 --> 02:47:36.000
abusing mods

02:47:36.000 --> 02:47:38.000
streamer abusing mods

02:47:38.000 --> 02:47:40.000
but they like it though

02:47:40.000 --> 02:47:42.000
don't you mods

02:47:42.000 --> 02:47:44.000
but you can't speak

02:47:44.000 --> 02:47:46.000
ha ha ha this is a one-sided

02:47:46.000 --> 02:47:48.000
conversation

02:47:48.000 --> 02:47:50.000
em

02:47:50.000 --> 02:47:52.000
I think

02:47:52.000 --> 02:47:54.000
all the girls got extra mods by the way

02:47:54.000 --> 02:47:56.000
so do check your discord

02:47:56.000 --> 02:47:58.000
or whatever you applied with

02:47:58.000 --> 02:48:00.000
I have no idea I didn't handle the mods

02:48:00.000 --> 02:48:02.000
so if you got picked as a mod congrats

02:48:02.000 --> 02:48:04.000
wasn't it me

02:48:04.000 --> 02:48:06.000
em

02:48:06.000 --> 02:48:08.000
but do check because I think

02:48:08.000 --> 02:48:10.000
3 people didn't respond

02:48:10.000 --> 02:48:12.000
even though they were super keen

02:48:12.000 --> 02:48:14.000
em

02:48:14.000 --> 02:48:16.000
twitch admins have their favourite

02:48:16.000 --> 02:48:18.000
mods and shambles

02:48:18.000 --> 02:48:20.000
tell me

02:48:20.000 --> 02:48:22.000
about the dude with the lab coat in the bikini

02:48:22.000 --> 02:48:24.000
wait is that real

02:48:24.000 --> 02:48:26.000
gotta get your hair blower up

02:48:26.000 --> 02:48:28.000
there are potions

02:48:28.000 --> 02:48:30.000
to help you last longer

02:48:30.000 --> 02:48:32.000
oh my god that's terrible

02:48:32.000 --> 02:48:34.000
mods aren't real they're like birds

02:48:34.000 --> 02:48:36.000
post what you want

02:48:36.000 --> 02:48:38.000
no I'm not here I do have mods

02:48:38.000 --> 02:48:40.000
we need to keep things above board

02:48:42.000 --> 02:48:44.000
another mod flexing on you

02:48:44.000 --> 02:48:46.000
by deleting your message

02:48:46.000 --> 02:48:48.000
lmao

02:48:48.000 --> 02:48:50.000
lmao

02:48:50.000 --> 02:48:52.000
and slap

02:48:52.000 --> 02:48:54.000
I don't know what the lab coat thing is though

02:48:54.000 --> 02:48:56.000
twitch feels better as a dedicated streaming site

02:48:56.000 --> 02:48:58.000
but the actual infrastructure management

02:48:58.000 --> 02:49:00.000
is awful yeah I would say

02:49:00.000 --> 02:49:02.000
discoverability on

02:49:02.000 --> 02:49:04.000
youtube is so much better

02:49:04.000 --> 02:49:06.000
em in my opinion

02:49:06.000 --> 02:49:08.000
especially with the shorts algorithm

02:49:08.000 --> 02:49:10.000
I would say on twitch

02:49:10.000 --> 02:49:12.000
the only way I could

02:49:12.000 --> 02:49:14.000
you know

02:49:14.000 --> 02:49:16.000
foresee someone

02:49:16.000 --> 02:49:18.000
em

02:49:18.000 --> 02:49:20.000
for

02:49:20.000 --> 02:49:22.000
foresee

02:49:22.000 --> 02:49:24.000
foresee someone

02:49:24.000 --> 02:49:26.000
being

02:49:26.000 --> 02:49:28.000
um

02:49:28.000 --> 02:49:30.000
discovered is the

02:49:30.000 --> 02:49:32.000
raid option which is called

02:49:32.000 --> 02:49:34.000
redirect on youtube

02:49:34.000 --> 02:49:36.000
if you get a streamer that is kind

02:49:36.000 --> 02:49:38.000
enough and is massive and raids into you

02:49:38.000 --> 02:49:40.000
it can

02:49:40.000 --> 02:49:42.000
literally make or break

02:49:42.000 --> 02:49:44.000
you as a streamer like it's pretty insane

02:49:44.000 --> 02:49:46.000
it really is

02:49:46.000 --> 02:49:48.000
like I have told

02:49:48.000 --> 02:49:50.000
the girls please to always raid

02:49:50.000 --> 02:49:52.000
into each other to keep a train going

02:49:52.000 --> 02:49:54.000
em if

02:49:54.000 --> 02:49:56.000
no other talent is online then you're more than

02:49:56.000 --> 02:49:58.000
welcome to raid into

02:49:58.000 --> 02:50:00.000
another agency

02:50:00.000 --> 02:50:02.000
no problem at all like I

02:50:02.000 --> 02:50:04.000
yesterday called

02:50:04.000 --> 02:50:06.000
in a favor with a friend

02:50:06.000 --> 02:50:08.000
mimosa and

02:50:08.000 --> 02:50:10.000
she was so polite was it

02:50:10.000 --> 02:50:12.000
yesterday no it must have been the other day

02:50:12.000 --> 02:50:14.000
em she was so polite

02:50:14.000 --> 02:50:16.000
and I said look I'll raid into you

02:50:16.000 --> 02:50:18.000
but do me a favor when you finish up

02:50:18.000 --> 02:50:20.000
your stream raid back into a violor girl

02:50:20.000 --> 02:50:22.000
and she said that is more than

02:50:22.000 --> 02:50:24.000
I'm more than happy with those terms and I was

02:50:24.000 --> 02:50:26.000
like yeah I'm more than happy calling

02:50:26.000 --> 02:50:28.000
a favor for a friend

02:50:28.000 --> 02:50:30.000
em

02:50:30.000 --> 02:50:32.000
yes

02:50:32.000 --> 02:50:34.000
I absolutely don't mind

02:50:34.000 --> 02:50:36.000
it at all em the VNU girls

02:50:36.000 --> 02:50:38.000
have been absolutely fantastic

02:50:38.000 --> 02:50:40.000
some of them have been raiding into me

02:50:40.000 --> 02:50:42.000
I actually need to start messaging some of them

02:50:42.000 --> 02:50:44.000
and being like hey you have 3D or microphone

02:50:44.000 --> 02:50:46.000
question mark question mark

02:50:46.000 --> 02:50:48.000
em yeah

02:50:48.000 --> 02:50:50.000
I still find the violor mentality of mods

02:50:50.000 --> 02:50:52.000
please do this thing thank you now please be quiet

02:50:52.000 --> 02:50:54.000
affectionately

02:50:54.000 --> 02:50:56.000
eee

02:50:56.000 --> 02:50:58.000
yes em it's very

02:50:58.000 --> 02:51:00.000
I don't want to say

02:51:00.000 --> 02:51:02.000
jarring

02:51:02.000 --> 02:51:04.000
em but for someone who maybe

02:51:04.000 --> 02:51:06.000
is new to stream

02:51:06.000 --> 02:51:08.000
and em

02:51:08.000 --> 02:51:10.000
the streamer

02:51:10.000 --> 02:51:12.000
is having a repertoire

02:51:12.000 --> 02:51:14.000
but a back and forth with mods that are named

02:51:14.000 --> 02:51:16.000
is a bit not isolated

02:51:16.000 --> 02:51:18.000
but it's like you've it feels like

02:51:18.000 --> 02:51:20.000
you've missed out on lore and it just gets harder

02:51:20.000 --> 02:51:22.000
to enjoy the streamer like someone

02:51:22.000 --> 02:51:24.000
could be lurking watching me for the first time

02:51:24.000 --> 02:51:26.000
right now em

02:51:26.000 --> 02:51:28.000
and just being like what's she all about type

02:51:28.000 --> 02:51:30.000
thing and if I'm like oh mod X

02:51:30.000 --> 02:51:32.000
mod this mod Y mod B

02:51:32.000 --> 02:51:34.000
you can see and like crack and like you jokes all the time

02:51:34.000 --> 02:51:36.000
em like

02:51:36.000 --> 02:51:38.000
it's not very

02:51:38.000 --> 02:51:40.000
enabling to come in

02:51:40.000 --> 02:51:42.000
for the first time

02:51:42.000 --> 02:51:44.000
em

02:51:44.000 --> 02:51:46.000
whereas I quite like the

02:51:46.000 --> 02:51:48.000
mods don't speak but we are

02:51:48.000 --> 02:51:50.000
incredibly appreciative for you you know

02:51:50.000 --> 02:51:52.000
mopping

02:51:52.000 --> 02:51:54.000
mopping the floors and making sure everything

02:51:54.000 --> 02:51:56.000
is good to go in the stream yeah

02:51:56.000 --> 02:51:58.000
em

02:51:58.000 --> 02:52:00.000
do shorts still work for discovery

02:52:00.000 --> 02:52:02.000
emory said

02:52:02.000 --> 02:52:04.000
they attach dead people to the channel

02:52:04.000 --> 02:52:06.000
now

02:52:06.000 --> 02:52:08.000
emy isn't entirely

02:52:08.000 --> 02:52:10.000
wrong but she isn't entirely right

02:52:10.000 --> 02:52:12.000
shorts

02:52:12.000 --> 02:52:14.000
definitely have a

02:52:14.000 --> 02:52:16.000
subscription

02:52:16.000 --> 02:52:18.000
subscriber count effect

02:52:18.000 --> 02:52:20.000
em and they also

02:52:20.000 --> 02:52:22.000
have discoverability effect

02:52:22.000 --> 02:52:24.000
now not all shorts

02:52:24.000 --> 02:52:26.000
people who will subscribe to you

02:52:26.000 --> 02:52:28.000
will show up in a live stream that's just

02:52:28.000 --> 02:52:30.000
back some people purely

02:52:30.000 --> 02:52:32.000
enjoy shorts mind

02:52:32.000 --> 02:52:34.000
and they will just watch shorts and nothing

02:52:34.000 --> 02:52:36.000
else that's perfectly fine

02:52:36.000 --> 02:52:38.000
so emy is both right and both a wee bit

02:52:38.000 --> 02:52:40.000
wrong it's very good

02:52:40.000 --> 02:52:42.000
em I do have

02:52:42.000 --> 02:52:44.000
brah

02:52:44.000 --> 02:52:46.000
I have three shorts editors

02:52:46.000 --> 02:52:48.000
and all three of them are busy for a couple

02:52:48.000 --> 02:52:50.000
of weeks and I could absolutely

02:52:50.000 --> 02:52:52.000
smash their faces in because I need help

02:52:52.000 --> 02:52:54.000
I don't have editing skills

02:52:54.000 --> 02:52:56.000
em

02:52:56.000 --> 02:52:58.000
I think I'm going to have to reach out to an editor

02:52:58.000 --> 02:53:00.000
that I like to style of

02:53:00.000 --> 02:53:02.000
it's because I'm

02:53:02.000 --> 02:53:04.000
I'm drowning I need help with shorts

02:53:04.000 --> 02:53:06.000
and I do not have the skills for it

02:53:06.000 --> 02:53:08.000
nor do I have the time for it

02:53:08.000 --> 02:53:10.000
but I'm now that the girls are monetized

02:53:10.000 --> 02:53:12.000
I'm wanting to

02:53:12.000 --> 02:53:14.000
actually scroll

02:53:14.000 --> 02:53:16.000
em I'm wanting to start pushing out

02:53:16.000 --> 02:53:18.000
shorts for the baby girls now

02:53:18.000 --> 02:53:20.000
em to help with overall sub count

02:53:20.000 --> 02:53:22.000
em we are going to

02:53:22.000 --> 02:53:24.000
put some advertisements into the shorts

02:53:24.000 --> 02:53:26.000
as well so some might have more views

02:53:26.000 --> 02:53:28.000
and others and we'll

02:53:28.000 --> 02:53:30.000
take it from there look it's just a kind

02:53:30.000 --> 02:53:32.000
of em my current

02:53:32.000 --> 02:53:34.000
goal once everyone has done their celebration

02:53:34.000 --> 02:53:36.000
monetization stream is

02:53:36.000 --> 02:53:38.000
my current goals I'm going to get everyone to

02:53:38.000 --> 02:53:40.000
5k subscribers

02:53:40.000 --> 02:53:42.000
em

02:53:42.000 --> 02:53:44.000
which

02:53:44.000 --> 02:53:46.000
shouldn't really be too hard

02:53:46.000 --> 02:53:48.000
em I do

02:53:48.000 --> 02:53:50.000
have a collab ASMR that's going to go on

02:53:50.000 --> 02:53:52.000
AC's channel

02:53:52.000 --> 02:53:54.000
which should help boost her a little bit

02:53:54.000 --> 02:53:56.000
em because the culling was just so

02:53:56.000 --> 02:53:58.000
oh 65

02:53:58.000 --> 02:54:00.000
wait we're going to

02:54:00.000 --> 02:54:02.000
approach the naughty numbers

02:54:02.000 --> 02:54:04.000
any naughty number approaches

02:54:04.000 --> 02:54:06.000
me

02:54:06.000 --> 02:54:08.000
em new viewers feel like

02:54:08.000 --> 02:54:10.000
they are walking into a friend group

02:54:10.000 --> 02:54:12.000
yes

02:54:12.000 --> 02:54:14.000
it definitely is

02:54:14.000 --> 02:54:16.000
kind of like especially

02:54:16.000 --> 02:54:18.000
whenever I

02:54:18.000 --> 02:54:20.000
kind of talk I like to

02:54:20.000 --> 02:54:22.000
say oh I spoke about this

02:54:22.000 --> 02:54:24.000
yesterday but don't worry if you weren't

02:54:24.000 --> 02:54:26.000
there because it's also

02:54:26.000 --> 02:54:28.000
quite nice and kind

02:54:28.000 --> 02:54:30.000
language to use for people who may

02:54:30.000 --> 02:54:32.000
genuinely who couldn't have been

02:54:32.000 --> 02:54:34.000
there

02:54:34.000 --> 02:54:36.000
types that

02:54:36.000 --> 02:54:38.000
how did I keep doing that I don't know

02:54:38.000 --> 02:54:40.000
how I keep doing that I'm being such a silly

02:54:40.000 --> 02:54:42.000
bully with that

02:54:42.000 --> 02:54:44.000
whoa 8.4

02:54:44.000 --> 02:54:46.000
ok at 8000 I will

02:54:46.000 --> 02:54:48.000
call a break and I'm going to

02:54:48.000 --> 02:54:50.000
get a cup of tea get some snacks

02:54:50.000 --> 02:54:52.000
em and

02:54:52.000 --> 02:54:54.000
hopefully Gimli doesn't come flying into the room

02:54:54.000 --> 02:54:56.000
the moment I open the door

02:54:56.000 --> 02:54:58.000
but I think she may

02:54:58.000 --> 02:55:00.000
em if the streamer is only talking

02:55:00.000 --> 02:55:02.000
to their mods that's for the rest of the chat

02:55:02.000 --> 02:55:04.000
hmm

02:55:04.000 --> 02:55:06.000
your self count will be inflated but it's still a net positive

02:55:06.000 --> 02:55:08.000
it's a positive overall

02:55:08.000 --> 02:55:10.000
I'm happy to see this

02:55:10.000 --> 02:55:12.000
publicly I really want to get play buttons

02:55:12.000 --> 02:55:14.000
for the girls I think

02:55:14.000 --> 02:55:16.000
I would absolutely

02:55:16.000 --> 02:55:18.000
love that

02:55:18.000 --> 02:55:20.000
em it will take time

02:55:20.000 --> 02:55:22.000
it will take hard work

02:55:22.000 --> 02:55:24.000
it will take dedication but

02:55:24.000 --> 02:55:26.000
em I will

02:55:26.000 --> 02:55:28.000
show the girls what is working for me

02:55:28.000 --> 02:55:30.000
what has worked what is working

02:55:30.000 --> 02:55:32.000
em and

02:55:32.000 --> 02:55:34.000
you know if they do shorts with me

02:55:34.000 --> 02:55:36.000
if they do ASMR collabs with other girls

02:55:36.000 --> 02:55:38.000
em if they

02:55:38.000 --> 02:55:40.000
do stream collabs with the girls

02:55:40.000 --> 02:55:42.000
em I think

02:55:42.000 --> 02:55:44.000
it is very possible

02:55:44.000 --> 02:55:46.000
I actually do not see it as an impossibility

02:55:46.000 --> 02:55:48.000
if the girls let me cook

02:55:48.000 --> 02:55:50.000
and equally they also cook

02:55:50.000 --> 02:55:52.000
em

02:55:52.000 --> 02:55:54.000
I think it would be absolutely lovely

02:55:54.000 --> 02:55:56.000
to get the girls play buttons and

02:55:56.000 --> 02:55:58.000
before anyone asks this viewer

02:55:58.000 --> 02:56:00.000
holding the play buttons

02:56:00.000 --> 02:56:02.000
no why

02:56:02.000 --> 02:56:04.000
I'll say it again

02:56:04.000 --> 02:56:06.000
I would never

02:56:06.000 --> 02:56:08.000
ever

02:56:08.000 --> 02:56:10.000
hold a beautiful

02:56:10.000 --> 02:56:12.000
symbol of their hard work

02:56:12.000 --> 02:56:14.000
their dedication

02:56:14.000 --> 02:56:16.000
their love for their craft

02:56:16.000 --> 02:56:18.000
their love for their community

02:56:18.000 --> 02:56:20.000
from the girl

02:56:20.000 --> 02:56:22.000
absolutely not pointing fingers

02:56:22.000 --> 02:56:24.000
but I think

02:56:24.000 --> 02:56:26.000
it is very clear

02:56:26.000 --> 02:56:28.000
there is corporate greedy

02:56:28.000 --> 02:56:30.000
agencies

02:56:30.000 --> 02:56:32.000
that care about accolades

02:56:32.000 --> 02:56:34.000
to prevent them

02:56:34.000 --> 02:56:36.000
to prevent their talents from holding

02:56:36.000 --> 02:56:38.000
such a beautiful symbol

02:56:38.000 --> 02:56:40.000
and then there are agencies like Vila

02:56:40.000 --> 02:56:42.000
that says do whatever you want

02:56:42.000 --> 02:56:44.000
here's the money

02:56:44.000 --> 02:56:46.000
basically here do me one

02:56:46.000 --> 02:56:48.000
have fun here's your money

02:56:48.000 --> 02:56:50.000
here's your play button

02:56:50.000 --> 02:56:52.000
yes

02:56:52.000 --> 02:56:54.000
you don't want the play button on your giant mega yacht

02:56:54.000 --> 02:56:56.000
no

02:56:56.000 --> 02:56:58.000
I absolutely do not care for that

02:56:58.000 --> 02:57:00.000
right I have to ask

02:57:00.000 --> 02:57:02.000
I actually don't know if it's real

02:57:02.000 --> 02:57:04.000
I only hear it from the memes

02:57:04.000 --> 02:57:06.000
is the yacht real, is there actually a yacht

02:57:06.000 --> 02:57:08.000
or is it just a meme

02:57:08.000 --> 02:57:10.000
hello

02:57:10.000 --> 02:57:12.000
do you plan on playing Titanfall 2

02:57:12.000 --> 02:57:14.000
absolutely it is a fantastic game

02:57:14.000 --> 02:57:16.000
I would love to give it

02:57:16.000 --> 02:57:18.000
a shot

02:57:18.000 --> 02:57:20.000
for the first time as Stronu

02:57:20.000 --> 02:57:22.000
calls

02:57:22.000 --> 02:57:24.000
and we can see BT

02:57:24.000 --> 02:57:26.000
together

02:57:26.000 --> 02:57:28.000
and this time I will get uppies from

02:57:28.000 --> 02:57:30.000
the correct BT and not an enemy

02:57:30.000 --> 02:57:32.000
that freaked me out

02:57:32.000 --> 02:57:34.000
because I could have sworn it was

02:57:34.000 --> 02:57:36.000
um

02:57:36.000 --> 02:57:38.000
nah it's a meme, okay it's a meme

02:57:38.000 --> 02:57:40.000
I thought it was real

02:57:40.000 --> 02:57:42.000
I thought it was actually real

02:57:42.000 --> 02:57:44.000
and someone was like oh my god

02:57:44.000 --> 02:57:46.000
this person owns an actual yacht

02:57:46.000 --> 02:57:48.000
on the back of these vtuber's hard work

02:57:48.000 --> 02:57:50.000
and

02:57:50.000 --> 02:57:52.000
I don't know who it is

02:57:52.000 --> 02:57:54.000
you know who you are

02:57:54.000 --> 02:57:56.000
whoever keeps telling me to save the blue one

02:57:58.000 --> 02:58:00.000
I can't

02:58:00.000 --> 02:58:02.000
my guy for one

02:58:02.000 --> 02:58:04.000
and two Lamal

02:58:04.000 --> 02:58:06.000
I'm starting to think you're just daily

02:58:06.000 --> 02:58:08.000
asking that in my

02:58:08.000 --> 02:58:10.000
marshmallow so I keep bringing it up

02:58:10.000 --> 02:58:12.000
I cannot save anyone

02:58:12.000 --> 02:58:14.000
I cannot save them all

02:58:14.000 --> 02:58:16.000
but those

02:58:16.000 --> 02:58:18.000
who seek the violor route

02:58:18.000 --> 02:58:20.000
I will do anything

02:58:20.000 --> 02:58:22.000
and everything in my power

02:58:22.000 --> 02:58:24.000
to help you achieve your dreams

02:58:24.000 --> 02:58:26.000
and I hope my girls

02:58:26.000 --> 02:58:28.000
are in attest to that

02:58:28.000 --> 02:58:30.000
um

02:58:30.000 --> 02:58:32.000
I am happy to discuss that

02:58:32.000 --> 02:58:34.000
I always root for the underdog

02:58:34.000 --> 02:58:36.000
um

02:58:36.000 --> 02:58:38.000
and I think you should too

02:58:38.000 --> 02:58:40.000
always root for the underdog

02:58:40.000 --> 02:58:42.000
sheebie

02:58:42.000 --> 02:58:44.000
sheebie has finished her masquerade

02:58:44.000 --> 02:58:46.000
part two

02:58:46.000 --> 02:58:48.000

02:59:20.000 --> 02:59:22.000
harem

02:59:22.000 --> 02:59:24.000
that she gave herself a migraine the following day

02:59:40.000 --> 02:59:42.000
down in a dark

02:59:42.000 --> 02:59:44.000
room

02:59:44.000 --> 02:59:46.000
hydrate and

02:59:46.000 --> 02:59:48.000
possibly caffeine

02:59:48.000 --> 02:59:50.000
might help

02:59:50.000 --> 02:59:52.000
I don't know I heard chugging

02:59:52.000 --> 02:59:54.000
one gallon

02:59:54.000 --> 02:59:56.000
no I heard chugging one liter

02:59:56.000 --> 02:59:58.000
of chocolate milk

02:59:58.000 --> 03:00:00.000
also

03:00:00.000 --> 03:00:02.000
destroys a migraine

03:00:02.000 --> 03:00:04.000
but I don't suffer

03:00:04.000 --> 03:00:06.000
from them so please forgive

03:00:06.000 --> 03:00:08.000

03:00:22.000 --> 03:00:24.000
my thought process in typing

so if you do not feel

03:00:46.000 --> 03:00:48.000
so inclined to watch me cook sardines

03:00:48.000 --> 03:00:50.000
to cook 10,000

03:00:50.000 --> 03:00:52.000

in the search bar and it will

03:01:08.000 --> 03:01:10.000
do wonders for the algorithm

03:01:10.000 --> 03:01:12.000
and pushing violor to you yes I am

03:01:12.000 --> 03:01:14.000

the coffin of Andy and Lele

03:01:26.000 --> 03:01:28.000
she's doing the correct thing and she's also holding

03:01:28.000 --> 03:01:30.000
in her urea

03:01:30.000 --> 03:01:32.000
for her chats satisfaction

03:01:32.000 --> 03:01:34.000
I'm not going to judge it look I'm not here to

03:01:34.000 --> 03:01:36.000
judge I'm just here to

03:01:36.000 --> 03:01:38.000
deliver the m-Brian

03:01:38.000 --> 03:01:40.000

Brian okay thank

03:01:46.000 --> 03:01:48.000
you for the tip Brian

03:01:48.000 --> 03:01:50.000
but there was no message so Brian didn't talk

03:01:50.000 --> 03:01:52.000
really

03:01:52.000 --> 03:01:54.000
interesting and good to know yes

03:01:54.000 --> 03:01:56.000
Amy is doing the correct ending to Andy and Lele

03:01:56.000 --> 03:01:58.000
so if you are looking for a bit more

03:01:58.000 --> 03:02:00.000
of engaging

03:02:00.000 --> 03:02:02.000
engaging gameplay then

03:02:02.000 --> 03:02:04.000
rip for Brian

03:02:04.000 --> 03:02:06.000
I'm just here to

03:02:06.000 --> 03:02:08.000
burn swordfish to be honest yeah

03:02:08.000 --> 03:02:10.000
honestly I'm here to burn them too 18.1%

03:02:10.000 --> 03:02:12.000
the burn rate is going up

03:02:12.000 --> 03:02:14.000
I'm not beating the burn rate

03:02:14.000 --> 03:02:16.000
allegations they're not doing too well

03:02:16.000 --> 03:02:18.000
at all

03:02:18.000 --> 03:02:20.000
but thank you for the tip Brian

03:02:24.000 --> 03:02:26.000
less robotic please

03:02:26.000 --> 03:02:28.000
that is how I type

03:02:28.000 --> 03:02:30.000
it's the only way I can get words out and stuff

03:02:30.000 --> 03:02:32.000
it's terrible

03:02:32.000 --> 03:02:34.000
I have like really

03:02:34.000 --> 03:02:36.000
poor

03:02:38.000 --> 03:02:40.000
I have really poor

03:02:40.000 --> 03:02:42.000
I don't mind talking about it like always

03:02:42.000 --> 03:02:44.000
talk about it I have problems reading

03:02:44.000 --> 03:02:46.000
writing which

03:02:46.000 --> 03:02:48.000
I don't you guys are more than welcome to poke fun

03:02:48.000 --> 03:02:50.000
at my grammar my English my spelling

03:02:50.000 --> 03:02:52.000
it does not bother me at all

03:02:52.000 --> 03:02:54.000
because I get to be like a smug little

03:02:54.000 --> 03:02:56.000
mmm about it and be like

03:02:56.000 --> 03:02:58.000
oh yeah I've got problems reading and writing

03:02:58.000 --> 03:03:00.000
and yet my entire job surrounds reading

03:03:00.000 --> 03:03:02.000
and writing isn't that hilarious and I get

03:03:02.000 --> 03:03:04.000
to be smug about it

03:03:04.000 --> 03:03:06.000
because it's like oh well it worked out so far

03:03:06.000 --> 03:03:08.000
even though I can't do it properly

03:03:08.000 --> 03:03:10.000
but I

03:03:10.000 --> 03:03:12.000
please don't ever be like

03:03:12.000 --> 03:03:14.000
oh I'm scared to like poke a little fun

03:03:14.000 --> 03:03:16.000
at me or whatever you're more than welcome to

03:03:16.000 --> 03:03:18.000
it doesn't

03:03:18.000 --> 03:03:20.000
why what if I search

03:03:20.000 --> 03:03:22.000
Azura

03:03:22.000 --> 03:03:24.000
what if I search Azura it doesn't appear on her channel though

03:03:24.000 --> 03:03:26.000
no you have to type her full name

03:03:26.000 --> 03:03:28.000
we've only been out for a week the algorithm

03:03:28.000 --> 03:03:30.000
isn't gonna know you're asking for Azura Delay

03:03:30.000 --> 03:03:32.000
the vtuber you have to type

03:03:32.000 --> 03:03:34.000
Azura Aze Ure A Space De Ule Ete

03:03:36.000 --> 03:03:38.000
there you go Azura Delay

03:03:38.000 --> 03:03:40.000
I know it has a T in it unfortunately

03:03:40.000 --> 03:03:42.000
it is French so you drop the T

03:03:42.000 --> 03:03:44.000
wow wait wait wait whoa whoa whoa whoa

03:03:44.000 --> 03:03:46.000
French and Scottish people

03:03:46.000 --> 03:03:48.000
drop in the T in their pronunciations

03:03:48.000 --> 03:03:50.000
what's going on here

03:03:50.000 --> 03:03:52.000
no I simply type the surname

03:03:52.000 --> 03:03:54.000
with the double L that's the problem

03:03:54.000 --> 03:03:56.000
Katoos

03:03:56.000 --> 03:03:58.000
you gotta give them the government

03:03:58.000 --> 03:04:00.000
aww silly how silly

03:04:00.000 --> 03:04:02.000
how could you forget

03:04:02.000 --> 03:04:04.000
Scrolling Pinterest

03:04:04.000 --> 03:04:06.000
and it's just

03:04:06.000 --> 03:04:08.000
AI generated pics of koalas

03:04:08.000 --> 03:04:10.000
with big what

03:04:10.000 --> 03:04:12.000
wait what

03:04:12.000 --> 03:04:14.000
did you type in one of her vtuber names

03:04:14.000 --> 03:04:16.000
and then came up with that by the way strongy

03:04:16.000 --> 03:04:18.000
since I never played Runescape

03:04:18.000 --> 03:04:20.000
could you sell me on it

03:04:20.000 --> 03:04:22.000
number go up

03:04:22.000 --> 03:04:24.000
yippee

03:04:24.000 --> 03:04:26.000
it is a slow incremental game

03:04:26.000 --> 03:04:28.000
although it well depends on how you want to play it

03:04:28.000 --> 03:04:30.000
I am literally just

03:04:30.000 --> 03:04:32.000
cooking I'm cooking away look

03:04:32.000 --> 03:04:34.000
see this little progress bar

03:04:34.000 --> 03:04:36.000
cooking

03:04:36.000 --> 03:04:38.000
I'm literally level 65

03:04:38.000 --> 03:04:40.000
and cooking and

03:04:40.000 --> 03:04:42.000
I

03:04:42.000 --> 03:04:44.000
I'm watching the bar

03:04:44.000 --> 03:04:46.000
slowly go up

03:04:46.000 --> 03:04:48.000
and it's beautiful

03:04:48.000 --> 03:04:50.000
and I get dopamine every time

03:04:50.000 --> 03:04:52.000
as I level up in the game

03:04:52.000 --> 03:04:54.000
it's gorgeous I just can't help it

03:04:54.000 --> 03:04:56.000
I'm gonna be real

03:04:56.000 --> 03:04:58.000
I'm not even here for the gameplay

03:04:58.000 --> 03:05:00.000
I'm here for rambling while I play Isaac

03:05:00.000 --> 03:05:02.000
I thought about doing Eden Isaac Runs

03:05:02.000 --> 03:05:04.000
shortly for like a shorter stream idea

03:05:04.000 --> 03:05:06.000
if you didn't know

03:05:06.000 --> 03:05:08.000
most Isaac Runs

03:05:08.000 --> 03:05:10.000
last one hour so I thought maybe

03:05:10.000 --> 03:05:12.000
for a shorter stream

03:05:12.000 --> 03:05:14.000
I would purposely do a four hour stream

03:05:14.000 --> 03:05:16.000
so I can redirect into Emi

03:05:16.000 --> 03:05:18.000
because I never redirect into Emi

03:05:18.000 --> 03:05:20.000
I finally got to redirect into Azura

03:05:20.000 --> 03:05:22.000
yesterday

03:05:22.000 --> 03:05:24.000
but I never do it for Emi

03:05:24.000 --> 03:05:26.000
and I can never do it for Icy

03:05:26.000 --> 03:05:28.000
unless I pulled an all-nighter

03:05:28.000 --> 03:05:30.000
I might pull an all-nighter so I can

03:05:30.000 --> 03:05:32.000
say I redirected into Icy just to be a smug little

03:05:32.000 --> 03:05:34.000
hmm about it

03:05:34.000 --> 03:05:36.000
but I

03:05:36.000 --> 03:05:38.000
wanted to do a four hour stream

03:05:38.000 --> 03:05:40.000
so I can redirect into Emi at one point

03:05:40.000 --> 03:05:42.000
because poor Emi never gets redirected

03:05:42.000 --> 03:05:44.000
and my reeflings are never exposed

03:05:44.000 --> 03:05:46.000
to Emi

03:05:46.000 --> 03:05:48.000
what sentence?

03:05:48.000 --> 03:05:50.000
I didn't even mean that sometimes I mean it when I say sentences

03:05:50.000 --> 03:05:52.000
and sometimes the sentences just

03:05:52.000 --> 03:05:54.000
happen

03:05:54.000 --> 03:05:56.000
I thought dropping tea was an American tip

03:05:56.000 --> 03:05:58.000
not the harbor

03:05:58.000 --> 03:06:00.000
don't remind me of all that beautiful tea

03:06:02.000 --> 03:06:04.000
this is a preparation

03:06:04.000 --> 03:06:06.000
but she's cooking for real for me

03:06:06.000 --> 03:06:08.000
everybody feeding the fire to keep up

03:06:08.000 --> 03:06:10.000
yes special thank you

03:06:10.000 --> 03:06:12.000
to the reeflings

03:06:12.000 --> 03:06:14.000
that are just helping stock the fire

03:06:14.000 --> 03:06:16.000
this is making this go so fast

03:06:16.000 --> 03:06:18.000
like so so fast so thank you

03:06:18.000 --> 03:06:20.000
for all your help do it, I appreciate it greatly

03:06:20.000 --> 03:06:22.000
hmm

03:06:24.000 --> 03:06:26.000
but yes

03:06:26.000 --> 03:06:28.000
ok say no more I'm sold and yeah Isaac all day every day

03:06:28.000 --> 03:06:30.000
in November I'm warning you

03:06:30.000 --> 03:06:32.000
all now November stream sniping

03:06:32.000 --> 03:06:34.000
week I'm not even kidding

03:06:34.000 --> 03:06:36.000
I want to play Isaac back to back to back to back to back

03:06:36.000 --> 03:06:38.000
to back to 12 hour injurances

03:06:38.000 --> 03:06:40.000
oh I've not

03:06:40.000 --> 03:06:42.000
done that oh no

03:06:42.000 --> 03:06:44.000
I would have to do all my membership streams

03:06:44.000 --> 03:06:46.000
in one go

03:06:46.000 --> 03:06:48.000
unless I make a deal

03:06:48.000 --> 03:06:50.000
with membership people

03:06:50.000 --> 03:06:52.000
hello strongy first time chatting

03:06:52.000 --> 03:06:54.000
just came here from sheeby stream

03:06:54.000 --> 03:06:56.000
hi harem

03:06:56.000 --> 03:06:58.000
she wasn't holding up no she has

03:06:58.000 --> 03:07:00.000
a migraine

03:07:00.000 --> 03:07:02.000
I honestly I don't know what reason she has

03:07:02.000 --> 03:07:04.000
a migraine for because I'm pretty sure migraines

03:07:04.000 --> 03:07:06.000
have no rhyme or reason

03:07:06.000 --> 03:07:08.000
but I'm like 99% sure

03:07:08.000 --> 03:07:10.000
she was crying happy tears might have

03:07:10.000 --> 03:07:12.000
affected it and she maybe is pretty dehydrated

03:07:12.000 --> 03:07:14.000
right now

03:07:14.000 --> 03:07:16.000
an hour for a run

03:07:16.000 --> 03:07:18.000
mine lasts like 5 minutes I suck at the game

03:07:18.000 --> 03:07:20.000
oh don't worry

03:07:20.000 --> 03:07:22.000

congrats to those who caught it with your face

03:07:26.000 --> 03:07:28.000
if you are lurking

03:07:28.000 --> 03:07:30.000
you might have a thing that needs to enable chat

03:07:30.000 --> 03:07:32.000
but congrats

03:07:32.000 --> 03:07:34.000
thank you so much for the gifted membership

03:07:34.000 --> 03:07:36.000
enjoy the emotes

03:07:36.000 --> 03:07:38.000
there's 10 emotes right now

03:07:38.000 --> 03:07:40.000
I will be last to update my emotes

03:07:40.000 --> 03:07:42.000
because

03:07:42.000 --> 03:07:44.000
the emotes artist is taking their

03:07:44.000 --> 03:07:46.000
unfortunately they need a month

03:07:46.000 --> 03:07:48.000
so it goes

03:07:48.000 --> 03:07:50.000
I say I may

03:07:50.000 --> 03:07:52.000
mercy she be yuzuru me

03:07:52.000 --> 03:07:54.000

but the girls get to pick their emotes now

03:07:56.000 --> 03:07:58.000
I'm not going to ruin any of them

03:07:58.000 --> 03:08:00.000
because it's not my business anymore to ruin or spoil

03:08:00.000 --> 03:08:02.000
the behind the scenes

03:08:02.000 --> 03:08:04.000
the hypno cult rose

03:08:04.000 --> 03:08:06.000
did I catch it

03:08:06.000 --> 03:08:08.000
you didn't catch it with your face rip

03:08:08.000 --> 03:08:10.000
rip and piss

03:08:10.000 --> 03:08:12.000
but yes

03:08:12.000 --> 03:08:14.000
if you are lurking and you aren't a member

03:08:14.000 --> 03:08:16.000
you might have to enable it from chat

03:08:16.000 --> 03:08:18.000
whoa I only burnt 3 that batch

03:08:18.000 --> 03:08:20.000
that was a really good batch

03:08:20.000 --> 03:08:22.000
hold on

03:08:22.000 --> 03:08:24.000
we are cooking by gas reeflings

03:08:24.000 --> 03:08:26.000
we are

03:08:26.000 --> 03:08:28.000
ouch my legs got

03:08:28.000 --> 03:08:30.000
those tingles that really hurt

03:08:30.000 --> 03:08:32.000
ouch

03:08:32.000 --> 03:08:34.000
ouch

03:08:34.000 --> 03:08:36.000
and before it's a blood clot

03:08:36.000 --> 03:08:38.000
if the blood clot goes to my lungs and I die

03:08:38.000 --> 03:08:40.000
I just want to say I love you reeflings

03:08:40.000 --> 03:08:42.000
management

03:08:42.000 --> 03:08:44.000
the girls get to hold the rights to their IPs

03:08:44.000 --> 03:08:46.000
and let them just have 100% of the money

03:08:46.000 --> 03:08:48.000
I don't care I'm dead at that point

03:08:48.000 --> 03:08:50.000
ouch that freaking hurts

03:08:50.000 --> 03:08:52.000

03:09:44.000 --> 03:09:46.000
leave sin sister

03:09:46.000 --> 03:09:49.920
Which leg? Your massive third leg? Oh yeah, you want me to have a big third leg for you?

03:09:51.120 --> 03:09:53.680
Come here, wiefling. Mommy wants to play.

03:09:57.120 --> 03:10:00.400
Some things I say, things that I'm like, that's creepy, not the other way around.

03:10:00.400 --> 03:10:02.960
Um, put it on the table right now.

03:10:05.520 --> 03:10:11.200
Strawny, I can't die. I'm too busy. Literally, I am too busy to die. I'm not even being funny.

03:10:11.200 --> 03:10:15.520
Have you ever heard those stories where people are like in a coma and they're like close to passing

03:10:16.000 --> 03:10:20.400
away, but then they go like, I'm sorry, I can't die right now. Like my family member is going to be

03:10:21.840 --> 03:10:26.080
or like, oh, I'm too busy to die right now. And then they wake up from the coma.

03:10:27.040 --> 03:10:31.680
Have you ever heard those stories? They're pretty crazy. You can't do that. I was caught off by

03:10:31.680 --> 03:10:39.040
surprise. Oh wait, I worked. We will kill to, we will kill death to keep you safe, Strawny. Thank you.

03:10:40.000 --> 03:10:46.000
I appreciate it. No, I am far too busy. I'm not going to say too much,

03:10:47.040 --> 03:10:51.760
because I want to respect my girls, my Jen once. I've obviously been doing a lot of cooking,

03:10:51.760 --> 03:10:55.520
actually. That remains, I need to go ask for a collaboration from another VTuber,

03:10:55.520 --> 03:10:58.080
and I have no idea if they're going to accept, they might accept, they might not.

03:10:59.280 --> 03:11:07.840
Hey ho, we'll try. Currently, Jen too is cooking, and yeah, no, I'm not naming them.

03:11:08.000 --> 03:11:15.280
You'll be happy to know I'm not naming them. But it's very busy trying to maintain everything

03:11:15.280 --> 03:11:26.240
all at once. But I did say I'm a workaholic, and I really enjoy working. I enjoy giving value for

03:11:26.240 --> 03:11:32.160
money as well, especially in this day and age where everything's getting greedier and greedier.

03:11:32.160 --> 03:11:36.720
I'm like, no, we're going to do a business tactic called undercut in the market.

03:11:38.480 --> 03:11:44.640
Undercut, undercut, like that kind of thing. Damn, the hey ho gets moved. Hey ho,

03:11:44.640 --> 03:11:52.160
hey ho, let me finish on my point, hey ho. Yeah, I really like pushing myself to offer value for

03:11:52.160 --> 03:11:57.280
money. It's why even with membership streams, like on days where we do a membership stream,

03:11:57.280 --> 03:12:03.520
I'm still going to do a cheeky two over stream before it, and then we can enjoy our more cuddly

03:12:03.520 --> 03:12:07.680
membership streams. Like, I have absolutely no issue with that. It doesn't bother me none,

03:12:09.040 --> 03:12:18.880
and life, life is good. We, we are bingchining. Undercut in the market, love. Yeah, like I,

03:12:19.600 --> 03:12:24.800
as I said a bit earlier, but for the harem, that might not have been here when I was rambling

03:12:24.800 --> 03:12:30.560
about it. I was saying that even if you cannot physically give any money to the creator you're

03:12:30.560 --> 03:12:36.960
watching, just liking the stream or subscribing to them, or just hanging out and lurking,

03:12:36.960 --> 03:12:44.400
all of this contributes to the algorithm and leads for the girls to more success, especially

03:12:44.400 --> 03:12:52.160
VOD watchers, special shout out to VOD watchers, especially if the girl streams in a not good

03:12:52.240 --> 03:12:58.640
time zone for you. I don't know, if you go into Mercy's comment section, there's like one dedicated

03:12:58.640 --> 03:13:04.560
VOD watcher and I'm like, you are helping her out so much. I understand watching live stream

03:13:04.560 --> 03:13:10.560
VODs is not the funnest thing because the person isn't live, but a lot of you are saying you kind

03:13:10.560 --> 03:13:17.360
of listen to me ramble in the background. That is perfect because you, you engage with the content

03:13:17.360 --> 03:13:23.200
for long periods of time, again, boosting the algorithm for the girl, boosting it, having

03:13:23.200 --> 03:13:31.040
cross promotion with the vealor girls, it's just fantastic. It really is. 12 hours of content for

03:13:31.040 --> 03:13:38.160
free, that is value. Yes, like I don't mind it, like now it's absolutely, it's not, I'm very serious

03:13:38.160 --> 03:13:44.720
when I say this, this is absolutely not a reflection on any other VTuber streamer, whoever, whatever.

03:13:45.440 --> 03:13:56.800
I do not find this to be a job, okay? This is fun, I'm enjoying myself, I am breaking my voice,

03:13:56.800 --> 03:14:02.560
rambling to you, talking about all these plans, I've got cooking, talking about how things are,

03:14:02.560 --> 03:14:09.840
like this doesn't feel a job, feel like a job and I feel sorry for streamers where it does feel

03:14:09.840 --> 03:14:20.480
like a job and they can't publicly come out and be like that. Wow, 66! Maybe that should be my

03:14:21.680 --> 03:14:26.560
donation, like a tip sound instead of, are you squiddin' me right now? Although actually,

03:14:26.560 --> 03:14:34.000
I quite like are you squiddin' me right now. No thanks to the time stampers. Oh yes, special

03:14:34.000 --> 03:14:39.360
thank you to time stampers as well, VOD watchers for any of the girls, the supplies to any of

03:14:39.360 --> 03:14:49.280
the girls, seriously. You do not go unnoticed, especially on ASMR stream, time stamping on ASMR

03:14:49.280 --> 03:14:59.280
streams is very good for me because I do have plans to clip the girls ASMRs. I'm currently in talks

03:14:59.280 --> 03:15:06.480
with someone to do it for me, but the problem is, you know, the profits aren't, the profits won't be

03:15:06.480 --> 03:15:11.120
there for the clipping ASMR things, but you know what, we'll get there, we'll get there.

03:15:13.040 --> 03:15:18.480
All of the Vealoo girls are perfect for background noise, you all have very beautiful voices, oh thank

03:15:18.480 --> 03:15:24.240
you! I'm sure all of us appreciate such a kind comment, like I love her mixer voices accents,

03:15:24.320 --> 03:15:37.120
all of that. 1700 to go. Wait, what's 1700 to go? The fish? Oh no, wait, what's 1700 to go?

03:15:38.240 --> 03:15:46.160
Clipping ASMR is a good idea. Yes, ASMR is a very popular category, so Emmy! Did Emmy get the right

03:15:46.160 --> 03:15:52.800
route? Pen, pals and Emmy, did you get the right route? Did you get the right row? I said row instead

03:15:53.520 --> 03:15:58.800
of row. Hi Emmy, hi pin pals. Don't worry, you don't have to talk too much because I think you're

03:15:58.800 --> 03:16:04.320
bursting at the seams, so please feel free to go to the toilet at any time. The pin pals mouths

03:16:04.320 --> 03:16:09.600
are open. We got the right route, that's what I raised you for, that's what I birthed you from

03:16:09.600 --> 03:16:19.360
my loins for, Emmy, that's my Emmy. Hi pin pals, hi pin pals. Yeah, a pin pal came into my stream

03:16:19.360 --> 03:16:27.440
and tattletailed on Emmy, saying that the pin pals are not giving her permission to tinkle.

03:16:28.000 --> 03:16:37.120
Pin pals, what do you see to such accusations pin pals? Per Emmy's bladder is about to break,

03:16:37.120 --> 03:16:45.440
so it's a traitor. No, no, you've been tattletailed on. Oh, she went snitch. Oh no, scared, that's right,

03:16:45.440 --> 03:16:49.760
I'm on it, you pin pals, you don't think I'm watching you? You, as much as you watch over my

03:16:49.760 --> 03:16:57.280
little sister, I need to watch over you too. No one was supposed to tattle. We were discussing it,

03:16:57.280 --> 03:17:03.760
we were like, uh, yeah, it's quite an interesting, uh, interest. Snitches get stitches. Well,

03:17:03.760 --> 03:17:07.840
pin pals already have stitches, haven't you seen your adorable design? You know, little,

03:17:07.840 --> 03:17:12.640
little stitches over here. I plead the fifth, yeah, you better plead the fifth pin pals,

03:17:12.640 --> 03:17:20.800
you're in trouble. Just to keep you up to date with what is going on on this lovely occasion,

03:17:20.800 --> 03:17:29.440
Acey has finished her stream. Shibi has also finished her stream, unfortunately Shibi isn't

03:17:29.440 --> 03:17:33.280
feeling so well today, so don't be afraid to send your love to Shibi. We gave her good

03:17:33.280 --> 03:17:40.320
altitude care, we took care of her with her sister, Mama. Okay, I'll trust you or that you

03:17:40.320 --> 03:17:50.880
look after your little sister. Um, why only do you want Amy's love? Bruh, has Amy mine corrupted

03:17:50.880 --> 03:17:55.280
you so much that it's not even English? We only do what Amy loves. Oh right, sorry, I'm just

03:17:55.280 --> 03:17:59.680
going in a quandary. So, oh, that was me, that was me, that was on me, that was on me, I'll

03:17:59.680 --> 03:18:05.440
apologize. Apologize, pin pals, that was on me. I'm getting mine, I'm getting mine corrupted,

03:18:05.520 --> 03:18:12.240
just thinking about Amy. Let me do a hydration check, so thank you for coming in. I am just

03:18:12.240 --> 03:18:22.800
doing 99, cooking on RuneScape, not very fun, I know, boring, boo. Azur, oh my god, is that all

03:18:22.800 --> 03:18:32.000
the streams? Wait, is there no Mercy stream? No, tell me you're lying, Mercy modis, is there no

03:18:32.000 --> 03:18:41.760
Mercy stream? Shoulda picked Mercy, is there no Mercy stream? She's playing, no, there is a

03:18:41.760 --> 03:18:47.840
Mercy stream. You should play in a prank on me, she's playing Harvester part two. I'll bean

03:18:47.840 --> 03:18:54.880
machine, thank you for becoming a member. She's playing Harvester part two, um, so don't worry,

03:18:55.840 --> 03:19:04.800
in T minus snippets, any snippets in the chat, T minus one, two, three, four, five-ish hours,

03:19:05.440 --> 03:19:13.520
Mercy's coming online. I am just playing RuneScape, please do not feel forced to watch it,

03:19:13.520 --> 03:19:16.480
I understand it's not the most exciting thing if you are not into RuneScape.

03:19:16.640 --> 03:19:25.200
Um, we are currently in World 380 at Edgeville Bank, uh, Edgeville, that's right, Edge, Edge for me

03:19:25.200 --> 03:19:39.520
right now, um, Bank and Hydration. Did I forget to put that burnt swordfish away? Um, we are currently

03:19:40.640 --> 03:19:45.920
Azur's playing straight, wait, Azur's playing, why does it not display? YouTube is really,

03:19:45.920 --> 03:19:52.160
okay, sorry, Azura, sorry, YouTube is really struggling to show me when the girls are going

03:19:52.160 --> 03:20:00.800
live, oh, her thumbnail is adorable, oh, look at what Azur's thumbnail is, oh, it's adorable, she's

03:20:00.800 --> 03:20:07.120
got a little, her hair on the cat, okay, Azura is up in three hours, just reach 69, how are you a

03:20:07.120 --> 03:20:14.800
higher level than me? Did we not start at the same time? How are you a higher level than me? You can't

03:20:15.520 --> 03:20:23.680
be, reeflings are a higher level than me. Uh, yes, T-minus, for the Bleeding Hearts, T-minus

03:20:23.680 --> 03:20:31.120
three hours for Stray, a lovely, a little meow meow game, um, and then Sniff It's Warning in

03:20:31.120 --> 03:20:35.680
five hours for Harvester, who is putting, are we getting drunk? Hold on, hold on, we're getting

03:20:35.680 --> 03:20:42.160
drunk out in here, hold on, hold on, hold on, let me drop this, let me get drunk right now, go, go, go,

03:20:42.640 --> 03:20:48.800
go! Oh that actually made, I love that noise, go, go, go, go, go, go, Reeflings, you're allowed to

03:20:48.800 --> 03:20:59.440
go take a drink if you like, right, let's use it on the fire, did you select the funny all bell

03:20:59.440 --> 03:21:05.040
on the sub button? Exactly, I don't see Azura's stream, I didn't display for me either, I only

03:21:05.040 --> 03:21:15.840
displayed mercies there. I am under the impression that we are going to be added to Holodex soon,

03:21:15.840 --> 03:21:23.680
which is a website which will list all of our streams and automatically do it to your time zone.

03:21:23.680 --> 03:21:37.840
So that will be coming soon if I'm not mistaken. I don't know how it works,

03:21:37.840 --> 03:21:44.760
but it means that it will auto show you everyone's stream. Veal or we did consider running our own

03:21:44.760 --> 03:21:52.720
website, but it was like another expense that you know what, Holodex does it for free and I'd rather

03:21:52.800 --> 03:22:00.000
put any expenses like back into the girls, back into shorts, back into promotion. There is for

03:22:00.000 --> 03:22:07.040
those pinpals that are listening in and any snowberries, there may or may not be an ASMR

03:22:08.320 --> 03:22:15.920
coming for snowberries and pinpals. I hope you enjoy it when it does come out, but there's a

03:22:15.920 --> 03:22:25.120
little hint for you. Holodex takes an average of 20k on all channels as prerequisite. Okay,

03:22:25.120 --> 03:22:32.160
well we're coming for it. For any yappening that you may have missed out on, because you are

03:22:32.160 --> 03:22:46.960
watching the good ending on an Emmy stream. Long story short, Azura is the last one that we are

03:22:46.960 --> 03:22:54.720
waiting for monetization on and all of the girls have been successfully monetized. I really started

03:22:54.720 --> 03:23:02.000
through that one and the monetization streams will be happening soon. TM, you can become a member

03:23:02.320 --> 03:23:09.360
as a reefling, you can become a member as a snippet and tomorrow snowberries and pinpals,

03:23:10.080 --> 03:23:17.840
you can also become a member because the girls are doing their membership celebration. So please

03:23:17.840 --> 03:23:22.800
do not worry though, the girls will always be streaming for free as well. They will not be

03:23:22.800 --> 03:23:29.040
exclusively doing membership streams, that's not how it works around these parts, but please do

03:23:29.040 --> 03:23:33.840
look out for it because once my endurance stream ends, I'm streaming for 12 hours, I'm doing a

03:23:33.840 --> 03:23:39.360
cheeky endurance stream, once my stream ends I am going to be the one pulling the strings behind

03:23:39.360 --> 03:23:44.960
the scenes and opening up membership, so if you really wanted to get it before the stream you can,

03:23:44.960 --> 03:23:51.680
but it's better to do it on stream because the girls will say your name. Do you want to hear

03:23:51.680 --> 03:23:59.680
the girls say your name? Don't be silly, let the girls say your name. My wallet isn't paying

03:23:59.680 --> 03:24:06.960
waiting for membership to become available. Oh okay, this isn't Emmy in game before anyone

03:24:06.960 --> 03:24:12.960
thinks it's actually Emmy, that's hilarious though. We've got a pinpal and they're waiting on Emmy

03:24:13.040 --> 03:24:21.680
um singing. Say mommy would you like us to send you Emmy's latest dealie at audio and marrow?

03:24:21.680 --> 03:24:27.440
What did she do? What did she do? What did my daughter do?

03:24:30.720 --> 03:24:34.240
What did she do? What did she do? What did I miss?

03:24:35.200 --> 03:24:44.160
Peeler did she just did she just end stream and then give you the audio of

03:24:45.200 --> 03:24:52.880
the bruh bruh snitch it she didn't do anything

03:24:55.680 --> 03:24:56.720
shut up shut up shut up

03:24:57.120 --> 03:25:02.800
hey guys I knew it I knew she was doing it

03:25:13.280 --> 03:25:16.000
she may or may not have been forced to. I'm like

03:25:16.880 --> 03:25:23.600
Danny to join in too but I feel like my my peeler um isn't going to be very fun because I hardly

03:25:23.600 --> 03:25:29.280
have any liquids because I sweat it from my hands and feet so much oh I need to clip that

03:25:29.280 --> 03:25:34.560
actually I need to clip that fucking part of stream where the pop rocks popped to prove how

03:25:34.560 --> 03:25:40.080
sweaty my feet are. I'm probably gonna have to make that clip myself actually now that I think

03:25:40.080 --> 03:25:47.520
about it. Join them mommy the allegations are unfounded. No who hasn't tinkled yet?

03:25:48.320 --> 03:25:53.120
I have not tinkled. Has Azura? I don't think Azura is tinkled.

03:25:54.240 --> 03:26:01.840
Can we return to burpler and not be pissy? Honestly as long as the girls are happy

03:26:01.840 --> 03:26:09.360
and uh you guys are happy then everyone's happy. Couldn't give less of a. Couldn't give less of a

03:29:09.520 --> 03:29:16.880
like like check out these girls strongy there is an actual chance that this being an endurance

03:29:16.880 --> 03:29:22.320
stream will get you to 6k I don't know if the video has got much steam right now you should all

03:29:22.320 --> 03:29:29.920
hit the like and subscribe button right now exactly this weekly news was up um wait I could

03:29:29.920 --> 03:29:36.720
let me show you what the stat says now on the video I'm happy I I don't mind I'm happy to share so

03:29:37.280 --> 03:29:44.720
hold on let me screenshot this yes so this is what I see as the leecher on the other side of the map

03:29:46.800 --> 03:29:55.040
um and then file save as blah blah blah too right so this was hold on I'm freaking accidentally

03:29:55.040 --> 03:30:00.880
screen recording I keep actually on the screen recording I don't know why it does that oh hold

03:30:00.880 --> 03:30:06.320
on the refunds are talking also hit the little bell icon see you guys are better at pushing that stuff

03:30:06.400 --> 03:30:13.200
than me I like I forget to say like oh like and subscribe in this stream oh like I always forget

03:30:13.200 --> 03:30:19.840
to say it even though I'm live for 12 hours I have 12 hours to remember to say one sentence

03:30:19.840 --> 03:30:24.640
and I fail the challenge every single time you guys are just gonna have to do it in the chat for me

03:30:24.640 --> 03:30:32.720
it's kind of ridiculous um right so this is currently uh oh I guess it didn't update so

03:30:32.720 --> 03:30:38.720
you can see like all the stats wait I'll update it to the new one hold on um it didn't update too

03:30:38.720 --> 03:30:45.840
much because I'm live so if you've never seen the behind the scenes before this is what it looks

03:30:45.840 --> 03:30:52.720
like when you upload a youtube video these are the statistics you get you get your viewers you get

03:30:52.720 --> 03:30:58.640
your watch time you get the subscribers that were directly earned from that video so people

03:30:58.720 --> 03:31:02.720
discovered that video for the first time and they click subscribe because they really enjoyed

03:31:02.720 --> 03:31:11.280
me pleading with you to let me hold it ASMR um the reason why estimated revenue is not visible

03:31:11.280 --> 03:31:16.880
is because it takes 48 hours for that statistic to update if you guys really want to see it I'm

03:31:16.880 --> 03:31:23.360
more than happy to share it doesn't bother me noon um I and then you guys can kind of see the fun

03:31:23.360 --> 03:31:31.360
behind the scenes but uh yep um that's what it looks like it says the video has got 19.751 views

03:31:31.920 --> 03:31:38.480
um like subscribe smash the smash the bell member to share the video yes um

03:31:40.160 --> 03:31:46.000
but yeah that that is fantastic uh you can see the little trend if you see that right right side

03:31:46.000 --> 03:31:51.680
trend and you can see when the video was released it had the highest viewpoint and then now it's

03:31:51.680 --> 03:31:59.520
still actually going pretty strong it's it's not doing bad at all it really isn't um but yeah I'm

03:31:59.520 --> 03:32:06.400
more than happy to show that kind of cool behind scene stuff uh you have went from 555 to 5.8 the

03:32:06.400 --> 03:32:12.720
stream um like that video is like propelling me forward I'm hoping the same happens for the other

03:32:12.720 --> 03:32:20.960
girls meme ASMRs because I am not putting any advertisement money into myself I had to at

03:32:20.960 --> 03:32:28.480
debut because we kept getting called below the 1k and we needed the 1k for uh redirecting into each

03:32:28.480 --> 03:32:38.640
other um crowdsourced self-promotion question mark oh my tummy's rumbling I forgot to get some

03:32:39.600 --> 03:32:48.400
that's okay I can ramble for a bit more um but yeah I'm gonna miss the chat you're gonna miss

03:32:48.400 --> 03:32:54.640
the fact the chat is slow oh no no no no no no no no no no no no you see I know how to gatekeep

03:32:54.640 --> 03:32:59.120
myself and do you want you guys want to hear I'll repeat this story as many times as you like

03:32:59.840 --> 03:33:05.440
if I start throwing out ASMR videos people are gonna subscribe for ASMR videos and then they're

03:33:05.440 --> 03:33:13.280
gonna say oh strongy cuddles lives I'm gonna go listen in hold on a minute this this vtuber

03:33:13.920 --> 03:33:21.280
is rantin about how we need to take down black rock this is an ASMR I'm not watching this shit live

03:33:22.240 --> 03:33:27.760
and then they'll only just watch the ASMR videos and just like that I have gatekeep myself successfully

03:33:27.760 --> 03:33:35.120
because I know how to do it so you're welcome you're welcome that's right I've been sitting on

03:33:35.120 --> 03:33:40.240
this plan for a year and I will spoon it from the rooftop but that's the best part yes because

03:33:40.240 --> 03:33:46.000
people will be like I want I want ASMR but you're not doing ASMR live stream and it's like no no I'm

03:33:46.000 --> 03:33:51.600
not what you're gonna do about it you're gonna leave oh dear oh no might and what was it how do

03:33:51.600 --> 03:33:57.600
you call it a tight knit community oh no my tight knit community terrible we're in shambles even though

03:33:57.600 --> 03:34:03.120
I'm finding major success truly in shambles I'm on my knees but yeah you're welcome don't think that

03:34:03.120 --> 03:34:10.240
will work for long well you'll be surprised um I've spoken to other ASMR creators especially

03:34:10.240 --> 03:34:21.760
twitch ASMR creators um I had a friend who used to stream ASMR and she got 700 viewers concurrent on

03:34:21.760 --> 03:34:29.680
ASMR and then she went and played a video game and she got 40 viewers and the entire chat was spamming

03:34:29.680 --> 03:34:33.680
like someone would come in and spam when's your next ASMR stream and then leave again

03:34:35.840 --> 03:34:45.760
tried and true I I'm aware this and it's gonna happen it's just it's just facts okay that logic

03:34:45.760 --> 03:34:52.480
is flawed how dare you how dare you say I'm dumb even though I'm clearly dumb but I've seen it happen

03:34:52.480 --> 03:35:01.280
on twitch yeah mm-hmm yeah it's not that uncommon for ASMR streamers to branch out yes no it's it's

03:35:01.280 --> 03:35:05.200
it's a tactic because I'm always gonna be a gamer I'm always gonna be gaming every day

03:35:05.200 --> 03:35:10.080
actually we're playing lego lord of the rings I can't keep quiet about it because I'm so excited

03:35:10.080 --> 03:35:18.000
to share lego lord of the rings with you guys it's two back-to-back streams again I'm so excited

03:35:18.000 --> 03:35:26.720
because on the first day we play through all the missions and and get like a hundred percent and

03:35:26.720 --> 03:35:31.760
then we get to play in middle earth and it's so fun and I'm so excited so yeah we get to play um

03:35:31.760 --> 03:35:36.560
lego lord of the rings and and it's like one of my top games because it's just so fun and perfect

03:35:36.560 --> 03:35:41.280
although it always glitches out at this one ice lolly place I will show you what I am always

03:35:41.280 --> 03:35:44.800
glitches out and it annoys me to high heaven because I have to let me play the game also

03:35:45.360 --> 03:35:52.480
and lego lord of the rings is super good like will you still play hobbit afterwards yes um I'll

03:35:52.480 --> 03:36:03.760
play hobo hobo 467 I'll play lego hobbit um at a later date it's not my favorite because if you

03:36:03.760 --> 03:36:08.880
didn't know well now you're gonna know because I'm gonna insert my knowledge into your mind

03:36:09.600 --> 03:36:18.720
um lego hobbit is only two games long and it just abruptly ends there's no public

03:36:19.360 --> 03:36:27.120
um explanation that has been released um there are only theories as to why only the two lego

03:36:27.120 --> 03:36:37.200
hobbit two hobbit first movies were made into the lego and not the third um but warner brother

03:36:37.200 --> 03:36:44.880
bean shit heads um yeah it's just a mystery why the game abruptly ends at the two movie mark um

03:36:46.160 --> 03:36:52.960
but it just is what it is um so unfortunately I do not fully enjoy hobbit to the same way I

03:36:52.960 --> 03:37:01.360
enjoy lord of the rings I apologize I do apologize um they lost the source code no I'm pretty sure

03:37:01.360 --> 03:37:10.800
warner brothers were is it warner brothers it's one of them were being they were being very there

03:37:10.800 --> 03:37:15.520
was a lot of production issues with the movie hobbit and then to base something off of the

03:37:15.520 --> 03:37:20.480
movie to get the rights to do something it probably was just getting even worse like the

03:37:20.480 --> 03:37:27.040
production issues on the hobbit were insane like um I've kind of spoken about it but Peter Jackson

03:37:27.120 --> 03:37:35.200
he's the director he became so violently ill tending the fire for mummy thank you briefly um

03:37:35.840 --> 03:37:41.760
he became so violently ill he like lost a bunch of weight he developed stomach ulcers honestly

03:37:41.760 --> 03:37:47.440
I felt like Peter Jackson when we were developing gen one I was getting ill um I'll honestly convince

03:37:47.440 --> 03:37:52.080
myself at a few points I was like this is it this stomach pain I feel right now I've done it I've done

03:37:52.080 --> 03:37:59.120
a Peter Jackson and I've got myself a freaking ulcer in my stomach um do you like the hobbit yes

03:37:59.120 --> 03:38:05.040
I love the hobbit movies I love lord of the rings and hobbit movies and we're gonna watch um if um

03:38:06.080 --> 03:38:11.760
on christmas day we're watching lord of the rings extended and then on boxing day we're

03:38:11.760 --> 03:38:18.480
watching the hobbit extended so I can sing all the songs um because buffer has an amazing song

03:38:18.480 --> 03:38:24.720
when they're with the elves um if I can remember the first sentence of his freaking song

03:38:24.720 --> 03:38:32.480
oh and oh and also had a tipsy cat who paid the five string fiddle he squeaked and he scored

03:38:32.480 --> 03:38:36.640
any quickness tune oh wait I'm I'm I'm skipping the lyrics someone needs to put the lyrics to

03:38:36.640 --> 03:38:48.240
the ball for song oh well there's an end there's an end there's a merry old in beneath the old gray

03:38:48.240 --> 03:38:54.720
hill and there they brew a beer so brown the man on the man himself came down one night to drink his

03:38:54.720 --> 03:39:03.920
film oh the ulcer had a tipsy cat who played the five string fiddle he squeaked and he scored

03:39:03.920 --> 03:39:09.760
any quickness tune and the landlord shook the man on the minutes after three he said I can't

03:39:09.760 --> 03:39:14.000
remember the lyrics you'll need to put the lyrics so I can sing it but I freaking love that and I

03:39:14.000 --> 03:39:23.760
also hate um and that's what bill bull baggins hates was it blunt the nice bend the forks

03:39:24.480 --> 03:39:28.080
did and burn the corks

03:39:30.960 --> 03:39:38.160
that's what bill bull baggins hates oh I love it so much and then obviously misty mountain far

03:39:38.160 --> 03:39:47.680
over the mist misty mountains go I just forgot I'm supposed to be a dwarf when I sing I'm not

03:39:50.640 --> 03:39:52.640
bring it back down here

03:40:03.600 --> 03:40:09.920
scuff the floors honestly isn't the extended like 12 hours original for the trilogy then I might

03:40:09.920 --> 03:40:17.520
have to make a second watch room but that's okay um that's fine I say again the siren can't

03:40:17.520 --> 03:40:22.320

I appreciate it turbo the dog I already said that what your donkey Kong picture well no listen to a

03:42:02.160 --> 03:42:09.440
smashing moment yeah unleash the stress so you're not gonna sing rap god and godzilla

03:42:09.440 --> 03:42:14.080
and scott absolutely no there's no way I can only do like old school m&m and I still need the lyrics

03:42:14.080 --> 03:42:20.400
up on screen um because I won't be able to do it like efficiently what's her burn rate oh it's going

03:42:20.480 --> 03:42:25.200
down 18.2 I'm pretty sure her burn rate was 18.7

03:42:27.920 --> 03:42:40.480
do go donkey kong dk donkey kong is here he's finally back to kick some tail oh dk yeah

03:42:40.480 --> 03:42:43.440
even the scottish version of donkey kong rap I can't remember

03:42:48.080 --> 03:42:55.440
yep but drink on and start singing them bars literally I can't obey myself believe

03:42:56.640 --> 03:43:08.400
that's planet air turns slowly it's hard to stay say I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep

03:43:09.120 --> 03:43:15.920
actually I'm going to do a meme song cover and you guys inspired me during my James Cameron's

03:43:15.920 --> 03:43:24.720
avatar stream and I am going to make a meme song cover of drumroll a secret tunnel but Scottish

03:43:25.280 --> 03:43:32.560
and the artwork for it and someone drew a meme artwork of me which I need to reach out and ask

03:43:32.560 --> 03:43:41.600
for permission to use for it um but someone drew me like going and then in the next frame

03:43:41.600 --> 03:43:50.480
I'm blasting a Scottish beam and I want to use that artwork in the music video um so I'm going to

03:43:50.480 --> 03:43:56.960
see if I can do it so basically two lovers I'm going to get someone to mix it so at least I'm

03:43:56.960 --> 03:44:04.320
not monotone deaf on it forbidden be one another and I'm actually going to have to write the lyrics

03:44:04.320 --> 03:44:10.640
out for the music video maker because they're going to be like what is Faye from Faye

03:44:12.080 --> 03:44:22.960
uh secret tunnel secret tunnel through the mountain secret secret secret secret tunnel

03:44:22.960 --> 03:44:28.320
basically it's going to be like less than 50 seconds but I think it's funny a little question

03:44:28.320 --> 03:44:32.960
for mome are we eventually going back to needy streamer overload for other endings

03:44:35.520 --> 03:44:42.480
maybe a membership stream I don't want to play games I've already done before but a short game

03:44:42.480 --> 03:44:47.360
like that is very good for membership streams in my opinion and again if you're not membered and

03:44:47.360 --> 03:44:51.440
you're listening please don't worry I stream for free every single day you get free content you get

03:44:51.440 --> 03:44:55.760
content out of the wazoo with me okay just let me cook give me time I just need a bit time

03:44:56.480 --> 03:44:59.760
just need a bit of time yes give me some time

03:45:01.760 --> 03:45:04.080
yes a bit of time um

03:45:06.240 --> 03:45:12.880
wait when are you planning to do the first membership stream next week once the schedule

03:45:12.880 --> 03:45:18.720
goes up you will see the membership streams I will have it listed on the schedule there are

03:45:18.720 --> 03:45:24.720
three membership streams next week they are all at different days as well to try and enable

03:45:25.440 --> 03:45:36.880
members to try and get a little cheeky uh little cheeky um shot on a come in to join I will vary

03:45:36.880 --> 03:45:45.120
the days as well and I'll vary the plots but it is a watch along a member ASMR and a tier list

03:45:45.120 --> 03:45:50.560
rating for the first membership stream week we're gonna spend an awful long time on that

03:45:50.560 --> 03:45:55.760
tier list rating so I do apologize it's gonna be a bit of an epic bit of an epic

03:45:59.040 --> 03:46:07.680
thank you oh how's the toe um I I might I might be losing my toenail

03:46:08.000 --> 03:46:21.840
so I went to the doctor man she goes up there all good um and um they've given me an option

03:46:22.640 --> 03:46:29.120
they've given me an option I can either remove a side of my toenail or I can get the whole thing

03:46:29.120 --> 03:46:38.320
taken off and they told me that um if I get the side of it taken off

03:46:40.480 --> 03:46:45.440
because of the shape of my nails I have what's known as c-shaped nails I have no idea if anyone

03:46:45.440 --> 03:46:53.120
listening knows what that means I have c-shaped nails which means I am more prone to this issue

03:46:54.000 --> 03:46:58.720
so they basically said yeah ingrown toenail that was it that's what they said I thought

03:46:58.720 --> 03:47:05.440
she cut into my skin but she cut into my skin and down the side of my nail which is why it was so

03:47:05.440 --> 03:47:14.000
messed up so uh I have an option to either get it cut on the side a little bit or get the whole

03:47:14.000 --> 03:47:20.000
thing taken off um and I've opted to get the whole thing taken off because I can't be arsed

03:47:23.680 --> 03:47:30.080
would you still love me if I didn't have 10 toenails um they said it doesn't grow back

03:47:30.080 --> 03:47:38.720
for some reason your fingernails grow back but your toes don't um so yeah I they said the risk

03:47:38.720 --> 03:47:45.520
because of my nail shape the risk of me having this problem occurring is pretty high um but I

03:47:45.520 --> 03:47:50.400
thought I had normal toes but apparently I have unique c-shaped toes wherever that means yeah

03:47:50.400 --> 03:47:57.360
you still love me okay yeah for some reason if you lose your fingernail it will grow back

03:47:57.360 --> 03:48:04.720
your toenails do not have this ability uh today I have learned um so I have opted just to get it

03:48:04.720 --> 03:48:13.440
yanked off um it's coming up in a few days um I think after my buck shot roulette I am perfectly

03:48:13.440 --> 03:48:19.040
fine to stream I asked I was like is this gonna put me toes built different literally I said is

03:48:19.040 --> 03:48:25.280
this gonna put me like at a disadvantage like will I be able to um I need to be in bedrest

03:48:25.280 --> 03:48:36.880
and they said as long as um it feels fine I feel well I am okay to set up um I am completely okay

03:48:36.880 --> 03:48:44.560
to set up and stream because I was like I still want to stream smile um because uh yeah I'm just

03:48:44.640 --> 03:48:50.800
asked if I needed bed rest but I don't need bed rest for it which is good for me um just means

03:48:50.800 --> 03:48:56.640
we can paint your toenails faster honestly do you should I show what it looks like once it's

03:48:56.640 --> 03:49:03.920
healed up they told me the healing takes a long time so I'm gonna be taking uh vitamins um I'm

03:49:03.920 --> 03:49:10.080
also uh have been advised I need to go sit out in the sun for five minutes to get my vitamin D up

03:49:10.080 --> 03:49:16.320
if you didn't know your vitamin D is what dictates if your scars heal faster uh if winds heal fast

03:49:16.320 --> 03:49:22.800
not scars sorry if a wind doesn't heal fast it becomes a scar but um I looked up some pictures

03:49:22.800 --> 03:49:30.480
of what toes look like that don't have a toenail it doesn't look that gross to me it just looks unique

03:49:31.920 --> 03:49:38.720
um oh no the feet lovers are in shambles with me I'm so sorry if you're a foot lover I recommend

03:49:38.720 --> 03:49:46.000
M.A.B. Zoo she's on a foot cam stream this week I'm afraid I can no longer take over um yeah

03:49:47.280 --> 03:49:52.960
so um that's probably never gonna get a pedicure again I'm sure that surprises no one

03:49:53.760 --> 03:50:01.200
the funny thing was I had looked up stories about going and getting pedicures done and I was like

03:50:01.280 --> 03:50:09.760
oh that sounds so silly that's never gonna happen to me the one time I go and get my freaking toes done

03:50:11.040 --> 03:50:15.840
but I'm not mad honestly I find it quite funny like some I know some people might be like oh my

03:50:15.840 --> 03:50:22.160
god how are you laughing at this I don't know it's just funny like I feel like your body tells stories

03:50:22.160 --> 03:50:29.600
and like my story is like oh I got a pedicure done for my reef lens and now I have nine toenails

03:50:29.840 --> 03:50:35.760
like I think that's a funny story like I think that's hilarious like your body is telling all

03:50:35.760 --> 03:50:45.120
these stories of all the fun you had in your life like I have a scar um on my boob um because I

03:50:45.120 --> 03:50:50.320
handled a feral kitten uh don't recommend ever picking up a feral kitten but unfortunately

03:50:50.320 --> 03:50:55.680
there's an emergency situation so I have a big scar uh a little uh well it's not big sorry it's a

03:50:55.680 --> 03:51:01.040
light white scar that goes along my chest and I just think these kind of things are like

03:51:01.760 --> 03:51:07.360
little funny things being like oh I remember when that happened uh I burnt myself on my mum's lamp

03:51:08.400 --> 03:51:12.800
she had like a nightstand lamp shade thing and I burnt myself on it and I've got a burn on the

03:51:12.800 --> 03:51:18.080
back of my elbow like I think these are like funny kind of things like some people might be embarrassed

03:51:18.080 --> 03:51:23.440
about scars or things going on with their body but I'm like that's me that's that's what makes me me

03:51:24.400 --> 03:51:33.520
um yeah I've got like a scar on my knuckle um because I rode my bike into a event at my grand's

03:51:33.520 --> 03:51:40.880
house and it's like that it's just how I'm made up it's just part of me as a little child uh oh sorry

03:51:40.880 --> 03:51:47.920
I just kicked the mic sorry I'm lifting my feet up hold on let me put my feet up yeah I don't think

03:51:48.000 --> 03:51:53.680
anyone should be embarrassed um about like scars or your body like it's it's you it's what

03:51:53.680 --> 03:52:04.240
makes you a silly goober um you know so my father was a gamers gotta kick it well you can kick me

03:52:04.240 --> 03:52:10.640
again mummy well if I get a plushie I hope you're ready for the amount of ASMR you guys are gonna

03:52:10.640 --> 03:52:15.840
see my hands so much if I get a plushie I'm not even kidding I'm gonna make so much hand cam ASMR

03:52:18.000 --> 03:52:23.600
um yeah got a scar on my right pinky no clue right from Millie Tindley saying Brian

03:52:23.600 --> 03:52:31.040
have appeared today to celebrate the life of strongest tone it died how it lived making content

03:52:31.040 --> 03:52:36.240
honestly though I think that's like a pretty cool story oh wait I did that way to prematurely

03:52:36.240 --> 03:52:41.920
pardon me thank you so much for the the tip reluctant to say yes I have it right now

03:52:42.480 --> 03:52:48.320
um I did tell you guys I am on painkillers unfortunately it is it's throbbing and not

03:52:48.320 --> 03:52:56.800
the good kind of throbbing um I got it assessed and booked me in um but like the doctor was super

03:52:56.800 --> 03:53:02.480
lovely he was so nice um I've not had him as a doctor because I had normally have a chick doctor

03:53:02.480 --> 03:53:08.080
and she's really nice um but like all the doctors in Australia you guys shout out to the to the

03:53:08.080 --> 03:53:12.800
healthcare in Australia you guys are like actually nice what the heck you guys actually want to help

03:53:12.800 --> 03:53:18.400
people with their problems what the heck um so yeah ripped to my my ill fable but I'll keep you

03:53:18.400 --> 03:53:25.520
guys updated um it's after the buckshot roulette stream um so after buckshot roulette originally I

03:53:25.520 --> 03:53:29.360
was going to do a foot cam I'm going to be honest I think I'm probably going to be on an ice pack

03:53:29.360 --> 03:53:33.840
by the time we're on buckshot roulette I think we'll do heart cam for but uh heart cam no we will

03:53:33.840 --> 03:53:40.720
not do heart cam that's just my chest um we will do heartbeat um I think Azura has a heartbeat monitor

03:53:40.720 --> 03:53:48.320
on I was watching her play stardew and I'm like what's 86 what's 82 what's 76 what's 81 I was like

03:53:48.320 --> 03:53:55.520
oh my god it's our heartbeat she has a heart rate monitor on I was like what open heart surgery

03:53:55.520 --> 03:54:03.440
cam honestly the toe not growing back could be different per person whoa your toe came back

03:54:03.440 --> 03:54:09.520
oh they told me what they need to do is like they completely I'm not looking forward to it though

03:54:09.520 --> 03:54:14.000
because they said they have to do like two injections and then yank your freaking nail out which is

03:54:14.000 --> 03:54:21.680
kind of gross but hey oh recovery I think they said roughly two weeks so if you guys really want to

03:54:21.680 --> 03:54:29.440
see it I'll show you but yeah kind of gross are you squiddling me right now anonymous maybe a new

03:54:29.440 --> 03:54:37.200
pedicure will fix the old one is that not how it works no anonymous sadly um the reason why I had a

03:54:37.200 --> 03:54:44.000
plaster over my toe is because when they give you a pedicure they cut around the skin and they cut

03:54:44.000 --> 03:54:52.480
your nails super short because they're going to apply gel to it and the girl accidentally cut into

03:54:52.480 --> 03:55:00.960
the side of my skin and then cut into the nail itself which is why it's causing all these problems

03:55:00.960 --> 03:55:08.720
and basically acting infected because it's now growing into my skin which sounds really gross

03:55:08.720 --> 03:55:17.200
said it like that um but unfortunately um not happening my my poor ill fable

03:55:19.600 --> 03:55:24.640
did they say anything about putting a chemical on it to prevent I think so I can't remember the

03:55:24.640 --> 03:55:31.760
full conversation basically the conversation was like you've got this what do you want to do this

03:55:31.760 --> 03:55:35.920
is what happens if you cut the side of it it's a possibility of coming back and because of your

03:55:35.920 --> 03:55:41.040
nail shape it's much more likely to happen again or if you just get it off it's one and done you

03:55:41.040 --> 03:55:47.280
don't have to come back um everything should be fine um I don't need antibiotics it's not like

03:55:47.280 --> 03:55:54.800
that um it's just bad um so I uh I'm just like get it over and done with I'm like I want to be in

03:55:54.800 --> 03:55:59.680
and out I want to be back streaming I don't want to have to like go back in and all that now it

03:55:59.680 --> 03:56:03.680
literally I just said now just take the whole thing off take off we gotta go bald take it off we

03:56:03.680 --> 03:56:15.520
gotta go bald um thankfully because I get to sit while I stream as opposed to someone who's forced

03:56:15.520 --> 03:56:23.440
to stand while they stream question mark anyway um the healing process isn't an issue uh because I

03:56:23.440 --> 03:56:29.200
explained I was like oh I'm I'm stronger uh I don't have to be bedridden for this and he was like

03:56:29.200 --> 03:56:35.360
nah you're fine uh if you're sitting for the full day then just sit um I need to change the bandages

03:56:35.360 --> 03:56:41.120
though which I'm a bit hmm I don't know if it's gonna be gross but I'll try my best to behave

03:56:43.040 --> 03:56:49.520
uh don't worry even if it doesn't grow back I don't care yeah I still like my my nine toenails

03:56:49.840 --> 03:56:58.240
um bandage changing oh you're feeling brave I think I think it's going to be very um

03:57:00.160 --> 03:57:06.480
not pleasant you'll have to wrap the toe up when you take a shower I could probably take a bath

03:57:06.480 --> 03:57:11.120
easier than a shower because I can just like dive into the water with my my leg out of the bath

03:57:12.240 --> 03:57:17.680
mommy's streaming from the hospital bed I probably would I'm not even joking I'd probably

03:57:18.640 --> 03:57:22.400
if I was ever in a hospital for a long time because of whatever reason

03:57:22.400 --> 03:57:27.920
I'd probably just buy a gaming laptop and port my model on it and be like right that's so let's go

03:57:27.920 --> 03:57:32.880
and then like the nurses come in and and they're like what are you doing I'm like oh don't worry

03:57:32.880 --> 03:57:38.480
about it I need me a chat need me need me up my rooflings hospitals that's who would go hard not

03:57:38.480 --> 03:57:49.200
gonna lie well we're almost at seven thousand fishies god we are getting through it the question

03:57:49.200 --> 03:57:54.240
is are we gonna finish the fishes by the endurance well you keep streaming from the shows how you

03:57:54.240 --> 03:58:01.840
raise the nurses for real for real why is it nurses are so caked up for like no reason I have a

03:58:02.560 --> 03:58:08.640
that's it I'm becoming a nurse only to get an even larger rump okay I'm gonna become a nurse

03:58:08.640 --> 03:58:14.800
so I can get a larger rump my friend had his removed forever ago it doesn't look that different

03:58:14.800 --> 03:58:21.920
just an indent where the nail was okay so true nurses have that you can play old school rinscape

03:58:21.920 --> 03:58:28.240
on your phone but I kind of stream it though oh it's the bunny reefling that I thought was telling

03:58:28.320 --> 03:58:35.360
me to hurt myself because they gave me fish food and poison the one thousand and two smelly

03:58:35.360 --> 03:58:43.840
socks in your bank that's reeflings giving me a bit but let's just say there was no there was no

03:58:43.840 --> 03:58:51.680
ink left and then strong it's your body your decision but are you feeling you might regret it

03:58:52.000 --> 03:59:03.120
I couldn't give less of a about my toes I'm gonna be honest um I don't uh they don't do anything for

03:59:03.120 --> 03:59:09.360
me I don't paint them I I'm not very feminine in terms of getting my nails and you know toes done

03:59:10.160 --> 03:59:15.760
it doesn't affect me they told me it doesn't affect my balance in any way my feet will adjust

03:59:15.760 --> 03:59:23.200
very quickly to applying pressure while walking um I'm not trying to just miss your thing but

03:59:24.000 --> 03:59:32.160
the fun part is if you put the mesh you stick thing on the bed if it comes off yeah um that

03:59:32.160 --> 03:59:38.720
hurts to take that off yeah I just it doesn't bother me I've never been into doing my nails or

03:59:38.720 --> 03:59:43.120
anything like I literally have fake press on nails to do ASMR with when I do show my hands

03:59:43.840 --> 03:59:46.720
you've been playing for a while consider taking a break from stream

03:59:47.680 --> 03:59:56.720
jaguics do not insult me do not insult me I'm being insulted by jaguics

making me scared are you guys gonna be ahead of me all of you guys getting 99 cooking without me

04:01:49.680 --> 04:02:00.480
just hilarious hypnosis when you sway back and forth and make us obey when soon um my first hypnosis

04:02:00.480 --> 04:02:06.240
is forget your name and your new name is refling you will respond to refling you will get praises

04:02:06.240 --> 04:02:11.680
refling etc and I will not have permanent effects it will be roughly 30 minutes long

04:02:12.080 --> 04:02:19.280
but it will fade away after two hours I'm gonna do a two hour fade effect I am very cautious

04:02:19.280 --> 04:02:23.280
about doing any permanent effects stuff it makes me slightly nervous

04:02:27.280 --> 04:02:32.400
strainy what if our name is already refling you already respond if I have loved you into refling

04:02:33.200 --> 04:02:37.680
refling who's been a naughty refling

04:02:40.400 --> 04:02:45.520
have you not been looking after yourself refling how are we supposed to look after each other

04:02:47.120 --> 04:02:55.200
if you don't look after yourself that's right I'm gonna guilt trip you into looking after

04:02:55.200 --> 04:03:01.200
yourself and there's nothing you can do about it I'm gonna it's over for you refling it's over

04:03:01.200 --> 04:03:07.600
before it even started okay this is true real hmm well I've already been permanently affected by

04:03:07.600 --> 04:03:19.280
you mom I stood at attention I turned up refling time to line up it's time for your daily inking

04:03:20.800 --> 04:03:27.840
what hole are you gonna get it's a surprise that's terrible why do I see these things at

04:03:27.840 --> 04:03:34.800
learn also me when my content gets limited ads hmm curious I wonder why

04:03:37.920 --> 04:03:42.560
angst on you the game is rigged my name's already been refling for a week oh wait it has

04:03:42.560 --> 04:03:48.080
literally because you're called refling in game well I like surprises sounds like a bit

04:03:48.800 --> 04:03:52.480
the game is right from the start it's inking tame not yet

04:03:55.600 --> 04:04:00.800
not yet because we like it the algorithm must be haunted

04:04:03.840 --> 04:04:10.160
actually I need to tell the girls to be careful and say more substitute words so if you didn't know

04:04:11.040 --> 04:04:16.320
youtube alt caption streams doesn't even matter for the full 12-hour reshoot triple alt caption up

04:04:16.320 --> 04:04:22.400
okay and the problem with that is that's why you need to do substitute words because it will

04:04:22.400 --> 04:04:28.400
identify the rate of things being said and it'll be so you can swear sometimes but if you swear too

04:04:28.400 --> 04:04:35.680
much you're in trouble you know what I mean so I'll need to tell the girls to maybe do some

04:04:36.640 --> 04:04:39.760
better just hear a really weird noise though is that in game

04:04:44.400 --> 04:04:45.120
anonymous

04:04:46.240 --> 04:04:51.680
strongy I was in a meeting at work today and my boss asked me if I was intentionally putting

04:04:52.640 --> 04:05:00.480
no it's over for me I'm done for anonymous no way

04:05:03.360 --> 04:05:07.680
anonymous no way you've freaking assimilated the slang

04:05:09.440 --> 04:05:13.760
are you being saying like oh are you being saying that oh I instead of like yes

04:05:13.760 --> 04:05:21.520
you're like mmm I can do that oh my god we're doing oh hang on can you um can you do this

04:05:21.600 --> 04:05:28.240
excel sheet ah I can and they're all looking at you like what you didn't tell us you're Scottish

04:05:28.240 --> 04:05:35.760
you're like uh uh uh just pull the old Brian assimilation any percent that's amazing

04:05:39.760 --> 04:05:46.320
oh Amy's Vod is totally not going to be kept off even after editing out she's already on a warning

04:05:46.880 --> 04:05:51.920
so I'm very worried about her and Amy at the stage I don't want to tell the girls like hey you

04:05:51.920 --> 04:05:57.680
need to like knock it off because that's not fun for anyone sorry my microphone is just playing

04:05:57.680 --> 04:06:02.000
a prank on me they're pranking me John the Scottish accent is funny until it's too late

04:06:04.400 --> 04:06:07.520
to be honest I've started typing I a lot more

04:06:07.760 --> 04:06:08.960
hmm

04:06:11.280 --> 04:06:15.680
how do warnings work so none of the girls have a strike on their youtube channel

04:06:16.400 --> 04:06:25.280
but they have a warning that lasts 90 days three months so if they were to do something against

04:06:25.280 --> 04:06:32.000
TOS they get a full strike which limits them for a week they can't do anything for a week

04:06:32.720 --> 04:06:37.040
um like they can't upload they can't update they can't do this they can't do that um

04:06:38.000 --> 04:06:46.560
and I am a bit nervous but as soon as the warning expires at the 90 day mark um I think

04:06:46.560 --> 04:06:57.200
all is good at that but what the heck is that what the hell oh my there's no way

04:06:57.440 --> 04:07:00.160
I'll just hold on big ass he's right

04:07:03.600 --> 04:07:10.160
um it's not messed up because it gives a warning and not a strike

04:07:11.520 --> 04:07:17.760
but the length being 90 days is pretty rough I have to admit considering youtube haven't

04:07:17.760 --> 04:07:23.200
announced their new updated TOS or their stealth TOS wherever you want to call it at this rate

04:07:23.200 --> 04:07:29.520
um it's a bit messed up because they've updated it but because they gave a warning

04:07:30.160 --> 04:07:33.520
if they gave a strike then yes I would agree and say that's really not

04:07:34.240 --> 04:07:40.800
fair because you've not you've yet to say that ASMR ear licking is against the rules yet even though

04:07:40.800 --> 04:07:50.320
you're applying it um type thing uh but yeah so I have to confess I've reached night nine cooking

04:07:50.320 --> 04:07:54.880
three times before this stream you cannot have I only started like a week ago

04:07:57.840 --> 04:08:02.960
you can't you mean before though like before you can't have done 99

04:08:04.400 --> 04:08:08.560
because that's like they say it tastes like 81 hours to do 99 or something

04:08:10.160 --> 04:08:13.840
oh Azura got a warning for Ian a QQ unfortunately yes like Azura

04:08:14.400 --> 04:08:20.960
I don't know what's going on with Azura she wanted to do an exercise ASMR stream

04:08:22.000 --> 04:08:28.480
and unfortunately management was like bruv you're gonna get a strike for that you literally

04:08:28.480 --> 04:08:34.560
got in trouble for eating a cookie what makes you think you can do heavy breathing ASMR working out

04:08:34.560 --> 04:08:41.440
and it's such a shame because I never want to say no to the girls but I don't want to risk her

04:08:41.840 --> 04:08:45.520
like her income because I know she's not monetized yet but she's about to be

04:08:45.520 --> 04:08:53.920
I do not want to risk her monetization um like if she wanted to record it and upload it like on

04:08:53.920 --> 04:08:59.520
Twitter that's fine I have no issues with that the cookie embargo honestly yeah the sounds YouTube

04:08:59.520 --> 04:09:07.520
sucks um yeah she wanted to do workout ASMR but that would result in like heavy breathing in the mic

04:09:07.520 --> 04:09:13.840
and huge I don't know what is going on at YouTube headquarters but it is absolutely

04:09:14.960 --> 04:09:19.600
going to the dogs I wish they would just come out and see what is and what isn't

04:09:19.600 --> 04:09:25.040
instead of playing this weird guessing game of like oh but that's fine oh but that's not fine

04:09:25.840 --> 04:09:27.840
oh

04:09:33.440 --> 04:09:42.960
oh my god they very curious very curious well I got a thousand likes on that ASMR video hold on

04:09:43.680 --> 04:09:52.960
in the money you may not have a cookie YouTube literally I think because Azura's voice is so

04:09:52.960 --> 04:09:59.040
silky perfection in sexu is why she got walloped with it which is a shame because it's not fair

04:09:59.040 --> 04:10:06.800
that's not fair at all um because that is just her voice I I'll tell you something in the interview

04:10:06.800 --> 04:10:12.560
with her I thought she was putting it on and she was gonna like reveal her voice to me in the

04:10:12.560 --> 04:10:17.680
interview no that's just her voice she's just straight up a goddess uh no questions asked

04:10:18.400 --> 04:10:20.400
hmm

04:10:21.920 --> 04:10:28.000
purple burglar and you're the second one you're the seven I see you see taking that

04:10:29.040 --> 04:10:35.600
um literally punished her for a default voice I thought literally um there was a lot of actually

04:10:35.600 --> 04:10:40.240
there's a really interesting thing about the uh introduce yourself videos a lot of people did

04:10:40.240 --> 04:10:45.200
their character voice that they currently like do as a vtuber and then they were like

04:10:45.200 --> 04:10:52.000
hi viewer and their actual voice um and it was quite interesting it was nice seeing the swap

04:10:52.560 --> 04:10:56.880
um and I was convinced I was like oh Azura is like yeah putting on a voice and then I did the

04:10:56.880 --> 04:11:02.880
interview and I was like oh I didn't even know people had goddess voices like this um do you

04:11:02.880 --> 04:11:06.160
know how much money I would make with your voice yes thank you uh give it to me now

04:11:07.040 --> 04:11:13.360

if someone can send me a sample of it like a timestamp

04:18:14.320 --> 04:18:15.040

04:28:29.200 --> 04:28:39.120
the the the tip link um where was I the system is set up for you to fail so you've been told your

04:28:39.120 --> 04:28:46.960
entire life oh being in debt bad debt bad and yet the most American infrastructure you have to put

04:28:46.960 --> 04:28:53.040
a down payment to get a car type thing and debt you can buy things online in four installments

04:28:53.040 --> 04:29:04.240
that's a debt and then the the worst offender of all mortgages mortgages are just normalized debt

04:29:04.240 --> 04:29:11.600
for over for norm normalized debt enslavement there is no way you can guarantee you're gonna

04:29:11.600 --> 04:29:20.960
have a perfect income for 30 years and it ah ah I could absolutely explode off the planet

04:29:22.400 --> 04:29:28.560
um they also close your account if you don't use your card anyway oh sorry what are mortgages

04:29:28.560 --> 04:29:33.680
so a mortgage is when you go to a bank and you say hello bank I would like to purchase this house

04:29:33.680 --> 04:29:42.000
the bank will then own your house that you pay a monthly mortgage into with astronomical fees

04:29:42.000 --> 04:29:48.480
over the years with the charged interest by the time you have finished off paying your lovely jubbly

04:29:48.480 --> 04:29:57.120
25 year mortgage with interest you have paid an astronomical amount that isn't even houses aren't

04:29:57.120 --> 04:30:04.560
even valued the materials of houses aren't even at that value the construction isn't even at that

04:30:04.560 --> 04:30:15.120
value the entire system is rigged it is rigaton needs to high heavens do not ever feel embarrassed

04:30:15.120 --> 04:30:21.680
about still living at home with your parents do not ever feel embarrassed if you're in real life

04:30:21.680 --> 04:30:30.720
friends from high school or whatever have moved out are able to rent do not ever feel embarrassed

04:30:30.720 --> 04:30:39.360
about any of these aspects you the system is rigged against you do not feel a shred of it

04:30:40.000 --> 04:30:49.280
multi-generational living was incredibly common for centuries way before capitalism came into the

04:30:49.280 --> 04:30:55.920
picture do not be embarrassed about living with your maw living with your grand that is your sense

04:30:55.920 --> 04:31:03.280
of community is beautiful to even have that and I would absolutely love to see the uprising of

04:31:03.280 --> 04:31:10.400
multi-generational households I would absolutely love to see the uprising of people going back to

04:31:11.040 --> 04:31:21.840
another thing in world war one in world war two people on mass were instructed on how to grow

04:31:21.840 --> 04:31:30.880
vegetables at home with the rise of supermarkets capitalism who here knows someone who grows

04:31:30.960 --> 04:31:39.040
produce themselves I know no one I know no one that grows produce themselves

04:31:39.920 --> 04:31:47.680
because of how how much lack of time people have maybe your grand might do it because she has time

04:31:47.680 --> 04:31:55.280
because she's retired did you know how common it was to have a farm to have farm animals such as

04:31:55.280 --> 04:32:02.160
chickens how common it was to grow even the most basic of vegetable such as potatoes such as

04:32:02.160 --> 04:32:14.160
tomatoes such as peas okay you I want to see this become a thing I want another thing another

04:32:14.160 --> 04:32:22.720
thing notice how tiny gardens are getting for houses hmm I wonder put your tin plastic someone

04:32:22.720 --> 04:32:29.440

04:33:07.280 --> 04:33:16.320
where is it hey let's go okay let's clip it to my my head hold on you feel like right and well um

04:33:16.320 --> 04:33:24.160
at it sorry I just jumped up there in excitement um and well I'm at it hmm isn't it curious that

04:33:24.160 --> 04:33:30.640
garden spaces for the average house have been lessening and lessening every year I wonder

04:33:31.440 --> 04:33:37.600
do they want the people not to have the ability to grow produce in the means of their own production

04:33:37.680 --> 04:33:46.160
for survival isn't that curious isn't that curious that flats but massive sky scraping

04:33:46.160 --> 04:33:52.640
building blocks have no garden space so people cannot produce their own produce their own vegetables

04:33:52.640 --> 04:34:02.480
their own fruits their own herbs so people are forced to rely on supermarkets yet again capitalism

04:34:02.560 --> 04:34:10.800
strikes isn't that curious I find that so curious at this day and age with all these

04:34:10.800 --> 04:34:15.840
advancements and buildings so many houses the garden spaces are getting so tiny you cannot

04:34:15.840 --> 04:34:22.400
even have a produce producing tree and isn't it curious that even when there are fruit producing

04:34:22.400 --> 04:34:30.160
trees um that they purposely don't have fruit producing trees when they have to put trees down

04:34:30.160 --> 04:34:35.280
instead they use pollen trees um which are good I don't get me wrong they're good for the bugs

04:34:35.280 --> 04:34:42.080
but they never give free produce producing trees I freaking saw a story where someone um got given

04:34:42.080 --> 04:34:47.200
lemons from the garden and she didn't know that you could just straight up cut the lemon open and add

04:34:47.200 --> 04:34:52.960
it to the juice they thought it had to be produced isn't it interesting that in school you hardly

04:34:52.960 --> 04:34:58.720
learn about the cycle of the farmers and how you never are encouraged to go to farmers markets

04:34:58.800 --> 04:35:02.880
instead of the big freaking Tescos are big as their big this or big that

04:35:03.920 --> 04:35:10.320
talk your shit damn straight I'll talk my shit isn't that interesting that you hardly even learn

04:35:10.320 --> 04:35:16.880
about seeds seeds I will tell you about seeds right now to remember the three threat factors

04:35:16.880 --> 04:35:24.080
of growing seeds it's what wot water oxygen temperature that is how you grow seeds

04:35:24.480 --> 04:35:31.200
um the other part of fun is when Monsanto tries to sue people for using their seeds

04:35:31.200 --> 04:35:36.960
and another thing there's states where you can't even collect rain water it is illegal to collect

04:35:36.960 --> 04:35:44.480
rain water what would you use for rain water hmm you would water your own crops with rain water

04:35:44.480 --> 04:35:58.320
bro the system is beyond bull don't look too deep into it or you're not gonna enjoy what you see

04:35:59.120 --> 04:36:05.200
you have to look around and say we live in a society that's all we can do we flings

04:36:06.640 --> 04:36:13.680
we live in a society amen okay i'ma get off my soapbox for a minute there

04:36:14.800 --> 04:36:21.200
let me remove this asset no let me remove my tinfoil hat but don't think I won't put that

04:36:21.200 --> 04:36:28.640
hat back on hold on actually I have this hat okay we can put this hat on we're back to meman

04:36:31.440 --> 04:36:38.480
okay it's a bit wonky but that's really wonky right above calm down we live in a society

04:36:38.800 --> 04:36:45.680
oh thank you for letting me rant about that but it makes you think wait it's illegal to

04:36:45.680 --> 04:36:53.040
collect rain water yes but is that because it might drinking water might be contaminated

04:36:53.040 --> 04:37:01.360
why do you think that's contaminated is it because these mega corporations bribe their way into being

04:37:01.360 --> 04:37:08.080
allowed to pollute the waters did you know in the uk there is no swimmable rivers

04:37:09.920 --> 04:37:18.640
that are not toxic for they're all actively being polluted in did you know that all in the name of

04:37:18.720 --> 04:37:28.800
what reaplings capitalism shopping behavior sorry I took my tinfoil hat off zero yes zero

04:37:33.040 --> 04:37:36.240
by the way I also have a friend who has like 20 different crops growing in his

04:37:36.240 --> 04:37:42.880
basement so a garden is technically not needed and that should that gentleman be having those crops

04:37:43.200 --> 04:37:49.600
right I'll get oh pardon me I'll get off my horse um I think I may need to eat for I haven't

04:37:49.600 --> 04:37:54.080
eaten anything at all to do in fact I've only had a cup of tea and a half bottle of water it's not

04:37:54.080 --> 04:38:06.640
looking good for me so yes um I will do another batch so when strong is farm airing on BBC

04:38:06.640 --> 04:38:11.840
oh they'd never let me air it I'd be going nuts yeah actually well I'll go back for a little bit

04:38:11.840 --> 04:38:16.480
it's not too tinfoil hat during world war one and world war two where food scarcity was a thing

04:38:17.040 --> 04:38:20.640
in the modern day age food scarcity is not a thing please do not be under the impression

04:38:20.640 --> 04:38:30.000
is scarce is a lie um food scarcity was a thing so people were encouraged to grow farms and to do

04:38:30.000 --> 04:38:37.440
very unique plots to do legumes to do potatoes to do cabbage the most staple foods you can imagine

04:38:38.000 --> 04:38:45.520
and with the uprising of supermarkets people stopped doing it and who benefits who benefits

04:38:45.520 --> 04:38:53.200
when we the individuals the small communities no longer grow our own crops no longer have

04:38:53.920 --> 04:39:02.080
thingy we are fully reliant on the system which is not good you never want to fully rely on the

04:39:02.160 --> 04:39:07.840
system but guess what if you don't want to rely on the system what do you need oh well you need

04:39:07.840 --> 04:39:14.400
a plot of land to grow okay and you need time but wait a minute even if I fully outright buy

04:39:14.400 --> 04:39:21.920
my plot of land wait a minute I still have to play some to pay some sort of yearly land tax

04:39:22.640 --> 04:39:30.080
um towards the place that I'm living in because there's no place that's truly free there you can

04:39:30.080 --> 04:39:36.000
you buy a house in UK and every year you pay council tax even if you don't participate in the

04:39:36.000 --> 04:39:42.880
services that they provide um you do it in Australia they have a thing called land tax in America they

04:39:42.880 --> 04:39:50.960
have a thing called something tax even when you want to fully no longer be a part of the system

04:39:50.960 --> 04:39:57.360
they already got you hook line and sinker um and it doesn't matter what you do you can't escape it

04:39:57.360 --> 04:40:07.680
anyway um that's me property ownership tax yet farmers are struggling yep so um every time uh

04:40:09.200 --> 04:40:15.840
there is a there was a shortage in Australia recently this happened a couple of months back

04:40:15.840 --> 04:40:21.920
now though um there was a shortages of eggs and the prices went up because there was a shortage

04:40:21.920 --> 04:40:25.600
of course that makes sense so more people are wanting eggs but there's less eggs uh

04:40:26.080 --> 04:40:33.600
hold on a minute what's going on here we're in the information age a major um a major

04:40:34.480 --> 04:40:41.040
major um egg producer in Australia came out and said um actually there's nothing wrong with

04:40:41.040 --> 04:40:47.680
production at all if you want to know the truth um they're actually not giving us um as much money

04:40:47.680 --> 04:40:52.480
as they used to and yet the prices are going up and we don't get to see any of that benefit

04:40:53.280 --> 04:41:00.640
are you telling me these mega corporations are artificially hold on let's be honest

04:41:01.600 --> 04:41:07.920
are you telling me these mega corporation wait how is there two how did i do that hold on a minute

04:41:07.920 --> 04:41:16.880
hold on a minute i need to put my tinfoil hat back on no it can't be that all these mega corporations

04:41:16.880 --> 04:41:25.280
are actually hand in hand with one another no wait you mean the cost of living crisis

04:41:25.280 --> 04:41:32.640
is actually artificial because if one shop raises their prices the other shop can justify that

04:41:33.440 --> 04:41:39.760
but then the major no that can't be right because capitalism obviously brief what the

04:41:39.760 --> 04:41:45.680
frick is that rune play that's very grand sitting on that table but that oh no that can't be right

04:41:45.680 --> 04:41:58.080
no the good businesses aren't wait a minute coca cola owns all of the market wait but i thought

04:41:58.080 --> 04:42:05.840
capitals and bread competition no no everything i've been told that's not right wait a minute

04:42:06.720 --> 04:42:13.520
hmm something's not adding up coca cola seems to own literally everything wait a minute who is

04:42:13.520 --> 04:42:21.920
the sole business owner because everything seems to be getting acquired wait wait a minute it's a

04:42:21.920 --> 04:42:28.560
conglomerate everything is a fucking conglomerate and they can put up the prices as much as they

04:42:28.560 --> 04:42:36.160
please because there's no true competition even if there were cheaper brands that wanted to get on

04:42:36.160 --> 04:42:44.560
the shelves brands have to pay to be on the shelves in your common supermarkets holy moly

04:42:46.000 --> 04:42:54.160
my head's spinning just thinking about how deep this rabbit hole goes maybe we should focus on the

04:42:54.160 --> 04:43:00.320
one rabbit hole that's important to us and that's shebe's hole we love you shebe we hope you feel

04:48:25.480 --> 04:48:35.480
Do you hear it? Reefling's Blackrock is coming for strongy. She knows too much. And they are coming for you too, Skull.

04:48:55.480 --> 04:49:05.480
Do you hear it? Reefling is coming for strongy. She knows too much.

04:49:25.480 --> 04:49:49.480
Reefling is coming for strongy. She knows too much.

04:49:49.480 --> 04:50:18.480
Reefling is coming for strongy. She knows too much.

04:50:19.480 --> 04:50:48.480
Reefling is coming for strongy. She knows too much.

04:50:49.480 --> 04:51:18.480
Reefling is coming for strongy. She knows too much.

04:51:19.480 --> 04:51:45.480
Reefling is coming for strongy. She knows too much.

04:51:45.480 --> 04:51:52.480
Did you tinkle? Did you tinkle? Let me see. You never let me hold it. You never let me hold it.

04:51:52.480 --> 04:51:54.480
You've got to hold three minutes. I was away.

04:51:54.480 --> 04:51:57.480
Day 100, still no mummy in sight.

04:51:57.480 --> 04:52:00.480
She died of a leafling.

04:52:00.480 --> 04:52:07.480
Oh boy. Do you hear it? Reefling's Blackrock is coming for strongy. She knows too much. And they are coming for you too. No!

04:52:07.480 --> 04:52:12.480
Thank you for the tip boy.

04:52:12.480 --> 04:52:18.480
No, I think I have got my mesh back.

04:52:18.480 --> 04:52:28.480
I will refrain from any more tin foil unless you guys get me started again then I just can't help myself.

04:52:28.480 --> 04:52:35.480
I have a can of cola. I have a honey tea which I need some help with the reference with.

04:52:35.480 --> 04:52:43.480
I have a Nutri-Grain Bar, a Nature Valley Crunch Bar and a blueberry muffin. I can't really make it make a noise.

04:52:43.480 --> 04:52:49.480
I can smack the bottom of the casing. I don't know if you can hear that.

04:52:49.480 --> 04:52:58.480
But that is pretty much what's going on in my food. That's still too much.

04:52:58.480 --> 04:53:04.480
I really remember it being that one. Maybe it's my head set. I wouldn't be surprised.

04:53:04.480 --> 04:53:07.480
She came back. She loves us. Of course I do.

04:53:07.480 --> 04:53:13.480
Remember that time I thought I wasn't going to come back? That was rough. That was rough.

04:53:13.480 --> 04:53:16.480
And then I come back. I come back even stronger.

04:53:16.480 --> 04:53:27.480
Yes, for endurance streams it's not possible for me to prepare food. Unless I did it in advance but I'm a lazy fud.

04:53:27.480 --> 04:53:34.480
So I've bought a load of drive food or food that is zero prep time.

04:53:34.480 --> 04:53:42.480
I don't have any boiled eggs. I ate all my boiled eggs. And my meat sticks have kind of overstayed their welcome.

04:53:42.480 --> 04:53:47.480
No, no, no. I'm going to take a bite of my muffin though.

04:53:47.480 --> 04:53:55.480
I did not realise I had been streaming for five hours and I've literally had nothing but a cup of tea and a half bottle of water. That's outrageous.

04:53:55.480 --> 04:54:00.480
That's how distracted you guys get me. That's how much I freaking love it.

04:54:00.480 --> 04:54:09.480
Oh my goodness. I'm going to take a bite of my muffin. I do apologise if I'm not talking for a few moments.

04:54:09.480 --> 04:54:12.480
I eat my muffin. Itadakimasu.

04:54:17.480 --> 04:54:23.480
Oh my goodness. It's mason jelly.

04:54:23.480 --> 04:54:27.480
Oh yeah, we distract you. Yeah.

04:54:27.480 --> 04:54:35.480
I can't believe it. I can't believe we really enjoy each other's company. It's crazy. It's a crazy concept.

04:54:35.480 --> 04:54:41.480
I honestly couldn't imagine being a VTuber that hates our audience.

04:54:41.480 --> 04:54:44.480
Why are you even streaming?

04:54:44.480 --> 04:54:49.480
Because I'm pretty sure I have heard a few stories like that where they're like, oh I hate what I do.

04:54:49.480 --> 04:54:55.480
I'm like, well if you hate what you do, go clock out and do something else. What the fuck?

04:54:55.480 --> 04:54:59.480
You don't enjoy your time? The fuck? How can you not enjoy your time?

04:54:59.480 --> 04:55:04.480
Actually, while I'm on my high horse about VTubers now, how can you not enjoy your time?

04:55:04.480 --> 04:55:08.480
You dictated everything you get to do. You don't have to do a single thing.

04:55:08.480 --> 04:55:11.480
If you want to play a game, play a game. If you don't want to play a game, don't play a game.

04:55:11.480 --> 04:55:15.480
If you want to zazoo, zazoo. If you don't want to zazoo, don't zazoo.

04:55:15.480 --> 04:55:21.480
Wait a minute. What's going on? I refuse to believe there's any VTubers that stream that actually don't like streaming.

04:55:21.480 --> 04:55:26.480
Because you get to pick everything. Does that make sense?

04:55:27.480 --> 04:55:35.480
The Elden Ring DLC comes out and I get to do nothing but play with you guys for, friggin, what?

04:55:35.480 --> 04:55:41.480
Half a week more? Maybe more? Actually, maybe five sessions. I have no idea how big the DLC is.

04:55:41.480 --> 04:55:46.480
I don't even know if they've given an indication on how big the DLC is.

04:55:49.480 --> 04:55:51.480
I just want money for existing proof rule.

04:55:51.480 --> 04:55:57.480
And another thing about capitalism. I'll stop. No more hi-hat. No more tinfoil for now.

04:55:57.480 --> 04:56:00.480
I will burn you out on my conspiracy theories.

04:56:00.480 --> 04:56:12.480
T minus one hour, I believe, for our lovely goat goddess, the goddess of fertility.

04:56:12.480 --> 04:56:18.480
Or mummy, literally she is your mummy canonically, lore-wise. She is quite literally your mum.

04:56:22.480 --> 04:56:28.480
It was enough to be nearly a full game. Okay, might need to change up my plan for the fourth week.

04:56:28.480 --> 04:56:34.480
Do you want to hold it, strongy? The DLC. I want to stack donuts on it, and don't say no.

04:56:34.480 --> 04:56:39.480
Okay, if it's like, wait, are we going to do a full week of Elden Ring then?

04:56:40.480 --> 04:56:41.480
Hmm.

04:56:43.480 --> 04:56:49.480
If we do a full week of Elden Ring, on the fourth week, I will make up for any membership content.

04:56:49.480 --> 04:56:53.480
Like, I will literally do back-to-back, back-to-back, back-to-back, member streams.

04:56:53.480 --> 04:56:57.480
Like, you know, I'll do it. I'll do it to make up.

04:56:59.480 --> 04:57:02.480
Shora, thank you for becoming a member.

04:57:02.480 --> 04:57:04.480
And everything.

04:57:04.480 --> 04:57:07.480
Does that sound like something you'd find in stacked donuts?

04:57:16.480 --> 04:57:21.480
Oh, I tell you what, I was doing my research on a game that I might play.

04:57:21.480 --> 04:57:28.480
It's called Boutro. It is a poker-type game.

04:57:28.480 --> 04:57:35.480
And, unfortunately, I'm not very familiar with the old straight flush, flush, royal flush, or whatever.

04:57:35.480 --> 04:57:39.480
The only flush I do is after I drop a big jobby in the toilet.

04:57:39.480 --> 04:57:47.480
And I was, it looks pretty easy to play, in terms of me actually being good, that's a different story.

04:57:47.480 --> 04:57:52.480
However, it looked like a cam to our game experience.

04:57:52.480 --> 04:57:56.480
So, I was doing my research, I was watching people play, and I'm like,

04:57:56.480 --> 04:58:00.480
Oh, yes, I understand none of this. So, I'm going to look at a few more tutorials.

04:58:00.480 --> 04:58:04.480
But we might give Boutro a little try. I'll be one of my shorter streams.

04:58:04.480 --> 04:58:08.480
Not the new Tinkle.

04:58:08.480 --> 04:58:12.480
The guys, whenever you poop, do you always pee as well?

04:58:15.480 --> 04:58:17.480
I think it's the same for guys.

04:58:17.480 --> 04:58:24.480
I do know a secret, though. If you move your fireman's hose, your butthole clenches.

04:58:24.480 --> 04:58:31.480
I've never been the same since I learned that fact on the internet. The internet has scarred me for that fact.

04:58:31.480 --> 04:58:36.480
See, you're all twitching your buttholes right now, I can tell.

04:58:36.480 --> 04:58:40.480
Reef flings. I can't believe you're doing it in unison.

04:58:41.480 --> 04:58:42.480
Okay.

04:58:42.480 --> 04:58:46.480
I have finished my mini muffin.

04:58:46.480 --> 04:58:50.480
I'm going to open up my cola to wash it down.

04:58:53.480 --> 04:58:59.480
Honestly, I was worried about eating on stream, but it's really easy to eat in Playbroonscape at the same time.

04:58:59.480 --> 04:59:04.480
I twitch butthole for a moment. Reef flings together strong.

04:59:04.480 --> 04:59:10.480
We can also manually twitch your fireman's hose, but can you do it without twitching the butthole?

04:59:10.480 --> 04:59:14.480
No, you can't. Apparently, it's guys' biology that you can't.

04:59:22.480 --> 04:59:23.480
Wah.

04:59:23.480 --> 04:59:26.480
Wah, bit of cola.

04:59:26.480 --> 04:59:29.480
Man, by the po- wait, wait, wait, wait, hold on a minute.

04:59:29.480 --> 04:59:35.480
I was just calling me hypocritical because I just talked about corporations, and then I'm currently eating and drinking cola.

04:59:35.480 --> 04:59:40.480
Man, as if I can source this stuff myself in the wild.

04:59:40.480 --> 04:59:45.480
Who else is going to give me my sugary nectar?

04:59:45.480 --> 04:59:47.480
What's that? I got you.

04:59:47.480 --> 04:59:54.480
I'm currently open my nature valley. I have a bowl to eat it in because I just know it's going to go everywhere.

04:59:55.480 --> 04:59:59.480
Wow, we're almost at a million eggs P.

05:00:02.480 --> 05:00:06.480
Look, 730,000.

05:00:10.480 --> 05:00:16.480
Tea? Did you just snipe that? I think he just snipped that little thing there.

05:00:19.480 --> 05:00:22.480
I'd like to check out mommy's nature valley.

05:00:22.480 --> 05:00:26.480
I thought a certain type of exercise could give you that kind of control over the muscles.

05:00:26.480 --> 05:00:29.480
Do you guys want to do kegels together?

05:00:29.480 --> 05:00:35.480
And whole, two, three, and release, two, three, and whole, two, three.

05:00:35.480 --> 05:00:39.480
That's terrible. Don't encourage me. Don't get me started.

05:00:39.480 --> 05:00:45.480
Not only will we have, oh my god, I'm trying to take the nature valley out without it crumbling everywhere.

05:00:45.480 --> 05:00:52.480
I have the, I have a Canadian maple syrup flavor at nature valley.

05:00:52.480 --> 05:00:58.480
I got a box that has like three different flavors inside and I just grabbed one because I had to tinkle.

05:00:58.480 --> 05:01:01.480
Whoa, wait, how fast is this one?

05:01:02.480 --> 05:01:07.480
Mmm, it's a ham. Oh, gosh.

05:01:12.480 --> 05:01:15.480
I'm sorry if we got like eating time.

05:01:20.480 --> 05:01:27.480
I'm off to buy groceries, enjoy the shop, try your best to shop local, smile.

05:01:28.480 --> 05:01:33.480
Whoa, that's like respawn so fast. That's 30K every second.

05:01:38.480 --> 05:01:43.480
Mmm, am I going crazy? Why is that spawning so fast?

05:01:43.480 --> 05:01:46.480
Is it like in a van or something?

05:01:46.480 --> 05:01:53.480
Mommy's through it, she doesn't need a lift of 22 million and I'm like, oh my god, is that 30K? That's amazing.

05:01:54.480 --> 05:02:01.480
Mmm, yes, I'm enjoying. Is Gimli still fine? No, she's asleep. I'll just sneak around her.

05:02:04.480 --> 05:02:08.480
What was that? Oh no, it wasn't me that leveled up. I take another big bite.

05:02:08.480 --> 05:02:11.480
Wow. Wow.

05:02:12.480 --> 05:02:15.480
Mmm.

05:02:15.480 --> 05:02:25.480
Bye bye, don't worry if you have to go, this is an endurance stream. I did not expect anyone to sit for 12 hours with me on RuneScape Wall.

05:02:25.480 --> 05:02:27.480
Mmm.

05:02:27.480 --> 05:02:32.480
Someone's dropping them. Why would they do that?

05:02:32.480 --> 05:02:35.480
How rather odd.

05:02:36.480 --> 05:02:41.480
Is he just giving them a week?

05:02:41.480 --> 05:02:44.480
But what if we wanted to?

05:02:44.480 --> 05:02:46.480
Ah, we're not supposed to.

05:02:54.480 --> 05:02:56.480
How bizarre.

05:02:57.480 --> 05:03:05.480
Mmm, no, I think it might be bad for your health to watch me for 12 hours. I'm going to be gone in.

05:03:05.480 --> 05:03:08.480
Mmm, 70.

05:03:08.480 --> 05:03:11.480
Oh my god, we hit 70.

05:03:11.480 --> 05:03:18.480
We're only just over the five hour mark. Can we do 80? Is that too much of a reach?

05:03:18.480 --> 05:03:21.480
To do 80?

05:03:27.480 --> 05:03:32.480
Mmm.

05:03:32.480 --> 05:03:38.480
This shit fucking flaky is anything, man. Nature Valley, count your days.

05:03:38.480 --> 05:03:42.480
That's outrageously crumbly.

05:03:45.480 --> 05:03:50.480
Chat summary shocked you. What does chat summary say?

05:03:57.480 --> 05:04:02.480
What's your favorite snack?

05:04:02.480 --> 05:04:11.480
I don't even know, that's just too many to choose from. Something salty probably. It went from 70 to 76.

05:04:11.480 --> 05:04:16.480
Good 6am morning, never woke up this early.

05:04:16.480 --> 05:04:21.480
Wait, you're up early to watch the stream? Don't do that, get rest, you need rest.

05:04:21.480 --> 05:04:28.480
Wait, where did the time go? Last I looked it was 97 minutes in. No.

05:04:28.480 --> 05:04:35.480
Can you guys see what the chat summary says? Can you post it? Or is it not going to let you post it? Cause I can't see it.

05:04:35.480 --> 05:04:39.480
Cause I'm strumming. I'm strumming my badge.

05:04:40.480 --> 05:04:45.480
Ah.

05:04:48.480 --> 05:04:52.480
I haven't played whole night, is it good?

05:05:00.480 --> 05:05:07.480
Wait, well, that's what the chat... That's what the chat says?

05:05:10.480 --> 05:05:14.480
That's what the chat summary is on my freaking stream?

05:05:14.480 --> 05:05:21.480
Wait, wait, another conspiracy theory, but I did not mention that we want to take them...

05:05:21.480 --> 05:05:25.480
Rockwell. Hold on a minute.

05:05:25.480 --> 05:05:29.480
I went to play Old School RuneSafe, what's a good reason to give it a try?

05:05:29.480 --> 05:05:35.480
Number go up, serotonin, every time number go up, yippee. That's your summary.

05:05:36.480 --> 05:05:41.480
What's your favorite Pokemans? I don't know, there's too many.

05:05:41.480 --> 05:05:44.480
There's too many Pokemans to decide from, and you know that.

05:05:44.480 --> 05:05:49.480
There's literally, isn't there not like over a thousand now? I'm pretty sure.

05:05:53.480 --> 05:05:58.480
Autism game, to be honest. No, is it actually?

05:05:58.480 --> 05:06:02.480
Oh, you know who I like?

05:06:02.480 --> 05:06:07.480
You know who I like, what Pokemon I like, but it sounds like a freaking racist name.

05:06:07.480 --> 05:06:10.480
Sorry, that was so off topic.

05:06:10.480 --> 05:06:20.480
Yeah, so there's this Pokemon called Qing Ling, and it sounds so racist, and I'm like, bruv, it's ridiculous.

05:06:26.480 --> 05:06:30.480
But it's a cute Pokemon, I like the way it looks, it looks really adorable.

05:06:30.480 --> 05:06:33.480
Yeah, the cute little bell one, yeah.

05:06:33.480 --> 05:06:38.480
I just, the name just like, I'm like, I'm not sure how I feel about that.

05:06:38.480 --> 05:06:41.480
17 point name, Burnry. Oh, it has gone down.

05:06:41.480 --> 05:06:45.480
Only Tism Havers here, we only have Tism around these parts.

05:06:45.480 --> 05:06:48.480
We don't have them functioning brains.

05:06:49.480 --> 05:06:52.480
Mm, mm, mm, mm, mm, mm.

05:06:56.480 --> 05:06:59.480
Qing Ling is the sound it makes, what are you saying?

05:07:01.480 --> 05:07:06.480
That sounds like a weird name.

05:07:06.480 --> 05:07:09.480
My favourite Pokemon is Mega Yum.

05:07:09.480 --> 05:07:12.480
I quite like, what's his name?

05:07:13.480 --> 05:07:17.480
Is it Aaron? Aaron?

05:07:17.480 --> 05:07:21.480
The wee Aaron guy, he's so cute and tiny.

05:07:21.480 --> 05:07:25.480
And he eats Aaron, he's so cute.

05:07:25.480 --> 05:07:28.480
You thinking of Penicillin, what?

05:07:28.480 --> 05:07:31.480
Penicillin, Penicillin.

05:07:33.480 --> 05:07:35.480
Absol, Absol?

05:07:36.480 --> 05:07:39.480
Aaron is cutie.

05:07:40.480 --> 05:07:42.480
Where am I getting distracted?

05:07:42.480 --> 05:07:47.480
I'm not, I'm not, I'm not Mega, ugh, I'm not maxing on my swordy fishies.

05:07:47.480 --> 05:07:52.480
I definitely am going to finish all the swordfishes though, which is amazing.

05:07:52.480 --> 05:07:55.480
I'll need to go buy something at the Grand Exchange.

05:07:55.480 --> 05:07:59.480
Sorry, if you heard my stomach rumble, they are illichid and internal fire.

05:07:59.480 --> 05:08:03.480
Those plate bodies are getting suspiciously close to us now.

05:08:03.480 --> 05:08:06.480
What an error, they're getting so close.

05:08:07.480 --> 05:08:10.480
Mine is Nidoran.

05:08:10.480 --> 05:08:12.480
Oh really?

05:08:12.480 --> 05:08:16.480
I remember when Pokemon Go came out, I was really digging it.

05:08:19.480 --> 05:08:21.480
Look at the bunny's dancing.

05:08:21.480 --> 05:08:25.480
Oh, they're doing like a perfect, you know, I can't remember what it's called,

05:08:25.480 --> 05:08:29.480
but that's like English culture when you stand around a pole and all dance around it.

05:08:29.480 --> 05:08:32.480
That sounded like another type of dance,

05:08:32.480 --> 05:08:37.480
but no, it's like actually English culture, like back in the old days type thing.

05:08:39.480 --> 05:08:42.480
Why are we on the same wavelength again?

05:08:42.480 --> 05:08:44.480
God damn it, streamer.

05:08:45.480 --> 05:08:47.480
I'm just trying to, you can't keep doing this,

05:08:47.480 --> 05:08:50.480
you can't keep saying everything that I'm thinking.

05:08:53.480 --> 05:08:55.480
Gardevoir, Hypno-R.

05:08:55.480 --> 05:08:58.480
I do, I've always enjoyed Gardevoir thoroughly.

05:08:58.480 --> 05:09:00.480
Enjoyed Gardevoir.

05:09:00.480 --> 05:09:04.480
Very cool, unique and different design.

05:09:04.480 --> 05:09:07.480
Color scheme as well, very unique.

05:09:07.480 --> 05:09:10.480
God damn it, how many plate bodies does this person got?

05:09:12.480 --> 05:09:16.480
Oh my god, wait, everyone's like walking towards the, as well.

05:09:19.480 --> 05:09:21.480
What, how much was that, 3 million?

05:09:22.480 --> 05:09:24.480
Is this a refling doing this?

05:09:24.480 --> 05:09:26.480
Am I going crazy?

05:09:27.480 --> 05:09:29.480
What's plate body 4 for defense?

05:09:29.480 --> 05:09:31.480
They are free.

05:09:32.480 --> 05:09:35.480
But why give it away for free, didn't you know?

05:09:35.480 --> 05:09:37.480
Are you squinting me right now?

05:09:37.480 --> 05:09:38.480
What?

05:09:43.480 --> 05:09:45.480
Thank you, boy, for the tip.

05:09:45.480 --> 05:09:47.480
Wait, we can't both be holding at the same time.

05:09:48.480 --> 05:09:51.480
Well, my hands are relatively small.

05:09:52.480 --> 05:09:54.480
Thank you for the tip.

05:09:56.480 --> 05:09:59.480
You probably like her art too, huh?

05:09:59.480 --> 05:10:01.480
Yeah, what are you going to do about it?

05:10:01.480 --> 05:10:02.480
One look.

05:10:02.480 --> 05:10:04.480
Sorry, I only mow my hands.

05:10:04.480 --> 05:10:06.480
Two hands is fine.

05:10:06.480 --> 05:10:08.480
He keeps answering you strongly, but yeah, it's a refling.

05:10:08.480 --> 05:10:09.480
Okay.

05:10:11.480 --> 05:10:14.480
I think he's trying to give you a nice valuable thing.

05:10:14.480 --> 05:10:15.480
It wasn't me.

05:10:15.480 --> 05:10:17.480
Oh wait, am I supposed to chase after it?

05:10:17.480 --> 05:10:20.480
I'm so sorry, refling, if I'm supposed to chase after it.

05:10:20.480 --> 05:10:22.480
Oh my god, streamer distracted.

05:10:22.480 --> 05:10:24.480
I'm so dumb, I'm a streamer.

05:10:24.480 --> 05:10:26.480
I'm just a streamer.

05:10:26.480 --> 05:10:30.480
I stream my life away.

05:10:32.480 --> 05:10:33.480
Away.

05:10:35.480 --> 05:10:37.480
I'm just a refling.

05:10:37.480 --> 05:10:42.480
I stream snipe my life away.

05:10:44.480 --> 05:10:45.480
Away.

05:10:47.480 --> 05:10:49.480
68, 16 points.

05:10:49.480 --> 05:10:50.480
Oh, the burn rate went up.

05:10:50.480 --> 05:10:51.480
I got a little too excited there.

05:10:51.480 --> 05:10:52.480
Hold on a minute.

05:10:52.480 --> 05:10:54.480
I think it's because it's reset.

05:10:54.480 --> 05:10:57.480
The burn rate will kind of go up until...

05:10:57.480 --> 05:10:59.480
M.E.B. so you're under arrest?

05:10:59.480 --> 05:11:01.480
That guy said it at the NPC says.

05:11:01.480 --> 05:11:03.480
I'm focused on the grind.

05:11:03.480 --> 05:11:05.480
You don't want me a grind?

05:11:05.480 --> 05:11:07.480
Come on, mate, come on, mate.

05:11:10.480 --> 05:11:12.480
Why would M.E.B. under arrest?

05:11:12.480 --> 05:11:14.480
There should be pin pals under arrest.

05:11:23.480 --> 05:11:27.480
I'm not really enjoying this bar anymore.

05:11:27.480 --> 05:11:30.480
Rather flavorless, isn't it, bro?

05:11:31.480 --> 05:11:34.480
I'm tempted to order takeaway, I'm going to be honest.

05:11:34.480 --> 05:11:35.480
I'm like...

05:11:35.480 --> 05:11:37.480
I'm doing an insurance stream.

05:11:37.480 --> 05:11:39.480
I deserve a cheeky takeaway.

05:11:39.480 --> 05:11:41.480
I'm such a good girl.

05:11:41.480 --> 05:11:43.480
Why should I not get cheeky takeaway?

05:11:44.480 --> 05:11:46.480
Pizza, nah.

05:11:46.480 --> 05:11:48.480
Not pizza.

05:11:48.480 --> 05:11:51.480
Australian pizza, I'm sorry, Australia.

05:11:51.480 --> 05:11:53.480
And any Australian Muslim?

05:11:53.480 --> 05:11:55.480
Australian pizza is...

05:11:55.480 --> 05:11:56.480
No, thank you.

05:11:56.480 --> 05:11:58.480
I've not had one pizza I've enjoyed here.

05:11:58.480 --> 05:12:00.480
It's just full of grease.

05:12:00.480 --> 05:12:03.480
The grease is dripping off the thing.

05:12:03.480 --> 05:12:07.480
They could have blotted it or patted it or whatever, but they don't.

05:12:10.480 --> 05:12:12.480
Cheeky little treat, perhaps.

05:12:12.480 --> 05:12:16.480
I'm bringing you all with me as I buy a pizza before a storm hits.

05:12:16.480 --> 05:12:18.480
Oh, you're actually getting a pizza in real life.

05:12:22.480 --> 05:12:24.480
Didn't Emmy burn down buildings?

05:12:24.480 --> 05:12:29.480
Look, Emmy needs XP in order to summon her brother back.

05:12:29.480 --> 05:12:32.480
It's, look, whatever she does, as long as we can look the other way.

05:12:32.480 --> 05:12:36.480
The fact she's not, actually, now that I mention it, the fact she's not even in jail.

05:12:36.480 --> 05:12:42.480
How would she be evading jail when she just uses her magic on people who try and stop her?

05:12:42.480 --> 05:12:45.480
Or maybe she has, like, influential magic.

05:12:45.480 --> 05:12:49.480
I wouldn't be surprised if she had, like, turned the other eye type of spells.

05:12:50.480 --> 05:12:53.480
Where it was like, oh, must have been the wind.

05:12:53.480 --> 05:12:57.480
I wouldn't be surprised if she had access to that.

05:12:57.480 --> 05:12:59.480
And her wee totems.

05:13:02.480 --> 05:13:04.480
High charisma, yeah.

05:13:06.480 --> 05:13:10.480
She has to rescue Nissan from the devil herself.

05:13:10.480 --> 05:13:12.480
Like, Maggie Thatcher?

05:13:12.480 --> 05:13:14.480
I think people were so confused.

05:13:14.480 --> 05:13:18.480
They were like, why'd the devil herself, and then Maggie Thatcher?

05:13:18.480 --> 05:13:20.480
And it was a surprise.

05:13:20.480 --> 05:13:24.480
There was a Scottish person on the development team, and we thought the gag was hilarious.

05:13:24.480 --> 05:13:26.480
So, there you go.

05:13:30.480 --> 05:13:34.480
I drink a wee bit of cola, and then we're gonna get on my honey tea.

05:13:35.480 --> 05:13:37.480
Any honey tears?

05:13:37.480 --> 05:13:40.480
Me, me, I'm honey tea.

05:13:41.480 --> 05:13:46.480
And we can just be a peeler on them, and...

05:13:46.480 --> 05:13:48.480
Okay, they can't do anything.

05:13:48.480 --> 05:13:49.480
I cracked up.

05:13:49.480 --> 05:13:51.480
Wait, what was my joke?

05:13:53.480 --> 05:13:56.480
Wait, what joke did I just say? Hold on.

05:13:57.480 --> 05:14:00.480
Wait, what did I say? That was funny. Go again.

05:14:00.480 --> 05:14:03.480
Go again, tell me, remain me. I'm ready for going.

05:14:04.480 --> 05:14:09.480
Oh, the Maggie Thatcher.

05:14:09.480 --> 05:14:13.480
Alright, sorry, I thought it was a pun. I'm not gonna lie, I had my fingers ready to do that.

05:14:13.480 --> 05:14:15.480
Okay, my apologies.

05:14:15.480 --> 05:14:19.480
I thought I made a pun, and I was like, what did I make? That was funny.

05:14:19.480 --> 05:14:21.480
I forgot.

05:14:22.480 --> 05:14:23.480
Okay.

05:14:24.480 --> 05:14:29.480
Chewing fish and chips for my...

05:14:31.480 --> 05:14:33.480
I...

05:14:34.480 --> 05:14:38.480
So, do you want to hear the saddest story in all the land?

05:14:38.480 --> 05:14:41.480
I really like Mexican food.

05:14:41.480 --> 05:14:43.480
You know what I don't like?

05:14:43.480 --> 05:14:44.480
cilantro.

05:14:44.480 --> 05:14:46.480
And that stuff tastes awful.

05:14:46.480 --> 05:14:52.480
Do you want to know what cilantro is primarily used in?

05:14:53.480 --> 05:14:56.480
That's right, Mexican cooking.

05:14:57.480 --> 05:15:00.480
Man, I hated you.

05:15:01.480 --> 05:15:05.480
It tastes awful to me. Absolutely awful.

05:15:05.480 --> 05:15:07.480
I tried a...

05:15:07.480 --> 05:15:09.480
I tried a rice wrap.

05:15:09.480 --> 05:15:13.480
I think it was Vietnamese inspired rice wrap.

05:15:13.480 --> 05:15:17.480
No, rice cake wrap with chicken in it and all that.

05:15:17.480 --> 05:15:20.480
And it sounded so good and I took a bite and I was like...

05:15:21.480 --> 05:15:28.480
In Australia, there's a lot more access to Asian foods

05:15:28.480 --> 05:15:31.480
that are authentic or really good type thing,

05:15:31.480 --> 05:15:34.480
which is why I'm currently addicted to local Chinese.

05:15:38.480 --> 05:15:40.480
And so, I've been adventurous.

05:15:40.480 --> 05:15:42.480
I've been like, oh, I'll try this, I'll try that.

05:15:43.480 --> 05:15:48.480
And I couldn't figure out why I hated it until I finally figured out it's cilantro.

05:15:48.480 --> 05:15:51.480
I can't handle cilantro. It tastes nasty.

05:15:51.480 --> 05:15:53.480
I'm so sorry.

05:15:53.480 --> 05:15:58.480
I apologize to those who do enjoy cilantro.

05:15:58.480 --> 05:16:00.480
Yes, I have the soap gene.

05:16:00.480 --> 05:16:05.480
I cannot even describe to you how nasty and completely ruins

05:16:05.480 --> 05:16:09.480
and any trace of it in the food completely ruins the food as well.

05:16:09.480 --> 05:16:14.480
It is an unlucky and unfun gene to have.

05:16:14.480 --> 05:16:17.480
Isn't it genetic?

05:16:17.480 --> 05:16:19.480
I don't know if it's genetic.

05:16:19.480 --> 05:16:23.480
My dad, I think, eats it fine.

05:16:23.480 --> 05:16:28.480
Because one time he made, like, is it Pico de Mayo or something?

05:16:28.480 --> 05:16:31.480
I'm so sorry. I think I butchered that.

05:16:31.480 --> 05:16:34.480
He made it and I tasted it and I was like, this is nasty.

05:16:34.480 --> 05:16:35.480
But I never said that to him.

05:16:35.480 --> 05:16:38.480
I just said, oh, I don't think my taste buds agree with that,

05:16:38.480 --> 05:16:41.480
but he never said anything because of the cilantro in it.

05:16:41.480 --> 05:16:43.480
Pico de gallo.

05:16:43.480 --> 05:16:45.480
Okay, sorry.

05:16:46.480 --> 05:16:48.480
Pico de gallo.

05:16:48.480 --> 05:16:51.480
Yes, I think my dad tried to make some of it at home.

05:16:51.480 --> 05:16:55.480
And, yeah, I was like, hmm, nope.

05:17:01.480 --> 05:17:03.480
I better buckle up in Pico.

05:17:03.480 --> 05:17:05.480
No, buckle up in Pico.

05:17:05.480 --> 05:17:10.480
I've had my fair share of absolutely horrific things I've consumed.

05:17:12.480 --> 05:17:14.480
Where's the yellow thing?

05:17:14.480 --> 05:17:16.480
Oh, that reminds me of it.

05:17:16.480 --> 05:17:19.480
We need to do a watch along of Kevin Bridges.

05:17:22.480 --> 05:17:24.480
Kevin Bridges is a Scottish comedian.

05:17:24.480 --> 05:17:26.480
You might know someone called Frankie Boyle

05:17:26.480 --> 05:17:29.480
or what's the other Scottish comedian's name

05:17:29.480 --> 05:17:32.480
and I've forgotten his name and he's got Parkinson's right now,

05:17:32.480 --> 05:17:35.480
but he's still alive, I'm pretty sure.

05:17:36.480 --> 05:17:40.480
And he's got a beard and kind of big,

05:17:40.480 --> 05:17:43.480
not curly hair, but wavy hair.

05:17:43.480 --> 05:17:46.480
And he's older, oh my God, what's his name?

05:17:49.480 --> 05:17:51.480
Billy Conley, oh.

05:17:51.480 --> 05:17:53.480
Billy Conley.

05:17:53.480 --> 05:17:55.480
It took me so long to get there, holy crap.

05:17:55.480 --> 05:17:56.480
Billy Conley.

05:17:56.480 --> 05:17:59.480
Hold on, I need to drink my tea before I get sick.

05:18:05.480 --> 05:18:07.480
So I put far too much honey in my first team

05:18:07.480 --> 05:18:09.480
and I put far too much little.

05:18:09.480 --> 05:18:11.480
I can never find the balance.

05:18:11.480 --> 05:18:14.480
Billy Conley is like real Scots.

05:18:14.480 --> 05:18:17.480
I'm going to do watch alongs of like,

05:18:17.480 --> 05:18:19.480
Scottish comedy so you guys can laugh

05:18:19.480 --> 05:18:21.480
and I can be like,

05:18:21.480 --> 05:18:24.480
why are the reeflings running in an X pattern?

05:18:24.480 --> 05:18:27.480
So they are assigned each other to follow each other

05:18:27.480 --> 05:18:29.480
which is causing this four way.

05:18:29.480 --> 05:18:32.480
Oh my God, what are you doing over there?

05:18:35.480 --> 05:18:37.480
So they're not actually clicking anymore.

05:18:37.480 --> 05:18:39.480
Their characters are following each other

05:18:39.480 --> 05:18:41.480
which is causing an infinite loop.

05:18:41.480 --> 05:18:43.480
Which is pretty cool.

05:18:45.480 --> 05:18:48.480
Wait, you don't pronounce the second Billy Conley?

05:18:48.480 --> 05:18:50.480
Oh, Billy Conley, sorry.

05:18:50.480 --> 05:18:52.480
Billy Conley.

05:18:52.480 --> 05:18:54.480
I'm not good with names so don't expect any,

05:18:54.480 --> 05:18:57.480
don't expect a miracle with me, okay?

05:18:57.480 --> 05:18:59.480
It's a strong summoning ritual.

05:18:59.480 --> 05:19:02.480
Down with black rock.

05:19:05.480 --> 05:19:06.480
I love Kevin Bridges,

05:19:06.480 --> 05:19:08.480
my brother served him at a local club.

05:19:08.480 --> 05:19:10.480
Oh, that's amazing.

05:19:10.480 --> 05:19:13.480
I really enjoy Kevin Bridges' humour

05:19:13.480 --> 05:19:15.480
because it's quite deadpan.

05:19:15.480 --> 05:19:18.480
British humour is quite deadpan

05:19:18.480 --> 05:19:20.480
so we'll probably do a watch.

05:19:20.480 --> 05:19:22.480
Again, sturdy with it.

05:19:22.480 --> 05:19:26.480
Hold on, let me just get the fish out of the bank first.

05:19:26.480 --> 05:19:28.480
Reefing getting sturdy with it.

05:19:28.480 --> 05:19:34.480
Ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, hiddah hiddah hiddah hiddah hiddah hiddah hiddah.

05:19:34.480 --> 05:19:36.480
I love all these emotes in the game.

05:19:36.480 --> 05:19:40.480
I haven't unlocked any more but other than the default ones.

05:19:40.480 --> 05:19:42.480
Hmm.

05:19:42.480 --> 05:19:46.480
This stomped-on Rottra really sells me on the cult vibes.

05:19:46.480 --> 05:19:50.480
Aw, she be playing cult of the Lamb, did she finish it yet?

05:19:50.480 --> 05:19:53.480
I think she was so close to finishing it at last I knew

05:19:53.480 --> 05:19:56.480
but maybe she did it.

05:19:56.480 --> 05:19:58.480
Ehm

05:19:59.660 --> 05:20:01.660
Hydration

05:20:03.280 --> 05:20:08.260
Gears are quid, oh you're getting stabbed. It's a great one. It is. Oh my god and

05:20:09.560 --> 05:20:15.780
Oi fat boy right? I know this makes no I'm gonna. I'm gonna tell Kevin Bridges is joke, okay?

05:20:16.280 --> 05:20:22.220
So Kevin Bridges is a man, and he's quite large in size. I think he'd lost the weight since or whatever

05:20:22.220 --> 05:20:28.580
but he said he was like 25 stone or something which is big and he was telling

05:20:28.580 --> 05:20:34.100
the story where he's out late at night waiting on the bus and some net comes up

05:20:34.100 --> 05:20:40.340
and goes oh fat boy Gia's a quid or you're getting stabbed and then he's

05:20:40.340 --> 05:20:44.980
like I saw I start calculating my BMI with the other people around me type

05:20:44.980 --> 05:20:49.940
thing and then he ascertains that it's him that's been picked on by this

05:20:49.940 --> 05:20:58.900
person and he's like in order to avoid this heinous act against me for the

05:20:58.900 --> 05:21:04.900
mere price of a quid and I think that's a pretty good bargain and so he did not

05:21:04.900 --> 05:21:09.020
get stabbed that night that's the best I can do for telling the joke but it's a

05:21:09.020 --> 05:21:14.380
really good joke I'll get us to do a watch along Kevin Bridges call the

05:21:14.380 --> 05:21:17.780
lambs getting local co-op I know I'm gonna play it with sheebie and we'll force

05:21:17.780 --> 05:21:24.020
her to play with me and he used to weigh about 350 pounds

05:21:24.020 --> 05:21:31.380
there's an American place that lets you eat for free and if you're over like

05:21:31.380 --> 05:21:35.860
heart attack grill oh my god I'm so sorry I look at videos a heart attack grill

05:21:35.860 --> 05:21:42.780
I think it's so fascinating and there's like a way outside the restaurant and if

05:21:42.780 --> 05:21:50.020
you are over that weight you get to eat for free I'm like wow 25 stone equal to

05:21:50.020 --> 05:21:58.660

premature there wow we are like burning through this well I don't know what

05:22:06.540 --> 05:22:14.580
level I can cook those octopuses but I think we'll go to the grand exchange and

05:22:14.580 --> 05:22:22.980
buy some I have a terrible feeling they are a membership only item so we might

05:22:22.980 --> 05:22:26.260
have to swap to a membership world which is a shame for anyone who's not a

05:22:26.260 --> 05:22:30.020
member the heart attack griffin

05:22:30.020 --> 05:22:37.300
mm isn't heart attack girl just a place because the owner hates fat people and

05:22:37.300 --> 05:22:43.520
wants them to do what is that the lore or

05:22:43.520 --> 05:22:50.420

eating that's what I'm saying when a stream I don't feel like eating properly

05:23:23.060 --> 05:23:30.140

herds came from Scotland Ireland has a higher redhead percentage I believe but

05:24:14.900 --> 05:24:22.780
you must acknowledge with that that due to the Irish potato famine which was

05:24:22.780 --> 05:24:28.500
actually just a British government and starving the people and a lot of Irish

05:24:28.500 --> 05:24:34.460

let's make more girls gingers together and then do it like this okay that worked

05:26:54.300 --> 05:27:00.060
make sure you do it every 14 seconds to he a huge XP job put 14 in the bank and

05:27:00.060 --> 05:27:09.980
then combine them about chat it gives about 2200 average huh so this is more

05:27:09.980 --> 05:27:17.140
or less than cooking the swordies we're gonna go for about 14 second random

05:27:17.140 --> 05:27:24.020
timer they take a bit to ferment okay I'll ferment you I'll ferment you in a

05:27:24.020 --> 05:27:28.980
minute in between these cheeks sorry breeding more changers into the world

05:27:28.980 --> 05:27:41.060
of strong you can also right click the X button oh no they're gonna ferment

05:27:41.060 --> 05:27:45.140
before I'm ready don't ferment don't ferment I'm getting scared can't throw

05:27:45.140 --> 05:27:48.220
at me really good time they only ferment when you aren't crafting wine

05:27:48.220 --> 05:27:55.580
how bizarre okay I guess can you get bad wine or is wine always successful you

05:27:55.580 --> 05:27:59.700
can use the X button on the bottom of your bank tab so you can bank all isn't

05:27:59.700 --> 05:28:05.820
enough faster if I like pull out wine put wine away pull out water pull it

05:28:05.820 --> 05:28:12.660
great you can make bad wine did a burnt fish people buy bad wine then click

05:28:12.660 --> 05:28:21.980
twice as fast is it painful watching someone trying to maximize their like

05:28:21.980 --> 05:28:25.700
XP gain and they're doing it all wrong you're just like oh god I can't watch

05:28:25.700 --> 05:28:36.100
this anymore that's what two clicks now it's fun to watch you can't get bad

05:28:36.100 --> 05:28:41.060
what wine because you're such high level so you pull it 14 each and come back

05:28:41.060 --> 05:28:44.180
all after

05:28:54.780 --> 05:29:05.300
ah was that right did I do it right the sentence 14 yeah I think I did it right

05:29:05.300 --> 05:29:12.900
okay we did it we got there in the end only non-alcoholic wine is bad oh well

05:29:12.900 --> 05:29:17.300
apparently I like all the reports are now coming out about how bad alcohol is

05:31:45.820 --> 05:31:51.780
god I'm going to take a minute to learn these strats and and he basically came

05:31:51.780 --> 05:31:56.660

05:32:44.180 --> 05:32:53.900
whole lot of trauma yeah like and so Ed mind was like too bad seven 750 trout

05:32:53.900 --> 05:33:00.020

05:33:00.020 --> 05:33:04.740
we're getting there we're getting there we're getting after repentance I feel

05:33:04.780 --> 05:33:08.540
like well there's been a bit of whispers about the binding of Isaac

05:33:08.540 --> 05:33:14.580
because someone did a cheeky day of mine when they shouldn't have and there is

05:33:14.580 --> 05:33:20.940
something called the repentance plus it is possible empty sack click click

05:33:20.940 --> 05:33:26.380
combine yes I might need to do that escape thing honestly not my work

05:33:26.540 --> 05:33:40.300
you can set buttons to escape in space honestly yeah so it's possible there

05:33:40.300 --> 05:33:46.500
might be an item update I am not part sorry and hold on hold on I can't talk

05:33:46.500 --> 05:33:49.420
into that at the same time it's possible that they're gonna have a slight

05:33:49.420 --> 05:33:56.140
change to some items and all that jazz the DLC does come out in November which

05:33:56.180 --> 05:33:59.700
means we can all play multiplayer together and I'm going to go crazy

05:33:59.700 --> 05:34:07.980
you literally you're gonna be sick of it but I think it would be really empty

05:34:07.980 --> 05:34:14.940
sack it would be really good to get dead God together I think that would be

05:34:14.940 --> 05:34:18.900
crazy because I would make it so much easier of all through like the max

05:34:18.900 --> 05:34:24.780
lobby size is four so three reeflings at a time can do a run with me and I'll

05:34:24.820 --> 05:34:27.780
just do it the way we did with Elden Ring where I write down your name and

05:34:27.780 --> 05:34:33.860
who got in and you know take it from there type thing oh my god right empty sack

05:34:33.860 --> 05:34:41.180

05:34:41.180 --> 05:34:47.060
thing I need to do now dead God would feel so close literally I could do it with

05:34:47.060 --> 05:34:53.460
it I could definitely do it with co-op help but do you follow matters or grab

05:34:53.500 --> 05:35:00.020
items oh no I just do whatever I want I have never actually it took me so long

05:35:00.020 --> 05:35:06.940

supposed to do space one up do you plan on making an old-school runescape up no

05:38:23.780 --> 05:38:27.820
I don't know what planning is I've never done it or been in one before I just

05:38:27.820 --> 05:38:31.940
used to be the scammer at the exchange post I was like double in money that's

05:38:31.940 --> 05:38:38.700
me that's what I did I can't believe it I can't believe it

05:38:38.700 --> 05:38:41.900
wait combine oh I never had escape that time

05:38:41.940 --> 05:38:52.020
whoa whoa wait what did Stroni cause a spike apparently the price of trout is

05:38:52.020 --> 05:38:58.300
going really weird right now Stroni took all my money I'm sorry I took your

05:38:58.300 --> 05:39:02.220
thousand gold I sure you did absolutely nothing with it because I abandoned

05:39:02.220 --> 05:39:15.300
they can't probably never bothered again price trout trout is 41 raw trout

05:39:15.300 --> 05:39:25.020
190 for a raw trout quick sailing for like 189 hmm did we actually one goes

05:39:25.020 --> 05:39:32.540

please don't look please don't look I'm embarrassed I'm I don't know what we're

05:39:56.800 --> 05:40:03.120
gonna end on if we do I think someone said it was like five endurance streams

05:40:03.120 --> 05:40:12.480

05:40:16.840 --> 05:40:23.720
don't form in don't firm in you see honestly it's less about being efficient

05:40:23.720 --> 05:40:30.040
and more about saving our hands so you guys don't have to stoke the fire for me

05:40:30.040 --> 05:40:32.480
all the time

05:40:33.200 --> 05:40:35.720

just keep doing it until they're all gone I don't know how long it takes to do

05:40:58.520 --> 05:41:04.840
6,000 wines though I could only do 14 pair inventory slot which is a bit of a

05:41:04.840 --> 05:41:15.120
problem so I need like just what 14 how many 14's does it take to get to 100 I

05:41:15.120 --> 05:41:24.800
don't know but I'm gonna be here for a while I think or is it six no 14 my

05:42:05.600 --> 05:42:10.920
seven inventories to do a hundred that's quite a lot

05:42:11.600 --> 05:42:23.560

05:42:23.560 --> 05:42:30.480
wines to get from 68 to 99 brah who picked this is there not right let's do

05:42:30.480 --> 05:42:36.560
fletching we can do fletching in four hours we're getting how many wines there's

05:42:36.560 --> 05:42:42.680

05:42:42.680 --> 05:42:50.440
I messed up have I messed up picking this game it's 200 XP per wine oh that's

05:42:50.440 --> 05:42:56.920
more than the fish fletching is death gonna messed up your room have I made a

05:42:56.920 --> 05:43:02.640
mistake picking King I'm getting nervous I'm getting chicken and now I did say the

05:43:02.640 --> 05:43:07.880
next time we do runescape I'm going we're gonna what do a movie watch along

05:43:07.880 --> 05:43:17.520
as well just so I can rest my voice unless you do like how's the cooking

05:43:17.520 --> 05:43:21.960
going we're starting to feel a bit daunted now and it's starting to settle

05:43:21.960 --> 05:43:30.000
in like oh no this is a lot and the next time we do runescape stream we are

05:43:30.040 --> 05:43:33.360
gonna be watching a movie series so I don't have to talk and I can rest my

05:43:33.360 --> 05:43:36.560
voice a little bit because I do have quite a few ASMR clubs coming up and I

05:43:36.560 --> 05:43:43.120
need to keep my voice steady need my voice to be steady and ready wines are

05:43:43.120 --> 05:43:56.440
like 480k if you're consistent per hour I mean it's alright you need 87k sword

05:43:56.480 --> 05:44:07.000
fish so waitings are still faster in the end oh my gosh oh we flins I think I'm

05:44:07.000 --> 05:44:12.200
gonna messed up picking cooking but I really want 99 I've never had my first

05:44:12.200 --> 05:44:20.520
99 before I'm getting nervous I'm gonna shake you just drink back what's with a

05:44:20.520 --> 05:44:24.000
ritual dance at the top of the screen those are reeflings they're just dancing

05:44:24.000 --> 05:44:30.440
each other we're all hanging out of the fire remember level 92 is halfway stop

05:44:30.440 --> 05:44:44.520
is it actually no I will not give myself that I'll see what happens after the

05:44:44.520 --> 05:44:53.120
movie marathon xp wise it's halfway I know what happened to the legendary

05:44:53.120 --> 05:44:58.680
stamina I'm getting nervous I don't know if I have an end in stamina now I'm

05:44:58.680 --> 05:45:03.480
getting shaking way right empty boom boom

05:45:03.480 --> 05:45:10.000
boy fat boom boom cooking is the fastest without completely rune like cooking

05:45:10.000 --> 05:45:19.160
fish isn't it good that we'll be there with it yeah next runescape stream though

05:45:19.160 --> 05:45:23.840
I'm gonna be watching movies so I'm not talking too much because my voice is

05:45:23.840 --> 05:45:30.880
getting shredded but I love it can't help can't stop talking okay

05:45:31.440 --> 05:45:39.160
well making wines is faster with the reeflings here 99 shouldn't be a problem

05:45:39.160 --> 05:45:48.480
okay okay okay although it'd be really cool to look back and see how much time

05:45:48.480 --> 05:45:55.200
I spent I wouldn't mind doing some questing after we get 99 cooking I don't

05:45:55.200 --> 05:46:00.480
know if I'm gonna be able to do 99 cooking in one month though because of

05:46:00.480 --> 05:46:05.200
the streams that I've got planned out it doesn't really work that well because of

05:46:05.200 --> 05:46:14.760
Elden Ring because of Elden Ring I would have been able to put more time into

05:46:14.760 --> 05:46:20.160
Rinscape but because of Elden Ring 99 cooking that's all because of a mediocre

05:46:20.160 --> 05:46:26.920
joke that you're a whammin you got this Johnny we'll make you and we'll get

05:46:26.920 --> 05:46:34.720
your master chef but it would be kind of cool to look back at like this the

05:46:34.720 --> 05:46:40.480
stream thumbnails and see how much time it took obviously we did some questing

05:46:40.480 --> 05:46:43.840
the first I had so much fun like doing all those quests and like waiting for

05:46:43.840 --> 05:46:48.800
everyone and be like okay we'll do this next we'll do this night and so if I do

05:46:48.800 --> 05:46:54.680
achieve 99 cooking and I'm not burnt out of RuneScape then pardon me I'm burping

05:46:54.680 --> 05:47:03.240
away here I actually wouldn't mind and I wouldn't mind what I wouldn't mind doing

05:47:03.240 --> 05:47:06.080
some more quests than again together because that's quite fun and it's more

05:47:06.080 --> 05:47:12.760
interactive than literally you do need to do a quest to cook a koambas I can

05:47:12.760 --> 05:47:17.480
never say I don't know what on earth I'm supposed to pronounce them as and are

05:47:17.480 --> 05:47:26.640
they better XP than wine is the question that need combat for that quest by

05:47:26.640 --> 05:47:37.600
any chance 50 subs away from 60 stop is that video still getting traction yeah

05:47:38.600 --> 05:47:50.600
sticking at my yet for the river only by tick manipulating right no if wait so

05:47:50.600 --> 05:47:58.560
I'm just doing wines for the rest of this entire gig oh no it's only faster if

05:47:58.560 --> 05:48:04.120
you're paying attention I'm just doing wings for the rest oh this is terrible

05:48:04.120 --> 05:48:11.080
stream content you guys just seem to go back and forth to make more wines wait

05:48:11.080 --> 05:48:16.800
so then why was that chick doing lobsters we're the one with a big jibblies out

05:48:16.800 --> 05:48:22.480
why did she do lobsters for cooking is lobsters cheaper cheaper can always

05:48:22.480 --> 05:48:27.880
switch it up yeah I'll maybe finish my swordfish once this batch for minutes

05:48:27.880 --> 05:48:32.600
I'll swap back to the swordfish just so like everything the reflins gave me and

level 72 right I'll take it level 72 that's actually not that bad though I'm

05:55:19.260 --> 05:55:21.860
quite happy about

05:55:22.540 --> 05:55:36.220
198 key 198 key seriously whoops that was good though that was really good okay

05:55:36.220 --> 05:55:43.980
maybe wines is the way to go because a big if true and I'm not even finished

05:55:43.980 --> 05:55:47.820
fermenting all the wine that I've got hold on I'm gonna put the heating on

05:55:47.820 --> 05:56:03.780
cuz I'm absolutely frozen it's 15 degrees am I supposed to survive in

05:56:04.780 --> 05:56:20.600
yeah apparently I'm Australian I rent and but okay I just I just popped the

05:56:20.600 --> 05:56:24.880
last into the 73 I would have jumped three levels if I managed to do one more

05:56:24.880 --> 05:56:30.300
batch right hold on let's see what's going on with my Azure delay she is coming

05:56:30.300 --> 05:56:39.820
up oh my god as it were please spell correctly there she is there she is oh

05:56:39.820 --> 05:56:45.540
literally in T-minus two minutes and Azura is playing a absolutely precious

05:56:45.540 --> 05:56:51.660
game called stray I have not yet had the pleasure to play it but it's bloody

05:56:51.660 --> 05:57:00.500
good yeah yeah if you've made the 1,000 winds it would have been a two hundred

05:57:00.500 --> 05:57:04.860
keep on listen to strong you yeah well at work and proof product to me I feel

05:57:04.860 --> 05:57:17.020
like and I feel like I would distract being like at work and stuff honestly

05:57:17.900 --> 05:57:22.860
if I had an office I feel like I'd be like one of them bosses that couldn't

05:57:22.860 --> 05:57:28.100
just give a rat's ass like as long as you do the work go home early doesn't

05:57:28.100 --> 05:57:34.180
bother me none seems like whenever someone gets a manager type job they

05:57:34.180 --> 05:57:37.580
think they call the shots and it was like no you're at the mercy of your

05:57:37.580 --> 05:57:44.900
workers let's let's not get it twisted let's not get it twisted are you doing

05:57:44.940 --> 05:57:49.260
marshmallow later yeah of course I'll do marshmallow more than happy to I would

05:57:49.260 --> 05:57:53.740
I'll do it when we do when we go back to the fish because unfortunately the

05:57:53.740 --> 05:58:02.700
winds require a lot more and like fast clicking every time I move to the left

05:58:02.700 --> 05:58:10.780
I need to do and I'm getting nervous now not to be a minger but when I tried to

05:58:10.780 --> 05:58:15.540
go to toilet but nothing came out and I'm worried I'm gonna have to go toilet

05:58:15.540 --> 05:58:22.300
in the middle of the stream but I don't want to go toilet I normally take a

05:58:22.300 --> 05:58:34.500
shower after I fell off my most thought what time come in here oops I will do

05:58:34.500 --> 05:58:40.220
marshmallow it's not problem use your gamer bucket please do not ever type

05:58:40.220 --> 05:58:48.420
again gamer bucket now pee bottles I can tolerate gamer bucket like Eric

05:58:48.420 --> 05:58:57.700
Cartman style ma'am ma'am I need to use the bathroom ma'am you gotta go for a

05:58:57.700 --> 05:59:04.180
job eh the birthday girl my team leader in quality assurance didn't sell their

05:59:04.180 --> 05:59:08.180
their premiums since months because the workers are more made and didn't get

05:59:08.180 --> 05:59:14.780
trained properly literally just because you in the manager position does not

05:59:14.780 --> 05:59:17.820
make you a leader

05:59:17.820 --> 05:59:34.340
magi playing runescape into 24 without a refunds you know the gamer bucket

05:59:34.340 --> 05:59:44.780
yes yes on a scale of 1 to 10 how jealous are you of men's ability to use

05:59:44.780 --> 05:59:56.900
gamer ball I I don't think it applies to me because I have acidic like main

05:59:56.900 --> 06:00:03.980
stinks actually I probably should have mentioned that to the doctor he forgot to

06:00:03.980 --> 06:00:07.740
mention it what was that also if you try to do a last night name fletching your

06:00:07.740 --> 06:00:12.020
wrist would die after a few minutes unless you learned mostly I don't have

06:00:12.020 --> 06:00:19.980
that kind of mouse I have up and down on the mouse that's it good dinner ruined

06:00:19.980 --> 06:00:29.980
sorry okay I think we're gonna have to swap back to the sort the swordfish just

06:00:29.980 --> 06:00:35.980
for a little bit because this is like one after the other your mace your face

06:00:35.980 --> 06:00:48.700
melts off kind of acid yeah mouse keys are button presses oh I don't have that

06:00:49.140 --> 06:00:53.620
that's it how about we just bought the levels and I'll just commentate over oh

06:00:53.620 --> 06:00:59.680
my god you leveled up congrats I'm kidding by the way we're not born I don't

06:00:59.680 --> 06:01:03.420
know how bad the box are in runescape I heard they're really bad in World of

06:01:03.420 --> 06:01:15.260
Warcraft but bots apparently keep prices low and cheeky runescape so gamer girl

06:01:15.260 --> 06:01:21.260
uses P-Bollies more long I'm already in trouble by YouTube actually should check

06:01:21.260 --> 06:01:27.780
out wait no I'll check it when we're doing the fish not well this is being in

06:01:27.780 --> 06:01:47.220
the way I will check it after I've done this batch of wines which I just know

06:01:47.220 --> 06:01:50.340
some people say like oh the reason why the box are actually good is because they

06:01:50.340 --> 06:01:54.540
keep everything low price because they're like trying to fight over the same

06:01:54.580 --> 06:02:00.380
resources type thing and I was like honestly that is actually valid

06:02:00.380 --> 06:02:05.340
feedback right we'll go down to five thousand water and then I'm gonna swap

06:02:05.340 --> 06:02:11.780
to fish just to like use up all the fish because it's just and and I'll read

06:02:11.780 --> 06:02:24.060
some marshmallow Q&A's if you want to say something say something sorry I know

06:02:24.060 --> 06:02:29.460
I'm not doing that the good way but they there are bots that kill some of the

06:02:29.460 --> 06:02:37.620
hardest bosses in the game in the tens of thousands yeah but keep runescape

06:02:37.620 --> 06:02:46.260
economy from hyper inflating mmm can't believe it capitalism wins again even in

06:02:46.260 --> 06:02:53.620
my video games and I can't escape didn't they just catch some box and wow by

06:02:53.660 --> 06:02:59.500
placing a single rope oh wait I seem to remember something like that I think

06:02:59.500 --> 06:03:05.140
you're right also just gold farmers who are boss they just sell the money later

06:03:05.140 --> 06:03:12.700
on oh yeah you can like buy like in-game currency with like actual money so like

06:03:12.700 --> 06:03:19.220
you get given the money or something because of the there's like a Venezuelan

06:03:19.220 --> 06:03:28.100
meme so the Venezuelan Venezuelan economy went to shambles and and

06:03:28.100 --> 06:03:38.180
basically it became profitable for those individuals to play runescape and sell

06:03:38.180 --> 06:03:42.780
the in-game currency or something yeah my brains like can remember that they sell

06:03:42.780 --> 06:03:52.220
on a third-party set for anyone which is against us oh okay okay okay I get I

06:03:52.220 --> 06:03:57.780
guess it's against us on World of Warcraft as well that could be wrong I

06:03:57.780 --> 06:04:05.220
don't know Azura has gone live okay if there's any bleeding hearts or any

06:04:05.220 --> 06:04:10.900
reeflings who are needing a break from the winemaking Azura Dooley has gone

06:05:04.020 --> 06:05:07.020

06:12:14.540 --> 06:12:20.940
I've had people explain it to me I've never had it in my entire life they say it's when

06:12:21.900 --> 06:12:28.060
your body is still asleep but you wake up and your mind but because you're in a certain phase of

06:12:28.380 --> 06:12:33.420
sleep things become really scary um and like you realize that you're paralyzed and so

06:12:36.620 --> 06:12:45.260
um so it's rather oh I shouldn't have put the heating on I'm yawning again

being aquatic creatures do we reef flings when you need to be moisturized asking for a really

06:14:26.380 --> 06:14:31.100
important time to pick a question I don't know I feel like we just kind of like hydrate instantly

06:14:31.100 --> 06:14:35.260
when we enter the water again like we're fine to be out of the water but it's just where we are

06:14:37.580 --> 06:14:38.300
the incoming

06:14:42.540 --> 06:14:48.540

uh hold on I need to read this one um hi strongy a few things I wanted to say and ask

06:15:51.500 --> 06:15:56.540
most of the questions are for later than the line so feel free to disregard them if you need to be

06:15:58.540 --> 06:16:04.940
first I wanted to say you and other girls really helped keep me sane last week it was tough but

06:16:04.940 --> 06:16:09.420

you wiefling um would you ever consider opening a PO box I am so sorry however um I've discouraged

06:16:21.100 --> 06:16:31.340
all girls uh from a PO box opening due to the fact that um air trackers are I think no I'm not

06:16:31.340 --> 06:16:36.780
accusing you of putting an air tracker in it or anything like that uh the safety reasons just

06:16:36.780 --> 06:16:44.780
completely outweigh the fun that could be in a PO box I do apologize what is a box a PO box is

06:16:44.780 --> 06:16:51.340
like a setup location where you can send packages and and I would go retrieve them but for safety

06:16:51.340 --> 06:16:57.260
reasons I can't have any of that so I am so sorry but thank you for being interested in sending this

06:16:57.260 --> 06:17:03.580

06:19:56.380 --> 06:20:03.900
able to breathe darling I think you'd I think you'd need to tap out so I can you know stand up and

06:20:03.900 --> 06:20:11.660
not suffocate you all right we'll do it in the ASMR booth how about that convention premium

get a special prize or something sacrifices mumma

06:20:33.340 --> 06:20:37.340
hey stroney you said gen 2 is cooking does that mean we don't have a chance and there won't be

06:20:37.340 --> 06:20:46.940
additions oh no sorry uh no when I say gen 2 is cooking it took a year for concept art model

06:20:47.740 --> 06:20:55.340
assets emotes all of that it takes a year to do that kind of stuff we're at the stage of going

06:20:55.340 --> 06:21:02.140
all the way back to the start all the way back to one paragraph about this girl all the way back to

06:21:02.140 --> 06:21:08.220
write what are the names all the way back like we're all the way back there so please don't there's no

06:21:08.220 --> 06:21:19.900
one um I said in the exposing viewer stream no one got a call back um there is no call back

06:21:20.860 --> 06:21:31.420
there is no me um take off your clothes gen 2 fan here no it is um we're all the way back thankfully

06:21:31.420 --> 06:21:40.060
I am not on the heavier side of um development when it comes to names or whatever but it's like

06:21:40.060 --> 06:21:46.220
we're now going all the way back um especially like the lower art I need to think of the story

06:21:49.580 --> 06:21:54.940
but that's what I mean when I say we're all the way back to gen 2 um

06:21:55.740 --> 06:21:56.380
um

06:21:58.140 --> 06:22:02.460
or did you just mean characters then models and niches and such yes that's what I meant sorry

06:22:02.460 --> 06:22:11.580
to scare you no I will it'll be the exact same pro there's no date there's no date I'm which I'm

06:22:11.580 --> 06:22:17.020
so freaking glad there's no date because making a deadline is horrible and I don't ever want to have

06:22:17.020 --> 06:22:24.380
a deadline like that again um the announcements for that kind of stuff only will come out when

06:22:24.380 --> 06:22:33.580
things are ready and as I said the generation one will be up for a year before gen 2 even like

06:22:34.940 --> 06:22:40.460
yeah it'll be at least a year like after do you know I mean I don't know if that makes sense

06:22:40.460 --> 06:22:45.820
good night I'ma turn in please rest well sorry I must have too busy rambling sleep well those of

06:22:45.820 --> 06:22:54.300
you who need to sleep um but yes uh it's it took a year for development it is not quick it's not

06:22:54.300 --> 06:22:58.940
easy it's not fast um and especially when you've got artists that love to go over deadlines um

06:23:01.580 --> 06:23:07.260
it makes everything an absolute nightmare um I kind of said a wee bit of it on the

06:23:07.260 --> 06:23:14.860
Assassin's Creed Brotherhood stream I had planned everything to occur within certain months

06:23:15.660 --> 06:23:22.860
and then everything went to because artists all unanimously went over deadlines so if you're an

06:23:22.860 --> 06:23:29.020
artist that works with us look I'm not mad at you everyone did it so you know you know it's fine

06:23:29.740 --> 06:23:40.140
but uh everyone went over and it made everything happen in May when May was supposed to be

06:23:40.140 --> 06:23:45.020
where I fully focused on getting stuff done for the girls and like we're still kind of

06:23:45.020 --> 06:23:50.060
picking up the pieces like I'm doing stuff I shouldn't really have shouldn't be doing at the stage

06:23:50.060 --> 06:23:55.980
like it was supposed to be handed off or there's supposed to be something else in place um but it

06:23:55.980 --> 06:24:04.140
just a nightmare nightmare nightmare how many marshmallows do you have 850 on the dot actually

06:24:04.140 --> 06:24:18.140
850 um yes I don't even know how I got on that rant hey well I still have two ideas for a gen two

06:24:18.140 --> 06:24:23.980
what would you want to tell us which one two things that I think would be popular a lollipop dragon

06:24:24.060 --> 06:24:31.100
there's no lollipop dragon feature bros curious to get to do it after the pandora on anything

06:24:31.980 --> 06:24:39.580
also I think an insect girl in the style of a traditional Japanese geisha who uses her own

06:24:39.580 --> 06:24:44.540
self to make her clothes would be popular that's unique I've not heard that not a bad idea

06:24:49.180 --> 06:24:59.580
uh I think I need a job I think I need a mute and go hold on it makes me still mix going

06:25:01.580 --> 06:25:07.340
hold on a minute refund uh I've a hydrate and then I'm gonna go for a few minutes

06:31:04.180 --> 06:31:06.180
When whamming ovulate

06:31:06.180 --> 06:31:09.180
You get a clear ink that comes out of you

06:31:09.180 --> 06:31:11.180
Produced naturally

06:31:11.180 --> 06:31:13.180
And I just had that and I was like what?

06:31:13.180 --> 06:31:15.180

06:31:38.180 --> 06:31:40.180
I have over 2,000 burnt pork, bitch

06:31:40.180 --> 06:31:42.180
That's so cool

06:31:42.180 --> 06:31:44.180
Good to know

06:31:44.180 --> 06:31:46.180
I made my new one

06:31:46.180 --> 06:31:48.180
Bro I wish I could have shown you that

06:31:48.180 --> 06:31:50.180
Honestly I was like what on earth

06:31:55.180 --> 06:31:56.180
Yes

06:31:56.180 --> 06:31:57.180
I

06:31:59.180 --> 06:32:00.180
I I I

06:32:00.180 --> 06:32:02.180
I don't know what's happening with my butt

06:32:04.180 --> 06:32:06.180
I need to go number 2

06:32:06.180 --> 06:32:08.180
But nothing's happening

06:32:10.180 --> 06:32:12.180
You like receiving bibbutes?

06:32:12.180 --> 06:32:13.180
Go

06:32:13.180 --> 06:32:15.180
Go

06:32:16.180 --> 06:32:19.180
I am down atrocious I volunteer

06:32:19.180 --> 06:32:21.180
Hey guys you wanna make gen 2 right now?

06:32:21.180 --> 06:32:23.180
I'm ovulating

06:32:23.180 --> 06:32:25.180
Oh my god we can just say that

06:32:25.180 --> 06:32:27.180
Every time I'm ovulating I'll be like gen 2

06:32:27.180 --> 06:32:29.180
Come on

06:32:30.180 --> 06:32:32.180
I was a dino chicken

06:32:34.180 --> 06:32:37.180
Humans are just monkeys with fanfare shoes though

06:32:37.180 --> 06:32:39.180
Oh thoughts

06:32:39.180 --> 06:32:41.180
Not quite close enough

06:32:41.180 --> 06:32:44.180
But a few more evolutionary factors in there

06:32:44.180 --> 06:32:47.180
Multiple reefling

06:32:47.180 --> 06:32:49.180
Producers, feature, activity

06:32:49.180 --> 06:32:52.180
Sorry I'm starting

06:32:54.180 --> 06:32:57.180
Well we have over 200 volunteers

06:32:57.180 --> 06:32:59.180
I volunteer

06:33:00.180 --> 06:33:02.180
We did it we're in the

06:33:02.180 --> 06:33:04.180
We're in a million XP

06:33:04.180 --> 06:33:06.180
God wines are so fast

06:33:06.180 --> 06:33:07.180
We were

06:33:07.180 --> 06:33:09.180
I don't even think we were like

06:33:09.180 --> 06:33:11.180
I don't even know what we were at the start of the stream

06:33:11.180 --> 06:33:13.180
But we're already a million XP

06:33:13.180 --> 06:33:15.180
That's fantastic

06:33:16.180 --> 06:33:18.180
Seriously we're making

06:33:18.180 --> 06:33:20.180
I think the wines really is the vehicle

06:33:23.180 --> 06:33:25.180
Aw someone said thank you for existing

06:33:25.180 --> 06:33:27.180
You're so awesome reefling

06:33:27.180 --> 06:33:29.180
Thank you for existing

06:33:39.180 --> 06:33:41.180
Aw

06:33:41.180 --> 06:33:43.180
I don't know

06:33:43.180 --> 06:33:46.180
Someone is currently anonymously editing for the girls

06:33:46.180 --> 06:33:48.180
But they don't want any credit

06:33:48.180 --> 06:33:50.180
But we are gonna upload the videos

06:33:50.180 --> 06:33:52.180
You don't need to apologize for not subtitling it

06:33:52.180 --> 06:33:54.180
Subtitling don't take long on

06:33:54.180 --> 06:33:56.180
The videos are like 3 minutes long

06:33:57.180 --> 06:33:59.180
So

06:33:59.180 --> 06:34:02.180
Are the gen 1 models quintuplets

06:34:03.180 --> 06:34:05.180
I like to joke

06:34:05.180 --> 06:34:07.180
That I had the girls in my stomach

06:34:07.180 --> 06:34:09.180
For like how long

06:34:09.180 --> 06:34:10.180
12 months

06:34:10.180 --> 06:34:12.180
Yeah I guess 12 months on the dot

06:34:14.180 --> 06:34:16.180
Nearly there 598

06:34:16.180 --> 06:34:18.180
Oh my god I owe you guys so much

06:34:18.180 --> 06:34:20.180
There's some more videos I'm not even uploading the first one

06:34:23.180 --> 06:34:26.180
I think I'm gonna be too tired after stream though

06:34:26.180 --> 06:34:29.180
To edit and upload the

06:34:29.180 --> 06:34:31.180
First one

06:34:33.180 --> 06:34:36.180
Oh my god problems are being an overachiever

06:34:36.180 --> 06:34:38.180
For now

06:34:39.180 --> 06:34:42.180
Have you ever played Metal Gear Solid?

06:34:42.180 --> 06:34:44.180
I don't think I've played it

06:34:44.180 --> 06:34:46.180
But I've definitely heard of it

06:34:46.180 --> 06:34:48.180
Game suggestion

06:34:48.180 --> 06:34:50.180
Mad Rat Dead

06:34:50.180 --> 06:34:52.180
It's a rhythm platform game on Nintendo

06:34:52.180 --> 06:34:54.180
How odd

06:34:54.180 --> 06:34:55.180
Creaks

06:34:55.180 --> 06:34:57.180
It's a puzzle game with a rare art style

06:34:57.180 --> 06:34:59.180
The storyline is decent and you can use it

06:34:59.180 --> 06:35:01.180
To interact with chat if you get sucked

06:35:01.180 --> 06:35:04.180
I do it like when chat holds my hand through game

06:35:04.180 --> 06:35:07.180
How'd you mention SteelSeries during the collab

06:35:07.180 --> 06:35:09.180
Hopefully it works well for you

06:35:09.180 --> 06:35:12.180
No whenever Azura talks to me

06:35:12.180 --> 06:35:15.180
I don't know if the other girls can hear Azura

06:35:15.180 --> 06:35:18.180
Whenever Azura talks to me via discord

06:35:18.180 --> 06:35:21.180
Her make always cuts out and can't handle her

06:35:21.180 --> 06:35:24.180
And I'm like Azura get that noise gate off

06:35:24.180 --> 06:35:26.180
And she's like I've not got anything on

06:35:26.180 --> 06:35:28.180
And I'm like what is?

06:35:28.180 --> 06:35:30.180
Cause I can never hear her

06:35:30.180 --> 06:35:32.180
I think the other girls can hear her

06:35:34.180 --> 06:35:37.180
But I can never hear her when we have a collab

06:35:37.180 --> 06:35:39.180
On discord or anything

06:35:39.180 --> 06:35:42.180
And when she gets excited it cuts into her even more

06:35:42.180 --> 06:35:45.180
But I don't know if she has discord fillers on maybe

06:35:46.180 --> 06:35:49.180
Which is why I'm like ah Azura are you in that SteelSeries

06:35:49.180 --> 06:35:51.180
Cause I've said to her a few times now

06:35:51.180 --> 06:35:52.180
I'm not annoyed or anything

06:35:52.180 --> 06:35:55.180
It's more like a meme where I'm like ah SteelSeries

06:35:57.180 --> 06:35:59.180
Someone has sent me a cat box

06:35:59.180 --> 06:36:00.180
Should it open up?

06:36:00.180 --> 06:36:02.180
Fuck it I'm feeling risky

06:36:02.180 --> 06:36:03.180
What is it?

06:36:03.180 --> 06:36:04.180
It's a picture

06:36:04.180 --> 06:36:05.180
Whoa!

06:36:05.180 --> 06:36:06.180
Okay!

06:36:06.180 --> 06:36:07.180
Yep

06:36:07.180 --> 06:36:09.180
That's the picture alright

06:36:12.180 --> 06:36:16.180
Okay I'm not gonna open up any cat box

06:36:17.180 --> 06:36:18.180
Links

06:36:19.180 --> 06:36:20.180
Well I'm true

06:36:25.180 --> 06:36:26.180
Okay

06:36:26.180 --> 06:36:28.180
Okay swordfish

06:36:28.180 --> 06:36:29.180
Swordfish yes

06:36:34.180 --> 06:36:36.180
Share it with a class male

06:36:38.180 --> 06:36:39.180
Hi

06:36:39.180 --> 06:36:42.180
Would you be okay with me using this whole smegment?

06:36:42.180 --> 06:36:44.180
Smegment? Oh my god

06:36:44.180 --> 06:36:45.180
I've got cocks on my mind

06:36:45.180 --> 06:36:46.180
What the fuck

06:36:46.180 --> 06:36:50.180
So small segment of the clapping audio for a meme

06:36:50.180 --> 06:36:51.180
Yeah sure

06:36:51.180 --> 06:36:52.180
If so would you rather wait now

06:36:52.180 --> 06:36:54.180
Now you can post it it's fine honestly

06:36:54.180 --> 06:36:57.180
It's cause it's gonna be publicly posted

06:36:57.180 --> 06:37:00.180
It's not really an issue to make any of the content a meme

06:37:00.180 --> 06:37:01.180
I'm so sorry

06:37:01.180 --> 06:37:02.180
Ah frickin

06:37:02.180 --> 06:37:03.180
That was

06:37:03.180 --> 06:37:05.180
That would poke your eye out

06:37:05.180 --> 06:37:06.180
That's what I'm saying

06:37:06.180 --> 06:37:07.180
That's what I'm gonna leave out

06:37:07.180 --> 06:37:08.180
That would poke your eye out

06:37:08.180 --> 06:37:09.180
Um

06:37:11.180 --> 06:37:14.180
Oh she's so damn bad just like us

06:37:14.180 --> 06:37:16.180
Keep being that lovable goofy gibber you are

06:37:16.180 --> 06:37:18.180
Oh thank you Reefling

06:37:18.180 --> 06:37:20.180
Strony

06:37:20.180 --> 06:37:21.180
Reefling

06:37:21.180 --> 06:37:24.180
I listened to the girlfriend begs the whole day tomorrow

06:37:24.180 --> 06:37:27.180
I remembered you apologizing but no editing as much

06:37:27.180 --> 06:37:30.180
I think at least in this case less editing

06:37:30.180 --> 06:37:32.180
I think added to the quality

06:37:32.180 --> 06:37:35.180
I'm so frickin glad you agree Reefling

06:37:35.180 --> 06:37:41.180
I have been enjoying like not doing scripted stuff and try hard in

06:37:41.180 --> 06:37:42.180
Um

06:37:44.180 --> 06:37:45.180
Um

06:37:45.180 --> 06:37:49.180
Like I have been enjoying recording ASMR

06:37:49.180 --> 06:37:53.180
That isn't scripted and I'm doing it off the top of my head

06:37:53.180 --> 06:37:54.180
Wait what do you say

06:37:54.180 --> 06:37:56.180
There was one part where you seemed to accidentally say

06:37:56.180 --> 06:37:58.180
Let me hold your fireman

06:37:58.180 --> 06:38:00.180
Then wait let me hold your hose Mr. Fireman

06:38:00.180 --> 06:38:01.180
It felt so natural

06:38:01.180 --> 06:38:03.180
Cause of how frantic you were becoming

06:38:03.180 --> 06:38:06.180
Yeah cause I did it all off the top of my head

06:38:06.180 --> 06:38:07.180
Um

06:38:07.180 --> 06:38:10.180
I don't know if it was scripted but you also yawned at one point

06:38:10.180 --> 06:38:12.180
If it was intentional or adlib it was so natural

06:38:12.180 --> 06:38:16.180
No I've been enjoying doing like non hyper edited

06:38:16.180 --> 06:38:18.180
Super production of the wazoo

06:38:18.180 --> 06:38:20.180
I've been enjoying doing like such casual

06:38:20.180 --> 06:38:22.180
Um it's been so lovely

06:38:22.180 --> 06:38:24.180
I've been enjoying it thoroughly

06:38:24.180 --> 06:38:27.180
I really hope you enjoy the first like thank you for 1000 subs

06:38:27.180 --> 06:38:29.180
Cause it's just me meemen

06:38:29.180 --> 06:38:30.180
Um

06:38:30.180 --> 06:38:32.180
I'm back from work

06:38:33.180 --> 06:38:36.180
Okay but how many scrawny hands big was it

06:38:36.180 --> 06:38:38.180
I mean

06:38:38.180 --> 06:38:41.180
There wasn't a ruler in the picture but

06:38:41.180 --> 06:38:44.180
From the glance I got before I closed it

06:38:44.180 --> 06:38:47.180
It was pretty

06:38:49.180 --> 06:38:51.180
I laughed so much in that part

06:38:51.180 --> 06:38:54.180
I don't know if it was scripted or not

06:38:54.180 --> 06:38:57.180
But if any of it was scripted

06:38:57.180 --> 06:38:59.180
That kind of reinforces my point

06:38:59.180 --> 06:39:00.180
So much of the audio scripted

06:39:00.180 --> 06:39:02.180
Or not felt natural even the mistakes seemed

06:39:02.180 --> 06:39:04.180
No no that was just me

06:39:04.180 --> 06:39:06.180
That's just me being unable to read

06:39:06.180 --> 06:39:07.180
Unable to read

06:39:07.180 --> 06:39:10.180
Unable to formulate my thoughts

06:39:10.180 --> 06:39:12.180
Into our proper sentence structure

06:39:12.180 --> 06:39:14.180
I know it was just the meme but it was really fun

06:39:14.180 --> 06:39:16.180
And good I think it would be neat

06:39:16.180 --> 06:39:18.180
To do the natural style more

06:39:18.180 --> 06:39:19.180
I freaking agree

06:39:19.180 --> 06:39:21.180
I 100% am doing natural style

06:39:21.180 --> 06:39:23.180
Open natural style

06:39:23.180 --> 06:39:25.180
A

06:39:25.180 --> 06:39:27.180
Six a lady

06:39:27.180 --> 06:39:29.180
What

06:39:29.180 --> 06:39:31.180
It was too early sorry

06:39:32.180 --> 06:39:34.180
Okay we're all

06:39:34.180 --> 06:39:36.180
As I said we're gonna finish cooking all the swordfish

06:39:36.180 --> 06:39:38.180
And then we'll go back to wine

06:39:38.180 --> 06:39:41.180
Just cause wine is so demanding

06:39:42.180 --> 06:39:44.180
Um

06:39:45.180 --> 06:39:47.180
If you want to help hold the hose

06:39:47.180 --> 06:39:49.180
During a number one does that mean

06:39:49.180 --> 06:39:51.180
I get to hold you up when you go number one

06:39:51.180 --> 06:39:52.180
Bruh

06:39:52.180 --> 06:39:55.180
I would go everywhere if you did that

06:39:56.180 --> 06:39:58.180
Um

06:39:59.180 --> 06:40:00.180
Strony

06:40:00.180 --> 06:40:02.180
I felt it's imperative to let you know

06:40:02.180 --> 06:40:04.180
There's a fortnite skin called Tropical Punch Zoe

06:40:04.180 --> 06:40:06.180
That looks shockingly like you

06:40:09.180 --> 06:40:12.180
I swear to god if I look like a fortnite character

06:40:14.180 --> 06:40:16.180
If I look like a fortnite

06:40:17.180 --> 06:40:19.180
Ahh

06:40:21.180 --> 06:40:23.180
I can

06:40:23.180 --> 06:40:25.180
I can cane to see it

06:40:25.180 --> 06:40:27.180
I know what you mean with the bows on our heads

06:40:29.180 --> 06:40:30.180
I get it

06:40:30.180 --> 06:40:31.180
Yeah I get it

06:40:31.180 --> 06:40:32.180
No that's not bad

06:40:32.180 --> 06:40:34.180
Thankfully I don't look too much

06:40:34.180 --> 06:40:36.180
Like

06:40:36.180 --> 06:40:38.180
But I get it

06:40:40.180 --> 06:40:43.180
Would only need to ask once to hold off

06:40:44.180 --> 06:40:46.180
By the way the subtitles were actually fun

06:40:47.180 --> 06:40:49.180
But why didn't you

06:40:49.180 --> 06:40:51.180
Make someone else do them

06:40:51.180 --> 06:40:53.180
Well when I do all that stuff

06:40:53.180 --> 06:40:54.180
There's like

06:40:54.180 --> 06:40:55.180
No

06:40:55.180 --> 06:40:57.180
Subtitling takes so much time

06:40:57.180 --> 06:40:59.180
It's just such a waste of money as well

06:40:59.180 --> 06:41:01.180
Cause not everyone reads subtitles

06:41:03.180 --> 06:41:06.180
To like outsource that work even further

06:41:06.180 --> 06:41:07.180
Is just like

06:41:07.180 --> 06:41:09.180
I'd rather just save the money

06:41:09.180 --> 06:41:11.180
And spend it on the girls type thing

06:41:11.180 --> 06:41:13.180
Because I could have sent that to an editor

06:41:13.180 --> 06:41:16.180
And I could have sent that to a video renderer type thing

06:41:16.180 --> 06:41:17.180
It's just like

06:41:17.180 --> 06:41:19.180
I'll just do it myself

06:41:19.180 --> 06:41:21.180
You know

06:41:25.180 --> 06:41:27.180
Ooh I've got 14 more questions

06:41:27.180 --> 06:41:29.180
Don't mind me

06:41:29.180 --> 06:41:31.180
Or is it even a question

06:41:36.180 --> 06:41:38.180
Let me know what you think of that in people

06:41:38.180 --> 06:41:40.180
I'm not doing live reviews right now

06:41:40.180 --> 06:41:41.180
Are you joking me

06:41:41.180 --> 06:41:43.180
You guys are gonna like start hearing yourself

06:41:43.180 --> 06:41:45.180
In the death of audio

06:41:45.180 --> 06:41:47.180
On the topic

06:41:47.180 --> 06:41:49.180
Conspiracy series

06:41:49.180 --> 06:41:51.180
One game would be a hit to what you play

06:41:51.180 --> 06:41:52.180
Disco Asylum

06:41:52.180 --> 06:41:54.180
It's basically a spruced up visual novel

06:41:54.180 --> 06:41:56.180
Where you play as a deeply

06:41:56.180 --> 06:41:58.180
Schizophrenic police officer having a small

06:41:58.180 --> 06:42:01.180
Solve a murder while constantly arguing with the voices

06:42:01.180 --> 06:42:03.180
All that's interesting

06:42:03.180 --> 06:42:05.180
Hold on that looks like nice and niche

06:42:05.180 --> 06:42:07.180
Let me give that a cheeky go

06:42:07.180 --> 06:42:09.180
Oh god I was preemptive again

06:42:10.180 --> 06:42:12.180
We're at 4.8 on our

06:42:13.180 --> 06:42:15.180
But nothing happens at all

06:42:23.180 --> 06:42:25.180
Okay I can't open that on stream

06:42:25.180 --> 06:42:27.180
But you know what you've sent

06:42:27.180 --> 06:42:29.180
I love your long streams

06:42:29.180 --> 06:42:30.180
I can do my thing

06:42:30.180 --> 06:42:32.180
Even go to sleep when I'm back

06:42:32.180 --> 06:42:33.180
And you're still there

06:42:33.180 --> 06:42:34.180
Thank you for your work

06:42:34.180 --> 06:42:36.180
Oh you're more than welcome

06:42:36.180 --> 06:42:38.180
I'm glad I can help you

06:42:38.180 --> 06:42:40.180
Get ready for working stuff

06:42:40.180 --> 06:42:42.180
Listen to me in the background

06:42:42.180 --> 06:42:44.180
And then I'm bing-ching when you get back

06:42:45.180 --> 06:42:47.180
The kicking sound in old school

06:42:47.180 --> 06:42:48.180
Runescape is printed

06:42:48.180 --> 06:42:50.180
Oh do you want it off?

06:42:56.180 --> 06:42:57.180
Do you want it off?

06:42:57.180 --> 06:42:59.180
Or do you want it a little?

06:43:00.180 --> 06:43:02.180
I can't even hear it at 2%

06:43:02.180 --> 06:43:04.180
You know that 4%

06:43:06.180 --> 06:43:07.180
There

06:43:08.180 --> 06:43:10.180
I'm gonna like blast your ears

06:43:12.180 --> 06:43:14.180
The voices in my head stop

06:43:14.180 --> 06:43:15.180
Thank you

06:43:15.180 --> 06:43:16.180
Wait why do you

06:43:16.180 --> 06:43:17.180
Oh I like them

06:43:17.180 --> 06:43:18.180
Ah please

06:43:18.180 --> 06:43:21.180
Wait why do you guys not tell me so much earlier

06:43:21.180 --> 06:43:23.180
I'm sorry I didn't mean to subject you

06:43:23.180 --> 06:43:25.180
To such

06:43:25.180 --> 06:43:27.180
Fallacies?

06:43:27.180 --> 06:43:28.180
Fallacies?

06:43:28.180 --> 06:43:30.180
I don't think that's the correct word

06:43:30.180 --> 06:43:32.180
But I'm glad you're trying to use words

06:43:32.180 --> 06:43:34.180
Outside your comfort zone

06:43:35.180 --> 06:43:37.180
Hey Strone

06:43:37.180 --> 06:43:39.180
Just wondering when you plan on sitting on my face

06:43:39.180 --> 06:43:40.180
Right now

06:43:41.180 --> 06:43:42.180
Lie down

06:43:47.180 --> 06:43:49.180
Since AI is blowing up

06:43:49.180 --> 06:43:50.180
Right now

06:43:50.180 --> 06:43:52.180
Any ideas of implementing it in your content?

06:43:53.180 --> 06:43:54.180
No

06:43:54.180 --> 06:43:56.180
And do you even want to implement it?

06:43:56.180 --> 06:43:58.180
I

06:44:03.180 --> 06:44:05.180
The only

06:44:05.180 --> 06:44:07.180
I wouldn't put

06:44:07.180 --> 06:44:09.180
AI content

06:44:09.180 --> 06:44:10.180
Like monetize it

06:44:10.180 --> 06:44:12.180
I don't think that's right

06:44:12.180 --> 06:44:14.180
I don't mind like AI memes of myself

06:44:14.180 --> 06:44:15.180
Or something like that

06:44:15.180 --> 06:44:16.180
Like that's funny

06:44:19.180 --> 06:44:20.180
But like

06:44:20.180 --> 06:44:21.180
Actually AI content

06:44:21.180 --> 06:44:23.180
Like I wouldn't use AI content

06:44:23.180 --> 06:44:24.180
On a thumbnail

06:44:24.180 --> 06:44:25.180
And then earn money from it

06:44:25.180 --> 06:44:27.180
Like I don't think

06:44:27.180 --> 06:44:28.180
I don't think that's very nice

06:44:28.180 --> 06:44:30.180
Because as a content creator

06:44:30.180 --> 06:44:32.180
Like someone can literally

06:44:32.180 --> 06:44:33.180
You know yank your voice

06:44:33.180 --> 06:44:35.180
And then make money off of it

06:44:35.180 --> 06:44:37.180
And it was like well why would I do the same

06:44:37.180 --> 06:44:38.180
To someone else

06:44:38.180 --> 06:44:39.180
Like that's not nice

06:44:39.180 --> 06:44:41.180
You know

06:44:41.180 --> 06:44:43.180
Can you hold it?

06:44:43.180 --> 06:44:45.180
Do you think you can handle it?

06:44:47.180 --> 06:44:48.180
And

06:44:48.180 --> 06:44:50.180
Have you considered trading a chat box

06:44:50.180 --> 06:44:51.180
From your stream?

06:44:51.180 --> 06:44:52.180
Absolutely not

06:44:52.180 --> 06:44:53.180
Are you kidding me?

06:44:53.180 --> 06:44:54.180
That all that thing we'll see is

06:44:54.180 --> 06:44:55.180
Use the other hole

06:44:55.180 --> 06:44:56.180
Refling

06:44:56.180 --> 06:44:57.180
Other hole

06:44:57.180 --> 06:44:58.180
Other hole

06:44:58.180 --> 06:44:59.180
Other hole

06:44:59.180 --> 06:45:01.180
That all that chat box is going to say

06:45:04.180 --> 06:45:06.180
I don't really use Marshmallow very often

06:45:06.180 --> 06:45:09.180
If someone wanted to send you a bibliote

06:45:09.180 --> 06:45:10.180
How it says

06:45:10.180 --> 06:45:11.180
Oh you do

06:45:11.180 --> 06:45:14.180
What's called a cat box link

06:45:14.180 --> 06:45:16.180
And then you send me the link

06:45:16.180 --> 06:45:18.180
And then I look at the link

06:45:19.180 --> 06:45:21.180
And the rest is history

06:45:23.180 --> 06:45:25.180
Hmm

06:45:28.180 --> 06:45:30.180
ASMR Booth Hypnoscript

06:45:30.180 --> 06:45:32.180
I've already recorded the

06:45:32.180 --> 06:45:34.180
ASMR Booth

06:45:34.180 --> 06:45:35.180
Plot

06:45:35.180 --> 06:45:37.180
Which was funny as anything

06:45:37.180 --> 06:45:39.180
I haven't

06:45:39.180 --> 06:45:41.180
Done too much

06:45:41.180 --> 06:45:42.180
Hypno

06:45:42.180 --> 06:45:43.180
Because

06:45:43.180 --> 06:45:45.180
Of Patreon's restrictions

06:45:45.180 --> 06:45:47.180
But I do have a four part series

06:45:47.180 --> 06:45:49.180
That will go up

06:45:50.180 --> 06:45:52.180
On the alternate Twitter for free

06:45:52.180 --> 06:45:55.180
Because it's not welcome

06:45:55.180 --> 06:45:57.180
And the replacement audio

06:45:57.180 --> 06:46:00.180
Is going to be my honey cup of tea

06:46:00.180 --> 06:46:02.180
Oops sorry

06:46:03.180 --> 06:46:05.180
I'm losing it

06:46:05.180 --> 06:46:06.180
I don't know

06:46:06.180 --> 06:46:08.180
I don't know why I'm like so sleepy

06:46:08.180 --> 06:46:09.180
After eating

06:46:09.180 --> 06:46:11.180
I thought you were supposed to get energy from food

06:46:11.180 --> 06:46:13.180
You lied to me

06:46:13.180 --> 06:46:15.180
Will you permanently scramble my brain

06:46:15.180 --> 06:46:16.180
Pretty pretty please

06:46:16.180 --> 06:46:17.180
Aw I can't do that

06:46:17.180 --> 06:46:19.180
You're supposed to

06:46:19.180 --> 06:46:21.180
Be having a good time

06:46:25.180 --> 06:46:26.180
Just

06:46:26.180 --> 06:46:27.180
Pinching

06:46:27.180 --> 06:46:29.180
Hypnosis as a concept

06:46:31.180 --> 06:46:34.180
Make great hypnotic focal point

06:46:34.180 --> 06:46:35.180
As you sway back and forth

06:46:35.180 --> 06:46:36.180
And burn yourself and down

06:46:36.180 --> 06:46:37.180
Have you seen

06:46:37.180 --> 06:46:39.180
The derriere VTuber models

06:46:39.180 --> 06:46:41.180
That you can get

06:46:41.180 --> 06:46:43.180
I wouldn't mind that honestly

06:46:43.180 --> 06:46:45.180
I think that would be good

06:46:46.180 --> 06:46:47.180
Hey mom

06:46:47.180 --> 06:46:49.180
Congrats on the second week of debut

06:46:49.180 --> 06:46:50.180
I'm one of the newer Mifflin

06:46:50.180 --> 06:46:51.180
Hi

06:46:51.180 --> 06:46:52.180
Hi Mifflin

06:46:52.180 --> 06:46:53.180
I must say

06:46:53.180 --> 06:46:55.180
Your constant chatting has become a daily routine

06:46:55.180 --> 06:46:56.180
In my life

06:46:56.180 --> 06:46:58.180
And completely infatuated with you

06:46:58.180 --> 06:46:59.180
Mostly with you

06:46:59.180 --> 06:47:00.180
And your girls

06:47:00.180 --> 06:47:01.180
So thanks

06:47:01.180 --> 06:47:02.180
Oh no thank you

06:47:02.180 --> 06:47:03.180
Thank you for being open to

06:47:03.180 --> 06:47:05.180
A new like line of content

06:47:05.180 --> 06:47:07.180
You made me really happy

06:47:07.180 --> 06:47:08.180
In this vacation

06:47:08.180 --> 06:47:10.180
And I'm excited for the Lord of the Rings marathon

06:47:10.180 --> 06:47:11.180
On Christmas

06:47:12.180 --> 06:47:13.180
Oh and

06:47:14.180 --> 06:47:16.180
If there's a question

06:47:16.180 --> 06:47:18.180
When can we expect your membership streams

06:47:18.180 --> 06:47:20.180
Membership streams start next week

06:47:20.180 --> 06:47:22.180
You will see it on the schedule

06:47:22.180 --> 06:47:23.180
That I post publicly

06:47:26.180 --> 06:47:27.180
That

06:47:27.180 --> 06:47:29.180
Will go live

06:47:29.180 --> 06:47:30.180
After

06:47:30.180 --> 06:47:31.180
Buckshot

06:47:31.180 --> 06:47:32.180
Roulette

06:47:32.180 --> 06:47:33.180
Is when it will go up

06:47:33.180 --> 06:47:35.180
There are three member streams

06:47:35.180 --> 06:47:36.180
In the first week

06:47:36.180 --> 06:47:38.180
And we'll take it from there

06:47:38.180 --> 06:47:40.180
And see how we're doing

06:47:40.180 --> 06:47:42.180
How we're doing

06:47:42.180 --> 06:47:43.180
Remember vibing

06:47:45.180 --> 06:47:46.180
Actually no idea

06:47:46.180 --> 06:47:47.180
What this is

06:47:47.180 --> 06:47:48.180
I need

06:47:49.180 --> 06:47:51.180
I think it's called like cat box

06:47:51.180 --> 06:47:52.180
Litter box

06:47:52.180 --> 06:47:53.180
Or something like that

06:47:54.180 --> 06:47:56.180
Is for long enough

06:47:56.180 --> 06:47:57.180
Asking for a friend

06:47:57.180 --> 06:47:58.180
Replay

06:48:00.180 --> 06:48:02.180
Did me mentioning ovulation

06:48:02.180 --> 06:48:04.180
Get you all riled up

06:48:07.180 --> 06:48:09.180
I was going to show

06:48:09.180 --> 06:48:10.180
On

06:48:11.180 --> 06:48:12.180
Bansley

06:48:16.180 --> 06:48:18.180
Some stuff later on

06:48:21.180 --> 06:48:23.180
We're hired wired that way

06:48:25.180 --> 06:48:27.180
More than enough

06:48:27.180 --> 06:48:29.180
I need to cut the booth

06:48:32.180 --> 06:48:34.180
Keep doing that early

06:48:34.180 --> 06:48:36.180
I'm not max

06:48:36.180 --> 06:48:37.180
A burnt one

06:48:38.180 --> 06:48:39.180
Brave

06:48:41.180 --> 06:48:43.180
I burnt a swordfish

06:48:43.180 --> 06:48:44.180
Who am I?

06:48:44.180 --> 06:48:45.180
Who do I think I am?

06:48:45.180 --> 06:48:46.180
Just wasting

06:48:46.180 --> 06:48:47.180
Litter box

06:48:48.180 --> 06:48:50.180
Is time for a cat box

06:48:50.180 --> 06:48:51.180
Is the three days

06:48:54.180 --> 06:48:56.180
Why is this website Japanese?

06:48:56.180 --> 06:48:57.180
I can't speak Japanese

06:48:57.180 --> 06:48:58.180
Can you speak Japanese?

06:48:58.180 --> 06:48:59.180
No

06:49:00.180 --> 06:49:02.180
Why did you pick a Japanese website then?

06:49:02.180 --> 06:49:04.180
I thought you were the gamer of the six

06:49:04.180 --> 06:49:05.180
Not a weeb

06:49:05.180 --> 06:49:06.180
I still love you, you dork

06:49:06.180 --> 06:49:08.180
The other websites that offer

06:49:08.180 --> 06:49:09.180
This kind of Q&A thing

06:49:09.180 --> 06:49:11.180
Are very broken

06:49:11.180 --> 06:49:12.180
Cat box

06:49:12.180 --> 06:49:14.180
Curious

06:49:14.180 --> 06:49:15.180
Cat

06:49:15.180 --> 06:49:17.180
Is very broken

06:49:17.180 --> 06:49:19.180
So however

06:49:19.180 --> 06:49:20.180
This Japanese website

06:49:20.180 --> 06:49:21.180
Called Marshmallow

06:49:21.180 --> 06:49:22.180
Isn't broken

06:49:22.180 --> 06:49:24.180
It's actually very highly functional

06:49:24.180 --> 06:49:26.180
Other than the filters

06:49:26.180 --> 06:49:27.180
You have to be a smart level

06:49:27.180 --> 06:49:28.180
Refling

06:49:28.180 --> 06:49:30.180
And bypass the filters

06:49:32.180 --> 06:49:33.180
Have you thought of more games

06:49:33.180 --> 06:49:35.180
You can play in stream snipes

06:49:35.180 --> 06:49:36.180
With the whole chat

06:49:36.180 --> 06:49:37.180
In the future

06:49:37.180 --> 06:49:38.180
After you get 99k

06:49:38.180 --> 06:49:39.180
Absolutely

06:49:39.180 --> 06:49:40.180
Every week

06:49:40.180 --> 06:49:41.180
I plan on doing

06:49:41.180 --> 06:49:43.180
Some version of a stream snip game

06:49:45.180 --> 06:49:46.180
You burn swordfish

06:49:46.180 --> 06:49:47.180
Until 80 on a range

06:49:47.180 --> 06:49:49.180
And 86 on a fire

06:49:51.180 --> 06:49:52.180
Yes, no

06:49:52.180 --> 06:49:53.180
There's plenty

06:49:53.180 --> 06:49:54.180
So Elden Ring

06:49:54.180 --> 06:49:55.180
Is our next stream snip game

06:49:55.180 --> 06:49:56.180
That we'll be doing

06:49:56.180 --> 06:49:57.180
Tons of

06:49:57.180 --> 06:49:58.180
November

06:49:58.180 --> 06:49:59.180
I know it's quite far away

06:49:59.180 --> 06:50:00.180
November

06:50:00.180 --> 06:50:02.180
Definitely lots of Isaac

06:50:02.180 --> 06:50:03.180
And

06:50:04.180 --> 06:50:06.180
I was going to do

06:50:06.180 --> 06:50:07.180
Drunk Apex

06:50:07.180 --> 06:50:08.180
But everyone rolled their eyes

06:50:08.180 --> 06:50:10.180
At me at the same time

06:50:10.180 --> 06:50:11.180
So maybe not Drunk Apex

06:50:11.180 --> 06:50:12.180
I don't know

06:50:13.180 --> 06:50:15.180
Some sort of drunk multiplayer game

06:50:15.180 --> 06:50:16.180
I think Valorant

06:50:16.180 --> 06:50:18.180
Also gets shot on as well

06:50:18.180 --> 06:50:19.180
And I'm like

06:50:19.180 --> 06:50:20.180
But I can have

06:50:20.180 --> 06:50:21.180
Four other

06:50:21.180 --> 06:50:23.180
Reflings in the lobby

06:50:28.180 --> 06:50:29.180
But you

06:50:30.180 --> 06:50:31.180
Ugh

06:50:31.180 --> 06:50:32.180
How do we

06:50:32.180 --> 06:50:33.180
I guess

06:50:33.180 --> 06:50:34.180
So sleepy after I ate that food

06:50:34.180 --> 06:50:35.180
I don't understand

06:50:35.180 --> 06:50:37.180
I had eight hours of sleep

06:50:47.180 --> 06:50:48.180
Uhh

06:50:52.180 --> 06:50:53.180
You didn't answer

06:50:53.180 --> 06:50:54.180
The question

06:50:54.180 --> 06:50:55.180
How BB is four enough

06:50:55.180 --> 06:50:56.180
Yeah

06:50:56.180 --> 06:50:57.180
Don't be silly

06:50:57.180 --> 06:50:58.180
Of course it is

06:51:00.180 --> 06:51:01.180
Are you going to have

06:51:01.180 --> 06:51:03.180
A password set up on Elden Ring

06:51:03.180 --> 06:51:04.180
So you can only summon

06:51:04.180 --> 06:51:05.180
Reflings

06:51:05.180 --> 06:51:06.180
Yeah, of course

06:51:07.180 --> 06:51:08.180
Maybe call it shell

06:51:10.180 --> 06:51:11.180
Or eyes

06:51:11.180 --> 06:51:12.180
Because I hypnotise you

06:51:12.180 --> 06:51:13.180
With my

06:51:13.180 --> 06:51:14.180
Eyes

06:51:16.180 --> 06:51:17.180
But yes

06:51:17.180 --> 06:51:18.180
There'll be two

06:51:18.180 --> 06:51:19.180
Good reflings

06:51:19.180 --> 06:51:20.180
And one bad refling

06:51:20.180 --> 06:51:22.180
Like an invader

06:51:22.180 --> 06:51:23.180
So we can

06:51:23.180 --> 06:51:24.180
We don't get a bonsai

06:51:24.180 --> 06:51:25.180
Bonsai

06:51:26.180 --> 06:51:28.180
I thought you needed ten hours

06:51:28.180 --> 06:51:29.180
Maybe that's why

06:51:30.180 --> 06:51:31.180
A big

06:51:31.180 --> 06:51:33.180
It wasn't even a big meal

06:51:33.180 --> 06:51:35.180
I literally had a muffin

06:51:35.180 --> 06:51:37.180
In a nature valley bar

06:51:37.180 --> 06:51:38.180
A cup of tea

06:51:38.180 --> 06:51:39.180
A cold-out which I've not even

06:51:39.180 --> 06:51:40.180
Finished in some water

06:51:40.180 --> 06:51:41.180
And my brain's like

06:51:41.180 --> 06:51:42.180
Okay, let's go down again

06:51:42.180 --> 06:51:43.180
I'm like

06:51:43.180 --> 06:51:44.180
Bro

06:51:44.180 --> 06:51:45.180
We're not even halfway

06:51:45.180 --> 06:51:46.180
Through this endurance stream

06:51:50.180 --> 06:51:51.180
So I heard

06:51:51.180 --> 06:51:52.180
Mummy was ovulating

06:51:52.180 --> 06:51:54.180
Ambient refling

06:51:54.180 --> 06:51:55.180
Cicero

06:51:55.180 --> 06:51:56.180
Cicero

06:51:57.180 --> 06:51:58.180
Cicero?

06:51:59.180 --> 06:52:00.180
Refling

06:52:00.180 --> 06:52:01.180
Did you take this correctly

06:52:01.180 --> 06:52:02.180
Or did you take it so fast

06:52:02.180 --> 06:52:03.180
You didn't

06:52:03.180 --> 06:52:04.180
You didn't check

06:52:04.180 --> 06:52:05.180
Your spell

06:52:05.180 --> 06:52:06.180
And now I can't read it

06:52:06.180 --> 06:52:07.180
Because I'm too dumb

06:52:09.180 --> 06:52:10.180
Women are EP girls

06:52:10.180 --> 06:52:11.180
I can't believe it

06:52:11.180 --> 06:52:12.180
Someone said

06:52:12.180 --> 06:52:13.180
Plop plop plop plop

06:52:13.180 --> 06:52:14.180
Get pregnant

06:52:14.180 --> 06:52:15.180
Get pregnant

06:52:15.180 --> 06:52:16.180
Get pregnant

06:52:16.180 --> 06:52:17.180
Yeah, you want gen two?

06:52:19.180 --> 06:52:20.180
Johnny

06:52:20.180 --> 06:52:21.180
I can't wait to be permanently

06:52:21.180 --> 06:52:22.180
Under your influence

06:52:22.180 --> 06:52:23.180
Oh wait, I already am

06:52:23.180 --> 06:52:24.180
Under your influence

06:52:24.180 --> 06:52:25.180
I can't get over this trance

06:52:25.180 --> 06:52:26.180
Love you mumme

06:52:26.180 --> 06:52:27.180
Love you refling

06:52:29.180 --> 06:52:30.180
Someone says

06:52:30.180 --> 06:52:31.180
I want you

06:52:32.180 --> 06:52:33.180
Good thing I'm ovulating

06:52:33.180 --> 06:52:34.180
I want you too

06:52:34.180 --> 06:52:35.180
Refling

06:52:43.180 --> 06:52:44.180
On your my fire

06:52:44.180 --> 06:52:45.180
It's gone

06:52:45.180 --> 06:52:46.180
I distracted the refling

06:52:46.180 --> 06:52:47.180
So much we forgot

06:52:47.180 --> 06:52:48.180
To keep up the fire

06:52:49.180 --> 06:52:50.180
Thank you for the fire

06:52:52.180 --> 06:52:53.180
GGs

06:52:53.180 --> 06:52:54.180
That'll be well lasted

06:52:56.180 --> 06:52:57.180
Even the runescaper

06:52:57.180 --> 06:52:58.180
Is there one handed right now

06:53:00.180 --> 06:53:01.180
Why do you stream at 4am

06:53:01.180 --> 06:53:02.180
And why is this the time

06:53:02.180 --> 06:53:03.180
You wake up to stream

06:53:03.180 --> 06:53:04.180
Is it just a spay

06:53:04.180 --> 06:53:05.180
Be in particular

06:53:06.180 --> 06:53:07.180
No

06:53:07.180 --> 06:53:08.180
Also thoughts on Aussie

06:53:08.180 --> 06:53:09.180
AFL

06:53:09.180 --> 06:53:10.180
Very violent

06:53:10.180 --> 06:53:11.180
Very violent

06:53:12.180 --> 06:53:13.180
I've seen some slaps

06:53:13.180 --> 06:53:14.180
I've seen some slaps

06:53:14.180 --> 06:53:15.180
I've seen some slaps

06:53:15.180 --> 06:53:16.180
I've seen some slaps

06:53:17.180 --> 06:53:18.180
I've seen some slow mo

06:53:18.180 --> 06:53:19.180
Nox

06:53:19.180 --> 06:53:20.180
Or the AFL

06:53:20.180 --> 06:53:21.180
It's pretty scary

06:53:21.180 --> 06:53:22.180
I want to go see a match

06:53:22.180 --> 06:53:23.180
Like in person

06:53:23.180 --> 06:53:24.180
Just to be like

06:53:25.180 --> 06:53:26.180
I'm a real Australian citizen

06:53:27.180 --> 06:53:28.180
Wink wink

06:53:29.180 --> 06:53:30.180
Why do you stream at 4am

06:53:31.180 --> 06:53:32.180
I stream at 4am

06:53:33.180 --> 06:53:34.180
Because I'm normally

06:53:34.180 --> 06:53:35.180
An endurance strummer

06:53:36.180 --> 06:53:37.180
Wait, I'm not cooking anymore

06:53:38.180 --> 06:53:39.180
And

06:53:41.180 --> 06:53:43.180
If I need to go to a doctor's appointment

06:53:43.180 --> 06:53:44.180
Or if I need

06:53:44.180 --> 06:53:45.180
No DOOM

06:53:45.180 --> 06:53:46.180
No DOOM

06:53:46.180 --> 06:53:47.180
Refling

06:53:48.180 --> 06:53:49.180
Or I need to

06:53:49.180 --> 06:53:50.180
You know, go shopping

06:53:50.180 --> 06:53:52.180
Or I need to go

06:53:53.180 --> 06:53:55.180
See my Chinese grandma

06:53:55.180 --> 06:53:56.180
At the shop

06:53:56.180 --> 06:53:57.180
I look squid in mirror right now

06:53:57.180 --> 06:53:58.180
Wah!

06:54:01.180 --> 06:54:02.180
Oh, Brian doesn't read it out

06:54:02.180 --> 06:54:03.180
Don't worry, I'll read it out

06:54:04.180 --> 06:54:06.180
KFP Spidey says

06:54:06.180 --> 06:54:08.180
Thank you for the stream so far

06:54:08.180 --> 06:54:09.180
It's been great listening

06:54:09.180 --> 06:54:11.180
While I pack for my move

06:54:11.180 --> 06:54:13.180
I was also the red guy

06:54:13.180 --> 06:54:15.180
Dancing at the saddle too

06:54:16.180 --> 06:54:17.180
Thank you, Brian

06:54:18.180 --> 06:54:19.180
And thank you

06:54:19.180 --> 06:54:20.180
KFP Spidey

06:54:20.180 --> 06:54:21.180
For the five

06:54:21.180 --> 06:54:22.180
I appreciate it

06:54:22.180 --> 06:54:24.180
I'm sorry, I can't do Brian's voice

06:54:26.180 --> 06:54:27.180
I'm so sorry

06:54:27.180 --> 06:54:28.180
I tried my best

06:54:31.180 --> 06:54:32.180
My sister

06:54:32.180 --> 06:54:33.180
Pleased in the AFL

06:54:33.180 --> 06:54:35.180
She's messed up with a bump

06:54:35.180 --> 06:54:36.180
She too

06:54:36.180 --> 06:54:37.180
It is so dangerous

06:54:37.180 --> 06:54:38.180
Like the head trauma

06:54:38.180 --> 06:54:39.180
You can get

06:54:39.180 --> 06:54:40.180
Or like cauliflower ears

06:54:40.180 --> 06:54:41.180
If you get blunt force

06:54:41.180 --> 06:54:43.180
Trama to your ears by the way

06:54:43.180 --> 06:54:45.180
You get a condition called

06:54:45.180 --> 06:54:46.180
Cauliflower ears

06:54:46.180 --> 06:54:47.180
Where they like spike up

06:54:47.180 --> 06:54:48.180
Spike up?

06:54:48.180 --> 06:54:49.180
Did he spike up?

06:54:49.180 --> 06:54:50.180
Is that right?

06:54:52.180 --> 06:54:53.180
But yeah, thank you so much

06:54:53.180 --> 06:54:55.180
But please do not feel forced

06:54:55.180 --> 06:54:56.180
To hang about

06:54:56.180 --> 06:54:57.180
If you're getting a bit tired

06:54:57.180 --> 06:54:59.180
Azura Dooley is currently playing

06:54:59.180 --> 06:55:00.180
Meow

06:55:02.180 --> 06:55:03.180
Meow

06:55:03.180 --> 06:55:04.180
A bit of stray

06:55:04.180 --> 06:55:05.180
A bit of meow

06:55:06.180 --> 06:55:07.180
Oh wait

06:55:07.180 --> 06:55:08.180
No, not on the ashes

06:55:08.180 --> 06:55:09.180
On the fire

06:55:10.180 --> 06:55:11.180
Don't be silly

06:55:11.180 --> 06:55:12.180
Scottlefish

06:55:15.180 --> 06:55:17.180
What is Arsonist Rufland in?

06:55:18.180 --> 06:55:19.180
The Wayne certainly helped

06:55:19.180 --> 06:55:20.180
With the burn rate

06:55:21.180 --> 06:55:23.180
Down to 13.7

06:55:24.180 --> 06:55:26.180
Actually, yeah, you're right

06:55:26.180 --> 06:55:27.180
I thought you were a meme in there

06:55:27.180 --> 06:55:28.180
You said that

06:55:29.180 --> 06:55:30.180
But no, I do not stream

06:55:30.180 --> 06:55:32.180
At 4am to spay any Aussies

06:55:33.180 --> 06:55:34.180
I do it because

06:55:36.180 --> 06:55:38.180
I'm actually a knight

06:55:38.180 --> 06:55:39.180
I will

06:55:41.180 --> 06:55:42.180
Buy default

06:55:43.180 --> 06:55:45.180
So it's actually quite helpful

06:55:45.180 --> 06:55:47.180
That I stream at this time

06:55:47.180 --> 06:55:49.180
If I were to stream at 10am

06:55:49.180 --> 06:55:51.180
Because that was the other slot

06:55:51.180 --> 06:55:52.180
Imagine being an Aussie at like

06:55:52.180 --> 06:55:54.180
Oh no, shock of behaviour

06:55:54.180 --> 06:55:56.180
Imagine getting granted citizenship

06:55:56.180 --> 06:55:58.180
Wouldn't that be crazy?

06:55:59.180 --> 06:56:00.180
Wouldn't that be crazy?

06:56:00.180 --> 06:56:02.180
I say that as if I'm not going back to Scotland

06:56:02.180 --> 06:56:03.180
You know that

06:56:03.180 --> 06:56:05.180
Fuckin' spend how much money on that?

06:56:05.180 --> 06:56:06.180
I'll say this again

06:56:06.180 --> 06:56:08.180
If you ever want to run a business

06:56:08.180 --> 06:56:09.180
And you're either

06:56:09.180 --> 06:56:11.180
You can do it in the UK

06:56:11.180 --> 06:56:12.180
Or you can do it in Aus

06:56:12.180 --> 06:56:13.180
Do it in Aus

06:56:13.180 --> 06:56:14.180
You will make

06:56:14.180 --> 06:56:15.180
You will get to keep a lot more

06:56:15.180 --> 06:56:16.180
Of your money

06:56:16.180 --> 06:56:18.180
Because of tax purposes

06:56:18.180 --> 06:56:20.180
If you set it up in the UK

06:56:20.180 --> 06:56:21.180
You're just

06:56:21.180 --> 06:56:23.180
Getting absolutely blasted

06:56:27.180 --> 06:56:28.180
Brian should now work

06:56:28.180 --> 06:56:29.180
On those super chats

06:56:29.180 --> 06:56:30.180
If you want to replay

06:56:30.180 --> 06:56:31.180
Wait, hold on

06:56:31.180 --> 06:56:32.180
Can I replay?

06:56:33.180 --> 06:56:35.180
Thanks for the stream so far

06:56:35.180 --> 06:56:36.180
It's been great listening

06:56:36.180 --> 06:56:38.180
While I've had it for my move

06:56:38.180 --> 06:56:40.180
I was also the red guy dancing

06:56:40.180 --> 06:56:41.180
At the start of the stream

06:56:41.180 --> 06:56:43.180
Yay, Brian works though

06:56:43.180 --> 06:56:44.180
Okay, I do apologize

06:56:44.180 --> 06:56:46.180
To any super chatters who didn't

06:56:46.180 --> 06:56:47.180
Wait, hold on

06:56:47.180 --> 06:56:48.180
Wait, I can replay the super chats

06:56:48.180 --> 06:56:49.180
Are you squinting me?

06:56:49.180 --> 06:56:51.180
I love Stronee as my mommy wife

06:56:51.180 --> 06:56:53.180
And she has boing bully

06:56:56.180 --> 06:56:57.180
I wear her

06:56:57.180 --> 06:56:59.180
Okay, these are replays

06:56:59.180 --> 06:57:00.180
Wait, what?

06:57:00.180 --> 06:57:02.180
Are you squinting me right now?

06:57:03.180 --> 06:57:05.180
I love Stronee as my mommy wife

06:57:05.180 --> 06:57:07.180
And she has boing bully

06:57:07.180 --> 06:57:08.180
And she has boing boing

06:57:08.180 --> 06:57:10.180
She has boing boing

06:57:11.180 --> 06:57:13.180
Thank you, Brian, for your...

06:57:15.180 --> 06:57:16.180
Oh, no

06:57:16.180 --> 06:57:18.180
Is camp log refling gone?

06:57:19.180 --> 06:57:20.180
Paramount camp log?

06:57:20.180 --> 06:57:21.180
I can't believe it

06:57:21.180 --> 06:57:23.180
I can't believe

06:57:23.180 --> 06:57:25.180
My poor refling has things to do

06:57:27.180 --> 06:57:29.180
Do you have a VR headset?

06:57:29.180 --> 06:57:30.180
I don't

06:57:30.180 --> 06:57:31.180
Not yet

06:57:31.180 --> 06:57:32.180
It might be plausible

06:57:32.180 --> 06:57:33.180
I'll be getting one

06:57:33.180 --> 06:57:35.180
Because I think...

06:57:39.180 --> 06:57:40.180
75?

06:57:40.180 --> 06:57:41.180
Oh, my God

06:57:41.180 --> 06:57:43.180
Members can now cook

06:57:43.180 --> 06:57:44.180
Rock-aids fish

06:57:44.180 --> 06:57:45.180
And

06:57:46.180 --> 06:57:47.180
Bats

06:57:47.180 --> 06:57:49.180
Are you squinting me right now?

06:57:50.180 --> 06:57:52.180
Guess who's back, Stronee?

06:57:52.180 --> 06:57:53.180
It's me

06:57:53.180 --> 06:57:55.180
How are things going here?

06:57:55.180 --> 06:57:57.180
I'm level 30

06:57:57.180 --> 06:57:58.180
75

06:57:58.180 --> 06:58:00.180
Sorry, I have numbered dyslexia

06:58:02.180 --> 06:58:04.180
I was going so well

06:58:05.180 --> 06:58:06.180
I'm at 75

06:58:09.180 --> 06:58:10.180
Jack

06:58:10.180 --> 06:58:12.180
Thank you for the two

06:58:13.180 --> 06:58:14.180
I appreciate it

06:58:14.180 --> 06:58:16.180
Wait, where the heck did that one go?

06:58:18.180 --> 06:58:20.180
And tiny spain-ee

06:58:21.180 --> 06:58:22.180
Tiny spain-ee

06:58:23.180 --> 06:58:24.180
Thank you

06:58:24.180 --> 06:58:25.180
For the...

06:58:25.180 --> 06:58:26.180
Sorry, I'm a bit...

06:58:26.180 --> 06:58:27.180
I'm not flustered

06:58:27.180 --> 06:58:28.180
That's the wrong...

06:58:28.180 --> 06:58:30.180
I'm just eating food at the bank

06:58:30.180 --> 06:58:31.180
Sorry

06:58:31.180 --> 06:58:32.180
I'm not flustered

06:58:32.180 --> 06:58:35.180
I don't know why my brain is telling me to shut down

06:58:35.180 --> 06:58:36.180
Right now

06:58:36.180 --> 06:58:38.180
I'm literally in the middle

06:58:38.180 --> 06:58:39.180
I'm like, I'm...

06:58:39.180 --> 06:58:40.180
Can you not?

06:58:40.180 --> 06:58:41.180
I'll tell you what

06:58:41.180 --> 06:58:42.180
I'll order food

06:58:43.180 --> 06:58:44.180
I'll order food

06:58:44.180 --> 06:58:47.180
And then I will automatically stay up for that food

06:58:47.180 --> 06:58:48.180
Because I'm like...

06:58:49.180 --> 06:58:50.180
By the way, this is...

06:58:53.180 --> 06:58:54.180
Oh, my God

06:58:54.180 --> 06:58:56.180
I'm gonna say this in stream

06:58:57.180 --> 06:58:59.180
The scriptmaster has just messaged me this

06:59:01.180 --> 06:59:03.180
If I write something about Brocon

06:59:03.180 --> 06:59:04.180
But

06:59:04.180 --> 06:59:07.180
They do not specifically say Big Bro or Sis

06:59:07.180 --> 06:59:08.180
But

06:59:08.180 --> 06:59:09.180
Wait, what?

06:59:09.180 --> 06:59:10.180
Or Big Bro

06:59:10.180 --> 06:59:12.180
But make reference to the same...

06:59:13.180 --> 06:59:14.180
Mother

06:59:14.180 --> 06:59:15.180
Is that against the rules?

06:59:15.180 --> 06:59:16.180
Yes, you can't say that

06:59:16.180 --> 06:59:17.180
Yes

06:59:17.180 --> 06:59:19.180
You can't say that

06:59:20.180 --> 06:59:22.180
Try rephrasing, please

06:59:24.180 --> 06:59:26.180
Don't worry, the scriptmaster has your back

06:59:26.180 --> 06:59:27.180
That's all I'm saying

06:59:27.180 --> 06:59:29.180
He knows the interests of the pinpals

06:59:29.180 --> 06:59:31.180
And we're gonna try our best to...

06:59:32.180 --> 06:59:33.180
Be up at port

06:59:35.180 --> 06:59:36.180
But there you go

06:59:38.180 --> 06:59:40.180
Strani, what if you want to get comfy in bed

06:59:40.180 --> 06:59:41.180
And then get...

06:59:41.180 --> 06:59:42.180
Oh, my God

06:59:42.180 --> 06:59:44.180
Are you seeing that meme that's like

06:59:44.180 --> 06:59:45.180
When you're...

06:59:45.180 --> 06:59:46.180
What's it?

06:59:46.180 --> 06:59:48.180
When your sushi roll is sad

06:59:48.180 --> 06:59:50.180
Just take your sushi roll

06:59:50.180 --> 06:59:51.180
And

06:59:51.180 --> 06:59:53.180
Deer her down

06:59:55.180 --> 06:59:56.180
Base script...

06:59:56.180 --> 06:59:58.180
Bro, the script quality is gonna like

06:59:58.180 --> 06:59:59.180
Go up dramatically

06:59:59.180 --> 07:00:01.180
After the three month mark

07:00:01.180 --> 07:00:03.180
You're gonna know when the scriptmaster came into play

07:00:03.180 --> 07:00:05.180
Because you can tell it's like

07:00:05.180 --> 07:00:07.180
Not me writing that shit anymore

07:00:07.180 --> 07:00:10.180
You're like, oh, God, finally, Strani's not doing it anymore

07:00:11.180 --> 07:00:14.180
I say that as if I'm not writing all my own stuff

07:00:14.180 --> 07:00:16.180
But I want to write my own stuff

07:00:16.180 --> 07:00:17.180
Because I'm passionate about it

07:00:17.180 --> 07:00:20.180
Not to say that scriptmaster isn't passionate

07:00:20.180 --> 07:00:21.180
But I quite like writing my stuff

07:00:21.180 --> 07:00:22.180
Because it feels...

07:00:22.180 --> 07:00:24.180
It feels more intimate

07:00:24.180 --> 07:00:27.180
When I can like do it between me and Beefling, you know

07:00:27.180 --> 07:00:29.180
And we do it together

07:00:29.180 --> 07:00:30.180
And I have you in mind

07:00:30.180 --> 07:00:31.180
You are my muse, Beefling

07:00:31.180 --> 07:00:32.180
You are my muse

07:00:33.180 --> 07:00:35.180
Feed the fire for Mumme

07:00:35.180 --> 07:00:37.180
Thank you

07:00:41.180 --> 07:00:42.180
Oh, that's it

07:00:42.180 --> 07:00:44.180
When your girlfriend is sad

07:00:44.180 --> 07:00:45.180
Lira in a blanket

07:00:45.180 --> 07:00:46.180
A ruler

07:00:46.180 --> 07:00:47.180
Yeah, yeah, yeah

07:00:47.180 --> 07:00:48.180
That's the one

07:00:48.180 --> 07:00:50.180
Sometimes it's nice being a little bro

07:00:50.180 --> 07:00:52.180
Well, little bros are for zero

07:00:52.180 --> 07:00:54.180
Big bros in me

07:00:58.180 --> 07:01:00.180
Yours are exceptionally good

07:01:00.180 --> 07:01:01.180
Aw, that's very kind

07:01:01.180 --> 07:01:03.180
I like...

07:01:03.180 --> 07:01:05.180
I did have the option to hand over

07:01:05.180 --> 07:01:07.180
My scripts to someone else

07:01:07.180 --> 07:01:10.180
But I like doing it between us

07:01:10.180 --> 07:01:12.180
Really need this fire

07:01:12.180 --> 07:01:14.180
Making XP for real, for real

07:01:17.180 --> 07:01:19.180
I imagine you and the other girls

07:01:19.180 --> 07:01:20.180
Write their own stuff

07:01:20.180 --> 07:01:23.180
There was a handful of girls

07:01:23.180 --> 07:01:25.180
Who wanted to give their hand at it

07:01:25.180 --> 07:01:27.180
I absolutely did not expect it

07:01:27.180 --> 07:01:30.180
Because it's just more time

07:01:30.180 --> 07:01:32.180
And I don't want the girls like

07:01:32.180 --> 07:01:34.180
Stressing out over that kind of thing

07:01:37.180 --> 07:01:38.180
But yeah

07:01:41.180 --> 07:01:43.180
I just don't want to stress the girls out

07:01:43.180 --> 07:01:46.180
If they want to do it of their own violation

07:01:46.180 --> 07:01:48.180
Violition? Violition?

07:01:48.180 --> 07:01:50.180
Then that's perfect

07:01:50.180 --> 07:01:52.180
Did I just hear them?

07:01:56.180 --> 07:01:57.180
I guess she's not happy

07:01:57.180 --> 07:01:59.180
I fed her

07:01:59.180 --> 07:02:00.180
Oh well

07:02:02.180 --> 07:02:04.180
Day 10 of eating celery daily

07:02:04.180 --> 07:02:05.180
It's so bad

07:02:05.180 --> 07:02:07.180
Oh no, don't put yourself through

07:02:07.180 --> 07:02:08.180
Celery for that

07:02:08.180 --> 07:02:10.180
Celery is nasty

07:02:10.180 --> 07:02:11.180
I've never enjoyed it

07:02:11.180 --> 07:02:12.180
I'm sorry

07:02:12.180 --> 07:02:14.180
Doesn't matter how much humus

07:02:14.180 --> 07:02:15.180
You put on it

07:02:15.180 --> 07:02:17.180
Violition? Violition?

07:02:17.180 --> 07:02:19.180
Did I just say it funny?

07:02:19.180 --> 07:02:20.180
Volition

07:02:20.180 --> 07:02:21.180
Volition!

07:02:21.180 --> 07:02:22.180
There's no I

07:02:22.180 --> 07:02:23.180
Okay, we're getting there

07:02:23.180 --> 07:02:25.180
Stopped to fluster us

07:02:25.180 --> 07:02:26.180
Exactly

07:02:29.180 --> 07:02:30.180
Oh my goodness

07:02:31.180 --> 07:02:32.180
Violation

07:02:32.180 --> 07:02:34.180
Oh no, now you're getting me confused

07:02:35.180 --> 07:02:37.180
Yeah, I love your scripts

07:02:37.180 --> 07:02:38.180
On Patreon Strony

07:02:38.180 --> 07:02:40.180
Thank you!

07:02:40.180 --> 07:02:43.180
I did them off the top of my head myself

07:02:47.180 --> 07:02:49.180
I'll be very curious to see

07:02:49.180 --> 07:02:51.180
What the donathon results in

07:02:51.180 --> 07:02:52.180
I have

07:02:52.180 --> 07:02:56.180
I imagine the week after the donathon concludes

07:02:56.180 --> 07:02:58.180
I will be having very short streams

07:02:58.180 --> 07:03:01.180
So I can focus on the rewards one at a time

07:03:01.180 --> 07:03:05.180
I know some agencies had a bit of problems

07:03:05.180 --> 07:03:08.180
Trying to handle streaming and getting rewards out

07:03:08.180 --> 07:03:12.180
Obviously, because I'm such an unbelievable

07:03:12.180 --> 07:03:15.180
Bad workaholic or good however you want to

07:03:15.180 --> 07:03:18.180
Good for people who like content, content, content

07:03:18.180 --> 07:03:22.180
Bad for the actual workaholic themselves

07:03:22.180 --> 07:03:24.180
Because they just non-stop keep going

07:03:24.180 --> 07:03:28.180
But I think I definitely am in a position where

07:03:28.180 --> 07:03:31.180
I can get stuff out relatively quick

07:03:31.180 --> 07:03:35.180
Whether that be an audio, a collab audio

07:03:37.180 --> 07:03:38.180
Yeah

07:03:39.180 --> 07:03:41.180
Maybe those are good if you want your money from birds

07:03:41.180 --> 07:03:46.180
I have a huge backlog of willow logs from doing forest streams

07:03:46.180 --> 07:03:48.180
Short streams, like 10 hours instead of 12

07:03:50.180 --> 07:03:53.180
For me, a short stream is 2 hours

07:03:53.180 --> 07:03:54.180
Which I think someone said

07:03:54.180 --> 07:03:56.180
That's literally what the regular stream time is

07:03:56.180 --> 07:03:58.180
For the average YouTuber

07:03:58.180 --> 07:03:59.180
And I'm like

07:04:00.180 --> 07:04:03.180
2 hours is me doing stuff in the background

07:04:03.180 --> 07:04:05.180
I'm not being funny

07:04:07.180 --> 07:04:09.180
If you look and you see I've done a 2 hour stream

07:04:09.180 --> 07:04:10.180
And nothing else that day

07:04:10.180 --> 07:04:13.180
That means I am doing so much work in the background

07:04:14.180 --> 07:04:15.180
Type thing

07:04:16.180 --> 07:04:18.180
Is that these strony culls?

07:04:19.180 --> 07:04:21.180
There's only one of them in this world baby

07:04:23.180 --> 07:04:25.180
Time to cook through my 3k swordfish

07:04:25.180 --> 07:04:28.180
Literally that's what I'm doing

07:04:28.180 --> 07:04:29.180
Just getting through it

07:04:30.180 --> 07:04:34.180
It takes her 2 hours just to start playing the lamo

07:04:37.180 --> 07:04:38.180
Management got me there

07:04:38.180 --> 07:04:39.180
Hydration check

07:04:46.180 --> 07:04:47.180
Hi strony

07:04:47.180 --> 07:04:48.180
In the most loving way possible

07:04:48.180 --> 07:04:51.180
I want to bury my face in your butt until you pass out

07:04:51.180 --> 07:04:53.180
While you hmmm yourself

07:04:53.180 --> 07:04:54.180
You're too hot

07:04:56.180 --> 07:04:59.180
Just your gentle talk is enough to get me going sometimes

07:04:59.180 --> 07:05:00.180
When you talk about other hot things

07:05:00.180 --> 07:05:02.180
I need a moment to calm down

07:05:02.180 --> 07:05:03.180
Oh my god Rythme

07:05:04.180 --> 07:05:06.180
Got me blushing and shit

07:05:06.180 --> 07:05:07.180
Stop

07:05:08.180 --> 07:05:10.180
I'm glad I have that control of you

07:05:11.180 --> 07:05:12.180
That power

07:05:13.180 --> 07:05:15.180
Makes me very happy

07:05:17.180 --> 07:05:18.180
I'm a bit too happy

07:05:18.180 --> 07:05:20.180
I think I take a little bit too much

07:05:21.180 --> 07:05:23.180
Pleasure from such a thing

07:05:23.180 --> 07:05:25.180
Is that terrible?

07:05:29.180 --> 07:05:31.180
I'm sure do have powers

07:05:31.180 --> 07:05:32.180
Terrorist to boot up

07:05:32.180 --> 07:05:33.180
What is this a Windows 95?

07:05:33.180 --> 07:05:35.180
No cause I want to stop yapping

07:05:38.180 --> 07:05:39.180
I love to eat sushi

07:05:39.180 --> 07:05:41.180
I could do it for hours

07:05:41.180 --> 07:05:42.180
Oh yeah

07:05:44.180 --> 07:05:45.180
Is that because I'm a cutlery?

07:05:47.180 --> 07:05:50.180
Oh I keep wanting to freakin make that

07:05:50.180 --> 07:05:52.180
What does your Oshii smell like meme?

07:05:53.180 --> 07:05:54.180
Because

07:05:55.180 --> 07:05:57.180
The reason is

07:05:59.180 --> 07:06:00.180
What's the reason?

07:06:01.180 --> 07:06:04.180
Oh because I use a lemon scented soap

07:06:04.180 --> 07:06:06.180
I wanted to post it and be like

07:06:06.180 --> 07:06:08.180
This cutlery comes pre-seasoned

07:06:09.180 --> 07:06:12.180
And then I think there's only one other girl that needs to do it

07:06:12.180 --> 07:06:15.180
And then everyone knows what the whole revealer smells like

07:06:16.180 --> 07:06:18.180
6,000 subscribers reached

07:06:19.180 --> 07:06:20.180
What?

07:06:20.180 --> 07:06:22.180
We celebrated 5k

07:06:25.180 --> 07:06:27.180
Oh my gosh

07:06:27.180 --> 07:06:28.180
Fish

07:06:34.180 --> 07:06:35.180
Ah

07:06:44.180 --> 07:06:45.180
What?

07:06:47.180 --> 07:06:49.180
I'm really excited

07:06:58.180 --> 07:07:03.180
Why is it getting so hot?

07:07:04.180 --> 07:07:06.180
I'm so confused

07:07:06.180 --> 07:07:08.180
It shouldn't have been

07:07:08.180 --> 07:07:10.180
Statistically yet

07:07:10.180 --> 07:07:13.180
It should have only been pushed to 5k people

07:07:13.180 --> 07:07:14.180
It's bizarre

07:07:14.180 --> 07:07:16.180
I didn't expect that at all

07:07:16.180 --> 07:07:18.180
Are you squiddling me right now?

07:07:18.180 --> 07:07:19.180
Yeah

07:07:24.180 --> 07:07:26.180
Thank you for the tip

07:07:26.180 --> 07:07:28.180
Milk Cadmus

07:07:29.180 --> 07:07:31.180
Any milk cadmets?

07:07:31.180 --> 07:07:33.180
Thank you for saying it

07:07:33.180 --> 07:07:34.180
I'm so confused

07:07:34.180 --> 07:07:36.180
I'm like daddy you make a tweet and be like

07:07:36.180 --> 07:07:38.180
I can't believe it but under 24 hours

07:07:40.180 --> 07:07:43.180
The one thing, I've mentioned this in another stream

07:07:43.180 --> 07:07:48.180
The one thing I do not like about being a VTuber in this context

07:07:48.180 --> 07:07:51.180
Is you have to play the numbered games

07:07:51.180 --> 07:07:53.180
And you have to play the

07:07:53.180 --> 07:07:56.180
Oh thank you for this

07:07:58.180 --> 07:08:01.180
In terms of milestones

07:08:02.180 --> 07:08:05.180
And it's a hard one to navigate

07:08:05.180 --> 07:08:08.180
Because if you don't say thank you thank you

07:08:08.180 --> 07:08:11.180
You look almost ungrateful

07:08:11.180 --> 07:08:14.180
But if you do say thank you thank you

07:08:14.180 --> 07:08:17.180
It looks like you're counting and waiting for the next milestone

07:08:17.180 --> 07:08:19.180
Just so you can spam thank you thank you

07:08:20.180 --> 07:08:23.180
You don't have to say thank you

07:08:23.180 --> 07:08:25.180
Well the problem is

07:08:25.180 --> 07:08:28.180
I'm trying to get like

07:08:28.180 --> 07:08:30.180
Gratis on 6k a moment

07:08:30.180 --> 07:08:32.180
Thank you Luthe Reefling

07:08:33.180 --> 07:08:34.180
The thing is

07:08:34.180 --> 07:08:37.180
It would be really good to get on VTuber news

07:08:37.180 --> 07:08:39.180
Or any kind of source like that

07:08:39.180 --> 07:08:42.180
Because it brings more attention to the girls in general

07:08:43.180 --> 07:08:46.180
Which is why it's like

07:08:47.180 --> 07:08:50.180
I don't want people thinking I'm counting

07:08:50.180 --> 07:08:55.180
But what I'm thinking about is the probability

07:08:55.180 --> 07:08:58.180
That it could gain new eyes to the girls

07:08:58.180 --> 07:09:00.180
Because I want nothing for them to succeed

07:09:00.180 --> 07:09:02.180
I've got everything I want right here

07:09:02.180 --> 07:09:03.180
I've got my Reeflings

07:09:03.180 --> 07:09:04.180
We're freaking meman

07:09:04.180 --> 07:09:06.180
We've got member streams

07:09:06.180 --> 07:09:07.180
We've got multiplayer games

07:09:07.180 --> 07:09:09.180
We've got ASMR

07:09:09.180 --> 07:09:10.180
The Wazoo coming out

07:09:10.180 --> 07:09:11.180
I've got collabs of other VTubers

07:09:11.180 --> 07:09:13.180
That are willing to interact with me

07:09:13.180 --> 07:09:15.180
Like I've got everything I need

07:09:15.180 --> 07:09:17.180
I'm so freaking happy

07:09:17.180 --> 07:09:20.180
I want the girls to achieve their dreams

07:09:20.180 --> 07:09:23.180
And the truth of them achieving their dreams

07:09:23.180 --> 07:09:25.180
Is one to have enough money to be a content creator

07:09:25.180 --> 07:09:27.180
Some of them are looking to move out

07:09:27.180 --> 07:09:30.180
Some of them are looking for upgrade equipments on their own

07:09:32.180 --> 07:09:34.180
You know, Emmie was fantastic

07:09:34.180 --> 07:09:36.180
She's already designed her 2.0 model

07:09:36.180 --> 07:09:38.180
Because it feels more like her

07:09:39.180 --> 07:09:41.180
That kind of thing

07:09:41.180 --> 07:09:42.180
I want the girls to have it

07:09:42.180 --> 07:09:44.180
Some of them wanted 3D models

07:09:44.180 --> 07:09:46.180
I wanted them to get it

07:09:46.180 --> 07:09:49.180
And the truth of the matter is

07:09:49.180 --> 07:09:51.180
In order to get these things

07:09:51.180 --> 07:09:54.180
There needs to be eyes on the girls

07:09:54.180 --> 07:09:59.180
So I can help them achieve their 3D goals and stuff

07:09:59.180 --> 07:10:00.180
Although someone said that

07:10:00.180 --> 07:10:03.180
Someone was like, what do you mean by the 3 year mark?

07:10:03.180 --> 07:10:07.180
Whenever I mention the 3 year mark

07:10:07.180 --> 07:10:09.180
Congrats to whoever leveled up there

07:10:09.180 --> 07:10:12.180
Whenever I mention the 3 year mark

07:10:12.180 --> 07:10:14.180
The reason I say 3 years

07:10:14.180 --> 07:10:17.180
Is because statistically 3 years

07:10:17.180 --> 07:10:19.180
And you're done

07:10:19.180 --> 07:10:22.180
You're persona, you're whatever you want to call it

07:10:22.180 --> 07:10:23.180
Emmie Bezos

07:10:23.180 --> 07:10:26.180
Oh my god, you really look like Emmie as well in games

07:10:28.180 --> 07:10:33.180
The reason why 3 years is this mysterious number

07:10:33.180 --> 07:10:34.180
Placed on someone's head

07:10:34.180 --> 07:10:36.180
Is because that statistically

07:10:36.180 --> 07:10:38.180
If you do find success

07:10:38.180 --> 07:10:40.180
By the third year

07:10:40.180 --> 07:10:43.180
The success goes unless you make

07:10:43.180 --> 07:10:46.180
You change your content up dramatically

07:10:46.180 --> 07:10:48.180
And the reason I say 3 years

07:10:48.180 --> 07:10:50.180
Is because

07:10:50.180 --> 07:10:52.180
Before you're like wait

07:10:52.180 --> 07:10:53.180
So Strongie's only got 3 years

07:10:53.180 --> 07:10:55.180
Relax, stop doing it

07:10:55.180 --> 07:10:58.180
Relax, no

07:10:58.180 --> 07:11:00.180
No, that's not

07:11:00.180 --> 07:11:04.180
It's very possible that Strongie and

07:11:04.180 --> 07:11:06.180
Like once we're all satisfied

07:11:06.180 --> 07:11:09.180
Like I won't stop until you guys are ready for me to stop

07:11:09.180 --> 07:11:10.180
Like please don't

07:11:10.180 --> 07:11:11.180
No, don't do it

07:11:11.180 --> 07:11:14.180
But please don't think I'm just going to abruptly stop

07:11:14.180 --> 07:11:15.180
Overnight

07:11:15.180 --> 07:11:18.180
Like that's not the reality of the situation at all

07:11:18.180 --> 07:11:20.180
It's very likely

07:11:20.180 --> 07:11:23.180
I will want to focus on hypnosis

07:11:23.180 --> 07:11:26.180
Audio is like way down the line

07:11:26.180 --> 07:11:28.180
It's over

07:11:28.180 --> 07:11:29.180
No, so never

07:11:29.180 --> 07:11:30.180
No, if you don't want me to go

07:11:30.180 --> 07:11:33.180
I'll be streaming in my little retirement home

07:11:33.180 --> 07:11:35.180
Doing my thing

07:11:35.180 --> 07:11:38.180
I've got an end in stamina

07:11:38.180 --> 07:11:41.180
Like seriously this is

07:11:41.180 --> 07:11:45.180
Just it took so long to get here

07:11:45.180 --> 07:11:47.180
And everything worked out in the end

07:11:47.180 --> 07:11:51.180
And it just feels so nice to be

07:11:51.180 --> 07:11:54.180
I don't know, I just

07:11:54.180 --> 07:11:57.180
Like to be accepted

07:11:57.180 --> 07:11:59.180
To be just having fun

07:11:59.180 --> 07:12:01.180
Folk want to hang out

07:12:01.180 --> 07:12:02.180
It's just casual

07:12:02.180 --> 07:12:04.180
It's none of this like

07:12:04.180 --> 07:12:06.180
You know

07:12:06.180 --> 07:12:08.180
Art say fart say like

07:12:08.180 --> 07:12:12.180
Oh this VTuber is giggling their head off every two seconds

07:12:12.180 --> 07:12:14.180
And this VTuber is like

07:12:14.180 --> 07:12:15.180
Putting on this like

07:12:15.180 --> 07:12:17.180
Horrifically fake personality

07:12:17.180 --> 07:12:20.180
Pina, thank you for becoming a member

07:12:20.180 --> 07:12:23.180
The first year is an introduction

07:12:23.180 --> 07:12:26.180
The second is establishing and third is plateau

07:12:26.180 --> 07:12:28.180
That is quite literally what it is

07:12:28.180 --> 07:12:31.180
That is what most people experience

07:12:31.180 --> 07:12:33.180
If you've ever been like

07:12:33.180 --> 07:12:37.180
Why did that one in the VTuber

07:12:37.180 --> 07:12:41.180
Go on a new account

07:12:41.180 --> 07:12:44.180
That's basically remaking a persona

07:12:44.180 --> 07:12:46.180
Because you plateau

07:12:46.180 --> 07:12:48.180
And it's perfectly natural to plateau

07:12:48.180 --> 07:12:51.180
There's no issue

07:12:51.180 --> 07:12:53.180
Only 155 more

07:12:55.180 --> 07:12:58.180
Thank you Peter Everingham

07:12:58.180 --> 07:13:00.180
For becoming a member

07:13:00.180 --> 07:13:01.180
I appreciate it

07:13:01.180 --> 07:13:03.180
I'll be honest with you all for a sec

07:13:03.180 --> 07:13:05.180
Let's see what's up

07:13:05.180 --> 07:13:07.180
Question mark

07:13:07.180 --> 07:13:09.180
What's up

07:13:09.180 --> 07:13:12.180
Or does this refling share with us

07:13:12.180 --> 07:13:14.180
We will

07:13:14.180 --> 07:13:16.180
Strony until we die at 99

07:13:16.180 --> 07:13:18.180
Because it's part of our little heart

07:13:18.180 --> 07:13:19.180
I fart

07:13:19.180 --> 07:13:21.180
Okay you're done refling

07:13:22.180 --> 07:13:24.180
Deeply departed

07:13:24.180 --> 07:13:26.180
He came and he farted

07:13:27.180 --> 07:13:31.180
Damn you and people can't just do the same thing successfully

07:13:31.180 --> 07:13:34.180
Without ever needing any variation in their content

07:13:34.180 --> 07:13:36.180
I haven't seen examples of that before

07:13:36.180 --> 07:13:37.180
Yes

07:13:37.180 --> 07:13:40.180
I really like the behind the scenes psychology

07:13:40.180 --> 07:13:42.180
About it all

07:13:42.180 --> 07:13:44.180
Monster girls

07:13:44.180 --> 07:13:45.180
Please

07:13:45.180 --> 07:13:47.180
Thank you for becoming a member

07:13:47.180 --> 07:13:50.180
Is that you asking for gen 2 designs to be monster girls

07:13:50.180 --> 07:13:53.180
Oh boy you're in for a treat

07:13:53.180 --> 07:13:55.180
Um

07:13:55.180 --> 07:13:57.180
Yeah

07:13:57.180 --> 07:14:01.180
There's been 2 designs that have been accepted

07:14:01.180 --> 07:14:03.180
Lololololol

07:14:03.180 --> 07:14:05.180
Um

07:14:05.180 --> 07:14:08.180
Mods take some of his pennies

07:14:08.180 --> 07:14:10.180
And scatter them across his home

07:14:10.180 --> 07:14:12.180
Wait that's so specific

07:14:13.180 --> 07:14:15.180
Oh I don't know

07:14:15.180 --> 07:14:18.180
I feel like you feel happy streaming

07:14:18.180 --> 07:14:20.180
I can see that

07:14:20.180 --> 07:14:22.180
I can't imagine mome

07:14:22.180 --> 07:14:24.180
Without this

07:14:24.180 --> 07:14:26.180
There was obviously

07:14:26.180 --> 07:14:29.180
Right actually I can tell you something behind the scenes

07:14:29.180 --> 07:14:32.180
And you're not gonna like it but it's no longer the case

07:14:32.180 --> 07:14:34.180
Because I got script manager in

07:14:34.180 --> 07:14:36.180
If and when gen 2 came around

07:14:36.180 --> 07:14:39.180
There was no way I could keep up with the daily streaming

07:14:39.180 --> 07:14:42.180
And trying to organize all the script stuff

07:14:42.180 --> 07:14:44.180
Um

07:14:44.180 --> 07:14:47.180
But thank you to script master for coming into play

07:14:47.180 --> 07:14:49.180
Because without them

07:14:49.180 --> 07:14:51.180
Being there

07:14:51.180 --> 07:14:53.180
With gen 2 starting

07:14:53.180 --> 07:14:55.180
I probably couldn't daily stream

07:14:55.180 --> 07:14:57.180
So

07:14:57.180 --> 07:14:59.180
That's the honest truth

07:14:59.180 --> 07:15:01.180
I was gonna stream my ass off for an entire year

07:15:01.180 --> 07:15:03.180
Like non-stop back to back double streams

07:15:03.180 --> 07:15:05.180
On some days doing like endurance this

07:15:05.180 --> 07:15:07.180
Endurance that

07:15:07.180 --> 07:15:09.180
But thankfully that's no longer the case

07:15:09.180 --> 07:15:11.180
Um

07:15:11.180 --> 07:15:13.180
Obviously

07:15:13.180 --> 07:15:15.180
When

07:15:15.180 --> 07:15:17.180
Gen 3 were to occur

07:15:17.180 --> 07:15:19.180
That's a lot

07:15:19.180 --> 07:15:21.180
Of girls to manage

07:15:21.180 --> 07:15:23.180
And I'm not sure how realistic the daily streams

07:15:23.180 --> 07:15:25.180
Will be at that point

07:15:25.180 --> 07:15:27.180
Is my only concern

07:15:27.180 --> 07:15:29.180
And the thing is none of us have a crystal ball

07:15:29.180 --> 07:15:31.180
To look into the future

07:15:31.180 --> 07:15:33.180
So I can't tell

07:15:33.180 --> 07:15:35.180
By 0 by 0

07:15:35.180 --> 07:15:37.180
By 0 every day is a blessing

07:15:37.180 --> 07:15:39.180
No don't cry don't do him don't do him

07:15:39.180 --> 07:15:41.180
We're not even there we've not even

07:15:41.180 --> 07:15:43.180
We've not even got the first model of gen 2

07:15:43.180 --> 07:15:45.180
Literally we have fucking 2 approved concepts

07:15:45.180 --> 07:15:47.180
That's the

07:15:47.180 --> 07:15:49.180
Don't burn out in spite

07:15:49.180 --> 07:15:51.180
See that's the thing spite can get you very far

07:15:51.180 --> 07:15:53.180
Maybe I will

07:15:53.180 --> 07:15:55.180
Spite everyone and just say

07:15:55.180 --> 07:15:57.180
I'll stream daily and you guys weren't ready for it

07:15:57.180 --> 07:15:59.180
It's so jovert nyo

07:15:59.180 --> 07:16:01.180
Less than 6kxp

07:16:01.180 --> 07:16:03.180
For 80 million hp

07:16:03.180 --> 07:16:05.180
And I'm just chillin here

07:16:05.180 --> 07:16:07.180
Banned from shame

07:16:07.180 --> 07:16:09.180
Braptuber allegations have not been been

07:16:09.180 --> 07:16:11.180
No

07:16:11.180 --> 07:16:13.180
The future in the game background is making me feel more

07:16:13.180 --> 07:16:15.180
Okay no no no happy thoughts

07:16:15.180 --> 07:16:17.180
Happy thoughts

07:16:19.180 --> 07:16:21.180
If you can do this

07:16:21.180 --> 07:16:23.180
In not even 2 weeks

07:16:23.180 --> 07:16:25.180
I can't imagine what you're gonna do in a year

07:16:25.180 --> 07:16:27.180
I mean

07:16:27.180 --> 07:16:29.180
It's not really gonna change

07:16:29.180 --> 07:16:31.180
Sorry

07:16:31.180 --> 07:16:33.180
This is

07:16:33.180 --> 07:16:35.180
Me having happy times

07:16:35.180 --> 07:16:37.180
We do have some monthly events planned

07:16:37.180 --> 07:16:39.180
Um

07:16:39.180 --> 07:16:41.180
Type things

07:16:41.180 --> 07:16:43.180
Going on got ASMR collabs planned

07:16:43.180 --> 07:16:45.180
I think ASMR is like a bread and butter

07:16:45.180 --> 07:16:47.180
Please

07:16:47.180 --> 07:16:49.180
Please consider ASMR

07:16:49.180 --> 07:16:51.180
As a bread and butter viewer

07:16:51.180 --> 07:16:53.180
Some people kinda get annoyed when ASMR

07:16:53.180 --> 07:16:55.180
At ASMR

07:16:55.180 --> 07:16:57.180
VTubers dabble

07:16:57.180 --> 07:16:59.180
In ASMR and don't always like commit to it

07:16:59.180 --> 07:17:01.180
Fully but no it's bread and butter

07:17:01.180 --> 07:17:03.180
I think everyone's gonna be participating in it

07:17:03.180 --> 07:17:05.180
Juicily

07:17:05.180 --> 07:17:07.180
Can you spit on us

07:17:07.180 --> 07:17:09.180
Yeah you want me to spit all over your face

07:17:11.180 --> 07:17:13.180
Open it

07:17:13.180 --> 07:17:15.180
Open your mouth

07:17:15.180 --> 07:17:17.180
Let me spit on your face

07:17:17.180 --> 07:17:19.180
Um

07:17:19.180 --> 07:17:21.180
Yeah don't

07:17:21.180 --> 07:17:23.180
Don't worry like

07:17:23.180 --> 07:17:25.180
Ah frickin you know how open and honest

07:17:25.180 --> 07:17:27.180
I'm gonna tell you what it looks like

07:17:27.180 --> 07:17:29.180
And what things are like and you know

07:17:29.180 --> 07:17:31.180
People who do watch you can get little

07:17:31.180 --> 07:17:33.180
Tip bits of information

07:17:33.180 --> 07:17:35.180
Early access information

07:17:35.180 --> 07:17:37.180
VTubers ASMR

07:17:37.180 --> 07:17:39.180
Finally someone combined two of my favourite things

07:17:39.180 --> 07:17:41.180
Well I actually got a lot of feedback

07:17:41.180 --> 07:17:43.180
Where people were like

07:17:43.180 --> 07:17:45.180
I am so tired of like VTubers

07:17:45.180 --> 07:17:47.180
Blue bowling

07:17:47.180 --> 07:17:49.180
And they'll participate in something

07:17:49.180 --> 07:17:51.180
And then withdraw

07:17:51.180 --> 07:17:53.180
And

07:17:53.180 --> 07:17:55.180
Because they never really had a thing for it

07:17:55.180 --> 07:17:57.180
And I was like oh my goodness

07:17:57.180 --> 07:17:59.180
Aren't we hitting the

07:17:59.180 --> 07:18:01.180
Hammer on the head with a nail

07:18:01.180 --> 07:18:03.180
And the nail on the head with a hammer

07:18:03.180 --> 07:18:05.180
Wait other way around

07:18:05.180 --> 07:18:07.180
Finally hitting the nail on the head with a hammer

07:18:09.180 --> 07:18:11.180
Because

07:18:11.180 --> 07:18:13.180
It's quite literally

07:18:13.180 --> 07:18:15.180
Like all of us are completely fine

07:18:15.180 --> 07:18:17.180
Thankfully things are coming

07:18:17.180 --> 07:18:19.180
A member

07:18:27.180 --> 07:18:29.180
No refling

07:18:29.180 --> 07:18:31.180
For the tip

07:18:31.180 --> 07:18:33.180
No I'm not freaking leaving

07:18:33.180 --> 07:18:35.180
Like I'll tell you the plan

07:18:35.180 --> 07:18:37.180
I'll always tell you the plan

07:18:37.180 --> 07:18:39.180
What the deal is

07:18:39.180 --> 07:18:41.180
Like when have I freaking

07:18:41.180 --> 07:18:43.180
I mean I'm only hitting like what

07:18:43.180 --> 07:18:45.180
NDA content

07:18:45.180 --> 07:18:47.180
Even then what NDA content

07:18:47.180 --> 07:18:49.180
Have I got left behind at this point

07:18:51.180 --> 07:18:53.180
Oh a hydration

07:18:53.180 --> 07:18:55.180
I'm gonna have to drink some water

07:18:55.180 --> 07:18:57.180
Need some water

07:18:57.180 --> 07:18:59.180
Water from my bottle of water

07:19:07.180 --> 07:19:09.180
The farm is the real plan trust

07:19:09.180 --> 07:19:11.180
Trust in the farm

07:19:11.180 --> 07:19:13.180
Someone says where should I eat

07:19:15.180 --> 07:19:17.180
I'm getting Mexican

07:19:17.180 --> 07:19:19.180
I've ordered it

07:19:19.180 --> 07:19:21.180
Hold on let me check

07:19:21.180 --> 07:19:23.180
Let me check where my Mexican food is

07:19:23.180 --> 07:19:25.180
Hmm

07:19:25.180 --> 07:19:27.180
And before it's sitting outside

07:19:27.180 --> 07:19:29.180
Oh wait hold on

07:19:37.180 --> 07:19:39.180
Wait scriptmasters asking

07:19:39.180 --> 07:19:41.180
What are you even

07:19:41.180 --> 07:19:43.180
So the sentence mom says I'm in charge

07:19:43.180 --> 07:19:45.180
Is way over the lane

07:19:45.180 --> 07:19:47.180
Yuck

07:19:47.180 --> 07:19:49.180
Yes

07:19:49.180 --> 07:19:51.180
Because that implies

07:19:51.180 --> 07:19:53.180
Sorry you guys are getting correction

07:19:53.180 --> 07:19:55.180
Yes come on please

07:19:57.180 --> 07:19:59.180
Okay there we go sorry scriptmasters

07:19:59.180 --> 07:20:01.180
Trying to really help out the pinpals here

07:20:05.180 --> 07:20:07.180
I'm trying to tell them like

07:20:07.180 --> 07:20:09.180
You need to skirt the patreon to yours

07:20:09.180 --> 07:20:11.180
I don't know

07:20:11.180 --> 07:20:13.180
Boring inside yourself

07:20:13.180 --> 07:20:15.180
Okay

07:20:15.180 --> 07:20:17.180
We will have a castle

07:20:17.180 --> 07:20:19.180
And I'm gonna let it out a little cafe

07:20:21.180 --> 07:20:23.180
Okay

07:20:23.180 --> 07:20:25.180
That sounds like a scary

07:20:25.180 --> 07:20:27.180
Oh a spicy script

07:20:27.180 --> 07:20:29.180
Very much so

07:20:29.180 --> 07:20:31.180
Azura's four part series

07:20:31.180 --> 07:20:33.180
Got finished main

07:20:33.180 --> 07:20:35.180
My four part series is now gonna be

07:20:35.180 --> 07:20:37.180
On Twitter for free because

07:20:37.180 --> 07:20:39.180
It's not allowed

07:20:39.180 --> 07:20:41.180
So I'll need to think of another four part series

07:20:41.180 --> 07:20:43.180
Maybe

07:20:43.180 --> 07:20:45.180
He's feeling a cheeky Chinese

07:20:45.180 --> 07:20:47.180
Takeout honestly

07:20:47.180 --> 07:20:49.180
Chinese and Australia is amazing

07:20:49.180 --> 07:20:51.180
It's so good

07:20:51.180 --> 07:20:53.180

07:20:53.180 --> 07:20:55.180
Bye bye I have to sleep

07:20:55.180 --> 07:20:57.180
Have an ice stream

07:20:57.180 --> 07:20:59.180
Thank you so much

07:20:59.180 --> 07:21:01.180
For anyone who needs to sleep

07:21:01.180 --> 07:21:03.180
Or I need to get a few things done around

07:21:03.180 --> 07:21:05.180
The house

07:21:05.180 --> 07:21:07.180
Or you need to get some water in you

07:21:07.180 --> 07:21:09.180
Please don't be afraid to go do so

07:21:09.180 --> 07:21:11.180
Keep yourself as healthy as possible

07:21:11.180 --> 07:21:13.180
A succulent Chinese meal

07:21:15.180 --> 07:21:17.180
Oh I should do a Scottish dub of that

07:21:17.180 --> 07:21:19.180
What have I done wrong

07:21:19.180 --> 07:21:21.180
Just enjoying a meal

07:21:21.180 --> 07:21:23.180
A succulent Chinese meal

07:21:25.180 --> 07:21:27.180
Dubbing

07:21:27.180 --> 07:21:29.180
Dubbing memes

07:21:29.180 --> 07:21:31.180
But I'm Scottish

07:21:31.180 --> 07:21:33.180
Video

07:21:33.180 --> 07:21:35.180
Honestly

07:21:35.180 --> 07:21:37.180
Maybe that would work out

07:21:37.180 --> 07:21:39.180
I feel like that's got potential

07:21:39.180 --> 07:21:41.180
A wee bit of potential not too much

07:21:41.180 --> 07:21:43.180
Get your hands off

07:21:43.180 --> 07:21:45.180

07:21:59.180 --> 07:22:01.180
A little funny ha ha series

07:22:03.180 --> 07:22:05.180
I can go there

07:22:05.180 --> 07:22:07.180
Unhand my hose

07:22:07.180 --> 07:22:09.180
Hell nah

07:22:09.180 --> 07:22:11.180
I've got to stay and see the end of the day

07:22:11.180 --> 07:22:13.180
That'll be AAM

07:22:13.180 --> 07:22:15.180
That's so unhealthy though

07:22:15.180 --> 07:22:17.180
You should sleep

07:22:17.180 --> 07:22:19.180
Only I can do such endurance things

07:22:19.180 --> 07:22:21.180
Cause I'm a big girl

07:22:21.180 --> 07:22:23.180
If there's anyone lurking

07:22:23.180 --> 07:22:25.180
Who is perishing

07:22:25.180 --> 07:22:27.180
Azuriduli is on

07:22:27.180 --> 07:22:29.180
Stray

07:22:29.180 --> 07:22:31.180
Azuriduli is playing Stray

07:22:31.180 --> 07:22:33.180
And Mercy Modest

07:22:33.180 --> 07:22:35.180
Is playing Harvester part 2

07:22:37.180 --> 07:22:39.180
Azuriduli is live

07:22:39.180 --> 07:22:41.180
Mercy is live in T-minus

07:22:41.180 --> 07:22:43.180
1 hour 30

07:22:43.180 --> 07:22:45.180
I repeat in T-minus 1 hour 30

07:22:45.180 --> 07:22:47.180
Modi

07:22:47.180 --> 07:22:49.180

07:22:51.180 --> 07:22:53.180
Wow someone levelled up

07:22:53.180 --> 07:22:55.180
Congrats

07:22:55.180 --> 07:22:57.180
Ah

07:22:57.180 --> 07:22:59.180
I see you know judo well

07:22:59.180 --> 07:23:01.180
And you are ready to receive my

07:23:01.180 --> 07:23:03.180
Limp

07:23:03.180 --> 07:23:05.180
Just like the blue

07:23:05.180 --> 07:23:07.180
Scottish Power Ranger

07:23:07.180 --> 07:23:09.180
Honestly

07:23:09.180 --> 07:23:11.180
Pick the memes right

07:23:11.180 --> 07:23:13.180
And it's probably got a lot of potential

07:23:13.180 --> 07:23:15.180
I thought about doing like

07:23:15.180 --> 07:23:17.180
Reading the most bizarre

07:23:17.180 --> 07:23:19.180
Reddit stories

07:23:19.180 --> 07:23:21.180
Cause there's a really famous one

07:23:21.180 --> 07:23:23.180
Where this guy broke both his arms

07:23:23.180 --> 07:23:25.180
But I can't say the rest of it

07:23:25.180 --> 07:23:27.180
But I wanted to read it

07:23:27.180 --> 07:23:29.180
Cause I thought it was alright

07:23:29.180 --> 07:23:31.180
But I'm not sure it would work out

07:23:31.180 --> 07:23:33.180
Maybe it would be like a twitter series

07:23:33.180 --> 07:23:35.180
I guess

07:23:35.180 --> 07:23:37.180
I'll be like oh go subscribe to my youtube

07:23:37.180 --> 07:23:39.180
My youtube

07:23:43.180 --> 07:23:45.180
Time for work unfortunately

07:23:45.180 --> 07:23:47.180
Have a good stream

07:23:47.180 --> 07:23:49.180
No you have a good work day

07:23:49.180 --> 07:23:51.180
How dare you

07:23:51.180 --> 07:23:53.180
Please remember to hydrate and look after yourself

07:23:53.180 --> 07:23:55.180
And remember

07:23:55.180 --> 07:23:57.180
Boss makes a dollar

07:23:57.180 --> 07:23:59.180
You make a dime

07:23:59.180 --> 07:24:01.180
That's why you take a big job beyond company

07:24:01.180 --> 07:24:03.180
time

07:24:03.180 --> 07:24:05.180
Please make sure that any stress levels

07:24:05.180 --> 07:24:07.180
Are

07:24:07.180 --> 07:24:09.180
At your pay grade

07:24:09.180 --> 07:24:11.180
If you get paid minimum wage

07:24:11.180 --> 07:24:13.180
That's not your problem

07:24:13.180 --> 07:24:15.180
Should have paid you more

07:24:15.180 --> 07:24:17.180
To care more

07:24:17.180 --> 07:24:19.180
Damn

The arm where he gets some help

07:24:25.180 --> 07:24:27.180
Read the number 15

07:24:35.180 --> 07:24:37.180
I bought blue bed

07:24:37.180 --> 07:24:39.180
Burger king foot lettuce

07:24:43.180 --> 07:24:45.180
I've already forgotten the freaking

07:24:45.180 --> 07:24:47.180
What the frick I just said the B version of the meme

07:24:47.180 --> 07:24:49.180
Burger king foot lettuce

07:24:49.180 --> 07:24:51.180
That's the thing you want in your burger king

07:24:53.180 --> 07:24:55.180
Burger king

07:24:55.180 --> 07:24:57.180
Boot lettuce

07:24:57.180 --> 07:24:59.180
Oh my god what

07:24:59.180 --> 07:25:01.180
Do a 5 part audio where you're getting paid

07:25:01.180 --> 07:25:03.180
Prego we each door

07:25:03.180 --> 07:25:05.180
How would I do that though

07:25:05.180 --> 07:25:07.180
Oh yeah give me a broken

07:25:09.180 --> 07:25:11.180
Oh no

07:25:11.180 --> 07:25:13.180
That's not gonna work

07:25:13.180 --> 07:25:15.180
Maker ginger

07:25:15.180 --> 07:25:17.180
Maker blue hair but no

07:25:17.180 --> 07:25:19.180
What

07:25:19.180 --> 07:25:21.180
We can't make that

07:25:21.180 --> 07:25:23.180
I've got a sea queen

07:25:23.180 --> 07:25:25.180
Audio coming out

07:25:25.180 --> 07:25:27.180
Where I share you

07:25:27.180 --> 07:25:29.180
With all my daughters

07:25:29.180 --> 07:25:31.180
And

07:25:31.180 --> 07:25:33.180
I always take a hmm first thing

07:25:33.180 --> 07:25:35.180
On my shift if you're good at something

07:25:35.180 --> 07:25:37.180
Never do it for free exactly

07:25:37.180 --> 07:25:39.180
The Joker was a kitten

07:25:39.180 --> 07:25:41.180
That's what food coloring is for

07:25:41.180 --> 07:25:43.180
Didn't you get

07:25:43.180 --> 07:25:45.180
With all the girls at the same time

07:25:45.180 --> 07:25:47.180
In the ASMR booth with the eyes covered

07:25:47.180 --> 07:25:49.180
Yeah basically that's how it happens though

07:25:53.180 --> 07:25:55.180
But yeah I've got a sea queen audio

07:25:55.180 --> 07:25:57.180
I think it'll be a donut on reward

07:25:57.180 --> 07:25:59.180
Like cause the girls

07:25:59.180 --> 07:26:01.180
Are all gonna like help each other out

07:26:01.180 --> 07:26:03.180
With their donut on rewards like

07:26:03.180 --> 07:26:05.180
As a

07:26:05.180 --> 07:26:07.180
As a like yeah let's go

07:26:09.180 --> 07:26:11.180
Sea queen that's the only way we can

07:26:11.180 --> 07:26:13.180
That's the new saying

07:26:15.180 --> 07:26:17.180
POV all the girls are fighting over you

07:26:19.180 --> 07:26:21.180
The one human left on earth that hasn't

07:26:21.180 --> 07:26:23.180
Decided on which girl

07:26:23.180 --> 07:26:25.180
I thought about

07:26:25.180 --> 07:26:27.180
I see an Emmy doing something like that

07:26:27.180 --> 07:26:29.180
Where they're fighting over

07:26:31.180 --> 07:26:33.180
Where the ink goes

07:26:33.180 --> 07:26:35.180
Or who the ink goes to

07:26:39.180 --> 07:26:41.180
Sea queen

07:26:41.180 --> 07:26:43.180
Yeah I mean that's pretty creative

07:26:43.180 --> 07:26:45.180
I'll give you that that's pretty creative

07:26:45.180 --> 07:26:47.180
Yeah I see an Emmy with a hundred percent

07:26:47.180 --> 07:26:49.180
Fight over it but I find it really

07:26:49.180 --> 07:26:51.180
Hard

07:26:51.180 --> 07:26:53.180
To do that kind of

07:26:53.180 --> 07:26:55.180
Seven

07:26:55.180 --> 07:26:57.180
Five hundred swordfish and I burned two

07:26:57.180 --> 07:26:59.180
K of them I burnt so much swordfish as well

07:26:59.180 --> 07:27:01.180
Don't worry

07:27:01.180 --> 07:27:03.180
Where the ink goes yeah

07:27:03.180 --> 07:27:05.180
If Emmy and I see ever collab like that

07:27:05.180 --> 07:27:07.180
I would be so happy

07:27:07.180 --> 07:27:09.180
I mean they already got a collab audio on the way

07:27:09.180 --> 07:27:11.180
Of that nature

07:27:11.180 --> 07:27:13.180
But it's a bit

07:27:13.180 --> 07:27:15.180
Different

07:27:15.180 --> 07:27:17.180
Do you want spoilers or do you not want

07:27:17.180 --> 07:27:19.180
Spoilers I don't mind doing spoilers

07:27:19.180 --> 07:27:21.180
I think it's coming up

07:27:21.180 --> 07:27:23.180
Is it August the collab audio start

07:27:23.180 --> 07:27:25.180
Of I think it might be

07:27:27.180 --> 07:27:29.180
It's got to be really hard to do

07:27:29.180 --> 07:27:31.180
I want spoilers

07:27:31.180 --> 07:27:33.180
No spoilers

07:27:33.180 --> 07:27:35.180
Oh no you guys are split

07:27:37.180 --> 07:27:39.180
Go hard with spoilers

07:27:41.180 --> 07:27:43.180
So in the plot

07:27:43.180 --> 07:27:45.180
Close your ears if you don't want

07:27:45.180 --> 07:27:47.180
Any spoilers in the plot

07:27:47.180 --> 07:27:49.180
AC and Emmy fell out

07:27:49.180 --> 07:27:51.180
And you

07:27:51.180 --> 07:27:53.180
The listener

07:27:53.180 --> 07:27:55.180
You can either be a pin pal

07:27:55.180 --> 07:27:57.180
Or a snowberry

07:27:57.180 --> 07:27:59.180
You force them to

07:28:01.180 --> 07:28:03.180
To make up

07:28:03.180 --> 07:28:05.180
By

07:28:05.180 --> 07:28:07.180
Using a massage gun

07:28:07.180 --> 07:28:09.180
To relieve their muscle tension

07:28:09.180 --> 07:28:11.180
Because their muscle

07:28:11.180 --> 07:28:13.180
Tensions the reason why they fell out

07:28:13.180 --> 07:28:15.180
Hmm

07:28:15.180 --> 07:28:17.180
Hmm

07:28:17.180 --> 07:28:19.180
Okay

07:28:19.180 --> 07:28:21.180
Then me and Mercy have one

07:28:21.180 --> 07:28:23.180
Where we're

07:28:23.180 --> 07:28:25.180
Nurses that shouldn't be qualified

07:28:25.180 --> 07:28:27.180
Because of what we do

07:28:27.180 --> 07:28:29.180
And then

07:28:29.180 --> 07:28:31.180
Azura and Sheeby's one

07:28:31.180 --> 07:28:33.180
I don't think the masses

07:28:33.180 --> 07:28:35.180
Are gonna like it

07:28:35.180 --> 07:28:37.180
I'm not gonna change it

07:28:37.180 --> 07:28:39.180
Because I like the script

07:28:39.180 --> 07:28:41.180
I like it but I'm not sure the masses

07:28:41.180 --> 07:28:43.180
Are gonna like it

07:28:43.180 --> 07:28:45.180
Can Sheeby

07:28:45.180 --> 07:28:47.180
Catch you in public

07:28:47.180 --> 07:28:49.180
Um

07:28:49.180 --> 07:28:51.180
Cross-grossing

07:28:51.180 --> 07:28:53.180
And they m-word you

07:28:53.180 --> 07:28:55.180
And I don't know if it's gonna

07:28:55.180 --> 07:28:57.180
Go down well or not

07:28:57.180 --> 07:28:59.180
It's a very unique scenario

07:28:59.180 --> 07:29:01.180
But please

07:29:01.180 --> 07:29:03.180
And before you're like oh my god I hate it

07:29:03.180 --> 07:29:05.180
Oh my god Strony I hope you die in a fire

07:29:05.180 --> 07:29:07.180
Because you wrote that

07:29:07.180 --> 07:29:09.180
Do you honestly think they're never gonna do another collab audio again

07:29:09.180 --> 07:29:11.180
Don't be so silly

07:29:11.180 --> 07:29:13.180
The first one that I gave

07:29:13.180 --> 07:29:15.180
Yeah it was pretty sp- it was pretty

07:29:15.180 --> 07:29:17.180
Out there I don't know it's just the

07:29:17.180 --> 07:29:19.180
Inspiration I got to write for them

07:29:19.180 --> 07:29:21.180
Till I wrote it and there it was

07:29:21.180 --> 07:29:23.180
And they what

07:29:23.180 --> 07:29:25.180
Holy moly this is spicy meatball

07:29:25.180 --> 07:29:27.180
A massage gun yes

07:29:27.180 --> 07:29:29.180
A massage gun I'm excited for that

07:29:29.180 --> 07:29:31.180
It's spicy

07:29:31.180 --> 07:29:33.180
Oh boy that one does sound very uh

07:29:33.180 --> 07:29:35.180
Yes uh

07:29:35.180 --> 07:29:37.180
That sounds like something

07:29:37.180 --> 07:29:39.180
Patreon would get no they don't

07:29:39.180 --> 07:29:41.180
They don't care um

07:29:41.180 --> 07:29:43.180
I know what's uh good

07:29:43.180 --> 07:29:45.180
To go and what's not good to go on Patreon

07:29:45.180 --> 07:29:47.180
So damn y'all really pretty

07:29:47.180 --> 07:29:49.180
Yeah

07:29:49.180 --> 07:29:51.180
There's a few things I wanted to cover um

07:29:55.180 --> 07:29:57.180
Having the freedom to explore a

07:29:57.180 --> 07:29:59.180
Bunch of scripts

07:29:59.180 --> 07:30:01.180
Is something the scripts have

07:30:03.180 --> 07:30:05.180
Yeah like um

07:30:05.180 --> 07:30:07.180
It's just different things were hitting along

07:30:07.180 --> 07:30:09.180
The way like as I said

07:30:09.180 --> 07:30:11.180
I kind of said it from the start

07:30:11.180 --> 07:30:13.180
I'm not pigeon

07:30:13.180 --> 07:30:15.180
Holding any girl

07:30:15.180 --> 07:30:17.180
Into a particular

07:30:17.180 --> 07:30:19.180
Category because doing so

07:30:19.180 --> 07:30:21.180
Will limit their

07:30:21.180 --> 07:30:23.180
Income source and their income source

07:30:23.180 --> 07:30:25.180
And longevity are related

07:30:25.180 --> 07:30:27.180
To their success of the allure

07:30:27.180 --> 07:30:29.180
And I do not want

07:30:29.180 --> 07:30:31.180
To kneecap anyone

07:30:31.180 --> 07:30:33.180
That's not fair

07:30:33.180 --> 07:30:35.180
It is what it is

07:30:35.180 --> 07:30:37.180
In spaces scenarios compared to anything else

07:30:37.180 --> 07:30:39.180
I've seen this is some top two content

07:30:39.180 --> 07:30:41.180
Yes and

07:30:41.180 --> 07:30:43.180
Literally when the girls do collab audios again

07:30:43.180 --> 07:30:45.180
They still have three other audios

07:30:45.180 --> 07:30:47.180
Going out that month as well so it's not like

07:30:47.180 --> 07:30:49.180
You know not everything can be for you

07:30:49.180 --> 07:30:51.180
We live in a society

07:30:51.180 --> 07:30:53.180
Of burnt fish

07:30:55.180 --> 07:30:57.180
I like to try different stuff yeah

07:30:57.180 --> 07:30:59.180
Literally just give it a shot either

07:30:59.180 --> 07:31:01.180
You'll listen to it and you'll be like this isn't for me

07:31:01.180 --> 07:31:03.180
Or you'll be like okay

07:31:03.180 --> 07:31:05.180
I'm reacting

07:31:05.180 --> 07:31:07.180
Smile

07:31:07.180 --> 07:31:09.180
There's only two outcomes

07:31:09.180 --> 07:31:11.180
It's either no thank you and turn it off

07:31:11.180 --> 07:31:13.180
Or I'm reacting smile

07:31:15.180 --> 07:31:17.180
We'll get

07:31:17.180 --> 07:31:19.180
We'll all get something at some time

07:31:19.180 --> 07:31:21.180
Yeah basically literally everyone

07:31:21.180 --> 07:31:23.180
Is here for

07:31:23.180 --> 07:31:25.180
It's not possible

07:31:25.180 --> 07:31:27.180
For a creator to come out with something you love 100%

07:31:27.180 --> 07:31:29.180
At the time it's just not possible

07:31:29.180 --> 07:31:31.180
Unless they do the same thing over and over

07:31:31.180 --> 07:31:33.180
Again but then that is like

07:31:33.180 --> 07:31:35.180
Really pigeonholing and it's

07:31:35.180 --> 07:31:37.180
For the success of my girlies

07:31:37.180 --> 07:31:39.180
Okay

07:31:39.180 --> 07:31:41.180
They gotta succeed

07:31:41.180 --> 07:31:43.180
Or what's gonna make them wanna sign their

07:31:43.180 --> 07:31:45.180
The second year of the contract huh

07:31:47.180 --> 07:31:49.180
Can't wait to find out

07:31:49.180 --> 07:31:51.180
What it is I love

07:31:51.180 --> 07:31:53.180
AC and Katelyn so much

07:31:53.180 --> 07:31:55.180
Aw I'm glad

07:31:55.180 --> 07:31:57.180
Thanks

07:31:57.180 --> 07:31:59.180
Thanks for reading it

07:31:59.180 --> 07:32:01.180
Anyway

07:32:01.180 --> 07:32:03.180
They just misspelled

07:32:03.180 --> 07:32:05.180
Something that said it wrong or something

07:32:05.180 --> 07:32:07.180
It's okay

07:32:07.180 --> 07:32:09.180
I'm not into feet but I like curious

07:32:09.180 --> 07:32:11.180
Oh yeah

07:32:11.180 --> 07:32:13.180
I love everything

07:32:13.180 --> 07:32:15.180
Viewers done so far thank you

07:32:17.180 --> 07:32:19.180
You know I had a year

07:32:19.180 --> 07:32:21.180
In the making and

07:32:21.180 --> 07:32:23.180
Just everything has fallen into place

07:32:23.180 --> 07:32:25.180
So beautifully

07:32:25.180 --> 07:32:27.180
I spoke to

07:32:27.180 --> 07:32:29.180
I'm gonna butcher her name

07:32:29.180 --> 07:32:31.180
So badly

07:32:31.180 --> 07:32:33.180
The beach of her obaque

07:32:33.180 --> 07:32:35.180
That's definitely not how you say it

07:32:35.180 --> 07:32:37.180
But

07:32:37.180 --> 07:32:39.180
She was talking about a project

07:32:39.180 --> 07:32:41.180
Finally coming together and

07:32:41.180 --> 07:32:43.180
You know I was like oh I can completely

07:32:43.180 --> 07:32:45.180
Relate to that so I replied to it

07:32:45.180 --> 07:32:47.180
And I was like

07:32:47.180 --> 07:32:49.180
When the puzzle pieces finally arrive

07:32:49.180 --> 07:32:51.180
And you can start slotting them into place

07:32:51.180 --> 07:32:53.180
It's so satisfying

07:32:53.180 --> 07:32:55.180
And

07:32:55.180 --> 07:32:57.180
And I felt that to my very core

07:32:59.180 --> 07:33:01.180
Obaque

07:33:01.180 --> 07:33:03.180
Yeah it's not obaque

07:33:03.180 --> 07:33:05.180
There's no way that's how you're supposed to say it

07:33:05.180 --> 07:33:07.180
Sounds like I'm trying to say tobacco

07:33:07.180 --> 07:33:09.180
Obaque

07:33:09.180 --> 07:33:11.180
That's exactly how you say obaque

07:33:11.180 --> 07:33:13.180
Oh wow

07:33:13.180 --> 07:33:15.180
Not me

07:33:15.180 --> 07:33:17.180
Accidentally being smart

07:33:17.180 --> 07:33:19.180
I can't believe it

07:33:19.180 --> 07:33:21.180
Obaque

07:33:23.180 --> 07:33:25.180
It is the first try

07:33:25.180 --> 07:33:27.180
I'm so smart with the heck

07:33:27.180 --> 07:33:29.180
Yeah she put up a tweet

07:33:29.180 --> 07:33:31.180
Saying her projects are finally coming together

07:33:31.180 --> 07:33:33.180
And I'm like oh I can relate to that

07:33:33.180 --> 07:33:35.180
On such a deeper level

07:33:37.180 --> 07:33:39.180
And

07:33:39.180 --> 07:33:41.180
When we succeeded to be

07:33:41.180 --> 07:33:43.180
Five moods ahead in her main chess game

07:33:43.180 --> 07:33:45.180
I can't wait to

07:33:45.180 --> 07:33:47.180
One be one years in chess actually

07:33:47.180 --> 07:33:49.180
I'm not ready

07:33:49.180 --> 07:33:51.180
Tobacco stream

07:33:51.180 --> 07:33:53.180
No, no tobacco

07:33:53.180 --> 07:33:55.180
I can't smoke

07:33:55.180 --> 07:33:57.180
I can hardly drink

07:33:57.180 --> 07:33:59.180
To the life of me

07:33:59.180 --> 07:34:01.180
I get one beer in me and I'm gone

07:34:01.180 --> 07:34:03.180
That's why I wanted to do drunk apex

07:34:03.180 --> 07:34:05.180
Because we can all do Salt Lake city server again

07:34:05.180 --> 07:34:07.180
Because no one's in it other than us

07:34:09.180 --> 07:34:11.180
I don't know what drunk game

07:34:11.180 --> 07:34:13.180
I wanted to do drunk game

07:34:13.180 --> 07:34:15.180
But I don't go offline until we win

07:34:15.180 --> 07:34:17.180
Type of thing

07:34:17.180 --> 07:34:19.180
But I didn't know what game to do

07:34:21.180 --> 07:34:23.180
If I lose

07:34:23.180 --> 07:34:25.180
I get to see discord route

07:34:25.180 --> 07:34:27.180
What?

07:34:29.180 --> 07:34:31.180
Wait

07:34:31.180 --> 07:34:33.180
What if you lose the one be one chess

07:34:33.180 --> 07:34:35.180
You get to see the discord where we all say inappropriate stuff

07:34:35.180 --> 07:34:37.180
To each other

07:34:37.180 --> 07:34:39.180
Say no in that one chief

07:34:41.180 --> 07:34:43.180
I've been a lazy reflin

07:34:43.180 --> 07:34:45.180
You haven't

07:34:45.180 --> 07:34:47.180
Have you not checked any of them out

07:34:49.180 --> 07:34:51.180
Actually the highlight

07:34:51.180 --> 07:34:53.180
Reels are from debut

07:34:53.180 --> 07:34:55.180
Or right around the corner

07:34:55.180 --> 07:34:57.180
I think there's one more girl that needs to be made

07:35:01.180 --> 07:35:03.180
And then the debut highlight

07:35:03.180 --> 07:35:05.180
Things can be made

07:35:07.180 --> 07:35:09.180
Can be uploaded

07:35:09.180 --> 07:35:11.180
Check them out

07:35:11.180 --> 07:35:13.180
What opening do you use in chess

07:35:13.180 --> 07:35:15.180
I call it the twat move

07:35:15.180 --> 07:35:17.180
Because I don't know what on earth

07:35:17.180 --> 07:35:19.180
Is my opening move

07:35:19.180 --> 07:35:21.180
Probably the

07:35:21.180 --> 07:35:23.180
Second pawn

07:35:23.180 --> 07:35:25.180
Just shove them out by two

07:35:25.180 --> 07:35:27.180
Have a week go

07:35:27.180 --> 07:35:29.180
I don't know nothing about chess

07:35:29.180 --> 07:35:31.180
All I know is that I want a one be one you guys

07:35:31.180 --> 07:35:33.180
In chess and I'll put classical music

07:35:33.180 --> 07:35:35.180
On in the background

07:35:35.180 --> 07:35:37.180
And I'll see if I can even win against

07:35:37.180 --> 07:35:39.180
One refling

07:35:39.180 --> 07:35:41.180
It'll be interesting to see if I can win one game

07:35:43.180 --> 07:35:45.180
I can easily recommend girls

07:35:45.180 --> 07:35:47.180
Like a shopkeeper

07:35:49.180 --> 07:35:51.180
I have a secret conspiracy

07:35:51.180 --> 07:35:53.180
Strony allows a small handful of fans

07:35:53.180 --> 07:35:55.180
Into the discord every month or so

07:35:55.180 --> 07:35:57.180
To be grim by the girls

07:35:57.180 --> 07:35:59.180
Then makes them forget and kicks them out

07:35:59.180 --> 07:36:01.180
It's actually quite funny

07:36:01.180 --> 07:36:03.180
No I assure you

07:36:03.180 --> 07:36:05.180
Absolutely nothing goes on in the discord

07:36:07.180 --> 07:36:09.180
Mercedes ASMR was a banger

07:36:09.180 --> 07:36:11.180
Is there meme ASMR

We'll go down to the grand exchange

07:38:13.180 --> 07:38:15.180

07:44:55.180 --> 07:44:57.180
Surely I could win one

07:44:57.180 --> 07:44:59.180
Uh

07:44:59.180 --> 07:45:01.180
Right

07:45:01.180 --> 07:45:03.180
I'm gonna go in the middle

07:45:05.180 --> 07:45:07.180
Surely

07:45:07.180 --> 07:45:09.180
Surely I can win

07:45:11.180 --> 07:45:13.180
Okay I'll go above you now

07:45:17.180 --> 07:45:19.180
Um

07:45:19.180 --> 07:45:21.180
Okay no you're just

07:45:21.180 --> 07:45:23.180
Mimicking me

07:45:27.180 --> 07:45:29.180
Um

07:45:35.180 --> 07:45:37.180
Yes

07:45:39.180 --> 07:45:41.180
Are we just mimicking each other

07:45:45.180 --> 07:45:47.180
Oh

07:45:51.180 --> 07:45:53.180
Uh

07:45:53.180 --> 07:45:55.180
Uh

07:45:59.180 --> 07:46:01.180
I'll put it

07:46:01.180 --> 07:46:03.180
Here

07:46:03.180 --> 07:46:05.180
I don't know why I'm putting it

07:46:05.180 --> 07:46:07.180
Here

07:46:07.180 --> 07:46:09.180
Wait why did you

Wait could I have one there

07:46:11.180 --> 07:46:13.180
No I couldn't have

07:46:13.180 --> 07:46:15.180
I'll put one here

07:46:17.180 --> 07:46:19.180
Oh this is hard

07:46:19.180 --> 07:46:21.180
I'm like touching my face

07:46:21.180 --> 07:46:23.180
I don't think I can actually

07:46:23.180 --> 07:46:25.180
Win against any of you guys

07:46:27.180 --> 07:46:29.180
Oh I could have had it

07:46:29.180 --> 07:46:31.180
One two three

07:46:31.180 --> 07:46:33.180
Maybe

07:46:33.180 --> 07:46:35.180
Maybe if I stack

07:46:35.180 --> 07:46:37.180
Here

07:46:37.180 --> 07:46:39.180
I can do like this up here

07:46:45.180 --> 07:46:47.180
Uh

Is he gonna try and go up there

07:46:51.180 --> 07:46:53.180
Did you let me win

07:46:55.180 --> 07:46:57.180
I can't tell if you let me one

07:46:59.180 --> 07:47:01.180
Did you let me win

07:47:03.180 --> 07:47:05.180
Wait

07:47:05.180 --> 07:47:07.180
Wait you didn't mean that

07:47:07.180 --> 07:47:09.180
Did you not see that

07:47:13.180 --> 07:47:15.180
Huh

07:47:15.180 --> 07:47:17.180
I can't tell

07:47:17.180 --> 07:47:19.180
Did you mean that

07:47:19.180 --> 07:47:21.180
Are you at the restaurant

07:47:23.180 --> 07:47:25.180
Are you at the restaurant

07:47:25.180 --> 07:47:27.180
I didn't see that either

07:47:27.180 --> 07:47:29.180
Oh a little distraction

07:47:29.180 --> 07:47:31.180

07:47:33.180 --> 07:47:35.180
Calls

07:47:35.180 --> 07:47:37.180
Let me be green

07:47:55.180 --> 07:47:57.180
Strike

07:47:57.180 --> 07:47:59.180
Okay

07:47:59.180 --> 07:48:01.180
Using them cosmic rings

07:48:01.180 --> 07:48:03.180
Flash your opponent to distract

Yeah

07:48:17.180 --> 07:48:19.180
Um

07:48:19.180 --> 07:48:21.180
We should do like speedruns

07:48:21.180 --> 07:48:23.180
We just have to slap them down

07:48:23.180 --> 07:48:25.180
Okay

07:48:27.180 --> 07:48:29.180
Uh-huh

07:48:31.180 --> 07:48:33.180

A little bit but I'm allowed to mess up a little bit

07:48:43.180 --> 07:48:45.180
And if I put it here

07:48:45.180 --> 07:48:47.180

Thank you

07:49:11.180 --> 07:49:13.180
Uh-huh

07:49:13.180 --> 07:49:15.180
Oh no

07:49:17.180 --> 07:49:19.180
Oh my god

07:49:19.180 --> 07:49:21.180
You stress me so

07:49:21.180 --> 07:49:23.180
So much

07:49:23.180 --> 07:49:25.180
I don't know what to do

07:49:25.180 --> 07:49:27.180
Shawnee go in the third column

07:49:27.180 --> 07:49:29.180
No

07:49:29.180 --> 07:49:31.180
He's gonna win

07:49:31.180 --> 07:49:33.180
If I go in the third column

07:49:33.180 --> 07:49:35.180
He'll go there

07:49:35.180 --> 07:49:37.180
And he gets four in a row

07:49:37.180 --> 07:49:39.180
None of us can play the third column

07:49:39.180 --> 07:49:41.180
Cause if he plays the

07:49:41.180 --> 07:49:43.180
Wait why did you do that

07:49:43.180 --> 07:49:45.180
Why did you do that

07:49:45.180 --> 07:49:47.180
Uh-huh

07:49:47.180 --> 07:49:49.180
Did I distract you

07:49:49.180 --> 07:49:51.180
Wait why did you do that

07:49:51.180 --> 07:49:53.180
Did you mean that you win

07:49:53.180 --> 07:49:55.180
You're right I'm blind

07:49:55.180 --> 07:49:57.180
Uh-huh

07:49:57.180 --> 07:49:59.180
I think you guys are just letting me win now

07:49:59.180 --> 07:50:01.180
I'm gonna be honest

07:50:01.180 --> 07:50:03.180
No matter where I went

07:50:03.180 --> 07:50:05.180
You would have won

07:50:05.180 --> 07:50:07.180
Oh really

07:50:07.180 --> 07:50:09.180
Just Yummy I've not played you

07:50:19.180 --> 07:50:21.180

07:50:23.180 --> 07:50:25.180
What is this

07:50:27.180 --> 07:50:29.180
Oh no I don't know how to play checkers

07:50:29.180 --> 07:50:31.180
Can I just mimic what he does

07:50:31.180 --> 07:50:33.180
Just to annoy him

07:50:33.180 --> 07:50:35.180
I don't know

07:50:35.180 --> 07:50:37.180
I'm not playing this game

07:50:37.180 --> 07:50:39.180
Wait

07:50:39.180 --> 07:50:41.180
How did you do that

07:50:41.180 --> 07:50:43.180
How did you get there

07:50:43.180 --> 07:50:45.180
Yeah

Get ready Reflin

07:50:53.180 --> 07:50:55.180

07:50:55.180 --> 07:50:57.180
How did you do that

07:50:57.180 --> 07:50:59.180
You went back up here

07:51:01.180 --> 07:51:03.180
Right

07:51:03.180 --> 07:51:05.180
I'll change my pattern

07:51:05.180 --> 07:51:07.180
I won't cheat

07:51:07.180 --> 07:51:09.180
I'll change my pattern

07:51:09.180 --> 07:51:11.180
I don't know what I'm doing though

07:51:11.180 --> 07:51:13.180
I think we're just playing

07:51:13.180 --> 07:51:15.180
crisscross apple sauce

07:51:15.180 --> 07:51:17.180
One of the coolest games ever

07:51:17.180 --> 07:51:19.180
Losing all the rank and honestly

07:51:19.180 --> 07:51:21.180
Yeah you actually played well

07:51:21.180 --> 07:51:23.180

You know what I think about

07:51:29.180 --> 07:51:31.180
I'll go here

07:51:31.180 --> 07:51:33.180
Wait I'll go here

07:51:33.180 --> 07:51:35.180
Wait that's not how it works

07:51:35.180 --> 07:51:37.180

07:51:39.180 --> 07:51:41.180
Oh no here sorry

07:51:41.180 --> 07:51:43.180
More of them went green

I didn't even mean that

07:51:45.180 --> 07:51:47.180
I don't know what this is

07:51:47.180 --> 07:51:49.180
I'm having fun

07:51:53.180 --> 07:51:55.180
Are we drawing Pipi

07:51:55.180 --> 07:51:57.180
No

07:51:57.180 --> 07:51:59.180
Did he do something here

07:52:01.180 --> 07:52:03.180
That was juicy

07:52:03.180 --> 07:52:05.180
Whatever that did

07:52:09.180 --> 07:52:11.180
Okay Reflin made a move

07:52:11.180 --> 07:52:13.180

Oh there we go there we go

07:52:31.180 --> 07:52:33.180
Something changed

07:52:33.180 --> 07:52:35.180
Taking mummy out of her element

07:52:35.180 --> 07:52:37.180
Mixer here

07:52:37.180 --> 07:52:39.180
I'm so dumb you're all gonna know I'm so dumb

07:52:39.180 --> 07:52:41.180
It's not your turn

07:52:41.180 --> 07:52:43.180
Okay

07:52:43.180 --> 07:52:45.180

Can I go here

07:52:51.180 --> 07:52:53.180
Can I go here?

07:52:53.180 --> 07:52:55.180
Okay I can go there

07:52:55.180 --> 07:52:57.180
Let him get open

07:52:57.180 --> 07:52:59.180
Mmm

07:52:59.180 --> 07:53:01.180
You have to signage the pieces to rent the player

07:53:01.180 --> 07:53:03.180
Oh no what did he do

07:53:03.180 --> 07:53:05.180
I wasn't paying attention

07:53:05.180 --> 07:53:07.180
Can I go here? No

07:53:07.180 --> 07:53:09.180
Oh I can! How did that work

07:53:09.180 --> 07:53:11.180
I don't know how I did that

07:53:11.180 --> 07:53:13.180
I'm warning you now Reflin

07:53:13.180 --> 07:53:15.180
I'm taking this entire route

07:53:15.180 --> 07:53:17.180
Fuck you I'm taking this route

07:53:17.180 --> 07:53:19.180
How does this work

07:53:19.180 --> 07:53:21.180
I don't know

07:53:21.180 --> 07:53:23.180
This is the most confusing game

07:53:23.180 --> 07:53:25.180
Oh it's my turn

07:53:25.180 --> 07:53:27.180
I didn't even see what you changed

07:53:27.180 --> 07:53:29.180
Here

07:53:29.180 --> 07:53:31.180
Oh that was a terrible move

07:53:31.180 --> 07:53:33.180
Here?

07:53:33.180 --> 07:53:35.180
Okay that was a good move

07:53:35.180 --> 07:53:37.180
Uhh

07:53:39.180 --> 07:53:41.180
I'm not sure

07:53:41.180 --> 07:53:43.180
He made that right up there

07:53:43.180 --> 07:53:45.180
What does that mean for me

07:53:45.180 --> 07:53:47.180
I don't know

07:53:47.180 --> 07:53:49.180
Can I do this?

07:53:49.180 --> 07:53:51.180
I can do that

07:53:51.180 --> 07:53:53.180
I'm just clicking on the board

07:53:53.180 --> 07:53:55.180
I'm going to be honest

07:53:55.180 --> 07:53:57.180
Stony can you hear

07:53:57.180 --> 07:53:59.180
your thick accent for a little bit

07:53:59.180 --> 07:54:01.180
I'm dying to hear it

07:54:01.180 --> 07:54:03.180
Oh you can't

07:54:03.180 --> 07:54:05.180

07:54:13.180 --> 07:54:15.180
I got here

07:54:15.180 --> 07:54:17.180

07:54:19.180 --> 07:54:21.180
your turn

07:54:21.180 --> 07:54:23.180
God this checkers game is hard

07:54:25.180 --> 07:54:27.180
Oh I think I messed up

07:54:27.180 --> 07:54:29.180
I maybe shouldn't have played that

07:54:29.180 --> 07:54:31.180
Oh no

07:54:33.180 --> 07:54:35.180
Umm

07:54:37.180 --> 07:54:39.180
Who's with us at night

07:54:39.180 --> 07:54:41.180
I don't even know if this Reflin

07:54:41.180 --> 07:54:43.180
knows what he's doing

07:54:43.180 --> 07:54:45.180
If you are this cute when playing

07:54:45.180 --> 07:54:47.180
Uhh

07:54:47.180 --> 07:54:49.180
Oh that love heart solo

07:54:49.180 --> 07:54:51.180
Corners are power spots

07:54:51.180 --> 07:54:53.180
When playing I can agree on chess and during stream

07:54:53.180 --> 07:54:55.180
I'm too dumb for connect 4

07:54:55.180 --> 07:54:57.180
Is it my turn yet? Oh no it's not

07:54:57.180 --> 07:54:59.180
Okay now it's my turn

07:54:59.180 --> 07:55:01.180

Wait how do I take it back

07:55:07.180 --> 07:55:09.180
No give me back give me that

07:55:09.180 --> 07:55:11.180
That's mine

07:55:11.180 --> 07:55:13.180
Stop you're taking

07:55:13.180 --> 07:55:15.180
Oh no

07:55:15.180 --> 07:55:17.180
That didn't do anything

07:55:17.180 --> 07:55:19.180
Oh no

07:55:19.180 --> 07:55:21.180
I think I'm losing

07:55:21.180 --> 07:55:23.180
What does that do

07:55:23.180 --> 07:55:25.180
Like this

07:55:25.180 --> 07:55:27.180
Does that do something

07:55:27.180 --> 07:55:29.180
I don't know what I'm doing

07:55:29.180 --> 07:55:31.180
I think I might

07:55:31.180 --> 07:55:33.180
I think we have to admit defeat unfortunately

07:55:33.180 --> 07:55:35.180
Oh I'm getting ruled

07:55:35.180 --> 07:55:37.180
Everything's getting taken

07:55:37.180 --> 07:55:41.180
I don't have the strength

07:55:41.180 --> 07:55:43.180
Reflins I'm doing so bad

07:55:47.180 --> 07:55:49.180
Uh

07:55:49.180 --> 07:55:51.180
Connect your pieces

07:55:51.180 --> 07:55:53.180
Oh corner someone says corner

07:55:53.180 --> 07:55:55.180
I'll play the corner

07:55:55.180 --> 07:55:57.180
Oh sugar that didn't do anything

07:55:57.180 --> 07:55:59.180
Oh no

07:55:59.180 --> 07:56:01.180
We are

07:56:01.180 --> 07:56:03.180
Okay green green I see green

07:56:03.180 --> 07:56:05.180

07:56:05.180 --> 07:56:07.180
Uh but that turn green

07:56:07.180 --> 07:56:09.180
A little bit green

07:56:11.180 --> 07:56:13.180
I guess it's like splatoon where you want

07:56:13.180 --> 07:56:15.180
Everything to be your colors

07:56:15.180 --> 07:56:17.180
Oh that didn't do anything oops

07:56:17.180 --> 07:56:19.180
I think I just threw that

07:56:19.180 --> 07:56:21.180
You lose the board just filled

07:56:21.180 --> 07:56:23.180
Oh no that was so hard

07:56:23.180 --> 07:56:25.180
That was confusing

07:56:25.180 --> 07:56:27.180
Uh maybe we

07:56:27.180 --> 07:56:29.180
Only do the other one

07:56:29.180 --> 07:56:31.180
Oh Amy wants to play yeah sure

07:56:31.180 --> 07:56:33.180

07:56:35.180 --> 07:56:37.180
Amy's turn

07:56:37.180 --> 07:56:39.180

07:56:39.180 --> 07:56:41.180
Right Amy you're getting ruled

07:56:41.180 --> 07:56:43.180
I'm going here Amy

07:56:43.180 --> 07:56:45.180
And you're not going to have a clue

07:56:45.180 --> 07:56:47.180
What's going to hit you because I'm so good at this game

07:56:49.180 --> 07:56:51.180
I have the peeler

07:56:53.180 --> 07:56:55.180

07:57:15.180 --> 07:57:17.180
What are you thinking

07:57:17.180 --> 07:57:19.180
I'm trying to get in your head

07:57:19.180 --> 07:57:21.180
Or actually you're a pen pal

07:57:21.180 --> 07:57:23.180
What were you doing pen pal

07:57:23.180 --> 07:57:25.180
Are you trying to embarrass me

07:57:25.180 --> 07:57:27.180
Oh shit you're about to get that

07:57:27.180 --> 07:57:29.180

07:57:31.180 --> 07:57:33.180
I never even saw that

07:57:33.180 --> 07:57:35.180
That was like my fastest freaking law

07:57:35.180 --> 07:57:37.180
Pen pals are ruling me

07:57:37.180 --> 07:57:39.180
I never saw that at all

07:57:39.180 --> 07:57:41.180
I was too busy focusing on my little right side play there

07:57:41.180 --> 07:57:43.180
You've not played against you yet

07:57:43.180 --> 07:57:45.180
I'm going green

07:57:47.180 --> 07:57:49.180
Your turn first

07:57:51.180 --> 07:57:53.180

07:58:01.180 --> 07:58:03.180
And then

07:58:03.180 --> 07:58:05.180
No you're not supposed to do that

07:58:05.180 --> 07:58:07.180
You're supposed to let me win

07:58:09.180 --> 07:58:11.180

I think I've already lost

07:58:23.180 --> 07:58:25.180
We didn't even start to do it

07:58:25.180 --> 07:58:27.180
I think I lost

07:58:27.180 --> 07:58:29.180
I'm not supposed to see my

07:58:29.180 --> 07:58:31.180
MLG pro moves

07:58:41.180 --> 07:58:43.180

07:59:03.180 --> 07:59:05.180
Yeah I was going to say you already won

07:59:05.180 --> 07:59:07.180

07:59:09.180 --> 07:59:11.180
Wow this is so hard

07:59:11.180 --> 07:59:13.180
I don't know how people play this

07:59:13.180 --> 07:59:15.180
Anymore of these things

07:59:15.180 --> 07:59:17.180
I want to play

07:59:17.180 --> 07:59:19.180

07:59:21.180 --> 07:59:23.180
Oh wait I might miss that

07:59:23.180 --> 07:59:25.180
You can't do that here

07:59:25.180 --> 07:59:27.180

07:59:39.180 --> 07:59:41.180
Another player resigned

07:59:41.180 --> 07:59:43.180
Did you mean that

07:59:43.180 --> 07:59:45.180
I don't think you meant that

07:59:45.180 --> 07:59:47.180
Do you want to try again

07:59:47.180 --> 07:59:49.180
Okay there we go

07:59:49.180 --> 07:59:51.180

08:01:45.180 --> 08:01:47.180
There has to be a reefling

08:01:47.180 --> 08:01:49.180
That has a lower IQ

08:01:49.180 --> 08:01:51.180
What the heck is this

08:01:51.180 --> 08:01:53.180

08:02:03.180 --> 08:02:05.180

08:02:17.180 --> 08:02:19.180

08:02:21.180 --> 08:02:23.180
Oh

08:02:23.180 --> 08:02:25.180
Okay okay

08:02:25.180 --> 08:02:27.180
You hold it and then drop it

08:02:27.180 --> 08:02:29.180
Wait I'm getting pranked

08:02:29.180 --> 08:02:31.180

08:02:45.180 --> 08:02:47.180
Can I just start moving them everywhere

08:02:47.180 --> 08:02:49.180
No

08:02:49.180 --> 08:02:51.180

08:02:59.180 --> 08:03:01.180
So I move you

08:03:01.180 --> 08:03:03.180

08:03:07.180 --> 08:03:09.180

08:03:31.180 --> 08:03:33.180
A legal move

08:03:33.180 --> 08:03:35.180
Bro I don't even know the rule book

08:03:35.180 --> 08:03:37.180
I don't want to get jailed

08:03:39.180 --> 08:03:41.180
No

08:03:49.180 --> 08:03:51.180
I don't

08:03:51.180 --> 08:03:53.180
Wait what

08:03:53.180 --> 08:03:55.180
Like this

08:03:55.180 --> 08:03:57.180
Okay that was a load

08:03:57.180 --> 08:03:59.180
Why are some things loaded not

08:04:03.180 --> 08:04:05.180
Oh

08:04:05.180 --> 08:04:07.180
Uh

08:04:07.180 --> 08:04:09.180
In the name of the checkers board

08:04:09.180 --> 08:04:11.180
Wait I can't do that

08:04:11.180 --> 08:04:13.180
Hold in the name of the checkers

08:04:13.180 --> 08:04:15.180
Hold in the name of the checkers board

08:04:15.180 --> 08:04:17.180
Hold in the name of the checkers board

08:04:17.180 --> 08:04:19.180
What

08:04:19.180 --> 08:04:21.180
This is crazy

08:04:23.180 --> 08:04:25.180
I'm sorry my little brain can't

08:04:25.180 --> 08:04:27.180
Do this

08:04:27.180 --> 08:04:29.180
Maybe we just play the four in a row

08:04:29.180 --> 08:04:31.180
You can only move one tail

08:04:31.180 --> 08:04:33.180
If you're jumping over an enemy

08:04:33.180 --> 08:04:35.180
As many times as you can

08:04:35.180 --> 08:04:37.180
What happened

08:04:37.180 --> 08:04:39.180
Something happens

08:04:41.180 --> 08:04:43.180
You can only jump a tail

08:04:43.180 --> 08:04:45.180
So here

08:04:45.180 --> 08:04:47.180
No

08:04:47.180 --> 08:04:49.180
It's not your turn oh sorry

08:04:49.180 --> 08:04:51.180
What and then do that

08:04:51.180 --> 08:04:53.180
What the heck

08:04:55.180 --> 08:04:57.180
Am I accidentally winning right now

08:04:59.180 --> 08:05:01.180
I might be

08:05:01.180 --> 08:05:03.180
It's plausible

08:05:03.180 --> 08:05:05.180
Oh you can't go back you can only go up

08:05:05.180 --> 08:05:07.180
Okay

08:05:07.180 --> 08:05:09.180
Wait they didn't do anything

08:05:11.180 --> 08:05:13.180
Can you be like gridlocked in this game

08:05:15.180 --> 08:05:17.180
Yes

08:05:19.180 --> 08:05:21.180
Uh sure go up there then

08:05:21.180 --> 08:05:23.180
Wow what am I doing

08:05:23.180 --> 08:05:25.180
I can't go back

08:05:25.180 --> 08:05:27.180
If you reach the end of the board

08:05:27.180 --> 08:05:29.180
You get knighted

08:05:29.180 --> 08:05:31.180
Oh

08:05:31.180 --> 08:05:33.180
Oh no he won

08:05:35.180 --> 08:05:37.180
I lost again

08:05:39.180 --> 08:05:41.180
Reflames

08:05:41.180 --> 08:05:43.180
Oh my god

08:05:43.180 --> 08:05:45.180
I don't know what I'm saying

08:05:45.180 --> 08:05:47.180
No he won

08:05:47.180 --> 08:05:49.180
I can't go back

08:05:49.180 --> 08:05:51.180
And won't let me go back on him

08:05:55.180 --> 08:05:57.180
Right okay what can I do

08:05:57.180 --> 08:05:59.180
I can't even go forward or anything

08:05:59.180 --> 08:06:01.180
I just did that

08:06:01.180 --> 08:06:03.180
Game ends when all the pieces are taken

08:06:03.180 --> 08:06:05.180
How can they be taken

08:06:05.180 --> 08:06:07.180
We can't go backwards

08:06:07.180 --> 08:06:09.180
I don't get it

08:06:09.180 --> 08:06:11.180
I'm so confused

08:06:11.180 --> 08:06:13.180
He's not won yet

08:06:13.180 --> 08:06:15.180
What

08:06:15.180 --> 08:06:17.180
I don't know what's going on

08:06:19.180 --> 08:06:21.180
Wait so if he comes here

08:06:21.180 --> 08:06:23.180
I can only jump forward one

08:06:23.180 --> 08:06:25.180
Oh

08:06:27.180 --> 08:06:29.180
This is too hard

08:06:29.180 --> 08:06:31.180
Oh no what happened

08:06:31.180 --> 08:06:33.180
Something changed

08:06:33.180 --> 08:06:35.180
I don't know

08:06:35.180 --> 08:06:37.180
So I can't go backwards

08:06:37.180 --> 08:06:39.180
I can only go forward

08:06:39.180 --> 08:06:41.180
Well then I might as well push forward then

08:06:41.180 --> 08:06:43.180
Surely

08:06:43.180 --> 08:06:45.180
Surely that's how it works

08:06:47.180 --> 08:06:49.180
Okay

08:06:49.180 --> 08:06:51.180
And now then I take you

08:06:51.180 --> 08:06:53.180
No I can't take you

08:06:53.180 --> 08:06:55.180
You're too far away from me

08:06:57.180 --> 08:06:59.180
Then I push you forward

08:06:59.180 --> 08:07:01.180
To play

08:07:01.180 --> 08:07:03.180
I guess

08:07:03.180 --> 08:07:05.180
No I don't one at a time

08:07:05.180 --> 08:07:07.180
Sorry one move at a time

08:07:07.180 --> 08:07:09.180
Apologies one step

08:07:09.180 --> 08:07:11.180
Oh this is so hard

08:07:11.180 --> 08:07:13.180
Oh no my guy got taken

08:07:13.180 --> 08:07:15.180
Wait how do you

08:07:15.180 --> 08:07:17.180
So I can only go one way

08:07:17.180 --> 08:07:19.180
Then that would push

08:07:19.180 --> 08:07:21.180
What that pushes him there

08:07:21.180 --> 08:07:23.180
And then I can't push up so I need to do that

08:07:23.180 --> 08:07:25.180
Oh no that blocks him

08:07:25.180 --> 08:07:27.180
Oh I didn't mean to do that

08:07:29.180 --> 08:07:31.180
What does a knight do

08:07:31.180 --> 08:07:33.180
I don't know

08:07:33.180 --> 08:07:35.180
I'm not sure

08:07:35.180 --> 08:07:37.180
Can he take everything now

08:07:41.180 --> 08:07:43.180
And then can go backwards

08:07:43.180 --> 08:07:45.180
Oh wait

08:07:45.180 --> 08:07:47.180
So I just need to move him forward

08:07:47.180 --> 08:07:49.180
Like here

08:07:49.180 --> 08:07:51.180
Okay I'll push him forward

08:07:51.180 --> 08:07:53.180
Oh he got taken

08:07:53.180 --> 08:07:55.180
Wait hold on I'll push him forward then

08:07:55.180 --> 08:07:57.180
Wait am I going to perish

08:07:57.180 --> 08:07:59.180
I think I'm going to perish

08:07:59.180 --> 08:08:01.180
I don't think I can win

08:08:01.180 --> 08:08:03.180
And then you move up

08:08:03.180 --> 08:08:05.180
Oh no I didn't mean that

08:08:07.180 --> 08:08:09.180
And then I push up

08:08:09.180 --> 08:08:11.180
And then what

08:08:11.180 --> 08:08:13.180
What happens then

08:08:13.180 --> 08:08:15.180
In the head

08:08:15.180 --> 08:08:17.180
Yeah I'm not winning that one

08:08:17.180 --> 08:08:19.180
Okay let's try again

08:08:19.180 --> 08:08:21.180
That was

08:08:21.180 --> 08:08:23.180
Yeah that was

08:08:23.180 --> 08:08:25.180
I wasn't sure about that one

08:08:25.180 --> 08:08:27.180
I'm not sure about that one

08:08:27.180 --> 08:08:29.180
Run Riefling

08:08:29.180 --> 08:08:31.180
I don't think I've played with you yet

08:08:33.180 --> 08:08:35.180
Okay surely I can win

08:08:35.180 --> 08:08:37.180
Oh it's not my turn yet

08:08:37.180 --> 08:08:39.180
Oops

08:08:39.180 --> 08:08:41.180
Okay you

08:08:41.180 --> 08:08:43.180
You are getting

08:08:43.180 --> 08:08:45.180
Blyat

08:08:45.180 --> 08:08:47.180
Can't handle it

08:08:57.180 --> 08:08:59.180
Block you from doing it there

08:09:01.180 --> 08:09:03.180
I'll take you

08:09:07.180 --> 08:09:09.180
Oh no this Riefling is thinking

08:09:09.180 --> 08:09:11.180
You're not supposed to think against me

08:09:13.180 --> 08:09:15.180
Monka

08:09:15.180 --> 08:09:17.180
What's this Riefling thinking

08:09:17.180 --> 08:09:19.180
I don't know he's taking his time

08:09:19.180 --> 08:09:21.180
I'm getting nervous

08:09:21.180 --> 08:09:23.180
I'm getting nervous

08:09:23.180 --> 08:09:25.180
What he's planning

08:09:25.180 --> 08:09:27.180
I don't know what he's doing

08:09:27.180 --> 08:09:29.180
I can't see it if he's doing something

08:09:31.180 --> 08:09:33.180
I don't see it

08:09:33.180 --> 08:09:35.180
Here

08:09:35.180 --> 08:09:37.180
I don't know what Riefling is planning

08:09:37.180 --> 08:09:39.180
Riefling is planning

08:09:43.180 --> 08:09:45.180
I'll take that then

08:09:45.180 --> 08:09:47.180
You're not getting a 4 in the rule of me

08:09:47.180 --> 08:09:49.180
I don't know

08:09:49.180 --> 08:09:51.180
If I do this

08:09:51.180 --> 08:09:53.180
No

08:09:55.180 --> 08:09:57.180
I block you

08:09:57.180 --> 08:09:59.180
Then what

08:09:59.180 --> 08:10:01.180
Riefling

08:10:05.180 --> 08:10:07.180
What the heck

08:10:09.180 --> 08:10:11.180
No you weren't supposed to see

08:10:11.180 --> 08:10:13.180
You're supposed to be like

08:10:13.180 --> 08:10:15.180
La-dee-da-dee-da

08:10:15.180 --> 08:10:17.180
Strawny is too dumb to figure this out

08:10:21.180 --> 08:10:23.180
Okay

08:10:23.180 --> 08:10:25.180
So now what

08:10:25.180 --> 08:10:27.180
Are you gonna put it there

08:10:27.180 --> 08:10:29.180
No he's gonna put it there

08:10:29.180 --> 08:10:31.180
Wait hold on

08:10:31.180 --> 08:10:33.180
1 2 3 3 3

08:10:33.180 --> 08:10:35.180
So if I put it there

08:10:35.180 --> 08:10:37.180
He has to go there

08:10:39.180 --> 08:10:41.180
Will she finally get the dub

08:10:41.180 --> 08:10:43.180
I have no idea

08:10:43.180 --> 08:10:45.180
There has to be a Riefling that's lower IQ than me

08:10:45.180 --> 08:10:47.180
Wait you block me

08:10:49.180 --> 08:10:51.180
Oh sugar

08:10:51.180 --> 08:10:53.180
I wasn't supposed to do that

08:10:53.180 --> 08:10:55.180
Oopsies I foiled my own plan

08:10:55.180 --> 08:10:57.180
Literally you don't even need to

08:10:57.180 --> 08:10:59.180
Counteract me I counteract myself

08:11:03.180 --> 08:11:05.180
You already beat me

08:11:05.180 --> 08:11:07.180
Strawny my IQ is too low

08:11:07.180 --> 08:11:09.180
This is hard

08:11:09.180 --> 08:11:11.180
You're kicked

08:11:11.180 --> 08:11:13.180
It's so bad

08:11:13.180 --> 08:11:15.180
Wait we'll have 1 2

08:11:15.180 --> 08:11:17.180
4 you can't

08:11:17.180 --> 08:11:19.180
So never

08:11:21.180 --> 08:11:23.180
No

08:11:23.180 --> 08:11:25.180
I'm so confused

08:11:33.180 --> 08:11:35.180
Are we both playing the same game right now

08:11:37.180 --> 08:11:39.180
We're both scared to play here

08:11:39.180 --> 08:11:41.180
Cause I win if he plays here

08:11:43.180 --> 08:11:45.180
Oh no

08:11:47.180 --> 08:11:49.180
Oh I wasn't freaking

08:11:49.180 --> 08:11:51.180
Bro what is this game so

08:11:51.180 --> 08:11:53.180
Freakin hard to win

08:11:53.180 --> 08:11:55.180
Honestly

08:11:55.180 --> 08:11:57.180
All of us

08:11:57.180 --> 08:11:59.180
Literally

08:11:59.180 --> 08:12:01.180
How are you all smarter than me

08:12:01.180 --> 08:12:03.180
This doesn't make any sense

08:12:03.180 --> 08:12:05.180
How are you so freaking smart

08:12:09.180 --> 08:12:11.180
Bro how is this game so hard

08:12:13.180 --> 08:12:15.180
You could have won

08:12:15.180 --> 08:12:17.180
Just placed it in the middle

08:12:17.180 --> 08:12:19.180
No he was gonna block me

08:12:21.180 --> 08:12:23.180
No

08:12:23.180 --> 08:12:25.180
Surely I can win one

08:12:25.180 --> 08:12:27.180
Surely freaking temples I can win one

08:12:27.180 --> 08:12:29.180
One faking

08:12:29.180 --> 08:12:31.180
Round

08:12:31.180 --> 08:12:33.180
Of this this is so hard

08:12:33.180 --> 08:12:35.180
It's cause we're

08:12:35.180 --> 08:12:37.180
It's cause we're men

08:12:37.180 --> 08:12:39.180
Riefling you can't say that part

08:12:39.180 --> 08:12:41.180
That's supposed to be the quiet part

08:12:45.180 --> 08:12:47.180
Breed and honest I was barely screaming

08:12:47.180 --> 08:12:49.180
Bye my brains fried

08:12:49.180 --> 08:12:51.180
Bro I'm like fainting this so

08:12:51.180 --> 08:12:53.180
Freakin hard

08:12:55.180 --> 08:12:57.180
Like I'm gonna get rekt

08:12:57.180 --> 08:12:59.180
I'm gonna get rekt

08:13:01.180 --> 08:13:03.180
No

08:13:03.180 --> 08:13:05.180
You see me

08:13:07.180 --> 08:13:09.180
Hello Miss Cuddles how is your Friday night

08:13:09.180 --> 08:13:11.180
It's going good but I'm getting

08:13:11.180 --> 08:13:13.180
Freakin rekt I'm getting rekt

08:13:13.180 --> 08:13:15.180
I was gonna do something here

08:13:15.180 --> 08:13:17.180
Wait

08:13:17.180 --> 08:13:19.180
Did you

08:13:19.180 --> 08:13:21.180
Did you let me win

08:13:23.180 --> 08:13:25.180
Did I win

08:13:25.180 --> 08:13:27.180
Did I win

08:13:27.180 --> 08:13:29.180
Did I win

08:13:29.180 --> 08:13:31.180
Okay hold on I wanna do that again

08:13:31.180 --> 08:13:33.180
See when I win I get serotonin

08:13:33.180 --> 08:13:35.180
When I don't win I get

08:13:35.180 --> 08:13:37.180
Here we go tiny Cuddles

08:13:37.180 --> 08:13:39.180
I've played you I haven't played you yet

08:13:41.180 --> 08:13:43.180
My take away is here hold on

08:13:43.180 --> 08:13:45.180
Give me one minute I need to go

08:13:45.180 --> 08:13:47.180
Answer the door

08:13:47.180 --> 08:13:49.180
I'm getting rekt

08:13:49.180 --> 08:13:51.180
Hold on

08:13:55.180 --> 08:13:57.180
Hold on

08:13:57.180 --> 08:13:59.180
My bets like Gimli's about to complain

08:14:15.180 --> 08:14:17.180
Give me

08:14:35.180 --> 08:14:37.180
Give me

08:14:37.180 --> 08:14:39.180
Give me

08:14:41.180 --> 08:14:43.180
Are we ready

08:14:43.180 --> 08:14:45.180
I'm ready for Friday.

08:14:46.180 --> 08:14:49.180
Okay, I'm going to be eating and doing this at the same time.

08:14:49.180 --> 08:14:51.180
So you must forgive me if I'm extra dumb.

08:14:51.180 --> 08:14:54.180
Thank you the tonnethou for the two.

08:14:54.180 --> 08:14:56.180
I'm currently getting wrecked at RuneScape.

08:14:57.180 --> 08:15:00.180
It's not looking good. How do I counteract this?

08:15:00.180 --> 08:15:02.180
I need to go here.

08:15:05.180 --> 08:15:09.180
And then I need to stop you from making a four over here.

08:15:10.180 --> 08:15:12.180
This is such a big...

08:15:13.180 --> 08:15:18.180
I got a chicken wrap with sugar.

08:15:18.180 --> 08:15:20.180
Why are you so tall?

08:15:20.180 --> 08:15:22.180
I feel like I'm going to lose this one as well.

08:15:22.180 --> 08:15:24.180
You feel like I can't do it?

08:15:26.180 --> 08:15:29.180
Oh my god, I'm eating chips and it's so good.

08:15:31.180 --> 08:15:33.180
It's so yummy.

08:15:37.180 --> 08:15:39.180
Chicken wrap with sugar?

08:15:40.180 --> 08:15:42.180
Wait, is that a thing?

08:15:42.180 --> 08:15:44.180
No, it's just a chicken burrito wrap.

08:15:45.180 --> 08:15:47.180
Oh no, this is a lot of red.

08:15:47.180 --> 08:15:50.180
I don't like it. I see red, I see red, I see red.

08:15:51.180 --> 08:15:53.180
Here?

08:15:54.180 --> 08:15:56.180
I don't know what I'm doing.

08:16:00.180 --> 08:16:02.180
I'm too busy munching.

08:16:03.180 --> 08:16:05.180
Delicious.

08:16:06.180 --> 08:16:08.180
I said sugar. Oh, I said oh sugar.

08:16:08.180 --> 08:16:10.180
I said oh sugar instead of oh.

08:16:13.180 --> 08:16:16.180
I'll stop you right there criminal scum.

08:16:23.180 --> 08:16:25.180
I'm not going to mess this up.

08:16:25.180 --> 08:16:27.180
No, you're going to play there.

08:16:27.180 --> 08:16:29.180
What? How do you not play there?

08:16:33.180 --> 08:16:37.180
No, you smell my fricking connection.

08:16:38.180 --> 08:16:40.180
I don't really want to place it there.

08:16:43.180 --> 08:16:47.180
I wasn't even paying attention.

08:16:47.180 --> 08:16:50.180
No, come on man.

08:16:50.180 --> 08:16:53.180
Come on, I'm getting rolled.

08:16:53.180 --> 08:16:55.180
Are you squiddling me?

08:16:55.180 --> 08:16:56.180
Who do you please me?

08:16:56.180 --> 08:16:58.180
Please share, mama.

08:16:58.180 --> 08:17:00.180
Oh, you guys not Ian, thank you for the tip boy.

08:17:00.180 --> 08:17:02.180
You guys not Ian, you want to go ah?

08:17:03.180 --> 08:17:05.180
I'm not pleased you.

08:17:06.180 --> 08:17:10.180
You win.

08:17:10.180 --> 08:17:12.180
Oh, you didn't mean that.

08:17:15.180 --> 08:17:17.180
Sniffer, sniffer Ian.

08:17:19.180 --> 08:17:23.180
Everyone's are going to starve because we're getting so distracted trying to win.

08:17:23.180 --> 08:17:25.180
Why did I not work?

08:17:30.180 --> 08:17:32.180
Here. Oh no.

08:17:32.180 --> 08:17:34.180
I'm blue.

08:17:34.180 --> 08:17:37.180
Abba de abba die, I'm blue.

08:17:37.180 --> 08:17:40.180
I would be off a guy.

08:17:40.180 --> 08:17:43.180
Now listen up, here's the story.

08:17:43.180 --> 08:17:48.180
I found a little cuttlefish in the deep blue sea.

08:17:48.180 --> 08:17:52.180
Everything was blue and visited the minimum.

08:17:52.180 --> 08:17:55.180
Yeah, nobody to listen.

08:17:55.180 --> 08:18:00.180
I knew I would meet up a guy.

08:18:05.180 --> 08:18:08.180
Wow, it's cold on my hands.

08:18:08.180 --> 08:18:10.180
That guy literally.

08:18:14.180 --> 08:18:17.180
Hold on, I'm getting my burrito at my weebops.

08:18:21.180 --> 08:18:23.180
I can't do that.

08:18:24.180 --> 08:18:26.180
I need to do that, don't know.

08:18:26.180 --> 08:18:28.180
I do, I do.

08:18:30.180 --> 08:18:31.180
Oh no.

08:18:31.180 --> 08:18:34.180
You're not supposed to do that, I'm going to hear them.

08:18:34.180 --> 08:18:36.180
Yeah wait, far.

08:18:38.180 --> 08:18:41.180
No, you're not supposed to win against me.

08:18:43.180 --> 08:18:45.180
Okay, I'm opening up my burrito.

08:18:45.180 --> 08:18:48.180
My burrito with no cilantro.

08:18:48.180 --> 08:18:51.180
Because we do not like cilantro on the top.

08:18:52.180 --> 08:18:54.180
Wow, oh yeah, hold on.

08:18:56.180 --> 08:18:58.180
Oh no, what is this?

08:18:59.180 --> 08:19:04.180
Mmm, oh my god, it's delicious.

08:19:04.180 --> 08:19:07.180
Oh shiisa, shiisa.

08:19:07.180 --> 08:19:10.180
He's doing that, he's gunning for that.

08:19:10.180 --> 08:19:13.180
I can tell Riefland, I can see right through your thought process right now.

08:19:13.180 --> 08:19:15.180
No, I was going to put there.

08:19:15.180 --> 08:19:19.180
Wait, why can I not put here?

08:19:19.180 --> 08:19:22.180
He puts here, I put there.

08:19:22.180 --> 08:19:25.180
No, I put there, he puts there.

08:19:25.180 --> 08:19:27.180
I win.

08:19:28.180 --> 08:19:30.180
But why would you do that?

08:19:30.180 --> 08:19:34.180
One, two, one, two, three, he wins.

08:19:34.180 --> 08:19:36.180
Reh.

08:19:39.180 --> 08:19:42.180
You could have had it, spare.

08:19:46.180 --> 08:19:47.180
Here?

08:19:48.180 --> 08:19:50.180
Oh wait, oh no!

08:19:51.180 --> 08:19:56.180
Oh no, I did, I remembered like literally as I put that down.

08:19:56.180 --> 08:19:58.180
Oh my god.

08:19:58.180 --> 08:20:02.180
Bruv, I literally just threw that game, I could have won that.

08:20:02.180 --> 08:20:04.180
Bruv.

08:20:04.180 --> 08:20:07.180
I could have won it, Grimble.

08:20:12.180 --> 08:20:17.180
It is too hard, it's so freaking hard to win Grimble, thank you for the tip.

08:20:17.180 --> 08:20:20.180
Literally Hypnosis is the only reason I can get away with it.

08:20:20.180 --> 08:20:22.180
Have I played with D-Riefland?

08:20:22.180 --> 08:20:24.180
I don't think so.

08:20:24.180 --> 08:20:27.180
Go again, boom.

08:20:27.180 --> 08:20:29.180
No, my turn.

08:20:31.180 --> 08:20:34.180
A well deserved loss.

08:20:34.180 --> 08:20:38.180
Okay, look, I have room temperature IQ, I'm trying my best.

08:20:42.180 --> 08:20:45.180
Right, no, don't do that.

08:20:48.180 --> 08:20:50.180
Mmm.

08:20:58.180 --> 08:21:02.180
But, I think you've played them all at least once now.

08:21:02.180 --> 08:21:04.180
Yeah, go away.

08:21:05.180 --> 08:21:09.180
Our darling low IQ Veeche bar, honestly.

08:21:09.180 --> 08:21:13.180
More like our dangerously low IQ Veeche bar.

08:21:14.180 --> 08:21:16.180
Hmm.

08:21:16.180 --> 08:21:19.180
Oh my god, this is like a wish.

08:21:24.180 --> 08:21:27.180
Yeah, I fucking love pepper.

08:21:27.180 --> 08:21:30.180
You know what, chicken is the MVP, I'm not even playing.

08:21:30.180 --> 08:21:35.180
Oh no, that is a good one, two, three, four.

08:21:35.180 --> 08:21:38.180
What if I go here then?

08:21:43.180 --> 08:21:46.180
I don't know what happened if I do for them.

08:21:48.180 --> 08:21:52.180
Ah, I freaking love chicken sauce, it's like the best meat sauce ever.

08:21:55.180 --> 08:21:59.180
Girls are cute when they're almost reeflings.

08:21:59.180 --> 08:22:01.180
Wait, is that my turn?

08:22:01.180 --> 08:22:03.180
What did you do?

08:22:03.180 --> 08:22:05.180
What did you do?

08:22:05.180 --> 08:22:07.180
Thank you for the game, strong.

08:22:07.180 --> 08:22:09.180
Oh, you're welcome, you don't have to take me for that.

08:22:09.180 --> 08:22:11.180
I have no idea what you did though.

08:22:11.180 --> 08:22:13.180
Oh wait, this reeflings the end.

08:22:13.180 --> 08:22:15.180
What did you do?

08:22:15.180 --> 08:22:17.180
Is there something here?

08:22:17.180 --> 08:22:19.180
I think I'm having something here.

08:22:23.180 --> 08:22:25.180
Papago?

08:22:29.180 --> 08:22:31.180
Alright, what happened if I go here?

08:22:31.180 --> 08:22:33.180
I don't know, maybe I need to go down here?

08:22:33.180 --> 08:22:35.180
Alright.

08:22:40.180 --> 08:22:42.180
Here maybe?

08:22:42.180 --> 08:22:44.180
I don't know.

08:22:46.180 --> 08:22:48.180
If I go here then I'll lose, I hope not.

08:22:52.180 --> 08:22:54.180
One, two, three, eh.

08:22:54.180 --> 08:22:56.180
So eh.

08:22:57.180 --> 08:22:59.180
Eh.

08:23:00.180 --> 08:23:02.180
Ah, it's a fucking thing!

08:23:03.180 --> 08:23:06.180
I have a fucking way to stay, it's so hard.

08:23:07.180 --> 08:23:09.180
I don't even see it.

08:23:10.180 --> 08:23:13.180
I literally can't even see it at all.

08:23:15.180 --> 08:23:17.180
This is so hard though.

08:23:17.180 --> 08:23:20.180
Is there any reeflings I haven't gone against?

08:23:21.180 --> 08:23:23.180
I haven't gone against everyone here.

08:23:27.180 --> 08:23:29.180
That's so hard.

08:23:29.180 --> 08:23:31.180
Right, have I gone against everyone here?

08:23:31.180 --> 08:23:33.180
I may have, you know that.

08:23:35.180 --> 08:23:37.180
Are you a reefling? All fans?

08:23:37.180 --> 08:23:39.180
All fans?

08:23:40.180 --> 08:23:43.180
Maybe they're just confused why there's so many people here.

08:23:44.180 --> 08:23:46.180
Does anyone want to go again?

08:23:46.180 --> 08:23:48.180
Because I can play while I eat.

08:23:50.180 --> 08:23:53.180
I think we're on run two, I think everyone's having a fair share.

08:23:57.180 --> 08:23:59.180
Eh.

08:23:59.180 --> 08:24:02.180
Look how all of you guys have numbers and stuff now,

08:24:02.180 --> 08:24:04.180
because you've been beating me.

08:24:04.180 --> 08:24:06.180
Hold on, eat, eat.

08:24:06.180 --> 08:24:08.180
Um.

08:24:09.180 --> 08:24:11.180
I'm eating my time.

08:24:11.180 --> 08:24:14.180
I'll pass, I've been meant to do it in that one.

08:24:15.180 --> 08:24:17.180
Mmm.

08:24:18.180 --> 08:24:20.180
Yeah? Yeah.

08:24:20.180 --> 08:24:23.180
That's the best counter in location I pay out.

08:24:24.180 --> 08:24:26.180
Mmm.

08:24:26.180 --> 08:24:28.180
You're shooting both of them.

08:24:31.180 --> 08:24:33.180
The same thing is, you actually could have won three times

08:24:33.180 --> 08:24:35.180
if you weren't placing tails randomly.

08:24:36.180 --> 08:24:39.180
I'm trying to think ahead of my moves, okay?

08:24:39.180 --> 08:24:41.180
It's hard.

08:24:44.180 --> 08:24:46.180
Oh my god, this is delicious.

08:24:48.180 --> 08:24:50.180
Reeflings, do you want me to baby barge you?

08:24:50.180 --> 08:24:52.180
Because I'll do it.

08:24:53.180 --> 08:24:55.180
Mmm.

08:25:04.180 --> 08:25:07.180
Uh, don't like the look of that.

08:25:07.180 --> 08:25:10.180
I'm getting nervous, I'm getting shaky.

08:25:14.180 --> 08:25:16.180
I'm trying to do that then.

08:25:16.180 --> 08:25:17.180
Get ready.

08:25:17.180 --> 08:25:18.180
Oh no!

08:25:18.180 --> 08:25:19.180
No!

08:25:19.180 --> 08:25:21.180
No!

08:25:22.180 --> 08:25:24.180
Why do I not see it?

08:25:24.180 --> 08:25:26.180
Why do I not see it coming?

08:25:27.180 --> 08:25:29.180
Why do I not see it coming?

08:25:29.180 --> 08:25:31.180
I'm being so for real right now.

08:25:31.180 --> 08:25:32.180
Right.

08:25:32.180 --> 08:25:34.180
The next one I am not losing.

08:25:34.180 --> 08:25:35.180
I don't care what happens.

08:25:35.180 --> 08:25:37.180
I am not losing.

08:25:38.180 --> 08:25:40.180
I am tryharding so much.

08:25:41.180 --> 08:25:43.180
I am not losing this one.

08:25:43.180 --> 08:25:45.180
I'm so serious.

08:25:46.180 --> 08:25:48.180
Are we bimbo max?

08:25:48.180 --> 08:25:49.180
I literally don't see it.

08:25:49.180 --> 08:25:51.180
Right, you've placed it in the middle.

08:25:51.180 --> 08:25:53.180
That's fine.

08:25:53.180 --> 08:25:54.180
Is it?

08:25:54.180 --> 08:25:55.180
I don't know.

08:25:55.180 --> 08:25:57.180
We'll place it next to you then.

08:25:59.180 --> 08:26:01.180
That's fine.

08:26:01.180 --> 08:26:04.180
So I'll counter you from doing four in a row on the bottom.

08:26:05.180 --> 08:26:07.180
And then I'll do this.

08:26:09.180 --> 08:26:11.180
Alright.

08:26:11.180 --> 08:26:13.180
One, two, three.

08:26:13.180 --> 08:26:15.180
So you can't go anywhere there.

08:26:15.180 --> 08:26:17.180
But I can progress by going here.

08:26:20.180 --> 08:26:22.180
And that's fine.

08:26:22.180 --> 08:26:24.180
You're allowed to do that.

08:26:26.180 --> 08:26:28.180
Right.

08:26:29.180 --> 08:26:31.180
Did I do it?

08:26:32.180 --> 08:26:34.180
Oh, wait.

08:26:35.180 --> 08:26:37.180
I thought I won there.

08:26:37.180 --> 08:26:38.180
Wait.

08:26:39.180 --> 08:26:41.180
Wait, why did I not win there?

08:26:42.180 --> 08:26:44.180
Like this?

08:26:44.180 --> 08:26:46.180
Did I counter them by going that way?

08:26:49.180 --> 08:26:51.180
I will redeem myself.

08:26:51.180 --> 08:26:53.180
Oh no, right.

08:26:53.180 --> 08:26:55.180
One, two, three, four.

08:26:55.180 --> 08:26:57.180
So drop it here.

08:27:00.180 --> 08:27:02.180
I'm tryharding.

08:27:02.180 --> 08:27:04.180
I'm looking.

08:27:07.180 --> 08:27:09.180
Alright, if you're there,

08:27:09.180 --> 08:27:11.180
one, two, three, four.

08:27:11.180 --> 08:27:13.180
Fuck you.

08:27:13.180 --> 08:27:15.180
Wait.

08:27:16.180 --> 08:27:18.180
One, two, three, four.

08:27:21.180 --> 08:27:23.180
What are you trying to do?

08:27:23.180 --> 08:27:25.180
One, two, three, here.

08:27:25.180 --> 08:27:27.180
So I can't put it in this column.

08:27:30.180 --> 08:27:32.180
Right, you've put it up there,

08:27:32.180 --> 08:27:34.180
which is fine.

08:27:34.180 --> 08:27:36.180
Oh, fuck you.

08:27:36.180 --> 08:27:38.180
You've blocked me.

08:27:38.180 --> 08:27:40.180
Uh.

08:27:40.180 --> 08:27:42.180
Wait.

08:27:43.180 --> 08:27:45.180
So what happens now?

08:27:46.180 --> 08:27:47.180
What did that do?

08:27:47.180 --> 08:27:48.180
No, you're getting blocked.

08:27:48.180 --> 08:27:49.180
I don't know what you're doing,

08:27:49.180 --> 08:27:51.180
but don't do it.

08:27:53.180 --> 08:27:54.180
I don't know what you're doing there,

08:27:54.180 --> 08:27:56.180
but don't do it.

08:27:58.180 --> 08:28:00.180
What are you doing over here now?

08:28:03.180 --> 08:28:05.180
That's fine.

08:28:07.180 --> 08:28:09.180
Whoa!

08:28:09.180 --> 08:28:11.180
Whoa!

08:28:11.180 --> 08:28:12.180
Get wrecked.

08:28:12.180 --> 08:28:13.180
Get wrecked.

08:28:13.180 --> 08:28:15.180
Get absolutely wrecked.

08:28:15.180 --> 08:28:16.180
Oh my God, I did it.

08:28:16.180 --> 08:28:18.180
I was like trying so hard.

08:28:18.180 --> 08:28:20.180
I was trying to see what you were trying to do.

08:28:20.180 --> 08:28:22.180
I was playing two characters at once on the board.

08:28:22.180 --> 08:28:24.180
Oh, we did it.

08:28:25.180 --> 08:28:27.180
I have lower connect for IQ.

08:28:29.180 --> 08:28:31.180
Okay, let's try again.

08:28:31.180 --> 08:28:33.180
Hold on, let me take a bite of my food.

08:28:33.180 --> 08:28:35.180
Oh my God, I had to try so hard for that.

08:28:36.180 --> 08:28:38.180
Mmm.

08:28:39.180 --> 08:28:41.180
Okay.

08:28:43.180 --> 08:28:45.180
Oh my God, that was so hard.

08:28:46.180 --> 08:28:48.180
I don't know how people play logic games all the time.

08:28:48.180 --> 08:28:50.180
I feel like my brain just gets so tired.

08:28:50.180 --> 08:28:52.180
I'm like, oh, I'm done.

08:28:52.180 --> 08:28:54.180
Mmm.

08:28:56.180 --> 08:28:58.180
Mmm-hmm.

08:29:00.180 --> 08:29:02.180
Mmm-hmm.

08:29:03.180 --> 08:29:04.180
Here, here, here.

08:29:04.180 --> 08:29:06.180
Oh, shit.

08:29:06.180 --> 08:29:08.180
Oh, this is not looking good.

08:29:10.180 --> 08:29:12.180
Mmm-hmm.

08:29:15.180 --> 08:29:16.180
Am I going to throw?

08:29:16.180 --> 08:29:18.180
I don't know what you're trying to do.

08:29:19.180 --> 08:29:21.180
What are you trying to do?

08:29:23.180 --> 08:29:24.180
Don't feel bad.

08:29:24.180 --> 08:29:26.180
My brain is still at nice capacity.

08:29:26.180 --> 08:29:27.180
Oh, no, what did you do?

08:29:27.180 --> 08:29:28.180
I wasn't paying attention.

08:29:28.180 --> 08:29:29.180
Right, you get blocked.

08:29:36.180 --> 08:29:37.180
Mmm-hmm.

08:29:38.180 --> 08:29:39.180
Oh, fuck!

08:29:39.180 --> 08:29:42.180
Oh, for fuck's sake, it seems so hard.

08:29:43.180 --> 08:29:47.180
Bro, when you go back to cooking swordfish, this is so hard.

08:29:47.180 --> 08:29:48.180
How?

08:29:49.180 --> 08:29:50.180
I never see it.

08:29:50.180 --> 08:29:53.180
I, like, physically can't see it coming.

08:29:54.180 --> 08:29:55.180
Until I hear the...

08:29:59.180 --> 08:30:00.180
Bro.

08:30:00.180 --> 08:30:02.180
Girlfriend is pouty and frustrated and upset.

08:30:02.180 --> 08:30:04.180
She's got destroyed and fucking...

08:30:04.180 --> 08:30:06.180
Not even just destroyed and runescaped.

08:30:06.180 --> 08:30:09.180
Destroyed and runescaped, like, side player gate.

08:30:09.180 --> 08:30:11.180
Oh, God, I'm first. Sorry.

08:30:12.180 --> 08:30:14.180
Wait, how did that double down there?

08:30:14.180 --> 08:30:15.180
I didn't even need to...

08:30:15.180 --> 08:30:16.180
Oh, fine, I'm tripling down.

08:30:22.180 --> 08:30:23.180
Mmm-hmm.

08:30:29.180 --> 08:30:32.180
Oh, so I'm choking on my burrito in anger.

08:30:34.180 --> 08:30:36.180
Because I'm so bad at this game.

08:30:36.180 --> 08:30:37.180
Mmm-hmm.

08:30:39.180 --> 08:30:40.180
I don't know.

08:30:43.180 --> 08:30:46.180
No, you're gonna win!

08:30:47.180 --> 08:30:49.180
Oh, look how freaking low my score is!

08:30:49.180 --> 08:30:50.180
I started on a third.

08:30:50.180 --> 08:30:52.180
Oh, my God, you're so good at winning.

08:30:52.180 --> 08:30:53.180
What are you doing?

08:30:54.180 --> 08:30:56.180
One, two, three, two, two.

08:30:57.180 --> 08:30:59.180
I don't know what I'm doing, either, to be honest.

08:31:01.180 --> 08:31:02.180
Ah, Saishayuma.

08:31:03.180 --> 08:31:05.180
Ah, Saishayuma.

08:31:12.180 --> 08:31:14.180
Ow, what are you doing?

08:31:15.180 --> 08:31:16.180
Stop.

08:31:17.180 --> 08:31:18.180
You're stressing me out.

08:31:18.180 --> 08:31:19.180
This refland's gonna win.

08:31:19.180 --> 08:31:21.180
They're, like, genuinely stressing me out.

08:31:22.180 --> 08:31:23.180
Right, get blocked.

08:31:25.180 --> 08:31:27.180
No! Oh, my God!

08:31:27.180 --> 08:31:28.180
I hate...

08:31:28.180 --> 08:31:29.180
Wait, we're going...

08:31:29.180 --> 08:31:30.180
No, I'm sorry.

08:31:30.180 --> 08:31:31.180
We're going back to Edgeville.

08:31:31.180 --> 08:31:32.180
I'm actually fucking done.

08:31:32.180 --> 08:31:33.180
I'm actually...

08:31:33.180 --> 08:31:34.180
I'm done.

08:31:34.180 --> 08:31:36.180
We're going back to Edgeville.

08:31:36.180 --> 08:31:37.180
I'm not even kidding.

08:31:37.180 --> 08:31:38.180
I'm not even joking.

08:31:38.180 --> 08:31:39.180
We're going back to Edgeville.

08:31:39.180 --> 08:31:40.180
I'm so done.

08:31:40.180 --> 08:31:41.180
I'm so done.

08:31:43.180 --> 08:31:45.180
We're going back to Edgeville to cook

08:31:45.180 --> 08:31:46.180
freaking swordfish.

08:31:46.180 --> 08:31:48.180
This is so hard.

08:31:49.180 --> 08:31:50.180
This is so hard.

08:31:50.180 --> 08:31:52.180
It's a surprise exam.

08:31:52.180 --> 08:31:53.180
Get to fuck.

08:31:53.180 --> 08:31:55.180
I've got the lowest IQ in the...

08:31:56.180 --> 08:31:58.180
Freaking lower than room temperature water.

08:31:58.180 --> 08:31:59.180
Oh, my God.

08:32:01.180 --> 08:32:03.180
Why is that game so hard?

08:32:04.180 --> 08:32:05.180
Freaking...

08:32:06.180 --> 08:32:08.180
To no one's surprise,

08:32:08.180 --> 08:32:10.180
the 1v1 chess stream has been delayed

08:32:10.180 --> 08:32:12.180
due to the fact that I'm probably

08:32:12.180 --> 08:32:14.180
gonna have to actually watch some chess tutorials

08:32:14.180 --> 08:32:16.180
because I don't know how the rules work.

08:32:18.180 --> 08:32:20.180
If she starts speaking...

08:32:20.180 --> 08:32:21.180
If she starts speaking German,

08:32:21.180 --> 08:32:22.180
she should really stop playing.

08:32:22.180 --> 08:32:23.180
I respect your dedication

08:32:23.180 --> 08:32:25.180
not to apply mind bullets to them

08:32:25.180 --> 08:32:27.180
to gain a victory.

08:32:27.180 --> 08:32:28.180
Is that what it should have done?

08:32:28.180 --> 08:32:29.180
I should have done.

08:32:29.180 --> 08:32:31.180
I should just start taking the bikini off

08:32:31.180 --> 08:32:32.180
and all that.

08:32:33.180 --> 08:32:35.180
I was so hard for no reason.

08:32:36.180 --> 08:32:37.180
Take the random event.

08:32:37.180 --> 08:32:38.180
Oh, is it good?

08:32:38.180 --> 08:32:39.180
Sorry.

08:32:41.180 --> 08:32:42.180
Hello.

08:32:42.180 --> 08:32:43.180
Yeah, sure.

08:32:43.180 --> 08:32:44.180
I'll find soon an exam.

08:32:44.180 --> 08:32:45.180
Right.

08:32:45.180 --> 08:32:46.180
What's my...

08:32:46.180 --> 08:32:47.180
What is this?

08:32:47.180 --> 08:32:48.180
Ah, it's your skullfish.

08:32:48.180 --> 08:32:49.180
You've been slacking in your studies.

08:32:49.180 --> 08:32:50.180
It's time for an exam.

08:32:50.180 --> 08:32:51.180
In some case, Johnny,

08:32:51.180 --> 08:32:53.180
once gay players are built different.

08:32:53.180 --> 08:32:54.180
Bro, they are.

08:32:54.180 --> 08:32:55.180
Thank you for the tip, boy.

08:32:55.180 --> 08:32:57.180
They literally are, though.

08:32:58.180 --> 08:32:59.180
There are two types of questions.

08:32:59.180 --> 08:33:01.180
One requires you to find the next object

08:33:01.180 --> 08:33:02.180
in a pattern.

08:33:02.180 --> 08:33:03.180
And the second,

08:33:03.180 --> 08:33:05.180
I will present you with 15 cards and a hint.

08:33:06.180 --> 08:33:07.180
That's so specific.

08:33:07.180 --> 08:33:08.180
What are we doing?

08:33:08.180 --> 08:33:09.180
What comes next?

08:33:09.180 --> 08:33:11.180
Shoes, shoes, shoes.

08:33:11.180 --> 08:33:12.180
Shoes.

08:33:12.180 --> 08:33:13.180
That's correct.

08:33:13.180 --> 08:33:14.180
Next question.

08:33:14.180 --> 08:33:16.180
Pick the object that should come next to a pattern.

08:33:18.180 --> 08:33:19.180
A banana,

08:33:19.180 --> 08:33:20.180
a dookie,

08:33:20.180 --> 08:33:21.180
a pineapple,

08:33:21.180 --> 08:33:23.180
a slice of watermelon.

08:33:24.180 --> 08:33:25.180
Finally,

08:33:25.180 --> 08:33:27.180
a apple that uses her brains.

08:33:27.180 --> 08:33:28.180
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

08:33:28.180 --> 08:33:29.180
Sure, sure.

08:33:30.180 --> 08:33:32.180
These are gardening tools,

08:33:32.180 --> 08:33:33.180
so we need a rake.

08:33:34.180 --> 08:33:35.180
To the exit.

08:33:35.180 --> 08:33:36.180
Okay, we did it.

08:33:36.180 --> 08:33:37.180
We did it.

08:33:37.180 --> 08:33:38.180
Please don't fail.

08:33:38.180 --> 08:33:39.180
Imagine if I did this.

08:33:43.180 --> 08:33:44.180
Oh, my God.

08:33:44.180 --> 08:33:45.180
Did you hear that?

08:33:45.180 --> 08:33:47.180
The burrito just kissed me

08:33:47.180 --> 08:33:48.180
from the way I bit it.

08:33:48.180 --> 08:33:50.180
What's the book of knowledge to do?

08:33:50.180 --> 08:33:51.180
Ah!

08:33:51.180 --> 08:33:52.180
Fishing?

08:33:52.180 --> 08:33:53.180
It took him.

08:33:56.180 --> 08:33:57.180
Wait.

08:33:57.180 --> 08:33:59.180
Oh, that wasn't cooking.

08:33:59.180 --> 08:34:00.180
Oh, my God.

08:34:02.180 --> 08:34:03.180
Oh, my God.

08:34:04.180 --> 08:34:06.180
Just when you think I couldn't get dumber,

08:34:06.180 --> 08:34:09.180
I just put XP into firemaking

08:34:09.180 --> 08:34:11.180
instead of cooking.

08:34:11.180 --> 08:34:12.180
Bruv.

08:34:12.180 --> 08:34:14.180
Can this get any worse?

08:34:15.180 --> 08:34:17.180
I don't think it's any more obvious

08:34:17.180 --> 08:34:18.180
how low my IQ is.

08:34:18.180 --> 08:34:19.180
Holy crap.

08:34:19.180 --> 08:34:20.180
It's even a miracle I can breathe

08:34:20.180 --> 08:34:22.180
and eat at the same time.

08:34:23.180 --> 08:34:26.180
Oh, my God.

08:34:26.180 --> 08:34:27.180
Reefling's about to get jealous

08:34:27.180 --> 08:34:29.180
over a burrito for real, for real.

08:34:29.180 --> 08:34:30.180
Did you not hear?

08:34:30.180 --> 08:34:31.180
Did it come up in the make?

08:34:31.180 --> 08:34:32.180
It literally went...

08:34:33.180 --> 08:34:35.180
when I bit into the burrito.

08:34:37.180 --> 08:34:38.180
It's fine, you're a fish.

08:34:38.180 --> 08:34:40.180
You are the goofiest of goobers.

08:34:40.180 --> 08:34:41.180
We love you immensely.

08:34:41.180 --> 08:34:44.180
The firemaking will warm up your IQ.

08:34:45.180 --> 08:34:47.180
Small brain after all.

08:34:47.180 --> 08:34:49.180
That was so hard.

08:34:49.180 --> 08:34:50.180
I don't know how to play this.

08:34:50.180 --> 08:34:51.180
Ah, jealous of a piece of fish.

08:34:53.180 --> 08:34:55.180
Shawnee out here looking like process.

08:34:55.180 --> 08:34:56.180
Bruv.

08:34:56.180 --> 08:34:58.180
That was terrible.

08:34:58.180 --> 08:35:00.180
I literally rage quit.

08:35:00.180 --> 08:35:02.180
I'm like, no, I need to walk away.

08:35:02.180 --> 08:35:03.180
Thank you very much, Reefling,

08:35:03.180 --> 08:35:05.180
for making the fire.

08:35:05.180 --> 08:35:07.180
Any arsonists?

08:35:07.180 --> 08:35:09.180
Absolutely.

08:35:09.180 --> 08:35:10.180
Let me keep eating this burrito

08:35:10.180 --> 08:35:11.180
before it gets cold.

08:35:16.180 --> 08:35:18.180
Are you squidding me right now?

08:35:19.180 --> 08:35:21.180
Strowme, we're hungry.

08:35:21.180 --> 08:35:23.180
Can you get back in the kitchen?

08:35:23.180 --> 08:35:25.180
I mean, level in cooking.

08:35:25.180 --> 08:35:27.180
Love you, you goofball.

08:35:27.180 --> 08:35:29.180
Thank you, anonymous.

08:35:29.180 --> 08:35:30.180
Love you too, little Reefling.

08:35:30.180 --> 08:35:32.180
Yes, I will feed you well and good.

08:35:33.180 --> 08:35:34.180
That was...

08:35:34.180 --> 08:35:35.180
Thank you for the tip.

08:35:35.180 --> 08:35:37.180
Oh my god, my hand's covered in sauce.

08:35:42.180 --> 08:35:43.180
See, I'm not afraid to, like,

08:35:43.180 --> 08:35:45.180
sauce off after Reefling.

08:35:45.180 --> 08:35:47.180
As I choke on a piece of corn,

08:35:47.180 --> 08:35:49.180
I can't talk and frickin...

08:35:50.180 --> 08:35:52.180
...eat at the same time.

08:35:58.180 --> 08:36:00.180
Oh my god.

08:36:01.180 --> 08:36:03.180
That was so hard for no reason.

08:36:03.180 --> 08:36:04.180
I've never played Connect 4 like that

08:36:04.180 --> 08:36:06.180
in a very long time.

08:36:06.180 --> 08:36:08.180
Bruv, I suck at anything logic-based.

08:36:10.180 --> 08:36:12.180
Oh my god.

08:36:13.180 --> 08:36:15.180
Is there Connect 4 championships?

08:36:16.180 --> 08:36:18.180
Could you imagine?

08:36:18.180 --> 08:36:20.180
You know how you get a rank in chess?

08:36:22.180 --> 08:36:23.180
Can you imagine?

08:36:23.180 --> 08:36:25.180
It was fun content, though.

08:36:25.180 --> 08:36:27.180
Strowme gets absolutely destroyed by...

08:36:30.180 --> 08:36:32.180
...viewers live on stream.

08:36:32.180 --> 08:36:34.180
Rage quiz.

08:36:35.180 --> 08:36:36.180
Mm-hmm.

08:36:42.180 --> 08:36:43.180
Wow.

08:36:44.180 --> 08:36:46.180
I almost finished this brutal.

08:36:46.180 --> 08:36:47.180
My hand is covered.

08:36:47.180 --> 08:36:49.180
I don't think I have a napkin.

08:36:50.180 --> 08:36:52.180
Reeflings, do you want to come lick my fingers

08:36:52.180 --> 08:36:54.180
and call me KFC?

08:36:55.180 --> 08:36:57.180
Cause I'm finger-licking good.

08:36:57.180 --> 08:36:58.180
Oh, hold on.

08:36:58.180 --> 08:37:00.180
Cause I'm finger-licking good!

08:37:02.180 --> 08:37:03.180
Thank you.

08:37:09.180 --> 08:37:12.180
I have to lean over with my other hand to do that.

08:37:13.180 --> 08:37:15.180
It's like a call offering.

08:37:17.180 --> 08:37:20.180
I want KFC not to imagine that almost.

08:37:23.180 --> 08:37:25.180
Cuttlefish pounded from four angles.

08:37:25.180 --> 08:37:27.180
Yeah, that could be the title of the stream

08:37:27.180 --> 08:37:29.180
cause I played that frickin...

08:37:31.180 --> 08:37:33.180
Connect 4 more like...

08:37:33.180 --> 08:37:35.180
Connect my shite.

08:37:43.180 --> 08:37:45.180
Right, we'll finish the...

08:37:46.180 --> 08:37:47.180
We'll finish eating.

08:37:47.180 --> 08:37:49.180
And we'll finish the swordfish.

08:37:51.180 --> 08:37:54.180
Snippets, 20-minute warning for Mercy.

08:37:56.180 --> 08:37:58.180
Azura, I think, is still going to be live on stream.

08:37:58.180 --> 08:38:00.180
Cause stream is a six-hour game.

08:38:06.180 --> 08:38:07.180
If you're going to do emotes,

08:38:07.180 --> 08:38:09.180
you should do questionable ones like this.

08:38:09.180 --> 08:38:11.180
Is that questionable?

08:38:11.180 --> 08:38:13.180
Oh, maybe if you're like under the table.

08:38:13.180 --> 08:38:15.180
Then, yeah.

08:38:16.180 --> 08:38:18.180
Yeah, Azura is still live.

08:38:18.180 --> 08:38:19.180
Okay, that's good.

08:38:21.180 --> 08:38:22.180
I'm eating.

08:38:25.180 --> 08:38:27.180
Architect bros winning.

08:38:31.180 --> 08:38:33.180
And do you want to know the calorie count

08:38:33.180 --> 08:38:35.180
of my meal, Architect bros?

08:38:38.180 --> 08:38:40.180
Just the thought of my stomach expanding

08:38:40.180 --> 08:38:42.180
with all that food and sticking out,

08:38:42.180 --> 08:38:44.180
going from a flat stomach

08:38:44.180 --> 08:38:46.180
to all big and engorged...

08:38:47.180 --> 08:38:48.180
Architect.

08:38:51.180 --> 08:38:52.180
I'm sorry.

08:38:53.180 --> 08:38:55.180
I don't know why I'm just talking about that.

08:38:56.180 --> 08:38:58.180
No, Architect bros.

08:38:59.180 --> 08:39:01.180
I hate it now, I'm teasing you.

08:39:01.180 --> 08:39:03.180
I'm teasing your pickles.

08:39:08.180 --> 08:39:09.180
I do not judge.

08:39:11.180 --> 08:39:13.180
Don't be sorry, we enjoy it.

08:39:13.180 --> 08:39:14.180
I should get a hydration.

08:39:14.180 --> 08:39:16.180
Well, I'll say hydration as if it's not cool over.

08:39:24.180 --> 08:39:25.180
Big burp.

08:39:26.180 --> 08:39:27.180
Maybe a big burp.

08:39:28.180 --> 08:39:29.180
We burp, we burp.

08:39:29.180 --> 08:39:30.180
Not much force.

08:39:30.180 --> 08:39:31.180
Not much fist room.

08:39:31.180 --> 08:39:32.180
Dah, behind that burp.

08:39:34.180 --> 08:39:35.180
Pause.

08:39:36.180 --> 08:39:38.180
Yeah, we're now munching on the leftover chips

08:39:38.180 --> 08:39:39.180
because I finished my burrito.

08:39:39.180 --> 08:39:41.180
Some of the filling of the burrito spilled out,

08:39:41.180 --> 08:39:42.180
so I'm like...

08:39:42.180 --> 08:39:44.180
I'm using my chip as a vessel

08:39:44.180 --> 08:39:46.180
to spoon it into my mouth.

08:39:47.180 --> 08:39:49.180
Not the in-game rate in a mubbock.

08:39:55.180 --> 08:39:57.180
Strawny feeds everyone equally.

08:39:57.180 --> 08:39:59.180
That's why she's queen for it.

08:40:02.180 --> 08:40:04.180
Your interests are my fascination.

08:40:04.180 --> 08:40:06.180
Your curiosities are my challenge.

08:40:07.180 --> 08:40:09.180
Chicken or beef?

08:40:11.180 --> 08:40:12.180
Chicken.

08:40:14.180 --> 08:40:16.180
I struggle to eat a lot around me

08:40:16.180 --> 08:40:18.180
and then I wonder why I'm so ill.

08:40:19.180 --> 08:40:21.180
It's literally got all the iron in it that I need.

08:40:24.180 --> 08:40:26.180
I'm always a chicken boy.

08:40:26.180 --> 08:40:28.180
I'm a chicken boy mubbock.

08:40:31.180 --> 08:40:33.180
Do you know some Gomez person?

08:40:33.180 --> 08:40:34.180
No, sorry.

08:40:38.180 --> 08:40:39.180
Am I supposed to?

08:40:41.180 --> 08:40:42.180
I love vision.

08:40:42.180 --> 08:40:44.180
I think I've ever had vision before.

08:40:45.180 --> 08:40:46.180
I'm heading to sleep at 6am.

08:40:46.180 --> 08:40:47.180
Oh my goodness.

08:40:47.180 --> 08:40:48.180
Please rest well.

08:40:48.180 --> 08:40:50.180
Is that 6am America?

08:40:50.180 --> 08:40:51.180
Must be.

08:40:53.180 --> 08:40:56.180
Because it's like midnight in the UK, roughly.

08:41:00.180 --> 08:41:01.180
Are you good?

08:41:01.180 --> 08:41:02.180
Oops.

08:41:03.180 --> 08:41:04.180
Who goes there?

08:41:04.180 --> 08:41:05.180
I identify yourself.

08:41:06.180 --> 08:41:08.180
No, it's only 8pm on the west coast.

08:41:08.180 --> 08:41:09.180
Oh!

08:41:10.180 --> 08:41:11.180
Sorry, I can't stop burping.

08:41:11.180 --> 08:41:12.180
Good night, EU.

08:41:13.180 --> 08:41:15.180
Thank you for absolutely reckoning

08:41:15.180 --> 08:41:17.180
decking me on Kinect 4.

08:41:18.180 --> 08:41:19.180
I live in Turkey.

08:41:19.180 --> 08:41:20.180
Oh, okay, okay, okay.

08:41:21.180 --> 08:41:22.180
It's 6am.

08:41:23.180 --> 08:41:25.180
It's 11pm for me and I'm Midwest.

08:41:25.180 --> 08:41:26.180
Yee-haw!

08:41:26.180 --> 08:41:28.180
Nah, it's 4am in the UK.

08:41:33.180 --> 08:41:35.180
Sorry, I'm still really enjoying my food

08:41:35.180 --> 08:41:37.180
so I apologise if I'm not talking too much.

08:41:38.180 --> 08:41:40.180
I'm trying to eat as fast as I can.

08:41:45.180 --> 08:41:46.180
I keep doing that.

08:41:46.180 --> 08:41:48.180
I'm just going to click on the booth.

08:41:50.180 --> 08:41:51.180
Let's go to the booth.

08:41:53.180 --> 08:41:55.180
Am I dumb, but can I ask what munkah means?

08:41:55.180 --> 08:41:56.180
Munkah.

08:41:56.180 --> 08:41:59.180
Munkah S is a twitch emote

08:41:59.180 --> 08:42:01.180
where Pappy looks really stressed out

08:42:01.180 --> 08:42:04.180
and he's like, oh, like, like, nervous.

08:42:04.180 --> 08:42:07.180
And I reduce it to munkah.

08:42:07.180 --> 08:42:08.180
Munkah!

08:42:10.180 --> 08:42:13.180
But if you type in munkah S on Google

08:42:13.180 --> 08:42:15.180
it'll just show you what Pappy looks like.

08:42:15.180 --> 08:42:16.180
He's all stressed out.

08:42:19.180 --> 08:42:21.180
Almost 4am and I'm slowly losing it.

08:42:21.180 --> 08:42:23.180
Please go to sleep!

08:42:24.180 --> 08:42:25.180
Oh my god.

08:42:26.180 --> 08:42:28.180
Please don't worry about going to sleep.

08:42:28.180 --> 08:42:30.180
Like, seriously, I don't want you guys, like,

08:42:30.180 --> 08:42:32.180
risking your health to watch me stream.

08:42:32.180 --> 08:42:34.180
Like, I'm literally stuffing my face.

08:42:34.180 --> 08:42:35.180
I just got wrecked and connect 4

08:42:35.180 --> 08:42:37.180
and I'm going straight back to cooking.

08:42:37.180 --> 08:42:39.180
Like, you ain't missing out on too much, I assure you.

08:42:42.180 --> 08:42:44.180
Time for a hypnotic slumber.

08:42:54.180 --> 08:42:56.180
Sleep is for the weakest weekend now.

08:42:58.180 --> 08:43:00.180
Sleep equals exp wasted.

08:43:02.180 --> 08:43:04.180
Oh my god, really, really close to level.

08:43:04.180 --> 08:43:05.180
I'm not next batch.

08:43:05.180 --> 08:43:07.180
I don't know what level.

08:43:07.180 --> 08:43:08.180
40.

08:43:08.180 --> 08:43:10.180
Eh, 74?

08:43:18.180 --> 08:43:20.180
I hate arching on mobile.

08:43:23.180 --> 08:43:26.180
See, we've got like a billion different things to click to do or anything.

08:43:27.180 --> 08:43:28.180
And...

08:43:29.180 --> 08:43:30.180
Ah!

08:43:30.180 --> 08:43:31.180
76!

08:43:31.180 --> 08:43:34.180
Oh my god, how much did Wine Boosters?

08:43:35.180 --> 08:43:37.180
I thought we were selling like 72.

08:43:41.180 --> 08:43:45.180
Wine is faster, but I want to use all the fish that the reeflings gave me.

08:43:46.180 --> 08:43:48.180
Because I don't want it to go to waste.

08:43:48.180 --> 08:43:51.180
I don't want it to be, like, rotting in my bank.

08:43:56.180 --> 08:43:59.180
Four more levels and you can cook sharks.

08:44:05.180 --> 08:44:07.180
I have a good night.

08:44:07.180 --> 08:44:09.180
Please rest well.

08:44:10.180 --> 08:44:13.180
Wine got me 72 at 65 in, like, under an hour.

08:44:17.180 --> 08:44:19.180
Only power...

08:44:20.180 --> 08:44:25.180
Only power to bring me back to this Godforsaken game is like cute fish!

08:44:27.180 --> 08:44:30.180
It's a good game, but...

08:44:30.180 --> 08:44:35.180
If you've got stuff to do, it's not the easiest game to, like, keep up the excitement.

08:44:35.180 --> 08:44:40.180
I think RuneScape, I would say, is probably similar to, like, people say,

08:44:40.180 --> 08:44:44.180
like, when you start up a Minecraft server, um...

08:44:44.180 --> 08:44:50.180
Pardon me, and you play for, like, a week and then you all get burnt out and never go on it again type thing.

08:44:50.180 --> 08:44:53.180
Wine got you from 69 to 70.

08:44:53.180 --> 08:44:55.180
It feels good, man.

08:44:57.180 --> 08:44:59.180
Nooo!

08:44:59.180 --> 08:45:01.180
Not cooking and doing your species.

08:45:01.180 --> 08:45:05.180
There's plenty to go around in the RuneScape economy.

08:45:05.180 --> 08:45:08.180
More than enough, actually.

08:45:08.180 --> 08:45:12.180
In fact, the waters are so infested with shark, they're everywhere.

08:45:14.180 --> 08:45:15.180
Thank you.

08:45:15.180 --> 08:45:17.180
Uh, boi- boi!

08:45:18.180 --> 08:45:21.180
Can I say thank you and I'll miss for the other tips?

08:45:22.180 --> 08:45:27.180
Love you, you're good for all. Love you too, love everything.

08:45:27.180 --> 08:45:30.180
Or love you too, uh, Anonymous.

08:45:30.180 --> 08:45:34.180
I don't know if I'm supposed to guess, I'm supposed to call you Anonymous or everything.

08:45:39.180 --> 08:45:41.180
A rainbow fish!

08:45:44.180 --> 08:45:45.180
Okay.

08:45:45.180 --> 08:45:49.180
I've almost finished eating, I'm so sorry if it feels like I've been chewing for ages.

08:45:49.180 --> 08:45:51.180
I was too busy getting- oh!

08:45:51.180 --> 08:45:53.180
That's how many times have I done that now?

08:45:53.180 --> 08:45:55.180
No, stop eating!

08:45:55.180 --> 08:45:57.180
What are you doing?

08:45:58.180 --> 08:46:00.180
Jeez, Louise woman.

08:46:03.180 --> 08:46:04.180
Okay.

08:46:04.180 --> 08:46:06.180
We've almost finished...

08:46:06.180 --> 08:46:08.180
the...

08:46:09.180 --> 08:46:11.180
the fishy.

08:46:11.180 --> 08:46:14.180
Oh my god, sorry, I can't think I'm just too busy eating.

08:46:14.180 --> 08:46:18.180
I've almost finished eating, I promise I'll finish eating soon.

08:46:19.180 --> 08:46:21.180
How did you take so long to eat?

08:46:24.180 --> 08:46:27.180
Walked into an eater's room, thank goodness I'm not late.

08:46:27.180 --> 08:46:30.180
I'm gonna have her.

08:46:31.180 --> 08:46:34.180
For the architect bros, this one's for you.

08:46:34.180 --> 08:46:38.180
I order two meals because I have the second meal the next day,

08:46:38.180 --> 08:46:42.180
so tomorrow I'll be eating my next meal.

08:46:42.180 --> 08:46:45.180
So I'm gonna go put it in the fridge, in the-

08:46:45.180 --> 08:46:48.180
and wash my hands because they're covered in grease.

08:46:48.180 --> 08:46:50.180
They're covered.

08:46:53.180 --> 08:46:55.180
She knows about that.

08:46:55.180 --> 08:46:58.180
So, when Azura got released,

08:46:58.180 --> 08:47:00.180
I read up a little bit and people were like,

08:47:00.180 --> 08:47:02.180
oh my god, architect chocolate, and I'm like,

08:47:02.180 --> 08:47:04.180
wait, I thought you were-

08:47:04.180 --> 08:47:06.180
and I was like reading, I'm like,

08:47:06.180 --> 08:47:08.180
oh okay, right, I get it now.

08:47:08.180 --> 08:47:11.180
Why architect is such a random word for it though?

08:47:13.180 --> 08:47:16.180
I still don't get the origin, but hey ho.

08:47:16.180 --> 08:47:18.180
Anyway, I'm gonna very quickly wash my hands

08:47:18.180 --> 08:47:21.180
because they're covered in freaking grease from the burrito.

08:47:21.180 --> 08:47:24.180
That was absolutely inhaling and getting rolled on.

08:47:24.180 --> 08:47:28.180
I'll be literally a millisecond, I don't need to do anything special.

08:47:46.180 --> 08:47:48.180
...

08:47:48.180 --> 08:47:50.180
...

08:48:12.180 --> 08:48:14.180

08:48:14.180 --> 08:48:16.180

08:48:16.180 --> 08:48:18.180

08:48:18.180 --> 08:48:20.180

08:48:20.180 --> 08:48:22.180

08:48:22.180 --> 08:48:24.180

08:48:24.180 --> 08:48:26.180

08:48:26.180 --> 08:48:28.180

08:48:28.180 --> 08:48:30.180

08:48:30.180 --> 08:48:32.180

08:48:32.180 --> 08:48:34.180

08:48:34.180 --> 08:48:36.180

08:48:36.180 --> 08:48:38.180
...

08:48:38.180 --> 08:48:40.180
...

08:48:40.180 --> 08:48:42.180
I've just stood up and I'm aware of her fill my bladder

08:48:42.180 --> 08:48:44.180
because I'm gonna go pee.

08:48:44.180 --> 08:48:46.180
...

08:48:46.180 --> 08:48:48.180

08:49:32.180 --> 08:49:34.180

08:49:34.180 --> 08:49:36.180
...

08:49:36.180 --> 08:49:38.180
...

08:50:08.180 --> 08:50:31.420
I have six set, where does my head start, I've lost it, okay, I've just sat down and

08:50:31.420 --> 08:50:44.100
I need a two, damn you, I'm gonna do it, I'm gonna do it, I'm gonna sneeze actually, okay,

08:50:44.100 --> 08:50:55.500
what a wake up, okay, you're done, am I getting sick, I better not be, I am not

08:50:55.500 --> 08:51:00.100
getting sick when I've not even done a month full of streaming yet, I do not tell

08:51:00.340 --> 08:51:08.780
tolerate any sickness, I haven't even done it a full month yet, I'm getting sick, damn you, the

08:51:08.780 --> 08:51:24.900
taskmasker, for me, no not for me, for any, maybe better streaming hours would help you,

08:51:25.420 --> 08:51:31.740
what, you mean don't do 12 hours naturally, what are you talking about refling, don't say

08:51:31.740 --> 08:51:39.100
such nonsense, are you trying to upset me refling, you're trying to make me feel it's

08:51:39.100 --> 08:51:47.300
because you left us, okay, I won't feel sick anymore, you're laughing but I have separation

08:51:47.300 --> 08:51:57.100
anxiety with you guys, it's been getting better but I feel an immense amount of anxiety at the,

08:51:57.100 --> 08:52:05.420
before I click go live and then it goes away when I am live, I'm not sure what that means,

08:52:05.420 --> 08:52:14.420
I mean I had it last time, wink wink, and then it subsided and it was back again so I don't

08:52:14.500 --> 08:52:19.700
have to plan as it's going to subside over my body so sooner, we love you too, hey,

08:52:19.700 --> 08:52:25.540
scrawny, when are the Elden Ring Streams, when the DLC releases, you've been playing for a while,

08:52:25.540 --> 08:52:33.620
consider taking a break, do you insult me Jagex, do you think me some prepubescent child that can't

08:52:33.620 --> 08:52:44.140
handle a little gaming session, Jagex please do not dare interrupt my flow, do you ever

08:52:44.340 --> 08:52:50.740
get anxiety when it comes to ending streams, I get nervous about ending the stream because

08:52:50.740 --> 08:52:55.100
of what I'm going to say and I know that seems silly because it's like well you say the same

08:52:55.100 --> 08:53:01.020
every time like I say like I'll see you tomorrow, like I love you reflings, a few kisses on that

08:53:01.020 --> 08:53:07.140
but I get worried about it and I don't know why, I think it's because I am saying goodbye and it's

08:53:07.140 --> 08:53:15.220
like I won't see you until the next time I'm up, you know, and too much of a grimoire you somehow

08:53:15.220 --> 08:53:26.340
groomed yourself, hear a veal or you don't grimoire, what a slogan to have for a, every time I do

08:53:26.340 --> 08:53:30.900
that, what a slogan to have for a visa reasons that, I can't believe I said that out loud with my

08:53:30.980 --> 08:53:39.540
fulche, ain't that true though, yeah, oh when I was lurking someone mentioned that they didn't

08:53:39.540 --> 08:53:44.500
realize we both have a nicotine patch on us because we're addicted to each other, it's not

08:53:44.500 --> 08:53:49.460
for the reflings that are addicted to each other, no, refling and strongy aren't addicted to each

08:53:49.460 --> 08:53:57.460
other, I can always ramble and procrastinate ending streaming calls, those are so awkward doing so,

08:53:57.460 --> 08:54:04.100
mmm, well like when we reached the 10 hour board mark on that other stream, I can't even remember

08:54:04.100 --> 08:54:10.580
what it was, the entire ending got caught but I was like trying to say so much all at once just

08:54:10.580 --> 08:54:16.900
because like I wanted to, you know, and I wasn't expected to be groomed but I'm glad you did,

08:54:16.900 --> 08:54:20.580
oh that sounds terrible when you write that out in a sentence, I'm gonna be honest, it makes me

08:54:20.580 --> 08:54:32.580
sound like Chris Hansen, take a seat moment, yeah, kind of true though, I think pre-stream

08:54:32.580 --> 08:54:38.820
anxiety is normal, you're talking to an auditorium worth of people, I actually don't get nervous to

08:54:38.820 --> 08:54:48.900
stream in that sense, it doesn't, I don't look at the numbers like I don't actually know, it's not

08:54:48.900 --> 08:54:57.060
like on display for me, it's just me and reflings playing multiplayer game and that's it, like that's

08:54:57.060 --> 08:55:03.700
what it is, it's not like I'm nervous because I'm gonna have to go perform, I don't have any kind of

08:55:03.700 --> 08:55:10.500
imposter syndrome, I don't have any kind of like I'm not good enough, I just like straight up have

08:55:10.500 --> 08:55:20.980
separation anxiety and that's it pretty much, like I don't get nervous to stream, I don't get like oh

08:55:20.980 --> 08:55:29.140
my god what happens if they don't like it, no, I'm just like just getting nervous, I'm like oh god

08:55:29.140 --> 08:55:36.420
I don't feel well, like I feel sick, like my stomach feels ill sometimes, but like I've started

08:55:36.420 --> 08:55:41.220
up streams and I've said to you like oh guys it's not gonna be like a long stream today and then it

08:55:41.220 --> 08:55:47.060
ends up turning into like six hours type thing um when I only had the intention of two because I

08:55:47.060 --> 08:55:51.780
wasn't feeling well, but as soon as I start streaming it's like I get a second burst of wind,

08:55:52.420 --> 08:55:58.580
like I'm super energetic, I'm super engaging, like I'm having like so much fun, I'm enjoying myself

08:55:58.580 --> 08:56:05.300
like right now we're looking at pixels over and over again putting, pardon me for being so rude,

08:56:05.300 --> 08:56:10.340
it was not me, it was my food and like I'm having so much fun, like look at all the reeflings that

08:56:10.340 --> 08:56:17.700
are in the bank with me right now, like all of us goofing off and like uh Mack, mackerel or maker,

08:56:17.700 --> 08:56:29.940
Mack maker, thank you for coming to Memba, um it's just like, it's like me with social anxiety,

08:56:29.940 --> 08:56:34.660
I don't want to go out but when I'm out it's fun, yeah it's kind of like getting over the hump

08:56:34.660 --> 08:56:44.660
if you will and and like I especially enjoy my endurance streams, like I kind of spoke on it the

08:56:44.660 --> 08:56:52.740
other day, um one time I was having a really bad time and reeflings were just hanging out with me

08:56:52.740 --> 08:56:59.460
and this isn't now, this isn't now, this is like way in the past, um and we played a song and it's

08:56:59.460 --> 08:57:05.860
called Mr Kitty, um and it's like a really depressive song or kind of slow tempo song

08:57:06.980 --> 08:57:12.500
and I heard it and I was listening to it and it made me feel a certain way, it made me feel

08:57:12.500 --> 08:57:17.940
quite negative, like it was quite a depressive song, Mr Kitty After Dark, yes that was the song

08:57:18.820 --> 08:57:23.780
and I listened to it and I typed and I said is this what you guys feel like all the time?

08:57:24.740 --> 08:57:30.500
because of the way the song had like resonated with me, it felt as rough as I had felt in that

08:57:30.500 --> 08:57:34.340
moment because I was feeling rough because you know stuff was going on behind the scene, um

08:57:36.020 --> 08:57:44.900
and it kind of like made me realize like if me hanging out, having a carry-on, rambling,

08:57:44.900 --> 08:57:50.020
coming up with all these like silly little ASMR ideas and like all these collab ideas and elaborate

08:57:50.020 --> 08:57:56.580
stuff and all of that and like it makes you not feel like that when I stream, like how blessed

08:57:56.580 --> 08:58:06.260
and how lucky like we're on this timeline, like you know you can feel, I don't know, like accepted

08:58:06.260 --> 08:58:12.020
to just like do your own thing, like I always say the phrase you can be at arm's length, you can be

08:58:12.020 --> 08:58:16.980
attached at the hip, you can be on my head type thing, it's completely up to you Viflin, um

08:58:17.940 --> 08:58:22.340
but I do remember that night because I was like you guys feel like that, like when

08:58:23.380 --> 08:58:26.660
just in general like you have like such a rough time and then you come

08:58:27.620 --> 08:58:33.860
on stream and like you come and you you make me laugh, you make me giggle, we tell terrible puns

08:58:33.860 --> 08:58:40.900
while going like and we're just hanging out type thing, you know it's like even when like you feel

08:58:40.900 --> 08:58:46.500
so rough you're so willing to like come to me, be so accepting of me, like say such nice things to me

08:58:46.500 --> 08:58:54.260
and encourage me to do stuff and all of that and it's just like it's such like a nice way like

08:58:54.260 --> 08:59:01.300
hopefully, I hope it's like a positive feedback loop where you make me giggle, I make you giggle

08:59:01.300 --> 08:59:08.180
and like we just have a fun time for what it's worth and sometimes you need a song like that

08:59:08.180 --> 08:59:13.380
to marinate in your thought, yeah like I don't listen to what I consider like sad music in the

08:59:13.700 --> 08:59:22.100
dumps music or emotional music, like I listen to Atarashi Gako and like Tokyo Calling, Tokyo Calling

08:59:22.100 --> 08:59:25.940
um like I listen to Hatsune Miku, I don't even know what's happening half the time when I listen

08:59:25.940 --> 08:59:31.140
to Hatsune Miku but like the music's so upbeat, it's so up-pop, like I never listen to anything

08:59:31.140 --> 08:59:38.100
depressive, like like goofy, like literally I'm listening to a Dutch song, I have no idea what's

08:59:38.180 --> 08:59:45.940
being said, other than the lyrics suck ma, type thing, you know, I love that thing

08:59:48.420 --> 08:59:54.500
thanks for the stream strong, I'm off to watch Mercy, yes any snippets, Mercy Modiste is live

08:59:54.500 --> 09:00:00.980
and she is playing with my willy, she's not, maybe in another life

09:00:01.700 --> 09:00:02.900
um

09:00:06.580 --> 09:00:09.700
right hold on let me check, Hatsune Miku has become a legendary figure

09:00:11.140 --> 09:00:17.540
of Mickey and homework, right hold on what is Mercy playing, is Azura still live, Azura is

09:00:17.540 --> 09:00:27.060
still live, she's playing Shrey live, Mercy Modiste, Mercy is playing Harvester part two, I already

09:00:27.060 --> 09:00:32.900
knew that because I said that earlier and yeah I forgot, see you brain, see you brain

09:00:39.940 --> 09:00:48.340
I got a comment on the new the ASMR video and someone's like why is this being recommended to me

09:00:48.900 --> 09:00:54.420
hey hey hey hey hey you can't resist the ASMR

09:00:59.620 --> 09:01:03.140
the most I felt like that after dark was when that um

09:01:05.060 --> 09:01:11.540
when you go in member to a members world, I don't know if we need to do a members world this stream

09:01:11.540 --> 09:01:19.460
and maybe next stream we're doing members world unfortunately although wine isn't members is it

09:01:20.580 --> 09:01:23.940
no maybe not, I don't know if we're just doing members all the way to the end

09:01:25.460 --> 09:01:28.420
if we're doing wines all the way to the end, people say wines is faster

09:01:29.860 --> 09:01:35.380
literally get algorithmed, honestly what did you miss I stuffed my face and then

09:01:36.180 --> 09:01:43.220
uh let uh let the architect bros know I've got them in the back of my mind

09:01:48.020 --> 09:01:51.220
um yeah hold on, hold on

09:01:53.300 --> 09:01:57.140
the begging ASMR is peak ASMR honestly, wait what does it say now

09:01:57.860 --> 09:02:06.420
uh it's still going, oh my god is that 23,000 views, that doesn't make sense

09:02:07.940 --> 09:02:14.020
architect bros eating good just like strongy honestly what does it mean architect architect

09:02:14.020 --> 09:02:24.180
is a terminology used for people who enjoy bigger body types or eating type of content

09:02:25.140 --> 09:02:34.260
or gaining weight type of content but there's different levels to it um so Azura delays

09:02:34.260 --> 09:02:39.780
body type because she's not like the default skinny malinky I keep opening this freaking

09:02:39.780 --> 09:02:48.420
collection box um VTuber so she would get referred to as someone for the architect bros

09:02:49.380 --> 09:02:54.500
look at all the swordfish they're so purple

09:02:56.340 --> 09:02:57.380
they're so purple

09:02:59.620 --> 09:03:05.220
uh architect bros specifically vtubers I think

09:03:06.900 --> 09:03:14.500
she shuffled herself in the ink yes uh again Azura Duly is live with a stray

09:03:15.460 --> 09:03:21.540
hopefully her pc doesn't explode um and merci mondice is playing harvester part two

09:03:21.540 --> 09:03:27.060
which she never told me there was a part two because I'm getting a highlight reel of part one

09:03:27.940 --> 09:03:31.700
which isn't going to make any sense if I don't get a highlight reel of part two

09:03:35.700 --> 09:03:39.700
I love strongy I love reeflings what you're gonna do about it huh you're gonna kiss me on my

09:03:39.940 --> 09:03:47.220
lips you know let me hold your hand actually I have something to ask the reeflings are

09:03:48.100 --> 09:03:54.340
you guys are like small enough to fit in the palm of my hand basically do you guys like that

09:03:54.340 --> 09:04:03.060
you're smaller than me or would you like a mascot that's like bigger oh my god why am I struggling

09:04:03.140 --> 09:04:10.580
so hard with this bank system um like you're so nice and tame yeah smaller than you is better

09:04:11.300 --> 09:04:17.780
what is my size um I don't even think I have a reference artwork I can use that isn't tall

09:04:17.780 --> 09:04:25.300
spreading small is nice yes you're if you didn't know secret hidden lore for the reeflings your

09:04:25.300 --> 09:04:29.780
tentacles can grow as long as you like so you can interact with things as much as you need

09:04:30.420 --> 09:04:34.900
um you have very very long tentacles if you so desire but they're just nice and cute and

09:04:34.900 --> 09:04:41.300
stacked together whilst you are in oh my god the crisscross salmon the salmon are going upstream

09:04:41.300 --> 09:04:52.100
look they're going upstream what we are growers not sure it's exactly hmm almost like a previous

09:04:52.180 --> 09:04:59.220
lore strange it small means when you cuddle as we feel you every yeah I can put you in my mouth

09:04:59.220 --> 09:05:07.300
in my tummy we can go explore strony in the first thing

09:05:08.900 --> 09:05:12.020
share a blindfold reeflings but let your tentacles do what they want

09:05:14.500 --> 09:05:16.580
bank boost I'm not going to mess up this time

09:05:22.500 --> 09:05:28.660
oh wow how do I do the fire huh okay there we go

09:05:30.500 --> 09:05:37.460
strony subtly mentioned war oh I don't mind it no okay I like giant tests like war um

09:05:40.580 --> 09:05:44.340
what else do I like um

09:05:44.740 --> 09:05:50.580
I'm trying to think of other things that are considered like not regular

09:05:53.700 --> 09:06:05.780
hmm spelunking me no I can't escape that word it's like mongolian frozing in it's everywhere

09:06:05.780 --> 09:06:12.340
it's everywhere can't escape it no spelunking what does it even mean

09:06:14.420 --> 09:06:20.340
you can't even tell me it's not related to the bedroom spelunking I can't wait to go spelunking

09:06:20.340 --> 09:06:31.060
with the reeflings oh I can't wait until we go into a tight dark damp cave and spelunk together

09:06:31.060 --> 09:06:35.140
like bro whoever named spelunking spelunking you knew exactly what you did

09:06:35.140 --> 09:06:43.380
I mean cave exploring yeah literally spelunking

09:06:44.420 --> 09:06:49.860
you've ever heard such a more ridiculous word how dare they make such a word

09:06:51.300 --> 09:06:56.260
oh my god you're still doing absolutely wakey wakey sleepyhead

09:06:58.180 --> 09:07:03.220

09:07:11.460 --> 09:07:18.740
anyone who do need to sleep please don't worry we are literally just going for another three hours

09:07:18.740 --> 09:07:26.420
and then uh we'll redirect into a streamer I don't know who I don't even know who's not online

09:07:26.420 --> 09:07:32.180
normally at this time but we will find a vtuber that is live that we can redirect into

09:07:32.900 --> 09:07:39.300
the euro cup fit ball is on the new all right okay right good luck uh I am down for some spelunking

09:07:39.300 --> 09:07:47.140
right now uh plunging is another fun one plunging please do not plunge me that's not abysmal

09:07:49.700 --> 09:07:55.700
spelunking in the cave of a giant earth I don't know how to how far to go with the giant earth

09:07:55.700 --> 09:08:00.500
and the zero I might not make her do the weird side of things I might do the weird side of things

09:08:00.900 --> 09:08:04.820
but yeah

09:08:10.020 --> 09:08:12.580
no plo no plunging not even a little

09:08:14.420 --> 09:08:21.940
you can plug me up whoa wait hold on I was like so direct my brain was like oh this will this is

09:08:21.940 --> 09:08:27.380
fine this is clearly beating around the bush nope no it's not it's absolutely not I just straight

09:08:27.380 --> 09:08:36.180
upset what what I uh sorry you know actually I can tell you something that was really terrible

09:08:37.300 --> 09:08:45.300
so if all the development issues hadn't occurred I actually fully was going to

09:08:48.660 --> 09:08:51.700
are you squinting me uh hold on I don't know what you think

09:08:51.780 --> 09:08:54.420
giant s for content one day totally

09:08:56.660 --> 09:09:01.220
um I'm freaking happy to make it anonymous it doesn't bother me like I like it I don't

09:09:01.220 --> 09:09:07.380
mind at all um I don't like the you die ones I don't like that I like the ones where you just

09:09:07.380 --> 09:09:12.100
kind of appear on the other end all fine and good maybe a bit moody because you accidentally

09:09:12.100 --> 09:09:18.420
got swallowed or something like that um she's letting the intrusive thoughts went honestly though

09:09:19.140 --> 09:09:24.180
this is terrible so if all the development issues didn't happen all the girls were posting

09:09:24.180 --> 09:09:29.380
like all these audios on twitter and I was like oh I should probably do one as well but like

09:09:29.380 --> 09:09:36.820
after debut and I thought wouldn't it not be really terrible if I may or may not have been

09:09:36.820 --> 09:09:38.820
um

09:09:39.780 --> 09:09:50.020
plug uh during like debut and after and then once the stream ended I would go record and like

09:09:50.020 --> 09:09:56.660
do something with it and then finish and then post it and you know so that was my idea but

09:09:56.660 --> 09:10:03.140
obviously that all crumbled apart thanks to development issues um but yeah I thought it would

09:10:03.220 --> 09:10:10.500
be pretty good but that would have been amazing unfortunately it's not possible it's not possible

09:10:11.540 --> 09:10:16.660
um there was so many developmental issues in time and I could absolutely strangle some people but

09:10:16.660 --> 09:10:22.820
that's just what happens like literally um oh sorry there was a refling that messaged me that

09:10:22.820 --> 09:10:29.700
apologized for criticizing the company for saying like oh it'd be better if the girls could make their

09:10:29.700 --> 09:10:36.900
designs please don't feel bad I absolutely completely get where you come from um just for

09:10:37.540 --> 09:10:44.260
how do I keep doing that I'll give up um please don't feel bad about saying that like you said

09:10:44.260 --> 09:10:50.660
it in a nice way we had some negative criticism that was like oh premade model actually one of

09:10:50.660 --> 09:10:59.540
the most bizarre criticisms we got um was what was it it was like oh they don't even have talents

09:10:59.620 --> 09:11:05.780
ready when we opened up auditions and it was like yeah you're fucking Egypt we didn't have talents so

09:11:05.780 --> 09:11:10.340
we're opening auditions like every other Vtuber agency but when we do it it's bad but when

09:11:10.340 --> 09:11:16.180
everyone else does it it's fine and that was like what it was the most bizarre thing I had ever read

09:11:16.180 --> 09:11:26.100
honestly um we have plenty of time for future fun literally opened up auditions and someone was like

09:11:26.100 --> 09:11:31.540
what's she be 2.0 look like this I mean she was getting an update to our model I don't know how

09:11:31.540 --> 09:11:35.860
much she said I'm not gonna say anything if she doesn't say anything I'm not gonna say anything

09:11:35.860 --> 09:11:43.220
hey thank you for the tip as well anonymous sorry I almost forget to thank you um I won't say anything

09:11:43.220 --> 09:11:50.420
until she be said something but yeah ghetto outfit she said outfit

09:11:54.420 --> 09:11:59.460
right I'll I'll leave it at that if she's not directly said what it is I'm not gonna say

09:12:00.500 --> 09:12:01.460
she said outfit

09:12:05.380 --> 09:12:12.420
we don't have workers because we're not open yet many baffled honestly it was bizarre like I remember

09:12:12.500 --> 09:12:19.140
reading it actually there's a reflin it must have been a reflin it must have been a reflin

09:12:19.140 --> 09:12:24.660
because you made me he haul my arse off and I can remember the quote because I used to quote it

09:12:24.660 --> 09:12:29.380
because someone defended the agency they must I think they're a reflin or possibly just someone

09:12:29.380 --> 09:12:34.500
who's enthusiastic about the girls in general so someone criticized the company because they were

09:12:34.500 --> 09:12:41.540
like oh another agency where you have to give up your model to work with them and get their

09:12:41.700 --> 09:12:47.060
premade models or whatever and then someone commented and replied to them and there was like

09:12:47.780 --> 09:12:54.020
no one wants your ugliest sin model like that was to the quote your ugly as sin model oh

09:12:55.300 --> 09:13:01.540
I wish I could have interacted with it because it made me he haul so badly

09:13:01.540 --> 09:13:09.780
is that no one wants your ugly as sin model oh my god I literally was like getting so close

09:13:09.780 --> 09:13:15.780
to printing that out and putting it on my fridge because it was just so hilarious to me like it was

09:13:15.780 --> 09:13:31.380
so hilarious um like I just oh my god um uh vin miss vin san vin san vin sin vin sin

09:13:32.340 --> 09:13:37.060
vin sin thank you for becoming a member that took me so long to figure out I'm so sorry

09:13:37.140 --> 09:13:42.820
no not sin sister it was just the terminology the guy used because someone was like oh I don't

09:13:42.820 --> 09:13:47.460
want to give up my model type thing and I don't want this I don't want that like basically complaining

09:13:47.460 --> 09:13:51.300
about the agency and it was like rub one you've not even applied two you're not interested so

09:13:51.300 --> 09:13:57.460
three shut the fuck up and then some reflin or just someone who was a good fan come swiping in

09:13:57.460 --> 09:14:03.140
and replies what I was basically thinking no one wants your ugliest sin model and I'm like

09:14:03.860 --> 09:14:10.340
it's so good it's so funny anyway so you made my day whoever whoever like came

09:14:10.340 --> 09:14:16.340
sweeping under to defend the agency you have made my day um hellscape thank you for becoming a

09:14:16.340 --> 09:14:23.460
member I appreciate it the membership stream start next week uh you've got plenty uh it's a bit warm

09:14:23.460 --> 09:14:28.980
not gonna lie a bit hot in here yeah a bit bit sweaty out here surprised the bank hasn't caught

09:14:28.980 --> 09:14:35.620
on fire honestly um I forgive her she's tired and forgot how to read oh no what did I miss me

09:14:36.180 --> 09:14:42.580
oh what are you yapping about scrawny is she be cooking so I think she has allured to something

09:14:42.580 --> 09:14:47.780
which I'm more than happy for her to um but I don't think she's fully said what it is and I don't

09:14:47.780 --> 09:14:52.100
want to ruin it because it's quite a nice thing I think it's quite a nice thing and it's like the

09:14:52.100 --> 09:15:01.940
most basic common courtesy thing um allured she'd be allured to it there were some abysmally uh stupid

09:15:01.940 --> 09:15:11.220
to take from a flume it's just the way the guy typed the message I just constantly remember the

09:15:11.220 --> 09:15:20.580
phrase ugliest sin model I like oh my god talking about like catching straight like oh my god I don't

09:15:20.580 --> 09:15:29.300
think I could recover if someone was like your ugliest sin model ah oh my god love it love it love

09:15:29.300 --> 09:15:40.020
it love it um mommy you have broken youtube we are going for 6.1 subs oh my god the video what is

09:15:40.020 --> 09:15:46.500
the video honestly that funny I'm like I'm second guessing myself I'm like what's the video truly that

09:15:46.500 --> 09:15:50.180
entertaining like I was just kind of saying please a lot by the end of it and started like

09:15:50.180 --> 09:15:56.180
breathing in the mic really weird I only know one agency that lets their talents pick their models

09:15:56.180 --> 09:16:05.220
literally I've only heard one other agency do it as well um but I'm quite happy for the girls like

09:16:05.220 --> 09:16:09.540
to design their 2.0 like Emmy designed her 2.0 like I'm more than happy if she wants if that

09:16:09.540 --> 09:16:14.900
makes her happier and all that then jeez what am I gonna fucking say about it nothing oh guys as

09:16:14.900 --> 09:16:21.060
long as the girls are happy they're happy um I made mommy ink herself has my whole life been a

09:16:21.060 --> 09:16:28.500
mistake is this peak content for you from uh also the amount of people that could not read oh I felt

09:16:28.500 --> 09:16:38.100
so bad actually we had one Japanese girl um apply and I felt so bad because she had such a lovely

09:16:38.100 --> 09:16:44.740
voice but she could hardly speak any English and I was like it's not gonna work it's such a shame

09:16:45.460 --> 09:16:53.700
she had worked for a previous agency um and I think google translate was helping her through

09:16:53.700 --> 09:17:00.340
the page and she inquired on the website and I felt so bad being like bro you can't speak English

09:17:00.340 --> 09:17:07.220
I can't have you there is actually a Russian person that reached out as well she was like I know you

09:17:07.220 --> 09:17:12.980
I know your agency's English but can I stream in Russian and have a Russian audience and I'm like

09:17:13.620 --> 09:17:18.980
ah yes let us the English VTuber agency come out with talents that where I can't even like

09:17:18.980 --> 09:17:25.540
moderate what you're doing or saying like what some folk had like don't get me wrong we're lenient

09:17:25.540 --> 09:17:32.900
but we do have to say like that's not even possible like what you're asking for isn't even possible

09:17:34.100 --> 09:17:40.660
um that was a shame I loved Amy's 2.0 design I'm glad I'm glad I think she had a lot of fun

09:17:40.660 --> 09:17:52.660
designing her 2.0 um so yeah how good was good as application what good is still a thingy

09:17:52.660 --> 09:17:57.380
oh you want to trade with me hold on let me put my swordfish away I'll trade with you what's up

09:17:58.260 --> 09:18:08.980
what's up low leaflin maybe oh it's so what is this are these donuts to put around your

09:18:09.380 --> 09:18:15.460
disc of returning disc of returning yellow boots yellow gloves what

09:18:17.860 --> 09:18:20.980
what have you given me what does it look like activate

09:18:22.580 --> 09:18:30.260
you can only enter thordor's black hole from the dwarven mains are you sitting literally I

09:18:30.260 --> 09:18:36.340
thought this is a weebie ring as well are you giving me your weebie ring am I putting shoes on

09:18:37.300 --> 09:18:45.460
okay I got shoes on I've got gloves on oh now I look like I really work I think it's a helpful

09:18:45.460 --> 09:18:51.940
tool that will come in handy later that's so ominous this is a helpful tool that'll help you later

09:18:51.940 --> 09:18:55.940
what do you mean that's so ominous what am I supposed to do about that

09:18:56.500 --> 09:19:08.340
I I get you miss 100% of the shots but some people just don't get it it was a shame like I felt

09:19:08.340 --> 09:19:15.140
really bad for the Japanese girl she was nothing but polite well mannered um and like obviously I

09:19:15.140 --> 09:19:19.860
can't say too much of the message but basically she'd worked in another agency before it didn't work

09:19:19.860 --> 09:19:26.180
out and and she was like really excited at the prospect and she already had all the experience

09:19:26.180 --> 09:19:33.540
type thing but she just couldn't speak English and I can't be like given lead script examples where

09:19:33.540 --> 09:19:38.020
she mimics what I'm seeing because then she's gonna end up just sounding like me type thing when it

09:19:38.020 --> 09:19:43.220
comes to trying to mix it was a shame it was a shame because it would have been a very interesting mix

09:19:44.180 --> 09:19:53.380
you can stack donuts on it Japanese branch when no there will be no spin-offs

09:19:54.500 --> 09:20:04.420
absolutely no spin-offs at viola um I am I am three gents and I am done I have nothing else to

09:20:04.420 --> 09:20:11.940
produce or give to this beautiful world I will give my daughters um my gen one my gen two my

09:20:11.940 --> 09:20:19.140
gen three and I am done I cannot handle anymore I am I'm at capacity there is too much lights off

09:20:19.140 --> 09:20:23.620
a plappening happen I can't keep up with you as refluence I can't keep up with you as

09:20:24.260 --> 09:20:30.260
and someone was worried about a male branch I assure you that male branch idea is dead in the

09:20:30.260 --> 09:20:39.060
ditch I am not even touching it with a ten foot pole um someone asked I did get a few inquiries

09:20:39.620 --> 09:20:46.180
on the website saying are you interested in doing a safer work branch um the answer is no

09:20:47.620 --> 09:20:53.300
I don't mean to sound so blunt with that but the answer is no you might as well go to any other

09:20:53.300 --> 09:20:58.260
agency go apply to any other agency if you're if you're interested in the safer work the reason

09:20:58.260 --> 09:21:02.260
why you don't get such a good cut in other agencies is because they're greedy cons but that's okay

09:21:02.260 --> 09:21:08.260
though because you know is what it is no point in no point in beating around the bush no point in

09:21:08.260 --> 09:21:16.340
beating around the bush um safer work branch kind of defeats the purpose literally like at that

09:21:16.340 --> 09:21:27.140
point might as well just start like a whole different agency and all that jazz um but I am done I have

09:21:27.140 --> 09:21:36.420
experienced it it's been fun um Veeler is my child and so are my daughters and the reeflings

09:21:36.420 --> 09:21:41.380
are the father and I'm also pregnant with the reeflings for that asmr and I forgot to commission

09:21:41.380 --> 09:21:47.540
that art I've still not done it I don't do it shouldn't Veeler too electric boogaloo but

09:21:47.540 --> 09:21:55.620
strongy with enough power you can reignite even a dying star no latin american branch no I cannot

09:21:55.620 --> 09:22:04.980
do any uh alternative language speaking branches because I don't speak the language and I don't

09:22:04.980 --> 09:22:13.140
have any trusted advisors that I could overwhelm with the amount of work it takes um like the split

09:22:13.140 --> 09:22:19.300
couldn't be as high if I needed someone on call 24 7 to translate what these girls are trying to

09:22:20.260 --> 09:22:25.860
like it's just it's not possible it's not possible or it's not possible for me possible for other

09:22:25.860 --> 09:22:31.780
agencies not yourself out but after three gents I am done I am helping the girls achieve their

09:22:31.780 --> 09:22:38.660
dreams as much as possible at that point I have no interested in trying to infinitely expand and

09:22:38.660 --> 09:22:44.660
have a billion talents out of once and no that's just no it's so disrespectful as well to the

09:22:45.540 --> 09:22:50.820
to the girls um just being like oh but we're already throwing out the next gen some mailers

09:22:52.340 --> 09:22:56.580

before

09:26:19.860 --> 09:26:22.820
I'm going to sleep

09:26:32.820 --> 09:26:37.220
you're gonna have to use hypnosis wait I don't want to sleep though

09:26:37.300 --> 09:26:41.780
but it's good for your health but you can't do it it's evil

09:26:43.620 --> 09:26:48.260
fuck you you tangled me I tangled you that was an ASMR that was just me man

09:26:49.620 --> 09:26:50.900
singing a little lullaby

09:26:53.460 --> 09:26:59.380
strongy was streaming when I came to bed now I wake up and I continue continue watching hell yeah

09:27:01.620 --> 09:27:06.340
all of a sudden I feel super hyper well after the lullaby my favorite saying apologies if I

09:27:06.340 --> 09:27:11.460
bit you it oh as if I can read that

09:27:20.420 --> 09:27:25.060
they really said loose lips sink ships I can't believe it you almost got me

09:27:25.940 --> 09:27:28.900
it was lovely though oh your whispers can tingle alone

09:27:29.460 --> 09:27:36.980
and I bet you like my whispers I start saying you just get ready to go to sleep

09:27:36.980 --> 09:27:46.020
yeah normally these ones I'd stay up go to sleep or just play summer escape a little without

09:27:51.700 --> 09:27:55.620
the hypnosis then just made me imagine you gengar

09:27:56.580 --> 09:28:01.700
yeah gengar the hypnosis

09:28:05.060 --> 09:28:11.300
might be the lullaby or the two kilograms of cocaína just no no I'll sleep when mom

09:28:11.300 --> 09:28:19.220
sleeps just so lovely thank you mom oh thank you uh when the stream ends

09:28:19.220 --> 09:28:22.340
emi and ac's memberships are gonna go

09:28:23.940 --> 09:28:30.420
live because I'm gonna put them live because I'm such a good little streamer

09:28:32.660 --> 09:28:38.100
such a good little streamer streamer no this doesn't make me a streamer

09:28:39.700 --> 09:28:46.980
manager no I'm a little manager I just do the intern work and it keeps the stress off of them

09:28:46.980 --> 09:28:52.420
as long as the girl's stress levels are low and I will I will be very happy

09:28:59.620 --> 09:29:04.500
the point is to consume hypno content so much it conditions you it will work eventually

09:29:04.500 --> 09:29:08.980
taking over a decade from when I became interested until I felt my first vision

09:29:09.460 --> 09:29:13.220
mmm it was drowsy

09:29:15.060 --> 09:29:26.500
yes I will my bedtime is 5 p.m. actually it's 1 p.m. right now and we've still got another what

09:29:26.500 --> 09:29:36.660
two and a half hours yeah so then that would take me to what four p.m so I have one hour

09:29:36.660 --> 09:29:44.820
basically to do all the stuff that I'm supposed to do and then I pass out and then when I wake up

09:29:44.820 --> 09:29:51.940
I prepare for stream with a cup of honey tea and then I open up crash bandicoot warped and make

09:29:51.940 --> 09:29:58.820
sure you guys can hear it and see it and then we go again and I believe tomorrow is eight hour

09:29:58.820 --> 09:30:05.140
stream it's not endurance to finish the game it's eight hours would it be mean to let you know

09:30:05.140 --> 09:30:17.460
you're 10% of the way to 99 what 10% of the way

09:30:20.500 --> 09:30:24.420
I thought I could get it finished this month I don't think so

09:30:24.820 --> 09:30:35.860
10% there oh yay oh no do you want to know the amount of exp required

09:30:37.540 --> 09:30:45.780
it's 13 million oh I'm 10% of the way that so every million is like I guess

09:30:46.340 --> 09:30:58.100
what 1.3 percent every million wait every million is 10.3 percent surely that's how it works is that

09:30:58.100 --> 09:31:09.700
how math works break it down into chunks um 98 to 99 is like 1.2 million oh my god

09:31:10.020 --> 09:31:15.780
peanut the forest is here you should be able to do it

09:31:18.020 --> 09:31:24.900
every 1.3 million is 10 percent okay so we're just over 10 percent now okay that's not bad

09:31:24.900 --> 09:31:32.740
we'll finish the sword fish I think we can finish the sword fish before the end of the stream and then

09:31:33.700 --> 09:31:42.580
we'll tackle wine I'm going to buy a bunch of wine stuff and we're basically gonna watch a movie

09:31:44.900 --> 09:31:51.380
while we do it so we can all giggle and laugh at movie um I think we'll do John Wick

09:31:52.900 --> 09:31:58.340
this is perfect zatsu content and rambling yeah I did look at marshmallows I don't know

09:31:58.580 --> 09:32:03.220
have many more marshmallows a lot of the marshmallows I can't really read for obvious reason

09:32:03.940 --> 09:32:10.180
because refillings are a little okay let me check if there are any more

09:32:11.380 --> 09:32:17.540
marshmallows oh okay definitely a few more marshmallows hold on let's go uh

09:32:21.220 --> 09:32:24.660
oh no are you guys berating me because I lost four in a row

09:32:28.820 --> 09:32:32.660
uh

09:32:35.860 --> 09:32:42.660
uh I was split between giving my veal or membership uh cherry to emmy or to mercy

09:32:43.300 --> 09:32:47.460
because each of the girls are intense young dairies and don't want their fans to flirt with

09:32:47.460 --> 09:32:52.340
other girls then I remembered all the good times from hanging in your stream and I saw the third

09:32:52.340 --> 09:32:58.900
option you me no you're supposed to support my daughters strongy sometimes during or after

09:32:58.900 --> 09:33:02.980
emmy's membership opening I'm going to make a decision you're a strong prick I won't overlook

09:33:02.980 --> 09:33:10.740
you when deciding refling or or pinpal or snippet whatever one you may be um please always support

09:33:10.740 --> 09:33:17.780
my daughters over me if you can only support one at a time um please pick either daughter if you

09:33:17.780 --> 09:33:23.140
struggle to pick between a daughter pick the design the default design you like the most

09:33:23.780 --> 09:33:28.740
that's the easiest the most simplistic way to do it because your brain will either go I like this

09:33:28.740 --> 09:33:33.300
design the most or I like that oh my god I thought Gimli was in the room there I had a heart attack

09:33:33.300 --> 09:33:38.340
I always get nervous about spiders uh I don't like them um mostly there's a spider like a

09:33:38.340 --> 09:33:47.140
working in the room can we add pictures or videos to marshmallows um you can via cat box um

09:33:48.580 --> 09:33:53.540
if you want to show me something but you have to do the link and you have to make it easy

09:33:54.260 --> 09:33:59.780
just remove the dot and put dot in brackets because if you do it any other way I'm too

09:33:59.780 --> 09:34:04.020
pepega and can't open it off it's literally a logic puzzle to open up a link with when you

09:34:04.020 --> 09:34:09.940
don't give me the link it's okay strongy we'll comfort you after this losses there there

09:34:09.940 --> 09:34:15.620
head pads good girl hey wait didn't did you want us to help with those frustrations

well you do more twitter mosaic responses to the marshmallows yes I've been wanting to do it

09:35:40.020 --> 09:35:46.180
and update it terribly terribly badly for a long time because I really enjoy writing the scenarios

09:35:46.180 --> 09:35:50.740
to you guys like when you guys give me like a little prompt or something and I just take it way

09:35:50.740 --> 09:35:58.420
too far it's my favorite thing to do uh yes I will definitely be doing that again soon it's just

09:35:59.140 --> 09:36:05.220
every I say this every stream as the dust settles and all the little mini side projects get pushed

09:36:05.220 --> 09:36:09.940
out the way then I can start to like really catch up because like whenever I do those two

09:36:09.940 --> 09:36:15.220
other streams I'm catching up and like I'm literally going to the doctors after buckshot

09:36:15.220 --> 09:36:24.740
roulette and then I'll be healing up for a bit um so ASMR with the viewer viewer beats you in a

09:36:24.740 --> 09:36:30.980
board game a bunch till we let you win and then space you time to celebrate the victory honestly

09:36:30.980 --> 09:36:40.660
that's quite funny um you being so silly not very bright and cute at the same time makes me want to

09:36:42.340 --> 09:36:47.860
run and tackle you under the bed and cuddle you I would hug you and roll around under the covers

09:36:47.860 --> 09:36:51.540
and never let you go where's can I explain how much I love you you're my sunshine oh you're my

09:36:51.540 --> 09:37:00.180
sunshine are you playing uh you like when I'm dumb you like when I show how unbelievably

09:37:00.180 --> 09:37:08.740
braindead I am yeah is that what you like sorry but you're being hard locked as my wishy-dus

09:37:10.660 --> 09:37:16.500
we sure do oh allegedly why is it so hard to play freaking connect four

09:37:16.500 --> 09:37:19.940
I don't know why it's so hard

09:37:23.780 --> 09:37:29.540
she be just woke up and said I woke up a bit ago dizzy but wanting to be ravaged okay she

09:37:29.540 --> 09:37:36.740
be she's doing better with her migraine you are more of a mother to me than my own parents and

09:37:36.740 --> 09:37:42.420
I hardly even know you you are welcome well I didn't mean you're welcome like that but um

09:37:42.980 --> 09:37:52.180
um sometimes it's a bit sucky but some people might not necessarily be the best parents

09:37:52.820 --> 09:38:02.580
and sometimes it's easier to just take a deep breath and sigh and say they did the best with

09:38:02.580 --> 09:38:10.980
what they had at the time with what they got and sometimes it's not easy to swallow the truth and

09:38:11.060 --> 09:38:19.780
be like oh that really wasn't as nice because you know when you watch media it's like oh the loving

09:38:19.780 --> 09:38:28.100
parents they they're so supportive they're so this or so that sometimes it's a hard pill to swallow

09:38:28.100 --> 09:38:34.900
to say that you drew an unlucky hand and that might not necessarily mean you don't still share a love

09:38:34.900 --> 09:38:43.460
for your primary caregivers um but there are some phrases in the English language that's like

09:38:43.460 --> 09:38:49.620
the blood of the covenant is thicker than the water of the womb which basically just means the

09:38:49.620 --> 09:38:59.860
connections that you seek out in life that are outside of your family can be just as valid if

09:38:59.860 --> 09:39:06.580
not more loving than family because you don't pick family you don't you don't pick these aspects and

09:39:07.620 --> 09:39:14.740
sometimes it's just easier to it's not easy to swallow the pill but sometimes it's easier to

09:39:14.740 --> 09:39:24.020
just take a deep breath let out a big sigh and be like okay that's just how it is and I hope you're

09:39:24.020 --> 09:39:33.300
doing okay yeah it it sucks but I'm I'm glad um you can feel a degree of motherly love um

09:39:34.500 --> 09:39:41.780
you know I don't think anyone should be embarrassed or uh what's the word kind of like it's only human

09:39:41.780 --> 09:39:52.340
nature to crave um to crave attention to crave love to create to crave these positive reinforcers

09:39:52.900 --> 09:39:58.900
that show that you're a part of a community that you're welcome that you're wanted so don't ever

09:39:58.900 --> 09:40:05.140
you know don't feel embarrassed about that just you know if you're needing kind of a way to to

09:40:05.140 --> 09:40:11.860
put it away uh deep down inside you just let one big sigh and say yeah you know what that's

fucked that situation's fucked but I'm here I'm doing it I'm crushing life you know I've gotten

much more valuable much more important that you look after yourself that you look after whatever

09:44:28.340 --> 09:44:34.900
situation you're in if you have debts you pay them off if you need a sweet treat you indulge in it

09:44:35.380 --> 09:44:42.180
if you you know after work you need to play video games to de-stress make sure your internet

09:44:42.180 --> 09:44:47.940
bill is paid and make sure your electricity bill is paid so you have access to these abilities to

09:44:47.940 --> 09:44:53.780
de-stress to handle the work day to handle the workflow or to handle any life stresses that you

09:44:53.780 --> 09:45:00.740
might be going through um there are just countless situations where people are just going through

09:45:00.740 --> 09:45:06.180
hell on earth on the inside and on the outside they look perfectly fine and you'd have absolutely no

09:45:06.180 --> 09:45:12.980
clue what on earth is going on with them and you know the last thing people want to be dealing with

09:45:12.980 --> 09:45:20.180
is um just this stress that builds and builds and builds and builds and builds until you pop

09:45:20.180 --> 09:45:25.860
people pop people have burnout people have breakdowns like you can pop so easily so make sure

09:45:26.580 --> 09:45:31.140
and you know you're looking after yourself first because at the end of the day you are the most

09:45:31.140 --> 09:45:36.500
important person in your life and that's the fact for everyone's pov right now you are the most

09:45:36.500 --> 09:45:41.940
important person in your life it's the way it works okay and you have to look after yourself

09:45:41.940 --> 09:45:46.420
first you have to make sure that you're feeling good you have to you have to enable yourself

09:45:46.900 --> 09:45:53.860
um to be on your prime like i'll wipe out mazl's hierarchy and needs right now do not think i won't

09:45:53.860 --> 09:45:59.460
do it i will start a psychology lecture right this second i will put my teacher's glasses on

09:45:59.460 --> 09:46:04.100
and it is very important to meet your needs first before you ever try and meet the needs of someone

09:46:04.100 --> 09:46:10.580
else however the exception is that a the stupid sentence i've heard is uh love yourself first

09:46:10.580 --> 09:46:13.860
before you love someone else or something like that shut the fuck up that's the most nonsense

09:46:13.860 --> 09:46:19.140
statement i've ever heard everyone can share the love to any degree and that's my take on that sense

09:46:19.380 --> 09:46:28.260
um you can share love at any point it is simple to share a little bit of love glasses toggle

09:46:28.260 --> 09:46:36.100
no not glasses toggle i never got glasses on my model uh this is helping me procrastinate my

09:46:36.100 --> 09:46:44.900
final oh no that's not good damn i fell asleep for 13 hours and you're still screaming yeah do you

09:46:44.900 --> 09:46:53.380

penicillin because of his beliefs and bob marley that this is love this is love this is love that

09:48:47.140 --> 09:48:52.420

09:49:48.180 --> 09:49:54.500
can be incredibly deadly for some people which is crazy um i'm pretty sure the guy who discovered

09:49:54.500 --> 09:50:00.020
penicillin did it by a complete accident as well which was rather interesting uh it was just a

09:50:00.020 --> 09:50:05.060
complete accident it casually discovers something that saves literally millions of lives can't uh

09:50:05.060 --> 09:50:09.860
you know just get a little casual probably in the billions as time goes on easily a billion lives

09:50:09.860 --> 09:50:17.140

hi strongy hi refling did you know the term architect and features and comes from the irish

09:55:13.940 --> 09:55:24.180
actor pierce raw brosnan who is rumored to have intentionally made his wife gain 100 pounds over

09:55:24.180 --> 09:55:31.300
the course of 20 years the term itself is from a quote made on the architects of peace home page

09:55:31.300 --> 09:55:37.300
a world without wheels it's too terrible to imagine he did not write a book and call it that

09:55:38.820 --> 09:55:44.500
stop is that why he did wait is that from a book he wrote

09:55:47.060 --> 09:55:52.900
oh my god that's outrageous outrageous but really funny

09:55:53.620 --> 09:56:02.980
i like how ic is sweet and emmy is false to the wall insane

09:56:04.820 --> 09:56:07.380
i will continue myself right now go to sleep

09:56:09.140 --> 09:56:15.780
hi strongy your way of gentle talking is one of my favorite triggers i think if you did scott's

09:56:16.500 --> 09:56:26.260
it'd be amazing is there a way to control my well on stream on youtube funny you mentioned that

09:56:37.220 --> 09:56:44.580
have you considered using uh bitmosis to plant suggestions that are wholly positive and affirming

09:56:44.580 --> 09:56:49.300
for the viewer something to encourage them when they're down to give them that little push when

09:56:49.300 --> 09:56:54.980
they're low don't don't want to do the dishes strongy would want you to don't want to cook and

09:56:54.980 --> 09:57:00.020
just want to order out strongy would want you to cook strongy would want me to live my best life

09:57:00.020 --> 09:57:09.540
that's interesting i'm wondering if i could do a putting you to sleep asmr but it's secretly

09:57:09.620 --> 09:57:16.580
hypnosis and then after you've fallen asleep then i would do like that kind of

09:57:17.700 --> 09:57:26.500
in in in planting you've got me thinking a lot of each one you've got me thinking the cogs are

09:57:26.500 --> 09:57:34.820
turning you got me at help you go to sleep yes i think you could do it if you establish triggers

09:57:34.820 --> 09:57:45.220
outside of youtube and use of any issue asi is way more insane i thought emi was uh having fun

09:57:48.500 --> 09:57:53.620
asi's just yeah she doesn't like sharing of g fog sand sands or something that

09:57:53.620 --> 09:58:01.300
has been sent somewhere else she doesn't like that that would be perfect imprinting on me oh my god

09:58:01.540 --> 09:58:02.900
hypnosis is

09:58:08.180 --> 09:58:09.540

10:16:28.820 --> 10:16:29.940

i can't believe her wailed that stream once is it i've not seen it is it bad can you get

10:16:39.220 --> 10:16:44.020
kidney stones from that i went to bed get up and you're still cooking these swordfish

10:16:44.660 --> 10:16:52.260
there was five no there was 10 000 swordfish if i make 10 000 swordfish one stream that means

10:16:52.260 --> 10:17:00.900
i can do 10 000 wine in one stream most likely if not more it means bod is back up actually did

10:17:00.900 --> 10:17:05.140
she cut something out of it i do not know i've been streaming unfortunately

10:17:08.100 --> 10:17:13.700
when i stream all day i have no clue what shenanigans the girls are getting up to in all honors though

10:17:31.380 --> 10:17:35.380
so

10:17:37.620 --> 10:17:45.620
wait that video is still getting recommended to people 24 000 views 2 000 likes i wonder if

10:17:45.620 --> 10:17:54.580
because people are liking it strongy has the best boing boing azura has biggest boing boing

10:17:54.580 --> 10:18:00.260
or do you mean rump i have the biggest rump

10:18:04.740 --> 10:18:10.420
all the perfect all the all the better to smother you with three flights she's out

10:18:10.420 --> 10:18:15.380
pealard anything that ever happened the audio after this it takes a day do you think you'll

10:18:15.380 --> 10:18:20.420
feel accomplished when you get night and then cooking i hope so i'm in the trenches right now

10:18:20.420 --> 10:18:21.460
on this swordfish

10:18:24.820 --> 10:18:28.020
she accidentally played the clip on stream she forgot to turn off this

10:18:34.900 --> 10:18:38.980
oh you can pass away if you drink too much water she actually uploaded it to me

10:18:39.460 --> 10:18:39.940
ah

10:18:42.420 --> 10:18:48.740
uh okay okay okay okay she already has a warning on her channel

10:18:50.180 --> 10:18:54.260
Amy playing with fire but then again she is the pyromaniac of uh

10:18:55.140 --> 10:19:00.660
veal or so right i'm right on par i can't believe i can't believe i found such a

10:19:00.660 --> 10:19:02.820
lower friendly girl's smile

10:19:06.420 --> 10:19:13.700
i have to admit i think i'm starting to lag a bit it's not looking good for me slowly

10:19:13.700 --> 10:19:21.140
perishing i'm like dad make a tea but i don't think it's gonna wake me up but i think it's gonna

10:19:21.700 --> 10:19:27.540
uh oh my stomach's making freaking weird ass noises can you hear that

10:19:33.140 --> 10:19:36.980
what will come first heat death of the universe or full inventory no burn

10:19:36.980 --> 10:19:41.860
honestly i feel like i'm getting so close to it and i'm getting although the burn percentage

10:19:41.860 --> 10:19:49.700
is 9.4 it used to be 18.9 she cut it out from the vod we're safe question mark i'm firmly of the

10:19:49.700 --> 10:19:59.460
opinion there's such a thing as being too big what's 99 after cooking no we're just doing cooking

10:19:59.460 --> 10:20:06.340
we might do some questing together because i'm not familiar with a lot of quests um but that would

10:20:06.340 --> 10:20:13.380
just be very casual um probably level up combat a little bit before that um once we've achieved

10:20:13.380 --> 10:20:24.100
99 cooking um i am not 99ing anything else i have severely underestimated how much this is

10:20:29.220 --> 10:20:35.540
a strong expect full to the kaboom if you ever do the cat quest you have to feed it when it's a

10:20:35.540 --> 10:20:41.380
kitten or it runs away that's so specific i'm probably never gonna retain this information

10:20:44.180 --> 10:20:48.660
i'm going to go for a full 99 account for the first time oh you're brave

10:20:50.260 --> 10:20:56.980
and the other version of runescape levels go up to 120 did they take even longer to achieve

10:21:00.500 --> 10:21:05.940
oh that's crazy sorry oh i'm having a wee on sorry

10:21:06.900 --> 10:21:22.500
oh my god i'm in the money lads i'm sorry i really don't want to flex on you guys but we're in the money

10:21:23.220 --> 10:21:24.740
oh

10:21:33.460 --> 10:21:39.940
look ah whoa fill inventory no burn get ready get ready to ever said no burn

10:21:42.980 --> 10:21:47.940
hold on hold on hold on so this is what it looked like a minute ago

10:21:48.260 --> 10:21:56.260
so that was the last time i shared it with you 19.8 okay and the money didn't register but now the

10:21:56.260 --> 10:22:05.460
money's registered are you ready to get flexed on where is it are you ready to get flexed on how

10:22:05.460 --> 10:22:13.300
much money i made on that video boom that's right get flexed on to say that gen 2 has been funded

10:22:13.300 --> 10:22:17.780
is an understatement that's how much money i've made what are you gonna do about them

10:22:21.620 --> 10:22:27.940
it got limited ads so it probably would have been like 20 bucks if it wasn't limited ads

10:22:27.940 --> 10:22:32.740
but you know what 10 bucks i'll take you you'll be logged out in 30 minutes make sure you move

10:22:32.740 --> 10:22:39.700
to a safe area or log out now your mama right i am going to go make a cup of tea then if it's

10:22:39.700 --> 10:22:46.740
going to log me out so i can come back in getting 120 is getting 99 about eight times

10:22:47.300 --> 10:22:52.100
pass on that no thanks how do people make a living off of youtube oh it's much better than

10:22:52.100 --> 10:23:00.340
this when you have like a a lot of ASMR videos to offer um you make like money generated in the

10:23:00.340 --> 10:23:05.620
background right i'm going to go make a cup of tea and let this game log me out um i will be back

10:23:05.620 --> 10:23:08.100
i would just take me about three minutes because you can't leave the world

10:23:11.940 --> 10:23:14.740
they're in the runescape's uh gadebrook strongy

10:23:16.500 --> 10:23:23.860

10:23:59.780 --> 10:24:09.940

10:26:29.780 --> 10:26:31.780
You

10:26:59.780 --> 10:27:01.780
You

10:27:29.780 --> 10:27:31.780
You

10:27:59.780 --> 10:28:01.780
You

10:28:29.780 --> 10:28:31.780
You

10:28:59.780 --> 10:29:01.780
You

10:29:30.780 --> 10:29:36.460
Oh, it's actually quite a lot louder than in-game audio. Sorry if that like completely destroyed your ears

10:29:36.660 --> 10:29:38.660
Hope no one's sleeping through this

10:29:39.260 --> 10:29:42.580
Her account has gone too. Wait, who's the count? Look at that

10:29:48.020 --> 10:29:50.020
What was I doing?

10:29:50.020 --> 10:29:52.020
fish fish fish

10:29:52.660 --> 10:29:57.740
I am starting to pass out. I'm not gonna lie. I'm getting very tired. I'm a throats way of sore

10:29:59.780 --> 10:30:02.100
Which is why I need refling tea

10:30:03.140 --> 10:30:05.140
Not just any kind of honey tea

10:30:06.180 --> 10:30:08.180
Log out timer is five minutes

10:30:08.340 --> 10:30:13.060
The music was pretty loud. Okay, man. I apologize. I've got honey on my freaking finger as well

10:30:14.660 --> 10:30:20.660
I'm not the good- I'm not my refling honey. I need a special refling honey. The menu music apparently a separate set. Yeah

10:30:22.580 --> 10:30:24.580
Monkey badness

10:30:24.580 --> 10:30:26.580
I

10:30:27.220 --> 10:30:34.740
Sleepy little refling because we're already snows together honestly. Oh, I'm I'm getting tired myself

10:30:44.740 --> 10:30:49.940
Oh gee Hermes, thank you for becoming a member as a remainder

10:30:51.140 --> 10:30:53.140
All membership streams

10:30:53.860 --> 10:30:54.820
No

10:30:54.820 --> 10:30:58.660
Next week membership streams start because I've already locked in what happens this week

10:30:59.460 --> 10:31:01.460
Next week is very busy

10:31:02.580 --> 10:31:04.580
is next week when

10:31:06.100 --> 10:31:06.980
Uh

10:31:06.980 --> 10:31:12.180
Elden Ring comes out. It's today next week Elden Ring DLC comes out. Okay, so

10:31:13.300 --> 10:31:15.300
The start of the week is gonna be like a

10:31:16.260 --> 10:31:20.900
multitude of different things going on. It's a little bit crazy sometimes

10:31:24.100 --> 10:31:28.260
Refling tea you mean ink tea? Exactly. That's what my refling tea is

10:31:29.700 --> 10:31:31.700
Passed it four times, but I got the tea

10:31:33.940 --> 10:31:35.220
I bet oh my god

10:31:35.220 --> 10:31:40.580
I love the stories where it's like my legs are quaking after a good session. I'm like, oh my god

10:31:41.460 --> 10:31:44.660
Oh, no, that's not it is I can't feel my legs after

10:31:45.380 --> 10:31:49.300
How hard I was beating in that session those ones always make me crack up

10:31:50.740 --> 10:31:52.740
What's good

10:31:53.860 --> 10:31:55.860
Uh

10:31:56.580 --> 10:32:02.660
Was good. Uh, we're going 10 and a half hours strong. We're wrapping up an hour

10:32:03.700 --> 10:32:11.140
In less than 30 because of the void restriction. Um, I am going to see if mercy is available

10:32:11.940 --> 10:32:13.940
to read into or a zero

10:32:14.820 --> 10:32:16.820
and

10:32:16.980 --> 10:32:21.700
Oh, my tummy keeps making noises. It's because I need uh, did I end up going for a job?

10:32:22.260 --> 10:32:27.620
No, it wasn't successful. I had an unsuccessful attempt at adjubi, which is why my stomach's making

10:32:28.420 --> 10:32:34.340
Uh, bizarre noises right now. Oh my god. I'm starting to get like full cooked sword run swordfish ones, which is amazing

10:32:34.980 --> 10:32:39.540
Do your reeflings want your money back? Am I undetected brieflings? Oh, no

10:32:39.780 --> 10:32:42.820
Is there any runescape reeflings that I'm indebted to?

10:32:43.620 --> 10:32:45.620
But I don't have any money

10:32:46.020 --> 10:32:51.460
How will I ever repay you runescape reefling for all the things you've done for me?

10:32:51.700 --> 10:32:53.700
I

10:32:55.220 --> 10:32:57.460
Get wrecked and connect for apparently

10:33:00.020 --> 10:33:02.980
Left for a bit and you're still going. Oh, I'm a tough cookie

10:33:03.860 --> 10:33:05.860
Hard hard to get me to crack

10:33:06.260 --> 10:33:10.100
When I say, uh, I need to make up for lost time. Am I I wasn't kidding?

10:33:11.060 --> 10:33:15.220
I wasn't kidding. Uh, literally next week. We've got like four. Maybe even five

10:33:16.020 --> 10:33:17.620
Oh

10:33:17.620 --> 10:33:22.980
Well, please don't be getting sick. I really don't want to get sick. Oh, I'm not gonna make it if I get sick

10:33:23.700 --> 10:33:26.180
I'm not gonna make it. I really don't want to get sick

10:33:30.980 --> 10:33:36.980
Bless you. Thank you. He's on high. I accept ASMR's payment. Oh, yeah

10:33:39.860 --> 10:33:41.860
Poor little

10:33:42.420 --> 10:33:44.420
Needing something

10:33:50.980 --> 10:33:54.020
One hour of agility treatment is payment because I can't be bothered

10:33:54.740 --> 10:33:56.340
bro

10:33:56.340 --> 10:34:02.580
I need to maybe get the agility shortcut wherever it is on the map. It's like 21 to do the grand exchange shortcut

10:34:03.380 --> 10:34:13.940
We formally request snitches. Mmm. Thank you for being my sugar daddy on RuneScape

10:34:16.100 --> 10:34:20.740
Thank you for making it super easy real emmy versus strony connect for

10:34:22.900 --> 10:34:24.900
The real

10:34:25.860 --> 10:34:32.100
Strony milkers warm and tasty strony milkies, please be hasty. Oh my god, that's such a good

10:34:33.620 --> 10:34:38.100
Uh, there's a connect for minigame in RuneScape. There absolutely is. Do you want to know how I know?

10:34:38.100 --> 10:34:44.340
There's a connect for minigame in RuneScape. Uh, I got absolutely annihilated by all the reeflings unanimously at once

10:34:45.060 --> 10:34:51.620
Uh, the only reason I think I won I won one game by tryharding and I won a second game by mistake

10:34:52.020 --> 10:34:54.280
Because the other reefling wasn't paying attention

10:34:56.580 --> 10:34:58.900
And I was literally eating a burrito and I was like

10:34:59.860 --> 10:35:01.860
With my mouth full of a burrito

10:35:05.620 --> 10:35:08.980
If you're going to do agility there's a quest so you can skip a lot of it

10:35:09.780 --> 10:35:11.780
I think when we do 99

10:35:12.420 --> 10:35:16.660
Cookin will probably take a solid break from any RuneScape streams for a bit

10:35:17.060 --> 10:35:22.340
Because there are a few other like multiplayer games I want to like focus on like Elden Rings like the next big

10:35:23.140 --> 10:35:25.140
Like a thing we're taking on

10:35:25.700 --> 10:35:27.700
and

10:35:28.260 --> 10:35:30.260
I don't even hear my stomach

10:35:32.260 --> 10:35:35.300
No, you can't the mic's not cover it is covering up

10:35:36.660 --> 10:35:42.100
The stronies milk tastes like jelly. I even know what cuttlefish milk would taste like

10:35:42.900 --> 10:35:47.300
Would it be gelatinous or would it be silky like ink?

10:35:49.380 --> 10:35:51.380
I think it may be silky

10:35:53.220 --> 10:35:55.220
Worthing

10:35:55.300 --> 10:35:57.140
Love these 20 things

10:35:57.140 --> 10:35:59.140
Thank you for the smoothies

10:35:59.220 --> 10:36:01.220
Also need to be on a members world for uh

10:36:03.460 --> 10:36:07.780
I'm blamed when it comes to board games. I lost fair and square though. Okay. Okay. Okay

10:36:08.660 --> 10:36:15.620
Well, actually who's got the higher IQ reeflings or stronies clearly the reeflings clearly

10:36:23.540 --> 10:36:28.740
Wow, we're at 1.4 on the swordfish we may be able to finish it

10:36:30.340 --> 10:36:33.860
We might just be out of time, but honestly, it's not the biggest deal. However

10:36:34.820 --> 10:36:38.260
You need to give strony the monkey not items. That's so specific

10:36:39.540 --> 10:36:41.540
and

10:36:41.700 --> 10:36:46.260
Eng would be salty if it's anything like squid ink. You've eaten squid ink before

10:36:48.420 --> 10:36:57.460
You've eaten your fellow reeflings before oh, we're in 1.6k territory at 1.6 million monkey not 287

10:36:58.260 --> 10:37:00.260
I blame all my eyes

10:37:00.820 --> 10:37:06.020
I'm on are you eating your fellow reeflings? What's going on here?

10:37:22.340 --> 10:37:23.620
See be honest

10:37:23.620 --> 10:37:26.740
You were just randomly placing the pieces, but I wasn't law

10:37:26.900 --> 10:37:31.380
I was trying to counteract what the reefling was doing. That's the worst part

10:37:31.540 --> 10:37:36.340
I was actually trying to win and I could never see what the reefling was making

10:37:36.660 --> 10:37:43.060
I was too busy trying to like get ahead and make something for me that I couldn't see what the reefling was doing

10:37:46.500 --> 10:37:54.420
Is worse than emmy rip of my jeans what I listen to emmy stream and if I recall correctly my glass prescription is worse than emmy

10:37:54.980 --> 10:37:59.700
Oh emmy cannot see oh my goodness bless her cotton socks. She can't see for

10:38:02.980 --> 10:38:05.700
A reefling's gotta do what he got a scuba doo ba doo

10:38:07.940 --> 10:38:13.460
Yeah, you literally saw what I was doing and then you forgot no because I was trying to like

10:38:14.100 --> 10:38:17.700
I was trying to be like all the reeflings doing this the reeflings doing that right

10:38:17.700 --> 10:38:20.660
So I'm not gonna place one here and then I'd immediately forget

10:38:21.620 --> 10:38:23.620
I

10:38:23.940 --> 10:38:25.940
Mods creases jays

10:38:27.380 --> 10:38:29.380
You really want me to believe that? Yeah

10:38:30.740 --> 10:38:32.740
I was like trying to think ahead

10:38:40.020 --> 10:38:42.420
I believe I can't believe I made it 10 us always

10:38:43.860 --> 10:38:45.860
Feels good, man

10:38:51.620 --> 10:38:53.620
Wow

10:38:54.020 --> 10:38:56.820
Okay, these swordfish are giving me like what

10:38:57.860 --> 10:39:00.900
7k a batch that's not bad

10:39:02.340 --> 10:39:06.180
Honestly not that bad. I know wine is more which is fine

10:39:06.900 --> 10:39:12.020
But I think that's like 7k exp of inventory if I don't burn them all. Okay. Okay

10:39:13.620 --> 10:39:15.620
Well spoke too soon on that one

10:39:16.580 --> 10:39:18.580
I

10:39:19.140 --> 10:39:26.820
Got some level up. It's time to beat on up on connect for strategy. It's like I'm beat strong the next time

10:39:34.420 --> 10:39:39.860
What's my burn percentage? Oh, it's like oh, I guess it's not up to accuracy because I'm logged out

10:39:40.980 --> 10:39:44.180
I got logged out against me will yeah, um

10:39:45.140 --> 10:39:51.700
Right tomorrow's crash bandicoot, which is eight hours. So it's just a long stream in quotation marks

10:39:52.820 --> 10:39:54.820
Not an endurance

10:39:55.060 --> 10:40:00.260
Short stream is two hours. Um, which is buckshot roulette, but that's because I've got the doctor

10:40:03.220 --> 10:40:07.460
And uh, I'll keep you guys up to date on what on earth is happening with me toe

10:40:07.460 --> 10:40:11.460
But it's pretty much decided if you guys want to hold a funeral during buckshot roulette

10:40:12.020 --> 10:40:14.980
You're more than welcome to pour one out for the toe

10:40:16.100 --> 10:40:18.100
It's been a good run, but

10:40:18.420 --> 10:40:21.380
I'm just no fussed for it. Does they make a difference to me?

10:40:22.420 --> 10:40:24.420
To me

10:40:24.980 --> 10:40:26.980
To me

10:40:28.740 --> 10:40:30.580
Riptoe

10:40:30.580 --> 10:40:33.060
It's a great lineup. Yeah, I did um, I

10:40:33.700 --> 10:40:37.140
Want or probably can't do it tonight because I'm going to be shattered

10:40:37.540 --> 10:40:42.660
I need to go put emmy and icys memberships live literally as soon as I end this stream

10:40:44.100 --> 10:40:46.100
So I need to

10:40:46.500 --> 10:40:48.500
What do I need to do?

10:40:50.260 --> 10:40:52.260
I need to

10:40:53.380 --> 10:40:55.380
Do that

10:40:55.860 --> 10:41:00.580
I wanted to look up baltro more because that actually looks like a genuinely fun game

10:41:01.140 --> 10:41:04.020
I just need to comprehend what on earth i'm doing first

10:41:04.500 --> 10:41:09.940
I don't know. Maybe I need to play it offline like off stream for a little bit just to get the hang of it

10:41:11.140 --> 10:41:14.340
Or is it better if streamer plays it for the first time?

10:41:15.300 --> 10:41:18.820
Like I don't think watching other people play it is cheating. I don't know

10:41:19.620 --> 10:41:23.860
Rips a big gripper. You will be missed literally both of them. No, no just the one

10:41:25.460 --> 10:41:30.020
Shawnee caught the da budus. Oh no, do you think I've got da budus?

10:41:30.340 --> 10:41:32.340
Um

10:41:32.420 --> 10:41:33.940
Oh my god

10:41:33.940 --> 10:41:38.500
streamer tries american sweet loses toenails loses toenail within

10:41:39.460 --> 10:41:41.220
one week

10:41:41.220 --> 10:41:43.220
Diabetes hits hard on streamer

10:41:47.060 --> 10:41:50.580
How many features do you see how many where we get no burns?

10:41:54.900 --> 10:41:59.540
How many multiplayer games are on your to-do list multiplayer games are every week

10:42:00.740 --> 10:42:05.380
Um next multiplayer game is elden ring for a while and then

10:42:07.140 --> 10:42:09.140
Probably jellybean

10:42:10.580 --> 10:42:13.860
I love my jellybean. I don't know if they've added more stuff to it

10:42:14.500 --> 10:42:18.820
Um, we never gave dead by daylight ago. I don't know how that would work

10:42:20.340 --> 10:42:26.260
I think I would have to add you guys as friends possibly on steam and then delete everyone at the end

10:42:26.580 --> 10:42:32.420
I don't know. I wanted to give fortnite a shot, but folk were rolling their eyes at fortnite

10:42:32.420 --> 10:42:34.900
But i'm like fortnite's actually know that bad

10:42:35.700 --> 10:42:39.860
As far as i'm aware, they've like added in different game modes and stuff

10:42:40.980 --> 10:42:42.980
um

10:42:45.140 --> 10:42:49.540
I want uh, I would say mario kart but I suck at mario kart and it and

10:42:50.740 --> 10:42:54.100
Like I don't I don't know how to do that new turn feature thing in it

10:42:54.180 --> 10:42:56.340
Like we have to like turn left and right well

10:42:58.420 --> 10:43:00.920
Call it momay win the jellybean game

10:43:04.100 --> 10:43:06.900
It's a meme to hate fortnite at this point

10:43:18.020 --> 10:43:19.700
It's just

10:43:19.700 --> 10:43:22.340
Ever listened to rap city you want to sing it?

10:43:23.300 --> 10:43:29.620
Is this the real life or is this just fantasy?

10:43:31.460 --> 10:43:38.500
Caught in a landslide no escape from reality

10:43:41.380 --> 10:43:45.220
Look in your eyes. I don't know the words and see

10:43:48.020 --> 10:43:50.020
uh

10:43:53.220 --> 10:43:55.140
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no

10:43:57.620 --> 10:44:02.180
So you think you can stop me and make me cry

10:44:04.500 --> 10:44:08.420
So you think I'm just gonna lay down and die

10:44:10.740 --> 10:44:12.740
Oh baby

10:44:14.100 --> 10:44:19.700
Just can't wait to go just can't wait to go here. Is that the word?

10:44:19.700 --> 10:44:23.700
I don't know. I don't know.

10:44:23.700 --> 10:44:25.700
Um...

10:44:25.700 --> 10:44:28.700
I was thinking about the in-game song. Oops.

10:44:28.700 --> 10:44:30.700
My bad.

10:44:30.700 --> 10:44:33.700
Where does- where does that go?

10:44:33.700 --> 10:44:38.700
Easy come, easy go, little high, little low

10:44:38.700 --> 10:44:44.700
Anyway the wind blows, it doesn't matter to me

10:44:44.700 --> 10:44:49.700
I'm just a poor boy from a poor family, he's just a poor boy

10:44:49.700 --> 10:44:53.700
Spare him his life from this monstrosity

10:44:53.700 --> 10:44:56.700
Uh, how else does it go?

10:44:56.700 --> 10:45:01.700
Galaleo, Galaleo, Galaleo, Galaleo, Galaleo

10:45:01.700 --> 10:45:04.700
Oh no, no, no, let him go

10:45:04.700 --> 10:45:06.700
Don't let him go

10:45:06.700 --> 10:45:10.700
I can't remember how that freaking goes

10:45:11.700 --> 10:45:15.700
What to unlock it so you can listen to it?

10:45:15.700 --> 10:45:19.700
Though I finished these freaking swordfish before I fall asleep

10:45:19.700 --> 10:45:23.700
I'm like so tired, my eyes are bulging out of their skull right now

10:45:23.700 --> 10:45:26.700
I'm ready to snooze

10:45:26.700 --> 10:45:29.700
Although I might level up actually, before I snooze

10:45:29.700 --> 10:45:32.700
Best cover, let me go, we will not let you go

10:45:32.700 --> 10:45:34.700
No, no, no, no, no

10:45:34.700 --> 10:45:37.700
No, it's important, it's good

10:45:38.700 --> 10:45:42.700
Best cover, oh yeah, did you enjoy that, me guessing all the lyrics of that entire thing

10:45:42.700 --> 10:45:45.700
Cause I completely forgot how it works

10:45:45.700 --> 10:45:47.700
That's like full level now

10:45:47.700 --> 10:45:52.700
Wow, we're gonna be 78 by the end of this, feels good man

10:45:52.700 --> 10:45:55.700
Feel good man

10:45:59.700 --> 10:46:02.700
Oh excuse me for yelling

10:46:02.700 --> 10:46:05.700
I'm so going to bed, oh my god

10:46:08.700 --> 10:46:12.700
I'm just a perv, we fun, I need no sympathy

10:46:16.700 --> 10:46:20.700
I'm just a perv, we fun, I need no sympathy

10:46:23.700 --> 10:46:25.700
Wait what?

10:46:25.700 --> 10:46:28.700
I wonder, I'm just a perv

10:46:28.700 --> 10:46:33.700
Cause I have a mummy, mummy's losing the plot, that's what mummy's doing right now

10:46:33.700 --> 10:46:39.700
I'm starting to get about H2O delirious up in here

10:46:39.700 --> 10:46:45.700
There's a bird outside my window, the magpies are probably wondering why I haven't said them today

10:46:49.700 --> 10:46:52.700
I can do it, I promise

10:46:52.700 --> 10:46:55.700
I can do it, I can stay up, I'm totally not exhausted

10:46:55.700 --> 10:46:57.700
But it's okay

10:46:58.700 --> 10:47:01.700
I can make it happen

10:47:01.700 --> 10:47:03.700
I can make it happen

10:47:09.700 --> 10:47:11.700
Yay!

10:47:11.700 --> 10:47:14.700
I didn't get any seratonin but I think it's cause I'm so tired

10:47:14.700 --> 10:47:16.700
There's no seratonin left in my system

10:47:16.700 --> 10:47:19.700
You don't have anything to burn on the fire, I do so

10:47:19.700 --> 10:47:23.700
Level 78, let's go

10:47:23.700 --> 10:47:26.700
Level 78

10:47:26.700 --> 10:47:29.700
Well now I gotta adapt the learn

10:47:29.700 --> 10:47:32.700
Yeah eventually seratonin only comes from netting it

10:47:32.700 --> 10:47:35.700
Man this game was rigged from the start

10:47:35.700 --> 10:47:38.700
Reach for the start

10:47:39.700 --> 10:47:40.700
Yippee!

10:47:40.700 --> 10:47:45.700
78, well I definitely blew over my guesstimate for what we would be on

10:47:45.700 --> 10:47:50.700
But I'm still back at level 62

10:47:50.700 --> 10:47:52.700
That's fine

10:47:52.700 --> 10:47:57.700
Maybe Wayne cost a lot of money though, that's the only problem

10:48:02.700 --> 10:48:05.700
Are we friends? I can do it

10:48:05.700 --> 10:48:08.700
I can do it, you kid

10:48:08.700 --> 10:48:13.700
I could also cook and not waste exp, she's passing out, oh yeah

10:48:13.700 --> 10:48:18.700
Oh my god I'm actually, like this sleep is really starting to hit me

10:48:18.700 --> 10:48:20.700
I don't even have my tea yet

10:48:20.700 --> 10:48:23.700
Can you hear it, can you tell them?

10:48:23.700 --> 10:48:26.700
Wah, KFP with another 10

10:48:26.700 --> 10:48:29.700
Thank you, my goodness

10:48:29.700 --> 10:48:32.700
Are you squidding me right now?

10:48:32.700 --> 10:48:35.700
Are you squidding me right now?

10:48:35.700 --> 10:48:39.700
Congrats to those who caught the membership with their faceballs

10:48:39.700 --> 10:48:44.700
Oh I wasn't even cooking them swordfish, I'm getting so disheartened

10:48:44.700 --> 10:48:47.700
I have my copper tea in my hand right now

10:48:47.700 --> 10:48:50.700
I should probably go to sleep, I'm freaking ready to go

10:48:50.700 --> 10:48:53.700
Are you squidding me right now?

10:48:54.700 --> 10:48:57.700
Are you squidding me right now?

10:48:58.700 --> 10:49:02.700
Are you squidding me right now?

10:49:02.700 --> 10:49:05.700
Are you squidding me right now?

10:49:18.700 --> 10:49:22.700
But she doesn't know if you're playing for another hour or not

10:49:24.700 --> 10:49:30.700
If there's any wee snippets that want to be a deer and pass on a message from Mummy

10:49:33.700 --> 10:49:36.700
A big bug

10:49:36.700 --> 10:49:40.700
Zero grapes in Vorkuta

10:49:40.700 --> 10:49:44.700
Oh wait, sorry that's the boat from Black Wolf

10:49:44.700 --> 10:49:46.700
Didn't make it sad

10:49:46.700 --> 10:49:49.700
What's your take on levelling up without OO, only to your level?

10:49:49.700 --> 10:49:52.700
Oh no, you can level up all you want, it's perfectly fine too

10:49:52.700 --> 10:49:56.700
For me personally, I'm not going to level up offline

10:49:56.700 --> 10:50:00.700
Thank you again KFP Spidey for the gifted mumber

10:50:00.700 --> 10:50:04.700
Okay, that was a big stagger

10:50:04.700 --> 10:50:07.700
Star, I'm very tired

10:50:07.700 --> 10:50:10.700
I will drink my tea now

10:50:17.700 --> 10:50:23.700
The gifted membership was what I was supposed to say in English

10:50:23.700 --> 10:50:26.700
The royal monkey

10:50:26.700 --> 10:50:29.700
Cooking on top of the strony

10:50:34.700 --> 10:50:37.700
Mercy said that she will lately still be live in an hour

10:50:37.700 --> 10:50:41.700
Okay, thank you snippets for checking that out

10:50:42.700 --> 10:50:44.700
I can do it

10:50:44.700 --> 10:50:47.700
I can do it, 50 minutes

10:50:47.700 --> 10:50:51.700
Oh Mummy can do it, Mummy's just very tired

10:50:51.700 --> 10:50:53.700
Do your reflexes

10:50:53.700 --> 10:50:57.700
I'm ready to pass out, oh my god my bed time's normally 5 o'clock

10:50:57.700 --> 10:51:02.700
I've got 2 more hours until bedtime and I'm perishing

10:51:02.700 --> 10:51:06.700
I don't want to end early though, the whole point is supposed to be the same

10:51:07.700 --> 10:51:12.700
I don't want to end early though, the whole point is supposed to be endurance

10:51:12.700 --> 10:51:16.700
Oh my god, this is like whacking me for the sake of my head

10:51:19.700 --> 10:51:23.700
Normally I don't do

10:51:23.700 --> 10:51:28.700
Oh my god, please cooperate

10:51:28.700 --> 10:51:32.700
My brain's not cooperating, oh crap

10:51:33.700 --> 10:51:38.700
Sleepy beepy mummy

10:51:41.700 --> 10:51:47.700
Almost there, almost there, we just have to hold on and replay

10:51:47.700 --> 10:51:52.700
Please hold on with me, hold, we can do it

10:51:52.700 --> 10:51:58.700
We just have to cook these billions swordfish that we were kindly gifted replay

10:52:02.700 --> 10:52:08.700
Strani, what's your feelings about a you start sleepy time when your girlfriend just happens to

10:52:08.700 --> 10:52:13.700
See, on me, no, me doing that to you, absolutely

10:52:15.700 --> 10:52:19.700
I will discuss more of that in the member stream, maybe

10:52:19.700 --> 10:52:25.700
Hold the lane, hold the lane, I'm holding

10:52:25.700 --> 10:52:27.700
Okay, so far so good

10:52:27.700 --> 10:52:32.700
Old school runescape is heavy due to insurance game, only game to challenge Strani this much

10:52:32.700 --> 10:52:35.700
Literally I'm like so tired out of nowhere

10:52:35.700 --> 10:52:40.700
I was supposed to eat that food and I was supposed to freaking help me

10:52:40.700 --> 10:52:45.700
Get more energised and I just want to roll up into a ball and pass out

10:52:45.700 --> 10:52:51.700
I'm like sipping honey tea, it's got caffeine in it, it's going to do absolutely nothing for me

10:52:52.700 --> 10:52:57.700
A sugar crash, did I eat? Would that take away half sugar in it?

10:53:00.700 --> 10:53:02.700
You can sleep early

10:53:04.700 --> 10:53:06.700
Someone got a clues girl

10:53:09.700 --> 10:53:15.700
Oh, on me, on you, a true Strani classic

10:53:15.700 --> 10:53:20.700
Honestly, I feel really bad, but like I want to do like all these things to you, Rieflin

10:53:20.700 --> 10:53:24.700
But you doing it to me, I'm like, I'm too scared

10:53:24.700 --> 10:53:28.700
Or like I'm not, that's not really doing much for me

10:53:28.700 --> 10:53:31.700
But me doing it to you, eh

10:53:34.700 --> 10:53:38.700
Like the terrible ones that you're not supposed to speak out loud

10:53:38.700 --> 10:53:43.700
I've written on some kind of sugar

10:53:43.700 --> 10:53:48.700
Oh, sugar, sugar, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum

10:53:48.700 --> 10:53:52.700
Oh, honey, honey, mm, mm, mm, mm, mm

10:53:52.700 --> 10:53:57.700
You ask my candy Rieflin

10:53:57.700 --> 10:54:02.700
And you've got me, mm, mm, mm

10:54:02.700 --> 10:54:05.700
Our bodies are ready, please

10:54:05.700 --> 10:54:08.700
Always happy to be your guinea pig

10:54:08.700 --> 10:54:11.700
No, it's good, I love that

10:54:11.700 --> 10:54:16.700
No, I'll be fine, I promise, I'm fine, I'm fine, I can do it

10:54:16.700 --> 10:54:21.700
Endurance, endurance, endurance, I will make sure I'm redirecting Mercy in this next batch

10:54:21.700 --> 10:54:24.700
Because it's not going to work out

10:54:26.700 --> 10:54:32.700
I'm feeling kind of tired, but I'm going to stick it out through until you get off

10:54:32.700 --> 10:54:35.700
I'm getting off right now, I'm ovulating

10:54:35.700 --> 10:54:40.700
Oh, no, my filter is going, I'm sorry, I shouldn't be saying that stuff

10:54:40.700 --> 10:54:44.700
I'm sorry, I shouldn't be saying that stuff

10:54:44.700 --> 10:54:47.700
Hold on, let me wake the frick up, let me wake up

10:54:47.700 --> 10:54:53.700
Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up

10:54:53.700 --> 10:54:55.700
Grab a little makeup

10:54:55.700 --> 10:55:00.700
Put the keys upon the table, something, something else, it's like a fable

10:55:00.700 --> 10:55:02.700
Let's get Mercy's

10:55:03.700 --> 10:55:06.700
Livestream, Old Skilled Rinskate

10:55:06.700 --> 10:55:09.700
Customization, Direct

10:55:09.700 --> 10:55:14.700
And it should have picked Mercy

10:55:14.700 --> 10:55:18.700
Should have picked any kind of support

10:55:18.700 --> 10:55:23.700
I'm sorry for saying that out loud

10:55:23.700 --> 10:55:25.700
Mommy's getting tired

10:55:26.700 --> 10:55:30.700
System of a Down Reference, yeah, chops away

10:55:38.700 --> 10:55:41.700
She makes a lot of random base references

10:55:41.700 --> 10:55:43.700
Should have gotten a Scotland Fender with

10:55:45.700 --> 10:55:49.700
In your 20s, are you an OG-san?

10:55:50.700 --> 10:55:55.700
There you make sure you're an OG-san, surely

10:55:55.700 --> 10:55:57.700
Surely

10:56:01.700 --> 10:56:04.700
You should stream more when you're both tired, and I'll be like

10:56:04.700 --> 10:56:07.700
Sorry, I don't know if you know

10:56:07.700 --> 10:56:09.700
I don't remember that till day they do it

10:56:09.700 --> 10:56:11.700
Who does it?

10:56:12.700 --> 10:56:14.700
The day who does what?

10:56:15.700 --> 10:56:17.700
What does that mean?

10:56:17.700 --> 10:56:19.700
What does that mean?

10:56:20.700 --> 10:56:22.700
But the game ends up going offline

10:56:22.700 --> 10:56:25.700
Oh, like the game updates for patches

10:56:25.700 --> 10:56:27.700
Yeah, there he tags that, there he won

10:56:27.700 --> 10:56:30.700
So on death's door, no!

10:56:30.700 --> 10:56:33.700
Witchy-sans are supposed to be fairies

10:56:34.700 --> 10:56:38.700
I don't know, we ended up being...

10:56:38.700 --> 10:56:43.700
It's all in four, your tears are what I live for

10:56:44.700 --> 10:56:49.700
Cause you should have picked Mercy

10:56:50.700 --> 10:56:55.700
Should have picked any kind of girl of your...

10:56:56.700 --> 10:56:58.700
Yeah, my tummy!

10:56:58.700 --> 10:57:00.700
I don't know if you can hear those internal farts

10:57:00.700 --> 10:57:02.700
But if you can hear the internal farts

10:57:02.700 --> 10:57:04.700
I'm sorry, I had to be this way

10:57:07.700 --> 10:57:09.700
Didn't I see this stream this morning?

10:57:09.700 --> 10:57:11.700
Kinda was, yeah, yeah, you did

10:57:11.700 --> 10:57:12.700
I'm a wee bit addicted

10:57:12.700 --> 10:57:14.700
I'm starting to lose the plot though

10:57:14.700 --> 10:57:18.700
So you're welcome to watch my Descent Into Madness

10:57:18.700 --> 10:57:20.700
My filter is also gone

10:57:20.700 --> 10:57:24.700
Because I'm starting to see things I know I'm not supposed to see

10:57:24.700 --> 10:57:27.700
They're kinda just coming out, just like your ink, you know?

10:57:29.700 --> 10:57:30.700
Only so much I can do

10:57:30.700 --> 10:57:33.700
We're actually gonna get less than a thousand sorbys

10:57:35.700 --> 10:57:37.700
Internal farts? No, they are internal farts

10:57:37.700 --> 10:57:39.700
Well at least something's digested

10:57:40.700 --> 10:57:43.700
But this must mean I'm discussing

10:57:45.700 --> 10:57:47.700
To make myself wealthy

10:57:47.700 --> 10:57:50.700
She's slowly dying from my innocence

10:57:55.700 --> 10:57:58.700
I came in at work quite tired and feisty

10:57:58.700 --> 10:58:01.700
Wrote an entire world domination agenda on my calendar

10:58:01.700 --> 10:58:05.700
Are we done it? Are we taking down the big companies?

10:58:06.700 --> 10:58:10.700
Eleven hour grind set, interest of thoughts are in taking the wheel

10:58:11.700 --> 10:58:13.700
Take the wheel

10:58:15.700 --> 10:58:17.700
Man, really?

10:58:17.700 --> 10:58:19.700
Oh, I completely started to do that

10:58:19.700 --> 10:58:21.700
Man, RuneScape is really...

10:58:21.700 --> 10:58:22.700
OG

10:58:22.700 --> 10:58:24.700
Yes, old school RuneScape

10:58:24.700 --> 10:58:27.700
RuneScape 3, which is the new one, I think

10:58:27.700 --> 10:58:30.700
Not really played that at all

10:58:30.700 --> 10:58:32.700
I didn't actually understand

10:58:33.700 --> 10:58:35.700
When it came out, there was two different games

10:58:35.700 --> 10:58:38.700
And I think I actually ended up playing RuneScape 3

10:58:38.700 --> 10:58:40.700
For a little bit like a dummy

10:58:40.700 --> 10:58:42.700
Because I was like, why is the game so different?

10:58:42.700 --> 10:58:44.700
Why did they do that?

10:58:45.700 --> 10:58:47.700
Or was it they made RuneScape 3

10:58:47.700 --> 10:58:49.700
And then everyone was like, ooh, go back

10:58:49.700 --> 10:58:52.700
And then they were like, okay, there's now two games

10:58:54.700 --> 10:58:56.700
These are the golden hours

10:58:56.700 --> 10:58:57.700
So this is the last bit

10:58:57.700 --> 10:59:00.700
Uh, not quite, we've still got...

10:59:03.700 --> 10:59:05.700
50 minutes, I could have sworn it said 50 minutes

10:59:05.700 --> 10:59:07.700
50 minutes ago, but...

10:59:07.700 --> 10:59:08.700
There's three?

10:59:08.700 --> 10:59:10.700
I thought there was like RuneScape 3

10:59:10.700 --> 10:59:13.700
Wasn't the new RuneScape called RuneScape 3?

10:59:13.700 --> 10:59:15.700
It's really OG-san

10:59:17.700 --> 10:59:19.700
Get it? Cause that's how I say OG

10:59:20.700 --> 10:59:23.700
RuneScape 3 is the original server from that

10:59:23.700 --> 10:59:25.700
Old-school RuneScape is them

10:59:25.700 --> 10:59:27.700
We put in the old game back

10:59:27.700 --> 10:59:29.700
Oh, okay

10:59:29.700 --> 10:59:32.700
Cause they did a World of Warcraft do that as well

10:59:32.700 --> 10:59:35.700
There's like an old world warcraft

10:59:35.700 --> 10:59:36.700
Oh my god

10:59:36.700 --> 10:59:41.700
My tongue is not even following what I'm telling it to do

10:59:41.700 --> 10:59:42.700
Wah!

10:59:46.700 --> 10:59:48.700
You said three batches before, this is a lot...

10:59:48.700 --> 10:59:50.700
No, come on

10:59:53.700 --> 10:59:56.700
Oh, almost just knocked over my cola everywhere

10:59:57.700 --> 10:59:59.700
I really should clean this up

10:59:59.700 --> 11:00:01.700
But what happens if I feel not...

11:00:01.700 --> 11:00:03.700
Stop opening up the collection

11:00:03.700 --> 11:00:05.700
And stop eating the swordfish

11:00:05.700 --> 11:00:07.700
We're gonna sell that, we need that money

11:00:07.700 --> 11:00:09.700
Okay, we're at 900 now

11:00:10.700 --> 11:00:11.700
Wah

11:00:14.700 --> 11:00:15.700
Wah

11:00:15.700 --> 11:00:17.700
How big is an inventory?

11:00:17.700 --> 11:00:22.700
4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28

11:00:22.700 --> 11:00:23.700
Okay

11:00:23.700 --> 11:00:26.700
By the 28, that's like...

11:00:26.700 --> 11:00:29.700
4 for every 100

11:00:34.700 --> 11:00:36.700
Refling on time

11:00:42.700 --> 11:00:44.700
Play both just...

11:00:44.700 --> 11:00:46.700
Wait, what did you say?

11:00:46.700 --> 11:00:47.700
Just play both

11:00:47.700 --> 11:00:50.700
It's not like this game is grindy or anything

11:00:50.700 --> 11:00:52.700
Are you gonna disappoint us or not?

11:00:52.700 --> 11:00:55.700
No, I'm not gonna disappoint and I'm freaking doing it

11:00:55.700 --> 11:00:57.700
I'm freaking...

11:00:57.700 --> 11:00:59.700
I'm cooking the swordfish

11:00:59.700 --> 11:01:04.700
I'm cooking my ancestors and my cousins and stuff

11:01:04.700 --> 11:01:06.700
Cause get it? Cause I'm a cultfish?

11:01:10.700 --> 11:01:12.700
Are you refling?

11:01:12.700 --> 11:01:15.700
You're requesting us to go open it

11:01:15.700 --> 11:01:16.700
Wah!

11:01:18.700 --> 11:01:20.700
Are you refling?

11:01:21.700 --> 11:01:24.700
Are you even losing that ability to read right now?

11:01:24.700 --> 11:01:26.700
I don't think you said that

11:01:26.700 --> 11:01:28.700
Holy crap

11:01:28.700 --> 11:01:31.700
As you're refling, you're requesting me to go open it

11:01:31.700 --> 11:01:33.700
Okay, that looks more like English

11:01:33.700 --> 11:01:36.700
Go to sleep... No, you go to sleep

11:01:36.700 --> 11:01:38.700
Go to sleep when...

11:01:40.700 --> 11:01:42.700
When something happens

11:01:42.700 --> 11:01:44.700
Go

11:01:48.700 --> 11:01:50.700
I'm gonna... I can do endurance stream

11:01:50.700 --> 11:01:52.700
Literally, I don't want to lose my endurance title

11:01:52.700 --> 11:01:55.700
Like 2 cent meters of playing the game

11:01:55.700 --> 11:01:57.700
Wah

11:01:58.700 --> 11:02:01.700
I'll only go to sleep if you come with me

11:02:01.700 --> 11:02:03.700
Come with me

11:02:03.700 --> 11:02:06.700
Oh no, it's the wrong one, it's that Japanese song

11:02:06.700 --> 11:02:08.700
Stay with me

11:02:13.700 --> 11:02:16.700
Ta-da-da-da-da

11:02:16.700 --> 11:02:18.700
I don't know how the rest of it goes

11:02:21.700 --> 11:02:24.700
I'll only sleep if you decide to sleep as well

11:02:24.700 --> 11:02:26.700
Yeah

11:02:26.700 --> 11:02:28.700
Self-hypnotism by exhaustion

11:02:28.700 --> 11:02:30.700
This is working apparently

11:02:30.700 --> 11:02:32.700
No

11:02:32.700 --> 11:02:35.700
You've been streaming for 11 hours

11:02:35.700 --> 11:02:38.700
Nobody's taking your endurance stream title from you

11:02:39.700 --> 11:02:44.700
I'm just gonna eat this little cheeky

11:02:44.700 --> 11:02:47.700
Cheeky swordfish on a Sunday afternoon

11:02:47.700 --> 11:02:49.700
I don't even know what day of the week is

11:02:49.700 --> 11:02:51.700
You know what day of the week is?

11:02:51.700 --> 11:02:53.700
Stream day

11:02:53.700 --> 11:02:56.700
I like it, it'll be more and more weekly

11:03:00.700 --> 11:03:02.700
Imagine if I could swim

11:03:02.700 --> 11:03:04.700
Oh

11:03:06.700 --> 11:03:08.700
Then for that time I got hired to sing

11:03:10.700 --> 11:03:13.700
Right, stop it, that's naughty

11:03:14.700 --> 11:03:16.700
That's naughty

11:03:16.700 --> 11:03:18.700
Okay, we're almost finished with the swordfish

11:03:21.700 --> 11:03:27.700
You're beginning to feel very, very sleepy

11:03:27.700 --> 11:03:31.700
Why are you talking like a vampire

11:03:33.700 --> 11:03:35.700
Hmm

11:03:36.700 --> 11:03:38.700
Stay with me

11:03:47.700 --> 11:03:49.700
What are they even talking about, honestly?

11:03:49.700 --> 11:03:52.700
I feel like I'm eavesdropping to see what they're talking about

11:03:52.700 --> 11:03:54.700
I'll wait for their new message to pop up

11:03:54.700 --> 11:03:58.700
And I'll start commenting on what the rooflings are talking about to each other

11:03:58.700 --> 11:04:01.700
They'll never expect it

11:04:01.700 --> 11:04:04.700
Oh, for goodness sake, I don't know how to keep them up

11:04:07.700 --> 11:04:09.700
Boom, boom, look at that name

11:04:09.700 --> 11:04:11.700
They're teak, no

11:04:11.700 --> 11:04:13.700
Please leave it alone

11:04:14.700 --> 11:04:16.700
She collected again

11:04:16.700 --> 11:04:18.700
Oh, I'm not late to collect

11:04:19.700 --> 11:04:21.700
It's because I'm a waman

11:04:21.700 --> 11:04:23.700
My mistakes is I'm even in runescape

11:04:23.700 --> 11:04:25.700
I'm sorry, that's not nice

11:04:25.700 --> 11:04:28.700
You can just play the waman card whenever you want

11:04:28.700 --> 11:04:30.700
That's kind of funny though

11:04:32.700 --> 11:04:40.700
I don't know why you're right-clicking at

11:04:40.700 --> 11:04:42.700
I don't know, maybe I'll right-click you

11:04:42.700 --> 11:04:44.700
What are you gonna do about that?

11:04:44.700 --> 11:04:46.700
Right-click is funny enough

11:04:49.700 --> 11:04:51.700
Collect your ink

11:04:52.700 --> 11:04:55.700
Look into the mirror, you're not giving

11:04:55.700 --> 11:04:58.700
We're talking about time-spanning games

11:04:58.700 --> 11:05:01.700
Is your rune-crafting world still up?

11:05:01.700 --> 11:05:03.700
I remember the old rune-crafting

11:05:03.700 --> 11:05:05.700
I don't know what that means

11:05:05.700 --> 11:05:07.700
But thank you for your question

11:05:07.700 --> 11:05:09.700
The answer is probably no, smile

11:05:09.700 --> 11:05:12.700
I don't know anything about runescape

11:05:12.700 --> 11:05:14.700
Good night, scrawny and everyone

11:05:14.700 --> 11:05:16.700
I'm going to sleep

11:05:16.700 --> 11:05:18.700
Rest well

11:05:18.700 --> 11:05:20.700
Go

11:05:20.700 --> 11:05:22.700
Twinkle, twinkle

11:05:22.700 --> 11:05:24.700
Look for

11:05:24.700 --> 11:05:26.700
How I wonder

11:05:26.700 --> 11:05:28.700
What you are

11:05:28.700 --> 11:05:32.700
Up above the world so high

11:05:32.700 --> 11:05:36.700
Like a diamond in the sky

11:05:36.700 --> 11:05:38.700
Twinkle, twinkle

11:05:38.700 --> 11:05:41.700
I swear if anyone puts anything under 18

11:05:41.700 --> 11:05:43.700
To that question, you're all done

11:05:50.700 --> 11:05:53.700
Okay, we've got 45 minutes or something like that

11:05:53.700 --> 11:05:55.700
Oh no, now we've got 50

11:05:55.700 --> 11:05:57.700
No, we've got less than 50 minutes

11:05:57.700 --> 11:05:59.700
We've got 49 minutes

11:05:59.700 --> 11:06:01.700
Because the board breaks all of them

11:06:12.700 --> 11:06:16.700
Should I write the girl's marrows as a prank?

11:06:16.700 --> 11:06:18.700
We could do that

11:06:19.700 --> 11:06:23.700
You pretend to not be me and write the girl's marrows

11:06:23.700 --> 11:06:26.700
And say the most terrible stuff in there

11:06:34.700 --> 11:06:36.700
Do it, do an extremely spicy one

11:06:36.700 --> 11:06:39.700
Okay, who should we do for us?

11:06:39.700 --> 11:06:41.700
Mods, can I give you permission to speak

11:06:41.700 --> 11:06:43.700
So you give me the girl's links and I'll write some stuff

11:06:43.700 --> 11:06:45.700
And then I'll wash my hands as I should

11:06:54.700 --> 11:06:56.700
And

11:06:58.700 --> 11:07:01.700
So I only mentioned things that only you would know

11:07:01.700 --> 11:07:03.700
The girls aren't gonna know who we're doing

11:07:03.700 --> 11:07:05.700
Azura, oh my god, okay

11:07:05.700 --> 11:07:07.700
Let's go to Azura

11:07:11.700 --> 11:07:15.700
Big, juicy, choco knockers

11:07:17.700 --> 11:07:19.700
You are so beautiful

11:07:19.700 --> 11:07:22.700
Your voice is so beautiful

11:07:22.700 --> 11:07:25.700
Your personality so beautiful

11:07:25.700 --> 11:07:28.700
Beautiful

11:07:28.700 --> 11:07:34.700
You are a blessing upon my life and yet

11:07:34.700 --> 11:07:39.700
You are the goddess who gives blessings

11:07:39.700 --> 11:07:42.700
But I am already blessed

11:07:42.700 --> 11:07:48.700
You didn't have to give me, you didn't have to give me the blessing

11:07:48.700 --> 11:07:50.700
God, I love you

11:07:50.700 --> 11:07:52.700
Chocolate milkers

11:07:52.700 --> 11:07:54.700
Good night, Azura

11:07:54.700 --> 11:07:56.700
You are loved

11:07:56.700 --> 11:07:58.700
Okay, that's Azura done

11:08:00.700 --> 11:08:02.700
I'd like to keep my message private

11:08:02.700 --> 11:08:04.700
Yes, sent

11:08:06.700 --> 11:08:08.700
Yes, okay, sent

11:08:08.700 --> 11:08:10.700
We have done Azura

11:08:12.700 --> 11:08:14.700
You'll never know it's me

11:08:15.700 --> 11:08:19.700
More swordfish, I demand more swordfish

11:08:19.700 --> 11:08:21.700
Give me swordfish

11:08:21.700 --> 11:08:23.700
Okay, done Azura

11:08:23.700 --> 11:08:25.700
Who next?

11:08:25.700 --> 11:08:27.700
AC

11:08:29.700 --> 11:08:32.700
Go to, no, open up AC

11:08:32.700 --> 11:08:34.700
Go to say

11:08:35.700 --> 11:08:37.700
Okay, I'm stressed

11:08:37.700 --> 11:08:40.700
Wait, oh, where did you go?

11:08:41.700 --> 11:08:44.700
You're so tiny and cute

11:08:45.700 --> 11:08:48.700
Oh my god, I'm going to be an OG-san

11:08:48.700 --> 11:08:52.700
I'm a self-identified OG-san

11:08:52.700 --> 11:08:56.700
And my god, you're so tiny

11:08:56.700 --> 11:09:00.700
I want to care for you forever

11:09:00.700 --> 11:09:06.700
I want to do what I can to make you happy, little cub

11:09:07.700 --> 11:09:11.700
I love that you call yourself cub

11:09:11.700 --> 11:09:14.700
It's too adorable

11:09:14.700 --> 11:09:19.700
My old man, OG-san, heart can't take it

11:09:19.700 --> 11:09:23.700
As long as you're happy

11:09:23.700 --> 11:09:26.700
I am happy, little cub

11:09:27.700 --> 11:09:36.700
Let me make you happy with my OG-san

11:09:36.700 --> 11:09:38.700
Oh, no, you can't say that

11:09:38.700 --> 11:09:43.700
Let me make you happy with OG-san's body

11:09:43.700 --> 11:09:45.700
OG-san's body

11:09:45.700 --> 11:09:47.700
Okay, there we go, send

11:09:50.700 --> 11:09:52.700
Okay, more swordfish

11:09:53.700 --> 11:09:56.700
Who's next?

11:10:00.700 --> 11:10:03.700
I'd like to burn the swordfish, please

11:10:03.700 --> 11:10:04.700
Who's next?

11:10:04.700 --> 11:10:07.700
Emi, oh, where'd I even begin?

11:10:10.700 --> 11:10:13.700
I wish for you to perish me

11:10:14.700 --> 11:10:19.700
Then laugh in my face as you raise me

11:10:19.700 --> 11:10:23.700
Back and forth with your, with your what?

11:10:23.700 --> 11:10:27.700
With your, your powers, your powers?

11:10:27.700 --> 11:10:30.700
With your powers

11:10:30.700 --> 11:10:34.700
I want to be humiliated

11:10:34.700 --> 11:10:35.700
Oh god, she's going to notice me

11:10:35.700 --> 11:10:37.700
Because I can't spell humiliated

11:10:37.700 --> 11:10:41.700
I want to be humiliated by you over and over

11:10:41.700 --> 11:10:44.700
I want to see that

11:10:45.700 --> 11:10:50.700
Shit, shit, eaten, grin

11:10:50.700 --> 11:10:57.700
As I disappoint you and take any punishment you deserve

11:10:57.700 --> 11:11:00.700
I love you, holsys

11:11:05.700 --> 11:11:06.700
Like three?

11:11:06.700 --> 11:11:07.700
Yeah, three

11:11:07.700 --> 11:11:10.700
I need to send one to myself

11:11:10.700 --> 11:11:13.700
I need to send one to myself

11:11:17.700 --> 11:11:19.700
Where is that?

11:11:19.700 --> 11:11:21.700
We've got mercy

11:11:23.700 --> 11:11:25.700
Okay, I'll go, go to site

11:11:29.700 --> 11:11:33.700
I can't wait for the day you break in

11:11:33.700 --> 11:11:39.700
and catch me watching another VTuber

11:11:39.700 --> 11:11:41.700
that isn't you

11:11:41.700 --> 11:11:44.700
It's one big mistake, of course

11:11:44.700 --> 11:11:49.700
but you can't help but become feral

11:11:49.700 --> 11:11:52.700
at the switch of a button

11:11:52.700 --> 11:11:55.700
No, you can't help but become feral at the site

11:11:55.700 --> 11:11:58.700
and completely enraged

11:11:58.700 --> 11:12:04.700
before you know it, we're, we're dancing

11:12:05.700 --> 11:12:10.700
Before you know it, we're, we're, well

11:12:10.700 --> 11:12:14.700
I don't have clothes, I don't have clothes

11:12:14.700 --> 11:12:19.700
clothes on in this scenario

11:12:19.700 --> 11:12:24.700
but you claim me as yours

11:12:24.700 --> 11:12:32.700
and it went and we both had a good time

11:12:32.700 --> 11:12:34.700
Thank you

11:12:34.700 --> 11:12:38.700
I don't even think that's English

11:12:38.700 --> 11:12:40.700
Okay, we're almost done

11:12:40.700 --> 11:12:43.700
Okay, surface, a little more surface

11:12:43.700 --> 11:12:45.700
Okay, one more

11:12:45.700 --> 11:12:47.700
Shibi

11:12:47.700 --> 11:12:50.700
Shibi, shibi, shibi, shibi

11:12:59.700 --> 11:13:01.700
Alright, Shibi

11:13:02.700 --> 11:13:04.700
Um

11:13:06.700 --> 11:13:08.700
Uh

11:13:10.700 --> 11:13:12.700
Well, I was going to be saying

11:13:12.700 --> 11:13:14.700
I'm going to bed because

11:13:14.700 --> 11:13:16.700
I'm so tired

11:13:16.700 --> 11:13:19.700
Shibi, shibi

11:13:19.700 --> 11:13:21.700
Mm

11:13:23.700 --> 11:13:25.700
Mm-hmm

11:13:27.700 --> 11:13:29.700
Shibi

11:13:30.700 --> 11:13:32.700
Shibi's a bunny rabbit

11:13:32.700 --> 11:13:34.700
Mm

11:13:35.700 --> 11:13:37.700
Mm-hmm

11:13:41.700 --> 11:13:43.700
Oh

11:13:44.700 --> 11:13:46.700
Mm-hmm

11:13:54.700 --> 11:13:56.700
Okay, we're done

11:13:56.700 --> 11:13:58.700
I can't do it anymore

11:14:00.700 --> 11:14:01.700
We're done

11:14:01.700 --> 11:14:04.700
I thought I got a good sleep

11:14:04.700 --> 11:14:07.700
I think I'm done refling

11:14:07.700 --> 11:14:10.700
I can't take any more

11:14:10.700 --> 11:14:13.700
You've outstaminated me refling

11:14:13.700 --> 11:14:15.700
I think I'm done

11:14:15.700 --> 11:14:18.700
I can't last any longer

11:14:18.700 --> 11:14:20.700
I'm sorry

11:14:20.700 --> 11:14:23.700
Will you forgive me for going to bed?

11:14:26.700 --> 11:14:29.700
I need to sleep a little bit more

11:14:29.700 --> 11:14:31.700
You've done enough surface maths

11:14:31.700 --> 11:14:32.700
and go to sleep

11:14:32.700 --> 11:14:34.700
I'm going to be like that for you

11:14:34.700 --> 11:14:36.700
Okay, refling

11:14:36.700 --> 11:14:39.700
I'm going to

11:14:39.700 --> 11:14:42.700
I'm going to go

11:14:42.700 --> 11:14:44.700
and sleep

11:14:45.700 --> 11:14:47.700
Um

11:14:49.700 --> 11:14:52.700
Thank you very much for hanging out with me

11:14:54.700 --> 11:14:56.700
You've been a good, giant-ass Uji-san

11:14:56.700 --> 11:14:59.700
that made lots of cake or whatever

11:15:00.700 --> 11:15:02.700
Good night, refling

11:15:02.700 --> 11:15:05.700
I'll see you tomorrow when I wake up

11:15:05.700 --> 11:15:08.700
once in a while

11:15:08.700 --> 11:15:09.700
Good night

11:15:09.700 --> 11:15:10.700
I'll dream

11:15:10.700 --> 11:15:12.700
I'll dream of us on the farm

11:15:12.700 --> 11:15:14.700
playing Connect 4

11:15:14.700 --> 11:15:15.700
and then I reach

11:15:15.700 --> 11:15:17.700
because I'm so bad at it

11:15:19.700 --> 11:15:21.700
Bye, refling

11:15:21.700 --> 11:15:24.700
See you at the mercy

11:15:24.700 --> 11:15:26.700
Okay

11:15:26.700 --> 11:15:28.700
I'm going to go to sleep

11:15:28.700 --> 11:15:30.700
Love you, refling

11:15:30.700 --> 11:15:32.700
I'll see you tomorrow

11:15:32.700 --> 11:15:34.700
Bye

11:15:34.700 --> 11:15:36.700
Go see

11:15:36.700 --> 11:15:40.700
Say hi to mercy

11:15:40.700 --> 11:15:43.700
Yes, mercy modis

11:15:43.700 --> 11:15:46.700
Goodbye, mercy

11:15:46.700 --> 11:15:47.700
Good night

11:15:47.700 --> 11:15:48.700
Bye, refling

11:15:48.700 --> 11:15:50.700
Love you, muah

11:15:50.700 --> 11:15:51.700
What?

11:15:51.700 --> 11:15:52.700
Yes

11:15:52.700 --> 11:15:54.700
Mercy time
