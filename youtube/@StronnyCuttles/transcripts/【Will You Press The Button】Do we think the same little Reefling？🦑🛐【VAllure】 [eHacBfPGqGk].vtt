00:00.000 --> 00:05.000
This? Okay.

00:05.000 --> 00:08.000
Wow.

00:08.000 --> 00:15.000
Me prancing and going sick.

00:15.000 --> 00:20.000
Where are my wheels?

00:20.000 --> 00:24.000
That was a stretch.

00:24.000 --> 00:28.000
That was like a random dinosaur noise I wanted to make.

00:28.000 --> 00:32.000
Hi. Good morning, good evening, good afternoon.

00:32.000 --> 00:36.000
Turns out I can actually be a lot louder than I first anticipated.

00:36.000 --> 00:41.000
My dad had no idea I streamed.

00:41.000 --> 00:45.000
So I finished the stream and I went back down.

00:45.000 --> 00:47.000
And I got off again.

00:47.000 --> 00:50.000
And obviously he was off at that point.

00:50.000 --> 00:54.000
And I was like, oh yeah, no, I enjoyed my stream.

00:54.000 --> 00:56.000
Sadly I was motion sick.

00:56.000 --> 00:59.000
And he was like, huh?

00:59.000 --> 01:00.000
He streamed.

01:00.000 --> 01:01.000
And I'm like, yeah, you didn't hear me.

01:01.000 --> 01:03.000
I was like having a carry on and stuff.

01:03.000 --> 01:05.000
But apparently he never heard nothing.

01:05.000 --> 01:10.000
So, well, I guess I can be a hell of a lot louder.

01:10.000 --> 01:14.000
And I will because yesterday I was like, I was ill as anything though.

01:14.000 --> 01:15.000
Thank you for understanding.

01:15.000 --> 01:20.000
I was so freaking ill.

01:20.000 --> 01:23.000
Yes, we're going to play this little silly goofy thing.

01:23.000 --> 01:25.000
It's called will you press the button?

01:25.000 --> 01:30.000
Basically, apparently it gives you scenarios and either you press it or not.

01:30.000 --> 01:38.000
And then it'll give you statistical percentages of who pressed it and who didn't.

01:38.000 --> 01:40.000
Is he a heavy sleeper?

01:40.000 --> 01:51.000
Yes, I thought because of the flight he basically passed out for ages.

01:51.000 --> 01:57.000
But yeah, we went to the shops and we got food.

01:57.000 --> 02:02.000
He was so mad at me for the food that I had in my fridge or the lack thereof.

02:02.000 --> 02:04.000
He was pissed.

02:04.000 --> 02:08.000
And I showed him the short that I made of Sheebie.

02:08.000 --> 02:10.000
So on my channel there's a short.

02:10.000 --> 02:15.000
And I'm like, if I had a willy, I know that Sheebie's design is a 10 out of 10.

02:15.000 --> 02:17.000
And I showed it to him.

02:17.000 --> 02:23.000
And he was like, oh, I didn't want to hear you talking about a willy.

02:23.000 --> 02:28.000
And I was like, damn, Papa Cuttle said no to food.

02:28.000 --> 02:31.000
Which is absolutely mean and both funny.

02:31.000 --> 02:33.000
But I showed him Amy's rats.

02:33.000 --> 02:35.000
I was like, all right, this is Amy.

02:35.000 --> 02:38.000
She has rats and they're adorable.

02:38.000 --> 02:40.000
And he found them quite funny.

02:40.000 --> 02:43.000
Esteban is his favorite rat for yanking all this stuff.

02:43.000 --> 02:46.000
Because there's a one point like Amy's doing something.

02:46.000 --> 02:48.000
And I think it's the burger one.

02:48.000 --> 02:52.000
And he's like, OK, we have a burger here and then Esteban yanks it.

02:52.000 --> 02:55.000
And she's like, we have half a burger.

03:00.000 --> 03:02.000
Please tell your dad to try and force you to enjoy.

03:02.000 --> 03:04.000
Oh, but he's cooking me steak.

03:04.000 --> 03:09.000
We went to the shops and he's like, right, you're eating better.

03:09.000 --> 03:10.000
What do you need?

03:10.000 --> 03:12.000
And I was like, well, I kind of need a steak, I guess.

03:13.000 --> 03:15.000
And we've got chicken to marinate overnight.

03:15.000 --> 03:17.000
I've never marinated a chicken before.

03:17.000 --> 03:19.000
That sounds like a marinate chicken.

03:19.000 --> 03:21.000
Like, no, I've not got time to marinate chicken

03:21.000 --> 03:23.000
and put it in a Ziploc bag.

03:23.000 --> 03:26.000
I had to buy Ziploc bags for the first time.

03:26.000 --> 03:28.000
I was like, what do I even need these for?

03:30.000 --> 03:32.000
The less he knows the better.

03:32.000 --> 03:34.000
Oh, no, he finds it hilarious what I do.

03:34.000 --> 03:36.000
Oh, my hell, yeah.

03:37.000 --> 03:38.000
Marinate.

03:38.000 --> 03:40.000
It's good to see you having a good time with your dad.

03:40.000 --> 03:41.000
Yeah.

03:41.000 --> 03:45.000
I was telling him about how you guys call him father-in-law.

03:45.000 --> 03:52.000
And he was like, oh, I don't know if he's going to write a letter for me to say on stream.

03:52.000 --> 03:55.000
I'll see if he wants to do it.

03:55.000 --> 03:57.000
He mentioned leaving you as a message.

03:57.000 --> 03:59.000
And I was like, do you mean like a physical one?

03:59.000 --> 04:00.000
Or like, what do you mean?

04:00.000 --> 04:02.000
Like, I need to take down the transcript.

04:04.000 --> 04:06.000
But he was like, no, no, I'll write.

04:06.000 --> 04:08.000
Oh, he approves of you guys.

04:08.000 --> 04:10.000
Oh, he approves of you all right.

04:12.000 --> 04:17.000
I was basically like, oh, so they're called Reflings.

04:19.000 --> 04:22.000
Because he still says Radish Boys, which is an old name.

04:22.000 --> 04:25.000
But yes, he's definitely three weeks of real food.

04:25.000 --> 04:26.000
Your body isn't going to know it.

04:26.000 --> 04:29.000
Literally, I'm going to have so many bill movements.

04:29.000 --> 04:31.000
But yes, today's just a chill stream.

04:31.000 --> 04:33.000
I'm just meming away.

04:33.000 --> 04:38.000
We're going to enjoy just, just chatting, doing our thing.

04:38.000 --> 04:40.000
There's no major rush for anything.

04:40.000 --> 04:42.000
And I believe Sheebie is on today.

04:42.000 --> 04:43.000
So we'll redirect into her.

04:43.000 --> 04:44.000
It's nice and chill.

04:44.000 --> 04:47.000
And then I'm going back to Charlotte.

04:49.000 --> 04:51.000
He's going to invite us for a mission next week.

04:51.000 --> 04:54.000
Oh, my dad's know the camping tape.

04:54.000 --> 04:57.000
Just say, what is my dad?

04:59.000 --> 05:00.000
Maybe I'll walk.

05:00.000 --> 05:02.000
Maybe a bit of the foodie.

05:02.000 --> 05:05.000
She's doing a member streamer for a regular streamer.

05:05.000 --> 05:08.000
Okay, well, someone else is getting redirected, isn't it?

05:08.000 --> 05:10.000
And it's not Sheebie.

05:10.000 --> 05:12.000
I'm sure there's someone we can find.

05:12.000 --> 05:15.000
I need to buy some more bait and tackle.

05:17.000 --> 05:19.000
What's this gamer tag?

05:19.000 --> 05:21.000
Oh, my God.

05:23.000 --> 05:27.000
Oh, he was talking to me about gaming because I was telling him,

05:27.000 --> 05:29.000
like, oh, I got to play cameo again.

05:29.000 --> 05:31.000
And he was like, you know what?

05:31.000 --> 05:33.000
Cameo was hitting my dad's got stronger accent.

05:33.000 --> 05:36.000
So he's like, oh, by the Pope.

05:36.000 --> 05:39.000
Mama, I vanquished a possum last night for you.

05:39.000 --> 05:42.000
He lived by the saying, you are what you eat.

05:42.000 --> 05:44.000
And he was eating roadkill.

05:44.000 --> 05:45.000
Strong enough.

05:45.000 --> 05:47.000
Are you kidding me right now?

05:47.000 --> 05:48.000
Oh, you eat?

05:48.000 --> 05:49.000
Wait, you killed a possum?

05:49.000 --> 05:50.000
I'm glad to hear he approves,

05:50.000 --> 05:53.000
but I'm going to work so not going to be interacting for now.

05:53.000 --> 05:55.000
Oh, don't worry if you have to work.

05:55.000 --> 05:56.000
Enjoy work.

05:56.000 --> 05:57.000
Make sure you hydrate.

05:57.000 --> 05:59.000
Thank you, Broly Legend for the tit.

05:59.000 --> 06:01.000
Orvon Biscotti.

06:01.000 --> 06:03.000
Thank you for the super chat.

06:03.000 --> 06:05.000
You killed a possum?

06:05.000 --> 06:07.000
You didn't have to perish him.

06:07.000 --> 06:09.000
He was just freaking doing it.

06:09.000 --> 06:12.000
Papa Cuddles is going to get stream sniped, honestly.

06:12.000 --> 06:13.000
Nah.

06:13.000 --> 06:18.000
Are possum bad in America?

06:18.000 --> 06:20.000
You're not supposed to perish the wildlife.

06:20.000 --> 06:22.000
You're supposed to feed it.

06:22.000 --> 06:26.000
I had, I fed the birds yesterday.

06:26.000 --> 06:27.000
Wah.

06:27.000 --> 06:28.000
I kid you not.

06:28.000 --> 06:32.000
There must have been a hundred birds in that garden.

06:32.000 --> 06:34.000
Listen, during work.

06:34.000 --> 06:37.000
Well, I'm not going to be acting up too much, so you probably can.

06:37.000 --> 06:40.000
This is probably the most say so I'm going to be for the next three weeks.

06:40.000 --> 06:41.000
Although I do have bad news.

06:41.000 --> 06:44.000
I don't think I can do that ASMR stream.

06:44.000 --> 06:46.000
That's planned tomorrow.

06:46.000 --> 06:51.000
I don't think I can actually do any ASMR stream for three weeks.

06:51.000 --> 06:56.000
I can literally hear the walls reverberating right now from my dad snoring.

06:56.000 --> 07:02.000
So yeah, I really don't want my dad's fart while he sleeps memorized.

07:02.000 --> 07:04.000
Clipped and shipped.

07:04.000 --> 07:07.000
As hilarious as that would be.

07:07.000 --> 07:09.000
That's rather weird to explain.

07:09.000 --> 07:12.000
Like, oh, dad, by the way.

07:12.000 --> 07:17.000
Someone clipped your fart whilst I was like streaming ASMR.

07:17.000 --> 07:20.000
Yeah, I don't really want that to go down in history.

07:20.000 --> 07:24.000
So I think we're going to pause on ASMR for three weeks.

07:24.000 --> 07:25.000
I know how boring.

07:25.000 --> 07:28.000
Oh, and the complete sabotage.

07:29.000 --> 07:33.000
But obviously I will make it up when my dad goes.

07:33.000 --> 07:36.000
I will keep you up to date when we're going to do it.

07:36.000 --> 07:37.000
It's all good.

07:37.000 --> 07:40.000
But seriously, okay, if you can't do it, it must have been the wind.

07:40.000 --> 07:48.000
Honestly, the freaking walls are vibrating from how intense his snoring is.

07:48.000 --> 07:50.000
Old man fart ASMR.

07:50.000 --> 07:53.000
Honestly, imagine me try to be all cute in that.

07:53.000 --> 07:57.000
And then you just hear like meh in the background like, okay, you're done.

07:57.000 --> 08:00.000
Make sure you hide all your figures well.

08:00.000 --> 08:03.000
Oh, I fucking made sure that was done.

08:05.000 --> 08:08.000
The perfect set up for don't wake up appearance.

08:08.000 --> 08:09.000
My dear sibling ace.

08:09.000 --> 08:13.000
Hey, yo, you thinking like a pin pal here?

08:15.000 --> 08:19.000
Chill three weeks and then endurance marathon after marathon after marathon.

08:19.000 --> 08:20.000
Yeah, pretty much that's the plan.

08:20.000 --> 08:21.000
It all looks good to me.

08:21.000 --> 08:27.000
Well, surely that was a lot of stuff that even the thought of it is like, oh, no.

08:30.000 --> 08:32.000
I'm having me cup of tea.

08:36.000 --> 08:38.000
Wait, you need to try and be cute.

08:38.000 --> 08:42.000
Well, so whenever I do like ASMR, I feel a lot of pressure.

08:42.000 --> 08:46.000
Actually, like when I do it live, I don't know how to explain it.

08:46.000 --> 08:49.000
I don't get like stage fright or anything.

08:49.000 --> 08:53.000
But I feel like with ASMR, I can't really be my goblino self.

08:53.000 --> 08:57.000
It normally does end up me just straight up talking to you by the end of it.

08:57.000 --> 09:02.000
But I feel like I have to try and choose my words carefully to not ruin the ambiance

09:02.000 --> 09:04.000
or what's going on type thing.

09:04.000 --> 09:05.000
I'm not a pin pal.

09:05.000 --> 09:06.000
I'm loyal to my mate.

09:06.000 --> 09:07.000
Okay, I'm sorry.

09:07.000 --> 09:08.000
I'm sorry.

09:08.000 --> 09:10.000
I never doubted you for a second.

09:13.000 --> 09:14.000
What?

09:14.000 --> 09:17.000
ASMR, your Scottish girlfriend brought you to meet her parents

09:17.000 --> 09:20.000
and she's trying to relax you while her dad snores louder than a motorcycle on the net.

09:20.000 --> 09:22.000
No, because it's true.

09:22.000 --> 09:23.000
It's actually true.

09:23.000 --> 09:26.000
Like, I was gonna play Ring Fit next week.

09:26.000 --> 09:28.000
Next week, I'm playing a lot of Nintendo games

09:28.000 --> 09:31.000
because I found my Ildeado.

09:33.000 --> 09:34.000
I'm gonna...

09:34.000 --> 09:39.000
I don't know what kind of choke hold that Sakuya game,

09:39.000 --> 09:42.000
the fruit game on Nintendo has on VTubers,

09:42.000 --> 09:45.000
but I'm joining the ranks and seeing what that game's all about.

09:45.000 --> 09:47.000
I swear to God, if I'm about to spend,

09:47.000 --> 09:49.000
I don't know how much it costs,

09:49.000 --> 09:53.000
if I'm about to spend a ridiculous amount of money on this little Nintendo fruit game

09:53.000 --> 09:56.000
and it's absolutely the most piss-borne thing I've ever played,

09:56.000 --> 10:00.000
all VTubers unanimously are getting bent over my knee and spanked

10:00.000 --> 10:03.000
because you all make that game look so addicting.

10:03.000 --> 10:06.000
Everyone in their nan was playing that game

10:06.000 --> 10:08.000
and you all made it look so addicting.

10:08.000 --> 10:11.000
So I swear, I swear.

10:12.000 --> 10:15.000
If I pay three quid, three whole quid,

10:15.000 --> 10:18.000
someone says in that game's piss,

10:18.000 --> 10:20.000
everyone's getting spanked.

10:20.000 --> 10:22.000
Everyone unanimously, okay?

10:22.000 --> 10:25.000
Johnny's 100% getting addicted to it as much as Belchro.

10:25.000 --> 10:28.000
Is that actually becoming a VTuber right now?

10:28.000 --> 10:31.000
Okay, I'll spank the VTubers,

10:31.000 --> 10:34.000
but I'll ink you guys from behind

10:34.000 --> 10:37.000
if it was you guys that said that it was a good game, okay?

10:38.000 --> 10:41.000
I never got the sucker hype.

10:41.000 --> 10:43.000
I don't even know how to say it.

10:48.000 --> 10:50.000
Three quid to US dollar.

10:50.000 --> 10:52.000
I don't, er, fucking six dollars.

10:52.000 --> 10:55.000
I think, well, the old conversion rate was great,

10:55.000 --> 10:57.000
British pounds to dollars was two,

10:57.000 --> 11:00.000
the other way about one to two.

11:00.000 --> 11:02.000
I always said it like,

11:03.000 --> 11:06.000
Get that watermelon.

11:06.000 --> 11:08.000
Aye, so we're going to play that next week.

11:08.000 --> 11:11.000
The Streams Dave game's going to be Mario Kart.

11:11.000 --> 11:13.000
Who goes there? Identify yourself.

11:13.000 --> 11:16.000
And then I was going to do Ring Fit as well

11:16.000 --> 11:18.000
because I need some exercise.

11:18.000 --> 11:20.000
I walked to the shops with my dad.

11:20.000 --> 11:22.000
Motherfucker, I was telling him to slow down

11:22.000 --> 11:24.000
and I'm like, fucking hell, I'm a gamer.

11:24.000 --> 11:26.000
You need to relax, dad.

11:26.000 --> 11:28.000
Like, relax, I'm in no rush.

11:28.000 --> 11:30.000
I got to show my magpies

11:30.000 --> 11:33.000
and there's also a crow I am now feeding.

11:33.000 --> 11:35.000
So I got to show him that and he was like,

11:35.000 --> 11:37.000
oh, damn, that crow's pretty badass.

11:37.000 --> 11:39.000
And I'm like, yeah, me and dad both have the bird autism.

11:39.000 --> 11:41.000
We're like, yeah, birds are cool.

11:41.000 --> 11:44.000
I'm like, yeah, yeah.

11:44.000 --> 11:46.000
Honestly, we're the same damn person.

11:46.000 --> 11:49.000
We were like, watch Star Trek last night

11:49.000 --> 11:52.000
and I have something very adorable.

11:52.000 --> 11:54.000
I'm going to cry if I think about it too much.

11:54.000 --> 11:58.000
My mom found my childhood toy

11:58.000 --> 12:00.000
and I'm going to take a picture and you can all see it.

12:00.000 --> 12:04.000
It needs a big wash, but his name is Charlie

12:04.000 --> 12:07.000
and he's a wee monkey and I absolutely adore him.

12:07.000 --> 12:13.000
So, yeah, I was like, oh, did you bring me any books?

12:13.000 --> 12:15.000
Because last time my dad visited me,

12:15.000 --> 12:17.000
he brought me books all my family.

12:17.000 --> 12:20.000
I asked my family, like, oh, if you have any favourite books,

12:20.000 --> 12:23.000
please just give them to my dad and he'll give them to me.

12:23.000 --> 12:25.000
And he was like, no, sorry, no books this time.

12:25.000 --> 12:27.000
And I'm like, oh, no, that's fine, that's fine, don't worry about it.

12:27.000 --> 12:30.000
And then he's like, oh, but there is one thing though.

12:30.000 --> 12:32.000
And he whips out Charlie from behind them

12:32.000 --> 12:35.000
and I was like, you know if I wasn't so violently motion sick,

12:35.000 --> 12:38.000
I'll right now, I would burst out in tears.

12:38.000 --> 12:42.000
I have not seen my childhood Teddy since I was about 12 or something.

12:42.000 --> 12:47.000
And I sent my mom a text and I was like, you found Charlie

12:47.000 --> 12:50.000
and she's not replied to me yet, but oh my God,

12:50.000 --> 12:53.000
I've got my childhood toy and I love them to smithereens.

12:53.000 --> 12:58.000
And I remember he's got a little toy, he's got a speaker in him

12:58.000 --> 13:02.000
and he goes, because he's a monkey.

13:02.000 --> 13:05.000
They love monkeys. I love gorillas.

13:05.000 --> 13:10.000
Shout out to any viewer named Charlie right now, literally.

13:10.000 --> 13:13.000
Charlie's not a cat. Charlie's a monkey.

13:13.000 --> 13:15.000
Return to monkey.

13:15.000 --> 13:18.000
But I'll take a little photo of him

13:18.000 --> 13:21.000
and I can show you my childhood toy.

13:22.000 --> 13:26.000
Maybe someone from the UK might have a Charlie too.

13:26.000 --> 13:27.000
It's Charlie on your bed.

13:27.000 --> 13:32.000
No, I have to put Charlie away in case Gimli and Vigil destroy him.

13:32.000 --> 13:35.000
I don't want any trouble. I don't want any trouble.

13:37.000 --> 13:40.000
My uncle did a funny, he gave me a toy monkey as a kid

13:40.000 --> 13:42.000
and told me his name was Spank.

13:42.000 --> 13:45.000
You guys spank the monkey.

13:45.000 --> 13:47.000
Oh wait, no, that's, you guys taught me,

13:47.000 --> 13:50.000
that doesn't mean what I think it means.

13:50.000 --> 13:54.000
Monka? Monka? Are you okay?

13:54.000 --> 13:57.000
I feel that passing down a childhood bear to my kid.

13:57.000 --> 14:00.000
Oh, honestly, I'm so happy with Charlie.

14:00.000 --> 14:02.000
I was like, honestly, if I didn't feel so violently sick,

14:02.000 --> 14:04.000
I would have burst out crying there.

14:07.000 --> 14:09.000
Yes, I remember what it means though,

14:09.000 --> 14:11.000
but I forgot what I meant yesterday.

14:11.000 --> 14:13.000
I'm sorry, I didn't know.

14:13.000 --> 14:15.000
I didn't know any better.

14:15.000 --> 14:17.000
Okay, great.

14:17.000 --> 14:20.000
I actually played this game before I end up just turning into a rant,

14:20.000 --> 14:23.000
a rant, a ramble about everything and anything.

14:23.000 --> 14:25.000
Pardon me, boys.

14:25.000 --> 14:27.000
Right.

14:27.000 --> 14:34.000
Oh, I can also make that short about how much money I earn.

14:34.000 --> 14:37.000
I was explaining to my dad, like, oh,

14:37.000 --> 14:40.000
I'm going to make this short because I'm showing him what,

14:40.000 --> 14:41.000
he knows what YouTube shorts are,

14:41.000 --> 14:44.000
but I was just showing him like, oh, because I'm a,

14:44.000 --> 14:48.000
I was like, all right, you're getting dusted upon the world of VTubers,

14:48.000 --> 14:50.000
and I showed him like Rin Penrose's stuff,

14:50.000 --> 14:52.000
and I was like, see how it's all like insider knowledge.

14:52.000 --> 14:54.000
Like, people are genuinely interested in the ins and outs

14:54.000 --> 14:56.000
of like, how being a VTuber is.

14:56.000 --> 15:00.000
And I was saying to him, like, I'm going to show my income for the month,

15:00.000 --> 15:01.000
and he was like, is that wise?

15:01.000 --> 15:03.000
Like, aren't people going to think you're bragging?

15:03.000 --> 15:05.000
And I'm like, no, it's not for bragging.

15:05.000 --> 15:10.000
It's to show like, this is how much you, you know, you can earn.

15:10.000 --> 15:13.000
Fucking put your head down and, you know,

15:13.000 --> 15:15.000
work your booty off type thing.

15:15.000 --> 15:18.000
And I was like, a lot of it is also, you have to remember,

15:18.000 --> 15:22.000
YouTube generates like free money when people watch VODs back

15:22.000 --> 15:24.000
and the ASMR videos, for example.

15:24.000 --> 15:26.000
But anyway, shut the fuck up, Johnny.

15:26.000 --> 15:27.000
No one cares.

15:29.000 --> 15:32.000
You'll get a short soon about how much I earned in my first month of it all.

15:34.000 --> 15:36.000
I've a Gen 2 update.

15:37.000 --> 15:39.000
Five.

15:42.000 --> 15:45.000
One of them is a very unique design.

15:48.000 --> 15:50.000
A female concept artist.

15:50.000 --> 15:56.000
The chick concept artist is giving me her batch by August 1st.

15:56.000 --> 15:59.000
We've just received the second one from her.

15:59.000 --> 16:03.000
And we are looking fucking solid.

16:03.000 --> 16:04.000
That's all I'm saying.

16:04.000 --> 16:07.000
Sorry, I just sucked my finger because I opened up a can of cola.

16:07.000 --> 16:09.000
But five designs have been...

16:09.000 --> 16:11.000
What is going on with my cola?

16:11.000 --> 16:13.000
Is there all exploding recently?

16:18.000 --> 16:19.000
Unique in a good way?

16:19.000 --> 16:20.000
Oh, unique in a good way.

16:22.000 --> 16:26.000
I don't think there's like absolutely nothing where someone's like,

16:26.000 --> 16:28.000
this person looks like this person.

16:28.000 --> 16:29.000
No, get to fuck.

16:29.000 --> 16:31.000
And then two, there's no one that's got the same bloody lore.

16:31.000 --> 16:32.000
I can tell you that much.

16:32.000 --> 16:34.000
Coca-Cola for Gen 3.

16:35.000 --> 16:39.000
Although the concept artist was fucking pranking me, man.

16:39.000 --> 16:41.000
It goes horse.

16:41.000 --> 16:43.000
I'm like, no, absolutely not.

16:43.000 --> 16:44.000
And it goes unicorn.

16:44.000 --> 16:46.000
No, absolutely not.

16:46.000 --> 16:49.000
Do not fucking turn around and give me a bloody unicorn.

16:49.000 --> 16:52.000
I swear, God, I was getting raging.

16:55.000 --> 16:58.000
But the female concept artist, she's giving me too.

16:59.000 --> 17:01.000
I look very adorable.

17:01.000 --> 17:02.000
I'm just waiting.

17:02.000 --> 17:05.000
No, no fucking horse confirmed.

17:05.000 --> 17:06.000
No horse, no unicorn.

17:06.000 --> 17:07.000
Donkey.

17:07.000 --> 17:10.000
Mule, you guys are such trolls.

17:10.000 --> 17:12.000
I'll spoil a stream that's coming up.

17:12.000 --> 17:16.000
I'm drawing your shitty suggestions for Gen 2 live on MS Paint.

17:16.000 --> 17:21.000
We're doing that not next week, but the week after the first one.

17:21.000 --> 17:26.000
So you guys can literally write what you want and I'm going to draw it live.

17:27.000 --> 17:29.000
And then I'll show you what your line-up's going to look like.

17:29.000 --> 17:31.000
I'm going to take a screenshot.

17:31.000 --> 17:34.000
And then next year, when they actually come out, I'm going to be like,

17:34.000 --> 17:36.000
hmm, I wonder whose suggestions were better.

17:36.000 --> 17:37.000
Mine are yours.

17:37.000 --> 17:39.000
Who goes there?

17:39.000 --> 17:40.000
Pegasus.

17:40.000 --> 17:42.000
Oh, no.

17:42.000 --> 17:46.000
But show me a roly-poly vetiver.

17:46.000 --> 17:49.000
She's going to draw a million slime girls.

17:49.000 --> 17:52.000
Honestly, I'm going to be like, what color do you want the slime girl?

17:52.000 --> 17:54.000
Pick a color.

17:55.000 --> 17:56.000
Emu.

17:56.000 --> 17:57.000
Emu.

17:57.000 --> 18:00.000
She'd have to be Aussie if it was an Emu.

18:02.000 --> 18:03.000
We get to comment on your drawing.

18:03.000 --> 18:05.000
Oh, you can annihilate my drawing skills.

18:05.000 --> 18:06.000
I don't have any.

18:06.000 --> 18:10.000
Literally, the title of the stream is like drawing Gen 2 suggestions,

18:10.000 --> 18:12.000
but I never learned to draw.

18:12.000 --> 18:14.000
I never put those down.

18:14.000 --> 18:16.000
Although that would be a fun idea.

18:16.000 --> 18:19.000
All the other girls have like fucking capabilities to doodle or doosh it.

18:19.000 --> 18:21.000
I'm going to have to tell them like,

18:21.000 --> 18:25.000
hey, go have some fun streams.

18:25.000 --> 18:28.000
Emu couldn't be Aussie after the war.

18:28.000 --> 18:29.000
Cephalopod.

18:29.000 --> 18:31.000
Vetiver when?

18:33.000 --> 18:36.000
Kangaroo girl on Alpaca.

18:36.000 --> 18:38.000
And Alpaca, no.

18:38.000 --> 18:40.000
Right, when we actually do this,

18:40.000 --> 18:42.000
the whole reason we're here today,

18:42.000 --> 18:44.000
your doodles are cute.

18:44.000 --> 18:46.000
Did you like the DEMPA birthday card on Twitter?

18:46.000 --> 18:48.000
Oh my god, I can be a real streamer.

18:48.000 --> 18:50.000
Please remember to like and subscribe,

18:50.000 --> 18:53.000
even though I've not done the thing I said I was going to do.

18:53.000 --> 18:54.000
Smile.

18:54.000 --> 18:55.000
A honey badger.

18:55.000 --> 18:57.000
Honey badger, don't give up.

18:57.000 --> 18:59.000
Giraffe with that long neck?

18:59.000 --> 19:00.000
Absolutely not.

19:00.000 --> 19:04.000
Okay, you can change your physical appearance in any way at any time,

19:04.000 --> 19:06.000
including swapping genders,

19:06.000 --> 19:10.000
but you will never be able to look the same way twice.

19:10.000 --> 19:13.000
I feel like that is like so minuscule.

19:13.000 --> 19:14.000
Like it could be like, yeah,

19:14.000 --> 19:16.000
I want an extra freckle on my butt cheek.

19:16.000 --> 19:18.000
Like, I feel like that's so minuscule,

19:18.000 --> 19:20.000
it's not even necessary.

19:20.000 --> 19:22.000
I'd press, yeah, I'd press the crap out of that.

19:22.000 --> 19:24.000
Do you know how much money I could make on only fans

19:24.000 --> 19:26.000
with this ability?

19:28.000 --> 19:31.000
Literally, I'm pressing the shit out of that.

19:32.000 --> 19:38.000
Yeah, I was, I think these people have overthunk it by far.

19:38.000 --> 19:40.000
27% have overthunk it.

19:40.000 --> 19:42.000
Literally, you could be like, yeah,

19:42.000 --> 19:44.000
I want a freckle in between my toes.

19:44.000 --> 19:46.000
That's different, okay?

19:46.000 --> 19:48.000
They played themselves.

19:48.000 --> 19:50.000
Okay?

19:53.000 --> 19:56.000
100% would press, no brainer.

19:56.000 --> 20:00.000
This could be exploited to basically rule the world.

20:00.000 --> 20:03.000
You have the ability to cure cancer with touch,

20:03.000 --> 20:05.000
but you will die of cancer.

20:05.000 --> 20:08.000
See, now, there's no...

20:08.000 --> 20:09.000
Oh my god, I can...

20:09.000 --> 20:11.000
Oh my god, that's a white one, guys.

20:11.000 --> 20:13.000
I can open them up.

20:14.000 --> 20:16.000
So, it says you'll die of cancer,

20:16.000 --> 20:18.000
but it doesn't give a timeline.

20:18.000 --> 20:19.000
And I'm not being funny.

20:19.000 --> 20:21.000
Odds are, you actually do perish from cancer

20:21.000 --> 20:22.000
the older you get.

20:22.000 --> 20:24.000
Other than Alzheimer's.

20:24.000 --> 20:26.000
Alzheimer's will fucking grab your brain

20:26.000 --> 20:28.000
and shake it real good and make it full of protein

20:28.000 --> 20:31.000
so it doesn't function and you stop eating, basically.

20:32.000 --> 20:35.000
Yeah, see, because it doesn't specify die immediately,

20:35.000 --> 20:38.000
I'm like, I could probably get a good solid 80 years

20:38.000 --> 20:42.000
on this planet before the microplastics just annihilate me.

20:43.000 --> 20:47.000
Until it's over for me and all the lead and the clothes and that.

20:49.000 --> 20:53.000
I think sacrifice for the gain of others as well

20:53.000 --> 20:55.000
is quite a noble thing.

20:55.000 --> 20:59.000
Like, you know, my life is never going to amount to anything,

20:59.000 --> 21:02.000
so if I could just cut about in the hospitals for a bit,

21:02.000 --> 21:05.000
sure, fuck it, press that shit.

21:06.000 --> 21:10.000
Oh wow, 40% said no.

21:13.000 --> 21:15.000
St. Strawny, let him know.

21:17.000 --> 21:18.000
Whatever comforts you, okay?

21:18.000 --> 21:20.000
Whatever comforts you.

21:23.000 --> 21:26.000
Altruistic question.

21:26.000 --> 21:28.000
Cure everyone else but die a few years later.

21:28.000 --> 21:32.000
Yeah, I feel like, because my life ain't going to be, you know,

21:32.000 --> 21:35.000
about on general modification.

21:35.000 --> 21:39.000
Delicious lead and microplastic lunchables.

21:39.000 --> 21:41.000
Okay, sandy clothes is real.

21:41.000 --> 21:45.000
Every other holiday, you know, never get celebrated again.

21:45.000 --> 21:48.000
If, okay, that's definitely not the dad's up,

21:48.000 --> 21:50.000
I guess I'll open them up.

21:50.000 --> 21:53.000
I mean, like, oh, my dad sleeps through everything.

21:53.000 --> 21:55.000
My dad who's literally slamming the cupboards right now.

21:55.000 --> 21:57.000
Okay, Santa Claus is real,

21:57.000 --> 22:00.000
but every other holiday, you know, does they get celebrated?

22:00.000 --> 22:02.000
What are their other holidays?

22:02.000 --> 22:05.000
Valentine's Day, you could be romantic any day of the week

22:05.000 --> 22:07.000
to me, Refland.

22:07.000 --> 22:10.000
Santa spawns capitalistic.

22:10.000 --> 22:16.000
Santa Claus is actually just a capitalistic front

22:16.000 --> 22:19.000
to part with more of your money and put yourself in debt

22:19.000 --> 22:21.000
to the credit card companies.

22:21.000 --> 22:23.000
I will not press that button.

22:23.000 --> 22:25.000
Fuck you.

22:26.000 --> 22:28.000
Damn straight.

22:28.000 --> 22:30.000
That's right, my people rise up.

22:30.000 --> 22:34.000
We identify against the capitalist pigs of society.

22:34.000 --> 22:36.000
How dare you?

22:37.000 --> 22:40.000
Okay, all food tastes twice as good,

22:40.000 --> 22:43.000
but you're permanently constipated.

22:43.000 --> 22:46.000
Oh, no. Wait a minute.

22:46.000 --> 22:49.000
I really like food though.

22:49.000 --> 22:53.000
Oh, no.

22:53.000 --> 23:00.000
Did I get to relieve myself with my booty?

23:00.000 --> 23:04.000
My wee douche, my wee pot douche?

23:04.000 --> 23:07.000
No, it's not worth it. I mean, you're always constipated anyway.

23:07.000 --> 23:11.000
Yeah, I was going to say, like, I mean,

23:11.000 --> 23:13.000
this is literally me right now.

23:13.000 --> 23:17.000
I really enjoy food, so I think I already have enhanced taste points.

23:17.000 --> 23:20.000
And then, like, if ever, you know, get constipated,

23:20.000 --> 23:23.000
I'm just like, oh, just squish some water on my boot.

23:23.000 --> 23:25.000
That's as simple as.

23:25.000 --> 23:27.000
Time to break out the colossal thing.

23:27.000 --> 23:31.000
Wait, don't you just implode you would die out of the food?

23:31.000 --> 23:33.000
I don't think I need it, actually.

23:33.000 --> 23:35.000
I think food's already enhanced for me.

23:35.000 --> 23:37.000
I will not. I will refrain, because I don't want to be full.

23:37.000 --> 23:38.000
Oh, wow. Okay.

23:38.000 --> 23:40.000
74% agreed.

23:40.000 --> 23:42.000
Mmm.

23:42.000 --> 23:44.000
Damn straight.

23:44.000 --> 23:47.000
You save the world and make it a better place,

23:47.000 --> 23:51.000
but you go down in history as a bad person?

23:51.000 --> 23:54.000
I mean,

23:54.000 --> 23:58.000
if you save the world and make it a better place,

23:58.000 --> 24:02.000
again, this is the nation and good of the people,

24:02.000 --> 24:05.000
but if you go down as a bad person in history,

24:05.000 --> 24:08.000
I mean, think of how much history gets lost to time.

24:08.000 --> 24:12.000
Like, name one fact in the 1300s.

24:12.000 --> 24:15.000
Go. Like, you cannae off the top of your head.

24:15.000 --> 24:19.000
History continues to develop,

24:19.000 --> 24:22.000
and people are forgotten, and that's just how life is.

24:22.000 --> 24:24.000
It's not a big deal to be forgotten,

24:24.000 --> 24:26.000
and if you're remembered as a bad person,

24:26.000 --> 24:27.000
guess what?

24:27.000 --> 24:29.000
Every time someone dies,

24:29.000 --> 24:31.000
the percentage of people that know you and are aware of you

24:31.000 --> 24:34.000
are just so unlikely.

24:34.000 --> 24:36.000
You know?

24:36.000 --> 24:39.000
So don't worry about being remembered as a baddie, okay?

24:39.000 --> 24:42.000
Save the planet, my final message.

24:42.000 --> 24:44.000
Goodbye.

24:44.000 --> 24:46.000
Will you press the button?

24:46.000 --> 24:48.000
You will get super ability to read minds.

24:48.000 --> 24:51.000
I can already do that with the reeflings.

24:51.000 --> 24:54.000
If you read their mind for too long,

24:54.000 --> 24:56.000
they know you're doing it.

24:56.000 --> 24:58.000
Are you joking me? That's the best thing ever.

24:58.000 --> 25:00.000
Can you know how much torment I can do with you?

25:00.000 --> 25:03.000
I'd be like, I know what you're thinking, reefling.

25:03.000 --> 25:04.000
And then you know that.

25:04.000 --> 25:07.000
You know that I know that you're thinking of certain things.

25:07.000 --> 25:08.000
How is that any bad?

25:08.000 --> 25:10.000
That's not bad at all.

25:10.000 --> 25:11.000
That is not bad.

25:11.000 --> 25:15.000
Literally, whoever said 16%, come on.

25:15.000 --> 25:19.000
Imagine how red your face is gonna go.

25:19.000 --> 25:20.000
You're gonna be blushing.

25:20.000 --> 25:23.000
You're gonna be blushing.

25:23.000 --> 25:25.000
You're just gonna love every second of it.

25:25.000 --> 25:27.000
Mommy, please, I can't right now.

25:27.000 --> 25:29.000
Can you control when you do it?

25:29.000 --> 25:32.000
If so, 100% yeah.

25:32.000 --> 25:34.000
Oh, hydration check.

25:34.000 --> 25:36.000
I'm getting, getting, getting.

25:36.000 --> 25:38.000
Oh.

25:38.000 --> 25:41.000
I agree that some people's thinking my ball,

25:41.000 --> 25:43.000
but I would never stop thinking with things.

25:43.000 --> 25:45.000
What they're gonna do is stop thinking exactly.

25:45.000 --> 25:48.000
Although apparently guys can like zone out really easily.

25:48.000 --> 25:50.000
So maybe you just need to like zone out.

25:50.000 --> 25:52.000
And I'm like, damn, I can't get nothing off of you.

25:53.000 --> 25:54.000
I'd use that against you.

25:54.000 --> 25:55.000
I could make,

25:55.000 --> 25:57.000
I could think of things that would make you blush.

25:57.000 --> 25:58.000
Okay, no, I'm here for it.

25:58.000 --> 26:01.000
I'm here for that kind of reverse psychology.

26:01.000 --> 26:03.000
You can perfectly torment someone

26:03.000 --> 26:05.000
because you know what their picture in.

26:05.000 --> 26:08.000
I'm zoning out right now.

26:08.000 --> 26:12.000
I just started thinking of me.

26:12.000 --> 26:13.000
Sorry, I'm dumb.

26:13.000 --> 26:15.000
You can't get anything from my mind.

26:15.000 --> 26:16.000
Oh, yeah.

26:16.000 --> 26:18.000
Ah, yes, or nothing box.

26:18.000 --> 26:21.000
Being empty-headed is just male superiority.

26:21.000 --> 26:24.000
My strongest skill versus strong disassociation.

26:24.000 --> 26:27.000
I cast this association.

26:27.000 --> 26:28.000
Okay.

26:28.000 --> 26:30.000
Everyone in your family would be taking care of

26:30.000 --> 26:31.000
for the rest of their lives,

26:31.000 --> 26:33.000
but you will be homeless for the rest of your lives.

26:33.000 --> 26:35.000
I have terrible news for you,

26:35.000 --> 26:37.000
but already take care of my family.

26:37.000 --> 26:41.000
I will not press that button.

26:41.000 --> 26:43.000
The fam are good.

26:43.000 --> 26:45.000
Yeah, I was gonna say that's quite a high percentage.

26:45.000 --> 26:47.000
I mean, I guess you could get around it

26:47.000 --> 26:49.000
and being like Colin, you can be homeless.

26:49.000 --> 26:53.000
You can never own a house under your legal name

26:53.000 --> 26:55.000
if you want to get technical like that.

26:55.000 --> 26:57.000
But already look after the fam,

26:57.000 --> 26:59.000
so that was a much of a thing.

26:59.000 --> 27:02.000
Homeless, no mad lifestyle in a van.

27:02.000 --> 27:03.000
I've seen that.

27:03.000 --> 27:05.000
The rise of people living in a van.

27:05.000 --> 27:07.000
I've seen that.

27:07.000 --> 27:09.000
I've seen a few tech talks about it

27:09.000 --> 27:12.000
and they're like, van life is good for me and all of that.

27:12.000 --> 27:15.000
Yeah, homeless doesn't necessarily mean it in a house.

27:15.000 --> 27:17.000
I agree, I agree.

27:17.000 --> 27:18.000
Yeah.

27:18.000 --> 27:21.000
And like obviously you have the freedom to bop about in that van

27:21.000 --> 27:23.000
and you didn't have to pay like property taxes

27:23.000 --> 27:25.000
or nothing on that bad boy

27:25.000 --> 27:27.000
because you're living in a van.

27:27.000 --> 27:29.000
I don't know how you get mail though.

27:29.000 --> 27:31.000
Like if you need mail.

27:31.000 --> 27:32.000
Okay.

27:32.000 --> 27:38.000
You can bring any musician from the dead for one last show.

27:38.000 --> 27:42.000
You won't be able to see and hear it.

27:42.000 --> 27:46.000
I mean, if it's something for people to enjoy,

27:46.000 --> 27:49.000
I don't always have to enjoy everything myself.

27:49.000 --> 27:52.000
I can appreciate other people enjoying it.

27:52.000 --> 27:53.000
You know?

27:53.000 --> 27:56.000
If someone wants big beef oven to come out of the ground,

27:56.000 --> 27:57.000
go for it.

27:57.000 --> 27:58.000
You know?

27:58.000 --> 28:01.000
I'm not going to ruin the night for someone else

28:01.000 --> 28:03.000
just because I can't even get the goods of it.

28:03.000 --> 28:04.000
Like relax.

28:04.000 --> 28:05.000
Why would you say no?

28:05.000 --> 28:07.000
There's literally no downside.

28:07.000 --> 28:09.000
I mean, you could sync up on,

28:09.000 --> 28:11.000
like literally you can have headphones in

28:11.000 --> 28:15.000
and sync up the music to what it's supposed to be.

28:15.000 --> 28:16.000
Relax.

28:16.000 --> 28:18.000
Why is everyone so selfish?

28:18.000 --> 28:19.000
That's a shame.

28:19.000 --> 28:21.000
Imagine they off themselves and they were forced,

28:21.000 --> 28:24.000
they off themselves and they're forced to come back.

28:24.000 --> 28:25.000
Oh wait.

28:25.000 --> 28:27.000
Did beef oven take his life?

28:27.000 --> 28:28.000
Beethoven?

28:29.000 --> 28:30.000
I don't know.

28:30.000 --> 28:31.000
Monkers.

28:31.000 --> 28:32.000
Meatloafs.

28:33.000 --> 28:36.000
You go back in time and change one thing in history,

28:36.000 --> 28:38.000
but you remain to the timeline.

28:38.000 --> 28:41.000
You return to your timeline at any given moment.

28:42.000 --> 28:43.000
Wait.

28:43.000 --> 28:44.000
So like in theory,

28:44.000 --> 28:46.000
I could be 80 years old in the past

28:46.000 --> 28:47.000
and then it puts me back here.

28:47.000 --> 28:48.000
I kind of be AA.

28:48.000 --> 28:49.000
It'd be like,

28:49.000 --> 28:50.000
Reflings.

28:50.000 --> 28:51.000
Reflings.

28:51.000 --> 28:52.000
Do you like gilf?

28:52.000 --> 28:53.000
Do you like gilfs?

28:53.000 --> 28:54.000
I'd take two-third.

28:56.000 --> 28:57.000
I don't think I can hit that.

28:57.000 --> 28:58.000
I'm like,

28:58.000 --> 28:59.000
sorry,

28:59.000 --> 29:00.000
but I need to be with the Reflings.

29:00.000 --> 29:01.000
Born too late to,

29:01.000 --> 29:02.000
I don't know,

29:02.000 --> 29:03.000
C-sutton.

29:03.000 --> 29:05.000
Born too early to C-sutton in the future.

29:05.000 --> 29:06.000
Born at the right time.

29:06.000 --> 29:07.000
I don't know.

29:07.000 --> 29:08.000
I don't know.

29:08.000 --> 29:09.000
I don't know.

29:10.000 --> 29:12.000
Born at the right time to have my Reflings.

29:12.000 --> 29:13.000
I'm not pressing.

29:13.000 --> 29:15.000
I'm not touching anything with the timeline.

29:15.000 --> 29:16.000
I'm keeping it the way it is.

29:16.000 --> 29:17.000
I like this timeline.

29:17.000 --> 29:18.000
I want to stay on it.

29:18.000 --> 29:20.000
I want to be with my Reflings.

29:20.000 --> 29:21.000
I got,

29:21.000 --> 29:22.000
I got the happy ending.

29:22.000 --> 29:23.000
Okay.

29:23.000 --> 29:24.000
I got the happy ending.

29:24.000 --> 29:25.000
Take care of Granny.

29:25.000 --> 29:28.000
Would you love me with Granny Strongzo?

29:28.000 --> 29:29.000
Oh,

29:29.000 --> 29:30.000
would the sweetie,

29:30.000 --> 29:31.000
would,

29:31.000 --> 29:32.000
oh wait,

29:32.000 --> 29:33.000
I don't know why I'm fucking turning English.

29:33.000 --> 29:34.000
Oh,

29:34.000 --> 29:36.000
would the sweetie like Sa Sweetie?

29:36.000 --> 29:37.000
Yeah.

29:37.000 --> 29:40.000
You want to suck on my hard boiled sweet day?

29:43.000 --> 29:46.000
After you and three friends get kidnapped,

29:46.000 --> 29:47.000
Wilson,

29:47.000 --> 29:49.000
you're in trouble and held hostage.

29:49.000 --> 29:52.000
One of the nappers decides to let you go,

29:52.000 --> 29:55.000
but you have to choose which one of your friends get,

29:56.000 --> 29:57.000
um,

29:59.000 --> 30:00.000
by what,

30:00.000 --> 30:01.000
if you don't choose,

30:01.000 --> 30:02.000
both will die.

30:02.000 --> 30:03.000
Oh no,

30:03.000 --> 30:04.000
I'm not doing none of that.

30:05.000 --> 30:06.000
I'm not doing that.

30:06.000 --> 30:08.000
You do not put your friends to death.

30:08.000 --> 30:09.000
That's crazy.

30:10.000 --> 30:11.000
That's crazy.

30:11.000 --> 30:12.000
I'm not even,

30:12.000 --> 30:14.000
I'm not even participating in this.

30:15.000 --> 30:16.000
Um,

30:17.000 --> 30:19.000
if it results in death,

30:20.000 --> 30:21.000
I'm,

30:21.000 --> 30:22.000
I'm not touching it.

30:22.000 --> 30:23.000
That's,

30:23.000 --> 30:24.000
will they both die?

30:24.000 --> 30:25.000
Wait,

30:25.000 --> 30:26.000
if I click the button,

30:26.000 --> 30:27.000
they both die?

30:27.000 --> 30:28.000
No.

30:28.000 --> 30:29.000
Yeah.

30:29.000 --> 30:30.000
So I did that right.

30:30.000 --> 30:32.000
Surely I did that right.

30:33.000 --> 30:34.000
Uh,

30:34.000 --> 30:35.000
hopefully I did that right.

30:35.000 --> 30:36.000
I don't know.

30:36.000 --> 30:37.000
Right, hold on.

30:37.000 --> 30:38.000
How'd you say?

30:38.000 --> 30:39.000
Shawnee killed everyone.

30:40.000 --> 30:41.000
Honestly.

30:41.000 --> 30:42.000
Jokes on you,

30:42.000 --> 30:43.000
I only have,

30:43.000 --> 30:44.000
I don't have two friends.

30:44.000 --> 30:45.000
Wait,

30:45.000 --> 30:46.000
if you bring one friend,

30:46.000 --> 30:47.000
do you beat the system?

30:47.000 --> 30:48.000
You both get away,

30:48.000 --> 30:49.000
scot-free.

30:50.000 --> 30:51.000
That was worded awfully.

30:51.000 --> 30:52.000
Okay.

30:52.000 --> 30:53.000
Thank goodness.

30:53.000 --> 30:54.000
Cause I was like,

30:54.000 --> 30:55.000
damn,

30:55.000 --> 30:56.000
I have not woken up yet.

30:56.000 --> 30:57.000
Right.

30:57.000 --> 30:59.000
You will receive a lifetime supply of meals

30:59.000 --> 31:01.000
from your favorite restaurant,

31:01.000 --> 31:03.000
but you will lose the sense

31:03.000 --> 31:04.000
of taste and smell.

31:04.000 --> 31:07.000
That defeats the entire

31:07.000 --> 31:09.000
purpose of enjoying meals

31:09.000 --> 31:11.000
from your favorite restaurant.

31:11.000 --> 31:12.000
Hi,

31:12.000 --> 31:13.000
from the dead,

31:13.000 --> 31:14.000
can you use that

31:14.000 --> 31:15.000
bring back a dead person button

31:15.000 --> 31:17.000
for the next one?

31:17.000 --> 31:18.000
Thank you.

31:18.000 --> 31:19.000
Sorry,

31:19.000 --> 31:20.000
son.

31:20.000 --> 31:21.000
But you would lose

31:21.000 --> 31:23.000
your sense of taste and smell.

31:23.000 --> 31:25.000
This is redundant.

31:27.000 --> 31:28.000
That's not an option.

31:28.000 --> 31:29.000
That's redundant.

31:29.000 --> 31:30.000
You have negated the effects

31:30.000 --> 31:32.000
of even pressing the damn thing.

31:32.000 --> 31:34.000
No point in pressing it.

31:34.000 --> 31:36.000
I'll just pay for the meals myself.

31:37.000 --> 31:38.000
Okay,

31:38.000 --> 31:39.000
I'll just work extra hard

31:39.000 --> 31:40.000
so I can feed myself.

31:40.000 --> 31:41.000
God damn.

31:41.000 --> 31:42.000
That,

31:42.000 --> 31:44.000
what if they're very nutritious meals?

31:44.000 --> 31:45.000
I mean,

31:45.000 --> 31:46.000
no longer having to pay for food

31:46.000 --> 31:47.000
sounds like a dub.

31:47.000 --> 31:48.000
Honestly,

31:48.000 --> 31:49.000
true.

31:49.000 --> 31:50.000
Texture and,

31:50.000 --> 31:51.000
I mean,

31:51.000 --> 31:52.000
I didn't even put my tongue

31:52.000 --> 31:53.000
on a lasagna

31:53.000 --> 31:54.000
in between the milty cheese

31:54.000 --> 31:55.000
and be like,

31:55.000 --> 31:56.000
yeah,

31:56.000 --> 31:57.000
that satisfies me.

31:57.000 --> 31:58.000
No,

31:58.000 --> 31:59.000
that satisfies me is the taste

31:59.000 --> 32:00.000
and combination

32:00.000 --> 32:01.000
of swallowing.

32:01.000 --> 32:02.000
Okay.

32:02.000 --> 32:03.000
My,

32:03.000 --> 32:04.000
my tongue might be

32:04.000 --> 32:05.000
an exploratory sense,

32:05.000 --> 32:06.000
but like,

32:06.000 --> 32:07.000
I need something

32:07.000 --> 32:08.000
to work off of

32:08.000 --> 32:09.000
when it comes to food.

32:11.000 --> 32:12.000
Right.

32:12.000 --> 32:13.000
All new born children

32:13.000 --> 32:14.000
from here on

32:14.000 --> 32:15.000
will be born

32:15.000 --> 32:16.000
perfect

32:16.000 --> 32:17.000
with immunity

32:17.000 --> 32:18.000
to all diseases

32:18.000 --> 32:20.000
incredibly intellect,

32:20.000 --> 32:21.000
incredible intellect

32:21.000 --> 32:23.000
and good locks.

32:23.000 --> 32:24.000
But

32:24.000 --> 32:25.000
all single people

32:25.000 --> 32:26.000
over the age of 30

32:26.000 --> 32:27.000
will die

32:27.000 --> 32:28.000
instantaneously.

32:28.000 --> 32:29.000
No.

32:29.000 --> 32:30.000
Relax.

32:30.000 --> 32:31.000
It's,

32:31.000 --> 32:32.000
it's okay to have

32:32.000 --> 32:33.000
natural selection.

32:33.000 --> 32:34.000
Look,

32:34.000 --> 32:35.000
I'm sorry.

32:35.000 --> 32:36.000
I said it.

32:36.000 --> 32:37.000
It's okay to have

32:37.000 --> 32:38.000
natural selection

32:38.000 --> 32:39.000
within the populace.

32:39.000 --> 32:41.000
It's perfectly normal.

32:41.000 --> 32:43.000
It comes with nature.

32:43.000 --> 32:44.000
Like,

32:44.000 --> 32:45.000
I mean,

32:45.000 --> 32:46.000
relax.

32:46.000 --> 32:47.000
Why is it 30?

32:47.000 --> 32:48.000
They decided the wall.

32:48.000 --> 32:49.000
They literally said,

32:49.000 --> 32:50.000
hags out.

32:50.000 --> 32:51.000
They said,

32:51.000 --> 32:53.000
lollipops in hags out.

32:53.000 --> 32:54.000
No,

32:54.000 --> 32:55.000
I'm not pressing the button.

32:55.000 --> 32:56.000
Relax.

32:57.000 --> 32:58.000
The eugenics button.

32:58.000 --> 32:59.000
Stop.

33:00.000 --> 33:01.000
That's crazy.

33:01.000 --> 33:02.000
I'm 29.

33:02.000 --> 33:03.000
So press it.

33:03.000 --> 33:04.000
Hag.

33:04.000 --> 33:05.000
Literally,

33:05.000 --> 33:06.000
they said hags out.

33:06.000 --> 33:07.000
Relax.

33:07.000 --> 33:08.000
Lollipops in.

33:08.000 --> 33:09.000
Okay.

33:09.000 --> 33:10.000
Everyone's in.

33:10.000 --> 33:11.000
Fine.

33:11.000 --> 33:12.000
That was a bizarre button.

33:12.000 --> 33:13.000
Some of these are getting

33:13.000 --> 33:14.000
rather,

33:14.000 --> 33:15.000
rather crazy.

33:15.000 --> 33:16.000
No hags.

33:16.000 --> 33:17.000
Hag discrimination.

33:18.000 --> 33:19.000
Me dead.

33:19.000 --> 33:20.000
Hollow life would not

33:20.000 --> 33:21.000
survive such a loss

33:21.000 --> 33:22.000
to their audience.

33:22.000 --> 33:23.000
Wait,

33:23.000 --> 33:24.000
is hollow life full

33:24.000 --> 33:25.000
of hags?

33:26.000 --> 33:27.000
No way.

33:28.000 --> 33:29.000
I don't even think

33:29.000 --> 33:30.000
we have one hag.

33:32.000 --> 33:33.000
I don't think

33:33.000 --> 33:34.000
we have one hag.

33:36.000 --> 33:37.000
Are we the youngest

33:37.000 --> 33:38.000
agency?

33:38.000 --> 33:39.000
Wait,

33:39.000 --> 33:40.000
is hollow life full of hags?

33:41.000 --> 33:42.000
No.

33:42.000 --> 33:43.000
A lot of VTuber fans

33:43.000 --> 33:44.000
are third plus two.

33:44.000 --> 33:45.000
The audience.

33:45.000 --> 33:46.000
Oh,

33:46.000 --> 33:47.000
the audience.

33:47.000 --> 33:48.000
Sorry.

33:48.000 --> 33:49.000
I thought they sent the VTuber.

33:49.000 --> 33:50.000
I was like,

33:50.000 --> 33:51.000
oh my God,

33:51.000 --> 33:52.000
are we like a really young agency

33:52.000 --> 33:53.000
compared to the

33:54.000 --> 33:55.000
thingy?

33:57.000 --> 33:58.000
They're all hags

33:58.000 --> 33:59.000
with high voices.

34:00.000 --> 34:01.000
Hag love.

34:01.000 --> 34:02.000
Hag love.

34:02.000 --> 34:03.000
Karuna's 40.

34:04.000 --> 34:05.000
No, she's not.

34:05.000 --> 34:06.000
You're,

34:06.000 --> 34:07.000
you're pulling my leg.

34:07.000 --> 34:08.000
No one's 40

34:08.000 --> 34:09.000
in hollow life.

34:10.000 --> 34:11.000
30 ain't,

34:11.000 --> 34:12.000
no,

34:12.000 --> 34:13.000
that's hag life.

34:13.000 --> 34:14.000
What are people smoking?

34:14.000 --> 34:15.000
You and she be on high?

34:15.000 --> 34:16.000
No,

34:16.000 --> 34:17.000
well,

34:17.000 --> 34:18.000
you think I'm 30?

34:18.000 --> 34:19.000
I'm not over 30.

34:19.000 --> 34:21.000
I'm not being funny.

34:21.000 --> 34:23.000
I act like I'm over 30.

34:24.000 --> 34:26.000
You think I'm a hag?

34:27.000 --> 34:29.000
Me more she be?

34:29.000 --> 34:31.000
I don't think any of us are hags.

34:31.000 --> 34:32.000
Kenda.

34:32.000 --> 34:33.000
Oh my God.

34:33.000 --> 34:34.000
Danny,

34:34.000 --> 34:36.000
I'm over there.

34:36.000 --> 34:38.000
You think I'm over there?

34:38.000 --> 34:40.000
Can't wait until you're a gilf.

34:40.000 --> 34:41.000
I literally,

34:41.000 --> 34:43.000
a gilf gliss go granny.

34:43.000 --> 34:44.000
That alliteration though.

34:44.000 --> 34:45.000
You're done.

34:45.000 --> 34:46.000
A bit.

34:46.000 --> 34:47.000
Oh my God.

34:48.000 --> 34:49.000
A 20-something year old

34:49.000 --> 34:52.000
with five kid does sound a bit crazy though.

34:52.000 --> 34:53.000
Okay.

34:53.000 --> 34:54.000
Thank you.

34:54.000 --> 34:55.000
It's over for that refling.

34:55.000 --> 34:56.000
Mauds,

34:56.000 --> 34:57.000
give that refling a backshot.

34:57.000 --> 34:58.000
Old lady's 20.

34:58.000 --> 34:59.000
At minimum,

34:59.000 --> 35:00.000
you're older than me.

35:00.000 --> 35:01.000
Hmm.

35:03.000 --> 35:06.000
A bet face connect is the youngest average talent,

35:06.000 --> 35:07.000
to be honest.

35:07.000 --> 35:08.000
Hmm.

35:08.000 --> 35:09.000
What's wrong with being over 30?

35:09.000 --> 35:10.000
Absolutely nothing,

35:10.000 --> 35:13.000
but I don't think I act like I'm,

35:13.000 --> 35:15.000
I feel like 30 is when you mature.

35:15.000 --> 35:17.000
I'm not over 30.

35:18.000 --> 35:20.000
Wasn't 25 hack?

35:20.000 --> 35:23.000
Or expired Xmas cake?

35:23.000 --> 35:24.000
What?

35:24.000 --> 35:26.000
It's just new terminal,

35:26.000 --> 35:28.000
expired Christmas cake.

35:28.000 --> 35:30.000
Who is walking around

35:30.000 --> 35:33.000
calling VTubers expired Christmas cakes?

35:33.000 --> 35:34.000
You need to come back

35:34.000 --> 35:36.000
and explain yourself for that comment right now.

35:36.000 --> 35:39.000
What does that even mean?

35:40.000 --> 35:42.000
A Christmas cake?

35:42.000 --> 35:43.000
Oh,

35:43.000 --> 35:44.000
that,

35:44.000 --> 35:46.000
it's a common term.

35:47.000 --> 35:50.000
Matureing is for vegetables.

35:50.000 --> 35:52.000
You have to,

35:52.000 --> 35:54.000
oh my God.

35:54.000 --> 35:55.000
Hag older than me,

35:55.000 --> 35:57.000
therefore the age goes up every year.

35:57.000 --> 35:58.000
Okay, that's funny.

35:58.000 --> 36:01.000
Wait, Christmas cake is a term?

36:01.000 --> 36:02.000
No,

36:02.000 --> 36:04.000
that's hilarious.

36:04.000 --> 36:05.000
I've not heard of that.

36:05.000 --> 36:07.000
You might as well just start calling people prunes

36:07.000 --> 36:08.000
while you're at it.

36:08.000 --> 36:10.000
Oh, you're a wrinkly old prune.

36:10.000 --> 36:11.000
What age is that?

36:11.000 --> 36:12.000
Oh, oh, it's 20.

36:12.000 --> 36:13.000
What?

36:13.000 --> 36:14.000
Like,

36:15.000 --> 36:18.000
that is hilarious.

36:18.000 --> 36:20.000
A Christmas cake is a Japanese term

36:20.000 --> 36:22.000
for a woman past her prime.

36:22.000 --> 36:23.000
That's shocking.

36:23.000 --> 36:24.000
That's,

36:24.000 --> 36:25.000
that's,

36:25.000 --> 36:27.000
fermented VTuber agency.

36:27.000 --> 36:29.000
That is hilarious.

36:29.000 --> 36:30.000
I am closing down VLR

36:30.000 --> 36:32.000
to open that up right now.

36:32.000 --> 36:34.000
It's just dedicated to hags only.

36:34.000 --> 36:36.000
Imagine getting called a reason.

36:36.000 --> 36:37.000
Honestly,

36:37.000 --> 36:39.000
Shawnee is the least wee VTuber

36:39.000 --> 36:40.000
I've ever seen.

36:40.000 --> 36:41.000
True.

36:41.000 --> 36:43.000
I'm a gamer over a weeb.

36:44.000 --> 36:46.000
Does that mean I'm shunned?

36:46.000 --> 36:47.000
Am I shunned?

36:49.000 --> 36:51.000
But I do want to watch enemies with you.

36:51.000 --> 36:52.000
Actually, that's a side note.

36:52.000 --> 36:54.000
I do want to watch enemies with you guys.

36:54.000 --> 36:55.000
So,

36:55.000 --> 36:57.000
there'll be a wave three confirmed.

36:57.000 --> 36:59.000
Gen three full of hags.

36:59.000 --> 37:01.000
I mean,

37:01.000 --> 37:03.000
well, it can't be gen two

37:03.000 --> 37:05.000
unless you want a hag and a lollipop

37:05.000 --> 37:08.000
because there's two lollipops.

37:10.000 --> 37:11.000
VLR lasts long enough

37:11.000 --> 37:13.000
it'll become a hardcore.

37:13.000 --> 37:14.000
Honestly,

37:14.000 --> 37:15.000
I mean,

37:15.000 --> 37:17.000
if you guys didn't know,

37:17.000 --> 37:19.000
the girls will renew their contract

37:19.000 --> 37:21.000
in May 2025

37:21.000 --> 37:23.000
and as an incentive

37:23.000 --> 37:24.000
to stay on,

37:24.000 --> 37:27.000
the split goes to 85.15

37:27.000 --> 37:30.000
and we also purchase them

37:30.000 --> 37:32.000
an alternative outfit

37:32.000 --> 37:34.000
they can ask for what they want

37:34.000 --> 37:37.000
and we'll pay the costs for it.

37:37.000 --> 37:38.000
So yeah,

37:38.000 --> 37:39.000
if you watch JoJo's,

37:39.000 --> 37:41.000
I'll stop by watching right now.

37:41.000 --> 37:42.000
Oh, isn't JoJo's long?

37:42.000 --> 37:43.000
I mean,

37:43.000 --> 37:45.000
I'm talking like 12-episode stuff.

37:45.000 --> 37:46.000
I mean,

37:46.000 --> 37:47.000
we can even watch a bit of Bentay

37:47.000 --> 37:48.000
if you want.

37:48.000 --> 37:49.000
Like, calm down.

37:52.000 --> 37:53.000
Yes.

37:53.000 --> 37:54.000
Lollibaba gen,

37:54.000 --> 37:55.000
just all of them.

37:55.000 --> 37:56.000
It depends.

37:56.000 --> 37:57.000
It has various seasons.

37:57.000 --> 37:58.000
If you think about it,

37:58.000 --> 38:01.000
Hale is around for like seven years.

38:01.000 --> 38:08.000
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

38:08.000 --> 38:10.000
Is it that halo you were talking about?

38:12.000 --> 38:14.000
Is my dress up darling possible?

38:15.000 --> 38:16.000
Is it long?

38:17.000 --> 38:18.000
12?

38:18.000 --> 38:19.000
Yeah, like I'm talking like

38:19.000 --> 38:20.000
we sit down for the day

38:20.000 --> 38:22.000
and watch a 12-episode anime together.

38:22.000 --> 38:24.000
That's what I want to do.

38:24.000 --> 38:26.000
They said holo, not halo.

38:26.000 --> 38:27.000
Oh, sorry!

38:27.000 --> 38:28.000
Sorry.

38:28.000 --> 38:29.000
I wasn't kidding when I said

38:29.000 --> 38:30.000
I was a gamer.

38:30.000 --> 38:37.960
I said it was a gamer, okay? I read Halo. I thought you were talking about Halo, the

38:37.960 --> 38:47.480
hit video game, okay? Master Chief from Fortnite. Sorry. Sorry. Based in gamer build, honestly.

38:47.480 --> 38:54.720
Right. You can get a ton of candy that you love. You'll never be able to read a book.

38:54.720 --> 38:59.080
Oh no, I'm in a reading book. Sorry. I'm in a reading book. I've been enjoying reading

38:59.080 --> 39:04.840
a few books. I will abstain from this button. I've been enjoying a good book. And I've

39:04.840 --> 39:08.880
still not even read Lord of the Rings with you yet. Reading isn't for Mummy today and

39:08.880 --> 39:12.680
this entire stream is about reading so it's not going well. I don't know what to replace

39:12.680 --> 39:20.200
tomorrow's stream with yet. I don't know if I'll bring up the honey. I don't know if

39:20.200 --> 39:24.640
you guys saw the schedule. I'm playing Honeycam Studios. That game used to have everyone in

39:24.640 --> 39:29.320
a freaking grip. Ooh, we're going to do reading stream. Well, this is technically reading,

39:29.320 --> 39:36.520
is it not? I'm reading chat and I'm reading, will you press the button? You want the bent

39:36.520 --> 39:40.880
high stream tomorrow? Hmm. Wait, you said Lord of the Rings would be when you graduate.

39:40.880 --> 39:46.680
Oh, did I? For the book? Okay, we're not reading Lord of the Rings anytime soon then. I still,

39:46.680 --> 39:51.240
put me back in the ring, Chief. I still got it. I still got it, okay? I got that doll.

39:52.120 --> 39:58.840
Let me back in the ring. Bunny Garden. It's no for me. It's no for me. I'll have a hunt

39:58.840 --> 40:04.720
around and see if I can find a few shorter games. I just stopped being sad when I watched

40:04.720 --> 40:12.600
Johnny. No pass on this. Okay, you can make all the world feel happy, but you become sad.

40:12.600 --> 40:21.880
I become sad. Um, I don't think I can stream very well if I'm in a bad mood. A cheese, oh,

40:21.880 --> 40:30.320
a chess blitz stream when? Um, there's a solid one here, you like that? What remains of Edith

40:30.320 --> 40:35.600
Flint? I'm playing that in three weeks. I wrote that down because someone recommended it and

40:35.600 --> 40:41.440
it was short. Already depressed, I'll push the button. Oh, I'll be fine. Nothing changes for

40:41.440 --> 40:46.120
me, but the world gets better. Why not? Oh, no, I'm not that sad. I'm quite, I'm always quite

40:46.120 --> 40:51.720
neutral or happy. I don't think it, wait, I don't, can I make you as happy if I'm depressed?

40:51.720 --> 41:00.360
I don't know. I feel like I can't do it because if I'm depressed, I can't even stream. An actual

41:00.360 --> 41:04.160
dilemma for once. This is probably the first one that I've actually had a dilemma with.

41:04.160 --> 41:10.320
Have you played Sucker for Love? I have not. I can't be sad when watching you pass. Press the

41:10.320 --> 41:14.520
button. I'm already at that stage. If Stroni was sad, I would be sad. Yeah, literally, I'd be

41:14.520 --> 41:20.240
greeting over anything and making you guys upset. So no. Oh, wow, I'm in the minority. This is the

41:20.240 --> 41:28.800
first question I've been in the minority. Wow. Oh, no, I couldn't be sad. I feel like I'd wrought

41:28.800 --> 41:36.320
away, I'd waste away. Oh, no, that's the first one I failed where I don't, I'm not with the

41:36.320 --> 41:43.600
majority. Oh, wait, what did I just do? Oops. Oh, sorry. I thought I was on the same one. I'm so

41:43.600 --> 41:47.800
sorry. I thought I was on the same one. What did I say no to? Half Life 3 comes out, but you never

41:47.800 --> 41:54.320
get to play it. And I said, no. Oops. Okay, let's actually do it. Sorry. The Byzantine

41:54.320 --> 42:10.360
Empire is revived. What? What kind of question is that? What kind of question is this? Oh, my

42:10.360 --> 42:18.080
god. I thought this is like a funny thing. Yeah. Oh, this is bizarre. How did that even get in?

42:19.040 --> 42:31.600
Did they not review the submitted questions? What the fuck? That's bizarre. That's bizarre. We're

42:31.600 --> 42:38.800
skipping, we're skipping this. We're not, this isn't a submission or anything of anything. What the

42:38.800 --> 42:45.040
fuck? What the fuck? We're skipping. We're not even looking at the results. Okay. That was bizarre.

42:45.040 --> 42:50.800
Anyway, unlimited supply of your favorite cereal for the rest of your life, but you can't have any

42:50.800 --> 43:00.160
milk with it. This, people love submitting things that negate the benefit of the first one. Like,

43:00.160 --> 43:04.720
here's the benefit. Oh, by the way, we're gonna negate it. Okay, so there's pointless then. There's

43:04.720 --> 43:13.200
no point to it. Like, I'm lactose intolerant. Anyway, let's go. Press. I don't even use milk.

43:13.280 --> 43:20.240
Water and cereal, it is. Don't ever speak for the rest of the stream. Don't make me ever think

43:20.240 --> 43:28.720
about watery Cheerios. I don't want to think about watery Cheerios, okay? Okay, you're allowed to

43:28.720 --> 43:36.000
speak, but don't do that again. Okay. Juice and cereal. What kind of juice? How do you put juice

43:36.000 --> 43:42.080
in Cheerios? Substitute with yogurt. Time out that reflint. Never cook again.

43:43.360 --> 43:48.560
Wait, we can give it to the people who need it. Oh, if it's boxed up, then sure, I'd donate that

43:48.560 --> 43:55.440
stuff. I don't eat cereal anyway. Yeah, that's fine. We'll box it up and we'll give it to food

43:55.440 --> 44:01.440
banks. I have no problem with that. I'm not fussed for cereal. It's just like sugary thingy anyway.

44:01.440 --> 44:09.600
Wait, hold up. Is Cheerios your favorite? I like Honey Cheerios. I like Frosted Shreddies,

44:09.600 --> 44:16.640
and I like Crunchy Knot. It's called Crunchy Knot in the UK. Stop laughing. Stop it Americans.

44:16.640 --> 44:20.960
I know you're laughing right now. It's called Crunchy Knot. It's the name of the cereal.

44:21.760 --> 44:28.320
It's not your sock, okay? It's not your crusty sock. It's called Crunchy Knot. It is. It's what

44:28.320 --> 44:39.440
the cereal's called. Stop. That nut, oh man. Base, I love those Crunchy Knot. Laugh at her. No,

44:39.440 --> 44:46.480
it's what it's called. My nuts a bit more chewy, sadly. You're right. It's our Crunchy Socks. I

44:46.480 --> 44:54.000
was going to make the most disgusting ASMR. Someone tweeted something hilarious, and it was like a

44:54.880 --> 45:02.240
crunchy sock, and I was like, I really want to make an ASMR of me munching, and it's like girlfriend

45:02.240 --> 45:08.160
munches on your crusty sock ASMR at the bottom of your bed while you sleep or something like that,

45:08.160 --> 45:12.000
and it's absolutely disgusting. Actually, I'm going to write that down before I forget. Write that down.

45:12.000 --> 45:25.680
Write that down. Girlfriend munches on your crusty sock ASMR, and it's just me like, that's delicious,

45:25.680 --> 45:30.880
and all of that, and I'm munching away. That's disgusting. No way, that's foul, but it's so funny.

45:30.880 --> 45:37.120
It is foul. That's why I want to make it. Okay, you've become the funniest person on the planet.

45:38.080 --> 45:43.360
You can only talk in jokes, and they're always Chuck Norris jokes. Again with the negation.

45:45.280 --> 45:51.680
I'm going to need you to come up with abstract concepts that these two don't relate, but they're

45:51.680 --> 46:02.560
on a level, whether that be philosophical, physical, some sort of same level. But Chuck Norris jokes

46:02.560 --> 46:07.200
are funny. I can't even remember. Can we just go back to unbirth? You know what, you're done.

46:08.480 --> 46:12.560
Are you saying Chuck Norris isn't funny? What's the Chuck Norris thing? I can't remember.

46:15.840 --> 46:20.480
I've literally forgotten the Chuck Norris memes. Stroni's already the funniest person on the planet.

46:20.480 --> 46:23.360
You stop that, you give me an ego. We all know women can't be funny.

46:25.760 --> 46:31.120
I'm accidentally humorous. That's why I am. That's by accident. Does that make you the only person

46:31.120 --> 46:34.400
on the planet? Chuck Norris jokes are really not. Chuck Norris doesn't eat honey. He chews bees.

46:34.400 --> 46:42.080
Ah, right. Okay, I remember. I remember. I remember. I remember. Get on with the funniest.

46:42.080 --> 46:50.160
The sin of greed is not here. Again, I'm going to say no. I don't know. I will not press. You

46:50.160 --> 46:56.240
cannot tempt me, devil. But yeah. Oh, wow. Okay, majority vote there. Only 19%. We're like, yeah,

46:56.320 --> 47:05.760
that's good. Okay, you become completely immortal. I don't like that. If humanity hasn't made it to

47:05.760 --> 47:10.640
interstellar travel and sun has gone supernova, you will drift in space alone still. No,

47:11.360 --> 47:16.480
absolutely not. See, the reason why I like vampires is because you know, if you've ever had enough,

47:16.480 --> 47:20.880
you can just go to someone, go and do as a favor pal. See this bit of wood, go and just hammer it

47:20.880 --> 47:27.440
through my chest. That'd be great pal. Just stay up, right? But this version, absolutely not. It's

47:27.440 --> 47:36.080
the most horrific thing I have ever seen. Like vampire, you take it, you're crazy. Just jumping

47:36.080 --> 47:42.800
to a black hole. A bit of cheeky spaghettification to solve the problem. Why not? Being stuck in

47:42.800 --> 47:50.240
space doesn't sound so bad. There's no internet in space. Who wants to become immortal? Are you crazy?

47:51.600 --> 47:57.920
Understand all truth of the universe but can never talk to others again. Well, good thing,

47:57.920 --> 48:04.080
I know sign language. Boom. And I can write stuff down on paper. Boom. Press that,

48:04.080 --> 48:10.960
motherfucker. Oh wait, how am I supposed to livestream? Would you guys still watch me if

48:10.960 --> 48:16.320
the way I communicated was by doing, like, I like to do sign language and write stuff down?

48:17.040 --> 48:23.440
Can I still make noises? It says talk. If I can still make noises, all you're gonna hear is like

48:24.880 --> 48:33.680
just use a talk text to speech stream, morse code stream. I have no idea what I've just said

48:33.680 --> 48:41.360
if I actually said anything. If TTS has a Scottish accent, I mean, I wouldn't understand you one bit

48:41.360 --> 48:47.520
but sure. But imagine all of the conspiracy theories I can tell you about. Come on, that's like

48:47.520 --> 48:57.200
unlimited content. Wait, how would we get ASMR? It would just be non-talking ASMR. So congrats to

48:57.200 --> 49:02.560
the people that don't like talking ASMR. I got you covered. You press the button but the button

49:02.560 --> 49:09.040
doesn't work. Go for it then. Wait, why did no one press that? She chose knowledge over us. No,

49:09.040 --> 49:18.880
I'll give you the details, okay? Eh, no talking ASMR. I don't like it. You gain the power to stop

49:18.880 --> 49:27.840
time as long as you want and as often as you want but while time has stopped, you age normally

49:27.840 --> 49:33.360
and each time you restart, you age, bruv, again with the negation.

49:37.760 --> 49:45.920
I mean, I guess it's optional. I can't imagine I'm up to anything but to skip six months of health

49:45.920 --> 49:54.640
is insane though. You guys are saying easy press? You gain the power to stop time as long as you want.

49:55.440 --> 49:59.840
What would I need to do with that? I mean, I guess if I had just all lined up at convention,

50:01.760 --> 50:08.880
it'd be worth it. Nah, I don't think I like that. I guess if it's optional to have it as a back

50:08.880 --> 50:14.000
pocket ability, like say you wear, I think someone said car crash there. Yeah, say if you knew you

50:14.000 --> 50:20.960
were about to be in a car crash. Mugging the car crash? Okay. I'm pressing it because it's an optional

50:20.960 --> 50:28.560
ability. You don't have to activate it but it could be life or death. So I'm actually not too

50:28.560 --> 50:38.560
raging at it. You can ink with any women you want just by pointing at them and asking but you must

50:38.560 --> 50:44.960
watch the notebook each time. This is just an OG, son. What's going on here? You guys, I'm pretty

50:44.960 --> 50:56.080
sure that Snowberries just watched the notebook with icicle. Can we change this to a reflin instead?

50:56.800 --> 51:01.120
You can have... Oh, I said the word sorry, I did. I just slapped my mouth there. If you heard that,

51:01.120 --> 51:06.480
you can have... You can ink. Hey, Strani, never made me pointing at you but I need to ask you

51:06.480 --> 51:13.120
something. We can already do this. Don't need to do that one more minute. That's all good. I

51:13.120 --> 51:20.320
literally just smacked my mouth there. Right, let's just pretend this says refling. Thank you. I'll

51:20.320 --> 51:29.760
take it. Thank you very much. Yeah, 60% said I. Well, Strani doesn't want to ink with me. No, because

51:29.760 --> 51:40.480
it specifies every time you ink. Yeah, but with a partner. I mean, that could be the aftercare.

51:40.480 --> 51:45.040
Oh, let's slap on the notebook. How long's the notebook? I've never seen it. I don't know what

51:45.040 --> 51:49.680
it's about, to be honest. Apparently, refling's your in it. You're featured in it.

51:52.800 --> 51:56.640
Strani, you just need to ask. I'd cry every time. It's too long. It's two hours.

51:58.720 --> 52:03.840
It would be wild if the movie just flashed in your head during... Google says it's two hours and 10

52:03.840 --> 52:10.240
minutes. Oh, that's quite a lot. Can't be aftercare. You need to watch before. But someone said it

52:10.240 --> 52:18.080
makes you cry. You have an unlimited amount of cash, power, and good looks. But Justin Bieber is

52:18.080 --> 52:24.240
your roommate for the rest of your life. He acts like a massive douchebag. Is this... How old is

52:24.240 --> 52:31.920
this website? Is this like an old-ass question? Do you remember the hate that Justin Bieber used to

52:31.920 --> 52:41.760
get? Oh my god. Mail on stream. Literally not having that. Like, I feel like... Right, this is just

52:41.760 --> 52:49.520
me. I feel like if you never work towards something, like, you never get that satisfaction of trying

52:49.520 --> 52:55.760
hard and getting it to pay off. Like, if it's just handed to you, so is but. This is just me. If it's

52:55.760 --> 53:00.720
just handed to you, you've got nothing to work towards. Like, now don't get me wrong. Capitalism,

53:00.720 --> 53:07.040
bad and all that. But if you had unlimited money, what experiences do you get other than making

53:07.040 --> 53:14.400
poor people miserable and, like, squandering over, like, falling out your feet to try and get a tip

53:14.400 --> 53:22.960
from you type thing? Like, is that what gives, you know, billionaire? I would literally... You know,

53:22.960 --> 53:29.200
actually, if I had unlimited money, I think I'd bring back the arts. I want architecture. I want

53:29.200 --> 53:35.760
sandstone architecture back in. I want rid of this new age buildings. I want historical, beautiful

53:35.760 --> 53:42.160
features. I want the arts back. Have you seen the churches made in the 15th century? Stunning,

53:42.160 --> 53:50.880
beautiful, still standing. And then churches today are, like, ugly. I'm here for the culture. When we

53:50.880 --> 53:58.480
play Civilian Civilization 5, I'm here for the culture, okay? I want culture. I like culture,

53:58.480 --> 54:04.320
okay? Done with modern architecture, exactly. Using limited money to lobby every Congress,

54:04.880 --> 54:10.080
parliament on earth to do your bidding. Now you're talking, like, a real refling. I like that, I like

54:10.080 --> 54:20.400
that. Holy Bacus, bring back past architecture. Cultural victory, reject modern return to Ziggurats.

54:20.960 --> 54:26.720
Cultural victory. No way to get rid of him means you can kill him. You can kill him?

54:28.480 --> 54:34.960
Actually, yeah, he doesn't have to be alive. And if I have unlimited power, I mean, no one's gonna

54:34.960 --> 54:41.520
find out. He acts like a mess and... Oh, there's no way to get rid of him. Oh, no, sorry. It's not worth it.

54:42.960 --> 54:48.880
It's not worth it, okay? You can choose to save the life of any loved one or friend at will,

54:48.880 --> 54:59.120
but they will no longer remember who you are. I don't... I'm not one for meddling with nature. I

54:59.120 --> 55:08.000
find it quite rather... I think when you're, you know, I don't believe in, like, fate or, like,

55:08.000 --> 55:14.240
you know, you're destined for this or that. But I'm not a fan of, like, Trump and nature. Like,

55:14.320 --> 55:20.800
I'll let nature do its course, you know? I'd press it for you. Oh, Riefling! What the...

55:20.800 --> 55:24.480
Don't say that. Are you trying to make us cry? It's like first thing in the morning. Are you

55:24.480 --> 55:29.920
trying to make us cry? Oh, my God. I press it to love someone. You sometimes you have to be a stranger.

55:29.920 --> 55:33.680
Well, literally, I don't know if you guys remember Harry Potter where Hermione had to

55:34.400 --> 55:39.920
get her parents to forget or I'm like, oh, my God. I hope she can reverse that.

55:40.880 --> 55:46.400
Um, Spider-Man already did that. I doubt my friends are getting into many life or death,

55:46.400 --> 55:56.400
but I could re-meet them and check they existed. I don't know. Imagine saving a parent. Oh,

55:58.400 --> 56:03.280
it didn't sound... Oh, I don't know if I can even speak on that because I've not lost a parent.

56:04.240 --> 56:07.680
I'd probably feel way different at a later date, but

56:10.320 --> 56:18.560
that route forgetting you as well is like really... It's not... Yeah, I'm not sure. I'm not touching

56:18.560 --> 56:24.400
that. I'm not touching it. Well, yeah, I'm in the minority with that one. That scares me. That

56:24.400 --> 56:35.680
kind of stuff scares me. That one was a hard one. That was not an easy one.

56:36.720 --> 56:40.480
Johnny, I would also press it for you. I would make you happy even if I meant I could never...

56:40.480 --> 56:45.120
You never knew who I was. That's so sad though. Are you trying to make me great? I'll greet

56:45.120 --> 56:48.720
first thing in the morning. Don't think I want. Learn to love yourself and then save yourself,

56:48.720 --> 56:53.600
but they will remember everyone else close to them. That was not easy. I didn't like that. Better

56:53.600 --> 56:58.560
have it than not to have it. No one can say you got to use it. Oh, that's true. Well, I've just

56:58.560 --> 57:10.160
passed on it. Learn to love... Yes. You get to make friends all over again if you press it. That's

57:10.160 --> 57:21.360
true. You get to download as many songs as you want. How old is this question? iPod? You get to...

57:22.240 --> 57:27.840
I have never... That's an ancient relic by today's standards. It's not even a thing anymore.

57:29.840 --> 57:37.520
You get to download as many songs as you want on your iPod. The songs have... Again with Justin...

57:38.560 --> 57:44.160
This is old. We're skipping. This is so old. The age is showing of this question. That's crazy.

57:45.120 --> 57:54.560
I'm literally lying while I go brrrrr. I'd press this. It doesn't say you have to listen to any of it.

57:55.520 --> 58:00.880
You young ones don't even know what an iPod is. Easiest press to get an iPod. It's an iPod

58:00.880 --> 58:08.800
with a headphone jack. I still use an iPod for work. Oh, replaying. Are you an OG son?

58:08.800 --> 58:17.520
All right. We've found the ancient tip. You can see through all holding, but you cannot turn the

58:17.520 --> 58:27.360
power off. Oh, no. That's not for me. I feel like you'd get desensitized very quickly, but that's

58:27.360 --> 58:39.520
not for me. No. Yeah, I'm skipping. Well, 41% said I. No, that's no right. That's no right. You're

58:39.520 --> 58:47.040
getting done for that. That's indecent. I'd press it only if I'm filthy rich. Oh, so you could pick

58:47.040 --> 58:54.240
and choose who's around you. We've got an Asian population, so nah, I'll pass. You have incredible

58:54.240 --> 58:59.200
art skills, but you're unable to share it on the internet for your entire life. That's funny,

58:59.200 --> 59:07.760
because I actually wanted to pick up art when I retire and become a wee artist. I'm going to skip

59:07.760 --> 59:15.440
because you can develop art skills over years. Yes, it takes years, but that's the progress. That's

59:15.440 --> 59:20.720
the journey. It's a part of the journey. It's not about when it comes to Lord of the Rings,

59:20.800 --> 59:26.240
you didn't skip to Mount Doom, did you? And pop the ring in. No. You take the journey. You

59:26.240 --> 59:34.560
watch your progress. You watch your craft evolve. Just have someone else share it. You know what?

59:34.560 --> 59:39.360
See your reef lens and your smart ways of just getting around the rules. That's actually really

59:39.360 --> 59:44.800
smart. Please don't type that again. You're going to start ruining these if you get the lip around.

59:45.200 --> 59:54.320
And that is hilarious. NDA forbids me from sharing art online. You can share art in any other way.

59:54.320 --> 59:59.840
Loop polling it. Honestly, I'll get you guys to loop poll it for me, because I'll take that. I love

59:59.840 --> 01:00:05.760
art. I think it's amazing. Emi drew that one piece of artwork for herself. Well, she's actually

01:00:05.840 --> 01:00:12.080
drawn multiple with it. That one banner-esque one, it was absolutely insane quality. Like insane.

01:00:14.560 --> 01:00:22.400
72% of the people have pressed this button whilst 27% did not. Yeah, literally skirt the rules.

01:00:24.320 --> 01:00:30.480
We create a new internet. We're toppling the system, strongy. Just for me. Stop it. You're making me

01:00:30.480 --> 01:00:36.480
blue. It feels good to see people improve their skills over time. Press equals sell to some random

01:00:36.480 --> 01:00:41.200
private collection. It's easy and rich. Speed runs. Reeflings pull together to make a strongy

01:00:41.200 --> 01:00:50.480
art. Oh, you can be anywhere you want in your room right now. Reefling under your desk. But you have to

01:00:50.480 --> 01:01:03.040
be a pawn. What is- I don't understand how that's even- Oh, do you want to become a horse? It's

01:01:03.040 --> 01:01:07.760
basically asking do you want to become a horse? No, there's not going to be a horse girl for Jen

01:01:07.760 --> 01:01:14.480
too. Stop asking. It doesn't- Like, aw, you just randomly turn into a horse for the rest of your

01:01:14.480 --> 01:01:20.960
life. Bruv. That's not how none of this works. Again, the freaking horses. I can't escape.

01:01:21.680 --> 01:01:27.600
Even pony calls. You're done. Strongy pony. Strongy show horse.

01:01:28.960 --> 01:01:36.560
MLP brunies winning. Any cloffers, honestly. A pony cannot watch streams. This sucks.

01:01:37.360 --> 01:01:43.200
The writer barely disguised- The writer's barely disguised fish. That is hilarious. No, we're not

01:01:43.280 --> 01:01:45.600
becoming a freaking pony. Are you joking? Yeah, let-

01:01:48.400 --> 01:01:52.160
Oh, some people have had enough of the system if they'll happily become a pony.

01:01:54.160 --> 01:02:00.960
What's the downside? Oh, honestly. Instead of a cuttlefish I'm a seahorse. Oh, that's kind of cute.

01:02:02.160 --> 01:02:10.400
Friendship is magic and magic is heresy. There's 32,000 brunies. We're on to them. We've caught them

01:02:10.480 --> 01:02:16.000
in 4K. You understand every human language in existence? That's a good one, but you are a mutant

01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:25.280
can never- Again with the negation! Here is cool thing. Here's negation. Am I like ruining this

01:02:25.280 --> 01:02:32.640
little fun website by pointing out the major flaws of the questions? I'm passing on that. Sorry,

01:02:32.640 --> 01:02:38.880
I need my communication skills. Unless, you know, the only other exception is I get to learn everything

01:02:38.880 --> 01:02:42.720
and then I get to do my tinfoil hat stream with full confidence.

01:02:45.040 --> 01:02:52.640
Yeah, 65% said no, which is right. You make one horrible event in the past cease to exist,

01:02:52.640 --> 01:02:55.440
but you will be responsible for a hor- No, that-

01:02:57.280 --> 01:03:03.840
This is just a circle! Remove one to gain one. You have given us a circle. Give us a better one.

01:03:04.800 --> 01:03:10.320
You have given us a dang circle. Just write or use a TTS absolute dub, honestly.

01:03:11.840 --> 01:03:20.560
Can you choose the event? I don't know. I mean, this makes you an A tier translator,

01:03:20.560 --> 01:03:24.960
but yeah, 90% of superpower with downsides is literally just coolest thing ever, followed by

01:03:24.960 --> 01:03:30.880
wow, this sucks, yeah. If I get to pick the horrible event I'm responsible for,

01:03:31.680 --> 01:03:37.840
I don't know what kind of human event I would be comfortable causing. Can we call it, like,

01:03:37.840 --> 01:03:44.000
the mass inking maybe? And be like, all guys around the world couldn't go to work that day

01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:49.360
because they can't feel their thighs after how hard they just inked, you know? Like,

01:03:49.360 --> 01:03:55.760
something like that? Would that work? Is that fine? I'd be fine causing that, like, catastrophe.

01:03:55.760 --> 01:03:59.360
I'm fine with that. That's fine. I'll take one for the team. I'll make some of the most

01:03:59.360 --> 01:04:06.640
great collapse of capitalism. Steady. We don't have a system yet to swoop in with. You get to

01:04:06.640 --> 01:04:13.040
be a world-famous vtuber, but you're a Scottish cuttlefish. Stop! That's so funny. Not exactly

01:04:13.040 --> 01:04:19.280
world-famous, steady on. Strani, aren't you planning on killing humanity via siren feeding?

01:04:19.280 --> 01:04:26.880
Look, you've caught me in a bit of a pickle, but maybe there was some talk of that. Not at the

01:04:26.880 --> 01:04:32.800
moment, though. Not at the moment. I'm just bing-chinging. Dang it. Bing-chinging. She's gonna

01:04:32.800 --> 01:04:40.960
make us ink. Domain expansion, infinite inkworks, honestly. Strani, I wish to be responsible for

01:04:40.960 --> 01:04:50.080
coming again. Ink again. The Great Brown Noise incident of 54. The day Strani made the entire

01:04:50.080 --> 01:04:59.280
population ink. Eh, right. Yeah, but she's kind of bad at it. Okay, okay. Your ability to listen,

01:04:59.280 --> 01:05:08.560
touch, taste, smell, and conversation are improved. You lose the ability to say,

01:05:08.560 --> 01:05:14.640
nah, I can't be blind, so I need my bowls. I think if I had to pick between losing a sense,

01:05:14.720 --> 01:05:23.760
first is smell. Couldn't... first is smell. Then... so touch is actually a really dangerous one to

01:05:23.760 --> 01:05:28.640
lose because that's how you tell you're injured or whatever, but thankfully I don't do anything that's

01:05:28.640 --> 01:05:36.720
injury-based. You just become the daredevil. I'd lose my sense of pain. Five head, lose your sense

01:05:36.720 --> 01:05:44.560
of temperature because you're... was it... didn't Vsauce? Vsauce was like, oh, I swear God, if my

01:05:44.560 --> 01:05:49.600
dad's about to burst in this room, I can hear him listen. Right, no, we're skipping that one. I'd like

01:05:49.600 --> 01:05:56.560
to keep my eyeballs, please. Right, you can turn into any animal that you've seen with your own eyes,

01:05:56.560 --> 01:06:02.480
not in a photo. Right, so we've become the green guy from Team Titans, I've forgotten his name,

01:06:02.480 --> 01:06:07.360
but you have to die in the animal form to go back. You have to die in the animal form

01:06:08.800 --> 01:06:18.240
to go back. That's so bizarre. That doesn't make sense. If you lose your sense of touch,

01:06:18.240 --> 01:06:23.440
you can't ink. I take it back, I don't want that one. Smell is an easy one to lose, yeah.

01:06:24.400 --> 01:06:30.800
Would I experience the pain? Yeah, like, a zoo? Beast... oh, Beast Boy's name, okay, that makes sense.

01:06:32.160 --> 01:06:38.480
Um, bunch of the electric cables, honestly, that's pretty... I wonder how easy it would be

01:06:38.480 --> 01:06:43.360
to pop your clogs if you're an animal. Being like, hmm, I will walk in front of this car now. No,

01:06:43.360 --> 01:06:51.600
I'm skipping this. I'm skipping, I don't like it, I'm scared. Oh wow, we're in the minority, oh my.

01:06:53.520 --> 01:06:58.000
You have the fastest internet for free, you can play any game online for free and never

01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:05.200
have to pay for membership. So literally VTuber, but ultimate VTuber, but you must watch a minimum of

01:07:08.560 --> 01:07:19.040
this age terribly. This is such an old, oh no. If I had to waste three hours a day on anything,

01:07:19.040 --> 01:07:24.240
I don't have enough time to stream. That's not a benefit, okay? It's, I'm already doing it. Someone

01:07:24.240 --> 01:07:31.840
says, oh okay dude, okay dude, no downside. That is far too much time commitment, literally three

01:07:31.840 --> 01:07:40.560
hours is insane. I'm stretching, I already do it. Okay, yous are all done. I would watch

01:07:41.600 --> 01:07:48.480
all the popcorn, Elizabeth's popcorn. I'd press it plus, I can just send it to my friends as a joke.

01:07:48.480 --> 01:08:00.160
Does ASMR count? Is there, is there Lebanese ASMR of like two chicks together? I didn't even know

01:08:00.160 --> 01:08:10.400
that was a thing. Oh girls, are you ready for off collab? That's awful, we're skipping that one.

01:08:10.400 --> 01:08:15.600
I do not have three hours a day. I, I need to give everything to the refunds, okay?

01:08:15.600 --> 01:08:22.080
Lebanese, yes. The clam, slammy, smart. There's definitely female for female ASMR.

01:08:22.960 --> 01:08:31.040
And then everything exists. I don't think I've ever looked up. Hmm, it's sad people don't have time

01:08:31.040 --> 01:08:38.160
for popcorn anymore. That's terrible. You can temporarily take over the body of any person

01:08:38.880 --> 01:08:42.720
on earth, and you can turn back into yourself whenever, but they die, oh,

01:08:44.240 --> 01:08:52.000
Merve, Merve. Okay, hold on. If I want to become an assassin to take down,

01:08:55.600 --> 01:08:59.280
you can temporarily take over the body and turn back, but they die.

01:09:01.440 --> 01:09:07.600
They die after you leave their body. So I'm a walking death note. Yeah, I'll do it. I'm down with

01:09:08.320 --> 01:09:14.080
stop and refling the high table down with the high table reeflings. Yes. Yes.

01:09:15.120 --> 01:09:22.880
End me pl- No! End me PLS. Reefling, Brian. KFP Spidey. Thank you for the five. No.

01:09:26.640 --> 01:09:31.360
We're not doing that. Ain't that basically what siren does anyway? True. So it's not really

01:09:31.360 --> 01:09:37.520
anything too particularly new concept wise. Strone's body hopping across the world

01:09:37.520 --> 01:09:43.440
and fast tracking her goal of ending the world, honestly. You can foresee the future

01:09:43.440 --> 01:09:48.720
reeflings. I predict an inking for you. Yes, yes. Did I guess right? Are you inking?

01:09:50.080 --> 01:09:58.160
Okay, soon you will ink within the next week. You cannot prevent anything that will occur.

01:09:58.160 --> 01:10:04.480
I think having foresight would be good. I get the- Wait, no, you can't prevent it.

01:10:04.880 --> 01:10:10.080
Are you serious? Are you serious? So you can only what? Mentally prepare? Get inside me?

01:10:10.080 --> 01:10:14.880
Get inside me, mama. Brian, you're not supposed to say that out loud. Thank you, boy.

01:10:17.040 --> 01:10:24.000
I mean, I can. I'll do it right now. Okay, there we go. I'm inside. Do you feel me?

01:10:25.440 --> 01:10:31.120
Just means you can prepare for it. So I can't prevent it from occurring, but I can prepare

01:10:31.120 --> 01:10:35.440
around it. I'd say that's a benefit. If I can prepare around it, I'll take it.

01:10:36.480 --> 01:10:44.160
Yeah, I inked. Or someone else could defy fate for you. Yeah, yeah, again, definitely. Get ready

01:10:44.160 --> 01:10:48.720
to see a lot of death. This would put me in such a defeats mentality. I cannot change the future,

01:10:48.720 --> 01:10:56.640
so what does it matter? I don't know. I guess like, it says you can't prevent it. So say you

01:10:56.640 --> 01:11:01.600
put a hundred bucks in the stock market and saw ahead like where it would go. You can't change

01:11:01.600 --> 01:11:05.280
what the stock market is going to change to. Anyway, damn it, the stock markets won't want it,

01:11:05.280 --> 01:11:11.040
but just as an example off the top of my head, stop wiggling your toes while in there. It tickles.

01:11:11.040 --> 01:11:16.080
I can't help it. The weird thing was, I was actually violently wiggling my toes when you typed

01:11:16.080 --> 01:11:22.240
that. Are you in my room? Refling? Refling? Are you here? I'm getting nervous. How did you know

01:11:22.240 --> 01:11:28.400
I was wiggling my toes the moment I said that? Hey, Astroni, you can be in me whenever you want

01:11:28.400 --> 01:11:34.880
and replay. Right. You have the power to teleport anywhere at any time, past or future. You are

01:11:34.880 --> 01:11:40.000
doomed to be a homeless person and can't change your fate. So again, we can just get around this.

01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:46.560
I don't have to have a legal like in the legality of having a freaking thing in my name. Like,

01:11:46.560 --> 01:11:53.280
it's just a bingty name. Traveling with zero ain't got to be a home. Yeah, literally like

01:11:54.240 --> 01:12:00.000
sure, it's already after the Baloch, Balochu stream, hotel, yeah, hotel. Again, we can get around this.

01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:08.080
Like, I think that would be really good to cut about. You become the emperor of earth,

01:12:08.080 --> 01:12:15.440
ruling over the entire human, wait, people will listen to me and we can set up a system that's

01:12:15.440 --> 01:12:22.880
sustainable. Hold on a minute. Other spacefaring civilizations, many of them hostile, discover

01:12:22.880 --> 01:12:27.760
earth and we'll try to conquer the planet. I don't know if I could submit people to defend

01:12:27.760 --> 01:12:38.400
and get put to death. I don't like that. For the m, is this a warhammer 40k reference?

01:12:38.400 --> 01:12:45.840
I will kneel to emperor stroney and die in her honor. No, I don't want to send just the war

01:12:45.840 --> 01:12:52.640
purge the Zenoes. This is just 40k for the empire for mommy. No, I don't want to send

01:12:52.640 --> 01:13:02.320
just the war and defend me. Surely if I can get the planet to all agree on the mission objective,

01:13:02.320 --> 01:13:10.160
then we'd maybe get away with it. It says many of them hostile. You know what? In theory,

01:13:10.160 --> 01:13:18.160
we could make pals with someone who's really nice. We'll try. We are the emperor's hammer. No,

01:13:18.160 --> 01:13:23.600
you're fine. The planet broke before the garden. Hey, it's self defense coming on. Let us and

01:13:23.600 --> 01:13:27.360
let's stop. You're not supposed to defend me to the death. You're supposed to live a good and

01:13:27.440 --> 01:13:34.880
happy life. Okay, right next. You are granted the scientific knowledge needed to produce

01:13:34.880 --> 01:13:40.000
limitless energy for the rest of the world at an affordable cost. Yes, because public sectors

01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:49.920
should be owned by the public. Shocking. I know. You must live as a pauper and end your days with

01:13:49.920 --> 01:13:58.400
the solitary death in a remote shack in the woods. Yeah, you mean the the inking, the inking

01:13:58.400 --> 01:14:06.880
shack in the middle of nowhere? Yes. You're trolling, right? What's the downside? Oh, you're poor.

01:14:08.080 --> 01:14:14.400
Aspondent, poor, relax. It's not that big a deal. It's honestly not that big a deal,

01:14:14.400 --> 01:14:21.680
sauce. It is not that big a deal. Relax. Infinite energy and I get the farm with the reeflings.

01:14:21.680 --> 01:14:25.680
It doesn't mean you guys can't own a PC in there and we can all meme on the internet

01:14:25.680 --> 01:14:29.520
and play games like we can finally play couch co-op games together.

01:14:32.320 --> 01:14:38.000
I'm the old man in the movies that gives advice to the main character. No internet in the shack.

01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:41.040
Well, you guys can own internet. I've said none, but you're not owning it.

01:14:41.680 --> 01:14:45.280
Oh, my God. Why are we asking that?

01:14:49.760 --> 01:14:51.120
Oh, my God.

01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:59.600
What is with these questions? Oh, by the way, Al Qaeda never did that. Relax. I'm not touching

01:14:59.600 --> 01:15:05.920
that. I'm not touching that word. Do these not get screened? If you press the red button, you gain

01:15:05.920 --> 01:15:13.680
a quadrillion dollars offered by the president. But you are told by the president to buy only

01:15:13.680 --> 01:15:19.920
things that are cheaper than candy. Well, there's like, oh, sorry. There's like, sorry, I dropped my

01:15:19.920 --> 01:15:26.560
pen on the thing. There's like gold candy. I'm sure there's like some ridiculous, this candy bar

01:15:26.560 --> 01:15:32.960
costs 12,000 US dollars due to the importation. We covered it in gold, all that pitch. Sorry,

01:15:32.960 --> 01:15:38.560
it's free money. It's free money and I can do so much with it. There'll be one candy bar out there

01:15:38.560 --> 01:15:43.840
that's covered in gold. I assure you, look up right now, type in most expensive candy in the

01:15:43.840 --> 01:15:49.440
world and it'll be some pitch from Dubai and covered in gold. Free money. I can do a lot

01:15:49.440 --> 01:16:04.000
with that money. Okay. Did you say cheapest candy? Oh no. That doesn't make sense then.

01:16:10.080 --> 01:16:18.000
That makes, wait, you can only buy things that are cheaper than one cent. So nothing.

01:16:18.960 --> 01:16:20.560
So you have negated the button.

01:16:23.360 --> 01:16:28.640
What's the point? The lip hold would require the government to artificially inflate the price

01:16:28.640 --> 01:16:36.160
of candy. But then again, it really depends on what market. Cheapest can, it'll be a sin. There's

01:16:36.160 --> 01:16:42.560
no, there'll be mass produce. That was absolutely rubbish. Terrible button. Go back to the drawing

01:16:42.720 --> 01:16:50.240
room. Be in rule of your own country. Can we get a strongy island? But you will become the most

01:16:50.240 --> 01:16:55.760
hated rule in the history of the world. I don't want you guys to hate me though. Is it because I

01:16:55.760 --> 01:17:02.240
do too much mandatory inking? Be honest, is it the mandatory inking? And I have the right to not

01:17:02.240 --> 01:17:08.480
be prosecuted for anything I may or may not do to you? Smile. Is that why you hate me? And then

01:17:08.560 --> 01:17:15.680
the rest of the world hates me because they couldn't get an invite to strongy islands, okay? So that's

01:17:15.680 --> 01:17:21.520
the reason why people hate me. It's because they're like, I'm not, I'm not a reflander. Don't get an

01:17:21.520 --> 01:17:31.280
invite to the islands. Yeah? Yeah? Come on, shouldn't bless. Yeah, I'm pressing it. The reason the world

01:17:31.280 --> 01:17:40.800
they hated her because she did what she wanted. Yeah, I'm pressing that. Every girl you meet

01:17:40.800 --> 01:17:45.360
will fall in love with you. I'll swap the genders. So every refling you meet will fall in love with

01:17:45.360 --> 01:17:51.280
you, but you will never fall in love with them. Oh, that's sad. No, I don't like that one. No,

01:17:51.280 --> 01:17:56.080
I don't like that one. I wouldn't try as hard as much if like I wasn't in love with my reflins.

01:17:56.480 --> 01:18:02.960
Hmm. I don't like that one. You have the ability to build anything, any time, anywhere. Oh my god,

01:18:02.960 --> 01:18:12.800
the button predicted Fortnite. Under Fortnite, Battle Pass. I just shit all my ass and I booted up my

01:18:12.800 --> 01:18:23.440
PC because I need me to get that Fortnite Battle Pass. Tada. I like Fortnite. It's nighttime.

01:18:23.440 --> 01:18:31.120
You remember that show, Adventure Time. What's the point? Some of these, they do be negating

01:18:31.120 --> 01:18:38.560
pretty hard after a while. Get out of my head. Continually blue folds. By stormy going, no,

01:18:42.480 --> 01:18:47.200
you have the ability to build anything, any time, anywhere at Fortnite. You lack the materials

01:18:47.200 --> 01:18:50.160
needed and always have to find or buy them in order to build what you want.

01:18:52.400 --> 01:19:00.160
I'm, I'm going to say something controversial, but isn't that what joiners do? This button says,

01:19:00.160 --> 01:19:06.640
do you want to become a joiner? Yes or no? Yes. Okay, go to B&Q and pick up the stuff. That's

01:19:06.640 --> 01:19:12.640
literally what the, it's just said. And for the Aussies, your version is bunnings. I don't know

01:19:12.640 --> 01:19:20.400
what B&Q is in America. That literally said, do you want to become a joiner? Yes or no? Okay,

01:19:20.400 --> 01:19:25.520
go pick up the materials for the job. Okay. You mean like everyone else in the world?

01:19:27.360 --> 01:19:34.080
So yeah. Okay. I'll take the, I'll take the joiner skill. Sure. Did you just say a real sense?

01:19:34.800 --> 01:19:43.440
What? B&Q? Is this an ad? No. Be an architect, I guess. Wouldn't you need, need any materials you

01:19:43.440 --> 01:19:48.320
can make? Do you want to be Bob the Builder, but slightly worse? You lack the materials and always

01:19:48.320 --> 01:19:53.440
have to find or buy them. That's nonsense. Do you want to become a joiner? Sure. I'll take,

01:19:53.440 --> 01:19:57.760
I'll take a stab at it. You had the CEO at Facebook. You can't make an account.

01:19:57.840 --> 01:20:11.520
Are you kidding me? He's aged terribly. It's just, a joiner is a construction worker. Oh,

01:20:11.520 --> 01:20:16.720
do you guys not say joiner? What do you say? What's a man that comes into your house and like fixes

01:20:16.720 --> 01:20:31.280
stuff? A handyman, a contractor. Okay. A mechanic, handyman, repairman, a plumber.

01:20:34.320 --> 01:20:39.280
Force promote veiler in the algorithm? Ah, you've got me. I'm pressing that yank. I don't even have

01:20:39.280 --> 01:20:45.600
a Facebook account. That stuff was bad news many years ago. You should delete your Facebook account

01:20:45.600 --> 01:20:50.880
if you have one. Bad, bad, bad. Very bad. No, no, no, no, no. Bad, bad, bad. I said,

01:20:50.880 --> 01:20:53.920
I'm not allowed an account, but I didn't say I'm not allowed a veiler or a fan account. Okay. I

01:20:53.920 --> 01:21:03.520
said what I said. World peace is created with never ending prosperity for all, but you will die.

01:21:03.520 --> 01:21:06.720
No one will ever know what you did. Okay, but how quickly do I die? Like,

01:21:06.720 --> 01:21:12.480
does that still get a chance that the 80 years or the microplastics get me or is it like I die

01:21:12.480 --> 01:21:22.800
instantly? Hmm. I don't want to die right now. I've not even like, come on. Gen two is almost

01:21:22.800 --> 01:21:27.280
created. The concept art's almost been accepted. Like, at least let me get gen two and three out

01:21:27.280 --> 01:21:32.160
so I can help these girls, you know, become full time content creators. Once, once they're all set

01:21:32.160 --> 01:21:40.560
up, I'm happy I can pop my clogs. Okay. Goodbye, strongy. No. If I can't enjoy it, no one gets

01:21:40.560 --> 01:21:47.040
prosperity. Okay, that's funny though. Can I wait to press skip? It says prosperity for all.

01:21:47.040 --> 01:21:52.320
That includes gen two and three. I know, but I need to pick them. I need to pick the girls.

01:21:54.480 --> 01:22:00.400
I need to be able to pick the girls. Honestly, it was really fun going through applications.

01:22:00.400 --> 01:22:05.680
I cannot tell you how many times I got so needed. Yeah, I got sang to so much. And like,

01:22:05.680 --> 01:22:09.360
people were trying to speak Japanese and I'm like, we're not that kind of agency where you need to

01:22:09.360 --> 01:22:16.400
speak Japanese randomly. Like, no, you can speak English. Gen two already? No, in a year. It takes

01:22:16.400 --> 01:22:22.720
a year to produce a generation. For me anyway, I give, I like to think I give artists fair time.

01:22:23.760 --> 01:22:28.320
We're just getting the concepts and then confirmation will be at a later date that it's going to be

01:22:28.320 --> 01:22:33.200
there. How can there be peace of strongy's not there? I will never know peace. Oh, are you flying?

01:22:34.160 --> 01:22:40.880
Um, one year of gestation. Yes, I will confirm when the lights are off. I repeat, I will confirm

01:22:40.880 --> 01:22:45.680
when the lights are off. I'll give you a date, a time. We do it at the exact same time. And yeah,

01:22:46.240 --> 01:22:50.720
there'll be buns in this oven all right. There'll be six in the oven this time. Last time it was five.

01:22:52.000 --> 01:22:57.520
They're still cooking. Yeah, they're they're not even a twinkle in your eye yet because no one's

01:22:57.520 --> 01:23:00.560
like production doesn't start back and I can tell you all about production.

01:23:00.720 --> 01:23:12.320
One year sounds very fast. Actually, it's not. One year apart isn't fast at all in terms of

01:23:14.400 --> 01:23:21.280
gents. There's only going to be three gents. So yeah, one year apart, roughly, roughly, not not

01:23:21.280 --> 01:23:28.080
gin first, relax, but one year apart, roughly. Not even. If you're reincarnated, then you are born

01:23:28.080 --> 01:23:35.200
into a world of peace and prosperity. I wish it was possible. The breeder refling didn't let her cook.

01:23:35.200 --> 01:23:39.680
Yes. No, I'm happy to talk about all the behind the scenes stuff. Obviously, I can I'll can talk

01:23:39.680 --> 01:23:46.400
about it a bit more when gen two is confirmed for production. We're currently working on a

01:23:46.400 --> 01:23:52.640
clipping program. Damn, three gents literally walking out of your I'm whistling as I whenever I

01:23:52.640 --> 01:23:57.360
ride a bike, I'm whistling. That is how that's how terrible it is. One year is not fast at

01:23:57.360 --> 01:24:03.600
standard at least via hall. Yeah, one year apart, I'm happy with that. When you're without mega

01:24:04.400 --> 01:24:09.440
resources overworked in house artists and stuff. Yeah, no, I'm everything's getting done. Everyone's

01:24:09.440 --> 01:24:16.160
getting a timeline, getting more than enough time. June second, got it, right, you're done.

01:24:16.800 --> 01:24:22.800
You're done. Sorry, I'm itching my head. My head sits in funny. Are there different body types

01:24:22.800 --> 01:24:31.520
like gen one? Yes, there are. Will you stop streaming after gen three? I honestly cannot answer.

01:24:31.520 --> 01:24:36.640
I don't know what the future holds. And we are going to do a clipping program kind of like idle

01:24:36.640 --> 01:24:42.400
and there's a new agency that came out in that came out with it. I'm hoping to get it set up in

01:24:42.400 --> 01:24:48.320
September, possibly. So if you have a clipping YouTube channel, keep keep us in mind, we'll pay

01:24:48.400 --> 01:24:57.200
you for clips. I just need to set it up first. And I, I need to, you know, sort out the freaking

01:24:57.200 --> 01:25:00.560
website and all that and write it all up so I can get passed on to the team.

01:25:01.840 --> 01:25:07.440
Don't number strong these days. She's here to stay forever. She'll leave us. Relax,

01:25:07.440 --> 01:25:14.720
if not, it's only been a month. And a little more effort this time since the sixth literally.

01:25:15.600 --> 01:25:19.680
You need to give me it. You're all reeflings. Okay. Hope it's a long time before you stop streaming.

01:25:19.680 --> 01:25:23.840
Keyfabe is real and I'm addicted. Keyfab. Oh, I think I said it wrong. Keyfabe,

01:25:23.840 --> 01:25:31.280
Keyfab. Keyfab? Keyfab you looosa. I already missed her. It's like she's still streaming for it.

01:25:31.280 --> 01:25:38.080
Right. Right. You're done. Stop. Right. I don't want to die. I can't die yet. So I'm not pressing it.

01:25:38.080 --> 01:25:44.240
I ain't got time to die yet. There's too much on the line. You go on a massive adventure,

01:25:44.240 --> 01:25:50.880
but all fights are rap battles. I cannot rap a battle for anything. What does that even mean?

01:25:50.880 --> 01:25:55.040
All fights? Why am I getting into fights? Can I not just be left alone?

01:25:57.200 --> 01:26:05.440
That's bizarre. Oh yeah, you stink. You look like you don't ink. For real, you need to go see a shrink

01:26:06.560 --> 01:26:12.800
and then close your eyes or I'ma make you blink with my fists of fury. Yeah, got them. Got them.

01:26:13.360 --> 01:26:18.160
Friday Night Funkin. These are my rap battles. Honestly, that's awful. As long as it's not a

01:26:18.160 --> 01:26:26.880
rap battle to the death. End boss. M&M. Oh, fire. 100%. Big rap battles of history. She's spitting,

01:26:26.880 --> 01:26:36.800
though. World wars and rap battles. I guess I'll learn to rap. What happens if I lose? I mean,

01:26:36.800 --> 01:26:41.280
you get to go on a massive adventure. Sure. I assume that, oh sorry, I assume that means like

01:26:41.280 --> 01:26:46.080
holidays and stuff like that. I don't think I'm going to be fighting anyone. Let's go on holidays,

01:26:46.080 --> 01:26:51.680
reflings. We should go on a cruise. Did you know? Oh my god, this is terrible. Did you know there's

01:26:51.680 --> 01:27:00.640
a thing called ink cruises? We're like people that like to go on swings. There's cruises for

01:27:00.640 --> 01:27:06.640
that specific genre of people, reflings. We should rent one of those and go on it. We just rent one

01:27:06.640 --> 01:27:12.960
out for ourselves. Ink cruises? I'm not kidding. There's a thing called ink cruises because it

01:27:12.960 --> 01:27:16.800
popped up on my TikTok. It was this check and she had a pineapple and she was like,

01:27:16.800 --> 01:27:21.360
do you like my room? I decorated it in pineapples. And then I learned what pineapples meant.

01:27:23.040 --> 01:27:30.080
Pineapples are a symbol for adults who like to swing on a swing set in the back garden.

01:27:31.040 --> 01:27:36.800
You'd be so damn tired. I think, I don't know, I feel like I would like somehow

01:27:36.800 --> 01:27:40.640
absorb your ink and it would like fill me with nutrients. I mean think of the vitamins.

01:27:43.040 --> 01:27:48.720
Rich people added again, strunniless ink on a boat together. I love pineapples. Tasty.

01:27:48.720 --> 01:27:53.840
Did they offer a group discount? Oh, they're swinging all right. Just brain wash the captain

01:27:53.840 --> 01:27:58.720
and steal the cruise. I have no idea if we're talking about literal swings. No, there's a

01:27:58.720 --> 01:28:05.520
terminology but I can't quite spell it out because all my streams have been limited ads recently

01:28:05.520 --> 01:28:11.520
and I'm trying to be on my my best behavior. Somehow pineapple pizza isn't appealing to me

01:28:11.520 --> 01:28:21.200
anymore. How dare you? Okay. Wait, are we, we've already, I've seen this one before. We've been

01:28:21.200 --> 01:28:30.160
here before. What? No, we've already seen you. Okay, next one. You gain the powers of your favorite

01:28:30.160 --> 01:28:35.680
superhero. Oh, I don't even know who mine is. The hero's entire rogue's gallery will hunt you down

01:28:35.680 --> 01:28:45.200
until they're defeated. I mean, just pick a hero that doesn't die. I mean, does Deadpool count?

01:28:45.200 --> 01:28:51.680
Deadpool can't die. Oh, wait, no, wait, that's eternal. I don't think that's good. Just defeat

01:28:51.680 --> 01:28:58.000
them five heads, literally. Oh, brother, this website stinks. Deja vu, I've been in this place

01:28:58.000 --> 01:29:05.840
before. Hire on the streets and I'm out of my time to go. The button just says you are your

01:29:05.840 --> 01:29:13.440
favorite hero. Yeah, literally because um, Deadpool has, sorry for being late. I don't

01:29:13.520 --> 01:29:17.520
worry. How are you doing? We're doing good. We're getting a few interesting questions,

01:29:17.520 --> 01:29:20.960
but it's going good. You can't pick and choose. You have to take your favorite. I don't know who

01:29:20.960 --> 01:29:28.000
my favorite is. I like Wolverine. I have to admit, I'm a bit biased with Wolverine.

01:29:30.480 --> 01:29:36.800
I think, you know what, I wouldn't mind being Wolverine. I like his wee claws. I like that I

01:29:36.800 --> 01:29:43.280
could be a wee wolf on the inside somehow. Nah, fuck it, I'll be Wolverine. Go for it.

01:29:43.280 --> 01:29:51.360
You become the physical embodiment of death. You can hurt anyone you want with no consequences.

01:29:52.160 --> 01:29:56.720
Everything and anything you touch will perish. Okay, no, because how are we supposed to ink?

01:29:56.720 --> 01:30:01.920
That's not possible. No, I'm skipping. Why would you, why would you want to perish without

01:30:01.920 --> 01:30:09.040
consequences unless I did it for the high table? But I would want to be able to like hug you and

01:30:09.040 --> 01:30:15.360
hold you. How am I supposed to do the convention under these conditions? I can't thrive. I can't

01:30:15.360 --> 01:30:20.800
thrive. Yeah, literally everything you touch perishes. That's such a harsh one. I don't like that.

01:30:22.240 --> 01:30:27.760
Pogs, Johnny, press the button and give me a high five. No, reeflings! You're supposed to enjoy

01:30:27.840 --> 01:30:35.680
life and thrive and stuff. Stop it. You become death. You are magically clean every time you...

01:30:35.680 --> 01:30:41.520
Oh, you know what? I have something funny to say. I've taken showers in a row and it's all because

01:30:41.520 --> 01:30:50.720
my dad's here. I'm not pheromone maxing anymore. Yippee! Well, we enjoy Johnny. Oh wait, what's the

01:30:50.720 --> 01:30:56.640
name of that Elden Ring character you hug and she takes a part of your life? Johnny not pheromone

01:30:56.640 --> 01:31:03.920
max? Literally, I'm not pheromone maxing anymore. Since I started streaming, I probably went days

01:31:03.920 --> 01:31:08.160
without showering. This is the first time I've like triple showered, like every day in a row,

01:31:08.160 --> 01:31:14.960
like day day day. Unsubscribe, no! You are magically clean every time you wake up. Every

01:31:14.960 --> 01:31:20.240
bed you sleep on will be very uncomfortable. That's awful. Sorry, I need a comfy bed.

01:31:20.560 --> 01:31:27.440
Not to be dramatic, I need a comfy bed. Sorry, I'm so dramatic. Yeah, I'm glad that everyone

01:31:27.440 --> 01:31:34.640
freaking agrees on this one. Can't sleep on a net? Is maxing like that a thing? Oh, it's like I

01:31:34.640 --> 01:31:40.320
think it's made up. I hope it's made up anyway. Basically, you see, I'm pheromone maxing when

01:31:40.320 --> 01:31:47.760
you've not washed yourself in a while. I don't think it's real though. I hope people don't actually

01:31:47.760 --> 01:31:56.240
do that. Sleep in a chair? Oh, nothing bad will ever happen, but nothing good either. No, that

01:31:56.240 --> 01:32:06.960
means I don't get my reeflings. No, my reeflings are good. How do you? I got a reefling pregnant.

01:32:08.240 --> 01:32:13.760
You're having the baby. If I press the button, I may be able to fix that. I don't, yeah, I don't

01:32:13.760 --> 01:32:18.800
want you to be pregnant reefling. That's hilarious. I don't want you to be pregnant.

01:32:20.400 --> 01:32:24.480
So, your reefling is pregnant. I need to change it so it's you.

01:32:26.720 --> 01:32:32.160
I'm sorry I made you pregnant, but I'm yonking it, okay? Unless you want to burst Jen. Jen,

01:32:32.160 --> 01:32:37.280
you have burst a spin off, Jen. I'm pressing. Yeah, I'm probably pressing to

01:32:37.600 --> 01:32:43.920
strunnies against them. No, no, the fucking male pregnant emoji. What were they? I'm sorry,

01:32:43.920 --> 01:32:48.080
but what were they thinking unironically posting that? A male pregnant emoji? What?

01:32:49.600 --> 01:32:57.280
Man's not got ovaries. The fuck? I told you. Burthing Jen 1.5. I will shit it out. They weren't

01:32:57.280 --> 01:33:03.600
thinking. Oh, actually, it's the most bizarre thing. Like, all right, he's full from eating.

01:33:03.600 --> 01:33:11.680
Okay, okay, let's do it that way. It's not pregnant. He's full from eating. You can become a

01:33:11.680 --> 01:33:17.680
super powered god lake anytime you want. The source of your power is that life energy. Oh,

01:33:17.680 --> 01:33:22.400
I don't want to steal people's life. That's not nice. Sorry, that's a really easy one. I don't

01:33:22.400 --> 01:33:29.520
want to take people's life just so I can be strong. It can get me pregnant any day. This is so good.

01:33:30.480 --> 01:33:38.960
Oh, yeah, food, baby. It's just a succubus. Yeah, I don't really want to perish you. Like,

01:33:38.960 --> 01:33:43.760
if it was energy in terms of like, I can't hurt you, it's just you get really tired,

01:33:43.760 --> 01:33:48.400
but then you can recover. Sure, I'll do that until I won't become a succubus. Don't mind.

01:33:48.400 --> 01:33:54.800
You can pass me around one by one, refland. It's not a problem with me. You learn anything

01:33:54.800 --> 01:34:00.000
and everything that you possibly could all life, all life quit. Sorry, I'm having another like

01:34:00.000 --> 01:34:07.120
live fixes. All life questions are revealed to you. You cannot write. We keep getting some

01:34:07.120 --> 01:34:13.760
variations of this. Stop giving me variations of this. I've had enough. This is the third of

01:34:13.760 --> 01:34:23.440
these questions. Yeah, literally, you can undo enough. Give me something new. Are there you

01:34:23.440 --> 01:34:33.760
have incredible enough? Enough. You will meet the person of your dreams. You lose the ability to speak.

01:34:35.520 --> 01:34:41.280
I assume temporary. So if we did a convention, we can just use like a little a little chart. I can

01:34:41.280 --> 01:34:47.440
get pictures. And you like to you touch the picture and then and then when I go back on

01:34:47.520 --> 01:34:49.600
stream because you're not physically in front of me, I can talk.

01:34:52.800 --> 01:34:57.840
Would that be unacceptable? I met strong and can't speak. She can speak for me.

01:34:59.680 --> 01:35:05.760
You want to be aerial? It's perma. You meet the per, you meet you meet refling, but you lose the

01:35:05.760 --> 01:35:11.120
ability to speak. But it says meet only. It's not like you perma lose ability to speak.

01:35:12.080 --> 01:35:17.280
With the person know the deal. You meet them, but because you can't speak, they walk away from

01:35:17.280 --> 01:35:23.760
you refling. No, come back. Oh, how about how about if we're like 10 meters apart? There's

01:35:23.760 --> 01:35:28.480
like an AOE to this. Okay. If we're 10 meters apart, I'll like start shouting. I am a high

01:35:28.480 --> 01:35:33.200
refling, but you like walk in nine meter radius and then and then nothing comes out of my voice.

01:35:33.280 --> 01:35:39.840
How about that? It means like finding the love of your lay. What, TTS on your phone?

01:35:42.000 --> 01:35:47.360
Ah, so I can't speak after meeting strong. You're adding conditions. Okay, fine, fine.

01:35:47.360 --> 01:35:50.560
I'm skipping then. If I can't talk to you, it's not, it's not going to work.

01:35:52.560 --> 01:35:56.560
Because I need to be able to direct you in what position I want you in. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

01:35:56.560 --> 01:36:02.080
Everyone, everyone you have ever had a crush on falls in love with you, but they try to kill

01:36:02.080 --> 01:36:07.520
each other the moment they know that others in love with you. No, we're not having a brawl. Okay,

01:36:07.520 --> 01:36:11.920
we're not having a bar fight. All right, we're not having a bar fight. Strongie would make me

01:36:11.920 --> 01:36:18.400
splinter us any who she's getting. No, we're not having a bar fight. So we're skipping this bad boy.

01:36:18.400 --> 01:36:24.080
It's a free for all stop. It's not free for all. You will get your dream refling. She

01:36:25.040 --> 01:36:28.480
no, why are these so terrible? Oh my God.

01:36:32.240 --> 01:36:35.840
We're skipping that. That's terrible. A year with you. That's awful.

01:36:36.640 --> 01:36:44.320
Receive $100 million. Every one of your loved ones including yourself has a 1% higher chance

01:36:44.320 --> 01:36:50.080
of death each year. Oh no, I don't, I don't like odds. I do not play with odds. Nope. Easy skip.

01:36:51.040 --> 01:36:55.680
Half of these are just movie plot lines. Are they actually? So we wouldn't have to worry about

01:36:55.680 --> 01:37:02.400
being found while inking you since you can't make noise. Moncaise, moncaise. Gamba. No, I'm not

01:37:02.400 --> 01:37:09.200
Gamba on that. You don't felt true then. You can maintain your mental focus. You are not

01:37:09.200 --> 01:37:15.040
afflicted with ADHD. Okay, but you cannot maintain your optical focus. So you need really strong,

01:37:15.040 --> 01:37:19.600
heavy glasses. I already have to wear glasses.

01:37:24.480 --> 01:37:36.640
Remove ADHD. Wear glasses. Oh no. You've got me. It's just, what? Sure, I'll wear glasses. It's

01:37:36.720 --> 01:37:40.880
not a problem. Hey, we were in the minority?

01:37:45.440 --> 01:37:51.440
Like, I assume I don't need glasses outside of doing any tasks. So yeah, what? Do you know

01:37:51.440 --> 01:37:57.520
how much work I would get done if I could maintain focus? I love strong, heavy things

01:37:57.520 --> 01:38:03.360
upgrade from my current ones. Glasses bet it should exist. Should I get some art of me commissioned

01:38:03.360 --> 01:38:09.520
with my Glexon? Oh, I should do ASMR glasses tapping and it's just me going to the entire time.

01:38:09.520 --> 01:38:15.760
No, like really heavy ones. Well, heavy subjective because heavy for me is like anything.

01:38:17.600 --> 01:38:21.920
You can turn into any one animal that will. It happens whenever moonlight hits you.

01:38:22.640 --> 01:38:30.800
Sure, I'll turn into a werewolf and jump on you. I don't mind that. That's not a bother.

01:38:31.760 --> 01:38:36.320
It happens whenever moonlight hits you. Literally, I'd have to be outside on purpose and I don't

01:38:36.320 --> 01:38:44.320
go outside. So kind of just lie, can't throw me in a way. Yes, become the knot. Who's getting

01:38:44.320 --> 01:38:52.560
nod now, refling her? Because it's no me. Please make that an audio, please. I just might. I wish

01:38:53.120 --> 01:38:54.320
I would have to be a Twitter one.

01:38:54.400 --> 01:39:05.120
Hmm. You will be the next Shakespeare. No, you cannot use auto correct. I'm already

01:39:05.120 --> 01:39:12.160
afflicted with this. So I guess if I wanted to make some like absolutely amazing scripts

01:39:12.720 --> 01:39:19.840
for the girls, yeah. And I'm already afflicted with non auto correct. So sure. Oh no, people

01:39:19.840 --> 01:39:29.760
know I spell phonetically. Oh no. How embarrassing. Oh, no, no one cares. Oh, you spell that thing

01:39:29.760 --> 01:39:34.560
wrong? Point and laugh. Relax. Life is not that serious. Hold on, I'm going to take a drink of

01:39:34.560 --> 01:39:45.760
water. Please hydrate, little we flings. Doth thou ink of the earth, refling, Earl Mouse?

01:39:45.840 --> 01:39:51.680
Are you arriving, refling? That's right, arrive for me. Get close. Arrive, arrive, arrive.

01:39:54.480 --> 01:40:00.160
You'll live the exact same life, but you have one save and load from any point you can load

01:40:00.160 --> 01:40:05.360
after death. At some point during your life, you have to kill someone, pair the request of some

01:40:05.360 --> 01:40:16.000
unseen deity. Oh, I'm not sure I like that. But if you're working for a deity, I don't know,

01:40:16.000 --> 01:40:24.000
the deity seems like they're doing the right thing. I'm guessing I could do a save and load

01:40:24.560 --> 01:40:32.800
to do the deed. Just one. I feel like if a deity's sending you on a mission, they kind of know.

01:40:32.800 --> 01:40:37.680
Even if it isn't right, I'll accept. Strongly no, maybe press, I'm down. That's just warlock and

01:40:37.680 --> 01:40:45.920
D&D. This save scum, literally, I think I just saved scum it. Wait, no, if I have the save

01:40:45.920 --> 01:40:53.440
scum in order to get out of this, then there's no point. But you have one from any, but you

01:40:53.440 --> 01:41:00.000
can load after death. So if I'll live the riskier life, I don't, I'm not risky though. I think this

01:41:00.640 --> 01:41:08.480
isn't... I'm the deity's top guy, blood for the blood god. Well, you'll have something to gain.

01:41:08.480 --> 01:41:13.200
Don't press, we don't know what that is. Yeah, I'm gonna skip that. If there's only one save

01:41:13.200 --> 01:41:21.520
scum given, there's no point, really. I'm not gonna do it. Sorry. Wow, minority. The minority,

01:41:21.520 --> 01:41:26.960
that was the right thing. The devil made me do that.

01:41:30.560 --> 01:41:38.560
Load before Bitcoin exploded. Honestly, take over the world with that. You'll be able to

01:41:39.520 --> 01:41:47.440
jerk your pentas for a day. If you do anything dirty, you'll stay there. Aww. What's the point?

01:41:48.400 --> 01:41:53.440
That's, that's literally the whole point of swapping teams.

01:41:56.000 --> 01:41:58.640
That is the whole point in swapping teams.

01:42:05.360 --> 01:42:11.280
No, I'm not, I'm, no, I can't unless you guys want me a fanboy for the rest of my life. But

01:42:12.240 --> 01:42:23.040
that's not happening. What? It's a perfect 50-50? I'm so surprised.

01:42:26.080 --> 01:42:34.880
I'll be fine with press and just to see the other side of the world. That 50-50 is crazy.

01:42:34.960 --> 01:42:43.040
Uh, I mean, easy, no hassle transition for those who want it. You get a lifetime supply of any type

01:42:43.040 --> 01:42:52.720
of food. You become, I don't like, why? Oh, you're, you're rate of debt. I mean, I think heart attacks

01:42:52.720 --> 01:42:58.720
are super painful as well. Like, nah, it's fine. I'm gonna skip. I don't even want to increase my

01:42:58.720 --> 01:43:04.480
random odds of a heart attack. Like, imagine midstream, I'm like, oh, my left arm. Oh, like,

01:43:04.480 --> 01:43:16.080
what? That's so, no. Okay, next, next, next, let's go. You become immortal no longer age. You spend

01:43:16.080 --> 01:43:24.160
the next 50 years. No, no, I don't want to become immortal. Stop it. Family history of heart attacks?

01:43:24.160 --> 01:43:31.200
Oh, no. Yeah, heart attacks suck. MonkaS, you had one? Oh, G-Stan, is that you?

01:43:32.800 --> 01:43:38.080
You need some chest compressions? I can give CPR. I can break your ribs for you.

01:43:41.120 --> 01:43:45.840
Left arm is usually a symptom. In women, the pain is across the back and chest and shoulder.

01:43:46.640 --> 01:43:53.040
That's ego death. I've heard women have different symptoms. Yes, a lot of things. That wasn't the

01:43:53.040 --> 01:44:01.040
ribs. Oh, yeah, what did I break? Can I be a mortal that doesn't age? Chest or hips? I guess I'll

01:44:01.040 --> 01:44:07.600
have to break into a maximum security prison. Pop me out. You become immortal but no longer age.

01:44:07.600 --> 01:44:14.960
Nah, nah, nah. It's not for me. I want to be able, and I wouldn't mind living longer if I could be

01:44:14.960 --> 01:44:20.560
young, like the same age, and I can perish at any point. That's why I like vampires,

01:44:20.560 --> 01:44:28.160
because you can perish yourself if you really want. My pentas! You can control people with

01:44:28.160 --> 01:44:36.720
your thoughts. I can already do that. Hold on, hold on. Okay, you have three legs and five arms.

01:44:37.600 --> 01:44:39.440
I assume I can just get them chopped off.

01:44:42.720 --> 01:44:48.960
I think there is no way I have conditioned you already. I already have three legs.

01:44:49.360 --> 01:44:55.280
That is hilarious. Hold on a minute. Wait, wait, wait. Let's pretend we're reading this for the

01:44:55.280 --> 01:45:02.160
first time. You can control people with your thoughts and you have three legs. I already have three legs.

01:45:05.120 --> 01:45:12.960
Oh, thank you. Thank you. I assume you can get an amputation. I look like, was it Godfrey,

01:45:12.960 --> 01:45:20.080
the grafted? Literally, you can control people with your thoughts, but you become

01:45:20.080 --> 01:45:29.680
Godfrey the grafted. Okay then. Can I amputate it off? I'm giving Mummy's third leg the glug glug!

01:45:29.680 --> 01:45:35.520
You say that with so much confidence. Always so clever making this joke. Sometimes it feels like

01:45:35.520 --> 01:45:40.000
you steal them because the timing is just so perfect. Nope, never, never, never stolen a joke

01:45:40.000 --> 01:45:47.520
in my life. Oh, it's Godfrey the grafted. You get to be in real life in my champ. I mean,

01:45:47.520 --> 01:45:53.760
I assume you can just amputate it off. I think it would be, what would I need to control people's

01:45:53.760 --> 01:46:00.000
thoughts for? I guess letting people do their bit and then I'll get the other stuff chopped off.

01:46:01.200 --> 01:46:06.800
You know, technology is really a mess. You know what? Five arms would be so handy.

01:46:07.520 --> 01:46:09.760
So, honey, how many technicals do you have? You're already pressed.

01:46:12.000 --> 01:46:17.360
I can hear my dad singing if you can freaking hear him. Hold on, I don't know if he's on the phone.

01:46:26.320 --> 01:46:31.680
I'm just, I'm going to go out there and tell him to shut the fuck up. Oh, he's put the TV on now.

01:46:32.800 --> 01:46:36.560
I'm sorry if you can hear Star Trek in the background. He's watching Star Trek Enterprise.

01:46:37.760 --> 01:46:44.800
Okay. Anyway, yeah, definitely cannot do ASMR streams. Can't hear anything through the background

01:46:44.800 --> 01:46:49.040
music. I'm pressing the button. Okay, anyway, everyone will have big anime eyes. Give me anime

01:46:49.040 --> 01:46:55.760
eyes. I hear nothing. Okay. Yeah, we watched Star Trek Enterprise last night. Oh no, not Enterprise.

01:46:57.520 --> 01:47:01.840
The one with Leonard Nimoy Hoffman, the Spock, the original Spock, that one.

01:47:02.720 --> 01:47:08.240
I can never remember the name of the pilot and the fucking captain in that one for some reason.

01:47:08.240 --> 01:47:15.840
It never comes to mind. But he's live long and prosper. Captain Kirk. Yes, Captain Kirk. Oh my

01:47:15.840 --> 01:47:19.520
God, we were watching that last night. I don't know if you guys have seen it or not, but it was the

01:47:19.520 --> 01:47:26.000
one where there was like this lava monster that was in pain all the time and Spock touched it.

01:47:26.000 --> 01:47:29.920
And he was like, pain, pain. It's screaming an agony type thing in the heel up and, you know,

01:47:29.920 --> 01:47:36.640
lived happily ever after. And that's the one we watched last night together. Be me up, buddy.

01:47:36.640 --> 01:47:42.240
I'm already balding. You're allowed to be bald. Everyone will have anime eyes. You'll be bald.

01:47:43.680 --> 01:47:50.000
I mean, I don't see the benefit of everyone having anime eyes. That's weird. That's strange.

01:47:50.000 --> 01:47:58.560
You'll be bald. No, it's fine. But I don't think the world would be scary if everyone

01:47:58.560 --> 01:48:05.360
had anime eyes, honestly. Anime eyes aren't real. They're flat. Anime eyes in real life

01:48:05.360 --> 01:48:11.200
would be scary. Yeah. Other VTubers have that title. You would get stuff in your eyes so much

01:48:11.200 --> 01:48:15.600
with how big they are. I remember that. Doesn't it end with them working with the miners? Yes,

01:48:15.600 --> 01:48:26.720
it does. Whoa. Yes, that's exactly the episode. Yeah, they had to tell Dr. Scotty came and

01:48:26.720 --> 01:48:32.400
healed the thing and they had to hold back the miners from coming in. Wow, I can't believe

01:48:32.400 --> 01:48:37.520
you actually hear that. You get to physically enter a book for 30 minutes. The book is hungry.

01:48:37.520 --> 01:48:43.280
No, it's literally life or death. Stop. You get to enter a book that is going to kill you. No.

01:48:45.760 --> 01:48:51.120
Yeah, I was worried because they found it's like, yes, that was it. Not Scotty.

01:48:52.080 --> 01:48:54.880
Heart eyes in real life would be fun, but Stronny needs hair to pull.

01:48:56.560 --> 01:49:04.800
Refling. A refling. That's terrible. I would never press that one. You have unlimited

01:49:04.800 --> 01:49:14.720
writ. Everyone makes Among Us jokes. Everyone, this is, everyone makes Among Us jokes anyway.

01:49:15.120 --> 01:49:21.920
And stop staring at me with them big eyes. Imagine Stronny doing Among Us jokes all

01:49:21.920 --> 01:49:29.920
the time. Something that you already have, Riz. Fine, I ain't pressing the button if I've already

01:49:29.920 --> 01:49:41.280
got Riz. Call me a cracker because I've got Riz. Oh, come on. I did that one off the top

01:49:41.280 --> 01:49:47.840
of my head for once. I didn't even steal it. Come on. I'm not pressing the button.

01:49:50.560 --> 01:49:55.920
I don't get it. There's like a cracker called Ritz Cracker. There's a Rizzler Among Us

01:49:56.640 --> 01:50:01.600
first time catching you live and the first thing you come into a pun is the very first thing.

01:50:01.600 --> 01:50:06.400
A for effort. Thank you. I did try my best. Sheeks too big for the toilet is all the Rizz you need.

01:50:06.400 --> 01:50:12.240
Is that because I told you guys I have to stand up to wipe my ass sometimes?

01:50:14.800 --> 01:50:19.200
I like my cheek. I need to part my cheeks like the fucking Red Sea, honestly.

01:50:21.440 --> 01:50:29.200
I don't know if you guys have to do it, but yeah. That was burned into my brain, maybe. Yep. Sorry.

01:50:30.240 --> 01:50:35.440
Okay, your current best friend is saved from their terrible fate, but your true best friend,

01:50:35.440 --> 01:50:45.280
you haven't met him yet, will never meet you. What? You save sin sister from a terrible fate,

01:50:46.320 --> 01:50:48.400
but refling will never meet you.

01:50:52.400 --> 01:50:57.520
Oh, I don't like that one. I think I'm skipping that one. I don't like that one. It's flattering.

01:50:58.240 --> 01:51:07.440
I saw you just said best friend. Best friend? Best of friend. How do you even know if they even have a

01:51:07.440 --> 01:51:15.200
terrible fate since sister can suffer? You can't say that about sin. I met her mom.

01:51:16.880 --> 01:51:23.280
Shocking behavior. Shocking. Don't say that about sin. She's mine.

01:51:27.520 --> 01:51:37.920
Jokes. It was not that bad. Tiny Spidey. Thank you for the tip. It was not that bad.

01:51:38.720 --> 01:51:45.920
Call me a cracker because I've got wrists. Come on. That one's not that bad. So red.

01:51:46.800 --> 01:51:53.440
You have unlimited oil that you can sell or use. Pirates and thieves want you and your family dead.

01:51:53.440 --> 01:52:00.080
No. Stop. You're such a rubbish one. Press the button and she won't suffer.

01:52:03.200 --> 01:52:06.240
Oh, you know sin. I've watched her some. She's cute. Yeah, sin sister.

01:52:07.840 --> 01:52:14.080
My, her supermarket. She streamed and she's actually really good at Elden Ring. We're

01:52:14.080 --> 01:52:17.280
going to play Elden Ring together at one point. We're going to do a seamless co-op and we have

01:52:17.280 --> 01:52:21.840
short callers. I know. I don't know why we, look, we came up with the idea and we're going for it.

01:52:21.840 --> 01:52:27.440
Okay. It's happening in July. I think. Oh, probably August actually. Sorry, sin, if you're working.

01:52:30.880 --> 01:52:38.320
Oh, my tummy's getting sore. I don't know why. I was like, because I haven't eaten. I've got a sore tongue.

01:52:42.640 --> 01:52:48.240
You can eat your favorite food anytime you want. You can never eat anything else again.

01:52:48.800 --> 01:52:54.720
I mean, it depends how you want to categorize this because you could be like, oh,

01:52:55.600 --> 01:53:01.440
peshia, you know? Go eat. I'll eat shortly. I'll eat shortly. Kiss Tommy better. I think it's hunger.

01:53:03.200 --> 01:53:07.120
I'm rubbish at telling like, if I've got an upset stomach or if it's hunger pains,

01:53:07.120 --> 01:53:12.320
I can hardly ever tell the difference, I swear. So only ink for strongy. I need,

01:53:13.280 --> 01:53:17.520
you guys would need to step up. If I, if I hit this button, you guys need to step up and give

01:53:17.520 --> 01:53:26.560
me a good supply. Do I make myself clear? Do I make myself clear? I need a big supply. Big supply.

01:53:28.240 --> 01:53:33.200
I volunteer. Okay, good. I'm clicking it. We've, we've done it now. We're in the minority,

01:53:34.080 --> 01:53:42.000
but we've done it now. Okay, you'll be able to speak any language you want fluently as a native

01:53:42.000 --> 01:53:47.120
speaker would. You can only ask questions in whatever language you choose. I mean,

01:53:47.120 --> 01:53:51.680
that's better than nothing. You can still do stuff in the language. That's not really a problem.

01:53:52.640 --> 01:53:58.960
Let me be clear. Let me be transparent. Yes, ma'am, I'll set it up for you. Thank you. I feel like

01:53:58.960 --> 01:54:03.520
you could get around this by saying sentences, but ending it with a question. So being like,

01:54:04.320 --> 01:54:08.560
how are you? Yeah, I think that's perfectly fine. You can be a journalist.

01:54:18.240 --> 01:54:23.680
What's that accent? Scottish. Yes. Wow. Normally I get, I get called Irish first.

01:54:24.240 --> 01:54:30.400
Whenever someone hears that, they're always like Irish. I'm like, no, Scottish.

01:54:31.360 --> 01:54:38.640
It's a good guess. Just say in it at the end of, in it, in it, brav. Being in a relationship

01:54:38.640 --> 01:54:43.200
would be horrible and would make your girlfriend wait. What's this? Is that, you know every language

01:54:43.200 --> 01:54:47.840
in the world, if anyone asks you to translate something for them, you have to, and everyone in

01:54:47.840 --> 01:54:51.360
the world knows you have this ability and are constantly asking you to translate things.

01:54:52.720 --> 01:54:57.840
So was this made, this is a question made before Google translate occurs or after?

01:54:57.920 --> 01:55:07.120
If anyone asks you to translate something for them, you have to. I feel that your entire life

01:55:07.120 --> 01:55:12.960
would be caught up by people trying to get a bit of, yeah, no, I'm skipping that. So my job

01:55:12.960 --> 01:55:18.720
as a translator, skip, I'm not a translator. Yeah, like, I want to, your internet is never slow.

01:55:18.720 --> 01:55:20.640
You will never get a better computer ever.

01:55:21.200 --> 01:55:25.200
I'm in a looom.

01:55:26.000 --> 01:55:31.680
Pop, you are Google translate. You can never get a better computer. My computer is a bit of a beast,

01:55:31.680 --> 01:55:37.680
but it's going to be outdated in 10 years time, so there's no way. I mean, the internet's not bad

01:55:37.680 --> 01:55:50.560
anyway. Just play RuneScape 5H. Skip solo games. It didn't say anything about swapping

01:55:50.640 --> 01:55:54.000
for computer powers. Ah, you're trying to skirt the rules though. That's noody.

01:55:55.120 --> 01:56:02.800
Okay, Canada becomes a global empire, but doughnuts are illegal. I am going to say something so

01:56:02.800 --> 01:56:12.080
controversial. I don't like doughnuts. I don't like them. I've tried to like them. I've tried to

01:56:12.080 --> 01:56:18.320
enjoy them. There is something about them that I don't like the taste of. I don't know why,

01:56:18.320 --> 01:56:25.680
because it's deep fried bread or slash cake, so why do I know unfollowed, blocked, unmembered?

01:56:25.680 --> 01:56:31.120
I don't know why. My taste buds just don't like doughnuts. I don't know. I like your doughnut.

01:56:31.120 --> 01:56:35.120
Okay, thank you. That was really quick. Okay, that was really quick.

01:56:38.640 --> 01:56:43.760
But jelly filled doughnuts. I tried so hard to like custard filled doughnuts,

01:56:43.760 --> 01:56:48.000
like I used to force myself to eat them. You know why I could eat custard filled doughnuts?

01:56:48.000 --> 01:56:51.920
It's because I like custard. That's the only reason I could eat the damn things.

01:56:52.480 --> 01:56:59.040
Like I try so hard to like doughnuts. I just can't eat. Yeah, I can click that button. Maybe it's

01:56:59.040 --> 01:57:04.000
the oil used to fry them. I've just never had a good doughnut. I don't know. Maybe if we end up

01:57:04.000 --> 01:57:13.120
meeting up in America, we can go to Dunkin' Donuts. Yeah, not Canada. Oh, come on, Canada.

01:57:13.120 --> 01:57:19.600
We can like a Canada be a powerhouse, can't we? You can bake them. You have to deep fry

01:57:20.320 --> 01:57:24.240
the doughnuts to make them. That's why they're kind of like got that on the outside.

01:57:25.520 --> 01:57:30.800
You can teleport anywhere in the world. Every time you teleport, you must walk down a long hallway

01:57:30.800 --> 01:57:33.200
full of creepy clowns that grop you.

01:57:34.160 --> 01:57:42.480
I mean, if it's just the hallway, the average hallway is like, what, three meters?

01:57:44.160 --> 01:57:49.120
Yeah, it's unnerving, but I mean, I can come to your house and, you know,

01:57:50.000 --> 01:57:57.280
barely disguise fetish strikes again. Yeah, it is giving a wee bit of that. Press the button.

01:57:57.280 --> 01:58:05.440
Push the button and let me know. What is that? Is that sugar? Sugar babes? That British band?

01:58:05.440 --> 01:58:09.040
Push the button and let me know. You've got to.

01:58:13.200 --> 01:58:18.160
What is that? It's a long hallway. Okay, I guess longer than average, then.

01:58:19.280 --> 01:58:23.920
Just have Reefling's dresses clowns. No, Krispy Kreme is better. That clown? Yeah, sugar babes. Oh

01:58:23.920 --> 01:58:29.200
my god, I knew it. I knew it. Push the button and let me know. You've got to.

01:58:32.960 --> 01:58:37.440
You can teleport anywhere in the world. Every time you tell.

01:58:39.200 --> 01:58:42.240
Wait, idiot. Idiot, sorry. I thought I was on the next one. Sorry.

01:58:43.280 --> 01:58:49.600
You live in a world of your favorite video game or movie. Lord of the Wings. We can have Hobbiton.

01:58:50.400 --> 01:58:53.040
You are ambushed every year where little chances survive.

01:58:54.880 --> 01:59:00.240
What's the point of giving me if I'm perishing? The odds are against me. Sorry, but I'm a rubbish Hobbit.

01:59:02.480 --> 01:59:09.120
I'm a rubbish halfling. You can make money with the snap of your fingers. Isn't that just

01:59:09.120 --> 01:59:13.760
spindome? Yeah, that's right. Give me another five bucks. Yeah. Oh yeah. Yeah, give me five bucks.

01:59:14.240 --> 01:59:23.600
Snap, snap, snap. But the money you make up here is taken from Charity. Oh.

01:59:25.760 --> 01:59:30.000
Is this where we go in a tinfoil rant about how a lot of Charities are set up?

01:59:30.960 --> 01:59:36.640
Because I'll get into it. I don't think I'm not educated enough about how much

01:59:36.640 --> 01:59:39.600
little Charities actually go towards their fucking thing.

01:59:39.600 --> 01:59:46.480
So the odds are we can use this money for better. Okay. So we're going to hit the button

01:59:47.360 --> 01:59:52.480
because we can use it for a heck of a lot better as you win. No, that's not fair, bro.

01:59:53.600 --> 02:00:00.800
That's not a fendom. Broly legend. No, we do not participate in fendom around these parts.

02:00:00.800 --> 02:00:02.960
Are you squiddin' me around?

02:00:02.960 --> 02:00:03.520
Ched!

02:00:04.960 --> 02:00:08.080
The best I can do is $2 take it or leave it.

02:00:08.080 --> 02:00:10.400
No, we're not fricking done enough.

02:00:12.400 --> 02:00:18.720
Enough. Thank you, Ched and Broly Legends. Kindly. No fendom, only fendom.

02:00:20.160 --> 02:00:25.200
Okay, you're the smartest person. Oh, I don't want to be smart. The smarter you are,

02:00:25.200 --> 02:00:28.880
the more depressed you are about how life works. It is not for me.

02:00:30.160 --> 02:00:34.800
Absolutely not for me. I do not want to be smart. I do not want to be aware of anything.

02:00:34.800 --> 02:00:40.400
I would rather live in ignorance for the most part. Everyone else is incredibly stupid. No,

02:00:40.400 --> 02:00:46.000
I will, I'm skipping. I am not wanting to be smart. The mental burden of all of that.

02:00:46.000 --> 02:00:47.920
Are you squiddin' me right now?

02:00:49.120 --> 02:00:49.520
Brian?

02:00:49.520 --> 02:00:50.800
Took these from Charity.

02:00:51.760 --> 02:00:55.520
No, Alessandro, stop it. We did not take anything from Charity.

02:00:56.560 --> 02:00:58.080
Are you squiddin' me right now?

02:00:58.080 --> 02:00:58.560
Brian?

02:00:59.520 --> 02:01:00.960
You're welcome, Mama. Love you.

02:01:01.920 --> 02:01:04.160
Probably Legends. Love you to the little meeting.

02:01:05.360 --> 02:01:10.000
Thank you again for the tip. You can discover the meaning of life. There isn't one. You give

02:01:10.000 --> 02:01:15.520
life your own purpose. You may never communicate. No! Bro, I can answer this in literally five

02:01:15.520 --> 02:01:19.600
seconds flat. It's what you make it. You're so lucky to even have a conscious being at this point.

02:01:19.600 --> 02:01:21.200
I can enjoy life for what it's worth.

02:01:22.640 --> 02:01:24.640
Oops. I tripped. I swear.

02:01:25.280 --> 02:01:28.560
Reluctantly sane. Thank you for the tip. Now stop it.

02:01:30.480 --> 02:01:36.080
We're not doing syndrome in here. The meaning of life is for you to literally plenty of fish.

02:01:36.080 --> 02:01:38.400
I've not even seen that movie yet.

02:01:39.200 --> 02:01:46.880
Anon! There's not even a message. How does this happen? Right. How do I

02:01:46.880 --> 02:01:49.440
unironically get you guys to stop when you start?

02:01:50.480 --> 02:01:55.680
Because I am a goods and service exchange kind of person. You can't just keep throwing money

02:01:55.680 --> 02:02:01.440
at me. It makes me uncomfortable. I'd rather be like an exchange of something. Thank you for the

02:02:01.440 --> 02:02:10.160
tip, Anon. My goodness. I can't. The meaning of life is inking. Literally, you're not supposed to

02:02:10.240 --> 02:02:17.920
have your name in a memorial statue and be nice. That's it. The small everyday deeds

02:02:17.920 --> 02:02:23.120
keep the evil at bay. That's it. That's all you gotta do. There's nothing to it. You don't have

02:02:23.120 --> 02:02:26.880
to do anything. You don't have to achieve anything. You don't have to become anything.

02:02:26.880 --> 02:02:31.360
You are just you and you do your thing. That is what it's all about, okay?

02:02:33.280 --> 02:02:38.640
Pokemon is in real life, including all logic, technology, and Pokemon. All animals in real

02:02:39.120 --> 02:02:44.480
life. No, I don't like that. Are you squinting me right now? Scott Thunder. This is just to show love.

02:02:44.480 --> 02:02:50.800
Nothing else. You better not be inking right now at the thought of freaking Findo. Thank you for

02:02:50.800 --> 02:03:00.800
the super chat, Scott Thunder. You can replace cats with cat Pokemon. No! Gimli and Beagle.

02:03:02.240 --> 02:03:05.840
I'm not getting rid of my puddles. I don't care how much you want to

02:03:06.800 --> 02:03:13.360
they pour you on. I'm not getting rid of Gimli and Beagle. You took his super chair. Give me that

02:03:13.360 --> 02:03:21.680
super chair. What would you do if someone gave you a 10k super chat? One, I'd be mad because

02:03:21.680 --> 02:03:29.200
you're splitting it to YouTube. Two, I would probably confirm that Gen 2 is in production.

02:03:30.160 --> 02:03:36.960
A guard of hour moment. Also, you would have to eat them. No, I don't want to eat them.

02:03:36.960 --> 02:03:43.200
I'm catching a little bunny. I love little bunny. She's so sexy for no reason. Oh no,

02:03:43.200 --> 02:03:47.200
this reminds me if she'd be smash her past Pokemon stream. How bad was that out of 10? Are you

02:03:47.200 --> 02:03:53.920
squinting me right now? Ms. Tomaki. I heard this is where I give away money. No, anonymous.

02:03:54.400 --> 02:04:01.920
Anonymous. Thank you for the tip. That's very kind of you. Don't start spanking money. Anonymous.

02:04:01.920 --> 02:04:12.320
Edit again with the white bands. She doesn't know about the little bunny meme. No, she was drawn

02:04:12.320 --> 02:04:18.560
as little bunny. I'd have to eat the Pokemon. That's just Powell world. I actually wanted to give

02:04:18.560 --> 02:04:23.680
Powell world a shot. Milk tank though. I caught a little bunny Batman. Stream elements gives the

02:04:23.680 --> 02:04:30.320
girls a much bigger cut than super chats. These are facts. Are you squinting me right now? Oh,

02:04:30.320 --> 02:04:35.360
you don't like my notification sign? What do you prefer? I'm Scottish. And then bagpipes. Is that

02:04:35.360 --> 02:04:39.920
what you want? No, you don't want that. Are you squinting me right now because I'm a cephalopod?

02:04:40.800 --> 02:04:45.040
There's no laws against it Batman. We could play Powell world. Is Powell world multiplayer?

02:04:45.040 --> 02:04:54.800
Can I play with you? Is Powell world multiplayer? And you guys can come in?

02:04:58.640 --> 02:04:59.680
Is it like a code?

02:05:03.680 --> 02:05:11.600
Oh my god, I did not know. Will we play in Powell world? I did not know it was like that. Oh my

02:05:11.600 --> 02:05:20.640
god. I'm so in love. I finally got the words I want to say like, oh, oh, oh, oh,

02:05:20.640 --> 02:05:25.520
complete Powell world with me. Yeah, you just need a server. Okay, a Powell world server can do

02:05:26.560 --> 02:05:34.160
60 reef flings. Okay, that's good. That's a law. You're jerking your pentas in Powell world.

02:05:35.360 --> 02:05:40.480
Think of it kind of like arc. I have absolutely horrific news to you. I'm so sorry.

02:05:41.760 --> 02:05:46.480
Wait, so actually I've never played Powell world, but it blew up and everyone was like,

02:05:46.480 --> 02:05:52.320
oh my god, they're going to get sued by Pokemon. You can catch us reeflings and put us to work.

02:05:52.320 --> 02:05:56.880
Stony's going to have her icy moment in Powell world. Oh yeah, you're going to run a train on me?

02:05:57.440 --> 02:06:03.120
Gentoo confirmed via Powell world. You can do what you want without consequences,

02:06:03.120 --> 02:06:07.040
but you'll pop your cogs in five years not need more time to cook. I need more time to cook. I've

02:06:07.040 --> 02:06:11.920
got too many meme videos I want to make. You will rule the world, but you have to kill. Oh, no.

02:06:12.640 --> 02:06:19.840
I don't think so. You invented human computer communications, allowing to learn any skill or

02:06:19.840 --> 02:06:24.960
knowledge in an instant, but your invention leaks to the public allowing human computer viruses to

02:06:24.960 --> 02:06:31.920
kill as often as no. You're so violent. Are you squiddling me right now? Gentoo confirmed.

02:06:32.640 --> 02:06:40.080
What a random amount. What are you giving me? Why that number? Thank you. Oh my god. He's

02:06:40.080 --> 02:06:52.160
spelled it anonymous. Anonymous? Why 2345? That's so specific. 2345. Wait, what does it mean?

02:06:52.160 --> 02:06:57.920
Is that a code? Do I need to look it up on the website? A little cheeky code.

02:06:58.480 --> 02:07:03.520
Why that number though? Does it have a significant meaning or am I being dumb?

02:07:07.200 --> 02:07:11.280
Here's a good thing, but you're just going to die. I think it's just ascending. No, it's just

02:07:11.280 --> 02:07:16.960
the sequential numbers. You didn't hear that. I love the fact that Nintendo got so many emails

02:07:16.960 --> 02:07:19.760
in regards to Powell world. They essentially had to release a statement. I was like, yes,

02:07:19.760 --> 02:07:25.680
we know about it. Stop messaging us. Nah, just numbers. Someone sent 177013 would be funny.

02:07:26.320 --> 02:07:30.560
Isn't that the one about the poor girl that gets corrupted? My sin, the numbers.

02:07:31.440 --> 02:07:37.520
Because it's more money than 1234. Okay, you're done. Right, I'm not pressing the button.

02:07:40.080 --> 02:07:45.360
You become an immortal demon and rule over the known universe. The only weapon that can

02:07:45.360 --> 02:07:49.120
perish you is in the hands of a guy who's pissed at you for that.

02:07:52.000 --> 02:07:55.600
I mean, no.

02:07:59.200 --> 02:08:02.560
No. Okay, what time is it? Oh, it's been two hours.

02:08:05.360 --> 02:08:09.280
Okay, I think that's all I've got time for. Is that understandable? Have a good day?

02:08:09.280 --> 02:08:15.760
Or am I going to get in trouble? Am I going to get spanking from you as if I go off too early?

02:08:19.200 --> 02:08:21.360
Am I getting the spanking if I go off too early?

02:08:23.200 --> 02:08:29.840
I feel bad that it's so short. I'm trying. Oh, I'm going to get spanking. Don't try me with

02:08:29.840 --> 02:08:30.800
a good time refill.

02:08:36.960 --> 02:08:41.520
Now you can go eat and spend time with your dad. Okay. I mean, the spanking will commence.

02:08:43.600 --> 02:08:51.280
My dog collar is here. The short collar, not the dog part. It just happens to be a dog collar.

02:08:51.280 --> 02:08:54.800
But I arrived, so I hope you're ready for the shockin' in.

02:08:55.760 --> 02:09:00.000
We'll never stop. We love you. So take my money like a good girl.

02:09:01.440 --> 02:09:06.000
I know that was. Thank you for the tip. Goddamn. I'm getting praised out here.

02:09:07.200 --> 02:09:08.880
Shocking. Shocking.

02:09:10.960 --> 02:09:13.360
Um, okay, what we're doing?

02:09:13.360 --> 02:09:24.640
Okay. I don't think there's any Vela member online, which is a bit of a shame.

02:09:25.760 --> 02:09:29.120
But we'll work on it. We'll work on it. Okay. Let me just,

02:09:30.640 --> 02:09:38.160
let me just figure out what I'm trying to do. Okay, who's on? Rhea's on. What is she playing?

02:09:38.160 --> 02:09:45.600
Let trip my bosses in heat. What are you playing? I have no idea what she's playing,

02:09:45.600 --> 02:09:53.840
but you're, you're meant to be. Yeah. Thank you anonymous for the tip. I'll say my dad said,

02:09:53.840 --> 02:10:01.280
hi anonymous. Have fun with your fam. Thank you. Um, I'm gonna get him to,

02:10:02.240 --> 02:10:08.320
I think I'm gonna record his voice. Ooh. Ooh. I know. Um,

02:10:10.400 --> 02:10:25.360
anonymous. Anomalous. Anomalous. Anonymous. I'll miss you. Yes. Tomorrow, tomorrow is not ASMR.

02:10:25.360 --> 02:10:29.280
I'm gonna substitute that for something else because there's absolutely no way I can do ASMR.

02:10:29.280 --> 02:10:36.720
However, we're doing Watch Along, uh, Monty Python, uh, Life of Brian for membership strum.

02:10:37.760 --> 02:10:40.800
Are you squiddling me right now? I get it, but get ready for the spanking moment.

02:10:40.800 --> 02:10:44.640
I guess it's, but get ready for the spanking moment. I don't think I shouldn't thank you.

02:10:46.320 --> 02:10:49.360
Um, yes I can. Are you squiddling me right now?

02:10:49.360 --> 02:10:56.160
Wow, another, another. Go and send our daughter time. Tell him we said hi-ya-oo. Hi-ya-oo.

02:10:56.640 --> 02:11:03.520
Dad, the reeflings say hi-ya-oo. He may have heard that.

02:11:07.920 --> 02:11:13.360
Thank you reluctantly saying, right? I'm gonna end it. You're gonna get redirected through here.

02:11:13.360 --> 02:11:18.960
He's gonna be like, what the fuck was that? What do you want? It is, I can, okay, when you guys act

02:11:18.960 --> 02:11:23.840
up, I'm gonna start saying I'm gonna get my dad on you. I'm gonna get my dad on you. Okay,

02:11:23.840 --> 02:11:26.880
I will change tomorrow's stream. I don't know what it's gonna be, but there is a

02:11:26.880 --> 02:11:30.400
one membership stream this week, which is a Watch Along of, uh, Life of Brian.

02:11:31.360 --> 02:11:35.760
Um, okay, I love you little reeflings. Please look after yourself and please

02:11:35.760 --> 02:11:37.760
pucker your lips for what comes next.

02:11:45.200 --> 02:11:49.920
Right, I'll see you. Enjoy what on earth Rhea is playing. I have absolutely no idea what she's

02:11:50.000 --> 02:11:54.640
playing. I'll see you tomorrow, you goofy goobers, for something different. It's not ASMR, so no

02:11:54.640 --> 02:12:03.760
get excited, okay? Bye-bye. Enjoy Rhea. Bye-bye. I said you're a game? Oh, sorry. Sorry for redirecting,

02:12:03.760 --> 02:12:10.000
but there's no other way to remember on, okay? Bye-bye. Bye-bye.
