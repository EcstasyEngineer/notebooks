which I can't talk about, I'm allowed to talk about it now okay, Viallure officially
have partnered with gamersupps, eepie, all the girls' descriptions will be updated and
they'll be tweets made very shortly, but Viallure are officially partnered with gamersupps

descriptions will get updated soon, there will be tweets made very shortly, what is
that?
it is an energy drinks company, but you can also get non-caffeinated beverages as well,
but yeah it's another income source for the girlies and I'm so happy, but yeah that was
my big news that was kind of like lurking around in the background, I got a new short
that got uploaded as well, I'm just reading some of the comments on it, strongy is neurodivergent
if that's true base, at one point screams I'm freaking normal, now you can get a taste
of mummy, I mean after the last run it was obvious you're the final gamer, that's why
they wanted a piece of me, blame the tism, yep blame the tism, but yes I have a new short
if you haven't seen it yet, it's about how the background musics are all about sonic
heroes which actually came in really good timing because we literally just played sonic
heroes, sonic heroes, I will definitely do an endurance, it's some comment, oh I thought
this is about how the veiler company was being made up of lootubers was the exposing, I didn't
know it was going to be about background music plagiarising, my guys not that serious, it's
not called plagiarism, it's called influence, have you heard of influence before? I've
approved the comment anyway but what the fuck it's not actually really exposing the fucking
company what the fuck, I also had an offline tip so thank you spidey for the offline tip,
they put tess for some reason, I don't know why, Mr Beast collab when? Mr, Mr, Mr Beast,
oh but speaking of things that are coming up soon, now this one's just coming up for
me and it was you coming up for me, hey let's go we got an update, check it out, I'm poignant

together, we're so cute, so we've got this version that's coming along very quickly,
the artist is working so hard and diligently, that's version one which is like a full, that's
like the line art if you will, and then we've got Colored in Tommy, Colored in Tommy me,
I'm so cute, but we're gonna have like an x-ray shot so I'm about to be able to do the see-through
view of you and my tum tum and then I have some cursed ASMR to record, I actually came up with a
new meme ASMR and it's absolutely horrifying, wait I might be able to find it in my notes because
I wrote it down, Scottish e-girl Miaw is like a cat for money ASMR, I know that sounds really weird
out of context, I have a picture to go with it okay, and it's basically like you're my sugar daddy
but I'm Scottish, so you're like Miaw for me and I'm like I'm not gonna Miaw for you and it's like
do you need the money and I'm like I guess, I'll mention like the steam summer sales which are

pop from the same devs, yes, I think honey pop is the puzzle one but I didn't want to play the puzzle

cause I certainly would not have if I didn't read that comment, viral momello, are you squidding me
right now, Scottish gilf let's go, heck yeah, okay let's play it, so this game came out and
everyone was in a freaking chokehold over it, I'm not really sure I'd watch you even if I were one,
okay, what's the point of living without watching mommy play childhood games, I was watching this
then streamer do, are you squidding me right now, like a media share thing, prosdino, ever since
violers debut, I've slept less than, oh well, we might be on the same page, I'm gonna be honest
leafling, but I also feel a lot more energized so it cancels it out, thanks mommy, hi you're welcome,
I had a big sleep, I slept for like seven hours after stream and then I've just slept for, I want
to say five hours there, so I'm gonna slurp my tea, hold on, oh no I've just accepted, the stream's
gonna be, they're limited ads, it's fine, yearly cameo placer, I'd be really down for it, like I
just, I'll eat cameo, I'm sorry, it's like such a good game, you can wrap it up, or wrap it up,
seven hours is a big sleep, well it is in consideration that I had two hours the previous day,
are you squidding me right now, oh soul insert, coming out with the lore, actually I remember
honeycam studio came out with negative reception, because of the different art style and lack of
scenes, I'd buy veal or something, I considered it, I considered producing a vn at one point,
because they're a lot cheaper than the average game, it might officially be the first game I'd
produce, I would not base it after the veal or girls just because you never know what will happen,
you know I might do something catastrophic, although I did say to the girls if I ever do
anything bad take me around back and shoot me, do not ever let me live long enough to become the bad
guy, and they were all giggling, but I don't think they realised how serious that was, I was like
take me out back and shoot me, do not let me be the bad guy, okay, do not ever let me act like
you know the very thing I swore to destroy, don't let me be great, as I said we've got
gamersups codes, our updates will all be updated soon, there'll be graphics added to stream soon,
and there'll be tweets about it as well, they are so kind to getting that organised,
but as always the girls get to keep 100% of what they earned through that code,
veal or don't touch it, go straight to their accounts, they will attest to this because
I'm about to have to get them to sort out their accounts, what are you playing, don't look okay,
don't look, recon crusader, love you goddess, love you replaying,
but yes the girls have gamersups accounts, if you wanted to activate the code right now,
just use the code and then their name, if you literally mersey, we everyone got their first
name, so strony, mersey, azura, emmy, ac, mersey, asad mersey, you're gonna miss him,
ac, emmy, azura, shibi, mersey, strony, oh I'll go everyone, okay, I was like hold on a minute
something, I don't know, sassapress, one month ago I fell in love with you and I predict that for
the foreseeable future I shall be in love with you, here's to many more months mommy, I just added
that myself as a thank you for falling in love, get plapped, get plapped, get plapped,
could you imagine an azura waifu cup, unfortunately I'm not sure how gamersups works,
I will ask permission to see if I'm allowed to discuss certain things but at this moment in time,
I'm a good girl, gamersups pog, so if you ever wanted to try gamersups, I'm actually gonna make a
handcam ASMR video about them because they are very kind and they're willing to send out PR packages
so I get to ASMR muck about with their products, so that'll be fun, zero thank you for the one
month, love you mommy, congrats on everything on this one month, can't wait to spend more time with
you, let's go! Just so you know, aside from the main theme, all four teams from Sonic Heroes
have a theme song, we can for Team Sonic, this machine for Team Dark, follow me for Team Rose
and Team Chaotix for Team Chaotix, listen to them all, they're bangers, oh yeah that took me by
surprise when we were playing against Team Rose, my voice is absolutely correct otherwise so thank
you tiny spainy for the tip, yeah I got so surprised, I started hearing, I was like lyrics
and songs in this game, I wonder what mommy's flavor would be, probably pish, no no one's gonna
buy pish, um we will play every team so listen to everything, yes I will ask, um, gamersups what
kind of insider stuff I can mention because it's nothing to do with me so for once I can't even
be transparent, something behavior, hey thank you zero, I don't actually think I said your name when
I said that, peeler flavor, I mean, I mean, Chaotix theme is the banger, I see an enemy would have
a pish, right okay, user done, let me finish this team, we'll get into this game, um so this is
Honey Cam Studios, this is a, uh, simulator strategy building game, I am so bad at identifying
game types, I'm not even kidding, I am absolutely rotten at it, it's fucking mean, I have absolutely
no idea how to categorize games, I mean you guys were literally telling me what, oh I've already
forgotten the name, the type roguelike and roguelike are like two different things, it's a tycoon
a management sim, okay, okay, yeah, for some reason I need to do like a video essay on
categorizations of gaming's because I'm just absolutely awful, gamer slob sex vealer is the
only way to pheromone max taken out, this is literally a game of you running a virtual version of
Exactly, is this game about us? Okay, now I remember when this game had a choke
haul on everyone, choke hold on everyone, but I never played it because I was very young when
it came out and I was still at the mercy of like asking my mum to buy me games, smile, because steam
games and I never really had the money for it and just call it drinking, eat me, I'm in
the strong need to put me in a choke hold on, honeycam falls under the sim, simulation
and management categories not to be confused, stimulation, get it, yep, yeah you get it, okay,
I'm sure you want to start a new fair, let's go, yeah, there I am,
hold on, let me pop this

I accidentally made it not full screen, oh for fuck's sake, how did I keep doing this,
hold on this is terrible, how did I make it big, help me make it big, roof laying please,
how did I make it big again, I accidentally minimized it but it's like locked and it won't make me
let it go big, all enter, no, what are you doing video game, can I stretch it without it being
stretched, okay, that's just gonna have to do this, oh stop it, I mean let's keep it 100 here,
this is the closest you're gonna, I will edit the sentence once we get in here,
so I'll put the music down but I'll put the voices up, I mean let's keep it 100 here,
this is the closest we're gonna get to female interaction right, whoa stereo and man's just
entered the fucking game and we're getting insulted, hold on a minute, hello, why are we being
insulted, help me make it big, if you put it in a choke hold it'll become big, roasting speed run,

Moved from the pacific to get away from her strict family and lives by the by her rules. She acts shy, but she knows what she's doing
Pardon me. I just burped
I'm gonna get Ico
And then I'm gonna shove all of the stuff on her
Uh
How do I uh, how do I put items on her? Oh, no, they can only hold one item
How do I put an item on you?
Hold on
Wait, what was her addiction?
Addicted to drinks. Okay. Wait, hold on. Hold on. I've got give me
Okay, so she's not addicted to drinking but she'll smoke a little bit
Uh, okay. Okay. If we can do this the wine box would be perfect in your book
Wait, honey
Cam has the girls from honey tuna. Take Ico the uchi Asian from the game. Ico is a dub
Sarah has a huge huge fan count. Yes, I can do that
Uh, let's
Talent
Does he need talent or am I being crazy? Wait, what did you
What is uh, forgotten what this does Aaron's point cash will
Aaron's more fans per oh, I think it's better to do the cash
Yeah, we're gonna need some money
Yes
Go you're too stressed out. Of course you are. That's completely normal because you can't be a robot
That's fine
Right, you do not make as much as she she makes 34 per
Session if you will
Right, what's the next upgrade so receive five plus cash
Oh, these are 500 though
I mean it implies that this one productivity and accounting are that you are in debt. You still need to pay them to drive
Okay, okay, I'm working on it. I'm working on it. How do I get more smokes? She's just going to singy
Okay
I am trying so hard level. Okay, so it puts them up
52 cash though
Oh every time she pops in
Yeah, that other one does not really make me much money. I wish I had displayed their names. What's your name?
What's your name? Nikki Nikki with the blue hair
Tiffany is free. I may send her to get a new item
Because the girls that don't get stressed don't actually have any bonus items on them
Not too bad. Nikki's too stressed out. That's okay. You're allowed to be stressed
Nikki's gonna need your pops and
He's a cake
Uh, Keanu's too stressed out as well
Oh
I am gonna try and
Just max out money because we're about to have to pay at midnight. We're at 8 30. So I'm playing it safe
We will just do the midnight thing
Sure, I'm just gonna go all out of money for her
Almost yeah, because there's currently unless we speed this up a bit
Oh, and I can get them back and then there can be more than one
Oh, please get to work minus theory again
Fans earned from a photo shoot increase
Wait, these are all full shit related
Should I just do nicotine patch? No
Uh
Sure, let's get this one for no particular reason at all. Hey, Tiffany for no particular reason at all. Here you go
Oh
Wow
Oh, Nikki just does not make me any money. She really doesn't
We're at maximum capacity. Oh god, this game's harder than I thought. Am I gonna lose?
For no particular reason, right? Let's just get her more fans then
Are you gonna be stressed out?
Uh, I feel like yeah, but
What do I kind of want to get the one we're more oh, it's 500 bucks right do 100 bucks investment
as soon as we can
because we're struggling
Nikki you are not going to be doing shows you do not make the same kind of money maximum capacity wait wait until she gets out
You go make fans you do that
This is getting rough
Right 100 bucks. We're almost there
I hope the rest of the girls are not watching this right now
Me and August like that's it. Everyone do this do this. Get out. Get out. Get out. Get out
Uh good, can you like
Get slightly better at anything. I don't mean to be nasty. Nikki, but you are struggling right now
To do anything
Okay, we've got 100 bucks
Accounting receive extra cash
That's two minutes when we rush. So we're gonna do that one next because apparently we're like rushing through the entire day by accident
57 cash, okay, that's good. You can go get a new item to give to the girls
Oh wait, I accidentally put
The boutique all right
I'm not a girl, but I will get out
Strongly working everyone to the bone. I don't know what I'm supposed to do. Am I supposed to manage their stress?
I assume I could just put them all in at the same time
All right, we'll put her to rest
Nikki's now level two
Oh, you're too stressed. That's fine
Uh
You're going straight back in misses 57
Although we can get another girl if we really want us
Receive
Streaming quality, uh-huh girls can carry two items. Yes
That's very good because you need a nicotine patch
Yes
Yes, that's what I wanted to do right
Okay, they're both relaxing so I'll skip time on them relaxing because we need to farm money like no
Do we prepare for a new person coming in with nicotine patch and stuff I think we do
I think we just prepare for a new girl coming in with the smoking and drink situation
You're gonna have to go make some cash because you're doing terrible
Strongly now needs a purple coat
I walk with like a pimp. Was it a walk like a
a real og
I don't know what I'm doing. Can you guys make some money? Oh my gosh, please make some money. I am dying
No sweat. We're about to go in the red again
Why am I so bad? I think they need to get more fans, maybe
Maybe
Yeah, sure you did fine. Oh, we are not gonna make the payroll
335 bucks
I don't know if we can invest in another girl
Oh
My gosh, wait, why is this game so hard? I'm doing something wrong. There's something I'm not picking up on
What am I not picking up on earning an extra 10 bucks? That's fine
Stream call a cash earned by 500. Right. Is that what we're going for?
Uh
Needs more
Overlap every time you send them to the adult store their price goes stop. Is that real?
Ico is expensive time to time is going by too fast as well
Should we do the 100 bucks then?
This is hard
I'm trying
right, let's do
Well, she's about to finish right go again
Oh
Yes, go right. She makes 500. Why do you make 57 bucks?
Because you've got talent times two
But then that puts her base price up. I need to give everyone the piggy bank
I'll do it
The price depends on style and talent not many have I think training the girls is more important than money
Think about how well we are allowed to if the girls had zero experience
Honestly
If I 15 fans
But there's no overlap
Uh maxipum capacity
I don't know
Does shove everyone into the bit club
I'm trying to get more fans in the categories with that other girl and then if we hire someone
That has like same fan base that would probably help out a lot
She's already pretty talented, I don't know. I'm probably gonna regret putting her in there, but
I
Know you you have hardly the output
God they're inside the studio for so long. I'm definitely missing something 57 cash
I cause less than 30 fans does she? Oh
If we're still in the red by midnight, it's over getting them trained is pretty important
Is it fans are getting them trained like this?
I don't know
I'm trying
Okay, listen
Sure, if you say so right 200 fans
I thought this was gonna be a chill game because literally I looked I was gonna play idol manager
She is she gonna end up making the most money
I was gonna end up playing idol manager, but you guys were like that game's actually super duper hard. Don't do that
So I've not done it
I feel like I'm doing something terribly wrong
Girls can carry a third item for 2.5
We'll do the elapsed time one against my better judgment, but she's about to be stressed out
It's too expensive for your current setup
Well, I guess you're just gonna get more fans
Okay, so Ico hardly has any fans
So
Do you want to go get some?
Okay, we made it to 100 bucks. So we're gonna invest. I know we're gonna go in the red
but
I'm needing help
With this zoom in thing. I need the time to go slower
Should have gone for she was way cheaper
She makes 52 cash now, okay, it is I need to send them into
The thing need to get more fans. That's fine. I can deal with that
Yes, go get more fans
Everyone go get more fans. We're trying we're trying out here. Okay
I know we're gonna go into the negative. We were scaling too early
Okay, everyone go get fans go get more fans go
Okay, you're too stressed out. That's fine
And then everyone's getting sent away to make money
Come on come on come on come on
All right, go make money. Okay. She makes 164 now
That was the problem. We needed fans. Okay
That was the problem. I didn't optimize
You're too stressed out. That's perfectly fine
Okay, everyone's getting sent to this little photo shoot everyone's getting sent to the photo shoot
I'm learning we're getting there into the content mates. Everyone do a publicity stunt right now
purposely get banned go on a two-day
Suspension and then come back and then everyone will go nuts for you. Okay, everyone do something out wildly against to us
But not to against to us
I don't make myself clear
Okay, I think I made myself clear everyone get fans. Okay, you hardly get fans when I send you away though
Oh my god a hundred and are you too stressed? Okay, that's understandable. Have a nice day
Oh my god. Okay. We're learning. We're learning
Right you make 81 sure get me 81 the now
Something yeah, someone do something controversial. That's it. Do what damper did get that
Okay, okay, okay, I'm listening to make it easy for you. I put together the promo section, you know the drill
Open up that window for me
This is a list of all the sites. Oh, we can just straight up buy fans. Okay
Bedsitter's bed post. Okay, you're done
Soriety secrets hot chocolate love stop
Each site caters to a specific fetish. So all the new fans gain from that is hilarious. Oh, that's so good
Two so we don't have to wait around for fans to trickle in
This is so good for my way. If you invest in advertising, we'll have more promo opportunities every day. Okay
Okay, I
I am understanding
I'm comprehending right everyone go make money the now
Because we're gonna buy promo
Yes, we're gonna buy promo if it's free and I don't have to send them. Is this dealer? It absolutely is
I'm trying so hard to hit all the categories. Okay. We've got lollipop on the go. We've got penta
We've got
Chocolate right you do 81. Sure. Why not?
right
We have we've got another one for
Teen
Okay
Okay, okay, okay. I'm learning. I'm learning right go get more fans
Right promo. No, wait. I've still not made the money. Wait, hold on. Hold on
Okay, I'm starting to slightly get it right. We don't have any fetish for hot chocolate lover
Do we have the girls that cater to those? Yes, Tiffany is a
Oh, she's also banal
Okay, I'm learning I'm learning
We're at 45 bucks though
Ha we're at 45 bucks already
Hmm should I go all out on money at the moment?
What would be the next one 250 receive 10 plus cash
Four ads will be available. Sure. I'll put it into ad space because if it gets me if it skips the part where they have to go
Oh, you're too stressed. Sorry
If it's oh my god, she makes 180 though
Okay, I think we'll go all out on buying ads
And just try and get the money we are going to go into the negative but that's okay
We working on it there we go what we're looking at negative. Oh see only negative 79 today. Okay. Okay. We're getting there
What does promo look like today?
uh big booty
And glasses are the only two that we can utilize right now
So we have our objective
Done with that
Okay, let's invest like that
Glasses yes, we have two with glasses actually
Okay, okay
so
glasses and that one
And that's all we can do today
For investment wise that way
Sure, we'll get some fancy
Easy peasy, huh? Oh you're too stressed out. Sorry. Sorry
Oh, we are like you doing it. I will take your whole stock of ico
We might need to invest in the chub and chocolate for the new gen moment. Okay. Okay. I hear you. I hear you
Uh, we could maybe do
You're too stressed out. That's fine. You're allowed to be stressed out
What are we looking at for all locations will all click? No, it's fine. Um
500
Cash earned is increased by 50 percent. Okay, we're gonna go all out on that for now
I think that's the best idea at this point in time
But we are starting to get a lovely
Gross
We are starting to do it. It looks like advertisements are way to go but we will invest in a
Okay, let's hurry up with the spaddy so someone else can get put in as well
And
And then
For making money it's fans modified by their talent value time to make them go into the club
Okay, they have multipliers
Mmm
Nice capacity. I'm just telling her like continually get more fans
Because she's upgrading glasses, which I assume cascades on Ico
I don't really tell her to stream that much
We'll try it. We'll try it. We'll try it. It is going to put up our base price for the girls, but they are doing pretty good right now
Okay, there we go
investment go down
by the cam
Community you receive three plus
What next is the game maybe accounting is next and then capacity and then I will get a new girl because we're at the point
Where not everyone is fitting inside
Sure, why not?
200 bucks 200 bucks two nine seven
Two two eight nine you should get more toys
You would say that wouldn't be a little refling
Oh, we are starting to cascade what Ico though. We're at 300 bucks already. Is there anything we can get?
We can all right, okay, okay, we're doing it. We're doing it. We're doing it. We're doing it. We're getting there
It just took me a hot second. Okay
I'm just very dumb
Now I'm gonna put something on nicky because we keep pushing her
I don't know how little or
How much we're gonna go under for debt for the payroll, but we're trying
That's the main thing
Are we even gonna go into debt today 700 wait why 700s?
Why 700
Why 700
If the girls get those fans has a high talent she'd get more for Ico
Yeah, I was gonna put something on nicky because nicky's getting glasses
For her right now, which is really good
Oh my god, this really is a strategy game
I thought it was gonna be the easy peasy strategy, but nah, they're going for it
I'll see if I can get a comp. Oh, you're too stressed. That's fine. You're allowed to be stressed. Right. No, not nicotine
Girls habits improve. She'll only demand half as much pay. Uh, that's really funny
No
All these are temporary
The piggy bank seems all right though
Oh
Right hold on books
Kiana's actually charging a wee bit
You can calm down here and that's what's up
Wait, hold on. Is it girls?
How do I put a piggy bank on you?
I've already forgotten how to put the piggy bank on hold on
You calm down. Thanks. Stop charging me so much. I know Ico doesn't have a free slot yet
As well as subscriber pillow. Did they get paid while relaxing? What a kind card
Every ever they stream cost you and you're running some of those girls into the ground
Oh, she makes 194. Does she make more than the other girl?
I guess because she's making all the fans in her
Category
Oh, she only makes 140 now. She's the weak link
I
Don't want to level her up. You know what go and get another toy
What's in my inventory I forgot
Keep forgetting right actually already have a wine box and nicotine patch if I wanted someone new
I think I need piggy bank for Ico
I think I need piggy bank for Ico
Wow, that's rough. Ico is killing us right now
If I can get a piggy bank, I'll have to invest in
Oh, there's actually a few things we could invest in here
We don't have the others yet
2.5 for a third item
Ouch
You are the weakest link goodbye
Yeah, because she isn't leveling up
I know but if I level them up they cost even more per hour
That's currently the problem I'm facing
1.9
I don't want to level them up, but I think I'm gonna have to
Go get some more fans while you're at it
302 cash though
I like the little heels sound
Yeah, she's gone up to 14 you're too stressed. That's fine. That's fine. Everyone's too stressed. Everyone's allowed to be stressed. Okay
Orange stale while shopping in half the time
Sorry, but it's just cat ears. I don't think cat ears are very I don't think that counts
um
Well, we've not done that on someone so
Who's getting in uh
sports
I'll just shovel on here. Okay
Ah
That maybe wasn't the best idea but hey ho
Can you switch items? Yes, I assume so
Okay, she's just gone out to 194. So do we farm fans again?
All right, we don't have that invest what five girls all locations
I think four girls in a building and then we'll do the staff one
I say that as if I'm not running us into the ground right now. Go get more fans
Or maybe I should I should invest in the more fans thing
I don't know what to do
I'll invest in the more fans thing it will put us in debt, which is fine
But
Um
Imagine if we just hoarded piggy banks and gave them all to the girls. I'm needing to shove one on ickel
But I'm like hardly getting the cash
Kiana's stress free but where am I she only makes four
It's six new things right. I know this is bad, but if we get more fans
It'll be worth more and yes, I know we're about to go into insane debt
But that's my choice to be a dumb dumb and puts on debt again
How much in the negative? Okay 200
That's not bad. We took down 200 in the payroll
From that piggy bank manoeuvre
A little bit. How much are you owing? I all pair day
Oh, it doesn't really say per day
Ha ha ha
You're too stressed out. That's okay. That's just very terrible timing
Good we're getting 200 per show. That's good
Uh, you're getting close to 200 per show which again, it's good
What how much do you get per show though?
300 per show don't mind if I do
Don't mind if I do
Sure, uh, we don't have fit do we?
No
Oh, we do have fit okay promo fit go right Tiffany should have more fans
Depends on their work hours
No, no one will be getting a sign-on bonus until they've done their work. Did I make myself clear?
I think I'll go pick up another item because some of the girls don't hold anything
Probably gonna regret it, but go
One two five she makes more than the others
Right are your weakest link. Yeah, you are right go get us a new item
And then Tiffany you hurry up so we can put you on the site. Okay
Go. Okay. Yeah, she makes way more
Okay, okay, we're keen to get in there
I'm like did I just hoard money so I can put three items on the girls
Ico has the stream to make up the cost. See if I can get piggy bank
It's getting thrown on to Ico because she is just
stupendously
I recommend putting them to work 24 hours per day because every moment they're not working is useless stop
I wish I could make a joke right now, but that's hilarious
I'll let you cook again
You did fantastic. You're too stressed out though, which is fine. Um
Receive 20 plus cash each time you collect from the studio. There can be four girls in a building. I'm wondering if that's the best thing to do
Hold on let me cook but in a bad way
I'm gonna invest do that one
Oh wait, that didn't help
Hold on hold on piggy bank. Yes. Okay. We're gonna go all out. We're gonna go all out on
Getting the third item we give that to Ico then we're laughing to the bank because she just cost so much at this point in time
So that's done. Yeah, but we're getting 300 cash for what she does. Okay. We're going all out
We're going all out promo. We don't have these yet. So there's not really a point just yet and doing it
But we are going to try and get 2.5
thousand dollars
I'm enjoying this game so far. Sorry. I like it. I like these kind of funny asking right. What is the negative we're putting?
We can recover. Okay. We can rebuild. I repeat we can rebuild. What is promo today?
I think we have a flat chest. Who's flat Ico? No, you're not
We don't have a flat chest
But we do have a piggy bank so
We can do the s word
Hmm
You're too stressed out. Of course you're too stressed out
Okay, okay, we're going all out. We're gonna get this third item. We're gonna give it to Ico so she can stop draining our supply
Bad luck on ads today. Yes. I'm just gonna go all out on money. I'm gonna save every penny. I think we can do it
I think we can do it as soon as Ico gets that piggy bank. We're laughing because it hardly cost us a runner then
Come on
Come on. Why are these shows taking so long?
I feel like you'd be done after the two-hour mark. I'd be like, oh, I'm exhausted. Come on. Wrap it up everyone. Wrap it up
Give it a shot. Oh, we got a thousand right. We're at a thousand. We just need to do that again a week
Oh, you're too stressed out. Of course you are
Too stressed out right go make some money
Right. Well, we need a thousand more dollars and we're done and we're not at noon yet. So I think we can do it
Come on everyone wait hurry up and relax
Mm-hmm says the endurance streamer. Yeah, they must be rappers
Are they streamed for 12 hours a day? Okay, I'd be exhausted. I don't know how these girls aren't stressed out the wazoo
Okay, go again go again
You can do it right. Hurry up. Hurry up and finish. Yes. Go make some fans
And then go make 300 bucks go
Go go go make cash make cash. We need 500 more
Come on. We need 500 more
You would be exhausted
Where are you?
But there's something to do with some of the de-stressor options being
and
They must be yapers. Yeah, they probably yap for like three hours and like right. Let's get down to business
Oh, come on. We're so close to getting that upgrade
Yes, we're almost there. Come on
Go go go
Right, we did it. We did it. We did it. We did it. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. I know this is against what I want, but
there
We've got enough
I would not we're really just shy. It's fine though. It's fine
Right piggy bank time piggy bank time for real for real god. That was 800. Are you fucking serious?
Aiko you cost so much you cost so much money. Aiko you are running us into the ground. Do I make myself clear?
So is she be streamed? Hey
Come on. Her yap is the best though
I want to go get cool. You did fantastic, but you're too stressed rubbish
She makes 300 now. Yeah, definitely need to get them more fans. That's how we're getting like any money
Right one more batch at the camp studio and then
Then we can upgrade to three items. Aiko gets the piggy bank. We can invest in another girl
We can start investing in the promos as well. What are we looking at to do?
Decent the cost are pretty penny though
You keep working the girls to death and everyone but Aiko makes like 75 cents a fan at best. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay
Let me cook though. Let me cook slowly. Aiko high quality high cost. Yes
Yes, go make money
Okay invest
item books, okay
you
Stop charging me a ridiculous amount of money
We should just get 18 fans. That's six hours or I can just get money
You're too stressed out. You're allowed to be stressed out
Go make money
Right, so can I now get a fifth girl? I can and four girls to our building
And aesthetics
Training and aesthetics don't do anything
Building and then we'll get new staff about that and then I'll start sending them to the shops to get
Items to get more fans in certain categories wink wink
They took way too long to pick that now her corpus isn't gonna be in debt so it was something
Okay, I can do it. I know what I'm doing wink wink. I do not know what I'm doing
Yes, you're too stressed out. You're allowed to be it's okay
Go make some more fans. I think is oh someone needs to go right go recruit someone
And then we'll invest in some
We've got stuff for that so go invest in that I guess
Invest in a staff spot
All locations will all collect I don't really these kind of seem a bit arbitrary like we don't need it
5,000 a thousand
Maybe a thousand in product abuse seems best now
Second talent really makes 75 cent training correction is needed
I'm trying I'm trying
Oh Nikki has a huge tag. Sorry I keep forgetting
She makes 300 now
I
Don't know if I'm gonna regret that I probably am
Let's get the new girl in I don't know what the result is gonna be but let's get the new girl in
Nadia frequently well, it doesn't matter what they do to de-stress
Sira gets fans though fan count 178
And we do have some crossover with this one, I think sira
Sira's an unbearable weeaboo. I think it's sira that wins. Look at the fan count that she comes with
And we already have the stuff to put on her
uh Nadia
Is a self-described
Russian goddess who used to provide sadistic
Okay, I remember Lidalia
Erin's one cash for each fan she has and she has 66
But if I level up sira, I want to say sira. What was that noise?
Uh-huh
Okay
Um
The premium pass but it only takes an hour what's the downside
Nasty dudes are walking around with
What's like without a little risk though am I right? They can get
You know what they can get a few dudes
Okay, we're gonna level her up go make some money at the moment
And
Okay
Oh my gosh, not real
Oh, she really is a weeb completely right go get some more fans I guess
Oh my gosh, okay. I need to put nicotine
She really goes arigato. Oh
It's a bit cringe for me hen. I have to admit
Ken is now level two talent goods. I'm glad
It goes well
Okay, there we go, but she costs more
All right, what are we looking at today?
That'll be worth it. That's worth it. That's worth the that is worth it as well. Actually
I think we'll do a full investment from
Need her for gen two right now
I don't know. I saw shebe's tweet on her all if you didn't see it. Don't worry. Um
But she doesn't she's unsure what she wants her
Finalized, um
Her 2.0 idea to be
All right, let's get some promo first because from promo is just more fans, which is good. So that's exactly what we're
wanting
Cheeky bit. Oh, I've just closed off the game. Oh, I almost just ruined that run there because I don't know if it auto saves or not
Okay, let's get right into it. We'll do the promo for it. Wait. Actually, we might be able to do it now
chubby Asian glasses and then that other word wink wink
Okay, and then we'll do investments. It all saves each day. Thank goodness because I accidentally clicked also
That could have gone terribly wrong
Okay
You want 300 you're too stressed out, which is perfectly fine. Don't worry about it. You get 300 that's perfectly fine
You did you did sugoi desune
You did so sugoi desune. Don't worry about it
Right invest
I don't want another girl at this point in time
Um elapsed three minutes each time you click
So what all locations no, that's rubbish
It might be hardware or advertisement each fan. Okay. Hmm. That might be worth the you get a receive five fans each time you collect
Wait, no, that's rubbish
It's web servers hardware advertising
Capacity is five grand
Up to six girls can be employed at once
It's either five grand for web servers hardware advertising is 1.5 and maybe advertising
It's the way to do it productivity is important. Am I be am I misunderstanding?
Hmm elapsed three minutes each time you click to rush an activity
Yeah, I'm I'm gonna just take on what you guys say
I'm not gonna doubt for a second that you guys are completely correct in what's going on. Okay
Um
Because this is confusing. I'm sure there's real strats that I could have but I'm being very dumb
Um
Right if you're all done, can we get you more fans? Maybe
No, I'd rather everyone just work right now
You're too stressed out. That's fine
She really said completely. I love her. Sorry. What's your name again?
Sarah. Konnichiwa senpai
It's a boy. There's an a
How'd I do?
Uh, right everyone makes some motherhood cash, right?
Invest
Not six girls at the moment
Maybe that adds promo what we're looking at
I love this game. This is so good fame

What's too stressed out? That's fine. You're allowed to be stressed out. It's only human nature. I'm only human
Buildings can have eight girls in them. Yeah, I think I'm gonna do that because that's hilarious eight key
Nine key not bad

The more fans the better
Keep telling you to take it easy. I will eventually well I go jumped from five thousand to eight thousand per go
Hold on get some more fans
Everyone's going to the photo shoot because what the heck? Why was that so much?
How much do you make you too stressed out? What do you she makes fans every time she goes so
Payroll processed. I didn't go in the negative. Let's go
You're too stressed out
Mmm
Right, let's make if you're not at ten thousand per show then you're getting shoved into the photo studio

So any work in the girls like
Ten thousand right you're allowed to go you're too stressed. What are you you're ten thousand you're allowed to go

Together last upgrade
If you could choose a design any of the girls have for a future den
I think I want to make she be gay to
She seems to have an interest in it and if she doesn't want to submit for that
So, um, if the girls sign on for another year, uh, we
Vealer offer them a free alternative outfit
Um, they just tell us what they want and we'll get it concepted and if they're happy with it
We pay for it and all that type thing
Um, so if she picks something else that isn't gairu, I'd love to offer gairu if she signed on for another year because
It goes that
Oh, you're too stressed out completely
Um
It come
Sorry, I'm trying to
Like all play this game, but it's not working in my head
Time to grind. Yes
um, I'm currently
Hyper focused on Azura getting moved out because I think once she moves out she will have so much more time
to be able to
Really hone her craft because uh, Azura's got it. She just needs enabled and I hope her donathan has come
It's on the 21st of august
So don't be shy to you know, keep a little little five dollars back. That would be very kind of you even
Small things add up very quickly. So, uh, please do if you are
um
Written for the girls. Um, I would absolutely love to see Azura's donathan go off the wazoo
Um
You make absolutely nothing go get some fans
It's too stressed. That's fine
Um, she did the gairu classmate roleplay. Yes, we we redirected inter and her per head was coming off her neck
I do not know how to use the booth stuff
so, um
What was that half a million that better be the last one because that's insane
Azura the goat for real for real. Yes. Um
Like she's interested in doing youtube roleplays like just to put up stuff for free like more content basically
But due to our living situation, I mean, you know where it's like it's busy houses are busy. That's just how it is. Um
So we're gonna try and get her moved up
Dullahan gairu bunny stop. That's actually quite funny
Not in a mean way though
You just like plop it on to be honest over the top layer

Like I used to watch a lot of let's play you beat it
Not be tubers youtubers at the time and everyone was like, oh my god
This game's so outrageous and I was like look how far we as a society have come
Because it's really not that outrageous and all honesty
I feel like we're
Oh my god, we're so desensitized as a site
Oh, would someone please think of society at large
I should have shopping levels them up. So the girls are gonna cost a little bit more doing this but
At the end of the day

It was the first time I've ever done anything like that the fact that it's even still gonna come out as a christmas miracle
Um, uh, it's very likely delayed until august. Um
It was my fault because of the way I did the art commission
So
I am not like it's absolutely nothing to do with the
Development team or anything it I am the problem
I'm the problem. I promise you I'm the problem

Please
Yep, I'm going
Okay, we're at 50k subscribers for the girls
At one month in we're at 50k subscribers. Not bad at all
Very good very good
Sure
Promo
I did not have enough money for this
50k that's insane 50k for one k
Are you too stressed?
And
I don't think so
She private it think because she came on hinge and the human was scared to get in a strike
She's not on a warning though Azura
Emmy and myself are on a warning
So she would actually receive a warning unless she's not told me she's got a warning. She even
Do you have a warning?
Too stressed out have a spuddy
Too stressed out have a spuddy
47 grand she makes here
We'll just get a hundred key fans and then we'll send Lillian to the motel and we're done
Um, I got a warning for an audio of me
Actually, it was because I had the audacity to breathe in the mic. I uploaded an audio called clapping without my hands and
YouTube time stamped where I went wrong
What got the warning for and it was when I breathed in the ear of the mic
It wasn't the actual content of the
the
Video if you will
It was because I breathed in the mic
And the time stamped it to when I was in the mic like hey
Yeah, so I might actually be cheeky and upload it again and cut it out at the end section
Um, because that's what the problem was
Please kill me
Okay promo
Just buy it all
50 69 subscribers at all according to plan
It's funny that the actual clapping was okay. I know it's redonkulous 51,000
Holy moly 51,000
58,000
Oh
Yeah, you have 20 key fans
100 fans per photo shoot. I don't know if that's worth it though. I think I'm better just farming
Advertisements
Uh, no, leave it to me if you say so
If you say so over 9,000 on youtube something
Um, like I have I have two shorts
I want to upload but I'm too scared to do it until that warning's gone
But the warning goes away august like 20th, so it's gonna be takes so long
Because one of them is about ear licking but there's no breathing in it
And I think it looks okay if there's no breathing
Yep, I'm going
Okay promo, uh, just buy anything
Everyone get to work and yeah august I think august
12th or something is when it goes away. I can't remember but it's in august
It's a bit harsh for a warning. Yeah in last 98 well a warning isn't a strike
So it's actually more preferred to get a warning because if I got a strike it meant I couldn't stream for an entire week
Um, which that would have that would have upset me far more than
anything else
Can't wait for the orwell stream tinfoil hat. Oh, yeah pure tinfoil hat. I'm not even kidding
Um, it is a bit of a reading simulator, but don't worry. I'll do the reading
I'll do all of that jazz so you don't have to think
um
I played it many a year ago now
So I don't actually and I never fit it. I never got the correct ending in the game
So we're gonna try and get it together. You guys might be able to figure it out before I can
Um
But yes
Anything else more work 51 000. Let's go
I will promo uh chubby
A week without money mommy. I don't want to a imagine a week without money money
I said it the wrong way, but I know what I was trying to say. Okay. Me
At least just rest up
They probably don't want mode schools to the make I think you're looking
I don't know if I think is breathing with ear licking at the moment. Um
It's rather strange what's going on. Um
Rather strange indeed. I wish they would just come out and be like hey, you can't do this anymore
But youtube's was like ASMR is like the top 10 searches
and
So obviously they probably don't want to be like publicly coming out with like oh we
Have fun it by the way
Just need to find the new ASMR mail. Well, I've ordered the denpa
Uh
Mould shall we call it? If you know what I'm saying denpa did a very egregious audio
Okay, which made me laugh more so
Are we at a thousand? Hey everyone's at a thousand! It was a thousand for for the diamond, right?
Oh
The chill bro, you got the ace. Yes, I got the ace
Um, I also am getting another prop
Um for a stream and also the 10 key stream
I think it was 100k
What is a denpa denpa is a fellow vtuber
Um, and I collabed with her on the alien collab that's on my channel
Two out of six isolure confirmed. Yeah, I sorry, but um, he's actually so smart. I'm legit copy and pasting her strats
Denpa cooked with that one
At denpa literally
I'm sorry. I suppose youtube doesn't have more competitors for some of their weird occurrences
So it's been tried. What's her name?
Uh, is it it's not frivolous folks. What's that other asmr?
uh
Gibi
Asmr
Attempted it and it didn't work
It
Because
You need people you can't have free users on it, but it's still like didn't work at the end of the day, which is such a shame
How much oh, but you get so many fans for it though
There was a youtube for asmr. I wish
They realized if they had ads
um
If they had asmr friendly ads like people would be more likely to run ads like at this point in time
YouTube force ads at the start and end of videos
It never used to be like that, but now it is like that which is a shame
100k reach. Okay. Is that it's done. Is that what the diamond was?
Shubby flat chested put all my stonks in there
It's also expensive af to host. Yeah, literally
I don't know if uh another site could be right raised up like that like youtube have a monopoly
Oh
It is a very I love listening to soft asmr playlist and then being blasted by a trucker
Yeah, like I don't know how on earth they come out and be like, yeah asmr is in the top 10 searches
But haven't cracked that if they had acceptable
levels of
You are really lagging behind why?
Oh, she doesn't have a third thing to bounce off of
To make another youtube you would need a time machine. Yeah, like the competition is so hard like
I think rumble is probably the only
It's not even a competitor. Oh, no, I just put no, I didn't want you in the hotel
No, it's supposed to be her. Right. I'm putting her in the hotel now
Lilithin Lilithin is going in the hotel. Uh
We will we're gonna let you have some ciggies. Okay, you're gonna need ciggies after this, but take that way. Okay
So now she's got a piggy bank
Uh, she needs that. Okay, and then this too
Man that meet and greets going wild for her. Oh, she's in the photo shoot right now
I love it. Okay
We've never done this before wink wink. We're we're gonna send her. I guess if you a little you utilize the sleazy motel
You could potentially oh, she just said we say
Okay, go 60k in one hour. Yep. I'm going. Oh, yeah, that definitely seems worth it
Whoa, we're running a little low on cigarettes and booze. We should really take care of that ASAP
A lot of these cam girls like to smoke and drink. We haven't unlocked this part of this tutorial
A girl who smokes and drinks a lot isn't going to get us stressed out from doing activities
But if you run out of cigs or drinks, she's gonna start to get real stressed out real quick
Okay, so if it looks like we're running low you need to have somebody run to the store and stock up
This is the liquor store. Oh my gosh. Wait
We didn't oh
I must have like I must have remembered from the fuck I used to watch that you need to maintain this
That is hilarious
So it takes only 10 cigarettes what?
Per run
That's gonna get out of hand so quickly and then actual well, we made a million though
Yeah, I'm going
That's crazy
Oh fantastic needs to get full efficiency liquor IV drip. So we're still in this tutorial. No, we did it. We did it
Oh, there's a pie chart. Oh tattoos is winning
Chubby
Latina's the smallest
Oh, it like tells you who's like doing that as well. Oh, okay. Okay. Wait, so
Chubby fit
Uh, that one
Okay
Yeah, you can definitely optimize the heck out of this
Okay. Yeah, I'm starting to understand goth solo carry. I'm telling you goth is winning. He's still having this though
Well, I think we did it
Uh, I think we're we're done. So
We've gotten what we can total fan count like I don't think we need to do anything
That was fantastic. I've really enjoyed that game
Hold on. Let me let me pop my background music on and then mute the game. So it's not annoying
Uh, right. Let's see if sheepsters is live so I can redirect into her
Please don't be in a membership stream. Please don't be in a membership stream
Uh, right customization redirect
And she's playing elden ring. Let's go. I can redirect into her
Is she for a cd? No, she's put shields on her chest. That is hilarious
Uh, the goth will say something like I don't want to take the lead and letting the other girls be ahead of the agency
Hold on a minute. Is it gonna be a goth girlfriend of vealer too?
Uh, vealer to the vealer ring. That is hilarious. Let me write that down
It only took you roughly 10 more days to reach the 100k if you didn't want to probably get the gold medal
No goth girl need a slim girlfriend too. Well next week we're drawing your suggestions on ms paint
So I hope you're ready for that craziness
um
That was such a fun game. Okay. So tomorrow is orwell
And then the day after is the vealer collab. I've got balutroll
But that's actually getting swapped out for another stream because I am watching yumi plus's concert
That's right. Yumi plus have a concert and I'm getting paid and I get to watch a concert
I'd rather have goth than slime
Well, I'm gonna be a goth. I think my alt's probably gonna goth up by me
