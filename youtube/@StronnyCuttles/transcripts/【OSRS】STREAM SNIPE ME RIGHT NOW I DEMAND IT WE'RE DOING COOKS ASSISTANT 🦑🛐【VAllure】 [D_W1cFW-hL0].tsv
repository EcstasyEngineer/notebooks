0	28600	Bruh.
28600	36800	Everything is breaking right now. Holy crap. Everything has broken.
36800	40440	I can't even hear in-game sound. I'm pretty sure I'm supposed to be here in the music
40440	50120	right now. Hold on. I'm so sorry. Everything broke from yesterday.
50120	59640	My headset isn't registering sound at all. I knew it wasn't. You're lying to me!
59640	68600	Ugh, the scuff isn't- Oh here we go.
68600	76860	I just heard the test of some music. Okay. I can now hear the title of music? Yes, I can.
76860	82660	And you can hear it too. I don't know how loud it's going to be though. Oh my god. Anything
82660	88420	that can break will. I didn't change a single thing from yesterday's drum.
88420	95900	Ugh. I apologize for being late, little refunds. That was horrific. I haven't even been able
95900	99020	to watch yesterday's words. I know the next stream is starting. However, I meant to keep
99020	105660	up with your strawney. That's the fun part. I have endless stamina.
106620	113940	See? Those details come really good later on. Right. I don't- I need to- I made- I'll tell
113940	120740	you what world we're in. Right now I'm entering world 424. But I- I want tutorial island.
120740	125860	So please don't worry. What was that first song? It was called music makes you lose control.
125860	132500	Music makes you lose control. Let's go. Please don't worry if you've not actually got your
132860	138620	character outside. Good ol' Lummi Castle, Lumbridge Castle. I've not even done the tutorial
138620	144380	part. I do- I'm playing with a plugin called Runelight. But we're just going through tutorial
144380	152780	island super quick. I'm not- Oh no, I just liked it a brand new. Oh, we're doing an
152780	166460	in-depth in tutorial island then. Ah. Ah. I've actually been smart and I've prepared
166460	172460	a whole meal. It was absolutely chaos getting- I was trying to get Runelight to work on screen
172460	177460	and I was trying to cook fricking my- well, technically my breakfast, but I call it dinner.
178140	182220	And I actually have like the world's saddest fricking rose- I think it's called like
182220	191540	rosemary sauce when you have it with shrimp. And- ah. So, I do have membership. As isn't
191540	195140	the finalised world, please, I've not even got through the tutorial. Right, let me just
195140	200460	skip through this fricking tutorial. Ah, my phone's in the way. Oh my god, no, I can't
200460	207060	skip this. This is going to take so long. Oh my- yes, we'll talk to the survival specialist.
207060	211460	Look, that's what I'm eating right now. I- I'm ironically eating that right now. I'm
211460	217060	good. Wait a minute, this game's based on real life. How cool is that? We're going fishing.
217060	220660	Would you fish me up? Huh? Huh? But anyway, good morning, good evening, good afternoon.
220660	230340	I apologize, it's been fricking chaos. Thank you. And no way. Thank you for the tip, Virginia.
230340	235420	There's no way. Literally. Oh, ace of cullin' snow bears in as well. Thank you for the tip.
235420	241700	I'm about to munch on- I've got baked pate, aw. Right, and then I've got shrimp, and then
241700	246260	I've got a rose-ass aw, so I've not made it correctly because I didn't fricking squeeze
246260	253980	the water out of the prawns. Hi, ready? Hi, ready? Hi, acey and snowberry readers. But
253980	258340	if you put all those words together, it becomes ready. Are you squidding me right now?
258740	263780	Strony, you're eating marshmallows last night inspired me to try to write something
263780	268780	to make your heart flutter because I think it's adorable. Are you going to read more
268780	273860	tonight? I can definitely read more. Thank you very much, Grimbo, for the tip. Yeah, I
273860	279420	can definitely read more. Oh, I'm sorry to- I'm trying to eat and eat and wait and do
279420	283020	everything all at once. Hi, we're playing RuneScape, an old-school RuneScape. We're going
283020	287980	to play multiplayer and do quests together. I am called Scottlefish because I totally
288020	294260	did not steal that from a roofling. Thank you very much. But yeah, we're going to do
294260	300580	good. I am not- I'm going to move to a free world, but if you want to make a new account,
300580	304740	we are going to do the free quests like Cook's Assistant and that, where the heck am I supposed
304740	308780	to go? I don't know. I'm not paying attention. Now that you have logged, it's time to light
308780	314740	fire. Oh, okay. Pardon me. Pardon me. Excuse me. I'm going to take a bite. Ah. Hi, Stromboni.
314740	321380	I've got a nickname. I'm not sure I know that. See? So, I've got this plug-in called RuneLight
321380	325500	and it's really good. I think it's really good. If the game needs to be louder, please
325500	330380	do tell me. I actually think it does need to be louder. So, I'm like, screaming over
330380	336180	all the things. What next? Moving on. Well done. Moving on. Moving on. Moving on. I've
336180	341700	completely forgotten how the tutorial goes because it's been so long. I'm going to take
341700	347860	another bite of my food. But yeah, if you want to join in, don't worry. You can literally
347860	353020	make a character right now and be faster than me. I will tell you what world we're on. We're
353020	360180	all going to meet outside of Lumbridge Castle. So, whenever what world we'll get, we will
360180	366820	do a Chicky Lumbridge Castle. Yeah. And then we'll take it one by one and we'll quest.
367740	372740	We're going to start with Cook's assistant because obviously this is a bit squished.
372740	379460	And my goal is to get 99 cooking live. Like, not in this one stream, okay? Not in this
379460	384740	one stream. Whoa, whoa, whoa. I don't know how to do that. Although, I think if fletching,
384740	390260	if you have like a ton of GP, you can actually get 99 fletching in one day or something like
390260	395780	that. I can't remember. I think it's fletching. You can kind of smurf it, smurf it with cheese
395780	401300	a bit. All in one stream, crazy. No, no, stop getting hype. It's not happening in one stream.
402100	407540	Okay, quest journal. Yep, we are going to do the free quest first as best as we can.
408420	411700	And then we might move on to membership quest, but I do want to give
411700	417460	Refling the chance to come hang at Lummi Castle, the glum castle. Any, any lumbers? Any hashtag
418420	425060	I'm taking a little bit. It's super expensive for a member. Yeah, it's really expensive actually
425060	432500	to do the thing. But membership in this game is so expensive. I remember I asked my mum
434260	441460	to buy me membership when I was a wane. And it was like cheap as anything. And she never got me
441460	445060	out because she didn't understand what the game was. And she's like, why do you need it? Why do
445620	453460	I need it? I'm like, mum, I want membership. Ryan. Stay awake from last stream. Let's see if I can
453460	463060	make it to the ASMR stream. No way. Are you, you must have been so many iron reaper that I managed
463060	467700	to get an eight hour sleep after that stream. I don't know how long the endurance stream,
468420	473140	it was like three quid the last time I got it. Honestly, I remember like begging my mum. I was like,
473140	478260	mum, I want, I want membership. But she never understood my games. And then that's when I go
478260	486180	to dad. See, dad, dad knew, dad knew what was going on. He knew the games. I'm like, dad, what
486180	493300	we're doing? I'm not talking, I'm right. Hello, my name is Scottlefish. I still live. I usually
493300	498020	only sleep four or five. Are you guys all insomniacs? I got four hours. Good enough for me. Bro, that's
498020	504500	not healthy. Honestly, I felt, I woke up and I felt sick today. And I was like, is that because
506180	511300	you, you will be told to equip items later. You don't have access to the interface for equipment items.
511300	517540	Oh, okay. One more. Thank you. Right, shovel on note. Okay. Are you squidding me right now? Ryan.
518180	524340	Strani is going all weekend for the 99 cooking. She never burns out. She only burns
524980	530180	I actually quite like that. Thank you, Tim. Shuttle. I think Tim shuttles the way I'm supposed
530180	535140	to say it because there's no way it's like any other way. Right, let's go combat interface. Right.
535140	540420	Yes, yes, yes, yes. Oh, beautiful. Let's stab. Give him a little stabby stab. Stab them rats.
541700	545300	All right, hold on. Hold on. Nope. Too far. Too far. Inbought, inbought. I,
546420	550340	whenever I watch RuneScape streamers, they're always like super zoomed in. They're like, oh,
550340	554260	yeah, look at that. And I'm like, bro, I need to be able to see what I'm looking at. Like,
554260	560980	I can see the health bar. I can see everything. I'm not saying anything up before anyone complains.
562660	569540	Chat sleep. Chat needs to rest as much as me. I've got absolutely no sleep at all. Are you
569540	575860	all insomniacs? You're all literally all holding on for the ASMR stream. I'm getting my nails done
576820	582180	after the ASMR stream. So hope you're ready. Wait, what am I supposed to do? Oh, no, wait,
582180	586500	sorry. I'm supposed to do range weaponry. Can I do it from through the gate? Oh, I can.
587540	592420	Didn't realize old school room shape. Oh, didn't realize old school RuneScape membership is 89.
593620	601060	No, bro. The inflation has hands. I'm sorry, but all these things being like, oh, no, cost 11.
601060	604820	Well, you're not employing your pay. You're not paying your employees more. So I don't know why we're
604820	612900	pretending the cost of living is a thing for these companies. I said also. You're doing your nails
612900	620500	for the sweet eating stream. Yeah. How else are you gonna, you know, to my hands? You need to be
620500	625620	able to imagine my hand wrapped around. And that's terrible. We're just started. I would do a lot of
625620	633540	food filming. Oh my God, I'm rich. We're rich. I've got 25 coins. Are you squeezing me right now?
634500	639220	Brian. You guys have been somnia said the Scottish madness streaming assassins creed
639220	645300	for a combined 20 hours within the span of 36 hours. That's because I had problems sleeping.
645300	652740	Thank you for the tip, Tharya. Oh my God. Right. So you can do voting like if you're like hardcore.
652740	656820	Well, it's not really actually, but it's actually quite quick to get that. Oh, I've just skipped
656820	663300	past the bit that tells you. Oh, what should we vote on? Should fire light a new level 77 demon
663940	671780	bro. I have not. Whoa. These are like the same question, but different. I have not.
671780	677060	I have not played enough runescape. I'm like the basic runescape for it. Okay. Before you think
677060	683700	I'm going to start getting prayer pots out, I'm going to start a what is it called like pk in.
683700	689940	No, I'm not pk in. I'm not doing that. I'm not happening. No, I'm called Scottish. I've got
689940	695380	membership 30 days left. Oh, no, you can't see it because I'm a big ass. Hey, I'm grabbing the view.
696820	702500	What world? Okay. Worlds can hold 2000 members. Okay. We're very lucky, but I don't think there's
702500	708580	2000 recently available to stream snip. So the good thing, oh God, it's probably a bit too heavy.
709140	713220	Please don't show my email and password. That would kind of suck. But then again, let's just throw
714180	720580	this on the way to victory to victory to victory. I'm on the way to victory. So into the church,
720580	730340	I go. Hello, Mr. Hello, Mr. Brace. Any bracers was pking player killing. It's when you attack
730340	735940	players and you sell the goods that they drop basically. But before anyone thinks I'm going
735940	742580	to turn into a pk. Yeah, good luck, mate. That's what happens. I'm doing this tutorial right now.
744180	749460	I'm going to eat my food outside a lumbridge so everyone can get a chance to group up if you
749460	753620	want to start on a new count of Hingo questing together. So please don't panic. If you think,
753620	758820	like, oh, no, I'm not going to have enough time to join in, you absolutely do. I am going to
760100	766500	make it so I eat my foodies. I've got a cola and two bottles of water with me.
767460	773220	Um, as for those of you interested is if this is a and
780260	783140	Oh, where the heck am I supposed to go? It's not blinking anything.
785380	789060	Grabbing the boo. You will be shown how to cast spells when you get there. Just talk to the
789060	795140	magic and assume you can hear them. Oh, of course it pops up. What are we doing? I'll hop on.
795860	799060	We're going to just do basic questing because I've started a fresh account
799620	806980	and we're going to try and get 99 Kooten. However, open up your final menu. Ah, am I done?
807860	812340	Okay, not yet. We're about to teleport to Lummi and then I'll pick a free to play server.
813620	815780	And oh my god, I'm casting the chicken.
818340	822420	You wouldn't cast the chicken, would you? Would you? Who goes there?
822900	826340	Everyone has someone you trust to lure into the world.
827540	833380	Can I? I'm so sorry, but I'm going to confess my biggest sin and you guys honestly aren't ready
833380	840020	for it. I used to be double in money and take people's money. The biggest amount I ever took
840020	847060	was 100 K gold and then I stopped. I don't know how I didn't get banned. I think because I did it
847060	856500	in such low increments. Send me to the mainland. I was so sorry. I used to be the one at the
856500	862180	Grand Exchange. I was like a little kid because what happened was I got freaking scammed. He's
862180	868980	got a fish. Come over here, adventurer John. I got scammed and then I realized, wait, I can just
868980	875380	scam other people to get my money back. Doubling gold, doubling gold. And I'm like, I got all the
875380	881620	money I lost back. It's time. Officers, it's her. Literally, I was like a little nine-year-old hustler.
882980	887860	Like, oh, it's terrible. So if you ever got done at the Grand Exchange because you were a silly,
887860	894100	silly McGee, guess what? It was probably me. We're going to hang out at this fountain at
894100	900020	Lummi Castle right here. We're going to hang out at the little fountain. I am going to Swap World.
900020	904580	Wait, why is it flashing? It might be flashing. Right, what world are we going to go to?
905780	916420	I'll make it a free-to-play world. Whoa. Oh, wait, wait, wait. I think World Shifter's up here.
916420	924180	Okay, um, free-to-play trade. No, it's got 900 people in it already. Do we want free-to-play trade?
925140	932100	There's 900 people in it. Jagex is watching you now. They better not be. I'm in trouble.
932100	937460	We're going to hang out at Lumbridge Castle for until I've finished my dinner and I'm trying to
937460	943940	eat it on my breakfast. What world do we want? Free-to-play is good. Right, we'll just do the
943940	950500	classic free-to-play trade-free world 301. There's 900 folk in it, so we've got all the room in the
950500	957940	world. Take me, are you sure you wish to go to World 301? Yes, sir. Let's cycle.
962900	967620	Okay, I don't know where the heck the reef ones are, so we'll come a little over to the fountain.
970100	976180	Oh no, what are they use? I don't know. We might need to, I don't know, I think publish out.
976980	982020	I don't want, are these reeflings in game? Wait, wait, wait, we're going to go over to the tree
982020	990340	to make sure these are reeflings. Holy crap, are they? Brian! Good evening, Strony and reeflings,
990340	996100	have fun on the RuneScape grind. Evening Alessandro, thank you for the tip. Oh my god, they're reeflings!
996980	1002020	Oh my god, who are you? Oh, you're looking at, oh my god, wait, you guys are actual, some of
1002020	1008820	your actual players though. Oh, why are you so high level? Oh, oh, someone's called Tiny Cuttles,
1008820	1015780	that's funny. Wait, you guys are like actual, I missed one, that was such a good name. Oh my god,
1015780	1022020	just yummy. Hello, hello. Oh my god, you guys are like actual skillers and stuff.
1023700	1029460	Good morning, reeflings, they're saying, oh, that's crazy. Strony's surprised to chat our gamers.
1029460	1033860	I don't, but I didn't know if you guys were going, oh my god, you stole my drip,
1033860	1041140	you look like me. Oh, you guys, you get stood on. I see a Strony. You guys are like so high level,
1041140	1046660	that's amazing. You guys should probably teach me how to play the game. Unfortunately, we can't,
1046660	1054020	what is that? Why is he standing like that? What does it mean? Am I to rate him like a pony?
1054100	1062820	Oh, the guy's got the magma cape. I've never done the magma cape before. I have a stupid snowflake
1062820	1070420	account, so I won't join. What does that mean? I have a snowflake account. Steals her legs,
1070420	1076660	snowflake by the way. What does that mean? Oh my god, look at your fit, your fit's so unique.
1076660	1084260	You're holding a puppy, and you've got like little things going on on you. Right, a lot of
1084260	1094500	your like, over leveled like heck, what is this in his hand? Is that me in his hand? Oh, why is
1094500	1104020	your name that? Oh no, why would you rename yourself? Oh no. Check or treat, let me type.
1104660	1112340	Treat. I don't think I get, we want to see what you got, Sans. Shows what you got was to eat my
1112340	1118420	dinner. Where did he go? Wait, did he just disappear because I looked down for one second?
1118420	1122420	It says you guys want to trade me, but I don't think I can trade because I'm a new account.
1123460	1128100	I don't think it works. I think I need to go quest and to like unlock trade if you guys
1128420	1133540	want to give me anything. Is it in the stream to treat? Yeah, like I don't think you guys can
1133540	1143060	trade me anything. So don't worry, we're gonna go quest them. RIP, yeah. Wait, I'm getting the fish.
1143060	1149220	There's so many replays. Hello replays. Thank you everyone that can join. Hey, yo,
1149220	1159220	we're deforestation out here. Oh, they leveled up. Let's go. Okay. Trick it is, geez. Yeah, look,
1159220	1165220	accept trade. I don't think you can trade because I'm a new, new, new account. What? Are you giving me
1166900	1172740	a rope and a fish? Are you telling me? Are you doing that? Should you be tweeting? No way,
1172740	1177060	you could trade that. No way, I have a freaking rope in my inventory right now.
1179700	1184740	Wait, can you only give me like World 301? Yeah, this world is full sad. Why?
1186500	1192420	Oh, the world is full? Okay, wait, wait, hold on. Right, we're gonna move to,
1193380	1199380	we're not doing, I don't know what these are. The regular bought items can't be traded. Okay,
1199380	1202980	we're learning. Right, the world is full, so we're gonna go to an emptier one.
1203700	1207860	Everyone get ready. High risk world. Yeah, no, thanks. Have a bow.
1210180	1212340	Is there like a really easy one we can get inside?
1213940	1219460	Clan Wars? I don't know. Do we get grouped on? Are we technically a clan? No.
1223220	1226420	These are just dead Oz servers, apparently. Are these American?
1227380	1235380	380, someone says 380. Hold on, 380, 380. Right, World 380. And we're going to Brit Bungland.
1236020	1242180	Right, let's go 380. World 380. Wait, I'm double clicking. Let me go. 380.
1243620	1246980	Grand exchanges limited to until you do quests or play for a while. Yeah.
1248260	1254980	Now you have, now you have a fish. You're canonically strong. Okay, okay. Oh, look at everything.
1256980	1262820	Okay, World 380. How do you dance? Oh my God, it's been so long. How do you dance? I want to dance too.
1267700	1272340	I can dance. I'm sure I can dance. Hold on. Hey, let's go. Hey, grind. Oh, you know,
1273380	1278580	we'll dance. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, man. Look at that. Look at that. Look at that. What, what, what?
1278980	1283220	Oh, I'm, I'm stunning on them. I'm stunning on them. Look at them dance. Whoa, what the,
1283940	1288980	what in the pivot axis was that? That was awful. Don't ever do that again. Right, we're clapping.
1292660	1298420	Okay, now that's honestly grand exchanges limited to. That's not a clan. That's an army. Oh, yeah.
1298420	1303220	We'll be, we'll be do the refland clan and we'll go PK and like other clans or something. As if I
1303220	1309700	know how the combat works. This, this only world where the text matters is PvP, high risk, total and
1309700	1317300	demo. Right, are we ready to do the first official quest or I say that as if I've even hardly eaten
1317300	1324420	any of my dinner. Hold on. I'm trying to eat, but I'm such a blabbermouth. Honestly, I can't stop.
1325060	1329300	I'm glad the refunds aren't stacking in the one space. I strongly can appreciate them each. Yeah.
1330100	1337460	Hmm. I was still, I'm convinced that guy wants me to write them because he's like a horse, literally.
1341220	1346580	I'm so cute. Still got people doing tutorial. Yeah. Don't worry if you're still doing tutorial island.
1346580	1351380	I'm going to inhale my dinner really quickly. I'm going to try my best. What is that noise?
1351940	1359860	You're all making noises. I'm driving the booze. I'm still trying to log in.
1363140	1369060	You're not giving people time to do the tutorial. Only the players play some of their games.
1369060	1374660	How many are there? Oh my god. Oh, that's just an NBC hand. Oh, someone just leveled up.
1375700	1377860	Look at her high level you guys are.
1378660	1380900	I literally got the pepper, the frog over there.
1382820	1387060	I love mommy. Oh my god.
1392260	1395540	You guys are like actual gamers. Oh my god. It's much better than me.
1395540	1398900	I'm like scared to play the game and I'm like, you guys are all going to show me out.
1400580	1405540	Quality players determined by their agility and rune crafting level. Yeah. Yeah. No one likes
1405540	1410580	rune crafting. You're not selling it here. Get your propagandas useless out of here because you're
1410580	1417700	not rune crafting is the worst. Unless you literally have an entire army behind you to help.
1423380	1426340	At the end of the stream, you'll be that high level. I think not.
1427300	1434820	Yeah. Agility 89. You're really good at going in a circle then.
1434820	1443940	Jeez. My brother was a Rinscape essence slaver for years. Do you pay to like carry the thing?
1444500	1448900	Just don't please tell me. Banks are for squares. Are you an iron man?
1449860	1455300	Oh, so there's different types of players you can be. If you're iron man,
1455300	1459060	it means you don't have access to bank or something like that.
1460340	1463780	Guardians of the Rift is experience. It's awesome experience.
1465140	1470340	So will this be a 28 hour marathon? No, no, I don't think it's a marathon. I said yesterday,
1470340	1474260	I thought it was a marathon, but I woke up and I don't actually feel that well today.
1474260	1477700	I can't believe it. I can't believe streaming for 12 hours making me feel a bit wonky,
1477700	1482500	but I don't know why because essentially I would sit at the PC and work on like
1482500	1486580	Eden for like ASMR or something like that. But why is it when a streamer feels sick?
1486580	1489780	Like it doesn't make sense. Feel weekend stream height, honestly.
1491220	1498180	Free cuttlefish mustache right here. That's awful. Oh, how did you...
1499780	1506180	What? Are you just cuttlefish right in front of us? I didn't know Rinscape had emotes like this.
1507700	1510900	More active for streaming. Maybe because you did it three times this week.
1510900	1514980	Me? Isn't every strong stream technically a marathon, honestly?
1514980	1519780	Damn, how does one become an essence run slave? That's good money for that, I worry.
1519780	1522900	The members emotes go hard. Strong party. Heck yeah.
1523700	1530980	There's so many reflings. The servers are like who on earth are all these people? D-Refling.
1532820	1537300	I'll read out your name if it's refling related, but I'll try not to accidentally say anything.
1537300	1542020	Who is leveling up there? Freakin... I can hear someone leveling up, but it's always going...
1544180	1550500	Hello? Jack the Ripper's coming to get us lads we're done for. Maybe it was your screaming
1550500	1556900	yesterday, bro. I was so annoyed. I listened back. I didn't realise how angry I got. Like I got angry.
1561460	1565220	It's a scale cape or more? Oh my god, he's got the fishing scale cape.
1567540	1574820	Oh, je comprends, je comprends, wee wee. What is this freaking UFO over here? What is that?
1574820	1581620	Oh, is that prey? Is that questing? You've done all quests. Oh, you've got all the jelly.
1582820	1589060	Oh my god. Wait, what's the cooking one? Does anyone have 99 cookies? What's the cooking of more?
1589060	1590180	I can't wait to get it.
1590580	1597780	Oh, look at us all. Well, bing-ching-ing, d'enjouement, bing-ching-ing.
1599140	1605700	How do I change servers? I'm on the runelight, so it's plug-in, so it's up here,
1605700	1615620	but if you're not on the runelight plug-in, it's down the bottom somewhere. Smile.
1615620	1623140	It's on the cog, I think. I have two baked potatoes. I've not even finished the first one,
1623140	1629540	and it's freaking totey. Like it's so small. I'm trying so I can't eat and talk and be entertained
1629540	1636020	at the same time. Quest cape, quest cape. Ah. Max cape is shaming us all. Click the top right
1636020	1642500	X, then you'll see worlds switcher on the bottom. The door icon to hop worlds is what they're saying.
1643300	1646420	Refillings are so MLG pro, honestly. Like, we're not even gaking them.
1647700	1650820	Oh, you're so green. This refillings, like, literally so green.
1652740	1654980	That's amazing. Maybe we should...
1656020	1661460	Amala to tell us to all go buy green capes for scrawny. And then we all just walk around
1661460	1664420	with green capes, and like whenever we pass someone, they'll be like,
1664420	1668660	huh, what's going on over there? Why are they all doing their thing?
1668900	1675860	Wishes to trade with you, so I can't accept anything outside of, like, regular trades.
1678340	1691620	You get... you're giving me your Krusty cum sock. No! No way! I have a Krusty cum sock in my inventory.
1694820	1696340	How did you even get that?
1698980	1706420	All right. Gently used. Literally gently used. Right. I'm gonna eat. I'm gonna save maybe a
1706420	1710340	five minute countdown, and then we're gonna start with Cook's insistent, and we'll take it from there.
1710340	1722980	So for those of you who haven't made an account, we are on World 380. And we're outside Lung Bridge
1722980	1726820	Castle. When you spawn in, we are literally just... you'll spawn in this way, and you've got...
1726820	1729940	we're the left of the castle. We're just hanging out here, because we don't want to bother anyone
1729940	1734900	that might be spawning in over here. But scrawny, the character has pink hair. Or am I seeing pink?
1734900	1737220	Main has ginger hair. Like, I'm a junior.
1739380	1744500	Which thing? And then I've got green top, and then pink, uh, thingy. Prepared to get...
1744500	1745620	Billied nerds!
1751540	1754660	I'm trying to eat so fast. It's hard, honestly.
1756660	1761060	But I hope you guys have got hydration and eating. I don't know if it's an endurance stream yet.
1761060	1764020	Okay, but I have.
1764020	1773780	Ginger hair, cute outfit, and a rope. Yeah, yeah. You can get me.
1774660	1779460	380, yeah, 380. The refling in the game, of course, is gonna be...
1779460	1781140	Don't stop until you get 99.
1781140	1785380	Bro, you think I can stream until 99, Cookin'? I don't even know how to, like,
1785380	1791380	maximise Cookin'. The closest I ever got was, like, 80, but I'd rather do it live with you guys.
1792340	1798580	Buying girlfriend 50 gold. What happened to party hats? I remember people were, like,
1798580	1802980	renting party hats in quotation marks. I don't know what that means at all.
1812980	1818900	Delicious coke. I say delicious as if it's just not a regular fizzy juice.
1818900	1821860	Well, actually, it's, like, one of the most popular fizzy juices, so...
1825620	1829700	They decided not to have exclusive one-time items. Oh, even though they're tradable?
1830900	1834100	I guess they didn't, like, give enough out? Possible?
1835380	1838900	They can... they became common. Oh! They made it common.
1841460	1845220	You go to a good place for Cookin', and you cook till the number says 99,
1845220	1849700	or you run out of money with some of the fish. Okay, you're done.
1851380	1853940	Oh, people are getting, uh, minigames.
1856500	1862580	I was, like, I'm saying, come along with me, Miss... I miss Fauna. Wacky wacky, I miss Fauna.
1867700	1874580	Max Capers. How much playtime? 232 days says one. 314 says another.
1876180	1879540	I can't believe my little... my little reeflings are adorable little nerds!
1879540	1883540	I can't believe it! You can do just a feckin' adorable! Yeah, you like ringskates.
1885540	1888820	That's so precious. I'm glad you found a game that you really enjoy and can, uh,
1888820	1892420	throw yourself inside. It's... when you find that game, it's really nice.
1893220	1894980	Anyway, Assassin's Creed Brotherhood, let's get started.
1895060	1895560	Okay.
1901140	1905220	Yesterday, Avatar, No Capitalist Simulator. This is all really a trust.
1906420	1911380	Someone says 63 days, and I haven't even left this area.
1912500	1920820	Uh, someone says 1650 hours for a total of 1,800... I can't read numbers.
1921460	1924100	Big number. Big hours for big number. Thank you.
1924980	1926980	Hmm.
1929380	1930660	Oh, more reeflings?
1933380	1937220	Have we got more reeflings joining us? Yeah. Someone's got... oh, someone literally
1937220	1938020	is called Sway Sok.
1941140	1946020	A snowflake among snowflakes. Wait, what am I missing? What is this? Is this like super
1946020	1953220	RuneScape terms I don't know about yet? Or is this literally, uh, take the word heart
1953220	1957940	and remove the H and replace... remove the H and E and replace it with an F.
1957940	1962100	Relax. Snowflake is called Dark Humour. Is that the joke or am I missing that one?
1963300	1964660	Respect for the Iron Man.
1966340	1971060	Snowflake accounts are accounts that have extremely restrictive stipulations.
1971060	1976260	What does that even mean? You've somehow... you can't... Snowflake is a special account.
1978180	1980740	Wait, the Venezuelans are the snowflakes?
1983220	1986420	Game is not DJing enough. We need to make it harder. What the heck?
1993220	1997620	I think the skull and crossbones means this guy's a p-care over here. I'm okay.
1998980	2000740	Can only do content in a region.
2003220	2009700	Jeez. One guy's playing the game where if he takes damage, all... Oh, I know!
2010340	2017220	Uh, the Swamplatex guy. Yeah. I've not actually watched that series.
2017220	2023300	The No Hits run series, but yeah. Region locked. Oh, settled. That's his name, not Swamplatex.
2025940	2029860	I have still not finished the first fucking potato. I'm actually getting annoyed now.
2029860	2032340	Why is the food not getting away off my plate?
2035940	2039140	I'm inhaling it. I'm so sorry. I'm just gonna have to send it.
2040020	2043620	I can't. I'm getting too distracted trying to, like, talk into the...
2043620	2047140	I'm sending it. This is the fastest freaking eating you'll ever hear of me.
2051540	2054340	I've caught another bit of potato. I've never done this.
2054980	2058260	And, um... Okay, I've had enough of eating. I'm already bored of it.
2060580	2064180	I should weigh myself, honestly, just so I don't lose too much weight.
2064180	2067940	Because I stream too much. I was actually wondering about that because I've not had a proper meal.
2068660	2072020	I'm, like, ages out. I'll cut, I'll cut, I'll cut. Done.
2072660	2079460	I can't give life of a fucking plate. I've tried to eat it. It's taken too long. Right.
2083460	2088660	Okay. I was trying to eat a baked potato in prawns, and it was just taken forever.
2090260	2094260	Oh, I've had enough. Right. Is this everyone who wants to show up?
2094980	2100180	Can chat, talk to me, and tell me, is everyone here that wants to be here?
2101780	2103940	Talking with your mouth full, ASMR is trying to really...
2103940	2108980	It's fine. It's stop. If that counts as ASMR, then I've got a ton of content for you.
2109860	2114740	Okay. Is everyone who wants to be questing, is in the game right now?
2114740	2117220	Is anyone in Tutorial Island? Someone says they're late.
2117220	2119380	Okay, we'll wait. We'll wait. We'll get a few more minutes.
2119940	2124020	Right. If we've got a few more minutes, it's time to start telling jokes.
2125220	2132820	Why did Ernest the Chicken cross the road to get to the other side?
2136580	2140100	Oh, thank you. Thank you. If you didn't know, there's a quest called Ernest the Chicken. Thank you.
2142820	2148660	I feel your pain. Yes. Do re-log in on your questing account to render the other side.
2149540	2158100	I'm here. I've never opened this game before. Okay. We'll stand outside the castle this time.
2158100	2160100	We're just going to be right outside the castle.
2162660	2166260	If you want to start on a new quest on the account just to have the shiz and giggles,
2166260	2170420	we are going to do a main quest. Oh my god, there's so many reflings.
2170420	2176500	Like, oh, it's over. Thank you so much for joining me and being the law. I'm like so fucking happy.
2176500	2179860	Like, I don't realize I'm like, oh my god, that's a lot of this playing.
2182580	2189540	Right. Don't forget the riveting tail of lily pad labor dispute, honestly. I'm done for some shingles.
2189540	2197460	Okay. Why is his name Ernest? I honestly didn't know. I can't even remember. I hardly remember.
2197460	2203700	I'm here, but I've never opened this game before. What world? I am on world 388.
2203780	2210420	Um, the mods have pinning. Can mods pin world 388?
2213780	2220420	Free questing. I might work some unable to participate, but have fun surrounding reflings.
2220420	2228420	Oh, thank you. We will. We will. I don't think mods can pin. Okay. Can I pin? Can I pin? Hold on.
2228980	2234980	Ow, I don't know. Where's YouTube? Can you open up one stream? Strony cartels.
2234980	2241140	Tape it in. Oh, I'm live. I'm live right now. Tape it in. Oh my gosh, I'm live right now.
2241780	2243860	Pin message. There we go.
2247540	2250740	Strony, after the bloke completion, what do you think about the bad jokes
2250740	2256420	completion? Honestly, we should. Wish us to trade. I'll take anything. I've got a
2256420	2261940	crusty sock in my inventory right now. Oh, should I? You're giving me a chef's hat because I want
2261940	2268340	cooking. Yes. Yes. Put the hat on me. Please, please, please, please, please, please. I want
2268340	2273380	the hat. I want the hat. I want the hat. I want the hat. Oh, check it out. You can even see my
2273380	2280260	bunches around. Oh, look at it. Oh, thank you so much. Look at the hat. Oh my God. Check it. Check
2280820	2287620	it. Check out the drip lads. Yeah. Yeah, I'll show you. Check it out. Oh, I'm going to, I'm going
2287620	2291620	to stale on them. You ready? We're going to stale on them. I got that stale. Stale, stale, stale.
2296580	2305140	Put it away, put it away, put it away. Level one cooking. Level nine, nine cooking. Here we go.
2306100	2307700	It's everyone here that would like to be here.
2312900	2320340	I drink the thingy. Is she cooking? Very snazzy. Drop check. Certified cooking stream. Okay.
2321380	2325780	First quest. Open up our little quest adventure menu where the heck is that? I can't see because
2325780	2332980	iPhone's in the way. Excuse me, iPhone. I'm here to do something. Right, the quest is called
2333300	2340100	Cook's Assistant. Oh, oh, here it is. I'll read it out for you as for those who use it
2340100	2346500	are blind. Cook's Assistant. I can start this quest by talking to the Cook Lumberge Castle.
2346500	2355620	Difficulty, novice. Very short. Release 2001. Jeez. Storyline. Stand alone. No requirements
2355620	2361220	and no, no. Wait, someone else wishes to trade. I don't, you guys can't give me like main stuff,
2361220	2366980	I am. I'm gonna head to bed early and I'll use the stream as a sleep bed. I hope I don't wake you.
2366980	2374260	No way, I've got a penny. No, I have a penny as well. Oh my god. Wait, wait, sorry. Hold on.
2374260	2381780	Sorry, camera angle. Oh my god. I'm a real freaking woman. Oh, let's go. I look so good.
2381780	2386740	Thank you for the penny. Thank you for the chess hat. If you want to gift you games,
2386740	2394900	how do we do that? You don't. I buy them with my hard earned cash. Cold hard cash. Right,
2394900	2401620	let's go Cook's Assistant. I'll turn off running. We'll just walk. Right, you ready? Oh, Lumberge
2401620	2407060	Castle, do you mind? I don't want to. Come, reflings. You can follow me if you want. Ah,
2407060	2411860	wait, who are we fighting? Why are you fighting that per man? Right, oh my god, women's simulator.
2411860	2421140	Time to head to the kitchen. Oh my god, there's so many of them. Right, this Cook is like,
2421140	2429060	why are all you people in my kitchen right now? All right, yes, Cook. What's wrong, Mr. Cook?
2430020	2435860	Oh dear, oh dear, oh dear. I'm in terrible trouble with Miss. It's the Duke's birthday the day
2435860	2440580	and I should be making him a big, lovely birthday cake. I've forgotten to buy the ingredients.
2440580	2444900	I'll never get them now. He'll sack me. What will I do? I have four children and I go
2444900	2452500	to look after. Honestly, me with the... What? I have five babies, but one of them is a goat.
2452500	2458100	He has four babies and a goat. What are the odds? Yes, we're going to help Cook's Assistant. Yes,
2458100	2464980	I'll help you. Oh great. Oh, my little quest helper just popped up. Where do I find these
2464980	2471380	ingredients? Uh, I think I remember where they are, so I think we can just walk away.
2471380	2476500	Do I need to pick up a pit? I think... Do we need this jug? Wait, are we all going to be fighting
2476500	2484100	over the same jug? Do we not need a jug for this quest to put the milk in? Save yourself and run,
2484100	2492340	buy eggs here. 100 cold coins, sell an egg. No, do we not have to pick up the big egg and like the
2492340	2497940	milk from the dairy? Oh, am I going crazy? Isn't that like one special big egg and one special?
2500180	2502260	I've got 25, best I can offer. Real cheap.
2503940	2509460	People are thinking you are doing a drop party or something. All the folk following. Oh, no idea.
2510500	2517460	I'm like, yo, you guys have money? I can go get some jugs and drop them. Man's running a scheme. I
2517460	2526820	respect it, honestly. Are you guys grabbing all his equipment? Okay, right. We can take off and
2526820	2530900	get the egg, so we'll go to the front of the castello. If everyone has accepted that quest,
2531620	2538420	we'll go to the front. I think they changed it. Okay, right. Oh, no. It does look like we're a drop
2538420	2545220	party. I'm broke, so I can't afford any eggs. Don't worry, I'm going to take you to the egg factory.
2545220	2551940	It's me. Plop, plop, plop, plop, plop, plop. Okay. Oh my God, we like a drop party so badly.
2553540	2559700	Right, I'm pretty sure you get eggs across the river. Chickens aren't going to stand a chance.

2566260	2571060	strontilates eggs? I was going to do ovate deposit. I might even pretend otherwise.

2579140	2581860	Milk the cow. We need it straight from the teeth, you know?
2587300	2593380	A normal egg works just fine. Yes. Has YouTube ceased the culling? I think so.
2593380	2598340	We actually are submitting for monetization today. Can I milk your cow or do I need a bucket?
2598340	2606180	Oh, I milked it. But that's because I had a jug. Wait, did I milk it or am I going crazy?
2608820	2612020	She goes, Teehee, you've never milked a cow before. How could you tell?
2612740	2616180	Because you're spilling milk. What a waste. You need something to hold the milk. Oh,
2617780	2625460	oh no. Oh no. Where'd you get a bucket in this game? Right, we'll go get the eggs then.
2625460	2629780	Eggs first. We'll deal with a bucket problem in a minute. Buckets are from the tutorial.
2629780	2634420	Worked for me. I don't have a bucket. Oh no, I already have a bucket of milk. What the heck?

6165980	6173340	ghost well to be honest i'm not sure i've been told a certain task may need to be completed
6173340	6181100	so you can rest in peace i should think it is probably because a warlock has come along and

6675180	6683740	actually uses this to sleep though um i wonder if there's also a kumburu uh right what's the
6683740	6688700	easiest quest next or are we actually gonna have to level up i think we might have to get stronger
6688700	6698380	because everything's like um pirate maybe goblin village if we buy everything in advance for that
6698380	6705660	goblin quest i forgot the name of it romeo and juliet is good should we try romeo and juliet
6705660	6715180	romeo and juliet also an amniolet that's useful for the future right stronghold of security time
6715740	6721180	i've never done that one romeo and juliet is no needed stats okay we're gonna do that one then
6722140	6727100	i can start this quest by talking to romeo and varrock square where the heck
6728620	6736940	oh that's a big walk not gonna lie that's like really far away not gonna lie okay we cross
6736940	6743820	the bridge and then we just keep going all the way up to varrock i've already lost where romeo is
6745180	6748860	oh he's literally in the square of varrock well we don't have teleport stone so we're gonna have
6748860	6760300	to do it the old-fashioned way uh i heard it drops the goal in the amniolet i didn't know what that is
6760300	6768540	follow someone says follow just oh oh taxi okay follow the guy with the magma cape
6770300	6774620	wait make sure we get out of the graveyard first because we might actually get stuck on the gravestones
6774620	6784220	yeah you'll get careful you get stuck on the gravestones okay if you're gonna tax sales can i make
6784220	6791500	a cup of tea amniolet to make a cup of tea that little voice is getting for this is a magma cape
6791500	6801180	winky it is isn't it a magma cape whoa what is that wait you got a special accolade is that
6801180	6809340	a special accolade to this thing oh it's a fire cape i mean it looks like magma lava so however
6809340	6818940	named it is wrong we we must go directly into the dark mages oh wait i can't make a cup of tea
6818940	6824300	because i'm gonna get hurt by the mages for the weaker reeflings we're about to pass some
6825260	6830540	wizards outside of a rock that will attack us we need to be ready to run
6832300	6835500	go west near the farm oh so oh he says he's gonna go around
6836380	6841020	i think we have enough people to kill the dark wizards oh can i go quickly make a cup of tea then
6844220	6845900	watching strony stream
6847900	6853340	ah whenever i read the like last thingy you know the love heart you know he you can put a love heart
6853340	6859340	on stream like that little tap that love heart thing it's in the way if i read the most bottom
6859340	6864220	thing it says watching strony stream is the type of accolade yeah if you tap that heart i can see
6864220	6870940	when you tap it but it blocks the last message i'll be doing nothing but laughing if anyone dies
6871500	6875260	oh we'll also be at the bank so is that reeflings still there to trade the fish
6876060	6880460	there's plenty more fish i can only see it on mobile yeah i can see someone make a flush like
6880460	6885820	face smiley reaction it's in the way for everyone okay right i was gonna say because it's in the
6885820	6890620	way whenever i read like the most bomb message it's in the way that cape requires you to kill a level
6890620	6895740	700 monster like unless you guys can carry me through that monster i don't think we can do that
6895740	6901180	i've never done it before yeah i had to nuke the heart with an edulander i think you can toggle
6901180	6907100	away yeah i have to scroll around it it's a solo fight well i'm never getting that
6907340	6915180	hmm i am here with the fish okay we will be going next to the bank so
6916540	6923260	we should be okay i think is there any hopefully isn't too many oh yeah good idea to go to the
6923260	6928460	bushes first oh no these reeflings oh no don't get stuck on the wall reefling
6930780	6933820	that these are reeflings oh no i don't know if that's everything i might just be someone
6934780	6939020	there's three dots at the top of chat and no no i think it's okay i think it's there
6941180	6946860	fire cape would be fun oh no i don't even know how to do that i don't even know how prayer pots work
6946860	6953260	in like strength potions and all of that work and it's like all temporary but they're like a thousand
6953260	6954540	and it's so expensive
6955420	6965260	hmm watch out now all right weaker reeflings get ready get ready weaker reeflings stronger
6965260	6971580	reeflings beat them up show those wizards we mean we mean freaking we mean business beat them up
6971580	6976860	stronger reeflings will be the weaker reeflings are gonna stick together this is the best we
6976940	6978380	can do under the circumstances
6983420	6988300	run into the circle reefing no they're not going that circle these wizards are stinky
6988300	6993740	they're no good guys he's telling you fevers he's telling you the Fibonacci sequence because
6993740	6999420	those are fevers okay i think the reeflings like literally eradicated all the wizards for us in
6999420	7005980	the way thank you they're all dead literally just absolutely eradicated them i think the funniest
7006140	7014300	thing ever wow how can i tell it to wow how many quests this are i don't know if we can do all

8176140	8183100	appear dead then she will be taken to the crypt crypt again we're getting a bit creepy may you
8183100	8190380	must have some strange hobbies then Romeo can collect her from the crypt go to the apocryphae

10226460	10228460	You
10228460	10230460	You
10232460	10234460	You
10234460	10238460	You
10238460	10240460	You
10240460	10247460	Uh, brainwashing mostly.
10247460	10251180	What was that, what do you mean?
10251180	10252460	That guy's like, what's going on?
10252460	10254460	It's like, what's brainwashing mostly?
10254460	10256460	Okay, true.
10256460	10260940	He goes, ah, I understand.
10260940	10262460	Not called brain.
10262460	10266060	Right, okay, take a little left outside the castle.
10266060	10267460	Make sure all my beeflings are here.
10267460	10269740	A little bit of a left.
10269740	10270740	Don't work on me.
10270740	10271740	Don't have a brain.
10271740	10272740	Ah, bless you.
10272740	10273740	Okay.
10273740	10275740	Okay, please follow me, reeflings.
10275740	10277740	I don't want to leave anyone behind.
10277740	10279740	I want to make sure you're my reeflings.
10279740	10280740	No.
10280740	10282740	Okay, we are now going to go to the fishing spot
10282740	10284740	that is past the graveyard.
10284740	10286740	Not a cult if we're hypnotized maybe.
10286740	10287740	Technically.
10287740	10288740	Oh no, sorry.
10288740	10289740	I lost some reeflings that we're following.
10289740	10292740	Oh no, they're stuck behind at the church.
10292740	10294740	I'm so sorry.
10294740	10295740	Okay.
10295740	10298740	Everyone, get to the fishing spot over here.
10298740	10301740	This is where I used to fish as a child.
10301740	10302740	Mama and her ducklings.
10302740	10303740	Main break.
10303740	10304740	We're good.
10304740	10305740	Yeah.
10305740	10306740	And then look.
10306740	10308740	Wait, these reeflings?
10308740	10309740	No.
10309740	10310740	Maybe?
10310740	10311740	Not really.
10311740	10312740	But we can fish.
10312740	10314740	Everyone can fish on the same tail.
10314740	10315740	It doesn't make a difference.
10315740	10317740	How many bots we got?
10317740	10318740	Oh, these botters.
10318740	10319740	You can bought a shrimp.
10319740	10321740	Who's buying shrimp for hell?
10321740	10323740	I'm starting leading the reefling around
10323740	10325740	like a big school field trip.
10325740	10328740	We're all individuals.
10328740	10329740	Yeah.
10329740	10334740	We're going to fish and then we're going to get
10334740	10336740	like cooking level.
10336740	10339740	What is happening?
10339740	10340740	Beep, beep.
10340740	10341740	It does not compute.
10341740	10343740	One-o-one-o-one-o-one-o-one.
10343740	10345740	We're pretending we're bots.
10345740	10350740	Oh, are we such trolls?
10350740	10352740	Shrimp locked hardcore.
10352740	10356740	3VP bronze man market sunk by bots.
10356740	10359740	This is going to be fun to do without access to my bank.
10359740	10360740	Oh, no.
10360740	10362740	I don't even thought.
10362740	10364740	Hello, fellow human.
10364740	10366740	Hello, fellow flesh humans.
10366740	10368740	How are you doing?
10368740	10372740	Fish, shrimp, cook, many, big level, cook, keep, get.
10372740	10373740	Yes.
10373740	10374740	That's a plan.
10374740	10376740	So we're just starting with this.
10376740	10378740	Everything that lives is designed to end world trap.
10378740	10379740	What?
10379740	10380740	Is that reeflings doing that?
10380740	10381740	Oh, my God.
10381740	10384740	The bot just ran off.
10384740	10386740	So we're going to fish until our inventory is full
10386740	10388740	and then I'm going to chop down one of those trees
10388740	10390740	and we're all going to cook around the fire together
10390740	10394740	and we're all going to share little stories when we cook our food.
10394740	10397740	Like, what people do in communities and stuff?
10397740	10399740	So who's going to be the...
10399740	10401740	I'll be the fire master.
10401740	10402740	Okay.
10402740	10405740	In this batch of fish, we're going to talk...
10405740	10406740	I forgot the net.
10406740	10408740	I told you to bring it.
10408740	10411740	Now, the only thing about fishing is that it all expires
10411740	10413740	so you have to move to the next tail.
10413740	10416740	This is to prevent and hashtag and quotation marks.
10416740	10418740	This is to prevent.
10418740	10419740	Oh, hold on.
10419740	10421740	I'm calibrating.
10423740	10424740	Did it calibrate?
10424740	10425740	Yeah, calibrate.
10425740	10428740	I'm level fishing too.
10428740	10432740	Oh, the trainer guy should give you a free net.
10432740	10433740	Hopefully.
10433740	10435740	What is that?
10435740	10437740	So we're, yeah, we're just doing this
10437740	10438740	and we're going to cook the fishy
10438740	10440740	and then when our cooking goes up,
10440740	10442740	we can start cooking other stuff
10442740	10444740	and making other stuff.
10444740	10446740	That brings even more...
10446740	10449740	hardcore bro, watch out.
10449740	10452740	Oh, no, the tail expires.
10452740	10454740	Give me, give me.
10454740	10457740	Never seen so many real players.
10457740	10459740	Oh, that's crazy.
10459740	10461740	Can we cook strong aid?
10461740	10464740	Don't cook the cuttlefish.
10466740	10469740	Oh, I put it in all caps, but it didn't work.
10469740	10473740	We're all bought some cute cuttlefish.
10473740	10476740	Calomari, no!
10476740	10479740	Let's see if they know the secret roofling handshake.
10479740	10481740	I'm a bot hooked up to chat.
10481740	10484740	Chat GPT's Johnny Cooks in her own way.
10484740	10486740	Pretending to be a human right now.
10486740	10487740	I'm behind a paywall.
10487740	10488740	Oh, it's fine.
10488740	10490740	Chat GPT nine goes bravery.
10490740	10491740	Amazing.
10491740	10494740	They're like, what on earth is going on?
10496740	10499740	Okay, we're actually doing really well.
10501740	10504740	Runfishing.exe, honestly.
10504740	10506740	I'm character AI.
10509740	10511740	Oh, you wanna, you wanna what?
10511740	10513740	You don't wanna kick the cuttlefish.
10513740	10515740	No, you don't.
10515740	10517740	Oh, we're leveling up.
10517740	10519740	I can hear reeflings getting levels.
10519740	10520740	I'm gonna go grabbing it.
10520740	10522740	Yes, we're gonna be here for a little while
10522740	10524740	until we stop burning the shrimpies.
10524740	10527740	Oh, wait, doesn't that fishing tutor give you a net?
10527740	10528740	Wait, come back.
10528740	10530740	You can hear me anymore.
10530740	10534740	I think that fishing tutor might give a net.
10534740	10536740	Can I head pat?
10536740	10538740	You can head pat the cuttlefish.
10538740	10540740	Bunch of randies.
10540740	10541740	Yeah.
10541740	10543740	Oh, we're randy already.
10543740	10545740	Are you sure?
10550740	10553740	This random guy is like, oh.
10555740	10557740	We're a bunch of randy andies.
10557740	10559740	Instructor Unclear stuck in there.
10559740	10560740	Oh, no.
10560740	10561740	Who's making the fire?
10561740	10563740	I'm making the fire.
10563740	10565740	Are you already full of inventory?
10565740	10567740	I'm not even full.
10570740	10572740	I feel so much more fishing to do.
10572740	10573740	Just run to the bank.
10573740	10574740	No, no.
10574740	10575740	I'll make a fire.
10575740	10576740	I'll be a moment.
10576740	10577740	Oh, someone made a fire.
10577740	10579740	There's a fire there if you need to cook.
10580740	10582740	I'm wondering.
10582740	10585740	I'm actually going to do something mildly controversial.
10585740	10588740	I'm going to move myself here.
10589740	10591740	So you can see my inventory.
10593740	10594740	There.
10594740	10596740	So now you can see my inventory as well.
10596740	10598740	Yeah, that's better.
10599740	10601740	And look, I'm touching text.
10610740	10614740	Um, um, um, um.
10614740	10615740	Um.
10615740	10616740	Um.
10618740	10620740	No, no, no.
10620740	10621740	Don't do anything.
10621740	10622740	Um.
10622740	10624740	Okay, I will go here.
10624740	10626740	So then you can see my thing.
10626740	10628740	Oh, RindLight just made me take a screenshot.
10628740	10630740	Wow, RindLight's actually getting cool for that.
10630740	10631740	I'm level three fishing.
10631740	10634740	See, that's how much I've hardly fished up anything.
10634740	10639740	Taking so long.
10639740	10641740	New Twitter audio, licking chat.
10641740	10644740	I mean, that audio I made yesterday was pretty cool.
10644740	10646740	She's now eating reeflings.
10646740	10649740	I saw a sea over.
10651740	10652740	You'd let me bite me.
10652740	10654740	There was an error generating a response.
10654740	10655740	Oh my God.
10655740	10657740	Are you guys trolling this guy?
10657740	10660740	It's like I'm seven again.
10660740	10662740	They're fishing levels.
10662740	10663740	Oh my God.
10663740	10664740	Level.
10664740	10666740	Level three.
10666740	10670740	Level three fishing bestie.
10670740	10671740	I'm just so good.
10671740	10672740	I'm actually just so good at fishing.
10672740	10677740	I say that as a fishing spot disappears right in front of me.
10677740	10682740	Strawny, if we eat shrimps, are we kind of accountable?
10682740	10691740	You're in for a rude awakening when you learn what fish eat.
10692740	10695740	So true.
10695740	10697740	So lame.
10697740	10698740	Oh my God.
10698740	10699740	I'm level three fishing too.
10699740	10702740	So win.
10702740	10705740	Wait, you can share your fishing rank like that.
10705740	10709740	How do we do that?
10709740	10710740	What the fuck?
10710740	10712740	What is going on?
10712740	10713740	I'm scared.
10713740	10716740	What happens if we tell them?
10716740	10719740	What happens if they're like oh we hate beet tube roosts?
10719740	10730900	I don't know if you can read that because I was quite far away.
10730900	10733460	We're Shrimp Maxing!
10733460	10736500	Shrimp Maxing Gang!
10736500	10739700	Well, I'm hopping gross!
10739700	10741500	Oh no!
10741500	10744900	So gross!
10744900	10747700	We out here Shrimp Maxing, literally Shrimp Maxing Gang.
10747700	10749100	He couldn't handle the odor.
10749540	10754180	Look, we are smelling quite fermenting.
10754180	10757180	Average MMO player when he sees other players!
10757180	10758780	Yeah, I'm getting out of here.
10758780	10760580	And then, and then he'll come play.
10760580	10762780	But oh, this is all bots and dead.
10762780	10764820	And then finally meets like a gang of folk.
10764820	10767500	And oh, yeah.
10767500	10769020	900 XP an hour.
10769020	10769900	One tick.
10769900	10773660	Shrimping for real for real.
10773660	10776620	What a shoooot.
10776620	10777860	Strawni's Fish and Error.
10777860	10780700	Not that you are.
10780700	10783580	One might say it smells quite fishy.
10783580	10788420	Drop the strat for one tick and for real for real.
10788420	10790820	And if you're new to RuneScape, if you hold shift,
10790820	10793500	you can drop your inventory once you click.
10793500	10794660	I am a beatbit bot.
10794660	10798260	Please contact Strawni if broken.
10798260	10800460	Honestly, do you think the Jagex team are like,
10800460	10802500	what in the earth is going on over here?
10802500	10803740	We never see this kind of a...
10803740	10805020	God, it takes so long.
10805060	10808380	I still don't have a full inventory.
10808380	10810980	My inventory.
10810980	10811740	I'm not feeling it.
10811740	10812980	Wait, you booped the beeps?
10812980	10814500	I beeped the boops.
10814500	10815580	Beep, boop.
10815580	10816900	Social interaction.
10816900	10819900	Eugh.
10819900	10822740	How much?
10822740	10823820	OK.
10823820	10827020	Oh, you guys are making fires.
10827020	10831540	Right, let's see what level we get once we have a full inventory.
10831540	10832460	500.
10832460	10835100	I booped the boop.
10835100	10836180	I booped the boop.
10840020	10841140	OK.
10841140	10841900	We're almost there.
10841900	10843700	I just need to pick up two more shrimp.
10843700	10844180	Do it.
10844180	10846100	Pick up two more shrimp.
10846100	10848420	Check out that long.
10848420	10849340	Pick up them shrimp.
10852140	10854340	Dropping is faster.
10854340	10856100	I threw them them on the ground.
10856100	10859580	I want the XP for fishing as well.
10859580	10863180	I say that as if it's not like 10 XP for a net.
10863180	10865740	Honestly.
10865740	10869580	Is strong a slang term too?
10869580	10872020	Oh, I'm strong in myself right now.
10872020	10874620	Honestly, I think it works.
10874620	10877220	Any stronger?
10877220	10878900	My inventory is fully F.
10878900	10880500	I'm literally missing one fish.
10880500	10881700	Like, please just fish it up.
10881700	10882780	Oh, my gosh.
10882780	10885180	Finally, you can't carry any more fish.
10885180	10888780	Just click the raw anchovies or fishies.
10888780	10890820	And then let's see how many we burn.
10890820	10892060	We burnt the first one.
10892060	10894060	Cook the same.
10894060	10897460	We burnt the next.
10897460	10898060	Yeah.
10898060	10899700	Inventory full begin walking.
10899700	10902020	Sequence find nearest fire, honestly.
10905220	10906100	I'm at work right now.
10906100	10909700	I feel like my boss is like, you're on RuneScape at work?
10909700	10911220	Isn't that dangerous?
10911220	10913300	Can't you not get fired for that?
10913300	10914940	Like, please don't get fired because you're
10914940	10917780	watching a RuneScape stream.
10917780	10919700	I'm literally going to be online for quite a while.
10919700	10922180	I don't know how long, but work from home gang.
10922180	10925620	Oh, OK, OK, OK.
10925620	10928820	I was going to say, imagine your boss walks past your cubicle
10928820	10931060	and all they see is me typing in chat.
10931060	10932580	I'm strong in myself right now.
10932580	10936180	Like, I'm just getting fired for a visa for worth it.
10936180	10937220	I hope no.
10937220	10938700	Wait, oh, no, the fire disappeared.
10938700	10940260	Sorry, I wasn't cooking that entire time.
10940260	10943660	Sorry, I wasn't paying attention.
10943660	10944940	Look, I just get so distracted.
10944940	10946420	There's so many of you feeling threatened.
10946420	10948100	How am I supposed to not get distracted?
10948100	10949940	Oh, are we going to?
10949940	10951700	Level eight cooking.
10951700	10958180	Only another 91 to go because it's 99.
10958180	10959620	Is it technically?
10959620	10960580	Are you feeling a bit better?
10960580	10961140	I am.
10961140	10965660	I think I needed that food and just to kind of wake up.
10965660	10967660	I'm not sure why I felt so rough when I woke up,
10967660	10968220	but I feel better.
10968220	10969340	I've got food in my tum tum.
10969340	10971500	I've got a honey tea that I can't wait.
10971500	10973860	Getting a promotion from each of our boss
10973860	10974900	calls in on the office.
10974900	10976860	You're all she is based.
10976860	10978820	Technically, you're also playing RuneScape at work.
10978820	10982100	Oh, I wouldn't say streaming's work, honestly.
10982100	10983980	I'd say the only time it feels like work
10983980	10985540	is if I have to prepare.
10985540	10988100	Like, maybe for the game shows and stuff.
10988100	10990940	Level nine, by the way.
10990940	10991420	That's right.
10991420	10993140	Read them and wait for level nine.
10993140	10996980	Boss calls you in the office and says he's watching strongy too.
10996980	11000540	RuneScape takes no focus though.
11000540	11003500	OK, and now I am going to hold shift
11003500	11007460	and drop all these fricking, wait, hello?
11007460	11008940	Wait, no, why isn't it working?
11008940	11009860	I thought it was shift.
11009860	11011340	Is another shift to drop?
11011340	11012780	Is that am I going crazy?
11012780	11014900	I'm going to see.
11014900	11015420	Sorry.
11015420	11017900	Oh, it just seems everywhere.
11017900	11018860	Pardon me.
11018860	11021940	Wait, I could have sworn it was shift to drop things far.
11021940	11022660	Oh, my God.
11022660	11027260	Oh, no, you guys are going to have to watch me manually draw.
11027260	11028340	Bless you.
11028340	11029980	Bless you.
11029980	11031140	I'm manually dropping.
11031140	11031980	Please don't look.
11031980	11034860	I'm so embarrassed right now.
11034860	11037060	Oh, I'm a bit of an imposter.
11037060	11038900	OK, it's setting.
11038900	11039700	Oh, it's a setting.
11039700	11041500	Is it actually?
11041500	11043620	Why are we going to not have it on the pen?
11043620	11046060	The pen, all settings.
11046060	11046940	But I did all settings.
11046940	11048700	It's not going to just show my IP address.
11048700	11049940	Is that controls?
11049940	11052260	Drop.
11052260	11055100	Game play.
11055100	11057580	Oh, this is too much.
11057580	11059020	I want to drop.
11059020	11060900	I want to drop.
11061380	11062700	Click shift to drop items.
11062700	11063340	Beautiful.
11063340	11064180	I actually got that.
11064180	11065620	That was so good.
11065620	11067500	Right, hopefully my email address didn't show up.
11067500	11067860	I hate.
11067860	11069940	Oh, that's just how it is.
11069940	11070820	Right.
11070820	11071540	Oh, there we go.
11071540	11072180	Got it.
11072180	11073580	Right, and then we go back to fishing
11073580	11075620	because we're only level 99.
11075620	11080100	I'm going to check the Char View Cooking Gate.
11080100	11083540	We can do meat, chicken, and all that.
11083540	11086500	Trout is 15, which is a big startup rate.
11086500	11089220	So I guess we're doing this until 15.
11089260	11091820	And then we're going fishing elsewhere.
11091820	11095740	But as we level up, we get closer and closer.
11095740	11096060	Oh, my God.
11096060	11098100	Level four fishing, not to brag or anything,
11098100	11099580	but level four, all of us.
11104580	11105900	I'm pretty close.
11105900	11106820	Level fishing.
11110420	11111260	Wait, what?
11111260	11112060	Are you doing a command?
11112060	11113420	He's tapping a command.
11113420	11114100	Well, got run.
11114100	11115420	You catch the shrimp and burn them.
11115420	11117220	I'll burn them to hell.
11117220	11118860	Thanks for hanging.
11118900	11121140	See you when you come back.
11121140	11122140	Actually, I don't know.
11122140	11124780	I've not decided if it's an endurance stream yet.
11124780	11126380	Right now, we're just memeing and dreaming
11126380	11128380	and streaming and fishing.
11128380	11129900	And then we're fishing and we're cooking
11129900	11130900	and we're cooking and we're fishing.
11133540	11136220	My mind not working.
11136220	11137820	You just got to trust me for real, for real.
11137820	11140060	Don't worry, I do this all the time.
11140060	11142460	Don't worry.
11142460	11143220	Bye-bye.
11143220	11144460	Did you see it?
11144460	11145060	What?
11145060	11147900	What did I see?
11147900	11148660	The toenail?
11148660	11149460	Wait, what did I miss?
11149460	11150540	Was there something on stream?
11153700	11154500	I don't see it.
11154500	11155580	I see you guys.
11155580	11156580	We're all just hanging out.
11161900	11163660	Sorry, I've got gains to get.
11163660	11164780	Bye.
11164780	11165900	Bye-bye.
11165900	11166780	I don't have to go.
11166780	11169260	Bye-bye.
11169260	11170420	I don't think I was a roofling.
11170420	11173380	I was someone that was interested in what we were doing.
11173380	11175060	See how you feel like four hours go from there.
11175060	11177900	She literally at the start was, no, this will not
11177900	11179340	be an insurance human after a few hours.
11179340	11181900	She doesn't know anymore.
11181900	11182980	It's hard.
11182980	11185500	Just the bots hanging out doing a lot of bot things.
11185500	11188980	He wants to talk about his car's extended warranty.
11188980	11190140	Literally.
11190140	11191340	I do not want to talk to you.
11191340	11192940	Leave me alone, old man.
11192940	11195220	He's getting harassed by an NPC.
11195220	11196580	Shadow was rude when he get.
11196580	11200580	How purple are those anchovies?
11200580	11202940	Or shrimpies?
11202940	11207620	Oh wait, anchovies and shrimp are different?
11207660	11211220	Just tip some money for another four hours.
11211220	11213980	I'm like a reciprocal?
11213980	11215060	A reciprocal?
11215060	11220660	Donnie put text behind my screen.
11220660	11221180	OK, there.
11221180	11222660	Text doesn't go over me anymore.
11226140	11226820	Oh my god.
11226820	11228580	Leveling up, we're getting them gains.
11228580	11232140	I did not realize how slow fishing was to get.
11232140	11234620	My goodness.
11234620	11237020	Bye-bye.
11237020	11239660	She doesn't want to leave us, honestly.
11239660	11242260	Like after the...
11242260	11244300	So I can apply for monetization.
11244300	11247380	I'm going to apply after the stream and see what happens.
11247380	11250660	I don't know how long it's going to take.
11250660	11255460	But tomorrow's ASMR, so that's short.
11255460	11258780	And then the taste test and stream is short as well.
11258780	11262220	However, it might work out better because if I get
11262220	11266060	monetized, then I'm doing my pop-up monetization stream
11266060	11269180	surprise thing.
11269180	11272580	Oh no, I'm fishing where there's no fishie.
11272580	11273620	I wish you good luck on the money.
11273620	11276140	Yeah, basically YouTube just reviews the account and goes,
11276140	11277940	yeah, good to go.
11277940	11279220	Oh man, my bank is locked.
11279220	11280700	Can you hit me up again in three days?
11288380	11289820	I don't know what that means.
11289820	11291780	Back to fishing.
11291780	11293740	We're just fishing.
11293740	11298260	But yes, we're just going to level up as much as we can do
11298260	11298820	right now.
11302100	11303860	Any Ring Fit Adventure streams?
11303860	11307060	Yeah, 100%.
11307060	11312500	I absolutely adore Ring Fit Adventure.
11312500	11316420	It was really fun, as long as it's not dangerous for much.
11316420	11319660	Hard, but I'm pretty sure I got pretty high last time.
11319660	11322780	Do you have an idea of how many more watch hours you need?
11322780	11324380	Oh, I made watchers.
11324380	11328700	The problem was YouTube wasn't updating our stats for one week.
11328700	11332620	Like the stats are now behind one week.
11332620	11335660	Like it doesn't make sense.
11335660	11339380	So only now I can apply, even though after debut,
11339380	11340580	we had watch time.
11340580	11345060	Like it's just a bit silly, but we're submitting.
11345060	11349820	We also think now that we have one confirmed week of stats,
11349820	11352100	the culling stops here.
11352140	11354780	So you might be unsubscribed if you're watching in right now.
11354780	11357260	I don't know, but don't be afraid to like and subscribe.
11357260	11359220	The stream helps out, you know that jazz.
11359220	11364020	But we think the culling has stopped.
11364020	11366740	So a few ASMR group collabs and all that
11366740	11371100	are going to come out shortly after monetization.
11371100	11375260	Because the girls, some dummy used my email to make an account.
11375260	11379300	And one of the passwords I use, that's just a word.
11379300	11381020	As great news, ring fit my blood.
11381020	11384460	Please don't push yourself too hard like that one time.
11384460	11388820	I just really enjoyed it, but I can't do like, subscribe,
11388820	11390460	and send your bank card details.
11390460	11392580	Hell yeah.
11392580	11393500	Just thumbs up right now.
11393500	11394820	Thank you.
11394820	11398420	I don't know why, but I haven't been subbed on once.
11398420	11401620	Maybe it's because I got YouTube premium.
11401620	11404660	I don't know what caused it, because I did get marshmallows
11404660	11407660	that were like, no, I straight up got unsubbed by like three
11407660	11409860	of the girls that did this or whatever.
11409860	11411620	I don't know if it's also related to,
11411620	11413900	if you don't watch the girls like shorts,
11413900	11416180	or if you don't watch any content but subscribing,
11416180	11419420	then peace out, then YouTube don't like that.
11419420	11421900	And see it as bot activity, rather than someone
11421900	11424340	subscribing and being like, I'll come back later and watch this.
11424340	11427380	Like, not everyone watches YouTube shorts.
11427380	11430220	Which reminds me, I should have sent two shorts to Emmy
11430220	11434580	to review, because the editor had finished the shorts.
11434580	11437620	I'm going to do that after stream.
11438620	11440580	Solve by watching everyone.
11440580	11442900	Literally, if you watch their shorts,
11442900	11445900	or put some minutes and a watch time into them,
11445900	11449420	then I think YouTube doesn't take you.
11449420	11452980	I got unsubbed from some other VTubers pre-debut,
11452980	11453980	but not from any of the girls.
11453980	11456980	Good, good, that's what I like to hear.
11456980	11459580	So me subscribing just to support is pointless.
11459580	11464100	Oh no, like, actual YouTube subscribe is not pointless.
11464100	11466660	What happened was the accounts were getting called
11466660	11469660	because they were new, and for bot protection,
11469660	11471180	we were getting wrecked.
11471180	11475660	But we think now, because there's one week of confirmed stats,
11475660	11476500	it's over.
11476500	11479380	I don't think we got called at all recently,
11479380	11482100	like today, or when I was asleep, so.
11484820	11489020	Yeah, so I think it's only going up from here now, thankfully.
11489020	11491260	I checked the stats of everyone's accounts,
11491260	11493020	and we should have been at 5K right now,
11493020	11496180	but it's okay, we'll work back up towards it.
11497020	11500140	And yes, it's weird.
11500140	11502060	I know it's bot protection.
11502060	11504620	I had never experienced it before,
11504620	11508860	and me or my, it was aggressive on us, very aggressive,
11508860	11511620	but I do think it's, I genuinely do believe it's over,
11511620	11513660	especially once the girls get monetized.
11513660	11516260	I don't think you experience it as a monetized channel,
11516260	11518700	because that just seems a bit odd,
11518700	11521420	because they know if you're being watched by bots or not,
11521420	11522580	so.
11522580	11524500	Oh my God, my mind's a wrecking.
11524500	11526180	Okay, I'm gonna slip my, slip.
11526180	11529620	I'm gonna sip my tea, please.
11529620	11531860	Don't do anything to the slit, okay?
11531860	11533200	Oh, fuck.
11539700	11540540	Delicious.
11544020	11546980	But yes, I have a very fun collabs coming out soon, TM.
11551500	11553740	Ah, honey tea feels so good.
11554740	11556940	I can't wait YouTube to stop doing,
11556940	11558420	ah, literally, it's such a shame.
11558420	11560140	I felt so bad for the girls,
11560140	11561460	because we were like in the Discord,
11561460	11563900	and we're like, oh my God, we're at 3,000 subscribers,
11563900	11566260	oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, like,
11566260	11567900	getting ready to make, but like,
11567900	11571220	all of us held back from doing a celebration post,
11571220	11572940	because it just wasn't happening,
11572940	11574300	and it was such a shame.
11577260	11580100	I do have a special, like, congrats on 5K
11580100	11582060	for everyone post, and a 10K,
11582060	11583780	and then I don't know what's happening after that,
11583780	11585820	if I should order more artwork or not.
11586780	11589460	The 10K artwork is absolutely gorgeous,
11589460	11592340	so I can't wait for everyone to react to it.
11592340	11594900	But I can't, I can't let anyone know what it is.
11594900	11596340	I don't want to ruin the surprise.
11596340	11598460	Level 10 cooking!
11598460	11601300	We did it, we did it!
11601300	11603460	Are you squidding me right now?
11603460	11604300	Brian!
11604300	11605420	Can't wait.
11605420	11606820	My wallet is ready.
11606820	11610380	Ah, Pachinga, thank you very much for the tip again.
11610380	11611620	You can't wait for what?
11611660	11612660	The 10K?
11613900	11616300	It's already, it's free!
11616300	11618660	It's free to subscribe, young Uber.
11620460	11622580	How do you mean the...
11622580	11623860	Oh no, my fishy.
11623860	11626580	My fire keeps, the fire's pranking me.
11626580	11629060	It keeps disappearing as soon as I go get it.
11630140	11631300	I'm on level 11!
11632660	11635180	It stops you cooking every, every time it sells,
11635180	11636220	oh, I'm in the fire now,
11636220	11638660	I'm sacrificing myself for the...
11638660	11641660	Nothing interesting happens, use it on the fire.
11643100	11644620	I think they mean the soup with the membership.
11644620	11648060	Oh, sorry, sorry, my bad, my apologies.
11648060	11650820	Apologies, mate, I'm not that smart, okay?
11653460	11657500	I'm like kneeling out of the fire to cook these.
11663180	11665820	She, honestly, when I said I was cooking,
11665820	11667700	making veal or I wasn't kidding, okay?
11667700	11669580	I'm cooking by guess.
11669580	11671980	Okay, who is making that noise?
11674540	11677020	Sounds like someone's building something.
11677020	11678140	Building something?
11680620	11681940	Back to the kitchen.
11683620	11686220	We're getting, oh, pardon me, sorry.
11686220	11688740	Maybe we should be doing the cows, you know that,
11688740	11693740	so we can get, how to say it, so we can get combat
11694500	11695900	and maybe we can do a few more quests
11695940	11697780	that require a tiny bit of combat
11697780	11699500	so we don't get too wrecked.
11700500	11702620	Is there a timetable for super membership
11702620	11704260	or is it still soon?
11704260	11707580	It's still soon, basically, it's gonna pop up
11707580	11709580	once it happens, so we need to submit ourselves
11709580	11711900	and YouTube takes its sweet time to review it
11711900	11714500	and all of that, and once it's accepted,
11714500	11717060	it's up to the girls, whoop, by the pope!
11718460	11719300	Brian!
11721540	11722660	Brian, speak.
11723660	11727020	Anon, you didn't put anything in the box!
11727900	11730700	Thank you for the tip, Anon, I appreciate it.
11731700	11732860	I'm not gonna call you out
11732860	11734700	for not putting nothing in the box.
11736060	11739300	Hmm, but Brian didn't say anything
11739300	11740740	and congrats if your name's Brian,
11740740	11742540	you're gonna love these streams.
11742540	11747540	Ha, ha, ha, oh my God, wait, you must get startles.
11747780	11750460	I just got Brian, I don't know where.
11752980	11756180	Hmm, what's in the box?
11756180	11757020	Nothing!
11758140	11760300	Wasn't me in the donal, but still, LeMau.
11760300	11761500	LeMau, yeah.
11763340	11764980	If your name's Brian, you'll love my streams.
11764980	11767060	Maybe that should be my mole.
11767060	11767900	Ah, Brian!
11767900	11769500	Here's the nothing you ordered, miss.
11769500	11771940	Stop, no, I purposely didn't say anything
11771940	11773820	so you went tip again!
11773820	11776100	I purposely didn't say anything, Anon,
11776100	11779540	so you didn't do that, you giffy goober, stop it!
11780540	11782220	Here's that nothing you ordered.
11782220	11784340	Hmm, meh.
11784340	11786620	Yeah, you think you're so smart, you little sma,
11786620	11789660	you little, you setting up the desk right now, huh?
11789660	11791900	You twirling your hair?
11791900	11794220	You flicking your feet about the, I'm so smart.
11794220	11797060	Yeah, I'm such a smart, you're such a smart alec.
11797060	11800900	You're not smart, you know, on an anonymous?
11800900	11804540	You're such a smart alonimus instead of smart alec.
11804540	11807020	Oh, you know, I tried, I tried, okay, I tried.
11807020	11810140	I don't know, something, something, something.
11810140	11811580	Brian, Brian!
11813620	11815900	Brian, Brian said nothing.
11815900	11817220	Thank you, Brian, Brian.
11818340	11819500	Brian, Brian, Brian.
11819500	11821340	The one Brian in the chat right now,
11821340	11823300	his face is like, so red.
11825660	11827940	It's a smart fling.
11827940	11829460	Oh yeah, when reeflings are smart,
11829460	11831340	I'm gonna call them smartlings.
11833940	11835660	I wasn't even a joke, to be honest.
11835700	11839260	It wasn't even a joke, I just said what someone said in chat.
11839260	11840500	Hee hee hee.
11840500	11842100	Don't mind me.
11842100	11843220	I just got here.
11846420	11848260	He says I just got here at Lamo.
11849100	11850460	Stop, that is terrible.
11850460	11853220	I didn't add any more sound effects.
11853220	11855660	I was busy, I was busy.
11855660	11857540	I need to think about, what's a terrible joke
11857540	11858660	that no one likes?
11859020	11864020	What is the difference between a legume and a chickpea?
11871100	11873740	I've never had a legume on my face before.
11876940	11878140	Thank you, thank you.
11878140	11879340	I'll be here all week.
11882620	11883780	Get it?
11883780	11887100	Do you get, actually, A.C. should probably tell that joke.
11889500	11894500	Why was the pony taking cough medicine?
11895660	11898100	Cause he was a little horse.
11900100	11902940	Oh, oh sorry, I thought that was a good one.
11902940	11903940	My bad, my bad.
11904940	11905940	Hee hee hee hee.
11908500	11910500	A horse goes to the bar.
11910500	11913500	The bar man asks, why the long face?
11913940	11916700	The bar man asks, why the long face?
11920060	11925060	Oh, okay, okay, no more, no more, no more, no more jokes.
11926420	11928220	Sorry guys, sorry, sorry.
11935020	11937700	Two blondes walk into a bar.
11937700	11939860	You'd think one of them would have seen it.
11944500	11949500	It's like the goofiest gimmick ever, okay?
11950460	11952860	Someone says, hey, strongy guess what?
11955660	11958980	That's right, we're talking in chat and in stream
11958980	11960860	at the same time.
11960860	11962580	I chuckled chicken butt.
11967580	11968940	Someone said they chuckled.
11969300	11973860	We should level up jokes instead of cooking.
11973860	11975780	Oh God, are we that bad?
11975780	11976700	Are we joked?
11976700	11977860	Sheebie slander?
11977860	11978700	Wait, how?
11980300	11982300	Comedian opens a comedy date.
11982300	11984620	Are you, all right, okay, okay, hold on.
11987620	11988980	Are you all right?
11988980	11991020	No, you're all left.
11996540	11997860	We're getting like five eggs.
11997860	12000740	Deeper hour with these jokes, honestly.
12004660	12009020	Wait, are you guys are just giving me jokes to say?
12009020	12010860	Two fish are in a tank.
12010860	12012940	One turns to the other and asks,
12012940	12015020	how are you, do you drive this thing?
12016460	12018620	I'm just stealing your jokes.
12018620	12022620	I'm not even delivering them the way a comedian should.
12023620	12028220	Oh my gosh.
12030100	12031980	Oh, level 12 cooking.
12031980	12033780	We can do trout soon.
12035460	12038380	I feel like I'm taking damage of the emotional cane.
12038380	12039220	Listen.
12041580	12044660	Getting your material, these are terrible.
12044660	12045940	A guy walks in a bar and says,
12045940	12047620	oh, that was the blonde joke.
12047620	12049060	Two blondes walk into a bar.
12049060	12050900	You think one of them would have seen it?
12052900	12053740	Hmm.
12055220	12056500	I'm not burning too much.
12058260	12060180	We're doing all right, we're doing all right.
12060180	12061420	Oh, level 13.
12061420	12063140	We're really not burning that much then
12063140	12065740	if we're getting this fast.
12065740	12069180	I don't know what level you stop burning shrimp at, but yeah.
12070140	12071500	Reading the black ops will give me
12071500	12074100	PTSD flashbacks to second chance.
12074100	12077580	Honestly, that perk was so annoying.
12078780	12081060	I remember being Tismo enough
12081060	12085140	that I remembered if people were using it in SMD.
12085140	12088700	So I would keep fricking spraying until they were dust.
12094180	12096460	I could tell you the best knock knock joke
12096460	12097980	if you want to go on them.
12097980	12100100	I ain't got a song on board for nothing.
12100100	12102620	Where do cows go on days?
12102620	12104100	The movies.
12106980	12108220	Oh, did you already hear that one?
12108220	12109180	Okay, sorry.
12110180	12112060	God, you guys are, you get a tough crowd.
12112060	12114460	Tough crowd to do, honestly.
12114460	12115300	Tough crowd.
12116980	12119500	Some of you guys, okay.
12119500	12121900	Two muffins are baking in an oven.
12121900	12124100	One muffin says, boy, it sure is hot in here.
12124100	12127060	The other says, oh my God, a talking muffin.
12130140	12132340	Oh, didn't like that one.
12132340	12133860	You guys are really...
12133860	12136540	Two hydrogen atoms were walking down the street
12136540	12138300	when one turns to the other.
12138300	12140380	Oh dear, I've lost an electron.
12140380	12141220	Really?
12141220	12142060	Are you sure?
12142060	12143020	I'm positive.
12145900	12150500	Oh, oh, you guys know your physics.
12150500	12152140	You paid attention in physics class.
12152140	12152980	Lovely, lovely.
12152980	12153820	That's what it is.
12155820	12158540	What do you do when you cross a cow in an octopus?
12158540	12159860	Cowamari.
12162940	12164900	I think I'm gonna get kicked off stage.
12164900	12166580	I'm getting, I'm getting on.
12166820	12170100	I am, he goes, please stop.
12170100	12170940	I'm dying.
12173300	12174140	Right, right.
12174140	12174980	We'll give that a break.
12174980	12175820	We'll give that a break.
12175820	12176660	We'll give that a break.
12176660	12178500	No more, no more.
12178500	12180140	I don't know much about real physics,
12180140	12181740	but I studied VTuber physics.
12181740	12184660	Oh, did you hear Twitch updated its terms of service
12184660	12188780	and the VTubers have to be held to the same standard
12188780	12190620	as flesh tubers?
12190620	12193300	And everyone like, why did you pick YouTube?
12193740	12199420	I've told many times, and I'll tell again,
12199420	12202340	you cannot run a manager account on Twitch as well.
12202340	12203180	Well matters.
12205700	12209100	Strony's good jug dropery is one out of 5,000.
12209100	12210620	Oh, that's rough.
12210620	12212100	That's a rough dropery.
12212100	12213500	Are you squiddin' me right now?
12213500	12215020	Brian!
12215020	12218100	What is the difference between the sea and Strony?
12218100	12220740	Strony always tastes like fish.
12224180	12225620	Brian!
12225620	12228180	You got the, wait, what?
12228180	12229100	Did I understand that?
12229100	12230380	Iron Reaper?
12230380	12231180	Thank you for the tip.
12231180	12231820	What's the difference?
12231820	12232900	Oh wait, I don't even take off.
12232900	12234860	What's the difference between the sea and Strony?
12234860	12236980	Strony always tastes like fish.
12236980	12238580	The sea doesn't taste like fish.
12238580	12240220	Huh?
12240220	12240900	What?
12240900	12242780	Like saltwater?
12242780	12244060	I don't get it.
12244060	12246980	Oh, you want Brian to do jokes more than me?
12246980	12250620	You'd rather frickin' TTS Brian make the jokes than me.
12250700	12252340	Oh, okay.
12252340	12254380	Oh, okay, I see who it is.
12254380	12256180	She kept telling us to be positive.
12256180	12257460	It's hard without her.
12257460	12259260	Oh wait, sorry, I missed the start of your joke.
12259260	12261460	I think I just read the end of your joke.
12262860	12264940	Oops, I just read the punchline of a joke.
12264940	12265700	Easy.
12265700	12268740	Brian has some real comedic timing, to be fair.
12272220	12273060	What?
12274900	12276980	Brian is better at delivering the jokes.
12276980	12278540	Sorry, Strony, no fair.
12278540	12280100	Yeah, I'm gonna fuck you in.
12280100	12282300	Oh, when I went for a pee, I hardly peed, so I need it.
12282300	12284060	I'm gonna force myself to hydrate quite a lot
12284060	12287100	in the next few moments, cause I'm gonna forget.
12287100	12290100	How many tickles does it take to make a squid laugh?
12290100	12291580	Tentacles!
12292860	12293860	Oh, that's a cute one.
12293860	12295460	I like that one.
12295460	12297540	I like that one, that's a good one.
12297540	12299420	Miss Strony, this is my first stream of yours,
12299420	12300780	and I find it extra uncanny
12300780	12303460	that you're actually funny saying my real name so much.
12303460	12308140	Oh, it's because the TTS, the text to speech,
12308180	12311700	if someone don't knows, his name is Brian,
12311700	12313780	so I always scream Brian,
12314620	12317140	cause he interrupts me when I'm talking,
12317140	12318460	cause I talk so much.
12318460	12320980	I don't think the TTS has ever interrupted me
12320980	12322820	when I'm not talking.
12322820	12324620	I don't even think that's possible.
12328900	12330420	Brian, that announcement, yes.
12331540	12334260	Sorry, I'm really trying to finish this bottle of water.
12335260	12338340	What's Brian's Oshi mark?
12338340	12339940	Well, we'll make Brian a V-shaver.
12341900	12343700	We'll get, instead of Neurosama,
12343700	12345420	we've got Brian Samus.
12348220	12349340	Two eggs in a pan.
12349340	12351180	One says to the other, it's boiling in here.
12351180	12352740	The other says, wait until you get out of here
12352740	12354340	and smack you in the head.
12355420	12358020	I need to add, you're making me wanting to add,
12358020	12360700	like wha wha wha wha wha.
12360700	12361940	Yes, Scott.
12361940	12365900	Scott's are want to talk, after all,
12365900	12367940	and I wish, man, true true.
12369300	12371100	I have a lot of jokes about unemployment.
12371100	12372700	Sadly, none of them work.
12372700	12375780	Oh, who goes there?
12375780	12378740	How does a squid go into battle, well armed?
12378740	12381620	Get it, cause squids have eight arms, not eight legs.
12381620	12383740	People think it's eight legs, but it's not,
12383740	12385660	but it's cause it's like a misconception
12385660	12387100	that octopi have eight legs.
12388100	12389940	Hmm.
12389940	12391500	Add a boo, you suck.
12391500	12393740	Honestly, I probably should.
12393740	12398740	I want to add a wha wha wha, you suck.
12399980	12401300	Are you squidding me right now?
12401300	12402940	Brian!
12402940	12406900	A bear walks into a bar and asks for a gin and tonic.
12406900	12410700	The bartender serves them and asks, why the big pause?
12410700	12413500	The bear holds up its front legs and says,
12413500	12414740	because I'm a bear.
12418100	12419500	Are you squidding me right now?
12419500	12421300	That was terrible, reluctantly saying.
12421300	12424700	Impossible to not interrupt you when you're always yapping.
12424700	12426900	Scott, help me out here.
12427900	12429300	I was quiet for once,
12429300	12431500	cause I was letting Brian tell his little joke.
12431500	12433900	Thank you, reluctantly saying for the tip.
12433900	12435500	And the terrible joke.
12436500	12437500	And...
12438700	12440300	Oh, I get the joke now!
12440300	12442500	Oh, no, the joke's actually pretty smart.
12442500	12446100	I'm sorry, there was like three little dots.
12446100	12451100	It says, a bear walks into the bar and asks for a gin and tonic.
12451100	12452700	The bartender serves them and says,
12452700	12454500	why the big pause?
12454500	12456300	As in pause in your sentence.
12456300	12458100	And he says, I'm a bear.
12458100	12459300	As in big pause.
12459300	12460500	I'm sorry.
12460500	12462100	I never got that the first time.
12462100	12463500	I'm sorry.
12463500	12465900	Or if on biscuit impossible to not interrupt you.
12465900	12468900	I'm sorry, I wasn't thinking, I'm sorry.
12471500	12474900	Did you hear about the guy who got connected?
12474900	12476500	Why, OBS?
12476500	12479300	My OBS just is connected, but I'm still in game.
12480300	12481300	I'm still here.
12481300	12483100	Why does OBS do that?
12483100	12487500	It just connects me for a millisecond and it gives me a heart attack.
12487500	12488700	Why?
12490100	12491500	Why did they do that?
12491500	12493500	I said I disconnected for a second.
12493500	12496100	I really dislike when OBS keeps doing it.
12496100	12498500	I don't know if it's my internet or OBS.
12498500	12499500	We are so back.
12499500	12501100	Yeah, literally back on stream lots.
12501900	12503900	Where's Johnny?
12503900	12504900	I'm back.
12504900	12505900	I'm back.
12505900	12506900	I'm back.
12506900	12508900	I've been sabotaged by the BC boys.
12508900	12510900	It's time for sabotage.
12514900	12516900	Do you like when I pretend to be a guitar?
12518900	12521900	Do you remember that Star Wars movie?
12523900	12526900	Where that was how they defeated the enemies.
12526900	12528900	I thought it was the coolest thing ever.
12528900	12529900	I loved it.
12529900	12532100	And I cried at the other Star Trek movie that came out.
12532100	12533100	I said Star Wars.
12533100	12534100	I meant to say Star Trek.
12534100	12536100	Sorry, pardon if I said Star Wars.
12536100	12540100	The Star Trek movie and then sabotage.
12543100	12545100	How do you call a cow with no legs?
12545100	12546100	Grim beef.
12548100	12549100	Thank you.
12549100	12550100	I came up with myself.
12550100	12553100	Totally didn't read it from my wreath on Indie.
12553100	12556100	Karaoke where you just provide the guitar sense.
12559100	12560100	Eww.
12561100	12562100	Eww.
12562100	12563100	I just heard the cat.
12564100	12566100	The jokes are too much for the server.
12566100	12569100	I think I'm killing you guys with the sound board now.
12569100	12571100	I think we need to maybe give up a bit of a rest.
12581100	12584100	You got me so confused where you said the Star Wars movie.
12584100	12585100	That became Star Trek.
12585100	12586100	Yeah, sorry.
12586100	12587100	Sorry.
12588100	12591100	AC DJ Streamer you girls make an instrument noises.
12591100	12592100	Brian!
12600700	12601700	Yeah, that's what you get.
12601700	12602700	That's what you get, Anon.
12604900	12605900	Thank you for the tip.
12605900	12607900	Honestly, that wasn't that bad.
12610500	12612500	I'll level 14!
12612500	12613500	Over.
12613500	12614500	Oh, the fire.
12614500	12616500	The fire playing a little prank on me.
12616900	12617900	Hold on, the fire's playing a prank on me.
12620900	12621900	Thank you for the tip.
12621900	12623900	It was actually not a bad joke I'll give you.
12625900	12627900	Everyone knows that Star Wars and Star Trek are the same thing.
12627900	12629900	No, it was me on my song.
12629900	12632900	I really like, I really, I cried at the Star Trek movie.
12632900	12634900	I'm like a little baby.
12639900	12642900	Is it the radiation scene where he goes inside the chamber
12642900	12644900	and Spock is like,
12645300	12646300	and
12646300	12649300	if you've not seen the Star Trek movie, cover your ears.
12649300	12651300	He's got the original fricking.
12651300	12654300	Is it Leonard, Leonard Hoffman?
12654300	12656300	The, you know, Hoffman?
12656300	12658300	Oh, I can't remember his name.
12658300	12659300	I can't remember his name.
12659300	12661300	You know what I mean, you know what I mean.
12661300	12663300	He was in the original Spock.
12663300	12666300	Got to meet Spock in the movie and it's crazy.
12668300	12670300	Leonard Nimoy.
12670300	12672300	Any Leonard Nimoyers?
12672700	12674700	Right, are we staying here until level 20?
12674700	12676700	Are we moving on to Trout?
12676700	12677700	What are we?
12677700	12679700	What's the plans, Rifle?
12679700	12681700	And you guys are kind of in charge here.
12681700	12683700	As much as I like to pretend that I'm the one in charge,
12683700	12685700	you guys are actually in charge here.
12685700	12686700	Do we?
12686700	12688700	Let's just take a little look at the cooking guide.
12688700	12690700	Hmm, yes, yes.
12690700	12693700	A bit of, let's see what we're looking at for the, the meats.
12693700	12695700	No, the fish.
12695700	12697700	Okay, I guess fish is under meat.
12697700	12699700	We've unlocked Trout,
12700100	12703100	so we could go a barbarian village.
12703100	12706100	I believe they dropped Trout and Salmon over there.
12709100	12711100	What do you call a cow with one leg steak?
12714100	12716100	What do you call a cow with two legs, Limby?
12716100	12717100	Yeah.
12717100	12719100	What do you call a cow with three legs?
12719100	12720100	Tri-tip.
12720100	12722100	Tri-tip.
12726100	12729100	You can see if the crash occurs because the internet would be us itself.
12729500	12730500	Tri-tip.
12731500	12733500	Leonard Nimoy.
12733500	12742500	Yes, the famous voice of old Zihar Nort from combat.
12742500	12744500	KH, I don't know.
12744500	12746500	I don't know why I was gonna say Mortal Kombat.
12746500	12750500	I still love playing Civilization 4, just to hear his voice over.
12750500	12753500	Barb Village, the classic, we're in charge, huh?
12753500	12755500	Can I tell a dark joke?
12755500	12757500	As long as it's not gonna be offensive.
12760100	12765100	My password had to be eight characters, so I picked Snow White and the Seven Dwarves.
12766100	12769100	Oh, that's good, I like that one.
12770100	12775100	Don't challenge Death to a pillow fight unless you're ready for repercussions.
12776100	12778100	My plan is to fall strong.
12778100	12784100	Okay, we are gonna head to Barbarian Village, so drop all your fishy-fishies.
12785100	12788100	We are gonna rely on...
12789100	12790100	Oh, wait!
12791100	12793100	Wait, can we even fish?
12793100	12795100	I don't know if we can even fish.
12795100	12801100	I think we need a fishing rod, and we can't even fish because we're too low level.
12807100	12809100	We're too low level?
12810100	12812100	For fishing? For fish?
12812100	12814100	Oh, we need 20 fish!
12814100	12816100	Okay, it doesn't matter, we're gonna stay here.
12816100	12818100	You don't have a rod?
12818100	12819100	Oh, yeah.
12820100	12823100	Okay, it doesn't change your plan, sorry.
12824100	12827100	I reached overall level 150, let's go.
12830100	12833100	Actually, MLG, MLG, you can borrow mine.
12834100	12835100	Shabby!
12835100	12838100	And the harem, not to be confused with harem.
12839100	12842100	How's the harem and the sheepsters going on?
12842100	12844100	How did the shroom go?
12845100	12847100	Got a rod right here for ya.
12847100	12848100	Pants grab.
12850100	12853100	Okay, I guess we're just gonna be fishing and going for it,
12853100	12856100	because we can't even do fly fishing to get our own.
12858100	12864100	But we are, literally, we started on 7 and we're level 15 already.
12864100	12867100	And that's without getting the big stuff.
12867100	12868100	Shabby raid!
12868100	12871100	Hi, harem.
12871100	12875100	I was gonna say haremby, but rip haremby.
12876100	12877100	Bunny raid!
12877100	12879100	Hello, hi guys.
12879100	12883100	Today, I am playing Old School RuneScape,
12883100	12885100	which you're more than welcome to join in on.
12885100	12889100	We are achieving level 99 cooking.
12889100	12893100	We are just at the bottom of Lumberge Castle near the mines,
12893100	12898100	and we, I know, I know, haremby, my brain, because of the spell,
12898100	12902100	and we are currently just fishing to cook,
12902100	12904100	and then we're gonna move on shortly.
12906100	12907100	Who's online?
12907100	12908100	Who's online today?
12908100	12910100	I actually can't remember everyone's schedule.
12910100	12915100	Mercy normally comes online in quite a bit.
12916100	12920100	I wanted to play with you, but my internet is absolutely...
12920100	12923100	Oh, well, we are at the bottom of Lummi, if you ever wanted to join,
12923100	12926100	but if your internet is crap in the bed.
12926100	12927100	Is it not in me?
12927100	12928100	Is in me?
12928100	12929100	In me is coming on in an hour.
12929100	12930100	That's correct.
12930100	12931100	Brian!
12931100	12934100	Why are snails bad at racing?
12934100	12936100	They're sluggish.
12939100	12942100	Oh, so when Brian makes a joke, you all laugh,
12942100	12945100	but when I make a joke, I don't get none.
12946100	12949100	Thank you, Sherm Tank, for the don't know.
12949100	12951100	Again, everyone's laughing at Brian's jokes,
12951100	12952100	but when I make the joke, it's terrible.
12952100	12954100	In me, in me, coffin game!
12954100	12955100	Oh, we're stream sniping in me.
12955100	12956100	Hold on.
12956100	12957100	Is she playing the coffin game?
12957100	12959100	I want to see her reaction to it.
12960100	12962100	I was gonna get a highlight reel made of that string.
12964100	12965100	I'm sorry, strongy.
12965100	12967100	Brian is funny, and you're a woman.
12967100	12969100	You're not supposed to say that part out loud.
12969100	12971100	That's an inside thought.
12971100	12974100	That's an inside thought.
12975100	12977100	Because it's actually witty, right?
12977100	12978100	Right, you're done.
12978100	12979100	You're done.
12982100	12984100	Brian's stream, strongy's stream.
12986100	12987100	Shocking behavior.
12987100	12989100	Oh, there's an uncut emerald.
12989100	12990100	Why did you drop it?
12990100	12993100	You can use that for crafting later.
12993100	12994100	I'm yonking it.
12994100	12995100	Mine now.
12996100	12998100	Sorry, that emerald's mine now.
12998100	12999100	I'm keeping a hold of that.
13000100	13002100	You can craft it.
13002100	13003100	She sniped it.
13003100	13004100	Wait, do you want it?
13004100	13005100	Do you want it back?
13005100	13007100	I can give you a back.
13008100	13009100	You can...
13009100	13011100	She went for the uncut one.
13011100	13012100	Oh, you're done.
13012100	13013100	You're done.
13013100	13015100	Oh, you're already 99?
13015100	13017100	What the heck level are you?
13017100	13018100	125?
13018100	13019100	What does that mean?
13020100	13023100	You want to eat, literally, green and shiny.
13023100	13024100	I'll take it.
13024100	13025100	Come on, it's me.
13025100	13026100	It's strongy, green and shiny.
13026100	13027100	Oh!
13028100	13029100	What is that?
13029100	13030100	Is that a shield?
13031100	13032100	No.
13033100	13035100	That's awful.
13036100	13037100	I can't look at it properly
13037100	13039100	because of the way the camera angle's working this game.
13039100	13041100	Look at that shield.
13041100	13042100	Can't give up.
13042100	13044100	Strongy, what do you call a man with no arms, no legs,
13044100	13045100	and lives in a...
13045100	13046100	In a tiger cage.
13046100	13047100	Claude.
13048100	13049100	Cloud?
13051100	13052100	What?
13054100	13055100	Did you hear the joke about strongy?
13055100	13057100	It was incredible!
13059100	13060100	Oh, thank you.
13061100	13063100	Okay, I can fish for herring,
13063100	13064100	but I don't want to do that.
13065100	13067100	I'm going to be able to fish out.
13068100	13070100	Am I playing the coffin game so on current?
13070100	13071100	Yeah.
13071100	13073100	I'm interested and see what her reaction is.
13073100	13074100	I don't know what it's going to be.
13075100	13077100	That joke fell a little short.
13077100	13079100	Aw, this is incredible.
13079100	13080100	It's a pine.
13081100	13082100	Piney.
13085100	13086100	Gonna walk my dog.
13086100	13087100	Look, time.
13087100	13088100	Walk you look.
13088100	13090100	Hi strongy, how's the runescaping?
13090100	13093100	We are level 15!
13093100	13097100	In 99, on the road to 99, cooking.
13097100	13098100	We took our sweet time,
13098100	13099100	but we did some questing,
13099100	13101100	which was a bag of fun.
13103100	13106100	I have no idea how long we're streaming for today.
13106100	13109100	Jokes about strongy are usually sure of fault.
13109100	13110100	Shoot.
13110100	13111100	Oh, and I'm starting.
13111100	13113100	Okay, I just got annihilated because I started.
13113100	13115100	I'm sorry, I can't even make a comeback to it now.
13116100	13117100	If I wanted...
13118100	13119100	If I wanted a comeback,
13119100	13121100	I'd scrape it off your mose teeth.
13124100	13126100	That's disgusting.
13130100	13132100	Oh wait, maybe I should have done that.
13136100	13138100	I probably should have done that one.
13138100	13141100	Don't forget, level 92 is halfway.
13141100	13143100	Oh, we're getting close to 92.
13143100	13145100	I can feel it in my bones.
13145100	13146100	Feel it in my bones.
13146100	13148100	Are you actually going for 99?
13148100	13150100	Yeah, I want to do it live with you guys.
13150100	13152100	I think it would be so fun if we all do.
13152100	13157100	And literally, Refling gave me a boatload of fish to cook.
13157100	13159100	So once I stop burning fish,
13159100	13161100	I'm going to use them.
13161100	13163100	And I think that's going to propel me quite a lot.
13163100	13165100	I want to do it all live on stream,
13165100	13168100	and it's not going to be behind a member stream or anything.
13168100	13169100	You guys can...
13169100	13171100	We're going to need a bigger boat, I know.
13171100	13174100	You guys can literally come and join me at any point as well
13174100	13177100	when we do these kind of stream snipe things.
13177100	13179100	I also give you a boatload of money.
13179100	13180100	Yes.
13180100	13183100	A Refling gave me 10 million GP.
13183100	13184100	I'm like,
13184100	13188100	Jagex is looking at the account like she's clearly bought right now.
13188100	13190100	I have zero.
13190100	13194100	Wait, you want to do it with us live?
13194100	13196100	Yeah.
13196100	13198100	ASMR.
13199100	13201100	I have zero idea how RuneScape plays.
13201100	13204100	My friends just post images of the animal models in the game,
13204100	13206100	and they look very funny.
13206100	13208100	Can I get a Refling pet?
13208100	13210100	I don't know how to get a pet in the game.
13210100	13212100	Oh my god.
13214100	13215100	Oh my god.
13215100	13217100	Is there like a pet that looks like a Refling?
13217100	13219100	Gold laundering.
13219100	13221100	Literally, Jagex is staring at my account right now.
13221100	13224100	Could you imagine if I got banning at Jagex
13224100	13225100	and be like,
13225100	13227100	Hey, my account name's Scottlefish.
13227100	13228100	I know it looks...
13228100	13233100	I got banned because you guys thought I was like money buying GP or something.
13233100	13236100	I'm actually just a Vtuber and we're all hanging out.
13236100	13238100	Please, I'm banned.
13238100	13240100	Is there a pet cracking?
13240100	13241100	Oh, I can't.
13241100	13242100	Oh, Ally.
13242100	13244100	I just got a shock on my arm there.
13244100	13246100	That wasn't supposed to happen.
13246100	13248100	I don't know how I did that.
13248100	13252100	I think I accidentally jammed my elbow in the nerve crack.
13252100	13254100	There's nine pets.
13254100	13256100	How did you even get those emotes on screen?
13262100	13263100	Gold laundering.
13263100	13265100	If they ban you, it's because they...
13265100	13267100	They heard the joke.
13271100	13273100	Crack and deez.
13273100	13275100	Nevermind, please don't.
13276100	13278100	Look, all hail the fire.
13278100	13280100	All hail the fire.
13282100	13284100	I'm getting close to the next level.
13284100	13286100	I keep burning.
13286100	13288100	Look how much I'm still burning.
13288100	13290100	I'm like burning massive amounts.
13290100	13292100	I wonder when you stop burning shrimpies.
13292100	13294100	Maybe level 20?
13294100	13296100	I feel like that's like over-leveled.
13296100	13298100	For the fire.
13301100	13303100	Wah, 16!
13305100	13307100	Let's go.
13307100	13308100	Maybe a pet slug.
13308100	13310100	Slugs are close to Carlfish.
13310100	13311100	Yeah.
13312100	13314100	She is not cooking.
13314100	13316100	Literally, everything's burning.
13316100	13319100	I'm like missing out on so much HP.
13319100	13320100	XP.
13323100	13325100	There.
13326100	13328100	Hopefully the fishing gets a bit faster
13328100	13330100	because seriously, this is taken forever
13330100	13332100	at this fishing base.
13338100	13341100	Juke pet is closest to a slug.
13343100	13345100	Are we sluggy-wuggy?
13346100	13348100	What do you call a man with no arms
13348100	13350100	and no legs on your front porch?
13350100	13351100	Matt.
13353100	13355100	Congrats if your name's Matt.
13355100	13357100	Shout out to Matt.
13359100	13361100	You guys are going to start sending puns
13361100	13363100	where the finishing line is like actual names.
13363100	13365100	I got true.
13365100	13367100	I got true. You can start cooking at 15.
13367100	13369100	Oh, you got me?
13371100	13373100	My inventory.
13374100	13376100	Woah!
13376100	13378100	Reefling!
13378100	13380100	That's so much!
13380100	13382100	Oh my god.
13382100	13384100	Thank you.
13384100	13386100	Oh my god.
13386100	13388100	This will definitely go...
13388100	13390100	We're probably going to artificially inflate.
13390100	13392100	Thank you, Reefling.
13392100	13394100	I appreciate that.
13394100	13396100	I think when we get cooking level 20,
13396100	13398100	we'll take off and see
13398100	13400100	if we can
13400100	13402100	snipe some fishies.
13402100	13404100	Uh...
13404100	13406100	How you...
13406100	13408100	Barbarian Village.
13408100	13410100	There's normally bots always running up Barbarian Village.
13410100	13412100	And we can literally pick up the fish
13412100	13414100	that's on the floor.
13414100	13416100	My only worry is that it might be
13418100	13420100	quiet and we might have to swap
13420100	13422100	to a different server.
13422100	13424100	Who owns this hill?
13424100	13426100	We don't know. We're ten ants.
13428100	13430100	Okay.
13430100	13432100	You're done. You're done. Get out of here.
13434100	13436100	I guess the riveting gameplay,
13436100	13438100	the overruns get riveted and literally
13438100	13440100	just click and point similar.
13440100	13442100	But look how many Reeflings there are. Seriously.
13442100	13444100	This is all chilling.
13444100	13446100	It's a bit chilly.
13450100	13452100	Hydration check.
13452100	13454100	I'm really needing a hydrate.
13454100	13456100	Oh! That was like bats coming out of him.
13460100	13462100	Barbarian Fishing Spot on World Through 1
13462100	13464100	is one of the greatest free-to-play areas.
13464100	13466100	Okay. We'll probably do that next.
13468100	13470100	Mmm. Oh, do you want me to be reactive?
13472100	13474100	Oh, that really didn't...
13474100	13476100	Yeah. Okay. Maybe not reactive today.
13476100	13478100	Maybe another day.
13478100	13480100	You'll have to hate the chat though.
13480100	13482100	Oh, because it's boss.
13482100	13484100	Are you squiddin' me around?
13484100	13486100	Brian!
13486100	13488100	Brian, that's inappropriate!
13488100	13490100	Thank you, Iron Ripper, for the tip.
13490100	13492100	I can so cook some pains, okay?
13492100	13494100	I'm getting there.
13494100	13496100	You know?
13496100	13498100	Got to let me...
13498100	13500100	Got to let me get a bit more experienced.
13502100	13504100	Jesus walked into a hotel
13504100	13506100	and tossed three nails on the counter
13506100	13508100	and said, put me up for the next...
13508100	13510100	Ooh!
13510100	13512100	I don't...
13512100	13514100	I'm not sure if I can do that.
13514100	13516100	I don't...
13516100	13518100	I'm not sure if we're going to do a sound reaction to that one.
13518100	13520100	Wait.
13520100	13522100	The cuttlefish cooking fish.
13522100	13524100	No! It's the circle of life for fishes.
13524100	13526100	They eat each other.
13526100	13528100	No, no, no, no, no.
13528100	13530100	Oh, my God. Is the fishing going faster?
13530100	13532100	I literally caught two in a row there.
13532100	13534100	I need one more and I level up.
13536100	13538100	Mmm.
13538100	13540100	Ah! Went away.
13544100	13546100	Wait, does that mean you eat reeflings?
13546100	13548100	Only the ones that want board.
13552100	13554100	I can bring you back up again if you want.
13556100	13558100	Oh, like a cat!
13558100	13560100	It's...
13562100	13564100	All these jokes are really cracking me up.
13566100	13568100	Oh, shucks, guys.
13568100	13570100	I love the way you hate me up.
13570100	13572100	You're so good.
13574100	13576100	You're so good to me.
13576100	13578100	Hello! Hi, hi!
13578100	13580100	We're playing Old School Brits' Game.
13580100	13582100	And we're leveling up.
13582100	13584100	Who's driving this thing?
13584100	13586100	Mmm.
13586100	13588100	My only concern
13588100	13590100	cooking trout right now, even though I'm leveled,
13590100	13592100	is I'm just going to burn it
13592100	13594100	all, which is such a waste.
13594100	13596100	I don't want it to be a waste.
13598100	13600100	Yeah.
13600100	13602100	It's a gang, gang, gang, gang.
13602100	13604100	Gang, gang, gang, gang.
13604100	13606100	Is that a new reefling?
13606100	13608100	Identified.
13614100	13616100	That reefling's beating up that route.
13622100	13624100	My son had been
13624100	13626100	eating electrical cords.
13626100	13628100	What did I do? Grandumentally conduct myself.
13628100	13630100	Right, right.
13630100	13632100	You know what? Sound effect.
13636100	13638100	Oh, I got 4K.
13638100	13640100	Did I finally reach 4K subscribers?
13640100	13642100	But we didn't get called this time.
13642100	13644100	A Christmas miracle.
13644100	13646100	Thank you for everyone
13646100	13648100	who has subscribed. I appreciate it greatly.
13648100	13650100	I will start to...
13650100	13652100	Once I get monetized, I will start to
13652100	13654100	slip out the
13654100	13656100	1000
13656100	13658100	subscriber
13658100	13660100	and thank you ASMR videos very shortly.
13662100	13664100	But thank you so much. Don't jinx it.
13664100	13666100	I don't know.
13666100	13668100	Now that we've got our YouTube stats updated,
13668100	13670100	I'm going to apply for monetization
13670100	13672100	and then I think the culling just stops after that.
13672100	13674100	I did the same to Sheebie
13674100	13676100	and nothing happened.
13676100	13678100	I think
13678100	13680100	it's over. I do think it's over.
13680100	13682100	Did you know
13682100	13684100	that in every 5 years,
13684100	13686100	the Red Deer in Scotland have to be culled
13686100	13688100	over running the forest because
13688100	13690100	wolves used to be a natural
13690100	13692100	predator
13692100	13694100	in the United Kingdom.
13694100	13696100	But then once they were eradicated,
13696100	13698100	basically the deer,
13698100	13700100	obviously their population just went crazy.
13700100	13702100	Man, I used to play this with my cousin
13702100	13704100	and friend after school when I was younger.
13704100	13706100	My name was...
13706100	13708100	Ay yo, don't put your gamer tie.
13710100	13712100	What do you call a Scotsman
13712100	13714100	who is standing in the doorway?
13714100	13716100	What do you call a Scotsman
13716100	13718100	who is standing in his...
13718100	13720100	Oh, home.
13720100	13722100	Okay, you're done.
13722100	13724100	You're done.
13724100	13726100	Heim is slang for
13726100	13728100	home
13728100	13730100	in my bit means my house
13730100	13732100	in Scots.
13732100	13734100	I struggle
13734100	13736100	with Roman numerals
13736100	13738100	until I get to 159.
13738100	13740100	Then I just click.
13740100	13742100	Oh, then it just clicks.
13742100	13744100	Okay, okay.
13746100	13748100	I'm going to open up marshmallows in a minute.
13748100	13750100	If we get any more puns, you're all done.
13752100	13754100	I tell you more puns,
13754100	13756100	but I'm not feeling very punny.
13758100	13760100	Okay, okay, I get it, I get it.
13760100	13762100	Yo, just one Brian.
13762100	13764100	Whoa, I'm actually not...
13764100	13766100	Oh, I took this...
13766100	13768100	I was going to say I'm actually not burning that much.
13768100	13770100	I burned two so far.
13772100	13774100	Did I take part in the deer calling?
13774100	13776100	I did not.
13776100	13778100	I just know...
13778100	13780100	I just remember reading it in a book
13780100	13782100	and I was like, yeah, that makes sense.
13782100	13784100	Needs the marshmallows for the campfire.
13784100	13786100	Why
13786100	13788100	is Jesus the worst teammate
13788100	13790100	in an online shirt? Take some 3D...
13790100	13792100	Okay, you're done, you're done.
13792100	13794100	No more puns.
13794100	13796100	We love Brian. Yeah, clearly you love Brian.
13796100	13798100	You'll laugh when it's his joke,
13798100	13800100	but when it's my joke, um, crickets.
13803100	13805100	Wow.
13805100	13807100	Cooking, best I can do is burn meat.
13807100	13809100	Literally, I'm burning so much still.
13809100	13811100	I'm like, getting pretty high level.
13811100	13813100	I feel like...
13813100	13815100	All things considered, hold on, let me check.
13815100	13817100	Um, yeah.
13817100	13819100	I'm 17 cooking and I'm still burning shrimp.
13819100	13821100	I feel like 15 should have been the shrimp cut off.
13821100	13825100	If a shrimp is a one level one, um,
13825100	13827100	like cut off,
13827100	13829100	I feel like burnt shrimp is a lot.
13830100	13832100	Emmy's gone live in 5 minutes,
13832100	13834100	playing the coffin of her lore video.
13837100	13839100	And before anyone says,
13839100	13841100	did your development team just copy that game?
13841100	13843100	No, actually, no one in the development team
13843100	13846100	had played the game at the point she was conceptualised.
13846100	13849100	She was conceptualised in my image,
13849100	13851100	because
13851100	13853100	Con of Bro is the best,
13853100	13855100	and I don't care what anyone says.
13856100	13858100	Hmm.
13858100	13860100	Don't be jealous of Brian,
13860100	13862100	only because he makes better jokes.
13862100	13864100	I mean, yes, true, but you have other qualities.
13864100	13866100	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
13866100	13868100	Andy and Lily.
13868100	13870100	Where should you go if you can't stop
13870100	13872100	reciting Scottish poetry?
13872100	13874100	Ah, then no one's gonna get that.
13874100	13876100	Rabby Burns is one of her famous poets.
13876100	13879100	Who come and talk to me?
13879100	13881100	Oh, someone wants to trade with me.
13881100	13883100	Sorry, I missed it. Sorry, I don't know who's sending me a trade-off.
13883100	13885100	I apologise.
13885100	13887100	What?
13887100	13889100	What is that?
13889100	13891100	Reefling.
13891100	13893100	Is that gold?
13893100	13895100	It's gold!
13897100	13899100	No way!
13899100	13901100	No way!
13901100	13903100	I'm literally warting,
13903100	13905100	literally level 17 cooking,
13905100	13907100	and I'm dripped out in the gold.
13907100	13909100	Reefling!
13909100	13911100	Thank you!
13911100	13913100	Oh my god, I'm stunned.
13913100	13915100	Hold on, I need to do a little dance.
13915100	13917100	I need to show it off.
13917100	13919100	Wait, let me go in the hell so you can all see me, okay?
13919100	13921100	Alright, I need to face you from the hell.
13921100	13923100	So I'm on the hell, and you face there.
13923100	13925100	Ready? Ready? We go stunned on them.
13925100	13927100	We go stunned.
13927100	13929100	Hey, that's right. Hey, a little parallel.
13929100	13931100	See it from the back, see it from the back.
13931100	13933100	Yeah, that's right, do a little dance.
13933100	13935100	That's right, that's right, stunned on them.
13935100	13937100	Dancing.
13937100	13939100	That's right, gold, gold, gold, baby.
13939100	13941100	Yeah, we love...
13941100	13943100	I love the head.
13943100	13945100	Bang a mot is absolutely awful.
13945100	13947100	That is awful, that mot.
13947100	13949100	Oh my god.
13949100	13951100	Yeah, we love gold, play an apron over here.
13951100	13953100	Thanks, god, you are cute.
13953100	13955100	Brian!
13955100	13957100	Ooh!
13957100	13959100	Oh no, TTS didn't meet that out.
13959100	13961100	Oh no.
13961100	13963100	Or did it? Did I talk over it? I'm sorry.
13963100	13965100	Brian, Iron, thank you for the tip again.
13965100	13967100	You can't cook, you can't make jokes.
13967100	13969100	Yeah, you are cute.
13969100	13971100	So the thing I got from me.
13971100	13973100	We started out and we blown them a kiss.
13973100	13975100	You want to beat me?
13975100	13977100	Oh, you want to beat me because I've got that gold?
13977100	13979100	Oh yeah, you do.
13979100	13981100	Panic. Oh, look at that.
13981100	13983100	Hey, hey, hit him with the knees.
13983100	13985100	Hit him with the knees.
13985100	13987100	Hit him with the knees.
13987100	13989100	Oh my god, that's so good.
13989100	13991100	Okay, fashion shows over.
13991100	13993100	Folk straight back to the sleeve mill.
13993100	13995100	Over again.
13995100	13997100	Oh my god, we hit him with the knees.
13997100	13999100	Oh, that was so good.
13999100	14001100	The drip is so good.
14001100	14003100	Thank you so much for playing.
14003100	14005100	You are throwing everything into that head bang.
14005100	14007100	Honestly.
14007100	14009100	Blowing out your back.
14009100	14011100	What?
14011100	14013100	Blowing out your back?
14013100	14015100	You want to blow my back out?
14015100	14017100	Oh my god.
14017100	14019100	I love the gold.
14019100	14021100	It so doesn't match my green or purple,
14021100	14023100	but I don't care.
14023100	14025100	It's so good.
14027100	14029100	I didn't even know you could get
14029100	14031100	golden chef's hat and stuff.
14031100	14033100	The fact that I'm level 17 in cooking
14033100	14035100	makes it even funnier that I'm dripped out
14035100	14037100	in golden chef stuff.
14037100	14039100	Honestly.
14039100	14041100	Time's straight.
14041100	14043100	The richest and most popular
14043100	14045100	cooking rinse scape, honestly.
14045100	14047100	Wait, hold on.
14047100	14049100	No.
14049100	14051100	It's Emmy.
14051100	14053100	Is it real Emmy?
14053100	14055100	Are you guys fricking throwing as Emmy?
14055100	14057100	Except trade.
14057100	14059100	Is Emmy here?
14059100	14061100	Or is Emmy doing this right before her stream?
14061100	14063100	Emmy, is that you?
14063100	14065100	Emmy?
14065100	14067100	Is that her?
14067100	14069100	Emmy? She's giving me her coins
14069100	14071100	from Starter Island.
14071100	14073100	Her 25 coins.
14073100	14075100	Emmy?
14075100	14077100	Is it imposter?
14077100	14079100	If it's Emmy, it would be like, no way.
14079100	14081100	It's a new account. She gave me her...
14081100	14083100	She gave me the coins from
14083100	14085100	Tutorial Island.
14085100	14087100	Little sister?
14087100	14089100	Say two?
14089100	14091100	Oh, I need to give her bad French.
14093100	14095100	Oh, thank you for the bond offer.
14095100	14097100	I bought membership for a month. Thank you so much.
14097100	14099100	Please keep that bond for yourself.
14099100	14101100	I have membership for a month. I think we're going to try
14101100	14103100	and do 99 cooking in a month.
14103100	14105100	Thank you so much for that offer, though. I really appreciate that.
14105100	14107100	Really do.
14107100	14109100	Is that a bond?
14109100	14111100	Is that Emmy?
14111100	14113100	Do we know if it's Emmy?
14113100	14115100	She's going to build up stream and she's either
14115100	14117100	going to be all cheeky and like,
14117100	14119100	of course that was me.
14119100	14121100	Or she's going to be like, what?
14121100	14123100	Rins...what? Rinscape?
14123100	14125100	I've never played Rinscape before.
14127100	14129100	I've never played that game before.
14131100	14133100	Oh my god, Stroneys, why are you coded?
14133100	14135100	Rinscape.
14137100	14139100	Scaling costume homie is probably
14139100	14141100	in there. Wait, what?
14141100	14143100	Are we getting bullies?
14143100	14145100	Are we bullying each other?
14145100	14147100	We better not be.
14149100	14151100	She's...
14151100	14153100	Hope on the phone.
14153100	14155100	Can't wait for the 99 Kicking.
14155100	14157100	Your fish dates will be fantastic.
14157100	14159100	Oh.
14161100	14163100	That was actually pretty good.
14163100	14165100	Who wants to trade?
14165100	14167100	Who...who is yummy?
14167100	14169100	Who is yummy?
14169100	14171100	I thought it said who is Emmy. I've got Emmy on my mind now.
14171100	14173100	Oh, oh.
14173100	14175100	Whoa, whoa, whoa.
14177100	14179100	Refluence, how are you also
14179100	14181100	reflate?
14181100	14183100	Bro, we need to take this to the bank like right now.
14183100	14185100	I cannot be standing with this much money on me.
14185100	14187100	Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh.
14191100	14193100	What? What? How are you also rich in this game?
14197100	14199100	Oh, you can't be telling your ages.
14199100	14201100	A.C. is going to be happy that you're all
14201100	14203100	O.G. sons.
14203100	14205100	She's going to be in an extra smug about it.
14205100	14207100	Agnashia.
14207100	14209100	How are you also rich in this game? How do you
14209100	14211100	make money in this game, honestly?
14211100	14213100	Maybe we should...
14213100	14215100	Winner.
14215100	14217100	I'm about to level up. What level?
14217100	14219100	I said I'm about to level up.
14219100	14221100	Okay, there we go. 18
14221100	14223100	Kooten. Okay, that's good.
14223100	14225100	We're so close to 20.
14225100	14227100	Maybe we should stick around.
14227100	14229100	Oh my God, look how much...
14229100	14231100	Look at the fat stacks.
14231100	14233100	Like, oh my gosh.
14233100	14235100	Oh my gosh.
14235100	14237100	How?
14237100	14239100	Oh gosh.
14239100	14241100	Right, we do that.
14241100	14243100	They make money selling the food you cook.
14243100	14245100	Oh my God, cooked fish runs?
14247100	14249100	It was...
14249100	14251100	my non-Iron Man account.
14251100	14253100	Ah, since I can't trade on that.
14253100	14255100	Oh, is you can prompt? Yeah, I get it.
14255100	14257100	I get it.
14257100	14259100	Is this an original couple?
14259100	14261100	Oh, it's Lou.
14261100	14263100	Amy is on her loading screen.
14263100	14265100	Who knows what she's doing behind that screen?
14265100	14267100	I'd buy food from Strawni.
14267100	14269100	Yeah, would you?
14269100	14271100	Would you buy my homemade ink?
14271100	14273100	Or would you like it?
14273100	14275100	Great.
14275100	14277100	Right.
14277100	14279100	If Amy's on her loading screen,
14279100	14281100	mods may you please post
14281100	14283100	Emicals is linked.
14283100	14285100	And can you guys please interrogate her
14285100	14287100	and say is she on RuneScape
14287100	14289100	or is someone...
14289100	14291100	someone larping as my little sister?
14291100	14293100	I want my real little sister.
14293100	14295100	Amy's life story...
14295100	14297100	That's awful. Who named that?
14297100	14299100	I don't know.
14307100	14309100	Music's so nice and chill.
14309100	14311100	But yes, Amy is going live
14311100	14313100	with the coffin of Andy and Laylee.
14313100	14315100	It's a bit of a reading simulator, just warning for those.
14317100	14319100	Make sure you tell her to hydrate through it
14319100	14321100	if she's going to be reading absolutely everything.
14321100	14323100	Because, oh my gosh.
14327100	14329100	Hmm.
14331100	14333100	She said nah.
14335100	14339100	Who is larping as my little sister?
14339100	14341100	Giving me 25 coins.
14341100	14343100	Is that my 20%
14343100	14345100	that you gave me?
14347100	14349100	What color is the ink?
14349100	14351100	It's been described as
14351100	14353100	glippy.
14353100	14355100	Someone...
14355100	14357100	Actually, I said this the other day.
14357100	14359100	Whoever said it's like
14359100	14361100	a male jar, you're done.
14361100	14363100	I don't know who said that.
14363100	14365100	Hello reflings!
14365100	14367100	Oh, and you really refling joined the fray.
14367100	14369100	Yes, we're on World 388
14369100	14371100	and we're at the bottom of...
14371100	14373100	We're south of Lumberge Castle
14373100	14375100	at the mining slash fishing tutorial
14375100	14377100	area.
14377100	14379100	Or to the east of the swamp
14379100	14381100	under Lumberge...
14381100	14383100	to Castle.
14383100	14385100	If she knows nothing,
14385100	14387100	she's going to like it for sure.
14387100	14389100	Andy and Lele
14389100	14391100	is a mess up game.
14391100	14393100	It has very unique story plot.
14393100	14395100	Oh, please keep going.
14395100	14397100	You cast your net.
14397100	14399100	We're almost 20 cooking.
14399100	14401100	When we're 20 cooking, we're going to move on
14401100	14403100	to the next place.
14403100	14405100	Which is Barbarian Village.
14405100	14407100	I don't know if there's going to be bot spam in there.
14407100	14409100	I could have sworn I came across a religion bot
14409100	14411100	before that was spamming.
14411100	14413100	And I was like, there is no way
14413100	14415100	someone's paying
14415100	14417100	for that. It was the most bizarre thing.
14417100	14419100	This place
14419100	14421100	has got to smell terrobin.
14421100	14423100	Literally rotten fish on the floor
14423100	14425100	everywhere. Burnt fish, cooked fish.
14425100	14427100	Like, the whole
14427100	14429100	of Gelenor can smell our operation
14429100	14431100	front over here.
14435100	14437100	Wah, hydration, hydration, hydration.
14441100	14443100	Woof woof
14443100	14445100	Woof woof
14445100	14447100	How is our fishing level so low?
14447100	14449100	What is it?
14449100	14451100	Our fishing is 12,
14451100	14453100	but our cooking is all the way up at 18.
14461100	14463100	They did not have to
14463100	14465100	look so hard on the music in this game,
14465100	14467100	but so good.
14468100	14470100	Oh my god, we're getting flexed on.
14470100	14472100	Someone's got a fishing rod.
14475100	14477100	Actually getting flexed on, hold on.
14477100	14479100	Is that how you pick up anchovies
14479100	14481100	by the fishing rod?
14487100	14489100	Well, Amy's going to force chat to get her
14489100	14491100	down.
14491100	14493100	There's only,
14493100	14495100	all I'm going to say is there's only one
14495100	14497100	way to finish that game.
14497100	14499100	There's only one way to finish that game.
14501100	14503100	You should work in the seafood business
14503100	14505100	on the floor.
14505100	14507100	Imagine getting followed by
14507100	14509100	Jehovah's Witnesses, even an old school
14509100	14511100	runes game, honestly!
14511100	14513100	There's bots, like, and it's like,
14513100	14515100	why? You get more XP
14515100	14517100	for cooking rather than fishing.
14517100	14519100	Yeah, there's only one
14519100	14521100	real ending to that game.
14521100	14523100	And I will accept no other.
14526100	14528100	Mmm, any food by
14528100	14530100	Strongly Seafood.
14530100	14532100	If I see it, I eat it.
14532100	14534100	Ooh, that's good, I like that.
14535100	14537100	Could I interest you
14537100	14539100	in our Lord and Savior? Yeah,
14539100	14541100	have you heard of our Lord and Savior, Brian?
14541100	14543100	Honestly.
14543100	14545100	I think, I can't remember
14545100	14547100	if I said this or not. I thought
14547100	14549100	they were just shouting out, like, randomly.
14549100	14551100	I would just shout, like, the most common, like,
14551100	14553100	boy names and, like, a chance
14553100	14555100	for someone to hear their name.
14555100	14557100	Just play Jack!
14557100	14559100	And then we just go back to the gameplay
14559100	14561100	and I play Nothing Happened.
14561100	14563100	What's another popular boy name?
14563100	14565100	I have no idea. Jacob!
14565100	14567100	Oh, there we go.
14567100	14569100	And then we just go back to the gameplay.
14569100	14571100	I play Nothing Happened.
14571100	14573100	Just, like, freak out whoever's listening in
14573100	14575100	and just be like, oh my god, that's my name.
14575100	14577100	I don't know.
14577100	14579100	That's popular.
14579100	14581100	Okay.
14581100	14583100	Little inventory.
14583100	14585100	Okay, now you just pin your own...
14585100	14587100	Oh, John's the comment.
14587100	14589100	John!
14589100	14591100	Andrew, wake up!
14593100	14595100	Hey.
14595100	14597100	Oh, Joseph, there's a lot of J names.
14597100	14599100	J-J-J-John.
14599100	14601100	Dude, dude, dude, dude, dude, dude, dude...
14601100	14603100	The fire is tricking me again.
14603100	14605100	I don't know.
14605100	14607100	I'll see what I can do. I don't know.
14607100	14609100	I find it fun, like, kind of trolling a bit like that
14609100	14611100	and you just, like, secretly...
14611100	14613100	I know! Yeah, see?
14613100	14615100	I wanted... I'm actually gonna...
14615100	14617100	I'll spoil this.
14617100	14619100	I want to do a hypnosis-themed audio
14619100	14621100	where I get you to forget
14621100	14623100	your name and respond to wefling.
14623100	14625100	I think that'd be pretty cool.
14625100	14627100	But I will put, like,
14627100	14630420	wears off after like 30 minutes type thing.
14630420	14632180	I don't want anyone panicking thinking they're,
14632180	14634300	they're gonna like pair them up, forget their name.
14634300	14636260	If you say Brian three times in front of a mirror,
14636260	14638980	you can summon him and he tells us a pun.
14641380	14642700	Mmm.
14642700	14645260	19, oh, we're so close, we're so close.
14645260	14649380	Maybe like one more rack of fish and then we're done.
14649380	14651140	If I don't burn any,
14651140	14653140	actually they're really starting not to get burnt.
14653140	14655300	I'm really happy with that.
14655300	14656780	Oh, that's someone cutting down a tree.
14656780	14657620	That's what that noise is.
14657620	14659180	I just couldn't hear it.
14659180	14661060	Ripped to all those with this obscure,
14661060	14662620	yeah, like that's the only reason I was like,
14662620	14664620	oh, it's probably not that fun for those
14664620	14667740	who have like obscure name type thing going on.
14668740	14670460	No strong, you make it so it never wears off.
14670460	14672620	No, I have to make it wear off.
14673980	14676580	I'm not really into perma effect hypnosis.
14676580	14677820	It's just not for me.
14678780	14683140	Um, rather a bit, a bit scared of it.
14683140	14684780	Are you slidding me right now?
14684780	14686220	Brian.
14686220	14687740	Anakin, start panicking.
14687740	14689980	I don't have a planakin.
14689980	14691980	Banana, Anakin.
14691980	14694460	Thank you for the tip, Iron Weeper.
14694460	14698580	There was a really popular meme about Anakin
14698580	14701740	and it was like Bananakin and that was the meme.
14701740	14703460	And it had everyone in hysterics.
14703460	14705660	It had them in a choke hold for years.
14706660	14709020	Absolute shawng behavior, shawng.
14710300	14712100	Because thanks for the tip.
14712100	14713340	Anakin, start panicking.
14713340	14714980	I don't have a planakin.
14714980	14715820	That sounds like that song.
14715820	14719620	Here comes Michael Finnegan.
14719620	14721780	He had whiskers on his chin again.
14723380	14724780	Sutton, Sutton.
14725860	14728420	Back to the begin again.
14728420	14730140	Da, da, da, da, da.
14730140	14731820	I can never remember.
14732900	14735500	The best you're getting at me is twinkle twinkle little star.
14735500	14737580	You'll either take it or leave it.
14740260	14743020	Maybe Vader some day later.
14743020	14744380	Oh, I don't remember that part.
14744420	14746500	I remember the Yoda song where it goes like.
14747500	14749220	Oh, someone dropped a party hat.
14749220	14751060	Oh, we can put.
14751060	14752140	Oh, I've got my chef's hat.
14752140	14753100	Look, reflings.
14753100	14753940	Look, look, look.
14753940	14755940	There's party hats if you want to put them on
14755940	14757620	because it's a party.
14757620	14760140	Oh, look at the box coming over from the main.
14760140	14761500	Look.
14761500	14762740	Oh, there's a Santa hat.
14762740	14764980	There's a red party hat.
14764980	14766700	There's a white party hat.
14766700	14768420	Ooh.
14768420	14769820	And there's burnt fish.
14769820	14771900	Oh, there's one over there and there's a Santa hat.
14772100	14773260	Ready?
14773260	14774100	Whoa.
14775620	14777260	Thank you to ever drop them.
14777260	14779500	Oh, look, you're opening your party hats on.
14779500	14780500	Look at your party.
14782820	14785700	It's a party in the south of Lumbridge.
14785700	14786540	Yeah.
14788500	14789540	The little party hat.
14789540	14790540	Oh, look at you.
14790540	14791860	Go.
14791860	14793740	Go get your fancy party hats.
14793740	14794580	Look at yours.
14796860	14798300	What's up, party people?
14799060	14799900	Go.
14801380	14803260	Can we ask the chat to speak German?
14803260	14807260	I don't know if the bot filters are non-English words
14807260	14809180	because I've said it up as an English thing.
14809180	14811820	Why can't Mickey Mouse flying his plane to Scotland
14813500	14814900	at Disneyland?
14819740	14820980	You didn't know.
14820980	14823180	Just say it does not in Scots.
14823180	14825820	You say it does me.
14825820	14826820	I don't know why.
14827820	14830380	If I have to explain the joke because of flying,
14830380	14832420	how are Santa hats 16K?
14832420	14833740	I don't know.
14833740	14836060	Can't speak German and can't speak Dutch.
14836060	14837540	OK.
14837540	14839100	These puns were not I wanted.
14839100	14841180	I need a refund.
14845860	14846900	He, he, he.
14846900	14848220	That was good, actually.
14848220	14849060	I'll give you that one.
14849060	14850060	I'm giving you that one.
14850980	14855980	Yeah, I don't know what the bot does and doesn't like
14858580	14860940	in terms of TTS at the moment.
14860940	14862660	OK, we're definitely fishing a lot.
14864740	14868860	Where is my refling for sexy fire making?
14870660	14872460	I would like to summon one fire please.
14872460	14874260	I'm going to dance until the fire appears.
14874260	14875100	OK, let's dance.
14875100	14877340	Hey, hit him with the spin, hit him with the spin.
14877340	14879820	Hey, little Irish jig.
14880820	14882460	Hey, hey, hey, stop, stop, stop.
14882460	14883300	Head back.
14883300	14886700	Hey, hey, hey, get him with the yawn.
14886700	14889140	That does not look like a yawn.
14889140	14889980	Yeah, really?
14889980	14892820	Strongy, you are my leader, Schmetterling.
14892820	14897580	Leader Schmetterling, but is Schmetterling in English?
14897580	14898580	What is Schmetterling?
14898580	14899940	Is that called fishing?
14899940	14901460	Is that called fishing German?
14901460	14902300	Is that what it means?
14902300	14903900	Thank you for the tip, Iron Reaper.
14905940	14906940	A butterfly.
14906940	14908940	Hi, hi, hi.
14908940	14911260	I'm here to the butterfly.
14911260	14913180	Please make a move.
14913180	14915860	Put the colors in the sky.
14915860	14917340	Ah, hee, hee, hee.
14917340	14918060	Where's fire?
14918060	14919060	Right, I'll go get a fire.
14919060	14919620	Don't worry, guys.
14919620	14921460	I'm on the fire.
14921460	14922740	Oh, wait, I found the fire.
14922740	14923260	I'm blind.
14923260	14923820	I'm just blind.
14923820	14924780	I need my glasses on.
14924780	14925940	Sorry.
14925940	14927900	Sorry, there's a fire down here.
14927900	14929740	Sorry.
14929740	14931220	Hey, strongy, do you have a party hat?
14931220	14932460	I have an extra one.
14932460	14938900	I have, sorry, to, you know, kind of flex on the peasants,
14938900	14945020	but on my head is gold in crusted chef's hat.
14945020	14947620	I must stick to my gold in crusted chef's hat.
14947620	14949620	Thank you very much for your offer.
14949620	14950380	Super kind.
14950380	14952820	You know, I don't want to flex on them peasants below me,
14952820	14960420	but I'm kind of styling with the combo of gold apron and gold hat.
14960420	14962260	Wouldn't be super awesome if the player entered
14962260	14966260	the group and discovered the shroom thingy to come here.
14966260	14968940	If I play, oh, like someone just joins along.
14968940	14972380	Well, I don't know if you're, we told some, they were like,
14972380	14973180	what's going on?
14973180	14975420	And I was like, oh, some cringe VTuber's shroom in.
14975420	14977220	And they were like, I'm world hopping.
14977220	14978940	And I was like, OK, thanks for announcing it.
14978940	14981700	Literally, no one cares, thanks.
14981700	14986980	Am I level, am I level 19 still?
14986980	14990940	I am like two fishies away from 20.
14990940	14993900	And then we're going to move to Barbarian Village,
14993900	14996940	which is west of the Grand Exchange.
14996940	15000460	Strona has power to actually do it in crusted chef's hat.
15000460	15002260	Weird flex.
15002260	15003700	That happened to me in Final Fantasy.
15003700	15005060	Our Marshmallow is anonymous.
15005060	15007220	Yes.
15007220	15010740	If you have Firefox, it might be able to translate the screen
15010740	15011620	automatically.
15011620	15016620	Sometimes it doesn't, I don't know why.
15016620	15021420	I am going to make another cup of tea.
15021420	15022740	Hop on strunnies.
15026740	15029300	I'm going to make another cup of tea,
15029300	15031540	because my voice is absolutely feeling it.
15031540	15034980	What do you mean doing multiple 12-hour streams back to back
15034980	15036340	is straining on the throat?
15036340	15038300	Oh, it says 10.
15038300	15042220	Is that like a RuneScape, like Congrats 10 Balloon?
15042220	15043100	I saw that.
15043100	15044780	Wait, hold on, let me make the, look.
15044780	15047180	Oh my god, he's getting performance anxiety making that
15047180	15047700	fire.
15047700	15049500	Look, it's a 10.
15049500	15050860	He must have got it for 10.
15050860	15052500	Oh, you don't look at your shirt.
15052500	15056260	What is, it's like the logo.
15056260	15058380	Let me zoom out a little bit.
15058380	15059660	It was the 10th anniversary.
15059660	15060700	How old is this game?
15065260	15066580	There's too many people.
15069420	15070260	Another cup of tea.
15070260	15074380	You mean a cup of tea for the non-endurance stream, right?
15074420	15077660	Yeah, surely, as I say, on the four-hour mark,
15077660	15080180	and we're not even like level 20 in cooking.
15080180	15082300	Yeah, not an endurance stream at all.
15085420	15088180	Google Chrome apparently translates Marshmallow as well.
15088180	15090820	But now if I send the Marshmallow, you'll know it's me.
15090820	15095220	No, actually, because I'm not opening them up right now.
15095220	15099460	And for some reason, Marshmallow puts like five questions
15099460	15102380	from like loads of different times together at once.
15102420	15103540	It doesn't make any sense.
15103540	15104620	I don't know why I'd pass it.
15109340	15111340	Send the most horrendous cringe Marshmallow
15111340	15113660	and sign your name on the bottom like a gigatad.
15113660	15117540	I played when I was five on my older brother's account.
15117540	15119780	Oh, did he like force you to go questing?
15119780	15121100	That's funniest, anything.
15123540	15125620	This isn't RuneScape, huh?
15128620	15130660	It's old-school RuneScape.
15131540	15132820	Oh, no.
15132820	15134300	We're getting corrections.
15135980	15140980	Oh, wow, doing bot run on your brother's account.
15141220	15142060	For him.
15144540	15146060	Oh, I said RuneScape twice in the same sentence.
15146060	15146900	Oh, my God, cringe.
15147860	15148700	It's a cringe.
15148700	15149540	See about here.
15151300	15153100	You're in a level 14 fishing.
15153100	15154700	I mean, we're getting somewhere.
15156460	15159140	Oh, no, I think I might need PP bye-bye time as well.
15159220	15161660	Actually, yeah, a T and a P might.
15163100	15166900	But not the P and the P, but I need a P and a P in general.
15171940	15175540	Key quest is how often are these old-school rooms?
15175540	15177820	I was gonna do a few endurance streams.
15177820	15180980	I have no idea how long cooking takes.
15181980	15184180	So I was gonna do a few endurance streams of it.
15184180	15186140	I was gonna try and finish it in one month,
15186140	15190620	but I don't know if that's just being far too crazy.
15190620	15193660	Cut off fish, wrapper needs a T and a P.
15198300	15201500	On RuneScape, with a refunds, ptsu.
15201500	15204860	Doing nothing, ptsu, hunting for shrimp.
15204860	15207180	I can't rhyme, I can't do it.
15207180	15209580	I don't know how people do it at the same time.
15210860	15213660	You can reason why they get 9-9 cooking in less than 30 hours.
15213660	15215860	Okay, no, currently we're not maxing,
15215860	15217460	but I'll do, I'll do.
15218340	15219660	I'm gonna do that.
15224740	15226580	We did it!
15226580	15229140	30 hours of one tick-clicking.
15229140	15232180	Level 20 cooking.
15232180	15234060	Do we still burn shrimp on 20?
15235100	15238420	With Karab one.
15238420	15239820	Karab one's a real thing.
15241020	15242460	Am I being pranked?
15242460	15245060	I don't think you burn after level 20!
15246740	15248660	A reefling check.
15248660	15250740	For those of you who are on a fresh account,
15250740	15252100	what level are we looking at?
15252100	15253620	20 as well?
15253620	15254580	You guys, 20?
15255940	15258740	Karambuaz.
15258740	15261460	Oh, she sees, okay, you're done.
15264500	15266580	I've got 21, I've got 23.
15266580	15267940	How are you all faster than me?
15267940	15269860	Okay, we'll go a little reefling.
15271220	15275060	Okay, what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna do a P and a T,
15275060	15275900	a classic.
15278020	15280660	And we will be back.
15280660	15282100	Hi, how's the runescaping?
15282100	15283460	We're doing good!
15283460	15284660	If you ever wanted to join in,
15284660	15287060	we're on World 3A top right there.
15288100	15290100	Why is my latest tipper not working?
15290100	15291620	It should be rotating right now.
15293220	15294660	Sorry, latest tipper.
15298180	15301460	And then we're gonna move to Barbarian Village next
15301460	15303140	and we're gonna see what happens.
15303140	15303780	If there's...
15304900	15305940	Oh wait, no, we can't!
15310260	15314820	The problem is I don't want to mute the in-game chat
15314820	15315700	because of the bots.
15317060	15318900	I'm gonna go to bed, have fun cooking.
15318900	15320980	Ah well, thank you for everything.
15320980	15324020	Thank you for the extortionate prices,
15324020	15325780	for the shearers and all that.
15328420	15332740	I just realized we would probably have to fly fish
15333140	15334100	the fish ourselves.
15335780	15338260	Unless we went to the Grand Exchange,
15338260	15340980	but only I have accessed all the fish in my inventory
15340980	15342740	so it's not like we can share it out equally.
15346260	15348740	The bots on this world won't speak.
15348740	15350580	I mean, I can't, I just ignore them.
15351620	15353220	If we have to fly fish,
15353220	15356260	I think we need like level 20 fishing
15356260	15358020	so we would be here for a bit longer.
15358580	15363380	But rest well, there's reeflings that do need to sleep.
15363380	15365940	Yeah, we would need 20 for the trout.
15368340	15370100	Oh, sorry, I just like...
15370100	15372820	We need fish and wane.
15372820	15373940	Maybe we should pray.
15376180	15377540	But how can fish fly?
15377540	15378900	Are you telling me this fish flies?
15385700	15387220	I'm thinking, I'm thinking.
15388100	15390580	I'm not sure you guys want to be held here for another...
15391940	15395140	what hour until we get like the actual level needed.
15397940	15400980	I'm thinking, but my brain isn't really coming up with any solutions.
15400980	15401620	It's either...
15403700	15404820	Nah, there is no solution.
15404820	15407460	We have to keep being here until level 20 fishing.
15410340	15411540	And then we can move on.
15411540	15412900	It's going to be a long road either.
15412900	15415940	Well, yeah, literally if it takes 30 hours of matter,
15416900	15419940	like, are you telling me I shouldn't pray this fish?
15419940	15421860	Are you telling me I've cuddled this fish?
15421860	15422340	Yeah.
15422340	15426260	Um, if it's going to be a 30 hour stream anyway,
15426260	15427380	congrats on 20.
15428660	15430980	No questing for hourly levels suck.
15432820	15436820	Yeah, we're also pretty low on combat for fresh starts as well,
15436820	15437460	which is a bit...
15439860	15442340	And I don't know what we should do.
15443460	15445620	Are you telling me I cuddled this fish?
15445620	15446260	Exactly.
15447380	15448260	You can do...
15450580	15452100	Miss the mystery well here.
15452100	15453540	That quest is right here.
15453540	15454980	Oh, do we need...
15455860	15457380	Okay, how about that?
15457380	15460100	We go for a T and a P and we're gonna do some more questing
15460100	15462020	just to break up the fishing,
15462020	15464660	because that was quite a few levels we got with fishing.
15464660	15466180	So we'll go do some questing.
15467540	15471060	Um, and then it can be broken up a little bit,
15471060	15472740	because I don't want to like hurt you too much,
15473380	15474580	just doing it over and over.
15475620	15478420	Oh no, you mean we have to stay here and keep chatting forever?
15478420	15479300	I would hate that.
15479300	15479940	Oh, wow.
15479940	15480820	Oh, that would suck.
15480820	15481620	Yeah.
15481620	15482340	I'm glad.
15482340	15484020	I'm glad you enjoy my rambles.
15485060	15486580	But just as a reminder,
15486580	15491780	Emmy is live playing the coffin of Andy.
15491780	15494020	Congrats if your name's Andy and Lele.
15494020	15495940	Congrats if your name's Ashley or Lele.
15495940	15497620	Nickname is a Lele.
15497620	15502340	Um, then we are going to do a few more quests,
15502340	15504340	free quests just to break it up a little bit,
15504340	15508740	because I don't want you guys being bored of it or not.
15508740	15511380	But we will start the cooking grind soon.
15512260	15513060	Another 10?
15513060	15515220	The German name for cuttlefish is Tin Tin Fish.
15516500	15518740	A Tin Tin Fish?
15519700	15520820	A Tin Tin Fish?
15521620	15522660	Oh my gosh.
15522660	15523300	Okay.
15523300	15524820	Thank you for the tip, Iron Reaper.
15525700	15529140	The German name for cuttlefish is Tin Tin Fish.
15529140	15531060	How do I do it in a German at Haloloitad?
15531780	15532820	A Tin Tin Fish?
15533620	15535140	A Tin Tin Fish?
15535140	15536580	I can't do it.
15536580	15537620	I can't do it.
15538420	15541060	I can't break it.
15541060	15541620	Nine.
15542980	15544100	A Tin Tin Fish.
15544100	15545620	I am a big Tin Tin Fish.
15547620	15548660	I'm level.
15548660	15549540	Congratulations.
15549540	15551540	You reach a total level of 75.
15551540	15555220	Oh, I'm flexing on other RuneScape players right now with that.
15555220	15555940	Flexing.
15558340	15560660	Tin Tin Fish equals an ink fish.
15561300	15562900	Oh, that's such a cool translation.
15562900	15563700	So Tin Tin.
15564500	15566820	Tin as in tint of a color.
15569060	15570580	And it's ink tin.
15570580	15572180	And so it means tinted fish.
15572980	15574340	The tint of the ink.
15574340	15575060	Oh, that's so cool.
15577540	15578900	Wah, why did I stop cooking?
15580500	15582900	I wish I was that high level, sad face.
15583780	15584900	He says no one feel well.
15584900	15587300	He's probably billions of levels higher than us.
15588980	15589700	Tin Tin Ink.
15590660	15591700	Oh, my God.
15599780	15600100	Okay.
15601220	15604660	I am going to go make a tea and pee whilst I fish.
15605620	15607940	Hopefully this fishing spot doesn't despawn.
15607940	15609300	And then we're going to do a quest.
15609300	15609540	Okay.
15609540	15611780	So I'll be back in like three minutes now.
15611780	15612100	Okay.
15612660	15614020	Give me three, three.
15614020	15614980	Oh, excuse me.
15614980	15616660	That was a McDonald's bag from yesterday.
15616660	15618740	I do apologize if you heard that picked up in mic.
15619220	15620420	Yes, yes, yes, yes.
15620420	15620740	Okay.
15620740	15621300	I'll be right back.
15621300	15622180	I'll be three minutes.
15622180	15622740	Pea and a tea.
15622740	15626420	Please get up and stretch and get some water or hydration or anything.
15626420	15627860	Of course that freaking despawns.
15627860	15628500	How dare you.
15629380	15631860	Disrespect I've been shown by this fishing spot.
15633220	15634740	You got Mickey D's yesterday.
15634740	15635780	Well, okay.
15635780	15636020	Right.
15636020	15636820	I very quickly go.
15636820	15638100	I'll be as quick as I can.
15638100	15638340	Okay.
15639460	15641300	Wait, do I need to cover the screen?
15641300	15641860	I don't know.
15641860	15644180	I don't think I have to, but yeah.
15645060	15645940	Just in case.
15645940	15647060	So you see my email.
15649540	15650340	I'll be three minutes.
15650340	15650580	Okay.
15650580	15650740	I was.
16009700	16014500	Hey.
16014500	16020660	Why?
16020660	16025300	My throat hurts so much.
16025780	16026100	Okay.
16026660	16028340	I can do too long when I go.
16030820	16031380	Pee, pee.
16031380	16031620	Wait.
16031620	16032500	Why he's greeting.
16034220	16036260	Wait, what do you mean disconnected?
16036260	16037620	I'm not disconnected.
16037620	16039620	Wait, why are you greeting? What are you saying?
16040960	16045900	She loves us. What? I never said that, didn't I? Because I went for a Tinko.
16047340	16049340	You have 30 days.
16049860	16054820	She's back. Quick, hide the memes. What were you doing while I was away? I've been away for a few minutes.
16055980	16062260	How was the pee? It was not a lot of liquid again, and I've literally finished a bowl of water.
16062740	16067380	So, and I had a tea, and I finished a can of cola. I've got another bottle of water here.
16067380	16070740	I don't know if you can hear my nails kind of against it.
16070940	16074500	I'm gonna try and finish that and the tea. I'm not really sure what's going on.
16076820	16081420	Um, I'm being pranked. I've been pranked by my body.
16082140	16085420	Wait, why does someone say she doesn't love us? Heart eyes? What?
16087780	16089780	By the way, reeflings are the best.
16090660	16097740	You say Coca-Cola. I hear burps. Cola burps. Cola burps. We did kiss the homies.
16098260	16104380	Uh, don't tell Amy that. She'll be jealous. I'm freaking, wait, I just caught an anchovy.
16105140	16107140	What does it do?
16108980	16111940	Oh, wait, I'm now catching anchovy because I'm a level?
16113140	16117740	Oh, maybe that'll speed up the fishing level gain. Okay, I didn't know that.
16119940	16124900	You put anchovies on a pizza. I don't think I've ever tasted that before. Burps.
16125540	16131300	Oh, I was so proud when Shabee started burping in her streams. I was like, oh my god.
16132420	16134580	My literal daughter. Oh my god.
16135940	16141300	With all the tea she drinks, Johnny will be really so fish-ticated.
16145780	16147780	That's not bad.
16148020	16150020	The burps are hot.
16151460	16157700	I don't understand the appeal of it, but then someone said, think of it about after the aftermath.
16160100	16164820	Give your run air back, I have no idea.
16167860	16171380	We get to rate more mouth pranks. Mouth pranks?
16172340	16178020	Why do you keep on firing as I knew that's why there's a freaking fire?
16179060	16183460	I'm getting pranked by the spine. Oh, I'm still burning stuff. I'm not level.
16183460	16187940	I'm, yeah, literally cooking level 22 and I'm still burning.
16188740	16192900	That's pretty rough after the mess. It's taking us a hot second.
16194260	16199540	Right, so what fishing level do we need? We need fishing level 20.
16202340	16207300	Shabee made a burp speed. She's indeed Shiba-kana-bama. Exactly. That's what I thought.
16209300	16212180	Tea bag in the fire. It's Johnny I kneel.
16213060	16216020	I guess so many things like, oh, I kneel for all the choices.
16216900	16222100	The barbed village spot has a permanent fire to cook on. Oh, right. I'll put my tinderbox and axe away.
16223940	16226980	And then we will buy fishing gear.
16227700	16235140	We farm until 20 fishing. I didn't know that. Yeah, we're going to do 20 fishing and then we're going to buy rods
16236020	16238180	because some of us don't have that attachment.
16238900	16246180	And then we get to go to a barbarian village and we fish and we just keep doing that for a while.
16246900	16254020	I think maybe we could get 40 doing that because salmon. However, the problem is the cost of feathers,
16254100	16259700	but the problem's already been solved thanks to reeflings literally giving me an insane amount of in-game currency.
16260500	16267860	Um, oh no, we're doing a quest. I completely forgot. I apologize. We are fishing level 20 fishing
16267860	16271620	and then we're going to do a quest that's right here that begins with M. We're going to do maybe
16271620	16276180	three quests just to break up the little fishing segment a little bit. It's called
16276260	16284740	Mithylin mystery. Mithylin mystery. Burps are saying you have relaxed come from around someone. I am
16286660	16290420	some people like get taught it's really rude manners. Like obviously it's rude like you wouldn't
16290420	16297380	be in a job interview and burp in there. Actually, speaking of burping in job interviews, I'm like
16297380	16302820	90% sure I accidentally burped when I was interviewing one of the girls revealer now that I think about it.
16303700	16309540	Uh, absolutely mortified on it. I think it may have been in me. You know that. No, it could not
16309540	16314580	have been in me. I think it may have been Mercy. Someone I burped and I was like, oh my god, I'm so sorry.
16320260	16323140	Did you hear about the telling chef who died? He passed away.
16323460	16329140	Oh, that didn't go that didn't go down well.
16331540	16338580	32. I think to stop burping burning shrimp level 32 you stop burning shrimp. That's insane.
16338580	16345460	Brian, Stroney, I hope you're proud. I was reading a comic earlier and all I heard was your voice.
16345540	16351700	I'm so cooked. Are you? Oh, did that actually happen? Am I in your head? Thank you.
16353860	16356500	Am I in your head? Is my accent in your head?
16369220	16374260	Okay, hopefully that hypnosis that reverbs off on the mic because I actually don't I didn't
16374260	16376020	say a thing that tells me if it's on or not.
16380100	16387140	Always in your head. Soon world domination, soon the first 99 cooking, okay.
16388340	16390820	It's more attractive if someone doesn't care about it.
16393540	16401860	Giving my woods the third group. What? Who? Who is Riefling is this? Come get your Riefling.
16402420	16407700	You've been in my head for a long time, Stroney. Cryo Freeze Momentum.
16408580	16412660	See, Stroney, that's why I didn't want the undo button. I want an undo button.
16413300	16419380	Right, I'm definitely cooking fish a heck of a lot faster now. Catching fish, my apologies.
16420260	16422260	She's not cooking.
16430580	16439380	We need to video game OST ranking. Okay, that slightly slows down progress now that we're
16439380	16445300	also getting anchovies as well. I keep actually trying to use fish on people. I've literally
16445380	16449700	slapped so many Rieflings with shrimp right now and feel really bad.
16450740	16455060	People are like touching your legs with my shrimp. I'm like, please take my raw shrimp.
16455060	16460980	At 21, I can finally churn cream, but we all churn cream together at the same time.
16466820	16473300	If you look at it, it's kind of like a cute little fishing camp, so Riefling's on.
16475540	16485140	There's a place to churn cream and lump. Wait, we can actually do it?
16487140	16491460	Hey, I thought we had to wait for another set for doing that. Honestly, right by Farmer
16491940	16495700	I don't even know you can churn, but take it. Take my raw shrimp.
16506020	16510820	I'm really happy that you said you love Germany. It's the first time we've worn something.
16511780	16519220	Deutschland Uber alles! Deutschland Uber alles! There you go. That's like all the German I could
16519220	16523540	come up with. Just Deutschland Uber alles. Thank you for the tip ironing river.
16525940	16531940	Wait, I don't know why. Nope, that wasn't it. Don't do that again. Why?
16536020	16538900	Hold on. I'm going to try and I don't know why it doesn't like that.
16539380	16542180	I don't know why it's frozen.
16546900	16550900	I'm so sorry. My little scroll and don't know things frozen. I'm gonna have to fix that next thing.
16552100	16555700	Well, no way you can say that. Wait, what does Deutschland Uber alles means?
16556980	16560500	Wait, if I just said something really bad, I thought it meant like Germany number one,
16560500	16565380	like China number one. What did I just say in German?
16565780	16568740	Did I just say something really bad?
16570900	16576100	I thought it meant China number one, but German number one. What did I just say?
16583140	16585940	Did I just say something really bad? It sounds like...
16586260	16594580	No, it's fine, but it can be associated with other stuff. I am so sorry.
16596580	16598660	Bitter. I am so sorry.
16602500	16610500	I thought it meant China number one. Let's just forget about it. I am so sorry. I genuinely
16610500	16613860	thought it meant China number one, but Germany number one.
16616900	16622580	When you learned your German from college, it's unironically like... Oh my God,
16623620	16627620	absolute idiot. I'm so sorry. I do apologize for that.
16629940	16634820	It's the first line of a national anthem. Oh wait, it's the first line of the national...
16634820	16635940	German national anthem?
16639380	16643460	It's only problematic if you use in a specific context. Oh, okay.
16645060	16650260	Shawnee, tomorrow will start to pop out strange fan art of you in a strange and nostalgic outfit.
16657860	16662340	Just remember, I don't own rights to previous things. That's what you're gonna...
16662820	16667220	I might not be able to interact with it if you're maybe getting a bit too cheeky.
16668180	16673620	Yeah, their national anthem from 1930s. Wait, no. I'm sorry. I really didn't...
16674260	16677540	Which Germany... Oh God, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
16680660	16684660	Genuinely thought it meant China number one. I don't know if you guys ever played
16685300	16693620	PubG or something, Pub Newgrounds or whatever. But everyone used to come in and go China number one,
16693620	16699060	and that was basically what I thought I just said, but I did not say that at all.
16702020	16705460	Don't worry, I'm new here. How do I find where you are on the map?
16706740	16711540	So when you open up map, you will start here right outside of Lumbridge,
16712500	16719140	or maybe you started at the quest guy. He's literally right here. You want to go south,
16719140	16723300	you can always use this cross here and click it, and it will make everything north,
16723300	16729060	like north point north, and then just come south through a graveyard, and we are literally all here.
16730420	16735620	So south through a graveyard and south again. Brian!
16735620	16738900	My heart just dropped in my pants as you just said that.
16738900	16743460	I'm so sorry. I didn't... I genuinely didn't know what it meant. I do apologize.
16744660	16747860	I thought like... I thought everyone was like,
16747860	16752420	yay, because I said Germany number one, and there's a few German watchers,
16752420	16757700	and no, I'm just an idiot, so yep, there's that. Apologies. Sorry.
16758420	16761380	Thank you for the tip. I do apologize.
16763860	16769140	Ah, cringing at myself. I'm like, oh, maybe I should cut that segment out of the void,
16769140	16774580	honestly. I don't want anything happening, like anything weird happening. Don't stress about it.
16775780	16776980	Okay, I'll try to get there.
16781700	16786340	I can't stop laughing. No, I don't laugh at me. Literally, anyone got a fire? Any fire?
16787860	16791300	Yeah, probably take that out. I want to ask, how are you already so good at this?
16791300	16796500	I watched someone else try, and they only have two quests left in F2P, but still need attack.
16796500	16801540	Oh, I'm not good at the game. What? You were literally in it with us. I'm rubbish at the game.
16802660	16808820	Literally, we have one, two, three, four, and five. We have five quests done.
16808820	16814020	Oh wait, are you memeing? I watched someone try, and they only have two quests left into it,
16814020	16817860	but still need a taxi to Virok. Oh right, because I actually played the game.
16818500	16827940	What's the timestamp? Hold on, four hours and like 38 minutes. Hold on, I need to make more of that.
16829540	16831460	Four hours, 48 minutes.
16832420	16846580	Oh, be oh my. Right, there we go, wrote a note. Then it gets chopped up.
16848420	16852900	We have another 90 levels of cooking in front of us. Don't let your...
16854260	16858340	your not... Sorry, the love heart's in the freaking way, in the way you do.
16858340	16860020	You're not Dutch knowledge to stop you.
16861700	16869860	Hello, ik ben een Nederlander, ik heb honger, ja. Ik wissen in das pond.
16871620	16877460	Only 13 million xp to go. No, no, no, cuddles, we're laughing with you. I was laughing at you.
16877460	16884660	Okay, okay. Relaxing stream. Okay, I'm glad you find it chill like that.
16888340	16894260	Sorry, I'm at the stage where I'm now cringing at myself, thinking I thought that meant Germany
16894260	16904020	number one in all the contexts that I'd ever seen that phrase. Anyway, I'm going to drink my tea,
16904020	16906980	and I'm probably going to cringe myself to sleep tonight.
16909780	16914260	Have you declared war to something with that sentence or opened a bakery for people?
16914740	16921380	Hopefully the bakery. You're fine. Oh no, is there fire maker going offline? I will make
16921380	16927380	us a fire, don't you worry. Come, let me go get a tree. I think there's a tree in the swamp
16927380	16934100	or something. Is there not a dead tree in here? Am I going crazy?
16936420	16940180	I could have sworn there's like a dead tree in the swamp that you can... Oh, there is.
16941140	16945860	I'm going to get jumped by a frog, but I'm going to be so quick. The frog ain't got time to attack
16945860	16953940	me. Oh, I'm full. All right, drop, take the tree, and then run all the way back to the reefing.
16954820	16960180	Oh, you made fire. Sorry. Oh my god, my wood cutting is so bad. It's going to take forever
16960180	16966020	to cut this tree. Okay, we did it, we did it, we did it. I have 50, not to brag or anything,
16966100	16968420	but I've got 50 XP and wood con.
16974100	16976900	Let's see. Okay, okay, we're back, we're back, we're back.
16988420	16994900	Just so you know, Germany number one means Deutschland of dying irons. Maybe next time.
16995460	17001540	Yeah, Deutschland, Deutschland of die irons.
17005060	17011380	We're learning who said streams and educate your man, huh? Get that on fire.
17015780	17023700	A whole 50, literally. Not to brag. What if you moved on to higher tier fish?
17023700	17027780	So we're currently trying to get fishing level 20, and then we're going to do some
17027780	17034740	questing just to get overall XP. And then we're going to move on to higher level fish,
17034740	17037860	just to kind of break up with a bit of fun questing in between.
17040900	17044980	I hope I don't pass out too early to the confidence of this company and me so hard.
17046740	17050500	Learning that Scottish Cut official of Germany, yes, this is educational content you should be
17050500	17051300	seeing on for.
17067940	17069380	By the Pope, I don't know for yourself.
17073380	17074580	Whoa, whoa, whoa.
17075860	17078500	No, no, no, no, no, no.
17080740	17090420	Thank you for the tip, iron reefer, hardy har har. No, no, bad Brian. Don't read that out loud,
17090420	17099620	Brian. That's naughty. It's naughty. There'll be no world wars. If anything, I'm actually a field
17099620	17107700	medic. So I'm here to stitch you up and give you all negative blood when you're perishing from blood
17107780	17116660	loss. That's literally bad boy, Brian, bad boy. Don't say that out loud. Oh my gosh.
17120340	17126260	No AI, the AI uprising. What's going on here? Oh, I'm itching my little schnozer. I'm going to
17126260	17128020	take a sip of my tea and see if it's...
17132420	17136740	Oh my god, it's the perfect sipping temperature, truly a British moment when you
17136820	17139220	enjoy when you appreciate the temperature of the tea.
17142900	17146980	Who are we on for fishing? Oh wait, I'm on 18 fishing. What are you guys on for fishing? We
17146980	17151460	must be getting close. We can do the quest very shortly. I'm going to put all of this in my bank
17151460	17159140	though. I am not questing with all of this money on me. Sorry, don't kill some of the money. I'm zero
17159140	17171460	negative life. The perfect cup of the perfect time, perfect dunking. Oh, what are they called?
17171460	17176420	Apparently custard cream's got named the best dunkable biscuit. Oh, you're lit. How are you
17176420	17182020	guys higher level than me, honestly? You're all cheesy, don't you?
17188340	17189780	Did the Scott have a British moment?
17192260	17195700	Unfortunately, I do seem to share some traits.
17197540	17202020	Can I even light logs or is it going to take forever? Because I'm such a low level in fire
17202340	17208580	making three, four. Oh, it took me four times. Honestly, that wasn't that bad.
17210180	17217700	15, but I had to step away a few times. Oh, you had to step away because my soundbore jokes were
17217700	17225700	just too good. Remember the one time when Facebook released an AI on the internet and
17225700	17229140	learned from the community that turned into the biggest thing going wrong?
17236100	17239380	Oh, it's four men in uniform to carry my little soldier home.
17240340	17247940	What should he do? Should have been a musician, but he didn't have the money for a guitar.
17248980	17255060	What should he do? Should have been a politician, but he didn't have a proper education.
17255060	17262340	This is not the song that I... Did we do it? We're almost there. We flings. We're so close to 20.
17263860	17268260	We're so close. By the way, do you have a plan for stages of cooking levels or would we do it
17268260	17276660	Chill and Spontane 99? I absolutely have no plan whatsoever. I've returned with logs for my fire duty.
17278500	17284500	I honestly have no plan whatsoever. We're going to move on to Salmon and Trout at
17284500	17290660	Barbarian Village after we do some questing. And then after that, I think it's just jugs of wine.
17290660	17294580	And we're literally going to be hanging out like maybe at the Grand Exchange on like a very quiet
17294660	17304180	server. Oh, level 19 fishing. There might be a quest we're going to...
17306500	17312500	Sorry for letting my inner German out, my quest. By the way, do you... Oh no. The fact that she didn't
17312500	17316100	correct the message does mean that she already chose to go straight to level 99.
17316820	17320580	Yeah, that's the plan anyway. We're going to do some questing just to break it up.
17320660	17330340	And then we are going to jump back into it. I want to see if maybe we could do level 40 today.
17330340	17334900	I don't think I'm going to do a full endurance stream as much as I love to harass you guys
17335860	17340980	and destroy your sleep pattern. I don't think we're going to do a full 12 hour stream today.
17342260	17348740	Also, my freaking VOD broke. Apparently the VODs break on 11 hours and 55 minutes,
17348740	17354740	not on the 12th hour. So the end of my VOD got chopped away and it just cuts off.
17356500	17366740	15 trout, 20 is... and 25 is salmon. Oh, we can make apple pies? Oh, I have a muffin!
17368340	17370660	I have an apple muffin. I forgot to eat it yesterday.
17371060	17379460	Yeah, something's like not really... YouTube VODs are on my list, especially the longer ones.
17379460	17385620	Yeah. Oh, is it displaying again correctly? Maybe it changed. Yeah, they told us.
17386740	17389780	That is a sad and frightening, so speaking super fast.
17393380	17397060	M&M's got nothing on me when I'm saying bioreflums. Okay, I'm like...
17401060	17406260	That explains why all the other VGVs stopped 10 minutes before the 12 hour mark.
17406260	17411460	Yeah, so unfortunately, we are having to bend the knee to the VOD overlords.
17411460	17415860	I wonder... I suppose they had to give a number, like it doesn't matter.
17418500	17426020	Circum... wait, I thought it said circumstance. Sure, you're not a mumble rat. Oh, I'm a mumble
17426020	17434660	rat. I can assure you that much. I'm annunciating my words right now. I'm annunciating. Any annunciators?
17440580	17441860	Oh, come on, catch that last one.
17444340	17453220	Anything to do with this inventory full of shrimp? Drop them! If you go, you cook them on the fire
17453220	17458740	and then you drop them once they're all cooked. It sounds like a decision made for some technical
17458740	17464500	reason over... Yeah, I assumed they had to put a number on it, but they couldn't just infinitely do it.
17466820	17471460	Although there's those accounts that used to infinitely stream music. Was it Lo-Fi Girl
17471460	17479620	or something like that? They just constantly keep going. I'll chug them all. If you go into
17479620	17485220	sentence, you can hit... I think it's like controls or something, and it's like use shift to drop,
17485220	17488420	and then if you hold shift, you can drop your full inventory stack really quickly.
17495860	17503140	Okay, level 25 cooking. I'll take it, like we're getting there. It's... if I could stop burning
17503140	17510500	this stuff, if we stop burning, we'd be like literally flying through the levels. Right, 20 is
17510500	17517220	maybe one more deck of fish away? Lo-Fi Girl never saved Vods and didn't let you rewind,
17517860	17524500	that could be why... We are learning. Okay, more of my tea. I keep forgetting.
17528660	17530420	And these fishes are hiding from me.
17533540	17540100	So I assume it costs money to get some of these Asterix costumes, because
17540900	17547140	these are like full of costumes. I have to go in 10 minutes. I can't stay on Firejoy forever. Yes,
17547140	17553060	that's okay. Don't worry, we can take over. We're probably doing by Quest next. But thank you for
17553060	17560420	your service. Wait, hold on. 07. Thank you for your service on Firejoy. 07. We salute.
17560740	17568180	Yeah, Wi-Fi... Lo-Fi Girl is more like a follower radio channel. Yeah.
17571460	17574340	The only MTX in Old School RuneScape is Bond.
17580020	17585060	You can stream them, stop, but when you end the Vod, it will only save the foot 11.55.
17585060	17594180	Hmm. Well, I'll need to know that for the Donathons, because Azuras is first.
17596340	17600820	20! I'm finally fishing level 20. That took so long.
17604580	17611940	I can drop them. Okay, we're level 20. We're gonna do questing once I finish this batch that I've got.
17612900	17617140	And then we'll go to the bank and drop off all our items and see what this Quest
17617140	17620420	mini thing is all about. I don't know if I need any items for it, is it this?
17621780	17624500	It began with an M, so let's scroll down to M.
17628100	17629460	Let's scroll up to M's.
17633700	17640420	Mystery. What do we need for that? We need... Oh, we get a reward. What do we need for it?
17640420	17648580	Recommended items, none. Enemies to defeat, none. Okay. Right. We'll definitely do this.
17649220	17654660	Nicely. Oh, she is right there. Okay, that makes perfect sense by that reefling. Suggested that
17655780	17662500	silly of me. If we're going to do some quests, we're going to the city, then we're going to the
17662500	17668500	city, then the door closes as well. Close pack. We're gonna put our items away first before we
17668500	17672100	continue with the questing. I actually have to go to... Don't worry if you have to go,
17672100	17677220	thank you so much reeflings for hanging. I appreciate it. I am going to try and get level
17677220	17683540	99 in one month for cooking, so there will be plentiful opportunities to come hang.
17684340	17689060	I'm also going to do it during the week instead of on the weekend as well to give
17690420	17696340	the people who work on the weekends a chance as well to come in and join in the fun.
17698500	17704660	Okay, everyone who is fishing, if you want to cook the fish, we're going to take it to the bank,
17704660	17709140	if you want to cook it the new, and then we're going to make our way to the castle, and then
17709140	17718580	we're going to come back and... Oh, my fire. My fire perished. So get cooking, good looking.
17719940	17727300	Oh wait, that's the song. Hey, good looking. What you got cooking? It's shrimp on a fire.
17727300	17734660	Shrimp on the Barbie. Oh, we're so Aussie out here. Can you go back to the mystery
17734660	17740420	area after you finish? Oh wait, should we just do the quest?
17743140	17746900	Reeflings have done the quest. Should we just do the quest now instead of going all the way back
17746900	17758820	in like here again? I finished my tea. Do they actually eat a lot of shrimp on Aussie land?
17758820	17762340	I don't know. Just do the quest. Okay, we'll do the quest.
17766340	17769860	I'll wait for everyone to finish up and do their thing, and then we'll start.
17770820	17776820	So let you guys cook. Those who are fishing, you can un-fish and cook, and then we'll start
17776820	17783380	with this quest, and we'll pick another one. We'll do three quests, I think. I either need to do
17783380	17791700	stream split recording. Yeah, for the donathons. I know you need to do back to back, so I'm actually
17791700	17795940	going to have to get like a video put together for Azura to play when she goes to sleep.
17795940	17801380	Hopefully her PC doesn't explode midstream. Should be a way to sleep in the thing just
17802500	17805060	catch some fire in the corner of the room, and she's like, okay.
17810740	17817300	We eat prawns. Are you squidding me right now? Who goes there, Brian? Do you read Patreon messages?
17818020	17822340	No, so none of the talents have access to Patreon messages because it's like direct
17822420	17828820	messages, so they don't have access to that stuff? No. So no, I read Marshmallows though,
17828820	17837940	your mother won't come to send a marchi. I'm drinking water now after finishing my tea.
17843140	17849060	Okay, is everyone almost ready? I'm gonna drop three inventory space. I'll just drop
17849060	17857140	three anchovies, why not? Right, we will talk to this lady. I'll put walking on. Let's see what
17857140	17868580	happens. Help, help! Start the quest. Sure, are you guys ready to come over? I'll get to 20 later.
17868580	17874820	Yeah, we can always come back and do our thing. Thank you for the tip though, Anonymous.
17875780	17879220	You really are shy. You could ask that for free. You didn't have to give me money to
17879220	17883460	ask that question. You guys are always welcome to ask and chat. I know it can be never again,
17883460	17887540	or you can ask in Marshmallow, but I might be sold to respond because I'm not reading Marshmallows
17887540	17893380	right now. Thank you for the tip, but save your money at the same time, seriously.
17894260	17901380	Ray, are we ready? Are you my refillings? You are. You're not quite ready, hold on. Oh, sorry.
17901380	17907300	Right, I'm accepting the quest. What has happened here? We were invited to a house party on the
17907300	17911060	island not far from here. Something felt wrong about the whole thing, but we went away. The
17911060	17914500	house seemed pretty creepy, but everything was going fine. We were having a good time,
17914500	17920660	and that's when we got attacked, and I tried to save her. Huey brought me enough time to find
17920660	17925860	an old bolt. I went back to get him, but it was too late. I'm scared he won't make it. You have to
17925860	17932340	do something. They can't get away with this. What do you want me to do? That cycle is still
17932340	17937220	out there. You have to bring them to justice. The boat we escaped on is just over there,
17937220	17942580	and you can use it to get to the island. Okay, I'll see what I can do. I need to fight, I hope not.
17943300	17945140	Can reflings see this boat over here?
17945380	17953540	Can you point in the way? Let's check that you're all here.
17954820	17960580	He's got a refling, got a few. Okay, end of the boat, end of the boat.
17962340	17966500	And joins. How bold of you, considering she has a plan. Stranny, I was wondering if you were
17966500	17972100	following some kind of, uh, gay deciding to do... Nah, I'm just going for it. We're literally doing
17972100	17976820	quest and right now, like I'm already getting distracted from the 99 grind.
17979460	17987220	Okay, I think that's all my reflings. These are actual plots. Okay, into the boat we go. Yippee!
17989060	17992420	There's a chance you ask the question and check out typically better chances, I don't know.
17993700	17998500	I know, but you still do it for free. Just like keep... Like if I miss it, then ask it again in
17998500	18004260	like a couple of minutes. Oh my god, there's so many of us doing this quest right now. We're
18004260	18012500	going to overload this. It looks kind of familiar. Ooh, where are we? Oh, okay, we need to take a
18012500	18018900	left refling. For those of you who don't have the plugin, we're going to pick up this bucket right
18018900	18024260	here on the left. Oh no, is it instance bucket? Why are we taking the bucket? Pick up from the bucket.
18024980	18030820	Is it an instance bucket? Oh no, we can all take it. Okay, that's good. Okay, drop.
18033700	18041540	Okay, everyone get a bucket. Pick up your bucket. Sits right by the fountain. Oh my god,
18041540	18051860	the beacons are lit. Gondor calls rage. Okay, and then we have the barrel of rainwater.
18051860	18057140	Interact with it. We need to search it. Okay, there's like lots of noises going on.
18059700	18069540	Whoa, party on, bro. Oh, it's like that movie that I've not seen. Whoa, the wind totally just felt like
18070100	18081460	some breathing on my neck. Oh, not cool, bro. I feel woozy, gurg. I see the light.
18083300	18089220	It's not my tame, glurg, glurgle, gargle. Oh, that's a bit. I don't know what movie he's from. I've
18089220	18096420	not seen it, but I've seen it. You know what I mean? I've not seen the movie. Help me.
18099700	18104500	Man, you're taking a while to perish. Sid collapses on the ground in a crumpled mess.
18104500	18109460	As he falls down, you spot something shiny fall out of his shirt pocket and into the barrel of
18109460	18117780	water. Gosh, that was horrible and so drawn out. Oh, wow, he's still going.
18121300	18125460	I think he's actually gone this time. Who are you? Why are you doing this?
18126180	18133220	Hmm, he didn't say anything. Scary movie. Oh, it's Scream. Oh, I've got to find a way
18133220	18139380	into that house and stop this maniac. I wonder what it is that I saw fall into that barrel.
18140660	18146260	Search the barrel, reflings. The barrel's full of rainwater. I can't see what's in there. Oh, right,
18146260	18151300	click on the barrel in your inventory and use it on the barrel of rainwater. You fill the bucket
18151300	18157220	from the barrel. Okay, now what? Now we search the barrel. You find a key at the bottom of the barrel.
18159140	18166020	Uh, are you seeing strong? Okay, now we go to the front of the house.
18170340	18175780	It's so scary. Oh, it's making the noises.
18176740	18184340	Chop down. No, open large door. Okay, here we go. The bunny went ahead. I saw that bunny.
18184340	18191700	He closed the door behind you. Let us in the house. Right, there we go. Oh, the door all closes. Hold
18191700	18197940	on. I think the door all closed. Oh, does it all close? Wait, I can't even get in. Is this open
18197940	18204420	large door? No. I think we're all trying to get in at once. Right, I'm not clicking it. I'm just
18205220	18213060	okay. Okay, hold on. Hold on. Oh, all right, I'm getting there. We're getting there. We're
18213060	18218340	getting there. We're getting there. Hold on. Hold on. Why am I not going inside? It's not
18218340	18223460	because someone's doing the door thing. It's one at a time. Right, okay, that's fine.
18225380	18230260	Okay. Oh, okay, I'm in. I'm in. I'm in. Okay. Oh, that took us a hot thing there. Right,
18230260	18236340	let's get the other refunds in. Everyone in. Everyone in. Okay, a few more. A few more
18236340	18243220	refunds. A few more stragglers. Can you come? Can you come? One more. One more. Can you come? Can
18243220	18249940	you come? Click that door? Right, we're in. We're in. Right, everyone, touch the table in the entrance
18249940	18258100	way. Oh my goodness. There's a knife on the table. Touch that table. Oh, we're touching the table.
18258740	18266740	Okay. Once you've touched the table, touch this door. Oh, the door. The door. Oh, cut scene.
18268180	18282580	Knock, knock. Who's there? Oh, no. Gurgle. Oh, he said you're next to me.
18282740	18290980	Oh, he's using cheat see doodles. What's this? A note. I guess I should read it.
18291940	18296340	Let's go get the note. Oh, he left the note. Okay. It should be a note to your left.
18296340	18302180	You take a copy of the note. Let's read it. Isn't murder just the work of art,
18302180	18307060	beautiful yet haunting like the blade of a knife as we wander through the valley of death?
18307060	18311220	Oh, spooky. Oh, okay.
18315460	18320740	Is this on the other side? Oh, okay. Everyone enter this room. It doesn't really look like a room.
18320740	18326740	Oh, it's a some room anyway. Oh, look at this painting. Wait, why am I getting turned this
18326740	18332580	way for the painting? Hello? Hello? Okay, examine painting.
18333380	18340020	Wait, what am I supposed to do? Oh, use the knife on the painting. I didn't
18340020	18343140	even know I had a knife on me. Use the knife in your inventory on the painting.
18344180	18349140	Beat that painting up. Show it. You mean boss. You slash open the painting revealing a hidden
18349140	18357620	storage compartment. Search painting. You find a key hidden inside the slash painting.
18357620	18363460	Okay. If you found your key, come back out into the entrance wave. You've got the key
18363460	18369460	from the painting by cutting it up into the entrance way. Okay, just a few more.
18370820	18373940	Use the knife in your inventory on the painting in that room.
18374740	18380260	And then once you've got the key, come back into the hallway. We're doing it. We're questing.
18381220	18386660	They have a higher pit than you. What's a pit?
18390820	18391380	Are we good?
18394180	18401620	There should be a knife in your inventory. And then you can highlight it by using right click
18401620	18410900	and then slash the shoes of it. There you go, you key. Alrighty. And then we go through this door
18410900	18421620	right here. Oh, there's a refund party in here, clearly. Oh, someone's spooking us behind the door.
18423460	18428020	Okay, once you enter this new room, there's a little Orbe thing to the left. I don't know what
18428020	18434420	it does, but it's highlighted. Examine the unlit candle on the wall. Oh, we're to tinderbox
18437220	18446500	the thing on the wall. Tinderbox the unlit candle. Oh, wait, do you guys need a knife for a tinderbox
18446500	18455940	or is it like in this room? Do you guys need me to trade this? There's a bunch in here. Okay,
18455940	18459700	okay, that's good. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, literally all on the shelf. There's a tinderbox
18459700	18464980	on the shelf if you need help. You light the candle. So light the two unlit candles. Oh,
18464980	18470580	there's a third one as well. Oh, excuse me. Excuse me, Mr. Video Game. Oh, I just touched my fish.
18470580	18478340	Hold on. Wait, that sounded odd. I think she's more happy of the fact that there's
18478660	18483700	20 people doing the same thing. Literally, Jagex is like, what on earth?
18485460	18488420	Ah, I'm sure they've had it before people go questing together.
18489460	18495220	You light the candle. The room is sufficiently warm. The fuse should now have dried out. Oh,
18498820	18501860	once you tinderbox all the things, do the barrel?
18502180	18509060	I don't know. And get the heck out of the room. Get out of the room as soon as you light that
18509060	18514100	thing. Hold on, let me run. Give me that room. Give me that room. Give me that room. Give me that
18516500	18521380	the thing about to blow. Oh, okay, okay, okay.
18524340	18529860	All right. Hey, it's the shadow one that kept closing the doors on me.
18531860	18536180	that's known or not, if this is in life, why are you so excited if I touch the doors and
18536180	18540660	tables? I'm just like it's so fun being like oh my god request them together and for those
18540660	18546180	who don't have room light I'm like I'm the quest teller you know so once you've let everything
18546180	18551300	and blew it up we can all go outside in this section so I'll wait for the reeflings to come over
18551300	18553780	yeah they're like having to get out the room because it's blowing up
18555860	18558340	I just find it really fun getting to play games together

20629660	20631820	me
20645740	20652460	right we're gonna go into the cows pen and we're literally gonna go nuts and destroy
20652460	20660780	and all these cows up ahead okay just so some people get nine in cooking by at skill 33 with
20660780	20666460	6000 grapes and turning them into wine is that the fastest ice pee maker i thought it was sharks
20666460	20672300	but sharks are expensive me oh someone wants to trade sorry sorry i didn't see the offer
20673580	20680060	what do you offer me poison are you telling me killing them oh my god what did you do poison
20680060	20690700	and fish food reef land that's so mean i got given poison and freaking fish food tell me tell
20690700	20696220	me you don't like me without telling me you don't like me reefland sheesh right let's absolutely
20696220	20704940	destroy these cows even if you just get a few like to level up i guess even a tiny bit of a level
20704940	20712700	up is better than nothing something about not being able to burn wine wine making is the fastest okay
20716860	20725180	based for reefling someone said okay just get the cows just attack the cows at all willy nilly
20726780	20732300	and then we can level up our combat a bit because our combat is so low that we're like
20732780	20738860	really vulnerable to pretty much anything destroy that reefland mods slap them silly
20740140	20744460	mods remove this man sis just call things
20747580	20754380	why are you following this noob just call things okay i love that answer is there more cows over
20754380	20760380	here oh there is there's like tons of cows okay and don't worry you can attack everything in this field
20762540	20764780	level up oh i said enjoy

20775420	20777660	mods make sure his pillow is always warm
20780300	20787740	yeah see we like literally already we're getting so strong we're just beating absolutely everything up
20788060	20796780	why did actually how did they know i'm a noob is that the way i dress i'm literally wearing
20796780	20802860	a thousand gold drip and they called me a noob not to brag but my combat levels five right now
20803420	20809500	like i'm sorry but but runescape players quake when they see me i'm sorry just quake when they
20809500	20815980	see me they can't help it their timbers are shivered whenever they see scottl fish login online
20816940	20820300	oh i've only got four health i should maybe be a bit more careful honestly
20822700	20826060	oh i've only got three health maybe i should be really careful uh
20827580	20835660	hmm i'm not sure i can maybe fight the baby cows if i get beaten up by a cow i'm gonna be
20835660	20842700	really embarrassed okay oh my god a baby cow destroy it combat level five literally
20842700	20847980	we quiver before you as well but for different reasons
20850620	20856460	oh my god the way that we think like rolls over as well it's so sad i'll plant some bums
20858220	20864940	all right i can only attack baby cows because i've only got three hp i swear if any reefling
20864940	20869500	perishes against cows i'm gonna be embarrassed for result okay oh sorry someone said they wish
20869500	20873260	to trade sorry sorry let me beat up this baby cow and then i'll accept the tree
20878380	20882380	oh my god i'm on one hp no way this baby cow is gonna get me mods
20886220	20892700	i need to get out of the field oh my god i'm one hp in a dream hold on right let's try that again
20893660	20898220	okay i literally i'm the one that's gonna perish from the cow hold on let me uh
20898220	20903660	accept this trade i was so sorry chin up offer
20905900	20913420	oh no can you not trade that's okay if you can't do it in time uh i guess we'll just hang about here
20913420	20919020	yeah we're just gonna hang about oh they're cooking meat cannot trade yeah i'm a new account it's
20919100	20926300	cause like i'm not cleared enough do you have meat excuse me little reefling uh can i get some of
20926300	20938060	your meat please one bit of meat so i can heal just one meat oh you not got any i saw you cooking
20938060	20947660	though i do not have any oh wait i can make some if i pick up some off the ground wait a minute
20947660	20954220	hold on a minute i can do it man i'm an independent strummer use the meat on the fire and then eat the
20954220	20961900	meat it's genius i did it okay we can go back to sleep and let's go we'll get a few more combat
20961900	20967820	levels like this chickens can only hit zero so that's good for you accounts now we need a challenge
20967900	20968460	for the coup
20974460	20977900	uh we're now attack level four oh my god we're getting so strong
20978780	20984860	they can't handle us when we enter the lobby i'm gonna actually cook again because i want to heal up
20987660	20994380	i'm gaming so hard right now oh no i burnt it oh i thought we were like high enough level
20994380	21004540	not to burn level on me honestly uh i don't know what combat level we are we're combat level five
21004540	21011980	surely that's enough for questing surely kopium let me know wild strongy can survive in nature
21011980	21019820	like it's rough out in in nature it's rough i just need to heal and then i can start walloping
21019820	21026700	everything again there boom uh let me keep them pack or is it better to like swap between like the
21026700	21039580	same thing so cows can burn it's genius why do the farmers randomly let you perish their cars
21039580	21048220	honestly i'm not even sure wait i think it might be faster to do like strength and then i might get
21048300	21052700	like a combat level faster i'm not sure if that's right though i could be completely wrong
21053420	21058540	about that wait there's like more cows over here we can just annihilate yeah there's like tons over
21058540	21070700	here best to train strength or maybe defense because like i've not got much hp points like
21070700	21075900	owl oh sorry someone wishes to trade with me drop some meat over here if you want a strongy
21075900	21083180	since i can't trade the reeflings feeding me oh they're feeding me thank you reeflings
21084780	21091820	that's a lot of meat jeez you're a packing is that six whole meat for me it is thank you
21092460	21098300	i'm a bite into it oh wait i'm already full health wait i only have nine hp or no i have
21098300	21106300	10 hp that's like tiny azura remainder azura duly is going live i i'm unsure what game she's doing
21108860	21113740	oh my god check out the outfit check out the drip let's say dripped out in the colors
21121100	21127900	we're getting there we're getting there surely and no freaking head bang oh my god you know
21127900	21132620	what that reminds me of i think the reason why i laugh so much at that is because of this
21133500	21138700	right hear me out hear me out where is it let me find it
21141260	21144940	i think that's why that makes me laugh so much because it looks so ridiculous
21145820	21149260	that's the only reason i think i like the head banging a moat the most
21149500	21153980	this is absolutely ridiculous
21160460	21167740	wow i don't know it's level six combat enough to like not get attacked all the time i look sucky
21168540	21172940	sorry i look sussy sorry i didn't mean i said that wrong i didn't mean to say it like that
21173660	21179820	oh i'm level two strength check me out oh sorry someone wants to trade with me
21179820	21185900	i'm sorry i missed it i'm sorry i'm too i'm too fatigued too fatigued i'm too enthralled
21185900	21192620	with perishing these cows to get some level ups very be sucky i'm sorry look i've got things on my
21192780	21197740	mind you know the marshmallows i've been getting recently oh yeah
21202940	21212220	okay accept trade what show me what you got oh it's a strength potion and cooked salmon
21213740	21218460	okay i don't know how long i only wanted to be here for like a wee bit and then we'll
21218700	21224220	straight back in to leveling up cooking because i'm like accidentally save questing a little too
21224220	21229580	much what i wanted to do was get some level so when we do airness to chicken we don't all perish
21229580	21234140	i think we can run a wave for whatever is going on oh yeah you know all right
21236700	21241340	um i just didn't want us to perish really quickly when we did airness to chicken
21242140	21250460	i don't know what is there is live with um thank you very much we fling for all the food supplies
21250460	21260860	as well um oh what almost like up my strength level up level up combat level six unstoppable
21260860	21269020	truly unstoppable they cannot they cannot strength potion for stronger uh okay i took a sip i took a
21269020	21275980	sip everything's gonna i don't know how long it lasts wait where's the effect i don't know how long
21275980	21284700	these things the pots last i've kept up this much of a fight i fear what bills are capable
21284700	21292780	she can now destroy baby cows with ease i truly am evil truly i don't know how long it was
21293180	21300860	yeah strength potion yeah top left the fist so strength boost
21303820	21311020	60 seconds no it does not last six seconds that's so small when you heal
21311740	21316300	oh salmon heals a lot actually we need to start like a salmon ring
21317660	21322140	is it normal to heal multiple multiple strong voices simultaneously in my head i hope not
21322140	21330700	if i left the echo on one boosted start point drains every 30 seconds that's so quick
21333260	21342540	oh i'm no strength level four i'm rolling these coos there's no echo okay it's just a reef flings
21342540	21348860	finally losing the plot oh i now can have a live in hp okay maybe we should have done a bit of
21348860	21354380	training a wee bit earlier but look we're leveling up that's the main thing we're getting there
21355420	21359820	i don't know if we should maybe go for like five
21363100	21368220	hmm echo isn't on i think he's just becoming extra strongy pill so it depends on how strongly
21368220	21375020	your potion is supposed to do as there is playing one shot like how strong he sends excited every
21375020	21380780	time she unlocks levels it's so satisfying it's like oh you've unlocked a new level but yeah i have
21381820	21386060	i'm such a big girl i'm so smart it's in my tea
21389660	21390620	hydration check
21395500	21399420	i think the echo effect if i was playing a video game doesn't sound that good like
21399980	21403980	this is for example what would sound like like oh i'm just killing this food right now
21403980	21408700	and it just sounds mental it sounds like you've lost the plot fine uh you've actually lost the plot
21410140	21414540	it's not it's not sounding good you know there that should be it back to me
21415900	21421740	i think i got an unsubtremisors channel it's very plausible everyone's youtube links should be in
21422700	21430860	my description right we'll do five defense we're almost level seven combat let's go
21430860	21434380	oh my god serenity

21470860	21478940	questing because someone might fall down uh what level is your attack my attack is four strength is
21478940	21484860	five and defense is one i'm currently doing defense right now uh just to try and get overall

21579100	21584460	oh i've reached a total level of 100 ooh our accounts are getting better
21585100	21593260	yeah we've started on fresh accounts so all that go censored it did hold on let me eat a salmon
21595100	21602220	well we're at combat level seven oh we are getting potent okay anyone look polygon that's what i mean
21602220	21609900	yeah polygon but if anyone looks as funny i'm gonna get them level seven go and get them
21610620	21617660	they can't handle they can't handle it lara croft polygon chest honestly
21620140	21624460	okay think we're getting there we're getting there maybe we do five on each
21625900	21631260	eight combat means we can survive a little bit of a hit a little bit of a punch if you will
21632220	21635100	triangle oh that should be
21642620	21646060	and then wherever erin is chicken starts i'm actually unsure
21649340	21656220	wow level four did i put my combat we're at seven point six for combat i like how it shows you the
21656220	21660700	increment as well like to be like you're getting closer i'm pretty sure prayer counts to your
21660700	21670460	overall combat level as well so i fonder the triangles um so i don't know if we should do some
21670460	21676380	i've never done is it the altar it's like dragon bone altar run but they're so expensive
21676940	21679820	and i would need personal guards like all the way over
21683420	21688140	see that's the fastest way to level up prayer i believe but yeah
21688140	21694780	yeah watching stroney and emean spritz playing a game on my own almost feels like a friend
21694780	21701580	isn't there no sensory overload doing that i feel like i'd be like i couldn't handle it

22822700	22826220	Um, there's a spade inside as well. Just woke up. How's runescape going? It's going good
22826940	22833580	Um, sadly my voice can't keep up. This is when I get really frustrated for streaming. I could happily stream 12 hours right now
22834540	22840780	But it really hurts. Um, okay dropping some poison and fish food. Okay. We'll wait until it looks up
22841660	22843660	um

22853820	22856300	What do you mean? This is a baby stream for me. Are you joking me?
22856780	22862220	Literally a two-hour stream, which is like the average for a vtuber is like a millisecond in my time
22863820	22867340	Like oh, I feel so bad. I'm only going to stream eight hours today. Ah
22868940	22872460	I mean, what do you mean? I got to play a multiplayer game with quite
22873020	22876940	Literally like how freaking blessed is it to be able to put a multiplayer game
22877500	22885660	With reeflings live whilst we're having a carry-on just memin about freaking doing head bang in like I've been dripped out
22885740	22888460	I've been getting like gifts and stuff people giving money like
22889260	22894620	I'm it's it's not a job. Like I'm this is fun. Like I'm having so much fun
22896300	22901500	Oh, I wish there was some sort of secret to like fixing like my voice from vocal strain
22901660	22904700	But the sad secret is it's literally just shot up stop talking
22906060	22908060	Oh, which is so annoying
22909180	22913020	Better to end early than strain your throat. I mean, it's already strained right now, but uh
22913580	22921500	What do you mean multiple to ever talking yapping sessions honestly, so she happy happy up. Oh my god, a little spooky boy

22936860	22941500	I'm waiting for the fish food to load so the others can grab it back. I don't see it loading
22943420	22948860	Having so much fun just hanging out the reef limbs have all the quests done over it. No, the quests are not done
22948860	22952460	Please don't worry. We're doing the free quest. Erin is the chicken at the moment
22952940	22957900	We've done a hand. Oh god my biggest forehead in the way. Hold on. Let me just close this for a second
22958380	22962220	Here is all the quests we've done. So free quest. We've done cooks assistant
22962620	22965260	We're doing air big air nice the chicken right now
22966140	22968140	We did the mystery
22968620	22972780	The restless ghost Romeo and Juliet sheep shearer X marks the spot
22973100	22979100	We're finishing Erin is the chicken and then we're going back to update it. Sorry to grind on our cooking stats
22980220	22986780	Can't expect you to do constant endurance streams day after day. Sadly. I hate it. I don't like doing short streams
22986860	22988860	I just feel so like
22989580	22991580	I don't know what the word is like
22992060	22995340	I have been yearning for this day
22996300	23001980	For an entire year like for this time. Sorry not for this day in particular, but for this time
23003500	23005500	um, and it's just like
23006860	23012940	It's frustrating that the only reason I can't stream more is because of my voice and not because like I'm tired
23012940	23017740	Or I don't feel well or I don't want to type thing. It's frustrating. It's my voice
23018700	23024940	That's it. That's the only reason I can't stream like for long because it hurts. It hurts to talk right now
23026300	23028700	Uh Jesus, you haven't seen the whole song
23030940	23032940	Try to live up to the name, you know
23034380	23038860	Uh, I asked for a little bit off the top. Hey, yo, who's the barber?
23040220	23043740	Man, we gotta go both. Okay. The poison isn't loading on the floor for me
23043820	23049500	But I think we'll do it. So as long as you guys have accepted the quest, we're gonna go inside now refling
23049740	23055660	It's taking nice and slow. I think the trees hit you on the way past. So just be careful
23055660	23057660	You don't stray from the path too much
23058060	23061100	Assume we're supposed to go. Ah the tree freaking went for me
23061820	23063820	Open large door

23136460	23142140	Nothing's being highlighted for me ruin light. You're failing me. Am I supposed to hear talk to the professor?
23146060	23148060	Be careful
23148300	23149740	Brian
23149740	23156540	It frustrates you because you can't control it and that's the most frustrating thing not being able to control something
23157420	23163260	Thank you iron weeper for the tip and yeah, just like uh really is telling you to use
23166060	23170780	All right hold on oh no, I'm mixing up hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on

23178780	23179780	that out.
23179780	23180780	What would that say?
23180780	23185740	Roonlake is telling you to use your poison on your fish food, okay, okay I have poison
23185740	23189780	fish food, right now I won't.
23189780	23193380	Just hypnotize yourself, Strony trust me I love you and enjoy every second but your health
23193380	23194380	doesn't pour in.
23194380	23198100	Yeah, like as long as my voice doesn't break then I'm good to go.
23199100	23207100	Where, where is this freaking map telling me to go, I'm so good to go, I wanna go.
23207100	23212100	We were to go outside, oh right okay.
23212100	23216100	Oh no sorry, close the map, not close one's view.
23216100	23226100	Right, so go downstairs, okay, come downstairs, poison the fish food and then come back out
23226100	23228100	of the mansion.
23228100	23234100	Okay, oh this is a rough one to do together I think so if you've not got it.
23234100	23241100	The door won't open over here, oh okay okay okay, how do I get over there?
23241100	23245100	Wait open the door, the chair beating you up?
23245100	23248100	Oh no they just run around, I thought the chair was like beating you up in the game
23249100	23258100	Oh there's a rubber tube, I get it, get the gauge in the tube.
23258100	23263100	Oh my god, open the door, what's that?
23263100	23267100	Oh I'm actually kinda scared of that.
23267100	23272100	Wait I can't go in, the door's locked, oh right okay.
23272100	23277100	Someone's dropped a speed ahead if you need it by the way.
23277100	23282100	We're taking the long way around.
23282100	23286100	Okay I'm glad the chairs don't beat you up because honestly death by chairs is pretty embarrassing.
23286100	23293100	Right open the door, or I'm gonna throw rocks through your window.
23293100	23299100	Open the door, okay so one by one door but we need to get the key first.
23299100	23306100	Well she's a stubborn one but I guess she's up till the day she can take care of herself to some fish so hard.
23306100	23312100	Okay okay we're now outside, this is a very hard one to follow quest-wise.
23312100	23317100	Especially if you're at a rune-like, rune-crafting guild, stop.
23317100	23323100	Are you telling someone that we're rune-crafting guild?
23323100	23330100	Okay I'm just follow the Easter bunny, follow the bunny, the bunny, the bunny, follow the Easter bunny,
23331100	23337100	search compost heap, I love it, a bit of cheeky vandalism.
23337100	23340100	Okay we did it, oh what did I do?
23340100	23350100	You find a small key, okay and now, okay.
23350100	23355100	Oh there's a thing ahead, okay there's a fountain ahead, I don't know, is that already from here?
23355100	23358100	I feel like someone's probably stuck in the house right now.
23358100	23361100	As long as you try and come outside then you'll be fine.
23361100	23365100	So as long as you've all got the key, come to the fountain next.
23365100	23371100	There's a fountain through the trees, the trees might whip you but you should survive, like it's literally one HP at least.
23371100	23376100	Poisoned fish food on the fountain, use on the fountain.
23376100	23382100	Oh the tree just made a noise, use it on the fountain.
23382100	23389100	Okay, the piranhas start eating the food then dine float to the surface.
23389100	23396100	And then search the fountain, there seems to be a pressure gauge in here and a lot of dead fish.
23396100	23401100	Well yeah you just roll them, smoke them.
23401100	23405100	Come outside, yes I see, I see.
23405100	23410100	Okay once we've all stopped head banging into the fountain.
23410100	23414100	And then we go back into the house.
23414100	23418100	Anyone got some spare poison fish?
23418100	23422100	Ah the poison was in the house I think.
23422100	23427100	Wait we're outside the house, how do we get back in? Why is it making me go around in a circle?
23427100	23436100	I'm spinning around, get out of my way.
23436100	23441100	I didn't think for how much time you prepared for this by the way, how is it, is it like you expected?
23441100	23444100	To me you're having a lot of fun but maybe you have more to say.
23444100	23449100	On RuneScape? I'm getting whipped by a tree, sorry, sorry Ruflin's getting whipped by a tree because of me, sorry.
23449100	23455100	I mean RuneScape it took a little second to like get ready to stream out, that wasn't that bad.
23455100	23459100	Scale it in time, you just have to run in and pick the chip then run out.
23459100	23463100	Okay should we take it in turns, who wants to go first?
23464100	23468100	Ah fuck it I'll go first, I'll need a lead by example.
23468100	23476100	Okay grab the chip and then, okay I got whacked for two so just make sure you get out in time.
23476100	23479100	Would you prefer to be whipped by a tree?
23479100	23483100	Is it instance or are we going to have to wait for that to reload?
23483100	23485100	Oh no you've got it, you've got it, okay it's fine.
23485100	23489100	Oh he beat him up, he said nah hold on let me do this Ruflin's I got this.
23489100	23494100	He's going to skillspec him, he's going to skillspec, he's going to do the little twirl thing.
23494100	23499100	Oh streaming in general has been absolutely fantastic, it's gone exactly the way I wanted it to.
23499100	23507100	Like I love streams Nathan and I love long streams and yapping people's heads off and it's just gone absolutely amazing.
23510100	23517100	Just fantastic, for me I don't like the mega super professional streams don't mind me.
23517100	23522100	Some people really like it, let's go, has everyone got it?
23522100	23528100	Thank you Ruflin for killing the skelly boy, has everyone got the rubber tube?
23528100	23536100	I don't think everyone's got it, I don't know if it's been a bit funny but you should be able to go in and get the rubber tube now that you've got the key.
23538100	23544100	Oh someone's getting attacked over there, there's a Ruflin, did a Ruflin, oh I thought a Ruflin just perished there.
23544100	23546100	I'm happy to hear that, yeah.
23547100	23551100	There is nothing like, yeah professional streams, where's the fish food?
23559100	23563100	Upstairs is the fish food, Ruflin, someone says.
23565100	23569100	Okay I'll wait here until the other Ruflins are caught up because it's not fair to skip ahead.
23570100	23574100	I like when funny Scott women yapt to me for hours, simple as, nothing more.
23574100	23580100	Now people really enjoy professional streams from other people which is great but for me I'm just like...
23589100	23593100	Oh we're getting two heads bang, yo I'm starting to think this is getting, hold on.
23593100	23598100	Oh no I can't wait, let me zoom up a bit, let me take one more step for no particular reason at all.
23598100	23601100	Okay let me take one more step for no particular reason at all.
23602100	23604100	Because it's absolutely no reason at all.
23609100	23612100	We are literal children, this is terrible.
23613100	23618100	That awful getting, hey hey hey he dancing on it, he dancing on it, he doing the split on it.
23623100	23625100	I love your silly yapping.
23626100	23628100	Oh my god a ghost is going for it.
23633100	23635100	Is there a Rufling on the outskirts?
23635100	23639100	Aw I think I'm too far away to be able to see if someone's at the compost heap right now.
23640100	23643100	Oh no someone's getting beaten up, oh no it's not him though.
23644100	23648100	I have salmon if you want a Rufling that's literally protecting us all.
23649100	23653100	There's salmon juice, whoa what is that? Oh is that for me?
23654100	23658100	Wait should I do this in the middle? I don't know what he does.
23659100	23664100	Scottlefish are you there? Should I do it or no? I don't know if the old man's got a good quest or not.
23666100	23667100	Did I talk to him?
23670100	23672100	Do it, okay someone says do it.
23672100	23676100	Oh there you are, I hoped you would talk to me, I get so lonely, I have a present I must get going now.
23678100	23681100	Oh he just gave me an uncut emerald, I didn't even ask anything.
23683100	23686100	Oh don't mind if I do, I thought he was going to like whiff to me are we?
23691100	23695100	Oh I see the poison, whoa poison's like 700.
23696100	23700100	Well I know where the poison is if anyone needs to know it's by the left.
23701100	23702100	There's your comment.
23704100	23706100	Does he need help?
23714100	23716100	You wish to trade with me, what do you wish to trade?
23717100	23723100	Oh you're giving it, oh the diamonds, how you call them?
23725100	23730100	I don't know the rocks in the ground, where are these called? It's not jewelry but they're rocks.
23732100	23736100	Where are diamonds category? Where's the category of ruby and plaffa and that?
23737100	23739100	Gemstones, oh my god I forgot that word there.
23739100	23745100	Jeez Louise, I literally forgot the word gems there, I apologise.
23746100	23751100	Watch ads showed up tipped and left, or in gemstones, I got out.
23752100	23753100	Oh god we're all headbanging.
23754100	23758100	Are you practicing later for when the next 10 audios come out?
23758100	23760100	Wait where is that headbanging?
23760100	23761100	Headbanging.
23765100	23769100	Oh my god we really are a cult clearly, look at us go.
23773100	23777100	Oh do you need health? Holy crap you need health like right now.
23778100	23780100	I've got salmon, this should heal you up.
23782100	23783100	Go go go.
23784100	23787100	Is there any wreathlings, oh no they're self healing.
23788100	23791100	Is there any wreathlings on the outskirts? I can't really tell.
23792100	23797100	I don't want to go ahead in case there's someone outside doing that fountain bit.
23799100	23801100	Is everyone here? Did we make it?
23802100	23806100	If there's a wreathling, who did that? Who did that?
23807100	23808100	That was you?
23808100	23811100	Okay we're reporting you for harassment.
23813100	23816100	Interesting we're in sync for me but on stream.
23817100	23819100	My ping is really high to everyone.
23820100	23823100	They've had plenty of time, yeah is everyone here I think so.
23824100	23828100	Hi hi how's stream going? It's been going amazing, look at me and the wreathling gang we're doing questing.
23829100	23835100	Okay I think everyone's got the plastic tube, they get the gauge and tube, get the oil can next.
23835100	23839100	So open this door and we'll go through.
23840100	23843100	Okay I think we're all ready.
23845100	23849100	Don't have the tube but also got the gauge but you don't have the tube.
23850100	23851100	I do have the tube.
23853100	23859100	Okay we need to interact with this blue thing over here but you've not got the tube? Who's not got the tube?
23859100	23860100	Who's not got the tube?
23865100	23867100	Tube you just run in and pick up when it spawns.
23869100	23872100	Go in the closet and get the rubber if you don't have- oh!
23873100	23874100	I shouldn't have said that.
23877100	23882100	Oh my god the ShadowbanTV's Twitter, all of our Twitter's looks like a Shadowban, it's ridiculous.
23883100	23884100	Like how sensitive it is.
23889100	23890100	Ah.
23892100	23894100	Oh what's that? It's a big thing.
23895100	23896100	Oh it's gone.
23897100	23900100	Did you get the tube? Did you get the tube? I think so.
23901100	23902100	Alright fun part of the quest let's go!
23903100	23905100	Let's go- oh the door- the door's fine.
23906100	23908100	Oh wait hold on sorry I probably just closed that door on you.
23909100	23910100	Okay search the bookcase.
23912100	23913100	Search the bookcase.
23914100	23916100	Oh is that one by one? Maybe a one by one moment, hold on.
23917100	23918100	Hey let's go.
23919100	23920100	Okay go down the ladder.
23921100	23922100	Oh wait go down the ladder when you're ready is that everyone?
23923100	23924100	Yeah that's everyone.
23925100	23926100	Once you get through the bookshelf.
23927100	23930100	Okay we did it the whole gang's here.
23931100	23932100	No refling left behind.
23935100	23937100	Oh my god we're beating up the rats literally.
23938100	23939100	Oh god what do we do?
23940100	23941100	Okay there's a lever on the wall.
23942100	23944100	Pull lever alpha on the wall over here.
23946100	23948100	I assume this is going to be instanced to us?
23949100	23950100	So I don't know.
23951100	23953100	And then pull lever Bravo!
23956100	23957100	Oh the music's all like-
23960100	23961100	Okay.
23962100	23964100	Now this gate is a jar.
23967100	23971100	And English if it's like slightly open it's a jar.
23972100	23973100	Pull lever D.
23973100	23976100	Oh I'll pull the D lever all day long.
23977100	23978100	Come over here weak one.
23981100	23982100	What did that do?
23983100	23984100	Okay.
23986100	23988100	Oh god it's a one by one gate.
23989100	23992100	Why is there a biggest issue right now a one by one gate?
23996100	23999100	Oil can has a slow respawn as well.
24000100	24002100	I think we all need an oil can.
24003100	24005100	So we're just gonna have to go for it and be patient.
24006100	24007100	I'm sure you can wait.
24008100	24010100	I don't know if all the levers are the same for everyone.
24011100	24014100	It looks like you guys are going different ways so I think it might be different.
24019100	24022100	World hop when you get into the room and then hop back.
24024100	24029100	Yeah you guys are really going different ways for me so I think it's different for everyone.
24030100	24033100	Oh the classic one by one gate it's ogre.
24034100	24036100	Lever solution is the same for everyone.
24036100	24037100	How is everyone going to wait?
24037100	24039100	Are you guys juicing this one?
24041100	24043100	That way everyone can grab it faster.
24043100	24044100	Yes.
24046100	24047100	Okay.
24047100	24048100	Okay.
24053100	24054100	Okay.
24054100	24058100	Okay I love this moonlight plugin because if I had to do this by my brain
24058100	24059100	it would be over.
24069100	24071100	This is crazy.
24075100	24077100	All levers are unique in their own way.
24077100	24078100	Exactly.
24082100	24083100	Let's see.
24083100	24084100	Pull this lever.
24084100	24085100	We're almost done?
24085100	24088100	Okay I was going to say that's like a lot of freaking question.
24088100	24090100	Oh wait sorry this one.
24091100	24094100	I'm going to see if my tea is at an acceptable temperature if I'm going to scold myself on it.
24094100	24096100	That's why there's one or the other.
24104100	24105100	All these doors.
24107100	24108100	Alright.
24111100	24114100	Am I taking it and then you guys are world hopping?
24115100	24116100	Okay.
24118100	24120100	And then you're coming back to this world?
24123100	24124100	Yeah this track is...
24130100	24133100	Gen 2 based after old school runescape tracks?
24133100	24134100	Question mark.
24136100	24138100	Oh wait I should be facing you today.
24140100	24142100	Honestly I wouldn't mind that.
24142100	24143100	I'm kind of down for that.
24143100	24148100	I was actually thinking of Legend of Zelda Minish Cap
24148100	24153100	but brought you know to kind of modern standards for Gen 2
24153100	24154100	but honestly runescape?
24154100	24156100	Runescape always do.
24158100	24162100	If we had like a mischievous little brat thing this song
24162100	24164100	was kind of like...
24164100	24167100	not circus- I guess it's circus-esque.
24168100	24170100	Does everyone have an oil can?
24170100	24171100	Or...
24171100	24173100	Oh there's a respawn.
24173100	24175100	Well that took a whole second.
24175100	24177100	Everyone got an oil can?
24177100	24179100	Yeah no you're taking it now.
24180100	24184100	Okay if you have an oil can come back out to the center over here.
24184100	24188100	If you don't have an oil can wait for it to spawn in that room
24188100	24190100	or you can do what's called world hopping
24190100	24193100	where you purposely swap to a new world
24193100	24196100	and it should be like a new instant.
24196100	24199100	But if you have an oil can you're allowed to come out here.
24200100	24202100	Minish is 20 years old now.
24202100	24204100	Stubious brat.
24206100	24207100	Eh I would watch Zelda.
24207100	24208100	That's an idea.
24208100	24209100	I will uncontroll.
24209100	24212100	Oh unconditionally support whoever gets sea shanty.
24212100	24214100	No it has to be like hidden
24214100	24217100	but when you know what it is you know.
24217100	24219100	Oh there's a reefling there.
24219100	24221100	We're not ready yet.
24221100	24223100	I'll just check if anyone's back here.
24223100	24224100	Other than that reefling.
24224100	24225100	Oh there's one there.
24225100	24226100	And one there.
24227100	24228100	I was just straight up reefling.
24228100	24230100	You actually got the name reefling.
24230100	24231100	I'm surprised no one else took it.
24231100	24232100	I don't know that thing about it.
24232100	24234100	I guess we'll just beat up.
24234100	24235100	We're gonna beat up rats out here.
24235100	24238100	Okay we're just gonna get our combat level a bit higher.
24238100	24240100	Oh I just leveled up.
24240100	24241100	What did I get?
24241100	24242100	I got a Taksix.
24242100	24244100	Oh there's spiders as well.
24244100	24246100	Yeah let's just level up our combat a little bit.
24246100	24247100	Why not?
24249100	24251100	Us following her gives me
24251100	24254100	Ugandan knuckles flashbacks.
24254100	24256100	This beat only fake queen.
24258100	24260100	Would you hum shanti?
24280100	24282100	Yeah I managed to get the reefling name
24282100	24284100	still five hours in ancient...
24286100	24288100	That's sea shanti.
24289100	24291100	We're just leveling up our combat.
24292100	24294100	There's still a reefling over there getting absolutely...
24294100	24296100	What are you getting annihilated by?
24296100	24297100	A rat?
24297100	24298100	Oh okay that's fine.
24299100	24300100	There's one there.
24300100	24301100	There's a third?
24301100	24302100	Yeah.
24302100	24304100	We've got Hatsumiku chilling over there.
24308100	24309100	Reefling there.
24310100	24312100	Now we have a max roll.
24315100	24316100	Get some level.
24316100	24318100	No way that rat just dunked my shield.
24318100	24319100	I went bonk.
24320100	24322100	Yeah and we would have chosen
24322100	24323100	Dewey.
24324100	24325100	Chocho is Dewey.
24325100	24326100	You have found Dewey.
24326100	24329100	I remember that meme went like absolutely viral.
24329100	24332100	Someone said that was the start of the brain rot meta
24332100	24334100	when it comes to memes.
24336100	24338100	Which I found rather unsafe.
24340100	24341100	Wow.
24343100	24345100	I think there's someone else that's fighting that.
24345100	24346100	Here we go.
24348100	24351100	We've almost got all of our cans.
24351100	24353100	And then we'll level up on fishing.
24353100	24354100	I keep saying fishing.
24354100	24355100	It's not fishing.
24355100	24356100	We're doing kooten.
24359100	24360100	My PC's fan just started up.
24360100	24362100	I get nervous when my PC's...
24362100	24363100	I'm like what's wrong?
24363100	24364100	What's wrong?
24367100	24368100	Oh!
24368100	24370100	Last reefling that needs to can?
24370100	24371100	The question mark?
24371100	24373100	I don't see anyone else doing the levers.
24373100	24374100	Am I going crazy?
24374100	24375100	Or are we clear?
24375100	24376100	Have we did it?
24376100	24378100	Are we ready to move on?
24378100	24381100	Are we stunting on as they're dancing?
24381100	24382100	Okay.
24382100	24384100	If everyone's got a can, up the ladders please.
24384100	24385100	Little reeflings.
24385100	24387100	If everyone's got a can.
24387100	24388100	Oh wait no!
24388100	24389100	Sorry!
24389100	24390100	Sorry!
24390100	24391100	There's one more.
24391100	24392100	Sorry.
24392100	24393100	There's one more reefling.
24393100	24394100	I'm sorry.
24394100	24395100	I debated you.
24395100	24396100	There's one more reefling.
24397100	24400100	I think they're still doing the lever stage.
24400100	24401100	I'm sorry reefling.
24401100	24402100	I debated you.
24402100	24405100	You can come back down and we'll keep killing the means.
24409100	24411100	He's getting absolutely beaten up by that rat.
24411100	24412100	See I'll help you out.
24412100	24413100	There you go.
24422100	24424100	Did you get it?
24424100	24425100	I don't know.
24427100	24428100	Did you get it?
24428100	24430100	You're moving around erratically.
24430100	24432100	Is the reefling...
24435100	24436100	I don't know.
24436100	24438100	Are you stuck on the levers?
24438100	24439100	You're not taping.
24443100	24444100	Go on.
24444100	24445100	I'll catch up.
24445100	24446100	Are you sure reeflings?
24446100	24448100	I don't want to feel anyone feel left out.
24450100	24452100	VR chat was wailed.
24452100	24454100	No it's just a feel of weird.
24454100	24459100	I was going to have to play VR chat to learn how the 3D models work.
24459100	24462100	I have no idea how that 3D model streaming works.
24463100	24466100	I don't know if you can use other programs as well.
24467100	24470100	I'm leveling combat not to brag about it.
24476100	24477100	You will learn.
24477100	24479100	Can you say era again?
24479100	24480100	Era?
24481100	24482100	Era.
24482100	24483100	Era.
24485100	24487100	Errot switch and tracks.
24487100	24489100	You don't need to use VR chat for 3D models?
24490100	24493100	I honestly don't know anything about it.
24493100	24496100	Girls want 3D models and I'll pay for it.
24496100	24498100	That's pretty much all I know about 3D models.
24498100	24500100	I'm joking.
24500100	24502100	Just say you want 3D models and we'll get it.
24506100	24508100	VR hypnotize and interest and...
24509100	24510100	Oh!
24510100	24513100	I saw VR ASMR videos.
24513100	24515100	I thought that was pretty cool
24516940	24521980	And plus it would cool to see the height difference of the girls as well go on y'all find you
24524060	24528780	Okay, okay, we're being sent away by the reflying right upstairs everyone we're being sent away

24583500	24587740	Irritating being a chicken. How can I ever thank you? Well a cash reward is always nice
24588140	24590140	Of course, of course
24590220	24592940	You're awarded four quest points of 300 coins
24593820	24597020	Oh really quick other than like the horrific
24597820	24599820	Issues that was like a really quick quest
24601900	24605980	Um, right we're not doing any more quests then we're leveling up next
24606860	24608860	Money, let's go
24608940	24613740	What is this pressure gauge? Don't touch it. It's gonna explode. Where we do
24614860	24616860	What pressure gauge?
24618620	24624380	Mm-hmm. Is there like any other scientific things? Nah, I guess that's it and we just leave
24625980	24627980	But that
24628220	24630780	It's in the fountain. That's why you need to poison it. How bizarre
24632540	24634540	Oh, there's the fish food
24636220	24639500	I guess that's it. We're already we're already freaking doing this quest. Hold on.
24640220	24641980	Wow
24641980	24644460	Oh wait, why why did you not let me out that door?
24645020	24650220	Open large door. Wait, why does it make me turn backwards?
24653020	24656700	I keep it doesn't let me have this door open large door
24657820	24660140	It won't open front door is one way
24661340	24665180	Whoa. Oh, so we have to like go all the way around again. Oh, okay
24667260	24671740	Brother interesting take from the deputy. All right, let me let me sip into my teeth
24675420	24681740	Okay, yeah, I'll go another one by one door. It's over. I like the chairs like chase you
24683740	24688460	Do you can you even go that way? Oh you can you can come around the this side?
24690460	24693660	Can you teach me what to play rinse game tempo?
24696300	24698300	Get right go ahead back
24698780	24700780	Oh
24701820	24703820	The tree
24703980	24707260	I don't want to go into fight move. What's going on? Why can't I move?
24708780	24710780	Hello
24712220	24718220	Am I missing why can I not why that tree literally had me in a death grip. Oh my gosh
24721740	24723740	Mostly was a guy a fan
24724540	24727580	Don't get skill checked by a tree literally one arrow
24728540	24731900	There. I think the tree liked you honestly
24733900	24739900	Okay, we made it but I don't think that's all the reeflings man going outside is dangerous. Literally. Oh, there's a reason there
24742060	24747820	Right, we'll wait until a cool army. I have an army of reeflings requesting but we're about to go level up or cooking next
24748940	24751420	I'm trying to try to finish my honey tea before it gets cold
24751900	24753900	Oh
24755500	24757500	Okay, um
24757500	24762380	Next thing we're going to do is we're going to travel north. We're going to take a
24763100	24765660	A west and then north and we're going to be outside
24766300	24767900	Uh the village
24767900	24771900	But we need to go get fishing rods and stuff. I don't think there's a fish shop nearby
24772300	24775260	So I think we're going to go to the grand exchange and buy fishing rods
24776060	24780860	Army definitely not cool. This music is giving me a
24782620	24784620	Fatal dose of nostalgia
24785740	24788300	Pass so much since the last get rector is
24791340	24794940	As I get stuck and fling fast and fly I never got anywhere
24795500	24800940	RuneScape is like either you got into or you didn't right. I think that's everyone. Hopefully question mark
24801740	24804300	as we head banger way of victory
24805340	24809980	I don't know about the other reefling that got stuck and sent us forward, but thank you for not holding us back
24811340	24815420	But at the same time I feel bad because it's like the whole point of this is to the question and stuff together
24815500	24821340	Right, let's get in the nicer parts of the channel the the evil at bay type of thing go away
24822620	24824620	Wait, let me finish my tea
24827660	24833020	Either you got into it and you're still playing this day or you didn't see I got into guild wars instead. I don't play killed
24835500	24837500	Oh
24843740	24848940	I thought it gave us feathers, but it didn't I was just an image of a feather because we need feathers to do fishing
24853580	24856460	I was so into it and was so shy that in typing class
24856460	24860460	I won't be glad as RuneScape rules and wait for someone to see it and ask me if I played
24860860	24862860	Oh, that's such a shame
24866140	24868540	Feathers we need feathers
24869660	24871500	Birds of a feather
24871500	24875100	Right, we're gonna take a left and go
24876460	24878860	Oh wait, no, do we need to go to ports RM?
24880300	24884140	I think we actually need to go at the fishing shop to buy our rod and feathers
24885020	24887020	the fishing shops
24887500	24890220	West and south so we'll go west and south

25782480	25787520	Oh, there here here there the one in the the one in the smithing cape
25789280	25793440	If you don't have a fly fishing rod trade, then I'm gonna put my stuff in the bank
25794720	25796720	But

25811680	25813680	Oh, no, I'll have a better shield. That's why
25814400	25818080	And then put that away and then put the fishing rod away and then put the money away
25819040	25821040	I don't know. I didn't mean to click that. Okay
25822320	25824800	Okay, we did it. We're ready to fish and cook
25826000	25828000	Apparently everyone has a rod jeez
25829440	25831440	It must do a rod
25832560	25834560	A fishing rod
25834640	25839440	It's my idea the strange old woman in the forest isn't full with so many strange requests
25841280	25845120	Uh, I guess we're ready to take off if everyone's emptied their inventory
25845200	25849760	And you should have a rod and feathers and then we are going to go fishing and level up our cooking eggs
25849840	25851840	exponentially. Is everyone ready?
25852080	25855200	All aboard the golden apron train
25857040	25861760	I'll just make sure in case someone's stuck at the bank right now. It's kind of hard to tell because there's like so many
25861760	25863760	Oh, no, there's only
25863920	25865920	Rods out the way to everyone
25866000	25868000	so few female
25869120	25871520	And it is what it is
25873760	25876960	Oh wishes to trade with you. Okay. What's up?

25898480	25900480	Right, is that everyone?
25902000	25904000	Uh
25904240	25910160	Can I store it somewhere or just drop stuff off? Oh, yeah. So do you see over here how it says
25910720	25912720	uh bank banker
25914160	25917120	And then click on your inventory and it'll put it in the bank
25917440	25921840	This empties out your inventory. The only thing you want right now is a fly fishing rod and feathers
25922640	25924640	banana
25925920	25927920	It's tweet all over again
25928240	25933680	I actually had a lot of fun. Thank you. That's me. I don't know what it's I don't know if it's gotten more popular or not
25934400	25937760	But when I woke up it was like 1000 likes and I'm like, oh
25944320	25946320	Okay, that should hopefully be
25947680	25953920	Uh, and then we'll take all the reeflings away. Actually we'll follow. Well, I don't know if all the reeflings are over here
25955600	25957600	Think you got it
25958640	25964320	She just ate that man's banana live on public on stream in public in front of everyone
25966880	25973120	Okay, is that all reeflings? I'm like nine names. Oh, no one more one more. There's one more reefing
25974080	25977200	Look at that fit look at the feet size
25979040	25981040	Okay, we now follow
25982000	25986160	The reeflings I thought was making a threat via the poison and fish fish
25988800	25990800	That video was good
25992080	25996800	Okay reeflings, we're going to barbarian village. Uh, hopefully there's no bots talking
25996880	25998880	I'm probably just gonna click ignore
25999440	26004000	If there's any bot so we don't have to world hop because this is a pretty quiet world in general
26005040	26007040	Yeah, it was great. I lost that video
26008240	26010240	Really
26010880	26013360	I was like wondering should I like over compliment
26013920	26017920	Over complicate it and like say like certain words phrase or whatever and I was like, no
26018160	26020640	Just be super simple about it. So I was
26020640	26022640	I
26022880	26024880	Did it
26025600	26030320	Right, okay. So this is barbarian fishing section
26031360	26035920	It's normally bought it, but I don't know this may be real people
26035920	26041520	This is the best like free to play area. We'll do here. We'll lure our fishing world
26043440	26046720	And uh, how are you a cow? You were a bunny a second ago
26047520	26049520	Oh
26049920	26053760	I've already caught a fish. Whoa the fishing is so fast
26056240	26058800	Oh my god, really gonna be leveling up so quickly
26065520	26069520	Well, once whatever you catch there's a pair of my fire over here that we could cook
26071360	26075840	Everyone did get level 20 fishing, right or I've just dragged you over here for nothing
26077680	26080160	I hope everyone's uh
26082640	26084640	Oh, you're all up to 20
26088640	26090640	Uh
26091840	26094800	Oh, no, I thought everyone was 20 fishing. I'm so sorry
26097280	26099280	Oh, I'm not level 20. No
26100240	26102240	No
26102640	26104640	My suggestion
26104640	26111760	If you're not level 20, you need to get that net and go back to the thing. I joined late. I'll level in tunes night later
26113760	26115760	Not me, but I'll jump over and get it quick
26117520	26120640	Oh, no, there's a banana on the floor random banana
26121360	26123360	Oh
26126320	26128320	So any that video in your altar is one of the whole
26132560	26134800	How many leaks is that I'm allowed to know
26136400	26141280	If you aren't level 20, I would suggest going
26142080	26147360	Back to Lumbridge teleport to Lumbridge get your small fishing net out the bank at the top
26147680	26150160	And then go back to that spot until you're 20
26150880	26152880	And then coming here
26153360	26157280	Well, I'm already level 21. Jesus so much faster doing this. It's crazy
26159040	26161040	Is that 1.4?
26162400	26164960	As long as people enjoyed it, that's the main thing
26168880	26175040	What level to bait fish here, I'm not sure I only brought feathers for fly fish
26178080	26180080	No comment
26181440	26183440	Okay
26185040	26188800	Should I do a burp at the end of one of them? Maybe I should they do like a burp version
26195280	26196800	But yes
26196800	26200240	If I we're probably gonna be here for like a hot second
26201040	26206160	Uh mercy's going up in an hour 40. So honestly, I think for the rest of the stream
26206160	26210400	We're gonna be here. So if you want to level up to 20 cooking you certainly can
26211360	26216560	It's sorry 20 fishing and then like come back here. Like we'll probably most likely be here
26219680	26221440	And
26221440	26227760	Hopefully I can stop burning fish and then I can start burning through the supplies that were gifted because like I think I got like
26228160	26231840	2000 fish gifted to me. I'll be back. Good luck. Yeah
26232480	26236240	Have a good time. You can teleport via your magic spell
26237120	26238800	Get on to
26238880	26240320	Get to
26240320	26244160	Lumberge again and do that small thing and then come back here once you've got your fly fishing rod
26244400	26246400	And I've got loads of feathers on me
26252560	26258960	Yeah, this is where the ground begins. We are currently at 25 cooking which is decent
26259440	26264080	I wanted to get 40 before stream. I think 40 is part of that camera animation
26264480	26267440	I think 40 is 40 realistic before
26268400	26270400	The mercy goes live. I'm not sure
26271360	26276080	I'm not sure bait fishing is 25. Oh, that's even worse. How do you get
26276880	26278880	grapes actually
26279440	26283120	From the grand exchange. I don't actually know where you harvest them
26287600	26289600	Tea time
26290240	26295920	We're actually going to get decent level in fishing. Yeah. Whoa, it's 58 peter fish. That's quite a lot
26296960	26298960	All things considered
26299040	26303200	I'm gonna level up in fishing again on this one stalk of enemy door
26305920	26307920	Yeah
26312080	26316400	Oh, that's a lot of trout on the floor. That's literally 10 key worth of fish
26317360	26319040	13
26319040	26321040	kxp per hour
26321760	26324560	If you don't cook the fish, yeah, we're gonna have to stop and use this fire
26324560	26327600	But this is a permanent fire that we can utilize for ourselves
26328720	26330720	Which is fantastic
26332160	26338880	Would it make sense to just buy them in bulk? Yeah, especially if you do that route and just buy 66. Oh, that would be daunting
26340560	26342560	But it's definitely a possibility
26346400	26348400	Hmm
26349280	26353680	I'm wondering maybe we could do react andy content
26356160	26360560	I don't know if there's like stuff that's safe for youtube reaction whilst we do this
26361200	26362320	because
26362320	26368000	Don't get me wrong. I'm entertaining, but I don't think I'm that entertaining for like a 30 hour grind
26368880	26370880	If I was doing grapes
26373040	26375040	Oh
26376000	26378000	So maybe
26379280	26381280	We put stuff on in the background
26383600	26387760	78 p for cooking trout. Whoa
26390800	26394960	That's so fast we're literally 26 already
26396800	26398800	That is so fast
26399360	26403840	We need mancraft parkour subway surfers and the bomb in the stream on play
26405760	26411760	70 is so much when we unlock salmon. I don't even know how much fun it is
26414640	26416640	I'll stop burning it stop burning it
26430160	26432660	Just put some surf in the corner
26435840	26437440	Okay
26437440	26441600	Yeah, so this is like free grinding as well if you pick up this fish that people drop
26443600	26448880	Oh, they literally went on two cooking levels doing one batch of fish. That's crazy
26451600	26453600	I'm so fast
26453760	26455760	Right, let's leave people alone
26456720	26458720	Here fishy fishy
26458800	26463520	We need to be quiet. We're just gonna get to the molly salmon or 90 cooking eggs. Okay. That will
26464480	26470160	I'll listen to you. Yeah, whenever, but I've lost my mind entirely see tomorrow rest well, please rest well
26471680	26477440	Gotta get up tomorrow. We can oh fun time. Oh my god. It's rinse scape in real life
26480080	26485440	I'm trying to get easily watched. There's been nothing by yapping. It's because of my voice. It's so swan
26486640	26490960	My faceman no dragon harpoon specking on free world. Oh
26493520	26495520	Oh
26499520	26501520	Wow
26502080	26504080	I haven't seen it
26505040	26511280	Honestly, we I thought we were gonna do 40 before mercy comes on but if we managed to like fish
26512320	26514160	to high heaven
26514160	26517360	We might be past 40. I don't know. I don't want to jinx it but
26518320	26521840	40 on the first runescape stream seems pretty decent work
26522000	26524000	And we also did fun questing
26527440	26530240	We got how many first one two
26531760	26533760	We're so fast one two
26534560	26536560	three four five
26537360	26540000	Six and seven well, maybe do
26543280	26545280	23
26545680	26549200	Got overtime tomorrow, so I'm gonna have to so have plenty of listening time
26549200	26551200	I mean
26551600	26555600	For anyone that needs to go to sleep or you need to go do some things
26555680	26560960	Please do not worry. You're not missing out on much. This is literally the gameplay for the next uh hour and a half
26561040	26563040	I'm not even kidding
26563120	26565120	We're just fishing and then uh
26565360	26570320	We're catching the fish and then cooking them and then leveling up cooking. This is literally squirting me right now
26570480	26571840	Brian
26571840	26574960	Hey, how strong are you back from work and jumping back on
26575280	26576320	Where are you at?
26576320	26578000	Hi tiny spinny
26578000	26582640	Hope you had fun at work. We are currently in world 3a
26583520	26589360	And we are in barbarian village. We're fishing so the grand exchange
26590000	26593280	Varrock teleport and we're at the fishing village
26593680	26600720	We have a fly fishing rod and we have a feather and we're catching the fish and cooking them on the perma
26601200	26602800	a
26602800	26604000	cookie thing
26604080	26607200	Um once I'm experienced enough not to burn fish
26607360	26612800	I most likely will cook all the fish that the reeflings gave me because I don't want them to go to waste
26613520	26617520	Um because that was a lot of money that the reeflings handed me. Um
26618960	26620480	I don't
26620480	26623600	I'll cook all of that and see where we are. I think lobsters
26624480	26626480	I got quite a few lobsters
26626880	26629440	trout, salmon, all of that. So we're gonna cook all of that
26629920	26635440	I don't think we're gonna be on wanes by the time mercy comes on
26636800	26638800	Um
26639040	26641040	I think tomorrow's my eighth morris stream
26642400	26645920	So I definitely try and rest my voice so that's gonna be so strong
26647520	26651040	I'm ready for another 2am yap session. We're listening to the Scottish last
26652560	26656560	I've got plenty of yapping. We're like oh someone's got a mini
26657520	26659520	mini quest a two jump
26660160	26662160	Hot to free power hot to free power
26669600	26673280	Such a tense gameplay. Oh my god. It's so intense. Wait. I'm not even fishing anyone
26674000	26678160	That's probably the only thing that kills me about this game like when it comes to fishing and stuff
26679040	26681040	It's when the boxes move
26682560	26685360	But it is very tense into um
26686800	26690640	Like pick up all the fish that are already here and just do that and spawn that
26691360	26694880	Lobster requires 40 cooking so might be a way. I don't want to burn them
26696160	26698160	Here we are going to 4am. I'm ready
26700320	26709280	Yes, so if you want to join in some say hi world 380 um barbarian village fishing spot free to play free to play
26710000	26712000	a little cheeky free to play um
26712960	26715200	If I get the runescape
26716160	26719200	Um, if I do end up getting the cooking cape
26719760	26720960	We might take a break
26720960	26725440	But I wouldn't mind doing membership quest at some point because I've never actually done them
26725440	26728800	And I'm too scared to do them on my own, but if you guys are with me, I'm not scared
26731360	26736320	Yes, I think tomorrow's ASMR stream and then day after is trying sweet
26737760	26743200	And then after is Skyrim and I get to rant. No not rant. Sorry. I get to um
26743920	26745920	Mumble away about Skyrim for ages
26747120	26751760	Lobsters have a 60% chance to burn at level 40. Yeah, I'm not wasting lobsters. They are
26753360	26755360	That is rough
26755360	26756960	That's rough
26756960	26760320	I don't want to waste a lot. Wait, because that was so much fish I got given
26760880	26763520	God, we're like leveling up our fishing so easily
26766480	26770800	Right, we are full. Let's see. Can we get two levels out of this if we don't burn them?
26771360	26773360	It burns for the first one
26775760	26779280	Dude, waterfall fires, it gets you to combat level 30. What?
26780560	26781920	Really?
26781920	26784960	I know I got some quests really give you a lot of XP, but
26786160	26790320	Can't wait for days more, but I'm lucky for the time. Maybe I'll pass a bit later. Hmm
26791760	26793760	Um
26793840	26797600	Don't worry if you can't make it to any stream like I think the boss will stay up and
26798560	26802800	I'm not going to be doing ear licking because something weird is going on with YouTube
26803760	26808800	It's going on a little weird with YouTube and I don't know what's going on. So I'm not risking it
26812720	26815280	As I gave you all those lobsters you can burn them if you need to
26817680	26824240	I'd rather not like waste the XP like if it was potential full XP like it's okay to burn these trout for example
26824240	26826240	Oh
26826480	26832000	Oh, come on one more and I'll level up. Okay. There we go 20. Oh, yeah
26833760	26837440	I want 40 before mercy comes online. We're under the clock refunds
26838560	26840560	But under the clock
26840640	26844880	Empty inventory. Let's get it ish get it. I don't know if I should fish or if I should honestly
26846160	26847680	Just put my stuff away and pick up
26847680	26852480	But if everyone was picking up what was put on the floor then we wouldn't have enough trout to go around
26855200	26857200	Mmm
26858880	26862560	Where would be the first day smart? Hopefully YouTube will get off
26864720	26871200	No, it's like cracking down everywhere on anime smart in particular if you want to call it anime smart
26874160	26878880	It'll be faster to loot the fish if you just want to do a cooking. That's what I'm thinking
26881040	26883040	If I just do that instead
26883760	26885760	Mmm
26887120	26892320	It's nice to get the level of XP, but I feel I'm gonna like blast ahead of you refunds if I do that
26892320	26894320	Would you guys be upset if I picked up trout?
26896080	26898080	Hopefully not
26898320	26901920	It would blast me forward though like compared to everyone's level
26907600	26909600	Go for it
26910560	26911760	Ah
26911760	26917360	What do I need I just need trout. I can't cook salmon because I'm too low level wait examine
26919280	26923360	No, I don't want salmon. I can't cook it. I want trout
26924960	26929840	Right, we'll see how far this gets me ahead if I do this method where I don't fish
26930320	26934080	Maybe you guys can drop the fish for me and we get fish train going
26934800	26936800	It's two more
26936960	26938960	Right, let's cook this batch
26940320	26942160	I like fish
26942160	26944160	The fish are so amazing
26946720	26950400	Basically, if you can't see what they're actually doing there are a few minutes. Yes
26950720	26955840	I think that's what the problem is why in real life is fine, but anime's getting swapped with it
26957520	26960480	I say anime beach over animation. You know what me
26961920	26963920	Anyway, I start blasting
26965360	26967360	We're fish slaves let's go
26968160	26970160	Sounds a bit fishy, but okay
26977280	26979280	Are we gonna make it I think we are
26981200	26983200	I said
26984400	26986400	No idea when I said oh
26988640	26991360	29 already. Oh my god, this is so fast
26991760	26996800	I'm I'm saying it's fast now because it's going to be so slow later, but like I'm happy
26997600	27000240	I like only burnt four from that batch as well
27001280	27004080	That trout is getting cooked to perfection by me
27006240	27008240	I see trout I see trout
27012400	27014400	I don't know. There's a cooked trout
27014640	27018720	Right, I'm gonna have to fish you go fish. Oh wait, someone wants to trade with me. Hold on
27022240	27025760	Oh, you'll never guess what it's true
27027440	27029440	He he he
27029520	27036320	Oh, no, you cancelled. Oh, you don't have enough incidentary space. Oh, no, sorry. I don't know how many I've got left like
27037760	27040240	Space room freaking yeah
27043360	27049440	Trade modified blink blink blink. It's so serious. I don't know if that's too much. Oh, no
27049840	27055200	Is it? Oh, you filled me. Oh my inventory you filled my inventory. Thank you beef life
27061280	27064080	I'm terrible, but thank you very much. We've flown
27065200	27071200	It's running out here playing cooking mummy. Literally. I'm feeding you don't get 100 success on trout until 49
27071920	27074640	That's so rough. I don't remember it being so like that
27079440	27081440	Mmm
27086720	27088720	We're already gonna level up again
27090800	27093840	I don't know when we unlock being able to cook salmon, but it's gonna be soon
27093920	27096800	We're gonna drop all the trout in the south spot of salmon here. Yeah
27098320	27101280	If you don't overlap on the salmon, it makes it so easy to pick up
27102240	27104240	Wow
27104560	27106960	Are we gonna be 50 by the time mercy?
27106960	27108960	I
27109200	27111200	We may honestly
27114320	27117040	I'm I'm cooking by gas. I'm cooking the best I can
27118240	27121840	Okay, we had like way more burnt in that batch. So it really is just randomized
27122720	27126720	Let's empty our inventory and then let's grab all these troops
27126720	27128720	Oh
27134480	27136960	Over there Hayden. Oh wait, sorry
27138880	27144720	Uh, I don't know if you have to take into I can't how much like inventory space I'll have
27147920	27152180	Okay, yeah as long as you put whatever inventory
27157600	27160640	Oh my god
27162320	27164320	Love's recessing
27165840	27171040	The key to power leveling is slave teamwork. Honestly, we're doing pretty good
27172640	27175200	We're already launching the 30s
27177840	27179840	I think we can fly past the 40s
27180000	27181520	honestly
27181520	27183840	I strongly have been away from what's the how's it going?
27184880	27189680	We have done some quests some free to play quests. We are currently at
27190560	27192400	barbarian village
27192400	27195120	And I'm currently using the reef wings
27195840	27202880	Um to slave fish for me. So we're getting trout and I'm currently like leveling up like crazy right now
27204560	27208880	Every batch of trout is making me go up another level. I'm already 31 cooking
27209840	27214240	We, um, we're messing around having fun on quest
27215120	27219120	Uh, and now I'm just doing I'm actually tempted to go to the grand exchange to
27219360	27221360	Oh, sorry, I'm pressing the wrong button. Um
27222080	27229600	I'm tempted to go to the grand exchange to drop the feathers and the fishing rod off just to do like full inventories as well
27230320	27236080	I think I may I'm going to be right back reef wings. Okay. I'm going to drop the feathers and the fishing rod away

27326960	27332320	Who it's who dares the spots picking up? It's faster to drop the trout than it is to trade me
27332880	27334880	Right. Okay. Full inventory
27337360	27341200	We're going to be in the 50s after this. There's no way we're not

27368800	27370800	Can't believe it
27371440	27373440	Check your xp per hour on the bar
27375280	27377280	Uh

27392240	27396880	It's not like telling me literally level 20. It's not like telling me. Why is it weird?
27399920	27401920	Hmm

27408240	27414720	Uh, oh this one. Oh now we're talking hold on let me drop all these
27417040	27423200	It says for not fishing cooking. Where is cooking? Where's cooking?
27425360	27428320	Here cooking is purple. Why would it be purple honestly?
27429920	27432800	All right, let me grab the all these trout. There's like so much on the floor honestly
27432800	27434800	I
27435440	27437440	Can't keep up there's so much
27440160	27445440	It says I'm gaining 2000 xp per hour
27447360	27452160	Oh, there's trout trout trout trout no the trout not the fire
27453520	27455520	Now I've got a fill inventory
27456800	27458800	Wow, all right, let's see
27459520	27465200	xp gained 16 hour roughly 2k but it's probably going to go up for a bit because I'm not being doing fill trout and
27466080	27468080	xp left
27468080	27470960	Oh, no, it's getting covered up by the freaking layer
27475840	27481520	I'm coming back in we're at barbarian village at the free play fishing spot
27483760	27486800	But I think we're definitely higher. Yeah, this is going up
27486800	27490560	It says we're now 2.3 per hour because we've not done it for an hour but
27492080	27495520	Once we have it says actually I don't even see that
27496960	27502080	Of course not it says like it literally says like six actions left and then we've leveled up so
27502720	27508960	That's really good. I like that and kind of puts into perspective like how much you need to do in order to get next
27509760	27519840	You can write literally level 33 you can reset
27524800	27527440	That's the only burnt to all burnt three that time
27532000	27536240	They don't look burn three that time. I'm so MLG pro
27539600	27542000	Well, I shouldn't maybe drop the
27547280	27550160	I don't know when I can start cooking salmon, but it should be sent to him
27555680	27559040	She needs that raw fish meat. Are you treating me fish?
27561120	27562240	Oh
27562240	27566320	Oh, no, I don't have inventory for that. Is that tuna? I'm pretty sure that's tuna
27566720	27573200	Sorry, I don't have any. Oh, you're giving me three tuna. I don't even think I'm like leveling enough to do that
27574000	27576640	What are you use tuna on the fire?

27729680	27731680	I have been here for like four hours
27733840	27738960	Oh, I keep messing it up. I wonder if you could sell kuchina for decent money. I don't think it's a cheap fish
27740480	27743360	I seem to think like all right raw trout time
27746240	27749440	Uh fishing levels, uh, um
27753680	27758080	What the fuck runes get message saying I'm going to be logged in 30 minutes max six hours play. Wait, is that real?
27759360	27762080	Wait, you got more tuna already. Wait, you can't have
27763280	27765280	I
27765600	27767600	How are you doing?
27767840	27772880	Are you peddling tuna to me to level me up faster? I feel like I'm wasting all your tuna
27775520	27777520	Oh, no
27777760	27782720	Wait, are we finally doing it? Are we are we got tuna slave runners?
27785360	27787360	Yes, like there was log is real
27787440	27791440	Wait, am I gonna be booted out or because I bought membership? I'm not gonna be booted out
27792240	27794720	I have plenty of tuna. I could literally buy a million
27797840	27805200	Hey, scrawny, am I in trouble for cooking my own food tonight? Does that mean I could just jump into the kitchen? You're allowed to make it
27807520	27813520	He that is messed up. I'm not a child literally why is the game doing it for a bandwidth issues
27814160	27816800	If you're a free member, they're like, oh, we've had enough of you
27817760	27824320	Strawny becomes a master chef, but can't fight a rat. No, it was the cow that was going to kill me. It was a baby cow
27826800	27828800	And you just log in right back after
27830240	27832880	That's bizarre. No, I mean, what?
27834320	27840880	Well, it says we've been up for seven hours or is it because I got logged out when I went away for like a cup of tea in that
27841440	27843440	I wonder if that's why
27844320	27845840	Hold on
27845840	27848480	Is tuna max is tuna max were there?
27850720	27855280	I've got booted out at one point. Yeah, you've just been dc in a lot. Okay. Every time I go for tinkle winkle
27855600	27857600	I've been dc'd so it doesn't count
27858480	27864800	How much do you care about doing the proper way? Um, I think I'm supposed to do wine next someone says hi, emmy
27865360	27867360	Is the emmy imposter here

27873840	27875440	Oh, there it is
27875440	27881760	You changed your name to emmy visa and game level 113. That's a big account. Honestly
27883200	27885200	Okay, let me grab this
27887680	27890640	Emmys emmy's a RuneScape nerd
27892640	27898560	No, it's not the real embers, but someone likes her so I'm glad someone enjoys her as much to do that
27899520	27906640	Emmy the goat honestly, what's the fit on emmy? Oh, they changed her hair to look like her pumpkins and everything
27907360	27910400	Give her a skirt. That's supposed to be her blue shorts
27911280	27913280	Okay, okay
27915680	27917680	Where is that
27917920	27925520	We're already level 35. Oh, we should have came here like from the beginning. We didn't even have had to do anything
27926480	27930240	Yeah, and that baby cow has been caught for a cake
27933120	27935920	Hydration check I'm actually running out of water

27947440	27949200	Wow
27949200	27954240	It gives me like relief drinking water for a millisecond and then I feel the pain of talking again
27955760	27957760	Let's breathe this raw trip
27958880	27960720	Raw trip

27970880	27974800	That tuna man going ham oh my god, that's so much money
27975760	27981440	Absolutely nothing and then the value on your side is just like losing horrifically
27982160	27984160	You

27991920	27997920	Excuse me, man. We had to level up to 20 fish and to start fishing here. Yes. You have to go back to
27998880	28002160	Uh, the castello. Good luck. Thank you so much for the
28003200	28007680	Thanks for all the fish. I'm pretty sure that is the ending to a movie
28008240	28010640	That bill bull was in that haven't watched yet
28012080	28014880	Um, I can't remember big ones. Thanks for all the fish
28016480	28022720	Level 36. Oh my god, tuna literally a hundred a pop as well is crazy
28025200	28028800	Keeps in the bunny suit girl turn into a guy on a remain
28031040	28032480	It's because they're
28032480	28035440	Dancing on each other hitchhikers guys. Yes. I've not seen that
28036400	28041600	Good lord. You're so live. Yeah, we're tuna max and we're currently level 36
28042480	28044720	And cooking it's that purple one right there
28045600	28047120	here
28047120	28054400	We're level 36 apparently your xp per hour is like freaking 56k with the tuna. It's like going off like crazy
28061520	28063520	So much tuna
28064320	28066640	You know, it's really nice tuna cucumber meal
28068960	28072400	Like uncrusted bread. Oh, no, that's delicious
28080080	28084400	Can we cook for all salmon yet? Let me check use the salmon on the fire
28085600	28091680	With everyone's opinion on anchovy pizza. Oh, I can cook salmon. Okay. I can pick up salmon now as well
28091840	28094400	Right, I'll pick up salmon and trout so I can just like do it all
28095840	28098560	Level 50 is about 100 k xp total
28101040	28103040	Oh, it's my total xp
28104720	28110000	I am one fourth of the way to level 50. I'm not sure I can do it before mercy goes online
28111200	28113200	Oh, I'll be cutting it close. I think
28114000	28118560	Oh, no, I can I would have to be tuna maxing unless the salmon does it. I'm not sure
28119520	28121520	Unless the salmon does it
28124640	28126640	And if I stop burning everything
28129280	28131280	I'm scooping up all this truth
28134480	28136960	I'm scooping it up my inventory's getting so full
28140480	28142480	Someone's got a mini cliff
28142960	28144960	No, but that is huge
28145200	28147200	Hey
28148160	28150480	It's so fast with the salmon as well
28152560	28155600	Oh five more salmon and then level up again
28157520	28159520	Oh, come on. You can do it
28160960	28162960	Two more one more
28164480	28165840	Yes
28165840	28167840	30 freaking six
28168000	28170400	Hey 37. Sorry. I know numbers sometimes
28171680	28173360	Oh
28173360	28176720	We are tuna maxing. We are fish maxing out the wazoo right now
28179200	28181280	Johnny you can do this Johnny
28181840	28184960	Cook this scale as they start to like there's neither motor
28187120	28189120	We're gonna do it. We're gonna do it
28191120	28196400	A tuna is more xp than salmon. Salmon's more xp than trout
28197520	28202960	But I'm fortunately I'm still at the burning stage. So I'm not like maximizing my inventory right now
28204080	28205360	I
28205360	28212400	Can't I don't think there's any other quests that give cooking xp that I know of other than there's probably a ton of members quests
28212640	28214800	That do have like cooking xp
28215680	28216960	um
28216960	28219360	But as it stands right now
28220720	28222720	We'll do full inventory roster
28224800	28230320	But once we start once we stop burning then we can do like max inventory
28231120	28233120	xp gains, which is really
28233760	28235760	handy-dandy
28235760	28239440	It took me a little bit of salmon. It's taking my troop. You need my troop
28241840	28246080	Salmon might honestly be better rates when you factor in the burn rate. Mmm
28247200	28249200	It's possible
28249360	28255920	Someone else here is like syncing up the salmon, which is fine. Honestly, it's not like the trout is like bad or anything
28256560	28261200	I know we'll make it to 40 question is how far in
28264080	28271440	True mummy gaming here honestly click simulator, but it's so good though. Like runescape's on a scourge
28272240	28274240	Oh
28279760	28286320	Look it's like I love how that rune plug in or whatever it's called rune light literally absolutely annihilate now here
28288320	28294800	Salmon success rate at 38 is 74 percent. Mmm. That's not bad
28296400	28298400	Every one in four
28299280	28305040	Okay, who has the exhale spreadsheet an optimal fish cookin
28305840	28312240	The best members quest for it is the family crest so you get gloves that were just burning. Oh, I've never done
28312800	28314800	I don't know what that is actually
28316160	28320720	It sounds difficult though because for something to be such a good item
28321280	28324400	I feel like they would have put it behind like really difficult quest
28324480	28329600	Oh, if I can pick up a few of these salmon, what may I do for them?
28333280	28336800	Rune light is insane. I can never play with a vanilla client again
28338720	28340720	Get mugged
28341520	28344080	Suppose if you want like super nostalgia, you just leave it as a
28344880	28348080	Right, we'll do the trout first because I want like I don't want to
28349040	28352000	Have higher rate of burning the salmon since it offers more
28352960	28354960	Do you just stream forever strong?
28355680	28359280	Um, I just really enjoy streaming and I like hanging out with refunds
28359360	28365120	Especially on days where we get to play a multiplayer game where we get to be together. I really like that
28366560	28373360	Um, I'm actually going off a bit earlier than expected when maricy comes online in an hour. I'm raiding into our
28374400	28380640	And the only reason I'm not doing an endurance today. Hmm is because my voice is very sore
28381040	28386320	Um, and I have an ASMR stream tomorrow, so I'm gonna have to try and rest it a bit better than
28387040	28388880	than usual
28388880	28390880	than the huge
28391840	28393840	When again is this old
28395200	28396720	Um
28396720	28402720	Yes, if my voice wasn't sore, I unironically just do 12 hours again. I'm sorry. I would I said it
28403360	28407360	I said what we're all thinking you all know. Oh, oh no. I didn't cook those raw salmon
28408320	28412880	Silly billy. Oh, no, it's giving me the actual salmon. Oh, hello
28414400	28419840	I'm not salmon maxing. I'm not a real salmon max. So I can't believe it. I'm sorry. You had to all find out this way
28421280	28423280	Let's do trout
28424000	28426400	We're doing we're getting pretty good at trout. We're getting pretty good
28428080	28431920	Over eight hours not jerks. Come on. Nice. I don't know. I feel like
28432720	28436960	You know when you have like a regular nine and five job like obviously I had quite a few
28438320	28442480	And I just put it in a perspective like I'm literally memeing about in a video game
28442480	28445920	I get to like play and like have fun times with you
28447040	28449040	And it just like

28696800	28698800	We cease to exist when you leave us. No
28700960	28703760	Bitter means a bunch of things including both. Okay
28706160	28708160	My German knowledge is expanding
28710560	28714560	And now to expand my Puerto Rican knowledge
28714560	28727120	I don't know how many pets I've got. Can you own all the pets that one?
28728800	28733120	Oh, they're like a little symbol to show what one there's 24 pets
28734880	28736880	What how?
28737120	28739120	Hmm
28740640	28745200	How does there 24 there are 59 pairs? Whoa
28747360	28749360	That's a lot
28750080	28756320	Yeah, especially because I've a chain makes an avoid worker jam. Is that how you attract pets to you? You were jewelry
28757920	28760240	They're ooh shiny. Is there a magpie pet?
28760480	28762480	Oh
28765920	28771840	Actually, I've picked the place clean. That's how much I'm fish maxing. There's nothing on the ground. I've picked it clean
28772080	28775360	Oh wait, there's a trade. Ah, I'm missing
28776320	28780240	I've got rubbish aimbot. Whoa. Yeah 17 39
28781680	28787840	All salmon. Oh, we're all in on salmon salmon cook and run. We're almost level 40
28788560	28791200	40 is like a melody and
28791840	28793840	Oh, sorry, I just punched them. I can hear that
28794800	28796800	It's a little animated there
28798480	28801520	Strongly only just starts you mean she's already a 1% or something
28802320	28808400	Wait, really is level 40 a 1% thing like no like hardly anyone gets to 40 and something
28811040	28816080	Shorty's like a melody and I kind of can't keep grow. Got me singing like
28817840	28821920	Betty days like my eyes. Is it like my eyes porch stuck on the plate?
28826240	28829440	Those bars were good. She punched the reef line. I'm sorry
28832480	28837360	There's a fishing pet, but you have to be on a member's world to get it and scaling pets are especially
28838720	28840720	He means the money
28842400	28844400	We hit 40 we hit 40
28847920	28849920	Actually so good
28849920	28852080	I might make one last cup of tea
28852960	28854960	We need a lock in
28856400	28860400	Lobster time. Oh, no, I'm not gonna waste in lobster. That's crazy
28862080	28863920	I'm not gonna waste
28863920	28867520	Oh, I mean unless you give me lobsters. That's different
28868480	28873680	If you give me lobsters to waste that's different. I'm not sure what my freaking rate is gonna be
28874800	28877440	Burn them all. Oh, I kicked my first one correctly
28878720	28880720	Wow
28881600	28883600	120
28884160	28885680	Oh, no
28885680	28888480	They're getting burned. I know you can't see them over my head my heart
28889520	28892320	Can I move myself over just a tiny bit more?
28895600	28898400	I don't want it actually. Yeah. Yeah
28899920	28902960	Okay, yeah, that's better. You can like really see the inventory and stuff
28903920	28905920	Learning runes keep learning
28907840	28913680	If all the boys get 40 fishing must the point will be for pure lobs
28914800	28917680	Wait, you want to do love wait you guys stay up all night
28917760	28923120	Just so you can get 40 fishing so we can do lobster runs 120 is a lot
28924240	28929920	Look at the success rate though. Where does it say? Oh the success rate is going up. It's 20 percent
28930880	28934800	What's that going? Oh, that's my that's my uh
28938640	28941360	Oh rest well those two sleep. I'm sorry. I streamed so long
28942800	28946720	Uh, for those of you who do need to leave please don't worry. I'm literally doing this until the end
28946800	28950160	We're gonna read into mercy because my poor voice is feeling it. Mr. Proud
28950480	28954640	There's no way you already have more freaking lobsters for me or something
28955280	28957280	Oh, okay. Okay. We go pick go pick
28960400	28965040	This is crazy. Can you get in trouble by Jagex for doing this?
28966000	28972400	I can stay until 40 fish are for lobsters. That's no, that's crazy. I'm at 31 fishing at the moment
28974880	28978240	Got distracted watching you forgot to go back more
28979760	28981760	Good night seekers rest well
28981760	28984160	Then we can see how much seafood you are wasting. No
28984400	28986400	Oh
28986720	28988720	I just meant for the lobsters that one
28989440	28992080	Long streams are good because I can catch them when I wake up. Hmm
28992880	28994880	I will sleep when I'm when I'm
28995760	28999440	I'm beat by drowning by more domination achieve
29000960	29004880	Oh my god, we're almost 41 all freaking Brady. We just were for him
29005920	29008800	Sleep as a construct construct as a government. I'll never give in
29010480	29012480	Oh my gosh
29013440	29016160	Can we do it? Can we make it 41 already?
29019280	29023920	One more don't burn them. No, don't burn them. She I'm she burned it
29025520	29027520	40 freaking one
29029680	29031680	This is so good
29033600	29036400	Oh my god, you're already trading with me
29039360	29042080	I hope I can't get in trouble by Jagex for this
29043440	29046480	Stuff like this can run the game for new players. So be careful about donations
29049680	29054560	I have played like I do have a basic concept of the game, but like if you're gonna ask me to do like
29055440	29060080	Dungeoning and stuff. I could not tell you where the gargoyles are, but apparently gargoyles
29060560	29063760	Hey, stroney, how do you get a fishing rod? I've never tried this before
29064720	29066720	Oh, I'm your tiny culls. Um
29067600	29074080	You would have to level up with that fishing net you got from tutorial island, but you can't use it here
29074080	29076080	You would have to go back to lumbridge
29077040	29084320	This is lumbridge where you came from you can use the magic spell to teleport and you have to do net fishing here until 20
29085040	29087440	And then you can come here for a fly fishing
29088880	29090880	I'm so sorry little reasoning
29091200	29095040	There are gates to level up on fishing. They're probably a lot better than my method
29095040	29097040	But that's why I've always used as a kid
29097600	29102160	Gargoyles are decent money for mid players, but 75 slurs probably the slowest and
29104160	29107680	That burn rates looking a bit rough on the lobsters. I'm not gonna lie
29108400	29113120	Anyone got some feathers on them. So well, I guess I'll go great. Oh, thank you little weaklings
29115360	29117360	That burn rate is looking rough
29118880	29120880	Oh
29120880	29122880	About it
29123520	29125520	How do you sense the lobsters?
29125840	29127840	I feel like they're probably breaking through here
29129280	29132400	We're burnt through the fish already. No, we've not I tell a lie
29133200	29136960	There's freaking who are you coming so fast like
29138160	29141120	You you just handed me them. Is there a bank nearby?
29143360	29146560	I thought the bank was over there. Am I going crazy is there a bank up there?
29147840	29150560	He's just disappeared again. Is there a bank up there?
29151840	29154560	Ageville has a bank. Oh, I'll make sure you
29156400	29164880	Call meville because I don't know if I could trade. I'm so sorry. Wait, I'll trade. I'm sorry. I'll trade. I'll trade. I'll trade
29168080	29170080	Okay, I'll trade I'll trade
29170240	29172240	I'll trade I'll trade
29175120	29177120	Bro's hacking
29177360	29181840	Can you even hack in RuneScape? That sounds like it's nice and possible because of the way the server is
29182240	29185680	Call meville because I'm edging. Yes. Call meville because I'm edging
29189840	29191840	Came up with that myself
29193680	29197360	You could start using a range closer to the bank rather than the fire rate
29198080	29202240	Since you're not fishing anymore, probably that's very true
29208720	29211360	Oh, that burn rate is rough on those lobbies
29212720	29219200	Every lobster that we burn is a missing like 120 which is like so freaking thingy. I lied. I made it
29220160	29223360	Wait, there's another reef link. There's a judge, right? Hold on
29224320	29227120	Wait, you've got lobster runs as well
29230240	29236240	Isn't this not like thousands like thousands of gold? Am I not going mental? I feel like this is like thousands
29236240	29238640	Go ahead and run energy needs to recharge
29240720	29242720	Whoa, we got a four streak
29242720	29244320	Five in a row?
29244320	29246320	42
29247280	29249280	Yeah
29250960	29254000	It depends on how fast you want to get this level, but our village is more
29256160	29258480	Inic, the most cooking ranges
29263840	29265840	You can make a million per hour
29268160	29272560	A million xp per hour at strony even if they're sizing you have already been given millions
29273280	29277040	Honestly, if you tape exclamation mark praise what?
29281040	29284560	Stop did you make me fall for something obvious?
29284560	29286560	I don't know
29298720	29306080	Yeah, I spent 160 on 2k that's like two boss kills. Yeah, you have to take that I'm afterwards. Oh
29308080	29314000	Oh, oh need drop need drop. Oh, yeah, that was a much better lobster cooking batch than the previous one
29314080	29316080	The other one I absolutely
29319600	29321600	Oh
29323280	29325280	All right, okay, take that
29326320	29331520	Let's try and do this exclamation mark price let all this sit at our
29335520	29337520	Oh it works
29338240	29340240	Are there 150 a pack?
29340880	29346080	Oh, if I buy if I buy feathers from people we drop on okay 300k
29348640	29352160	Right don't buy any more fish because it's literally I've got
29352720	29358160	Uh less than 50 minutes now. I'm gonna go quickly grab a bottle of water
29370240	29372240	Oh
29389040	29394880	Oh, I hear burning noises because we're burning the fishes right I got a new ball of war
29395840	29403600	I'm so hydrated, but I don't want to pee. I want to fish max. I need to fish max. You don't understand. I'm fish maxing. You wouldn't get it
29405520	29410320	I have lobby maxing you wouldn't get it. You wouldn't understand mom. Mom. I need membership
29415840	29417840	I'll give it a try be back
29418240	29420240	Gobble
29420240	29423600	I've only been listening to ASMR for about a minute. So I'm excited for starting ASMR. Wow
29424800	29429840	I definitely am not the best. I would say like uh mersey and ac really super professional
29432720	29434800	43
29434800	29439760	And we've had a lot of two stacks. Oh, I was about to say we've got two stack for all of the lobbies not being burnt
29441200	29443200	Spoke too soon there
29446400	29448400	Hydration check
29450960	29452960	You
29454640	29460640	Know as much as the chef hat and the apron are made out of gold. I don't think it's actually making me a better chef
29465440	29468400	How much longer before you have to leave is the exact time
29468720	29470960	Mersey is coming on in 45 minutes
29470960	29476000	I'm gonna redirect into her because I need to do vocal rest before the ASMR stream tomorrow
29476400	29480640	And it hurts to talk right now, which is a shame. It's literally the only reason I'm going offline
29480720	29483360	I've probably done during stream every single day if I kill it honestly
29484560	29489200	Oh, but my voice is sore and I need to be quiet for the ASMR
29490320	29494640	Uh tomorrow's gonna be a short no you guys are so quick on it
29496240	29498240	This is crazy
29498240	29500880	It doesn't make sense. They're gold literally
29501120	29508480	Doing some nice hot tea. Yes. I've had too much tea to do because I put honey in my tea. It gets like
29509280	29513280	Sickly if I have too much of it. So I have to swap a water only
29514800	29520960	What's your target that you're going for this stream? I wanted to get 50, but I don't think it's possible because of time
29521840	29525440	I didn't realize how fast cooking the fish was gonna be
29526160	29531360	If I wasn't like doing those quests, but I had fun doing quests for the weasel and so actually I don't really regret at all
29532240	29537040	It's I'll be cutting it close like if we're literally like a couple of minutes away, then I'll do it
29537600	29539600	But unfortunately my voice is like
29541200	29543920	I'm the most I felt that one literally
29545520	29547520	I do look stylish though. I mean look at that
29548480	29550480	Oh
29552080	29556880	Look at the detail in my eyes and everything the polys is favorite all the going
29558640	29564560	Honey team's good. Maybe add less honey. I don't know. I feel like sickly if I
29565920	29567920	It's just not working
29568640	29570640	It's just not working
29571760	29573200	I know
29573200	29577200	Um, you can have those throat sweets, but I don't know if they actually do anything
29577520	29583600	Or just like make my teeth feel a little sugary. It's like my biggest freaking thing. Wait, hold on. Am I taking
29584320	29586320	I can't remember who I keep taking off all
29587520	29592400	I'm sorry for whoever the other lobster runners. Like I like I can't remember between
29593680	29596240	200 k feathers under me. Damn
29597440	29599440	Damn
29599680	29601680	Damn, you're in a wedding dress and everything
29603200	29609680	All of you black hair. This is you and your little cape. Oh, I forgot to get his green capes. Oops. We'll do the next thing
29611040	29613440	Can you say throw sweets again? Yeah, throw sweets
29614480	29618960	They like help with your throat when you feel sick or whatever or if you've got strain again
29621360	29628500	You're still screaming. Yeah, um, we've got roughly 40 minutes and then it's mercy time. We're gonna redirect into mercy
29633600	29635600	Oh
29638480	29646560	I'm making an absolute mockery of this one. I think I'm gonna burn there. Yeah over close to the 44 though
29650560	29652560	Rikola
29653200	29655200	Wait Rikola
29658080	29660080	Wait, what's Rikola?
29661040	29663040	I can hear that Rikola
29673920	29678720	A tape of throat lozenger. Oh, it's a cough drug. Rikola is a brand
29679280	29681280	Oh, okay. Oh, sorry
29683280	29685280	Here you go
29686080	29691600	Lobster runner, I can't believe it. Might as well do 99 rune crafting while we're at it. You guys will make it super easy
29695280	29700080	It's the comical jingle that was very common. Oh, it's a commercial jingle. Sorry
29701840	29703840	I see I see I see
29704720	29707200	But not ac smoke but I see
29710080	29712080	There's a new
29712960	29714960	New rune craft minigame and it's fun
29715680	29720960	Anyone else? They won't see the feathers yet. No, you might have to pick them up in case it's too much when you despawn
29723280	29725280	No feathers
29728560	29732080	Yeah, hopefully they don't despawn because 20k feathers isn't cheap
29735680	29737680	Did you time this
29742480	29745440	How long does it take after dolphin? I thought it was 60 seconds
29746800	29752800	If it's been 60 seconds, I would scoop them back up again because I would hate for them to no not the head buy-ins
29760480	29762480	Level 40 freaking four
29764880	29768080	If I could stop freaking burning them lobsters, oh wow
29768880	29770880	Well, accept trade accept trade
29779120	29787360	We're getting there though. Do you have less burn chance on a grill thing? An oven? A grill thing
29788960	29795360	30 seconds to appear to others three minutes to despawn. Hmm. We're learning. We're learning the ways of runes game
29798400	29800400	You
29801920	29803920	Know only
29807840	29811440	Range and fire are the same kissing chance mostly. Okay, there's no point
29812080	29815040	I was like, maybe we should move this production line
29815600	29816640	but
29816640	29820160	And the the reef ones are just fishing away. They're just having a good time
29822720	29824960	We definitely need to level ourselves up
29825920	29831520	Because we're we're the target for like a lot of NPCs like when we're trying to travel through areas
29832800	29834800	So
29836640	29841360	Streams end in 40 minutes. Does that mean brush teeth intend? Oh, yes. We have to brush your teeth
29843520	29847200	Okay, thank goodness I didn't make another tea because I wouldn't have been able to brush my teeth
29848160	29849760	Uh
29849760	29852640	If you're having if you want to brush your teeth with us
29853360	29856160	Um for your enamel don't
29857280	29859280	Eat or drink fizzy juice
29859680	29864320	You can have water for like the next 30 minutes, but you're not to brush your teeth if you've eaten
29865280	29867040	after 30 minutes
29867040	29870160	Because it hurts your enamel that rather than helping it
29871360	29874240	I think that's my only note if you want to brush your teeth with us
29875200	29882240	It's not so fun story. My brother once choked on one of those throat sweeps and helped with the throat throat
29883920	29885920	Oh, that's terrifying
29887200	29889200	45
29889760	29896400	45 45 we're at 61 eight feet. Oh my goodness. We may actually make the 50. You know that
29897360	29899360	I
29900400	29904080	Throat farted when I swallowed it. Did you hear that? That was like an internal throat
29906560	29910720	Strony is the cuttlefish and the reeflings are her arms. Most people think it's like
29917840	29919840	One in three
29919840	29921840	Oh
29923920	29931440	He learned so much from this education on professional streamer that takes me back to the toothbrush and ASMR
29939360	29942560	We are so gonna get 50 before mercy comes on a mind me funny
29943360	29947920	Oh mercy is actually I think she's decorating alternative outfits for us
29948880	29950240	So
29950240	29952240	We are in
29952800	29958240	Have our lobster reserves run dry. Have I perished all the lobsters for sale in the grand exchange?
29960080	29962580	Oh unless unless unless
29964560	29969120	There you guys are sweating to get me to level 99 you're actually so kind
29969120	29973040	I just want to say special. Thank you for those of you who are like unironically feeding me
29973600	29976320	This is gonna make the school way faster doing this
29978160	29980160	Hmm
29986240	29988240	You'd say that strong he's a really good drop. What?
29989840	29992560	Do you think she'd meet you one of those? What?
29994160	29998640	What's going on? No stops on this lobster train. Literally
30002960	30004960	I know the fishing spot
30008640	30011520	Nearly 1 million xp an hour stop is it?
30012320	30014080	unblockies
30014080	30016080	I love stories
30016160	30020640	I suppose if I didn't burn them that's very plausible every stack is like
30022160	30024160	What 26 inventory?
30025600	30027600	Like
30027840	30029920	I think five tables are shooting it. I don't know
30031680	30036640	With some tick manipulation. I don't know what's the tick rate manipulation stuff means
30036720	30038720	I hear it all the time though
30038960	30041840	It's like, oh, you just gotta make sure you do this on the tick and you have to eat
30042080	30046880	You have to eat the food on the tick. Oh, can I swap out prayer? I need prayer flick. I need a prayer flick
30046960	30048960	Like I'm like, what does any of this mean?
30051600	30053440	You're crazy
30053440	30055440	crazy
30056240	30060800	Also for those of you using ruin light if you don't want an item name to show up
30061600	30067120	Can hold all and write the irons
30069200	30071200	We're getting them
30074320	30077200	Being an apron has always been a dream of mine
30078720	30083200	The game runs on 0.6 second increments called ticks. That's it. Oh
30086640	30090160	That basic okay, that just like explains everything
30091760	30095760	That's it. That's all it took one one sense and it all makes sense
30096160	30099520	Okay, because I was like prayer. I need prayer flick on this
30100400	30102400	Over prayer flail. I'm like, what?
30103040	30105520	I'm not I'm even sure that's supposed to be having the games played
30105520	30111440	I don't know did the devs intend that but they never patched it out. So I guess prayer flicking is the right way to go
30112960	30114960	Because prayer run drains so fast
30115840	30122800	It's running smart. I'm I'm I'm getting new brain cells just from streaming. Hmm
30124880	30126880	Level 47
30126960	30128400	No
30128400	30130400	Oh wait, sorry
30130960	30133920	Two more if I don't burn these if I don't burn this one
30136320	30139760	46 oh my gosh
30141040	30143040	We're so MLG pro
30143840	30145840	Look at me bro MLG pro
30147680	30150800	I'm gonna come he's rumbling if you could hear that over the background
30151920	30153920	Wow
30154720	30156720	I'm literally solid
30158320	30161040	It's not intended but jaguars just accept it
30161040	30164960	I was gonna say if they didn't whenever like something gets discovered
30165520	30170080	Like so this is for the overwatch players, but mercy had a guardian angel leak. Um
30170400	30172400	And
30172560	30178880	It got discovered and it was never patched out the game which meant it was intended even though it was never described
30179840	30182400	So that's how I take it if the devs don't patch it out
30183120	30185120	It's allowed basically
30186320	30189360	Once you get to level 92 you're halfway there. Yay
30191040	30193920	Anyway, congrats dumb dumb. This was the stream I was looking forward
30194640	30197680	The list ended up probably being one of the funniest really
30198640	30202480	It's just me receiving like tons of in-game currency for doing nothing
30205280	30210080	Yes, but please don't worry if you're interested in a more like multiplayer games where we can play together
30210560	30215280	Um, I definitely am doing like a whole variety of things going on. Um
30220480	30223120	I would definitely like other ones like um
30223920	30229600	Jail, no, that's not its official name. What's the name of the game? Uh fall guys
30230320	30236720	Um, I wanted to give fortnite a chance apparently fortnite. Um has added like different game modes
30237440	30243920	Um, uh call of duty has apparently introduced prop hunt. I don't know if we could oh, there's a captain
30244000	30246480	Do we do the captain mini one mini quest?
30248160	30250160	I don't know if we do the captain one
30250400	30252400	At the fortnite
30253360	30255360	metal path
30255680	30257680	I just shit out my head
30258960	30260160	It's
30260160	30262160	Is it bad?
30263360	30265360	Is it a bad quest?
30265360	30267360	Is it the captain or is it a good one?
30268160	30270400	It's quick. Okay, if it's quick, let's try it

30409520	30411520	I
30413120	30415120	Among us
30415920	30419200	You've never played among us deep rock galactica
30420160	30422160	We can play deep rock together
30422720	30425520	Can I force you guys to play that mains of maria game with me?
30427600	30431600	I'm too scared to ask the girls to play in case they absolutely despise it so
30432960	30434960	Although I may be able to convince she be
30435760	30443840	There's a mains of mario game. It's like it's literally deep rock galactica, but lord of the rings could it
30445840	30449440	You want to try warframe is freeing up to four man squads. Oh
30451760	30454000	I think you can force us to do anything you want to try
30454560	30456560	I
30460720	30465360	Haven't ever heard of it and never got advertised well the only reason it popped up for me is because
30465760	30468000	I'm on lord of the rings side of tech talk
30469200	30473120	So if there's anything lord of the rings lord that the rings related
30474000	30476000	Oh my god, we're gonna level up
30476880	30478880	40 freaking seven
30480080	30482080	Oh my gosh
30483040	30487200	This is getting insane xp game oh crap
30489840	30497120	Thank you. Thank you reeflings. I appreciate it. Literally everyone feeding to me. We're all like fishing away leveling up and stuff
30501520	30503520	Um, I think we'll play
30504480	30506480	RuneScape during
30507040	30513840	Uh on the third week of streams, I think they'll might we'll might do a double runescape to make sure we really get there xp
30513840	30514400	wise
30514400	30519280	I'll break it up in between the week just so it's not like a full day of runescape and then one right after it
30519520	30523360	Because I know runescape isn't for everyone. I know it might be a bit um
30523920	30526880	Of a snooze fest, but for me it's so satisfying like
30527920	30529920	Not bigger number
30530240	30532880	Bigger number big number big number big number
30533440	30535440	Like it's like really good for me
30535680	30541200	But I guess maybe watching it. It might be better. Like if it was a compilation or like a highlight, you know
30542880	30547840	Still do warframe. It's the worst game to be a new player and 100% confusing and there's a neat tutorial
30548240	30551040	Deep rock season five is a bit of a horror show right now
30556560	30558560	Number go up
30559520	30566000	RuneScape is definitely a talking stream like a datzu like back and forth. I like memeing with one each other
30567200	30569200	I'm like learning about the game and stuff
30570960	30576880	I don't know enough about runescape. Literally. I like I I wasn't kidding when I said like the best I did as a kid was like
30577680	30583200	Do cooking and then like probably like do 40 and then that's the best like I actually don't know how the game works
30584720	30587280	So much lobster rock lobster
30588560	30590560	Dumb
30599040	30601040	Uh b52 is anyone
30605600	30607600	The reefing
30607840	30615840	Is could you trouble you to play voices of the void? I don't know what that is. Is that an mmo or like single
30616800	30618800	Or what what kind of game
30620800	30622800	This reefing is deep one
30623040	30625040	final fantasy 14
30626240	30628240	I was gonna give it a shot
30628960	30630960	um
30631360	30633360	But yeah
30634560	30636560	I never ended up playing it
30636800	30640000	I don't know if it's I don't know if they say the role play a lot on it
30640960	30642400	honestly
30642400	30644400	I don't mind
30644640	30646640	It'll be fun to role play
30649600	30651600	A role play is what
30654560	30656560	I don't know what
30667280	30669280	Oh, wait, sorry
30670960	30672960	Save heroes is free to play
30675280	30679200	Super hero animal. Oh, I think I said I wanted to play Marvel rivals
30679200	30684880	We might play that but I don't know if it's in beta beta beta beta
30685280	30689680	Um, or if that's it fully out. I don't know. Oh my tummy's wobbling
30691120	30692960	I don't know what to do
30692960	30696720	Stroney and our 100 husbands isn't this the life though
30699440	30702240	You know, you have to wait to get your one-on-one attention
30702320	30710400	But then that makes it so much more worth it. Why did I keep freaking snail blinking? I'm gonna have to change that
30712000	30714560	Please stop blinking one at a time
30716560	30718560	I'm gonna have to make this sensitivity
30719040	30720800	different
30720800	30722400	any
30722400	30724880	interest in trying lord of the rings online
30725440	30727440	I
30729040	30730160	Like
30730160	30736560	Shadow and what lord of the rings online? You mean elven scrolls online or is there like a lord of the rings online?
30736560	30738560	I have no idea about
30740880	30745280	I'm actually playing final fantasy while watching the stream speaking facts cannot disagree
30747920	30751680	I work in accounting and I'm the only guy with nine girls and that was a
30752240	30756480	What ladies man, check you out. You get a nice view all day long
30758560	30761680	There's a lord of the rings. Maybe I've seen it and I'm just being a dumb dumb
30763760	30766320	I can't recall it off the toilet in the head
30772320	30777520	Should I move I feel like I'm like in the way here. Oh, I can't even access the fire. Oh
30778240	30780240	I can't even access the fire
30781200	30784000	Dumb dumb. Oh, sorry. I'm already accepted
30785280	30788720	It's pretty old. Does lord of the rings online still even have server? Yeah, I don't even
30789360	30791360	I don't even think I've seen any gameplay of it
30792240	30795200	Unless I have and my brain's just not putting them two together
30796560	30801920	171 successful cooks to go. Not sure how many include in burning. So probably 10 more trips
30803200	30804480	Wow
30804480	30806480	We're at 81,000
30806880	30813280	XP on cooking we need 20k more wins mercy 20 minutes on mercy. I don't know
30816400	30818400	If we could stop burning
30821120	30825200	There's no way you're still head banging over there. Are you not tired of clicking the button?
30828000	30836080	Finally lord of the ring is microtransaction to heck. Okay, that's probably why I haven't heard about it because everyone just saw how much of a grab it was
30837440	30842000	I lost my little face. Yeah, maybe I am maybe I'm just head banging
30843600	30850160	I mean barb village is it? Yeah, I don't I we might maybe do like a watch along of stuff
30850960	30852960	and
30853280	30856800	For like the later levels oh 48 man
30858000	30863760	That's so good. I literally I was aiming for 40 and I'm like so happy with what we've got
30863840	30870960	Obviously special shout out to the reeflings who are supplying a ridiculous amount of money and fish and everything to me
30871440	30873440	Because it is insane
30876160	30879040	And literally the reeflings down here that are just chilling and fishing away there
30879120	30881120	They're just having a good time leveling up fishing
30881840	30886880	What are your fishing levels? Hold on. Let me type fishing level check
30887840	30889840	Fishing level check
30894640	30897920	I'm still struggling early game fishing and cooking south of lombardy shrimp
30898320	30902480	It takes forever to net some shrimp and then you burn them to heck
30903120	30907360	If you guys want to catch up to her, I'll give you what I have left after stream
30910160	30913840	Out of curiosity, are you avoiding profanity for any reason?
30914480	30916400	a little bit the ai
30916400	30923120	Can tell like the ai can read what my voice is so I kind of try and swap out words over time
30924240	30926240	um because I am quite
30927040	30932640	Outrageous at certain sections, so I try and tone it down as long as you get like a good 80 to any like mix
30933280	30936720	Then overall you're fine, which is why I swap out words sometimes
30939360	30942240	I have enough eggs to be for night night twice unfortunately
30943680	30946720	Little reeflings cute surprise of the stream
30948240	30950240	Oh we keep burning them
30950560	30952560	Ah
30952960	30959200	Oh lobbies you're not as easy to cook as I I thought my little my caviar
30968080	30974080	Yes, I maybe need to think of like maybe we watch movies and that whilst we runescape in the background or something
30974960	30976960	I mean I can do set up watch one movie
30977920	30982800	And obviously I can't show it back and show the timer so as we jump in at any point
30983360	30985920	Maybe harry potter. Do you guys like harry potter?
30988560	30991760	I've watched it through for the first time
30992800	30999600	A couple years back. I'm not doing the full thing not okay. Maybe not. Sorry. Sorry. Maybe not. Maybe it's the girls movie. Apologies
31001600	31006240	Is there a see John wick series? We'll watch the John wick series
31007040	31009040	Movies that would be a good one
31011120	31017520	Hmm, I think everyone who's ready for runescape and chill honestly John wick runescape and chill
31018720	31024240	I'll put down the sound of the game like really low and we'll just watch the movie and it's just me going
31025280	31028240	In the movie and then every time I level up I also go
31031200	31035600	The first three movies of harry potter is pretty comfortable. Yeah, I guess really dark at the end which I don't
31036400	31039440	You could do a pool on which movies. Yeah
31041120	31043440	Uh just because of how long
31044720	31049600	Like the grains are I would kind of want to do series movies and um
31052560	31057440	John wick has three installments. I'm pretty sure which is why I quite like that
31058400	31060400	Hmm
31063360	31069200	What about shrek? Oh, I don't like the leader shirt. Is it shrek happily ever after?
31075040	31077040	John wick has four
31079520	31085680	Have I seen the fourth one? I might know you haven't seen the fourth one. I don't know there's a fourth installment
31086640	31088640	Huh
31089520	31094320	I have a silly idea. What's your idea? Hmm. You have me curious speak your truth
31095200	31097200	Stroney, how do you feel about spider-man movies?
31097920	31102000	You want to watch the original spider-man's like the toby mcguire?
31102880	31105760	Spider-man so we can all have a gig a lot of the dancing
31107920	31109920	Toby mcguire is my spider-man
31110160	31116160	I remember it like a freaking babbling and watching the movies practically
31119040	31122960	Yeah, the fourth the final chapter is the fourth. Oh, okay, okay, okay
31125440	31130400	Stroney, did you know that lord of the rings trilogy lasts less than one of your endurance streams?
31130800	31136000	I'm saving myself. I'm saving myself for the lord of the rings on christmas day
31136560	31140720	I am abstaining from such beautiful literature
31141680	31145440	Uh, such beautiful media that was created for human consumption
31146320	31148320	Um, so
31148400	31150400	We're not gonna watch them
31151520	31153520	for this
31154960	31158160	The sam remi trilogy. Yeah, spider-man 3
31158960	31163920	I don't think I saw that one. I didn't see any of the spider-man's that have emma stone in it
31166960	31168960	But I watched spider-man
31170000	31172240	We're all three of them. We're in the same movie
31174400	31179040	And toby was like, yeah, it just comes out of my wrist and the other two were like, huh?
31180240	31182560	Because I couldn't believe it because I think the new
31183600	31190960	Oh, I'm really bad with people's names. The new spider-man has to use nanotechnology from iron man to get his gunk out
31192400	31194400	Um, I don't know what
31195360	31197360	Garfield
31197360	31199920	Honestly, any of the spider-man movies views are great. Okay
31201680	31207040	49. Oh my gosh 49 just popped feels good, man
31208960	31211280	Tom Holland. Aye, his name's Tom Holland
31217120	31221760	I sing the praises of the apocrity diaries to anyone who will listen. Is it movie?
31222720	31228480	I'm not heard of it. If it's a game or a movie
31233840	31235840	Oh, my tummy's so hungry
31237360	31241920	But I can't make food. I must grind. I must fish max. We are fish maxing
31244880	31248720	We hitting 50 before mercy before I think so
31249600	31252880	We are like blasting through these levels. It's crazy
31255120	31257600	0.7 of the weight of 99 let's go
31260080	31262080	Oh, I read apocrity novel
31263520	31265520	Aren't there like seven Highlander movies?
31267360	31271200	It's mad max a one-off movie. I think so
31272560	31275600	That new mad max I think is good
31276160	31279600	The one that was like witness me and he puts spray can on his teeth
31280960	31282960	That one's pretty good
31284080	31290240	Those one-off movies are oh, sorry. I just click I miss click. Oh, sorry. Sorry the grind the grind, please
31290480	31293200	The lobster maxing. I can't do it if I'm all miss clicking
31293920	31295920	It was a miss input miss input
31296480	31298480	Fury road was one
31299600	31303680	XP waste no, don't bully me over my xp wasting
31306080	31314080	It says I need 54 cooks and I've got 5th level 50 if I can stop burning them. Maybe two more inventory's of lobbies
31315840	31317840	Oh, maybe two we can do it into
31321760	31323760	We're
31324080	31330800	If only I know how many hours I spent bank standing. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry
31331040	31333040	I
31333520	31335520	Think your ping may be blessed
31337120	31339680	Get that fire on get that fire on get that lobby on the fire
31341200	31343200	Not the miss input
31344800	31347920	Blade runner. Oh, that's a good suggestion
31351680	31353280	I thought about
31353280	31355680	because of the rile ryan
31356320	31357920	Gosling ryan gosling
31357920	31361600	But I don't know why that was so hard to say ryan because of the ryan goslin movies
31361840	31367280	I thought it would be funny if we did like a six girl watch along of it like all six of us watching it
31367840	31373840	And then whenever ryan comes on screen all of us can be like, oh, that's literally my refling
31373920	31378640	That's literally my like fleeting heart. That's literally my snippet. That's literally my pinpal
31379200	31381200	Oh
31382800	31384800	I'm on world 380
31385760	31392320	At barbarian village. Unfortunately. I'm literally about to go off in 13 minutes rip because mercy is coming online
31394080	31397200	And literally oh my god, that's my refill a bit. Oh my god. My roof was so strong
31398480	31400800	I'm gonna just be like complimenting you the entire stream
31401600	31412560	Okay, it says 34 more lobsters. Okay, this time two more inventories. I'll do it because I can't stop burning these lobbies
31418000	31420000	That goes like literally
31421040	31424800	I wouldn't mind rewatching the blade runner because I didn't like fully comprehend it
31426400	31428400	I'm at first
31428960	31432880	So it'd be nice to like see again kind of mildly knowing what happens
31433600	31435600	Have you watched seven cycle path?
31436160	31439680	Movie before no, I haven't I'm not sure what that is that gosling
31440400	31442400	literally
31443920	31445920	Can't wait to see us all together again
31446560	31451600	Can't wait as well. We've got our first group collab and then we've got our one-on-one collabs coming out soon tm
31452560	31458720	Um, so I'm I'm a see can I please stop burning these lobbies, please?
31472400	31474320	Um
31474320	31480880	I think you said a little bit before we're a little bit limited on multiplayer games that we can all play together
31481280	31487120	So I think I will encourage like some trio collabs or quad man collabs at some point
31488560	31490560	and
31491040	31493040	But uh
31494720	31497520	It'll be fun to see everyone's like dynamically with each other
31498720	31500720	I hope no one's scared of me
31500880	31502880	Stranny smells. How dare you
31503920	31507600	How do your accusations? I smell like burnt lobster
31508160	31510160	burnt shrimp burnt trout
31510560	31512560	burnt salmon burnt pike
31513120	31517440	I smell like burnt everything because I can't stop freaking messing up
31517840	31521040	I need to kick 13 lobsters in the snatch and I level up
31521600	31525040	And I burn three in a row. Of course when I say that four in a row
31527200	31529200	That's more like it
31529680	31531680	Trying to upset me video game
31532480	31534480	working
31534560	31536560	I saw the fish she's handling
31536800	31538800	I
31539120	31544160	Looking forward to main crash shenanigans. Yeah, that's in july july shenanigans
31546320	31548320	I'm not beating the burning
31548480	31555360	Eating strong. He's burnt food same way up. Oh, no, those are carcinogenic. You're not supposed to eat burnt any kind of food
31557360	31563600	Wait, why did she smell like fish? We're the ones who question. Oh, we did it. We're 50
31566640	31574800	We actually did it. No way mercy's up in 10. Oh, no, we got 50. That's insane. Thank you so much. Really crap
31578800	31580800	50
31581040	31583040	Wow
31583280	31587440	And that was like messing about questing as well and all that
31588000	31590000	I
31591840	31597360	Look forward to less burning and maybe so congrats on his food
31598560	31605840	I hope I'll stop burning. Oh my god. I'm so MLG pro at cooking fish
31611680	31613680	I'll send the cringe
31614400	31617760	It says the values 2.3k for that batch of lobsters
31619840	31621840	I thought lobsters were a money maker
31626000	31629840	Okay, well, I hope see you play old school again. Yeah, um, we're playing it
31631040	31635840	We'll play it once next week on week two and then we'll play it twice on week three
31637040	31642960	Um during the week, but I'll split it up just in case because I know that runescape isn't the most interesting
31643840	31645840	Not anymore with all the bots
31648080	31650400	Maybe the bots aren't so bad after all
31651040	31653680	Controversy you can't say that you can't say that
31656000	31660720	They wear a really long time ago. I'm wondering if that's one remember like I used to think they're so expensive
31661680	31663680	Bots keep the lobsters cheap
31664080	31666160	I'm wondering
31666160	31669120	like how the economy in runescape would look if
31670000	31671440	bots
31671440	31676400	Were like completely forbidden like if they managed to like completely eradicate them
31677920	31681680	I'm wondering if it would be an uproar because everything would get so expensive
31682560	31684560	You know
31685280	31687280	Curious curious
31692720	31694720	We're learning we're learning
31695680	31700160	Stony iron man win. Oh good luck with that. Are you joking?
31701280	31706320	Isn't it's hardcore iron man. You can't use buying iron man is war
31707840	31709840	You lose everything when you perish
