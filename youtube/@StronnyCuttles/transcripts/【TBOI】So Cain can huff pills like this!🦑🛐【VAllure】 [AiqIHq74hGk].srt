1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:29,920
I think the test is in twickels.

2
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:32,920
Are you there? I'm on? I'm alive?

3
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:34,920
Woman! Reeling!

4
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:38,920
Good morning! Good evening! Good afternoon!

5
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:43,920
I know. I'm a whole six minutes early. What's going on? What's happening?

6
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:46,920
Isaac's a bit loud. I thought that.

7
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:50,920
You know what? I actually thought Isaac was a bit loud.

8
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:55,920
Oh my god, my controller isn't on. Of course it's not. How embarrassing.

9
00:00:56,920 --> 00:01:01,920
I'm going to go into a match because I think the actual game volume is lower.

10
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:04,920
Of course we get burn in basement. Relax.

11
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:10,920
Oh my god, wait. I haven't done hardcore angels?

12
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:14,920
Wow. Terrible.

13
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:19,920
Who are you and what have you done with mommy? She's never early. I know. She's always fucking late.

14
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:26,920
Right. Updates. I've got good updates. You're going to like this.

15
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:31,920
Is Isaac still too loud?

16
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:35,920
You know what? I'll put it down again. I'll put it down a wee bit more.

17
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:42,920
So I did a community post where you can submit.

18
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:49,920
If you didn't know, I did a community post and you can literally tell me what words you want me to say or phrases.

19
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:53,920
A lot of people have given me phrases which I'm surprised about.

20
00:01:53,920 --> 00:02:01,920
But I'm basically taking screenshots of what you guys are saying

21
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:06,920
and then I'm going to do like a 60, like a one hour.

22
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:19,920
The caught fish is never early nor is it too late. It will arrive safely on stream when it meets you.

23
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:25,920
God, there's how many chicks like unironically watch me. I'm getting asked.

24
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:30,920
So good girl.

25
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:39,920
I succeed. Oh, if you want to play along with it. And before I lose this and you guys are like, I'm still doing the run. Smile.

26
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:46,920
But yeah. If you want that, there's a community post.

27
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:52,920
I have officially written or sent away all the content

28
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:56,920
for the ASMR collabs I have with other creators.

29
00:02:56,920 --> 00:03:03,920
Okay. It took me so long to do. I have 11 confirmed ASMR 101 collabs.

30
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:14,920
And it took me so long to get there. But I've done 11, which means when I've wrapped up, that's 11% of my freaking goals, my objectives.

31
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:21,920
So if I keep on track, I should be able to do finish my goals within a year because I wanted to do that.

32
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:25,920
I don't know if I can do the Xbox goal. That seems like a second year goal.

33
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:34,920
I'm going to be so happy because she woke up. I am God's EPS soldier right now.

34
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:43,920
But yes, I did that. I took a look into doing the clipping program.

35
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:54,920
So if you're an established clipping channel, it looks like we can basically match Idol End's offer, which is a dollar a pair of 1000 views.

36
00:03:54,920 --> 00:04:01,920
A pair accepted clip channel. So that will be something that comes out in August.

37
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:10,920
The video game for a viewer is definitely looking like August, sadly.

38
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:19,920
I fucked up my artwork. I'm really upset, but I've kind of... I've done it now. I've made a mistake. I've learned from my mistakes.

39
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:25,920
So if Gen 2 and 3, if and when, do come out with a video game, they're going to be correct.

40
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:32,920
I'm very lucky that I fucked up on my specific artwork and not someone else's specific artwork.

41
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:39,920
Aces is fine, Emmys is fine, Azuras is fine, Merces is fine, Shibys is fine. It's mine I fucked up on.

42
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:46,920
So I'm really glad it was mine because mistakes were made, things were learned along the way.

43
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:54,920
But next time when it comes to animated alternative art, it's much wiser to just go to the person

44
00:04:54,920 --> 00:05:01,920
that draws and animates it, not get it drawn elsewhere and then animated by someone else

45
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:10,920
because that's how things get messed up and my section is supposed to be banal,

46
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:17,920
but instead it's turned into hot dogging, but the audio I recorded is for banal and I don't know what to do.

47
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:28,920
I think I'm going to leave my original audio type in, but unfortunately the artwork doesn't match the section correctly.

48
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:35,920
So yeah, that's my update about my section in the video game.

49
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:44,920
But look, mistakes happen and I will say, I have learned so much and I'm so happy that I could even learn...

50
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:49,920
I can even learn to commission a video game, I know it sounds silly but...

51
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:01,920
But yeah, is there a scene where it works properly?

52
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:12,920
So yes, everyone has an animated scene, but my type is banal but the animation is hot dogging

53
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:15,920
because that was a mistake on my part.

54
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:20,920
The animator didn't know that he was supposed to make it disappear.

55
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:22,920
Hocus pocus.

56
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:31,920
But anyway, I messed up, but look, lessons learned, things have happened.

57
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:38,920
I had a cute night with my dad, he wanted to watch me play meccosal and I was like, oh god, oh god.

58
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:40,920
Because I was like, what did I see in the stream?

59
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:44,920
But we actually did see him watch it and it wasn't that bad.

60
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:48,920
I honestly wasn't that bad that stream, I could have been way worse.

61
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:54,920
But he was like, oh my god, I remember all that and I'm like, oh yeah.

62
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:58,920
I showed him, he was freaking laughing at me.

63
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:05,920
I showed him the map where he watched the meccosal, we watched it together, we didn't watch Star Trek last night.

64
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:11,920
And he did what?

65
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:14,920
Oh excuse me, how are we on today?

66
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:16,920
Pardon me, boys.

67
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:23,920
I was like, I don't know if you just remember the snow map where you had to blow up the generator

68
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:27,920
and then all the friend Lee's turn hostile because you were actually hidden.

69
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:33,920
And I was trying to blow up the bridge and he was like, oh, that weapon's not going to do anything against that bridge.

70
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:36,920
And I'm like, how am I supposed to know that?

71
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:38,920
I'm going to make, it's giving me missiles.

72
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:45,920
Of course I'm going to use the freaking missiles and he's like laughing at my terrible freaking thingy.

73
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:50,920
And I was panicking and he was like, you know what, you actually are a wee bit entertaining.

74
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:53,920
I'm like, excuse you, I'm a bit entertaining.

75
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:59,920
Like give me some credit because he was like, oh that was actually kind of funny.

76
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:06,920
And I was like, yeah, so like if a dad calling you, literally call me a noob and I'm like, excuse you.

77
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:12,920
I was like, not even, I probably couldn't even speak when I first consumed the game.

78
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:16,920
Like, yeah, just to be that, right?

79
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:21,920
Because we were talking about content creators in general because I showed them more of the VTubers

80
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:23,920
and I showed them what the girls were doing, what I do.

81
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:29,920
And I said like, if you play a game that a refund really enjoys, like it's more entertaining.

82
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:34,920
Like it has so much more factor because if I had to watch a streamer play Viva Punyatta

83
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:41,920
or play, you know, Hell Divers 2, well I have a nostalgic bonus when it comes to Viva Punyatta.

84
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:47,920
Shame my daughter is a noob. I am forsaken. Why am I forsaken?

85
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:52,920
But he wants to play the game so I think my PC is getting stolen after this stream.

86
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:56,920
But it was fantastic.

87
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:59,920
Yes, I do apologize to anyone who is looking forward to the ASMR.

88
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:04,920
This is where the bad announcements begin.

89
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:07,920
We hate you, strongy, bad announcements.

90
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:10,920
I cannot do ASMR for three weeks.

91
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:14,920
Nor can I do any type of membership stream for three weeks.

92
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:24,920
However, as always, I will make it up instantly when my me pops goes away way again.

93
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:28,920
So today's ASMR has been swapped out.

94
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:31,920
But yes, there will be no ASMR plans for three weeks, there will be no thingy.

95
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:35,920
However, my gen mates are always doing ASMR.

96
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:42,920
Mercy did a fantastic ASMR stream yesterday called You Are My Pet POV.

97
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:46,920
Anarch, you're so stinky.

98
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:49,920
Boo. Thank you for the tip, Anarch.

99
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:54,920
Literally, this is the boooove ones. You suck, strong, boo.

100
00:09:54,920 --> 00:10:00,920
Okay, for the updates on everyone's Patreon, today everyone's Patreon will have at least one audio out.

101
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:06,920
There is a bit of a...

102
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:11,920
Try to phrase it nicely so it doesn't sound like an arsehole, but I do want to explain the situation.

103
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:18,920
There is a bit of a traffic jam, if you will, in production because some talents got a bit distracted

104
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:21,920
and forgot they had to record on top of streaming.

105
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:24,920
And it caused a bit of a traffic jam.

106
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:31,920
So today, by the end of today, this stream, I will be editing for myself in Azura.

107
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:35,920
There should be a Mercy and a AC.

108
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:40,920
And Shibi and Emi should already have uploads because they are done.

109
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:42,920
Okay, I have it.

110
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:48,920
Literally, the girls got a wee bit carried away and I was like, hey guys, remember that time we did Patreon

111
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:50,920
and it's like your main source of income.

112
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:53,920
Please, please, it takes 15 minutes.

113
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:55,920
15 minutes, please record.

114
00:10:55,920 --> 00:11:01,920
So it's a bit of a traffic jam, but it should be resolved by the end of this week.

115
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:02,920
So, yeah.

116
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:03,920
Understandable games are...

117
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:06,920
Yes, thank you for no one being annoyed at them.

118
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:12,920
But yes, at the end of the day, I will ensure that there is an audio for everyone at least one up.

119
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:15,920
And level up.

120
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:16,920
Okay.

121
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:20,920
And then take 15 minutes forever later.

122
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:22,920
Ah.

123
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:24,920
I love them.

124
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:26,920
I'm like, girls, please.

125
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:32,920
Now, they're still in my batch of scripts and I know my batch of scripts takes 15 minutes to record and you know more.

126
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:35,920
And I'm like, come on, baby girls, come on.

127
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:37,920
I'm like rubbing the lamp.

128
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:40,920
I'm like, come on, genie, you come, you come.

129
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:43,920
I'm like begging them, please, please, I want my knees.

130
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:44,920
But yes.

131
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:46,920
Thank you for your patience.

132
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:47,920
Apologies for the wait.

133
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:53,920
But again, after today, at least one will be up and then it will smooth out and be like,

134
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:56,920
there's two out by the 14.

135
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:57,920
Roughly.

136
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:00,920
I can't remember what everyone's upload date is, to be honest.

137
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:01,920
It's all over the shop.

138
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:07,920
But next month, I plan on having dates along with their schedules.

139
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:10,920
You know how they posted that funny haha schedule?

140
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:12,920
That...

141
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:15,920
Oh, it's not an ASMR stream.

142
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:16,920
My apologies.

143
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:18,920
No, I can't do ASMR for three weeks.

144
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:20,920
My gen mates at any point are doing ASMR.

145
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:26,920
Emmy is doing ASMR this week when she returns.

146
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:29,920
She's actually done a membership script writing.

147
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:32,920
We lurking to be like, hmm, is this how you write scripts?

148
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:34,920
I mean, this is how I write scripts.

149
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:36,920
I mean, it's just pure paper.

150
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:37,920
Pure paper.

151
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:38,920
Okay, I'm a...

152
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:39,920
You can always rub my lamp instead.

153
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:41,920
Go over here.

154
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:43,920
I'm going to slurp my tea, okay?

155
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:45,920
And then we'll get into a cane.

156
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:48,920
So you can actually see cane stats to the left.

157
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:51,920
He has 1.3 movement speed, which is fantastic.

158
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:53,920
And his damage is a bit harder.

159
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:55,920
That 4.2 damage.

160
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:56,920
Not bad, believe it.

161
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:58,920
And he has 1% luck.

162
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:03,920
So luck doesn't affect things like the Gambo machines.

163
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:06,920
What it affects is drop rate.

164
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:10,920
So we have an item, that little foot you see on my stuff.

165
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:12,920
We have a little item called Lucky Foot,

166
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:16,920
which means one, our luck is added by one.

167
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:19,920
And two, it means we can huff pills,

168
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:21,920
and they will be positive.

169
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:25,920
Now, there is a few pills that are positive in quotation marks

170
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:26,920
that aren't really.

171
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:29,920
An example of that is One Makes You Vigor.

172
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:32,920
It increases your hitbox, but it's considered a good pill.

173
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:36,920
But it means you can't lose stats via pills, basically.

174
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:41,920
Hi, Strawny.

175
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:43,920
With her father-in-law, I'm guessing there won't be a new

176
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:44,920
Patreon recording session.

177
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:48,920
I've already recorded my three audios.

178
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:52,920
I need to edit the script for the fourth that we wrote together.

179
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:55,920
And then, that's all for this month.

180
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:57,920
So don't worry, my Patreon.

181
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:59,920
I'm a smart bean.

182
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:01,920
I did a few things in advance,

183
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:04,920
because I knew how much of a numpty I was going to be, okay?

184
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:07,920
It also affects some item ability proc rates.

185
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:08,920
Yes, that too.

186
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:10,920
That is a very big note.

187
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:12,920
If you see in the bottom left,

188
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:14,920
it looks like I have a little paper clip in the corner.

189
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:17,920
I can open gold chests for free.

190
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:19,920
I do not require a key.

191
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:22,920
Three One Makes You Vigor should give you a transformation, though.

192
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:23,920
Yeah.

193
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:27,920
It's just that amazing.

194
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:31,920
Yeah, I knew I had to spam ahead, if you will.

195
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:33,920
Right, I'm slurping my tea.

196
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:37,920
The tea has been slurped.

197
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:41,920
Wow, Cain was built for a looting.

198
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:44,920
Yeah, so we're not playing Tainted Cain.

199
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:48,920
Tainted Cain has this thing called Loot Bag,

200
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:51,920
where you can take eight items.

201
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:53,920
Isaac's still a bit loud.

202
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:56,920
Goddamn, Isaac, calm down.

203
00:14:56,920 --> 00:14:58,920
I was really, actually,

204
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:00,920
that was one thing about the Microsoft stream.

205
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:02,920
My dad was like, wait, you didn't test the audio.

206
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:05,920
And I'm like, fucking stop annihilating me.

207
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:08,920
Oh my gosh, not all streamers are perfect.

208
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:11,920
I was getting absolutely roasted by my dad on my stream,

209
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:14,920
and I'm like, I've already told him how much I made in my first month.

210
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:17,920
I'm going to let it be a surprise when the short comes out

211
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:19,920
how much I made in my first month,

212
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:21,920
but I was like, I'm fucking annihilated.

213
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:22,920
I'm like, back off.

214
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:23,920
Get off me.

215
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:24,920
What's up?

216
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:25,920
Hi, Stranny.

217
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:26,920
Hi, everyone.

218
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:27,920
Are you excited?

219
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:28,920
Immers is coming back.

220
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:30,920
Your dad's a pro stream critic.

221
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:32,920
You're perfect roasted by dad.

222
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:33,920
Everything is shining.

223
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:36,920
Did he get shocked when the helicopter scene showed the audio peak?

224
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:37,920
Well, he was...

225
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:39,920
So we were at the waterfall,

226
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:41,920
and he was reading chat.

227
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:42,920
He was reading you guys,

228
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:45,920
and he was like, oh, they're really nice to you.

229
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:47,920
Because you play so badly.

230
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:50,920
I was like, all right, dad.

231
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:52,920
Fuck's sake, man.

232
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:54,920
But I was like, yeah.

233
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:56,920
So that's what chat is considered about.

234
00:15:56,920 --> 00:15:57,920
I was like saying that.

235
00:15:57,920 --> 00:15:59,920
I got asked reflins, but people say chat.

236
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:00,920
And he's lurking.

237
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:02,920
Literally, he was reading you.

238
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:04,920
And he was like, oh, everyone's so nice to you.

239
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:06,920
And I'm like, yeah.

240
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:09,920
And he was like...

241
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:11,920
So obviously, I was telling the stories about, like,

242
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:14,920
my dad used to play multiplayer in the water on Atlas.

243
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:16,920
And he was like, oh, you remember, you remember.

244
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:20,920
And I'm like, yeah, dad, you never stop talking to me about it.

245
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:22,920
Every time I bring up, like, Xbox.

246
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:26,920
Was he expecting us to treat you like an enemy on Xbox Live?

247
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:28,920
Oh, well, I was talking about, like,

248
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:31,920
how Xbox used to have open mic in those games.

249
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:33,920
And I was like, oh, people would play music.

250
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:35,920
They'd spam the N word down the mic.

251
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:36,920
All of that.

252
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:38,920
And he was like, oh, that's right.

253
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:39,920
That's right.

254
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:40,920
Yeah, yeah.

255
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:41,920
And I'm like, yep.

256
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:43,920
That's because it happened in Call of Duty when I played.

257
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:49,920
Well, is there a chance Papa Kottos is lurking?

258
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:50,920
Well, he's not reading.

259
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:51,920
Right now he's asleep.

260
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:53,920
I can hear the walls vibrate, which vibrate.

261
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:58,920
Vibrate of vibration, which is why we can't do it anymore.

262
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:01,920
But there is a chance he might watch this and be like,

263
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:02,920
what did you do today?

264
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:04,920
Because he finds it fascinating.

265
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:06,920
He's like, how did you earn that much money?

266
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:09,920
And I was like, oh, like, I believe in consistency.

267
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:12,920
I believe in an exchange of goods and services.

268
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:17,920
I was like explaining, like, we are being observed.

269
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:18,920
Yes.

270
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:22,920
I was explaining to him, like, the way I like to say thank you

271
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:25,920
is I like to provide more content.

272
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:31,920
So I have a disclaimer in my short that says how much I earned.

273
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:34,920
Basically, it's over 10K.

274
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:37,920
Because you guys are stupendously supportive.

275
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:40,920
But yeah, in my first month of strong calls,

276
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:43,920
I made over $10,000.

277
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:46,920
Because you guys are fucking insane.

278
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:49,920
I also break down the income via Patreon, stream elements,

279
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:52,920
and what I earned on YouTube.

280
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:54,920
Nothing you don't deserve.

281
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:56,920
I find it hard to accept.

282
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:58,920
I'm going to be honest.

283
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:00,920
That is a...

284
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:03,920
You know how, like, people were like, oh,

285
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:05,920
we need to support her more.

286
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:07,920
You give me more than enough.

287
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:09,920
We're funding Gen2.

288
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:13,920
Look, my Donathon is an October 10th.

289
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:17,920
At this rate, the Donathon end of goal is going to be like

290
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:21,920
$5,000 Gen2 production confirmed at this rate.

291
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:23,920
I'm going to be honest.

292
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:25,920
You will accept her money and you're going to like it.

293
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:29,920
Well, at least let me fucking get some ASMR in exchange.

294
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:32,920
And you were worried about funding Gen2.

295
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:34,920
Literally, I'm not being funny.

296
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:38,920
Originally, my Gen2 goal was going to be like

297
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:41,920
I think $15,000 US was my end goal.

298
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:43,920
And I would have things all the way.

299
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:47,920
And at the end, it would be like Gen2 confirmed production.

300
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:51,920
Motherfucker, I'm going to do it with like $300 at this rate.

301
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:53,920
VTuber community support.

302
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:55,920
It's actually insane.

303
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:58,920
It's genuinely insane.

304
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:00,920
Some had a year of build up.

305
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:02,920
I couldn't hold it.

306
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:06,920
This is terrible.

307
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:09,920
She said she was supported enough time to support her.

308
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:11,920
No, seriously.

309
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:14,920
So I broke down the income, but I had to see a few disclaimers.

310
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:17,920
My disclaimers, like, I stream every single day.

311
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:20,920
I can't remember my other ones.

312
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:21,920
But I did have disclaimers.

313
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:23,920
And then at the end, I was like,

314
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:26,920
I remember to hold 30% for tax purposes.

315
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:29,920
Like, I sounded so depressed at the end.

316
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:30,920
You deserve it.

317
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:33,920
You're basically a comfort streamer for all good.

318
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:35,920
Even with my wee accent.

319
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:37,920
Yeah, am I your comfort streamer putting you to sleep?

320
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:41,920
My only gripe is having to pay 5 or 10% of that taxes to the company.

321
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:44,920
You beat 10% taxes.

322
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:47,920
What country do you live in, Luxembourg?

323
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:49,920
10%?

324
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:51,920
10%?

325
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:53,920
What the fuck?

326
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:55,920
I'm, like, 30%.

327
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:57,920
Hmm.

328
00:19:57,920 --> 00:19:59,920
Accent's part of why I come back every day.

329
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:01,920
You're like that.

330
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:02,920
You're like that.

331
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:05,920
And then, see, that accent is getting you 10K.

332
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:07,920
I don't think that I'm not being funny.

333
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:10,920
My Donaldson goal is not going to be 10K at this rate.

334
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:12,920
Like, the end goal, you know how it's like,

335
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:14,920
oh, my goal has been achieved.

336
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:16,920
Right, here's extended.

337
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:18,920
No.

338
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:24,920
I have put in a plushy request for a certain MILF goddess.

339
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:26,920
Goddess of fertility.

340
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:28,920
Pardon my French, not MILF.

341
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:32,920
I have put in a request about a plushy for a bleeding heart.

342
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:34,920
So I'm going to see what the response is.

343
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:38,920
And depending on that, we either do a different business

344
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:41,920
or see what happens, I don't know.

345
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:46,920
But I am starting to mildly prepare for Azur's donathon.

346
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:50,920
Her birthday donathon starts and immediately ends.

347
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:52,920
I'm not being funny, but I'm starting to think

348
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:54,920
that's what's going to happen.

349
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:55,920
I don't want to predict the future,

350
00:20:55,920 --> 00:21:00,920
but I'm getting nervous for how little the actual end goal is.

351
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:03,920
It's going to be, like, Gen 2 production confirmed.

352
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:04,920
$69.

353
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:05,920
There you go.

354
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:06,920
When is Azur's birthday?

355
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:08,920
The 21st of August.

356
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:10,920
Now, I know I'm being a bit pre-emptive,

357
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:12,920
but a month and a week and two weeks and a...

358
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:15,920
Just change the goal at Gen 3 while you're at it.

359
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:17,920
Honestly, at this rate.

360
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:20,920
Hmm.

361
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:22,920
Just add more goals then.

362
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:24,920
Thankfully, I do have very good stretch goals,

363
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:27,920
which I think everyone's going to be quite happy with.

364
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:30,920
I am focusing on more public access things.

365
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:33,920
Maybe, you know, free.

366
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:36,920
Actually, that reminds me, I need to edit so much for Twitter.

367
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:38,920
I'll turn it off.

368
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:41,920
And...

369
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:44,920
And I've got a Bible movement inside me.

370
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:46,920
Stretch goals.

371
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:48,920
Quite literally.

372
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:51,920
Yeah.

373
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:53,920
The rest goes to the shareholders.

374
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:56,920
Hmm, yes, we have shareholders.

375
00:21:56,920 --> 00:22:00,920
Anyway, done with the high table while we're at it.

376
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:03,920
Okay, I have hydration.

377
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:05,920
Hmm.

378
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:09,920
The community posts in the community-related videos are quite good, yes.

379
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:11,920
It's my first one doing it.

380
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:14,920
I was like, I want to do a 60-minute, like, triggers.

381
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:18,920
So I'm going to take screenshots of the ones that I want to see.

382
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:20,920
Now, I don't want anyone being...

383
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:23,920
Having a sorbuti, because I've no peggio for one.

384
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:27,920
But then you have a sorbuti if I didn't pick the phrase or thing you've asked me.

385
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:32,920
It's not like it's the only one I'm going to be doing, okay?

386
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:34,920
Hello, America Hiya!

387
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:36,920
You're my goal and I want to straight...

388
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:38,920
That's terrible.

389
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:41,920
She says one of her goals is literally a figurine.

390
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:43,920
That's a tentacle.

391
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:45,920
Can we be a bit mean with the phrases?

392
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:47,920
Yes, most certainly.

393
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:49,920
I have absolutely no issues with that.

394
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:51,920
Okay, so we are lovely cane.

395
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:53,920
No, we're not going to do boss rush.

396
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:55,920
I'm just going to talk through it.

397
00:22:55,920 --> 00:23:01,920
So you can actually see we have a lucky foot pixel on our right foot.

398
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:04,920
See how it's like a bit red?

399
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:07,920
We've got a sacrifice room, which no, we are not messing with.

400
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:11,920
But there is a chance the fires can drop a cheeky coin for us.

401
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:14,920
Cane is smooth like butter.

402
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:17,920
We did pick about one a wee coin.

403
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:19,920
You also have the best drink ever.

404
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:21,920
Good smile collab when steady on.

405
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:23,920
I think we need a wee bit more numbers now.

406
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:26,920
I'm not much of a number whole bag,

407
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:30,920
but I have to admit when it comes to contacting companies like that,

408
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:32,920
I kind of need the...

409
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:34,920
Oh God, these blow up.

410
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:36,920
Oh no.

411
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:40,920
Okay, I am not good at Isaac.

412
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:42,920
So if I could just get Godhead, that would be...

413
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:44,920
I don't even think I've unlocked Godhead.

414
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:47,920
You know, there's so many items I've yet to unlock.

415
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:52,920
But yes, we're just having a chill day on Isaac.

416
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:54,920
I get to nerd about it because I love it.

417
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:56,920
And I can't wait to play multiplayer Isaac with you.

418
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:58,920
See these spiders?

419
00:23:58,920 --> 00:23:59,920
See you.

420
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:00,920
One shot, yeah.

421
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:02,920
Oh, and it unlocks a new spider.

422
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:04,920
Just to really upset me, yeah.

423
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:08,920
I am taking damage in unclear room,

424
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:10,920
grants flight,

425
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:12,920
spectral tears,

426
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:15,920
stops time greatly increases speed and fire rate.

427
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:18,920
I mean, we have to take damage to activate it,

428
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:22,920
but I mean, it's better than nothing.

429
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:25,920
Okay, we'll grab this.

430
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:27,920
Godhead.

431
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:29,920
Cast the gate that enemies with the Godhead.

432
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:31,920
I keep forgetting you can slowly move if you're on a controller.

433
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:33,920
Oh yeah, I'm a controller.

434
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:34,920
I'm not moving.

435
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:35,920
Oh, you didn't see that.

436
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:36,920
No, that's it.

437
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:40,920
Wait, why is it so small?

438
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:42,920
Why can't I make it bigger?

439
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:44,920
No, I feel like manual...

440
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:45,920
Oh my God.

441
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:46,920
No, don't.

442
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:47,920
This is embarrassing.

443
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:48,920
I like...

444
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:49,920
Stop.

445
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:51,920
I like accidentally minimized it.

446
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:52,920
It won't let it go big.

447
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:53,920
Stop.

448
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:54,920
That's so embarrassing.

449
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:57,920
It won't let it go big again.

450
00:24:57,920 --> 00:24:58,920
Get big.

451
00:24:58,920 --> 00:25:00,920
What are you doing?

452
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:01,920
Oh my God.

453
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:02,920
Right.

454
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:03,920
Hold on.

455
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:05,920
That's actually so embarrassing.

456
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:07,920
Okay, that's the best I can do.

457
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:09,920
I don't know how I managed that,

458
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:11,920
but what's done is done.

459
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:14,920
Press F.

460
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:16,920
Alt return to full...

461
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:17,920
Alt return.

462
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:18,920
Stop.

463
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:19,920
I'll actually believe you.

464
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:20,920
But the heck is return?

465
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:22,920
Return isn't a button on the keyboard.

466
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:24,920
Oh my God, it is F.

467
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:26,920
The reeflings told the truth.

468
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:27,920
The reeflings loved me.

469
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:29,920
They didn't tell me to Alt F4.

470
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:31,920
Hold on.

471
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:33,920
Yay.

472
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:34,920
Thank you, reefling.

473
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:37,920
Who said Alt?

474
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:38,920
Alt owner.

475
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:39,920
Look at you.

476
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:40,920
I actually being nice to you.

477
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:41,920
What the heck?

478
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:43,920
See, other streamer communities

479
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:44,920
would have trolled the fuck.

480
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:46,920
I'm like, uh, uh, uh, actually panicking.

481
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:49,920
Oh, I don't like those guys.

482
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:53,920
I don't like burning basement.

483
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:55,920
Actually, well, I'm at it.

484
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:57,920
I don't like any enemies in Isaac

485
00:25:57,920 --> 00:25:59,920
because they're all meanie-boo beanies.

486
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:02,920
Please don't jump into the fire.

487
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:04,920
Because when he jump into the fire,

488
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:06,920
he gets higher and higher.

489
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:11,920
Can we get much higher and higher?

490
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:13,920
Stay.

491
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:14,920
No, we don't need that.

492
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:16,920
What we got?

493
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:17,920
We got useless.

494
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:20,920
We don't even have enough for it.

495
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:22,920
And it's an unidentified film.

496
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:26,920
Not even Larry Junior?

497
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:28,920
I don't know.

498
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:29,920
I hate this, the sailors,

499
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:30,920
because it fills spiders.

500
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:33,920
Otherwise, other ways for sure.

501
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:34,920
But I like that.

502
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:35,920
What do you mean?

503
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:36,920
We never billy or troll you forever.

504
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:38,920
Okay, this isn't actually the worst jewel.

505
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:41,920
I'm kind of wanting to get rid of the baby guy first

506
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:43,920
because he's a bit of a headache.

507
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:45,920
Oh, it's not going to happen.

508
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:47,920
It's not going to happen.

509
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:48,920
It's fine.

510
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:50,920
Watch me get...

511
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:57,920
Yeah, unfortunately, when he gets untethered,

512
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:59,920
he has quite interesting physics,

513
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:02,920
which I don't like going off against.

514
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:06,920
I don't know, maybe we can just do that.

515
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:08,920
Are you joking me?

516
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:10,920
The one thing I didn't want was to go against him.

517
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:11,920
Empty heart.

518
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:14,920
Taking damage as a chance to spawn a red heart.

519
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:18,920
Okay, hold on.

520
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:22,920
Now, we could maybe get insanely...

521
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:24,920
Oh my god, it's a wake-up.

522
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:28,920
We could maybe get insanely,

523
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:34,920
insanely lucky on these sacrificial spikes.

524
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:40,920
Due to old vantage, has a chance to spawn hearts.

525
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:41,920
Okay.

526
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:44,920
Okay, hold on.

527
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:46,920
And then we have two hearts back here.

528
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:48,920
So you'll notice we pee now at the door.

529
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:50,920
When your health is hidden,

530
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:52,920
that will tell you if you're in trouble or not.

531
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:54,920
So we're peeing because we have a half a heart.

532
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:56,920
So we're going to pick up these double hearts here.

533
00:27:56,920 --> 00:27:58,920
Yummy, yummy, juicy, juicy.

534
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:00,920
What?

535
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:05,920
Aww.

536
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:08,920
Why does the message only say faces on screen?

537
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:09,920
I'll make you change that.

538
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:12,920
Thank you very much to me, Tim Schottel.

539
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:14,920
Thank you.

540
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:16,920
For your kind tip.

541
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:17,920
I appreciate it.

542
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:19,920
Does that actually mean...

543
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:20,920
We got a sack?

544
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:21,920
Oh my gosh.

545
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:23,920
Wait, that was actually a really good story.

546
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:25,920
Oh, and we got a heart back.

547
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:29,920
Come on, surely we'll get an S tier item.

548
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:30,920
Literally S tier.

549
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:32,920
And we got a heart back.

550
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:36,920
Oh my god, we're actually doing so good.

551
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:42,920
What do I need to do?

552
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:45,920
Do I need to sacrifice that wee guy?

553
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:46,920
I think so.

554
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:50,920
I think I'm going to have to sacrifice that heart.

555
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:51,920
You know that?

556
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:55,920
Okay, we're not...

557
00:28:57,920 --> 00:28:59,920
Oh no, it's behind this.

558
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:01,920
Oh, I wouldn't have done that had I known.

559
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:04,920
And seeing Gamble luck, I thought it was going to drop.

560
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:06,920
I just realized we can probably just...

561
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:07,920
die in this room.

562
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:11,920
If one of the bombs ricochet...

563
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:13,920
Oh god, get me out, get me out, right.

564
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:14,920
Safe, safe, safe.

565
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:16,920
Right, what's the card?

566
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:18,920
Teleports Isaac to the shop, sure.

567
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:19,920
Okay, we are going to...

568
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:21,920
Oh no, we don't have enough health.

569
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:24,920
Oh, I shouldn't have picked that up.

570
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:26,920
I could have bought one from the shop.

571
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:27,920
You know that?

572
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:29,920
What have I done?

573
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:31,920
What have I done?

574
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:33,920
You have to kill me.

575
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:34,920
I'm going to kill you.

576
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:35,920
What have I done?

577
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:36,920
You have to kill an angel.

578
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:37,920
No, you can actually...

579
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:39,920
There's not a heart in the shop.

580
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:41,920
Are you serious?

581
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:47,920
If we do not get Gibbon...

582
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:50,920
a heart when we stand on the spike,

583
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:53,920
I don't think we can pick up our reward.

584
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:56,920
We need a heart to draw.

585
00:29:57,920 --> 00:29:58,920
I literally...

586
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:00,920
Alright, bye.

587
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:05,920
Are you serious?

588
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:06,920
We need...

589
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:08,920
We need a smithereen of a heart.

590
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:10,920
We're going to have to actually buy that card in the shop

591
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:12,920
and hope it's the lover's card,

592
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:14,920
which gives us two red hearts.

593
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:22,920
I have been trolled.

594
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:25,920
I have been trolled.

595
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:28,920
The super secret room, maybe.

596
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:36,920
I mean, we'll pop it.

597
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:38,920
Oh, I knew the secret room was there.

598
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:40,920
Alright, hold on.

599
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:42,920
I'm doing it from this side, though.

600
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:45,920
Please have something in it for me.

601
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:48,920
No.

602
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:52,920
It's just money.

603
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:55,920
So where's the other room?

604
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:57,920
Is it down here?

605
00:30:57,920 --> 00:31:00,920
I thought it might be here or there.

606
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:04,920
I don't like this map play out.

607
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:06,920
I hate when the maps...

608
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:08,920
I mean, it could be an elbow.

609
00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:09,920
Which is here.

610
00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:11,920
We'll only have one bomb left.

611
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:13,920
Buy the pill.

612
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:15,920
Maybe it's a full health.

613
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:23,920
I can't believe we did all the sacrificing for nothing.

614
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:25,920
Come on, pill.

615
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:28,920
Tears up.

616
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:29,920
I mean...

617
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:30,920
It's alright.

618
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:34,920
Oh, that's so unlucky.

619
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:37,920
What shop doesn't have a freaking heart?

620
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:39,920
And there's no heart that dropped here.

621
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:44,920
There could be something behind here.

622
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:45,920
Money.

623
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:48,920
Not what we wanted.

624
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:52,920
Super secret room isn't next to any other room.

625
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:54,920
Yeah, it can be, can't it?

626
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:55,920
Gamble over.

627
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:56,920
I believe in the sack luck.

628
00:31:56,920 --> 00:31:59,920
There'll be nothing inside that we can utilize.

629
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:02,920
Yeah, a bomb and a key.

630
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:06,920
That is so unlucky.

631
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:09,920
Wait, is that actual?

632
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:12,920
Not me learning that Super Secret Room only has one connected to it.

633
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:14,920
Well, then it can't be elbow.

634
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:16,920
It has to be like one of these weird ones here.

635
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:19,920
My guess is opposite of the shop.

636
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:20,920
We're doing it once.

637
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:22,920
I don't want to waste my bombs.

638
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:24,920
Well, I've wasted my bomb.

639
00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:28,920
I can't believe that.

640
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:30,920
We were one away from greatness.

641
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:31,920
Oh well.

642
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:32,920
We tried, we tried.

643
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:35,920
We can maybe do a bit better on the next floor, okay?

644
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:37,920
Womp, womp, womp.

645
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:38,920
Terrible luck.

646
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:43,920
I should feel ashamed of myself for how terrible that luck was.

647
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:48,920
Shops, treasure rooms and boss rooms don't count as rooms.

648
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:49,920
Great grandpa.

649
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:52,920
Okay, we're just going to pop the hermit then now.

650
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:56,920
Because normally we do get spawned in.

651
00:32:56,920 --> 00:32:59,920
God, what a trinket now.

652
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:03,920
Again, there's no healing in here.

653
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:06,920
The game where it's like, oh god, I really need to not mess up

654
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:08,920
or this is going to lose my run.

655
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:14,920
Okay.

656
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:16,920
Got a bomb back from him.

657
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:21,920
Okay, hopefully there's something good in this suite.

658
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:24,920
Oh, there is a chest here we can get into for free.

659
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:27,920
We just need to sacrifice a bomb for it.

660
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:30,920
I know, I know you're like, oh, strong eight,

661
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:32,920
where did you get these MLG skills?

662
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:34,920
I know, I'm just so good at Isaac.

663
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:35,920
What do you mean I get super lucky?

664
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:38,920
And the only reason I win runs is because I get like,

665
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:40,920
I love Spoonbender.

666
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:42,920
It's my favorite item.

667
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:44,920
Because you don't have to aim.

668
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:46,920
I love Spoonbender.

669
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:48,920
We got a cheeky heart.

670
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:50,920
Let's see what's in here.

671
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:52,920
Slows down enemies, deals 10 damage.

672
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:54,920
I mean, it's a fill room damage.

673
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:56,920
We don't even have an active item.

674
00:33:56,920 --> 00:33:58,920
Right, we're going to pop this.

675
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:01,920
Is there a tenant rock?

676
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:09,920
Hey mom, hi broly legend.

677
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:11,920
We've got started.

678
00:34:11,920 --> 00:34:13,920
We're doing...

679
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:15,920
I was actually lucky.

680
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:17,920
Okay, now we have tons of keys.

681
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:18,920
Just like that.

682
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:20,920
We are playing...

683
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:22,920
Isaac Kane,

684
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:24,920
and we can huff pills on Kane.

685
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:26,920
We love Casting Spills.

686
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:28,920
I hate...

687
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:30,920
I hate when the enemies do that.

688
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:32,920
Sorry.

689
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:34,920
Someone's getting the boot.

690
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:38,920
We got two pills though.

691
00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:40,920
Luck.

692
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:42,920
Experimental HP up.

693
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:44,920
See, where were you when we needed you most?

694
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:45,920
Hmm?

695
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:47,920
Could have used my ultimate.

696
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:50,920
Spoon, Bender and Brimstone.

697
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:52,920
Oh yeah, that's exactly what I like.

698
00:34:52,920 --> 00:34:54,920
Thank you broly legend for the fine.

699
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:57,920
You missed it, but I was talking about

700
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:00,920
how supportive the reeflings are

701
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:02,920
and how my...

702
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:04,920
God, it's because my luck is so high.

703
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:07,920
Now we have an increased rate for chest drops,

704
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:09,920
which gives multiple items.

705
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:11,920
I don't know if I want to go in there yet.

706
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:13,920
What, we got 100% Devil Deal?

707
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:16,920
I don't know if we're doing Devil Deal.

708
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:18,920
Phew, you cheeky cheekerton.

709
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:22,920
I prefer the Angel Deal

710
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:24,920
because you don't have to sacrifice anyhow.

711
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:26,920
Ooh.

712
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:28,920
Devil's Isaac's Coins.

713
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:31,920
Ooh, okay, okay, okay.

714
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:34,920
What was in the shop again? Was it anything of value?

715
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:36,920
No.

716
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:40,920
One luck, double it in that.

717
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:43,920
Shops aren't being very kind to me today.

718
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:45,920
Brim is the Devil item though.

719
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:47,920
No, but...

720
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:49,920
What happens if I got Sacred Heart though?

721
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:51,920
Smile.

722
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:53,920
Oh come on, don't...

723
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:55,920
I hate these guys when they hide behind rocks.

724
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:57,920
You know what you're doing, eh?

725
00:35:57,920 --> 00:35:59,920
Yeah, exactly, as soon as I get closer to it.

726
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:00,920
What does it do?

727
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:02,920
Freaking jumps closer to the screen.

728
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:03,920
That's right.

729
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:04,920
That's right.

730
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:05,920
You're done for.

731
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:07,920
Get rekt, get rekt.

732
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:09,920
I knew it, I knew it.

733
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:11,920
Probably Isaac's.

734
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:13,920
Um...

735
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:16,920
Another hermit, surprisingly enough.

736
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:17,920
Sacred Heart is better.

737
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:18,920
Breath of life incoming.

738
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:20,920
Stop, if that's my first item.

739
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:23,920
Okay, it's fine, it's fine.

740
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:28,920
Uh...

741
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:29,920
Steady on.

742
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:31,920
Oh god, my analogue stick's kinda...

743
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:33,920
Gonna look funny.

744
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:36,920
Bomba, no tinted rock.

745
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:40,920
Get rid of that.

746
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:44,920
See what you're gonna draw behind you.

747
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:46,920
Okay, that's fine, it's fine, it's fine.

748
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:50,920
Right, so because there's nothing here,

749
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:52,920
it makes me think, oh no, I can't be here.

750
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:54,920
What the heck are the secret rooms in this map?

751
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:56,920
Down, straight down.

752
00:36:56,920 --> 00:36:58,920
Elbow maybe?

753
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:01,920
And then one here?

754
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:05,920
Yeah, okay.

755
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:07,920
We're gonna...

756
00:37:08,920 --> 00:37:11,920
Now you can get pills from...

757
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:17,920
From the mushrooms, so I think I am gonna

758
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:19,920
spend some bombs on these.

759
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:22,920
Yes, that's what we wanted.

760
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:25,920
I'm drowsy, no, oh no, I don't...

761
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:31,920
Ah, right, what a waste.

762
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:35,920
Draft, draft, double draft, but it's fine.

763
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:37,920
It's fine, you can't win them all, smile.

764
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:39,920
Hopefully we'll get a key beggar.

765
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:42,920
Slow down.

766
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:44,920
What? What kind of room is this?

767
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:46,920
Oh, hold on, let's pop this right now.

768
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:51,920
Yes, we definitely would like a slow down effect,

769
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:53,920
I say, as the or is already sped up.

770
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:56,920
You were like slow for a millisecond, please.

771
00:37:56,920 --> 00:38:00,920
I don't have the tears or benefit of any of this yet.

772
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:03,920
I literally have like super passive items.

773
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:06,920
The only reason we have a stat up is because of...

774
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:09,920
What's it called?

775
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:11,920
Because of...

776
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:14,920
Pills.

777
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:16,920
Because we have astral projection,

778
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:19,920
which it gets me a thing if I get damaged.

779
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:22,920
Lucky bandage is passive and so is lucky key.

780
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:25,920
Oh, please, just perish.

781
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:27,920
Actually, I will say one thing I like about the monster design.

782
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:30,920
If you look at this monster, he has a cleft palate,

783
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:33,920
which is when your little schnozer in your mouth connect.

784
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:36,920
You can get it fixed in surgery, it's not a big deal.

785
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:38,920
But I like that the designs are quite...

786
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:42,920
There's quite a few diagnoses that turned into bosses,

787
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:43,920
which I think is pretty cool.

788
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:44,920
I mean, I thought it was pretty cool.

789
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:46,920
Oh god, I'm so tempted to go inside.

790
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:49,920
Ruffer's floor, little monstero, yay.

791
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:51,920
But there is quite a few...

792
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:55,920
I'll take the diamond card with me so we can double our money.

793
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:57,920
I know I should have done the cursed room,

794
00:38:57,920 --> 00:38:59,920
but I had terrible luck last time.

795
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:04,920
I'd rather sacrifice my health on...

796
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:08,920
On a...

797
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:11,920
Oh, yeah, fuck him up, fuck him up, yeah.

798
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:13,920
Take that, take that.

799
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:19,920
All right, so I get to keep this.

800
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:21,920
I'm just losing all my health.

801
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:22,920
I'm just losing my health, I don't want it.

802
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:24,920
I didn't want my health anyway, I didn't need it.

803
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:27,920
I'm going to lose my angel deal because of this twat.

804
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:30,920
Oh, goodness' sake.

805
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:31,920
That was terrible.

806
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:33,920
Sorry, I really am just terrible at the game.

807
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:36,920
I'm just popping this right now because I don't trust myself.

808
00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:40,920
Yeah, that's...

809
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:43,920
I'm going to need the shops to help me out with something.

810
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:48,920
Give me, like, champions belt, damage up.

811
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:50,920
I'll take that.

812
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:52,920
Black candle...

813
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:54,920
Does that give me a damage up?

814
00:39:54,920 --> 00:39:57,920
Give me a damage up and avoid curses?

815
00:39:57,920 --> 00:39:58,920
I think so.

816
00:39:58,920 --> 00:39:59,920
Money!

817
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:00,920
Boss rush this time?

818
00:40:00,920 --> 00:40:01,920
No, you ain't getting it.

819
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:03,920
You excited for the next Ed McMuffin game?

820
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:05,920
It's called Mugenics.

821
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:07,920
I saw gameplay footage of it.

822
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:12,920
I'll be interested to see if it will...

823
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:14,920
Oh, I don't want to take the full heart yet.

824
00:40:14,920 --> 00:40:17,920
I'll stay half heart in case there's a sacrifice room.

825
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:19,920
Mugenics looks interesting.

826
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:23,920
I'm not sure how much I...

827
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:25,920
I'm going to enjoy it.

828
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:29,920
It is a perplexing game.

829
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:31,920
From the stuff that I've seen of it.

830
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:34,920
I don't know how the mushrooms work, I'm going to be honest.

831
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:38,920
I don't know if he's going to do a diagonal.

832
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:41,920
I do have time to react though, so I can get out of the way.

833
00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:44,920
I hope it's multiplayer.

834
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:46,920
Think big, find chaos in the shop.

835
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:47,920
Wild card.

836
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:49,920
A little bit cheeky chaos.

837
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:53,920
I'm going to play it safe.

838
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:54,920
This guy really...

839
00:40:54,920 --> 00:40:58,920
You shouldn't really be taking damage from him once you know what's up.

840
00:40:58,920 --> 00:41:02,920
I'm just playing mega safe because I lost all my hearts

841
00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:04,920
and I really want to get an angel deal.

842
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:10,920
He just perished him.

843
00:41:10,920 --> 00:41:12,920
He's like, I've had enough.

844
00:41:12,920 --> 00:41:13,920
A large bomb.

845
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:15,920
Well, we'll touch it anyway,

846
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:18,920
but I think it actually prefers slowing.

847
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:22,920
The large bomb would help with the enemy though.

848
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:26,920
I don't have flay and before it drops like a coin.

849
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:28,920
I don't have flay.

850
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:29,920
Give me...

851
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:32,920
Yeah, I was going to say counterfeit penny.

852
00:41:32,920 --> 00:41:33,920
I don't have flay.

853
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:35,920
Maybe I'll get flay in a sec.

854
00:41:38,920 --> 00:41:42,920
If I do actually win this smile.

855
00:41:42,920 --> 00:41:45,920
Right, I beg, give me something good.

856
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:50,920
You didn't see it,

857
00:41:50,920 --> 00:41:54,920
but I just violently put my head backwards out of annoyance.

858
00:42:02,920 --> 00:42:05,920
Well, this bomb in exchange of seven is worth it,

859
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:07,920
so we'll grab that.

860
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:09,920
Wait, use it to become flying.

861
00:42:10,920 --> 00:42:11,920
Refling?

862
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:14,920
Can I teleport you into my brain right now?

863
00:42:14,920 --> 00:42:15,920
Oh my God.

864
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:17,920
Why are you so smart?

865
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:18,920
Why?

866
00:42:20,920 --> 00:42:21,920
Okay.

867
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:24,920
The question is, do we take counterfeit penny or not?

868
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:27,920
Did we do it?

869
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:29,920
Did we go out on economy?

870
00:42:32,920 --> 00:42:33,920
Yes.

871
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:35,920
Because we have a good drop rate.

872
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:37,920
We're doing economy.

873
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:38,920
I should have picked that up first, idiot.

874
00:42:38,920 --> 00:42:39,920
Anyway.

875
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:41,920
Right, grab this first.

876
00:42:42,920 --> 00:42:43,920
And then we'll go back to this.

877
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:44,920
Refling, you're so smart.

878
00:42:44,920 --> 00:42:46,920
Right, we're going to pop our diamonds.

879
00:42:46,920 --> 00:42:48,920
So boom, we've got 48 coins just like that.

880
00:42:48,920 --> 00:42:50,920
We are going to pick up the cards

881
00:42:50,920 --> 00:42:52,920
because we might get a hierophant.

882
00:42:52,920 --> 00:42:53,920
Ooh.

883
00:42:55,920 --> 00:42:57,920
Ooh, we got the justies.

884
00:42:57,920 --> 00:42:59,920
Okay, we'll just go full health over that.

885
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:01,920
Spawn's a blood donation.

886
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:03,920
Teleports Isaac to the first floor,

887
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:06,920
and then we'll just do angel deal to get it.

888
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:11,920
We got holy man.

889
00:43:14,920 --> 00:43:15,920
Oh my Lord.

890
00:43:16,920 --> 00:43:19,920
I don't know if I can beat up this angel.

891
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:25,920
I don't think I have the strength to beat him up,

892
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:26,920
but we have holy man.

893
00:43:26,920 --> 00:43:29,920
Oh, we'll come back and beat up the angels at a later date.

894
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:31,920
What we got?

895
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:33,920
Blood donation machine.

896
00:43:34,920 --> 00:43:36,920
I'm going to see if there's a sacrifice one.

897
00:43:36,920 --> 00:43:38,920
It doesn't look like there is,

898
00:43:38,920 --> 00:43:42,920
but we might be able to get a sugar ton of money.

899
00:43:42,920 --> 00:43:43,920
Please don't do that.

900
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:44,920
Money.

901
00:43:46,920 --> 00:43:48,920
Please stop jumping around the map.

902
00:43:48,920 --> 00:43:49,920
You're scaring me.

903
00:43:52,920 --> 00:43:53,920
Wah.

904
00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:55,920
Now you can go into the curse room for free.

905
00:43:55,920 --> 00:43:57,920
You are so right bestie.

906
00:43:57,920 --> 00:44:00,920
So I never realized this stuff until you type it out.

907
00:44:00,920 --> 00:44:03,920
I'm sure there are tumors that can maximize.

908
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:06,920
Isaac runs down to every little detail.

909
00:44:06,920 --> 00:44:09,920
Me, I'm like, oh yeah, you can do that.

910
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:10,920
Can you?

911
00:44:10,920 --> 00:44:11,920
Yeah.

912
00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:12,920
Right.

913
00:44:12,920 --> 00:44:13,920
Let's go grab.

914
00:44:14,920 --> 00:44:17,920
I think we'll pop blood donation machine as well.

915
00:44:22,920 --> 00:44:25,920
This is why we don't do the curse room.

916
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:32,920
I'm kind of tempted, but I don't want to...

917
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:34,920
If we get back in the angel room,

918
00:44:34,920 --> 00:44:38,920
I'll take that as a sign that we are supposed to jump in.

919
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:41,920
We are not taking curse before.

920
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:44,920
And I was like, oh, why don't you take curse today?

921
00:44:44,920 --> 00:44:45,920
Do you need to take curse?

922
00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:46,920
No.

923
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:49,920
Okay, let's pop this one.

924
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:53,920
Two, three, four.

925
00:44:54,920 --> 00:44:58,920
And then grab that and then one, two.

926
00:45:00,920 --> 00:45:03,920
Oh, we did get a bandage prop.

927
00:45:03,920 --> 00:45:04,920
Oh, there we go.

928
00:45:04,920 --> 00:45:05,920
That's what we want.

929
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:06,920
We want the...

930
00:45:06,920 --> 00:45:09,920
We want the bandage train.

931
00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:12,920
Well, someone please think of the bandages.

932
00:45:12,920 --> 00:45:15,920
We might be able to get blood at IV bag.

933
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:18,920
If we get IV bag, we're in the money

934
00:45:18,920 --> 00:45:21,920
because IV puts off our speed.

935
00:45:23,920 --> 00:45:25,920
Here we go for it, I think so.

936
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:26,920
Oh, there you go.

937
00:45:28,920 --> 00:45:31,920
I think we're going to go and roll for IV bag

938
00:45:32,920 --> 00:45:36,920
because it puts our speed up and gives us another health slot.

939
00:45:36,920 --> 00:45:37,920
What did you call me?

940
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:38,920
Yeah, that's right.

941
00:45:38,920 --> 00:45:39,920
I called you that.

942
00:45:40,920 --> 00:45:43,920
We're also going to put money in the donation machine in general

943
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:46,920
because that will raise our floor luck.

944
00:45:47,920 --> 00:45:48,920
Okay, I stick.

945
00:45:48,920 --> 00:45:49,920
There we go.

946
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:50,920
Yeah, you better start proking.

947
00:45:50,920 --> 00:45:53,920
Shawnee breaking the economy feels good, man.

948
00:45:54,920 --> 00:45:56,920
I became the very thing I swore to destroy.

949
00:45:56,920 --> 00:46:00,920
Oh, come on, pop.

950
00:46:02,920 --> 00:46:04,920
Oh, no, no, this can't be.

951
00:46:04,920 --> 00:46:06,920
Right, we're going to grab this health.

952
00:46:06,920 --> 00:46:07,920
We're at 84 economy.

953
00:46:07,920 --> 00:46:08,920
Don't mind if I do.

954
00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:10,920
Shawnee, this is a lot.

955
00:46:12,920 --> 00:46:13,920
Weezer build?

956
00:46:13,920 --> 00:46:15,920
Are you making fun of my build?

957
00:46:16,920 --> 00:46:18,920
Getting billy though.

958
00:46:18,920 --> 00:46:22,920
Right, we don't have anything else we can really utilize.

959
00:46:22,920 --> 00:46:23,920
Tell for Isaac.

960
00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:25,920
Right, first things first.

961
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:26,920
We'll just double the bombs now.

962
00:46:26,920 --> 00:46:27,920
Get out of the way.

963
00:46:27,920 --> 00:46:29,920
Bunk and then do that.

964
00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:33,920
And then buy you the world.

965
00:46:35,920 --> 00:46:37,920
It's probably better using on the next floor.

966
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:41,920
We're going to put away some money so we can increase our luck

967
00:46:41,920 --> 00:46:44,920
and angel deal per chance.

968
00:46:46,920 --> 00:46:48,920
Or we'll just jam it and get nothing.

969
00:46:50,920 --> 00:46:52,920
Not like I wanted anything anyway.

970
00:46:53,920 --> 00:46:56,920
Right, four.

971
00:46:56,920 --> 00:46:57,920
What do we need?

972
00:46:57,920 --> 00:46:58,920
We've got eight key.

973
00:46:58,920 --> 00:46:59,920
I mean, we have plenty.

974
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:02,920
We'll keep the world for next.

975
00:47:02,920 --> 00:47:04,920
You already have Nightmare Penny in the shop.

976
00:47:04,920 --> 00:47:05,920
Yes, I've done that before already.

977
00:47:05,920 --> 00:47:07,920
And then I blew it up.

978
00:47:08,920 --> 00:47:13,920
We'll just bomb this because we can't donate into it anymore,

979
00:47:13,920 --> 00:47:15,920
but we can get the monies out of it.

980
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:20,920
Now, our great chance fight for the shop does go up exponentially.

981
00:47:23,920 --> 00:47:24,920
Okay, wait.

982
00:47:24,920 --> 00:47:25,920
So what is here?

983
00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:28,920
Okay.

984
00:47:28,920 --> 00:47:30,920
That was gamer sense before.

985
00:47:30,920 --> 00:47:31,920
And it was like, are you?

986
00:47:33,920 --> 00:47:35,920
There was a poop in here then.

987
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:37,920
All time we could have got IV bag.

988
00:47:37,920 --> 00:47:38,920
We could have fully healed.

989
00:47:40,920 --> 00:47:43,920
We could have fully healed, but did we?

990
00:47:43,920 --> 00:47:44,920
No.

991
00:47:44,920 --> 00:47:45,920
Yeah, no.

992
00:47:45,920 --> 00:47:49,920
Of course, I destroyed the machine before finding the room.

993
00:47:49,920 --> 00:47:50,920
Okay.

994
00:47:50,920 --> 00:47:51,920
What is it?

995
00:47:51,920 --> 00:47:52,920
Versus pestilence.

996
00:47:52,920 --> 00:47:58,920
So unfortunately, we don't get what is considered a normal boss kind of item.

997
00:48:02,920 --> 00:48:07,920
I really hope the shop is going to start giving us something that helps with fights

998
00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:13,920
because unfortunately, our item rooms, they haven't been lacking too much.

999
00:48:13,920 --> 00:48:16,920
As I said, the angel deal came in close.

1000
00:48:16,920 --> 00:48:20,920
Oh, it's not got ahead when she keeps on sucking.

1001
00:48:20,920 --> 00:48:21,920
You'll lose your hit.

1002
00:48:21,920 --> 00:48:24,920
That's not how anatomy works at all.

1003
00:48:26,920 --> 00:48:28,920
We are going to play it careful.

1004
00:48:30,920 --> 00:48:31,920
I really...

1005
00:48:31,920 --> 00:48:36,920
Again, as I said, if we do unlock the angel room again, I'm going to blow one up.

1006
00:48:36,920 --> 00:48:40,920
But it actually is in our best interest to lose this angel percentage

1007
00:48:40,920 --> 00:48:43,920
because we've already snuck inside and got the item.

1008
00:48:47,920 --> 00:48:48,920
Motherfucker.

1009
00:48:48,920 --> 00:48:50,920
Okay, we're going in.

1010
00:48:50,920 --> 00:48:51,920
Right.

1011
00:48:51,920 --> 00:48:54,920
Get rid of the fire first because that's such a health hazard.

1012
00:48:54,920 --> 00:48:56,920
And then we gift a this.

1013
00:48:56,920 --> 00:48:58,920
Now, if this goes well...

1014
00:48:59,920 --> 00:49:01,920
Oh, there's a thing there as well.

1015
00:49:01,920 --> 00:49:04,920
If this goes well, we can actually fully unlock the key.

1016
00:49:04,920 --> 00:49:07,920
Now, I do have a mod that lets me see where they're going to fire

1017
00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:10,920
because I'm not good enough to not have it.

1018
00:49:10,920 --> 00:49:11,920
I ain't that good.

1019
00:49:11,920 --> 00:49:12,920
I'm not that guy.

1020
00:49:12,920 --> 00:49:13,920
Trust me.

1021
00:49:13,920 --> 00:49:14,920
I'm not that guy.

1022
00:49:14,920 --> 00:49:19,920
We could potentially take on the second angel as well and get the key.

1023
00:49:19,920 --> 00:49:24,920
So we get two key pieces that will maximize our drop.

1024
00:49:27,920 --> 00:49:29,920
We are just playing it safe.

1025
00:49:29,920 --> 00:49:30,920
We did get hit.

1026
00:49:30,920 --> 00:49:37,920
So unfortunately, my holy mantle is gone, but that's okay.

1027
00:49:37,920 --> 00:49:40,920
As I said, it's not too bad.

1028
00:49:40,920 --> 00:49:41,920
I mean, it's alright.

1029
00:49:41,920 --> 00:49:44,920
I would like to keep our eternal heart.

1030
00:49:44,920 --> 00:49:45,920
That's what that white heart.

1031
00:49:45,920 --> 00:49:54,920
If we make it to the next level with it, we will get to keep a whole new red heart.

1032
00:49:54,920 --> 00:49:55,920
So again, oh, he's red.

1033
00:49:55,920 --> 00:49:56,920
Oh, he's raging.

1034
00:49:58,920 --> 00:49:59,920
Slow down, mate.

1035
00:49:59,920 --> 00:50:00,920
Slow down.

1036
00:50:00,920 --> 00:50:01,920
Right.

1037
00:50:01,920 --> 00:50:02,920
You're getting bombed.

1038
00:50:02,920 --> 00:50:03,920
Honestly.

1039
00:50:03,920 --> 00:50:04,920
Okay.

1040
00:50:04,920 --> 00:50:05,920
Well, completely missed.

1041
00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:06,920
Oh, no.

1042
00:50:06,920 --> 00:50:07,920
Oh, no.

1043
00:50:07,920 --> 00:50:08,920
Oh, no.

1044
00:50:08,920 --> 00:50:09,920
I fucked up.

1045
00:50:09,920 --> 00:50:10,920
Bruh.

1046
00:50:11,920 --> 00:50:12,920
Bruh.

1047
00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:14,920
Stop.

1048
00:50:14,920 --> 00:50:15,920
Oh, my God.

1049
00:50:15,920 --> 00:50:17,920
I'm actually going to, I'm going to lose this, please.

1050
00:50:17,920 --> 00:50:19,920
I would like to remain alive.

1051
00:50:19,920 --> 00:50:21,920
I would like to remain well.

1052
00:50:21,920 --> 00:50:22,920
Please get bombed.

1053
00:50:22,920 --> 00:50:23,920
Oh, my God.

1054
00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:25,920
The bomb hardly does anything.

1055
00:50:27,920 --> 00:50:28,920
Oh, my God.

1056
00:50:28,920 --> 00:50:29,920
Sorry.

1057
00:50:29,920 --> 00:50:30,920
I am severe.

1058
00:50:30,920 --> 00:50:32,920
I'm starting to need startups.

1059
00:50:32,920 --> 00:50:35,920
Yeah, I can see the need for the startups.

1060
00:50:35,920 --> 00:50:38,920
Please stop this madness.

1061
00:50:39,920 --> 00:50:40,920
Stop it.

1062
00:50:40,920 --> 00:50:41,920
Stop it.

1063
00:50:41,920 --> 00:50:44,920
You're spawning in too many babies.

1064
00:50:44,920 --> 00:50:45,920
Okay.

1065
00:50:45,920 --> 00:50:46,920
Okay.

1066
00:50:46,920 --> 00:50:47,920
Okay.

1067
00:50:47,920 --> 00:50:48,920
Okay.

1068
00:50:48,920 --> 00:50:49,920
It's fine.

1069
00:50:49,920 --> 00:50:50,920
It's fine.

1070
00:50:50,920 --> 00:50:51,920
We did it.

1071
00:50:51,920 --> 00:50:52,920
We did it.

1072
00:50:52,920 --> 00:50:54,920
We just need to take out this baby.

1073
00:50:54,920 --> 00:50:55,920
Okay.

1074
00:50:55,920 --> 00:50:56,920
There we go.

1075
00:50:56,920 --> 00:50:57,920
Oh, okay.

1076
00:50:57,920 --> 00:51:02,920
We now have increased our angel deal as much as we can outwith like blowing up the shopkeepers,

1077
00:51:02,920 --> 00:51:03,920
for example.

1078
00:51:04,920 --> 00:51:06,920
The angel think you're going to produce gen2?

1079
00:51:06,920 --> 00:51:07,920
Exactly.

1080
00:51:07,920 --> 00:51:08,920
Unconfirmed?

1081
00:51:08,920 --> 00:51:11,920
No, we're not doing angel.

1082
00:51:11,920 --> 00:51:15,920
I'm tempted to go grab that chest.

1083
00:51:15,920 --> 00:51:18,920
I don't know if it's the wisest thing.

1084
00:51:18,920 --> 00:51:26,920
I mean, surely with holy mantle and I'm not going to mess it up so badly.

1085
00:51:26,920 --> 00:51:27,920
Surely.

1086
00:51:27,920 --> 00:51:29,920
And we could get something out of it.

1087
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:30,920
We're going to do it.

1088
00:51:30,920 --> 00:51:31,920
We're going to do it.

1089
00:51:31,920 --> 00:51:32,920
Send it.

1090
00:51:32,920 --> 00:51:33,920
Let's see what we're working with.

1091
00:51:33,920 --> 00:51:34,920
Okay.

1092
00:51:34,920 --> 00:51:35,920
That wasn't bad.

1093
00:51:35,920 --> 00:51:38,920
I just need to not mess up now.

1094
00:51:38,920 --> 00:51:39,920
Focus.

1095
00:51:39,920 --> 00:51:40,920
Focus.

1096
00:51:40,920 --> 00:51:41,920
Focus.

1097
00:51:41,920 --> 00:51:42,920
Concentrate.

1098
00:51:42,920 --> 00:51:43,920
Concentration.

1099
00:51:43,920 --> 00:51:44,920
Patient.

1100
00:51:44,920 --> 00:51:45,920
Patient.

1101
00:51:45,920 --> 00:51:46,920
Okay.

1102
00:51:46,920 --> 00:51:52,920
We're going to pop that on these guys because they like to run at you.

1103
00:51:52,920 --> 00:51:53,920
Yeah.

1104
00:51:53,920 --> 00:51:54,920
That's right.

1105
00:51:54,920 --> 00:51:55,920
I'm on to you.

1106
00:51:55,920 --> 00:51:56,920
Mm-hmm.

1107
00:51:56,920 --> 00:51:57,920
Mm-hmm.

1108
00:51:57,920 --> 00:51:58,920
That's great.

1109
00:51:58,920 --> 00:51:59,920
That's great.

1110
00:51:59,920 --> 00:52:01,920
You're doing shrapnel.

1111
00:52:01,920 --> 00:52:03,920
I've got these guys.

1112
00:52:03,920 --> 00:52:04,920
Okay.

1113
00:52:04,920 --> 00:52:05,920
One more phase.

1114
00:52:05,920 --> 00:52:08,920
Oh, I'm just serious.

1115
00:52:08,920 --> 00:52:12,920
That's the one thing I could perish this game for.

1116
00:52:12,920 --> 00:52:15,920
It's like, oh, let me just blow them up.

1117
00:52:15,920 --> 00:52:18,920
Let me just spawn them on your face and I'm like, no, please don't do that.

1118
00:52:18,920 --> 00:52:20,920
That's not very nice.

1119
00:52:20,920 --> 00:52:23,920
Oh, please stop spawning flies.

1120
00:52:23,920 --> 00:52:26,920
Bro, I ain't got bombs to deal with them.

1121
00:52:26,920 --> 00:52:30,920
I really don't want to lose my little spiral spiral spirit heart.

1122
00:52:30,920 --> 00:52:32,920
It's not spirit heart either.

1123
00:52:32,920 --> 00:52:34,920
Soul heart.

1124
00:52:34,920 --> 00:52:35,920
I didn't.

1125
00:52:35,920 --> 00:52:41,920
I mean, we actually didn't come away any worse.

1126
00:52:41,920 --> 00:52:44,920
I'm catching up at 1.5 speeds.

1127
00:52:44,920 --> 00:52:45,920
Sorry.

1128
00:52:45,920 --> 00:52:50,920
You don't understand how many buttons you add the rest of the other hit.

1129
00:52:50,920 --> 00:52:53,920
I've been left, of course, restoring all the money.

1130
00:52:53,920 --> 00:52:56,920
Oh, lol.

1131
00:52:56,920 --> 00:52:59,920
I think I could stand myself at 1.5.

1132
00:52:59,920 --> 00:53:03,920
She's becoming Neo and dodging every bullet.

1133
00:53:03,920 --> 00:53:04,920
How is this still open?

1134
00:53:04,920 --> 00:53:06,920
Normally like shots.

1135
00:53:06,920 --> 00:53:08,920
Yeah, I was going to say normally shots like that.

1136
00:53:08,920 --> 00:53:09,920
I hate these guys.

1137
00:53:09,920 --> 00:53:12,920
Even worse if their brother who spawns 20 million yellow jump inspired.

1138
00:53:12,920 --> 00:53:14,920
Oh, I hate these booters.

1139
00:53:14,920 --> 00:53:15,920
GG.

1140
00:53:15,920 --> 00:53:17,920
Look.

1141
00:53:17,920 --> 00:53:18,920
Momathon.

1142
00:53:18,920 --> 00:53:20,920
No risk, no reward.

1143
00:53:20,920 --> 00:53:22,920
Oh, we got a chest.

1144
00:53:22,920 --> 00:53:24,920
And before there's nothing in it.

1145
00:53:28,920 --> 00:53:31,920
I'm going to pop the world card just so we know it's up ahead.

1146
00:53:31,920 --> 00:53:32,920
That's not bad.

1147
00:53:32,920 --> 00:53:34,920
If we get a trinket to swallow, then...

1148
00:53:34,920 --> 00:53:36,920
Oh, we've got a library.

1149
00:53:38,920 --> 00:53:40,920
That's not bad.

1150
00:53:40,920 --> 00:53:43,920
Oh, why is it the diagonal?

1151
00:53:43,920 --> 00:53:47,920
Oh, I hate the diagonal ones.

1152
00:53:47,920 --> 00:53:49,920
They're so bad.

1153
00:53:49,920 --> 00:53:50,920
They're so bad.

1154
00:53:50,920 --> 00:53:51,920
Please.

1155
00:53:51,920 --> 00:53:52,920
Please.

1156
00:53:52,920 --> 00:53:54,920
Right, everyone's getting popped right now.

1157
00:53:54,920 --> 00:53:56,920
I've had enough of yous.

1158
00:53:56,920 --> 00:53:58,920
Everyone's getting popped.

1159
00:53:58,920 --> 00:54:01,920
Right, we'll do the secret room and then we'll go to the library.

1160
00:54:01,920 --> 00:54:06,920
Because if we can get double shot, that should increase our DPS by a bit of considerable output.

1161
00:54:08,920 --> 00:54:09,920
Okay.

1162
00:54:12,920 --> 00:54:15,920
I'm going to hopefully get a bomb out of this.

1163
00:54:18,920 --> 00:54:21,920
We might come back for that trinket.

1164
00:54:21,920 --> 00:54:23,920
That's not a bad...

1165
00:54:23,920 --> 00:54:25,920
That is not a bad trinket at all.

1166
00:54:28,920 --> 00:54:31,920
Not a bad trinket for what we have.

1167
00:54:31,920 --> 00:54:33,920
Not bad at all.

1168
00:54:36,920 --> 00:54:39,920
The odds of the shop having...

1169
00:54:41,920 --> 00:54:43,920
I'm just going to pop that.

1170
00:54:43,920 --> 00:54:45,920
And it spawned blue spiders for us.

1171
00:54:45,920 --> 00:54:47,920
The astronomical...

1172
00:54:50,920 --> 00:54:51,920
I'm going to take HP.

1173
00:54:51,920 --> 00:54:52,920
Yep.

1174
00:54:53,920 --> 00:54:55,920
I just knew I should have saved it for this room.

1175
00:54:57,920 --> 00:54:59,920
I could have seen it was a big room.

1176
00:54:59,920 --> 00:55:01,920
I knew I was taking damage.

1177
00:55:01,920 --> 00:55:03,920
These bats are terrible.

1178
00:55:03,920 --> 00:55:05,920
I think they're called zoo bats in game.

1179
00:55:05,920 --> 00:55:07,920
I know Pokemon zoo bats.

1180
00:55:07,920 --> 00:55:08,920
Yes, I know.

1181
00:55:08,920 --> 00:55:10,920
Please, three books.

1182
00:55:11,920 --> 00:55:13,920
Close enough and you come.

1183
00:55:15,920 --> 00:55:16,920
Oh, wait.

1184
00:55:16,920 --> 00:55:19,920
We just got the angel deal on purpose.

1185
00:55:20,920 --> 00:55:22,920
But that gives us infinite health.

1186
00:55:24,920 --> 00:55:25,920
I think...

1187
00:55:25,920 --> 00:55:27,920
I think we're swapping teams already.

1188
00:55:28,920 --> 00:55:30,920
It didn't take as long.

1189
00:55:30,920 --> 00:55:32,920
I think we're swapping teams already.

1190
00:55:32,920 --> 00:55:34,920
Oh, it's Sissy the spider.

1191
00:55:34,920 --> 00:55:35,920
Hi, Sissy.

1192
00:55:35,920 --> 00:55:37,920
Look at the cute little blue spider.

1193
00:55:38,920 --> 00:55:42,920
That sounded like a silverback gorilla came up behind you and squeezed all the air.

1194
00:55:43,920 --> 00:55:44,920
I already popped.

1195
00:55:44,920 --> 00:55:50,920
Your vods are the only ones I've watched at normal speed since you said they spent time is more important than watching the entire vod.

1196
00:55:50,920 --> 00:55:52,920
Yeah, YouTube's so annoying.

1197
00:55:52,920 --> 00:55:55,920
I'm literally tempted by the devil unironically.

1198
00:55:55,920 --> 00:55:57,920
I want to pop it so we have full health.

1199
00:56:00,920 --> 00:56:02,920
That's terrible.

1200
00:56:02,920 --> 00:56:05,920
And I just got the angel deal as well.

1201
00:56:05,920 --> 00:56:06,920
Oh well.

1202
00:56:06,920 --> 00:56:10,920
I prefer playing safer with full health than anything else.

1203
00:56:10,920 --> 00:56:13,920
So please forgive I am a bad...

1204
00:56:13,920 --> 00:56:16,920
Oh, well, that can have gone any worse.

1205
00:56:18,920 --> 00:56:21,920
Please, I hope this shop has something decent inside.

1206
00:56:21,920 --> 00:56:22,920
I'm...

1207
00:56:22,920 --> 00:56:23,920
Or the item room.

1208
00:56:23,920 --> 00:56:24,920
I'll take the item room out.

1209
00:56:24,920 --> 00:56:27,920
Oh, Sissy drops me spiders.

1210
00:56:29,920 --> 00:56:30,920
Is that a bomba?

1211
00:56:30,920 --> 00:56:31,920
Are you a bomba?

1212
00:56:33,920 --> 00:56:38,920
Well, we do have a chance to do mega satan if things go in our favor.

1213
00:56:38,920 --> 00:56:42,920
Whether or not they will, that's different, but you never know.

1214
00:56:42,920 --> 00:56:43,920
Right.

1215
00:56:44,920 --> 00:56:45,920
Good item.

1216
00:56:49,920 --> 00:56:50,920
Are you joking?

1217
00:56:53,920 --> 00:56:54,920
No, not Keynes.

1218
00:56:54,920 --> 00:56:55,920
Oh, yuck.

1219
00:56:55,920 --> 00:56:58,920
My own eye is back.

1220
00:56:58,920 --> 00:57:00,920
Entering a new floor has a chance.

1221
00:57:00,920 --> 00:57:02,920
I wish I really need a swallow pill.

1222
00:57:02,920 --> 00:57:04,920
I need to swallow the trinkets.

1223
00:57:05,920 --> 00:57:09,920
Oh, it's not a greed fight, but it's absolutely rubbish.

1224
00:57:09,920 --> 00:57:11,920
You should be ashamed of yourself.

1225
00:57:11,920 --> 00:57:12,920
What's this?

1226
00:57:12,920 --> 00:57:14,920
The Emperor challenge mode.

1227
00:57:14,920 --> 00:57:16,920
What is with these shops?

1228
00:57:16,920 --> 00:57:17,920
What's that?

1229
00:57:17,920 --> 00:57:18,920
Five plus bombs.

1230
00:57:18,920 --> 00:57:21,920
I mean, 15 quid for five bombs isn't terrible.

1231
00:57:21,920 --> 00:57:25,920
I'll swap out for it and I'm going to see what this pill is all about.

1232
00:57:25,920 --> 00:57:26,920
Because we've not discovered it.

1233
00:57:26,920 --> 00:57:27,920
Please be a swallow...

1234
00:57:27,920 --> 00:57:28,920
pheromones.

1235
00:57:28,920 --> 00:57:31,920
Okay, thanks for wasting my money.

1236
00:57:31,920 --> 00:57:32,920
Money.

1237
00:57:33,920 --> 00:57:34,920
Yeah.

1238
00:57:34,920 --> 00:57:37,920
I'll give it to the judgment.

1239
00:57:37,920 --> 00:57:38,920
He's giving me bombs.

1240
00:57:38,920 --> 00:57:41,920
We do have enough money to go around.

1241
00:57:41,920 --> 00:57:42,920
Yeah.

1242
00:57:43,920 --> 00:57:45,920
It's fine.

1243
00:57:45,920 --> 00:57:46,920
I didn't want...

1244
00:57:46,920 --> 00:57:49,920
It's not like I wanted a billion trinkets anyway.

1245
00:57:51,920 --> 00:57:53,920
I think the secret room's below us right now.

1246
00:57:53,920 --> 00:57:54,920
Because look at...

1247
00:57:54,920 --> 00:57:56,920
See how flat the wall is.

1248
00:57:58,920 --> 00:57:59,920
Yeah.

1249
00:58:00,920 --> 00:58:01,920
You can...

1250
00:58:01,920 --> 00:58:04,920
Right, we are going to bomb these skulls because there's a chance we get...

1251
00:58:06,920 --> 00:58:09,920
I said there's a chance we get a black heart from them,

1252
00:58:09,920 --> 00:58:11,920
but no, no, all of them were like not...

1253
00:58:13,920 --> 00:58:14,920
Right.

1254
00:58:15,920 --> 00:58:18,920
Obviously, I've used the keys already to get in the rooms.

1255
00:58:19,920 --> 00:58:21,920
We've got the hearts for devil deals.

1256
00:58:21,920 --> 00:58:22,920
Don't say it.

1257
00:58:22,920 --> 00:58:23,920
Don't make a flat joke.

1258
00:58:23,920 --> 00:58:24,920
Look.

1259
00:58:27,920 --> 00:58:28,920
You know what?

1260
00:58:28,920 --> 00:58:30,920
Speaking of flat.

1261
00:58:31,920 --> 00:58:32,920
Gen 2.

1262
00:58:32,920 --> 00:58:33,920
That's right.

1263
00:58:33,920 --> 00:58:34,920
Get your facts right.

1264
00:58:34,920 --> 00:58:35,920
I don't know.

1265
00:58:35,920 --> 00:58:36,920
I'm sorry.

1266
00:58:36,920 --> 00:58:37,920
I'm dying.

1267
00:58:40,920 --> 00:58:41,920
But yes.

1268
00:58:41,920 --> 00:58:42,920
I do have a short.

1269
00:58:42,920 --> 00:58:45,920
That reveals how much I earned coming out soon.

1270
00:58:46,920 --> 00:58:48,920
Arissa's been fantastic to work with.

1271
00:58:48,920 --> 00:58:51,920
She's actually about to do a batch for Sheebie.

1272
00:58:51,920 --> 00:58:57,920
I think management's about to do a tweet asking for more Ed tours.

1273
00:58:59,920 --> 00:59:04,920
Because we're kind of sitting about twiddling our thumbs,

1274
00:59:04,920 --> 00:59:05,920
waiting for other people,

1275
00:59:05,920 --> 00:59:09,920
and it's like the contents, they're ready to be edited.

1276
00:59:09,920 --> 00:59:10,920
We're just waiting.

1277
00:59:10,920 --> 00:59:15,920
And obviously, shorts are very important for the growth of...

1278
00:59:15,920 --> 00:59:18,920
Oh my God, Sissy is kind of getting it.

1279
00:59:18,920 --> 00:59:20,920
Sorry, Sissy's doing so well right now.

1280
00:59:20,920 --> 00:59:23,920
Right, we can't go into the curse for free.

1281
00:59:24,920 --> 00:59:30,920
So, if you have Ed in...

1282
00:59:30,920 --> 00:59:31,920
Do we want?

1283
00:59:31,920 --> 00:59:32,920
If we do read,

1284
00:59:32,920 --> 00:59:37,920
then we just focus on getting devil deals now.

1285
00:59:38,920 --> 00:59:39,920
Speaking of that, how is Emmy?

1286
00:59:39,920 --> 00:59:41,920
Emmy's coming home, didn't you know?

1287
00:59:41,920 --> 00:59:43,920
She's actually got a stream.

1288
00:59:43,920 --> 00:59:45,920
She's so excited to stream again.

1289
00:59:45,920 --> 00:59:47,920
She's like missed her big brother so much.

1290
00:59:48,920 --> 00:59:49,920
And before I know it's like,

1291
00:59:49,920 --> 00:59:50,920
that's weird, you're playing into that.

1292
00:59:50,920 --> 00:59:51,920
Fuck you.

1293
00:59:51,920 --> 00:59:53,920
People enjoy things consensually.

1294
00:59:53,920 --> 00:59:55,920
Fucking relax, okay?

1295
00:59:55,920 --> 00:59:57,920
Right, I'm going to bomb him.

1296
00:59:57,920 --> 00:59:59,920
Oh, I haven't got money.

1297
01:00:00,920 --> 01:00:02,920
We are going to get a devil deal,

1298
01:00:02,920 --> 01:00:04,920
a bit of a devil deal.

1299
01:00:05,920 --> 01:00:08,920
We're going to keep the book on our persons.

1300
01:00:08,920 --> 01:00:10,920
I like it because I like planes to proceed

1301
01:00:10,920 --> 01:00:12,920
with like infinite health respawn.

1302
01:00:13,920 --> 01:00:15,920
Do we keep?

1303
01:00:16,920 --> 01:00:19,920
I think actually, you know what we're going to pick up?

1304
01:00:20,920 --> 01:00:27,920
We are going to pick up the restock trinket.

1305
01:00:27,920 --> 01:00:30,920
And we're going to say goodbye to counterfeit penny.

1306
01:00:30,920 --> 01:00:31,920
You've done fantastic.

1307
01:00:31,920 --> 01:00:33,920
You've absolutely boosted our economy out the wazoo.

1308
01:00:33,920 --> 01:00:35,920
But now that we have 4% luck,

1309
01:00:35,920 --> 01:00:39,920
our drop rate is high enough to enjoy what it's worth.

1310
01:00:39,920 --> 01:00:42,920
Play into your gen mates theme, thinking.

1311
01:00:42,920 --> 01:00:43,920
How dare...

1312
01:00:43,920 --> 01:00:46,920
Motherfucker, I created Emmy in that image.

1313
01:00:46,920 --> 01:00:48,920
I'm sorry, I see this again.

1314
01:00:48,920 --> 01:00:50,920
Emmy is created in my image.

1315
01:00:50,920 --> 01:00:53,920
If I had a lighter voice, it would be over for you fuckers.

1316
01:00:53,920 --> 01:00:54,920
It would...

1317
01:00:54,920 --> 01:00:55,920
How did I already get hit?

1318
01:00:55,920 --> 01:00:57,920
Was I not paying attention?

1319
01:00:59,920 --> 01:01:01,920
God, I really need some devil,

1320
01:01:01,920 --> 01:01:03,920
good devil items to come through.

1321
01:01:05,920 --> 01:01:07,920
She's like everything I want to be.

1322
01:01:09,920 --> 01:01:12,920
Small, cute, adorable, absolutely outrageous, yes.

1323
01:01:13,920 --> 01:01:17,920
But I don't have a light voice, so I can't do that.

1324
01:01:19,920 --> 01:01:21,920
Unless you guys want like...

1325
01:01:21,920 --> 01:01:23,920
Was it the gap mo?

1326
01:01:23,920 --> 01:01:25,920
I remember when you guys taught me what gap mo means.

1327
01:01:25,920 --> 01:01:27,920
I was like gap mo, huh?

1328
01:01:27,920 --> 01:01:28,920
What does that mean?

1329
01:01:29,920 --> 01:01:32,920
Unless you want the gap mo to be astronomical,

1330
01:01:32,920 --> 01:01:35,920
and we just end up getting a lollipop version of me.

1331
01:01:35,920 --> 01:01:37,920
And I still sound the exact same.

1332
01:01:37,920 --> 01:01:39,920
My voice doesn't change at all.

1333
01:01:39,920 --> 01:01:41,920
I'm just like, who goes, how's it going?

1334
01:01:41,920 --> 01:01:42,920
I'm strong here.

1335
01:01:42,920 --> 01:01:44,920
Do you mean it looks cool that you knew?

1336
01:01:44,920 --> 01:01:45,920
Why?

1337
01:01:46,920 --> 01:01:47,920
What is gap mo?

1338
01:01:47,920 --> 01:01:51,920
Gap mo is when you're designing your voice

1339
01:01:51,920 --> 01:01:52,920
and attitudes and...

1340
01:01:52,920 --> 01:01:53,920
Are you joking?

1341
01:01:53,920 --> 01:01:54,920
Don't...

1342
01:01:59,920 --> 01:02:00,920
Give me that.

1343
01:02:02,920 --> 01:02:03,920
Right.

1344
01:02:04,920 --> 01:02:07,920
We've got two orbitals now.

1345
01:02:07,920 --> 01:02:09,920
That didn't do anything.

1346
01:02:11,920 --> 01:02:13,920
And there's nothing in the shop.

1347
01:02:13,920 --> 01:02:14,920
Right, okay.

1348
01:02:14,920 --> 01:02:15,920
There's no point in hanging about

1349
01:02:15,920 --> 01:02:17,920
if we didn't get the devil deal.

1350
01:02:17,920 --> 01:02:18,920
Right, off we pop.

1351
01:02:20,920 --> 01:02:21,920
I want a lollipop.

1352
01:02:21,920 --> 01:02:22,920
You're going to gap mo.

1353
01:02:22,920 --> 01:02:24,920
I'm going to gap mo all over you.

1354
01:02:24,920 --> 01:02:26,920
Petition for saying all the letters in mo.

1355
01:02:26,920 --> 01:02:27,920
Moe.

1356
01:02:27,920 --> 01:02:28,920
Oh, gap moe.

1357
01:02:28,920 --> 01:02:30,920
I want lollipop strong now.

1358
01:02:30,920 --> 01:02:32,920
Honestly, that'd be hilarious.

1359
01:02:34,920 --> 01:02:35,920
I don't...

1360
01:02:35,920 --> 01:02:36,920
I wouldn't mind it.

1361
01:02:36,920 --> 01:02:37,920
I think that would be funny.

1362
01:02:37,920 --> 01:02:38,920
It's probably being like,

1363
01:02:38,920 --> 01:02:39,920
Hi guys, how's it going?

1364
01:02:39,920 --> 01:02:40,920
I'm strong here.

1365
01:02:40,920 --> 01:02:41,920
Like in my deep voice.

1366
01:02:41,920 --> 01:02:42,920
Everyone's like,

1367
01:02:42,920 --> 01:02:44,920
You don't sound like you think at all.

1368
01:02:44,920 --> 01:02:45,920
Oh, I peed myself.

1369
01:02:47,920 --> 01:02:49,920
Thank you, Broly Legend, for the tip.

1370
01:02:49,920 --> 01:02:50,920
Um...

1371
01:02:52,920 --> 01:02:53,920
I'm sorry.

1372
01:02:53,920 --> 01:02:54,920
I'm sorry.

1373
01:02:54,920 --> 01:02:55,920
I'm sorry.

1374
01:02:55,920 --> 01:02:56,920
I'm sorry.

1375
01:02:56,920 --> 01:02:57,920
I'm sorry.

1376
01:02:58,920 --> 01:02:59,920
What?

1377
01:03:00,920 --> 01:03:03,920
See, this isn't the thing about Binding of Isaac.

1378
01:03:03,920 --> 01:03:05,920
You can play so much

1379
01:03:05,920 --> 01:03:08,920
and you end up getting like the most random rooms

1380
01:03:08,920 --> 01:03:10,920
you've never seen in your life before.

1381
01:03:10,920 --> 01:03:11,920
I can see that tinted rocks.

1382
01:03:11,920 --> 01:03:12,920
I'm just gonna...

1383
01:03:13,920 --> 01:03:14,920
Oh, and it misses both of them.

1384
01:03:16,920 --> 01:03:17,920
You know what I think about you?

1385
01:03:17,920 --> 01:03:19,920
You farts, honestly.

1386
01:03:20,920 --> 01:03:21,920
Honestly.

1387
01:03:22,920 --> 01:03:24,920
We are needing stat up.

1388
01:03:24,920 --> 01:03:30,320
We are needing stat-ups, we're needing pills, we're needing anything because this is getting

1389
01:03:30,320 --> 01:03:32,840
a bit of a donk y'all aren't you mate?

1390
01:03:32,840 --> 01:03:41,960
Okay, we're gonna pop this so we're definitely gonna have high priestess.

1391
01:03:41,960 --> 01:03:46,000
There may be sacrifice room on floor, maybe?

1392
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:51,600
Oh, I wasn't paying attention sorry.

1393
01:03:52,600 --> 01:03:57,600
Hmm, I've never seen that if only you could throw keys at an enemy.

1394
01:03:57,600 --> 01:04:01,600
Hey wait a minute that's an item.

1395
01:04:01,600 --> 01:04:05,600
Just out of curiosity is there a girl and veeler that isn't in a pet play?

1396
01:04:05,600 --> 01:04:06,600
What?

1397
01:04:06,600 --> 01:04:09,440
Wait until you hear the logic behind it.

1398
01:04:09,440 --> 01:04:13,120
Remember that time I told you guys that women don't like it if you treat animals cruelly?

1399
01:04:13,120 --> 01:04:15,120
Hmm, I wonder why, smile.

1400
01:04:15,120 --> 01:04:17,440
Oh for goodness sake!

1401
01:04:18,440 --> 01:04:23,440
You're so dramatic, you're so dramatic Keen, get up!

1402
01:04:23,440 --> 01:04:27,440
Is that a double tinted rock behind the skull?

1403
01:04:27,440 --> 01:04:29,440
Am I going crazy?

1404
01:04:29,440 --> 01:04:33,440
No it is a double tinted rock, I knew it!

1405
01:04:33,440 --> 01:04:36,440
I knew it was a double tinted rock.

1406
01:04:40,440 --> 01:04:46,440
I know we don't have to kill this but out of principle perish.

1407
01:04:46,440 --> 01:04:52,440
Again these red fires can only shoot one fire at you, they can't shoot anymore.

1408
01:04:52,440 --> 01:04:56,440
So don't get too scared now, don't hurt them now.

1409
01:04:56,440 --> 01:05:00,440
Okay so we do have that knife orbital so we can play a bit dangerous.

1410
01:05:00,440 --> 01:05:07,440
If we time it correctly we can just jam the knife in the enemies but you know you have to make sure you don't mess it up.

1411
01:05:07,440 --> 01:05:09,440
Or else you're just taking XP damage.

1412
01:05:09,440 --> 01:05:13,440
Although we do have holy mantle which is negating a heck of a lot of damage.

1413
01:05:13,440 --> 01:05:15,440
Yeah again, here we go.

1414
01:05:15,440 --> 01:05:20,440
See we just shove our wee orbitals in it and Bob's your auntie, Uncle's your fan or something.

1415
01:05:20,440 --> 01:05:22,440
Shit, I feel bad.

1416
01:05:22,440 --> 01:05:23,440
Pills!

1417
01:05:23,440 --> 01:05:25,440
Why we got speed up?

1418
01:05:25,440 --> 01:05:27,440
Look up.

1419
01:05:27,440 --> 01:05:29,440
What's that one, hold on, hold on.

1420
01:05:29,440 --> 01:05:31,440
Oh sorry I've lost my hang.

1421
01:05:31,440 --> 01:05:33,440
Unidentified Pills.

1422
01:05:33,440 --> 01:05:35,440
48 hour energy, sure pop it.

1423
01:05:37,440 --> 01:05:41,440
We don't actually need to do this room so we'll just teleport to the enemy.

1424
01:05:41,440 --> 01:05:44,440
We've got Sister Viss.

1425
01:05:44,440 --> 01:05:46,440
Sister Viss.

1426
01:05:46,440 --> 01:05:50,440
So we're maybe just do orbital knife on these guys?

1427
01:05:50,440 --> 01:05:57,440
Although I would like to maintain my face.

1428
01:05:57,440 --> 01:06:01,440
That was so extreme and you know it was extreme.

1429
01:06:01,440 --> 01:06:03,440
That was insane.

1430
01:06:04,440 --> 01:06:06,440
Oh.

1431
01:06:08,440 --> 01:06:10,440
I should maybe just do more.

1432
01:06:10,440 --> 01:06:12,440
Right one's down.

1433
01:06:15,440 --> 01:06:18,440
Did I just get to stay in astral form?

1434
01:06:20,440 --> 01:06:22,440
Why am I so bad?

1435
01:06:22,440 --> 01:06:23,440
No!

1436
01:06:23,440 --> 01:06:25,440
Right you're getting nuked.

1437
01:06:26,440 --> 01:06:28,440
I'm so bad.

1438
01:06:28,440 --> 01:06:30,440
Oh we get Bookworm.

1439
01:06:31,440 --> 01:06:33,440
Right, ultimate.

1440
01:06:33,440 --> 01:06:35,440
Grab this.

1441
01:06:35,440 --> 01:06:38,440
So we've got Bookworm but I'm keeping this because it's infinite health.

1442
01:06:38,440 --> 01:06:41,440
And we're going to the El Diablo deal and we're just grabbing it.

1443
01:06:43,440 --> 01:06:45,440
Thank you El Diablo.

1444
01:06:45,440 --> 01:06:47,440
We have our Drosidae Vildil.

1445
01:06:49,440 --> 01:06:50,440
Received that.

1446
01:06:50,440 --> 01:06:52,440
No, see it doesn't give me infinite health.

1447
01:06:52,440 --> 01:06:54,440
God how far in the map did we?

1448
01:06:54,440 --> 01:06:56,440
Whoa this is a big map, isn't it?

1449
01:06:56,440 --> 01:06:58,440
It's not an XLR4.

1450
01:06:59,440 --> 01:07:02,440
The purple, red can keep firing you.

1451
01:07:02,440 --> 01:07:04,440
You want it?

1452
01:07:04,440 --> 01:07:09,440
You want me, I'll sit here and prove that the red only shoots once.

1453
01:07:09,440 --> 01:07:11,440
Sorry that was gamer instinct, I just knew.

1454
01:07:11,440 --> 01:07:15,440
I know it doesn't make sense but I just knew, okay.

1455
01:07:17,440 --> 01:07:20,440
Oh, that was not the one we wanted but hey ho.

1456
01:07:25,440 --> 01:07:27,440
Actually, oh we got Lucky Penny.

1457
01:07:27,440 --> 01:07:29,440
We're at 6 luck.

1458
01:07:29,440 --> 01:07:32,440
If we could get a trinket that had something like that.

1459
01:07:36,440 --> 01:07:38,440
I keep dropping more heart.

1460
01:07:40,440 --> 01:07:43,440
Okay, we're literally full on money.

1461
01:07:43,440 --> 01:07:46,440
Thank you, a key beggar.

1462
01:07:46,440 --> 01:07:48,440
Maybe not right now.

1463
01:07:49,440 --> 01:07:53,440
No, rooms like this I wish we had flying.

1464
01:07:54,440 --> 01:07:56,440
Holy moly.

1465
01:07:56,440 --> 01:07:59,440
The bugs are coming.

1466
01:08:00,440 --> 01:08:03,440
We need to be careful of the bugs.

1467
01:08:03,440 --> 01:08:06,440
They're gonna steal my little holy mantle.

1468
01:08:06,440 --> 01:08:09,440
You wouldn't steal my holy mantle, would you?

1469
01:08:09,440 --> 01:08:11,440
A wild card.

1470
01:08:11,440 --> 01:08:13,440
Are you squiddin' me right now?

1471
01:08:13,440 --> 01:08:14,440
Kiff?

1472
01:08:14,440 --> 01:08:15,440
Charly?

1473
01:08:15,440 --> 01:08:17,440
I think I said that right.

1474
01:08:17,440 --> 01:08:20,440
Thank you for the tip, I appreciate it.

1475
01:08:21,440 --> 01:08:27,440
You're literally reducing the gen 2 goal.

1476
01:08:27,440 --> 01:08:29,440
Not even kidding.

1477
01:08:29,440 --> 01:08:33,440
I very much expected a greed fight.

1478
01:08:33,440 --> 01:08:35,440
I am not at all surprised.

1479
01:08:40,440 --> 01:08:42,440
Whoa, good block.

1480
01:08:42,440 --> 01:08:48,440
Good block on the orbital knife.

1481
01:08:48,440 --> 01:08:50,440
That was a fantastic block.

1482
01:08:50,440 --> 01:08:53,440
No, stop spitting out spiders, I'm getting annoyed.

1483
01:08:53,440 --> 01:08:56,440
No, don't give me double spiders please.

1484
01:08:56,440 --> 01:08:58,440
Okay, the mulligan fly.

1485
01:08:58,440 --> 01:09:01,440
We need to perish because they always hit me when they're on a poopy.

1486
01:09:01,440 --> 01:09:05,440
We need to find gen 2 before the donor thun so we can focus on gen 3.

1487
01:09:05,440 --> 01:09:07,440
You want me to pop out gen 3?

1488
01:09:07,440 --> 01:09:09,440
We haven't even been a 2 months here yet.

1489
01:09:09,440 --> 01:09:11,440
We haven't even been a hero.

1490
01:09:12,440 --> 01:09:14,440
Whoa!

1491
01:09:14,440 --> 01:09:16,440
Whoa!

1492
01:09:16,440 --> 01:09:20,440
Okay, my tears are now connected with damage.

1493
01:09:20,440 --> 01:09:23,440
Oh my god.

1494
01:09:23,440 --> 01:09:27,440
There's no way, hey, hey, hey.

1495
01:09:27,440 --> 01:09:32,440
Now there should, there looks like there's going to be a secret room here at the bottom.

1496
01:09:34,440 --> 01:09:35,440
What?

1497
01:09:35,440 --> 01:09:37,440
Oh come on mate, cheeky.

1498
01:09:37,440 --> 01:09:39,440
Okay, there we go, we got both our secrets.

1499
01:09:40,440 --> 01:09:42,440
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

1500
01:09:42,440 --> 01:09:44,440
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

1501
01:09:44,440 --> 01:09:47,440
Give me that bad boy, are you joking me?

1502
01:09:47,440 --> 01:09:53,440
So we did just take a tier reduction, but the reason why that's so good,

1503
01:09:53,440 --> 01:09:56,440
as if that didn't push the thing up there,

1504
01:09:56,440 --> 01:10:01,440
we now can block enemy projectiles by firing.

1505
01:10:01,440 --> 01:10:05,440
That's right, according to the encyclopedia of,

1506
01:10:05,440 --> 01:10:08,440
we are what's called MLG proof.

1507
01:10:08,440 --> 01:10:11,440
Nope.

1508
01:10:11,440 --> 01:10:15,440
Oh, that didn't get the guy on the bottom.

1509
01:10:15,440 --> 01:10:17,440
Ooh.

1510
01:10:17,440 --> 01:10:19,440
Hey, I'm going to pop my ult.

1511
01:10:19,440 --> 01:10:21,440
I should probably hold it for the next floor.

1512
01:10:21,440 --> 01:10:22,440
Hold!

1513
01:10:22,440 --> 01:10:24,440
But it's fine.

1514
01:10:24,440 --> 01:10:26,440
Yeah, holy crap.

1515
01:10:26,440 --> 01:10:29,440
I can't believe we're doing a mega scene.

1516
01:10:30,440 --> 01:10:32,440
I'll take that to the next floor.

1517
01:10:32,440 --> 01:10:35,440
Unless this card up here is way better.

1518
01:10:35,440 --> 01:10:36,440
I don't know.

1519
01:10:36,440 --> 01:10:38,440
Still got zero damage.

1520
01:10:38,440 --> 01:10:41,440
I knew, I knew, I knew damage.

1521
01:10:41,440 --> 01:10:44,440
Weird damage, no damage.

1522
01:10:44,440 --> 01:10:49,440
Okay, we'll grab this heart and then we are good to jump off this floor.

1523
01:10:49,440 --> 01:10:51,440
Now we have had one greed fight.

1524
01:10:51,440 --> 01:10:55,440
I believe the next floor is our last chance for a shock.

1525
01:10:55,440 --> 01:10:58,440
So if we get a greedy greed fight,

1526
01:10:58,440 --> 01:11:00,440
it's ogre.

1527
01:11:00,440 --> 01:11:05,440
I don't know if I should use this key burger.

1528
01:11:05,440 --> 01:11:08,440
I'm going to go for it.

1529
01:11:08,440 --> 01:11:10,440
Now I might regret it,

1530
01:11:10,440 --> 01:11:11,440
but I might not.

1531
01:11:11,440 --> 01:11:12,440
Have you ever thought about that?

1532
01:11:12,440 --> 01:11:14,440
Okay, I regret it.

1533
01:11:14,440 --> 01:11:18,440
We'll go down to what?

1534
01:11:18,440 --> 01:11:19,440
I don't know.

1535
01:11:19,440 --> 01:11:21,440
Okay.

1536
01:11:21,440 --> 01:11:23,440
Brave.

1537
01:11:23,440 --> 01:11:25,440
Brave.

1538
01:11:25,440 --> 01:11:28,440
Okay, we'll go down to 10 keys.

1539
01:11:28,440 --> 01:11:31,440
Okay, give me that.

1540
01:11:35,440 --> 01:11:38,440
10 keys.

1541
01:11:38,440 --> 01:11:42,440
And here's a gift for you.

1542
01:11:42,440 --> 01:11:47,440
I enjoyed every second of that.

1543
01:11:47,440 --> 01:11:50,440
I don't want to go to that chest because I'm too lazy.

1544
01:11:50,440 --> 01:11:51,440
Look at all that money.

1545
01:11:51,440 --> 01:11:53,440
I know I'm literally max money.

1546
01:11:53,440 --> 01:11:55,440
The game is like more.

1547
01:11:55,440 --> 01:11:57,440
I'm like, no.

1548
01:11:57,440 --> 01:12:01,440
Low shot speed is always nice.

1549
01:12:01,440 --> 01:12:03,440
You can still pick up the batteries.

1550
01:12:03,440 --> 01:12:05,440
Oops, did I forget the batteries?

1551
01:12:05,440 --> 01:12:10,440
Okay, so this is our last chance for a shock.

1552
01:12:10,440 --> 01:12:12,440
Is it going to be a greed fight?

1553
01:12:12,440 --> 01:12:13,440
Odd say yet.

1554
01:12:13,440 --> 01:12:15,440
Our survey says I.

1555
01:12:15,440 --> 01:12:18,440
Okay, we can bomb the absolute...

1556
01:12:18,440 --> 01:12:20,440
Mmm.

1557
01:12:20,440 --> 01:12:22,440
Okay, our devil deal went up, which is good.

1558
01:12:22,440 --> 01:12:24,440
Good.

1559
01:12:24,440 --> 01:12:26,440
Okay, we have this.

1560
01:12:26,440 --> 01:12:28,440
What are we looking at?

1561
01:12:28,440 --> 01:12:30,440
What are we looking at?

1562
01:12:30,440 --> 01:12:34,440
See, Holy Mantle is so OP.

1563
01:12:34,440 --> 01:12:36,440
I am very happy.

1564
01:12:36,440 --> 01:12:38,440
No, don't jump.

1565
01:12:38,440 --> 01:12:39,440
I hate him.

1566
01:12:39,440 --> 01:12:42,440
He jumps and he's stinky because he lands on your head.

1567
01:12:42,440 --> 01:12:44,440
Oh, please.

1568
01:12:44,440 --> 01:12:45,440
Okay, that's better.

1569
01:12:45,440 --> 01:12:48,440
Okay, I'm just going to pop out so we have all black hearts.

1570
01:12:48,440 --> 01:12:50,440
So if we do get heart,

1571
01:12:50,440 --> 01:12:54,440
the game says nephronomic effect smile.

1572
01:12:54,440 --> 01:12:58,440
All right, I do this.

1573
01:12:58,440 --> 01:13:02,440
There's no way.

1574
01:13:02,440 --> 01:13:05,440
Either this one's going to go good or not.

1575
01:13:05,440 --> 01:13:07,440
Oh, I came to Lake Leech.

1576
01:13:07,440 --> 01:13:08,440
I'm sorry.

1577
01:13:08,440 --> 01:13:11,440
I think leech is a cute bit to me, but I think we can do better.

1578
01:13:11,440 --> 01:13:14,440
All right, we'll grab this.

1579
01:13:14,440 --> 01:13:15,440
I like leech.

1580
01:13:15,440 --> 01:13:16,440
I do.

1581
01:13:16,440 --> 01:13:19,440
Are we going to blue baby?

1582
01:13:19,440 --> 01:13:20,440
Up or down?

1583
01:13:20,440 --> 01:13:23,440
I think we may have to go down.

1584
01:13:23,440 --> 01:13:25,440
No, not unicorn stump.

1585
01:13:25,440 --> 01:13:27,440
Thanks for the attempt though.

1586
01:13:27,440 --> 01:13:28,440
No, not anti-gravy.

1587
01:13:28,440 --> 01:13:29,440
You suck.

1588
01:13:29,440 --> 01:13:30,440
No, not scatterbombs.

1589
01:13:30,440 --> 01:13:31,440
You suck.

1590
01:13:31,440 --> 01:13:34,440
We should have taken leech.

1591
01:13:34,440 --> 01:13:38,440
It's going to blow up on the next one, I think.

1592
01:13:38,440 --> 01:13:41,440
Are you...

1593
01:13:41,440 --> 01:13:47,440
I should have taken the leech, the cute little wiggly boy.

1594
01:13:47,440 --> 01:13:51,440
Sometimes it's all about taking a wiggly boy, OK?

1595
01:13:51,440 --> 01:13:52,440
So...

1596
01:13:52,440 --> 01:13:54,440
Oh, I lost my heart doing that.

1597
01:13:54,440 --> 01:13:57,440
I thought I was being so smart, being like, ha ha ha.

1598
01:13:57,440 --> 01:13:59,440
Ugh.

1599
01:13:59,440 --> 01:14:02,440
Well, it's fine.

1600
01:14:02,440 --> 01:14:04,440
Sometimes good enough is best.

1601
01:14:04,440 --> 01:14:06,440
Literally, the game punishes you for thinking,

1602
01:14:06,440 --> 01:14:10,440
for having the audacity to try and get better.

1603
01:14:10,440 --> 01:14:12,440
Uh...

1604
01:14:12,440 --> 01:14:13,440
What?

1605
01:14:13,440 --> 01:14:16,440
Is there a room, potentially?

1606
01:14:16,440 --> 01:14:20,440
Uh, I don't have an orbital.

1607
01:14:20,440 --> 01:14:23,440
OK, the electricity does help with guys like that,

1608
01:14:23,440 --> 01:14:25,440
where they can only be hurt from one side.

1609
01:14:25,440 --> 01:14:27,440
I do see the tinted rock.

1610
01:14:27,440 --> 01:14:29,440
I mean, maybe we'll get a golden chest out of it.

1611
01:14:29,440 --> 01:14:32,440
I'd rather we actually get golden chests

1612
01:14:32,440 --> 01:14:34,440
and the chance to spawn an item,

1613
01:14:34,440 --> 01:14:37,440
or keys, I guess.

1614
01:14:37,440 --> 01:14:43,440
Uh, than, like, anything else at the moment.

1615
01:14:44,440 --> 01:14:48,440
But yes, we're going to do cane.

1616
01:14:48,440 --> 01:14:52,440
And if I have yapped a bit too quickly,

1617
01:14:52,440 --> 01:14:59,440
then I think we'll give a Zazzle a cheeky run, as well.

1618
01:14:59,440 --> 01:15:02,440
A Zazzle actually starts with flight.

1619
01:15:02,440 --> 01:15:04,440
Now, whenever you play this game,

1620
01:15:04,440 --> 01:15:06,440
you notice that flight is very valuable,

1621
01:15:06,440 --> 01:15:08,440
not only for mobility,

1622
01:15:08,440 --> 01:15:11,440
but to get access to items otherwise you wouldn't.

1623
01:15:11,440 --> 01:15:13,440
For example, we don't have access to that money.

1624
01:15:13,440 --> 01:15:16,440
Now, we're lucky our economy is so high that we don't nest,

1625
01:15:16,440 --> 01:15:18,440
so there's a sputter.

1626
01:15:18,440 --> 01:15:20,440
Get that sputter!

1627
01:15:20,440 --> 01:15:22,440
We don't actually need it.

1628
01:15:22,440 --> 01:15:24,440
Is there a tinted rock?

1629
01:15:24,440 --> 01:15:28,440
I can spot it in here.

1630
01:15:28,440 --> 01:15:30,440
With your bad eyesight.

1631
01:15:30,440 --> 01:15:31,440
Oh, gee, son, is that you?

1632
01:15:31,440 --> 01:15:34,440
I'm teasing, I'm teasing.

1633
01:15:34,440 --> 01:15:36,440
Ooh!

1634
01:15:37,440 --> 01:15:43,440
I am so bad at reacting to that.

1635
01:15:43,440 --> 01:15:46,440
I just was like, yeah, smile.

1636
01:15:46,440 --> 01:15:49,440
No, we could have had a leech on our side.

1637
01:15:49,440 --> 01:15:51,440
No.

1638
01:15:51,440 --> 01:15:52,440
The game's taunting me.

1639
01:15:52,440 --> 01:15:54,440
I could have had a leech friend.

1640
01:15:58,440 --> 01:16:00,440
Spitters are quitters.

1641
01:16:00,440 --> 01:16:01,440
Flight is for cowards.

1642
01:16:01,440 --> 01:16:04,440
No, it's so OP, though.

1643
01:16:06,440 --> 01:16:08,440
Okay, what happened?

1644
01:16:08,440 --> 01:16:10,440
Is there a rock?

1645
01:16:10,440 --> 01:16:11,440
I can't even see.

1646
01:16:11,440 --> 01:16:13,440
Oh, there's a gap in the ground.

1647
01:16:13,440 --> 01:16:16,440
I can't even see what I'm supposed to be aiming for right now.

1648
01:16:16,440 --> 01:16:19,440
Okay, here's the moment.

1649
01:16:19,440 --> 01:16:21,440
Oh!

1650
01:16:21,440 --> 01:16:23,440
As if it just did that.

1651
01:16:23,440 --> 01:16:26,440
Lol.

1652
01:16:26,440 --> 01:16:28,440
As if it just did that.

1653
01:16:28,440 --> 01:16:30,440
See, this is why holy mantles clutch.

1654
01:16:30,440 --> 01:16:32,440
Last time I was saved by the...

1655
01:16:32,440 --> 01:16:35,440
Wow, that's...

1656
01:16:35,440 --> 01:16:38,440
If the shops could be any more disappointing,

1657
01:16:38,440 --> 01:16:41,440
I don't even think this is possible.

1658
01:16:41,440 --> 01:16:44,440
Now, normally I'd be like, yay, vault,

1659
01:16:44,440 --> 01:16:47,440
but I actually don't think we want to.

1660
01:16:47,440 --> 01:16:49,440
I don't, it's not...

1661
01:16:49,440 --> 01:16:54,440
We have such low damage to recharge.

1662
01:16:54,440 --> 01:16:56,440
It's like damage per 4 increases,

1663
01:16:56,440 --> 01:16:59,440
like, nah, we're literally going to take ourselves away

1664
01:16:59,440 --> 01:17:01,440
from even having the...

1665
01:17:01,440 --> 01:17:04,440
Did that really get me?

1666
01:17:04,440 --> 01:17:05,440
See these wee hings?

1667
01:17:05,440 --> 01:17:10,440
I've got nothing but the audacity to tell you that much.

1668
01:17:10,440 --> 01:17:15,440
Is there really no sacrifice floor?

1669
01:17:15,440 --> 01:17:17,440
And I've popped the book.

1670
01:17:17,440 --> 01:17:18,440
I better have popped the book.

1671
01:17:18,440 --> 01:17:20,440
Oh!

1672
01:17:20,440 --> 01:17:22,440
I need my glegs on.

1673
01:17:22,440 --> 01:17:24,440
I'm saying, oh, you've not got your glegs on.

1674
01:17:24,440 --> 01:17:25,440
I've not got my glegs on.

1675
01:17:25,440 --> 01:17:26,440
Honestly.

1676
01:17:26,440 --> 01:17:28,440
As you get for questioning my loyalty,

1677
01:17:28,440 --> 01:17:30,440
we got tricked with the backstab.

1678
01:17:30,440 --> 01:17:32,440
Honestly.

1679
01:17:32,440 --> 01:17:34,440
Not one sacrifice floor.

1680
01:17:34,440 --> 01:17:37,440
I'm so sorry to backtrack,

1681
01:17:37,440 --> 01:17:43,440
but the value of having a sacrifice room

1682
01:17:43,440 --> 01:17:45,440
is like pretty high because we have old bandage,

1683
01:17:45,440 --> 01:17:48,440
but we got it once and then the game was like,

1684
01:17:48,440 --> 01:17:50,440
nope, that was your one chance to shine.

1685
01:17:50,440 --> 01:17:51,440
Never again.

1686
01:17:51,440 --> 01:17:54,440
I'm like, okay.

1687
01:17:54,440 --> 01:17:56,440
Of course you get me.

1688
01:17:56,440 --> 01:17:59,440
Like, you're not even near me.

1689
01:17:59,440 --> 01:18:00,440
Right.

1690
01:18:00,440 --> 01:18:02,440
We'll see you perish.

1691
01:18:02,440 --> 01:18:04,440
I did all that backtracking for a chest.

1692
01:18:04,440 --> 01:18:06,440
Enter an unclear boss.

1693
01:18:06,440 --> 01:18:09,440
Fully recharges the activity.

1694
01:18:09,440 --> 01:18:11,440
Wow.

1695
01:18:11,440 --> 01:18:13,440
That was rubbish.

1696
01:18:13,440 --> 01:18:15,440
Once again, I'd like to thank Holy Mantle

1697
01:18:15,440 --> 01:18:17,440
for carrying us exactly.

1698
01:18:17,440 --> 01:18:21,440
Without you, I could bomb that thing back there.

1699
01:18:21,440 --> 01:18:23,440
I'll try.

1700
01:18:23,440 --> 01:18:24,440
Literally carried by the wafer,

1701
01:18:24,440 --> 01:18:25,440
carried by Holy Mantle,

1702
01:18:25,440 --> 01:18:29,440
and now getting again with the three and not a card.

1703
01:18:29,440 --> 01:18:31,440
Rubbish.

1704
01:18:34,440 --> 01:18:36,440
You can take it.

1705
01:18:36,440 --> 01:18:37,440
What, the trinket?

1706
01:18:37,440 --> 01:18:39,440
Oh, you're right.

1707
01:18:39,440 --> 01:18:40,440
This is the last floor.

1708
01:18:40,440 --> 01:18:44,440
I could have done anything with this current trinket,

1709
01:18:44,440 --> 01:18:45,440
which is pay to win.

1710
01:18:45,440 --> 01:18:47,440
Sorry for the backtracking.

1711
01:18:48,440 --> 01:18:53,440
Yes.

1712
01:18:53,440 --> 01:18:57,440
Mercy has a full video coming out on her channel soon.

1713
01:18:57,440 --> 01:19:00,440
For you who use Holy Harvester,

1714
01:19:00,440 --> 01:19:02,440
we're so shocked she played it.

1715
01:19:02,440 --> 01:19:04,440
Yes, she's getting a highlight reel of it

1716
01:19:04,440 --> 01:19:06,440
because she just loved it so much.

1717
01:19:06,440 --> 01:19:10,440
But management's going to tweet out

1718
01:19:10,440 --> 01:19:15,440
that we need editors for Shorts

1719
01:19:15,440 --> 01:19:19,440
and for, oh, why did that glitch out?

1720
01:19:19,440 --> 01:19:22,440
I have the mod that lets you see her foot coming down,

1721
01:19:22,440 --> 01:19:24,440
but I think it's bugging out right now.

1722
01:19:24,440 --> 01:19:26,440
I don't know what blue mum means.

1723
01:19:26,440 --> 01:19:27,440
I don't know if it means she's more aggressive.

1724
01:19:27,440 --> 01:19:29,440
Oh, I've lost already.

1725
01:19:29,440 --> 01:19:33,440
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

1726
01:19:33,440 --> 01:19:35,440
Oh, no.

1727
01:19:35,440 --> 01:19:36,440
This can't be.

1728
01:19:36,440 --> 01:19:37,440
I'm going to lose.

1729
01:19:37,440 --> 01:19:39,440
We are solo energy.

1730
01:19:39,440 --> 01:19:42,440
Sorry, we're having to take the negative

1731
01:19:42,440 --> 01:19:45,440
because this is insane.

1732
01:19:45,440 --> 01:19:48,440
This is absolutely terrible.

1733
01:19:48,440 --> 01:19:51,440
No stat upgrades, actually.

1734
01:19:51,440 --> 01:19:54,440
If anything, stat down because lost contact,

1735
01:19:54,440 --> 01:19:58,440
but her stat's down.

1736
01:19:58,440 --> 01:20:01,440
I don't want to sacrifice too much of my health for this

1737
01:20:01,440 --> 01:20:03,440
because the next few floors,

1738
01:20:03,440 --> 01:20:06,440
they do have cheeky enemies that take out your health quick

1739
01:20:06,440 --> 01:20:10,440
and I really don't want to go low.

1740
01:20:10,440 --> 01:20:17,440
But yeah, this is cheekily not the best.

1741
01:20:17,440 --> 01:20:20,440
We could definitely be doing better with just about everything.

1742
01:20:20,440 --> 01:20:25,440
Leave my dead body alone.

1743
01:20:25,440 --> 01:20:32,440
Yeah, this is a unique situation to be in.

1744
01:20:32,440 --> 01:20:38,440
Oh god, we've got flight now.

1745
01:20:38,440 --> 01:20:41,440
Okay, I can deal with flight.

1746
01:20:41,440 --> 01:20:43,440
But yeah, that's how lower damage is.

1747
01:20:43,440 --> 01:20:47,440
Just nothing is happening to Mohen.

1748
01:20:47,440 --> 01:20:50,440
Oh, well, I'm going to pop my ult.

1749
01:20:50,440 --> 01:20:52,440
Maybe the net cross is what's going to take her out.

1750
01:20:52,440 --> 01:20:54,440
The net cross effect.

1751
01:20:54,440 --> 01:20:56,440
I think it's 60 damage by default.

1752
01:20:56,440 --> 01:21:01,440
If you get page two, I think it increases to like 60.

1753
01:21:01,440 --> 01:21:05,440
I meant to say 30 if I said 60.

1754
01:21:05,440 --> 01:21:09,440
This is not going to go well.

1755
01:21:09,440 --> 01:21:12,440
I'm trying.

1756
01:21:12,440 --> 01:21:13,440
Come on, game.

1757
01:21:13,440 --> 01:21:15,440
You must realize my health is low.

1758
01:21:15,440 --> 01:21:20,440
You must know how terribly low my health is.

1759
01:21:20,440 --> 01:21:22,440
This is excruciating.

1760
01:21:22,440 --> 01:21:25,440
This is a crawl.

1761
01:21:25,440 --> 01:21:27,440
I don't know if I need a bomber.

1762
01:21:27,440 --> 01:21:29,440
You know that?

1763
01:21:29,440 --> 01:21:32,440
Okay.

1764
01:21:32,440 --> 01:21:33,440
Pardon me.

1765
01:21:33,440 --> 01:21:34,440
I'm sorry.

1766
01:21:34,440 --> 01:21:37,440
We did fail the devil deal, which is a shame.

1767
01:21:37,440 --> 01:21:41,440
We are going to have to take the damage, the negative.

1768
01:21:41,440 --> 01:21:44,440
So we're going to have to drop down below Satan.

1769
01:21:44,440 --> 01:21:46,440
Satan.

1770
01:21:46,440 --> 01:21:47,440
Bless you.

1771
01:21:47,440 --> 01:21:48,440
There's a cough.

1772
01:21:48,440 --> 01:21:49,440
Actually, hydration check.

1773
01:21:49,440 --> 01:21:58,440
I think I'm about to start coughing.

1774
01:21:58,440 --> 01:22:00,440
I love my boomer gamer veto words.

1775
01:22:00,440 --> 01:22:02,440
I'm not fucking boomer.

1776
01:22:02,440 --> 01:22:03,440
I'm not even.

1777
01:22:03,440 --> 01:22:06,440
I'm not even millennial.

1778
01:22:06,440 --> 01:22:07,440
Boomer.

1779
01:22:07,440 --> 01:22:12,440
I'll shove a boomer up your arse.

1780
01:22:12,440 --> 01:22:13,440
Okay.

1781
01:22:13,440 --> 01:22:16,440
We don't have anything else we can do on this floor.

1782
01:22:16,440 --> 01:22:22,440
We're going to take the Satanic Bible with us.

1783
01:22:22,440 --> 01:22:25,440
T-boy is pretty old mummy.

1784
01:22:25,440 --> 01:22:28,440
What the sigma?

1785
01:22:28,440 --> 01:22:31,440
Let's hope we can get a devil deal as well as a devil item on this floor.

1786
01:22:31,440 --> 01:22:38,440
Because that would make the world a difference if we got some of that good stuff.

1787
01:22:38,440 --> 01:22:41,440
I'm wondering if brimstone shot.

1788
01:22:41,440 --> 01:22:44,440
Oh, you're done.

1789
01:22:44,440 --> 01:22:50,440
Brimstone shot would still have the negation.

1790
01:22:50,440 --> 01:22:52,440
Like they can't hit us.

1791
01:22:52,440 --> 01:22:56,440
What's the fight room?

1792
01:22:56,440 --> 01:22:58,440
Tell you what.

1793
01:22:58,440 --> 01:23:00,440
Tell you what.

1794
01:23:00,440 --> 01:23:02,440
Let's just do that.

1795
01:23:02,440 --> 01:23:05,440
Zoomer, but somehow also not a weeb.

1796
01:23:05,440 --> 01:23:07,440
Well, we're watching anime together.

1797
01:23:07,440 --> 01:23:10,440
She better get recommended me the ones I need to see.

1798
01:23:10,440 --> 01:23:14,440
I've seen the ones that everyone's seen.

1799
01:23:14,440 --> 01:23:19,440
Like attack on titan, death note, kill or kill.

1800
01:23:19,440 --> 01:23:21,440
I've seen what needs to be seen.

1801
01:23:21,440 --> 01:23:25,440
So you guys can actually start recommending me animes.

1802
01:23:25,440 --> 01:23:27,440
And we'll do full binge anime days.

1803
01:23:27,440 --> 01:23:29,440
I think runescape.

1804
01:23:29,440 --> 01:23:36,440
We might do a binge because I got two more streams and then I've got my 99 on runescape.

1805
01:23:36,440 --> 01:23:40,440
So that's another goal met that I wanted.

1806
01:23:40,440 --> 01:23:45,440
And then we'll do weeb days.

1807
01:23:45,440 --> 01:23:50,440
And then I'll call it the weebification of strawnae.

1808
01:23:50,440 --> 01:23:56,440
I'm going to pop this just to make sure I've popped it.

1809
01:23:56,440 --> 01:23:59,440
That's a lot of enemies.

1810
01:23:59,440 --> 01:24:03,440
I'm trying to get the one in the corner so I can run somewhere if I need to.

1811
01:24:03,440 --> 01:24:06,440
But it's not really happening.

1812
01:24:06,440 --> 01:24:08,440
The enemies are so polite.

1813
01:24:08,440 --> 01:24:09,440
They just don't walk into me.

1814
01:24:09,440 --> 01:24:11,440
My favourite kind of enemy.

1815
01:24:11,440 --> 01:24:15,440
I'm watching dundum iron-blooded orphans.

1816
01:24:15,440 --> 01:24:16,440
It's pretty gay.

1817
01:24:16,440 --> 01:24:19,440
Cowboy beatbox.

1818
01:24:19,440 --> 01:24:24,440
I've seen samurai shampoo.

1819
01:24:24,440 --> 01:24:26,440
Is that really not a hit?

1820
01:24:26,440 --> 01:24:27,440
Oh!

1821
01:24:27,440 --> 01:24:29,440
Why did I not see the dam?

1822
01:24:29,440 --> 01:24:33,440
I did not see it coming at all.

1823
01:24:33,440 --> 01:24:36,440
It must be the confidence that you give me reeflings, honestly.

1824
01:24:36,440 --> 01:24:38,440
That's right, I'm turning this on you.

1825
01:24:38,440 --> 01:24:39,440
It's your problem.

1826
01:24:39,440 --> 01:24:40,440
It's your problem.

1827
01:24:40,440 --> 01:24:41,440
It's my problem.

1828
01:24:41,440 --> 01:24:43,440
Please item!

1829
01:24:43,440 --> 01:24:46,440
Receive triple shot.

1830
01:24:46,440 --> 01:24:47,440
Triple shot?

1831
01:24:47,440 --> 01:24:49,440
I mean, I guess.

1832
01:24:49,440 --> 01:24:52,440
We can use it if we're in a pinch.

1833
01:24:52,440 --> 01:25:00,440
See, flight for a room like this would be so helpful to avoiding attacks.

1834
01:25:00,440 --> 01:25:02,440
No confidence.

1835
01:25:02,440 --> 01:25:07,440
You give me all confidence.

1836
01:25:07,440 --> 01:25:10,440
Oh!

1837
01:25:10,440 --> 01:25:13,440
Okay, we can at least go in the curse room to check it out.

1838
01:25:13,440 --> 01:25:14,440
Let me get up.

1839
01:25:14,440 --> 01:25:16,440
Let him get up.

1840
01:25:16,440 --> 01:25:17,440
Oh, one more.

1841
01:25:17,440 --> 01:25:20,440
One more.

1842
01:25:20,440 --> 01:25:24,440
Some of these enemies do not want to be vanquished.

1843
01:25:24,440 --> 01:25:27,440
I'm so used to them coming flying at you.

1844
01:25:27,440 --> 01:25:28,440
Okay, we can pop this.

1845
01:25:28,440 --> 01:25:30,440
Maybe a guppy item?

1846
01:25:30,440 --> 01:25:31,440
Speed?

1847
01:25:31,440 --> 01:25:32,440
Sure.

1848
01:25:32,440 --> 01:25:37,440
Oh, guppers!

1849
01:25:37,440 --> 01:25:41,440
No.

1850
01:25:41,440 --> 01:25:44,440
The game really wants me to take it.

1851
01:25:44,440 --> 01:25:45,440
Oh my gosh.

1852
01:25:45,440 --> 01:25:48,440
Wait, you can get a library?

1853
01:25:48,440 --> 01:25:49,440
What?

1854
01:25:49,440 --> 01:25:53,440
I didn't know you could get a library in the room.

1855
01:25:53,440 --> 01:25:54,440
What?

1856
01:25:54,440 --> 01:25:58,440
Well, we've already got that.

1857
01:25:58,440 --> 01:26:00,440
I'll go at ten keys and no more.

1858
01:26:00,440 --> 01:26:04,440
I didn't know you could get a library down here.

1859
01:26:04,440 --> 01:26:05,440
Oh.

1860
01:26:05,440 --> 01:26:06,440
I'll take that.

1861
01:26:06,440 --> 01:26:07,440
I don't mind if I do.

1862
01:26:07,440 --> 01:26:08,440
A devil beggar.

1863
01:26:08,440 --> 01:26:09,440
Sure.

1864
01:26:09,440 --> 01:26:10,440
Boom.

1865
01:26:10,440 --> 01:26:14,440
Well, you can actually do something with the money.

1866
01:26:15,440 --> 01:26:21,440
I had no idea you could get it down here.

1867
01:26:21,440 --> 01:26:23,440
Do I have access to a shop?

1868
01:26:23,440 --> 01:26:24,440
Sure.

1869
01:26:24,440 --> 01:26:25,440
I'll take it.

1870
01:26:25,440 --> 01:26:26,440
Thanks.

1871
01:26:26,440 --> 01:26:27,440
Did you get 20-20?

1872
01:26:27,440 --> 01:26:30,440
Yeah, I got 20-20 bookworm.

1873
01:26:30,440 --> 01:26:32,440
Hey, hit him with it.

1874
01:26:32,440 --> 01:26:34,440
Hey, hit him with it.

1875
01:26:34,440 --> 01:26:35,440
Gobi.

1876
01:26:35,440 --> 01:26:36,440
Gobi.

1877
01:26:36,440 --> 01:26:37,440
I love it.

1878
01:26:37,440 --> 01:26:39,440
I love the jump animation.

1879
01:26:39,440 --> 01:26:41,440
It's so cute.

1880
01:26:41,440 --> 01:26:43,440
No, go away.

1881
01:26:43,440 --> 01:26:44,440
No, go away.

1882
01:26:44,440 --> 01:26:45,440
You stink.

1883
01:26:45,440 --> 01:26:46,440
Ow.

1884
01:26:46,440 --> 01:26:47,440
Okay.

1885
01:26:47,440 --> 01:26:50,440
Did I use the book on this floor?

1886
01:26:50,440 --> 01:26:52,440
I have now.

1887
01:26:52,440 --> 01:26:55,440
I've used it twice if I forgot the other time.

1888
01:26:55,440 --> 01:26:59,440
I don't like these guys.

1889
01:26:59,440 --> 01:27:04,440
I wish we got more pills dropped actually.

1890
01:27:04,440 --> 01:27:09,440
Now that I think about it, six luck but not getting pills dropped.

1891
01:27:09,440 --> 01:27:10,440
Hmm.

1892
01:27:10,440 --> 01:27:11,440
Curious game.

1893
01:27:11,440 --> 01:27:13,440
The game knew I picked Kane.

1894
01:27:13,440 --> 01:27:14,440
Hmm.

1895
01:27:14,440 --> 01:27:15,440
And I had Lucky Foot.

1896
01:27:15,440 --> 01:27:16,440
Hmm.

1897
01:27:16,440 --> 01:27:17,440
This game wants me to suffer.

1898
01:27:17,440 --> 01:27:18,440
Admit it.

1899
01:27:18,440 --> 01:27:20,440
You want me to be upset.

1900
01:27:20,440 --> 01:27:23,440
You want me to vanquish and cry.

1901
01:27:23,440 --> 01:27:29,440
So not only do we have contact lines, we actually have PapaFly which protects us from incoming

1902
01:27:29,440 --> 01:27:30,440
projectiles.

1903
01:27:30,440 --> 01:27:36,440
I get, yeah, literally I can just spray them down.

1904
01:27:36,440 --> 01:27:37,440
Feels good, man.

1905
01:27:37,440 --> 01:27:39,440
Okay, hold on.

1906
01:27:39,440 --> 01:27:40,440
Alright.

1907
01:27:40,440 --> 01:27:42,440
Doesn't mean I'm immune though.

1908
01:27:42,440 --> 01:27:45,440
Can I blow this up?

1909
01:27:45,440 --> 01:27:46,440
Yeah.

1910
01:27:46,440 --> 01:27:47,440
Sure.

1911
01:27:47,440 --> 01:27:50,440
I'm sure that would come in handy.

1912
01:27:50,440 --> 01:27:51,440
So what's down here then?

1913
01:27:51,440 --> 01:27:52,440
Just a random room.

1914
01:27:52,440 --> 01:27:53,440
Whoa.

1915
01:27:53,440 --> 01:27:56,440
Just a room to punish you if you got a bit curious.

1916
01:27:56,440 --> 01:27:57,440
That's all.

1917
01:27:57,440 --> 01:28:00,440
Oh, we got Back Saber.

1918
01:28:00,440 --> 01:28:02,440
Back Saber, proct.

1919
01:28:02,440 --> 01:28:03,440
That's right.

1920
01:28:03,440 --> 01:28:08,440
The word is proct for you noobs that have never played this game before.

1921
01:28:08,440 --> 01:28:11,440
It means the effect came into play.

1922
01:28:11,440 --> 01:28:13,440
It's okay if you're a noob though.

1923
01:28:13,440 --> 01:28:16,440
I'll look after you.

1924
01:28:16,440 --> 01:28:18,440
What the heck?

1925
01:28:18,440 --> 01:28:21,440
I rarely go against this boss.

1926
01:28:21,440 --> 01:28:23,440
Wow.

1927
01:28:23,440 --> 01:28:28,440
I rarely go against this boss.

1928
01:28:28,440 --> 01:28:40,440
They get...

1929
01:28:40,440 --> 01:28:41,440
Hold on.

1930
01:28:41,440 --> 01:28:44,440
I need to pop this.

1931
01:28:44,440 --> 01:28:47,440
I never go against this boss.

1932
01:28:47,440 --> 01:28:48,440
I hardly...

1933
01:28:48,440 --> 01:28:49,440
What?

1934
01:28:49,440 --> 01:28:52,440
It has a phase freaking worm too?

1935
01:28:52,440 --> 01:28:57,440
And of course it's not projectile base because that would be too easy.

1936
01:28:57,440 --> 01:28:58,440
Right.

1937
01:28:58,440 --> 01:28:59,440
Damage up.

1938
01:28:59,440 --> 01:29:01,440
Thank goodness.

1939
01:29:01,440 --> 01:29:02,440
Are you kidding me?

1940
01:29:02,440 --> 01:29:04,440
We got a Krampus fight.

1941
01:29:04,440 --> 01:29:09,440
Our damage is now seven so we're actually looking decent.

1942
01:29:09,440 --> 01:29:10,440
A Krampus fight.

1943
01:29:10,440 --> 01:29:14,440
At least give us Lump of Coal instead of his head.

1944
01:29:14,440 --> 01:29:16,440
At least...

1945
01:29:16,440 --> 01:29:21,440
I didn't realize he could spin in a wee circle like that.

1946
01:29:21,440 --> 01:29:24,440
I said Lump of Coal.

1947
01:29:24,440 --> 01:29:26,440
I can't believe that.

1948
01:29:26,440 --> 01:29:30,440
I wouldn't have gone any worse if I tried.

1949
01:29:30,440 --> 01:29:32,440
Lump of Coal.

1950
01:29:32,440 --> 01:29:35,440
And we got head.

1951
01:29:35,440 --> 01:29:40,440
Look, head's good for you but for me not really.

1952
01:29:40,440 --> 01:29:42,440
That's terrible.

1953
01:29:42,440 --> 01:29:43,440
That's awful.

1954
01:29:43,440 --> 01:29:46,440
The way it just rolls off my tongue as well.

1955
01:29:46,440 --> 01:29:48,440
That's terrible.

1956
01:29:48,440 --> 01:29:51,440
Oh, of course there's pinworms as well.

1957
01:29:51,440 --> 01:29:55,440
How could we forget?

1958
01:29:55,440 --> 01:29:58,440
Okay.

1959
01:29:58,440 --> 01:30:00,440
I have no idea.

1960
01:30:00,440 --> 01:30:02,440
Oh, then we've got an arcade.

1961
01:30:02,440 --> 01:30:05,440
Okay, we can utilize our monies.

1962
01:30:05,440 --> 01:30:07,440
Arcades don't need keys.

1963
01:30:07,440 --> 01:30:09,440
They need a single cent.

1964
01:30:09,440 --> 01:30:14,440
Hmm.

1965
01:30:14,440 --> 01:30:18,440
The arcade machine took a full health.

1966
01:30:18,440 --> 01:30:20,440
Not a wee one.

1967
01:30:20,440 --> 01:30:23,440
I was going to say we can maybe get IV back.

1968
01:30:23,440 --> 01:30:28,440
But if it's taken full, I don't think so.

1969
01:30:28,440 --> 01:30:30,440
Oh, please.

1970
01:30:30,440 --> 01:30:32,440
I think I can just mow them down.

1971
01:30:32,440 --> 01:30:34,440
I don't need to aim if it's a projectile.

1972
01:30:34,440 --> 01:30:39,440
That's a mimic chest but because we have Holy Manta we can grab it.

1973
01:30:39,440 --> 01:30:43,440
Yeah, this is a womb floor.

1974
01:30:43,440 --> 01:30:46,440
Ooh.

1975
01:30:46,440 --> 01:30:49,440
The classic womb room.

1976
01:30:49,440 --> 01:30:50,440
Give me that.

1977
01:30:50,440 --> 01:30:51,440
Right, popped all.

1978
01:30:51,440 --> 01:30:53,440
So we're 100% getting a devil deal.

1979
01:30:53,440 --> 01:30:55,440
Whoa, we beelined.

1980
01:30:55,440 --> 01:30:57,440
Oh, I hate this guy.

1981
01:30:57,440 --> 01:30:58,440
I hate this guy.

1982
01:30:58,440 --> 01:30:59,440
Please.

1983
01:30:59,440 --> 01:31:00,440
Please be nice.

1984
01:31:00,440 --> 01:31:01,440
Please.

1985
01:31:01,440 --> 01:31:02,440
Okay.

1986
01:31:02,440 --> 01:31:07,440
The enemy, the secret room can't be in that previous room.

1987
01:31:07,440 --> 01:31:09,440
Maybe here?

1988
01:31:09,440 --> 01:31:10,440
Yeah, okay.

1989
01:31:10,440 --> 01:31:12,440
That's the best we can do.

1990
01:31:12,440 --> 01:31:16,440
Increase our chances by popping his cloaks.

1991
01:31:16,440 --> 01:31:17,440
36%.

1992
01:31:17,440 --> 01:31:18,440
It's not the best.

1993
01:31:18,440 --> 01:31:19,440
He's alright.

1994
01:31:19,440 --> 01:31:22,440
But yeah, that's pretty much all we can do.

1995
01:31:22,440 --> 01:31:27,440
Women downwards always is full heart damage, dang.

1996
01:31:27,440 --> 01:31:30,440
What am I meant to do beneath our desk now?

1997
01:31:30,440 --> 01:31:32,440
You can lick my toes.

1998
01:31:32,440 --> 01:31:34,440
That's terrible.

1999
01:31:34,440 --> 01:31:37,440
That made no sense if no one was reading chat.

2000
01:31:37,440 --> 01:31:39,440
I apologize if that came out of nowhere.

2001
01:31:39,440 --> 01:31:43,440
It's because I didn't read the full message.

2002
01:31:43,440 --> 01:31:44,440
Okay.

2003
01:31:44,440 --> 01:31:46,440
Okay, come on.

2004
01:31:47,440 --> 01:31:51,440
Okay, we're going to commit and we're just going to spray down the center.

2005
01:31:51,440 --> 01:31:59,440
Because I think we'll, okay, unless she does that, unless she does that attack, then I'm

2006
01:31:59,440 --> 01:32:02,440
not sure we can out-shoot this.

2007
01:32:02,440 --> 01:32:04,440
Just take your time.

2008
01:32:04,440 --> 01:32:06,440
We can out-shoot that.

2009
01:32:06,440 --> 01:32:07,440
That's fine.

2010
01:32:07,440 --> 01:32:09,440
We have orbitals as well, which are also protecting us.

2011
01:32:09,440 --> 01:32:11,440
We have gone full defense this run.

2012
01:32:11,440 --> 01:32:15,440
Actually, now that I think about it, this is just full defense.

2013
01:32:15,440 --> 01:32:25,440
I need to remember to go down after this fight.

2014
01:32:25,440 --> 01:32:27,440
Can you reach over there?

2015
01:32:27,440 --> 01:32:29,440
Seriously.

2016
01:32:29,440 --> 01:32:33,440
I must remember to go down.

2017
01:32:33,440 --> 01:32:34,440
Come on.

2018
01:32:34,440 --> 01:32:36,440
Please don't start laser beaming.

2019
01:32:36,440 --> 01:32:39,440
That's when I can't keep up.

2020
01:32:39,440 --> 01:32:42,440
That's the very move I was actually talking about.

2021
01:32:42,440 --> 01:32:44,440
Funny you mentioned that.

2022
01:32:44,440 --> 01:32:46,440
That's actually the very one.

2023
01:32:46,440 --> 01:32:51,440
Okay, we failed the devil deal, which is a shame.

2024
01:32:51,440 --> 01:32:54,440
Let's just go down then, I guess.

2025
01:32:54,440 --> 01:32:56,440
Just cast Feet of the Lea.

2026
01:32:56,440 --> 01:32:57,440
There's plenty of things to look down there.

2027
01:32:57,440 --> 01:32:59,440
How much longer are you going to play for?

2028
01:32:59,440 --> 01:33:01,440
More meh.

2029
01:33:01,440 --> 01:33:02,440
Oh, wow.

2030
01:33:02,440 --> 01:33:04,440
This run's actually taken a lot longer.

2031
01:33:04,440 --> 01:33:07,440
I think we're only doing one run today and then I'm going to redirect into Sheepster.

2032
01:33:07,440 --> 01:33:10,440
Oh, there's an eyeball.

2033
01:33:10,440 --> 01:33:12,440
Okay, we're fine.

2034
01:33:12,440 --> 01:33:16,440
I don't know if Sheepster's is up yet.

2035
01:33:16,440 --> 01:33:20,440
Okay, we've got bombs.

2036
01:33:20,440 --> 01:33:22,440
I'll probably just read a few marshmallows after this.

2037
01:33:22,440 --> 01:33:26,440
I didn't realize how much of a yamper I am.

2038
01:33:26,440 --> 01:33:28,440
I do apologize again for anyone who...

2039
01:33:28,440 --> 01:33:29,440
Oh, I don't have flight.

2040
01:33:29,440 --> 01:33:31,440
For some reason I thought I had flight because he had flight.

2041
01:33:31,440 --> 01:33:33,440
Although that's not how the game works.

2042
01:33:33,440 --> 01:33:38,440
I would love it if I did that.

2043
01:33:38,440 --> 01:33:41,440
Pop and all to confirm that we're getting a devil deal item.

2044
01:33:41,440 --> 01:33:44,440
Sheepy has a collab so she seems later today.

2045
01:33:44,440 --> 01:33:46,440
Sheepy, are you dodging me?

2046
01:33:46,440 --> 01:33:47,440
I'm starting to think you're dodging me.

2047
01:33:47,440 --> 01:33:48,440
Smile.

2048
01:33:50,440 --> 01:33:53,440
Yes, for anyone that is listening in,

2049
01:33:53,440 --> 01:33:55,440
I will repeat myself in a few days' time,

2050
01:33:55,440 --> 01:33:57,440
so don't worry if you didn't hear it at first.

2051
01:33:57,440 --> 01:33:58,440
There's got...

2052
01:33:58,440 --> 01:34:00,440
Wait, is the enemy still in this room?

2053
01:34:00,440 --> 01:34:02,440
Oh my God, I thought that.

2054
01:34:02,440 --> 01:34:04,440
I was like, wait, are you still here?

2055
01:34:04,440 --> 01:34:06,440
Hello, is anyone here?

2056
01:34:06,440 --> 01:34:09,440
I can't do any membership streams

2057
01:34:09,440 --> 01:34:12,440
or ASMR streams for three weeks.

2058
01:34:12,440 --> 01:34:16,440
But I will always make it up to you

2059
01:34:16,440 --> 01:34:18,440
because you know what I'm like.

2060
01:34:18,440 --> 01:34:21,440
So all I can say is thank you for your patience

2061
01:34:21,440 --> 01:34:23,440
and waiting on me.

2062
01:34:25,440 --> 01:34:26,440
You're joking.

2063
01:34:29,440 --> 01:34:31,440
Fricking...

2064
01:34:33,440 --> 01:34:35,440
But my gen mates, you can find their links

2065
01:34:35,440 --> 01:34:37,440
in the description below.

2066
01:34:37,440 --> 01:34:39,440
They will be doing ASMRs,

2067
01:34:39,440 --> 01:34:42,440
though Mersi had a fantastic ASMR role play

2068
01:34:42,440 --> 01:34:45,440
if you want to check out the VOD where she went to.

2069
01:34:47,440 --> 01:34:48,440
That was really good.

2070
01:34:48,440 --> 01:34:50,440
I found it really good anyway.

2071
01:34:52,440 --> 01:34:55,440
Considering she knew to the ASMR side of things

2072
01:34:55,440 --> 01:34:57,440
and producing it side of things.

2073
01:34:59,440 --> 01:35:02,440
I mean, we can try and find the secret room,

2074
01:35:02,440 --> 01:35:04,440
but yeah.

2075
01:35:04,440 --> 01:35:06,440
I think we'll just go for it.

2076
01:35:08,440 --> 01:35:10,440
I'm going to pop the hanged man.

2077
01:35:10,440 --> 01:35:12,440
I'll see if I regret it, but...

2078
01:35:14,440 --> 01:35:16,440
Oh, and Holy Mantle's gone already.

2079
01:35:16,440 --> 01:35:17,440
Lovely.

2080
01:35:17,440 --> 01:35:19,440
I might just pop the thing so I have the Necro effect.

2081
01:35:21,440 --> 01:35:23,440
Please don't spin. I'll cry.

2082
01:35:25,440 --> 01:35:27,440
It's not too bad.

2083
01:35:27,440 --> 01:35:28,440
It's not too bad.

2084
01:35:28,440 --> 01:35:30,440
It could be worse.

2085
01:35:30,440 --> 01:35:32,440
It could be a heck of a lot worse.

2086
01:35:33,440 --> 01:35:37,440
I really hope we get a good item

2087
01:35:37,440 --> 01:35:39,440
in the treasure box.

2088
01:35:39,440 --> 01:35:41,440
Is it the dark room it's called?

2089
01:35:41,440 --> 01:35:44,440
Oh wow, the card didn't last.

2090
01:35:47,440 --> 01:35:50,440
Okay, we can just keep spraying

2091
01:35:50,440 --> 01:35:53,440
because we have the dodge on the things.

2092
01:35:53,440 --> 01:35:56,440
As just as he's going to keep spraying.

2093
01:35:56,440 --> 01:35:57,440
Do you mind?

2094
01:35:57,440 --> 01:36:00,440
Papa Fly is going so ham right now.

2095
01:36:01,440 --> 01:36:04,440
Well, that's what we didn't want, but that's what we got.

2096
01:36:04,440 --> 01:36:06,440
Okay, we got that. That's fine.

2097
01:36:15,440 --> 01:36:17,440
Oh, I just got hurt by something.

2098
01:36:17,440 --> 01:36:19,440
Something's... I have no idea.

2099
01:36:19,440 --> 01:36:22,440
I don't have a concept of what's happening.

2100
01:36:24,440 --> 01:36:25,440
Okay, lovely.

2101
01:36:25,440 --> 01:36:26,440
Please don't...

2102
01:36:26,440 --> 01:36:28,440
I swear if I die because I'm just trash,

2103
01:36:28,440 --> 01:36:30,440
I'm going to cry so much.

2104
01:36:31,440 --> 01:36:33,440
I literally have Holy Mantle.

2105
01:36:33,440 --> 01:36:35,440
Imagine dying with Holy Mantle.

2106
01:36:35,440 --> 01:36:37,440
I'm not even playing the loss.

2107
01:36:37,440 --> 01:36:39,440
Okay, don't do that again to me.

2108
01:36:39,440 --> 01:36:42,440
I suck and there's no charge things back there,

2109
01:36:42,440 --> 01:36:43,440
so I'm just going to...

2110
01:36:43,440 --> 01:36:45,440
Mercy went all out in the stream.

2111
01:36:45,440 --> 01:36:47,440
It was good. It was really good.

2112
01:36:47,440 --> 01:36:49,440
Honestly, you're scary when you say that you will make up

2113
01:36:49,440 --> 01:36:50,440
for it last time.

2114
01:36:50,440 --> 01:36:51,440
You did four streams back to back.

2115
01:36:51,440 --> 01:36:52,440
What will happen?

2116
01:36:52,440 --> 01:36:53,440
Please take care.

2117
01:36:53,440 --> 01:36:54,440
Oh, you already know what's going to happen.

2118
01:36:54,440 --> 01:36:56,440
It's going to be like multiple membership streams,

2119
01:36:56,440 --> 01:36:58,440
multiple public streams on the same day.

2120
01:36:59,440 --> 01:37:01,440
Or endurance streams back to back.

2121
01:37:02,440 --> 01:37:04,440
Nope, don't need money.

2122
01:37:05,440 --> 01:37:08,440
Taking damage spawns a permanent demon.

2123
01:37:08,440 --> 01:37:11,440
Oh, of course I don't get to see my health either

2124
01:37:11,440 --> 01:37:12,440
because that would be too nice.

2125
01:37:12,440 --> 01:37:14,440
I'm going to take flies.

2126
01:37:14,440 --> 01:37:15,440
I like flies.

2127
01:37:15,440 --> 01:37:17,440
I'm just going to grab these. Why not?

2128
01:37:18,440 --> 01:37:20,440
We have Holy Mantle.

2129
01:37:20,440 --> 01:37:22,440
So we can what? Come in and out.

2130
01:37:23,440 --> 01:37:24,440
Holy moly.

2131
01:37:24,440 --> 01:37:25,440
I love Holy Mantle.

2132
01:37:25,440 --> 01:37:27,440
Enter in a room poisons all enemies.

2133
01:37:27,440 --> 01:37:29,440
Yes, that's a good one.

2134
01:37:31,440 --> 01:37:32,440
We got egg as well.

2135
01:37:32,440 --> 01:37:36,440
So we get soul heart and we can negate 20% damage.

2136
01:37:36,440 --> 01:37:39,440
That was a really good room to get all things considered.

2137
01:37:39,440 --> 01:37:41,440
I hate these guys.

2138
01:37:42,440 --> 01:37:43,440
They're terrible.

2139
01:37:46,440 --> 01:37:47,440
He's super scary.

2140
01:37:47,440 --> 01:37:48,440
He just got me.

2141
01:37:49,440 --> 01:37:50,440
Sorry, hold on.

2142
01:37:50,440 --> 01:37:52,440
My fingers falling off the analog stick.

2143
01:37:53,440 --> 01:37:54,440
He's so scary.

2144
01:37:54,440 --> 01:37:55,440
I hate him.

2145
01:37:56,440 --> 01:37:57,440
The wee mask guy.

2146
01:37:57,440 --> 01:37:58,440
Come on, blue baby.

2147
01:37:58,440 --> 01:38:00,440
Beat him up with your wee flies.

2148
01:38:00,440 --> 01:38:01,440
Oh no, you're not blue baby.

2149
01:38:01,440 --> 01:38:02,440
Sorry, zombie baby.

2150
01:38:02,440 --> 01:38:03,440
Dead baby.

2151
01:38:03,440 --> 01:38:04,440
Rotten baby.

2152
01:38:04,440 --> 01:38:05,440
Rotten baby.

2153
01:38:05,440 --> 01:38:06,440
I forgot his name.

2154
01:38:06,440 --> 01:38:07,440
An egg.

2155
01:38:07,440 --> 01:38:08,440
It's literally an egg.

2156
01:38:08,440 --> 01:38:09,440
Look at my head.

2157
01:38:09,440 --> 01:38:10,440
I'm an egg now.

2158
01:38:10,440 --> 01:38:11,440
I literally have an egg head.

2159
01:38:11,440 --> 01:38:12,440
Who you calling an egg head?

2160
01:38:13,440 --> 01:38:14,440
Look at my head.

2161
01:38:14,440 --> 01:38:15,440
It's an egg.

2162
01:38:17,440 --> 01:38:18,440
Secret floor.

2163
01:38:18,440 --> 01:38:19,440
Secret room, sorry.

2164
01:38:19,440 --> 01:38:21,440
And it's not a pill room.

2165
01:38:21,440 --> 01:38:24,440
I can't believe I'm actually asking the game to give me a pill room.

2166
01:38:25,440 --> 01:38:26,440
That's when you know it's bad.

2167
01:38:28,440 --> 01:38:29,440
Relax.

2168
01:38:30,440 --> 01:38:31,440
Okay.

2169
01:38:31,440 --> 01:38:32,440
Well, I deserve that.

2170
01:38:33,440 --> 01:38:34,440
Are you?

2171
01:38:34,440 --> 01:38:37,440
I'm actually going to die at the end of this game.

2172
01:38:39,440 --> 01:38:40,440
Please.

2173
01:38:43,440 --> 01:38:44,440
Please.

2174
01:38:45,440 --> 01:38:46,440
Okay, that was lucky.

2175
01:38:46,440 --> 01:38:47,440
What do you?

2176
01:38:47,440 --> 01:38:50,440
Oh no, he has the brimstone aim.

2177
01:38:50,440 --> 01:38:52,440
He has brimstone aim.

2178
01:38:53,440 --> 01:38:55,440
Like all lock things, my Bobber.

2179
01:38:56,440 --> 01:38:57,440
And he's going to do it.

2180
01:38:57,440 --> 01:38:58,440
I don't know when he's going to do it.

2181
01:38:58,440 --> 01:39:00,440
Okay, he's giving me spiders.

2182
01:39:00,440 --> 01:39:01,440
Yeah, he just did it there.

2183
01:39:01,440 --> 01:39:03,440
Did you see that purple charge beam?

2184
01:39:03,440 --> 01:39:06,440
I was on a you, you, you mop bag, honestly.

2185
01:39:06,440 --> 01:39:07,440
I saw that coming.

2186
01:39:08,440 --> 01:39:10,440
If we could raise our base damage,

2187
01:39:10,440 --> 01:39:12,440
we could raise our base damage.

2188
01:39:12,440 --> 01:39:14,440
We could raise our base damage.

2189
01:39:14,440 --> 01:39:16,440
We could raise our base damage.

2190
01:39:18,440 --> 01:39:20,440
We do have 6% luck.

2191
01:39:20,440 --> 01:39:23,440
Honestly, we should probably be getting a bit.

2192
01:39:23,440 --> 01:39:24,440
Did I?

2193
01:39:24,440 --> 01:39:25,440
I just.

2194
01:39:27,440 --> 01:39:28,440
Hold on a minute.

2195
01:39:33,440 --> 01:39:34,440
Wow.

2196
01:39:36,440 --> 01:39:38,440
Who are you calling a pin today?

2197
01:39:39,440 --> 01:39:43,440
What did, did you guys know that match is the secret voice actor of Patrick star?

2198
01:39:43,440 --> 01:39:45,440
Who are you calling a pin?

2199
01:39:46,440 --> 01:39:47,440
Right.

2200
01:39:47,440 --> 01:39:50,440
I'm going to pop my alt because I've no got a scooby-doo what my health is,

2201
01:39:50,440 --> 01:39:52,440
but he needs when he needs.

2202
01:39:52,440 --> 01:39:53,440
Right.

2203
01:39:53,440 --> 01:39:57,440
The fear is actually helping to take enemies off of her bat.

2204
01:39:57,440 --> 01:39:59,440
Oh, this is a terrible room.

2205
01:40:00,440 --> 01:40:01,440
No.

2206
01:40:03,440 --> 01:40:06,440
No, that's what I didn't want.

2207
01:40:06,440 --> 01:40:08,440
How am I supposed to negate that?

2208
01:40:08,440 --> 01:40:09,440
I don't know.

2209
01:40:10,440 --> 01:40:12,440
He's curving.

2210
01:40:12,440 --> 01:40:14,440
He's not straight.

2211
01:40:14,440 --> 01:40:15,440
He's curving.

2212
01:40:15,440 --> 01:40:17,440
Why is it curved?

2213
01:40:19,440 --> 01:40:20,440
You got me.

2214
01:40:20,440 --> 01:40:21,440
Okay.

2215
01:40:21,440 --> 01:40:22,440
Hold on.

2216
01:40:22,440 --> 01:40:23,440
I'm just walloping them.

2217
01:40:23,440 --> 01:40:24,440
Okay.

2218
01:40:26,440 --> 01:40:29,440
I don't know if this boss fight is going to go well.

2219
01:40:29,440 --> 01:40:32,440
I'm going to keep all my bombs for the boss fight because I don't trust this.

2220
01:40:34,440 --> 01:40:35,440
He's by the pope.

2221
01:40:36,440 --> 01:40:38,440
Donating cause I'm sad.

2222
01:40:38,440 --> 01:40:39,440
I can't watch.

2223
01:40:39,440 --> 01:40:40,440
Just listen.

2224
01:40:40,440 --> 01:40:42,440
You'd only hear me right now.

2225
01:40:42,440 --> 01:40:44,440
Are you at work?

2226
01:40:44,440 --> 01:40:46,440
Don't make me start.

2227
01:40:46,440 --> 01:40:48,440
Thank you, Broly legend for the tip.

2228
01:40:48,440 --> 01:40:50,440
Patrick is a neat and still makes ends meet every month.

2229
01:40:50,440 --> 01:40:53,440
Wait, you keep people actually say ain't got a scooby-doo.

2230
01:40:53,440 --> 01:40:54,440
That wasn't a sigh up.

2231
01:40:54,440 --> 01:40:55,440
No, we say that.

2232
01:40:55,440 --> 01:40:56,440
I've not got a clue.

2233
01:40:56,440 --> 01:41:00,440
I ain't got a scooby-doo because scooby-doo are always looking for a clue.

2234
01:41:01,440 --> 01:41:02,440
I've not got a scooby-doo.

2235
01:41:02,440 --> 01:41:03,440
What's going on?

2236
01:41:03,440 --> 01:41:04,440
I've not got a clue.

2237
01:41:05,440 --> 01:41:06,440
It's not a sigh up.

2238
01:41:06,440 --> 01:41:07,440
It's real.

2239
01:41:07,440 --> 01:41:09,440
I promise you British people are real.

2240
01:41:09,440 --> 01:41:11,440
I'm sorry you had to learn this way.

2241
01:41:14,440 --> 01:41:15,440
That's a good something.

2242
01:41:20,440 --> 01:41:21,440
Oh no.

2243
01:41:23,440 --> 01:41:25,440
I may have just killed us.

2244
01:41:27,440 --> 01:41:29,440
I may have just killed us.

2245
01:41:30,440 --> 01:41:32,440
I may have just killed us run dead in the water.

2246
01:41:34,440 --> 01:41:35,440
Oh yeah, piggy bank.

2247
01:41:35,440 --> 01:41:36,440
That'll sure help.

2248
01:41:36,440 --> 01:41:37,440
Yeah, thanks piggy bank.

2249
01:41:37,440 --> 01:41:38,440
Yeah, thanks.

2250
01:41:43,440 --> 01:41:48,440
I accidentally picked up a quarter which has no value at all in this run.

2251
01:41:48,440 --> 01:41:52,440
When I desperately need health and I keep messing up.

2252
01:41:54,440 --> 01:41:57,440
If I could just mow him down before he mows me down.

2253
01:42:01,440 --> 01:42:02,440
I can't tell if that...

2254
01:42:02,440 --> 01:42:08,440
So sometimes the game puts down bombs to give you a hint that the secret room's there.

2255
01:42:08,440 --> 01:42:11,440
But obviously you can't, you always believe it.

2256
01:42:11,440 --> 01:42:14,440
Okay, that was lucky that Toxic Shot came in clutch.

2257
01:42:15,440 --> 01:42:20,440
So again, we're going to try and mow him down and make him scared because his attack is insane.

2258
01:42:20,440 --> 01:42:21,440
I do not like his attack.

2259
01:42:23,440 --> 01:42:25,440
Okay, that was lucky.

2260
01:42:26,440 --> 01:42:27,440
This is not lucky.

2261
01:42:28,440 --> 01:42:30,440
That's not lucky at all.

2262
01:42:32,440 --> 01:42:34,440
I really would like...

2263
01:42:36,440 --> 01:42:39,440
I would really like a chance to survive, please.

2264
01:42:39,440 --> 01:42:40,440
I really don't want to lose right at the end.

2265
01:42:40,440 --> 01:42:42,440
I'm going to be so sad.

2266
01:42:42,440 --> 01:42:43,440
There was a guy there.

2267
01:42:43,440 --> 01:42:44,440
I didn't realize he was there.

2268
01:42:47,440 --> 01:42:53,440
Toxic Shock is definitely helping do some damage, which I'm glad because we don't have a lot.

2269
01:42:55,440 --> 01:42:59,440
Damage and taking damage, taking damage shoots away to assure.

2270
01:43:00,440 --> 01:43:01,440
See, I...

2271
01:43:02,440 --> 01:43:03,440
That was four.

2272
01:43:04,440 --> 01:43:08,440
I'm kind of stranded because my car broke down and my phone's almost there.

2273
01:43:08,440 --> 01:43:09,440
That's like...

2274
01:43:11,440 --> 01:43:12,440
Are you called...

2275
01:43:13,440 --> 01:43:14,440
Are you called a mechanic or whatever?

2276
01:43:14,440 --> 01:43:15,440
Nah, I believe you.

2277
01:43:15,440 --> 01:43:16,440
You can win this easily.

2278
01:43:16,440 --> 01:43:17,440
Wait, they're real.

2279
01:43:17,440 --> 01:43:18,440
I thought it was just a joke.

2280
01:43:18,440 --> 01:43:22,440
You only lost one red heart, but I don't have any red hearts now.

2281
01:43:23,440 --> 01:43:24,440
Are you scared?

2282
01:43:24,440 --> 01:43:27,440
It means I have very low soul hearts.

2283
01:43:28,440 --> 01:43:32,440
Because we had four red hearts, so we're now missing four hearts.

2284
01:43:32,440 --> 01:43:34,440
And I'm taking damage in every room.

2285
01:43:35,440 --> 01:43:36,440
Like a dum-dum.

2286
01:43:40,440 --> 01:43:41,440
Okay.

2287
01:43:46,440 --> 01:43:48,440
Were we just saved?

2288
01:43:49,440 --> 01:43:50,440
Oh.

2289
01:43:52,440 --> 01:43:55,440
Turns all troll bombs into safety ones.

2290
01:43:55,440 --> 01:43:57,440
Well, I'd rather take the safety ones.

2291
01:43:57,440 --> 01:44:00,440
Did we just get saved by Cricket's Head?

2292
01:44:00,440 --> 01:44:02,440
I think we did.

2293
01:44:05,440 --> 01:44:07,440
I think we just got saved by Cricket's Head.

2294
01:44:07,440 --> 01:44:08,440
I'm not even kidding.

2295
01:44:08,440 --> 01:44:09,440
I'm gonna pop this instantly.

2296
01:44:12,440 --> 01:44:13,440
Okay.

2297
01:44:14,440 --> 01:44:16,440
I think we just got saved by Cricket's Head.

2298
01:44:16,440 --> 01:44:18,440
Holy moly.

2299
01:44:18,440 --> 01:44:21,440
I'm gonna just spam my wee bombs.

2300
01:44:22,440 --> 01:44:25,440
Now the purple might wrap around.

2301
01:44:25,440 --> 01:44:28,440
Okay, we're gonna spam the bombs.

2302
01:44:29,440 --> 01:44:30,440
Whoa.

2303
01:44:30,440 --> 01:44:32,440
Okay, see, that's what I didn't like.

2304
01:44:34,440 --> 01:44:36,440
I'm just gonna spam bombs.

2305
01:44:37,440 --> 01:44:40,440
There's nothing wrong with the bur-bur-bur spamming.

2306
01:44:40,440 --> 01:44:41,440
None wrong with spamming the bombs.

2307
01:44:41,440 --> 01:44:42,440
Okay, we actually did it.

2308
01:44:43,440 --> 01:44:44,440
Sure.

2309
01:44:44,440 --> 01:44:45,440
Let's do a victory lap.

2310
01:44:47,440 --> 01:44:49,440
The lamb can't kill you with shielded tears, mommy.

2311
01:44:49,440 --> 01:44:51,440
I don't believe in myself.

2312
01:44:51,440 --> 01:44:53,440
Okay, seller one.

2313
01:44:53,440 --> 01:44:57,440
Right, we are just gonna do one run.

2314
01:44:57,440 --> 01:44:59,440
Oh my god, we're so strong.

2315
01:45:00,440 --> 01:45:02,440
Okay, now we can be picky and choosy.

2316
01:45:02,440 --> 01:45:04,440
Continuum, absolutely.

2317
01:45:04,440 --> 01:45:05,440
I love continuum.

2318
01:45:05,440 --> 01:45:06,440
Very good.

2319
01:45:06,440 --> 01:45:08,440
We now actually have range.

2320
01:45:08,440 --> 01:45:09,440
Let's go.

2321
01:45:10,440 --> 01:45:11,440
Adult and adult?

2322
01:45:11,440 --> 01:45:12,440
No.

2323
01:45:12,440 --> 01:45:13,440
I don't wanna take these.

2324
01:45:14,440 --> 01:45:15,440
Yucky.

2325
01:45:15,440 --> 01:45:16,440
Stinky.

2326
01:45:16,440 --> 01:45:20,440
Right, so we're doing what's called a victory lap,

2327
01:45:20,440 --> 01:45:22,440
which means you basically get to go again

2328
01:45:22,440 --> 01:45:24,440
and keep all your items,

2329
01:45:24,440 --> 01:45:27,440
which is pretty cool.

2330
01:45:27,440 --> 01:45:28,440
So we might get a chance to get-

2331
01:45:28,440 --> 01:45:29,440
Oh, we got BFF.

2332
01:45:29,440 --> 01:45:30,440
I forgot about that.

2333
01:45:30,440 --> 01:45:32,440
Okay, we're gonna go to the room.

2334
01:45:34,440 --> 01:45:35,440
And we're gonna grab this.

2335
01:45:35,440 --> 01:45:37,440
Spectral tears and flight.

2336
01:45:37,440 --> 01:45:38,440
Yep, we're gonna grab it.

2337
01:45:39,440 --> 01:45:42,440
So this is where things get super OP

2338
01:45:42,440 --> 01:45:45,440
and things get super duper easy.

2339
01:45:46,440 --> 01:45:49,440
Which is exactly why I like this.

2340
01:45:49,440 --> 01:45:50,440
I'm gonna take BFF.

2341
01:45:51,440 --> 01:45:52,440
We'll take Buddy in a box.

2342
01:45:52,440 --> 01:45:53,440
Why not?

2343
01:45:53,440 --> 01:45:55,440
We'll try and get the conjoined transformation.

2344
01:45:56,440 --> 01:45:58,440
If you get Mum's pills, why not?

2345
01:46:01,440 --> 01:46:02,440
Range up.

2346
01:46:03,440 --> 01:46:04,440
Health up.

2347
01:46:06,440 --> 01:46:07,440
Balls of steel,

2348
01:46:07,440 --> 01:46:10,440
which gives you two soul hearts and power pill.

2349
01:46:11,440 --> 01:46:14,440
But yeah, this is the cool part about Isaac.

2350
01:46:15,440 --> 01:46:17,440
It means more time with moment, yeah.

2351
01:46:17,440 --> 01:46:18,440
We're gonna do this.

2352
01:46:18,440 --> 01:46:21,440
Now, normally you could just obliterate through it.

2353
01:46:21,440 --> 01:46:22,440
Sadly.

2354
01:46:26,440 --> 01:46:27,440
Wait, what's going on?

2355
01:46:31,440 --> 01:46:32,440
Oh, whoops.

2356
01:46:32,440 --> 01:46:34,440
He wasn't taking-

2357
01:46:34,440 --> 01:46:37,440
He wasn't taking the health I thought he was taking.

2358
01:46:37,440 --> 01:46:39,440
You didn't see that, okay?

2359
01:46:39,440 --> 01:46:40,440
You didn't see that.

2360
01:46:42,440 --> 01:46:43,440
You didn't see that.

2361
01:46:43,440 --> 01:46:44,440
That was rather embarrassing.

2362
01:46:44,440 --> 01:46:46,440
I wasn't paying attention, okay?

2363
01:46:46,440 --> 01:46:47,440
I wasn't paying attention.

2364
01:46:48,440 --> 01:46:50,440
We could grab the heart in here.

2365
01:46:51,440 --> 01:46:52,440
Fill damage, yeah.

2366
01:46:55,440 --> 01:46:56,440
Whoopsies.

2367
01:46:56,440 --> 01:46:57,440
I wasn't paying attention.

2368
01:46:57,440 --> 01:46:59,440
Thank goodness we're OP.

2369
01:47:01,440 --> 01:47:02,440
Oh, health up.

2370
01:47:03,440 --> 01:47:04,440
Oh well.

2371
01:47:04,440 --> 01:47:06,440
Maybe we can get a-

2372
01:47:07,440 --> 01:47:09,440
Oh, look at that continuum already.

2373
01:47:09,440 --> 01:47:11,440
Looking spectacular.

2374
01:47:13,440 --> 01:47:15,440
Don't mind the fuzz, please.

2375
01:47:15,440 --> 01:47:16,440
Can I get an item?

2376
01:47:18,440 --> 01:47:19,440
Come on.

2377
01:47:20,440 --> 01:47:22,440
Give it to me, Rachel.

2378
01:47:22,440 --> 01:47:23,440
Show it to me, please.

2379
01:47:25,440 --> 01:47:28,440
Yeah, this is why I adore-

2380
01:47:31,440 --> 01:47:32,440
What was it?

2381
01:47:32,440 --> 01:47:33,440
Radiation?

2382
01:47:33,440 --> 01:47:34,440
Toxic shock?

2383
01:47:34,440 --> 01:47:35,440
It's just so good.

2384
01:47:35,440 --> 01:47:36,440
Come on, give us-

2385
01:47:36,440 --> 01:47:37,440
No.

2386
01:47:37,440 --> 01:47:38,440
Flight for the room.

2387
01:47:38,440 --> 01:47:39,440
We've already got flight.

2388
01:47:39,440 --> 01:47:40,440
Mommy's throwing!

2389
01:47:40,440 --> 01:47:41,440
No, I'm too OP.

2390
01:47:41,440 --> 01:47:43,440
I need to level the plane field, okay?

2391
01:47:44,440 --> 01:47:45,440
But yeah, look at that.

2392
01:47:45,440 --> 01:47:46,440
Oh, so satisfying.

2393
01:47:47,440 --> 01:47:49,440
Did you know that if you don't attack,

2394
01:47:49,440 --> 01:47:51,440
we fly then it'll buzz away

2395
01:47:51,440 --> 01:47:53,440
and you'll get an item on lock?

2396
01:47:53,440 --> 01:47:55,440
Leviathan, speed and damage.

2397
01:47:55,440 --> 01:47:57,440
Like, this is what we're talking about.

2398
01:47:57,440 --> 01:47:59,440
14.37.

2399
01:48:00,440 --> 01:48:01,440
Damage.

2400
01:48:02,440 --> 01:48:03,440
We'll go next.

2401
01:48:07,440 --> 01:48:09,440
I like Super Meat Boy when he's fully transformed.

2402
01:48:09,440 --> 01:48:10,440
It's so good.

2403
01:48:10,440 --> 01:48:11,440
Do your best, mommy.

2404
01:48:11,440 --> 01:48:12,440
I will!

2405
01:48:13,440 --> 01:48:16,440
And we're gonna do so MLG in this game.

2406
01:48:17,440 --> 01:48:18,440
Okay.

2407
01:48:18,440 --> 01:48:19,440
Again, a room with nothing.

2408
01:48:19,440 --> 01:48:20,440
Oh wait, we can go in here.

2409
01:48:21,440 --> 01:48:22,440
Okay, let's see.

2410
01:48:22,440 --> 01:48:23,440
Can we get so hard?

2411
01:48:24,440 --> 01:48:25,440
Stompy.

2412
01:48:25,440 --> 01:48:26,440
So hard.

2413
01:48:26,440 --> 01:48:27,440
Balls of steel.

2414
01:48:28,440 --> 01:48:30,440
And we've got El Diablo.

2415
01:48:31,440 --> 01:48:33,440
Oh, it's so satisfying

2416
01:48:33,440 --> 01:48:35,440
when you do a frickin' victory lap.

2417
01:48:35,440 --> 01:48:36,440
I'm so sorry.

2418
01:48:36,440 --> 01:48:38,440
If you're ever bored of Isaac,

2419
01:48:38,440 --> 01:48:39,440
do a victory lap.

2420
01:48:39,440 --> 01:48:41,440
It's just like, oh, that's right.

2421
01:48:41,440 --> 01:48:42,440
I'm mowing you all down

2422
01:48:42,440 --> 01:48:44,440
and there's nothing you can do about it.

2423
01:48:44,440 --> 01:48:45,440
Take it.

2424
01:48:48,440 --> 01:48:50,440
Whoa, we got C-section?

2425
01:48:50,440 --> 01:48:51,440
Hold on.

2426
01:48:55,440 --> 01:48:59,440
Oh my gosh, the babies are cute.

2427
01:49:00,440 --> 01:49:02,440
Look at the electricity coming from them.

2428
01:49:02,440 --> 01:49:05,440
C-section is like an insane amount of damage.

2429
01:49:06,440 --> 01:49:08,440
And they have homing.

2430
01:49:10,440 --> 01:49:11,440
That's right.

2431
01:49:11,440 --> 01:49:13,440
The babies will home to you.

2432
01:49:14,440 --> 01:49:16,440
Nah, you just need a tears up.

2433
01:49:16,440 --> 01:49:18,440
Birth rate?

2434
01:49:18,440 --> 01:49:20,440
All future floors will contain

2435
01:49:20,440 --> 01:49:22,440
an upgraded arcade room.

2436
01:49:26,440 --> 01:49:27,440
What?

2437
01:49:28,440 --> 01:49:29,440
That's so cool.

2438
01:49:31,440 --> 01:49:32,440
What's that?

2439
01:49:32,440 --> 01:49:33,440
Full health.

2440
01:49:33,440 --> 01:49:34,440
Full health.

2441
01:49:36,440 --> 01:49:38,440
I'm not going to spend my money

2442
01:49:38,440 --> 01:49:40,440
because I've been spending another shot.

2443
01:49:41,440 --> 01:49:44,440
Oh, toxic shot just took over there.

2444
01:49:45,440 --> 01:49:47,440
Right, that was a shot, wasn't it?

2445
01:49:47,440 --> 01:49:49,440
Unfortunately, we do have...

2446
01:49:49,440 --> 01:49:50,440
Oh, that's a sticky penny.

2447
01:49:50,440 --> 01:49:52,440
You can't pick it up.

2448
01:49:52,440 --> 01:49:56,440
Unfortunately, we do have the curse...

2449
01:49:56,440 --> 01:49:57,440
What curse is it?

2450
01:49:57,440 --> 01:49:59,440
The no mapping curse.

2451
01:49:59,440 --> 01:50:00,440
But I think I know where I'm going.

2452
01:50:00,440 --> 01:50:02,440
I think I trust myself.

2453
01:50:02,440 --> 01:50:03,440
Let me grab this.

2454
01:50:04,440 --> 01:50:05,440
But look.

2455
01:50:05,440 --> 01:50:07,440
Looky, looky.

2456
01:50:07,440 --> 01:50:09,440
All done.

2457
01:50:09,440 --> 01:50:11,440
Sure, we've got conjoined.

2458
01:50:12,440 --> 01:50:13,440
Yay!

2459
01:50:15,440 --> 01:50:18,440
Shoot normal tier 7 pair of damage.

2460
01:50:19,440 --> 01:50:21,440
I mean...

2461
01:50:21,440 --> 01:50:23,440
Did we just take him?

2462
01:50:23,440 --> 01:50:25,440
I feel like we replenish our health so quickly.

2463
01:50:25,440 --> 01:50:27,440
There's no point in like skipping.

2464
01:50:29,440 --> 01:50:31,440
I feel like I'm feeling it.

2465
01:50:32,440 --> 01:50:33,440
Okay.

2466
01:50:33,440 --> 01:50:35,440
C-Section and Shield of Tears is dumb

2467
01:50:35,440 --> 01:50:37,440
because they keep firing homing Shield of Tears.

2468
01:50:37,440 --> 01:50:40,440
Never seen that item after 200 hours of this game.

2469
01:50:40,440 --> 01:50:41,440
What one?

2470
01:50:41,440 --> 01:50:44,440
Oh, your profile picture is my eyeball.

2471
01:50:44,440 --> 01:50:46,440
I recognize my own eyeball anywhere.

2472
01:50:46,440 --> 01:50:48,440
Don't forget to use your item.

2473
01:50:49,440 --> 01:50:50,440
Yes.

2474
01:50:50,440 --> 01:50:52,440
I popped that mouth like bang.

2475
01:50:53,440 --> 01:50:55,440
I gave it that hook too.

2476
01:50:56,440 --> 01:50:57,440
Okay.

2477
01:51:00,440 --> 01:51:04,440
Look how big my little guys are.

2478
01:51:06,440 --> 01:51:07,440
They're so big.

2479
01:51:07,440 --> 01:51:08,440
No.

2480
01:51:13,440 --> 01:51:14,440
I'm just...

2481
01:51:14,440 --> 01:51:17,440
We could honestly just speed it to the fight again.

2482
01:51:18,440 --> 01:51:20,440
I like taking my time, you know?

2483
01:51:20,440 --> 01:51:22,440
It's not all about a race.

2484
01:51:23,440 --> 01:51:25,440
Sometimes it's about the drone.

2485
01:51:25,440 --> 01:51:27,440
And now I'm mad I dropped that trinket

2486
01:51:27,440 --> 01:51:30,440
because it didn't occur to me I could do a victory lap.

2487
01:51:30,440 --> 01:51:32,440
But it was the best thing to do at the time.

2488
01:51:40,440 --> 01:51:44,440
So we just accidentally skipped an entire floor.

2489
01:51:44,440 --> 01:51:50,440
Telepills has a chance to take you to the error room.

2490
01:51:50,440 --> 01:51:54,440
Which is what I managed to do successfully.

2491
01:51:56,440 --> 01:51:59,440
I don't know why that one broke my mantle,

2492
01:51:59,440 --> 01:52:00,440
but the other ones didn't.

2493
01:52:03,440 --> 01:52:04,440
Oh well.

2494
01:52:06,440 --> 01:52:07,440
That's unfortunate.

2495
01:52:09,440 --> 01:52:11,440
I did not expect a...

2496
01:52:11,440 --> 01:52:13,440
I am error room from that.

2497
01:52:13,440 --> 01:52:16,440
Well, we might get a planetarium.

2498
01:52:16,440 --> 01:52:17,440
You know what?

2499
01:52:17,440 --> 01:52:18,440
We might get a planetarium.

2500
01:52:19,440 --> 01:52:21,440
Spawn's a devil beggar, sure.

2501
01:52:24,440 --> 01:52:25,440
I don't have health.

2502
01:52:27,440 --> 01:52:30,440
You're asking the wrong Isaac player for health right now.

2503
01:52:30,440 --> 01:52:31,440
I'm gonna pop my ult.

2504
01:52:33,440 --> 01:52:35,440
Now we do have...

2505
01:52:38,440 --> 01:52:40,440
We got fun guys.

2506
01:52:40,440 --> 01:52:43,440
So I get a size down and I get range and speed up.

2507
01:52:43,440 --> 01:52:45,440
So my hitbox is like smaller.

2508
01:52:45,440 --> 01:52:46,440
My...

2509
01:52:46,440 --> 01:52:48,440
My followers are bigger than me.

2510
01:52:48,440 --> 01:52:49,440
My little...

2511
01:52:49,440 --> 01:52:51,440
Familiar, it's not follower, sorry.

2512
01:52:51,440 --> 01:52:54,440
Are literally bigger than me in the game.

2513
01:52:54,440 --> 01:52:57,440
I love being tiny, it's so cute.

2514
01:53:00,440 --> 01:53:01,440
The gate.

2515
01:53:01,440 --> 01:53:03,440
You have type cent chance to ignore damage.

2516
01:53:03,440 --> 01:53:05,440
Oh, I forgot about that too.

2517
01:53:05,440 --> 01:53:08,440
Right, so we're supposed to have upgraded arcades now.

2518
01:53:10,440 --> 01:53:12,440
Is this the upgraded arcade experience?

2519
01:53:12,440 --> 01:53:14,440
Because it doesn't look like it.

2520
01:53:14,440 --> 01:53:15,440
I can tell you that much.

2521
01:53:15,440 --> 01:53:16,440
Look, shite.

2522
01:53:19,440 --> 01:53:21,440
Damn right we are.

2523
01:53:21,440 --> 01:53:24,440
I love being tiny, it's another way to say that you like...

2524
01:53:24,440 --> 01:53:25,440
Giant?

2525
01:53:25,440 --> 01:53:27,440
Why do you think there's a giant here?

2526
01:53:27,440 --> 01:53:31,440
Why do you think she can be as tall as a skyscraper, huh?

2527
01:53:32,440 --> 01:53:34,440
I made it that way.

2528
01:53:34,440 --> 01:53:35,440
Did I use my ult?

2529
01:53:35,440 --> 01:53:36,440
I'm just gonna pop it.

2530
01:53:36,440 --> 01:53:37,440
I can never remember.

2531
01:53:38,440 --> 01:53:41,440
The damage, I know.

2532
01:53:41,440 --> 01:53:44,440
And it's only going up every time we get more money.

2533
01:53:44,440 --> 01:53:45,440
Money.

2534
01:53:45,440 --> 01:53:46,440
Money.

2535
01:53:46,440 --> 01:53:48,440
Call me Mr. Krabs.

2536
01:53:52,440 --> 01:53:53,440
Okay.

2537
01:53:54,440 --> 01:53:57,440
Gonna let the game do its thing.

2538
01:54:01,440 --> 01:54:03,440
I do have a sock.

2539
01:54:04,440 --> 01:54:09,440
Now the explosion can hurt me, but it's a homing explosion though.

2540
01:54:09,440 --> 01:54:10,440
How kill was that?

2541
01:54:11,440 --> 01:54:13,440
What do you mean it's super dangerous and I shouldn't do it?

2542
01:54:13,440 --> 01:54:14,440
What?

2543
01:54:14,440 --> 01:54:16,440
Oh come on, we're just having fun.

2544
01:54:18,440 --> 01:54:20,440
What do you mean this is so risky and I shouldn't have picked that up?

2545
01:54:20,440 --> 01:54:23,440
Oh come on, live a little.

2546
01:54:23,440 --> 01:54:26,440
You're such a worrier little weak one.

2547
01:54:26,440 --> 01:54:27,440
No way.

2548
01:54:27,440 --> 01:54:28,440
Pop ult.

2549
01:54:34,440 --> 01:54:35,440
Gumpers?

2550
01:54:35,440 --> 01:54:37,440
We got gumpers.

2551
01:54:37,440 --> 01:54:38,440
Yup.

2552
01:54:39,440 --> 01:54:41,440
And we got gimpers.

2553
01:54:41,440 --> 01:54:42,440
We're in a gimp suit.

2554
01:54:42,440 --> 01:54:44,440
Any hero members?

2555
01:54:46,440 --> 01:54:48,440
We've got a gimp mask.

2556
01:54:48,440 --> 01:54:50,440
I'm not even kidding.

2557
01:54:50,440 --> 01:54:52,440
It's actually in the game.

2558
01:54:52,440 --> 01:54:54,440
Perfection.

2559
01:54:54,440 --> 01:54:55,440
That's a big boy.

2560
01:54:55,440 --> 01:54:58,440
Gen 1, the crater is barely disguised.

2561
01:54:58,440 --> 01:54:59,440
Pink.

2562
01:54:59,440 --> 01:55:00,440
Honestly.

2563
01:55:00,440 --> 01:55:01,440
It was so fun.

2564
01:55:01,440 --> 01:55:12,440
Now I'll also say Gen 2 is not being created in my image with my particular interest in mind.

2565
01:55:12,440 --> 01:55:25,440
However, depending on a few things, it's very unique what we're appealing to.

2566
01:55:25,440 --> 01:55:26,440
What's the rib of greed?

2567
01:55:26,440 --> 01:55:29,440
5% more coins and fewer hearts from room clear.

2568
01:55:29,440 --> 01:55:31,440
Greed and super greed no longer appear.

2569
01:55:31,440 --> 01:55:32,440
I mean, sure.

2570
01:55:34,440 --> 01:55:36,440
Whoa, what did I just...

2571
01:55:37,440 --> 01:55:38,440
Experimental.

2572
01:55:38,440 --> 01:55:39,440
Shot speed up.

2573
01:55:39,440 --> 01:55:40,440
Let's go.

2574
01:55:42,440 --> 01:55:43,440
Not good.

2575
01:55:43,440 --> 01:55:44,440
I like it.

2576
01:55:44,440 --> 01:55:46,440
Considering how your luck was at the start, this is quite a turnaround.

2577
01:55:46,440 --> 01:55:48,440
And whose image is it created?

2578
01:55:48,440 --> 01:55:49,440
The janitor?

2579
01:55:49,440 --> 01:55:50,440
No, the concept.

2580
01:55:50,440 --> 01:55:51,440
I submit what I want.

2581
01:55:51,440 --> 01:55:54,440
I'll show you how it works behind the scenes.

2582
01:55:54,440 --> 01:55:58,440
But I submit what I want and either I get it or not.

2583
01:55:58,440 --> 01:56:01,440
And I just send an art focus board.

2584
01:56:01,440 --> 01:56:07,440
Again, with the second concept artist, I sent her a board of stuff I was interested in.

2585
01:56:07,440 --> 01:56:10,440
She sent me back her version of that.

2586
01:56:10,440 --> 01:56:11,440
Does that make sense?

2587
01:56:11,440 --> 01:56:12,440
That makes sense.

2588
01:56:12,440 --> 01:56:13,440
That's English.

2589
01:56:16,440 --> 01:56:18,440
That's how it's been done.

2590
01:56:18,440 --> 01:56:20,440
But again, I'll show you all the behind the scenes.

2591
01:56:20,440 --> 01:56:27,440
Obviously, Gen 1 was a bit chaotic because it was my first time ever doing anything like that.

2592
01:56:27,440 --> 01:56:30,440
So, it was rather...

2593
01:56:31,440 --> 01:56:33,440
It was a stressful time.

2594
01:56:33,440 --> 01:56:35,440
Let's put it that way.

2595
01:56:35,440 --> 01:56:39,440
But the reason why I'm so happy to talk about...

2596
01:56:39,440 --> 01:56:43,440
And uncomfortable to talk about Generation 2 is because...

2597
01:56:43,440 --> 01:56:46,440
It takes a year for...

2598
01:56:46,440 --> 01:56:49,440
God, balls of steel again.

2599
01:56:49,440 --> 01:56:52,440
Again, it gives us two soul hearts, which is just fantastic.

2600
01:56:53,440 --> 01:56:56,440
God, birthrate on Cana's Bazaar.

2601
01:56:58,440 --> 01:57:00,440
I don't have time for these machines.

2602
01:57:00,440 --> 01:57:02,440
They're going to take too long.

2603
01:57:02,440 --> 01:57:04,440
You know those flames can spawn hearts?

2604
01:57:04,440 --> 01:57:06,440
I didn't... when bombed?

2605
01:57:06,440 --> 01:57:07,440
No.

2606
01:57:09,440 --> 01:57:10,440
What's in here?

2607
01:57:10,440 --> 01:57:11,440
La bomba.

2608
01:57:13,440 --> 01:57:19,440
Now, if I could get blue fly from the shop, that would be great.

2609
01:57:19,440 --> 01:57:21,440
Hive mind, not blue fly, sorry.

2610
01:57:21,440 --> 01:57:22,440
Hive mind.

2611
01:57:24,440 --> 01:57:25,440
No.

2612
01:57:25,440 --> 01:57:26,440
But nice try.

2613
01:57:27,440 --> 01:57:29,440
Made in mommy's image.

2614
01:57:29,440 --> 01:57:31,440
Gotta love the wounds.

2615
01:57:32,440 --> 01:57:34,440
I'm not reading that one out, but you're welcome.

2616
01:57:34,440 --> 01:57:37,440
It's literally like top tier.

2617
01:57:37,440 --> 01:57:39,440
Sorry, I don't care what anyone says.

2618
01:57:39,440 --> 01:57:40,440
That's weird.

2619
01:57:40,440 --> 01:57:42,440
Good thing it's fantasy then.

2620
01:57:42,440 --> 01:57:43,440
Smile.

2621
01:57:43,440 --> 01:57:48,440
Upon death, we spawn Isaac in the same room with half a heart.

2622
01:57:48,440 --> 01:57:50,440
Speed and massive size then.

2623
01:57:50,440 --> 01:57:52,440
Wait, so I can be a tiny baby?

2624
01:57:55,440 --> 01:58:00,440
Wait, you didn't know about the blue flies giving blue hearts when blown up?

2625
01:58:00,440 --> 01:58:02,440
They are very much like a ball.

2626
01:58:02,440 --> 01:58:03,440
You didn't?

2627
01:58:03,440 --> 01:58:04,440
Wait, what?

2628
01:58:04,440 --> 01:58:06,440
You didn't know about the blue...

2629
01:58:06,440 --> 01:58:08,440
Oh, the blue fire is giving soul hearts.

2630
01:58:08,440 --> 01:58:10,440
Yes, no, I knew about that.

2631
01:58:10,440 --> 01:58:12,440
She says that she walks right into it.

2632
01:58:12,440 --> 01:58:14,440
No, I did know about that.

2633
01:58:14,440 --> 01:58:15,440
Why not?

2634
01:58:15,440 --> 01:58:16,440
We might as well do this.

2635
01:58:16,440 --> 01:58:18,440
I'll blitz this over you.

2636
01:58:20,440 --> 01:58:22,440
Yeah, good luck surviving this.

2637
01:58:22,440 --> 01:58:24,440
Yeah, that's right.

2638
01:58:26,440 --> 01:58:28,440
Now we do the boss fight.

2639
01:58:28,440 --> 01:58:30,440
Unless we want to do the angel.

2640
01:58:30,440 --> 01:58:32,440
I can be your angel or your devil.

2641
01:58:34,440 --> 01:58:36,440
I can't see shit.

2642
01:58:36,440 --> 01:58:38,440
Yeah, it does happen.

2643
01:58:42,440 --> 01:58:44,440
Let's not waste too much time.

2644
01:58:44,440 --> 01:58:46,440
I don't want to waste your time.

2645
01:58:46,440 --> 01:58:48,440
I want it to be entertaining.

2646
01:58:48,440 --> 01:58:49,440
I want it to be peak.

2647
01:58:49,440 --> 01:58:50,440
I want it to be high.

2648
01:58:50,440 --> 01:58:52,440
Conga time.

2649
01:58:52,440 --> 01:58:54,440
Like, game Isaac be like,

2650
01:58:54,440 --> 01:58:55,440
we go up this time?

2651
01:58:55,440 --> 01:58:56,440
Yes, we can go up.

2652
01:58:59,440 --> 01:59:02,440
Hey, we can get shooting orbital.

2653
01:59:02,440 --> 01:59:03,440
Oh, that's so good.

2654
01:59:03,440 --> 01:59:05,440
Oh, thank you, game.

2655
01:59:05,440 --> 01:59:07,440
No, really, you shouldn't have.

2656
01:59:07,440 --> 01:59:08,440
You should not have.

2657
01:59:08,440 --> 01:59:09,440
Just keep that.

2658
01:59:10,440 --> 01:59:11,440
Strongly move ball.

2659
01:59:12,440 --> 01:59:15,440
Cathedral music is my fave in the game.

2660
01:59:15,440 --> 01:59:17,440
I really like,

2661
01:59:18,440 --> 01:59:19,440
is it Ghana?

2662
01:59:19,440 --> 01:59:21,440
No, wait, that's the country.

2663
01:59:22,440 --> 01:59:23,440
Hold on.

2664
01:59:24,440 --> 01:59:26,440
The mausoleums?

2665
01:59:28,440 --> 01:59:29,440
It's not Ghana.

2666
01:59:29,440 --> 01:59:31,440
I'm sure that's the country.

2667
01:59:32,440 --> 01:59:34,440
Yeah, Ghana is the country.

2668
01:59:35,440 --> 01:59:36,440
Gehena.

2669
01:59:36,440 --> 01:59:37,440
Gehena?

2670
01:59:37,440 --> 01:59:38,440
That sounds exactly.

2671
01:59:38,440 --> 01:59:39,440
Powerpill.

2672
01:59:40,440 --> 01:59:41,440
No, thank you.

2673
01:59:42,440 --> 01:59:43,440
Gehena.

2674
01:59:44,440 --> 01:59:45,440
Any Gehena

2675
01:59:46,440 --> 01:59:47,440
rappers?

2676
01:59:47,440 --> 01:59:48,440
I don't know if I should do that.

2677
01:59:48,440 --> 01:59:51,440
No, go all out on El Diablo.

2678
01:59:53,440 --> 01:59:54,440
Is it country?

2679
01:59:54,440 --> 01:59:55,440
You're probably talking about...

2680
01:59:55,440 --> 01:59:56,440
Yes, okay, outside.

2681
01:59:56,440 --> 01:59:58,440
Oh, wait, we're already on the last floor?

2682
01:59:58,440 --> 02:00:00,440
No, our last shop.

2683
02:00:01,440 --> 02:00:02,440
Cannot be.

2684
02:00:03,440 --> 02:00:04,440
Don't say such things to me.

2685
02:00:06,440 --> 02:00:08,440
I'm enjoying this run.

2686
02:00:10,440 --> 02:00:12,440
But yeah, if you play victory lap,

2687
02:00:12,440 --> 02:00:13,440
you can pretty much ignore everything.

2688
02:00:13,440 --> 02:00:16,440
If you won once, you can, you know, do it again type thing.

2689
02:00:18,440 --> 02:00:19,440
Wow.

2690
02:00:20,440 --> 02:00:22,440
Oh, wait, it's not open.

2691
02:00:22,440 --> 02:00:23,440
Open.

2692
02:00:25,440 --> 02:00:26,440
Open.

2693
02:00:26,440 --> 02:00:28,440
I just let the flies deal with them.

2694
02:00:30,440 --> 02:00:31,440
Please open.

2695
02:00:31,440 --> 02:00:32,440
Thank you.

2696
02:00:32,440 --> 02:00:33,440
Another victory lap.

2697
02:00:33,440 --> 02:00:34,440
No.

2698
02:00:34,440 --> 02:00:36,440
Okay, we'll take Poki Gold.

2699
02:00:37,440 --> 02:00:39,440
If clearing a room would yield the reward,

2700
02:00:39,440 --> 02:00:40,440
it gives you coins.

2701
02:00:40,440 --> 02:00:41,440
Sure.

2702
02:00:41,440 --> 02:00:43,440
Okay, maybe one more victory lap.

2703
02:00:43,440 --> 02:00:44,440
Just a little one.

2704
02:00:47,440 --> 02:00:48,440
No.

2705
02:00:48,440 --> 02:00:50,440
I don't want one makes you larger.

2706
02:00:50,440 --> 02:00:51,440
You suck.

2707
02:00:51,440 --> 02:00:53,440
I'm back to being normal size.

2708
02:00:53,440 --> 02:00:54,440
Okay, maybe...

2709
02:00:57,440 --> 02:00:59,440
We know where the secret rooms are,

2710
02:00:59,440 --> 02:01:01,440
because we just picked up Tuesia map.

2711
02:01:03,440 --> 02:01:04,440
Wow.

2712
02:01:07,440 --> 02:01:08,440
What's in here?

2713
02:01:08,440 --> 02:01:09,440
A bomb.

2714
02:01:09,440 --> 02:01:10,440
Okay, so that was a waste.

2715
02:01:11,440 --> 02:01:12,440
We're not getting many bomb drops.

2716
02:01:12,440 --> 02:01:15,440
That's my only ditches of my complaint.

2717
02:01:15,440 --> 02:01:16,440
Oh my God, you're complaining about the game

2718
02:01:16,440 --> 02:01:17,440
that you're smurfing right now?

2719
02:01:17,440 --> 02:01:18,440
Yeah.

2720
02:01:19,440 --> 02:01:20,440
What?

2721
02:01:20,440 --> 02:01:22,440
See, if we had Keeper's sack,

2722
02:01:22,440 --> 02:01:24,440
I would have picked this up possibly,

2723
02:01:24,440 --> 02:01:26,440
but I do like that we have infinite health.

2724
02:01:28,440 --> 02:01:29,440
I'm not sure.

2725
02:01:33,440 --> 02:01:34,440
Any bombs?

2726
02:01:35,440 --> 02:01:36,440
Pills.

2727
02:01:36,440 --> 02:01:37,440
Two soul hearts.

2728
02:01:37,440 --> 02:01:38,440
Adult.

2729
02:01:38,440 --> 02:01:41,440
50% to try and die.

2730
02:01:41,440 --> 02:01:43,440
The die appears only then the die doesn't pick up.

2731
02:01:48,440 --> 02:01:49,440
Balls.

2732
02:01:49,440 --> 02:01:50,440
One makes you larger.

2733
02:01:50,440 --> 02:01:51,440
One makes you larger.

2734
02:01:52,440 --> 02:01:53,440
Do we want that?

2735
02:01:54,440 --> 02:01:56,440
I don't think so.

2736
02:01:56,440 --> 02:01:58,440
I've not used it, so I don't think I want it.

2737
02:01:59,440 --> 02:02:00,440
Because that's how it works, right?

2738
02:02:00,440 --> 02:02:01,440
If you've never used it before you.

2739
02:02:01,440 --> 02:02:03,440
I think there might be a secret room.

2740
02:02:03,440 --> 02:02:04,440
There's not.

2741
02:02:05,440 --> 02:02:06,440
I was going to say,

2742
02:02:06,440 --> 02:02:08,440
how have I not consumed all the pills yet?

2743
02:02:08,440 --> 02:02:09,440
I feel like...

2744
02:02:11,440 --> 02:02:13,440
I've seen them all at this point.

2745
02:02:14,440 --> 02:02:15,440
Day's fast proof.

2746
02:02:15,440 --> 02:02:17,440
Mummy, can you check for marked rocks at all?

2747
02:02:18,440 --> 02:02:19,440
I'm full health.

2748
02:02:20,440 --> 02:02:22,440
Is that naughty of me to ignore them?

2749
02:02:26,440 --> 02:02:27,440
Oh, we got boss rush.

2750
02:02:27,440 --> 02:02:28,440
Sure.

2751
02:02:29,440 --> 02:02:30,440
Do you want me to go up, right?

2752
02:02:30,440 --> 02:02:31,440
You wanted me to go up.

2753
02:02:31,440 --> 02:02:32,440
Let's go get this.

2754
02:02:32,440 --> 02:02:33,440
And then we'll do boss rush.

2755
02:02:34,440 --> 02:02:36,440
Yeah, that's perfect for what we need.

2756
02:02:37,440 --> 02:02:38,440
No effect from BFF.

2757
02:02:39,440 --> 02:02:40,440
Stinky.

2758
02:02:41,440 --> 02:02:43,440
And then boss rush is in here.

2759
02:02:44,440 --> 02:02:45,440
Ready?

2760
02:02:45,440 --> 02:02:46,440
Right, we can take...

2761
02:02:47,440 --> 02:02:48,440
Taking damage reduces.

2762
02:02:48,440 --> 02:02:50,440
So that's kind of like the way for it.

2763
02:02:51,440 --> 02:02:52,440
Isaac's movement.

2764
02:02:53,440 --> 02:02:54,440
Charges forward.

2765
02:02:55,440 --> 02:02:56,440
Dies in one hit.

2766
02:02:56,440 --> 02:02:57,440
Oh, that's terrible.

2767
02:02:57,440 --> 02:02:58,440
Um...

2768
02:02:59,440 --> 02:03:02,440
I guess this is technically the way for after one hit.

2769
02:03:04,440 --> 02:03:06,440
Abel, my brother that I perished.

2770
02:03:08,440 --> 02:03:09,440
We'll do the sea bomb.

2771
02:03:15,440 --> 02:03:17,440
They're already perishing.

2772
02:03:18,440 --> 02:03:21,440
I can't remember how many rounds there are,

2773
02:03:21,440 --> 02:03:23,440
but I think there's like eleven or something.

2774
02:03:24,440 --> 02:03:25,440
But we'll...

2775
02:03:26,440 --> 02:03:27,440
We're just gonna send it.

2776
02:03:28,440 --> 02:03:29,440
To no one's surprise,

2777
02:03:29,440 --> 02:03:31,440
we're just gonna spam upwards.

2778
02:03:32,440 --> 02:03:33,440
Boss rush?

2779
02:03:33,440 --> 02:03:35,440
More like massacre, exactly.

2780
02:03:36,440 --> 02:03:38,440
Um, if you are trying to get unlocks,

2781
02:03:38,440 --> 02:03:40,440
unfortunately victory lap,

2782
02:03:40,440 --> 02:03:42,440
like this doesn't count for unlocks.

2783
02:03:42,440 --> 02:03:43,440
So don't...

2784
02:03:43,440 --> 02:03:44,440
Don't think you've got a way out.

2785
02:03:44,440 --> 02:03:46,440
I thought I was so smart doing this.

2786
02:03:46,440 --> 02:03:47,440
I was like,

2787
02:03:47,440 --> 02:03:49,440
I will get all my unlocks to be a victory lap,

2788
02:03:49,440 --> 02:03:51,440
because how can anyone naturally get boss rush?

2789
02:03:52,440 --> 02:03:53,440
Uh, no.

2790
02:03:53,440 --> 02:03:54,440
I...

2791
02:03:54,440 --> 02:03:56,440
My first boss rush was on Eve.

2792
02:03:56,440 --> 02:03:59,440
I accidentally got it on her without realising.

2793
02:03:59,440 --> 02:04:00,440
I was like,

2794
02:04:00,440 --> 02:04:01,440
Oh, what's this room?

2795
02:04:01,440 --> 02:04:03,440
Uh, and...

2796
02:04:03,440 --> 02:04:06,440
Yeah, basically stress myself out to high heaven.

2797
02:04:07,440 --> 02:04:08,440
Who...

2798
02:04:08,440 --> 02:04:09,440
Who or where is this enemy?

2799
02:04:10,440 --> 02:04:11,440
Ah, there we go.

2800
02:04:12,440 --> 02:04:14,440
At least give them a chance, you bully.

2801
02:04:14,440 --> 02:04:16,440
No, I need my full health.

2802
02:04:17,440 --> 02:04:19,440
Give full health or perish.

2803
02:04:22,440 --> 02:04:24,440
Could you imagine you end up doing enough victory laps

2804
02:04:24,440 --> 02:04:25,440
to the point the game crashes?

2805
02:04:25,440 --> 02:04:27,440
Well, funny you mentioned that.

2806
02:04:27,440 --> 02:04:29,440
If you do enough victory laps,

2807
02:04:29,440 --> 02:04:32,440
the game actually starts removing your items.

2808
02:04:33,440 --> 02:04:35,440
And then you become the lost.

2809
02:04:35,440 --> 02:04:37,440
It's really bizarre.

2810
02:04:37,440 --> 02:04:38,440
It just happens.

2811
02:04:39,440 --> 02:04:43,440
I do not want chocolate overridden by C-section.

2812
02:04:43,440 --> 02:04:46,440
Damage scales with the charge time.

2813
02:04:47,440 --> 02:04:48,440
Wait.

2814
02:04:48,440 --> 02:04:50,440
It's overridden by C-section.

2815
02:04:50,440 --> 02:04:52,440
Yeah, so I keep C-section.

2816
02:04:54,440 --> 02:04:57,440
No, I don't want to add to the charge time.

2817
02:04:58,440 --> 02:04:59,440
What did I just pick?

2818
02:04:59,440 --> 02:05:01,440
Did I pick something up there?

2819
02:05:03,440 --> 02:05:04,440
Health up.

2820
02:05:04,440 --> 02:05:05,440
Sure.

2821
02:05:05,440 --> 02:05:06,440
Sure.

2822
02:05:06,440 --> 02:05:07,440
One singular health up.

2823
02:05:07,440 --> 02:05:08,440
Chucky milk.

2824
02:05:08,440 --> 02:05:09,440
Name a more iconic duo then.

2825
02:05:09,440 --> 02:05:10,440
Oh, hey, what's this?

2826
02:05:10,440 --> 02:05:13,440
An incoherent stream and I'll scream and I'll wait.

2827
02:05:14,440 --> 02:05:15,440
You're always stressing.

2828
02:05:15,440 --> 02:05:16,440
I mean, one of them is bar.

2829
02:05:16,440 --> 02:05:17,440
It's not really useful.

2830
02:05:17,440 --> 02:05:18,440
Yeah.

2831
02:05:19,440 --> 02:05:22,440
I think we'll pass on Chucky milk because that...

2832
02:05:22,440 --> 02:05:23,440
I don't know.

2833
02:05:23,440 --> 02:05:25,440
It says chargeable tears.

2834
02:05:25,440 --> 02:05:27,440
Damage scales with charge time.

2835
02:05:27,440 --> 02:05:28,440
Wait, no.

2836
02:05:28,440 --> 02:05:29,440
If it comp...

2837
02:05:29,440 --> 02:05:30,440
Does it complement?

2838
02:05:31,440 --> 02:05:33,440
Maybe it complements?

2839
02:05:33,440 --> 02:05:34,440
I have no idea.

2840
02:05:34,440 --> 02:05:36,440
It didn't really state it changed anything.

2841
02:05:37,440 --> 02:05:38,440
Sure.

2842
02:05:38,440 --> 02:05:39,440
Let's go.

2843
02:05:39,440 --> 02:05:42,440
I don't know if I made it worse or better.

2844
02:05:42,440 --> 02:05:44,440
Somebody come get her.

2845
02:05:45,440 --> 02:05:47,440
She didn't just like us.

2846
02:05:49,440 --> 02:05:51,440
We go arcade with this.

2847
02:05:51,440 --> 02:05:53,440
And of course, I can't see my health.

2848
02:05:53,440 --> 02:05:55,440
Because why would I be able to?

2849
02:05:55,440 --> 02:05:58,440
I'm going to pulp this to make sure that we get our Chucky item.

2850
02:05:59,440 --> 02:06:02,440
No, we need more damage.

2851
02:06:03,440 --> 02:06:04,440
I do need more damage.

2852
02:06:04,440 --> 02:06:05,440
I can hear my data weak.

2853
02:06:05,440 --> 02:06:07,440
He's making a call for me.

2854
02:06:08,440 --> 02:06:10,440
Make me a T-ball yet out of me.

2855
02:06:14,440 --> 02:06:15,440
Okay.

2856
02:06:15,440 --> 02:06:17,440
We might be able to get an item out of this.

2857
02:06:17,440 --> 02:06:19,440
Nope, that was wishful thinking.

2858
02:06:19,440 --> 02:06:22,440
We do love a bit of wishful thinking around these parts, don't we?

2859
02:06:22,440 --> 02:06:23,440
Yes.

2860
02:06:23,440 --> 02:06:25,440
So actually, this is a little thing.

2861
02:06:25,440 --> 02:06:29,440
So you see how we can see top right the other secret room?

2862
02:06:29,440 --> 02:06:31,440
Because it's a super secret room.

2863
02:06:31,440 --> 02:06:32,440
That's an indicator.

2864
02:06:32,440 --> 02:06:35,440
It's actually where the boss fight is.

2865
02:06:38,440 --> 02:06:39,440
I did consider it.

2866
02:06:39,440 --> 02:06:41,440
It's very plausible.

2867
02:06:42,440 --> 02:06:51,440
I think my landlord is nice enough to let me install a temporary pool.

2868
02:06:52,440 --> 02:06:54,440
I mean, I put a damage up a bit.

2869
02:06:56,440 --> 02:06:58,440
Give us film towel kits.

2870
02:06:59,440 --> 02:07:02,440
Oh yeah, we should be picking up money because we have...

2871
02:07:08,440 --> 02:07:09,440
That pool.

2872
02:07:09,440 --> 02:07:10,440
Your dad would make you tea.

2873
02:07:10,440 --> 02:07:11,440
Yeah.

2874
02:07:12,440 --> 02:07:14,440
It's kind of custom.

2875
02:07:15,440 --> 02:07:17,440
You know, you make your family member a cup of tea.

2876
02:07:17,440 --> 02:07:19,440
Like when you go, do you want a cup of tea?

2877
02:07:19,440 --> 02:07:20,440
You offer it to each other?

2878
02:07:20,440 --> 02:07:21,440
Who or where?

2879
02:07:21,440 --> 02:07:22,440
Whoa!

2880
02:07:23,440 --> 02:07:24,440
Oops.

2881
02:07:26,440 --> 02:07:29,440
Oh, we get mother transformation as well.

2882
02:07:29,440 --> 02:07:30,440
Yes, mother.

2883
02:07:33,440 --> 02:07:35,440
Oh, random rune shard.

2884
02:07:35,440 --> 02:07:38,440
We're going to step over art tile.

2885
02:07:38,440 --> 02:07:39,440
Maybe we'll get...

2886
02:07:39,440 --> 02:07:40,440
No, that didn't work.

2887
02:07:41,440 --> 02:07:42,440
Well, we tried our best.

2888
02:07:43,440 --> 02:07:44,440
I can't always work out.

2889
02:07:44,440 --> 02:07:45,440
Whoa!

2890
02:07:48,440 --> 02:07:50,440
17.68.

2891
02:07:50,440 --> 02:07:53,440
This is getting astronomical.

2892
02:07:54,440 --> 02:07:55,440
Two soul hearts.

2893
02:07:55,440 --> 02:07:56,440
I'll hold on to you.

2894
02:07:57,440 --> 02:07:58,440
I'm going to hold on to that.

2895
02:07:58,440 --> 02:07:59,440
100%.

2896
02:08:01,440 --> 02:08:03,440
Thank you for the tip, really legend.

2897
02:08:04,440 --> 02:08:06,440
I definitely considered for 3D.

2898
02:08:06,440 --> 02:08:08,440
I'm not going to pretend otherwise.

2899
02:08:09,440 --> 02:08:10,440
Definitely considered.

2900
02:08:12,440 --> 02:08:14,440
More damage because reasons.

2901
02:08:14,440 --> 02:08:15,440
Why, yeah.

2902
02:08:15,440 --> 02:08:16,440
A library again?

2903
02:08:18,440 --> 02:08:19,440
Oh, wow.

2904
02:08:20,440 --> 02:08:23,440
You can pop this one because it gives us a wee familiar.

2905
02:08:25,440 --> 02:08:27,440
Oh, I've got a wee fly that goes around me.

2906
02:08:27,440 --> 02:08:28,440
Save first.

2907
02:08:32,440 --> 02:08:33,440
Imagine.

2908
02:08:33,440 --> 02:08:34,440
Interesting.

2909
02:08:34,440 --> 02:08:35,440
Here I come.

2910
02:08:35,440 --> 02:08:37,440
It's common that the younger one serves the older one.

2911
02:08:40,440 --> 02:08:42,440
Not in my household.

2912
02:08:45,440 --> 02:08:48,440
We're just kind of like mom's pearl.

2913
02:08:50,440 --> 02:08:52,440
No, that's definitely not my household.

2914
02:08:52,440 --> 02:08:54,440
Everyone's just nice to each other's smile.

2915
02:08:54,440 --> 02:08:56,440
It doesn't matter when you were born.

2916
02:08:58,440 --> 02:09:00,440
Because that's like cheesy doodling.

2917
02:09:00,440 --> 02:09:02,440
I was born for...

2918
02:09:02,440 --> 02:09:04,440
It's giving I was born first.

2919
02:09:04,440 --> 02:09:06,440
That's what children argue on the playground.

2920
02:09:06,440 --> 02:09:07,440
I was born first.

2921
02:09:07,440 --> 02:09:09,440
You have to be nice to me and do as I say.

2922
02:09:09,440 --> 02:09:10,440
No, that's not how it works.

2923
02:09:10,440 --> 02:09:12,440
Not from around these parts.

2924
02:09:12,440 --> 02:09:13,440
Not from around here.

2925
02:09:15,440 --> 02:09:18,440
Age has no correlation to how nice you can be.

2926
02:09:21,440 --> 02:09:23,440
I mean, we don't need it.

2927
02:09:24,440 --> 02:09:26,440
But we're going to take up the money.

2928
02:09:27,440 --> 02:09:29,440
Because it's not about the money, money, money.

2929
02:09:33,440 --> 02:09:36,440
I don't see the appeal of pole dancing.

2930
02:09:36,440 --> 02:09:37,440
You don't?

2931
02:09:39,440 --> 02:09:41,440
Isn't it like normal dancing?

2932
02:09:41,440 --> 02:09:43,440
No, it's like supposed to be all...

2933
02:09:43,440 --> 02:09:46,440
Have you never been to the Unicorn Palace in GTA?

2934
02:09:48,440 --> 02:09:51,440
You've never been to the Unicorn Palace in GTA?

2935
02:09:52,440 --> 02:09:53,440
In no way.

2936
02:09:53,440 --> 02:09:54,440
In no way.

2937
02:09:55,440 --> 02:09:57,440
3D Ring Fit Adventure Stream.

2938
02:09:57,440 --> 02:10:00,440
I do have a Ring Fit coming out next week.

2939
02:10:00,440 --> 02:10:01,440
Next week.

2940
02:10:03,440 --> 02:10:06,440
But yeah, if I get 3D, I'd 100% be down.

2941
02:10:07,440 --> 02:10:09,440
I'll pop my ult, but I don't think I need it.

2942
02:10:11,440 --> 02:10:13,440
Sure, let's go in the secret room.

2943
02:10:13,440 --> 02:10:15,440
So again, we can see where the other secret room is.

2944
02:10:15,440 --> 02:10:17,440
And it's an indicator that most likely...

2945
02:10:20,440 --> 02:10:22,440
Who or what did that?

2946
02:10:22,440 --> 02:10:23,440
Oh, not up to it right now.

2947
02:10:24,440 --> 02:10:26,440
I'm going to pop this guy so we can get increased.

2948
02:10:26,440 --> 02:10:27,440
Yeah, there we go.

2949
02:10:28,440 --> 02:10:29,440
A 1 tooth piece.

2950
02:10:30,440 --> 02:10:31,440
Imagine...

2951
02:10:33,440 --> 02:10:35,440
Oh, we get damage up for it.

2952
02:10:35,440 --> 02:10:36,440
Let's go.

2953
02:10:38,440 --> 02:10:40,440
19 damage.

2954
02:10:41,440 --> 02:10:42,440
Hair tier.

2955
02:10:43,440 --> 02:10:47,440
And that doesn't even include all of the other effects that come with it.

2956
02:10:49,440 --> 02:10:51,440
I'm surprised we're actually getting room cleared.

2957
02:10:51,440 --> 02:10:53,440
Wait, the boss room isn't this way?

2958
02:10:53,440 --> 02:10:55,440
I can't believe that I've been lied to.

2959
02:10:56,440 --> 02:10:58,440
Reduces all Devil deals to a heart.

2960
02:10:58,440 --> 02:11:00,440
It doesn't reduce the other ones though.

2961
02:11:00,440 --> 02:11:01,440
No, I've actually...

2962
02:11:01,440 --> 02:11:03,440
My item I've got right now...

2963
02:11:04,440 --> 02:11:05,440
I use Black Feather.

2964
02:11:06,440 --> 02:11:10,440
Every evil item I own, my damage goes up by 0.5.

2965
02:11:10,440 --> 02:11:15,440
And because we're taking tons of Devil deals, it's going up.

2966
02:11:20,440 --> 02:11:21,440
I'll pop my ult.

2967
02:11:22,440 --> 02:11:23,440
Okay, well, I shouldn't have.

2968
02:11:23,440 --> 02:11:24,440
But I did.

2969
02:11:25,440 --> 02:11:28,440
Whoa, we get fire rate up and 3 coins.

2970
02:11:33,440 --> 02:11:35,440
I think he just passed the boss room.

2971
02:11:35,440 --> 02:11:38,440
I saw a health bar on the screen for a moment.

2972
02:11:38,440 --> 02:11:39,440
No, that can't...

2973
02:11:39,440 --> 02:11:41,440
It doesn't work like that, you goober.

2974
02:11:42,440 --> 02:11:43,440
You're teasing me.

2975
02:11:43,440 --> 02:11:45,440
That's not how it works.

2976
02:11:48,440 --> 02:11:50,440
Oh wait, why does it go that way?

2977
02:11:53,440 --> 02:11:54,440
Okay, let's...

2978
02:11:54,440 --> 02:11:56,440
Oh, we're at 20 per tier now.

2979
02:11:59,440 --> 02:12:00,440
Oh, will we do Hush?

2980
02:12:00,440 --> 02:12:01,440
Let's do Hush.

2981
02:12:03,440 --> 02:12:05,440
Oh, it's Dark Bomb.

2982
02:12:05,440 --> 02:12:07,440
Okay, you come in and then...

2983
02:12:07,440 --> 02:12:09,440
Killing an enemy has a chance to spawn the ghost.

2984
02:12:09,440 --> 02:12:10,440
Here, you come in too.

2985
02:12:12,440 --> 02:12:14,440
And then we'll go do Hush.

2986
02:12:14,440 --> 02:12:19,440
So Hush is the last time Isaac breathes.

2987
02:12:20,440 --> 02:12:25,440
Hush can't fight back because of the shielded tears.

2988
02:12:25,440 --> 02:12:27,440
Hey, Stony, can you kill the boss again?

2989
02:12:27,440 --> 02:12:28,440
I blinked.

2990
02:12:28,440 --> 02:12:30,440
Yeah, I can kill that boss again.

2991
02:12:34,440 --> 02:12:36,440
Oh, that was a good kill.

2992
02:12:36,440 --> 02:12:38,440
Oh, I had balls of steel on me.

2993
02:12:43,440 --> 02:12:44,440
Oh, the music's on.

2994
02:12:44,440 --> 02:12:45,440
It's the music's on.

2995
02:12:45,440 --> 02:12:47,440
We've already got last...

2996
02:12:47,440 --> 02:12:48,440
Wait, how did it double up?

2997
02:12:48,440 --> 02:12:50,440
Would it have just become bigger?

2998
02:12:50,440 --> 02:12:51,440
No, I wouldn't.

2999
02:12:52,440 --> 02:12:59,440
So normally there is a crawl space in these rooms.

3000
02:13:01,440 --> 02:13:05,440
I do say the term normally in quotation marks.

3001
02:13:09,440 --> 02:13:12,440
Okay, I do say the word normally there's a hidden...

3002
02:13:12,440 --> 02:13:19,440
Oh, grants immunity to explosions and damage.

3003
02:13:23,440 --> 02:13:28,440
Okay, normally there's a hidden crawl space.

3004
02:13:29,440 --> 02:13:31,440
Normally...

3005
02:13:31,440 --> 02:13:32,440
Yes!

3006
02:13:32,440 --> 02:13:33,440
There we go.

3007
02:13:33,440 --> 02:13:35,440
Normally there's a hidden crawl space.

3008
02:13:35,440 --> 02:13:37,440
And we got Hush.

3009
02:13:37,440 --> 02:13:38,440
Okay.

3010
02:13:38,440 --> 02:13:40,440
I love how Stony plays the same game over and over.

3011
02:13:40,440 --> 02:13:42,440
She just let me through for real though.

3012
02:13:42,440 --> 02:13:44,440
Bandit only took me like...

3013
02:13:45,440 --> 02:13:47,440
Chose between two items?

3014
02:13:47,440 --> 02:13:49,440
No, that's terrible.

3015
02:13:50,440 --> 02:13:53,440
I think I'm better just keeping my minions.

3016
02:13:56,440 --> 02:13:58,440
I'll pick up a tally pill.

3017
02:13:59,440 --> 02:14:02,440
Right, we are ready to take on old Hush.

3018
02:14:02,440 --> 02:14:07,440
If you look at the wall decorations, you can see the faces of the enemy.

3019
02:14:07,440 --> 02:14:09,440
Roll a d4 for the memes.

3020
02:14:09,440 --> 02:14:10,440
Are you kidding?

3021
02:14:10,440 --> 02:14:12,440
I've never had such a good run.

3022
02:14:13,440 --> 02:14:14,440
That's kind of funny though.

3023
02:14:17,440 --> 02:14:19,440
Maybe we go to Delirium.

3024
02:14:21,440 --> 02:14:22,440
What we do, Delirium?

3025
02:14:22,440 --> 02:14:23,440
We could.

3026
02:14:23,440 --> 02:14:24,440
Where is we?

3027
02:14:25,440 --> 02:14:26,440
Get over here.

3028
02:14:32,440 --> 02:14:33,440
A monkey on a pool.

3029
02:14:33,440 --> 02:14:36,440
Well, you need to give me time to learn.

3030
02:14:36,440 --> 02:14:37,440
Thank you for the tip, Iron Reaper.

3031
02:14:37,440 --> 02:14:39,440
You need to give me time to learn.

3032
02:14:40,440 --> 02:14:44,440
But, I mean, a bit of cheeky 3D tracking on.

3033
02:14:44,440 --> 02:14:45,440
Get me going.

3034
02:14:45,440 --> 02:14:48,440
We roll your whole bill, should we?

3035
02:14:50,440 --> 02:14:53,440
Right, how about we go take on Delirium.

3036
02:14:53,440 --> 02:14:55,440
And I'll re-roll my whole bill.

3037
02:14:59,440 --> 02:15:02,440
I'm gonna not go well at all.

3038
02:15:03,440 --> 02:15:05,440
I'm not even paying attention.

3039
02:15:05,440 --> 02:15:06,440
I'm just spamming.

3040
02:15:06,440 --> 02:15:07,440
I don't even know if I've lost any health.

3041
02:15:07,440 --> 02:15:11,440
Look at the purgatory just going crazy.

3042
02:15:11,440 --> 02:15:13,440
See all those little red guys?

3043
02:15:15,440 --> 02:15:20,440
Oh, is that why I'm getting fed pills by a dark bum?

3044
02:15:23,440 --> 02:15:26,440
Alright, we'll re-roll into Delirium and see what happens.

3045
02:15:26,440 --> 02:15:29,440
I'm gonna regret it so much, but why not?

3046
02:15:30,440 --> 02:15:32,440
Whoa, he's crying.

3047
02:15:32,440 --> 02:15:34,440
Don't cry.

3048
02:15:40,440 --> 02:15:41,440
Or should?

3049
02:15:41,440 --> 02:15:43,440
Maybe I shouldn't re-roll.

3050
02:15:44,440 --> 02:15:45,440
I'm scared.

3051
02:15:45,440 --> 02:15:46,440
Do we have to re-roll?

3052
02:15:46,440 --> 02:15:48,440
Okay, I don't want to do Delirium.

3053
02:15:48,440 --> 02:15:51,440
If we do Delirium, am I allowed to not re-roll?

3054
02:15:51,440 --> 02:15:53,440
Because I quite like what I've got.

3055
02:15:53,440 --> 02:15:56,440
I've got like Guppy, I've got Mum, I've got Flay,

3056
02:15:56,440 --> 02:15:58,440
I've got Spectre, I've got everything.

3057
02:15:58,440 --> 02:15:59,440
Don't re-roll, don't re-roll.

3058
02:15:59,440 --> 02:16:00,440
Okay, okay, okay.

3059
02:16:00,440 --> 02:16:01,440
Thank you.

3060
02:16:01,440 --> 02:16:02,440
Sorry.

3061
02:16:02,440 --> 02:16:03,440
Right, well, do Delirium is...

3062
02:16:03,440 --> 02:16:04,440
Thank you.

3063
02:16:07,440 --> 02:16:10,440
I am doing a victory lap.

3064
02:16:10,440 --> 02:16:13,440
That is why I have so many items on my Persons.

3065
02:16:14,440 --> 02:16:21,440
That little flag means I am on a run.

3066
02:16:23,440 --> 02:16:25,440
I'm on a rune.

3067
02:16:26,440 --> 02:16:27,440
Speed up.

3068
02:16:27,440 --> 02:16:28,440
I'm already...

3069
02:16:28,440 --> 02:16:31,440
My speed drives the telepills.

3070
02:16:33,440 --> 02:16:35,440
Oh wait, you can't get a...

3071
02:16:36,440 --> 02:16:41,440
I was gonna say you can't get an I am error with this kind of stuff.

3072
02:16:42,440 --> 02:16:43,440
Alright, what's in here?

3073
02:16:44,440 --> 02:16:46,440
We've got the Headless Horseman.

3074
02:16:46,440 --> 02:16:47,440
She's on a victory lap.

3075
02:16:47,440 --> 02:16:48,440
Don't risk it yet.

3076
02:16:48,440 --> 02:16:50,440
Well, do Delirium.

3077
02:16:50,440 --> 02:16:51,440
Health?

3078
02:16:51,440 --> 02:16:53,440
Don't really need health.

3079
02:16:57,440 --> 02:16:59,440
Sure, we can open that.

3080
02:16:59,440 --> 02:17:01,440
Again, with Memic Chest, we can just straight up open them

3081
02:17:01,440 --> 02:17:09,440
because we have Holy Mantles, so it's not a problem for us.

3082
02:17:10,440 --> 02:17:13,440
We are gonna get the Secret Room that's over here.

3083
02:17:15,440 --> 02:17:17,440
What's inside?

3084
02:17:17,440 --> 02:17:19,440
Absolutely nothing.

3085
02:17:20,440 --> 02:17:22,440
We've been trolled by the one...

3086
02:17:22,440 --> 02:17:26,440
Oh, well we'll take the money because again, we have deeper pockets.

3087
02:17:26,440 --> 02:17:31,440
We actually should be picking up every single penny, but I'm being lazy.

3088
02:17:33,440 --> 02:17:34,440
Something's happening over there.

3089
02:17:34,440 --> 02:17:37,440
Debizzle can pick up all these.

3090
02:17:38,440 --> 02:17:40,440
What just happened?

3091
02:17:40,440 --> 02:17:42,440
Oh, nothing's getting me.

3092
02:17:42,440 --> 02:17:43,440
What did you just throw at me?

3093
02:17:43,440 --> 02:17:46,440
I don't know what he gave me, but thank you for it anyway.

3094
02:17:46,440 --> 02:17:48,440
I'm quite happy with that.

3095
02:17:49,440 --> 02:17:51,440
Health turns off Polaroid.

3096
02:17:51,440 --> 02:17:55,440
Yeah, I'm not gonna pick up any red.

3097
02:17:57,440 --> 02:18:00,440
Again, we are gonna try and pick up as much coin.

3098
02:18:01,440 --> 02:18:04,440
Got Toxic Shock because I've got so much damage.

3099
02:18:04,440 --> 02:18:08,440
Toxic Shock is actually killing enemies as we enter the room.

3100
02:18:10,440 --> 02:18:12,440
I mean, I'll take a quarter.

3101
02:18:12,440 --> 02:18:14,440
You don't have to tell me twice.

3102
02:18:14,440 --> 02:18:18,440
We just went up like a full mom's heart.

3103
02:18:20,440 --> 02:18:25,440
Oh, tears. Absolutely.

3104
02:18:28,440 --> 02:18:30,440
We can fly over everything.

3105
02:18:33,440 --> 02:18:37,440
Now, Delirium can only spawn...

3106
02:18:37,440 --> 02:18:40,440
Strony Dominating is just natural.

3107
02:18:40,440 --> 02:18:41,440
So you admit it.

3108
02:18:41,440 --> 02:18:43,440
I'm a dumb. Got you.

3109
02:18:44,440 --> 02:18:45,440
And 4 Key.

3110
02:18:46,440 --> 02:18:48,440
You admit it yourself.

3111
02:18:48,440 --> 02:18:49,440
Thank you.

3112
02:18:49,440 --> 02:18:51,440
There is a tentacle here.

3113
02:18:52,440 --> 02:18:54,440
Maybe an item.

3114
02:18:54,440 --> 02:18:56,440
We got money. We got money.

3115
02:18:57,440 --> 02:19:00,440
We don't need that debuzzle, but thank you.

3116
02:19:00,440 --> 02:19:02,440
I've been in that room, so we'll go this way next.

3117
02:19:02,440 --> 02:19:03,440
We'll pick up.

3118
02:19:03,440 --> 02:19:05,440
No, you big sub. How dare you?

3119
02:19:06,440 --> 02:19:08,440
You just admitted I wasn't.

3120
02:19:10,440 --> 02:19:13,440
We get a stat up from this pill, whatever it's gonna be.

3121
02:19:14,440 --> 02:19:15,440
Luck.

3122
02:19:15,440 --> 02:19:17,440
I think we've got enough luck for one day.

3123
02:19:17,440 --> 02:19:19,440
I'm gonna be honest, little guy.

3124
02:19:21,440 --> 02:19:23,440
Dumb only in this game.

3125
02:19:23,440 --> 02:19:25,440
Mummy gets moonies.

3126
02:19:28,440 --> 02:19:32,440
We're fully, we're fully all in on black hearts, actually,

3127
02:19:32,440 --> 02:19:35,440
which makes us super potent.

3128
02:19:35,440 --> 02:19:39,440
And we got page 2, which means we do extra damage.

3129
02:19:40,440 --> 02:19:44,440
Now, I'm curious if delirium, because we know where the other secret room is.

3130
02:19:44,440 --> 02:19:47,440
If delirium is next to that secret room.

3131
02:19:48,440 --> 02:19:49,440
Adverture.

3132
02:19:50,440 --> 02:19:52,440
If that is an indication.

3133
02:19:52,440 --> 02:19:54,440
We're at 23 damage.

3134
02:19:54,440 --> 02:19:56,440
Can we get 24?

3135
02:19:56,440 --> 02:20:00,440
Right, I'm gonna go up on purpose to try and collect as much money as possible.

3136
02:20:00,440 --> 02:20:04,440
And get as much boss fights for extra items as possible.

3137
02:20:06,440 --> 02:20:08,440
Cheeky item? No.

3138
02:20:08,440 --> 02:20:11,440
24 now, between every shot.

3139
02:20:11,440 --> 02:20:13,440
That's amazing.

3140
02:20:14,440 --> 02:20:17,440
There's so much going on the screen, though.

3141
02:20:22,440 --> 02:20:24,440
Time to mega-mush in a rock bottom.

3142
02:20:24,440 --> 02:20:28,440
I don't have rock bottom unlocked, I don't think.

3143
02:20:28,440 --> 02:20:32,440
I think you need to do boss rush Jacob and Isle on hard mode.

3144
02:20:33,440 --> 02:20:37,440
I don't even think I have rock bottom.

3145
02:20:37,440 --> 02:20:39,440
I wish I could get rock bottom.

3146
02:20:39,440 --> 02:20:44,440
I'm so curious to unlock death certificate, but I'm so far away, so...

3147
02:20:44,440 --> 02:20:47,440
I really suck on Bethany.

3148
02:20:47,440 --> 02:20:49,440
I have a really hard time on that.

3149
02:20:49,440 --> 02:20:51,440
Where am I going?

3150
02:21:01,440 --> 02:21:03,440
Anonymous, thank you for the tip.

3151
02:21:03,440 --> 02:21:06,440
I'm curious, do you spend time playing with someone special?

3152
02:21:06,440 --> 02:21:10,440
Or would you say you're competitive gaming to win?

3153
02:21:13,440 --> 02:21:15,440
I...

3154
02:21:15,440 --> 02:21:16,440
I guess?

3155
02:21:16,440 --> 02:21:21,440
Because I like playing with you guys, I'd rather have quality time playing multiplayer games.

3156
02:21:21,440 --> 02:21:25,440
If I'm not good at a game, I don't play it.

3157
02:21:25,440 --> 02:21:28,440
That sounds like such a sore loser, but I am.

3158
02:21:28,440 --> 02:21:32,440
If I'm not good at the game, I'm just like, what's the point?

3159
02:21:32,440 --> 02:21:34,440
I suck.

3160
02:21:34,440 --> 02:21:37,440
I don't want to put my time into something I suck.

3161
02:21:37,440 --> 02:21:39,440
But Elden Ring, for example.

3162
02:21:39,440 --> 02:21:41,440
I'm absolutely terrible at Elden Ring.

3163
02:21:41,440 --> 02:21:44,440
I have never had so much fun playing a game.

3164
02:21:44,440 --> 02:21:47,440
Commentate and stuff in my face.

3165
02:21:47,440 --> 02:21:52,440
You guys make that game so fun for me, and you make it playable for me.

3166
02:21:52,440 --> 02:21:56,440
Because if I had to play it the natural way, like the actual way...

3167
02:21:59,440 --> 02:22:02,440
I don't think I could enjoy it, so it's thanks to you guys,

3168
02:22:02,440 --> 02:22:07,440
I can literally enjoy a game that unironically wouldn't be accessible to me

3169
02:22:07,440 --> 02:22:12,440
due to my stubbornness of, oh, if I'm not good at the game, I'm not playing it.

3170
02:22:12,440 --> 02:22:17,440
Because I don't spend overwork myself,

3171
02:22:17,440 --> 02:22:19,440
and then go, oh, you know what?

3172
02:22:19,440 --> 02:22:23,440
I fancy getting absolutely demolished in a game for eight hours.

3173
02:22:23,440 --> 02:22:26,440
I don't really tickle my fancy.

3174
02:22:26,440 --> 02:22:29,440
It might for some people, but for me, yeah, not really.

3175
02:22:29,440 --> 02:22:32,440
That is a friendly enemy before you panic.

3176
02:22:32,440 --> 02:22:34,440
Please don't panic, guys.

3177
02:22:34,440 --> 02:22:40,440
We've got two balls of steel pills, so I'm going to keep them on hold.

3178
02:22:40,440 --> 02:22:42,440
We've already got max speed, so...

3179
02:22:46,440 --> 02:22:48,440
Do you have any tainted unlocks?

3180
02:22:48,440 --> 02:22:52,440
I do, I will show you after we finish this victory.

3181
02:22:54,440 --> 02:22:56,440
It's a turd, it's a brownie.

3182
02:22:56,440 --> 02:22:59,440
That's kind of the point of Souls game.

3183
02:22:59,440 --> 02:23:02,440
Well, I mean, I can enjoy it with you guys, so I don't count.

3184
02:23:02,440 --> 02:23:04,440
Really, alabaster box?

3185
02:23:04,440 --> 02:23:07,440
Right, you should be ashamed of yourself.

3186
02:23:08,440 --> 02:23:12,440
More like, full of rubbish box.

3187
02:23:12,440 --> 02:23:14,440
Thank you, I'll be here all week.

3188
02:23:14,440 --> 02:23:17,440
Right, I'm purposely avoiding that last boss room,

3189
02:23:17,440 --> 02:23:20,440
but I think that's where our enemy resides.

3190
02:23:22,440 --> 02:23:23,440
By the Pope.

3191
02:23:33,440 --> 02:23:35,440
I'd basically come to you and be like,

3192
02:23:35,440 --> 02:23:37,440
Riefling, I can't get past this part,

3193
02:23:37,440 --> 02:23:40,440
and then you have to come through and get me past it.

3194
02:23:40,440 --> 02:23:45,440
And then 20 minutes later, Riefling, I can't do it.

3195
02:23:45,440 --> 02:23:47,440
Thanks for the tip, Anonymous.

3196
02:23:48,440 --> 02:23:51,440
Literally, you're trying to do your own gaming session.

3197
02:23:51,440 --> 02:23:54,440
I'm like, Riefling, please, I can't do this.

3198
02:23:55,440 --> 02:23:57,440
Right, it looks like...

3199
02:23:59,440 --> 02:24:00,440
We're here.

3200
02:24:02,440 --> 02:24:04,440
What the f...

3201
02:24:04,440 --> 02:24:05,440
What?

3202
02:24:06,440 --> 02:24:07,440
Emmanuel Coppa?

3203
02:24:07,440 --> 02:24:09,440
Coppa D's nuts and my mouth.

3204
02:24:09,440 --> 02:24:10,440
Thank you for the 50.

3205
02:24:10,440 --> 02:24:11,440
Gluck Gluck.

3206
02:24:11,440 --> 02:24:12,440
Are you serious?

3207
02:24:13,440 --> 02:24:14,440
That's a lot.

3208
02:24:14,440 --> 02:24:16,440
Thank you, Emmanuel.

3209
02:24:17,440 --> 02:24:19,440
Jeez, Louise.

3210
02:24:22,440 --> 02:24:23,440
Wow.

3211
02:24:25,440 --> 02:24:26,440
Thank you very much.

3212
02:24:26,440 --> 02:24:28,440
So we're like a big brother to you,

3213
02:24:28,440 --> 02:24:30,440
then playing the hard parts for you.

3214
02:24:30,440 --> 02:24:31,440
I mean, literally.

3215
02:24:31,440 --> 02:24:32,440
Yeah.

3216
02:24:33,440 --> 02:24:35,440
Thank you so much.

3217
02:24:35,440 --> 02:24:38,440
Congrats to everyone who caught that with their faces.

3218
02:24:39,440 --> 02:24:41,440
You might have a prompt in chat.

3219
02:24:42,440 --> 02:24:46,440
That'll tell you, like, oh, I think Delirium's in that room, by the way.

3220
02:24:46,440 --> 02:24:48,440
You might have a prompt in chat where you have to, like,

3221
02:24:48,440 --> 02:24:49,440
enable the thingy-ma-bobber.

3222
02:24:49,440 --> 02:24:53,440
You just do that, and you'll hopefully catch it.

3223
02:24:53,440 --> 02:24:56,440
I do have new emotes coming very soon to you.

3224
02:24:56,440 --> 02:24:58,440
Very, very soon to you.

3225
02:24:59,440 --> 02:25:01,440
The girls are getting their emotes first,

3226
02:25:01,440 --> 02:25:03,440
because, you know, we can be patient.

3227
02:25:03,440 --> 02:25:05,440
But thank you so much, Emmanuel Coppa.

3228
02:25:05,440 --> 02:25:06,440
That's crazy.

3229
02:25:07,440 --> 02:25:11,440
I'm still assigning people to even get the gifted membership.

3230
02:25:11,440 --> 02:25:13,440
And thank you, Broly Legend.

3231
02:25:13,440 --> 02:25:14,440
Not gonna lie, I would love that.

3232
02:25:14,440 --> 02:25:16,440
Yeah, you'd love carrying me in my games.

3233
02:25:16,440 --> 02:25:18,440
Mummy's sitting on her lap as we help her.

3234
02:25:18,440 --> 02:25:20,440
Emote teaser.

3235
02:25:20,440 --> 02:25:22,440
Blast from the past.

3236
02:25:22,440 --> 02:25:23,440
Are you squidding me right now?

3237
02:25:23,440 --> 02:25:26,440
Stroney's the little sister that gets you to do the hard parts of the game,

3238
02:25:26,440 --> 02:25:30,440
and in return, she does the hard parts for you.

3239
02:25:30,440 --> 02:25:32,440
Ay, yeah.

3240
02:25:32,440 --> 02:25:34,440
What's that mean?

3241
02:25:34,440 --> 02:25:36,440
I don't think I know what I mean.

3242
02:25:36,440 --> 02:25:38,440
Ah, shot and behavior.

3243
02:25:38,440 --> 02:25:40,440
Holy crap.

3244
02:25:40,440 --> 02:25:44,440
Literally, it's still going, Emmanuel.

3245
02:25:46,440 --> 02:25:48,440
It's still going, right?

3246
02:25:48,440 --> 02:25:50,440
Hydration check.

3247
02:25:50,440 --> 02:25:53,440
That last part isn't for you.

3248
02:25:53,440 --> 02:25:55,440
Oh, of you, and does the hard parts of you.

3249
02:25:55,440 --> 02:25:57,440
Oh, okay, okay, okay.

3250
02:25:59,440 --> 02:26:00,440
What a spammer.

3251
02:26:00,440 --> 02:26:01,440
I can't believe it.

3252
02:26:01,440 --> 02:26:02,440
No, I'm kidding.

3253
02:26:02,440 --> 02:26:03,440
Do not time anyone.

3254
02:26:03,440 --> 02:26:05,440
Jesus, are you joking?

3255
02:26:07,440 --> 02:26:08,440
Congrats on the membership.

3256
02:26:08,440 --> 02:26:10,440
Yeah, congrats on who caught it with her faces.

3257
02:26:10,440 --> 02:26:12,440
Oh, crap.

3258
02:26:12,440 --> 02:26:13,440
Thank you again, Emmanuel.

3259
02:26:13,440 --> 02:26:15,440
It's 50.

3260
02:26:15,440 --> 02:26:16,440
50.

3261
02:26:16,440 --> 02:26:17,440
That's a big number.

3262
02:26:17,440 --> 02:26:19,440
Okay, sometimes there's wee numbers,

3263
02:26:19,440 --> 02:26:21,440
and sometimes there's big numbers, okay?

3264
02:26:21,440 --> 02:26:22,440
That was a lot of money.

3265
02:26:22,440 --> 02:26:24,440
How much money was that?

3266
02:26:26,440 --> 02:26:28,440
Is that like $300?

3267
02:26:32,440 --> 02:26:34,440
Oh, God, that's insane.

3268
02:26:35,440 --> 02:26:37,440
Thank you, all by Isaac.

3269
02:26:37,440 --> 02:26:39,440
Small loan of a million dollars?

3270
02:26:39,440 --> 02:26:40,440
Exactly.

3271
02:26:40,440 --> 02:26:41,440
Yeah, okay.

3272
02:26:41,440 --> 02:26:43,440
Delirium was next to the secret room,

3273
02:26:43,440 --> 02:26:45,440
which is very curious.

3274
02:26:46,440 --> 02:26:50,440
Now, thankfully we do have lost contact,

3275
02:26:50,440 --> 02:26:51,440
but Delirium...

3276
02:26:51,440 --> 02:26:53,440
Now, Edmick Muffin...

3277
02:26:53,440 --> 02:26:54,440
Who goes there?

3278
02:27:05,440 --> 02:27:07,440
I mean, that sounds like a deal to me.

3279
02:27:08,440 --> 02:27:10,440
Thank you, tiny spiny.

3280
02:27:10,440 --> 02:27:12,440
Oh, I just lost my holy mantle.

3281
02:27:12,440 --> 02:27:14,440
Oh, no, I lost holy mantle and my blanket.

3282
02:27:14,440 --> 02:27:16,440
I actually had two because I'm just so good at the game.

3283
02:27:17,440 --> 02:27:18,440
Hold on.

3284
02:27:18,440 --> 02:27:20,440
I'm MLG pro-gaming.

3285
02:27:20,440 --> 02:27:21,440
I'm not owl.

3286
02:27:21,440 --> 02:27:23,440
I'm not even looking at the screen.

3287
02:27:23,440 --> 02:27:24,440
I'm cheating.

3288
02:27:27,440 --> 02:27:28,440
Wah!

3289
02:27:28,440 --> 02:27:29,440
It's ogre.

3290
02:27:30,440 --> 02:27:31,440
We're dead.

3291
02:27:34,440 --> 02:27:35,440
We did it!

3292
02:27:35,440 --> 02:27:37,440
We did Delirium.

3293
02:27:37,440 --> 02:27:38,440
Wee!

3294
02:27:40,440 --> 02:27:41,440
Oh, Parisic.

3295
02:27:46,440 --> 02:27:48,440
Are you squiddin' me right now?

3296
02:27:56,440 --> 02:27:57,440
Oh, I like that.

3297
02:27:57,440 --> 02:27:58,440
Hold on.

3298
02:27:59,440 --> 02:28:02,440
No, I like that because I can information dump on Isaac

3299
02:28:02,440 --> 02:28:03,440
and be like,

3300
02:28:03,440 --> 02:28:05,440
Thank you so much for getting me rock bottom.

3301
02:28:09,440 --> 02:28:11,440
Thank you so much for getting me rock bottom.

3302
02:28:11,440 --> 02:28:13,440
I need to return the favor now.

3303
02:28:16,440 --> 02:28:21,440
Isaac, my boy.

3304
02:28:21,440 --> 02:28:22,440
There he is.

3305
02:28:22,440 --> 02:28:23,440
We scale it in.

3306
02:28:23,440 --> 02:28:25,440
Look at his repel this.

3307
02:28:26,440 --> 02:28:28,440
His wee hip bones are jutting out.

3308
02:28:28,440 --> 02:28:30,440
Thank you, Anonymous, for the suggestion.

3309
02:28:30,440 --> 02:28:31,440
Thank you.

3310
02:28:31,440 --> 02:28:32,440
That is my concept now.

3311
02:28:32,440 --> 02:28:34,440
I now own the legal rights to that idea,

3312
02:28:34,440 --> 02:28:36,440
and no one else is allowed to do it.

3313
02:28:36,440 --> 02:28:38,440
Copyright holder, scrawny culls.

3314
02:28:38,440 --> 02:28:48,440
More like rockin' your bottom.

3315
02:28:48,440 --> 02:28:50,440
So that's dad walkin' away on the hill, rip dad.

3316
02:28:52,440 --> 02:28:54,440
He's walking away forever.

3317
02:28:56,440 --> 02:28:57,440
That was it.

3318
02:28:57,440 --> 02:29:00,440
That's the binding of Isaac repentance team.

3319
02:29:02,440 --> 02:29:04,440
Poor Isaacers, honestly.

3320
02:29:04,440 --> 02:29:07,440
Get her rock bottom so she can go down to your rock.

3321
02:29:08,440 --> 02:29:12,440
How long still until scrawny plays Roblox?

3322
02:29:12,440 --> 02:29:13,440
I've never played Roblox.

3323
02:29:13,440 --> 02:29:15,440
Now, I will say one thing.

3324
02:29:15,440 --> 02:29:17,440
I saw the funniest TikTok,

3325
02:29:17,440 --> 02:29:20,440
and it was like Roblox jumping course,

3326
02:29:20,440 --> 02:29:24,440
but you only jump by your mic getting activated,

3327
02:29:24,440 --> 02:29:25,440
and I was like,

3328
02:29:25,440 --> 02:29:29,440
could you imagine the noises all six of us would make on Roblox?

3329
02:29:29,440 --> 02:29:30,440
Being like,

3330
02:29:30,440 --> 02:29:33,440
whoa, whoa, like trying to get the mic to activate.

3331
02:29:33,440 --> 02:29:36,440
It would be absolutely a zoomer,

3332
02:29:36,440 --> 02:29:37,440
but she's never played Roblox.

3333
02:29:37,440 --> 02:29:40,440
Right, I'm gonna say something controversial,

3334
02:29:40,440 --> 02:29:45,440
but does Roblox no give you absolute five-year-old vibes?

3335
02:29:45,440 --> 02:29:47,440
I've seen people roleplay as a cashier

3336
02:29:47,440 --> 02:29:48,440
in a hairdresser in Roblox,

3337
02:29:48,440 --> 02:29:49,440
and I'm like,

3338
02:29:49,440 --> 02:29:51,440
I think this game's from the younger,

3339
02:29:51,440 --> 02:29:54,440
young, young, youngins, you know?

3340
02:29:54,440 --> 02:29:56,440
The ending song hunts my nerves.

3341
02:29:56,440 --> 02:29:58,440
Jesus loves you.

3342
02:30:00,440 --> 02:30:03,440
That's good, but the louder you scream, the higher you jump.

3343
02:30:03,440 --> 02:30:04,440
Roblox is like a kiddie game, I swear.

3344
02:30:04,440 --> 02:30:06,440
Yeah, it's like younger, zoomer.

3345
02:30:06,440 --> 02:30:09,440
Bro, it looks like it's for five-year-olds

3346
02:30:09,440 --> 02:30:11,440
that if they would get their first game,

3347
02:30:11,440 --> 02:30:13,440
I feel like that stream would get demonetized.

3348
02:30:13,440 --> 02:30:16,440
But anyway, this is my save file,

3349
02:30:16,440 --> 02:30:20,440
so for my tainted characters,

3350
02:30:20,440 --> 02:30:23,440
I've got tainted Isaac, Madeline, Cain,

3351
02:30:23,440 --> 02:30:24,440
but as you can see,

3352
02:30:24,440 --> 02:30:29,440
I have hardly achieved much and tainted.

3353
02:30:31,440 --> 02:30:33,440
Oh, it almost gets me like,

3354
02:30:33,440 --> 02:30:35,440
that's where Dad's singing to us.

3355
02:30:37,440 --> 02:30:38,440
But I've done Greed Mode.

3356
02:30:38,440 --> 02:30:40,440
I really like Greed Ear and Greed Mode.

3357
02:30:40,440 --> 02:30:43,440
I know a lot of people hate it, I don't mind it,

3358
02:30:43,440 --> 02:30:46,440
but there are quite a few that I haven't done.

3359
02:30:46,440 --> 02:30:49,440
Like, I've not unlocked Tainted Eden.

3360
02:30:49,440 --> 02:30:51,440
Lost, yeah, surprise, surprise,

3361
02:30:51,440 --> 02:30:53,440
I haven't got much about that.

3362
02:30:53,440 --> 02:30:55,440
What about the death penalty?

3363
02:30:55,440 --> 02:30:58,440
Lilith, Keeper, Polly on,

3364
02:30:58,440 --> 02:31:01,440
The Forgotten, Bethany,

3365
02:31:02,440 --> 02:31:04,440
Jacob is locked, I've not unlocked him,

3366
02:31:04,440 --> 02:31:07,440
but yeah, my tainted isn't very good.

3367
02:31:07,440 --> 02:31:10,440
Greed Mode, hey, taking Lilith to Greed Mode.

3368
02:31:10,440 --> 02:31:13,440
I don't know, what's for your tainted version?

3369
02:31:13,440 --> 02:31:16,440
Betrayal, Fetal Fury, and Jello.

3370
02:31:16,440 --> 02:31:18,440
Jello's pretty strong.

3371
02:31:19,440 --> 02:31:20,440
Jello's a strong ba-ba.

3372
02:31:20,440 --> 02:31:23,440
Jello has ult lock as well, if I'm not mistaken.

3373
02:31:23,440 --> 02:31:26,440
What, do you want to try a Greed on Lilith?

3374
02:31:27,440 --> 02:31:28,440
We can try it.

3375
02:31:28,440 --> 02:31:31,440
I don't expect to win, but we'll try it.

3376
02:31:31,440 --> 02:31:34,440
I always feel like clearing my safe and starting all over again

3377
02:31:34,440 --> 02:31:35,440
when I watch streams of this game.

3378
02:31:35,440 --> 02:31:37,440
Are you a god?

3379
02:31:39,440 --> 02:31:40,440
Oh wait, no!

3380
02:31:40,440 --> 02:31:43,440
I thought it was going to be Jello as an active item.

3381
02:31:43,440 --> 02:31:45,440
Oh no.

3382
02:31:45,440 --> 02:31:48,440
We are not making it out with this one, Chief.

3383
02:31:49,440 --> 02:31:52,440
Look how slow I am, I'm so sluggish.

3384
02:31:54,440 --> 02:31:56,440
Yeah, we're not making it alive.

3385
02:31:56,440 --> 02:31:59,440
Oh, we have lucky, oh wait, you don't get pills,

3386
02:31:59,440 --> 02:32:01,440
you need bi-pills in this game.

3387
02:32:02,440 --> 02:32:03,440
Ooh, it's not happening.

3388
02:32:03,440 --> 02:32:06,440
Thank you Anonymous for the tip again if I didn't say thank you,

3389
02:32:06,440 --> 02:32:09,440
because all I said was stealing your idea.

3390
02:32:09,440 --> 02:32:12,440
You have Honing and a Whip that does three times damage.

3391
02:32:14,440 --> 02:32:17,440
I mean, if it has Honing, there's a chance.

3392
02:32:18,440 --> 02:32:22,440
If it has Honing, come on Jello, if we can get BFF

3393
02:32:23,440 --> 02:32:25,440
in Treasure Box, I assume.

3394
02:32:25,440 --> 02:32:27,440
Oh my god, look at the...

3395
02:32:28,440 --> 02:32:29,440
Go Jello!

3396
02:32:29,440 --> 02:32:31,440
Keep me safe down here.

3397
02:32:32,440 --> 02:32:34,440
Wow, there's jobbies.

3398
02:32:37,440 --> 02:32:40,440
But I do not suspect I will win,

3399
02:32:40,440 --> 02:32:42,440
but that's not going to stop us, is it?

3400
02:32:43,440 --> 02:32:45,440
Come on Jello.

3401
02:32:45,440 --> 02:32:47,440
With that aimbot, come on Jello with that aimbot.

3402
02:32:47,440 --> 02:32:48,440
Hit him with it.

3403
02:32:49,440 --> 02:32:51,440
Don't shoot, just whip.

3404
02:32:51,440 --> 02:32:52,440
Oh no.

3405
02:32:52,440 --> 02:32:54,440
Wait, are you sure?

3406
02:32:55,440 --> 02:32:56,440
Oh.

3407
02:32:58,440 --> 02:32:59,440
Oh my god.

3408
02:33:00,440 --> 02:33:01,440
Oh, you're so right.

3409
02:33:01,440 --> 02:33:02,440
Wait, what hit me?

3410
02:33:02,440 --> 02:33:03,440
I don't know what hit me.

3411
02:33:03,440 --> 02:33:04,440
Something got me, I don't know what it was,

3412
02:33:04,440 --> 02:33:06,440
but I guess I deserved it.

3413
02:33:08,440 --> 02:33:09,440
Oh my gosh.

3414
02:33:09,440 --> 02:33:11,440
Hit him with it, whip.

3415
02:33:11,440 --> 02:33:13,440
Now watch me whip.

3416
02:33:13,440 --> 02:33:15,440
Now watch me, that must have been made so many times

3417
02:33:15,440 --> 02:33:17,440
considering how old this game is.

3418
02:33:18,440 --> 02:33:20,440
Yeah, dang.

3419
02:33:20,440 --> 02:33:22,440
I'm so slow though.

3420
02:33:22,440 --> 02:33:24,440
0.85 movement speed.

3421
02:33:25,440 --> 02:33:27,440
I'm late, but I still made it.

3422
02:33:27,440 --> 02:33:30,440
You're lucky I was fatigued enough to

3423
02:33:30,440 --> 02:33:32,440
commit to this game mode.

3424
02:33:32,440 --> 02:33:33,440
I thought I was going to have my

3425
02:33:33,440 --> 02:33:35,440
freaking treasure box

3426
02:33:35,440 --> 02:33:36,440
thinking my bobber, but I don't.

3427
02:33:36,440 --> 02:33:38,440
I've forgotten what Feetal Fury was

3428
02:33:38,440 --> 02:33:40,440
or what my passenger was.

3429
02:33:41,440 --> 02:33:43,440
Is that the tummy thing?

3430
02:33:44,440 --> 02:33:46,440
I am whipping the crap out of this thing.

3431
02:33:47,440 --> 02:33:48,440
Wah.

3432
02:33:49,440 --> 02:33:50,440
Whoa.

3433
02:33:50,440 --> 02:33:51,440
Juke.

3434
02:33:51,440 --> 02:33:52,440
Juke, go away, Juke.

3435
02:33:52,440 --> 02:33:53,440
Go away.

3436
02:33:53,440 --> 02:33:54,440
Go away.

3437
02:33:56,440 --> 02:33:58,440
You have respect, my Paratain.

3438
02:33:58,440 --> 02:34:00,440
Oh my god, I feel like Cartman

3439
02:34:00,440 --> 02:34:01,440
because I'm so slow.

3440
02:34:02,440 --> 02:34:03,440
Okay, one more fight.

3441
02:34:03,440 --> 02:34:05,440
We're going to ignore the devil

3442
02:34:05,440 --> 02:34:06,440
deals.

3443
02:34:06,440 --> 02:34:08,440
We're going to go angel deals.

3444
02:34:10,440 --> 02:34:13,440
Oh wait, can Lilith only get a...

3445
02:34:13,440 --> 02:34:15,440
Oh, well that was very unfortunate.

3446
02:34:15,440 --> 02:34:17,440
Did not mean to lose that.

3447
02:34:17,440 --> 02:34:18,440
Ooh.

3448
02:34:18,440 --> 02:34:19,440
No, I can get angel deals.

3449
02:34:19,440 --> 02:34:20,440
Okay, that's fine.

3450
02:34:22,440 --> 02:34:24,440
We are a puppeteer now.

3451
02:34:24,440 --> 02:34:26,440
I wonder how many even got that

3452
02:34:26,440 --> 02:34:27,440
song reference.

3453
02:34:29,440 --> 02:34:31,440
I feel like that was popular now.

3454
02:34:31,440 --> 02:34:32,440
Watch me whip.

3455
02:34:33,440 --> 02:34:34,440
Watch me now.

3456
02:34:35,440 --> 02:34:36,440
Right.

3457
02:34:39,440 --> 02:34:40,440
These are all pish.

3458
02:34:41,440 --> 02:34:42,440
That can get people.

3459
02:34:43,440 --> 02:34:44,440
I'm probably going to regret this,

3460
02:34:44,440 --> 02:34:45,440
but I'm going to sacrifice...

3461
02:34:48,440 --> 02:34:50,440
That's why I regret it,

3462
02:34:50,440 --> 02:34:52,440
because you need to go in with sugar

3463
02:34:52,440 --> 02:34:54,440
and spice and everything nice.

3464
02:34:56,440 --> 02:34:58,440
Right, we'll take our monies.

3465
02:34:58,440 --> 02:35:00,440
Oh, I thought Jill could pick up a heart.

3466
02:35:01,440 --> 02:35:02,440
But we cannot.

3467
02:35:03,440 --> 02:35:04,440
Okay, let's go next.

3468
02:35:04,440 --> 02:35:05,440
Let's go next.

3469
02:35:05,440 --> 02:35:06,440
Let's not hang around.

3470
02:35:06,440 --> 02:35:08,440
Let's not beat around the bush.

3471
02:35:08,440 --> 02:35:09,440
Any beat-bushers?

3472
02:35:09,440 --> 02:35:10,440
Any bush beaters?

3473
02:35:10,440 --> 02:35:11,440
Sorry, I said it wrong.

3474
02:35:12,440 --> 02:35:14,440
That song was in almost every vine

3475
02:35:14,440 --> 02:35:16,440
bought back in the world store.

3476
02:35:16,440 --> 02:35:17,440
Right, we've got tier rate up,

3477
02:35:17,440 --> 02:35:19,440
so does that mean the whip is faster?

3478
02:35:22,440 --> 02:35:23,440
He's so fast.

3479
02:35:24,440 --> 02:35:25,440
He's such a baby.

3480
02:35:26,440 --> 02:35:28,440
Oh, we've got Haun.

3481
02:35:28,440 --> 02:35:29,440
I like Haun,

3482
02:35:29,440 --> 02:35:31,440
because he goes and does damage on his own.

3483
02:35:31,440 --> 02:35:33,440
Anything that goes away

3484
02:35:33,440 --> 02:35:34,440
and does damage on its own,

3485
02:35:34,440 --> 02:35:35,440
I'm like, are you?

3486
02:35:42,440 --> 02:35:44,440
Yeah, Jello's giving us the range

3487
02:35:44,440 --> 02:35:45,440
to not be attacked.

3488
02:35:46,440 --> 02:35:48,440
Right, pick up the key first

3489
02:35:49,440 --> 02:35:50,440
and then grab Haun,

3490
02:35:50,440 --> 02:35:52,440
because I think Haun's a cutie pie.

3491
02:35:52,440 --> 02:35:53,440
I like Haun,

3492
02:35:53,440 --> 02:35:54,440
because he goes and attacks

3493
02:35:54,440 --> 02:35:55,440
all the enemies for me.

3494
02:35:56,440 --> 02:35:57,440
Are you?

3495
02:35:57,440 --> 02:35:59,440
Wait, how does that work with Jello?

3496
02:36:03,440 --> 02:36:04,440
Oh, he spits out.

3497
02:36:04,440 --> 02:36:06,440
He spits out C-section.

3498
02:36:08,440 --> 02:36:09,440
Oh, my gosh.

3499
02:36:10,440 --> 02:36:11,440
I'm so lucky.

3500
02:36:13,440 --> 02:36:14,440
Oh.

3501
02:36:16,440 --> 02:36:17,440
Oh.

3502
02:36:26,440 --> 02:36:28,440
I'm here for it.

3503
02:36:30,440 --> 02:36:31,440
My yum heart.

3504
02:36:31,440 --> 02:36:32,440
Yum yum.

3505
02:36:33,440 --> 02:36:34,440
I like that.

3506
02:36:34,440 --> 02:36:35,440
Thank you, Anonymous,

3507
02:36:35,440 --> 02:36:37,440
for the suggestion and the tip.

3508
02:36:37,440 --> 02:36:38,440
I need to write all these down.

3509
02:36:38,440 --> 02:36:39,440
I need to get, like, a document,

3510
02:36:39,440 --> 02:36:40,440
because you guys give me

3511
02:36:40,440 --> 02:36:41,440
such good suggestions.

3512
02:36:41,440 --> 02:36:43,440
And I like making content

3513
02:36:43,440 --> 02:36:44,440
that you want to hear

3514
02:36:44,440 --> 02:36:46,440
versus what I think you want to hear.

3515
02:36:46,440 --> 02:36:47,440
Like, I'd rather...

3516
02:36:47,440 --> 02:36:48,440
Oh, my God, Haun is getting it.

3517
02:36:48,440 --> 02:36:49,440
Go, Haun, go.

3518
02:36:49,440 --> 02:36:50,440
Go, Haun, go.

3519
02:36:52,440 --> 02:36:53,440
I'd rather, like,

3520
02:36:53,440 --> 02:36:55,440
feel more confident writing stuff

3521
02:36:55,440 --> 02:36:56,440
that you guys, like, want

3522
02:36:56,440 --> 02:36:58,440
than me guessing that you want.

3523
02:36:58,440 --> 02:37:00,440
I don't know how I didn't get hit there.

3524
02:37:00,440 --> 02:37:01,440
I got...

3525
02:37:03,440 --> 02:37:05,440
Right, we kind of need a bomb.

3526
02:37:09,440 --> 02:37:11,440
Well, that's a bomb, all right.

3527
02:37:11,440 --> 02:37:13,440
That gives us health and a bomb.

3528
02:37:14,440 --> 02:37:15,440
Hmm.

3529
02:37:15,440 --> 02:37:16,440
I think that's...

3530
02:37:16,440 --> 02:37:18,440
Right, I know this seems crazy

3531
02:37:18,440 --> 02:37:20,440
because it doesn't do anything.

3532
02:37:24,440 --> 02:37:26,440
The odds of rolling a bomb

3533
02:37:26,440 --> 02:37:27,440
are terrible.

3534
02:37:27,440 --> 02:37:29,440
At least we have unlimited bomb.

3535
02:37:29,440 --> 02:37:30,440
Ooh!

3536
02:37:30,440 --> 02:37:32,440
That goes pepper's goods.

3537
02:37:32,440 --> 02:37:33,440
Nerd Girlfriend talks

3538
02:37:33,440 --> 02:37:34,440
about Isaac Lowell doing it

3539
02:37:34,440 --> 02:37:35,440
the entire time.

3540
02:37:35,440 --> 02:37:36,440
Well, I really, like,

3541
02:37:36,440 --> 02:37:38,440
I'm surprisingly enjoying it.

3542
02:37:38,440 --> 02:37:39,440
I don't know if you guys

3543
02:37:39,440 --> 02:37:40,440
like that.

3544
02:37:40,440 --> 02:37:42,440
I'm surprisingly enjoyed

3545
02:37:42,440 --> 02:37:43,440
writing Ignore.

3546
02:37:45,440 --> 02:37:47,440
I'm so surprised I liked it

3547
02:37:47,440 --> 02:37:48,440
because...

3548
02:37:48,440 --> 02:37:50,440
But it does, like, have funny things

3549
02:37:50,440 --> 02:37:52,440
where I could, like, be playing a game

3550
02:37:52,440 --> 02:37:53,440
in theory.

3551
02:37:53,440 --> 02:37:54,440
Oh, no, that was terrible.

3552
02:37:54,440 --> 02:37:56,440
Right, I'm not popping this anymore.

3553
02:37:56,440 --> 02:37:58,440
In theory, it could, like,

3554
02:37:58,440 --> 02:38:00,440
lead Rise to me having to carry on

3555
02:38:00,440 --> 02:38:01,440
with things like that.

3556
02:38:03,440 --> 02:38:04,440
Because it is just, like,

3557
02:38:04,440 --> 02:38:05,440
a bit of goofing off.

3558
02:38:06,440 --> 02:38:07,440
And I can be, like,

3559
02:38:07,440 --> 02:38:08,440
Girlfriend's addicted to

3560
02:38:08,440 --> 02:38:10,440
Binding of Isaac while she ignores

3561
02:38:10,440 --> 02:38:11,440
but gives you free use

3562
02:38:11,440 --> 02:38:13,440
ASMR, like, that kind of stuff.

3563
02:38:13,440 --> 02:38:15,440
Oh, I'm too slow!

3564
02:38:15,440 --> 02:38:17,440
How did I dodge that?

3565
02:38:19,440 --> 02:38:21,440
I have no idea how I dodged that.

3566
02:38:21,440 --> 02:38:22,440
That is hilarious.

3567
02:38:26,440 --> 02:38:27,440
That was...

3568
02:38:27,440 --> 02:38:29,440
I have no idea how that just occurred.

3569
02:38:31,440 --> 02:38:32,440
I know I should be whipping,

3570
02:38:32,440 --> 02:38:34,440
but I'm terrible, okay?

3571
02:38:35,440 --> 02:38:37,440
We're gonna blow up an angel.

3572
02:38:37,440 --> 02:38:38,440
That sounds terrible.

3573
02:38:45,440 --> 02:38:46,440
Okay, and then next...

3574
02:38:49,440 --> 02:38:50,440
Okay.

3575
02:38:50,440 --> 02:38:51,440
Oh, and we got a frickin'

3576
02:38:52,440 --> 02:38:54,440
and it's fearin' him!

3577
02:38:55,440 --> 02:38:56,440
Come on!

3578
02:38:57,440 --> 02:38:58,440
This is so good.

3579
02:38:58,440 --> 02:39:00,440
And we can sacrifice health

3580
02:39:00,440 --> 02:39:02,440
to get a bomb if we need a type thing.

3581
02:39:05,440 --> 02:39:06,440
Very nice.

3582
02:39:08,440 --> 02:39:09,440
Let me read the

3583
02:39:10,440 --> 02:39:11,440
suggestion again.

3584
02:39:21,440 --> 02:39:22,440
Ooh, baby.

3585
02:39:23,440 --> 02:39:25,440
Man, I've been an MVP, literally.

3586
02:39:27,440 --> 02:39:28,440
Casually just

3587
02:39:28,440 --> 02:39:29,440
Morgan everything.

3588
02:39:29,440 --> 02:39:30,440
Right.

3589
02:39:30,440 --> 02:39:31,440
I

3590
02:39:31,440 --> 02:39:32,440
can now go into the

3591
02:39:32,440 --> 02:39:34,440
curse rooms without any issues.

3592
02:39:36,440 --> 02:39:39,440
Some issues with the curse rooms.

3593
02:39:39,440 --> 02:39:41,440
I'm so slow!

3594
02:39:41,440 --> 02:39:43,440
Please, no more bombs.

3595
02:39:43,440 --> 02:39:45,440
No, I'm so slow!

3596
02:39:45,440 --> 02:39:47,440
That's what I didn't want.

3597
02:39:48,440 --> 02:39:49,440
And it happened anyway

3598
02:39:49,440 --> 02:39:51,440
because I'm too frickin' slow.

3599
02:39:53,440 --> 02:39:54,440
Now...

3600
02:39:56,440 --> 02:39:58,440
That's really good.

3601
02:39:59,440 --> 02:40:00,440
I'm gonna take it.

3602
02:40:00,440 --> 02:40:01,440
I know I probably shouldn't,

3603
02:40:01,440 --> 02:40:03,440
but that's really good.

3604
02:40:03,440 --> 02:40:06,440
Now, I can blow up

3605
02:40:07,440 --> 02:40:08,440
like that.

3606
02:40:09,440 --> 02:40:10,440
Yeah.

3607
02:40:11,440 --> 02:40:12,440
Okay, that's good.

3608
02:40:12,440 --> 02:40:13,440
I'll take the penny.

3609
02:40:14,440 --> 02:40:15,440
In for a penny,

3610
02:40:15,440 --> 02:40:16,440
in for a pound.

3611
02:40:17,440 --> 02:40:18,440
Your mama.

3612
02:40:18,440 --> 02:40:20,440
We are gonna blow him up as well.

3613
02:40:21,440 --> 02:40:22,440
As I said, now that we can

3614
02:40:22,440 --> 02:40:24,440
kind of sacrifice Red Heart

3615
02:40:24,440 --> 02:40:25,440
for that.

3616
02:40:25,440 --> 02:40:26,440
Strony a snail.

3617
02:40:26,440 --> 02:40:27,440
Honestly, snail confirmed for Jinto

3618
02:40:27,440 --> 02:40:28,440
because that was

3619
02:40:28,440 --> 02:40:30,440
absolute slow poke territory.

3620
02:40:30,440 --> 02:40:31,440
That was awful.

3621
02:40:33,440 --> 02:40:34,440
I mean...

3622
02:40:35,440 --> 02:40:36,440
We could maybe do one attempt

3623
02:40:36,440 --> 02:40:38,440
at the secret room.

3624
02:40:43,440 --> 02:40:44,440
Okay, that was lucky

3625
02:40:44,440 --> 02:40:45,440
because, yeah,

3626
02:40:45,440 --> 02:40:47,440
I only had one chance.

3627
02:40:47,440 --> 02:40:48,440
Can you hypnotize me

3628
02:40:48,440 --> 02:40:50,440
to finally stop procrastinating?

3629
02:40:50,440 --> 02:40:51,440
That one's out of my

3630
02:40:51,440 --> 02:40:52,440
experience level, chief.

3631
02:40:52,440 --> 02:40:53,440
I'm afraid you're on your own

3632
02:40:53,440 --> 02:40:54,440
for that one.

3633
02:40:54,440 --> 02:40:55,440
I don't...

3634
02:40:58,440 --> 02:41:00,440
It's happening again!

3635
02:41:00,440 --> 02:41:02,440
It's happening again!

3636
02:41:02,440 --> 02:41:03,440
It's happening again!

3637
02:41:06,440 --> 02:41:07,440
Oh, my lord.

3638
02:41:08,440 --> 02:41:10,440
Oh, my lord.

3639
02:41:10,440 --> 02:41:12,440
It's happening again!

3640
02:41:13,440 --> 02:41:14,440
It's happening again.

3641
02:41:14,440 --> 02:41:15,440
Okay.

3642
02:41:15,440 --> 02:41:17,440
We now have a panic button.

3643
02:41:17,440 --> 02:41:19,440
We have a panic button.

3644
02:41:19,440 --> 02:41:21,440
I repeat, we have a panic button.

3645
02:41:22,440 --> 02:41:24,440
We're going to go as far as we can.

3646
02:41:24,440 --> 02:41:25,440
But...

3647
02:41:26,440 --> 02:41:27,440
Yeah.

3648
02:41:28,440 --> 02:41:29,440
We've got Curse of Darkness,

3649
02:41:29,440 --> 02:41:30,440
which is a shame.

3650
02:41:33,440 --> 02:41:34,440
Um...

3651
02:41:34,440 --> 02:41:35,440
But we've...

3652
02:41:36,440 --> 02:41:37,440
Okay, okay, hold on.

3653
02:41:39,440 --> 02:41:40,440
Let him get up.

3654
02:41:40,440 --> 02:41:42,440
Can you grab that for me?

3655
02:41:42,440 --> 02:41:43,440
Jello, bring it...

3656
02:41:43,440 --> 02:41:44,440
Jello, bring it over.

3657
02:41:44,440 --> 02:41:46,440
Jello, bring it over.

3658
02:41:48,440 --> 02:41:49,440
Right.

3659
02:41:49,440 --> 02:41:52,440
I am going to get that key.

3660
02:41:52,440 --> 02:41:53,440
I'm just going to go and

3661
02:41:53,440 --> 02:41:54,440
explode for it.

3662
02:41:55,440 --> 02:41:56,440
Um...

3663
02:41:57,440 --> 02:41:58,440
Well, we can maybe get a chance

3664
02:41:58,440 --> 02:41:59,440
to get the secret room,

3665
02:41:59,440 --> 02:42:01,440
which is exactly what I was hoping there.

3666
02:42:03,440 --> 02:42:04,440
Huh?

3667
02:42:06,440 --> 02:42:08,440
Two back-to-back...

3668
02:42:08,440 --> 02:42:09,440
No, that can't be...

3669
02:42:10,440 --> 02:42:13,440
My code is QQ3G80R2.

3670
02:42:14,440 --> 02:42:15,440
We can't have both.

3671
02:42:15,440 --> 02:42:16,440
No, we can't.

3672
02:42:16,440 --> 02:42:18,440
I'm keeping the R key.

3673
02:42:19,440 --> 02:42:20,440
Um...

3674
02:42:21,440 --> 02:42:22,440
Where are you?

3675
02:42:22,440 --> 02:42:23,440
Large orbital, the block shot.

3676
02:42:23,440 --> 02:42:25,440
It splits into smaller versions.

3677
02:42:25,440 --> 02:42:26,440
The smaller version breaking

3678
02:42:26,440 --> 02:42:27,440
into blocks.

3679
02:42:27,440 --> 02:42:28,440
I'm just going to go and

3680
02:42:28,440 --> 02:42:29,440
explode for it.

3681
02:42:29,440 --> 02:42:30,440
It splits into smaller versions.

3682
02:42:30,440 --> 02:42:31,440
The smaller version breaking

3683
02:42:31,440 --> 02:42:32,440
into blue spiders.

3684
02:42:32,440 --> 02:42:33,440
Respawn.

3685
02:42:33,440 --> 02:42:34,440
Okay, so kind of just

3686
02:42:34,440 --> 02:42:35,440
spider, spider.

3687
02:42:35,440 --> 02:42:36,440
Rider, rider.

3688
02:42:36,440 --> 02:42:37,440
We're going to...

3689
02:42:37,440 --> 02:42:38,440
We're going to go for it.

3690
02:42:38,440 --> 02:42:39,440
We do have a...

3691
02:42:39,440 --> 02:42:40,440
We can bomb the angel.

3692
02:42:40,440 --> 02:42:41,440
If we get an angel,

3693
02:42:41,440 --> 02:42:42,440
then we can get 100% angel deals.

3694
02:42:42,440 --> 02:42:43,440
So we don't have to sacrifice

3695
02:42:43,440 --> 02:42:45,440
any health for any of those

3696
02:42:45,440 --> 02:42:46,440
good things.

3697
02:42:47,440 --> 02:42:49,440
Oh, I'm too slow for this.

3698
02:42:49,440 --> 02:42:51,440
I am too slow for this.

3699
02:42:53,440 --> 02:42:54,440
We do have a chance

3700
02:42:54,440 --> 02:42:56,440
for blue smoke as well,

3701
02:42:56,440 --> 02:42:58,440
which is good.

3702
02:42:59,440 --> 02:43:02,440
I'm going to pick up our weak lines.

3703
02:43:03,440 --> 02:43:04,440
Streamer luck.

3704
02:43:04,440 --> 02:43:06,440
Actual streamer luck though.

3705
02:43:11,440 --> 02:43:13,440
Actual streamer luck though.

3706
02:43:13,440 --> 02:43:14,440
I was like,

3707
02:43:14,440 --> 02:43:15,440
oh, I don't know if I can win this one.

3708
02:43:15,440 --> 02:43:16,440
Well, you know,

3709
02:43:16,440 --> 02:43:18,440
my confidence has gone up a little bit.

3710
02:43:18,440 --> 02:43:19,440
I'm not sure why.

3711
02:43:19,440 --> 02:43:20,440
Totally not because I've got an R key,

3712
02:43:20,440 --> 02:43:22,440
but streamer luck don't mean

3713
02:43:22,440 --> 02:43:23,440
if I do.

3714
02:43:23,440 --> 02:43:24,440
Okay, steady.

3715
02:43:24,440 --> 02:43:26,440
I really do not want to lose

3716
02:43:26,440 --> 02:43:27,440
my holy mantle.

3717
02:43:27,440 --> 02:43:28,440
Although we could just leave

3718
02:43:28,440 --> 02:43:29,440
the room and go again,

3719
02:43:29,440 --> 02:43:30,440
can't we?

3720
02:43:30,440 --> 02:43:31,440
Yeah,

3721
02:43:31,440 --> 02:43:32,440
actually,

3722
02:43:32,440 --> 02:43:33,440
I'm over-complicating things.

3723
02:43:33,440 --> 02:43:34,440
Classic women women.

3724
02:43:34,440 --> 02:43:35,440
Ah,

3725
02:43:35,440 --> 02:43:36,440
where is he?

3726
02:43:36,440 --> 02:43:37,440
I'm just going to let them

3727
02:43:37,440 --> 02:43:38,440
kind of deal with them.

3728
02:43:40,440 --> 02:43:41,440
Are you squidding me right now?

3729
02:43:41,440 --> 02:43:42,440
By the pope.

3730
02:43:43,440 --> 02:43:44,440
I just wanted everyone

3731
02:43:44,440 --> 02:43:45,440
to have a chance to

3732
02:43:45,440 --> 02:43:46,440
have a chance to have a chance

3733
02:43:46,440 --> 02:43:47,440
to have a chance

3734
02:43:47,440 --> 02:43:48,440
to have a chance

3735
02:43:48,440 --> 02:43:49,440
to have a chance

3736
02:43:49,440 --> 02:43:50,440
to have a chance

3737
02:43:50,440 --> 02:43:51,440
to have a chance

3738
02:43:51,440 --> 02:43:52,440
to have a chance to have a chance

3739
02:43:52,440 --> 02:43:53,440
to have a chance to have a chance

3740
02:43:53,440 --> 02:43:54,440
to have a chance

3741
02:43:55,440 --> 02:43:56,440
to have a chance

3742
02:43:56,440 --> 02:43:57,440
to have a chance

3743
02:43:57,440 --> 02:43:58,440
to have a chance

3744
02:43:58,440 --> 02:43:59,440
to have a chance

3745
02:43:59,440 --> 02:44:00,440
to have a chance

3746
02:44:00,440 --> 02:44:01,440
to have a chance

3747
02:44:01,440 --> 02:44:02,440
to have a chance

3748
02:44:02,440 --> 02:44:03,440
to have a chance

3749
02:44:03,440 --> 02:44:04,440
to have a chance

3750
02:44:04,440 --> 02:44:05,440
to have a chance

3751
02:44:05,440 --> 02:44:06,440
to have a chance

3752
02:44:06,440 --> 02:44:07,440
to have a chance

3753
02:44:07,440 --> 02:44:08,440
to have a chance

3754
02:44:08,440 --> 02:44:09,440
to have a chance

3755
02:44:09,440 --> 02:44:10,440
to have a chance

3756
02:44:10,440 --> 02:44:11,440
to have a chance

3757
02:44:11,440 --> 02:44:12,440
to have a chance

3758
02:44:12,440 --> 02:44:13,440
to have a chance

3759
02:44:13,440 --> 02:44:14,440
to have a chance

3760
02:44:17,440 --> 02:44:19,440
to have a chance

3761
02:44:19,440 --> 02:44:26,320
We have a pirate. They're so fast. Oh my god. I shouldn't have done that. Why did I do that?

3762
02:44:27,520 --> 02:44:31,920
They're so fast. I've just cornered myself.

3763
02:44:37,440 --> 02:44:41,200
I need to do this. Oh my gosh.

3764
02:44:44,240 --> 02:44:46,560
Oh my gosh. I don't know how I got away with that.

3765
02:44:47,120 --> 02:44:49,280
This is a scheduled and pre-recorded tip.

3766
02:44:51,120 --> 02:44:55,600
No, it's not. Stop it. People are gonna believe you.

3767
02:44:57,600 --> 02:45:03,760
Thank you Spidey for the tip. Never punish. She hates us. I don't hate you. What the heck?

3768
02:45:04,800 --> 02:45:11,200
I haven't said anything. Right. We've got the key. So now we have 100% angel chances, which is huge.

3769
02:45:11,440 --> 02:45:17,600
We got very lucky there. That could have gone really bad.

3770
02:45:19,920 --> 02:45:24,720
Rather fortunate. You see? Oh, we've got actual bombs this time, so we don't need to keep hurting

3771
02:45:24,720 --> 02:45:35,920
ourselves. Right. No point in deep poke. Wait, hold on. If I'm resetting, is there odds of me getting

3772
02:45:35,920 --> 02:45:46,400
like a rune like Yara or something? Huh. Self-proclaimed Dom keeps foregoing and uses the whip, honestly.

3773
02:45:47,440 --> 02:45:53,840
Right. Because we're gonna reset, this might be worthwhile to pick up. So I'm gonna do it

3774
02:45:53,840 --> 02:45:59,600
against my better judgement. Taking damage has a 50% chance to spawn something. Not necessary,

3775
02:45:59,600 --> 02:46:10,560
so I'm gonna just destroy this. Did you pick up that coin, but you didn't pick up the key?

3776
02:46:15,600 --> 02:46:24,720
I don't know. Nothing's really speaking out to me. I'm gonna just walk away and go next,

3777
02:46:24,720 --> 02:46:33,520
because I'm not really, not really sure, am I? One good shop is all you need to do the infinite dopes.

3778
02:46:35,120 --> 02:46:36,800
She loves this lovely replay.

3779
02:46:40,000 --> 02:46:45,840
Right, we did get the angel deal. Short speed, I'll take it. What's the card? Pickups? They're

3780
02:46:45,840 --> 02:46:54,240
turned into horror. Okay. Here for another NSFW concept. How about a solo audio for Patreon?

3781
02:46:54,240 --> 02:47:00,160
Stromi reads some of the thirsty marshmallows from Reflings and becomes overwhelmed with lust.

3782
02:47:00,160 --> 02:47:06,960
She can't help but to inquire reading the Maros. So Patreon don't allow live recordings,

3783
02:47:07,840 --> 02:47:08,880
but Twitter does.

3784
02:47:12,080 --> 02:47:18,720
I'm very much thinking of doing a menu, which I think you guys will approve of.

3785
02:47:20,880 --> 02:47:27,440
Oh wait, I'm a dumb dumb. I have fire. I can destroy these guys for free if one of them procs a fire.

3786
02:47:28,080 --> 02:47:36,080
Come on fire, fire, fire. Give us fire. That's just what Twitter will do when she got shy, honestly.

3787
02:47:37,920 --> 02:47:47,600
Twitter for the dub, yes. Don't be surprised if you see a lot of Twitter content over in August,

3788
02:47:47,600 --> 02:47:54,480
I will start taking it super duper serious. Wait, okay, wow. I forgot you could do that.

3789
02:47:54,480 --> 02:48:02,080
Right, speed. Now, normally I wouldn't waste my breath on speed, but in this occasion,

3790
02:48:02,240 --> 02:48:08,160
thank you for the tip again. Hey, Stronny, it's me. Type view and aim here. Just here to watch

3791
02:48:08,160 --> 02:48:14,640
my favorite Scottish streamer play. Insert whatever game Stronny's playing today. Good luck and enjoy

3792
02:48:14,640 --> 02:48:22,000
the stream. Love the content. Delete remainder of message. This is DonoScript number 39.

3793
02:48:22,000 --> 02:48:27,200
You know what's even worse? You trolling about with this, you creasing in your little chair. I'm

3794
02:48:27,200 --> 02:48:32,080
about to release a short that's like, this is how much I earn to obviously like show that like

3795
02:48:32,080 --> 02:48:39,200
the other, you know, something to worry about us. AI generated viewer response. Stop. And everyone's

3796
02:48:39,200 --> 02:48:44,560
going to be like, oh, it's an industry plan. She's like faking the numbers or whatever. No one's going

3797
02:48:44,560 --> 02:48:54,400
to believe me. No one's going to believe the numbers when I show them. If our 49201, thank you

3798
02:48:54,400 --> 02:48:58,640
for becoming a member and all the numbers out there in your name. But thanks for becoming a member.

3799
02:49:01,600 --> 02:49:06,080
Insert positive message here. I believe you. Stronny, you're going to have to punish chat.

3800
02:49:06,080 --> 02:49:08,640
Oh, well, you're getting punished because you didn't get nothing for three weeks.

3801
02:49:09,760 --> 02:49:15,120
How's that for punishment? Oh, dear you. Are you squiddin' me right now?

3802
02:49:16,640 --> 02:49:20,400
I've got to go, mum. My phone is at 5%. I'm going to miss you.

3803
02:49:20,400 --> 02:49:27,680
Okay. Thank you for hanging Broly legend. Rip your phone, Barry. 5%. You win as a fellow acoustic.

3804
02:49:27,680 --> 02:49:35,200
I believe you. I can keep for three weeks. Okay. This is the cruelest punishment imaginable.

3805
02:49:35,200 --> 02:49:40,000
Thank you. I can't believe I have to thank you. Thank you. Type Donator name here.

3806
02:49:41,360 --> 02:49:45,760
You're done. Right. I'm going to get the speed so we can actually, you know, not get wrecked and

3807
02:49:45,840 --> 02:49:48,800
decked. Oh, I do love a bit of Damage.

3808
02:49:52,160 --> 02:49:56,640
I'm going to grab a key. We are going to pick up that damage because that is well worth it.

3809
02:49:59,680 --> 02:50:06,160
What are you? Taking damage can make invincible. Oh, and we can huff pills if we happen to unlock

3810
02:50:06,160 --> 02:50:12,640
any. Good luck. Yeah, hope your cargo will not explode. Smile. We have been infiltrated

3811
02:50:12,640 --> 02:50:18,160
by the High Table. We need a purged room of A. Thank you. You could get a Rune Bag at some point.

3812
02:50:18,160 --> 02:50:24,480
That is what I'm hoping for because we're going to have a reset. I'm like, hmm.

3813
02:50:26,720 --> 02:50:31,360
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Back it up, man. Even the pot of speed, I'm still slow.

3814
02:50:32,720 --> 02:50:36,880
I am good. That damage up is certainly going to help with our little C section, but

3815
02:50:37,840 --> 02:50:45,600
these guys do not care. Oh, I hate everything about those guys. Come on, buddy. Okay, thank you.

3816
02:50:48,960 --> 02:50:58,720
Oh, not you. Come on, haunt. Come on. I really need BFF. BFF would be so beneficial right now.

3817
02:51:00,240 --> 02:51:01,600
I'm going to grab these right now.

3818
02:51:02,400 --> 02:51:13,120
Oh, there's a ghost. I actually got him somehow. And I dodged the attack of that guy somehow.

3819
02:51:17,680 --> 02:51:21,120
Well, the pregnancy is more to be followed up with C set. No.

3820
02:51:22,960 --> 02:51:27,360
That artwork should actually be coming through soon. So that's going to be hilarious to write for.

3821
02:51:28,240 --> 02:51:32,000
Actually, oh, dad, I'm going to wait and record. You need to be quiet. Oh, what are you recording?

3822
02:51:33,360 --> 02:51:34,480
Pregnancy smart.

3823
02:51:36,880 --> 02:51:39,280
He's going to be like, what the fuck are the reflins in there?

3824
02:51:42,800 --> 02:51:47,680
He's going to wonder if these are all okay. Okay, we're going to leave the room to get Holy

3825
02:51:47,680 --> 02:51:54,800
Man all activated back again because we did on four. Shouldn't we just lose it there? Why are you so tiny?

3826
02:51:58,080 --> 02:52:08,720
Oh, I'm just spraying my little C sections because they will attach to anything they

3827
02:52:08,720 --> 02:52:17,840
do get hold of. So it's not like bad. Oh, there's explosions. I'm getting them reddish boys ain't

3828
02:52:17,840 --> 02:52:25,040
right, but perfect. Like my mom and dad knew I was a weird kid. So I'm sure they're not even

3829
02:52:25,040 --> 02:52:31,120
surprised about any of the shenanigans I get into these days. There's like, yeah, yeah, that's

3830
02:52:31,120 --> 02:52:31,840
strong. All right.

3831
02:52:39,200 --> 02:52:42,000
Right, we're going to leave. I'm going to pick up damage.

3832
02:52:44,000 --> 02:52:46,960
Health, but short speed down, but tears up.

3833
02:52:47,760 --> 02:52:59,680
No, we deserve better than that refling. Your C section with them having C section on their own

3834
02:52:59,680 --> 02:53:04,800
is horror material and play some weird stuff going on. Funny, you seem there's normal kids out there.

3835
02:53:07,520 --> 02:53:10,880
Oh, I have 71% chance with Anna.

3836
02:53:17,120 --> 02:53:22,320
There's a difference. Oh, that's hilarious. I'm telling them you said that.

3837
02:53:27,200 --> 02:53:32,880
We did not get your daughter pregnant. So that's amazing.

3838
02:53:37,920 --> 02:53:41,760
Sorry, I'm trying not to lose any health. I really don't want to lose fully mental. I think we can

3839
02:53:41,760 --> 02:53:45,200
get another angel deal. Praying it's a good one. Come on, give us

3840
02:53:48,480 --> 02:53:54,400
what is it? Or give us full. Whoa. I don't, I think haunt.

3841
02:53:57,520 --> 02:54:06,880
71% angel deal, by the way. 71% angel deal. You forgot the yet we didn't get your daughter pregnant

3842
02:54:06,880 --> 02:54:14,480
yet. Reflings, you can't say that about the convention. We're getting trouble if you skip.

3843
02:54:15,040 --> 02:54:21,360
I'm skipping. Give me these coins. Give me these coins.

3844
02:54:22,480 --> 02:54:26,800
Right, I'm going to blow up the machine because there's nothing I want in this

3845
02:54:27,520 --> 02:54:35,520
lot. So just blow up. Whoa. Hold on. I'll take Seraphim.

3846
02:54:37,360 --> 02:54:41,120
Yes. Yes, I will. Look at that. Whoa.

3847
02:54:44,400 --> 02:54:46,640
Wait, no one say anything about the convention.

3848
02:54:50,400 --> 02:54:54,160
Okay, I can't grab these coins. No, no, they have to leave.

3849
02:54:54,160 --> 02:55:01,040
Yeah, it's a shame that D6 is getting ignored, but it is what it is.

3850
02:55:01,360 --> 02:55:05,760
A little flower, a little flowery.

3851
02:55:13,600 --> 02:55:17,760
What are we looking at? Range, luck and a soul heart. I will absolutely take it. Are you joking?

3852
02:55:17,760 --> 02:55:21,920
And we could just got five cents from that fire. Not bad at all.

3853
02:55:22,640 --> 02:55:30,800
Are we skinny enough? Are you serious? Okay.

3854
02:55:32,720 --> 02:55:39,840
I need fire to burn these guys. Come on. Come on fire. Oh, and I missed. Okay. Well, I'll try.

3855
02:55:42,480 --> 02:55:49,440
Come on fire. Isaac got pranked. It hurts even though Archie has more value. Yes.

3856
02:55:50,080 --> 02:55:52,000
The reason

3857
02:55:57,840 --> 02:56:02,000
the stream is longer than I thought it would be. Yes, I am slightly addicted to Isaac.

3858
02:56:02,000 --> 02:56:04,800
My pro dad's been up for a while. I'm just getting ignored right now.

3859
02:56:06,000 --> 02:56:13,680
Today we're going to Bunnings, which is the equivalent of being cute. We need to hire a car.

3860
02:56:14,480 --> 02:56:17,760
Go do a car rental because I don't drive. I ride a bike.

3861
02:56:21,440 --> 02:56:33,120
Oh, come on. Bunnings is B and Q in Australia. And I'm picking up sand so my cats can shit in

3862
02:56:33,120 --> 02:56:39,760
a sandbox. This is true. Oh wait, we have neutral pills. Health up and another health up. I don't

3863
02:56:39,760 --> 02:56:52,160
know if I want too many red hearts though. Right, what are you? Sure.

3864
02:56:54,480 --> 02:57:00,640
The stage transition nightmare shows the wrong items in greed mode. That's hilarious.

3865
02:57:01,360 --> 02:57:09,600
Range and tier size. If the C-section babies are big. That's a good thing, right?

3866
02:57:13,520 --> 02:57:18,800
No, so thankfully Bunnings isn't too far away, but that taxi driver was,

3867
02:57:20,160 --> 02:57:25,840
he was on it. He must have been on the sniff or something because that was erratic driving.

3868
02:57:25,840 --> 02:57:30,000
That was horrible. Although I will say one thing about me. It was nice enough to stop on

3869
02:57:30,480 --> 02:57:34,480
the side of the road. Like we were on the fucking highway and I was like blabbering about like,

3870
02:57:34,480 --> 02:57:40,640
oh, I'm going to get my dad's of the airport and all that. And I was like, I'm so sorry.

3871
02:57:40,640 --> 02:57:44,880
I need to be sick. Can we please stop? And he stopped on the highway and you're not supposed to do that.

3872
02:57:49,680 --> 02:57:53,600
How would it be a traditional Scottish ride and all the reef links and kick kills?

3873
02:57:53,600 --> 02:57:59,520
Yes, that's when you wear kills that way. The booger sugar, that's such a good way to call it.

3874
02:57:59,920 --> 02:58:04,800
Tier size. I think we'll do tier size up. Why not? I don't really want anything else.

3875
02:58:05,600 --> 02:58:08,880
We will pick up the- Are you squidding me right now?

3876
02:58:10,320 --> 02:58:15,840
No wonder those cheeks be clapping like crazy. You'll be working them thighs every day on the

3877
02:58:15,840 --> 02:58:23,440
bike. Yeah, I ride a bike. I love my bike. I think riding bikes are cool. I may not be killed for you.

3878
02:58:24,400 --> 02:58:28,800
Wait, what did you say at the end? I never heard it. What did he say? What did you say?

3879
02:58:30,480 --> 02:58:36,560
I can't read it because I'm freaking in mid-match. I don't want to get whipped,

3880
02:58:36,560 --> 02:58:40,880
but I'm pretty sure that I couldn't hear the end of it because I'm freaking trying to game.

3881
02:58:41,600 --> 02:58:45,520
Okay, we're definitely leaving to get Holy Mantle back. I've messed up this one so badly.

3882
02:58:48,880 --> 02:58:51,280
Hold on. You get a spank in a minute.

3883
02:58:51,600 --> 02:59:05,200
Oh, jeez, Louise. Come on, haunt. Take them on, haunt. Replay the voiceler. No wonder those

3884
02:59:05,200 --> 02:59:11,040
cheeks be sitting on my face and letting me beat you. Wow, refling, that was so direct. I thought

3885
02:59:11,040 --> 02:59:15,760
you were supposed to be shy. I'm supposed to be my shy little boys, but you're not. You're feeling

3886
02:59:15,760 --> 02:59:26,960
it today. Oh my god. Techpoint 5? Scottish culture. Doms, fanboys. Why are there so many people

3887
02:59:26,960 --> 02:59:34,640
trying to make me wear a skirt? No, we don't. It's traditional. I guess meme done so much like,

3888
02:59:34,640 --> 02:59:38,720
oh, it's got people wearing skirt. All right, what are you going to do? Shoot yourself? Sheesh.

3889
02:59:44,480 --> 02:59:53,440
Oh, more damage. Yeah, we'll take it. More damage. All the damage. Right, we've got Holy Mantle back.

3890
02:59:57,760 --> 03:00:02,560
Oh my god. Wait, so the tears are coming from my tummy, but the shots are coming from the end

3891
03:00:02,640 --> 03:00:09,440
of Jell-O. That is very curious. Come on, haunt, and Jell-O.

3892
03:00:12,240 --> 03:00:19,840
Ow, my mantle. You suck. Give me it back. Thank you for the tip, anonymous. If I didn't say thank

3893
03:00:19,840 --> 03:00:25,840
you, I'm so sorry. I'm getting distracted. I, for one, accept my kill future. Strani, please

3894
03:00:25,840 --> 03:00:30,320
make an emote for a reflim wearing a kill. I will. Is that what you want? Because I think I have a

3895
03:00:30,320 --> 03:00:35,920
few more spots left. Haunt, just having them in the corner. Oh, I'm going to hurt myself by accident.

3896
03:00:43,200 --> 03:00:44,400
Are you serious right now?

3897
03:00:52,800 --> 03:00:56,080
Converse all heart containers into black hearts. Oh, sure.

3898
03:00:56,400 --> 03:00:59,520
Is that, then?

3899
03:01:02,800 --> 03:01:11,200
Getting trolled. Pretty fly. For a white guy. Yeah. If we're doing a reset,

3900
03:01:11,200 --> 03:01:15,360
might as well not. Well, I'll grab this pill, then. Change my mind. I want it.

3901
03:01:17,760 --> 03:01:20,560
Hill. Up. Getting trolled by this game.

3902
03:01:21,040 --> 03:01:28,000
Someone else that says damage. I think it's a gamer term. No, is it not?

3903
03:01:31,520 --> 03:01:33,680
Oh, I see it. A tinted rock.

3904
03:01:37,520 --> 03:01:40,480
Yay. I'll pop this.

3905
03:01:40,480 --> 03:01:49,440
Uh, right. We've got the high priestess card.

3906
03:01:51,440 --> 03:01:55,760
Wearing a kill means fresh air down there. No smoke path. Yeah, you're not supposed to wear underwear

3907
03:01:55,760 --> 03:02:06,240
with a kill. Okay, we'll play this one and then we hit reset after it. Or do we actually do the

3908
03:02:06,240 --> 03:02:13,600
boss fight and then hit reset? I feel like we still could have got, whoa, guppers.

3909
03:02:14,240 --> 03:02:17,600
Well, not quite guppers, but you know what I mean. It's collar.

3910
03:02:20,160 --> 03:02:27,120
Oh, you can just skip this floor? I'm not sure about that. Oh, no, there's no re-roll. I hate

3911
03:02:27,120 --> 03:02:31,120
when they have no re-roll. Well, we're going to blow this up anyway, so we might as well take

3912
03:02:31,200 --> 03:02:38,080
over to the guys and save ourselves some time trying to get that thing to pop its clogs.

3913
03:02:39,040 --> 03:02:44,320
Two out of three for guppers though. Bunk. Oh, under.

3914
03:02:49,440 --> 03:02:57,040
D20 can re-roll the... No, I don't want to. Maybe you can find two here. Well, I was just going to

3915
03:02:57,040 --> 03:03:02,240
reset. I don't want to buy anything on this floor, so maybe we just play it and then reset.

3916
03:03:05,520 --> 03:03:12,320
I was hoping to be a bit stronger in all honesty at this point, but we're not really...

3917
03:03:16,160 --> 03:03:20,000
Oh, no, I have Hungie. I'm a Hungie boy.

3918
03:03:20,720 --> 03:03:28,960
I will... Tonight, I'm having Steak, and my dad's cooking it, and he's cooking it well done,

3919
03:03:28,960 --> 03:03:35,040
and I will not have any slander against well-done Steaks. It's okay to be wrong sometimes,

3920
03:03:35,040 --> 03:03:44,000
Reeflings. It's okay to be wrong. Oh, we can actually proc all those guys for coin drops.

3921
03:03:44,000 --> 03:03:49,280
Purly. Thank you for becoming a member. I hope you're not Purly though. I hope you are in good

3922
03:03:49,280 --> 03:03:54,880
health and have long prosperity. Live long and prosper, smile. Whoa, wait, what was that? There's

3923
03:03:54,880 --> 03:04:02,960
something in front of me. I never even saw him. Okay, let's... Yeah, let's burn...

3924
03:04:06,080 --> 03:04:14,400
Yes, one more, and then we'll go out and get Holy Mantle. Come on, you want to give me the flame?

3925
03:04:14,400 --> 03:04:20,960
There we go. Okay, spider's lovely. Bright woman needs immediate... medium steak correction. Also,

3926
03:04:20,960 --> 03:04:25,040
respect for being a cyclist. I'm too scared to learn how to drive a car because I have terrible

3927
03:04:25,040 --> 03:04:33,360
perception, and really, I am pretty certain that I would cause a collision of some kind. I don't

3928
03:04:33,360 --> 03:04:39,840
know what kind. Most likely, a roundabout. Like, if I was gonna go, but the person in front of me

3929
03:04:39,840 --> 03:04:46,880
didn't go, I'd just, like, rear-end them a roundabout. I don't... I do not trust my perception, so...

3930
03:04:46,880 --> 03:04:54,880
Yeah, my next is riding a bike, but I've always rode a bike. I love my bike, and it's fun, and I

3931
03:04:54,880 --> 03:05:01,680
enjoy it, and I know it's kind of... I don't know, not nerdy, but, like, I know everyone kind of drives.

3932
03:05:03,520 --> 03:05:09,200
Okay, we're gonna take the devil's deal, and then we're gonna reset the question mark. Maybe,

3933
03:05:09,200 --> 03:05:14,960
I don't know. Or maybe do the fight that's below. There is a fight that's below.

3934
03:05:17,840 --> 03:05:26,480
Taking 15 spawns a permanent demon after 30... what? Caps up four familiars total. Should

3935
03:05:26,480 --> 03:05:30,080
grab it, and then, sure, just grab that. While we're at it, might as well just take everything.

3936
03:05:30,640 --> 03:05:41,840
All right, we do have 45 coins. Can I... please? Thank you. Thank you! Money, money, money.

3937
03:05:43,040 --> 03:05:48,560
I never drive. I'm too fear of it, honestly. I know, like, it's kind of one of those things where

3938
03:05:48,560 --> 03:05:52,560
it's like, you know what your limits are? It means, like, yeah, I do not have the perception to be able

3939
03:05:52,560 --> 03:05:57,440
to drive. I wonder if self-driving cars would change anything. I think you still need to be

3940
03:05:57,440 --> 03:06:02,240
able to actually drive, but, like, the license... go license for that. Also, thank you, Anonymous,

3941
03:06:02,240 --> 03:06:08,880
for asking to be my bike seat, if I didn't say thank you. In case I was too distracted.

3942
03:06:11,280 --> 03:06:20,480
Okay. We might be able to just straight up... oh. Okay. Thank goodness we didn't do that. We almost

3943
03:06:20,480 --> 03:06:27,680
skipped steam sail. All right, come on. Come on, flames, you can do it. I wish I didn't have to

3944
03:06:27,680 --> 03:06:37,280
drive. Cycling's so fun, because you get to appreciate the nature and so... reset now or do the fight.

3945
03:06:41,040 --> 03:06:44,720
Because I can always reset after the fight. Right, if I'm getting hammered in the fight,

3946
03:06:44,720 --> 03:06:53,840
I'll just reset if I'm getting hammered. I'll reset. I definitely could have more damage.

3947
03:06:57,360 --> 03:06:58,640
About 10% of the way.

3948
03:07:05,040 --> 03:07:07,120
I mean, because the C-section is locking.

3949
03:07:07,120 --> 03:07:19,440
Okay. Okay. Oh, there's a penny. You ain't mine now. I mean, 60% maybe?

3950
03:07:26,640 --> 03:07:31,360
Okay. What are we doing? Health? Right. I'm not giving too much health back.

3951
03:07:31,360 --> 03:07:41,360
All right. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Okay, 50%. We will reset. There is another round after this.

3952
03:07:43,920 --> 03:07:47,280
All right. I think we can get... Come on, haunt. You're doing it all, buddy.

3953
03:07:49,360 --> 03:07:54,480
We didn't get BFF, but we might be able to roll for it. I don't know why the flames are going in

3954
03:07:54,480 --> 03:08:06,320
such random direction. Gento. Okay, we did it. I'm feeling confident now. I think we did it.

3955
03:08:09,360 --> 03:08:12,400
I was worried we didn't actually roll. We've got it. We got it.

3956
03:08:13,600 --> 03:08:19,120
It's okay to be nervous and sometimes self-doubt is natural, but we got it. Oh,

3957
03:08:19,120 --> 03:08:25,040
God, please just perish him before all these guys come out. Okay, thank you. Okay, no flame.

3958
03:08:26,880 --> 03:08:29,280
No, I'm keeping my money because we're going again.

3959
03:08:31,120 --> 03:08:34,240
If you guys have rule plays, let me make sure to send them in Marshmallow. Yeah, yeah,

3960
03:08:34,240 --> 03:08:36,960
don't... Yeah, you can do it for free. Stop giving me money. What the heck?

3961
03:08:38,720 --> 03:08:42,320
Do it for free in Marshmallow and you can rewrite what you've already submitted. Please don't

3962
03:08:42,880 --> 03:08:50,000
think you're ever bothering me by like... All right, reset. Ta-da! We're all the way back here.

3963
03:08:50,000 --> 03:08:53,760
Yeah, please don't think you're ever annoying me in Marshmallow or anything. Don't be silly, Billy.

3964
03:08:55,040 --> 03:08:59,760
I'm just glad that we can talk on Marshmallow again. Nun's Habit.

3965
03:09:04,560 --> 03:09:08,640
Behind the key is the key and a coin. Sure, I'll take it. All right, we're gonna...

3966
03:09:08,640 --> 03:09:16,160
Well, there's a meme audio idea test, a self-car. Oh, right, okay.

3967
03:09:19,120 --> 03:09:25,440
Right. Oh, we stalk up on Hells. I think that's... We'll stalk up on Hells.

3968
03:09:27,120 --> 03:09:31,680
And then we'll... Oh, wait, we'll take Nun's Habit in case of something good.

3969
03:09:32,240 --> 03:09:40,400
Fire rate, I'll take it. Shot speed, I'll take it. Range, I'll take it.

3970
03:09:41,920 --> 03:09:46,880
Tears and shot speed, I'll take it. Speed? I'm actually a bit of a speedy Gonzalez.

3971
03:09:47,760 --> 03:09:50,000
I'll take the Trinket because we actually don't have one.

3972
03:09:52,880 --> 03:09:54,080
You're done. Okay.

3973
03:09:56,880 --> 03:09:57,840
We'll reroll.

3974
03:10:01,920 --> 03:10:11,280
We have two, two diamonds.

3975
03:10:13,760 --> 03:10:20,480
Okay. Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay. I understand what needs to be done.

3976
03:10:21,120 --> 03:10:24,880
I understand what needs to be done. You need not give me... It's not that, but...

3977
03:10:25,840 --> 03:10:32,480
Okay, I'm pretty sure I heard him or I heard a bird on the roof. It's one of the others.

3978
03:10:33,680 --> 03:10:37,120
Okay, I understand what I need to do and I do have the strength to do it. Thank goodness.

3979
03:10:39,520 --> 03:10:46,960
Or just you spin me right round, baby, right round. When you go down, when you go down.

3980
03:10:46,960 --> 03:10:58,720
Where's the enemy? No idea. This floor, you cook. Yes.

3981
03:11:01,360 --> 03:11:06,560
So we can pop one of the cards and then take the one to the next floor and...

3982
03:11:06,560 --> 03:11:16,960
Okay, one more.

3983
03:11:18,800 --> 03:11:24,720
Now we're going to avoid the El Diablo. I'm no interested. You cannot tempt me this time around.

3984
03:11:24,720 --> 03:11:30,960
I was desperate because... Right, so we do have to pop one card on this floor because we don't have

3985
03:11:30,960 --> 03:11:36,000
room for a second card, which is understandable, haven't I say? We are going to... Oh, I should have

3986
03:11:36,000 --> 03:11:41,760
done it on the other side, but you know what? You live in your life. So we do have to pop one,

3987
03:11:41,760 --> 03:11:47,360
but we can pick up the other one and then use it on the next floor. No, please don't touch that.

3988
03:11:49,280 --> 03:11:54,560
Thank you. Okay, and just to make sure I wasn't going crazy, doubles Isaac's number of coins.

3989
03:11:54,560 --> 03:11:57,680
Right, once and then we pick this up, we take it to the next floor and then we'll

3990
03:11:57,680 --> 03:12:01,840
double what we have on the next floor. Okay, and then we jump down.

3991
03:12:05,520 --> 03:12:12,960
Karaoke stream when? After three weeks, if you want karaoke, I can do a karaoke.

3992
03:12:13,600 --> 03:12:24,240
Okay, five bombs, sure, and I don't actually want any red health. Goodbye. Oh wait, have immaculate

3993
03:12:24,240 --> 03:12:33,600
conception. Oh my god, these are good. Right, don't get distracted. Let's maximise our monies

3994
03:12:35,280 --> 03:12:41,120
by getting these guys, sorry, my stomach just made a noise. Karaoke club. I don't think my

3995
03:12:41,120 --> 03:12:53,520
ping is good enough for the, right, and then fire. Come on. Fire.

3996
03:12:57,760 --> 03:13:03,680
Come on. Karaoke would be fun. Yes, we can definitely do karaoke. I have no problems with that.

3997
03:13:04,400 --> 03:13:11,120
Oh, why bombs?

3998
03:13:16,800 --> 03:13:22,000
This game's so, oh, I lost my holy mantle. How? I haven't even saw the dying thing.

3999
03:13:23,120 --> 03:13:24,800
Right, we're going to back out and go in again.

4000
03:13:27,040 --> 03:13:32,080
Even though I should actually try and take damage because we have immaculate conception, but

4001
03:13:32,400 --> 03:13:37,680
at the end of the day, at the end of the day.

4002
03:13:41,920 --> 03:13:48,240
Okay, okay, sorry, I'm trying not to lose anything right now. Karaoke, you have to stream, my beloved.

4003
03:13:52,560 --> 03:14:00,160
Okay, sure. So if I bomb him, do I get anything? I don't think so.

4004
03:14:02,080 --> 03:14:12,160
Hold on, I'm so sorry. My dad's literally right outside the door. Even when it's like...

4005
03:14:32,160 --> 03:14:38,480
I had to tell myself, fuck off. He's on the phone with my mom and I'm like, stop saying names.

4006
03:14:39,200 --> 03:14:45,760
Stop saying names. Pleading with him. Right, okay, what was I doing?

4007
03:14:49,360 --> 03:14:52,000
Ah, okay. Sorry, I couldn't hear my ingame audio there.

4008
03:14:52,960 --> 03:15:02,400
What have I done? What? What did I do to the game?

4009
03:15:11,120 --> 03:15:12,480
Why aren't bombs popping?

4010
03:15:12,960 --> 03:15:24,720
Oh, I was like, did I break the game? Sorry about that. I was so confused.

4011
03:15:24,720 --> 03:15:28,000
Okay, yeah, so if I destroy an angel now, nothing happens.

4012
03:15:28,000 --> 03:15:32,800
I thought I broke the game. I was like, excuse me. Now, I know there is a heart in there, but I'm not

4013
03:15:32,800 --> 03:15:41,760
really... I was kind of hoping for a... Oh, I can take pills. I can see forever. I'm

4014
03:15:41,760 --> 03:15:45,440
drowning. Is it in here? No, it's not. It's actually down below.

4015
03:15:50,480 --> 03:15:56,320
A womb room. If I had a donation machine, a blood donation, that probably...

4016
03:15:56,560 --> 03:16:04,160
Oh, I'm just going to pop it now. All right, two diamonds pop.

4017
03:16:07,760 --> 03:16:10,480
Yeah, something tells me we're not going to struggle in the...

4018
03:16:10,480 --> 03:16:14,800
Sorry, I keep forgetting. That's a delay. I'll just take it.

4019
03:16:15,840 --> 03:16:24,240
Right, fully recharges activated. Give me. Give me. Give me. Give me.

4020
03:16:25,200 --> 03:16:28,320
Give me. What's my birth rate? Familiar is that normally,

4021
03:16:28,320 --> 03:16:33,920
fallotain to the lilas, follow her jello instead. The melee attack gains three damage.

4022
03:16:33,920 --> 03:16:37,120
I'll take it. I'll take it. Don't mind if I do.

4023
03:16:40,640 --> 03:16:45,360
Okay, we can always see the secret room. Sure. Mother transformation.

4024
03:16:48,480 --> 03:16:52,000
It's not really going to do much for me, but it's only seven. BFF!

4025
03:16:52,480 --> 03:16:57,680
BFF! My beloved. Okay, I'm going to restock like this.

4026
03:16:58,240 --> 03:17:02,720
Oh wait, let's see what trinket we get. 100% wider tears and restock back. Why not?

4027
03:17:04,800 --> 03:17:13,520
Right, trap door can give us a new item potentially. Whipping me. Range, heart, no.

4028
03:17:14,080 --> 03:17:24,560
I'm going to take this. Oh, there's chaos. Do we rip on chaos? Take the range.

4029
03:17:26,880 --> 03:17:32,080
Wow. Do we rip on chaos? Well, we can't grab that almond milk.

4030
03:17:35,120 --> 03:17:38,720
It's damage with C-section, is it? Oh, because of the whipping.

4031
03:17:39,680 --> 03:17:44,560
Oh, we got a paternal heart for it. I'll stop at you.

4032
03:17:49,200 --> 03:17:51,600
I'm starting to think you guys are in a fendom at this rate.

4033
03:17:53,360 --> 03:18:01,760
Thank you. I can't believe I have to say this. Thank you. Viewbot number 5109172 for the donation.

4034
03:18:01,760 --> 03:18:11,440
You're ridiculous. Thank you. Okay, wow. Jello's so big. Oh my god, look how wide they look like.

4035
03:18:12,720 --> 03:18:20,800
Right, well, we do chaos. As if yes or she wasn't any indication. Right, we've done chaos.

4036
03:18:22,320 --> 03:18:23,360
Number of bombs, sure.

4037
03:18:23,680 --> 03:18:30,960
Two of clubs. The two of clubs. Shot speed, no. Let's refresh.

4038
03:18:33,840 --> 03:18:39,280
Bouncy tears, absolutely. Where are you? Cage leaps on an enemy that deals the first

4039
03:18:39,280 --> 03:18:45,440
damage to Isaac, deals 90 damage and releases four rock, chases enemies for 13 contact damage, sure.

4040
03:18:46,400 --> 03:18:50,720
Spider baby, sure. I'll take it.

4041
03:18:51,760 --> 03:18:58,240
Flight, sure. I'll take it. I'm spending all that money. Petrifying tears, sure. I'll take it.

4042
03:18:58,240 --> 03:18:59,520
You don't have to tell me twice.

4043
03:19:01,760 --> 03:19:05,040
Angry fly for Beelzebub, sure. I'll take it.

4044
03:19:06,000 --> 03:19:08,400
A shield, sure. I'll take it.

4045
03:19:09,440 --> 03:19:11,920
Bloody guts, sure. I'll take it.

4046
03:19:12,720 --> 03:19:17,360
Gumpers, my beloved. I know I don't need it, but I'll take it.

4047
03:19:23,040 --> 03:19:27,200
Okay, sure. We'll take it. Oh no, we can't afford jiddy. My shadow, not jiddy.

4048
03:19:36,000 --> 03:19:39,360
Wait a minute, Jello can move this out the way. Come on, Jello.

4049
03:19:40,480 --> 03:19:44,480
Move out of the way for me. Yeah, I'm so smart. Oh my gosh.

4050
03:19:45,920 --> 03:19:53,200
I'm so smart. Why am I so smart? Oh my, whoa. Oh, I thought that was an enemy coming at me.

4051
03:19:53,200 --> 03:19:56,720
It's my own thing. Okay, let's do this.

4052
03:19:57,440 --> 03:20:06,240
Take almond milk. Can I reach it? I don't think I can take the thing.

4053
03:20:09,600 --> 03:20:17,120
Yeah, you need that thing, that puppet thing to get access to this one. It's a troll. We are being

4054
03:20:17,120 --> 03:20:21,920
filled. We are being made of full of ourselves. You need the jump book. You're flying. Wait,

4055
03:20:21,920 --> 03:20:27,040
what do you mean I'm flying? Yeah, I can't get in.

4056
03:20:30,000 --> 03:20:36,480
That's what Reefling said, I can't get in. Just use the back door. Right, if we do this,

4057
03:20:36,480 --> 03:20:43,840
it turns everything in here into a bomb. Something exploded over there.

4058
03:20:43,840 --> 03:20:51,200
Uh, don't need that. Don't need the bomb. So we'll just nuke this.

4059
03:20:52,640 --> 03:21:00,080
Get some pennies back, and then dead eye. Why not? Why not? I will take dead eye.

4060
03:21:01,040 --> 03:21:05,120
Okay, let's go. I'll just make sure I picked up everything.

4061
03:21:06,960 --> 03:21:11,440
Well, Maze will take that now. It doesn't really make much of a difference. Let's go.

4062
03:21:14,720 --> 03:21:17,520
No, you can only get it with the jump book pretty funny.

4063
03:21:18,560 --> 03:21:21,760
No, you can get it with that Muppet thingy, you know. I'm going crazy. Can't get in,

4064
03:21:21,760 --> 03:21:25,680
because I'm too big. Real entrance.

4065
03:21:32,560 --> 03:21:40,960
Hello? Are we about to go crazy? Right, I'm going to purposely get

4066
03:21:41,680 --> 03:21:49,120
energy on my dick, so I can dig your hole. All right, money for money. Oh wait, I have flight,

4067
03:21:49,120 --> 03:21:54,560
idiot. I'm going to pick up that box, because that's like the most OP thing I could possibly do at

4068
03:21:54,560 --> 03:22:04,720
this. Look at all the babies. I can't see anything. Uh, right, we're going to purposefully get...

4069
03:22:05,680 --> 03:22:12,480
Ah, sure, I'll take that. You're already crazy. This is overkill. I'm going to imagine if my game

4070
03:22:12,480 --> 03:22:19,920
got corrupted, because, uh, not corrupted. Bruh! Bruh, it's so bright in here. Hold on,

4071
03:22:19,920 --> 03:22:26,640
let me put reactive mode on, just so you know how is it going to go on. Is that reactive mode?

4072
03:22:27,040 --> 03:22:31,040
Yeah, that's how red is.

4073
03:22:38,400 --> 03:22:46,480
I have no idea what that did. Well, I'm going to do my wee staircase, and then I'm going to go down here.

4074
03:22:46,480 --> 03:22:50,560
Did I really help them with the visuals? Pretty, like, oh, we've got black mark!

4075
03:22:51,680 --> 03:22:55,040
Oh, I don't know if it's the one that doesn't let you progress. Like, some of them don't let

4076
03:22:55,040 --> 03:23:01,360
you go backwards, so hold on. Hold on, I am going to take this. I don't want to miss it.

4077
03:23:02,240 --> 03:23:10,000
Wouldn't miss it for the world, wefin. And then, we're just doing this. Oh, we've got perfection

4078
03:23:10,000 --> 03:23:15,040
unlocked! Oh, we can pick it up, actually, because we've got, um, I can't see shit.

4079
03:23:16,960 --> 03:23:21,840
Stop giving me devil deals, or you will pay for your crimes.

4080
03:23:25,200 --> 03:23:31,200
Roon shard! Oh, I've opened up a wimmy. Okay, we can't do anything, but we are going to go down

4081
03:23:31,200 --> 03:23:40,320
to the secret lair. Hopefully, we do get a Yara. No, not, oh wait, no, there is something here.

4082
03:23:43,040 --> 03:23:50,080
I hate the game going up where OP is. Um, it's going real good.

4083
03:23:50,880 --> 03:23:53,760
We're actually going to take this to add to our damage.

4084
03:23:54,720 --> 03:24:01,600
The black rune will consume it, so boom. And we got nothing we wanted. That's okay!

4085
03:24:02,640 --> 03:24:11,120
Right, I'm not health, fiery, range. There's no downside to you, I will take you.

4086
03:24:12,000 --> 03:24:19,360
Okay, let's go. What runes do you have unlocked? Not many. Yara was actually, oh, it's an error

4087
03:24:19,360 --> 03:24:28,400
room. Well, thank goodness I didn't go ahead. It's in here. Oh, there's a chest on him. Okay,

4088
03:24:28,400 --> 03:24:38,000
I'll blow him up. Picking up a coin has 21st chance to spawn a red heart. Well, I don't need

4089
03:24:38,000 --> 03:24:41,680
it, sweetie. And here you thought you weren't going to finish the run. Literally, I thought I

4090
03:24:41,680 --> 03:24:51,600
wasn't going to win, but we winning. We win, aim. Is she becoming on in 30 minutes? Or did I make?

4091
03:24:59,920 --> 03:25:11,120
Are you serious? I love chaos. I love chaos. I love chaos. 40 minutes until the collab. Okay,

4092
03:25:11,120 --> 03:25:14,880
I will redirect into sheepsters because I always seem to miss her, so I

4093
03:25:18,080 --> 03:25:26,000
I literally chaos deniers and shambles. And I get the Seraphim unlock. I know I already have

4094
03:25:26,000 --> 03:25:35,280
flight at the moment, but you know, Seraphim is nice. 23 damage. Oh, and a boss room little

4095
03:25:35,280 --> 03:25:43,360
cheeky man. Oh, look how big the babies are. They're humongous. They're a baby. Oh, wait,

4096
03:25:43,360 --> 03:25:54,000
I'm dumb dumb. Here. No, no, no, no. I don't want to skip. Okay, let's go. Whoa. What are you?

4097
03:25:54,560 --> 03:26:05,440
No, not Levitical. Levitical sucks. Okay, I see sack. Guppy's head. Wait,

4098
03:26:05,440 --> 03:26:11,920
I already have guppy? Oh yeah, I do because look how much buzzing around. Right, spawns a sack.

4099
03:26:11,920 --> 03:26:17,840
Every six rooms. That sounds good to me. Beelzebub transformation.

4100
03:26:17,920 --> 03:26:27,840
Not bad. Okay, let's blame him. I missed those things. Okay, hold on to her money.

4101
03:26:27,840 --> 03:26:34,480
We might get Yiera, which is in the room. Wait, if I pop my ult, I've popped it twice.

4102
03:26:35,120 --> 03:26:37,600
Oh my god, this is insane.

4103
03:26:38,560 --> 03:26:42,720
Bro, they can't even spawn in.

4104
03:26:45,360 --> 03:26:51,760
I can't even see. I don't. I don't want to pick up the coins in case I've got a Yiera.

4105
03:26:52,480 --> 03:26:55,760
I don't seem to have a Yiera. I don't seem to have half rooms at the moment.

4106
03:26:59,600 --> 03:27:06,400
Bro, I love this game. See, this is when the game's satisfying and you don't want to like

4107
03:27:06,400 --> 03:27:10,080
nuke it into the stratosphere is when you're like winning really easily. I said what I said.

4108
03:27:12,720 --> 03:27:17,920
Empty vessel. When Isaac has no red hearts, you get flight and you actually get a proc.

4109
03:27:17,920 --> 03:27:24,480
Aw, that's a shame that I've got so much. So, does you drop a pedestal item now because I have

4110
03:27:24,480 --> 03:27:27,520
chaos? No, you don't. Curious.

4111
03:27:30,720 --> 03:27:32,720
How did that black room get taken out of my hand?

4112
03:27:33,680 --> 03:27:37,440
Look how fast I have to charge it again. Barely took two seconds, honestly.

4113
03:27:37,440 --> 03:27:41,120
Right. No, I didn't drop a Yiera, but I'll do this one off.

4114
03:27:43,760 --> 03:27:48,000
I don't know what it does. Sometimes it doesn't even say out loud what it's doing and I'm like,

4115
03:27:48,000 --> 03:27:53,600
um, okay, that didn't help me at all. I am so small I can hardly pick up the coins properly.

4116
03:27:54,560 --> 03:28:00,640
Right. Uh, because nothing in here. Was there anything worth?

4117
03:28:05,920 --> 03:28:10,880
Every time we purchase something, we might get 0.5 damage.

4118
03:28:12,720 --> 03:28:18,400
Chaos deniers in shambles. Shambles.

4119
03:28:19,360 --> 03:28:23,600
Oh, and we've got money back, bro. Money back guarantee.

4120
03:28:25,360 --> 03:28:30,720
Oh, we can actually get rid of Levitical. We've got range for that, I'll take it.

4121
03:28:31,600 --> 03:28:36,560
Cause it's a chance to shoot. Yeah, we're gonna grab it and we're gonna be even more OP.

4122
03:28:37,120 --> 03:28:43,760
This is getting, this is getting a bit silly in that. Oh my god, hungry soul. I'll take Bob. No.

4123
03:28:44,400 --> 03:28:46,880
Well, we can actually get Bob Transformation if we want to.

4124
03:28:47,360 --> 03:28:53,680
Blood Poppy chases enemies. No, he's cute, but he's dangerous. He'll attack you if you're not careful.

4125
03:28:54,560 --> 03:29:00,800
It doesn't mean it. He just gets a little excited. Taking damage shoots, uh, sure.

4126
03:29:02,080 --> 03:29:06,480
So if we do end up taking damage, they're getting annihilated on site. They don't even have a choice

4127
03:29:06,480 --> 03:29:11,520
in the matter. Uh, Papa Fly. Chance Lock, yeah.

4128
03:29:13,040 --> 03:29:19,600
For, for $7 we can get 25 coins, sorry, 7 cent we can get. What's this?

4129
03:29:20,160 --> 03:29:24,000
I agreed. Every 20 seconds, Isaac shoots a coin tier that deals...

4130
03:29:25,280 --> 03:29:27,920
Oh no, I cost a coin to shoot. No, thank you.

4131
03:29:30,160 --> 03:29:34,720
What a deal. Literally, what a nice shop. I like the economy in Isaac's world.

4132
03:29:35,600 --> 03:29:41,920
You can break it so easily. A Rift? I actually think Rifts will be more dangerous because of our C-section.

4133
03:29:43,600 --> 03:29:52,000
Uh, we've got Book of Sin. Spawn's Barriers, no. We might try and go for Bookworm just because we can.

4134
03:29:53,520 --> 03:29:59,920
We don't need bombs. We don't need lunch. We can do it again. Maybe we'll bomb it just to re-roll it for free.

4135
03:29:59,920 --> 03:30:10,560
Polyphemus? Oh, I'm gonna cream. Oh, and we've got that as well. I'm creaming.

4136
03:30:10,560 --> 03:30:18,720
That's a shame we couldn't get that, but I'd rather take the thingy. Polyphemus. You just need Keeper's

4137
03:30:18,720 --> 03:30:28,960
head. 76 damage. Look at them all coming out. Brav. This is getting outrageous. This run. This is

4138
03:30:28,960 --> 03:30:38,080
outrageous. Oh no, the cloud. It said AFU to us. What, stinky cloud? 76 damage. Feels good, man.

4139
03:30:38,160 --> 03:30:50,160
That's a wee rune. I need to find out. Okay, I didn't do anything. Sure, let's bomb this.

4140
03:30:52,480 --> 03:30:59,440
What did you drop? More bombs. Okay. Sorry for the brightness. I'm trying to burn the Keeper's over

4141
03:30:59,440 --> 03:31:05,840
here. Man, I can't see. I need to leave. Sorry. I literally cannot see. What's going on? Right.

4142
03:31:05,840 --> 03:31:14,560
You. I've been needing you because... Oh no, I need... Oh, well, sure.

4143
03:31:19,600 --> 03:31:27,440
It's fine. You're allowed to do that. I can't see a thing, honestly. The flashbang in.

4144
03:31:27,440 --> 03:31:31,520
It's pretty severe after I've met, even by my standards. I'm like, sirion.

4145
03:31:32,320 --> 03:31:40,640
We got baby spin for all our familiars. They're actually gonna have accuracy, you know?

4146
03:31:42,960 --> 03:31:44,400
Oh, what are you giving us? Pills?

4147
03:31:47,200 --> 03:31:50,560
Wheel of Fortune? Yeah.

4148
03:31:50,720 --> 03:31:56,640
Is that what I just did? Is that a passive?

4149
03:31:57,920 --> 03:32:02,000
Luck up, sure. Hyrofan, sure.

4150
03:32:03,920 --> 03:32:14,000
Pretty fly. High Priestess. Okay, that was a lot. We're not doing that one. That one's rubbish.

4151
03:32:14,720 --> 03:32:22,960
Hopefully we'll get a Yara. What now, though? Bingeater. Oh, I like poison tears. I think poison

4152
03:32:22,960 --> 03:32:34,560
tears is the way to do it. Oh my god. I know I'm full, but... No, we don't actually need that.

4153
03:32:35,520 --> 03:32:40,000
I don't even know why I'm, like, trying to stretch your size with game. I mean, look,

4154
03:32:40,000 --> 03:32:42,800
we're not even a cheat. Like, this game's gonna break.

4155
03:32:47,120 --> 03:32:52,960
I can't even see. Oh, there's a Yara. I repeat, there is a Yara.

4156
03:32:54,480 --> 03:32:59,200
Is there another Yara? Imagine if we drop two Yaras. No, no, no, no, no. I don't want the coins

4157
03:32:59,280 --> 03:33:10,960
coming over to me. Nope, nope, nope, nope, nope. Nope. Okay, we've got Yara. Let's pop it.

4158
03:33:14,960 --> 03:33:23,040
Was there a second Yara? Nah. Draft. Okay, but we got the coins. That's the main thing.

4159
03:33:23,920 --> 03:33:25,200
We got our second Yara.

4160
03:33:29,840 --> 03:33:33,200
Okay, you know what? We'll just go for the devil. There's so much health in this.

4161
03:33:33,200 --> 03:33:35,840
Oh, I forgot we were not doing...

4162
03:33:38,160 --> 03:33:41,520
I'll take it for the bookworm transformation, but I'm not gonna leave with it.

4163
03:33:42,960 --> 03:33:46,960
What does it do? It gives a soul heart. Not sure. Give me up then. Pop it.

4164
03:33:47,360 --> 03:33:50,160
Oh, thank you.

4165
03:33:52,480 --> 03:33:54,240
I could have saved it for the next floor.

4166
03:33:57,120 --> 03:33:58,160
What'd you mean, the night?

4167
03:34:00,400 --> 03:34:01,520
Saved what, Monkos?

4168
03:34:03,200 --> 03:34:07,520
What did I misunderstand? I misunderstood. It does not compute. I suck.

4169
03:34:08,400 --> 03:34:10,960
Right, we'll do poison tier. I'm actually not that fussed for...

4170
03:34:11,920 --> 03:34:16,320
What's it called?

4171
03:34:17,520 --> 03:34:20,960
Benjyter, just because it cycles through everything and I'm really dumb.

4172
03:34:22,480 --> 03:34:28,320
Using a rune has a tip to spawn a copy. Oh, that's worth it. That's so worth it.

4173
03:34:29,760 --> 03:34:36,480
Okay, the 50% wider is worth it as well. I know I'm down to three luck, but we're doing so much

4174
03:34:36,480 --> 03:34:42,000
damage. I'm not fussed for Benjyter. I know it's good, but...

4175
03:34:44,960 --> 03:34:47,440
Do you need to save at this point? Probably not.

4176
03:34:47,440 --> 03:34:49,760
Tears up. Oh no, tears are capped, aren't they?

4177
03:34:50,960 --> 03:34:59,040
Thothic! Thothic. I got Thothic about damage and health. Conjoined, why not?

4178
03:34:59,600 --> 03:35:04,400
Enemies explode into tears. Isaac's tears are connected with a beam of electricity.

4179
03:35:07,600 --> 03:35:12,400
It's a good day to be an Isaac player. It's a fantastic day to be an Isaac player.

4180
03:35:12,400 --> 03:35:14,480
Damage, just whole straight up damage.

4181
03:35:16,720 --> 03:35:19,520
Oh, it's a good day. Right, we're gonna bomb you too.

4182
03:35:22,400 --> 03:35:26,240
Thank you. What does the cookie do again?

4183
03:35:26,240 --> 03:35:28,480
Each of Isaac's tears have a different stars effect.

4184
03:35:30,160 --> 03:35:33,440
We're gonna get the Christmas box in here. Oh, wait.

4185
03:35:36,160 --> 03:35:38,960
I've got lump of coal, I'm guessing. It doesn't work.

4186
03:35:39,840 --> 03:35:43,600
We'll grab it, honestly. We'll just spend everything. Spend them all.

4187
03:35:45,200 --> 03:35:49,840
We're melting the PC today. If us, where if this game breaks right at the end?

4188
03:35:49,840 --> 03:35:53,520
I'll be region. We're literally one away from the boss fight.

4189
03:35:54,080 --> 03:35:59,680
Play the cookie, it's fun. Yes. One here.

4190
03:36:02,480 --> 03:36:07,520
Sure, give me an internal heart. Okay, bomb, so it's fine.

4191
03:36:09,680 --> 03:36:13,760
What are we looking at? Oh, well, we can actually get a devil horseman.

4192
03:36:14,720 --> 03:36:17,440
Oh, no, the fire thing isn't broken. Hold on.

4193
03:36:19,360 --> 03:36:23,120
Okay, I think it's propped. Is there one over here? I have no idea. Hold on.

4194
03:36:24,000 --> 03:36:27,840
Oh, that's a... We'll grab the seven seals, why not?

4195
03:36:29,120 --> 03:36:32,640
I don't think we actually have to play anymore, if I'm being honest.

4196
03:36:33,200 --> 03:36:35,680
I think we got Yara instantly.

4197
03:36:41,840 --> 03:36:42,880
I got a green shark.

4198
03:36:46,480 --> 03:36:50,800
I can't see. There is a Yara. I'm gonna pick it up.

4199
03:36:51,760 --> 03:36:53,440
So it's already in my persons.

4200
03:36:59,680 --> 03:37:02,320
Okay, okay. One more time.

4201
03:37:04,720 --> 03:37:07,840
I didn't even... I didn't even need to do a new shoot.

4202
03:37:07,840 --> 03:37:11,280
Yeah, I'm gonna pop the Yara, so it'll be a surprise if there's a Yara up there or not.

4203
03:37:12,400 --> 03:37:15,360
Well, that's so good. Thank you for that. Please don't waste my time ever again.

4204
03:37:17,520 --> 03:37:19,520
What enemies literally cannot see them?

4205
03:37:21,680 --> 03:37:22,480
Okay, we got him.

4206
03:37:23,920 --> 03:37:25,680
Good thing. Maybe.

4207
03:37:27,520 --> 03:37:28,400
What did that do?

4208
03:37:30,400 --> 03:37:33,280
Yeah, it does not do anything. Rune shard.

4209
03:37:33,280 --> 03:37:37,600
Okay, let's just grab all this money, spend it, and you.

4210
03:37:37,600 --> 03:37:42,000
Because this was like the best run I could have ever asked for.

4211
03:37:42,000 --> 03:37:46,800
Literally a reset key. Special shout out to reset key. You did it.

4212
03:37:47,520 --> 03:37:52,240
I'm gonna try and... actually, you know what? I have 30 bombs. I think I'll be okay.

4213
03:37:53,360 --> 03:37:56,880
I'll just spawn them. Spawns a random coin.

4214
03:37:56,880 --> 03:38:01,680
Imagine if we got Lilith giving birth to babies, literally.

4215
03:38:02,400 --> 03:38:04,640
She's raising the population by herself.

4216
03:38:10,160 --> 03:38:13,200
A whip. No, I want this one.

4217
03:38:14,160 --> 03:38:17,040
Could you imagine if that Yara duplicated though?

4218
03:38:18,080 --> 03:38:19,920
Could you imagine if it did though?

4219
03:38:22,240 --> 03:38:26,560
The high priestess. I got a drowsy repeatedly. Oh, thanks, I guess. Drowsy.

4220
03:38:28,160 --> 03:38:32,640
Okay, let's see what we can buy. Oh, no point in the coin thing.

4221
03:38:32,880 --> 03:38:42,080
We've got a quick worm. Not bad.

4222
03:38:43,440 --> 03:38:47,280
Could just go with familiars, to be honest, because we're about to double the familiars.

4223
03:38:48,240 --> 03:38:53,360
Levity in front of Isaac deals... what, ill damage?

4224
03:38:53,360 --> 03:38:56,240
Jeez, sure. Give me that. I don't recognize it.

4225
03:38:56,880 --> 03:38:59,760
Spectral tears. I think my tears already capped long ago.

4226
03:38:59,840 --> 03:39:02,880
Picking up 15 hearts, yeah. Go for it.

4227
03:39:04,960 --> 03:39:07,760
We'll reroll a little cheeky reroll. Actually, we're just gonna bomb for it,

4228
03:39:07,760 --> 03:39:10,800
because we've not got that much money. Three hell.

4229
03:39:11,760 --> 03:39:15,920
Sure, why not? Just give us everything, okay?

4230
03:39:15,920 --> 03:39:18,400
Whoa, what do you get? A chest gives you one coin.

4231
03:39:19,120 --> 03:39:22,880
It's a bit late for that, I think. We could maybe bomb these.

4232
03:39:23,040 --> 03:39:28,000
Okay, uh, I'm gonna bomb too.

4233
03:39:29,600 --> 03:39:34,320
Okay. Well, something tells me we're ready for this greed fight.

4234
03:39:34,320 --> 03:39:38,720
You know, I'm not too sure we've got it in the bag, but why not? Let's see, one coin.

4235
03:39:43,280 --> 03:39:43,600
Okay.

4236
03:39:46,480 --> 03:39:50,800
Oh, that was a tough one. That was scary. Not gonna lie, I was on the edge of my seat.

4237
03:39:52,960 --> 03:39:58,560
Okay, let's at least get some money to donate to them. Okay, here it goes.

4238
03:40:02,160 --> 03:40:03,680
Oh, for goodness sake.

4239
03:40:05,920 --> 03:40:08,080
Could you imagine this is greedier of always?

4240
03:40:10,720 --> 03:40:13,200
Sure, I will put money in the greed mission.

4241
03:40:14,160 --> 03:40:24,160
I'm ridiculous. Let's pop these. Maybe we can get a few coins to put in the machine.

4242
03:40:26,080 --> 03:40:27,440
That was crazy.

4243
03:40:30,560 --> 03:40:32,720
Oh, we got a few more coins to put in. That wasn't bad.

4244
03:40:37,120 --> 03:40:40,800
That was so close. I know we almost didn't make it.

4245
03:40:41,760 --> 03:40:47,920
But yeah, that's Lilith on greed mode. As you can see, she's OPE, the Binding of Bosses easy game.

4246
03:40:48,560 --> 03:40:52,640
It just depends. Sometimes you can get the best run and it makes you addicted to the game,

4247
03:40:52,640 --> 03:40:56,400
and sometimes you can get work, but like terrible run after terrible run,

4248
03:40:56,400 --> 03:41:00,480
and it makes you so upset you literally are like, had enough.

4249
03:41:03,200 --> 03:41:07,600
So if I minutes until the collab. Okay, I will do marshmallows,

4250
03:41:08,560 --> 03:41:12,720
and I will make sure I'm redirecting into Sheepster's. She is broken in general.

4251
03:41:12,720 --> 03:41:18,000
Try her if you want an easy run. Does donate and even do anything after the first time?

4252
03:41:18,000 --> 03:41:21,440
No, it doesn't, but I just do it because, because why not?

4253
03:41:21,440 --> 03:41:26,480
But yeah, that's my save file on Isaac. So this game becomes multiplayer in November,

4254
03:41:26,480 --> 03:41:34,000
which is when you guys are going to come in, because yeah, I haven't gotten all the unlocks.

4255
03:41:34,960 --> 03:41:41,360
Um, I still don't even comprehend how some of the characters work, like, um.

4256
03:41:44,880 --> 03:41:49,280
Who's that? Bethany? I always struggle to understand what she's doing.

4257
03:41:49,280 --> 03:41:54,080
Shawnee's going to carry us in this game. I know for once I get to carry you, maybe, I'm not sure.

4258
03:41:55,200 --> 03:41:59,200
I'm not, I guess I could start playing. No, it's very, if it's not the game for you,

4259
03:41:59,200 --> 03:42:04,640
do not force it. I am so serious when I say that. Bethany is really strong in the city.

4260
03:42:04,640 --> 03:42:09,360
I just want the game to play with you. Oh no! You need to make sure you actually like the game.

4261
03:42:09,360 --> 03:42:16,480
It's not an easy game. So that, those symbols on the left side are like the unlocks of certain bosses

4262
03:42:16,480 --> 03:42:22,880
that have killed, and like, I'm missing a lot. Like, the tattered page means I've done delirium

4263
03:42:22,880 --> 03:42:27,600
and all of that, and most of these are like super lucky runs. I don't really get good.

4264
03:42:28,560 --> 03:42:32,800
There needs to be a mod where the familiars are replaced by rooflings. I would be so down.

4265
03:42:32,800 --> 03:42:38,880
I finished Tainted Lost, then we've go, brev, brev. I've not even started on Tainted Lost.

4266
03:42:39,440 --> 03:42:45,520
I'm too, like, this is how the average Tainted Lost run goes. Are you ready?

4267
03:42:46,960 --> 03:42:51,120
So we, we have a holy card. We can pop it, so we're now one shot death.

4268
03:42:52,080 --> 03:42:59,840
Like, this is, we're not going to make it. Yeah, we've got a sacrifice room that we can't

4269
03:42:59,840 --> 03:43:05,600
do anything, and before it finishes the run, no chance. I have attempted so many times and I just get,

4270
03:43:07,440 --> 03:43:10,480
like, literally we're down, we don't have another holy mantle.

4271
03:43:12,480 --> 03:43:20,080
Or, I've already messed up. Okay, we're not fighting those spiders. Like, this is how bad it is.

4272
03:43:21,920 --> 03:43:26,160
Tainted, Tainted is just, like, such a un,

4273
03:43:28,080 --> 03:43:32,720
unfun experience. Now, I'm sure it's fun when you actually, oh,

4274
03:43:35,600 --> 03:43:41,680
okay, well, right, let's try again. Let me just try and explain again how bad this is.

4275
03:43:41,680 --> 03:43:46,080
Okay, we're going to pop the holy card, and then we're going to, you know, just flutter about,

4276
03:43:46,080 --> 03:43:52,320
get a few things going on. And we're just going to check out the shop, okay. Mm-hmm, close enough.

4277
03:43:54,640 --> 03:44:00,880
Yeah, like, eternal hearts mean nothing, so, yeah. Strony is locking it. No, it's not happening.

4278
03:44:00,880 --> 03:44:05,600
I basically, in order to even get anywhere, I would need to roll,

4279
03:44:09,040 --> 03:44:12,800
maybe a spoon bender. I'd need to roll that first.

4280
03:44:13,200 --> 03:44:19,680
Now, the only thing is, we do have spectral tears, which means we can shoot through rocks,

4281
03:44:19,680 --> 03:44:23,200
like that, which is obviously a bit much, much, mutual helpful.

4282
03:44:25,360 --> 03:44:32,560
But no, I have never successfully done this. I remember when we both came out and people had

4283
03:44:32,560 --> 03:44:39,840
to date, I mean, how to get the lost, honestly. Some of the requirements in this game are like,

4284
03:44:39,840 --> 03:44:49,120
right there. But yeah, I basically would need, like, the most OP items ever. Now,

4285
03:44:49,120 --> 03:44:55,760
the tainted lost apparently comes with better items. Do we believe that? Let's find out what this

4286
03:44:55,760 --> 03:45:10,480
better item is, hmm? Oh, what? Hold on. Hold on. The one item I need. The one item I need. Hold

4287
03:45:10,480 --> 03:45:18,240
on. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. The one item I need in order to do this

4288
03:45:18,240 --> 03:45:28,960
game mode. The one item I need in order to do this game mode is the sign. It's the sign. It's

4289
03:45:28,960 --> 03:45:32,960
the sign. It's the sign. It's the sign. Right, don't mess up. Don't mess up. Don't mess up. Don't mess

4290
03:45:32,960 --> 03:45:42,800
up. I don't want to mess up, but those strays from the flies are very dangerous, as well as his

4291
03:45:42,800 --> 03:45:51,040
triple shot. Hmm, not a fan. Oh my god, we have an orbital. We're so safe. Let's go.

4292
03:45:53,760 --> 03:45:59,520
Focus. This run is real. Better items means you can't find useless items and gives health and

4293
03:45:59,520 --> 03:46:08,480
weight. Okay, now I can take a devil deal. That's not a problem. So I actually misplayed there. I

4294
03:46:08,480 --> 03:46:14,240
could have killed all these guys without them getting close to me like this. But we can hover on

4295
03:46:14,240 --> 03:46:19,920
the rocks safely and I'm taking it. I don't care. You should boost the fight, strongy. No, I don't

4296
03:46:19,920 --> 03:46:25,680
care. I'm literally tainted gloss. Leave me alone. I'm just going to blow it up because it's a health

4297
03:46:25,680 --> 03:46:30,080
hazard, okay? Okay, this room's a bit of a hazard. I'm pretty sure they have spectral shots. Do they

4298
03:46:30,080 --> 03:46:38,560
not? Well, they can come on the rocks. So, not the best room, but we're alive. Oh, we need a key.

4299
03:46:43,120 --> 03:46:51,120
Okay, a key. Our coins. Coins are a key. No one destroyed, strongy. I also can't find defense,

4300
03:46:51,120 --> 03:46:57,520
like most orbitals, cuba, meat, bandage, or exception. Yeah, nod leaf is taken out of the item

4301
03:46:57,520 --> 03:47:04,320
pool. If I had nod leaf, the only reason I've done stuff on the other tainted, the lost in general,

4302
03:47:05,200 --> 03:47:09,600
but nod leaf is taken out of the item pool for tainted. And I'm like, ah, great. The only thing

4303
03:47:09,600 --> 03:47:17,120
that is keeping me alive during all my runs. Nod leaf is the MVP for me personally. Okay, I have a

4304
03:47:17,120 --> 03:47:28,960
key. I'm actually going to regret this if it's not got a key and it doesn't have a key. Key!

4305
03:47:32,720 --> 03:47:33,840
That might have been wiser.

4306
03:47:37,120 --> 03:47:44,000
We're going to have to sadly skip our item room, it appears, but we got a second

4307
03:47:44,000 --> 03:47:51,920
lifeline with holy mantle. That is an unfortunate pill to swallow. Maybe I can get a key out of

4308
03:47:51,920 --> 03:48:03,040
any, a key, a coin out, oh, there we go. We are going to pick up phd, so it means we can swallow pills.

4309
03:48:04,800 --> 03:48:13,440
Something's wrong. Okay, now you have to play it. I'm not, I don't know. Okay, okay, okay.

4310
03:48:13,520 --> 03:48:27,600
Hopefully this is, this. Okay, it looked like a secret. Oh, what? What? Right.

4311
03:48:31,200 --> 03:48:35,440
That's why I didn't want to happen. And there's a secret room!

4312
03:48:35,840 --> 03:48:48,320
Oh, I'm so scared. Oh my god. Oh my god, is this the run?

4313
03:48:52,160 --> 03:48:53,200
Is this the run?

4314
03:48:53,920 --> 03:49:08,000
Is this the run? We got blank card on tainted lost with holy card in our freaking holster.

4315
03:49:10,160 --> 03:49:14,560
Oh, please don't fuck it up. I'm going to be so sad. I'm going to be so sad if I fuck this up.

4316
03:49:14,560 --> 03:49:26,560
I'm going to camp on the rock. I know. Okay, we can, we can take a devil deal. It's fine.

4317
03:49:29,600 --> 03:49:37,440
Curious. Oh no, it's goat head. My apologies, it's goat head. Absolutely, absolutely on goat

4318
03:49:37,840 --> 03:49:39,600
head. Okay, so we can choose now.

4319
03:49:45,680 --> 03:49:52,960
Okay, I am so scared. The code, papa, vector, hotel, foxtrot,

4320
03:49:53,520 --> 03:50:05,760
New Guinea. What's it? November, echo, wanker, November. I hardly even know.

4321
03:50:07,680 --> 03:50:13,920
I am so scared to progress. I don't not want to lose this run. I feel like I'm going to be dumb

4322
03:50:13,920 --> 03:50:21,360
and use the card or something. Can, holy mantles can't stack, can they? I can't stack this holy

4323
03:50:21,360 --> 03:50:30,400
mantle card. I've never had the combo before. Okay, sorry. They can't stack. Okay.

4324
03:50:32,800 --> 03:50:37,360
Sorry, I just got a little nervous. Sorry. I lost my cool a little bit.

4325
03:50:41,520 --> 03:50:48,720
Okay. Okay, now I just need some good combos to put my damage up so I can one shot stuff as soon

4326
03:50:48,720 --> 03:50:53,680
as I enter the room. Is that too much to ask for? To one shot stuff, huh?

4327
03:50:55,280 --> 03:51:02,000
Not this room, not this room. It's so small. Okay. Okay, hold it. Cards can't stack, but

4328
03:51:03,520 --> 03:51:16,320
consider this. I am MLG pro. Shot speed up. Okay. Okay. I'm analising the contents, not really

4329
03:51:16,320 --> 03:51:24,320
speaking to me. I don't know where to go. I feel it. Yeah, I was going to say, I feel like this is

4330
03:51:24,320 --> 03:51:34,400
the way to the boss. Okay, easy, easy. Take out any. It's not small. It's just cool. You lost your

4331
03:51:34,400 --> 03:51:42,960
cool. I lost my cool. Oh, wait, shit. Oh, my soundboard isn't up. Right. Sorry. I need to try

4332
03:51:42,960 --> 03:51:51,280
hard. Forget the soundboard. This might actually be the run. This might actually be the run. I'm just

4333
03:51:51,280 --> 03:51:56,960
from afar, nice and safe. If I could get contact to protect me.

4334
03:51:56,960 --> 03:52:07,440
Ah, right, okay. Okay, okay. What's in here?

4335
03:52:09,280 --> 03:52:17,280
Moves along. Enemies are attracted to the fly. Okay, this is good. Oh, that's why it's called

4336
03:52:17,280 --> 03:52:21,520
lost fly because it takes away the attention from lost. I know there's a tinted rock here,

4337
03:52:22,240 --> 03:52:29,040
but we don't take any so hard. I don't think we're going to raid Toshiba on time. Oh, no.

4338
03:52:30,480 --> 03:52:36,400
Don't the whole point. Oh, don't thank you. Right, okay. Let me get up, let me get up.

4339
03:52:36,400 --> 03:52:39,440
Nice and steady. Use her.

4340
03:52:39,440 --> 03:52:51,120
Well, we just turned back into the boss. I don't know. These spectral tears are so good early on.

4341
03:52:58,000 --> 03:53:04,240
Okay, he's attacking him, so I'll do that. No, no.

4342
03:53:05,200 --> 03:53:10,160
We're not. Key. I was too late for that on the other side of the map now.

4343
03:53:11,920 --> 03:53:16,960
Right, holy car, do not dare use right bumper or I will eat your face.

4344
03:53:18,800 --> 03:53:23,280
Okay, well, I was a waste. Don't do that again. I believe Mercy is going to be the one responsible

4345
03:53:23,280 --> 03:53:27,360
for the POV. Okay, okay, okay. Okay, okay, okay.

4346
03:53:27,360 --> 03:53:36,240
Okay, I can do this. Well, the odds of the secret room being right here are pretty high.

4347
03:53:37,760 --> 03:53:41,680
Yeah, what we got? Rubbage, right.

4348
03:53:45,600 --> 03:53:47,920
Oh, no, I'm not getting an item.

4349
03:53:50,560 --> 03:53:54,960
Unless it, well, if it's another, oh, he's attacking the fly. Thank goodness.

4350
03:53:55,360 --> 03:54:01,440
Okay, 50%. He might, yeah, I was going to say he might swap the flies out of range now.

4351
03:54:04,960 --> 03:54:08,720
Yep, that's okay. Perfect will.

4352
03:54:10,800 --> 03:54:18,480
Cube and meat. Lamal. Cube and meat. We take perfection. I mean, we can fly over to items.

4353
03:54:25,600 --> 03:54:32,720
Well, sure. And pop it. Well, there's no point in popping it, but we could maybe get

4354
03:54:32,720 --> 03:54:40,400
bookworm or whatever it's called. Oh, stress, stress, stress, stress.

4355
03:54:42,560 --> 03:54:48,880
They are making Shrek 5. Better not. Thank you, but meat. Well, if it turned into meat boy,

4356
03:54:48,880 --> 03:54:53,840
meat boy goes away and attacks, which wouldn't go amiss.

4357
03:54:58,640 --> 03:54:59,440
Why are you a patch?

4358
03:55:05,760 --> 03:55:09,360
Okay, these are the diagonal guys, so we're just going to stay nice and steady.

4359
03:55:09,360 --> 03:55:19,920
Breathe and hydrate, bro, honestly. I'm so stressed right now. My blood pressures through

4360
03:55:19,920 --> 03:55:25,760
the roof. My ears must be red from how stressed I am right now. Okay, we've got lucky penny,

4361
03:55:25,760 --> 03:55:31,040
so if we pick up any kind of staticy effect, as long as we don't get walloped,

4362
03:55:32,640 --> 03:55:34,880
I couldn't have made that closer if I desired.

4363
03:55:35,840 --> 03:55:42,240
I couldn't have made that any closer if I had the desire to. I would like to find the shop, please.

4364
03:55:42,800 --> 03:55:48,240
No. Let's go to this one for that. He can't come over yet.

4365
03:55:52,160 --> 03:55:53,120
Oh, I do have a key.

4366
03:55:56,160 --> 03:56:02,240
Yeah, 11% luck. I'm going to need you to start dropping pickups because I'm starting to not

4367
03:56:02,240 --> 03:56:12,400
think it's 11% luck. I need range as well. I need to be able to safely attack from like halfway

4368
03:56:12,400 --> 03:56:23,520
across the room. A bomb? A bomb's not key though. Can you say key? Right, I'm going to push them

4369
03:56:23,520 --> 03:56:28,000
into the fly on purpose. I could have easily gotten hit by that. I'm not going to lie.

4370
03:56:28,240 --> 03:56:38,320
Okay, he's rejecting key. Right, I'm not laughing anymore video game. I'm getting stressed.

4371
03:56:40,000 --> 03:56:45,200
I'm getting stressed. Okay, we have a key. It's a golden one, so we don't have to sacrifice any key we obtain.

4372
03:56:49,760 --> 03:56:56,960
Why is this map so long? I almost just backed into that. I almost just backed into that. I'm

4373
03:56:56,960 --> 03:57:07,040
not even kidding. Oh, I saw it. The pointy rock in the corner. I am playing so safe. You have no idea.

4374
03:57:09,200 --> 03:57:12,880
I'm trying to range up the exact thing I needed. Hallelujah.

4375
03:57:14,800 --> 03:57:16,800
The game may sometimes deliver.

4376
03:57:18,560 --> 03:57:25,200
Automatically charges and fully charges the active item. Okay, I'll just pick it up now.

4377
03:57:26,960 --> 03:57:34,960
So we can get it even more common. Yeah, this is definitely a bomb run and not any other kind of run.

4378
03:57:38,080 --> 03:57:42,480
I'm stressed. The blood, if I had a heart rate monitor on right now, it is not going to blow

4379
03:57:42,480 --> 03:57:47,840
on 120. Right, we're going to turn back and we're going to go to the item room.

4380
03:57:48,240 --> 03:57:52,880
I love how you can actually do it in pencil. It's so much

4381
03:57:53,920 --> 03:58:02,880
big. Just ask Johnny. It seems like, how about work? Fly is putting in work. The fly is taking

4382
03:58:02,880 --> 03:58:10,000
all of the aggro when we enter a room, which is really, you know, that's such a shame. Yeah,

4383
03:58:10,000 --> 03:58:16,560
the game is like, oh yeah, you get good items. The items in the game. Butt bombs, top blasts.

4384
03:58:16,560 --> 03:58:23,600
Okay, thanks, I guess. That's just an average day for me, if I'm being honest. Butt bombs.

4385
03:58:26,800 --> 03:58:32,320
I love how this began as a demonstration of why lost runs are so hard and then you get a god run.

4386
03:58:33,600 --> 03:58:37,280
The pressure is getting worse, so I feel like I'm going to mess it up really badly,

4387
03:58:37,280 --> 03:58:43,280
which is a shame, but it's kind of on par for me. So I wouldn't be too surprised.

4388
03:58:46,800 --> 03:58:52,640
Wouldn't be surprised at all. Oh, I don't like that. I don't like that. Thank goodness that

4389
03:58:52,640 --> 03:59:07,280
fly took the aggro for those spaky guys. Wow. Breathe. I'm so scared.

4390
03:59:07,440 --> 03:59:16,880
I'm going to be sick. I'm actually going to be sick in this run.

4391
03:59:20,080 --> 03:59:23,600
A quarter or a backstab. I'm going to go with a backstab.

4392
03:59:27,600 --> 03:59:33,840
Oh, I'm so stressed. What other items do you need? Everything. Just everything.

4393
03:59:34,480 --> 03:59:37,200
We're on floor five. One more and then we do mam.

4394
03:59:40,160 --> 03:59:44,320
Curse of the blinds. So we don't know what item we're going to pick up, but thankfully

4395
03:59:46,320 --> 03:59:52,560
I made it home. You're alive. You didn't die. Thank you for the tip, Rolly legends.

4396
03:59:55,200 --> 04:00:02,640
Oh, not good, not good, not good, not good. I am so lucky I held back those bullets there.

4397
04:00:04,400 --> 04:00:10,000
Come on. Come on, just die. You're not even a champion.

4398
04:00:14,320 --> 04:00:17,200
I feel sick to my stomach from worry.

4399
04:00:20,880 --> 04:00:26,160
Everyone wants a gamer girlfriend until she throws up on Isaac because she's got a really good last run.

4400
04:00:27,520 --> 04:00:31,120
Okay, we're going to get money from this fight. We know that there's not a greed's fight in the

4401
04:00:31,120 --> 04:00:38,720
shop, so it is worth her here. Oh, my stomach is actually twisting and nervousness. Bro, calm down,

4402
04:00:38,720 --> 04:00:43,520
relax. It's just a video game. If it's just a video game, then why does it make me so happy? Win, win.

4403
04:00:46,160 --> 04:00:49,360
Her palms are swayed. They are freaking, oh, we got another range.

4404
04:00:51,280 --> 04:00:59,040
Oh, this cannot be true. And yet it is my eye. Oh, it's the jumpy ones. It's the ones I don't like.

4405
04:00:59,600 --> 04:01:02,400
They've got blood on their front. That means they're a jumpy one.

4406
04:01:04,720 --> 04:01:07,920
Okay, okay, that's fine.

4407
04:01:10,480 --> 04:01:13,440
Oh, my, I'm not kidding. My guts are genuinely twisting, bro.

4408
04:01:16,880 --> 04:01:21,840
Okay, take your time. Take your, use your, you can

4409
04:01:22,400 --> 04:01:31,840
know again, Hunter. I kind of still want perfection. Whoa, we got planetarium. No way.

4410
04:01:39,360 --> 04:01:45,360
If I lose, you have to comfort me unironically, Ruth, and that's so mean. Putting that pressure

4411
04:01:45,360 --> 04:01:50,880
on me. We got planetarium. Please be political or like something or Venus or take Venus.

4412
04:01:52,160 --> 04:02:02,400
Oh, God. Mars. What does Mars do? I don't know what Mars does. I've never had it before. What does

4413
04:02:02,400 --> 04:02:11,760
Mars do? GG run. Wait, why? What does it do? Double tap the move button.

4414
04:02:12,160 --> 04:02:24,480
This is getting wet. What? Double tap the move button.

4415
04:02:26,800 --> 04:02:33,120
Nothing's happening. Mars is bad. Of course, I get the only one thing that's bad.

4416
04:02:35,520 --> 04:02:37,680
Double tap, move in the same direction.

4417
04:02:37,680 --> 04:02:46,640
What? I have a ram. I have a ram. What's wrong with ram? Am I going crazy?

4418
04:02:48,320 --> 04:02:51,920
Okay, we're better chests. I'll take it. Wait, what's the

4419
04:02:53,440 --> 04:02:56,720
one point? It lets you dash, but it works weird.

4420
04:03:00,480 --> 04:03:02,720
Oh, that's so lucky to fly, honestly.

4421
04:03:03,600 --> 04:03:10,640
Short speed. Flight for the room. No, we need holy mantle. Don't tempt me.

4422
04:03:11,360 --> 04:03:13,600
We already have flight. We're the loss.

4423
04:03:18,880 --> 04:03:22,800
And before I die via mimic chest, I wouldn't put that past me.

4424
04:03:25,280 --> 04:03:26,240
Okay, that's fine.

4425
04:03:26,720 --> 04:03:34,240
Well, we have mum's keys. We actually don't need that.

4426
04:03:36,080 --> 04:03:41,040
Oh, no. These guys will charge across the map. I am letting distance do the rest.

4427
04:03:42,720 --> 04:03:47,600
You can use it to go in the curse room. I am not risking like that. I am not good enough for that.

4428
04:03:47,600 --> 04:03:52,880
Right, we've got the planetarium. We've got everything along the way. Okay.

4429
04:03:53,600 --> 04:03:56,080
Monster 2.0.

4430
04:04:01,840 --> 04:04:07,920
I don't like it. Okay, he's focusing on the fly, though. I'll take it. If you want to charge the

4431
04:04:07,920 --> 04:04:13,920
fly, I was going to keep up with the fly. Oh, this is fantastic for aggro.

4432
04:04:14,000 --> 04:04:20,160
Oh, this is fantastic. Oh, farted, sorry. Excuse me.

4433
04:04:23,200 --> 04:04:26,640
We need to get poisoned. They got poisoned by Mayukas. Mayukas.

4434
04:04:28,320 --> 04:04:30,960
Buy a bow here, ladies and gentlemen. Buy a bow here.

4435
04:04:31,840 --> 04:04:33,680
Oh, right, aggro. He's got aggro.

4436
04:04:34,720 --> 04:04:38,080
Well, okay, I understand the problem now with Mars.

4437
04:04:38,480 --> 04:04:42,400
I did not do that. I understand the problem with Mars.

4438
04:04:43,920 --> 04:04:48,080
I understand the problem with Mars. I don't know what it is, but I'm taking it. It's free.

4439
04:04:48,080 --> 04:04:54,160
Okay, we've got a guppy's hairball, sure. Mars is very bad. I agree. I agree, I agree, I agree.

4440
04:04:57,040 --> 04:05:00,560
Lost fly is good. Right, we're doing the first mum fight.

4441
04:05:01,520 --> 04:05:03,760
It's like we have hardly any damage.

4442
04:05:11,920 --> 04:05:12,560
Someone.

4443
04:05:17,200 --> 04:05:23,760
All right, no mimic chest. What was that? Short speed? That looks like it.

4444
04:05:27,920 --> 04:05:28,880
Take your time.

4445
04:05:31,440 --> 04:05:34,480
Oh, that's in here.

4446
04:05:37,840 --> 04:05:40,720
Oh, that's kind of worth it if I don't fuck up.

4447
04:05:44,000 --> 04:05:46,880
Kind of worth it if I don't mess it up.

4448
04:05:49,360 --> 04:05:52,960
I think I'm going to have to do it. I do. Okay, okay, okay.

4449
04:05:52,960 --> 04:06:01,840
What? You moved me. Please focus on that fly above you.

4450
04:06:03,840 --> 04:06:07,360
Please. The fly. Oh, okay.

4451
04:06:09,680 --> 04:06:13,440
Okay, the poison damage is, I don't know. Did we do it?

4452
04:06:15,120 --> 04:06:21,920
Okay. No, no, no, no, no, no. The fly. The fly. Look at the fly. No, Mars, please.

4453
04:06:21,920 --> 04:06:24,000
How did you even do that? I was looking above.

4454
04:06:26,880 --> 04:06:31,840
Oh my gosh. Oh, all right, we've got damage. That's all. Okay, I'm luck. Okay, I'll take it.

4455
04:06:33,520 --> 04:06:38,160
I'm going to be sick. Anonymous. Thank you. You didn't say anything in your message. Thank you,

4456
04:06:38,160 --> 04:06:45,120
though. I will take that as your silent support of this run. This most stressful encounter. I'm

4457
04:06:45,120 --> 04:06:49,360
going to have to tell my dad to stop doing whatever he's doing. I'm actually about to talk.

4458
04:06:50,880 --> 04:06:58,480
It's fine. We're okay. We're okay. Relax, relax, relax, relax, relax. Okay,

4459
04:06:59,840 --> 04:07:09,680
marked. I don't like marked. That's shit. Okay. That's right. Just look at the fly.

4460
04:07:10,240 --> 04:07:17,680
Mimic chest. The fly is so delicious, isn't it? My heart just jumped. It's fine. We have a holy card

4461
04:07:17,680 --> 04:07:24,480
and we have the card repeater. Curse of the maze strikes again. Curse of the maze wasn't supposed

4462
04:07:24,480 --> 04:07:31,200
to put us in here, but okay. We already have it back. Thankfully, we also have voltage or

4463
04:07:31,200 --> 04:07:38,240
whatever it's called. I'll just forget the name between them both. Relax, relax, relax. Safety,

4464
04:07:38,240 --> 04:07:44,000
safety, safety, safety, safety, safety, safety, safety. I'm not sure what we would benefit in an

4465
04:07:44,000 --> 04:07:54,000
arcade. Hell, maybe. Give us our item room. I am, yeah, I was purposely-

4466
04:07:54,000 --> 04:08:13,040
Oh, my heart is jumping. Speed. I'll take speed. That can get us away from the enemy.

4467
04:08:13,680 --> 04:08:24,800
Okay. I can pick all these up. That's fine. Check it was in the shop. A greed bait. That's fine.

4468
04:08:26,800 --> 04:08:32,320
Okay. Okay, absolutely wait for me. That damage upgrade? Fantastic. I'll take 12 more of them,

4469
04:08:32,320 --> 04:08:39,600
please. I'll have 14 more. Right. Okay. So greed can no longer appear in shops because we dealt with

4470
04:08:39,600 --> 04:08:46,320
greed and super greed. So now for the boss. Right, we're going to check out the arcade. I have plenty

4471
04:08:46,320 --> 04:08:57,120
of money to go around. No. But thank you though. But no thanks. Okay, we're just going to gently

4472
04:08:57,120 --> 04:09:06,880
make our way, Mosey, our way back to the boss fight. Now, this is ma'am. Oh, it's the end, isn't it?

4473
04:09:06,880 --> 04:09:11,360
It's the last shop. Oh, you're right. I don't realize how fast we're going through it. Not me going

4474
04:09:11,360 --> 04:09:24,720
faster in this mode than like actually playing a regular cane run. Okay. Okay, okay. That's fine.

4475
04:09:26,560 --> 04:09:33,520
Wow, we are so interested in that one fly, aren't we? Oh, we love that one fly. Thank God I have

4476
04:09:33,520 --> 04:09:37,600
the mod that lets me actually see when she's stomping down. Mars, not now.

4477
04:09:50,240 --> 04:09:51,120
Not now, Mars.

4478
04:09:55,680 --> 04:10:00,480
I was really hoping for a Pluto because we could get such a small hitbox with Pluto.

4479
04:10:01,040 --> 04:10:08,720
We did it. What are we taking though? What's the question? Enjoying, sure.

4480
04:10:10,720 --> 04:10:12,240
What are we taking? Damage?

4481
04:10:17,040 --> 04:10:25,360
Invincibility. That was cat. Damage. Taking damage at half a red heart and none. Damage. Okay, the

4482
04:10:25,360 --> 04:10:36,720
negative. 7.61, that was good. That was good, right. Hold it together,

4483
04:10:36,720 --> 04:10:46,800
refling. Hold it together. I'm very nervous. Yeah, I don't even have one unlock on him.

4484
04:10:47,520 --> 04:10:54,560
Just, I'm going to use a lot of rocks for cover and stuff like that.

4485
04:11:01,680 --> 04:11:07,200
Or moam down like that, that's also an option. I'm going to pick up all I can. If we get like

4486
04:11:07,200 --> 04:11:10,320
beggars, I'm just going to give it to them. They might be able to this.

4487
04:11:10,320 --> 04:11:13,440
Assist us.

4488
04:11:18,000 --> 04:11:21,680
I am so sorry if I seem like such a tryhard. It's because I am tryharding.

4489
04:11:22,720 --> 04:11:25,440
Please follow the fly, not me, the fly.

4490
04:11:28,080 --> 04:11:37,440
Okay, take your time. That was naughty. That was very naughty.

4491
04:11:41,280 --> 04:11:49,440
Oh my god, my dad's gone for a piss.

4492
04:11:50,400 --> 04:12:02,560
The toilet's right outside my door.

4493
04:12:08,240 --> 04:12:13,360
All right, let's try that again, shall we? There's a shame we didn't get more pills. You

4494
04:12:13,360 --> 04:12:16,560
know that should have bought the pills in the shop. I just think I was paying enough attention.

4495
04:12:16,640 --> 04:12:20,240
That's on me. Oh, that's on me. That was my mistake.

4496
04:12:24,480 --> 04:12:31,360
You first. You next. Just take your time. We've got, time is on our side, okay?

4497
04:12:32,320 --> 04:12:36,800
Where there's no timer, there's no rush. We just need to find the boss room.

4498
04:12:39,360 --> 04:12:44,320
I'm fine. I'm not just randomly singing out terrifying fear. Okay, that's fantastic.

4499
04:12:45,040 --> 04:12:48,320
We're going to see if there's a, oh, there you go.

4500
04:12:50,880 --> 04:12:53,120
I just realized that thing splattered and could have got us.

4501
04:12:55,040 --> 04:12:58,080
What the hell, Shrek 5 is real. Are you guys trolling me right now in the middle of this

4502
04:12:58,640 --> 04:13:07,520
very intense game? Please look at the fly. The fly, yes, the fly. The fly. Oh my gosh.

4503
04:13:08,080 --> 04:13:15,520
Oh my gosh, are we going to do it? Size down, hit box smaller. I repeat, hit box smaller.

4504
04:13:17,520 --> 04:13:22,240
Hit box, stop, Marshmars. I was going to say Marshmallow. No.

4505
04:13:27,200 --> 04:13:35,920
Wow, wow, wow, wow. Okay, that's fine. Okay, holy cards. We'll have everything. Okay.

4506
04:13:37,520 --> 04:13:40,960
All out for head. Yeah, Shrek 5 is in production. It's almost enough, so.

4507
04:13:41,680 --> 04:13:46,240
You really deserve a cola. I will, I am going to lie down after this one. I can tell you that much.

4508
04:13:50,960 --> 04:13:57,840
Gamer instinct. Where is the boss? Top left. Okay, gamer instinct. Don't let us down.

4509
04:13:58,880 --> 04:14:02,880
Now again, we have spectral tears. We will use rocks to our full advantage.

4510
04:14:03,840 --> 04:14:11,840
Okay.

4511
04:14:13,360 --> 04:14:16,960
Oh, that's okay, Marsh. You were allowed to do that when I'm not in a fate,

4512
04:14:16,960 --> 04:14:23,600
but when I'm in a fate, Marsh, no, Marsh, that's naughty. You're a naughty boy, Marsh. You know,

4513
04:14:23,600 --> 04:14:30,320
I didn't want you. You know, I wanted you to be Pluto. Shit. Please do not fuck up in this room.

4514
04:14:31,280 --> 04:14:34,880
Okay, yeah, let's go for the day. Yes, yeah, let's go for the...

4515
04:14:35,680 --> 04:14:40,240
See how there was a flat wall and all the enemies spawned right side? Do not tear or touch that.

4516
04:14:43,360 --> 04:14:51,040
Okay. Okay, okay. Sorry, I am tryharding out the Wazoo. I'm not even pretending.

4517
04:14:51,040 --> 04:14:54,480
We could do Gambo, but we don't have a beggar, so there's no point. I'm telling you,

4518
04:14:54,560 --> 04:14:56,880
do it on purpose. I will fly it in your boot, too.

4519
04:14:59,840 --> 04:15:04,960
I don't want to break these rocks. These rocks can break into splatters. I might actually hurt

4520
04:15:04,960 --> 04:15:16,640
myself. I know. Go away. Oh, gamer instinct. Oh, my gosh, gamer instinct. They can fly,

4521
04:15:16,640 --> 04:15:21,760
they can fly. They fly now. They fly now. They fly now. Okay, okay, to get it.

4522
04:15:22,720 --> 04:15:26,560
Yeah, he could fly a couple of episodes back, but it's fine. He'll let us sleep.

4523
04:15:29,120 --> 04:15:32,240
No, I could only be, like, if it wasn't here, I could only be there.

4524
04:15:39,760 --> 04:15:43,200
Oh, no, I messed up. I messed up. I messed up.

4525
04:15:43,840 --> 04:15:48,880
Oh, go for the fly. Go for the fly. We love the fly. We love casting spells. Shadow Wizard,

4526
04:15:49,440 --> 04:15:55,840
yeah. Mars saved me. Mars, I judged you too quickly. Forgive my ignorance,

4527
04:15:55,840 --> 04:16:01,840
for I did not know what I was judging. I love you, Mars. We love the planet. We love the red

4528
04:16:01,840 --> 04:16:09,520
planet. We love the iron-ice planet. Oh, that's fine. It's fine.

4529
04:16:12,560 --> 04:16:18,480
Wait, on half a heart or less, I assume that counts right now. Surely that counts right now.

4530
04:16:19,200 --> 04:16:27,040
Oh, okay, okay, we're in the money. Not as being able to do hush, absolutely not, right?

4531
04:16:27,040 --> 04:16:33,360
We took the negative, we must go down. We must stay focused. Yay, now you're all...

4532
04:16:35,600 --> 04:16:42,640
Babylon works. Okay, gamer instincts. Bottom right, gamer instincts, bottom right.

4533
04:16:42,880 --> 04:16:49,840
Shh, you know what? I've had a lot of gamer instincts today. Let's try that again. I meant

4534
04:16:49,840 --> 04:16:57,920
to say right, right, it's for gamer... Okay, hold on. We can take these. Yes, please. Range,

4535
04:16:59,040 --> 04:17:06,000
speed, sure. Something's wrong. Short speed, absolutely. Power pill, no.

4536
04:17:06,800 --> 04:17:11,920
Okay, please do not whip me through the rock. I would appreciate that.

4537
04:17:13,680 --> 04:17:17,920
Do we want to be max speed? I don't know if we actually want to be max speed,

4538
04:17:17,920 --> 04:17:24,640
because it gets very slippery. No, no, no, no, no, no, focus on the fly, the fly, the fly.

4539
04:17:29,200 --> 04:17:33,920
Oh, are you ranged? Yep, I want to shoot from halfway across the room.

4540
04:17:33,920 --> 04:17:36,320
If I'm correct, about right side gamer instinct.

4541
04:17:42,160 --> 04:17:49,360
I am wrong. Okay, go for the thing, go for the thing, not me, go for the fly. Go for the fly!

4542
04:17:50,880 --> 04:17:58,160
The fly! Go for the fly! Oh, what was the secret room, though? Because why would it be,

4543
04:17:58,640 --> 04:18:06,880
no. Okay, it's top right. I was close. Okay, do not roll over any rocks that have spikes in them.

4544
04:18:07,920 --> 04:18:09,520
What are you and why are you that colour?

4545
04:18:14,480 --> 04:18:19,600
No secret room, secret room above? Okay, these rooms are getting odd, though.

4546
04:18:20,400 --> 04:18:28,560
Stay in the rocks, shiver me timbers. My timbers have been shivered.

4547
04:18:30,560 --> 04:18:36,720
Oh, in the rock. Oh, laser beam! I did not even see that laser beam, that was so lucky.

4548
04:18:37,600 --> 04:18:45,040
I did not even see that beam. I'm happy with my trinket, I will not be tempted.

4549
04:18:49,840 --> 04:18:53,360
He doesn't go away. Okay, that's fine. He doesn't have to go away, okay.

4550
04:18:55,760 --> 04:19:03,760
Gamer, oh no, it's the Satan fight, okay. Gamer instinct, go for the fly. No Mars, not now.

4551
04:19:06,560 --> 04:19:11,520
Okay, they're going for the fly, I'm happy. Okay, Satan, go for the fly, go for the fly,

4552
04:19:11,520 --> 04:19:15,840
go for the fly, Satan, go for the fly, Satan, go for the fly, go for the fly. We love,

4553
04:19:15,840 --> 04:19:25,760
we love going for flies. Yes, good, Satan. Now, the last fight, go for the fly,

4554
04:19:27,440 --> 04:19:37,920
go for the fly, the fly. We love the fly, we love the fly, we, we lost fly.

4555
04:19:38,080 --> 04:19:47,280
Oh, God, are we doing it? Can we do it? Can we do lamb on tainted?

4556
04:19:49,680 --> 04:19:59,280
Oh, we can take nothing, can we take anything from here? I don't know how it works,

4557
04:19:59,280 --> 04:20:02,080
can we take anything? We have Athene, I've never had Athene.

4558
04:20:02,800 --> 04:20:11,200
Can I take one thing from here? Take one, I am, take brimstone, okay, I trust you.

4559
04:20:14,160 --> 04:20:21,120
Okay, shit. Oh, it's homing, I have homing, I forgot.

4560
04:20:24,000 --> 04:20:28,800
I forgot we had homing. Oh, what, there's three? I thought there was two.

4561
04:20:29,200 --> 04:20:32,000
Two. Mars, not now, buddy.

4562
04:20:39,440 --> 04:20:42,240
I have a sore stomach because I'm gaming so hard.

4563
04:20:44,080 --> 04:20:47,920
Stop, look at the fly, look at the fly, we love the fly.

4564
04:20:49,760 --> 04:20:56,400
How I did not lose anything there. Oh, the fly, please.

4565
04:20:59,440 --> 04:21:05,440
Okay, okay, the fly. No, do not give me bombs.

4566
04:21:09,200 --> 04:21:14,560
Oh, consecutive tier hits, yes sir. The fly.

4567
04:21:16,880 --> 04:21:22,720
You know you want to take that, Gro, I almost just walked into him and substituted my holy mantle.

4568
04:21:23,120 --> 04:21:24,640
Oh.

4569
04:21:27,840 --> 04:21:36,400
Tears can bounce, can brimstone bounce on these cheeks? I'm asking for a friend, can brimstone bounce?

4570
04:21:39,120 --> 04:21:43,840
Oh my gosh, where is it? Is it bottom left?

4571
04:21:47,120 --> 04:21:51,040
It's either left up or down left, so strong I can hear that.

4572
04:21:51,040 --> 04:21:54,800
So strongly I heard the stream is pre-recorded one or counter that.

4573
04:21:54,800 --> 04:21:58,560
I read it before your thing loaded, get right, that's how it's not pre-recorded.

4574
04:22:00,560 --> 04:22:04,000
It's not what we want, but it's okay, thank you for your submission.

4575
04:22:07,920 --> 04:22:14,400
Okay, that's right, like that, the fly is getting, oh, wow, wow.

4576
04:22:14,400 --> 04:22:16,640
Thank you Broly legend for the tip, I'm so sorry.

4577
04:22:17,600 --> 04:22:21,040
Nope, we're absolutely not, proof that this is pre-recorded confirmed.

4578
04:22:21,040 --> 04:22:25,680
That's not, how, oh no, okay, he's gonna be occupied with that fly.

4579
04:22:26,880 --> 04:22:32,800
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, okay, it has to be left side.

4580
04:22:35,680 --> 04:22:40,720
I don't, I don't think I want that, I don't know, you guys will tell me if I should take it or not.

4581
04:22:41,440 --> 04:22:47,120
Okay, will you guys tell me if I need that?

4582
04:22:47,680 --> 04:22:52,800
Inner eye, decreases my fire rate, Isaac shoots three tears at once though.

4583
04:22:54,800 --> 04:22:57,520
Triple shot is good, slower shot but three.

4584
04:22:58,320 --> 04:23:00,960
Doesn't give you triple brimstone, I have no idea.

4585
04:23:00,960 --> 04:23:02,480
I have wall bouncing as well.

4586
04:23:05,040 --> 04:23:09,040
Let's find out, is it wall bounce, oh okay, it like fully wall bounces.

4587
04:23:11,280 --> 04:23:16,080
Oh wow, okay, wow, wee wee wow.

4588
04:23:17,680 --> 04:23:19,680
Oh, I missed that shot, that's okay.

4589
04:23:21,840 --> 04:23:24,000
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay.

4590
04:23:24,640 --> 04:23:29,600
Oh, and we got a fricking unbelievably, we got that back, unbelievably, I can't believe that.

4591
04:23:29,600 --> 04:23:32,080
I do believe, but it happens so I believe it, I believe.

4592
04:23:34,880 --> 04:23:36,960
Spiders do not give contact damage.

4593
04:23:36,960 --> 04:23:44,000
Now, hear me out, we go back and try and pick up as much items as possible or do you think we can do it?

4594
04:23:46,240 --> 04:23:52,080
Did we just go for it or did I go back and pick up as, wait, you say pre, if I unlock delirium,

4595
04:23:52,080 --> 04:23:57,440
you're right, if I unlock delirium we have to send it for delirium, so I'm going to try and unlock everything.

4596
04:23:59,760 --> 04:24:02,960
Perfect, we're gonna, we might get delirium, okay,

4597
04:24:03,680 --> 04:24:06,960
and if we do, I want to be as ready as I can be.

4598
04:24:08,160 --> 04:24:10,240
Mars, you are so cheeky.

4599
04:24:11,680 --> 04:24:15,760
You're a cheeky boy Mars and you know exactly what you're doing, giving me a heart attack.

4600
04:24:18,000 --> 04:24:25,120
Okay, bombs, sure, poison immunity, a chance for a random direction, sure, I'll absolutely take that, are you joking?

4601
04:24:27,440 --> 04:24:28,400
What we got, what we got?

4602
04:24:29,840 --> 04:24:31,920
Invincibility, every six frames,

4603
04:24:33,840 --> 04:24:36,160
okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.

4604
04:24:38,400 --> 04:24:47,440
We pray for delirium, we pray for delirium, I can't believe I'm asking for delirium, but I am, no,

4605
04:24:49,360 --> 04:24:53,120
no, no, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, not a good pick up.

4606
04:24:57,440 --> 04:25:01,760
There might be a secret room here but I don't know, I don't know,

4607
04:25:02,320 --> 04:25:10,320
maybe here, there you go, no, room, room, delirium doesn't close when you exit the room,

4608
04:25:10,320 --> 04:25:12,160
I didn't know that, hello, okay,

4609
04:25:14,960 --> 04:25:22,160
come on, Mr. Fly, it's the lost fly versus lamb, it's nothing else, oh, he's like literally synced on

4610
04:25:22,160 --> 04:25:33,680
tom, oh, he's synced on tom, he can't get enough, oh my god, no delirium, no delirium,

4611
04:25:36,240 --> 04:25:45,120
drop, no delirium, okay, we did it though, that's my first fucking win, let's go, gee,

4612
04:25:45,120 --> 04:25:57,440
motherfucking gee, wait, oh, you liar, you liar video game,

4613
04:26:01,280 --> 04:26:03,520
am I getting the unlocks, I'm not getting achievements,

4614
04:26:05,040 --> 04:26:09,280
there they are, I know we're not playing hard mode, I don't care, I'm number one on this one,

4615
04:26:09,280 --> 04:26:18,560
okay, delirium, I'm coming for you buddy, I don't know where you are but let's go for it,

4616
04:26:19,840 --> 04:26:25,440
now you do get boss items by doing boss room so we could upgrade our current stash,

4617
04:26:26,880 --> 04:26:28,320
spiders don't hurt us, let's go,

4618
04:26:29,040 --> 04:26:37,760
oh, can we do delirium as a question, Mars, stop, you naughty boy,

4619
04:26:40,640 --> 04:26:50,000
sure, sure, how do it, oh, come on,

4620
04:26:50,640 --> 04:26:56,560
oh, come on, where's the first boss fight, right, we've got one here,

4621
04:26:59,760 --> 04:27:03,040
okay, school x, not to be confused,

4622
04:27:09,520 --> 04:27:13,600
I mean, at this point does keys make a difference, not really, might as well just take them,

4623
04:27:14,240 --> 04:27:18,560
he could maybe give us a guffy from a red chest if he were to drop one,

4624
04:27:22,480 --> 04:27:26,560
okay, so unfortunately our first item didn't give us anything good but that's okay,

4625
04:27:34,080 --> 04:27:39,200
we're just playing it nice and safe, take that key,

4626
04:27:44,080 --> 04:27:50,480
okay, okay, nice and safe,

4627
04:27:52,400 --> 04:27:56,160
is that a boogie, no I don't want some boogie, thank you though,

4628
04:27:57,520 --> 04:28:00,880
that's a lot of items, keys, oh I could have given it to him,

4629
04:28:02,080 --> 04:28:07,200
didn't take that far, hey did oh, surely I'm just blasting this to oblivion, stream,

4630
04:28:08,000 --> 04:28:15,920
oh, respawn though, what happens if you respawn, don't be shy, respawn some more,

4631
04:28:17,840 --> 04:28:19,920
drain's all short speed,

4632
04:28:24,240 --> 04:28:33,120
wait, keys, you want to take that key, oh no, it's one of these rooms, is it,

4633
04:28:33,120 --> 04:28:38,160
it's one of these rooms,

4634
04:28:44,400 --> 04:28:49,120
I can chase them around the room, oh thank you buddy, look there's more keys for you if you want

4635
04:28:49,120 --> 04:28:55,840
them, what are you thinking, you want this key too, no, you shy, okay, you don't have to,

4636
04:28:55,840 --> 04:29:00,160
you don't have to give me keys all the time, it's fine, oh no, okay, another new chest,

4637
04:29:00,160 --> 04:29:08,880
okay, okay more money, thanks mate, more key, oh, oh I do like bird food, but can I do it,

4638
04:29:09,680 --> 04:29:14,480
can I do it, I've no got two trinket slots, unless, do I, I don't know, I'll go back, oh sorry,

4639
04:29:15,200 --> 04:29:22,560
I was gonna hand it to him physically, after the holy chest it just stops items, I wish I had freaking

4640
04:29:23,520 --> 04:29:30,880
another slot for dead bird because that's like another player on the map really,

4641
04:29:30,880 --> 04:29:38,880
able to, anyways, I start to bless them, I am sweeping, that cannot be a secret room,

4642
04:29:38,880 --> 04:29:55,040
okay, no key, okay, oh, just mild stress with delirium,

4643
04:29:57,840 --> 04:30:05,920
shumer goes to hospital for a heart attack due to playing the lost on Isaac, that'd be quite the

4644
04:30:05,920 --> 04:30:12,480
headline, my stomach's sore, my heart isn't sore, but my stomach's sore, it's twisting,

4645
04:30:12,480 --> 04:30:21,120
out of nervousness, that could have gone terribly wrong, I'll remember there's a

4646
04:30:21,120 --> 04:30:33,280
arrow in here, but there's not too much I can do with it, come on, oh wow, I'd shot too late,

4647
04:30:34,000 --> 04:30:45,360
or early hover, don't do that to me, my heart can't take it, mimic chest, now's not the time to show up,

4648
04:30:45,920 --> 04:30:54,800
now is not the time for mimic chest to show up, do I make myself clear, arrange up,

4649
04:31:02,480 --> 04:31:10,240
full health, full mapping, okay, now we can use this to our advantage,

4650
04:31:11,200 --> 04:31:20,000
if we go down we can get to boss, we can get boss fights that aren't delirium confirmed,

4651
04:31:24,000 --> 04:31:32,160
did I almost just walk into a chest though, I almost did it wrong, okay, we can

4652
04:31:32,480 --> 04:31:35,600
take this, keep her sat,

4653
04:31:39,440 --> 04:31:43,280
I mean it's too late now, I'm sorry,

4654
04:31:45,760 --> 04:31:49,760
keep taking his weakies, I'm sorry, I don't mean it, I promise I'm doing it on purpose buddy,

4655
04:31:51,680 --> 04:31:56,000
which is very low IQ right now, okay there, take it,

4656
04:31:56,240 --> 04:32:00,400
right, this one can't be delirium,

4657
04:32:03,200 --> 04:32:09,120
I'll take that, are you joking, all stats up, I'll take that, right, what one can't be delirium,

4658
04:32:16,400 --> 04:32:19,920
I mean it's unlikely it's this one, it looks like the top left is delirium,

4659
04:32:20,880 --> 04:32:32,960
down is free, gentle, what do we get, a bane, I don't want a bane,

4660
04:32:36,400 --> 04:32:40,960
which one, it looks like that left one, like if you look where I'm literally

4661
04:32:40,960 --> 04:32:45,200
standing in the game on the map, I think that one's delirium, I mean this one

4662
04:32:45,440 --> 04:32:53,120
and the one over there, right, we'll go up for now because I don't think the one up is delirium,

4663
04:32:55,360 --> 04:33:00,160
sack and sausage, I don't even see that, I'll take that, are you joking,

4664
04:33:02,880 --> 04:33:06,160
okay, no keys for you this time buddy, sorry,

4665
04:33:07,040 --> 04:33:16,160
okay, a blast assist, okay, down left is free, okay and then delirium is where I think he is on

4666
04:33:16,160 --> 04:33:24,400
the map, sure bottoms why not, then yeah we've got one more boss to walk by and then it's delirium,

4667
04:33:24,400 --> 04:33:31,360
oh boy, I hope because we are smaller,

4668
04:33:33,360 --> 04:33:40,320
we are gonna be okay, yeah for a second, yeah, I hope because we are smaller, our hitbox does not

4669
04:33:40,320 --> 04:33:50,320
right just, okay,

4670
04:33:54,560 --> 04:34:03,280
okay, that was dangerous, oh there's pins, okay that was lucky,

4671
04:34:03,280 --> 04:34:07,040
okay, oh right,

4672
04:34:10,000 --> 04:34:15,200
how much more OP can I get, I've come on a smaller hitbox, let's go,

4673
04:34:18,160 --> 04:34:25,120
ooh, oh you're so funny like that delirium, you think I didn't see silly sausage, I don't

4674
04:34:25,120 --> 04:34:32,480
know exactly where you are, you think I don't have the skill, the intellect, the foresight

4675
04:34:32,480 --> 04:34:38,240
to know what's going on with you Mr. Delirium, do you think I do not know these things, your

4676
04:34:38,240 --> 04:34:47,520
crafty ways, your terrible reign against poor Isaac that you have, the grasp that the boy cannot seem

4677
04:34:47,520 --> 04:34:58,960
to undo, stop it delirium, you're upsetting me, I'm one shot, no well I have a Hail Mary,

4678
04:35:01,840 --> 04:35:10,560
you're upsetting me delirium, no more will you harm the child known as Isaac,

4679
04:35:10,880 --> 04:35:15,920
the boy will no peace, he will ascend without you,

4680
04:35:22,880 --> 04:35:23,760
did I do it,

4681
04:35:24,080 --> 04:35:32,400
did I do it, I did it, I unlocked ghost bombs,

4682
04:35:34,960 --> 04:35:37,920
I did it, oh my god,

4683
04:35:42,080 --> 04:35:50,480
oh I don't, that's not registered, I did that, I just did that, my first ever look like tainted lost,

4684
04:35:54,640 --> 04:35:58,320
oh my god, that's not registering,

4685
04:36:00,240 --> 04:36:05,600
what did I say about this stream being squitted being pre-recorded and that you would win your

4686
04:36:05,600 --> 04:36:11,200
first lost run on stream, I think maybe you need to comfort me instead of the other way around

4687
04:36:11,200 --> 04:36:19,280
for all the denial, now be a good girl and come cuddle me, oh my god, what just happened,

4688
04:36:20,240 --> 04:36:25,840
thank you so much, anonymous, you never even said anything, thank you tiny spiny for the tip,

4689
04:36:25,840 --> 04:36:32,880
anonymous, congratulations, take my super chat cherry, I think I took it twice,

4690
04:36:32,880 --> 04:36:40,160
did you mean to do that twice, thank you domino mickey, I'm thinking, congratulations,

4691
04:36:40,160 --> 04:36:48,720
take my super chat cherry, I can't believe I did that, our hands are sweating, I'm like ringing my

4692
04:36:48,720 --> 04:36:55,440
hands right now, I'm so nervous, money duplication glitch, thank you, yeah thank you for the money

4693
04:36:55,440 --> 04:37:10,080
duplication, oh my gosh, thank you anonymous, oh my god, we did that, we have ghost bombs,

4694
04:37:10,240 --> 04:37:17,440
oh, we unlocked ghost bombs,

4695
04:37:21,520 --> 04:37:24,720
well I don't know where they'd be but I assume somewhere near the end,

4696
04:37:27,360 --> 04:37:34,000
you're so good, no that was luck, literally we started with homing, the spin is the only reason

4697
04:37:34,000 --> 04:37:40,800
I could do that run, the spoon is the only reason, scrawny has humbling bundle in real life, okay

4698
04:37:40,800 --> 04:37:47,360
that's actually really good, ghost bomb for ghost bomb, you have to take them up to have them appear

4699
04:37:47,360 --> 04:37:52,720
twice, might have said in before at the start the run that died on the second room doesn't count,

4700
04:37:53,360 --> 04:37:59,760
thank you no alessandro, we did it, amazing performance, I don't know how I did that,

4701
04:38:00,160 --> 04:38:06,080
ghost bombs, I don't know where they're hiding but they're somewhere here,

4702
04:38:08,240 --> 04:38:15,360
I can't believe that, that's absolutely amazing, there, there you are Mars, I could have rolled

4703
04:38:15,360 --> 04:38:20,720
anything else, radiant victory, the moon's blessing, so secret rooms, mercury speed up,

4704
04:38:20,720 --> 04:38:27,120
you feel elusive so I'm super fast, venus, I have charm effect, born of rock destroy stuff,

4705
04:38:27,120 --> 04:38:34,240
one more run, this is a rare chance to get created by mercy, no I'm redirecting to mercy now,

4706
04:38:34,240 --> 04:38:43,120
thank you so much, don't sit down with it, I can't believe that, oh my goodness, thank you

4707
04:38:43,120 --> 04:38:50,080
juke lucifuge, that's not how you say it, how the fuck do you say that, juke lucifuge, is that how

4708
04:38:50,080 --> 04:38:58,000
you say it, fudge, thank you for the 50 gifted memberships, broly legend, because of Mars, Mars
