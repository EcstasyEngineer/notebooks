0	29720	Good morning I guess you couldn't faint in foil
29720	34720	I'll have PNG, the best I got is a JPEG.
37240	40840	I'm fucking typed in 10-4, I'll have PNG.
40840	44000	And again, none of them were PNGs.
45280	47480	So I'm fucking have this on my head.
47480	50080	Hold on, I need to re-calibrate.
52280	54200	Okay, there we go, I re-calibrated.
54200	56840	I'm freaking spinning off my head.
60520	63120	Shit, I did not filter through transparent images.
63120	64920	I absolutely did not.
64920	67200	I think I got to the eighth one and I was like,
67200	68640	you know what, I like this one
68640	73240	because the top part, the top part of the tin foil.
73240	74960	It looks so good.
74960	76280	And I was like, I want this.
76280	79640	So, I'll give myself the hiccups.
80640	83120	Right, no hiccups, because it's gonna hurt.
84360	88880	Okay, it's so funny considering the background, literally.
90320	91600	Right, I don't want the hiccups
91600	93120	because it's gonna really hurt.
94200	96920	This too was a high-table plot, literally me.
96920	101000	I don't know, I had a tin foil PNG like the other day.
101000	103800	Levy Exodus, thank you for becoming a member.
103800	105640	I appreciate it.
105640	107720	What kind of membership streams do I make?
107720	109760	In general, you're asking.
109760	113200	I usually stream three to four membership streams a week.
113200	114520	Are you squidding me right now?
114520	116120	But I have to...
116120	118000	Did some reeflings miss?
118000	119680	You got some white in your hair.
119680	121800	No, it's a PNG on purpose.
121800	123440	It's not a PNG by accident.
123440	124800	Are you squidding me right now?
124800	126120	A JPEG on purpose.
128240	129680	Mm!
129680	130920	I'm gonna go, Brian doesn't read out,
130920	131880	but I'll read out, don't worry.
131880	133320	Spidey, thank you for the tip.
133320	134160	I appreciate it.
134160	137160	Good morning, good evening, good afternoon, reeflings.
137160	138800	Akadea says,
139640	142080	love, love, please take care of yourself.
142080	143000	Greetings from Germany.
143000	145440	Hello, Leute, Dankeschön.
146400	148840	Bitte, for das,
148840	151080	a membership einen Month.
151080	153160	Dankeschön.
153160	154640	It's the best I've got, I'm sorry.
154640	156360	Any German people listening?
157720	159720	I feel like the crying women mean,
159720	162200	babe, just go to sleep, you don't need a streamer.
162200	163520	I'm okay.
163520	167200	So basically, I'm gonna do a little yapping,
167200	172000	but thank you so much to everyone who has reached out.
172120	175600	Management basically got like,
175600	179360	six more clippers on board, which is perfect.
180360	183440	So I was up, kinda organizing a lot of clipping stuff.
183440	185760	I was doing a lot of liaison stuff.
186800	188840	Back and forth.
188840	191080	If you didn't know, the girls have got
191080	192680	GamerSupps codes.
192680	196640	Everyone's descriptions are getting updated incredibly shortly,
196640	201640	but you can just use the girls' names, GamerSupps.
201640	204880	For 10% off and any earnings fully,
204880	207600	go to the girl, Vehler, do not take a cut.
207600	210400	No, no, no, no, Vehler, don't touch none of that.
210400	212120	All profits, all for them.
214160	216960	There will be a few tweets coming out
216960	218880	that the girls will interact with,
218880	220600	just to really solidify.
221880	226920	And then, yeah, I do apologize for yawning.
226920	229360	Vehler, GamerSupps, yes.
229400	231560	I did not yet ask permission,
231560	234840	if I'm allowed to talk about certain things yet,
234840	235800	so you're gonna have to forgive me,
235800	237760	but I can talk about something further
237760	239520	if I am giving it all clear.
241120	246120	Same applies to you, yes, CodeStrony at checkout.
247360	251600	Gives you 10% off and it gives me a kickback.
251600	254400	And I believe I'm gonna get a PR package,
254400	258560	so you might get a hand cam stream of me snorting it.
258560	261720	That's terrible, do not, no, I'm not actually.
262720	264320	GamerSupps already is huge.
264320	266360	Yes, they were incredibly kind.
268760	272360	I can talk a bit more once I get the green light
272360	276240	about a certain thing I would like to attempt,
276240	277720	but can't do that yet.
277720	279680	Time to get your anime thighs
279680	281840	or teddy milk sponsored by Vehler.
283640	287840	Well, there's a new flavor coming out on GamerSupps.
287840	292520	It might already be out and it's called anime thighs
292520	295760	and you might recognize someone's thighs on it.
295760	299360	It's not my thighs, no, someone else's thighs.
299360	304360	So, you know, if you were curious,
305840	308280	you might recognize someone's thighs on the packaging.
308280	312200	If it's already out, if it's not out, do not listen to me.
313480	314400	I think it's already out
314400	317160	because they gave us promotional artwork for it.
317200	321360	It's not Warmelon, no, it's not me, it's not my thighs.
321360	323960	Someone else's thighs of Vehler.
323960	325280	Peeler flavor when?
325280	326120	It's orange.
329360	332240	But yes, I do apologize if I'm a little sleepyhead today.
332240	337240	So, I just wanna say, if any of you make War Thunder videos,
338480	342440	my dad was watching you bomb things in War Thunder.
343320	345680	Pearly, thank you for the five gifted members
345680	348440	and congrats to those who cut them with their face.
348440	351400	I apologize for her squint, my hat,
351400	354680	my little tinfoil hat is horizontal.
354680	357920	That thing is spinning on an axis, that's terrible.
359800	363600	Yeah, he was watching War Thunder videos.
363600	365280	So, if you make War Thunder videos,
365280	367440	there's a chance my dad watched you.
367440	371400	We were also watching Australian car crashes,
372240	377240	and compilations, War Hammer, War Thunder.
378400	382760	War Thunder with the planes, my dad has planes.
384000	385200	He loves planes.
386720	389800	War Thunder leaked more documents again.
389800	391760	Honestly, that's hilarious.
391760	395520	It's actually my dad's, sorry, sorry, my dad's at it again.
395520	398360	I apologize, he just gets a bit overzealous
398360	400680	about the details on the planes and stuff.
400680	403280	You know, they have to be right, they have to be accurate.
406160	410000	And is he into the War Thunder Kiss Me loop?
410000	413560	No, he's into the let's test out nuclear bombs
413560	415840	and what happens when we drop them loop.
416720	418680	We were literally watching nuclear bombs
418680	421760	get dropped in the game, and I was like, oh yeah, curious.
423480	426640	And like honestly, the stuff my dad watches is hilarious.
426640	428800	So one minute we're watching nuclear bombs,
428800	431840	next minute we're watching car crash compilations
431840	435480	from Australia, because everyone's like, oh, you effing suit.
435480	437040	Like every time there's a crash.
437040	440080	And then we jumped over to the chef, what's his name?
440080	443600	The French Italian chef, it's like Jean Pierre or something.
443600	445600	And he goes, onion.
445600	449280	And we were like jumping between all these categories.
449280	452160	It was, I was getting flat, like, not flashbacks.
452160	454160	I was getting whipped around, honestly.
455480	457400	10 file foil hat, absolutely.
457520	459920	We're playing a game called Orwell.
459920	464920	If you didn't know, 1984 is a book by George Orwell.
466200	470760	And it's about how everything is in shambles, okay?
470760	472880	And we're about to play a game based on it.
472880	475320	Now, this is my only concern,
475320	479080	because I have not slept properly, Jean Pierre.
479080	482440	Ah, it's like a chef that's French and Italian.
483440	486800	The surveillance state, basically.
488800	492160	Because I've not slept, I don't know if my reading skills
492160	493840	are gonna be down dramatically.
493840	496160	Thank you again, Pearlie, for those gifted subs.
496160	497800	I appreciate you.
501400	506400	I actually need to check if I have any more emotes slots.
507320	509400	I might actually have more unlocked.
510400	512040	Just like real life.
512040	513640	Exactly, Reefling.
513640	515840	What's that about the high table?
515840	518960	Sean, you're gonna be so cooked on this one, honestly.
518960	522320	Right, so we're just gonna get into it.
522320	523680	It's a bit of a reading simulator,
523680	525200	but please don't worry, I'll read.
525200	527160	Please do tell me if the music's too loud
527160	530600	or anything over my life.
530600	533480	Don't record yourself peeing literally in 1984.
533480	536400	Okay, that's when you're allowed to be mad, so.
536400	538400	We're just starting a fresh, clean game.
538440	539440	We'll go from the start.
539440	540960	Is this game about surveillance?
540960	542880	That is, congratulations.
542880	545360	You've been selected for the Orwell test base.
545360	547560	Please create a profile, enter your name.
547560	551080	Big G, E, you know what, I'll put Reefling.
553440	555360	Reefling, next step.
555360	556880	Please choose a profile picture.
556880	559000	Reefling, what do you look like?
561320	563160	I guess that guy.
564360	565200	Are you old?
565200	566480	No, that's an OG, son.
568760	571200	Oh, this is like really weird.
572640	575240	Yeah, I guess that's you, Reefling.
575240	576080	Let's go.
581600	582600	Is that a joke?
585520	586920	Oh, it's not a joke.
586920	589320	Okay, let's say, can I just play the game?
589320	593280	Wait, oh, come on, that's a bit ironic.
593280	595400	Okay, that one was a bit ironic.
595400	596800	What the fuck was that?
597800	601440	No, the neck bear reddit mod, the old lady.
601440	603520	Shawnee, when do you have to make you do a sleep stream
603520	606080	just so we could finally, oh, honestly.
606080	607880	Please agree to the following terms.
607880	610200	I am aware my actions will severely impact
610200	613040	the lives of the citizens of the nation.
614040	617120	I will work thoroughly and judge objectively
617120	619600	to the best of my belief.
619600	622160	While working, I will adhere to the law and jurisdiction.
622160	623280	Yeah, sure, sure.
624480	625320	Setting up pro.
626800	628240	For ensuring the safety, thank you,
628240	631000	for ensuring the safety of the nation's people.
631000	633640	Your registration is now complete.
633640	635120	Please wait, logging in.
639000	640800	Freedom Plaza.
645920	648360	I would do a sleep and stream, but afar in my sleep.
649080	653360	Oh, my God, we're losing 1,000 social credit right now
653360	656000	in China, for even acknowledging the system.
662400	666520	Mummy, about to come to CIA, agent's best friend
666520	668640	exposed to all our degeneracy.
672080	673480	Enemy spotted.
673480	677360	Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
679360	680920	Oh, OK.
686880	689040	Oh, right, OK.
689040	690040	On a bus?
692240	694280	15 social credit purchasing,
694280	696480	being chilling ice cream is not illegal.
697680	698680	We're done for.
709360	713360	I completely forgot how this game.
714360	716360	I thought it was a text-based simulator.
716360	718360	Whoa, that's bright.
718360	721360	The clocks were striking 13.
721360	723360	That's not possible.
724360	727360	Eh, Symes, you're online.
727360	728360	Good.
728360	729360	Call me Symes.
729360	731360	I'll be your advisor on Orwell.
731360	734360	Together, we will form both the first and the last line
734360	736360	of defence against terrorism.
736360	739360	For the test phase, you are one of the first people
739360	744360	to try out the Orwell system under real circumstances.
744360	745360	Nothing happened.
745360	746360	Everything's normal, citizens.
746360	747360	Go back home.
748360	752360	Selected from thousands of applicants from across the globe.
752360	755360	Oh, and you picked me of all people with the tinfoil hat on.
755360	756360	I bet you did.
756360	758360	Normally, congratulations would be in order,
758360	760360	but as you can see from that footage,
760360	762360	there has been an incident.
762360	764360	So let's get started.
766360	769360	I've activated the reader tool for you.
769360	773360	Its purpose is storing bookmarks to online websites
773360	775360	and documents for easy access and to highlight
775360	777360	when there is new info to be investigated.
777360	781360	First, I want you to be informed of the situation.
781360	785360	Our leading newspaper, The National Beholder,
785360	787360	will bring you up to speed.
787360	790360	HR a bit lacking to be fair.
790360	794360	I feel like this game is about to have so many triggers.
795360	796360	All right, headlines.
796360	798360	Let's see what the headlines are loading.
798360	803360	So, Bomba obliterates freedom memorial and kills three.
803360	805360	Feel free to browse The National Beholder.
805360	810360	I've activated the pro-filer.

815360	818360	Nations in tri-filth, what?
818360	820360	Tri-filth failed?
821360	822360	Pay par...
822360	824360	Oh my God, I can't even read it all.
824360	826360	Par-gay-cyan.

838360	840360	Jeez, Louise.
841360	842360	Hey, Stormy.
842360	844360	I'm just coming from Sheevee's Twitter space.
844360	845360	It was really fun.
845360	846360	She highly recommends it.
846360	847360	What?
847360	848360	I'm using it.
848360	850360	Maybe shoot complete.
851360	852360	So, what does it say?
852360	856360	Proximately Wednesday evening, a device popped its clogs.
856360	860360	According to the official police reports, three folk were killed
860360	864360	and at least five bystanders were severely wounded.
864360	867360	The freedom memorial was nearly completely destroyed.
867360	869360	Police closed off the area.
869360	871360	Prime Minister Blaine immediately issued a press statement
871360	873360	and put the nation on high alert.
874360	878360	Study with the future.
878360	880360	She was using Twitter space to read miles.
880360	883360	Parmesan President.

885360	886360	Unknown person.
886360	887360	Date birth address.
887360	888360	Oh, okay.
888360	892360	The profile holds all known information on those we investigate.
892360	894360	The profile you've offered does our main suspect.
894360	898360	The blue-haired woman that the CCTV footage shows before the assault
898360	900360	is no stranger to the police.
900360	902360	Take a look at their arrest record.
903360	906360	Yes, I will take a look at the arrest record.
907360	908360	Where is it?
908360	909360	I'm clicking.
911360	912360	I'm clicking.
912360	913360	I don't want that to...
914360	915360	Um...
916360	918360	The arrest record.
918360	920360	I know exactly where that is.
920360	921360	Yes.
922360	923360	Yep.
923360	924360	Okay.
924360	925360	Log out.
925360	926360	Nope.
926360	927360	Don't close.
927360	928360	Right.
928360	929360	Hold on.
929360	930360	Hold on.
930360	931360	Hold on.
931360	932360	We're having a few issues.
932360	933360	Okay.
933360	935360	Watergate.
935360	937360	Watergate Cassandra.
937360	941360	The highlighted elements in the records are pieces of data that are able to be extracted.
941360	944360	We call these elements data chunks.
944360	949360	Hovering over data chunks will reveal their relevance to the case
949360	952360	and any connections or information it may influence.
952360	956360	Drop and drag all data chunks from the police database
956360	959360	into a profile to upload them to our servers.
959360	962360	So, Watergate Cassandra is a name.
962360	965360	So, we upload her name.
966360	967360	Yeah.
967360	968360	Okay.
968360	969360	So, her name's Cassandra.
969360	972360	Arrest date doesn't...
972360	975360	Suspect was arrested on site.
975360	977360	I don't see any other data chunk.
977360	978360	Oh, I guess her picture.
978360	979360	Sorry.
979360	981360	Of course, she has blue hair and pronouns.
981360	983360	Wait, unironically does she?
983360	984360	Very good.
984360	990360	Enter the names or critical information for Orwell to study a person and identify.
990360	993360	Information and documents can only become a data chunk
993360	996360	when it is clearly been assigned to a targeted person.
996360	1000360	Add the reason for Miss Watergate's prior arrest has just been unlocked.
1000360	1002360	We will need this info to progress.
1002360	1005360	So, she did assault on a police officer.
1005360	1007360	I came...
1007360	1009360	Where is my complimentary FBI hat?
1009360	1010360	No, no, no.
1010360	1011360	We're tinfoil here.
1011360	1012360	We're tinfoil gang.
1012360	1015360	With the data you extracted from the police record,
1015360	1017360	a new document can now be assessed.
1017360	1019360	Now, let me ask you a question.
1019360	1022360	Do you believe in coincidences?
1022360	1023360	I do not.
1023360	1025360	Find data revealing where she attacked the police officer
1025360	1027360	and you will see what I mean.
1027360	1029360	Okay, what?
1031360	1034360	Suspect was arrested on site after Officer Franklin
1034360	1036360	had been struck by an unknown object
1036360	1037360	and became unresponsive.
1037360	1040360	The protestor at the origin of the assault
1040360	1042360	was forcefully removed with the suspect
1042360	1044360	who saw kneeling and weeping on the ground.
1044360	1046360	When asked to lay on the ground with her hands behind her back,
1046360	1048360	the suspect cooperated immediately.
1048360	1051360	Wait, so she paid attention right away?
1051360	1053360	Why was she greeting?
1054360	1056360	Coincidence, I think.
1056360	1058360	No, yeah, why was she greeting?
1060360	1062360	Guess what, I don't know.
1063360	1064360	I'm not really sure.
1064360	1067360	Is this woman a terrorist?
1067360	1070360	Whoa, they're already printing it?
1070360	1072360	Women allegedly injured a police officer
1072360	1074360	two weeks ago remains in custody,
1074360	1076360	trial scheduled for August.
1076360	1078360	Wait, that's not possible.
1078360	1080360	The incident occurred during a rampage
1080360	1082360	at the Freedom Plaza as part of a demonstration,
1082360	1084360	so it's the same location again.
1086360	1088360	Freedom Plaza.
1088360	1090360	The exact same location as the assault,
1090360	1093360	then she turns up there right before the explosion,
1093360	1095360	surely not a coinky dink.
1095360	1097360	As you know, Miss Watergate's still running around freely.
1097360	1099360	We should find out why.
1099360	1102360	We should also gather more background information.
1102360	1104360	I want to know who we're really dealing with.
1106360	1108360	No, don't be sorry for being late, silly goers.
1108360	1110360	You're not late at all.
1110360	1112360	Who is an artist by profession.
1112360	1114360	Okay, so we've got a job.
1115360	1117360	Related document found.
1117360	1119360	Oh yes, one who does street art
1119360	1123360	by blowing memorials to pieces by any chance.
1123360	1125360	Okay, so she did.
1125360	1127360	Great, you've found another document.
1127360	1129360	Before we go on, let's clarify your job.
1129360	1131360	Again, we're just in the tutorial section,
1131360	1133360	so don't be surprised there's a few pop-ups, okay?
1133360	1135360	Great, you've found another document.
1135360	1136360	Before we go on, let's clarify your job
1136360	1138360	and how it affects mine, shall we?
1138360	1141360	You have extracted all the info I already knew about her.
1141360	1144360	Starting now, I'm going into it blind.
1144360	1147360	The Orwell ethical codex dictates
1147360	1149360	that investigators like yourself
1149360	1152360	are the only ones allowed to access documents
1152360	1154360	of targeted persons.
1154360	1157360	Advisors like me only get to see the data
1157360	1159360	provided by the investigators.
1159360	1162360	We will then draw conclusions and request action.
1162360	1164360	Your primary job is to provide information
1164360	1167360	you deem important, never give away
1167360	1169360	incorrect or misleading data.
1171360	1174360	You may hit disable on a data chunk
1174360	1176360	you do not want to pass on to Orwell.
1176360	1178360	However, some data chunks might be necessary
1178360	1180360	to progress on a case.
1181360	1182360	Curious.
1182360	1186360	So, we have the option to ignore
1186360	1190360	something we don't like.
1190360	1192360	So that's the exact same picture.
1194360	1196360	Due to the chaotic nature,
1196360	1198360	police have not yet been able to
1198360	1201360	connect the crime by the artist,
1201360	1203360	has denied the accusation completely
1203360	1205360	and has asked their fans to show their support.
1205360	1207360	A trial has now been scheduled for mid-August.
1208360	1212360	Ooh, fancy.
1213360	1216360	Cassandra's portfolio.
1216360	1218360	Oh, I've got a new four-wall brochure.
1219360	1221360	Shoving new four-wall on her.
1221360	1223360	She's very smiley.
1223360	1224360	Oh, just for play.
1224360	1225360	Wait, you know what?
1225360	1227360	Oh no, we've got multiple if we wanted this one.
1228360	1230360	The accusatory.
1230360	1232360	Hmm, something's not going on here.
1232360	1234360	There's no such thing as a coincidence.
1234360	1236360	It's been a hot minute since the last
1236360	1237360	was this game.
1237360	1239360	I wonder if you can frame people.
1239360	1240360	Hi, I'm Cassandra.
1240360	1242360	A colorful inhabitant of Wonderland
1242360	1244360	right behind the rainbow.
1244360	1245360	Bet you are.
1245360	1246360	Glad you found me.
1246360	1248360	Finally found the courage to quit my dull
1248360	1249360	and focus on art career.
1249360	1251360	So she's an artist.
1254360	1256360	My U-Tail account.
1256360	1258360	Well, that's her job,
1258360	1260360	so I guess she can be an artist.
1261360	1262360	Previously, Claire job.
1262360	1263360	Yeah, that's fine.
1263360	1264360	Hmm, interesting.
1264360	1266360	Find out what job that was.
1266360	1269360	And then my account name is this.
1269360	1271360	Wonderlandster.
1271360	1273360	She reminds me of Nikki from Honeycap.
1273360	1275360	No, Nikki, but the bad end.
1275360	1276360	Good, you found a chat handle.
1276360	1278360	That will allow us to overhear any conversations
1278360	1279360	on that account.
1281360	1283360	How far fetched is this?
1283360	1285360	Surely this doesn't occur in real life,
1285360	1287360	and this is all fantasy based.
1287360	1289360	Anyway, hydration check, briefly.
1291360	1293360	The listener
1293360	1295360	has now been unlocked.
1295360	1297360	New conversations will appear
1297360	1299360	whenever they are started.
1299360	1301360	So we're going to listen in
1301360	1303360	on a conversation.
1303360	1305360	Oh, she's not online.
1307360	1309360	Well, I guess, no.
1309360	1310360	What's she got?
1310360	1311360	She's got pudders.
1311360	1313360	My beloved furball.
1313360	1315360	Kikiko.
1315360	1317360	Kikiko.
1317360	1319360	Kikiko.
1319360	1320360	Yep, the beaut is me.
1320360	1322360	I was never sure about the title,
1322360	1324360	Businessman's Forgotten Daughter.
1324360	1326360	Daughter of an in-entrepreneur.
1330360	1332360	Very...
1332360	1334360	Oh, listener.
1334360	1336360	Who's she talking to?
1336360	1338360	Hey, you.
1338360	1340360	Hey, Jossie.
1340360	1342360	Dot, dot, dot.
1342360	1344360	Oh, he's typing, sorry.
1344360	1346360	I can't seem to find my credit card.
1346360	1348360	I assume you took it right.
1348360	1350360	You got me, Sherlock.
1350360	1352360	Put the cat in the database.
1354360	1356360	Oh, is this her man?
1356360	1358360	I'm in the middle of buying all the Boston
1358360	1360360	with that platinum card.
1360360	1361360	I lifted.
1361360	1364360	Stolen a credit card from an unknown person.
1364360	1366360	I think that's her boo.
1366360	1368360	I don't... I don't think we...
1368360	1369360	We say that.
1369360	1370360	We're lucky for you.
1370360	1372360	I don't mind you going on a splurge
1372360	1374360	as long as you pick up some wine for dinner.
1374360	1375360	Yeah, they're mine.
1375360	1377360	Wine, what does Yosef Langley,
1377360	1379360	my fearless attorney,
1380360	1382360	and all-round badass have...
1383360	1385360	create new profiles?
1385360	1387360	Sure, that's on him.
1388360	1389360	Okay.
1390360	1392360	You now have a profile and a related person.
1392360	1394360	It could be access for you as a profiler.
1394360	1397360	Date chunks will only appear for target persons.
1397360	1399360	Okay, okay, that's fine, that's fine, that's fine though.
1399360	1401360	Let's get back into her.
1402360	1404360	Guess I better pick up tons of wine.
1404360	1406360	You'll have to get this client of yours
1406360	1408360	pretty buzzed to handle all that business.
1408360	1410360	One bottle should be fine, she's a lightweight.
1411360	1413360	Okay, I guess I shouldn't pick up some of those
1413360	1414360	party pills from Big Pharma.
1414360	1415360	Aki, my parent.
1415360	1416360	Daughter of...
1416360	1417360	Ooh!
1418360	1419360	Wait.
1419360	1421360	If you have Big Pharma parents,
1421360	1422360	what the fuck is...
1422360	1424360	Watergate Pharma, that does ring a bell.
1424360	1425360	Ooh!
1426360	1427360	Yeah, maybe.
1427360	1428360	Gotta go now, text you later.
1428360	1429360	Exo, exo!
1430360	1431360	She's dating...
1434360	1436360	A date from my darling.
1436360	1438360	She's in a relationship, okay.
1441360	1443360	Well, it was supposed to be...
1443360	1445360	Okay, there we go, we've scraped this website,
1445360	1446360	so we're gonna go back.
1447360	1448360	Procedure...
1448360	1450360	Closing raises...
1450360	1452360	Manipulation speculation.
1452360	1453360	Oh, that's her boo.
1455360	1457360	Orwell informs me you just encountered
1457360	1459360	conflicting data chunks.
1459360	1461360	Whenever the content of two data chunks
1461360	1463360	are odds with one another,
1463360	1465360	they will be shown as a conflict.
1466360	1468360	When you extract one of the data chunks,
1468360	1470360	containing a conflict,
1470360	1473360	the others will become invalid immediately.
1473360	1475360	I'd highly recommend that you clarify
1475360	1477360	in the context before you proceed.
1477360	1479360	Though this is your decision,
1479360	1482360	once information's been parsed,
1482360	1485360	there is no way to reverse the choice.
1485360	1486360	Okay.
1486360	1488360	Are we ready?
1488360	1490360	Oh, let's not fuck up.
1490360	1491360	Am I in the way?
1491360	1492360	I need to be smaller.
1493360	1495360	I don't want to be too small.
1495360	1496360	I don't know.
1496360	1499360	I don't know if I made myself smaller or made it worse.
1499360	1500360	Okay.
1501360	1503360	The case that is almost the center media attention
1503360	1504360	last month's come to an end.
1504360	1507360	Cassandra was acquitted for allegedly assault
1507360	1509360	with the case being closed due to lack of evidence.
1509360	1511360	However, the case might be reopened
1511360	1513360	with new evidence being discovered.
1513360	1515360	The suspect's lawyer,
1515360	1518360	at no point has there been any valid evidence
1518360	1519360	that my client was guilty.
1519360	1520360	No point at all.
1521360	1523360	Meanwhile, the relatives of the victim
1523360	1525360	expressed their disappointment on hearing
1525360	1527360	the result of the lawsuit.
1527360	1529360	They openly voiced concerns that
1529360	1531360	the wealthy family of the accused
1531360	1535360	might have influenced her favor.
1535360	1537360	The victim, a father of two...
1537360	1539360	Well, actually, I'm inclined to believe
1539360	1541360	there was lack of evidence because she was
1541360	1543360	beaten and she didn't resist the rest.
1543360	1547360	So, I'm actually going to submit this one.
1548360	1550360	But she was green.
1550360	1552360	And she didn't resist.
1552360	1554360	If you resist, then, yeah.
1554360	1555360	This is what I figure.
1555360	1558360	A pity that the CCTV did not actually help.
1558360	1560360	Maybe it will today.
1562360	1564360	So, how do I...
1564360	1566360	add her re-boyfriend?
1568360	1569360	You.
1570360	1572360	Doesn't let me add his face?
1572360	1573360	No?
1573360	1574360	Okay.
1574360	1575360	I don't undo that.
1575360	1576360	Hold on.
1576360	1578360	Right, back to her, back to her.
1579360	1580360	You don't have to resist
1580360	1582360	in your above-law correlation causation.
1582360	1583360	Indeed.
1583360	1584360	Why would someone...
1584360	1586360	Why would someone, by their full name,
1587360	1588360	one month member...
1588360	1589360	What?
1590360	1592360	What are you saying?
1592360	1594360	Time to become big brother.
1594360	1596360	Steady on, penthouse.
1596360	1597360	Amy's back, don't worry.
1597360	1598360	Right.
1598360	1599360	What is this?
1599360	1601360	Watergate pharmaceuticals.
1601360	1603360	Let's just have a little...
1603360	1605360	Ooh, lots of...
1605360	1607360	Oh, that's what you use to regain your...
1608360	1610360	See if your brain can put together
1610360	1612360	what the joke I'm forming.
1613360	1615360	Okay, let's check you out.
1615360	1616360	The company.
1617360	1619360	Ooh, is it her dad?
1622360	1623360	No?
1626360	1629360	That was before she got...
1629360	1632360	No, no, she got blue hair to symbolize.
1632360	1633360	She's radicalized.
1633360	1634360	Get wrecked.
1634360	1636360	That's hilarious.
1636360	1638360	So, she was...
1638360	1640360	Is that actually the same person?
1640360	1642360	She got fucking radicalized
1642360	1644360	and now she's blue.
1645360	1646360	Okay.
1647360	1648360	Well, she was the junior.
1648360	1649360	She's giving it up.
1649360	1651360	Right, her mom and dad.
1654360	1655360	Her mom and dad.
1655360	1656360	Okay, I see.
1656360	1658360	Now, keeping it a family affair.
1658360	1659360	So...
1659360	1660360	Update.
1660360	1661360	Junior...
1661360	1663360	No, she left it.
1663360	1665360	Documents that you already have reviewed
1665360	1667360	maybe update from time to time as events unfold.
1667360	1669360	The reader will notify you when that happens.
1669360	1671360	The National Beholder just published
1671360	1672360	a new article.
1672360	1674360	You may want to take a look
1674360	1676360	and see if there's any new information available.
1676360	1677360	Curious.
1678360	1680360	Is there anything else on the jobs?
1680360	1681360	Can I get hired?
1681360	1682360	Not...
1682360	1683360	Not, you know, feeling it?
1683360	1684360	Okay, fine.
1685360	1686360	Fine, fine.
1686360	1689360	So yeah, this is basically a click simulator,
1689360	1690360	but yeah.
1690360	1692360	Crane breaks continue to drop.
1692360	1693360	The bomb.
1694360	1696360	Wait, am I supposed to invest together?
1697360	1698360	The safety bill.
1698360	1699360	Go on then.
1699360	1700360	What's the safety bill?
1700360	1701360	I wanna know.
1702360	1703360	What's the safety bill?
1703360	1704360	Crimes pair.
1705360	1706360	The safety bill is passed.
1706360	1708360	The party is elected to government.
1708360	1709360	Ooh.
1710360	1711360	Nineteen.
1711360	1712360	Eight.
1712360	1713360	So you mean to tell me that this woman
1713360	1715360	quit her QC100K job
1715360	1716360	to pursue art?
1716360	1717360	Honestly.
1718360	1719360	Honestly.
1719360	1720360	Honestly.
1722360	1723360	The...
1723360	1725360	Parge is peacekeeping.
1725360	1727360	Oh, the parge is the baddies.
1728360	1730360	Goodness me.
1730360	1732360	Talk about readings in your ear.
1732360	1734360	Wait, the headline says it's got an update,
1734360	1735360	but we are on this one.
1738360	1740360	It might be introled.
1740360	1741360	There's a red symbol.
1741360	1742360	I did get updated.
1745360	1746360	Hmm.
1746360	1747360	I'm missing something.
1750360	1751360	What?
1752360	1754360	It says there's something here.
1754360	1756360	It must be to do with the safety bill, no?
1757360	1758360	There's a bit of information
1758360	1760360	we're supposed to be extracting here,
1760360	1761360	and I can't find it.
1763360	1764360	Come on, game high.
1764360	1765360	Light it for me so I thought
1765360	1767360	to use my brain.
1768360	1769360	Due to recent stabilization,
1769360	1770360	we've been able to reduce
1770360	1772360	the number of station guards.
1772360	1773360	Okay.
1774360	1775360	Participate.
1777360	1778360	Become a party.
1779360	1780360	What?
1780360	1782360	Safety bill, just temporary, so.
1783360	1785360	Whoa, we've got the leaders.
1786360	1789360	Look at all those people and stuff.
1789360	1791360	Parge is peacekeeping.
1791360	1792360	Okay, we get it.
1792360	1793360	We get it, good, good.
1793360	1795360	I don't see any information position.
1795360	1797360	The five pillars of the great nation.
1798360	1800360	Safety and security.
1800360	1802360	Economy and commerce.
1802360	1804360	Values and tradition.
1804360	1807360	Migration and foreign affairs.
1807360	1809360	Education and health.
1809360	1811360	The five pillars.
1811360	1813360	Okay, okay, we get it.
1815360	1816360	Right.
1819360	1821360	What does that blue mean at company?
1828360	1829360	What does the blue mean,
1829360	1831360	that this information, can I not?
1833360	1835360	Well, she is an artist.
1837360	1840360	I guess that way everything stays in the family.
1840360	1842360	Being an artist and a junior seems a bit odd.
1842360	1844360	She also mentioned she'd quit a dull job.
1844360	1846360	Yeah, okay, well that's why I didn't put that down
1846360	1847360	because she quit it.
1847360	1848360	Okay.
1848360	1849360	Okay, I'm starting to get it.
1849360	1850360	I'm starting to get it.
1850360	1851360	Right, jobs.
1852360	1853360	What's going on here?
1853360	1856360	We are urgently looking for a replacement.
1856360	1857360	Okay.
1859360	1861360	You gotta go back to work, Rip.
1861360	1863360	Thank you for hanging though.
1863360	1864360	Please don't worry, this is a bit of a,
1864360	1866360	this is rather low energy.
1866360	1868360	We're gonna have a lot more fun streams next week,
1868360	1869360	I promise.
1869360	1871360	Or maybe I was wrong and nothing stays in the family.
1871360	1874360	Yup, this is probably what she meant by quitting her job.
1874360	1875360	Good.
1876360	1879360	Ooh, currently I'm thinking that our Miss Watergate
1879360	1882360	underwent quite a radical change, don't you agree?
1882360	1883360	Let's find out what happened
1883360	1885360	in between these two lives of hers.
1885360	1887360	What may have caused this shift?
1887360	1889360	Let's find out.
1889360	1892360	Because that timelines, what's timelines?
1893360	1896360	Oh, it's like Facebook.
1897360	1898360	Oh my God.
1898360	1901360	1992, she's old.
1903360	1907360	Do you remember in September?
1909360	1911360	I love the soft spoken art.
1911360	1914360	It's not the soft, me is just exhausted.
1914360	1917360	Look at all those, look at all those Eggman's profile.
1918360	1921360	She has an interest in art music and activism.
1921360	1923360	Well, there you go.
1923360	1924360	It's not that old.
1924360	1926360	1992, hag, that's weird.
1926360	1929360	Art music and activism, what a line up.
1932360	1934360	She only just called me old.
1934360	1936360	I don't mean that you're older.
1936360	1937360	I like it.
1937360	1939360	What do you mean someone so young and tiny
1939360	1942360	has so much control over you?
1942360	1945360	I mean, they mess up over a little bit.
1947360	1950360	Sorry, 1992, bro, is what you're old.
1950360	1951360	Yes, I'm old.
1951360	1953360	Bones are decaying.
1953360	1955360	They're becoming like powder.
1955360	1958360	Woohoo, first day freed and far away from the shackles.
1958360	1961360	So she didn't like her jab.
1962360	1966360	Despite, oh, despite puppets,
1966360	1970360	the spies you have finally managed to destroy.
1970360	1971360	So there's nothing left to do.
1971360	1972360	You can get there.
1972360	1974360	My person wishes for you deep as the best.
1975360	1977360	Opposes the government.
1978360	1979360	What's the matter?
1979360	1982360	That doesn't sound like you haven't hung out for ages.
1983360	1986360	Mary, shut your frickin' mouth, okay?
1986360	1989360	I'm not in the mood for your stupid act.
1989360	1991360	I told you again and again.
1991360	1993360	I can't deal with this right now.
1994360	1995360	You know what?
1995360	1997360	I'm really sorry that I still care about my best friend.
1997360	2000360	No matter how often she decides to give me the cold shoulder.
2000360	2003360	Because she's in a relationship.
2003360	2005360	Okay, we can confirm that.
2007360	2011360	You're randomly with the lawyer who might be noteworthy.
2011360	2016360	Is this the beholder?
2017360	2019360	Yeah, no, we knew it was him.
2019360	2022360	Hold on, go back to the timeline, please.
2022360	2024360	Right, you opposed the government.
2024360	2026360	No, no, no, can't have that.
2026360	2029360	Being against the government is very sus.
2029360	2034360	Well, well, Miss Watergate, we aren't too fond of you either.
2035360	2038360	Conflicting data.
2038360	2041360	I don't know what the conflict is, though.
2041360	2043360	At least you are redeemed.
2043360	2045360	I want to blow off some steam together late night shopping.
2045360	2047360	Not today, I have a date this evening.
2047360	2048360	Ooh, who's the lucky one?
2048360	2050360	Case closed, congrats.
2050360	2051360	I never had any.
2051360	2053360	Wait, Mary just seems really nice.
2053360	2056360	Oh my God, isn't that the singer of the gorillas?
2057360	2059360	Failed goods.
2061360	2063360	Failed goods.
2063360	2065360	Camels looking down on the camel's back.
2065360	2067360	Hydration check.
2069360	2071360	You know who I mean, though.
2071360	2073360	I forgot his name.
2076360	2077360	Okay, what's looking...
2077360	2078360	Oh, here we go.
2078360	2082360	Cassandra Shobin of the world is singing now.
2084360	2086360	The concert is amazing, amazing.
2086360	2088360	I just had to give my hair a little makeover,
2088360	2090360	so without further ado, how do you like it?
2090360	2092360	Okay, so she changed her hair for a concert.
2093360	2094360	Cassie's gone punk.
2094360	2097360	Did Momay and Daddy agree with that?
2097360	2098360	Eggs, D.
2098360	2099360	Looks nice.
2101360	2102360	What new you?
2102360	2104360	You also need a new name.
2104360	2105360	What about this?
2105360	2106360	That's the spirit girl now.
2106360	2108360	I'd like to invite you to our little activist group
2108360	2109360	if you want to join us.
2109360	2111360	It would be nice to have you in the protest.
2112360	2113360	Oh my God.
2113360	2115360	I can't believe that the gorillas are against the government.
2118360	2119360	An activist group.
2119360	2121360	Is there anything more specific?
2122360	2124360	So hence what Cassandra Shobin known to the world is
2124360	2125360	Cassarthus.
2130360	2132360	It's not going to actually update her name.
2133360	2134360	Is this like a code name?
2134360	2136360	You guys get given code names?
2138360	2139360	An alias.
2139360	2140360	Okay, okay, okay.
2141360	2142360	An alias name.
2142360	2144360	You know people on the web.
2144360	2146360	So many names, so many identities.
2146360	2148360	It's always good to recover or record any alias.
2148360	2150360	Then we can match data chunks.
2150360	2151360	Okay.
2151360	2152360	Oh, there's a conversation.
2153360	2154360	Did I miss a conversation?
2156360	2157360	Oops, I did.
2157360	2158360	Oh no, here we go.
2158360	2159360	Recording starts.
2159360	2160360	Let's go.
2161360	2163360	Hey, did you hear about the
2164360	2165360	La Bomba?
2167360	2168360	Yeah, don't remind me.
2168360	2169360	You know I have history with that place.
2170360	2172360	So she's saying she wasn't there.
2173360	2174360	The plot thickens.
2175360	2176360	She's going by girls.
2177360	2178360	Already messing with me.
2179360	2181360	Enough that I have to catch a bus from there every day.
2182360	2183360	Catches a bus every day.
2184360	2186360	Okay, so we have evidence of her being at the location
2187360	2188360	due to that bus comment.
2189360	2191360	Meaning her presence there before the Bomba
2192360	2193360	could be a coincidence after all.
2194360	2196360	I'll reserve my thoughts and tell more evidence.
2197360	2198360	I'm so
2199360	2200360	co-member of thought,
2201360	2202360	member of a group of people
2202360	2203360	who have thought,
2204360	2205360	member of a group called thought.
2207360	2209360	If you would not have gone to the protest,
2210360	2211360	you never would have been wrongfully,
2212360	2214360	we'll keep that information wherever that is.
2215360	2216360	You are not a,
2217360	2219360	whoa, an activist group called thought,
2220360	2221360	interesting, maybe this is what,
2222360	2223360	the thought police, but the other way.
2224360	2225360	We should find something that shows
2226360	2227360	our current attitude to see if we're following
2228360	2229360	the right person.
2230360	2231360	Yeah, I would not have been called
2232360	2233360	an activist in all the papers.
2234360	2235360	You are not one, okay?
2236360	2237360	Aren't I?
2238360	2239360	You sure?
2240360	2241360	Yeah, I'm pretty sure.
2242360	2243360	Ka-ching!
2244360	2245360	What?
2246360	2247360	Is that supposed to be my credit card
2248360	2249360	and the cash register?
2250360	2251360	Something like that, I guess.
2252360	2253360	I hope you, like, a
2254360	2255360	shatoo-monger.
2256360	2257360	And me just cringed, I'm sorry.
2258360	2259360	Great.
2260360	2261360	So you've decided to bankrupt me.
2262360	2263360	I'm your boyfriend, Yosef.
2264360	2265360	Uh, okay.
2267360	2268360	Here's the thing,
2269360	2270360	I've got an important appointment tonight.
2271360	2272360	It's surprisingly out on my schedule
2273360	2274360	and I can't postpone it.
2275360	2276360	Postpone it!
2277360	2278360	You've gotta be kidding me!
2279360	2280360	I want that thing!
2281360	2282360	I'm very sorry, darling.
2283360	2284360	We'll have to see each other tomorrow, Cookie.
2285360	2286360	You always have an appointment
2287360	2288360	exclamation mark one.
2289360	2290360	Appointment here, appointment there,
2290360	2291360	appointment fucking everywhere!
2292360	2295360	How can you constantly do this to me?
2296360	2297360	Darling, please just calm down.
2298360	2300360	Have you taken your drugs?
2301360	2302360	Oh my god.
2303360	2306360	Suspect is, is on, on drugs.
2307360	2308360	Wait, can you look that up for me?
2309360	2310360	Yeah, yeah, in a minute.
2311360	2312360	Fine.
2313360	2314360	If you don't show up at the appointment,
2315360	2317360	I risk losing a very important appointment.
2318360	2319360	Is he cheating on her?
2320360	2321360	You know, I feel like if you're a lawyer,
2322360	2323360	you have to make time for,
2324360	2325360	if a client comes first and through your doors,
2326360	2327360	you have to deal with it there and then.
2328360	2329360	No, no, I totally understand.
2330360	2332360	Don't you risk losing that very important client.
2333360	2334360	Don't be like that.
2335360	2336360	Come on, you know the, the de-fire.
2337360	2338360	The de-fire!
2339360	2340360	I get it.
2341360	2342360	I guess I'm just not an important client anymore.
2343360	2344360	Oh, come on, Kathy.
2345360	2346360	Going home now in case I'm getting up
2347360	2348360	on that priority list.
2348360	2349360	Please.
2350360	2351360	And then the session,
2352360	2353360	this one goes right.
2354360	2355360	Let's go figure out the product
2356360	2357360	that began with an M,
2358360	2359360	anti-depressant.
2360360	2361360	Oh no, she's so volatile
2362360	2363360	on anti-depressants.
2364360	2365360	Yeah, so I think we're going to be fine.
2366360	2367360	Oh, I clicked off that.
2368360	2369360	Looking at what you've experienced so far,
2370360	2372360	we're dealing with a potentially dangerous personality.
2373360	2374360	I will indicate that to law enforcement.
2375360	2376360	What?
2376360	2377360	What are you doing?
2378360	2379360	What anti-depressants?
2380360	2381360	Right.
2382360	2383360	I don't know what the conflicting thing is
2384360	2385360	with this Mary.
2386360	2387360	Having an amazing tour with Mary,
2388360	2389360	my best friend.
2390360	2391360	Right.
2392360	2393360	So she says best friend
2394360	2396360	and this is her with brown hair
2397360	2398360	at the best friend stage.
2404360	2405360	Just discovered this new band
2406360	2407360	The Targets, Man in the Rock.
2408360	2409360	Who's coming?
2410360	2411360	Punk's not my style.
2412360	2413360	Sorry, can't we just go see cherry cheeks sometime?
2414360	2415360	Well, you can see my cherry cheeks
2416360	2417360	any day we film.
2418360	2419360	They are just not some punks.
2420360	2421360	Their lead singers are real cutie
2422360	2423360	and they've got a...
2424360	2425360	Plus they've got a message.
2426360	2427360	Why not?
2428360	2429360	No, sorry, it's not for me.
2430360	2431360	And then what?
2432360	2433360	She starts changing.
2434360	2435360	Oh my God, what happened to you?
2437360	2440360	Oh, she's not replying to Mary at all here.
2442360	2443360	Congrats, I never had any doubts.
2445360	2447360	Oh, but she's not replying to Mary here.
2448360	2449360	She's only replying to Juliet and
2450360	2451360	Guerrilla Man.
2454360	2455360	Oh, they did fall out.
2458360	2459360	They have a broken friendship
2460360	2461360	because Cassandra's been a weirdo.
2463360	2464360	Guerrilla Man.
2464360	2465360	Yeah, broken house ad.
2466360	2467360	Yeah, and she got radicalized
2468360	2469360	and doesn't want to talk to her pal anymore.
2470360	2471360	Right, the thoughts.
2472360	2473360	The thoughts are free.
2474360	2475360	If liberty means anything at all,
2476360	2477360	it means the right to tell people
2478360	2479360	what they do not want to hear.
2480360	2481360	George Orwell.
2482360	2483360	It's thickened.
2484360	2485360	Oh my God.
2486360	2487360	Step one, secure the case.
2488360	2489360	Okay.
2490360	2491360	This is forbidden.
2492360	2493360	Oh no, is everything broken?
2494360	2495360	Let's do that.
2496360	2497360	Oh, there's her alias name.
2500360	2501360	Oh, she's already linked to all her stuff.
2502360	2503360	We know about you.
2505360	2506360	Step eight, Rizloth.
2507360	2508360	For you, Mason.
2509360	2510360	Not for me.
2511360	2512360	Need to get some work done today.
2513360	2514360	I'll have to catch the rest of the blood.
2515360	2516360	Okay, thank you for hanging.
2517360	2518360	Please don't worry, this is very, very low energy game.
2519360	2520360	So this is just chilling in the background stuff.
2521360	2522360	So don't worry.
2522360	2523360	We're even at Freedom Plaza.
2524360	2525360	Is that just me?
2526360	2527360	Or is that ironic?
2528360	2529360	You probably all know me.
2530360	2531360	It's either that blue-haired punk bi-youch.
2533360	2534360	Oh my God.
2535360	2536360	These are only some of the names
2537360	2538360	that we called during the criminal investigation.
2539360	2540360	That was because in the middle of the chaos,
2541360	2542360	someone believed to have seen me hurt an officer.
2543360	2545360	It never even occurred to anybody that it wasn't me.
2546360	2548360	We were there because we wanted a peaceful protest.
2549360	2550360	We have always been against violence.
2550360	2551360	Hmm.
2552360	2553360	And what's the conflicting data?
2554360	2555360	One would assume that in the age where
2556360	2557360	all the camps are everywhere,
2558360	2559360	I don't even find the conflicting piece.
2562360	2563360	By goldfells.
2566360	2567360	Where's the conflicting piece of information?
2571360	2572360	Alright, someone called Guest.
2573360	2574360	Hey, interesting name by the way.
2575360	2576360	Just stumbled upon your new blog and some truth here.
2577360	2578360	The web was born in the sense of ultimate freedom
2579360	2580360	to be who you want to be and express yourself.
2581360	2582360	Now that the government has threatened this
2583360	2584360	with real name policies and stuff,
2585360	2586360	saves your IP, so you can look up who you are.
2587360	2588360	Wasn't there...
2589360	2590360	Right, okay, this is Tinfoil Talk.
2591360	2592360	This is me, Tinfoil Talk.
2593360	2594360	I'm sure I saw a post that was like,
2595360	2599360	oh, sweet man-made thing beyond my comprehension.
2600360	2604360	And it was like, your PC can clock your room details
2605360	2606360	and the inside schematics of your house.
2606360	2608360	And I'm like, 99% sure that got proved
2609360	2613360	because it has like, something with it that can do that.
2614360	2616360	But I don't know if that's Tinfoil or if that's real real
2617360	2619360	and I fell for like a coffee past or something.
2621360	2623360	Oh, sweet man-made horrors beyond my comprehension.
2624360	2625360	Yay!
2626360	2627360	The best part of this game is when you start getting
2628360	2630360	how bad all the things are and you're doing the spine.
2631360	2633360	It can be done now, yeah, they use your router, yeah.
2633360	2636360	Yeah, hardware, back doors, and tracking every device.
2637360	2638360	Rep.
2639360	2640360	Okay, I thought I was making it up, but I guess it's real.
2641360	2642360	Hello, admin.
2643360	2644360	I'd like to say, could you be one...
2645360	2646360	To get a service on search engine, other...
2647360	2648360	Oh, is this just a fucking random mail?
2649360	2650360	What do you say?
2651360	2652360	Well, if you don't have one before,
2653360	2654360	you've just gained yourself your first follower.
2655360	2656360	Okay, let's go on his profile.
2660360	2662360	Hmm, it's got five articles.
2664360	2667360	Okay, and I'm guessing all the archive ones are inaccessible.
2668360	2670360	So, this has got conflicting.
2671360	2673360	There's a conflicting with show the conflict.
2674360	2675360	No, I don't know where it is.
2678360	2680360	No, it's not showing me where it is.
2681360	2683360	Oh, no, I'm gonna have to find it like a good girl.
2685360	2686360	Finally, someone who has the...
2693360	2694360	Oh, you've kind of fucked up with that one.
2695360	2696360	I have to admit.
2697360	2698360	You can't say you're about peace,
2699360	2700360	but then go on Facebook and be like,
2701360	2702360	XD.
2703360	2704360	Finally, someone who has the grit and explosives
2705360	2708360	to show how futile surveillance is.
2711360	2715360	C's assault justified for showing the futility of the surveillance.
2716360	2717360	Ooh.
2721360	2722360	Really cat?
2723360	2724360	You're laughing at people being killed.
2725360	2726360	Are you out of your mind?
2727360	2730360	Yeah, I'm sorry, but, bro, that's very tasteless.
2733360	2734360	I suspected as much.
2735360	2736360	Seems like we're looking at the right person.
2737360	2738360	I don't think it was her that did it,
2739360	2741360	but she's a sympathizer.
2742360	2743360	All right.
2743360	2745360	What we've found out so far is a good and interesting,
2746360	2748360	but I think we should be searching for something a little more concrete.
2749360	2751360	We have to dig deeper.
2752360	2753360	Okay.
2754360	2755360	Listening into a conversation.
2756360	2757360	Absolutely.
2758360	2759360	Juliet.
2760360	2761360	Hello.
2762360	2763360	Hi, Jules.
2764360	2765360	Is this so much fellow?
2766360	2767360	Cass, I just want to know.
2768360	2769360	Wanted to know.
2770360	2771360	You're post on timelines about the assault.
2771360	2773360	You really shouldn't write stuff like that.
2774360	2777360	Really, Jules, you're not going to preach to me about this stupid post, are you?
2778360	2779360	No.
2780360	2781360	I just wanted to know what's wrong, Cass.
2782360	2784360	It's nothing just between the two of us.
2788360	2790360	I just had to let off steam, you know?
2791360	2792360	It's because of what happened, isn't it?
2793360	2795360	Yeah, and lots and lots of other stuff, too.
2798360	2800360	The bombing stirred up all this crap again.
2801360	2803360	You know, what I did.
2804360	2805360	What did you do?
2806360	2808360	What happened there wasn't your fault.
2809360	2810360	Hey, Miss Tinfoil, what's the game about?
2811360	2812360	Tinfoil?
2813360	2814360	You'll never guess.
2815360	2816360	Tinfoil?
2817360	2820360	Cass, you hurt that officer to save me and you succeeded.
2821360	2822360	You mustn't forget about that.
2823360	2824360	How can it not have been my fault?
2825360	2827360	Juliet, I smashed a freaking skull of a father because I lost it.
2828360	2829360	Wait, what?
2830360	2833360	Admit guilt towards for having injured the officer.
2835360	2836360	To protect them.
2837360	2840360	Well, it was a protection job, so I'll let you.
2841360	2843360	I'll let you injure the officer to protect.
2844360	2845360	What? Where did that come from?
2846360	2848360	This is perfect. We can arrest her and open the investigation again.
2849360	2852360	However, we probably won't be able to hold her for long if that really happened in defense.
2853360	2854360	Very good work.
2855360	2857360	The intervention team is already on its way.
2857360	2859360	We'll need to wait for confirmation.
2860360	2866360	If Miss Water, in Miss Water Gates case, it was not a problem to get her dressed.
2867360	2870360	With the help of local police due to her former record.
2871360	2873360	Oh, Sheevie's getting a clip of her burp, by the way.
2874360	2875360	I just let you guys should know that.
2876360	2880360	And Amy sent me clips of her feet, so don't be shocked when you see shots like that.
2881360	2883360	I feel like a butthole and worse kind of butthole.
2884360	2885360	I might be free, but not right.
2885360	2886360	I'm not innocent.
2887360	2888360	Okay, nobody's innocent.
2889360	2890360	You'll have to let go.
2891360	2892360	Okay, we're learning.
2893360	2894360	Oh, wait, she's going back onto her.
2895360	2897360	It was a bit late in finding that info.
2898360	2900360	Five minutes later, Miss Timfoyle, or oh, she.
2901360	2902360	FBI, open up.
2903360	2904360	I thought about what you said.
2905360	2906360	Maybe you're right. I should take the post down.
2907360	2908360	Oh, we've already reported it.
2909360	2910360	You're a bit too late.
2911360	2912360	It would be better.
2913360	2914360	Believe me.
2915360	2916360	Are you getting taken down in real time?
2919360	2920360	FBI, open up.
2922360	2924360	By the way, how is your boyfriend?
2927360	2928360	You're still together.
2929360	2930360	You haven't been talking about him that much lately.
2931360	2932360	Well, not as much as before.
2933360	2936360	Oh my God, we're about to literally get it live streamed to us.
2937360	2938360	Hello?
2939360	2940360	Are you still there?
2941360	2942360	Too late, strong and co-locked you.
2943360	2946360	I'll inquire if all went well with arresting Miss Wargate.
2947360	2948360	You did a good job in any case.
2949360	2951360	Although we have no proof she's involved in the bomba.
2952360	2953360	We might be able to question her.
2954360	2955360	Despite acting in defense of Australia,
2956360	2959360	she seems to be quite unstable and unstable.
2960360	2961360	She's on anti-depressants.
2962360	2963360	She's just, you know,
2964360	2965360	seeing the world for what it is.
2966360	2968360	Okay, I just received information she's in custody.
2969360	2970360	Good work.
2970360	2972360	This thought group though, whether they, oh God.
2973360	2975360	No, no, no, take a look at the news.
2978360	2979360	They struck again.
2982360	2983360	That's horrible.
2984360	2985360	Two dead after second explosion.
2986360	2987360	Two dead, similar approach.
2988360	2989360	Same letter found.
2990360	2991360	So these are, letter?
2992360	2993360	I don't remember reading a letter.
2994360	2995360	And if that wasn't enough already,
2996360	2997360	Miss Wargate was in custody.
2998360	2999360	So that's her at the picture,
3000360	3001360	this complicates matters massively.
3002360	3003360	So much for our simple test case.
3004360	3006360	I need to speak to my superiors,
3007360	3009360	see how they are to proceed
3010360	3011360	given these extenuating circumstances.
3012360	3013360	You did good today.
3014360	3015360	You can log off and get some rest by clicking the button
3016360	3017360	on the top right of the desk.
3018360	3019360	Try and get some sleep.
3020360	3021360	I'm trying.
3022360	3023360	I have a feeling the next few days are going to be bad.
3024360	3025360	Let's see what this is though.
3026360	3027360	Explosion self at a university in Bondton,
3027360	3029360	at least two passed away, three injured.
3030360	3031360	Once again, a letter has been received
3032360	3033360	just before the crime.
3035360	3036360	Second bomb has hit freedom of square.
3040360	3042360	Even the game knows I need sleep through.
3043360	3044360	Are you sure you want to finish the work for today?
3045360	3046360	Oh, I'm pressed.
3047360	3048360	Oh.
3049360	3050360	What's been undone?
3054360	3055360	There was like one in here.
3055360	3056360	What?
3057360	3058360	A colorful...
3060360	3061360	No.
3062360	3063360	That's not going to disable it.
3064360	3065360	Okay.
3066360	3067360	Okay, so that's everything.
3068360	3069360	There was like one thing I omitted.
3070360	3071360	She celebrates people's death.
3072360	3073360	So yeah, I've done that a lot.
3074360	3075360	Even for me.
3076360	3077360	I have to be back there.
3078360	3079360	Bye bye.
3080360	3081360	That was the tutorial section done.
3082360	3083360	We've already done one out of five.
3083360	3084360	Okay.
3085360	3086360	Oh, I haven't got an achievement.
3086360	3087360	Complete episode one.
3090360	3091360	That's a lot.
3093360	3094360	I just want to say thank you to everyone
3094360	3096360	who's clipping the girls at any point.
3097360	3099360	It really helps them find clips faster
3099360	3101360	so we can shove them to the editing team.
3102360	3103360	That was the tutorial.
3103360	3104360	Yes.
3104360	3106360	I'm like 99% sure that was the tutorial.
3106360	3108360	I played this game out quite a few years back now.
3109360	3110360	I don't remember it that well.
3111360	3113360	She's been criminally charged in the past
3114360	3115360	with injuring an officer.
3115360	3116360	She's an artist.
3117360	3118360	Former criminal case.
3119360	3120360	But got dropped.
3121360	3122360	A second assault.
3122360	3123360	Activist group thought.
3124360	3126360	So we're going to have to look into that.
3127360	3128360	Okay, bedtime.
3128360	3129360	Good night guys.
3129360	3130360	See you tomorrow.
3131360	3132360	I'm so sleepy.
3133360	3134360	I just want to sleep on your chest.
3135360	3137360	I want to be like a cat and need into your chest.
3137360	3138360	Like me.
3140360	3141360	Okay, welcome back.
3141360	3143360	Hope you don't mind if we get started right away.
3143360	3145360	We have tons of work ahead of us.
3145360	3147360	I met with my superiors and they wished
3147360	3149360	to continue with the test case.
3149360	3151360	They believe in the capability of Orwell
3151360	3152360	to handle this.
3152360	3153360	Oh, Andrew of course.
3153360	3155360	Yes, me who's behind Orwell.
3155360	3156360	Okay, let's go to bed.
3156360	3157360	Yeah.
3158360	3159360	Gentle.
3160360	3161360	Okay, my superiors agreement.
3161360	3163360	Based on the information you have already extracted
3163360	3165360	the activist group known as Thought
3165360	3167360	is worth investigating.
3167360	3169360	It seems that this goldfills
3169360	3171360	is an important member of Thought.
3171360	3173360	So we now have clearance
3173360	3175360	to consider them a target person.
3175360	3177360	Are you going to part two?
3177360	3178360	Heck yeah.
3178360	3180360	I'm one like a mmm.
3180360	3181360	When it's good.
3183360	3185360	Sleep on our laps if you need rest, honestly.
3185360	3188360	I got a really cute fanart yesterday on Twitter.
3188360	3190360	I replied to it if you didn't see it.
3190360	3192360	And it was like all these reeflings in bed with me.
3192360	3194360	One of them was a furry.
3194360	3196360	They had an echo ears.
3197360	3199360	One looked like it had a wee mustache
3199360	3201360	when it was climbing on the bed.
3201360	3202360	Another reefling.
3202360	3205360	I think it was massage on my shoulders.
3207360	3209360	And like there's like three reeflings
3209360	3210360	bunched up on the other side of me.
3210360	3211360	It was really cute.
3211360	3212360	I liked it.
3212360	3213360	There's Kawainee.
3214360	3216360	I only remember like episode four.
3216360	3217360	It was probably my favorite.
3219360	3221360	Okay, now that goldfills is a target person
3221360	3223360	there may be a new data chunk
3223360	3225360	available in documents you have already
3225360	3226360	accessed.
3226360	3228360	Don't forget to go back and recheck your sources.
3228360	3229360	Okay.
3230360	3232360	Whoa, we are getting
3233360	3234360	a lot of...
3234360	3236360	Okay, so that's parents.
3236360	3237360	Yosef.
3237360	3238360	Yulia.
3238360	3239360	Yeah.
3240360	3243360	Okay, we've got a little bit of an up the entry one.
3243360	3245360	Our thoughts still free.
3245360	3246360	Okay, we've got a pic.
3246360	3247360	Nope.
3247360	3249360	Let's push up on you.
3249360	3251360	Let's add your picture, bruv.
3252360	3254360	Just needed one reading.
3254360	3256360	You go the F to sleep.
3256360	3257360	I might make that.
3257360	3259360	I think it's quite humorous.
3259360	3262360	Okay, I propose to consider the question
3262360	3264360	are our thoughts still free?
3264360	3267360	Well, this might seem to be a surprising question.
3267360	3270360	In our current world of ever growing digital surveillance
3270360	3273360	freedom of thought is no longer self-evident.
3273360	3276360	Dear reader, there is a German folk song
3276360	3278360	called the thoughts are free.
3279360	3281360	It goes like this.
3281360	3282360	Thoughts are free.
3282360	3283360	Who can guess them?
3283360	3286360	They fly like the nocturnal shadows.
3286360	3288360	No man can know them.
3288360	3291360	No hunter can shoot them with the powder and lead.
3291360	3292360	Thoughts are free.
3292360	3293360	I am not reading this properly.
3293360	3296360	I think what I want and what delights me
3296360	3297360	still always...
3297360	3299360	Ah, I don't know these words.
3299360	3301360	Okay, when I was a young lad,
3301360	3306360	long before I immigrated to the nation in 1993
3306360	3308360	memes are free, exactly.
3308360	3309360	That's the best.
3309360	3311360	I cannot read chunks like this.
3311360	3312360	It's going to mess with me.
3312360	3313360	An immigrant.
3313360	3316360	Oh no, the racism starts quick.
3316360	3319360	This is why I created this blog.
3319360	3322360	Okay, so he's a creator of thoughts,
3322360	3323360	which is fine.
3323360	3326360	Get to know the thoughts in activist group
3326360	3328360	with the same name as this blog.
3328360	3332360	If God fails as the one who created the blog,
3332360	3335360	perhaps he founded or even the leader of the activist group.
3336360	3337360	Hiya.
3337360	3340360	Oh, they're just talking.
3340360	3345360	Okay, that's the same comments as before though.
3345360	3348360	Mentions focused on thoughts are free.
3348360	3352360	I mean, this is such a small nuance.
3352360	3353360	Okay, headlines.
3353360	3354360	What's today?
3354360	3358360	Connection between the bomba to the gallows.
3358360	3361360	Write that down, write that down.
3361360	3364360	Random German in the chat that I can't translate.
3364360	3366360	Heavy rainstorms expected.
3366360	3368360	That's very important.
3368360	3369360	Yes, yes.
3369360	3372360	Timeline and Rossin announced cooperation.
3372360	3373360	Who are they?
3373360	3377360	The Davenport siblings, owners of the biggest social network.
3377360	3379360	Oh no.
3379360	3382360	Everyone's surveilled and said 10 times harder.
3382360	3385360	Let's see what the bomba is going on.
3385360	3387360	Any highlighting notes?
3387360	3388360	No.
3388360	3390360	What about this?
3390360	3392360	That is all your personal data.
3392360	3395360	Just get on like that.
3395360	3398360	We are literally singing the song you saw a minute ago.
3398360	3399360	Oh, where he is?
3399360	3400360	I'm so sorry.
3400360	3402360	I don't recognize that.
3402360	3403360	Cassandra update.
3403360	3405360	What's going on with you?
3405360	3410360	Oh, she is redacted.
3410360	3413360	She's in trouble.
3413360	3418360	Okay, there's something here on the website.
3418360	3423360	I think.
3423360	3427360	Is there something on the website?
3427360	3433360	I have a little red mark.
3433360	3434360	Do I really need to...
3434360	3435360	Okay, fine.
3435360	3438360	Our report thoughts are free.
3438360	3439360	Okay, right.
3439360	3441360	Just if it's harmless, report it.
3441360	3442360	The letter.
3442360	3443360	We are right, it seems.
3443360	3446360	That's what the letter says.
3446360	3450360	The thoughts are free?
3450360	3451360	That's terrible.
3451360	3454360	If that's true.
3454360	3457360	Who's listening?
3457360	3459360	Hey, you.
3459360	3463360	Hi.
3463360	3464360	I'm sorry about last night.
3464360	3465360	I really should have come over.
3465360	3466360	Well, you didn't.
3466360	3469360	So what are you going to say to that?
3469360	3470360	What's the calling card?
3470360	3472360	Where did we get it?
3472360	3473360	Wait a minute.
3473360	3474360	The government doesn't want you to know this,
3474360	3475360	but thoughts are free.
3475360	3477360	You can just take them.
3477360	3480360	Yank.
3480360	3483360	It's just that this client is massively influential
3483360	3485360	and could have break a whole lot of exposure.
3485360	3487360	I've been trying to get a meeting for months
3487360	3488360	and it went rather well.
3488360	3489360	So here's hoping.
3489360	3490360	God, I'm such a stupid old man
3490360	3492360	who just talks about his job too much.
3492360	3493360	I'm sorry.
3493360	3494360	It's just a big part of my life.
3494360	3495360	Hello?
3495360	3496360	Are you still upset?
3496360	3498360	Oh, he doesn't know that she's in jail.
3498360	3500360	She's got the jail.
3500360	3501360	Can you answer me if you don't?
3501360	3502360	I'll start to worry.
3502360	3503360	You know what I'm like?
3503360	3504360	She's in jail.
3504360	3505360	She's in jail.
3505360	3506360	You just don't know.
3506360	3507360	Okay.
3507360	3511360	I thirdly believed we are able to capture minds
3511360	3514360	if only we could garner attention to the group.
3514360	3517360	After one and a half years recruiting two of my students
3517360	3520360	and arranging three demonstrations.
3520360	3526360	So he's the one that's kind of mastermind in it a bit.
3526360	3528360	Three demonstrations.
3528360	3530360	More interesting might be the two students
3530360	3531360	that were involved.
3531360	3532360	Okay.
3532360	3536360	Frankly and sadly, the answer to the latter is a resounding no,
3536360	3540360	which was the question was are we true to the initial goal?
3540360	3543360	We let ourselves be consumed by anger and hatred
3543360	3546360	towards those who did wrong.
3546360	3549360	Reacts with hatred and anger about troubled past of thought,
3549360	3551360	hinted at troubled past.
3551360	3554360	Thoughts are free, but that does not mean that we can attack
3554360	3557360	or do whatever they wish instead of blaming others.
3557360	3561360	I see now my high aims might well be the cause
3561360	3564360	for all of the events of the past months.
3564360	3567360	More than anyone else have thought, I feel responsible.
3567360	3569360	Hmm.
3569360	3571360	Feels responsible.
3571360	3574360	Reacts with hatred and anger.
3576360	3579360	I think feels responsible.
3579360	3582360	Because look, as a consequence, I'll halt my activities.
3582360	3584360	So he feels responsible.
3584360	3585360	Okay.
3586360	3588360	I will halt my activities.
3588360	3590360	Oops, sorry.
3590360	3593360	A troubled past, we will have to get to the bottom of this.
3593360	3596360	But he's going to stop his activities.
3596360	3600360	Oh man, my duck army crew is a violent group.
3600360	3602360	Write that down.
3602360	3606360	Whatever active engagement means still an interesting fact.
3606360	3609360	He is a lecturer at a university.
3609360	3610360	Yes.
3610360	3612360	Oh, and we've got a really good thing.
3612360	3614360	What now?
3615360	3616360	What now?
3616360	3617360	Still again?
3617360	3620360	The same still again where the bomb popped its clogs?
3620360	3624360	You know what I think about coincidence is I ain't going to repeat it.
3624360	3628360	So far the evidence suggests that Goldfels was a prominent lecturer
3628360	3631360	and some of his students became involved in thought.
3631360	3633360	Did he like recruit them for the cause?
3633360	3635360	We need to identify those students.
3635360	3637360	See who else is involved in that group.
3637360	3639360	Concerned number one.
3639360	3640360	Please reconsider.
3640360	3644360	Guy, her, there was only a call.
3644360	3645360	They had it coming.
3645360	3647360	It was messy, I know.
3647360	3649360	You made the news.
3649360	3653360	Beryl, thank you for becoming a member for a month.
3653360	3655360	A little celebration anniversary.
3655360	3657360	It works on you.
3659360	3661360	You didn't put a wee thing.
3661360	3662360	You could have put a message.
3662360	3663360	I can read it.
3663360	3666360	You forgot to put a message.
3666360	3667360	It's okay.
3667360	3668360	Okay.
3668360	3670360	I'll just make up a message.
3670360	3671360	Strongly love.
3671360	3673360	Briefing love.
3673360	3675360	Okay, I made it for you.
3675360	3676360	Continue to main page.
3676360	3678360	What's going on here?
3678360	3686360	Yesterday there was a microwave incident with popcorn in a blue.
3686360	3689360	It wrapped itself up in tin foil and blew itself up.
3689360	3692360	Are you squidding me right now?
3692360	3694360	Nugget.
3694360	3697360	Nugget said a message.
3697360	3700360	Thank you for becoming a member for a month.
3700360	3701360	How do you say it?
3701360	3705360	Did I be like, oh, thank you for the repeated membership?
3705360	3707360	Or continued membership?
3707360	3708360	Yeah.
3708360	3710360	Thank you for the continued membership.
3710360	3712360	Why, yes, of course.
3712360	3715360	Are you squidding me right now?
3715360	3718360	It's already been a month.
3718360	3719360	That's pretty crazy.
3719360	3721360	Honestly, all things considered.
3721360	3723360	How did we get here?
3723360	3725360	Oh, my God.
3725360	3728360	Oh, my God.
3728360	3729360	Thanks for the sub.
3729360	3731360	Thanks for the second month.
3731360	3733360	Oh, yeah, it's technically the thing.
3733360	3735360	It's technically the second.
3735360	3738360	No, one full month because it starts on zero.
3738360	3740360	So this is the first full month.
3740360	3741360	Thank you.
3741360	3742360	Yeah.
3742360	3744360	Oh, you've all got blue seashells now.
3744360	3749360	Sally sells seashells by the seashore.
3749360	3752360	He's retired.
3752360	3754360	Oops.
3754360	3755360	Who's this?
3755360	3758360	Oh, it's him.
3758360	3761360	Got another picture of him.
3761360	3763360	We are in the second month.
3763360	3765360	Blue seashell team.
3765360	3768360	Being a luminary in his profession.
3768360	3771360	Oh, Abraham is his name.
3771360	3773360	Gladly accepted that.
3773360	3776360	Oh, Abraham is well done.
3776360	3781360	Professor in the field of media ethics.
3781360	3783360	He had sadly retired.
3783360	3785360	I've got to wait two more days.
3785360	3788360	Can you last two more days?
3788360	3791360	Yeah, I think you can.
3791360	3795360	Be good and wait.
3795360	3799360	Did you notice the bomber seems to be closely connected to thought?
3799360	3802360	There could be pattern.
3802360	3805360	Thought had held three demonstrations.
3805360	3807360	Actually, what I've got a bone effect.
3807360	3809360	Hold on.
3809360	3817360	I've got a bone effect with a certain marshmallow.
3817360	3820360	I have a bone effect with a certain marshmallow.
3820360	3821360	I'm going to read it out.
3821360	3822360	It was so bad.
3822360	3823360	I'm reading it out.
3823360	3825360	And you know exactly who you are.
3825360	3827360	Who fucking sent this.
3827360	3828360	Hold on.
3828360	3829360	Let me find it.
3829360	3836360	Let me find it.
3836360	3838360	Where is it?
3838360	3839360	Where is it?
3839360	3842360	It was a recent one.
3842360	3843360	That's right.
3843360	3845360	You're in trouble, Riflin.
3845360	3846360	You're in trouble.
3846360	3850360	And you know exactly who you are.
3850360	3852360	I'm going to read this.
3852360	3855360	Because Riflin, you had nothing but the audacity.
3855360	3857360	Imagine I'm railing you in your bedroom
3857360	3860360	and your dad comes home early and sees me pounding you
3860360	3862360	and slapping your cheeks while you scream harder.
3862360	3864360	With that end, okay?
3864360	3867360	What if he sees the creation of her child, his grandchild?
3867360	3868360	How embarrassing.
3868360	3870360	I'd be so ashamed, Lamal.
3870360	3873360	Riflin, who the fuck sent that?
3873360	3877360	Who sent that with their whole chest?
3877360	3884360	Who formulated those letters?
3884360	3887360	Which one of you did that?
3887360	3891360	I know you're cackling behind the keyboard right now.
3891360	3898360	If I ever, if I ever spot you at a convention,
3898360	3908360	if I ever, your left ball is getting upped.
3908360	3911360	I don't remember sending that now.
3911360	3914360	Absolutely not.
3914360	3915360	Right.
3915360	3917360	Thought has held three demonstrations,
3917360	3919360	yet there has only been two bomba,
3919360	3922360	which might imply, well, it's definitely shot in the dark,
3922360	3924360	but we absolutely need to do everything we can
3924360	3925360	to prevent another attack.
3925360	3928360	Take a close look at the path of each member with thought.
3928360	3931360	Find out the locations of all demonstrations
3931360	3933360	that have held that might yield a hint.
3933360	3936360	Why only the left one?
3936360	3937360	Because I need to pick on one.
3937360	3938360	It was either left or right.
3938360	3940360	I'll pick on your left ball instead.
3940360	3941360	She pops your left ball.
3941360	3942360	You'll never have a daughter.
3942360	3943360	That's how it works, right?
3943360	3944360	No!
3944360	3946360	Thought it all works at all.
3946360	3947360	That's funny.
3947360	3948360	Okay.
3948360	3951360	Journalist at Der Reporter.
3951360	3952360	One of the most...
3952360	3953360	Oh, it's German.
3953360	3954360	Sorry.
3954360	3955360	Like Der.
3955360	3959360	You lose one chromosome that you can pass over.
3959360	3960360	Okay.
3960360	3961360	Formula G.
3961360	3963360	And was also chairman of Global Media...
3963360	3967360	Man, this guy has quite the portfolio on him.
3967360	3968360	Jeez.
3968360	3970360	Chairman of an ethical congress,
3970360	3973360	just to average one of the mill.
3973360	3975360	Steady on sims.
3975360	3978360	I think you've been a bit radicalized yourself, mate.
3978360	3981360	Wow, that's a whole lot of information about this fella.
3981360	3985360	Yet, only one other page could be indexed.
3985360	3987360	Very strange indeed.
3987360	3992360	I think the next course of action should be to look for other people of this group,
3992360	3995360	like the students he mentioned.
3995360	3996360	Thoughts are free.
3996360	3997360	Oh, okay.
3997360	3999360	This is another link.
3999360	4003360	A modern time declaration of independence towards mass surveillance.
4003360	4004360	Cure it.
4004360	4007360	Your genes become joints.
4007360	4009360	Well, what do you say to that?
4009360	4011360	He literally wrote the book.
4011360	4012360	Well, yeah.
4012360	4014360	Okay, what's the headline?
4014360	4015360	Breaking news.
4015360	4017360	First suspect in connection.
4017360	4018360	Who?
4018360	4020360	Women arrested in connection.
4020360	4023360	Oh, okay.
4023360	4026360	They've broken the news, right?
4026360	4027360	What's going on?
4027360	4030360	Whoa, there's like a lot of new information on this page.
4030360	4031360	Home.
4031360	4033360	What's new on it?
4034360	4039360	Wait, did I not just...
4039360	4040360	There's nothing new on this.
4040360	4043360	I'm being trolled.
4043360	4046360	Oh, these are students.
4046360	4049360	Did I need to interact with them?
4049360	4051360	Because I said I needed to get students.
4051360	4054360	I bet he stopped leading the group and one of his radicals took over.
4054360	4058360	I am leaving that too.
4058360	4060360	Why can I not interact with them?
4060360	4062360	Maybe I interact with the later stage.
4062360	4063360	Attendee list.
4063360	4064360	Okay.
4064360	4066360	I don't know where you found that.
4066360	4068360	Summer?
4074360	4076360	Wait, where's his class?
4080360	4083360	I'm freaking to say I'm actually going to have to use my head.
4083360	4084360	Hold on.
4084360	4085360	Hold on.
4085360	4086360	Right.
4086360	4088360	What was his class again?
4088360	4090360	Media Ethics.
4092360	4093360	Okay.
4093360	4095360	Okay, take me to the list.
4095360	4097360	Winter.
4097360	4099360	Media.
4099360	4100360	And then what's his name again?
4100360	4102360	Big...
4102360	4104360	Big Gold Felt.
4104360	4105360	I would be terrible at this job.
4105360	4106360	I already forget the names.
4106360	4107360	Right.
4107360	4110360	I think you're already retired at this point, so you don't count.
4110360	4111360	Okay.
4111360	4112360	So then go Previous.
4112360	4114360	Then go Summer.
4114360	4116360	Then go Media.
4116360	4118360	And then look for Gold Fells.
4118360	4119360	Gold Fells.
4119360	4121360	Abraham.
4123360	4125360	Nothing's been highlighted.
4125360	4126360	Oh.
4127360	4129360	Juliet.
4129360	4131360	Ooh.
4131360	4133360	Juliet.
4133360	4135360	We're seeing that name before, haven't we?
4135360	4136360	Right.
4136360	4137360	She was a friend of Miss Wargate.
4137360	4139360	Now it appears that she's a student.
4139360	4140360	I think that's enough to warrant a report.
4140360	4142360	Give me a few minutes.
4142360	4145360	Alright, we have authorization to investigate her.
4146360	4147360	Oh.
4147360	4148360	Okay, we have a profile now.
4148360	4150360	O'Donnell Harrison.
4152360	4154360	What's that then, too?
4155360	4158360	Joseph Lang is Cassandra's boyfriend and on the
4158360	4160360	Illumini list.
4160360	4162360	Ooh, I didn't spot that.
4162360	4163360	Harrison O'Donnell.
4163360	4165360	Yes, we have seen that name as well.
4165360	4166360	I'll report this right away.
4166360	4168360	Yes, yes.
4168360	4170360	We have been authorized to consider Harrison.
4170360	4173360	Oh, that was the gorilla guy.
4173360	4176360	Now there's some more work for you.
4176360	4177360	Congrats.
4177360	4178360	Okay.
4178360	4181360	Harrison and Juliet, they must be students within
4181360	4182360	Thought.
4182360	4183360	Well done.
4183360	4184360	Okay.
4184360	4185360	Anyone else?
4185360	4187360	Nicholas Webb.
4187360	4188360	Wheeler.
4188360	4190360	William.
4190360	4191360	Right.
4191360	4193360	Oh, we've got their timelines.
4193360	4194360	Okay.
4194360	4196360	First profile picture.
4197360	4199360	Next.
4199360	4201360	Your job, which is a PR assistant at
4201360	4203360	Rosen Tech.
4203360	4205360	Your birthday is February,
4205360	4207360	1992.
4207360	4209360	God, we even have your location.
4209360	4211360	This is too easy, bro.
4211360	4212360	Okay.
4212360	4213360	Fair view.
4213360	4214360	We even got location.
4214360	4216360	Interest, guitar singing, board games.
4216360	4218360	It's not really necessary.
4218360	4221360	I mean, I guess I'll just take it because it's a
4221360	4222360	wee thing.
4222360	4225360	It's not really that interesting.
4227360	4230360	Ha, you can dance and I got the proof now.
4230360	4232360	Oh, is that really me?
4232360	4234360	I'm going to be careful around you apparently.
4234360	4235360	Great photo though.
4235360	4236360	You took it.
4236360	4237360	Nice try, Jules.
4237360	4239360	A magician never reveals her trick.
4242360	4244360	Anyway, thanks for a great time.
4244360	4247360	I must admit, it felt kind of good to go out for once.
4247360	4250360	Not that I plan on doing it again any time soon.
4250360	4253360	Well, every time I ask you out, you still go out that busy
4253360	4256360	and then you fall for freaking muffins.
4256360	4259360	Wait, did he just call the blue here when a muffin?
4261360	4262360	Sorry, Adam.
4262360	4264360	Maybe you need to spy on me somewhere.
4265360	4266360	Oh, okay.
4266360	4267360	That was rather random.
4267360	4269360	I've got to go walk the dog.
4269360	4270360	Okay.
4270360	4271360	Where's my collar?
4271360	4272360	Put on me.
4274360	4276360	Sorry, that was really cringe.
4276360	4277360	Even I made myself grimace there.
4277360	4279360	I was like, ooh, steady on.
4279360	4280360	I'm bored to death.
4280360	4282360	I'm making cupcakes.
4282360	4284360	That girl next door.
4285360	4287360	You know, I'm not so keen on going out late.
4287360	4289360	Plus, I don't dance.
4289360	4290360	Okay, no.
4291360	4292360	All right, all right.
4292360	4294360	You're going to be there tortured by my girlfriend.
4294360	4295360	No.
4295360	4297360	Oh, friend, engaged in torture.
4297360	4298360	No.
4298360	4299360	No.
4299360	4300360	Don't be silly.
4300360	4302360	The pet play allegations.
4302360	4303360	Wait.
4303360	4305360	Someone said all of us are in on that.
4305360	4307360	And I'm like, is Azura in on that?
4307360	4310360	I didn't think Azura had anything to do with pet play.
4313360	4316360	Ooh, I actually needed to ask you.
4316360	4319360	I was going to order a collar and a bowl,
4319360	4321360	but I don't know if I put wreathling on it,
4321360	4323360	like your name on it.
4324360	4326360	I put wreathling on that and then it's like
4326360	4328360	I'm property of wreathling.
4328360	4331360	Or do I need to put my name on it?
4331360	4333360	I don't know how it works.
4335360	4337360	Put wreathling on the bowl.
4337360	4338360	Okay.
4339360	4341360	Okay, so I put your name on it
4341360	4343360	because you own me.
4343360	4345360	Okay, got it, got it, got it, got it.
4345360	4346360	Happy birthday, honey.
4346360	4348360	So glad to have you back.
4348360	4351360	We are the Kerrytons.
4351360	4353360	Welcome to our website.
4353360	4356360	Ooh, look at all these people.
4356360	4358360	Oh, she's having a good time.
4359360	4360360	Sushi.
4360360	4361360	Oh, I'm hungry now.
4361360	4362360	Whoa.
4363360	4366360	Whoa, she got more of her thing there.
4366360	4368360	Yeah, because you're not dumb enough to do the opposite.
4368360	4370360	Azura would be the owner in anything.
4370360	4372360	Put ink jar on it.
4372360	4374360	Okay, I'll order my little doggy bowl
4374360	4376360	and my collar.
4376360	4378360	Her favorite color is red.
4378360	4380360	She likes playing a guitar
4380360	4381360	to kill a mockingbird.
4381360	4383360	I've still not read the other one yet.
4383360	4385360	Since the nestling of the family
4385360	4386360	showed up a little bit, the parents,
4386360	4387360	John and...
4387360	4390360	Okay, so we have father and mother.
4390360	4392360	Decided that they would end
4392360	4395360	the strictness of naming pattern her sister.
4395360	4396360	Juliet played guitar.
4396360	4397360	Yeah, we get it.
4397360	4400360	She decided to enter band career
4400360	4403360	once she was single again.
4404360	4405360	There's a conf...
4405360	4407360	And focus on her university studies.
4407360	4409360	So we have undeniable proof
4409360	4412360	that she was in the class of that guy.
4413360	4415360	We just need to find this conflicting date.
4415360	4417360	And we'll find this part of it.
4419360	4421360	I feel like you don't want us wearing tinfoil
4421360	4423360	considering your plot.
4424360	4425360	Red might be important
4425360	4428360	if the letter is written in a certain color.
4431360	4432360	What's she doing?
4432360	4434360	Nobody...
4434360	4435360	Nobody took notice.
4435360	4437360	Nobody cares, nobody.
4437360	4439360	What did Harry do this time?
4440360	4442360	Ooh, she's dating Harry.
4442360	4443360	Even though Cassandra and I
4443360	4445360	just got to know each other as a protest,
4445360	4446360	she stood up for me.
4446360	4448360	Okay, so we have...
4448360	4451360	We have proof that they also met as well.
4452360	4455360	This woman is a hero and not a terrorist.
4456360	4458360	Rick Denton?
4459360	4461360	How come you care so much about politics now?
4463360	4465360	This doesn't sound like the Juliet.
4465360	4466360	I know.
4466360	4467360	You wouldn't even accept
4467360	4469360	the Juliet being class representative.
4469360	4471360	How come you care so much about politics?
4472360	4473360	And go for it.
4473360	4475360	Sometimes people change their minds.
4478360	4480360	First Miss Watergate and now hers.
4480360	4482360	There's some sort of brainwashing going on.
4483360	4484360	I understand.
4484360	4485360	Strongly.
4485360	4486360	The high table.
4489360	4491360	That's not funny.
4492360	4494360	Ooh, this guy's a bit more smart
4494360	4496360	with his information.
4498360	4499360	Harrison, we've got a picture of him.
4499360	4501360	He says Media Punk, though.
4502360	4503360	Sure.
4503360	4505360	We'll put that as your occupation
4505360	4506360	for now.
4506360	4507360	Media Punk.
4508360	4509360	Media Punk.
4509360	4510360	What does that even mean?
4510360	4511360	This is being deleted.
4511360	4513360	Deleted multiple posts.
4513360	4514360	Ooh.
4516360	4517360	Ooh.
4518360	4519360	Do we have something to hide,
4519360	4520360	Mr. O'Donnell?
4522360	4523360	Always hiding everything.
4523360	4524360	Ooh.
4525360	4527360	You got this couple rock the show
4527360	4529360	as it will rock the rest
4529360	4531360	of the goddamn nation.
4531360	4533360	Well, you've posted proof
4533360	4535360	that you were with the other girl.
4535360	4537360	Juliet is a, yeah.
4537360	4539360	Our two student members of Thought
4539360	4541360	are a couple, interesting.
4543360	4545360	Mike, why didn't you go and ask Juliet
4545360	4546360	out right away, huh?
4546360	4547360	No need for hiding anything.
4547360	4548360	No need for hiding anything.
4548360	4550360	I can provide a nose correction
4550360	4553360	just for you to make you look like a...
4553360	4554360	Just...
4554360	4555360	You want that?
4555360	4556360	No, then Ethel.
4557360	4558360	If you got it flunked,
4558360	4560360	oh, so he gave a compliment
4560360	4561360	and he's coming in region.
4561360	4562360	Easily jealous.
4562360	4564360	I mean, that's not really
4564360	4566360	gonna help find the bomba.
4568360	4570360	There we have the connection.
4570360	4571360	Connection.
4571360	4572360	Yeah.
4573360	4574360	Okay, I don't really think it's
4574360	4575360	necessary to put in, like,
4575360	4578360	the smaller details like that.
4578360	4579360	Harrison likes to target
4579360	4581360	the haunted house with the cash
4581360	4583360	instead of the clash.
4583360	4585360	The national beholder.
4585360	4588360	We hold the ThunderDome.
4588360	4589360	Okay, welcome.
4590360	4592360	Rosin Technologies.
4592360	4593360	What are you?
4595360	4597360	A Rosin is the family.
4597360	4598360	Oh, we've got a listen.
4598360	4599360	Sorry, we've got a listen.
4599360	4600360	Sorry.
4601360	4603360	Oh, she got access to her phone.
4606360	4608360	What happened yesterday?
4609360	4611360	You got yoinked.
4612360	4614360	Juliet, this is
4614360	4616360	Yosef on Cassandra's account.
4616360	4618360	Oh, my God, what?
4621360	4622360	Wait,
4622360	4624360	did I have a profile on Yosef?
4624360	4625360	I must have.
4628360	4630360	This is the correct account.
4630360	4635360	It's disabled.
4637360	4638360	Oh, right.
4638360	4639360	I can only do it on her.
4639360	4640360	Sorry, I didn't.
4640360	4641360	I didn't drop it.
4642360	4644360	Not too uncommon in a relationship.
4644360	4645360	Oh, sorry.
4645360	4646360	Hi.
4646360	4647360	Didn't know you had access to her.
4647360	4649360	Nice to talk to you too, Juliet.
4649360	4650360	Have you seen Cassandra since yesterday?
4650360	4651360	Heard from her.
4651360	4652360	I spoke to her last night via chat.
4652360	4653360	She seemed quite upset
4653360	4654360	about the whole plaza thing.
4654360	4656360	And something else
4656360	4657360	she wouldn't talk about,
4657360	4659360	then there was something at her door.
4659360	4660360	Someone at her door.
4660360	4661360	So she went to answer it
4661360	4662360	and never came back.
4662360	4663360	I assumed it was you.
4663360	4664360	We were supposed to meet for dinner
4664360	4665360	but I had an unexpected meeting.
4665360	4667360	She wasn't exactly happy
4667360	4668360	about the change of plans.
4668360	4670360	She quit the chat.
4670360	4671360	And that was it.
4671360	4672360	I haven't heard from her since.
4672360	4673360	In that case,
4673360	4674360	I think she's probably home
4674360	4675360	stewing away.
4675360	4676360	Well, I just tried that.
4676360	4677360	She gave me the keyster a flat
4677360	4678360	two months ago,
4678360	4679360	but no Cassie,
4679360	4680360	also her PC was still on.
4680360	4681360	Hmm, I guess.
4681360	4682360	Calling her didn't work.
4682360	4683360	No, I tried.
4683360	4684360	Damn, I hate myself right now.
4684360	4685360	Did you set your number to private?
4685360	4686360	Otherwise, she's probably
4686360	4687360	just avoiding you.
4687360	4688360	Private is my default
4688360	4690360	after all I am a lawyer.
4690360	4692360	No, Cassandra's not a lawyer.
4692360	4693360	Oh, the fuck,
4693360	4694360	ignore that.
4694360	4696360	Cassandra's not a lawyer.
4698360	4700360	Must be meticulous as possible.
4700360	4703360	We will get to the bottom of this.
4703360	4705360	When she's mad,
4705360	4706360	she usually goes to wonders
4706360	4707360	around the city.
4707360	4708360	She'll be back in no time.
4708360	4709360	Yeah, she does get
4709360	4711360	about fiery at times.
4711360	4712360	Fireball.
4712360	4713360	That doesn't really work
4713360	4714360	like wild card.
4714360	4715360	There's the refland
4715360	4717360	that's been put in wild card.
4717360	4719360	In my marshmallow.
4719360	4720360	And I'm like,
4720360	4721360	okay, that's actually,
4721360	4722360	wait a minute,
4722360	4723360	do you think this guy's
4723360	4726360	one on her account?
4726360	4728360	The lawyer's on her account.
4728360	4729360	Are you trolling me?
4729360	4731360	Are you messing me up on purpose?
4731360	4733360	Oh, I doubt that somehow.
4733360	4734360	Oh, sorry.
4734360	4735360	See, this is why I want to,
4735360	4736360	I feel like you know
4736360	4737360	are better than I do.
4737360	4739360	And I'm the boyfriend.
4739360	4740360	Oh, I doubt that.
4740360	4741360	I mean, you two were
4741360	4743360	at the plaza together.
4743360	4744360	And so I thought maybe
4744360	4746360	you'd know other places
4746360	4749360	that could be important to her.
4749360	4750360	I'm sorry, freedom plaza
4750360	4752360	was organized by thought.
4752360	4753360	Yeah, but Harrison
4753360	4755360	did all the planning.
4755360	4757360	What's the conflict?
4757360	4758360	I must know.
4758360	4759360	You must let me know
4759360	4763360	the conflict.
4763360	4766360	I must find the conflict.
4766360	4768360	Harrison did the planning,
4768360	4770360	apparently,
4770360	4772360	as our little gorilla's
4772360	4775360	listener wild card is.
4775360	4776360	Thank you.
4776360	4777360	Anyway, session closed.
4777360	4778360	Right.
4778360	4782360	So we need to find the conflict.
4782360	4787360	The Ten Commandments.
4787360	4788360	Okay.
4788360	4789360	I was like,
4789360	4794360	Serion, what's going on here?
4794360	4797360	Oh, we've got a phone number.
4797360	4802360	Oh, Julie.
4802360	4804360	Gate card.
4804360	4806360	Well, good work.
4806360	4807360	The listener will also track
4807360	4809360	incoming, outgoing telephone
4809360	4812360	calls of numbers you've added.
4812360	4814360	It's not really that farfetched,
4814360	4817360	is it?
4817360	4820360	Oh.
4820360	4823360	Did we get to hear voices?
4823360	4824360	Oh, no.
4824360	4826360	Welcome to Brusenthek.
4826360	4829360	This is the PR assistant, Juliet.
4829360	4831360	How can I be a servant?
4831360	4833360	Hello, this is Esther.
4833360	4834360	You sound so official at work.
4834360	4835360	Oh, hi, Mom.
4835360	4836360	What's up?
4836360	4838360	How's that going in?
4838360	4840360	The Harrison character's looking
4840360	4841360	sus as anything.
4841360	4843360	I have to agree.
4843360	4845360	I am going home for it lives
4845360	4846360	with her parents.
4846360	4847360	Okay.
4847360	4849360	So when we take her down,
4849360	4850360	we need to remember the parents
4850360	4851360	when actually I'm heading out
4851360	4853360	with some friends.
4853360	4857360	Now let's find her parents address.
4857360	4858360	She plans on going abroad.
4858360	4860360	Sure, you can make plans
4860360	4862360	go for it.
4862360	4863360	Now I'm back.
4863360	4864360	How's the case going?
4864360	4868360	Ah, Juliet is apparently broken up
4868360	4872360	with the guy that planned it.
4872360	4874360	Honey, please, you won't have much
4874360	4876360	freedom left if you're passed away.
4876360	4878360	Mom, I won't die.
4878360	4880360	How can you be so sure of that?
4880360	4882360	I could just as easily be hit by a car
4882360	4883360	on the way home.
4883360	4885360	Don't say that.
4885360	4887360	Just think this ridiculous grip
4887360	4890360	I've gotten you into nothing but trouble.
4890360	4891360	Alright.
4891360	4892360	Sheesh.
4892360	4893360	Thank you, honey.
4893360	4895360	Mom, I'm sorry.
4895360	4896360	But I really have to go.
4896360	4899360	I don't want to be fired by my boss,
4899360	4901360	Victor Rothen.
4901360	4902360	I have to go.
4902360	4903360	I'm sorry.
4903360	4904360	Love you.
4904360	4905360	Bye-bye.
4905360	4906360	Curious, curious.
4906360	4907360	Okay.
4907360	4909360	So we have a boss, which is fine.
4909360	4912360	We're allowed to have bosses.
4912360	4914360	Huh?
4914360	4916360	Wait, what the actual...
4916360	4918360	The moment you open the dock,
4918360	4919360	well, this is...
4919360	4922360	Code Injection was detected in Orwell.
4922360	4924360	We've had 47 attack warnings
4924360	4927360	and still counting what is on that site.
4927360	4928360	Okay, okay.
4928360	4929360	Let's get off it.
4929360	4932360	So we don't get hacked.
4932360	4935360	We got malware.
4935360	4937360	Band, we are track.
4937360	4940360	We are the track you are ashamed of
4940360	4942360	in your fine-tuned playlist.
4942360	4944360	Oh, okay, that's funny.
4944360	4945360	Okay, hold on.
4945360	4947360	We're getting somewhere with this guy.
4947360	4949360	He cannot run away from us.
4949360	4954360	His name is Hancock.
4954360	4956360	The cogs are turning in my head.
4956360	4957360	If I had enough sleep,
4957360	4960360	I already would have said something wildly inappropriate.
4960360	4965360	Oh, that's quite the ego we've got there, haven't we?
4965360	4967360	Here's a wee photo of ya.
4967360	4968360	Upload.
4968360	4971360	Yeah.
4971360	4973360	That one looks more complimentary.
4973360	4975360	Warmer members.
4975360	4977360	Juliet.
4977360	4978360	Wrong profile.
4978360	4979360	But that's okay,
4979360	4981360	because we have Juliet.
4981360	4984360	Mummy downloaded the popcorn.
4984360	4985360	They got me.
4985360	4987360	See, that's what happens if you don't have a pie hole.
4987360	4989360	Wait, that's just that picture flipped.
4989360	4991360	The other way.
4991360	4992360	No.
4992360	4993360	Right, okay.
4993360	4994360	Let's do the professional one.
4994360	4995360	Nah, okay.
4995360	4996360	No.
4996360	4997360	Dude, the flipped one.
4997360	4998360	Sorry.
4998360	5000360	I know it doesn't even matter,
5000360	5001360	but I didn't find it.
5001360	5002360	Right, gigs.
5002360	5003360	Where are they playing?
5003360	5005360	I want to see them.
5005360	5010360	The target's featuring tearing down his cancel.
5010360	5012360	He decided to quit.
5012360	5014360	A friend of mine claims he heard that he quit,
5014360	5016360	but no official statements be given out.
5016360	5019360	A whole hearted thumbs down.
5019360	5022360	Oh, boo, thumbs down, boo.
5022360	5024360	Fucking thumbs down.
5024360	5026360	Okay, I'm not going to report that,
5026360	5030360	because that was a claim.
5030360	5031360	The cell.
5031360	5034360	We'll definitely come to Freedom Plot.
5034360	5035360	I just have to get to know Juliet,
5035360	5038360	especially since she's the one organizing.
5038360	5051360	Well, so Cassandra claims that Juliet did it,
5051360	5052360	but I'm going to be honest,
5052360	5054360	Juliet isn't striking me.
5054360	5056360	We'll definitely come.
5056360	5059360	I have to go because Juliet is doing a show conflict.
5059360	5069360	And so I thought maybe no other places should be important to her.
5069360	5071360	I was organized by thought,
5071360	5080360	yeah, but Harrison did all the planning.
5080360	5084360	I want to say Harrison did it.
5084360	5087360	Yeah, because she doesn't have a clue where else she might be.
5087360	5088360	I'm going to say Harrison did it.
5088360	5091360	I might regret this, but I don't know.
5091360	5092360	From the two conflicts,
5092360	5095360	it kind of seems like she's just tagging along with him.
5095360	5098360	He planned the protest that went completely awry.
5098360	5099360	He doesn't sound like,
5099360	5102360	doesn't sound like a good plan into me.
5102360	5105360	I bet you were going to say Hancock up at my house.
5105360	5108360	No, I couldn't come up with the funny enough joke.
5108360	5110360	Or maybe it didn't go awry at all.
5110360	5113360	Maybe it went down exactly as he had in mind.
5113360	5115360	We'll have done it now.
5115360	5118360	That Freedom Plaza demonstration was one of thought's protest,
5118360	5120360	not in surprise.
5120360	5123360	One down, two more locations to go.
5123360	5126360	Oh, what have we got?
5126360	5128360	No, not another phone call.
5128360	5131360	Oh, they're talking to each other.
5131360	5133360	Ring ring, hello.
5133360	5135360	You've got a Donald.
5135360	5136360	Harrison, it's me.
5136360	5139360	Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, look who it is.
5139360	5141360	I know this moment is coming to you.
5141360	5143360	But you've caught me by surprise.
5143360	5145360	I've already got a handle on it.
5145360	5146360	Shh, Juliet.
5146360	5149360	Ever since we first made out on that night,
5149360	5150360	I knew it was...
5150360	5153360	Oh, no, he's a stalker.
5158360	5160360	Will you please spare me?
5160360	5162360	I didn't believe you, but it really is you.
5162360	5164360	Uh, okay.
5164360	5165360	Steligan again.
5165360	5168360	The university needs to play a major part.
5168360	5170360	And what do I owe the beautiful pleasure of your voice?
5170360	5172360	You miss me.
5172360	5175360	So this is why you did it, to make me call you back again?
5175360	5177360	The heck are you talking about?
5177360	5179360	Oh, don't play dumb, great administrator.
5179360	5181360	I'm talking about the thought page.
5181360	5183360	You're so generously volunteered to maintain.
5183360	5185360	Wait, give me a sec.
5185360	5186360	What the...
5186360	5188360	You're messing around with me, Jules.
5188360	5192360	Are you seriously trying to say this wasn't your doing?
5192360	5195360	Rather eff would I disgrace thought.
5195360	5200360	Maybe because the same reason you bailed out of thought all of a sudden.
5201360	5204360	Wait, why would you plan it and then bail?
5204360	5206360	Thought you didn't...
5206360	5207360	Oh, so...
5207360	5208360	Oh, is that so?
5208360	5210360	We need to keep observing.
5210360	5211360	Okay, hold on.
5211360	5212360	I can't read that fast.
5212360	5214360	Thought you didn't do...
5214360	5216360	Since Abe disappeared.
5216360	5219360	Disappeared causing thought to come inactive.
5219360	5220360	Where does that...
5220360	5221360	Who does that go?
5221360	5223360	On her?
5223360	5225360	Wrong, but wait, what?
5225360	5227360	Oh, on Abraham.
5227360	5229360	Sorry, on Abraham.
5229360	5232360	Okay, so Abe disappeared.
5232360	5235360	Perfect voice acting, I'm so sorry.
5235360	5238360	Abraham Goh feels disappeared causing the group to be out.
5238360	5239360	They're no longer active?
5239360	5241360	Well, seems like someone still is.
5241360	5243360	To bail on the two of us.
5243360	5246360	Former relationship ended...
5246360	5248360	Why is that changing?
5248360	5250360	Former relationship.
5250360	5251360	Wrong profile.
5251360	5253360	Sorry.
5253360	5257360	Okay, so I'll update for both of them.
5257360	5258360	Okay.
5258360	5260360	Trouble in paradise.
5260360	5262360	Maybe then because you disgraced...
5262360	5264360	Hit articles on the blog.
5264360	5266360	Oh...
5266360	5268360	Except for Cassandra's.
5268360	5270360	How's that?
5273360	5275360	Curious, need to add that.
5275360	5278360	So he hit them on purpose except...
5278360	5280360	First the timeline, now the blog.
5280360	5281360	You have a lot to hide.
5281360	5282360	Hmm.
5282360	5286360	Abraham archived the first ones because they didn't want us to know.
5287360	5291360	Hit first articles and thought from other members in the public.
5291360	5294360	None of us could ever actually, I merely did the same with the rest
5294360	5296360	because that would also be in Abe's interest and Cass
5296360	5301360	wanted to show her article around.
5301360	5304360	What a strange development.
5306360	5308360	Oh, that guy that archived.
5308360	5310360	This gets more confusing by the minute.
5310360	5313360	Why don't you, why do you hide something on a group blog
5313360	5315360	from its own members?
5315360	5316360	A hidden agenda?
5316360	5320360	Oh please, I know you deleted all of your rebellious posts
5320360	5323360	to secure your cosy job and writing
5323360	5329360	that ridiculous opinion column for the TNB.
5331360	5334360	Wait, he writes...
5334360	5339360	He writes for the very thing he swore to destroy?
5340360	5342360	Hey, I read this one quite...
5342360	5344360	It wasn't at all where it was this guy.
5344360	5346360	Probably the thing don't know it.
5346360	5349360	You know, it's funny you dare speak of disgraces
5349360	5351360	when Rossin is the government's personal beat
5351360	5355360	because you didn't know, almost makes you the same.
5355360	5357360	So you really didn't hack then?
5357360	5358360	I didn't have a freaking clue.
5358360	5360360	Can you revert the changes?
5360360	5361360	You bet.
5361360	5364360	I'll even hunt down that son of a...
5364360	5365360	Just revert it, okay?
5365360	5366360	I don't care who did it.
5366360	5368360	I just can't stand her memories being toyed around.
5368360	5370360	Okay, okay, I'll be done in a minute, man.
5370360	5372360	I never could say no to you.
5372360	5374360	Oh, he's like a little puppy dog.
5376360	5378360	I will break you like that.
5380360	5381360	Okay, right.
5384360	5386360	Wait, so why is this red?
5386360	5388360	Or is it just red because it's new?
5388360	5390360	Probably just because it's new.
5390360	5391360	What's the albums?
5393360	5395360	I had a punk friend that he is now a real corporal
5395360	5396360	working for a bank.
5396360	5398360	I cry every time, you know.
5398360	5400360	Will we listen to the music?
5404360	5406360	Why is it only in my left ear?
5408360	5410360	Advertisement for the poor.
5412360	5414360	All right, I predict all right.
5414360	5418360	Oh, well, we've got an email from him.
5418360	5420360	That was literally only in my left ear.
5420360	5422360	I'm like, oh, thank you for donating me.
5422360	5423360	Excellent.
5424360	5427360	We will now have access to any emails coming in and out.
5427360	5428360	Oh, what's going on?
5428360	5429360	I see you.
5429360	5431360	Knock, knock, Harrison seems I caught your pants down
5431360	5433360	on that little page of yours.
5433360	5434360	Confused, that's fine.
5434360	5436360	You don't know me, and I like to keep it that way.
5436360	5438360	But I know a lot about you, media punk.
5438360	5439360	If I knew...
5439360	5441360	Oh, so he got scared.
5441360	5444360	If you knew what I know about...
5445360	5446360	What?
5446360	5448360	If you knew what I know,
5448360	5452360	what you know about what this little group of yours did,
5452360	5456360	you would find it just as hard to ignore
5456360	5460360	that those bomba might be carrying your name tag,
5460360	5462360	get what I'm talking about right.
5462360	5465360	So the Righteous Hacker initiate
5465360	5468360	will expose all information I got on you.
5468360	5470360	Might interest the cops.
5470360	5472360	I've no love for the government, but I'll do what I must.
5472360	5474360	So give me one good reason not to do it.
5476360	5480360	He got blackmailed by an anonymous person.
5481360	5482360	From initiate.
5482360	5483360	Oh, great.
5483360	5485360	Now there is a hacker involved in all this
5485360	5487360	because the situation wasn't bad enough already.
5487360	5489360	I wonder what this is about.
5489360	5491360	Let's find out.
5491360	5493360	Order confirmation.
5495360	5497360	Shoot, Angela?
5497360	5498360	Your bank account.
5498360	5500360	Okay, give me them bank account numbers.
5500360	5501360	Those are mine.
5501360	5502360	Those are not yours.
5503360	5505360	I don't know if we need a friggin' Angela.
5505360	5506360	Harrison sent...
5507360	5509360	No one cares about an Angela.
5509360	5510360	I see you.
5510360	5511360	Hey, wise ass.
5511360	5513360	This is the most pathetic attempt I've seen in a long time.
5513360	5514360	You want a goddamn reason?
5514360	5515360	I'll give you.
5515360	5516360	You hacked my site.
5516360	5517360	My website.
5517360	5518360	Last I checked.
5518360	5519360	That's illegal.
5519360	5520360	Something about glasshouse and stones.
5520360	5524360	I don't get what you want to have found out.
5524360	5525360	Oh, my God.
5525360	5526360	Am I reading this?
5526360	5530360	I don't get what you want to have found out about me.
5530360	5531360	True.
5531360	5532360	Our protest didn't go as planned,
5532360	5534360	but since you claim to know so much about me,
5534360	5535360	you shouldn't know.
5535360	5538360	That was hardly what I wanted was all in my blog.
5538360	5540360	In the blog, I mean.
5541360	5543360	It was getting hard to read.
5543360	5544360	It's not going well.
5544360	5546360	Not worried about the bomba.
5546360	5547360	Only grabbing attention.
5547360	5549360	Bet you'll be found out, huh?
5549360	5550360	With your mad skills.
5550360	5551360	Hey, good boy.
5551360	5553360	I'll throw you a breadcrumbs so you don't...
5553360	5554360	Mine.
5556360	5557360	Your dick.
5557360	5560360	I'm the wrong person to leave my page alone,
5560360	5562360	roll it back, and then don't there touch it.
5562360	5563360	Okay, okay, okay.
5563360	5564360	Sorry.
5564360	5565360	Shy.
5565360	5566360	Well, back off.
5566360	5568360	Right, why are the gigs highlighted?
5570360	5572360	So he quit the band,
5572360	5573360	and it's not conflicting,
5573360	5575360	so I'll just put he quit the band.
5578360	5580360	Internet vigilante easy.
5582360	5584360	The national opinion.
5584360	5586360	It really is by him.
5591360	5595360	There's three conflicting data chunks.
5596360	5597360	Oh, God.
5597360	5598360	Who knows?
5598360	5599360	Maybe the next one will go in the middle.
5599360	5603360	Predicted assault at a national museum.
5603360	5604360	I mean, we'll put that down
5604360	5606360	if he's predicting stuff.
5606360	5607360	He's been to the last two.
5607360	5608360	Okay.
5608360	5609360	Yes, the article.
5609360	5610360	That was strange indeed.
5610360	5611360	And with the bomba.
5612360	5613360	Jeez, Louise.
5613360	5614360	Juliet's timeline.
5614360	5616360	What's going on with you, Juliet?
5616360	5618360	I even organized...
5620360	5624360	You organized the peaceful protest on campus.
5626360	5627360	Right.
5627360	5632360	So Juliet did the campus organization.
5632360	5633360	Apparently there's information.
5633360	5634360	A house.
5636360	5639360	We're getting somewhere with you, Juliet.
5639360	5641360	She's somewhere from here.
5641360	5643360	The audio is a bit loud.
5643360	5646360	Like in-game audio or me.
5649360	5652360	I assume in-game audio got her address.
5652360	5653360	We got her ass.
5657360	5659360	I assume there's like nothing.
5659360	5662360	These are all like in-game audio.
5662360	5664360	I put it down by two decibels.
5664360	5665360	I didn't know.
5667360	5669360	I assume the red means there's something hidden on it
5669360	5671360	that I'm supposed to be looking at.
5675360	5677360	Is there more?
5679360	5681360	Oh, there's a new picture of them.
5682360	5683360	You're loud as fuck.
5683360	5684360	Oh, shit.
5684360	5686360	I'm actually...
5688360	5691360	You guys just tolerating this the entire time?
5695360	5696360	No, you're fine.
5696360	5697360	Oh, okay.
5698360	5699360	Comments.
5699360	5700360	I love you.
5700360	5701360	You're so amazing.
5701360	5703360	My new favorite band.
5703360	5704360	Greatest band of the nation.
5704360	5706360	Except for the proclaimers.
5706360	5707360	And stuff you did.
5707360	5708360	That was really good.
5709360	5711360	Please make yourself louder.
5711360	5712360	Wait, are you trolling?
5712360	5713360	You're trolling.
5715360	5716360	Okay, so...
5717360	5719360	We'll rinse the website.
5719360	5721360	Okay, we've got a new one.
5721360	5723360	Welcome to FBTN-
5723360	5725360	Wait, we can just straight up go into his bank?
5732360	5734360	I mean, he's got health insurance?
5735360	5736360	And he's...
5738360	5741360	A guy his age planning on doing something dangerous.
5741360	5743360	And then he needs medicine.
5743360	5745360	Comments are literally us for real.
5746360	5748360	That comment...
5751360	5752360	Whoa, what are you...
5752360	5753360	Oh, you got...
5754360	5755360	That...
5755360	5758360	See, that's an incentive to...
5759360	5762360	Do stuff against your actual personal beliefs.
5763360	5765360	If you're getting that kind of money for doing an article.
5765360	5768360	There's no way that's how much money you get for an article.
5768360	5770360	Must be the payment for writing the column.
5770360	5772360	Yeah, there's no way.
5774360	5776360	Can we delete this?
5776360	5777360	Oh my god, delete it please.
5777360	5780360	Delete it before I get booted out of his bank, please.
5782360	5784360	Delete it, delete it.
5785360	5786360	Okay, the...
5786360	5789360	Hancock's writing on the wall.
5789360	5791360	Is this his blog?
5792360	5793360	What is?
5798360	5799360	What?
5799360	5800360	After years,
5801360	5802360	What?
5802360	5804360	After years, my plan has taken shape.
5804360	5805360	It even has name thought.
5805360	5810360	Finally, counterpart to the radical regime of totalitarian surveillance.
5810360	5813360	And I'm glad to have a capable companion in this.
5813360	5815360	One who came up with the best idea for a demo, whatever.
5815360	5817360	I'm not gonna tell you this as far as...
5817360	5819360	I can only urge you to join us in our aim
5819360	5822360	to unleash this pitiful, pathetic wannabe democracy
5822360	5824360	of a country from its shackles.
5824360	5826360	From freedom is not free in a place
5826360	5829360	where every move is observed and analyzed.
5829360	5831360	Wait, so he made it?
5836360	5837360	Run around.
5837360	5839360	I already got a nice plan on.
5839360	5842360	As soon as I get myself a handful of like-minded people,
5842360	5845360	we're gonna occupy the university.
5845360	5848360	I bet we could scare those cardigan-wearing conformists
5848360	5850360	a great deal by showing our ugly faces.
5850360	5852360	Oh, how I'd love to see them running.
5855360	5857360	I already live in a trailer.
5860360	5861360	There we go.
5862360	5864360	Can play city skylings one day.
5864360	5865360	You can make a reefling city.
5865360	5866360	Oh, can I?
5866360	5867360	Oh, come on.
5867360	5870360	Can you please get any more stereotypical antisocial?
5870360	5871360	So what's the conflict?
5871360	5874360	Plan to occupy the university.
5883360	5885360	Planned a protest.
5890360	5894360	So he's, he, as soon as I get myself like,
5894360	5896360	we're gonna occupy.
5898360	5901360	But she said she planned it.
5904360	5907360	I think he's the mastermind behind it.
5907360	5909360	So we'll do occupy instead of protest.
5909360	5912360	It was an occupy he originally wanted to do.
5912360	5913360	Very well.
5913360	5916360	It is apparent, extreme, exactly as we suspected,
5916360	5919360	but we still have no idea about the third location.
5919360	5920360	You need to be diligent now.
5920360	5922360	Lives may be hanging in the balance.
5922360	5923360	In the worst case,
5923360	5925360	that we cannot determine the location on time.
5925360	5927360	Well, I might have to conduct an interrogation
5927360	5928360	with Miss Watergate.
5928360	5930360	I want to avoid it though, she's behaving
5930360	5932360	pretty defiantly, I've been told.
5932360	5934360	Looking at what you found so far,
5934360	5936360	I think I might have enough information
5936360	5938360	to put some pressure on her.
5941360	5943360	No, no, no, I'm not done reading the book yet.
5943360	5944360	Stop.
5945360	5946360	Knock, knock.
5946360	5948360	The thoughts are free once again.
5948360	5951360	We are not done yet, you and me.
5951360	5954360	But first, on, I must turn to another.
5956360	5958360	I can't even find the word to him.
5958360	5961360	Stupid, rejects government's proposition.
5962360	5965360	And then the confliction is...
5965360	5968360	No, so he doesn't actually support it.
5968360	5969360	He got a fat paycheck,
5969360	5972360	so whatever the other confliction is.
5973360	5974360	Outskirts.
5975360	5976360	Camping?
5976360	5978360	He lives in a camping ground.
5978360	5980360	Okay, we've got this location.
5980360	5982360	Nothing wrong with cardigans,
5982360	5983360	leave the cardigans alone.
5983360	5984360	That's one ugly place,
5984360	5985360	but I guess it's cheap.
5985360	5987360	Okay, so I'm gonna wait.
5988360	5990360	There are so many updates.
5990360	5993360	Okay, user, fricking...
5994360	5995360	What?
5998360	5999360	Archived, archived.
5999360	6001360	We can still archived.
6001360	6002360	The website's back.
6002360	6004360	Everything's archived.
6008360	6009360	Mm-mm.
6009360	6010360	Everything?
6010360	6011360	Okay, would you need that?
6011360	6012360	Entry 8.
6013360	6014360	Just here?
6014360	6016360	No, we've just got access to it again.
6017360	6019360	Okay, we've just got access to it again.
6019360	6020360	That's hot.
6022360	6023360	Seems like...
6024360	6025360	Ever family?
6025360	6027360	There's something lurking on ever family.
6027360	6028360	Whatever it is.
6029360	6031360	What is it that's lurking?
6033360	6034360	Okay, playing the guitar
6034360	6036360	proves that she was definitely in the band.
6036360	6037360	I'll allow it.
6041360	6043360	Favorite color, red?
6043360	6045360	Does this even have anything to do with anything?
6045360	6048360	I feel like I'm just clogging up the system.
6049360	6052360	Okay, I like jokes as much as the next person.
6052360	6055360	But our favorite color, do you really think that is...?
6055360	6057360	Okay, there is a bomb threat.
6057360	6058360	Could you please focus on that?
6058360	6059360	Okay, I'm sorry.
6059360	6060360	I'm sorry.
6060360	6061360	I'm sorry.
6061360	6063360	I'm sorry.
6063360	6065360	Okay, I got a little distracted.
6065360	6066360	Okay, wall attacks.
6066360	6068360	The important thing is here.
6068360	6069360	Leave a message.
6070360	6071360	The alien.
6074360	6077360	I'm looking for people willing to join a thought.
6077360	6078360	I can live it up.
6079360	6080360	Oh.
6081360	6082360	Wait.
6087360	6088360	By pure coincidence,
6088360	6089360	I stumbled on it.
6089360	6091360	Frankly, you're thinking in your attitude
6091360	6092360	to get people thinking
6092360	6094360	is left an impression on me.
6094360	6097360	So the professor
6097360	6099360	messaged him.
6100360	6103360	The professor didn't recruit them.
6105360	6106360	Thank you for joining.
6107360	6109360	I feel a little confused now.
6110360	6111360	Is this thought a blog,
6111360	6112360	an activist group,
6112360	6113360	or a debate club,
6113360	6114360	or all three?
6114360	6116360	They're just really good at master debating.
6116360	6117360	Okay.
6120360	6122360	This is curious.
6122360	6123360	I can't even find the words.
6125360	6126360	Okay.
6129360	6132360	We need to find that third debate club invitation.
6137360	6141360	There is no way they put old memes in this.
6141360	6142360	Are you joking?
6143360	6144360	Favorite color, red.
6144360	6145360	Red.
6145360	6146360	Red wire.
6146360	6147360	Bomba.
6147360	6148360	Color red wire.
6148360	6149360	Exactly.
6149360	6150360	They put an old meme.
6150360	6152360	Ain't nobody got time for that.
6152360	6153360	Why is that donkey?
6154360	6156360	Little donkey.
6157360	6159360	Carry me.
6160360	6162360	On the dust.
6162360	6165360	So Nina, you will be very recruited.
6165360	6166360	Nina.
6167360	6168360	Nina.
6170360	6171360	Nina, Nina, Nina.
6172360	6173360	I don't know who Nina is.
6175360	6176360	So there's another member
6176360	6177360	we haven't even heard of.
6177360	6179360	I would request clearance to make our target.
6179360	6180360	We got the green light.
6180360	6182360	They instantly give the green light.
6182360	6185360	At concerned one, Nina.
6186360	6188360	Oh, that was that comment on the blog.
6191360	6193360	What a strange alias name.
6195360	6197360	Ain't nobody got time for that.
6198360	6200360	If someone's comment,
6201360	6202360	no comment.
6202360	6203360	No, there was a comment.
6205360	6206360	There it is, concerned.
6208360	6211360	No, we will carry into the streets of the nation,
6211360	6214360	be transformed in the re-implanted back of their minds
6214360	6218360	an invi-is-able idea that we shall always be free.
6218360	6221360	Declare thought to be a revolutionary act of this group.
6222360	6224360	Yes, I'm getting that vibe too.
6225360	6227360	Donkey Girl for Gen 2.
6227360	6229360	You guys are getting absolutely annihilated
6229360	6231360	next week when we actually draw the concert.
6232360	6233360	So an activist group after all
6233360	6235360	and now we know who had the primary say in it.
6239360	6241360	Any plans to restrict first?
6243360	6244360	Oh!
6245360	6247360	So what about holding a proclamation
6247360	6249360	on a government building then?
6250360	6251360	Sounds like a worthy first demo.
6252360	6253360	A proclamation?
6254360	6256360	We should go first storm in the malls.
6260360	6261360	What?
6263360	6264360	My friends,
6264360	6267360	though I show your enthusiasm towards getting the people,
6267360	6268360	it would be better to avoid
6269360	6271360	as a place of demonstration.
6271360	6273360	Ah, what pay, but you're probably right.
6273360	6277360	So what about holding a proclamation on a government building?
6279360	6282360	It was the Boston,
6282360	6284360	although I know we want to gather more people to join,
6284360	6286360	we should not discuss the matter.
6286360	6288360	There are eyes that might be malicious.
6290360	6292360	So it's a government building.
6296360	6298360	He plans stuff, so it's him.
6303360	6304360	The government, holy, that must be it.
6304360	6305360	That's through the third bomba.
6305360	6307360	But which one didn't say?
6307360	6308360	That's it.
6309360	6310360	Alright, if that's all we have,
6310360	6311360	it's what we have to work with.
6311360	6313360	So let's get the interrogation thing going
6313360	6314360	before we run out of time.
6315360	6317360	I'm actually located in the same facility
6317360	6319360	where Miss Wargay has been detained.
6319360	6321360	I will have her move to an interrogation room
6321360	6323360	and walk across to cover my identity.
6323360	6326360	I will connect to her via a wire.
6326360	6328360	Let's just hope that you have provided,
6330360	6331360	gives us enough leverage.
6331360	6334360	I will open a connection for you to eavesdrop.
6334360	6336360	After all, this is your case too.
6336360	6338360	Plus we need all the possible info found.
6339360	6341360	I'm not ready yet, hold on.
6341360	6343360	You're like thrusting me into this.
6344360	6347360	Hostile towards government?
6351360	6352360	Rejects government.
6354360	6355360	See, hostile?
6356360	6357360	I think he rejects.
6357360	6359360	I'm just going to put rejection.
6359360	6360360	I have no idea.
6361360	6364360	Anything else that would become a surprise?
6364360	6365360	Oh my god.
6365360	6366360	I'm not ready.
6366360	6367360	Okay, what's going on?
6367360	6369360	Right, we're listening to the interrogation.
6369360	6371360	Stop saying stuff like this.
6371360	6372360	Don't get hooked.
6372360	6373360	Who is this?
6373360	6375360	Why can't you just leave me alone?
6375360	6376360	Miss Watergate?
6376360	6377360	My name is Syme.
6378360	6379360	Great, Symes, can you go-
6380360	6382360	I already told the other guys everything over and over again.
6382360	6384360	It wasn't me who hurt the officer.
6385360	6387360	We have new evidence that states otherwise,
6387360	6389360	which is why you are in custody.
6390360	6392360	But that's not what this is about.
6392360	6395360	We are investigating the bomber at Freedom Plaza.
6396360	6398360	I just want to ask you some questions.
6398360	6399360	Cooperate?
6399360	6401360	Oh god, I cannot read that fast.
6401360	6402360	Are you joking?
6402360	6403360	You might reflect positive.
6403360	6405360	Oh, and you want to frame me?
6405360	6407360	I've been so busy.
6407360	6411360	I was right here imprisoned while I did the bomber.
6411360	6413360	We know you didn't trigger the bomber,
6413360	6416360	maybe not even the one at Freedom Plaza.
6416360	6417360	But we do know, however,
6417360	6419360	you have been in close contact with a group called Thought.
6419360	6420360	What?
6420360	6421360	They have nothing to do with this.
6421360	6423360	I want to talk to my lawyer right now.
6423360	6425360	You mean that boyfriend of yours?
6425360	6427360	Joseph Langlin.
6427360	6428360	My boyfriend?
6428360	6429360	How do you know that?
6429360	6432360	We know a lot about you, Miss Watergate.
6432360	6434360	I don't need to call him then.
6434360	6435360	No shovel.
6435360	6438360	Your defiance towards me is not advisable.
6438360	6440360	What about your parents?
6440360	6441360	Bruno and Alice?
6441360	6443360	They've got a nice company, don't they?
6443360	6445360	Association with a criminal case against their daughter.
6445360	6447360	Yeah, again, could hurt them badly.
6447360	6449360	Last time I was in custody,
6449360	6453360	all they ever did about it was suggesting I'd leave my position.
6454360	6457360	Does that give you the impression of a perfect family?
6457360	6459360	Well, have it your way then.
6459360	6464360	We have your confession in regards to that nasty incident with the police officer.
6464360	6466360	You'll have to go through the whole process again.
6466360	6469360	It's gonna drag on for a long time.
6469360	6471360	And where did you get this supposed confession?
6471360	6473360	I never did anything.
6473360	6476360	Miss Carrington stated this in a conversation with you.
6476360	6480360	Have you been spying on us, you dirty little government?
6480360	6484360	Well, I hope you also noticed that she started this in defence.
6484360	6486360	Indeed, we did know that.
6486360	6487360	That doesn't.
6487360	6489360	That does mean you have nothing on me.
6489360	6491360	It seems my colleagues didn't tell you.
6491360	6495360	You have been arrested as potentially dangerous, did they?
6495360	6496360	Potentially dangerous.
6496360	6498360	I like the sound of that.
6498360	6499360	Me?
6499360	6501360	Me so dangerous.
6501360	6503360	This is not a joke, Miss Watergate.
6503360	6505360	See, it's all in this profile here,
6505360	6508360	in accordance with the safety bill people have assessed,
6508360	6511360	as potentially dangerous may be held in custody for a very long time
6511360	6513360	until they are deemed no longer a threat.
6513360	6516360	BS, you can't just make something and flag me as dangerous
6516360	6518360	just because it suits your case.
6518360	6520360	It's an official investigation result
6520360	6522360	and we can double that time span.
6522360	6524360	You'll sit in here with the police record linkers.
6524360	6526360	No, why?
6526360	6529360	I hope you will link yourself and your cellmates,
6529360	6533360	but cooperate and avoid this at once.
6533360	6535360	Why are you doing this to me?
6535360	6537360	Just answer my questions
6537360	6539360	and I might be able to help.
6539360	6541360	I don't know what you expect from me.
6541360	6543360	I first went to the Plaza demo.
6543360	6545360	I don't know much about their plans.
6545360	6547360	We know that Mr. O'Donnell
6547360	6550360	had plans to have a kind of proclamation
6550360	6552360	on the roof of a government building.
6552360	6553360	Do you know which one?
6553360	6555360	Government building?
6555360	6557360	I never heard of anything like that.
6557360	6559360	I think Miss Watergate,
6559360	6561360	they have had mentioned anything remotely like that.
6561360	6562360	Damn it.
6562360	6563360	I don't know.
6563360	6564360	There is nothing.
6564360	6566360	There has got to be something.
6566360	6567360	Talk!
6567360	6570360	No, there is never...
6570360	6572360	I swear, I don't...
6572360	6575360	This is it, Miss Watergate.
6575360	6577360	This interrogation is over.
6579360	6581360	I did not go planned at all, not at all.
6581360	6584360	I wonder if we went wrong about this place.
6584360	6585360	Oops.
6585360	6586360	So what do we do now?
6586360	6588360	We run out of time and options.
6588360	6591360	Evacuate just by making an educated guess
6591360	6594360	that would cause a PR disaster.
6594360	6597360	We need ideas and fast, else...
6599360	6600360	I'm sure we're too late.
6600360	6602360	No, no, no, no, no, no!
6602360	6604360	We could have prevented this.
6604360	6605360	Was it the mall?
6605360	6606360	If only...
6606360	6607360	I don't know, shit.
6607360	6609360	There's got to be some serious fallout.
6609360	6611360	I'll do what I can to keep us in a job.
6611360	6613360	I think I need fired if it was at the mall.
6613360	6615360	We need to pull this group apart.
6615360	6618360	Tomorrow we'll have a serious Nina.
6618360	6619360	Until then, you're dismissed.
6619360	6620360	Wait.
6620360	6621360	Was it at the...
6621360	6623360	Oops, sorry, wrong one.
6625360	6627360	It was the mall!
6627360	6630360	Wait, how is that supposed to pick either or?
6630360	6633360	Was that supposed to know that he wasn't organizing stuff?
6635360	6636360	It was the mall.
6636360	6638360	So it was Nina.
6643360	6645360	No way I got rolled.
6646360	6649360	So the conflicting information?
6656360	6658360	She didn't know Nina doesn't...
6660360	6662360	Oh, she messed up the organized.
6662360	6663360	Interesting.
6663360	6664360	What did she do?
6666360	6667360	It wasn't Nina.
6667360	6669360	Rip hot topic, honestly.
6669360	6670360	You will be missed.
6671360	6673360	Oh, that's so frustrating.
6673360	6675360	Okay, I understand.
6677360	6679360	Anyone knows this game has multiple endings?
6679360	6680360	It definitely has multiple endings
6680360	6683360	because I never unlocked the correct ending.
6687360	6689360	Everything looks fine.
6691360	6692360	Are you sure?
6692360	6693360	Yeah, sure.
6693360	6694360	Whatever I've missed, I've missed.
6694360	6695360	I got an achievement.
6695360	6697360	Complete episode 2.
6697360	6698360	He was...
6698360	6700360	Okay, so...
6701360	6704360	We picked up a lot of information.
6707360	6709360	So we need Nina.
6710360	6712360	Harrison's been cleared.
6712360	6714360	Juliet wasn't even a suspect.
6714360	6715360	Again, Abraham says,
6715360	6716360	Oh, Nina?
6720360	6721360	Unperson.
6726360	6728360	Here we are again after having steered into the bus
6728360	6730360	not unscathed but alive and still with a job.
6730360	6732360	I was able to keep us in the business.
6732360	6734360	My superiors don't want to give up on Orwell just yet.
6734360	6736360	Needless to say, we cannot
6736360	6738360	afford to repeat a failure like yesterday.
6738360	6742360	The TMB is already starting to tear us apart, Lisa!
6742360	6745360	This Nina character is a final member of thought
6745360	6747360	and we don't have concrete info.
6747360	6749360	Since Harrison's plan with the government building
6749360	6750360	turned out to be a dead end,
6750360	6752360	we need to get a clearer picture of the loose.
6752360	6754360	Her stance towards law enforcement
6754360	6756360	just gives us one more reason
6756360	6758360	as you found out yesterday.
6758360	6761360	Focus on Nina, but keep watching all the others too.
6761360	6764360	Sorry, I kind of thought you wanted to go to my bedtime.
6767360	6768360	My part.
6769360	6771360	Hey, forgot to charge my phone last night.
6771360	6773360	So yeah, I have to do it the old fashioned way.
6773360	6775360	I really want to thank you for a nice evening.
6777360	6779360	Only to be topped by that night.
6779360	6780360	That's it.
6780360	6782360	I was hoping you'd drop your...
6782360	6784360	by CCC to come pick me up.
6785360	6787360	The girl was yammering about...
6788360	6790360	opposes the safety bill.
6793360	6794360	Hi, Mark.
6794360	6796360	Is she be about to come online?
6799360	6801360	Why would anyone oppose the safety bill?
6801360	6803360	We have the lowest crime rate in years or possibly ever.
6803360	6806360	You and me, we have the job thanks to the bill.
6806360	6810360	The only reason to not support is if you have a dirty, dirty past.
6810360	6812360	But the situation is here as it is.
6812360	6815360	It's like someone we should have a very close look at.
6815360	6818360	We need to fill examination.
6818360	6820360	First, a concrete background on who.
6820360	6822360	Second, what motivators.
6822360	6827360	And finally, where was she around the time of the bomba?
6827360	6828360	Let's find out.
6828360	6830360	Where are the headlines?
6830360	6832360	Catastrophe strikes.
6832360	6833360	One passed away.
6835360	6837360	Then for doing a donut time.
6837360	6839360	Mummy...
6841360	6842360	Enough of the dirty past.
6842360	6844360	Let's talk about my dirty future.
6848360	6852360	Maybe really endangered by lawsuit against the rector.
6852360	6853360	The surrounding.
6854360	6856360	The national opinion.
6856360	6857360	And last week, no.
6858360	6861360	Predicted assaults only to sell his point to the column.
6861360	6863360	Condemns the bomba.
6863360	6865360	Predicts the bomba.
6867360	6871360	Wait, so what is his stance of that?
6873360	6875360	A strange way to sell one's point.
6875360	6879360	It's still peculiarly mentioned bomba before anything happened, but well.
6879360	6881360	Are you squiddin' me right now?
6881360	6882360	Ah!
6882360	6885360	So are we creating the scenario from the marrow?
6885360	6887360	No! Broly legend.
6887360	6888360	Thank you for the tip.
6888360	6891360	If it's the marrow or my bad, no.
6891360	6895360	Prosecure calls on people to take care of their own safety.
6895360	6898360	Wait, is he completely not going punk anymore?
6898360	6900360	And he's back to Wolf?
6901360	6904360	I'm getting confused now.
6906360	6910360	We cannot save everyone, but we're still a watchful eye on the nation.
6910360	6912360	Is he completely...
6912360	6914360	Hey kiddo, you're absolutely right.
6914360	6916360	One could call that even a mind blown.
6916360	6918360	But let's not stay at my place tonight.
6919360	6920360	Okay.
6920360	6922360	It's unfit for a lady.
6922360	6924360	No lovers hidden there.
6924360	6926360	I'm done with her because of...
6927360	6928360	Okay.
6930360	6931360	Okay, okay, okay.
6931360	6933360	New girlfriend got it.
6934360	6935360	Thank you sir.
6935360	6936360	Anina, you mean anything?
6936360	6938360	Oh, Juliet and Harrison, where'd you go?
6938360	6939360	That's...
6939360	6940360	That one's news to me.
6940360	6941360	Guess it didn't matter.
6941360	6942360	Now that's over.
6942360	6943360	Oh, I thought it wasn't.
6943360	6945360	Anything will set me off.
6945360	6946360	Angry at birth.
6946360	6947360	Get angry at birth.
6947360	6948360	Angry at birth.
6948360	6951360	She was my partner in crime a while ago.
6954360	6956360	I think that's just a saying.
6957360	6961360	Oh no, it's the only thing I can pick information from, I think.
6962360	6964360	Making Gen 2 is supposed to be a private affair.
6964360	6965360	Exactly.
6966360	6968360	We'll be making it very soon together.
6969360	6970360	Since then.
6971360	6972360	Anything?
6973360	6975360	The edited movie poster.
6975360	6976360	Oh, go on then.
6976360	6978360	A hundred gray shadows.
6978360	6981360	I thought that was going to be a 50 shades of gray.
6981360	6983360	50 shades of gray.
6983360	6985360	A hundred gray shadows.
6985360	6986360	Okay.
6987360	6989360	Quit fooling around.
6989360	6991360	War on indifference.
6991360	6993360	Oh, this is done by Nina.
6997360	6999360	Okay, Nina, you're going down.
6999360	7000360	You wait for it.
7001360	7002360	Just confess, get him.
7006360	7008360	Right, let me just check.
7008360	7010360	So, war on indifference.
7010360	7015360	Indifference towards our own rights is the worst enemy than the government itself.
7016360	7017360	What?
7017360	7019360	Okay, so how...
7020360	7023360	How you in particular incited the crowd to directly threaten the visitors.
7023360	7025360	Intended to scare them.
7026360	7029360	You intended to scare them and nuke them?
7030360	7033360	That was a bit of a miscalculation, was it not?
7033360	7037360	Scaring people to get attention to one's message, really, is this what thought is about?
7037360	7041360	You know what I agree with being oblivious in the matter is the problem...
7041360	7043360	Roots, problem, problem, roots.
7043360	7045360	We've discussed this many times.
7045360	7047360	What the heck?
7048360	7050360	Violence cannot be the key.
7050360	7052360	Condemned violence, okay.
7052360	7055360	So Abraham's old school, but Nina...
7056360	7058360	That was really...
7059360	7063360	We got a little bit carried away in the info, we're finally getting our message out there.
7063360	7066360	Now this is recent, Hancock is confusing the crap out of me.
7066360	7068360	I think he's just getting a paycheck.
7070360	7073360	She didn't plan to stream today as far as I see, no navigation, okay.
7073360	7075360	Is Emmy coming on?
7075360	7080360	Afterwards they're clever and feel sorry about their actions, it's always the same.
7080360	7083360	I mean, people are allowed to feel remorse.
7083360	7084360	Stereo.
7084360	7086360	Unknown person and Nina.
7087360	7088360	He's still...
7088360	7090360	Oh, stop giving me new people.
7090360	7092360	I can't remember everyone.
7093360	7095360	Just wanted to ask if everyone's fine.
7097360	7099360	Yeah, don't worry, we're having a great time.
7099360	7100360	Okay.
7100360	7102360	Emmy, it comes on in two hours.
7102360	7103360	Okay, okay, okay.
7103360	7106360	Thank you for taking care, even though it's Saturday.
7106360	7107360	Don't mention it, Smile.
7107360	7109360	How are you feeling?
7109360	7112360	I think we're gonna have to play the last two chapters tomorrow.
7112360	7115360	My brain is absolutely killing it.
7115360	7118360	Nina, I hate to say it, but don't hold it against me, okay?
7118360	7120360	I'm fine.
7120360	7122360	Why are you fine?
7123360	7124360	No, you're not.
7124360	7126360	You always look so sad.
7126360	7128360	Often sad now.
7128360	7130360	That's not anything to do with anything.
7130360	7133360	No, don't worry about anything new on the love front, no.
7134360	7136360	God, you're really hard to talk to.
7136360	7137360	These one...
7137360	7140360	These like two cents replies are awful.
7140360	7143360	Only idiots on the singular portal thing you recommended.
7143360	7146360	Ooh, we might have a connection.
7146360	7148360	Related document.
7148360	7150360	Understand we didn't get any risks.
7150360	7151360	Where?
7151360	7155360	My dad's so understanding about it, like he took me to a cafe
7155360	7159360	and I stupidly ordered the fry up thinking it was gonna be like a British fry up.
7159360	7163360	It was not obviously a British fry up, so I was raging eating it.
7163360	7169360	Because I was like, why the fuck did I honestly think this was gonna be a real fry up?
7169360	7172360	Felt like an absolute twat, like of course.
7172360	7173360	Of course it's not.
7173360	7174360	Right, singular.
7174360	7176360	Ooh, don't be single.
7176360	7178360	Be singular.
7180360	7182360	Continue to your profile.
7184360	7186360	This is her.
7186360	7187360	Oh, you're done for.
7187360	7188360	We got you.
7188360	7189360	Oh, we got your height as well.
7189360	7191360	Oh, it's over for you.
7192360	7193360	Oh, we know your location.
7193360	7194360	Oh, it's over.
7195360	7196360	All is to find a man.
7196360	7198360	October 1985.
7198360	7199360	Looking for him.
7199360	7201360	She's a man.
7201360	7202360	She's heterosexual.
7203360	7204360	Oh, sure.
7204360	7206360	We'll do height for profile description.
7208360	7209360	Okay.
7209360	7210360	Hiking, climbing, agent for the wheel.
7210360	7211360	Suits.
7211360	7212360	She's doing the bullet.
7212360	7214360	Late dinner, Stephen Baldwin.
7214360	7216360	Well, we've got a picture.
7216360	7217360	Go to Jim.
7217360	7219360	Jim knows how to train.
7219360	7221360	What a weirdo.
7222360	7223360	She's looking.
7223360	7226360	Your, your opinions.
7226360	7227360	Ooh.
7227360	7230360	Financial stability.
7231360	7235360	How long do you wish for your next relationship to last?
7236360	7241360	Don't these websites not date to, like, have,
7241360	7243360	like, a forever relationship?
7243360	7244360	Am I going crazy?
7244360	7247360	Would you consider allowing your partner to see other people?
7248360	7250360	She's sowing in.
7252360	7256360	Would you consider dating someone who does not want our disliked children?
7256360	7257360	No.
7257360	7258360	Oh, she want to birth them babies.
7258360	7259360	Okay.
7259360	7261360	What place would you like to go on vacation?
7261360	7262360	Cities.
7262360	7263360	Seaside.
7263360	7264360	Man, countryside.
7264360	7265360	Cities.
7265360	7267360	There's so much to do in the cities.
7267360	7269360	Oh, she polyamorous.
7269360	7271360	How interested in polytricks are you?
7271360	7272360	Quite a bit.
7272360	7273360	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
7273360	7275360	Are you a cat or dog person?
7277360	7278360	Oh, yeah.
7278360	7279360	Oh, I guess cat.
7279360	7284360	If you turn a, if you turn a left-handed glove inside out, it fits.
7285360	7288360	Wait, is this a logic question?
7288360	7289360	Stop, hold on.
7289360	7294360	If you turn a left-handed glove inside out, it fits the left hand.
7296360	7298360	Is it still a left-handed glove?
7299360	7301360	I like the countryside as well.
7301360	7302360	What are the other questions?
7304360	7306360	What are you looking for in a partner?
7306360	7309360	True love, honesty, fidelity?
7309360	7310360	What's fidelity?
7310360	7313360	Isn't infidelity what people get killed for?
7314360	7315360	I'm going crazy.
7315360	7321360	Social connection, communication, humor, financial, acceptance, openness, independence, casual fun.
7321360	7325360	Acceptance and true love.
7326360	7327360	Me and the Wraithling.
7331360	7332360	Oh, faith.
7332360	7334360	Oh, well, we ain't checking that box.
7334360	7335360	Sorry.
7336360	7339360	I am your, you can have faith in me.
7339360	7340360	What's this?
7340360	7341360	Conversate.
7341360	7342360	To start a new conversation.
7342360	7343360	Hey, I just saw your profile.
7344360	7346360	Super Randy.
7349360	7351360	Why Sam, but not Samwise.
7351360	7353360	Hi, concerns.
7353360	7354360	Oh my God.
7354360	7356360	By the way, it's Molly.
7356360	7357360	Oh, we've got a name.
7359360	7360360	We've got a name.
7360360	7361360	Thank you, Samwise Gamgee.
7361360	7363360	You helped us progress the floor.
7364360	7366360	She's using such a peculiar one of that.
7368360	7369360	Why?
7374360	7375360	It's my son?
7375360	7376360	She has a wane?
7380360	7381360	Or is this fake?
7381360	7382360	Wait, is this conversation fake?
7382360	7383360	Hi.
7383360	7384360	Hi, Sam.
7384360	7385360	It's Kevin Freshman.
7385360	7386360	We're going to date.
7386360	7388360	Just send me to a local Chinese.
7388360	7389360	I don't care.
7389360	7390360	By the way, my name is Molly.
7390360	7391360	You got my Molly.
7391360	7392360	Oh, maybe she does have a wane.
7392360	7393360	All right, you got a wane.
7397360	7398360	A single mother, huh?
7398360	7402360	Doesn't seem like the type to be involved with such things, right?
7402360	7405360	What about your conversation with Superman?
7405360	7406360	Blondie, seriously?
7406360	7408360	Everyone call me Blondie.
7408360	7409360	Great, me too.
7409360	7410360	So where are we going now?
7410360	7411360	We're not.
7411360	7412360	Now I totally get why you're there.
7412360	7413360	You're still single.
7413360	7414360	I can't believe it.
7414360	7415360	That's hilarious.
7417360	7420360	So, I didn't even reply to him.
7421360	7423360	Well, she didn't reply to him.
7424360	7425360	What else?
7425360	7426360	I don't know.
7429360	7430360	I don't know.
7430360	7432360	It's a phlegic for her description.
7433360	7434360	I'll take it.
7434360	7435360	Does she go to gym?
7435360	7437360	Maybe she go to gym.
7438360	7443360	For daily's faithfulness and religious practice or loyal in a relationship.
7446360	7447360	Oh, Amy published the new ASMR.
7447360	7448360	I see bloggers.
7449360	7450360	She's catfishing.
7451360	7452360	I don't know.
7452360	7454360	There's something on that page I'm missing.
7456360	7462360	Okay, I've definitely missed something about your conversations or something else here.
7463360	7464360	Okay, sure.
7464360	7465360	Temporary.
7465360	7466360	Why not?
7467360	7468360	Oh, God.
7468360	7469360	May I relay a document?
7469360	7475360	See, something you think is not logged in on her account.
7476360	7477360	New profile picture.
7477360	7478360	Go for it.
7480360	7481360	See, recent jobs.
7481360	7483360	What are you being doing?
7484360	7488360	Has worked in multiple jobs during the week.
7489360	7492360	But we've not found the conflicting data yet.
7494360	7495360	We'll work a lot.
7499360	7502360	We've got an email.
7503360	7504360	She hit the wall hard.
7505360	7506360	Reef blend.
7507360	7509360	She's not supposed to be rude.
7509360	7510360	Examination.
7510360	7511360	Dear miss.
7512360	7513360	Miss Nova.
7513360	7516360	Just as the prime minister leaves the weather is getting even more.
7517360	7518360	Cancel the meeting.
7522360	7523360	He canceled the meeting.
7523360	7524360	What is that?
7526360	7527360	What does it mean?
7528360	7529360	Right, listen.
7531360	7533360	Nina's got a patient number.
7535360	7536360	Not a strong word.
7537360	7539360	There are no pathological findings.
7540360	7541360	Oh, okay.
7541360	7542360	She's got blood tests done.
7543360	7544360	Wait, she's got a new, new name?
7545360	7546360	Miss Nova.
7547360	7548360	Ooh, we got it.
7551360	7553360	We're hacking into her medical database.
7560360	7562360	This is her private information.
7563360	7565360	Well, that's where she lives.
7567360	7568360	I've got her leg.
7568360	7569360	Perfect.
7569360	7571360	And address is always helpful.
7571360	7572360	I've got her leg.
7574360	7575360	Has injury on life.
7575360	7576360	Like a medical leave.
7577360	7580360	I saw a medical leave until April.
7581360	7582360	Show conflict.
7583360	7584360	She's been employed.
7586360	7589360	Pain is mostly due to a prior infected wound.
7590360	7591360	Compressment damaging.
7592360	7595360	Sometimes we're similar to those of Mara.
7596360	7601360	The patient has been strongly advised to favor the leg
7601360	7602360	to avoid complications.
7603360	7605360	Prescribe take two times a day.
7605360	7607360	Advise patient to come back if symptoms don't improve.
7608360	7610360	I don't know what to do.
7615360	7616360	That's illegal.
7617360	7620360	Infidels used by religious people to differentiate
7620360	7622360	between people who are not part of the religious.
7622360	7623360	Yeah, I found that.
7624360	7627360	Hello there little jewel bug.
7628360	7629360	Welcome to Tech June.
7629360	7630360	It's so great to hear you.
7630360	7631360	Yeah, you too.
7631360	7632360	That's why I called.
7632360	7633360	It was about time.
7635360	7637360	Did you know I was working today?
7638360	7640360	Sorry, I forgot for a second.
7640360	7641360	You actually know me.
7641360	7642360	Feeling stressed.
7642360	7643360	Boss causing trouble.
7643360	7644360	I can call back.
7644360	7645360	Oh, no, no, no.
7645360	7647360	Hanging around the office just as who's, you know,
7647360	7648360	not to be at home.
7648360	7649360	I see.
7649360	7651360	I never got why you moved back and then the first place.
7651360	7653360	I had to leave my student apartment.
7653360	7654360	You know that.
7654360	7657360	And you know that a super lame excuse.
7657360	7659360	You earned good money at the tech.
7659360	7660360	Don't you?
7660360	7661360	You could rent a flat in town.
7661360	7662360	You just don't want to.
7663360	7665360	I see you're not going to relent.
7666360	7667360	Nope.
7667360	7668360	Sorry.
7668360	7669360	I had a pretty rough start into this year.
7669360	7671360	I couldn't really stand being alone at the time.
7672360	7673360	I feel,
7674360	7675360	I feel much better now,
7675360	7677360	but mum, dad, they're so happy I'm back.
7677360	7678360	I don't want to disappoint them.
7678360	7679360	Oh, you don't want to.
7679360	7680360	Yeah.
7680360	7681360	I can't do that to them.
7681360	7682360	Not again.
7682360	7683360	And I hear, I,
7683360	7685360	and I hear,
7685360	7686360	I was thinking,
7687360	7688360	I think that's the wrong spell in here.
7688360	7689360	I'm like,
7689360	7690360	I have.
7690360	7691360	No, you haven't.
7691360	7693360	You're letting yourself be hassled by mum and dad yet again.
7693360	7694360	It's the sister.
7697360	7698360	It's the sister.
7698360	7699360	They're sisters.
7700360	7701360	Wait, what?
7701360	7702360	No.
7702360	7703360	You're letting yourself be hassled by mum and dad again.
7703360	7704360	What?
7704360	7705360	I'm so confused.
7705360	7706360	Yeah.
7706360	7708360	I'm so envious when dad called you his little June bug.
7710360	7711360	No, what?
7711360	7712360	Am I going crazy?
7712360	7714360	They have two different surnames.
7716360	7717360	But office is empty.
7717360	7719360	Yeah, my to-do list is so long.
7719360	7721360	Okay, let's talk another time.
7721360	7722360	I will call you again.
7722360	7724360	Do not try to reach me.
7724360	7725360	Ha ha ha.
7725360	7726360	Just kidding.
7726360	7727360	June?
7727360	7728360	Yep.
7728360	7730360	Thank you for holding me.
7730360	7732360	Aw, look at you sending so seriously.
7732360	7733360	Wait, am I going crazy?
7736360	7738360	Who the fuck is June bug?
7739360	7741360	See you around June bug.
7745360	7747360	And she's calling her June.
7748360	7749360	June bug.
7749360	7750360	What weird nickname is that?
7750360	7752360	It's just a nickname.
7752360	7753360	Alia.
7753360	7754360	What?
7754360	7756360	Who the heck is Nina?
7756360	7759360	So why is Nina not getting active?
7759360	7761360	It's a pretty rough start to this y'all.
7761360	7763360	I was working today.
7763360	7766360	June and June bug had their sister through the chat.
7766360	7767360	Oh, right.
7767360	7768360	Okay, I knew it.
7769360	7770360	What are you looking at?
7771360	7772360	Remarried?
7773360	7774360	One might be married.
7778360	7779360	I'm confused.
7779360	7780360	Sorry, I need to take my bra off.
7782360	7783360	I'm not comfy.
7783360	7784360	Sorry to bring that over nowhere.
7784360	7785360	I'm not comfy in it.
7785360	7786360	I need to take it off.
7787360	7788360	Get this bait.
7788360	7789360	I shed off a bait.
7794360	7796360	Oh, it's a fucking sports bra.
7798360	7801360	So it pushes down against my chest when I breathe.
7807360	7809360	Doesn't one of them have two wings?
7814360	7816360	Okay, let me hydrate with some water.
7816360	7817360	Please do hydrate as well.
7817360	7820360	What we'll do is we'll play until Emmy comes on
7820360	7824360	or my brain short fuses out.
7824360	7826360	It turns into a coat wreck.
7826360	7827360	More like turns into the carpet.
7827360	7829360	It's on the floor right now.
7833360	7835360	You got the last two hours for me.
7835360	7838360	Oh, my reading comprehension is out the window already though.
7838360	7840360	I think what we'll do, we'll finish up this chapter
7840360	7843360	and I'll just, I'll redirect into their ASMR video
7843360	7844360	because it's so cute.
7850360	7851360	So that's what she said.
7851360	7854360	So that's what she received,
7854360	7857360	but we have evidence that we're working.
7864360	7866360	How could she be working
7866360	7870360	and she's been given medical leave?
7872360	7873360	No.
7873360	7875360	Has worked in multiple jobs during the week.
7875360	7876360	Right.
7876360	7880360	Well, unless she's committing frauds.
7881360	7884360	She may have had an injury, but she's working.
7884360	7887360	So, so she was working a lot.
7887360	7890360	Does that account for ability of committing the bomb?
7890360	7891360	I'm not sure.
7891360	7893360	I'm not sure either.
7893360	7895360	Is there something else here?
7895360	7896360	Sure.
7896360	7898360	It's still the leg injury.
7898360	7900360	She may have an oopsie again.
7900360	7901360	Oopsie, oopsie, oopsie.
7901360	7903360	That info came in handy though.
7903360	7905360	That info came in handy though.
7905360	7907360	That info came in handy though.
7907360	7909360	That info came in handy though.
7909360	7911360	That info came in handy though.
7916360	7917360	Initiate.
7917360	7918360	Initiate.
7918360	7920360	Wait, he's talking to her now?
7927360	7929360	Not in the mood for knock knock jokes.
7929360	7931360	Oh, you blew it.
7931360	7933360	Oh, cut the crap.
7933360	7935360	Who are you?
7935360	7937360	So now you can't ask.
7940360	7944360	Initiate is the name in contact with Initiate.
7944360	7948360	I'm gonna go beat my dad up and tell him to shut the fuck up on the phone.
7948360	7950360	I quote the other side of this.
7950360	7952360	Then initiate again.
7952360	7955360	I wonder what his or her role is.
7955360	7957360	Well, let's find out.
7957360	7960360	Initiate has been in contact with two of our target persons so far.
7960360	7961360	There should be enough.
7961360	7962360	And here we go.
7962360	7964360	Feel free to investigate this hacker well,
7964360	7966360	but keep the focus on the whammin'.
7966360	7968360	So she's blocked him.
7970360	7971360	Oh, not again.
7971360	7972360	You're from Singular, right?
7972360	7974360	Don't care how you got my number.
7974360	7976360	Oh, no, that's the one from Session Closed.
7977360	7980360	Oh, he started up again even though she blocked him?
7980360	7981360	Yelling your name again?
7981360	7983360	Oh, he freaking talks to my mum.
7983360	7985360	And he's like legal name, legal name, legal name.
7985360	7987360	And I'm like, well, buzz the duck off.
7988360	7993360	You should listen to me just for a moment, all right?
7993360	7994360	And then it's all gone.
7994360	7996360	I don't care what you have to say.
7998360	8000360	See, I know about your little band of troublemakers,
8000360	8002360	and I really dig it.
8006360	8007360	The government,
8007360	8009360	sorry, I'm gonna make myself a wee bit weird,
8009360	8010360	so I'm not in the way.
8013360	8015360	The government needs to know that.
8016360	8018360	The government needs to kick where the sun don't shine.
8018360	8020360	So he's anti-government.
8020360	8021360	Okay, yeah.
8021360	8023360	That's all right with me, sweetie.
8023360	8025360	But bombing people, that's plain wrong.
8025360	8026360	What?
8026360	8028360	How come you think it was one of us?
8028360	8030360	Let's just say I've been watching you all for some time.
8030360	8034360	The bomb bar hit places where your outlawed posse
8034360	8037360	have been no way you did not hear about that.
8037360	8040360	You are extremely lucky that the cops were stupid enough
8040360	8043360	not to have figured that connection yet.
8043360	8046360	Else they might have prevented the mall thingy.
8046360	8049360	Me, who could have maybe done the mall thing.
8052360	8054360	Oh, he misses her here.
8054360	8055360	How do you threaten me?
8055360	8056360	I got none.
8056360	8057360	So give me two reasons.
8057360	8058360	You know, like,
8058360	8060360	put your conscience of mine at ease if you want to.
8060360	8061360	Yolanda, be cool.
8061360	8063360	I said I want to help after all,
8063360	8064360	not threaten you.
8064360	8065360	Her name's Yolanda.
8065360	8067360	No, her name's not Yolanda.
8067360	8069360	I'll show you how you do it.
8069360	8071360	I'm gonna hack that precious page.
8073360	8075360	And upload something special.
8075360	8077360	It's gonna be easy with those...
8077360	8078360	He dares?
8078360	8079360	Wow.
8079360	8082360	The it guys are gonna make short work of that rookie.
8084360	8086360	Don't care about your shit.
8086360	8087360	Wait, wait, wait.
8089360	8091360	Sorry, my dad's talking.
8091360	8092360	We'll have to mute once like...
8092360	8093360	Oh wait, we'll do this bit
8093360	8096360	and then I'm gonna fucking go spank him.
8096360	8097360	Wait, wait, give me a second.
8097360	8098360	Will I get to work?
8098360	8099360	Don't go, wait.
8099360	8100360	If I could get away from you, I could.
8100360	8102360	I can't switch my phone off now.
8102360	8103360	That is a nice looking firewall.
8103360	8105360	You have their dear party web team.
8105360	8108360	It would be a shame if someone would just bypass it.
8108360	8110360	Can you actually shut up?
8113360	8114360	We can't even hear him.
8114360	8116360	I know, but I'm just worried he like fucking...
8116360	8117360	You know when like, fuck around the phone
8117360	8119360	and they wander up and down the hallway.
8119360	8120360	I'm scared of him doing that.
8120360	8122360	I'm being right outside the door.
8122360	8124360	Doing this still gives me chills
8124360	8125360	and needs to distract myself.
8125360	8126360	Sheesh, almost done.
8126360	8128360	Just a second longer.
8132360	8133360	What the heck?
8135360	8137360	Oh, shit, man.
8140360	8143360	They reinforce their huge gaping look.
8143360	8144360	Oh, it just vanished.
8144360	8146360	It's almost like somebody warned them.
8147360	8148360	Yeah, whatever.
8148360	8149360	Goodbye, initiative.
8150360	8152360	It's initiate and wait.
8156360	8158360	I'm gonna spam you for the rest of your day
8158360	8160360	if you don't answer my question.
8161360	8163360	It's funny you're watching us when we shower.
8163360	8164360	You want me to?
8164360	8166360	Or do you want me to admit to it?
8167360	8169360	Well, hell, will you leave me alone
8169360	8171360	and quit poking around my life?
8171360	8172360	You said you were not involved in this.
8172360	8173360	Oh, I'm not.
8173360	8174360	Okay, okay.
8174360	8176360	Do you think it's someone else?
8176360	8177360	Thought.
8177360	8179360	The band of misfits? Nah.
8183360	8184360	Harrison is the only guy
8184360	8187360	I could remotely imagine doing anything like that.
8187360	8188360	Okay, no.
8191360	8194360	Harrison had an interest in...
8194360	8196360	Hmm, does she know more than we do
8196360	8198360	or is it a random question?
8198360	8200360	Harrison had an interest in Cassandra
8200360	8203360	because she's got big money.
8203360	8204360	Sure.
8205360	8206360	Submit that.
8209360	8211360	Must be crushing when your friends
8211360	8213360	only like you for Yamoola.
8213360	8216360	Juliet was a bit shy, but good at organizing.
8216360	8217360	So...
8219360	8222360	You know what I think is the gov themselves?
8222360	8225360	I love a good self-insert plot.
8225360	8227360	Sorry, but I'm putting that down.
8227360	8228360	I thought about that.
8228360	8230360	Did you know that...
8230360	8231360	What a joke.
8231360	8233360	Of course the government
8233360	8235360	to justify surveillance, right?
8235360	8236360	I've heard that million times right now.
8236360	8237360	Every time something happens
8237360	8239360	there's nothing to these conspiracies.
8240360	8241360	Did you know that since the
8241360	8243360	electronic must have unique IDs
8243360	8244360	they look like this
8244360	8246360	and it's not even secure?
8248360	8250360	Well, that's because it is what?
8250360	8251360	Don't worry, I've only...
8251360	8252360	Oh, very good.
8252360	8253360	You've found a device.
8253360	8255360	Every device in the nation has one in the court
8255360	8257360	but that's literally what they're talking about.
8257360	8260360	We can use the insider tool to connect
8260360	8262360	to see what the user has on the device.
8262360	8264360	The device must be running it online.
8264360	8266360	Don't worry, I only access the number remotely.
8266360	8268360	Nothing more you deserve.
8268360	8270360	First, you threaten me.
8270360	8271360	Now this will do.
8271360	8273360	Initiate recognizes this will help.
8274360	8275360	His help is not one...
8275360	8278360	Yeah, if only you would session close.
8279360	8281360	I can see her desktop.
8282360	8284360	What's in the trash?
8284360	8286360	Request for carving jobs.
8286360	8287360	Okay, so I was right.
8287360	8288360	She was doing the jobs.
8289360	8290360	That's fine.
8290360	8293360	Let me just check all the things in the trash.
8294360	8296360	Take over the freedom shift.
8298360	8299360	Oh.
8299360	8301360	Okay, so no matter how much privacy
8301360	8303360	you've got, the government already knows.
8305360	8306360	Put your tinfoil hat on
8306360	8308360	and let's just call ourselves crazy.
8309360	8311360	My phone number is a strip.
8313360	8315360	We've got a phone number as well.
8317360	8318360	Got everything on her.
8318360	8319360	Wait, hold on.
8319360	8321360	Desktop, private.
8321360	8323360	An apology and an offer.
8326360	8327360	Oh, okay, okay.
8327360	8328360	Abraham email.
8328360	8329360	I'll take it.
8329360	8330360	I'll take it.
8330360	8332360	Okay, I'll take an email.
8332360	8333360	I just realized,
8333360	8335360	have I got green artifact in around me?
8336360	8337360	No.
8339360	8340360	I think I'm fine.
8340360	8341360	Sorry.
8341360	8343360	When I record, I have to do...
8343360	8344360	When I record for like shorts, I have to do...
8344360	8346360	Sorry, that was like jump scare
8346360	8347360	just out of nowhere.
8349360	8351360	When I record shorts,
8351360	8353360	I have to do a transparent layer
8353360	8355360	and I thought I had it there,
8355360	8356360	but it's just because I'm so zoomed.
8356360	8357360	Oh, sorry.
8357360	8359360	I forget that I'm not supposed to show that part.
8361360	8362360	Okay, here we go.
8366360	8368360	Is your hair bun wearing the tinfoil hat?
8368360	8369360	Exactly.
8369360	8371360	Look, it fits perfectly.
8373360	8374360	I suggest that we talk.
8374360	8378360	Received an offer of assistance by Abraham.
8378360	8380360	It's in contact with each other.
8380360	8381360	Okay.
8381360	8383360	We'll keep that.
8385360	8387360	Assist each other with what exactly?
8387360	8388360	Do not read.
8389360	8391360	I'll embarrass a male.
8393360	8395360	Pass the part of a relationship?
8395360	8396360	She's interrel-
8396360	8397360	So I might as well write down
8397360	8398360	what I've been trying to say in time.
8398360	8399360	I love you.
8399360	8401360	Oh, wait, what?
8401360	8404360	Every cell in me wants to just backspace
8404360	8406360	or not send a...
8406360	8410360	Oh, she's in love with him.
8410360	8411360	And not just the son,
8411360	8413360	even though her backpack tripled on him.
8413360	8414360	Okay, so she's in love,
8414360	8416360	but he didn't reciprocate
8416360	8419360	and she spawned a wane because of it.
8419360	8420360	Like her a-
8420360	8422360	So she isn't single after all?
8422360	8424360	She pretends to be?
8426360	8428360	That's her with a wane.
8430360	8431360	Desmo?
8431360	8432360	Yeah, you like that.
8432360	8433360	Yeah, you like that.
8433360	8434360	Don't you?
8436360	8437360	Girl, I like your face.
8437360	8438360	Come again.
8438360	8440360	Kids being the center of my life.
8443360	8445360	Squad?
8445360	8446360	What?
8446360	8448360	She's an army veteran?
8448360	8451360	Whoa, but look, the symbol on her tank.
8451360	8452360	The symbol on her tank
8452360	8454360	is what she used on the website.
8456360	8457360	Oh my God.
8457360	8459360	As an ex-soldier?
8459360	8461360	We need to specify
8461360	8462360	specifically know
8462360	8465360	what kind of experience she has.
8465360	8467360	That's cute.
8468360	8470360	Headlines, what's going on?
8470360	8472360	Headlines, isn't it?
8472360	8473360	Harrison's timeline?
8473360	8475360	It's on you here?
8482360	8484360	That's why you kept it quiet for so long.
8484360	8486360	What the hell, the big revolution cell
8486360	8488360	is a lack of peer-to-peer.
8488360	8489360	I feel you.
8489360	8491360	When the TNB called on me
8491360	8492360	and asked if I would write for them,
8492360	8494360	I laughed in 30 minutes.
8495360	8497360	But they called me again to let me know
8497360	8498360	I could write whatever I want.
8498360	8499360	No strings to hell.
8499360	8500360	I can even swear, and I do.
8501360	8503360	Well, good luck with an article like that.
8503360	8505360	You could not be any further away.
8509360	8511360	Hmm, so he actually
8511360	8513360	posted it proudly.
8513360	8515360	I'm getting so confused with him.
8517360	8519360	Fuckin' hell, that was her.
8519360	8520360	What the?
8522360	8524360	Is that guy from Fende?
8524360	8525360	He's from Guerrilla.
8525360	8527360	Nice, it sits there.
8527360	8528360	Okay.
8529360	8531360	Well, it's very important to know
8531360	8533360	we're dealing with a combat veteran.
8534360	8536360	She's specialised in a few things.
8542360	8544360	Combat engineer,
8544360	8546360	bravery medal,
8546360	8549360	dishonourable discharge
8549360	8551360	and three months of confinement
8551360	8553360	for being AWOL
8553360	8555360	with voluntary return.
8556360	8558360	That's something to note down.
8560360	8562360	Absence without official leave.
8562360	8563360	That's a severe punishment.
8563360	8564360	Oh, is it?
8564360	8565360	Because she fell in love with him
8565360	8567360	and went backpacking with him?
8567360	8568360	I think so.
8568360	8570360	Did you know this puts her on the same level
8570360	8572360	as any previous convicted felon?
8572360	8573360	Well...
8575360	8577360	The nation.
8577360	8578360	Harriers.
8581360	8583360	Mission kebabs.
8583360	8585360	Sorry, it does not say that at all.
8586360	8589360	I'll just check out all the missions
8589360	8591360	and cases,
8591360	8593360	something in it,
8593360	8595360	and it doesn't really look like that.
8597360	8599360	Engineer, she might know how to pop her.
8599360	8601360	Oh, actually, yeah, you're right.
8601360	8602360	I should write that down.
8602360	8604360	Write that down, write that down!
8604360	8606360	Okay, so there's nothing.
8607360	8608360	Okay.
8608360	8609360	Let's do the news.
8609360	8611360	Wait, no, let's do her.
8613360	8615360	Of course, I can't even find it now.
8615360	8616360	Memorial.
8616360	8618360	Oh, this is sad.
8627360	8630360	Her boyfriend passed away.
8632360	8635360	That explains why she's a single mother.
8637360	8639360	Initiated by the government,
8639360	8640360	as much as I hate to say it,
8640360	8642360	it definitely provides motivation to hate it.
8642360	8644360	Find more to back that up.
8644360	8646360	Aw, that's really sad.
8648360	8650360	Oh dear, oh dear, oh dear.
8650360	8654360	Right, let's report that you are a combat engineer.
8654360	8656360	Same year as her discharge.
8656360	8658360	Okay, so...
8659360	8661360	Well, you know that she got the bravery.
8661360	8662360	Ward, at least.
8662360	8664360	And if he says it's a waste of time,
8664360	8665360	he can pop his clogs.
8665360	8667360	Seems to have come a long way
8667360	8669360	from being such an honorable person.
8669360	8672360	There's something on the missions that I missed.
8677360	8680360	I've missed something on this page, apparently.
8680360	8682360	I don't see it.
8684360	8686360	I don't see it.
8686360	8687360	It's here.
8687360	8688360	What one is it?
8688360	8692360	I'm scrolling, asking for the game to do it for me.
8692360	8694360	Oh, there we go.
8695360	8699360	Task with infrastructural maintenance during a thingy,
8699360	8702360	but it's conflicting with something later.
8703360	8706360	Why does this keep being highlighted?
8706360	8708360	Previous entry.
8711360	8713360	That's why she's ill.
8713360	8715360	Like, she's got issues,
8715360	8717360	because she's...
8717360	8719360	Patient reports a permanent unrest
8719360	8721360	that's suffering from...
8721360	8724360	Patient tends to react aggressive when challenged.
8724360	8726360	She has PTSD.
8728360	8729360	Oh, right.
8729360	8731360	Report the PTSD, because that's dangerous.
8731360	8734360	PTSD is unbelievably dangerous.
8734360	8736360	That sounds menacing and important,
8736360	8738360	but I wonder what might have caused it.
8738360	8741360	Well, she's a veteran.
8741360	8742360	She's seen war?
8742360	8743360	Hello?
8743360	8744360	Are you serious?
8744360	8746360	I wonder what caused it.
8746360	8748360	Oh, look at that.
8749360	8753360	So, how do we find what was conflicting in French, you know?
8757360	8759360	I don't know what conflicting...
8759360	8761360	I love how the music changes every time something shocking
8761360	8763360	and important happens at school,
8763360	8764360	not shell-shaped.
8764360	8767360	And I probably heard her boyfriend perish in front of her.
8767360	8769360	Mmm.
8769360	8771360	She's covered wars, you know.
8771360	8773360	Exactly.
8773360	8776360	I can't find this...
8776360	8779360	other thing that conflicts with this.
8781360	8782360	Hmm.
8782360	8784360	I'm missing something.
8784360	8785360	I'm missing a lot of things.
8785360	8787360	So, the mission's got the conflicting thing.
8787360	8789360	So, what's in here?
8791360	8793360	Yeah, it's up 5 to 12 times an hour,
8793360	8795360	but does not feel overly tired.
8795360	8798360	I mean, I'll just assume a lot of things.
8799360	8802360	There's something I'm missing.
8805360	8807360	Is there something I'm missing?
8807360	8809360	I think I'm missing something.
8811360	8813360	Ugh, nonsense.
8816360	8818360	Is there anything else on this piece here?
8820360	8821360	Oh, wait.
8821360	8823360	I don't know what this is.
8823360	8825360	System.
8825360	8826360	Oh.
8826360	8828360	CCTV.
8828360	8830360	She looked up CCTV.
8830360	8832360	Hmm.
8832360	8834360	If we had a video...
8834360	8836360	of Strone dying,
8836360	8838360	we would have cried till the end of the stream.
8839360	8842360	I watched Azura finish a...
8842360	8844360	stray,
8844360	8846360	and like her voice sounded quite sad.
8846360	8848360	Me, who like burst out in her tears,
8848360	8850360	like, ohhhh!
8852360	8854360	I really am the crybaby.
8854360	8857360	I was like, oh, this is the saddest thing I've ever played.
8857360	8858360	Ohhhh!
8858360	8859360	Like, greeting Miza.
8859360	8861360	And Azura's just like, yeah.
8861360	8862360	Oh, that's sad.
8862360	8864360	Yeah, Azura's way stronger.
8864360	8866360	That's another thing to start from.
8866360	8867360	You have something sinister in mind.
8867360	8869360	Not to be confused with the...
8869360	8871360	the head beach of our sin sister.
8873360	8875360	Yeah, we want something sinister.
8875360	8877360	It's vaguely associated, you know,
8877360	8879360	with the soul.
8879360	8881360	This makes two locations.
8881360	8882360	We will have a very solid case,
8882360	8884360	so if we can make a third...
8886360	8888360	singular thing, you're in.
8892360	8893360	Momè.
8893360	8895360	Yeah, we can move on.
8898360	8901360	Okay, I don't think there was anything else we could extract out of this stuff.
8904360	8905360	Right.
8905360	8907360	There's something con...
8907360	8909360	there's something...
8909360	8911360	projects.
8912360	8914360	It has become mandatory to inform employees
8914360	8917360	whenever an applicant applies an ex-convict.
8917360	8920360	Safety Bill prevents Nina from getting a job.
8922360	8923360	Huh.
8926360	8929360	So as you're considering she's on her own taking care of her son,
8929360	8931360	it makes one hell of a motivation together
8931360	8934360	with the fact Desmond was killed on a mission.
8934360	8936360	Congrats, every name's Desmond!
8936360	8938360	By the government.
8939360	8942360	We have found a strong motivation revenge.
8943360	8946360	But we haven't found the conflicting piece of information
8946360	8948360	with this one here!
8948360	8949360	Please!
8950360	8952360	What's the conflict?
8953360	8955360	I can't find it.
8955360	8956360	No.
8956360	8958360	Task with infrastructure maintenance.
8960360	8961360	Hmm.
8961360	8963360	It's an on-tri-PC.
8969360	8971360	Where's it on your PC?
8976360	8978360	Do not read infrastructure.
8979360	8981360	Do not read...
8981360	8985360	There's not going to be any active emails in it, is there?
8986360	8988360	An earlier blog post.
8988360	8990360	Let's have a little...
8990360	8992360	scramble through this.
8994360	8995360	Hmm.
8996360	8998360	What can I access?
8998360	9000360	Everything's archived on one page.
9001360	9002360	Bye.
9006360	9010360	I'm just checking if there's anything new that is...
9010360	9012360	reachable.
9013360	9015360	That doesn't really seem like it.
9015360	9017360	Wait, what's the date in the letter?
9017360	9019360	I'm pretty sure she wrote that after he died.
9019360	9021360	It's probably...
9021360	9023360	grief written letter.
9024360	9026360	There's a lot of grief.
9028360	9032360	Desmond Miles from the hit video game Assassin's Creed franchise?
9035360	9036360	Hmm.
9036360	9038360	I'm being pepega.
9038360	9040360	I don't know what it is.
9043360	9046360	I was checking out the jobs she could get.
9046360	9048360	8 bucks an hour, that's rubbish.
9049360	9052360	I don't want to do all the profile dumbass.
9052360	9055360	Maintenance, works in cleaning maintenance.
9055360	9057360	She can repair stuff.
9057360	9059360	See recent employee feedback.
9059360	9061360	We already submit for this.
9061360	9063360	Hmm.
9063360	9065360	I'm shy to this game.
9067360	9070360	I don't know if I should just submit the one I can find,
9070360	9072360	because I can't seem to find the other one.
9073360	9075360	No.
9075360	9079360	These are like such arbitrary...
9079360	9081360	notes.
9081360	9083360	I'm definitely...
9083360	9085360	I'll just submit the job one.
9085360	9086360	Why not?
9086360	9087360	Right there, boom.
9087360	9089360	You do all that.
9089360	9091360	Upload complete.
9091360	9093360	Okay, she's a handy handy gal.
9093360	9094360	I'm not sure.
9094360	9096360	You can work tons of nights and stuff.
9096360	9098360	I don't know.
9098360	9100360	Look at us working on the weekend.
9100360	9101360	I get it.
9101360	9103360	It's different, of course, when you're single, mother.
9103360	9104360	That must be tough.
9104360	9106360	Do you have any idea why she's doing this?
9106360	9108360	What she aims for?
9108360	9110360	Sun, sun, high table.
9110360	9113360	Something, something, high table.
9113360	9116360	Oh, so you can use it.
9116360	9118360	I am very E.P.
9118360	9121360	I am God's E.P.S. soldier for today.
9121360	9123360	For once, it's not AC is the E.P.S. soldier.
9123360	9125360	Did AC end up streaming?
9125360	9127360	I knew she had a migraine.
9127360	9129360	I don't know if she ended up finishing up.
9131360	9132360	No, right.
9132360	9133360	I'm doing it.
9133360	9134360	I'm sending it.
9134360	9136360	I can't seem to find wherever the conflict and information is,
9136360	9138360	so I'm just sending it.
9140360	9142360	So nothing noteworthy here.
9142360	9144360	We know, we know, know enough,
9144360	9146360	of our background.
9150360	9151360	Was it another mission?
9151360	9153360	It was probably another mission.
9153360	9154360	A3.
9157360	9159360	AC can't migraine to buddy.
9159360	9160360	Yeah.
9163360	9164360	Yes.
9164360	9165360	Hey again, self here.
9165360	9166360	How's it going?
9166360	9167360	You feeling better?
9167360	9168360	Yeah, somewhat.
9168360	9171360	Finally, after spending the whole last week in bed.
9175360	9177360	Oh God, I can bring Michael around though.
9177360	9178360	Do you want?
9178360	9179360	No, thanks.
9179360	9180360	I'm going to pick him up in an hour.
9180360	9181360	Would that be okay?
9181360	9182360	Yeah, of course.
9182360	9184360	I promise to go to the playground with him.
9184360	9185360	That's fine.
9185360	9188360	I'll pick Michael up from the corner at Orchard Drive.
9189360	9190360	A location?
9190360	9193360	Oh, we've got a location if we need to arrest her.
9197360	9199360	No!
9200360	9202360	That's such a good donor.
9204360	9206360	No, that's such a good donor.
9206360	9208360	Thank you, the disco opinion.
9208360	9210360	Option, sorry, not opinion.
9210360	9212360	The disco opinion.
9212360	9213360	Option, fuck.
9213360	9214360	The disco option.
9214360	9216360	Thank you for the tip.
9216360	9217360	Sorry, I'm out.
9217360	9218360	Super chat shit.
9218360	9219360	I'm fucking losing it.
9219360	9222360	Okay, that might play a role there.
9222360	9224360	That was such a good donor.
9225360	9228360	Right, we've got spending in bed last week.
9228360	9230360	I feel that's conflicting.
9231360	9233360	We would like to inform you about new rate
9233360	9236360	in McDougal Groundkeeping Services.
9236360	9237360	Yippee!
9243360	9246360	She was apparently there at the mall.
9249360	9252360	So she worked at the site and even at the right time.
9252360	9255360	She's worked at the right time at the other location.
9255360	9258360	We have now been able to associate her with every location.
9258360	9260360	Her whereabouts are hereby clarified.
9260360	9262360	Things are not looking good for her.
9263360	9264360	That's it.
9264360	9265360	You've found all we need to know.
9265360	9266360	Let's see.
9266360	9268360	Myth, matter, nova.
9268360	9271360	Simply engaged in maintenance tasks in the military.
9271360	9273360	That doesn't seem notable.
9273360	9275360	There's evidence that she has strong relations
9275360	9277360	to hate the safety bill.
9277360	9280360	And finally, we can associate her with every single
9280360	9282360	bomb location to prove that she was present.
9282360	9284360	Seems we've found her prime suspect.
9284360	9285360	This is ground for arrest.
9285360	9287360	I will need a moment to talk to my superiors.
9287360	9288360	I'll get back soon.
9288360	9290360	Keep observing, however.
9290360	9293360	There's something here I've missed.
9293360	9294360	But I don't.
9294360	9295360	Oh, what's she doing?
9295360	9296360	Yeah, I've got a PC.
9296360	9297360	What are you doing?
9299360	9300360	What are you doing?
9300360	9301360	What are you trying to hide?
9302360	9303360	What's your search history?
9304360	9306360	What's your search history?
9306360	9307360	No.
9307360	9309360	Oh, sugar.
9311360	9314360	She's talking to her synodona.
9314360	9315360	Hey, Harry.
9315360	9316360	Are you there?
9320360	9322360	Oh, please.
9322360	9324360	Is my name Ebenezer Scrooge?
9324360	9326360	Why do all the ghosts in Christmas Pass
9326360	9327360	come back and haunt me?
9327360	9328360	Harry, I don't have time for this.
9328360	9329360	I have a problem here.
9329360	9331360	I need your tech knowledge for.
9332360	9335360	Why doesn't anyone ever ask me about my problems?
9335360	9336360	Oh, right.
9336360	9337360	Why is it?
9339360	9340360	I just came home.
9344360	9345360	Da, da, da.
9345360	9348360	And I had left my PC switched on this morning
9348360	9350360	and I just tried to look something up online
9350360	9352360	and suddenly it went all hair wire.
9352360	9354360	And my security app popped up with like a million
9354360	9356360	warnings from some intrusion.
9356360	9357360	So I pulled the plug.
9357360	9358360	Oh, no.
9359360	9361360	Sounds like you already fixed the problem then.
9366360	9369360	The thing is, I got contacted by a very strange guy earlier.
9369360	9370360	I think he was some kind of hacker.
9370360	9372360	And now he's hacking my PC.
9373360	9375360	Geez, this guy is a new aunt.
9375360	9376360	New aunt.
9376360	9377360	New...
9377360	9378360	New...
9378360	9379360	New sense.
9379360	9380360	New sense.
9380360	9381360	Oh, my God.
9381360	9383360	I think that guy already broken to my bank account as well.
9383360	9384360	Oh, no.
9384360	9385360	It's us.
9385360	9386360	We're the baddie.
9389360	9390360	I wonder who does it.
9390360	9392360	I was contacted by that guy as well.
9392360	9394360	He was blabbering about everything that we'd done in the past.
9394360	9396360	And he would give our stuff away to the cops as usual.
9397360	9398360	He told you that as well.
9398360	9399360	What did you do?
9399360	9400360	I told him that.
9400360	9401360	F off.
9401360	9402360	Who do you take me for?
9403360	9405360	Do you think he really has something?
9405360	9407360	I need to be sure he doesn't have a thing.
9410360	9412360	Even if that guy had something,
9412360	9414360	have you gotten your hands dirty?
9414360	9415360	What's the fuzz about?
9416360	9417360	What's the fuzz about?
9417360	9418360	Who even says that?
9418360	9420360	I need to get out of here before the cops are here.
9420360	9421360	Whoo!
9424360	9429360	Uh, she's what?
9429360	9431360	We cannot let her main suspect.
9431360	9434360	I will assemble an intervention team immediately.
9434360	9435360	We'll start creating mobile.
9435360	9438360	I'll form the intervention team that they should move in aggressively.
9438360	9440360	As you find out, she might react violently.
9440360	9442360	Since her PZ has gone offline,
9442360	9444360	we should start at her home.
9444360	9445360	Thankfully, we're already in our dress.
9445360	9447360	Go through her communications.
9447360	9449360	Maybe she will hint at places she's going that ain't home.
9449360	9451360	Forward anything of importance to me.
9451360	9453360	It's in your hands now.
9453360	9454360	Don't mess this one up.
9454360	9456360	We can't afford it after the last incident.
9456360	9457360	Oh, come on.
9457360	9458360	This guy's faking.
9458360	9459360	Hello, is anyone there?
9459360	9460360	Figures.
9460360	9463360	Team Alpha Bravo Charlie, move, move, move.
9463360	9467360	Oh, she's in call to her sister?
9467360	9469360	Is she going to go to Juliet's?
9469360	9472360	Welcome to Tech U.
9472360	9473360	Oh, hey, Juliet.
9473360	9475360	Thank God you're working right now.
9475360	9477360	I called your mobile, but couldn't get hold of you.
9477360	9478360	Can we talk?
9478360	9481360	You know, I'm all alone here catching up on work.
9481360	9482360	Is everything okay?
9482360	9484360	Listen, I don't have much time.
9484360	9485360	Okay.
9485360	9487360	There is this psycho that's coming for me.
9487360	9488360	He's been stalking me.
9488360	9489360	Wait.
9489360	9492360	She thinks the psycho's coming for her?
9492360	9493360	I can't explain.
9493360	9494360	Will you help me?
9494360	9495360	Of course.
9495360	9496360	But how?
9496360	9500360	Do you know somewhere safe that my son and I can lay low for a while?
9500360	9502360	Wait, she thinks the psycho's coming after us.
9502360	9503360	Not us.
9503360	9505360	Wait, but did Nina do it?
9505360	9506360	I don't think Nina did it.
9506360	9507360	Come on.
9507360	9508360	You got to think.
9508360	9509360	Okay.
9509360	9510360	I think I know a place.
9510360	9511360	It's in the middle of nowhere.
9511360	9512360	She could be lying.
9512360	9513360	No, wait.
9513360	9514360	Don't say it.
9514360	9515360	I think he might be listening.
9515360	9516360	What?
9516360	9517360	How?
9517360	9518360	This guy is a hacker.
9518360	9523360	He's already gone through my computer and I'm pretty sure he's listening to my call.
9523360	9524360	She knows the call.
9524360	9525360	So are you kidding me?
9525360	9527360	I mean, like, listen right now.
9527360	9530360	Just don't say anything that will give my location away.
9530360	9531360	Okay.
9531360	9532360	Better safe than sorry.
9532360	9534360	Just help me get out of here.
9534360	9535360	Bit late for that now.
9535360	9537360	Now he knows where I work.
9537360	9538360	Sorry.
9538360	9539360	Okay.

9541360	9542360	Give me a sec.
9542360	9545360	Just going to pack some stuff.
9545360	9548360	Did Nina know where she was?
9548360	9552360	I'm bringing my gun.
9552360	9554360	Squad team, I repeat.
9554360	9556360	I repeat.

9557360	9558360	She's armed.
9558360	9559360	I didn't expect that.
9559360	9560360	I'll tell the intervention team.
9560360	9561360	Yeah.
9561360	9562360	Boogie is hot.

9564360	9565360	Your arm.
9565360	9566360	Yeah.
9566360	9568360	And if I don't get protection, I'm going to be dead anyway.
9568360	9569360	Someone's at the door.
9569360	9570360	She's at the back door.
9570360	9571360	Okay.

9576360	9577360	She went out of the back.
9577360	9578360	She went out of the back.
9578360	9579360	She's a flight.
9579360	9580360	Maybe she'll climb out the window.
9580360	9581360	Hold up.
9581360	9582360	Is everything all right?
9582360	9583360	Damn.

9652240	9669520	you check the mail please who's right and who's right and what do you mean
9669520	9674680	who's right and what's now
9678840	9683760	Abraham Nina I'm truly sorry the investors but to be frank you overstepped
9683760	9687200	the boundaries of the bombs were meant as a warning for those who are different
9687200	9694560	oh she's perished a beacon they were not meant to kill oh my god I can't believe
9694560	9698200	you just went to sit can you they work together but why I still don't get it
9698200	9702760	this changes everything we must find Abraham tomorrow before we'll need the
9702760	9707800	rest it's been one hell of a day they were not meant to kill I mean even if
9707800	9713120	they were not meant to kill so fucking crap you joking me that women lost our
9713120	9720040	life and it was you do you honestly believe that after all you've seen oh the
9720040	9725360	bombs were meant as a warning they were not once again you disappoint me with
9725360	9735400	your instrumentable hatred and rage consider our agreement boy what oh my
9735560	9748840	gosh complete episode 3 that was insane he set her up actually
9749680	9755720	oh my god episode 4 memory hole
9757720	9763480	oh back again well yes my job and it clocking for my shift I still can't
9763480	9767520	believe what happened we got the perpetrator the bomber everything looks
9767520	9772800	that way but at what cost I mean did we do the right thing flag and miss as
9772800	9778280	dangerous did we kill her in the end I wish you could talk to me at least this
9778280	9782560	one time speaking into this one-way channel feels like barking at a wall
9782560	9789920	endlessly worst of all as you found out Abraham seems to have incited and planned
9789920	9795120	the assaults we need to get him today there must be some lead on him we have
9795120	9800720	overlooked we'll keep observing all others in case we learn of something new
9800720	9809440	okay let's see what the headlines are a legend perpetrator is dead
9812960	9817120	listen I don't like the reports either we need to cover the fact that this
9817120	9821400	happened somewhere else we cannot frighten people sometimes their truth
9821400	9831160	and ours have to divert for the common good oh they're framing on her yeah
9831160	9838880	Donald's weekend Harrison this is oh my god her sister just perished isn't this
9838880	9846040	your office number I appreciate I'm once again important Harrison Nina is dead
9846080	9850480	quit bullshit me not funny take a look at the TNV if you don't believe me my
9850480	9860080	god what she's been associated with the bomb and I can't believe it Nina you
9860080	9865920	stupid piece of what in the hell there's more I spoke to her yesterday she
9865920	9870160	called me I've never heard her so scared she said she was being tracked by
9870160	9876720	someone and needed to skip town sorry I need to hydrate she just wanted to let
9876720	9879480	me know what was going on in case anything happened to her then packed a
9879480	9883600	few things went on her way she did message me about someone tracking her
9883600	9887920	as well though it was this hacker who screwed with her page what did she tell
9887920	9891800	you she suspected someone to be wiretapping her calls she wasn't
9891800	9894920	exactly willing to talk about it I don't know for sure but I think it could
9894920	9899840	have been the police oh this is brilliant how long until they discover the
9899840	9904480	connection to us they might be listening to this very call as we speak about
9904480	9909880	Nina why would they we didn't do anything or did you know but it's
9909880	9913640	becoming blatantly obvious those governments are trying to set us up the
9913640	9920840	bombs were exactly where we held our protest then those letters with em
9920840	9927880	believes the government wants to set it up that's the second time and now you
9927880	9931280	tell me you've been in contact with Nina yesterday seems to be that they must be
9931280	9935120	setting us up because we didn't do anything for sure I almost understand it
9935120	9941960	almost the fourth wall speaking up against them too many times I don't know
9941960	9949720	hmm we should seek help just in case help who's gonna help us Joseph Langley the
9949720	9955720	lawyer yeah the boyfriend a lawyer what do you want him to do bus law
9955720	9960960	enforcement the government he understands our situation Abe also knew Joseph I
9960960	9970800	thought I didn't know that they knew each other hmm brah really Joe's they make the
9970800	9973800	law they break the law they know each other very well this could be a new
9973800	9979960	lead I will request Joseph yeah another person because we're so convinced we're
9979960	9985280	doing the right thing huh we have cleared to proceed we are going to need to know
9985280	9990840	some basics on who Joseph Langley is remember to check old sources other than
9990840	9996400	that focus on hints of Abraham he's the center oh god I can't read that fast he
9996400	10001440	understands it really they make the law so yeah take it you got a better plan we
10001480	10005400	need to get people on our side turn things around Abraham knew that yeah
10005400	10009080	you're right he did know that so now you've set on miraculously achieving
10009080	10012840	something the thought spent one and a half years this is not about the thought
10012840	10018040	this is about me defending myself well then what's your defense plan there is a
10018040	10024640	guy a guy goes by the name initiate might actually be a girl who cares look
10024640	10029440	the hack on this thought blog is very elaborate our site is super safe I'm not
10029440	10036040	an amateur that guy girl whatever is skilled and initially mentioned having
10036040	10040480	no sympathy for the government you're gonna trust a random hacker who targets
10040480	10044880	thought simply because he said he doesn't like the government why would he
10044880	10049160	first threaten us and they've worked with us just leave it to me Joe leave it
10049160	10055040	to me all right tails there you come leave it to me I'll persuade initiate
10055040	10058520	with ease imagine the possibilities with their own okay you know what have it
10058520	10063680	your way I'll have it main arguing like the good old days it's your might be more
10063680	10067440	secure than calling it brother how is that more secure you've just handed it
10067440	10074000	over to me okay there you go let's get going there goes my Sunday morning watch
10074000	10077760	yourself okay my mind is spinning what happened to Nina you watch yourself what
10077760	10085360	are you worried about me Jill's I don't know you so no bye sorry for that join
10085360	10089320	forces what he wise ass I know for a fact that you were messing around and
10089320	10097600	become a member of thought huh huh would you like to join us mr. hacker man I
10097600	10104800	wish my way I miss my wife I love that thing I thought mr. Donald left thought
10104800	10112560	now he seems like he's recruiting makes his exit seem unlikely so they put her
10112560	10118760	up as the bomba when confronted by the special forces and you know drew a
10118760	10123720	firearm fired the team returned to killing
10125040	10129880	well there's our lawyer we can start collecting stuff on him Sandra you so
10129880	10139240	by the way I'm going to see your contact in a very casual manner I like how
10139240	10148880	they didn't break up either multiple homicide when prompted to surrender the
10148880	10152480	suspect instead showed out aggressively while producing a firearm aiming at one
10152480	10157640	of the agents the suspect then opened fire wounding several agents on the
10157640	10162480	show oh wounding special agent on the shoulder and defense draws pistol and
10162480	10167080	returned fire as the situation briefing had already suggested to proceed with
10167080	10171560	caution the suspect was hit in the chest causing her to collapse an ambulance
10171560	10176520	was called but paramedics cannot resuscitate due to injuries in
10176520	10183760	kvatsa bowl with la ha ha always got a weak girlfriend
10187760	10191520	I have no idea for me is it all something about Paul against sentient
10191520	10214320	EI update on the party I don't know I don't know why this had an update thing
10215320	10223160	right headlines what we're not terrible this heavy rain oh no exclusive
10223160	10229800	interview with Jim founder Ronson oh yeah gotta get super right this is red so
10229800	10242600	I assume there's something in here maybe comes up later fast precise honest mm-hmm
10242600	10247040	sure let's read the car article I do love and though love reading a bit of
10247040	10253760	car okay there's a star there there's also star admissions still what did I
10253760	10261960	miss there's literally nothing I missed here
10261960	10267440	there's nothing I can click on the army page
10268400	10272680	so must be something weird cuz it insists there's like a piece of
10272680	10275680	information about Nina here but to be honest you can't have popped her clogs
10275680	10291920	so it's kind of over before it started maybe it comes up we already we got our
10291920	10302360	information that we needed it was all a dream and they woke up so if I close
10302360	10310880	these will that only show me the ones that might have something I feel like
10310880	10316520	okay yeah I was gonna say I feel like I've got like so many pages what's this
10316520	10326080	oh oh it's you oh that's right everyone said that you were a student well

10395640	10400560	going before she joined politics mr. Langley definitely has been around the
10400560	10406760	block I'm still I'm still so far so good on mr. Langley excluding the
10406760	10410440	connections to De La Croix everything's on the prison what we need to know right
10410440	10415600	now are his connections to Abraham and possibly the other members your broad
10415600	10423860	military service my Nina no I did I mean there's any combat experience look

10468540	10473420	that I was informed Cassandra's been taken in because apparently they have new
10473420	10476740	evidence regarding the attack on the officer I tried to call me Julie but
10476740	10480900	they claim she didn't want to talk to me that's their official statement where did
10480900	10487940	they suddenly dig up new evidence from you Juliet you're the problem I've
10487940	10494380	uploaded an audio yes already on patreon it was like a like a milestone
10494380	10499020	thank you and it's just me chugging colon water and burping use of the sadly
10499020	10503140	aligns perfectly with another incident you probably read the TNB today you
10503140	10512180	mean about the bomber yeah that woman that died Nina she was a friend she was
10512180	10515820	a friend and all I was just guess that she was there and a member of the group
10515820	10522740	called thought oh no I'm sorry I had no idea but reflands were women it's okay
10522740	10530620	you pause you can have known your rate this is very troubling I'm not getting
10530620	10535660	evil vibes from Yosef come to think about everyone asked me a favor and
10535660	10541740	called Nina sometime ago I hope that wasn't nice might well be I doubt Abe knew
10541740	10547340	about other folk name you know a favor for her this could be important follow

11855340	11860860	we must tread very carefully we will not speak so openly any longer I fear
11861420	11864860	seems it's a system that can put everything on the web under surveillance
11864860	11870540	what do you mean everything in this every way maybe pcs whatever your bs in
11870540	11875900	me I'm not man I'm not I wish I was

11882860	11884860	thing that I've been going through all of it
11884860	11889020	the outsource surveillance to people outside the nation
11889020	11895740	am I outside the nation oops those people are supposed to collect pieces of
11895740	11899020	data from websites all kinds of communication whatnot and send it to
11899020	11902540	Orwell it's safe to assume that nothing is safe anymore
11902540	11906380	wait so can I not report properly how come you never heard of it even more
11906380	11909820	importantly how come you have

11914140	11920380	the nation I don't know if I can report that or not
11920380	11927820	the new thing or two about secret I mean it's information
11929500	11933420	that spins what happened to Nina a real hacker now unfortunately we can't go
11933420	11939420	after people outside the nation so we don't even have the right to do it

12141900	12144780	my way now aren't you I have absolutely no idea who leaked this info

12149580	12156140	doesn't exactly a dozen investigation quite the office that we need to hurry
12160220	12163420	freedom is unfree

12192780	12196380	deliberately hard to get them to quietly when they're at the center of a
12196380	12198780	right haha so there may be something in connection between
12198780	12202380	Yosef and Nina after all if you can find one last
12202380	12206700	indication that this may be meant for Nina
12206700	12212300	be enough to get custody
12214380	12219500	and say there what's going on here feedback on your request
12219500	12223340	there then there's this reoccurring donation that's been going on I can
12223340	12227900	respect if you want to help out a friend or something
12227900	12231580	but we need a reply
12232780	12238140	the certificates issued outstanding ongoing
12240380	12246060	so tax evasion are helping out a pal what one is that
12246780	12250860	excuse me for sending like these are major issues to see apart from the
12250860	12253340	number of clients drop on steadily your expense
12253340	12257740	since the end when especially the credit card went up by a whopping
12257740	12260860	any idea the reason but you stopped at some point seriously
12260860	12264780	if all those expenses are a must well I would definitely agree with laying off
12264780	12269180	the person that's what I'm thinking it's a
12269180	12274380	not a real charity no there's no way he's sending money
12274380	12283100	to his pals not the certificate he's embezzling money
12284700	12291180	oh that's what the payments are for yes oh no
12292700	12297900	oops I thought it was going to be obvious it's embezzlement
12297900	12301900	wait isn't it embezzlement
12302860	12308220	your entanglement about the immediate termination of work regarding
12308220	12313020	ah he got laid off you mentioned you've been participating in suspicious groups
12313020	12317980	and activities that's funny I think I'll submit that the wrong way around

12323580	12328860	I'm too slow IQ okay hey hey hey seems the government just fired the
12328940	12332540	fresh shots our way seems so
12332540	12335340	I thought they might take longer to trace all back to thought I didn't expect
12335340	12337980	that it'd be openly right about it
12337980	12340460	hmm

12503740	12509180	maybe the veal or collab actually where we get to look at pretty girl sorry I
12509180	12511900	just had to look at the news yes it's actually a bit weird a pretty harsh yes
12511900	12516300	but I made an interesting discovery that I need to talk to your
12516300	12519500	colleague Harrison yes I was just chatting I set up a conference colleague
12519660	12523260	that would be great a lot of reading give me a moment
12523260	12527020	honestly I was like oh let's play this game wait a minute I need to read
12527020	12529740	oh lord

12546860	12550460	got a face that we're known wait it's like huh you take me what Nina mentioned
12550460	12553820	the cops are wiretapping her calls why not chat I think the call is much more
12553820	12557900	appropriate for legal councils raises less arbors and chats might be logged
12557900	12562060	we're just the average couple seeking advice right couple we need to do this
12562060	12564620	don't speak too openly don't mention wiretaps okay
12564620	12570300	I'm like this alright right group call
12571340	12574540	she's not tired anymore she's something else
12574540	12579500	hey Yosef seems like this is working hello I'm Harrison I presume yes and
12579500	12586300	you're the law guy he's a good girl let's meet
12586300	12589900	I just read about your group I guess this isn't exactly brightening things up
12589900	12593580	for you you could say that the rules here has big
12593580	12596860	faith in your skills Yosef here to elaborate on what you
12596860	12601180	found out yes okay so you all know the safety
12601660	12608860	yes yeah all in all it's an aggregation of paragraphs to get people
12608860	12614060	behind bars is much more easily and prior in lives as necessary
12614060	12617180	no they use it as a sorry excuse for spying on people all the time
12617180	12621020	intimidating them yes I understand what's particularly dangerous about it for
12621020	12624620	you is that individuals might be prosecuted by mere indication of
12624620	12628140	threats to the nation in specific situations it will be
12628140	12631900	more than enough to point at a word you said in a rage to consider
12631900	12635100	you dangerous that's enough to hold you in for some time
12635100	12639020	but what's even more problematic for you is the so-called
12639020	12644940	a transivity of indication the what you all form a group an activist group this
12644940	12647740	links you to one another now if there was sufficient
12647740	12651580	indication that say Abraham created thought to commit crimes
12651580	12654860	or even acts of terrorism well they have grounds to arrest you all
12654860	12658780	but we didn't do anything how is this just this is so
12658780	12662220	freaking outrageous they'll twist and turn their so-called evidence until they
12662220	12666940	get what they need you will need to be very very careful from no one
12666940	12671260	we can do something about this right we need explicit evidence showing
12671260	12675420	Abraham created this group to be peaceful prove it beyond any doubt
12675420	12678700	this is why I need to ask you about Abraham to find out his original
12678700	12682220	intentions well ask away the two of us were friends for a
12682220	12686220	while but I never got the feeling he told me a lot about what was going on in
12686220	12690940	his life he was reclusive indeed that's what he was like
12690940	12695980	except when he was around thought how was thought formed he found out about me
12695980	12700140	by discovering my blog said he wanted to start a debate club
12700140	12703420	I said fine we had a couple of lame meetings nothing much happened
12703420	12706700	a debate club then that would be good that could
12706700	12712380	hardly be regarded as a terrorist asset uh yes but Abe was obsessed with getting
12712380	12717660	his message out make people aware what the government was doing
12717660	12723740	right that's kind of a given right anti-government and you go
12723740	12731100	then we went with so it was Nina why and we know why and we know why don't we
12731100	12735340	he wanted to get out of the contract of illness but the government said no
12735420	12740540	so as we said Nina oh god stop stop telling me everything Jesus
12740540	12746300	right Nina thought of the protest so it was miss
12746300	12750860	November the mall yeah during the studies I met Abraham online by chance
12750860	12754460	he motivated me to take his course
12754460	12760300	hold on more vigilio right then jules took over with the planning for the two
12760300	12768140	protests okay you false intention the bad planning causes you
12768140	12773020	Nina me each and every one of us is guilty of deviating from the intention
12773020	12776380	jules you don't know what you're talking about it was Nina she neglected
12776380	12779980	Nina was pretty violent I'm gonna be honest like I kind of feel like Nina was
12779980	12785020	the violent one cause I think it was that one
12785100	12789420	sorry but Nina literally reached for a
12789420	12793260	a pew pew I'm not sure if I'm willing to believe this is really contradictory
12793260	12797500	to what Abraham wanted if so wait didn't he not bomb him on purpose
12797500	12801260	no he said they went too far if so why are we doing the same
12801260	12804140	okay he's gone we don't know where and we don't know how to reach him
12804140	12807420	sadly oh well I will need to get back to writing some emails
12807420	12809980	of course I understand jesus I'll get back to you I suppose it was going to
12809980	12813580	benefit you too well because Sandra is removed from custody yes goodbye

14162700	14166780	this will stop their day is about to come to an end i have a plan but for this to work we must
14166780	14172700	meet like we did the old ways when we had our meetings and cafe chestnut oh no that's actually in
14172700	14179980	the book the chestnut cafes in the book we will have a conference called 4 p.m because i'm well aware

14315580	14320300	down we will track him down i've gone through the information we have on the remaining suspects
14320300	14325820	regarding the impersonation of abraham we have received information from a reliable source that
14325820	14332060	odonal is probably the leader of thought odonal predicted the bomb but this alone makes him suss
14332060	14336780	we have no idea why odonal hid the post on the thought blog on his timeline we are yet to
14336780	14343340	clarify why odonal would frequent a bomb a drugstore often perhaps for the materials
14344060	14348940	why would odonal have two health insurances it's apparent that harrison odonal might as well

15733740	15739020	freaking leash great how does that worry you my control is limited and the government will get
15739020	15744540	the control back at some point but this isn't my primary concern what makes me nervous is why
15744540	15750140	would abraham have such extensive knowledge of orwell this whole thing reeks of an enormous trap
15751340	15756700	abled betray us no he wouldn't but you're right something very strange as a foot we should get
15756700	15762540	out right now and this is the point where it gets even worse i had a quick look at his file
15763420	15770540	you would not believe what it says he's dead abraham is dead yeah he died quite some time ago
15771100	15776620	what that's impossible i thought that when we he first disappeared but i put it to the back
15776620	15785020	of my mind what became of him dead no abraham how he was very sick answer oh so that was real
15785020	15790700	oh you old fool we couldn't tell us he gave nina the orders for the bomba after his demise
15791180	15798060	this means this means someone has been setting her up real bad and not only
15799500	15806540	her all of us who the f would do such a thing i'm not getting info on who or why
15807420	15816620	what a pity but it does prove my point wait what do you mean jules it was me i set you up what
15817500	15823500	jules you wait a sec i can't believe where this is going are you for real right now are you
15823500	15829420	are you telling me you told nina to place those bombas i did i'm not proud of it but i had to be
15829420	15835180	it had to be done what the heck why you and nina youtube ruined everything for abraham
15835180	15841420	and for thought so you decided that leaving me wasn't enough for revenge you had to bomb innocent
15841420	15847340	people and blame it on thought it was necessary only when things are at their darkest will people
15847340	15853900	listen take note and actually enact change he knew that i know it was extreme extreme extremist
15853900	15863820	murder i know believe me i know you are the reason i was in custody how could you do that to me
15864860	15868700	thought needed to be destroyed that was the whole point instead of seeking me out and
15869420	15874700	labelled you all target persons and investigated you all screwed up your lives people need to see
15874700	15880380	how messed up orwell is it's not protection it's invasive and manipulation doom for everyone
15880380	15885660	note if no one is innocent everyone is a suspect abe wanted to make the world stand up against
15885660	15890860	orwell he knew how dangerous project word that's why he worked on it he did what he worked on it
15891580	15896460	this confirms what i feared but i didn't want to believe it if so he could have gone to the
15896780	15901740	media and taken it all public couldn't he he was afraid he thought nothing would ever change
15901740	15910220	if he did can you blame him he told me everything and told only me damn oh funny i just realized
15910220	15914380	you're actually much better yet much worse activists than nina or me could have ever been
15914380	15921580	that's admirable in a strange mess up way you're nothing but a biatch julia a killer a liar
15921660	15927580	cassie i oh just shut up shut up just shut up shut up this is madness julia first cassie then
15927580	15933340	you pulled me into this all those people who suffered at your hand i still don't get it why draw
15933340	15938300	all of this attention on thought you didn't convince anyone by your actions why this
15938300	15943500	gathering why let me hack orwell i needed to convince just one person have faulty orwell is
15944140	15949660	cause again the guy harry leaked information about was the man on the inside only an advisor
15949660	15954060	the person who was really been spying on you still around the person who actually went through
15954060	15959420	your stuff passed on the day of the one listening right now the investigator that's me that's right
15959420	15963580	i'm talking to you i knew you had to be around where everyone would come together you had to
15963580	15968700	be listening initiate was just a win for a chance to make sure you'd not immediately go up against
15968700	15974220	those investigator i have a question for you now that you saw orwell firsthand do you really think
15974220	15979100	that the system will help anyone do you think the government would not spy on you as well
15979100	15984460	did you think you were outside the system think again they evaluate even you even you
15984460	15990620	that he saw the madness they observe even you the investigators but we can stop it you can
15990620	15996700	remember you became recruited for being outside of the system outside the nation what if we show
15996700	16002620	people what they store about you that even you are not outside this as we're about to get docs
16002620	16006860	because it's one of those meta games that show your ip address all you need to do investigators
16006860	16012220	upload the data they have on you incriminating yourself this is so mind-bogglingly stupid
16012220	16016620	jewels why would the investigator the government will come after that's exactly the point the
16016620	16022620	evaluation is supposed to be a safety net so that no one misuses orwell active acting on
16022620	16028620	evidence is mandatory if the investigator criminates himself they'll be forced to prosecute them and
16028620	16034220	reveal this evidence that the investigators are actually being spied on this is absolutely mad i
16034220	16040380	do not see this working i would love to offer an alternative investigator it just so happens that
16040380	16045740	a certain catherine dilla qua is in these files too i say we make use of the fact we have control
16045740	16051420	on over orwell let's use as a weapon and turn it against the government there's all there's
16051420	16056780	something dirty to be found about her for sure let's act on that now we're talking no hurting won't
16056780	16062220	help much she's just gonna get replaced this isn't the right way like i said jules just shut it nobody's
16062220	16067420	interested in what you have to say but how can we trust this investigation what what the heck
16068540	16077740	how did they find harrison what's going on oh no seems he just fell prey to the surveillance
16077740	16085900	system oh shit we need to act fast i ratted him him out let me all show you what i can see right
16085900	16095660	now here streams up here's kassandra's file well this feels like a slap in my face they have been
16095660	16102380	collecting all of this they got me flagged potentially dangerous it was this investigator oh
16102380	16107980	don't be mad hen no i can't trust that person i'm out use of your turn my turn
16107980	16117100	hmm oh no what's funny about your file it says here you were offered a release of kassandra
16117100	16123660	for info on thought and you agreed especially given the fact what just happened to harrison
16124300	16129580	damn yes i did i got the offer and i reported harrison i had to kassandra would not have been
16129580	16137580	released otherwise oh it's all falling apart i can't believe this this is horrible but then again
16137580	16144860	you did it for me i don't know what to think merde kass i'm sorry for harry i can't take this
16144860	16152780	anymore leave me out of all of this oh she's gone kassie wait you've got to do this without me i'm
16152780	16160380	sorry user quit well this is just great see how we've messed up all this is is exactly what we
16160380	16166380	need to show the people show them how we've been affected get them to fight with us i shall speak
16166380	16174940	on behalf of nina then nina's popped her clogs i only realize now i might have been my fault nina
16174940	16180300	got investigated in the first place oops but it's all clear the investigator is responsible for hunting
16180300	16185260	her down like this look it was i didn't they chased her to death oh they caused her death no doubt
16185260	16189900	perhaps investigator didn't know any better and we know nina was gilly it does not strengthen my
16189900	16196860	trust though but then the investigator arrested harrison no no we cannot trust such a person
16196860	16203500	meaning the final verdict is oh is he out not a single vote to trust the investigator oh
16203500	16210380	i'm getting sniped are we finally gonna do this my way it's down to the two of us it seems well
16210380	16215740	my plan to gather support for you failed investigator but if you still want to fulfill my plan go on
16215740	16221180	and give delacrox hell you will find something dirty investigators time to make up your mind
16221180	16227340	you can tear down the entire system just complete my plan please i will turn delacrox into a target
16227340	16233180	person i think i can easily activate access to a pc for you as well what
16235260	16241340	hoisin it's hacramen when abraham stopped his work for rosentech and the government he cloned
16241500	16246060	all information he had and hid it in the office he told me and i maintained that the system is
16246060	16250700	programmed to boot itself again in a couple of minutes you'll have access to everything you just
16250700	16255820	need to find the uid of the device i cannot tell you here now that orwell isn't tracking data
16255820	16262700	junk i feel understanding if you judge and incriminate me for what i've done i think i deserve it
16262700	16268860	it's up to you now investigator do the right thing right how do we destroy it finally i thought the
16268860	16275420	disturbance would never end the back end engineer said we've had an unwanted guess we already know
16275420	16280460	it was thought it's about time we undo them we must be strong we must show these people for what
16280460	16284780	they are the nation's safety depends on it finally waiting to incriminate them together as group all
16284780	16289980	we need is a hint that abraham intended this group to carry out acts we could trace the attacks back
16289980	16293660	to a remote pc it will now manually unlock the pc for you
16298940	16301100	destroy delacrox
16301980	16321020	can we replay this section i think the good ending is doing what juliet says okay it's in a

16947740	16954780	demurge i command you to no longer dig around abraham's path i could easily turn you into
16954780	16961820	a target person for disobeying me you would not want that would you what what is strange though
16961820	16968060	is that parenting requested material in this demurge it doesn't matter focus on undoing thought
16968060	16979740	as a whole uh i abraham developed this codex for a project named demurge which has been renamed
16979740	16990780	orwell and i have proof of everything we've got his pc oh so now you know it yes i hired him for
16990780	16995260	orwell this is his doing it was me who wanted him on the project in the first place to get
16995260	17002780	things right with orwell to follow ethical standards only very few people knew here knew that and i wanted
17002780	17009100	to make sure it stayed that way our most ferocious enemy worked for us a person i choose now you
17009100	17014460	know all discovered by the very tool it was all about the irony is not lost on me but while you

17762780	17767660	thing but they make things custom order they don't waste like it's not like they do a big batch of
17767660	17773580	something um they make it like custom order so it does take a bit longer check your email
17773580	17777740	that you got from them now again i'm not uwu market i don't deal with any of the merch that's
17777740	17782380	kind of the the best part about uwu market is that we don't have to touch anything but they do
17782380	17786380	make everything custom order like i ordered my keychains i'm still waiting for them to come
17786380	17791820	but it's because they make it to order they don't make batches does that make sense the stream got

18100140	18103580	mentioned reading books about human nature and really enjoying them there's this game called
18103580	18111340	near otomathia and it's very strange sometimes it has an interesting perspective on humanity it's
18111340	18116380	an action game but some of the stories told might tickle your pickle it takes around 20 hours to
18116380	18120860	complete so is that two endurance rooms you're asking for back to back don't mind if i don't
18122060	18128300	i kill is also easy access night night no do i please no my name's bannish for looker or snooping
18129260	18136620	i kill a gray sweats black compression shirt and a nicotine patch on the forehead gray sweatpants
18136620	18144780	so she can see who goes to the back door near pks near is extremely long near tickles near
18144780	18150780	definitely tickles there you totally know her for the content is her name like to be i think
18150780	18157580	to be or not to be near it's four endings and needs like four placers no no i can't do that
18157580	18165740	i'm no cut out for that okay um probably dumb question but does the meta tag basically mean
18165740	18175020	that in the audio you the narrator are strongy meta tag means yes i'm strongy in that moment and
18175020	18181500	you're reefing in that moment meta means like so you know when i'm like oh the asmr booth or something
18181500	18187100	like that or like it's related to me being like a streamer towards you or that kind of meta behind
18187660	18194140	does that make sense hopefully that makes sense um she does have a really nice dumpy though
18194140	18199500	four main endings and 22 troll ones wait no there's no like fake i was wearing the tinfoil
18199500	18206220	hat skews thing over thanks i didn't edit it myself reeflings did it i just i just yanked it yanked
18206220	18212300	me now your tinfoil hat tell in his it's terrible sorry i'll just look in this direction even though
18212300	18217420	i can't see chat at all in this direction i'm just gonna i'm just gonna look oh i can look at you
18217420	18223500	at the corner of my eye hi there's an ending for each letter in the alphabet is that a joke
18224060	18229900	or is that real okay i'm looking at you from the corner of my eye to make the hats sit properly
18229900	18236140	okay all right reefing ah meta equals strongy strongy not character so you know how like i can be
18236140	18245740	like oh a giantess just absolutely swallows you whole like that's roughly but if it's meta it's me
18246620	18252780	you know does that make sense a girl love it's real but they're really joke endings and
18252780	18256940	anything between them right away okay okay you literally you're giving us a side item
