thank you everyone who has subscribed and helped me get to 10,000 subscribers

23
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:06,000
because now I'm going to do really silly ASMR like this

24
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,000
the make is static

25
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:14,000
the right ear is really messed up

26
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,000
let me get out of this bath

27
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
random static on the ear

28
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,000
don't say that panic hold on let me get out of the bath

29
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,000
random static are you sure it's not the bubbles

30
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:34,000
right ear static it's very set up for fuck sake hold on let me get a towel

31
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,000
I can't get out of the bath already the stream isn't starting

32
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,000
random static why the fuck would there be random static identify yourself right now

33
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
hold on I'm getting out of the bath

34
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,000
hold on the streamer is right next to my bathroom okay

35
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,000
one second I'm gonna go to another room

36
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
okay I'll verify

37
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,000
why are you static

38
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
I'm poking a poke at a snake yet

39
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
trailing water all through

40
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
is the static gone

41
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
is the static

42
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
it's probably the bubbles

43
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
make sure the bubbles off your ear

44
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
make it confusing here

45
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
I'm taking the bubbles off your ear

46
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,000
I swear if that's what the static is you make me get out of the damn thing

47
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
hold on static sound is gone

48
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,000

55
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000

56
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,000

57
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:54,000
I will say thank you to everyone at the end of the stream because I cannot see anything in this current set up

58
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000

59
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000

00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,000
I literally

63
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,000
I don't know what you would like me to do

64
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
do you want me to soap you down

65
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000

66
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
I mean shoot

67
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
I'm going to move the tripod over a little bit

68
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
and then

69
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,000

73
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
I don't know have you built

74
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,000
I literally have all my A smart children's

75
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000

76
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000

78
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:50,000

79
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
but we're in the bath

80
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
you want sponge cleaning

81
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000

82
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
does that mean my ass

83
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000

84
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000

85
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000

86
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000

87
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
a future stream

88
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000

91
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
it's about to take off

92
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
what would you like me to do

93
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
oh and water

94
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
are you ready

95
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
I have like a little spray bottle

96
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
I can spray it everywhere

97
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
because it's just me in the bath

98
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
it doesn't sound very ASMR

99
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
I'm going to be honest

100
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
it sounds pretty shit

101
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
okay I clean your ears I go breathe

102
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
oh yeah

103
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
but by the leaks

104
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000

105
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
at 15,000 subscribers

106
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
I'm going to do it in real life

107
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
that I can't ASMR

108
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000

109
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
so thank you everyone

110
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
don't be

111
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
I can't reach

112
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
my tongue can't reach

113
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
it's a squirt gun

114
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
thank you

115
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000

121
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
do you want to show or I'll do a show

122
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
I'm taking my bath

123
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
can't speak for long unfortunately

124
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000

00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000

127
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
I just can't

128
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
sorry I'm squeaking a boat in this bath right now

129
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
hello

130
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
they can't push me squirtin

131
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
I'm not squirtin

132
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
okay let me pretend to do real ASMR

133
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
okay

134
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
I'm going to brush your ears

135
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
over in the bathtub

136
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
with me

137
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
and then I'm going to look after you

138
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
and I'm going to get you

139
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
all nice

140
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
and clean

141
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
and pristine

142
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
actually if I move the tripod over here

143
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
is the face tracking going to work a bit better

144
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
I'm trying to move above this bath

145
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
without doing that

146
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
rub-dub-dub

147
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
reef links in the top

148
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
and a clean clean clean

149
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
and I'm going to make it pristine

150
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
can you hear all the bubbles in the background

151
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
I wonder if the microphone's backing up

152
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
or not

153
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
do you like bath time with Stourney

154
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
be honest

155
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
we're no longer a pheromone maxing

156
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
we're cleaning up

157
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
do you hear me

158
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
can you hear me young man

159
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
no more pheromone maxing for you

160
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
you're getting clean

161
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
and I'm going to do it to you

162
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
and you're going to say thank you

163
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
yes I think you can hear the bubbles

164
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
you want a mud bath

165
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
right to make me gay

166
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
you should hear me

167
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
okay so this is a dirty sponge

168
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
okay

169
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
you can hear this dry

170
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
so I'm going to put it over your ear

171
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
and then we're going to get the sponge away

172
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
and Stourney's going to clean you

173
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
okay

174
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
and you're going to sit there

175
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
like a good little reef

176
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
like and take it

177
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
do you like my bubbles

178
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
do you like my bubbles

179
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
huh

180
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
okay now we're going to get it wet

181
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
are you ready to get it wet

182
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
okay

183
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
okay all right now

184
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
okay I'm going to squeeze it

185
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
I don't know if you need me to squeeze

186
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
not squeeze

187
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
squeeze squeeze squeeze squeeze

188
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
because I don't want too much wetness on the ears

189
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Stourney isn't I don't trust you

190
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
but I'm having to hear a good girl

191
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
rather do you want me to soap up

192
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
does that sound wet

193
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
when I brush it over your ear

194
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
because the sponge is all wet

195
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
I'll get you all nice and clean

196
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
yeah you want me to

197
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
a light guard

198
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
sure this is a bathtub

199
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
maybe this is a bathtub

200
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
yeah

201
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
okay you want me to soap up

202
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
I'll soap up

203
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
reeflings

204
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
I know you're not used to this

205
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
with other streamers

206
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
but I can do whatever you want me to do

207
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
okay

208
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
you're in control

209
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
so tell me what to do

210
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
okay

211
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
okay

212
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
for this cuttlefish to smell like lemon

213
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
do you hear this

214
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
that's my soap bar

215
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
can we eat the soap

216
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
reefing

217
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
right

218
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
I'm going to sit on my butt

219
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
because I was sitting on my feet

220
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
even in the bath

221
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
I'm gonna get the bar soap wet

222
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
and then we'll start with my feet

223
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
and then

224
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
work our way all the way up the body

225
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
deal

226
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
so I'm putting soap all over my feet

227
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
and my legs right now

228
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
or my pre-legs

229
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
I don't know what you can hear

230
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
so you take the soap bar

231
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
and you do it on top of the feet

232
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
and then you can even use

233
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
your finger in between

234
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
actually here's my feet

235
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
at the side of the mic

236
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
okay

237
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
can you hear my foot again

238
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
all soaked up

239
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
that's my feet

240
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
see

241
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
you can use your hands

242
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
but I'm going to get

243
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
a cloth

244
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
are you ready

245
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
the reason

246
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
you use a cloth

247
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
can you

248
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
did you hear my stomach

249
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
the reason

250
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
you use a cloth

251
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
is because

252
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
I feel replaying

253
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
it exfoliates the skin

254
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
10,000 years of green beans

255
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
you're done

256
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
you're done

257
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
okay

258
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
are you sweating here

259
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
this screen really isn't

260
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
that different from your normal streams

261
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
considering you said you usually stream

262
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
with basically nothing on

263
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
you're just in the bath this time

264
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
the stream isn't any different

265
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
because you never show your clothes on

266
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
you're untrue

267
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
okay so that's the bottom of my feet

268
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
and then for the top of my feet

269
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
I'm doing both feet at the same time

270
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
one

271
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
and now

272
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
I'm doing my little legs

273
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
the four legs

274
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
are you squidding me right now

275
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
TTS on three

276
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
does Brian have a 3D o2

277
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
okay

278
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
I know a little replaying

279
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
it's time for my thighs

280
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
so we're putting soap all over

281
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
my thighs right now

282
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
getting them all

283
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
laying on them

284
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
and then

285
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
it's scrubbing

286
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
to get all the dead skin off

287
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
okay

288
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
over here

289
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
over here

290
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
like to go to a sauna with me

291
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
okay and then you can scrub my back

292
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
and I'll scrub you

293
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
with the off

294
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
there you go

295
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
and now

296
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
replaying

297
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
I'm going to go on my knees

298
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
because

299
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
I need to clean

300
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
the peach and the clam

301
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
next

302
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
oopsie

303
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
that was loud

304
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
so you put a little bit of

305
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
soap

306
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
on the cloth

307
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
and you can put the soap on

308
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
you get it all

309
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
soapy

310
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
there now it's all soapy

311
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
and then clean

312
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
all around

313
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
and you do your peach too

314
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
you need to do your turquoise

315
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
please be careful

316
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
wait why don't you be careful

317
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
you're fucking going to come through the window what's going on

318
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
she's getting lunch ready

319
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
replaying

320
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
the walls

321
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
okay

322
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
so now that

323
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
the peach and the clam

324
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
are spotless

325
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
we get to the tummy tank

326
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
does reefing want to clean

327
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
my tummy for me

328
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
or will I do it

329
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
and make you watch

330
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
wow

331
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
my frickin' pee scene just

332
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
oops hold on

333
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
my screen just went black

334
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
that means the stream is dead or not

335
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
okay I'm still here

336
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
that was scary

337
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
please don't do that again

338
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
mister laptop that terrified me

339
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
okay I'm still here

340
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
let me put some soap on my belly

341
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
isn't that an awesome power school

342
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
put some soap on my belly

343
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
tummy time

344
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
okay you're still alive

345
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
okay I'm squeezing out the

346
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
extra liquid

347
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
and then I'm scrubbing my tummy

348
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
scrub scrub scrub

349
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
all in the tummy

350
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
and then after the tummy

351
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
you can go up higher

352
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
don't worry

353
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
are you going to marry me

354
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
to the coconuts

355
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
by the egg stream

356
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
clean body on

357
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
scratch scratch scratch

358
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
when you exfoliate

359
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
and you scrub all the dead skin away

360
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
your new skin is all nice

361
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
and healthy

362
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
that makes sense

363
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
where is my bar of soap I've lost already

364
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
oh there it is

365
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
okay

366
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
okay and then

367
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
you do your armpits

368
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
because we already did the coconuts

369
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
I don't know what to call them

370
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
but you do your armpits next

371
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
and the reason

372
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
why you can't just keep putting deodorant

373
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
on top of deodorant

374
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
is because you need to remove

375
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
your stank

376
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
if you didn't know

377
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
body odor

378
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
is because of

379
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
I think it's the bacteria

380
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
and you need to get rid of the bacteria

381
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
because it's stinky

382
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
so you need to wash your pits lots

383
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
does it tickle when I wash

384
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
your pits

385
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
I'm supposed to close the top down

386
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
wait do you guys go top down

387
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
I go bottom up

388
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
am I doing it the wrong way

389
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
am I being body washing

390
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
right now

391
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
am I supposed to be top down

392
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
it's always top down

393
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
even in a bath

394
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
okay well this thing

395
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
will be enforced

396
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
to get

397
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
cleaned

398
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
you're getting cleaned

399
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
the bottom to top

400
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
okay

401
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
because the most important thing about it

402
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
is that the bottom

403
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
okay

404
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
in the shower

405
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
I would do top to bottom

406
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
but in a bath I think it's bottom to top

407
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
alright I just need to make sure

408
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
you're clean okay

409
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
one second

410
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
does it tickle

411
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
when you have someone else's cleaning

412
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
yeah

413
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
that's okay if you like to tickle

414
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
okay I think you look nice and clean

415
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
but definitely

416
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
need to water you down

417
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
okay

418
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
you want a homemade slime

419
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
you know

420
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
a homemade slime with stream

421
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
do you like the sound of the water

422
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
tickling

423
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
I think it's relaxing

424
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
but I need to take the soup off of you

425
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
now okay

426
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
so let me just

427
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
let me take all off of you

428
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
okay

429
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
and then your other thing

430
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
we're taking a little

431
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
of more soap

432
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
because you're all squeaky clean

433
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
because you're so small and you're fine

434
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
I feel like bath time

435
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
well mommy

436
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
let's take a look

437
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
let's take a look

438
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
okay

439
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
I'm gonna wipe the soap off my

440
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
one bits

441
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
because I have soap on my one bits

442
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
I'm taking it off

443
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
and then for

444
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
your arms

445
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
or your tentacle

446
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
because you've got eight little, you've got eight arms

447
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
not these legs

448
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
for the arms

449
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
you do the exact same thing darling

450
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
put a little soap on your exfoliating thing

451
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
which is a cloth

452
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
or it could be something I don't know

453
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
I don't think that far ahead

454
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
and then just start with your hands

455
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
and then work the way up the arm

456
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
and that's not enough

457
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
so pour water

458
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
no I'm not cleaning your third leg right now

459
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
that one time I was reincarnated

460
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
that one time I was reincarnated

461
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
as mommy's bath war

462
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
that's terrible

463
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
so that's my right arm

464
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
well done

465
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
the way now you're washing the brain

466
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
I don't have enough brain to wash

467
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
my brain is like a

468
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
chicken thigh or something

469
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
it's so smooth

470
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
the worst part is trying to do your back

471
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
it's fucking impossible

472
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
now we're trying to do my back

473
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
but briefly I know

474
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
that you're really short and you can't reach

475
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
but my goodness I wish you could reach right now

476
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
because I can't do my back of my arm

477
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
I have a problem

478
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
with my shoulders where I can't

479
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
put them like my arms back by

480
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
my head too far because I have damage

481
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
to one of my shoulders

482
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
it's actually a bad one

483
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
starting the bath water bit

484
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
you guys are not bidding

485
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
over the bath water

486
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
I am not shipping this out

487
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
this is a bi-wizard

488
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
I assure you

489
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
my bath water is a literal bi-wizard

490
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
congrats on telepathy

491
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
I think I'm probably doing this

492
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
for a brush

493
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
it wouldn't make it past customs

494
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
you could probably make more

495
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
selling what's left of the lemon soap

496
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
do you like when the cuttlefish

497
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
smells of lemon?

498
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
the customs officer would drink it

499
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
please do not drink my bath water

500
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
if I was ever crazy enough to sell you

501
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
my bath water

502
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
I give my face a little wash too

503
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
I'm not going to use soap

504
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
because if I get it in my eye

505
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
I'm going to cry

506
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
just scrub your face

507
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
and your neck a little bit

508
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
and behind your ears

509
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
don't forget behind your ears

510
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
speaking of forgetting

511
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
behind your ears

512
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
I forgot to do behind your ears

513
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
this is just behind your ears

514
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
I'm from

515
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
one

516
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
I keep forgetting

517
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
to look after you

518
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
but not in a sense that I forget

519
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
to look after you

520
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
I mean, I'm trying to scrub myself

521
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
so

522
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
sorry my hand farted on the bath

523
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
I scrub a little bit

524
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
there you go, now the back of your ears are all clean

525
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
now show me your belly button

526
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
so I'm going to

527
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
fucking

528
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
put soap in your belly button

529
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
and scrub it, okay

530
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
you put soap in your belly button

531
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
I need it, I like it

532
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
I need to do it

533
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
because the belly button is like a germ trap

534
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
okay

535
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
how could you get the mic into me?

536
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
I don't

537
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
the microphone is connected by 10 meter cables

538
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
I shit you

539
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
that was not a fart by the way

540
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
that was the cloth before

541
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
I'll take the soap bath for $100

542
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
jokes aside

543
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
congrats on 10k subs

544
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
here's to a minute

545
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
I'll take the bar

546
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
soap for $100

547
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
oh wait, I can see the messages a little bit

548
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
but I'll go back and read the other message

549
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
someone bet $20 on the bath

550
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
no one is going to send this fucking

551
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
I swear God, if you guys make me

552
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
send you this fucking bath water

553
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
I'm so annoyed

554
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
I have

555
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
seed jars that I could in theory

556
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
put them in but I'm sure the water

557
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
would like, I don't know, customs wouldn't allow that

558
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
how much prep time did this stream take?

559
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
a lot

560
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
I was up an hour and a half

561
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
I go, oh god it's a freaking

562
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
laptop, it's gonna sleep

563
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
I'm currently on a laptop

564
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
removing into my PC

565
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
with a 10 meter

566
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000
set up on a 3DO

567
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
that's on a tripod and my face

568
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
tracking is also on a tripod

569
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
but because I'm lower down

570
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
in the bathtub and the stand up

571
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
that iPhone goes on, it can hardly see me

572
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
this was a lot

573
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
in the making, the 15k

574
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
thai smart is going to be a lot easier

575
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
to produce

576
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
don't have any games or

577
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
stuff, oh I can brush

578
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
your hair I feel like

579
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
I have a brush here

580
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
brush, brush, brush

581
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
while I'm in the bath

582
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
I have a brush here

583
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
oh you can't really pour that much

584
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
unless you move around

585
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
mmm

586
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
I have a brush here

587
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
brush, brush, brush

588
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
small mommy

589
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,000
I mean a little baby

590
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
I'm not very tall

591
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
you're already on your way to 20k

592
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
I don't know what to do for 20k subscribers

593
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
I don't know what yous want

594
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
I mean unless you want shower

595
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
then that's fine, I can do shower easy

596
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
basically

597
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
I was gonna finish that

598
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
and then I was gonna oil up

599
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
and then that would be the stream

600
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
that you get to listen to me oil up

601
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
and keep my skin all nice and smooth

602
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
and soft for you

603
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
and it helps your tent

604
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,000
cause run over my skin

605
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
so yeah

606
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
and of course it's coconut oil

607
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
so what's the price mommy

608
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
there's no price I'm presenting bath water

609
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
that's so gross

610
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
and one a years I'll be like

611
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
one a years I'll post on twitter

612
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
and you'll be like I drank mommy's bath water

613
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
here's a video and then everyone will be like

614
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
oh my god that's her seat jars

615
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
that refill really did

616
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
exercise ASMR

617
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
unfortunately

618
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
I think heavy breathing

619
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
I don't know

620
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
maybe exercise ASMR could work

621
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
ring for ASMR and then bath after

622
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
ooh

623
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
I actually like that idea

624
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
we do ring for ASMR

625
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
so try and be as quiet as possible

626
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
I still know the fucking workouts

627
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
and then afterwards

628
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
we go into the shower how does that sound

629
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
I think we can do that

630
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
that sounds fun for 20k

631
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,000
someone cook there

632
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
yeah

633
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
I'm brushing all your hair

634
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
even though you're bald

635
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
theoretically cause you're

636
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
a cephalopod

637
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
quiet ring fit

638
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
well obviously it's going to be a challenge

639
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
for me to

640
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
to ring fit quietly

641
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
oh wow

642
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
yeah brushy brushy brushy

643
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:18,000
I love that

644
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
a back massage

645
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
how do I back massage a stream

646
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
I mean I could literally in theory

647
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
do that back massage sound right now

648
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
like

649
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
hold on let me face the microphone

650
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
rotate a little bit

651
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,000
okay

652
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
my legs are gonna

653
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
well there's one foot I either say

654
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000

655
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
I know

656
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
if you want a massage

657
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
wait hold on I need to reach for the oil

658
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
okay I got it

659
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
so this is oil

660
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
this is what massage ASMR sounds like

661
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
like literally that

662
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
that's it that's all I can do

663
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
sorry my feet are squeaking on the back

664
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
please don't fall

665
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
well my butt's pressed

666
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
on the floor

667
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
the bathtub

668
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
but this is it that's what massage is

669
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
it's good though oh is it hold on

670
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000

671
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000

00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
hold my legs up in the air

674
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000

676
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
I like when you give me a massage

677
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
you should do it more often

678
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
button briefly

679
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000

680
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000

684
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,000
I mean that's when I get out of the bath

685
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
but I'm not out of the bath yet

686
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000

688
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
in the bath

689
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
and the other one

690
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,000
I think I have a few more things

691
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
more tools to use on you

692
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
the best days I could ask for

693
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
one you're a cephalopods

694
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
so you can breathe under water

695
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
two you love it

696
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,000
massage your feet

697
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
in all seriousness

698
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
pamper yourself spoiled strongy

699
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
you deserve it for pushing yourself

700
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
all this time

701
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
this honestly makes me smile

702
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
knowing that you are taking care of yourself

703
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
do those at the end okay

704
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
thank you everyone for your support

705
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
okay so I had

706
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
an ear picking tool

707
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
after your ears had been a bit

708
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
icky recently okay

709
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
so I can pick your ears

710
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
like this

711
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
because I know sometimes

712
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
when you listen to me for long periods

713
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
playing with the paper headphones you have

714
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
yeah

715
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,000
I'm gonna need you to

716
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,000
let me take out all the gunk in your ears

717
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
while I'm in the bath okay

718
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
is there a bluetooth ASMR

719
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
I would not trust it with my life

720
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
I hardly trust this microphone as it is okay

721
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
okay

722
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
one

723
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
it's okay you're allowed to have stinky ears

724
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
I just need to clean

725
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
I need to let me

726
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
did I not bring ear cleaner with me

727
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
that's like one of the first things

728
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
I always go to for ASMR

729
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
I don't have a freaking ear cleaner

730
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
hold on there's a cabinet behind you

731
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
it might have an ear cleaner

732
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
nope that's my razors

733
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
so I can

734
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
make some balls

735
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,000
and then

736
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
I have a toothbrush do you want a toothbrush

737
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000

okay now I can't find the ear cleaner

739
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
I'm sorry I'm just gonna have to use this

740
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
ear pick

741
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000

742
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000
fucking ear so far

743
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
I'm sorry it's fine I couldn't find

744
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
briefings have ears I thought we were

745
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,000
aquatic

746
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
don't start arguing with the lore

747
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
okay I'm the lore maker

748
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000

749
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000

00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,000
wait hold on

753
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
I'm going to do something very dangerous

754
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
I'm going to change my tracking

755
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
to right in front of me

756
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
if I

757
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
break my tracking because I've done this

758
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
you guys owe me big time

759
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,000
very big time if I break

760
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,000
my equipment because I've done this

761
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
you want to hear my heart

762
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
I'm going to have to lean out of the bath

763
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,000
I am not getting

764
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,000
I'm not bringing the microphone over the bath

765
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,000

766
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000

767
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000

I put oil in it yep that's kind of how it works

769
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000

772
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000

773
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000

774
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000

784
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,000

785
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
get back in the bath

786
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000

healthy person

793
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,000
oh did I have a massive delay

794
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000
or was that just my

795
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
freaking laptop

796
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000

is this the streamlining

799
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,000

if you form our food maker

803
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
I'm a little dismissive

804
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,000
in a bath of water

805
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
with a base more make

806
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,000
with a 10 meter cable

807
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,000
for each ear

808
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
her heart was so fast because she was scared

809
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,000
for her life

810
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,000
I have what is known as a naughty heart

811
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,000
and I was born

812
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
with it unfortunately

813
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000

pheromone maxing

837
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000

839
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000

853
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,000
donathan in October

854
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000

00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,000
I was gonna do

856
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,000
your choice of ink and apple juice

857
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,000
I could 100%

858
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,000
throw in fish stock as well

859
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,000
like if your donations like above

860
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
I don't know say a hundred dollars

861
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
you get a fish stock and a legit

862
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,000
do another bath stream

863
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,000
and it would be like collecting fish stock

864
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,000
after my donathan

865
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
that's disgusting

866
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,000
and I will do it I do not care

867
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
that's absolutely vile and I will do it

868
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
I'm gonna need four

869
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
ink yeah

870
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,000
it's the choice of apple juice

871
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,000
or ink for the top donators

872
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,000
and then

873
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,000
yeah

874
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,000
so either someone will figure out

875
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,000
I have really really stinky pee

876
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,000
oh apple juice

877
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,000
or you can add water

878
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,000
to the ink and do what you want with it

879
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,000
you will need to rehydrate

880
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,000
the ink if you do get sent to the

881
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,000
slightly saturated audio

882
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
I mean the microphones

883
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
very wet I'm not even gonna pretend otherwise

884
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,000
hold on

885
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,000
ASMR

886
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,000
an ASMR brush no this is a makeup brush

887
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,000
that's what they're actually used for

888
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,000
is this the left ear

889
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,000
I have no idea

890
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,000
what the microphone

891
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,000
is hearing in general

892
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
I think it may be just a

893
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,000
I don't know what ear is

894
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,000
oversaturated but there you go

895
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,000
that was the right ear

896
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,000
why did I actually

897
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,000
think apple juice you have too much faith in me

898
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,000
and

899
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,000
here you go

900
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
now do you guys want me to stay in the

901
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,000
bath for longer or do you want me to get

00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,000

957
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,000
I'm going to turn it around

958
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,000

959
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,000

our peaches nice and hydrated

963
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,000
I'm trying to like

964
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,000
try to run so the tracker can still see my face

965
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,000
but it's not really working

966
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,000
so

967
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,000
okay

968
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,000

969
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,000

970
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,000

977
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,000

978
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,000

979
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,000

1091
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,000

1092
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,000

1093
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:10,000

1094
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,000

I can't feel like I want to do 100

1101
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,000
I don't know if I have the stamina for it

1102
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,000
I don't know clapping your hands

1103
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:36,000
ASMR is really difficult

1104
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:40,000
I will read all the gifts at the end

1105
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,000
but thank you everyone for being so kind and generous

1106
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,000
I'm going to take the microphone

1107
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:46,000
into the room with me

1108
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:48,000
so I can catch up on what I missed

1109
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:50,000
okay

1110
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:52,000
can we do 100

1111
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:54,000

1113
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,000
79 counted

1114
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,000
it was above 70

1115
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:06,000
you should keep shooting higher and higher

1116
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,000
if I do 100

1117
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,000
I'm satisfied

1118
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:12,000
if I do 100 I'm satisfied

1119
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,000
that this stream has been nothing but a success

1120
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:16,000
if I don't do 100

1121
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:18,000
shame on all my family

1122
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:20,000

00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,000

00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:30,000
that was not 70

1128
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,000
if you do 100 you get an achievement

1129
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:34,000
literally there's going to be a gamer score pop-up

1130
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:36,000

1131
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:38,000

1132
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:40,000
clap your hands

1133
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:42,000
clap your hands

1134
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:44,000
if you're happy and you know it clap your hands

1135
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:46,000
real

1136
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:48,000
I'm squeaking under the mat because there's so much water

1137
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:50,000
on it right now

1138
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:52,000
okay

1139
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:54,000
100

1140
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:56,000
I need to even if I get tired

1141
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:58,000
I'm looking at myself in the mirror

1142
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:00,000
I'm looking at myself in the mirror

1143
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,000
and you will not stop

1144
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:04,000
until you hear 100 claps mentally in your head

1145
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:06,000
okay

1146
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:08,000
okay we can

1147
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:10,000
don't slip

1148
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:12,000
if I slip this is a hard floor

1149
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:14,000
so if I pass out and the stream is just dead silence

1150
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:16,000
and we like breathing

1151
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:18,000
I'm sure I'll be fine when I wake up but don't worry

1152
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:20,000
okay

1153
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:22,000
okay

1154
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:24,000
1000 claps let's go

1155
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:26,000
wait hold on

1156
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:28,000
I'm getting nervous now

1157
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:38,000
I'm so tired

1158
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:40,000
I'm so tired

1159
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:42,000
I'm so tired

1160
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:50,000
I can't do it

1161
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:52,000
I'm trying

1162
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:54,000
I'm trying

1163
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:56,000
I'm trying

1164
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:00,000
I can't do it

1165
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:02,000
I don't know what that was

1166
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:04,000
I'm so tired

1167
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:19,000
I can't do anymore. I'm out of breath. What was that? I did it! Oh my god! Did I do it?

1168
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:28,000
A, someone said A, someone said 120. Oh, we did it! We did it! You can't see it right now, but I'm spanked in the air.

1169
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:39,000
VTuber does 100 claps per 10 minutes! Oh my gosh! That is insane!

1170
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:44,000
How did we do that? Literally listen to my heart right now. I thought I wasn't going to be able to do it.

1171
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:59,000
Can you hear it? I thought I wasn't going to be able to do it. Sorry, I wasn't supposed to be ASMR. Sorry, I thought I wasn't going to be able to do it.

1172
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:10,000
Okay. Well, I'll work out, honestly. Can you do that live at a convention? What? You want to have one? Who gets paid to oil me up?

1173
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:20,000
Oh my god, that's basebuses. Okay, reflames. I'm going to bring, actually, you know what? I'm just going to do it as I explain it.

1174
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:28,000
I'm bringing the microphone into the stream room so that ambience is going to change, okay? Oh my god, I've covered an oil. How am I supposed to touch my keyboard a mouse?

1175
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:35,000
Right, I'm going to very quickly bring the track and back with me, okay? I'm very, very quickly. Give me one second.

1176
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:42,000
Okay, I'm literally right here. You can hear me enter the bathroom again because the apple is back.

1177
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:56,000
Reflame, you're fine. Relax. Relax, Reflame. You're fine. You're safe. You're loved as I speak on the way out. Okay, don't worry.

1178
00:52:56,000 --> 00:53:03,000
Look, I'm back. Baby, baby, I'm back. Relax. Let me turn on the spacey. Wake up, Mr. P.

1179
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:17,000
I've covered an oil. Okay, is the tracking working? Okay, tracking is working. I'm back in the room. You can hear it's different. Don't worry.

1180
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:25,000
Don't worry, my little Reflame. You're okay. It's okay. You're fine. It's okay.

1181
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:32,000
Okay, I'm going to go get a towel so I can sit on my chair without adding oil because there's enough liquids on this chair as it is.

1182
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:38,000
It's fine. The bathroom's right here. Reflame is right here.

1183
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:48,000
Okay, look at me. I've got it. I've got it. I've got the towel. I'm back in the room. Okay, shh, shh, shh, shh. I'm back.

1184
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:58,000
I'm in the room. I'm putting a towel on the chair so I can sit down, okay? But I need to get you a towel because I didn't dry you off.

1185
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:05,000
Hold on, hold on. You're fine, Reflame. I promise. You're fine.

1186
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:08,000
What? What do you mean you're out of breath? Why would you be out of breath?

1187
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:12,000
I don't know why I would be out of breath. Jeez. Maybe you're the one that's out of breath.

1188
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:19,000
I only clapped with my hands ASMR. Okay, we're in the room. Go close the door so that there's no more echo, okay?

1189
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:22,000
There's no more echo. Are you good to me right now?

1190
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:23,000
Oh, it's okay.

1191
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:26,000
Congratulations, Mama. You are starting to play for the first time.

1192
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:28,000
Thank you. Praise the gesture.

1193
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:38,000
Whoa. Where did that come from? Did you hear that? Where did that come from?

1194
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:45,000
Wait, where's my cola? My cola. I can have it. Wait, I need my cola. I'm addicted.

1195
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:51,000
I'm addicted and I just can't get enough. I just can't get enough.

1196
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:59,000
Okay, ASMR. Shhh. Shhh, little Reflame. We're doing real ASMR. We absolutely aren't.

1197
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:03,000
It's so cute. Wait, did I just? Oh, I just sat on your table. Sorry, I'm about to put oil on.

1198
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:07,000
You're trying to dry you off. Okay, sorry. Sorry.

1199
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:10,000
Oh boy, that was a stream and a half, wasn't I, Reflame?

1200
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:12,000
Hold on, let me re-calibrate.

1201
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:17,000
Okay, I re-calibrate.

1202
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:23,000
Shhh. I couldn't see it earlier, but I counted 127 claps. Oh, yeah.

1203
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:28,000
Okay, shhh. Calm down, little Reflame.

1204
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:31,000
I'm going to dry you off, okay? Because we're at the bath now.

1205
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:33,000
Let me dry you off.

1206
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:35,000
Dry, dry, dry, dry.

1207
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:38,000
Let me dry you off.

1208
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:43,000
This is one of those streams of wall time.

1209
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:51,000
Do you think you can do karaoke up?

1210
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:59,000
I usually get a room half as many claps before I get a mirror in there.

1211
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:04,000
Do you want to know? You know why some women's coconut?

1212
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:06,000
I think it's me.

1213
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:13,000
Ascending? What? Wait, hold on. I need to, like, pop up olive.

1214
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:17,000
I need to open up stream elements, but I need to open up YouTube's track-ins,

1215
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:19,000
so I can say thank you to everyone.

1216
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:22,000
Why am I hypnotizing?

1217
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:27,000
No! Oh my god, I had to reset my models parameters.

1218
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:32,000
My key bindings are back, because I had to reset my models parameters

1219
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:35,000
in order to do the no t-shirt thing.

1220
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:39,000
Okay, as long as the bubbles are still attached to my model, that's the most important thing.

1221
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:42,000
I don't mean to hypnotize you right now, I'm sorry.

1222
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:46,000
I completely, hold on. I think if I hit this button, that would be fine.

1223
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:48,000
Hold on. Hold on.

1224
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:51,000
No, it's all coming apart.

1225
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:54,000
It's okay, really, don't panic.

1226
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:59,000
I'm the only one that's allowed to panic here, because I've messed up terribly.

1227
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:02,000
I'm so sorry. I don't mean to hypnotize you.

1228
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:06,000
No, I'm hypnotizing even more.

1229
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:10,000
Right, okay. I need to open up YouTube to look at any superchats,

1230
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:13,000
and I need to open up stream elements.

1231
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:16,000
Stop hypnotizing! I'm so stopped!

1232
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:18,000
I promise I don't want to hypnotize you right now.

1233
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:21,000
I'm hypnotizing you in the other ASMR stream that's coming up.

1234
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:23,000
But not this one.

1235
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:27,000
No shirt. I had to do it for the stream.

1236
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:29,000
I couldn't be sitting in a bikini.

1237
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:32,000
That's not how you do a bath, unless you bath with this stuff on.

1238
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:34,000
But me personally, nah, I don't really...

1239
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:40,000
Okay, I'm gonna go back and say thank you for all the superchats and stuff, okay?

1240
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:44,000
And then I'm gonna go in YouTube and I'm gonna open up my earnings tab,

1241
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:46,000
because that's for some reason how you access memberships

1242
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:49,000
and people who've done nice things for you via membership.

1243
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:51,000
Okay, shh. Friday and slip hypnotism.

1244
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:54,000
Okay, once I stop having to click stuff, it'll be okay.

1245
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:56,000
I promise it'll be okay.

1246
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:00,000
How do I do this?

1247
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:05,000
Memberships? See your memberships.

1248
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:07,000
Okay, I think I can... okay.

1249
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:08,000
Wait.

1250
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:11,000
What?

1251
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:14,000
Last updated.

1252
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:17,000
Total what?

1253
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:21,000
Oh no, this can't be. Okay, this doesn't look right, but...

1254
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:22,000
I'll try my best.

1255
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:23,000
Okay.

1256
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:25,000
Show proof!

1257
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:29,000
Okay, let me just stop hypnotizing you for a second.

1258
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:31,000
No, stop hypnotizing more.

1259
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:33,000
Okay, okay, okay.

1260
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:36,000
Okay, let's do this.

1261
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:40,000
I'm going to now go through all the thank yous, okay?

1262
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:41,000
And then...

1263
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:42,000
Don't panic, panic.

1264
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:44,000
Did you enjoy that stream?

1265
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:47,000
Was that like fun, crazy now?

1266
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:48,000
Because I was good.

1267
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:51,000
I actually do like the idea that ASMR ring fit stream.

1268
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:53,000
I think that would be cute.

1269
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:57,000
Yeah, that felt like RKO, so I'm not gonna lie.

1270
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:59,000
I was like, I don't know what to do.

1271
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:00,000
It was fun.

1272
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:02,000
Aw, I'm glad.

1273
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:03,000
Thank you for enjoying it.

1274
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:05,000
Stop hypnotizing, it's not possible.

1275
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:07,000
Okay, fine.

1276
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:10,000
The best stream ever, not gonna lie.

1277
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:11,000
The most unhinged.

1278
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:16,000
Yes, thank you so much to everyone who's liked, subscribed, commented.

1279
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:21,000
I like to celebrate Canada 5K Milestones, so...

1280
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:25,000
Soon I will be doing a 15K celebration with thy cam.

1281
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:29,000
Oh yeah, thank you.

1282
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:35,000
Okay, we're gonna go thank everyone for being nice and supportive of me.

1283
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:36,000
What the fuck?

1284
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:40,000
Beryl gave $69.

1285
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:47,000
An introduction might be effective way of stimulating the appetite of your...

1286
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:49,000
...reeflings.

1287
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:51,000
You have to be careful because...

1288
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:57,000
...an errand glance at the serving tray may end with eating out the palm of your own hand.

1289
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:59,000
What does that mean, Beryl?

1290
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:02,000
Where were you saying?

1291
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:05,000
Thank you, Kuhai, for becoming a member.

1292
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:07,000
I appreciate it.

1293
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:12,000
Thank you, Bobalix, for the extended membership.

1294
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:14,000
We are on a tripod.

1295
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:15,000
Yes, you are on a tripod.

1296
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:16,000
You're still on the tripod.

1297
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:18,000
You're actually beneath me.

1298
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:20,000
You're at tummy level right now.

1299
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:24,000
So if you want tummy sounds right now, yeah, you can get tummy sounds.

1300
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:28,000
Cheers, I can't stay for long.

1301
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:30,000
Thank you for the ASMR stream, mommy.

1302
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:31,000
You're more than welcome, cheers.

1303
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:32,000
Thank you for the super chat.

1304
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:35,000
Lord of Storms, 20K reward could be a mud bath.

1305
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:36,000
Oh, the sounds.

1306
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:39,000
Wouldn't mud baths be really farty?

1307
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:41,000
You want tummy sounds?

1308
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:46,000
I recorded the full ASMR sound, so now I can fully make the pregnancy ASMR.

1309
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:48,000
I hope you're excited.

1310
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:51,000
You want tummy sounds?

1311
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:52,000
Wait, hold on.

1312
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:53,000
Oh, wait, you're on a tripod.

1313
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:54,000
Does that make things more...

1314
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:56,000
How do I really release you from this tripod?

1315
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:57,000
Hold on.

1316
01:00:57,000 --> 01:00:59,000
It took me so long to set this up.

1317
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:01,000
Can I even get you off the tripod?

1318
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:02,000
What can?

1319
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:04,000
You're off the tripod now.

1320
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:08,000
Okay, mommy's holding you now, little darling.

1321
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:10,000
This is my tummy covered in oil.

1322
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:11,000
Okay.

1323
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:17,000
Can you hear tummy sounds?

1324
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:19,000
Yeah.

1325
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:26,000
Yeah.

1326
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:28,000
We were bubbling?

1327
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:30,000
Yeah, that's the cola drink.

1328
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:33,000
Okay.

1329
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:35,000
Thank you, tiny spiny.

1330
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:38,000
This stream really isn't that different from your normal streams.

1331
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:41,000
Considering you said you should stream with nothing on TruReel

1332
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:45,000
and absolutely no lies found.

1333
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:49,000
You're just in the bath this time.

1334
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:50,000
Yeah.

1335
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:51,000
Doomsday done.

1336
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:53,000
TTS on for ASMR.

1337
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:58,000
Brian does not have an ethereal head to turn him down really quiet.

1338
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:01,000
Thank you for the super chat.

1339
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:03,000
You want to go in my womb?

1340
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:06,000
I mean, this time tomorrow you might be in it.

1341
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:08,000
You might be in my tummy.

1342
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:12,000
Reluctantly sane.

1343
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:15,000
Mommy, by the end of the stream we're going to be squeaky clean.

1344
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:17,000
Only in body though.

1345
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:20,000
Not in mind.

1346
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:23,000
So pregnancy, ASMR is gender in the making?

1347
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:24,000
No.

1348
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:27,000
In October there's going to be an all audio

1349
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:30,000
if I reach the goal of gender production

1350
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:34,000
and I'm basically going to be begging you

1351
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:37,000
to put a baby in me.

1352
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:42,000
So do with that what you will.

1353
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:43,000
Okay.

1354
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:45,000
Little roofling.

1355
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:51,000
Misaka best, the one time I was reincarnated as mommy's bathwater.

1356
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:52,000
Wow.

1357
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:54,000
Thank you for the tip.

1358
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:56,000
Done, done.

1359
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:59,000
If you insist.

1360
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:03,000
A sleigh saver starting the bathwater bidding.

1361
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:04,000
Oh, should I ask?

1362
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:05,000
No.

1363
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:06,000
We'll do it for a doughnathon.

1364
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:09,000
I'm not taking my fish broth, okay?

1365
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:15,000
There's too much fish broth.

1366
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:17,000
Dips on the bathwater for 20s.

1367
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:18,000
Spidey.

1368
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:20,000
We'll do fish broth for a doughnathon, okay?

1369
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:22,000
I'll take the soap bar for 100.

1370
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:24,000
Jokes aside, congrats on Tanki.

1371
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:25,000
Here's to a million.

1372
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:26,000
Okay, done.

1373
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:30,000
You really think I'm more than happy with that.

1374
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:33,000
With any refill nutmases with me.

1375
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:34,000
Like a million.

1376
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:37,000
I think I'd be overwhelmed at a million, to be honest.

1377
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:41,000
I like my reflux gatekeeping.

1378
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:42,000
Wow.

1379
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:46,000
I mean, I do it myself successfully.

1380
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:51,000
Lord of Storms, you don't have to sin.

1381
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:54,000
Just don't, just please don't drain it.

1382
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:57,000
What, you want me to take a picture of the aftermath?

1383
01:03:57,000 --> 01:03:59,000
Want to put it on Twitter?

1384
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:01,000
You want me to take a picture of the bathwater

1385
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:03,000
that's literally not even transparent?

1386
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:05,000
It's all cloudy and mingin,

1387
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:08,000
because I used soap on myself and actually cleaned myself.

1388
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:11,000
It looks like fucking milk in there.

1389
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:15,000
It looks like milk.

1390
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:20,000
The aftermath.

1391
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:22,000
Well, because there's like oil everywhere, there's milk.

1392
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:25,000
There's like ASMR tools in the bottom of the bathtub.

1393
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:28,000
Like, it all went in.

1394
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:31,000
Anonymous said,

1395
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:33,000
in all seriousness, Trani, you deserve it.

1396
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:35,000
You piss yourself all the time.

1397
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:36,000
Aw, thank you.

1398
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:38,000
This honestly makes me smile, knowing that you're taking care of yourself.

1399
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:41,000
Splish splash, though I take in the bath.

1400
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:44,000
Thank you, Anonymous.

1401
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:47,000
Momo says, ayo, get me a liter of that water

1402
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:49,000
bank's credit card on the car.

1403
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:52,000
Oh, that meme where you're like, bang, bang, bang, bang.

1404
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:57,000
I wouldn't recommend drinking it.

1405
01:04:57,000 --> 01:04:59,000
But you can have it if you want.

1406
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:01,000
Broly legend, so what's the price?

1407
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:03,000
There's no price, you goofy koopa.

1408
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:05,000
You already know my favorite feature where I'm in love.

1409
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:08,000
Is it because I'm wildly inappropriate and Autistic?

1410
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:14,000
It's because I'm wildly inappropriate, isn't it?

1411
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:17,000
Anonymous, uh, oh I read that one, sorry.

1412
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:21,000
Basically whiz, if you follow it, please make a good splat or slap noise.

1413
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:24,000
I'm very, thank you for the 20, I'm very glad I didn't splat,

1414
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:27,000
because I could have really hurt myself now that I think about it.

1415
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:31,000
Because the oil that was on my little knees were not that good.

1416
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:33,000
You're the best, Ronnie.

1417
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:36,000
Oh, you still making me blush.

1418
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:38,000
Wait, you are making me blush.

1419
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:40,000
Hold on a minute, I have a blush toggle.

1420
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:43,000
You're making me blush, replay.

1421
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:51,000
And then Broly legend says, never mind, just be safe.

1422
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:53,000
Because I came out of the bath.

1423
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:57,000
Reluctantly sane, okay fine, take this 20, that was pink, lol.

1424
01:05:57,000 --> 01:05:59,000
Oh no, what was that in relation to?

1425
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:01,000
Was it the first clapping?

1426
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:04,000
Oh my tummy's hungy, I need to feed my tummy.

1427
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:08,000
Gonna have to raid Ronnie's bathroom for all that oil, I'm an American after all.

1428
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:11,000
Okay, this must have been the oil section, thank you Kaidon.

1429
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:13,000
Thank you, reluctantly sane.

1430
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:16,000
You're the clapping, yeah, it's when you clap.

1431
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:19,000
Or the first clap, yeah.

1432
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:25,000
Sassapress, mommy, you can't do this to me, I'm still at work and my little tentacle can't handle it.

1433
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:29,000
Oh no, you're listening at work.

1434
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:36,000
Oh no, you better not do anything that'll get you in trouble with HR.

1435
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:41,000
Thank you for the super chat, Sassapress.

1436
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:45,000
Lord of Storms gifted five memberships, thank you.

1437
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:48,000
Congrats to those who caught it with your face and thank you for the five gifted, thank you, thank you.

1438
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:54,000
The next batch of emotes is coming soon, once Azura's emotes have been fixed.

1439
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:57,000
Mercies have been delivered, so I need Azura's emotes fixed,

1440
01:06:57,000 --> 01:07:01,000
and then everyone can get their missing emotes, does that make sense?

1441
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:05,000
But yeah, thank you because you're helping me get more emotes, thank you.

1442
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:08,000
I love you, Viva.

1443
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:11,000
Thank you for the bath stream, Ronnie.

1444
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:15,000
It was truly one of the greatest stream I've experienced.

1445
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:17,000
Love you so much.

1446
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:22,000
I did not realize that Brian was super loud that entire time.

1447
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:27,000
Well, thank god I'm a loud ASMRtist, let's be honest.

1448
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:30,000
Okay, thank you for this super chat.

1449
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:34,000
Oh, thank you for letting me steal your super chat cherry as well.

1450
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:37,000
And I love you, Viva.

1451
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:42,000
I didn't know, I thought that tip was literally someone being like,

1452
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:46,000
oh yeah, Brian sounds so quiet because I purposely turned him down elsewhere,

1453
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:49,000
but Brian comes out of two sources.

1454
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:51,000
But I've been louder than Brian, so it doesn't matter.

1455
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:53,000
Hey, why is he called Brian?

1456
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:58,000
So the text-to-speech that you hear is actually Brian.

1457
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:00,000
His name is Brian, that's what his thing is,

1458
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:04,000
so if you look up text-to-speech Brian, it'll come up with that voice.

1459
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:08,000
He's called Brian, maybe the guy was called Brian, I don't know.

1460
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:11,000
Hello, Viva, thank you again.

1461
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:14,000
I'm glad you enjoyed the stream experience.

1462
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:16,000
Should I get a highlight clip of it? Maybe I should.

1463
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:19,000
And thank you for letting me steal your super chat cherry.

1464
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:25,000
Misako best, if you're happy and you know what, clap.

1465
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:29,000
I mean, I could probably still do it right now, hold on.

1466
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:31,000
Let me stand up.

1467
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:34,000
I'm not gonna do it for long because my little heart can't take any more,

1468
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:36,000
so I'm pretty sure.

1469
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:39,000
Yeah, okay, yeah, I can do it at all times.

1470
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:41,000
Viva!

1471
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:44,000
I don't want to get too descriptive,

1472
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:49,000
but the oil in between the peach

1473
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:55,000
is making either cheek slide before the other one.

1474
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:57,000
Does that make any sense?

1475
01:08:57,000 --> 01:08:59,000
I don't know.

1476
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:01,000
I don't know if that makes any sense, either does.

1477
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:03,000
But then I'm glad you like it.

1478
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:08,000
Reluctantly sane, thank you for the super chat,

1479
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:10,000
she went unlocked of thunderstruck.

1480
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:16,000
Thick, thick is thickish dread.

1481
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:18,000
Congrats, mommy, you're such a clap master.

1482
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:20,000
Thank you, you're welcome.

1483
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:22,000
I'm a visual learner, could you explain?

1484
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:25,000
Slow, oh, I'm gonna cough, I'm so sorry.

1485
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:32,000
There's a lot of coconut smell in this room.

1486
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:34,000
Hold on.

1487
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:41,000
Sorry.

1488
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:49,000
I'm okay, there's just a lot of aroma going on in the room

1489
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:51,000
and it's going for me.

1490
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:54,000
It's because the coconut's very strong.

1491
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:58,000
And I also recorded a teeny bit of ASMR before the stream,

1492
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:01,000
which required massage oil.

1493
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:03,000
And that had an aroma as well,

1494
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:06,000
so I think my poor little, we can't hear you.

1495
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:08,000
Yes you can, you're twirling me.

1496
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:11,000
Okay.

1497
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:15,000
Our Ragon, thank you for the super chat.

1498
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:19,000
You know the way some women's coconuts coconutally.

1499
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:22,000
I think Strani just created a new phrase for jumping

1500
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:26,000
with cake, ascendingly assily.

1501
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:29,000
This is pure cool, thank you, Ragon.

1502
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:32,000
I appreciate it.

1503
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:38,000
Feremon, Max, they're Strani versus all the perfumes, honestly.

1504
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:42,000
And I love you so much too, little riflin.

1505
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:44,000
I just called it that there, that I missed it.

1506
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:46,000
And then for the memberships,

1507
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:49,000
thank you, Gerald of Reverea.

1508
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:52,000
That's that video game, I've still not played yet.

1509
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:55,000
Lee Wink,

1510
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:58,000
Culker,

1511
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:01,000
Undead Roadkill,

1512
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:05,000
James J. Dahl,

1513
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:07,000
and Doctor Do Nothing.

1514
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:10,000
That looks like everyone that joined today.

1515
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:14,000
Thoustake Strim.

1516
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:17,000
Oh here we go, Thoustake Strim.

1517
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:20,000
Are you with the Sonic Fire 65?

1518
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:24,000
Do, demo, pa, budding, gauge.

1519
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:27,000
I don't know if it also counts as good, I don't know.

1520
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:29,000
It looks very confusing, I'm so sorry.

1521
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:31,000
It basically was, so fuckwin.

1522
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:33,000
Right, I said you yesterday, I remember you.

1523
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:35,000
Okay, I think that's everything, God, how we did that?

1524
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:36,000
She definitely bit you with that.

1525
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:38,000
Well, I'm dying.

1526
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:41,000
Anonymous.

1527
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:43,000
Anonymous says,

1528
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:45,000
I was having such a do-do-dee dealing with people,

1529
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:47,000
so I'm glad that you streamed as soon as I came off work.

1530
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:49,000
Crazy, I'm more invested in a streamer

1531
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:51,000
who's been doing this for two months now,

1532
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:53,000
and for streamers who've been at it for years.

1533
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:55,000
That's one thing, sometimes.

1534
01:11:55,000 --> 01:12:00,000
The mind craves new experiences and things, and that's okay.

1535
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:04,000
That's why I'm never like upset if anyone wants to move on to the next streamer.

1536
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:06,000
I don't get in solid or jealous,

1537
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:09,000
I just want you to be able to relax and have a good time.

1538
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:11,000
I mean, Anonymous, you literally said the very thing

1539
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:13,000
that I think is important.

1540
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:16,000
Have you had a rubbish day at the end of stream?

1541
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:18,000
Yeah, I streamed.

1542
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:19,000
Sorry.

1543
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:22,000
If you have a rubbish day at the end of

1544
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:24,000
what seems blown out,

1545
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:26,000
hold on, I'm gonna adapt.

1546
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:29,000
Okay, I've turned down the things a little bit.

1547
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:31,000
If you have a rubbish day at the end of work

1548
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:33,000
and you want to relax and chill,

1549
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:34,000
then I say go for it.

1550
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:37,000
And if I'm not the streamer that helps you de-stress,

1551
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:38,000
then I want you to,

1552
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:42,000
well, first I want you to try out the five other viola girls.

1553
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:45,000
But if we're not for you, guess what?

1554
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:46,000
I think you...

1555
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:47,000
I think crawfish.

1556
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:48,000
I'm not crawfish.

1557
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:50,000
I'm a crawfish.

1558
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:52,000
Don't call me a crawfish.

1559
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:54,000
What the fuck?

1560
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:57,000
Are you planning on cooking me?

1561
01:12:57,000 --> 01:12:59,000
You better not.

1562
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:01,000
Bitch, stop!

1563
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:03,000
Don't do that.

1564
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:05,000
He's so silly.

1565
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:14,000
You call him?

1566
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:15,000
No.

1567
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:17,000
Strongly 10% off-gamer subs.

1568
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:18,000
Fuck it.

1569
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:20,000
But for your luck, congrats on 10,000 subscribers.

1570
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:21,000
Thank you so much.

1571
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:26,000
I hope this celebratory stream was worth the wait

1572
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:29,000
because it took me so long to be able to do it.

1573
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:32,000
But there is a 15K thigh ASMR coming up.

1574
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:34,000
So please don't look out for it.

1575
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:36,000
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

1576
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:38,000
You're not sure about the cooking part,

1577
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:40,000
but I'll definitely eat you.

1578
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:44,000
I do what she be sometimes.

1579
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:45,000
Oh, she's coming back though.

1580
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:46,000
She is back home,

1581
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:48,000
but she's not very well right now.

1582
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:51,000
I don't know what's actually going on with Darling Shebe.

1583
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:53,000
She's really feeling unwell,

1584
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:55,000
which is such a shame.

1585
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:00,000
Is Little Imig...

1586
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:01,000
I don't...

1587
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:03,000
No one's online for me to redirect into...

1588
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:04,000
Oh dear.

1589
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:07,000
Oh dear, oh dear.

1590
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:10,000
And we're doing ASMR,

1591
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:13,000
which makes it harder to redirect into literally anyone.

1592
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:17,000
Oh dear, oh dear, oh dear.

1593
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:19,000
Cutlery strongy.

1594
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:21,000
Thank you for the correction.

1595
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:22,000
You get one kiss.

1596
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:26,000
For being so open-minded to being corrected.

1597
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:28,000
Anonymous.

1598
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:32,000
I subscribe to members to all the girls in Beale there.

1599
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:34,000
You may not always be the ASMR stylist

1600
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:35,000
I listen to when I go to sleep.

1601
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:39,000
But you definitely stream my watch when I want to laugh.

1602
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:41,000
You continue to be well and unhinged and all to sleep.

1603
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:43,000
Oh, anonymous, thank you.

1604
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:46,000
Yeah, I have to admit my ASMR is a bit...

1605
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:50,000
Literally me who does ASMR stream,

1606
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:53,000
also me who claps for like 120 times in a row.

1607
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:58,000
We stream every day the moment I'm done from work.

1608
01:14:58,000 --> 01:15:00,000
It's so relaxing and rest my brain.

1609
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:03,000
Yeah, I put like nice cold ice on your brain

1610
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:06,000
after it feels like it's on fire from work.

1611
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:09,000
Strongy, you can correct me whenever you want.

1612
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:12,000
That's correct in time, really.

1613
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:15,000
But it's okay.

1614
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:17,000
I know you try your best.

1615
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:21,000
Strongism is a final weapon you have to go against, yeah.

1616
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:22,000
Yeah.

1617
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:38,000
Are you allergic to cuttlefish?

1618
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:42,000
Would you still lick me if you were allergic to me, be honest?

1619
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:54,000
Okay, there's no one that I can redirect into that's doing ASMR, unfortunately.

1620
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:59,000
So I think I'm just gonna redirect into Amy's stream

1621
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:04,000
and you guys can wait a couple of hours for her to show up.

1622
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:11,000
It's in three, it's in two and a half hours.

1623
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:14,000
So yeah, you just wait two and a half hours for little Amy.

1624
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:16,000
Okay, she'll be coming on set.

1625
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:18,000
She's not coming on set.

1626
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:22,000
Sorry.

1627
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:25,000
Please correct us some more with some aggressives.

1628
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:27,000
And whispering.

1629
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:29,000
Refling.

1630
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:35,000
You were wiggling around in that bath and it was so hard to clean you.

1631
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:41,000
You know it makes it harder for me to do what I need to do.

1632
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:44,000
So do you need punishment?

1633
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:54,000
Oh, it's oil.

1634
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:56,000
I'm eating coconut oil.

1635
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:58,000
I put it against my chest.

1636
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:00,000
Sorry, there's oil in my mouth right now.

1637
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:03,000
I forgot about that.

1638
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:05,000
I need to clean the microphone.

1639
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:07,000
I just put oil in my mouth.

1640
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:12,000
Well, I think I'm gonna gag.

1641
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:21,000
Well, I'm gonna drink some cola because that was not supposed to happen.

1642
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:28,000
Oh, okay.

1643
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:30,000
Okay, I'm okay.

1644
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:32,000
I'm good, I'm good.

1645
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:34,000
Okay, it's okay.

1646
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:37,000
Just for the folks at home, please do not put oil in your mouth.

1647
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:39,000
Okay, it's fine.

1648
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:43,000
Perfect way to end an ASMR stream, real and true.

1649
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:48,000
Okay, I'm gonna go clean up because the aroma of everything that's on me right now is making me gag.

1650
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:50,000
And I've just put it in my mouth.

1651
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:52,000
Thank you so so much, Reflings.

1652
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:56,000
I love and absolutely adore you and thank you for anyone who gives any of Veiler a chance,

1653
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:58,000
if that's me or my gen mates.

1654
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:01,000
If I'm not for you, please check the links in the description to my gen mates.

1655
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:03,000
They might be much more your speed.

1656
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:07,000
Thank you so much for any likes, any comments, any subscriptions.

1657
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:10,000
Don't be afraid to subscribe because guess what?

1658
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:13,000
We're already doing a 15k ASMR celebration.

1659
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:15,000
It's coming soon.

1660
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:18,000
And then for 20k subscribers.

1661
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:21,000
So 15k is in real life thycam ASMR.

1662
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:25,000
And then 20k is ring fit for one hour ASMR.

1663
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:28,000
It's as quiet as I can so it's probably all breathing.

1664
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:33,000
And then I get a shower and I'll bring you into the shower with me, deal?

1665
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:35,000
So yeah, thank you everyone who supports me.

1666
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:39,000
I'm gonna redirect you into any silent room, okay?

1667
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:41,000
So don't worry about it.

1668
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:46,000
And for those who are a member, I have a karaoke stream that's going up in 30 minutes, okay?

1669
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:50,000
So I'll see you in 30 minutes once I'm all clean and not oily.

1670
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:53,000
Thank you so so much for hanging in.

1671
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:55,000
I'll see you good figures later, okay?
