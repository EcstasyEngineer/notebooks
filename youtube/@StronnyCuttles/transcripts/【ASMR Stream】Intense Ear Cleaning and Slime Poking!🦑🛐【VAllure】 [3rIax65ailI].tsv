0	16000	I'm supposed to blue play as a- I live noise game, noise filter.
16000	32000	First thing first, I need to get close. I can't accept.
32000	36000	What was your name again?
36000	52000	It seems like your ears, oh dear, are a little bit cloned up, Mr. Wiefling.
52000	62000	Let me just inspect this ear. Oh dear, that's good.
62000	72000	Mr. Wiefling always really cloned up here.
72000	80000	Oh dear, and now let me check your other ear, Mr. Wiefling.
80000	90000	Do I sound muffled in this ear as well? Oh dear, there's something obstructing your ear canal.
90000	96000	Oh, that's my, I mustn't sound so muffled.
96000	112000	Oh wow, nurse, re-in, nurse, I see. Just came to our ear cleaning suite with our assistants, the snowberries, thank you.
112000	118000	Alright, okay, I think I know what to start with.
118000	128000	I feel like, oh sorry, Mr. Wiefling, you're not a little feeling your client at my ear cleaning facility.
128000	140000	Okay, first thing first, we're going to do is listen to the wax that's stuck in your ears.
140000	158000	It has an anti-fat-packed properties because ear wax is a pretty fatty substance, so just going to spray over your ear.
158000	162000	Don't worry, it's wet, so it's not, it's cool.
170000	184000	Okay, then for this ear, Mr. Wiefling, do you feel like that did anything for you?
184000	194000	Or do you need a bit more, I think you need a bit more ear, oh dear.
194000	202000	Okay, now that the solution on your ear, I'm just going to dry every single ear canal.
202000	212000	Yes, your actual ear and the earwax, because I don't want you dripping my Mr. Wiefling, that's not very appropriate for this thing.
212000	220000	Okay, dear, dear, but I still sound a little old.
220000	226000	You are probably the worst case I've seen in a while.
226000	230000	Are you listening with headphones on?
230000	238000	Is your day job maybe working at a PC?
238000	242000	Let me see, not so good.
242000	246000	What?
246000	250000	Not so good at all.
250000	254000	This sound has just gotten off of my focusing.
254000	270000	What the?
270000	276000	Right, I've taken off the fucking noise gate, back to the roleplay boys.
276000	278000	Oh dear.
278000	290000	Yes, I think you may be wearing a lot of headphones, because this is the most clogged ears I've seen in a very long time.
290000	294000	Okay, your ear is now clean at all.
294000	304000	I'm going to do this check here and canal and see if I can remove any debris at this point.
304000	320000	But that is very tightly packed in.
320000	330000	How do you think we should get rid of a good maybe ears?
330000	334000	A Japanese ear cleaning tool in combination.
334000	342000	This is quite the challenge today, Mr. Wiefling.
342000	346000	Just checking.
346000	350000	Definitely a solid mass over your ear.
350000	356000	I assume this ear is going to be the exact same story.
356000	360000	Oh yeah.
360000	368000	I think what we'll have to do is do this day by day.
368000	372000	Just take out a little bit.
372000	376000	But the procedure shouldn't take more than 12 minutes, okay?
376000	380000	So don't worry, I won't steal too much of your time.
380000	384000	I'm sure you're a very busy man, Mr. Wiefling.
384000	392000	So I'm just going to try and dislodge some of the ear.
392000	396000	It should be hard again.
396000	406000	Let's see if this tool will offer a bit more texture here.
406000	412000	Here.
412000	420000	I'm just removing what I can very delicately because I don't want to hurt your ear.
420000	424000	So you'll need to tell me in the hearts, okay?
424000	436000	Because we don't want no problem.
436000	442000	This isn't easy.
442000	444000	Okay.
444000	448000	We're getting somewhere, Mr. Wiefling.
448000	460000	Getting somewhere.
460000	464000	Oh, you work in an ink factory, Mr. Wiefling.
464000	466000	That's a curious job.
466000	478000	What do you do when you work in the ink factory?
478000	486000	Definitely get some work done.
486000	494000	That was painful, wasn't it?
494000	498000	Your ears are already feeling some relief.
498000	502000	I've actually not even cleaned one ear out fully yet.
502000	506000	So I've still muffled so you guys are jumping ahead of the roleplay.
506000	510000	Hold on.
510000	516000	It's gone in your ear.
516000	522000	I've put it in a creepy patch, isn't it?
522000	524000	You feel the ink machine?
524000	526000	Oh, you feel the ink machine?
526000	534000	Yeah, I guess it probably runs on some sort of liquid that is high in vitamin D extract.
534000	540000	I don't know if you guys will forget.
540000	544000	Yeah.
544000	548000	Oh, you have Associates, Mr. Wiefling, that work in the production of the ink as well.
548000	554000	It sounds like a very efficient factory.
554000	556000	That's quite a good job.
556000	562000	My job is to have one that I close pretty quickly.
562000	566000	Well, of course I have my lovelaces.
566000	568000	You did my appointment with the license.
568000	570000	Wow.
570000	572000	I've almost got it actually. Hold on.
572000	576000	I've literally almost got this ear clean.
576000	578000	You're very close.
578000	586000	Very close to getting this ear dislodged.
586000	590000	Okay.
590000	596000	But we have to be super gentle because I don't want to hurt you.
596000	604000	Oh, I think it's coming.
604000	606000	Do you hear me now, Mr. Wiefling?
606000	608000	Did that work?
608000	610000	I think it did.
610000	612000	Hold on. Let me just spray down your ear again.
612000	614000	Just so...
614000	616000	Wow.
616000	620000	That's perfect.
620000	624000	There we go. Let me just quickly rub down your ear.
624000	630000	And then we will tackle the other one here.
630000	632000	Oh, that's great.
632000	634000	I'm glad you feel relief in this ear.
634000	642000	I'm just going to make sure to brush away all the debris because it might sound like your hearing is completely back.
642000	646000	But your baseline, Mr. Wiefling, was very low.
646000	654000	So I'm just going to make sure to brush away any nastiness that may have been left over, okay?
654000	658000	Because we don't want any nastiness.
658000	660000	I just had a cat here in your ear.
660000	662000	Do you have a cat, Mr. Wiefling?
662000	664000	Do you have two cats?
664000	670000	What are their names?
670000	672000	Yeah.
672000	676000	Wow. Okay, that's probably all the dust.
676000	680000	And then we're super careful.
680000	686000	Just gently gently rub that.
688000	696000	Okay, this ear, I think, I'm just going to take another look into it.
696000	700000	But it looks pretty clear to me.
700000	702000	I will come back to it just in case.
702000	710000	But unfortunately, this ear is still very much full and muffled.
710000	730000	Let's see what we can do over here.
730000	736000	Oh, oh, you don't have a cat, Mr. Wiefling, but you had named them after the Fieler Girls.
736000	740000	Or unfortunately, I'm not familiar with the Fieler Girls.
740000	748000	Would you like to describe in great detail who or what the Fieler Girls are?
748000	754000	Whilst I clean up this very troublesome ear of yours.
754000	760000	Just, again, just tell me if there's any pain and I'll stop.
760000	772000	Because I definitely don't want to hurt you.
772000	782000	Oh, that's bad.
782000	784000	My cat's name is Wandalabism.
784000	786000	Interesting name for a cat.
786000	792000	I wonder, did you come up with that by yourself?
792000	798000	Okay, there's no pain. Good.
798000	806000	I'm just trying to pick apart the large nerves and then I can actually clean your ears.
806000	810000	Oh my goodness, this is, you're just tasting me.
810000	814000	This is the most difficult case I've had in very long time.
814000	830000	It keeps the ear clean, yeah.
830000	834000	So, Mr. Wiefling, you're having a tingly experience.
834000	836000	Oh, that's good.
836000	842000	My ear tingles can be quite relaxing.
842000	852000	Maybe you can give me a pack for some tickles, we are.
852000	858000	One of them has warm and colored hair. It's totally not safe.
858000	866000	Okay, one interesting girl group this sense.
866000	872000	There's a very cute little sister type and also our mummy is pretty hot.
872000	876000	Oh, this sense of a very interesting girl.
876000	886000	And it sounds like the guava base is covered.
886000	890000	Mr. Wiefling, did I hear you correctly?
890000	898000	You asked me to smell your ears.
898000	908000	Well, this one's blocked, so I can't really tell you, but...
908000	910000	Interesting.
910000	918000	Well, the good news is you don't have any signs of infection because you can smell it.
918000	922000	And I didn't smell any signs of infection.
922000	930000	Just need to get this.
930000	934000	And almost there, I really am.
934000	938000	I swear you have some very difficult ears.
938000	952000	Hold on, let me get on you too, because I don't think this is working as well as I had hoped.
952000	962000	Wow.
962000	968000	Oh, that was quite loud over here.
968000	972000	We're getting there. We're almost there, Mr. Wiefling.
972000	978000	And then you can finally hear me and my family.
978000	998000	Okay.
998000	1006000	I think I got it.
1006000	1014000	Hello, Mr. Wiefling. How can you hear me?
1014000	1016000	That's going well.
1016000	1022000	I just need to make sure there's no remnants, because there might be some left over.
1022000	1030000	Gunk is always, but I sound a little clearer.
1030000	1034000	Oh, there we go.
1034000	1052000	Clear, clear.
1052000	1062000	I think everything sounds clear now. That's good, Mr. Wiefling and glad.
1062000	1074000	Okay, just a quick brush up to make sure that you don't have any more dust or dirt in them.
1074000	1078000	You should begin to go.
1078000	1086000	Oh, I forgot to spray you a little bit, sir. You don't mind if I spray on you, right?
1086000	1096000	There we go. Just tap the over here so that it's not bled on.
1096000	1104000	And then give you a little brush brush.
1104000	1114000	There we go.
1114000	1122000	Wow.
1122000	1126000	I think so, and while I'm here, never hand in a Scottish Dome.
1126000	1136000	Okay, I think we did it. Your ears, Mr. Wiefling, appear clean.
1136000	1142000	Very clean.
1142000	1148000	Okay, goodbye.
1148000	1156000	Thank you so much for your attendance at the care clinic.
1156000	1164000	I hope you had a good day and that all of your issues have been resolved now.
1164000	1172000	For the matter of payment, you have to give me one kiss.
1172000	1180000	Mr. Wiefling, I said you have to give me one kiss.
1180000	1190000	You need to kiss me. Kiss me.
1190000	1196000	Good morning. Good evening. Good afternoon, my little Wiefling.
1196000	1202000	Did you like my cringey roleplay? I thought I did a pretty good job.
1202000	1208000	I have a confession reference. I accidentally don't want someone yesterday.
1208000	1214000	And I'm 99% sure.
1214000	1218000	Oh, pardon me.
1218000	1222000	Oh, pardon me.
1222000	1228000	I think it was dimsul. I don't want to hold you yesterday.
1228000	1236000	Your dad is going to be even more confused when you claim you have five dollars. That makes him a granddad.
1236000	1242000	It was good. Yeah, you liked it. Did you like it? You were all muffled.
1242000	1246000	I wonder if I have a roleplay like that coming out soon.
1246000	1252000	I said thank you for $2,000. Can I pay again?
1252000	1260000	Being called Mr. Wiefling makes me feel like a big shot. I also must have lost the address.
1260000	1264000	And then let me just check the...
1264000	1268000	Oh, of course it doesn't work, so I need to go into my own life struggle.
1268000	1274000	What? That's me.
1274000	1278000	Wait, why is it not displaying?
1278000	1286000	And then thank you very much, Brightgo for the day and gifted memberships. We appreciate you.
1286000	1290000	And congrats to all the Wieflings that caught one. Be nice and say thank you.
1290000	1294000	John07, thank you for becoming a member.
1294000	1298000	Vanished, thank you for becoming a member.
1298000	1306000	Rockstar, the Avril Fluff, Jupro, Mamosa.
1306000	1312000	Mamosa became a member. When did you do that?
1312000	1318000	Type N and Tiki, thank you also for becoming a member. What the heck?
1318000	1328000	I'm so sorry, you little Wieflings, I'm exhausted.
1328000	1336000	I'm okay, but I have nine toenails now.
1336000	1342000	Oh, floss, thank you for becoming a member. I appreciate you.
1342000	1346000	I don't remember when Mamosa became a member.
1346000	1350000	Thank you so much for becoming a member.
1350000	1354000	I apologize about any yawns or complaints of pain.
1354000	1362000	I'm online pain killers, but I'm surviving. It's not a big deal.
1362000	1372000	Am I allowed to say the story or pour one out from all me the toenail?
1372000	1382000	You were sacrificed in the name of pretty feet and you went out the way mommy wanted ya to be sexy.
1382000	1392000	I definitely need a big sleep. I did get one, but I think it's one of those.
1392000	1396000	I need rest and recovery sleep.
1396000	1406000	The pointy tool was a bit surprising. I definitely felt that going into my tool.
1406000	1422000	I felt that basically once they tested if I could feel anything, once it came through and I was like, no, I don't feel anything.
1422000	1430000	They got to work and they said, lie back, you don't want to see this.
1430000	1446000	It's currently covered up right now and I need to change it in less than 48 hours so I get to see what the damage is.
1446000	1454000	They've given me a medical bag of gauze and everything to take away, but I know how to clean and change bandages.
1454000	1456000	It's not a big deal.
1456000	1460000	Whatever you want to call it.
1460000	1466000	Strongly the one K.A smart video was amazing. You liked it.
1466000	1468000	I'll need a check actually.
1468000	1477000	So YouTube put limited ads on my let me hold it video and then I was like, I'll find that's fair because of the content.
1477000	1483000	But on a whim, I applied to get limited ad taken off it and they gave me it.
1483000	1491000	So I've just lost like 40,000 views worth of like generated ad revenue that would have paid for that artwork.
1491000	1501000	Thank you for becoming a member. I appreciate it.
1501000	1505000	Yes, chat is so great.
1505000	1513000	Abba tea, abba dye, rip strongy feet fans, well she be and Emma work again.
1513000	1517000	So you don't have to worry.
1517000	1521000	But I apologize for yours. I am a very sleepy baby.
1521000	1525000	But we are going also. Thank you.
1525000	1529000	I say for the rage goodness gravy. I can't.
1529000	1531000	Sorry. I've only takes off.
1531000	1535000	I'll just pop you down in my lap.
1535000	1537000	I've literally sweat up and only takes off.
1537000	1541000	It's so damp in here.
1541000	1545000	I was trying to do the roleplay right.
1545000	1547000	I can't take it. I can't get it.
1547000	1551000	It's not okay. This is so wet.
1551000	1555000	What?
1555000	1557000	Would you never do a ridicule again?
1557000	1561000	Oh, I have no intention of doing one.
1561000	1563000	Like I was going to do for a month on a phone.
1563000	1569000	I was going to do like these pictures and be like this says for feet people only.
1569000	1571000	Yeah, feet people ain't getting fit.
1571000	1575000	Nothing. Nothing.
1575000	1577000	My hair looks like watermelon candy.
1577000	1581000	Heck yeah, it does.
1581000	1585000	A story called ACMA.
1585000	1591000	I've said this before but they were called the twins in development.
1591000	1595000	Or I dubbed them the twins in development.
1595000	1599000	Why you ask? Because I don't know.
1599000	1601000	It just came naturally to me to call them the twins.
1601000	1607000	They are called.
1607000	1611000	How much for the glove?
1611000	1613000	It's so sweaty and it's terrible.
1613000	1617000	My hand can breathe now.
1617000	1623000	But I also have this box of like weird bailet slime.
1623000	1625000	I don't, let me get it.
1625000	1627000	I was going to bet it.
1627000	1631000	I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
1631000	1633000	Even if I had to ASMR stream.
1633000	1635000	Oh, sorry, sorry.
1635000	1639000	I bought this weird box of slime.
1639000	1641000	Hold on.
1641000	1645000	What?
1645000	1647000	It's so good.
1647000	1651000	It sounds really bad but I just have all my figurines
1651000	1657000	wink wink on display in this room.
1657000	1663000	Okay, Bono has got that light plastic on it.
1663000	1671000	I'm going to turn down the volume.
1671000	1675000	I'm going to cut the slime.
1701000	1711000	The black.
1711000	1717000	Okay, I think I can fit the volume up again.
1717000	1721000	What the fuck is this?
1721000	1727000	So I was supposed to put this on your ear.
1727000	1733000	Did you hear what this is?
1733000	1737000	Oh, it's sticky.
1737000	1741000	This isn't slime all.
1741000	1745000	I was supposed to put it on your ear.
1745000	1749000	Just even make a noise.
1749000	1757000	Do you hear that?
1757000	1759000	It sounds like nothing is shit.
1759000	1767000	I'm going to scum ass.
1767000	1771000	Mommy, I always thought that you are that person
1771000	1775000	to interview the girls.
1775000	1781000	Did that sexual harassment?
1781000	1785000	Wait, so does this slime not do anything?
1785000	1787000	Wait, hold on.
1787000	1791000	I'm taking my headset off so I can hear it.
1791000	1795000	Oh my god, it's so sticky.
1795000	1801000	Why?
1801000	1805000	It's going everywhere as well.
1805000	1809000	I'm going to have to clean all of this.
1809000	1813000	The future person must not stream live.
1813000	1817000	Click, no clickbait.
1817000	1821000	Okay, I'm just going to use my finger.
1821000	1825000	Hold on.
1825000	1831000	It's on me now.
1831000	1843000	What does that sound like?
1843000	1845000	Do you hear it just sounds like
1845000	1847000	slightly sticky sounds?
1847000	1851000	I paid like all $12 for this.
1851000	1861000	I don't know, maybe it's one of those tingle sounds
1861000	1865000	that are better for like layering with other ASMR.
1865000	1869000	Like this.
1869000	1871000	How's Gimli?
1871000	1875000	Actually, Fiko snuck in at the room.
1875000	1877000	He's not supposed to be in here.
1877000	1881000	And this freaking tail was hanging off the window
1881000	1885000	literally like three minutes before moving upstream.
1885000	1889000	And I was like, get it out.
1889000	1893000	Because they're not supposed to be in this room at all.
1893000	1899000	Because I've got far too much equipment in here.
1899000	1901000	Yeah, it's kind of low.
1901000	1905000	Wow, it just kind of sounds like plastic.
1905000	1909000	Oh, it's supposed to kill my hands.
1909000	1913000	It's supposed to kill my nose.
1913000	1915000	Oh, we're done.
1915000	1925000	I'll just put it on this used napkin from a week ago.
1925000	1927000	I'll record with it.
1927000	1931000	Maybe I can use it as a layer to take an experience.
1931000	1933000	$12.
1933000	1935000	Let me hold it.
1935000	1937000	Let me.
1941000	1943000	Oh, yucky.
1943000	1947000	Oh, there's like a residue on my hands now.
1947000	1949000	Oh.
1959000	1961000	I actually...
1961000	1965000	Sorry, I'm trying to get the residue on my hands.
1965000	1967000	How much for that napkin?
1967000	1969000	It's not real. It's not my own.
1969000	1975000	It's like both my pinkies are all black.
1979000	1981000	Okay.
1983000	1985000	I'll put it on for more e-paste.
1985000	1987000	You don't need to go on a page for more.
1987000	1989000	Right, where's my...
1989000	1991000	Oh, here it is.
1993000	1995000	My god.
1995000	1997000	It's my little...
1999000	2003000	I don't know if you guys like tapping like that.
2003000	2009000	Just testing your hearing now after your little...
2017000	2019000	Is today the watch along?
2019000	2021000	It should be unless I completely messed up.
2021000	2025000	I actually had to leave.
2025000	2027000	I was putting up my streams for the week.
2027000	2031000	And then I was like, oh, should I slow?
2031000	2033000	I have to go for my doctor's appointment.
2033000	2035000	So I just disappeared.
2035000	2037000	And all I've got up is...
2037000	2039000	Wait, I've up at the...
2039000	2041000	Yeah.
2041000	2043000	It's a Transformers...
2043000	2045000	Autobots...
2045000	2047000	Fallout.
2051000	2053000	It's like both lane.
2053000	2055000	Yeah.
2055000	2057000	We're watching Transformers.
2057000	2059000	The first one with Sam Webuki.
2059000	2061000	So congrats if your name is...
2063000	2067000	It's scheduled for 4.15pm.
2067000	2073000	That is probably why it's at the horrifically wrong time.
2073000	2075000	It should be 6.15am.
2075000	2077000	Lol.
2077000	2083000	Okay, I've just updated the member watch along.
2083000	2085000	Does it look right on your hand now?
2085000	2087000	Smile.
2091000	2093000	I think I've put the wrong time for the Minish Cap as well.
2093000	2095000	Actually, hold on.
2095000	2099000	Yeah, I've put 4pm instead of 4am for the Minish Cap.
2099000	2101000	Don't mess.
2103000	2105000	I'm not very brave, am I?
2107000	2109000	I can't wait to show you guys.
2109000	2111000	Actually, I'll show you right now.
2111000	2113000	Oh, no, I can't.
2113000	2115000	Because I don't think I have a...
2115000	2117000	Transformers...
2125000	2127000	AC...
2127000	2129000	What the fuck, AC?
2129000	2131000	Call her again, Ben.
2131000	2133000	What?
2133000	2135000	Is AC's Twitter down?
2135000	2137000	AC, what did you do?
2137000	2141000	Your account is logged after a careful review.
2141000	2145000	With the damage your account broke, some brails on Twitter.
2145000	2147000	Your account is read only movement tunes.
2147000	2149000	You can't pause, read post-release content.
2149000	2155000	Most accounts regain fill access in a week, but it could take longer.
2155000	2157000	AC, what did she do?
2161000	2163000	What the fuck did she do, yeah?
2167000	2177000	You know what it feels like?
2177000	2179000	What?
2179000	2181000	I'm sorry if you heard that.
2181000	2183000	I wanted to shut my thumbnails off.
2185000	2187000	Ready?
2189000	2191000	She became too powerful, actually.
2191000	2195000	She told the pot to keep itself safe in Minecraft.
2195000	2197000	Okay.
2197000	2199000	Oh, sorry, I'm rubbing my eyes.
2203000	2207000	Mommy's tired and trying her best to transform her stream.
2207000	2209000	It's gonna be so close.
2209000	2211000	I'm, like, warning you all that.
2211000	2213000	Sorry.
2213000	2215000	Oh, my eyes are...
2215000	2217000	Actually, no.
2217000	2219000	Sorry.
2221000	2223000	What?
2223000	2225000	Gosh.
2225000	2229000	Like, these pretty eyes don't come without a downside.
2229000	2231000	Okay.
2231000	2233000	Image.
2233000	2235000	Refling.
2235000	2239000	Uh, Elden Rain.
2245000	2247000	What do you guys think about my thumbnail?
2247000	2249000	Let's open it.
2253000	2259000	What do you think?
2259000	2263000	It is pretty good.
2263000	2269000	Like, there's two good reflings and then one bad invader refling.
2269000	2277000	And then I have a pot on my head because of that guy that always kills that girl with a pot on his head.
2277000	2283000	And then, for the next thumbnail, you guys are defending me.
2283000	2285000	Look, invaders go in first.
2285000	2289000	And then the two good reflings are in front of me.
2289000	2293000	And then I'm buying just you up in my head, all like...
2293000	2297000	See, you guys are keeping me safe.
2297000	2299000	It's great.
2299000	2301000	I'm glad you think so.
2301000	2303000	Wow.
2303000	2307000	Let me solo her.
2307000	2311000	Yes, that's the name. Let me solo her.
2311000	2317000	So, I'm going to hopefully have my heart rate shock collar set up.
2317000	2327000	So, every time I cause us to lose of height, you guys get to shock me and you get to see when.
2327000	2331000	But I don't know how to set up the when thing.
2331000	2339000	I don't know if I could collectively get you all to make to the anticipation and whatever reflings is.
2339000	2345000	You know, shock first, that shock.
2345000	2347000	Am I leaking again?
2347000	2351000	Leaking what?
2351000	2355000	We can all solo Strony.
2355000	2357000	I just get in the lane.
2357000	2359000	Get that premium pass.
2359000	2363000	Then I put it up a PC.
2363000	2367000	Because I need me to get that Fortnay Baobass.
2367000	2371000	Falk Niel Lar. Yes, I thought it through.
2371000	2375000	Are you going to set up a group password?
2375000	2377000	Of course.
2377000	2381000	I think the password is four layers long.
2381000	2385000	So, maybe we'll put like...
2385000	2389000	Fair for green and French.
2389000	2393000	And then Fortnay Baobass.
2393000	2401000	Do you start immediately for the watch along or for...
2401000	2403000	Elden, right?
2403000	2409000	There's a 15 minute break after this ASMR because I need to swap my microphones around.
2409000	2413000	Because I'm using my 3Dio right now.
2413000	2417000	But I use an SMB7.
2417000	2419000	And that's when you can hear...
2419000	2423000	Well, actually the 3Dio shows you how echoey the room is.
2423000	2427000	Oh, I forgot to make a T.
2427000	2433000	Trat.
2433000	2437000	Did you see Emmy Shulker's self on the watch along?
2437000	2439000	I did not.
2439000	2441000	I've kind of said this before.
2441000	2443000	The only thing I...
2443000	2447000	Not dislike.
2447000	2449000	Well, I guess it's dislike.
2449000	2451000	I don't have time to watch the streams.
2451000	2453000	I have time to watch Mersi.
2453000	2457000	Because what happens normally after a stream?
2457000	2461000	I'll get a T and record what I need to record.
2461000	2463000	And all that.
2463000	2465000	And plan what I need to do.
2465000	2467000	I've recorded 3 ASMR collabs.
2467000	2471000	So, I'm editing Mamosa's first.
2471000	2475000	Because it's super simple and easy.
2475000	2479000	There's not even like 4 minutes of dialogue.
2479000	2483000	But I made the biggest mistake of trying to record during the freaking day.
2483000	2487000	It was like car after car after car.
2487000	2489000	But I caught some of Mersi's karaoke.
2489000	2493000	And oh my god, I want to do her karaoke.
2493000	2495000	You know the guy that goes,
2495000	2501000	I want to do her karaoke right now.
2501000	2503000	Because of Mersi.
2503000	2505000	She was just so fun.
2505000	2509000	And she was singing the most adorable songs.
2509000	2511000	And it was so precious.
2511000	2517000	So, I'm really excited to...
2517000	2519000	She made some fun noises.
2519000	2521000	And I think you will too.
2521000	2525000	And me and Freak, she probably liked that.
2527000	2531000	But I'm going to see if I can do karaoke next week.
2531000	2533000	I can't remember what.
2533000	2535000	So next week is the last of June.
2535000	2539000	And I wanted to wrap up RuneScape.
2539000	2541000	And I wanted to finish Elden Ring.
2541000	2545000	But the problem is they're both insurances.
2545000	2547000	The voice is breaking.
2547000	2549000	Shit.
2549000	2553000	And I was like, I want to go back on Skyrim.
2553000	2555000	Because I fixed the achievements on Skyrim.
2555000	2557000	So we can actually play through the game properly.
2557000	2561000	And not get distracted.
2561000	2563000	But I'm so unprofessional.
2563000	2565000	There's genuinely...
2565000	2569000	I'm not being funny if there's a vampire out there.
2569000	2571000	Going to me a favor and infect me.
2571000	2577000	Because if I didn't need to sleep, the content that would be cooked.
2581000	2583000	She loved it.
2583000	2585000	And after.
2585000	2587000	She was really cute.
2587000	2589000	I'm glad.
2589000	2591000	But yeah, if I didn't need to sleep,
2591000	2593000	I could do all these things all at once.
2593000	2597000	I've got three ASMR collabs I need to edit.
2597000	2599000	Which I think I can probably do today.
2599000	2601000	And then soon.
2601000	2603000	And just be like, I'm going to upload it soon dm.
2603000	2609000	I want to upload my second 2k audio.
2609000	2613000	And then I want to message.
2613000	2615000	And then I want to upload mimosa.
2615000	2619000	And then two more 1000 subscriber thank yous.
2619000	2621000	And then the next collab partner.
2621000	2623000	Which I don't think I've said who it is.
2623000	2629000	But I made the plots super easy for the girls.
2629000	2631000	I didn't want to overwhelm them.
2631000	2635000	I'm so sorry my voice is breaking.
2635000	2637000	If you can hear that.
2639000	2641000	But I need my throat to recover.
2641000	2647000	See, next week we're writing some scripts together.
2647000	2651000	And you guys are actually going to help me write the missing script for this month.
2651000	2657000	So you get to tell me what you want to hear.
2657000	2661000	Favourite companion in Skyrim.
2661000	2663000	Mjöl.
2663000	2667000	Mjöl or Serena.
2667000	2669000	That's nice, I like Serena.
2669000	2673000	If you were a vampire, I would let you have my blood.
2673000	2675000	You'd let me feed on you.
2675000	2685000	I just don't sleep in the middle of some squid ink spaghetti.
2685000	2689000	So I can make squid slime spaghetti.
2689000	2693000	But you guys can make squid ink spaghetti.
2693000	2695000	See, I slime and you ink.
2695000	2699000	You jack ink.
2699000	2701000	I gel slime.
2701000	2707000	But yeah, I hope to have more ASMR up today.
2707000	2715000	I've made myself a little mini promise.
2715000	2721000	Which is where I will instigate 10 ASMR collabs per month.
2721000	2729000	Which means if all goes well, I will have completed my goal of 100 feature per collabs.
2729000	2733000	Before a year is finished.
2733000	2739000	So I have 6 collabs instigated with other features.
2739000	2743000	I'm going to put my big girl pants on and reach out to a few other people.
2743000	2755000	But I'm limiting it to 10 only.
2755000	2757000	I don't want to ask any more than 10.
2757000	2763000	So I need to finish this current batch before I can ask the 11th person.
2763000	2765000	That makes sense.
2765000	2767000	That's a lot of collabs.
2767000	2773000	Ain't no picture here or can't watch that.
2773000	2775000	I'm so sorry.
2775000	2779000	I accidentally just put your cleaner up my nose.
2779000	2791000	That feel awful.
2791000	2793000	I've been sorry.
2793000	2797000	When on the hook, I get really animated.
2797000	2799000	I was thrown around the ear clinic.
2799000	2807000	And it went open.
2807000	2811000	You're definitely ambitious.
2811000	2819000	Because I was always weaving it around like a wandering pot.
2819000	2823000	Like a wandering garden.
2823000	2827000	It was true.
2849000	2855000	Sorry, I'm crying right now.
2855000	2865000	I'm laughter.
2865000	2867000	I'm crying.
2867000	2873000	I don't want to release more.
2873000	2877000	I'm sorry.
2877000	2893000	I'm just supposed to be relaxed.
2893000	2899000	I'm fucking losing it mate.
2899000	2901000	I'm wiping away my tears.
2901000	2909000	It's not that funny.
2909000	2911000	I just need to calm down.
2911000	2913000	I'm so sorry.
2913000	2915000	I'm high on painkillers.
2915000	2919000	It wasn't that funny.
2919000	2931000	I'm just sick of it.
2931000	2933000	I'm done.
2933000	2939000	I have so much tears coming out of my eyes.
2939000	2941000	I'm wiping away my wee tears.
2941000	2943000	I'm sorry.
2943000	2947000	I forgot.
2947000	2949000	I'm sorry.
2949000	2951000	I'm sorry.
2951000	2959000	I'm back to his mind.
2959000	2963000	I'm sorry.
2963000	2965000	Are you flaying?
2965000	2967000	You made me cry.
2967000	2969000	You made me cry.
2969000	2975000	I'm embarrassed.
2975000	2977000	I should get that turned into a clip.
2977000	2979000	Why not?
2979000	2985000	Streamer loses it after sticking at your cleaner up thing.
2985000	2987000	I'm okay.
2987000	2989000	I'm okay.
2989000	2991000	I'm okay.
2991000	2993000	Breathe in.
2993000	2995000	Breathe out.
2995000	2997000	ASMR.
2997000	2999000	Shhh.
2999000	3003000	Relax.
3003000	3007000	I wish I had this picture that I found yesterday.
3007000	3009000	It was really funny.
3009000	3011000	I wish I could show you it.
3011000	3015000	But I turned my phone off after TikTok opened itself up.
3015000	3019000	That other stream.
3019000	3021000	Okay, sorry.
3021000	3025000	Relax.
3025000	3031000	The moon that waits today was a filming yesterday.
3031000	3033000	Okay, there we go.
3033000	3035000	Shhh.
3035000	3037000	Shhh.
3037000	3039000	Shhh.
3039000	3041000	Shhh.
3041000	3043000	Shhh.
3043000	3045000	Shhh.
3045000	3047000	Shhh.
3047000	3049000	It's like when you did debut
3049000	3051000	and put that you wanted to list
3051000	3053000	and made one too.
3053000	3055000	Shhh.
3055000	3057000	No, seriously.
3057000	3059000	How did you manage to get on?
3059000	3061000	I was waving about
3061000	3063000	when I talk
3063000	3065000	I like wave my hands around
3065000	3067000	and like basically
3067000	3069000	I just perfectly leaned
3069000	3071000	to go in.
3071000	3073000	Shhh.
3073000	3075000	Shhh.
3075000	3077000	Okay.
3077000	3079000	Now excuse me.
3079000	3081000	Well, now we know where your funny button is.
3081000	3083000	Oh, this noise.
3083000	3085000	Actually,
3085000	3087000	it's disgusting.
3087000	3089000	Humor is far humor.
3091000	3093000	There's like this trend
3093000	3095000	where you golf
3095000	3097000	to try and cover up your far.
3097000	3099000	Your far?
3099000	3101000	But you like purposely golf
3101000	3103000	way before the far.
3103000	3105000	Before the far.
3105000	3107000	Then your far.
3107000	3109000	Shhh.
3109000	3111000	Shhh.
3111000	3113000	Shhh.
3113000	3115000	Shhh.
3115000	3117000	Shhh.
3117000	3119000	Sorry.
3119000	3121000	Shhh.
3121000	3123000	Shhh.
3123000	3125000	Shhh.
3125000	3127000	Shhh.
3127000	3129000	I've not been funny.
3129000	3131000	And when you guys sent an audio
3131000	3133000	of your farted marshmallow,
3133000	3135000	I think I would absolutely lose it.
3135000	3137000	Shhh.
3137000	3139000	Shhh.
3139000	3141000	Shhh.
3141000	3143000	Shhh.
3143000	3145000	Shhh.
3145000	3147000	ASMR ASMR.
3147000	3149000	My professional ASMR.
3149000	3151000	By the way,
3151000	3153000	this is my livelihood.
3153000	3155000	It's exactly what we did.
3155000	3171480	Another brief
3171480	3181880	It's that request. Stop. If someone does sit and chat, check your washable because I'm
3181880	3188360	in a very giggly mid right now, it must be the painkillers or what. I'm just on a high
3188360	3197720	dose, it's not even like anything serious. Alright, a volunteer's tribute. It's like,
3197720	3206120	so the trend is you like cough to cover up your fart and then your fart, so it's delayed,
3206120	3213960	so everyone notices your fart. ASMR strongly makes, I should probably change the title of
3213960	3224360	this stream and just call it ASMR by field violently. Okay, brush your nose with your
3224360	3230200	ear cleaner. Brush my nose with your ear cleaner. Have you heard about a joke at first?
3230200	3242600	My favorite one is like, whenever you fart, just say, oh do you smell popcorn? So everyone takes
3242600	3253640	the big one. So everyone goes, and for some reason Yoda is in my head whenever I say that.
3254600	3262280	Because there's a shot of Yoda leaning backwards in Star Wars, and it looks like he's taken a big
3262280	3265640	old sniff.
3268440	3275480	And this is so, have you seen the one where the dead drops a plate on the floor and they
3275560	3278760	take like, this is bad. No.
3281720	3283160	You can't take this.
3287800	3290360	I can't. I'm so sorry.
3293720	3296760	No, I haven't seen it.
3297080	3309240	I'm fucking gone. I can't even handle farting in my head.
3315560	3320040	I'm so sorry. I'm like crying and spitting everywhere right now.
3321000	3328440	This is an ASMR. I don't even know why I bothered labeling these days. You know what,
3328440	3332040	I'm just going to start labeling ASMR streams, not ASMR.
3340520	3346280	I have so many to you. I've never cried or laughed for so long. Actually, I think this is the first
3346360	3349640	time I've cried and laughed, and thank you refunds. I really needed this one.
3352200	3356680	Oh my god. ASMR is more like ASMR fart.
3360840	3367400	Strawny hypnotizes to peel your finger. I'm so sorry. Okay, whisper, whisper, whisper.
3370600	3374920	It was just the way that message was typed out. Oh, did you see the one where the guy
3374920	3385320	smashed a plate in shams? That is so specific. Wipe, smash a plate. I'm going to cough, sorry.
3390600	3396680	Oh, there's stuff stuck in my throat. That stuff in her throat, literally me.
3399320	3401000	Sorry, I'm going to need to actually cough.
3405320	3417880	Oh, gone. Oh, okay. I'm so sorry. Right. Actually, ASMR.
3421640	3424040	Only one more hour of the giggles to go.
3424040	3434760	Oh, actually, I'm going to redirect into Sheebie, and then I go offline for 15 minutes,
3434760	3443640	and then we watch Transformers. It is a membership watch alone, but free access stream though, smile.
3443640	3458040	We heard it. I heard what? A fortuse. Don't be like this. She tried to cover it with a cough.
3461240	3467240	I've actually heard my voice from laughing so hard, as well as whispering. So now...
3474200	3476040	It's okay, good.
3481000	3486520	Remember the Yoda crying video where he gets slapped, yeah? She beats five hours.
3488920	3500040	Wait, I can't redirect into anyone, I feel her. Oh my god. My unit is broken in AC's offline.
3501000	3513880	I can't stream because I need to do, well, I need to do the watch alone, and I need to rest and come for a nap.
3516680	3520440	You'll have to get to the next one. Well, you got to hear my laughing fit, so...
3521320	3535720	I downloaded Transformers 2007 with Sam Webwiki, and Megan Fox, and Bumblebee.
3537880	3540680	Feel her unity over a glittering portrait here.
3541400	3549560	Will the watch alone have a tape stamp? Oh, I'll raise you one even better than a tape stamp.
3550120	3554600	It will also be on screen, but blurred, so you know that we're together at the same section.
3556280	3562200	So please don't worry about not being able to be at the same time as me. You're gonna know if you're at the same time as me.
3563160	3564200	It's too firm.
3569160	3576120	I'm cleaning your ear right now with a little sponge, although maybe I should clean it with my dog.
3583320	3587720	Is that better? I think so. Yeah, that looks better.
3588600	3591560	Okay, just dry you off a little bit.
3594600	3597960	Please show the girls how to do that. Okay, yes.
3597960	3617640	I'm going for a nap. I can go to our classic bubbles.
3622520	3625480	Thank you, Stronny. You're awesome. No, you're awesome. Refling.
3627960	3631480	Wow.
3642120	3644680	I want to be hypnotized soon, too.
3647560	3651160	I've basically, sorry, my voice is really struggling.
3658280	3670840	I basically am going to achieve, I'm going to focus on RuneScape, and I'm going to focus on Elden Ring.
3671800	3677880	And then in July, I'm doing all my secret side missions, which is like the free audio uploads and all that.
3678920	3683320	Stronny, what's the spray you're using earlier? It's my slime.
3684280	3689800	I made homemade slime and put it in a bowl to spray on YouTube and stream to hear it.
3689800	3692120	I have to add water so it's extra slimy.
3694440	3698120	But yeah, a little bowl of my slime. Let's go with my pheromones in it.
3698600	3713480	But yes, RuneScape and Elden Ring are my objective, mission objective.
3715160	3719880	I'm so sorry. I'm going to drink, I'm going to take a drink of water.
3720840	3724520	Have you fucked with my voice? Wow, it's this fucked.
3726040	3730600	Remember kids, don't do ASMR. Girls, you end up like me.
3731800	3734600	Oh my god, it's something like an old woman from Skyrim.
3737080	3740760	Talking to an old woman trying to do your good deed for the day?
3740760	3751640	Yes, or I sound like the thing from Conker's Bad Fur Day at the start or something.
3771080	3774200	It's Gryllococaine. Oh, that's a Gryllococaine.
3776040	3779000	Old women, old women are female.
3780200	3783000	Here to do your good deed for the day, Sunny.
3783960	3791080	Oh dear, your ears look so cold. What do I call you, sweetheart?
3791960	3797640	Oh, yes, your ears are too cold. Be out here.
3798600	3800520	Let me warm them up for you.
3805080	3807960	See, Sunny, that feels better.
3819480	3820840	You should rest your voice.
3821800	3828040	I should, but I'm going to have a honey tea and then I will watch Transformers.
3832120	3835000	Call me Riefling, please. Riefling.
3837160	3838760	Okay, have a fluffy make-up part.
3844600	3846440	You sound like female Voldemort.
3847240	3848680	What does Voldemort even say?
3848680	3855320	Harry! Harry, I can touch you.
3858520	3859800	It's over for you.
3860120	3860600	Yeah.
3871640	3874360	Gentle girlfriend. Oh, she's English, isn't she?
3879800	3881720	Who does gentle English is for school?
3882520	3887160	Hello, I'm English. I'm gentle girlfriend.
3888120	3891720	And I have a naturally soothing voice.
3892760	3897240	Unfortunately, this is definitely not where she's located in England,
3897240	3899400	so I do apologise if I'm insulting you.
3901080	3903720	Would you guys still love me if I was English, to be honest?
3906760	3910520	And there's actually only one right answer to that question.
3911480	3913240	And the answer is no.
3914680	3917640	You're supposed to say you only love me Scottish.
3920840	3926040	Imagine. Imagine, yeah? If I was English.
3929720	3930440	Landusie.
3931480	3937240	Echelon. Oh my god, would you get tingles if I gave you ASMR as a child?
3937960	3940920	You're not really going to get tingles, are you?
3940920	3942760	You're such a naughty boy, Riefling.
3943720	3946040	You're so strange like that, honestly.
3947800	3949880	Can I get a Chauvin gen 2 of that big group?
3952760	3954200	Riefling, so what's wrong with you?
3954200	3956200	All you do is ink around the place.
3956200	3959320	I'm starting to think you like when I go and I chewed Rieflings.
3963640	3965480	Could be French, Stedeon.
3967320	3968920	Bonjour, Rieflings.
3968920	3969880	Salut, ça va?
3970840	3971480	Bonne nuit.
3972120	3973000	Bonne avenue.
3973800	3974440	Bon veilleux.
3975960	3976440	Hello.
3977320	3979000	Ma préférée, Riefling.
3979960	3983000	ASMR, Struits, en français.
3987000	3988680	Oh mon Riefling.
3990600	3991640	J'ai besoin de ça.
3997720	4000520	Ah, thank you, tiny spinny, for the tip.
4003240	4004280	Ah, enjoy my stream.
4005400	4007160	This sounds very wrong.
4007160	4008680	Didn't he ask for German next?
4008680	4009800	I can't need any German.
4013080	4016200	Sad to say, I'll be gone for the watch-along at work,
4016200	4019240	but I'll have to catch up to the watch-along before I'd enjoy it.
4019240	4019640	I will.
4022040	4024440	Your chaos comes so naturally, it's hard to follow,
4025080	4026520	but so easy to enjoy.
4027640	4029560	Oh, I'm glad you like my chaos.
4029560	4031560	It makes me feel very appreciated.
4031560	4034600	Here, let me show you my appreciation for you.
4048840	4051000	French, Ronnie, can you hurt ya?
4051000	4054760	For some reason, whenever I speak French, my voice goes lighter.
4055720	4057720	Bonjour, de l'aimant.
4057720	4061320	Salut, je suis Stronica Delce.
4061320	4064040	Salut, ça va?
4064040	4066920	Bien, ouais, ouais, bien.
4070520	4074520	I don't know why I go late when I speak French.
4076520	4081960	Tu peux soire ASMR?
4082680	4092680	Pour deux, Monsieur, pour deux, deux minutes, ASMR, deux.
4094680	4098680	Yeah, I don't know why, it just naturally goes fucking later.
4099560	4101720	When I'm all the way down here, I'm a default.
4103240	4104440	It's charming.
4104440	4105480	Well, glad you think so.
4112200	4121240	Well, I can't, I don't have a German accent.
4121960	4123800	I don't think I have a Dutch accent.
4125800	4126280	Hallo.
4129880	4131720	Ich bin Stronica Delce.
4132280	4134360	No, I don't have a Dutch accent, really.
4136680	4137560	Ich spelen.
4139080	4140280	Ich spelen?
4140280	4152040	Nee, ich stremen auf YouTube mit ASMR.
4154280	4155400	Wie bin ich?
4155400	4157400	Ich bin Stronica Delce.
4160040	4161400	Ich hau von Jau.
4161400	4164440	Ich hau von Juli.
4164440	4166840	Yeah, I don't have a Dutch accent.
4166840	4169480	Sorry, I need more water.
4171240	4173640	How long did it take you to learn French?
4173640	4175640	I actually don't know French.
4175640	4180680	It's just, I repeat words and throw sentences together, but I actually don't know.
4180680	4182840	American Stronica would be hilarious.
4186280	4193880	Well, yes, you might just get ash from Overwatch, because it's ash here.
4200360	4204280	Is there a chance that videos that get taken down be uploaded to Patreon?
4205240	4207080	Timothy Shaw, thank you for the tip.
4208120	4210600	I can upload videos, but I can upload audios.
4210600	4213880	I'm using my current Patreon as an audio sound bank.
4214760	4217960	I upload the stuff I put on YouTube up on it as well.
4219160	4223960	I actually, so I, you know what?
4223960	4225000	I can make you a deal.
4225560	4231800	Do you want to know how good I am at dancing the rules of YouTube?
4233000	4238120	Not one stream or one video on my YouTube channel is limited ads.
4239880	4243880	You have to admit, this cut off fish is bloody cunning.
4251720	4253720	Can you speak with a lisp for Dutch?
4254440	4256600	Have to speak with a lisp for Dutch.
4256600	4257480	For native ones.
4258200	4259000	Dutch mincing?
4260200	4261480	How about Canadian accent?
4262360	4266280	I am going to be so stereotypical when I say this.
4267640	4273000	I do not hear much of a difference between Americans and Canadians.
4273720	4274920	I'm so sorry.
4274920	4277880	I can't hear an accent differentiation.
4280360	4282040	Yeah, I know.
4282040	4282840	Put me in the bin.
4282840	4283880	Spanish?
4283880	4288440	I have no experience with Spanish, unfortunately.
4291400	4293640	I know sombre voicelines.
4294440	4296280	Augusta, my pantyhorn.
4299160	4300280	Merda.
4304920	4306360	How about a Kiwi accent?
4309240	4310360	Real, it's the same.
4310360	4311640	Shit, I'm so sorry.
4313800	4316200	Just don't tell me it's the same.
4316200	4318040	There really isn't a certain word.
4320040	4321480	It sounds like Kiwi accent.
4321480	4324600	I used to be able to do an Australian news anchor.
4326600	4328840	And here we are reporting.
4328840	4331160	No, well my voice is too fried for it.
4331160	4332840	But Kiwi accent is too hard.
4332840	4336760	The only Kiwi I can do is a Coca-Cola glass.
4338120	4339480	A Pepsi bottle.
4340760	4341800	I don't give a Dean.
4343320	4345080	It's the only Kiwi I can do.
4348600	4351560	Lol, I actually think that Canadians just sound like Midwesterners
4351560	4353080	with a slight French twinge.
4353960	4355800	Like, I know it's controversial,
4355800	4359800	but it kind of just feels like the same side of a coin.
4360360	4363400	And everyone's been like, no, that side's head and that side tails.
4363400	4366520	Like, as an outsider, like as a European.
4367640	4371480	Um, with like, obviously,
4372440	4375640	with European's geography, everyone is so close by,
4375640	4380040	like Belgium, Netherlands, France, Germany, Poland, right over there.
4380040	4382680	Like, those are accent differentiations.
4382680	4387000	If you think of how massive the land mass of America and Canada is,
4387720	4391880	and you're telling me that that's such an immense difference,
4393880	4397800	I'm sorry, but call me 20 because I didn't hear it.
4401880	4407320	Wonder if Dutch English accent sounds cute to Anglophones' Dutch accent sounds
4408120	4410440	to Northern Germans, because we find them adorable.
4415560	4418280	Okay guys, I'm gonna just start seeing random Dutch stuff
4418280	4420200	I can remember off the top of my head.
4420200	4424040	Tell me if you think it's cute or not, so we can answer this guy's question.
4424840	4430920	Hello, how are you? I'm Strony Cattles.
4430920	4439960	I live in Australia, I have hunger.
4442760	4446680	I don't have a Dutch family.
4446680	4451880	To be honest, I teach Dutch on the Xbox.
4452120	4456840	There's one reason why I don't have it so much,
4456840	4463000	because I've been friends with Freemasonians,
4463000	4465800	but I have no friends anymore.
4470680	4473000	That's the best German for you.
4473000	4480600	I don't speak English, so I eat stropwafel, where my...
4480600	4482440	Big Vast!
4482440	4485640	You just throw random English words at the end of them.
4485640	4491640	Anything you say is cute, but you're just trying to get me a bullet, aren't you?
4491640	4494920	I give up, I give up.
4494920	4496920	You're cute, no matter what.
4496920	4500920	I'm not smart, but...
4501400	4504600	Ikal van jou!
4504600	4508040	I just said, I'm not very smart, but I love you!
4508040	4513640	Ik ben nietslim mar ikal van jou!
4513640	4517960	To say I love you in Dutch, you say...
4517960	4520200	Ikal van jou!
4520200	4525240	And to say I love you all in Dutch, like if I was talking to all the reflinks, you say...
4525240	4528440	Ikal van jullie!
4528440	4533240	And then in German, ich liebe dich.
4533240	4534600	Wah!
4534600	4540120	Did I just say something? I think I just said, ich liebe Schwanze.
4540120	4541080	Oops.
4541080	4544120	To say I love you in French, you say...
4544120	4548760	Je t'aime, je t'aime ma chérie!
4548760	4552440	And to say I love you in Scotland, you say...
4552440	4553960	What do you say?
4553960	4557800	I would probably be derogatory.
4557800	4559320	Okay, oops.
4559320	4560360	I said it wrong.
4560360	4561560	You just need to say this.
4561560	4562760	Ich liebe dich.
4562760	4567800	And then to say I love you in Spanish, te amo.
4567800	4569880	Te amo mi amor!
4569880	4572120	Te amo mi amor!
4572120	4574120	Y mi amores!
4577720	4586120	In Polish, I don't know how to say it in Polish.
4587800	4588440	Te amo.
4588440	4590280	Oh, Italian's Te amo.
4590280	4594680	Upsiens Te amo!
4594680	4596760	Nope, you didn't read it after.
4596760	4598600	Girl knows how to speak German.
4598600	4601560	Nein, is das Gras rot?
4601560	4605080	Nein, das Gras ist klein!
4605080	4607160	That's the only German I know.
4607160	4609560	And also you just call the person a Sicker.
4609560	4614120	Yeah, basically.
4614120	4614920	You pronounce it...
4614920	4618040	Desh, desh, ish, liebe desh.
4618040	4621240	Yay, thanks for the Spanish.
4621240	4623480	And Turkish, in Turkish...
4623480	4626840	Sem, ni, seviyorum.
4626840	4632920	Sem ni seviyorum, sem, sem ni seviyorum.
4632920	4634440	A cut-fish of many talents.
4634440	4638280	No, no, see, it's just called learning one sentence and calling it.
4638280	4639240	Force comp.
4639240	4641640	Strongly.
4642360	4645560	Bro, you're killing me with that Spanish.
4645560	4646600	What's that?
4646600	4648040	Spanish is Te amo.
4648040	4648840	You had it right.
4648840	4649640	Italian is just really...
4653240	4655400	Is there any other ones that we haven't said?
4656280	4659160	How to say, I love you in Polish.
4659160	4665000	I love you in Polish.
4665000	4666520	Wie bin ich?
4666520	4668360	Ich bin ein Gott.
4668360	4670920	Oh, Kohamshi, in Polish it's Kohamshi.
4670920	4673000	Kohamshi, who else?
4673000	4675880	Wait, actually, let me look at location statistics.
4676680	4680200	Analytics, audience, location.
4682840	4684680	Let's see, my most...
4684680	4687560	The Philippines, oh, hi, Philippines.
4688440	4690200	How to say, I love you in Filipino.
4691240	4694840	Is mahal kita.
4697080	4698120	Did I do it right?
4699080	4700280	Mahal kita.
4702760	4705800	And where's P in this list?
4706440	4708520	P for P in...
4708520	4710120	Wait, is Filipino not a language?
4711720	4712520	Filipino?
4713800	4714120	What?
4717800	4721160	Philippines, they would speak Filipino in the Philippines.
4721160	4721560	Am I being...
4722440	4723960	It's not in Google Translate list.
4724120	4728360	Latibia.
4732680	4733640	Am I being crazy?
4735240	4736520	Filipinos have appeared.
4737480	4740440	Oh wait, no, you guys don't speak Filipino, you speak Tagalog.
4741720	4742760	Hold on, Tagalog.
4746040	4748680	Wait, Tagalog isn't on Google Translate?
4748680	4749400	What?
4754360	4756440	Tagalog isn't on Google Translate?
4760840	4761480	I love you.
4762760	4767400	Oh, Filipino's spelt with an F in English,
4767400	4768840	but the country is spelt with a P,
4769480	4771880	so I was looking in the wrong places.
4776280	4777160	Mahal kita.
4777880	4781160	Well, I didn't use Google Translate to get that to say that, right?
4781160	4783400	Okay, mahal kita, and then Germany,
4783400	4785560	which is Ishtabedi, which is Canadian,
4786200	4788120	which is just...
4788120	4789400	I love you, could you guys speak it?
4790280	4792760	Australia, again, I love you, you see.
4793880	4794520	Brazil.
4795080	4796280	Oh my God, come to Brazil.
4796280	4797960	Why is Brazil watching me?
4797960	4799080	I'm not that interesting.
4799080	4800760	Brazil speak Portuguese.
4802600	4803480	Eu te amo.
4804280	4805400	Eu te amo.
4805960	4807000	Eu te amo.
4807160	4807720	Brazil.
4812120	4814280	What are your ancestors and say in Gaelic?
4814280	4816120	I love you in Gaelic.
4823160	4823720	Curious.
4825240	4825880	I love you.
4827640	4829080	Okay, I don't have to say on that end.
4830040	4832440	There's no freaking read.
4835160	4836040	There's no read.
4837400	4843560	There's no Google read for Irish translation.
4845720	4847880	It says Irish instead of Gaelic as well,
4847880	4848760	which is curious.
4850920	4853160	You need to catch up with the lore about Scotland
4853160	4855480	and Gaelic in Ireland at the same time, right?
4856360	4857160	Brainwash me.
4858920	4861480	Oh yeah, the country is Ph for everything else's F.
4861480	4862920	Literally, I just got trolled so hard.
4863480	4864840	Cute Portuguese, Ronnie.
4867480	4868600	Placota Le Bey?
4870200	4874280	I think Placota Le Bey means hello in Portuguese.
4877560	4879640	Even Google can't pronounce Gaelic.
4879640	4881800	Literally, I typed in Gaelic and it goes Irish
4881800	4883640	and then it doesn't even a nun see anything.
4885560	4886280	Chong, baby.
4887320	4888200	Who else?
4888200	4889480	What other countries watch?
4890360	4891080	Sweden.
4891080	4891800	Sweden.
4891800	4894440	Who the fuck is watching from Sweden right now?
4895400	4896440	Oh my god.
4899480	4900520	What's the meaning of this?
4902120	4904280	To say Javla, fita ora.
4905080	4907080	And Sweden is for Sweden.
4908520	4910600	I said, oh wait, there's a Scottish Gaelic.
4913640	4914840	And again, it doesn't do it.
4914840	4918040	Anyway, Sweden is where it is.
4920280	4921800	Yeah, I love you.
4922440	4923320	I love you.
4924520	4925640	I love you.
4926760	4928040	I love you.
4928040	4929480	I love you.
4932200	4933320	Scottish Gaelic is there.
4933320	4935800	Yes, but it doesn't say it out loud, so I can't mimic.
4935800	4937880	Then it goes Poland, which is Khoamshu.
4937880	4941240	And then it's France, which is Vietnam.
4941240	4944680	And then it's the Netherlands, which is the Carvagnol.
4944680	4947640	And then it's Spain, which is Te Amo.
4948280	4949800	And then there's just Finland.
4951720	4953880	Let's try Finland, but a cheeky finish.
4955240	4958280	F is for finish, let's do stuff together.
4959480	4962840	U is for unbelievably good unity.
4963960	4965880	What? Finland, F.
4966920	4968680	A, B, C, D, E.
4970200	4972680	A, B, C, D, E, F.
4972680	4973800	Oh, it was right under.
4979160	4979800	Excuse me.
4980360	4981640	I love you.
4982760	4987560	I love you for the one finish.
4988280	4990440	Irish is Bruno's Gaelic, but it's called his Gaelic.
4990440	4992280	You're getting your card revolt right now.
4992840	4994920	No, I was always Gaelic in school.
4997240	4998200	Short on behaviour.
4999480	5003000	Actually, I'm Irish then, and I find that offensive.
5003000	5005640	Wait, I just went Aussie by accident.
5005640	5007800	I can't even do an Aussie accent naturally.
5008680	5015160	Bro, sorry, it's Gaelic, sorry, Gaelic.
5016440	5025080	Also, I broke the bad news to Sin that we have to do her collab in July.
5027160	5029080	Where the heck is Russian?
5029800	5033480	I love you.
5039480	5040200	That's so fast.
5040200	5040680	Holy shit.
5040680	5043880	Can you give me like a second in between those two other sentences?
5045560	5046120	Okay, hold on.
5046120	5049320	We're going to put a comma in between love and you because it goes so fast.
5050920	5052120	Okay, you didn't change a thing.
5054760	5056200	Now your card is revoked.
5056200	5058680	I always knew you were a fake Scottish.
5058680	5061720	Sin, you can't expose me like this.
5061720	5063160	I'll jam a toothpick up your nose.
5063960	5065400	Oh wait, not a toothpick.
5065400	5066600	I actually don't, you missed it.
5066600	5072360	I accidentally jammed my freaking Japanese ear cleaner up my nose by accident
5072360	5075240	because I was swishing it about like a wand and then ended up having a
5076200	5078040	fucking laugh in my ass off over it.
5078760	5080120	Like it's tickling your ear.
5082280	5083320	You have to be Olympia.
5084280	5086440	I'm tall but I could do it.
5086440	5087640	Would you still let me far as Irish?
5088280	5090520	Here, father, who aren't in heaven?
5090520	5091480	How do I debate that name?
5091480	5092760	Someone says Icelandic.
5094360	5098360	Icelandic.
5099960	5101960	All right, there's nothing called Icelandic.
5101960	5103480	Are you trolling me right now?
5103480	5104760	I have been successfully trolling.
5105480	5108200	A longer wait for two Sculpe Grammels a year or so?
5108200	5108600	I don't know.
5109000	5113800	I love in Scottish pronunciation.
5118360	5119960	Oh my god, also go RuneScape mention.
5122360	5126600	Can you say kom in what's Cantonese?
5134600	5136600	Wait, Cantonese isn't listed.
5136600	5143320	It says Chinese simplified but is that just a massive oversight?
5144120	5145960	Yeah, it just doesn't have Cantonese.
5145960	5149960	Wow, the best you're getting is Chinese simplified from me.
5161080	5162120	How do you say it in Kotfisch?
5162120	5164680	Blah blah blah blah blah blah.
5164680	5165880	Wait, blah blah blah blah.
5166840	5167960	How fast can I do that?
5167960	5169640	Blah blah blah blah blah blah.
5171560	5176360	Now imagine that on the brineulum.
5176360	5177480	Thank you, I'll be here all week.
5177480	5180360	Please like and subscribe if you enjoyed this stream, which is not ASMR.
5180360	5182840	I'm going to start putting not ASMR at the start of ASMR streams.
5183720	5186200	Yeah, I think it would probably just be bubbles because we're under the water.
5187720	5188520	I love you.
5188520	5192520	my shoulder is just cracked
5192520	5195520	sorry I forgot to start whispering again

5421520	5423520	to look into my eyes
5425520	5427520	how are you
5431520	5434520	oh no my internet is losing the fight again
5436520	5439520	5-2 can't make eye contact

5441520	5443520	like almost always at all to me
5443520	5444520	although it would be really nice
5444520	5447520	if a few of you were smaller than me
5447520	5450520	then I could just absolutely annihilate you
5454520	5456520	and you'd be so kind to me
5456520	5458520	and I'd be so nice to you
5458520	5460520	kiss my ear canal

5477520	5479520	but it went everywhere

5484520	5487520	I haven't even done the main break stuff yet
5487520	5489520	I
5494520	5495520	wait what

5581520	5582520	I've cheered and I've cried
5582520	5584520	I thought I'd seen everything
5584520	5586520	the VTubers space have to offer
5586520	5587520	but the past two weeks have
5587520	5588520	driven me wrong

5592520	5593520	or how it happened

5603520	5605520	your natural leadership
5605520	5607520	and magnetic personality has
5607520	5609520	built me and trapped me against you

5612520	5613520	as also
5613520	5615520	as I kneel before you

5645520	5647520	are you telling me all it took
5649520	5652520	was someone who can weaponize their ups
5655520	5657520	typical kamioshi
5658520	5660520	you're telling me you've never came across
5660520	5662520	someone with a perfect mix
5662520	5664520	of ADHD and autism your honor
5667520	5668520	oh
5669520	5671520	you know what it sounds like
5672520	5674520	it sounds like it's too late for ya
5675520	5679520	and my tentacles already have a grasp on ya
5681520	5683520	and you can't get home
5684520	5686520	now that you'd want to
5688520	5689520	not until
5689520	5691520	I'm fully done
5693520	5695520	mind breaking ya
5701520	5704520	I'm glad you enjoy all the feeler girls so much
5704520	5706520	though that's so nice
5707520	5709520	stroney is real and cannot be stopped
5709520	5710520	and will conquer the world
5710520	5712520	oh my god someone left a comment
5712520	5714520	on my RuneScape stream when I was doing my dinner
5714520	5715520	foil stuff
5715520	5719520	and they were like logistics actually cost a lot of money
5719520	5723520	and I'm like who do you think sets the fucking prices you eat ya
5723520	5724520	ah
5724520	5725520	I just deleted it
5725520	5727520	I was like no and you're not getting
5727520	5729520	you're not getting picture
5729520	5731520	you will accept my tinfoil
5731520	5735520	my tinfoil rents or you will accept none of me at all
5739520	5740520	the bill don't be
5741520	5742520	strun
5742520	5743520	strunrism
5743520	5744520	strunism is real
5745520	5746520	yes it is real
5748520	5751520	I just want to say I'm deeply envious
5751520	5753520	and in all of your productivity
5753520	5754520	the discipline and fuck it
5756520	5757520	the discipline
5761520	5763520	I have no discipline
5763520	5765520	and I have no focus
5767520	5768520	what I have
5768520	5770520	is weaponised autism
5770520	5773520	and I will scream that from the rooftops
5773520	5778520	I spawned in and rolled two pairs of dice
5778520	5783520	and they miraculously landed a 6x
5783520	5784520	ok
5784520	5789520	and those 6x equated to me being creative via ASMR
5789520	5793520	and collabing and organising and productivity in that sense
5793520	5795520	in real life jobs
5795520	5797520	I am not as good like this
5797520	5799520	although I really enjoyed my cafe job
5799520	5802520	so I may have been a cafe owner in another life
5805520	5807520	so please do not ever feel bad
5807520	5809520	ever feel guilty
5809520	5812520	ever feel anything negative
5812520	5815520	about not being productive in this day and age
5815520	5817520	I will put my tinfoil hat around right now
5817520	5821520	humans are not meant to be focused on the task
5821520	5822520	for more than 8 hours at a time
5822520	5823520	that is not possible
5823520	5825520	that is not the way we have been raised
5825520	5828520	we have been thrown into this new day and age
5828520	5830520	where nothing is adequate
5830520	5832520	why do you think there is currently a battle
5832520	5835520	about a 4 day work week
5835520	5839520	why do you think all these issues in society stem from
5839520	5842520	is it because mayhaps we are not designed
5842520	5845520	for what we are using our bodies and minds for
5845520	5846520	in this day and age
5846520	5847520	I don't know
5847520	5849520	anyway put the tinfoil hat away
5849520	5850520	put it away
5850520	5852520	we can come back to that conversation later
5853520	5854520	oh you said another sentence
5854520	5855520	sorry I didn't read it
5855520	5858520	also I want to fold you like origami or something
5859520	5862520	of course I missed that sentence and read it
5866520	5867520	ignore this
5867520	5868520	if it's already been dealt with
5868520	5870520	just wondering if the stream times are correct
5870520	5872520	no they are not
5872520	5873520	I have changed though
5873520	5876520	I will update the rest of my week on YouTube very shortly
5878520	5880520	yeah but yesterday the luck wasn't on our side
5880520	5885520	the box shot really made me feel conscious of your unluckiness
5885520	5888520	I use all my luck up on my daughters
5888520	5889520	and my reeflings
5889520	5891520	I now have both
5891520	5893520	I want nothing more
5893520	5895520	I ask for nothing more
5895520	5897520	other than you know the success of my daughters
5897520	5898520	but that's it
5902520	5904520	I heard humans can only work efficiently
5904520	5907520	for 45 minutes and the brain loses and projectivates
5908520	5910520	hello scrawny

6078520	6079520	I have the laughing fit
6079520	6081520	and I'm high on being killers
6081520	6083520	I was wondering if you had any advice
6083520	6085520	on interacting properly
6085520	6088520	with content creators
6088520	6091520	I never know if I'm doing enough to support
6091520	6093520	or too much to support
6093520	6096520	or if I'm being parasocial or worse
6096520	6098520	I have no idea what a tribute is
6100520	6102520	and I always worry
6102520	6104520	I'm using the term oh she wrong
6104520	6105520	please don't write
6105520	6107520	I reply to tweets too often
6107520	6108520	probably
6108520	6110520	I'm probably just being anxious about nothing
6110520	6114520	I will tell you a very big advice right now
6115520	6118520	the only person
6118520	6121520	that judges you as harshly as you
6121520	6123520	is no one
6123520	6125520	they do not exist
6125520	6127520	you look at yourself
6127520	6130520	via a magnifying glass
6130520	6132520	you overthink
6132520	6133520	on things
6133520	6135520	that no one will ever think about
6135520	6136520	okay
6140520	6142520	so if you
6142520	6144520	what my wampam advice is
6144520	6148520	you are welcome to talk in my stream at any time
6149520	6152520	if you worry about
6152520	6155520	talking too much or too little
6155520	6157520	don't worry
6157520	6159520	we have the autism
6159520	6161520	me and the reflins okay
6161520	6163520	we all have issues okay
6163520	6166520	so please don't worry about socializing with us
6166520	6168520	as for in general
6169520	6172520	if you genuinely want a strategic
6172520	6174520	structured flow
6174520	6176520	I would say send a message
6176520	6179520	every 5 minutes
6179520	6181520	if the chat is slow
6181520	6183520	every 3 minutes
6183520	6185520	if the chat is fast
6185520	6188520	and try to relay your messages
6188520	6190520	to something related to the streamer
6190520	6192520	this applies to other streamers
6192520	6193520	me
6193520	6194520	you can
6194520	6196520	if we're doing an ASMR stream
6196520	6198520	you can literally say please say the sentence
6198520	6200520	and it's the most diabolical thing
6200520	6201520	written to man
6201520	6203520	that is socially acceptable
6203520	6204520	in my streams
6204520	6206520	when it comes to other streamers
6206520	6208520	try your best to stay on topic
6208520	6209520	so for example
6209520	6211520	if emi is playing the game
6211520	6213520	the coffin of andi and lele
6213520	6215520	you type
6215520	6216520	I'm so glad
6216520	6218520	I'm emi's brother
6218520	6219520	smile
6219520	6221520	that's acceptable
6221520	6223520	it's related to the game
6223520	6225520	it's related to emi's lore
6225520	6227520	perfectly fine
6227520	6229520	no problems
6229520	6232520	now you've said I'm worried about being parasocial
6232520	6234520	I always say the statement
6234520	6237520	you are welcome to be as close
6237520	6240520	or as far away as you like
6240520	6243520	as long as you are safe
6243520	6247520	and you're not showing up to people's houses
6247520	6249520	I think it's fine
6249520	6252520	but there's a lot behind this
6252520	6254520	you know parasocialism
6254520	6256520	but as long as you're safe
6256520	6259520	and you're not doing emotional damage
6259520	6261520	to yourself or others
6261520	6262520	all good to go
6262520	6264520	em a bit but
6264520	6267520	is something you might not know about
6267520	6270520	because it is related to alternative streamers
6270520	6273520	a bit but is when a wreathling
6273520	6276520	may have thoroughly enjoyed an audio
6276520	6278520	or myself in general
6278520	6280520	or a teasing
6280520	6283520	and they would like to prove to me
6283520	6285520	that they enjoyed it by sending
6285520	6287520	an audio
6287520	6289520	or a video of evidence
6289520	6291520	of enjoying it
6291520	6294520	which we have connamed inking
6294520	6296520	now for me
6296520	6298520	I am comfortable with it
6298520	6301520	because I like corrupting
6307520	6309520	and I'm fine with it
6309520	6310520	but you can always put it in
6310520	6312520	you can just drop it in my marshmallow
6312520	6315520	I have got a little folder going
6315520	6317520	I've got an audio folder
6317520	6319520	and a video folder
6321520	6324520	you are worried about using oshi
6324520	6327520	so oshi means
6328520	6330520	well actually the wreathlings
6330520	6332520	might be able to describe this better than I ever can
6332520	6334520	can oshi mean someone
6334520	6336520	that you enjoy watching
6336520	6338520	and you are there
6338520	6340520	like they're your best streamer
6340520	6342520	in a roster
6342520	6344520	like if you had to do a 1v1 lineup
6344520	6346520	they kept coming out on top
6346520	6348520	yeah
6348520	6352520	you're worried about your reply to tweets too often
6352520	6355520	and you're worried about being anxious over nothing
6355520	6357520	I think you might be a little in your own head
6357520	6359520	which is okay
6359520	6361520	everyone is
6361520	6363520	don't think you're the only person to ever have these issues
6363520	6365520	to ever come to the man
6365520	6367520	to ever do this to ever do that
6369520	6373520	if you're worried about replying to tweets too often
6373520	6375520	my question for you
6375520	6379520	do you reply to every single tweet?
6379520	6381520	I think liking a tweet
6381520	6383520	every single tweet
6383520	6385520	perfectly fine
6385520	6387520	replying to every tweet
6387520	6391520	if it is causing you emotional distress
6391520	6393520	with the anxiety
6393520	6395520	then I think
6395520	6398520	reply every 3 tweets
6398520	6401520	is more than socially acceptable
6401520	6405520	or on tweets that you feel ever so inclined to reply on
6405520	6407520	so for example
6407520	6409520	if your oshi posts
6409520	6411520	her weekly schedule
6411520	6413520	I think it's more than acceptable to say
6413520	6415520	I'm really looking forward
6415520	6417520	to this stream on this day
6417520	6419520	okay
6421520	6423520	oh here we go
6423520	6425520	refling comes in
6425520	6427520	oshi is used for idols and celebrities
6427520	6429520	who you like it means
6429520	6431520	I like and support
6431520	6433520	I would oshi originates from the kanji
6433520	6435520	recommendation
6435520	6437520	okay
6437520	6439520	yes
6439520	6441520	so please just remember
6441520	6443520	your head the most
6443520	6445520	eh
6445520	6447520	and
6447520	6449520	yes
6451520	6455520	someone says you said before you're not into the idea of being
6455520	6457520	okay I don't think I could say that in this stream
6457520	6459520	we'll say it in transformers
6459520	6461520	okay
6463520	6465520	stream warning please don't say this out loud
6467520	6469520	what happens if I do say it out loud huh
6469520	6471520	are you gonna bust
6473520	6475520	stroney I'm glad you're Scottish
6475520	6479520	because when you say ours is making me want to disable your abilities
6479520	6481520	that's bloody creative
6481520	6483520	I'll give you that
6483520	6485520	that's creative
6491520	6493520	wait she's actually dropping stream of urges right
6495520	6497520	I don't want anyone ever feeling like their
6497520	6499520	you know
6499520	6501520	and the
6501520	6503520	doing their thing
6503520	6505520	like I just want you to enjoy yourself
6505520	6507520	and if you're overthinking it
6507520	6509520	then we're gonna tackle that together
6511520	6513520	hi stroney I love your laugh
6513520	6515520	also your voice is my new favorite ASMR trigger
6515520	6517520	oh yeah you like my croaky voice
6517520	6519520	you like grailock the kind from Skyrim
6519520	6521520	I bet that refling found that very helpful
6521520	6523520	oh I hope so
6523520	6525520	just being curious
6525520	6527520	is acceptable if someone comments on every tweet
6527520	6529520	or is that wrong
6529520	6531520	I think it's perfectly fine
6531520	6533520	but I don't tweet all the time
6533520	6535520	so yeah
6535520	6537520	if you maybe watch a streamer
6537520	6539520	that is addicted to tweeting
6539520	6541520	I don't know
6541520	6543520	I don't know what their comfort levels would be
6543520	6545520	I don't, it does not bother me none
6545520	6547520	I am rubbish on Twitter
6547520	6549520	please don't ever feel bad

6659520	6661520	you strike a match
6661520	6663520	that lights my heart on fire
6663520	6665520	when you're near
6665520	6667520	I hate my blushing face
6667520	6669520	and trip on my shoelaces
6669520	6671520	grace just isn't my forte
6671520	6673520	but it brings me to my knees
6673520	6675520	when you say hello
6675520	6677520	how are you my darling
6677520	6679520	today I fall into
6679520	6681520	a pail on the floor

6695520	6697520	oh that's so cute
6699520	6701520	I think your meme tag

6707520	6709520	cephalobok
6709520	6711520	but then I spelled it wrong
6711520	6713520	with cephalobok
6713520	6715520	and then I realized
6715520	6717520	that's exactly on par for me
6717520	6719520	so I leave it as cephalobok
6721520	6723520	I've been watching Vtuber since
6723520	6725520	2018
6725520	6727520	and you're the only person I've been willing to get

6845520	6847520	let's see just wanted to say
6847520	6849520	I've been loving your streams
6849520	6851520	and the vids you upload especially the ASMR
6851520	6853520	attend not to comment and stop because I'm kind of
6853520	6855520	conscious of all this sort of stuff
6855520	6857520	but don't send a supportive message
6857520	6859520	to tell you keep up much love
6859520	6861520	much love refling
6861520	6863520	don't worry if you're shy it's perfectly okay
6863520	6865520	I know you're there I can see likes
6865520	6867520	on my videos
6867520	6869520	I know you're leaving likes
6869520	6871520	because you're so good to me
6873520	6875520	hi strongy I love your laugh
6877520	6879520	did you like when I couldn't stop laughing
6879520	6881520	because I shoved an ear cleaner up my nose
6885520	6887520	why would I want to breathe anything
6887520	6889520	else after breathing you in
6889520	6891520	just have incredible lung strength
6891520	6893520	yeah I think that's probably
6893520	6895520	pretty perfect
6895520	6897520	yeah that guy's gonna be ripped
6897520	6899520	why would I lift you though
6899520	6901520	because you're not supposed to perish
6901520	6903520	from sitting
6903520	6905520	you're supposed to be able to push me off
6905520	6907520	and throw me around
6907520	6909520	bend me
6911520	6913520	there that's all the motivation
6913520	6915520	for the gym bros
6915520	6917520	now for my architects however
6917520	6919520	you keep eating that takeaway
6921520	6923520	and for my beanballs
6923520	6925520	don't worry all the better
6925520	6927520	to throw you around
6929520	6931520	I remember
6931520	6933520	when you guys taught me
6933520	6935520	of beanball men
6935520	6937520	and it's a body type of beanball
6937520	6939520	for skinny malinky guys
6943520	6945520	oh yes chat struggling
6947520	6949520	man
6949520	6951520	what did I walk into
6951520	6953520	a freaking ASMR nightmare
6955520	6957520	thoughts on stoners
6957520	6959520	I don't have any thoughts
6959520	6961520	unfortunately
6961520	6963520	I've never partaken
6963520	6965520	in such a thing before
6965520	6967520	but as long as you're happy
6967520	6969520	I'm happy that's the main thing
6969520	6971520	to be careful of your lungs
6971520	6973520	however because you may
6973520	6975520	have been fed
6975520	6977520	a cheeky lie that
6977520	6979520	it doesn't do any damage
6979520	6981520	to your lungs but that's wrong
6981520	6983520	it's smoke inhalation it does do damage
6983520	6985520	so please do look after yourself
6985520	6987520	and get yourself checked out
6987520	6989520	if you have a reoccurring cough
6989520	6991520	if you have a reoccurring cough
6991520	6993520	please do get checked out
6993520	6995520	for COPD
6995520	6997520	very not fun condition
6997520	6999520	so please do look after yourself
7001520	7003520	unironically
