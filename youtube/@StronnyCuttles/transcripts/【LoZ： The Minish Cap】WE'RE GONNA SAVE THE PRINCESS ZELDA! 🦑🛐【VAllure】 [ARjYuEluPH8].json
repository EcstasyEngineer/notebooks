{"text": " Wow... Tasting, tasting... My voice is sharp before any... Yes, get excited! Testing... Microphone test... Ah ah, microphone, okay. Audio is a freaking thing. Oh yeah, it's streaming time. Are you guys there? Testing... Oh, YouTube gave me acknowledgement I'm live. Hello... Good morning! Good evening! Good afternoon! How are my little wiflings? Very very sweet! No one is going to get that reference. Good morning! How are you? I'm currently glowing because of the events that occurred last night. After a stream that should not be named. You guys had some very interesting marshmallows for me when I woke up. I do have some good tiny VLR news. AC and Emmys second batch of emotes have been accepted and paid for. So do hold your breath for them. The girls picked what emotes they want and they were very charming. I think they're adorable. Up next is ordering Sheevee and Mersi's emotes. I'm having to do it in batches. The wait time is 30 days. But as soon as they've been accepted it's just something in the background that I don't have to think about. Which is fantastic. I am submitting my emotes last because I know how ever so patient my beautiful wiflings can be. So I do appreciate your patience until the new emotes do show up. We are getting there. We will soon be there. I will do that later. My voice is short unfortunately but hopefully the microphone is covering up the majority of how badly short it is. And I think we're just going for it. We will wait as long as it takes. I think ours are going to show up in like 40 days which is quite a lot. Considering how much mome streams. I'll be a whole second but I mean I see their emotes have been submitted and I get to see the adorable drafts. The mot artist has already worked on them before so it might be a faster process. Question mark. I don't know. I submitted to them the ref sheet. They're all the emotes and what they want here. Time to diminish. No we are going to save. I have a cup of tea. I've got a hot war ball. I may or may not have slapped myself a little too hard but I hope. That phantom we saw earlier. He said he had an ancient king of Hyrule. What else do we know? The element was nowhere to be seen in the wind runes. I guess we'll just have to go to the place marked on our map. But first you should infuse your sword with that element. Right okay. We have just picked up the third element. The element of water. Oh the light. The skulls open up. Hello. No. That's right. I knew this was here for a child. Yeah someone was so adorable in message and they were like mome. I'm like yeah. They were like mommy. What hole did you use? My refund. Bless you. Hope. Brained where are you? Did my language not unfair? Where are we going? I was going to say swimming pool. Hi Sony what's the transformers last night? Is this one I've ever had watching a movie? Oh I'm so glad. I actually love doing watch-alongs. Especially like on stuff I've never seen before. Fucking hell it's going to take forever. I'm lucky I picked up a bomb sack honestly. I can't read the site from Marshmallow. I have no clue. If you use firefox there should be a little extension for translation. Unfortunately I don't use anything else but firefox. But I think you can all translate if you try hard enough. Wait I can't... I can't do anything can I? I can only get this. Well oh well we got 100 for that. Oh we can go buy an upgrade on something. Yeah we cannot do anything. There's something to the bomb we can do unfortunately. I'm not sure what that is. We're currently just exploring because we've got access to the... Oh no they're having to do a time crunch. Chomp chomp. I'm always the last to finish eating. Oh can't really... How about you do you... No no trading. Oops. We're dying. We are very... We are getting very close to finishing the game. As far as I'm aware. I don't have that yet grrr. Alright we can come back another time. Oh there's a big guy up there. Let's go get him. Shonen's always a fed gopher. Let's just let them have people eat slow. You made it here really quickly. You're filled with surprises aren't you? It took me like one third of the game. But sure if you mean getting here quickly. There you go. That's so cute. That looks like... No one wants to trade Kinstone pieces either. And here my food I've got stuff to do. Bruv honestly. Hello thanks everyone for joining. I am not going to even pretend I know what's going on with the schedules. Some people will be online. Some people will be offline. That's it. That's all I know. Don't ask me anymore because I don't know. What do you say? You've played this before. I have. This is a lovely childhood game of mine. Oh we can give these girls houses. Who do we think is the best here? Do we do the green bunches? Come on green bunches. Yeah give us green bunches. No there's something really annoying about this little side quest we're about to do okay? There will always be one girl that doesn't have a house because they didn't call to end. It's annoying. Shira Fanta Fusion Ward. Well I've just had the best idea. I can rent out my house for some extra cash. No not long lords simulator. We can't escape. You've made a perfect match. Singing in forever. What a bother. It's so nice to be here at last. We need to find a place to quiet and down. It's so nice to be here at last in such a big townhouse. Are these maybe they're a reference to another Zelda game? So now he can rent out but we need to find someone. What do you want? Why are you bothering me? Oh my name is Gorman. I'm trying to hand in real estate. Turns out I'm a total pain. It's a total pain right now. I'm looking for a 10 and you see the thing is I can only rent to a wimp. Do you guys remember that reddit post that went semi viral? Where the guy was like looking for a roommate. But you wouldn't have to pay if you're a woman. You'd just have to give up the goods basically. Yeah I don't know if you guys remember that but I do. And it was pretty wild. You found me a house yesterday. Go rent. Oh I remember that. Yes. Okay I knew I wasn't the one that knew about it. That was legit. It was pretty nice. Right we actually can get access to the rooftop now. Once we pick up the last item we're going to do a massive amount of exploring. Because you want to make sure you get naturally due. Is that supposed to be the lead? No it's not. So my update last night. Yeah last night I was doing my research about this game. No chance. I don't think I can play sub six and make it interesting. I'm going to be honest. I don't think I can make it interesting. Strongest, strongest, strongest explorer. Oh does he want to teach me anything here? Hello. Come again when you can jump further. I never believed Sivir's your kind of game. It would be fun to just be like scorching it but... Wait is this going to give me like 50 bombs then? That's a big bomb bag. Well you are a big spender thank you. It does! It gives me 50 so I'm going to have 50 arrows as well. Okay okay. I assume the shield doesn't actually give me... You already have a fine shield. Yeah I was going to say. We already have one I'm not sure. No one seems to want to fuse Kinstone pieces. Have I like done everyone? I think I might have done everyone in town. Strongest big spender and she can handle deposit. Hope you're having a good day. Yeah I'm having a cheeky slow morning. I've got my cup of tea. I'm just letting it cool down a little bit. We'll go at the Castello and upgrade our equipment. We can... Oh look at that. Zoom in. Absolutely zoom in. I think it would be... It's a group club idea. They do an endurance club by each other and so... Unfortunately the girls can't do that because they need to move out. Or their parents are going to come flying in the room and be like, Shut up! I love hedges! I love gardening! It's saving me from the snake! That's kind of the problem. That's why I'm always like, Please support the girls because we have plans of moving to better locations and stuff. I knew gardening would pay off. How long is stream today? I don't know. It depends how much time we piss off about. Wow! I actually don't know how much longer. Lore-wise? We only have one more item to unlock. You're in presence of the true master, Grimblade. If you train me, you become a master. Would you like to train? Yes please. I think we've only got like four more hours of gameplay. To learn the meaning of the power of this technique, you start with first, second, third. Yeah, sure. I was listening. But this is only the beginning. It comes to real thing. You must feel the technique. That's why I will never possess your body. With the Grimblade possession technique. Watch this! Position! No, I think it will be like four hours. Oh wow, I can like shoot. You must try it yourself. When you're... Oh, that's such a good thing. Oh. No way! I just like straight up have a laser beam now. Do you teach me anymore? You're awesome. Can you teach me more? No, there's nothing more I can teach you. But that's pretty cool. If I'm full health, I have a bullet now. Possession. We refuse this forbidden stream allegation. Oh my god. I don't want to know the allegation. Them allegunkns. I was outrageous that stream. But for anyone that gets annoyed with me going bit, bit, bit for all the bees. I visit her every hour to have much to offer but you're welcome to stay. Stop! They're so cute and humble. The stream didn't even get limited ads even though the context of the stream is absolutely outrageous. Oh, the falling trees up. You can visit the Swordmaster at the lake. Did I not? Did we not go back? I thought we went back. YouTube ads are such a working system. Are you guys getting ads? I told them not to put them on stream. Wah! Oh, well, I can definitely go to that lake right now. What? She's trying to gain it. Right, so we basically just don't, just don't get caught by the AI. I don't know how severe it is or if it's like accessible. Wah, it doesn't seem too bad. Um... Who even gets bothered by the bees? Well, literally, if you're considering, like, with a hook or something like that. Here? That doesn't seem right. Woah! No way I did that! Wait, is there a hidden- Yeah, okay, let's definitely do the hidden stuff first. I'm shooting my laser beam! Oh my god, this is so OP! Sorry, but actually... What is here? Oh, I went the right way. I went the right way. Uh... She's charging my laser. The laser's also two times your sword damage. Are you winning, Strunnion Chat? Yeah, we're infusing the third element! We now are adding the water element to the sword. Which is fantastic. I don't have my blanket and I'm killing the circulation in my leg. It's my pure accident. I don't have access to my alternative Twitter. But I hope that audio did well. The power of the element allows you to split into three copies now. That's cute. We're winning when Strunnion is on the screen. There we go, just like that! The audio was Ace here. What is it? I was like, oh, it's so cringe. Like, I struggle so much to talk when I'm like that. I was just like... Please read me out. I was the best I got. I couldn't do it anymore. Okay, glad you're in. Ah, frickin', not to be... Yikes, my nerve. Sorry, I just woke up. No, I didn't. I didn't. No, you gave me money. I didn't get demonetized. That's what it's saying for people who like hate when I go like burger bing-boot, but it's babas bing-boot. The reason why I brought it up is because we didn't get... Gammy, stop it. Not again. We didn't get demonetized. But thank you for the tip. Thank you for the super chat. Was there something under here? There it was. Burger bing-boot, that is. The bath we knew won. We knew won. We're doing it. I don't know what we're doing, but we're doing it. We're not jumping down. We probably should go gambuzzle shells soon. What do you think, Link? Pretty dark and spooky, isn't it? Makes you want to cry, doesn't it? You're not scared? Well, neither am I. Come on, let's go. I'm actually going to chug my tea. I do apologize. Tell you what, we'll go to Hyrule because it sounds a bit more nice. The background ambiance in Hyrule is a bit nicer. Let me just slurp this tea. But thank you, Broly Legends99 underscore. You're getting very specific with the names here. We're on an adventure. Big Ben Zershin. I have no clue what this is. Like Big Bilbo Baggins. Like Big Bilbo Baggins, Big Plugs. Like Toys, that kind of thing. Algo has no close stroneas. I'm architect. Oh, no, you can say architect because it just sounds like architecture. Don't forget to take them in if you haven't. Oh, I'm already hired, okay. I changed my wind. She's gone, lads. The Vietnamese fucked me up real good but they also have really good food so I'll allow this discretion that has been against me via the Vietnamese. But I forgive you, Vietnamese lady that destroyed my toe. Yeah, I changed it. Healing very beautifully. I'm very happy to say it doesn't look like there's any sign of infection. Doesn't smell like that. Not getting any indication. So I get to put a salt bath for it very... I think in five, well, four days to soak away what I can. They said you can use hot water and swirl it around but it's a bit too sensitive for that at the moment. I'd rather not. But I'll do a salt bath shortly but we're healing nicely. Things are looking good. The painkillers are painkilling. And life is good. I've got a few shorts of the girls coming on the way which I'm excited about. I'm going to put some cheeky advertisement money into as I always do. Mercy's short. I thoroughly enjoyed Shout out to the editor. They just applied themselves on the website and they turned out to be exactly what I was looking for. Edit and style and all. And they've never complained about any of the edits either. I love me. I love me an edit and slave that doesn't complain about work. I love it when you guys still complain and I get to put you at work. But he edited Mercy's Senpai Should I Be Blonde and I've got everyone to do a version of that. I'm about to send that off. Oh no. Strony's removed Tony on chat. No. I'm still here watching mommy. Are you watching me in spirit? Because you no longer exist. We're all willing slaves on this farm. Yes but not for cat-a-wise. Not cat-a-wise. Ever been jealous of an editor? Yeah, me too. I mean... Is it jealousy? Is it jealousy if I'm taking advantage of the editor's hard work? Is it jealousy if I'm taking advantage? Strony was here peeling you in on the new Zelda game. I haven't... I'm still yet to see it actually. I do apologize. However, it looks fantastic. I would watch it live with you guys. But if you didn't know, most game trailers actually get copyrighted. Because for promotional reasons they get permissions of certain songs or additives Yes? It should have been me. If you phrase it like that, yes. Oh, right. Well, fucking relax. You know. I just put the files together. So, can I tell you some secrets? But these are bad secrets, okay? These are bad secrets. No one should know. Oh, Tim... Tim Schrotto. Tim Schrotto. There, see? Netherlands praten. I'm from the Netherlands? Thank you very much. One euro. Thank you very much. Yeah. Streaming must not be named was very useful. I am glad you guys didn't judge me. I honestly thought I was like, relatively like... But, like, you know, I went exploring and I was like, damn, strong a freak. And I'm like, am I actually? Are you guys just scared to explore? Please leave me alone. Gami! Gami, when did you get your hair done? I've seen more degenerates. Yeah, we're up there with you. Okay, thank God. Gami, I see you in that tree. Don't think I don't see you, Gami. Gami, don't be naughty. Gami, that... Okay, that's just a quick way down. Tharya, thank you for coming, a member. Hi, BW. I was... I was like, oh, you need to stay filled in. Right, what's the plan? What's the plan, Batman? Up. What's the plan? What's the plan? You need to tell me the strategies. Left. Hmm, I know what left is. Yes, yes, left. Do you remember as a child, I couldn't do this section? Same as before. Left. Oh, no. I wonder I couldn't do this as a child. Same as the beginning. Up. Up, left, left, up, right. Up, left, left, up, right. Same as two before. Up, left, left, left, up, right. Up. Oh, thank god. Don't ever make me do a logic puzzle again. The disrespect. The disrespect. Make me do a logic puzzle first thing in the morning. There was a key that's needed tomorrow. Okay, a key. Oh, it's a new house. Oh, hello. My name's Dampi. I'm a grave digger. What's that? You were called here by the ghost of the king. That'd be the ancient king of Hyrule who rests here. I've seen him myself. Well, it's just king. I can't see any reason not to let you in here. Take this key. Oh, that was a super easy little safe quest. Mummy do be smart. Well done. Easy peasy lemon squeezy. Gami! Gami. What's with that crow? He up and flew away with a key. Charge after him and get that dang key. I lost the key. Have you got a spare? What? A crow took the key and flew away with the tree. Well, don't just stand around and get the crow. Charge at him and give him that tree a rattle if you want it back. If you stay with a person long of you, spice things up. Oh, yeah? Mellow to spice things up by going in the book. Oh, it was that quick. So we managed to get the key back. Yeah. Okay. Please tell me it's not going to swoop down and yank it and it was just like a little small side thing. I'll open the gate for you. Be careful this time though. Hello. I'm going to kill you. Hello. Yeah, let's fuse. I love crows but that behavior is unexpected. Oh, we never played that. What does it do? What have we just done? Hey, I've just had a great idea. This will add you a little more risk. I'm so excited. Curious. They fit perfectly. Hi. What are you doing here? This is a graveyard. There's ghosts here. Oh, yeah. Speaking of which, my brother lives in town. He's a troublemaker prankster, but I often wonder what he's doing. Push. No. No. Wait. Why did that give me a noise though? Did he dig the grave? Surely not. Okay. Yeah, we're not doing that. How about this? No. Oh, okay. We need to push through graves at a time. Oh, we need to hit those buttons. Wait, are these like all secret graves? No great braving for our shock and behavior. Look, I'm a child. I don't know the implicate. Why would I move that one? And why did it give me the do-do-do-do-do-do-do? Oh. Can I do it? I can. Can I? Is that three or four? I took my legs off. Oh, let's go. You got a piece of heart. Dang straight, I got a piece of heart. I'm just so good, baby. So this one didn't move. I wonder if the king's grave is up there. Surely a mystery. We'll never know. Okay, let's try this again. No, no. It's just grave discovery. How do I get over there without breaking my guys? Oh. I can just like pass through stuff. Oh. Oh. It may be the royal crepe, but graves are creepy. No matter where they are, where is the king's supposed to meet? I'm good stuff. I'm not so sure. I even want to help anymore. Can we just go somewhere that's less creepy? Oh my God, he took a hammer in. He took a hammer in. I'm doing aimbot from halfway through. I'm literally sniping him from the map. So that's horrifying. Oh no. What one is it? Is it this one? Because I can see a platform there. Right replaying. Middle left or right? We just wanted to hold. You can burn the mummies with a lamp. Right, get that lamp right here. Middle was first. Oh, it doesn't make a difference. What's going on here? What's going on? Ah. Oh wow, that disappeared so quick. Okay, okay, okay. I was getting a bit worried. I was getting a bit nervous that nothing was going to occur there. Oh no. This is not good. Do I have time? Wah, wah, wah, wah. Okay, that was freaking lucky. Because that was not good. That was not good. But we did it. We did it. We did whatever challenge was necessary. Further into the... You... The devs knew exactly what they were doing putting that there. That is so cheeky, honestly. Well, this totally doesn't look like a battle dome. Yeah, yeah, yeah. How do I put them on fire? How do I put them on fire? Oh. I need to give it a drive by. You didn't tell me there were scallies underneath. Of course the fires start attacking me too. Oh wow, we like sped on that. We didn't even have to go left or right. Yeah, can you speed it up a bit, mate? Yeah, a bit quicker. I've not got all day, mate. Yeah, a bit faster. You got a canstone piece. These mystic stones are said to bring happiness. Fascinating. An ancient king of Hyrule. How strange. And the source of the flow. What's that supposed to mean? Her fanny, mate, obviously. Wait, no, you kicked me out. I didn't finish exploring. Let me back in. Wait, did I even have a key? Oh, they're fake doors. No way. Oh wait, how did I get back? Oh, suck, suck, suck, suck. Mumbo. I was like, you said it enough. A little cheeky suckage there. I got nervous there, right. We'll go thank the graveyard guy for letting me in. Thank you. Oh, he's already gone home. Honestly, I'd be home too. Hi. Oh, less, less, less, up, up, up, down. What was that last time? Yeah, let's fuse. What you got for me. Stranny, I know you approve of dolls. What if the doll is taller than the person normally is? Has it all been done? Oh. Well, I guess we're going back to the graveyard. A tall, skeletal doll? Cheeky skeletal moment? I don't know. Oh, hello. Hello. Ah, so you moved the graveyard and now you can go outside. I'll get lonely. Can you come see me sometime? I have plenty of Kinstones. Oh, is this like infinite Kinstone person? Like a Slenderman doll. I don't think I could tolerate a Slenderman doll. Oh. Well, that's the source of the floor if I've ever seen one. A waterfall. Hello. How many shells? I think we might need to gamble. Oh, we're 700. Do you have any more to fuse together like you claimed young lady? Oh, you do. I wonder if she's just an infinite... I'll come back. I'll come back. I need to cut the grass, okay? The source of the floor is... Wow. I fucking got so nervous. I was ready to pop at two minutes. I got a little heated during the stream. I was ready to pop after two minutes. I was like, bro, I can't. And then I got shy, so I actually lasted the normal amount of time and I was like, yeah, this one's like... What's in here? Hello. Well, we definitely need to gamble now after that. Yeah, I expected minutes just to be talking. No. Are we really doing gamble? I don't know. Gamble time. Hello. Traits. The odds of us getting the same thing is diabolical. If we end up with the same one figure percentage, this just proves my gamble luck is just outrageously bad. Aw, Zill and friends. Zill is the one with the drippy nose. He likes to wander around town with his pals. He knows a lot about Hyrule and he might even give you some tips. Aw. I don't... Right, we'll do this for like a whole four minutes, okay? That's the best I got. Four minutes in me and then we'll move on to the actual gameplay. I think we have to go top right now and then we unlock the last area and the last item. Um... Our probability is 97%. How many... Is there a hundred figurines on the door? You... Catch a game play. Golden rule. They call the snakes the rules. I mean, I guess. Okay. Stunning hearing you finish... Oh. Great. Now she's cool to live. Aw, wait a minute. I'm glad you... Bond Liz. Thank you for the mimbo. There's a girl from my hero. Your profile picture is bigger. Let's take the girl from my hero. I just forgot the name. 95%. Right. I'll stop. Yeah, tell you what, I'll make a deal. I'll stop once we get a duplicate. A chaser. Yeah, those things were chasing me. They were getting my ankles, honestly. We'll stop when we get a duplicate so we can be hero. Hemiko. Yeah. There are 136 figurines total. Okay. So the probability is two. Well, I guess that's our gamble time over. Thank you everyone for playing at home. I appreciate it. I appreciate it. Literally what the percentage is so high. And it was one that we had literally just go up. Oh wait, I can swim now. Right, can I still not get this? It doesn't look like... I don't see a Minish entrance. Oh, I need to jump with a freaking cape. Right, okay, we're gonna go get a cape. Right, no one wants to trade me. That's fine. We'll go get some switch for the reeflings because I don't want you guys to be too hungry. On our adventure, I'll get you your lovely cape. Yes, thank you. Nothing this time. That's okay. As long as the reefling got some food in this, come on. I wonder what the mayor says now that we've been in his house. I may look somewhat idle too, but no, sir. I'll be working terrifically hard as soon as you leave. You can bet that. Oh, he's just like classic doesn't do anything. Right, we now need to go top. Right, let's speed things up a bit. Get to work. Oh, sorry. Sorry, my bad. Wait, is that a bump tree? Oh, a cheeky bear. Hey, I could actually use you right now because I can't shoot my laser beam. Thank you. Basically every polish. Hey, you can't say that. Oh, we can swim. Once we get the last item, we will do a full exploration. Whoa, I can see that guy with a rock helmet over there. Oh, I'm getting... No, no bomba, no bomba. Hello. Oh, that's what the king gave us. The two fit perfectly. He has a cool hat as well. What's your favorite item in this game? A stone door. So that's what they meant by the source of the flow business. Well, this waterfall certainly is the source of Hyrule's water. According to King Gustav, the final element lies somewhere behind these falls. We've done a long enough length. Let's paint that element. Maybe my favorite item is the light so I can fucking see in this cave. Oh, I'm missing. I'm missing. The bat's just so skinny. Right, whoops. In both. Um... Oh god, what's that doing? Oh, you can't destroy it. I'm on fire and I can't do anything. I guess it makes you vulnerable. Oh, no more bomba. No more bombs. I can't take any more bombs. Give me my gambaba. Oh my god, why is he so aggressive? Get me up this wall. Oh no, they're going to chase me up the wall. No, leave me alone. Leave me alone. I'm just a per innocent boy. I have no family. Spare my life. Hey, we found another wind crest. Absolutely, right. Let me think about that. Stop! Oh my god, just a minute. Get me in this cave right now. It's even worse than the cave. Oh, that didn't even hurt him. What's there here? Okay, just... I swear if it shells. Bro, we've got enough shells. I don't want a gambaba though. I don't want to send gambaba. Oh, gambaba at the end. Up or down, up or down. I'm going up. I'm going up. I'm going up stairs. I'm going to enter. Jeez, the bat and fire station caverns. Think of the tourism industry. Okay, I'll take you. What? What? I need out. I need out. Jeez, let me. The race. Wait. I've just done a 360. No. Right. Yeah, I was going to say, there's clearly something in the war if it's giving me a ledge. Some of those are ropes though. I'm not even interacting with that. Anything in here? Whoa, red. Oh, yes, I've unlocked it. Have a gun. It was like, what? Oh, I'm rubbish at this game. Shawnee's going to turn into a hoarder of pyramid crafts all of a sudden. Literally, there's so many shells. So this wasn't the way I was supposed to go. What is? I think I've done wrong then. What? Oh, there's a door there. That I didn't take. There is a fitting fitting. Okay, there we go. There we go. Did it? Sorry, excuse me. Pardon me, coming through. What have we here? Some kind of vortex? Well, we seem to have hit a dead end. What shall we do from here? Go in the vortex. Close talk. Close talk. Am I still alive? Link, what were you thinking, child? You just reaped the world winds, as they say. We could be dead right now. I must admit, it did the trick. Are we? Are we? In the lands above the clouds? Then there must be something here that can lead us to the fire element. Let's go find it. Ah, you surprised me. Normally, surface dwellers can't walk on the clouds like we do. My sister and I went to the Depokori Festival on Hyrule Town, and when we came back, there were monsters everywhere. I bet if I could just fuse a Kinstone, but there are monsters about even... Do you think you could search for the Kinstone people? Oh, do you need like... Oh, no, we can do it. Fly, Strony, fly! My favorite dungeon. Are you late this year? I think the air tops are maybe... Really? I know the reward is like... getting... Uh, yeah, we li- Did I not skip the clouds? Oh, hello. Okay, but I don't have what you need. What about you? Oh, this is bad, really bad. Oh, hey, look at that. I've never seen a surface dweller on the clouds. You must be pure of heart. Maybe one such as you would listen to the tale of my woe. See? Right, I'm... I just heard it from your sister. Thank you. That sounded really rude. Oh, no, no, no, no. I do have it. Sorry, I pressed the wrong button. The controls are... Slightly different position. Ooh, where did we unlock? Cause it's red. Ooh, is it gonna be a coup? Oh, we were just there! I was just there! Rude. Honestly. Okay. Uh, let's go a little further right? Cause I can... Or no. What am I the bad dude? Heh heh heh. What's down here? Wow! We are short. I like how we get to dig the clouds. That's so cool. Oh! Wait! We can get Kenstone pieces in here? Or was that, like, actually there? I think that may have actually been sitting there. Okay. Uh, let's fold down. Cause we've not been in them here. Wow! Hello! Did I have your missing piece? I did! All yours, buddy. Mysterious cloud. Uh... A couple more to go, I guess? That's probably more shells, honestly. Uh, we take a little left here. A little cheeky left. Uh, what is over here? Is there anything of interest? No. Let's jump down first to make sure we have, adequately, the woman trouble. Oh god, they're going to knock me off the map. Okay. Two hit. Oh, he just... Oh, we got a... Okay, okay, okay. Second piece, second piece. Yeah, let me get up, let me get up. Thank you. Skyfish. Skyshark. Honestly. Skiyark. Great. What is this down here? A little to the left. A little to the left. Let's grab that wind gust. Don't want to get in trouble. Let me get up. Let me get up. Uh, oh, there was something up there. Hmm. Can I do it? Whoa, where are you? Did I need a shield from him? Well, luckily... Okay. I'm sorry. What was that supposed to do? A bow and arrow? I think a bow and arrow. Oh, suck him up. Because he's an arrow thing. Gimme your cloud right now. Yeah, yeah, yeah. You're not so big without your cloud now, are you? Mario's gonna... Oh, sugar. Right, we need to come back to this one. Because we don't have the correct piece. Surely, I will not forget the location. Surely. Hope you'll... Okay, uh, middle left is... Uh, tree... Middle left. What? What? What? No, chicken shells, but I'm so full. Jar of boomerang will not... What? That is my favorite mermaid waifu? I ain't even a mermaid. Oh, good thing. Ah. Oh, there's another one of those guys. Wait, you perish. Yeah, we're getting there with the minish. We're on the last element, and then I think everything goes to do the time. Yeah, yeah. Perish. Oh. Okay. Is this it? Okay, we now know... it's middle left for whatever one is missing. Oh, there's five? Oh, them... I don't know what one to do then. Oh, well, I don't mind if I do. Oh. Am I gonna have to do a second lap? I feel like I'm gonna have to do a second lap around this area. I don't know. I can't remember your style. As soon as you said mermaid, and I'm like, I'm not a mermaid. And I'm like, oh, wait a minute. I was like, oh, wait, hold on a minute. Hold on a minute. I didn't write that part of my line. Oh, I got two licks in. I'm the most. One each. You know, for an enemy, you sure as heck don't actually directly attack. I'm gonna get shoved off the map because of that. Oh, I need to defeat him. No, I'm... Okay, I need like an eight-foot sword, like an Elden Ring. Or just do that and knock yourself out. Aren't sirens the evil mermaids? I mean, I guess. I guess you're lucky that I don't have to sing, or you'd be in such deep doo-doo. You're not in deep doo-doo. Right, enough with the shells. We ain't go all the time at Gambo. Sure, drop this here. I won't say there's something here. Just get me up. Freaking go. There's a cheeky hole. What's up there? I don't know. What's down here? Oh, a fusion. I'll take it. I'll take it. You fit. Perfect. I calculated. Calculate. Yes, yes, calculate. True, true, emoji gamer. Okay, two more. I have one golden piece. I just need the other one. I can go back to the middle one that I missed. Wow, we can't get up there. But we can get radio. There's not like a secret on the wall or anything. Where are we going? Where are we going? Come on. Okay, we're now back on the other one. I need to go top left to get the last piece. Which I'm going to do right now. Top left. Yes. Baby, last piece. Oh my God. I'm so smart. Oh, there's something here. Hey, don't give me. You know what? Okay. Okay. I should have gambled. I admit it. I should have kept gambling. I apologize. I should have kept gambling. Okay. I think it was in here. Literally the game's like, please gamble. I'm like, I'm child. I shouldn't be doing it. Right. Did we? I think it's back at the start. And the other one. There's a back at the start. Question mark. I don't know. Serves you right for not gambling. Did you know that 100% of people that win big give up, like right before, I can't remember what the meme format is, but yeah, it's awful. Please don't actually gamble. I'm actually getting a bit turned around now. I'm like 99%. I already did this one today. So what's up here? Okay. I grabbed that one. What was back down here? I can't remember. 90% of gambling addicts quit before they hit big. Yeah, literally that's so terrible. That meme format is absolutely a reader. I'd actually be really interested in doing a deep dive into the gamble psychology because I struggle to comprehend it because I just get really... Right. Am I going the wrong way again? I think I might have. Oh, I got red. Okay, it is just random. I'm running in circles. I know I'm trying to get back to the start. I don't know where the last podium is. Any podium goers? I think it's back at the start. I think I just can go back now because I've got the piece. Unless it was back there. Wait, hold on. Let me do a U-turn. I'm too busy yapping. No, we did do it. Right, go back up again. Yeah, the last one's back at the start. Okay, okay, okay. No, no, Link, no. I'm starting to think you just like the gravity of falling. You can't go back to the start from here. Always gambit till you're broke. No, this is terrible. I think it's to the right there. Right, I just need to take our U-turn right and then we found it. This, this is it. Surely. Sure is it. Oh, there it is. I just need a drop down. Wow. Whoever said go right, time them out. No one said that. You don't have to say that anymore. Oh, we did it, we did it, we did it. Get me the heck out here. Why gamble when you can give your money a mummy? No, well, you don't need to do that either. What's more of a ways gamble or giving me money? Choose your, choose your challenger. We did it, yeah. Fantastico, fantastico, let's go. And we got two redkenstone pieces of all that. Oh my god, look how pretty it is. Oh, and we can get a freaking flight stolen. Thank goodness. Hey, we found another wincrease. Now we have one more to travel to when we use the ocarina. Hey, ocarina. Now, how do you build something like this on top of a clown? Maybe someone lives inside. If so, perhaps you could ask for the element. I'm just checking if there's a hidden secret on the outside, but no. It's kinda... Okay, now the man's out of my way. Do you remember that portal? Do you remember that portal? Oh, if it's an old link, my quest to match kinstones has taken me all the way up here. I'm not sure you've noticed yet, but we're on top of the clouds. The wind trebles here. They protect the path of the palace of winds where the wind element lies. Oh, it's you. I thought I'd never make it back here, but thanks to your kinstone, I did. If you're looking for something, go talk to the elderly lady on the fourth floor. Okay, elderly lady, fourth floor. Blue flower, white thorns. There's something like that, I can't remember. Oh yeah, give me your pot. Look, there's the old man. He's up in there, and there's something. Oh, it's Link. Thank you for your help over there. I've got something else here. Take this. Huh? Did you double damage? Did you double damage? Imagine if I let that gentleman slip away. Why is everyone asking for the pieces I don't have? You know, feel well. I don't have that piece. He just upgraded my bowl. Hello? Let me guess. You're going to ask for a piece I don't have? Oh, you asked for the piece I actually do know. Hold the button. A snake. Yeah, yeah. It's all coming in my way. Well done. Hey, they set perfectly. The wind tribe is very skilled at pieces. So skilled in fact. We have more of them than we can manage. We can't even store them. I wish someone would take them. You wish someone would take them? Say no more. No, I'm not doing anything in here at all. Yeah, oh, thanks. She's slow. I'll take that. Don't mind if I do. Thanks, hen. I appreciate it. Yeah, your collection's a whale. Oh, what's that? You need someone to take away all your pieces? Oh, you shouldn't. Yeah, you shouldn't. What's going on? Welcome, welcome. Long, long ago and then the age before that. I tried the brand and the place you call the wind ruins. With our magic, we moved our palace up into the skies. We are the wind tribe. We've been watching and we know all that is happening on your surface world. We know a small boy collects elements to lift the curse for a princess. We know of Vati and his evil acts. The winds tell us these things. The wind element that you seek lies deep in the palace of winds above me. When the blade has been infused with four elements, sorry, forgetting my lines here, the way to the light force shall open. So it is told in the legend of the wind tribe. Vati himself may already know this. Surfaced well as they're not permitted to enter our palace, but you, boy, are special. You may continue to the roof. Can I fuse with you? You're a cheeky granny, you are. You're cheeky cheeky granny. You got me a weekend stone to fuse. There's this device in the palace that allows you to fly in the sky. When I get bigger, I want to explore the palace and find it, but I'm too scared right now. You just walked over me. That's rude. And before someone complains about being weighed down by Cherries. Cherries for me to take. Right here. Oh, baby! Okay, full health. Ready? Ready? We're going to do this and I'll make a tea, and then we'll do lots of exploring to see if we can get all the hearts and stuff. One, irritation. We find our way to the very tops of the cloud, and then we have to go even higher to find a floating palace. I can't believe what a long way we've come. And look how high we are. Don't look down, blink, and watch your step. It's a long fall from here, ya bam. Look, I'm trying my best, jeez. Don't need to... Oh, I'm gonna need them. I'm gonna need to... There's so many enemies on this map. Oh. Oh, it made them fall. Oh, that's not very nice. Where'd they go? Can I stop coming? No! I didn't know you could do that! But the scallies... I just got pranked. And 4k. Alright, hold on. We need to do the boomerang. So we need to do the boomerang? Is that it? Am I going crazy? What do I need? A bow and arrow? Am I like, banned arrows now? Okay, okay. Arrows, arrows. It's fine, it's fine. Guys, why are you sweating? I was going, hmm, I missed the logic in this puzzle. Oh, whoa. I almost fell off the map because I wasn't paying attention. Eeps. Eeps. Okay, let's do a bow and arrow. I need to go by with 3? Okay, okay, okay, okay. Why would you give me stones? I can push, I have no idea. Wow. Music game, good. Wow, please don't hurt me. Please don't hurt me. Whoa. Okay, I've actually got a fright there. I'm like, I just jumped in my chair. Like, I knew it was going to happen, but I still got a fright nonetheless. What is going on? Whoa. What am I to go? I can't do that. Whoa, whoa. Where's the fire going? Oh my God, I'm so skinny. I'm actually so skinny, I didn't get hit once, Lamal. There's a fluffy cloudflown here. It looks awfully comfortable. I too would like to sleep on a cloud. Should I? I'm going to use the boomerang. Oh. Because it doesn't cost any ammo. I jumped too. Literally, give me a wee fray. Oh, I'm supposed to be here. Ew, what happens if I sat on it? Oh, I'm actually... Logic puzzle or I'm just... Am I going the wrong way? Okay. Use a bomb. I'm about to blow this. I would not have figured that out. I'm going to be honest. Oh, yum. Ah. Shadow Wizard money game. We look at these spills. Well, I lost that fight anyway. Oh. I wondered that. We unlocked the figurines before we actually went against them. Bro, bro, bro, bro, bro, bro. This is the shit. This is the shit. Shadow Wizard money game. Oh, I'll get wrecked. Oh, I'll get wrecked. Oh, bless I am. You've got Rockscape. Great. Jump with the greatness of Ease. Hold the button and jump faster. Right. Oh my god. Oh, I'm so good. I'm actually so good. This game. Well, we can officially fully explore the map now. We'll do. Gamma. I saw that. I'm actually so good. You have this figure. You must be a fan of the family. Oh my god. I love being able to jump. Okay. I just can't roll up them. I cast and bear her growth. I'm still in mulch. I'm still addicted to mulch. Whoa. Game shields up. I can't. There's a strong gale blowing here. Try not to get swept away and hold on to your hat. You're my hat. Am I supposed to get blown away? I think I'm supposed to jump. I am supposed to jump. Whoa. I was almost gone there. I'm not going to lie. We almost didn't make that jump there. Oh. What? Okay. We need to do the magic staff thing. Okay. Okay. We're getting there. We're getting there. Zelda. Let's go. That panel. I think if we stomped on it hard enough, it might flip over. Yeah. We're still missing two bottles. No. I ain't doing it. The money's good, but I ain't doing it. I ain't missing it. I don't actually remember how difficult the boss is up ahead. There is a possibility we have to go... We have to go back. We have to go deeper. Because we are missing out on a lot of exploratory goodies. Oh my... Bruh, who's... How skinny you can come? Ah, can I do it in time? No, by a freaking bore here. No, Gami. Stop it. Gami, that's mean. Okay. It looks like I need to jump between two. Yes. After this area, we'll do exploring. We'll try and get full hearts. We'll go back to all those master tutor people as well. Professional speedrunner confirmed, actually, though. Witch dungeon. This is for the fourth element, the wind element. We're in the sky temple. I might want to activate my boots first. Oh, I don't like this. I don't like this. I'm just going to take the HP damage because... Yeah, I don't want to have to do this. Oh, and the fucking boots respawned. Well, I'm not mad with Spain. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Oh, and the respawn. One thing I could absolutely decimate about this game. Okay, and then straight down. Jeez, get me over there. I tried to put up my uno collab. Schedule, and it kept rejecting it for some reason. I think me, Mercy, and me are just too powerful. I kept saying error when I put it up. Sorry about the uno collab not being up, but there is an uno collab. Oh, as far as I'm aware, there's an uno collab. Silly me. Silly me. I'm being a silly sausage. But I'll try and get it up. Why did you do that? I'll try and get it up after the stream. Oh, killing me. Tiny time. Tiny time. Tiny time. Oh, no. Oh, no, this can't be. Is this a logic puzzle? Well, I can only push it. Oh, shit. Like this. Oh, that's a star. A bluntly half as well. I'm making it worse. I'm making it worse. I'm making it worse. I'm making it worse. Oh, no way I did it. Oh, no way I did it. Oh, my God. I don't know how I did that. I'll take it. I think this dungeon is actually pretty big. Can't believe you let me cook. Can I jump over this? Can I jump over this? No. Oh. I never see it until it's really obvious. I got it lucky. Wait, no. Did not already have access to this area? Did not already have access to this area? I'm losing it. But I just did that. Oh, I have a key to get here. Yeah. When Twilight Princess, I've never played another Zelda game. This is the issue. The only reason I'm doing malely good on this one is because I actually played it before. But focusing, there's another... a new 2D Zelda out which I'm actually super interested in. I need to watch the trailer. But I think we might be playing Baltoi. Baltoi? Baltoi. Baltoi next week. That's lovely, the piece that I've been needing. I need to do what now? Okay, I just send it. What? Thank you, Imperial Monarch. You're work right now? Oh, I'm doing lawn work. Oh my god. Someone commented under the video, like the audio. You should... oh, I'm at work right now. So I can't listen. And I always so tend to send back. No, do it. Get hard at work. I can't be doing this. People are getting fucking trouble for this shit, honestly. But I was feeling it yesterday. You guys were letting me talk about whatever my interests are in that. So my brain was like, yeah, let's get rid of this. How did I hurt myself in trying to hurt the enemy? Please get us in trouble. No, like, literally, I was like, no, this is... I had to hold myself back. I don't know if you guys do this, but I type out responses on Twitter and stuff, and then I delete it because I'm like, no, you idiot. That's not a good idea. Don't do that. That's so bad of me. Hey, it is from... Can I even get him? Yeah, I was going to say, can I even get him without perishing? One way or another, he's going to get me. It wouldn't mind some hearts. I'm starting to get a bit low. Finally finished working, mummy. Thank you for the... yeah! You're welcome! Less than 3,000. Thank you so much. Broly legend, thank you. Sorry. I'm struggling. Just, just, just... I'm struggling to read. I can't believe it. I can't believe my inability to read is coming back to me. Oh, there's a heart! There's a heart! There's a heart! Wait, this is not where I'm supposed to go? Where am I supposed to go? Oh, I can just go for it. Because I have flight now. Can I jump for this one? No, you cannot! Please, if you ever thought that you could perhaps jump for that one, please don't jump for that one. Don't be like me and think you can make it. You cannot make that jump. Eh... That's what office toilets are for. That's terrible! Right into... right in his arms. All of my guests, you're one too. Please, game you... this game... What the fuck is that? Armor? Okay. I need to buy a large quiver right now. Because if... ow! Bro, this game needs to start dropping hearts. Please do not make me go all the way back to the start. I'll cry. Bruh. I need focus. I actually need to focus! What's going on? I need to focus. Yeah, yeah, get fucked. What is going on? How much freaking arrow I put in you? Oh, I'm actually gonna die. What happens if you die in Legend of Zelda? Oh my god, the teleport's right there, I think. This is the first teleport. Okay. Okay, okay, okay, okay. Let me get up, let me get up. Oh! What the... Wait, so I put a billion arrows? No, this isn't the teleport out! Sugar, I thought this was the teleport here. I am so low, but I don't want to go all the way back. Holy crap, I just need to not mess it up. Don't mess... Don't mess it up, it's fine. Don't mess it up though. Don't mess it up! Can someone drop me a heart? Like, seriously? No, I couldn't have done that worse if I tried! If I tried, if I tried. If I tried. Literally, the game has put me on life support. Oh, am I actually gonna die? I really don't want to go back though! Oh, please have a heart in this. Can I keep leaving the room and then coming back? Oh wait, I need a pot, sorry. Hold on, is this gonna drop a heart if I do this? It's dropping rupees, so if it's respawn and there's a chance it'll give me a heart. Hold on, hold on! Bear with me, bear with me, Aces in the room, bear with me. Oh, come on! Give us a chance for a heart! Why is this game so allergic to dropping hearts from pots? Literally, I'm just getting my bank account up right now. A freaking shell! I don't need a shell! I actually am starting to wonder if they even coded any hearts to drop in these pots. Yeah, thanks for the five rupees. That is useless for me right now. Do you have fairies? Oh, I do have fairies! Alright, I'll use one fairy. That will have to do. There is a possibility. We don't do this, you know that? We might have to go back and get more. Thank you for your... Yeah, you're more than welcome. Ah! Of course a heart drops when I've dunked the fairy. Ah! Oh, Justin no more. Yeah? Okay, well... Shadow Wizard? I'm gonna get it. Ah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah! Don't do that again. Jesus, I was cheating. Oh, they're giving these kinsome pieces though, because I kinda need to trade. They're gonna lie. Don't fight me, bro. Give me a heart! Give me a heart! Don't be shy! Give me a heart! Can I whack him when I'm around? I'm just going for it. I'm just going for it. We are getting so low health. We are getting so low health! Oh my god. That for a key? Something has to give. Something has to give. Wait, can I just permanently get rid of this guy? Fuck you! Did they always drop fairies? New Zelda lore? Did they always drop fairies when you whack them? Or was that just like really good rear drop? Get in my bowl! Get in the jar! What? No! No way! Oh my god, we got the big key, but we still don't have the teleport. We didn't drop fairies! Fuckin' get hit ya! Bam! Give me that right now. Right, we've got two fairies. Oh my god, learning! Ronnie talking to Reflings. I just called you guys Ronnie there. Ronnie and Reflings together becomes Ronnie! Yeah, yeah, yeah, and all the hearts are here. Oh god. Oh, I'm sure I've mentioned this before, but I'm no good with heights. Hold on, I think I see something down there. I guess that means we have to take the plunge after all. Oh shi... Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. I've got my wee tiny shield. You be nice to... I looked the wrong way! No! I'm at full health! Oh my god, sorry. I'm having a stroke. Link keeps looking so. I don't know why. I don't know why. How big is his freakin' sweat? Ah! Oh, I need my shield. Why is it he can push me off the map? But when I go to push him off the map, that's no possible. And then he says I'm a wane. I've literally... Is that gonna work? What am I doing? I'm having a stroke but not the good kind! Oh! I'm having a stroke but not the good kind! Oh my god! Right, I'm just gonna keep coming back and forth. I was getting absolutely rolled. That is embarrassing how bad that went. I need to keep coming back to respawn the hearts. I'm so sorry. Mapologies, mapologies. Yeah, we're definitely exploring to get the rest of the hearts. Because if I'm making and the rest of the jars, if I'm making mistakes like that, we ain't gonna be making it through anything. This is supposed to be a game for children question mark? Absolutely not. Because that is insane. Right, let's go. Is there like 10 Pokemon sound effects in one? What do you mean? How much further do we have to go? This place goes on forever. There's no point in complaining about it. We must press on more. After all, how much more could there be? Come on Link, let's go. I like how the game acknowledges this area is so vast and ridiculous. Okay, hearts. Oh, no. I do not consent. Okay, hug someone else. Okay, up the stairs. What's up here? Slames. Okay, let's suck these guys off. Aw, I could have got a double kill there. Um... Mom. Oh, that's what I didn't want. I assume I need to do that. Well, maybe if you weren't so selfish and now I'm gonna have to restart the room and do that all over again. I should have been new. Oh, I kept them all perished. Okay, that's fine. That's fine. Don't be nervous. Don't be shy. Is anyone online right now that I need to shout out from the Allure? Any of the Allures online? Or what's the situation? Oh, I can jump over these. I was like, aw, I can't do anything about that. Wee! Oh, just no more. I got a kill. Sheeby and Azura in 30. Oh my god, that's right. They're playing um, they're playing Jelly Bean game. Uh, if anyone wants to join them, you can. Oh, sorry, I'm to jump into it. My apologies. Yes, I'm to jump into it. Yes, I knew that. Okay, well, I completely missed a lot. Wee! Uh, yes, they are going to load up a lobby first and give each other, get each other in the lobby and then they're going to reveal the code so you can Jelly Bean snipe, uh, Sheeby and Azura. Yeah, okay. Jelly Bean game! Uh, this is my problem. I don't know if they just continually respawn. It's very plausible that they do. Can I not? Okay, I was going to say, can I not do that? Uh, no. You're in my way. Please don't do that again. Uh, I've just done a 360. Ow, where? Um, I think I need to jump down in the middle here. You know that? You know that? I'm getting a memory. I'm getting a memory! Oh, I love Childhood Me. You're so smart. Thank you for coming. We're literally saving this run right now. Childhood Me, I'm not even joking. We got a... Yeah, I'll take that heart, please. Great. So we go up here again. Core memory found. Literally accessing core memory. Right, and then... Oh, you lose health so quick in this game. Hold on a minute. Let him get up. Let him get up. Let me try again. Let me try again. That's it. Let him get up. Let him get up. If it's gonna be safer going all the way around, I will go all the way around because, bruh, let him get up. Let me redo. Give me a shot. As if this is safer. I think I actually is, though. Lulululu... Lulululu... Lulululu... Okay. Why am I so premature with my fricking actions? Man... I could have sworn. Okay, let's try that again. Let him get...let me get up. Let me go. There! As everyone is my witness, I am on it. Right, so what's up here? Okay, it is definitely a lot faster just to go the other way. I'm not gonna lie. Oh, that's a jump down on water. We have an ability to jump down that way if we still desire. So then water's over here. Yeah. Shadow Wizard money. Oh, I can't do it. I'm gonna need a cup of tea and I'm gonna... I'm gonna need a fricking cup of tea. I'm nuking this...I'm nuking this place into oblivion. Yeah, that's what you get. Do I even have anything that does damage? Put me on fire, will you? Yeah, bam! Didn't even insult me like that. Right, what we got? What we got? What's the... A dungeon map? Well, I didn't even need it. Thanks anyway. Yeah, you're no grabbing me. You're no grabbing me. Good luck. No, no! Get me up the stairs. Get up the stairs, get up the stairs, get up the stairs, get up the stairs. Oh, why so many? A child's game, by the way. Right, fuck it, we're jumping over here. I don't know why we're jumping over here, but we're just going for it. We're sending it. Oh, okay, I'll take that. You now have three. Just collect one more and we'll get another unlock. We've got a city to burn. Scottish Rage Charging. No, no, I'm calm. I'm calm, I'm calm. Oh, I have to go down. Okay, I'll go down. See, you're not the only one that can jump your bams, honestly. Right, we went left, so now we have to go right. No, no, no, no, no, no. I don't even know where we are. I don't even know where we are. A freaking rock. At least I got a kingstone piece. Where the heck are we? Oh, fuck, fucks sake! We have fucking offerty. What the fuck do I need to go? Right, not that way. We'll go all the way back. As if you guys respawn! Yeah, we're definitely exploring. I'm getting like full health. No, no, not the fire though, not the fire though. As long as I don't get the fire, because as soon as you get given the fire, right. You perish. Alright, I know what to do. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Come on. Get in, get me in. Oh my god, how much health do you have? Ay, yay, yay! Followed me at the convention like... Jeez, I'm getting absolutely wrecked. This is probably the hardest... This has to be the hardest part of the game. Bro, this is getting outrageous. Oh, please don't run off the map, Link. I know your arse is on fire, but please... For me, for me, Link. For me, Linky-Poo. Whatever the heck is this wizard? That's the spells. Oh my god, right. There's a bomb that has to go here, I'm pretty sure. This is the worst. Literally, I have to admit, like, all of a sudden, this is, like, tedious. No game developer wants your game to be... Huh? Am I not? Oh, I have to... Easy. Easy, I'm just... Wow, I'm so skinny. Actually so skinny, so I had to hold my breath for that when I was like... I had to suck in, I had to go... Oh, there's the door! We're, like, right at the boss fight! I don't think I'm... It doesn't matter. Okay, we're right at the boss fight. We can do it! We're so close, replay! We're so freaking close! Right, so I don't need to do anything here. What do I need to do then? Oh! See you, jumping on my head. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, hug someone else. Where's my hug? Huh? I think I got another. What is it? I need to go back already. Wait, what's going on over here then? Hold on, I've missed something. I've missed a... I've missed a vital clue. What have I missed? A boomerang? Can boomerang even go over? Hello? Hit the switch with a bomb. As if that was the move! That wasn't even on the same pixel tail, like... That wasn't even on the same tail! How is that supposed to figure that out? Oh my god, they're paling me with money as a sorry. I need to drop down? Am I going crazy? I have to go up in order to go down, but only up and a little to the left. Okay... Up and a little to the left, so there's something to the...that can fall down up here. But I need to fall down on the left side. I come friend, I come friend! I'm learning, going! I need to fall here. Oh! I'm so fucking smart! And this game is just proving how smart I am. Alright, stop charging bro. I can't hit you if you're charging me. I can't hit you if you're charging me and I'm not full health. Oh! Bro! You're not even in the same tail as me! Glowy. I'm going to start dropping bombs. And the Legend of Zelda. The hit video game. Legend of Zelda. Well, I didn't... Can I just shoot? Link, sorry. Alright, how do I... Just jump? Oh! How am I supposed to make a mini jump? A mini jump. Okay, we did it, we did it. Shadow Wizard minigame. We look. Oh, I fucked that one up, didn't I? Yes, I fucked that one up. That was fine, I'll reset when we go up. I think this is the ball? I think? Please be easier. Oh my god, we're still going? Give it a break! Alright, sorry, sorry, sorry. I've got one fairy to my aid. I just need to not mess this up. Let's not mess this up. We should watch you play a puzzle game. It just ends up with me swearing. Okay, okay. I'm already seeing something that I need to. Some. Okay. Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay. Phase 1 already complete, question mark? Phase 1 complete, question mark. Please let me on. Do I need to get on? I don't know. Is that supposed to jump on that? I don't know. Nope. I'm not... What do you want from me? What do you want from me? What do you want from me? Do you want me to get on you? I don't know. Oh, okay. You've just killed me. I just refused to let me on you. Maybe I was supposed to jump on you? How is I supposed to know that? How is I supposed to know that? It's fine. I didn't need the HP. It's fine. I didn't need the HP. It's fine. I didn't need the HP. So the blue guy is not friendly. Go on and fucking spam it! I didn't do it. Oh, I didn't do it. Hold on. Hold on. I'm fucking dodging me. I'm fucking dodging. Wait, hold on. I don't want him to get me. Okay, here we go. Now jump on his back. Jump on blue. Okay, I'm on blue. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. You like that? You like that? You see that? Power and skill. Jump! Okay, it's fine. It's fine. I've got a fairy. I've got a fairy. I've got a fairy. Why the heck are there so many? I don't even remember. You need to jump. Please jump. Oh my god, please. Please. Please. Please! Why is he doing backflips? Fuck it! No! The HP can't take anymore! I might lose this. I'm not going to lie. I'm actually released. I'm not confident. I'm not confident. But that's not going to stop me. That's not going to stop me. Jump on his back. Okay, completely miss his back. It's fine. Okay, jump on his back. Okay, okay. Easy. Easy. Easy. Easy. Easy. Take it. No! Don't jump! Why would it not be sequenced to his freaking back? Why would you do that? Why would you do that? Get... Oh, I'm going to need calling a fairy. Get on his back right now. Jeez, love. Right, bro. If the game doesn't put me on his back, what do you actually want me to do? What do you want me... We ain't going to do it. I think I'm actually going to die here. Oh my god. Stop! He keeps, like, purposely going away. Oh, get to fuck. Oh my god, did we do it? Oh, thanks again for dropping me. No, it's fine. I didn't want to win. It's fine. Child's game, by the way. Child's game, by the way! And you just nuked my freaking allies. Ooh, it actually doesn't really seem to matter what... Oh my god, we did it. Don't ever make me do that again. Why was that so hard? My hands were sweating. My hands are literally sweating so much right now. Why was that so hard? Oh. Oh, it's a snail. That's wind? Is that wind? Why would the wind look like that? Shouldn't it not be, like, a cloud or, like, three little wings? You got the wind element! The wind carries the seeds of flowers scattering life across the lands. That's called wind dispersal on seeds. The wind element is the embodiment of that power. Yeah, me, though! Okay, we now have even more health, which I will take. Get me out here. Get me out. At last, we've got all four elements. Let's go revive the sacred blade. Now this is where everything goes to Judy Kaka. Bruh, I need a victory cup of tea after that. I'm not even kidding. I need a victory cup of tea. Hello, Elder. Now would you like to fuse? Poster check. Currently a shrimp, the way I like it. A chest in the graveyard? Yeah, yeah. I'll take it. I'll take it. Oh, they fit perfectly. Right. There's a tornado at the top of the winds. Receive the blade. I already did. I thought her dialogue was going to change, actually. Okay, I'll get ready. No, no, no. Kaka. Oh, we can trade with you as well. You want green. We destroyed like a billion monsters that need green. Or that drop green, sorry. Yes, I am going to basically do all the side stuff. Like, no. We'll play gacha. How about that? We'll play gacha for a bit. You guys have so much money. Thank you. Thank you, thank you. I'm going to upgrade our quiver size, not to be confused with you quivering last night to my audio. Thank you. Thank you. I'll be here all week. That's not even funny. Oh. Well, when I said it wasn't funny, you didn't have to actually announce that it wasn't funny. Okay. Mate, when I explore before, yes, I absolutely will. Where do we start? Like, where do we start? Tomato, tomato. There's still a few things you need but to fill store, but no, everything. Yes. Okay, the town hasn't gone to Shisa yet. So, I'm actually right. We have the cape. How the fuck do you get in here? I don't know how I get that. But yes, there is like, all the weasels floating about on itself. Do everything you've done before you completely hit the sword because this is the point of no return. I already did him and he gave me a heart, I'm pretty sure. The door's shut. We can't open it from the side. Why can't he open it from any other side either? Alright, let me upgrade our quiver size. Oh, the quiver. Yes, that. Kin stone the door, most likely. You are a big gender. There's a way you get in that house. Right. Oh, are we laundry? Hi, Link. If you have an empty ball, I can put one of my charms inside. Oh, that's cute. Oh, something red, so it's something good. You have to get every figure in the gacha. What does a butterfly do? What does a butterfly do? What does a butterfly do? I don't know. Oh, she's got to be laundry. Oh, wait, you're that ghost. I met your brother. Don't worry, I'm already looking for another job. Oh. I think we can also learn a new technique because we've got the cape now. Imagine watching like, I don't know how old Link is lore-wise, but imagine watching like a 12 year old jump of it with a cape. You have the cape. You have acquired a new skill. I'm ready to train you. Yes, I would like to train, please. Now I will teach you how to take three. The down thrust. First, equip the cape. Second, equip the sword. Jump, and then at your jump's peak, thingy. Yes, I understand. You see it, do you not? What does it do? I must possess you. Oh, no. Oh, I like that. Wait. Hold on a minute. Am I not AB? Okay, there we go. Sorry, sorry to be a little second there. My apologies, my apologies. Please do not look at me in the eyes. I'm rather embarrassed with that move. Joy butterfly's appear. Catch a joy, increase Link's speed while digging, swimming, or shooting. Oh, okay. There's nothing more I can teach you. Now you must train yourself. Okay, we can now go to the other masters to get trained up. Right, we'll do some gachapon, since we actually need to do it in order to get full health. Are you guys feeling lucky? Oh, hello. Yeah, trade. I really wish you could do it all in one go, and before we get like another one that we already have. Gambit time. Down throws. Big octa rock. Octa rock is such a good ASMR trigger word. Octa rock, octa rock, octa rock. I'll be saying that in my next ASMR video. Octa rock. Gambit time. What are we going to get? What are we going to get? We're going to get Percy. Which I didn't actually solve his problem. I'm pretty sure he doesn't have access to his house or something. If you put extra in it increases your odds of not getting a duplicate. I don't want to burn through it too much. Although we do seem to be getting like tons of stuff anyway. Strony calling you a good octa rock ASMR win. Oh no, I never looked. Oh, I wasn't paying attention. Sorry, I didn't see what we just unlocked there. I like your outfit, Strony. Thanks. I didn't model it myself. I had no say. But I like the bikini. With the tape kind of thing. Okay, we got rope. Not to be confused with Chibi. T minus seven minutes until your beloved milfs are live together. Playing the most predictable game of all. Jelly bean game. I'm actually a big fan of color combinations. I'm drawing you right now. Oh yeah? You like my green? My vert? Is this in French or vert? It's vert. 91% probability. Look, 90% is not really high. Anything above 50% is like a one and two. Although then again, you guys did see my luck. The third time I freaking got it. Yeah, you better buy that freaking figurine. At least you get money if you pull up the same thing again. And what happened? Exactly. I can't. Oh! The great dragonfly. Dragonfly Vechiver? I'm actually kind of down. Dragonfly Vechiver. How would she look? Would she have a toggle to open up her wings? I mean, I like that. Dragonfly Vechiver. I don't think I've heard of a dragonfly Vechiver. Oh, the forest bakori. Very elegant and ladylike. Would a dragonfly be a milf? Wait a minute! The dragonfly would be a milf because if you didn't know, dragonflies are the most successful predator. Oh my god, I need someone who's in a shot or corner to play her. Oh, that would be outrageous. Yeah, that's fucked. Yeah, that'd be outrageous. But that's funny as fuck. And before I even put, oh, I'm triggered. Oh, go fuck off me. I'm just leaving about. I've actually been getting in a model in Wings and 3D. Dragonfly Vechiver. Munker. Hire me, I'll do it, I'll do it. A to A, geez, the probability going down. As long as it's not a blight. A little too far. Oh, all right. Okay, okay. My bad. Speaking of dragonfly. So he gives me five rupees every time I have a duplicate, which I should be the goose. Prey and Mantis Vechiver. They don't have, I don't like Prey and Mantis. Not far enough. Oh, it's Mama's Cafe. This is the best place in Tentorite. She can also pick up some good tips. I actually love this little cute save mission thing. It's actually really sweet. I know it's not like, sweet, sweet, but. 87% Not far enough. For anyone who is lurking and is like, what on earth are you doing? We have finally unlocked all the items in the Legend of Zelda Minish Cap and we are currently just doing all the side missions because if we progress the story any further, basically everything goes to Judi Kaka and it's not very nice section of the game and the game unfortunately is one of those games that reverts back every time you load up the same save. So the town will not be restored and you'll constantly have the ability to do the boss fight type thing. And I'd rather have it fun time. The Wind Tribe. God, this is so like 9. I wonder how long development took on this game. I feel like a lot of love went into it. You know, a lot of love, a lot of hard work tears. I never heard anything bad about the development of Game Boy games, to be honest. But then again, I guess back then you never really ask those kind of questions. Like, oh, is, you know, how was development? How is this? How is that? Like it was all insider thingy. But now like development teams in that are being so open and honest and like saying like this is what's happening, this is what we're doing next, the type thing. It came, it took Nintendo two years to come up with this beautiful game. That's fantastic. It really is a beautiful game. Really, really. I love it. They're paying you rupees for JPEGs, honestly. I think this came out. Pina Hyrule's Fruit Vendor. She hates vegetables. She won't even sell tomatoes even though they technically are fruits. Freak! Oh my god, Nintendo! Steady on, some folk just dinny like certain palettes. You know, everyone's tongues a wee bit different. Oh my god, that is a Nintendo. Well, literally, they're brutal. They like their fresh veggies. Mayor Hagen, the mayor of the town of Hyrule, he's a big collector of odd mass. He's built a shelter in his garden just in case monsters attack Hyrule. He knew. Is he a body? She a fur diver. Every time I hear that I am Jingle, I'm the last one trailing off forever. Meeps. Nintendo went crazy for that one. Hagen Love, you liked that the mayor of the town does nothing? Oh, and Eni and Meenie, the high-reliant vegetable growing in their fields are exquisitely delicious. Apparently, Brocco sells some of their crops. They've got like little lore for all the townsfolk. Oh come on, give me a game where it's about restoring a town, please. I'd love it. I'd go absolutely. Oh, there's this game that's coming out that's called like... It's like a hotel game. You run it. Oh, Stockwell and his wee pup. Oh my god, he's called Stockwell because he's well-stocked. There's this hotel coming out, but it's like you're playing Vampire or something. And I don't know if it's in Early Access right now or they're about to do Early Access. Sheebie is live. Is there a... Ezlo has Link, a young boy on a quest with Ezlo to restore the four swords with the sword's power he hopes to remove the curse of Princess Zelda. Join Sheebie and Ezra live on Fall Games. Yes, if you want to play with Sheepsters and Ezra on Fall Guys, you can do that right now. I kid you not, they are doing it right now. As long as you don't mess up tea. Yes, we are literally just playing Zelda and finishing the main quest and all that today. I don't know how long it's going to take. I thought it was only going to take four hours, but considering we're at the two hour mark and I've made no progress, um, yeah. It's fine. It's fine. This might be a little bit of an endurance stream. Dr. Le, a gruff talking academic type who says he's studying the PCORI. He doesn't seem to be aware that they're actually living in his own house. Aw. If you're looking for an older RPG that has rebuilding, look into... look at Dark... look at Dark Cloud or Dark Chronicle. Oh, I love like the repair ability in Assassin's Creed Brotherhood and Assassin's Creed 2. You get to like repair either Monty Regione or Rigatoni, whatever you want to call it. Scissorblades, that's actually a pretty good name for them. Or you get to repair like Roma and I really like that aspect of like fixing it up and like the environment changes as you fix stuff up and like you go on quest to do it. I would absolutely love to develop some kind of game around that. I've not met you yet. A great butterfly... oh no, in the Minish Woods. I have met you. Oh, I didn't realize the fairies were different types. Like a dragonfly, a butterfly. So what's the... is it the blue one I've not met yet? No progress blasts through that part of the game. I mean, we got the last elemental, that's all we need. Past that coded... Bro just said Rigatoni. Oh, sugar, that was a joy butterfly. I probably could have read that, honestly, but... We're trying to get through it. What's our percentage now? 75%, ooh. It's getting low. How low can you go? How low can you go? Not exactly retro, but Bastion has a little bit of that and it's a good game. I haven't played Bastion. I don't... the only Bastion I've played is... Shoulda picked Mercy. Shoulda picked any kind of support. We ended up losing. All your fault, your tears are what I live for. Leaver appears in Wild Runes real full. These baddies are really underground. You never know where they might pop up. Keep your shield raised and ready. Your race will win, Stan. I wanna be Winston. Uh... Lucky 2. Lucky 2 appears in the sky. I can't move, but they throw lightning bolts, steal their clothes with the gust star. Oh, like how it actually gives you a base on how it flew. Oh, Monkers. Monkers, I've got DMs in the discord. What does it mean? Um... Oh, okay, it's just one of the girls requesting something. That's fine. And Shibi might be cooking up something that I wholeheartedly support. So I might need to get her a few assets for that, which is perfectly fine. My apologies, a little bit distracted. I can't believe it. Shibi, unbelievably, came up with a concept that I actually was considering. But it wasn't possible for me to do it because of timing issues, I didn't have enough time to pursue such a project. However, Shibi just came out with it and I was like... I've not told her that I actually had an interest in that, but I will 100% support it if she's interested in it. I'm not really sure how to go about it though, because it's a bit hot to track down. But yes, we'll see. We'll see how it goes. You just killed him, I did. Please read it out loud. No, I can! Don't get me wrong, I'm a blabbermouth. I can hardly hide anything that I'm interested in. But that is not a project that a beetle appears in various areas. It is not for me to spill beans about. I spill many beans, and I flick many. But that's not for me. Probably 50% and then we'll take a break, I'll go get a honey tea because my wee voice box is already... Oh, Nairu! Nairu, she's looking for a house in Hyrule to move into. She's a descendant from a line of oracles of the land of Labriana. I'm going to say that's probably a reference to another Zeldor game that I've not played. Yes, probability 50% and then we'll have a quick break. Beans and tea all over. Oh, okay. Vacuum pumped beans, no thank. Do you have anything cooking which not even the girls know about? Oh, I've already heard that one. Um, that the girls don't know about? I have monthly events. I did post the old monthly events, but some of them are outdated and can no longer be utilized. Oh no, our probability dropped. We'll have to get two in a row that we've had. So, in July is Minecraft server with the girls. The video game comes out as long as we don't hit any issues. Aw, peaceful Hyrule. I love that I just got back and you're talking about our flicking beans. Oh no, I'm not. Broly legend. I'm talking about beans on toast. Cause I'm British. Thank you for the tip of the super chat. I'll take it. Is the Minecraft server going to have mods or be vanilla? I think Emmy might want it to have mods. I always like vanilla, but it's up to her. I guess it's up to her. Whatever she wants to do. Shaders are instance based, so she puts shaders on. I don't have to see it. 68% on probability. We're getting there. We're getting lower. And after yesterday, I thought Stranny wasn't vanilla. I'm not that bad. I didn't think it was that bad. What was that? Just... When does the Veil or Game come out and where can I purchase it? It is free to play. It will come out on itch.io and you will know about it. Ah, sugar! We're really starting to hit the repeats. Since you said you wanted vanilla Minecraft. Azura's Dona Thon is the event for August, although I am going to try and ask if a VTuber that does game shows will host a game show for us. I just need to get all the assets together. If you didn't know, in order to have a high acceptability rate on collabs, if you do all the work, people are much more likely to accept. I currently have to do that and put it all together. I basically have to reach out and be like, hey, do you want to host all the Veil or girls in a collab? None of us will stream it, so you'll get all the views. Oh, by the way, I've actually planned out the entirety of the game show, so all you have to do is take these assets and files and put them where they belong and then you get to have everything. Yeah, basically. So I'm going to try and get that done. I don't know if they're going to accept the person that I do want to host it is going to accept. Because they are incredibly busy with projects all the time. But you know what, in this world, if you don't ask and be a cheeky shit, you don't get... I was talking to Hexa because she was going to do a watch along, but she felt ill or she had to go to hospital and all of that. And I just checked up on her and I was like, I hope you're doing all right now. And I was like, I know this is cheeky but do you want to do an ASMR collab? And she was like, fuck you. And I'm like, oh, okay, shit. Like, if you don't ask and you don't get in this world, people might be like, I'm so embarrassed to be rejected by someone for not doing a collab or whatever. Bruv. Bruv. Either they'll say yes or no. And guess what? If they say no, that's not a reflection of your character, that's not a reflection of your work, that's not a reflection of your content. Someone might just know before it and that's okay. Like, then you'd be afraid to put yourself out there. Like, literally, I've got what? Six ASMR collabs planned? I mean, I'm about to reach out to more folk. Aww. Cat-less Link. I hate that I put Link in all caps now. This is killing me on the inside. ASMR in the hospital but you missed 100%. No, she's not in hospital, then who? Will there be a link on Discord? Actually, I don't know. Discord. I can't... The main viewer on Twitter can't talk about it but all the girls alts can talk about it. But yeah, then there's another seven ASMR collab coming out. Well, there's actually three more in the works. I'm waiting for this animator to come back because they're taking their sweet arse time and it's kind of just holding up the old Oh, Farori. Farori, she's looking for a house. We're sure to got one. Looking for a man in finance. Eh, right. Want to do... What percentage are we at? When can I make my cup of tea? 62%. Okay, we're getting there. Once we hit 50%, cup of tea time. Do I make myself clear? You will all get up, you will all stretch your legs, you will all go and poop poop. Well, I don't know how fast you can go a poop poop. We're at 100 rupees because we're absolutely burning through it. Sadly, you cannot give all three a house. I know! It's absolutely nonsense. And I realise I actually shouldn't have put that green girl in a house because her reward is she can dye your clothes a certain colour but we're already green. So why does she even offer that as a reward? Who knows? One of them. We're at 61%. Let's go, let's go, let's go. I already have popcorn. Do I have to stretch? Yes, everyone has to stretch. What? Goron merchant. Oh no! I just realise we haven't helped that poor Goron. Right, we're going to do it. He needs more buddies. We'll get more buddies. I think what we'll do is we'll take everything like one at a time. 60% we're getting down to the 50s. The 90s. A mountain pokori! Does it mention their Scottish? Their song is actually a saying that they are fully fledged mountain minish now. Oh. Ting, ting, ting along. Dun, dun, dun, dun, dun. What are we at? We're at 59. Oh, we're at 59. We're getting there. You can choose. You can have, close whatever colour you want as long as it's green basically. You have to choose the buff to win. You already helped him twice. I know but doesn't he not end up with like six pals or something at one point? I basically need to dig in all the mobiles and then trade a Kinstone with the walls. I'm like 100% sure that's how we got his first buddy. I just got you so don't do that again. This is why we don't catch her. Get your phone, get your phone. How many would you like to see? How many would you like to see? Wager one. Does Scotland have mountains? Yeah, we have Ben Nevis. It is the highest mountain and a young woman tends to her cuckoos. If you help her, gather, she'll give you a reward. Yes, she will give money. Yes, there is a mountain called Ben Nevis in Scotland and people climb it. I don't think it is definitely not severe. Don't you think it's Mount Everest or anything like that? It's definitely not severe. But Scotland's very hilly. Wheaton and pitta. The couple baked bread and high roll. Their tasty pastries hold a secret. If you're extra lucky, they'll be a helpful item inside. I like that. Poor Goron having to rely on wishes to get some pals. Oh no! Oh! The Vealur account finally tweeted out all our mascots and I could see everyone together. Did you know Snowberry's mascots are actually the tallest and biggest out of us all? Out of the reflames, the snippets, etc. I think it goes um Who's the smallest? I think Pin Pals. Then the... Oh no! Hold on. Herum, Pin Pals, reflames, snippets, bleeding hearts, and Snowberries in size. So we... Snowberries are the biggest out of us all. They're big boy. No, reflames aren't the smallest. There was a height chart created. I'll need to ask the freaking concept artist. Um, because Emmy, some of you caught it, but Emmy's loading screen on her background music was the mascot that was concepted, but she made her Pin Pals the way they look now. So I had to get an updated loading screen and all that like very quickly. But her background music, it was too late. We didn't have time to alter it because we had those assets. There was a miscommunication with the asset maker Yumi. Yumi's fantastic by the way. I absolutely loved working with her. But there was a miscommunication. I was like, hey, the deadline's May 1st. And she thought the deadline was June 1st and I'm like, no, that was the debut date and it caused a bit of a back walk. Um, but we actually had that issue. I had that issue with a lot of artists who were making assets. Ball and Chain Soldier, whatever you CBT your way off the map because they didn't want to see you again. I had a lot of issues when the debut date was announced to be June 1st. All artists either saw that and went, oh, I can take my time with my work. And it was like, no, I'm still asking for you to do it by the deadline I gave you, which was more than fair. But everyone unanimously. So if you're an artist that worked with us and you're listening right now, don't feel bad because everyone fricking did it. And everything backlogged to May. My birthday was actually supposed to be when I was making shorts for everyone and that didn't happen. I was also supposed to pre-make all my like, thank you ASMRs, that didn't happen. Because everything got clogged into me. So it was a fricking developmental nightmare. My mother's birthday. Yeah, June 1st. My birthday now, get wrecked. I don't know. You know, in the last dungeon, honestly. Your deadline is like, do not force me to move. Yes, I was not budging on debut. I'm sorry. I was not delaying any further. Man, miss the reflins, okay? I needed to be at my reflins the rose. Sorry. Sorry, I can't, I can't say what I'm doing right now. Wait, back to Gambo. It's spain, everything's spain. Everything's spain. Everything is spain. Everything's cool when you're part of the team. You're almost at 8k, I bloody hope not. I was like, I'll be able to get the clap and ASMR out right now. Music Music Music Music Music Music Music Music Music Music Music Music Music Sorry, I'll make a cup of tea in a minute 51% on the thing Stony would be the killest boss ever No, I know how I'm feeling right now. I'd be a terrible boss then I Yes right 51% on the percentage over Gacha, please do not gamble.

I don't uh, I don't know they're They're cats really performative animals Um I have had to teach them to let me pick them up. So I was Had a weird like stance of like, oh, I won't pick up my cat because they don't like it type thing But then I realized if there was ever an emergency I need them to be able to leap into my arms Um, thankfully no emergency is ever occurred.

Oh, they aren't no it takes it takes a long time for a cat If you think of it imagine something eight times your size picking you up like it's quite it's quite a lot But over time over time There's normally only one pair of caverns Anything else Oh Yes, but you have to teach us to H3o H3o H, you know H3o is technically right. Hello I'm the hermit Do you do anything else? No, okay. He just sits here. He's just happy to be here Um, I think that's all we can do on the mountain because up ahead is like actual like quest and stuff We've already seen the fairy So I guess we'll go to the swamp already. Yeah All right Okay, now that we can swim Okay, this is just a snake room If only you were eight times my size, I'll wait until you hear about a zoo's lore Okay, there's a little thing here Back in the tiny Oh, this is a vast map though Oh a booty fly you call a joy you can now dig faster than before Are you squid mirroring? Curious I am rewatching the member stream of the forbidden tail list I didn't realize you had a gen 2 commission waiting. I already tipped on it, but here is some extra chocolate luck Wait, what? 500 am I I need my glasses on unironically where my is that actually say 500 or are you fucking trolling right now? Holy shit, what the fuck? 500 that are for love. Thank you. Hello. What the ink literally what the ink? 500 Um, I've kind of I've said this before I'm happy to fucking hell 500. Thank you. Jesus um I have said this before But basically we make a route a racially and this is terrible. This is the only way you can describe it We make a racially ambiguous person and then And then we can chocolate fire them if they're chocolate because you can't have a white chick on a chocolate But you can have a chocolate on a white chick Example she be chocolate But she be she be she be's cooking um Holy sugar. Ah, that is a lot of money. Thank you No, it's true. No, it's true. It's true. It's true You can't have a white chick on a chocolate, but you can have a chocolate on a white chick, you know what I mean Surely that makes sense. That was a sense, right? Uh, right we need to dig under there Wait what now? Yeah, no, it does make sense. Yeah. Yeah, okay good I might have said it the wrong way by accident, but you know what I mean Uh Oh Right, is there a box 50 I'll take it 50 We live in a society Honestly, I don't mind like I remember when the eyes were teased of the models and someone quote tweeted it and they were like Oh my god, they're actually coming out with a chocolate And like it really made me think like Holy shit, y'all motherfuckers don't get any love, do you? Um Because everyone's too busy being weird about it. Um, but it just wasn't even a it wasn't even a second thought like um, so as I said Azura was designed chocolate But we then when it came to model production, we made her racially ambiguous Because we didn't have a choice. Okay, we didn't have a choice. We had to make her racially ambiguous because we didn't know who was gonna get her but Um We could make maker chocolate. Um Am I being trolled? I'm being trolled. Um, sorry puzzle time. Hold on. Um, and basically like not to give anything away, but um You know, then you'd be surprised if another racially ambiguous pops up. Um Because just Not many designs really Wow, what's this? A dojo. Hello Swordsman ship is spirit. I am the finest or Maybe second finest swordman scar blade. Oh because he's got a scar. I like that. Thank you again for that tip Fucking 500 that's insane. Please do not tip anymore. That is an insane amount of money. Thank you though. I really appreciate it. Um But yes, um Basically ambiguous slash chocolate or eating well at veiler. I assure you headquarters are Looking after you. What am I doing spin blade? You speed up your great spin charge. You won't have to hold the button as long anymore Oh, what? That's so fast Is she edible? We need more chocolate. Well, I thought I thought you weren't so right This is just me being dumb like surprise surprise me being dumb named better joe. Um But I thought That you weren't supposed to say like chocolate and all that But then when azura came out and everyone was like chocolate chocolate. I'm like, oh wait, so chocolate's fine to say Because I didn't know But now I'm like, yeah chocolate Um But yes, right. We've already been there. That's fine. Um So, okay, we did unlock a few bits and bobbies here. Okay, we locked like a lot of bits and bobbies And some people find out I thought they did too, but then everyone was like, yeah chocolate and I was like, oh, right Okay, we're doing this right. Okay. Okay chocolate. Let's go chocolate. Yeah, chocolate feature first Let's go like I didn't know Um, but like, you know, I'm glad. Uh, yes, you please do not worry about a azura being the only Rashly ambiguous or chocolate. Um, you eat well at veal or I assure you that much um, and She be mere may not have something in the work smile smile. She may have something in it I just gonna be one of those things where I go po po po po po and it doesn't work and That's the weirdest shit I've ever heard Okay, let's go this way I think it has to do with fetishize and finkle a rich normally isn't what they want, but they're not veal or it's a fine Yeah, maybe I should ask Azura and she stares Um, okay.

Yes, I understand Okay, let's go position It's a day ending in why so strong any forces are we flings for another 12 hour endurance stream no sleep blood I like the stories where they're like, oh I fell asleep at the start of your stream and then I got to wake up to you And I'm like, oh Okay, I like hurricane spin. That's so good My wings are like a hurricane That's a that's a hobbit with wings the smoke. No, there's nothing more.

You can now shoot arrows faster than before. Oh, I like that There was something I was supposed to do back here and I didn't do it out of pure laziness. I'm sorry Oh, I need to finish my teeth. I almost forget You guys are just so interesting that you're like, I don't think I've ever had like a nice pipe and perfectly temperature tea I actually woke up from a nap earlier go waking up to use one of the pillagers I think yeah, someone sent me a marshmallow and they're like, it's actually really nice that no matter what time of day I get the opportunity to catch you live and I'm like, damn like that sounds like I'm like Addicted and like online all the time Also, me who is like, yeah, if you two didn't have vodishes, I'd probably pull you for like 14 hours Yeah, like stream for 14 hours. Yeah Maybe I do have a problem But it's a problem If it has if it's good, you know Yeah Yes, having a good day. Oh, I'm having a good day We're currently mucking about going back to see if we can pick up more hearts before we do this boss fight We are now missing 16 pieces, which is actually still quite a decent amount in all honesty um Unfortunately, I'm not aware where I missed. I need to trade quite a few Kinstone like there's a few waterfalls and stuff to the Right side of the map that I haven't unlocked. So You start when I finish working most of the time I just get to watch almost all of the streams that's good timing Shawnee's the best problem to have it's not a problem if we're all enjoying it If it's ever a problem and you need to you need to make your Your issues heard just go on my alt twitter and see if it's a problem after listening Oh, I just realized link blinks even though you're afk Okay, finish the tea. Let's see what I am missing We don't need to deal with that Is there anything hidden back there? Not that I can tell Okay, there's quite a few bits and bulbs here. Ow. Don't do that again Okay, there we go 200 that's fantastic Oh get your pawn work. Oh, no, we don't have access. This is definitely a Kinstone Oh, and there's a beanstalk as well Oh, sorry, I didn't know I thought he was perished but he's not No, come on There we go Uh, wait, don't you be small over here? Oh, wow, I do need to be small from over here Okay, let's take a little meter You start streaming just around the time I'm able to get to my pc after work It's like seven company will I get to raw at my desk bro raw after work all you need to I used to be physically mentally drained after my wee shifts at the cafe Although working on the care homes actually probably rougher on the mental and But my favorite thing about being a waitress was like you'd be like I forgot the water for table seven when you're like going to bed and trying to sleep. You're like, oh, no Um, I always like laugh at those memories. You got a piece of heart make four Oh I still actually I still remember I served this couple um and there was a few Waitress and waitresses waitress I I don't know. There was a few of us on the floor But all of us unanimously assumed each other had gotten to that table And they were sitting waiting for 20 minutes on nothing and I was More like I felt so bad. I'm like felt so freaking bad. Honestly. Wait. I just under your turn. Um And I still think about that couple to this day I feel so sorry But basically they all made me go because I was the youngest and they were like, well, they're not going to be pissy Yeah, like a young waitress type thing. So I had to go but they were actually still like super nice. Um, and Um Because the owner worked with us like I explained the situation and we didn't charge them for drinks type thing Like I think it's called cop pain or something like when you don't get the person to um Right, we need to switch off this guy Because he'll run ahead which you really shouldn't do um I bet you made bank getting all the tips because you're so charming. Well, funny you mentioned that I had, um A co-worker who used to send me to get payments from folk because I was like a A peer very young and I look very young um And he was like, oh, they never tip me because I'm a guy but you're a chick So they'll tip you they'll tip you so you go out and get them to pay like say oh It's your turn to pay and all that and And I It actually did work. Like I think we tried it and it definitely worked And you know Strongly useful. Yes, I have a face of bobby Oh Because it's cutting the grass. Oh, there's a bill. All right. Okay. It's fine Harris I think there's an enemy in one of these Shawnee didn't hit no from the start Not quite Of course it works. They proved it in mythbusters. Wait, they didn't mythbusters that you get more tips if you're a chick I believe it. Oh bomba. How much bomba? What 100 bomba? That's actually pretty too much I just realized I haven't been checking the maps There's treasure in the left In the left There's treasure that I've not picked up. Okay. I'm actually kind of glad I've actually not gone back into the other temples Oh, there's treasure in here. What's the treasure? It's a freaking trap shadow wizard money gang We love kissing spells They got me Yay, we got you shells Okay. Well, that was actually kind of lucky because that I didn't wait. Is there like a thing here? Oh, there is Shawnee's passive, let me take your money If you're cute and nice Yeah, like I used to read the reviews and I always got mentioned in the reviews like ah, sorry I took so much pride in my movie waitress job Like I know some people might like well You guys wouldn't because you guys are reeflands and you guys get up But like some people then like oh it used to be a waitress like all you did was serve and like used to clean toilets at the end of the day And I'm like, yeah, I used to take pride in my work. I love my job. It was so fun and everything was like such a nice experience and Yeah, and I got to talk to people from all around the world because um it was like a tourism cafe and Like fuck yeah, I enjoyed my job like let's fuck up. Never anyone You know, some people are like embarrassed about their tail. I'm like no, I haven't made some time like it's a fuck size But like it's so fun No one should be ashamed of their job not then maybe like literally like I've never been thinking about it was like because I think if you ever like if If you talk to someone who's like never had a job before and they're like, oh you used to have to clean toilets Yeah, it's just part of the job like Someone's taking a fat job a although I will say one thing I had a really good boss if someone's fucking bombed the toilet. No, I didn't have to clean it Because my boss was so good like if it was like absolutely fucking nasty as fuck my boss would do it I don't trust this room Oh, well, there you go No, my boss was amazing It was literally a Change my life unironically. I know it sounds silly, but saying like oh that job changed my life But I like it actually unironically that they'll change like trajectory Um, because I was like very unconfident. I was like so unsure of myself. So How did I miss this? This is out in the open Right, let's go south see what happens Ow How did I bump off the edge of the map? Right, I'm pretty sure we're supposed to dig here Oh in the money Hello, we get to buy another couple of shells with that 800 coins for that But here uh fairies jump out of those things as well here Sorry, please don't shoot me. I'm just a little guy Because you ignored everything basically they got kinstones open. How dare you how dare you accuse me of my terrible gameplay Even though I've shown it here in 4k Literally dropping the album having a good boss makes everything so much easier. Oh, tell me about it Like at the care home Look, I'm just saying if you ever want to do the care home I'm pretty sure they committed like paycheck fraud with me and because when I like wrapped up my employment um, I got like extra 500 great British pounds and I had to phone them up and be like you've overpaid me like you've paid me my Like my wages when I've not worked with you and they were like no no just take it and I'm like What do you mean just take it like a phone during everything no no just take it just So basically when I departed from the care home, I got like extra 500 quid from day nothing We are going to go spend all this money because this is it. Do you mind you're literally in my way in my way Okay, you can't actually run off into the next segment A little saucy. Oh, it was saucy. All right and I'm not going to complain an extra 500 quid in my pocket. They made me I was off on one and Put it in my wee bank account. Right. We're gonna buy Out what shells we can because we have far too much money and nothing to spend on Yeah, care homes are an absolute mess like they constantly change hands of management They constantly change companies and all of that They're constantly understaffed a stupid diss amount of understaffing Um, and they do it on purpose to maximize like earnings and all of that And it's like, you know who suffers the actual folk in the care home suffer because It's just chaos like from and the shifts are 12 hour. Oh, forgive me keep them this The shifts are 12 hours as well like sorry But the human body is tired after six hours and you're asking like four people to look after like How much elderly like 60 elderly on a ward type thing? Oh, it's absolutely crazy Oh, it's like that all over the world. So it's no it definitely is all over like it's pretty outrageous. How many Okay, we're gonna do five gamble We must be getting close to being done unless I'm like completely just blown smoke It Okay Yeah, let's get that probability up because that is uh, there's not even a point in doing the 1% probability Wait, is it gonna am I not gonna be able to achieve 100% if I put 99 in Big green to chew By all the monster adventure manuals Is that what the post office thing was when she was charging me 200 quid for and I was like not on your bike in Link between worlds lets you peg his his dash between screens if you play.

They're they're pretty cute scammed. No, honestly, they're pretty cute Uh Copy them I like flower games like I like games that are like oh the store nature Dude in town There's no someone in town In minnish town Your name will go down in history as a flower scientist Called botanist. I'm a big botanist. Someone's got booty. I see I've got a big round Uh, didn't didn't turn cells in there cells flower I The flowers make me think oh Keep toughen away into the evening Did it did nothing actually happen other than unlocking these flowers, I mean, that's cute, but I Flower guy in town In minnish town You want to trade no I've been asking the same people all over and over. Please. Do you want to trade please please? I'm getting desperate and castles in high rule I New guy in town I'm looking I'm observing There's no new gentleman in time you're teasing me No one wants to link them Uh There is a game where you can dodge the bird if you want I always remember things not funny again Oh, it's the library Did you jump in the bell? I did jump in the bell I'm gonna unlock the next edition Welcome. Yes. Yes. Yes. I've almost finished Right, we'll go bottom left. No, no, I didn't mean it but thanks. Oh, I appreciate it Um, we'll go bottom left and the reason for that is because there was a few dig sites we unlocked Uh, there's a up here Man, just let me cut the grass in peace. Okay Some of us need to to feed their gacha habit and if I'm going to fund it by cutting grass then just leave me to it Okay. Oh, there we go. That's what we'll see. Wee Okay All right fallen trees All right, this one's Wow Soon soon Wait, that was a swamp. That was the guy's house And then this one did we dig up we might have already done that A bomb place. How do you guys spot the bomb places so easily? A bomb place Oops, a bomb place That's here A bomb place Can you be this zero in a bit? I've already been in here Nope to the right Aww Oh Get in the bowl, hen. Thank you She's me just going for a dip plus I watch you lovely ladies flutter about I still don't get how you guys see that honestly. I would never have caught that Um We can dig this up, nice, nice, huge, is that everything for the sweet region here? It was? Oops, sorry. Is that literally everything I've unlocked? I just need to fuse stones with people, but I don't know where they're located, basically. Hold on, just checking. Right, I need to finish the post office, and I need to talk to that wife and get a charm off of her. I need to finish the gacha, which I'm literally about to do. I've not finished off the gorom, which is a shame. The lake, apparently, is finished off. Bro, I'm just shite, as it clearly is. Is there any mythical features in Foch Foch, or tons? Kelpies are probably the most well-known. Um... Kelpies are horses that convince you to ride their back, and then you drown. So basically, like, marry me. Um... Right, we have 300 rupees. Let's go talk to this wife, and let's go get the latest issue. We've got one more? Hello, we've got a new issue, yes? Yes, thank you, I would like it. Um, right, we're actually going to purposefully fail a gacha, so we can make 10 rupees. I've got 190, and it's 200 for an addition. So we're going to purposefully fail this, okay? We're going to purposefully fail this, please don't worry. It is all by design. The difference is Kelpies eat you after you drown. Marry me to do that too. Yeah, that's fine. Okay, yes, yes, yes. Okay, we need one, we just need to fail one more. And before I win it, could you imagine? I curse you with good luck, 3% probability. That would be blessed. You raid their back and they drown you, basically. So Kelpies are like, marry me to drown you in water. How many shells, right? Let's get to work. It's a hippocampus, so it murders in time. Name to eat shells to get one correct gacha. The classic red cap goblin is also a Scottish myth. Big blue choo-choo appears in the temple of the droplet. It's an ordinary blue choo-choo, faking him, minnish sizes, daunting. Just try to avoid the electric. Congrats, I'll keep the figurine in case you can see it anytime. Wanna try again? Yes, I think I have enough, question mark. We do have enough. Yes, name to eat, give me that little lever. Kelpies are squashful. King Daltas. Congratulations, I'll keep the figurine in case you can see it anytime. Do we have enough? We do have enough for another roll. Wanna try again? I absolutely would love to. Yes, please. Oh, no. Oh, well. Okay, 2% gacha. Wish us luck. 2% gacha. Yeah, surprise, surprise. Yeah, I don't think so. I think there's legit like 4 missing. 1, 2, 3. 3, wow. Okay, 3 more. 2% is better odds than a gacha 5 star. Well, after this, it's literally 2 more and we're done. We are done with gacha. We can finally access that room. The third last one is... Aw, Ren's sleep. Ren's shoe shop. Using a secret technique, he makes shoes in his sleep. Princess Zelda is his thing. His biggest source of income. That's cute. Okay. We are out of shells so we can't do it again until we get a few more. But literally 2 more to go feels good, man. Oh, hello, Popper. You're in the way. In the way. Yeah. Nope, you're straight back in the way. Yep, there you go. Oh, wait. We're gonna talk to her so she gives us her blessing thing because she does... Yes. We're just gonna use that so she can give me the charm. What does it do? Blue Link can't hurt you. He isn't real Blue Link. That is cursed. And last but not least, yes, give me it. And then that's fully gone. All done. What do you see now? You now have the full collection of layers, but I guess you must know all kinds of stuff now, huh, Professor? Are you flirting with me? I will... I will perish right now. Let's see. No one... No one wants to link our cheeky stones. I'm really struggling to find anyone who wants to do it. Read. Do you want me to read? Oh, I'll go and take another one. Purple Burglar Alarm Link. No, you don't want to trade either. You still need to buy the Goron... What? Did I really have nowhere else to go? I don't know if I should just go back to that field and farm it, that one that's like to the west. Did you dock with the Minish in the bookshelf? I think so. I'll just go back to make sure. Make sure. I've seen games with a 1 in 15,000 drop. See, that just like completely turns me off. I'm like, well, I'm without lucky, so what's the point? I wouldn't even spend my pennies on it. I'll see if there's any we Minish. Actually, I do need to go back to the mining village because I think there possibly had been someone that might want to... Oh, there's a wee guy up there, maybe he wants to... You're still playing this. I went to bed when you started. Well, you must have got a terrible sleep. There's only been seven hours, you need eight. Okay, we'll go back. We'll go back to the mines after this. The children yearn for the mines. I did have a terrible sleep. Exactly, see? Reminds me of how I thought I could get the woodcutting pen. Oh, so you passed the trial and returned. I'm so jealous. But if you're going on an adventure, there's no one better to learn for the elder. He's so manly, so rivally, and so full of fire. Oh, it's green though. It's not very important if it's green, unless I'm mistaken. Oh, I'm not back at the swamp. Come on, have you never been to the swamp so many times? No, it's just for jewelry. Jewelry for gems. Well done indeed. You're almost as surprised as I was at your age. How about again? No? No, I can only do it once and it was green. I wasn't even an important one. Get out of my swamp. I mean, honestly, we're what? Missing three heart containers? That's not that bad. It could be way worse. I feel like three heart containers is pretty good. I actually have no clue what I'm missing, but... Maybe. Just maybe we do the boss. Because when does Mercy come on? We've got T minus two hours for Mercy, so... I will get the last gacha, though. I want to do the gacha part. Addicted, I know. I'm gonna cut grass for the gacha. I can't believe I'm saying this one. I'm a way to cut grass for gacha. Oh my god, that's when you know it's bad. Start doing manual labor. Terrible. They're not dropping anything. As if he hits me. See, these guys are so in awe. Go and just perish me. I need 200 coins to buy 30 more. This is gonna take forever this way. Why didn't you get the rest of the red rupees at the bean? Oh, I don't know where that bean is. My inventory was full, so I didn't want to pick up anymore. Me wallet was full. Can't believe it. I'm at 41. This is gonna take forever cutting grass. Was it this one? If it was, that's incredibly lucky. Oh, I'm beating them up. If it was this one, then... How much do I need? Shell. Oh, I need quite a few more to be honest. Oh wow, I just cut that arrow in the air. I wonder how much time on my life I spent cutting grass and Zelda. Link gets the job cutting grass. Okay, that'll help out quite a bit. That was, we've got 230 rupees now, which means we can buy 30 more so we can get the second last ketchup. Or we could just keep farming to be honest. I don't know, I think we're gonna have to farm for this. Is that a special? Has it got fairy in it? Yep, it was special. See? Ow. Did I do this right? That other one gave me six coins in one go. Drapped. Remember catching chickens give shells on money? Oh no! My biggest enemy. Like, for real, for real though. Is there something here I've yet to do? Or did I already do that? I already did it. Did you check the orange people flowers? Where? I checked up on the guy, but he never did me anything. I'll see how hard these chickens are. Maybe, maybe I can't believe I'm saying this, but maybe it's worthwhile to go run around and look after chickens. What's that, 90? I think that's about 400%. Second last figure, we can do it. Second last. What's it gonna be? Oh, you're back. I am back. And I'm addicted. Probability is one. One. Wait, so am I gonna have a move for 100% guarantee? I don't have enough to put 100 shells in. I am not risking it, sauce, but... Oh my god, I can't even get rid of it! No, I'm sorry, I am not risking all those shells just to get it, just to not get it. Roll them bones, no. You guys have no idea how unlucky I am. Did you not watch the Buckshot Relay Stream? Where I lost on the tutorial twice or something? So we can clip it if it goes wrong. No, I am not that brave. I literally, I lost. We never lose. All gambas quit. Right, I can't believe I'm saying this, but we're gonna give the chicken a try. See if that'll give us the money we're looking for. Hi. Sure, what do you want? These are the ones that are halfway across the map. No, I'm not playing in your stupid chicken game. Fuck you, I'm going to the swamp, where is it? Down. No, oh, no, down. No, I am not, I'm not playing in your chicken games where they're halfway across the map. I'm going to the swamp and there's nothing you can do about it. Swamp to kill this little golden goose thing. Where was it? Was it down here? What is that? Bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam. I'm actually really bad at that, I don't know. Can I go down that pool? What do you want to do? Ow. Oh, well, yeah, you're right, I could have gone to that one, that would have been a lot quicker. But we're here, we're here, it doesn't matter, it doesn't matter. Look, it's about the journey, it's about the experience we made along the way, the experience we made losing our health. Row, wake up. Wake up. Wake up. Prepping slow cooked stew while watching strongly. Good girl, man. Oh, that's what you did. Oh wait, did I go in here? Is this new or am I just making it up? Have I been in you before? I have, because I've already... I can trade, I can trade, please take it, take my stone. It's been so long, four minutes. You're beanstalk as well. We're in the money, boys, we're in the money. Beanstalk as well as Golden's thingy, my Bobber. Oh, and I'm like two centimeters away from it. Oh my god, you're such a good boy, little Minish thing. Hold on, have you got another trade for me? You don't, but that's fine, we're gonna go to the Minish mines. I keep forgetting to go to the Minish mines. Oh my god, we're doing it. We're doing it, I can do it. Shawnee's just gonna try and fill two more, so we're perfect, right? I've not even killed the main boss yet. I've not even done the boss fight. I'm too busy like getting distracted, like doing all these wee side things. I was gonna try and a hundred percent it, but I have no idea what I'm missing, like I'm not smart enough. Clean, clean, clean, clean. I'm climbing, I'm climbing. Oh! You got large quiver! So we can hold 90, oh, 90 bombs, 90 now. Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, I'll take it, I'll take it. Did that thing get away down again? That's fine. Copium telecom is doing. Right, let's go get that sneak, and then we can finally a hundred percent our gacha pawn. I like how the sneak just let me beat them up earlier, and now that's fine. Right, I actually... Oh wait, there's a freaking short cut right here that I walked right past. Cutting the grass. Cut the grass. Can't wait to play grass cut or similiar. I'm actually surprised the power washer doves aren't coming out with some stuff. I'm pretty sure you can't activate them or hurt them from behind. We need to not upset them. I mean, did you get oiled up for the clap audio? Yeah, you can hear me put it on, actually. You can hear me take off the apparel and put on the... Oh, okay, okay, okay. And... Put on... I've taken a while to make the power wash on that. It's a battle of the laser beam! Oh, I love the laser beam. Did I unlock something else here? I have a feeling I unlocked something else here. I didn't. Okay, I love this laser beam. Stay with me all the time. That's what I want to see. That's what I want to see. Right, how much money? Oh, I'm only 150. Is that supposed to do something else? Where does it come from? Maybe... Maybe... something? Should I be giving chat a large cover right now? That was so good. Well, it's getting uploaded first, right then. I think I'll tame it to come on... to go live, like, an hour before AC, because I don't want it to, like... It's not going to disrupt AC's stream, but... I mean, you didn't even want to... I don't want to, like... Obviously... Yeah, I'm trying to pick more words. I don't want to be, like... I don't want to steamroll over my gen mates. Also me, who streams for 12 hours, so it's kind of unavoidable. The last few heart pieces are actually in the dungeon. Oh, okay. Yeah, that was fine. Was that supposed to do something with the orange guy, or am I being trolled? I think I'll just have to go farming in that field. The orange flower guy? Someone mentioned it again, and I'm like, are you trolling me, or is there actually something with that orange flower guy? Did you say he was in town or not? I don't... Someone said... Is it Beel? Him? Why hello there, thanks for coming by. I start playing the theme. No, I think I'm mistaken. Right, this is the Gambo, man. I'm not sure I want a Gambo, to be honest. Beel sells... Who's Beeto? That guy, the guy I just spoke to. The veggie man? Click on the jar. Why hello there, that is the weight for people who want to get lucky. Oh... Okay, that's actually... No, I did not have the money for that, but thank you anyway for asking. Okay, have you played Brit... No, this is my only legend Zolda game. I have not had any Zolda experience other than this game. Right, give me the money for cutting the grass right now. Hand over the money and no one gets hurt. Did I make myself clear video game? Check out all his other ones too. Wind Walker. Wah, he wants to trade. I saw that, I saw that, he wants to trade. I knew you would want to do it. I knew it, I knew it. I knew it, what do you want? Please be a treasure chest, so I can get money for easy peasy land and squeezing. There's one for shells, is there? I don't know where that is. That's super easy to get to. Right, we're heading straight for it. We're making a b-link for it. A perfect match. Thank you, Grandad. I appreciate it. Do you want to do it again? Maybe? No, sorry. Sorry for even asking. Have my money, don't hurt me. Why are you giving me money though? Wait, where the heck am I doing? A little to the left? Thank you again for the tips. Why are you giving me pieces that I can't even do anything with? I can't even do anything with them. The bad guys always drop coins. I feel like the baddies actually drop a decent amount of coins. I'm just making that up. I can't remember what this was. Thank you again, Broly Legends. As I struggle to say your name. I've already... And you don't trade because that would be too easy. Don't forget to pay your taxes. No smile. Just kidding! I pay my taxes. Thank you, Australian Government, for letting me set up businesses in your country. I should have better tax rates than in the UK. I should have gone to Australia. Let me set up a business. Set one up in Australia. This isn't helping either. I'm not making any profit doing that. I think we're just going to have to go grass farming. You know that. I'm trying to make the money and the shales like that. Like in the grass patch. Because I can do a lot of it in one go. I'm sorry. She says that she gets absolutely annihilated. Do these guys drop money? No. I'm sorry. You're just going to have to wait for me. Be patient. Please. Get annihilated. Is the grass patch a buffer below me? Look at the ball. Maybe. Oh, maybe Parasy wants to trade. Parasy might want to trade. At least use the spin attack on the grass. You are so correct. Holy crap. Parasy doesn't care. Sorry, I just picked up you're saying that you just replaced. Spin attack on grass. Spin attack on grass. Spin on the grass. Spin on the grass. Spin on the grass. Spinning on grass. Spinning on grass. I don't know. Oh my god. I completely forgot I could even do this. Holy crap. Are you serious right now? Completely forgot I could even do that. This is going to be a lot faster than what was originally going on. Okay. That's right. Drop me nothing game. Drop me nothing. It's fine. It's not like I wanted anything. Okay. We're getting shells. Hold on a minute. We're getting them soon. Oh we're getting somewhere. We're getting somewhere. Don't write it off yet. Don't write off the tactics yet. Don't write it off yet.

Hmm. Hmm. It seems that forging the sacred blade somehow opened that doorway It must lead to the rooms that holds the secret of the light force link. We have to go inside Oh Oh How interesting look at the images on the stained glass. I bet those pictures show us where the light force is hidden In the principessa it's the opening A long long time ago When the world was on the verge of being swallowed by shadow The tiny picori appeared from the sky bringing the hero of men a sword and a golden light With wisdom and courage the hero drove out the darkness When peace has been restored the people enshrined the blade with care But here it is and the force of the golden light embodied in Hyrule's princess shone forth upon the land So that's what it means Oh As low you really are too kind first you give me my magic cap and then you guide me here You've been far too generous for now. I no longer have any useful. Yeah Batty Yes, that is brish. I don't know What At last I finally know the location of the light force it's the princess Link wake up. Can you wake up? Batty disguised himself as the king to search for the light force When he learned of this place he waited for us to reforge the blade if that stained glass is accurate Princess Zelda holds the light force batty will do whatever it takes to steal that power from her If he succeeds, he may never be able to return the princess to normal We've wasted too much time link. We must stop batty Oh, yeah piss. Oh, yeah piss. We're on the timer. Are we actually though? Or am I being trolled? Why it's golden well, it's all different now, isn't it? All different now Oh What what is this what's happened here? They've been turned to stone all of them the minister and the guard Everyone in the castles like princess Zelda. This can only be the work of that evil batty What cruelty link we must use the power of the sacred foresword to undo this evil Oh Thank you. Thank you. You're the one who returned me to normal, aren't you? I don't know how you did it, but I cannot thank you enough. Listen. Have you seen how strange the king's been lately? That's because it's not the king at all. It's batty. He's taken over the castle One by one. He's turned us all to stone everyone cursed by his evil magic Then the monsters arrived even paralyzed. I saw it all I only pray it's not too late to undo this evil There's so many Link we need your help batty took a petrified princess to the roof of the castello He must be planning something fiendish. You must stop him. I'm going. I'm going. Fuck me. I've only got two fairies in a ball You're in my way, mate Okay, we can get past Thanks, mate.

I was like, this is me This is me working it As if you come flying over to me Okay, I need to fall down as a medium This makes much more sense now I was like there must be a wall I'm missing because I can't interact with anything that seems Okay, I assume the switch is gonna open up the gates Now although that makes no sense, I'm not going to question it at all and instead be thankful Hello Oh Link, are you the one who broke the curse and returned me to normal? You've gone you've gone quite brave since the last time I saw you. I must say Oh, but how those kisses My love is under vice curse Is this all the work of one man as king of hyrule?

You're so brave, but we've lost so much the castle all those people Not any worry about it. No, I try my best any worry about it Ah What's this the curse defeating batty seems to have broken the curse he cast upon me Allow me to introduce myself to you princess Zelda. My name is Ezwo master of minish lore and sorcery The mages cap was my creation, but it's limitless power has caused nothing but trouble for your kind Is there any way that you can forgive me? I know many have fallen and much of the castle has been destroyed But it is too soon to give in to despair The curse on me is broken and Zelda still possesses some of the light force Perhaps together we can do something to make things right Focus focus through that piece on your focus If one sorry if one wears If one with a just heart wears this cap things can be made right again Princess Zelda let your wishes be made real I was gonna say focus focus through the pizza on your princess I wish to restore oh life as it once was Oh no troublemakers on the road I'll have peaceful And always restored in the world Look the castle all the people who had been turned to stone. They're all back to normal The hat it's fallen apart. It's overflowing with the power of life The hat has the power to turn the thoughts of its wearer into reality Vati's heart was filled with evil and that was reflected in what he became But it seems that Zelda's pure heart coupled with the hat's power has created a miracle Oh The portal is closing Hmm. It looks like the time for us to part has come The mini store opens but once every century and soon it must close I must leave you both now and return to my homeland I know I have caused you much suffering But the evil one's power has withered The power of princess Zelda herself has restored the light to Hyrule Well Link my journey with you has been exciting to say the least In fact, I'm more than just a little sad that we most part ways now Please accept this Oh, but it's not as low You know, I've never actually seen you wear in a cap until now. It suits you little hero. Take care Bye Thank you for the advice. Oh god. You're so tiny. Please be careful. I thought Bye buddy Farewell farewell my friend That's crazy small There he is a proud boy link we did it We did it He's Yeah, I don't know how big this team was but Matt hats off to this team The only thing they messed up on was in my opinion Was The ending should remain But I'm gonna show you something if I put up the game again. He's so small. He's five two. Whoa. Is there anyone? And now we only have 40 more games left in the timeline. Wait, there's 40 installments of Zelda. No way That's off. Yeah, okay.

That's like an emo chick But a gen two confirmed Original Zelda staff. Oh, this is a special thank you to the original Management nose take product management Are you shouting at? Oh my god. Link's taking it on the chin as Eslo shouts at him. That's adorable Link, what did you think doing making us jump in that whirlwind?

Why do I have triangle? Yeah, this is the only thing if you complete the game but come back everything is still wrong It's like it's as if you didn't do it Which is such a shame. It means you won. Imagine the game Christianina. Yeah, like I Now don't get me wrong for the explore. I don't I don't even know how I got there For the exploring side of things I completely get leaving the monsters in the game But I don't like it The post game could have Could have been much better in my opinion the post game should be the kingdom is restored And you know make up some plot line where like oh linky need to you know get rid of the stragglers type thing And maybe like kill all the monsters in the world and they perma stay away um It's too dangerous go home. Yeah, like everything's shut down No, that's why we like did all that exploring Um before because like everything gets all changed like the world is now permanently changed. We can't get to like pre this I think Breath of the wind and thingy did that. I could be remembering what wrong Yeah post games elder could be fun, but they've just never done it like don't get me wrong If the development team like it a certain way they like it a certain way. That's fine um But I have to admit for a player that especially is enthralled with a zelda series like this could have been This could have been a lot more fun Um a legend of zelda god that postman did that leap even I can't leap hold on How do you even I can? um, but yeah, there's like The only thing now really is we could just do code stone trading and Kinstone, but You know is what it is Closest you get is a password in the oracle game for the other game that implies you saved the other land first Um But yeah, like it's just such a shame like how it all is as a mayor here Monsters are coming everyone's standers. Oh that doesn't apply to you my boy link go get them You're your sword and braver. You'll save the day Um, yeah, it's such a shame because I think the post game could have been a lot more pretty like especially this in the situation Being all alone is uh, well lonely. I'm going to find myself a nice home too Um There's extra dungeon bosses Hey, wait, wait, wait for me. Um, but yeah, unfortunately, this is where it's like, uh, I really wish they didn't do that And but it's the development team's choice, but for me as a player Hi there, welcome. Sure. I'll take a rest. Um Wait, I'll take the 200 room, please and three girls to come in that'd be great. Thanks. Enjoy your stay Oh wait, we actually just straight up like stayed in a hotel Oh Well, yeah, I think we did it right. We should probably uh redirect into mercy. Hold on a minute We should uh redirect into mercy because uh, there's nothing else I can do Now I can get 100 but I honestly don't know what I'm missing and uh, we'd be at it for quite a while And I'm not really fussed for it because I have kind of corrupted the fail I've not corrupted it, but The fail is now stuck in this like things are blocked off everyone go home dialogue Which isn't that fun whereas like when you start the game everyone's like welcome to town Town love all that jazz But now it's like I'm messed up You know what we'll go home and we'll see grandpa Oh wait, he doesn't know that we've defeated fatty. Oh, no one knows we've defeated fatty. We can't even tell him Oh Oh, well I'm so good. Yeah, it's just the same dialogue. Which is a shame that fail should have been us three girls come with a 400 room I got 400 and but yeah It's slow is on our head again type thing because we haven't done it It's just a complete time loop. Which is such a shame. I I definitely think it could have been A very adorable game if they did it right, I will make sure we're redirecting into mercy Should I pick any kind of support? Oh, she's playing death mark What what's the what's the question she says the title of the stream is do you have the red stuff? What's the red stuff the blue you got the blue? I Right, I'm gonna see if I can put me clapping a some more up I'm probably not gonna do it right now because I think it's a bad time to do it Where is my mercy? See redirecting to mercy But we did it. Thank you so so much for letting me turn a four hour stream into Nine and a half hours. Wow. Holy crap. It took me that long to piss off about How did I do that? Honestly, I freaking I just I'll just stream for a wee bit um tomorrow's streaming experience is Only a few hours of old-school runescape. I'm gonna go hard on the wine because I have my first collab with none other The mercy modis We're gonna play hong kong gifts game And we're gonna see what an earth goes on. Wow. We really endurance that I didn't even mean to like it was just like a little Oopsie. Whoopsie Thank you for showing us the minish cap. Oh, I'm so glad you could enjoy it for the first time if you've never seen it before It's just a cute little pixel game I think it's a very sweet game. Definitely if they had post games, I feel more fun But that's just me. Thank you so so much my little reeflings Um, I'll go talk in mercy stream for a wee bit because I don't know what on earth what kind of game she's playing But might as well watch it wee bit might as well watch it a wee bit um But thank you so so much billet reeflings. I'm so sorry to endurance you again and again night after night day after day I just can't help it. Okay. I need a lot of you And and I'll get a lot of you one way or another. Okay Right. Thank you so so much. I love you Please look after yourself and get a good stretch and a good water and a good sleeping because that was a A longer stream yet. It was a long stream Okay, we will redirect successfully into none other than mercy modis and we will be nice And we will be respectful because remember I'm a fiend for the ink, but you know, you got everyone has their different licks Okay, and mercy now might not be at the same lick as me.
