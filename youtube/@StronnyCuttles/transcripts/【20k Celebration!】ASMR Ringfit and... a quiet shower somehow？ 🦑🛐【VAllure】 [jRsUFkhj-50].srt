1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,500
I'm testing. Wait, I forgot to put something on my head.

2
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:09,500
Test, test, test, test.

3
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:14,500
Hold on.

4
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:25,500
Can you hear me testing? Testing, this is my Google.

5
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:29,500
Are you ready for the ASMR?

6
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,500
Are you?

7
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:35,500
Oh, no, don't make me smile.

8
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:36,500
Oh, I hear myself.

9
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Hold on.

10
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:43,500
Okay, there we go. Hello, can you hear me?

11
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:46,500
Ah, ah, Mike, okay.

12
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:52,500
Okay.

13
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,500
If you just make me jump a bit bigger.

14
00:00:57,500 --> 00:01:00,500
Hold on, let me make you a tiny bit bigger.

15
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:05,500
I need you slightly larger. Hello.

16
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:13,500
It's supposed to be ASMR, but please, let's just all examine this.

17
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:17,500
Oh, sorry, this is a real ASMR, so do not listen to ASMR volumes.

18
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:24,500
Or you will cause yourself, and this thing is called, tonight is, yeah, done.

19
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:28,500
Don't lose yourself to the night.

20
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:30,500
There we go.

21
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:35,500
Yes, that wifling is literally you.

22
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:41,500
Okay, and then we put, I swiped on, and then I think I'm ready to strap in.

23
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:47,500
I just, I don't know what's gonna happen when we get to the shower bar.

24
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:52,500
Because putting the shower on is gonna be something else.

25
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:55,500
It's gonna be so fucking loud.

26
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:58,500
Okay, I'm ready to work out, I don't know.

27
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:02,500
This one's good.

28
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:04,500
It's good to pick it up.

29
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:05,500
Okay.

30
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:08,500
Good morning, good evening, good afternoon.

31
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:10,500
Are we ready?

32
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:12,500
Was that too loud?

33
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:16,500
Tell me if I need to turn up the ASMR, okay?

34
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:23,500
Like, if I need to turn up the microphone, because last night when I was blown out, and then this time, it looks like it's too quiet.

35
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:28,500
The real ASMR, by the way, is cus cus cus cus cus, real ASMR.

36
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:31,500
It's quiet, okay, hold on.

37
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:33,500
Hello.

38
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:37,500
This is a microphone test.

39
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:39,500
I put the sound up a bit.

40
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:44,500
Microphone test, oh my god, it's vibrant.

41
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:52,500
We can, like, do it like this.

42
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:55,500
It's still too quiet, right?

43
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:56,500
Okay, strap.

44
00:02:57,500 --> 00:03:02,500
As you know, I need to use, I love this strap.

45
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:07,500
So, if you want to hear this ASMR sound,

46
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:11,500
this is what's called medical tape,

47
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:18,500
and I'm gonna use this cus cus cus cus cus to attach the band or the joy gone to my leg, okay?

48
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:22,500
Try talking normal, see if it's still quiet.

49
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:23,500
Is it too quiet?

50
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:26,500
I mean, I'm about to start hopping and puffing.

51
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:29,500
Cus cus cus cus.

52
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:34,500
The sister's ASMR.

53
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:39,500
Is it still too quiet?

54
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:40,500
Jeez.

55
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:47,500
I turn up the volume just a little bit more, okay?

56
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:50,500
Cus cus cus cus cus.

57
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:55,500
So the heart rate plus weight is broken right now.

58
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:01,500
We're just gonna have to take the L and C in my heart rate.

59
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:05,500
You're just gonna have to trust with my breathing.

60
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:08,500
I'm actually just a little nervous.

61
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:11,500
Do you want me to mute the game more?

62
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:14,500
Are you okay with the kind of being in the background?

63
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:16,500
It's a bit of a boom.

64
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:20,500
This ASMR, this is real ASMR, by the way.

65
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:25,500
I hope you don't overexert yourself.

66
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:27,500
That's my hidden speciality.

67
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:29,500
I give everything my all.

68
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:32,500
Okay, so on the tie,

69
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:35,500
let's strap it in.

70
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:38,500
That maybe should have done more tape.

71
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:42,500
Oh, I should have done way more tape.

72
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:43,500
Hold on.

73
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:48,500
Okay.

74
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:51,500
Okay.

75
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:56,500
This is gonna fall off so quickly.

76
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:57,500
I'm gonna tell them that.

77
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:59,500
No, not okay.

78
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:00,500
Not okay.

79
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:01,500
I'm not done yet.

80
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:03,500
Slow down.

81
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:04,500
Slow down.

82
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:05,500
Ring fat.

83
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:06,500
I've not even secured it.

84
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:08,500
I've not even secured it.

85
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:11,500
Ring fat.

86
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:13,500
You've been a bit too quick for me.

87
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:15,500
You've been a bit too quick.

88
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:16,500
Ring fat.

89
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:19,500
This game is exciting for me to exercise.

90
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:22,500
I was more excited the game were the right brief ones.

91
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:25,500
But thank you so much for doing this and subscribers.

92
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:27,500
My tracking is gonna get lost.

93
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:29,500
Oh, that's me celebrating that.

94
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:30,500
It's still...

95
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:33,500
I forgot the word.

96
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:35,500
Do you hear those?

97
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:37,500
I'm taking the tape off.

98
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:39,500
At the back of it.

99
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:42,500
I don't know how loud the shower's gonna be.

100
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:44,500
It's gonna be ridiculously loud.

101
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:46,500
Okay, there we go.

102
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:49,500
I am now double strapped up.

103
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:52,500
It is time for the reckoning.

104
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:55,500
Slight the joy-con

105
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:58,500
into the ring for the accessory.

106
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:00,500
Why, yes, of course.

107
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:01,500
I know how to do that.

108
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:03,500
Like this.

109
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:06,500
Sksksks.

110
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:09,500
Oh, yeah.

111
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:10,500
Oh, yeah.

112
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:12,500
Press on the ring.

113
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:13,500
Okay.

114
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:14,500
There's a microphone.

115
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:16,500
Hi, Mr. Microphone.

116
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:17,500
It's right in front of me,

117
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:20,500
so I can get around your ears really easily.

118
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:22,500
But this is...

119
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:23,500
We can stand a little bit.

120
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:26,500
Okay.

121
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:27,500
Oh my god, you can see.

122
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:28,500
It's me.

123
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:31,500
Can you see me wiggling my butt?

124
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:34,500
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle.

125
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:36,500
You see me twerking there?

126
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:37,500
Oh, I don't have my collar on.

127
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:39,500
Hold on.

128
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:40,500
Call her ASMR.

129
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:41,500
Are you ready for this?

130
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:45,500
Do you hear this?

131
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:49,500
Hold on.

132
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:51,500
Is it too loud?

133
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:54,500
Is the collar too loud?

134
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:58,500
Okay.

135
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:03,500
Oh my gosh.

136
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:06,500
A reflin just asked if I was naked.

137
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:07,500
What the fuck?

138
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:09,500
No.

139
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:10,500
I'm not naked.

140
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:11,500
What the fuck?

141
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:13,500
Why would I be naked?

142
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:18,500
I'm wearing an accessory.

143
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:23,500
Okay.

144
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:24,500
I think I was lost.

145
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:26,500
Okay.

146
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:29,500
ASMR, by the way.

147
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:30,500
ASMR.

148
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:31,500
Okay.

149
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:33,500
Move cars there.

150
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:34,500
Up and down.

151
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:35,500
Got it.

152
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:41,500
Adult should be supervised by reflinks.

153
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:45,500
Okay.

154
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:46,500
We'll do quick play again.

155
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:49,500
Because I can't hear any of the in-game audio

156
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:51,500
because my headset doesn't work.

157
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:54,500
We're gonna do all the booty.

158
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:57,500
ASMR.

159
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:00,500
Is there a clue?

160
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:01,500
ASMR.

161
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:02,500
Come on, give us a clue.

162
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:03,500
ASMR.

163
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:04,500
Show us what we know.

164
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:05,500
Lower body, ears.

165
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:06,500
Crashing.

166
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:10,500
Okay.

167
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:11,500
Just as a warning.

168
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:15,500
I'm gonna, the track, it's gonna die

169
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:17,500
like every two seconds, but

170
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:19,500
in exchange you get audio.

171
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:22,500
So, I don't know.

172
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:24,500
There were scoots in the beginning.

173
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:25,500
Did I miss that?

174
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:27,500
Okay, let's go.

175
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:32,500
Start on the floor and bend your knees.

176
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:35,500
Hold the ringcon between your thighs.

177
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:37,500
Squeeze your knees together.

178
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:38,500
Oh, no.

179
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:39,500
Okay.

180
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:41,500
First things first, I'm on the floor

181
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:42,500
with the collar on.

182
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:43,500
Okay.

183
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:45,500
Squeeze it in between your thighs.

184
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:46,500
Bro, my fan is out.

185
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:50,500
Okay, let's go.

186
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:01,500
I can't hear anything.

187
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:07,500
It just launched across the room.

188
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:11,500
It just launched across the room.

189
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:14,500
I didn't have a good enough hold on my thighs.

190
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:21,500
Okay.

191
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:25,500
Did you hear it fly across the room?

192
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:27,500
What is that?

193
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:29,500
You don't need to scream for the exercise.

194
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:30,500
Watch below.

195
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:31,500
Okay.

196
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:33,500
Spread your feet wide.

197
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:35,500
Bend your hips and lean forward.

198
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:38,500
This is very unpar for what I'm wearing.

199
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:39,500
Hold it horizontal.

200
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:43,500
Oh, my chair is in the way.

201
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:45,500
What is that?

202
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:46,500
Am I to squat?

203
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:48,500
Oh, I'm to squat.

204
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:51,500
It's Mars.

205
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:55,500
Fucking hell that thing's vibing.

206
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:57,500
It's Mars.

207
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:00,500
It's Mars.

208
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:03,500
It's Mars.

209
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:07,500
It sounds like something else.

210
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:09,500
I don't even need to think about it.

211
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:11,500
Okay.

212
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:13,500
Okay.

213
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:18,500
Okay, here I come.

214
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:20,500
Stand with your feet.

215
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:21,500
Far.

216
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:22,500
Raise both arms.

217
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:23,500
Okay.

218
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:25,500
What?

219
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:26,500
Excuse me.

220
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:29,500
Oh, I'm not ready for this.

221
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:33,500
Did I get one exam?

222
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:34,500
Oh.

223
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:37,500
Raise more by the way.

224
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:39,500
Oh, I better think of this one.

225
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:40,500
Watch right now.

226
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:42,500
Okay.

227
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:51,500
Dissxxtxtxtxtxt.

228
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:53,500
Okay.

229
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:54,500
Like how my heart is going.

230
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:57,500
Spread your feet and get your toes parallel.

231
00:10:57,500 --> 00:10:58,500
Scalp.

232
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:00,500
Bro, my heart is going.

233
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:03,500
Breathe.

234
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:04,500
From my nose.

235
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:07,500
Okay.

236
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:10,500
I don't breathe through my nose though.

237
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:13,500
eeeeeee

238
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:23,500
okay

239
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:28,500
what the fuck

240
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:30,500
okay, i can tell

241
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:32,500
im actually not too bad at that

242
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:37,500
okay, uff, you know

243
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:42,300
I'm not breathing through my nose, stop telling me to breathe through my nose

244
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:12,500
There's so many tickles, it can feel like I'm going to be back

245
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:14,500
And there's a little further back

246
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:16,500
Ten of us stop and

247
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:18,500
Mother day

248
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:20,500
Band a little more

249
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:23,500
I'm working for it

250
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:26,500
I'm working for a whole straight line of yet

251
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:28,500
Finish

252
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:30,500
Let's go

253
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:33,500
Can't see it, I'm twerking

254
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:39,500
Average score, bing

255
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:40,500
Okay, finish

256
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:43,500
And let me take a sip of water

257
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:46,500
Okay, hydration ASMR

258
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:51,500
Oh my god, when I lean forward the collar presses against my throat

259
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:54,500
It's actually not that comfortable

260
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:56,500
Hydration

261
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:02,500
Why does my throat smell like that?

262
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:05,500
That was so loud

263
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:09,500
I don't want to slurp

264
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:23,500
ASMR, ASMR, ASMR

265
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:26,500
Are you jangling?

266
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:30,500
Do you want to hear that tapping with my cough?

267
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:35,500
Or do you want to hear the tapping of it?

268
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:39,500
That's the joy-con strap

269
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:42,500
I'm raising my legs so you can hear it

270
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:49,500
Are you jangling?

271
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:51,500
You better be

272
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:58,500
No, it's not uncomfortable, actually, forget the collars

273
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:00,500
They're all leaning forward

274
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:04,500
Okay, what's that?

275
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:07,500
What's that? We'll do a glistening ASMR for a second

276
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:10,500
Okay, glistening ASMR

277
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:14,500
You're going to get shower ASMR shortly

278
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:16,500
Please, glitz, focus

279
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:19,500
That's what I'll be waiting for

280
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:25,500
Let's see that slate

281
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:26,500
Here we go

282
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:29,500
Glitz over squalled it

283
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:31,500
Oh, no

284
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:33,500
Okay, what's that?

285
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:34,500
Right there, there we go

286
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:36,500
Okay, let's go

287
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:39,500
This will focus on working your way

288
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:41,500
Good job

289
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:43,500
Amazing

290
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:45,500
Great

291
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:47,500
You're making me cry again

292
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:55,500
I need to turn off the camcorder

293
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:56,500
Yes, right now

294
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:58,500
Amazing

295
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:00,500
Okay, what's that?

296
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:02,500
Game sound?

297
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:06,500
Raise both arms

298
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:11,500
Just keep it in, it's fine, okay

299
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:14,500
Game sound is good

300
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:15,500
Okay, copy cam

301
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:16,500
Oh, no, no

302
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:23,500
ASMR tickles

303
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:24,500
Relaxation

304
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:26,500
Sleep

305
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:27,500
Sleep

306
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:32,500
Oh my god, my eyes just clapped

307
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:35,500
Did you hear that? My eyes just clapped

308
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:39,500
Did you hear that?

309
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:52,500
I don't know why

310
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:55,500
I'm too embarrassed after that

311
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:57,500
I don't know

312
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:04,500
It was hard

313
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:06,500
It's more

314
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:09,500
Sleep, relaxation, de-stress

315
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:13,500
I can't believe it

316
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:17,500
Oh my god

317
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:19,500
Tentacle

318
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:20,500
Tentacle

319
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:22,500
Thank you, Jason

320
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:23,500
Tentacle

321
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:26,500
I'm gonna stop taking screenshots

322
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:30,500
Oh no, not again, this might happen across the room

323
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:33,500
These guys are your knees together

324
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:34,500
I'm trying

325
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:43,500
This is so weird for my people

326
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:46,500
Because I'm so aware that I have a color

327
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:48,500
Okay

328
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:53,500
You're falling asleep

329
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:59,500
And you're enjoying the breathy whisper tangle ASMR

330
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:03,500
And soon you will find yourself relaxed

331
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:05,500
Oh no

332
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:07,500
Oh no

333
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:12,500
Oh no

334
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:14,500
Oh, I know

335
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:18,500
Okay, ready, tingle

336
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:20,500
Okay, we're tingling

337
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:22,500
Okay

338
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:23,500
Okay, copy

339
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:25,500
Runners

340
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:26,500
Okay

341
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:27,500
And you're tingling

342
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:29,500
To the sound of me trying to runners

343
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:31,500
On the floor

344
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:33,500
This is the color of fucking chalks, yeah

345
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:34,500
I'm looking

346
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:35,500
Oh my god, you can

347
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:37,500
Can you hear my ass again?

348
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:40,500
Okay

349
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:41,500
Ready

350
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:48,500
Okay, I'm up

351
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:54,500
Tangle's a lot there, don't know about you

352
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:55,500
I've got an A

353
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:58,500
I don't know how I'm doing so well

354
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:00,500
Okay

355
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:03,500
Do you wanna hear mommy's heartbeat?

356
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:05,500
This is all for you

357
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:14,500
Can you hear it?

358
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:18,500
Hey

359
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:20,500
How are you?

360
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:22,500
How's Johnny?

361
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:26,500
Johnny, why don't you record your heartbeat ASMR?

362
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:28,500
Because that's my resting heart rate, okay?

363
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:30,500
That's what my resting heart rate is

364
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:37,500
Okay, as you should then

365
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:41,500
I'll read all of the things at the end, okay?

366
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:43,500
Thank you

367
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:48,500
My dream

368
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:52,500
Do it my hips way

369
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:55,500
You don't need to see my full model all the time

370
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:05,500
My dream

371
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:09,500
In the middle of a gym

372
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:12,500
An ASMRist approaches you and cleans your ears

373
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:14,500
Tangle, tangle, tangle, tangle

374
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:16,500
Tangle, tangle, tangle, tangle

375
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:18,500
Can you hear me?

376
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:20,500
Tangle, tangle

377
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:24,500
Let me clean those ears of yours

378
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:27,500
Yes, clean, clean, clean

379
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:30,500
But what about your other ears?

380
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:32,500
Is this one dirty too?

381
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:37,500
Your heartbeat sounds like a rave

382
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:40,500
Yeah, you're like

383
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:42,500
You're not clean

384
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:43,500
Tangle

385
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:46,500
Okay

386
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:49,500
Let me do a heartbeat check

387
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:57,500
Okay, let's just check that my heartbeat's gone down a little

388
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:02,500
I think it's gone down

389
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:12,500
Do I need to take a drink that would replace

390
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:15,500
the salt I lose from my sweat?

391
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:17,500
That's why you're here rave-ling

392
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:20,500
You're my after-work out silly

393
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:27,500
Okay, let's go again

394
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:30,500
We'll challenge ourselves

395
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:33,500
We'll do a 10

396
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:35,500
But I'm new

397
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:37,500
D1

398
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:41,500
Do you want to make me sweat rave-ling?

399
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:45,500
Do you want to watch me sweat?

400
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:50,500
Okay

401
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:54,500
We'll do the ear-rolling set

402
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:01,500
Okay, we'll work on this one

403
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:02,500
Okay, let's go

404
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:06,500
Oh shit, I have to focus now

405
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:08,500
Let's just lay down this time real short

406
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:10,500
Okay

407
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:12,500
Okay, I have to do that heartbeat

408
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:14,500
Check, check, check, check

409
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:20,500
Oh, sorry

410
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:23,500
I don't really seem like much

411
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:25,500
I want to do it in front of you

412
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:33,500
4, 5, 6, 7, 6, 7, 8, 9, 9, 10

413
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:35,000

00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:37,000
Hard over there

416
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:37,800

421
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:41,600

422
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:42,460

427
00:21:52,260 --> 00:21:54,300

I feel very exposed in this one

440
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:11,480
I don't have a particular reason

441
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:14,480
you know what I mean, I'm useful

442
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:23,480

I'll prove to you that I'm wearing something, see, you hear that, that's the name, that's my name on my neck

445
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:52,480
I don't know why, I don't know why you think I'm unique

446
00:23:53,480 --> 00:24:01,480
hydration day, honestly it's just really strange, I don't know why

447
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:06,480
that exercise keeps making me calm

448
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:08,480

00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:22,480
you and the bird's eye view of mommy working out, you're so funny

450
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:31,480
I mean, I could put your collar on too

451
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:40,480
I got a collar for you as well, see, this one says refling, R-E-E-F-L-I-N-G

452
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:43,480

453
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:47,480
I'm supposed to be collar

454
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:51,480

455
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:55,480
hold on, I'll put it on you, you're ready

456
00:24:56,480 --> 00:25:01,480
okay, I just need to loop a bit, I suck at this part

457
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:03,480

458
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:06,480

459
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:17,480
okay, your collar's on, you look perfect

460
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:21,480
and you're like extra adorable with your collar on

461
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:24,480
are you ready?

462
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:28,480
any chance for a bail or some jangling?

463
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:30,480
I don't have a bail

464
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:35,480
okay, we go again, we do a new one

465
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:39,480
now that you're in the break of a sweat

466
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:42,480
do you look good in the collar?

467
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:43,480
you look adorable

468
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:44,480
come here, give me a hug

469
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:48,480
you look so precious in that collar

470
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:51,480
I think we look really cute together

471
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:57,480
do you like getting hugs on with me, huh?

472
00:25:58,480 --> 00:25:59,480
yeah, I bet you do

473
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:03,480
okay, you're funny like that refling right now

474
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:08,480
well, you don't want a sweaty hug so much

475
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:13,480
maybe the weird gym girls come up to you and give you ASMRs

476
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:18,480
what else can I do to you?

477
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:20,480
to annoy you at the gym?

478
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:23,480
are you feeling a little too hot?

479
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:26,480
do you need some water?

480
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:31,480
there you go

481
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:33,480
that should kill you then

482
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:39,480
are you feeling all nice and refreshed?

483
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:41,480
hey

484
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:43,480
all refreshed

485
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:45,480
open your mouth

486
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:46,480
I'll hydrate you

487
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:57,480
yeah

488
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:00,480
I'll read all of the ends, I promise, okay?

489
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:02,480
I want it

490
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:05,480
okay, one more little bit of hydration

491
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:14,480
oh no, don't accidentally southern me when I'm trying to bend

492
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:16,480
skks

493
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:18,480
okay

494
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:21,480
now that you're all dangled and ready to go for the next one

495
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:24,480
okay, I don't want abs

496
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:26,480
legs

497
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:27,480
did I do legs?

498
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:29,480
posture

499
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:31,480
when we do legs

500
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:32,480
did I do them?

501
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:35,480
oh, I can't remember

502
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:36,480
did I do legs?

503
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:38,480
stamina

504
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:40,480
for working your stamina?

505
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:43,480
you want me to do posture, okay?

506
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:47,480
I promise I'll get the correct posture for you one day, daddy

507
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:55,480
you guys are a bit archer back

508
00:27:57,480 --> 00:28:00,480
posture, oh my god, what the fuck was that preview?

509
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:03,480
bro, pose the ASMR, what was that?

510
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:04,480
what was that?

511
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:05,480

512
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:06,480

522
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:58,480
hold the ring up behind me

523
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:00,480
skks

524
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:04,480
oh no, I can't do any arm stuff

525
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:11,480
I can't do arm stuff

526
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:12,480
I can't do it

527
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:23,480
I can't do arm stuff at all

528
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:26,480
okay

529
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:28,480

530
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:29,480
okay

531
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:35,480
posture

532
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:37,480
wait, why am I pointing so low? I'm doing it right

533
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:40,480
I'm doing it right

534
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:43,480
and it's GM

535
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:45,480
3, 4 and it's GM

536
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:49,480
it's not right to stare at my point

537
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:51,480
okay

538
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:53,480
oh, okay

539
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:55,480
oh, there we go

540
00:29:58,480 --> 00:29:59,480
what?

541
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:02,480
okay

542
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:04,480
that was 3 here

543
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:06,480
you saw this game?

544
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:09,480
okay, what's this one?

545
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:11,480
don't think it won't work

546
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:13,480
don't think it won't work

547
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:15,480
don't think it won't work

548
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:17,480
don't think it won't work

549
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:19,480
don't think it won't work

550
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:20,480
oh, you can do that one

551
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:22,480
I'm not getting it, please, no more of this one

552
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:25,480
no more of this one

553
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:29,480
every time I look down, it looks so weird

554
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:47,480
this one

555
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:50,480
I wonder how much I can do the splits

556
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:52,480
I can't really show you, you know

557
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:55,480
do you want a watermelon stream?

558
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:58,480
I thought I'd be doing a break in a watermelon

559
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:00,480
with my thigh stream

560
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:02,480
maybe for like

561
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:04,480
35k

562
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:06,480
I was gonna do 25k

563
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:08,480
as the tanker stream

564
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:10,480
and then 30k

565
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:13,480
as the Rebecca Cyberpunk stream

566
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:16,480
so on 35k

567
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:19,480
we could combine our forces

568
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:21,480
and fuck up some fruit

569
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:26,480
that one didn't make my heart sweat as much

570
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:28,480
can you hear that?

571
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:31,480
I don't really feel like it made me

572
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:33,480
work up that much of a sweat

573
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:36,480
should I do a full arm one?

574
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:44,480
oh, you want me to paint a reef one

575
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:46,480
on the marsh and the watermelon?

576
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:49,480
it's actually pretty smart, I might do that

577
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:51,480
that's a really good idea

578
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:55,480
thank you for giving me stream ideas

579
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:57,480
so I don't have to think all the time

580
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:02,480
stamina?

581
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:04,480
well

582
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:06,480
I need more stamina to make sure

583
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:08,480
I keep having fun with you, I don't know

584
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:16,480
start with a tomato

585
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:19,480
do loads of fruit and I'll paint you on all the fruit

586
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:21,480
nooooo

587
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:23,480
I regret my choice already

588
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:27,480
I regret my choice already

589
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:32,480
reefing on my hands and knees where I belong

590
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:51,480
no, not another one please

591
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:53,480
sit on the floor and raise your legs

592
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:55,480
oh no

593
00:32:57,480 --> 00:32:59,480
oh dear

594
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:01,480
there's only this

595
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:03,480
excuse me?

596
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:05,480
oh my god

597
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:07,480
I'm spreading

598
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:09,480
I'm spreading

599
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:11,480
10 more

600
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:13,480
10 more

601
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:15,480
10 more

602
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:17,480
10 more

603
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:19,480
10 more

604
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:24,480
this looks ridiculous

605
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:27,480
I look like a beach whale

606
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:35,480
ok, this is giving me a bit more of a

607
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:37,480
I think

608
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:39,480
ok

609
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:41,480

I fell that one a bit more

637
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:19,480
than the other one

638
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:21,480
the other ones are dead

639
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:31,480

648
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:53,480

649
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:01,480

655
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:25,480
while you're trying to do your personal things

656
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:27,480
not the gym

657
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:29,480
you see I have this new squishy toy

658
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:31,480
that can squish right on your ear

659
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:35,480
make you enjoy the tingle

660
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:39,480
tingle, tingle, tingle

661
00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:45,480

00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:47,480
they actually are doing nothing

663
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:49,480

668
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:03,480
I went to creep on mommy at the gym

669
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:05,480
I would just be on the stair

670
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:07,480

671
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:09,480

00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:11,480
I like those ones

673
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:15,480
I want a big fat booty

674
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:21,480

00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:33,480

678
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:37,480

I'm like that can you put something more

680
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:43,480

681
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:45,480
cause it won't stop

682
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:47,480
well it's a tap in ASMR

683
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:51,480
I'll do a tap in ASMR

684
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:53,480

well I just had to over you

690
00:38:07,480 --> 00:38:09,480
before stream started

691
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:13,480
and I didn't over it since the last time

692
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:15,480
I couldn't ring this since it's been a while

693
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:19,480
I need to clean your ears again a little bit

694
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:21,480

00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:23,480

it's shower time sin

701
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:41,480
I'm sorry that was my bowl

702
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:45,480
okay

703
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:49,480
you don't want to reduce the gains while wearing clothes

704
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:53,480
wait

705
00:38:53,480 --> 00:38:55,480
do you guys have a really good imagination

706
00:38:55,480 --> 00:38:57,480
of how to scrape something to ya

707
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:01,480
check for chafing on the collar

708
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:03,480
I don't feel any

709
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:05,480
it feels nice

710
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:09,480
okay

711
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:11,480
I'm currently wearing a collar

712
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:13,480
and I'm gonna put one knee up on my chair

713
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:17,480
to push it to the side of the room

714
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:19,480
that's all

715
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:27,480
do it that way you will

716
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:33,480
let's see

717
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:35,480
what else

718
00:39:35,480 --> 00:39:37,480
flexibility

719
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:39,480
I need to be flexible

720
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:41,480
wait did we do a flexibility

721
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:43,480
I'm not sure

722
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:45,480
maybe

723
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:51,480
then I can't stand up at work

724
00:39:51,480 --> 00:39:53,480
you're at work listening to this

725
00:39:53,480 --> 00:39:55,480
keep going

726
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:01,480
no go for flexibility

727
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:03,480
flexible

728
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:05,480
ASMR tingles

729
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:07,480
tingle, tingle, tingle

730
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:09,480
tingle, tingle, tingle

731
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:11,480
I'll check everything out

732
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:13,480
the industry

733
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:15,480
oh no

734
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:17,480
does it know

735
00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:19,480
why would it put me in that position

736
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:25,480
does it know

737
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:27,480
I think it knows

738
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:33,480
I hate scaring the one

739
00:40:37,480 --> 00:40:39,480
it's the fact that

740
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:41,480
I'm facing you as well

741
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:43,480
that makes it even

742
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:45,480
louder

743
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:47,480
oh

744
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:49,480
oh no

745
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:51,480
wait

746
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:53,480
we just do bend one way

747
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:55,480
bend your right knee

748
00:40:55,480 --> 00:40:57,480
I know that's what I do when I sit on my chair

749
00:40:59,480 --> 00:41:01,480
I think it knows

750
00:41:01,480 --> 00:41:03,480
okay it's more those

751
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:05,480
go

752
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:07,480
you can go

00:41:49,480 --> 00:41:51,480
I'm getting showered

771
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:53,480
I'm just trying to fucking show

772
00:41:55,480 --> 00:41:57,480
this one isn't that hard

773
00:41:57,480 --> 00:41:59,480
there's no hard exercise

774
00:41:59,480 --> 00:42:01,480
I feel like we need to do a really hard one

775
00:42:01,480 --> 00:42:03,480
put your left foot forward

776
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:05,480
and your right foot behind

777
00:42:05,480 --> 00:42:07,480

778
00:42:07,480 --> 00:42:09,480
forward leg and squat

779
00:42:09,480 --> 00:42:11,480
squatting

780
00:42:11,480 --> 00:42:13,480
I like squatting

781
00:42:13,480 --> 00:42:15,480

782
00:42:15,480 --> 00:42:17,480

783
00:42:17,480 --> 00:42:19,480
oh no this isn't squatting

784
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:23,480
brace through your nose

785
00:42:25,480 --> 00:42:27,480
I can't breathe

786
00:42:27,480 --> 00:42:29,480
okay no we're not doing this one again

787
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:31,480

00:42:35,480 --> 00:42:37,480
I just jumped into the next pose

790
00:42:37,480 --> 00:42:39,480
and I accepted it right away

791
00:42:43,480 --> 00:42:45,480
we'll end it on a really hard one

792
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:47,480
okay and then we'll go first

793
00:42:47,480 --> 00:42:49,480

794
00:42:51,480 --> 00:42:53,480

795
00:42:53,480 --> 00:42:55,480
put your left leg forward and your right back

796
00:42:55,480 --> 00:42:57,480
and put it above my head

797
00:42:57,480 --> 00:42:59,480

803
00:43:19,480 --> 00:43:21,480

804
00:43:21,480 --> 00:43:23,480
I did it in one jump

805
00:43:23,480 --> 00:43:25,480
I'm just asking

806
00:43:37,480 --> 00:43:39,480
this is just called breathing

807
00:43:39,480 --> 00:43:41,480

808
00:43:41,480 --> 00:43:43,480

809
00:43:43,480 --> 00:43:45,480

810
00:43:45,480 --> 00:43:47,480

812
00:43:49,480 --> 00:43:51,480

813
00:43:51,480 --> 00:43:53,480

814
00:43:53,480 --> 00:43:55,480

815
00:43:55,480 --> 00:43:57,480

00:43:57,480 --> 00:43:59,480

I don't get it

826
00:44:21,480 --> 00:44:23,480
I didn't expect that one

827
00:44:25,480 --> 00:44:27,480
that was my score

828
00:44:29,480 --> 00:44:31,480

00:44:35,480 --> 00:44:37,480
I don't really feel too tired

832
00:44:37,480 --> 00:44:39,480
I can only hear my heart we check

833
00:44:39,480 --> 00:44:41,480
you're my heartbeat

834
00:44:41,480 --> 00:44:43,480
I don't really feel that right to be

835
00:44:43,480 --> 00:44:45,480
for Betty and Lesha

836
00:44:45,480 --> 00:44:47,480

837
00:44:47,480 --> 00:44:49,480

839
00:44:51,480 --> 00:44:53,480

00:44:59,480 --> 00:45:01,480

844
00:45:01,480 --> 00:45:03,480

845
00:45:03,480 --> 00:45:05,480

848
00:45:11,480 --> 00:45:13,480

00:47:15,480 --> 00:47:17,480

905
00:47:37,480 --> 00:47:39,480
it is said

906
00:47:39,480 --> 00:47:41,480
for hardcore

907
00:47:41,480 --> 00:47:43,480

908
00:47:43,480 --> 00:47:45,480

I'm fucking

915
00:48:11,480 --> 00:48:13,480
the implication of hardcore

916
00:48:13,480 --> 00:48:15,480
means there's filthy casual

917
00:48:17,480 --> 00:48:19,480

1192
01:00:49,480 --> 01:00:51,480
do not be at too high

1193
01:00:51,480 --> 01:00:53,480
I'm gonna go for a walk

1194
01:00:53,480 --> 01:00:55,480
but very gently so I don't build on my cables

1195
01:00:55,480 --> 01:00:57,480
okay walkies

1196
01:00:57,480 --> 01:00:59,480

1197
01:00:59,480 --> 01:01:01,480
look at the wires

1198
01:01:01,480 --> 01:01:03,480
come on please think about the wires

1199
01:01:07,480 --> 01:01:09,480
those are

1200
01:01:09,480 --> 01:01:11,480
ASMR

1201
01:01:13,480 --> 01:01:15,480

1202
01:01:15,480 --> 01:01:17,480
okay you're now in the bathroom

1203
01:01:17,480 --> 01:01:19,480
I'm gonna put you right here

1204
01:01:19,480 --> 01:01:21,480
can you tell me in the bathroom

1205
01:01:23,480 --> 01:01:25,480
okay I'm just gonna follow the wires

1206
01:01:27,480 --> 01:01:29,480
okay

1207
01:01:29,480 --> 01:01:31,480
the reason

1208
01:01:31,480 --> 01:01:33,480
you can tell in the bathroom's book

1209
01:01:33,480 --> 01:01:35,480
is because this change should also

1210
01:01:35,480 --> 01:01:37,480
look

1211
01:01:37,480 --> 01:01:39,480
this is my towel

1212
01:01:39,480 --> 01:01:41,480
do you hear it

1213
01:01:41,480 --> 01:01:43,480
I'm just gonna very quickly

1214
01:01:43,480 --> 01:01:45,480
go through and check the audio

1215
01:01:45,480 --> 01:01:47,480
so I'm not trying to show everyone

1216
01:01:47,480 --> 01:01:49,480
so just give me a moment

1217
01:01:51,480 --> 01:01:53,480

1218
01:02:11,480 --> 01:02:13,480
so what I'm gonna do

1219
01:02:13,480 --> 01:02:15,480
I don't know if you can even hear me over the water

1220
01:02:15,480 --> 01:02:17,480
what I am

1221
01:02:17,480 --> 01:02:19,480
I'm gonna do is jump in the shower

1222
01:02:19,480 --> 01:02:21,480

1223
01:02:21,480 --> 01:02:23,480
this is too loud

1224
01:02:23,480 --> 01:02:25,480
I don't want you to make it quieter

1225
01:02:29,480 --> 01:02:31,480
I'm trying

1226
01:02:33,480 --> 01:02:35,480
I need to bring the microphone closer

1227
01:02:35,480 --> 01:02:37,480

1228
01:02:37,480 --> 01:02:39,480

1236
01:03:13,480 --> 01:03:15,480

01:07:03,480 --> 01:07:05,480
I'm out of soap, I'm out of everything

1326
01:07:05,480 --> 01:07:07,480
because I'm not being looking after myself

1327
01:07:07,480 --> 01:07:09,480
deodorant yes I'm not

1328
01:07:09,480 --> 01:07:11,480

1329
01:07:11,480 --> 01:07:13,480

1330
01:07:13,480 --> 01:07:15,480
sorry I just cut it in there

1331
01:07:15,480 --> 01:07:17,480
no that's my heart right

1332
01:07:17,480 --> 01:07:19,480
okay that's me

1333
01:07:23,480 --> 01:07:25,480
do not zoom into that

1334
01:07:25,480 --> 01:07:27,480
okay look how do I hide the background

1335
01:07:29,480 --> 01:07:31,480
no that's me

1336
01:07:33,480 --> 01:07:35,480
hi

1337
01:07:35,480 --> 01:07:37,480
you want some ASMR

1338
01:07:37,480 --> 01:07:39,480
we'll pretend to do ASMR

1339
01:07:39,480 --> 01:07:41,480
we'll pretend to do ASMR

1340
01:07:41,480 --> 01:07:43,480
I'm too strong

1341
01:07:43,480 --> 01:07:45,480
imagine if I'll stop

1342
01:07:45,480 --> 01:07:47,480
actually when I close my door I'm surprised

1343
01:07:53,480 --> 01:07:55,480
am I putting

1344
01:07:55,480 --> 01:07:57,480
okay I'm gonna turn out my microphone a little bit

1345
01:07:57,480 --> 01:07:59,480
so don't be startled

1346
01:07:59,480 --> 01:08:01,480
hi Roland

1347
01:08:01,480 --> 01:08:03,480
do you want me to put my collar back on

1348
01:08:03,480 --> 01:08:05,480
do you want another cuddle

1349
01:08:05,480 --> 01:08:07,480
so this is my heart beating now

1350
01:08:07,480 --> 01:08:09,480
okay this is my heart beating

1351
01:08:09,480 --> 01:08:11,480
hold on

1352
01:08:21,480 --> 01:08:23,480
there you go

1353
01:08:23,480 --> 01:08:25,480
so that's my current heartbeat

1354
01:08:25,480 --> 01:08:27,480
okay let me put my

1355
01:08:27,480 --> 01:08:29,480
my collar back on

1356
01:08:29,480 --> 01:08:31,480
I thought I was sweating a lot more on it

1357
01:08:31,480 --> 01:08:33,480
but there's not really anything on it

1358
01:08:33,480 --> 01:08:35,480
that says I was sweating

1359
01:08:35,480 --> 01:08:37,480
I wonder if it was just because

1360
01:08:37,480 --> 01:08:39,480
it was on my neck at a specific point

1361
01:08:43,480 --> 01:08:45,480
why does it sound like it's beating faster

1362
01:08:47,480 --> 01:08:49,480
it might just be my heart

1363
01:08:49,480 --> 01:08:51,480
I do have a heart thingy

1364
01:08:51,480 --> 01:08:53,480
but don't panic

1365
01:08:53,480 --> 01:08:55,480
don't zoom

1366
01:08:55,480 --> 01:08:57,480
my heart's doing things on all directions

1367
01:08:57,480 --> 01:08:59,480
okay

1368
01:08:59,480 --> 01:09:01,480
that's our collar on

1369
01:09:07,480 --> 01:09:09,480
okay I'm neck up my blankie

1370
01:09:09,480 --> 01:09:11,480
I get my ASMR tools

1371
01:09:11,480 --> 01:09:13,480
oh I need to take your collar off

1372
01:09:13,480 --> 01:09:15,480
you still have your collar on

1373
01:09:17,480 --> 01:09:19,480
I don't know if I need to take yours off yet

1374
01:09:21,480 --> 01:09:23,480
cause I don't

1375
01:09:25,480 --> 01:09:27,480
I'm gonna get some ASMR tools

1376
01:09:27,480 --> 01:09:29,480
my tools that I'm wearing

1377
01:09:31,480 --> 01:09:33,480
she's all washed and ready for a treat

1378
01:09:33,480 --> 01:09:35,480
no you wanna leave that one

1379
01:09:35,480 --> 01:09:37,480
okay we both collared

1380
01:09:37,480 --> 01:09:39,480
okay I'm gonna pretend to do ASMR now

1381
01:09:43,480 --> 01:09:45,480
let me make sure I redirected this to you

1382
01:09:45,480 --> 01:09:47,480
later

1383
01:09:47,480 --> 01:09:49,480
cause I'll forget if I don't do it now

1384
01:09:49,480 --> 01:09:51,480
okay I'm gonna do a little role play

1385
01:09:53,480 --> 01:09:55,480
but I hope you enjoyed being at the gym with me

1386
01:09:55,480 --> 01:09:57,480
even though that was a very very

1387
01:09:57,480 --> 01:09:59,480
excessive gym

1388
01:10:01,480 --> 01:10:03,480
that gym was very difficult

1389
01:10:03,480 --> 01:10:05,480
okay I'm sorry about all the mouse clicking

1390
01:10:07,480 --> 01:10:09,480
a shock collar

1391
01:10:09,480 --> 01:10:11,480
no I'm not wearing my shock collar today

1392
01:10:11,480 --> 01:10:13,480
I'm wearing my collar

1393
01:10:13,480 --> 01:10:15,480
that I got for being a good pup

1394
01:10:17,480 --> 01:10:19,480
and I also got your collar as well

1395
01:10:19,480 --> 01:10:21,480
so

1396
01:10:25,480 --> 01:10:27,480
those claps were great bro

1397
01:10:27,480 --> 01:10:29,480
they were so embarrassing

1398
01:10:29,480 --> 01:10:31,480
my pup wouldn't stop

1399
01:10:31,480 --> 01:10:33,480
okay

1400
01:10:37,480 --> 01:10:39,480
oh is she being on speaker?

1401
01:10:39,480 --> 01:10:41,480
don't lay out

1402
01:10:43,480 --> 01:10:45,480
this collar is much more fun

1403
01:10:45,480 --> 01:10:47,480
yeah I'm a bit biased

1404
01:10:49,480 --> 01:10:51,480
okay clean your ears

1405
01:10:53,480 --> 01:10:55,480
so how long have you been going to the gym for?

1406
01:10:57,480 --> 01:10:59,480
don't worry I just started as well

1407
01:10:59,480 --> 01:11:01,480
I'm somewhat of a novice

1408
01:11:01,480 --> 01:11:03,480
but I'm sure you can teach me a few things

1409
01:11:15,480 --> 01:11:17,480
you see

1410
01:11:17,480 --> 01:11:19,480
oh it's been struggling

1411
01:11:21,480 --> 01:11:23,480
what are you gonna do with the fog?

1412
01:11:23,480 --> 01:11:25,480
leave it up, I'm doing exercise

1413
01:11:25,480 --> 01:11:27,480
you're allowed to breathe while exercising

1414
01:11:29,480 --> 01:11:31,480
that's why we're doing ring fit

1415
01:11:31,480 --> 01:11:33,480
naturally

1416
01:11:33,480 --> 01:11:35,480
just for poseable tonight

1417
01:11:41,480 --> 01:11:43,480
I need to work on my

1418
01:11:43,480 --> 01:11:45,480
flex ability

1419
01:11:45,480 --> 01:11:47,480
to struggle

1420
01:11:47,480 --> 01:11:49,480
with my back

1421
01:11:49,480 --> 01:11:51,480
flex ability

1422
01:11:51,480 --> 01:11:53,480
it's rather difficult

1423
01:11:53,480 --> 01:11:55,480
for me to arch it

1424
01:11:55,480 --> 01:11:57,480
so you know

1425
01:11:59,480 --> 01:12:01,480
you should definitely

1426
01:12:01,480 --> 01:12:03,480
help me

1427
01:12:03,480 --> 01:12:05,480
to work out

1428
01:12:09,480 --> 01:12:11,480
oh then you're true to go to your games

1429
01:12:15,480 --> 01:12:17,480
average game in session

1430
01:12:17,480 --> 01:12:19,480
where the pros think they're cool

1431
01:12:19,480 --> 01:12:21,480
hold on let me just

1432
01:12:21,480 --> 01:12:23,480
move my level

1433
01:12:23,480 --> 01:12:25,480
my calibration

1434
01:12:25,480 --> 01:12:27,480
do my calibration

1435
01:12:27,480 --> 01:12:29,480
alright

1436
01:12:29,480 --> 01:12:31,480
I agree to it

1437
01:12:31,480 --> 01:12:33,480
my calibration is more

1438
01:12:33,480 --> 01:12:35,480
okay there we go

1439
01:12:35,480 --> 01:12:37,480
it sees me a lot better

1440
01:12:37,480 --> 01:12:39,480
I don't know where to put this off

1441
01:12:39,480 --> 01:12:41,480
I can hear it the best way

1442
01:12:41,480 --> 01:12:43,480
all your games

1443
01:12:47,480 --> 01:12:49,480
bro that one move

1444
01:12:49,480 --> 01:12:51,480
it can give me the same move

1445
01:12:51,480 --> 01:12:53,480
over and over

1446
01:12:53,480 --> 01:12:55,480
you clapped about 40 times during the work

1447
01:12:55,480 --> 01:12:57,480
did I actually?

1448
01:12:57,480 --> 01:12:59,480
so I could hear it

1449
01:12:59,480 --> 01:13:01,480
when it was really loud

1450
01:13:01,480 --> 01:13:03,480
but I stayed up all night just to watch the stream

1451
01:13:03,480 --> 01:13:05,480
I'm so sorry for you some schedule

1452
01:13:07,480 --> 01:13:09,480
you clapped a wall

1453
01:13:09,480 --> 01:13:11,480
I don't know

1454
01:13:11,480 --> 01:13:13,480
I thought it was like once or twice

1455
01:13:13,480 --> 01:13:15,480
during that one

1456
01:13:15,480 --> 01:13:17,480
exercise

1457
01:13:17,480 --> 01:13:19,480
in particular

1458
01:13:19,480 --> 01:13:21,480
just with the song

1459
01:13:21,480 --> 01:13:23,480
thank you

1460
01:13:27,480 --> 01:13:29,480
day and night

1461
01:13:29,480 --> 01:13:31,480
we're going back

1462
01:13:31,480 --> 01:13:33,480
we're working out hard

1463
01:13:33,480 --> 01:13:35,480
so only

1464
01:13:35,480 --> 01:13:37,480
the only thing to remedy

1465
01:13:37,480 --> 01:13:39,480
is being a long, hard worker

1466
01:13:39,480 --> 01:13:41,480
is ear cupping

1467
01:13:41,480 --> 01:13:43,480
thank you

1468
01:13:43,480 --> 01:13:45,480
and our

1469
01:13:45,480 --> 01:13:47,480
dark work coming in

1470
01:13:47,480 --> 01:13:49,480
the runners are better

1471
01:13:49,480 --> 01:13:51,480
claim are such a cool

1472
01:13:53,480 --> 01:13:55,480
the reef link thing in the rake oil

1473
01:13:57,480 --> 01:13:59,480
we gave ourselves a stand

1474
01:13:59,480 --> 01:14:01,480
I mean I could still do it right now

1475
01:14:01,480 --> 01:14:03,480
when I've been

1476
01:14:03,480 --> 01:14:05,480
when I've been about puppy

1477
01:14:05,480 --> 01:14:07,480
you have to put me in the corner

1478
01:14:07,480 --> 01:14:09,480
and tell me to clap

1479
01:14:09,480 --> 01:14:11,480
the egg

1480
01:14:11,480 --> 01:14:13,480
clamors and the echo

1481
01:14:13,480 --> 01:14:15,480
don't sure I should have been renamed to random

1482
01:14:15,480 --> 01:14:17,480
the laughter of the clap

1483
01:14:17,480 --> 01:14:19,480
the bearer of this love

1484
01:14:19,480 --> 01:14:21,480
I've done cataclysmic clothing

1485
01:14:25,480 --> 01:14:27,480
basically oh you've been a bad puppy

1486
01:14:27,480 --> 01:14:29,480
go into the corner of the room

1487
01:14:29,480 --> 01:14:31,480
and think about it

1488
01:14:31,480 --> 01:14:33,480
think about what you've done

1489
01:14:33,480 --> 01:14:35,480
I mean wait

1490
01:14:35,480 --> 01:14:37,480
can I do something really silly

1491
01:14:37,480 --> 01:14:39,480
can I go into the kitchen and clap

1492
01:14:39,480 --> 01:14:41,480
and see if you can hear

1493
01:14:41,480 --> 01:14:43,480
I like the free edge

1494
01:14:45,480 --> 01:14:47,480
okay right

1495
01:14:47,480 --> 01:14:49,480
just this is a test

1496
01:14:49,480 --> 01:14:51,480
okay this is just a test

1497
01:14:51,480 --> 01:14:53,480
I'm gonna go into the kitchen

1498
01:14:53,480 --> 01:14:55,480
and see if you can hear this

1499
01:14:55,480 --> 01:14:57,480
when I'm up

1500
01:15:03,480 --> 01:15:05,480
did you hear that

1501
01:15:05,480 --> 01:15:07,480
did you

1502
01:15:07,480 --> 01:15:09,480
did you

1503
01:15:09,480 --> 01:15:11,480
did you

1504
01:15:11,480 --> 01:15:13,480
okay

1505
01:15:17,480 --> 01:15:19,480
it was weird

1506
01:15:19,480 --> 01:15:21,480
it's like thunder

1507
01:15:25,480 --> 01:15:27,480
it was me in my kitchen

1508
01:15:27,480 --> 01:15:29,480
like a cookie

1509
01:15:29,480 --> 01:15:31,480
okay

1510
01:15:31,480 --> 01:15:33,480
yeah

1511
01:15:37,480 --> 01:15:39,480
clap clap clap

1512
01:15:39,480 --> 01:15:41,480
exercise

1513
01:15:41,480 --> 01:15:43,480
no no do it again

1514
01:15:43,480 --> 01:15:45,480
sit on the mic

1515
01:15:45,480 --> 01:15:47,480
I can I'm gonna break it

1516
01:15:47,480 --> 01:15:49,480
this is my expensive mic

1517
01:15:49,480 --> 01:15:51,480
so if you didn't know

1518
01:15:51,480 --> 01:15:53,480
3DO the brand of microphone

1519
01:15:53,480 --> 01:15:55,480
or mostly known for ASMR

1520
01:15:55,480 --> 01:15:57,480
they released a microphone

1521
01:15:57,480 --> 01:15:59,480
they released a black one

1522
01:15:59,480 --> 01:16:01,480
and a white one

1523
01:16:01,480 --> 01:16:03,480
and the white one is 500

1524
01:16:03,480 --> 01:16:05,480
and the black one is 2000

1525
01:16:05,480 --> 01:16:07,480
and I was like oh I want to

1526
01:16:07,480 --> 01:16:09,480
on my ASMR game

1527
01:16:09,480 --> 01:16:11,480
I'm gonna buy the black one

1528
01:16:11,480 --> 01:16:13,480
and it like sounds no different

1529
01:16:13,480 --> 01:16:15,480
and I used the black one

1530
01:16:15,480 --> 01:16:17,480
for my role plays

1531
01:16:17,480 --> 01:16:19,480
but I have to use it right now

1532
01:16:19,480 --> 01:16:21,480
for when I do ASMR

1533
01:16:21,480 --> 01:16:23,480
and shower

1534
01:16:23,480 --> 01:16:25,480
or bath night stuff

1535
01:16:25,480 --> 01:16:27,480
and there is like

1536
01:16:27,480 --> 01:16:29,480
like

1537
01:16:29,480 --> 01:16:31,480
everyone in chat

1538
01:16:31,480 --> 01:16:33,480
going feral, good

1539
01:16:33,480 --> 01:16:35,480
I like it that way

1540
01:16:35,480 --> 01:16:37,480
we can be feral for each other

1541
01:16:37,480 --> 01:16:39,480
but on ASMR too

1542
01:16:39,480 --> 01:16:41,480
I've got a fluffy

1543
01:16:41,480 --> 01:16:43,480
you can hear the fluffy

1544
01:16:43,480 --> 01:16:45,480
over your ear

1545
01:16:45,480 --> 01:16:47,480
it sounds like a perverable

1546
01:16:47,480 --> 01:16:49,480
well people were asking

1547
01:16:49,480 --> 01:16:51,480
would I ever give a KU

1548
01:16:51,480 --> 01:16:53,480
microphone

1549
01:16:53,480 --> 01:16:55,480
now I would love to

1550
01:16:55,480 --> 01:16:57,480
but I don't think I even

1551
01:16:57,480 --> 01:16:59,480
have the capabilities

1552
01:16:59,480 --> 01:17:01,480
to utilize it properly

1553
01:17:01,480 --> 01:17:03,480
like if I was up in my game

1554
01:17:03,480 --> 01:17:05,480
to a KU

1555
01:17:05,480 --> 01:17:07,480
I would like want a proper

1556
01:17:07,480 --> 01:17:09,480
dedicated like soundproofed room

1557
01:17:09,480 --> 01:17:11,480
obviously I rent

1558
01:17:11,480 --> 01:17:13,480
so I can't do anything like that

1559
01:17:13,480 --> 01:17:15,480
but like I don't know

1560
01:17:15,480 --> 01:17:17,480
if you know Nene from Kauai

1561
01:17:17,480 --> 01:17:19,480
she has like

1562
01:17:19,480 --> 01:17:21,480
insane ASMR

1563
01:17:21,480 --> 01:17:23,480
it sounds amazing through that microphone

1564
01:17:23,480 --> 01:17:25,480
but I just know if I go

1565
01:17:25,480 --> 01:17:27,480
that microphone and sound my balls

1566
01:17:27,480 --> 01:17:29,480
and open it when the sound is good

1567
01:17:29,480 --> 01:17:31,480
yeah you want this and she can

1568
01:17:31,480 --> 01:17:33,480
yeah but since 360 degree

1569
01:17:33,480 --> 01:17:35,480
honestly

1570
01:17:35,480 --> 01:17:37,480
you go for the 2 and the 1

1571
01:17:37,480 --> 01:17:39,480
oh no I would never ask for that

1572
01:17:41,480 --> 01:17:43,480
I would never ask for that

1573
01:17:43,480 --> 01:17:45,480
that's like

1574
01:17:45,480 --> 01:17:47,480
I'd rather put that money towards

1575
01:17:47,480 --> 01:17:49,480
giving other features

1576
01:17:49,480 --> 01:17:51,480
a chance of VLR

1577
01:17:51,480 --> 01:17:53,480
put that money towards them

1578
01:17:53,480 --> 01:17:55,480
or like

1579
01:17:55,480 --> 01:17:57,480
get more success for Gen 1

1580
01:17:57,480 --> 01:17:59,480
in the game like there's a project

1581
01:17:59,480 --> 01:18:01,480
that's going on for Gen 1

1582
01:18:01,480 --> 01:18:03,480
that's coming out soon to you

1583
01:18:03,480 --> 01:18:05,480
as I always say soon to you

1584
01:18:05,480 --> 01:18:07,480
I would rather put

1585
01:18:07,480 --> 01:18:09,480
my money into them

1586
01:18:09,480 --> 01:18:11,480
hopefully the 3DO

1587
01:18:11,480 --> 01:18:13,480
is good now

1588
01:18:13,480 --> 01:18:15,480
almost just creepy

1589
01:18:15,480 --> 01:18:17,480
you're not creepy

1590
01:18:17,480 --> 01:18:19,480
aren't they like

1591
01:18:19,480 --> 01:18:21,480
10,000 USD

1592
01:18:21,480 --> 01:18:23,480
with that much money

1593
01:18:23,480 --> 01:18:25,480
I could probably get

1594
01:18:25,480 --> 01:18:27,480
2 models

1595
01:18:27,480 --> 01:18:29,480
and then that's 2 new girls

1596
01:18:29,480 --> 01:18:31,480
that get the opportunity

1597
01:18:31,480 --> 01:18:33,480
to be a feature

1598
01:18:33,480 --> 01:18:35,480
more of their dreams

1599
01:18:35,480 --> 01:18:37,480
like as I said I kind of

1600
01:18:37,480 --> 01:18:39,480
Gen 1 off collab

1601
01:18:39,480 --> 01:18:41,480
I've spoken about it a little bit

1602
01:18:43,480 --> 01:18:45,480
I think the key is overrated

1603
01:18:45,480 --> 01:18:47,480
I don't know where the 3DO

1604
01:18:47,480 --> 01:18:49,480
can sell me

1605
01:18:49,480 --> 01:18:51,480
and the Everglot in it can sell

1606
01:18:51,480 --> 01:18:53,480
but that's different

1607
01:18:53,480 --> 01:18:55,480
I'd be smacking my feet all over

1608
01:18:55,480 --> 01:18:57,480
that microphone ability

1609
01:18:57,480 --> 01:18:59,480
you can hear me literally step on your face

1610
01:18:59,480 --> 01:19:01,480
ASMR

1611
01:19:01,480 --> 01:19:03,480
I would make with that key

1612
01:19:03,480 --> 01:19:05,480
it would be insane

1613
01:19:05,480 --> 01:19:07,480
you can rent a girlfriend

1614
01:19:07,480 --> 01:19:09,480
with that money

1615
01:19:09,480 --> 01:19:11,480
I thought the coin ring

1616
01:19:11,480 --> 01:19:13,480
was like 50 quid

1617
01:19:13,480 --> 01:19:15,480
to hire someone for the name

1618
01:19:15,480 --> 01:19:17,480
I don't know

1619
01:19:21,480 --> 01:19:23,480
but yeah

1620
01:19:23,480 --> 01:19:25,480
I feel like I'd rather

1621
01:19:25,480 --> 01:19:27,480
work on

1622
01:19:27,480 --> 01:19:29,480
than give an opportunity

1623
01:19:29,480 --> 01:19:31,480
to a girl

1624
01:19:31,480 --> 01:19:33,480
to be the feature of their dreams

1625
01:19:33,480 --> 01:19:35,480
I mean to be their dreams

1626
01:19:35,480 --> 01:19:37,480
because obviously they get assigned a character

1627
01:19:37,480 --> 01:19:39,480
whatever

1628
01:19:39,480 --> 01:19:41,480
but in promotional money and stuff

1629
01:19:45,480 --> 01:19:47,480
I'm tickling your ears

1630
01:19:47,480 --> 01:19:49,480
can you hear the brush

1631
01:19:49,480 --> 01:19:51,480
in your ears

1632
01:19:51,480 --> 01:19:53,480
all the nitty

1633
01:19:53,480 --> 01:19:55,480
bit you there

1634
01:19:55,480 --> 01:19:57,480
okay it looks like I'm looking at you

1635
01:19:57,480 --> 01:19:59,480
I think it's wonderful

1636
01:19:59,480 --> 01:20:01,480
you are the feature of my dreams

1637
01:20:03,480 --> 01:20:05,480
I mean

1638
01:20:05,480 --> 01:20:07,480
I am allowed to be a little bit selfish

1639
01:20:07,480 --> 01:20:09,480
I feel like

1640
01:20:09,480 --> 01:20:11,480
if I wanted to get you

1641
01:20:11,480 --> 01:20:13,480
I would have been fistin' it myself

1642
01:20:13,480 --> 01:20:15,480
I wouldn't ask for that kind of money

1643
01:20:15,480 --> 01:20:17,480
for myself

1644
01:20:17,480 --> 01:20:19,480
that's too much

1645
01:20:19,480 --> 01:20:21,480
maybe

1646
01:20:21,480 --> 01:20:23,480
for my one year anniversary

1647
01:20:27,480 --> 01:20:29,480
yeah

1648
01:20:29,480 --> 01:20:31,480
that sounds like something we could try

1649
01:20:31,480 --> 01:20:33,480
for my one year anniversary

1650
01:20:33,480 --> 01:20:35,480
I'll spoil us

1651
01:20:35,480 --> 01:20:37,480
and I'll buy myself a KU

1652
01:20:37,480 --> 01:20:39,480
and then I can put my feet

1653
01:20:39,480 --> 01:20:41,480
on it on your face

1654
01:20:41,480 --> 01:20:43,480
but

1655
01:20:43,480 --> 01:20:45,480
but

1656
01:20:45,480 --> 01:20:47,480
you think I'm joking

1657
01:20:47,480 --> 01:20:49,480
and I'm actually gonna do it

1658
01:20:49,480 --> 01:20:51,480
I'm gonna be a little selfish

1659
01:20:51,480 --> 01:20:53,480
you need to be a little more selfish

1660
01:20:55,480 --> 01:20:57,480
sitting on your face

1661
01:20:57,480 --> 01:20:59,480
I can do that too

1662
01:20:59,480 --> 01:21:01,480
I'll be very gently sitting on that microphone

1663
01:21:01,480 --> 01:21:03,480
just let me be clear

1664
01:21:03,480 --> 01:21:05,480
I've already done sitting on you

1665
01:21:05,480 --> 01:21:07,480
on the 3DO microphone

1666
01:21:07,480 --> 01:21:09,480
I'm just waiting for a warning to get off my channel

1667
01:21:09,480 --> 01:21:11,480
I'm not gonna be a little real

1668
01:21:11,480 --> 01:21:13,480
I'm not gonna be a little real

1669
01:21:13,480 --> 01:21:15,480
I'm not gonna be a little real

1670
01:21:15,480 --> 01:21:17,480
I thought of an extra about any

1671
01:21:17,480 --> 01:21:19,480
two more expense

1672
01:21:19,480 --> 01:21:21,480
smaller than the quality

1673
01:21:21,480 --> 01:21:23,480
between the next four

1674
01:21:23,480 --> 01:21:25,480
and any lively jail or small

1675
01:21:25,480 --> 01:21:27,480
hundred

1676
01:21:27,480 --> 01:21:29,480
called the chance to play on a 5,020

1677
01:21:29,480 --> 01:21:31,480
difference this was small

1678
01:21:31,480 --> 01:21:33,480
my friends couldn't know

1679
01:21:33,480 --> 01:21:35,480
I will say no

1680
01:21:35,480 --> 01:21:37,480
or to play

1681
01:21:37,480 --> 01:21:39,480
3DO is more 3DO

1682
01:21:39,480 --> 01:21:41,480
is more peak difference

1683
01:21:41,480 --> 01:21:43,480
peak

1684
01:21:43,480 --> 01:21:45,480
we need to buy mommy a sacrificial microphone

1685
01:21:45,480 --> 01:21:47,480
to destroy oh no no

1686
01:21:47,480 --> 01:21:49,480
that's already on the way

1687
01:21:49,480 --> 01:21:51,480
you see I'm

1688
01:21:51,480 --> 01:21:53,480
diabolical enough

1689
01:21:53,480 --> 01:21:55,480
that I ordered a microphone

1690
01:21:55,480 --> 01:21:57,480
that's going spelunking

1691
01:21:57,480 --> 01:21:59,480
well I ordered two

1692
01:21:59,480 --> 01:22:01,480
I ordered one microphone to go spelunking

1693
01:22:01,480 --> 01:22:03,480
and then I ordered a different

1694
01:22:03,480 --> 01:22:05,480
like the same kind of microphone

1695
01:22:05,480 --> 01:22:07,480
whilst

1696
01:22:07,480 --> 01:22:09,480
that one goes

1697
01:22:09,480 --> 01:22:11,480
slimy I guess

1698
01:22:11,480 --> 01:22:13,480
I'm gonna go for the slime

1699
01:22:13,480 --> 01:22:15,480

1716
01:23:01,480 --> 01:23:03,480

thank you

1718
01:23:05,480 --> 01:23:07,480
surely that's what you're saying

1719
01:23:07,480 --> 01:23:09,480
but yes

1720
01:23:09,480 --> 01:23:11,480
you will be eating very good

1721
01:23:11,480 --> 01:23:13,480
as I say my favorite phrase

1722
01:23:13,480 --> 01:23:15,480
is slimy cake because it takes time

1723
01:23:15,480 --> 01:23:17,480
for this periphery

1724
01:23:17,480 --> 01:23:19,480
for this periphery

1725
01:23:19,480 --> 01:23:21,480
some of those

1726
01:23:21,480 --> 01:23:23,480
poses were wild

1727
01:23:23,480 --> 01:23:25,480
brah when I looked down

1728
01:23:25,480 --> 01:23:27,480
I was like I'm literally

1729
01:23:27,480 --> 01:23:29,480
glistening down there

1730
01:23:29,480 --> 01:23:31,480
I was like what is these poses

1731
01:23:31,480 --> 01:23:33,480
does that make your pizza

1732
01:23:33,480 --> 01:23:35,480
that's easy

1733
01:23:39,480 --> 01:23:41,480
glistening here with sweat

1734
01:23:41,480 --> 01:23:43,480
I had sweat on me like

1735
01:23:43,480 --> 01:23:45,480
pizza of sweat

1736
01:23:47,480 --> 01:23:49,480
that was like I went down

1737
01:23:49,480 --> 01:23:51,480
brightness A is my version too

1738
01:23:51,480 --> 01:23:53,480
I wonder what it would sound like

1739
01:23:53,480 --> 01:23:55,480
maybe I should call it that

1740
01:23:55,480 --> 01:23:57,480
like brightness A is more

1741
01:23:57,480 --> 01:23:59,480
but I'm trying to hope because this is where

1742
01:23:59,480 --> 01:24:01,480
you would be in theory

1743
01:24:05,480 --> 01:24:07,480
sweat jar sales

1744
01:24:07,480 --> 01:24:09,480

1745
01:24:09,480 --> 01:24:11,480

1746
01:24:11,480 --> 01:24:13,480

1748
01:24:15,480 --> 01:24:17,480
but you're approaching

1749
01:24:17,480 --> 01:24:19,480
to hear the

1750
01:24:19,480 --> 01:24:21,480
crunching of the ball

1751
01:24:21,480 --> 01:24:23,480
I always say it sounds like thunder

1752
01:24:23,480 --> 01:24:25,480

1753
01:24:25,480 --> 01:24:27,480

01:24:39,480 --> 01:24:41,480

1760
01:24:41,480 --> 01:24:43,480
that painting over with that spine

1761
01:24:43,480 --> 01:24:45,480
that came out of nowhere

1762
01:24:45,480 --> 01:24:47,480
I was like excuse me

1763
01:24:47,480 --> 01:24:49,480

01:29:01,480 --> 01:29:03,480
I get questions like that

1834
01:29:03,480 --> 01:29:05,480

01:29:05,480 --> 01:29:07,480
