0	4380	Hey?
4380	10700	I'm a dreamer even though we're a kitty cat.
10700	12480	Cat, I'm a kitty cat.
12480	17400	Cat, I'm a kitty cat.
17400	18400	And I meow, meow, meow.
18400	19500	And I meow, meow, meow.
19500	22180	Cat, I'm a kitty cat, and I dance, dance, dance.
22180	23580	And I dance, dance, dance.
23580	26320	Cat, I'm a kitty cat.
26320	27620	Cat, I'm a kitty cat.
27620	32620	You guys remember that hit viral YouTube video where the song goes
32620	34620	I'm a cat, me and I'm a kitty cat
34620	37120	And I dance and dance and dance and dance and dance
37120	39120	Yeah, well I remember anyway
40620	44120	I don't know if it might be better for me to play games like in the middle of the screen
44120	48120	I feel like I'll always cover up something important over here
49120	52620	But then I end up getting really tiny, but then if I'm here, it's like well
52620	54620	At least I can show my face
55620	59620	I can't feel my face when I'm open
59620	60620	Heart or heart?
60620	62620	Okay, let me explain the hearts
62620	65620	I did a bit of, did a bit of work, yeah
65620	66620	Did a bit of work
66620	68620	So you may notice
68620	69620	Good morning
69620	72620	Good evening
72620	74620	Or good afternoon
74620	76620	I'm your host
76620	78620	Strony Cuttos
79620	84620	Let's get right into the updates
84620	87620	Which is hardly any, there's not that much interesting stuff
87620	92620	If you are a member of any viewer member, you may notice that there's hearts
92620	93620	What do the hearts mean?
93620	97620	The hearts are placeholders for where emotes are going to go
97620	102620	YouTube is slightly, slightly
102620	105620	A little bit, dare I say, a bit based
105620	111620	You cannot lose an emotes slot if you bagzian, okay
111620	116620	I'm gonna hope that bagzian is a terminology
117620	121620	Used by anyone else outside of Scotland
121620	124620	But bagzian means it is reserved, if you will
124620	126620	My new favourite emotes just dropped, okay
127620	130620	Can we keep one heart or moe?
131620	136620	Although I think me holding the heart and moe is better than just an emote
136620	139620	Bro, I can't even fucking png them
139620	144620	But anyway, if you are a member of any girls channel, you will notice that there's moe slots
144620	148620	And depending on how many hearts you see is how many slots unlocked
148620	152620	AC for example is the first girl to receive her batch
152620	154620	So hers is already up
154620	157620	Emmys is the next to receive her batch
157620	159620	There was a bit of a miscommunication error
159620	164620	And by miscommunication error, they just randomly didn't draw one of the emotes we requested
164620	169620	And drew one of the emotes we already, like redrew one of the emotes we already had
169620	171620	And they were like, here's your delivery
171620	177620	And I was like, no, no, no, no, that's not what my little sister wanted
177620	180620	And that has to be, I'm glad she caught it actually
180620	183620	I sent it to Emmys and I was like, how does it look?
183620	184620	Are you happy with it?
184620	189620	And she's like, strongy, there's an entire emote missing
189620	193620	And one we didn't ask for, and I'm like, you know what Emmys?
193620	199620	Even though you have negative 5 prescription, you've got some bloody good eyes on you sometimes for spotting
199620	202620	Eh, oh did you hear my caller?
202620	207620	Hi, hi, hello, hello
207620	209620	I can't go anywhere
209620	214620	Um, updates
214620	218620	There's a new AC short, there's a new short on my channel
218620	220620	There's a new short on Mercy's channel
220620	225620	Um, Azura's got 4 shorts that have been ordered
225620	229620	One of them is absolutely outrageous and hilarious
229620	235620	Um, I had to get a serial box commissioned for it
235620	237620	It was that funny
237620	240620	Um, so hopefully when that comes out, I'll send Azura's way
240620	245620	Cause Purser and Sheebie haven't had any shorts love
245620	250620	But finally, the shorts are working out and you know, people are ready to work on them
250620	254620	Oh Anonymous tipped me, hold on a minute, we have missed your tipped Anonymous
254620	256620	Give us the tip
256620	260620	Are you squiddin' me right now?
260620	264620	Thank you for giving us so many streams to share with you
264620	268620	Some of us are less active, but no less appreciative of how much you do
268620	274620	Ah, don't you worry, you bumberino, gibberino, schnibberino, woobberino
274620	278620	Anonymous, you don't have to fucking look

285620	288620	Thank you very much for the tip, that's very kind of you
288620	290620	And yes, I'm glad you can enjoy the daily content
290620	296620	Speaking of daily content, uh...
296620	301620	We're still on for daily streams, that's the good news
301620	306620	We're having a few health issues, okay?
306620	311620	So currently, oh I just realized I'm linking the ACSR
311620	315620	We're currently having some mild issues with health
315620	321620	That is, I basically, I go for a nap for four hours when I finish a stream
321620	328620	And then four hours before a stream, I'm having a nap, I'm not having a full sleep
328620	334620	And I had a dream about a VTuber that I haven't even met and don't exist before
334620	339620	So the lines are getting crossed, I'm fucking dreaming about VTubers
339620	341620	That aren't even real!
341620	345620	I'm gonna start fighting real sh- I'm doing Shadow Boxing for real
345620	351620	In my head, in my head, in my head
351620	355620	Is it Army? Army, Army
355620	359620	I don't know what that song is
359620	362620	So I'm starting to hallucinate a wee bit
362620	365620	Not quite at the hallucinatory stage, however
365620	369620	I am really struggling to wake up for streams
369620	373620	But my only other alternative option
373620	376620	Oh is it Zombie? No, what did I say? Army
376620	382620	Zombie, in my head, in my head
382620	387620	Zombie, zombie
387620	389620	Anyway, whilst I'm being distracted
389620	390620	We're playing a game called Stray
390620	393620	Apparently it takes five hours to do this game
393620	396620	Everyone went absolutely coconuts when this game dropped
396620	398620	I personally have not played it before
398620	399620	But it's got cats in it
399620	401620	And you know how we do around these parts
401620	404620	If you didn't know, Wham and Love It
404620	408620	When men like creatures or lesser beings
408620	410620	Because it shows that man is safe
410620	413620	If man does not like creature or lesser being
413620	414620	Man is not safe
414620	416620	Hmm, Monca es
416620	420620	But apparently we get to be a yin-yor cat
420620	423620	As well, not just any kind of cat, a yin-yor
423620	426620	Five hours if you're quick
426620	428620	Oh no
428620	430620	Oh my god
430620	432620	Why are we so skinny?
432620	434620	We need to fatten us up

569620	572620	And let us be like the front page of it and everything
572620	574620	And then proceeded to talk
574620	576620	Proceeded to celebrate a refund

4165760	4167760	Okay
4175840	4180880	Have I spoken to those guys? I don't think so. I don't want to take that in case it's like
4180960	4186000	Going the wrong way and have to climb all the way back up. Do you have another music sheet?
4186080	4188880	Oh, I don't know if I've got another song in me. Will we try it?
4191520	4194160	I definitely need to get up there, but how'd I get up there?
4195520	4197520	I don't know
4197520	4202160	Have I spoken to these two guys at the fire? I don't recall speaking to the guys at the fire

4251120	4255120	A strange notebook with a symbol on it. This one seems to belong to someone named climbing time
4255600	4258080	Everything is going according to plan. We've managed to
4259280	4260240	I can't read that fast
4260240	4266160	We managed to contact the upper level before the trans receiver went down. They are in a place called midtown
4266240	4272560	Apparently it's controlled by some kind of oppressive force. I talked to Momo earlier his eyes. I know his look
4272560	4276240	He will not come with us. I don't know what this means, but it'll probably be useful for there
4276560	4281840	We should go see the Momo person. I'm trying but I keep not walking into him
4282640	4284640	Okay, so there's like tons of

4320960	4322960	Two kittens
4323840	4325840	Forbidden from one another
4326720	4330400	Their parents debate their people

4360800	4368640	I'm not sure I can do this one. This one's probably the closest one to me not gonna lie

4736960	4741680	Uh, it's a strange notebook with a symbol on it. This one seems to belong to someone named the dog
4744400	4746960	After weeks of research I've confined a spectrum
4747440	4752880	Spectrometer with a powerful UV lamp with this it should be capable of warding the off dessert
4753840	4758000	The initial attempt was explosive. I might have to test on the real conditions

5065920	5074880	I have something I want to share and tell you it's something that I think you should care about
5075200	5078880	It's an information overload in this world of
5079520	5088000	Overgrown and everything inside is so looking. Okay. That was a really short one to try and come up with anything
5088080	5090080	Thank you. Mr. Musician
5090400	5093520	Um, unfortunately, I think I'm stuck right now. Um

5102000	5104000	I'm trying to freaking
5104560	5107280	You freaking freaks. I don't know how to progress
5108880	5110880	I don't know. Maybe I need to
5111280	5114800	Do I have enough energy drinks for the merchant? Hold on. How many energy drinks?
5116320	5123120	One two, right, so I don't have enough for whatever the merchants hiding so maybe that's what I need to get access to normal
5124720	5126720	I don't know
5127680	5129680	Uh
5130400	5136320	How'd it go? No, that's down close enough. I was one way or another honestly. You're doing great. Keep it up
5136400	5140800	Sweet. Oh, and we're going down again. Okay. It's fine. It's fine. I didn't need to go. Okay. It's fine. I didn't need to go up
5141680	5143440	uh
5143440	5147440	I like writing songs in my spare time. So I'm come up. I'm jealous you can come up with lyrics on the spot
5148400	5154160	I'm just going for it. Literally. It gives me a prompt. I'm not even rhyming properly. You're just being nice to me
5155120	5157520	Actually, I'm not even rhyming and I'm just like
5159520	5163280	That's me. Right. Okay. So that's me more right. How'd I get up?
5164160	5168160	I was kind of coming down from here. I've already been this way, right?
5170320	5174720	Sorry, it's probably have I been in here? Uh, this is the top of the bar
5176480	5178480	Oh, these are the two that I've never speak to
5180640	5182480	Hello
5182560	5188800	I left it in the streets and the next day the zarks consumed it. That's crazy. They can eat everything
5190000	5192000	Hello, can I rub against your legs?
5194160	5196160	I'm a male in your little heart
5197280	5201920	Yeah, that's great. You love the pooters. What's this?
5203520	5208640	Oh, is this where we're supposed to go if I actually progress the story line properly?
5209280	5211280	I
5211680	5216880	Shawnee trying not to fumble too hard. It's called improv. Shawnee. It's called improv. Oh, yeah
5217200	5221760	You like the way that I don't rhyme because I don't have enough time to prepare for what I'm going to say next. I don't
5223280	5225280	Right. I've already been in there. You can't fill me
5226080	5231920	Fill me once shame on you. Fill me twice shame on you. Is anyone played straight? Am I supposed to get the third thing now?
5232880	5235840	Despite what Shawnee says, she's actually a good thing, right?
5235840	5237840	I really don't
5257360	5259360	Wait, I'm an idiot. No
5260800	5262800	Pull the other way
5263120	5266640	I'm an idiot and it's been there the whole time. Am I going crazy?
5268080	5270080	Wait, no, have I been here? Am I good?
5277920	5279920	It's been here the whole time
5280960	5285760	Oh, okay, it's fine. It's fine. It's fine. It's fine. It's fine. It's been here the whole time

5300560	5302560	outsiders
5302560	5304560	Forbidden from one another
5305840	5307840	Um me

5314800	5316800	Uh, I want

5334320	5339280	My friends and I took her notes of her research about the outside here. Take mine if you really want to go there

5514720	5517200	There is a level above ours the ceiling the city has

5572080	5575840	I've been in that one. I've been in that one. So it's this one over here
5577600	5579600	How'd I get there
5580800	5582800	Okay getting that first
5585760	5587760	Yeah, I haven't been in that one
5590160	5592160	Sorry didn't mean to break it

5600320	5603760	Oh no, I'm gonna have to use my head right okay go across
5607440	5610640	Zanzibar was a player we player map in helo. Oh, maybe

5617360	5624400	Right if there's a symbol over here, did I go in this one or not? I think I took the ledge down. Yeah
5629600	5632640	Translate ventilation power supply
5634800	5636800	I need to break it
5642400	5644400	Okay, oh my god, we did it I get it
5645040	5652800	Okay, big jump be brave. Oh, you're fine. That's just a we drop. Sorry to scare you like that, buddy
5654880	5656880	Oh
5656880	5662880	Just that just a little bit of myth normally you're not really supposed to leave much of a trace behind but he will press y
5665120	5667120	Let me out
5667120	5670720	Okay, so we have a shortcut. Okay, but we need to
5670960	5672960	But
5673680	5678080	Hello, hello, hello, any oh, we got some fresh water
5679120	5684800	Speaking of water, I'm actually gonna open my bottle. Oh, no, I have a bottle of water from yesterday that is
5687440	5689440	Stop drinking we don't want you to pee everywhere
5692800	5696640	Chat we need to band together to mass spam bad cat puns. No
5700960	5703920	Shawna got me feeling something kind of way. Yeah, I like the necklace
5706240	5710880	Uh, right, there's there must be a book in here. Sorry. Wait. Whoa. What was that?
5712880	5714880	Wait, it's on top of the thing
5716880	5720160	Finally the last notebook this one seems to belong to Zanzaba
5721360	5725200	All traces of organic life has disappeared except for what we call deserves
5725520	5731840	They seem to eat almost anything that moves and breed at an inconceivable rate get it because they can see fast
5733120	5737920	Uh, it's it's as if being walked in the city wasn't hard enough. Oh
5738560	5742240	There's also a lot in this book. I said I found a design flaw in the transceiver
5742240	5746640	But I think I figured out how to fix it. Here's the equation with this. We should be able to help
5747200	5753120	Momo repair the transfer if it can communicate with the upper levels that could be our way up
5754080	5756800	Let's show him what fun. Okay, baby
5760640	5768080	Oh, there's a thing down there to remember. I see it. How'd I get there? Can I get done? I would like to remember
5770000	5772000	Member in the memory
5772720	5774720	What's this? C14
5777120	5780880	Remarkable companions have evolved so much in the early days
5780960	5782960	They're simple ai merely in
5783920	5791120	Imitated human art now. This is all on their own humans often said that making art is important in desperate situations
5791440	5793440	These are certainly desperate times
5795600	5797600	Getting his memories back
5798480	5806000	Uh, actually should I come back up again? I think so. Whoops. Oh, and I'm going further down. Oh, and I'm going further down still
5806080	5808080	Okay, let's just uh
5808320	5812720	Let's just climb up a different location. Sometimes it's a bit finicky
5813360	5815360	Right, I need to go top right
5817680	5819680	I've made an
5821520	5827120	I have made an incredible decision. We shall band together for now. We are Legion and meow
5828320	5830320	Or or is night from
5831520	5833520	What are you saying?
5834080	5836080	Why are you blue?
5837040	5840720	I have probably gone the longest way possible to get back to this guy. Sorry
5846880	5848880	Unfortunately
5849440	5854560	I don't wrong. Sorry. Sorry. It was a big jump. I shouldn't have done that to you. Oh, we need to go up
5856640	5858560	We're getting there
5858560	5862800	It's just taking me a hot second because I'm a little slow in the head
5862960	5865840	But I thank you for being patient for me reeflings
5867120	5873680	Okay, let's get up up ease. Hello. I did it. I got your quest items
5875520	5878720	Are you still looking for the notebook? Yes, that's all
5882000	5885680	That's his notebook, right? I never quite understood what he was talking about most of the time
5885760	5888720	But he was very wise. Wait, you actually found all my friends notebook
5889280	5896160	Oh, what's that? No, the transfer you were can be repaired. That's incredible. That means we should be able to communicate outside of the slum
5896880	5898800	Climbing time
5898800	5902160	Hey Johnny. Hi chat. Hi, Broly legend. Thank you for the tip
5902800	5904400	and
5904400	5909040	Climbing time doc. I'm sorry. I doubted our cause. I promise you'll find a way to reach the servers
5909120	5913120	Thank you. We might be able to find you a way up now. Let's fix this piece of junk trans receiver
5914720	5916720	The tv
5917120	5919120	Or diameter
5921520	5928000	Oh wait our friend in the programming thing said he'll fix anything. Oh, wait, he just did it come with me
5929440	5931440	Come with me
5939040	5941040	Up there see that building high above others
5941280	5942240	Yeah
5942240	5946560	If you install the transceiver at the very top of that tower, you should be able to communicate to go to the city
5946720	5949760	My friends might still be out there. If there's any way out, they'll know
5951360	5956240	There's only one small click enough to evade the zarks. We need you a little outsider. Bring us to the sky
5956960	5958960	That's kind of that lane kind of goes hard
5962320	5965920	Oh no, I need to get ready to run I think
5967200	5969200	Oh no
5970080	5972080	I don't like it already
5973200	5976000	When do they start jumping out at me? How much time do I have?
5981040	5987840	Oh no, oh no, this can't be right, okay
5990160	5992160	I can't even see where to go
5992160	5994160	I
5997120	6001760	Assume I just jump up from over there. I don't want them to grab me but we're gonna
6004160	6006160	That they're trying to get their attention
6011040	6013040	Okay
6015360	6019600	Uh, uh, uh, can I just hold a and you go up? Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Perfect
6020240	6023280	Okay, keep her going eggs bacon grits sausage
6024240	6026240	Got a flat ass, but it still takes sausage
6030320	6032320	Oh no
6033120	6037680	Oh no, oh get me up. Just get me up. Oh my god. Oh no
6039280	6043920	Oh my god, okay. Okay. What's the summer memory? Sorry. Are they chasing me?
6044080	6046080	Oh
6046400	6050480	I've got nine lines check. Yeah, the city is full of neon. It wasn't all this way
6050720	6055760	We used to be strict energy caps, especially in the slums, but people couldn't handle the concept dodging
6056240	6062240	One day someone lit up rainbow lamps neon signs all over the house that person was taken away and never seen the game
6062720	6068720	Again, but people saw hope and not long after everyone started putting lots of lights in their homes
6068800	6070960	There was nothing their pressers could do
6071040	6075360	It was the way for people to see colors again like on the outside. I think it helped
6078000	6081520	Okay, we're there progress. I don't want to go back down. Please don't make me go back down there
6082160	6084160	Is this not the way should we do we?

6454560	6456800	I was fine just a layer at the mold where I'm going
6457760	6459760	I was kind of kidding

6523680	6525680	That's terrifying
6526320	6528320	I'm so stressed
6528400	6530400	Are we safe?
6532720	6534720	Right

6543760	6547840	Okay, there's no orange around. I think I'm safe
6549120	6552560	Here is put the transceiver on the antenna this
6554800	6557200	Uh transceiver here you go
6557360	6559360	Oh
6568800	6570800	We did it
6571520	6578080	We're lighting it up. What does it mean? I don't really know. Well, we're communicating with the higher city, I guess
6582160	6584560	Hydration check little reefling
6585280	6589600	I love the aesthetics of this game. Yeah
6596000	6598000	Activate in the elevator. Oh, maybe
6602560	6609360	Look the view is beautiful from here. I remember now the city it was meant to be a shelter. Oh
6610080	6612080	No
6612400	6616560	Looks like those look like stars, but they're only light markings
6618000	6620960	Lights marking the hermetic
6621600	6623600	Roof sealing off the city
6624240	6628160	Mankind built the shelter to protect themselves from the outside
6628240	6630880	But I came at a cost nobody can get out
6631520	6636800	The outside was a disaster completely barren unlivable and dangerous
6639600	6643040	But if you come from there, it must mean it's safe again
6643680	6648080	And my promise wasn't just to go to the outside. It was to open the city
6650400	6652400	Yeah, is that your goal
6652560	6658400	I still don't understand why some memories are coming back and others aren't but I'm certain now. This is my purpose
6658960	6665440	I have to open the city. Come on. Let's get back and find Momo now that we've connected the transmitter
6665520	6667520	We should be able to get help
6668160	6670160	Okay, okay
6670560	6672560	Not bad
6674480	6679600	This is the longest ride we're putting a lot of faith in this little cat in a bucket honestly
6681600	6683600	Cola burp emote win
6684080	6687040	Soon everyone's emotes got submitted before me
6687600	6693600	Mercy has been accepted as errors. I'm waiting to be accepted and then mine are being done last because um
6694480	6695600	I
6695600	6701600	Want the girls stuff to be done first and reeflings you guys are actually like super understanding the slums part two
6701760	6703760	No, get me out of the slums. Come on. I've been here a little too long
6706240	6709760	Oh my god, I bought these for Gimli and Vigo and
6710800	6717360	Vigo doesn't play with toys and Gimli only plays with a specific toy that they discontinued and I'm absolutely reading
6718880	6720880	Oh, no, he went
6721120	6724000	Little outsider if you're all that's such a cute nickname
6724480	6727920	Little outsider if you're reading this that means you're still alive. Excellent
6728000	6731680	I took some equipment to the bar to take advantage of their antenna. Come meet me there
6732160	6735520	I've locked the window, but the code to open it is simple. It is
6739600	6745280	Be careful it's case sensitive. See at the bar that must be the code for the window near the entrance looks cool
6745360	6747360	Okay, the bar we know where the bar is
6747760	6749760	Oh this
6751680	6753680	Oh
6757920	6759920	Okay, that was I thought amen
6761120	6765440	The code at the bar. Sorry. I get it now. Okay. Uh, let me
6766240	6769200	refresh my memory of the city really quickly
6771040	6775920	Uh, I can't remember where the bar is, but you know what we'll just make our way down
6776560	6778560	And hope we're going the right way

6820960	6827120	Hi, mommy. This cat ears look cute. Yeah, I'm a necklace today. Oh, I've almost got it
6830080	6832080	Hello, can anyone hear me?
6832480	6839200	Hello, yes, we can hear you. We're from the slums. We're looking for a way out and wait, is that you zanzibar?
6840480	6842480	Momo
6843520	6849040	I can't believe it. I'm so happy to hear your voice zanzibar. Where are you? Are the others okay? Yes
6849840	6852640	We are safe. We found a way up
6852640	6854640	Up
6856160	6862400	Hello, do you still hear me? You have to go through the sewers to reach us. It's very dangerous
6863440	6865440	It's not because everywhere
6866880	6868880	Sewers, how? Hello
6869600	6871920	Darn it. We've lost the signal
6872720	6877200	I can't believe it. Zanzibar is alive. He and the other outsiders managed to go up through the sewers
6877520	6883040	The sewers are the most dangerous place in the slums, but if zanzibar made it there must be a way
6893600	6899200	You'll never get past the sewers. It's infested with zirks. They'll make a quick meal out of you
6899360	6901360	Especially you little one
6902080	6905520	Many tried their luck in the past and it does the end well
6906080	6910720	Anyway, I warned you. Your business is none of my business
6914160	6916160	Oh, he he gave him a warning
6919760	6920400	Mmm
6920400	6927760	Sumis his father doc used to be a great scientist who was working on some new weapon to fight the zirks
6928240	6931840	A few years ago. He went off to test the device. I love a cave back
6932400	6934400	Seamuses never in the south
6935200	6937200	up here
6937760	6939760	Not so good
6941440	6946000	Don't listen to seamus. He's just scared like I was a doc bill weapon
6946160	6948160	That's our ticket to join the outsiders
6948880	6955920	In his notebook doc mentioned a secret lab a few times that must be where he was working on it
6956320	6961280	There might be a clue in Seamuses apartment. Come on. Follow me
6962800	6964800	I'll follow you
6964880	6966880	I will follow you
6967200	6969200	Follow you wherever you
6969520	6971520	mainly
6971600	6974320	Because I'm just a kitty cat
6975520	6980080	Down in the slums without my little family
6981440	6986400	Of shot no are in is it two tail two dots
6987280	6991760	Two dots on tail. I've forgotten in the other cat. Oh, he's still cleaning it off
6992800	6998960	Bro, I think you're gonna have to get a mural down or something because uh, yeah, but you ain't cleaning up paint on concrete
7000400	7005360	Oh, is this a uh, no point in translating. I thought it was a memory. Oh knock knock
7007280	7009280	Let us in
7009680	7016560	Two dots poke a dot. Oh, that sounds right. Come on. Seamus open the door. You know, your father would have wanted to help us
7017440	7022160	Two dots poke a dot shot noir and Cali Cali Cali Caloo
7022960	7028400	Well, that was to be expected the situation is pretty tough on Seamus. He doesn't want to hear about the outsiders
7028400	7031200	He won't help me, but you I think I have an idea
7032800	7036320	Okay, what's your idea Momo?
7039680	7045760	Oh, I'm to go in are you sure here take doc's notebook and show it to Seamus
7046720	7050480	It contains a lot of information that will hopefully act as an electoral shock
7051040	7054400	Find the secret lab little outsider. Oh, that's such a cute name
7054800	7059840	I'm going back to the bar to try and re-establish communication with others. Okay. Thank you Momo
7061360	7063360	Hi Seamus

7161840	7166240	These blueprints. They must be for dessert weapon. Wait, you said I didn't get a gun
7167360	7172320	Papa was always so secretive with his work. He told me the weapon was working in theory
7172400	7176640	But I needed a real life test. He went outside the slums and he never came back
7178560	7180560	That must be very sweet
7180800	7182800	The bugs
7183840	7185600	Translate
7185600	7191360	Observations cute sound, but never friendly old bacteria of human time eat all kinds of materials total

7726680	7730400	it was a symbol of the division between those in the slums and in midtown that
7730400	7733640	and the fact that they kept throwing their garbage down here what horrible thing

7841900	7845780	Could see it I could see where the under passage was cuz they lit it up
7845780	7851740	I have to admit the game design with lighting up where you're supposed to go next. I appreciate greatly
7855540	7857540	Is that trolley
7858540	7860540	That's quite a lot to dodge
7863340	7865340	Hey

7908020	7913960	Can hear something is it just frogs like ambience or is like is it something that's gonna there's nothing orange though
7914960	7920800	The video game wouldn't be so cruel as to not show orange if there's enemies nearby surely the game wouldn't do that
7921520	7923520	No, those are frogs
7924280	7926280	I'm actually a really good fool
7928280	7931680	Same leg it's never fully healed per thing. Oh
7933520	7935520	No
7937080	7939080	Where they need to go
7940040	7942040	Hold on
7942520	7947040	Hold on I'm about to cross a barrier where they need to go. I can't see
7947840	7952120	Just jump across the bridge and then to the right cuz it's all lit up there
7959920	7963040	Oh you turn hold on this is lit up. Oh
7968520	7970520	Use item
7971120	7978640	An energy drink. Well, it's definitely no way hmm. It's an electrical generator, but it seems to require some other part function. Okay
7982200	7988240	Okay, we're not gonna get jumped on this side, I don't think because of that generator we need to come back to it
7989760	7993280	Did we follow the cable? I think so
7996040	7998600	Okay, when the music gets intense I'll start screaming
8001280	8003280	I
8006080	8008080	Really don't want to make noise. Oh
8015120	8020600	Thank goodness it's in a cage, why is it in a cage because that baits clearly
8022040	8024040	What generate? Uh
8024560	8026560	Hello
8027000	8029000	Is this on its head? Oh, hello
8031040	8033040	Oh
8033400	8038960	Sorry, didn't mean to scare of course the scientist has like crazy cables coming over this here
8040280	8042280	Wow
8042320	8047520	Wait, you're not a zerk. Who are you? That's my badge you're wearing. How'd you find it?
8047560	8053920	Did my son send you? Oh, see miss you clever boy. You've been alone here for oh, I've been alone here for ages
8053920	8059200	I came here to test my defluxor, but it didn't go as planned. I wish I could go back home
8059200	8060840	I miss my son daily
8060840	8065640	You can have a look around the house if you want, but I have no idea how to escape this place
8067760	8073520	What do you what do you mean? Wait, you're not gonna say knows what to do remember
8075800	8082080	What do you remember little buddy? I've seen humans wear costumes like I mean similar
8082080	8086680	They were small and running around making lots of noise. Oh, they were children. Yes
8087000	8093240	The streets felt much more alive with children even with the difficulty they brought the adults seem to love them very much
8093320	8098440	Doc says he misses Seamus. Is this the same thing? Yeah, it is. Oh
8099360	8102560	No, no, he's out of beverages. Oh dear
8103760	8105760	What's going on here?
8106880	8108880	Hello radio. Oh
8112240	8114240	Why oh
8117680	8119680	I
8122320	8124320	Was this mean
8124960	8129440	But Morty you go to shove the mega seats. Oh, it does kind of oh, no
8130200	8132200	It does look a wee bit like Rick
8133840	8138120	Hey, be careful with the defluxor at fill charge it can explode zirks like
8140400	8144840	What do you mean be careful give give me it meow
8145840	8151320	This baby needs 1.21 gigawatts to work and the only thing around here that
8151480	8157080	Kind of just as a generator outside the house. The problem with that is it's not gonna start
8157080	8162520	I think a fuse blew and with all the zirks around it's too dangerous for me go and fix it
8163360	8167560	I'm not fast enough, but you might be if you reach the generator and replace the fuse
8167560	8172560	It should be able to get the defluxor recharge. Come on. Follow me. I'll show you what to do
8173320	8177080	Okay, I'm listening. Are you about to give me a weapon?
8177880	8183360	Do I need to not be absolutely terrified and shitting my panty loners? Hmm?
8184480	8188160	Cuz they just we ship my pants when it comes to these bad boys
8190000	8196720	Well, I was actually already at the generator, so I know where to go here take this fuse is brand new
8196840	8203360	Okay, thank you turning on the generator will be allowed to expect company once you fix the generator
8203360	8205360	It should be able to charge
8205440	8212320	The kick and kick start the defluxor you just need to follow this cable change the fuse and meet me back here
8212320	8218400	Best of luck. Okay, so there's gonna be a bit of a jump sequence once we start it, but that's fine. We know where to go
8220080	8222560	Surely they wouldn't spawn them in right now surely
8222560	8229320	Surely they wouldn't spawn them in right now. No, it's after I do the generator. Okay
8230400	8234040	The game is giving me a grace period. It's either I take a right or a left here
8239560	8242560	Okay, now what were they coming from I can do it
8245400	8248400	I can do it ominous red glow
8253160	8255160	Hey
8256760	8258760	Yes, give me that technology
8261720	8264680	Wait what I can't cross
8265920	8272080	Oh my god, bro, you're gonna need to aim bought this stuff. I can't get across cuz they're coming on the bridge
8274480	8279560	They need to wait until it involves the mall doc you need better aim I
8280480	8283000	Can't even get along the bridge
8293480	8297640	Think I'm okay, okay, you actually didn't do a bad job
8302120	8304120	Why would you do that game
8304880	8310440	You know that would scare me
8311640	8316640	This isn't a horror game. Why would you do that? Get me inside right now? Oh my god
8319600	8323960	Doc is beaming. Yeah, oh you celebrate is so happy hydration chair
8326800	8330760	Amazing you got the generator back on heck. Yeah, dude. You're well. Yeah

8336280	8338280	Doody and me duty and I
8341520	8344720	Yeah, my voice is unfortunately breaking at the moment
8345880	8350720	Have you seen how powerful the defluxer is it's definitely our way out here wait a minute
8350720	8354520	I might be able to mount this defluxer to your drone
8354520	8356640	Oh, that's exactly what I want to hear doc
8356760	8362920	Give me um, you know that guy that smashes like money on the table gif and basically that right now

8367880	8369880	Oh, he popped
8379040	8381040	Thank you
8381400	8384720	It works the defluxer is now installed on your fancy drone
8384920	8389320	It's not meant to run off such a small amount of power if you use it too much a kid malfunction
8389320	8394400	Just remember it's dangerous. Now. Let's go back to the village. I'm coming home to my son. Oh
8395200	8397200	That's so adorable
8399800	8401800	You had I do press a
8403400	8406120	No, he's jumping on it. Wait, how do I use it?
8406120	8408120	Oh
8416480	8418480	Yeah, oh
8418720	8426280	My god, okay, it's a wee bit short. That's fine. It's better than nothing. I'ma take it. I must take it. Okay

8432880	8435240	Take out all those darks and we can get through yes
8436520	8440400	Wow, oh, sorry, I did it a bit quicker than the store. Well, it's working great
8440400	8443800	But as expected it can overheat let it cool for a bit when that happens
8443800	8446320	I hope we will last until we reach the village. Don't say that
8447520	8452640	Why don't you bring your freaking big-ass one as well? Why does it have to be down to me?
8453280	8457200	Like I'm a freaking cat. I'm literally in my head like oh
8458680	8461640	They're gonna start jumping out of those honestly. Oh
8462680	8464680	This is gonna make me so nervous
8465520	8467520	What's the dealio here
8470560	8474040	The switch doesn't work. I look like the electricity's been caught. I

9309040	9310120	Heptor
9310120	9313840	He's sitting on a little bucket next to a sofa

9493240	9500880	I think it's nice that the eventually mimic human is quickly missed them and in that way they kind of kept them from going extinct
9501000	9503000	They're good robots
9503240	9508880	Okay, we did it and then we'll go our last song. I don't know what it's gonna be, but let's find out. I

10039540	10043780	Maybe one month we won't we'll beat the peeler allegations, but this month is not that month
10046180	10048180	Thank you for the tip really legend
10049460	10052100	Why why are we peeing on main? What's going on?
10052340	10058900	Um, wait, I can't go in that. That's murky water. Wait, so what was I supposed to do here? Is really a secret?
10061780	10063780	Can I pop these?
10067700	10069940	Um, was there even anything?
10072660	10079860	Wait, no, this is the dead end. Is the water shallow and it just looks like it's not or am I going crazy?
10082900	10084900	Yeah
10091700	10093700	Uh
10097700	10099940	Were they gonna pop as I walked past I think
10101540	10104500	Remind me who started the allegations. I actually don't know
10104900	10112820	No, we must move through the stagnant pee water on a plate. Look at the menacingly looking at me
10112820	10117060	They don't know that I'm I've got a strap. I'm built carry. You know, I'm saying I'm carrying right now
10117220	10120980	No, no, no, I saw it. I can see a bend. It's a secret. It must
10128340	10133300	Yeah, you better be better be watching out for me. I'm a jumpy
10134980	10138580	I'm a murder you and I'm gonna make a little like an accident
10140820	10142820	Okay, these are active
10146180	10148180	Hold on
10151700	10153700	So like how their butts get open
10154020	10159620	Wasn't that in me with her drinking stream where chat blackmailed her into recording that is that where it starts?
10160340	10162340	Oh
10163940	10167460	My my little sister isn't so innocent anymore. She can
10170980	10172980	Okay
10174180	10176980	I didn't mean to activate another one but fine. It's fine
10178980	10180980	Try not to overheat it too much
10184340	10186980	I can do it like that and just kind of see someone as they come
10189860	10191860	I
10192260	10195700	Think emmy is more likely to do it and she be no different not that one
10195940	10200980	I know it was just sort of a throwaway line, but I can't get an idea of strongy pheromone max and out of my head
10201300	10205940	Oh, it's because I'm fucking minion. Sorry, but I'm like an absolute like knee. I'm not being funny
10207140	10210660	Like I didn't go outside if I don't need to go outside. I don't like
10211620	10216580	I kind of discussed I don't even know if I should talk about it. You guys will be like so disgusted by it
10217460	10218900	but like
10218900	10223060	I don't even wear deodorant because I'm gonna go outside so it's like why it was the point of being deodorant
10225140	10227140	Um
10227860	10230020	But I hope my dad's not mad at me when he sees me
10231700	10234740	He's gonna be like strongy. You're like shit and I'm like, yeah
10237460	10239460	Oh, come on literally one
10239540	10241540	I
10245700	10248580	Hope one of the upcoming emotes is sniff. I mean if you want
10249220	10252420	Uh, I've got more than 10 like emotes slots
10252980	10259140	Unlock how many heart mojis are there like what's the highest number it goes up to because that's how many emotes slots are unlocked
10260980	10263060	But I'm not nice. There's so many
10263700	10272180	15 okay, so I'm getting a batch of 10 and then I get an extra five and then if I make more then
10273300	10275300	You know
10276100	10278100	Yeah, I know I'm definitely open to that
10279220	10281220	God this place is like
10281780	10288900	Well, there is this how you're supposed to tackle these areas just this feels like cleaning simulator now a little bit just kind of like
10294020	10296740	Oh, oh that guy popped in with
10299220	10303220	The hunger for the cat flash is okay the last couple of years from brothel everyone
10307300	10310900	It's not even that I tried to be mingin or anything, but I just I'm mingin
10311860	10317380	Like when I'm like when I say see is like, oh, I've not showered in a few days or whatever. I'm like, it's not a
10317780	10323700	Teehee. I'm so gross and nasty. It's like no, I ain't showered rough a fucking reek
10324660	10326660	I got be all out of the wazoo
10326820	10328820	I've got greasy hair out of the wazoo
10331860	10333860	That's a little it
10335140	10337140	Yeah, if you don't sweat it's pretty okay
10338980	10342740	Oh, no, I'm ready. Sorry, but I'm actually ready for you guys. I'm not being serious
10342980	10344980	I
10346500	10351860	I'm so ready. I'm not scared anymore. I can hardly see anything by the way. I don't know why there's like a duff freaking
10352500	10355940	Filler and of course it goes away the moment I complain about it because why wouldn't it?
10358580	10360580	Okay, let's just let's just go next
10365300	10367300	Yeah, that's right. You can't scare me now
10368420	10370900	You can maybe jump scare me around a corner, but that's about it
10372740	10374740	I
10374980	10376980	Whoa
10377060	10379060	Where are the eyes?
10379140	10383940	Hold on. Hold on. This seems like a bit much. I don't think the torch can handle all of this
10393460	10397140	There's no way I'm supposed to be being seen in Dungeon Mad down here
10397620	10399620	Oh
10403220	10408260	Oh the game's lagging because it's loading a new area, right that's manageable
10414740	10416740	Wow
10417060	10419060	I
10422660	10427460	Stony really gets stinky if I am I'm literally turning us all into Napoleon dynamite
10428580	10430580	Can I go through here?
10432420	10434980	I'm coming back in three days don't want
10437060	10442420	God it really does not oh the eyes are asleep on the wall
10443140	10446580	I can't do anything to the eyes. Hmm
10448980	10451940	I have to wash my hair every other day, but we don't seem to wash it off
10452820	10455460	Oh, I used to have really greasy hair
10456020	10460740	And I would have to wash it every day like I'd wake up and it'd be fecking greasy and smooth
10461940	10467460	But ever since I've been using lush shampoo bars, I actually get like a couple of days with it
10468100	10470100	And which is really nice
10470420	10475540	Um, so I can't recommend lush shampoo bars enough to be honest
10475700	10481540	So if you're ever if you've got the money to treat yourself, it is a bit more expensive, but like
10482980	10486820	As far as I'm aware they they pay their employees a bit more decently
10487540	10491060	Or probably publicity stunt. I have yet again fallen for you know, have you?
10491540	10493540	Um
10494340	10496340	Oh
10508580	10514980	No, do not tap it. Okay. Sorry. I'll just test them because I keep overheating the poor guy, but
10516260	10522740	Just the should men use it. Yep. It's just a generic shampoo bar. It's called jumping juniper on the lush website
10523220	10527940	It is literally, um, you put it on your head as you're in the shower or in the bath
10528340	10532820	And it lathers up and then that's you dunzel. Um, open the door though
10533700	10535700	Oh hacker man, we're in
10538820	10540820	Oh, we've done it now
10544340	10546340	What the
10547300	10549300	Oh
10550980	10556660	Is he gonna send an up? Okay. Yeah, he doesn't like it. I don't like it either
10558900	10561300	Oh my god, they just send more what the
10562100	10564100	break
10565700	10573140	Bruh, bruh, no, no, no, that's outrageous. Sorry. That's outrageous. Yeah, no wonder I'm fucking dead. What the fuck was that?
10576740	10578740	I
10580340	10582340	Saw is that was outrageous
10587860	10593700	And it reloaded all of those freaking egg sacs that are in my way, so I need to destroy them all so I can get a clear
10596740	10598740	And I'm gonna overheat again
10599300	10601300	I
10604420	10610900	Huh, right, so what I need to do I need to be able to wait. I can't even run across there super easily
10610980	10614020	I have to go down here and do a u-turn
10619380	10621380	That's ridiculous
10623220	10625700	If you're gonna give me a battery that like
10628980	10630980	I
10635300	10638020	At least make it last that's all I'm asking seriously
10638660	10642980	If you're gonna give a weapon to defend yourself, then you make like some fucking stupid ass
10643700	10645700	map like that
10649460	10653620	I'm sure there's probably some tactics I've not figured out yet, but that was really annoying
10653780	10656820	That was like, okay. Yeah, just keep sending it. Okay, great. Thanks
10659300	10669060	All right, let's hopefully we don't mess up this time. I'll start on this end because why not and what difference does it make?
10673300	10675300	He's already awake
10684020	10686520	Hold on. Sorry, I'm tryharding. I'm actually tryharding
10689620	10695220	I'm actually fucking tryharding and a fucking cat game. Please open the bloody thing
10700820	10703860	Wait, I could just use these barrels and jump across and I've been done
10706580	10708580	I was those barrels not available
10709940	10713460	Go right. You don't have to tell me twice to get the heck out. Oh for
10713460	10718020	What and the F
10725540	10727780	Hey, I'm feeling a bit intimidated as well. I ain't gonna lie
10731300	10733300	We are being perceived
10743700	10745700	I
10756740	10762660	Uh, oh, please don't cut to me. Please don't cut to me. Oh, I cut to me and cut to me
10763460	10765460	Oh
10769540	10773220	I cut to me. Why did you cut? Why can't I not just have been a cute little cutscene?
10773700	10779140	Well, I've been to if it was just an adorable little cutscene of how fast I can run and I didn't have to do this section
10779940	10784900	Oh, wouldn't that be adorable? Oh, that'd be so kawaii-ne, kawaii-ne, kawaii-ne, kawaii-ne, so kawaii-ne
10785540	10787540	Kawaii, kawaii, kawaii, kawaii, kawaii, kawaii, kawaii
10787540	10789540	Oh

10810580	10817540	That was awful. Can we get an upgrade on the duration of this little bad boy, please?
10819300	10824500	Wake up. Don't leave me alone. Please. I'm too scared to play this game alone now that I have you
10826100	10828900	Literally be 12 more like be reflin get it?
10829780	10833860	It was dark. I was alone. I felt like I was back in the network, but you saved me
10833860	10837460	Thank you friend. Enjoying that much power was rough on my core. The defluxer is completely
10840260	10846580	I was just praising this game for freaking not having to run away
10850820	10857620	I'm stressed. I thought this was supposed to be a cute cat game and I'm so stressed
10858980	10862340	Wait, you didn't hack it. Oh, you did hack it. Hold on. Oh, let's go before the fan goes on
10862900	10864900	Right, so we are
10865780	10870500	It's a flying refling. Yeah, you're literally gated me through the game. Yeah, yucky toxic
10872740	10876660	Okay, we can't say remember we can't say we can't say
10881700	10885780	Oh, hello friend, that means no enemies. Hello
10886820	10888820	Oh, hi, yo
10889140	10894260	A traveler from the sewers you haven't seen one of you in ages. Are you the one who contacted? Yes. I'm little
10894900	10899700	Zanzibar the outsider has been expecting you. He's meditating at the top of her village
10901540	10903540	Whoa
10906580	10908580	Huh
10908660	10914660	Wait, can they see the can they see the sky? Oh, sorry, we're gonna cut scene my apologies
10919140	10922420	I am sure that would be the last of them surely copium
10923380	10930500	Uh praying that the fluxer can be fixed the machine the scientist I insisted used one of these
10932740	10940900	He was sick. This was the last hope he walked into the machine, but I wasn't with him. He was alone. What was he doing?
10942580	10947700	Cryopods he uploaded himself into the computer and then everything was different
10947860	10949860	The
10951540	10953540	Bots aren't bots at all. They're humans
10955460	10962820	But the upload something went wrong. He was stuck for hundreds of years until a little cat appeared you
10965060	10967060	You're a human in a bot
10968420	10975860	Oh, no, he got a dolly zoom effect. It was me. I was the scientist
10977700	10979700	I was human
10982100	10985380	I need a moment. Oh, you are human
10990820	10994740	Maybe the world was dying so you had the choice to become a ball
10996740	10998740	Hello
10999380	11001380	Oh, you're covered in paint
11002020	11004020	Scratch board
11004580	11006740	Hello, oh, what are you playing?
11007860	11014820	What is this? Mahjong? Mahjong? Oh like they've got a little spot for me to play. Can I play?
11018020	11021220	I'm so sorry. Oh, no, I'm so sorry
11022580	11026500	Are you actually mad at me? Can I make it up to you? Can I rub against your leg? I'm sorry
11027140	11030100	Oh, no, they're actually picking up the pieces. I'm so sorry
11031460	11034020	Sorry, it wasn't my intention
11034980	11036980	Member? Oh, we've got a member
11038900	11042900	You render scrabble? I'm so cat-like. I'm sorry. I
11044820	11047300	I need a moment. I don't feel like talking right now. Okay
11049300	11053940	Yeah, that's probably a lot to process. I'm not gonna lie
11056180	11061300	That's a unique tea tree top. Maybe we don't need a farm roof lens. Maybe we just need a tree top
11064020	11070740	And we can all have different levels and stuff. Although I might get a bit chilly. So I think we'd I think maybe the farm would keep us warm
11071620	11074020	I think a tree top open like this would be too cold
11076020	11078020	What else have I forgotten?
11078900	11084260	I must have had parents friends. What happened to everyone? I wanted to open the city
11084260	11090580	But is there anyone else left to save? Oh, don't doubt your mission now soldier. Oh wait, we need to find this, sorry
11091540	11098980	Zanzibar, we need to talk to you friend wherever you are. Oh, you're bloody Zanzibar. He's a hippie
11101140	11103140	Oh, they got the fortune cat teller
11104420	11108340	That's it. I'm getting Chinese. Where's my Chinese auntie? What is this?
11110260	11112260	I've got a jump scare
11112980	11114980	Eh?
11115780	11119940	This is Zanzibar. Hey, don't you know not to interrupt a fellow during his
11121220	11122740	Transcendental
11122740	11124340	Transcendental
11124340	11130340	Meditation. Oh, it's you. You're with Momo when we received that call earlier. I'm glad to meet you at last little outsider
11130340	11136900	Eh, that's in you. You know Momo and Doc. So you're already familiar with those outsiders. I miss them. Their memories bring me peace
11137380	11142740	Momo stayed in the slums. I heard you helped find the doctor and clementime
11142820	11145860	She's in midtown now. If you still want to see the outside
11146340	11148340	She's the one you can go to
11148580	11150580	You that can get you there
11150980	11157380	Apparently she had some kind of plan to leave the city here. Now take this. I wrote her address on the back of this picture
11158900	11164020	Okay, I'm sorry. I just teared myself in on that mono-controller hydration check
11166900	11173700	To reach midtown claim up our little village. It should be easy for your oh for a dexterous one like you
11174820	11179700	If you manage to reach the outside you will be the very first. I wish you good luck, but you don't need it
11179780	11181780	I believe in you. Oh
11182500	11184500	Does he predict that we make it?
11185380	11189620	I'm sorry for shutting down earlier. I'm human probably the last in the world
11190020	11194580	Now look what's left of me so much has come back to me. How much have I forgotten?
11194820	11200420	Maybe if we find clementime, we can restore my memories and get you back home at the same time
11200580	11205220	We can go back down and find out more from the companions or head onwards
11206980	11208980	um
11210020	11212340	I think we just press onwards to be honest
11213460	11215300	I know you can
11215300	11219700	Someone said you can a hundred percent this game if it's like just hundred percent with memories like
11220740	11222740	Sorry, I've gone it. She knows
11223700	11228420	The Japanese golden cat also known as the beckoning cat typically depicted as a cat with one piece
11228580	11231140	Paul raised believe to bring good luck and fortune to them
11232580	11234260	Oh, we can play darts
11234260	11237300	I'm thinking it'd be a bit hard. I don't have a poseable thumb
11237620	11238820	Hi
11238820	11245780	What we cooking back here good-looking all the boulder recipes. That's so smart. Honestly. That's so smart
11246820	11248820	All right, you ain't getting that idea. I don't even
11248820	11250820	know
11251060	11253060	Uh, where was that ladder? I just saw other
11256740	11259700	It's also just nice to chat with the people if we aren't going for a hundred percent

13316400	13321920	Which is frustrating because it would be nice if you could do like all the borja towers in one swoop
13322240	13324800	But you would be very op at the start of the game
13324880	13329840	But I like games that give you access to the full thing and don't like hold back or anything

13769120	13771120	I don't know what happens
13772240	13774240	Nothing makes sense if we can't done
13775360	13778240	We're locked off right we're gonna have to go an alternative route
13779440	13782000	I assume is what this is pointing to
13782480	13788480	We're taking down the high-bot table. Honestly who would have thought the cat would finish through a John Wick started
13790320	13793520	I need to like climb off. Yeah
13797440	13799440	What is so neon
13800560	13802560	My little gamer eyes can't handle it right now
13805840	13807840	I really be oh remember, okay
13812640	13817920	This spot is nice what I wouldn't give to actually feel the softness of the pillows or the taste of a cold drink
13818320	13821840	This drone is useful, but I miss having my own body. I miss feeling. I miss
13822480	13828480	Hurting I miss being hungry. I know this isn't helping, but what if we stayed just a little longer? Thanks for listening. I'm ready now
13829040	13831040	Oh little buddy. It's okay
13833600	13836000	Is this gonna put me down it is
13837840	13839440	Hmm
13839440	13843040	I don't know how to get into this apartment complex. It's been cut off by the polis
13844960	13848480	To see police. I it's actually Gaelic
13849280	13851280	and Scott Slang
13851440	13853440	Polis is the same
13853600	13855840	Yeah, I'm just getting further away from the complex
13858400	13861600	Unless I'm to go up here. Hold on wait, maybe I was on the right track
13864880	13867040	Looks like I can climb up here question mark
13868000	13870000	Not
13871600	13872800	Unless
13872800	13878000	I'm getting very turned around. I'm pretty sure the apartment complex is like eight miles that way. Let me in
13879600	13881600	Let me in
13882160	13884160	Let me in
13885680	13889920	I don't know what the downstairs neighbors are up to but keep hearing bugs on hammers
13890880	13892880	Okay, that's definitely the one I'm supposed to know
13894320	13896320	Can we go anywhere?
13897040	13898160	No
13898160	13900160	Can I go up on that?
13900800	13902080	No
13902080	13906400	Right, right. I'm in the wrong direction. Hold on. Let's recalibrate our headings
13909280	13912240	And if we can go down actually because I'm going the wrong way
13913120	13917040	I'll need to check out what the police are doing. I'll talk to all the people at the police the policemen
13917760	13919760	police
13919760	13921760	Oh
13922800	13924800	My god
13924800	13927040	Uh, right you talk with
13927920	13932240	Hey, you think you can stop us from handling hanging an hour and six
13934640	13937040	All this work for nothing. What happened?
13943760	13948080	I'm like looking for routes or anything but I'm being prepared
13948320	13951760	So does any reeflings know where I'm supposed to go?
13953840	13956320	There's bars I didn't there's no point in being inside it
13958000	13962640	I want to say I have to take a right because honestly the game was designed for me to take a right
13963920	13966880	Hold on or maybe I can like go in here. No, I can't
13968080	13973280	You're awesome. There you go. It's hard to figure out like what the game wants you to do when you're
13973680	13975680	Then you know where to go
13975760	13980800	So because like obviously we can't really use the light theory right now. I was like, oh the light will guide you
13981760	13983920	Really the thing's pointing them where I'm supposed to go
13985920	13987920	Danger
13988160	13990160	I don't believe I want to see it
13992880	13994880	Light theory isn't working right now
13996800	13999040	And none of those people are talking to me
14000000	14002640	The meow will gauge you okay, hold on
14004080	14008800	Yeah, I can't talk to you. I'll talk to the people in the bar. Maybe they'll tell me what's up. Hey, can you tell me where to go?
14010560	14014960	I've mastered every game that ever existed but can't figure out how this one am I not seeing the whole picture here
14017200	14019200	What game snooker
14022400	14026720	You need the you need the chalk is that what you need the snooker chalk
14027440	14030960	She's overthinking it so hard wait barriers
14034080	14036080	Oh for fuck's sake
14037280	14039280	Oh, there's sentinels hold on
14040400	14042400	Okay
14042880	14044880	Okay, what does it do?
14046000	14049600	Of course, of course the tiny cat can slip under I'm sorry
14050880	14053200	That makes perfect sense and I'll honestly
14054000	14056000	I
14056480	14061680	Just like I need I forget I need to remember like I'm tiny and small and adorably cute
14070960	14072960	You don't move right
14077840	14079840	Do you look away
14081040	14083040	You do
14083600	14089040	What about you I saw you I think I've got time. I've not got time. That's not where I'm supposed to go
14101040	14105200	Not here hold on have to use my brain hold on
14107600	14109600	Ready, where do you go?
14109920	14115360	Okay, it's giving jump giving jump
14118560	14122480	Not really a jump is it uh, how'd I go out? Oh
14129520	14131520	You move
14134080	14136080	You don't move okay, that's fine
14140320	14142320	Oh
14149120	14151120	Okay, we made it
14151120	14158080	That was a some stealth app that meant this game is actually really fair in its gameplay other than oh no, she's like what hello
14162400	14164400	Is she up there
14166880	14168880	She must be up there
14169040	14171280	Or she left me a note being like I've popped my clogs
14178880	14180880	Uh
14181920	14185440	Am I going crazy did I not just she left me a note
14188000	14190160	Look at clue. Oh god, she's hiding somewhere
14191040	14193040	Uh claim
14193200	14198240	No sign of claim here. Okay. Oh, what's that? It looks like some kind of a coded message
14198480	14204880	We're gonna have to play detective to figure out what happened to her. Look for b12 in the cat the answer lies in my stuff
14205040	14207040	And then there's four symbols
14212160	14217040	What okay, one's a lava lamp. I know that's upstairs the rock is upstairs as well
14219120	14221120	Wait that level lamps right there
14221840	14223840	I
14226720	14228720	Not that level lamp
14230080	14234480	Right the level lamp up here and spit is that we think
14239840	14243360	There's also a hidden message under the container it says I'm with okay
14244480	14249440	And then there was a level lamp up here. Okay. Okay. And then a level lamp up here
14250160	14252160	I was level up right there
14256080	14258640	Maybe not this level lamp in particular. Okay inspect
14260080	14263840	We need a belly last a huge huge huge laugh. Yes, they're coming
14265360	14271040	Um, this gem is a medium value in low purity. The glow seems to have been added artificially
14271200	14275840	Maybe it's the axis of beacon for us to find something useful bingo. Is it says blazer?
14276160	14279920	Okay, am I going crazy, but strongly seems tamer. Uh, I am
14282400	14284720	I am non-functioning sleep at the moment
14284880	14291600	I basically sleep for four hours after stream and then I sleep before our four hours before stream
14291840	14297360	Like I've not had a full sleep in a couple of weeks now, so I wouldn't be surprised if I sound not myself
14298720	14300720	So don't be scared
14300720	14303280	I can't believe it. My hyper reachable isn't hyper
14303280	14308640	Wait, where's the note? I can't I can't remember the other two objects. I'm supposed to find
14310880	14314880	No clue here. No, I know I'd what wait, what's the piece of paper?
14316160	14319120	Um a cone a cone
14322880	14324720	Inspect why not?
14324720	14329600	That's all right, right. You find something you don't say into the nature. I'm just clicking exit stuff. I'm gonna be honest
14330320	14332960	Oh, I heard the noise you bleep
14336720	14340720	You're bleeping at something I don't know what it's in this area
14342880	14344720	Sure
14344720	14350480	I don't want nothing to have an apartment. It's the way the companion see the humans. That's kind of funny. Oh wait the the cone
14351440	14355120	Like something it says come to someone. Okay. Oh
14356080	14358080	Right and then one last item which
14358960	14360960	What is number one a plant?
14361040	14363040	Is it in the kitchen?
14363600	14366880	Oh, you're worrying about your sleeping health. I don't know what to do
14368000	14370560	I honestly don't oh we love her. Um
14372000	14373200	I'm a bit
14373200	14374720	Mucked up
14374720	14376720	That's not a warren can
14377600	14379600	Yeah, it's definitely a warren. Yeah
14379680	14387280	I don't really know what to do because I basically pass out after stream, but I don't go full for a full eight hour sleep
14388560	14391440	So the only option I have really is to
14392000	14392720	um
14392720	14395280	drug myself up to force myself to sleep, but
14396480	14402560	I've done it a few times now and I keep waking up completely messed up and I don't do the full eight hour sleep
14402560	14404560	I
14404640	14409600	Can consume cannabis is it a plant? She's one. I think it's a plant. I don't know what plant though
14410480	14412480	She's wanting me to look at
14414080	14416960	Right you got so many plants in this apartment you can down
14418880	14421280	We'll go let me check one more time with the item looks like
14424080	14426080	What even is that?
14427440	14430240	A seriously is there a plant up here that looks like that?
14433280	14434560	I
14434560	14436560	Don't know what the item is
14437520	14442480	Well, that doesn't sound sustainable. Yeah, the space you're right yourself. Just sleep normally. I can't know that's the problem
14444080	14446320	I pass out four hours before stream
14447840	14454800	And I pass out four like four hours after I've already inspected you right the heck is this bizarre item
14455040	14457040	It's not in the kitchen is it?
14459360	14461360	Is up here maybe on the shelf
14463280	14468080	But it's a nice level lamp though. I have no idea what this is like was misread and sorry
14468160	14470960	I was also writing this message. It reads nightclub. Oh
14477520	14479520	What
14479520	14483120	Show me the image. No, it's gone. What?
14484480	14486480	It looked nothing like that
14488320	14490560	Nothing like I don't know what that was
14492960	14499120	Um, you sleep four hours and four hours just sleep eight hours straight and you're fine. No, the problem is I wake up
14499760	14501760	I don't want to get in trouble
14501760	14505440	I I can't sleep for eight hours is the problem
14506640	14511040	I could do the only time I get a deep sleep is right before stream and
14511600	14513760	Uh, obviously I have to wake up for stream
14514480	14516480	so I don't have like any
14517440	14519440	Solution to my problem
14520080	14522080	Because I need to be meman
14522560	14524560	I
14526080	14528080	Wait, how did I get over here?
14528720	14534480	Um, like obviously it's probably like oh just skip the nap. What? How did I get here? I don't
14536560	14538560	Oh, it must have been the wall
14538720	14543600	Take a day of rest without streaming. No, this sounds terrible. I know for a fact
14543680	14546400	I'll be so mad at myself for not streaming
14546960	14552240	That I would be so upset that I wouldn't actually sleep
14552720	14554720	And then that would annoy me twice as much
14556080	14559200	Um, that would send me into a fit of rage
14559760	14561760	Right, how did I get here? Was it you?
14562160	14563680	Whoa
14563680	14565680	Okay, he's patrolling. It's fine
14568240	14573840	Uh, are you sleeping then waking up looking at your phone? No, um, I spoke to my doctor about it
14575120	14578880	Um, actually a while ago now, um, and um
14579680	14583600	I don't like bring my phone into the bedroom. That's like a big no-no
14584640	14589840	I'm allowed to rot in bed like on tiktok or whatever, but I don't bring my uh phone into the
14591120	14593120	Bedroom because uh
14593200	14595200	it mentalates
14595200	14600480	The nightclub the nightclub all the bones through that was freaking hating on me. Yeah. Well now it's my turn

14618800	14620800	Sorry, sorry, I'm not supposed to do that
14621120	14625600	I don't think the bouncer's gonna listen. Hey guys, I think we're gonna have to claim at the back
14628960	14630960	This
14630960	14634080	I do have maybe you could have some days with a gorilla stream instead
14635280	14637280	um
14641600	14643600	Oh, that's the window I can go inside
14645200	14647360	Are they talking? How did I get across to you?
14652800	14660160	As long as long term if you collapse with burner and I don't get burner like that I just get like can't sleep
14660240	14662880	Oh my god, you're so happy. Can I talk to you?
14664800	14668960	Oh, that's a shame. I can't talk to him. Oh as long as you're happy doing your thing

14705120	14709600	I've never been to like a rave or a party is this what it's like
14710720	14712640	Oh
14712640	14716240	Hey, wait, there must be like a private room that claims them like back here. Maybe
14718080	14722480	Clam wouldn't be in the middle of the floor, right? Surely not. She's literally a bit
14725120	14732640	Just sleep well on stream I far in my sleep. I honestly would if I could buy freaking far. Where the frick is claim? Am I going crazy?
14735840	14737840	Hey

14754880	14756880	Who wants to talk to hi
14760720	14766400	The access some private business going on it has been reserved for some blazer guy. Yeah, where is it?

14794080	14796080	Oh
14798960	14801200	Where there's wall here
14804480	14806480	God I suck at this
14808000	14811040	That looks like a walkway I'm supposed to get all the way around
14812160	14814160	How do I get up to it?
14816080	14818080	You see that you don't get rated on your birds
14819520	14821920	Once you open the floodgate with a farce it's over
14822480	14825760	You can never unfar again on stream
14828160	14830160	Wait, maybe that was the right way to go
14831600	14837360	Oh, it's it. There's not glass. I thought there was glass. Okay. Wait, so how'd I go up?
14839440	14841440	Okay, this has to be it
14848240	14850240	Um
14852400	14854400	So
14862640	14869840	Well, I uh, I think my dad's gonna keep me awake so I don't nap after stream basically because you'll be wanting to like go
14871200	14874560	And do stuff where the I'm genuinely stuck though
14875280	14878400	Can I like climb this wall with my claws or something?
14878640	14886720	I'm really turned around in this location. I see I see ladders, but
14888400	14890400	Oh for goodness
14895200	14899280	Use a lever do you guys have a lever here?
14901600	14904160	This is why so I can like interact with it
14905120	14912880	Hey everyone DJ Matty here, let's get the party started. Of course someone's been requested by a very questionable friend blazer
14916080	14918080	I need a record
14922880	14925120	Oh for goodness sake was it that simple?
14925600	14927600	Oh
14931760	14934320	Okay, it was that simple I'm so sorry
14936640	14938640	In my defense, I'm not smart
14943360	14945360	Wait
14950160	14954560	I need to do it on that side and I need a lever for it
14955280	14958480	There's nothing up here
14969520	14975040	Oh take the thing okay when the other guy goes what take his record
14977600	14979600	Okay, okay, okay
14980240	14983760	Surely that's what I'm supposed to do. I don't know why I'm supposed to do that
14985120	14987120	I
14988560	14993120	Right, I need to wait until he's not doing it and then yonkers record
15000080	15002080	He squashed him
15011520	15013360	Terrible
15013360	15015680	Can you snatch the plate? That's what I thought but
15016880	15018880	He's not coming over
15019360	15022240	This guy needs to come over and so I can steal the plate I think
15024080	15029600	You probably have to do that on both sides to take it. This doesn't even have a lever right? I need to find a lever then
15032320	15036880	Oh, where do I find a lever? Do you have a lever for me?
15038240	15040240	No
15044080	15046080	Whoa
15053040	15056640	What how is anyone supposed to know?
15058160	15060160	Okay, remember
15060800	15063280	Oh, there's no progress down here. It's just a memory thing
15065600	15069360	When I was human my friends and I would gather and party long into the night
15069360	15072720	Even if we had to suffer the annoying consequences the next day
15073200	15080480	It felt good to find joy despite the unaliveable surface and of a ruddery and the underground living conditions became more and more
15081040	15082080	squalid
15082080	15085280	And the capitalist greed of the companies like
15087600	15093280	And the police state created by the sentinels now I remember why we're doing that
15095200	15097200	Oh
15100320	15102320	Okay, so there's nothing
15102720	15104720	Wait
15104960	15108400	Let me in the vip right now. I'm on the other side of the door. Let me in
15109600	15111600	When I was human
15112320	15113760	Yeah
15113760	15119840	Everyone's been turned in my theory is that everyone's a human entire robot
15119920	15123440	But they forgot or maybe it was taken away by the state
15123520	15127040	So the people wouldn't revolt and accept that the surface isn't livable
15127360	15130800	Because obviously everyone's a robot now. So of course the surface is livable
15133600	15138640	Down with black rock. No, no, no, no, no the sentence is the high table
15141280	15143280	Down with the high table
15145920	15151040	Tin foil man, right where the thick is this lever take strange drink
15152960	15154960	I'm too alcohol someone
15157680	15161760	Why would I take a strange drink who would want a strange drink?
15165920	15167920	You
15172800	15177040	Who would want a strange drink the wink
15180160	15182160	Am I getting you drunk
15182320	15184320	I
15184720	15186720	Want to see you destroy that dance floor
15189840	15192720	Who wants a strange drink? Do you want a strange drink?
15194400	15199440	This club sucks when I tried to get that stupid VIP room. Can you believe it? I just stole this lever
15200480	15202480	If you give me a drink, I'll give you this off
15204080	15207520	Oh, thanks. Here you go as prom. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, give me that
15208960	15210960	Okay, we got there in the end
15211600	15213600	Doing it backwards as always
15214320	15218640	Okay, and then jump up on top of this one and then we can get away with it
15220320	15222320	Yeah, it wraps around
15228240	15231120	Oh, wait, should I do that music thing? Okay, hold on. Let me do the music
15234720	15238160	I think it must be achievement like make the club silent is my guess

15263600	15268880	I'm wondering if I'm supposed to bring in a second record and it like enhances and like everyone dances a bit more I guess
15270560	15274640	Is my gander at what is supposed to occur here? Please put me upstairs

16090340	16092660	Yeah, yeah, yeah, you need to help me progress

16105780	16107780	Can you give me a lift up?
16110180	16114980	I can't reach you'll have to lift me please. Yes. Yes. Yes. Just like that
16117540	16120020	I'll be a second hang in there
16121780	16124580	Uh, okay, it's just a lever. There's nothing scary here
16124900	16131220	Climb spray base we're not, uh, leaving him behind
16132980	16134980	B12 gang
16135540	16137940	And I'm getting every comfort in my chair
16138900	16141940	The sentinels are broken the way again. They will spot me instantly
16141940	16146020	Maybe you can try and bait them into those cells and lock them. Oh, no
16147300	16149300	What do you mean bait them into the cells?
16155300	16157300	Only see one
16161140	16163140	Just him you want
16167620	16169620	Just one
16177860	16183300	I didn't know they freaking show at me. Holy crap close it close it
16185540	16189060	What's around? Oh my gosh
16192100	16194260	That really went for me. Are you okay?

16198980	16201060	Wait claims you can't talk all
16205620	16212020	We're cat gaming today we pooding any putters you're my little pooders
16212980	16214980	One second
16220180	16225140	This per fellow seems like sentinels are ruthless when it comes to defying them
16227540	16233380	That's what I feared they have completely erased him no more emotions no more self-awareness no more memories
16233940	16236580	Please let's not get caught. No we won't
16237060	16241060	All right, what's the deal climb?
16256740	16258740	I need a lock of them inside here
16263620	16265620	Would it be better
16267300	16269300	I need to attract them both
16270420	16272420	I'm gonna lock it behind me
16277540	16284660	Wait, I'm an idiot. Oh sugar only one came in that's not what we want
16288580	16292500	Is it gonna push against the other door if it pushes against the other door
16293620	16295220	No
16295300	16297300	It patrols inside the dang cell
16299060	16301620	Unfortunate I messed that sequence up. Um
16306980	16308980	Right, okay, let it out and then do a little
16314420	16316820	Wait, was that registering it was inside? Whoa
16321540	16323540	One shot
16326180	16328180	Seriously
16328340	16330340	One shot
16330660	16332660	I fucking give me a fighting chance
16333140	16339300	I was gonna praise this game, but I kind of be honest with one shot death type stuff. That's ridiculous
16341540	16346740	Literally one shot. I mean I get there has to be like an anti like oh this game this game
16347300	16351860	It needs to have like it can't just be like super duper easy and all that but one freaking shot
16351860	16353860	Like me
16354260	16356260	I'm freaking gonna say I don't know if I did that in time
16358980	16360980	Again
16364740	16366740	So how do I get you in?
16367940	16370020	Yeah, don't shoot me again, I guess
16372740	16376500	And come inside I guess uh, this is not gonna work
16377460	16379460	I did it work
16380100	16385060	Oh, thank god. Yeah, the game was nice. That should not have worked, but whatever. I'll take that
16385860	16391700	You're a house cat. You're not built for durability. I know I'm a tiny cat, but brav. Give me a something to breathe like a lamb
16393700	16395860	Hi, you want to come escape?
16399700	16401700	Oh no, they took their brains
16406500	16408500	I
16413220	16418260	Juked him like a pro honestly, I was like, bro. I'm dying again. I'm gonna start region. Okay. Maybe I take it back
16418340	16420740	I was a bit heasty. Okay. I was a bit heasty
16421700	16423380	um

16584820	16586820	You're not coming
16588420	16592100	Okay, there's no way we'll we'll make it out of the sentinels on our tail
16592100	16597140	I can distract them for a little but you have to go the outsider manifesto says we must go outside at any cost
16597220	16598420	I wrote that
16598420	16600420	Oh, that's so
16601140	16604740	You're one of us now. It's not that everyone has to get the outside
16604740	16610900	But one of us has to you've gained an item subway key now go. I'll keep you in my ram little outsider
16613620	16616020	Climb run yes drive away
16617620	16619620	That's so funny
16620420	16622420	Okay, come on you and your mechanic mess up now
16624260	16627300	Oh, our friend was here. Oh, no the hippies gone
16628260	16629460	And
16629460	16631460	Now that is a death
16631460	16633460	Flag if I've ever seen one
16633780	16638580	I fear you might be correct my dear rifling. I fear you might be correct indeed
16640820	16645620	Okay, we've got a subway key now. We're unironically about to drive a train
16647460	16649860	We don't put it in this box
16651060	16653060	No
16654260	16656260	Sorry one moment
16656820	16658820	Is it this side we drive? No
16662100	16664100	Um
16664340	16666340	I'm sure we got given a subway key
16667460	16671780	If the death is not on the screen, it doesn't count exactly John Wick 4 momentum
16674260	16677300	I read an interview by Keanu Reeves because I was so upset
16677780	16683140	And if he apparently begged the directors to make it obvious he had perished
16683780	16685780	and I was like
16686260	16689860	Because he didn't want any of our arbitrary ending
16691300	16693060	Um
16693060	16696820	So I guess the scene of him falling down the stairs was it
16699860	16701860	I think I'm maybe going back
16704980	16706980	Or not at all
16708900	16714900	Boo oh neko like no eco not neko
16716820	16722500	We're actually going to be a train conductor stop. I'm pretty sure there's a train conductor neko in some
16723220	16725700	touristic railway station in japan
16728340	16732820	The music's gone all funky. I like your funky beat logo
16739780	16742980	Uh, but he's coming back for John Wick 5. Yeah
16743700	16745700	Oh
16748740	16750740	Train conductor for gen 2 confirmed
16752340	16754340	Can I make a sec?
16756820	16758820	Show me you take it
16761780	16763780	Here's that paper
16765620	16767620	We already have a train conductor in gen
16768020	16770420	Is that an ac joke omega alone?
16771300	16776340	The control room the headquarters you say
16779380	16781380	Do you have a ticket to this
16783300	16786900	Just stick people love tree what type of train would I design?
16791380	16794180	The steam train the scottish stream
16794180	16796180	The steam train
16798980	16801480	Well this place hasn't been touched by time
16807700	16809700	Hello
16811860	16813860	Hello
16814980	16816980	Hello
16817300	16819300	Oh
16820820	16827540	They don't have personalities that on the surface enjoy the world's safest city waltz city 99
16830820	16832820	There's no robots
16835140	16837140	Uh
16840580	16842580	Waltz city 99
16843300	16848020	Things are out of order though. There's no humans here
16851220	16853220	But the robots haven't evolved
16854740	16859780	City sealed rules of confinement heavy prison sentence
16861860	16863860	City sealed
16865060	16867060	Wow
16867460	16874740	Greetings inhabitant of waltz city 99 the door leading to the surface is currently locked due to a confinement procedure
16875220	16881300	Please refer to any certified engineer inside the control room if you have any requests. Have a nice day
16882420	16884900	It's weird when they don't have a personality
16885860	16887860	They're just
16887860	16889860	Robots
16890580	16892580	Okay
16893380	16895780	Wow, this is weird
16900740	16903380	The control room is closed by some sort of security protocol
16903380	16908980	It says that only humans are authorized also says that i'm not considered human. Hey, that's offensive security protocol
16909540	16912820	Maybe if we work together we can open this passage way
16915780	16917780	Um the control
16917780	16919780	It says why
16920100	16926180	I'm pressing why but it's not doing it. I need to drag something over. Oh, yes. Yeah, I do. I remember this
16928500	16930900	Let's stand on it and see what we can do about this panel
16932660	16937220	Um, can we expect some gender bender and models females? No, I'm not like this
16939460	16941460	Oh
16941460	16943460	Okay
16943460	16945620	Yes, good little spreadsheet. Whoa
16945620	16947620	Oh, it's like
16947780	16949780	I can't scratch it off or open
16953060	16955060	Hmm
16955540	16957540	I need to throw something at it
16958660	16962980	Yeah, there's no gender bender of concepts that are already pre-established like
16965140	16970180	All the designs that have been approved so far like unique concepts. How do I open that panel?
16971140	16973620	Yeah, can I borrow your tool, please?
16976500	16981460	The savings you'll please refer to any certified engineer. Have a nice day. Thank you
16983220	16985220	Do you have a tool that I can borrow?
16996900	17001460	We started down there that was midtown and there we're up here
17001860	17003860	And
17005540	17007540	John makes and create with her coffee right
17008180	17015140	No, I was very surprised about the new gen two entry. Um, it completely knocked out a previous except the design
17015220	17021460	So that was a very I was very surprised. Um, because I had actually enjoyed the
17026420	17028420	Open human
17031620	17033620	I'm not sure what I'm missing
17034740	17037140	Oh, you know what you're actually done
17039060	17042740	Oh, yeah, that's right. A little cheeky like cold
17044100	17046100	Is it sabotaging?
17047140	17049140	Okay, this is my
17050660	17054100	Does I need to bring the thing over again? No, it's open
17054900	17056900	I
17059940	17066340	Chant to go to eat us through the high table. Oh, you've guessed the pot. How do you this is the control room for the entire city
17066340	17068580	They controlled everything from here and it's empty
17071540	17076340	I remember hating them so much. They had everything clean space limitless power freedom to move
17076980	17078980	Little good. It did them
17080500	17082500	The plague I remember now
17084980	17090260	Everyone was dying and they thought they were above it all they did nothing to help us
17091380	17096580	I watched my family die. I felt helpless. I couldn't do anything to save them
17099140	17102820	But I can still help you we can still go outside together
17103380	17106660	I will carry the memories of humanity and the people I loved
17106900	17108900	Oh
17112340	17119780	I think we did it anyway, I don't know. This seems pretty end gamey to me not to be dramatic or anything, but I think
17123780	17125780	That's it. That's the main computer
17126660	17128660	I
17132980	17135300	According to the mainframe no one has been here for years
17135620	17139700	The whole city is stuck in a lockdown cycle from long ago if we disable it
17139700	17143220	We should be able to leave we'll need to bring the rest of the systems online
17143860	17147620	These computer holds the data we need we need to turn them on
17148420	17153220	While you do that, I'll look for passwords and encrypted keys to get into that system got it
17154020	17156020	Yeah, understood
17156100	17158100	Okay, turn these on
17159380	17163140	I actually really like areas that don't have freaking anything. Oh
17167620	17170500	That's me turning it on by walking on the keyboard
17172100	17174100	Oh, I can turn the phone. Hell yeah
17175700	17177700	Oh, let me jump that
17178980	17180820	Okay
17180900	17184980	Let's go. Oh, I missed. Sorry. Hold on one moment, please
17188100	17190100	And then done
17192020	17197940	It worked good job my friend. I found it. I know how to open the city something's off here
17199620	17201620	Wait, maybe there's a way around it
17206580	17208580	Roof control stage
17211780	17216420	There that's the workstation to open the city, but there's several layers of security preventing us from using it
17216420	17218180	Okay, that's understandable
17218180	17223220	Now we need to do what we do best me. I'll hack the machines and you destroy some stuff. Yeah
17224740	17226740	Oh, we actually destroyed the high table
17229700	17231780	Oh, so you're hacking what am I doing?
17234500	17236500	This isn't destroying
17237460	17241460	Okay, hold on there's a symbol here
17246740	17248740	Oh

17291780	17294900	Okay, and then last but certainly not least
17295860	17299620	This one right here, which is connected to this
17301300	17303300	Open it up and then say this
17305700	17311620	Oh, it's so cute. Yeah, fuck it up. All that practice
17313220	17315220	Did I do it?

17320500	17328420	Did you take HP damage? Ouch

17376820	17378980	Rift control right go do your thing
17381860	17383860	Oh wait, there's
17384820	17386820	That's it. We're safe
17388180	17391780	Listen I have something to tell you I knew the power requires to disable the city
17392340	17397220	Control center would be immense more than the strong body could handle but never the security disabled
17397220	17401620	I can take control of the system and open the city overriding it would destroy my software
17409780	17413700	Um, I'm pretty sure the software is him
17417460	17420500	By made that choice when I hooked into the first computer
17423380	17426260	Is he gonna die I can't cry
17428180	17430340	I don't want to cry wait no
17431140	17433140	And the consequences it could bring
17434100	17436100	I'm sorry. We won't see that. It's like no
17439460	17443940	I thought I needed to carry on in the memories of humanity to hold on to the past but I
17444660	17448580	Can see a future in the companion than you here. Let me take that off
17451220	17456500	You are my friend my very bad. Oh, no, why why do they have to make it sad?

17746340	17749780	I think so, but I was very young so I didn't understand what was going on
17752820	17754820	Wow
17755060	17757060	Wasn't a model twitching
17758980	17761860	I look like it was the rooms a bit dark so it's probably why
17763780	17767700	He lives happily ever after anyway if there's a straight mean he's gonna have
17768100	17770420	To struggle for it. Don't cry. No, I'm like
17771380	17778180	Why I just wanted to be like one thing. I'm such a crybaby and everyone like literally can't can't beat the crybaby allegations
17778980	17782260	Well, that just thought I was supposed to be like this cool neko game
17784100	17791140	Um, well, you know you're mucking about and like a post-apocalyptic scenario and it's like oh by the way the person
17791620	17795540	That you started with oh the parish and I was like, oh, thanks for that
17795620	17800180	That's really gonna brighten up my day after that. No, seriously that I'm so happy
17800580	17803860	That the person who helped me through the entirety of the game
17804260	17810740	Who helped me translate and speak to all the robots and gave me all this advice and we discovered that was actually a human
17810900	17814660	And they were a scientist. Oh, no, that's lovely that they just perished right at the end
17814980	17820100	No, thanks for that really really cheered up my day really made my heart speed up. Okay. Yeah, like
17821460	17823460	Cute crying mummy cup
17825540	17830820	I don't need to beat the embrace the crybaby embrace that emotion. Honestly. Why?
17835060	17837060	Oh, can't he handle it
17839540	17843860	Oh, but we love her crybaby. Honestly, it's freaking terrible for it
17845540	17847540	So out of 10
17850420	17852420	Honestly, I have to admit
17852660	17858180	That was a very fair game in the gameplay
17859220	17861220	my only
17861220	17862740	thing is
17862740	17867380	Maybe give a directional point to where you're supposed to go
17868740	17870980	Then again, I can see the argument for being like
17871620	17876580	Look, we've given you signs of where the shops you need to go and I kept stumbling into the puzzle somehow
17878260	17881140	But I do it. I think at the start we took a lot of time
17883380	17886420	I can hear my fucking neighbour in the garden right now
17888260	17890260	I swear to god if he puts on that lawnmower
17891700	17894660	She's sobbing hard. No, I'm no I'm no sobbing. I'm all right
17895460	17899060	Um our little crybaby seaweed. Honestly
17900500	17904020	At least the cat survived. Oh, no, I wouldn't even touch the game
17904420	17910100	I'm sure if the cat perished in the game like everyone I would have heard about it and wouldn't even touch the damn thing
17910980	17912580	Um
17912580	17914980	Now you can't even parley vu with the robots. I know
17916820	17921540	Um, are they confirmed that there's a straight to in production? Hold on. Let me check
17928100	17929700	Straight
17929700	17932900	Let's see is straight to in production
17934500	17939700	Not like you see it in the dark straight who is not confirmed as of yet. Wow. I'm surprised
17940900	17944260	Sorry, I need to sync up my mouse, but I keep them up, don't I?
17946820	17952660	Strony has been keeping the sea salty because of these games. Honestly. I can't stop greeting
17954740	17960660	We say greeting in scots. So yeah, Strony that was four hours. So I guess five hours is to 100% the game
17961460	17965620	Yeah, I don't I mean, I don't really know what you'd get if you 100% assume just as memories
17966180	17973220	I think they're gonna do a different game in the same universe. It is still a pretty recent game. Is it? Oh, okay
17973460	17976660	I just remember when it came out. There was like a lot of hype about it
17977300	17979300	because like no one expected that
17980260	17981620	So
17981620	17983620	Yeah, we're learning
17984580	17986580	That was cute though. Um
17987380	17989380	We'll just say it was 10 out of 10
17989700	17998660	For me personally, no, however, I can definitely see this appealing to the masses and being very fair
17998900	18004420	Like I think gameplay wise I messed up twice in the entire thing
18004900	18009860	And if I knew what was coming up like once I learned what was coming up, I could avoid what happened. So
18010980	18012980	Yeah, I don't think it's a
18013460	18015460	a wee problem
18016420	18021620	Stray came out in 2020. Okay. No game games take like at least three years development at this point
18022900	18029620	And I think in 8.5 animation and music was good gameplay was simple, but good story was good
18031220	18033220	Story was great
18033780	18035060	um
18035060	18036740	Yeah, I think that was
18036740	18040020	I think it's definitely on the higher for me personally. It's not a 10 out of 10
18040100	18044180	However, I can completely see where it's a 10 out of 10 for other people like
18044740	18049780	Again fair gameplay wasn't asking me to do like a billion different things at one time
18050180	18056260	I'm sure maybe exploring for people that enjoy exploring, but I don't really enjoy talking to NPCs
18056660	18058660	um that much
18058660	18060660	um
18061140	18065780	I know some people enjoy the dilly dallying, but I don't know for that game
18065780	18069300	I was like, oh, let's go to the net like let's do the next mission. Let's do the next mission
18069300	18073540	Like let's not dilly dally and like stop to talk like I guess cameo is a good example of like
18073620	18077460	I did the whole campaign and I only talked to who I needed to to get my fruits on that
18078580	18084180	This is definitely one of those games of all time from what I've seen I would give an 8.5 and I don't see a need to play it
18084900	18088500	I personally wouldn't replay it, but it is a good game
18089940	18091940	The game is pretty lore heavy, is it?
18093060	18098180	I think maybe yeah, maybe if you solo explored and you know
18098820	18105540	Read everything there was to say and found all the wee secrets and memories and that maybe you know, it'd feel like a bit better
18107460	18112100	Yeah gameplay wise it isn't that appealing. Yeah, it's I would say it's relatively easy
18112100	18118580	Which I quite I'm enjoying an easy gaming experience these days. Like I'm really addicted to baltro
18118580	18124340	But it's so hard not to like slam it down every week. So I'm behaving. I promise there's no baltro for a couple of weeks
18124580	18129380	Um, I've really been enjoying stuff that doesn't require like insane reaction time
18130020	18135860	Because that's like where I get frustrated. I have to like replay the same mission over and over. I do wish we had our
18136740	18137620	aim
18137620	18144340	A cutscene where all the cats got together though. That's a bit annoying. I like understand the cats freeing back on the surface
18145300	18150420	But I wanted it to see its pals, you know, like is that is that too much to ask for chat noir?
18151060	18157220	In a two tail polka dot. Oh, I forgot his name and cally-cally clear. I think
18159780	18161780	Stray is one of those
18162180	18163380	huge
18163380	18170820	Intractable movie type games. I'm gonna not even pretend. I know what that word. We should have baltro Monday. Nah, I've got
18172020	18177220	I've planned a little bit ahead of what streams I'm doing when my dad gets here. Um
18177220	18185860	I've got an Orwell game. I'm not even kidding. It's like a 1984 game. I'm forcing you to play it with me
18185860	18188980	I don't care. I honestly don't care. I'm forcing you to play with me
18188980	18192820	And I'm sticking a tinfoil hat on me when we do the entire gameplay
18193220	18197220	I need to start using like vtuber assets like this more because the ears are so funny
18199460	18203220	Interactable, okay. Yeah, is that a retro game? No, it's like a
18204180	18206660	I don't know. You just like click through the text and stuff
18207300	18209300	I'll read it out though. Don't worry. I'll read it out
18210660	18216100	But yeah, that was good. I enjoyed that. I'm gonna is there any uh veal or girly pops on
18217460	18221060	Yeah, I mean the review said the game takes five hours. So
18222100	18225540	Uh, I really be stumbling very luckily into that stuff. Uh
18226820	18231300	Is there any veal or girls on that I can redirect into just the question
18231460	18237700	She be on Elden Ring. Let's effin go
18240340	18242500	Let's effin go
18242500	18247620	Elden Ring it is time. Rise do you turn is she playing at the proper way or is harem
18248180	18251540	Is harem coming into help her or is she doing it the proper way?
18252340	18257140	As the development team intended, what do you mean you don't play Elden Ring as a multiplayer experience?
18257220	18261220	What are you talking about? It's a perfect multiplayer experience
18262260	18268500	That yours are cute. Read them up it. Let us go. Oh, no, somebody save she be. She hasn't summoned anyone yet
18269300	18276500	Oh my god, she's so brave. I'm like as soon as as soon as I had access to the summoning circles. I was like
18279460	18281460	Come play with mome
18282660	18287540	Oh also, uh all my thumbnails are up like all my streams are up for this week
18288260	18293300	We are playing the jellybean game, which is called fall guys. So if you don't have fall guys
18293860	18298900	Installed please do it for me if you want to play with me. I'd like to play with you. That's okay
18299540	18303860	But I know some people don't like downloading the launcher because I think it's an EA game
18304100	18309460	And I'm sorry if you don't so it's okay if you don't want to download it and play with me because of the launcher because I know it's a
18310180	18312180	thing
18312180	18314180	A real pro gamer not like me
18314340	18315460	Yeah
18315460	18318980	Some girls just like being princess carried in games and some like a challenge
18319460	18324900	I think a lot of people will show you in that game. Yeah, but the reeflings get to touch me and get to jellybean pull on me
18324980	18328180	Not that I had to make a new epic account
18328820	18334020	Hackers tick my your epic freaking account. Wait. Did you spend money on it?
18334660	18337540	All downloaded and ready to go. I just don't like fall guys
18338660	18340900	We were playing other multi game experiences
18341860	18344100	We're actually going to be making puzzles together
18345060	18349380	In a week or so, but I'm going to hate what I'm going to make the image
18350660	18354020	And I'm going to make it really difficult and I'll see if we can do it
18357620	18359780	A bit those of us who have on steam
18360740	18364420	I think you can like play with me. No problem because I just give you the code
18365380	18368900	Who would hate the fortnite launcher? No, it's a fortnite. It's fall guy
18370980	18373620	No money, but I lost some of the free games I claimed. Um
18375300	18377300	Shocking
18377300	18380500	Puzzles with Johnny. Yeah, but I'm going to hide the screen
18380500	18385780	So you don't know what the puzzle is and then I'll give you the link and then we complete the artwork together
18388020	18389140	Um
18389140	18391300	I had to catch up on Isaac
18391300	18395300	So I'm ready for multiplayer when you said this game wants you to suffer. Yeah, you're right
18395300	18397780	I remember why I draw oh the game does not
18398180	18402100	Want you to win it is a punishing game. Um
18402900	18405780	Like I honestly enjoy just playing it casually
18405780	18409860	I've not actually hardcore tried to go for any unlocks in a very long time
18410100	18413620	I should have showed off my unlocks because I had a I've got two
18414900	18419460	Alternative characters that aren't unlocked on Isaac and I keep forgetting to get them
18420740	18424980	But yeah, the game does not like you like I'm pretty sure pretty much all my unlocks are like
18425060	18429380	I randomly stumbled upon an R key. Um, and then did what I needed to do
18430900	18436100	Um, but yeah, that was like a really good experience. Is this freaking shame that I cried honestly
18436100	18438580	I'm such a fucking crybaby. Can he stop it?
18439300	18444180	Um, but that was really good. Um as for what I'm going to do when I go off lane
18444900	18448180	I've got two more ASMR collab scripts to write and then I have
18448660	18455860	Officially like given everyone what they need to collab with what I would like them to give me for the collab and then
18457060	18461860	I'm going to take a break from doing asking people for ASMR collabs just for a teeny weeny bit
18462420	18465700	Um, and then I'm going to focus on my
18466500	18470020	sub scraper milestone. Thank you videos. Um
18471620	18477780	And also the meme videos we've actually got the pregnancy ASMR comment that sounds bizarre saying that in a sense
18477780	18482180	I've got the pregnancy ASMR coming up. I've got hypnotizes you to like, um
18483140	18489620	Pineapple on pizza. I hope you can sleep. Yes. Um, I get I'm probably gonna go for a nap
18489620	18494740	But it's it's the only way I seem to be able to sleep that minute is go lie down
18495780	18498260	And then when I wake up I do a big chunk of work
18498340	18503620	Like the girls all had shorts come out today if I'm not mistaken. I think the mercy might have had a short come out
18503620	18505620	Let me see one more check
18506020	18511860	Um, I ordered a four for a zero one of them, which is absolutely hilarious. I cannot wait for you guys to see it
18513220	18518340	Oh, no, the mercy one must come out tomorrow. So it's only a season one that came out. Um, I
18518900	18522260	gave any to she is gonna upload it when she wants to upload it
18522900	18524180	and
18524180	18529300	Yes, I've linked the ac short if you want to watch that literally it's in the the the chat
18529860	18534420	A right now at the top. It's a funny clip. I was absolutely hilarious
18534900	18540340	It might actually be the first a clip on the viewer like clip channel. Um
18541380	18545540	We're gonna very slowly start putting stuff up. Um
18549060	18554180	Sorry, I just opened up Marshmallow just to see if anyone said anything the first sentence I read
18554500	18558100	One of the reasons I love you so much is that you can't spell or read
18560260	18566820	Refling oh my god, you're not supposed to say that. I mean you can Amy has a new one with her rats
18567700	18572580	Oh, did she post it? Okay. Uh, I will link. Uh, I'm actually gonna link Emmys
18573620	18579540	Tomorrow's stream. I will pin Emmys. I've pinned acs today. I'll pin Emmys main. I'm not really that bothered about
18582500	18585140	Wait hypnosis about pineapple on pizza. I missed that
18586100	18590020	Um, when we were meme I was memeing with the reeflings like in another stream
18590500	18596260	And I think I was like, oh that would be a really funny meme video like someone said it and I was like, oh my god
18596820	18603060	What if I did it hypnotizes you to like pineapple on pizza ASMR because like obviously I like my meme and shitpost day one
18604740	18610580	Um, or a little illiterate little seaweed doesn't know our abc's or one two three's honestly. Um
18611540	18617860	What was the rest of that message though? I don't really know why but I can't stop myself from wanting to squeeze you tight in my embrace
18617860	18622500	And kiss you on the forehead when you spell something wrong, especially when you get flustered over at a dory
18622500	18625860	I always have. Oh, thank you reeflin. I'm glad it doesn't frustrate you
18626420	18631220	I feel like when people like see how I type it's like, oh my god, how does your mind work like that?
18631620	18636820	but like I don't I like trying not be mean to myself about it because
18637860	18639860	like I
18640180	18647940	I think it's like a good thing that I show like, oh, I don't know how to spell so I have to spell it phonetically in my head like I have to
18649300	18654260	Do things in my head like a bit different the way that like you might have been taught or you do otherwise
18654820	18656340	um
18656340	18661460	So yeah, I'm glad it doesn't frustrate you and you have the patience for how dumb dumb I am
18662980	18668100	More making hypnotizes for all four and all she likes but pineapple pizza is too far
18668180	18673220	Okay, dude. You're done. So what's the plan of attack tomorrow?
18674580	18676580	um
18678100	18680100	Uh

18698340	18701620	Um, sorry, I have snot in the back of my schnozer because I was crying
18702500	18706020	Um, and then I'm doing a membership ASMR. So yes, hopefully
