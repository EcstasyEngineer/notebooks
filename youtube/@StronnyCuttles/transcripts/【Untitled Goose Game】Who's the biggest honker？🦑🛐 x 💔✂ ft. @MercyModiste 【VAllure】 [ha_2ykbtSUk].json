problems on purpose i want to wear a beautiful ribbon i don't i assume i can put it on you essentially but i want a bizarre come here come here i can put it on you i thought i could put it on you oh i'm just doing it from you oh we're just passing it mouth to mouth excuse me oh we're just like here you go no you have it no you have it no you have it you hang up you hang up you hang up uh i don't know how to get her to break this um no she's always gonna have it she she goes to an idol meeting in the open literally how what maybe we go in another garden for now and get out of here wait we can't even get out until we progress through this stage our section there is a gate here hello mr gate that is not going to work we have this on you i don't know if you can i like the way we both look down at it really that's not the way it should be okay why can't i not put it on you oh oh oh you're so aggressive uh no i'm like trying so hard to put it on you right now it's not working oh wait wait wait oh maybe if i move the duck if we move the geese and you be the duck yeah and i'll be the i'll be it oh i like this idea and then i stand there and then she puts it on me unless she's gonna constantly put it okay right i'll let her pick that up and then i'm gonna yank this away no you don't care about this okay like it's hidden no oh i just clicked off again i can't stop doing that what no no no no no no no no no no grab the ribbon grab the ribbon i'm trying oh no you've got me lady wait does she know that's this she knew that's wait what how did she know that's not possible what is on me fine but the game literally says to put her there the table we broke something about the table we broke hold on what's up with the table can add a table now this one oh it's how we get out we go up the table now to go into another garden you want to move on to the next one we can come back to this plot plot we'll come back to to miss to the garden to miss as soon as we scare the mister we call her miss crack pot because we have to crack her pot wait literally hi do you have a cup of tea by any chance for us little geeseling we really like your lacrosse do you want to have some tea a bit of tea no no tea okay jeez that's hard to impress these people clearly wait hey does he have a does he have a set of tea maybe hello hello he doesn't he really looking at us like can i help you uh yeah actually you're a mission objective we're not doing we're not going to be promised i'm just i'm just crouching around in your garden i ain't doing nothing what we're doing we're watched through the fence he can't see us but we can see him perfect we're we're such we're such bad geese literally what is going on night wait why is he so what's the word he's so suspicious yeah he's paranoid he like can't even enjoy his tea come on oh oh oh okay rub in the yeah okay okay go go go go go go no you're supposed to spell it my good sir did i not give you a freighter in that right take a sip hey hey wait that wasn't what we wanted wait nothing marked we wanted him to spit out the tea so he has to drink the whole thing i think no steal his shoes don't have to tell me to it hi oh no i didn't mean to do that i meant steal your loafers sir yeah i'm sorry them loafers go sit down sir go sit down i want your shoes oh he didn't like that i like him he's totally like he's tolerating us but he's came to not uh what no oh no i missed my turn there can't get it no can you yeah out of bounds that's that's right you aren't coded to come over here only i'm coded to come over here but you know oh did he just boot me because i took us through you don't deserve it maybe use the big bell behind him oh that makes perfect sense actually to do the bell when he goes for a sip can we see him do a sip from that side one of us has to go on the other side i think i think we uh i think we both have to do it or else we can um hello i'm at a kakaya hello excuse me madame i need the bell i shoot madame i need the access to the bell you're in my way madame madame please refrain from getting in my way right oh sorry okay that's definitely what you're supposed to do when he sips his tea we just need to hang around while he does his wee tea okay we're getting there we just need our handheld through the game just a tiny bit okay just a tiny bit of hand holding right so we need to wait until the suspiciousness is come back he should he should drink his tea after he's done his like suspicious animation oh wait i'm trapped i'm trapped we're good i didn't this game is a lot harder than i thought i thought this was like a i say this about every game i play oh i thought this was a child's game why is it hard and i don't know if that's just a reflection on me but he's still no the bell thing needs to be set up again she's not fixing it oh no you're right oh sugar what is she trying to fix right now oh well okay um she's currently painting take the bow i didn't know i can take her paint and brush oh i can draw her paint and brush one or the other good night starting about wake up in four hours bro you're gonna be charred um no was that supposed to take the paint brush oh she's gonna fix the bell okay and then do you want to put the duck in the other garden i wonder if that's what it is you put the statue in the other garden so then she forgets she even had a duck no i must tell you okay there we go okay it's now out of bounds so she can't ask for the duck anymore it doesn't work like that and now we wait for him to drink his dang tea that must be frozen solid at this stage because there's no way please ask for tea are you coming in this garden your audio might be cutting it for me on discord a little bit oh sorry no that was all good the knee buddy so she knows it's fake right she tells you to move does that need to paint you so she's fixing that wait can i put the bow on you now because we got rid of the statue no i've done you didn't give me time right go paint right go paint geez let's do this bell for this poor man oh he's about to do his animation okay no he was supposed to do the drink tea animation why maybe this will help your mindset for the puzzle the game is meant a single player everything can be done solo you mean we could be doing this twice as fast but taking us three times as long hold on a minute what's going on here these allegations oh yes dumb because you're right i mean it's not wait water in this dish maybe i'm like trying to look around for hints but i'm like bro stand on the stand when she's not looking right if mersey's
