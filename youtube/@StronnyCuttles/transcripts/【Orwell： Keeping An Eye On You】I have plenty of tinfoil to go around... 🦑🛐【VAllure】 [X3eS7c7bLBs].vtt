00:00.000 --> 00:29.720
Good morning I guess you couldn't faint in foil

00:29.720 --> 00:34.720
I'll have PNG, the best I got is a JPEG.

00:37.240 --> 00:40.840
I'm fucking typed in 10-4, I'll have PNG.

00:40.840 --> 00:44.000
And again, none of them were PNGs.

00:45.280 --> 00:47.480
So I'm fucking have this on my head.

00:47.480 --> 00:50.080
Hold on, I need to re-calibrate.

00:52.280 --> 00:54.200
Okay, there we go, I re-calibrated.

00:54.200 --> 00:56.840
I'm freaking spinning off my head.

01:00.520 --> 01:03.120
Shit, I did not filter through transparent images.

01:03.120 --> 01:04.920
I absolutely did not.

01:04.920 --> 01:07.200
I think I got to the eighth one and I was like,

01:07.200 --> 01:08.640
you know what, I like this one

01:08.640 --> 01:13.240
because the top part, the top part of the tin foil.

01:13.240 --> 01:14.960
It looks so good.

01:14.960 --> 01:16.280
And I was like, I want this.

01:16.280 --> 01:19.640
So, I'll give myself the hiccups.

01:20.640 --> 01:23.120
Right, no hiccups, because it's gonna hurt.

01:24.360 --> 01:28.880
Okay, it's so funny considering the background, literally.

01:30.320 --> 01:31.600
Right, I don't want the hiccups

01:31.600 --> 01:33.120
because it's gonna really hurt.

01:34.200 --> 01:36.920
This too was a high-table plot, literally me.

01:36.920 --> 01:41.000
I don't know, I had a tin foil PNG like the other day.

01:41.000 --> 01:43.800
Levy Exodus, thank you for becoming a member.

01:43.800 --> 01:45.640
I appreciate it.

01:45.640 --> 01:47.720
What kind of membership streams do I make?

01:47.720 --> 01:49.760
In general, you're asking.

01:49.760 --> 01:53.200
I usually stream three to four membership streams a week.

01:53.200 --> 01:54.520
Are you squidding me right now?

01:54.520 --> 01:56.120
But I have to...

01:56.120 --> 01:58.000
Did some reeflings miss?

01:58.000 --> 01:59.680
You got some white in your hair.

01:59.680 --> 02:01.800
No, it's a PNG on purpose.

02:01.800 --> 02:03.440
It's not a PNG by accident.

02:03.440 --> 02:04.800
Are you squidding me right now?

02:04.800 --> 02:06.120
A JPEG on purpose.

02:08.240 --> 02:09.680
Mm!

02:09.680 --> 02:10.920
I'm gonna go, Brian doesn't read out,

02:10.920 --> 02:11.880
but I'll read out, don't worry.

02:11.880 --> 02:13.320
Spidey, thank you for the tip.

02:13.320 --> 02:14.160
I appreciate it.

02:14.160 --> 02:17.160
Good morning, good evening, good afternoon, reeflings.

02:17.160 --> 02:18.800
Akadea says,

02:19.640 --> 02:22.080
love, love, please take care of yourself.

02:22.080 --> 02:23.000
Greetings from Germany.

02:23.000 --> 02:25.440
Hello, Leute, DankeschÃ¶n.

02:26.400 --> 02:28.840
Bitte, for das,

02:28.840 --> 02:31.080
a membership einen Month.

02:31.080 --> 02:33.160
DankeschÃ¶n.

02:33.160 --> 02:34.640
It's the best I've got, I'm sorry.

02:34.640 --> 02:36.360
Any German people listening?

02:37.720 --> 02:39.720
I feel like the crying women mean,

02:39.720 --> 02:42.200
babe, just go to sleep, you don't need a streamer.

02:42.200 --> 02:43.520
I'm okay.

02:43.520 --> 02:47.200
So basically, I'm gonna do a little yapping,

02:47.200 --> 02:52.000
but thank you so much to everyone who has reached out.

02:52.120 --> 02:55.600
Management basically got like,

02:55.600 --> 02:59.360
six more clippers on board, which is perfect.

03:00.360 --> 03:03.440
So I was up, kinda organizing a lot of clipping stuff.

03:03.440 --> 03:05.760
I was doing a lot of liaison stuff.

03:06.800 --> 03:08.840
Back and forth.

03:08.840 --> 03:11.080
If you didn't know, the girls have got

03:11.080 --> 03:12.680
GamerSupps codes.

03:12.680 --> 03:16.640
Everyone's descriptions are getting updated incredibly shortly,

03:16.640 --> 03:21.640
but you can just use the girls' names, GamerSupps.

03:21.640 --> 03:24.880
For 10% off and any earnings fully,

03:24.880 --> 03:27.600
go to the girl, Vehler, do not take a cut.

03:27.600 --> 03:30.400
No, no, no, no, Vehler, don't touch none of that.

03:30.400 --> 03:32.120
All profits, all for them.

03:34.160 --> 03:36.960
There will be a few tweets coming out

03:36.960 --> 03:38.880
that the girls will interact with,

03:38.880 --> 03:40.600
just to really solidify.

03:41.880 --> 03:46.920
And then, yeah, I do apologize for yawning.

03:46.920 --> 03:49.360
Vehler, GamerSupps, yes.

03:49.400 --> 03:51.560
I did not yet ask permission,

03:51.560 --> 03:54.840
if I'm allowed to talk about certain things yet,

03:54.840 --> 03:55.800
so you're gonna have to forgive me,

03:55.800 --> 03:57.760
but I can talk about something further

03:57.760 --> 03:59.520
if I am giving it all clear.

04:01.120 --> 04:06.120
Same applies to you, yes, CodeStrony at checkout.

04:07.360 --> 04:11.600
Gives you 10% off and it gives me a kickback.

04:11.600 --> 04:14.400
And I believe I'm gonna get a PR package,

04:14.400 --> 04:18.560
so you might get a hand cam stream of me snorting it.

04:18.560 --> 04:21.720
That's terrible, do not, no, I'm not actually.

04:22.720 --> 04:24.320
GamerSupps already is huge.

04:24.320 --> 04:26.360
Yes, they were incredibly kind.

04:28.760 --> 04:32.360
I can talk a bit more once I get the green light

04:32.360 --> 04:36.240
about a certain thing I would like to attempt,

04:36.240 --> 04:37.720
but can't do that yet.

04:37.720 --> 04:39.680
Time to get your anime thighs

04:39.680 --> 04:41.840
or teddy milk sponsored by Vehler.

04:43.640 --> 04:47.840
Well, there's a new flavor coming out on GamerSupps.

04:47.840 --> 04:52.520
It might already be out and it's called anime thighs

04:52.520 --> 04:55.760
and you might recognize someone's thighs on it.

04:55.760 --> 04:59.360
It's not my thighs, no, someone else's thighs.

04:59.360 --> 05:04.360
So, you know, if you were curious,

05:05.840 --> 05:08.280
you might recognize someone's thighs on the packaging.

05:08.280 --> 05:12.200
If it's already out, if it's not out, do not listen to me.

05:13.480 --> 05:14.400
I think it's already out

05:14.400 --> 05:17.160
because they gave us promotional artwork for it.

05:17.200 --> 05:21.360
It's not Warmelon, no, it's not me, it's not my thighs.

05:21.360 --> 05:23.960
Someone else's thighs of Vehler.

05:23.960 --> 05:25.280
Peeler flavor when?

05:25.280 --> 05:26.120
It's orange.

05:29.360 --> 05:32.240
But yes, I do apologize if I'm a little sleepyhead today.

05:32.240 --> 05:37.240
So, I just wanna say, if any of you make War Thunder videos,

05:38.480 --> 05:42.440
my dad was watching you bomb things in War Thunder.

05:43.320 --> 05:45.680
Pearly, thank you for the five gifted members

05:45.680 --> 05:48.440
and congrats to those who cut them with their face.

05:48.440 --> 05:51.400
I apologize for her squint, my hat,

05:51.400 --> 05:54.680
my little tinfoil hat is horizontal.

05:54.680 --> 05:57.920
That thing is spinning on an axis, that's terrible.

05:59.800 --> 06:03.600
Yeah, he was watching War Thunder videos.

06:03.600 --> 06:05.280
So, if you make War Thunder videos,

06:05.280 --> 06:07.440
there's a chance my dad watched you.

06:07.440 --> 06:11.400
We were also watching Australian car crashes,

06:12.240 --> 06:17.240
and compilations, War Hammer, War Thunder.

06:18.400 --> 06:22.760
War Thunder with the planes, my dad has planes.

06:24.000 --> 06:25.200
He loves planes.

06:26.720 --> 06:29.800
War Thunder leaked more documents again.

06:29.800 --> 06:31.760
Honestly, that's hilarious.

06:31.760 --> 06:35.520
It's actually my dad's, sorry, sorry, my dad's at it again.

06:35.520 --> 06:38.360
I apologize, he just gets a bit overzealous

06:38.360 --> 06:40.680
about the details on the planes and stuff.

06:40.680 --> 06:43.280
You know, they have to be right, they have to be accurate.

06:46.160 --> 06:50.000
And is he into the War Thunder Kiss Me loop?

06:50.000 --> 06:53.560
No, he's into the let's test out nuclear bombs

06:53.560 --> 06:55.840
and what happens when we drop them loop.

06:56.720 --> 06:58.680
We were literally watching nuclear bombs

06:58.680 --> 07:01.760
get dropped in the game, and I was like, oh yeah, curious.

07:03.480 --> 07:06.640
And like honestly, the stuff my dad watches is hilarious.

07:06.640 --> 07:08.800
So one minute we're watching nuclear bombs,

07:08.800 --> 07:11.840
next minute we're watching car crash compilations

07:11.840 --> 07:15.480
from Australia, because everyone's like, oh, you effing suit.

07:15.480 --> 07:17.040
Like every time there's a crash.

07:17.040 --> 07:20.080
And then we jumped over to the chef, what's his name?

07:20.080 --> 07:23.600
The French Italian chef, it's like Jean Pierre or something.

07:23.600 --> 07:25.600
And he goes, onion.

07:25.600 --> 07:29.280
And we were like jumping between all these categories.

07:29.280 --> 07:32.160
It was, I was getting flat, like, not flashbacks.

07:32.160 --> 07:34.160
I was getting whipped around, honestly.

07:35.480 --> 07:37.400
10 file foil hat, absolutely.

07:37.520 --> 07:39.920
We're playing a game called Orwell.

07:39.920 --> 07:44.920
If you didn't know, 1984 is a book by George Orwell.

07:46.200 --> 07:50.760
And it's about how everything is in shambles, okay?

07:50.760 --> 07:52.880
And we're about to play a game based on it.

07:52.880 --> 07:55.320
Now, this is my only concern,

07:55.320 --> 07:59.080
because I have not slept properly, Jean Pierre.

07:59.080 --> 08:02.440
Ah, it's like a chef that's French and Italian.

08:03.440 --> 08:06.800
The surveillance state, basically.

08:08.800 --> 08:12.160
Because I've not slept, I don't know if my reading skills

08:12.160 --> 08:13.840
are gonna be down dramatically.

08:13.840 --> 08:16.160
Thank you again, Pearlie, for those gifted subs.

08:16.160 --> 08:17.800
I appreciate you.

08:21.400 --> 08:26.400
I actually need to check if I have any more emotes slots.

08:27.320 --> 08:29.400
I might actually have more unlocked.

08:30.400 --> 08:32.040
Just like real life.

08:32.040 --> 08:33.640
Exactly, Reefling.

08:33.640 --> 08:35.840
What's that about the high table?

08:35.840 --> 08:38.960
Sean, you're gonna be so cooked on this one, honestly.

08:38.960 --> 08:42.320
Right, so we're just gonna get into it.

08:42.320 --> 08:43.680
It's a bit of a reading simulator,

08:43.680 --> 08:45.200
but please don't worry, I'll read.

08:45.200 --> 08:47.160
Please do tell me if the music's too loud

08:47.160 --> 08:50.600
or anything over my life.

08:50.600 --> 08:53.480
Don't record yourself peeing literally in 1984.

08:53.480 --> 08:56.400
Okay, that's when you're allowed to be mad, so.

08:56.400 --> 08:58.400
We're just starting a fresh, clean game.

08:58.440 --> 08:59.440
We'll go from the start.

08:59.440 --> 09:00.960
Is this game about surveillance?

09:00.960 --> 09:02.880
That is, congratulations.

09:02.880 --> 09:05.360
You've been selected for the Orwell test base.

09:05.360 --> 09:07.560
Please create a profile, enter your name.

09:07.560 --> 09:11.080
Big G, E, you know what, I'll put Reefling.

09:13.440 --> 09:15.360
Reefling, next step.

09:15.360 --> 09:16.880
Please choose a profile picture.

09:16.880 --> 09:19.000
Reefling, what do you look like?

09:21.320 --> 09:23.160
I guess that guy.

09:24.360 --> 09:25.200
Are you old?

09:25.200 --> 09:26.480
No, that's an OG, son.

09:28.760 --> 09:31.200
Oh, this is like really weird.

09:32.640 --> 09:35.240
Yeah, I guess that's you, Reefling.

09:35.240 --> 09:36.080
Let's go.

09:41.600 --> 09:42.600
Is that a joke?

09:45.520 --> 09:46.920
Oh, it's not a joke.

09:46.920 --> 09:49.320
Okay, let's say, can I just play the game?

09:49.320 --> 09:53.280
Wait, oh, come on, that's a bit ironic.

09:53.280 --> 09:55.400
Okay, that one was a bit ironic.

09:55.400 --> 09:56.800
What the fuck was that?

09:57.800 --> 10:01.440
No, the neck bear reddit mod, the old lady.

10:01.440 --> 10:03.520
Shawnee, when do you have to make you do a sleep stream

10:03.520 --> 10:06.080
just so we could finally, oh, honestly.

10:06.080 --> 10:07.880
Please agree to the following terms.

10:07.880 --> 10:10.200
I am aware my actions will severely impact

10:10.200 --> 10:13.040
the lives of the citizens of the nation.

10:14.040 --> 10:17.120
I will work thoroughly and judge objectively

10:17.120 --> 10:19.600
to the best of my belief.

10:19.600 --> 10:22.160
While working, I will adhere to the law and jurisdiction.

10:22.160 --> 10:23.280
Yeah, sure, sure.

10:24.480 --> 10:25.320
Setting up pro.

10:26.800 --> 10:28.240
For ensuring the safety, thank you,

10:28.240 --> 10:31.000
for ensuring the safety of the nation's people.

10:31.000 --> 10:33.640
Your registration is now complete.

10:33.640 --> 10:35.120
Please wait, logging in.

10:39.000 --> 10:40.800
Freedom Plaza.

10:45.920 --> 10:48.360
I would do a sleep and stream, but afar in my sleep.

10:49.080 --> 10:53.360
Oh, my God, we're losing 1,000 social credit right now

10:53.360 --> 10:56.000
in China, for even acknowledging the system.

11:02.400 --> 11:06.520
Mummy, about to come to CIA, agent's best friend

11:06.520 --> 11:08.640
exposed to all our degeneracy.

11:12.080 --> 11:13.480
Enemy spotted.

11:13.480 --> 11:17.360
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

11:19.360 --> 11:20.920
Oh, OK.

11:26.880 --> 11:29.040
Oh, right, OK.

11:29.040 --> 11:30.040
On a bus?

11:32.240 --> 11:34.280
15 social credit purchasing,

11:34.280 --> 11:36.480
being chilling ice cream is not illegal.

11:37.680 --> 11:38.680
We're done for.

11:49.360 --> 11:53.360
I completely forgot how this game.

11:54.360 --> 11:56.360
I thought it was a text-based simulator.

11:56.360 --> 11:58.360
Whoa, that's bright.

11:58.360 --> 12:01.360
The clocks were striking 13.

12:01.360 --> 12:03.360
That's not possible.

12:04.360 --> 12:07.360
Eh, Symes, you're online.

12:07.360 --> 12:08.360
Good.

12:08.360 --> 12:09.360
Call me Symes.

12:09.360 --> 12:11.360
I'll be your advisor on Orwell.

12:11.360 --> 12:14.360
Together, we will form both the first and the last line

12:14.360 --> 12:16.360
of defence against terrorism.

12:16.360 --> 12:19.360
For the test phase, you are one of the first people

12:19.360 --> 12:24.360
to try out the Orwell system under real circumstances.

12:24.360 --> 12:25.360
Nothing happened.

12:25.360 --> 12:26.360
Everything's normal, citizens.

12:26.360 --> 12:27.360
Go back home.

12:28.360 --> 12:32.360
Selected from thousands of applicants from across the globe.

12:32.360 --> 12:35.360
Oh, and you picked me of all people with the tinfoil hat on.

12:35.360 --> 12:36.360
I bet you did.

12:36.360 --> 12:38.360
Normally, congratulations would be in order,

12:38.360 --> 12:40.360
but as you can see from that footage,

12:40.360 --> 12:42.360
there has been an incident.

12:42.360 --> 12:44.360
So let's get started.

12:46.360 --> 12:49.360
I've activated the reader tool for you.

12:49.360 --> 12:53.360
Its purpose is storing bookmarks to online websites

12:53.360 --> 12:55.360
and documents for easy access and to highlight

12:55.360 --> 12:57.360
when there is new info to be investigated.

12:57.360 --> 13:01.360
First, I want you to be informed of the situation.

13:01.360 --> 13:05.360
Our leading newspaper, The National Beholder,

13:05.360 --> 13:07.360
will bring you up to speed.

13:07.360 --> 13:10.360
HR a bit lacking to be fair.

13:10.360 --> 13:14.360
I feel like this game is about to have so many triggers.

13:15.360 --> 13:16.360
All right, headlines.

13:16.360 --> 13:18.360
Let's see what the headlines are loading.

13:18.360 --> 13:23.360
So, Bomba obliterates freedom memorial and kills three.

13:23.360 --> 13:25.360
Feel free to browse The National Beholder.

13:25.360 --> 13:30.360
I've activated the pro-filer.

13:30.360 --> 13:33.360
Open the unknown person's file case once you're done.

13:35.360 --> 13:38.360
Nations in tri-filth, what?

13:38.360 --> 13:40.360
Tri-filth failed?

13:41.360 --> 13:42.360
Pay par...

13:42.360 --> 13:44.360
Oh my God, I can't even read it all.

13:44.360 --> 13:46.360
Par-gay-cyan.

13:46.360 --> 13:48.360
Par-guess-ian.

13:48.360 --> 13:49.360
President.

13:49.360 --> 13:52.360
Aborts negotiations with opposition.

13:52.360 --> 13:56.360
Violent riots in tri-filth.

13:56.360 --> 13:58.360
Blaine encourages renewal.

13:58.360 --> 14:00.360
Jeez, Louise.

14:01.360 --> 14:02.360
Hey, Stormy.

14:02.360 --> 14:04.360
I'm just coming from Sheevee's Twitter space.

14:04.360 --> 14:05.360
It was really fun.

14:05.360 --> 14:06.360
She highly recommends it.

14:06.360 --> 14:07.360
What?

14:07.360 --> 14:08.360
I'm using it.

14:08.360 --> 14:10.360
Maybe shoot complete.

14:11.360 --> 14:12.360
So, what does it say?

14:12.360 --> 14:16.360
Proximately Wednesday evening, a device popped its clogs.

14:16.360 --> 14:20.360
According to the official police reports, three folk were killed

14:20.360 --> 14:24.360
and at least five bystanders were severely wounded.

14:24.360 --> 14:27.360
The freedom memorial was nearly completely destroyed.

14:27.360 --> 14:29.360
Police closed off the area.

14:29.360 --> 14:31.360
Prime Minister Blaine immediately issued a press statement

14:31.360 --> 14:33.360
and put the nation on high alert.

14:34.360 --> 14:38.360
Study with the future.

14:38.360 --> 14:40.360
She was using Twitter space to read miles.

14:40.360 --> 14:43.360
Parmesan President.

14:43.360 --> 14:45.360
President Cheese.

14:45.360 --> 14:46.360
Unknown person.

14:46.360 --> 14:47.360
Date birth address.

14:47.360 --> 14:48.360
Oh, okay.

14:48.360 --> 14:52.360
The profile holds all known information on those we investigate.

14:52.360 --> 14:54.360
The profile you've offered does our main suspect.

14:54.360 --> 14:58.360
The blue-haired woman that the CCTV footage shows before the assault

14:58.360 --> 15:00.360
is no stranger to the police.

15:00.360 --> 15:02.360
Take a look at their arrest record.

15:03.360 --> 15:06.360
Yes, I will take a look at the arrest record.

15:07.360 --> 15:08.360
Where is it?

15:08.360 --> 15:09.360
I'm clicking.

15:11.360 --> 15:12.360
I'm clicking.

15:12.360 --> 15:13.360
I don't want that to...

15:14.360 --> 15:15.360
Um...

15:16.360 --> 15:18.360
The arrest record.

15:18.360 --> 15:20.360
I know exactly where that is.

15:20.360 --> 15:21.360
Yes.

15:22.360 --> 15:23.360
Yep.

15:23.360 --> 15:24.360
Okay.

15:24.360 --> 15:25.360
Log out.

15:25.360 --> 15:26.360
Nope.

15:26.360 --> 15:27.360
Don't close.

15:27.360 --> 15:28.360
Right.

15:28.360 --> 15:29.360
Hold on.

15:29.360 --> 15:30.360
Hold on.

15:30.360 --> 15:31.360
Hold on.

15:31.360 --> 15:32.360
We're having a few issues.

15:32.360 --> 15:33.360
Okay.

15:33.360 --> 15:35.360
Watergate.

15:35.360 --> 15:37.360
Watergate Cassandra.

15:37.360 --> 15:41.360
The highlighted elements in the records are pieces of data that are able to be extracted.

15:41.360 --> 15:44.360
We call these elements data chunks.

15:44.360 --> 15:49.360
Hovering over data chunks will reveal their relevance to the case

15:49.360 --> 15:52.360
and any connections or information it may influence.

15:52.360 --> 15:56.360
Drop and drag all data chunks from the police database

15:56.360 --> 15:59.360
into a profile to upload them to our servers.

15:59.360 --> 16:02.360
So, Watergate Cassandra is a name.

16:02.360 --> 16:05.360
So, we upload her name.

16:06.360 --> 16:07.360
Yeah.

16:07.360 --> 16:08.360
Okay.

16:08.360 --> 16:09.360
So, her name's Cassandra.

16:09.360 --> 16:12.360
Arrest date doesn't...

16:12.360 --> 16:15.360
Suspect was arrested on site.

16:15.360 --> 16:17.360
I don't see any other data chunk.

16:17.360 --> 16:18.360
Oh, I guess her picture.

16:18.360 --> 16:19.360
Sorry.

16:19.360 --> 16:21.360
Of course, she has blue hair and pronouns.

16:21.360 --> 16:23.360
Wait, unironically does she?

16:23.360 --> 16:24.360
Very good.

16:24.360 --> 16:30.360
Enter the names or critical information for Orwell to study a person and identify.

16:30.360 --> 16:33.360
Information and documents can only become a data chunk

16:33.360 --> 16:36.360
when it is clearly been assigned to a targeted person.

16:36.360 --> 16:40.360
Add the reason for Miss Watergate's prior arrest has just been unlocked.

16:40.360 --> 16:42.360
We will need this info to progress.

16:42.360 --> 16:45.360
So, she did assault on a police officer.

16:45.360 --> 16:47.360
I came...

16:47.360 --> 16:49.360
Where is my complimentary FBI hat?

16:49.360 --> 16:50.360
No, no, no.

16:50.360 --> 16:51.360
We're tinfoil here.

16:51.360 --> 16:52.360
We're tinfoil gang.

16:52.360 --> 16:55.360
With the data you extracted from the police record,

16:55.360 --> 16:57.360
a new document can now be assessed.

16:57.360 --> 16:59.360
Now, let me ask you a question.

16:59.360 --> 17:02.360
Do you believe in coincidences?

17:02.360 --> 17:03.360
I do not.

17:03.360 --> 17:05.360
Find data revealing where she attacked the police officer

17:05.360 --> 17:07.360
and you will see what I mean.

17:07.360 --> 17:09.360
Okay, what?

17:11.360 --> 17:14.360
Suspect was arrested on site after Officer Franklin

17:14.360 --> 17:16.360
had been struck by an unknown object

17:16.360 --> 17:17.360
and became unresponsive.

17:17.360 --> 17:20.360
The protestor at the origin of the assault

17:20.360 --> 17:22.360
was forcefully removed with the suspect

17:22.360 --> 17:24.360
who saw kneeling and weeping on the ground.

17:24.360 --> 17:26.360
When asked to lay on the ground with her hands behind her back,

17:26.360 --> 17:28.360
the suspect cooperated immediately.

17:28.360 --> 17:31.360
Wait, so she paid attention right away?

17:31.360 --> 17:33.360
Why was she greeting?

17:34.360 --> 17:36.360
Coincidence, I think.

17:36.360 --> 17:38.360
No, yeah, why was she greeting?

17:40.360 --> 17:42.360
Guess what, I don't know.

17:43.360 --> 17:44.360
I'm not really sure.

17:44.360 --> 17:47.360
Is this woman a terrorist?

17:47.360 --> 17:50.360
Whoa, they're already printing it?

17:50.360 --> 17:52.360
Women allegedly injured a police officer

17:52.360 --> 17:54.360
two weeks ago remains in custody,

17:54.360 --> 17:56.360
trial scheduled for August.

17:56.360 --> 17:58.360
Wait, that's not possible.

17:58.360 --> 18:00.360
The incident occurred during a rampage

18:00.360 --> 18:02.360
at the Freedom Plaza as part of a demonstration,

18:02.360 --> 18:04.360
so it's the same location again.

18:06.360 --> 18:08.360
Freedom Plaza.

18:08.360 --> 18:10.360
The exact same location as the assault,

18:10.360 --> 18:13.360
then she turns up there right before the explosion,

18:13.360 --> 18:15.360
surely not a coinky dink.

18:15.360 --> 18:17.360
As you know, Miss Watergate's still running around freely.

18:17.360 --> 18:19.360
We should find out why.

18:19.360 --> 18:22.360
We should also gather more background information.

18:22.360 --> 18:24.360
I want to know who we're really dealing with.

18:26.360 --> 18:28.360
No, don't be sorry for being late, silly goers.

18:28.360 --> 18:30.360
You're not late at all.

18:30.360 --> 18:32.360
Who is an artist by profession.

18:32.360 --> 18:34.360
Okay, so we've got a job.

18:35.360 --> 18:37.360
Related document found.

18:37.360 --> 18:39.360
Oh yes, one who does street art

18:39.360 --> 18:43.360
by blowing memorials to pieces by any chance.

18:43.360 --> 18:45.360
Okay, so she did.

18:45.360 --> 18:47.360
Great, you've found another document.

18:47.360 --> 18:49.360
Before we go on, let's clarify your job.

18:49.360 --> 18:51.360
Again, we're just in the tutorial section,

18:51.360 --> 18:53.360
so don't be surprised there's a few pop-ups, okay?

18:53.360 --> 18:55.360
Great, you've found another document.

18:55.360 --> 18:56.360
Before we go on, let's clarify your job

18:56.360 --> 18:58.360
and how it affects mine, shall we?

18:58.360 --> 19:01.360
You have extracted all the info I already knew about her.

19:01.360 --> 19:04.360
Starting now, I'm going into it blind.

19:04.360 --> 19:07.360
The Orwell ethical codex dictates

19:07.360 --> 19:09.360
that investigators like yourself

19:09.360 --> 19:12.360
are the only ones allowed to access documents

19:12.360 --> 19:14.360
of targeted persons.

19:14.360 --> 19:17.360
Advisors like me only get to see the data

19:17.360 --> 19:19.360
provided by the investigators.

19:19.360 --> 19:22.360
We will then draw conclusions and request action.

19:22.360 --> 19:24.360
Your primary job is to provide information

19:24.360 --> 19:27.360
you deem important, never give away

19:27.360 --> 19:29.360
incorrect or misleading data.

19:31.360 --> 19:34.360
You may hit disable on a data chunk

19:34.360 --> 19:36.360
you do not want to pass on to Orwell.

19:36.360 --> 19:38.360
However, some data chunks might be necessary

19:38.360 --> 19:40.360
to progress on a case.

19:41.360 --> 19:42.360
Curious.

19:42.360 --> 19:46.360
So, we have the option to ignore

19:46.360 --> 19:50.360
something we don't like.

19:50.360 --> 19:52.360
So that's the exact same picture.

19:54.360 --> 19:56.360
Due to the chaotic nature,

19:56.360 --> 19:58.360
police have not yet been able to

19:58.360 --> 20:01.360
connect the crime by the artist,

20:01.360 --> 20:03.360
has denied the accusation completely

20:03.360 --> 20:05.360
and has asked their fans to show their support.

20:05.360 --> 20:07.360
A trial has now been scheduled for mid-August.

20:08.360 --> 20:12.360
Ooh, fancy.

20:13.360 --> 20:16.360
Cassandra's portfolio.

20:16.360 --> 20:18.360
Oh, I've got a new four-wall brochure.

20:19.360 --> 20:21.360
Shoving new four-wall on her.

20:21.360 --> 20:23.360
She's very smiley.

20:23.360 --> 20:24.360
Oh, just for play.

20:24.360 --> 20:25.360
Wait, you know what?

20:25.360 --> 20:27.360
Oh no, we've got multiple if we wanted this one.

20:28.360 --> 20:30.360
The accusatory.

20:30.360 --> 20:32.360
Hmm, something's not going on here.

20:32.360 --> 20:34.360
There's no such thing as a coincidence.

20:34.360 --> 20:36.360
It's been a hot minute since the last

20:36.360 --> 20:37.360
was this game.

20:37.360 --> 20:39.360
I wonder if you can frame people.

20:39.360 --> 20:40.360
Hi, I'm Cassandra.

20:40.360 --> 20:42.360
A colorful inhabitant of Wonderland

20:42.360 --> 20:44.360
right behind the rainbow.

20:44.360 --> 20:45.360
Bet you are.

20:45.360 --> 20:46.360
Glad you found me.

20:46.360 --> 20:48.360
Finally found the courage to quit my dull

20:48.360 --> 20:49.360
and focus on art career.

20:49.360 --> 20:51.360
So she's an artist.

20:54.360 --> 20:56.360
My U-Tail account.

20:56.360 --> 20:58.360
Well, that's her job,

20:58.360 --> 21:00.360
so I guess she can be an artist.

21:01.360 --> 21:02.360
Previously, Claire job.

21:02.360 --> 21:03.360
Yeah, that's fine.

21:03.360 --> 21:04.360
Hmm, interesting.

21:04.360 --> 21:06.360
Find out what job that was.

21:06.360 --> 21:09.360
And then my account name is this.

21:09.360 --> 21:11.360
Wonderlandster.

21:11.360 --> 21:13.360
She reminds me of Nikki from Honeycap.

21:13.360 --> 21:15.360
No, Nikki, but the bad end.

21:15.360 --> 21:16.360
Good, you found a chat handle.

21:16.360 --> 21:18.360
That will allow us to overhear any conversations

21:18.360 --> 21:19.360
on that account.

21:21.360 --> 21:23.360
How far fetched is this?

21:23.360 --> 21:25.360
Surely this doesn't occur in real life,

21:25.360 --> 21:27.360
and this is all fantasy based.

21:27.360 --> 21:29.360
Anyway, hydration check, briefly.

21:31.360 --> 21:33.360
The listener

21:33.360 --> 21:35.360
has now been unlocked.

21:35.360 --> 21:37.360
New conversations will appear

21:37.360 --> 21:39.360
whenever they are started.

21:39.360 --> 21:41.360
So we're going to listen in

21:41.360 --> 21:43.360
on a conversation.

21:43.360 --> 21:45.360
Oh, she's not online.

21:47.360 --> 21:49.360
Well, I guess, no.

21:49.360 --> 21:50.360
What's she got?

21:50.360 --> 21:51.360
She's got pudders.

21:51.360 --> 21:53.360
My beloved furball.

21:53.360 --> 21:55.360
Kikiko.

21:55.360 --> 21:57.360
Kikiko.

21:57.360 --> 21:59.360
Kikiko.

21:59.360 --> 22:00.360
Yep, the beaut is me.

22:00.360 --> 22:02.360
I was never sure about the title,

22:02.360 --> 22:04.360
Businessman's Forgotten Daughter.

22:04.360 --> 22:06.360
Daughter of an in-entrepreneur.

22:10.360 --> 22:12.360
Very...

22:12.360 --> 22:14.360
Oh, listener.

22:14.360 --> 22:16.360
Who's she talking to?

22:16.360 --> 22:18.360
Hey, you.

22:18.360 --> 22:20.360
Hey, Jossie.

22:20.360 --> 22:22.360
Dot, dot, dot.

22:22.360 --> 22:24.360
Oh, he's typing, sorry.

22:24.360 --> 22:26.360
I can't seem to find my credit card.

22:26.360 --> 22:28.360
I assume you took it right.

22:28.360 --> 22:30.360
You got me, Sherlock.

22:30.360 --> 22:32.360
Put the cat in the database.

22:34.360 --> 22:36.360
Oh, is this her man?

22:36.360 --> 22:38.360
I'm in the middle of buying all the Boston

22:38.360 --> 22:40.360
with that platinum card.

22:40.360 --> 22:41.360
I lifted.

22:41.360 --> 22:44.360
Stolen a credit card from an unknown person.

22:44.360 --> 22:46.360
I think that's her boo.

22:46.360 --> 22:48.360
I don't... I don't think we...

22:48.360 --> 22:49.360
We say that.

22:49.360 --> 22:50.360
We're lucky for you.

22:50.360 --> 22:52.360
I don't mind you going on a splurge

22:52.360 --> 22:54.360
as long as you pick up some wine for dinner.

22:54.360 --> 22:55.360
Yeah, they're mine.

22:55.360 --> 22:57.360
Wine, what does Yosef Langley,

22:57.360 --> 22:59.360
my fearless attorney,

23:00.360 --> 23:02.360
and all-round badass have...

23:03.360 --> 23:05.360
create new profiles?

23:05.360 --> 23:07.360
Sure, that's on him.

23:08.360 --> 23:09.360
Okay.

23:10.360 --> 23:12.360
You now have a profile and a related person.

23:12.360 --> 23:14.360
It could be access for you as a profiler.

23:14.360 --> 23:17.360
Date chunks will only appear for target persons.

23:17.360 --> 23:19.360
Okay, okay, that's fine, that's fine, that's fine though.

23:19.360 --> 23:21.360
Let's get back into her.

23:22.360 --> 23:24.360
Guess I better pick up tons of wine.

23:24.360 --> 23:26.360
You'll have to get this client of yours

23:26.360 --> 23:28.360
pretty buzzed to handle all that business.

23:28.360 --> 23:30.360
One bottle should be fine, she's a lightweight.

23:31.360 --> 23:33.360
Okay, I guess I shouldn't pick up some of those

23:33.360 --> 23:34.360
party pills from Big Pharma.

23:34.360 --> 23:35.360
Aki, my parent.

23:35.360 --> 23:36.360
Daughter of...

23:36.360 --> 23:37.360
Ooh!

23:38.360 --> 23:39.360
Wait.

23:39.360 --> 23:41.360
If you have Big Pharma parents,

23:41.360 --> 23:42.360
what the fuck is...

23:42.360 --> 23:44.360
Watergate Pharma, that does ring a bell.

23:44.360 --> 23:45.360
Ooh!

23:46.360 --> 23:47.360
Yeah, maybe.

23:47.360 --> 23:48.360
Gotta go now, text you later.

23:48.360 --> 23:49.360
Exo, exo!

23:50.360 --> 23:51.360
She's dating...

23:54.360 --> 23:56.360
A date from my darling.

23:56.360 --> 23:58.360
She's in a relationship, okay.

24:01.360 --> 24:03.360
Well, it was supposed to be...

24:03.360 --> 24:05.360
Okay, there we go, we've scraped this website,

24:05.360 --> 24:06.360
so we're gonna go back.

24:07.360 --> 24:08.360
Procedure...

24:08.360 --> 24:10.360
Closing raises...

24:10.360 --> 24:12.360
Manipulation speculation.

24:12.360 --> 24:13.360
Oh, that's her boo.

24:15.360 --> 24:17.360
Orwell informs me you just encountered

24:17.360 --> 24:19.360
conflicting data chunks.

24:19.360 --> 24:21.360
Whenever the content of two data chunks

24:21.360 --> 24:23.360
are odds with one another,

24:23.360 --> 24:25.360
they will be shown as a conflict.

24:26.360 --> 24:28.360
When you extract one of the data chunks,

24:28.360 --> 24:30.360
containing a conflict,

24:30.360 --> 24:33.360
the others will become invalid immediately.

24:33.360 --> 24:35.360
I'd highly recommend that you clarify

24:35.360 --> 24:37.360
in the context before you proceed.

24:37.360 --> 24:39.360
Though this is your decision,

24:39.360 --> 24:42.360
once information's been parsed,

24:42.360 --> 24:45.360
there is no way to reverse the choice.

24:45.360 --> 24:46.360
Okay.

24:46.360 --> 24:48.360
Are we ready?

24:48.360 --> 24:50.360
Oh, let's not fuck up.

24:50.360 --> 24:51.360
Am I in the way?

24:51.360 --> 24:52.360
I need to be smaller.

24:53.360 --> 24:55.360
I don't want to be too small.

24:55.360 --> 24:56.360
I don't know.

24:56.360 --> 24:59.360
I don't know if I made myself smaller or made it worse.

24:59.360 --> 25:00.360
Okay.

25:01.360 --> 25:03.360
The case that is almost the center media attention

25:03.360 --> 25:04.360
last month's come to an end.

25:04.360 --> 25:07.360
Cassandra was acquitted for allegedly assault

25:07.360 --> 25:09.360
with the case being closed due to lack of evidence.

25:09.360 --> 25:11.360
However, the case might be reopened

25:11.360 --> 25:13.360
with new evidence being discovered.

25:13.360 --> 25:15.360
The suspect's lawyer,

25:15.360 --> 25:18.360
at no point has there been any valid evidence

25:18.360 --> 25:19.360
that my client was guilty.

25:19.360 --> 25:20.360
No point at all.

25:21.360 --> 25:23.360
Meanwhile, the relatives of the victim

25:23.360 --> 25:25.360
expressed their disappointment on hearing

25:25.360 --> 25:27.360
the result of the lawsuit.

25:27.360 --> 25:29.360
They openly voiced concerns that

25:29.360 --> 25:31.360
the wealthy family of the accused

25:31.360 --> 25:35.360
might have influenced her favor.

25:35.360 --> 25:37.360
The victim, a father of two...

25:37.360 --> 25:39.360
Well, actually, I'm inclined to believe

25:39.360 --> 25:41.360
there was lack of evidence because she was

25:41.360 --> 25:43.360
beaten and she didn't resist the rest.

25:43.360 --> 25:47.360
So, I'm actually going to submit this one.

25:48.360 --> 25:50.360
But she was green.

25:50.360 --> 25:52.360
And she didn't resist.

25:52.360 --> 25:54.360
If you resist, then, yeah.

25:54.360 --> 25:55.360
This is what I figure.

25:55.360 --> 25:58.360
A pity that the CCTV did not actually help.

25:58.360 --> 26:00.360
Maybe it will today.

26:02.360 --> 26:04.360
So, how do I...

26:04.360 --> 26:06.360
add her re-boyfriend?

26:08.360 --> 26:09.360
You.

26:10.360 --> 26:12.360
Doesn't let me add his face?

26:12.360 --> 26:13.360
No?

26:13.360 --> 26:14.360
Okay.

26:14.360 --> 26:15.360
I don't undo that.

26:15.360 --> 26:16.360
Hold on.

26:16.360 --> 26:18.360
Right, back to her, back to her.

26:19.360 --> 26:20.360
You don't have to resist

26:20.360 --> 26:22.360
in your above-law correlation causation.

26:22.360 --> 26:23.360
Indeed.

26:23.360 --> 26:24.360
Why would someone...

26:24.360 --> 26:26.360
Why would someone, by their full name,

26:27.360 --> 26:28.360
one month member...

26:28.360 --> 26:29.360
What?

26:30.360 --> 26:32.360
What are you saying?

26:32.360 --> 26:34.360
Time to become big brother.

26:34.360 --> 26:36.360
Steady on, penthouse.

26:36.360 --> 26:37.360
Amy's back, don't worry.

26:37.360 --> 26:38.360
Right.

26:38.360 --> 26:39.360
What is this?

26:39.360 --> 26:41.360
Watergate pharmaceuticals.

26:41.360 --> 26:43.360
Let's just have a little...

26:43.360 --> 26:45.360
Ooh, lots of...

26:45.360 --> 26:47.360
Oh, that's what you use to regain your...

26:48.360 --> 26:50.360
See if your brain can put together

26:50.360 --> 26:52.360
what the joke I'm forming.

26:53.360 --> 26:55.360
Okay, let's check you out.

26:55.360 --> 26:56.360
The company.

26:57.360 --> 26:59.360
Ooh, is it her dad?

27:02.360 --> 27:03.360
No?

27:06.360 --> 27:09.360
That was before she got...

27:09.360 --> 27:12.360
No, no, she got blue hair to symbolize.

27:12.360 --> 27:13.360
She's radicalized.

27:13.360 --> 27:14.360
Get wrecked.

27:14.360 --> 27:16.360
That's hilarious.

27:16.360 --> 27:18.360
So, she was...

27:18.360 --> 27:20.360
Is that actually the same person?

27:20.360 --> 27:22.360
She got fucking radicalized

27:22.360 --> 27:24.360
and now she's blue.

27:25.360 --> 27:26.360
Okay.

27:27.360 --> 27:28.360
Well, she was the junior.

27:28.360 --> 27:29.360
She's giving it up.

27:29.360 --> 27:31.360
Right, her mom and dad.

27:34.360 --> 27:35.360
Her mom and dad.

27:35.360 --> 27:36.360
Okay, I see.

27:36.360 --> 27:38.360
Now, keeping it a family affair.

27:38.360 --> 27:39.360
So...

27:39.360 --> 27:40.360
Update.

27:40.360 --> 27:41.360
Junior...

27:41.360 --> 27:43.360
No, she left it.

27:43.360 --> 27:45.360
Documents that you already have reviewed

27:45.360 --> 27:47.360
maybe update from time to time as events unfold.

27:47.360 --> 27:49.360
The reader will notify you when that happens.

27:49.360 --> 27:51.360
The National Beholder just published

27:51.360 --> 27:52.360
a new article.

27:52.360 --> 27:54.360
You may want to take a look

27:54.360 --> 27:56.360
and see if there's any new information available.

27:56.360 --> 27:57.360
Curious.

27:58.360 --> 28:00.360
Is there anything else on the jobs?

28:00.360 --> 28:01.360
Can I get hired?

28:01.360 --> 28:02.360
Not...

28:02.360 --> 28:03.360
Not, you know, feeling it?

28:03.360 --> 28:04.360
Okay, fine.

28:05.360 --> 28:06.360
Fine, fine.

28:06.360 --> 28:09.360
So yeah, this is basically a click simulator,

28:09.360 --> 28:10.360
but yeah.

28:10.360 --> 28:12.360
Crane breaks continue to drop.

28:12.360 --> 28:13.360
The bomb.

28:14.360 --> 28:16.360
Wait, am I supposed to invest together?

28:17.360 --> 28:18.360
The safety bill.

28:18.360 --> 28:19.360
Go on then.

28:19.360 --> 28:20.360
What's the safety bill?

28:20.360 --> 28:21.360
I wanna know.

28:22.360 --> 28:23.360
What's the safety bill?

28:23.360 --> 28:24.360
Crimes pair.

28:25.360 --> 28:26.360
The safety bill is passed.

28:26.360 --> 28:28.360
The party is elected to government.

28:28.360 --> 28:29.360
Ooh.

28:30.360 --> 28:31.360
Nineteen.

28:31.360 --> 28:32.360
Eight.

28:32.360 --> 28:33.360
So you mean to tell me that this woman

28:33.360 --> 28:35.360
quit her QC100K job

28:35.360 --> 28:36.360
to pursue art?

28:36.360 --> 28:37.360
Honestly.

28:38.360 --> 28:39.360
Honestly.

28:39.360 --> 28:40.360
Honestly.

28:42.360 --> 28:43.360
The...

28:43.360 --> 28:45.360
Parge is peacekeeping.

28:45.360 --> 28:47.360
Oh, the parge is the baddies.

28:48.360 --> 28:50.360
Goodness me.

28:50.360 --> 28:52.360
Talk about readings in your ear.

28:52.360 --> 28:54.360
Wait, the headline says it's got an update,

28:54.360 --> 28:55.360
but we are on this one.

28:58.360 --> 29:00.360
It might be introled.

29:00.360 --> 29:01.360
There's a red symbol.

29:01.360 --> 29:02.360
I did get updated.

29:05.360 --> 29:06.360
Hmm.

29:06.360 --> 29:07.360
I'm missing something.

29:10.360 --> 29:11.360
What?

29:12.360 --> 29:14.360
It says there's something here.

29:14.360 --> 29:16.360
It must be to do with the safety bill, no?

29:17.360 --> 29:18.360
There's a bit of information

29:18.360 --> 29:20.360
we're supposed to be extracting here,

29:20.360 --> 29:21.360
and I can't find it.

29:23.360 --> 29:24.360
Come on, game high.

29:24.360 --> 29:25.360
Light it for me so I thought

29:25.360 --> 29:27.360
to use my brain.

29:28.360 --> 29:29.360
Due to recent stabilization,

29:29.360 --> 29:30.360
we've been able to reduce

29:30.360 --> 29:32.360
the number of station guards.

29:32.360 --> 29:33.360
Okay.

29:34.360 --> 29:35.360
Participate.

29:37.360 --> 29:38.360
Become a party.

29:39.360 --> 29:40.360
What?

29:40.360 --> 29:42.360
Safety bill, just temporary, so.

29:43.360 --> 29:45.360
Whoa, we've got the leaders.

29:46.360 --> 29:49.360
Look at all those people and stuff.

29:49.360 --> 29:51.360
Parge is peacekeeping.

29:51.360 --> 29:52.360
Okay, we get it.

29:52.360 --> 29:53.360
We get it, good, good.

29:53.360 --> 29:55.360
I don't see any information position.

29:55.360 --> 29:57.360
The five pillars of the great nation.

29:58.360 --> 30:00.360
Safety and security.

30:00.360 --> 30:02.360
Economy and commerce.

30:02.360 --> 30:04.360
Values and tradition.

30:04.360 --> 30:07.360
Migration and foreign affairs.

30:07.360 --> 30:09.360
Education and health.

30:09.360 --> 30:11.360
The five pillars.

30:11.360 --> 30:13.360
Okay, okay, we get it.

30:15.360 --> 30:16.360
Right.

30:19.360 --> 30:21.360
What does that blue mean at company?

30:28.360 --> 30:29.360
What does the blue mean,

30:29.360 --> 30:31.360
that this information, can I not?

30:33.360 --> 30:35.360
Well, she is an artist.

30:37.360 --> 30:40.360
I guess that way everything stays in the family.

30:40.360 --> 30:42.360
Being an artist and a junior seems a bit odd.

30:42.360 --> 30:44.360
She also mentioned she'd quit a dull job.

30:44.360 --> 30:46.360
Yeah, okay, well that's why I didn't put that down

30:46.360 --> 30:47.360
because she quit it.

30:47.360 --> 30:48.360
Okay.

30:48.360 --> 30:49.360
Okay, I'm starting to get it.

30:49.360 --> 30:50.360
I'm starting to get it.

30:50.360 --> 30:51.360
Right, jobs.

30:52.360 --> 30:53.360
What's going on here?

30:53.360 --> 30:56.360
We are urgently looking for a replacement.

30:56.360 --> 30:57.360
Okay.

30:59.360 --> 31:01.360
You gotta go back to work, Rip.

31:01.360 --> 31:03.360
Thank you for hanging though.

31:03.360 --> 31:04.360
Please don't worry, this is a bit of a,

31:04.360 --> 31:06.360
this is rather low energy.

31:06.360 --> 31:08.360
We're gonna have a lot more fun streams next week,

31:08.360 --> 31:09.360
I promise.

31:09.360 --> 31:11.360
Or maybe I was wrong and nothing stays in the family.

31:11.360 --> 31:14.360
Yup, this is probably what she meant by quitting her job.

31:14.360 --> 31:15.360
Good.

31:16.360 --> 31:19.360
Ooh, currently I'm thinking that our Miss Watergate

31:19.360 --> 31:22.360
underwent quite a radical change, don't you agree?

31:22.360 --> 31:23.360
Let's find out what happened

31:23.360 --> 31:25.360
in between these two lives of hers.

31:25.360 --> 31:27.360
What may have caused this shift?

31:27.360 --> 31:29.360
Let's find out.

31:29.360 --> 31:32.360
Because that timelines, what's timelines?

31:33.360 --> 31:36.360
Oh, it's like Facebook.

31:37.360 --> 31:38.360
Oh my God.

31:38.360 --> 31:41.360
1992, she's old.

31:43.360 --> 31:47.360
Do you remember in September?

31:49.360 --> 31:51.360
I love the soft spoken art.

31:51.360 --> 31:54.360
It's not the soft, me is just exhausted.

31:54.360 --> 31:57.360
Look at all those, look at all those Eggman's profile.

31:58.360 --> 32:01.360
She has an interest in art music and activism.

32:01.360 --> 32:03.360
Well, there you go.

32:03.360 --> 32:04.360
It's not that old.

32:04.360 --> 32:06.360
1992, hag, that's weird.

32:06.360 --> 32:09.360
Art music and activism, what a line up.

32:12.360 --> 32:14.360
She only just called me old.

32:14.360 --> 32:16.360
I don't mean that you're older.

32:16.360 --> 32:17.360
I like it.

32:17.360 --> 32:19.360
What do you mean someone so young and tiny

32:19.360 --> 32:22.360
has so much control over you?

32:22.360 --> 32:25.360
I mean, they mess up over a little bit.

32:27.360 --> 32:30.360
Sorry, 1992, bro, is what you're old.

32:30.360 --> 32:31.360
Yes, I'm old.

32:31.360 --> 32:33.360
Bones are decaying.

32:33.360 --> 32:35.360
They're becoming like powder.

32:35.360 --> 32:38.360
Woohoo, first day freed and far away from the shackles.

32:38.360 --> 32:41.360
So she didn't like her jab.

32:42.360 --> 32:46.360
Despite, oh, despite puppets,

32:46.360 --> 32:50.360
the spies you have finally managed to destroy.

32:50.360 --> 32:51.360
So there's nothing left to do.

32:51.360 --> 32:52.360
You can get there.

32:52.360 --> 32:54.360
My person wishes for you deep as the best.

32:55.360 --> 32:57.360
Opposes the government.

32:58.360 --> 32:59.360
What's the matter?

32:59.360 --> 33:02.360
That doesn't sound like you haven't hung out for ages.

33:03.360 --> 33:06.360
Mary, shut your frickin' mouth, okay?

33:06.360 --> 33:09.360
I'm not in the mood for your stupid act.

33:09.360 --> 33:11.360
I told you again and again.

33:11.360 --> 33:13.360
I can't deal with this right now.

33:14.360 --> 33:15.360
You know what?

33:15.360 --> 33:17.360
I'm really sorry that I still care about my best friend.

33:17.360 --> 33:20.360
No matter how often she decides to give me the cold shoulder.

33:20.360 --> 33:23.360
Because she's in a relationship.

33:23.360 --> 33:25.360
Okay, we can confirm that.

33:27.360 --> 33:31.360
You're randomly with the lawyer who might be noteworthy.

33:31.360 --> 33:36.360
Is this the beholder?

33:37.360 --> 33:39.360
Yeah, no, we knew it was him.

33:39.360 --> 33:42.360
Hold on, go back to the timeline, please.

33:42.360 --> 33:44.360
Right, you opposed the government.

33:44.360 --> 33:46.360
No, no, no, can't have that.

33:46.360 --> 33:49.360
Being against the government is very sus.

33:49.360 --> 33:54.360
Well, well, Miss Watergate, we aren't too fond of you either.

33:55.360 --> 33:58.360
Conflicting data.

33:58.360 --> 34:01.360
I don't know what the conflict is, though.

34:01.360 --> 34:03.360
At least you are redeemed.

34:03.360 --> 34:05.360
I want to blow off some steam together late night shopping.

34:05.360 --> 34:07.360
Not today, I have a date this evening.

34:07.360 --> 34:08.360
Ooh, who's the lucky one?

34:08.360 --> 34:10.360
Case closed, congrats.

34:10.360 --> 34:11.360
I never had any.

34:11.360 --> 34:13.360
Wait, Mary just seems really nice.

34:13.360 --> 34:16.360
Oh my God, isn't that the singer of the gorillas?

34:17.360 --> 34:19.360
Failed goods.

34:21.360 --> 34:23.360
Failed goods.

34:23.360 --> 34:25.360
Camels looking down on the camel's back.

34:25.360 --> 34:27.360
Hydration check.

34:29.360 --> 34:31.360
You know who I mean, though.

34:31.360 --> 34:33.360
I forgot his name.

34:36.360 --> 34:37.360
Okay, what's looking...

34:37.360 --> 34:38.360
Oh, here we go.

34:38.360 --> 34:42.360
Cassandra Shobin of the world is singing now.

34:44.360 --> 34:46.360
The concert is amazing, amazing.

34:46.360 --> 34:48.360
I just had to give my hair a little makeover,

34:48.360 --> 34:50.360
so without further ado, how do you like it?

34:50.360 --> 34:52.360
Okay, so she changed her hair for a concert.

34:53.360 --> 34:54.360
Cassie's gone punk.

34:54.360 --> 34:57.360
Did Momay and Daddy agree with that?

34:57.360 --> 34:58.360
Eggs, D.

34:58.360 --> 34:59.360
Looks nice.

35:01.360 --> 35:02.360
What new you?

35:02.360 --> 35:04.360
You also need a new name.

35:04.360 --> 35:05.360
What about this?

35:05.360 --> 35:06.360
That's the spirit girl now.

35:06.360 --> 35:08.360
I'd like to invite you to our little activist group

35:08.360 --> 35:09.360
if you want to join us.

35:09.360 --> 35:11.360
It would be nice to have you in the protest.

35:12.360 --> 35:13.360
Oh my God.

35:13.360 --> 35:15.360
I can't believe that the gorillas are against the government.

35:18.360 --> 35:19.360
An activist group.

35:19.360 --> 35:21.360
Is there anything more specific?

35:22.360 --> 35:24.360
So hence what Cassandra Shobin known to the world is

35:24.360 --> 35:25.360
Cassarthus.

35:30.360 --> 35:32.360
It's not going to actually update her name.

35:33.360 --> 35:34.360
Is this like a code name?

35:34.360 --> 35:36.360
You guys get given code names?

35:38.360 --> 35:39.360
An alias.

35:39.360 --> 35:40.360
Okay, okay, okay.

35:41.360 --> 35:42.360
An alias name.

35:42.360 --> 35:44.360
You know people on the web.

35:44.360 --> 35:46.360
So many names, so many identities.

35:46.360 --> 35:48.360
It's always good to recover or record any alias.

35:48.360 --> 35:50.360
Then we can match data chunks.

35:50.360 --> 35:51.360
Okay.

35:51.360 --> 35:52.360
Oh, there's a conversation.

35:53.360 --> 35:54.360
Did I miss a conversation?

35:56.360 --> 35:57.360
Oops, I did.

35:57.360 --> 35:58.360
Oh no, here we go.

35:58.360 --> 35:59.360
Recording starts.

35:59.360 --> 36:00.360
Let's go.

36:01.360 --> 36:03.360
Hey, did you hear about the

36:04.360 --> 36:05.360
La Bomba?

36:07.360 --> 36:08.360
Yeah, don't remind me.

36:08.360 --> 36:09.360
You know I have history with that place.

36:10.360 --> 36:12.360
So she's saying she wasn't there.

36:13.360 --> 36:14.360
The plot thickens.

36:15.360 --> 36:16.360
She's going by girls.

36:17.360 --> 36:18.360
Already messing with me.

36:19.360 --> 36:21.360
Enough that I have to catch a bus from there every day.

36:22.360 --> 36:23.360
Catches a bus every day.

36:24.360 --> 36:26.360
Okay, so we have evidence of her being at the location

36:27.360 --> 36:28.360
due to that bus comment.

36:29.360 --> 36:31.360
Meaning her presence there before the Bomba

36:32.360 --> 36:33.360
could be a coincidence after all.

36:34.360 --> 36:36.360
I'll reserve my thoughts and tell more evidence.

36:37.360 --> 36:38.360
I'm so

36:39.360 --> 36:40.360
co-member of thought,

36:41.360 --> 36:42.360
member of a group of people

36:42.360 --> 36:43.360
who have thought,

36:44.360 --> 36:45.360
member of a group called thought.

36:47.360 --> 36:49.360
If you would not have gone to the protest,

36:50.360 --> 36:51.360
you never would have been wrongfully,

36:52.360 --> 36:54.360
we'll keep that information wherever that is.

36:55.360 --> 36:56.360
You are not a,

36:57.360 --> 36:59.360
whoa, an activist group called thought,

37:00.360 --> 37:01.360
interesting, maybe this is what,

37:02.360 --> 37:03.360
the thought police, but the other way.

37:04.360 --> 37:05.360
We should find something that shows

37:06.360 --> 37:07.360
our current attitude to see if we're following

37:08.360 --> 37:09.360
the right person.

37:10.360 --> 37:11.360
Yeah, I would not have been called

37:12.360 --> 37:13.360
an activist in all the papers.

37:14.360 --> 37:15.360
You are not one, okay?

37:16.360 --> 37:17.360
Aren't I?

37:18.360 --> 37:19.360
You sure?

37:20.360 --> 37:21.360
Yeah, I'm pretty sure.

37:22.360 --> 37:23.360
Ka-ching!

37:24.360 --> 37:25.360
What?

37:26.360 --> 37:27.360
Is that supposed to be my credit card

37:28.360 --> 37:29.360
and the cash register?

37:30.360 --> 37:31.360
Something like that, I guess.

37:32.360 --> 37:33.360
I hope you, like, a

37:34.360 --> 37:35.360
shatoo-monger.

37:36.360 --> 37:37.360
And me just cringed, I'm sorry.

37:38.360 --> 37:39.360
Great.

37:40.360 --> 37:41.360
So you've decided to bankrupt me.

37:42.360 --> 37:43.360
I'm your boyfriend, Yosef.

37:44.360 --> 37:45.360
Uh, okay.

37:47.360 --> 37:48.360
Here's the thing,

37:49.360 --> 37:50.360
I've got an important appointment tonight.

37:51.360 --> 37:52.360
It's surprisingly out on my schedule

37:53.360 --> 37:54.360
and I can't postpone it.

37:55.360 --> 37:56.360
Postpone it!

37:57.360 --> 37:58.360
You've gotta be kidding me!

37:59.360 --> 38:00.360
I want that thing!

38:01.360 --> 38:02.360
I'm very sorry, darling.

38:03.360 --> 38:04.360
We'll have to see each other tomorrow, Cookie.

38:05.360 --> 38:06.360
You always have an appointment

38:07.360 --> 38:08.360
exclamation mark one.

38:09.360 --> 38:10.360
Appointment here, appointment there,

38:10.360 --> 38:11.360
appointment fucking everywhere!

38:12.360 --> 38:15.360
How can you constantly do this to me?

38:16.360 --> 38:17.360
Darling, please just calm down.

38:18.360 --> 38:20.360
Have you taken your drugs?

38:21.360 --> 38:22.360
Oh my god.

38:23.360 --> 38:26.360
Suspect is, is on, on drugs.

38:27.360 --> 38:28.360
Wait, can you look that up for me?

38:29.360 --> 38:30.360
Yeah, yeah, in a minute.

38:31.360 --> 38:32.360
Fine.

38:33.360 --> 38:34.360
If you don't show up at the appointment,

38:35.360 --> 38:37.360
I risk losing a very important appointment.

38:38.360 --> 38:39.360
Is he cheating on her?

38:40.360 --> 38:41.360
You know, I feel like if you're a lawyer,

38:42.360 --> 38:43.360
you have to make time for,

38:44.360 --> 38:45.360
if a client comes first and through your doors,

38:46.360 --> 38:47.360
you have to deal with it there and then.

38:48.360 --> 38:49.360
No, no, I totally understand.

38:50.360 --> 38:52.360
Don't you risk losing that very important client.

38:53.360 --> 38:54.360
Don't be like that.

38:55.360 --> 38:56.360
Come on, you know the, the de-fire.

38:57.360 --> 38:58.360
The de-fire!

38:59.360 --> 39:00.360
I get it.

39:01.360 --> 39:02.360
I guess I'm just not an important client anymore.

39:03.360 --> 39:04.360
Oh, come on, Kathy.

39:05.360 --> 39:06.360
Going home now in case I'm getting up

39:07.360 --> 39:08.360
on that priority list.

39:08.360 --> 39:09.360
Please.

39:10.360 --> 39:11.360
And then the session,

39:12.360 --> 39:13.360
this one goes right.

39:14.360 --> 39:15.360
Let's go figure out the product

39:16.360 --> 39:17.360
that began with an M,

39:18.360 --> 39:19.360
anti-depressant.

39:20.360 --> 39:21.360
Oh no, she's so volatile

39:22.360 --> 39:23.360
on anti-depressants.

39:24.360 --> 39:25.360
Yeah, so I think we're going to be fine.

39:26.360 --> 39:27.360
Oh, I clicked off that.

39:28.360 --> 39:29.360
Looking at what you've experienced so far,

39:30.360 --> 39:32.360
we're dealing with a potentially dangerous personality.

39:33.360 --> 39:34.360
I will indicate that to law enforcement.

39:35.360 --> 39:36.360
What?

39:36.360 --> 39:37.360
What are you doing?

39:38.360 --> 39:39.360
What anti-depressants?

39:40.360 --> 39:41.360
Right.

39:42.360 --> 39:43.360
I don't know what the conflicting thing is

39:44.360 --> 39:45.360
with this Mary.

39:46.360 --> 39:47.360
Having an amazing tour with Mary,

39:48.360 --> 39:49.360
my best friend.

39:50.360 --> 39:51.360
Right.

39:52.360 --> 39:53.360
So she says best friend

39:54.360 --> 39:56.360
and this is her with brown hair

39:57.360 --> 39:58.360
at the best friend stage.

40:04.360 --> 40:05.360
Just discovered this new band

40:06.360 --> 40:07.360
The Targets, Man in the Rock.

40:08.360 --> 40:09.360
Who's coming?

40:10.360 --> 40:11.360
Punk's not my style.

40:12.360 --> 40:13.360
Sorry, can't we just go see cherry cheeks sometime?

40:14.360 --> 40:15.360
Well, you can see my cherry cheeks

40:16.360 --> 40:17.360
any day we film.

40:18.360 --> 40:19.360
They are just not some punks.

40:20.360 --> 40:21.360
Their lead singers are real cutie

40:22.360 --> 40:23.360
and they've got a...

40:24.360 --> 40:25.360
Plus they've got a message.

40:26.360 --> 40:27.360
Why not?

40:28.360 --> 40:29.360
No, sorry, it's not for me.

40:30.360 --> 40:31.360
And then what?

40:32.360 --> 40:33.360
She starts changing.

40:34.360 --> 40:35.360
Oh my God, what happened to you?

40:37.360 --> 40:40.360
Oh, she's not replying to Mary at all here.

40:42.360 --> 40:43.360
Congrats, I never had any doubts.

40:45.360 --> 40:47.360
Oh, but she's not replying to Mary here.

40:48.360 --> 40:49.360
She's only replying to Juliet and

40:50.360 --> 40:51.360
Guerrilla Man.

40:54.360 --> 40:55.360
Oh, they did fall out.

40:58.360 --> 40:59.360
They have a broken friendship

41:00.360 --> 41:01.360
because Cassandra's been a weirdo.

41:03.360 --> 41:04.360
Guerrilla Man.

41:04.360 --> 41:05.360
Yeah, broken house ad.

41:06.360 --> 41:07.360
Yeah, and she got radicalized

41:08.360 --> 41:09.360
and doesn't want to talk to her pal anymore.

41:10.360 --> 41:11.360
Right, the thoughts.

41:12.360 --> 41:13.360
The thoughts are free.

41:14.360 --> 41:15.360
If liberty means anything at all,

41:16.360 --> 41:17.360
it means the right to tell people

41:18.360 --> 41:19.360
what they do not want to hear.

41:20.360 --> 41:21.360
George Orwell.

41:22.360 --> 41:23.360
It's thickened.

41:24.360 --> 41:25.360
Oh my God.

41:26.360 --> 41:27.360
Step one, secure the case.

41:28.360 --> 41:29.360
Okay.

41:30.360 --> 41:31.360
This is forbidden.

41:32.360 --> 41:33.360
Oh no, is everything broken?

41:34.360 --> 41:35.360
Let's do that.

41:36.360 --> 41:37.360
Oh, there's her alias name.

41:40.360 --> 41:41.360
Oh, she's already linked to all her stuff.

41:42.360 --> 41:43.360
We know about you.

41:45.360 --> 41:46.360
Step eight, Rizloth.

41:47.360 --> 41:48.360
For you, Mason.

41:49.360 --> 41:50.360
Not for me.

41:51.360 --> 41:52.360
Need to get some work done today.

41:53.360 --> 41:54.360
I'll have to catch the rest of the blood.

41:55.360 --> 41:56.360
Okay, thank you for hanging.

41:57.360 --> 41:58.360
Please don't worry, this is very, very low energy game.

41:59.360 --> 42:00.360
So this is just chilling in the background stuff.

42:01.360 --> 42:02.360
So don't worry.

42:02.360 --> 42:03.360
We're even at Freedom Plaza.

42:04.360 --> 42:05.360
Is that just me?

42:06.360 --> 42:07.360
Or is that ironic?

42:08.360 --> 42:09.360
You probably all know me.

42:10.360 --> 42:11.360
It's either that blue-haired punk bi-youch.

42:13.360 --> 42:14.360
Oh my God.

42:15.360 --> 42:16.360
These are only some of the names

42:17.360 --> 42:18.360
that we called during the criminal investigation.

42:19.360 --> 42:20.360
That was because in the middle of the chaos,

42:21.360 --> 42:22.360
someone believed to have seen me hurt an officer.

42:23.360 --> 42:25.360
It never even occurred to anybody that it wasn't me.

42:26.360 --> 42:28.360
We were there because we wanted a peaceful protest.

42:29.360 --> 42:30.360
We have always been against violence.

42:30.360 --> 42:31.360
Hmm.

42:32.360 --> 42:33.360
And what's the conflicting data?

42:34.360 --> 42:35.360
One would assume that in the age where

42:36.360 --> 42:37.360
all the camps are everywhere,

42:38.360 --> 42:39.360
I don't even find the conflicting piece.

42:42.360 --> 42:43.360
By goldfells.

42:46.360 --> 42:47.360
Where's the conflicting piece of information?

42:51.360 --> 42:52.360
Alright, someone called Guest.

42:53.360 --> 42:54.360
Hey, interesting name by the way.

42:55.360 --> 42:56.360
Just stumbled upon your new blog and some truth here.

42:57.360 --> 42:58.360
The web was born in the sense of ultimate freedom

42:59.360 --> 43:00.360
to be who you want to be and express yourself.

43:01.360 --> 43:02.360
Now that the government has threatened this

43:03.360 --> 43:04.360
with real name policies and stuff,

43:05.360 --> 43:06.360
saves your IP, so you can look up who you are.

43:07.360 --> 43:08.360
Wasn't there...

43:09.360 --> 43:10.360
Right, okay, this is Tinfoil Talk.

43:11.360 --> 43:12.360
This is me, Tinfoil Talk.

43:13.360 --> 43:14.360
I'm sure I saw a post that was like,

43:15.360 --> 43:19.360
oh, sweet man-made thing beyond my comprehension.

43:20.360 --> 43:24.360
And it was like, your PC can clock your room details

43:25.360 --> 43:26.360
and the inside schematics of your house.

43:26.360 --> 43:28.360
And I'm like, 99% sure that got proved

43:29.360 --> 43:33.360
because it has like, something with it that can do that.

43:34.360 --> 43:36.360
But I don't know if that's Tinfoil or if that's real real

43:37.360 --> 43:39.360
and I fell for like a coffee past or something.

43:41.360 --> 43:43.360
Oh, sweet man-made horrors beyond my comprehension.

43:44.360 --> 43:45.360
Yay!

43:46.360 --> 43:47.360
The best part of this game is when you start getting

43:48.360 --> 43:50.360
how bad all the things are and you're doing the spine.

43:51.360 --> 43:53.360
It can be done now, yeah, they use your router, yeah.

43:53.360 --> 43:56.360
Yeah, hardware, back doors, and tracking every device.

43:57.360 --> 43:58.360
Rep.

43:59.360 --> 44:00.360
Okay, I thought I was making it up, but I guess it's real.

44:01.360 --> 44:02.360
Hello, admin.

44:03.360 --> 44:04.360
I'd like to say, could you be one...

44:05.360 --> 44:06.360
To get a service on search engine, other...

44:07.360 --> 44:08.360
Oh, is this just a fucking random mail?

44:09.360 --> 44:10.360
What do you say?

44:11.360 --> 44:12.360
Well, if you don't have one before,

44:13.360 --> 44:14.360
you've just gained yourself your first follower.

44:15.360 --> 44:16.360
Okay, let's go on his profile.

44:20.360 --> 44:22.360
Hmm, it's got five articles.

44:24.360 --> 44:27.360
Okay, and I'm guessing all the archive ones are inaccessible.

44:28.360 --> 44:30.360
So, this has got conflicting.

44:31.360 --> 44:33.360
There's a conflicting with show the conflict.

44:34.360 --> 44:35.360
No, I don't know where it is.

44:38.360 --> 44:40.360
No, it's not showing me where it is.

44:41.360 --> 44:43.360
Oh, no, I'm gonna have to find it like a good girl.

44:45.360 --> 44:46.360
Finally, someone who has the...

44:53.360 --> 44:54.360
Oh, you've kind of fucked up with that one.

44:55.360 --> 44:56.360
I have to admit.

44:57.360 --> 44:58.360
You can't say you're about peace,

44:59.360 --> 45:00.360
but then go on Facebook and be like,

45:01.360 --> 45:02.360
XD.

45:03.360 --> 45:04.360
Finally, someone who has the grit and explosives

45:05.360 --> 45:08.360
to show how futile surveillance is.

45:11.360 --> 45:15.360
C's assault justified for showing the futility of the surveillance.

45:16.360 --> 45:17.360
Ooh.

45:21.360 --> 45:22.360
Really cat?

45:23.360 --> 45:24.360
You're laughing at people being killed.

45:25.360 --> 45:26.360
Are you out of your mind?

45:27.360 --> 45:30.360
Yeah, I'm sorry, but, bro, that's very tasteless.

45:33.360 --> 45:34.360
I suspected as much.

45:35.360 --> 45:36.360
Seems like we're looking at the right person.

45:37.360 --> 45:38.360
I don't think it was her that did it,

45:39.360 --> 45:41.360
but she's a sympathizer.

45:42.360 --> 45:43.360
All right.

45:43.360 --> 45:45.360
What we've found out so far is a good and interesting,

45:46.360 --> 45:48.360
but I think we should be searching for something a little more concrete.

45:49.360 --> 45:51.360
We have to dig deeper.

45:52.360 --> 45:53.360
Okay.

45:54.360 --> 45:55.360
Listening into a conversation.

45:56.360 --> 45:57.360
Absolutely.

45:58.360 --> 45:59.360
Juliet.

46:00.360 --> 46:01.360
Hello.

46:02.360 --> 46:03.360
Hi, Jules.

46:04.360 --> 46:05.360
Is this so much fellow?

46:06.360 --> 46:07.360
Cass, I just want to know.

46:08.360 --> 46:09.360
Wanted to know.

46:10.360 --> 46:11.360
You're post on timelines about the assault.

46:11.360 --> 46:13.360
You really shouldn't write stuff like that.

46:14.360 --> 46:17.360
Really, Jules, you're not going to preach to me about this stupid post, are you?

46:18.360 --> 46:19.360
No.

46:20.360 --> 46:21.360
I just wanted to know what's wrong, Cass.

46:22.360 --> 46:24.360
It's nothing just between the two of us.

46:28.360 --> 46:30.360
I just had to let off steam, you know?

46:31.360 --> 46:32.360
It's because of what happened, isn't it?

46:33.360 --> 46:35.360
Yeah, and lots and lots of other stuff, too.

46:38.360 --> 46:40.360
The bombing stirred up all this crap again.

46:41.360 --> 46:43.360
You know, what I did.

46:44.360 --> 46:45.360
What did you do?

46:46.360 --> 46:48.360
What happened there wasn't your fault.

46:49.360 --> 46:50.360
Hey, Miss Tinfoil, what's the game about?

46:51.360 --> 46:52.360
Tinfoil?

46:53.360 --> 46:54.360
You'll never guess.

46:55.360 --> 46:56.360
Tinfoil?

46:57.360 --> 47:00.360
Cass, you hurt that officer to save me and you succeeded.

47:01.360 --> 47:02.360
You mustn't forget about that.

47:03.360 --> 47:04.360
How can it not have been my fault?

47:05.360 --> 47:07.360
Juliet, I smashed a freaking skull of a father because I lost it.

47:08.360 --> 47:09.360
Wait, what?

47:10.360 --> 47:13.360
Admit guilt towards for having injured the officer.

47:15.360 --> 47:16.360
To protect them.

47:17.360 --> 47:20.360
Well, it was a protection job, so I'll let you.

47:21.360 --> 47:23.360
I'll let you injure the officer to protect.

47:24.360 --> 47:25.360
What? Where did that come from?

47:26.360 --> 47:28.360
This is perfect. We can arrest her and open the investigation again.

47:29.360 --> 47:32.360
However, we probably won't be able to hold her for long if that really happened in defense.

47:33.360 --> 47:34.360
Very good work.

47:35.360 --> 47:37.360
The intervention team is already on its way.

47:37.360 --> 47:39.360
We'll need to wait for confirmation.

47:40.360 --> 47:46.360
If Miss Water, in Miss Water Gates case, it was not a problem to get her dressed.

47:47.360 --> 47:50.360
With the help of local police due to her former record.

47:51.360 --> 47:53.360
Oh, Sheevie's getting a clip of her burp, by the way.

47:54.360 --> 47:55.360
I just let you guys should know that.

47:56.360 --> 48:00.360
And Amy sent me clips of her feet, so don't be shocked when you see shots like that.

48:01.360 --> 48:03.360
I feel like a butthole and worse kind of butthole.

48:04.360 --> 48:05.360
I might be free, but not right.

48:05.360 --> 48:06.360
I'm not innocent.

48:07.360 --> 48:08.360
Okay, nobody's innocent.

48:09.360 --> 48:10.360
You'll have to let go.

48:11.360 --> 48:12.360
Okay, we're learning.

48:13.360 --> 48:14.360
Oh, wait, she's going back onto her.

48:15.360 --> 48:17.360
It was a bit late in finding that info.

48:18.360 --> 48:20.360
Five minutes later, Miss Timfoyle, or oh, she.

48:21.360 --> 48:22.360
FBI, open up.

48:23.360 --> 48:24.360
I thought about what you said.

48:25.360 --> 48:26.360
Maybe you're right. I should take the post down.

48:27.360 --> 48:28.360
Oh, we've already reported it.

48:29.360 --> 48:30.360
You're a bit too late.

48:31.360 --> 48:32.360
It would be better.

48:33.360 --> 48:34.360
Believe me.

48:35.360 --> 48:36.360
Are you getting taken down in real time?

48:39.360 --> 48:40.360
FBI, open up.

48:42.360 --> 48:44.360
By the way, how is your boyfriend?

48:47.360 --> 48:48.360
You're still together.

48:49.360 --> 48:50.360
You haven't been talking about him that much lately.

48:51.360 --> 48:52.360
Well, not as much as before.

48:53.360 --> 48:56.360
Oh my God, we're about to literally get it live streamed to us.

48:57.360 --> 48:58.360
Hello?

48:59.360 --> 49:00.360
Are you still there?

49:01.360 --> 49:02.360
Too late, strong and co-locked you.

49:03.360 --> 49:06.360
I'll inquire if all went well with arresting Miss Wargate.

49:07.360 --> 49:08.360
You did a good job in any case.

49:09.360 --> 49:11.360
Although we have no proof she's involved in the bomba.

49:12.360 --> 49:13.360
We might be able to question her.

49:14.360 --> 49:15.360
Despite acting in defense of Australia,

49:16.360 --> 49:19.360
she seems to be quite unstable and unstable.

49:20.360 --> 49:21.360
She's on anti-depressants.

49:22.360 --> 49:23.360
She's just, you know,

49:24.360 --> 49:25.360
seeing the world for what it is.

49:26.360 --> 49:28.360
Okay, I just received information she's in custody.

49:29.360 --> 49:30.360
Good work.

49:30.360 --> 49:32.360
This thought group though, whether they, oh God.

49:33.360 --> 49:35.360
No, no, no, take a look at the news.

49:38.360 --> 49:39.360
They struck again.

49:42.360 --> 49:43.360
That's horrible.

49:44.360 --> 49:45.360
Two dead after second explosion.

49:46.360 --> 49:47.360
Two dead, similar approach.

49:48.360 --> 49:49.360
Same letter found.

49:50.360 --> 49:51.360
So these are, letter?

49:52.360 --> 49:53.360
I don't remember reading a letter.

49:54.360 --> 49:55.360
And if that wasn't enough already,

49:56.360 --> 49:57.360
Miss Wargate was in custody.

49:58.360 --> 49:59.360
So that's her at the picture,

50:00.360 --> 50:01.360
this complicates matters massively.

50:02.360 --> 50:03.360
So much for our simple test case.

50:04.360 --> 50:06.360
I need to speak to my superiors,

50:07.360 --> 50:09.360
see how they are to proceed

50:10.360 --> 50:11.360
given these extenuating circumstances.

50:12.360 --> 50:13.360
You did good today.

50:14.360 --> 50:15.360
You can log off and get some rest by clicking the button

50:16.360 --> 50:17.360
on the top right of the desk.

50:18.360 --> 50:19.360
Try and get some sleep.

50:20.360 --> 50:21.360
I'm trying.

50:22.360 --> 50:23.360
I have a feeling the next few days are going to be bad.

50:24.360 --> 50:25.360
Let's see what this is though.

50:26.360 --> 50:27.360
Explosion self at a university in Bondton,

50:27.360 --> 50:29.360
at least two passed away, three injured.

50:30.360 --> 50:31.360
Once again, a letter has been received

50:32.360 --> 50:33.360
just before the crime.

50:35.360 --> 50:36.360
Second bomb has hit freedom of square.

50:40.360 --> 50:42.360
Even the game knows I need sleep through.

50:43.360 --> 50:44.360
Are you sure you want to finish the work for today?

50:45.360 --> 50:46.360
Oh, I'm pressed.

50:47.360 --> 50:48.360
Oh.

50:49.360 --> 50:50.360
What's been undone?

50:54.360 --> 50:55.360
There was like one in here.

50:55.360 --> 50:56.360
What?

50:57.360 --> 50:58.360
A colorful...

51:00.360 --> 51:01.360
No.

51:02.360 --> 51:03.360
That's not going to disable it.

51:04.360 --> 51:05.360
Okay.

51:06.360 --> 51:07.360
Okay, so that's everything.

51:08.360 --> 51:09.360
There was like one thing I omitted.

51:10.360 --> 51:11.360
She celebrates people's death.

51:12.360 --> 51:13.360
So yeah, I've done that a lot.

51:14.360 --> 51:15.360
Even for me.

51:16.360 --> 51:17.360
I have to be back there.

51:18.360 --> 51:19.360
Bye bye.

51:20.360 --> 51:21.360
That was the tutorial section done.

51:22.360 --> 51:23.360
We've already done one out of five.

51:23.360 --> 51:24.360
Okay.

51:25.360 --> 51:26.360
Oh, I haven't got an achievement.

51:26.360 --> 51:27.360
Complete episode one.

51:30.360 --> 51:31.360
That's a lot.

51:33.360 --> 51:34.360
I just want to say thank you to everyone

51:34.360 --> 51:36.360
who's clipping the girls at any point.

51:37.360 --> 51:39.360
It really helps them find clips faster

51:39.360 --> 51:41.360
so we can shove them to the editing team.

51:42.360 --> 51:43.360
That was the tutorial.

51:43.360 --> 51:44.360
Yes.

51:44.360 --> 51:46.360
I'm like 99% sure that was the tutorial.

51:46.360 --> 51:48.360
I played this game out quite a few years back now.

51:49.360 --> 51:50.360
I don't remember it that well.

51:51.360 --> 51:53.360
She's been criminally charged in the past

51:54.360 --> 51:55.360
with injuring an officer.

51:55.360 --> 51:56.360
She's an artist.

51:57.360 --> 51:58.360
Former criminal case.

51:59.360 --> 52:00.360
But got dropped.

52:01.360 --> 52:02.360
A second assault.

52:02.360 --> 52:03.360
Activist group thought.

52:04.360 --> 52:06.360
So we're going to have to look into that.

52:07.360 --> 52:08.360
Okay, bedtime.

52:08.360 --> 52:09.360
Good night guys.

52:09.360 --> 52:10.360
See you tomorrow.

52:11.360 --> 52:12.360
I'm so sleepy.

52:13.360 --> 52:14.360
I just want to sleep on your chest.

52:15.360 --> 52:17.360
I want to be like a cat and need into your chest.

52:17.360 --> 52:18.360
Like me.

52:20.360 --> 52:21.360
Okay, welcome back.

52:21.360 --> 52:23.360
Hope you don't mind if we get started right away.

52:23.360 --> 52:25.360
We have tons of work ahead of us.

52:25.360 --> 52:27.360
I met with my superiors and they wished

52:27.360 --> 52:29.360
to continue with the test case.

52:29.360 --> 52:31.360
They believe in the capability of Orwell

52:31.360 --> 52:32.360
to handle this.

52:32.360 --> 52:33.360
Oh, Andrew of course.

52:33.360 --> 52:35.360
Yes, me who's behind Orwell.

52:35.360 --> 52:36.360
Okay, let's go to bed.

52:36.360 --> 52:37.360
Yeah.

52:38.360 --> 52:39.360
Gentle.

52:40.360 --> 52:41.360
Okay, my superiors agreement.

52:41.360 --> 52:43.360
Based on the information you have already extracted

52:43.360 --> 52:45.360
the activist group known as Thought

52:45.360 --> 52:47.360
is worth investigating.

52:47.360 --> 52:49.360
It seems that this goldfills

52:49.360 --> 52:51.360
is an important member of Thought.

52:51.360 --> 52:53.360
So we now have clearance

52:53.360 --> 52:55.360
to consider them a target person.

52:55.360 --> 52:57.360
Are you going to part two?

52:57.360 --> 52:58.360
Heck yeah.

52:58.360 --> 53:00.360
I'm one like a mmm.

53:00.360 --> 53:01.360
When it's good.

53:03.360 --> 53:05.360
Sleep on our laps if you need rest, honestly.

53:05.360 --> 53:08.360
I got a really cute fanart yesterday on Twitter.

53:08.360 --> 53:10.360
I replied to it if you didn't see it.

53:10.360 --> 53:12.360
And it was like all these reeflings in bed with me.

53:12.360 --> 53:14.360
One of them was a furry.

53:14.360 --> 53:16.360
They had an echo ears.

53:17.360 --> 53:19.360
One looked like it had a wee mustache

53:19.360 --> 53:21.360
when it was climbing on the bed.

53:21.360 --> 53:22.360
Another reefling.

53:22.360 --> 53:25.360
I think it was massage on my shoulders.

53:27.360 --> 53:29.360
And like there's like three reeflings

53:29.360 --> 53:30.360
bunched up on the other side of me.

53:30.360 --> 53:31.360
It was really cute.

53:31.360 --> 53:32.360
I liked it.

53:32.360 --> 53:33.360
There's Kawainee.

53:34.360 --> 53:36.360
I only remember like episode four.

53:36.360 --> 53:37.360
It was probably my favorite.

53:39.360 --> 53:41.360
Okay, now that goldfills is a target person

53:41.360 --> 53:43.360
there may be a new data chunk

53:43.360 --> 53:45.360
available in documents you have already

53:45.360 --> 53:46.360
accessed.

53:46.360 --> 53:48.360
Don't forget to go back and recheck your sources.

53:48.360 --> 53:49.360
Okay.

53:50.360 --> 53:52.360
Whoa, we are getting

53:53.360 --> 53:54.360
a lot of...

53:54.360 --> 53:56.360
Okay, so that's parents.

53:56.360 --> 53:57.360
Yosef.

53:57.360 --> 53:58.360
Yulia.

53:58.360 --> 53:59.360
Yeah.

54:00.360 --> 54:03.360
Okay, we've got a little bit of an up the entry one.

54:03.360 --> 54:05.360
Our thoughts still free.

54:05.360 --> 54:06.360
Okay, we've got a pic.

54:06.360 --> 54:07.360
Nope.

54:07.360 --> 54:09.360
Let's push up on you.

54:09.360 --> 54:11.360
Let's add your picture, bruv.

54:12.360 --> 54:14.360
Just needed one reading.

54:14.360 --> 54:16.360
You go the F to sleep.

54:16.360 --> 54:17.360
I might make that.

54:17.360 --> 54:19.360
I think it's quite humorous.

54:19.360 --> 54:22.360
Okay, I propose to consider the question

54:22.360 --> 54:24.360
are our thoughts still free?

54:24.360 --> 54:27.360
Well, this might seem to be a surprising question.

54:27.360 --> 54:30.360
In our current world of ever growing digital surveillance

54:30.360 --> 54:33.360
freedom of thought is no longer self-evident.

54:33.360 --> 54:36.360
Dear reader, there is a German folk song

54:36.360 --> 54:38.360
called the thoughts are free.

54:39.360 --> 54:41.360
It goes like this.

54:41.360 --> 54:42.360
Thoughts are free.

54:42.360 --> 54:43.360
Who can guess them?

54:43.360 --> 54:46.360
They fly like the nocturnal shadows.

54:46.360 --> 54:48.360
No man can know them.

54:48.360 --> 54:51.360
No hunter can shoot them with the powder and lead.

54:51.360 --> 54:52.360
Thoughts are free.

54:52.360 --> 54:53.360
I am not reading this properly.

54:53.360 --> 54:56.360
I think what I want and what delights me

54:56.360 --> 54:57.360
still always...

54:57.360 --> 54:59.360
Ah, I don't know these words.

54:59.360 --> 55:01.360
Okay, when I was a young lad,

55:01.360 --> 55:06.360
long before I immigrated to the nation in 1993

55:06.360 --> 55:08.360
memes are free, exactly.

55:08.360 --> 55:09.360
That's the best.

55:09.360 --> 55:11.360
I cannot read chunks like this.

55:11.360 --> 55:12.360
It's going to mess with me.

55:12.360 --> 55:13.360
An immigrant.

55:13.360 --> 55:16.360
Oh no, the racism starts quick.

55:16.360 --> 55:19.360
This is why I created this blog.

55:19.360 --> 55:22.360
Okay, so he's a creator of thoughts,

55:22.360 --> 55:23.360
which is fine.

55:23.360 --> 55:26.360
Get to know the thoughts in activist group

55:26.360 --> 55:28.360
with the same name as this blog.

55:28.360 --> 55:32.360
If God fails as the one who created the blog,

55:32.360 --> 55:35.360
perhaps he founded or even the leader of the activist group.

55:36.360 --> 55:37.360
Hiya.

55:37.360 --> 55:40.360
Oh, they're just talking.

55:40.360 --> 55:45.360
Okay, that's the same comments as before though.

55:45.360 --> 55:48.360
Mentions focused on thoughts are free.

55:48.360 --> 55:52.360
I mean, this is such a small nuance.

55:52.360 --> 55:53.360
Okay, headlines.

55:53.360 --> 55:54.360
What's today?

55:54.360 --> 55:58.360
Connection between the bomba to the gallows.

55:58.360 --> 56:01.360
Write that down, write that down.

56:01.360 --> 56:04.360
Random German in the chat that I can't translate.

56:04.360 --> 56:06.360
Heavy rainstorms expected.

56:06.360 --> 56:08.360
That's very important.

56:08.360 --> 56:09.360
Yes, yes.

56:09.360 --> 56:12.360
Timeline and Rossin announced cooperation.

56:12.360 --> 56:13.360
Who are they?

56:13.360 --> 56:17.360
The Davenport siblings, owners of the biggest social network.

56:17.360 --> 56:19.360
Oh no.

56:19.360 --> 56:22.360
Everyone's surveilled and said 10 times harder.

56:22.360 --> 56:25.360
Let's see what the bomba is going on.

56:25.360 --> 56:27.360
Any highlighting notes?

56:27.360 --> 56:28.360
No.

56:28.360 --> 56:30.360
What about this?

56:30.360 --> 56:32.360
That is all your personal data.

56:32.360 --> 56:35.360
Just get on like that.

56:35.360 --> 56:38.360
We are literally singing the song you saw a minute ago.

56:38.360 --> 56:39.360
Oh, where he is?

56:39.360 --> 56:40.360
I'm so sorry.

56:40.360 --> 56:42.360
I don't recognize that.

56:42.360 --> 56:43.360
Cassandra update.

56:43.360 --> 56:45.360
What's going on with you?

56:45.360 --> 56:50.360
Oh, she is redacted.

56:50.360 --> 56:53.360
She's in trouble.

56:53.360 --> 56:58.360
Okay, there's something here on the website.

56:58.360 --> 57:03.360
I think.

57:03.360 --> 57:07.360
Is there something on the website?

57:07.360 --> 57:13.360
I have a little red mark.

57:13.360 --> 57:14.360
Do I really need to...

57:14.360 --> 57:15.360
Okay, fine.

57:15.360 --> 57:18.360
Our report thoughts are free.

57:18.360 --> 57:19.360
Okay, right.

57:19.360 --> 57:21.360
Just if it's harmless, report it.

57:21.360 --> 57:22.360
The letter.

57:22.360 --> 57:23.360
We are right, it seems.

57:23.360 --> 57:26.360
That's what the letter says.

57:26.360 --> 57:30.360
The thoughts are free?

57:30.360 --> 57:31.360
That's terrible.

57:31.360 --> 57:34.360
If that's true.

57:34.360 --> 57:37.360
Who's listening?

57:37.360 --> 57:39.360
Hey, you.

57:39.360 --> 57:43.360
Hi.

57:43.360 --> 57:44.360
I'm sorry about last night.

57:44.360 --> 57:45.360
I really should have come over.

57:45.360 --> 57:46.360
Well, you didn't.

57:46.360 --> 57:49.360
So what are you going to say to that?

57:49.360 --> 57:50.360
What's the calling card?

57:50.360 --> 57:52.360
Where did we get it?

57:52.360 --> 57:53.360
Wait a minute.

57:53.360 --> 57:54.360
The government doesn't want you to know this,

57:54.360 --> 57:55.360
but thoughts are free.

57:55.360 --> 57:57.360
You can just take them.

57:57.360 --> 58:00.360
Yank.

58:00.360 --> 58:03.360
It's just that this client is massively influential

58:03.360 --> 58:05.360
and could have break a whole lot of exposure.

58:05.360 --> 58:07.360
I've been trying to get a meeting for months

58:07.360 --> 58:08.360
and it went rather well.

58:08.360 --> 58:09.360
So here's hoping.

58:09.360 --> 58:10.360
God, I'm such a stupid old man

58:10.360 --> 58:12.360
who just talks about his job too much.

58:12.360 --> 58:13.360
I'm sorry.

58:13.360 --> 58:14.360
It's just a big part of my life.

58:14.360 --> 58:15.360
Hello?

58:15.360 --> 58:16.360
Are you still upset?

58:16.360 --> 58:18.360
Oh, he doesn't know that she's in jail.

58:18.360 --> 58:20.360
She's got the jail.

58:20.360 --> 58:21.360
Can you answer me if you don't?

58:21.360 --> 58:22.360
I'll start to worry.

58:22.360 --> 58:23.360
You know what I'm like?

58:23.360 --> 58:24.360
She's in jail.

58:24.360 --> 58:25.360
She's in jail.

58:25.360 --> 58:26.360
You just don't know.

58:26.360 --> 58:27.360
Okay.

58:27.360 --> 58:31.360
I thirdly believed we are able to capture minds

58:31.360 --> 58:34.360
if only we could garner attention to the group.

58:34.360 --> 58:37.360
After one and a half years recruiting two of my students

58:37.360 --> 58:40.360
and arranging three demonstrations.

58:40.360 --> 58:46.360
So he's the one that's kind of mastermind in it a bit.

58:46.360 --> 58:48.360
Three demonstrations.

58:48.360 --> 58:50.360
More interesting might be the two students

58:50.360 --> 58:51.360
that were involved.

58:51.360 --> 58:52.360
Okay.

58:52.360 --> 58:56.360
Frankly and sadly, the answer to the latter is a resounding no,

58:56.360 --> 59:00.360
which was the question was are we true to the initial goal?

59:00.360 --> 59:03.360
We let ourselves be consumed by anger and hatred

59:03.360 --> 59:06.360
towards those who did wrong.

59:06.360 --> 59:09.360
Reacts with hatred and anger about troubled past of thought,

59:09.360 --> 59:11.360
hinted at troubled past.

59:11.360 --> 59:14.360
Thoughts are free, but that does not mean that we can attack

59:14.360 --> 59:17.360
or do whatever they wish instead of blaming others.

59:17.360 --> 59:21.360
I see now my high aims might well be the cause

59:21.360 --> 59:24.360
for all of the events of the past months.

59:24.360 --> 59:27.360
More than anyone else have thought, I feel responsible.

59:27.360 --> 59:29.360
Hmm.

59:29.360 --> 59:31.360
Feels responsible.

59:31.360 --> 59:34.360
Reacts with hatred and anger.

59:36.360 --> 59:39.360
I think feels responsible.

59:39.360 --> 59:42.360
Because look, as a consequence, I'll halt my activities.

59:42.360 --> 59:44.360
So he feels responsible.

59:44.360 --> 59:45.360
Okay.

59:46.360 --> 59:48.360
I will halt my activities.

59:48.360 --> 59:50.360
Oops, sorry.

59:50.360 --> 59:53.360
A troubled past, we will have to get to the bottom of this.

59:53.360 --> 59:56.360
But he's going to stop his activities.

59:56.360 --> 01:00:00.360
Oh man, my duck army crew is a violent group.

01:00:00.360 --> 01:00:02.360
Write that down.

01:00:02.360 --> 01:00:06.360
Whatever active engagement means still an interesting fact.

01:00:06.360 --> 01:00:09.360
He is a lecturer at a university.

01:00:09.360 --> 01:00:10.360
Yes.

01:00:10.360 --> 01:00:12.360
Oh, and we've got a really good thing.

01:00:12.360 --> 01:00:14.360
What now?

01:00:15.360 --> 01:00:16.360
What now?

01:00:16.360 --> 01:00:17.360
Still again?

01:00:17.360 --> 01:00:20.360
The same still again where the bomb popped its clogs?

01:00:20.360 --> 01:00:24.360
You know what I think about coincidence is I ain't going to repeat it.

01:00:24.360 --> 01:00:28.360
So far the evidence suggests that Goldfels was a prominent lecturer

01:00:28.360 --> 01:00:31.360
and some of his students became involved in thought.

01:00:31.360 --> 01:00:33.360
Did he like recruit them for the cause?

01:00:33.360 --> 01:00:35.360
We need to identify those students.

01:00:35.360 --> 01:00:37.360
See who else is involved in that group.

01:00:37.360 --> 01:00:39.360
Concerned number one.

01:00:39.360 --> 01:00:40.360
Please reconsider.

01:00:40.360 --> 01:00:44.360
Guy, her, there was only a call.

01:00:44.360 --> 01:00:45.360
They had it coming.

01:00:45.360 --> 01:00:47.360
It was messy, I know.

01:00:47.360 --> 01:00:49.360
You made the news.

01:00:49.360 --> 01:00:53.360
Beryl, thank you for becoming a member for a month.

01:00:53.360 --> 01:00:55.360
A little celebration anniversary.

01:00:55.360 --> 01:00:57.360
It works on you.

01:00:59.360 --> 01:01:01.360
You didn't put a wee thing.

01:01:01.360 --> 01:01:02.360
You could have put a message.

01:01:02.360 --> 01:01:03.360
I can read it.

01:01:03.360 --> 01:01:06.360
You forgot to put a message.

01:01:06.360 --> 01:01:07.360
It's okay.

01:01:07.360 --> 01:01:08.360
Okay.

01:01:08.360 --> 01:01:10.360
I'll just make up a message.

01:01:10.360 --> 01:01:11.360
Strongly love.

01:01:11.360 --> 01:01:13.360
Briefing love.

01:01:13.360 --> 01:01:15.360
Okay, I made it for you.

01:01:15.360 --> 01:01:16.360
Continue to main page.

01:01:16.360 --> 01:01:18.360
What's going on here?

01:01:18.360 --> 01:01:26.360
Yesterday there was a microwave incident with popcorn in a blue.

01:01:26.360 --> 01:01:29.360
It wrapped itself up in tin foil and blew itself up.

01:01:29.360 --> 01:01:32.360
Are you squidding me right now?

01:01:32.360 --> 01:01:34.360
Nugget.

01:01:34.360 --> 01:01:37.360
Nugget said a message.

01:01:37.360 --> 01:01:40.360
Thank you for becoming a member for a month.

01:01:40.360 --> 01:01:41.360
How do you say it?

01:01:41.360 --> 01:01:45.360
Did I be like, oh, thank you for the repeated membership?

01:01:45.360 --> 01:01:47.360
Or continued membership?

01:01:47.360 --> 01:01:48.360
Yeah.

01:01:48.360 --> 01:01:50.360
Thank you for the continued membership.

01:01:50.360 --> 01:01:52.360
Why, yes, of course.

01:01:52.360 --> 01:01:55.360
Are you squidding me right now?

01:01:55.360 --> 01:01:58.360
It's already been a month.

01:01:58.360 --> 01:01:59.360
That's pretty crazy.

01:01:59.360 --> 01:02:01.360
Honestly, all things considered.

01:02:01.360 --> 01:02:03.360
How did we get here?

01:02:03.360 --> 01:02:05.360
Oh, my God.

01:02:05.360 --> 01:02:08.360
Oh, my God.

01:02:08.360 --> 01:02:09.360
Thanks for the sub.

01:02:09.360 --> 01:02:11.360
Thanks for the second month.

01:02:11.360 --> 01:02:13.360
Oh, yeah, it's technically the thing.

01:02:13.360 --> 01:02:15.360
It's technically the second.

01:02:15.360 --> 01:02:18.360
No, one full month because it starts on zero.

01:02:18.360 --> 01:02:20.360
So this is the first full month.

01:02:20.360 --> 01:02:21.360
Thank you.

01:02:21.360 --> 01:02:22.360
Yeah.

01:02:22.360 --> 01:02:24.360
Oh, you've all got blue seashells now.

01:02:24.360 --> 01:02:29.360
Sally sells seashells by the seashore.

01:02:29.360 --> 01:02:32.360
He's retired.

01:02:32.360 --> 01:02:34.360
Oops.

01:02:34.360 --> 01:02:35.360
Who's this?

01:02:35.360 --> 01:02:38.360
Oh, it's him.

01:02:38.360 --> 01:02:41.360
Got another picture of him.

01:02:41.360 --> 01:02:43.360
We are in the second month.

01:02:43.360 --> 01:02:45.360
Blue seashell team.

01:02:45.360 --> 01:02:48.360
Being a luminary in his profession.

01:02:48.360 --> 01:02:51.360
Oh, Abraham is his name.

01:02:51.360 --> 01:02:53.360
Gladly accepted that.

01:02:53.360 --> 01:02:56.360
Oh, Abraham is well done.

01:02:56.360 --> 01:03:01.360
Professor in the field of media ethics.

01:03:01.360 --> 01:03:03.360
He had sadly retired.

01:03:03.360 --> 01:03:05.360
I've got to wait two more days.

01:03:05.360 --> 01:03:08.360
Can you last two more days?

01:03:08.360 --> 01:03:11.360
Yeah, I think you can.

01:03:11.360 --> 01:03:15.360
Be good and wait.

01:03:15.360 --> 01:03:19.360
Did you notice the bomber seems to be closely connected to thought?

01:03:19.360 --> 01:03:22.360
There could be pattern.

01:03:22.360 --> 01:03:25.360
Thought had held three demonstrations.

01:03:25.360 --> 01:03:27.360
Actually, what I've got a bone effect.

01:03:27.360 --> 01:03:29.360
Hold on.

01:03:29.360 --> 01:03:37.360
I've got a bone effect with a certain marshmallow.

01:03:37.360 --> 01:03:40.360
I have a bone effect with a certain marshmallow.

01:03:40.360 --> 01:03:41.360
I'm going to read it out.

01:03:41.360 --> 01:03:42.360
It was so bad.

01:03:42.360 --> 01:03:43.360
I'm reading it out.

01:03:43.360 --> 01:03:45.360
And you know exactly who you are.

01:03:45.360 --> 01:03:47.360
Who fucking sent this.

01:03:47.360 --> 01:03:48.360
Hold on.

01:03:48.360 --> 01:03:49.360
Let me find it.

01:03:49.360 --> 01:03:56.360
Let me find it.

01:03:56.360 --> 01:03:58.360
Where is it?

01:03:58.360 --> 01:03:59.360
Where is it?

01:03:59.360 --> 01:04:02.360
It was a recent one.

01:04:02.360 --> 01:04:03.360
That's right.

01:04:03.360 --> 01:04:05.360
You're in trouble, Riflin.

01:04:05.360 --> 01:04:06.360
You're in trouble.

01:04:06.360 --> 01:04:10.360
And you know exactly who you are.

01:04:10.360 --> 01:04:12.360
I'm going to read this.

01:04:12.360 --> 01:04:15.360
Because Riflin, you had nothing but the audacity.

01:04:15.360 --> 01:04:17.360
Imagine I'm railing you in your bedroom

01:04:17.360 --> 01:04:20.360
and your dad comes home early and sees me pounding you

01:04:20.360 --> 01:04:22.360
and slapping your cheeks while you scream harder.

01:04:22.360 --> 01:04:24.360
With that end, okay?

01:04:24.360 --> 01:04:27.360
What if he sees the creation of her child, his grandchild?

01:04:27.360 --> 01:04:28.360
How embarrassing.

01:04:28.360 --> 01:04:30.360
I'd be so ashamed, Lamal.

01:04:30.360 --> 01:04:33.360
Riflin, who the fuck sent that?

01:04:33.360 --> 01:04:37.360
Who sent that with their whole chest?

01:04:37.360 --> 01:04:44.360
Who formulated those letters?

01:04:44.360 --> 01:04:47.360
Which one of you did that?

01:04:47.360 --> 01:04:51.360
I know you're cackling behind the keyboard right now.

01:04:51.360 --> 01:04:58.360
If I ever, if I ever spot you at a convention,

01:04:58.360 --> 01:05:08.360
if I ever, your left ball is getting upped.

01:05:08.360 --> 01:05:11.360
I don't remember sending that now.

01:05:11.360 --> 01:05:14.360
Absolutely not.

01:05:14.360 --> 01:05:15.360
Right.

01:05:15.360 --> 01:05:17.360
Thought has held three demonstrations,

01:05:17.360 --> 01:05:19.360
yet there has only been two bomba,

01:05:19.360 --> 01:05:22.360
which might imply, well, it's definitely shot in the dark,

01:05:22.360 --> 01:05:24.360
but we absolutely need to do everything we can

01:05:24.360 --> 01:05:25.360
to prevent another attack.

01:05:25.360 --> 01:05:28.360
Take a close look at the path of each member with thought.

01:05:28.360 --> 01:05:31.360
Find out the locations of all demonstrations

01:05:31.360 --> 01:05:33.360
that have held that might yield a hint.

01:05:33.360 --> 01:05:36.360
Why only the left one?

01:05:36.360 --> 01:05:37.360
Because I need to pick on one.

01:05:37.360 --> 01:05:38.360
It was either left or right.

01:05:38.360 --> 01:05:40.360
I'll pick on your left ball instead.

01:05:40.360 --> 01:05:41.360
She pops your left ball.

01:05:41.360 --> 01:05:42.360
You'll never have a daughter.

01:05:42.360 --> 01:05:43.360
That's how it works, right?

01:05:43.360 --> 01:05:44.360
No!

01:05:44.360 --> 01:05:46.360
Thought it all works at all.

01:05:46.360 --> 01:05:47.360
That's funny.

01:05:47.360 --> 01:05:48.360
Okay.

01:05:48.360 --> 01:05:51.360
Journalist at Der Reporter.

01:05:51.360 --> 01:05:52.360
One of the most...

01:05:52.360 --> 01:05:53.360
Oh, it's German.

01:05:53.360 --> 01:05:54.360
Sorry.

01:05:54.360 --> 01:05:55.360
Like Der.

01:05:55.360 --> 01:05:59.360
You lose one chromosome that you can pass over.

01:05:59.360 --> 01:06:00.360
Okay.

01:06:00.360 --> 01:06:01.360
Formula G.

01:06:01.360 --> 01:06:03.360
And was also chairman of Global Media...

01:06:03.360 --> 01:06:07.360
Man, this guy has quite the portfolio on him.

01:06:07.360 --> 01:06:08.360
Jeez.

01:06:08.360 --> 01:06:10.360
Chairman of an ethical congress,

01:06:10.360 --> 01:06:13.360
just to average one of the mill.

01:06:13.360 --> 01:06:15.360
Steady on sims.

01:06:15.360 --> 01:06:18.360
I think you've been a bit radicalized yourself, mate.

01:06:18.360 --> 01:06:21.360
Wow, that's a whole lot of information about this fella.

01:06:21.360 --> 01:06:25.360
Yet, only one other page could be indexed.

01:06:25.360 --> 01:06:27.360
Very strange indeed.

01:06:27.360 --> 01:06:32.360
I think the next course of action should be to look for other people of this group,

01:06:32.360 --> 01:06:35.360
like the students he mentioned.

01:06:35.360 --> 01:06:36.360
Thoughts are free.

01:06:36.360 --> 01:06:37.360
Oh, okay.

01:06:37.360 --> 01:06:39.360
This is another link.

01:06:39.360 --> 01:06:43.360
A modern time declaration of independence towards mass surveillance.

01:06:43.360 --> 01:06:44.360
Cure it.

01:06:44.360 --> 01:06:47.360
Your genes become joints.

01:06:47.360 --> 01:06:49.360
Well, what do you say to that?

01:06:49.360 --> 01:06:51.360
He literally wrote the book.

01:06:51.360 --> 01:06:52.360
Well, yeah.

01:06:52.360 --> 01:06:54.360
Okay, what's the headline?

01:06:54.360 --> 01:06:55.360
Breaking news.

01:06:55.360 --> 01:06:57.360
First suspect in connection.

01:06:57.360 --> 01:06:58.360
Who?

01:06:58.360 --> 01:07:00.360
Women arrested in connection.

01:07:00.360 --> 01:07:03.360
Oh, okay.

01:07:03.360 --> 01:07:06.360
They've broken the news, right?

01:07:06.360 --> 01:07:07.360
What's going on?

01:07:07.360 --> 01:07:10.360
Whoa, there's like a lot of new information on this page.

01:07:10.360 --> 01:07:11.360
Home.

01:07:11.360 --> 01:07:13.360
What's new on it?

01:07:14.360 --> 01:07:19.360
Wait, did I not just...

01:07:19.360 --> 01:07:20.360
There's nothing new on this.

01:07:20.360 --> 01:07:23.360
I'm being trolled.

01:07:23.360 --> 01:07:26.360
Oh, these are students.

01:07:26.360 --> 01:07:29.360
Did I need to interact with them?

01:07:29.360 --> 01:07:31.360
Because I said I needed to get students.

01:07:31.360 --> 01:07:34.360
I bet he stopped leading the group and one of his radicals took over.

01:07:34.360 --> 01:07:38.360
I am leaving that too.

01:07:38.360 --> 01:07:40.360
Why can I not interact with them?

01:07:40.360 --> 01:07:42.360
Maybe I interact with the later stage.

01:07:42.360 --> 01:07:43.360
Attendee list.

01:07:43.360 --> 01:07:44.360
Okay.

01:07:44.360 --> 01:07:46.360
I don't know where you found that.

01:07:46.360 --> 01:07:48.360
Summer?

01:07:54.360 --> 01:07:56.360
Wait, where's his class?

01:08:00.360 --> 01:08:03.360
I'm freaking to say I'm actually going to have to use my head.

01:08:03.360 --> 01:08:04.360
Hold on.

01:08:04.360 --> 01:08:05.360
Hold on.

01:08:05.360 --> 01:08:06.360
Right.

01:08:06.360 --> 01:08:08.360
What was his class again?

01:08:08.360 --> 01:08:10.360
Media Ethics.

01:08:12.360 --> 01:08:13.360
Okay.

01:08:13.360 --> 01:08:15.360
Okay, take me to the list.

01:08:15.360 --> 01:08:17.360
Winter.

01:08:17.360 --> 01:08:19.360
Media.

01:08:19.360 --> 01:08:20.360
And then what's his name again?

01:08:20.360 --> 01:08:22.360
Big...

01:08:22.360 --> 01:08:24.360
Big Gold Felt.

01:08:24.360 --> 01:08:25.360
I would be terrible at this job.

01:08:25.360 --> 01:08:26.360
I already forget the names.

01:08:26.360 --> 01:08:27.360
Right.

01:08:27.360 --> 01:08:30.360
I think you're already retired at this point, so you don't count.

01:08:30.360 --> 01:08:31.360
Okay.

01:08:31.360 --> 01:08:32.360
So then go Previous.

01:08:32.360 --> 01:08:34.360
Then go Summer.

01:08:34.360 --> 01:08:36.360
Then go Media.

01:08:36.360 --> 01:08:38.360
And then look for Gold Fells.

01:08:38.360 --> 01:08:39.360
Gold Fells.

01:08:39.360 --> 01:08:41.360
Abraham.

01:08:43.360 --> 01:08:45.360
Nothing's been highlighted.

01:08:45.360 --> 01:08:46.360
Oh.

01:08:47.360 --> 01:08:49.360
Juliet.

01:08:49.360 --> 01:08:51.360
Ooh.

01:08:51.360 --> 01:08:53.360
Juliet.

01:08:53.360 --> 01:08:55.360
We're seeing that name before, haven't we?

01:08:55.360 --> 01:08:56.360
Right.

01:08:56.360 --> 01:08:57.360
She was a friend of Miss Wargate.

01:08:57.360 --> 01:08:59.360
Now it appears that she's a student.

01:08:59.360 --> 01:09:00.360
I think that's enough to warrant a report.

01:09:00.360 --> 01:09:02.360
Give me a few minutes.

01:09:02.360 --> 01:09:05.360
Alright, we have authorization to investigate her.

01:09:06.360 --> 01:09:07.360
Oh.

01:09:07.360 --> 01:09:08.360
Okay, we have a profile now.

01:09:08.360 --> 01:09:10.360
O'Donnell Harrison.

01:09:12.360 --> 01:09:14.360
What's that then, too?

01:09:15.360 --> 01:09:18.360
Joseph Lang is Cassandra's boyfriend and on the

01:09:18.360 --> 01:09:20.360
Illumini list.

01:09:20.360 --> 01:09:22.360
Ooh, I didn't spot that.

01:09:22.360 --> 01:09:23.360
Harrison O'Donnell.

01:09:23.360 --> 01:09:25.360
Yes, we have seen that name as well.

01:09:25.360 --> 01:09:26.360
I'll report this right away.

01:09:26.360 --> 01:09:28.360
Yes, yes.

01:09:28.360 --> 01:09:30.360
We have been authorized to consider Harrison.

01:09:30.360 --> 01:09:33.360
Oh, that was the gorilla guy.

01:09:33.360 --> 01:09:36.360
Now there's some more work for you.

01:09:36.360 --> 01:09:37.360
Congrats.

01:09:37.360 --> 01:09:38.360
Okay.

01:09:38.360 --> 01:09:41.360
Harrison and Juliet, they must be students within

01:09:41.360 --> 01:09:42.360
Thought.

01:09:42.360 --> 01:09:43.360
Well done.

01:09:43.360 --> 01:09:44.360
Okay.

01:09:44.360 --> 01:09:45.360
Anyone else?

01:09:45.360 --> 01:09:47.360
Nicholas Webb.

01:09:47.360 --> 01:09:48.360
Wheeler.

01:09:48.360 --> 01:09:50.360
William.

01:09:50.360 --> 01:09:51.360
Right.

01:09:51.360 --> 01:09:53.360
Oh, we've got their timelines.

01:09:53.360 --> 01:09:54.360
Okay.

01:09:54.360 --> 01:09:56.360
First profile picture.

01:09:57.360 --> 01:09:59.360
Next.

01:09:59.360 --> 01:10:01.360
Your job, which is a PR assistant at

01:10:01.360 --> 01:10:03.360
Rosen Tech.

01:10:03.360 --> 01:10:05.360
Your birthday is February,

01:10:05.360 --> 01:10:07.360
1992.

01:10:07.360 --> 01:10:09.360
God, we even have your location.

01:10:09.360 --> 01:10:11.360
This is too easy, bro.

01:10:11.360 --> 01:10:12.360
Okay.

01:10:12.360 --> 01:10:13.360
Fair view.

01:10:13.360 --> 01:10:14.360
We even got location.

01:10:14.360 --> 01:10:16.360
Interest, guitar singing, board games.

01:10:16.360 --> 01:10:18.360
It's not really necessary.

01:10:18.360 --> 01:10:21.360
I mean, I guess I'll just take it because it's a

01:10:21.360 --> 01:10:22.360
wee thing.

01:10:22.360 --> 01:10:25.360
It's not really that interesting.

01:10:27.360 --> 01:10:30.360
Ha, you can dance and I got the proof now.

01:10:30.360 --> 01:10:32.360
Oh, is that really me?

01:10:32.360 --> 01:10:34.360
I'm going to be careful around you apparently.

01:10:34.360 --> 01:10:35.360
Great photo though.

01:10:35.360 --> 01:10:36.360
You took it.

01:10:36.360 --> 01:10:37.360
Nice try, Jules.

01:10:37.360 --> 01:10:39.360
A magician never reveals her trick.

01:10:42.360 --> 01:10:44.360
Anyway, thanks for a great time.

01:10:44.360 --> 01:10:47.360
I must admit, it felt kind of good to go out for once.

01:10:47.360 --> 01:10:50.360
Not that I plan on doing it again any time soon.

01:10:50.360 --> 01:10:53.360
Well, every time I ask you out, you still go out that busy

01:10:53.360 --> 01:10:56.360
and then you fall for freaking muffins.

01:10:56.360 --> 01:10:59.360
Wait, did he just call the blue here when a muffin?

01:11:01.360 --> 01:11:02.360
Sorry, Adam.

01:11:02.360 --> 01:11:04.360
Maybe you need to spy on me somewhere.

01:11:05.360 --> 01:11:06.360
Oh, okay.

01:11:06.360 --> 01:11:07.360
That was rather random.

01:11:07.360 --> 01:11:09.360
I've got to go walk the dog.

01:11:09.360 --> 01:11:10.360
Okay.

01:11:10.360 --> 01:11:11.360
Where's my collar?

01:11:11.360 --> 01:11:12.360
Put on me.

01:11:14.360 --> 01:11:16.360
Sorry, that was really cringe.

01:11:16.360 --> 01:11:17.360
Even I made myself grimace there.

01:11:17.360 --> 01:11:19.360
I was like, ooh, steady on.

01:11:19.360 --> 01:11:20.360
I'm bored to death.

01:11:20.360 --> 01:11:22.360
I'm making cupcakes.

01:11:22.360 --> 01:11:24.360
That girl next door.

01:11:25.360 --> 01:11:27.360
You know, I'm not so keen on going out late.

01:11:27.360 --> 01:11:29.360
Plus, I don't dance.

01:11:29.360 --> 01:11:30.360
Okay, no.

01:11:31.360 --> 01:11:32.360
All right, all right.

01:11:32.360 --> 01:11:34.360
You're going to be there tortured by my girlfriend.

01:11:34.360 --> 01:11:35.360
No.

01:11:35.360 --> 01:11:37.360
Oh, friend, engaged in torture.

01:11:37.360 --> 01:11:38.360
No.

01:11:38.360 --> 01:11:39.360
No.

01:11:39.360 --> 01:11:40.360
Don't be silly.

01:11:40.360 --> 01:11:42.360
The pet play allegations.

01:11:42.360 --> 01:11:43.360
Wait.

01:11:43.360 --> 01:11:45.360
Someone said all of us are in on that.

01:11:45.360 --> 01:11:47.360
And I'm like, is Azura in on that?

01:11:47.360 --> 01:11:50.360
I didn't think Azura had anything to do with pet play.

01:11:53.360 --> 01:11:56.360
Ooh, I actually needed to ask you.

01:11:56.360 --> 01:11:59.360
I was going to order a collar and a bowl,

01:11:59.360 --> 01:12:01.360
but I don't know if I put wreathling on it,

01:12:01.360 --> 01:12:03.360
like your name on it.

01:12:04.360 --> 01:12:06.360
I put wreathling on that and then it's like

01:12:06.360 --> 01:12:08.360
I'm property of wreathling.

01:12:08.360 --> 01:12:11.360
Or do I need to put my name on it?

01:12:11.360 --> 01:12:13.360
I don't know how it works.

01:12:15.360 --> 01:12:17.360
Put wreathling on the bowl.

01:12:17.360 --> 01:12:18.360
Okay.

01:12:19.360 --> 01:12:21.360
Okay, so I put your name on it

01:12:21.360 --> 01:12:23.360
because you own me.

01:12:23.360 --> 01:12:25.360
Okay, got it, got it, got it, got it.

01:12:25.360 --> 01:12:26.360
Happy birthday, honey.

01:12:26.360 --> 01:12:28.360
So glad to have you back.

01:12:28.360 --> 01:12:31.360
We are the Kerrytons.

01:12:31.360 --> 01:12:33.360
Welcome to our website.

01:12:33.360 --> 01:12:36.360
Ooh, look at all these people.

01:12:36.360 --> 01:12:38.360
Oh, she's having a good time.

01:12:39.360 --> 01:12:40.360
Sushi.

01:12:40.360 --> 01:12:41.360
Oh, I'm hungry now.

01:12:41.360 --> 01:12:42.360
Whoa.

01:12:43.360 --> 01:12:46.360
Whoa, she got more of her thing there.

01:12:46.360 --> 01:12:48.360
Yeah, because you're not dumb enough to do the opposite.

01:12:48.360 --> 01:12:50.360
Azura would be the owner in anything.

01:12:50.360 --> 01:12:52.360
Put ink jar on it.

01:12:52.360 --> 01:12:54.360
Okay, I'll order my little doggy bowl

01:12:54.360 --> 01:12:56.360
and my collar.

01:12:56.360 --> 01:12:58.360
Her favorite color is red.

01:12:58.360 --> 01:13:00.360
She likes playing a guitar

01:13:00.360 --> 01:13:01.360
to kill a mockingbird.

01:13:01.360 --> 01:13:03.360
I've still not read the other one yet.

01:13:03.360 --> 01:13:05.360
Since the nestling of the family

01:13:05.360 --> 01:13:06.360
showed up a little bit, the parents,

01:13:06.360 --> 01:13:07.360
John and...

01:13:07.360 --> 01:13:10.360
Okay, so we have father and mother.

01:13:10.360 --> 01:13:12.360
Decided that they would end

01:13:12.360 --> 01:13:15.360
the strictness of naming pattern her sister.

01:13:15.360 --> 01:13:16.360
Juliet played guitar.

01:13:16.360 --> 01:13:17.360
Yeah, we get it.

01:13:17.360 --> 01:13:20.360
She decided to enter band career

01:13:20.360 --> 01:13:23.360
once she was single again.

01:13:24.360 --> 01:13:25.360
There's a conf...

01:13:25.360 --> 01:13:27.360
And focus on her university studies.

01:13:27.360 --> 01:13:29.360
So we have undeniable proof

01:13:29.360 --> 01:13:32.360
that she was in the class of that guy.

01:13:33.360 --> 01:13:35.360
We just need to find this conflicting date.

01:13:35.360 --> 01:13:37.360
And we'll find this part of it.

01:13:39.360 --> 01:13:41.360
I feel like you don't want us wearing tinfoil

01:13:41.360 --> 01:13:43.360
considering your plot.

01:13:44.360 --> 01:13:45.360
Red might be important

01:13:45.360 --> 01:13:48.360
if the letter is written in a certain color.

01:13:51.360 --> 01:13:52.360
What's she doing?

01:13:52.360 --> 01:13:54.360
Nobody...

01:13:54.360 --> 01:13:55.360
Nobody took notice.

01:13:55.360 --> 01:13:57.360
Nobody cares, nobody.

01:13:57.360 --> 01:13:59.360
What did Harry do this time?

01:14:00.360 --> 01:14:02.360
Ooh, she's dating Harry.

01:14:02.360 --> 01:14:03.360
Even though Cassandra and I

01:14:03.360 --> 01:14:05.360
just got to know each other as a protest,

01:14:05.360 --> 01:14:06.360
she stood up for me.

01:14:06.360 --> 01:14:08.360
Okay, so we have...

01:14:08.360 --> 01:14:11.360
We have proof that they also met as well.

01:14:12.360 --> 01:14:15.360
This woman is a hero and not a terrorist.

01:14:16.360 --> 01:14:18.360
Rick Denton?

01:14:19.360 --> 01:14:21.360
How come you care so much about politics now?

01:14:23.360 --> 01:14:25.360
This doesn't sound like the Juliet.

01:14:25.360 --> 01:14:26.360
I know.

01:14:26.360 --> 01:14:27.360
You wouldn't even accept

01:14:27.360 --> 01:14:29.360
the Juliet being class representative.

01:14:29.360 --> 01:14:31.360
How come you care so much about politics?

01:14:32.360 --> 01:14:33.360
And go for it.

01:14:33.360 --> 01:14:35.360
Sometimes people change their minds.

01:14:38.360 --> 01:14:40.360
First Miss Watergate and now hers.

01:14:40.360 --> 01:14:42.360
There's some sort of brainwashing going on.

01:14:43.360 --> 01:14:44.360
I understand.

01:14:44.360 --> 01:14:45.360
Strongly.

01:14:45.360 --> 01:14:46.360
The high table.

01:14:49.360 --> 01:14:51.360
That's not funny.

01:14:52.360 --> 01:14:54.360
Ooh, this guy's a bit more smart

01:14:54.360 --> 01:14:56.360
with his information.

01:14:58.360 --> 01:14:59.360
Harrison, we've got a picture of him.

01:14:59.360 --> 01:15:01.360
He says Media Punk, though.

01:15:02.360 --> 01:15:03.360
Sure.

01:15:03.360 --> 01:15:05.360
We'll put that as your occupation

01:15:05.360 --> 01:15:06.360
for now.

01:15:06.360 --> 01:15:07.360
Media Punk.

01:15:08.360 --> 01:15:09.360
Media Punk.

01:15:09.360 --> 01:15:10.360
What does that even mean?

01:15:10.360 --> 01:15:11.360
This is being deleted.

01:15:11.360 --> 01:15:13.360
Deleted multiple posts.

01:15:13.360 --> 01:15:14.360
Ooh.

01:15:16.360 --> 01:15:17.360
Ooh.

01:15:18.360 --> 01:15:19.360
Do we have something to hide,

01:15:19.360 --> 01:15:20.360
Mr. O'Donnell?

01:15:22.360 --> 01:15:23.360
Always hiding everything.

01:15:23.360 --> 01:15:24.360
Ooh.

01:15:25.360 --> 01:15:27.360
You got this couple rock the show

01:15:27.360 --> 01:15:29.360
as it will rock the rest

01:15:29.360 --> 01:15:31.360
of the goddamn nation.

01:15:31.360 --> 01:15:33.360
Well, you've posted proof

01:15:33.360 --> 01:15:35.360
that you were with the other girl.

01:15:35.360 --> 01:15:37.360
Juliet is a, yeah.

01:15:37.360 --> 01:15:39.360
Our two student members of Thought

01:15:39.360 --> 01:15:41.360
are a couple, interesting.

01:15:43.360 --> 01:15:45.360
Mike, why didn't you go and ask Juliet

01:15:45.360 --> 01:15:46.360
out right away, huh?

01:15:46.360 --> 01:15:47.360
No need for hiding anything.

01:15:47.360 --> 01:15:48.360
No need for hiding anything.

01:15:48.360 --> 01:15:50.360
I can provide a nose correction

01:15:50.360 --> 01:15:53.360
just for you to make you look like a...

01:15:53.360 --> 01:15:54.360
Just...

01:15:54.360 --> 01:15:55.360
You want that?

01:15:55.360 --> 01:15:56.360
No, then Ethel.

01:15:57.360 --> 01:15:58.360
If you got it flunked,

01:15:58.360 --> 01:16:00.360
oh, so he gave a compliment

01:16:00.360 --> 01:16:01.360
and he's coming in region.

01:16:01.360 --> 01:16:02.360
Easily jealous.

01:16:02.360 --> 01:16:04.360
I mean, that's not really

01:16:04.360 --> 01:16:06.360
gonna help find the bomba.

01:16:08.360 --> 01:16:10.360
There we have the connection.

01:16:10.360 --> 01:16:11.360
Connection.

01:16:11.360 --> 01:16:12.360
Yeah.

01:16:13.360 --> 01:16:14.360
Okay, I don't really think it's

01:16:14.360 --> 01:16:15.360
necessary to put in, like,

01:16:15.360 --> 01:16:18.360
the smaller details like that.

01:16:18.360 --> 01:16:19.360
Harrison likes to target

01:16:19.360 --> 01:16:21.360
the haunted house with the cash

01:16:21.360 --> 01:16:23.360
instead of the clash.

01:16:23.360 --> 01:16:25.360
The national beholder.

01:16:25.360 --> 01:16:28.360
We hold the ThunderDome.

01:16:28.360 --> 01:16:29.360
Okay, welcome.

01:16:30.360 --> 01:16:32.360
Rosin Technologies.

01:16:32.360 --> 01:16:33.360
What are you?

01:16:35.360 --> 01:16:37.360
A Rosin is the family.

01:16:37.360 --> 01:16:38.360
Oh, we've got a listen.

01:16:38.360 --> 01:16:39.360
Sorry, we've got a listen.

01:16:39.360 --> 01:16:40.360
Sorry.

01:16:41.360 --> 01:16:43.360
Oh, she got access to her phone.

01:16:46.360 --> 01:16:48.360
What happened yesterday?

01:16:49.360 --> 01:16:51.360
You got yoinked.

01:16:52.360 --> 01:16:54.360
Juliet, this is

01:16:54.360 --> 01:16:56.360
Yosef on Cassandra's account.

01:16:56.360 --> 01:16:58.360
Oh, my God, what?

01:17:01.360 --> 01:17:02.360
Wait,

01:17:02.360 --> 01:17:04.360
did I have a profile on Yosef?

01:17:04.360 --> 01:17:05.360
I must have.

01:17:08.360 --> 01:17:10.360
This is the correct account.

01:17:10.360 --> 01:17:15.360
It's disabled.

01:17:17.360 --> 01:17:18.360
Oh, right.

01:17:18.360 --> 01:17:19.360
I can only do it on her.

01:17:19.360 --> 01:17:20.360
Sorry, I didn't.

01:17:20.360 --> 01:17:21.360
I didn't drop it.

01:17:22.360 --> 01:17:24.360
Not too uncommon in a relationship.

01:17:24.360 --> 01:17:25.360
Oh, sorry.

01:17:25.360 --> 01:17:26.360
Hi.

01:17:26.360 --> 01:17:27.360
Didn't know you had access to her.

01:17:27.360 --> 01:17:29.360
Nice to talk to you too, Juliet.

01:17:29.360 --> 01:17:30.360
Have you seen Cassandra since yesterday?

01:17:30.360 --> 01:17:31.360
Heard from her.

01:17:31.360 --> 01:17:32.360
I spoke to her last night via chat.

01:17:32.360 --> 01:17:33.360
She seemed quite upset

01:17:33.360 --> 01:17:34.360
about the whole plaza thing.

01:17:34.360 --> 01:17:36.360
And something else

01:17:36.360 --> 01:17:37.360
she wouldn't talk about,

01:17:37.360 --> 01:17:39.360
then there was something at her door.

01:17:39.360 --> 01:17:40.360
Someone at her door.

01:17:40.360 --> 01:17:41.360
So she went to answer it

01:17:41.360 --> 01:17:42.360
and never came back.

01:17:42.360 --> 01:17:43.360
I assumed it was you.

01:17:43.360 --> 01:17:44.360
We were supposed to meet for dinner

01:17:44.360 --> 01:17:45.360
but I had an unexpected meeting.

01:17:45.360 --> 01:17:47.360
She wasn't exactly happy

01:17:47.360 --> 01:17:48.360
about the change of plans.

01:17:48.360 --> 01:17:50.360
She quit the chat.

01:17:50.360 --> 01:17:51.360
And that was it.

01:17:51.360 --> 01:17:52.360
I haven't heard from her since.

01:17:52.360 --> 01:17:53.360
In that case,

01:17:53.360 --> 01:17:54.360
I think she's probably home

01:17:54.360 --> 01:17:55.360
stewing away.

01:17:55.360 --> 01:17:56.360
Well, I just tried that.

01:17:56.360 --> 01:17:57.360
She gave me the keyster a flat

01:17:57.360 --> 01:17:58.360
two months ago,

01:17:58.360 --> 01:17:59.360
but no Cassie,

01:17:59.360 --> 01:18:00.360
also her PC was still on.

01:18:00.360 --> 01:18:01.360
Hmm, I guess.

01:18:01.360 --> 01:18:02.360
Calling her didn't work.

01:18:02.360 --> 01:18:03.360
No, I tried.

01:18:03.360 --> 01:18:04.360
Damn, I hate myself right now.

01:18:04.360 --> 01:18:05.360
Did you set your number to private?

01:18:05.360 --> 01:18:06.360
Otherwise, she's probably

01:18:06.360 --> 01:18:07.360
just avoiding you.

01:18:07.360 --> 01:18:08.360
Private is my default

01:18:08.360 --> 01:18:10.360
after all I am a lawyer.

01:18:10.360 --> 01:18:12.360
No, Cassandra's not a lawyer.

01:18:12.360 --> 01:18:13.360
Oh, the fuck,

01:18:13.360 --> 01:18:14.360
ignore that.

01:18:14.360 --> 01:18:16.360
Cassandra's not a lawyer.

01:18:18.360 --> 01:18:20.360
Must be meticulous as possible.

01:18:20.360 --> 01:18:23.360
We will get to the bottom of this.

01:18:23.360 --> 01:18:25.360
When she's mad,

01:18:25.360 --> 01:18:26.360
she usually goes to wonders

01:18:26.360 --> 01:18:27.360
around the city.

01:18:27.360 --> 01:18:28.360
She'll be back in no time.

01:18:28.360 --> 01:18:29.360
Yeah, she does get

01:18:29.360 --> 01:18:31.360
about fiery at times.

01:18:31.360 --> 01:18:32.360
Fireball.

01:18:32.360 --> 01:18:33.360
That doesn't really work

01:18:33.360 --> 01:18:34.360
like wild card.

01:18:34.360 --> 01:18:35.360
There's the refland

01:18:35.360 --> 01:18:37.360
that's been put in wild card.

01:18:37.360 --> 01:18:39.360
In my marshmallow.

01:18:39.360 --> 01:18:40.360
And I'm like,

01:18:40.360 --> 01:18:41.360
okay, that's actually,

01:18:41.360 --> 01:18:42.360
wait a minute,

01:18:42.360 --> 01:18:43.360
do you think this guy's

01:18:43.360 --> 01:18:46.360
one on her account?

01:18:46.360 --> 01:18:48.360
The lawyer's on her account.

01:18:48.360 --> 01:18:49.360
Are you trolling me?

01:18:49.360 --> 01:18:51.360
Are you messing me up on purpose?

01:18:51.360 --> 01:18:53.360
Oh, I doubt that somehow.

01:18:53.360 --> 01:18:54.360
Oh, sorry.

01:18:54.360 --> 01:18:55.360
See, this is why I want to,

01:18:55.360 --> 01:18:56.360
I feel like you know

01:18:56.360 --> 01:18:57.360
are better than I do.

01:18:57.360 --> 01:18:59.360
And I'm the boyfriend.

01:18:59.360 --> 01:19:00.360
Oh, I doubt that.

01:19:00.360 --> 01:19:01.360
I mean, you two were

01:19:01.360 --> 01:19:03.360
at the plaza together.

01:19:03.360 --> 01:19:04.360
And so I thought maybe

01:19:04.360 --> 01:19:06.360
you'd know other places

01:19:06.360 --> 01:19:09.360
that could be important to her.

01:19:09.360 --> 01:19:10.360
I'm sorry, freedom plaza

01:19:10.360 --> 01:19:12.360
was organized by thought.

01:19:12.360 --> 01:19:13.360
Yeah, but Harrison

01:19:13.360 --> 01:19:15.360
did all the planning.

01:19:15.360 --> 01:19:17.360
What's the conflict?

01:19:17.360 --> 01:19:18.360
I must know.

01:19:18.360 --> 01:19:19.360
You must let me know

01:19:19.360 --> 01:19:23.360
the conflict.

01:19:23.360 --> 01:19:26.360
I must find the conflict.

01:19:26.360 --> 01:19:28.360
Harrison did the planning,

01:19:28.360 --> 01:19:30.360
apparently,

01:19:30.360 --> 01:19:32.360
as our little gorilla's

01:19:32.360 --> 01:19:35.360
listener wild card is.

01:19:35.360 --> 01:19:36.360
Thank you.

01:19:36.360 --> 01:19:37.360
Anyway, session closed.

01:19:37.360 --> 01:19:38.360
Right.

01:19:38.360 --> 01:19:42.360
So we need to find the conflict.

01:19:42.360 --> 01:19:47.360
The Ten Commandments.

01:19:47.360 --> 01:19:48.360
Okay.

01:19:48.360 --> 01:19:49.360
I was like,

01:19:49.360 --> 01:19:54.360
Serion, what's going on here?

01:19:54.360 --> 01:19:57.360
Oh, we've got a phone number.

01:19:57.360 --> 01:20:02.360
Oh, Julie.

01:20:02.360 --> 01:20:04.360
Gate card.

01:20:04.360 --> 01:20:06.360
Well, good work.

01:20:06.360 --> 01:20:07.360
The listener will also track

01:20:07.360 --> 01:20:09.360
incoming, outgoing telephone

01:20:09.360 --> 01:20:12.360
calls of numbers you've added.

01:20:12.360 --> 01:20:14.360
It's not really that farfetched,

01:20:14.360 --> 01:20:17.360
is it?

01:20:17.360 --> 01:20:20.360
Oh.

01:20:20.360 --> 01:20:23.360
Did we get to hear voices?

01:20:23.360 --> 01:20:24.360
Oh, no.

01:20:24.360 --> 01:20:26.360
Welcome to Brusenthek.

01:20:26.360 --> 01:20:29.360
This is the PR assistant, Juliet.

01:20:29.360 --> 01:20:31.360
How can I be a servant?

01:20:31.360 --> 01:20:33.360
Hello, this is Esther.

01:20:33.360 --> 01:20:34.360
You sound so official at work.

01:20:34.360 --> 01:20:35.360
Oh, hi, Mom.

01:20:35.360 --> 01:20:36.360
What's up?

01:20:36.360 --> 01:20:38.360
How's that going in?

01:20:38.360 --> 01:20:40.360
The Harrison character's looking

01:20:40.360 --> 01:20:41.360
sus as anything.

01:20:41.360 --> 01:20:43.360
I have to agree.

01:20:43.360 --> 01:20:45.360
I am going home for it lives

01:20:45.360 --> 01:20:46.360
with her parents.

01:20:46.360 --> 01:20:47.360
Okay.

01:20:47.360 --> 01:20:49.360
So when we take her down,

01:20:49.360 --> 01:20:50.360
we need to remember the parents

01:20:50.360 --> 01:20:51.360
when actually I'm heading out

01:20:51.360 --> 01:20:53.360
with some friends.

01:20:53.360 --> 01:20:57.360
Now let's find her parents address.

01:20:57.360 --> 01:20:58.360
She plans on going abroad.

01:20:58.360 --> 01:21:00.360
Sure, you can make plans

01:21:00.360 --> 01:21:02.360
go for it.

01:21:02.360 --> 01:21:03.360
Now I'm back.

01:21:03.360 --> 01:21:04.360
How's the case going?

01:21:04.360 --> 01:21:08.360
Ah, Juliet is apparently broken up

01:21:08.360 --> 01:21:12.360
with the guy that planned it.

01:21:12.360 --> 01:21:14.360
Honey, please, you won't have much

01:21:14.360 --> 01:21:16.360
freedom left if you're passed away.

01:21:16.360 --> 01:21:18.360
Mom, I won't die.

01:21:18.360 --> 01:21:20.360
How can you be so sure of that?

01:21:20.360 --> 01:21:22.360
I could just as easily be hit by a car

01:21:22.360 --> 01:21:23.360
on the way home.

01:21:23.360 --> 01:21:25.360
Don't say that.

01:21:25.360 --> 01:21:27.360
Just think this ridiculous grip

01:21:27.360 --> 01:21:30.360
I've gotten you into nothing but trouble.

01:21:30.360 --> 01:21:31.360
Alright.

01:21:31.360 --> 01:21:32.360
Sheesh.

01:21:32.360 --> 01:21:33.360
Thank you, honey.

01:21:33.360 --> 01:21:35.360
Mom, I'm sorry.

01:21:35.360 --> 01:21:36.360
But I really have to go.

01:21:36.360 --> 01:21:39.360
I don't want to be fired by my boss,

01:21:39.360 --> 01:21:41.360
Victor Rothen.

01:21:41.360 --> 01:21:42.360
I have to go.

01:21:42.360 --> 01:21:43.360
I'm sorry.

01:21:43.360 --> 01:21:44.360
Love you.

01:21:44.360 --> 01:21:45.360
Bye-bye.

01:21:45.360 --> 01:21:46.360
Curious, curious.

01:21:46.360 --> 01:21:47.360
Okay.

01:21:47.360 --> 01:21:49.360
So we have a boss, which is fine.

01:21:49.360 --> 01:21:52.360
We're allowed to have bosses.

01:21:52.360 --> 01:21:54.360
Huh?

01:21:54.360 --> 01:21:56.360
Wait, what the actual...

01:21:56.360 --> 01:21:58.360
The moment you open the dock,

01:21:58.360 --> 01:21:59.360
well, this is...

01:21:59.360 --> 01:22:02.360
Code Injection was detected in Orwell.

01:22:02.360 --> 01:22:04.360
We've had 47 attack warnings

01:22:04.360 --> 01:22:07.360
and still counting what is on that site.

01:22:07.360 --> 01:22:08.360
Okay, okay.

01:22:08.360 --> 01:22:09.360
Let's get off it.

01:22:09.360 --> 01:22:12.360
So we don't get hacked.

01:22:12.360 --> 01:22:15.360
We got malware.

01:22:15.360 --> 01:22:17.360
Band, we are track.

01:22:17.360 --> 01:22:20.360
We are the track you are ashamed of

01:22:20.360 --> 01:22:22.360
in your fine-tuned playlist.

01:22:22.360 --> 01:22:24.360
Oh, okay, that's funny.

01:22:24.360 --> 01:22:25.360
Okay, hold on.

01:22:25.360 --> 01:22:27.360
We're getting somewhere with this guy.

01:22:27.360 --> 01:22:29.360
He cannot run away from us.

01:22:29.360 --> 01:22:34.360
His name is Hancock.

01:22:34.360 --> 01:22:36.360
The cogs are turning in my head.

01:22:36.360 --> 01:22:37.360
If I had enough sleep,

01:22:37.360 --> 01:22:40.360
I already would have said something wildly inappropriate.

01:22:40.360 --> 01:22:45.360
Oh, that's quite the ego we've got there, haven't we?

01:22:45.360 --> 01:22:47.360
Here's a wee photo of ya.

01:22:47.360 --> 01:22:48.360
Upload.

01:22:48.360 --> 01:22:51.360
Yeah.

01:22:51.360 --> 01:22:53.360
That one looks more complimentary.

01:22:53.360 --> 01:22:55.360
Warmer members.

01:22:55.360 --> 01:22:57.360
Juliet.

01:22:57.360 --> 01:22:58.360
Wrong profile.

01:22:58.360 --> 01:22:59.360
But that's okay,

01:22:59.360 --> 01:23:01.360
because we have Juliet.

01:23:01.360 --> 01:23:04.360
Mummy downloaded the popcorn.

01:23:04.360 --> 01:23:05.360
They got me.

01:23:05.360 --> 01:23:07.360
See, that's what happens if you don't have a pie hole.

01:23:07.360 --> 01:23:09.360
Wait, that's just that picture flipped.

01:23:09.360 --> 01:23:11.360
The other way.

01:23:11.360 --> 01:23:12.360
No.

01:23:12.360 --> 01:23:13.360
Right, okay.

01:23:13.360 --> 01:23:14.360
Let's do the professional one.

01:23:14.360 --> 01:23:15.360
Nah, okay.

01:23:15.360 --> 01:23:16.360
No.

01:23:16.360 --> 01:23:17.360
Dude, the flipped one.

01:23:17.360 --> 01:23:18.360
Sorry.

01:23:18.360 --> 01:23:20.360
I know it doesn't even matter,

01:23:20.360 --> 01:23:21.360
but I didn't find it.

01:23:21.360 --> 01:23:22.360
Right, gigs.

01:23:22.360 --> 01:23:23.360
Where are they playing?

01:23:23.360 --> 01:23:25.360
I want to see them.

01:23:25.360 --> 01:23:30.360
The target's featuring tearing down his cancel.

01:23:30.360 --> 01:23:32.360
He decided to quit.

01:23:32.360 --> 01:23:34.360
A friend of mine claims he heard that he quit,

01:23:34.360 --> 01:23:36.360
but no official statements be given out.

01:23:36.360 --> 01:23:39.360
A whole hearted thumbs down.

01:23:39.360 --> 01:23:42.360
Oh, boo, thumbs down, boo.

01:23:42.360 --> 01:23:44.360
Fucking thumbs down.

01:23:44.360 --> 01:23:46.360
Okay, I'm not going to report that,

01:23:46.360 --> 01:23:50.360
because that was a claim.

01:23:50.360 --> 01:23:51.360
The cell.

01:23:51.360 --> 01:23:54.360
We'll definitely come to Freedom Plot.

01:23:54.360 --> 01:23:55.360
I just have to get to know Juliet,

01:23:55.360 --> 01:23:58.360
especially since she's the one organizing.

01:23:58.360 --> 01:24:11.360
Well, so Cassandra claims that Juliet did it,

01:24:11.360 --> 01:24:12.360
but I'm going to be honest,

01:24:12.360 --> 01:24:14.360
Juliet isn't striking me.

01:24:14.360 --> 01:24:16.360
We'll definitely come.

01:24:16.360 --> 01:24:19.360
I have to go because Juliet is doing a show conflict.

01:24:19.360 --> 01:24:29.360
And so I thought maybe no other places should be important to her.

01:24:29.360 --> 01:24:31.360
I was organized by thought,

01:24:31.360 --> 01:24:40.360
yeah, but Harrison did all the planning.

01:24:40.360 --> 01:24:44.360
I want to say Harrison did it.

01:24:44.360 --> 01:24:47.360
Yeah, because she doesn't have a clue where else she might be.

01:24:47.360 --> 01:24:48.360
I'm going to say Harrison did it.

01:24:48.360 --> 01:24:51.360
I might regret this, but I don't know.

01:24:51.360 --> 01:24:52.360
From the two conflicts,

01:24:52.360 --> 01:24:55.360
it kind of seems like she's just tagging along with him.

01:24:55.360 --> 01:24:58.360
He planned the protest that went completely awry.

01:24:58.360 --> 01:24:59.360
He doesn't sound like,

01:24:59.360 --> 01:25:02.360
doesn't sound like a good plan into me.

01:25:02.360 --> 01:25:05.360
I bet you were going to say Hancock up at my house.

01:25:05.360 --> 01:25:08.360
No, I couldn't come up with the funny enough joke.

01:25:08.360 --> 01:25:10.360
Or maybe it didn't go awry at all.

01:25:10.360 --> 01:25:13.360
Maybe it went down exactly as he had in mind.

01:25:13.360 --> 01:25:15.360
We'll have done it now.

01:25:15.360 --> 01:25:18.360
That Freedom Plaza demonstration was one of thought's protest,

01:25:18.360 --> 01:25:20.360
not in surprise.

01:25:20.360 --> 01:25:23.360
One down, two more locations to go.

01:25:23.360 --> 01:25:26.360
Oh, what have we got?

01:25:26.360 --> 01:25:28.360
No, not another phone call.

01:25:28.360 --> 01:25:31.360
Oh, they're talking to each other.

01:25:31.360 --> 01:25:33.360
Ring ring, hello.

01:25:33.360 --> 01:25:35.360
You've got a Donald.

01:25:35.360 --> 01:25:36.360
Harrison, it's me.

01:25:36.360 --> 01:25:39.360
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, look who it is.

01:25:39.360 --> 01:25:41.360
I know this moment is coming to you.

01:25:41.360 --> 01:25:43.360
But you've caught me by surprise.

01:25:43.360 --> 01:25:45.360
I've already got a handle on it.

01:25:45.360 --> 01:25:46.360
Shh, Juliet.

01:25:46.360 --> 01:25:49.360
Ever since we first made out on that night,

01:25:49.360 --> 01:25:50.360
I knew it was...

01:25:50.360 --> 01:25:53.360
Oh, no, he's a stalker.

01:25:58.360 --> 01:26:00.360
Will you please spare me?

01:26:00.360 --> 01:26:02.360
I didn't believe you, but it really is you.

01:26:02.360 --> 01:26:04.360
Uh, okay.

01:26:04.360 --> 01:26:05.360
Steligan again.

01:26:05.360 --> 01:26:08.360
The university needs to play a major part.

01:26:08.360 --> 01:26:10.360
And what do I owe the beautiful pleasure of your voice?

01:26:10.360 --> 01:26:12.360
You miss me.

01:26:12.360 --> 01:26:15.360
So this is why you did it, to make me call you back again?

01:26:15.360 --> 01:26:17.360
The heck are you talking about?

01:26:17.360 --> 01:26:19.360
Oh, don't play dumb, great administrator.

01:26:19.360 --> 01:26:21.360
I'm talking about the thought page.

01:26:21.360 --> 01:26:23.360
You're so generously volunteered to maintain.

01:26:23.360 --> 01:26:25.360
Wait, give me a sec.

01:26:25.360 --> 01:26:26.360
What the...

01:26:26.360 --> 01:26:28.360
You're messing around with me, Jules.

01:26:28.360 --> 01:26:32.360
Are you seriously trying to say this wasn't your doing?

01:26:32.360 --> 01:26:35.360
Rather eff would I disgrace thought.

01:26:35.360 --> 01:26:40.360
Maybe because the same reason you bailed out of thought all of a sudden.

01:26:41.360 --> 01:26:44.360
Wait, why would you plan it and then bail?

01:26:44.360 --> 01:26:46.360
Thought you didn't...

01:26:46.360 --> 01:26:47.360
Oh, so...

01:26:47.360 --> 01:26:48.360
Oh, is that so?

01:26:48.360 --> 01:26:50.360
We need to keep observing.

01:26:50.360 --> 01:26:51.360
Okay, hold on.

01:26:51.360 --> 01:26:52.360
I can't read that fast.

01:26:52.360 --> 01:26:54.360
Thought you didn't do...

01:26:54.360 --> 01:26:56.360
Since Abe disappeared.

01:26:56.360 --> 01:26:59.360
Disappeared causing thought to come inactive.

01:26:59.360 --> 01:27:00.360
Where does that...

01:27:00.360 --> 01:27:01.360
Who does that go?

01:27:01.360 --> 01:27:03.360
On her?

01:27:03.360 --> 01:27:05.360
Wrong, but wait, what?

01:27:05.360 --> 01:27:07.360
Oh, on Abraham.

01:27:07.360 --> 01:27:09.360
Sorry, on Abraham.

01:27:09.360 --> 01:27:12.360
Okay, so Abe disappeared.

01:27:12.360 --> 01:27:15.360
Perfect voice acting, I'm so sorry.

01:27:15.360 --> 01:27:18.360
Abraham Goh feels disappeared causing the group to be out.

01:27:18.360 --> 01:27:19.360
They're no longer active?

01:27:19.360 --> 01:27:21.360
Well, seems like someone still is.

01:27:21.360 --> 01:27:23.360
To bail on the two of us.

01:27:23.360 --> 01:27:26.360
Former relationship ended...

01:27:26.360 --> 01:27:28.360
Why is that changing?

01:27:28.360 --> 01:27:30.360
Former relationship.

01:27:30.360 --> 01:27:31.360
Wrong profile.

01:27:31.360 --> 01:27:33.360
Sorry.

01:27:33.360 --> 01:27:37.360
Okay, so I'll update for both of them.

01:27:37.360 --> 01:27:38.360
Okay.

01:27:38.360 --> 01:27:40.360
Trouble in paradise.

01:27:40.360 --> 01:27:42.360
Maybe then because you disgraced...

01:27:42.360 --> 01:27:44.360
Hit articles on the blog.

01:27:44.360 --> 01:27:46.360
Oh...

01:27:46.360 --> 01:27:48.360
Except for Cassandra's.

01:27:48.360 --> 01:27:50.360
How's that?

01:27:53.360 --> 01:27:55.360
Curious, need to add that.

01:27:55.360 --> 01:27:58.360
So he hit them on purpose except...

01:27:58.360 --> 01:28:00.360
First the timeline, now the blog.

01:28:00.360 --> 01:28:01.360
You have a lot to hide.

01:28:01.360 --> 01:28:02.360
Hmm.

01:28:02.360 --> 01:28:06.360
Abraham archived the first ones because they didn't want us to know.

01:28:07.360 --> 01:28:11.360
Hit first articles and thought from other members in the public.

01:28:11.360 --> 01:28:14.360
None of us could ever actually, I merely did the same with the rest

01:28:14.360 --> 01:28:16.360
because that would also be in Abe's interest and Cass

01:28:16.360 --> 01:28:21.360
wanted to show her article around.

01:28:21.360 --> 01:28:24.360
What a strange development.

01:28:26.360 --> 01:28:28.360
Oh, that guy that archived.

01:28:28.360 --> 01:28:30.360
This gets more confusing by the minute.

01:28:30.360 --> 01:28:33.360
Why don't you, why do you hide something on a group blog

01:28:33.360 --> 01:28:35.360
from its own members?

01:28:35.360 --> 01:28:36.360
A hidden agenda?

01:28:36.360 --> 01:28:40.360
Oh please, I know you deleted all of your rebellious posts

01:28:40.360 --> 01:28:43.360
to secure your cosy job and writing

01:28:43.360 --> 01:28:49.360
that ridiculous opinion column for the TNB.

01:28:51.360 --> 01:28:54.360
Wait, he writes...

01:28:54.360 --> 01:28:59.360
He writes for the very thing he swore to destroy?

01:29:00.360 --> 01:29:02.360
Hey, I read this one quite...

01:29:02.360 --> 01:29:04.360
It wasn't at all where it was this guy.

01:29:04.360 --> 01:29:06.360
Probably the thing don't know it.

01:29:06.360 --> 01:29:09.360
You know, it's funny you dare speak of disgraces

01:29:09.360 --> 01:29:11.360
when Rossin is the government's personal beat

01:29:11.360 --> 01:29:15.360
because you didn't know, almost makes you the same.

01:29:15.360 --> 01:29:17.360
So you really didn't hack then?

01:29:17.360 --> 01:29:18.360
I didn't have a freaking clue.

01:29:18.360 --> 01:29:20.360
Can you revert the changes?

01:29:20.360 --> 01:29:21.360
You bet.

01:29:21.360 --> 01:29:24.360
I'll even hunt down that son of a...

01:29:24.360 --> 01:29:25.360
Just revert it, okay?

01:29:25.360 --> 01:29:26.360
I don't care who did it.

01:29:26.360 --> 01:29:28.360
I just can't stand her memories being toyed around.

01:29:28.360 --> 01:29:30.360
Okay, okay, I'll be done in a minute, man.

01:29:30.360 --> 01:29:32.360
I never could say no to you.

01:29:32.360 --> 01:29:34.360
Oh, he's like a little puppy dog.

01:29:36.360 --> 01:29:38.360
I will break you like that.

01:29:40.360 --> 01:29:41.360
Okay, right.

01:29:44.360 --> 01:29:46.360
Wait, so why is this red?

01:29:46.360 --> 01:29:48.360
Or is it just red because it's new?

01:29:48.360 --> 01:29:50.360
Probably just because it's new.

01:29:50.360 --> 01:29:51.360
What's the albums?

01:29:53.360 --> 01:29:55.360
I had a punk friend that he is now a real corporal

01:29:55.360 --> 01:29:56.360
working for a bank.

01:29:56.360 --> 01:29:58.360
I cry every time, you know.

01:29:58.360 --> 01:30:00.360
Will we listen to the music?

01:30:04.360 --> 01:30:06.360
Why is it only in my left ear?

01:30:08.360 --> 01:30:10.360
Advertisement for the poor.

01:30:12.360 --> 01:30:14.360
All right, I predict all right.

01:30:14.360 --> 01:30:18.360
Oh, well, we've got an email from him.

01:30:18.360 --> 01:30:20.360
That was literally only in my left ear.

01:30:20.360 --> 01:30:22.360
I'm like, oh, thank you for donating me.

01:30:22.360 --> 01:30:23.360
Excellent.

01:30:24.360 --> 01:30:27.360
We will now have access to any emails coming in and out.

01:30:27.360 --> 01:30:28.360
Oh, what's going on?

01:30:28.360 --> 01:30:29.360
I see you.

01:30:29.360 --> 01:30:31.360
Knock, knock, Harrison seems I caught your pants down

01:30:31.360 --> 01:30:33.360
on that little page of yours.

01:30:33.360 --> 01:30:34.360
Confused, that's fine.

01:30:34.360 --> 01:30:36.360
You don't know me, and I like to keep it that way.

01:30:36.360 --> 01:30:38.360
But I know a lot about you, media punk.

01:30:38.360 --> 01:30:39.360
If I knew...

01:30:39.360 --> 01:30:41.360
Oh, so he got scared.

01:30:41.360 --> 01:30:44.360
If you knew what I know about...

01:30:45.360 --> 01:30:46.360
What?

01:30:46.360 --> 01:30:48.360
If you knew what I know,

01:30:48.360 --> 01:30:52.360
what you know about what this little group of yours did,

01:30:52.360 --> 01:30:56.360
you would find it just as hard to ignore

01:30:56.360 --> 01:31:00.360
that those bomba might be carrying your name tag,

01:31:00.360 --> 01:31:02.360
get what I'm talking about right.

01:31:02.360 --> 01:31:05.360
So the Righteous Hacker initiate

01:31:05.360 --> 01:31:08.360
will expose all information I got on you.

01:31:08.360 --> 01:31:10.360
Might interest the cops.

01:31:10.360 --> 01:31:12.360
I've no love for the government, but I'll do what I must.

01:31:12.360 --> 01:31:14.360
So give me one good reason not to do it.

01:31:16.360 --> 01:31:20.360
He got blackmailed by an anonymous person.

01:31:21.360 --> 01:31:22.360
From initiate.

01:31:22.360 --> 01:31:23.360
Oh, great.

01:31:23.360 --> 01:31:25.360
Now there is a hacker involved in all this

01:31:25.360 --> 01:31:27.360
because the situation wasn't bad enough already.

01:31:27.360 --> 01:31:29.360
I wonder what this is about.

01:31:29.360 --> 01:31:31.360
Let's find out.

01:31:31.360 --> 01:31:33.360
Order confirmation.

01:31:35.360 --> 01:31:37.360
Shoot, Angela?

01:31:37.360 --> 01:31:38.360
Your bank account.

01:31:38.360 --> 01:31:40.360
Okay, give me them bank account numbers.

01:31:40.360 --> 01:31:41.360
Those are mine.

01:31:41.360 --> 01:31:42.360
Those are not yours.

01:31:43.360 --> 01:31:45.360
I don't know if we need a friggin' Angela.

01:31:45.360 --> 01:31:46.360
Harrison sent...

01:31:47.360 --> 01:31:49.360
No one cares about an Angela.

01:31:49.360 --> 01:31:50.360
I see you.

01:31:50.360 --> 01:31:51.360
Hey, wise ass.

01:31:51.360 --> 01:31:53.360
This is the most pathetic attempt I've seen in a long time.

01:31:53.360 --> 01:31:54.360
You want a goddamn reason?

01:31:54.360 --> 01:31:55.360
I'll give you.

01:31:55.360 --> 01:31:56.360
You hacked my site.

01:31:56.360 --> 01:31:57.360
My website.

01:31:57.360 --> 01:31:58.360
Last I checked.

01:31:58.360 --> 01:31:59.360
That's illegal.

01:31:59.360 --> 01:32:00.360
Something about glasshouse and stones.

01:32:00.360 --> 01:32:04.360
I don't get what you want to have found out.

01:32:04.360 --> 01:32:05.360
Oh, my God.

01:32:05.360 --> 01:32:06.360
Am I reading this?

01:32:06.360 --> 01:32:10.360
I don't get what you want to have found out about me.

01:32:10.360 --> 01:32:11.360
True.

01:32:11.360 --> 01:32:12.360
Our protest didn't go as planned,

01:32:12.360 --> 01:32:14.360
but since you claim to know so much about me,

01:32:14.360 --> 01:32:15.360
you shouldn't know.

01:32:15.360 --> 01:32:18.360
That was hardly what I wanted was all in my blog.

01:32:18.360 --> 01:32:20.360
In the blog, I mean.

01:32:21.360 --> 01:32:23.360
It was getting hard to read.

01:32:23.360 --> 01:32:24.360
It's not going well.

01:32:24.360 --> 01:32:26.360
Not worried about the bomba.

01:32:26.360 --> 01:32:27.360
Only grabbing attention.

01:32:27.360 --> 01:32:29.360
Bet you'll be found out, huh?

01:32:29.360 --> 01:32:30.360
With your mad skills.

01:32:30.360 --> 01:32:31.360
Hey, good boy.

01:32:31.360 --> 01:32:33.360
I'll throw you a breadcrumbs so you don't...

01:32:33.360 --> 01:32:34.360
Mine.

01:32:36.360 --> 01:32:37.360
Your dick.

01:32:37.360 --> 01:32:40.360
I'm the wrong person to leave my page alone,

01:32:40.360 --> 01:32:42.360
roll it back, and then don't there touch it.

01:32:42.360 --> 01:32:43.360
Okay, okay, okay.

01:32:43.360 --> 01:32:44.360
Sorry.

01:32:44.360 --> 01:32:45.360
Shy.

01:32:45.360 --> 01:32:46.360
Well, back off.

01:32:46.360 --> 01:32:48.360
Right, why are the gigs highlighted?

01:32:50.360 --> 01:32:52.360
So he quit the band,

01:32:52.360 --> 01:32:53.360
and it's not conflicting,

01:32:53.360 --> 01:32:55.360
so I'll just put he quit the band.

01:32:58.360 --> 01:33:00.360
Internet vigilante easy.

01:33:02.360 --> 01:33:04.360
The national opinion.

01:33:04.360 --> 01:33:06.360
It really is by him.

01:33:11.360 --> 01:33:15.360
There's three conflicting data chunks.

01:33:16.360 --> 01:33:17.360
Oh, God.

01:33:17.360 --> 01:33:18.360
Who knows?

01:33:18.360 --> 01:33:19.360
Maybe the next one will go in the middle.

01:33:19.360 --> 01:33:23.360
Predicted assault at a national museum.

01:33:23.360 --> 01:33:24.360
I mean, we'll put that down

01:33:24.360 --> 01:33:26.360
if he's predicting stuff.

01:33:26.360 --> 01:33:27.360
He's been to the last two.

01:33:27.360 --> 01:33:28.360
Okay.

01:33:28.360 --> 01:33:29.360
Yes, the article.

01:33:29.360 --> 01:33:30.360
That was strange indeed.

01:33:30.360 --> 01:33:31.360
And with the bomba.

01:33:32.360 --> 01:33:33.360
Jeez, Louise.

01:33:33.360 --> 01:33:34.360
Juliet's timeline.

01:33:34.360 --> 01:33:36.360
What's going on with you, Juliet?

01:33:36.360 --> 01:33:38.360
I even organized...

01:33:40.360 --> 01:33:44.360
You organized the peaceful protest on campus.

01:33:46.360 --> 01:33:47.360
Right.

01:33:47.360 --> 01:33:52.360
So Juliet did the campus organization.

01:33:52.360 --> 01:33:53.360
Apparently there's information.

01:33:53.360 --> 01:33:54.360
A house.

01:33:56.360 --> 01:33:59.360
We're getting somewhere with you, Juliet.

01:33:59.360 --> 01:34:01.360
She's somewhere from here.

01:34:01.360 --> 01:34:03.360
The audio is a bit loud.

01:34:03.360 --> 01:34:06.360
Like in-game audio or me.

01:34:09.360 --> 01:34:12.360
I assume in-game audio got her address.

01:34:12.360 --> 01:34:13.360
We got her ass.

01:34:17.360 --> 01:34:19.360
I assume there's like nothing.

01:34:19.360 --> 01:34:22.360
These are all like in-game audio.

01:34:22.360 --> 01:34:24.360
I put it down by two decibels.

01:34:24.360 --> 01:34:25.360
I didn't know.

01:34:27.360 --> 01:34:29.360
I assume the red means there's something hidden on it

01:34:29.360 --> 01:34:31.360
that I'm supposed to be looking at.

01:34:35.360 --> 01:34:37.360
Is there more?

01:34:39.360 --> 01:34:41.360
Oh, there's a new picture of them.

01:34:42.360 --> 01:34:43.360
You're loud as fuck.

01:34:43.360 --> 01:34:44.360
Oh, shit.

01:34:44.360 --> 01:34:46.360
I'm actually...

01:34:48.360 --> 01:34:51.360
You guys just tolerating this the entire time?

01:34:55.360 --> 01:34:56.360
No, you're fine.

01:34:56.360 --> 01:34:57.360
Oh, okay.

01:34:58.360 --> 01:34:59.360
Comments.

01:34:59.360 --> 01:35:00.360
I love you.

01:35:00.360 --> 01:35:01.360
You're so amazing.

01:35:01.360 --> 01:35:03.360
My new favorite band.

01:35:03.360 --> 01:35:04.360
Greatest band of the nation.

01:35:04.360 --> 01:35:06.360
Except for the proclaimers.

01:35:06.360 --> 01:35:07.360
And stuff you did.

01:35:07.360 --> 01:35:08.360
That was really good.

01:35:09.360 --> 01:35:11.360
Please make yourself louder.

01:35:11.360 --> 01:35:12.360
Wait, are you trolling?

01:35:12.360 --> 01:35:13.360
You're trolling.

01:35:15.360 --> 01:35:16.360
Okay, so...

01:35:17.360 --> 01:35:19.360
We'll rinse the website.

01:35:19.360 --> 01:35:21.360
Okay, we've got a new one.

01:35:21.360 --> 01:35:23.360
Welcome to FBTN-

01:35:23.360 --> 01:35:25.360
Wait, we can just straight up go into his bank?

01:35:32.360 --> 01:35:34.360
I mean, he's got health insurance?

01:35:35.360 --> 01:35:36.360
And he's...

01:35:38.360 --> 01:35:41.360
A guy his age planning on doing something dangerous.

01:35:41.360 --> 01:35:43.360
And then he needs medicine.

01:35:43.360 --> 01:35:45.360
Comments are literally us for real.

01:35:46.360 --> 01:35:48.360
That comment...

01:35:51.360 --> 01:35:52.360
Whoa, what are you...

01:35:52.360 --> 01:35:53.360
Oh, you got...

01:35:54.360 --> 01:35:55.360
That...

01:35:55.360 --> 01:35:58.360
See, that's an incentive to...

01:35:59.360 --> 01:36:02.360
Do stuff against your actual personal beliefs.

01:36:03.360 --> 01:36:05.360
If you're getting that kind of money for doing an article.

01:36:05.360 --> 01:36:08.360
There's no way that's how much money you get for an article.

01:36:08.360 --> 01:36:10.360
Must be the payment for writing the column.

01:36:10.360 --> 01:36:12.360
Yeah, there's no way.

01:36:14.360 --> 01:36:16.360
Can we delete this?

01:36:16.360 --> 01:36:17.360
Oh my god, delete it please.

01:36:17.360 --> 01:36:20.360
Delete it before I get booted out of his bank, please.

01:36:22.360 --> 01:36:24.360
Delete it, delete it.

01:36:25.360 --> 01:36:26.360
Okay, the...

01:36:26.360 --> 01:36:29.360
Hancock's writing on the wall.

01:36:29.360 --> 01:36:31.360
Is this his blog?

01:36:32.360 --> 01:36:33.360
What is?

01:36:38.360 --> 01:36:39.360
What?

01:36:39.360 --> 01:36:40.360
After years,

01:36:41.360 --> 01:36:42.360
What?

01:36:42.360 --> 01:36:44.360
After years, my plan has taken shape.

01:36:44.360 --> 01:36:45.360
It even has name thought.

01:36:45.360 --> 01:36:50.360
Finally, counterpart to the radical regime of totalitarian surveillance.

01:36:50.360 --> 01:36:53.360
And I'm glad to have a capable companion in this.

01:36:53.360 --> 01:36:55.360
One who came up with the best idea for a demo, whatever.

01:36:55.360 --> 01:36:57.360
I'm not gonna tell you this as far as...

01:36:57.360 --> 01:36:59.360
I can only urge you to join us in our aim

01:36:59.360 --> 01:37:02.360
to unleash this pitiful, pathetic wannabe democracy

01:37:02.360 --> 01:37:04.360
of a country from its shackles.

01:37:04.360 --> 01:37:06.360
From freedom is not free in a place

01:37:06.360 --> 01:37:09.360
where every move is observed and analyzed.

01:37:09.360 --> 01:37:11.360
Wait, so he made it?

01:37:16.360 --> 01:37:17.360
Run around.

01:37:17.360 --> 01:37:19.360
I already got a nice plan on.

01:37:19.360 --> 01:37:22.360
As soon as I get myself a handful of like-minded people,

01:37:22.360 --> 01:37:25.360
we're gonna occupy the university.

01:37:25.360 --> 01:37:28.360
I bet we could scare those cardigan-wearing conformists

01:37:28.360 --> 01:37:30.360
a great deal by showing our ugly faces.

01:37:30.360 --> 01:37:32.360
Oh, how I'd love to see them running.

01:37:35.360 --> 01:37:37.360
I already live in a trailer.

01:37:40.360 --> 01:37:41.360
There we go.

01:37:42.360 --> 01:37:44.360
Can play city skylings one day.

01:37:44.360 --> 01:37:45.360
You can make a reefling city.

01:37:45.360 --> 01:37:46.360
Oh, can I?

01:37:46.360 --> 01:37:47.360
Oh, come on.

01:37:47.360 --> 01:37:50.360
Can you please get any more stereotypical antisocial?

01:37:50.360 --> 01:37:51.360
So what's the conflict?

01:37:51.360 --> 01:37:54.360
Plan to occupy the university.

01:38:03.360 --> 01:38:05.360
Planned a protest.

01:38:10.360 --> 01:38:14.360
So he's, he, as soon as I get myself like,

01:38:14.360 --> 01:38:16.360
we're gonna occupy.

01:38:18.360 --> 01:38:21.360
But she said she planned it.

01:38:24.360 --> 01:38:27.360
I think he's the mastermind behind it.

01:38:27.360 --> 01:38:29.360
So we'll do occupy instead of protest.

01:38:29.360 --> 01:38:32.360
It was an occupy he originally wanted to do.

01:38:32.360 --> 01:38:33.360
Very well.

01:38:33.360 --> 01:38:36.360
It is apparent, extreme, exactly as we suspected,

01:38:36.360 --> 01:38:39.360
but we still have no idea about the third location.

01:38:39.360 --> 01:38:40.360
You need to be diligent now.

01:38:40.360 --> 01:38:42.360
Lives may be hanging in the balance.

01:38:42.360 --> 01:38:43.360
In the worst case,

01:38:43.360 --> 01:38:45.360
that we cannot determine the location on time.

01:38:45.360 --> 01:38:47.360
Well, I might have to conduct an interrogation

01:38:47.360 --> 01:38:48.360
with Miss Watergate.

01:38:48.360 --> 01:38:50.360
I want to avoid it though, she's behaving

01:38:50.360 --> 01:38:52.360
pretty defiantly, I've been told.

01:38:52.360 --> 01:38:54.360
Looking at what you found so far,

01:38:54.360 --> 01:38:56.360
I think I might have enough information

01:38:56.360 --> 01:38:58.360
to put some pressure on her.

01:39:01.360 --> 01:39:03.360
No, no, no, I'm not done reading the book yet.

01:39:03.360 --> 01:39:04.360
Stop.

01:39:05.360 --> 01:39:06.360
Knock, knock.

01:39:06.360 --> 01:39:08.360
The thoughts are free once again.

01:39:08.360 --> 01:39:11.360
We are not done yet, you and me.

01:39:11.360 --> 01:39:14.360
But first, on, I must turn to another.

01:39:16.360 --> 01:39:18.360
I can't even find the word to him.

01:39:18.360 --> 01:39:21.360
Stupid, rejects government's proposition.

01:39:22.360 --> 01:39:25.360
And then the confliction is...

01:39:25.360 --> 01:39:28.360
No, so he doesn't actually support it.

01:39:28.360 --> 01:39:29.360
He got a fat paycheck,

01:39:29.360 --> 01:39:32.360
so whatever the other confliction is.

01:39:33.360 --> 01:39:34.360
Outskirts.

01:39:35.360 --> 01:39:36.360
Camping?

01:39:36.360 --> 01:39:38.360
He lives in a camping ground.

01:39:38.360 --> 01:39:40.360
Okay, we've got this location.

01:39:40.360 --> 01:39:42.360
Nothing wrong with cardigans,

01:39:42.360 --> 01:39:43.360
leave the cardigans alone.

01:39:43.360 --> 01:39:44.360
That's one ugly place,

01:39:44.360 --> 01:39:45.360
but I guess it's cheap.

01:39:45.360 --> 01:39:47.360
Okay, so I'm gonna wait.

01:39:48.360 --> 01:39:50.360
There are so many updates.

01:39:50.360 --> 01:39:53.360
Okay, user, fricking...

01:39:54.360 --> 01:39:55.360
What?

01:39:58.360 --> 01:39:59.360
Archived, archived.

01:39:59.360 --> 01:40:01.360
We can still archived.

01:40:01.360 --> 01:40:02.360
The website's back.

01:40:02.360 --> 01:40:04.360
Everything's archived.

01:40:08.360 --> 01:40:09.360
Mm-mm.

01:40:09.360 --> 01:40:10.360
Everything?

01:40:10.360 --> 01:40:11.360
Okay, would you need that?

01:40:11.360 --> 01:40:12.360
Entry 8.

01:40:13.360 --> 01:40:14.360
Just here?

01:40:14.360 --> 01:40:16.360
No, we've just got access to it again.

01:40:17.360 --> 01:40:19.360
Okay, we've just got access to it again.

01:40:19.360 --> 01:40:20.360
That's hot.

01:40:22.360 --> 01:40:23.360
Seems like...

01:40:24.360 --> 01:40:25.360
Ever family?

01:40:25.360 --> 01:40:27.360
There's something lurking on ever family.

01:40:27.360 --> 01:40:28.360
Whatever it is.

01:40:29.360 --> 01:40:31.360
What is it that's lurking?

01:40:33.360 --> 01:40:34.360
Okay, playing the guitar

01:40:34.360 --> 01:40:36.360
proves that she was definitely in the band.

01:40:36.360 --> 01:40:37.360
I'll allow it.

01:40:41.360 --> 01:40:43.360
Favorite color, red?

01:40:43.360 --> 01:40:45.360
Does this even have anything to do with anything?

01:40:45.360 --> 01:40:48.360
I feel like I'm just clogging up the system.

01:40:49.360 --> 01:40:52.360
Okay, I like jokes as much as the next person.

01:40:52.360 --> 01:40:55.360
But our favorite color, do you really think that is...?

01:40:55.360 --> 01:40:57.360
Okay, there is a bomb threat.

01:40:57.360 --> 01:40:58.360
Could you please focus on that?

01:40:58.360 --> 01:40:59.360
Okay, I'm sorry.

01:40:59.360 --> 01:41:00.360
I'm sorry.

01:41:00.360 --> 01:41:01.360
I'm sorry.

01:41:01.360 --> 01:41:03.360
I'm sorry.

01:41:03.360 --> 01:41:05.360
Okay, I got a little distracted.

01:41:05.360 --> 01:41:06.360
Okay, wall attacks.

01:41:06.360 --> 01:41:08.360
The important thing is here.

01:41:08.360 --> 01:41:09.360
Leave a message.

01:41:10.360 --> 01:41:11.360
The alien.

01:41:14.360 --> 01:41:17.360
I'm looking for people willing to join a thought.

01:41:17.360 --> 01:41:18.360
I can live it up.

01:41:19.360 --> 01:41:20.360
Oh.

01:41:21.360 --> 01:41:22.360
Wait.

01:41:27.360 --> 01:41:28.360
By pure coincidence,

01:41:28.360 --> 01:41:29.360
I stumbled on it.

01:41:29.360 --> 01:41:31.360
Frankly, you're thinking in your attitude

01:41:31.360 --> 01:41:32.360
to get people thinking

01:41:32.360 --> 01:41:34.360
is left an impression on me.

01:41:34.360 --> 01:41:37.360
So the professor

01:41:37.360 --> 01:41:39.360
messaged him.

01:41:40.360 --> 01:41:43.360
The professor didn't recruit them.

01:41:45.360 --> 01:41:46.360
Thank you for joining.

01:41:47.360 --> 01:41:49.360
I feel a little confused now.

01:41:50.360 --> 01:41:51.360
Is this thought a blog,

01:41:51.360 --> 01:41:52.360
an activist group,

01:41:52.360 --> 01:41:53.360
or a debate club,

01:41:53.360 --> 01:41:54.360
or all three?

01:41:54.360 --> 01:41:56.360
They're just really good at master debating.

01:41:56.360 --> 01:41:57.360
Okay.

01:42:00.360 --> 01:42:02.360
This is curious.

01:42:02.360 --> 01:42:03.360
I can't even find the words.

01:42:05.360 --> 01:42:06.360
Okay.

01:42:09.360 --> 01:42:12.360
We need to find that third debate club invitation.

01:42:17.360 --> 01:42:21.360
There is no way they put old memes in this.

01:42:21.360 --> 01:42:22.360
Are you joking?

01:42:23.360 --> 01:42:24.360
Favorite color, red.

01:42:24.360 --> 01:42:25.360
Red.

01:42:25.360 --> 01:42:26.360
Red wire.

01:42:26.360 --> 01:42:27.360
Bomba.

01:42:27.360 --> 01:42:28.360
Color red wire.

01:42:28.360 --> 01:42:29.360
Exactly.

01:42:29.360 --> 01:42:30.360
They put an old meme.

01:42:30.360 --> 01:42:32.360
Ain't nobody got time for that.

01:42:32.360 --> 01:42:33.360
Why is that donkey?

01:42:34.360 --> 01:42:36.360
Little donkey.

01:42:37.360 --> 01:42:39.360
Carry me.

01:42:40.360 --> 01:42:42.360
On the dust.

01:42:42.360 --> 01:42:45.360
So Nina, you will be very recruited.

01:42:45.360 --> 01:42:46.360
Nina.

01:42:47.360 --> 01:42:48.360
Nina.

01:42:50.360 --> 01:42:51.360
Nina, Nina, Nina.

01:42:52.360 --> 01:42:53.360
I don't know who Nina is.

01:42:55.360 --> 01:42:56.360
So there's another member

01:42:56.360 --> 01:42:57.360
we haven't even heard of.

01:42:57.360 --> 01:42:59.360
I would request clearance to make our target.

01:42:59.360 --> 01:43:00.360
We got the green light.

01:43:00.360 --> 01:43:02.360
They instantly give the green light.

01:43:02.360 --> 01:43:05.360
At concerned one, Nina.

01:43:06.360 --> 01:43:08.360
Oh, that was that comment on the blog.

01:43:11.360 --> 01:43:13.360
What a strange alias name.

01:43:15.360 --> 01:43:17.360
Ain't nobody got time for that.

01:43:18.360 --> 01:43:20.360
If someone's comment,

01:43:21.360 --> 01:43:22.360
no comment.

01:43:22.360 --> 01:43:23.360
No, there was a comment.

01:43:25.360 --> 01:43:26.360
There it is, concerned.

01:43:28.360 --> 01:43:31.360
No, we will carry into the streets of the nation,

01:43:31.360 --> 01:43:34.360
be transformed in the re-implanted back of their minds

01:43:34.360 --> 01:43:38.360
an invi-is-able idea that we shall always be free.

01:43:38.360 --> 01:43:41.360
Declare thought to be a revolutionary act of this group.

01:43:42.360 --> 01:43:44.360
Yes, I'm getting that vibe too.

01:43:45.360 --> 01:43:47.360
Donkey Girl for Gen 2.

01:43:47.360 --> 01:43:49.360
You guys are getting absolutely annihilated

01:43:49.360 --> 01:43:51.360
next week when we actually draw the concert.

01:43:52.360 --> 01:43:53.360
So an activist group after all

01:43:53.360 --> 01:43:55.360
and now we know who had the primary say in it.

01:43:59.360 --> 01:44:01.360
Any plans to restrict first?

01:44:03.360 --> 01:44:04.360
Oh!

01:44:05.360 --> 01:44:07.360
So what about holding a proclamation

01:44:07.360 --> 01:44:09.360
on a government building then?

01:44:10.360 --> 01:44:11.360
Sounds like a worthy first demo.

01:44:12.360 --> 01:44:13.360
A proclamation?

01:44:14.360 --> 01:44:16.360
We should go first storm in the malls.

01:44:20.360 --> 01:44:21.360
What?

01:44:23.360 --> 01:44:24.360
My friends,

01:44:24.360 --> 01:44:27.360
though I show your enthusiasm towards getting the people,

01:44:27.360 --> 01:44:28.360
it would be better to avoid

01:44:29.360 --> 01:44:31.360
as a place of demonstration.

01:44:31.360 --> 01:44:33.360
Ah, what pay, but you're probably right.

01:44:33.360 --> 01:44:37.360
So what about holding a proclamation on a government building?

01:44:39.360 --> 01:44:42.360
It was the Boston,

01:44:42.360 --> 01:44:44.360
although I know we want to gather more people to join,

01:44:44.360 --> 01:44:46.360
we should not discuss the matter.

01:44:46.360 --> 01:44:48.360
There are eyes that might be malicious.

01:44:50.360 --> 01:44:52.360
So it's a government building.

01:44:56.360 --> 01:44:58.360
He plans stuff, so it's him.

01:45:03.360 --> 01:45:04.360
The government, holy, that must be it.

01:45:04.360 --> 01:45:05.360
That's through the third bomba.

01:45:05.360 --> 01:45:07.360
But which one didn't say?

01:45:07.360 --> 01:45:08.360
That's it.

01:45:09.360 --> 01:45:10.360
Alright, if that's all we have,

01:45:10.360 --> 01:45:11.360
it's what we have to work with.

01:45:11.360 --> 01:45:13.360
So let's get the interrogation thing going

01:45:13.360 --> 01:45:14.360
before we run out of time.

01:45:15.360 --> 01:45:17.360
I'm actually located in the same facility

01:45:17.360 --> 01:45:19.360
where Miss Wargay has been detained.

01:45:19.360 --> 01:45:21.360
I will have her move to an interrogation room

01:45:21.360 --> 01:45:23.360
and walk across to cover my identity.

01:45:23.360 --> 01:45:26.360
I will connect to her via a wire.

01:45:26.360 --> 01:45:28.360
Let's just hope that you have provided,

01:45:30.360 --> 01:45:31.360
gives us enough leverage.

01:45:31.360 --> 01:45:34.360
I will open a connection for you to eavesdrop.

01:45:34.360 --> 01:45:36.360
After all, this is your case too.

01:45:36.360 --> 01:45:38.360
Plus we need all the possible info found.

01:45:39.360 --> 01:45:41.360
I'm not ready yet, hold on.

01:45:41.360 --> 01:45:43.360
You're like thrusting me into this.

01:45:44.360 --> 01:45:47.360
Hostile towards government?

01:45:51.360 --> 01:45:52.360
Rejects government.

01:45:54.360 --> 01:45:55.360
See, hostile?

01:45:56.360 --> 01:45:57.360
I think he rejects.

01:45:57.360 --> 01:45:59.360
I'm just going to put rejection.

01:45:59.360 --> 01:46:00.360
I have no idea.

01:46:01.360 --> 01:46:04.360
Anything else that would become a surprise?

01:46:04.360 --> 01:46:05.360
Oh my god.

01:46:05.360 --> 01:46:06.360
I'm not ready.

01:46:06.360 --> 01:46:07.360
Okay, what's going on?

01:46:07.360 --> 01:46:09.360
Right, we're listening to the interrogation.

01:46:09.360 --> 01:46:11.360
Stop saying stuff like this.

01:46:11.360 --> 01:46:12.360
Don't get hooked.

01:46:12.360 --> 01:46:13.360
Who is this?

01:46:13.360 --> 01:46:15.360
Why can't you just leave me alone?

01:46:15.360 --> 01:46:16.360
Miss Watergate?

01:46:16.360 --> 01:46:17.360
My name is Syme.

01:46:18.360 --> 01:46:19.360
Great, Symes, can you go-

01:46:20.360 --> 01:46:22.360
I already told the other guys everything over and over again.

01:46:22.360 --> 01:46:24.360
It wasn't me who hurt the officer.

01:46:25.360 --> 01:46:27.360
We have new evidence that states otherwise,

01:46:27.360 --> 01:46:29.360
which is why you are in custody.

01:46:30.360 --> 01:46:32.360
But that's not what this is about.

01:46:32.360 --> 01:46:35.360
We are investigating the bomber at Freedom Plaza.

01:46:36.360 --> 01:46:38.360
I just want to ask you some questions.

01:46:38.360 --> 01:46:39.360
Cooperate?

01:46:39.360 --> 01:46:41.360
Oh god, I cannot read that fast.

01:46:41.360 --> 01:46:42.360
Are you joking?

01:46:42.360 --> 01:46:43.360
You might reflect positive.

01:46:43.360 --> 01:46:45.360
Oh, and you want to frame me?

01:46:45.360 --> 01:46:47.360
I've been so busy.

01:46:47.360 --> 01:46:51.360
I was right here imprisoned while I did the bomber.

01:46:51.360 --> 01:46:53.360
We know you didn't trigger the bomber,

01:46:53.360 --> 01:46:56.360
maybe not even the one at Freedom Plaza.

01:46:56.360 --> 01:46:57.360
But we do know, however,

01:46:57.360 --> 01:46:59.360
you have been in close contact with a group called Thought.

01:46:59.360 --> 01:47:00.360
What?

01:47:00.360 --> 01:47:01.360
They have nothing to do with this.

01:47:01.360 --> 01:47:03.360
I want to talk to my lawyer right now.

01:47:03.360 --> 01:47:05.360
You mean that boyfriend of yours?

01:47:05.360 --> 01:47:07.360
Joseph Langlin.

01:47:07.360 --> 01:47:08.360
My boyfriend?

01:47:08.360 --> 01:47:09.360
How do you know that?

01:47:09.360 --> 01:47:12.360
We know a lot about you, Miss Watergate.

01:47:12.360 --> 01:47:14.360
I don't need to call him then.

01:47:14.360 --> 01:47:15.360
No shovel.

01:47:15.360 --> 01:47:18.360
Your defiance towards me is not advisable.

01:47:18.360 --> 01:47:20.360
What about your parents?

01:47:20.360 --> 01:47:21.360
Bruno and Alice?

01:47:21.360 --> 01:47:23.360
They've got a nice company, don't they?

01:47:23.360 --> 01:47:25.360
Association with a criminal case against their daughter.

01:47:25.360 --> 01:47:27.360
Yeah, again, could hurt them badly.

01:47:27.360 --> 01:47:29.360
Last time I was in custody,

01:47:29.360 --> 01:47:33.360
all they ever did about it was suggesting I'd leave my position.

01:47:34.360 --> 01:47:37.360
Does that give you the impression of a perfect family?

01:47:37.360 --> 01:47:39.360
Well, have it your way then.

01:47:39.360 --> 01:47:44.360
We have your confession in regards to that nasty incident with the police officer.

01:47:44.360 --> 01:47:46.360
You'll have to go through the whole process again.

01:47:46.360 --> 01:47:49.360
It's gonna drag on for a long time.

01:47:49.360 --> 01:47:51.360
And where did you get this supposed confession?

01:47:51.360 --> 01:47:53.360
I never did anything.

01:47:53.360 --> 01:47:56.360
Miss Carrington stated this in a conversation with you.

01:47:56.360 --> 01:48:00.360
Have you been spying on us, you dirty little government?

01:48:00.360 --> 01:48:04.360
Well, I hope you also noticed that she started this in defence.

01:48:04.360 --> 01:48:06.360
Indeed, we did know that.

01:48:06.360 --> 01:48:07.360
That doesn't.

01:48:07.360 --> 01:48:09.360
That does mean you have nothing on me.

01:48:09.360 --> 01:48:11.360
It seems my colleagues didn't tell you.

01:48:11.360 --> 01:48:15.360
You have been arrested as potentially dangerous, did they?

01:48:15.360 --> 01:48:16.360
Potentially dangerous.

01:48:16.360 --> 01:48:18.360
I like the sound of that.

01:48:18.360 --> 01:48:19.360
Me?

01:48:19.360 --> 01:48:21.360
Me so dangerous.

01:48:21.360 --> 01:48:23.360
This is not a joke, Miss Watergate.

01:48:23.360 --> 01:48:25.360
See, it's all in this profile here,

01:48:25.360 --> 01:48:28.360
in accordance with the safety bill people have assessed,

01:48:28.360 --> 01:48:31.360
as potentially dangerous may be held in custody for a very long time

01:48:31.360 --> 01:48:33.360
until they are deemed no longer a threat.

01:48:33.360 --> 01:48:36.360
BS, you can't just make something and flag me as dangerous

01:48:36.360 --> 01:48:38.360
just because it suits your case.

01:48:38.360 --> 01:48:40.360
It's an official investigation result

01:48:40.360 --> 01:48:42.360
and we can double that time span.

01:48:42.360 --> 01:48:44.360
You'll sit in here with the police record linkers.

01:48:44.360 --> 01:48:46.360
No, why?

01:48:46.360 --> 01:48:49.360
I hope you will link yourself and your cellmates,

01:48:49.360 --> 01:48:53.360
but cooperate and avoid this at once.

01:48:53.360 --> 01:48:55.360
Why are you doing this to me?

01:48:55.360 --> 01:48:57.360
Just answer my questions

01:48:57.360 --> 01:48:59.360
and I might be able to help.

01:48:59.360 --> 01:49:01.360
I don't know what you expect from me.

01:49:01.360 --> 01:49:03.360
I first went to the Plaza demo.

01:49:03.360 --> 01:49:05.360
I don't know much about their plans.

01:49:05.360 --> 01:49:07.360
We know that Mr. O'Donnell

01:49:07.360 --> 01:49:10.360
had plans to have a kind of proclamation

01:49:10.360 --> 01:49:12.360
on the roof of a government building.

01:49:12.360 --> 01:49:13.360
Do you know which one?

01:49:13.360 --> 01:49:15.360
Government building?

01:49:15.360 --> 01:49:17.360
I never heard of anything like that.

01:49:17.360 --> 01:49:19.360
I think Miss Watergate,

01:49:19.360 --> 01:49:21.360
they have had mentioned anything remotely like that.

01:49:21.360 --> 01:49:22.360
Damn it.

01:49:22.360 --> 01:49:23.360
I don't know.

01:49:23.360 --> 01:49:24.360
There is nothing.

01:49:24.360 --> 01:49:26.360
There has got to be something.

01:49:26.360 --> 01:49:27.360
Talk!

01:49:27.360 --> 01:49:30.360
No, there is never...

01:49:30.360 --> 01:49:32.360
I swear, I don't...

01:49:32.360 --> 01:49:35.360
This is it, Miss Watergate.

01:49:35.360 --> 01:49:37.360
This interrogation is over.

01:49:39.360 --> 01:49:41.360
I did not go planned at all, not at all.

01:49:41.360 --> 01:49:44.360
I wonder if we went wrong about this place.

01:49:44.360 --> 01:49:45.360
Oops.

01:49:45.360 --> 01:49:46.360
So what do we do now?

01:49:46.360 --> 01:49:48.360
We run out of time and options.

01:49:48.360 --> 01:49:51.360
Evacuate just by making an educated guess

01:49:51.360 --> 01:49:54.360
that would cause a PR disaster.

01:49:54.360 --> 01:49:57.360
We need ideas and fast, else...

01:49:59.360 --> 01:50:00.360
I'm sure we're too late.

01:50:00.360 --> 01:50:02.360
No, no, no, no, no, no!

01:50:02.360 --> 01:50:04.360
We could have prevented this.

01:50:04.360 --> 01:50:05.360
Was it the mall?

01:50:05.360 --> 01:50:06.360
If only...

01:50:06.360 --> 01:50:07.360
I don't know, shit.

01:50:07.360 --> 01:50:09.360
There's got to be some serious fallout.

01:50:09.360 --> 01:50:11.360
I'll do what I can to keep us in a job.

01:50:11.360 --> 01:50:13.360
I think I need fired if it was at the mall.

01:50:13.360 --> 01:50:15.360
We need to pull this group apart.

01:50:15.360 --> 01:50:18.360
Tomorrow we'll have a serious Nina.

01:50:18.360 --> 01:50:19.360
Until then, you're dismissed.

01:50:19.360 --> 01:50:20.360
Wait.

01:50:20.360 --> 01:50:21.360
Was it at the...

01:50:21.360 --> 01:50:23.360
Oops, sorry, wrong one.

01:50:25.360 --> 01:50:27.360
It was the mall!

01:50:27.360 --> 01:50:30.360
Wait, how is that supposed to pick either or?

01:50:30.360 --> 01:50:33.360
Was that supposed to know that he wasn't organizing stuff?

01:50:35.360 --> 01:50:36.360
It was the mall.

01:50:36.360 --> 01:50:38.360
So it was Nina.

01:50:43.360 --> 01:50:45.360
No way I got rolled.

01:50:46.360 --> 01:50:49.360
So the conflicting information?

01:50:56.360 --> 01:50:58.360
She didn't know Nina doesn't...

01:51:00.360 --> 01:51:02.360
Oh, she messed up the organized.

01:51:02.360 --> 01:51:03.360
Interesting.

01:51:03.360 --> 01:51:04.360
What did she do?

01:51:06.360 --> 01:51:07.360
It wasn't Nina.

01:51:07.360 --> 01:51:09.360
Rip hot topic, honestly.

01:51:09.360 --> 01:51:10.360
You will be missed.

01:51:11.360 --> 01:51:13.360
Oh, that's so frustrating.

01:51:13.360 --> 01:51:15.360
Okay, I understand.

01:51:17.360 --> 01:51:19.360
Anyone knows this game has multiple endings?

01:51:19.360 --> 01:51:20.360
It definitely has multiple endings

01:51:20.360 --> 01:51:23.360
because I never unlocked the correct ending.

01:51:27.360 --> 01:51:29.360
Everything looks fine.

01:51:31.360 --> 01:51:32.360
Are you sure?

01:51:32.360 --> 01:51:33.360
Yeah, sure.

01:51:33.360 --> 01:51:34.360
Whatever I've missed, I've missed.

01:51:34.360 --> 01:51:35.360
I got an achievement.

01:51:35.360 --> 01:51:37.360
Complete episode 2.

01:51:37.360 --> 01:51:38.360
He was...

01:51:38.360 --> 01:51:40.360
Okay, so...

01:51:41.360 --> 01:51:44.360
We picked up a lot of information.

01:51:47.360 --> 01:51:49.360
So we need Nina.

01:51:50.360 --> 01:51:52.360
Harrison's been cleared.

01:51:52.360 --> 01:51:54.360
Juliet wasn't even a suspect.

01:51:54.360 --> 01:51:55.360
Again, Abraham says,

01:51:55.360 --> 01:51:56.360
Oh, Nina?

01:52:00.360 --> 01:52:01.360
Unperson.

01:52:06.360 --> 01:52:08.360
Here we are again after having steered into the bus

01:52:08.360 --> 01:52:10.360
not unscathed but alive and still with a job.

01:52:10.360 --> 01:52:12.360
I was able to keep us in the business.

01:52:12.360 --> 01:52:14.360
My superiors don't want to give up on Orwell just yet.

01:52:14.360 --> 01:52:16.360
Needless to say, we cannot

01:52:16.360 --> 01:52:18.360
afford to repeat a failure like yesterday.

01:52:18.360 --> 01:52:22.360
The TMB is already starting to tear us apart, Lisa!

01:52:22.360 --> 01:52:25.360
This Nina character is a final member of thought

01:52:25.360 --> 01:52:27.360
and we don't have concrete info.

01:52:27.360 --> 01:52:29.360
Since Harrison's plan with the government building

01:52:29.360 --> 01:52:30.360
turned out to be a dead end,

01:52:30.360 --> 01:52:32.360
we need to get a clearer picture of the loose.

01:52:32.360 --> 01:52:34.360
Her stance towards law enforcement

01:52:34.360 --> 01:52:36.360
just gives us one more reason

01:52:36.360 --> 01:52:38.360
as you found out yesterday.

01:52:38.360 --> 01:52:41.360
Focus on Nina, but keep watching all the others too.

01:52:41.360 --> 01:52:44.360
Sorry, I kind of thought you wanted to go to my bedtime.

01:52:47.360 --> 01:52:48.360
My part.

01:52:49.360 --> 01:52:51.360
Hey, forgot to charge my phone last night.

01:52:51.360 --> 01:52:53.360
So yeah, I have to do it the old fashioned way.

01:52:53.360 --> 01:52:55.360
I really want to thank you for a nice evening.

01:52:57.360 --> 01:52:59.360
Only to be topped by that night.

01:52:59.360 --> 01:53:00.360
That's it.

01:53:00.360 --> 01:53:02.360
I was hoping you'd drop your...

01:53:02.360 --> 01:53:04.360
by CCC to come pick me up.

01:53:05.360 --> 01:53:07.360
The girl was yammering about...

01:53:08.360 --> 01:53:10.360
opposes the safety bill.

01:53:13.360 --> 01:53:14.360
Hi, Mark.

01:53:14.360 --> 01:53:16.360
Is she be about to come online?

01:53:19.360 --> 01:53:21.360
Why would anyone oppose the safety bill?

01:53:21.360 --> 01:53:23.360
We have the lowest crime rate in years or possibly ever.

01:53:23.360 --> 01:53:26.360
You and me, we have the job thanks to the bill.

01:53:26.360 --> 01:53:30.360
The only reason to not support is if you have a dirty, dirty past.

01:53:30.360 --> 01:53:32.360
But the situation is here as it is.

01:53:32.360 --> 01:53:35.360
It's like someone we should have a very close look at.

01:53:35.360 --> 01:53:38.360
We need to fill examination.

01:53:38.360 --> 01:53:40.360
First, a concrete background on who.

01:53:40.360 --> 01:53:42.360
Second, what motivators.

01:53:42.360 --> 01:53:47.360
And finally, where was she around the time of the bomba?

01:53:47.360 --> 01:53:48.360
Let's find out.

01:53:48.360 --> 01:53:50.360
Where are the headlines?

01:53:50.360 --> 01:53:52.360
Catastrophe strikes.

01:53:52.360 --> 01:53:53.360
One passed away.

01:53:55.360 --> 01:53:57.360
Then for doing a donut time.

01:53:57.360 --> 01:53:59.360
Mummy...

01:54:01.360 --> 01:54:02.360
Enough of the dirty past.

01:54:02.360 --> 01:54:04.360
Let's talk about my dirty future.

01:54:08.360 --> 01:54:12.360
Maybe really endangered by lawsuit against the rector.

01:54:12.360 --> 01:54:13.360
The surrounding.

01:54:14.360 --> 01:54:16.360
The national opinion.

01:54:16.360 --> 01:54:17.360
And last week, no.

01:54:18.360 --> 01:54:21.360
Predicted assaults only to sell his point to the column.

01:54:21.360 --> 01:54:23.360
Condemns the bomba.

01:54:23.360 --> 01:54:25.360
Predicts the bomba.

01:54:27.360 --> 01:54:31.360
Wait, so what is his stance of that?

01:54:33.360 --> 01:54:35.360
A strange way to sell one's point.

01:54:35.360 --> 01:54:39.360
It's still peculiarly mentioned bomba before anything happened, but well.

01:54:39.360 --> 01:54:41.360
Are you squiddin' me right now?

01:54:41.360 --> 01:54:42.360
Ah!

01:54:42.360 --> 01:54:45.360
So are we creating the scenario from the marrow?

01:54:45.360 --> 01:54:47.360
No! Broly legend.

01:54:47.360 --> 01:54:48.360
Thank you for the tip.

01:54:48.360 --> 01:54:51.360
If it's the marrow or my bad, no.

01:54:51.360 --> 01:54:55.360
Prosecure calls on people to take care of their own safety.

01:54:55.360 --> 01:54:58.360
Wait, is he completely not going punk anymore?

01:54:58.360 --> 01:55:00.360
And he's back to Wolf?

01:55:01.360 --> 01:55:04.360
I'm getting confused now.

01:55:06.360 --> 01:55:10.360
We cannot save everyone, but we're still a watchful eye on the nation.

01:55:10.360 --> 01:55:12.360
Is he completely...

01:55:12.360 --> 01:55:14.360
Hey kiddo, you're absolutely right.

01:55:14.360 --> 01:55:16.360
One could call that even a mind blown.

01:55:16.360 --> 01:55:18.360
But let's not stay at my place tonight.

01:55:19.360 --> 01:55:20.360
Okay.

01:55:20.360 --> 01:55:22.360
It's unfit for a lady.

01:55:22.360 --> 01:55:24.360
No lovers hidden there.

01:55:24.360 --> 01:55:26.360
I'm done with her because of...

01:55:27.360 --> 01:55:28.360
Okay.

01:55:30.360 --> 01:55:31.360
Okay, okay, okay.

01:55:31.360 --> 01:55:33.360
New girlfriend got it.

01:55:34.360 --> 01:55:35.360
Thank you sir.

01:55:35.360 --> 01:55:36.360
Anina, you mean anything?

01:55:36.360 --> 01:55:38.360
Oh, Juliet and Harrison, where'd you go?

01:55:38.360 --> 01:55:39.360
That's...

01:55:39.360 --> 01:55:40.360
That one's news to me.

01:55:40.360 --> 01:55:41.360
Guess it didn't matter.

01:55:41.360 --> 01:55:42.360
Now that's over.

01:55:42.360 --> 01:55:43.360
Oh, I thought it wasn't.

01:55:43.360 --> 01:55:45.360
Anything will set me off.

01:55:45.360 --> 01:55:46.360
Angry at birth.

01:55:46.360 --> 01:55:47.360
Get angry at birth.

01:55:47.360 --> 01:55:48.360
Angry at birth.

01:55:48.360 --> 01:55:51.360
She was my partner in crime a while ago.

01:55:54.360 --> 01:55:56.360
I think that's just a saying.

01:55:57.360 --> 01:56:01.360
Oh no, it's the only thing I can pick information from, I think.

01:56:02.360 --> 01:56:04.360
Making Gen 2 is supposed to be a private affair.

01:56:04.360 --> 01:56:05.360
Exactly.

01:56:06.360 --> 01:56:08.360
We'll be making it very soon together.

01:56:09.360 --> 01:56:10.360
Since then.

01:56:11.360 --> 01:56:12.360
Anything?

01:56:13.360 --> 01:56:15.360
The edited movie poster.

01:56:15.360 --> 01:56:16.360
Oh, go on then.

01:56:16.360 --> 01:56:18.360
A hundred gray shadows.

01:56:18.360 --> 01:56:21.360
I thought that was going to be a 50 shades of gray.

01:56:21.360 --> 01:56:23.360
50 shades of gray.

01:56:23.360 --> 01:56:25.360
A hundred gray shadows.

01:56:25.360 --> 01:56:26.360
Okay.

01:56:27.360 --> 01:56:29.360
Quit fooling around.

01:56:29.360 --> 01:56:31.360
War on indifference.

01:56:31.360 --> 01:56:33.360
Oh, this is done by Nina.

01:56:37.360 --> 01:56:39.360
Okay, Nina, you're going down.

01:56:39.360 --> 01:56:40.360
You wait for it.

01:56:41.360 --> 01:56:42.360
Just confess, get him.

01:56:46.360 --> 01:56:48.360
Right, let me just check.

01:56:48.360 --> 01:56:50.360
So, war on indifference.

01:56:50.360 --> 01:56:55.360
Indifference towards our own rights is the worst enemy than the government itself.

01:56:56.360 --> 01:56:57.360
What?

01:56:57.360 --> 01:56:59.360
Okay, so how...

01:57:00.360 --> 01:57:03.360
How you in particular incited the crowd to directly threaten the visitors.

01:57:03.360 --> 01:57:05.360
Intended to scare them.

01:57:06.360 --> 01:57:09.360
You intended to scare them and nuke them?

01:57:10.360 --> 01:57:13.360
That was a bit of a miscalculation, was it not?

01:57:13.360 --> 01:57:17.360
Scaring people to get attention to one's message, really, is this what thought is about?

01:57:17.360 --> 01:57:21.360
You know what I agree with being oblivious in the matter is the problem...

01:57:21.360 --> 01:57:23.360
Roots, problem, problem, roots.

01:57:23.360 --> 01:57:25.360
We've discussed this many times.

01:57:25.360 --> 01:57:27.360
What the heck?

01:57:28.360 --> 01:57:30.360
Violence cannot be the key.

01:57:30.360 --> 01:57:32.360
Condemned violence, okay.

01:57:32.360 --> 01:57:35.360
So Abraham's old school, but Nina...

01:57:36.360 --> 01:57:38.360
That was really...

01:57:39.360 --> 01:57:43.360
We got a little bit carried away in the info, we're finally getting our message out there.

01:57:43.360 --> 01:57:46.360
Now this is recent, Hancock is confusing the crap out of me.

01:57:46.360 --> 01:57:48.360
I think he's just getting a paycheck.

01:57:50.360 --> 01:57:53.360
She didn't plan to stream today as far as I see, no navigation, okay.

01:57:53.360 --> 01:57:55.360
Is Emmy coming on?

01:57:55.360 --> 01:58:00.360
Afterwards they're clever and feel sorry about their actions, it's always the same.

01:58:00.360 --> 01:58:03.360
I mean, people are allowed to feel remorse.

01:58:03.360 --> 01:58:04.360
Stereo.

01:58:04.360 --> 01:58:06.360
Unknown person and Nina.

01:58:07.360 --> 01:58:08.360
He's still...

01:58:08.360 --> 01:58:10.360
Oh, stop giving me new people.

01:58:10.360 --> 01:58:12.360
I can't remember everyone.

01:58:13.360 --> 01:58:15.360
Just wanted to ask if everyone's fine.

01:58:17.360 --> 01:58:19.360
Yeah, don't worry, we're having a great time.

01:58:19.360 --> 01:58:20.360
Okay.

01:58:20.360 --> 01:58:22.360
Emmy, it comes on in two hours.

01:58:22.360 --> 01:58:23.360
Okay, okay, okay.

01:58:23.360 --> 01:58:26.360
Thank you for taking care, even though it's Saturday.

01:58:26.360 --> 01:58:27.360
Don't mention it, Smile.

01:58:27.360 --> 01:58:29.360
How are you feeling?

01:58:29.360 --> 01:58:32.360
I think we're gonna have to play the last two chapters tomorrow.

01:58:32.360 --> 01:58:35.360
My brain is absolutely killing it.

01:58:35.360 --> 01:58:38.360
Nina, I hate to say it, but don't hold it against me, okay?

01:58:38.360 --> 01:58:40.360
I'm fine.

01:58:40.360 --> 01:58:42.360
Why are you fine?

01:58:43.360 --> 01:58:44.360
No, you're not.

01:58:44.360 --> 01:58:46.360
You always look so sad.

01:58:46.360 --> 01:58:48.360
Often sad now.

01:58:48.360 --> 01:58:50.360
That's not anything to do with anything.

01:58:50.360 --> 01:58:53.360
No, don't worry about anything new on the love front, no.

01:58:54.360 --> 01:58:56.360
God, you're really hard to talk to.

01:58:56.360 --> 01:58:57.360
These one...

01:58:57.360 --> 01:59:00.360
These like two cents replies are awful.

01:59:00.360 --> 01:59:03.360
Only idiots on the singular portal thing you recommended.

01:59:03.360 --> 01:59:06.360
Ooh, we might have a connection.

01:59:06.360 --> 01:59:08.360
Related document.

01:59:08.360 --> 01:59:10.360
Understand we didn't get any risks.

01:59:10.360 --> 01:59:11.360
Where?

01:59:11.360 --> 01:59:15.360
My dad's so understanding about it, like he took me to a cafe

01:59:15.360 --> 01:59:19.360
and I stupidly ordered the fry up thinking it was gonna be like a British fry up.

01:59:19.360 --> 01:59:23.360
It was not obviously a British fry up, so I was raging eating it.

01:59:23.360 --> 01:59:29.360
Because I was like, why the fuck did I honestly think this was gonna be a real fry up?

01:59:29.360 --> 01:59:32.360
Felt like an absolute twat, like of course.

01:59:32.360 --> 01:59:33.360
Of course it's not.

01:59:33.360 --> 01:59:34.360
Right, singular.

01:59:34.360 --> 01:59:36.360
Ooh, don't be single.

01:59:36.360 --> 01:59:38.360
Be singular.

01:59:40.360 --> 01:59:42.360
Continue to your profile.

01:59:44.360 --> 01:59:46.360
This is her.

01:59:46.360 --> 01:59:47.360
Oh, you're done for.

01:59:47.360 --> 01:59:48.360
We got you.

01:59:48.360 --> 01:59:49.360
Oh, we got your height as well.

01:59:49.360 --> 01:59:51.360
Oh, it's over for you.

01:59:52.360 --> 01:59:53.360
Oh, we know your location.

01:59:53.360 --> 01:59:54.360
Oh, it's over.

01:59:55.360 --> 01:59:56.360
All is to find a man.

01:59:56.360 --> 01:59:58.360
October 1985.

01:59:58.360 --> 01:59:59.360
Looking for him.

01:59:59.360 --> 02:00:01.360
She's a man.

02:00:01.360 --> 02:00:02.360
She's heterosexual.

02:00:03.360 --> 02:00:04.360
Oh, sure.

02:00:04.360 --> 02:00:06.360
We'll do height for profile description.

02:00:08.360 --> 02:00:09.360
Okay.

02:00:09.360 --> 02:00:10.360
Hiking, climbing, agent for the wheel.

02:00:10.360 --> 02:00:11.360
Suits.

02:00:11.360 --> 02:00:12.360
She's doing the bullet.

02:00:12.360 --> 02:00:14.360
Late dinner, Stephen Baldwin.

02:00:14.360 --> 02:00:16.360
Well, we've got a picture.

02:00:16.360 --> 02:00:17.360
Go to Jim.

02:00:17.360 --> 02:00:19.360
Jim knows how to train.

02:00:19.360 --> 02:00:21.360
What a weirdo.

02:00:22.360 --> 02:00:23.360
She's looking.

02:00:23.360 --> 02:00:26.360
Your, your opinions.

02:00:26.360 --> 02:00:27.360
Ooh.

02:00:27.360 --> 02:00:30.360
Financial stability.

02:00:31.360 --> 02:00:35.360
How long do you wish for your next relationship to last?

02:00:36.360 --> 02:00:41.360
Don't these websites not date to, like, have,

02:00:41.360 --> 02:00:43.360
like, a forever relationship?

02:00:43.360 --> 02:00:44.360
Am I going crazy?

02:00:44.360 --> 02:00:47.360
Would you consider allowing your partner to see other people?

02:00:48.360 --> 02:00:50.360
She's sowing in.

02:00:52.360 --> 02:00:56.360
Would you consider dating someone who does not want our disliked children?

02:00:56.360 --> 02:00:57.360
No.

02:00:57.360 --> 02:00:58.360
Oh, she want to birth them babies.

02:00:58.360 --> 02:00:59.360
Okay.

02:00:59.360 --> 02:01:01.360
What place would you like to go on vacation?

02:01:01.360 --> 02:01:02.360
Cities.

02:01:02.360 --> 02:01:03.360
Seaside.

02:01:03.360 --> 02:01:04.360
Man, countryside.

02:01:04.360 --> 02:01:05.360
Cities.

02:01:05.360 --> 02:01:07.360
There's so much to do in the cities.

02:01:07.360 --> 02:01:09.360
Oh, she polyamorous.

02:01:09.360 --> 02:01:11.360
How interested in polytricks are you?

02:01:11.360 --> 02:01:12.360
Quite a bit.

02:01:12.360 --> 02:01:13.360
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

02:01:13.360 --> 02:01:15.360
Are you a cat or dog person?

02:01:17.360 --> 02:01:18.360
Oh, yeah.

02:01:18.360 --> 02:01:19.360
Oh, I guess cat.

02:01:19.360 --> 02:01:24.360
If you turn a, if you turn a left-handed glove inside out, it fits.

02:01:25.360 --> 02:01:28.360
Wait, is this a logic question?

02:01:28.360 --> 02:01:29.360
Stop, hold on.

02:01:29.360 --> 02:01:34.360
If you turn a left-handed glove inside out, it fits the left hand.

02:01:36.360 --> 02:01:38.360
Is it still a left-handed glove?

02:01:39.360 --> 02:01:41.360
I like the countryside as well.

02:01:41.360 --> 02:01:42.360
What are the other questions?

02:01:44.360 --> 02:01:46.360
What are you looking for in a partner?

02:01:46.360 --> 02:01:49.360
True love, honesty, fidelity?

02:01:49.360 --> 02:01:50.360
What's fidelity?

02:01:50.360 --> 02:01:53.360
Isn't infidelity what people get killed for?

02:01:54.360 --> 02:01:55.360
I'm going crazy.

02:01:55.360 --> 02:02:01.360
Social connection, communication, humor, financial, acceptance, openness, independence, casual fun.

02:02:01.360 --> 02:02:05.360
Acceptance and true love.

02:02:06.360 --> 02:02:07.360
Me and the Wraithling.

02:02:11.360 --> 02:02:12.360
Oh, faith.

02:02:12.360 --> 02:02:14.360
Oh, well, we ain't checking that box.

02:02:14.360 --> 02:02:15.360
Sorry.

02:02:16.360 --> 02:02:19.360
I am your, you can have faith in me.

02:02:19.360 --> 02:02:20.360
What's this?

02:02:20.360 --> 02:02:21.360
Conversate.

02:02:21.360 --> 02:02:22.360
To start a new conversation.

02:02:22.360 --> 02:02:23.360
Hey, I just saw your profile.

02:02:24.360 --> 02:02:26.360
Super Randy.

02:02:29.360 --> 02:02:31.360
Why Sam, but not Samwise.

02:02:31.360 --> 02:02:33.360
Hi, concerns.

02:02:33.360 --> 02:02:34.360
Oh my God.

02:02:34.360 --> 02:02:36.360
By the way, it's Molly.

02:02:36.360 --> 02:02:37.360
Oh, we've got a name.

02:02:39.360 --> 02:02:40.360
We've got a name.

02:02:40.360 --> 02:02:41.360
Thank you, Samwise Gamgee.

02:02:41.360 --> 02:02:43.360
You helped us progress the floor.

02:02:44.360 --> 02:02:46.360
She's using such a peculiar one of that.

02:02:48.360 --> 02:02:49.360
Why?

02:02:54.360 --> 02:02:55.360
It's my son?

02:02:55.360 --> 02:02:56.360
She has a wane?

02:03:00.360 --> 02:03:01.360
Or is this fake?

02:03:01.360 --> 02:03:02.360
Wait, is this conversation fake?

02:03:02.360 --> 02:03:03.360
Hi.

02:03:03.360 --> 02:03:04.360
Hi, Sam.

02:03:04.360 --> 02:03:05.360
It's Kevin Freshman.

02:03:05.360 --> 02:03:06.360
We're going to date.

02:03:06.360 --> 02:03:08.360
Just send me to a local Chinese.

02:03:08.360 --> 02:03:09.360
I don't care.

02:03:09.360 --> 02:03:10.360
By the way, my name is Molly.

02:03:10.360 --> 02:03:11.360
You got my Molly.

02:03:11.360 --> 02:03:12.360
Oh, maybe she does have a wane.

02:03:12.360 --> 02:03:13.360
All right, you got a wane.

02:03:17.360 --> 02:03:18.360
A single mother, huh?

02:03:18.360 --> 02:03:22.360
Doesn't seem like the type to be involved with such things, right?

02:03:22.360 --> 02:03:25.360
What about your conversation with Superman?

02:03:25.360 --> 02:03:26.360
Blondie, seriously?

02:03:26.360 --> 02:03:28.360
Everyone call me Blondie.

02:03:28.360 --> 02:03:29.360
Great, me too.

02:03:29.360 --> 02:03:30.360
So where are we going now?

02:03:30.360 --> 02:03:31.360
We're not.

02:03:31.360 --> 02:03:32.360
Now I totally get why you're there.

02:03:32.360 --> 02:03:33.360
You're still single.

02:03:33.360 --> 02:03:34.360
I can't believe it.

02:03:34.360 --> 02:03:35.360
That's hilarious.

02:03:37.360 --> 02:03:40.360
So, I didn't even reply to him.

02:03:41.360 --> 02:03:43.360
Well, she didn't reply to him.

02:03:44.360 --> 02:03:45.360
What else?

02:03:45.360 --> 02:03:46.360
I don't know.

02:03:49.360 --> 02:03:50.360
I don't know.

02:03:50.360 --> 02:03:52.360
It's a phlegic for her description.

02:03:53.360 --> 02:03:54.360
I'll take it.

02:03:54.360 --> 02:03:55.360
Does she go to gym?

02:03:55.360 --> 02:03:57.360
Maybe she go to gym.

02:03:58.360 --> 02:04:03.360
For daily's faithfulness and religious practice or loyal in a relationship.

02:04:06.360 --> 02:04:07.360
Oh, Amy published the new ASMR.

02:04:07.360 --> 02:04:08.360
I see bloggers.

02:04:09.360 --> 02:04:10.360
She's catfishing.

02:04:11.360 --> 02:04:12.360
I don't know.

02:04:12.360 --> 02:04:14.360
There's something on that page I'm missing.

02:04:16.360 --> 02:04:22.360
Okay, I've definitely missed something about your conversations or something else here.

02:04:23.360 --> 02:04:24.360
Okay, sure.

02:04:24.360 --> 02:04:25.360
Temporary.

02:04:25.360 --> 02:04:26.360
Why not?

02:04:27.360 --> 02:04:28.360
Oh, God.

02:04:28.360 --> 02:04:29.360
May I relay a document?

02:04:29.360 --> 02:04:35.360
See, something you think is not logged in on her account.

02:04:36.360 --> 02:04:37.360
New profile picture.

02:04:37.360 --> 02:04:38.360
Go for it.

02:04:40.360 --> 02:04:41.360
See, recent jobs.

02:04:41.360 --> 02:04:43.360
What are you being doing?

02:04:44.360 --> 02:04:48.360
Has worked in multiple jobs during the week.

02:04:49.360 --> 02:04:52.360
But we've not found the conflicting data yet.

02:04:54.360 --> 02:04:55.360
We'll work a lot.

02:04:59.360 --> 02:05:02.360
We've got an email.

02:05:03.360 --> 02:05:04.360
She hit the wall hard.

02:05:05.360 --> 02:05:06.360
Reef blend.

02:05:07.360 --> 02:05:09.360
She's not supposed to be rude.

02:05:09.360 --> 02:05:10.360
Examination.

02:05:10.360 --> 02:05:11.360
Dear miss.

02:05:12.360 --> 02:05:13.360
Miss Nova.

02:05:13.360 --> 02:05:16.360
Just as the prime minister leaves the weather is getting even more.

02:05:17.360 --> 02:05:18.360
Cancel the meeting.

02:05:22.360 --> 02:05:23.360
He canceled the meeting.

02:05:23.360 --> 02:05:24.360
What is that?

02:05:26.360 --> 02:05:27.360
What does it mean?

02:05:28.360 --> 02:05:29.360
Right, listen.

02:05:31.360 --> 02:05:33.360
Nina's got a patient number.

02:05:35.360 --> 02:05:36.360
Not a strong word.

02:05:37.360 --> 02:05:39.360
There are no pathological findings.

02:05:40.360 --> 02:05:41.360
Oh, okay.

02:05:41.360 --> 02:05:42.360
She's got blood tests done.

02:05:43.360 --> 02:05:44.360
Wait, she's got a new, new name?

02:05:45.360 --> 02:05:46.360
Miss Nova.

02:05:47.360 --> 02:05:48.360
Ooh, we got it.

02:05:51.360 --> 02:05:53.360
We're hacking into her medical database.

02:06:00.360 --> 02:06:02.360
This is her private information.

02:06:03.360 --> 02:06:05.360
Well, that's where she lives.

02:06:07.360 --> 02:06:08.360
I've got her leg.

02:06:08.360 --> 02:06:09.360
Perfect.

02:06:09.360 --> 02:06:11.360
And address is always helpful.

02:06:11.360 --> 02:06:12.360
I've got her leg.

02:06:14.360 --> 02:06:15.360
Has injury on life.

02:06:15.360 --> 02:06:16.360
Like a medical leave.

02:06:17.360 --> 02:06:20.360
I saw a medical leave until April.

02:06:21.360 --> 02:06:22.360
Show conflict.

02:06:23.360 --> 02:06:24.360
She's been employed.

02:06:26.360 --> 02:06:29.360
Pain is mostly due to a prior infected wound.

02:06:30.360 --> 02:06:31.360
Compressment damaging.

02:06:32.360 --> 02:06:35.360
Sometimes we're similar to those of Mara.

02:06:36.360 --> 02:06:41.360
The patient has been strongly advised to favor the leg

02:06:41.360 --> 02:06:42.360
to avoid complications.

02:06:43.360 --> 02:06:45.360
Prescribe take two times a day.

02:06:45.360 --> 02:06:47.360
Advise patient to come back if symptoms don't improve.

02:06:48.360 --> 02:06:50.360
I don't know what to do.

02:06:55.360 --> 02:06:56.360
That's illegal.

02:06:57.360 --> 02:07:00.360
Infidels used by religious people to differentiate

02:07:00.360 --> 02:07:02.360
between people who are not part of the religious.

02:07:02.360 --> 02:07:03.360
Yeah, I found that.

02:07:04.360 --> 02:07:07.360
Hello there little jewel bug.

02:07:08.360 --> 02:07:09.360
Welcome to Tech June.

02:07:09.360 --> 02:07:10.360
It's so great to hear you.

02:07:10.360 --> 02:07:11.360
Yeah, you too.

02:07:11.360 --> 02:07:12.360
That's why I called.

02:07:12.360 --> 02:07:13.360
It was about time.

02:07:15.360 --> 02:07:17.360
Did you know I was working today?

02:07:18.360 --> 02:07:20.360
Sorry, I forgot for a second.

02:07:20.360 --> 02:07:21.360
You actually know me.

02:07:21.360 --> 02:07:22.360
Feeling stressed.

02:07:22.360 --> 02:07:23.360
Boss causing trouble.

02:07:23.360 --> 02:07:24.360
I can call back.

02:07:24.360 --> 02:07:25.360
Oh, no, no, no.

02:07:25.360 --> 02:07:27.360
Hanging around the office just as who's, you know,

02:07:27.360 --> 02:07:28.360
not to be at home.

02:07:28.360 --> 02:07:29.360
I see.

02:07:29.360 --> 02:07:31.360
I never got why you moved back and then the first place.

02:07:31.360 --> 02:07:33.360
I had to leave my student apartment.

02:07:33.360 --> 02:07:34.360
You know that.

02:07:34.360 --> 02:07:37.360
And you know that a super lame excuse.

02:07:37.360 --> 02:07:39.360
You earned good money at the tech.

02:07:39.360 --> 02:07:40.360
Don't you?

02:07:40.360 --> 02:07:41.360
You could rent a flat in town.

02:07:41.360 --> 02:07:42.360
You just don't want to.

02:07:43.360 --> 02:07:45.360
I see you're not going to relent.

02:07:46.360 --> 02:07:47.360
Nope.

02:07:47.360 --> 02:07:48.360
Sorry.

02:07:48.360 --> 02:07:49.360
I had a pretty rough start into this year.

02:07:49.360 --> 02:07:51.360
I couldn't really stand being alone at the time.

02:07:52.360 --> 02:07:53.360
I feel,

02:07:54.360 --> 02:07:55.360
I feel much better now,

02:07:55.360 --> 02:07:57.360
but mum, dad, they're so happy I'm back.

02:07:57.360 --> 02:07:58.360
I don't want to disappoint them.

02:07:58.360 --> 02:07:59.360
Oh, you don't want to.

02:07:59.360 --> 02:08:00.360
Yeah.

02:08:00.360 --> 02:08:01.360
I can't do that to them.

02:08:01.360 --> 02:08:02.360
Not again.

02:08:02.360 --> 02:08:03.360
And I hear, I,

02:08:03.360 --> 02:08:05.360
and I hear,

02:08:05.360 --> 02:08:06.360
I was thinking,

02:08:07.360 --> 02:08:08.360
I think that's the wrong spell in here.

02:08:08.360 --> 02:08:09.360
I'm like,

02:08:09.360 --> 02:08:10.360
I have.

02:08:10.360 --> 02:08:11.360
No, you haven't.

02:08:11.360 --> 02:08:13.360
You're letting yourself be hassled by mum and dad yet again.

02:08:13.360 --> 02:08:14.360
It's the sister.

02:08:17.360 --> 02:08:18.360
It's the sister.

02:08:18.360 --> 02:08:19.360
They're sisters.

02:08:20.360 --> 02:08:21.360
Wait, what?

02:08:21.360 --> 02:08:22.360
No.

02:08:22.360 --> 02:08:23.360
You're letting yourself be hassled by mum and dad again.

02:08:23.360 --> 02:08:24.360
What?

02:08:24.360 --> 02:08:25.360
I'm so confused.

02:08:25.360 --> 02:08:26.360
Yeah.

02:08:26.360 --> 02:08:28.360
I'm so envious when dad called you his little June bug.

02:08:30.360 --> 02:08:31.360
No, what?

02:08:31.360 --> 02:08:32.360
Am I going crazy?

02:08:32.360 --> 02:08:34.360
They have two different surnames.

02:08:36.360 --> 02:08:37.360
But office is empty.

02:08:37.360 --> 02:08:39.360
Yeah, my to-do list is so long.

02:08:39.360 --> 02:08:41.360
Okay, let's talk another time.

02:08:41.360 --> 02:08:42.360
I will call you again.

02:08:42.360 --> 02:08:44.360
Do not try to reach me.

02:08:44.360 --> 02:08:45.360
Ha ha ha.

02:08:45.360 --> 02:08:46.360
Just kidding.

02:08:46.360 --> 02:08:47.360
June?

02:08:47.360 --> 02:08:48.360
Yep.

02:08:48.360 --> 02:08:50.360
Thank you for holding me.

02:08:50.360 --> 02:08:52.360
Aw, look at you sending so seriously.

02:08:52.360 --> 02:08:53.360
Wait, am I going crazy?

02:08:56.360 --> 02:08:58.360
Who the fuck is June bug?

02:08:59.360 --> 02:09:01.360
See you around June bug.

02:09:05.360 --> 02:09:07.360
And she's calling her June.

02:09:08.360 --> 02:09:09.360
June bug.

02:09:09.360 --> 02:09:10.360
What weird nickname is that?

02:09:10.360 --> 02:09:12.360
It's just a nickname.

02:09:12.360 --> 02:09:13.360
Alia.

02:09:13.360 --> 02:09:14.360
What?

02:09:14.360 --> 02:09:16.360
Who the heck is Nina?

02:09:16.360 --> 02:09:19.360
So why is Nina not getting active?

02:09:19.360 --> 02:09:21.360
It's a pretty rough start to this y'all.

02:09:21.360 --> 02:09:23.360
I was working today.

02:09:23.360 --> 02:09:26.360
June and June bug had their sister through the chat.

02:09:26.360 --> 02:09:27.360
Oh, right.

02:09:27.360 --> 02:09:28.360
Okay, I knew it.

02:09:29.360 --> 02:09:30.360
What are you looking at?

02:09:31.360 --> 02:09:32.360
Remarried?

02:09:33.360 --> 02:09:34.360
One might be married.

02:09:38.360 --> 02:09:39.360
I'm confused.

02:09:39.360 --> 02:09:40.360
Sorry, I need to take my bra off.

02:09:42.360 --> 02:09:43.360
I'm not comfy.

02:09:43.360 --> 02:09:44.360
Sorry to bring that over nowhere.

02:09:44.360 --> 02:09:45.360
I'm not comfy in it.

02:09:45.360 --> 02:09:46.360
I need to take it off.

02:09:47.360 --> 02:09:48.360
Get this bait.

02:09:48.360 --> 02:09:49.360
I shed off a bait.

02:09:54.360 --> 02:09:56.360
Oh, it's a fucking sports bra.

02:09:58.360 --> 02:10:01.360
So it pushes down against my chest when I breathe.

02:10:07.360 --> 02:10:09.360
Doesn't one of them have two wings?

02:10:14.360 --> 02:10:16.360
Okay, let me hydrate with some water.

02:10:16.360 --> 02:10:17.360
Please do hydrate as well.

02:10:17.360 --> 02:10:20.360
What we'll do is we'll play until Emmy comes on

02:10:20.360 --> 02:10:24.360
or my brain short fuses out.

02:10:24.360 --> 02:10:26.360
It turns into a coat wreck.

02:10:26.360 --> 02:10:27.360
More like turns into the carpet.

02:10:27.360 --> 02:10:29.360
It's on the floor right now.

02:10:33.360 --> 02:10:35.360
You got the last two hours for me.

02:10:35.360 --> 02:10:38.360
Oh, my reading comprehension is out the window already though.

02:10:38.360 --> 02:10:40.360
I think what we'll do, we'll finish up this chapter

02:10:40.360 --> 02:10:43.360
and I'll just, I'll redirect into their ASMR video

02:10:43.360 --> 02:10:44.360
because it's so cute.

02:10:50.360 --> 02:10:51.360
So that's what she said.

02:10:51.360 --> 02:10:54.360
So that's what she received,

02:10:54.360 --> 02:10:57.360
but we have evidence that we're working.

02:11:04.360 --> 02:11:06.360
How could she be working

02:11:06.360 --> 02:11:10.360
and she's been given medical leave?

02:11:12.360 --> 02:11:13.360
No.

02:11:13.360 --> 02:11:15.360
Has worked in multiple jobs during the week.

02:11:15.360 --> 02:11:16.360
Right.

02:11:16.360 --> 02:11:20.360
Well, unless she's committing frauds.

02:11:21.360 --> 02:11:24.360
She may have had an injury, but she's working.

02:11:24.360 --> 02:11:27.360
So, so she was working a lot.

02:11:27.360 --> 02:11:30.360
Does that account for ability of committing the bomb?

02:11:30.360 --> 02:11:31.360
I'm not sure.

02:11:31.360 --> 02:11:33.360
I'm not sure either.

02:11:33.360 --> 02:11:35.360
Is there something else here?

02:11:35.360 --> 02:11:36.360
Sure.

02:11:36.360 --> 02:11:38.360
It's still the leg injury.

02:11:38.360 --> 02:11:40.360
She may have an oopsie again.

02:11:40.360 --> 02:11:41.360
Oopsie, oopsie, oopsie.

02:11:41.360 --> 02:11:43.360
That info came in handy though.

02:11:43.360 --> 02:11:45.360
That info came in handy though.

02:11:45.360 --> 02:11:47.360
That info came in handy though.

02:11:47.360 --> 02:11:49.360
That info came in handy though.

02:11:49.360 --> 02:11:51.360
That info came in handy though.

02:11:56.360 --> 02:11:57.360
Initiate.

02:11:57.360 --> 02:11:58.360
Initiate.

02:11:58.360 --> 02:12:00.360
Wait, he's talking to her now?

02:12:07.360 --> 02:12:09.360
Not in the mood for knock knock jokes.

02:12:09.360 --> 02:12:11.360
Oh, you blew it.

02:12:11.360 --> 02:12:13.360
Oh, cut the crap.

02:12:13.360 --> 02:12:15.360
Who are you?

02:12:15.360 --> 02:12:17.360
So now you can't ask.

02:12:20.360 --> 02:12:24.360
Initiate is the name in contact with Initiate.

02:12:24.360 --> 02:12:28.360
I'm gonna go beat my dad up and tell him to shut the fuck up on the phone.

02:12:28.360 --> 02:12:30.360
I quote the other side of this.

02:12:30.360 --> 02:12:32.360
Then initiate again.

02:12:32.360 --> 02:12:35.360
I wonder what his or her role is.

02:12:35.360 --> 02:12:37.360
Well, let's find out.

02:12:37.360 --> 02:12:40.360
Initiate has been in contact with two of our target persons so far.

02:12:40.360 --> 02:12:41.360
There should be enough.

02:12:41.360 --> 02:12:42.360
And here we go.

02:12:42.360 --> 02:12:44.360
Feel free to investigate this hacker well,

02:12:44.360 --> 02:12:46.360
but keep the focus on the whammin'.

02:12:46.360 --> 02:12:48.360
So she's blocked him.

02:12:50.360 --> 02:12:51.360
Oh, not again.

02:12:51.360 --> 02:12:52.360
You're from Singular, right?

02:12:52.360 --> 02:12:54.360
Don't care how you got my number.

02:12:54.360 --> 02:12:56.360
Oh, no, that's the one from Session Closed.

02:12:57.360 --> 02:13:00.360
Oh, he started up again even though she blocked him?

02:13:00.360 --> 02:13:01.360
Yelling your name again?

02:13:01.360 --> 02:13:03.360
Oh, he freaking talks to my mum.

02:13:03.360 --> 02:13:05.360
And he's like legal name, legal name, legal name.

02:13:05.360 --> 02:13:07.360
And I'm like, well, buzz the duck off.

02:13:08.360 --> 02:13:13.360
You should listen to me just for a moment, all right?

02:13:13.360 --> 02:13:14.360
And then it's all gone.

02:13:14.360 --> 02:13:16.360
I don't care what you have to say.

02:13:18.360 --> 02:13:20.360
See, I know about your little band of troublemakers,

02:13:20.360 --> 02:13:22.360
and I really dig it.

02:13:26.360 --> 02:13:27.360
The government,

02:13:27.360 --> 02:13:29.360
sorry, I'm gonna make myself a wee bit weird,

02:13:29.360 --> 02:13:30.360
so I'm not in the way.

02:13:33.360 --> 02:13:35.360
The government needs to know that.

02:13:36.360 --> 02:13:38.360
The government needs to kick where the sun don't shine.

02:13:38.360 --> 02:13:40.360
So he's anti-government.

02:13:40.360 --> 02:13:41.360
Okay, yeah.

02:13:41.360 --> 02:13:43.360
That's all right with me, sweetie.

02:13:43.360 --> 02:13:45.360
But bombing people, that's plain wrong.

02:13:45.360 --> 02:13:46.360
What?

02:13:46.360 --> 02:13:48.360
How come you think it was one of us?

02:13:48.360 --> 02:13:50.360
Let's just say I've been watching you all for some time.

02:13:50.360 --> 02:13:54.360
The bomb bar hit places where your outlawed posse

02:13:54.360 --> 02:13:57.360
have been no way you did not hear about that.

02:13:57.360 --> 02:14:00.360
You are extremely lucky that the cops were stupid enough

02:14:00.360 --> 02:14:03.360
not to have figured that connection yet.

02:14:03.360 --> 02:14:06.360
Else they might have prevented the mall thingy.

02:14:06.360 --> 02:14:09.360
Me, who could have maybe done the mall thing.

02:14:12.360 --> 02:14:14.360
Oh, he misses her here.

02:14:14.360 --> 02:14:15.360
How do you threaten me?

02:14:15.360 --> 02:14:16.360
I got none.

02:14:16.360 --> 02:14:17.360
So give me two reasons.

02:14:17.360 --> 02:14:18.360
You know, like,

02:14:18.360 --> 02:14:20.360
put your conscience of mine at ease if you want to.

02:14:20.360 --> 02:14:21.360
Yolanda, be cool.

02:14:21.360 --> 02:14:23.360
I said I want to help after all,

02:14:23.360 --> 02:14:24.360
not threaten you.

02:14:24.360 --> 02:14:25.360
Her name's Yolanda.

02:14:25.360 --> 02:14:27.360
No, her name's not Yolanda.

02:14:27.360 --> 02:14:29.360
I'll show you how you do it.

02:14:29.360 --> 02:14:31.360
I'm gonna hack that precious page.

02:14:33.360 --> 02:14:35.360
And upload something special.

02:14:35.360 --> 02:14:37.360
It's gonna be easy with those...

02:14:37.360 --> 02:14:38.360
He dares?

02:14:38.360 --> 02:14:39.360
Wow.

02:14:39.360 --> 02:14:42.360
The it guys are gonna make short work of that rookie.

02:14:44.360 --> 02:14:46.360
Don't care about your shit.

02:14:46.360 --> 02:14:47.360
Wait, wait, wait.

02:14:49.360 --> 02:14:51.360
Sorry, my dad's talking.

02:14:51.360 --> 02:14:52.360
We'll have to mute once like...

02:14:52.360 --> 02:14:53.360
Oh wait, we'll do this bit

02:14:53.360 --> 02:14:56.360
and then I'm gonna fucking go spank him.

02:14:56.360 --> 02:14:57.360
Wait, wait, give me a second.

02:14:57.360 --> 02:14:58.360
Will I get to work?

02:14:58.360 --> 02:14:59.360
Don't go, wait.

02:14:59.360 --> 02:15:00.360
If I could get away from you, I could.

02:15:00.360 --> 02:15:02.360
I can't switch my phone off now.

02:15:02.360 --> 02:15:03.360
That is a nice looking firewall.

02:15:03.360 --> 02:15:05.360
You have their dear party web team.

02:15:05.360 --> 02:15:08.360
It would be a shame if someone would just bypass it.

02:15:08.360 --> 02:15:10.360
Can you actually shut up?

02:15:13.360 --> 02:15:14.360
We can't even hear him.

02:15:14.360 --> 02:15:16.360
I know, but I'm just worried he like fucking...

02:15:16.360 --> 02:15:17.360
You know when like, fuck around the phone

02:15:17.360 --> 02:15:19.360
and they wander up and down the hallway.

02:15:19.360 --> 02:15:20.360
I'm scared of him doing that.

02:15:20.360 --> 02:15:22.360
I'm being right outside the door.

02:15:22.360 --> 02:15:24.360
Doing this still gives me chills

02:15:24.360 --> 02:15:25.360
and needs to distract myself.

02:15:25.360 --> 02:15:26.360
Sheesh, almost done.

02:15:26.360 --> 02:15:28.360
Just a second longer.

02:15:32.360 --> 02:15:33.360
What the heck?

02:15:35.360 --> 02:15:37.360
Oh, shit, man.

02:15:40.360 --> 02:15:43.360
They reinforce their huge gaping look.

02:15:43.360 --> 02:15:44.360
Oh, it just vanished.

02:15:44.360 --> 02:15:46.360
It's almost like somebody warned them.

02:15:47.360 --> 02:15:48.360
Yeah, whatever.

02:15:48.360 --> 02:15:49.360
Goodbye, initiative.

02:15:50.360 --> 02:15:52.360
It's initiate and wait.

02:15:56.360 --> 02:15:58.360
I'm gonna spam you for the rest of your day

02:15:58.360 --> 02:16:00.360
if you don't answer my question.

02:16:01.360 --> 02:16:03.360
It's funny you're watching us when we shower.

02:16:03.360 --> 02:16:04.360
You want me to?

02:16:04.360 --> 02:16:06.360
Or do you want me to admit to it?

02:16:07.360 --> 02:16:09.360
Well, hell, will you leave me alone

02:16:09.360 --> 02:16:11.360
and quit poking around my life?

02:16:11.360 --> 02:16:12.360
You said you were not involved in this.

02:16:12.360 --> 02:16:13.360
Oh, I'm not.

02:16:13.360 --> 02:16:14.360
Okay, okay.

02:16:14.360 --> 02:16:16.360
Do you think it's someone else?

02:16:16.360 --> 02:16:17.360
Thought.

02:16:17.360 --> 02:16:19.360
The band of misfits? Nah.

02:16:23.360 --> 02:16:24.360
Harrison is the only guy

02:16:24.360 --> 02:16:27.360
I could remotely imagine doing anything like that.

02:16:27.360 --> 02:16:28.360
Okay, no.

02:16:31.360 --> 02:16:34.360
Harrison had an interest in...

02:16:34.360 --> 02:16:36.360
Hmm, does she know more than we do

02:16:36.360 --> 02:16:38.360
or is it a random question?

02:16:38.360 --> 02:16:40.360
Harrison had an interest in Cassandra

02:16:40.360 --> 02:16:43.360
because she's got big money.

02:16:43.360 --> 02:16:44.360
Sure.

02:16:45.360 --> 02:16:46.360
Submit that.

02:16:49.360 --> 02:16:51.360
Must be crushing when your friends

02:16:51.360 --> 02:16:53.360
only like you for Yamoola.

02:16:53.360 --> 02:16:56.360
Juliet was a bit shy, but good at organizing.

02:16:56.360 --> 02:16:57.360
So...

02:16:59.360 --> 02:17:02.360
You know what I think is the gov themselves?

02:17:02.360 --> 02:17:05.360
I love a good self-insert plot.

02:17:05.360 --> 02:17:07.360
Sorry, but I'm putting that down.

02:17:07.360 --> 02:17:08.360
I thought about that.

02:17:08.360 --> 02:17:10.360
Did you know that...

02:17:10.360 --> 02:17:11.360
What a joke.

02:17:11.360 --> 02:17:13.360
Of course the government

02:17:13.360 --> 02:17:15.360
to justify surveillance, right?

02:17:15.360 --> 02:17:16.360
I've heard that million times right now.

02:17:16.360 --> 02:17:17.360
Every time something happens

02:17:17.360 --> 02:17:19.360
there's nothing to these conspiracies.

02:17:20.360 --> 02:17:21.360
Did you know that since the

02:17:21.360 --> 02:17:23.360
electronic must have unique IDs

02:17:23.360 --> 02:17:24.360
they look like this

02:17:24.360 --> 02:17:26.360
and it's not even secure?

02:17:28.360 --> 02:17:30.360
Well, that's because it is what?

02:17:30.360 --> 02:17:31.360
Don't worry, I've only...

02:17:31.360 --> 02:17:32.360
Oh, very good.

02:17:32.360 --> 02:17:33.360
You've found a device.

02:17:33.360 --> 02:17:35.360
Every device in the nation has one in the court

02:17:35.360 --> 02:17:37.360
but that's literally what they're talking about.

02:17:37.360 --> 02:17:40.360
We can use the insider tool to connect

02:17:40.360 --> 02:17:42.360
to see what the user has on the device.

02:17:42.360 --> 02:17:44.360
The device must be running it online.

02:17:44.360 --> 02:17:46.360
Don't worry, I only access the number remotely.

02:17:46.360 --> 02:17:48.360
Nothing more you deserve.

02:17:48.360 --> 02:17:50.360
First, you threaten me.

02:17:50.360 --> 02:17:51.360
Now this will do.

02:17:51.360 --> 02:17:53.360
Initiate recognizes this will help.

02:17:54.360 --> 02:17:55.360
His help is not one...

02:17:55.360 --> 02:17:58.360
Yeah, if only you would session close.

02:17:59.360 --> 02:18:01.360
I can see her desktop.

02:18:02.360 --> 02:18:04.360
What's in the trash?

02:18:04.360 --> 02:18:06.360
Request for carving jobs.

02:18:06.360 --> 02:18:07.360
Okay, so I was right.

02:18:07.360 --> 02:18:08.360
She was doing the jobs.

02:18:09.360 --> 02:18:10.360
That's fine.

02:18:10.360 --> 02:18:13.360
Let me just check all the things in the trash.

02:18:14.360 --> 02:18:16.360
Take over the freedom shift.

02:18:18.360 --> 02:18:19.360
Oh.

02:18:19.360 --> 02:18:21.360
Okay, so no matter how much privacy

02:18:21.360 --> 02:18:23.360
you've got, the government already knows.

02:18:25.360 --> 02:18:26.360
Put your tinfoil hat on

02:18:26.360 --> 02:18:28.360
and let's just call ourselves crazy.

02:18:29.360 --> 02:18:31.360
My phone number is a strip.

02:18:33.360 --> 02:18:35.360
We've got a phone number as well.

02:18:37.360 --> 02:18:38.360
Got everything on her.

02:18:38.360 --> 02:18:39.360
Wait, hold on.

02:18:39.360 --> 02:18:41.360
Desktop, private.

02:18:41.360 --> 02:18:43.360
An apology and an offer.

02:18:46.360 --> 02:18:47.360
Oh, okay, okay.

02:18:47.360 --> 02:18:48.360
Abraham email.

02:18:48.360 --> 02:18:49.360
I'll take it.

02:18:49.360 --> 02:18:50.360
I'll take it.

02:18:50.360 --> 02:18:52.360
Okay, I'll take an email.

02:18:52.360 --> 02:18:53.360
I just realized,

02:18:53.360 --> 02:18:55.360
have I got green artifact in around me?

02:18:56.360 --> 02:18:57.360
No.

02:18:59.360 --> 02:19:00.360
I think I'm fine.

02:19:00.360 --> 02:19:01.360
Sorry.

02:19:01.360 --> 02:19:03.360
When I record, I have to do...

02:19:03.360 --> 02:19:04.360
When I record for like shorts, I have to do...

02:19:04.360 --> 02:19:06.360
Sorry, that was like jump scare

02:19:06.360 --> 02:19:07.360
just out of nowhere.

02:19:09.360 --> 02:19:11.360
When I record shorts,

02:19:11.360 --> 02:19:13.360
I have to do a transparent layer

02:19:13.360 --> 02:19:15.360
and I thought I had it there,

02:19:15.360 --> 02:19:16.360
but it's just because I'm so zoomed.

02:19:16.360 --> 02:19:17.360
Oh, sorry.

02:19:17.360 --> 02:19:19.360
I forget that I'm not supposed to show that part.

02:19:21.360 --> 02:19:22.360
Okay, here we go.

02:19:26.360 --> 02:19:28.360
Is your hair bun wearing the tinfoil hat?

02:19:28.360 --> 02:19:29.360
Exactly.

02:19:29.360 --> 02:19:31.360
Look, it fits perfectly.

02:19:33.360 --> 02:19:34.360
I suggest that we talk.

02:19:34.360 --> 02:19:38.360
Received an offer of assistance by Abraham.

02:19:38.360 --> 02:19:40.360
It's in contact with each other.

02:19:40.360 --> 02:19:41.360
Okay.

02:19:41.360 --> 02:19:43.360
We'll keep that.

02:19:45.360 --> 02:19:47.360
Assist each other with what exactly?

02:19:47.360 --> 02:19:48.360
Do not read.

02:19:49.360 --> 02:19:51.360
I'll embarrass a male.

02:19:53.360 --> 02:19:55.360
Pass the part of a relationship?

02:19:55.360 --> 02:19:56.360
She's interrel-

02:19:56.360 --> 02:19:57.360
So I might as well write down

02:19:57.360 --> 02:19:58.360
what I've been trying to say in time.

02:19:58.360 --> 02:19:59.360
I love you.

02:19:59.360 --> 02:20:01.360
Oh, wait, what?

02:20:01.360 --> 02:20:04.360
Every cell in me wants to just backspace

02:20:04.360 --> 02:20:06.360
or not send a...

02:20:06.360 --> 02:20:10.360
Oh, she's in love with him.

02:20:10.360 --> 02:20:11.360
And not just the son,

02:20:11.360 --> 02:20:13.360
even though her backpack tripled on him.

02:20:13.360 --> 02:20:14.360
Okay, so she's in love,

02:20:14.360 --> 02:20:16.360
but he didn't reciprocate

02:20:16.360 --> 02:20:19.360
and she spawned a wane because of it.

02:20:19.360 --> 02:20:20.360
Like her a-

02:20:20.360 --> 02:20:22.360
So she isn't single after all?

02:20:22.360 --> 02:20:24.360
She pretends to be?

02:20:26.360 --> 02:20:28.360
That's her with a wane.

02:20:30.360 --> 02:20:31.360
Desmo?

02:20:31.360 --> 02:20:32.360
Yeah, you like that.

02:20:32.360 --> 02:20:33.360
Yeah, you like that.

02:20:33.360 --> 02:20:34.360
Don't you?

02:20:36.360 --> 02:20:37.360
Girl, I like your face.

02:20:37.360 --> 02:20:38.360
Come again.

02:20:38.360 --> 02:20:40.360
Kids being the center of my life.

02:20:43.360 --> 02:20:45.360
Squad?

02:20:45.360 --> 02:20:46.360
What?

02:20:46.360 --> 02:20:48.360
She's an army veteran?

02:20:48.360 --> 02:20:51.360
Whoa, but look, the symbol on her tank.

02:20:51.360 --> 02:20:52.360
The symbol on her tank

02:20:52.360 --> 02:20:54.360
is what she used on the website.

02:20:56.360 --> 02:20:57.360
Oh my God.

02:20:57.360 --> 02:20:59.360
As an ex-soldier?

02:20:59.360 --> 02:21:01.360
We need to specify

02:21:01.360 --> 02:21:02.360
specifically know

02:21:02.360 --> 02:21:05.360
what kind of experience she has.

02:21:05.360 --> 02:21:07.360
That's cute.

02:21:08.360 --> 02:21:10.360
Headlines, what's going on?

02:21:10.360 --> 02:21:12.360
Headlines, isn't it?

02:21:12.360 --> 02:21:13.360
Harrison's timeline?

02:21:13.360 --> 02:21:15.360
It's on you here?

02:21:22.360 --> 02:21:24.360
That's why you kept it quiet for so long.

02:21:24.360 --> 02:21:26.360
What the hell, the big revolution cell

02:21:26.360 --> 02:21:28.360
is a lack of peer-to-peer.

02:21:28.360 --> 02:21:29.360
I feel you.

02:21:29.360 --> 02:21:31.360
When the TNB called on me

02:21:31.360 --> 02:21:32.360
and asked if I would write for them,

02:21:32.360 --> 02:21:34.360
I laughed in 30 minutes.

02:21:35.360 --> 02:21:37.360
But they called me again to let me know

02:21:37.360 --> 02:21:38.360
I could write whatever I want.

02:21:38.360 --> 02:21:39.360
No strings to hell.

02:21:39.360 --> 02:21:40.360
I can even swear, and I do.

02:21:41.360 --> 02:21:43.360
Well, good luck with an article like that.

02:21:43.360 --> 02:21:45.360
You could not be any further away.

02:21:49.360 --> 02:21:51.360
Hmm, so he actually

02:21:51.360 --> 02:21:53.360
posted it proudly.

02:21:53.360 --> 02:21:55.360
I'm getting so confused with him.

02:21:57.360 --> 02:21:59.360
Fuckin' hell, that was her.

02:21:59.360 --> 02:22:00.360
What the?

02:22:02.360 --> 02:22:04.360
Is that guy from Fende?

02:22:04.360 --> 02:22:05.360
He's from Guerrilla.

02:22:05.360 --> 02:22:07.360
Nice, it sits there.

02:22:07.360 --> 02:22:08.360
Okay.

02:22:09.360 --> 02:22:11.360
Well, it's very important to know

02:22:11.360 --> 02:22:13.360
we're dealing with a combat veteran.

02:22:14.360 --> 02:22:16.360
She's specialised in a few things.

02:22:22.360 --> 02:22:24.360
Combat engineer,

02:22:24.360 --> 02:22:26.360
bravery medal,

02:22:26.360 --> 02:22:29.360
dishonourable discharge

02:22:29.360 --> 02:22:31.360
and three months of confinement

02:22:31.360 --> 02:22:33.360
for being AWOL

02:22:33.360 --> 02:22:35.360
with voluntary return.

02:22:36.360 --> 02:22:38.360
That's something to note down.

02:22:40.360 --> 02:22:42.360
Absence without official leave.

02:22:42.360 --> 02:22:43.360
That's a severe punishment.

02:22:43.360 --> 02:22:44.360
Oh, is it?

02:22:44.360 --> 02:22:45.360
Because she fell in love with him

02:22:45.360 --> 02:22:47.360
and went backpacking with him?

02:22:47.360 --> 02:22:48.360
I think so.

02:22:48.360 --> 02:22:50.360
Did you know this puts her on the same level

02:22:50.360 --> 02:22:52.360
as any previous convicted felon?

02:22:52.360 --> 02:22:53.360
Well...

02:22:55.360 --> 02:22:57.360
The nation.

02:22:57.360 --> 02:22:58.360
Harriers.

02:23:01.360 --> 02:23:03.360
Mission kebabs.

02:23:03.360 --> 02:23:05.360
Sorry, it does not say that at all.

02:23:06.360 --> 02:23:09.360
I'll just check out all the missions

02:23:09.360 --> 02:23:11.360
and cases,

02:23:11.360 --> 02:23:13.360
something in it,

02:23:13.360 --> 02:23:15.360
and it doesn't really look like that.

02:23:17.360 --> 02:23:19.360
Engineer, she might know how to pop her.

02:23:19.360 --> 02:23:21.360
Oh, actually, yeah, you're right.

02:23:21.360 --> 02:23:22.360
I should write that down.

02:23:22.360 --> 02:23:24.360
Write that down, write that down!

02:23:24.360 --> 02:23:26.360
Okay, so there's nothing.

02:23:27.360 --> 02:23:28.360
Okay.

02:23:28.360 --> 02:23:29.360
Let's do the news.

02:23:29.360 --> 02:23:31.360
Wait, no, let's do her.

02:23:33.360 --> 02:23:35.360
Of course, I can't even find it now.

02:23:35.360 --> 02:23:36.360
Memorial.

02:23:36.360 --> 02:23:38.360
Oh, this is sad.

02:23:47.360 --> 02:23:50.360
Her boyfriend passed away.

02:23:52.360 --> 02:23:55.360
That explains why she's a single mother.

02:23:57.360 --> 02:23:59.360
Initiated by the government,

02:23:59.360 --> 02:24:00.360
as much as I hate to say it,

02:24:00.360 --> 02:24:02.360
it definitely provides motivation to hate it.

02:24:02.360 --> 02:24:04.360
Find more to back that up.

02:24:04.360 --> 02:24:06.360
Aw, that's really sad.

02:24:08.360 --> 02:24:10.360
Oh dear, oh dear, oh dear.

02:24:10.360 --> 02:24:14.360
Right, let's report that you are a combat engineer.

02:24:14.360 --> 02:24:16.360
Same year as her discharge.

02:24:16.360 --> 02:24:18.360
Okay, so...

02:24:19.360 --> 02:24:21.360
Well, you know that she got the bravery.

02:24:21.360 --> 02:24:22.360
Ward, at least.

02:24:22.360 --> 02:24:24.360
And if he says it's a waste of time,

02:24:24.360 --> 02:24:25.360
he can pop his clogs.

02:24:25.360 --> 02:24:27.360
Seems to have come a long way

02:24:27.360 --> 02:24:29.360
from being such an honorable person.

02:24:29.360 --> 02:24:32.360
There's something on the missions that I missed.

02:24:37.360 --> 02:24:40.360
I've missed something on this page, apparently.

02:24:40.360 --> 02:24:42.360
I don't see it.

02:24:44.360 --> 02:24:46.360
I don't see it.

02:24:46.360 --> 02:24:47.360
It's here.

02:24:47.360 --> 02:24:48.360
What one is it?

02:24:48.360 --> 02:24:52.360
I'm scrolling, asking for the game to do it for me.

02:24:52.360 --> 02:24:54.360
Oh, there we go.

02:24:55.360 --> 02:24:59.360
Task with infrastructural maintenance during a thingy,

02:24:59.360 --> 02:25:02.360
but it's conflicting with something later.

02:25:03.360 --> 02:25:06.360
Why does this keep being highlighted?

02:25:06.360 --> 02:25:08.360
Previous entry.

02:25:11.360 --> 02:25:13.360
That's why she's ill.

02:25:13.360 --> 02:25:15.360
Like, she's got issues,

02:25:15.360 --> 02:25:17.360
because she's...

02:25:17.360 --> 02:25:19.360
Patient reports a permanent unrest

02:25:19.360 --> 02:25:21.360
that's suffering from...

02:25:21.360 --> 02:25:24.360
Patient tends to react aggressive when challenged.

02:25:24.360 --> 02:25:26.360
She has PTSD.

02:25:28.360 --> 02:25:29.360
Oh, right.

02:25:29.360 --> 02:25:31.360
Report the PTSD, because that's dangerous.

02:25:31.360 --> 02:25:34.360
PTSD is unbelievably dangerous.

02:25:34.360 --> 02:25:36.360
That sounds menacing and important,

02:25:36.360 --> 02:25:38.360
but I wonder what might have caused it.

02:25:38.360 --> 02:25:41.360
Well, she's a veteran.

02:25:41.360 --> 02:25:42.360
She's seen war?

02:25:42.360 --> 02:25:43.360
Hello?

02:25:43.360 --> 02:25:44.360
Are you serious?

02:25:44.360 --> 02:25:46.360
I wonder what caused it.

02:25:46.360 --> 02:25:48.360
Oh, look at that.

02:25:49.360 --> 02:25:53.360
So, how do we find what was conflicting in French, you know?

02:25:57.360 --> 02:25:59.360
I don't know what conflicting...

02:25:59.360 --> 02:26:01.360
I love how the music changes every time something shocking

02:26:01.360 --> 02:26:03.360
and important happens at school,

02:26:03.360 --> 02:26:04.360
not shell-shaped.

02:26:04.360 --> 02:26:07.360
And I probably heard her boyfriend perish in front of her.

02:26:07.360 --> 02:26:09.360
Mmm.

02:26:09.360 --> 02:26:11.360
She's covered wars, you know.

02:26:11.360 --> 02:26:13.360
Exactly.

02:26:13.360 --> 02:26:16.360
I can't find this...

02:26:16.360 --> 02:26:19.360
other thing that conflicts with this.

02:26:21.360 --> 02:26:22.360
Hmm.

02:26:22.360 --> 02:26:24.360
I'm missing something.

02:26:24.360 --> 02:26:25.360
I'm missing a lot of things.

02:26:25.360 --> 02:26:27.360
So, the mission's got the conflicting thing.

02:26:27.360 --> 02:26:29.360
So, what's in here?

02:26:31.360 --> 02:26:33.360
Yeah, it's up 5 to 12 times an hour,

02:26:33.360 --> 02:26:35.360
but does not feel overly tired.

02:26:35.360 --> 02:26:38.360
I mean, I'll just assume a lot of things.

02:26:39.360 --> 02:26:42.360
There's something I'm missing.

02:26:45.360 --> 02:26:47.360
Is there something I'm missing?

02:26:47.360 --> 02:26:49.360
I think I'm missing something.

02:26:51.360 --> 02:26:53.360
Ugh, nonsense.

02:26:56.360 --> 02:26:58.360
Is there anything else on this piece here?

02:27:00.360 --> 02:27:01.360
Oh, wait.

02:27:01.360 --> 02:27:03.360
I don't know what this is.

02:27:03.360 --> 02:27:05.360
System.

02:27:05.360 --> 02:27:06.360
Oh.

02:27:06.360 --> 02:27:08.360
CCTV.

02:27:08.360 --> 02:27:10.360
She looked up CCTV.

02:27:10.360 --> 02:27:12.360
Hmm.

02:27:12.360 --> 02:27:14.360
If we had a video...

02:27:14.360 --> 02:27:16.360
of Strone dying,

02:27:16.360 --> 02:27:18.360
we would have cried till the end of the stream.

02:27:19.360 --> 02:27:22.360
I watched Azura finish a...

02:27:22.360 --> 02:27:24.360
stray,

02:27:24.360 --> 02:27:26.360
and like her voice sounded quite sad.

02:27:26.360 --> 02:27:28.360
Me, who like burst out in her tears,

02:27:28.360 --> 02:27:30.360
like, ohhhh!

02:27:32.360 --> 02:27:34.360
I really am the crybaby.

02:27:34.360 --> 02:27:37.360
I was like, oh, this is the saddest thing I've ever played.

02:27:37.360 --> 02:27:38.360
Ohhhh!

02:27:38.360 --> 02:27:39.360
Like, greeting Miza.

02:27:39.360 --> 02:27:41.360
And Azura's just like, yeah.

02:27:41.360 --> 02:27:42.360
Oh, that's sad.

02:27:42.360 --> 02:27:44.360
Yeah, Azura's way stronger.

02:27:44.360 --> 02:27:46.360
That's another thing to start from.

02:27:46.360 --> 02:27:47.360
You have something sinister in mind.

02:27:47.360 --> 02:27:49.360
Not to be confused with the...

02:27:49.360 --> 02:27:51.360
the head beach of our sin sister.

02:27:53.360 --> 02:27:55.360
Yeah, we want something sinister.

02:27:55.360 --> 02:27:57.360
It's vaguely associated, you know,

02:27:57.360 --> 02:27:59.360
with the soul.

02:27:59.360 --> 02:28:01.360
This makes two locations.

02:28:01.360 --> 02:28:02.360
We will have a very solid case,

02:28:02.360 --> 02:28:04.360
so if we can make a third...

02:28:06.360 --> 02:28:08.360
singular thing, you're in.

02:28:12.360 --> 02:28:13.360
MomÃ¨.

02:28:13.360 --> 02:28:15.360
Yeah, we can move on.

02:28:18.360 --> 02:28:21.360
Okay, I don't think there was anything else we could extract out of this stuff.

02:28:24.360 --> 02:28:25.360
Right.

02:28:25.360 --> 02:28:27.360
There's something con...

02:28:27.360 --> 02:28:29.360
there's something...

02:28:29.360 --> 02:28:31.360
projects.

02:28:32.360 --> 02:28:34.360
It has become mandatory to inform employees

02:28:34.360 --> 02:28:37.360
whenever an applicant applies an ex-convict.

02:28:37.360 --> 02:28:40.360
Safety Bill prevents Nina from getting a job.

02:28:42.360 --> 02:28:43.360
Huh.

02:28:46.360 --> 02:28:49.360
So as you're considering she's on her own taking care of her son,

02:28:49.360 --> 02:28:51.360
it makes one hell of a motivation together

02:28:51.360 --> 02:28:54.360
with the fact Desmond was killed on a mission.

02:28:54.360 --> 02:28:56.360
Congrats, every name's Desmond!

02:28:56.360 --> 02:28:58.360
By the government.

02:28:59.360 --> 02:29:02.360
We have found a strong motivation revenge.

02:29:03.360 --> 02:29:06.360
But we haven't found the conflicting piece of information

02:29:06.360 --> 02:29:08.360
with this one here!

02:29:08.360 --> 02:29:09.360
Please!

02:29:10.360 --> 02:29:12.360
What's the conflict?

02:29:13.360 --> 02:29:15.360
I can't find it.

02:29:15.360 --> 02:29:16.360
No.

02:29:16.360 --> 02:29:18.360
Task with infrastructure maintenance.

02:29:20.360 --> 02:29:21.360
Hmm.

02:29:21.360 --> 02:29:23.360
It's an on-tri-PC.

02:29:29.360 --> 02:29:31.360
Where's it on your PC?

02:29:36.360 --> 02:29:38.360
Do not read infrastructure.

02:29:39.360 --> 02:29:41.360
Do not read...

02:29:41.360 --> 02:29:45.360
There's not going to be any active emails in it, is there?

02:29:46.360 --> 02:29:48.360
An earlier blog post.

02:29:48.360 --> 02:29:50.360
Let's have a little...

02:29:50.360 --> 02:29:52.360
scramble through this.

02:29:54.360 --> 02:29:55.360
Hmm.

02:29:56.360 --> 02:29:58.360
What can I access?

02:29:58.360 --> 02:30:00.360
Everything's archived on one page.

02:30:01.360 --> 02:30:02.360
Bye.

02:30:06.360 --> 02:30:10.360
I'm just checking if there's anything new that is...

02:30:10.360 --> 02:30:12.360
reachable.

02:30:13.360 --> 02:30:15.360
That doesn't really seem like it.

02:30:15.360 --> 02:30:17.360
Wait, what's the date in the letter?

02:30:17.360 --> 02:30:19.360
I'm pretty sure she wrote that after he died.

02:30:19.360 --> 02:30:21.360
It's probably...

02:30:21.360 --> 02:30:23.360
grief written letter.

02:30:24.360 --> 02:30:26.360
There's a lot of grief.

02:30:28.360 --> 02:30:32.360
Desmond Miles from the hit video game Assassin's Creed franchise?

02:30:35.360 --> 02:30:36.360
Hmm.

02:30:36.360 --> 02:30:38.360
I'm being pepega.

02:30:38.360 --> 02:30:40.360
I don't know what it is.

02:30:43.360 --> 02:30:46.360
I was checking out the jobs she could get.

02:30:46.360 --> 02:30:48.360
8 bucks an hour, that's rubbish.

02:30:49.360 --> 02:30:52.360
I don't want to do all the profile dumbass.

02:30:52.360 --> 02:30:55.360
Maintenance, works in cleaning maintenance.

02:30:55.360 --> 02:30:57.360
She can repair stuff.

02:30:57.360 --> 02:30:59.360
See recent employee feedback.

02:30:59.360 --> 02:31:01.360
We already submit for this.

02:31:01.360 --> 02:31:03.360
Hmm.

02:31:03.360 --> 02:31:05.360
I'm shy to this game.

02:31:07.360 --> 02:31:10.360
I don't know if I should just submit the one I can find,

02:31:10.360 --> 02:31:12.360
because I can't seem to find the other one.

02:31:13.360 --> 02:31:15.360
No.

02:31:15.360 --> 02:31:19.360
These are like such arbitrary...

02:31:19.360 --> 02:31:21.360
notes.

02:31:21.360 --> 02:31:23.360
I'm definitely...

02:31:23.360 --> 02:31:25.360
I'll just submit the job one.

02:31:25.360 --> 02:31:26.360
Why not?

02:31:26.360 --> 02:31:27.360
Right there, boom.

02:31:27.360 --> 02:31:29.360
You do all that.

02:31:29.360 --> 02:31:31.360
Upload complete.

02:31:31.360 --> 02:31:33.360
Okay, she's a handy handy gal.

02:31:33.360 --> 02:31:34.360
I'm not sure.

02:31:34.360 --> 02:31:36.360
You can work tons of nights and stuff.

02:31:36.360 --> 02:31:38.360
I don't know.

02:31:38.360 --> 02:31:40.360
Look at us working on the weekend.

02:31:40.360 --> 02:31:41.360
I get it.

02:31:41.360 --> 02:31:43.360
It's different, of course, when you're single, mother.

02:31:43.360 --> 02:31:44.360
That must be tough.

02:31:44.360 --> 02:31:46.360
Do you have any idea why she's doing this?

02:31:46.360 --> 02:31:48.360
What she aims for?

02:31:48.360 --> 02:31:50.360
Sun, sun, high table.

02:31:50.360 --> 02:31:53.360
Something, something, high table.

02:31:53.360 --> 02:31:56.360
Oh, so you can use it.

02:31:56.360 --> 02:31:58.360
I am very E.P.

02:31:58.360 --> 02:32:01.360
I am God's E.P.S. soldier for today.

02:32:01.360 --> 02:32:03.360
For once, it's not AC is the E.P.S. soldier.

02:32:03.360 --> 02:32:05.360
Did AC end up streaming?

02:32:05.360 --> 02:32:07.360
I knew she had a migraine.

02:32:07.360 --> 02:32:09.360
I don't know if she ended up finishing up.

02:32:11.360 --> 02:32:12.360
No, right.

02:32:12.360 --> 02:32:13.360
I'm doing it.

02:32:13.360 --> 02:32:14.360
I'm sending it.

02:32:14.360 --> 02:32:16.360
I can't seem to find wherever the conflict and information is,

02:32:16.360 --> 02:32:18.360
so I'm just sending it.

02:32:20.360 --> 02:32:22.360
So nothing noteworthy here.

02:32:22.360 --> 02:32:24.360
We know, we know, know enough,

02:32:24.360 --> 02:32:26.360
of our background.

02:32:30.360 --> 02:32:31.360
Was it another mission?

02:32:31.360 --> 02:32:33.360
It was probably another mission.

02:32:33.360 --> 02:32:34.360
A3.

02:32:37.360 --> 02:32:39.360
AC can't migraine to buddy.

02:32:39.360 --> 02:32:40.360
Yeah.

02:32:43.360 --> 02:32:44.360
Yes.

02:32:44.360 --> 02:32:45.360
Hey again, self here.

02:32:45.360 --> 02:32:46.360
How's it going?

02:32:46.360 --> 02:32:47.360
You feeling better?

02:32:47.360 --> 02:32:48.360
Yeah, somewhat.

02:32:48.360 --> 02:32:51.360
Finally, after spending the whole last week in bed.

02:32:55.360 --> 02:32:57.360
Oh God, I can bring Michael around though.

02:32:57.360 --> 02:32:58.360
Do you want?

02:32:58.360 --> 02:32:59.360
No, thanks.

02:32:59.360 --> 02:33:00.360
I'm going to pick him up in an hour.

02:33:00.360 --> 02:33:01.360
Would that be okay?

02:33:01.360 --> 02:33:02.360
Yeah, of course.

02:33:02.360 --> 02:33:04.360
I promise to go to the playground with him.

02:33:04.360 --> 02:33:05.360
That's fine.

02:33:05.360 --> 02:33:08.360
I'll pick Michael up from the corner at Orchard Drive.

02:33:09.360 --> 02:33:10.360
A location?

02:33:10.360 --> 02:33:13.360
Oh, we've got a location if we need to arrest her.

02:33:17.360 --> 02:33:19.360
No!

02:33:20.360 --> 02:33:22.360
That's such a good donor.

02:33:24.360 --> 02:33:26.360
No, that's such a good donor.

02:33:26.360 --> 02:33:28.360
Thank you, the disco opinion.

02:33:28.360 --> 02:33:30.360
Option, sorry, not opinion.

02:33:30.360 --> 02:33:32.360
The disco opinion.

02:33:32.360 --> 02:33:33.360
Option, fuck.

02:33:33.360 --> 02:33:34.360
The disco option.

02:33:34.360 --> 02:33:36.360
Thank you for the tip.

02:33:36.360 --> 02:33:37.360
Sorry, I'm out.

02:33:37.360 --> 02:33:38.360
Super chat shit.

02:33:38.360 --> 02:33:39.360
I'm fucking losing it.

02:33:39.360 --> 02:33:42.360
Okay, that might play a role there.

02:33:42.360 --> 02:33:44.360
That was such a good donor.

02:33:45.360 --> 02:33:48.360
Right, we've got spending in bed last week.

02:33:48.360 --> 02:33:50.360
I feel that's conflicting.

02:33:51.360 --> 02:33:53.360
We would like to inform you about new rate

02:33:53.360 --> 02:33:56.360
in McDougal Groundkeeping Services.

02:33:56.360 --> 02:33:57.360
Yippee!

02:34:03.360 --> 02:34:06.360
She was apparently there at the mall.

02:34:09.360 --> 02:34:12.360
So she worked at the site and even at the right time.

02:34:12.360 --> 02:34:15.360
She's worked at the right time at the other location.

02:34:15.360 --> 02:34:18.360
We have now been able to associate her with every location.

02:34:18.360 --> 02:34:20.360
Her whereabouts are hereby clarified.

02:34:20.360 --> 02:34:22.360
Things are not looking good for her.

02:34:23.360 --> 02:34:24.360
That's it.

02:34:24.360 --> 02:34:25.360
You've found all we need to know.

02:34:25.360 --> 02:34:26.360
Let's see.

02:34:26.360 --> 02:34:28.360
Myth, matter, nova.

02:34:28.360 --> 02:34:31.360
Simply engaged in maintenance tasks in the military.

02:34:31.360 --> 02:34:33.360
That doesn't seem notable.

02:34:33.360 --> 02:34:35.360
There's evidence that she has strong relations

02:34:35.360 --> 02:34:37.360
to hate the safety bill.

02:34:37.360 --> 02:34:40.360
And finally, we can associate her with every single

02:34:40.360 --> 02:34:42.360
bomb location to prove that she was present.

02:34:42.360 --> 02:34:44.360
Seems we've found her prime suspect.

02:34:44.360 --> 02:34:45.360
This is ground for arrest.

02:34:45.360 --> 02:34:47.360
I will need a moment to talk to my superiors.

02:34:47.360 --> 02:34:48.360
I'll get back soon.

02:34:48.360 --> 02:34:50.360
Keep observing, however.

02:34:50.360 --> 02:34:53.360
There's something here I've missed.

02:34:53.360 --> 02:34:54.360
But I don't.

02:34:54.360 --> 02:34:55.360
Oh, what's she doing?

02:34:55.360 --> 02:34:56.360
Yeah, I've got a PC.

02:34:56.360 --> 02:34:57.360
What are you doing?

02:34:59.360 --> 02:35:00.360
What are you doing?

02:35:00.360 --> 02:35:01.360
What are you trying to hide?

02:35:02.360 --> 02:35:03.360
What's your search history?

02:35:04.360 --> 02:35:06.360
What's your search history?

02:35:06.360 --> 02:35:07.360
No.

02:35:07.360 --> 02:35:09.360
Oh, sugar.

02:35:11.360 --> 02:35:14.360
She's talking to her synodona.

02:35:14.360 --> 02:35:15.360
Hey, Harry.

02:35:15.360 --> 02:35:16.360
Are you there?

02:35:20.360 --> 02:35:22.360
Oh, please.

02:35:22.360 --> 02:35:24.360
Is my name Ebenezer Scrooge?

02:35:24.360 --> 02:35:26.360
Why do all the ghosts in Christmas Pass

02:35:26.360 --> 02:35:27.360
come back and haunt me?

02:35:27.360 --> 02:35:28.360
Harry, I don't have time for this.

02:35:28.360 --> 02:35:29.360
I have a problem here.

02:35:29.360 --> 02:35:31.360
I need your tech knowledge for.

02:35:32.360 --> 02:35:35.360
Why doesn't anyone ever ask me about my problems?

02:35:35.360 --> 02:35:36.360
Oh, right.

02:35:36.360 --> 02:35:37.360
Why is it?

02:35:39.360 --> 02:35:40.360
I just came home.

02:35:44.360 --> 02:35:45.360
Da, da, da.

02:35:45.360 --> 02:35:48.360
And I had left my PC switched on this morning

02:35:48.360 --> 02:35:50.360
and I just tried to look something up online

02:35:50.360 --> 02:35:52.360
and suddenly it went all hair wire.

02:35:52.360 --> 02:35:54.360
And my security app popped up with like a million

02:35:54.360 --> 02:35:56.360
warnings from some intrusion.

02:35:56.360 --> 02:35:57.360
So I pulled the plug.

02:35:57.360 --> 02:35:58.360
Oh, no.

02:35:59.360 --> 02:36:01.360
Sounds like you already fixed the problem then.

02:36:06.360 --> 02:36:09.360
The thing is, I got contacted by a very strange guy earlier.

02:36:09.360 --> 02:36:10.360
I think he was some kind of hacker.

02:36:10.360 --> 02:36:12.360
And now he's hacking my PC.

02:36:13.360 --> 02:36:15.360
Geez, this guy is a new aunt.

02:36:15.360 --> 02:36:16.360
New aunt.

02:36:16.360 --> 02:36:17.360
New...

02:36:17.360 --> 02:36:18.360
New...

02:36:18.360 --> 02:36:19.360
New sense.

02:36:19.360 --> 02:36:20.360
New sense.

02:36:20.360 --> 02:36:21.360
Oh, my God.

02:36:21.360 --> 02:36:23.360
I think that guy already broken to my bank account as well.

02:36:23.360 --> 02:36:24.360
Oh, no.

02:36:24.360 --> 02:36:25.360
It's us.

02:36:25.360 --> 02:36:26.360
We're the baddie.

02:36:29.360 --> 02:36:30.360
I wonder who does it.

02:36:30.360 --> 02:36:32.360
I was contacted by that guy as well.

02:36:32.360 --> 02:36:34.360
He was blabbering about everything that we'd done in the past.

02:36:34.360 --> 02:36:36.360
And he would give our stuff away to the cops as usual.

02:36:37.360 --> 02:36:38.360
He told you that as well.

02:36:38.360 --> 02:36:39.360
What did you do?

02:36:39.360 --> 02:36:40.360
I told him that.

02:36:40.360 --> 02:36:41.360
F off.

02:36:41.360 --> 02:36:42.360
Who do you take me for?

02:36:43.360 --> 02:36:45.360
Do you think he really has something?

02:36:45.360 --> 02:36:47.360
I need to be sure he doesn't have a thing.

02:36:50.360 --> 02:36:52.360
Even if that guy had something,

02:36:52.360 --> 02:36:54.360
have you gotten your hands dirty?

02:36:54.360 --> 02:36:55.360
What's the fuzz about?

02:36:56.360 --> 02:36:57.360
What's the fuzz about?

02:36:57.360 --> 02:36:58.360
Who even says that?

02:36:58.360 --> 02:37:00.360
I need to get out of here before the cops are here.

02:37:00.360 --> 02:37:01.360
Whoo!

02:37:04.360 --> 02:37:09.360
Uh, she's what?

02:37:09.360 --> 02:37:11.360
We cannot let her main suspect.

02:37:11.360 --> 02:37:14.360
I will assemble an intervention team immediately.

02:37:14.360 --> 02:37:15.360
We'll start creating mobile.

02:37:15.360 --> 02:37:18.360
I'll form the intervention team that they should move in aggressively.

02:37:18.360 --> 02:37:20.360
As you find out, she might react violently.

02:37:20.360 --> 02:37:22.360
Since her PZ has gone offline,

02:37:22.360 --> 02:37:24.360
we should start at her home.

02:37:24.360 --> 02:37:25.360
Thankfully, we're already in our dress.

02:37:25.360 --> 02:37:27.360
Go through her communications.

02:37:27.360 --> 02:37:29.360
Maybe she will hint at places she's going that ain't home.

02:37:29.360 --> 02:37:31.360
Forward anything of importance to me.

02:37:31.360 --> 02:37:33.360
It's in your hands now.

02:37:33.360 --> 02:37:34.360
Don't mess this one up.

02:37:34.360 --> 02:37:36.360
We can't afford it after the last incident.

02:37:36.360 --> 02:37:37.360
Oh, come on.

02:37:37.360 --> 02:37:38.360
This guy's faking.

02:37:38.360 --> 02:37:39.360
Hello, is anyone there?

02:37:39.360 --> 02:37:40.360
Figures.

02:37:40.360 --> 02:37:43.360
Team Alpha Bravo Charlie, move, move, move.

02:37:43.360 --> 02:37:47.360
Oh, she's in call to her sister?

02:37:47.360 --> 02:37:49.360
Is she going to go to Juliet's?

02:37:49.360 --> 02:37:52.360
Welcome to Tech U.

02:37:52.360 --> 02:37:53.360
Oh, hey, Juliet.

02:37:53.360 --> 02:37:55.360
Thank God you're working right now.

02:37:55.360 --> 02:37:57.360
I called your mobile, but couldn't get hold of you.

02:37:57.360 --> 02:37:58.360
Can we talk?

02:37:58.360 --> 02:38:01.360
You know, I'm all alone here catching up on work.

02:38:01.360 --> 02:38:02.360
Is everything okay?

02:38:02.360 --> 02:38:04.360
Listen, I don't have much time.

02:38:04.360 --> 02:38:05.360
Okay.

02:38:05.360 --> 02:38:07.360
There is this psycho that's coming for me.

02:38:07.360 --> 02:38:08.360
He's been stalking me.

02:38:08.360 --> 02:38:09.360
Wait.

02:38:09.360 --> 02:38:12.360
She thinks the psycho's coming for her?

02:38:12.360 --> 02:38:13.360
I can't explain.

02:38:13.360 --> 02:38:14.360
Will you help me?

02:38:14.360 --> 02:38:15.360
Of course.

02:38:15.360 --> 02:38:16.360
But how?

02:38:16.360 --> 02:38:20.360
Do you know somewhere safe that my son and I can lay low for a while?

02:38:20.360 --> 02:38:22.360
Wait, she thinks the psycho's coming after us.

02:38:22.360 --> 02:38:23.360
Not us.

02:38:23.360 --> 02:38:25.360
Wait, but did Nina do it?

02:38:25.360 --> 02:38:26.360
I don't think Nina did it.

02:38:26.360 --> 02:38:27.360
Come on.

02:38:27.360 --> 02:38:28.360
You got to think.

02:38:28.360 --> 02:38:29.360
Okay.

02:38:29.360 --> 02:38:30.360
I think I know a place.

02:38:30.360 --> 02:38:31.360
It's in the middle of nowhere.

02:38:31.360 --> 02:38:32.360
She could be lying.

02:38:32.360 --> 02:38:33.360
No, wait.

02:38:33.360 --> 02:38:34.360
Don't say it.

02:38:34.360 --> 02:38:35.360
I think he might be listening.

02:38:35.360 --> 02:38:36.360
What?

02:38:36.360 --> 02:38:37.360
How?

02:38:37.360 --> 02:38:38.360
This guy is a hacker.

02:38:38.360 --> 02:38:43.360
He's already gone through my computer and I'm pretty sure he's listening to my call.

02:38:43.360 --> 02:38:44.360
She knows the call.

02:38:44.360 --> 02:38:45.360
So are you kidding me?

02:38:45.360 --> 02:38:47.360
I mean, like, listen right now.

02:38:47.360 --> 02:38:50.360
Just don't say anything that will give my location away.

02:38:50.360 --> 02:38:51.360
Okay.

02:38:51.360 --> 02:38:52.360
Better safe than sorry.

02:38:52.360 --> 02:38:54.360
Just help me get out of here.

02:38:54.360 --> 02:38:55.360
Bit late for that now.

02:38:55.360 --> 02:38:57.360
Now he knows where I work.

02:38:57.360 --> 02:38:58.360
Sorry.

02:38:58.360 --> 02:38:59.360
Okay.

02:38:59.360 --> 02:39:00.360
Let's just get out of here.

02:39:00.360 --> 02:39:01.360
Thank you.

02:39:01.360 --> 02:39:02.360
Give me a sec.

02:39:02.360 --> 02:39:05.360
Just going to pack some stuff.

02:39:05.360 --> 02:39:08.360
Did Nina know where she was?

02:39:08.360 --> 02:39:12.360
I'm bringing my gun.

02:39:12.360 --> 02:39:14.360
Squad team, I repeat.

02:39:14.360 --> 02:39:16.360
I repeat.

02:39:16.360 --> 02:39:17.360
Boogie is hot.

02:39:17.360 --> 02:39:18.360
She's armed.

02:39:18.360 --> 02:39:19.360
I didn't expect that.

02:39:19.360 --> 02:39:20.360
I'll tell the intervention team.

02:39:20.360 --> 02:39:21.360
Yeah.

02:39:21.360 --> 02:39:22.360
Boogie is hot.

02:39:22.360 --> 02:39:23.360
We're changing.

02:39:23.360 --> 02:39:24.360
Someone listening to this.

02:39:24.360 --> 02:39:25.360
Your arm.

02:39:25.360 --> 02:39:26.360
Yeah.

02:39:26.360 --> 02:39:28.360
And if I don't get protection, I'm going to be dead anyway.

02:39:28.360 --> 02:39:29.360
Someone's at the door.

02:39:29.360 --> 02:39:30.360
She's at the back door.

02:39:30.360 --> 02:39:31.360
Okay.

02:39:31.360 --> 02:39:32.360
Okay.

02:39:32.360 --> 02:39:33.360
Okay.

02:39:33.360 --> 02:39:34.360
Okay.

02:39:34.360 --> 02:39:35.360
She's at the back door.

02:39:35.360 --> 02:39:36.360
Come on, squadron.

02:39:36.360 --> 02:39:37.360
She went out of the back.

02:39:37.360 --> 02:39:38.360
She went out of the back.

02:39:38.360 --> 02:39:39.360
She's a flight.

02:39:39.360 --> 02:39:40.360
Maybe she'll climb out the window.

02:39:40.360 --> 02:39:41.360
Hold up.

02:39:41.360 --> 02:39:42.360
Is everything all right?

02:39:42.360 --> 02:39:43.360
Damn.

02:39:43.360 --> 02:39:44.360
Nina.

02:39:44.360 --> 02:39:45.360
No, no, no, no.

02:39:45.360 --> 02:39:46.360
He spotted me.

02:39:46.360 --> 02:39:47.360
Isn't that our task?

02:39:47.360 --> 02:39:49.360
He knew I was climbing out the window.

02:39:49.360 --> 02:39:50.360
How?

02:39:50.360 --> 02:39:51.360
Okay.

02:39:51.360 --> 02:39:52.360
Nina.

02:39:52.360 --> 02:39:55.360
What the heck are you doing?

02:39:55.360 --> 02:39:57.360
Not going down without a fight.

02:39:57.360 --> 02:39:58.360
That's what.

02:39:58.360 --> 02:39:59.360
Is she?

02:39:59.360 --> 02:40:00.360
What?

02:40:00.360 --> 02:40:01.360
Why are you fighting?

02:40:01.360 --> 02:40:02.360
Don't fight.

02:40:02.360 --> 02:40:04.360
Make sure you look more sus.

02:40:04.360 --> 02:40:06.360
You're not going to get.

02:40:06.360 --> 02:40:07.360

02:40:52.240 --> 02:41:09.520
you check the mail please who's right and who's right and what do you mean

02:41:09.520 --> 02:41:14.680
who's right and what's now

02:41:18.840 --> 02:41:23.760
Abraham Nina I'm truly sorry the investors but to be frank you overstepped

02:41:23.760 --> 02:41:27.200
the boundaries of the bombs were meant as a warning for those who are different

02:41:27.200 --> 02:41:34.560
oh she's perished a beacon they were not meant to kill oh my god I can't believe

02:41:34.560 --> 02:41:38.200
you just went to sit can you they work together but why I still don't get it

02:41:38.200 --> 02:41:42.760
this changes everything we must find Abraham tomorrow before we'll need the

02:41:42.760 --> 02:41:47.800
rest it's been one hell of a day they were not meant to kill I mean even if

02:41:47.800 --> 02:41:53.120
they were not meant to kill so fucking crap you joking me that women lost our

02:41:53.120 --> 02:42:00.040
life and it was you do you honestly believe that after all you've seen oh the

02:42:00.040 --> 02:42:05.360
bombs were meant as a warning they were not once again you disappoint me with

02:42:05.360 --> 02:42:15.400
your instrumentable hatred and rage consider our agreement boy what oh my

02:42:15.560 --> 02:42:28.840
gosh complete episode 3 that was insane he set her up actually

02:42:29.680 --> 02:42:35.720
oh my god episode 4 memory hole

02:42:37.720 --> 02:42:43.480
oh back again well yes my job and it clocking for my shift I still can't

02:42:43.480 --> 02:42:47.520
believe what happened we got the perpetrator the bomber everything looks

02:42:47.520 --> 02:42:52.800
that way but at what cost I mean did we do the right thing flag and miss as

02:42:52.800 --> 02:42:58.280
dangerous did we kill her in the end I wish you could talk to me at least this

02:42:58.280 --> 02:43:02.560
one time speaking into this one-way channel feels like barking at a wall

02:43:02.560 --> 02:43:09.920
endlessly worst of all as you found out Abraham seems to have incited and planned

02:43:09.920 --> 02:43:15.120
the assaults we need to get him today there must be some lead on him we have

02:43:15.120 --> 02:43:20.720
overlooked we'll keep observing all others in case we learn of something new

02:43:20.720 --> 02:43:29.440
okay let's see what the headlines are a legend perpetrator is dead

02:43:32.960 --> 02:43:37.120
listen I don't like the reports either we need to cover the fact that this

02:43:37.120 --> 02:43:41.400
happened somewhere else we cannot frighten people sometimes their truth

02:43:41.400 --> 02:43:51.160
and ours have to divert for the common good oh they're framing on her yeah

02:43:51.160 --> 02:43:58.880
Donald's weekend Harrison this is oh my god her sister just perished isn't this

02:43:58.880 --> 02:44:06.040
your office number I appreciate I'm once again important Harrison Nina is dead

02:44:06.080 --> 02:44:10.480
quit bullshit me not funny take a look at the TNV if you don't believe me my

02:44:10.480 --> 02:44:20.080
god what she's been associated with the bomb and I can't believe it Nina you

02:44:20.080 --> 02:44:25.920
stupid piece of what in the hell there's more I spoke to her yesterday she

02:44:25.920 --> 02:44:30.160
called me I've never heard her so scared she said she was being tracked by

02:44:30.160 --> 02:44:36.720
someone and needed to skip town sorry I need to hydrate she just wanted to let

02:44:36.720 --> 02:44:39.480
me know what was going on in case anything happened to her then packed a

02:44:39.480 --> 02:44:43.600
few things went on her way she did message me about someone tracking her

02:44:43.600 --> 02:44:47.920
as well though it was this hacker who screwed with her page what did she tell

02:44:47.920 --> 02:44:51.800
you she suspected someone to be wiretapping her calls she wasn't

02:44:51.800 --> 02:44:54.920
exactly willing to talk about it I don't know for sure but I think it could

02:44:54.920 --> 02:44:59.840
have been the police oh this is brilliant how long until they discover the

02:44:59.840 --> 02:45:04.480
connection to us they might be listening to this very call as we speak about

02:45:04.480 --> 02:45:09.880
Nina why would they we didn't do anything or did you know but it's

02:45:09.880 --> 02:45:13.640
becoming blatantly obvious those governments are trying to set us up the

02:45:13.640 --> 02:45:20.840
bombs were exactly where we held our protest then those letters with em

02:45:20.840 --> 02:45:27.880
believes the government wants to set it up that's the second time and now you

02:45:27.880 --> 02:45:31.280
tell me you've been in contact with Nina yesterday seems to be that they must be

02:45:31.280 --> 02:45:35.120
setting us up because we didn't do anything for sure I almost understand it

02:45:35.120 --> 02:45:41.960
almost the fourth wall speaking up against them too many times I don't know

02:45:41.960 --> 02:45:49.720
hmm we should seek help just in case help who's gonna help us Joseph Langley the

02:45:49.720 --> 02:45:55.720
lawyer yeah the boyfriend a lawyer what do you want him to do bus law

02:45:55.720 --> 02:46:00.960
enforcement the government he understands our situation Abe also knew Joseph I

02:46:00.960 --> 02:46:10.800
thought I didn't know that they knew each other hmm brah really Joe's they make the

02:46:10.800 --> 02:46:13.800
law they break the law they know each other very well this could be a new

02:46:13.800 --> 02:46:19.960
lead I will request Joseph yeah another person because we're so convinced we're

02:46:19.960 --> 02:46:25.280
doing the right thing huh we have cleared to proceed we are going to need to know

02:46:25.280 --> 02:46:30.840
some basics on who Joseph Langley is remember to check old sources other than

02:46:30.840 --> 02:46:36.400
that focus on hints of Abraham he's the center oh god I can't read that fast he

02:46:36.400 --> 02:46:41.440
understands it really they make the law so yeah take it you got a better plan we

02:46:41.480 --> 02:46:45.400
need to get people on our side turn things around Abraham knew that yeah

02:46:45.400 --> 02:46:49.080
you're right he did know that so now you've set on miraculously achieving

02:46:49.080 --> 02:46:52.840
something the thought spent one and a half years this is not about the thought

02:46:52.840 --> 02:46:58.040
this is about me defending myself well then what's your defense plan there is a

02:46:58.040 --> 02:47:04.640
guy a guy goes by the name initiate might actually be a girl who cares look

02:47:04.640 --> 02:47:09.440
the hack on this thought blog is very elaborate our site is super safe I'm not

02:47:09.440 --> 02:47:16.040
an amateur that guy girl whatever is skilled and initially mentioned having

02:47:16.040 --> 02:47:20.480
no sympathy for the government you're gonna trust a random hacker who targets

02:47:20.480 --> 02:47:24.880
thought simply because he said he doesn't like the government why would he

02:47:24.880 --> 02:47:29.160
first threaten us and they've worked with us just leave it to me Joe leave it

02:47:29.160 --> 02:47:35.040
to me all right tails there you come leave it to me I'll persuade initiate

02:47:35.040 --> 02:47:38.520
with ease imagine the possibilities with their own okay you know what have it

02:47:38.520 --> 02:47:43.680
your way I'll have it main arguing like the good old days it's your might be more

02:47:43.680 --> 02:47:47.440

02:48:17.600 --> 02:48:24.800
wish my way I miss my wife I love that thing I thought mr. Donald left thought

02:48:24.800 --> 02:48:32.560
now he seems like he's recruiting makes his exit seem unlikely so they put her

02:48:32.560 --> 02:48:38.760
up as the bomba when confronted by the special forces and you know drew a

02:48:38.760 --> 02:48:43.720
firearm fired the team returned to killing

02:48:45.040 --> 02:48:49.880
well there's our lawyer we can start collecting stuff on him Sandra you so

02:48:49.880 --> 02:48:59.240
by the way I'm going to see your contact in a very casual manner I like how

02:48:59.240 --> 02:49:08.880
they didn't break up either multiple homicide when prompted to surrender the

02:49:08.880 --> 02:49:12.480
suspect instead showed out aggressively while producing a firearm aiming at one

02:49:12.480 --> 02:49:17.640
of the agents the suspect then opened fire wounding several agents on the

02:49:17.640 --> 02:49:22.480
show oh wounding special agent on the shoulder and defense draws pistol and

02:49:22.480 --> 02:49:27.080
returned fire as the situation briefing had already suggested to proceed with

02:49:27.080 --> 02:49:31.560
caution the suspect was hit in the chest causing her to collapse an ambulance

02:49:31.560 --> 02:49:36.520
was called but paramedics cannot resuscitate due to injuries in

02:49:36.520 --> 02:49:43.760
kvatsa bowl with la ha ha always got a weak girlfriend

02:49:47.760 --> 02:49:51.520

02:50:42.600 --> 02:50:47.040
sure let's read the car article I do love and though love reading a bit of

02:50:47.040 --> 02:50:53.760
car okay there's a star there there's also star admissions still what did I

02:50:53.760 --> 02:51:01.960
miss there's literally nothing I missed here

02:51:01.960 --> 02:51:07.440
there's nothing I can click on the army page

02:51:08.400 --> 02:51:12.680
so must be something weird cuz it insists there's like a piece of

02:51:12.680 --> 02:51:15.680
information about Nina here but to be honest you can't have popped her clogs

02:51:15.680 --> 02:51:31.920
so it's kind of over before it started maybe it comes up we already we got our

02:51:31.920 --> 02:51:42.360
information that we needed it was all a dream and they woke up so if I close

02:51:42.360 --> 02:51:50.880
these will that only show me the ones that might have something I feel like

02:51:50.880 --> 02:51:56.520
okay yeah I was gonna say I feel like I've got like so many pages what's this

02:51:56.520 --> 02:52:06.080
oh oh it's you oh that's right everyone said that you were a student well

02:52:06.080 --> 02:52:12.480

02:52:12.480 --> 02:52:20.240
graduated right so there's a connection between them to go we're getting there

02:52:20.240 --> 02:52:25.520
allow me one yawn please right we'll just upload any information we find cuz

02:52:25.560 --> 02:52:30.800

02:52:30.800 --> 02:52:40.360

yarn and reciprocate to show that you're sympathetic towards me he partnered

02:52:59.960 --> 02:53:08.680
with Catherine De La Croix a fellow shouldn't sure sure you're got a joke

02:53:08.680 --> 02:53:15.640
on what did you standing there wow I didn't even know she had a locker you're

02:53:15.640 --> 02:53:20.560
going before she joined politics mr. Langley definitely has been around the

02:53:20.560 --> 02:53:26.760
block I'm still I'm still so far so good on mr. Langley excluding the

02:53:26.760 --> 02:53:30.440
connections to De La Croix everything's on the prison what we need to know right

02:53:30.440 --> 02:53:35.600
now are his connections to Abraham and possibly the other members your broad

02:53:35.600 --> 02:53:43.860
military service my Nina no I did I mean there's any combat experience look

02:53:43.860 --> 02:53:50.580

your mouth and you burp it back into mine you taste my chicken breath actually

02:54:05.860 --> 02:54:14.580
had steak last night my dad I heard from Cassandra I'm sorry I didn't get

02:54:14.580 --> 02:54:20.300
back to you really that's good where she in jail it's not good she got arrested

02:54:20.300 --> 02:54:28.540
what's why she's trying I didn't need this burp in dress waiting till I upload

02:54:28.540 --> 02:54:33.420
that I was informed Cassandra's been taken in because apparently they have new

02:54:33.420 --> 02:54:36.740
evidence regarding the attack on the officer I tried to call me Julie but

02:54:36.740 --> 02:54:40.900
they claim she didn't want to talk to me that's their official statement where did

02:54:40.900 --> 02:54:47.940
they suddenly dig up new evidence from you Juliet you're the problem I've

02:54:47.940 --> 02:54:54.380
uploaded an audio yes already on patreon it was like a like a milestone

02:54:54.380 --> 02:54:59.020
thank you and it's just me chugging colon water and burping use of the sadly

02:54:59.020 --> 02:55:03.140
aligns perfectly with another incident you probably read the TNB today you

02:55:03.140 --> 02:55:12.180
mean about the bomber yeah that woman that died Nina she was a friend she was

02:55:12.180 --> 02:55:15.820
a friend and all I was just guess that she was there and a member of the group

02:55:15.820 --> 02:55:22.740
called thought oh no I'm sorry I had no idea but reflands were women it's okay

02:55:22.740 --> 02:55:30.620
you pause you can have known your rate this is very troubling I'm not getting

02:55:30.620 --> 02:55:35.660
evil vibes from Yosef come to think about everyone asked me a favor and

02:55:35.660 --> 02:55:41.740
called Nina sometime ago I hope that wasn't nice might well be I doubt Abe knew

02:55:41.740 --> 02:55:47.340
about other folk name you know a favor for her this could be important follow

02:55:47.340 --> 02:55:54.460
that lead I was just a small thing nothing of importance oh oops I spoke to

02:55:54.460 --> 02:55:57.860
Harrison and remember the group we agreed the police might be investigating us

02:55:57.860 --> 02:56:02.180
next they might be onto everything and thought they might lock us up straight

02:56:02.180 --> 02:56:08.820
away I mean can they do that well even with the safety belt in place they

02:56:08.820 --> 02:56:14.060
still need solid indication that you're involved in the actual bomber although

02:56:14.060 --> 02:56:18.660
honestly I'm not sure what constitutes a solid indication these days is there

02:56:18.660 --> 02:56:25.820
anything we can do that you can do maybe I think it's all girl I'm gonna check the

02:56:25.820 --> 02:56:32.540
audio instruments really appreciate you come to me it really is wearing and I

02:56:32.540 --> 02:56:36.900
would take this on immediately wear it not for Cassie I made the mistake of set

02:56:36.900 --> 02:56:41.420
I hope Cassandra primarily concerned again Cassandra released I mean that's a

02:56:41.420 --> 02:56:46.940
new thing Yosef Nina's dead she got shot there's no time for next oh well oh

02:56:46.940 --> 02:56:53.140
well I thought it was oh well no it's oh well there's a pause okay I need time to

02:56:53.140 --> 02:56:56.460
read into some more specialized codes of law again write some emails see if

02:56:56.460 --> 02:57:00.580
there's a legal limbo or basically anything I can do for Cassandra maybe

02:57:00.580 --> 02:57:04.580

03:07:48.460 --> 03:07:53.260
it's not really much to go off of is it

03:07:53.340 --> 03:07:59.340
the plaintiff was granted inflicted by a medical condition

03:07:59.340 --> 03:08:05.820
huh well they'll get him over it the fish is worth the smoke

03:08:05.820 --> 03:08:09.180
this seems to spend a lot he felt too sick for work tried to get out was charged

03:08:09.180 --> 03:08:12.940
for it and instead was found guilty considering the fact the bombings are

03:08:12.940 --> 03:08:19.980
starting to look like a very weird vendetta high time we fined him

03:08:20.620 --> 03:08:26.220
what is going on oh we've got a medical right well we've got an address already

03:08:26.220 --> 03:08:30.220
what's the deal address well done I'll request a team to invent

03:08:30.220 --> 03:08:33.820
somehow I doubt he's around continue work on notify even the team gets back

03:08:33.820 --> 03:08:36.780
okay so this is a state of birth we're just going to fill in out the old

03:08:36.780 --> 03:08:41.020
profile right relationship uh apparently

03:08:41.020 --> 03:08:46.700
here's a tumor oh

03:08:46.700 --> 03:08:50.940
that's kind of sad

03:08:52.300 --> 03:08:56.300
there a point of putting that down I mean I guess just be easy on the man if

03:08:56.300 --> 03:09:02.380
you find them oh cancer yeah just if you do find

03:09:02.380 --> 03:09:06.460
them just go easy on them

03:09:07.100 --> 03:09:10.700
the average life expectancy

03:09:11.900 --> 03:09:15.740
okay so he doesn't expect to live long maybe he wants to make a change on his

03:09:15.740 --> 03:09:19.260
we owe this is harsh but does this mean it means he has

03:09:19.260 --> 03:09:27.100
nothing to lose yeah hmm I I concur why is this red

03:09:30.300 --> 03:09:33.100
salaries

03:09:33.580 --> 03:09:36.460
invoices

03:09:36.460 --> 03:09:39.900
invoice

03:09:39.900 --> 03:09:43.900
uh headlings why is headlings

03:09:50.860 --> 03:09:54.380
I assume something new will pop up if I like don't mess up the

03:09:54.380 --> 03:09:58.140
headlings but I keep messing it up so it's not working

03:09:58.140 --> 03:10:01.660
okay let's see what's going on here I'm unexpected proposal fine I'm

03:10:01.740 --> 03:10:05.100
not sure I refuse just refuse

03:10:05.580 --> 03:10:11.260
is he pro is he probably looking to break bad

03:10:12.860 --> 03:10:17.180
I don't know what the reaction is to that joke so I'll let you guys figure out

03:10:17.180 --> 03:10:24.140
goldfills refuse that first then take the contract only to breach it how

03:10:25.100 --> 03:10:32.300
I mean does it matter if he's you know

03:10:36.140 --> 03:10:39.500
what is the conflict

03:10:40.300 --> 03:10:46.700
I'm married I mean does it is he married no the other person that's 19 show the

03:10:46.700 --> 03:10:50.940
conflict and then this is 2005

03:10:51.340 --> 03:10:58.620
okay so this is the truth one on whoever on yosef this is the truth one on him

03:10:58.620 --> 03:11:02.380
because that thought was from ages ago

03:11:04.060 --> 03:11:08.380
I don't think we should mess with private life okay sorry sorry I was just

03:11:08.380 --> 03:11:12.220
getting I don't know I don't know what you want okay

03:11:12.380 --> 03:11:18.940
head headlines keeps being read

03:11:19.820 --> 03:11:25.580
right initiate is just a troll play again again again

03:11:27.500 --> 03:11:34.380
go fail what did I miss here that he was abroad that's so specific I mean

03:11:34.380 --> 03:11:38.700
put him in case that and pops up got a snip I gotta go soon I hope you

03:11:38.700 --> 03:11:43.100
read the rest of your shingles oh thank you for hanging please don't worry if you

03:11:43.100 --> 03:11:46.700
have to go at any point I'm gonna try and redirect into

03:11:46.700 --> 03:11:51.820
emi and I don't think I'm gonna finish up this

03:11:51.820 --> 03:11:56.060
chapter and then I'll redirect into emi's ASMR video so you're all forced to

03:11:56.060 --> 03:12:01.420
watch it and okay I'm very clearly messing this

03:12:01.420 --> 03:12:04.220
up I think

03:12:05.420 --> 03:12:09.660
I think I'm messing it up I'm not actually sure

03:12:09.660 --> 03:12:15.180
what it wants me to do other than to like smack in

03:12:16.140 --> 03:12:18.540
all right

03:12:18.700 --> 03:12:23.740
like warrior the web profile picture is obviously not a pug the birthday is

03:12:23.740 --> 03:12:30.220
obviously wrong he's not ancient the omnipresent interwebs no interest in

03:12:30.220 --> 03:12:35.660
interting like none of this is anything

03:12:35.660 --> 03:12:37.980
hmm

03:12:39.020 --> 03:12:44.300
so then what's in the gallery there's something else here

03:12:44.300 --> 03:12:47.740
club

03:12:47.740 --> 03:12:57.020
uh contact is responsibly 25 dollars you already said the last chapter

03:12:57.020 --> 03:13:01.260
probably look at the last article the gem one

03:13:02.460 --> 03:13:06.060
it's just this is

03:13:06.940 --> 03:13:14.540
really you must be kidding I do not do Russian

03:13:18.460 --> 03:13:25.580
what is going on is there like a listen conversation

03:13:25.580 --> 03:13:31.660
is it something I'm not sure whatever try and get Cassandra out

03:13:31.740 --> 03:13:35.820
no I didn't do anything if I'd be trying to get my girlfriend out too

03:13:35.820 --> 03:13:39.900
yeah careful now you're starting to sound a little sympathetic

03:13:39.900 --> 03:13:43.420
mister don't tell me you've changed your

03:13:43.420 --> 03:13:48.140
oh whoops there's something important in here

03:13:49.820 --> 03:13:54.220
uh no there's no

03:13:55.020 --> 03:14:01.020
that's the only thing that's not important

03:14:01.020 --> 03:14:04.780
wait is it the same night of the bomber

03:14:06.700 --> 03:14:10.940
I don't know why it was red right what have I not reported on in this

03:14:10.940 --> 03:14:16.060
conversation you're working sure

03:14:16.620 --> 03:14:20.300
I'm sure it's so important to write down that she's working

03:14:20.300 --> 03:14:24.700
I have truly so important call the fisherman

03:14:24.700 --> 03:14:28.860
cheer man wait sorry call the fishing clubs

03:14:28.860 --> 03:14:32.780
cheer man exactly right I've done all the listener stuff

03:14:32.780 --> 03:14:38.780
I've done all the insider stuff unless this is it which is really random if

03:14:38.780 --> 03:14:41.340
this is it

03:14:45.820 --> 03:14:49.180
I've been skipped school but they've been officially proved as a benefit I

03:14:49.180 --> 03:14:51.820
guess that's good

03:14:51.820 --> 03:14:58.140
is it okay you look some love and not full

03:15:00.860 --> 03:15:06.780
I already claimed it in the waiting

03:15:08.140 --> 03:15:16.700
ah whoever hmm system breviser he's cleared it

03:15:16.700 --> 03:15:26.060
pictures I've just checked mails let's just go to them again

03:15:26.060 --> 03:15:31.340
financially trouble doesn't change a thing

03:15:31.900 --> 03:15:35.660
okay sure he rejected a case

03:15:36.380 --> 03:15:39.500
I already submitted the wedding poll because he was getting roasted on that

03:15:39.500 --> 03:15:45.100
fishing website for it like I'm not even kidding

03:15:45.100 --> 03:15:47.580
he's married a conflict with another thing

03:15:47.580 --> 03:15:51.100
this guy was like being really rude but I already submitted

03:15:51.100 --> 03:15:57.820
but the game was like almost sexual no no one cares

03:15:57.820 --> 03:16:01.500
that's not got anything to do anything

03:16:01.500 --> 03:16:05.660
so feedback on your request

03:16:05.660 --> 03:16:09.020
I'm about to start shopping everything in the freaking

03:16:09.020 --> 03:16:14.060
thing right device offline I need to ask your favor

03:16:14.060 --> 03:16:17.820
okay sure let's do the favor stuff

03:16:19.260 --> 03:16:25.820
and the circle is complete well is it or

03:16:26.540 --> 03:16:30.620
isn't it he may have supported the bomb bar

03:16:30.620 --> 03:16:37.100
I don't know if that oh that was it oh crap hold on Harrison Harrison

03:16:37.340 --> 03:16:42.140
hi wise ass anyone there

03:16:45.340 --> 03:16:49.820
so you find your way here Harrison check his bank account and find out why he's

03:16:49.820 --> 03:16:52.540
broke oh I forgot about that because we never found

03:16:52.540 --> 03:16:55.900
digging through your timeline was a pain in the ass why didn't you just tell me

03:16:55.900 --> 03:16:59.340
you wanted to chat when you told me what happened to me now I went

03:16:59.340 --> 03:17:03.580
straight on to research I got the impression that the

03:17:03.580 --> 03:17:09.100
government is up to no good great work captain obvious

03:17:10.540 --> 03:17:14.940
I did find something something you won't like a bit

03:17:17.900 --> 03:17:24.780
or well oh no he knows he knows he knows he knows

03:17:27.820 --> 03:17:32.140
oh no we did everything to keep it outside of the nation

03:17:32.140 --> 03:17:35.340
and now it's unfortunate people have become aware of it ahead of its time

03:17:35.340 --> 03:17:40.860
we must tread very carefully we will not speak so openly any longer I fear

03:17:41.420 --> 03:17:44.860
seems it's a system that can put everything on the web under surveillance

03:17:44.860 --> 03:17:50.540
what do you mean everything in this every way maybe pcs whatever your bs in

03:17:50.540 --> 03:17:55.900
me I'm not man I'm not I wish I was

03:17:55.980 --> 03:17:59.660
title drop he said the game name

03:17:59.660 --> 03:18:02.860
that's the same for a secret how do you pull this off storage alone is one

03:18:02.860 --> 03:18:04.860
thing that I've been going through all of it

03:18:04.860 --> 03:18:09.020
the outsource surveillance to people outside the nation

03:18:09.020 --> 03:18:15.740
am I outside the nation oops those people are supposed to collect pieces of

03:18:15.740 --> 03:18:19.020
data from websites all kinds of communication whatnot and send it to

03:18:19.020 --> 03:18:22.540
Orwell it's safe to assume that nothing is safe anymore

03:18:22.540 --> 03:18:26.380
wait so can I not report properly how come you never heard of it even more

03:18:26.380 --> 03:18:29.820
importantly how come you have

03:18:30.380 --> 03:18:34.140
uh I have very good connections to some hackers outside

03:18:34.140 --> 03:18:40.380
the nation I don't know if I can report that or not

03:18:40.380 --> 03:18:47.820
the new thing or two about secret I mean it's information

03:18:49.500 --> 03:18:53.420
that spins what happened to Nina a real hacker now unfortunately we can't go

03:18:53.420 --> 03:18:59.420
after people outside the nation so we don't even have the right to do it

03:18:59.420 --> 03:19:03.100
do they have no decency no respect Harrison don't

03:19:03.100 --> 03:19:07.420
yeah this is everything we fought again you need to watch your tongue

03:19:07.420 --> 03:19:12.860
oh is there about to say something I don't need to watch my tongue

03:19:12.860 --> 03:19:17.500
it's already being what please chill out or we will regret it

03:19:18.460 --> 03:19:22.460
oh I'll never chill again unless this madness stops

03:19:22.460 --> 03:19:26.860
I already got an idea Taylor made for you

03:19:28.220 --> 03:19:31.660
man if you discuss things like this here you'll get us both locked up

03:19:31.660 --> 03:19:34.700
let's meet somewhere then

03:19:35.500 --> 03:19:38.380
yeah and say the word and they'll be there in two

03:19:38.380 --> 03:19:41.340
oh they'll be there too

03:19:41.820 --> 03:19:47.820
there must be something we can just talk without the possibility someone

03:19:47.820 --> 03:19:51.500
snooping around we can't stand and do nothing

03:19:51.500 --> 03:19:56.380
there's one thing it's a bit risky

03:19:58.860 --> 03:20:02.540
are you using my chat till right now is this week well if I want to live in

03:20:02.540 --> 03:20:05.980
life in a cage I go down in no so the system needs yeah

03:20:05.980 --> 03:20:11.020
it's abominable but yeah um this tool has a bill inside for

03:20:11.020 --> 03:20:14.460
oh we're not going to be able to see it

03:20:15.740 --> 03:20:19.420
it's a custom encryption algorithm written by me easy to break but off

03:20:19.420 --> 03:20:23.180
record and that's what we need they'll probably

03:20:23.180 --> 03:20:26.780
kind of break this not right way give us a couple of messages probably what are

03:20:26.780 --> 03:20:31.980
you waiting for go for it is it gonna work

03:20:33.660 --> 03:20:37.900
I'll activate it now just remember to write quickly

03:20:38.380 --> 03:20:44.300
and keep your fingers crossed it'll work oh it works

03:20:52.060 --> 03:20:56.220
I'm getting reports of unknown don't worry Orwell should be able to break the

03:20:56.220 --> 03:20:59.740
encryption in mere second

03:21:00.060 --> 03:21:04.140
I mean is it

03:21:08.860 --> 03:21:13.820
I'm going to meet you in the coffee shop at three you wink wink

03:21:13.820 --> 03:21:20.140
and before it's html encryption it could work oh it's already broke

03:21:20.140 --> 03:21:23.660
I will need some time to localize the intro and then I'll only have second one

03:21:23.660 --> 03:21:28.780
thing what will you do with what I find there

03:21:31.340 --> 03:21:37.740
start a war on the government

03:21:38.860 --> 03:21:43.900
is he actually going to do that or is the old gas no break

03:21:44.460 --> 03:21:47.980
is the old breaks no gas

03:21:51.100 --> 03:21:55.180
oh well okay fine oh shit they actually mean it okay uh

03:21:55.180 --> 03:21:57.980
time to get to work yeah we're gonna have to report that one chief and we'll

03:21:57.980 --> 03:22:01.580
be honest if he wants a war well he shall have one we will

03:22:01.580 --> 03:22:05.980
have mr odono rested long before I can obtain that

03:22:05.980 --> 03:22:09.580
the national beholder just published oh best see for yourself

03:22:09.580 --> 03:22:11.900
what

03:22:17.340 --> 03:22:21.900
how are they aware of the thought we never report I imagine you're looking

03:22:21.900 --> 03:22:24.780
my way now aren't you I have absolutely no idea who leaked this info

03:22:24.780 --> 03:22:29.580
certainly not me only very few people can access the date on our back end this

03:22:29.580 --> 03:22:36.140
doesn't exactly a dozen investigation quite the office that we need to hurry

03:22:40.220 --> 03:22:43.420
freedom is unfree

03:22:43.420 --> 03:22:47.260
oh no

03:22:52.700 --> 03:22:59.820

oh naughty man naughty naughty naughty naughty

03:23:09.660 --> 03:23:12.700
these look poles I've had enough of them

03:23:12.780 --> 03:23:16.380
deliberately hard to get them to quietly when they're at the center of a

03:23:16.380 --> 03:23:18.780
right haha so there may be something in connection between

03:23:18.780 --> 03:23:22.380
Yosef and Nina after all if you can find one last

03:23:22.380 --> 03:23:26.700
indication that this may be meant for Nina

03:23:26.700 --> 03:23:32.300
be enough to get custody

03:23:34.380 --> 03:23:39.500
and say there what's going on here feedback on your request

03:23:39.500 --> 03:23:43.340
there then there's this reoccurring donation that's been going on I can

03:23:43.340 --> 03:23:47.900
respect if you want to help out a friend or something

03:23:47.900 --> 03:23:51.580
but we need a reply

03:23:52.780 --> 03:23:58.140
the certificates issued outstanding ongoing

03:24:00.380 --> 03:24:06.060
so tax evasion are helping out a pal what one is that

03:24:06.780 --> 03:24:10.860
excuse me for sending like these are major issues to see apart from the

03:24:10.860 --> 03:24:13.340
number of clients drop on steadily your expense

03:24:13.340 --> 03:24:17.740
since the end when especially the credit card went up by a whopping

03:24:17.740 --> 03:24:20.860
any idea the reason but you stopped at some point seriously

03:24:20.860 --> 03:24:24.780
if all those expenses are a must well I would definitely agree with laying off

03:24:24.780 --> 03:24:29.180
the person that's what I'm thinking it's a

03:24:29.180 --> 03:24:34.380
not a real charity no there's no way he's sending money

03:24:34.380 --> 03:24:43.100
to his pals not the certificate he's embezzling money

03:24:44.700 --> 03:24:51.180
oh that's what the payments are for yes oh no

03:24:52.700 --> 03:24:57.900
oops I thought it was going to be obvious it's embezzlement

03:24:57.900 --> 03:25:01.900
wait isn't it embezzlement

03:25:02.860 --> 03:25:08.220
your entanglement about the immediate termination of work regarding

03:25:08.220 --> 03:25:13.020
ah he got laid off you mentioned you've been participating in suspicious groups

03:25:13.020 --> 03:25:17.980
and activities that's funny I think I'll submit that the wrong way around

03:25:17.980 --> 03:25:23.580
we picked the wrong one sorry I submitted the wrong way around I'm sorry

03:25:23.580 --> 03:25:28.860
I'm too slow IQ okay hey hey hey seems the government just fired the

03:25:28.940 --> 03:25:32.540
fresh shots our way seems so

03:25:32.540 --> 03:25:35.340
I thought they might take longer to trace all back to thought I didn't expect

03:25:35.340 --> 03:25:37.980
that it'd be openly right about it

03:25:37.980 --> 03:25:40.460
hmm

03:25:41.020 --> 03:25:45.900
they fired me hee hee I'm not surprised

03:25:45.900 --> 03:25:49.100

just as I thought it couldn't get any worse yeah but

03:26:04.140 --> 03:26:08.620
it was about new evidence in the officer's injury

03:26:08.620 --> 03:26:13.420
not the bomb the look like the eucliness is heading her way

03:26:13.420 --> 03:26:17.020
think the police will follow this lead to of course it's just a matter of case

03:26:17.020 --> 03:26:19.740

I think it's gonna be our dealio I have no idea what was supposed to be for me

03:28:23.740 --> 03:28:29.180
maybe the veal or collab actually where we get to look at pretty girl sorry I

03:28:29.180 --> 03:28:31.900
just had to look at the news yes it's actually a bit weird a pretty harsh yes

03:28:31.900 --> 03:28:36.300
but I made an interesting discovery that I need to talk to your

03:28:36.300 --> 03:28:39.500
colleague Harrison yes I was just chatting I set up a conference colleague

03:28:39.660 --> 03:28:43.260
that would be great a lot of reading give me a moment

03:28:43.260 --> 03:28:47.020
honestly I was like oh let's play this game wait a minute I need to read

03:28:47.020 --> 03:28:49.740
oh lord

03:28:49.740 --> 03:28:53.420
you're gonna be one more time starting at something get and put in that ep

mouth of yours I am is that a promise

03:29:01.900 --> 03:29:06.380
oh and then we're gonna go back to this one

03:29:06.860 --> 03:29:10.460
got a face that we're known wait it's like huh you take me what Nina mentioned

03:29:10.460 --> 03:29:13.820
the cops are wiretapping her calls why not chat I think the call is much more

03:29:13.820 --> 03:29:17.900
appropriate for legal councils raises less arbors and chats might be logged

03:29:17.900 --> 03:29:22.060
we're just the average couple seeking advice right couple we need to do this

03:29:22.060 --> 03:29:24.620
don't speak too openly don't mention wiretaps okay

03:29:24.620 --> 03:29:30.300
I'm like this alright right group call

03:29:31.340 --> 03:29:34.540
she's not tired anymore she's something else

03:29:34.540 --> 03:29:39.500
hey Yosef seems like this is working hello I'm Harrison I presume yes and

03:29:39.500 --> 03:29:46.300
you're the law guy he's a good girl let's meet

03:29:46.300 --> 03:29:49.900
I just read about your group I guess this isn't exactly brightening things up

03:29:49.900 --> 03:29:53.580
for you you could say that the rules here has big

03:29:53.580 --> 03:29:56.860
faith in your skills Yosef here to elaborate on what you

03:29:56.860 --> 03:30:01.180
found out yes okay so you all know the safety

03:30:01.660 --> 03:30:08.860
yes yeah all in all it's an aggregation of paragraphs to get people

03:30:08.860 --> 03:30:14.060
behind bars is much more easily and prior in lives as necessary

03:30:14.060 --> 03:30:17.180
no they use it as a sorry excuse for spying on people all the time

03:30:17.180 --> 03:30:21.020
intimidating them yes I understand what's particularly dangerous about it for

03:30:21.020 --> 03:30:24.620
you is that individuals might be prosecuted by mere indication of

03:30:24.620 --> 03:30:28.140
threats to the nation in specific situations it will be

03:30:28.140 --> 03:30:31.900
more than enough to point at a word you said in a rage to consider

03:30:31.900 --> 03:30:35.100
you dangerous that's enough to hold you in for some time

03:30:35.100 --> 03:30:39.020
but what's even more problematic for you is the so-called

03:30:39.020 --> 03:30:44.940
a transivity of indication the what you all form a group an activist group this

03:30:44.940 --> 03:30:47.740
links you to one another now if there was sufficient

03:30:47.740 --> 03:30:51.580
indication that say Abraham created thought to commit crimes

03:30:51.580 --> 03:30:54.860
or even acts of terrorism well they have grounds to arrest you all

03:30:54.860 --> 03:30:58.780
but we didn't do anything how is this just this is so

03:30:58.780 --> 03:31:02.220
freaking outrageous they'll twist and turn their so-called evidence until they

03:31:02.220 --> 03:31:06.940
get what they need you will need to be very very careful from no one

03:31:06.940 --> 03:31:11.260
we can do something about this right we need explicit evidence showing

03:31:11.260 --> 03:31:15.420
Abraham created this group to be peaceful prove it beyond any doubt

03:31:15.420 --> 03:31:18.700
this is why I need to ask you about Abraham to find out his original

03:31:18.700 --> 03:31:22.220
intentions well ask away the two of us were friends for a

03:31:22.220 --> 03:31:26.220
while but I never got the feeling he told me a lot about what was going on in

03:31:26.220 --> 03:31:30.940
his life he was reclusive indeed that's what he was like

03:31:30.940 --> 03:31:35.980
except when he was around thought how was thought formed he found out about me

03:31:35.980 --> 03:31:40.140
by discovering my blog said he wanted to start a debate club

03:31:40.140 --> 03:31:43.420
I said fine we had a couple of lame meetings nothing much happened

03:31:43.420 --> 03:31:46.700
a debate club then that would be good that could

03:31:46.700 --> 03:31:52.380
hardly be regarded as a terrorist asset uh yes but Abe was obsessed with getting

03:31:52.380 --> 03:31:57.660
his message out make people aware what the government was doing

03:31:57.660 --> 03:32:03.740
right that's kind of a given right anti-government and you go

03:32:03.740 --> 03:32:11.100
then we went with so it was Nina why and we know why and we know why don't we

03:32:11.100 --> 03:32:15.340
he wanted to get out of the contract of illness but the government said no

03:32:15.420 --> 03:32:20.540
so as we said Nina oh god stop stop telling me everything Jesus

03:32:20.540 --> 03:32:26.300
right Nina thought of the protest so it was miss

03:32:26.300 --> 03:32:30.860
November the mall yeah during the studies I met Abraham online by chance

03:32:30.860 --> 03:32:34.460
he motivated me to take his course

03:32:34.460 --> 03:32:40.300
hold on more vigilio right then jules took over with the planning for the two

03:32:40.300 --> 03:32:48.140
protests okay you false intention the bad planning causes you

03:32:48.140 --> 03:32:53.020
Nina me each and every one of us is guilty of deviating from the intention

03:32:53.020 --> 03:32:56.380
jules you don't know what you're talking about it was Nina she neglected

03:32:56.380 --> 03:32:59.980
Nina was pretty violent I'm gonna be honest like I kind of feel like Nina was

03:32:59.980 --> 03:33:05.020
the violent one cause I think it was that one

03:33:05.100 --> 03:33:09.420
sorry but Nina literally reached for a

03:33:09.420 --> 03:33:13.260
a pew pew I'm not sure if I'm willing to believe this is really contradictory

03:33:13.260 --> 03:33:17.500
to what Abraham wanted if so wait didn't he not bomb him on purpose

03:33:17.500 --> 03:33:21.260
no he said they went too far if so why are we doing the same

03:33:21.260 --> 03:33:24.140
okay he's gone we don't know where and we don't know how to reach him

03:33:24.140 --> 03:33:27.420
sadly oh well I will need to get back to writing some emails

03:33:27.420 --> 03:33:29.980
of course I understand jesus I'll get back to you I suppose it was going to

03:33:29.980 --> 03:33:33.580
benefit you too well because Sandra is removed from custody yes goodbye

03:33:33.660 --> 03:33:38.220
yes thanks don't mention it and use your quit well the lawyer wasn't too helpful

03:33:38.220 --> 03:33:41.100

03:33:41.100 --> 03:33:45.020
nice I suggest we meet somewhere in town

03:33:46.300 --> 03:33:49.980

03:33:52.220 --> 03:33:58.300
oh and jules the old meeting place on jules what the band location

03:33:58.300 --> 03:34:02.460
must be the band location something important to them shame they didn't say

03:34:02.460 --> 03:34:06.540
but resting item is out of the question we don't have enough evidence

03:34:06.540 --> 03:34:12.140
right give me the band because that's clearly a band thing where's the band

03:34:12.140 --> 03:34:19.580
the targets I know for a fact it'll be one of the locations here

03:34:21.020 --> 03:34:28.780
yikes come on it has to be a location here I don't believe it otherwise

03:34:28.780 --> 03:34:33.180
give us an address don't be shy okay maybe be a little bit shy hold on I'm

03:34:33.180 --> 03:34:37.340
being dumb I'm going the wrong way freedom is unfree

03:34:37.340 --> 03:34:40.860
your thoughts are free

03:34:43.100 --> 03:34:48.700
oh there's like tons of more comments I hope you guys get what you deserve

03:34:48.700 --> 03:34:53.820
we want you out mfers

03:34:53.980 --> 03:35:00.060
ooh the location they used to hook up at his trailer

03:35:02.620 --> 03:35:06.620
oh my god this is giving me like nothing right he said he was gonna send more

03:35:06.620 --> 03:35:09.500
emails right

03:35:10.220 --> 03:35:14.780
is there more emails nope

03:35:14.860 --> 03:35:20.140
what if you put it in the bin for me to look at why yes of course make it super

03:35:20.140 --> 03:35:24.940
easy for me african to say there's one thing here

03:35:24.940 --> 03:35:29.500
I'll just shove it in because it's cluttering it says I can interact with

03:35:29.500 --> 03:35:32.140
it go

03:35:32.220 --> 03:35:34.940
okay we don't really care but it's that we better go

03:35:34.940 --> 03:35:40.060
so strange financial troubles and large donations don't go hand in hand

03:35:41.020 --> 03:35:47.740
right what did I miss in the dialogue

03:35:47.740 --> 03:35:53.820
he got fired that's not really a big deal is it is it might oh maybe it is

03:35:53.820 --> 03:35:58.620
because I literally have no other leads whatsoever

03:35:58.620 --> 03:36:05.020
um I literally have no other lead I'm gonna just start spamming stuff in

03:36:05.020 --> 03:36:10.620

must be between them way back down here

03:36:40.220 --> 03:36:43.900
yeah no idea okay all of us are looking at each other right now

03:36:43.900 --> 03:36:47.900
and a room of me and refling all of us are looking at each other for an answer

03:36:47.900 --> 03:36:51.660
right why does this keep saying it's blue

03:36:51.660 --> 03:36:55.420
whatever is blue I'm ignoring it because we keep saying I can interact with

03:36:55.420 --> 03:36:58.620
something when I can't

03:37:03.820 --> 03:37:09.820

03:37:14.860 --> 03:37:17.340
how

03:37:18.940 --> 03:37:22.140

but since we know that uh plan Nina planned the first

03:37:43.820 --> 03:37:47.180

03:37:50.780 --> 03:37:54.780

03:39:19.420 --> 03:39:24.780
intrude our database info6 said they had averted the attack

03:39:24.780 --> 03:39:31.740
huh I'm not sure how much I believe that the attack was

03:39:31.740 --> 03:39:37.820

if you can call him that he openly spoke out against the government

03:40:06.540 --> 03:40:11.740

you on the other hand have been mediocre so far you could not save them all but you could

03:54:02.220 --> 03:54:07.420
you at least got the prime suspect you will do better i will be your new advisor in this case

03:54:08.460 --> 03:54:14.860
this has become far too important to leave the case with to an advisor with an exposed identity

03:54:14.860 --> 03:54:19.900
same as well but no longer fit to work on orwell moving forward we will not speak about him again

anti orwell protesters gather at the freedom memorial oh no wait a minute are we taking

03:55:38.300 --> 03:55:43.660
down the surveillance i might have accidentally exposed him but i'm kind of getting what i want

03:55:43.660 --> 03:55:50.860
negotiations renewed really i don't think anyone cares about you're bluffing

03:55:51.580 --> 03:55:57.660
yeah members of thought my dear friends as you've all experienced today we're already besieged

03:55:57.660 --> 03:56:02.700
by the government they have denounced us called us terrorists and turned the public against us

03:56:02.700 --> 03:56:06.780
this will stop their day is about to come to an end i have a plan but for this to work we must

03:56:06.780 --> 03:56:12.700
meet like we did the old ways when we had our meetings and cafe chestnut oh no that's actually in

03:56:12.700 --> 03:56:19.980
the book the chestnut cafes in the book we will have a conference called 4 p.m because i'm well aware

03:56:19.980 --> 03:56:24.940
the meeting in person won't work you will you need not fear surveillance always been taken

03:56:24.940 --> 03:56:36.300
careful care of how am i supposed to report that or do i want them to like i kind of want them to

03:56:36.300 --> 03:56:45.900
survive though um kind of want them to i mean this is the only lead i have so sure you didn't

03:56:46.140 --> 03:56:51.820
just showed him what had been exposed and that was important a gathering we know abraham

03:56:51.820 --> 03:56:56.060
is passed away someone must be imperative this is clearest crystal we must act swiftly and

03:56:56.060 --> 03:57:03.260
collect as much evidence as possible for gathering commences this is certainly no good as you know

03:57:03.260 --> 03:57:10.060
processing data chunks and it's time i would say we have rough time for roughly 20

03:57:10.220 --> 03:57:14.220
oh no

03:57:21.020 --> 03:57:25.900
okay you must think i'm sure first you don't want to tell me we've won wait up i want to take them down

03:57:30.300 --> 03:57:33.500
i want to take them down though wait had to hold on

03:57:33.500 --> 03:57:41.500
i had to take them down they'll not need to like

03:57:47.420 --> 03:57:49.500

03:58:07.740 --> 03:58:10.540
i want to take them down like i'm that's who i'm talking to

03:58:11.580 --> 03:58:16.140

03:58:16.860 --> 03:58:25.340

03:58:27.100 --> 03:58:32.380
they said don't fear the upload though so doesn't even matter what i do related document found

03:58:32.380 --> 03:58:35.580
this is where harrison did his thought we're probably thinking we won't be able to track him

03:58:35.580 --> 03:58:40.300
down we will track him down i've gone through the information we have on the remaining suspects

03:58:40.300 --> 03:58:45.820
regarding the impersonation of abraham we have received information from a reliable source that

03:58:45.820 --> 03:58:52.060
odonal is probably the leader of thought odonal predicted the bomb but this alone makes him suss

03:58:52.060 --> 03:58:56.780
we have no idea why odonal hid the post on the thought blog on his timeline we are yet to

03:58:56.780 --> 03:59:03.340
clarify why odonal would frequent a bomb a drugstore often perhaps for the materials

03:59:04.060 --> 03:59:08.940
why would odonal have two health insurances it's apparent that harrison odonal might as well

03:59:08.940 --> 03:59:13.340
i don't think it's him he is probably the one impersonating him i want you to prove this and

03:59:13.340 --> 03:59:19.500
lock him away for good i don't think it's him i can be honest with you chief lobby

more than 2048 computing citizens

04:16:09.820 --> 04:16:13.820
it's

04:16:14.220 --> 04:16:17.980
lobby high scores

04:16:20.620 --> 04:16:35.820
one of these is an ip address oh well that number is clearly something but i've not found what it is

04:16:35.900 --> 04:16:42.460
let's have one comment about ghost and like and it's useless it must be something on the computer

04:16:42.460 --> 04:16:47.820
or a check it says the picture of his mum is that why he's taken down big pharma

04:16:49.980 --> 04:16:53.660
right okay that was a waste but it's okay contacts who

04:16:54.060 --> 04:16:55.660
do

04:16:58.860 --> 04:17:01.660
update the number to jules

04:17:03.980 --> 04:17:06.540
check cassie's stuff now that her machine is alive

04:17:09.580 --> 04:17:12.300
i don't have it oh i don't have a cassie's machine

04:17:12.780 --> 04:17:16.620
huh

04:17:18.860 --> 04:17:21.180
how would i obtain it that number i can

04:17:21.820 --> 04:17:26.780
scoop her phone from contacts give me give me cassie's phone

04:17:29.180 --> 04:17:30.780
then i can go through her phone right

04:17:30.780 --> 04:17:36.780
yeah

04:17:39.740 --> 04:17:46.380
i already had access to her phone whips i don't have her like the id number of the phone though

04:17:47.980 --> 04:17:51.900
what a confusing game oh my goodness i don't like popego

04:17:52.700 --> 04:17:59.660
i mean i'm not sure that's gonna prove anything about

04:18:01.740 --> 04:18:03.900
a band is it back on the band

04:18:06.140 --> 04:18:13.100
we're putting the band back together bad ending um i'm getting the bad end i'm

04:18:13.100 --> 04:18:16.620
getting the failed ending where i had nothing because i don't know what we've been

04:18:16.620 --> 04:18:20.380
10 top blood cat pictures just for the last few honestly i might

04:18:25.660 --> 04:18:27.900
this get in touch the tank commander

04:18:30.780 --> 04:18:34.060
on that website that shows the owner

04:18:36.540 --> 04:18:38.060
because it had that lady on it

04:18:38.780 --> 04:18:44.700
not our family the other one it was like

04:18:47.740 --> 04:18:56.220
people her she's in it you you this you it's something to do with her it has to be

04:18:57.740 --> 04:19:01.260
but literally nothing is getting like highly either opened or

04:19:01.580 --> 04:19:10.140
anything i'm just getting roll let's say i can old like add old numbers i've submitted the location

04:19:13.580 --> 04:19:19.500
i've already submitted so i don't i think i just submit any old pitch now you know that

04:19:21.420 --> 04:19:27.260
oh no he's not oh sorry mommy i'm no coming home tonight sorry oh that's okay bad one

04:19:27.980 --> 04:19:34.300
i'm coming home she's actually a government official yeah okay well we've got two more

04:19:34.300 --> 04:19:38.220
let's just submit whatever it does not matter at this point i don't know what i'm doing

04:19:39.180 --> 04:19:42.940
and maybe it'll make more sense to make if we have like another attempt

04:19:46.300 --> 04:19:50.620
but right now my brain it's almost 4 p.m almost like to have one more time for an upload make

04:19:50.620 --> 04:20:00.140
sure it counts oh i'll make sure an upload counts all right um how about we do

04:20:03.100 --> 04:20:04.300
is there even anything

04:20:07.020 --> 04:20:10.940
there's not one thing okay it must be in this pc that can submit or

04:20:11.980 --> 04:20:16.460
there let's do this most useless piece of information like a puzzle get you and me

04:20:16.460 --> 04:20:19.180
we're done yeah very important

04:20:22.620 --> 04:20:25.500
i am not particularly interested in the love life of a terrorist

04:20:26.380 --> 04:20:30.540
it's 4 p.m i'm getting intervention teams ready to check all the locations

04:20:30.540 --> 04:20:34.140
now to wait to see what happens uh what's going on

04:20:36.380 --> 04:20:37.900
we they hacked them

04:20:38.860 --> 04:20:45.500
oh no what happens if they delete the whole system oh no

04:20:47.900 --> 04:20:50.060
i love sniffing the thoughts are free

04:20:52.060 --> 04:20:59.340
oh yay pokechan it's the pug let's go puggy wuggy

04:21:00.940 --> 04:21:03.260
hi mrsly you lurking in the shadows

04:21:03.340 --> 04:21:06.380
oh we've got a group call going

04:21:09.100 --> 04:21:12.300
hello is this working anybody here well i am

04:21:13.020 --> 04:21:15.500
harry i didn't know if you would still be around

04:21:16.700 --> 04:21:22.380
barely got here in time cassie you've been released yeah thanks to jossie i don't know

04:21:22.380 --> 04:21:28.540
what magic trick he pulled off but it worked jossie this is great i am not quite sure what

04:21:28.540 --> 04:21:36.940
i'm doing here but i am here as well joseph great oh joseph joseph great you're there holy crap

04:21:39.660 --> 04:21:47.660
what is this who are you a fool who is baffled by the madness he just witnessed otherwise initiate

04:21:48.380 --> 04:21:53.340
well i'm glad you decided to join us that's completely unintended what do you mean you're

04:21:53.340 --> 04:22:01.100
in the call aren't you yeah i'm also in orwell in orwell aib sent me an ip address to get into

04:22:01.100 --> 04:22:07.980
orwell it makes hacking the damn thing incredibly easy you did what and that worked like a charm

04:22:07.980 --> 04:22:13.740
i now kind of control the damn thing it's really really worrying come again you have orwell on a

04:22:13.740 --> 04:22:19.020
freaking leash great how does that worry you my control is limited and the government will get

04:22:19.020 --> 04:22:24.540
the control back at some point but this isn't my primary concern what makes me nervous is why

04:22:24.540 --> 04:22:30.140
would abraham have such extensive knowledge of orwell this whole thing reeks of an enormous trap

04:22:31.340 --> 04:22:36.700
abled betray us no he wouldn't but you're right something very strange as a foot we should get

04:22:36.700 --> 04:22:42.540
out right now and this is the point where it gets even worse i had a quick look at his file

04:22:43.420 --> 04:22:50.540
you would not believe what it says he's dead abraham is dead yeah he died quite some time ago

04:22:51.100 --> 04:22:56.620
what that's impossible i thought that when we he first disappeared but i put it to the back

04:22:56.620 --> 04:23:05.020
of my mind what became of him dead no abraham how he was very sick answer oh so that was real

04:23:05.020 --> 04:23:10.700
oh you old fool we couldn't tell us he gave nina the orders for the bomba after his demise

04:23:11.180 --> 04:23:18.060
this means this means someone has been setting her up real bad and not only

04:23:19.500 --> 04:23:26.540
her all of us who the f would do such a thing i'm not getting info on who or why

04:23:27.420 --> 04:23:36.620
what a pity but it does prove my point wait what do you mean jules it was me i set you up what

04:23:37.500 --> 04:23:43.500
jules you wait a sec i can't believe where this is going are you for real right now are you

04:23:43.500 --> 04:23:49.420
are you telling me you told nina to place those bombas i did i'm not proud of it but i had to be

04:23:49.420 --> 04:23:55.180
it had to be done what the heck why you and nina youtube ruined everything for abraham

04:23:55.180 --> 04:24:01.420
and for thought so you decided that leaving me wasn't enough for revenge you had to bomb innocent

04:24:01.420 --> 04:24:07.340
people and blame it on thought it was necessary only when things are at their darkest will people

04:24:07.340 --> 04:24:13.900
listen take note and actually enact change he knew that i know it was extreme extreme extremist

04:24:13.900 --> 04:24:23.820
murder i know believe me i know you are the reason i was in custody how could you do that to me

04:24:24.860 --> 04:24:28.700
thought needed to be destroyed that was the whole point instead of seeking me out and

04:24:29.420 --> 04:24:34.700
labelled you all target persons and investigated you all screwed up your lives people need to see

04:24:34.700 --> 04:24:40.380
how messed up orwell is it's not protection it's invasive and manipulation doom for everyone

04:24:40.380 --> 04:24:45.660
note if no one is innocent everyone is a suspect abe wanted to make the world stand up against

04:24:45.660 --> 04:24:50.860
orwell he knew how dangerous project word that's why he worked on it he did what he worked on it

04:24:51.580 --> 04:24:56.460
this confirms what i feared but i didn't want to believe it if so he could have gone to the

04:24:56.780 --> 04:25:01.740
media and taken it all public couldn't he he was afraid he thought nothing would ever change

04:25:01.740 --> 04:25:10.220
if he did can you blame him he told me everything and told only me damn oh funny i just realized

04:25:10.220 --> 04:25:14.380
you're actually much better yet much worse activists than nina or me could have ever been

04:25:14.380 --> 04:25:21.580
that's admirable in a strange mess up way you're nothing but a biatch julia a killer a liar

04:25:21.660 --> 04:25:27.580
cassie i oh just shut up shut up just shut up shut up this is madness julia first cassie then

04:25:27.580 --> 04:25:33.340
you pulled me into this all those people who suffered at your hand i still don't get it why draw

04:25:33.340 --> 04:25:38.300
all of this attention on thought you didn't convince anyone by your actions why this

04:25:38.300 --> 04:25:43.500
gathering why let me hack orwell i needed to convince just one person have faulty orwell is

04:25:44.140 --> 04:25:49.660
cause again the guy harry leaked information about was the man on the inside only an advisor

04:25:49.660 --> 04:25:54.060
the person who was really been spying on you still around the person who actually went through

04:25:54.060 --> 04:25:59.420
your stuff passed on the day of the one listening right now the investigator that's me that's right

04:25:59.420 --> 04:26:03.580
i'm talking to you i knew you had to be around where everyone would come together you had to

04:26:03.580 --> 04:26:08.700
be listening initiate was just a win for a chance to make sure you'd not immediately go up against

04:26:08.700 --> 04:26:14.220
those investigator i have a question for you now that you saw orwell firsthand do you really think

04:26:14.220 --> 04:26:19.100
that the system will help anyone do you think the government would not spy on you as well

04:26:19.100 --> 04:26:24.460
did you think you were outside the system think again they evaluate even you even you

04:26:24.460 --> 04:26:30.620
that he saw the madness they observe even you the investigators but we can stop it you can

04:26:30.620 --> 04:26:36.700
remember you became recruited for being outside of the system outside the nation what if we show

04:26:36.700 --> 04:26:42.620
people what they store about you that even you are not outside this as we're about to get docs

04:26:42.620 --> 04:26:46.860
because it's one of those meta games that show your ip address all you need to do investigators

04:26:46.860 --> 04:26:52.220
upload the data they have on you incriminating yourself this is so mind-bogglingly stupid

04:26:52.220 --> 04:26:56.620
jewels why would the investigator the government will come after that's exactly the point the

04:26:56.620 --> 04:27:02.620
evaluation is supposed to be a safety net so that no one misuses orwell active acting on

04:27:02.620 --> 04:27:08.620
evidence is mandatory if the investigator criminates himself they'll be forced to prosecute them and

04:27:08.620 --> 04:27:14.220
reveal this evidence that the investigators are actually being spied on this is absolutely mad i

04:27:14.220 --> 04:27:20.380
do not see this working i would love to offer an alternative investigator it just so happens that

04:27:20.380 --> 04:27:25.740
a certain catherine dilla qua is in these files too i say we make use of the fact we have control

04:27:25.740 --> 04:27:31.420
on over orwell let's use as a weapon and turn it against the government there's all there's

04:27:31.420 --> 04:27:36.780
something dirty to be found about her for sure let's act on that now we're talking no hurting won't

04:27:36.780 --> 04:27:42.220
help much she's just gonna get replaced this isn't the right way like i said jules just shut it nobody's

04:27:42.220 --> 04:27:47.420
interested in what you have to say but how can we trust this investigation what what the heck

04:27:48.540 --> 04:27:57.740
how did they find harrison what's going on oh no seems he just fell prey to the surveillance

04:27:57.740 --> 04:28:05.900
system oh shit we need to act fast i ratted him him out let me all show you what i can see right

04:28:05.900 --> 04:28:15.660
now here streams up here's kassandra's file well this feels like a slap in my face they have been

04:28:15.660 --> 04:28:22.380
collecting all of this they got me flagged potentially dangerous it was this investigator oh

04:28:22.380 --> 04:28:27.980
don't be mad hen no i can't trust that person i'm out use of your turn my turn

04:28:27.980 --> 04:28:37.100
hmm oh no what's funny about your file it says here you were offered a release of kassandra

04:28:37.100 --> 04:28:43.660
for info on thought and you agreed especially given the fact what just happened to harrison

04:28:44.300 --> 04:28:49.580
damn yes i did i got the offer and i reported harrison i had to kassandra would not have been

04:28:49.580 --> 04:28:57.580
released otherwise oh it's all falling apart i can't believe this this is horrible but then again

04:28:57.580 --> 04:29:04.860
you did it for me i don't know what to think merde kass i'm sorry for harry i can't take this

04:29:04.860 --> 04:29:12.780
anymore leave me out of all of this oh she's gone kassie wait you've got to do this without me i'm

04:29:12.780 --> 04:29:20.380
sorry user quit well this is just great see how we've messed up all this is is exactly what we

04:29:20.380 --> 04:29:26.380
need to show the people show them how we've been affected get them to fight with us i shall speak

04:29:26.380 --> 04:29:34.940
on behalf of nina then nina's popped her clogs i only realize now i might have been my fault nina

04:29:34.940 --> 04:29:40.300
got investigated in the first place oops but it's all clear the investigator is responsible for hunting

04:29:40.300 --> 04:29:45.260
her down like this look it was i didn't they chased her to death oh they caused her death no doubt

04:29:45.260 --> 04:29:49.900
perhaps investigator didn't know any better and we know nina was gilly it does not strengthen my

04:29:49.900 --> 04:29:56.860
trust though but then the investigator arrested harrison no no we cannot trust such a person

04:29:56.860 --> 04:30:03.500
meaning the final verdict is oh is he out not a single vote to trust the investigator oh

04:30:03.500 --> 04:30:10.380
i'm getting sniped are we finally gonna do this my way it's down to the two of us it seems well

04:30:10.380 --> 04:30:15.740
my plan to gather support for you failed investigator but if you still want to fulfill my plan go on

04:30:15.740 --> 04:30:21.180
and give delacrox hell you will find something dirty investigators time to make up your mind

04:30:21.180 --> 04:30:27.340
you can tear down the entire system just complete my plan please i will turn delacrox into a target

04:30:27.340 --> 04:30:33.180
person i think i can easily activate access to a pc for you as well what

04:30:35.260 --> 04:30:41.340
hoisin it's hacramen when abraham stopped his work for rosentech and the government he cloned

04:30:41.500 --> 04:30:46.060
all information he had and hid it in the office he told me and i maintained that the system is

04:30:46.060 --> 04:30:50.700
programmed to boot itself again in a couple of minutes you'll have access to everything you just

04:30:50.700 --> 04:30:55.820
need to find the uid of the device i cannot tell you here now that orwell isn't tracking data

04:30:55.820 --> 04:31:02.700
junk i feel understanding if you judge and incriminate me for what i've done i think i deserve it

04:31:02.700 --> 04:31:08.860
it's up to you now investigator do the right thing right how do we destroy it finally i thought the

04:31:08.860 --> 04:31:15.420
disturbance would never end the back end engineer said we've had an unwanted guess we already know

04:31:15.420 --> 04:31:20.460
it was thought it's about time we undo them we must be strong we must show these people for what

04:31:20.460 --> 04:31:24.780
they are the nation's safety depends on it finally waiting to incriminate them together as group all

04:31:24.780 --> 04:31:29.980
we need is a hint that abraham intended this group to carry out acts we could trace the attacks back

04:31:29.980 --> 04:31:33.660
to a remote pc it will now manually unlock the pc for you

04:31:38.940 --> 04:31:41.100

demurge i command you to no longer dig around abraham's path i could easily turn you into

04:42:34.780 --> 04:42:41.820
a target person for disobeying me you would not want that would you what what is strange though

04:42:41.820 --> 04:42:48.060
is that parenting requested material in this demurge it doesn't matter focus on undoing thought

04:42:48.060 --> 04:42:59.740
as a whole uh i abraham developed this codex for a project named demurge which has been renamed

04:42:59.740 --> 04:43:10.780
orwell and i have proof of everything we've got his pc oh so now you know it yes i hired him for

04:43:10.780 --> 04:43:15.260
orwell this is his doing it was me who wanted him on the project in the first place to get

04:43:15.260 --> 04:43:22.780
things right with orwell to follow ethical standards only very few people knew here knew that and i wanted

04:43:22.780 --> 04:43:29.100
to make sure it stayed that way our most ferocious enemy worked for us a person i choose now you

04:43:29.100 --> 04:43:34.460
know all discovered by the very tool it was all about the irony is not lost on me but while you

something in place in the event okay i'm doing it rating trustworthy

04:46:27.260 --> 04:46:30.700

04:54:41.820 --> 04:54:47.500
wrong with the what's wrong with my hat come on if it's perfectly just imagine it was transparent

04:54:47.500 --> 04:54:53.740
okay if it was transparent it's fine and then it gets a little tilted on the axis okay

04:54:54.540 --> 04:54:59.260
when did that reefling get there he's always been you've always been tinfoil hatin with me

04:54:59.260 --> 04:55:04.780

04:55:04.780 --> 04:55:10.380
been away for ages and then emmy can redirect into sheepsters because sheepsters has been doing

04:55:10.380 --> 04:55:15.900
endurance Elden Ring she's been doing fantastic on it honestly it will get a transparent yeah

04:55:15.900 --> 04:55:20.140
yeah next time transport your newton right let me just let me just refresh marshmallow in case

04:55:20.140 --> 04:55:30.060
there's anything that needs my immediate um uh let's just go ahead try and burp in my mouth

04:55:30.860 --> 04:55:32.540
i'm gonna ram my meat down your throat

04:55:34.700 --> 04:55:40.540
didn't didn't think it was going that way gonna be honest can't read the rest of that out loud

04:55:40.540 --> 04:55:46.700
that was not where i thought that was going to go i thought that was a meme and i read it with

04:55:46.700 --> 04:55:50.300
full confidence that was a meme um

04:55:54.700 --> 04:55:58.460
nice journey it's curious of just issues with uwu market because i ordered a hoodie last month

04:55:58.460 --> 04:56:02.780
and still haven't got i was unsure if i should ask you or call them uh uwu market handle other

04:56:02.780 --> 04:56:07.660
thing but they make things custom order they don't waste like it's not like they do a big batch of

04:56:07.660 --> 04:56:13.580
something um they make it like custom order so it does take a bit longer check your email

04:56:13.580 --> 04:56:17.740
that you got from them now again i'm not uwu market i don't deal with any of the merch that's

04:56:17.740 --> 04:56:22.380
kind of the the best part about uwu market is that we don't have to touch anything but they do

04:56:22.380 --> 04:56:26.380
make everything custom order like i ordered my keychains i'm still waiting for them to come

04:56:26.380 --> 04:56:31.820
but it's because they make it to order they don't make batches does that make sense the stream got

04:56:31.820 --> 04:56:36.940

05:01:40.140 --> 05:01:43.580
mentioned reading books about human nature and really enjoying them there's this game called

05:01:43.580 --> 05:01:51.340
near otomathia and it's very strange sometimes it has an interesting perspective on humanity it's

05:01:51.340 --> 05:01:56.380
an action game but some of the stories told might tickle your pickle it takes around 20 hours to

05:01:56.380 --> 05:02:00.860
complete so is that two endurance rooms you're asking for back to back don't mind if i don't

05:02:02.060 --> 05:02:08.300
i kill is also easy access night night no do i please no my name's bannish for looker or snooping

05:02:09.260 --> 05:02:16.620
i kill a gray sweats black compression shirt and a nicotine patch on the forehead gray sweatpants

05:02:16.620 --> 05:02:24.780
so she can see who goes to the back door near pks near is extremely long near tickles near

05:02:24.780 --> 05:02:30.780
definitely tickles there you totally know her for the content is her name like to be i think

05:02:30.780 --> 05:02:37.580
to be or not to be near it's four endings and needs like four placers no no i can't do that

05:02:37.580 --> 05:02:45.740
i'm no cut out for that okay um probably dumb question but does the meta tag basically mean

05:02:45.740 --> 05:02:55.020
that in the audio you the narrator are strongy meta tag means yes i'm strongy in that moment and

05:02:55.020 --> 05:03:01.500
you're reefing in that moment meta means like so you know when i'm like oh the asmr booth or something

05:03:01.500 --> 05:03:07.100
like that or like it's related to me being like a streamer towards you or that kind of meta behind

05:03:07.660 --> 05:03:14.140
does that make sense hopefully that makes sense um she does have a really nice dumpy though

05:03:14.140 --> 05:03:19.500
four main endings and 22 troll ones wait no there's no like fake i was wearing the tinfoil

05:03:19.500 --> 05:03:26.220
hat skews thing over thanks i didn't edit it myself reeflings did it i just i just yanked it yanked

05:03:26.220 --> 05:03:32.300
me now your tinfoil hat tell in his it's terrible sorry i'll just look in this direction even though

05:03:32.300 --> 05:03:37.420
i can't see chat at all in this direction i'm just gonna i'm just gonna look oh i can look at you

05:03:37.420 --> 05:03:43.500
at the corner of my eye hi there's an ending for each letter in the alphabet is that a joke

05:03:44.060 --> 05:03:49.900
or is that real okay i'm looking at you from the corner of my eye to make the hats sit properly

05:03:49.900 --> 05:03:56.140
okay all right reefing ah meta equals strongy strongy not character so you know how like i can be

05:03:56.140 --> 05:04:05.740
like oh a giantess just absolutely swallows you whole like that's roughly but if it's meta it's me

05:04:06.620 --> 05:04:12.780
you know does that make sense a girl love it's real but they're really joke endings and

05:04:12.780 --> 05:04:16.940
anything between them right away okay okay you literally you're giving us a side item

05:04:17.900 --> 05:04:24.540
