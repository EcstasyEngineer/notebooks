4268460	4273260	set of tea maybe hello
4277340	4285420	hello he doesn't he really looking at us like can i help you uh yeah actually you're a mission
4285420	4293340	objective we're not doing we're not going to be promised i'm just i'm just crouching around in
4293340	4299260	your garden i ain't doing nothing what we're doing we're watched through the fence he can't see us
4299260	4308700	but we can see him perfect we're we're such we're such bad geese literally what is going on
4308700	4316860	night wait why is he so what's the word he's so suspicious yeah he's paranoid he like can't even
4316940	4327100	enjoy his tea come on oh oh oh okay rub in the yeah okay okay go go go go go go
4329020	4334860	no you're supposed to spell it my good sir did i not give you a freighter in that
4335980	4346620	right take a sip hey hey wait that wasn't what we wanted wait nothing marked we wanted him to spit
4346620	4349180	out the tea so he has to drink the whole thing i think
4355420	4363980	no steal his shoes don't have to tell me to it hi oh no i didn't mean to do that i meant steal
4363980	4371580	your loafers sir yeah i'm sorry them loafers go sit down sir go sit down i want your shoes
4371820	4382300	oh he didn't like that i like him he's totally like he's tolerating us but he's came to not
4384940	4387340	uh what no
4390220	4394300	oh no i missed my turn there can't get it no can you
4394860	4403420	yeah out of bounds that's that's right you aren't coded to come over here only i'm coded to come
4403420	4410380	over here but you know oh did he just boot me because i took us through you don't deserve it
4413500	4420060	maybe use the big bell behind him oh that makes perfect sense actually to do the bell when he goes
4420060	4426060	for a sip can we see him do a sip from that side one of us has to go on the other side i think
4427100	4435340	i think we uh i think we both have to do it or else we can um hello i'm at a kakaya hello
4438300	4445020	excuse me madame i need the bell i shoot madame i need the access to the bell you're in my way
4445100	4452220	madame madame please refrain from getting in my way right oh sorry okay that's definitely what
4452220	4459100	you're supposed to do when he sips his tea we just need to hang around while he does his wee tea
4461980	4467580	okay we're getting there we just need our handheld through the game just a tiny bit okay just a
4467580	4471980	tiny bit of hand holding right so we need to wait until the suspiciousness is come back
4472220	4478460	he should he should drink his tea after he's done his like suspicious animation
4483260	4489340	oh wait i'm trapped i'm trapped we're good i didn't this game is a lot harder than i thought i thought
4489340	4495900	this was like a i say this about every game i play oh i thought this was a child's game why is it hard
4496940	4500060	and i don't know if that's just a reflection on me but he's still
4501020	4504380	no the bell thing needs to be set up again she's not fixing it
4505660	4512860	oh no you're right oh sugar what is she trying to fix right now oh well okay um she's currently
4512860	4521580	painting take the bow i didn't know i can take her paint and brush oh i can draw her paint and
4521580	4528380	brush one or the other good night starting about wake up in four hours bro you're gonna be charred
4530860	4537420	um no was that supposed to take the paint brush oh she's gonna fix the bell okay
4539660	4544700	and then do you want to put the duck in the other garden i wonder if that's what it is
4545260	4549100	you put the statue in the other garden so then she forgets she even had a duck
4551260	4559980	no i must tell you okay there we go okay it's now out of bounds so she can't ask for the duck
4559980	4570860	anymore it doesn't work like that and now we wait for him to drink his dang tea that must be frozen
4570860	4581180	solid at this stage because there's no way please ask for tea are you coming in this garden
4582620	4585420	your audio might be cutting it for me on discord a little bit
4586380	4592620	oh sorry no that was all good the knee buddy so she knows it's fake right
4595340	4597820	she tells you to move does that need to paint you
4600860	4605900	so she's fixing that wait can i put the bow on you now because we got rid of the statue
4606620	4618300	no i've done you didn't give me time right go paint right go paint geez let's do this bell for
4618300	4625180	this poor man oh he's about to do his animation okay no he was supposed to do the drink tea
4625180	4630540	animation why maybe this will help your mindset for the puzzle the game is meant a single player
4630540	4636780	everything can be done solo you mean we could be doing this twice as fast but taking us three

5604980	5607700	little tongue twister like when you say like
5608740	5613300	10 soldier or something and then you're supposed to say it like 10 times faster 10 soldier

5919700	5921700	Yes, we should join a circus
5924340	5928700	Okay, maybe geese girl considered for gen two because I adorable okay
5929340	5931340	Yeah, I'm starting to warm up to anyone
5932580	5939660	Suggestion to a wasp girl a what oh see bug girls are an issue and I'll tell you why actually development
5939700	5941700	I don't mind telling you this
5941700	5947700	Really because of like arachnophobia, for example or insect phobia is a very real thing
5947700	5950900	It is it has a possibility of putting the girl at a disadvantage
5952020	5959580	Design one. Oh damn. Yeah, and if you didn't know I don't mind sharing this with you. Um, but you know, how you
5959580	5961580	Have
5971540	5978700	That's it no more do you know oh my god, give him the flower you you were amazing. Oh, I can't give him the flower
5978700	5980700	He doesn't like it
5983620	5985620	You want to play again
5985820	5989580	Mr. No, he just wants to look at us. That's fine. Um, oh
5991300	5993860	So, you know how you have two eyeballs
5995500	6000460	Yeah, do you want to know I made sure you had two eyeballs because
6001140	6008580	It's actually really startling if a vtuber only has one eye or there's like a mono eye like monster girl type thing
6008900	6012220	and it's kind of one of the rules of like
6012740	6017420	Development is you can't wait. Can she see me under the table and
6018100	6022380	You must have a girl with like two eyes that isn't too freaky or you're putting them at a severe disadvantage
6022900	6027860	And like it kind of goes the same for vtubers that might have multiple eye designs
6028700	6030700	like it's
6031460	6033460	Unfortunately, just like a weird
6034820	6038100	What is going on over here are we doing the dishes? Oh
6038100	6040100	Oh
6041460	6050540	It's the toilet under table under table. Oh, no, there's no table over here. Leave us alone. Leave me alone. I'm scared
6054940	6059660	Hold on I want this knife. Hold on. Let me go on. Oh, wow. She's like chasing me all the way out
6059660	6062140	No, I'm chasing me onto the table. Good luck with that

6068980	6070480	Oh
6070480	6073860	The knife is underneath you. I think what am I to do with the knife?
6074700	6080180	I don't know. I felt like maybe we can destroy the dartboard with the knife break to the dartboard get the toy boat
6080180	6082180	Make the old man fall on his bottom
6083460	6088740	Steal a paint glass and drop it in a canal and set the table knife work plate. Oh
6089780	6094460	Set what table? Oh, I'm like I'm like proper stuck. Oh, what's this?

6099380	6101660	Where are we supposed to set up a table? Oh
6103940	6109180	There's like a little underway pathway here, I mean a bug girl doesn't multiple need multiple eyes
6111140	6114800	It's it's kind of hard to like oh my god, I'm like, sorry
6114800	6118060	Mercy's currently fighting with the cafe owner and I'm like under here like

6150740	6154420	Yeah, he's literally already says all my back hurts
6155260	6157260	How do we break a dart board?
