0	2160	Want to start your own VTuber Agency?
2160	3040	Don't!
3040	8400	But if you insist, then here's stuff I wish I knew beforehand or was realistic about before
8400	9600	starting operations.
10320	15920	1. Make sure before you start ordering artworks or assets that you have fully fleshed out
15920	20160	reference sheets of your VTubers or else you will constantly be going back and forth with
20160	25120	artists for fixes. That's time and money wasted when it could have been done right the first time.
25120	27440	2. Make sure you have the money to burn.
27440	31600	Whatever cost you estimated in your head, double it then add some more.
31600	34480	Vealor's original budget was $30,000 USD.
35040	38880	The reality, double it and add some more.
38880	42480	3. Do not expect unrealistic things from your talents.
42480	46000	You have to enable your talents so helping with clipping, video ideas,
46000	49040	submitting ideas means your talents can achieve their dreams.
49040	52960	And most of all, check what your talents internet speeds are.
52960	55120	Most likely someone is still on dial up.
55120	56800	Hmm.
