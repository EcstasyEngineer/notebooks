WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:05.040
You wanted a fero-kusou gaki, I gave you a ferrokusou dente.

00:05.040 --> 00:10.300
You wanted a doten hag, I gave you a doten hag.

00:10.300 --> 00:15.260
You wanted a dorky yandere, I gave you a dorky yandere!

00:15.300 --> 00:20.340
You wanted a masochistic brocon, I gave you a masochistic drozon.

00:20.340 --> 00:23.980
You wanted a mild dominatrix, I gave you a mild dominatrix.

00:23.980 --> 00:33.980
And now I bring you the VTuber that no one asked for, a goddamn hypnotic cuttlefish.

00:33.980 --> 00:55.980
Did I kick or did I f***ing kick, ladies and gentlemen?

00:55.980 --> 00:59.980
I hope you enjoyed your evening so far.

00:59.980 --> 01:02.980
Let me formally introduce myself.

01:02.980 --> 01:06.980
Ladies and gentlemen, I'm Strony Cuttle.

01:06.980 --> 01:09.980
The surname is because I'm a cuttlefish.

01:09.980 --> 01:16.980
And Strony because I am the daughter of the gamer Strontium, my dad's gamer tag.

01:16.980 --> 01:19.980
And I wouldn't be here without him, you know, because he came from his b***h sack.

01:19.980 --> 01:21.980
Anyway, age, age, ladies and gentlemen.

01:21.980 --> 01:27.980
Oh, yet again, I have failed the VTuber challenge of tell us your age.

01:27.980 --> 01:31.980
Cuttlefish normally live to a year, so time's ticking.

01:31.980 --> 01:37.980
Anyway, my birthday is October 10th, which is actually National Sweden Cuttlefish Day.

01:37.980 --> 01:40.980
They're both step-for-the-pod, so I don't mind sharing that birthday.

01:40.980 --> 01:48.980
My height is 162 centimetres, which makes me 5'3", because I forgot to update this hi-ho over here now.

01:48.980 --> 01:51.980
For my languages, turns out, if you're born in Scotland,

01:51.980 --> 01:55.980
the British government recognises Scottish slang as its own language,

01:55.980 --> 01:58.980
so in your face, I can speak two languages.

01:58.980 --> 02:01.980
Grace, I am a cuttlefish, and I'm also good at the 100-metre sprint.

02:01.980 --> 02:03.980
Thank you, thank you, I'll be here all week.

02:03.980 --> 02:06.980
My likes and dislikes.

02:06.980 --> 02:10.980
ASMR, if you like ASMR, you're going to get spoiled, rotten on my channel.

02:10.980 --> 02:13.980
Or any of the VLOR girls' channels.

02:13.980 --> 02:15.980
Shows your plasters.

02:15.980 --> 02:18.980
Oh God, can you see it? Wait, you're not supposed to see that part!

02:18.980 --> 02:23.980
I like seeing victory on my screen because I could use any tiddly wink of serotonin.

02:23.980 --> 02:26.980
And I also like plasters and band-aids.

02:27.980 --> 02:29.980
I wonder why.

02:29.980 --> 02:31.980
For no nefarious reason.

02:31.980 --> 02:33.980
For my dislikes.

02:33.980 --> 02:35.980
I don't like bullies in video games.

02:35.980 --> 02:38.980
Your teammates aren't all going to magically be MLG pros, so relax.

02:38.980 --> 02:41.980
I don't like serious people, I don't like seriousness.

02:41.980 --> 02:43.980
I think my gen mates can all pray for a bunch of bouts.

02:43.980 --> 02:45.980
I can't be serious, it's terrible.

02:45.980 --> 02:48.980
I'm the most unprofessional person they've probably ever worked with in their entire life.

02:48.980 --> 02:49.980
My hi-ho.

02:49.980 --> 02:53.980
And I don't like mongolian throat singing, I'm so sorry.

02:53.980 --> 02:57.980
People seem to really like it, but I don't.

02:57.980 --> 02:58.980
It doesn't sound nice.

02:58.980 --> 03:02.980
Apologize to the one mongolian throat singer that's watching right now.

03:02.980 --> 03:04.980
Huggy, I'm nice and generic.

03:04.980 --> 03:07.980
Sorry, there's nothing interesting about my taste.

03:07.980 --> 03:08.980
Movies, Lord of the Rings.

03:08.980 --> 03:09.980
Definitely come.

03:09.980 --> 03:12.980
Animes, nice and generic again.

03:12.980 --> 03:14.980
Books, I actually started reading books this year.

03:14.980 --> 03:18.980
I know this sounds crazy as a sentence because people read books in general.

03:18.980 --> 03:20.980
Me, however, I started this year.

03:20.980 --> 03:26.980
I really like dystopian books that talk about human nature and how humans are stinky poo poo heads.

03:26.980 --> 03:32.980
For my music, Hatsunomiku and Atarashigako, I want to see them live if it's possible.

03:32.980 --> 03:35.980
Oh, yeah, just a wee bit of a gamer.

03:35.980 --> 03:36.980
It doesn't mean I'm good at games.

03:36.980 --> 03:38.980
Now before there's that one person that's like,

03:38.980 --> 03:41.980
eh, you've played all these games, that means you're an MLG pro.

03:41.980 --> 03:43.980
No, relax, relax.

03:43.980 --> 03:45.980
I've played games full stop.

03:45.980 --> 03:50.980
Okay, these are the games that I remember playing or just kind of like have a good,

03:50.980 --> 03:52.980
yeah, play them type thing, okay.

03:52.980 --> 03:56.980
See who's been an Xbox gamer to apologize for my goals.

03:56.980 --> 04:00.980
I want to get monetized on YouTube, so feel free to subscribe

04:00.980 --> 04:03.980
because we have been called like crazy since then.

04:03.980 --> 04:09.980
I want to stream so much that you can basically read everything in my voice.

04:09.980 --> 04:14.980
You know, you'll be Scots yourself and you can apply for citizenship and all that good stuff.

04:14.980 --> 04:18.980
I also want to create a Mega A Smart collab with my gen mates,

04:18.980 --> 04:20.980
which I've already got quite a few on the way.

04:20.980 --> 04:22.980
So don't worry, it's coming.

04:22.980 --> 04:23.980
You just got to wait.

04:23.980 --> 04:27.980
I have a childhood dream actually of 100,000 gamer score

04:27.980 --> 04:30.980
and it's actually possible now with Xbox Game Pass.

04:30.980 --> 04:35.980
I would absolutely love to explore a heken amount of childhood games

04:35.980 --> 04:38.980
and I would love to play like your childhood games as well.

04:38.980 --> 04:40.980
There's a little fun factoid about me.

04:40.980 --> 04:43.980
I'm a wee bit of a workaholic.

04:43.980 --> 04:48.980
So I would like to say that for every 1,000 subscribers I get on my YouTube channel,

04:48.980 --> 04:51.980
I'm going to upload a celebratory.

04:51.980 --> 04:52.980
Really hard to say that if you're Scottish.

04:52.980 --> 04:55.980
ASMR video pair 1,000 subscribers.

04:55.980 --> 05:00.980
I've already got like tons ready to go, so don't be shy.

05:00.980 --> 05:02.980
You know what to do, wink, wink.

05:02.980 --> 05:05.980
I also want to challenge myself.

05:05.980 --> 05:06.980
I want to collab.

05:06.980 --> 05:10.980
I want to make ASMR collabs with over 100 different v-tubers

05:10.980 --> 05:13.980
and I'm actually so much of a workaholic.

05:13.980 --> 05:19.980
I already have three confirmed with v-tubers outside of VLR, so I'm very serious about that.

05:19.980 --> 05:22.980
If you ever have a 3DO, you're a v-tuber, I'm coming to find you in your DMs.

05:22.980 --> 05:25.980
I would love if we could read Lord of the Rings together.

05:25.980 --> 05:27.980
I think it would be so fun.

05:27.980 --> 05:31.980
I'm not a very strong reader, but I think it would be really cute to do like a little

05:31.980 --> 05:35.980
before the end of stream, read one chapter or something like that.

05:35.980 --> 05:39.980
And last but certainly not least, I would love to get stream sniped.

05:39.980 --> 05:41.980
I absolutely adore it.

05:41.980 --> 05:44.980
I love playing multiplayer games where you can join me.

05:44.980 --> 05:47.980
You can have an amazing time and have so much fun.

05:47.980 --> 05:49.980
It's just one of my favorite things, okay?

05:49.980 --> 05:50.980
So please do not be shy.

05:50.980 --> 05:51.980
These are my goals.

05:51.980 --> 05:52.980
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

05:52.980 --> 05:53.980
I'm dumb.

05:53.980 --> 05:54.980
Okay, I'm really dumb.

05:54.980 --> 05:56.980
I don't know how to come up with tags.

05:56.980 --> 05:57.980
I'm not funny.

05:57.980 --> 05:58.980
I'm not good with puns.

05:58.980 --> 06:02.980
So I am more than happy to take any suggestions.

06:02.980 --> 06:06.980
My ushi marks are squid, but I'm a cuttlefish.

06:06.980 --> 06:10.980
And then the second emoji kind of looks like a man bowing.

06:10.980 --> 06:11.980
Hmm?

06:11.980 --> 06:12.980
Hmm?

06:12.980 --> 06:16.980
Maybe that is a hint to what I might try to make content-wise.

06:16.980 --> 06:20.980
And for fan names, there is only going to be one option.

06:20.980 --> 06:21.980
Come on.

06:21.980 --> 06:23.980
Let's not beat around the bush.

06:23.980 --> 06:26.980
You are my refling.

06:26.980 --> 06:28.980
You will always be my refling.

06:28.980 --> 06:30.980
And thank you so much for waiting.

06:30.980 --> 06:32.980
I have bloody missed you.

06:32.980 --> 06:36.980
Special shout out to Nari and Squishy Goal.

06:36.980 --> 06:40.980
You may have noticed a bit of a trending pattern.

06:40.980 --> 06:46.980
Squishy Goal that conceptualized us all and now I helped out and made us come to life,

06:46.980 --> 06:47.980
which is beautiful, beautiful.

06:47.980 --> 06:52.980
So thank you everyone who came together to make this fantastic gen of indulge.

06:52.980 --> 06:54.980
Oh, okay, okay, okay, okay.

06:54.980 --> 06:59.980
Most people get to do, oh, this is my gen mate's impression.

06:59.980 --> 07:00.980
Me.

07:00.980 --> 07:01.980
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

07:01.980 --> 07:04.980
I picked my gen mates.

07:04.980 --> 07:05.980
Do you understand?

07:05.980 --> 07:07.980
I picked them, okay?

07:07.980 --> 07:09.980
Now I'm going to tell you why I picked them.

07:09.980 --> 07:11.980
Mercy's determination.

07:11.980 --> 07:14.980
She was going to make it no matter what.

07:14.980 --> 07:18.980
The definition of mercy in the dictionary, if you look up, it just says determined, okay?

07:18.980 --> 07:21.980
There was no way in heck she was not going to get in.

07:21.980 --> 07:23.980
That's all I'm going to say on that one.

07:23.980 --> 07:25.980
Emi.

07:25.980 --> 07:32.980
Emi said to someone who's being rude to her to keep themselves safe and Minecraft

07:32.980 --> 07:35.980
and then she instantly got the part, okay?

07:35.980 --> 07:42.980
I say, I say, oh, I say has fantastic experience and history and she's such a hard worker.

07:42.980 --> 07:45.980
She had the most professional application.

07:45.980 --> 07:51.980
Even though English is in her first language and now I got them, I say you're impressive.

07:51.980 --> 07:52.980
Then Azura.

07:52.980 --> 07:56.980
Okay, I describe Azura as my little diamond in the rough.

07:56.980 --> 07:59.980
Now hear me out before you're like, it's not an insult, relax.

07:59.980 --> 08:01.980
I'm not told the full story yet.

08:01.980 --> 08:08.980
I was going to cross off Azura's stream as I was reviewing her because she wasn't talking.

08:08.980 --> 08:09.980
She wasn't interacting.

08:09.980 --> 08:13.980
And then she said three words in that voice.

08:13.980 --> 08:15.980
Azura.

08:15.980 --> 08:17.980
She instantly became Azura.

08:17.980 --> 08:20.980
She said three words and she got the damn part.

08:20.980 --> 08:21.980
Sheebie.

08:21.980 --> 08:22.980
Sheebie is everything.

08:22.980 --> 08:24.980
I should have been in another life, okay?

08:24.980 --> 08:27.980
I could not have asked for better gen mates.

08:27.980 --> 08:33.980
I am blown away that these girls even have freaking applied to such a crazy idea.

08:33.980 --> 08:40.980
And here we are, debut and you guys have shown nothing but love and support and we are all so thankful.

08:40.980 --> 08:44.980
I'm sure I speak for all of us when we were like, holy fuck, thank you.

08:44.980 --> 08:47.980
Right, let me take you to Zabbit.

08:47.980 --> 08:49.980
I forgot to pull it.

08:50.980 --> 08:51.980
It's for decoration.

08:51.980 --> 08:53.980
Okay, the tentacle in the back is for decoration.

08:53.980 --> 08:55.980
Let me do the full body.

08:55.980 --> 08:56.980
Let's start with the full body.

08:56.980 --> 09:00.980
It may have a bandaid on for reasons.

09:00.980 --> 09:03.980
But as you see, I got some swivelly hips.

09:03.980 --> 09:05.980
Thank you, Nari.

09:05.980 --> 09:10.980
So if you didn't know, I actually have what's known as a French manicure and pedicure.

09:10.980 --> 09:11.980
Again.

09:11.980 --> 09:14.980
Don't even be careful with my thighs because of the bandaid.

09:14.980 --> 09:15.980
Is this smart?

09:15.980 --> 09:16.980
Is this what?

09:16.980 --> 09:17.980
Okay, okay.

09:17.980 --> 09:18.980
I don't think that's smart.

09:18.980 --> 09:23.980
As you can see, if you look really close to the elbows, I have pearlescent to my outfit.

09:23.980 --> 09:26.980
My outfit isn't white, it's pearlescent.

09:26.980 --> 09:28.980
So I shimmer as I move about.

09:28.980 --> 09:29.980
It's fantastic.

09:29.980 --> 09:31.980
And so does my seashells at the top too.

09:31.980 --> 09:38.980
But yeah, I'm in the Yukata because it's a homage to Japanese culture because without Japanese culture, let's be honest.

09:38.980 --> 09:39.980
Any VTubers would be here.

09:39.980 --> 09:41.980
Okay, let me get real close.

09:41.980 --> 09:43.980
Hopefully this isn't uncomfortable.

09:43.980 --> 09:46.980
I know some people aren't like the best with eye contact.

09:49.980 --> 09:52.980
If I open my eyes, it opens too.

09:52.980 --> 09:54.980
Oh, and I'm sad.

09:54.980 --> 09:55.980
I'm sad.

09:55.980 --> 09:57.980
I have pupil restrict.

09:57.980 --> 09:59.980
What did you say?

09:59.980 --> 10:01.980
I'm on a muse.

10:01.980 --> 10:02.980
You failed me.

10:02.980 --> 10:04.980
These are my heart eyes.

10:04.980 --> 10:05.980
I love them.

10:08.980 --> 10:10.980
You ever seen a blushing cultfish before?

10:10.980 --> 10:13.980
You know how cultfish have hypnotic patterns?

10:13.980 --> 10:15.980
May I please do this for you?

10:15.980 --> 10:16.980
Are you ready?

10:19.980 --> 10:20.980
Hey.

10:21.980 --> 10:24.980
We're going to be using this for a lot of ASMR.

10:24.980 --> 10:25.980
I don't know.

10:25.980 --> 10:29.980
But if you're really struggling, like if you're really struggling, how about this?

10:33.980 --> 10:34.980
Yeah, it's over for you.

10:34.980 --> 10:36.980
Just admit it, it's over for you.

10:36.980 --> 10:38.980
I mean, how can you resist?

10:38.980 --> 10:40.980
How can you resist this little Scottish accent?
