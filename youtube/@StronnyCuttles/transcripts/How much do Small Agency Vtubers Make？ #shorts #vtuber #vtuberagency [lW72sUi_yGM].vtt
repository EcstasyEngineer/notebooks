How much money does being a smaller agency VTuber actually make you?

00:03.760 --> 00:06.640
$12,084.03

00:06.640 --> 00:10.720
Oh, you thought I was gonna ask the question and not actually answer it?

00:10.720 --> 00:12.960
Nah, I don't gatekeep, so let's break it down.

00:12.960 --> 00:17.360
I made $5,265.85 on stream elements.

00:17.360 --> 00:19.040
That's tips during streaming.

00:19.040 --> 00:23.600
$3,456.53 on Patreon.

00:23.600 --> 00:27.920
From the alternative audios I offer on the site.

00:27.920 --> 00:32.880
Then $3,361.35 from YouTube,

00:32.880 --> 00:35.200
which includes memberships, super chats,

00:35.200 --> 00:38.320
and money generated from ads watched by you, the viewer.

00:38.320 --> 00:40.720
Side note, I stream every single day.

00:40.720 --> 00:44.160
This does not include my 100% cut from Ubu Market Marriage.

00:44.160 --> 00:45.440
This is just my first month,

00:45.440 --> 00:49.200
so I cannot thank you enough for liking, commenting, and subscribing to support me.

00:49.200 --> 00:53.600
And as always, hold back 30% of your income for the tax man.
