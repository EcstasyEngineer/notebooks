1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:13,200
That's fucking bright, that's what that is.

2
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:15,560
Hold on, let me put on a live chat.

3
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,000
You can tell that.

4
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:32,400
YouTube put me live right now, I demand it. I want to see my replays.

5
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:45,200
Feel the fun.

6
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:55,200
Good morning, good evening, good afternoon.

7
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:59,200
Wait, why did I hear myself?

8
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:05,200
Infinite lip of my own self by accident.

9
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:08,200
It didn't mean I whipsed it.

10
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:15,200
Good morning, good afternoon.

11
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:19,200
Good morning, good evening, good afternoon.

12
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:31,200
What's that? You thought we were going to play Pig Kitty, a little city?

13
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:37,200
How about a 12 hour endurance stream?

14
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:42,200
How about a chicken endurance stream on Viva Pina?

15
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:47,200
I will update the thumbnail.

16
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:50,200
I am the milkman, my milk is delicious.

17
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:54,200
I need to warm up to the endurance.

18
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:57,200
What better game to do it on than a childhood game?

19
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,200
Oh, I'm a game pros.

20
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:03,200
No Viva Pina, the profile has been found. Do you want to create one?

21
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:12,200
I'm using the Xbox servers to do this.

22
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:15,200
So I think we're going to get a gamer score as well.

23
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:19,200
So my dream of having 100,000 gamer scores is still alive.

24
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:21,200
It's just going to take me a whole second.

25
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:24,200
But it's still alive, I'm still alive.

26
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:27,200
Keep the thumbnail please, it's perfect the way it is.

27
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:29,200
Are you joking? It's terrible.

28
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:33,200
Right, before I get too invested in the game,

29
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:36,200
can I talk on the main screen for just a hot second, okay?

30
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:42,200
Azura, Emmie and Strone's Patrons have been updated with an audio.

31
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:44,200
There are now audios on those if you didn't know.

32
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:50,200
So if you're a big bro, you're a blatant heart, or you are a strong soul.

33
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:52,200
Are you squiddin' me right now?

34
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:54,200
Tim Shuttle, thank you for the extended membership.

35
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:56,200
Already been a month, feels like yesterday that you played Avatar.

36
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:58,200
Is that when you did it?

37
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:03,200
Is that when you became a member during the Avatar stream when I was raging?

38
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:07,200
Because I didn't know you had to cheese on the one weapon.

39
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:10,200
A lot of Azura shorts dropped.

40
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:13,200
Yes, there should be Azura shorts as well.

41
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:16,200
I need to check on Sheeby's shorts.

42
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:19,200
She has two from Elden Ring, but they both got limited ads

43
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:22,200
because I think she swore but I sent away.

44
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:25,200
So YouTube put a load of limited ads on Azura stuff and I was like,

45
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:30,200
No, fuck this, I'm gonna ask for a review and so much stuff got taken off.

46
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:34,200
And I think YouTube is just a target, I can't believe it.

47
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:39,200
But yeah, I remember the Avatar rage stream.

48
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:41,200
Yeah, I'm sorry if I scared anyone.

49
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:43,200
I was raging.

50
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:46,200
That was the first hint of a Scottish rage.

51
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:51,200
But yes, there are Azura shorts if you want to check them out.

52
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:56,200
One of them has a really good little, I don't know if the one I want.

53
00:03:56,200 --> 00:04:00,200
There's an asset in it that I got custom made for one of her shorts,

54
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:03,200
which was a cereal brand of hers.

55
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:08,200
And if you pause on it and actually read the asset is outrageous.

56
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:12,200
It's outrageous if you read it.

57
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:15,200
Oh, I heard good things about this game.

58
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:17,200
Oh, this is a wonderful game.

59
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:19,200
I cannot wait to share it with you.

60
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:21,200
It's a fantastic game.

61
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:25,200
It's so peaceful and fun and you can do creativity.

62
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:28,200
Scared is not what I felt when you're right.

63
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:30,200
No, I'm just supposed to say that part of it.

64
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:32,200
I have good news.

65
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:39,200
I have just changed my sleep totally thanks to modern medicine and the ability to drug myself to sleep.

66
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:46,200
I woke up an hour and a half ago and I recorded the pregnancy ASMR.

67
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:48,200
I need to record the foley sounds next.

68
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:55,200
And by foley sounds, I mean I need to record my stomach sounds and my heartbeat and potentially soft breathing.

69
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:58,200
And then I can put that masterpiece together.

70
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:01,200
Okay, I did soft spoken.

71
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:10,200
I don't know if it was the right choice, but I'm going to put an effect on my voice to make it like I'm outside the womb and you're inside the womb.

72
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:13,200
So I'm very excited to see how that video comes together.

73
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:25,200
I am going to go and put subtitles on the video as well because I think it would be a shame that such a meme masterpiece doesn't get subtitles.

74
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:27,200
I can't wait for my new fav ASMR ever.

75
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:30,200
Smash that like button, subscribe and ring the bell.

76
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:32,200
Thank you, you guys are doing a much better job than me.

77
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:40,200
As for any behind the scenes stuff, I don't think there's any updates to anything I can say publicly at the moment.

78
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:44,200
Icicle has taken our break.

79
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:50,200
So for any snowberries, I'd say Rippin' Piss, but she would piss on you.

80
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:52,200
So is that really what you want?

81
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:54,200
But she's taken a wee break.

82
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:56,200
Just bing-chilling.

83
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:58,200
So no leaks today?

84
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:00,200
No, I don't think so.

85
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:06,200
I don't think I have any leaks at all that I can think about.

86
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:13,200
Emmy got clipped by a big clip-in channel and I think over 5,000 people have seen her mountains.

87
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:22,200
You know what, out of speculation, I'm going to see how many people have seen my little sister's mountains.

88
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:24,200
60,000 people have seen my little sister's mountains.

89
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:26,200
How dare they?

90
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:28,200
How dare they?

91
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:30,200
60,000...

92
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:39,200
Oh, okay.

93
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:42,200
Well, you know what, as long as she's having a good time, that's the main thing.

94
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:48,200
60,000 people? All me.

95
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:51,200
I can't believe we just created 60,000 big bros.

96
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:52,200
I can't believe it.

97
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:54,200
Just like her valleys.

98
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:55,200
Hi!

99
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:56,200
Thanks for joining.

100
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:57,200
How's joining?

101
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:58,200
How are you?

102
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:00,200
Any epic game leaks?

103
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:03,200
What, from a fucking development company?

104
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:05,200
I've seen the video game for viewers.

105
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:09,200
It's delayed until next month, most likely.

106
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:16,200
There's currently three out of six animations, so we're 50% of the way there.

107
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:22,200
I think maybe halfway through August, we could ship it.

108
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:24,200
I don't know, I'd attend.

109
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:26,200
Brian.

110
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:32,200
Nice try, but I had to change the TTS, Brian.

111
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:37,200
Just because I got feedback.

112
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:39,200
Oh no, my gamer tag!

113
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:41,200
It got late!

114
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:46,200
I'm just kidding, it's not a big deal.

115
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:49,200
It's absolutely not a big deal, I assure you.

116
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:51,200
No one cares.

117
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:53,200
No one cares, I can assure you.

118
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:01,200
Did I need to turn it up?

119
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:15,200
Oh, do you want to dig my hole in front of your seat?

120
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:35,200
My background music's on?

121
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:41,200
I didn't know.

122
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:44,200
Oh, my cup of tea, I'm going to forget.

123
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:46,200
I made a little cup of tea.

124
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:58,200
What beautiful music.

125
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:04,200
Aww.

126
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:14,200
Oh dear, oh dear, oh dear.

127
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:16,200
What's wrong?

128
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:21,200
Literally the women crying, but we're trying to enjoy the environment.

129
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:24,200
Colorful like Crash Bandicoot.

130
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:26,200
So what's the game about?

131
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:28,200
Let's find out.

132
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:30,200
Let's see.

133
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:32,200
Her name's Leifos.

134
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:46,200
Hi Leifos.

135
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:47,200
Hi Leifos.

136
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:49,200
Are you here to help me?

137
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:51,200
Help me Leifos, help me.

138
00:09:51,200 --> 00:10:03,200
Oh, look, I just realized I completely covered up the journal there.

139
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:09,200
Okay.

140
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:11,200
Press X to open up the menu.

141
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:21,200
I love being, I'm going to say something controversial.

142
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:25,200
I love being spoken to like I'm a child.

143
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:28,200
This is the journal.

144
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:35,200
It stores all the information that you discover while you are playing the game.

145
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:41,200
The journal is split up into different parts to make it easier to find what you need.

146
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:47,200
And then again, I did just record ASMR where you are my literal child in my stomach.

147
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:49,200
So yeah, maybe I do enjoy it.

148
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:51,200
What are you going to do?

149
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:55,200
Oh no, not age plate.

150
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:57,200
No.

151
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:04,200
Oh, I'm covering it up.

152
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:06,200
Alright, where'd I go?

153
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:08,200
I'll go right here.

154
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:10,200
I'm going to camp on chat.

155
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:12,200
Okay, I'm going right here.

156
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:24,200
Good job reading that.

157
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:26,200
You're doing so good.

158
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:28,200
Stop.

159
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:30,200
I'll simply enjoy it.

160
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:32,200
Baby talk.

161
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:35,200
Not for me.

162
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:41,200
Okay, so we're going through the tutorial and what to do, but she's going to...

163
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:44,200
So we've entered a garden, but it's all messed up, isn't it?

164
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:46,200
So what are we going to do?

165
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:48,200
Are we going to help out Leifos?

166
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:50,200
I think we are, I think we are.

167
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:52,200
We've got a shovel, but it's all banged up.

168
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:04,200
So we're going to press X and we're going to open up the shovel.

169
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:06,200
So now we are going to help...

170
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:08,200
Oh.

171
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:10,200
I forget about how much talk in there is if you don't skip it.

172
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:13,200
That's one busted ass shovel, literally.

173
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:15,200
Who destroyed the garden? Which one of you did it?

174
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:17,200
Oh, no, no, no, it wasn't.

175
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:19,200
Reflans that destroyed the garden.

176
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:22,200
We are one with nature, whether that sea or land.

177
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:24,200
One with nature.

178
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:26,200
We're going to help you.

179
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:28,200
Press Y now.

180
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:30,200
Press Y now.

181
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:33,200
So that's our bird's eye view of the garden.

182
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:35,200
Do you see that white outline?

183
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:38,200
That's the space that we can manipulate and do what we please with, okay?

184
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:42,200
On the left, top left is Leifos's house.

185
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:46,200
That pathway on the left is where any helpers for the garden will enter.

186
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:50,200
And then on the right is Das Tardos.

187
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:52,200
You need to clear away the jumps.

188
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:54,200
Who's the baddie?

189
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:56,200
Can we have that view on you?

190
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:58,200
Real true.

191
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:00,200
How much will happen until you clear some grounds?

192
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:02,200
Until you clear some grounds?

193
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:04,200
Okay.

194
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:06,200
So we've done that.

195
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:08,200
We're just going to click the analog stick,

196
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:10,200
and that means we'll move a lot faster.

197
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:13,200
If you click the left analog stick, you'll start zooming.

198
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:16,200
So we are to clear some soil.

199
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:18,200
So there's currently hard soil.

200
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:20,200
That golden hue, that's hard soil.

201
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:22,200
We need to whack away.

202
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:25,200
We need to clean everything with hard soil.

203
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:28,200
A worm!

204
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:30,200
I love that!

205
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:32,200
They're so cute!

206
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:34,200
I'm going to cream!

207
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:36,200
I really custard my creams.

208
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:38,200
They're so cute!

209
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:40,200
Well done. You attracted a worm.

210
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:44,200
The worm has turned up because you have uncovered some good soil.

211
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:46,200
I suck you!

212
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:48,200
I suck you.

213
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:52,200
So what we're going to do is get rid of all the hard soil.

214
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:54,200
Because if we don't,

215
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:59,200
we can't actually manipulate anything in the garden at all.

216
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:02,200
So we're going to go around the edge, do the perimeter.

217
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:04,200
You don't know how to edge, right?

218
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:10,200
Anyone who listened to the Patreon audio yesterday?

219
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:12,200
Oh actually!

220
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:14,200
Wait, no one gave me feedback on Marshmallow!

221
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:16,200
Sometimes I get feedback from my audios,

222
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:18,200
or they're like,

223
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:20,200
oh I really enjoyed this audio,

224
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:22,200
because you did this one thing in it.

225
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:25,200
You need to give me feedback if my audios are shy or not.

226
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:28,200
I need to know if they are shy or not.

227
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:31,200
Maybe I need to change what I'm doing.

228
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:36,200
The Yale!

229
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:38,200
We're now destroying all the junk that's been left behind.

230
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:42,200
And the currency in this game is chocolate coins.

231
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:44,200
Because the game's theme is pinatas.

232
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:46,200
What happens when you whack a pinata?

233
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:48,200
All the sweeties fall out!

234
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:56,200
I haven't listened to it, I was planning to after the stream.

235
00:14:56,200 --> 00:15:00,200
Oh boy, you've got 12 hours of edge!

236
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:02,200
So we need to make...

237
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:06,200
Wow! You've smashed all the debris in the area already!

238
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:07,200
Yay!

239
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:10,200
As a reward, take this grass seed packet.

240
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:12,200
It never runs out of seeds.

241
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:14,200
Press A.

242
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:16,200
Oh, you never run out of seeds.

243
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:18,200
Can I call you guys a grass packet?

244
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:20,200
Choose your new grass seed packet.

245
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:22,200
You can hurt Leifos, but I don't want to,

246
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:24,200
because that's the evil choice.

247
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:26,200
Is the game too loud, or did I turn it down again?

248
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:28,200
I did turn it up quite a bit.

249
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:30,200
More than I usually do.

250
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:34,200
Many games are down by 10 decibels.

251
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:36,200
Maybe even down to 15 over me.

252
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:38,200
Audio's perfect.

253
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:40,200
Such a good streamer.

254
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:42,200
Alright, let's pick up these coins.

255
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:45,200
And then we're going to put some grass down.

256
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:47,200
So now that we look at the bird's eye view,

257
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:50,200
we see we've got most of the hard soil.

258
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:52,200
But don't worry, we can deal with the weir ones.

259
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:54,200
It's not a problem.

260
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:56,200
So we're going to add some grass to the garden

261
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:58,200
to help the nature bloom.

262
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:01,200
What did Brian say?

263
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:03,200
Hello, I am Brian, the voice of the people

264
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:05,200
and the secret reason everyone comes to stream.

265
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:06,200
Anonymous.

266
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:07,200
Hi, Johnny.

267
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:10,200
It's amazing how much influence you have on me

268
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:13,200
and how your fans when...

269
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:16,200
and your fans when I'm having a shite day at work

270
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:18,200
and hear my notification pop off

271
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:20,200
and I see you're the girls live.

272
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:22,200
It sounds pathetic, but okay.

273
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:23,200
That's not pathetic.

274
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:25,200
You're allowed to have happiness.

275
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:27,200
You're allowed to have joy in things

276
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:29,200
that genuinely make you happy.

277
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:32,200
I am so sorry that you have been taught

278
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:34,200
like you should be embarrassed

279
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:36,200
about the things you enjoy

280
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:38,200
or you shouldn't be allowed to enjoy it

281
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:39,200
because of XYZ.

282
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:41,200
I am sorry that you feel that way.

283
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:43,200
Please don't ever feel that way with us.

284
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:45,200
If you genuinely de-stress

285
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:47,200
or find happiness in the small things,

286
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:50,200
even if that's a random fucking Scottish girl

287
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:52,200
that's streaming,

288
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:54,200
and that's what gives you happiness,

289
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:56,200
fuck yeah, take any ounce of serotonin

290
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:58,200
at the end of your day and age

291
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:00,200
because sure as hell I know you need it.

292
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:02,200
I'm sorry, but it's so miserable out there

293
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:03,200
in that cold world.

294
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:06,200
If your respite is literally listening

295
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:08,200
to a Scottish person rumble their arse off

296
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:10,200
while playing childhood games,

297
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:11,200
fucking eat it.

298
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:14,200
Fucking take a bite of that juicy sandwich

299
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:16,200
that's being offered to you

300
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:18,200
and fucking enjoy it and chew it

301
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:19,200
and have a good time.

302
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:21,200
Oh, we have a worm!

303
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:23,200
Hello, little baby.

304
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:25,200
Worm, you're getting called a replaying.

305
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:28,200
You're getting called...

306
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:30,200
Oh no, you're getting called a wormling!

307
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:33,200
Oh my god, I'm going to name everything after you guys.

308
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:35,200
Okay, I'm going to skip that.

309
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:37,200
No, not the encyclopedia, I want to change his name.

310
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:45,200
Wait, I can't rename you yet?

311
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:46,200
Wait, how do I rename you?

312
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:47,200
Oh, there you go.

313
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:49,200
Right, worm.

314
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:51,200
And then we're just going to add ling to everything

315
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:52,200
at the end.

316
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:53,200
Boom.

317
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:55,200
Alright, boom!

318
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:56,200
20G!

319
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:58,200
Oh no, I need to get out of the way of the notifications.

320
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:01,200
Okay, I'll put myself here, okay.

321
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:04,200
Look, it's a wormling!

322
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:06,200
Oh, now I'm in the way of the game.

323
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:08,200
For fuck's sake, I'm going over here.

324
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:10,200
I'm going over here, I can't do it.

325
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:12,200
A dangling!

326
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:14,200
Would you still love us if we were worm?

327
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:17,200
Yeah, it's a willying!

328
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:19,200
I'm just adding in to the end of it.

329
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:21,200
Oh, we got a birdie!

330
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:23,200
A sparrow-mentling!

331
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:27,200
Oh, look at him go!

332
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:29,200
I'll show you my worm-ling.

333
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:32,200
Yeah.

334
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:36,200
It makes me happy to see Strony Planet of the Sea.

335
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:41,200
Not a worm, we're like a snake.

336
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:45,200
We are now closer to Mome.

337
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:48,200
Do you want to use sparrows fight with worms?

338
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:50,200
No, not on their own.

339
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:52,200
You have to actually tell them to go fight.

340
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:53,200
Right.

341
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:55,200
I'm going to put this right here.

342
00:18:58,200 --> 00:18:59,200
Sparrow first sighting.

343
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:02,200
A ward for having a wormy.

344
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:04,200
The struggles of every streamer

345
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:07,200
figuring out where to place themselves.

346
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:08,200
Oh, I didn't play!

347
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:10,200
I'm like, where?

348
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:12,200
Where did I do it so I don't get in the way?

349
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:13,200
But I think this is the corner.

350
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:14,200
Okay.

351
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:15,200
And then this is...

352
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:16,200
Oh my god!

353
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:18,200
So this is worm-ling.

354
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:20,200
And then...

355
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:23,200
Worm-ling and...

356
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:25,200
Squirm...

357
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:26,200
Se...

358
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:27,200
Que...

359
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:28,200
Yu...

360
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:29,200
Er...

361
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:30,200
M...

362
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:31,200
Ling...

363
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:34,200
Sorry, this is how our spell out looks.

364
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:35,200
Hee hee!

365
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:36,200
There we go!

366
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:37,200
We go!

367
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:39,200
Worm-ling and Squirm-ling!

368
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:41,200
And they're a couple and they're going to kiss.

369
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:44,200
We're going to do lots of kisses together.

370
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:46,200
Thank you Kaidon for the super chat.

371
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:48,200
I appreciate it.

372
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:50,200
Oh, also, I have to apologise.

373
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:52,200
I checked Marshmallow.

374
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:54,200
Apparently I've stopped a male Vtuber

375
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:56,200
without realising it.

376
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:59,200
In the chat!

377
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:00,200
I couldn't...

378
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:02,200
I can't see the profile pictures that well

379
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:04,200
because I've not got my glasses on.

380
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:06,200
And I thought it was just like a random

381
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:08,200
anime thing.

382
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:09,200
And I didn't realise it was a this.

383
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:10,200
I do apologise.

384
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:12,200
That one's on me, chief.

385
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:14,200
I do put my hand up and say,

386
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:15,200
whoops, didn't have my glasses on.

387
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:17,200
So I do apologise for that one.

388
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:21,200
Male Vtuber in chat!

389
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:22,200
Honestly, stop!

390
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:23,200
I was like,

391
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:25,200
oh my god, I had no fucking idea.

392
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:27,200
Because I was going off on one being

393
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:28,200
like,

394
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:30,200
oh, watashi wa strony desu.

395
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:32,200
Like, oh my god, cringe.

396
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:33,200
Cringe!

397
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:34,200
Cringe.

398
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:36,200
Right, okay, let's add some more grass.

399
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:38,200
Some more grassy ass.

400
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:40,200
So the gear dyn.

401
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:41,200
Gear dyn.

402
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:44,200
We need a water league to complete the gear dyn.

403
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:47,200
What if a worm is called finger?

404
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:49,200
Why would you call it finger?

405
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:52,200
I like...

406
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:53,200
I like...

407
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:56,200
I like wormling and squirmling

408
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:59,200
for the couple of worms in my gear dyn.

409
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:01,200
Wow.

410
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:03,200
Anano kawaii ne.

411
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:05,200
Momolo, thank you for the super chat.

412
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:06,200
Anano kawaii ne.

413
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:08,200
A fingerling.

414
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:09,200
No!

415
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:11,200
You're not calling a fingerling.

416
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:14,200
Shawnee, was Brian permanently disabled

417
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:15,200
for our donors?

418
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:16,200
No!

419
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:19,200
The threshold is $3 at the moment.

420
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:23,200
The noise won't play or TTS won't play unless

421
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:25,200
it's $3 or MioR.

422
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:26,200
MioR.

423
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:27,200
I finished!

424
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:28,200
I did it!

425
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:30,200
It's Willy the Builder!

426
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:32,200
Wait, is he from...

427
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:34,200
Wait, is this an accent based on New York?

428
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:35,200
I finished.

429
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:37,200
The house has been built.

430
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:40,200
Get out of your shovel and smash the site open

431
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:42,200
and reveal my handiwork.

432
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:45,200
Reveal my handiwork.

433
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:47,200
Hey, I'm walking near.

434
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:49,200
Oh, look it!

435
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:51,200
Look at your new home!

436
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:53,200
Oh, he loves it!

437
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:55,200
Now that you've provided the worms

438
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:56,200
with everything they need,

439
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:58,200
the hearts above their heads

440
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:00,200
are ready to roam us.

441
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:01,200
Mine's the fudge hogs.

442
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:02,200
Oh, my God.

443
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:03,200
The fudge hog is so awkward to get

444
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:06,200
because you have to plant a naughty seed to get it.

445
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:11,200
I'm slurping my tea before it gets cold.

446
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:14,200
Oh, squirmling and wormling.

447
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:16,200
It's time to shag!

448
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:18,200
Right, off you go.

449
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:19,200
Off you pop.

450
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:20,200
Both of you go.

451
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:21,200
Kiss and stuff.

452
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:23,200
Look at that.

453
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:24,200
Let's get an action shot.

454
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:26,200
Oh, we got the action camera.

455
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:27,200
Right, come on.

456
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:29,200
Time to do the romance dance

457
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:30,200
is what it's called in this game,

458
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:32,200
to repopulate your garden.

459
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:36,200
They are...

460
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:39,200
So, this sucks.

461
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:41,200
Come and get me, says the worm.

462
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:43,200
Come and get me, Rufus.

463
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:45,200
Let's do what?

464
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:54,200
Now, there is a coin top, like, middle left,

465
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:56,200
if you can see it, but I never go for it.

466
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:58,200
It's so loud.

467
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:00,200
The Riz minigame, real and true.

468
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:03,200
Wormling and squirreling are going to have six.

469
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:05,200
It's five babies,

470
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:07,200
and then we'll get an achievement for them.

471
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:08,200
We'll get a little accolade,

472
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:09,200
not an achievement in-game,

473
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:11,200
but we'll get an accolade.

474
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:12,200
Or maybe...

475
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:13,200
Who goes there?

476
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:15,200
The worms are going to...

477
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:16,200
Are you ready to watch?

478
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:17,200
Oh, no, wait, wait.

479
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:18,200
We're going to get a camera.

480
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:19,200
Are you ready for this?

481
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:21,200
We're about to get a cut scene

482
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:25,200
to watch them do their romance dance.

483
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:27,200
Romance dance?

484
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:28,200
Would you...

485
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:30,200
There's going to be so much romance dancing

486
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:32,200
at the convention.

487
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:36,200
Oh!

488
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:37,200
Oh, should I get it?

489
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:38,200
Ooh.

490
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:39,200
Oh.

491
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:41,200
Bye.

492
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:42,200
Bye.

493
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:43,200
Oh, hold on.

494
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:44,200
My calibration is off.

495
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:45,200
It's real good.

496
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:51,200
Bye.

497
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:52,200
Re-calibrated.

498
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:53,200
Oh, yeah.

499
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:54,200
Come on.

500
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:55,200
Come on.

501
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:56,200
Look at them moves.

502
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:57,200
Oh, hit it, hit it, hit it, hit it.

503
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:58,200
Eee.

504
00:23:58,200 --> 00:23:59,200
Storkos!

505
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:01,200
It's the egg delivery lady.

506
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:02,200
Hello.

507
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:03,200
Hi, Storkos.

508
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:05,200
I like her head.

509
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:07,200
It carries the egg.

510
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:11,200
Your pinatas have made an egg.

511
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:14,200
After pinatas have done the romance dance,

512
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:17,200
a new baby pinata is brought to the garden.

513
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:19,200
Safely packed in a patterned egg.

514
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:21,200
Safely packed in a patterned...

515
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:24,200
Ooh, look, we got an accolade for humping.

516
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:26,200
Oh, my God.

517
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:28,200
I should do that.

518
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:31,200
At the convention,

519
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:33,200
I'll get, like, little stamps,

520
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:35,200
and then it'll be, like,

521
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:36,200
strongy stood on me,

522
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:38,200
strongy humped me.

523
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:41,200
And then, like, stamp your hand

524
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:43,200
as proof that I did something to you.

525
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:46,200
I'll get, like, a unique stamp for it.

526
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:49,200
She has some real quantities.

527
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:51,200
She got some big personality.

528
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:52,200
That's what I'm saying.

529
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:56,200
Yay!

530
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:58,200
Our egg is delivered already.

531
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:04,200
The people's champion.

532
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:07,200
Strongy stepped on me with glee.

533
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:08,200
50 cents, please.

534
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:16,200
Are you squiddin' me right now?

535
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:33,200
I can make people laugh like you.

536
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:35,200
Yeah, you can do it.

537
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:37,200
You just gotta put your mind to it.

538
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:40,200
And please don't think it happens overnight, either.

539
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:41,200
Ah, we got bird!

540
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:42,200
Birdling!

541
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:45,200
And please don't think it happens overnight.

542
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:48,200
I've been farting around for many years now.

543
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:50,200
I like farting around.

544
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:53,200
But I'm very happy where I am now.

545
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:56,200
And I got a lot of experience along the way.

546
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:59,200
Please don't think things have to happen overnight, either.

547
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:01,200
I don't know how that works.

548
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:03,200
Sparrowling.

549
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:05,200
That's right, everyone's getting little wings.

550
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:10,200
Can we smash birdpina?

551
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:13,200
Don't say such horrible things in my chat!

552
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:15,200
There's no such thing as a bad pina.

553
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:17,200
Just a misunderstood one.

554
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:18,200
He's not a bad boy.

555
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:20,200
Sparrowling's a good boy.

556
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:23,200
And we've even got snakeling over here.

557
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:25,200
Let's go do that.

558
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:26,200
Okay, so we're gonna...

559
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:27,200
Everyone's gonna hump.

560
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:28,200
Hump hump.

561
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:30,200
Because we need five more humps.

562
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:32,200
And then we get an accolade.

563
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:34,200
Wait, don't the sparrowlings eat?

564
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:36,200
They eat them to romance.

565
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:39,200
But you have to send them to attack the worms.

566
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:42,200
So you have to be the one to give the commands.

567
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:44,200
They won't do it, though.

568
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:45,200
Oh, sorry!

569
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:47,200
Baby piñata can cune information.

570
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:49,200
Oopsies!

571
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:51,200
Is this the base game or trouble in Paradise?

572
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:54,200
This is the base Viva piñata.

573
00:26:54,200 --> 00:27:00,200
I personally struggled to get into trouble in Paradise.

574
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:03,200
My dad bought me trouble in Paradise.

575
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:05,200
And I didn't understand that...

576
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:07,200
Like, because I was very young.

577
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:13,200
I like, didn't understand that although it was like the same IP of Viva piñata,

578
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:15,200
I remember asking him like,

579
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:17,200
Dad, why isn't this game the same?

580
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:20,200
And he was like, oh, that's what they do.

581
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:23,200
When they release a new game, they have to change it up.

582
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:28,200
And I was distraught that trouble in Paradise wasn't like an exact copy.

583
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:30,200
Oh, reeflings! Your choice!

584
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:34,200
A turnip seed or a carrot seed.

585
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:38,200
What would you like me to pick?

586
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:42,200
A purple turnip or an orange carrot?

587
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:45,200
Carrot, carrot, carrot.

588
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:48,200
Turnip, turnip, carrot, carrot.

589
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:50,200
Turnip, turnip, purple, carrot.

590
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:52,200
Right, carrot, turnip, carrot.

591
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:53,200
Carrot, carrot, carrot.

592
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:56,200
Okay, I think carrot won. Holy crap.

593
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:59,200
Don't worry, we'll get the other ones soon, TM.

594
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:02,200
You've got two Sparrow Mint residents now.

595
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:04,200
You've got two birdies!

596
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:07,200
The next stage is to get them to...

597
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:08,200
To Bowman's!

598
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:13,200
Okay, let me breed the freaking worms a bit more then.

599
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:16,200
Sorry, the color was more important.

600
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:21,200
You planted your seed, but you'll need to water it to help it grow.

601
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:25,200
Without water, the plant will turn yellowy brown and die.

602
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:31,200
If your plant starts turning blue, you're giving it too much water which can also kill it.

603
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:37,200
Go back to the garden by pressing A, then press X to find your new water plant.

604
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:41,200
Ah, it's busted up, but I love it because it does the job.

605
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:43,200
Just because...

606
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:47,200
I don't even know where I planted it.

607
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:53,200
Okay, we are going through the tutorial stage, so we are going to have a lot of pop-ups still.

608
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:57,200
My point, exactly.

609
00:28:57,200 --> 00:29:00,200
I forget how many pop-ups there are unless she's thingy.

610
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:04,200
But we've got a carrot now, so guess what? We're going to get a bunny.

611
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:08,200
Knowing how much Trani likes to seed.

612
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:11,200
Oh, I love doing my thing.

613
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:14,200
I'm going to overwater on purpose.

614
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:18,200
Look at all these worms that can breed.

615
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:22,200
Oh, they're kind of glitching out a little bit.

616
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:24,200
Is this having a wee time?

617
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:26,200
Okay, they're just waiting for the egg lady.

618
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:27,200
There she is!

619
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:30,200
And then that's right. Get back to breeding!

620
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:33,200
We now have the egg. Get back in there.

621
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:35,200
I'm not done with you yet.

622
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:38,200
Get breeding.

623
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:40,200
Don't you dare go out of bounds.

624
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:42,200
Oh, you can't select them right away after the bread.

625
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:44,200
Right, go hump each other.

626
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:45,200
That's right.

627
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:49,200
Get to work on my breeding farm.

628
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:54,200
Trani, are you a pinata?

629
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:57,200
Because I'd like to breed more of you!

630
00:29:57,200 --> 00:30:01,200
When I was doing the pregnancy ASMR, I was like,

631
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:03,200
you're going to come out just like your mommy.

632
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:06,200
You're going to be a little gamer and you're going to have all my traits

633
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:08,200
and you're going to have a good time.

634
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:11,200
I might get my blanket, actually, because it's an endurance stream.

635
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:14,200
I'm sorry to anyone who thought it was going to be a short stream.

636
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:16,200
Get plopped, get plopped, get plopped.

637
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:18,200
I'm doing endurance stream.

638
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:22,200
Okay, I'm going to very quickly.

639
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:23,200
You guys look at...

640
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:25,200
Oh, bunny comb!

641
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:27,200
Bunny combling.

642
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:31,200
Just don't make the parent and the child or else you might summon Imi.

643
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:33,200
Now, hold on a minute.

644
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:34,200
Siblings.

645
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:37,200
Isn't it all weird that you can breed children in this game?

646
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:39,200
No, they're not children.

647
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:41,200
They're pinata.

648
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:44,200
Okay, I'm going to let you guys watch over my game

649
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:46,200
whilst I go get a blanket, okay?

650
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:50,200
Because I forgot my blanket and I'm cutting the circulation on the leg off.

651
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:51,200
Hold on.

652
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:53,200
I might actually get a kind of...

653
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:11,200
Okay.

654
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:31,200
Sorry, my blanket, wait!

655
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:33,200
It's to show the garden.

656
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:36,200
The reeflings were supposed to be watching over the garden.

657
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:38,200
Sorry, my blanket was in bed.

658
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:43,580
Well done. You attracted a moth drop. Oh, it's night time. Okay. This is our first night times

659
00:31:43,580 --> 00:31:48,820
We're about to go through the 24-hour recycle in game if you oh, we haven't unlocked the clock yet

660
00:31:48,820 --> 00:31:54,380
So we can't see it, but we'll get it soon. Nope. Kaidon's iron. Don't it don't give me money for walking away

661
00:31:55,460 --> 00:31:56,860
midstream

662
00:31:56,860 --> 00:32:03,500
A moth drop is like a cough drop. Yes all the name all the names in game are related to a sweetie or

663
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:09,140
Something along those lines like carrot like a like a sweet treat

664
00:32:09,860 --> 00:32:13,420
And like cough drop. No, no, no, don't go in you need to hump again

665
00:32:14,660 --> 00:32:16,960
Okay, we just caught it in time

666
00:32:20,060 --> 00:32:25,460
Catching a moth drop. I think I need to buy I need to unlock the shop, but I haven't yet

667
00:32:26,020 --> 00:32:29,500
But the the character at the shop is called lorry

668
00:32:29,980 --> 00:32:33,380
But we're gonna get so much gamer score for this

669
00:32:33,380 --> 00:32:38,460
I think this will be our first thousand gamer score. I am gonna really visit Skyrim. Um

670
00:32:38,780 --> 00:32:45,900
And I'll just I think what I'll do is I'll put all of the achievements that we need to get in Skyrim on the site of

671
00:32:46,100 --> 00:32:51,700
The stream so people can see like oh, we're definitely trying to aim for this right you to hump as well. I

672
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:55,740
Just want to get the oh, no, don't don't go looking

673
00:32:56,420 --> 00:33:00,580
Get humping. That's right. Exactly. Mm-hmm get humping because these birds need hump as well

674
00:33:01,820 --> 00:33:06,500
But thank you Zarian and Kaidon. Oh, we got it 24 hour

675
00:33:13,460 --> 00:33:18,740
What about banjo kazooie nuts and bolts, I don't think I've played that one. Do you want me to play it?

676
00:33:18,740 --> 00:33:20,740
I don't mind playing your childhood games

677
00:33:21,620 --> 00:33:30,140
If they're named after sweet treats, why aren't any of them named after shawnee am I a sweet treat any sweet treaters

678
00:33:32,140 --> 00:33:37,140
Actually, you're the sweet treat. I feel like your tentacles would taste a wee bit sweet

679
00:33:37,900 --> 00:33:42,140
Like sweet like caramel, you know how it's like salted caramel is like sweet and salty

680
00:33:42,140 --> 00:33:46,500
I feel like that's what your tentacle would taste like shawnee talking to two worms. Thank you

681
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:48,500
Oh

682
00:33:48,660 --> 00:33:52,460
My god, it's so cute. Oh, he's oh he tweaking. Oh

683
00:33:53,340 --> 00:33:58,580
My god, it's so tiny and cute and adorable. I love it so much

684
00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:04,460
I don't want it to get bigger, but it's about to change into an adult worm. Oh

685
00:34:05,660 --> 00:34:08,300
It's okay, right. I'm gonna have to pop that there

686
00:34:10,140 --> 00:34:15,620
I do need to order order and I don't have access to town yet

687
00:34:15,620 --> 00:34:17,620
But we can make a label to show

688
00:34:18,420 --> 00:34:21,020
What recently? Oh, I did not mean to do that. Oh

689
00:34:21,820 --> 00:34:23,420
this is

690
00:34:23,420 --> 00:34:27,340
Why not this can't be right? I'm orange and green

691
00:34:27,820 --> 00:34:31,980
Maybe for the border we do white and black just to make it simple right now

692
00:34:33,820 --> 00:34:38,020
So this label maker means that any pinata that is born in

693
00:34:39,340 --> 00:34:40,980
our

694
00:34:40,980 --> 00:34:46,180
Garden will will be branded like this. Okay, we're doing to hypnosis

695
00:34:46,180 --> 00:34:51,780
So we're gonna maybe I do my seashells like a pink and a lighter. Can I green maybe?

696
00:34:52,380 --> 00:34:55,860
Yes, and then for the symbol

697
00:34:56,940 --> 00:34:58,940
What should the symbol be?

698
00:35:00,900 --> 00:35:07,520
It's just an Xbox controller the Sun my seashells, okay, and then we'll do a purple

699
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:09,880
a

700
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:12,160
Purple and what?

701
00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:15,120
Maybe a light blue

702
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:18,120
Yeah

703
00:35:18,120 --> 00:35:20,640
Now you're getting branded. Okay, there we go. Oh

704
00:35:21,120 --> 00:35:22,880
We got it cheap it

705
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:28,280
Label designer. Oh, yeah, so now any baby that's born in the garden will have this. Oh

706
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:34,920
My god, look at sweet wings. You're so cute. Yeah, he wants a light in the garden

707
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:39,280
But we haven't unlocked anything yet that would do that. Oh, he's again. I'll go now. Oh

708
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:45,440
My god, how did you find the perfect symbol we guys? I don't know but if my if I'm correct

709
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:49,920
This one will hatch with the label on its boots

710
00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:55,520
Unless this one. Oh, no, look there you go. You can see a little bit on his leg like our left

711
00:35:56,040 --> 00:35:58,240
You can see the symbol on them

712
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:04,680
Well, he doesn't have it because he wasn't he was born a little too quick, but he'll have it

713
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:09,920
Although it's really tiny though. There you can see it. Can you see it? It's like a pixel on the screen. Oh, you're blocking it

714
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:12,440
That tiny. Oh, you're still blocking

715
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:18,880
I'd say strong he would be a mix of a sweet and sour flavor

716
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:24,000
Savory with an unexpected kick that catches you off guard. I want to find out

They need to have a house so they can pump pump inside it. You still need to a shag pad for the birds

740
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:00,760

You look wormling and squirming are fine, but they had to be sacrificed. It's a dog eat dog world

748
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:39,700
Look, I'm asked you this. You ever you ever seen a healthy looking vegan exactly

00:40:01,720 --> 00:40:06,700
He has a seat sparkling on his head. I never really paid attention to the designs, but they're very cute

755
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:14,920
Vegans randomly catching strays. I'm sorry, but it's a it's a meat eat meat kind of world jumps in

756
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:17,800
caveman eat meat world

757
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:24,760
Actually, you know what I'm gonna say something that a that I did in my research and

758
00:40:25,080 --> 00:40:27,080
that

759
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:33,120
Did you know that the reason why like

760
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:40,400
Way back when when humans were still developing the reason why there was a big massive development ring was

761
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:43,680
because

762
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:51,240
Because because because caveman figured out how to cook meat and the nutrient density of cooked meat was insane

763
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:58,600
That it literally caused like the brains to develop bigger. So sorry, but I'll defend me ears to the death

764
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:01,200
I'm sorry

765
00:41:01,480 --> 00:41:05,000
Spear Seedos. Oh spare him spare him

766
00:41:05,720 --> 00:41:09,560
Okay, okay. I thought you said spear him. I was like a bit dramatic

767
00:41:10,360 --> 00:41:13,240
Brain expansion true and real I did hear that we cook me

768
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:14,720
yes, I

769
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:21,520
Just sorry, I had a family member that was vegan for a couple of years and she became so

770
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:25,120
Physically ill and then the moment she started eating

771
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:31,200
Like meat and eggs again. She literally looked so much better overnight like sorry

772
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:37,280
I've just and not to be nasty to anyone. Love your life how you want, but please understand

773
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:40,240
You're literally playing with your health doing that kind of stuff. Um

774
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:45,880
Like it's just please please be careful with your health, please

775
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:50,240
You only live once don't like don't malnutrition yourself

776
00:41:52,080 --> 00:41:59,640
Punish me in his place spare you mean spade you mean hit him with the spade so seeds come out of his pocket

777
00:41:59,640 --> 00:42:04,920
Is that what you're trying to type? I think that's what you're trying to say because if you hit him with a spade seats come

778
00:42:04,920 --> 00:42:07,680
Out his bag, but he scatters and red

779
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:09,960
aim

780
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:14,560
Red seeds and I don't want red season. Oh look at it. Look at my worm army. Honestly

781
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:17,400
No spare

782
00:42:17,880 --> 00:42:20,400
What do you mean spare him? I don't hurt him

783
00:42:21,160 --> 00:42:24,960
Don't hurt him. No, I'm not. I'm not gonna hurt him. Okay

784
00:42:26,080 --> 00:42:33,840
Don't panic. Don't panic. We play nice. We pick all the good dialogues and the nice dialogues and games. Don't worry. Don't worry

785
00:42:34,840 --> 00:42:36,840
Yeah, I don't hurt. Oh, yes

786
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:41,680
Assistant lawmines start to eat less meat because she wants to be healthier than have to get iron inject

787
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:47,480
Yeah, especially for women to become vegans and because of

788
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:51,720
You know the monthly red river and

789
00:42:52,600 --> 00:42:57,680
The population is like 50% borderline anemic or something like that. Oh

790
00:42:58,360 --> 00:43:00,360
We got a tough line

791
00:43:00,360 --> 00:43:02,360
I

792
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:05,520
Love this

793
00:43:07,840 --> 00:43:13,080
I'm gonna start singing people. Yeah, I'm gonna go to bed tonight, and I'm gonna see all these adorable little

794
00:43:13,640 --> 00:43:16,920
Pena's floating around in my head. Please come into

795
00:43:17,600 --> 00:43:25,000
We have a daisy. Look. He's admiring the daisy. You're he's just like me for real for real. Oh

796
00:43:26,200 --> 00:43:28,880
My god, we have a bark up. I love flowers

797
00:43:29,640 --> 00:43:34,800
Look at that book. Look at the detail on that thing. Let's get a little aerial view going

798
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:46,120
But the taffy we can set on fire yes, but for good reason we set him on fire, but not in a mean way

799
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:51,080
It's because some pinatas can undergo a transformation

800
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:54,960
Transformation central

801
00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:58,840
Okay, now if I can touch the two birds we will

802
00:43:59,840 --> 00:44:02,160
Land, okay, we've got one landed hold

803
00:44:03,160 --> 00:44:08,000
Okay, okay, hold don't go inside. Don't go inside or stand on anything

804
00:44:08,680 --> 00:44:14,800
Okay, now both of you kiss right now in front of me. Oh wait, the shop is open. Hi Lottie

00:45:38,240 --> 00:45:41,920
Can you teach us about the pinata birds and bees real true?

821
00:45:42,880 --> 00:45:45,480
Okay, we're gonna purr pause fully

822

826
00:46:12,680 --> 00:46:14,680
Okay, we just need to squirt the pants

827
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:23,760
Squirt the plants three times and then we get an achievement once they're fully grown. Sorry my brain short-circuited there

828
00:46:24,040 --> 00:46:31,320
Okay, next we're gonna do the buttercup seeds because I think if I have six flowers we can unlock a honeycomb

829
00:46:31,880 --> 00:46:34,480
So we're just gonna start a little plant thing over here

830
00:46:35,960 --> 00:46:39,040
Okay, they're all getting planted and then we're gonna do Daisy's

831
00:46:41,840 --> 00:46:44,600
And just like that we have big garden of plants

832
00:46:45,720 --> 00:46:47,720

00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:50,800
Baby come back

834
00:46:55,200 --> 00:46:57,200
Once I've done my

835
00:46:58,160 --> 00:47:04,200
Last like ASMR recording I need to do I need to record the last script for patreon. I need to edit the script

836
00:47:04,200 --> 00:47:06,200
I've left it

837
00:47:07,520 --> 00:47:09,520
Okay, well not a buzzle

838
00:47:10,520 --> 00:47:15,600
Yes, God you guys are such big you guys are the smartest when it comes to this game

839
00:47:16,640 --> 00:47:22,720
I'm literally I feel so loved that we get to play a childhood games together like

840
00:47:24,720 --> 00:47:32,360
I can't I can't articulate my words. I can't handle it. It's too much. I'm not gonna make it

841
00:47:32,600 --> 00:47:34,600
It's too much

842
00:47:34,960 --> 00:47:36,960
What's so good

843
00:47:41,200 --> 00:47:46,440
Okay, the birds are humping now shiny freaky it's just I'm like so happy like

844
00:47:47,240 --> 00:47:53,360
Bruh, I can't like I always come back to this conversation of like all vtubers are like trying to try hard and like play a meta game

845
00:47:53,360 --> 00:47:59,120
I'm like fuck that shit. We're getting gamer score in a childhood game, and you guys actually like it. I

846
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:03,640
Know it's 4 a.m. But I'm so happy

847
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:07,000
I'm

848
00:48:11,160 --> 00:48:13,920
Right we're getting awards for growing stuff now

849
00:48:14,680 --> 00:48:20,840
So we've unlocked because we leveled up actually, you know what's something important we need to buy this

850
00:48:22,480 --> 00:48:25,040
Because it means we can get a

851
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:33,600
Cough drop moth drop as well as when we level up we unlock new seats and new fertilizer

852
00:48:33,920 --> 00:48:39,000
Okay, well we didn't unlock a new seat that time, but we did unlock a new fertilizer and the color is

853
00:48:39,800 --> 00:48:45,520
Purple so we're going to plant a turnip seed and then we're gonna spray the purple fertilizer on it

854
00:48:45,520 --> 00:48:48,600
and then we get an accolade for

855
00:48:49,840 --> 00:48:57,520
Using the fertilizer against the plant as long as you do it three times against any plant you get extra points and accolades for it

856
00:48:57,520 --> 00:49:01,000
Okay, and that's another way you can level up faster because the more you level up

857
00:49:01,840 --> 00:49:05,080
Like you can actually see it get bigger as well when you use the fertilizer

858
00:49:05,080 --> 00:49:09,400
But you can only do it three times, but you normally have a visual indication

859
00:49:09,400 --> 00:49:12,400
So you see how this turnip has three leaves now and

860
00:49:15,160 --> 00:49:20,360
My name is Jardinero you've probably heard of me and if you haven't okay, this is Lord

861
00:49:23,920 --> 00:49:28,920
Even after all this time, there's no one as good as I okay, so this is lower, okay

862
00:49:29,760 --> 00:49:36,520
Used to be my he's like telling us that it was his old garden and have any pinata stay in the garden

863
00:49:36,840 --> 00:49:38,840
Well apart from one pinata

864
00:49:39,360 --> 00:49:47,720
Let's face it if I couldn't get one no one else could what pinata was it you've got a long way to go before you can even call

865
00:49:47,720 --> 00:49:49,480

867
00:49:57,600 --> 00:50:01,120
This was in the days when pinata only left the island by boat

868
00:50:01,640 --> 00:50:06,800

00:52:36,880 --> 00:52:40,880
Turn it into fertilizer. I dare you a double-dog dare you

895
00:52:44,600 --> 00:52:48,400
No, he can't he can only do it on fruit. Okay, well guess what you're doing next

896
00:52:49,120 --> 00:52:51,400
You're becoming a red hot

897
00:52:52,480 --> 00:52:56,480
So you unfortunately you have to tell it to burn itself, which is really

898
00:52:58,320 --> 00:53:00,600
No fly through it

899
00:53:01,280 --> 00:53:09,200
Okay, uh-huh, uh-huh. Oh, yeah, uh-huh. Yeah, huh. No, let's go

900
00:53:10,600 --> 00:53:12,200

Know we have a super money money money

902
00:53:15,960 --> 00:53:17,960
Yeah

903
00:53:18,480 --> 00:53:20,480
Me me it's me

I'm a clever gardener. It's me. I'm a clever. I'm the cleverest gardener. Oh, oh

905
00:53:26,960 --> 00:53:30,200
No, no see this is an example

906
00:53:30,720 --> 00:53:38,840
Not everyone is bad. They're just misunderstood. Okay, so this is a sour shelly bean. Okay, and he eats seeds in the garden

907
00:53:41,080 --> 00:53:43,080
Don't be so judgmental leaf off

00:53:48,200 --> 00:53:51,200
We can fix them a spin yeah, real oh

909
00:53:51,680 --> 00:53:56,440
We look her shovels getting upgraded now as well. See our trouble gets stronger

910
00:53:57,440 --> 00:54:00,960
What Ryan I'm glad you and the rest of the lure exist

911
00:54:00,960 --> 00:54:04,080
I wish I could find people like you in my life

912
00:54:04,120 --> 00:54:09,720
But are they content watching you from behind my computer screen a bit of sweet feeling

913
00:54:10,080 --> 00:54:11,840
It's hard to find

914
00:54:11,840 --> 00:54:16,440
People like us in real life because people like us are on the internet. You know what I mean?

915
00:54:16,440 --> 00:54:22,440
I don't go outside. I have stinky be all from two days well from yesterday's stream

916
00:54:22,440 --> 00:54:25,880
I have stinky be all I smell like wet onions right now

917
00:54:27,200 --> 00:54:33,960
Thank you for the tip anonymous. I appreciate it. But if you want the truth people like us don't go outside

918
00:54:35,240 --> 00:54:41,440
It's true. I don't go outside. That's why you can't me as because we ain't no say

919
00:54:42,600 --> 00:54:44,360
you know

920
00:54:44,360 --> 00:54:49,440
That's why when it's that's why it's a big deal if a v2 bar

921
00:54:49,440 --> 00:54:54,200
I can't choose a favorite seed. They are all special to me

922
00:54:56,440 --> 00:54:58,600
My favorite seeds is reefing seeds. Thank you

923
00:55:00,280 --> 00:55:03,720
It was so obvious. I'm sorry. That was so oh he gave me corn

924
00:55:04,440 --> 00:55:09,640
It's corn a big lump of juice. Wait. No, that's not it has the juice

925
00:55:13,480 --> 00:55:15,480
Sir that's schizophrenia

926
00:55:15,720 --> 00:55:21,720
Sir, are you diagnosed? Do you need a little help? But I'm glad you enjoy the be all our girls. I'm sorry

927
00:55:22,760 --> 00:55:24,760

928
00:55:24,760 --> 00:55:27,720
That it's hard to find people that are just be chinning

929
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:33,640
It's hard like in real life socialization is not like ah legit then you go outside

930
00:55:35,080 --> 00:55:37,080
Oh, no, no, no, don't wait

931
00:55:38,600 --> 00:55:43,560
Okay, we're gonna overwater these plants on purpose. Okay. This is a tactic

932
00:55:43,640 --> 00:55:47,720
So you don't actually have to water it at any stage. Does that make sense?

933
00:55:48,920 --> 00:55:50,920
Oh

934
00:55:51,480 --> 00:55:55,160
Okay, okay. Okay. We have a sir. Shelly bean everyone stay calm stay calm

935
00:55:56,760 --> 00:56:01,480
We need to get the seed for him and then and then he'll be a good boy. Okay. See oh, there is

936
00:56:03,080 --> 00:56:06,200
Okay, so if you have a sir or shelly bean don't panic place

00:56:06,600 --> 00:56:12,200
A seed in front of him. Okay. I've given him a jelly bean seeds. Sorry. I've given him an apple tree seed

938
00:56:12,200 --> 00:56:14,440
Okay, turn around the seed is behind you

939
00:56:15,080 --> 00:56:17,080
stop it

940
00:56:17,080 --> 00:56:19,080
You're upsetting me

941
00:56:19,800 --> 00:56:21,800
Come back mister

942
00:56:22,440 --> 00:56:24,440

943
00:56:24,600 --> 00:56:26,440
Sam what do you want?

944
00:56:26,440 --> 00:56:29,000

Fertilizer for the corn please turn. Yes. Look look his ai turned him around to the seed. Oh, he's got such a good boy

946
00:56:38,040 --> 00:56:40,040
He's gonna be the goodest boy ever

947
00:56:41,160 --> 00:56:47,960
Okay, we're gonna buy a buttercup and then we're gonna level it up fully by putting three fertilizer

948
00:56:49,160 --> 00:56:51,880
Our daisy yellow as well. I think they might be

949
00:56:53,720 --> 00:56:59,480
Okay, we're gonna do that and then we're gonna oh, he just ate it. See he's becoming a good boy

950
00:57:00,520 --> 00:57:03,880
That's the thing you can do bad things in the past, but

951
00:57:04,840 --> 00:57:09,960
Sometimes, you know, you're a product of your environment and sometimes you didn't know better

952
00:57:09,960 --> 00:57:14,440
But now you know better and you can always change don't be so harsh on yourself. I think you can't change

953
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:20,760
What are you teaching morality through a video game about pinatas? Yes, and I wholeheartedly believe it

954
00:57:21,960 --> 00:57:27,000
Okay, you're never gonna go through life not making mistakes. Don't be so harsh on yourself

955
00:57:27,960 --> 00:57:29,960
Okay

956
00:57:30,440 --> 00:57:32,440
Okay

957
00:57:32,760 --> 00:57:39,960
Okay, right some spectrums. How can we send seeds so you plant them? I cannot plant what you would send me in a vial

958
00:57:40,040 --> 00:57:41,880
I assure you

959
00:57:41,880 --> 00:57:47,880
I cannot I cannot make anything grow from it. Although I did see that meme post where someone grew a mushroom on his

960
00:57:48,840 --> 00:57:50,840
Rag, if you will

961
00:57:52,600 --> 00:57:56,520
Thank you for the membership tier. Sorry. I assume that's how I'm supposed to announce you

962
00:57:57,880 --> 00:58:01,080
I'm getting me mallet. So no ink tree for it. I mean

963
00:58:02,680 --> 00:58:04,680
You could make something grow from it

964
00:58:05,720 --> 00:58:07,240
I thought

965
00:58:07,240 --> 00:58:11,160
Samples die within like five hours or something if it's outside the womb

966
00:58:11,240 --> 00:58:15,000
It can last for five days inside the womb but outside the womb and go make it

967
00:58:15,800 --> 00:58:17,800
And go make a chief

968
00:58:19,240 --> 00:58:21,240
Strud I didn't know you were in this game

969
00:58:24,200 --> 00:58:28,440
Oh great some spectrums kind of looks like me and we got a green fingers achievement

970
00:58:29,640 --> 00:58:32,760
A raisant. Okay, we've leveled up again

971
00:58:32,920 --> 00:58:34,920

00:58:36,440 --> 00:58:40,360
Most feature we're confirmed for gen 2 because this is so adorable. Look at me tail

973
00:58:42,200 --> 00:58:44,360
That'll be her a little voice lane as well. She goes

974
00:58:50,600 --> 00:58:55,160
Oh my god, I'm getting tail upgrade. I can't handle this. I can't handle this, please

975
00:58:55,960 --> 00:58:59,400
They're so cute. Oh, right. What's your tail upgrade? Are we a good gardener now?

976
00:59:00,200 --> 00:59:02,200
Oh

977
00:59:04,280 --> 00:59:06,120
We're experienced

978
00:59:06,120 --> 00:59:08,120
Flames, I do like

979
00:59:09,240 --> 00:59:11,240
Oh

980
00:59:11,320 --> 00:59:17,640
Oh, you get a little achievement. You've earned three achievements. They literally give you like a little achievement thing

981
00:59:19,720 --> 00:59:22,280
I just have a lot of great juice. We leveled up

982
00:59:23,080 --> 00:59:24,920
Don't mind if I do

983
00:59:24,920 --> 00:59:26,920
Most train conductor

984
00:59:27,240 --> 00:59:30,760
Stop that's actually such a good idea. I like that. I'm going to thank you

985
00:59:32,120 --> 00:59:34,120
This garden is still very amateur

986
00:59:39,960 --> 00:59:41,960
Oh, sorry

987
00:59:42,680 --> 00:59:46,440
I was stretching again. Oh, so we stood her

988
00:59:46,440 --> 00:59:48,440
We

989
00:59:53,160 --> 01:00:01,800
We're speedrunning gen 3 confirmed stop real true. Okay, this is the summer pinata changing

990
01:00:07,080 --> 01:00:12,760
We tend okay, this is what I mean about the notifications at the start of the game

991
01:00:13,880 --> 01:00:15,080
It is

992
01:00:15,160 --> 01:00:17,160
Unending

993
01:00:18,840 --> 01:00:20,840
Can't play the game

994
01:00:21,160 --> 01:00:23,160
It's just cutscene after cutscene

995
01:00:24,760 --> 01:00:26,040
Oh

996
01:00:26,040 --> 01:00:29,400
Better shovel for the spanking. She likes running trains

997
01:00:30,520 --> 01:00:31,960
Oh

998
01:00:31,960 --> 01:00:33,960
I might submit that

999
01:00:34,360 --> 01:00:38,600
I really like that mouse train conductor and her catchphrase

1000
01:00:38,600 --> 01:00:40,600
Choo choo

1001
01:00:40,840 --> 01:00:43,080
Oh, it'd have to be a lollipop though

1002
01:00:43,960 --> 01:00:47,800
Can you have a milf train conductor mouse because then it would be like choo choo

1003
01:00:50,040 --> 01:00:54,280
Oh, I like the way it touches its wee belly in that cutscene. He's like, yep

1004
01:00:55,240 --> 01:01:03,480
It gives me old grandpa vibe. Okay. Okay. Let's stop with the notifications. Let's play the game

1005
01:01:04,440 --> 01:01:06,440
Oh

1006
01:01:08,040 --> 01:01:10,360
I may have girl bossed this game a little too hard

1007
01:01:11,080 --> 01:01:16,040
How long is this interruption? Please are you gonna hundred percent this game on stream? Um

1008
01:01:17,080 --> 01:01:19,080
There's one achievement that

1009
01:01:19,560 --> 01:01:21,560
Might not be able to be on stream

1010
01:01:22,280 --> 01:01:24,920
Which is played for 24 in-game hours

1011
01:01:24,920 --> 01:01:30,760
I think and I would have to do it offline because you have to go into the shop in order to

1012
01:01:31,400 --> 01:01:33,400
aim

1013
01:01:33,640 --> 01:01:35,880
Okay, right no more

1014
01:01:38,280 --> 01:01:40,280
Thank you

1015
01:01:40,680 --> 01:01:43,480
Okay, thank you. Thank you. I just

1016
01:01:44,360 --> 01:01:45,880
I just

1017
01:01:45,880 --> 01:01:47,880
need some

1018
01:01:49,800 --> 01:01:51,480
Sometime

1019
01:01:51,480 --> 01:01:53,480
Oh, no, I only have 34 coins

1020
01:01:54,520 --> 01:01:56,520
I can't afford any of this

1021
01:01:57,880 --> 01:01:59,240
I haven't

1022
01:01:59,320 --> 01:02:08,040
30 for one pump 18 for one pump. All right. I'm gonna have to start. I'm gonna plant fruit so we can sell it

1023
01:02:09,240 --> 01:02:11,240
uh

1024
01:02:12,200 --> 01:02:16,920
I guess corn makes us like 30. I'm just gonna grow corn and then sell it

1025
01:02:18,440 --> 01:02:25,880
With my my I have no money. I have five four corns to sell. That's the best I can do

1026
01:02:26,520 --> 01:02:28,520
Oh

1027
01:02:29,080 --> 01:02:31,080
We have a bunny

1028
01:02:31,720 --> 01:02:36,280
No, I'm not gonna name this bunny she be because I already know what his fate is gonna be

1029
01:02:36,840 --> 01:02:44,120
Uh, there's gonna be a pretz tail that shows up and perishes it. Okay, so just uh, let me let me kick

1030
01:02:44,200 --> 01:02:46,200
Okay, let me just zoom out by

1031
01:02:47,400 --> 01:02:53,080
Oh my god, we have a butterfly in the garden too. Oh everything's coming up has eaten three chilies

1032
01:02:53,080 --> 01:02:58,280
I'm not even unlocked a chili. Uh, yeah, bam, right. I'm gonna make another one of these

1033
01:03:00,760 --> 01:03:04,600
Uh, I'm gonna make another taff like uh, no, sorry

1034
01:03:07,400 --> 01:03:09,080
Please

1035
01:03:09,080 --> 01:03:12,840
Please let me play the game. Please cut scenes. Please

1036
01:03:14,520 --> 01:03:16,520
Stop this madness

1037
01:03:17,640 --> 01:03:21,480
Do the next one. Yeah, I'm gonna unlock the pretz tail and then I'm gonna leave it

1038
01:03:22,040 --> 01:03:25,960
Okay, we have no flow. Go. I played this game so much on the egg flick. Yeah

1039
01:03:27,240 --> 01:03:32,200
Oh, right. So as a Scottish family when my dad saw this character

1040
01:03:32,920 --> 01:03:38,360
He started laughing and I was like, why why are you laughing dad? I don't get it

1041
01:03:39,080 --> 01:03:43,000
So this is just multiplayer if you want to send stuff to people you can

1042
01:03:43,880 --> 01:03:48,680
Yeah, literally as a Scottish family. I was like dad dad. Why are you laughing? I don't get it. What's so funny?

1043
01:03:48,680 --> 01:03:50,680
What's so funny and he's like

1044
01:03:52,280 --> 01:03:55,720
Like he doesn't want to tell me because I was too young at the time

1045
01:03:57,160 --> 01:04:02,040
But uh, yeah, okay, so we're gonna sell some corn

1046
01:04:03,160 --> 01:04:06,440
Uh, we also got a bunny rabbit so we can sell that

1047
01:04:08,120 --> 01:04:13,320
Um, our little shelly bean we could maybe sell because I don't really do anything with them

1048
01:04:14,520 --> 01:04:16,520
I don't know

1049
01:04:16,520 --> 01:04:20,280
I like the crow. We unlock, um a crow later on

1050
01:04:21,080 --> 01:04:26,600
So I think I'll do that. You have a mouse malo. Oh, what does the mouse malo need to level up?

1051
01:04:28,840 --> 01:04:33,480
Oh, we can maybe quickly put fertilizer on this plant if we didn't run out of time

1052
01:04:34,360 --> 01:04:36,360
We might have just run out of time though

1053
01:04:38,920 --> 01:04:40,920
Turnips I believe more like no

1054
01:04:41,640 --> 01:04:44,120
You know this could start to get annoying

1055
01:04:46,440 --> 01:04:54,280
We just ran out of time and no more. Oh, we can do water already. Right. We're gonna plant an apple tree

1056
01:04:55,960 --> 01:04:58,280
Something just popped. I think it was the corn

1057
01:04:59,400 --> 01:05:01,400
Oh, it sounds like popcorn. I get it now

1058
01:05:02,520 --> 01:05:09,080
Do you need your garden? Oh, please. I know my garden's improving. I'm just mlg. Okay. I'm just mlg. You don't have to tell me

1059
01:05:09,080 --> 01:05:11,720
I'm just so good. Okay, right. We're gonna sell the corn

1060
01:05:12,440 --> 01:05:17,960
For some money. Okay. That was a good investment. I think we paid like 20 and made 100 on that. Sounds good

1061
01:05:22,200 --> 01:05:26,920
I just got the funny joke. I'm stupid. Yeah, well apparently it means but for americans

1062
01:05:27,720 --> 01:05:29,160
but

1063
01:05:29,160 --> 01:05:32,360
For the british people. It means uh, hooha

1064
01:05:33,240 --> 01:05:34,920
right, we

1065
01:05:34,920 --> 01:05:36,360
are

1066
01:05:36,360 --> 01:05:42,200
Your friends you will never be alone again. So come on

1067
01:05:43,640 --> 01:05:45,240
Come on

1068
01:05:45,240 --> 01:05:49,960
Right, so we're gonna purposefully overwater the f out of this tree. So I don't have to do it

1069
01:05:50,680 --> 01:05:53,960
Uh, I'm gonna sell them. No, I'm not because we're gonna get a serpent

1070
01:05:56,440 --> 01:05:59,560
Leaf us, please. I know I'm mlg at this game

1071
01:06:00,040 --> 01:06:01,800
Better

1072
01:06:01,800 --> 01:06:07,160
So did you do it? If you feed a sparrowman a certain flower, it'll change the color. Yes. I'm going to get

1073
01:06:08,280 --> 01:06:15,240
Full sparrowman. Oh my god. He's humping the plant. I love him. Look at his wee arms. Oh my god. I love him

1074
01:06:17,080 --> 01:06:21,080
That's uh, oh no, don't push him away. He was chilling on that farm

1075
01:06:22,840 --> 01:06:24,840
He was bing-chinging

1076
01:06:25,720 --> 01:06:33,000
Oh, we have a honeybee sweet little honeybee. I know what you want from me. It's six but

01:06:33,720 --> 01:06:41,160
It's six bar sco- uh bar cups in the garden six bar cups in the garden sweet little bumblebee

1078
01:06:42,520 --> 01:06:44,520
I know it's a fantasy

1079
01:06:46,840 --> 01:06:48,840
It's already been an hour

1080
01:06:50,200 --> 01:06:53,000
I just clocked it it's 5 a.m. I'm like it's already been an hour

1081
01:06:55,640 --> 01:06:57,640
Oh

Into the fire and we're gonna get an award for master romancer. You do not actually have to romance them

01:07:11,720 --> 01:07:17,480
It has in fact been 60 minutes already. How do you this endurance stream isn't even gonna be endurance?

1086
01:07:17,480 --> 01:07:21,240
I'm going I'm saying it right now. It's not endurance because I'm having far too much fun

1087
01:07:22,040 --> 01:07:23,080

01:07:46,920 --> 01:07:48,920
Oh

1095
01:07:49,480 --> 01:07:53,480

Yeah cough medicine. Yeah, I knew I remembered. Okay. Now we're gonna make everything a flutter scotch

Are you squidding me right now? Anonymous. Hey strone. Hello. Hope you're doing well today. I'm poor good

I'd give you read the marshmallow I sent last night

1108
01:09:01,800 --> 01:09:06,600
But part of your eye and smile are all laps left burned on my tv screen

1109
01:09:07,080 --> 01:09:09,960
Have a great stream mom. Oh, you want me to read it?

1110

I'm gonna I'm gonna prank the fuck out of this watercress seed by giving it all the nutrition

1112
01:09:23,320 --> 01:09:29,880
We have not unlocked the green fertilizer. I have been pranked. Okay. We can at least fertilize the apple tree

1113
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:33,000
Okay, you ready?

1114
01:09:33,720 --> 01:09:42,680
Okay, unfortunately that pretzel is coming. Oh, it's raining. Wait when it rains in the game. Um, it's

1115
01:09:49,400 --> 01:09:52,040
That's actually me trying to formulate a sentence out loud

1116
01:09:53,400 --> 01:09:58,840
Hi, you know, there are some people like myself who can help you with your more mundane tasks

1117
01:09:59,400 --> 01:10:03,560
Man, thank you. You should let a sprinkling like me come water your plants for you

1118
01:10:03,880 --> 01:10:06,440
I'm sure there's an initial fee, but I'm worth it

1119
01:10:06,920 --> 01:10:10,360
You can find me an arpher's in here if you want to take me up on the offer

1120
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:15,000
No doubt some of my friends will be turning up too. Some of my friends will be turning up

1121
01:10:17,880 --> 01:10:23,640
I love shebe's valley accent so much someone says I need to see strone in a dress a dress

1122
01:10:23,800 --> 01:10:29,800
I don't wear dresses. Do you mean like show a picture of me in a dress? I could order a dress for you

1123
01:10:30,120 --> 01:10:33,160
If it would make you happy to see me, then I'll do it for you

1124
01:10:34,760 --> 01:10:40,920
I wish I had a canine tentacle so I could not you well, I don't think that was the the the one I was supposed to read

1125
01:10:41,400 --> 01:10:42,920
um

1126
01:10:42,920 --> 01:10:47,080
Gonna be honest. I don't think that was the one I was supposed to read out loud. Um,

1127
01:10:47,800 --> 01:10:51,320
Sonny and sonny strone in a sundress would be p

1128
01:10:52,040 --> 01:10:53,560
um

1129
01:10:54,520 --> 01:10:59,160
Hey strone, I recently started watching you and all the veal or girls. Thank you for supporting my gen mates

1130
01:10:59,160 --> 01:11:03,320
Please do check them out if you haven't had a chance yet, and I wanted to say you're all amazing

1131
01:11:03,400 --> 01:11:06,040
I'm mostly a lurker and listen to streams while I'm at work

1132
01:11:06,280 --> 01:11:11,880
I actually probably never would have used marshmallows, but something funny happened and I thought you might get a chuckle out of it

1133
01:11:12,280 --> 01:11:20,040
So I use the fairly old tv as my computer monitor because um, oh rain cloud. Thank you for the redirect

1134
01:11:20,760 --> 01:11:26,840
Uh, hello rain cloud. We're playing viva pinata, but I'm currently right reading a marshmallow very quickly. Um

1135
01:11:27,560 --> 01:11:33,000
So I use a fairly old tv as my computer monitor because youtube is my cable at this point real true

1136
01:11:33,160 --> 01:11:38,680
Did you know that in the younger generation hardly anyone has cable because no one gives a fuck about the tv has to say

1137
01:11:39,160 --> 01:11:40,200
Um

1138
01:11:40,200 --> 01:11:46,360
And imagine paying for it. Um, have a fun stream. Yes, please relax after your stream. Thank you so much. Hi raiders

1139
01:11:46,680 --> 01:11:51,800
Hi, I'm shawnee calls from gen ones feel or indulge and I'm playing viva pinata childhood game

1140
01:11:51,880 --> 01:11:53,080
And I'm really chaotic

1141
01:11:53,080 --> 01:11:57,240
So I'd really recommend checking out my gen mates instead if you if you want to continue the entertainment

1142
01:11:57,400 --> 01:11:59,080
I that kind of entertainer

1143
01:11:59,080 --> 01:12:02,600
She'd be caught in bum if you like girl failures and people who yap

1144
01:12:03,160 --> 01:12:05,160
As early I feel like the mummy vibes

1145
01:12:05,320 --> 01:12:09,560
Uh, uh, emmy if you want a little sister, uh, I see if you want a little daughter

And mercy if you like yandere's okay there. Okay. Got that out of the way. Thank you. Thank you very kind of

1147
01:12:15,640 --> 01:12:18,280
I kiss side kiss side chicky kisses

1148
01:12:19,240 --> 01:12:21,240
Hi, thank you

1149
01:12:23,320 --> 01:12:26,200
Well, I fell asleep to your ASMR last night when I woke up

1150
01:12:26,200 --> 01:12:29,480
I watched a few other videos while getting ready for work before I left

1151
01:12:29,800 --> 01:12:35,960
I went to check my discord and got jump-scared by my face burned into the background of the screen

1152
01:12:36,280 --> 01:12:39,560
Thank you for doing what you're doing best wishes for you and the girl. That's funny

1153
01:12:40,360 --> 01:12:43,400
My face burnt into your monitor screen. That's

1154
01:12:44,360 --> 01:12:46,360
Oh

1155
01:12:46,920 --> 01:12:48,520
Jump scare

1156
01:12:48,520 --> 01:12:55,160
This the but what happens if I'm not actually burned into your screen and the corruption's already happened real true

1157
01:12:56,520 --> 01:12:58,520
Arthur stout

1158
01:12:58,680 --> 01:13:03,080
Hello, Arthur stout get it because he's a water spout of milk

1159
01:13:04,120 --> 01:13:06,120
She beats our girl failure

1160
01:13:06,520 --> 01:13:08,440
Girl failure

1161
01:13:08,440 --> 01:13:15,000
Plug successfully plug. Okay. Good. Some of the veal or girls are rebranding from their previous channels right now. I recognize another

1162
01:13:15,720 --> 01:13:17,720
em

1163
01:13:18,680 --> 01:13:22,120
I have terrible absolutely horrific news. Um

1164
01:13:23,160 --> 01:13:28,840
But gen one veal or is not made up of people that I've never streamed before it's very unlikely any agency does that

1165
01:13:29,800 --> 01:13:35,400
I'ma just warn you right now. Oh, no the bunny. Well, that's why we didn't need this is literally why we didn't name it

1166
01:13:35,400 --> 01:13:38,600
Shibi because the fox beats it up without fail. What's this?

1167
01:13:40,120 --> 01:13:42,120
Oh, we can put um

1168
01:13:43,960 --> 01:13:47,080
We can put orange on this orange fertilizer

1169
01:13:47,560 --> 01:13:53,400
Hi, it's Johnny doing good today. Yeah, we're playing childhood game and I'm going great. I'm going fair

1170
01:13:54,680 --> 01:13:55,960
Because I love it

1171
01:13:55,960 --> 01:13:56,680
um

1172
01:13:56,680 --> 01:13:58,120
So the reason

1173
01:13:58,120 --> 01:14:03,640
I've said it before but the reason why we put fertilizer is because we get six extra points like on the pedal wheel

1174
01:14:04,120 --> 01:14:06,680
For doing this and the pump can get big

1175
01:14:08,600 --> 01:14:12,600
And then we're going to try and do it with everything rip the bunny

1176
01:14:13,080 --> 01:14:15,080
Yeah, literally rip the oh

1177
01:14:15,160 --> 01:14:17,160
We've overworked the f out of this

1178
01:14:17,880 --> 01:14:19,880
But once it's growing

1179
01:14:20,840 --> 01:14:24,040
Although it looks very small right now. I think I might need to dig this a bit bigger

1180
01:14:25,480 --> 01:14:29,880
Sometimes the game's a wee bit funny. Oh my the game called me a what?

1181
01:14:31,080 --> 01:14:33,080
A whore

1182
01:14:34,120 --> 01:14:36,120
Horticultural horticulturist

1183
01:14:38,280 --> 01:14:42,200
Horticulturist, I don't know how to say that word. It's got a t in it. Okay

1184
01:14:42,840 --> 01:14:47,480
It's got a t in it the gate is the word's got a t in it. So I don't know what how to do

1185
01:14:48,760 --> 01:14:52,600
At least it's accurate a horticulturist. Yeah, okay that word

1186
01:14:54,200 --> 01:14:57,480
I know he's wee bum. He lost his wee bum tail

1187
01:14:59,240 --> 01:15:01,240
And we got fox too

1188
01:15:04,600 --> 01:15:07,640
Who told the game about strunny psychic real true

1189
01:15:08,840 --> 01:15:11,160
4k oh the pumpkin's being made

1190
01:15:12,440 --> 01:15:17,640
Look at him. That is that is a pumpkin. How much do you sell for 240?

1191
01:15:18,680 --> 01:15:20,680
Uh, I'm gonna sell it

1192
01:15:21,160 --> 01:15:25,000
Award for growing a pumpkin. Yeah, but give me the award for overgrowing it

1193
01:15:25,400 --> 01:15:29,000
Right, so we are going to sell the moth drop because it's an income source

1194
01:15:29,080 --> 01:15:33,080
They will constantly come back into the garden and it's really good for us

1195
01:15:33,800 --> 01:15:37,880
Um, a snake hasn't come in and eaten. Oh, it's miss petula

1196
01:15:39,320 --> 01:15:41,320
What a squashy large pumpkin honestly

1197
01:15:42,040 --> 01:15:47,720
Guess it's back to the pet shop for me then you should drop in by a pair. I used to grow drew. I mean

1198
01:15:48,360 --> 01:15:53,000
Poison plants in my garden to make money. Why yes, of course poison plants

1199
01:15:53,640 --> 01:15:59,320
Horticulturist affectionately. That's so good. Oh someone said that my marshmallow

1200
01:15:59,400 --> 01:16:04,280
They um, they were asking in marshmallow. They were asking us to play factorial

1201
01:16:05,320 --> 01:16:06,040
Factorio

1202
01:16:06,040 --> 01:16:07,000
um

1203
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:13,560
And they said you in the the whole and I was like, uh, excuse me. Where's the affectionate and in brackets

1204
01:16:13,960 --> 01:16:17,320
Okay, we've unlocked Bart. We are gonna tell Bart

1205
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:20,600
to

1206
01:16:20,600 --> 01:16:22,600
Make this honey

1207
01:16:23,080 --> 01:16:27,720
Into medicine. Okay, and excellent and because when we do that when the sherbet

1208
01:16:28,120 --> 01:16:31,000
Um, the naughty server pinata that we unlocked

1209
01:16:32,040 --> 01:16:35,800
When oh, we're just going to chief for buying something from a shop real

1210
01:16:37,080 --> 01:16:39,400
Is this what therapy shopping is?

1211
01:16:40,280 --> 01:16:41,640
um

1212
01:16:41,640 --> 01:16:44,280
I am literally playing factorial in the background

1213
01:16:44,840 --> 01:16:46,840
Hi Bartholomew

1214
01:16:47,960 --> 01:16:51,240
I'm gonna be honest because of simpsons. I didn't think Bart was a real name

1215
01:16:52,120 --> 01:16:55,000
I said what I said. I didn't I didn't think it was a real name. Okay

1216
01:16:55,720 --> 01:16:57,720
Um, we're gonna sell this pumpkin

1217
01:16:59,000 --> 01:17:03,080
And we're going to sell the puzzle gum from oh, no, I'm not because I renamed him. Um

1218
01:17:03,880 --> 01:17:08,840
Right it is raining. So we should take advantage of that if we can plant

1219
01:17:09,320 --> 01:17:16,520
Um chili seeds, but I don't think we've unlocked chili seeds. Yeah, which is a shame. No, we've got pumpkin and we've got a blackberry seed

1220
01:17:16,520 --> 01:17:17,880
Okay

1221
01:17:17,880 --> 01:17:19,720
We will plant

1222
01:17:19,720 --> 01:17:24,920
Excuse me. Uh, we will plant the blackberry seed and we're also going to plant the hazelnut seed because we unlocked

1223
01:17:25,320 --> 01:17:30,840
What's called a squazzle? I do not know why the squirrel is called a squazzle

1224
01:17:31,480 --> 01:17:33,080
I don't know what

1225
01:17:33,080 --> 01:17:35,160
item it's supposed to relate to

1226
01:17:36,040 --> 01:17:38,120
Um, did that tree just finish growing?

1227
01:17:39,720 --> 01:17:41,720
Not yet, but we are gonna

1228
01:17:42,360 --> 01:17:44,360
Give it some red fertilizer if you

1229
01:17:45,320 --> 01:17:47,320
Hello, how's it going? It's going

1230
01:17:47,640 --> 01:17:49,480
blogger

1231
01:17:49,480 --> 01:17:51,480
Ain't medicine for the crow. Oh

1232
01:17:55,560 --> 01:17:59,880
It's gonna bloom. Do you see that little thing that that bud right in right ahead right front and center?

1233
01:18:01,480 --> 01:18:07,400
I'm playing warframe, but this game is so much nostalgia. I really should poke my 360

1234
01:18:08,280 --> 01:18:12,680
You rarely play on pc. It's well worth the money if you are

1235
01:18:14,040 --> 01:18:16,280
Uh gamer like that. What do I need that?

1236
01:18:17,960 --> 01:18:19,960
Um

1237
01:18:20,120 --> 01:18:22,120
um

1238
01:18:22,360 --> 01:18:25,720
I'm gonna plant a blue bale and then I'll fully unlock it. How about that?

1239
01:18:27,320 --> 01:18:32,440
Oh, I need a pumpkin and I need bark to come back right hold on. I need a pumpkin. I remember

1240
01:18:33,560 --> 01:18:35,560

1241
01:18:35,880 --> 01:18:37,880
I need a pumpkin

1242
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:45,880
300 that's extortionate. You should be embarrassed to those prices. Sorry, but capitalism strikes again

1243
01:18:45,960 --> 01:18:49,160
You can't escape it. So it's 13 for the seeds

1244
01:18:50,120 --> 01:18:55,400
Right, I'm sorry, but oh no, that's too close. Sorry. I didn't realize it was there. Okay. We do have medicine

1245
01:18:55,400 --> 01:18:57,400
We're gonna call Bart out once that grows

1246
01:18:58,200 --> 01:19:01,480
A plan is stunted. No a plan is stunning

1247
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:05,000
The high table did this

1248
01:19:05,080 --> 01:19:11,800
Now you want to make me play something. I'm at in oh my god. I'm at am I an influencer?

1249
01:19:12,280 --> 01:19:16,680
Have I influenced you right? We're gonna make this blue bale fully upgraded

1250
01:19:16,760 --> 01:19:23,000
So it's gonna be gorgeous and stunning and so pretty and just like you riflin

1251
01:19:24,280 --> 01:19:27,000
He's you're my pretty little boy. Okay. We're gonna pop this

1252
01:19:28,120 --> 01:19:35,000
And then we're gonna get the white one to eat the blue one and then we're gonna get this new one to eat the red one

1253
01:19:36,840 --> 01:19:40,600
Hello, I know you've just got here. Please turn red for me

1261
01:20:06,600 --> 01:20:14,440
I've recorded my side, but I need to record the foley noises for the Poseidon one because there's actually new sound effects in it

1262
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:17,480
I oh we've extended the land

1263
01:20:19,240 --> 01:20:21,240
We've got more land

1264
01:20:21,560 --> 01:20:23,560
I'm so happy

1265
01:20:23,560 --> 01:20:26,360
Right, who's stunted growth. What can he be you you're growing

1266

Oh, you've got his he just got his freaking stinger stuck in the ground

1267
01:20:31,720 --> 01:20:35,560
I'm gonna sell the pretz tail because I don't do anything with someone bonked my afro

And now all this sweet sweet loving dropped all over the floor. Thank you for the 150. What the heck?

1269
01:20:43,480 --> 01:20:45,800
Thank you afro fluff. What why?

1270
01:20:47,960 --> 01:20:52,680
That's so much. That's so much. I didn't do anything. Wait, why is that not spanking it?

1271
01:20:53,960 --> 01:21:00,840
Okay, so if we check out the map that was you didn't want me to say or do anything Jesus. Thank you for the 150 tip

1272
01:21:00,840 --> 01:21:02,360
That's insane

1273
01:21:02,520 --> 01:21:04,920
Someone bonked my afro and now all my sweets are on the floor

1274
01:21:06,280 --> 01:21:11,480
Oh my god, thank you. Okay, we have extended the garden again. Do you see the perimeter?

1275
01:21:12,600 --> 01:21:15,400
Um, I assure you your money is not going to waste

1276
01:21:15,960 --> 01:21:21,720
It is going to the I don't need to do a donathon to confirm the genters and production fund. I assure you

1277
01:21:22,280 --> 01:21:24,280

And if you're watching and you're like, oh, it sucks that I can't give any money

1281
01:21:35,160 --> 01:21:37,000
You do not have to give me money

1282
01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:41,800
Even licking interacting lurking all of this helps me in the algorithm

1283
01:21:41,960 --> 01:21:45,400
Like please don't worry if you're like, I literally cannot handle our money

1284
01:21:45,800 --> 01:21:47,800
Surprise, you don't have to

1285
01:21:47,880 --> 01:21:54,360
The the reason why two of my ASMR videos went trending is because you guys liked it

1286
01:21:54,760 --> 01:21:58,840
And then the algorithm recommended it to people that haven't seen me before

1287
01:21:59,320 --> 01:22:01,800
And because you were liking it and interacting with it

1288
01:22:02,040 --> 01:22:10,200
It got trending and now unbelievably my first ASMR video on the freaking channel of please let me hold it

1293
01:22:31,320 --> 01:22:35,560
But if you wait, why is the pumpkin over there? Was it just a random pump?

1294
01:22:35,640 --> 01:22:39,480
Oh, maybe I like got thrown across the fence. That was quite a distance

1295
01:22:40,120 --> 01:22:44,840
I love the yapping ASMR too good because I have like another two that's already pre-recorded

1297
01:22:52,040 --> 01:22:53,240

01:23:17,400 --> 01:23:20,760

1310
01:23:42,920 --> 01:23:44,920

1311
01:23:44,920 --> 01:23:47,800
Story your kisses who's my soul that have nice kisses

bar in

1314
01:23:52,760 --> 01:23:54,760
So we're doing we're setting up in advance

1315
01:23:55,640 --> 01:24:00,120
So for when that server pinata comes in he needs to eat a jack o lantern

1316
01:24:00,280 --> 01:24:06,440
So bar is going to change this regular schmegular pumpkin into a jack o lantern

1317
01:24:07,000 --> 01:24:08,360
Oh

1318
01:24:08,360 --> 01:24:11,160
The apples are coming. Oh look

1319
01:24:12,360 --> 01:24:16,280
You see all those little green dots on the tree. They're gonna turn red into apples

1320
01:24:17,080 --> 01:24:23,640
Reflings we can make apple jam together on our farm. I love this game. I love it

1321
01:24:25,000 --> 01:24:27,000
I love everything about this game

1322
01:24:27,720 --> 01:24:32,760
It's the best game ever. I don't care what anyone says. Well, I'm biased. How dare you don't say such things

1323
01:24:33,480 --> 01:24:35,980
Oh, no, the poppy's about to die. Oh

1324
01:24:39,640 --> 01:24:43,800
We're gonna make it we made it we saved it from misery

1325
01:24:45,080 --> 01:24:50,520
Oh, I'm no overwarring it. Okay. That was a mistake on my part. Wait. Was I supposed to put red fertilizer on this one?

1326
01:24:50,600 --> 01:24:55,880
I knew extending the opening out on the payoff. Oh, we have a new seed. Oh, we have jelly seed

1327
01:24:57,160 --> 01:25:02,520
We've opened out a slamar wins. Uh, what would I what would I say? I don't even know what I would say

1328
01:25:03,080 --> 01:25:06,360
Good job on your garden

1329
01:25:07,560 --> 01:25:08,760
Your garden

1330
01:25:08,760 --> 01:25:09,560
Thanks

1331
01:25:09,560 --> 01:25:10,760
I don't know what I would say

1332
01:25:10,760 --> 01:25:16,600
Okay, so chili seeds when it rains it's good to plant chili seeds because you get 100 coins back per chili

1333
01:25:16,840 --> 01:25:21,080
And then if you use the fertilizer you get like 300 coins back

1334
01:25:21,640 --> 01:25:23,640
so it's pretty good

1335
01:25:24,120 --> 01:25:27,800
Strongly living and planning her retirement via viva pinata

01:25:29,560 --> 01:25:36,440
Bro the farm life of like growing my own produce and having chickens and then sharing it with the neighbors as well

1338
01:25:36,520 --> 01:25:38,520
Like I've seen

1339
01:25:39,720 --> 01:25:41,960
Anonymous Brian I'd rather jam your peach

1340
01:25:42,680 --> 01:25:49,880
Sorry, it was too easy. I get it. No, I'ma I'ma let that one. That was a good one. That was a good one

1341
01:25:50,760 --> 01:25:55,960
Yep. Yeah. Yep. Get brain rot. Get brain rot. Get brain rot

1342
01:25:56,120 --> 01:26:00,360
Yep. Yep. Yep. Get brain rot. Get brain rot. Get brain rot just by talking to me

1343
01:26:00,600 --> 01:26:03,960
Actually, I've made a funny request of emmy. I hope she does it

1344
01:26:04,680 --> 01:26:10,520
Well, I hope she has time to do because she's actually super busy right now. Um with her model

1345
01:26:10,680 --> 01:26:12,680
But she might be rigging it a lot

1346
01:26:12,840 --> 01:26:14,760
um

1347
01:26:14,760 --> 01:26:21,000
So I hope she's having a good time because I need to pester her about it very shortly. Um

1348
01:26:21,800 --> 01:26:26,600
Yeah, emmy cooking. She is she is cooking

1349
01:26:28,120 --> 01:26:33,880
Hey, thank you very much momolo for the super chat and anonymous for the jam

1350
01:26:34,280 --> 01:26:37,720
That was that I'll give you that was actually really good. I wouldn't have thought of that myself

1351
01:26:38,520 --> 01:26:43,000
And then again, most things don't occur to me, but that's a me problem. Not you problem, you know

1352
01:26:43,800 --> 01:26:45,800
Okay, we are gonna give it fertilizer

1353
01:26:47,960 --> 01:26:50,280
No, we're gonna go get fucked excuse me

1354
01:26:51,000 --> 01:26:53,000
Apparently the fertilizer wasn't it?

1355
01:26:55,480 --> 01:26:59,960
Okay, well it worked on the tree so sure. Oh

1356
01:27:01,880 --> 01:27:09,320
Oh, we leveled up again. Yay. Oh, so this is a gatherer. She'll pick up everything that from a garden and sell it

1357
01:27:12,120 --> 01:27:16,760
I do think she will she posted on twitter that she was done with it. Oh, that's fantastic

1358
01:27:16,840 --> 01:27:19,160
I didn't know that's the thing the only thing

1359
01:27:19,720 --> 01:27:25,880
I worry when being all these streams is I don't get to catch up until either after streams or I get really lucky

1360
01:27:26,120 --> 01:27:29,320
However, I have changed my sleep

1361
01:27:30,120 --> 01:27:36,520
So hopefully that means I will sell the second puzzle gum. They're literally 1000 which is insane

1362
01:27:37,080 --> 01:27:42,200
Um, oh the share bar. What do you need darlin? What do you need? Has he a jack-o-lantern?

1363
01:27:42,440 --> 01:27:47,320
You'll never guess what I have for you. I have something that you desire

1364
01:27:48,280 --> 01:27:50,280
I have something you desire look boom

1365
01:27:50,840 --> 01:27:53,400
Come on. No, no, no. Come on AI kicking

1366
01:27:54,120 --> 01:27:58,840
Yes, come on. No. No, come on AI. You know you want that jack-o-lantern

1367
01:27:59,880 --> 01:28:02,200
Look at it. It's so delicious and pumpkin looking

1368
01:28:03,720 --> 01:28:07,640
Come on. This is clearly a big bro because it's a pumpkin and Emmy's a wee pumpkin

1369
01:28:08,600 --> 01:28:10,920
What sort of fertilizer would work on you?

1370
01:28:12,600 --> 01:28:14,760
Pre-ink. Am I allowed to say that pre-ink?

1371
01:28:15,640 --> 01:28:20,200
Come on turn around. What are you aiming for? Are you going for one of my pinatas? You better not be

1372
01:28:22,680 --> 01:28:25,480
No, don't sell it. I need to wake him up. Go

1373
01:28:28,040 --> 01:28:33,160
Who are you going for? What or who are you going for?

1374
01:28:36,280 --> 01:28:40,600
I'm telling them to move out the way so he doesn't attack. Yep, right. I was on to you

1375
01:28:40,840 --> 01:28:44,760
I freaking had you. Wait, are you going over to the pumpkin that moved?

1376
01:28:45,640 --> 01:28:48,920
Right fly over to it AI. Please. Please work with me right now

1377
01:28:53,240 --> 01:28:57,080
Wait, what happened to the texture of this bad boy? He's not looking so good

1378
01:28:57,720 --> 01:29:00,520
Right, please eat the pumpkin. Where is it? Where did he go?

1379
01:29:01,880 --> 01:29:06,280
Oh, is it too late? I can see him over there

1380
01:29:11,160 --> 01:29:14,520
Stop going after my freaking pinatas

1381
01:29:17,480 --> 01:29:21,960
Eat the pumpkin. Why is the AI not kicking in? Stop

1382
01:29:24,280 --> 01:29:32,600
Oh my god, he is helping on trying to get someone sick. I'm literally like stream sniping him and stopping him from doing that

1383
01:29:33,720 --> 01:29:37,320
Eat the pumpkin. Can you not see it? Yes

1384
01:29:38,120 --> 01:29:42,040
Okay, now land in front of the pumpkin before you time out

1385
01:29:45,880 --> 01:29:48,680
Okay, the AI is having a rough time with him

1386
01:29:49,640 --> 01:29:54,440
You're scaring everyone in my garden and you're going for the mush, right?

1387
01:29:57,880 --> 01:30:04,040
I'm about to start beating him up. Just eat the pumpkin. Eat the pumpkin right now

1388
01:30:08,280 --> 01:30:12,680
Are you doing it? Are you doing it in 4k? No, why did you take off?

1389
01:30:14,440 --> 01:30:17,840
Are you gonna try and snipe someone in the air? What is going on?

1390
01:30:20,120 --> 01:30:24,360
Eat the pumpkin. No, what right? He is bugging out

1391
01:30:24,360 --> 01:30:28,680
I think because the AI wanted him to attack someone and I prevented it like all the time

1392
01:30:29,240 --> 01:30:32,600
He doesn't know what to do. I think I stream sniped a little too good

1393
01:30:32,600 --> 01:30:36,200
Oops, like it was a mistake. I didn't mean for it to happen

1394
01:30:38,040 --> 01:30:40,360
Yeah, he doesn't even know how to land right now

1395
01:30:45,000 --> 01:30:48,360
Look at him. He's going mental. We'll see a bird's eye view on him

1396
01:30:48,920 --> 01:30:53,000
He's like just doing pair of my circles right now. Oh, no, maybe

1397
01:30:55,080 --> 01:30:57,640
And he's out of bounds and he's in bounds again

1398
01:30:58,520 --> 01:31:04,440
And is he going for the mouse mallow again? I will sell this mouse mallow in defiance

1399
01:31:04,440 --> 01:31:08,440
I think he's trying to target it for some reason so I'm just selling it so it's out the garden

1400
01:31:10,680 --> 01:31:15,160
Literally the pumpkin is right there point blank. I don't know what's going on. I'll just leave it right

1401
01:31:15,800 --> 01:31:20,520
We got a new flutter scotch. I've got a blue and a red one. So we're

1402
01:31:22,280 --> 01:31:24,280
Gonna make them yellow

1403
01:31:25,000 --> 01:31:28,760
For things being teased of any type but having a stroke

1404
01:31:29,880 --> 01:31:31,880
And not the good guy

1405
01:31:35,880 --> 01:31:37,880
Okay, and it's my setting day on mine like

1406
01:31:38,440 --> 01:31:41,560
You ain't that special sir sir. You ain't that you've got a bit of an eagle

1407
01:31:41,560 --> 01:31:47,080
You need your eagles out of 10. I need you to turn it down to a five. Okay. It's good to be humble. It's good to be humble

1408
01:31:47,080 --> 01:31:50,120
Okay, right. Let's make this flutter scotch yellow

1409
01:31:50,120 --> 01:31:52,120
Oh

1410
01:31:53,560 --> 01:31:56,120
And then we have three colorful thingies

1411
01:31:57,880 --> 01:32:00,200
Who or what are you aiming at?

1412
01:32:01,480 --> 01:32:04,520
Mm-hmm. Okay. Take a right a little bit to the right

1413
01:32:06,120 --> 01:32:09,800
I swear if you were randomly going for my butterfly. Yes

1414
01:32:10,520 --> 01:32:11,880
stop

1415
01:32:11,880 --> 01:32:17,480
Just eat the pumpkin. Right. He's he's starting to upset me. So he's getting ignored. Okay

1416
01:32:17,560 --> 01:32:20,440
Do we have a taff light or did I accidentally get rid of them all?

1417
01:32:21,560 --> 01:32:27,160
He um, no, I'm not even looking in your direction. You've you've upset me. You've upset me, mr. Bat

1418
01:32:28,280 --> 01:32:34,840
Dude knows what he wants can't fault him for it. Literally. I've been upset. Right. We might have more seats that we can

1419
01:32:35,720 --> 01:32:37,720
um

1420
01:32:37,960 --> 01:32:41,880
Grow for level up a little bit more. Oh sunflower seed

1421
01:32:42,280 --> 01:32:47,320
You are my sun flower my only sun flower

1422
01:32:48,440 --> 01:32:50,440
You make me happy

1423
01:32:50,600 --> 01:32:52,600
When you grow strong

1424
01:32:52,840 --> 01:33:00,600
I'll give you fertilizer and you give me an accolade and then I'll level up some more

1425
01:33:02,520 --> 01:33:05,640
Yeah, it's not a sad song. It's a good song

1426
01:33:05,640 --> 01:33:07,640
Um

1427
01:33:07,880 --> 01:33:11,560
Okay, we did it now. We just need to over water the crap of

1428
01:33:13,320 --> 01:33:15,960
Although actually, you know what I could do

1429
01:33:17,560 --> 01:33:19,560
I could get some help

1430
01:33:21,000 --> 01:33:25,960
Mate stop teasing me. I know what you want and it's in the garden

1431
01:33:27,720 --> 01:33:30,120
We have a frog. Where's the frog?

1432
01:33:31,000 --> 01:33:36,360
Oh, there he is have eaten a tap fly. Oh, we don't have enough water for him. We're sorry

1433
01:33:36,440 --> 01:33:41,320
Let me just let me just add some more water there for you. Sorry my good sir. How do he's edging you?

1434
01:33:44,680 --> 01:33:49,080
I think oh I discovered uh, uh money in the ground

1435
01:33:50,120 --> 01:33:58,200
We're digging we're what are they called when they do the dinosaur bones and stuff from history art architect

1436
01:33:58,760 --> 01:34:00,760
No, that's when you design a building

1437
01:34:02,120 --> 01:34:07,640
Archaeology I got there. I did it on my own. I got there. I promised I didn't cheat archaeology

1438
01:34:07,720 --> 01:34:10,200
We're doing archaeology and we got coins from it

1439
01:34:13,720 --> 01:34:15,720
Oh the music in this game is so lovely too

1440
01:34:19,960 --> 01:34:23,480
I don't know if I should quickly get a tap fly to make this frog happy

1441
01:34:23,800 --> 01:34:25,800
I

1442
01:34:26,200 --> 01:34:30,680
Against my better judgment gretchums fetchums more like strong ease

1443
01:34:31,960 --> 01:34:33,960
Bonnie's thank you. I'll be here a week

1444
01:34:36,920 --> 01:34:40,200
Uh, right we need a tap fly which is blue here he is

1445
01:34:41,400 --> 01:34:47,080
Hopefully she goes. I'm really digging this game right now. I'm so glad honestly if you're looking for a chill experience

1446
01:34:47,400 --> 01:34:53,160
Yeah, you know what it is a child's game. Am I embarrassed? No, it's a fantastic game. It's well polished

1447
01:34:53,240 --> 01:34:58,920
I've never had any issues with it. I honestly think you should give it a shot and try it to the best of your ability

1448
01:35:00,040 --> 01:35:05,560
I think it's fun and you get to learn the stuff on your own. I mean, I'm kind of giving you the cheat see doodling

1449
01:35:06,040 --> 01:35:08,040
and if you focus on

1450
01:35:08,920 --> 01:35:13,480
Developing flowers and getting them all leveled up and stuff and doing like all these wee things

1451
01:35:13,880 --> 01:35:18,040
I think it's really well. He is waiting for a tap fly to show up on ironically

1452
01:35:18,520 --> 01:35:20,280
um

1453
01:35:20,280 --> 01:35:27,320
Okay, I think the most important thing next that we should do is breed all of the sparrow mints

1454
01:35:28,120 --> 01:35:30,120
because

1455
01:35:30,120 --> 01:35:32,120
um

1456
01:35:32,120 --> 01:35:35,240
Uh, we can transform them into something new

1457
01:35:36,120 --> 01:35:38,520
What is getting beaten up over there? I have no idea

1458
01:35:39,880 --> 01:35:45,640
Is the new get as in new get the thing in the thing

1459
01:35:46,600 --> 01:35:51,240
Uh, again, I asked where the dinosaur themed print. Yeah, it's in the mines

1460
01:35:54,120 --> 01:35:58,120
Oh, we got nine achievements. Oh, yeah feeling foxy

1461
01:35:59,560 --> 01:36:01,560
Foxy

1462
01:36:04,920 --> 01:36:11,800
Noogie yes. Oh, did you see his tongue before you saw him? He literally went and I'm feeling a bit silly

1463
01:36:11,800 --> 01:36:13,800
And

1464
01:36:15,160 --> 01:36:17,160
New yes

1465
01:36:20,600 --> 01:36:23,800
Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on Jameleon

1466
01:36:25,960 --> 01:36:31,000
Wait, is that the actual words to the song? I think it may be come on, come on, come on chameleon. Oh

1467
01:36:31,960 --> 01:36:37,800
Close enough close enough. Close enough. Is the frog still here? It is all the frog actually gave me a chance

1468
01:36:38,200 --> 01:36:40,200
Oh, mr. Frog

1469
01:36:40,280 --> 01:36:42,280
Guess what I have for you

1470
01:36:43,080 --> 01:36:45,080
It's a tap fly all yours

1471
01:36:46,280 --> 01:36:48,280
He looks dummy

1472
01:36:48,440 --> 01:36:51,800
Um, I made that connection. No joke. Oh, yeah

1473
01:36:52,760 --> 01:36:57,800
Wait, oh, I sold the mouse. Oh for goodness sakes. I need to order a mouse as well

1474
01:36:59,320 --> 01:37:04,120
Hey, okay. Okay. I order a mouse. I order a mouse. Maybe the snake will still be here if the snake is away

1475
01:37:04,200 --> 01:37:07,480
I will get rid of the mouse. I'm not gonna pay for it if he's already gone, right

1476
01:37:08,440 --> 01:37:10,120
Right everyone

1477
01:37:10,120 --> 01:37:11,800
On the worm team

1478
01:37:11,800 --> 01:37:15,400
No house. I need you guys to be just decimated by these

1479
01:37:16,360 --> 01:37:17,480
barrels

1480
01:37:17,480 --> 01:37:19,880
but not um

1481
01:37:19,880 --> 01:37:24,440
Not squirreling and wormling. Okay worm seven. You're done. So

1482
01:37:26,200 --> 01:37:28,200
It's the way it has to be okay

1483
01:37:29,560 --> 01:37:35,720
We're in the are you guys in the house get wake up wake up. It's humping time

1484
01:37:37,960 --> 01:37:41,560
It's humping time. Do you understand? Oh, we did it. We got the frog

1485
01:37:42,280 --> 01:37:45,240
Now if I'm not mistaken, I need to feed him

1486
01:37:45,800 --> 01:37:49,720
A berry and then hit him when he doesn't feel well. It's rather brutal for him

1487
01:37:50,360 --> 01:37:55,720
Oh, we got a fudge hug. I thought it was karma chameleon. I actually don't know

1488
01:37:56,440 --> 01:37:58,920
Homeless literally just made them home with sorry

1489
01:37:59,640 --> 01:38:01,640
It's

1490
01:38:05,720 --> 01:38:07,720
Reeflings after a session

1491
01:38:09,880 --> 01:38:12,200
Is that what you said like is the snake still here?

1492
01:38:14,600 --> 01:38:21,560
Oh, it is okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Let him get up. Let him get up. It's karma chameleon. Okay

1493
01:38:23,640 --> 01:38:25,640
I said come on

1494
01:38:26,200 --> 01:38:34,120
My boy furgy it is furgy right you go attack that snake you have my permission. No, you get eaten by the snake

1495
01:38:34,280 --> 01:38:36,280
Okay, that tree's fine

1496
01:38:36,840 --> 01:38:38,840
Okay, well unfortunately

1497
01:38:39,240 --> 01:38:43,560
The birds have gone to sleep. I will give you permission to sleep just this once. Okay

1498
01:38:44,280 --> 01:38:47,480
But just this once no other time will I give you permission?

1499
01:38:48,040 --> 01:38:50,040
Do I make myself clear?

1500
01:38:50,120 --> 01:38:55,400
No, we do actually need another taff life or an achievement, which I'm going to show you

1501
01:38:57,160 --> 01:39:00,280
Are you ready for this? You're not ready for this taff life

1502
01:39:01,160 --> 01:39:06,280
I'm showing you all the secret strats. Okay. You're welcome. Oh, there's like a little purple berry

1503
01:39:08,520 --> 01:39:10,520
Reeflings it's your boss

1504
01:39:12,040 --> 01:39:17,240
Would you have per because wait the a more artist drew your mouse

1505
01:39:18,120 --> 01:39:24,440
Purple and I'm like does that mean your little boss or purple as well like lord?

1506
01:39:25,080 --> 01:39:31,480
Wait, hello. What can I be of service? I see in two worms in a thistle. Okay. Okay. Okay. We're on the clock

1507
01:39:31,640 --> 01:39:33,960
It's we're on the clock, but I think we can do it

1508
01:39:34,920 --> 01:39:37,560
I think we can do it right. Let's grow a thistle really quickly

1509
01:39:37,640 --> 01:39:41,960
But we need to make sure no one walks into it if a pinata gets hit by a thistle

1510
01:39:42,440 --> 01:39:47,080
It gets really aggressive for no reason. Well, it gets aggressive because it got hurt and

1511
01:39:47,560 --> 01:39:50,680
When you get hurt you lash out. So, you know what? It's understandable

1512
01:39:51,240 --> 01:39:53,240
blue berries

1513
01:39:53,480 --> 01:39:55,480
Uh a past blue of purple, okay

1514
01:39:56,760 --> 01:40:01,320
When you put us in the cage purple balls is the next step after blue then they explode. Okay

1515
01:40:01,880 --> 01:40:03,880
Okay, bit dramatic bit dramatic but I get it

1516
01:40:04,760 --> 01:40:06,760
Uh see you go away

1517
01:40:06,840 --> 01:40:10,520
Literally the first thing whenever you grow like a bad thingy

1518
01:40:11,080 --> 01:40:16,920
It like always goes nuts being like do you want to do this? No, I don't want to do this, please

1519
01:40:17,720 --> 01:40:19,720
morning

1520
01:40:20,040 --> 01:40:24,760
Like no, I don't want you to go into the little thistle when you grow a bad a bad plant, but some

1521
01:40:25,240 --> 01:40:27,240
a

1522
01:40:30,840 --> 01:40:35,880
Watching you play this and geek out is so damn adorable. My heart just can't take it

1523

1525
01:40:51,960 --> 01:40:57,240
And then when I'm like making jokes and stuff like nothing comes out the way I want to thank you anonymous for the tip

1526
01:40:57,240 --> 01:41:03,000
I'll be such a good horticulturist horticulturist for you. I'll be the goodest horticulturist of all

1527
01:41:04,680 --> 01:41:07,800
Oh, no, wait that did that fudge hog just kill one of the

1528
01:41:08,520 --> 01:41:14,040
Starting pinatas the body bear. Oh, finally, right. He must have just bugged out the first time he was in the gear bin

1529
01:41:14,360 --> 01:41:18,920
That's fine yet a lot of bugs. Oh, okay. You ready for this? Are you ready?

1530
01:41:20,920 --> 01:41:22,920
Are you ready for what happens then?

1531
01:41:26,360 --> 01:41:31,960
Don't panic. I've seen it. I'm on my way. Don't panic

1532
01:41:32,760 --> 01:41:34,760
Oh

1533
01:41:37,240 --> 01:41:39,240
He's going to but he's working through it

1534
01:41:43,800 --> 01:41:45,800
Oh, don't worry you can push through it

1535
01:41:47,000 --> 01:41:53,800
He so he's gonna come and fix puzzle gum, but don't worry puzzle gum's fine. Right. Watch what look

1536
01:41:54,760 --> 01:41:56,360
He made it

1537
01:41:57,320 --> 01:42:03,880
You're so smart mr. Ta fly now fly into this right now. Thank you

1538
01:42:07,720 --> 01:42:09,720
Almost

1539
01:42:10,280 --> 01:42:12,600
Like his little car thing he has to like

1540
01:42:14,680 --> 01:42:17,240
Yeah, wait, is that Freddy fazbear?

1541
01:42:17,640 --> 01:42:19,640
Oh

1542
01:42:21,160 --> 01:42:27,320
That's dardos. No, this is the bad guy. He kills the pinatas if they're left ill for too long

1543
01:42:29,400 --> 01:42:31,400
You stink

1544
01:42:33,080 --> 01:42:36,600
Let me introduce the star. I think he's the brother of lethal

1545
01:42:37,240 --> 01:42:41,560
Sick pinata. I'm stealing their sweets. It's very difficult to stop

1546
01:42:42,040 --> 01:42:46,280
If only you could make the pinata well, then he wouldn't try to get their sweets

1547
01:42:47,640 --> 01:42:51,160
So you can use patch to heal pinatas that fall sick

1548
01:42:52,280 --> 01:42:55,000
But if they're sick for too long, he'll destroy them

1549
01:42:55,640 --> 01:42:57,160
Which is a shame

1550
01:42:57,160 --> 01:42:59,160
That's dardos more like

1551
01:42:59,400 --> 01:43:04,280
Well, funny you mentioned that so that's his dad's that's talking to us now

1552
01:43:05,160 --> 01:43:07,160
And lea fos is the sister

1553
01:43:07,480 --> 01:43:13,960
So he's not in the family. So that's dardos is a bath dardos. So you're no wrong

1554
01:43:14,920 --> 01:43:16,920
They put spinatas out there misery

1555
01:43:18,120 --> 01:43:20,120
No

1556
01:43:26,120 --> 01:43:32,520
Hi there gardener, need a weedling? I know I'm smolding shoes, but I know how to make any weed disappear

1558
01:43:39,800 --> 01:43:41,800

Whoa, this is pinata central. Hi pinata central

A sour crota

Crola what's the pun in crola's name?

1592
01:46:16,440 --> 01:46:20,760
I can't think of a sweet that sounds like crola. It sounds like cruella the

1593
01:46:21,880 --> 01:46:23,880
the um

1594
01:46:24,600 --> 01:46:26,600
The thing that marines eat

1595
01:46:28,840 --> 01:46:31,000
The you draw with them

1596
01:46:31,960 --> 01:46:36,760
What are they called? I've completely forgotten what those are called. Oh a cola?

1597
01:46:37,880 --> 01:46:39,880
Oh, maybe cola

1598
01:46:41,800 --> 01:46:43,800
A quackberry

1599
01:46:44,280 --> 01:46:47,880
Oh, we've unlocked ivor ivor is down on his luck

1600
01:46:49,080 --> 01:46:51,320
But with help he might be on

1601
01:46:52,200 --> 01:46:57,880
Much better term. Okay. Always root for the underdog dog. Why do I say dag?

1602
01:46:58,680 --> 01:47:03,320
Man dag don't the dog one dog. Don't wonder it. Are you squid me right now?

1603
01:47:04,360 --> 01:47:11,000
Anonymous whether you're a sweet little lollipop or a full-aged scottish whiskey. We will always love you. You're bad

1604
01:47:11,560 --> 01:47:17,160
You're bad. I'm gonna call you bombs yet. You're a bomb. You're a bomb. You're a bomb. You're a bomb. You're a bomb

1605
01:47:17,160 --> 01:47:19,160
You're all bombs, but you're my bad

1606
01:47:21,320 --> 01:47:25,000
Thank you anonymous for the tip and remain to me. I used to see bam. I forgot

1607
01:47:25,640 --> 01:47:31,160
What's this a beggar? He must have heard about your ever-increasing garden value. You should deal with him immediately

1608
01:47:31,640 --> 01:47:38,600
Leaf boss. That's very judgmental of you. I assure you that most homeless people don't actually want to be in the situation

1609
01:47:38,920 --> 01:47:42,120
Most homeless people struggle with mental health and drug addiction

1610
01:47:42,280 --> 01:47:47,320
Which makes them say things and do things that they don't actually mean and yes, of course

1611
01:47:47,400 --> 01:47:54,360
There's scenarios and situations where people who are homeless say they're better off in the streets because what other solutions do they have

1612
01:47:54,680 --> 01:47:56,680
Their family have given up on them

1613
01:47:56,920 --> 01:48:04,360
Which is understandable for the family because they're being drug-independent and they've done behaviors that are damaging and dangerous within the household

1614
01:48:04,600 --> 01:48:10,280
But leafos you shouldn't be so judgmental. Sometimes um, it's a lot easier to judge

1615
01:48:10,440 --> 01:48:15,320
But if you're in their shoes, you might be in the same scenarios and do the same things. Okay

1616
01:48:16,280 --> 01:48:19,320
So please be open-minded. It's okay leafos

1617
01:48:19,640 --> 01:48:23,960
But you can learn to be better as a person without the judgmental aspect

1618
01:48:24,200 --> 01:48:29,800
Did you know that average american is only two checks away from being homeless? That's scary leafos

1619
01:48:29,960 --> 01:48:35,640
Think of the economy think of the citizens that try their best and work nine to five and do the way

1620
01:48:35,880 --> 01:48:39,960
Do the thing that society told them to do and yet they still can't find relief

1621
01:48:40,360 --> 01:48:47,160
Or any sort of outlets for the stress they go through. No wonder people turn to drugs and alcoholism

1622
01:48:47,320 --> 01:48:53,560
I'm sorry leafos. Please don't do that again. But thank you for your input. Anyway, we unlocked iber

1623
01:49:07,240 --> 01:49:12,680
Boom, thank you. Look look at all the seeds. We're gonna all the sweeties that'll drop from the sky

1624
01:49:12,920 --> 01:49:18,600
Look, there's lots of sweeties in the garden now. All the pinatas will eat the sweeties and they'll all be nice and happy

1625
01:49:20,520 --> 01:49:25,160
I can't believe it. We reached utopia, but it was in viva pinata. Let's go

1626
01:49:26,920 --> 01:49:28,920
Viva pinata devs were so real for that

1627
01:49:32,040 --> 01:49:35,240
That was strongy. That was strongy and welcome to my TED talk

1628
01:49:37,000 --> 01:49:41,160
Even the language used around people who are drug addicts is quite um

1629
01:49:41,880 --> 01:49:43,000
detrimental

1630
01:49:43,000 --> 01:49:45,400
No one wants to be called a junkie in passing

1631
01:49:45,960 --> 01:49:48,280
Some people are drug dependent and that's okay

1632
01:49:48,520 --> 01:49:52,840
Some people's brains are wired to be more addicted to the average person personally

1633
01:49:52,840 --> 01:50:00,440
I've never tried any recreational drugs because I'm aware of how much I use gaming and I drink cola as a vice

1634
01:50:00,680 --> 01:50:05,560
So I know that I am most likely a very have a very addictive personality

1635
01:50:05,960 --> 01:50:10,280
And I like to imagine the best in uh people and that's fine

1636
01:50:11,800 --> 01:50:17,000
Oh, they touched the thistle. I told you not to touch the thistle stop touching the thistle

1637
01:50:17,160 --> 01:50:20,120
Oh, wait, sorry buzzle comes and reasons hate each other

1638
01:50:23,400 --> 01:50:24,920
I don't mind

1639
01:50:24,920 --> 01:50:28,200
Being called a strongy junkie. No drug dependent

1640
01:50:28,840 --> 01:50:30,440
junkies, uh

1641
01:50:30,440 --> 01:50:32,440
Sometimes it's a little mean I guess

1642
01:50:33,240 --> 01:50:35,240
It's like calling me

1643
01:50:35,400 --> 01:50:40,920
I don't know what you would call me a whore unaffectionately. How dare you refer to me unaffectionately

1644
01:50:40,920 --> 01:50:42,920
With that terminology

1645
01:50:43,800 --> 01:50:48,920
War in the garden is broken out. I'm stuck in this cut. I can't back out. I don't know if you can hear that

1646
01:50:49,080 --> 01:50:53,800
I can't back out. I'm like literally stuck in I have to watch them fight. I can't even interfere

1647
01:50:55,720 --> 01:50:58,360
Don't talk about cool ejection. You used to drink 1.5

1648
01:50:59,160 --> 01:51:02,520
It's not your fault. They literally lab make that stuff

1649
01:51:03,960 --> 01:51:05,960
and

1650
01:51:06,520 --> 01:51:09,320
I'm just straight up having to watch them fight until someone loses. Oh

1651
01:51:09,880 --> 01:51:15,800
Oh, say the bumblebee's gonna win. I'm actually gonna sell the reason because they always fight in a garden

1652
01:51:18,600 --> 01:51:23,400
Strongy calling people a junkie is very damaging. I told you not to touch the thistle

1653
01:51:24,840 --> 01:51:31,000
I thought they touched it right what we need is actually just the thistle head. So if we destroy the thistle

1654
01:51:31,800 --> 01:51:36,920
We'll just left the round at thistle head. I'm strongly dependent on two tips away from the streets

1655
01:51:40,440 --> 01:51:41,880
Don't do that

1656
01:51:41,880 --> 01:51:48,040
Whatever you do. I only have a thousand coins to give. Oh iver. I'm so sorry. I don't have a lot of money on my persons right now

1657
01:51:48,920 --> 01:51:54,360
Thank you spidey for the tip. You better not be I'll literally start throwing hands violently

1658
01:51:54,920 --> 01:51:56,280
Hi iver

1659
01:51:56,280 --> 01:51:58,280
You're very generous indeed

1660
01:51:58,440 --> 01:52:01,400
I just want you to know that thanks to your coins and goodwill

1661
01:52:02,040 --> 01:52:08,600
We'll be different the next time we need for now. Please accept a beggars. Thanks and his oh good. Bye iver

1662
01:52:08,760 --> 01:52:14,280
I hope you can land on your feet. I'm sorry. It was so little but maybe it can do something for you

1663
01:52:15,480 --> 01:52:20,920
I believe in you even when no one else does even when leafos is being a judgemental

1664
01:52:20,920 --> 01:52:22,920
Oh

1665
01:52:24,600 --> 01:52:29,560
Dear one of your pinatas is being trampled that will make them unhappy trampled who what where why when?

1666
01:52:31,640 --> 01:52:34,840

1667
01:52:39,160 --> 01:52:41,160
Oh no, oh

No, I don't like hearing its little pain cries. Please

1669
01:52:46,120 --> 01:52:48,120
I only have 20 coins

1670
01:52:48,120 --> 01:52:50,120
It costs 50

1671
01:52:51,400 --> 01:52:54,600
So if I'm in a box sign the street, I shouldn't send this

1672
01:52:57,400 --> 01:53:03,640
No, you shouldn't don't be in a box in the street. You're you'll honestly upset me some streamers like find it funny

1673
01:53:03,800 --> 01:53:05,800
I actually don't find it funny

1674
01:53:06,440 --> 01:53:08,440
like it upsets me um

1675
01:53:08,920 --> 01:53:11,080

01:53:18,840 --> 01:53:21,080
You know your debts are paid off

1678
01:53:21,800 --> 01:53:28,200
You've got savings like all this is really important. I don't want you thinking like i'm a more important than what's going on with you

1679
01:53:28,280 --> 01:53:30,280
You know, you know

1680
01:53:31,480 --> 01:53:33,480
Hello, you know

1681
01:53:34,120 --> 01:53:35,480
Okay

1682
01:53:35,480 --> 01:53:37,480
That poor thing. Please heal him

1683
01:53:38,200 --> 01:53:40,200
I

1684
01:53:40,680 --> 01:53:43,480
Don't want to hear his little pain cries. I feel so bad

1685
01:53:45,320 --> 01:53:47,320
No

1686
01:53:49,240 --> 01:53:55,240
I don't like his wee pain cries. Oh, you feel better, baby. Yeah, you feel better. I'm gonna sell you for safety

1687
01:53:55,480 --> 01:53:58,360
Oh dark dirty. He came out to kill him

1688
01:53:59,880 --> 01:54:01,880
We hate you

1689
01:54:02,360 --> 01:54:04,600
I like to like tooth. We hate you

1690
01:54:05,320 --> 01:54:10,360
Right. I'm gonna sell these trees because they actually get worth quite a lot

1691
01:54:11,320 --> 01:54:13,320
Oh

1692
01:54:13,720 --> 01:54:17,720
Uh, oh we've got a new color. Let's make them green

1693
01:54:20,200 --> 01:54:22,200
Time to go green

1694
01:54:23,240 --> 01:54:25,240
Oh mr. Flores scotch

1695
01:54:26,200 --> 01:54:32,680
Your green abedy. Oh, hold on. Hold on. I need to grab you. Okay, and then I'll pop you there

1696
01:54:35,400 --> 01:54:37,400
Okay, we do have

1697
01:54:38,360 --> 01:54:40,360
sparrowman

1698
01:54:40,600 --> 01:54:46,520
Actually, I think I need Gretchen to bring in another one. Yes, and then we can make baby able to get a fudge hog

1699
01:54:47,800 --> 01:54:51,960
So i'm gonna get one more worm just in case what if my debt is payable in 30 years?

1700
01:54:51,960 --> 01:54:55,160
Am I allowed to do no mortgage hate? I don't know

1701
01:54:56,600 --> 01:55:01,320
If you put like $50 extra a month to your mortgage, do you get penalized for that?

1702
01:55:02,600 --> 01:55:05,720
Oh like dinner off the Ivers opened up a shop

1703
01:55:07,320 --> 01:55:09,320
Ta-da

1704
01:55:09,400 --> 01:55:15,400
Quite an improvement. What my basic level of hygiene is not the only change for I have also set up a grand news

1705
01:55:15,480 --> 01:55:17,480
Oh, that's fantastic

1706
01:55:17,480 --> 01:55:23,320
I'll kill with the most special items I find on my many travels. My apologies if I'm ever away

1707
01:55:23,400 --> 01:55:28,600
But should you notice the store is open? Uh-huh. I urge you to pay me a visit and peruse whichever items

1708
01:55:28,680 --> 01:55:32,760
I have managed to find on my latest trip. Of course. See you soon. I hope

1709
01:55:33,400 --> 01:55:36,680
Oh, thank you. Lovely. Lovely. Oh

1710
01:55:43,320 --> 01:55:47,320
You can pay extra towards the principal. Yes, if you're ever paying extra towards your

1711
01:55:48,040 --> 01:55:54,200
Uh mortgage, please make sure you're doing it towards the principal and not the interest by default

1712
01:55:54,280 --> 01:55:56,680
The banks will try and make you pay against your interest

1713
01:55:57,400 --> 01:56:00,520
Don't let them win

1714
01:56:02,040 --> 01:56:07,320
Don't worry the high table plans will come out soon. You just have to wait refling you have to be patient for me

1715
01:56:08,040 --> 01:56:10,040
Soon my sweet weebaw

1716
01:56:10,520 --> 01:56:12,520
You will attack

1717
01:56:13,400 --> 01:56:15,400
I shouldn't say such things

1718
01:56:16,120 --> 01:56:20,600
Okay, we are going to put another worm in the garden

1719
01:56:22,680 --> 01:56:24,280
Um

1720
01:56:24,280 --> 01:56:26,280
And hopes of getting a fudge hog

1721
01:56:26,600 --> 01:56:27,400
You

1722
01:56:27,400 --> 01:56:31,560
But bankers make more money the slower you pay off the mortgage. Yes

1723
01:56:32,040 --> 01:56:36,600
So if you have an extra $50, don't give it to me you goofy goober

1724
01:56:37,320 --> 01:56:42,200
Try and pay against your principal because if every month you did an extra $50

1725
01:56:42,840 --> 01:56:48,040
It makes a difference on the interest overall and you're saving yourself tons of smack of your knees. Okay

1726
01:56:48,680 --> 01:56:53,400
I will teach you all the tricks and the fun part is if you pay your debt mortgages off earlier

1727
01:56:53,400 --> 01:56:58,680
It puts your credit score down. Yes. Oh, okay. Time to put my tinfoil hat on. Did you know the credit score?

1728
01:56:59,000 --> 01:57:05,160
Credit score is a complete scam if you have no debts debit cards only no credit and no debts towards anything

1729
01:57:05,320 --> 01:57:07,320
Your credit score is considered

1730
01:57:07,320 --> 01:57:09,320
shit

1731
01:57:10,040 --> 01:57:13,240
Now let me just repeat that again for those who didn't hear in the back

1732
01:57:15,640 --> 01:57:23,400
If you have no debts full savings and nothing is wrong

1733
01:57:25,240 --> 01:57:27,240
Your credit score will be bad

1734
01:57:29,000 --> 01:57:35,160
But if you're indebted to the car dealership if you're indebted via a mortgage if you're indebted

1735
01:57:35,800 --> 01:57:38,440
Via a small credit card

1736
01:57:39,160 --> 01:57:41,160
You have good credit

1737
01:57:41,160 --> 01:57:47,000
Tell me credit score isn't a scam without telling me credit score isn't

1738
01:57:48,040 --> 01:57:49,560
a scam

1739
01:57:49,560 --> 01:57:51,320
Okay, no

1740
01:57:51,320 --> 01:57:54,280
No, no, no, I know I get passionate about the high table

1741
01:57:55,000 --> 01:57:59,320
All I'm saying is if you live at home with your family

1742
01:57:59,960 --> 01:58:02,200
Guess what don't be embarrassed about it

1743
01:58:03,080 --> 01:58:06,760
Why on earth should you move out the moment you turn 18 types up? Okay

1744
01:58:07,640 --> 01:58:09,640
Oh, no, we unlocked the ruffian

1745
01:58:10,440 --> 01:58:12,440
I think I need captain cutlass

1746
01:58:13,000 --> 01:58:14,840
to stop them coming

1747
01:58:14,840 --> 01:58:16,200
um

1748
01:58:16,200 --> 01:58:22,760
Okay, okay, okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. So a ruffian is showing up. Oh, I've got the achievement for the shovel

1749
01:58:24,360 --> 01:58:27,800
Credit scores only exist to stop whamen owning land. They recreate the same year

1750
01:58:27,800 --> 01:58:30,040
The u.s. government allowed whamen to get divorced

1751
01:58:31,080 --> 01:58:33,480
Stop I didn't even hear that

1752
01:58:34,200 --> 01:58:36,200
down with the high table

1753
01:58:36,280 --> 01:58:40,920
John wickling. Thank you for the tip down with the high table

1754
01:58:42,040 --> 01:58:47,960
If I am not being a silly billy. I think iver has an item called the cutlass and oh, he's not unlocked it

1755
01:58:47,960 --> 01:58:49,960
Yeah, I'm not labeled up enough

1756
01:58:50,680 --> 01:58:55,400
I'm confident. There are things you could be tempted to buy from ivor's portal

1757
01:58:58,520 --> 01:59:00,520
Are you squinting right now?

1758
01:59:01,400 --> 01:59:06,440
Thanks for the tips. Wait, why are you saying thanks to the tip for me? Or do you mean against your mortgage?

1759
01:59:06,600 --> 01:59:10,280
Oh, don't worry. Whatever information I know. I'll try my best to share it

1760
01:59:10,440 --> 01:59:16,360
Now, please do take everything I say with a green assault. I miss remember things and I'm also very silly

1761
01:59:16,760 --> 01:59:20,680
Um, so I'm sorry if I say anything wrong. I'm just

1762
01:59:21,480 --> 01:59:25,320
Bucket I'm just having a good time and I hope we can all have a good time

1763
01:59:26,120 --> 01:59:31,800
But yeah, uh, if you have a mortgage or you're thinking about a mortgage, um, you have to pay against the

1764
01:59:32,280 --> 01:59:34,680
principle is the terminology for the loan

1765
01:59:35,560 --> 01:59:39,560
Um, not against the interest the interest is where the banks win. Okay

1766
01:59:40,280 --> 01:59:42,680
We want the banks to lose as quick as possible

1767
01:59:43,240 --> 01:59:45,240
So we're working on

1768
01:59:47,000 --> 01:59:49,720
Don't worry. I like spreading misinformation on the internet

1769
01:59:50,040 --> 01:59:52,440
We do a bit of tomfoolery on the internet

1770
01:59:52,600 --> 01:59:57,960
Did you know that haggis is a an animal that lives in the highlands only and they're very hard to harvest

1771
01:59:58,680 --> 02:00:04,840
But you can only hunt them during breeding season because their numbers become like outrageously big

1772
02:00:05,960 --> 02:00:07,400
um

1773
02:00:07,400 --> 02:00:12,200
So it's very hard. Oh my god. Look at his color scheme

1774
02:00:13,000 --> 02:00:20,600
I love him. Thank you for playing every aspect of my childhood days without strony streams feel so empty

1775
02:00:21,240 --> 02:00:23,480
Why aren't you glad I'm a daily streamer then, huh?

1776
02:00:24,600 --> 02:00:31,160
Thank you logo doggie logo doggie for the a super chat and thank you cam chaos for the super chat

1777
02:00:31,400 --> 02:00:38,840
I'm sure if that is your thing that a day without strony feels empty. Oh boy, you're glad i'm addicted to streaming

1778
02:00:39,560 --> 02:00:40,760
I know you are

1779
02:00:40,840 --> 02:00:42,520
I'd admit it

1780
02:00:42,520 --> 02:00:45,000
I'd admit it. Mm-hmm. I'd admit it. You're addicted

1781
02:00:46,920 --> 02:00:48,920
Okay, we are

1782
02:00:49,560 --> 02:00:53,880
Your friend you will never be alone again

1783
02:00:55,720 --> 02:00:59,320
Sorry, just warming up for the karaoke surprise karaoke stream

1784
02:01:00,200 --> 02:01:03,960
When when am I doing it? I don't know yet. Let me cook. Okay. Let me cook

1785
02:01:04,600 --> 02:01:09,080
I don't know when i'm doing it, but we are gonna grow some corn because we're gonna turn it into bread

1786
02:01:10,760 --> 02:01:12,760
Oh

1787
02:01:13,080 --> 02:01:16,120
Oops, I actually would like you to survive hold on

1788
02:01:17,080 --> 02:01:19,080
All right, I think she's a bit more

1789
02:01:19,640 --> 02:01:21,640
You've groomed us to be here every day at this time

1790
02:01:22,920 --> 02:01:25,560
Now don't worry if you do have life obligations

1791
02:01:25,640 --> 02:01:29,640
You might be a vod watcher right now or you might be kind of listening to me in the background

1792
02:01:30,120 --> 02:01:36,120
If you have obligations, it's very important that you do prioritize what is going on with the

1793
02:01:37,080 --> 02:01:39,080
texture on the water

1794
02:01:40,920 --> 02:01:43,160
It's really having a rough time with it. Honestly

1795
02:01:44,040 --> 02:01:45,080
Um

1796
02:01:45,080 --> 02:01:49,240
Yeah, please don't write what I want to do. Should I get more red hot? I think I should

1797
02:01:52,200 --> 02:01:54,200
Right, I will

1798
02:01:56,360 --> 02:02:00,840
No, right first things first i'm the realest um i'm not but uh

1799
02:02:02,680 --> 02:02:09,400
First things first we'll do you guys so we're gonna make all the birds hump and then we're gonna make them all yellow

1800
02:02:10,760 --> 02:02:16,440
Where if the sparrows would stop being in the trees for five seconds?

1801
02:02:16,760 --> 02:02:20,200
So I can deal with you. I can't even tap the tree because the fruits aren't done

1802
02:02:21,480 --> 02:02:24,840
And I would waste all that produce right. I think he's about to come in right

1803
02:02:24,920 --> 02:02:30,600
What do you want a bottle of medicine? Are you be lining for the medicine? No, you're not. How dare you?

1804
02:02:31,720 --> 02:02:33,240

02:03:02,040 --> 02:03:10,280
Corn into bread. I don't ask about it. I mean you can make corn bread. Oh, it's an american game. It's corn bread

1812
02:03:11,160 --> 02:03:16,600
I never understood why corn turns into bread. We don't have corn bread

1813
02:03:17,400 --> 02:03:18,280

02:03:18,280 --> 02:03:20,280

Strongly cuddles keeping the reeflings

02:05:20,760 --> 02:05:26,280
Giggling drained and well maintained. Wait, did I make that up? Wait, did I mess that up not make that up?

02:06:09,320 --> 02:06:17,160
Nonsense technique and enough expertise to be called a professional gardener. I'm professional. We're not experienced. We're professional

1857
02:06:17,560 --> 02:06:20,120
Oh, I got a jammillion. Where is it?

02:06:53,880 --> 02:06:55,880
British accent for american people

02:06:57,080 --> 02:06:59,080

1868
02:06:59,080 --> 02:07:01,080

1870
02:07:08,040 --> 02:07:10,440
Right now. We are gonna sell him

1871
02:07:11,320 --> 02:07:14,440
Not him. We need to do something with him, but I don't think I've unlocked it yet

1872
02:07:15,320 --> 02:07:17,320
Um, I'm working

1873
02:07:17,320 --> 02:07:19,320
I'm working babe

1874
02:07:19,880 --> 02:07:22,680
That boy's a singer. That's not the words at all

1875
02:07:22,760 --> 02:07:27,560
So we are gonna sell the jammillion because he's a constant money source when he comes in

1876
02:07:28,200 --> 02:07:30,600
Um, so we'll keep getting more jammillions

1877
02:07:31,720 --> 02:07:33,960
Level 17 don't mind if uh

1878
02:07:35,640 --> 02:07:40,120
Right you beat up any worm that isn't got a name

1879
02:07:42,040 --> 02:07:45,160
Okay squirreling and wait, is there only is there only two left?

1880
02:07:47,080 --> 02:07:51,480
How many are in the garden current residents too? Okay, so we're gonna get them to have the sweets now

1881
02:07:51,880 --> 02:07:59,560
Okay, please eat sweet and please eat sweet and then we will turn them all yellow

1882
02:08:00,520 --> 02:08:06,600
We'll turn them we'll make them a british chinese and make them all yellow because all the food in a british chinese is fucking yellow

1883
02:08:07,080 --> 02:08:13,480
But it's delicious though. Honestly. Sorry. Um, that's one thing I miss about scotland a good fucking chinese

1884
02:08:14,440 --> 02:08:17,880
Now there is a word for chinese in scotland

1885
02:08:18,520 --> 02:08:20,520
um that's seen as racist

1886
02:08:21,320 --> 02:08:25,000
Um, I don't know if you guys know it actually maybe I shouldn't talk about it

1887
02:08:25,480 --> 02:08:31,480
But if so you might hear some scottish people use that terminology and people are like oh, that's racist

1888
02:08:31,720 --> 02:08:37,080
There's absolutely no racism behind it. Um, there's zero racism. It's literally just what it used to be called

1889
02:08:37,400 --> 02:08:39,400
What is it? Well, I'm not gonna say it. I'll

1890
02:08:40,760 --> 02:08:42,120
um

1891
02:08:42,120 --> 02:08:45,560
Right, I'll sell this puzzle gun for some extra monies as well

1892
02:08:46,840 --> 02:08:48,840
um

1893
02:08:49,320 --> 02:08:55,400
We'll do the tat we'll do the spirulments first. I'm actually gonna plant some extra

1894
02:08:57,160 --> 02:08:58,440
Um

1895
02:08:58,440 --> 02:09:07,080
Oh, we have a new seed. We have a fir tree and a venus fly trap not the other variation. I almost just said um

1896
02:09:09,000 --> 02:09:16,680
Right, we've got a fir tree. I'll try and look after it. She said she has no intention to look over it. Um, why am I in the shop?

1897
02:09:19,720 --> 02:09:28,200
I have forgotten why I'm in the shop. Okay. Well, that's fine. We can back out something along the lines of a

1898
02:09:29,960 --> 02:09:31,400
No

1899
02:09:31,400 --> 02:09:34,920
Oh, so no wait, is there no british or scottish person in here?

1900
02:09:37,800 --> 02:09:39,800
A venus fly trap real

1901
02:09:40,040 --> 02:09:46,200
Real true. Oh, I was gonna make more butter scotches because we're about to just decimate the but oh, did you see the little bird?

1902
02:09:47,160 --> 02:09:50,200
So I'm not the only person any any butter room

1903
02:09:51,560 --> 02:09:53,560
I'm buttering right now

1904
02:09:54,120 --> 02:09:56,120
It's probably the old word. No

1905
02:09:57,800 --> 02:10:01,080
Sounds like inky. Okay, there you go. There is someone that doesn't know this

1906
02:10:01,880 --> 02:10:07,720
So, um, there's like a big debate if it's racism, but literally all of scotland is like, uh, no, it's literally just what we call it

1907
02:10:09,400 --> 02:10:12,520
And so I'm praying I don't slip up on stream

1908
02:10:13,640 --> 02:10:15,240
Because it's offensive

1909
02:10:15,240 --> 02:10:17,800
But I don't I don't want it to be offensive, you know

1910
02:10:18,680 --> 02:10:20,680
Oh my god

1911
02:10:23,800 --> 02:10:28,760
Oh, he's getting big. Oh, he's growing. Oh, you're gonna be such a big little birdie. Oh

1912
02:10:29,720 --> 02:10:34,520
Your multiply you get so big you're big and strong your little cutie pie

1913
02:10:35,240 --> 02:10:37,240
You're so cute

1914
02:10:37,640 --> 02:10:39,640
Okay, we have a quackberry. No

1915
02:10:40,920 --> 02:10:43,800
I think the quackberry has to eat a night shade

1916
02:10:44,360 --> 02:10:47,800
Berry and then I whack it and it becomes a gooseberry

1917
02:10:48,440 --> 02:10:53,800
Okay, so there's a lot of berries being thrown around. So if you have dyslexia, I'm so sorry about making it worse

1918
02:10:54,440 --> 02:10:59,240
Him. Oh, I'm gonna turn this off because I think everyone's flying into it and burning themselves

1919
02:11:00,440 --> 02:11:02,440
Okay, so we're gonna have what a fifth one

1920
02:11:03,400 --> 02:11:05,400
and then

1921
02:11:05,480 --> 02:11:08,280
Okay, we need one more sweetie

1922
02:11:08,920 --> 02:11:10,200
technically

1923
02:11:10,200 --> 02:11:12,200
A crack berry. No

1924
02:11:14,280 --> 02:11:16,280
I get it now. Thanks for using

1925
02:11:16,680 --> 02:11:18,680
an excellent

1926
02:11:18,760 --> 02:11:21,080
I know but I'm not gonna say it. Yeah real real based through

1927
02:11:23,400 --> 02:11:24,440
Uh

1928
02:11:24,440 --> 02:11:26,440
Plap mallows are the best

1929
02:11:26,760 --> 02:11:31,560
Plap mouse mallows. Are you plapping the fucking mouse pin?

1930
02:11:34,200 --> 02:11:39,560
What are you doing in your your viva pinata gameplay? Are you plapping the mice?

1931
02:11:40,360 --> 02:11:42,360
What's going on here?

1932
02:11:43,320 --> 02:11:47,800
Leave my gen to train conductor mouse that goes chi chi. Oh, okay

1933
02:11:49,160 --> 02:11:51,160
Leave her alone

1934
02:11:52,120 --> 02:11:56,280
She didn't mean it. She just got come puzzled. Okay. Wait if I sell bread, does it work?

1935
02:11:56,360 --> 02:12:03,400
It's only worth the 60 but she sells it for how much in our shop? Sorry. I need to like water the crap out of this

1936
02:12:03,800 --> 02:12:06,120
over water. It's like to filth right now

1937
02:12:06,680 --> 02:12:15,400
Over water over. Oh my god. I never even said I sung Freru jacka in the soft spoken voice

1938
02:12:15,960 --> 02:12:20,280
And I was like, you know what? This actually is really nice. I might do humming and like

1939
02:12:20,920 --> 02:12:27,400
Playing with your hair ASMR or something. I didn't mind it. I thought I was gonna dislike it because I don't feel very confident

1940
02:12:27,880 --> 02:12:33,320
But but it actually made the role play like really tie together

1941
02:12:33,640 --> 02:12:38,120
Because I was saying to you in the in the pregnant with you ASMR that I'm like, oh

1942
02:12:38,680 --> 02:12:41,400
I'm not very confident, but I'll do anything for you

1943
02:12:41,400 --> 02:12:44,600
And I think it's important to push yourself like past your boundaries

1944
02:12:45,080 --> 02:12:52,600
That make me might make you unhappy or might make you uncomfortable in the moment because if you push past it

1945
02:12:53,880 --> 02:13:00,920
Um, you may discover that you had an amazing time and I want you to be brave and reach out to the world around you

1946
02:13:01,000 --> 02:13:03,000
Oh, I'm not gonna sell him. He's mine

1947
02:13:03,080 --> 02:13:04,280
um

1948
02:13:04,280 --> 02:13:10,200
You know, again a moth drop is kind of like income source. So if it looks mean that I'm selling them

1949
02:13:10,280 --> 02:13:13,640
I'm sorry. I don't mean it. Look. We got a purple. Uh

1950
02:13:14,520 --> 02:13:17,240
Oh, it's black even though he ate a purple seat. Hello

1951
02:13:18,280 --> 02:13:19,480
Hello

1952
02:13:19,480 --> 02:13:21,480
Oh, he looks pretty cool after that

1953
02:13:21,800 --> 02:13:25,240
I've definitely seen he's purple though. I don't know why I gave him a purple scene

1954
02:13:26,200 --> 02:13:28,440
May sell this tree actually

1955
02:13:29,320 --> 02:13:34,520
Oh, I could probably put some fertilizer on there. Humming is more so good

1956
02:13:34,600 --> 02:13:38,840
Yeah, like clean with your hair humming or something like maybe you're napping on my chest

1957
02:13:39,640 --> 02:13:41,640
And I'm just kind of like

1958
02:13:42,040 --> 02:13:46,680
Well, I wouldn't hum freighter jacko because that would be like why are you singing me straight up lullabies?

1959
02:13:47,640 --> 02:13:49,640
Hmm

1960
02:13:50,040 --> 02:13:52,040
I'd clap to every pinata's name

1961
02:13:52,600 --> 02:14:00,600
Instantly no, I'm not freaking. Oh, they're all coming out now right everyone wake up. It's breeding time wake up breeding time

1962
02:14:00,840 --> 02:14:02,840
breeding time breeding time

1963
02:14:04,040 --> 02:14:08,040
What level are we 18? Oh my gosh, we are living in

1964
02:14:09,800 --> 02:14:16,600
We are leveling up. We are leveling up all the levels all go up

1965
02:14:17,240 --> 02:14:23,720
We are leveling. What is this? Is this an incremental game? I can't believe it. They've got me again. Capitalism's grasp is too good

1966
02:14:25,480 --> 02:14:30,760
Right, okay, we're gonna get these two and then we don't fly on to I know what you're gonna do

1967
02:14:31,080 --> 02:14:36,040
Why are you going back in it's morning? They wake up in the morning. I swear this game hates me

1968
02:14:36,760 --> 02:14:38,760
They wake up in the morning

1969
02:14:39,320 --> 02:14:41,320
Your garden is legal now

1970
02:14:42,920 --> 02:14:45,880
Did you know the age of consent is 16 in the uk rub?

1971
02:14:47,000 --> 02:14:48,040
about

1972
02:14:48,040 --> 02:14:50,040
Make it 18 right now

1973
02:14:51,000 --> 02:14:53,000
Make it 18 right now. That seems really outdated

1974
02:14:53,800 --> 02:14:55,240
mmm

1975
02:14:55,240 --> 02:14:58,600
It's breeding time. Is that a roll call for refling prison?

1976
02:14:58,840 --> 02:15:03,160
Oh, you want a prison scenario that you're in prison and you're like, hey man

1977
02:15:03,960 --> 02:15:06,280
I really need some relief and I'm like

1978
02:15:07,240 --> 02:15:10,360
Refling I can't do that. I'm on the job

1979
02:15:11,800 --> 02:15:13,400
And then you're like

1980
02:15:13,400 --> 02:15:17,160
Oh, oh do me a solid. Please. I'm begging you. I'm begging you

1981
02:15:17,960 --> 02:15:22,200
I'm like, oh fine. You're just got such a way with words refling. I will love it

1982
02:15:23,800 --> 02:15:25,800
It's also 16 in the us

1983
02:15:26,520 --> 02:15:28,520
Oh dear

1984
02:15:32,120 --> 02:15:36,520
Anyway, uh back to the garden yep level whoa, it's so tall

1985
02:15:37,240 --> 02:15:39,240
Oh

02:15:40,840 --> 02:15:42,840
Okay, let's go

1987
02:15:44,840 --> 02:15:49,560
Uh, you also get less lives you actually can't see under the clock that blurry thing

1988
02:15:49,560 --> 02:15:52,600
You see it's supposed to be my lives, but it's not displayed right now

1989
02:15:53,160 --> 02:15:56,840
Um, I don't know why it's not displaying because I've never had any issues

1990
02:15:57,400 --> 02:15:59,720
Like with the actual hard copy of the game

1991
02:16:01,000 --> 02:16:04,040
Okay, the egg is being delivered. We're gonna move it to the side

1992
02:16:04,440 --> 02:16:08,280
But if I'm not mistaken, it should say there's five. Yeah, and there's another egg on the way

1993
02:16:08,360 --> 02:16:11,560
Okay, and then everyone becomes yell right now

1994
02:16:11,640 --> 02:16:16,920
I'm gonna sell this tree because a squazzle hasn't shown up and I'm like, bro. This tree is gonna get old

1995
02:16:18,840 --> 02:16:21,880

2014
02:17:40,120 --> 02:17:43,080
I can't make a parody that's terrible

2015
02:17:44,440 --> 02:17:50,440
Okay, the tree like that good tree. You gave me a little more. Okay, we're gonna get an award for being a master

I am going to sell the house because it's gonna start getting in the way of what we want to do next

2018
02:17:58,520 --> 02:18:01,400
So we're gonna break all of the

We're gonna get the master romance award for the canaries even though we didn't do a single thing for them

2064
02:21:17,640 --> 02:21:19,640
I'm gonna make sure these are okay

2065
02:21:20,200 --> 02:21:24,840
I don't want them to accidentally perish because I put a lot of my stumps in them

2066
02:21:25,560 --> 02:21:31,400
Oh, maybe we can very quickly put fertilizer on this. Jeez the game is working out

2067
02:21:32,760 --> 02:21:37,080
Oh, I think it's kind of funny gardens pretty much just grass dirt and water

2068
02:21:37,560 --> 02:21:38,680
I mean

2069
02:21:38,680 --> 02:21:44,120
Isn't that technically what all gardens are but in a particular way they have to be a particular way or you perish

2070
02:21:44,760 --> 02:21:50,840
Um also reeflings whenever any of my gen mates come online, please do tell me I will tell the

Tell you because because I'm doing endurance stream

2072
02:21:54,280 --> 02:21:58,680
You do not have to feel forced to sit and watch me play a childhood game

2073
02:21:58,680 --> 02:22:03,480
I promise you. Um, I am not insulted at all and I do love when you support my gen mates

2074
02:22:03,480 --> 02:22:05,480

2075
02:22:06,200 --> 02:22:08,760
Head right. We're gonna order two mouse mallows

2076
02:22:10,280 --> 02:22:12,280
And

2077
02:22:12,280 --> 02:22:14,280
And we're gonna put them in a box

2078
02:22:15,080 --> 02:22:17,080
In a box of scraps

2079
02:22:17,080 --> 02:22:18,520
In a cave

2080
02:22:18,760 --> 02:22:22,040
The next time it rains we're definitely gonna do a big ol

2081
02:22:23,400 --> 02:22:25,000
sale

2082
02:22:25,000 --> 02:22:27,880
Because we are very low on money

2083
02:22:30,280 --> 02:22:36,440
I do want to like change I'm gonna keep the canaries because because because because

2084
02:22:36,920 --> 02:22:41,320
And we might be able to get a buzzinge because of it the snakes we need to evolve soon

2085
02:22:41,720 --> 02:22:44,520
I'm gonna keep the flutter scotch because I can make them turn

2086
02:22:45,480 --> 02:22:49,880
A pink the next one's pink and then I think we can fully sell off the flutter scotches

2087
02:22:50,760 --> 02:22:52,920
As we get new white flutter scotches in

2088
02:22:53,960 --> 02:22:55,960
And then we can do the red hots

2089
02:22:57,080 --> 02:22:58,360
Right first

2090
02:22:58,360 --> 02:23:03,640
First mice then red hots and then we'll do our money try and make as much money as possible

2091
02:23:04,600 --> 02:23:06,360
We're trying

2092
02:23:06,360 --> 02:23:08,760
You can't just have candy for a meal

2093
02:23:09,480 --> 02:23:10,760
What are you man?

2094
02:23:10,760 --> 02:23:12,120

02:23:12,200 --> 02:23:15,400
But mom have I grew everything so far?

2096
02:23:15,640 --> 02:23:22,360
You know what? I'm gonna grow toadstool in preparation of a profita a profita roll. You need two

2097
02:23:23,720 --> 02:23:25,720
um of these

2098
02:23:26,760 --> 02:23:28,360
and

2099
02:23:28,360 --> 02:23:34,440
When you to bar on them they become like good toadstools and they don't hurt the piñatas

2100
02:23:34,760 --> 02:23:40,680
And that's what the profita roll mole eats is after a profita roll called a profita mole

2101
02:23:41,240 --> 02:23:43,240
Uh

2102

02:23:47,560 --> 02:23:52,600
Um mouse melon, but I need it. I need it for piñata central because there's an achievement

2104
02:23:53,480 --> 02:23:57,560

2105
02:23:58,200 --> 02:23:59,240

2110
02:24:27,560 --> 02:24:29,560
Uh, I'm thinking

2111
02:24:30,360 --> 02:24:32,360
I'm not thinking too hard though. I'm not very good at that

2112
02:24:33,240 --> 02:24:37,800
A man, I haven't had a profita roll in ages. Am I making you all want sweets playing this game?

2113
02:24:37,880 --> 02:24:40,520

2114
02:24:41,240 --> 02:24:42,920
ages

02:24:42,920 --> 02:24:47,880

2117
02:24:52,680 --> 02:24:57,640
And when you walk through the fire, I will turn you into a red hot in the video game viva piñata

2118
02:24:58,600 --> 02:25:03,800
And the reason I'm saying that it's because if you didn't know there's AI captions on youtube

2119
02:25:04,040 --> 02:25:10,040
And if you upset it too much, it will legit perish your input your unlimited ads

2120
02:25:10,520 --> 02:25:12,520
It's really frustrating honestly

2121
02:25:12,840 --> 02:25:14,360

Shawnee cooked him alive. Literally. It was a barbecue and he got caught in the crossfire

2158
02:27:51,720 --> 02:27:58,920
The game's betraying you by hiding the animation literally. I've never seen such issues before

2159
02:27:59,800 --> 02:28:05,160
But I guess it's because we're streaming to uh, um

2160
02:28:08,120 --> 02:28:15,880
So the way it works, I believe is we're streaming to an xbox right now and the xbox is streaming the game back to us

2161
02:28:16,680 --> 02:28:17,960
um

2162
02:28:17,960 --> 02:28:20,760
Which is like really cool technology if you think about it

2163
02:28:23,400 --> 02:28:26,280
Please tell me we can unlock a cutlass, please

2166
02:28:34,600 --> 02:28:38,600
My garden is improving, but it's improving a bit too fast for me to keep up. I'm not even gonna lie

2167
02:28:39,800 --> 02:28:45,880
It's it's doing it's doing too well. I can hardly keep up with the notifications, right white flotterscotch

2168
02:28:46,840 --> 02:28:48,120

02:28:48,120 --> 02:28:51,160
Please become pink and he went out of bounds

2170
02:28:51,960 --> 02:28:54,600
Right, please stop going out of bounds in my garden. That'd be great

2171
02:28:55,320 --> 02:28:57,320
Please become pink right now

2172
02:28:57,720 --> 02:29:00,920
Oh, we're level 20. Oh

2173
02:29:02,360 --> 02:29:04,860
We've just unlocked a new seed. I don't know what it's gonna be though

2174
02:29:08,760 --> 02:29:13,000
Oh, we can sell uh sparrowman as well for extra money

2175
02:29:15,880 --> 02:29:17,880
Oh

2176
02:29:17,960 --> 02:29:23,400
He's so cute. Oh, I like the eye kind of like the hidden eyes on its wee wings. That's a pretty one

2177
02:29:24,360 --> 02:29:30,600
That'll do it. That'll do it. You are pretty boy. Okay. Um, right. We can now spell sell

2178
02:29:31,800 --> 02:29:38,040
Sparrow mints because they're just like a free income source. I am going to wait for

2179
02:29:40,360 --> 02:29:42,360
What am I gonna wait for

2180
02:29:42,440 --> 02:29:45,720
I think I'm just gonna ask her to catch a tap fly

2181
02:29:46,680 --> 02:29:50,440
Um, and then we'll turn it into a red hot and then I think

2182
02:29:51,160 --> 02:29:56,280
That's the red hot achievement done and then we can sell all of them and that'll be a big money source

2183
02:29:56,840 --> 02:29:58,840
We can start investing

2184
02:29:58,920 --> 02:30:00,360
in stonks

2185
02:30:00,360 --> 02:30:02,360
Not really don't invest in the stock market

2186
02:30:02,920 --> 02:30:07,320
Well, don't listen to me. I ain't qualified in any investment advice, but

2187
02:30:08,360 --> 02:30:15,480
I think investing in people is a good and nice thing to do. I like to think that the girls

2188
02:30:15,960 --> 02:30:21,320
Know that I believe in them and I invest in them and they are doing the best

2189
02:30:22,040 --> 02:30:24,680
That's just me being a simp. So, yeah

2190
02:30:26,600 --> 02:30:28,600
Invest in dealer

2191
02:30:29,000 --> 02:30:31,560

um nine quids

2194
02:30:38,200 --> 02:30:41,000
It always perfectly does it correctly

2195
02:30:41,720 --> 02:30:44,120
Which I love I think is so good. Um

2196
02:30:45,080 --> 02:30:52,200
Oh, we got a bumblebee that I can sell. Is it you? No, it's the other one that's in the garden

2197
02:30:53,000 --> 02:30:54,520

Uh fair gay, we could maybe sell you. I don't normally do anything with fudge hogs

2201
02:31:10,440 --> 02:31:15,400
I don't know. I mean if you guys want to go for a hundred percent encyclopedia

2202
02:31:16,120 --> 02:31:19,400
We could but I'm not sure if that would be so entertaining

2203
02:31:20,760 --> 02:31:22,760
I've never done it before

2204
02:31:24,040 --> 02:31:26,920
Actually, that reminds me. I need to go back and finish slonic heroes

2205
02:31:27,720 --> 02:31:29,720
based on it for playing my childhood game

2206
02:31:31,800 --> 02:31:34,120
Oh my god, what happens if we played our childhood games together

2207
02:31:34,440 --> 02:31:38,360
And then you told me about your childhood games and I played them on stream for the first time

2208
02:31:38,360 --> 02:31:42,120
And then I reviewed them and then you can have a nostalgia trip and I can have a nostalgia trip

2209
02:31:42,120 --> 02:31:44,120
And we can all just have fun together and have a really good time

2210
02:31:49,800 --> 02:31:56,520
Okay, one taff like so we need one more taff like because one of them got eaten by a frog

They turned the freaking frogs. Okay, boom

02:32:05,320 --> 02:32:07,320

Make sure to keep the square of hard dirt for the dragon to make it golden golden brown

2263
02:36:21,160 --> 02:36:23,160
textures like sun

2264

Oh, it was a mouse. Okay. That's fine. We actually need two mice

a house for the serpents

2271
02:36:56,200 --> 02:36:58,200
Because we do want them to hump

2272
02:37:02,920 --> 02:37:07,720
A serpent home, sorry, I could not for the life of me see that I was having to go through it

2273
02:37:08,680 --> 02:37:13,480
We've gone through it for real for real. Okay, boom. We'll just put it over here. Wait. No, we won't because there's something in the way

2274
02:37:13,480 --> 02:37:15,480
I don't know what's in the way, but I put it there anyway

2275
02:37:17,240 --> 02:37:22,520
Uh, have you considered adding chat sends like if I set number of people use the lap and won't attract please?

2276
02:37:22,600 --> 02:37:25,960
I don't actually know what that is. I'm so sorry

2277
02:37:27,000 --> 02:37:33,560
I've never heard of that. Is it youtube compatible a lot of integration is like twitch only because youtube's api

2278
02:37:33,880 --> 02:37:35,480
Is slightly behind

2279
02:37:35,480 --> 02:37:42,920
But I have faith youtube is gonna get there unironically if you look at like every year how streaming has improved on youtube I

2280
02:37:44,840 --> 02:37:50,040
Gonna be controversial and say that they're just better right now for any streamer

2281
02:37:50,600 --> 02:37:53,960
Um, like twitch is cut for subs is like

2282
02:37:54,840 --> 02:37:56,840
Oh, we can sell you

2283
02:37:57,320 --> 02:37:59,320
It's old gets old gets old home

2284
02:38:00,360 --> 02:38:02,360
I think there is a taffy as well

2285
02:38:03,880 --> 02:38:05,880
God, they're all buzzing about

2286
02:38:06,680 --> 02:38:08,680
You can hear them

2287
02:38:08,680 --> 02:38:12,680
Oh, there's a profanum rule. Oh, hi. Hi seedos. Give me a new seed, please

2288
02:38:15,000 --> 02:38:17,000
Yes, you can

2289
02:38:19,640 --> 02:38:25,320
Sunflower seeds are a great source of something. I don't know what but they're oh tilly seed. Thank you for free money

2290
02:38:26,120 --> 02:38:30,200
Oh, right. You're only giving me one today. Jeez talk about being a stingy

2291
02:38:30,600 --> 02:38:32,600
bastard

2292
02:38:32,840 --> 02:38:38,520
I hope they accept other payment methods for membership or chat because only credit is raw

2293
02:38:39,400 --> 02:38:45,240
Wait, did they not accept debit cards? Ah, I gifted a red flutter scotch

2294
02:38:47,320 --> 02:38:54,200
Well, you're lucky. I even have one in here somewhere. There it is. Well, your days are numbered little guy

2295
02:38:54,760 --> 02:38:56,760
I

2296
02:38:57,320 --> 02:39:01,720
Pave a debit card. I gifted memberships to she be when um, the

2297
02:39:04,440 --> 02:39:07,160
Herum were given like tons in a row

2298
02:39:08,040 --> 02:39:09,640
and

2299
02:39:09,640 --> 02:39:11,640
I just saw that can you oh

2300
02:39:11,720 --> 02:39:17,640
What is that? I saw that it was something. Oh, I was like in the pond. I don't know if you can see on screen

2301
02:39:18,440 --> 02:39:20,040
maybe

2302
02:39:20,040 --> 02:39:24,120
Why are you? Why are you drowning? You're swimming in that water?

2303
02:39:25,160 --> 02:39:27,160
What's bouncing?

2304
02:39:29,160 --> 02:39:33,960
Uh, I don't know. Maybe it's getting old. Oh, well that flutter just got glitched out. I can see it

2305
02:39:37,080 --> 02:39:39,080
Aw, gamy sleeps so peacefully

2306
02:39:42,120 --> 02:39:47,720
And it depends what country you live in the world is unfolding. Oh no, I can use PayPal. Yeah, let me use PayPal for me

2307
02:39:49,000 --> 02:39:52,280
Oh, we're gonna sell him for a little bit money. Oh, he's doing it

2308
02:39:53,000 --> 02:39:55,000
He's being so sneaky

2309
02:39:55,320 --> 02:39:57,320
Oh, he was rubbish

2310
02:39:57,400 --> 02:40:03,080
Wait, why are you randomly attacking my flowers? Don't do such things. That's stinky

2311
02:40:04,920 --> 02:40:06,920
You'll be a stinky boy

2312
02:40:07,480 --> 02:40:09,480
I know you can be a good boy

2313
02:40:10,600 --> 02:40:15,320
Oh, and I'm killing my trees. Hold on. I've not even grown them properly yet. Hold on. Hold on

2314
02:40:16,360 --> 02:40:18,360
Bear with me bear with me

2315
02:40:19,160 --> 02:40:22,120
Okay, you better be a hunter a better hunter than my friend

2316
02:40:23,080 --> 02:40:26,360
You may just have to set it up through your google account rather than youtube

2317
02:40:27,640 --> 02:40:30,440
What's that more private personally? Oh

2318
02:40:34,520 --> 02:40:38,600
Not main I meant from the corporation's point of view. Sorry

2319
02:40:40,360 --> 02:40:42,920
I'm afraid I am sad to report

2320
02:40:43,800 --> 02:40:45,800
I can't show up to your house just yet

2321
02:40:45,880 --> 02:40:47,160
But soon

2322
02:40:47,160 --> 02:40:48,360
soon

2323
02:40:48,360 --> 02:40:50,120
um

2324
02:40:50,120 --> 02:40:54,920
Yes, I also did my research on voice packs yesterday on how

2325
02:40:55,560 --> 02:40:58,600
VTuber agencies offer voice packs

2326
02:40:59,480 --> 02:41:05,640
So I didn't actually know what it was like or what they do or how big it is or how short it is

2327
02:41:07,000 --> 02:41:11,160
But um, I got some information divulged to me. Um

2328
02:41:11,880 --> 02:41:16,520
So I will work on Azur's voice pack with her for her donathon

2329
02:41:17,240 --> 02:41:18,760
um

2330
02:41:18,760 --> 02:41:24,600
I just need to work on the tears. So what we're going to do is I'm going to propose what she does

2331
02:41:25,320 --> 02:41:28,040
She's going to show it on stream. Oh

2332
02:41:29,640 --> 02:41:31,640
You know you such a good boy now. Oh

2333
02:41:32,360 --> 02:41:34,360
That thing popped

2334
02:41:35,160 --> 02:41:40,280
Can't pay with PayPal on computer but can on youtube app, but iOS takes 30% that's insane

2335
02:41:41,560 --> 02:41:43,560
I think wasn't there

2336
02:41:44,280 --> 02:41:50,200
Oh, it was oh my god, that's so cute. Oh my god

2337
02:41:52,120 --> 02:41:55,640
I fucking love it. I fucking love it. It's getting named

2338
02:41:56,920 --> 02:41:59,880
Profita moling. I know you're supposed to drop the e

2339
02:42:00,440 --> 02:42:03,640
Was it i before e unless it's something something but no

2340
02:42:06,200 --> 02:42:08,840
What the fuck look at the way it moves

2341
02:42:09,560 --> 02:42:15,640
A profita mol gen 2 girl confirmed because oh my god, I love it. It's so cute

2342
02:42:17,160 --> 02:42:23,320
Okay, what do you need? You need to eat licorice. I'm not ready for you to do that yet. Okay

2343
02:42:25,400 --> 02:42:27,640
Uh, I guess we don't need the mushrooms

2344
02:42:28,360 --> 02:42:32,760
Wait, it didn't eat the mushrooms. It just wanted two of them in the garden

2345
02:42:33,960 --> 02:42:35,960
That's very specific

2346
02:42:36,600 --> 02:42:38,600
Oh, it's a monkey

2347
02:42:39,560 --> 02:42:41,560
I love my moon

2348
02:42:41,800 --> 02:42:43,800
Look a new kweefling. No

2349
02:42:43,800 --> 02:42:45,640
No

2350
02:42:45,640 --> 02:42:48,040
We are not doing kweefling. Okay

2351
02:42:51,400 --> 02:42:54,040
A pinata vtuber is something I haven't heard of before

2352
02:42:55,400 --> 02:42:57,400
um

2353
02:42:57,800 --> 02:42:59,800
Maybe gen three should be

2354
02:43:00,440 --> 02:43:04,040
Uh stuff that hasn't been done before that would be an interesting concept

2355
02:43:05,000 --> 02:43:07,000
I don't know

2356
02:43:07,320 --> 02:43:10,840
Oh my god strona, you've now made it to the two month mark and you're already talking about gen three

2357
02:43:11,400 --> 02:43:12,600
brov

2358
02:43:12,600 --> 02:43:19,640
Brov it takes so long to plan this stuff behind the scenes. Please relax. Okay, please relax. It takes years

2359
02:43:19,720 --> 02:43:26,920
It takes small. That was a big glitch there. It relax. It's not that serious. Okay. Goodbye. Mr. Tafly. I don't need you right now

2360
02:43:27,880 --> 02:43:32,520
Okay, we're starting to get our money up a bit. This is good. I'm needing a rainy night and I need to do the

2361
02:43:34,040 --> 02:43:40,120
Or I need to unlock the flowers actually if I can unlock more. I a monkey. I'm finally in the game

2362
02:43:40,600 --> 02:43:45,240
Do you what what viva pinata? Do you identify as

2363
02:43:45,960 --> 02:43:47,240
monkey

2364
02:43:47,240 --> 02:43:49,800
I if I had to pick a pinata

2365
02:43:50,760 --> 02:43:54,200
I want to be like, oh, I'd be like a cool mysterious one

2366
02:43:54,360 --> 02:43:59,800
But to be honest, I'm probably gonna be a jameleon because I'm silly and I like a bright colors

2367
02:44:00,760 --> 02:44:06,280
Oh, no, the watercress popped its clogs. Well, you've done me a great service, mister. Oh

2368
02:44:07,480 --> 02:44:10,760
Well, I might as well sell the watercress head

2369
02:44:11,320 --> 02:44:14,440
Because you get more money for that. Are you just floating on the water?

2370
02:44:15,720 --> 02:44:22,120
Wait, the cinema key is already in my garden. Wait, hold on. You just caught here. You are monkey nuts

2371
02:44:22,920 --> 02:44:25,400
I'm gonna have to buy monkey nuts to try and get them

2372
02:44:26,360 --> 02:44:32,200
I have to admit my luck in this game has been really good. Sometimes the AI like refuses to work with you and

2373
02:44:33,000 --> 02:44:40,120
Pinatas that come into your garden will like straight up ignore you. Grab us that one two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. Go

2374
02:44:40,840 --> 02:44:42,840
Inhale them all

2375
02:44:44,520 --> 02:44:49,080
Oh my god, beaver vtuber confirmed

2376
02:44:50,040 --> 02:44:52,040
I can't handle this

2377
02:44:52,040 --> 02:44:54,040
My heart's gonna explode

2378
02:44:55,400 --> 02:44:57,400
My heart is gonna explode

2379
02:44:58,840 --> 02:45:02,680
There is a pink pinata. Yes. Are you a hungry refling?

2380
02:45:03,880 --> 02:45:05,400
I can feed you

2381
02:45:05,400 --> 02:45:08,680
We're level 22. We're doing it. We're doing it. We're doing it. Oh my god. He had one

2382
02:45:09,320 --> 02:45:13,160
Okay, I want to see all seven of these monkey nuts going. Do I make myself clear AI?

2383
02:45:15,400 --> 02:45:17,880
Uh, I'm actually gonna check my book

2384
02:45:19,480 --> 02:45:21,480
Because that buzzing

2385
02:45:22,280 --> 02:45:24,280
hasn't come back

2386
02:45:25,080 --> 02:45:27,480
To eat the rip. No, not that one. Sorry

2387
02:45:27,880 --> 02:45:29,000
uh

2388
02:45:29,000 --> 02:45:30,440
player award

2389
02:45:30,440 --> 02:45:32,440
for the pinatas

2390
02:45:33,480 --> 02:45:36,840
That buzzing never came back and I don't know why

2391
02:45:37,560 --> 02:45:41,240
I might be a requirement of the garden for him to show up and do something

2392
02:45:43,560 --> 02:45:46,060
I'm looking I'm looking

2393
02:45:47,020 --> 02:45:49,020
Oh

2394
02:45:49,580 --> 02:45:57,020
There he is. Sorry. Sorry. Oh a cinemunkey's level seven. We actually want the cinemunkey. Jeez. We're already blasting into the sevens

2395
02:45:57,900 --> 02:46:00,780
Right buzzing. What is your show up requirements?

2396
02:46:01,420 --> 02:46:03,580
Have five canaries in the garden

2397
02:46:05,580 --> 02:46:07,420
Okay

2398
02:46:07,420 --> 02:46:13,900
I'm like 99 sure he only ate two hold on where's a buzzing when you need one because if he ate three he would have been mine

2399
02:46:14,060 --> 02:46:15,900
Yeah, he's got six

2400
02:46:16,620 --> 02:46:22,780
I guess that the game's trying to give us the new pinatas that have also been unlocked. That's the only thing about

2401
02:46:23,820 --> 02:46:28,700
The game it can only spawn in so many pinatas that are interested in your garden. So we've got

2402
02:46:29,340 --> 02:46:33,260
Like a licotode coming in right now. So it won't spawn like another one

2403
02:46:33,260 --> 02:46:38,540
There's only a set amount and I think the buzzing isn't being spawned in right now. Oh

2404
02:46:39,740 --> 02:46:41,580
I spoke too soon

2405
02:46:41,580 --> 02:46:46,220
It's gonna be a massacre, but I'm gonna get a buzz inch from it. It's gonna be a

2406
02:46:47,020 --> 02:46:49,020
murder on the dance floor

2407
02:46:50,060 --> 02:46:52,060
You better not get in the way

2408
02:46:52,940 --> 02:46:55,980
Any other pinata? I want this buzzing. I want it

2409
02:47:00,140 --> 02:47:02,140
Golem time golem time

2410
02:47:02,140 --> 02:47:07,900
How many monkey knots four get eaten. This is a mukbang turn around and eat the other four

2411
02:47:07,980 --> 02:47:09,980
I want to see you gain weight

2412
02:47:10,380 --> 02:47:15,180
I want to see you struggle to eat that last piece and say I'm full and then continue

2413
02:47:15,580 --> 02:47:18,300
That's what really gets my rocks off. Keep eating

2414
02:47:19,580 --> 02:47:21,580
actual mukbang for real

2415
02:47:23,260 --> 02:47:25,260
Gonna burn this goddamn health and red

2416
02:47:27,900 --> 02:47:29,900
You may not be a girl

2417
02:47:31,340 --> 02:47:33,340
Her architect how dare you

2418
02:47:33,980 --> 02:47:38,860
Okay, is that three? No, so there's one more eat one more. I double dog dare you

2419
02:47:38,940 --> 02:47:41,340
I double donut dog dare you eat one more

2420
02:47:42,220 --> 02:47:44,220
now

2421
02:47:44,300 --> 02:47:49,340
Right the second so I can collect that juicy xp when you become a part of my garden. Do I make myself clear?

2422
02:47:50,780 --> 02:47:52,780
Can you do that for me little buzz inch?

2423
02:47:56,460 --> 02:47:58,460
Go attack someone right now

2424
02:47:59,420 --> 02:48:05,580
Look, there's so many and the monkey's walking away from the peanuts. Yes, AI you better kick in and turn back

2425
02:48:05,980 --> 02:48:12,780
Turn that butt around and eat those peanuts. Do you understand me? We didn't unlock and you see even the light leveled up

2426
02:48:14,700 --> 02:48:17,980
Lawy you're making me work for you. I want it

2427
02:48:19,260 --> 02:48:25,900
And he's not locked the gem seat either. Okay. We're probably gonna do petulia next if I can get this cinamonky

2428
02:48:26,300 --> 02:48:30,220
And this buzz inch to perish one more

2429
02:48:30,860 --> 02:48:32,860
We might have two new

2430
02:48:33,420 --> 02:48:38,220
Residents which might push us to the next level, which is what I'm wanting. I really want to start the

2431
02:48:39,100 --> 02:48:43,660
Flower farming because that's like really you make a lot of money a lot a lot of money

2432
02:48:44,540 --> 02:48:48,700
What's that? We're talking capitalistic strategies and a child's video game about a garden. Yes

2433
02:48:50,860 --> 02:48:54,700
Okay, maybe you'll give me a new seed seed us

2434
02:48:55,100 --> 02:48:58,860
I can identify every kind of seed with my eyes closed

2435
02:48:59,260 --> 02:49:01,260
Just by touching them with

2436
02:49:01,340 --> 02:49:03,340
With mine and your nose

2437
02:49:03,900 --> 02:49:07,260
What's that? That's a sunflower seed. I don't need a sunflower

2438
02:49:07,980 --> 02:49:09,980
Yeah, bam. What else can you give me?

2439
02:49:10,540 --> 02:49:12,540
I don't think you want

2440
02:49:13,100 --> 02:49:16,300
You should have seen me two days ago had pizza for lunch three days in a row

2441
02:49:16,860 --> 02:49:19,980
I was feeling very sick. But how else am I gonna get fat for you real?

2442
02:49:20,780 --> 02:49:23,340
Real how else are you gonna get a big tum tum?

2443
02:49:24,700 --> 02:49:27,100
Real true based. I don't care what anyone says

2444
02:49:27,340 --> 02:49:29,340
Oh

2445
02:49:29,660 --> 02:49:35,340
Actually a reflin sent me a marrow and they were like, oh, I'm losing weight because it's not healthy for me

2446
02:49:35,660 --> 02:49:37,660
Now, I don't want you to be unhealthy

2447
02:49:37,900 --> 02:49:42,860
I just want you to have some trouble on you so I can like jiggle it around and I can feed you and stuff

2448
02:49:43,340 --> 02:49:48,780
But I don't want you to be unhealthy. But to the refling that sent that marrow about getting your health together

2449
02:49:48,940 --> 02:49:53,660
I'm very proud of you. I know deep down inside. You can do it. It is very hard

2450
02:49:54,220 --> 02:49:59,820
But once you get into the rhythm you get you'll get there. So please don't worry. Have faith in yourself

2451
02:50:00,540 --> 02:50:03,660
It's a scary journey sometimes as well because hunger

2452
02:50:04,540 --> 02:50:11,100
Literally kicks your brain into overdrive and makes like your body be like no, no, no. I need this now. No, no

2461
02:50:46,860 --> 02:50:51,420
I'm a scrawny guy, but I got a bit of a belly. Am I handsome enough for mama?

2462
02:50:51,980 --> 02:50:52,780
naturally

2463
02:50:52,780 --> 02:50:59,580
I like the idea of like jiggling your belly and feeding you and then it's like, oh, what's for dinner?

2464
02:50:59,900 --> 02:51:05,820
And then I go take away and then I feed you and and then you order your like main meal

2465
02:51:06,140 --> 02:51:09,500
And I'm like, okay, but what side are you gonna get refling?

2466
02:51:10,060 --> 02:51:15,020
What side are you gonna get and then I'll be like, oh what drink do you want a milkshake for no particular reason other than

2467
02:51:15,100 --> 02:51:16,620
the most calorific

2468
02:51:16,620 --> 02:51:17,900
dense drink

2469
02:51:17,900 --> 02:51:21,660
Well, you don't need a diet cola refling. Don't be silly

2470
02:51:22,380 --> 02:51:23,980
come on

2471
02:51:23,980 --> 02:51:27,580
Shawnee wants us to be so big that we need to depend on her to survive

2472
02:51:28,780 --> 02:51:30,060
No

2473
02:51:30,060 --> 02:51:34,300

2477
02:51:45,740 --> 02:51:47,900
Watching you grow bigger alongside me

2478
02:51:49,260 --> 02:51:51,420
Watching you stuff your face next to me

2479
02:51:54,140 --> 02:51:58,140
Okay, I can't talk about it too long because I can I can like kind of imagine it and I like

Shawnee can't it be mutual? No, I like my small boobies

2484
02:52:12,780 --> 02:52:14,780
I don't want big boobies

2485
02:52:14,940 --> 02:52:17,660
And if I put weight on I'll get boobies and I don't want boobies

2486
02:52:17,900 --> 02:52:21,100
Mama can feed me all she wants, but she better be dessert

2487
02:52:21,340 --> 02:52:22,540

2491
02:52:36,540 --> 02:52:38,540

But if you didn't know back in you old days before baby mash food and mash blenders and all that

2508
02:53:48,380 --> 02:53:52,460
Um, it's really common for your mum to chew the food for you and then put it in your mouth

2509
02:53:52,620 --> 02:53:54,620
Like like spittle it into your mouth

2510
02:53:55,260 --> 02:53:58,380
And it's actually good for the baby because it helps with um

2511
02:53:59,340 --> 02:54:03,020
Digestion if mum is the dessert. I want to put the icing on her cakes

2512

2566
02:58:24,140 --> 02:58:30,380
I thought they were going to be worth way more. He literally destroyed how many birds and he was worth 2000

2567
02:58:31,820 --> 02:58:35,500
Rubbish anyway, right. I'm going to sell the birds. I'm going to sell the hops culture

2568
02:58:36,940 --> 02:58:38,940

2570
02:58:48,540 --> 02:58:51,740
Um, because we're about to do a message

2571
02:58:53,820 --> 02:58:54,860
Of

a misunderstanding um

2574
02:59:03,020 --> 02:59:08,140
Things that reflings are telling me because I'm dumb, but like a good dumb not the bad kind

2575
02:59:09,020 --> 02:59:11,020

What was the plan about? I've already forgot. I she forgot um, um

2578

Okay, so we got the buzz inch. We want that monkey to show up. Where is he?

2579
02:59:23,340 --> 02:59:25,580
Does he live over here in the forest?

2580
02:59:26,540 --> 02:59:34,140
Oh, wait, no, doesn't he climb down? Oh, he climbs down from that hot thing up there. I think or maybe not. Oh, I can't recall

2581
02:59:36,140 --> 02:59:38,380

2599
03:00:54,060 --> 03:00:56,300
You can't prove it. Why did I hear dinning?

2600
03:00:58,060 --> 03:01:02,300
Am I going crazy? Did I not just hear dinning? Is there something bad in the garden right now?

2601
03:01:05,740 --> 03:01:14,060
I sounded like the sweet played so close you should have should have said in your bush. Eh, I had a bath. Sorry. Look, I'm not being funny

2602
03:01:14,860 --> 03:01:16,860
Just just to prove it

2603
03:01:17,900 --> 03:01:23,900
See how there was see how there was no muffling or anything. Yeah, I had a bath

2604
03:01:25,900 --> 03:01:27,420
I had a bath

2605
03:01:27,420 --> 03:01:30,940
Um, I'm hairless. I'm literally a hairless cat. Okay

2606
03:01:35,180 --> 03:01:39,100
There's not any hair on my body right now other than my head and my roof

2607
03:01:40,300 --> 03:01:45,660
You know, I could have sworn I heard a bad sweet sound, but I guess not

2608
03:01:46,620 --> 03:01:50,860
All right, get rid of the red hawks. You're the red hawks are miserable. Honestly

2609
03:01:52,300 --> 03:01:55,500
Sell that and that and that. Okay

2610
03:01:57,100 --> 03:01:59,100
Oh no

2611
03:02:00,940 --> 03:02:08,300
I knew I heard the doonan. Oh my god, you're being so dramatic though. Look at the way he's like floating in the water

2612
03:02:09,340 --> 03:02:11,340
It's okay. You'll be fine

2613
03:02:11,340 --> 03:02:15,340
Even though you're right outside his house, which is really dangerous if we don't get there in time

2614
03:02:15,980 --> 03:02:18,780
Thank you, mr. Shelly Bean. I will sell you

2615
03:02:19,580 --> 03:02:21,420
Thank you

2616
03:02:21,420 --> 03:02:23,420
Okay, we got the liquid to it

2617
03:02:23,820 --> 03:02:28,300
So you have a smoothie of clam helia. Oh dear. Don't say such things. Oh god my tentacle

2618
03:02:32,540 --> 03:02:34,540
Wow

2619
03:02:36,300 --> 03:02:44,300
Brian, you must be a top tier gardening tool cause you're my favorite. Oh, okay. That was a good one. That was a good one

2620
03:02:46,220 --> 03:02:48,940
That was a classic. Thank you. Kaidon

2621
03:02:49,660 --> 03:02:55,180
That was a good one. I'll give you that. That's a classic. Come on. That's a classic. You can't you can't say no to that, right? You

2622
03:02:56,300 --> 03:02:58,300
You two are gonna hump. Okay

2623
03:03:01,180 --> 03:03:05,020
Okay, you're gonna hump and then we are going to

2624
03:03:06,300 --> 03:03:11,580
Watch the egg and as the egg hatches, we're gonna beat it. Okay. I know that sounds bizarre

2625
03:03:11,660 --> 03:03:14,540
Why would you want to beat an egg from a piñata that's hatching?

2626
03:03:15,100 --> 03:03:17,980
Trust the process. Okay. Trust the process

2627
03:03:19,660 --> 03:03:23,340
You have faith in me, right? You trust me. I said hump

2628
03:03:24,380 --> 03:03:28,860
I said hump. Did I not want to make myself clear hump right now right in front of me

2629
03:03:32,940 --> 03:03:34,940
Oh you

2630
03:03:35,900 --> 03:03:38,940
Whoa, we got 20,000 coins. That's so good

2631
03:03:39,500 --> 03:03:41,180
Oh

2632
03:03:41,180 --> 03:03:42,060
Are you squinting me?

2633
03:03:42,060 --> 03:03:44,220
Sean, you're like the most beautiful fields for all

2634
03:03:44,220 --> 03:03:47,820
Hi, strongies. Well, uh, Brian. Are you gonna do another fitness stream again?

2635
03:03:48,060 --> 03:03:53,820
Yeah, maybe you should partake in some yoga. Don't worry. I'll stretch you out nice and good

2636
03:03:54,940 --> 03:03:57,660
I genuinely wholeheartedly thought you were

2637
03:03:58,140 --> 03:04:02,220
Wanting another fitness stream and I was like, yeah, of course a bit. Okay. You got me. You win

2638
03:04:02,940 --> 03:04:05,420
You win. You got me. Thank you anonymous

2639
03:04:06,300 --> 03:04:11,020
Genuinely got me there. I was like, yeah, of course. We'll do another ring fit stream. That was so fun

2640
03:04:11,180 --> 03:04:13,180
I just won't overdo it too much this time

2641
03:04:13,980 --> 03:04:17,820
Someone pointed out they were like strongy. You're on hard mode and I'm like, oh

2642
03:04:18,940 --> 03:04:21,020
That might explain a few things. Yes

2643
03:04:21,900 --> 03:04:23,500
um

2644
03:04:23,500 --> 03:04:29,420
I've been very silly about uh, yeah, apparently I was on hard mode. So I'm gonna next time we play. We're not going to be on hard mode

2645
03:04:29,420 --> 03:04:30,460
Okay

2646
03:04:30,460 --> 03:04:33,340
Hey, let's go for another actually fitness stream

2647
03:04:34,300 --> 03:04:39,980
Thank you and on for being 15 reminder that snakes have to be what I didn't know that

2648
03:04:41,660 --> 03:04:45,020
Huh, that's rather odd. Oh, we get the romance

2649
03:04:46,540 --> 03:04:51,260
Oh my god, it's hypnosis. Oh, uh, this is a pinot. I would be are you ready?

2650
03:04:55,260 --> 03:04:57,260
Wait, I thought

2651
03:04:57,580 --> 03:04:59,580
Is it the other ones that are hypnosis?

2652
03:05:00,140 --> 03:05:02,140
I

2653
03:05:02,540 --> 03:05:05,420
Could have sworn the snakes were hypnosis. Maybe I'm making that up

2654
03:05:06,780 --> 03:05:09,420
It's a serpent like serpent

2655
03:05:10,300 --> 03:05:14,060
Want to come to my place and watch corn on my 52 inch mirror

2656
03:05:15,260 --> 03:05:23,020
We have a 52 inch mirror. Wait mirror. Oh, it's not okay. I get it. I get it. I get it. I was like

2657
03:05:24,060 --> 03:05:28,700
I was gonna say you have a 52 inch tv screen and then it was a mirror. Okay. That was good

2658
03:05:29,980 --> 03:05:32,060
Thank you for the tip. That was actually really good

2659
03:05:32,940 --> 03:05:34,940
Holy crap

2660
03:05:35,820 --> 03:05:37,820
I like the way you keep trying

2661
03:05:37,980 --> 03:05:40,620
Even though you don't have the natural talent that I did

2662
03:05:41,260 --> 03:05:48,860
Your shovel is even stronger now. We're salty old man. You can't use it properly or you could end up breaking something important

2663
03:05:49,740 --> 03:05:53,580
We're salty old man. I'm sorry to say it old man, but you're dust

2664
03:05:54,140 --> 03:05:56,140
like too

2665
03:05:56,460 --> 03:06:01,260
Um snakes often look like they're fighting when they mate. Wait, is that right? I didn't know that

2666
03:06:01,980 --> 03:06:03,980
Yes, I got my comeback

2667
03:06:06,060 --> 03:06:13,340
Can you beat the evil people with the shovel? No, you can't there's no way you can prevent Dastardos other than the

2668
03:06:14,300 --> 03:06:18,780
Sour pinatas, right? I am going to aimbot this guy right here

2669
03:06:20,460 --> 03:06:24,460
Do not look away when he's ready to hatch we give him one big whack. Okay

2670
03:06:25,180 --> 03:06:27,180
Snakes can mate for many hours

2671
03:06:27,660 --> 03:06:29,340
What why is it?

2672
03:06:29,340 --> 03:06:31,820
I feel like in nature. It's like so quick

2673
03:06:32,780 --> 03:06:38,220
Like whenever you see like a documentary it's like boom it's over and like if you've ever seen the way fish do it

2674
03:06:38,780 --> 03:06:40,780
Fish are literally Hail Marion

2675
03:06:41,660 --> 03:06:45,180
The female and the male will go side by side as fish

2676
03:06:45,580 --> 03:06:49,980
And then the female releases the eggs and the the male releases the ink at the same time

2677
03:06:50,220 --> 03:06:54,540
And then they just hope that it works via water. It's insane. Honestly

2678
03:06:55,580 --> 03:07:02,380
Um, it's quite funny, but I mean, you know, evolution will find a way. Whoa. Look at the yellow guy

2679
03:07:02,540 --> 03:07:04,860
He's actually really cute. I like his pattern type

2680
03:07:06,060 --> 03:07:09,980
Nature comes in two forms. Wham, bam. Thank you, ma'am or four hours later

2681
03:07:10,620 --> 03:07:12,860
Some species also have huge snakes

2682
03:07:13,420 --> 03:07:15,420
Oh

2683
03:07:15,740 --> 03:07:18,060
Well, we're getting educated in this stream getting

2684
03:07:18,620 --> 03:07:23,820
This game with no, no, no, no, no, no, no in the middle of the egg growing

2685
03:07:23,980 --> 03:07:29,500
Please I hope the garden's paused. What do you need? I think he needs five

2686
03:07:30,300 --> 03:07:32,300
romance

2687
03:07:32,620 --> 03:07:33,580
Five

2688
03:07:33,580 --> 03:07:35,740
pinata romance things I think

2689
03:07:38,700 --> 03:07:42,460
Okay, we did it. Oh my god, we did it. That was the worst timing

2690
03:07:43,660 --> 03:07:46,140
That couldn't have gone any worse

2691
03:07:47,820 --> 03:07:50,700
Don't ever do that to me again

2692
03:07:52,380 --> 03:07:54,140
Oh my goodness

2693
03:07:54,140 --> 03:07:59,660
I had a heart attack. I knew that was coming. I knew that timing was awful. Right, we're gonna make

2694
03:08:01,260 --> 03:08:05,100
We actually can't go to the next one. So I'm gonna sell the serpent

2695
03:08:05,420 --> 03:08:10,460
So I know they just like had a child and stuff, but it's time to go the banks are winning this one

2696
03:08:11,420 --> 03:08:13,420
That's terrible. Don't stop joking about that

2697
03:08:14,220 --> 03:08:16,220
Well, actually, you know what?

2698
03:08:16,620 --> 03:08:21,100
Sorry, but as commoners unironically have to make jokes about it as if like it makes anyone happy

2699
03:08:21,340 --> 03:08:27,260
That the fucking banks get to win everything. So I was I'm going on around again. So stop. Stop. Stop. It's Johnny. I can't help it. Okay

2700
03:08:28,300 --> 03:08:30,300
Something's annoying me

2701
03:08:31,020 --> 03:08:33,580
And I oh no, I've gone the wrong place now

2702
03:08:34,700 --> 03:08:39,500
I'm getting so distracted. Right. Hold on. Let me focus up. What what's up, Johnny?

2703
03:08:39,740 --> 03:08:41,740
Uh, viva pinata

2704
03:08:42,380 --> 03:08:45,500
Oh, she's actually hosting a sale for once. Thank you

2705
03:08:47,260 --> 03:08:51,180
Oh, we got a nightshade seed these take forever to grow

2706
03:08:51,660 --> 03:08:54,460
So we're just gonna plant it let her do its thing

2707
03:08:55,660 --> 03:08:58,540
It we are gonna do the chili myth

2708
03:08:59,900 --> 03:09:01,900
Do we need to do it? I mean we have a lot

2709
03:09:02,540 --> 03:09:04,540
You know what? No

2710
03:09:04,860 --> 03:09:06,860
We're not gonna do the chili method

2711
03:09:07,420 --> 03:09:09,420
What we're gonna do right now

2712
03:09:09,900 --> 03:09:11,900
is

2713
03:09:11,900 --> 03:09:13,900
Be good boys and girls

2714
03:09:14,220 --> 03:09:17,260
And we're gonna do the pitch

2715
03:09:17,820 --> 03:09:23,020
In your method. What's your name paper pits? Well, no, that's not your actual name. What's your name again?

2716
03:09:23,100 --> 03:09:28,620
Oh, you startled me. No, I wasn't sleeping on the job. That's not a bad idea

2717
03:09:28,860 --> 03:09:30,860
She's actually a nick of each of you

2718
03:09:31,420 --> 03:09:33,420
Uh, right. Okay

2719
03:09:34,300 --> 03:09:36,300
We are gonna get

2720
03:09:37,100 --> 03:09:38,700
seven

2721
03:09:38,780 --> 03:09:40,780
Chickens, okay

2722
03:09:43,180 --> 03:09:46,060
And then we're gonna get an award for master romancing them

2723
03:09:47,260 --> 03:09:51,740
See just like that. We didn't even do anything. They just showed up in the garden another here

2724
03:09:53,820 --> 03:09:55,820
Look at them

2725
03:09:57,900 --> 03:10:01,900
And then we got an award for having them as residents and then next

2726
03:10:02,700 --> 03:10:06,860
We're gonna sell them. We're gonna sell five of them and then we're gonna make them hump

2727
03:10:07,660 --> 03:10:13,180
And just like that you get insane xp. You can do that with all of the paper pits in her shop

2728
03:10:13,260 --> 03:10:16,060
Okay, this is how you throw yourself ahead with xp

2729
03:10:16,860 --> 03:10:19,500
Now with a cluckle, there's a secret achievement

2730
03:10:20,060 --> 03:10:23,100
Um, where if they hatch an egg

2731
03:10:23,980 --> 03:10:29,900
They give you an achievement. Okay, so we are gonna make them kiss. Okay, so we need corn

2732
03:10:30,700 --> 03:10:32,700
Which is fine with me. It's calm

2733
03:10:34,060 --> 03:10:36,700
Speaking of food items, I'm actually getting

2734
03:10:37,020 --> 03:10:40,060
A bit peckish. Do we need to get some food in us riefling?

2735
03:10:42,060 --> 03:10:45,820
And I need to I've no said hydration check. I hope you guys are hydrating as well

2736
03:10:45,900 --> 03:10:48,540
I've been hydrating via a can of cola. So that doesn't count

2737
03:10:49,900 --> 03:10:56,060
That doesn't count. I've not been doing very well in the the older cola. Um, who where's that bumblebee?

2738
03:10:57,100 --> 03:11:04,780
Sweet little bumblebee. Give me a thousand chocolate coins. Oh, I'm rich and I've fallen down the capitalism pipeline

2739
03:11:05,180 --> 03:11:10,140
There you are. Thank you for the thousand. You will help us with future endeavors. Amen. Um

2740
03:11:13,180 --> 03:11:17,340
Once those corn grow, I can't remember what else the chickens need

2741
03:11:18,300 --> 03:11:21,340
A bit peckish just after getting chicken. Stop. I love chicken

2742
03:11:21,500 --> 03:11:24,140
I actually have a subway sandwich in the fridge right now. I might grab it

2743
03:11:24,780 --> 03:11:28,300
But yes, please do remember to hydrate. Am I allowed to quickly go grab it?

2744
03:11:28,300 --> 03:11:30,300
Mmm

2745
03:11:31,100 --> 03:11:35,900
Rant and straw. No, please don't stop. Grape for me more. I mean rant to me some more

2746
03:11:36,620 --> 03:11:43,980
Riefling you're saying the quiet part. Rooster maxing a bit peckish. Honestly real. Oh, sorry. My cursor went on screen there

2747
03:11:43,980 --> 03:11:45,980
How unprofessional is this?

2748
03:11:49,980 --> 03:11:52,860
Do we have monkey nuts or do they expire?

2749
03:11:53,100 --> 03:12:00,380
Now just so he's no being a weirdo. I'm gonna buy a few more monkey nuts

2750
03:12:01,180 --> 03:12:05,020
I know it's expensive. I know we're getting charged out the wazoo

2751
03:12:05,100 --> 03:12:09,020
But I'd rather we unlock him because it's a level seven pinata

2752
03:12:09,100 --> 03:12:14,300
We don't actually have it or a tier seven or a rank seven. I don't know how you want to say it, but

2753
03:12:14,940 --> 03:12:17,340
But um, yes, he's coming

2754
03:12:18,380 --> 03:12:20,380
And if we unlock him we'll get quite a lot. Oh

2755
03:12:20,540 --> 03:12:27,900
Please go away. Please go away. I'm gonna pay you 20 bucks 300 to go away. Thank you. Please don't ruin my garden

2756
03:12:28,060 --> 03:12:32,540
We will get that cutlass very soon. I don't think we've unlocked it yet. I do a pot. Where did that monkey go?

2757
03:12:35,500 --> 03:12:38,860
You're attacking the tree when there's monkey nuts on the ground

2758
03:12:39,980 --> 03:12:41,980
Don't be so selfish

2759
03:12:42,620 --> 03:12:48,220
There's no bread in my garden. Sorry little guy. Okay you eat the corn and tell me what else you need

2760
03:12:50,380 --> 03:12:52,860
Wake up. It's the first of the month

2761
03:12:53,660 --> 03:12:57,180
A pumpkin seed. I can do that. That's not a problem at all

2762
03:12:58,940 --> 03:13:01,740
He's what monkey return to monkey

2763
03:13:03,100 --> 03:13:08,540
For the first time I have sent a spicy marrow. I didn't inspire you real true

2764
03:13:10,700 --> 03:13:13,020
Oh, what audio am I doing after stream? I don't know

2765
03:13:15,740 --> 03:13:19,260
Maybe I'm just going for it. Maybe I should just send it. I'll just send it

2766
03:13:21,340 --> 03:13:23,340
Wow

2767
03:13:23,660 --> 03:13:25,900
Unless you guys want me to say something. I don't know

2768
03:13:26,860 --> 03:13:28,860
Okay, then eat the pumpkin seed

2769
03:13:29,580 --> 03:13:37,740
We got the monkey return to monkey return to monkey and we leveled up and we leveled up

2770
03:13:41,180 --> 03:13:47,740
Level 24 I was gonna say 23 right you two kiss each other right now on the lips

2771
03:13:48,620 --> 03:13:53,900
That's right. You better kiss. Okay after we've hatched the egg. I'll go get some food. Okay

2772
03:13:55,820 --> 03:14:00,860
You do inspire. Is that what we're calling it now? Oh, you've inspired all over me strongy

2773
03:14:08,220 --> 03:14:12,540
Okay, so we've now just added an element where we can get blown up to

2774
03:14:13,980 --> 03:14:15,980
Are you squid in mirror? I'm going for it

2775
03:14:16,940 --> 03:14:24,060
I just wanted something your eyes hypnotize us, but I can imagine every part of you can make reeflings addicted

2776
03:14:24,460 --> 03:14:30,380
Your drool tasting sweet from a passionate kiss your cream from your plan being an addictive treat

2777
03:14:30,860 --> 03:14:32,860
That honestly sounds hot. Oh

2778
03:14:34,700 --> 03:14:37,340
Oh, this is for the audio. Okay. Okay. Okay

2779
03:14:40,860 --> 03:14:45,020
Wait, you want me to make it not just an audio you want me to like

2780
03:14:45,820 --> 03:14:47,820
Show my model at the same time

2781
03:14:48,540 --> 03:14:50,540
No, because the face is going to be like

2782
03:14:53,740 --> 03:14:59,900
I can't show the model at the same time because my face is going to freaking show it. That's too embarrassing

2783
03:15:01,900 --> 03:15:04,380
I can't do that. That's too embarrassing

2784
03:15:05,420 --> 03:15:10,060
Thank you anonymous for the tips. Oh my god. I don't think I can do that

2785
03:15:10,220 --> 03:15:11,340
Me right now

2786
03:15:11,340 --> 03:15:12,460
I'll do the

2787
03:15:12,460 --> 03:15:18,620
Strongly do you need help in the garden because I would love to plough your back field and fill it with seed. Yes

2788
03:15:19,580 --> 03:15:22,700
That's it. You did it. Wait, you called yourself field worker

2789
03:15:23,900 --> 03:15:25,900
Oh

2790
03:15:29,900 --> 03:15:32,460
Oh, they're doing a little dance together

2791
03:15:34,700 --> 03:15:39,900
Are they cutting all their country bumpkin chickens? Oh, this is so cute

2792
03:15:40,380 --> 03:15:44,220
Basically whiz. Thank you for becoming a member. Please enjoy the emotes

2793
03:15:45,100 --> 03:15:51,340
That you have access to now and thank you field worker for the tip of the hilarious thing. Okay. Okay. Okay, right

2794
03:15:51,340 --> 03:15:56,060

2795
03:15:57,420 --> 03:16:01,340
This chicken I need to select it and when the egg comes

2796
03:16:02,220 --> 03:16:04,380
Where is she there? She's coming. She's coming. Okay

2797
03:16:05,180 --> 03:16:07,580
The chickens can hatch eggs faster

2798
03:16:08,140 --> 03:16:14,460
That's their like secret ability a few pinatas have secret abilities like the taffy can make fertilizer from fruit

2799
03:16:15,260 --> 03:16:17,260
Um only not vegetables

2800
03:16:17,580 --> 03:16:20,380
But they can make a fertilizer. Okay, so move the egg

2801
03:16:20,940 --> 03:16:25,900
Select the chick. No. No, they're both trying to go in the house right now. Nope. Not happening

2802
03:16:27,260 --> 03:16:29,180
You need to

2803
03:16:29,180 --> 03:16:32,220
Let me select you and open up this egg right now

2804
03:16:32,540 --> 03:16:37,500
Set on the egg and open up and then give us that achievement. I know it's coming

2805
03:16:43,580 --> 03:16:45,580
We got 20 G's

2806
03:16:46,380 --> 03:16:50,860
We bro, we are swimming and gaming's gamer score

2807
03:16:51,500 --> 03:16:57,580
We are swimming in it. Really legend. Thank you for the faces would make me ink hard. No, my face would be like

2808
03:16:58,380 --> 03:17:00,460
Like no, that's silly. You didn't even see me

2809
03:17:00,460 --> 03:17:05,180
I'll be frog blinking so hard because my eyes are like rolling into the back of my skull

2810
03:17:05,660 --> 03:17:10,860
I'll be like frog blinking. I don't want to frog blink. That's some bad way. Oh, they have each other to cuddle

2811
03:17:14,140 --> 03:17:17,900
Uh, right. Okay. Oh, I just remembered

2812
03:17:19,260 --> 03:17:21,260

2813
03:17:21,260 --> 03:17:23,260
cluckles

2814
03:17:23,820 --> 03:17:25,820
Oh

2815
03:17:26,140 --> 03:17:28,640
Look at the bees. They're so organized

2816
03:17:32,380 --> 03:17:38,380
I'm like 99% sure you need to eat a cluckle if I'm not mistaken. Mr

2817
03:17:39,580 --> 03:17:41,580
Don't think I'm not on to you darling

2818
03:17:42,860 --> 03:17:47,980
I'm gonna leave the cluckles in the garden because my brain is telling me that they

2819
03:17:48,140 --> 03:17:53,100
Another day of zero action. Okay. Yeah cat snakes. Okay

2820
03:17:53,580 --> 03:17:57,500
One two three four five six seven

2821

Resident award. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go

And then master romancer so we can sell five one two three four five

2825
03:18:12,620 --> 03:18:14,620
And just like that

2826
03:18:15,740 --> 03:18:20,060
Hi strony. I just started subscribing to your alternative audio

2827
03:18:20,780 --> 03:18:24,220
I listened to the one you did with your team quick question

2828
03:18:24,700 --> 03:18:28,460
Does your mouth actually get wetter when you stick something inside it?

2829
03:18:28,780 --> 03:18:32,860
When I record I can use a prop or I can use my finger

2830
03:18:32,940 --> 03:18:35,420
But when stuff enters my mouth my saliva glands

2831
03:18:35,660 --> 03:18:42,220
Actually, some of you might have this or maybe it's just a me. No, it's not just a me thing because I looked it up and I'm fine. Um

2832
03:18:43,420 --> 03:18:44,300
I

2833
03:18:44,300 --> 03:18:47,180
Actually when if I don't eat for a really long time

2834
03:18:47,500 --> 03:18:53,500
Um, and then puts like food in my mouth my mouth squirts out like so much saliva

2835
03:18:53,980 --> 03:18:55,980
So quickly that it hurts

2836
03:18:57,660 --> 03:19:02,860
Like so, yeah, it's actually like a real thing with me. I'm actually gonna sell sin a monkey

2837
03:19:03,020 --> 03:19:05,740
I feel bad because he's just been chilling on his own, but

2838
03:19:06,540 --> 03:19:12,460
Uh, what do you need has eaten a ball eaten? You're gonna get a fur ball you you figure

2839
03:19:13,660 --> 03:19:15,660
I'm imagining things now

2840
03:19:17,580 --> 03:19:22,860
We got a cake loss home and it's less than a hundred points. That's not bad price. Well, I don't think it's a bad price

2841
03:19:25,900 --> 03:19:27,900
There we go

2842
03:19:27,980 --> 03:19:33,900
Uh, did that guy enter the lobby enter the lobby enter the card in

2843
03:19:34,540 --> 03:19:40,060
I thought that was normal. No, like it hurts so much. I guess we both have it towels towels everywhere when recording

2844
03:19:40,940 --> 03:19:45,500
You're laughing. I have two towels in my recording booth. I'm not even kidding

2845
03:19:45,500 --> 03:19:47,820
I have two towels to wipe everything

2846
03:19:48,620 --> 03:19:50,620
Like after I record

2847
03:19:51,020 --> 03:19:55,020
I was actually as a donut on reward. I was gonna take a picture of my recording booth

2848
03:19:55,660 --> 03:19:59,580
There's so many things in it that it would have to get posted on the alt

2849
03:19:59,660 --> 03:20:02,940
But the recording booth has like a lot in it

2850
03:20:04,380 --> 03:20:07,580
But I do genuinely have two towels for any stuff

2851
03:20:08,300 --> 03:20:11,500
That made did he really just go home the evil?

2852
03:20:12,060 --> 03:20:13,580
A pinata

2853
03:20:13,580 --> 03:20:16,460
Where did he go? You were here is that is he on the perimeter?

2854
03:20:17,180 --> 03:20:19,180
No, that's a fudge hog

2855
03:20:19,420 --> 03:20:22,780
There's two fudge hogs tonight. No, I don't need a fudge hog

2856
03:20:23,900 --> 03:20:24,940
Hmm

2857
03:20:24,940 --> 03:20:30,140
It's trying to how much for a bottle of saliva. Oh, you're gonna drink it. No, I don't

2858
03:20:30,780 --> 03:20:34,300
I mean, it's different if you open up your mouth and let me spit in it, but

2859
03:20:35,100 --> 03:20:39,180
Drinking and my spare you want to drink my spittle

2860
03:20:39,900 --> 03:20:47,740
Okay, this is a flower so we can overwater it and then we can put loads of fertilizer. Maybe a little

2861
03:20:48,860 --> 03:20:50,860
replaying

2862
03:20:51,420 --> 03:20:53,660
I must not encourage you to do a bad thing

2863
03:20:54,460 --> 03:20:57,180
But well, if you're at work anyway, why not?

2864
03:20:57,740 --> 03:21:01,500
Um, thank you so much anonymous for enjoying the alternate of ideals

2865
03:21:02,540 --> 03:21:03,820
um

2866
03:21:03,820 --> 03:21:05,820
Hope last night's one went well

2867
03:21:06,860 --> 03:21:08,380
um

2868
03:21:08,460 --> 03:21:12,460
It was a a unique plot. I do like my unique plot. Um

2869
03:21:14,060 --> 03:21:21,340
I definitely say probably in the later months. I might kind of calm down on doing like a really specific topic

2870
03:21:23,500 --> 03:21:27,820
But I like that because then I was like, oh my record is one minute 58

2871
03:21:28,140 --> 03:21:32,300
I can't I'll need to find the freaking video and share it and then you guys would be like

2872
03:21:32,380 --> 03:21:35,260
Wow, you really do like the back door and I'll be like, yes

2873
03:21:39,340 --> 03:21:44,940
Um, you've been encouraging us for like an hour. Stop you. I'm such a bad

2874
03:21:47,740 --> 03:21:50,540
I end up spitting while talking to my friends. It's so annoying

2875
03:21:51,820 --> 03:21:53,820
my pool

2876
03:21:55,500 --> 03:21:57,500
Pool I know I love it

2877
03:21:58,140 --> 03:22:01,900
No, when I get excited, I'm not allowed to talk because I start spitting everywhere

2878
03:22:02,300 --> 03:22:07,580
But that's the best thing about being a youtuber is that you can't watch the spit flying at my mouth when I get excited

2879
03:22:09,180 --> 03:22:10,700
Ah

2880
03:22:10,700 --> 03:22:13,200
So I don't have to be embarrassed when I get hyper

2881
03:22:15,340 --> 03:22:17,340
It's so easy

2882
03:22:19,020 --> 03:22:25,900
Oh my god, did you fucking see that shondal got bloody banned seven day suspension on twitch

2893
03:23:14,940 --> 03:23:19,420
Oh, no, there's a pretzel, but I don't want them to come in the garden

2894
03:23:21,020 --> 03:23:23,900
It's eating a mouse malo right. I'll go get you a wee mouse malo

2895
03:23:25,660 --> 03:23:29,500
She just got back from a mental health break too. So I don't want to do her any good

2896
03:23:30,060 --> 03:23:36,700
Hopefully she just sees it as frustrating and not like a negative thing like against her. Does that make sense?

2897
03:23:37,180 --> 03:23:41,660
It's not a negative thing against her. It's the freaking thing just being silly

2898
03:23:42,940 --> 03:23:44,940
Jeff Bezos let her earn money

2899
03:23:46,140 --> 03:23:48,140
Just Jeff Bezos on twin

2900
03:23:50,780 --> 03:23:56,300

03:24:07,980 --> 03:24:11,980
What was the game 2006? Did I even have vocabulary? No

2904
03:24:14,540 --> 03:24:16,540

2913
03:25:03,980 --> 03:25:05,980

2917
03:25:18,300 --> 03:25:22,940

2918
03:25:24,620 --> 03:25:26,620
Surely it's like a

2919
03:25:26,940 --> 03:25:33,020
Oh, just promote it how you want because like if I made an audio where I was having fireworks

2920
03:25:34,780 --> 03:25:37,340
And and saying use code strongy at gamers

2921
03:25:39,100 --> 03:25:44,540
Could I in trouble for that or would they be like genius marketing sales are up keep keep at it you slag

2922
03:25:45,500 --> 03:25:53,740
They pat me on the back. They're like I keep up your slag. That's great. Keep going sales are up. I mean in theory

2923
03:25:57,180 --> 03:26:02,700

2924
03:26:02,700 --> 03:26:04,700
As always all the merch goes to them

Fine

2936
03:27:05,660 --> 03:27:09,420
But I could cough on you and you'd fall over. Why are you so nasty?

2937
03:27:10,380 --> 03:27:15,100
Wait, hold on. I need to change the name. Give me a second. Give me a second. This is wifling

Oh, no, it doesn't register the the the symbol right? Okay, hold on

2944
03:27:39,100 --> 03:27:42,300
Let me get rid of the number then because it just looks like I've called you wifling number three

2945
03:27:43,580 --> 03:27:47,580
That doesn't make any sense. Oh, oh wait, hold on dragonfly time

2946
03:27:47,900 --> 03:27:48,940
Oh

2948
03:27:53,180 --> 03:27:59,340

2949
03:28:00,540 --> 03:28:02,380
Brustle

2950
03:28:02,380 --> 03:28:07,340
Trying to strike a chord and it's probably a minor. Hey, that's probably a minor

2951
03:28:07,900 --> 03:28:12,540
Honestly wiflings. It's time to go to a party. Are you ready wifling?

2952
03:28:14,540 --> 03:28:16,540
Off to a party you go

2954
03:28:26,860 --> 03:28:30,140
What happened to the first two I R worded them too hard

2955
03:28:31,660 --> 03:28:36,460
They look like the meme for that ladies at the side of the bed and there's like wrappers on the bed

2956
03:28:36,700 --> 03:28:39,900
That's what happened to the first two during their life force

2957
03:28:40,860 --> 03:28:43,580
Oh, it's my little wifling. Oh wifling

2958

Look how happy you are to be next to me. Will we pimp you out? Let's see if we can find any outfits that might

2962
03:29:04,300 --> 03:29:06,300

Which might make you more confident. You're such a confident boy. Would you have a little daisy in your

Oh my god, we have the dlc

2968
03:29:37,340 --> 03:29:39,580
I didn't even know they had microtransactions in the game

2969
03:29:40,460 --> 03:29:46,380
Okay, I don't think there's a hat that complements. Yeah. Whoa, you can just be a warrior. I'm like warrior

2970
03:29:47,500 --> 03:29:49,500
Okay, we're not gonna make you the police

We if anything, you're the one who needs the police. No, you're not having giggly eyes

2972
03:29:54,700 --> 03:30:01,740
Uh, my glasses aren't here. Could maybe put your butt caterpillar eyebrow. No wifling. That's not what you look like

You have a mustache. Why why yes, I'm just an innocent wifling

I don't do anything naughty. Maybe the mustache

2979
03:30:24,780 --> 03:30:28,220
Maybe the mustache not that I see you with the mustache, but I feel like

03:30:28,860 --> 03:30:34,380
I feel like you would come back into the asmr booth and be like, oh, I'm a completely new wifling

Please don't kick me out. Oh, do you want a bow in your butt?

Oh red. It's either the red one or the bell

2995
03:31:30,780 --> 03:31:36,140
I'm tempted for the bell. So I know when you're awake to come and milk you

2996

I'm tempted. I think the bell suits your purple better. Okay. I'm gonna put the bell

She knows when you've been good or bad. So be good for goodness sake. Okay. You definitely do not have a girl

Because it's like the roof of its mouth has literally been destroyed smile

3052
03:35:59,740 --> 03:36:01,740

3053
03:36:02,780 --> 03:36:04,780

03:36:27,340 --> 03:36:29,340
Oh a badge sickle

Oh, hello little guy. Unfortunately. I don't have what he wants

3060
03:36:33,980 --> 03:36:40,780
I'm opening up my my sandwich. I can't remember what one this is. I have two signatures

3061
03:36:45,660 --> 03:36:47,660
Oh, okay, go go go

03:37:20,300 --> 03:37:24,140
Any stinker didn't oh I had two moth ropes without realizing

3069
03:37:24,940 --> 03:37:31,100
Unfortunately, our money has gone down considerably because we're doing the patchouliah

3070
03:37:32,300 --> 03:37:36,700
Thing it does cost quite a bit. What does your home look like?

3071

Oh my god, you have blankies outside of your home. Oh weflin you got cookies you want me to make your cookies

Oh my god, you eat you eat animal food just like me remember that time

3074
03:37:57,500 --> 03:38:01,340
I confessed that I used to eat cat food as a child because I thought it would turn me into a cat

3075
03:38:01,820 --> 03:38:03,820
Refling you did the same thing

3076
03:38:05,580 --> 03:38:07,580
I didn't know that

3077
03:38:07,820 --> 03:38:12,300
What's inside your house? Oh should I send you into your house or are you not? Oh refling

3078
03:38:13,100 --> 03:38:19,260
Hey wakey wakey refling you need to go in your home so I can spy on you inside your home for no particular reason

3079
03:38:19,580 --> 03:38:21,580
Oh, baby

3080
03:38:21,980 --> 03:38:24,940
And you go, huh? Are you climbing into your home?

3081
03:38:26,300 --> 03:38:31,740
Oh you in your home now you're gonna have a nice sleep in your home. Yeah, let's look inside. Okay

3082
03:38:32,700 --> 03:38:34,700
What you doing?

3083
03:38:35,580 --> 03:38:41,180
Oh, you're not asleep yet. You silly belly. You need to go sleep and don't get your tail on fire either

3084
03:38:41,260 --> 03:38:44,300
Okay, I'm gonna be scared for you. It looks like it's fine

3085
03:38:44,380 --> 03:38:51,260
Cat food story I confess that as a child I ate wet cat food

3086
03:38:52,140 --> 03:38:58,380
Um because I thought it was gonna turn me into a cat. Don't ask me why I just thought it was so I used to like eat

3087
03:39:01,020 --> 03:39:04,620
But it wasn't like I've replaced meals with it or anything. It wasn't like that

3088
03:39:04,860 --> 03:39:11,100
It was just like a few bites here and there until eventually, you know, I stopped the behavior

3089
03:39:12,060 --> 03:39:15,420
Hey wakey wakey cats. I know you're tired, but up you come

3090
03:39:16,060 --> 03:39:18,460
Someone needs to eat a mouse. Is it you?

3091
03:39:19,420 --> 03:39:21,420
It's you that was incredibly lucky

3092
03:39:22,620 --> 03:39:24,620
Please be up this mouse right now

3093
03:39:27,580 --> 03:39:29,820
That's the only thing about the

3094
03:39:32,860 --> 03:39:34,860
Wait, why is this taking so long to grow?

3095
03:39:35,820 --> 03:39:42,700
You're a rubbish hunter. Try again. Go again. No. Oh, she's going up the tree

3096
03:39:44,940 --> 03:39:48,860
Okay, I just kind of parkoured up the tree a little bit but it's gone away again

3097
03:39:49,900 --> 03:39:51,660
She's so testing

3098
03:39:51,660 --> 03:39:56,380
But what if you're one bite away from becoming a cat? Stop because my dumb ass will be like, oh my god, real

3099
03:39:56,780 --> 03:40:02,300
Oh reef and I need to send you out on another journey again. Okay. I need that little sweetie

3100
03:40:02,540 --> 03:40:09,260
Try again. Okay. I believe in you. Oh, no, don't get sad because the piña is about to be eaten. I need it for romance

3101
03:40:12,220 --> 03:40:16,460
Right, I'm gonna take a bite of my food. Okay. I'll be a saja. I'm gonna do a big bite

3102
03:40:21,980 --> 03:40:29,020
That 99% of autistic girls stop eating cat food before they become a cat. That's terrible

3103
03:40:29,020 --> 03:40:31,020
Oh

3104
03:40:31,900 --> 03:40:33,900
Is it thank you Mars?

3105
03:40:34,780 --> 03:40:38,060
Did you manage to find that reef one? You're dead

3106
03:40:39,980 --> 03:40:41,980
Oh

3107
03:40:41,980 --> 03:40:43,980
Oh, I'm choking but

3108
03:40:44,780 --> 03:40:50,940
Right, okay. I'm fine. Um, you're dead. You got this sweet dropped it and then went for the candy. You're so fucking cute

3109
03:40:51,260 --> 03:40:55,020
You're like hell, yeah, I deserve the sweet treat. Of course you deserve the sweet treat

3110
03:40:56,060 --> 03:40:58,060
My little baby back. Okay

3111
03:40:59,980 --> 03:41:01,980
I'ma I'ma keep eating

3112
03:41:05,900 --> 03:41:10,380
You're total to be eating the cat food. I think I was like four years old or something

3113
03:41:12,060 --> 03:41:14,060
I was quite young

3114
03:41:15,660 --> 03:41:17,660
How about a cat food eating stream?

3115
03:41:18,300 --> 03:41:20,860
It's not fit for human consumption apparently

3116
03:41:21,740 --> 03:41:25,500
I mean, maybe I don't a thumb reward would be that. How was the cat food?

3117
03:41:26,460 --> 03:41:28,940
Controversial take it wasn't that bad

3118
03:41:30,860 --> 03:41:35,100
I don't know what cat nibbles are like though. I never ate nibbles. I ate the weight food

3119
03:41:44,300 --> 03:41:45,580
Hmm

3120
03:41:45,580 --> 03:41:49,900
Usually I'm off the opposite opinion, but scrawny absolutely can talk with her mouth

3121
03:41:50,780 --> 03:41:56,140
Oh, yeah, you should see me when I've got your tentacle on mama. It's still easy

3122
03:41:58,380 --> 03:42:00,380
The texture of the wet stuff terrifies

3123
03:42:05,820 --> 03:42:12,060
Is it like sure not no I had a I think it was like either chicken or beef cube type thing

3124
03:42:12,780 --> 03:42:14,780
Hmm

3125
03:42:19,020 --> 03:42:22,220
It's meat waste so it tastes like meat. Yeah, basically wait what grew

3126
03:42:23,020 --> 03:42:29,660
Something grew. Okay. Watch half live. We've got a oh we grew this snap dragon flower. That's lovely

3127
03:42:42,380 --> 03:42:43,660
I

3128
03:42:43,660 --> 03:42:49,100
Forgot how hungry I was until I started eating whips. I always do that like I'm like, oh, yeah

3129
03:42:49,100 --> 03:42:55,500
Wait a minute. I need help. Oh the cats gonna do something together. Hold on. I'm playing one handed. So sorry if it's a bit funny

3130
03:42:57,740 --> 03:42:59,980
Okay, they're gonna do their thing

3131
03:43:00,300 --> 03:43:02,300
Oh

3132
03:43:06,460 --> 03:43:08,460
How's Gimli and Beagle?

3133
03:43:11,980 --> 03:43:13,980
Gimli

3134
03:43:16,780 --> 03:43:19,820
What am I to do? Oh my god, can I do this one handed or Danny to

3135
03:43:21,820 --> 03:43:25,340
Oh shit. Oh my god. I'm so skinny. I'm so skinny

3136
03:43:25,900 --> 03:43:32,940
Oh, I did it. Um, Gimli's actually really distraught. My dad is gone. She was behaving so funny

3137
03:43:33,100 --> 03:43:35,900
But she's had up. She's like doing her big sleep right now

3138
03:43:36,540 --> 03:43:38,060
and Beagle

3139
03:43:38,060 --> 03:43:40,060

3140
03:43:40,460 --> 03:43:45,020
And but they were really they're really unhappy that my dad is going and I'm like, oh, sorry

3141
03:43:47,100 --> 03:43:48,860
Him

3142
03:43:48,860 --> 03:43:54,220
Mommy you need to listen to your tummy before the clam. I just don't realize I'm like, oh I'm having so much fun

3143
03:43:54,300 --> 03:43:59,580
I'm like, oh wait a minute. I need to like hydrate and eat. I'm like, oh, I'm always dehydrated also

3144
03:43:59,580 --> 03:44:01,900
Me has like one bottle of water for an eight hour stream

3145
03:44:03,420 --> 03:44:05,420
I've had one sip out of my water

3146
03:44:16,380 --> 03:44:21,500
Wait a minute. I need to survive honestly real real true in me

3147
03:44:21,980 --> 03:44:27,100
Okay, I got a word. Oh level 27

3148
03:44:35,180 --> 03:44:37,580
We're starting to drink and eat get those nutrients

3149
03:44:43,180 --> 03:44:49,340
I can imagine Strani coming back from her workout and the refling wanting to get a taste of her clam after it

3150
03:44:49,340 --> 03:44:52,380
Has marinated inside a yoga pants and her sweat

3151
03:45:06,380 --> 03:45:09,340
Thank you for the tip Arnaud. No

3152
03:45:13,980 --> 03:45:15,980
Imagine the smell literally

3153
03:45:20,220 --> 03:45:22,220
Hmm

3154
03:45:23,980 --> 03:45:25,980
I knew I had an extra mouse

3155
03:45:30,300 --> 03:45:33,980
My game is being salty clam literally though

3156
03:45:36,780 --> 03:45:41,740
Oh, I finally grew a pinot is about to be eaten who?

3157
03:45:41,740 --> 03:45:43,740
Who

3158
03:45:47,100 --> 03:45:49,420
Who is he in oh a task life

3159
03:45:53,260 --> 03:45:55,260
Why is it so

3160
03:45:55,580 --> 03:46:07,740
I've seen some good quality tools in my time, but yours is really impressive

3161
03:46:11,580 --> 03:46:18,140
I don't think your shovel could get much stronger. It's tough enough to break almost anything. Okay. Okay

3162
03:46:19,580 --> 03:46:21,580
Um, right

3163
03:46:22,380 --> 03:46:26,380
Uh, okay. Yes, it was a task life. Oh, no, I don't have the thing for him

3164
03:46:34,620 --> 03:46:36,620
He wants a swan

3165
03:46:39,260 --> 03:46:41,100
Sorry, I keep talking with my phone

3166
03:46:41,100 --> 03:46:45,580
He wants a swan, but I don't have it. So I'm actually gonna be a naughty boy

3167
03:46:46,460 --> 03:46:49,180
I'm going to the shop and buy the tower of sorrow piece for him

3168
03:46:49,420 --> 03:46:54,140
The opening hours of pay off and we got a new seed. What did we get? We just got a banana seed. So what's this seed?

3169
03:46:55,180 --> 03:46:57,180
A bull rush

3170
03:46:57,260 --> 03:46:59,260
Is that what this actual name is called?

3171
03:47:01,500 --> 03:47:05,660
I'm gonna shove a few around here. I'm gonna pimp the swamp out a little bit

3172
03:47:12,460 --> 03:47:16,220
Marinate is such a strong word strong air fresheners

3173
03:47:17,180 --> 03:47:19,740
I don't think I'd be freshening up anything

3174
03:47:20,620 --> 03:47:24,380
I'll be adding to the stank of the the the room you're in

3175
03:47:25,660 --> 03:47:28,140
Or your car wait sold out how?

3176
03:47:32,220 --> 03:47:34,220
Because he's not entered my garden yet

3177
03:47:46,220 --> 03:47:53,740
I'm just drawing a gap in about the game while the reeflands are hypnotized by the accent real truth

3178
03:47:55,420 --> 03:48:01,660
No lies detected. I'm gonna level up all these little brushless things. Oh, I should do the banana tree actually

3179
03:48:04,300 --> 03:48:06,940
Well, it's not ready for it. The trees are a bit different

3180
03:48:07,020 --> 03:48:10,140
They have to you have to like do it at a certain time for a tree or the trees like

3181
03:48:11,020 --> 03:48:13,580
No, I'm like, oh I was a bit too early there

3182
03:48:14,540 --> 03:48:20,140
That's good enough as long as it covers my own stink. Oh, not all of us for one max and hold on a minute

3183
03:48:21,980 --> 03:48:23,980
Okay

3184
03:48:24,140 --> 03:48:25,900
I'd finish

3185
03:48:25,900 --> 03:48:28,140
My half sandwich. I'm sorry for the rustling

3186
03:48:31,660 --> 03:48:35,100
You said bye for freeze cuttlefish crawls. That's so good

3187
03:48:37,020 --> 03:48:39,020
Hmm

3188
03:48:39,420 --> 03:48:43,420
I have seen this candle company because they partnered with hi, baby

3189
03:48:45,020 --> 03:48:47,020
They partnered with

3190
03:48:48,540 --> 03:48:50,140
Fua

3191
03:48:50,140 --> 03:48:51,340
the Neko

3192
03:48:51,340 --> 03:48:55,180
And I've seen it like about and I'm like, oh, I'm sure it's like

3193
03:48:55,820 --> 03:48:59,500
All legit and that it's just like such a funny concept because mine would be like what lemon

3194
03:49:01,420 --> 03:49:07,900
Uh, right. She is going home. So unfortunately this banana tree is gonna perish without me

3195
03:49:08,460 --> 03:49:10,060
stepping in

3196
03:49:10,060 --> 03:49:12,060
So I'm just gonna over water it on purpose

3197
03:49:13,500 --> 03:49:16,140
It would be called cuttlefish clam slam real true

3198
03:49:17,100 --> 03:49:19,100
I could not wait to play Elden Ring again

3199
03:49:21,020 --> 03:49:26,540
Um, I'm actually needing to play a game with sin. We need to pick a game, but not pick one

3200
03:49:28,220 --> 03:49:32,940
I may tell her to pick are we smart if the millionaire stream goes well

3201
03:49:33,180 --> 03:49:38,380
I'm gonna tell her to play our a us like we'll play. Are you smarter than a fifth grader?

3202
03:49:39,020 --> 03:49:41,420
Or whatever the other equivalent was

3203
03:49:42,140 --> 03:49:44,140
um

3204
03:49:44,220 --> 03:49:45,660
And

3205
03:49:45,660 --> 03:49:49,180
Then we'll shock each other if we get it wrong. I think that would be an easier

3206
03:49:49,340 --> 03:49:52,860
All of you fighting over the clam and I'm just back here enjoying the

3207
03:49:53,580 --> 03:49:54,940
real

3208
03:49:54,940 --> 03:49:56,620
Thank you

3209
03:49:56,620 --> 03:49:59,100
Actually real. Thank you sleepy fan ink

3210
03:49:59,100 --> 03:50:06,380
The clam slam is a blessing before you go into war. Oh, no, everything's popping

3211
03:50:06,860 --> 03:50:11,740
The only annoying thing about stuff popping is because you have to like

3212
03:50:12,700 --> 03:50:14,460
um

3213
03:50:14,460 --> 03:50:18,860
Refertilize it if you want it to be like a big one. Does that make sense?

3214
03:50:19,980 --> 03:50:24,380
Is that english? Should I just speak english there? Actually, I'm gonna replant a third one

3215
03:50:25,100 --> 03:50:27,100
Um

3216
03:50:28,220 --> 03:50:30,220
Thank you for the super chat

3217
03:50:30,380 --> 03:50:32,940
Are you smarter than a wiefling? Is it cool up?

3218
03:50:33,020 --> 03:50:36,860
Can I play with you guys and we like answer the same question? I will go feral

3219
03:50:37,900 --> 03:50:40,220
I will go feral if that's true in real

3220
03:50:40,860 --> 03:50:42,860
So I'm itching my face out of itchy face

3221
03:50:43,980 --> 03:50:45,980
um

3222
03:50:45,980 --> 03:50:47,980
If if if

3223
03:50:50,780 --> 03:50:52,780
Um

3224
03:50:53,180 --> 03:50:55,180
Azura normally starts at 10 a.m

3225
03:50:55,180 --> 03:50:56,300
At time

3226
03:50:56,300 --> 03:51:01,500
So it's a two hour warning. Amy if she's streaming today should be starting

3227
03:51:03,980 --> 03:51:07,100
When I don't know in five minutes

3228
03:51:08,140 --> 03:51:10,140
When will we find out the chest stream?

3229
03:51:11,100 --> 03:51:15,660
Uh, it must be next week. So I'm gonna there's a multiplayer game next week

3230
03:51:15,660 --> 03:51:18,460
I picked fortnite, but if you guys hate it, I can swap it

3231
03:51:19,020 --> 03:51:21,260
I didn't know what to do. Amy isn't on today. Okay

3232
03:51:22,140 --> 03:51:28,220
Strawny being a feeder and about stuff. She wants to shove things and the reason's not that we shoved something in another end realtor

3233
03:51:29,340 --> 03:51:31,340
Amy's off today. Okay. Okay. Okay. Um

3234
03:51:31,900 --> 03:51:36,060
Well can redirect into mercy anyway because it's a endurance stream or well

3235
03:51:36,780 --> 03:51:39,100
I mean, it's been a while since I've done actual endurance stream

3236
03:51:39,100 --> 03:51:45,340
But like this is just uh, let me ease into it. Let me see how it goes ever played stardew valley. I have it

3237
03:51:45,580 --> 03:51:48,860
No, I have and I tried to get into it

3238
03:51:49,740 --> 03:51:51,580
but

3239
03:51:51,580 --> 03:51:53,100
It was

3240
03:51:53,100 --> 03:51:55,900
I don't I think I was playing it wrong or something. I don't know

3241
03:51:56,140 --> 03:52:00,300
I think it's one of those games where I couldn't stream it because I would be too quiet

3242
03:52:01,580 --> 03:52:03,180
um

3243
03:52:03,180 --> 03:52:05,180
Like it's one of those kind of games

3244
03:52:06,060 --> 03:52:08,060
As I'm fucking dying right now

3245
03:52:08,140 --> 03:52:09,260
um

3246
03:52:09,260 --> 03:52:10,860
I'll warm up endurance stream

3247
03:52:10,860 --> 03:52:15,340
Yeah, like it warming me up to our 12 hour marathons again because I need to get back to you

3248
03:52:15,660 --> 03:52:18,300
Uh, I will say one thing about the shorter streams

3249
03:52:18,300 --> 03:52:22,300
Like I could go to the shops with my dad and all that like I didn't feel too tired

3250
03:52:22,700 --> 03:52:27,420
And like we made some like really yummy food together like we had a chicken pie and veggies

3251
03:52:28,380 --> 03:52:32,060
Like the second last night. I think he was here. Um

3252
03:52:33,500 --> 03:52:35,500
And it was just like really nice

3253
03:52:35,660 --> 03:52:38,620
um, and like he made me steak and that and

3254
03:52:39,260 --> 03:52:42,860
Obviously when I stream long, I'm like, oh, but I don't have time for anything

3255
03:52:42,860 --> 03:52:47,100
Like I don't have the energy to go out say because I'm like trying to you know help the girls who do this or

3256
03:52:47,740 --> 03:52:49,740
the stuff behind the scenes and

3257
03:52:51,500 --> 03:52:55,020
Type thing and I don't have like enough time to like do that all for myself

3258
03:52:55,020 --> 03:52:57,500
So I just end up ordering like takeout and that which isn't

3259
03:52:58,220 --> 03:53:00,220
It's not very good for me, but

3260
03:53:00,220 --> 03:53:03,900
A chicken pot pie. I think that's what you guys call it

3261
03:53:03,900 --> 03:53:05,900
It's just like chicken in a pie

3262
03:53:08,060 --> 03:53:10,700
Is that what you call it pot because it's like a pot

3263
03:53:13,420 --> 03:53:18,460
I don't know if you're gonna play no build just play it FPS

3264
03:53:20,460 --> 03:53:25,180
I was gonna do no build fortnight. I think I can get you into my lobby if I'm not mistaken

3265
03:53:26,300 --> 03:53:28,300
Or did I make that up?

3266
03:53:29,260 --> 03:53:35,660
Right, we'll sell the kitty cat. What was that? I saw that. Um, I'm gonna sell the kitty cat

3267
03:53:36,300 --> 03:53:38,300
um

3268
03:53:38,940 --> 03:53:45,340
And then we'll do the next animal in her shop. It got peas and carrots too. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I had that good stuff in it

3269
03:53:45,420 --> 03:53:48,220
Yes, I had like vegetables inside it too. It was very nice

3270
03:53:49,420 --> 03:53:51,100
um

3271
03:53:51,100 --> 03:53:53,820
I think you have to add people on friends the epic game

3272
03:53:53,900 --> 03:54:00,300
Uh, I know people love to shit on apex, but apex have lobbies like no way that turns rot in the moment

3273
03:54:00,300 --> 03:54:02,300
I hover over it. Don't be so red

3274
03:54:03,900 --> 03:54:05,900
Don't be so red

3275
03:54:07,580 --> 03:54:10,620
Okay, let me get rid of these monkey nuts because I don't want them to go away

3276
03:54:12,060 --> 03:54:14,700
Actually, I might sell the trees the trees have

3277
03:54:15,980 --> 03:54:21,020
Have done their purpose which was to get me a monkey and I got it so

3278
03:54:21,660 --> 03:54:25,340
I hate when they get sad when I sell a tree like brov

3279
03:54:25,980 --> 03:54:31,020
You are not that like you are not that in love with the tree. I assure you right. I think we need

3280
03:54:31,900 --> 03:54:34,220
One more tree. It doesn't really matter what it is

3281
03:54:35,020 --> 03:54:39,740
Maybe I need two banana trees. I might need two banana trees. Can I interest you in something seedy?

3282
03:54:40,380 --> 03:54:44,220
Have you tried that healthy food quick service that ships to you?

3283
03:54:45,100 --> 03:54:47,020
um

3284
03:54:47,020 --> 03:54:49,020
I think they're um

3285
03:54:49,100 --> 03:54:55,180
Isn't that much cheaper, but I think there's something about them being like a really big don't

3286
03:54:56,220 --> 03:54:58,220
I don't have 16

3287
03:54:58,460 --> 03:55:00,940
16 water 16 percent water

3288
03:55:02,060 --> 03:55:04,060
I'm gonna have to extend the pool

3289
03:55:05,900 --> 03:55:07,900
I thought I had 16 percent water

3290
03:55:08,140 --> 03:55:09,340
um

3291
03:55:09,340 --> 03:55:14,780
Oh, I know how to create a reefing and spore stop. I will place spore. I'm not even kidding you

3292
03:55:14,780 --> 03:55:20,220
I will add it to the roster if you know how to tell me how to make a freaking reefing. I'll go absolutely mental

3293
03:55:21,820 --> 03:55:23,820
I'll go feral

3294
03:55:23,900 --> 03:55:27,420
A really big what I don't know. I've already forgotten what I was talking about. I'm sorry

3295
03:55:29,660 --> 03:55:35,100
Why why are you who are you to tell me why are you squidding me right now again? Yeah

3296
03:55:35,980 --> 03:55:41,660
Strongly after a hour of very sweaty exercise in a warm room. Oh your cake would taste divine

3297
03:55:41,900 --> 03:55:43,900
I

3298
03:55:44,380 --> 03:55:49,020
Think of I think I've got you under a little too good because oh my lord

3299
03:55:50,700 --> 03:55:52,860
If you think sweaty cake tastes good

3300
03:55:54,140 --> 03:55:56,140
I've hypnotized you too hard

3301
03:55:56,940 --> 03:56:01,260
I've broken you a little bit with that one have to I cooked a little too hard with that one chief

3302
03:56:03,660 --> 03:56:11,100
Okay, we're gonna just try and expand the water to see what this crocodile. Oh, he's who are you fighting with you wet far?

3303
03:56:11,740 --> 03:56:12,940
Oh

3304
03:56:12,940 --> 03:56:14,940
Oh, that's right. He sends workers home

3305
03:56:15,660 --> 03:56:21,500
As if a rough a ruffian is no no as if you are showing there's two of you

3306
03:56:23,740 --> 03:56:25,740
Just as

3307
03:56:26,300 --> 03:56:28,300
Just

3308
03:56:29,580 --> 03:56:31,580
Wait, I thought there was like a cutlass thing

3309
03:56:32,300 --> 03:56:38,380
As if two ruffians show up in my garden whilst I'm having a fight with a freaking sourpina 300 quid

3310
03:56:38,620 --> 03:56:45,820
Fuck off you 300 quid fuck off. He's literally gonna spit dirt in my puddle. I'm not even kidding. Oh, no. He is going away

3311
03:56:47,340 --> 03:56:50,220
Yeah, there. This is what they do. They like randomly freaking

3312
03:56:50,860 --> 03:56:54,860
Bro, what have I got? Sorry. There's a there's a pinata here

3314
03:57:00,940 --> 03:57:02,940
14 percent gosh, you're so

3315
03:57:03,660 --> 03:57:07,500
I've got a jameleon out of nowhere. It's all breaking out now. It's all happening now

3316
03:57:08,380 --> 03:57:14,380
This is what what you thought the exciting streams were when people are on fps shooters and going crazy and getting all these crazy kills

3317
03:57:14,380 --> 03:57:19,980
No, it's viva pinata, baby. When you get notification after notification, how can you possibly keep up?

3318
03:57:19,980 --> 03:57:24,300
You're trying to get a new resident pinata. You're trying to deal with the fight. You're trying to turn

3319
03:57:24,700 --> 03:57:29,180
Uh, a sour pinata into a good pinata. I mean come on. What more do you want?

3320
03:57:29,900 --> 03:57:33,420
The excitement the rush the thrill of viva pinata

3321
03:57:34,060 --> 03:57:40,380
Good afternoon, my friend today's just race by hasn't I love it. I love it. Thank you for entertaining me

Right, you're currently eating. What is the last item he needs? I have no idea. I cannot tell you

3329
03:58:15,180 --> 03:58:17,180
You want a shelly bean again

3330
03:58:18,780 --> 03:58:21,660
What's so popular about shelly beans at parties?

3331
03:58:23,020 --> 03:58:26,940
Don't have any idea what's going on. Oh, no, you never had a chance to play it

3332
03:58:27,580 --> 03:58:29,580
You know have

3333
03:58:30,540 --> 03:58:34,780
It's just chaos and level I'm just trying to level up the petals because then I can get more

3334
03:58:35,660 --> 03:58:37,660
pinatas unlocked

3335
03:58:37,660 --> 03:58:39,020

3336
03:58:39,020 --> 03:58:45,100
And all that jazz eat third. I don't know what the third thing he needs is and I'm getting nervous. I don't have it on standby

Transformation and tell me what berry is because I don't want to poison him

3342
03:59:04,620 --> 03:59:09,740
If I don't girl you need to water this tree as you walk away from the withering tree

3343
03:59:10,380 --> 03:59:12,380
Yeah, you're you're in trouble. You're done for

3344
03:59:14,060 --> 03:59:19,180
I know there's so much stuff that needs watered right now, but oof you're challenging me

3345
03:59:20,300 --> 03:59:22,620
Farmville but with an animal crossing twist

3346
03:59:23,420 --> 03:59:28,940
This came out way before viva pinatas more hardcore than doom eternal. Exactly. Thank you

3347
03:59:30,540 --> 03:59:36,700
I'm gonna pop that there. I've actually just seen we have a girl you walk

3348
03:59:39,260 --> 03:59:44,460
You are walking past all these things that need it. Okay, you are getting sold because you're a wee bit of money

3349
03:59:44,780 --> 03:59:48,300
Which I need because we're about to do the next thing. We need a jelly bean

3350
03:59:48,860 --> 03:59:54,860
Did I order? I did order a jelly bean. I can never remember feeding a nightshade berry and then hitting it got it

3351
03:59:55,180 --> 04:00:02,780
Right, what do you want has eaten three water lilies? Okay, you'll never guess what I have in the garden

04:00:07,100 --> 04:00:09,100
Please don't walk out of the garden

3353
04:00:09,580 --> 04:00:13,340
Please attack the plants and eat the water lilies because I know you can do it. Um

3354
04:00:14,140 --> 04:00:17,740
A nightshade. Okay. Oh got an award for growing a banana tree

3355
04:00:19,340 --> 04:00:22,220
Okay, okay nightshade berry nightshade berry nightshade

3356
04:00:22,220 --> 04:00:33,820
I doubted myself. I shouldn't have I can't believe it. I doubted myself

3357
04:00:34,700 --> 04:00:40,060
But deep down. I know I'm an absolute dweeb when it comes to my childhood game

3358
04:00:40,940 --> 04:00:43,100
I'm sorry. I ever did that to myself

3359
04:00:43,980 --> 04:00:45,980
Okay, and then basically

3360
04:00:46,780 --> 04:00:48,780
And then walk them

3361
04:00:49,100 --> 04:00:52,380
It's a very strange transformation

3362
04:00:52,940 --> 04:00:56,940
Oh, whoa, he's like is he the hypnosis one?

3363
04:00:57,980 --> 04:00:59,980
He's a lack of tongue

3364
04:01:01,340 --> 04:01:04,940
And we're level 30 in the garden for

3365
04:01:08,300 --> 04:01:10,940
You want to eat how much?

3366
04:01:14,060 --> 04:01:16,060
Four that's

3367
04:01:16,060 --> 04:01:18,060
Insanity

3368
04:01:18,300 --> 04:01:23,980
I can't believe xbox is too scared to make a leap up now funny. You mentioned that I saw whispers of it when there

3369
04:01:23,980 --> 04:01:30,220
Is that convention that went by? I don't know if it was an xbox only convention. Oh, we got the achievement challenger

3370
04:01:30,300 --> 04:01:34,380
I think this has done all the boxes. So we don't have to do the boxes if we don't want to

3371
04:01:35,500 --> 04:01:37,500
um

3372
04:01:37,820 --> 04:01:41,340
Are you I was about to say are you mine?

3373
04:01:43,020 --> 04:01:45,020
Hi, baby

3374
04:01:45,180 --> 04:01:48,540
Are you coming aboard all aboard the reef link farm?

3375
04:01:50,220 --> 04:01:53,580
Not to be confused with gen 3's mouse conductor from wheeler

3376
04:01:56,220 --> 04:01:58,780
Little roast head. Oh, yeah, give me that head

3377
04:02:00,700 --> 04:02:02,700
21 achievements

3378
04:02:05,260 --> 04:02:08,620
I forgot about my other sign which oh, this is why I can't play my game. Hold on

3379
04:02:09,580 --> 04:02:17,100
Well, that's a messy sign which oh my god, there's like cream ever bed. No ranch everywhere. I've got ranch on the sign which I'm so american

3380
04:02:18,460 --> 04:02:23,900
Oh, let me get a the salad and then push it on a ranch on it and then negate the whole point of the salad

3381
04:02:23,900 --> 04:02:25,340
Yeah, let me go

3382
04:02:25,340 --> 04:02:26,700
Me if I'm in america

3383
04:02:26,700 --> 04:02:31,420
Actually, the girls were saying if I ever came to america they're taking me to azura in particular

3384
04:02:31,420 --> 04:02:35,500
It was like I have so many places to take you if you ever come to america and I'm like, bro

3385
04:02:35,500 --> 04:02:40,940
I need to grow some balls and stop having to be wrong. Okay. I'm gonna take a big bay. Let me rotate the camera

3386
04:02:40,940 --> 04:02:42,940
So there's stuff to look at in the garden

3387
04:02:43,900 --> 04:02:48,940
Oh, look at that beautiful. Oh, it's done. It's very dark in the garden, but don't worry about it. Okay big bay

3388
04:02:51,740 --> 04:02:53,740
Oh

3389
04:02:54,780 --> 04:02:56,780
Hey level 31

3390
04:02:57,020 --> 04:02:59,020
Oh

3391
04:03:01,900 --> 04:03:05,100
You got a cheese piece, what does that mean? I got

3392
04:03:06,220 --> 04:03:08,940
spicy chicken cheese with salad and ranch

3393
04:03:11,660 --> 04:03:16,460
And just normal bread. I know people go a bit crazy over the bread, but I just like normal like plain bread

3394
04:03:17,820 --> 04:03:20,220
There's a fan made successor to biva pañata

3395
04:03:20,860 --> 04:03:24,380
Being made called return to parody. Wait is it on it right now?

3396
04:03:27,740 --> 04:03:30,380
I will boot that set up

3397
04:03:35,260 --> 04:03:39,500
Thank you for hanging. Good night. Please rest well again if you're

3398
04:03:41,020 --> 04:03:46,060
Lurking and hanging on by a thread. Please don't worry. This is an endurance stream

3399
04:03:46,060 --> 04:03:49,420
Please get the rest you need to do or do that little activity you need to do

3400
04:03:49,660 --> 04:03:54,220
Do you need to go and make your bed or change your sheets? I'll still be here if you go do that now

3401
04:03:54,620 --> 04:03:57,580
You need to get yourself a glass of water. I'm still gonna be here

3402
04:03:58,380 --> 04:04:03,180
Do you need to open up anything you need to do for your college assignment? I'm still gonna be here

3403
04:04:05,340 --> 04:04:07,340
I'm not out yet

3404
04:04:11,660 --> 04:04:13,660
Can you hear the cucumber in my toes?

3405
04:04:14,380 --> 04:04:16,380
Oh

3406
04:04:23,260 --> 04:04:26,060
Are you eating that foot long because I can give you one foot free

3407
04:04:35,100 --> 04:04:38,140
I want to be here. Anyway, I'm tired and strongly recharge his name

3408
04:04:38,460 --> 04:04:41,580
I love when the reeflands are like currently watching you in 1.5

3409
04:04:41,580 --> 04:04:45,740
So I can catch up and I'm like, oh my god. The dedication isn't saying like, thank you

3410
04:04:45,980 --> 04:04:49,820
I'm so glad that like I can appeal to you in that way

3411
04:04:58,380 --> 04:05:00,860
Oh the big jelly beans right there in the screen

3412
04:05:03,020 --> 04:05:05,520
No, this game really is fantastic

3413
04:05:12,380 --> 04:05:16,780
No, do you want a bite too? Do you want me to spell it in your mouth?

3414
04:05:30,700 --> 04:05:32,700
Baby bird video

3415
04:05:34,300 --> 04:05:37,820
Oh, it's a funny flavor in this one. I'm not sure I like it as much as the other one

3416
04:05:39,420 --> 04:05:41,180
No

3417
04:05:41,180 --> 04:05:42,780
Feed me like a bird

3418
04:05:44,060 --> 04:05:48,620
Two times speed strongy is a tree. I feel like it's just nonstop. Yeah, but

3419
04:05:52,860 --> 04:05:58,540
Like if you speed me up the funny thing is you can probably identify when I'm making an ink joke

3420
04:05:59,340 --> 04:06:01,340
Because my voice will be

3421
04:06:04,780 --> 04:06:08,140
Like that's how you'll tell in times for like fast forward

3422
04:06:08,540 --> 04:06:11,260
That if I've got like a joke coming out of me like that

3423
04:06:14,860 --> 04:06:19,820
I've actually not had subway in years. This is like the first time going back to it

3424
04:06:20,540 --> 04:06:22,060
I had

3425
04:06:22,060 --> 04:06:24,380
a really bad subway in Scotland

3426
04:06:25,100 --> 04:06:27,260
And it just completely put me off it

3427
04:06:28,220 --> 04:06:30,140
for ages

3428
04:06:30,140 --> 04:06:33,980
But it's a bit healthier than like deep fried chicken and

3429
04:06:34,940 --> 04:06:37,660
Chips so I was like, um, hope that it's healthier anyway

3430
04:06:39,820 --> 04:06:41,820
Chipmunk strongy can't hurt you

3431
04:06:42,940 --> 04:06:44,940
strongy had time soon

3432
04:06:49,500 --> 04:06:51,500
You are my favorite

3433
04:06:52,860 --> 04:06:54,220
sir

3434
04:06:54,220 --> 04:06:56,940
How am I supposed to recover from a comment like that?

3435
04:06:58,460 --> 04:07:03,900
Story time what happened? Oh, it was just a mingin saying which like it was just minging and it was like

3436
04:07:03,980 --> 04:07:05,420
I don't know what was wrong

3437
04:07:05,420 --> 04:07:11,260
Uh suspected someone maybe dated something wrong or like none of it was fresh like it was fucking minging

3438
04:07:11,500 --> 04:07:13,500
It was just like a really bad. Oh

3439
04:07:13,900 --> 04:07:18,460
Randomly unlocked a fizzly bear. I'll take it. Hi fizzy bear a fizzly bear. Sorry

3440
04:07:22,620 --> 04:07:24,620
Okay, minging

3441
04:07:25,180 --> 04:07:28,300
I bought a calypso and it's fucking minging

3442
04:07:28,620 --> 04:07:34,780
Okay, what are we what are we doing?

3443
04:07:37,180 --> 04:07:39,180
Is that banana tree die?

3444
04:07:39,420 --> 04:07:44,620
No, I didn't thankfully jeez. I was not paying attention. Uh, right

3445
04:07:46,300 --> 04:07:48,300
Fazzly wazzly bear wazzle wazzle

3446
04:07:49,100 --> 04:07:55,420
I saw that any pictures who sees the starving their pictures on your leader phantom by the meter

3447
04:07:55,820 --> 04:08:01,100
Somebody point me to the best ass eater. That's your wavelength. I tell him

3448
04:08:02,060 --> 04:08:04,060
I tell him

3449
04:08:07,500 --> 04:08:09,500
Wait a minute

3450
04:08:10,220 --> 04:08:15,820
If a quackberry eats a gooseberry, oh no, we're doing capitalist simulator

3451
04:08:15,820 --> 04:08:20,540
We just got an achievement for well called wealthy for getting 25k coins

3452
04:08:21,100 --> 04:08:24,700
If I give a quackberry a gooseberry, he changes, right?

3453
04:08:25,900 --> 04:08:28,780
I'm like 99% sure

3454
04:08:30,140 --> 04:08:33,500
If I give him a gooseberry, he's gonna change. I'm not fuzzy

3455
04:08:34,460 --> 04:08:36,460
Come here little duck

3456
04:08:38,940 --> 04:08:41,820
Where are you no get off the trees right now

3457
04:08:44,220 --> 04:08:46,220
You've become what you saw to destroy

3458
04:08:47,500 --> 04:08:49,500
Can't believe it

3459
04:08:49,740 --> 04:08:51,740
Land already. Geez

3460
04:08:52,700 --> 04:08:55,420
Well, there we go. Whoa, I didn't even buy it

3461
04:08:58,700 --> 04:09:01,900
All right, please if my memory serves me right

3462
04:09:04,860 --> 04:09:06,860
Eat this please

3463
04:09:07,660 --> 04:09:09,660
Are you gonna change?

3464
04:09:10,780 --> 04:09:17,020
Yes, I remembered. Okay. That's what I get confused the liquid to it and that I get confused because they both come out

3465
04:09:17,420 --> 04:09:19,420
Hey purple

3466
04:09:19,500 --> 04:09:25,020
There we go. It's a juicy goose. Oh my god, guess we should be confirmed. I'm gonna call her juicy goose

3467
04:09:26,060 --> 04:09:28,060
Oh, I like that

3468
04:09:29,020 --> 04:09:31,020
I like that

3469
04:09:31,420 --> 04:09:37,580
Hello bosom gumbling. Oh, there's another one in the garden. You're gonna destroy all my flowers though

3470
04:09:37,660 --> 04:09:39,660
I don't want you to destroy them

3471
04:09:39,660 --> 04:09:44,940
Well, uh sell the ones that kind of come in all the time so we can do the money

3472
04:09:45,180 --> 04:09:47,180
Right what I need to do

3473
04:09:47,340 --> 04:09:49,340
I don't

3474
04:09:52,140 --> 04:09:55,340
I guess we'll just focus on more of the pets and then we'll level up a bit more

3475
04:09:57,580 --> 04:09:59,580
Oh, we unlocked a cow. Okay

3476
04:10:01,020 --> 04:10:03,740
God, I remember everyone's like as there is a cow as there is a cow

3477
04:10:05,180 --> 04:10:08,540
Think of another milk go for now. All you know is go look

3478
04:10:10,620 --> 04:10:15,020
Happy as a biggie. Hello biggies

3479
04:10:15,980 --> 04:10:17,980
Hello

3480
04:10:20,780 --> 04:10:25,420
Oh, yeah master romancer. Okay, we got it. So now we sell five

3481
04:10:25,980 --> 04:10:27,020
two

3482
04:10:27,020 --> 04:10:27,980
three

3483
04:10:27,980 --> 04:10:29,980
four five boom

3484
04:10:30,860 --> 04:10:32,860
And then we go get the piggies ahead

3485
04:10:34,780 --> 04:10:41,740
She's like she's like good to your bum. Oh, she's like go to your bum. I was like what she's like go to your bum

3486
04:10:42,700 --> 04:10:48,380
No, it was just really funny being like, oh, yeah milk and then everyone was like, oh cow beach ever

3487
04:10:49,100 --> 04:10:50,940
surprise

3488
04:10:50,940 --> 04:10:52,460
goat

3489
04:10:52,460 --> 04:10:54,460
And fertility got it

3490
04:10:57,500 --> 04:10:58,860
Yeah, we go

3491
04:10:58,860 --> 04:11:01,500
Okay, builder's gonna make them that I need to

3492
04:11:02,300 --> 04:11:04,300
They want a rotten hazelnut

3493
04:11:04,300 --> 04:11:06,300
Oh

3494
04:11:06,540 --> 04:11:08,540
If you want to make any item

3495
04:11:08,700 --> 04:11:10,700
Uh, rotten, rotten, it's fucking me

3496
04:11:12,140 --> 04:11:14,140
And you just tap

3497
04:11:14,300 --> 04:11:17,180
Oh my god, we're gonna unlock a harry ball

3498
04:11:19,020 --> 04:11:21,020
Like unironically we're gonna unlock a harry ball

3499
04:11:21,740 --> 04:11:29,100
I'm gonna put a few of these around because these are absolutely stunning. These are stunning. These are called birds of paradise

3500
04:11:29,820 --> 04:11:33,180
These are stunning. Right. I'm gonna say something really controversial

3501
04:11:34,780 --> 04:11:38,460
I didn't know birds of paradise were real flowers until I came to Australia

3502
04:11:39,180 --> 04:11:40,780
because

3503
04:11:40,780 --> 04:11:44,380
I was like walking past houses and I saw someone with it and I was like, oh my god

3504
04:11:44,460 --> 04:11:47,900
That's like viva pinata and I was like, oh god the gamer brain rot

3505
04:11:48,220 --> 04:11:50,540
It's obviously based after a real flower

3506
04:11:51,180 --> 04:11:58,060
Yeah, mop bucket because of it the plant doesn't thrive in a scottish climate. So I had never seen it before

3507
04:11:58,860 --> 04:12:00,860
So I was literally like

3508
04:12:00,860 --> 04:12:06,460
Oh my god, it's like viva pinata and I'm like, no, that's obviously what it's about

3509
04:12:07,900 --> 04:12:10,780
Nonsense, it's nonsense the gamer brain rot is real

3510
04:12:13,740 --> 04:12:15,740
Okay, what are we looking at? What are we looking at?

3511
04:12:16,700 --> 04:12:22,540
Okay, we need the piggies to have hazelnuts. I repeat the piggies need to eat hazelnuts

3512
04:12:23,980 --> 04:12:28,060
So again, if you want to make a rotten food instantly just tap it with the shovel

3513
04:12:28,140 --> 04:12:30,860
Don't beat it with the shovel the shovel will pop it. Okay

3514
04:12:31,900 --> 04:12:33,900
Just a little tap like this

3515
04:12:35,420 --> 04:12:41,260
But you need to make sure the pinata is nearby because the fruit will expire and basically explode

3516
04:12:41,260 --> 04:12:46,060
And no one wants to like waste their money when trying to buy resources for the pinatas to hump

3517
04:12:49,260 --> 04:12:51,260
Okay, now they've eaten that

3518
04:12:52,140 --> 04:12:54,540
A rotten chili. Okay, we'll do the chili

3519
04:12:55,420 --> 04:13:01,660
This is a bit expensive, but I'll allow it because it's giving me points. Okay, so I'm strong. Okay connoisseur. I'm sorry

3520
04:13:01,660 --> 04:13:03,660
I don't think I said thank you for that

3521
04:13:06,300 --> 04:13:09,180
To be honest, I forget what the reveal is well

3522
04:13:12,140 --> 04:13:14,140
Um

3523
04:13:14,700 --> 04:13:17,420
I've already forgotten what I am I was supposed to buy

3524
04:13:19,340 --> 04:13:21,340
Is that a vegetable?

3525
04:13:22,060 --> 04:13:24,060
Oh, it's a chili. I remember me

3526
04:13:24,940 --> 04:13:26,940
300

3527
04:13:31,020 --> 04:13:34,940
I'm sorry, you know the reason why

3528
04:13:36,460 --> 04:13:38,460
That's sorry that you

3529
04:13:39,660 --> 04:13:41,660
A 17 for a seed

3530
04:13:42,540 --> 04:13:44,860
This game is a bit too real to capitalism

3531
04:13:45,660 --> 04:13:50,460
I said starting to hurt my soul a little bit. I think we need to plant corn and pumpkin as well

3532
04:13:50,460 --> 04:13:52,540
So I'm gonna do it. I'm just gonna do it. I'm gonna send it

3533
04:13:53,500 --> 04:13:56,700
I think it's corn and pumpkin for the pig

3534
04:13:59,260 --> 04:14:02,380
I need two pumpkins and then that's all the stuff they need

3535
04:14:02,940 --> 04:14:05,980
A rotten chili literally inflation again. It's like horror bro

3536
04:14:06,780 --> 04:14:10,220
What do you mean? They can just inflate stuff but not raise wages

3537
04:14:10,780 --> 04:14:13,180
Oh, but if they raise wages everything's gonna be more expensive

3538
04:14:14,460 --> 04:14:20,220
Wages do not even increase with inflation. So what logic is that?

3539
04:14:21,180 --> 04:14:24,220
Anyway, that's just me when I see that argument

3540
04:14:26,300 --> 04:14:29,420
But anyway back to the capitalism

3541
04:14:31,020 --> 04:14:33,020
Did I wake anyone up that was sleeping?

3542
04:14:35,980 --> 04:14:40,060
I literally I see that arguing all the time and I'm like

3543
04:14:41,180 --> 04:14:44,780
Well considering they don't even do that. What's your point?

3544
04:14:46,540 --> 04:14:48,540
What is your point?

3545
04:14:49,420 --> 04:14:51,420
What's your point?

3546
04:14:53,500 --> 04:14:57,500
I'm trying to find ghosts again actual um actual um like you should seem oh

3547
04:14:58,460 --> 04:15:02,700
A platypus vtuber would go hard. Did you know the males have venom in their back feet?

3548
04:15:04,140 --> 04:15:12,220
Platypus or mammals that lay eggs and also produce breast milk and the males also have poison on them

3549
04:15:12,940 --> 04:15:15,580
Our platypus from

3550
04:15:17,100 --> 04:15:22,140
Dinosaur era unironically because they seem to do everything wrong

3551
04:15:24,220 --> 04:15:27,980
In terms of like what a mammal is and they don't really seem to care

3552
04:15:32,460 --> 04:15:35,020
Oh, no, oh he wants to eat sheep

3553
04:15:35,340 --> 04:15:40,940
They're pokemon superior, but modern currency is not real real

3554
04:15:42,620 --> 04:15:44,620
Preach to the choir because I'm singing oh

3555
04:15:47,020 --> 04:15:49,660
Keep preaching because I'm the choir. Hello

3556
04:15:51,260 --> 04:15:53,260
You're preaching to the right person

3557
04:15:55,180 --> 04:15:58,860
They're aliens also me by the way don't a fun gen to smile

3558
04:15:59,180 --> 04:16:03,020
Ha don't a fun. Well, uh, is there a don't a fun. Let's remove out smile

3559
04:16:04,060 --> 04:16:07,580
Look, I swear actually you know what I'm about to pull up a fucking meme

3560
04:16:08,140 --> 04:16:12,140
I swear if anyone is typing if the shadow people are typing anything right now

3561
04:16:12,380 --> 04:16:18,060
I'm about to pull up a meme that will absolutely dismantle everything you're about to say in your ignorance

3562
04:16:19,100 --> 04:16:21,100
In your ignorance

3563
04:16:29,100 --> 04:16:32,380
Oh, I don't know if I'm going to recall the meme enough to get it to come up

3564
04:16:34,540 --> 04:16:35,500
So

3565
04:16:35,500 --> 04:16:40,460
Right, okay. Hold on now. Let me just preference this by saying

3566
04:16:42,060 --> 04:16:44,060
You are allowed to complain

3567
04:16:44,700 --> 04:16:49,420
And see the problems you do not have to offer the solution as the fucking tiny

3568
04:16:50,140 --> 04:16:51,660
insulin insulin

3569
04:16:51,660 --> 04:16:55,180
Um tiny not insulin. That's wrong word tiny little

3570
04:16:56,140 --> 04:17:00,940
Speck you are on the map. You do not have to change anything. You're allowed to point out what's wrong

3571
04:17:01,340 --> 04:17:06,620
And whenever someone says oh, hey, this is wrong. This is the fucking argument

3572
04:17:07,500 --> 04:17:09,500
We should somewhat improve society

3573
04:17:10,300 --> 04:17:14,940
Yet you participate in this. Yes, motherfucker. We're stuck in it

3574
04:17:15,900 --> 04:17:21,740
All of us are oh my god. Sorry. I'm about to put tinfoil hat on. Ah, yes. I'm very intelligent

3575
04:17:21,980 --> 04:17:26,540
Literally go back down in that fucking well and don't come back up again

3576
04:17:26,540 --> 04:17:31,500
I know no one's are literally fighting with me right now, but I'm fighting with myself. I'm fucking losing it. I'm actually losing it

3577
04:17:33,820 --> 04:17:39,660
Uh the ton of food. Thank you for the two dollars. Uh the super chat. I rate the thumbnail 5 at 10 for effort

3578
04:17:39,740 --> 04:17:41,740
Thank you. Thank you. I did it all myself

3579
04:17:42,140 --> 04:17:44,140
I too am very intelligent

3580
04:17:44,220 --> 04:17:47,420
A goose bit. Oh, I'm gonna have to actually buy a gooseberry. Are you joking?

3581
04:17:51,900 --> 04:17:53,900
How are you today? She won

3582
04:17:54,780 --> 04:17:58,220
I thought I didn't need it. I'm shadow boxing real hard right now

3583
04:17:59,260 --> 04:18:01,260
Real true throwing hands with the air

3584
04:18:03,500 --> 04:18:08,540
That's me punching you can't see it because my model won't track my hands, but that's me punching

3585
04:18:10,060 --> 04:18:14,300
No way that pig woke up ate and went back to sleep that honest

3586
04:18:15,100 --> 04:18:21,660
Summed it up. I'm purposely holding willy hostage right now because if I open that up all the piggies are gonna go

3587
04:18:22,700 --> 04:18:23,740
and

3588
04:18:23,740 --> 04:18:30,220
It's gonna I willies like break the damn shed. I'm working on it willy. Okay. I didn't mean to make corn or pumpkin

3589
04:18:30,220 --> 04:18:32,220
I just made that up apparently

3590
04:18:32,300 --> 04:18:35,420
Literally, he's waking up and then going to sleep eating and sleeping

3591
04:18:36,380 --> 04:18:41,500
I was just drifting off. What was this about being part of a platypus society? I hope I didn't wake you up. I'm sorry. Please forgive

3592
04:18:42,860 --> 04:18:46,140
What if we all stop participating at society at once? Oh

3593
04:18:47,020 --> 04:18:51,020
If you want to start getting theoretical so once upon a time in britain

3594
04:18:52,700 --> 04:18:54,940
When greedy greedy greedy government was in power

3595
04:18:55,660 --> 04:19:02,300
They introduced what was called a window tax if your building had windows you would get taxed

3596
04:19:02,700 --> 04:19:09,580
So everyone retaliated by barring their windows closing their like patching up their windows

3597
04:19:10,220 --> 04:19:13,020
Um, and there was also another tax in the uk

3598
04:19:13,660 --> 04:19:17,980
That was everyone was like you must pay it. You must pay it. You must pay it and no one paid it

3599
04:19:18,540 --> 04:19:20,540
And then they got rid of it

3600
04:19:21,260 --> 04:19:23,740
Now if you want to come and tell me

3601
04:19:24,460 --> 04:19:29,660
Shawnee if everyone does some sort of boycott or anything like that. It's not gonna work

3602
04:19:31,020 --> 04:19:32,780
bull

3603
04:19:32,780 --> 04:19:34,780
fucking

3604
04:19:34,780 --> 04:19:36,780
shite

3605
04:19:36,860 --> 04:19:39,180
I sorry this pig is drifting

3606
04:19:40,300 --> 04:19:41,740
absolute nonsense

3607
04:19:41,740 --> 04:19:46,860
Do not come to me and tell me that none of that's if you told me if everyone went to work

3608
04:19:47,180 --> 04:19:50,860
But collectively every single person obviously in theory

3609
04:19:51,420 --> 04:19:54,620
Um, it's not actually gonna happen. You would actually need to amass like a

3610
04:19:56,060 --> 04:19:58,300
Revolt of the current government and all that it's quite hard to do

3611
04:19:58,300 --> 04:20:03,980
You know koo koo's are quite hard to do if you told me every single day. So tax season is what someday

3612
04:20:05,580 --> 04:20:07,580
I don't know when tax season is for americans

3613
04:20:07,740 --> 04:20:13,660
Um, whatever the day was and they're expecting everyone to pay tax. You're telling me if everyone collectively said

3614
04:20:14,060 --> 04:20:16,060
Mmm, no

3615
04:20:16,780 --> 04:20:18,780
That major change wouldn't happen overnight

3616
04:20:22,460 --> 04:20:24,460
You're trying

3617
04:20:25,100 --> 04:20:30,380
You're trying to tell me that if if everyone collectively said

3618
04:20:31,260 --> 04:20:36,220
Um, I'm not going to use the conglomerate of supermarkets anymore. I'm going to use

3619
04:20:36,540 --> 04:20:41,980
I'm going to start growing my own stuff and using independent markets that the supermarket prices

3620
04:20:42,460 --> 04:20:44,460
All of a sudden would start actually

3621
04:20:45,100 --> 04:20:47,100
lowering

3622
04:20:48,140 --> 04:20:50,140
Me you're trying to tell that to me

3623
04:20:52,220 --> 04:20:55,660
You think they'd rather let that stock rock

3624
04:20:56,620 --> 04:21:00,860
Then to sell at a much more affordable price and not artificially inflated

3625
04:21:01,580 --> 04:21:03,580
You're talking to the wrong person

3626
04:21:04,620 --> 04:21:08,220
Okay, how do you get 90 percent of the population do?

3627
04:21:08,220 --> 04:21:10,220
Do

3628
04:21:10,460 --> 04:21:13,820
First we tell everyone to watch fight club

3629
04:21:14,540 --> 04:21:16,540
That's where it begins. We plant a seed

3630
04:21:17,260 --> 04:21:19,260
Just like that

3631
04:21:19,980 --> 04:21:27,260
Um strong a yes, that should be your first mutiny global hypnosis technique to reach half your power honestly

3632
04:21:28,300 --> 04:21:33,180
Things work until if people go along with it if people but that's the thing

3633
04:21:34,620 --> 04:21:36,620
That's the thing can

3634
04:21:36,700 --> 04:21:39,100
Can today's society come together?

3635
04:21:40,060 --> 04:21:45,500
Because we're being uh, I mean fuck it. I I won't put the tinfoil hat on but

3636
04:21:46,540 --> 04:21:51,340
Why is there a dragonfly in here? I didn't do anything to attract you have 12 bushes in the garden

3637
04:21:52,460 --> 04:21:54,140
Not this bush

3638
04:21:54,140 --> 04:21:58,540
Uh, right. I need to expand the water because apparently that dragonfly wants to stay in safe

3639
04:21:59,020 --> 04:22:02,140
Stranny, how long have you been in Australia the cause and willy situation there?

3640
04:22:02,380 --> 04:22:05,340
Oh, I'm fully fucking aware of what them two have been up to

3641
04:22:08,380 --> 04:22:14,220
Right, okay long story short, Australia has two major supermarket brands willies and coals, okay

3642
04:22:14,860 --> 04:22:18,300
They both come out and say oh, there's there's no co- well

3643
04:22:18,300 --> 04:22:23,580
We're not artificially raising our prices and all the farmers have come out and gone

3644
04:22:23,820 --> 04:22:28,620
Um, well, that's funny because my prices haven't changed because you know supply chain's been fine

3645
04:22:29,580 --> 04:22:33,260
And then the supermarkets are like, uh, we didn't artificially cause

3646
04:22:34,220 --> 04:22:40,380
People to suffer. You know how people need food to survive and shit. Oh, they need to figure it out

3647
04:22:41,020 --> 04:22:44,940
And it's like bruv our education system doesn't even teach you about seeds other than

3648
04:22:46,060 --> 04:22:49,260
Fucking water temperature and oxygen is what they need to grow

3649
04:22:49,900 --> 04:22:54,220
You're lucky if you get told about the nitrogen situation in soil like

3650
04:22:54,780 --> 04:22:56,780
At

3651
04:22:57,100 --> 04:23:00,220
The amount of evil if you look into it like I'm sorry

3652
04:23:01,100 --> 04:23:06,220
I'm so sorry if you are ignorant to these things. I think it's best you remain ignorant

3653
04:23:07,180 --> 04:23:11,340
Because when you start to see how bad you have no idea how bad things really are

3654
04:23:12,460 --> 04:23:13,820
It's so bad

3655
04:23:13,820 --> 04:23:15,820
It's like I don't mean to be dramatic

3656
04:23:16,940 --> 04:23:21,340
But sometimes living in ignorance is the best thing you can do

3657
04:23:21,660 --> 04:23:26,700
And I don't blame anyone for not even trying to scratch the surface of what's going on behind this

3658
04:23:26,780 --> 04:23:29,020
Don't do it. It will make you depressed. Okay

3659
04:23:29,820 --> 04:23:35,660
Protect yourselves a lot of reefling find what happiness you can the passing of time is imminent. Do you understand?

3660
04:23:37,340 --> 04:23:42,940
Anyway, that's my two cents back to Viva Piniara my childhood video game. We're currently trying

3661
04:23:43,660 --> 04:23:45,660
I

3662
04:23:47,580 --> 04:23:50,460
Sold all of my red hearts. Wow

3663
04:23:51,660 --> 04:23:57,740
I sold every single red heart. Oh my god, and they're like level six. So it's gonna take forever to show up

3664
04:24:02,620 --> 04:24:05,420
I don't even get me started on what we should be taxing

3665
04:24:08,380 --> 04:24:12,060
Anyway, did you have a oh they had a baby it's coming

3666
04:24:13,180 --> 04:24:15,180
Hello, little baby

3667
04:24:15,340 --> 04:24:17,340
Hello, little piggy

3668
04:24:17,500 --> 04:24:19,500
Piggy wiggie wiggie

3669
04:24:19,980 --> 04:24:23,420
Why whoa, I never noticed the texture of this place is messed up

3670
04:24:24,060 --> 04:24:28,300
I don't think it's that wait is inside of it dirt. Is it pure dirt?

3671
04:24:29,980 --> 04:24:32,140
Learning about Viva Piniara overthrow a government

3672
04:24:33,900 --> 04:24:37,900
Is it overthrowing a government if you just

3673
04:24:38,060 --> 04:24:40,060
Just

3674
04:24:41,500 --> 04:24:43,500
It's very hard to get into the subject

3675
04:24:44,060 --> 04:24:46,860
Because I start being like oh, but I need to mention this. Oh, but I need to mention this

3676
04:24:46,860 --> 04:24:49,820
But I need to mention this and he mentioned this before people start fucking hurrying me

3677
04:24:50,460 --> 04:24:54,860
I'll shadow box harder than you can ever imagine. I'm throne. I'm going left. You fade right?

3678
04:24:54,860 --> 04:24:57,900
But I'm already going boy. You just fucking straight into my fist. Okay

3679
04:24:59,180 --> 04:25:04,620
It's basically don't have a voice for government concern probably too late. Don't well so long story short

3680
04:25:05,580 --> 04:25:08,460
Scotland wanted to leave the uk, but the vote was

3681
04:25:09,580 --> 04:25:11,580
45 to leave

3682
04:25:11,580 --> 04:25:13,100
and then as

3683
04:25:13,100 --> 04:25:18,220
Uh an an insult to injury they publicly declared so it's called holly root

3684
04:25:18,540 --> 04:25:24,300
Which is the place where like scotland government's commands from but scotland always has to get

3685
04:25:26,300 --> 04:25:30,220
Approval if you will from the united kingdom

3686
04:25:30,940 --> 04:25:32,220
i.e

3687
04:25:32,220 --> 04:25:33,500
england

3688
04:25:33,500 --> 04:25:34,700
right

3689
04:25:34,700 --> 04:25:37,580
and after the referendum

3690
04:25:38,700 --> 04:25:40,300
um

3691
04:25:40,300 --> 04:25:45,820
The united kingdom came out and we're like, oh, we'll totally give scotland more rights over what they're doing

3692
04:25:48,620 --> 04:25:50,620
Ah

3693
04:25:51,100 --> 04:25:53,100
And they gave them about

3694
04:25:53,340 --> 04:26:00,540
Like it was just pish. It was just pish. Don't get don't get started. Don't get started. Don't don't do it

3695
04:26:00,780 --> 04:26:05,340
Have fun on beaver pinata be free play childhood games

3696
04:26:06,540 --> 04:26:12,300
Lead into the nostalgia all is good in life. Okay. I promise you give yourself that happiness you desire

3697
04:26:13,180 --> 04:26:15,180
That's rough. Yeah, um

3698
04:26:15,980 --> 04:26:18,540
I was quite fun learning about politics in other countries though

3699
04:26:19,180 --> 04:26:24,540
Like when I came to australia, I was like, oh surely it couldn't be worse than the uk

3700
04:26:25,020 --> 04:26:25,980
Oh

3701
04:26:25,980 --> 04:26:27,420
Oh, no

3702
04:26:27,420 --> 04:26:29,420
Oh, I was gonna buy the crocodile thing

3703
04:26:31,260 --> 04:26:35,260
What does he want a sweet tooth? I don't have a sweet tooth

3704
04:26:36,300 --> 04:26:38,300
Oh, there's a swan. Hi

3705
04:26:39,340 --> 04:26:42,700
Why does everyone want water? This isn't a water garden

3706
04:26:44,700 --> 04:26:46,700
This isn't a water garden

3707
04:26:47,980 --> 04:26:55,180
Unfortunately, the clock has ticking the hours are going by the past increasing in future receipts possibilities decreasing the rents mounting

3708
04:26:55,340 --> 04:26:57,340
Do you understand?

3709
04:26:57,580 --> 04:26:59,580
Yeah, like saying that series don't worry about it

3710
04:27:00,140 --> 04:27:03,260
I do like that meme though, but that meme's a little too serious

3711
04:27:04,540 --> 04:27:06,540
It's a little too serious

3712
04:27:06,940 --> 04:27:09,820
Right, I'm gonna pop this and I'm uh, no

3713
04:27:11,020 --> 04:27:15,820
You're welcome to hang a boot in my garden, but didn't he be spitting up all these naughty seeds?

3714
04:27:16,860 --> 04:27:21,420
These are bad things, right? Okay. Where is that flutter scotch? I want to make him orange

3715
04:27:25,820 --> 04:27:27,820
Where's rick

3716
04:27:28,140 --> 04:27:31,980
Where's rick don't care. Where is he? I just

3717
04:27:33,020 --> 04:27:36,380
I got the notification. You're mine. You're somewhere here

3718
04:27:39,260 --> 04:27:41,900
Oh, I already had a sweet tooth. Oh, sorry buddy

3719
04:27:44,140 --> 04:27:46,140
Where I don't know where it is

3720
04:27:46,860 --> 04:27:48,860
Okay, you've eaten it. What do you want now?

3721
04:27:49,580 --> 04:27:52,780
No, you've not eaten it yet. Hold on the game's not registered. He's eating the sweet tooth

3722
04:27:53,740 --> 04:27:55,740
I don't have one

3723
04:27:58,540 --> 04:28:00,540
I don't have one

3724
04:28:00,700 --> 04:28:06,460
How do I get one right? Okay. Let's make the garden really watery. Okay

3725
04:28:07,100 --> 04:28:10,620
Oh, this has to be 20% water. Come on. The whole thing's water

3726
04:28:11,420 --> 04:28:15,660
I'm literally curving around the bend to get more water into the garden

3727
04:28:15,660 --> 04:28:17,660
I

3728
04:28:18,460 --> 04:28:21,740
Shawnee doesn't even have one never mind two literally

3729
04:28:22,700 --> 04:28:26,540
I have one in the garden, but it's not mine and I don't know what it needs

3730
04:28:27,660 --> 04:28:29,980
I don't I don't even see it. Where is it?

3731
04:28:30,700 --> 04:28:33,820
It might have got scared away by the crocodile. You know that

3732
04:28:35,180 --> 04:28:36,940
I don't see it

3733
04:28:36,940 --> 04:28:39,500
I don't see it hanging about I don't know. Can someone look up

3734
04:28:40,220 --> 04:28:42,860
Viva pinata suano requirements

3735
04:28:43,820 --> 04:28:47,180
Because I don't know what the third thing it needed was I said it wanted water

3736
04:28:47,580 --> 04:28:51,420
Right, I'm gonna have a red hot so it can fight a dragonfly whenever that boy shows up again

3737
04:28:53,980 --> 04:28:58,540
I don't know what the requirements are. It says like 20% water. I'm working on it. Okay. I'm working on it

3738
04:28:58,540 --> 04:29:00,940
The whole map is going to be water just for the water type

3739
04:29:07,100 --> 04:29:09,100
The crocodile is

3740
04:29:09,420 --> 04:29:11,420

There's another reefing out there

3757
04:30:05,980 --> 04:30:10,300
I'm afraid I don't have what will interest you into the garden, but I'm glad you're hanging out

3758
04:30:10,700 --> 04:30:15,100
What do you like and what would make you come over? Oh, it doesn't tell me

3759
04:30:16,700 --> 04:30:18,700

04:30:19,420 --> 04:30:26,700
Most valuable replaying hell. Yeah have appearance requirements have one in the garden. There are five serpent

That's so specific. Okay

3764
04:30:40,380 --> 04:30:42,380
We'll make some corn

3765
04:30:43,900 --> 04:30:46,460
And then we'll get bar to do this thing

3766
04:30:47,820 --> 04:30:51,740
Oh, wait, no, it's bro. Oh, we would have to send bar out twice for a sandwich

3767
04:30:51,740 --> 04:30:54,940
I mean, it's cheaper than buying her astronomical prices

3768
04:30:55,900 --> 04:30:57,900
And

3769
04:31:00,060 --> 04:31:05,420
Oh wait already have corn, huh? It's a small world. It's a small world

3770

Please wait, I'm pretty sure no no not start wrong one

3774
04:31:28,220 --> 04:31:33,580
If I check the journal it will tell us the land mass and if we have 20% water

3775
04:31:35,740 --> 04:31:43,500
Okay, that'll look like 20% water. Is it 10? 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10. Okay, we have 20% water

3776
04:31:44,220 --> 04:31:46,220

3777
04:31:48,060 --> 04:31:50,860
Brother come inside and she will let you come this time

3778
04:31:51,900 --> 04:31:55,740
I don't remember what I said to prompt that but you're still here for that. Okay

3779
04:31:57,260 --> 04:32:01,180
We'll do petunia because we have 23,000 which is more than enough

3780
04:32:02,140 --> 04:32:04,140
Okay, now it's time for the doggos

3781
04:32:05,100 --> 04:32:08,780
1 2 3 4 5 6 7

3782
04:32:09,900 --> 04:32:11,900

Okay, we got resident reward first that's fine. We're level 33

3784
04:32:20,060 --> 04:32:22,060
Yes, please

3785
04:32:22,620 --> 04:32:24,620
Oh two of them are awake

3786
04:32:25,500 --> 04:32:29,980
I'll just make sure it registers. Okay, there we go. I wanted to register the

3787
04:32:31,180 --> 04:32:33,180
I've got master off as well. Let's go

3788
04:32:33,900 --> 04:32:35,900
1 2 3

3789
04:32:37,340 --> 04:32:38,940
4 and 5

3790
04:32:38,940 --> 04:32:43,260
Okay, we'll do the same thing as we always do. We'll go build the doggo's house

3791
04:32:45,180 --> 04:32:47,180
And then

3792
04:32:52,220 --> 04:32:59,340
I don't know what I said to trigger that now. I feel like an mbz. No, I don't know I don't I forget literally five seconds

3793
04:32:59,340 --> 04:33:05,420
After sit like whatever I thought so I'm sorry. It's nothing to do with you. It's me. I'm the problem. I promise you. I'm the problem

3794
04:33:08,940 --> 04:33:11,100
Got house right. What do you need?

3795
04:33:12,060 --> 04:33:16,860
Has a caller. Oh, that's it. Yeah, that makes sense. They need calling and then they'll be happy

3796
04:33:19,260 --> 04:33:21,260
The second

3797
04:33:22,220 --> 04:33:26,700
That's not a bad idea. Oh wait, hold on. I'm putting it together the second reefling appeared

3798
04:33:27,820 --> 04:33:29,820
and then you said

3799
04:33:30,620 --> 04:33:33,660
Better come and say she will let you come and say, okay

3800
04:33:34,380 --> 04:33:37,180
I put the pieces together. It took me a second

3801
04:33:38,140 --> 04:33:42,540
And took me one whole second together hitting it took me a lot longer, but I get it now

3802
04:33:44,540 --> 04:33:47,100
Oh, wait, we unlocked more accessories

3803
04:33:47,820 --> 04:33:51,900
Was leveling up. I thought you just like unlocked all the accessories right away

3804
04:33:53,660 --> 04:33:55,660
Okay, and then we'll put it on another one

3805
04:33:57,020 --> 04:33:59,580
Little caller on the other one

3806
04:34:01,980 --> 04:34:03,980
And then

3807
04:34:04,860 --> 04:34:09,980
We'll see what he wants. I don't know a bone. Maybe he wants a bone

3808
04:34:09,980 --> 04:34:13,500
I think you can get a bone from the shop. Don't worry, strony. You're a watermelon. You can't

3809
04:34:14,220 --> 04:34:16,220
Ah, I knew you wanted a bone. I knew I remembered

3810
04:34:17,100 --> 04:34:21,980
Sorry, but I'm actually just so mlg this game like honestly, we're gonna get a tuna corn so quickly

3811
04:34:22,380 --> 04:34:24,380
Unicorn is like this mysterious

3812
04:34:25,500 --> 04:34:28,060
Okay, now if we tell Bart to go on the bread

3813
04:34:28,700 --> 04:34:33,500
He will turn them into sandwiches then we can get the swan and then we can get that a bad one

3814
04:34:34,380 --> 04:34:36,380
Oh, what does the mallow wheels do?

3815
04:34:38,220 --> 04:34:41,740
I don't have a pixie and I don't want them to hurt my animals

3816
04:34:42,220 --> 04:34:43,340
Oh

3817
04:34:43,340 --> 04:34:47,020
Leave reefing alone. Do not hurt my reefing. I'm so sorry

3818
04:34:47,900 --> 04:34:52,460
Right, this is going to be really mean, but we actually need to get a few achievements

3819
04:34:53,340 --> 04:34:59,900
Um, and we need Dastardos to come out. So you see the the the bat and the croola

3820
04:35:01,260 --> 04:35:03,260
The cryola pen or whoever it was

3821
04:35:04,140 --> 04:35:07,820
They need to come they need to scare Dastardos

3822
04:35:08,380 --> 04:35:12,140
Does that make sense and then we will unlock an achievement because of this

3823
04:35:12,700 --> 04:35:15,980
Cerepina is unlock achievements. Um

3824
04:35:17,420 --> 04:35:23,100
A mummy saved me. I was so scared. You're asleep. You couldn't have been scared. Did you work? Um

3825
04:35:24,300 --> 04:35:25,820

3826
04:35:25,820 --> 04:35:29,900
He bit he bit my ass. Oh no, Danny kiss your ass

3827
04:35:31,900 --> 04:35:36,380
Danny kiss it better. Wait, why am I here a bone and I've got a bone to pick with you. Give me a bone

3828
04:35:37,260 --> 04:35:38,620
Thank you

3829
04:35:38,620 --> 04:35:44,940
Well, at least they're a little bit on sale. It's not why is the bone so tight? Why am I paying

3830
04:35:46,220 --> 04:35:52,700
375 smacker runes for an atom of a bone? Am I going crazy and saying that's tiny?

3831
04:35:55,820 --> 04:35:59,180
Like what the fuck are these growers not shores like

3832
04:36:01,900 --> 04:36:03,900
Why is that so tiny?

3833
04:36:04,620 --> 04:36:09,900
Okay, I'm so sorry about that little wolf guy

3834
04:36:12,540 --> 04:36:14,540
I'm waiting for Dastardos to wake up

3835
04:36:16,140 --> 04:36:18,140
Okay, gammies on standby

3836
04:36:18,780 --> 04:36:24,620
The bat is sitting here either one is going to give an achievement. I just need them to both do it at some point

3837
04:36:25,340 --> 04:36:27,340
So I feel bad for this mallow wolf, but

04:38:37,180 --> 04:38:39,180
Uh, where is it?

3861
04:38:40,780 --> 04:38:47,180
I'm like 99% sure this is an achievement if you rename them and you can literally go. Oh, it's already called laying

3862
04:38:48,380 --> 04:38:53,100
Yes, I remember. Oh my god. I wonder if I could do this game without

3863
04:38:54,300 --> 04:38:56,940
Like older achievements without looking them up

3864
04:38:59,420 --> 04:39:02,060
24 achievements we're getting a juicy juicy dance

3865
04:39:06,860 --> 04:39:08,860

04:39:09,340 --> 04:39:14,940
Sacrifice for the greater achievements. It was a several pinata that we couldn't get yet. Oh speaking of several pinata

3867
04:39:15,660 --> 04:39:19,340

Oh my god, wait, what's going on? Go home

3870
04:39:29,740 --> 04:39:35,020
What's going on at our chaos in the skirting actual chaos is erupting in the skirting

3871
04:39:36,700 --> 04:39:38,700
Stop it. You're upsetting me

3874
04:39:47,260 --> 04:39:49,980
I think that stops ruffians from entering your garden

3875
04:39:51,420 --> 04:39:55,980
I'm like 99% sure get out. Why are they coming in pair? Wait, are you?

You can have a piggy. Oh no reefing. Do you want to go for another party?

3883
04:40:27,340 --> 04:40:31,260
I know you get nervous being the center of attention, but are you a brave boy?

3884
04:40:31,420 --> 04:40:34,460
Oh, you're currently in your house right now. Aren't you be honest? Yep

3886
04:40:51,900 --> 04:40:53,900
What is that noise?

3887
04:40:57,180 --> 04:41:00,380
Can you hear that noise as well? I think something's glitching out in the background

3888
04:41:01,340 --> 04:41:04,940
Why are we in a trash can? Oh, that's your house

3889
04:41:06,380 --> 04:41:09,740
That's where you're nice and comfy. Oh, okay. We've got a parable

3890
04:41:10,780 --> 04:41:12,780
10 bananas you greedy fuck

3891
04:41:15,660 --> 04:41:19,100
Do you know how expensive it's going to be to pay for that?

3892
04:41:21,500 --> 04:41:26,220
Oh, I leveled up though feels good man. I'm maybe having new seeds 10 banana

3895
04:41:40,620 --> 04:41:42,620

3897
04:41:47,900 --> 04:41:50,780
I think I'm gonna have to start like growing flowers and selling them

3898
04:41:56,620 --> 04:41:58,620
Oh

3899
04:42:00,140 --> 04:42:03,980
Would you go dancing with me or would you be too embarrassed to dance with me?

3900
04:42:09,020 --> 04:42:15,020
Oh, look at the wallpaper in the background got all the other piñatas on it. Oh, that was such a cute romance dance

3901
04:42:15,740 --> 04:42:18,300
Oh, they're a doggy mad dog diner

3902
04:42:19,100 --> 04:42:22,700
Oh, can we open up a viva piñata cafe, please?

3907
04:42:42,780 --> 04:42:45,740
The bird's just gonna have to eat some of the bananas for free because I don't

3908
04:42:46,300 --> 04:42:48,620
Oh, but I don't want to lose it in case I can get it

3909
04:42:51,980 --> 04:42:53,500
I can't believe it

3910
04:42:53,500 --> 04:42:54,780
The system is winning again

3911
04:42:54,780 --> 04:43:00,060
I have something I need and they're selling at an extortionate rate because they know that I don't have the resources

3912
04:43:00,300 --> 04:43:02,780
Get it right now or to make it for myself. I can't believe it

3913
04:43:03,500 --> 04:43:07,100
We're falling for the pitfalls. We are we are falling for the pitfalls, right?

3914
04:43:07,100 --> 04:43:11,660
What do you want? Are you mine yet? Has eaten two sandwiches eat up your fat bass?

3918
04:43:27,500 --> 04:43:33,580
A fully grown oak tree. I haven't even unlocked that yet. Why are you asking for things? I don't have

3919
04:43:34,300 --> 04:43:36,620
We're in the pin pinata was there

3920
04:43:37,420 --> 04:43:39,420
What do you do silver baboon?

3921
04:43:40,700 --> 04:43:42,700
You're gossiping

3922
04:43:42,700 --> 04:43:46,700
And then you make pinatas fight each other. I have no idea what a baboon wants

3923
04:43:47,260 --> 04:43:51,420
Oh, it has to lose a fight to a member of the serpent family draught. Okay

3924
04:43:52,780 --> 04:43:54,300
Okay, okay

3925
04:43:54,300 --> 04:44:00,460
I need to grow an oak tree and I have no room at the end for it. I'm going to wait until this swan eats

3926
04:44:01,100 --> 04:44:03,500

3927
04:44:05,260 --> 04:44:07,820
And then I will patch up. Okay, perfect

Right this second now

3930
04:44:14,780 --> 04:44:18,060
I'm getting stressed. Oh how the mighty have fallen literally

3931
04:44:18,780 --> 04:44:23,340
I've become the very I actually love when we play games and then I become the very thing I swore to destroy

3932
04:44:23,660 --> 04:44:24,620
Okay

3933
04:44:24,620 --> 04:44:31,660
Now that will no the crocodile can show up and I'm going to order another one of you both of your canon fodder

3934
04:44:31,740 --> 04:44:34,060
I don't care. I said what I said your canon fodder

3935
04:44:34,620 --> 04:44:37,580
Okay, we are now going to grow a freaking oak tree

3936
04:44:37,580 --> 04:44:39,580
Okay

3937
04:44:41,100 --> 04:44:43,100
We're going to grow an oak tree

3938
04:44:43,340 --> 04:44:45,340
right here

3939
04:44:45,500 --> 04:44:49,340
But we're going to move the whole over just a little bit because the tree is

3940
04:44:50,540 --> 04:44:52,540
Very big

3941
04:44:52,700 --> 04:45:00,780
Very big oak tree. I surely have unlocked the seat for an oak tree. Okay. Thank you. They're not giving me a freaking

3942
04:45:01,500 --> 04:45:03,500
That's not oak tree

3943
04:45:04,460 --> 04:45:07,980
Well, I might as well just plant this and I'll sell it off

3944
04:45:09,740 --> 04:45:15,500
There's a fight between a reason when did I even get you know what you to knock off right now. I don't care knock off

3945
04:45:18,060 --> 04:45:21,100
Yeah, you're both getting rained on because you're fucking terrible don't do that again

3946
04:45:22,140 --> 04:45:24,140
I'll actually spank them with water

3947
04:45:24,940 --> 04:45:28,300
Stroney, what is my purpose to be canon fodder? Oh my god

3948
04:45:28,300 --> 04:45:30,300
Um

3949
04:45:30,540 --> 04:45:33,180
Okay, let's level him this plan up

3950
04:45:34,620 --> 04:45:36,620
This badger cycle keeps coming in

3951
04:45:37,420 --> 04:45:39,420
But I'm not actually

3952
04:45:41,340 --> 04:45:46,620
But oh, oh, you want to know what you win for that fight being fucking sold off. Fuck you

3953
04:45:47,420 --> 04:45:49,420
Don't do that to buzzle gun

3954
04:45:49,660 --> 04:45:51,900
Buzzle gumbling. Okay, don't do that

3955
04:45:53,100 --> 04:45:55,500
Oh bonus growth already. I am doing anything

3956
04:45:56,460 --> 04:45:58,460
Eat up strongy. Are you a feeder?

3957
04:46:08,300 --> 04:46:10,300
Billy Billy

3958
04:46:11,020 --> 04:46:14,220
Oh, look at how happy they are to hatch their little pinata

3959
04:46:16,300 --> 04:46:19,580
Oh, oh, I don't have what you see

3960
04:46:22,220 --> 04:46:24,780
What does he do does he eat what does he eat?

3961
04:46:26,460 --> 04:46:28,460
I don't have a pixie yet

3962
04:46:31,020 --> 04:46:33,020
Oh, but I can make one

3963
04:46:35,900 --> 04:46:38,220
Hold on I'm having a memory

3964
04:46:40,300 --> 04:46:44,860
Hold on a second. I am having a memory

3965
04:46:45,580 --> 04:46:48,460
I've just unlocked the swan. Oh god. I'm so pure though

3966
04:46:49,660 --> 04:46:51,660
I don't have any money

3967
04:46:52,220 --> 04:46:57,420
Right, I'm gonna sell the dog soon. The dog should give me some more money. Okay

3968
04:46:58,620 --> 04:47:01,420
Well, and to see you. I see you. I'm selling you

3969
04:47:02,300 --> 04:47:04,300
I'm selling you

3970
04:47:05,260 --> 04:47:07,900
We made 1000 from that. That wasn't insignificant

3971
04:47:08,780 --> 04:47:15,980
Core memory there is a thing in willy the builders place called a like a weird house or something

3972
04:47:17,820 --> 04:47:19,820
It might be in the other one

3973
04:47:21,740 --> 04:47:23,740
Oh, no, it's not

3974
04:47:25,180 --> 04:47:27,180
Uh

3975
04:47:28,780 --> 04:47:31,980
Maybe it only unlocks after swans have shagged

3976
04:47:37,420 --> 04:47:39,420
I hate much real estate

3977
04:47:43,820 --> 04:47:45,820
Why were you

3978
04:47:46,540 --> 04:47:48,540
Wait, is this my patch of gold?

3979
04:47:49,340 --> 04:47:51,340
No, I have a big gold patch also

3980
04:47:53,580 --> 04:47:57,980
Okay, once the swans have humped each other I can make a pixie

3981
04:47:58,380 --> 04:48:04,540
Because there's like the strange building you make and then you send in a romanceable pig and swan

3982
04:48:05,020 --> 04:48:07,580
And they go inside and they create a pixie

3983
04:48:09,020 --> 04:48:13,980
Does that make sense? I'm actually gonna it's a thousand for the bird of paradise is leveled up

3984
04:48:14,460 --> 04:48:16,460
That's very big

3985
04:48:16,860 --> 04:48:19,580
Oh my god, they're little baby puppies. Yeah

3986
04:48:20,700 --> 04:48:27,100
Sparrowment run capitalism coming for you literally moth drop easy 600 right there

3987
04:48:28,700 --> 04:48:32,620
Okay, I don't mind him lurking around if he isn't gonna do anything to upset me

3988
04:48:33,900 --> 04:48:39,100
But he's gonna upset me. Oh have a pixie. Oh wait. I have a pig. Okay. I'll just keep the pig

3989
04:48:40,060 --> 04:48:42,060
Uh, I will

3990
04:48:42,220 --> 04:48:47,660
Oh reefling are you awake reefling darling? Oh reefling party time. Let's go

3991
04:48:48,620 --> 04:48:53,340
Thank you for waiting at the box for me. I may have forgotten the box was even there

3992
04:48:56,620 --> 04:48:58,620
Oh, please don't eat it right now. No, you're not gonna

3993
04:49:01,500 --> 04:49:05,180
Okay, no, he's just going home. That's fine. Did he even spit up any bad sweets?

3994
04:49:05,180 --> 04:49:08,540
I don't even think he did did he learn his lesson from last time

3995
04:49:09,180 --> 04:49:16,380
Okay, little reefling. I need you to pick up a romance suite and I'll give it to the pig and then I'm gonna get another swan

3996
04:49:18,060 --> 04:49:23,900
And then I'll make them romance and then I think we can progress to get the pixie to make the mallow a good boy

3997
04:49:24,060 --> 04:49:26,060
Okay, we're doing it

3998
04:49:29,580 --> 04:49:35,500
I don't even have enough money cover the cost for that. I guess we'll do a standard fetch quest of two

3999
04:49:36,060 --> 04:49:39,820
You thousand eight hundred. I'm definitely gonna need to start making plants because

4000
04:49:41,500 --> 04:49:44,860
Actually, where was that plant I was growing? Did I just kill it? I might know

4001
04:49:46,140 --> 04:49:48,140
I don't see it

4002
04:49:51,820 --> 04:49:58,140
Uh, I think I accidentally killed that orchid plant it may have lost this

4003
04:49:59,980 --> 04:50:02,620
Too much hydration like I may have lost hydration

4004
04:50:05,500 --> 04:50:07,580
Oh, like it was an honest mistake. I wasn't paying attention

4005
04:50:07,660 --> 04:50:13,660
I'm gonna purposefully grow a few and level them up for money because we're getting low on funds. We're getting low on funds

4006
04:50:14,940 --> 04:50:21,420
Stranny, you've been a good girl and calling us darling. What you like when I call you darlin? Oh darling reefling

streaming childhood games

4013
04:50:42,300 --> 04:50:43,420

So why did those not plant?

4017
04:50:49,820 --> 04:50:52,860
My garden's too thick. Oh no, this can't be

4018
04:50:54,060 --> 04:50:56,060
My garden's too thick

4019
04:50:56,860 --> 04:50:58,860
I

4020
04:51:00,540 --> 04:51:05,180
Was drowning with the pet names my heart can't take it. Oh, what other pet names could I call you?

4021
04:51:08,060 --> 04:51:10,540
Milk the fuck out of that reefland call them an inkling

4022
04:51:13,500 --> 04:51:17,980
So I don't that wasn't even a pet name. That was just me getting on the mic. Um

4023
04:51:20,940 --> 04:51:24,780
Sugar, I think food names, uh, you would say that fine. Um

4024
04:51:26,060 --> 04:51:28,060
I think food names

4025
04:51:28,140 --> 04:51:29,180
are

4026
04:51:29,180 --> 04:51:33,020
cute pet names like oh sugar. Oh, honey. Oh

4027
04:51:34,060 --> 04:51:34,860

4031
04:51:41,900 --> 04:51:50,140
Splitting when someone said it's not a good stream game apparently and at the extortionate prices of what nintendo offer

4032
04:51:50,860 --> 04:51:52,860
I'm not really inclined to

4033
04:51:53,820 --> 04:51:56,700
Uh, if you guys don't recommend it I don't

4034
04:51:57,660 --> 04:52:00,540

My pudding my sweet pea or sweet and sour calamari. That's very specific

4036
04:52:08,780 --> 04:52:13,020
Right, where is my red hole? I need it to beat the fuck out of this gunfly

4037

04:52:15,180 --> 04:52:17,180
I don't need to make a new one

4039
04:52:17,660 --> 04:52:18,700
You

4041
04:52:20,140 --> 04:52:22,300
Oh, this is when they actually do my tips in

4042
04:52:23,740 --> 04:52:27,900

Have a fight and lose do you understand me?

4046
04:52:45,260 --> 04:52:46,220
No

4047
04:52:46,220 --> 04:52:50,460
Get so angry. Oh, I'm so angry. Oh, how the fuck do I make you angry?

4048
04:52:51,580 --> 04:52:56,380
Yes, I did it. I did it. Okay, right. What is this swan house and why is it so

4049
04:52:57,420 --> 04:52:59,420
Extravagantly big

4050
04:53:02,780 --> 04:53:07,020
Well, we all know what party they vote for jeez who is puking

4051
04:53:08,060 --> 04:53:12,700
Not now now's not the time to puke in my garden. I'm currently trying to get a dragonfly

4052
04:53:13,580 --> 04:53:17,340
She has a bird in it. No when I get frustrated I have inverted in it

4053
04:53:19,260 --> 04:53:25,180
Okay, the swan survived. I don't mind if the swan gets eaten because I think the other swan's gonna come in

4054
04:53:26,860 --> 04:53:30,380
Um right I need to sell something

4055
04:53:31,660 --> 04:53:37,580
I mean, it's not like the the garden's like freaking ready to pop its claws. I mean, I'll sell some stuff, but

4056
04:53:38,380 --> 04:53:41,660
I'll sell the birds. Oh, no, that's what attracts the harry ball

4057
04:53:43,580 --> 04:53:50,380
I've got a sour baboon as well. I don't have time for all these sour's coming into my garden. Right. What do you do you twat?

4058
04:53:53,260 --> 04:53:57,020

04:53:58,620 --> 04:54:00,620
I've got rid of my jewel snakes

4060
04:54:01,100 --> 04:54:05,900
No, don't fight. Stop it. Don't listen to his lies. Don't listen to his lies. He's lying

4061
04:54:06,860 --> 04:54:08,860
He's lying

4062
04:54:09,340 --> 04:54:14,540
Did I sell? Oh my god, no, he's beating up the swan, but I don't have another swan

4063
04:54:16,700 --> 04:54:20,140
I can't handle the stress of this game. I don't have another swan

4064
04:54:22,060 --> 04:54:26,860
She gets so heated the bud nips us to her head. That's what she was. Remember when that person called us?

4065
04:54:27,420 --> 04:54:30,380
Oh, honestly. No, no, no, actually no having it

4066
04:54:31,260 --> 04:54:32,620

04:54:32,620 --> 04:54:34,620
I could see because I'm blocked

4068
04:54:34,700 --> 04:54:39,020
I couldn't see like I saw some replies and I was like, oh, that's a really strange reply on twitter

4069
04:54:39,100 --> 04:54:43,740
Like no one really says anything like that, but then it then I could see who you were applying to and I'm like, yeah

Well, the crocodiles ours apparently

04:54:54,380 --> 04:54:57,100
Please lose the fight. They're still not finished

4074
04:54:57,820 --> 04:55:03,740
Yeah, and I knew I didn't sell you. Um, are you strong enough to defeat the absolute loving daylight set of this baboon?

4075
04:55:05,580 --> 04:55:10,780
Wait, they just stopped fighting. Oh, did one of them get trampled?

4076
04:55:12,220 --> 04:55:14,700
I think one of them got trampled. Okay, right you

Okay, jameleon now is not the time really glad to have you buddy, but this garden is absolutely packed with

4080
04:55:28,780 --> 04:55:30,780
things that are trampling each other

4081
04:55:31,500 --> 04:55:36,460
Please okay, we are gonna sell the orchard orchards orchards

4082
04:55:39,660 --> 04:55:41,660

I'm gonna be your wait. You didn't attack the baboon

4086
04:55:56,620 --> 04:55:58,620

Attack this baboon right now

4090
04:56:04,780 --> 04:56:06,780
No, no, don't let him get away

4091
04:56:08,700 --> 04:56:12,620
Oh, we got a dragonfly. What color do you become? I forgot

4092
04:56:13,740 --> 04:56:15,340

Hmm, what what happens to pinatas when they get sold they explode into

You've been awarded a piece of the tower of sour. Yeah

4096
04:56:30,300 --> 04:56:32,300

4102
04:56:56,720 --> 04:56:58,720

snappy the client a coca-dee

4106
04:57:14,160 --> 04:57:18,000
Actually, no, I don't want to sell I want to try and make we'll make the fucking money

4107
04:57:20,000 --> 04:57:25,440
Hi refling. Oh you so tired you run over to me, but you fall asleep because you so tired

4108
04:57:25,680 --> 04:57:29,040
You watch a man during streams a little too much. Do you need to rest a little weakling?

4109
04:57:29,600 --> 04:57:31,600
I think you might need to rest

4110
04:57:37,040 --> 04:57:38,560
Oh, hi

4111
04:57:38,640 --> 04:57:43,200
You want bret? Oh, oh apparently I'm down for my 25% closer

4112
04:57:45,920 --> 04:57:48,320
But hey has been a good day for

4113
04:57:50,000 --> 04:57:54,400
If we have a crocodile vtuber, uh, that'll be her cover song at debut

4114
04:58:03,840 --> 04:58:05,840
Is my water gone home

4115
04:58:06,800 --> 04:58:10,000
I think she might have but that's okay, right so we have a bee

4116
04:58:11,600 --> 04:58:16,080
Uh, we just need to get another two swans

4117
04:58:17,360 --> 04:58:19,760
Did you bring me that sweet darling? Or did you forget?

4118
04:58:21,200 --> 04:58:24,720
Did that just grow right before it was about to pop at sweet cogs? I think so

4119
04:58:25,440 --> 04:58:29,040
Oh my god 1.8. That's pretty considerable

4120
04:58:30,800 --> 04:58:32,800
Okay rolling around like a pig in

4121
04:58:33,600 --> 04:58:38,560
And what you ask, I don't know. I'm gonna get my shelly bean

4122

Taff lye, I don't need a red hot an elephanilla

4124
04:58:48,640 --> 04:58:51,360
I can never get enough strone though. Never enough strone

4125
04:58:52,000 --> 04:58:54,800
Refling is tired because he's got work and fiber and still has to sleep

4126
04:58:55,520 --> 04:59:00,000
You should go to sleep because I'm still going to be online when you go to work. I

4127
04:59:00,720 --> 04:59:02,720
Honestly don't think I'm kidding

4128
04:59:04,000 --> 04:59:06,000
I would be very

4129
04:59:06,000 --> 04:59:08,000
careful

4130
04:59:08,320 --> 04:59:12,800
What do you want a squazzle? I actually don't even have a squazzle on pop

4131
04:59:13,680 --> 04:59:18,560
Unbelievable if I can't even upgrade. Oh, oh my god the claws

4132
04:59:19,760 --> 04:59:22,320
That's gorgeous the colors are gorgeous

4133
04:59:22,880 --> 04:59:28,560
So any house all that pent up gaming energy to let out honest real truth

4134
04:59:30,560 --> 04:59:32,560
No lies detected

4135
04:59:35,040 --> 04:59:41,840
Oh my god, that's a huge bitch. Um, that is a quote by the way whenever I say that that's a quote

4136
04:59:43,040 --> 04:59:48,480
It's a damn. That's a huge thing. I'm not saying that to be malicious. It's a quote

4137
04:59:48,720 --> 04:59:50,080
Okay

4138
04:59:50,080 --> 04:59:53,920
So I just needed to clear that up just in case uh, I'm starting

4139
04:59:54,800 --> 04:59:58,880
Someone's feelings. Anyway, I'm an architect. So fuck off. Fuck off my dick

4140
05:00:00,320 --> 05:00:02,320
Okay, I'm gonna sell these

4141
05:00:03,360 --> 05:00:05,360
We're making so much money back

4142
05:00:06,480 --> 05:00:08,640
Are you gonna come in the garden or do you not want to come in?

4143
05:00:10,080 --> 05:00:12,400
Repeat the mulling. Oh look at you weak lick

4144
05:00:13,360 --> 05:00:18,080
Yes, I'll do it all night or you are going to be ill at work. I urge you guys

4145
05:00:18,800 --> 05:00:22,400
Now when I lose sleep because I'm working that's fine. Okay

4146
05:00:23,680 --> 05:00:25,680
But when you lose sleep

4147
05:00:26,240 --> 05:00:28,240
That's nori

4148
05:00:28,240 --> 05:00:32,240
Wait, are we back to endurance streams? I'm putting off food and shower until after stream is on the sake

4149
05:00:33,200 --> 05:00:36,080
You can go food and shower and I will still be here

4150
05:00:36,800 --> 05:00:40,480
Oh, it's a bit. Look there's a baby perfectly. Um

4151
05:00:41,600 --> 05:00:46,400
I think what we'll do is we'll redirect into mercy, which is four hours away

4152
05:00:47,120 --> 05:00:50,720
So if you can handle four more hours of viva pinata, then

4153
05:00:52,000 --> 05:00:54,000
Uh smooth sailing after that

4154
05:00:55,600 --> 05:01:00,640
Well, buzzle gum number eight more like buzzle gum into the crate to be sold

4155
05:01:04,480 --> 05:01:08,000
May I'm out of on about dad have the whole floor today?

4156
05:01:09,920 --> 05:01:11,440
Oh

4157
05:01:11,440 --> 05:01:18,960
Well, I guess you're all just stuck watching me. That's right snowberries. That's right bleeding hearts. That's right harem

4158
05:01:19,520 --> 05:01:26,560
That's right snippets. That's right pin pals. You're all stuck with the oh, oh, you're not watching because you're

4159
05:01:27,120 --> 05:01:30,160
You're oh, she isn't okay. Well, I understand. We'll have anything

4160
05:01:34,240 --> 05:01:38,640
I played this for almost 24 hours straight one time. It's such a good game and to

4161
05:01:39,520 --> 05:01:41,520
I chose

4162
05:01:41,840 --> 05:01:46,480
She owns all of them. Yeah, sorry. I needed a break from doing the voices today

4163
05:01:46,640 --> 05:01:51,600
I couldn't like my voice is quite sore today. So I needed a break from doing all the voices

4164
05:01:51,680 --> 05:01:53,680
I hope that's understandable. Have a nice day

4165
05:01:58,640 --> 05:02:04,720
Right we're kind of playing a waiting game right now. I need her to come back with that freaking thing

4166
05:02:05,600 --> 05:02:08,320
But she's not and I don't know if I should put all my song

4167
05:02:09,200 --> 05:02:11,120
Into the next pinata

4168
05:02:11,120 --> 05:02:14,560
Oh serenity. Thank you so much for the redirect

4169
05:02:15,280 --> 05:02:17,280
Thank you

4170
05:02:17,760 --> 05:02:22,320
How is stream what game are you playing? But if you're exhausted, please don't feel forced to talk because

4171
05:02:23,200 --> 05:02:26,640
There's no worse than redirecting after a really long and eventful stream

4172
05:02:27,040 --> 05:02:32,480
And then the streamer is like, what were you up to and you're like too exhausted to even type out what you were up to

4173
05:02:33,200 --> 05:02:35,680
Walking dead season 2. No spoilers

4174
05:02:36,720 --> 05:02:41,600
I'm just glad. Oh, wait, weren't you not collabing with someone as well?

4175
05:02:42,160 --> 05:02:44,160
A speedy bunny raid. Hi

4176
05:02:44,720 --> 05:02:49,040
Sweetie bunnies. I'm strongy. I'm the scoosh. Yeah

4177
05:02:50,640 --> 05:02:53,360
Feveal we're gen one. Hi

4178
05:02:54,240 --> 05:02:58,560
Uh, unfortunately, mercy isn't on today or I would highly recommend mercy coming on soon

4179
05:02:59,520 --> 05:03:04,000
Love you. I was with mismar. I knew it. I knew you were collabing with someone on it. I knew it

4180
05:03:04,160 --> 05:03:06,160
Why do you don't have the wrench either?

4181
05:03:08,400 --> 05:03:11,120
Why is it when I am midstream I have to put the wrench

4182
05:03:13,360 --> 05:03:18,880
How do you I knew you had a club I knew it. I'm like, I'm such a firefighter. I must have seen it and I was like

4183
05:03:23,600 --> 05:03:25,600
Add as a moderator and then

4184
05:03:26,400 --> 05:03:30,000
Boom, she's got the wrench as it's over for you reeflings and you speak

4185
05:03:30,480 --> 05:03:33,760
What? Oh, there's a naughty piñata in my garden right now. Hold on

4186
05:03:34,720 --> 05:03:40,240
Excuse me. Just need to fix up my garden. I am playing a childhood game called viva piñata

4187
05:03:40,800 --> 05:03:42,800
And I'm currently being stressed out

4188
05:03:43,200 --> 05:03:48,080
To high heavens over the game, but in a good way like in a humorous way. What do you need?

4189
05:03:49,040 --> 05:03:51,120
A pixie. I still don't have one for you

4190
05:03:52,080 --> 05:03:56,960
Um, but we're currently doing the it's not cheatsy doodling

4191
05:03:57,200 --> 05:04:00,240
But it's the speedrun strat where you buy loads of

4192
05:04:01,040 --> 05:04:06,640
Piñatas from the shop and then you get loads of accolades for having them even though you didn't really do anything for them

4193
05:04:06,960 --> 05:04:10,720
But don't tell the game that we're doing that, but we're leveling up quite well

4194
05:04:11,200 --> 05:04:15,920
We're five hours in it's a bit of an endurance room. So please don't feel bad for clicking off or anything like that

4195
05:04:15,920 --> 05:04:17,920
I understand. I'm not your cup of tea

4196
05:04:17,920 --> 05:04:23,200
However, the evil ones always look so much cooler. Yeah, we've been transforming the sour piñatas into the good ones

4197
05:04:23,920 --> 05:04:25,600
um

4198
05:04:25,600 --> 05:04:28,080
This is some weird ass plants versus so

4199
05:04:29,120 --> 05:04:31,120
It's piñatas

4200
05:04:31,520 --> 05:04:37,360
We're currently making a house for the sheep. So the sheep can do what's called. I can't even find the sheep

4201
05:04:37,760 --> 05:04:39,760
It's called a romance dance

4202
05:04:40,320 --> 05:04:45,680
Read in between the lines if you dare. I can't even find it. I think it's not registered that I have sheep yet. Um

4203
05:04:46,640 --> 05:04:51,600
But yeah, like the so this is a sour piñata we're trying to get but I'm waiting for the

4204
05:04:53,760 --> 05:05:00,640
The hunter that grabs more piñatas to come in and help us but she's refusing to come back and

4205
05:05:01,600 --> 05:05:04,480
Oh, we're having so many issues. She has power now. Hey

4206
05:05:06,160 --> 05:05:12,480
I think you can make a pixie without meat in the composite species below before. Oh really?

4207
05:05:12,800 --> 05:05:14,800
No

4208
05:05:15,440 --> 05:05:17,120
They need to be able to be

4209
05:05:17,120 --> 05:05:20,960
Romanceable, but I can't feed a romance sweet to it

4210
05:05:21,840 --> 05:05:25,120
I can feed a romance sweet to the piñata. I think that's fine

4211
05:05:26,000 --> 05:05:29,600
We're currently trying to make a super awkward combination

4212
05:05:30,320 --> 05:05:33,200
It's just nonsense on it play. Oh, we have an old tree

4213
05:05:34,160 --> 05:05:37,520
We might be able to get in a clear the eagle layer thing

4214
05:05:39,120 --> 05:05:41,120
Okay, let's pop it in

4215
05:05:42,480 --> 05:05:45,040
Now this thing's gonna take a hot second to grow

4216
05:05:46,000 --> 05:05:47,520
Which is fine

4217
05:05:47,520 --> 05:05:51,040
Sorry, I'm late. Don't worry. We just bing ching. Don't you want bing ching?

4218
05:05:53,280 --> 05:05:59,120
Um, we actually just unlocked uh, unicorn tree, which is

4219
05:05:59,920 --> 05:06:04,000
Um, actually kind of big. Um, so I'm gonna make one over here

4220
05:06:04,480 --> 05:06:06,480
Although the problem with this game is

4221
05:06:07,040 --> 05:06:10,240
The garden runs out of memory. They limited it

4222
05:06:10,240 --> 05:06:13,520
So you can't have like too many things all at once. I'm getting a forehead

4223
05:06:15,680 --> 05:06:22,320
I just need to get unlock a squazzle unbelievable a level four piñata squazzle. I've not unlocked

4224
05:06:23,120 --> 05:06:25,120
But

4225
05:06:25,920 --> 05:06:28,560
Okay, and now we've got a unicorn tree coming in as well

4226
05:06:28,560 --> 05:06:30,960
But that oak tree is so beautiful

4227
05:06:31,040 --> 05:06:36,160
You can kind of see it now, but it has like all the piñatas on it the designer

4228
05:06:36,880 --> 05:06:42,240
Cooked when it comes to this in particular like they did insane

4229
05:06:43,520 --> 05:06:46,800
How well they did with the the concept of that tree

4230
05:06:49,360 --> 05:06:53,360
New leaflings are discovered every week. Yeah, we're getting more leaflings in the garden

4231
05:06:53,760 --> 05:06:58,480
We're doing the perfect farm life, but we just need to get these sheep to hump

4232
05:06:59,920 --> 05:07:05,920
And there's no other way to say it. They're going to hump and I need them to eat this flower in order to do so

4233
05:07:06,320 --> 05:07:09,920
I don't know. It's like an aphrodisiac put some in the middle or something. I don't know how it works

4234
05:07:10,560 --> 05:07:12,560
I don't question sheep

4235
05:07:13,760 --> 05:07:15,280
Sheep's ways

4236
05:07:15,280 --> 05:07:17,280
Where is the other flower?

4237
05:07:18,160 --> 05:07:22,960
I've lost it. I'm just gonna plant now. I've lost the dying flower. That's the only thing

4238
05:07:25,440 --> 05:07:28,400
Well, it should be there somewhere, but I guess not

4239
05:07:30,720 --> 05:07:34,560
All right, we'll break this plant in order to get it your garden's getting very full

4240
05:07:34,560 --> 05:07:37,600
Yeah, see this is the problem. Oh, and I

4241
05:07:38,400 --> 05:07:44,000
Just broke the flower that I needed because everything's popping up all at once. Okay. Okay. Yes. Yes

4242
05:07:44,800 --> 05:07:48,160
Okay, take well take snappy on a holiday because he's

4243
05:07:48,880 --> 05:07:50,880
I'm gonna have to sell some of this stuff

4244
05:07:53,360 --> 05:07:55,360
Okay, one more time

4245
05:07:56,400 --> 05:07:58,560
There we go, right you

4246
05:08:00,080 --> 05:08:02,080
Where is the other

4247
05:08:03,040 --> 05:08:05,040
There's not you

4248
05:08:08,160 --> 05:08:15,840
What was I feeding it's disappeared. Oh a sheep. I was feeding a sheep. Sorry, right you eat a water lily flower. Yeah

4249
05:08:18,320 --> 05:08:20,560
Times like this we need the insight of a will smith

4250
05:08:22,000 --> 05:08:24,000
Reef land

4251
05:08:26,880 --> 05:08:28,880
Reef land

4252
05:08:28,880 --> 05:08:35,760
Come on in big spender's welcome window. What am I supposed to respond to that? Oh wait, what was the flower one?

4253
05:08:36,400 --> 05:08:38,400
That was kind of funny

4254
05:08:39,040 --> 05:08:44,160
To poison ivy flowers. Okay poison ivy flowers

4255
05:08:46,080 --> 05:08:50,480
Well still mention poison ivy flower

4256
05:08:52,240 --> 05:08:54,240
Poison ivy seeds

4257
05:08:54,640 --> 05:09:02,560
And it need two flowers. So I need to plant four seeds now. Everyone. Please evacuate from the that you

4258
05:09:03,120 --> 05:09:08,800
Get the heck out of here. I don't want to see anyone walking in this direction whilst the nasty flowers are growing

4259
05:09:08,800 --> 05:09:12,880
These are bad flowers. They're bad for your health. I don't want anyone getting sick

4260
05:09:13,760 --> 05:09:17,200
Because you got too close to the poison ivy flowers. I need them to grow

4261
05:09:17,920 --> 05:09:23,360
So they flower like the wee head of it flowers and then we'll deal with the rest. Okay

4262
05:09:25,040 --> 05:09:28,960
Sweet bun red. Yes. Thank you again, serenity. I hope you have a good rest

4263
05:09:29,600 --> 05:09:32,880
After your stream and misma too actually, um

4264
05:09:33,840 --> 05:09:36,080
I have some exciting news about misma guys

4265
05:09:39,040 --> 05:09:45,920
Oh, I have some exciting news about misma. Oh, but you don't get to find out until next week. Oh

4266
05:09:48,560 --> 05:09:53,200
I am horning in on these weeds so deeply and harshly

4267
05:09:54,800 --> 05:09:56,800
Please

4268
05:09:58,320 --> 05:10:04,000
Once it gives the achievement for them being grown. Oh my god, you can literally see them getting ready to poison my purpinatas

4269
05:10:04,640 --> 05:10:06,640
Oh, they're coming out

4270
05:10:07,040 --> 05:10:08,080
Oh

4271
05:10:08,080 --> 05:10:15,200
See dos not right now. Please don't please don't admire the weeds in my garden. That's rather embarrassing for

4272
05:10:15,760 --> 05:10:21,520
For like a plant connoisseur. That's quite embarrassing right once they see the flower on the top once that blooms

4273
05:10:21,520 --> 05:10:25,760
We are beating the crap out of these weeds. Okay. I just need it to bloom

4274
05:10:27,360 --> 05:10:30,800
Not now raison. It's gonna end up having a fight with my bubblegum

4275
05:10:32,160 --> 05:10:35,600
Everyone stay away. Are you joking?

4276
05:10:37,040 --> 05:10:40,160
He went to sleep in between the poisonous flowers

4277
05:10:42,080 --> 05:10:47,520
I'm getting trolled. He went to sleep in the poisonous flowers

4278
05:10:48,080 --> 05:10:50,080
Is

4279
05:10:50,640 --> 05:10:52,640
Coming back for more

4280
05:10:52,880 --> 05:10:56,240
You see the ai in this game. I could actually fart on it. I really could

4281
05:10:58,560 --> 05:11:01,600
Wait, I only ended up getting two flower heads for that

4282
05:11:04,160 --> 05:11:06,640
Did two of them not come up? Am I going crazy?

4283
05:11:09,920 --> 05:11:11,120
Oh dear

4284
05:11:11,120 --> 05:11:14,640
Right, I think I need three birds of paradise to attract the haribo again

4285
05:11:14,880 --> 05:11:18,480
So I'm gonna plant two more because it'd be shame for all these bananas to go away

4286
05:11:20,960 --> 05:11:24,720
But of course the pinyas elder fighting back there and I'm trying to do 10 things the one

4287
05:11:25,920 --> 05:11:34,160
Yummy poison literally they're like, oh that smells so good and like their lungs are being mustard gassed right now by these poison ivy plants

4288
05:11:36,000 --> 05:11:39,440
Please get out of the way. Please get out of the way. Please

4289
05:11:45,600 --> 05:11:50,240
Do I need a fir tree anymore? I don't think so. I'm gonna get rid of it because it's getting in the way

4290
05:11:51,680 --> 05:11:53,680

4291
05:11:54,320 --> 05:12:00,080
Right you have served your purpose. I'm gonna keep gammy sherbet. Thank you for your service. You've done fantastic

4292
05:12:00,080 --> 05:12:02,080
We're super happy. What are these?

4293
05:12:02,160 --> 05:12:07,600
The bananas that are going through has eaten two poison ivy flowers, right? You eat this right now

4294
05:12:08,000 --> 05:12:11,600
And then I'll see what I need to do with you

4295
05:12:12,160 --> 05:12:18,080
Gamble no the sweet embrace of poison. I'm pretty sure in england. There's like this uh location

4296
05:12:20,400 --> 05:12:22,560
That's dedicated to um

4297
05:12:23,200 --> 05:12:28,320
Poisonous plants and like people pass out when they visit it and stuff of long grass

4298
05:12:29,280 --> 05:12:30,880
I don't

4299
05:12:30,880 --> 05:12:32,400
Long grass

4300
05:12:32,400 --> 05:12:35,280
I don't I've not even purchased long grass. Hold on a minute

4301
05:12:37,840 --> 05:12:42,400
There we go long long grass seed packet. Oh, it was only a thousand anyway. I was in big deal

4302
05:12:43,440 --> 05:12:48,560
Yeah, there's like somewhere in england. It's like got a garden that's specifically for like the most poisonous plants ever

4303
05:12:48,880 --> 05:12:50,880
Right, we're just gonna spray this down

4304
05:12:51,680 --> 05:12:54,000
And then hopefully the sheep will be happy

4305
05:12:55,360 --> 05:12:58,320
It doesn't really matter where we put it at the end of the day

4306
05:12:59,840 --> 05:13:05,760
I'll put it around your home little reefland so you can be camouflaged and then you've got extra privacy

4307
05:13:06,240 --> 05:13:09,280
And no one can peep through your peeping what you're doing

4308
05:13:10,880 --> 05:13:15,600
It's real. It's a gardening museum greenhouse place. Yes. See and yeah, I wouldn't yeah

4309
05:13:16,160 --> 05:13:22,880
Whoa, I forgot the the sprinklers away. I'm sorry. Please forgive. Please forgive. Please forgive. Please forgive. I'm not done yet

4310
05:13:22,880 --> 05:13:25,120
I'm not done yet. I'm not done yet. I'm not done yet. I'm not done yet

4311
05:13:26,160 --> 05:13:28,640
I need to go do the oak tree. I completely forgot

4312
05:13:29,440 --> 05:13:33,120
Oh, please don't be perishing. Okay, you're fine. You're actually not doing that bad after admit

4313
05:13:33,120 --> 05:13:35,520
You're doing pretty well. All things considered you're doing well

4314
05:13:36,480 --> 05:13:42,720
Okay, and now I'm going to put the fertilizer on both the gem tree and the other one

4315
05:13:45,040 --> 05:13:48,000
The place is Alton wick garden

4316
05:13:48,800 --> 05:13:50,160
I

4317
05:13:50,160 --> 05:13:52,560
I'll take your word for it because I actually don't know what it is

4318
05:13:52,560 --> 05:13:58,080
But you wouldn't tell me several times reefling. Don't eat candy. Just because you find it on the floor. It's dangerous

4319
05:13:59,200 --> 05:14:01,200
Don't be a silly Billy

4320
05:14:02,160 --> 05:14:05,760
Okay, I don't have a picture yet. I'm working on it. I'm working

4321
05:14:07,120 --> 05:14:09,760
See, this is the problem. If you don't get expressed

4322
05:14:10,320 --> 05:14:14,480
She is out for like days at a time. It's ridiculous

4323
05:14:15,840 --> 05:14:19,120
My gardening level 38 broken pina

4324
05:14:23,120 --> 05:14:27,680
I'm going to say something controversial. It was a reason that just got broken. Um

4325
05:14:31,600 --> 05:14:33,600
Oh, he's like singing to himself

4326
05:14:37,360 --> 05:14:39,360
Yeah

4327
05:14:39,680 --> 05:14:41,680
I think he's losing it

4328
05:14:42,400 --> 05:14:47,040
Oh, please candy. What if you take it from a child? No, I'll just buy you what you need reefling

4329
05:14:47,920 --> 05:14:49,920
Oh, you picked up some candy

4330
05:14:50,560 --> 05:14:52,560
I need to get you uh

4331
05:14:52,720 --> 05:14:54,720
A spider

4332
05:14:55,120 --> 05:14:57,120
Whoopsies I forgot about these two

4333
05:14:57,520 --> 05:14:59,520
Uh

4334
05:15:00,400 --> 05:15:02,960
Do you think the game forgives me for being really bad at playing it?

4335
05:15:04,720 --> 05:15:08,800
As soon as the sprinkler girl goes home, it's over for me

4336
05:15:10,960 --> 05:15:13,600
But this is gonna be a big boy. Look at me

4337
05:15:17,200 --> 05:15:19,200
Uh

4338
05:15:19,440 --> 05:15:21,440
What I need I need a sheep's home

4339
05:15:22,160 --> 05:15:26,720
Surely the sheep's home's there now. I couldn't find it last time. Hold on. Let me open my eyeballs

4340
05:15:30,240 --> 05:15:32,240
Oh

4341
05:15:36,560 --> 05:15:40,640
I'm a dumb dumb. I was looking for the white color, but oh god, this is too big

4342
05:15:45,680 --> 05:15:52,560
Is there anywhere in the garden that will fit I mean not really I had to make everything freaking water

4343
05:15:57,280 --> 05:15:59,280
Um

4344
05:16:00,240 --> 05:16:02,960
Yeah, I kind of had to make everything water

4345
05:16:03,760 --> 05:16:06,080
because someone not naming names

4346
05:16:06,640 --> 05:16:08,640
A dragonfly

4347
05:16:08,800 --> 05:16:12,000
Was being so specific with the requirements. I had to change

4348
05:16:13,840 --> 05:16:17,920
You've made more space so you can continue to grow. I mean did I?

4349
05:16:19,760 --> 05:16:21,760
I don't really recall making more space

4350
05:16:23,360 --> 05:16:27,920
I sold a few plants and stuff. I don't know. Maybe the game's being pernickety

4351
05:16:29,520 --> 05:16:35,920
I mean, you're also just not running any water upgrade. True. Shoot. There's the sprinklings doing all for me

4352
05:16:38,000 --> 05:16:40,480
Okay, have it now is this enough room

4353
05:16:42,480 --> 05:16:47,520
Is that a two by two in terms of we've up now one two one two a little bit more on this side

4354
05:16:49,280 --> 05:16:52,160
Okay, and then we can get a sheep home

4355
05:16:53,760 --> 05:16:55,440
Okay

4356
05:16:55,440 --> 05:16:59,600
Award for growing a gem tree. Oh, it's a gem tree a tree of gems

4357
05:17:03,520 --> 05:17:06,000
Goobah looks good as goobah

4358
05:17:08,880 --> 05:17:10,880
Oh 39

4359
05:17:12,320 --> 05:17:15,520
Don't mind me lucky 39

4360
05:17:16,240 --> 05:17:18,240
I'm getting there

4361
05:17:18,320 --> 05:17:20,320
Ah, yes

4362
05:17:21,840 --> 05:17:23,840
Right, we're gonna fertilize the tree

4363
05:17:24,480 --> 05:17:30,800
But we're yeah, I mean like come on. Look at the stunning magnificent gorgeous

4364
05:17:32,080 --> 05:17:34,080
Uh bonus for award

4365
05:17:35,600 --> 05:17:39,040
Right, what do you want? Do you still want tons of grass?

4366
05:17:40,240 --> 05:17:45,600
Okay, we just need you to eat poison ivy. So I'm going to grow

4367
05:17:46,480 --> 05:17:54,560
Two more poison ivy and everyone is going the ai is not going to lock my pinatas onto the poison ivy

4368
05:17:55,920 --> 05:18:00,000
Because the ai seems to be loving it. Okay, so we're gonna do it

4369
05:18:01,040 --> 05:18:05,840
Over here where no one is lurking. Okay, we're gonna post multiple

4370
05:18:08,480 --> 05:18:10,480
Okay, we're gonna sell you

4371
05:18:10,880 --> 05:18:12,880
And we're gonna tell you

4372
05:18:13,040 --> 05:18:14,480
you

4373
05:18:14,560 --> 05:18:16,560
No, go over here

4374
05:18:18,080 --> 05:18:21,040
Leave this area alone. This is for the sheep only

4375
05:18:22,640 --> 05:18:27,200
Sprinkling maybe you can come over as long as you don't start. Why not make an island for the poison?

4376
05:18:27,520 --> 05:18:33,920
I just need the flower heads so I can't like bring it over or anything. I just need the sheep to

4377
05:18:35,120 --> 05:18:38,640
bump uglies and then I can move on to the next thing

4378
05:18:39,600 --> 05:18:44,320
Once this freaking hunter comes back. She's still away. This is like day two

4379
05:18:44,480 --> 05:18:46,880
She's been away for trying to get this swan

4380
05:18:48,320 --> 05:18:52,560
No work for the sprinkling how much do these trees sell for a thousand?

4381
05:18:54,400 --> 05:18:55,920
Hmm

4382
05:18:55,920 --> 05:18:58,560
The plants honestly do better than a tree

4383
05:18:59,680 --> 05:19:02,320
Only upgraded at once with a fertilizer, but still

4384
05:19:05,280 --> 05:19:07,280
I can see wait, uh, uh, uh, oh

4385
05:19:07,280 --> 05:19:11,280
Oh, everyone's super interested in this corner of the garden all of a sudden. Hmm

4386
05:19:11,600 --> 05:19:17,840
I'm wonder if it's to do with the ai and all locking onto the freaking you freaking bricks

4387
05:19:20,480 --> 05:19:27,040
I don't want these plants a roryl. Oh an orio. Okay, that's a good one hydration chain

4388
05:19:30,240 --> 05:19:32,240
I'm not gonna guess any of my pinyas

4389
05:19:33,280 --> 05:19:36,480
They're just the ai's help in on getting hurt on a plan

4390
05:19:36,880 --> 05:19:39,520
Restive of gardeners can attract a roryl

4391
05:19:40,240 --> 05:19:47,920
The roryl will only appear and there are lots of different types of pinyasas living in the garden. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay

4392
05:19:51,120 --> 05:19:53,920
Is she coming to water these yeah, I didn't think so go back

4393
05:19:56,080 --> 05:19:57,200
Okay

4394
05:19:57,200 --> 05:20:01,040
So I guess they don't have a hundred percent drop rate, which is fine

4395
05:20:01,120 --> 05:20:09,200
They don't as if that I swear if that butterfly was about to like drop right next to one of these poisonous plants, okay

4396
05:20:11,280 --> 05:20:13,840
Okay, there we go. I can see the flower head on all of them

4397
05:20:16,320 --> 05:20:21,920
Okay, that one didn't drop one that's okay that one didn't drop one. It was a 50 50

4398
05:20:27,040 --> 05:20:29,040
Is this how I'm supposed to do

4399
05:20:31,200 --> 05:20:33,200
Oh

4400
05:20:36,960 --> 05:20:38,960
Yeah, yeah, yeah, gammie wait

4401
05:20:41,440 --> 05:20:48,720
That's literally why I planted four we just lost like a 50 54 times in a row. This is why we don't play belcher

4402
05:20:50,160 --> 05:20:52,160
That was uh, come on

4403
05:20:55,120 --> 05:20:57,120
Well, look do be in the air

4404
05:20:58,080 --> 05:21:00,080
Luck me in my ass tonight

4405
05:21:00,560 --> 05:21:02,560
Luck be in the air tonight

4406
05:21:02,560 --> 05:21:07,600
Oh wait the garden literally is refusing to spawn anything more. Okay

4407
05:21:08,640 --> 05:21:11,920
I think that's why the flower heads didn't spawn there

4408
05:21:13,200 --> 05:21:18,640
That was a meme. I just quoted. I did not just randomly come out with that. Please understand. I just quoted a meme

4409
05:21:18,800 --> 05:21:20,800
I am so sorry for the confusion

4410
05:21:21,200 --> 05:21:27,120
That is a meme it was like that game show and the quote was like luck be in the air tonight

4411
05:21:28,560 --> 05:21:29,920
um

4412
05:21:29,920 --> 05:21:31,360
and

4413
05:21:31,360 --> 05:21:33,360
It looked like

4414
05:21:33,360 --> 05:21:35,920
F me in the arse tonight or something like that

4415
05:21:37,360 --> 05:21:43,760
I'm just selling like all of these flowers because oh everything is complete exploding in front of me

4416
05:21:46,480 --> 05:21:50,480
Uh, uh, okay, everything's getting too old in my garden

4417
05:21:50,800 --> 05:21:52,800
I

4418
05:21:54,400 --> 05:21:57,280
Break the shed. I'll break it in a minute when I'm ready. I'm not ready yet

4419
05:21:58,320 --> 05:22:02,240
Oh, we can get a brown flutter scotch actually. I need to remember that

4420
05:22:04,320 --> 05:22:06,320
Um

4421
05:22:07,120 --> 05:22:12,960
I um my garden's falling apart. You're tearing me apart. Be open. Yeah

4422
05:22:15,920 --> 05:22:19,200
Please tell me the game registers that I have made space now

4423
05:22:21,040 --> 05:22:28,560
Kind of be arsed with it being like you've got any space but expansion. I have you be all bad. You've made space. I'm right. Uh-huh

4424
05:22:30,320 --> 05:22:33,200
Oh, I need to buy freaking bananas for this bird as well

4425
05:22:34,160 --> 05:22:36,880
She knows all the memes because the brain roll. She's just like me

4426
05:22:39,360 --> 05:22:45,200
Okay, I'm getting ready for belch roll. I actually don't know when we're next gonna play belch roll

4427
05:22:45,600 --> 05:22:47,600
Oh

4428
05:22:47,920 --> 05:22:50,640
Right, what's that like three bananas

4429
05:22:51,920 --> 05:22:54,720
One two three four five six seven

4430
05:22:55,840 --> 05:22:57,840
Eight nine ten. You're welcome

4431
05:22:58,240 --> 05:23:00,240
Gorge scaven

4432
05:23:00,400 --> 05:23:02,880
I call beaver. What did I do to erin it?

4433
05:23:04,400 --> 05:23:06,400
I don't really know but as long as you're happy

4434
05:23:07,360 --> 05:23:09,360
I'll sell you little chris room. Oh

4435
05:23:11,120 --> 05:23:13,120
And we made a bit of pocket money

4436
05:23:15,920 --> 05:23:19,040
I did not hit her stony. I did not. Oh, hi

4437
05:23:20,400 --> 05:23:23,040
Oh, hi mark. Congrats if your name's mark

4438
05:23:25,680 --> 05:23:27,680
Mark mark mark

4439
05:23:29,760 --> 05:23:31,760
Right poison ivy

4440
05:23:32,800 --> 05:23:34,800
Let's try

4441
05:23:35,040 --> 05:23:39,520
Again, wait if I plant the poison ivy and this harryable

4442
05:23:40,480 --> 05:23:46,880
Uh, sorry parable like b-lines to the thing and gets itself sick. I will be even more regional

4443
05:23:48,400 --> 05:23:51,440
I would read even harder actually. I'll read choices hard

4444
05:23:53,680 --> 05:24:00,000
I still need the pig. I mean snappy does the game think snappy's taking up a lot of room

4445
05:24:00,880 --> 05:24:06,640
Maybe they think your house is taking up a lot of room reform. I know I don't want to get rid of this one place yet either

4446
05:24:07,520 --> 05:24:12,240
Because when this hunter day three this hunter has been away never again

4447
05:24:13,920 --> 05:24:15,920
Honestly

4448
05:24:16,000 --> 05:24:18,640
I'm afraid up with this world everyone betrayed me

4449
05:24:21,200 --> 05:24:26,320
You seem to be genuinely enjoying this game. Oh, uh, it's my childhood game. I adore it. It's like

4450
05:24:26,960 --> 05:24:33,840
It's such a gift and a gaffe but trying to get the ai to do what you want sometimes is rough

4451
05:24:34,800 --> 05:24:38,320
Sometimes you are pleading with the ai over level 40

4452
05:24:43,360 --> 05:24:46,480
Did we unlock a seed for being level 40 please tell me we did

4453
05:24:47,760 --> 05:24:49,760
She's gonna victors. No

4454
05:24:52,080 --> 05:24:55,280
Geez how many we grew a plant we didn't really do them

4455
05:24:55,360 --> 05:24:59,200
I was gonna say it gave us like five rotations on who goes there on the clock

4456
05:24:59,920 --> 05:25:01,920
um

4457
05:25:02,480 --> 05:25:04,980
Oh, I just want this parable to join

4458
05:25:06,400 --> 05:25:11,840
I actually want to keep him because he's so colorful. So i'm gonna add ling to his name dragon sly ling

4459
05:25:12,640 --> 05:25:13,920
what

4460
05:25:13,920 --> 05:25:18,480
No strany you can't just add i and g uh, you can't just add ling to the end of everything to make a reef ling

4461
05:25:18,560 --> 05:25:20,560
Yeah, watch me

4462
05:25:21,360 --> 05:25:23,120
I don't know if snappy needs to go

4463
05:25:23,200 --> 05:25:28,800
I don't know if the game considers him taking up space because he's thought he is a big pinata. There's no doubt about it

4464
05:25:29,760 --> 05:25:32,080
I did not hit her. I did not oh hi

4465
05:25:34,560 --> 05:25:38,960
I mean the garden is looking a bit bad and to be honest other than the plants

4466
05:25:40,400 --> 05:25:41,680
Right you

4467
05:25:41,680 --> 05:25:45,120
Welcome to the club. Goodbye. Thank you for coming

4468
05:25:46,000 --> 05:25:51,840
Right you right poison ivy right. We're gonna do the poison ivy that harry bull is long gone. Let's

4469
05:25:52,640 --> 05:25:55,200
Get these sheep to touch each other

4470
05:25:56,000 --> 05:25:58,000
produce a baby sheep

4471
05:25:58,320 --> 05:25:59,520
and then

4472
05:25:59,520 --> 05:26:03,600
We will get rid of the sheep and then we will get that freaking swan

4473
05:26:04,960 --> 05:26:08,640
I don't know. I'm like dab fucking plant a fifth one as well just to make sure

4474
05:26:09,280 --> 05:26:11,680
Surely the drop rate of five

4475
05:26:13,040 --> 05:26:14,800
is enough

4476
05:26:14,800 --> 05:26:17,840
Surely are you awake at night when everyone's asleep?

4477
05:26:18,720 --> 05:26:20,720
Are you at night? I will refund

4478
05:26:21,200 --> 05:26:23,200
Oh, hi, mum

4479
05:26:23,840 --> 05:26:28,400
I absolutely love the who goes there to the burps. It's just my humor. I was so childish

4480
05:26:28,480 --> 05:26:34,960
I was like, obviously I was the one who burped. So why am I like identify yourself as if you're like some intruder coming to like

4481
05:26:35,200 --> 05:26:37,200
Ka-blam or me

4482
05:26:38,720 --> 05:26:43,520
All I heard was touch each other. Oh you zoning out, but that brought you back in. Oh, yeah

4483
05:26:44,640 --> 05:26:46,640
Ah

4484
05:26:47,200 --> 05:26:49,200
Oh

4485
05:26:50,640 --> 05:26:53,200
Maybe bubblegum should get his own house at one point

4486
05:26:54,080 --> 05:27:00,400
It's funny. Thank you. Thank you for enjoying my terrible humor. It's good. I'll be here all week. Thank you. Thank you

4487
05:27:00,960 --> 05:27:02,960
You know, I'm gonna say something controversial

4488
05:27:03,760 --> 05:27:05,760
I think I'm actually getting a wee bit tired

4489
05:27:06,480 --> 05:27:10,080
Yeah, see this is what I was worried about if I stopped doing endurance

4490
05:27:10,880 --> 05:27:16,000
That I would start getting tired and what are you perching on gammy?

4491
05:27:16,640 --> 05:27:18,640
You're sideways

4492
05:27:19,040 --> 05:27:21,200
Oh, someone's spitting up in the garden. Hold on

4493
05:27:22,320 --> 05:27:26,240
Stop it. I still don't have a pixie. You can hang out, but please stop it

4494
05:27:28,560 --> 05:27:35,440
I've lost my stat. Literally. I'm like, oh my god. I'm like getting a wee bit tired. I don't want to disappoint you though

4495
05:27:36,480 --> 05:27:42,560
Imagine strut tired stroney. I don't even know what's wrong. Literally. I'm like, oh my god. This is what happens when you don't

4496
05:27:46,400 --> 05:27:49,040
Are the flower heads there? It must be

4497
05:27:50,480 --> 05:27:52,480
Just because it's night

4498
05:27:54,560 --> 05:28:01,040
Drop rate. Okay. Drop rate confirmed. It was literally because our garden was full

4499
05:28:04,160 --> 05:28:06,160
Literally because the garden was full

4500
05:28:07,600 --> 05:28:09,600
We have learned

4501
05:28:10,560 --> 05:28:17,440
When stuff stops, but so seeds and flower heads all add up. Please don't come near the

4502
05:28:18,400 --> 05:28:21,600
Oh, well, I mean, I guess if you really wanted to right, okay

4503
05:28:22,640 --> 05:28:26,720
We can make the sheep pump. I repeat the sheep are humping and pumping

4504
05:28:29,200 --> 05:28:30,800
Okay

4505
05:28:30,800 --> 05:28:36,960
Break the shed will he give me one second. I literally need to tell the sheep to eat some flowers you

4506
05:28:37,520 --> 05:28:39,520
Go eat that

4507
05:28:40,720 --> 05:28:42,560
And you

4508
05:28:42,560 --> 05:28:46,560
Go stand next to them. So you's are ready when I'll break the shed open

4509
05:28:47,600 --> 05:28:49,840
It's one of the things we got build back up the time

4510
05:28:49,840 --> 05:28:56,160
I honestly think so like I was going to be like, oh, well redirect into mercy and then I think that's roughly like nine hours

4511
05:28:56,400 --> 05:29:00,320
Which I think is a good warm up endurance stream type thing

4512
05:29:01,360 --> 05:29:03,360
um

4513
05:29:04,320 --> 05:29:06,320
Oh, hey you

4514
05:29:07,760 --> 05:29:09,760
Wake up

4515
05:29:10,560 --> 05:29:16,640
Go to your boo, right? He's asleep there with the spine and then you have already eaten that

4516
05:29:17,520 --> 05:29:19,520
And then you just need a house, right? That's fine

4517
05:29:22,000 --> 05:29:24,000
Okay, then you

4518
05:29:24,800 --> 05:29:27,440
And you kiss right now

4519
05:29:28,800 --> 05:29:32,000
Oh, because you can't shake when you go to bed

4520
05:29:34,320 --> 05:29:36,320
That's so smart

4521
05:29:36,720 --> 05:29:40,800
This game is just so loved and created by the development team

4522
05:29:41,280 --> 05:29:45,440
We need to train mummy little by little until she gets her stamina back real and sure

4523
05:29:45,520 --> 05:29:49,520
I literally I'm like, I need a nap before I record the audio for you. I'm not even kidding

4524
05:29:51,040 --> 05:29:53,040
Right, okay, what's going on here?

4525
05:29:53,680 --> 05:29:54,880
Oh

4526
05:29:54,880 --> 05:29:56,880
Okay

4527
05:29:57,520 --> 05:30:00,800
I'm I'm I'm trying I'm dumb. Okay. I'm so dumb

4528
05:30:01,440 --> 05:30:04,240
Okay, let's just make sure we get the the romance and out the way

4529
05:30:05,840 --> 05:30:11,040
Astronomy you can do literally anything. We'll love you for a couple years ago. I could go with three-hour sheep nerves

4530
05:30:11,600 --> 05:30:13,840
If I don't get eight, I feel like I'm dying

4531
05:30:17,840 --> 05:30:21,200
It's hard like I guess it's just like a tame thing

4532
05:30:23,040 --> 05:30:28,240
I've got an ojisan reefling. I'm kidding. I'm just teasing. I'm teasing. You're actually not that old

4533
05:30:31,760 --> 05:30:33,760
Hey

4534
05:30:34,240 --> 05:30:36,240
That's so cute

4535
05:30:45,680 --> 05:30:49,680
And are they having like those floating dreams lucid dreaming was that what that was

4536
05:30:50,560 --> 05:30:52,560
Start floating

4537
05:30:52,560 --> 05:30:55,680
Oh, is the zero in 30 minutes? I thought she was

4538
05:30:56,640 --> 05:30:58,640
On to do am I going crazy

4539
05:31:00,800 --> 05:31:05,040
I'm not losing it. Oh, is there's gonna membership anime stream?

4540
05:31:06,960 --> 05:31:10,640
Okay for any bleeding hearts is there's gonna membership is uh anime

4541
05:31:11,920 --> 05:31:14,400
Watch long stream something with number eight in it

4542
05:31:15,680 --> 05:31:19,360
Yeah, it's a member only stream unfortunately. Oh, so technically I'm not the only one

4543
05:31:21,040 --> 05:31:23,040
My achievements

4544
05:31:23,040 --> 05:31:25,040
You have earned a new rank

4545
05:31:25,680 --> 05:31:27,680
ultimate gardener

4546
05:31:28,480 --> 05:31:30,800
So that's the max level

4547
05:31:33,200 --> 05:31:37,360
We're not gonna get anything more like we've unlocked everything we could now at this level

4548
05:31:38,640 --> 05:31:40,640
I don't know

4549
05:31:40,880 --> 05:31:46,080
At least it's dreams when you're aware that you're dreaming mid-dream. Yeah, I have never

4550
05:31:47,360 --> 05:31:49,360
Had one

4551
05:31:50,560 --> 05:31:53,760
I don't know how you induce it, but that seems pretty cool

4552
05:31:53,920 --> 05:31:59,200
I feel like you could do anything you want and I'd probably go straight for sex

4553
05:32:02,480 --> 05:32:04,480
I'm trying to kid

4554
05:32:04,480 --> 05:32:10,160
Now go straight. Oh, oh, I thought that was the size of the sheep. I'm like, oh my god. It's tiny

4555
05:32:10,640 --> 05:32:13,120
Right. Don't complain that I'm selling your house. Okay

4556
05:32:14,320 --> 05:32:17,120
Don't complain of soldier house or I'll cry

4557
05:32:18,080 --> 05:32:20,080
It makes me more upset

4558
05:32:21,680 --> 05:32:24,240
She day four and she's still away

4559
05:32:26,240 --> 05:32:30,080
Bruh, I ain't gonna want the damn swan by the time you come like with it. Jesus

4560
05:32:32,720 --> 05:32:34,480
You want a sweet tooth?

4561
05:32:34,480 --> 05:32:39,600
I actually can't help you because gretchums fetchums is refusing to fetch them

4562
05:32:39,920 --> 05:32:43,360
So I'm stuck here with nothing for what you want

4563
05:32:43,360 --> 05:32:48,560
Please just eat the bananas. I've bought you so many

4564
05:32:49,520 --> 05:32:51,760
I had it once but woke up almost immediately

4565
05:32:52,560 --> 05:32:56,880
When the bank takes away the hoops. Oh, no. Is that when I sell their hoops?

4566
05:32:57,760 --> 05:32:59,760
No, scrawny. Why did you invite this?

4567
05:32:59,840 --> 05:33:01,840
They're sheep. You're not sheep

4568
05:33:02,800 --> 05:33:06,560
You're this little guy. Where is it? Is he asleep right now? Oh, you're asleep right now

4569
05:33:07,120 --> 05:33:09,120
Let's take a peek at your leaflin

4570
05:33:09,520 --> 05:33:11,520
Oh, you're showing me your tuckus

4571
05:33:12,480 --> 05:33:17,840
You sure? Oh, look at the way you're looking back at me leaflin. Come on. If that's not consent. I don't know what is

4572
05:33:18,880 --> 05:33:20,880
Look at those eyes

4573
05:33:21,440 --> 05:33:25,120
scrawny that azure stream says you're a part of it by the way

4574
05:33:33,280 --> 05:33:35,280
Sorry, hold on

4575
05:33:36,160 --> 05:33:38,160
You can't be I'm not sure anymore

4576
05:33:42,320 --> 05:33:44,320
That is nothing

4577
05:33:48,000 --> 05:33:50,160
I don't see I can't see it because I'm not a member

4578
05:33:54,480 --> 05:33:56,560
I'm not a part of azure stream

4579
05:33:57,680 --> 05:33:59,680
What hold on

4580
05:33:59,840 --> 05:34:03,440
Does she actually think I'm a part of her stream? She's doing a membership stream

4581
05:34:12,400 --> 05:34:14,400
Is

4582
05:34:16,000 --> 05:34:19,120
It says was scrawny I'm watching anime with her. No, I'm not

4583
05:34:28,560 --> 05:34:30,560
Like I can't watch anime with her

4584
05:34:31,760 --> 05:34:33,760
Hey, is there a

4585
05:34:34,880 --> 05:34:38,960
Hey, is there a I'm not watching anime

4586
05:34:39,920 --> 05:34:45,360
Anime with you and your membership stream, right?

4587
05:34:46,800 --> 05:34:49,600
I think we might have gotten confused

4588
05:34:50,960 --> 05:34:52,960
I'm not watching anime with her

4589
05:34:54,640 --> 05:35:01,120
Why why why does she think I'm watching the anime with her? Hold on. I don't need you

4590
05:35:09,440 --> 05:35:13,680
I'm waiting for her to reply. We spoke last night

4591
05:35:16,400 --> 05:35:18,400
Who's fighting now?

4592
05:35:22,000 --> 05:35:26,800
Um, I am so nervous right now about disappointing her. I'm ready to fart

4593
05:35:28,320 --> 05:35:32,640
My stomach is twisting because I I think I might have miscommunicated and she thought I was

4594
05:35:33,360 --> 05:35:35,840
Maybe a copy and paste from her collapse the other day

4595
05:35:36,720 --> 05:35:38,720
I'm sorry

4596
05:35:39,840 --> 05:35:43,600
Bleaching hearts are telling me the title

4597
05:35:44,480 --> 05:35:50,080
says with scrawny, but I don't know if that's just uh

4598
05:35:51,280 --> 05:35:54,320
Coffee and paste from last collab stream

4599
05:35:55,520 --> 05:35:57,520
She's not replying to me, but she's one one

4600
05:35:59,200 --> 05:36:01,200
I think she made a coffee then paste

4601
05:36:01,840 --> 05:36:03,840
Okay, we've got a boobin

4602
05:36:03,920 --> 05:36:09,440
Oh my god, it's naked gross and will right now. Oh my gosh

4603
05:36:11,680 --> 05:36:14,320
A bonbon well, I'm gonna sell you your work

4604
05:36:16,160 --> 05:36:20,320
Okay, you have done your job. What do you want a squazzle? I might make you two or four

4605
05:36:21,920 --> 05:36:23,920
Is that parry ball mine yet?

4606
05:36:25,360 --> 05:36:29,280
You thank you for telling me that by the oh the parry balls mine. Let's go

4607
05:36:30,240 --> 05:36:32,240
Parry ball

4608
05:36:33,440 --> 05:36:37,360
Naked oh, that's such a good joke if you didn't know a baby she was called a youth

4609
05:36:40,640 --> 05:36:44,000
Actually good 37th the K coins. I'm actually

4610
05:36:46,240 --> 05:36:49,840
Oh, look at it. Oh, it's quite big colors

4611
05:36:53,680 --> 05:36:57,920
Well, I can sell these as we're about to pop their clothes. I'll sell them there

4612
05:36:58,880 --> 05:37:00,880
We were using them to attract

4613
05:37:04,400 --> 05:37:08,080
Right now let's deal with these ridiculous swans

4614
05:37:10,720 --> 05:37:15,040
I mean to be fair azura hasn't messaged me being like hey see you in an hour or like

4615
05:37:15,120 --> 05:37:20,640
Because whenever you do a collab with someone if you didn't know you actually show up an hour before and just hang out and chat with each other

4616
05:37:21,200 --> 05:37:22,880
um

4617
05:37:22,880 --> 05:37:30,480
Right, we're gonna do oh a parry ball is a higher. Oh a bond boom and a parry ball are actually higher tier than a cinemunki and a swan

4618
05:37:34,400 --> 05:37:38,080
Uh, right you you want a fountain in order to meet

4619
05:37:41,280 --> 05:37:43,280
Okay

4620
05:37:45,280 --> 05:37:51,280
Like oh, I can't do the woman. Oh, she's typing. She's typing discord leaks discord leaks. She's typing

4621
05:37:53,840 --> 05:37:55,840
I

4622
05:37:57,600 --> 05:38:00,800
I swear if she turns around you she's like I thought we were watching it together. I'm gonna be like

4623
05:38:05,120 --> 05:38:08,640
I'm gonna cry for you. I love you, but that's not

4624
05:38:12,800 --> 05:38:14,800
Okay

4625
05:38:14,960 --> 05:38:20,320
Okay, she said no, it's so misty. Okay. Thank god. Okay, bless. Okay

4626
05:38:21,280 --> 05:38:24,720
Okay, bless your cotton socks. I'll

05:38:26,080 --> 05:38:27,360

05:38:27,360 --> 05:38:33,760

05:38:39,120 --> 05:38:42,240
Weep and then put in a bracket affectionately

4631
05:38:42,640 --> 05:38:44,640
Oh

4632
05:38:50,080 --> 05:38:52,400
What was that in the background of my game?

4633
05:38:54,960 --> 05:39:00,960
Don't ever say that again. I've just closed this girl down. So she talks to me. Sorry deserve can't see it. I closed this gourd

4634
05:39:03,120 --> 05:39:04,880
Night

4635
05:39:04,880 --> 05:39:06,880
Kai g number eight

4636
05:39:07,440 --> 05:39:09,440
What the fuck I thought you were drinking

4637
05:39:09,760 --> 05:39:14,320
No, that was like her in the background right the swan wants a diamond choker

4638
05:39:15,040 --> 05:39:17,040
Interesting. Why would you want a choker?

4639
05:39:18,080 --> 05:39:20,080
Choker hardly even know her

4640
05:39:26,240 --> 05:39:30,480
Okay, then I guess I really am trying with you. I really am

4641
05:39:34,480 --> 05:39:35,520
Right

4642
05:39:35,520 --> 05:39:41,600
Oh, you want water lilies. Yeah that thing that I don't have that's specifically what you want

4643
05:39:45,440 --> 05:39:48,560
That's specifically what you want water lilies that I don't have

4644
05:39:50,400 --> 05:39:52,400
Okay, I'm gonna plant these

4645
05:39:54,240 --> 05:39:57,840
I'm gonna fertilize them so they give me three flowers each

4646
05:40:00,640 --> 05:40:04,240
This one what's the color like you mine still hasn't come through I'm waiting for it

4647
05:40:05,920 --> 05:40:07,920
Ah

4648
05:40:08,240 --> 05:40:12,080
I decided to get one version strongy one version roofland

4649
05:40:13,840 --> 05:40:15,840
Is that okay?

4650
05:40:16,160 --> 05:40:18,160
Some paper

4651
05:40:21,200 --> 05:40:25,680
Yeah, right I've got two flowers for the swan

4652
05:40:27,360 --> 05:40:32,960
Which is currently heading for its house. So maybe don't go in your house like right at the second. That'd be great

4653
05:40:36,320 --> 05:40:38,320
Okay

4654
05:40:38,320 --> 05:40:42,160
And then next no no no no no eat that one too

4655
05:40:43,120 --> 05:40:44,720
and then

4656
05:40:44,720 --> 05:40:48,960
Then that should be you okay, and then we're gonna over water the f out of these plants

4657
05:40:48,960 --> 05:40:50,880
So they don't perish in the middle of the night

4658
05:40:51,680 --> 05:40:53,680
And then that means when the next one shows up

4659
05:40:54,000 --> 05:41:00,000
We will have the water lilies and then we can put a romance suite on the peg and one on this one

4660
05:41:00,240 --> 05:41:03,600
And then we can purchase the mystery house and then we can get a pixie

4661
05:41:04,000 --> 05:41:08,800
And then the mallow wolf will become one of us one of us one of us

4662
05:41:13,040 --> 05:41:16,160
That thing I sold 15 minutes ago and I was waiting on the downhunter

4663
05:41:19,040 --> 05:41:21,040
Use whichever one makes you feel best

4664
05:41:22,000 --> 05:41:25,520
It's never bad to get a backup thing. Yeah

4665
05:41:26,160 --> 05:41:29,920
That means I can change it out because I can like do pov stuff and it's like you and your caller

4666
05:41:30,480 --> 05:41:31,920
you know

4667
05:41:31,920 --> 05:41:36,960
Or like I wear your name type stuff like you can do it the way you want, okay

4668
05:41:37,680 --> 05:41:39,680
I am

4669
05:41:41,440 --> 05:41:44,160
Going to get rid of one banana tree

4670
05:41:46,800 --> 05:41:53,600
And then we have three trees in the garden one of them being a big oak tree which is absolutely humongous humongous what?

4671
05:41:54,480 --> 05:41:57,920
And we can sell the sheep because we no longer need the sheep

4672
05:41:58,640 --> 05:42:07,360
Um, oh my god, it's so tiny and cute. Look at the way it's spread out on it's me leggy. Oh the parents do it too

4673
05:42:10,960 --> 05:42:12,960
It's so tiny and clean

4674
05:42:17,520 --> 05:42:20,400
I think we're just kind of waiting for stuff to happen unfortunately

4675
05:42:20,880 --> 05:42:26,240
So we better if I wait again. I've still not got your pixie stop throwing up naughty sweets in my garden

4676
05:42:26,320 --> 05:42:28,320
Please it takes so long

4677
05:42:28,320 --> 05:42:30,320
Okay hydration check

4678
05:42:39,840 --> 05:42:42,320
I will have your pixie soon, please

4679
05:42:44,000 --> 05:42:46,000
No, you made me hit my tulip

4680
05:42:47,040 --> 05:42:49,040
No, you made me hit you

4681
05:42:51,920 --> 05:42:55,120
What's better than roses on a piano

4682
05:42:56,480 --> 05:43:02,240
Two lips on your guard. Oh fuck two lips two lips on your organ

4683
05:43:06,080 --> 05:43:13,440
The deal I fucked up the delivery but the joke's still there. Okay. I'm sorry. I fucked up the delivery so badly. I'm sorry

4684
05:43:15,200 --> 05:43:18,800
I I put myself on the spot and I made myself scared

4685
05:43:19,680 --> 05:43:21,680
I

4686
05:43:23,040 --> 05:43:28,640
I fumbled that so badly. I got so excited to tell the joke. It always happens

4687
05:43:29,680 --> 05:43:37,040
Whenever I have a good joke to tell I always stutter my way through it and ruin the the freaking delivery of the joke

4688
05:43:38,400 --> 05:43:40,400
Oh, why am I born like this?

4689
05:43:42,000 --> 05:43:44,000
Oh wait, did I just buy it the next thing?

4690
05:43:44,560 --> 05:43:47,440
Well, oh sell. No buy it. Yeah

4691
05:43:48,240 --> 05:43:51,040
Sure, okay. I think I just bought and sold them. I think

4692
05:43:51,600 --> 05:43:53,040
Shawnee's

4693
05:43:53,040 --> 05:43:57,120
60% a joke is in the delivery. I know I know

4694
05:44:00,080 --> 05:44:02,080
I absolutely twatted it up

4695
05:44:02,800 --> 05:44:09,360
Couldn't have done any worse if I tried. Oh, we're at 30k. Hello. This capitalism simulator isn't actually so bad

4696
05:44:10,320 --> 05:44:12,320
I'm not fuzzy

4697
05:44:14,000 --> 05:44:15,040
Is

4698
05:44:15,040 --> 05:44:21,040
I think the oak seed is the last one. So if we want to make more money, I think we need 100k on our pocket

4699
05:44:22,720 --> 05:44:27,520
Oh wait, wasn't I trying to go something? Oh, yeah these I'll grow these first

4700
05:44:29,280 --> 05:44:30,880
Uh

4701
05:44:30,880 --> 05:44:32,880
I already checked the thing out

4702
05:44:33,360 --> 05:44:35,040
I did you go on that

4703
05:44:35,120 --> 05:44:38,880
Honestly delivering certain is great for shoo men our little girl failure

4704
05:44:39,120 --> 05:44:46,240
I wondered why everyone was saying that she's a girl failure. I don't really know what the terminology means

4705
05:44:48,000 --> 05:44:50,000
like

4706
05:44:50,080 --> 05:44:54,960
Uh on the cookie clip someone was like, oh my god, they're all girl failures

4707
05:44:54,960 --> 05:44:59,200
But in an affectionate way and I'm like, I actually don't know what that means

4708
05:45:01,120 --> 05:45:03,120
Oops, I don't know what I mean

4709
05:45:03,920 --> 05:45:05,120
I

4710
05:45:05,120 --> 05:45:11,120
Heart for strong a little she beats the girl failure. She recalls herself one. She was on twer's 100% of girl failure

4711
05:45:11,520 --> 05:45:14,560
What does that mean? What is it translated?

4712
05:45:15,120 --> 05:45:17,120
special terminology I should know

4713
05:45:17,680 --> 05:45:20,720
Or is it just like a kind of one of those things where it's like, oh, you're doing

4714
05:45:21,920 --> 05:45:27,040
Hey, thank you again anonymous for that tip to tell me about that. Yes. It was a namey

4715
05:45:27,040 --> 05:45:32,320
I thought maybe because I spoke to her yesterday like just in a voice call. We're just chatting away. Um

4716
05:45:33,840 --> 05:45:35,120
and

4717
05:45:35,120 --> 05:45:37,920
I was just helping her out with a few things when it comes to planning

4718
05:45:39,040 --> 05:45:45,440
And I thought when you said that she maybe thought I was going to show up on stream with her just to help her through it or whatever

4719
05:45:45,920 --> 05:45:48,080
I was like, uh, no

4720
05:45:50,320 --> 05:45:55,280
Oh my god, that's the cocoon that that looks awful

4721
05:45:56,960 --> 05:45:59,520
POV me after the reflins have had a go on me

4722
05:46:00,880 --> 05:46:02,880
Just a gape

4723
05:46:02,960 --> 05:46:08,240
Girl failures or girl failure is a slang term referring to the opposite of a girl boss

4724
05:46:08,720 --> 05:46:16,400
Simply defined as an absolute loser of a female character via a viral tweet sent in january 2023

4725
05:46:17,360 --> 05:46:19,360
A girl or a woman who is

4726
05:46:19,600 --> 05:46:21,600
adherently pathetic or an

4727
05:46:22,720 --> 05:46:28,240
You don't like anime. No, I do like anime, but the problem is I

4728
05:46:29,200 --> 05:46:36,240
Need to watch things that don't have a billion spin-off episodes and all that stuff. Wait, where's your fur?

4729
05:46:38,400 --> 05:46:40,400
Are you feeling grown?

4730
05:46:43,120 --> 05:46:45,760
Oh, maybe it can like

4731
05:46:46,960 --> 05:46:49,440
It spur grows and you can like harvest it

4732
05:46:50,000 --> 05:46:54,000
I think that's what it is. You can put them through a processing plant and then they'll come naked

4733
05:46:54,240 --> 05:46:59,360
There we go, we're at 37,000 smack a rune

4734
05:47:01,360 --> 05:47:07,200
Please keep that alive. I need it for a lot of feed them stuff to grow fur. Okay

4735
05:47:08,240 --> 05:47:13,120
Um, I wanted to actually watch anime streams with you guys

4736
05:47:13,920 --> 05:47:15,920
and

4737
05:47:16,000 --> 05:47:18,000
because

4738
05:47:18,400 --> 05:47:23,360
Uh, there's like lots of anime that I've been interested in but I've just never had the time to do it

4739
05:47:23,360 --> 05:47:25,360
so if we ever do like

4740
05:47:26,560 --> 05:47:28,560
Oh, you'll never guess what's gonna happen to you

4741
05:47:29,200 --> 05:47:31,200
Time to turn brown

4742
05:47:32,720 --> 05:47:34,720
Go go go

4743
05:47:34,720 --> 05:47:38,240
And then that's all the colors of the flutter scotch unlocked

4744
05:47:40,000 --> 05:47:44,320
Um, but yeah, whenever we have like an endurance stream where we want to watch something in the background

4745
05:47:44,320 --> 05:47:49,440
Or maybe we could just straight up watch anime together like an endurance marathon anime kind of thing

4746
05:47:49,920 --> 05:47:52,400
I'm so down to that like so down to that

4747
05:47:53,520 --> 05:47:58,160
No work for the sprinkler. Oh boy. I have good news for you. I've just planted a new seed

4748
05:47:59,840 --> 05:48:01,840
She helped with the brown noise

4749
05:48:05,680 --> 05:48:10,000
Yeah, I know you're watching would be so fun. Yes, you can watch me turn into a weeb in real life

4750
05:48:11,520 --> 05:48:13,520
I flash before your eyes and I'm like

4751
05:48:24,320 --> 05:48:30,160
Oh, yeah, we want me exactly think twice before you consume anime

4752
05:48:31,040 --> 05:48:33,040
I'm teasing

4753
05:48:33,120 --> 05:48:35,840
No, not the thing. Ah, you can't say that

4754
05:48:36,720 --> 05:48:38,320
um

4755
05:48:38,320 --> 05:48:41,920
Right, I'm waiting for these plants to grow stems

4756
05:48:43,440 --> 05:48:45,920
Eh the flower heads and then I'm gonna bring

4757
05:48:47,120 --> 05:48:49,120
a bumblebee

4758
05:48:49,440 --> 05:48:51,440
More than just a fantasy

4759
05:48:52,320 --> 05:48:54,320
Do puru puru

4760
05:48:54,400 --> 05:48:56,400
Are you going back inside?

4761
05:48:58,000 --> 05:48:59,360
Well

4762
05:48:59,360 --> 05:49:03,680
I mean, I kind of don't want you to be inside right now. Yeah, I was gonna say I'd rather you guys are out here

4763
05:49:03,760 --> 05:49:06,000
Because I'm about to unlock these flowers for you

4764
05:49:07,920 --> 05:49:13,520
Wait starting doing the cute and funny boys. I mean if I ever get a lollipop model, I'll just fuck around with that boys

4765
05:49:17,440 --> 05:49:19,440
I

4766
05:49:20,400 --> 05:49:22,400
I

4767
05:49:25,280 --> 05:49:27,280

05:49:55,840 --> 05:49:57,840
No, that's so funny

Dear god, I get it

05:50:02,640 --> 05:50:07,440
We're gonna send you off. Thank you for your contribution to the farm

4774
05:50:09,920 --> 05:50:12,000
Uh, can you grow already?

Give me a flower right now

4777

I love when you trample around and then you just fall asleep like wherever you find yourself

05:50:26,160 --> 05:50:28,160
You're like, I'm exhausted after streams, please

Mods unwiggle his balls. What?

4782

Our balls wiggled

4783
05:50:45,120 --> 05:50:47,120
What did he mean by that

4784
05:50:50,800 --> 05:50:54,640
Unwiggle unwiggle what does that mean?

4785
05:50:58,240 --> 05:51:02,080
Okay, I need the swans to come and eat the flowers

4786
05:51:03,840 --> 05:51:08,320
Unwiggle his balls. What the fuck is this like

4787
05:51:09,200 --> 05:51:14,080
Boys, let's confuse the girls terminology and I've just been pranked because I'd believe it

I'd a whole heartedly believe it right swans you

4789
05:51:25,120 --> 05:51:29,280
Right, we're gonna have this freaking pixie for this mallow wolf. We're so close

4810
05:53:16,000 --> 05:53:17,440
torsion

4811
05:53:17,440 --> 05:53:20,960

Why do you need so much water just to like do a little dance with each other?

4816
05:53:36,480 --> 05:53:38,480
You don't attack

4817
05:53:38,640 --> 05:53:41,360
As long as you don't twist the tubes

4818
05:53:44,480 --> 05:53:48,320
The delivery tubes from the testies to the spout

4819
05:53:53,200 --> 05:53:57,200

Okay, is this enough for the dang swans? I won't know until they come out if they're not out right now

4826
05:54:33,680 --> 05:54:36,640

4827
05:54:37,600 --> 05:54:40,480

4876
05:58:08,240 --> 05:58:10,640

4881
05:58:26,240 --> 05:58:28,240
Oh

4882
05:58:28,640 --> 05:58:33,840
It's very controversial and not recommended. Here we go. See we did it

4883
05:58:43,200 --> 05:58:45,200
What does the inside of their house look like?

I just don't want you hurting yourself. You I'm poison

4890
05:59:05,760 --> 05:59:10,080
That's like saying you're lactose intolerant and then you're huffing like as much cheese as possible

4891
05:59:11,360 --> 05:59:14,480
Like come on replay and be kind to yourself

Oh my gosh, they're so oh black swan

05:59:43,840 --> 05:59:45,840
Oh, sorry

4897
05:59:45,840 --> 05:59:47,840
You

4898
05:59:47,920 --> 05:59:53,120
Actually, I can't believe it. I can't believe I've lost my endurance state. I think I'm gonna have to hand it to a zero on ironically

4899
05:59:54,720 --> 05:59:56,720
I'm starting to feed. I'm starting to crash

4900
05:59:58,800 --> 06:00:00,800
Okay, so now that they've meted

4901
06:00:01,840 --> 06:00:05,840
Does the game acknowledge the place I need to buy

4902
06:00:06,400 --> 06:00:08,400
Morning

4903
06:00:13,920 --> 06:00:16,160
Mystery home there we go

4904
06:00:17,600 --> 06:00:19,600
It's humongous of course is

4905
06:00:20,000 --> 06:00:23,840
Uh, and I can't just place it here because I need to freaking fill in all this

4906
06:00:24,640 --> 06:00:29,920
Oh, I know it's getting full. You didn't need to tell me wait. Did I not send you to this?

4907
06:00:32,240 --> 06:00:34,240
What was the instructions?

4908
06:00:34,640 --> 06:00:36,640
Okay, just anyone. Okay, that's fine

4909
06:00:37,360 --> 06:00:39,360
We'll send that now so everyone can get their sweet

4910
06:00:40,320 --> 06:00:43,520
Your endurance will come back. You just need to get your edge back. Yeah

4911
06:00:44,880 --> 06:00:47,360
I'm sure I'll feel better after the audio. I'm sure

4912
06:00:49,200 --> 06:00:50,880
I just need to do the audio first

4913
06:00:50,880 --> 06:00:55,920
I'm going to what I'll do is after the stream I'll take a nap because I got a lot of stuff done yesterday

4914
06:00:55,920 --> 06:00:59,120
Like that's why when I popped up on stream, I was like, did you see did you see

4915
06:00:59,520 --> 06:01:07,040
Emi Azura's stories, audios all got uploaded like their patrons got updated. Ha ha ha. Did you see because that was me?

4916
06:01:07,840 --> 06:01:12,800
I didn't edit them, but I did like the little cringy descriptions of them. I'm so bad at doing them

4917
06:01:13,040 --> 06:01:19,040
I'm so bad at doing tags as well, but I'm learning. Okay. I'm learning right. Let's start filling out this garden

4918
06:01:19,120 --> 06:01:21,120
I've had enough of water

4919
06:01:21,120 --> 06:01:25,520
Fricking animals coming in dictating how much percentage of the garden has to be water

4920
06:01:26,320 --> 06:01:29,280
Like you're gonna need to give it a break this entire garden is war

4921
06:01:30,000 --> 06:01:32,240
It's not a good garden for

4922
06:01:32,960 --> 06:01:33,680
land

4923
06:01:33,680 --> 06:01:35,280
anything you

4924
06:01:35,280 --> 06:01:37,280
How is my

4925
06:01:37,840 --> 06:01:45,440
Yes, I mean I've kind of said so many things had to be put on hold while my dad was here and it's caused such like

4926
06:01:46,720 --> 06:01:49,920
There was a few issues in the background anyway with like timing and stuff

4927
06:01:50,560 --> 06:01:52,160
um

4928
06:01:52,160 --> 06:01:54,160
But it's all dealt with

4929
06:01:56,080 --> 06:01:59,120
So things are gonna even up and I can go back to doing my ASMRs

4930
06:01:59,200 --> 06:02:03,280
And I can go back to doing a few things in the background for the girls like if they want to do like

4931
06:02:04,160 --> 06:02:04,880
Thank you

4932
06:02:04,880 --> 06:02:10,480
Um, if they want to like do ASMR stuff and that like I've gotten ASMR youtube roughly to edit from mercies

4933
06:02:10,640 --> 06:02:12,640
Probably the next thing I have to do

4934
06:02:13,200 --> 06:02:18,480
I can just sell these flutter scotches because I have all flutter scotches now. Thank you. Um

4935
06:02:19,760 --> 06:02:21,760

4938
06:02:31,920 --> 06:02:36,640
Um, I'm gonna put down two sweeties. I'm gonna have the pig have one and one of the swans have the other

4939
06:02:39,360 --> 06:02:41,600

Wait, that didn't work

4946
06:03:08,240 --> 06:03:11,120
No, you guys have made it before

4947
06:03:12,880 --> 06:03:15,120

4949
06:03:26,960 --> 06:03:31,680
Huh, okay, that is what we're supposed to hunt the pig it didn't work for I don't know why

I have terrible news for the female audience. I'm sorry

4952
06:03:45,120 --> 06:03:51,120
Maybe another streamer. I don't think that streamers me but not in a mean way not in a nasty way just doesn't I like

4953
06:03:52,640 --> 06:03:54,640
I don't

4954
06:03:55,520 --> 06:04:02,000
I don't got guys they pay my bills and I want to be nice in the content focus

4955
06:04:02,560 --> 06:04:06,320
Because the fast art randomly go in like female for female content

4956
06:04:07,040 --> 06:04:10,160
My entire established fan base is gonna be like, ah

4957
06:04:10,880 --> 06:04:12,160
well

4958
06:04:12,160 --> 06:04:14,480
That's not for me. I'm no longer supporting

4959
06:04:14,880 --> 06:04:19,760
So I don't really get like the demand of like hey change up everything you do right now for me

4960
06:04:26,240 --> 06:04:30,960
Female reeflings and shamblings the three female reeflings are absolutely perishing

4961
06:04:31,440 --> 06:04:35,040
Actually, I think if there is any reeflings that are female

4962
06:04:35,120 --> 06:04:39,840
They genuinely wholeheartedly get it and don't like say anything. They're like, yeah get it

4963
06:04:40,560 --> 06:04:43,280
Like there's nothing else to like yeah, yeah, I get it

4964
06:04:44,480 --> 06:04:46,080
right

4965
06:04:46,080 --> 06:04:48,480
I may have forgotten to make the pigs hump

4966
06:04:50,160 --> 06:04:53,200
I didn't because I remember I got them to do all their thing

4967
06:04:56,960 --> 06:04:58,640
I'm wondering

4968
06:04:58,640 --> 06:05:02,640
Right one we're selling this fucking house before yous are all going in it

4969
06:05:04,880 --> 06:05:06,880
Okay, so then who

4970
06:05:07,680 --> 06:05:09,680
You right, okay

4971
06:05:10,720 --> 06:05:12,720
Oh

4972
06:05:15,680 --> 06:05:19,520
Where is she there she is right land

4973
06:05:20,960 --> 06:05:22,960
No, is this

4974
06:05:25,920 --> 06:05:30,720
That that's right cheat in front of your wife and child I worked

4975
06:05:32,960 --> 06:05:34,960
When pigs fly

4976
06:05:37,760 --> 06:05:39,760
It's why gatekeeping can be unfulfilled

4977
06:05:40,400 --> 06:05:43,360
Hey when something turns up somewhere and demands change to sit them

4978
06:05:44,320 --> 06:05:48,400
And then they get the change and everyone's literally like I have to be like

4979
06:05:49,840 --> 06:05:55,520
Oh, sorry the piggies are really wobbly like he's twerking his way in between these

4980
06:05:58,400 --> 06:06:02,080
If someone does something and they tell you to change it why not look for something else

4981
06:06:03,040 --> 06:06:08,000
Yeah, I'm on that fence have been like I can't be I can't be everyone's favorite streamer

4982
06:06:08,000 --> 06:06:12,400
It's not possible and I can't make content that everyone's gonna enjoy that's not possible

4983
06:06:12,400 --> 06:06:14,560
So I'm not gonna like hold myself up to that

4984
06:06:15,680 --> 06:06:18,320
What's it say so it's like what a palace

4985
06:06:19,680 --> 06:06:23,600
I mean just looks like oh that looks so cozy with the heavy feelings. I just want that for ourselves

4986
06:06:24,480 --> 06:06:29,120
Imagine being at a fireplace every night and it's a bit cold and we put the fire on and

4987
06:06:29,760 --> 06:06:35,520
Maybe we're reading books like our own books together like we're sharing the space together that kind of thing

4988
06:06:36,320 --> 06:06:38,320
All right, I'm gonna sell you

4989
06:06:38,320 --> 06:06:40,320
I'm gonna sell you when you pop out you're freaking

4990
06:06:41,600 --> 06:06:45,280
Rest well those who sleep. Thank you for hanging swan and

4991
06:06:47,360 --> 06:06:49,760
It's like going to mcdonald's and demand the cashier for

4992
06:06:50,880 --> 06:06:52,880
plate the pasta

4993
06:06:55,600 --> 06:06:58,720
If you try it, please everybody you please nobody exactly

4994
06:07:00,080 --> 06:07:02,080
Okay, so

4995
06:07:04,800 --> 06:07:11,040
Pop you away make we're at what 45,000 next time it rains

4996
06:07:11,440 --> 06:07:16,720
I think I'll do the orchid approach. I think we need a hundred key on hand

4997
06:07:17,840 --> 06:07:25,280
In order to order and sorry. Holy crap. That is uh one little voice line and a half right now

4998
06:07:26,240 --> 06:07:28,240
I think

4999
06:07:31,520 --> 06:07:33,520
Um

5000
06:07:35,920 --> 06:07:40,720
What do I think I don't think about much often I've not got much of a brain but that's okay. Um

5001
06:07:43,360 --> 06:07:45,760
Oh my god, what am I trying to say? I can't even get word out right now

5002
06:07:48,160 --> 06:07:51,120
You don't have you don't need everyone to enjoy every

5003
06:07:52,000 --> 06:07:54,560
To enjoy you for you to be the president

5004
06:07:56,000 --> 06:07:57,520
Oh

5005
06:07:57,520 --> 06:07:59,520
You can still rule them all

5006
06:08:01,040 --> 06:08:03,040
I am your leader

5007
06:08:03,520 --> 06:08:05,520
Yes, I am your leader

5008
06:08:06,080 --> 06:08:07,200
I'm not

5009
06:08:07,200 --> 06:08:11,600
Please do not actually do anything. I see I probably give the worst advice on all the land

5010
06:08:14,480 --> 06:08:16,880
Hydration checks little reeflings, okay

5011
06:08:17,440 --> 06:08:19,440
I

5012
06:08:22,640 --> 06:08:27,840
Vote for strong eight. Oh, I'd be assassinated long before I could put any change in place

5013
06:08:28,400 --> 06:08:31,840
They would absolutely the I would straight up be gone

5014
06:08:32,880 --> 06:08:40,560
They would not have me big oil would not have me because like my first line of duty would be like band single use plastic

5015
06:08:40,640 --> 06:08:43,440
It's now on the manufacturers to pay an

5016
06:08:43,440 --> 06:08:46,160
Extortionate fee if they continue

5017
06:08:46,720 --> 06:08:51,360
Uh producing what like single use plastic non recyclable plastic

5018
06:08:52,000 --> 06:08:53,840
um

5019
06:08:53,840 --> 06:08:56,960
I would be gone down and out. I'd be a goner

5020
06:08:58,080 --> 06:09:02,800
Like before I could even start changing anything. Oh, I'd be gone

5021
06:09:03,600 --> 06:09:05,600
They wouldn't have it

5022
06:09:05,600 --> 06:09:06,880
It would be

5023
06:09:06,880 --> 06:09:10,080
It would be oh strongy couldn't handle the pressure being president

5024
06:09:10,160 --> 06:09:14,640
So she popped her clogs and I'd be sitting there like in my grave like you all believe that

5025
06:09:16,720 --> 06:09:18,160
Disposable hate

5026
06:09:18,160 --> 06:09:22,960
Literally do not put the problem on the consumer, which is what they've been doing for ages now

5027
06:09:23,040 --> 06:09:30,080
Oh my god, the egg hasn't even hatched and he is going for the hunt. I'm watching you you poisoned my reefling twice

5028
06:09:30,160 --> 06:09:34,320
I'm not taking my eyes off of you until you cough up and I break all this week

5029
06:09:35,200 --> 06:09:38,160
I'm not taking my eyes off of you

5030
06:09:40,480 --> 06:09:42,480
Yeah, mm-hmm. Mm-hmm

5031
06:09:43,040 --> 06:09:46,000
Right don't inspect your handy work. Right. That's what you get

5032
06:09:47,280 --> 06:09:52,480
I almost hit you. You almost made me hit you. I'm that's right. I'm victim blaming for feet. I'm all no

5033
06:09:52,560 --> 06:09:54,720
You don't want that. It's not good for your tummy, darling

5034
06:09:55,200 --> 06:09:58,720
Right parry bow if I remember correctly

5035
06:10:00,240 --> 06:10:08,320
If I pimp this parry bow out with clothes, we're actually gonna get another achievement. We just have a pinata worth 10 000 points

5036
06:10:09,120 --> 06:10:15,680
So basically we just need to give it really expensive quotes. I think that hat was 900 back there

5037
06:10:17,280 --> 06:10:21,120
It doesn't matter what you put on it as long as it's expensive doesn't have to look good

5038
06:10:21,200 --> 06:10:24,160
Okay, that pirate hat looks like the most expensive one

5039
06:10:25,040 --> 06:10:27,040
Okay

5040
06:10:27,440 --> 06:10:33,280
Yep, perfect. Love it eyes. Let's put most expensive legs on six hundred

5041
06:10:33,920 --> 06:10:36,240
Eyes six hundred right a wee eye patch. Why not?

5042
06:10:36,480 --> 06:10:41,360
Mm-hmm. Why is the pirate stuff will hydrate later? Why not? No

5043
06:10:43,120 --> 06:10:50,800
Uh most expensive six hundred that's cool. We are pimping the crap out of the bird. He's gonna be so many many

5044
06:10:51,440 --> 06:10:53,440
comedic nose. Why not? Sure

5045
06:10:54,080 --> 06:10:55,840
Yeah, that

5046
06:10:55,840 --> 06:11:00,560
Yeah, that looks great. It looks awful. I know it looks awful. We just need time to be expensive. Okay

5047
06:11:01,520 --> 06:11:09,280
And we're Gucci maxing right now. I don't understand like clothing brands like I'm one of those people that like I don't get it

5048
06:11:09,360 --> 06:11:11,360
I'm sorry. I'm too dumb to understand

5049
06:11:12,800 --> 06:11:17,600
So we're just Gucci maxing right now. Okay. Oh, he saw him

5050
06:11:19,360 --> 06:11:22,000
I put a rose on your mouse

5051
06:11:22,960 --> 06:11:24,960
I

5052
06:11:27,760 --> 06:11:29,760
Remember

5053
06:11:29,920 --> 06:11:32,960
Are you in the garden? Oh, there we go. I'm putting you out of value

5054
06:11:34,080 --> 06:11:36,080
What is his value after all that?

5055
06:11:37,440 --> 06:11:40,080
Total value eight thousand accessories

5056
06:11:40,800 --> 06:11:47,920
Four thousand. Okay, there we go. Where are you? I put a rose at your mouth because you were so irresistible

5057
06:11:48,000 --> 06:11:50,000
I

5058
06:11:50,560 --> 06:11:54,400
Just remembered seeing that I so remember I put a rose on your mouth

5059
06:11:56,240 --> 06:11:58,000
Hold on

5060
06:11:58,000 --> 06:12:00,000
Because you're so romantic

5061
06:12:01,040 --> 06:12:07,760
Oh, you're complete. I saw something was missing. No, come here. I want to see you

5062
06:12:08,240 --> 06:12:12,320
Oh, don't are you so embarrassed that you want to scurry home? Oh, baby

5063
06:12:13,280 --> 06:12:17,840
You're embarrassed, but oh don't be embarrassed to show me a fiction. It's so cute

5064
06:12:18,640 --> 06:12:20,640
Oh

5065
06:12:22,400 --> 06:12:25,840
There's my chance. Okay. I'll let you sleep. Okay

5066
06:12:26,640 --> 06:12:32,240
Goodbye little you go. Oh, you're awake again. Oh, you're just you're just checking yourself out

5067
06:12:32,960 --> 06:12:35,200
Check you out though. You got a color

5068
06:12:35,200 --> 06:12:40,640
You got a little accolade because you much bit your boy and then you've got your little rose because you're so romantic

5069
06:12:41,280 --> 06:12:45,120
Oh, oh my god, you're going up on your hand legs

5070
06:12:46,880 --> 06:12:50,000
Oh my god, I love it. I love you

5071
06:12:52,080 --> 06:12:58,880
Wait, why is the pig crying? What's wrong? I'm just gonna sell you if you're greeting your eyes. I said what I said

5072
06:13:01,120 --> 06:13:04,560
I don't know why it this one was upset. I think maybe because the

5073
06:13:05,440 --> 06:13:07,440
was getting trampled

5074
06:13:07,600 --> 06:13:12,640
Spread this is why I don't like oh, what would you like anything you want?

5075
06:13:13,520 --> 06:13:15,520
for

5076
06:13:15,520 --> 06:13:17,520
buzzing Joe's

5077
06:13:18,560 --> 06:13:23,680
Nobody hunts in the morning, but I have to be here to take orders for buzzing Joe's

5078
06:13:25,600 --> 06:13:27,600
At four grand each

5079
06:13:28,240 --> 06:13:30,720
Oh, she better be on them pronto

5080
06:13:31,680 --> 06:13:33,520
I've got one. Oh

5081
06:13:33,520 --> 06:13:36,480
Oh going to cheap. Oh, there is when pigs fly

5082
06:13:37,680 --> 06:13:39,440
Oh, he's a bit wonky

5083
06:13:39,440 --> 06:13:41,440
That's okay as long as you're enjoying life

5084
06:13:42,720 --> 06:13:44,720
Well, you do we bet wonky

5085
06:13:45,680 --> 06:13:47,680
Are you okay?

5086
06:13:49,680 --> 06:13:54,480
Is it okay sorry, I'm gonna have to sell your house. It's not your fault. It's because I need you to be

5087
06:13:55,840 --> 06:13:57,600
um

5088
06:13:57,600 --> 06:14:02,640
I see I think he's an abomination. I think he's a bit mashed together

5089
06:14:02,880 --> 06:14:04,880
Are you okay?

5090
06:14:05,600 --> 06:14:09,760
Oh as we like doesn't work that well. Well as long as you're okay. Are you happy though?

5091
06:14:11,120 --> 06:14:13,120
Will I give you a wee sweetie?

5092
06:14:15,440 --> 06:14:17,920
It's no surprise to that gardener of your staff

5093
06:14:21,680 --> 06:14:24,720
Here let's put some joy sweets then everyone can have a wee bit of joy

5094
06:14:26,400 --> 06:14:31,440
Me when I upload a new audio to patreon. Haha. Sorry. That was a good one

5095
06:14:33,280 --> 06:14:41,040
Oh, I'd put one in the water. Here you go. Here you go. Thank you. Uh, where did he go? Hey, buddy. Do you want one of these?

5096
06:14:44,240 --> 06:14:46,240
Have a wee nibble

5097
06:14:47,440 --> 06:14:49,440
You like it

5098
06:14:49,680 --> 06:14:53,600
Oh, you like it. Oh, you're growing up. Okay, right

5099
06:14:54,320 --> 06:14:56,640
Well, we'll see what a fill size one of you looks like then

5100
06:14:57,840 --> 06:15:00,480
Can I hatch your cocoon? No, it's too early

5101
06:15:00,480 --> 06:15:03,760
Did that mallow wolf go home already?

5102
06:15:05,040 --> 06:15:07,040
Dracked. We're too late, but that's okay

5103
06:15:09,680 --> 06:15:10,880
Um

5104
06:15:10,880 --> 06:15:16,000
Enter suffering. Oh, is he suffering? I don't know. He seemed happy. I gave him a little treat

5105
06:15:16,640 --> 06:15:18,640
He's quite happy, quite chuffed himself

5106
06:15:19,200 --> 06:15:21,200
um

5107
06:15:22,160 --> 06:15:28,000
Right now that we've done that we can get a mallow wolf. So then we're just going straight back to petunia a farm

5108
06:15:28,000 --> 06:15:33,760
Hey pal anything exciting happening out there? No. Yeah

5109
06:15:36,880 --> 06:15:38,560
Okay

5110
06:15:38,560 --> 06:15:44,320
So these bams are all gonna fly everywhere when I buy them just to warn you now

5111
06:15:45,120 --> 06:15:47,440
It's gonna be so hard to try and sell them

5112
06:15:48,800 --> 06:15:56,000
Because they instantly fly away. Okay. We have the master moments. Don't fly one two three four

5113
06:15:56,960 --> 06:15:58,400
Five

5114
06:15:58,400 --> 06:16:03,680
One two three four five. Oh, we did it. Okay. Now. There's only two in the garden that we need to deal with

5115
06:16:04,560 --> 06:16:06,560
Okay, I don't know where the other one went by the way

5116
06:16:07,680 --> 06:16:09,680
Okay

5117
06:16:09,680 --> 06:16:11,680
But we're doing it. We're doing it right pigeon now

5118
06:16:14,880 --> 06:16:19,120
Pigeon home. Oh, it's a pudgeon as in fudge. Oh, that's a good one

5119
06:16:20,800 --> 06:16:22,800
Okay

5120
06:16:22,960 --> 06:16:29,440
Oh, what do you mean? My garden is full. I'm so there's three trees one decoration. I mean

5121
06:16:30,240 --> 06:16:32,800
Bruh, what do you mean? There's like four flowers

5122
06:16:33,440 --> 06:16:36,080
Have the audacity to have some flowers

5123
06:16:37,360 --> 06:16:41,120
I don't know if the oak tree is like taking up insane room or something

5124
06:16:41,680 --> 06:16:47,360
I don't know. I'm gonna reduce the flowers again further. So this game can't be like it's the flowers. It's the flowers

5125
06:16:47,520 --> 06:16:48,960
I'm having enough

5126
06:16:48,960 --> 06:16:50,960
We have like native flowers honestly

5127
06:16:52,800 --> 06:17:00,320
If it's because them or pop. Oh, you just stood on that. Um, if it's because they're like popping the flowers, that's different, but

5128
06:17:01,520 --> 06:17:06,240
This is the only thing about this game. I must complain about I must I must I must I can't hold it in anymore

5129
06:17:07,280 --> 06:17:11,760
Is that the game's so dramatic like your garden's full your garden's filled like it's not

5130
06:17:13,520 --> 06:17:18,960
There's nothing in it other than a few objects. That's why I think houses must like anything

5131
06:17:19,840 --> 06:17:23,520
It's trunnies garden is full that's a sense. So

5132
06:17:24,640 --> 06:17:26,640
This is after hearing an audio

5133
06:17:26,640 --> 06:17:32,800
Lauer I'm just blaming the flowers. What do you think right hunter caught the piñata, right? We're just gonna go all out on buzzing

5134
06:17:33,840 --> 06:17:35,360
buzzing

5135
06:17:35,360 --> 06:17:38,880
Buzz engine what food item is plus energy?

5136
06:17:40,400 --> 06:17:45,120
I don't know but uh, they're all perishing whatever they are. Is it down? Yes

5137
06:17:46,080 --> 06:17:48,080
Four thousand a pop

5138
06:17:49,520 --> 06:17:57,440
Maybe once we get the eagle will do the plant technique and get 100k and then we can get that achievement as well for 100k coins

5139
06:18:06,640 --> 06:18:11,920
You know wouldn't water actually kill the piñata? I think so in a technicality, but

5140
06:18:12,320 --> 06:18:17,360
How much are you worth it says you're only worth 8k

5141
06:18:20,480 --> 06:18:22,480
Hmm

5142
06:18:22,720 --> 06:18:24,720
What is bouncing

5143
06:18:25,680 --> 06:18:31,520
That is right. Okay. That eagle's going for the buzzing. Look, I'm trying to play coy. No, I'm not going for you

5144
06:18:32,880 --> 06:18:36,960
Oh, well, you're right at his house now. He's gonna. I think he's gonna spot you something tells me he's gonna spot you

5145
06:18:37,600 --> 06:18:39,600
Oh, there's a lion

5146
06:18:40,160 --> 06:18:46,000
Hi lion you want to come into my garden? What's that you do?

5147
06:18:50,560 --> 06:18:53,360
Right, what do you want to meet you want a camera?

5148
06:18:54,640 --> 06:18:57,360
Are they paparazzi? I think they're paparazzi

5149
06:18:58,560 --> 06:19:00,560
Yeah, that's a funky looking bird

5150
06:19:01,360 --> 06:19:03,360
Your garden is filled you do your challenge

5151
06:19:04,000 --> 06:19:06,000
Right, we need a camera around his neck

5152
06:19:06,880 --> 06:19:12,000
No, yes, okay, it's around his neck. Yeah

5153
06:19:13,280 --> 06:19:16,400
Okay, what else do you want to eat? Is it

5154
06:19:17,440 --> 06:19:21,840
Two ears of corn. Okay, we're just gonna grow them. I refuse to give in to cost a lot

5155
06:19:22,720 --> 06:19:25,360
More like good evening. I have enough time to go see

5156
06:19:28,800 --> 06:19:31,840
I don't know the other thing he needs those but we're getting there we're getting there

5157
06:19:32,720 --> 06:19:38,320
And then that'll be the pigeon's done and then we'll go for the next achievement, which is do

5158
06:19:40,080 --> 06:19:42,080
100

5159
06:19:44,160 --> 06:19:47,520
Is that shite? Oh my god, it's bird shite coming out of the

5160
06:19:48,240 --> 06:19:50,000
their house

5161
06:19:50,000 --> 06:19:52,320
We'll do that hundred coins achievement next

5162
06:19:54,720 --> 06:20:01,520
Oh, they're pooping on the bad guys statue. Okay, that's actually pretty good a government drone

5163
06:20:02,560 --> 06:20:05,040
Is that how far back those jokes started?

5164
06:20:07,600 --> 06:20:09,600
That the birds are spying on us

5165
06:20:11,840 --> 06:20:13,840
Hmm

5166
06:20:13,840 --> 06:20:15,840
Well, he's eaten one

5167
06:20:17,840 --> 06:20:22,960
So i'm actually going to open up his encyclopedia to make sure I have what he needs to show up again

5168
06:20:23,920 --> 06:20:29,440
Level 33 gardener bird have five different species in the garden, which I definitely do

5169
06:20:30,400 --> 06:20:31,440
The

5170
06:20:31,440 --> 06:20:37,040
Resident is eat four and have 15 different species in the garden. Okay, because we have the flutter scotch

5171
06:20:37,520 --> 06:20:39,520
We reach that with ease

5172
06:20:40,560 --> 06:20:43,920
Um because flutter scotch count is four a seven

5173
06:20:44,400 --> 06:20:48,800
I think there's seven colors so that easily counts. I just need more buzzing just

5174
06:20:50,000 --> 06:20:53,840
Are we sure that statue isn't a fertility totem?

5175
06:20:53,840 --> 06:20:55,840
Oh

5176
06:20:56,400 --> 06:20:58,400
It's bird poo poo

5177
06:20:59,440 --> 06:21:01,440
Oh

5178
06:21:02,400 --> 06:21:08,560
The pigs hiding in the tree. Well if that werewolf comes into the garden floor, it's getting tapped down to the ground

5179
06:21:10,000 --> 06:21:14,640
Right you want corn that's fine. I need to find your buddy though. I can't find him

5180
06:21:16,080 --> 06:21:19,120
Is he sleeping here? No, he's not actually

5181
06:21:20,160 --> 06:21:22,640
I build a house for you guys and you don't even use it

5182
06:21:24,720 --> 06:21:26,720
That's definitely him

5183
06:21:31,200 --> 06:21:38,400
Oh wait, are they not eating the candy until I tell them to they're not hey buddy snappy you can eat that

5184
06:21:40,560 --> 06:21:42,560
Everyone can eat the wee thing

5185
06:21:44,400 --> 06:21:46,400
You guys can eat the wee things, okay

5186
06:21:47,840 --> 06:21:51,520
I bought them as a gift for them. I don't think they'd be too scared

5187
06:21:52,080 --> 06:22:03,520
I'll get you in trouble. I'll make a little like an iphone

5188
06:22:05,920 --> 06:22:10,720
I won't eat in trouble. You can't be in trouble for me actually so difficult

5189
06:22:13,280 --> 06:22:15,280
Keep going

5190
06:22:16,080 --> 06:22:19,760
Uh, did I plant something that needs watering or was that like from easy to go?

5191
06:22:21,520 --> 06:22:23,520
I'm thankful

5192
06:22:23,760 --> 06:22:27,280
Right you go eat some corn

5193
06:22:33,360 --> 06:22:35,360
Oh, he's so cute

5194
06:22:35,360 --> 06:22:41,040
They're all so adorable refling. Did you get a candy refling you silly gopher that's for you

5195
06:22:41,760 --> 06:22:43,760
Oh, I found the other pigeon

5196
06:22:44,880 --> 06:22:46,880
I'm gonna put some coals on

5197
06:22:46,960 --> 06:22:48,960
Oh

5198
06:22:49,200 --> 06:22:55,360
Margin people's dinning in the marshmallow boy. What's the marshmallow banquet? That'd be that right?

5199
06:22:58,800 --> 06:23:03,200
Oh, no, I'm sorry. It wasn't that accessory. Yeah, that's why I'm getting distracted

5200
06:23:03,840 --> 06:23:06,000
Actually, I'm getting a bit tired. I'm like, oh my god one coin

5201
06:23:06,560 --> 06:23:11,360
But no one else is coming on and I'm like, oh no, I don't win. I don't want anyone to feel bad

5202
06:23:12,960 --> 06:23:14,960
Hey, buddy, can you come eat this corn?

5203
06:23:15,360 --> 06:23:19,360
Your your pudgeon buddy's one in there to

5204
06:23:21,120 --> 06:23:25,360
Eat the tasty poison candy the other reflings took my candy. No

5205
06:23:27,280 --> 06:23:32,400
You guys don't steal from each other, you know how to share, right? Or do I need to teach you how to share?

5206
06:23:34,240 --> 06:23:37,840
Don't think I won't do it right stop flying. I need to know what your other requirement is

5207
06:23:38,160 --> 06:23:48,320
You do not have to do a 720 around the item that I'm asking you to eat. Thank you

5208
06:23:50,560 --> 06:23:54,240
Okay, what do you need a snap dragon seed and something else

5209
06:23:56,400 --> 06:24:01,920
Wow, okay, it's raining. I am going to do the orchard orchard

5210
06:24:02,960 --> 06:24:04,720
method, okay

5211
06:24:04,720 --> 06:24:09,760
Let's take advantage of the rain or is the rain gonna take advantage of us we'll find out

5212
06:24:15,680 --> 06:24:21,200
We just I need to tell them to eat those candies though because they're taking up space in the garden

5213
06:24:22,720 --> 06:24:25,680
I mean that might be enough for now. I know honestly

5214
06:24:27,840 --> 06:24:30,480
I'm waiting for her to go. Whoa your garden is way too big

5215
06:24:35,280 --> 06:24:37,280
That one

5216
06:24:37,600 --> 06:24:40,080
Okay, this is enough profit farming

5217
06:24:41,440 --> 06:24:43,600
More than enough right you plant

5218
06:24:44,480 --> 06:24:46,480
you plant

5219
06:24:46,800 --> 06:24:53,280
Now to get the fertilizer out. We're gonna sell this entire batch and it may get us to 10k. I'm not

5220
06:24:54,240 --> 06:24:55,760
Maybe not

5221
06:24:55,760 --> 06:24:58,560
But because it's raining we don't have to worry about any

5222
06:24:59,280 --> 06:25:00,320
aim

5223
06:25:00,320 --> 06:25:02,320
like water in them

5224
06:25:02,560 --> 06:25:06,800
But we do have to now do this method of fertilizing every dang thing

5225
06:25:09,200 --> 06:25:10,880
Awesome

5226
06:25:10,880 --> 06:25:17,360
Mommy likes it wet. No, I have the rain in order to do this trick or else you're gonna run out of time like trying to water all the plants

5227
06:25:17,920 --> 06:25:18,560
and

5228
06:25:18,560 --> 06:25:21,120
fertilize them all for the max income when you sell them

5229
06:25:23,840 --> 06:25:25,840
The sprinkler is gonna come in anyway

5230
06:25:27,440 --> 06:25:30,800
First you get us in trouble for eating something and now you will get

5231
06:25:31,760 --> 06:25:35,920
And now you give get us into trouble for not eating this is

5232
06:25:36,640 --> 06:25:38,160
what

5233
06:25:38,160 --> 06:25:42,080
I had a stroke trying to say your sentence. I think your sentence is fine and the problem is me

5234
06:25:42,080 --> 06:25:44,560
I'm gonna be honest. I have a feeling the problem's me

5235
06:25:46,000 --> 06:25:48,000
So please don't worry

5236
06:25:48,000 --> 06:25:50,000
I think that was all me

5237
06:25:50,480 --> 06:25:57,280
Now I need that eagle to come back. Oh, are we finally gonna get a freaking mark? Uh, um the wolf

5238
06:25:57,360 --> 06:25:59,360
I think we're finally gonna get the wolf

5239
06:26:00,320 --> 06:26:02,320
No, no, no

5240
06:26:03,760 --> 06:26:08,160
Cal Cal Kerr, thank you so much for becoming a member. What did you just do?

5241
06:26:09,200 --> 06:26:12,400
Go go and annoy the freaking

5242
06:26:13,040 --> 06:26:14,240
pig thing

5243
06:26:14,240 --> 06:26:16,000
and beat it up

5244
06:26:16,000 --> 06:26:20,080
Hunter caught pinata. Not now. Not now. Everything's happening at the same time

5245
06:26:21,440 --> 06:26:23,440
This is the worst part

5246
06:26:24,320 --> 06:26:28,240
I think we're finally gonna get the wolf. Thank you again Cal Kerr for becoming a member

5247
06:26:29,680 --> 06:26:31,680
We need another buzzinger

5248
06:26:31,920 --> 06:26:36,400
And then I'm gonna go back to iver to fertilize everything. We're running out of time

5249
06:26:37,280 --> 06:26:39,280
I'm trying so hard

5250
06:26:40,800 --> 06:26:43,440
I'll need them to eat the freaking candy that's on the ground

5251
06:26:43,520 --> 06:26:48,480
I thought they were just gonna eat it because they normally do when a pinata comes back from a party

5252
06:26:49,200 --> 06:26:51,760
So I was like, oh, they're gonna do it right surely surely

5253
06:26:54,480 --> 06:26:55,920
Oh dear

5254
06:26:55,920 --> 06:26:57,920
Oh dear my running out of time already

5255
06:26:58,880 --> 06:27:05,120
Well, I thought we could get a hundred coins from this batch, but there's no way we're getting it. I refuse to believe

5256
06:27:08,320 --> 06:27:12,480
Where does it it's not gonna stop us though. We have got a ton of achievements

5257
06:27:12,720 --> 06:27:16,800
I wish I knew how to open up the dashboard to like show how many achievements we've got

5258
06:27:17,200 --> 06:27:21,440
But if we come back to viva pinata to like try and a hundred percent it

5259
06:27:22,160 --> 06:27:26,240
Um, I'll like do the thing that we're gonna do with skyrim when we go back

5260
06:27:26,320 --> 06:27:29,520
Is put all the achievements that we need to get on screen

5261
06:27:30,000 --> 06:27:33,440
Like you know how I did it with the last elton ring stream where we got the coconuts

5262
06:27:34,000 --> 06:27:38,960
Basically that and then we'll do it all together. So there's no parts where you miss out on it

5263
06:27:40,480 --> 06:27:42,480
Um

5264
06:27:42,560 --> 06:27:45,920
I yeah, I definitely think that's the best method for doing

5265
06:27:48,400 --> 06:27:50,400
Is the pixie gone yet

5266
06:27:51,600 --> 06:27:53,600
I don't want to see the

5267
06:27:54,240 --> 06:27:56,240
wolf thing

5268
06:27:56,640 --> 06:28:03,200
Oh, no, there's the pixie there. So the wolf is already at the garden. He's so temperamental honestly

5269
06:28:05,200 --> 06:28:07,200
Already having a go

5270
06:28:09,840 --> 06:28:13,120
Spits up seeds and then doesn't even go for the pixie

5271
06:28:15,360 --> 06:28:17,360
Have you beaten any pinatas yet? No

5272
06:28:18,080 --> 06:28:20,560
I think a walloped one at the wolf by

5273
06:28:21,520 --> 06:28:23,520
But like on purpose. No

5274
06:28:25,840 --> 06:28:27,840
Okay, we're getting there

5275
06:28:28,960 --> 06:28:32,320
We're almost done and then we can maximize our money

5276
06:28:33,920 --> 06:28:35,920
It's because you don't have room

5277
06:28:37,200 --> 06:28:38,960
Oh

5278
06:28:38,960 --> 06:28:40,960
I need a mod this game like right now

5279
06:28:41,920 --> 06:28:48,480
Um, I guess because so this came on xbox 360 and the xbox wasn't that powerful the 360

5280
06:28:48,480 --> 06:28:51,920
So I guess they obviously had to limit everything that was going on

5281
06:28:54,480 --> 06:28:56,480
Um

5282
06:28:57,520 --> 06:29:02,640
I'm trying my hardest everything's hating on me. Okay. There's two buzzings in the garden

5283
06:29:03,280 --> 06:29:09,200
We need one more and then that eagle will have done it the eagle has landed. I repeat the eagle has landed

5284
06:29:11,120 --> 06:29:14,240
Uh, is that everything? Oh, no, no, no

5285
06:29:15,520 --> 06:29:17,840
Don't turn into a flower yet. I'm not ready

5286
06:29:19,200 --> 06:29:24,080
I'm not ready. I'm not ready. I'm not ready. I'm not ready

5287
06:29:28,320 --> 06:29:30,320
I'm not ready

5288
06:29:31,760 --> 06:29:34,320
No, there is one more. How could I be so foolish?

5289
06:29:36,640 --> 06:29:38,640
It's an experience being up your favorite

5290
06:29:38,880 --> 06:29:41,360
Cartoon as a child on ya

5291
06:29:41,360 --> 06:29:46,160
I can't be mean to the pinatas will come to find refuge. I say that as if I'm not buying

5292
06:29:46,960 --> 06:29:49,360
Um, buzzings to be eaten by an eagle

5293
06:29:50,880 --> 06:29:52,880
Okay, I think that's everything

5294
06:29:53,600 --> 06:29:55,200
One more

5295
06:29:55,200 --> 06:29:57,680
And then we will maximize our funds and see what's up

5296
06:30:00,400 --> 06:30:07,440
I do need the pinatas to eat these freaking things though. No one's everyone's scared to eat you eat my darlin

5297
06:30:09,680 --> 06:30:11,680
I see the eagle

5298
06:30:12,480 --> 06:30:18,720
Can I'm going to tell her to go get another buzzings just in case like it reset or whatever

5299
06:30:20,320 --> 06:30:25,440
Honestly, I'm glad I never got people. I wouldn't be able to sacrifice any of the work

5300
06:30:26,320 --> 06:30:28,320
How is it like going straight for it?

5301
06:30:30,720 --> 06:30:32,720
Okay, we still have a

5302
06:30:34,160 --> 06:30:39,600
We're waiting for no, I don't want to pass fly. Okay one's going down. So I should technically be two

5303
06:30:40,560 --> 06:30:46,640
Like I'm making room. See I've I've disappeared this ear of corn. Oh, wait. No one of them needed to eat an

5304
06:30:49,680 --> 06:30:52,720
I need to sell the plants before I can grow anything else

5305
06:30:54,160 --> 06:30:56,160
A pinata is about to be eaten. Good

5306
06:30:57,120 --> 06:31:01,040
What we looking at two more. I only have one more in the garden

5307
06:31:02,160 --> 06:31:04,880
I need the the thing to

5308
06:31:05,920 --> 06:31:07,920
Save us

5309
06:31:08,720 --> 06:31:12,240
I like the harp music there garden value master

5310
06:31:13,680 --> 06:31:18,560
Oh, the plants are popping. Okay. That's why we got that achievement. All the plants just pop

5311
06:31:20,880 --> 06:31:26,880
Wait, why are you not? Wait, what? Only one flower popped on that. I don't get it

5312
06:31:29,440 --> 06:31:31,440
Oh

5313
06:31:31,440 --> 06:31:33,440
Filled with fun

5314
06:31:33,840 --> 06:31:35,840
30 achievements

5315
06:31:36,800 --> 06:31:41,840
That old achievement noise give me a hit dopamine going straight for the way

5316
06:31:43,920 --> 06:31:47,520
We did dairy achievements in one go. Oh, no, I got stinky

5317
06:31:50,000 --> 06:31:52,160
Yes, you can most certainly have a singular

5318
06:31:52,160 --> 06:31:56,320
Can you have a refling party time? It's time for your fourth socialization

5319
06:31:57,360 --> 06:32:02,480
Where are you? Oh, are you asleep? Okay. I'll send snappy out. They like snappy

5320
06:32:02,640 --> 06:32:04,640
Oh

5321
06:32:04,880 --> 06:32:09,440
Right, let's sell these flowers and pretend that we're going to make all the money in the world

5322
06:32:11,120 --> 06:32:14,400
Oh refling you were hiding. Did you not want to go to the party?

5323
06:32:14,960 --> 06:32:18,000
Or did you want to stay behind so you can eat all the sweets that drop?

5324
06:32:24,480 --> 06:32:26,480
Okay, money money money

5325
06:32:27,440 --> 06:32:29,440
Must be funny

5326
06:32:30,000 --> 06:32:32,000
In a rich refling world

5327
06:32:34,000 --> 06:32:36,000
Whoa

5328
06:32:36,240 --> 06:32:38,240
We're almost at like 50k

5329
06:32:39,280 --> 06:32:41,280
For that batch

5330
06:32:41,280 --> 06:32:44,160
I don't know why that one is being weird about it

5331
06:32:45,440 --> 06:32:47,440
You're full

5332
06:32:48,800 --> 06:32:52,080
I must have just I mean you can't ask them all to be perfect

5333
06:32:53,840 --> 06:32:58,160
Okay, there's no sweets that everyone can eat. I no need to wait

5334
06:33:00,160 --> 06:33:02,160
I think I'm out of

5335
06:33:02,560 --> 06:33:04,160
Bugs and juice

5336
06:33:04,160 --> 06:33:08,880
For the eagle to eat. Oh, no, there's one more if it wants to hunt him. That'll be three

5337
06:33:10,880 --> 06:33:13,040
And then I just need

5338
06:33:14,400 --> 06:33:17,920
One more which Grinchum is away getting

5339
06:33:18,720 --> 06:33:20,400
Oh, he's hunting

5340
06:33:20,400 --> 06:33:22,400
The eagle is hunting

5341
06:33:22,960 --> 06:33:29,360
Hydration check my voice is starting to feel a bit sore. What do you mean three three six hours of continuous

5342
06:33:29,440 --> 06:33:31,440
Talking is bad for your throat. How dear you?

5343
06:33:34,080 --> 06:33:36,560
And I recorded an ASMR before this room

5344
06:33:41,760 --> 06:33:46,800
If Grinchum can hurry up we may be able to grab this eagle before he goes

5345
06:33:49,120 --> 06:33:54,480
But it would have to happen now like right at the second

5346
06:33:54,880 --> 06:33:58,960
As long as you're still trucking along

5347
06:34:00,000 --> 06:34:02,000
Then that's a good

5348
06:34:02,000 --> 06:34:05,120
Please don't fly out of the garden mr. Eagle. Please

5349
06:34:06,400 --> 06:34:11,280
Please please. I'm begging AI. Please. I'm begging you AI. Please. Please

5350
06:34:12,160 --> 06:34:16,160
Please don't fly out of the garden. Please. We could have an eagle

5351
06:34:17,200 --> 06:34:18,480
Please

5352
06:34:18,480 --> 06:34:21,840
Please, please. Please. Please. Please. I'm on my

5353
06:34:22,800 --> 06:34:26,960
No way people need water after talking. I know it's shocking behavior

5354
06:34:29,200 --> 06:34:31,200
But we have made

5355
06:34:31,760 --> 06:34:38,320
63,000 coins. So if we do another batch we do we get the 100k coins achievement

5356
06:34:40,640 --> 06:34:44,800
I must I must pray did the eagle go home. I think it did

5357
06:34:46,880 --> 06:34:50,320
Oh, that's the one lucky timing, but it's okay. It's okay. It's okay

5358
06:34:52,640 --> 06:34:56,720
Um, are we warmling you're not happy buddy. Oh

5359
06:34:57,840 --> 06:35:03,840
Please eat the pixie wherever it is. It's a week. So you can eat it. That's how it works, right? Please

5360
06:35:04,880 --> 06:35:10,800
Just all lock on to the pixie. Don't throw up any more sweets. My refling is gonna hurt himself on it

5361
06:35:12,000 --> 06:35:14,000
He's doing it

5362
06:35:15,680 --> 06:35:18,080
Oh, did you hear the bees there?

5363
06:35:18,160 --> 06:35:20,160
Mmm

5364
06:35:20,400 --> 06:35:22,400
God he keeps messing up the hunt

5365
06:35:24,720 --> 06:35:30,240
Reflings no bad candy. I know it looks sweet, but it's not it makes your tummy hurt

5366
06:35:33,760 --> 06:35:39,360
He's making everyone miserable. Oh, is that why everyone's so unhappy in the garden

5367
06:35:41,040 --> 06:35:46,640
You're making everyone miserable. Eat the pig now. Where is where did it go?

5368
06:35:48,880 --> 06:35:50,880
Okay, that's a pigeon up in that tree

5369
06:35:51,760 --> 06:35:52,800
Refling

5370
06:35:52,800 --> 06:35:59,440
Oh, if you're tired darling, you can just go to your house. You don't have to sleep out like the other pinatas

5371
06:36:00,640 --> 06:36:02,640
Oh, he's gonna do it

5372
06:36:03,680 --> 06:36:10,160
Okay, you go to sleep darling. Okay, there you go. You get a nice comfy sleep in there. Oh, it's happening. We have a mallow wolf

5373
06:36:10,960 --> 06:36:12,960
Oh

5374
06:36:15,840 --> 06:36:19,360
I've completely forgotten what a mallow wolf looks like when being on her

5375
06:36:19,840 --> 06:36:25,600
She doesn't want us camping and sleeping. Let's you leave. Just come back in again. I guess you're like sleeping under the star. I'm gonna see

5376
06:36:27,600 --> 06:36:29,600
Okay

5377
06:36:30,080 --> 06:36:31,360
Oh

5378
06:36:31,360 --> 06:36:35,520
Right, is this the last sever pinata? It might be

5379
06:36:36,480 --> 06:36:41,600
I'm gonna sell the mallow. Give them high. Bless you. Thank you replay

5380
06:36:44,080 --> 06:36:46,080
Okay

5381
06:36:46,160 --> 06:36:51,920
I that might be the last sever pinata. I needed to get I don't recall another one

5382
06:36:52,720 --> 06:36:55,760
You've made space so you can continue to grow. I get it

5383
06:36:56,000 --> 06:37:00,080
Right. I'm looking at the journal because it keeps saying that I'm running out of space

5384
06:37:02,000 --> 06:37:05,360
What is it? It's not encyclopedia. Is it garden area?

5385
06:37:05,840 --> 06:37:07,840
No, it's not

5386
06:37:12,000 --> 06:37:16,400
This singular oak tree takes up eight slots

5387
06:37:17,680 --> 06:37:21,920
The tower of sour the dragonfly takes two

5388
06:37:25,520 --> 06:37:27,520
Bluebells chili

5389
06:37:27,600 --> 06:37:29,520
buttercup

5390
06:37:29,520 --> 06:37:35,600
Yeah, the gem tree and the oak. Oh, no, the oak tree is nine. I didn't see the one on below it

5391
06:37:36,160 --> 06:37:42,560
The oak tree takes up nine twos candy accessories take up space in my garden

5392
06:37:45,040 --> 06:37:48,320
I think that parry bow is getting sold. I'm not being funny

5393
06:37:49,120 --> 06:37:53,360
If his accessories are taking up space as well, that's outrageous

5394
06:37:53,360 --> 06:37:55,360
Oh

5395
06:37:55,600 --> 06:38:01,840
You getting some snacks we fling. Yeah, the yummy eat your tummy getting full of those the sweetie

5396
06:38:03,760 --> 06:38:05,760
Okay, that's good

5397
06:38:09,840 --> 06:38:14,720
We want to stay with mommy as much as possible. Mommy's one enough. Unfortunately

5398
06:38:16,000 --> 06:38:18,000
I'm a retired baby. Oh

5399
06:38:18,720 --> 06:38:21,840
What do you look like when you change up into a summer mallow?

5400
06:38:22,800 --> 06:38:24,800
Oh

5401
06:38:27,360 --> 06:38:29,360
Got to get a big tummy for mommy real

5402
06:38:30,400 --> 06:38:32,400
I've trained you well

5403
06:38:33,040 --> 06:38:35,040
Wow, what level are we?

5404
06:38:37,440 --> 06:38:40,880
Whoa, wait your eyes are red. What's wrong?

5405
06:38:44,240 --> 06:38:50,160
Are you fighting what's wrong? Or is that just how you look in general? Maybe that's just how you are

5406
06:38:52,560 --> 06:38:54,560
Uh

5407
06:38:55,120 --> 06:38:57,120
You look so unique

5408
06:39:00,000 --> 06:39:03,840
What unique boy you are I've never seen that before I don't really recall doing that

5409
06:39:03,840 --> 06:39:07,440
I really didn't do that much in childhood because I actually didn't know how to get a picture

5410
06:39:08,640 --> 06:39:14,640
Um, he's got them stoner eyes. Okay. I'm just going to order another buzzing just to

5411
06:39:15,520 --> 06:39:21,360
Help this ego in case it glitches out and it's like I haven't eaten four of them and I'll be like, well you have actually

5412
06:39:22,560 --> 06:39:24,560
You're just telling fibbers

5413
06:39:25,120 --> 06:39:32,720
If you're feeling tired getting nothing, okay, sit sit in my suite. I'll try and get the ego. How about make your deal? Once I get this dang ego

5414
06:39:34,880 --> 06:39:36,160
Then

5415
06:39:36,160 --> 06:39:40,480
We'll do it. I'm actually going to check how you get that lion because the lion

5416
06:39:41,360 --> 06:39:45,920
Like was unlocked and then just never came over to us

5417
06:39:47,200 --> 06:39:49,200
So those are level three

5418
06:39:50,080 --> 06:39:52,080
Level three

5419
06:39:54,400 --> 06:39:56,400
Level four

5420
06:39:56,720 --> 06:40:02,560
Quite a few fours. I need to get that squirrel actually. I need it for the next level of the serpent

5421
06:40:04,000 --> 06:40:08,480
Um, a donut hasn't even come into the garden. What do you want?

5422
06:40:15,840 --> 06:40:17,840
That's the noises it makes

5423
06:40:19,840 --> 06:40:22,640
When she keeps swarping

5424
06:40:23,920 --> 06:40:25,920
um

5425
06:40:25,920 --> 06:40:27,120
Right

5426
06:40:27,120 --> 06:40:31,920
Now we could go crazy and try and get all this book filled in

5427
06:40:32,400 --> 06:40:35,360
I am slightly tempted to do I wouldn't do it right now, but

5428
06:40:36,160 --> 06:40:39,920
I am tempted right rory. Oh, what's your story?

5429
06:40:42,320 --> 06:40:44,800
I have zero donuts in the garden

5430
06:40:45,200 --> 06:40:51,280
That'll be why your ass hasn't shown up in my garden. I'll go for you later because I actually don't have any donut

5431
06:40:51,920 --> 06:40:54,320
Oh, that noise does not spark joy

5432
06:40:55,600 --> 06:40:57,600
Okay, I

5433
06:40:57,680 --> 06:41:04,560
Think I'm going to sell parry ball because for some reason the game is registering his accessories is making taking up room

5434
06:41:05,120 --> 06:41:07,120
And it's getting a bit outrageous

5435
06:41:07,760 --> 06:41:10,000
Getting a bit outrageous. I have to admit. Um

5436
06:41:10,720 --> 06:41:14,720
I'm all riefling. I can't handle you. Yeah

5437
06:41:17,040 --> 06:41:22,640
Wait a minute. I thought the line appeared and left he went outside, but he never came inside

5438
06:41:23,200 --> 06:41:28,080
It's like for them to come inside the garden. They need like a set amount of things

5439
06:41:29,600 --> 06:41:31,600
Um

5440
06:41:31,920 --> 06:41:37,280
I don't know if that eagle's gonna spawn back in or not. I don't even know where it comes from. I assume up here maybe

5441
06:41:38,160 --> 06:41:40,480
Oh that nest up there is where he would spawn in

5442
06:41:41,520 --> 06:41:44,480
Maybe we should go for a donut then I guess then

5443
06:41:46,560 --> 06:41:49,120
What is the appearance requirements for them?

5444
06:41:50,400 --> 06:41:56,000
I don't think they're a high level pinata either. So hopefully it's not too awkward to try and get one

5445
06:41:57,120 --> 06:41:59,120
I just don't seem to ever get them

5446
06:42:00,000 --> 06:42:02,000
naturally

5447
06:42:02,480 --> 06:42:06,000
I knew get hasn't even showed up. I don't know what I'm doing so wrong with that

5448
06:42:07,280 --> 06:42:09,280
It's never visited me

5449
06:42:12,160 --> 06:42:18,080
Have watercress growing in the garden. I guess I only did like a few watercress and then give up

5450
06:42:19,760 --> 06:42:21,760
um

5451
06:42:22,720 --> 06:42:26,880
They even have a donut on look I do okay my apologies I do

5452
06:42:29,200 --> 06:42:34,960
So six percent long grass which I have have 10 blackberries in the garden and eat them

5453
06:42:35,840 --> 06:42:37,280
Okay

5454
06:42:37,280 --> 06:42:40,400
We're gonna plant a ton of blackberry bushes. How about that?

5455
06:42:42,080 --> 06:42:46,720
And then it'll show up and then we can work on getting the level 10

5456
06:42:48,240 --> 06:42:50,240
um

5457
06:42:50,960 --> 06:42:53,920
The level 10 what the level 10? Uh, pinata

5458
06:42:55,600 --> 06:43:03,040
Freezing because not thought behind her eye. Oh wait, I've not even bought the seed. I'm literally putting fertilizer in the hole

5459
06:43:03,040 --> 06:43:05,040
Oh

5460
06:43:05,280 --> 06:43:07,280
Hello

5461
06:43:07,280 --> 06:43:10,400
Okay, donut first. Okay, I'm not fuzzy

5462
06:43:13,040 --> 06:43:15,040
Okay one

5463
06:43:15,120 --> 06:43:16,560
two

5464
06:43:16,560 --> 06:43:18,560
three four

5465
06:43:19,120 --> 06:43:22,800
Oh the eagle's back. Oh the eagle might land

5466
06:43:24,960 --> 06:43:26,960
Okay, I've planted those

5467
06:43:27,760 --> 06:43:29,760
I'm now going to fertilize them

5468
06:43:30,320 --> 06:43:33,200
We're putting fertilizer in the hole

5469
06:43:36,080 --> 06:43:37,440
Okay, there's no other

5470
06:43:37,440 --> 06:43:43,040
So they need to get to a stage first before you can put fertilizer on like crop producing things

5471
06:43:43,600 --> 06:43:47,600
I need you to come in at this garden right now and eat all of the dying

5472
06:43:49,680 --> 06:43:51,680
Eat all of the dying things

5473
06:43:52,160 --> 06:43:54,160
Oh, I needed to make corn didn't I?

5474
06:43:56,000 --> 06:43:58,000
What was it corn and snap dragon seeds?

5475
06:43:58,640 --> 06:44:00,640
Remember

5476
06:44:00,960 --> 06:44:06,640
Mummy's brain backfiring. I'm getting tired. I have to admit. I'm actually starting to shut down a bit and I'm like, oh

5477
06:44:08,480 --> 06:44:11,680
There he is. He's just lurking in the distance

5478
06:44:12,560 --> 06:44:17,120
I don't have a donut for you. Please don't be disappointed in me. I'm sorry

5479
06:44:18,400 --> 06:44:20,400
I'm not ready yet

5480
06:44:22,240 --> 06:44:24,240
Is that wait did I hear the did it?

5481
06:44:25,040 --> 06:44:29,200
Oh, I did okay now I can do it. Okay

5482
06:44:31,680 --> 06:44:33,680
Okay

5483
06:44:33,760 --> 06:44:38,560
Uh it bloomed so can I do it again after the bloom animation?

5484
06:44:41,840 --> 06:44:44,000
No, okay a bit too early a bit too early

5485
06:44:45,680 --> 06:44:48,480
Something's making noises. Who are what? Oh the

5486
06:44:50,320 --> 06:44:52,320
Is the eagle mine?

5487
06:44:52,880 --> 06:44:54,880
Are you mine?

5488
06:44:56,240 --> 06:45:01,680
No, see that's what I thought would happen. He cleaned and she's out right now

5489
06:45:04,640 --> 06:45:07,040
Hmm, oh she's back. Okay

5490
06:45:08,720 --> 06:45:11,440
He's not eating he needs to eat

5491
06:45:14,000 --> 06:45:16,000
Better catch a second one

5492
06:45:16,720 --> 06:45:20,880
Buzzing number eight. Okay. Come on. I have not had eight of them

5493
06:45:22,800 --> 06:45:24,800
This game hates me

5494
06:45:26,320 --> 06:45:31,920
I've tried so hard and gone so far

5495
06:45:33,680 --> 06:45:35,680
In the end

5496
06:45:36,000 --> 06:45:38,000
Didn't even know

5497
06:45:41,520 --> 06:45:45,440
I'm trying my fertilizer's ready to go. You guys are too smooth

5498
06:45:46,320 --> 06:45:50,000
Okay, it's not ready yet. Is it ready? These ones ready because they're blooming over here

5499
06:45:51,520 --> 06:45:55,520
No, I'm just fucking drowning them in fertilizer hoping for the best

5500
06:45:56,320 --> 06:45:59,840
Right hen. It's okay to overwater them a little bit. I'm not being funny

5501
06:45:59,840 --> 06:46:03,200
Or you're gonna be bouncing back between these two plants over and over

5502
06:46:03,760 --> 06:46:05,920
It's okay to overwater. I promise you

5503
06:46:08,160 --> 06:46:11,040
A farm that works on ink instead of petrol

5504
06:46:12,320 --> 06:46:14,320
Then they need gas where we're going

5505
06:46:18,880 --> 06:46:21,920
No, you're gonna fight with my puzzle gum

5506
06:46:22,960 --> 06:46:29,040
I'm sorry. Can I tell you to go ways like nice by doing this? Why is there two of you go home?

5507
06:46:29,040 --> 06:46:33,840
Go home. I don't want you fighting with my little puzzle gum

5508
06:46:35,760 --> 06:46:40,400
Oh, Riefling's getting in on the drama. What drama are you watching? Huh?

5509
06:46:41,840 --> 06:46:47,360
What drama are you? Oh, are you just getting some water? Are you hydrating? Okay, I'll hydrate too. Riefling, you hydrate so I need to hydrate

5510
06:46:48,080 --> 06:46:50,080
Hmm

5511
06:46:58,320 --> 06:47:06,880
Bullying the ants honestly. Oh, no, don't ever sell my riefling don't I would actually be just short if I accidentally sold you or something

5512
06:47:08,880 --> 06:47:10,880
Oh my god, please be the last one

5513
06:47:13,840 --> 06:47:15,840
Oh, we're under the ground

5514
06:47:17,360 --> 06:47:19,360
Please be the last one

5515
06:47:24,400 --> 06:47:26,400
Did he glitch out and didn't eat him

5516
06:47:33,840 --> 06:47:35,920
Did he glitch out and didn't eat him?

5517
06:47:38,480 --> 06:47:41,680
Oh my god, right i'm putting the water away from the edge of the map

5518
06:47:42,240 --> 06:47:44,720
That just glitched out that eagle and he didn't

5519
06:47:45,360 --> 06:47:47,360
Get any

5520
06:47:47,760 --> 06:47:52,080
He didn't become mine because that freaking glitched out because he was at the edge of the map

5521
06:47:53,680 --> 06:47:59,680
Right, no more water at the edge of the map. I'm not having that. That's outrageous. Sorry. That's outrageous. I deserved that

5522
06:48:00,560 --> 06:48:03,040
That should have been a dub and it wasn't

5523
06:48:05,120 --> 06:48:07,120
That eagle was mine

5524
06:48:07,440 --> 06:48:09,440
Oh

5525
06:48:10,400 --> 06:48:12,400
How frustrating

5526
06:48:12,880 --> 06:48:16,800
I wonder how many didn't register. I hope that was the only one

5527
06:48:18,560 --> 06:48:21,680
Please don't be stuck there now. Oh god. You kind of look like it though

5528
06:48:23,120 --> 06:48:27,680
You're shaking your head. Please don't shake your head. It's never a good sign if they shake your head

5529
06:48:28,320 --> 06:48:30,320
Hmm

5530
06:48:31,920 --> 06:48:33,920
Right, I'm going to

5531
06:48:35,760 --> 06:48:39,280
Well, one of them just perished so yeah, he saw a ghost

5532
06:48:40,800 --> 06:48:44,400
He's in his nothing box at the moment. There's the guy's zone out

5533
06:48:48,560 --> 06:48:50,560
I don't know. I don't know

5534
06:48:51,360 --> 06:48:53,680
Please don't glitch out and be at the bottom of the map

5535
06:48:54,640 --> 06:48:58,160
I really hope he flies away if he glitches out. I'm gonna cry

5536
06:49:02,320 --> 06:49:04,320
Malo

5537
06:49:04,400 --> 06:49:07,440
What's malo? What with the fruit? What's the food item?

5538
06:49:08,320 --> 06:49:10,320
A werewolf a malo

5539
06:49:11,440 --> 06:49:13,280
Marsh malo wolf?

5540
06:49:13,280 --> 06:49:15,280
Yeah, that sounds correct. Marsh malo wolf

5541
06:49:17,040 --> 06:49:20,400
Uh, I'm actually gonna sell the water lily stuff

5542
06:49:21,120 --> 06:49:23,120
because

5543
06:49:23,120 --> 06:49:28,640
I just don't want to add them to the garden. I'm already struggling enough trying to get I think once I get the eagle

5544
06:49:29,200 --> 06:49:31,200
The oak tree doesn't matter

5545
06:49:32,400 --> 06:49:38,320
Actually, how much does you sell for two thousand and how much does the gem tree sell for one thousand?

5546
06:49:38,880 --> 06:49:40,880
But it takes up less room

5547
06:49:42,640 --> 06:49:48,480
Game will never let you leave is he still stuck there. Okay, he's gone home. So that's a good news

5548
06:49:48,480 --> 06:49:50,480
So we have another chance again. Who is?

5549
06:49:51,360 --> 06:49:53,360
Oh, it's the buzzingers

5550
06:49:53,520 --> 06:49:57,040
Oh you oh you want corn. I forgot my apologies

5551
06:49:58,160 --> 06:50:04,720
My apologies you want corn. I forgot about the little side mission that we were doing to get the pigeons to do a wee dance

5552
06:50:05,040 --> 06:50:07,200
right, I'll plant some corn

5553
06:50:09,520 --> 06:50:11,520
And give them

5554
06:50:12,000 --> 06:50:15,600
I'll just plant two in case I'm dumb. I'll give them to

5555
06:50:16,560 --> 06:50:21,120
Now up dragon seeds, so we need press some press X to drop it without

5556
06:50:21,840 --> 06:50:22,880
um

5557
06:50:22,880 --> 06:50:24,240
breathe

5558
06:50:24,240 --> 06:50:26,240
What are you?

5559
06:50:31,280 --> 06:50:33,280
Oh my gosh

5560
06:50:36,880 --> 06:50:38,400
It's actually ac

5561
06:50:45,840 --> 06:50:51,120
Oh, okay, so we have done them all that's fantastic. Okay

5562
06:50:52,880 --> 06:50:58,960
Right, and then what's the last one and we don't know because you haven't eaten that. Okay. Well that would be too easy, wouldn't it?

5563
06:51:00,880 --> 06:51:07,920
Maurice. Oh my god, it is Maurice. Oh king julien. Please let me sniff your feet king julien

5564
06:51:09,920 --> 06:51:11,920
Come here. No

5565
06:51:13,280 --> 06:51:14,720
Hate when they do that

5566
06:51:14,800 --> 06:51:17,840
You stop being so sad and eat this seed

5567
06:51:22,400 --> 06:51:24,400
If you're planting a little corn could call this

5568
06:51:26,480 --> 06:51:29,600
Isn't that mortino? That's morty

5569
06:51:30,640 --> 06:51:34,320
Me mort. I don't even know what animal is based after unfortunately

5570
06:51:35,600 --> 06:51:37,600
Can't recall seeing that

5571
06:51:38,560 --> 06:51:40,560
Have a

5572
06:51:41,120 --> 06:51:43,680
Captain black eye statue in the garden

5573
06:51:44,320 --> 06:51:49,200
What what is it where you pinatas and wanting to stat you in order to hump like I'm starting to what's going on?

5574
06:51:49,280 --> 06:51:52,320
Is it like a monument? Is it like if I was like, oh

5575
06:51:53,040 --> 06:51:56,320
Refland's you need to put a monument to big willy wallace. Um

5576
06:51:59,360 --> 06:52:02,000
In the garden, no, that's a pirate statue

5577
06:52:02,240 --> 06:52:04,240
That

5578
06:52:04,560 --> 06:52:10,800
I've been trolled. Is that what it wants? Is that what they want? No, you don't recognize quality good when they're staring you in the face

5579
06:52:12,960 --> 06:52:14,960
Is that the statue they want?

5580
06:52:18,480 --> 06:52:20,640
You want a random pirate statue?

5581
06:52:23,840 --> 06:52:25,840
I don't think that was the right one

5582
06:52:25,840 --> 06:52:27,840
It what what

5583
06:52:30,640 --> 06:52:32,640
But why

5584
06:52:33,680 --> 06:52:37,360
But why is that the deciding factor if you're comfortable

5585
06:52:39,760 --> 06:52:41,760
How bizarre

5586
06:52:43,840 --> 06:52:45,840
Everyone's snoozing outside

5587
06:52:47,360 --> 06:52:51,680
Oh, there's a a wolf there. I need a wolfie

5588
06:52:52,400 --> 06:52:55,920
Right, I'm gonna buy 10 berries while I'm at it actually

5589
06:52:57,200 --> 06:53:01,440
That statue doesn't get you going. I'm afraid not maybe you know

5590
06:53:02,800 --> 06:53:06,320
Maybe I need to get my leg caught in a bear trap and punched in the face in order to

5591
06:53:07,120 --> 06:53:12,320
You know ink. I don't sorry. That's a really specific meme reference that I adore

5592
06:53:13,680 --> 06:53:15,680
Okay, I've put down 10 berries

5593
06:53:16,480 --> 06:53:19,760
So hopefully try and attract a donut as well while we're at it

5594
06:53:22,640 --> 06:53:25,840
God that statue makes me want to get it on so badly

5595
06:53:28,880 --> 06:53:32,240
I don't know any what's the bounce you could want while I'm music like

5596
06:53:36,800 --> 06:53:43,360
I think that's how it goes a little bit a wee bit something like that something like that

5597
06:53:44,160 --> 06:53:45,760
Oh

5598
06:53:45,760 --> 06:53:47,760
Gem tree or a gem we can sell

5599
06:53:48,640 --> 06:53:53,520
My shopkeeper senses tingling which means that's a good deal. I'm happy to go ahead if you are

5600
06:53:54,160 --> 06:53:56,160
I'm happy to go ahead if you are

5601
06:53:57,600 --> 06:53:59,600
Okay, now we have corn

5602
06:54:01,520 --> 06:54:02,960
We

5603
06:54:02,960 --> 06:54:07,760
Both the pigeons are in sage right now. I could ask them to come out and maybe

5604
06:54:08,480 --> 06:54:11,120
I can get them to eat the missing one to eat the corn

5605
06:54:12,080 --> 06:54:15,280
The chances of them flying back inside are incredibly high

5606
06:54:17,920 --> 06:54:21,280
And they don't listen to your instructions for like five seconds

5607
06:54:22,800 --> 06:54:24,800
Okay, thankfully it didn't fly

5608
06:54:26,240 --> 06:54:29,360
When I get that feeling

5609
06:54:30,800 --> 06:54:33,680
It's deep inside of me

5610
06:54:34,480 --> 06:54:39,200
Yeah, he's flying straight. Okay. It's fine. They can fly back inside at least I know that both of them are able to vomit

5611
06:54:40,160 --> 06:54:41,440
Um

5612
06:54:41,440 --> 06:54:47,600
And then it's fine. I need this eagle to come break open some of these pinatas. I said what I said

5613
06:54:48,960 --> 06:54:55,040
And then once these pigeons have done their thing, I'm going to sell their house and sell them

5614
06:54:56,080 --> 06:54:59,840
And thank them for their services towards the leveling up system

5615
06:55:01,280 --> 06:55:05,840
Okay, can I just say something really bad? I'm so glad I'm a feature. I'm currently itching my

5616
06:55:09,680 --> 06:55:12,160
I'm like straight up touching the nips

5617
06:55:14,800 --> 06:55:16,800
I said, oh the freedom

5618
06:55:16,960 --> 06:55:21,680
When you're a feature for literally and it's like you guys would have no idea if I said otherwise

5619
06:55:22,480 --> 06:55:24,480
Oh, he's back for more. Oh

5620
06:55:25,040 --> 06:55:28,960
Wait, he entered the garden and it registered that he's mine

5621
06:55:30,000 --> 06:55:32,960
Okay, well, I'm selling these and keeping the money of that's okay

5622
06:55:33,760 --> 06:55:36,320
You can't leave right the game's not gonna go like

5623
06:55:39,200 --> 06:55:44,880
Are you squiddin me right now? I've never seen that pigeon shit. Mama. I think you broke my brain earlier

5624
06:55:45,360 --> 06:55:51,520
Every time you mention your garden or a bush. I vividly remember you smacking it to prove it spoiled

5625
06:55:52,640 --> 06:55:54,800
Or don't I actually don't hate it

5626
06:55:55,680 --> 06:55:57,200
Oh

5627
06:55:57,200 --> 06:55:59,200
Thank you wavelength for remembering

5628
06:56:00,720 --> 06:56:02,240
My

5629
06:56:02,240 --> 06:56:04,240
My bold penini

5630
06:56:04,560 --> 06:56:10,720
Thank you for the tip and all of it. That's funny. Okay, if you are saying you've eaten four, I'm not letting you eat anymore

5631
06:56:13,040 --> 06:56:20,160
I don't right get off. I want this pigeon. I'm gonna sell you because I don't want to waste any more money

5632
06:56:22,160 --> 06:56:28,640
And then I'm gonna tell her to release the one she's caught his brain. I broke his brain. Okay. I never ordered anymore

5633
06:56:28,640 --> 06:56:30,640
When you get into

5634
06:56:30,640 --> 06:56:34,880
3d scrawny will be funny. Oh my god. No because it'll give away everything I do

5635
06:56:36,800 --> 06:56:38,800
Remember that what's she doing down there and I'll be like

5636
06:56:40,000 --> 06:56:41,360
smile

5637
06:56:41,360 --> 06:56:45,680
Can't believe she would tease us about the not even sure how to

5638
06:56:47,040 --> 06:56:51,520
I get I said, it's not really messed up. I was like, oh, if there's ever a reason I've lost my boobies

5639
06:56:51,600 --> 06:56:54,000
I would make the most like main ball going

5640
06:56:54,560 --> 06:56:56,560
Oh

5641
06:56:56,800 --> 06:56:58,800
Hold on. I'm having a big stretch

5642
06:56:59,360 --> 06:57:04,640
Master collector. Oh, that's such a nice name for achievement because I only get called a master bear

5643
06:57:06,160 --> 06:57:09,440
Oh, he's like, oh my unique color scheme

5644
06:57:10,960 --> 06:57:12,800
Oh his wings are

5645
06:57:12,800 --> 06:57:17,920
Oh my no, hold on. No, it's not the time dragonfly. No, I don't have a look at him. Sorry

5646
06:57:19,760 --> 06:57:23,440
Where is he? I get you and the first thing you do is take off

5647
06:57:24,560 --> 06:57:26,560
Oh

5648
06:57:26,800 --> 06:57:28,800
It's time

5649
06:57:29,760 --> 06:57:33,520
It's time. Mr. Pigeons. I want to admire you

5650
06:57:35,360 --> 06:57:41,200
It looks like he's the one that's been crapping all over the station America. Wait, is that american?

5651
06:57:42,480 --> 06:57:44,480
A little bit I guess

5652
06:57:45,120 --> 06:57:47,120
We got a donut

5653
06:57:47,200 --> 06:57:48,800
It worked

5654
06:57:48,800 --> 06:57:50,800
It worked

5655
06:57:51,760 --> 06:57:53,760
Oh, no, where'd I go?

5656
06:57:58,880 --> 06:58:02,000
Huh, I didn't mean to do that

5657
06:58:05,840 --> 06:58:10,000
What's going on? How is I even I can't even see what where or what I was supposed to do

5658
06:58:10,720 --> 06:58:13,280
I did it. I did it. We're here. We're here. I did it. I did it. Hey

5659
06:58:15,040 --> 06:58:18,080
It's a love letter. I didn't see where the entrance point was

5660
06:58:18,560 --> 06:58:21,840
I think I was couldn't see the forest for the trees type thing

5661
06:58:23,040 --> 06:58:25,680
Um, right. Where's the donut? Where are you?

5662
06:58:26,480 --> 06:58:33,200
Oh, oh my god, right. So we need you need uh six just go eat mukbang mukbang

5663
06:58:35,440 --> 06:58:39,360
You know do the korean mukbang kansamida annyeong unerun

5664
06:58:41,200 --> 06:58:46,800
Uh, uh-huh. Okay. Okay. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. You stop it. I don't want you in my garden

5665
06:58:46,800 --> 06:58:49,040
You upset my puzzle gums go home

5666
06:58:51,120 --> 06:58:53,440
Very unconventional way to do the minigames, honestly

5667
06:58:54,080 --> 06:58:59,280
I have to leave now. Take care. Take care. Please don't whine. Uh, I'm gonna be wrapping up stream shortly

5668
06:58:59,440 --> 06:59:01,120
This was a good

5669
06:59:01,120 --> 06:59:03,120
entrance way into

5670
06:59:03,120 --> 06:59:04,880
um

5671
06:59:04,880 --> 06:59:06,400
Into what

5672
06:59:06,400 --> 06:59:08,400
And it did an endurance again

5673
06:59:09,520 --> 06:59:13,760
Um, I don't know what we're doing. I think tomorrow we're doing the asmr stream in the bathtub

5674
06:59:13,760 --> 06:59:16,800
So that's going to be fun and you can hear me hear me slap more bold

5675
06:59:18,400 --> 06:59:20,400
Bold parts of my

5676
06:59:21,440 --> 06:59:24,000
I don't know why that was so funny saying it like that. Um

5677
06:59:25,840 --> 06:59:27,840
Okay

5678
06:59:28,640 --> 06:59:30,640
Hello you

5679
06:59:30,880 --> 06:59:34,560
You went three sweet tests. You're one hungry boy. Honestly

5680
06:59:36,320 --> 06:59:41,520
Intro to endurance madness. I'm gonna miss the asmr stream because of work. Oh, I'm so sorry

5681
06:59:41,920 --> 06:59:44,480
I do have more in real life asmr

5682
06:59:44,720 --> 06:59:50,560
I'm not showing my before anyone's like as a camera turned on no for the 15k celebration

5683
06:59:50,640 --> 06:59:56,480
However, I'm going to do thigh asmr and it'll be like a webcam thing. I'm going to see if I can find

5684
06:59:57,520 --> 06:59:58,720
Um

5685
06:59:58,720 --> 07:00:03,920
Psy I think the thigh highs I got will work. I need to test them out for that stream later

5686
07:00:04,000 --> 07:00:08,720
But that's later in august. I think the second week of august is when I'm doing the 15k thing

5687
07:00:09,040 --> 07:00:11,040
Oh, look at the the egg

5688
07:00:11,120 --> 07:00:12,880
right egg there

5689
07:00:12,880 --> 07:00:14,480
building sold

5690
07:00:14,480 --> 07:00:16,000
parents gone

5691
07:00:16,000 --> 07:00:21,120
Child's an orphan got it. Oh almost sold the bird by accident. Well, I'm glad I didn't

5692
07:00:22,480 --> 07:00:24,480
No

5693
07:00:24,880 --> 07:00:27,920
No to get rid of this because it's just taken up room

5694
07:00:28,560 --> 07:00:31,600
Oh, no with the cam we would see the net. No, you wouldn't

5695
07:00:32,320 --> 07:00:35,120
No, you wouldn't the way I'm going to say out the camera. Is it like that?

5696
07:00:35,840 --> 07:00:38,560
My heart can take it so far

5697
07:00:39,520 --> 07:00:47,120
Please crush our heads of your thighs. You got it. No, you're going to upset my baby fuzzling stop it

5698
07:00:48,160 --> 07:00:50,720
Oh, he doesn't even care anymore. He said you watered me once

5699
07:00:52,800 --> 07:00:54,800
Where did that donut go?

5700
07:00:55,920 --> 07:00:57,920
Is it already gone?

5701
07:00:59,440 --> 07:01:02,560
Did the crocodile scare did the wolf scare it?

5702
07:01:02,560 --> 07:01:08,640
Do you do anything? No, hold on. I really need to fart

5703
07:01:17,920 --> 07:01:25,200
I farted are you squidding me right now? Oh my god. I'm so sorry. Thank you. No one has asked today. What color is your ponzu?

5704
07:01:26,880 --> 07:01:31,280
Uh, thank you, doctor. Do nothing for coming a member. I'm so sorry. I farted the moment you did that

5705
07:01:31,360 --> 07:01:35,440
So I couldn't announce it immediately my gratitude for your support

5706
07:01:36,560 --> 07:01:42,800
Um, and broly legend. Thank you for the super chart. Uh, my color. I know I'm wearing pants. It's just gray today

5707
07:01:44,000 --> 07:01:46,000
Boring gray. I'm sorry

5708
07:01:47,280 --> 07:01:49,280
Um

5709
07:01:53,200 --> 07:01:58,160
Stroney, should you crush a watermelon with your thighs? I don't know. You want to find out in the stream?

5710
07:01:58,160 --> 07:02:00,160
Hmm

5711
07:02:00,320 --> 07:02:04,640
Want to find out in the stream? I think snappy might have scared the donut

5712
07:02:05,280 --> 07:02:09,200
I don't know why you didn't eat. I literally bought so much snappy. Do I need to sell you?

5713
07:02:10,800 --> 07:02:16,880
It would be a shame. I don't know why the donut left the garden or is it coming back in?

5714
07:02:18,080 --> 07:02:20,080
It's like on the perimeter

5715
07:02:22,000 --> 07:02:24,000
Hmm

5716
07:02:24,080 --> 07:02:27,840
Please yes, please send me to the ER. I mean we could find out

5717
07:02:32,640 --> 07:02:36,320
Ezekiel's horn called the moment you members literally

5718
07:02:39,360 --> 07:02:42,720
Oh, this is a big eagle the eagle must take up some room

5719
07:02:43,920 --> 07:02:46,160
I think snappy takes up a lot of room as well

5720
07:02:46,960 --> 07:02:49,200
Wearing pants through unheard of well

5721
07:02:49,760 --> 07:02:52,720
I can't say that but when my dad got here

5722
07:02:53,200 --> 07:02:57,920
I had to get used to wearing clothes again and like showering every day like and like

5723
07:02:58,640 --> 07:03:02,560
I don't want to say it like a normal person. But as the average person does

5724
07:03:04,320 --> 07:03:08,480
Like and I did I need to go shower

5725
07:03:09,680 --> 07:03:13,600
But I'm gonna I'm gonna nap or sleep whatever happens first

5726
07:03:13,600 --> 07:03:17,280
It doesn't really matter if I nap or sleep as long as I'm awake before stream

5727
07:03:17,680 --> 07:03:20,080
I'm going to try and wake up one hour before stream

5728
07:03:20,080 --> 07:03:25,520
So I can record whatever ASMR I need to get done and then I know that the file is sitting there to be edited

5729
07:03:26,080 --> 07:03:30,640
You really could have eaten more berries. I'm gonna be honest. You could have been mine

5730
07:03:30,800 --> 07:03:34,080
But I don't know what spooked you. I don't know if the wolf might spoke to deer that

5731
07:03:35,760 --> 07:03:42,080
My your eyes going red. I don't know if that's a mistake or like a really cool thing that he does

5732
07:03:43,040 --> 07:03:49,120
No, no shower and slips at home bed feeling if you do it. I'll make a scene out. She became a normie. It's ogre

5733
07:03:49,280 --> 07:03:50,400
I know

5734
07:03:50,400 --> 07:03:54,640
Like I got used to wearing clothes like I've got clothes on now because I got used to wearing it

5735
07:03:54,640 --> 07:03:56,640
But I think if you just give me some time

5736
07:03:57,200 --> 07:03:59,360
Before you know it, you'll hear me slap everything

5737
07:04:00,720 --> 07:04:05,840
Like like oh god, that's terrible. Okay, but it's true. So is it really terrible?

5738
07:04:05,920 --> 07:04:09,360
Right that donut doesn't know what to do with itself. It wants in

5739
07:04:09,360 --> 07:04:14,800
Take them off it's so over shiver time. Let me in

5740
07:04:15,520 --> 07:04:17,520
We're doing a bath tomorrow

5741
07:04:17,600 --> 07:04:22,160
But I think I'm gonna get clean before I go in the bath. I feel like if I went in the bath stinky, I'll be like

5742
07:04:22,880 --> 07:04:24,880
Here's soap ASMR

5743
07:04:25,120 --> 07:04:28,400
And it's like actually me just straight up like soap cleaning myself with a

5744
07:04:29,760 --> 07:04:31,600
Can you

5745
07:04:31,600 --> 07:04:36,160
I'm so sorry to do this little malo. Can you go all the way with reefing over here?

5746
07:04:37,040 --> 07:04:39,600
Just because I think you might be scaring

5747
07:04:41,120 --> 07:04:45,440
The donut of the doughnuts now going home. Well we're blower chances

5748
07:04:46,720 --> 07:04:52,880
I'm going to put some berries on the perimeter in case it wants the berries but it's too scared to come closer

5749
07:04:54,560 --> 07:04:56,160
No feminine

5750
07:04:56,160 --> 07:04:58,160
pheromone maxing

5751
07:04:59,200 --> 07:05:01,760
She's going to start playing the guitar with no guitar

5752
07:05:02,720 --> 07:05:10,240
Is that does that mean what I think it means? Who is honking? Oh the eagles honking

5753
07:05:17,360 --> 07:05:22,800
I can't hatched. Okay, we can sell the pigeon but it's going up in the tree. I was always does

5754
07:05:24,240 --> 07:05:28,720
How much for stone is that? Oh, you do not want that. That's a biohazard and a tub

5755
07:05:32,080 --> 07:05:37,280
We brieflings can clean you. Oh, I need to make sure I put that asset on screen

5756
07:05:37,760 --> 07:05:40,720
Because I'll be setting obs up here

5757
07:05:41,200 --> 07:05:48,880
But I'll be taking my phone away like into the bathroom on a tripod with the 3d o on a tripod

5758
07:05:49,760 --> 07:05:53,120
And like twisting myself to look at you if that makes sense

5759
07:05:53,840 --> 07:05:58,240
So do pre-prepared. I think it will be less than an hour

5760
07:05:58,720 --> 07:06:02,720
Unfortunately Vigo and Gimli are going to have to be locked in

5761
07:06:03,680 --> 07:06:08,240
My bedroom because if they knocked something over

5762
07:06:09,840 --> 07:06:13,200
Then it would be game over because it's a lot of expensive equipment

5763
07:06:13,200 --> 07:06:17,360
Well, the 3d was the most expensive equipment, but I don't want any issues

5764
07:06:18,000 --> 07:06:22,880
And I can only read chat on phone. I will only be able to read

5765
07:06:23,520 --> 07:06:28,000
Super chats on YouTube. So I'll put a notification just say if you give me stream elements

5766
07:06:28,000 --> 07:06:33,600
I will not be able to read it just for this stream in particular because I need to read you off of my phone

5767
07:06:35,120 --> 07:06:36,080
Yeah

5768
07:06:36,080 --> 07:06:38,080
Do they freak out when you take a bath?

5769
07:06:38,560 --> 07:06:43,600
They they always come and check on me when I take a bath because I take such a long bath and they're like

5770
07:06:43,680 --> 07:06:46,560
Oh, what are you doing? I'm just like I'm still in the bath

5771
07:06:47,680 --> 07:06:51,280
Take talking away and then they'll go away again and do their thing

5772
07:06:52,960 --> 07:06:58,960
Yeah, give Gimli freedom. I don't want to risk the equipment. I don't know if that's selfish of me

5773
07:06:59,200 --> 07:07:04,480
Can you stop napping next to the berries? I think you're genuinely going to be upset in the doughnut

5774
07:07:04,480 --> 07:07:07,120
I asked you to go over here darlin. Please go over there

5775
07:07:09,680 --> 07:07:15,680
I'm trying to get a doughnut it comes from this hill somewhere, but I don't know where oh, there's a broken kayak

5776
07:07:15,680 --> 07:07:18,160
Do you see the yellow broken kayak upstream?

5777
07:07:19,520 --> 07:07:21,360
Hmm

5778
07:07:21,360 --> 07:07:23,360
Like an abandoned log cabin

5779
07:07:24,160 --> 07:07:27,520
Hmm. Hmm. This is a leaf off this house

5780
07:07:28,480 --> 07:07:30,720
A little honeycomb and it goes a little to the left

5781
07:07:32,160 --> 07:07:36,560
And then that's the workers house is up there and that's town village with a wee point

5782
07:07:41,520 --> 07:07:43,520
Pretty good

5783
07:07:44,320 --> 07:07:47,520
Here is the parents keep out

5784
07:07:48,960 --> 07:07:51,760
That's cute plant versus zombies

5785
07:07:54,320 --> 07:07:57,920
Wait, you what why are you in here you dober? I don't have any buzzing just

5786
07:07:58,800 --> 07:08:02,080
So, please don't attack any of my babies no more

5787
07:08:03,360 --> 07:08:05,360
I'm gonna see if I can get

5788
07:08:06,400 --> 07:08:08,400
Malil will

5789
07:08:08,800 --> 07:08:10,800
Right you're starting to take

5790
07:08:10,960 --> 07:08:15,360
The lady humps now you have the entire map to sleep and you keep picking there

5791
07:08:16,160 --> 07:08:22,400
For that reason alone. I would build you a house, but if you do not use it you are getting sold

5792
07:08:23,280 --> 07:08:26,800
Because I think it's genuine. Why is your house so long?

5793
07:08:28,560 --> 07:08:30,560
Shopping

5794
07:08:31,760 --> 07:08:37,440
No work for sprinkling right i'm so sorry, but I think snappy has to go. I think he's just taken out far too much room

5795
07:08:38,960 --> 07:08:42,080
I think maybe the banana tree as well

5796
07:08:44,960 --> 07:08:46,320
I don't know

5797
07:08:46,320 --> 07:08:49,440
I feel like we have a lot of bushes and stuff that the game's not happy

5798
07:08:50,320 --> 07:08:54,480
I'm so sorry, but snappy takes up so much room. I think the game keeps um

5799
07:08:55,840 --> 07:08:59,040
Thinking that he's like multiple things

5800
07:08:59,200 --> 07:09:04,960
I noticed like the dragonfly was considered two items and i'm like, bro that thing's a literal atom on my screen

5801
07:09:04,960 --> 07:09:06,960
Oh

5802
07:09:07,600 --> 07:09:09,600
It's the donut coming down from the hill

5803
07:09:12,160 --> 07:09:14,320
Please I want the donut before I go

5804
07:09:17,520 --> 07:09:20,800
I like the eagles flying around it's like majestic actually

5805
07:09:22,240 --> 07:09:26,400
Should I check I'll check I'll see what the game says about how full the garden is

5806
07:09:27,360 --> 07:09:29,360
Hmm

5807
07:09:29,680 --> 07:09:35,760
What like why does the tower of sour get registered if it's literally nothing to do with me

5808
07:09:38,000 --> 07:09:44,640
Like so your house is considered two. Are you even considered one? I can't actually see you

5809
07:09:48,000 --> 07:09:50,800
Are you're considered one your house is considered two

5810
07:09:51,520 --> 07:09:56,720
The berries on the floor apparently the bananas and acorns on the floor are taking up space

5811
07:09:57,520 --> 07:10:02,960
I say it's a bit multiple bananas. I guess that includes in the tree as well because what

5812
07:10:04,720 --> 07:10:06,720
What

5813
07:10:08,400 --> 07:10:10,400
Ridiculous

5814
07:10:11,040 --> 07:10:13,040
No when you're doing it

5815
07:10:13,360 --> 07:10:14,880
cousin

5816
07:10:14,880 --> 07:10:16,880
if your

5817
07:10:17,680 --> 07:10:20,480
Cousin Nico do you want to go bowling?

5818
07:10:21,600 --> 07:10:25,840
I want the donut to spawn. I don't want these guys. I want the donut

5819
07:10:28,800 --> 07:10:30,160
Come on

5820
07:10:30,160 --> 07:10:34,480
Please AI i'm passing out here. I'm trying so hard to stay awake

5821
07:10:35,760 --> 07:10:37,280
my voice

5822
07:10:37,280 --> 07:10:42,880
My voice is starting to hurt. Why are you giving me dragonflies? I already have dragonflies

5823
07:10:43,120 --> 07:10:46,480
Please I don't even meet the requirements of anything

5824
07:10:49,680 --> 07:10:56,000
Oh, I'm perishing. I'm not gonna make it. I'm so tired. I'm fighting so hard right now

5825
07:10:57,760 --> 07:11:01,440
Please please donut show up

5826
07:11:07,680 --> 07:11:11,200
Okay, mr. Wolf you're going into your house right now

5827
07:11:11,200 --> 07:11:15,200
I don't know what your house looks like but you're going for it mr. Wolf

5828
07:11:17,200 --> 07:11:19,200
That's a wolf then oh

5829
07:11:19,920 --> 07:11:22,400
That makes sense. What does the inside look like?

5830
07:11:24,080 --> 07:11:28,240
I thought he said uh, I may have been going to sleep after the what are those symbols

5831
07:11:28,720 --> 07:11:30,720
They've got like wolf talisman

5832
07:11:31,920 --> 07:11:35,200
And then gem i've never looked inside the home of a wolf

5833
07:11:35,600 --> 07:11:37,600
Uh

5834
07:11:39,120 --> 07:11:42,800
Right go to sleep in your home. Maybe that'll fix your red eyes honestly

5835
07:11:44,880 --> 07:11:46,880
Although he might want to fight with

5836
07:11:46,960 --> 07:11:49,680
Uh, I don't know if he might give me an achievement

5837
07:11:50,000 --> 07:11:54,240
I think the baboon gives me an achievement if I fight death dordos with him

5838
07:11:56,560 --> 07:12:00,000
I can't tell if that was an in-game noise or if my cat's at the door

5839
07:12:01,440 --> 07:12:03,440
Yimli

5840
07:12:05,280 --> 07:12:07,280
I think gimme's at the door

5841
07:12:12,240 --> 07:12:16,160
Now I'm going great. I'm losing it. I can now hear my children yell for me

5842
07:12:19,200 --> 07:12:21,920
Well, you're my child too, especially after the time

5843
07:12:23,440 --> 07:12:24,960
If someone

5844
07:12:24,960 --> 07:12:29,760
Oh, was that just wait can I minute I think if I do magic on the

5845
07:12:30,800 --> 07:12:32,800
Jen something happened

5846
07:12:33,440 --> 07:12:35,440
Or did I make that up?

5847
07:12:37,520 --> 07:12:45,920
You little shit go home go home. Oh my god, his eyes almost popped out of his socket

5848
07:12:49,360 --> 07:12:51,360
Give me the donor

5849
07:12:51,920 --> 07:12:58,880
I can't stop giving me the freaking ants. Oh my god the game thinks I'm one that ants because of the purple thing

5850
07:12:59,520 --> 07:13:06,640
This is the rng. I think the wolf will square up with ruffians. Oh already bought the cutlass. Oh, there's the donut there

5851
07:13:10,320 --> 07:13:15,840
If the wolf can stay in his house and if the donut can eat six whole fruits that would be great

5852
07:13:17,840 --> 07:13:19,840
Come on make go home

5853
07:13:21,280 --> 07:13:25,200
Is there anyone in my garden that is hanging around that I don't want?

5854
07:13:26,640 --> 07:13:28,640
Go home

5855
07:13:29,040 --> 07:13:31,040
Unless you want to die

5856
07:13:31,760 --> 07:13:33,760
No quiet, but

5857
07:13:36,000 --> 07:13:38,000
Mr. Raisin go home

5858
07:13:40,080 --> 07:13:42,080
Oh

5859
07:13:49,120 --> 07:13:51,520
He never came into my garden

5860
07:13:52,160 --> 07:13:54,160
I

5861
07:13:54,960 --> 07:13:58,880
I'm trying so hard. I don't know if I can do another day. Please

5862
07:14:00,080 --> 07:14:02,080
Stop this madness. I literally

5863
07:14:02,800 --> 07:14:06,000
Was it you or do the reason he didn't come in the garden?

5864
07:14:07,120 --> 07:14:10,560
I swear if it was you we're gonna have trouble mr. Eagle

5865
07:14:11,920 --> 07:14:13,920
Why is there an there's an L

5866
07:14:15,120 --> 07:14:20,880
What do you want black berries? I mean sure. Why not? You can have some blackberries

5867
07:14:21,520 --> 07:14:25,440
Maybe I'll have better luck getting a freaking elephant than I do a deer

5868
07:14:26,400 --> 07:14:28,400
Right, go have some blackberries. Okay

5869
07:14:30,960 --> 07:14:32,960
Go move

5870
07:14:33,520 --> 07:14:38,720
Oh, no the eyes are red on this. Okay. I think his eyes are naturally red because it's also like that in the house go

5871
07:14:40,000 --> 07:14:45,040
Go eat those things and then I'll figure out what you want to eat afterwards. Okay

5872
07:14:45,840 --> 07:14:47,840
Please don't trample my reefing

5873
07:14:48,640 --> 07:14:50,640
Okay, thank you reefing be careful there's

5874
07:14:51,600 --> 07:14:53,600
Okay, one

5875
07:14:54,960 --> 07:14:58,640
No reefing. No, I'm sorry reefing. I'll fix it. Okay

5876
07:14:59,920 --> 07:15:04,160
Mommy'll make it better. I'll get you some sweets today has been a good day for customers

5877
07:15:06,160 --> 07:15:08,160
Only strong he can trample

5878
07:15:09,760 --> 07:15:16,480
Right reefing this will make you feel better. Okay, darlin you grab that mr. Eagle you grab that

5879
07:15:17,440 --> 07:15:22,080
And uh mr. Wernling you grab this one

5880
07:15:24,240 --> 07:15:29,440
Why did you go a bit straight back to say why does everyone like camping out at the berry bushes? Is it like the perfect height?

5881
07:15:32,320 --> 07:15:35,680
Please eat more berries on the floor so I can discover what you would like

5882
07:15:39,920 --> 07:15:43,600
There's berries on the floor you don't need to break them off the tree

5883
07:15:47,440 --> 07:15:49,840
You know what as long as you're happy that's the main thing

5884
07:15:51,760 --> 07:15:54,000
Reefing has his air pods and he can hear you

5885
07:15:55,760 --> 07:16:00,000
Like you feel better though now. Where are you? That's not you. Oh, you're going back home. Okay, you went home

5886
07:16:02,560 --> 07:16:08,320
Ah, please mr. Game. I wish the flowers could last longer. I don't know how to do it though

5887
07:16:08,400 --> 07:16:10,400
I don't know if there's an item for it. Maybe

5888
07:16:11,680 --> 07:16:15,200
I feel like I put so much effort to make them look a certain way in the games like

5889
07:16:16,720 --> 07:16:18,720
Hey, mr. Elephant you want to eat that?

5890
07:16:20,720 --> 07:16:26,000
Wait, why did you get sad? You didn't even get trampled you got startled but not trampled

5891
07:16:26,800 --> 07:16:28,800
That's two different things

5892
07:16:30,160 --> 07:16:33,280
Okay, okay, is that three is that four? No

5893
07:16:35,280 --> 07:16:39,680
Mummy would you rather have a fresh berry off the bush or one that's been on

5894
07:16:40,800 --> 07:16:45,840
How dare you use such logic on little reflames

5895
07:16:47,200 --> 07:16:54,320
Okay, what would you like now? Okay, you still not had that's three you've had eat a fourth one. My goodness. You're an elephant. Hurry up

5896
07:16:58,720 --> 07:17:00,720
Have a fourth one

5897
07:17:01,920 --> 07:17:06,880
Please i'm trying my best to obtain you and you're making this so difficult

5898
07:17:07,440 --> 07:17:12,000
Is this turning into a 12 hour stream? I really need a rest. I have to admit i'm struggling

5899
07:17:12,960 --> 07:17:15,360
Mummy lost her endurance and he had bring it back

5900
07:17:16,080 --> 07:17:21,600
I think maybe I think what it was is because I also woke up early to write asmr

5901
07:17:22,480 --> 07:17:24,480
Right to record. Okay, and they're going back

5902
07:17:27,760 --> 07:17:32,640
And the donut is nowhere inside and it's not going to be in sight probably

5903
07:17:37,680 --> 07:17:39,680
Eight hours in sleep

5904
07:17:40,560 --> 07:17:44,960
Oh, so i need to be a good girl. Go get some rest, please. I'm actually i'm quite tired

5905

I can't help but imagine you on my lap my big soft stomach between us and you

5971
07:23:03,120 --> 07:23:07,040
Slipping food between my lips as you bounce and I slip my meat between you

5972
07:23:09,440 --> 07:23:11,440
I thought that was not going there

5973
07:23:11,600 --> 07:23:13,600
I don't I get surprised every time

5974
07:23:13,840 --> 07:23:18,560
Because like the build-up is wholesome and then like my brain like all completes what's gonna come up next

5975
07:23:19,040 --> 07:23:21,920
I cannot read half of these at large

5976
07:23:22,320 --> 07:23:24,320

5977
07:23:24,720 --> 07:23:30,320
Literally the one directly below I want to stuff my face while I stuff mommy's mouth. Okay, dude

5978
07:23:33,760 --> 07:23:35,440
Um

5979
07:23:35,440 --> 07:23:41,040
Thank you so so much. I'm going to redirect into me as always when I redirect into another streamer

5980
07:23:41,120 --> 07:23:44,880
Please my darling reflings, you know to behave that they might not act like mean

5981
07:23:45,760 --> 07:23:48,960
Fuck and give a fuck like me. Sorry. That was like an M&M line that I

5982
07:23:49,600 --> 07:23:52,480
Might talk like me walk like me not give one like me

5983
07:23:52,880 --> 07:23:54,000
and

5984
07:23:54,000 --> 07:23:58,960
I love when she gets tricked into letting her guard down mid-mouth stop because I can't read a head like that

5985
07:23:59,600 --> 07:24:04,240
Okay, thank you so so much reflings for this testing and during stream. We're testing it

5986
07:24:04,240 --> 07:24:05,840
We're slowly getting back into it

5987
07:24:05,840 --> 07:24:10,560
No tomorrow is going to be shorter because I'm doing that asmr and then I'm doing a member if I'm not wrong

5988
07:24:11,120 --> 07:24:12,000
I may be wrong

5989
07:24:12,000 --> 07:24:17,040
But it might help to kind of balance to do like a longer one and then a shorter one to kind of thinking it

5990
07:24:18,000 --> 07:24:20,560
What you saying is to not be us

5991
07:24:21,280 --> 07:24:23,280
What no

5992
07:24:23,280 --> 07:24:29,200
Yeah, the streamers are at different comfort levels. They might not enjoy like I like when you guys are all

5993
07:24:30,000 --> 07:24:31,360
H word

5994
07:24:31,360 --> 07:24:35,520
But other streamers might not appreciate it. That's what I'm trying to say. You know what I mean?

5995
07:24:38,320 --> 07:24:42,960
Okay members carry okay, just to really f up my voice after ASMR let's go

5996
07:24:43,920 --> 07:24:45,520
Okay, we'll do it though

5997
07:24:45,520 --> 07:24:49,840
Okay, we'll do a laugh. Okay. I will see goofy givers tomorrow. I'm going to be directing to me

5998
07:24:50,000 --> 07:24:54,080
Please don't be afraid to say hi. I'll chill it for a couple of hot seconds

5999
07:24:54,160 --> 07:24:58,720
But I will have to go lie down unfortunately or else. I'm not going to be able to work. Okay
