thought okay I do apologize for the stream being two hours later but the

55
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:28,520
best time zone for everyone to come to to come and congregate and it was at my

56
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:33,040
usual time and this is going to be a bit of a shorter stream because again oh I

151
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:33,720
1.5 each King held in the hand gives a multiplier played cards with a heart

152
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:39,000

00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:32,200
face card yeah fantastic cheese a suit plus three of a kind is that viable not

159
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:40,080
quite but we're here to do it one plus hand size curious one plus hand size

160
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:48,520
that would enable us to get our three of a kind more I know this has a chance to

161
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:52,840
be destroyed I don't want to spend economy now to get destroyed so I'm

162

two dollars interest anyway we're getting we're only getting two dollars

204
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:46,240
DJ and doker and Uranus a straight and a high high card as straight I feel like

205
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:51,680
might actually come up more than well two pairs is kind of a Hail Mary for us so

206
00:21:51,680 --> 00:22:00,080
I'll go Uranus he's a troublemaker right next round all diamond cards are

207
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:05,600
debuff that's fine I don't really think that's a problem right we did just

208
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:13,880
double up pairs a upgrade pair so we're gonna send it and we unlock to Joker

209
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:19,520

213
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:48,400
Joker gets more money through more hands oops wait what over wait what this one

214
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:56,960

00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:05,040
with it I'm gonna redeem the foil holographic so we're back down to two

217
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:09,200
economy pair round but that's fine that's fine we're still cooking discard

218
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:19,600
$1 pair use card what will give you 12 bucks sorry I don't understand if I

219
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:25,240

220
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:29,440
need this half Joker because let's be honest I'm just playing doubles again

221
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:36,880

225
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:05,680
not read that properly but look this is why we learning on screen I was wondering

226
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:09,920
if I should record solo runs of me playing this and upload it as actual

227
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:14,760
like video content like oh this is the best one I've had but I don't know if

228
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:22,000
that's weird you can triple to occur so you play so you play five hands with

229
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:26,480
one times and one oh no okay that's not for me

230
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:37,680
spectral card spectral card I have no idea what's a spectral card is that the

231
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:42,960
one where it turns the card gold in that and no that would actually can kill

232
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:47,920
fee free to make some videos yes some people try it you know what try I will

235
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:07,280
shove a discard because it's easier to discard than have it sitting on your hand

236
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:14,360
rotten away okay I like it I like it next round let's go what are you three

266
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:44,640
specific question what happens do you want me to start rapping this one's for

267
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:49,840
the boys with a booming system top-down AC with a cooling system when they come

00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:54,080
up in the club I'd be blazing up they got stacks on stacks on decks like they

269
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:58,520
save it up is that what you wanted to hear to be honest

270
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:05,360
okay I finished my tea I actually finished my tea and I'm hydrated think

271
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:10,360
of the economy I know it's in shambles because people are paying off their debts

272
00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:16,360
in society is built for you to be indebted and sleep planet cards appear more

273
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:23,840
frequently played face cards have a chance to give me money

274
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:35,480
I'll take it you have to tell me twice I'm wondering oh right if I do this I get

275
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:42,800
$3 if I do this I get $1 in interest which is really greedy but I kind of

276
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:50,920
want planets or what saved the run I'm sorry but mummy's gambling after

277
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:58,760
defeating the boss gain 25 extra hmm next-based addition there's a free thing

278
00:29:58,760 --> 00:30:12,160
a extra large blind soon made the strongy man come to bring us reef flings soon

279
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:17,320

thought it was so bad sounded just like her honestly I'm actually Nicki Minaj

283
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:38,320

284
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:42,240

on speakers oh there we go nice and quiet the gulping in the burps made me

300
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:38,000
think of Emmys Pandario I listened to that for the first time yesterday I was

301
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:41,400
actually too scared to listen to it and I listened to it and I was like oh wow

I actually don't mind we're losing her to the gambon yeah move the polychrome

303
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:55,960
Joker to the far right it will give you most mullies in that position see I

304
00:32:55,960 --> 00:33:00,880
don't know how you guys know that but it's so good you guys are so smart right

305
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:06,480
this is useless we're gonna keep economy keep economy choose one of three

306
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:15,200
playing cards to add to the deck oh wait hold on what a waste of fucking money

307
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:26,480
were you next base it becomes a polychrome 1.5 multi what the sigma first

308
00:33:26,520 --> 00:33:33,640
played face card gives to multi I might skip in order to get this 1.5 multi one

309
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:38,280
because you're starting to you're starting to grind my gears and you're

310
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:45,240
not really doing too much I can't reroll the boss if I decide to 20k wall is a

311
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:52,600
risk are you sure I feel like I make so much money I'm like doing this in one

312
00:33:52,600 --> 00:34:00,280
round I have four hands personally played up to purple steak with a few

313
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:07,200
deck oh do we do it jokers activate left to right yeah if you wanted the audio

314
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:11,560
it'd be more realistic there'd be a kiss if you need gulp and burping

315
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:18,800
photograph but can't photograph is kind of weak yeah if you skip you go straight

316
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:23,360
to the boss though purple steak is doable if you've got the good jokers

317
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:30,480
you will have to fish for the full house to save the wall shit okay what does it

318
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:38,440
mean right I'm gonna trade out this for a 1.5 multiplier I can't play my last

mode and see how far we get now I do know endless mode things get out of

775
01:30:56,760 --> 01:31:00,640
control like so quickly and

776
01:31:04,640 --> 01:31:10,440
spectral sure I know I spent all my economy we're not try hard and don't

777
01:31:10,440 --> 01:31:18,200
worry we're not try hard and add a foil effect to a selected card convert all

778
01:31:18,200 --> 01:31:23,960
cards into a single random one convert all cards in hand to a single random

779
01:31:23,960 --> 01:31:35,080
suit sure we'll do we'll do you why not we're not gonna last long in unlimited

780
01:31:35,080 --> 01:31:40,320
mode it just it just never runs with move the second Joker to the right yeah

781
01:31:40,320 --> 01:31:45,400

782
01:31:45,400 --> 01:31:49,720
that don't think I don't remember how I had you say oh anyway I know exactly how

783
01:31:49,720 --> 01:31:55,400
I say look okay we're gonna do that as well yeah why not

784
01:31:55,400 --> 01:31:59,040
skip blame no there's no playing skip and we'll just play every round but what

785
01:31:59,040 --> 01:32:04,160
do you do enhances to selected cards to a multi-card sure show views on you to

786
01:32:04,160 --> 01:32:12,480
them multi-card and then look wow yeah

787
01:32:12,760 --> 01:32:21,320
we've got an upgrade in our pair of pantyloons we're still one shot in oh my

788
01:32:21,320 --> 01:32:32,160
god he's twitching he's ready oh oh okay let's do this and then you already

789
01:32:32,160 --> 01:32:38,320
know what we're doing I don't even know how high this can go 21 yeah we can get

790
01:32:38,320 --> 01:32:46,200
to 30 before the game ends I don't know that card is rubbing right I'm not

791
01:32:46,200 --> 01:32:53,280
looking at the skips anymore I don't want okay I see nine

792
01:32:54,880 --> 01:33:02,640
everything has well I don't know how that worked out but it did oh no I could

793
01:33:02,640 --> 01:33:08,880
it in a full house and that would have no not two pairs way more effective

794
01:33:09,160 --> 01:33:24,000
oh oh this is the big most insane run ever I'm sorry but hello oh my gosh I

795
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:30,480
think his urinus is keeping up with the things planet cards appear more

796
01:33:30,480 --> 01:33:34,960
frequently I'm tempted I feel like because we're going all in on doubles

797
01:33:34,960 --> 01:33:39,060
I'm sorry if that was the bad choice I feel like cuz we're going all in on

798
01:33:39,060 --> 01:33:43,400
doubles all heart cards are debuff does not make a difference to me I sure you

799
01:33:43,400 --> 01:33:50,520
may like it's just one insane

800
01:33:51,160 --> 01:33:59,080

01:47:03,160 --> 01:47:12,440
doing any of this stuff after defeating the boss get 25 all face cards are drawn

898
01:47:12,440 --> 01:47:22,200

899

903
01:47:57,160 --> 01:48:04,120
to play all of this and then I'm gonna play five of the face down card oh well

904
01:48:04,120 --> 01:48:13,160
that actually worked out really well somehow I don't know how but yeah that

905
01:48:13,320 --> 01:48:21,160
went really well um I'm just gonna keep doing this okay and then we're gonna play all five

906
01:48:23,560 --> 01:48:31,080
four of a cane yeah I was a bit overkill for that one I'm not gonna lie it worked look it worked

907

01:48:58,440 --> 01:49:00,120
like to shape it please

911
01:49:03,720 --> 01:49:09,000
doubles all listed probabilities is that good I've not discovered it

912
01:49:11,480 --> 01:49:14,920
scammed yeah honestly take the blank but yeah

913
01:49:18,280 --> 01:49:25,880
doubles all listed probabilities I think run a flush deck this time okay let's try flush

914
01:49:25,960 --> 01:49:34,440
all the same color flush it down the toilet that's how it works three of a cane

915
01:49:38,440 --> 01:49:39,640
is that what we want

916
01:49:42,360 --> 01:49:46,680
more just cards it's easier to find a suit okay all the same color

917
01:49:46,680 --> 01:49:50,840
you're starting to get a bit me

918
01:49:53,240 --> 01:49:54,680

919
01:49:57,560 --> 01:50:02,200

925
01:50:36,040 --> 01:50:38,760
yeah that's what I thought that's what I thought

926
01:50:40,680 --> 01:50:49,480
yeah that's what I thought freaking getting trolled you can sort by suit okay I will remember that

927
01:50:50,200 --> 01:50:58,760
uh don't need tariffs and stuff sorry I would I just want to save my economy I don't know

928
01:51:00,840 --> 01:51:06,520
I want to get 50 economy I'm not I'm I don't feel very confident about our run I'm being honest

929
01:51:08,040 --> 01:51:17,640
unless unless unless unless the tarot cards I can start swapping deck to like one deck color

930
01:51:18,520 --> 01:51:23,560
shit you only get five interest right now anyway

931
01:51:36,680 --> 01:51:39,960
I guess it's wheel of fortune who do I want to on though like

932
01:51:40,520 --> 01:51:41,020
me

933
01:51:45,320 --> 01:51:49,480
please the last tire or planet card use none so it's not gonna do anything

934
01:51:50,840 --> 01:51:55,480
either stencil or bluish the hanged man destroy

935
01:51:56,680 --> 01:52:03,880
fuck it the wheel fuck it I love a good gamble oh oh I'm gonna get rid of that if I'm in trouble

936
01:52:04,680 --> 01:52:14,040
oh well I tried okay let's see what's going on here create two random tarot cards sure

937
01:52:14,840 --> 01:52:23,720
what we got two planet doubles money sure don't mind if I do create up to two random

938
01:52:23,720 --> 01:52:32,360
planet cards okay I'm going for a flush I tried doesn't mean I got it but I'll upgrade these just

939
01:52:32,360 --> 01:52:39,000
in case I find myself in a rough spot when blind is selected destroy joker to the right and

940
01:52:39,000 --> 01:52:45,160
permanently I double itself out I don't get that at first hand of round has only one card no

941
01:52:46,200 --> 01:52:50,680
okay knife will get stronger both destroying jokers and will enhance stencil

942
01:52:50,760 --> 01:52:51,260
so

943
01:52:55,560 --> 01:52:57,880
they won't paramount enhance stencil

944
01:53:00,600 --> 01:53:03,560
I'm gonna end up leaving stencil behind

945
01:53:06,920 --> 01:53:13,320
and wait hold on hold on hold on hold on hold on let me think let me think let me think

946
01:53:14,280 --> 01:53:22,600
if I actually sell these two no they have temples multi oh I can't do math

947
01:53:24,120 --> 01:53:31,080
oh my head is spinning stencil needs sell yes that's what I'm thinking get rid of stencil

948
01:53:31,080 --> 01:53:36,360
for better stuff that comes in okay we're getting rid of stencil I'm sorry I'm sorry if it's the wrong

949
01:53:36,360 --> 01:53:41,720
choice but I want rid of stencil right if it's all the same color flush it down what we got

950
01:53:41,720 --> 01:53:46,840
we've got three hearts and we've got three jacks

951
01:53:49,320 --> 01:53:51,560
and the deck is equal as it can be

952
01:53:57,240 --> 01:54:01,800
oh I need to commit to one color what do you want heart

953
01:54:02,600 --> 01:54:12,440
think hard think hard me think hard are you joking I'm a dumber okay we got another heart

954
01:54:15,720 --> 01:54:17,240
okay we got no heart

955
01:54:19,880 --> 01:54:23,320
finally one two three four five go

956
01:54:24,280 --> 01:54:34,680
okay that's good that's good we are ahead but we're gonna need to get some juicy upgrades

957
01:54:34,680 --> 01:54:41,160
what do you do 10 multiplier if you click no uh face face cards give a

958
01:54:43,640 --> 01:54:46,120
they are not making this one easy really crap

959
01:54:46,200 --> 01:54:54,120
select two to convert the ray creates a random joker must have room what we do random joker

960
01:54:55,080 --> 01:54:56,200
our emperor again

961
01:54:59,000 --> 01:55:03,080
I don't know I like doing the wheel just for the hell of it if this flush could grab the wheel

962
01:55:03,080 --> 01:55:12,680
that'd be great wheel move wrestler in front yes sorry sorry sell stencil fuck you bitch

963
01:55:13,240 --> 01:55:15,800
that's right I'm good at listening

964
01:55:16,680 --> 01:55:21,400
so stencil can't pick up the wheel okay so I want to sell locador

965
01:55:23,000 --> 01:55:29,560
I'm leaving him to win because if he picks up the wheel again I'm gonna be pissed

966
01:55:30,840 --> 01:55:34,520
okay no one got the wheel that's fine um

967
01:55:35,400 --> 01:55:35,900
um

968
01:55:37,800 --> 01:55:42,040
I honestly I'm needing something to help with these fluffy

969
01:55:44,280 --> 01:55:50,120
nothing's kind of helping me have pick up smells sure

970
01:55:52,840 --> 01:55:56,360
wow nothing's really helping me though we're not really getting shaped

971
01:55:58,680 --> 01:56:01,080
I don't give a fuck oh wait shit I do

972
01:56:05,320 --> 01:56:12,600
I'm sure I'll hit something fuck that was awful

973
01:56:14,920 --> 01:56:20,120
fuck it ah right what color diamonds I've got three

974
01:56:25,640 --> 01:56:31,720
okay did I just lose like so many diamonds in that pack am I going crazy

975
01:56:35,480 --> 01:56:41,880
so there's hardly any diamonds in the pack that three are on the board that's why and I used to

976
01:56:43,880 --> 01:56:51,320
oh you know what all these and then go for clubs clubs have a higher chance

977
01:56:54,920 --> 01:56:58,920
and not clubs the other one no one two three four

978
01:56:59,560 --> 01:57:07,240
right so I just need one more then oh my god I'm so sorry I'm just joking right it's hard

979
01:57:10,360 --> 01:57:13,480
couldn't actually you know what we're never doing flush again because we

980
01:57:14,600 --> 01:57:22,840
right about time go I swear this game loves trolling like it genuinely loves trolling

981
01:57:23,400 --> 01:57:28,360
okay we got 12 that's good

982
01:57:30,280 --> 01:57:35,160
played cards with suit gives a fucking three plus no one consumable slot

983
01:57:35,160 --> 01:57:41,160
this is specific I'll show you my consumable slot I'll have you know adds double the rank

984
01:57:42,120 --> 01:57:48,040
uh pick that up and go for spade flush spade flush okay

985
01:57:48,040 --> 01:57:54,840
okay whatever we can say because I'm too dumb to figure out how the freaking flushes work

986
01:57:55,480 --> 01:57:59,480
the only thing I'll be flushing is myself down the toilet because I remember what I'm playing

987
01:58:03,000 --> 01:58:07,640
uh actually good hello actually good hello hello hello hello

988
01:58:09,720 --> 01:58:13,880
hello actually good okay then what are you

989
01:58:14,840 --> 01:58:20,280
all right as much as you want to find the arena packs and convert the space as much as possible

990
01:58:20,280 --> 01:58:25,960
literally wow are you oh a tarot card when destroyed

991
01:58:28,680 --> 01:58:29,480
I'm tempted

992
01:58:32,520 --> 01:58:38,120
I'm tempted I think the tarot gamble use that and convert it to a spade

993
01:58:38,360 --> 01:58:44,920
yeah I know exactly one consumable slot this thing up here

994
01:58:47,400 --> 01:58:50,760
I mean do I need it not really

995
01:58:53,960 --> 01:59:01,880
maybe if I accidentally redeem the um not the hyrule fan the one that gives to right spade

996
01:59:02,200 --> 01:59:08,120
and a spade looks like this yeah goodbye everything

997
01:59:10,120 --> 01:59:16,120
goodbye everything goodbye everything goodbye everything I want a spade card

998
01:59:16,920 --> 01:59:24,120
spade and spade yeah goodbye okay one two three four five let's go

999
01:59:24,200 --> 01:59:35,400
not bad but we are gonna need some planetarium upgrades because it's not

1000
01:59:36,840 --> 01:59:41,560
wait wait wait wait I had this splash card in another run is this not op is anything

1001
01:59:44,120 --> 01:59:48,680
is this not op is anything splash isn't great on flush though

1002
01:59:49,640 --> 01:59:58,600
oh no say it's not true hold on hold on say it's not true not good with a flush build

1003
01:59:58,600 --> 02:00:03,080
no how fucking how many times have you guys played this game how do you move so well

1004
02:00:04,200 --> 02:00:12,360
um right okay spade a face card a flush and then I can sell that when I panic

1005
02:00:12,920 --> 02:00:19,000
actually what's ahead of me playing cards played against with that air debuff that's fine

1006
02:00:19,560 --> 02:00:23,560
I I'm gonna be honest I don't think this is a winning run I've maxed out a deck in this game

1007
02:00:23,560 --> 02:00:29,080
and all difficult okay now far too much never played it I have like 60 plus hours that's decent

1008
02:00:30,120 --> 02:00:37,080
you gotta start putting face uh face cards yes that will be very nice

1009
02:00:37,800 --> 02:00:45,320
right my lovely spade you're not spade you're not spade you're spade you're not you're not you are

1010
02:00:46,360 --> 02:00:46,840
goodbye

1011
02:00:53,960 --> 02:00:55,640
can I just do that though

1012
02:00:58,920 --> 02:01:03,880
I know it's not a face card but I think it gives me enough

1013
02:01:04,840 --> 02:01:07,080
hold on let's test it how much does it give me

1014
02:01:09,240 --> 02:01:13,880
oh no oh no that's actually not good

1015
02:01:18,760 --> 02:01:24,680
sorry buy suit yes sorry I said I was gonna do that and then I'm not doing that okay so

1016
02:01:26,680 --> 02:01:29,000
I guess we're better going for clubs now

1017
02:01:29,640 --> 02:01:37,400
I said we're better going for cut loves now thank you

1018
02:01:39,880 --> 02:01:43,320
okay uh I will be admit I don't think I'm that confident

1019
02:01:46,360 --> 02:01:52,120
we have such high economy but we have nothing decent to spend it on right what are you

1020
02:01:53,160 --> 02:01:58,680
15 plus multi not times plus because there's a difference if you didn't know like don't

1021
02:01:58,680 --> 02:02:03,800
worry if you're new to the game don't be embarrassed if you're learning but you know some

1022
02:02:03,800 --> 02:02:10,440
some classic noobs don't know the difference between plus 15 and times multipliers there's

1023
02:02:10,440 --> 02:02:18,360
such goofy cubers you know right what are you a flat four multiplier you're just plus four you're

1024
02:02:18,440 --> 02:02:19,560
not times four though

1025
02:02:25,080 --> 02:02:26,440
I don't think we've won this run

1026
02:02:28,760 --> 02:02:34,120
so goofy I know it's okay you don't need to be embarrassed though like it happens

1027
02:02:34,120 --> 02:02:37,640
create a copy of a joker destroys all other jokers oh

1028
02:02:38,440 --> 02:02:40,440
oh

1029
02:02:46,040 --> 02:02:50,600
converse all cards in hand to a single random suit

1030
02:02:54,360 --> 02:02:58,200
there's too many clubs here to sacrifice into something else

1031
02:02:59,320 --> 02:03:01,560
gamble or do you want me to gamble it

1032
02:03:02,200 --> 02:03:05,000
fuck it

1033
02:03:08,360 --> 02:03:11,640
wait is that the right one was that the right one I didn't see it

1034
02:03:14,520 --> 02:03:18,360
oh my god it was the right one

1035
02:03:20,600 --> 02:03:27,640
wait it wasn't wait oh it wasn't it was club sorry they're both the same color so I can hardly see

1036
02:03:27,720 --> 02:03:33,720
the difference oh sorry I get confused between these symbols I feel like they're so similar

1037
02:03:33,720 --> 02:03:38,360
because they both have three points on them like do you know what I mean like point point point

1038
02:03:38,360 --> 02:03:44,440
flat point point point flat like they're the same thing I don't know if that sounds silly but

1039
02:03:44,440 --> 02:03:49,000
they're the same they're different but the same turn on high contrast mode you don't have to tell

1040
02:03:49,000 --> 02:04:00,600
me twice setting and before this is gonna be like so obvious now someone tears okay basically just

1041
02:04:00,600 --> 02:04:09,640
run in black suit flush now okay I mean I might as well just add a random freaking thing yeah

1042
02:04:09,640 --> 02:04:12,600
sure it's not gonna over discard it yeah

1043
02:04:16,920 --> 02:04:23,800
I'm needing I'm needing something better than what we've got I don't I do not believe I'm sorry I don't

1044
02:04:23,800 --> 02:04:32,840
believe I'm so oh it's blue abadi abadi right we have more blues than oh wait so yeah no already

1045
02:04:33,560 --> 02:04:41,000
I don't actually want to discard these too much though ah I don't like this run

1046
02:04:44,920 --> 02:04:46,440
I don't like this run at all

1047
02:04:51,240 --> 02:04:56,200
okay that was incredibly lucky because now we're gonna try and get spades one

1048
02:04:56,200 --> 02:05:02,760
which we are very close to getting a spade flush oh but I don't like this

1049
02:05:04,520 --> 02:05:10,120
discard creates a turret when discarded that's what I want that's what I want to see baby what

1055
02:05:45,640 --> 02:05:48,360
there's actually quite a lot clubs right let's just

1056
02:05:50,680 --> 02:05:55,560
let's just throw everything into the wind what are you enhances multi-card

1057
02:05:56,760 --> 02:05:59,240
unbelievably we actually did it

1058
02:06:01,320 --> 02:06:04,600
and oh wow it removed their debuff as well how interesting

1059
02:06:06,840 --> 02:06:13,800
well that was considerable that Empress came in clutch I think we're gonna have to definitely

1060
02:06:13,800 --> 02:06:20,120
utilize turret cards a bit more re-rolls cost two bucks less well that's rubbish uh no that's rubbish

1061
02:06:21,400 --> 02:06:23,480
we are we are out here

1062
02:06:27,000 --> 02:06:32,040

1063
02:06:34,200 --> 02:06:39,320
a straight flush is the best we got like didn't even need Luke Kador I don't know

you played them earlier that's why they're except okay

1066
02:06:49,800 --> 02:06:55,800
you need jipper or no straight flush is still technically a flush literally none of these options

1067
02:06:55,800 --> 02:07:03,480
right you I don't want you anymore you don't do anything what's the blind anyway

02:07:47,800 --> 02:07:50,280
I don't know if I should buy that and just burn through

1076
02:07:51,240 --> 02:07:54,840

1106
02:12:00,440 --> 02:12:13,800

1107
02:12:20,360 --> 02:12:26,840

1108
02:12:27,400 --> 02:12:32,520

1109
02:12:36,040 --> 02:12:41,160
wow please let me level up flush this is awful

1110
02:12:43,000 --> 02:12:48,040
re-triggered re-triggers all cards played for the next 10 hands

1111
02:12:48,440 --> 02:12:55,400
man I can't take this shit no more we're freaking

1112
02:12:57,880 --> 02:13:01,560
due to your selling the dude early the boss's auntie still applies

1113
02:13:03,400 --> 02:13:09,240
no flush and only log you just unlabeled flush I mean it's free

1114
02:13:18,200 --> 02:13:31,640
this is the worst I think we've ever had flush finally took you long enough to show up don't

1115
02:13:31,640 --> 02:13:38,040
be shy to show up again I'm gonna need a permanent hand if we want to even have a slim chance of

1116
02:13:38,040 --> 02:13:46,360
winning right who is my most I've got clubs give me more club and club club money or club

1117
02:13:46,360 --> 02:13:51,960
sitting in the hand if it sits in the hand it's a lot more valuable

1118
02:13:53,640 --> 02:14:00,360
we're just splashed it's splash it's splash terrible pick up the voucher it's basically

1119
02:14:00,360 --> 02:14:06,680
a lifeline yes I actually agree uh do we want oh my god sorry if I go bug bite on my leg

1120
02:14:06,760 --> 02:14:08,680
refling what if you just bit me

1121
02:14:10,360 --> 02:14:15,000
reflames did one of you just bite me on my juicy thighs what's going on

1122
02:14:18,120 --> 02:14:23,880
all right okay splash does nothing sorry splash is good if your hand doesn't have less than five

1123
02:14:23,880 --> 02:14:29,560
cards okay it was me no I thought I literally just thought bug bite that's probably the only

1124
02:14:29,560 --> 02:14:34,280
scary thing no fuck off I don't believe it's gonna be any good Ardua

1125
02:14:36,920 --> 02:14:39,320
oh my god I think I'm gonna have to double skip

1126
02:14:42,040 --> 02:14:48,680
I need I'm like struggling to win but if I can have three hands in a round without having to discard

1127
02:14:50,840 --> 02:14:55,480
oh fuck it fuck it we're we're hardly gonna win so let's just go bigger go home

1128
02:14:55,480 --> 02:14:57,480
um

1129
02:14:59,000 --> 02:15:05,880
gee willikers I wonder what that card is hmm it's a mystery well good luck I sure hope I don't mess

1130
02:15:05,880 --> 02:15:10,600
this one up okay I love sorting by suit okay

1131
02:15:13,960 --> 02:15:14,280
okay

1132
02:15:17,080 --> 02:15:21,640
there's so little hearts in the deck you guys are not worth having around

1133
02:15:22,440 --> 02:15:31,320
diamonds again you're rare but we're only one off oh I wonder what that one is

1134
02:15:32,360 --> 02:15:38,600
chucks the game almost got me I don't think I'm gonna make it maybe

1135
02:15:40,680 --> 02:15:43,480
right if I hold you in my hand I'll hold you

1136
02:15:52,200 --> 02:15:56,680
oh wow I actually did it holy crap that paid off I don't know how about I did

1137
02:15:57,640 --> 02:15:59,160
okay right what is my joker

1138
02:16:03,960 --> 02:16:09,480
wait hold on copies the joker ability to the right hold on hold on hold on hold on

1139
02:16:12,840 --> 02:16:15,320
right you're about to perish anyway

1140
02:16:21,960 --> 02:16:28,840
what do you do speed okay yeah blueprint but with what

1141
02:16:33,320 --> 02:16:39,080
I think blueprint and then joker and then get rid of photograph

1142
02:16:40,280 --> 02:16:43,560
and that's gonna expire naturally which is fine

1143
02:16:43,560 --> 02:16:51,320
so get rid of joker because he only does it once

1144
02:16:53,480 --> 02:16:59,560
first played face card gives the times two multi win scoring I get that it's big but

1145
02:17:04,280 --> 02:17:10,600
yeah just get rid of photograph okay sell you copies the ability the joker to the right so buy

1146
02:17:10,600 --> 02:17:22,680
you put you here and then sell spritz because it's gonna expire anyway I understand I just get rid

1147
02:17:22,680 --> 02:17:32,360
of straight joker um what crafty joker you want rid of him it is only 80 chips if it's a flush

1148
02:17:33,320 --> 02:17:42,120
yeah no I'm um what do I need to sacrifice I feel like that's gonna expire so there's no

1149
02:17:42,120 --> 02:17:43,320
point in keeping it around

1150
02:17:47,480 --> 02:17:49,320
mmm the 80 chips

1151
02:17:53,160 --> 02:17:59,880
I feel like you're doing nothing bro I do right so copies the ability to the right and it's compatible

1152
02:17:59,880 --> 02:18:10,920
so it's giving me 15 multi plus 10 multi for an extra 25 multi flush isn't worth it yeah

1153
02:18:12,600 --> 02:18:20,840
have blueprint next to seltzer for now okay I will agree with that and then when it perishes

1154
02:18:21,720 --> 02:18:31,960
we will move it in front of him rip chips stop have a mess up please give me joker oh my god this

1155
02:18:31,960 --> 02:18:32,760
game hates me

1156
02:18:39,000 --> 02:18:43,640
none of these are useful for me right now unfortunately well I'll go with planet earth

1157
02:18:43,640 --> 02:18:49,800
because why not right we're gonna do playing card because I want to keep adding to my clubs

1158
02:18:49,800 --> 02:18:50,600
basically

1159
02:18:55,800 --> 02:19:02,520
yes please get in that it so we're 22 clubs 18 space only 10 hearts and 10 diamonds

1160
02:19:03,240 --> 02:19:10,600
definitely want to start getting tarot cards that override these hearts and diamonds would be best

1161
02:19:10,680 --> 02:19:11,320
honestly

1162
02:19:15,560 --> 02:19:19,000
what do you do no fuck off you rubbish offer

1163
02:19:19,800 --> 02:19:23,160
whoa okay you you you you you go

1164
02:19:33,240 --> 02:19:38,920
that was a lot of movement for me not comprehending create a tarot card when discarded

1165
02:19:39,160 --> 02:19:47,000
okay so diamonds and hearts you're out because you guys I don't have enough of you what do you do

1166
02:19:47,640 --> 02:19:54,440
enhances something into a steel card I mean sure just sit right there I doesn't really matter

1167
02:19:55,880 --> 02:19:58,120
like I can still get a value out of it than I

1168
02:20:00,120 --> 02:20:04,920
oh wait I put it should have put it on a lower one sorry sorry sorry it's fine it's fine it's fine

1169
02:20:04,920 --> 02:20:11,240
okay okay okay okay okay maybe we've recovered a little bit if we can get a few jippers to get

1170
02:20:11,240 --> 02:20:14,040
more stupor uh

1171
02:20:18,280 --> 02:20:21,880
I know I should try and keep economy I know

1172
02:20:24,360 --> 02:20:31,640
I know right please jipper is all I ask thank god and it is a flush all the same color

1173
02:20:32,520 --> 02:20:38,760
it's all the same color flush it down the toilet okay and then we're gonna add

1174
02:20:39,400 --> 02:20:44,680
uh another club from this pack that we're a hundred percent gonna get

1175
02:20:50,280 --> 02:20:57,240
oh no I mean the odds of a the tarot card is so valuable though I know that gives 50 chips

1176
02:21:02,280 --> 02:21:05,320
hmm what do you say

1177
02:21:07,160 --> 02:21:12,840
DNA can help you make some face cut boil is a good one because you want to play the clubs I know

1178
02:21:13,800 --> 02:21:16,600
the tarot card might just save my arse cheeks you're right

1179
02:21:19,320 --> 02:21:25,240
can I see if I wait oh right okay now uh if first hand on round only has one card

1180
02:21:25,240 --> 02:21:30,120
our dependent copy to deck and draw it that's a joker

1181
02:21:31,880 --> 02:21:36,280
another time another time we'll come back to you we'll come back to you another time right you

1182
02:21:36,280 --> 02:21:42,920
enhance two cards into a lucky card I mean I can do that for literally anyone sorry I keep

1183
02:21:42,920 --> 02:21:51,720
forgetting it's clubs blue okay so we can get rid of these because we can't have them

1184
02:21:53,000 --> 02:21:55,000
okay that was lucky ish

1185
02:21:58,360 --> 02:22:02,520
I definitely want to eliminate any hearts and diamonds at this point

1186
02:22:02,520 --> 02:22:08,600
if I can get a tarot card to bless us spritzer little spritzers getting a bit weak now

1187
02:22:09,560 --> 02:22:13,000
right one two three four five what do you do

1188
02:22:15,160 --> 02:22:20,360
I'll keep you for now I'll see if my lucky cards pop off

1189
02:22:25,640 --> 02:22:27,560
okay could be worse

1190
02:22:29,240 --> 02:22:36,520
create a tarot card when discarded okay against my best interest what do you do

1191
02:22:37,240 --> 02:22:38,440
say

1192
02:22:40,760 --> 02:22:45,960

1194
02:22:53,880 --> 02:22:57,640

1195
02:22:58,040 --> 02:23:07,800

1196
02:23:08,600 --> 02:23:14,520

I am being troll and that's okay jupiter I call upon you

1200
02:23:39,800 --> 02:23:46,600
no thank goodness gravy I am desperate I am on my hands and knees jupiter what are we looking at

1201
02:23:46,600 --> 02:23:49,640
not full house flush

1202
02:23:56,440 --> 02:24:03,080
oh we're literally have more in full house I can do it again right sure straight three of a cane

1203
02:24:03,080 --> 02:24:12,840
straight flush is the best I got next round I don't have the economy to be messing around how many

1204
02:24:13,880 --> 02:24:15,640
oh no he's about to break

1205
02:24:16,040 --> 02:24:26,760
full house is giving more than flush honestly because it's cheeky bad pause

1206
02:24:28,840 --> 02:24:30,120
yes it's just worth more

1207
02:24:34,360 --> 02:24:39,640
lose a dollar per car plate that's fine our economy's bad anyway does it mean oh we're

1208
02:24:39,640 --> 02:24:42,760
gonna keep that in hand hopefully one two three four five go

1209
02:24:46,600 --> 02:24:53,320
I took five bucks from me am I gonna go in debt I thought this was a fantasy game why is

1213
02:25:18,920 --> 02:25:25,560
so blueprint abstract and then if I play a face card and if I play a spade it's just

1214
02:25:26,120 --> 02:25:32,280
can we play cards when we run out of money I don't know I'm going to discard the tarot

1215

multiplier here we go right 10 10 9 7 5 go have fun do something

1219
02:26:07,400 --> 02:26:22,600
I don't like that no the chances of me rolling another club is high I'm sorry I'm going to

1220
02:26:22,600 --> 02:26:29,640
have to sacrifice the ace I'm sorry I have to sacrifice the ace I didn't want to

1232
02:27:45,640 --> 02:27:51,480
deck that make your hearts and diamonds count as one suit the same for cotton space oh okay

1233

1234
02:27:58,920 --> 02:28:05,000
all look too hard let's just keep doing one extra discard we just need a joker to be kind to us okay

1235
02:28:08,440 --> 02:28:15,960

oh and there's the king yeah yeah yeah up my arse what does it say yeah um

1240
02:28:53,240 --> 02:28:56,680
I don't have a particularly high chance of rolling a flush

1241
02:29:01,000 --> 02:29:05,080
but might as well might as well go for it

1242
02:29:05,160 --> 02:29:14,120
I see this game see this game how dare this game make me so addicted to it but absolutely

1243
02:29:14,120 --> 02:29:22,120
clueless on what to do honestly right I can't believe I'm actually doing maths in a freaking

1249
02:29:56,200 --> 02:30:06,600
right do we spend right we're only going to get one dollar interest anyway so we might as well go

1250
02:30:06,600 --> 02:30:15,880
for it uncommon uncommon and they're both common why because why wouldn't they be I'm losing it when

if mmm because you got free jokers you could just sell them I don't

1258
02:31:19,080 --> 02:31:27,480
if I get more rare that 1.5 gets out of control pretty quickly right what's the deal

1259
02:31:30,920 --> 02:31:40,360
okay this stays so if I keep my economy

1260
02:31:42,760 --> 02:31:48,360

1350
02:42:23,880 --> 02:42:25,720
go for full house yeah

1351
02:42:28,520 --> 02:42:36,360
that's bizarre and it's uncommon right so you finally compliment you you mean bam

1352
02:42:38,200 --> 02:42:44,280
and then what you two are like card and then what are you just a random thing and you're random as well

1353
02:42:47,400 --> 02:42:51,240
you need to be at the end though so it's like active and then you

1354
02:42:52,680 --> 02:42:54,600
sell two pairs and buy a new joker

1355
02:42:54,760 --> 02:43:01,480
sell two pair and buy a new joker and now sell the first joker

1356
02:43:03,320 --> 02:43:04,440
Gigi should be at the end

1357
02:43:07,960 --> 02:43:14,760
why sell two pair yeah because my triple will get counted in a two pair if I do full house angle as well

1358
02:43:14,920 --> 02:43:25,320
fill house will trigger both of those yes that I re-roll to get a multi activity

1359
02:43:28,120 --> 02:43:31,880
I mean one re-roll can't hurt yeah he literally got it well

1360
02:43:33,880 --> 02:43:37,720
four of a cane no hi hi no

1361
02:43:38,360 --> 02:43:44,600
um yeah this is another rough looking one I'm gonna be honest

1362
02:43:48,680 --> 02:43:51,480
oh wait did I just fuck up did I just fuck up

1363
02:43:57,160 --> 02:44:04,040
I hope I didn't mess up no okay right so you're gonna activate when a double goes

1364
02:44:04,040 --> 02:44:06,760
you are gonna help you

1365
02:44:10,520 --> 02:44:16,040
I see aces so get rid of all of this oh I'm so close to a flush

1366
02:44:18,840 --> 02:44:22,520
honestly four of a kind apart you have to sell some jokers in New York yeah

1367
02:44:24,840 --> 02:44:31,160
right two pair three of a kind so I need a right I need to fill house

1368
02:44:32,120 --> 02:44:36,920
how am I so proud of this girl can I get a king or an ace please

1369
02:44:45,160 --> 02:44:46,760
I'm just gonna have to play something

1370
02:44:48,360 --> 02:44:52,200
two pair go for it and the ace should trigger on that at least

1371
02:44:52,600 --> 02:45:03,880
what do you do oh piss it's always too late increases the rank of up to two cards by one

1372
02:45:06,760 --> 02:45:14,600
right so I'm gonna make some nine some tens I know I suck you don't have to tell me

1373
02:45:15,560 --> 02:45:24,040
it's silly compare up to three selective cards to clubs sure let's make everything clubs

1374
02:45:24,040 --> 02:45:29,400
like it makes a difference to this point I can do a flush if I want to

1375
02:45:30,840 --> 02:45:36,360
uh just do two pairs again for how strong are you better than giving to me I'm getting

1376
02:45:36,360 --> 02:45:42,840
rolled and is this deck is like so hard for no reason hold on I want a double

1377
02:45:49,000 --> 02:46:00,600
there's more three four and six and eight can go three four six and eight can go and then I can get

1378
02:46:07,320 --> 02:46:14,040
I know for a fact I'm reading these odds correctly and being trolled out the wazoo

1379
02:46:18,360 --> 02:46:24,200
I know I am reading these correctly and can get a full house I am being trolled so hard

1380
02:46:24,200 --> 02:46:32,120
with odds right now holy holy holy holy holy holy right eight can get to fuck

1381
02:46:32,520 --> 02:46:34,920
six can get to fuck

1382
02:46:38,200 --> 02:46:41,640
I can I'm getting trolled so bad looking at the odds honestly

1383
02:46:45,880 --> 02:46:50,600
well where are you when your room begins add a random playing card with a random

1384
02:46:50,600 --> 02:46:58,920
feel to your hand well that's kind of cool four of a kind I don't really have that choose a joker

1385
02:47:02,440 --> 02:47:04,920
well it's gonna have to be better than anything I've got on my persons

1386
02:47:09,400 --> 02:47:11,320
every played card counts in scoring

1387
02:47:13,240 --> 02:47:19,960
gain 15 chips if it's a straight times four multi if played hand contains four of a kind

1388
02:47:19,960 --> 02:47:29,160
that's so rare I don't have any played it it's an uncommon the rare you want splash

1389
02:47:29,160 --> 02:47:35,240
is splash good with my current thing baseball jokers like having a laugh at me just sell them

1390
02:47:41,640 --> 02:47:50,280
no wait splash is bad oh the one in the shop is uncommon my apologies okay just skip these

1391
02:47:50,680 --> 02:48:03,400
I don't think I'm going to get rid of what eight chips or 12 plus

1392
02:48:11,080 --> 02:48:17,880
what one sell the two of a kind pair two of a kind okay I'll take your advice

1393
02:48:18,440 --> 02:48:24,040
and you come right so now you are giving me multiplier for that as well when round begins

1394
02:48:24,040 --> 02:48:32,280
add a random playing card with a random seal in your hand or or a seal in in your hand more likely

1395
02:48:32,280 --> 02:48:41,000
than you think okay add a playing card make it good make it a tarot or something oh right

1396
02:48:41,080 --> 02:48:47,400
we roll so I can boost him boom right what do you do a joker a tarot a planet and a

1397
02:48:47,400 --> 02:48:54,760
spectral card may appear multiple times what does that mean this joker gains three plus

1398
02:48:54,760 --> 02:48:59,640
chips paired discarded club card new card with a seal

1399
02:49:03,400 --> 02:49:10,120
two parts is in the Fibonacci sequence he's better than scholar is he I mean I'll take

1400
02:49:10,120 --> 02:49:16,840
him he's uncommon so he's gonna hit with him fuck you scholar and you come you

1401
02:49:19,560 --> 02:49:27,640
we now have 1.5345 and then six times six multiplier because of all these guys

1402
02:49:28,840 --> 02:49:32,680
surely that's how it works surely I'm gonna re-roll again to give him a little boost

1403
02:49:33,640 --> 02:49:40,440
I know I shouldn't but each played queen of diamond gives a two times malt that's a bit much

1404
02:49:41,880 --> 02:49:46,680
I mean you could get like multiple of the baseball jokers yeah I feel like a bit of that

1405
02:49:48,200 --> 02:49:51,640
that was like a dog and not a seal or or wait moose

1406
02:49:55,720 --> 02:50:01,640
am I good pup for you so many uncommon literally that's uncommon as well

1407
02:50:03,560 --> 02:50:11,160
that one's far too specific though yeah what do you mean my seal sound isn't good or

1408
02:50:11,160 --> 02:50:19,720
or you know you you buy upgrade high card by three levels well I'm not playing high far

1409
02:50:20,440 --> 02:50:28,120
first hand is drawn face down that's fine well why did you shake when discarded

1410
02:50:28,120 --> 02:50:38,200
I've got three discarded not discard me I don't really want to discard these either

1411
02:50:41,400 --> 02:50:44,680
you're always good to stand straight right discard for attire

1412
02:50:46,280 --> 02:50:55,320
the lovers into a wild card oh my god it's so wild why is the card wild we'll never know

1413
02:50:55,320 --> 02:50:57,320
I want to keep that 10 because of that the thing

1414
02:50:59,000 --> 02:51:03,560
uh what the fuck am I supposed to play three of a kind

1415
02:51:11,560 --> 02:51:15,560
okay

1416
02:51:16,120 --> 02:51:23,560
three of a kind speed and then holy shit that's it that's all I can do

1417
02:51:25,800 --> 02:51:34,200
I mean it did something something was popping off I don't I don't exactly know what but it was

1418
02:51:34,200 --> 02:51:40,360
pop a lock and choose playing cards or choose playing cards

1419
02:51:44,040 --> 02:51:50,120
cool house I live for the wild I do love a dapper moustache

1420
02:51:50,520 --> 02:51:54,680
noodles yes you are a good little seaweed I love that fucking nickname

1421
02:51:54,680 --> 02:51:59,080
let's just get a little seaweed tell you I'm a little seaweed I'll be flowing in the water

1422
02:51:59,080 --> 02:52:01,960
sell the first joker and reroll for an uncommon really

1423
02:52:06,760 --> 02:52:12,920
fuck it give me an uncommon shit

1424
02:52:13,240 --> 02:52:24,120
I would have to completely change up my plan I think it's too late to change a strategy like that

1425
02:52:29,560 --> 02:52:31,720
is it too late for fancy pants

1426
02:52:34,520 --> 02:52:39,240
it's trusors nope it's worth it trusors works with a full house

1427
02:52:39,320 --> 02:52:47,720
right uncommon uncommon uncommon and I can't get rid of that guy because he lets me hold

1428
02:52:47,720 --> 02:52:52,520
the or everyone um

1429
02:52:56,760 --> 02:52:59,160
put the pants first sorry I always forget that part

1430
02:52:59,720 --> 02:53:09,960
uh 7.5 on uncommon isn't bad maybe if we can swap to the two pair angle it's not too bad I

1431
02:53:11,400 --> 02:53:12,120
I'm gonna buy

1432
02:53:14,600 --> 02:53:15,800
right what are we looking at

1433
02:53:20,200 --> 02:53:21,640
chance to win money though

1434
02:53:22,440 --> 02:53:30,920
chance to win money or double the point I feel like money because when we reroll

1435
02:53:30,920 --> 02:53:37,080
this little guy's getting stronger every time we're gonna next round it first hand is drawn

1436
02:53:37,080 --> 02:53:46,360
face down that's fine uh unless that one isn't so we know by rank that we've got pretty low batch

1437
02:53:46,360 --> 02:53:52,440
of cards I have four attempts to get 10k

1438
02:53:54,920 --> 02:54:00,600
hmm don't buy so many cards a slung deck is more reliable

1439
02:54:06,280 --> 02:54:12,520
wait no fuck it hey we got a double in there

1440
02:54:13,320 --> 02:54:16,680

1441
02:54:26,120 --> 02:54:26,920
I've done it now

1442
02:54:33,000 --> 02:54:34,200
I've done it now

1443
02:54:34,520 --> 02:54:44,120

full house was also an option was it okay no was it full house oh yeah yeah yeah

1458
02:56:24,840 --> 02:56:31,000
full house would activate two pair anyway okay another uncapped well we can't really

1459
02:56:31,000 --> 02:56:36,280
change up anything uh sell this card to create a free double card I don't know what that is

1460
02:56:37,240 --> 02:56:40,280
uh no I need the rounds when blind is like no

1461
02:56:41,000 --> 02:56:46,120
turret card oh please oh please what's two pair I've forgotten

1462
02:56:48,200 --> 02:56:54,200
oh Uranus in you come we're doing two pair strategy we might be able to do it in time

1463
02:56:55,960 --> 02:57:06,520
to save the run to swap now would I need delete spades that I don't think anything happens spades

1464
02:57:06,520 --> 02:57:15,800
maybe turn turn stuff into spades fuck it turn stuff into spades sure everything comes spades

1465
02:57:19,880 --> 02:57:25,800
we're gonna reroll to increase our little buddy there add one stone to deck when blind is selected

1466
02:57:25,800 --> 02:57:29,800
one and two chance to create a turret card when any booster pack is open

1467
02:57:29,800 --> 02:57:39,960
wow that seems pretty OP but I would lose out on something

1468
02:57:44,120 --> 02:57:50,920
yeah I would lose out on a multiplier it's good at the start it's too late now okay agreed agreed

1469
02:57:50,920 --> 02:57:58,760
um I'm gonna reroll no I'm not I'm gonna go next shit okay what are you initial cards and

1513
03:03:26,280 --> 03:03:34,600
then keep the space this isn't actually a very good discard range

1514
03:03:35,400 --> 03:03:38,600
you need to keep and not use the other five delete the other lows

1515
03:03:40,280 --> 03:03:41,400

1612
03:15:01,800 --> 03:15:05,320
okay okay i'm satisfied next round let's go

1613
03:15:06,040 --> 03:15:08,280
discard two random cards every time you play a

1614
03:15:11,160 --> 03:15:13,240
we are gonna go full house if that's the case

1615
03:15:15,960 --> 03:15:16,760
what do you do

1616
03:15:17,000 --> 03:15:22,360
well let's just use the el diablo

1617
03:15:25,000 --> 03:15:30,040
uh right one two three four five because it's going to throw away something at random

1618
03:15:30,840 --> 03:15:33,800
i'm just going for it the lover's card

1619
03:15:36,680 --> 03:15:41,160
yeah that looks about right that i threw away our doubles of either end

1620
03:15:42,120 --> 03:15:52,280
oh we won wait i believe i believe i unironically believe hold on

1621
03:15:55,880 --> 03:15:59,560
i'm only gonna buy this because again it levels up our spectral joker

1622
03:16:00,280 --> 03:16:06,360
i believe wait we are like wrecking and decking hold on three of a kind straight flush or straight

1623
03:16:06,760 --> 03:16:11,320
three of a kindle yeah yeah three of a kind sure yeah even though it's supposed to be doubles

1624
03:16:13,320 --> 03:16:18,200
give me hermit right now give me my money back okay no close enough three of a kind

1625
03:16:18,200 --> 03:16:23,000
i mean this is more valuable because it levels up this guy

1626
03:16:25,720 --> 03:16:32,680
and then we'll reroll as an as the number of times poker hands has been played to this

1627
03:16:32,680 --> 03:16:38,840
run to the multiplier the multiplier sorry that's really getting stuck i actually starting to believe

1628
03:16:40,040 --> 03:16:45,480
what's the boss blind uh one in seven cards get faced down

1631
03:17:03,720 --> 03:17:08,120
close to that three times which we skipped on and he gives us a 1.5 on top of him

1632
03:17:09,560 --> 03:17:15,080
i believe i believe call me justin beaver because i believe

1633
