Raise the tension. Raise the tension. Any tension. How you just literally took my little boost thing.

35:04.800 --> 35:08.920
That could have been make or break. And what do you, how do I get repeat?

35:09.880 --> 35:11.880
Up my arse. Honestly.

35:12.520 --> 35:16.240
Honestly. This is strong. What are you, oh my god.

35:18.640 --> 35:22.800
Okay, this is why I need to copy the reflins because you guys have actually played this game before.

35:23.040 --> 35:28.080
What? We're literally sidewall drifting. Can I get the, the, the, the, no!

35:29.920 --> 35:31.920
You took my eye arm!

35:33.600 --> 35:41.600
Refling! Whoever did the lightning bolt, I'm actually sleep paralysis and I'm 12th place! No!

35:43.600 --> 35:48.960
At Fanun Mama. Shame I can't join the race myself since I don't have Mario Kart.

35:48.960 --> 35:52.320
I didn't. But I'm wholly content watching you tear up the track.

35:52.880 --> 35:57.040
You've got this. Tear up the track? Are you kidding me? This is so bad.

35:58.160 --> 36:02.560
Why did I pick this game for a street sniping purpose? This is so bad.

36:11.360 --> 36:17.920
Right, let's do ace, ace outpost. Thank you, K-Dawn. K-Dawn, I'm saying it wrong.

36:17.920 --> 36:20.480
After you mommy, shame you can't join because of the Mario Kart.

36:20.480 --> 36:25.760
Don't buy it is my advice. It's fucking shite. It's so hard to play. It's not shite. It's just I'm shite.

36:26.480 --> 36:32.560
But I'm wholly content watching you tear up the track. Why are you hyping me up over lie?

36:34.560 --> 36:40.480
Why are you telling fibbers? You know, for a factory fling, I'm not tear it. The only thing I'm tearing

36:40.480 --> 36:45.280
is your freaking back door trying to get to that bros day. I'm sucking it. It's so bad like.

36:45.840 --> 36:52.400
Brov. How the a- Like, I'm not being funny. How is this not just like Mario Kart from DS?

36:52.400 --> 36:57.280
Why is this something else? What do you mean they have to keep evolving games in order to

36:57.280 --> 37:06.720
make them worthy of freaking selling? Like, Brov. I'm losing it. I think she needs the auto-steering.

37:06.720 --> 37:10.960
I do too. I'm not being funny, but I actually do. Like, I'm forgetting to steer.

37:11.680 --> 37:17.840
Okay. Right. I'm going to try hard, even though I've never played this freaking track before and

37:17.840 --> 37:29.280
I have no idea what's up ahead. Okay. Okay. Right. I've got a speedboot. Who's picked this map?

37:30.800 --> 37:37.360
Oh my god. Someone just went off the map. Oh no. That's a bit dangerous for me. I'm going to be

37:37.360 --> 37:41.680
honest. I didn't know I had to turn. I didn't know I had to turn. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

37:42.480 --> 37:49.600
Have I gone somewhere? I shouldn't be. I mean, would they code it in? Okay. Okay. Okay. Him with

37:49.600 --> 37:57.440
him with him. Hey. I'm trying hard. And I suck, even when I try hard. How is this possible? Be

37:57.440 --> 38:03.360
honest. Have you guys all played this game? Is this like a super popular game? I know that sounds

38:03.440 --> 38:12.720
so weird. Like, I'm sure it sounds weird to say it loud, but like, I just, I just, I fucking suck.

38:12.720 --> 38:19.280
I suck so badly. Like, I don't, I don't remember ever sucking so badly in a game before.

38:20.880 --> 38:24.640
Like normally like, oh, I get the hang of it. I comprehend what I'm supposed to do.

38:25.360 --> 38:27.360
This is just annihilation.

38:32.720 --> 38:36.320
Oh my god. That's funny. Sorry. That's actually funny.

38:37.360 --> 38:40.080
You've cheered me up because you're letting me in your prostate. I love you here.

38:42.080 --> 38:45.360
I might be the one getting annihilated, but no, it's time for you to bend over.

38:48.080 --> 38:50.480
I'm literally not mad anymore because I'm getting prostate.

38:50.480 --> 38:59.280
I suck. That is foul. Stop it. You shouldn't encourage me. Thank you, Kai, down to the super chat.

39:00.000 --> 39:07.440
That is terrible. Right. Oh, I'm going to let all steer. I'm literally, how can you do that if I'm

39:07.440 --> 39:15.360
spamming down the track? Sauce, but yous are cheating. Stop. I'm doing so well. And you keep

39:15.440 --> 39:22.240
putting your banana on the track. How am I 12th place again? I was literally 8th place like a

39:22.240 --> 39:30.880
moment ago. Oh my god. I don't even know if I'm going to make it. I need like a special, I literally

39:30.880 --> 39:40.880
did not finish. I know that. Fucking all I'm getting is one freaking point. This isn't even possible.

39:41.760 --> 39:46.560
When will you fricks learn? When you fricking fricks learn? Your ex is just complicated.

39:48.080 --> 39:54.160
Skill issue. It literally is a skill issue. It needs to lock back in, bro. The only lock

39:54.160 --> 39:59.120
I'm doing is putting one on your pee pee because I'm getting the disrespect I'm experiencing.

40:00.160 --> 40:06.160
I'm just picking maps at random. I thought you were a gamer. Oh, that comment always comes up.

40:06.880 --> 40:12.240
You're first to be R worded. That comment always comes up. I know you try to wind me up and it's

40:12.240 --> 40:18.640
working. That comment always comes up. Oh, you've played games before. So you're not MLG in every

40:18.640 --> 40:27.280
single game you ever play. You're first. Do you hear me? You are first. Oh, I hate this. I hate it.

40:27.280 --> 40:33.200
Right, let's go. Yoshi Valley. Oh, fuck you. I'm done.

40:34.880 --> 40:42.160
Right. This is impossible. I need, literally, I need to steer assist on because I'm so bad.

40:43.200 --> 40:49.280
And then everyone's gonna hate. Maybe I'll have, right, go. Now that's when I put on.

40:51.520 --> 40:56.560
Bro, so I put on a saying too late and then I'm too late and then I put on a saying too early

40:56.560 --> 41:04.000
and I'm saying too early. Why is everyone going this way? Wait, what kind of track is this?

41:04.960 --> 41:09.600
You can go multiple ways. Okay, hold on. Sorry, but the developer's kind of cool.

41:10.480 --> 41:15.600
That actually doesn't seem like that bad of an idea. Like it seems really fun and different.

41:16.480 --> 41:24.640
I'm kind of here for it. Hold on. Right, go. Oh no, everything's bendy though. I don't have

41:24.640 --> 41:31.600
like a straight. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Come on. Let me try hard. Like for

41:31.600 --> 41:38.880
one map, let me try. Why is there a random egg in the middle of the map? Stop flamethrowering.

41:40.240 --> 41:44.400
That's it. No fire v-tubers. Fire v-tubers banned for Gen 2. I'm not having it.

41:46.400 --> 41:50.720
What do you mean? Emmy technically can control fire. Yes, but that's because of the book. Okay,

41:50.800 --> 41:53.680
it's all about the book. Wait, Emmy, be nice to her. Okay, she tries her best.

41:54.320 --> 41:57.520
Right, fuck it. I'm going the right side. So I was, I'm going the right side. All right.

41:58.960 --> 42:05.280
Okay, OOM said go underneath. What? This is actually really creative. Sorry, but they

42:05.280 --> 42:09.520
actually did really well. Yeah, that's right. That's what you get with your green freaking thing.

42:09.520 --> 42:15.280
It's my way, ya bobag, honestly. Wait, hold on, hold on, hold on.

42:15.440 --> 42:23.520
Oh my God. Oh my God. Right, sorry, I can't. I need OOM to just kick in. Please, OOM. I can't

42:23.520 --> 42:30.080
believe I need a freaking child's game to OOM me in the right direction. Get out. No way,

42:30.080 --> 42:39.600
that just happened. Yeah, like, oh my God. Stop. There's ink and I'm getting tipped over. I literally

42:39.600 --> 42:49.120
can't even drive. Did you just do that for, I swear that was targeted. I swear that was targeted

42:49.120 --> 42:55.600
and that rifling legit was like, like, oh, there's mummy, I'm going for it. I swear that was, am I

42:55.600 --> 43:03.040
going crazy? That was targeted. What was the name? I'm actually coming to your house right now and

43:03.040 --> 43:09.440
getting your address. I'm writing it down. That is outrageous behaviour. I stream every single day.

43:09.440 --> 43:14.640
I have so much fun. I do all these free audios and this is what I freaking get. This is what I get.

43:15.920 --> 43:22.080
I fart in the wind. No, out my way right now. Out my way right now. No. Hey, it's dropping bombs!

43:22.080 --> 43:32.800
I was fourth place. Oh, I'm tenth again. Whoever dropped that bomb, fucking, your mom's a hoe.

43:32.800 --> 43:36.800
So as she actually was like, she can't even close them. Oh my God, I'm ninth place. I'll take it,

43:36.800 --> 43:41.040
right? That was a good attempt. I'm ninth place. I got eight points. I got nine, I got four points

43:41.040 --> 43:49.600
for that. So now I'm still second place. Oh yeah. After all that hard working effort, I'm still

43:49.600 --> 43:58.480
second place. Yippee. You whipped wrong type of ink on my bed. Thank you, Kaidon. Anonymous. How

43:58.480 --> 44:04.640
cute. Even mummy can have AC levels of brightness. When she's being a sore loser, head pass for trying.

44:05.360 --> 44:11.600
Fucking the thing's like, yeah, nice try. You are second place. Please, you suck. Take your frustrations

44:11.600 --> 44:16.480
out on me. Oh, it's already happening. Didn't you think I was snow? Right, we'll need to refresh the lobby

44:17.040 --> 44:23.200
and pray that we have some empathetic refunds that'll let me go ahead. You know you're out there.

44:28.080 --> 44:29.600
Are you squidding me right now?

44:30.800 --> 44:37.040
Lord of storms. Angry Scottish caught fish noises all the bit. Am I actually getting that angry?

44:38.080 --> 44:41.120
I don't remember. I don't really recall. Maybe I just like black it. Right,

44:41.760 --> 44:44.560
right. We need someone. Can I make a green toad?

44:46.960 --> 44:48.960
Why can't I make you green? Go green right now.

44:51.680 --> 44:55.680
Why are you blue? Wait, you aren't as fast as the other one?

44:56.880 --> 45:01.920
Watching you mold is the best thing ever. I'm actually, I don't know, that your next felt personal.

45:01.920 --> 45:08.000
Oops, sorry. Sorry if I scared anyone. I promise I'm having a good time for the most part.

45:08.960 --> 45:15.280
It's like, I'm enjoying myself. I get to play with you. Thank you, Jax and y'all, and thank

45:15.280 --> 45:20.800
Anonymous says, I can't wait for all that Scottish rage to go off real, real, real. Right, Roy.

45:23.040 --> 45:27.360
Right, Roy, surely you'll gain. Whoa, why are you so fast?

45:30.560 --> 45:37.360
Oh my God, we're almost max speed. Wait, who's max speed combo? Someone must have it. Oh my gosh.

45:37.440 --> 45:40.800
Right, ID. Kilo to

45:42.880 --> 45:52.320
Foxtrot for November. The fats are fast. Oh, that's a little bit of a,

45:54.080 --> 45:58.320
is that actually true? Is that the meta in the game that the bigger the person, the

45:58.320 --> 46:03.360
bigger they are, like the faster they are? Are you sweating right now?

46:03.440 --> 46:08.480
Gamer smack talk is when you know you're having fun. Just your mom's a whole. That's it. That's

46:08.480 --> 46:15.200
all I've got going for me. Tydon, I'll offer up myself. If you win this race, I can't win anything.

46:15.200 --> 46:27.920
I suck. Kilo to F alpha November. Oh, look at all my replays. Hi replays. One, two, three, four.

46:27.920 --> 46:34.000
Is that Shaggy? That third one from the right? One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight,

46:34.000 --> 46:42.880
nine, 10, 11. There's one more. And there's Hatsune Miku. Hatsune Miku. I'm thinking Miku, Miku,

46:44.480 --> 46:48.720
I'm thinking you. I'm coming in to take the 12th place. Are you going to switch?

46:50.560 --> 46:55.280
Are you going to switch soon? You're actually, wait, is there 12? One, two, three, four, five,

46:55.360 --> 46:59.200
six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11. Okay, there's one person. I've seen what's coming.

47:01.520 --> 47:05.440
Yeah, I've got the game. Oh my God. I didn't know you had the game. Right. Put in,

47:05.440 --> 47:16.880
right. Sin sisters getting the last spot. Kilo to Foxtrot for November. I wonder now,

47:16.880 --> 47:23.680
are we about to find out if Sin sisters as bad at this game as me or is she MLG pro? Hmm.

47:25.360 --> 47:30.800
Heavier classes are faster than harder to move when rammed, but have slow acceleration.

47:32.080 --> 47:44.480
Oh, I should go for acceleration and both shine. Oh, no. It's not going to go well for us. Is that

47:44.480 --> 47:50.880
one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11. Is she correct? We'll see. They are

47:50.880 --> 47:56.800
going to fight for that 12th place. Stop. I think we may actually be this entire next map is me

47:56.800 --> 48:00.800
going to be going, send, send, leave me alone, send, send, go the right, go away.

48:04.640 --> 48:10.560
This is a members only thing. Yeah. Anyone can join, but since coming in, you're not sin.

48:10.560 --> 48:18.560
What the fuck are you? Who the fuck are you? That's not sin. Is that you and your, that can't

48:18.560 --> 48:25.280
be your sin. That's not sin. There's no way. That's, is that your dad or something? What the

48:25.280 --> 48:37.200
fuck? Is that your dad's me? Right. Well, wait for her to type, but if someone's, no, I'm no,

48:37.200 --> 48:43.200
in your cheeky. Right. Is anyone, does anyone feel like sacrificing themselves so Sin can come

48:43.200 --> 48:47.600
into this lobby? We flings and shows all we, but can I kindly request that?

48:49.440 --> 48:54.480
Is anyone willing to sacrifice? There's, I need, I'll join next round. It's okay. Oh,

48:54.480 --> 48:59.680
no, no, no, there, there, there, look, look, look, look, look. The reflins are popping off. Come on,

48:59.680 --> 49:04.960
send, come on, come on, get in this fucking game. So at least I'm not last place. Surely you'll be

49:05.920 --> 49:14.400
last place. If I was in there, thank you reflings. Right, let's see Sin come in. Do you look like

49:16.800 --> 49:20.400
Is that you? Oh my God. Why are you so pretty? Is that you?

49:24.800 --> 49:28.560
Sin's gonna whopper. Why is your freaking thing so pretty?

49:28.880 --> 49:38.880
Okay. If that is you, she's greener. I'm not in. Oh, that's not you. All right. Okay, okay, okay.

49:41.280 --> 49:44.160
Oh, wait, wait, is your freaking thing booted up yet?

49:47.760 --> 49:53.920
I'm excited. Hold on. How'd that talk again? Let's wait for more players. What a shame.

49:54.480 --> 49:59.920
I'm using tilt control. Oh, I'm already tilted. So you don't need to tell me.

50:01.200 --> 50:05.520
I'll get you next time. Literally need to all the reflings unanimously.

50:08.000 --> 50:14.640
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, 11. Yeah, so Sin can get in. Sin's charging her switch.

50:16.400 --> 50:20.400
I got asked because I only saw the end of the Ring Fit stream, but you're all good now. Yeah,

50:20.400 --> 50:30.080
yeah, no, I passed out. And then that's how my body recovered. Next round, give Sin the code first.

50:32.000 --> 50:33.120
What is going on?

50:36.480 --> 50:39.680
And before you message me on, I'm in? Who are-

50:42.160 --> 50:43.760
I'm in last? Wait, who are you?

50:46.160 --> 50:49.040
One. That's you?

50:50.400 --> 50:56.320
Are you the red? I don't know. I picked Bowser. Are you the freaking red guy in the suit?

50:57.920 --> 51:04.880
On the right? Oh, did you just pick a random? Wait, press X and talk. Like, go like, goodnight.

51:06.560 --> 51:15.120
That must be you. Sin for strong! Okay, that's so cute. Right, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven,

51:15.200 --> 51:19.920
eight, nine, ten, 11, 12. Okay, we're ready. We're ready. Right, we know who to beat.

51:21.200 --> 51:27.840
We know who to go for. We know who to go for. Let's see if me and the thing is,

51:28.880 --> 51:34.240
I'll tell you the story when we play Elden Ring together, but you wouldn't believe it. But me and

51:34.240 --> 51:42.240
Sin used to be very, very good gamers on a very specific game. Right, let's say the airport. Speaking

51:42.240 --> 51:45.680
of modern warfare, Pop is on the airport terminal map.

51:49.680 --> 51:55.280
Why am I Boris Johnson? I didn't even know I'm the one who switched. Honestly.

51:57.440 --> 52:02.080
I don't know how VTubers play this game. This game is so hard for no reason.

52:05.040 --> 52:08.400
Okay, who's getting the pick? Who's getting the pick?

52:08.640 --> 52:14.560
Pinball map? It looks like pinball.

52:16.240 --> 52:19.440
Monka. Monka, Monka, Monka, Monka, Monka, Monka.

52:21.840 --> 52:28.000
Mumu Meadow is best map? Is that your opinion or is that fact right? Right, so my what? My acceleration

52:28.000 --> 52:35.040
is do-do, but my speed is good? I think I've completely messed up this choice. Right, let's connect.

52:36.000 --> 52:42.240
I got burned. What? No, you better not.

52:45.920 --> 52:49.920
Wait, I thought you said my speed was, like, tall. Are you serious?

52:55.280 --> 52:57.200
I thought you said my speed was good.

52:57.360 --> 53:10.800
Bro, as if I'm not already debuffed enough. I thought you said my speed was good.

53:13.440 --> 53:21.840
I am never picking a heavy again. Oh my god. I love yours, but I don't features any time,

53:21.840 --> 53:30.320
but for driving in Mario Kart, this is terrible. Acceleration does not equal speed.

53:30.320 --> 53:37.920
So then what with the fricking speed? Oh my god, there's random pinballs bumping in the map as well?

53:38.960 --> 53:45.760
No, not now. Stop throwing your flamethrower at me. Go, baby. Right, okay, we're doing the AC

53:45.760 --> 53:52.400
method. We're babying it the fuck up. Right, we're doing baby next round, and we're going to get

53:52.400 --> 53:57.200
fricking, right, let's go, let's go, let's go. Oh my god, that's messing with my eyes, holy crap.

53:59.440 --> 54:03.200
Yeah, I'm so big and clunky.

54:06.560 --> 54:12.800
I mean, I'm not dead last, then again, send a disconnect. So I think there's only 11 people

54:13.600 --> 54:18.400
in this map right now. Oh, this one's tricky.

54:22.160 --> 54:25.040
I like how everyone makes a noise as well in game. Like,

54:25.040 --> 54:39.200
like, I'm going to like all the way and do it saying all the way, all the way, all the way,

54:39.200 --> 54:44.240
all the way, all the way. I love that all the way. So it's the best thing created in this game.

54:44.800 --> 54:54.320
Oh, I love all these wee sounds. I wonder if I could do toad.

55:00.480 --> 55:04.640
Oh my god, it's because I put flight mode on by accident. How do you,

55:05.600 --> 55:10.800
how does one put on flight mode by accident? I don't even know how to access those panels.

55:11.440 --> 55:17.040
Are you serious? I don't know how, oh my god, that slowed me down so much.

55:20.160 --> 55:23.760
Oh my god, I've got like a little gear stick thing going on. Hi Wario.

55:24.720 --> 55:30.960
That was on purpose. You had plenty of room for the both of us and you chose to do that, Wario.

55:30.960 --> 55:36.000
Please don't think I'm not aware of. Right, fuck first place. Whoever, there's a blue shell coming

55:36.000 --> 55:41.520
for whoever's in first place and it was Wario. Don't rub it in my face that you got the golden

55:41.520 --> 55:52.000
freaking thing. Oh my gosh, Wario, you're so rude. Oh my god, this is so dangerous, this map.

55:56.960 --> 56:00.720
As if you get that and I don't get that. Come on, who deserves it more, be honest.

56:01.680 --> 56:06.720
Oh, that was rubbish. Somehow I held a button and it popped on. I'm going to great, right? Take

56:06.720 --> 56:10.320
this as a warm up because you're all done, so Winston is in the lobby. Oh yeah.

56:12.800 --> 56:18.400
Honestly. Wait, was that last place? Wait, did two reeflings just connect? I mean,

56:18.400 --> 56:23.200
Sin obviously counts as a reefling. Excellent, excellent, excellent. Wait, let's do Sherbert land.

56:23.200 --> 56:30.160
That looks quite easy. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11.

56:30.800 --> 56:37.760
Yeah, you were like, wait, why do you have a golden crown on you? Wait, did you win two in a row

56:37.760 --> 56:44.480
and now you've got a golden crown to flaunt it? No way. No way, the game is rubbing it in her

56:44.960 --> 56:51.920
face. Oh, Cryoniku's most points. Okay, we all spit on him. Got it. I know what to do.

56:53.760 --> 56:59.040
Okay, I picked, I already forgot what I picked. Oh, there's the Roman Coliseum.

57:00.480 --> 57:04.400
What is this? This course has been, I don't know what it is. What it is.

57:06.800 --> 57:10.160
There's a missing person. I wonder who is supposed to be then.

57:10.160 --> 57:23.680
Okay, second race. I am never picking a heavy again. Excite, bake. Excite, bake. Excitobico desu.

57:23.680 --> 57:32.800
That was terrible. Are we like rally racers? Oh, we can jump off in the air.

57:33.280 --> 57:36.400
Okay, I like that.

57:39.200 --> 57:45.280
Yeah. Whoa. Oh, there's mud on the track. Oh, we need to be careful not to touch the mud.

57:45.920 --> 57:49.840
Don't want my tires to get all sticky now, do I?

57:53.520 --> 57:59.040
Okay, well, I just took myself for that. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Let me kick. Let me kick.

57:59.040 --> 58:08.480
I'm eighth place. I'll take it. Oh, there's like, nah, you took my, wait. No. Oh my God.

58:08.480 --> 58:14.240
Wait, how did you just drift over the mud? I'm sorry, but how did he just drift over the mud?

58:15.920 --> 58:21.760
Is that for real? Like for real? For real? How did he do that? Did he cheat? Or am I going crazy?

58:21.760 --> 58:25.840
Shake your controller when you do, when you jump to, sorry, I'm not even reading,

58:25.920 --> 58:32.080
airplane. Shake your controller when you jump to do a trick and get a mini boost.

58:33.200 --> 58:36.960
How did that refling go through the mud? But when I go through the mud,

58:36.960 --> 58:41.520
it's like literally a bog. And it's, as if it's not like a two foot puzzle.

58:42.800 --> 58:45.440
A two foot puzzle. What the fuck? A two foot puzzle.

58:46.560 --> 58:49.200
When you go off a ramp, wait, shake my controller.

58:50.000 --> 58:59.520
Oh, wait, how does it know I'm doing that? Oh my God, I'm starting on that. How does it know

58:59.520 --> 59:07.840
I'm doing that? That's so cool. Oh, that's so cool. Oh my God, it knows when I shake.

59:19.280 --> 59:23.680
Feel the noise. Okay, that didn't work. Oh my God, it knows when I'm shaking.

59:23.680 --> 59:28.480
Shake and bake. Oh, oh, it didn't do it that time. That's okay. I forgive it. Shake, shake, shake,

59:28.480 --> 59:35.840
shake, shake, shake, shake. Oh, I'm jerking off this controller right now. Oh, that's so fun.

59:35.840 --> 59:40.960
Thank you for telling me. I didn't even know you could do that. Oh my God, I ignored the mud.

59:42.240 --> 59:46.080
It is chaos. It is chaos back here. It's absolutely chaos.

59:47.040 --> 59:54.000
Right, I got eighth or something. I don't know. Oh my God. Shake your controller or press Z.

59:54.640 --> 01:00:01.360
There's no Z. There's no Z. Is it triggers? Be honest. There's a bumper in triggers. You'll have

01:00:01.360 --> 01:00:08.720
to tell me in Xbox terms. Wish I was Johnny's controller right now. Improvement, eighth place.

01:00:08.720 --> 01:00:16.320
All I had to do was start doing... Let's do tick tock clock because I have tick tock brain rot.

01:00:17.680 --> 01:00:22.320
The triggers are ZR. Why on earth would they call them that?

01:00:24.320 --> 01:00:26.880
I don't think I could have been hit by any more Ioms.

01:00:27.600 --> 01:00:30.400
Honestly, me every time I go around the map, I'm getting ruled.

01:00:31.200 --> 01:00:40.960
All you had to do was literally... Lutuber figures out how to win Mario Kart. All she has to do is like

01:00:40.960 --> 01:00:44.960
fucking... I just spilled cola down myself if you heard me get a napkin. Sorry.

01:00:47.440 --> 01:00:53.360
Give me coconut mole or give me death. I'll pick coconut mole. Where was it? What are my points?

01:00:53.360 --> 01:00:56.400
Oh my God, I have seven and I'm still last.

01:01:00.080 --> 01:01:02.880
This game is far too difficult. I said what I said.

01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:11.280
Okay, third race. We've got one more and then in comes... I'll have... I don't even have freaking

01:01:11.280 --> 01:01:20.240
discord open. Right. You guys will let us in and so I don't need to... Oh. Oh, how beautiful.

01:01:21.200 --> 01:01:27.120
Oh my God, it reminds me of Christmas. Oh wait, can I do tricks in the air? No, I can't. Okay, sorry.

01:01:28.640 --> 01:01:32.720
Sorry if you hear me like violently shaking in the background. It's because I'm trying to get it working.

01:01:34.240 --> 01:01:41.040
Please stop bumping into me. Oh, he almost went off the road. I think he may have went off... Oh, it's spin.

01:01:41.760 --> 01:01:51.520
Whoa, what? How am I not dead? Take that. See, if I use that against someone, it's funny,

01:01:51.520 --> 01:01:58.160
but if someone uses it against me, I'm not laughing anymore. Okay, this is like really going for my

01:01:58.160 --> 01:02:05.040
eyes. I have to admit this is a lot of color scheme going on. It's a chomp chomp not to be confused

01:02:05.120 --> 01:02:14.320
with womp womp. Any chompers? Oh my God, I'm actually... Sorry, I'm actually not doing that bad. Hold on.

01:02:15.840 --> 01:02:20.000
If I can get lucky and not have items used against me, that'd be grand.

01:02:22.320 --> 01:02:27.680
I might actually have a decent position unless the reeflings are... Okay, they're plotting. I'm

01:02:27.680 --> 01:02:32.880
back to sixth place. I'm getting put in my... Sorry, I'm getting put back in my spot again. Sorry,

01:02:32.880 --> 01:02:39.600
I got a bit over... I got a bit overconfident. I thought maybe there was hope. Uh, I spoke far too

01:02:39.600 --> 01:02:51.600
soon. I had hope. Okay, I had hope. Stop! That's what you get for being a doodoo haze. Oh no, I missed it.

01:02:52.160 --> 01:02:59.600
Jump jump jump! It's starting on them. What does that even mean?

01:03:01.680 --> 01:03:08.800
Who was I fourth and I'm ninth? Are you serious? Oh, I'm still dead luck. Oh, well at least I'm

01:03:08.800 --> 01:03:12.560
locked on with another reefling. Get wrecked. Both of us suck. What are you gonna do about it?

01:03:13.120 --> 01:03:20.400
Are you gonna kiss me? Team Slug is getting off target. Start, stop! She's kind of getting

01:03:20.400 --> 01:03:26.720
the hang of it, not really. Is this where we find out mommy is more sensitive? Jumping,

01:03:26.720 --> 01:03:33.120
not quite, but showing on your butt. Oh yeah. Right, one more map. I want to pick Hyrule because

01:03:33.120 --> 01:03:41.040
we saved it the other week. Link, you came to town. You came to save the princess Zelda.

01:03:42.560 --> 01:04:10.480
I didn't 100% the game. No, about 100% at the figurines, which I've never done before. That was

01:04:10.480 --> 01:04:21.840
actually pretty crazy. That was crazy. Okay, last lap. Ready. Oh, we got coconut. This doesn't

01:04:21.840 --> 01:04:28.160
look like coconut mole. Is this like coconut mole version like 3.0 because of how many times

01:04:28.160 --> 01:04:34.000
they've got it? You just got coconut mold. Wait, is that a thing? Is this a Mario meme I don't know

01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:48.800
about? Stormy, I will become a chomp chomp. Wait. I'm not even mad that I suck. This is actually

01:04:48.800 --> 01:05:02.720
a really good song and map. Okay, I don't really want to go in the fountains. I don't think that's

01:05:02.800 --> 01:05:10.960
going to speed me up at all. Oh my goodness. I just realized there's a mini map to the right

01:05:10.960 --> 01:05:18.720
that I can see what's kind of up ahead. This is not like Nintendo DS coconut mole. I don't remember

01:05:18.720 --> 01:05:27.600
any of this. Who is doing burnouts in the middle of the track? Who is doing burnouts in the middle

01:05:27.600 --> 01:05:34.480
of the freaking track? That's outrageous. Get on my ticket right now. This is? Oh my god, I don't

01:05:34.480 --> 01:05:59.520
remember it at all. I'm trying. I'm trying so hard right now. Is it going to peel? We'll find

01:05:59.520 --> 01:06:06.000
out in a minute. We'll find out in a minute. Sorry, sorry replaying that was me. No, I'm sorry.

01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:15.280
I said the S word. Yeah, I'll take that. I'll show you. No, I said I'm sorry. You're supposed to...

01:06:15.280 --> 01:06:21.280
Wait, he's got boomerang in his hand. Is that for me? Right, okay. I was getting worried that boomerang

01:06:21.280 --> 01:06:28.400
was for me. I had to put on the brakes a little there. If you go to the fountain and jump, you can

01:06:28.480 --> 01:06:34.400
do this trick again. Why is it putting me up the wrong one? There is the other thing.

01:06:36.080 --> 01:06:41.440
What a few... Okay, trick. Again, I got another bullet. Oh my god, I have a chance to actually be

01:06:41.440 --> 01:06:47.600
in a decent rank. Not the only time I have a chance to win is when I get given the bullet.

01:06:47.600 --> 01:07:00.480
Okay, please cars, please, please, please, please. My best score yet. A fifth place. Oh my god,

01:07:00.480 --> 01:07:07.920
not the only time I literally have a chance to get any score is when I'm five. And that puts me

01:07:07.920 --> 01:07:16.480
third place. My best ranking. My best ranking third place. Oh my god. Oh my god, record breaking

01:07:16.480 --> 01:07:24.640
on Team Slag. I got third place. Last third last. Sorry, not third place. Third last. Third last.

01:07:25.280 --> 01:07:31.280
I did it. And it probably would have been less if Sen was playing because she would have beaten me.

01:07:31.280 --> 01:07:37.600
I'm not gonna lie. Not gonna lie. Sen would have beaten me. The only way that worked is because

01:07:37.600 --> 01:07:44.000
I got given a bullet on ninth place. Right, I will reset the lobby and we'll make sure Sen gets in.

01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:57.040
That was fun. You're ready. Yes. Right, let's do a baby. Oh my god. You know, she looks so determined.

01:07:57.040 --> 01:08:05.520
I actually ain't seen. Fifth place. The deal is a deal. Time to offer myself up. Reflings. I'm going

01:08:05.520 --> 01:08:13.920
on the head. No, wait, what? I thought I had to win. You had to win. Right, so what do I want?

01:08:13.920 --> 01:08:21.760
Acceleration? Acceleration. And then we need a bit of speed or not, I guess.

01:08:24.800 --> 01:08:31.760
Okay, max acceleration, but that takes in so much speed. I've got no idea. I'm just going for it.

01:08:31.760 --> 01:08:41.040
Sorry, I have no idea what I'm doing. Look, I'm here for a good time. I don't know anything.

01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:46.640
Don't be surprised if we don't stream Snape on this game again in the future. That's all I'm saying.

01:08:47.280 --> 01:08:53.360
She's doing an acceleration build. Oh, that's the MLG. Okay, the lobby code is...

01:08:53.360 --> 01:09:04.480
I'm stretching, sorry. I need to stretch first before I can even think. Right,

01:09:07.360 --> 01:09:15.760
a Jai, a T, a 4, a P, and a 2. I have no idea. No, you won fifth or third place.

01:09:15.760 --> 01:09:21.760
No, you won fifth or third place, lol. I'm offering my body to you.

01:09:23.120 --> 01:09:30.480
Reefling? I don't know how to tell you this. When I said I was third place, I meant I was third last,

01:09:30.480 --> 01:09:34.720
which is an improvement on being second and last last. I'm so sorry.

01:09:37.200 --> 01:09:45.040
Thank you, Kai no one for this purchase. When I said third place, I meant third last because

01:09:45.120 --> 01:09:53.840
I don't have a chance. Are you strawdier? Are you in? Is she the one with the pink hair?

01:09:54.480 --> 01:10:02.720
L plus ratio, let's go. Is that? I'll give it my best shot. Is that her? Go easy on me.

01:10:02.720 --> 01:10:07.600
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven. Okay, we have room for two more

01:10:07.600 --> 01:10:15.360
if that's Sen over there in the pink. I don't know if that's Sen or not. Go easy on me.

01:10:16.160 --> 01:10:20.960
They're crying. It says I'm currently spectating. Check in my head, the lobby isn't full. Why would

01:10:20.960 --> 01:10:31.920
you say that? I'm looking ass in the game. How dare you? Show yourself. Literally, the lobby's not

01:10:31.920 --> 01:10:38.000
full. It says one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven. Wait, Sen, have you

01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:49.760
bought like the online pass from Nintendo servers? Surely you have them. Yeah, they want you to buy

01:10:49.760 --> 01:10:54.400
like, it's like Xbox Game Pass but for Switch. Do you have the online servers?

01:10:54.640 --> 01:10:58.720
Yes, okay, you do have it unfortunately.

01:11:01.680 --> 01:11:04.400
She was in the lobby last time. Oh yeah, you were. What a dumb ass.

01:11:05.040 --> 01:11:08.560
Wait, it says there's a missing spot so I don't know how you're spectating.

01:11:08.560 --> 01:11:13.520
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven. Yeah, there's room for one more.

01:11:15.040 --> 01:11:21.200
Restart and hide the code with your body and then send it to Sen. Oh no, the refillings are

01:11:21.200 --> 01:11:25.040
polite enough that they'll back out. I'm seeing twelve. Wait, can I not count? One, two, three,

01:11:25.040 --> 01:11:32.320
four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven. Where's the twelve? One, two, three, four, five,

01:11:32.320 --> 01:11:36.880
six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven. No, you're trolling me. You're making me double think numbers

01:11:36.880 --> 01:11:46.480
and stuff. Did she press flight mode again? We will never know. How are you spectating?

01:11:46.720 --> 01:11:54.480
Now I'm going to go out on a limb and say that's not Sen. Okay, now there's twelve.

01:11:57.440 --> 01:12:00.560
Wait, so why are you spectating and not in the lobby?

01:12:02.240 --> 01:12:06.400
That's bizarre. Why would it make you spectate? I'm not making you spectate.

01:12:07.040 --> 01:12:13.840
If there's any reflings that have had a shot to play with me today, is it okay if I kindly request

01:12:13.840 --> 01:12:24.400
you lead to try and get Sen in? Thank you, reflings. Oh, there she is. There she is. Boris Johnson.

01:12:24.400 --> 01:12:29.200
Thanks for showing up, Boris. We missed you. We missed you, Boris. Then you come. Okay, I don't

01:12:29.200 --> 01:12:34.560
know why that didn't work at first, but that's definitely her. There's Boris. Hooray. I'm using

01:12:34.560 --> 01:12:40.400
tilt controls. Wait, are you guys like rubbing it in my face that I have to use evens? Wait,

01:12:40.400 --> 01:12:46.480
why am I in but I can't see that I'm in? Wait, your switch doesn't even display it? I don't

01:12:46.480 --> 01:12:51.920
want you to time out again. Are you guys like rubbish connection? It says I'm currently... Well,

01:12:51.920 --> 01:13:01.120
you're in my lobby. I'm not sure about that. I'm using tilt controls as a... Oh, we missed you, Boris.

01:13:03.680 --> 01:13:08.800
Why is it so hard to try and team up with the freaking VTuber? I don't know why. Like,

01:13:08.800 --> 01:13:14.560
anytime two people try and collide that are VTubers, the thing just doesn't work. I think it's

01:13:14.560 --> 01:13:22.880
on your end, Sen. Yeah. Oh, no, this can't be. Can't a moment. Well, just go for it. VTuber scoff.

01:13:22.880 --> 01:13:28.480
Literally, like, Minazur were like talking and voice chat for like two hours before the collab,

01:13:28.480 --> 01:13:33.200
and then like 15 minutes before, everyone needs to clear the lobby and let me be far.

01:13:33.920 --> 01:13:39.920
Do you want to try that? I need to... Right, okay, hold on. I'm going to reset the lobby.

01:13:42.320 --> 01:13:47.520
If everyone could kindly let Sen come in first, okay?

01:13:50.320 --> 01:13:54.320
I trust you guys to show the code, but you're not all going to come flying in, okay?

01:13:55.280 --> 01:14:01.920
I have no idea what I selected. Right, the code, Sen. Would you kindly...

01:14:03.840 --> 01:14:12.720
Sen, the code is 042 Charlie Gamma. Sen, getting special treatment.

01:14:13.440 --> 01:14:17.680
Favouritism by my VTuber? More likely than you think.

01:14:18.560 --> 01:14:24.240
Shocking behaviour. Shocking. Okay, let's see if she can come in.

01:14:28.800 --> 01:14:31.520
Anyone else who comes in is getting nuked off the stratosphere.

01:14:35.200 --> 01:14:41.840
Well, you didn't hesitate, did you? Right, can you see that, Sen? Because we can see you and

01:14:41.840 --> 01:14:48.560
Big Boris Johnson. Ah, you guys didn't he? Oh, she talked. She talked in game.

01:14:50.480 --> 01:14:51.520
She talked in game.

01:14:54.240 --> 01:14:57.520
One, two, three, four. Ew, what is that?

01:14:59.200 --> 01:15:05.040
You look like a... Oh, okay, five. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine,

01:15:05.040 --> 01:15:10.640
ten, eleven, twelve. Oh my god, we did it. We did it. It only took us like five whole minutes.

01:15:10.640 --> 01:15:16.800
Smile. Why is my name Boris now? It was Sinfors Johnny and now I'm Boris?

01:15:17.520 --> 01:15:27.040
Stop, that's funny. No themes, normal items. Sands from Undertale? How is that Sands from Undertale?

01:15:30.400 --> 01:15:35.600
Who have we not played? We've not played Grumble Volcano, as far as I'm aware.

01:15:35.840 --> 01:15:46.560
It was meant to be a part. We're doing it. We're playing together.

01:15:47.920 --> 01:15:54.560
One race only. Wait, did I mess up? Was it not four races? I've been leaving it on default.

01:15:55.680 --> 01:16:00.560
Did I mess up? It took us so long to come together and I'm going to ruin it.

01:16:01.520 --> 01:16:09.120
Hi, thanks for joining. You're welcome to stream snipe. This course has been selected.

01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:16.320
In chat, your character said four races. Damn straight it is. Okay, here we go.

01:16:18.320 --> 01:16:23.920
Okay, okay, we're doing it. We're doing it. We're ready, baby Rosalina. Come on, baby Rosalina. I

01:16:23.920 --> 01:16:32.480
believe in you. Are you squidding me right now? Zion! It's a miracle I could still watch you at 720p

01:16:32.480 --> 01:16:37.680
out here in the boonies. I believe in you, strongy. Are you putting your face in the wrong

01:16:37.680 --> 01:16:44.080
streamer? You should put your stonks in as Sin. I'm not even kidding. Right, where is she? We need to

01:16:44.080 --> 01:16:52.560
try and enable Sin. Either we'll enable Sin or we'll just go for it. Thank you for the tips,

01:16:52.640 --> 01:17:02.480
Zion. Okay, I don't know where she is. I can't see her. Is she behind me?

01:17:03.760 --> 01:17:08.880
No, Sin are officially boosting me. Stop, could you imagine? Right, I'm going to keep the green on

01:17:08.880 --> 01:17:13.840
me so if anyone touches me they get walloped. I said what I said. Right, we're going up the stairs.

01:17:13.840 --> 01:17:18.720
I'm literally copying the reeflings. I'm keeping the green on me.

01:17:18.720 --> 01:17:26.320
I'm getting inked on. I'm getting inked on. But it's not that time. I don't know. Give me like

01:17:26.320 --> 01:17:33.920
less than a week. It's less than a week. Let's do this. As much as I like holding on to that.

01:17:39.040 --> 01:17:43.440
I like the maps that change. Like they have changing elements. Like the trainers in the way

01:17:43.440 --> 01:17:50.960
and stuff. I like that. Oops. Oh, the game all steered me away from that. You're so stinky,

01:17:50.960 --> 01:17:57.520
Mr. Video Game. I don't know. I think Sin might be behind me. I have no idea what character she is.

01:17:59.360 --> 01:18:01.040
Oopsie. Oh, well that worked.

01:18:06.320 --> 01:18:11.120
Where is she? Is she ahead? Oh my god. And before she's like first place right now.

01:18:11.120 --> 01:18:16.400
And she's like I've never played this game before. And she's just absolutely annihilating me.

01:18:23.680 --> 01:18:29.280
Oh, there's a car. Oh no, I'm in the gravel. Get off the gravel. Off the gravel. Off the gravel.

01:18:32.880 --> 01:18:37.600
We're almost there. Whoa, whoa, whoa. You can destroy the subway car if you have

01:18:37.600 --> 01:18:46.400
the dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee on. Come on. Come on. I can make it.

01:18:47.280 --> 01:18:52.160
I can make it. No, I can't make it if you guys are doing maneuvers like that. Don't be so red.

01:18:54.080 --> 01:18:59.600
Where is she? Oh god. Damn, she just won't be when I train on one. Literally, the person is so far

01:18:59.600 --> 01:19:07.440
behind. Is she actually? So you're telling me the secret to winning against the Reeflands

01:19:07.440 --> 01:19:11.760
is to call in my friends that I've never played Mario Kart. Billets should be banned.

01:19:12.720 --> 01:19:18.960
You should be getting them. You should be getting the billets because you're last. The game should

01:19:18.960 --> 01:19:26.400
have a higher rate of getting the billets. That's hilarious. Wait, are you on your desktop?

01:19:26.400 --> 01:19:33.040
Can I get you in a Discord call? If you're at your desktop, I can literally open up Discord right

01:19:33.040 --> 01:19:37.440
now and get your voice on stream. I don't know if you're on your desktop though or if you're just

01:19:37.440 --> 01:19:44.880
chilling. How does that help you beat the Reeflings? Well, it'll make me higher up in general.

01:19:45.200 --> 01:19:55.200
Baby Park? Is that the worst map in the game? Baby Park?

01:19:55.200 --> 01:20:17.040
Yeah, that's unfortunately how it is when you're left.

01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:25.360
So you need to use the triggers to like tilt and then a boost you or something, but I don't really

01:20:25.360 --> 01:20:32.640
understand it. So yeah, I just kind of ignore the whole mechanic. I'm sure the mechanic is

01:20:32.640 --> 01:20:38.320
literally the reason why I'm losing, but oh no, I'm on the sand. Don't go on the sand.

01:20:38.400 --> 01:20:42.160
Don't go on the sand. How is there sand and snow?

01:20:44.480 --> 01:20:50.720
Oh, it's clouds. We're in the clouds. Oh, it's Jack and the Beanstalk. That's so cute.

01:20:50.720 --> 01:20:54.000
Okay, I like this map. Wait, I like this map. It's very cute.

01:20:56.720 --> 01:21:04.160
You go around a circle seven times? Not in this map. I only did it. I did everything like four

01:21:04.720 --> 01:21:12.240
rounds of three, four rounds of three. That's not even a sentence. Do you want to try again?

01:21:12.960 --> 01:21:21.040
There's four races in a circuit. Come on, oh wait. Honestly, I'm like, should I just

01:21:21.040 --> 01:21:28.720
shove myself into walls? That may work. You know, I read his pen bananas on the track.

01:21:29.440 --> 01:21:36.640
Literally, you know how like, there's always a music tag and they're like, oh, on the beat.

01:21:36.640 --> 01:21:43.440
His pen bananas on the track is going to be my one. Okay. Oh no. I've just checked the HUD on the

01:21:43.440 --> 01:21:51.920
right side. Sin person. She's like on her own all the way back there. I feel really bad.

01:21:52.640 --> 01:21:57.120
Should I drive next to her? You know what? I'll wait up. I'll wait up. Oh,

01:21:57.200 --> 01:22:05.360
she's got a bullet. She's got a bullet. She's coming. Okay, she's coming. There she goes.

01:22:06.560 --> 01:22:12.960
Look at Sin. Right, let's spectate her gameplay. Let's, ow, let's spectate that gameplay.

01:22:14.160 --> 01:22:19.120
Okay, she's cat. She's going around. She's picked up an item. Oh, she's picked up a bullet,

01:22:19.120 --> 01:22:22.880
bro. If I can, you keep up. Not me last place because I was trying to freaking hang out with Sin.

01:22:22.880 --> 01:22:30.240
Bro, she got a bullet. Why am I sideways? Okay, that's fine. I'll love it. Okay.

01:22:31.760 --> 01:22:36.880
I got kicked. Why am I hacked by a random boy? Wait, how did you get kicked? You were literally

01:22:36.880 --> 01:22:43.600
right in front of me. Wait, you were. I came in before you. Why? How do you get timed out?

01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:50.880
Oh, Shrani got her hair putts and she can't hear us. Goose trying to go. 78% on town, mom.

01:22:54.160 --> 01:22:58.240
I'm going to do Wailed Woods. This is where I'm going to live with the Weeflings.

01:22:59.280 --> 01:23:02.960
How do you keep getting kicked? You have like other rubbish connection or something.

01:23:03.280 --> 01:23:12.480
Shrani, love. We feel a love. I just caught that in the last tip.

01:23:13.600 --> 01:23:18.240
Band items are for with these. Sin just can't win. You might be able to rejoin me.

01:23:20.320 --> 01:23:24.000
I'm not sure. Are you squiddin' me right now? Piney, spiny.

01:23:24.080 --> 01:23:29.280
Tell Sin that so far she has earned more points as Boris in this Mario Kart Tournament

01:23:29.280 --> 01:23:35.520
than he did in his last popularity poll. Bruh. I ain't seein' that. Bruh.

01:23:38.000 --> 01:23:45.040
Thank you for the tip, tiny spiny. Bruh. Bruh. Two. No.

01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:53.600
Oh, finally. I did it. Where the hell are we? We're in France! You know how you can tell?

01:23:53.600 --> 01:23:59.920
Because that's that one monument. They want to shut down the traffic at it because it's so bad.

01:24:01.520 --> 01:24:06.880
Oh, wait. Isn't the Olympics on? Or isn't the Olympics about to be on in France?

01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:22.160
I don't know how to say it in any other language. V gets Lou Olympics.

01:24:23.120 --> 01:24:24.640
Lou Olympics are awful.

01:24:27.200 --> 01:24:32.640
Okay, everyone's getting bananas. To say a banana- Oh, who just bummed me? To say banana in French?

01:24:32.640 --> 01:24:39.360
Or say unne-banane? That's right. Bananas are feminine in French. Why? I don't know.

01:24:39.840 --> 01:24:45.360
No. Wait, are they? Did I just make that up? Be honest. I think I just made that up. In banana.

01:24:46.240 --> 01:24:54.080
It just means one banana. A banana. New banana? La banana? What the heck am I supposed to do with

01:24:54.080 --> 01:24:59.680
all these? I have no idea. That was so much for no- I don't know what I'm supposed to do with those.

01:25:01.760 --> 01:25:07.200
They are feminine- Why would a banana be feminine in any language? Be honest right now. We all know

01:25:07.200 --> 01:25:13.760
what a banana is. I'm not sure. It makes no sense. I literally make no sense.

01:25:15.920 --> 01:25:24.160
And it's like, I'm pretty sure Bos and French are feminine as well, but a man's winky in French is-

01:25:24.160 --> 01:25:32.320
Are you kidding me? You took my thing. You took my golden thing. You're so stinky.

01:25:33.280 --> 01:25:39.200
I'm actually so stinky. Whoever did the thunderbolt? One, you aren't Zeus. You aren't him. And two,

01:25:41.360 --> 01:25:46.400
you stink. I can smell you and how hard you're sweating to ruin my game. That's right.

01:25:47.520 --> 01:25:50.720
You're not pheromone maxing. You're pheromone

01:25:52.640 --> 01:25:59.680
bogan. Oh, that's right. Take that insult. Take that insult. Take it. What are you going to do? Yeah,

01:26:00.560 --> 01:26:05.760
yeah, yeah. Where am I going? Oh, thank God. Oh, thank God. Oh, him just came in right now because

01:26:05.760 --> 01:26:16.240
I did not do that. That was- Oh, it says unironically. Okay, I got it. Oh, this is what I need. So I don't

01:26:16.240 --> 01:26:21.760
have to aim. Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go. Okay, I made

01:26:21.840 --> 01:26:24.400
it 8th. I literally cheated and made it to 8th place because of that.

01:26:27.520 --> 01:26:36.240
Die Banane in German is female. Spanish is word un banana. She hates us all, girl. He can't recover

01:26:36.240 --> 01:26:44.480
from that emotional damage. Yeah, please don't be surprised if I don't play this game on stream

01:26:44.480 --> 01:26:48.880
tonight for no particular reason at all. It's because I'm a share of the game. Yeah, for no reason,

01:26:49.760 --> 01:27:00.240
I don't really think we're going to be- Royal Raceway, King Candy, D.K. Donkey Kong, D.K.

01:27:01.520 --> 01:27:11.120
Donkey Kong is here. I'm finally back to kick something. The banana in Turkey is a must.

01:27:11.440 --> 01:27:22.320
I don't know why she's breaking out, but that was fun that she joined in anyway.

01:27:22.320 --> 01:27:25.920
She's probably got prepared for streamers. I don't know if she's streaming the day.

01:27:25.920 --> 01:27:30.560
She does Elden Ring and she actually plays it properly if you want to watch her Elden Ring streams.

01:27:32.160 --> 01:27:37.920
If you want to actually watch someone play Elden Ring,

01:27:38.800 --> 01:27:44.960
send sister on Twitch at 8pm GMT. I actually don't know what time she's streaming.

01:27:47.280 --> 01:27:52.240
I can't remember what time she's streaming that. It's a bit later. I think it's a bit later.

01:27:53.760 --> 01:28:00.400
Are you- Luigi, you just bumped me like three times. You know that cost money after the second

01:28:00.400 --> 01:28:05.920
throw to the second bump. Oh my god, we're bouncing though.

01:28:07.760 --> 01:28:14.640
Received it. No, no, don't start guessing my freaking name. That's naughty replaying.

01:28:14.640 --> 01:28:24.240
That's naughty and you know it's naughty. Oh my god, I think I just sniked Rosalina. I'm so sorry.

01:28:24.560 --> 01:28:34.560
I'm sorry. More like Pozalina, who's all she cares about. I'm just- I don't know what I'm even talking.

01:28:35.520 --> 01:28:41.600
I saw that. Whoever's in that freaking red car, I literally saw you just try and green me.

01:28:42.880 --> 01:28:49.040
What's your name? Mar? More like Shitebag McGee. Don't ever do that again. I literally saw you

01:28:49.040 --> 01:28:56.640
attempt that in Four Cave. I was shocking. I was shocking, honestly. Streams every day.

01:28:58.080 --> 01:29:05.120
You know, I'm actually speechless at that attempt on my life that you just made.

01:29:05.120 --> 01:29:11.440
Oh, I can do a flip. No, I can't. I'm too late. I'm actually speaking- Oh! Who just pinged that

01:29:12.400 --> 01:29:16.800
Oh my god, he went halfway across the map. Okay, last lap.

01:29:21.360 --> 01:29:28.160
Okay, I can do it. I can do it. Yatta, yatta, yatta, yatta. I'm doing all the gambas,

01:29:28.160 --> 01:29:32.400
but nothing's working out. Okay, nothing's working. I'm just here for a good time, not for a long time.

01:29:32.400 --> 01:29:40.400
Okay, please. Please understand. Okay, yeah, fuck you. I'm so sorry to that reflin. I'm so sorry.

01:29:40.480 --> 01:29:46.560
No, I'm so sorry. It's not me. It's not me. It's the game. It's the game.

01:29:47.520 --> 01:29:52.880
The game. Oh, I almost messed up so badly. I'm third place. I'm third place.

01:29:56.000 --> 01:30:06.160
I'm sprouted. Oh, I can't believe it. Oh, I got 11 points. Oh my god. I'm still second place though. Oh.

01:30:06.400 --> 01:30:26.640
Oh. Oh, I'm still second place though. Oh no. Oh no. I thought I did so well there.

01:30:28.480 --> 01:30:31.760
I'm sorry. I got so excited. I thought I did it.

01:30:32.080 --> 01:30:41.600
No, literally say, wait, was that last place? I'm not last though. I'm not last. That was fun.

01:30:41.600 --> 01:30:50.160
Yatta, good game. Okay, we do one more. Maybe two more. We have time for two more. One more two more.

01:30:50.400 --> 01:31:01.680
Wow. You're not last though. Broke him third place for nothing. Stop. I'm trying. Right.

01:31:03.600 --> 01:31:11.680
Why are we like male? Shirley peaches the Barbie to use. Wait, hold on. I need to do the plus thing.

01:31:14.000 --> 01:31:19.840
Right. You want me to go all out on acceleration? Okay, the burger mobile is acceleration. The wheels

01:31:19.840 --> 01:31:30.320
are acceleration. Why? Will on airs does any of this mean? Right. Let's just fucking go all out

01:31:30.320 --> 01:31:38.560
on acceleration in the burger mobile. Okay. I swear. I don't know why your switch is missing.

01:31:38.560 --> 01:31:47.440
Congrats on 15k, by the way. I have so much ASMR debt. I'm actually 15,000. That's insane. Hold on a

01:31:47.440 --> 01:31:56.720
minute. I ain't laughing. Hold on a minute. Am I actually 15,000? What? I am. I'm 15,000. What the

01:31:56.720 --> 01:32:10.080
heck? Reflins, where are you all coming from? What the heck? So one, that is some more video

01:32:10.080 --> 01:32:16.000
kind of blew up. The real thigh cupping and the please let me hold it like blew up twice.

01:32:18.160 --> 01:32:28.000
Yeah, I looked up and there was a fix. So let's find it. Congrats. Make it 20k before the bathroom.

01:32:28.000 --> 01:32:35.280
Well, the 15k ASMR celebration stream is a thigh cam ASMR. Like you're literally going to see my thighs

01:32:36.240 --> 01:32:40.800
and it's going to be pointed down on the ASMR making. We do thigh ASMR

01:32:42.480 --> 01:32:50.640
and like you can see me like do the the making. So I don't know what to do for 20k in all honesty.

01:32:50.640 --> 01:32:54.880
I ain't thought that far ahead. I've not even got my freaking ASMR collapse up and all that stuff.

01:32:55.040 --> 01:33:07.600
I'm going to aim back. What? Why are you gifting me 50 memberships for sucking at this video game?

01:33:09.760 --> 01:33:17.760
El Jeff. Thank you. What the heck? Thank you. El Jeff. That's amazing. Oh my gosh. That's so

01:33:17.760 --> 01:33:23.520
what? Why are you giving me gifted memberships for sucking so badly at a game? That's huge.

01:33:23.520 --> 01:33:29.040
Thank you. I think I've just unlocked a new emotes slot for that as well. What the heck?

01:33:29.040 --> 01:33:34.880
Thank you. Congrats to those who caught it with your face and enjoy the emotes. We have more emotes

01:33:34.880 --> 01:33:39.360
on the way and by more emotes on the way, I mean I need to ask you guys what more emotes you'd like

01:33:39.360 --> 01:33:47.520
to be on the way. Thank you so much. For those of you who don't talk in like the actual chat,

01:33:47.520 --> 01:33:52.000
I think there might be a prompt to say to accept gifted memberships. I'm not sure,

01:33:52.640 --> 01:33:58.320
but you might see it now. I don't know how it works. But yes, anyone's welcome to join the lobby

01:33:58.320 --> 01:34:06.160
because I think Sin can't get in at all. But thank you so much. El Jeff. More like El Chad.

01:34:06.160 --> 01:34:16.800
Waps down 50 gifted memberships. Walks away doesn't say anything. Chad behavior. Shocking Chad behavior.

01:34:17.600 --> 01:34:23.920
I'm a little nervous. I'm a little nervous. Gulp. I'm you. Hooray.

01:34:27.520 --> 01:34:33.680
Isn't that a deal? How do I join in? There's a room ID code to the right of my head.

01:34:35.120 --> 01:34:42.880
I'm pointing to it with my tongue. And then you use that code to join. As long as you have the game

01:34:42.880 --> 01:34:47.760
and stuff though. If you don't have the game, unfortunately, I can't help you pass that.

01:34:50.960 --> 01:34:55.040
El Jeff doesn't look at explosions. He just walks away like a badass.

01:34:57.920 --> 01:35:08.000
Reefling Delilah. How many is that? 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12. That's us. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7,

01:35:08.000 --> 01:35:19.920
8, 9, 10, 11, 12. Let's go. Oh wait. No. You guys are being forced to carry me. Do you understand

01:35:19.920 --> 01:35:29.360
Reeflings are in this lobby? Okay. Wait, you got in? Okay. You're being forced to carry me.

01:35:29.360 --> 01:35:38.080
You're being forced to carry me. Do you understand? This is online so I can't join.

01:35:39.120 --> 01:35:43.680
Strowny moment. I literally do not know how to play. Well, you're still carrying me anyway.

01:35:43.680 --> 01:35:50.560
I'm going to vote Sherbert Land. Oh wait. Melody Motorway? Oh my god. Melody. That hit

01:35:50.640 --> 01:35:59.760
VTuber Melody. Project Melody. Strowny carry at the end. Team Strowny versus Team Sin. I got the

01:35:59.760 --> 01:36:04.160
game. I just need to know how to hop in. There's like four of them. I should be like multiplayer

01:36:04.160 --> 01:36:10.080
and then a code. Oh yes. Because I'm last. I'm kicked out of Team Slag. I see you. Wait. It didn't

01:36:10.080 --> 01:36:15.840
let me pick. I just picked two teams. Am I going crazy? Don't forget to hit that like and subscribe

01:36:15.840 --> 01:36:23.200
button. Oh, I'm such a real VTuber honestly. Do you enjoy playing games with me, Reeflings?

01:36:23.200 --> 01:36:27.920
Don't forget to like the stream to let me know you want more stream sniping. I say that as if

01:36:27.920 --> 01:36:34.000
we're not playing chess next week. Literally brush up on your chess. Okay. The red team versus the blue

01:36:34.000 --> 01:36:43.040
team. Let's see what happens. Sauce to my team in advance, bro. Sauce to my team in advance.

01:36:43.040 --> 01:36:50.240
That's right. Let's see. Go.

01:36:55.120 --> 01:37:05.840
Okay. Now this is curious. This is very curious indeed. Because now that it's teamed,

01:37:06.800 --> 01:37:17.520
I am actually sorry. I'm going to try hard for this one. I don't want to let my team down.

01:37:18.640 --> 01:37:26.160
I don't want to let my team down, mom. I have to try my hardest in Mario Kart. I really don't want

01:37:26.160 --> 01:37:34.960
to upset anybody. I can't let them down. They try so hard for me. Literally every enemy ever.

01:37:36.800 --> 01:37:44.000
No, mom. You can't forbid me from doing the tournament. I need to try everything in my power.

01:37:46.160 --> 01:37:51.520
That sounds like every enemy protagonist. Please. I tried my best. Fuck it. I just destroyed a train.

01:37:55.840 --> 01:38:03.200
No, I can't give in yet. I have to try my hardest. My team, they're relying on me.

01:38:04.160 --> 01:38:12.320
Oh, I need to do everything in my power. Maybe stop with the bombs. Oh, but I can't let the bombs

01:38:12.320 --> 01:38:21.360
stop me. Even if I'm not first place, I have to give it my all. Come on, team. Wish the best for me.

01:38:23.840 --> 01:38:29.280
Oh, shit. The short cut for a minute. Sorry. I'm too busy. It is an enemy European right now.

01:38:29.600 --> 01:38:40.160
Oh, no. I've been struck by lightning, but I can't let that get me down. Oh, my gosh.

01:38:40.160 --> 01:38:48.640
I'm almost there. I'm trying so hard. But in the end, maybe it didn't even matter for my team.

01:38:49.200 --> 01:38:54.640
I'm on the last lap. Oh, no. A bomb stopped me in my track.

01:38:55.600 --> 01:39:02.880
Okay. Oh, wait. Just help me. I'm going to squid everywhere. Come on, me. Come on.

01:39:02.880 --> 01:39:05.920
So is anyone to let them down on Ironically? I need to try hard right now.

01:39:07.680 --> 01:39:12.320
Donkey Kong, you might have ruined this map for me, but that's not going to stop me.

01:39:13.200 --> 01:39:22.080
Oh, my gosh. I'm blasting ahead of the enemies. I can do it. I'm almost there. Please. No. Please.

01:39:22.080 --> 01:39:27.120
I'm actually trying hard and so much. Don't be rid. Don't be rid. I'm trying hard and so much.

01:39:27.120 --> 01:39:37.600
I don't even know what color team I am. I'm about to come. I'm about to buzz. Okay. Hold on. I'm

01:39:37.600 --> 01:39:44.080
just going to let all of you take over. I'm trying my best, please. Believe in me, team. I might not

01:39:44.160 --> 01:39:49.600
be the first place, but I tried my best. Come on, buddy. Team mate. Come on, buddy.

01:39:52.480 --> 01:39:57.360
Strony. Strony was a fanboy. Is that what you're saying? Your father, the villain,

01:39:57.360 --> 01:40:02.720
and he sent all your enemies. Wait, what was the result? I didn't pay attention. Did we win?

01:40:03.920 --> 01:40:10.080
I actually did worse than Strony and I'm on our team. No, you're supposed to carry me. Carry me.

01:40:11.040 --> 01:40:15.360
And then we'll play this game again if you carry me.

01:40:18.240 --> 01:40:21.840
Anyway, I'm in now. Hydration check.

01:40:26.080 --> 01:40:32.320
Okay, I seem to have the inability to not be able to drink properly. I have spilled cola on me three

01:40:32.320 --> 01:40:37.280
times a stream. I don't know what you're doing to me, reflings, but I'm getting nervous. I'm getting

01:40:37.280 --> 01:40:42.480
shaky, okay? I've spilled cola three times on myself. I don't know what's going on.

01:40:43.280 --> 01:40:49.120
Your comments made me laugh so hard I messed up. What are you talking about? I'm just a regular

01:40:49.120 --> 01:40:56.960
anime protagonist. I just have to try my best for my team, even if I don't come first. As long as

01:40:56.960 --> 01:41:05.680
I try my best, everything will work out in the end, right? Thanks, math, for the 20 gifted memberships.

01:41:05.680 --> 01:41:13.120
Congrats to those who caught it with your face. That's right. Even if you're not the protagonist,

01:41:13.120 --> 01:41:20.960
you can try your best to be the main person in your story. It's okay if you're an NPC.

01:41:20.960 --> 01:41:26.800
I'm so sorry. This is so first. Okay, let me try hard. I don't want to let my teammates down. Hold

01:41:26.800 --> 01:41:34.880
on. Unironically, I don't want to let them down. Even when I try my best, I'm such a baka. They're

01:41:34.960 --> 01:41:40.640
going to know that I'm not good at this game. Maybe they'll figure out that I actually haven't

01:41:40.640 --> 01:41:48.960
played it in a whole year, and the only experience I have with Mario Kart is actually in my childhood.

01:41:48.960 --> 01:41:56.320
Oh no, I can't let them know. I'll just pretend I'll fake it until I make it.

01:41:56.880 --> 01:42:06.880
This is absolutely tearing up my voice. Okay, okay, we cleared that banana off the tracks.

01:42:08.560 --> 01:42:16.000
That's my DJ signature. Banana off the tracks. Bananas and pajamas. They're coming in the stairs.

01:42:16.560 --> 01:42:23.360
Bananas. Oh, red. Right, I must be team blue. There's no way I'm not team blue.

01:42:24.080 --> 01:42:30.800
Due to the data that I have collected, i.e. on the right side, bottom right of the screen is blue,

01:42:30.800 --> 01:42:36.640
I assume that is me. Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, let's focus up. God, this track is tiny.

01:42:37.760 --> 01:42:41.600
Every is so tiny. Okay, hold on. I need you to kick in, please.

01:42:43.200 --> 01:42:46.240
Right, get flamethrowered. There's nothing you can do about it.

01:42:46.800 --> 01:42:56.800
Oh, did I do it? Did we win? Your team blue. Okay, where's the ASMR? I think you just

01:42:56.800 --> 01:43:00.240
liked someone on your team. Oh, is that even possible? Thank you so much again,

01:43:00.240 --> 01:43:04.320
Math for the gifted membership and LGF. That's insane. I'm pretty sure you guys have just

01:43:04.320 --> 01:43:14.400
collectively unlocked an emoteslot. Oh no, we're losing. I just, oops, I think we're losing.

01:43:16.560 --> 01:43:23.680
Ah, I'll do the electro dome. I don't know what. Oh, we're losing. Red is carrying.

01:43:23.680 --> 01:43:29.760
Who hit me with the shell? We're on the same damn team. Press L on the card screen or something.

01:43:31.440 --> 01:43:38.320
So close to the 96-69. Team Sen is pulling ahead. I can't believe it.

01:43:39.280 --> 01:43:43.840
Reflames, you're supposed to like, I don't know, carry me.

01:43:46.080 --> 01:43:51.600
And before you guys are like, you're uncariable. How do I pause? There's no pause.

01:43:52.400 --> 01:43:56.080
You would have to do it mid-game, I think. I don't know, maybe you could do it like right now.

01:43:58.320 --> 01:44:03.840
No one is allowed to say I'm uncariable. Okay, only my butt. You're allowed to insult my butt

01:44:03.840 --> 01:44:08.640
and say my butt's uncariable. So sit on your face. As it, if you don't carry me, everyone's

01:44:08.640 --> 01:44:12.640
getting a 30-second face sit. I don't care if you can't breathe, it's over for you.

01:44:12.640 --> 01:44:20.640
Oh, we're playing the Legend of Zelda map. Okay, let's go. Hyrule. Third race. Two remaining.

01:44:20.640 --> 01:44:22.560
Well, one remaining technically after this.

01:44:23.280 --> 01:44:31.840
Uh, two, wow. It's always really that much of a negative. I feel like it helps me.

01:44:31.840 --> 01:44:37.280
Oh my god, the coins are runes in this. Oh, I love it. Or rupees, sorry.

01:44:40.480 --> 01:44:48.240
Oh, I love it. I'm like way behind again. I'm trying, I'm trying, I'm trying.

01:44:49.200 --> 01:44:58.560
Wow. Oh no, I never shook it in time. Oh my god, the soundtrack is Legend of Zelda as well.

01:44:58.560 --> 01:45:07.520
This is so cute. I can hear it. I can hear it. Oh my god, that was a Hyruleian sword. Oh my god.

01:45:07.520 --> 01:45:12.400
I love this one, sorry. Oh my god. References that I actually know for once when it comes to

01:45:12.480 --> 01:45:18.080
Nintendo. Thank you, Minish Cap. We love you. We love you, Minish Cap.

01:45:19.920 --> 01:45:22.560
Please owe him, so I don't have to freaking steer.

01:45:27.840 --> 01:45:34.640
Thank you, Zarya. Anything for you, Refling. Anytime, it's a pleasure. I think my next ASMR

01:45:34.640 --> 01:45:37.520
upload is me sitting on the make. I don't think I'm going to get in trouble for it,

01:45:37.520 --> 01:45:40.560
because it's literally me just... Oh wait, no, I'm out of breath on it.

01:45:40.880 --> 01:45:41.840
I don't think I can do it.

01:45:44.160 --> 01:45:46.640
Oh, the wee baby's laughing. She's like,

01:45:47.600 --> 01:45:52.400
honestly, I'd be laughing too. Okay. Wait, let me focus up. Let me focus up.

01:45:53.920 --> 01:45:56.400
I'm just fucking throwing everything.

01:45:56.400 --> 01:46:10.400
Oh my god, it's so long-inspired. I love Legend of Long.

01:46:11.520 --> 01:46:19.680
Any Legend of Long fans? Sorry. I'm trying to make the best of the situation, but I'm so bad at the

01:46:19.680 --> 01:46:25.440
game. As if you just streamstepped my box. I hope you're at least on my team.

01:46:26.880 --> 01:46:29.200
Oh my god, someone's going to head with a freaking bullet.

01:46:30.000 --> 01:46:33.280
But not to be confused with the hit band, Bullet for My Valentine,

01:46:34.720 --> 01:46:37.040
which I can't even remember one single song from them.

01:46:42.000 --> 01:46:43.280
Oh, that's like so fast.

01:46:44.000 --> 01:46:51.840
Oh, I love... I'm sorry. Best map, sorry. I'm biased right now. I'm actually biased.

01:46:51.840 --> 01:46:58.480
Oh, no, no, no, no, no. I'm so tiny. There's nothing wrong with being tiny, okay.

01:46:59.840 --> 01:47:06.960
SPH Bulls, rise up. Seriously. Wait, go, go, go. Okay, I got seventh place.

01:47:07.200 --> 01:47:13.680
Is that what that means? Did I get seventh place? Oh, I did actually get seventh place.

01:47:15.360 --> 01:47:18.800
Oh my god, that's actually not... Oh my god, I'm like legit seventh place. Hold on a minute.

01:47:19.440 --> 01:47:24.480
Hold on a minute. Hold on a minute. Oh, can we bring it back though? Kiki9 is trying

01:47:24.480 --> 01:47:30.640
as hard as to carry all of us. Sit on top, lad. Seventh place, you got one position higher.

01:47:31.680 --> 01:47:36.400
I'll be so positioned high on you. I tried, I tried. I can't do it off the top of my head.

01:47:36.400 --> 01:47:42.560
I tried so... No, no, stop showing me the DLC, honestly. Get away. Hold on. Let's pick.

01:47:46.160 --> 01:47:49.680
Did we end up? Have we played the cheese? Let's do animal crossing.

01:47:51.200 --> 01:47:56.960
Send best team, send red top on top. Thank you again, Zarian, for the tip. I will suffocate you.

01:47:57.520 --> 01:48:09.760
Can blue make the comeback, unless all of us collectively like five head this?

01:48:10.640 --> 01:48:17.040
I don't think so. There's only so much carrying the top blue person can do.

01:48:17.040 --> 01:48:20.240
I'm always last, but Team Sin winnin'. Bravo, literally.

01:48:21.200 --> 01:48:23.520
Like, oh my god, I can't believe it.

01:48:24.560 --> 01:48:33.520
Send it on top of strongy. If anything, I'd be dominating Sin. Thank you, I'll be here all week.

01:48:35.760 --> 01:48:41.040
Okay, final race. This is it. This is it. Let's make or break.

01:48:41.520 --> 01:48:51.840
Let's go. Hold on a minute. Hold on a minute, Luigi. We're on the same team now. You just can't

01:48:51.840 --> 01:48:58.560
win. You just can't win, Luigi. Why am I drifting that way? Please don't do that again.

01:48:59.360 --> 01:49:01.360
Wow.

01:49:04.320 --> 01:49:10.880
Oh my god, that's actually so creative. That's so good. Thank you, Sleepy Phoenix.

01:49:10.880 --> 01:49:16.240
That's so creative. I'm sorry, I'm bumping everyone. Call me Mario because I'm going to carry.

01:49:16.240 --> 01:49:21.520
What? Call me Mario because I'm going to princess carry that peach. Hey, smooth with it.

01:49:21.520 --> 01:49:28.240
I'm so slow. I can't believe there's unironically a Mario meta. This is insane.

01:49:29.280 --> 01:49:34.160
This game's too difficult for brainless like me. Sometimes we just want to

01:49:36.080 --> 01:49:41.120
be dumb. Is that too much to ask for? To be left alone in my dumbassery?

01:49:43.840 --> 01:49:46.240
Oh, there's a ch- What?

01:49:46.560 --> 01:49:48.560
What?

01:49:50.160 --> 01:49:57.040
Literally, what were we supposed to do? A freaking train? Wait, that was my teammate. I'm sorry.

01:49:57.040 --> 01:50:02.080
I didn't realize you had to be tactical with items. I thought they all did it. Like, oh, that's my teammate.

01:50:03.680 --> 01:50:09.840
Oh my god, I'm 11th now. Oh, there was a train. I wasn't looking. This is why you shouldn't

01:50:09.840 --> 01:50:15.040
drive whilst on your phone because you will not see what you have to do unironically.

01:50:17.200 --> 01:50:22.320
Oh my gosh. Last lap. We're on like a whole different map.

01:50:25.200 --> 01:50:35.040
Stop. You're being bully. Okay. Hold on. Oh no, no, no, no, no. You're not supposed to do that.

01:50:36.160 --> 01:50:42.880
I'm 7th again. I mean, it's something. I'll take it. Can I get something that'll speed me up? No,

01:50:43.760 --> 01:50:48.080
not really what I want to do. I'm just going to have to- Oh, I just walked into my own green

01:50:48.080 --> 01:50:52.000
shell. No one saw that. That's embarrassing. I actually just went into my own green shell.

01:50:55.600 --> 01:50:59.360
Bruh, I suck so bad at it. I'm 10.

01:50:59.680 --> 01:51:07.040
I think sin won. I think sin won.

01:51:09.760 --> 01:51:14.480
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay, we lost, but that's okay.

01:51:15.440 --> 01:51:23.280
Yatta. Go Red Team. You did it. No way. We don't even get a participation trophy. You guys get like

01:51:23.280 --> 01:51:29.600
a nice shiny trophy. And what did we get? Nothing. We don't even get a little medallion.

01:51:29.600 --> 01:51:37.600
Like, oh, congrats. You did it. Bruh. So rude. Oh no, now we have to get sound. Exactly. This is

01:51:37.600 --> 01:51:46.640
your punishment for not carrying me. That is shong. GG. Do you want one more or will we call it

01:51:46.640 --> 01:51:52.800
there and redirect into someone? It's up to you guys. Do you want one more or 16 points?

01:51:52.800 --> 01:51:59.280
Blue caught up from 30 points. That's huge though. You get a moist handshake and you will love it.

01:52:00.320 --> 01:52:04.560
One more? One more? Okay, like, I'll restart the lobby just to give

01:52:04.560 --> 01:52:09.280
other reflings a chance to streamstamp, okay? And then we'll do one more team game,

01:52:09.280 --> 01:52:14.480
and then I might be able to win. I might be able to win if reflings carry me.

01:52:16.880 --> 01:52:21.200
Don't be surprised if you slip on my banana. That is actually really good.

01:52:21.200 --> 01:52:23.920
Does that have my soundboard up? No, I don't have my soundboard up. Dram.

01:52:25.040 --> 01:52:28.240
Drat. I don't have my soundboard up. Okay, I just, I'll just pick we...

01:52:29.440 --> 01:52:35.280
Eepee. Okay, we're called Daisy now. Daisy, Duke, Spiky. Wait, is that not Madame?

01:52:37.440 --> 01:52:42.240
No, I've not played Daisy. Okay, sorry, sorry. I'm being dumb. Give me a second.

01:52:42.880 --> 01:52:46.880
Right, what do I want to do? Speed. Maybe let's do a bit more speed.

01:52:47.120 --> 01:52:51.680
Well, that wasn't exactly what I wanted to do, but hey, oh, well I did it anyway.

01:52:52.640 --> 01:53:03.680
One Sierra. Eight Sierra. Zero. I got kicked again from the final race, but your team's still one?

01:53:03.680 --> 01:53:09.680
Bruv. Just say you're lucky, Sin. You weren't even participating in the last race and still win.

01:53:10.320 --> 01:53:14.240
I dare you. These accusations are shopping.

01:53:14.960 --> 01:53:16.480
Hey.

01:53:22.160 --> 01:53:22.960
Ah, hold on.

01:53:28.000 --> 01:53:36.320
Is Sin in? Are you one back in? The game just hates me. Do you want back in, Sin, or are you just back in?

01:53:37.840 --> 01:53:41.040
That's right, I'm forcing you to watch my stream. What are you going to do about it, Sin?

01:53:41.760 --> 01:53:48.800
Only if you streamed on YouTube, I could redirect into you. Oh my god, I let a reflin last one. Oh

01:53:48.800 --> 01:53:54.400
my god, Sin is so selfless. Like, look how nice that she is. Right, one, two, three, four, five,

01:53:54.400 --> 01:54:01.520
six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11, 12. We're all here. Right, carry me. Do you understand? Do you

01:54:01.520 --> 01:54:09.200
understand me, reflings? Oh my, I realize I'm dumb. I'm too embarrassed to confess. Wait,

01:54:09.760 --> 01:54:14.560
have you been disconnecting yourself manually? I'm not going to switch the teams. I'm just going

01:54:14.560 --> 01:54:23.200
to leave them as is. So, I'll let the teams randomize. Sin, have you been doing something?

01:54:29.120 --> 01:54:33.520
What have you been doing? Did we play the Animal Crossing? I don't think I did.

01:54:33.920 --> 01:54:39.600
Yeah, last game. So, you guys better not let me lose.

01:54:41.440 --> 01:54:48.800
Call everyone who is in my team. I am summoning you to possess yourself with the most gaming

01:54:48.800 --> 01:54:54.240
spirit you could possibly have. Gaming kitsune. Strony, I need you to stop my face more than

01:54:54.240 --> 01:54:59.920
I need to breathe. So, please, smother me. Repeat. I'm going to end up killing you guys by accident.

01:54:59.920 --> 01:55:08.560
So, basically, so, basically, I realized I was in the full game. I looked back on my phone at the

01:55:08.560 --> 01:55:12.320
screen and was further back in the stream. So, I thought we had another game, but it was just,

01:55:13.120 --> 01:55:22.000
I wasn't watching you live. Was that English? Good luck. What? What are you talking about?

01:55:22.800 --> 01:55:31.360
No. She was behind on stream. So, you thought it was, right. So, I was behind on stream. Right.

01:55:31.360 --> 01:55:39.040
Okay. On the last race. Right. And what, and you ditched? Right. I'm on the red team now.

01:55:39.440 --> 01:55:49.920
Okay. Oops. I'm on the sand, but that kind of works.

01:55:52.400 --> 01:55:58.800
Okay. Come on, red team. Do it. I'll beat the blue ones up back here. Don't worry. I'll handle these

01:55:58.800 --> 01:56:08.160
reeflings. They're all getting smothered one by one. It's so ugly. No, not sin being gone.

01:56:08.160 --> 01:56:10.320
Now I'm last place all over again, bro.

01:56:13.280 --> 01:56:18.960
Diabolical. Diabolical. What are these wheels as well?

01:56:28.880 --> 01:56:31.360
Oh my god. I'm trying so hard. You have no idea.

01:56:31.760 --> 01:56:39.840
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I think you're a teammate. I just sandbagged myself.

01:56:41.760 --> 01:56:47.440
Why is it when I do so good? I like completely mess it up. Whoa. You almost touched me, Luigi.

01:56:48.160 --> 01:56:53.360
That felt personal. That felt personal. I'm not the one. That felt personal.

01:56:53.520 --> 01:57:00.720
Mm-hmm. I'm aware. I'm aware of what you've done. I like that noise.

01:57:03.360 --> 01:57:09.600
Okay. Okay. I'm not last. I'm not last. I'm not letting my team down. Hold on.

01:57:11.680 --> 01:57:17.680
Okay. I'm gonna, yeah, fuck you for one. You're next if you touch me. Do you understand?

01:57:18.400 --> 01:57:26.400
Take, yes, if you understand how fucked you are. Shit. Right. No one touch me. No one touch me.

01:57:26.400 --> 01:57:31.600
You're gonna regret it. Yeah, fuck you. You're done. Yeah, but you're done for.

01:57:32.560 --> 01:57:37.600
That's right. That's right. That's right. That's right. Tell them how it is. Tell them how it is.

01:57:37.600 --> 01:57:44.080
Tell them how it is. Tell them how it is. Yep. Yep. Tell them how it is. Wait, how did you?

01:57:44.480 --> 01:57:51.120
Okay. I actually am not letting my team down. I'm actually not letting my team down.

01:57:53.680 --> 01:58:00.240
Nine points? I'll take it. Right. I was in the fourth on the last race, so excuse me. Get on my

01:58:00.240 --> 01:58:07.600
level. Oh, right. Okay. So the game didn't have a fit. Oh, right. Okay. Oh, my God. They need to start

01:58:07.600 --> 01:58:12.480
giving me bullets right before the finish in line, like, all the time, because it's actually

01:58:12.480 --> 01:58:18.800
meaning I'm not last. What have we not played? Have we played Wario's Stadium?

01:58:20.320 --> 01:58:26.560
Well, we'll find out in a minute. Fourth place? That's crazy. Stroni has learned how to cart

01:58:26.560 --> 01:58:33.520
the Mario in one stream. Any Mario of carters? Any cart to Mario's? Right. She literally did

01:58:33.520 --> 01:58:40.800
just get on my level. Why, everyone keep bumping into, who driving these carts? Honestly.

01:58:41.760 --> 01:58:42.640
Shocking behavior.

01:58:51.040 --> 01:58:55.360
Question for those that say mommy is carried by the bullet and not our team. How heavy is

01:58:55.360 --> 01:59:01.280
mommy's cheek? I have no idea. I've not weighed myself in months. I have no idea what my weight is.

01:59:03.040 --> 01:59:07.680
Want to find out? Want to find out, huh? You want to find out in person, Franklin?

01:59:08.400 --> 01:59:15.920
Don't think I won't do it. When other streamers shyly, I push further and further

01:59:16.640 --> 01:59:21.760
to the inappropriate level. Oh, no, I messed up the start, right? Bruh, I'm too busy,

01:59:21.760 --> 01:59:28.320
six and to fucking focus on the game. Hold on. Okay, okay, focus up, focus up. Come on.

01:59:30.080 --> 01:59:33.840
I would do the, I would do the anime voice again, but I'm not gonna lie. That really hurt my throat.

01:59:34.560 --> 01:59:37.680
Not the mud, not the mud, but someone please think of the mud.

01:59:42.640 --> 01:59:48.320
Oh, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch. The ring of fire and it.

01:59:53.360 --> 01:59:59.760
Keep going, teammates. I believe in you. Go on without me. I'll be fine.

02:00:00.640 --> 02:00:06.080
I am messing up so badly. Don't tell the red team. I am absolutely

02:00:06.880 --> 02:00:13.120
just decimating any semblance of success for them. Don't tell them though. They don't need to know.

02:00:13.920 --> 02:00:17.680
They don't need to know, okay? They don't need to know. It's fine. They don't need to know.

02:00:19.280 --> 02:00:24.560
Oh my god, right, okay. I'm safe for a little bit in case anyone wants to use anything against me.

02:00:24.560 --> 02:00:27.520
Oh my god, we did a flip though. Oh, we did a flip though.

02:00:31.200 --> 02:00:37.360
Okay, I'm still a living place, so it's not looking that good. I'm gonna be honest.

02:00:37.360 --> 02:00:44.800
It could look better. It could look a lot better right now. Okay, let's not, okay.

02:00:48.000 --> 02:00:51.840
Oh, look, I was fourth place last time. It's fine. I was fourth place last time.

02:00:52.080 --> 02:00:56.240
It truly is fine. Hold on. Let me grab these and then Priya get a bullet.

02:00:56.240 --> 02:01:00.640
Give me two bullets in a row if you love me. Thank you. Thank you. The game loves me.

02:01:01.760 --> 02:01:07.200
I love you too, game. Right, ruin. I'm literally coming for you. I am literally going in front

02:01:07.200 --> 02:01:13.760
of your ruin. You are literally my opposition. What is this? I don't want to attack my teammates.

02:01:14.480 --> 02:01:16.080
Oh, fuck it.

02:01:22.000 --> 02:01:28.720
Well, it worked. I'm ninth place now. Look, it was tactical sabotage. It was tactical sabotage,

02:01:28.720 --> 02:01:35.440
okay? It was tactical. It was tactical. There was a point. Speaking of sabotage,

02:01:35.440 --> 02:01:40.000
by the Beastie Boys. No way he got in front of me.

02:01:42.800 --> 02:01:47.040
No, I messed that up so badly. I think I could have done a lot better.

02:01:49.840 --> 02:01:54.560
Come on. Oh, my God, it sounded like one of those chickens that you're squeaking and out.

02:01:57.520 --> 02:02:02.320
You know those chickens that dogs play with? Those like plastic things? Do you know what I mean?

02:02:05.760 --> 02:02:14.880
Are we winning? Oh, we're winning. The rubber chickens. Yeah, literally. Should I do rubber

02:02:14.880 --> 02:02:24.800
chicken ASMR? I don't know. I've just discovered I can kind of make that noise. I went strolling

02:02:24.800 --> 02:02:33.840
to make the noises too. It's so accurate. You're going to lift me. Have we done sweet canyon? You

02:02:33.840 --> 02:02:38.880
don't need the rubber chicken. You are the rubber chicken. Girlfriend, rubber chicken ASMR should

02:02:38.880 --> 02:02:54.960
sleep. I've just discovered I can kind of make that noise. Oh, my God. Hydration check.

02:02:55.680 --> 02:03:04.160
We're doing it. This is how she distracts the other team. Yes, close your ears, my teammates.

02:03:04.160 --> 02:03:09.680
I'm going to distract them. Are you going to be a good boy for me? Are you going to let me go

02:03:09.680 --> 02:03:18.960
in front? Don't you not want to see the view from behind, little wreathling? Don't you want to see

02:03:18.960 --> 02:03:29.280
it all? If you're in front of me, how can you see me? Come on, wreathling, for me. Just for me.

02:03:33.920 --> 02:03:43.520
Let mommy be first. Did I work? Did I work? Come on, red team. Filter in, please. Oh,

02:03:43.520 --> 02:03:59.920
no, I messed up. What is this map? There's a lot of bumping. I see a lot of bumping. Not going

02:03:59.920 --> 02:04:07.520
to lie. I'm getting bumped to smithereens right now. Maybe that should be my tactic all along.

02:04:07.520 --> 02:04:14.480
Maybe I should just do that. Oh, this is so cool. I like this map. Are we going back in the war?

02:04:15.280 --> 02:04:27.600
Are we going out of the war? I'm sideways. What's a piranha do? Wait, what? I've never had a piranha

02:04:27.600 --> 02:04:43.840
before. How strange. How strange. That was an interesting item, a piranha. They must be super

02:04:43.840 --> 02:04:56.240
rare. Okay, okay. Back to being 12th place. Hold on. I need the bullet, please. Give me a bullet for

02:04:56.240 --> 02:05:07.680
my Valentine's at the Mario Kart battle pass. I just shit on my ass and I bootied up my PC

02:05:07.680 --> 02:05:17.520
because I need mood to get that Fortnite battle pass. Again, I messed. What am I doing so wrong?

02:05:18.080 --> 02:05:25.920
I tried so hard, but in the end, it probably isn't going to matter, but I'm trying. I'm 9th

02:05:25.920 --> 02:05:31.280
place. I'll take it. I'm 9th place. This is the best I've done and however long. Right, okay,

02:05:31.280 --> 02:05:39.760
it's fine. I just don't want to be last. Oh my god, there's a bullet. Stop it. You're such

02:05:39.760 --> 02:05:45.760
bullies, reflinges. You're supposed to let me win. What do you mean my voice isn't safe? Say what

02:05:45.760 --> 02:05:53.520
I'm fucking angry. Reflings, let me win. Fuck take. Let me win. Let me win. Let me win. Sorry,

02:05:53.520 --> 02:05:58.080
but let me win. It's actually, it's literally by a ball here. Right, I'm passing. I passed the blue,

02:05:58.080 --> 02:06:04.400
so I'm winning. Stop putting bananas on the track. The bananas go in marshmallow. I'm not on the track.

02:06:05.680 --> 02:06:11.120
Oh my god. I actually want to win so badly. No, I don't want to hurt my teammate.

02:06:12.080 --> 02:06:20.320
I'm literally 12th place. Bro, I'm literally an anchor. I'm literally an anchor. I'm getting

02:06:20.320 --> 02:06:28.240
did not finish. I'm that. Oh, I'm an anchor. Are we winning? Oh my god, I'm such an anchor.

02:06:30.080 --> 02:06:36.800
What is it? Oh my god, we're still somehow doing it. I don't know, but we're still somehow doing it.

02:06:37.360 --> 02:06:43.840
Oh my god, clutched three. I did not clutch. I was third and got hit by a hundred items,

02:06:43.840 --> 02:06:49.760
so now I'm 7th. You literally kept me from starting that right. Oh my god, I'm getting annihilated.

02:06:51.200 --> 02:06:56.800
I've been Mario circuit. Oh, shaggle falls. That's cute.

02:06:59.600 --> 02:07:03.200
The red carry is crazy. Literally the only way I'm going to win this game

02:07:04.160 --> 02:07:08.720
is by one, sorting into teams, and then two, getting carried by those team members.

02:07:09.760 --> 02:07:14.240
A fun idea. Make it a challenge. Whoever are the third, three people that finish behind

02:07:14.240 --> 02:07:19.920
Strony are considered first, second, and third. No, it's not going to work like that. There's no way.

02:07:25.440 --> 02:07:31.440
KK9's back must be hurting a lot by now. We are winning, at least I'm faster than a fish woman.

02:07:31.440 --> 02:07:36.400
How dare you? I'm literally so good at swimming. I'm not being funny. You put me in a water game

02:07:36.400 --> 02:07:42.960
with you right now. Is there a multiplayer shark game where one team is like the sharks and the

02:07:42.960 --> 02:07:48.080
others are the divers? I'm going to need to look into it. Maybe we can play that as a streamstank

02:07:48.080 --> 02:07:59.040
game. I'm a really good swimmer. I want to take up swimming again, actually. Okay, well, I messed

02:07:59.200 --> 02:08:08.400
up already. It's fine. I didn't want to be first place anyway. No, no, I'm not taking it personally.

02:08:09.280 --> 02:08:14.720
Oh, you can fall off the map in this road. Okay, I'm going to be a Sunday driver

02:08:17.120 --> 02:08:23.360
because I didn't... Are we on a space station? You know, the maps are getting a bit extreme,

02:08:23.440 --> 02:08:30.480
map that I've met. A bit extreme for my liking, you know. Oh, we did a little stun pose. Yeah,

02:08:34.080 --> 02:08:39.040
this map is crazy. Yeah, fuck you. I'm going for a knee. Sorry, your team blue. Get right team

02:08:39.040 --> 02:08:46.720
blue. No, no, no. Yes. No, not the red though. Not the red though. So much for auto turning.

02:08:46.720 --> 02:08:51.680
The game said, no, you're not getting it. Okay, that was so lucky that little bump pad thing was

02:08:51.680 --> 02:09:00.400
there or I was a goner. I'm not going to lie. My steering is terrible. I got saved by bumping into

02:09:00.400 --> 02:09:14.480
that. What is he holding? I'm so scared to go past him. Okay, can I even... I can? Oh, right. Oh,

02:09:14.480 --> 02:09:19.120
right. Hold on a minute. Oh my god, both me and Roon are actually trashed. Sorry, Roon, to pick on

02:09:19.120 --> 02:09:24.640
you, but literally both me and you are doing the exact same mistake. Right, hold on. All right, okay,

02:09:24.640 --> 02:09:29.120
okay, okay, okay, okay. Okay, okay, okay. Let's do it. Let's do it. Let's do it. Let's do it.

02:09:31.040 --> 02:09:34.560
Oh my god, right. As long as I'm in front of Roon and sauce, but you're actually my competitor.

02:09:34.560 --> 02:09:42.000
No, no, he got a bullet. He got a bullet. Why did I not get a bullet? Oh my god, this map is so hard

02:09:42.080 --> 02:09:52.080
for no reason. I'm stuck. Okay, right. No, it's fine. I didn't want to be... I don't want to rank

02:09:52.080 --> 02:09:57.280
anyway. I didn't even want to finish this map. Of course I want to do not finish. Did not finish,

02:09:57.280 --> 02:10:05.120
bro. Bro, please give me another bullet. I need all the help I can get. Are you serious?

02:10:06.080 --> 02:10:12.480
No, I can't use this one on this map. Breastrokes with Strony.

02:10:16.480 --> 02:10:23.680
Sorry, this map. I'm so sorry, teammates. I hope you're carrying. This map is impossible. I can't

02:10:23.680 --> 02:10:32.400
do it. I honestly can't do it. My freaking baby mobile is just... Bro, it's no happening.

02:10:32.720 --> 02:10:35.520
Yeah, I need two bullets, please.

02:10:37.840 --> 02:10:45.520
I've got one, and then I'm going to lightening everyone. Sorry if I just got you, but you're

02:10:45.520 --> 02:10:51.040
getting annihilated. Wait, I've got another bullet. Maybe I can become 11. Maybe I can do 11th

02:10:51.040 --> 02:10:59.120
place. That's right, bro. Suck it. Suck it, bro. Take it. Take it like a giveaway fun. I'm not

02:10:59.840 --> 02:11:04.320
Did we win? Oh my god, it's so close. Did we win?

02:11:07.760 --> 02:11:08.480
Did we win?

02:11:11.280 --> 02:11:13.280
Did we win? Is there one more?

02:11:15.920 --> 02:11:26.000
Oh my god, we won! We won! Yay! Thank you, teammates. Thank you, KK9Grey, Dreal, Yoshi, Feathers,

02:11:26.080 --> 02:11:29.040
Diablo. We did it! We actually won!

02:11:31.360 --> 02:11:35.600
This game, I was getting more mushrooms than the Navali or Maros.

02:11:36.720 --> 02:11:43.280
Are you okay, Brian? Oh my god, Brian. Are you okay? He really struggled. Oh my god, the only time

02:11:43.280 --> 02:11:54.320
I win is by cheating. Thank you, Reeflings. Thank you, Anonymous. Wait, I'm going to get Brian to

02:11:54.320 --> 02:11:58.080
replay that because I don't know why he said it like that. He was really not feeling it.

02:11:59.520 --> 02:12:04.960
Are you squiddling right now? Are you trying again, Brian? This damn game, I was getting more

02:12:04.960 --> 02:12:11.200
mushrooms than the Navali or Maros. The Navali or Maros? Thank you, Brian. Thank you, Anonymous,

02:12:11.200 --> 02:12:17.520
for the tip. True, real 4K. I'm really literally greeting right now. I'll literally beat you up.

02:12:17.520 --> 02:12:23.120
I'm so sorry. I got the least amount of points, but at least Momay is happy. Yeah, I'll get you

02:12:23.120 --> 02:12:29.200
next time. Wait, how did you do that animation? How did I do that? I'll get you next time.

02:12:30.320 --> 02:12:37.120
I'll get you next time. That's so unfair. I'll get you next time. I'll get you next time. I'll

02:12:37.120 --> 02:12:43.200
like that. Never happier to be being also the game you ask is the one called Truck Versus Divers

02:12:43.200 --> 02:12:49.840
and the game is called Depps. Oh, we might look into that. Velo Marios. Honestly, my first

02:12:49.920 --> 02:12:55.520
time playing, I don't care if I win or lose. That was so good. That was literally so good.

02:12:55.520 --> 02:13:00.000
I'm so happy with that ending. Literally, I lose the entire time, but right at the end,

02:13:00.000 --> 02:13:06.320
refling, clutch it up for me feels good, Mom. Don't mean to fudge you. Don't mean to fudge you.

02:13:06.320 --> 02:13:15.600
Right, where's my customization? Who's streaming? Is Emmy? Oh, AC's live still? Okay, we're going

02:13:15.600 --> 02:13:22.000
to redirect into AC. I never get this opportunity. Okay, we're redirecting into AC. Get ready for a

02:13:22.000 --> 02:13:27.840
party because she's doing karaoke. Thank you again so much, Reflings, for hanging out with me. You

02:13:27.840 --> 02:13:40.240
get one big wet water kiss, okay? You like that, didn't you? I did my best. Good refling. Okay,

02:13:40.240 --> 02:13:44.640
I see you, Giffy Gibbers, tomorrow for crying stream. Apparently, we're just crying tomorrow,

02:13:44.640 --> 02:13:48.560
so yay, we have fun at that. Okay, bye-bye, Reflings, kiss, kiss,

02:13:50.000 --> 02:13:57.920
enjoy ACiCle. We never get to read into ACiCle. AC time, AC time.
