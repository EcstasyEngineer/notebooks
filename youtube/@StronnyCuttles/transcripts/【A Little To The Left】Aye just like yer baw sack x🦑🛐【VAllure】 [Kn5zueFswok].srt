1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
mom oh I'm so tiny

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
yeah a little bit

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:25,000
my baby don't mess around because there's something else and then she told me so

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
black cats and then and then

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,000
but I know for sure

8
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,000
oh oh sorry you just caught me

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,000
warming up for my future karaoke stream

10
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
oh no I'm so embarrassed

11
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
I can't believe you caught me like that

12
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
oh um good morning

13
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
good evening and uh good afternoon

14
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
who's that going? who's that going?

15
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:03,000
on 4k bro

16
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
as if I didn't orchestrate that bye bye

17
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,000
okay she's in the ash kitchen voice again

18
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
hiya America hiya

19
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
good morning

20
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
uh I haven't add in front of the stream

21
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:27,000
no you shouldn't have I've told YouTube not to do this specifically

22
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
that's not right hold on hold it

23
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
fucking monetization

24
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,000
choose when mid rolls appear insert them manually

25
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
YouTube's taking the piss

26
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,000
because I haven't put ads on I don't put ads on on live streams

27
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,000
are they forcing ads on live streams there?

28
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
they better not be I'm gonna fart

29
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
I'm gonna do it okay

30
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
I get ads on my phone

31
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
um that'll be YouTube pocket in the full ad then

32
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
what did I just walk into?

33
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
I don't know

34
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,000
please don't think about me like that

35
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
okay got a bit of an update

36
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Mercy's emotes approved I'm just waiting for the delivery so they could be thingied

37
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
there was two mistakes with Azur's emotes

38
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:21,000
so I had to pay an extra couple of dollars do's

39
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
but the sneaky little sneaker tins

40
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:29,000
they extended the delivery time by three weeks to fix two emotes

41
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,000
and they already have taken quite a while

42
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:37,000
so I need to wait until Mercy and Azur's batch of 10 are done

43
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:41,000
before I can order everyone else's missing slot emotes

44
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
is that my sense?

45
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
so I can't do anything yet

46
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
my hands are tied

47
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
my hands are tied okay

48
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
but not to be confused my hand can't

49
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
okay as for the updates again

50
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
bleeding hearts, reflins, both the user in the same club

51
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
I'll need to sleep after the stream

52
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
and then I will get the third audio up

53
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:05,000
my audio is beam of fur babacucation

54
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:11,000
and Azur's is landlord lips never felt so okay

55
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
who wrote that? it was me at the time

56
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
it was absolutely outrageous behaviour

57
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:21,000
honestly outrageous

58
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:25,000
is that doom music playing in the background?

59
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
but I hope not

60
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
there shouldn't be any music playing in the background

61
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
this is what plays in the background

62
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
but it's a bit sad

63
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
but anyway

64
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
got an update

65
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
me dad

66
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
me dad's officially

67
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
fucked off

68
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
nah it's true, papacuttle's is heading home

69
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
so

70
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
now I do have two more streams of shorter games

71
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
just so I can catch up on the ASMR I need to record

72
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:59,000
because I need to record about 3 hours worth of shit I'm missing

73
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
but the good news is

74
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
it lets me catch up on all my work

75
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,000
now I do have a message for your reflins

76
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
but I can't read it yet or I'm gonna cry

77
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
so I'll read it tomorrow

78
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
I can't read it today

79
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
or I'll greet my eyes out

80
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
I miss pap already

81
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
aww I miss him too I was so sad

82
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
both of us were like

83
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
I was like I didn't want to cry in front of him

84
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
as he was going

85
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
so I was like

86
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
so there's this fucking meme for this stupid thing

87
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
I don't know what it is

88
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
but the meme goes

89
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
be strong, Clarence be strong for mama

90
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,000
and that's what goes in my head

91
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
when I try and tell myself not to laugh

92
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
not to cry sorry

93
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
like to try and cheer me up

94
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
I can't remember what the meme is

95
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
but it's like be strong, Clarence be strong for mama

96
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
so he didn't see me cry

97
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
but as soon as like

98
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
I couldn't see him anymore

99
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
oh god I'm getting emotional

100
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,000
ok we're playing a little to the left today

101
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
which is a puzzle game ok

102
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
now as well no puzzle game

103
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
so it's my biggest enemy

104
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
because it requires IQ

105
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
that I do not possess

106
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
in any way shape or form

107
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
thank you GothMommyBee

108
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
for becoming a member

109
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
enjoy those emotions

110
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
I have four more on the way

111
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
I think there's four more slots

112
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
bye strong

113
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
be strong for the refling

114
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
it's a TISM game

115
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
oh god

116
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
isn't that a dodo meme

117
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
it's a pokemon meme

118
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
it's like a mash of a dodo

119
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
one of the dodo birds

120
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
it's wrong

121
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
yes oh my god you know it

122
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000

154
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000

so that's the truth but yeah

169
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000

170
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000

171
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000

00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
the good thing is it gives me frost resistance

191
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
so it's not bad

192
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
if you would like

193
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
to consider yourself

194
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
an enjoyer of me

195
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
you can refer to yourself

196
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
as a replay

197
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
or replay

198
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
when you came and you gave me a

199
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
kiss

200
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
I reached a round

201
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
and

202
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
you got a thousand dollar dono

203
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
what about Emmy's 400 dono

204
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
it's getting clipped and shipped

205
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
it's already been sent for editing purposes

206
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
so

207
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
identify as an ord

208
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
I am translucent with how pale I am

209
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
you can see my entire vascular

210
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
system at a glance

211
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
that's how pale I am

212
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
I literally have hues

213
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
of purple and blue thanks to

214
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
my veins that I am that pale

215
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
so I would consider myself a

216
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Nord and the name of the Nord

217
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
I pray to the Lord you all get a taste

218
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
of my blade and my sword I'm taking on

219
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
what's that Emmy's

220
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
purple yes if you

221
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
have very translucent skin

222
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
veins can appear purple and I have

223
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
very almost purple esk under

224
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
my eyeballs and relay which means I'm

225
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
perfect for being a girl

226
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
oh my god that was a voice crack

227
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
voice crack

228
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
also we saw the ring fit stream

229
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
I assume you haven't seen sunlight in years how

230
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
dare you

231
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
he spoke nothing but the truth I'm

232
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
insulted by such words

233
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
and yet no true words were spoken in that

234
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
moment my goodness

235
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
you could probably put it to scripture that's

236
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
so truthful he was being in that moment

237
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
aww absolutely annihilated

238
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
honestly sun gets reflect

239
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
I can't go outside without fully closed

240
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
it'll be like

241
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
well it's winter right now so it doesn't

242
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
wait what's next

243
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
my wires

244
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
sorry if I seem like

245
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
fucking hyper I'm like

246
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
super sad inside but I'm really glad I get to

247
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
talk to you Evelyn I'd be a puddle

248
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
right now and I just

249
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
thought this game was gonna go shite because

250
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
it's a fucking puzzle game

251
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
it requires IQ

252
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
the beacons are lit have you slept

253
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
so I

254
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
stayed up last night

255
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
writing scripts for the girls

256
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
so

257
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
AC has a script

258
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
about scratching your back

259
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
because obviously she's a polar bear and she's got

260
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
claws right so

261
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
I

262
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
wrote a script about AC that she gives you like back

263
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
scratches in the middle of the night and she has

264
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
her sleepy voice on okay

265
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
and then I wrote one for

266
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Mercy where it's Yandere

267
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
it gives you a haircut while she's tied you up

268
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
in your bed ASMR

269
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
it's the most bizarre thing I've ever written in my life

270
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
are you squiddin me right now

271
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
I'm fucking giggling away at myself over it

272
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
and then Azura's is a

273
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
dummy mummy

274
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
praises you in your sleep

275
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
ASMR I've not finished Azura's

276
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
but I'm about to

277
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
but I sent it to Mercy and Mercy's like oh

278
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
I actually wrote some stuff for myself

279
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
and then Azura was like oh I actually

280
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
got some stuff to do YouTube ASMR

281
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
with and I'm like

282
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
my daughters don't even need me

283
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
I'm being outsourced already

284
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Tim Schottel thank you for the tip

285
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
love the new short your open book

286
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
just as open as my legs baby

287
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
well I tried

288
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
and it's very interesting to see the things

289
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
that people don't share you are amazing

290
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
thank you I appreciate it

291
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
yeah I

292
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
personally I have

293
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
problems being like this is what it looks like

294
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
behind the scenes because I think a lot of people

295
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
don't get the opportunity to really see

296
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
that which is why I want to be like

297
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
hey we might be a small

298
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
agency but I did put a bit

299
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
of thought behind you know

300
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
gets an exchange of services and

301
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
trying to earn my money you know

302
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
I might be shocking

303
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
but mummy

304
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
what is bigger your first month's paycheck

305
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000

306
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
long what

307
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
I don't

308
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
I mean I'm technically

309
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
five inches

310
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
what is that

311
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
they're all grown up outsourced in the first

312
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
month honestly

313
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
I've got a collab with AC and Emmy

314
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
to write but so there's one

315
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
on Emmy's channel of her and AC

316
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
but I need to do it the other way

317
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
around and I think I want to do it

318
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
like Bratz give you a haircut

319
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
because I need to record new haircut sounds

320
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000

321
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
what I'm so sorry that was my accent

322
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000

323
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
thank you for becoming a member I'm so sorry

324
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
I said piss in your name there's not it's just

325
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
I just can't read properly

326
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
I'm so sorry I think I might do like

327
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
two Bratz cut your hair in the middle of the

328
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
night for Emmy and AC and they're whispering

329
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
to themselves about how mischievous

330
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
they both are and then you just get like

331
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
back like over the cheek

332
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
and then like kind of like the midnight

333
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
barber mean for the mighty bush if you've

334
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
ever seen that it's about a British

335
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
comedy yeah

336
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
but it's got to be

337
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
those units don't compare

338
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
you know what compares

339
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
me and you

340
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000

00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
we missed up we gotta go but oh that's how I

342
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
should end it oh shit we missed up

343
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
we gotta go

344
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
I think strongy call me

346
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
just say I just don't make it easy

347
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
oh my god can't believe you're not making it

348
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
easy for me

349
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
this is

350
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
this is my time joining a violer stream and I know this

351
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
is adult agency and I mean

352
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
very adult by adult I mean jerking my

353
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
pintas but I'm curious on whether or not

354
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
it's a nice and welcoming community as well

355
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
as the others yes it's

356
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
a misconception that we are literally

357
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
humping the screen 24-7 on youtube

358
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
nope that's that's not what we are

359
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
however I do love challenging

360
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
a bit of a misconception anyway

396
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
and unfortunately I'm Scottish

397
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
it's the best I got

398
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
it's the best I got

399
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
right I'm gonna finish my honey tea and then we're gonna do

400
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
a little to the left

401
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
and then after that

402
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
hmm

403
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
I like this funny creature

404
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
this creature amuses me

405
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
you mean fortunately you're Scottish

406
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
I SHITE ME IN SCHOOL

407
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
yeah yes uh membership streams

408
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
also start up

409
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
not gonna lie

410
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
being addicted to league is a huge deal

411
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
like everyone needs a weakness

412
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
my weakness is like I'm literally

413
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
I'm not allowed to say that cause it will

414
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
worry you guys

415
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
I'm not allowed to say that

416
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
being British is your weakness

417
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
no that's probably what it is

418
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
I get considered British cause technically

419
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
you know United Kingdom, Scotland

420
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
however

421
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
however

422
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
yes

423
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
I'm not gonna lie

424
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
first agency I liked all the members

425
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
and I actually sit through the streams

426
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
so

427
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
obviously

428
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
the girls are free to discuss their PL

429
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
stuff but I've kinda said this

430
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
like everyone got picked cause I saw a bit

431
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
of myself in them

432
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
and I have a bias for the underdog

433
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
I don't give a shit

434
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
if you think that's a bad whatever

435
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
I like the underdog

436
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
obviously the only exception is kinda

437
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
me the Emmy if you want to get

438
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
takey spaky

439
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
but Emmy

440
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
Emmy

441
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
was I've said this before

442
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
Emmy was quite inquisitive during the interview stage

443
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
and she was like

444
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
asking how it would work behind the scenes

445
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
and she was very keen to start on something new

446
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
and I can completely

447
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
relate on a personal level

448
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
of being like I don't wanna do this shit

449
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
no more on my own like fuck it let's

450
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
let's do it

451
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
so yeah

452
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
this is definitely a yapping corporal on that

453
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
right and he gets started with the game

454
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
I have no idea how long this game takes

455
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
I am going to aim for like a two hour stream

456
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
and then I'll read

457
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
oh she be

458
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
okay I can't read it right

459
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
into she be

460
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
here I will admit I do miss the bunny

461
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
the bunny's coming home

462
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
she's coming to my house

463
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
and I'm coming all I'm sorry I'm not

464
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000

465
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000

we burp a lot all of us pretty much burp a lot

467
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
uh Azura should have

468
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
a new short up about burping if I'm not mistaken

469
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
hold on Azura Duley

470
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
I spent a ridiculous amount of money on the shorts

471
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
oh there it is

472
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000

wait hold on let me

474
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Azura got four shorts

475
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
and they finally came

476
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
they came we sent them

477
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
to an editor right

478
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
and then the editor went AFK for two weeks

479
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
so we had to send it to a new editor

480
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
and the new editor was like give us five days

481
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000

00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000

705
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,000
three and twelve nine

706
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,000
one two three

707
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,000
four five six seven eight nine

708
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,000

oh no there's tons

716
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,000
how am I supposed to do this via logic

717
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,000
right the difference between one and ten

718
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,000
is nine so

719
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,000
nineteen

720
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,000
and then nineteen plus nine is

721
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,000
twenty eight

722
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,000
one two three four five six seven eight nine

723
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,000
okay and then

724
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,000
the red one is first

725
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,000
and the blue one is nice

726
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,000
the flower thirteen

727
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,000
take away four is

728
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,000
nine again

729
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,000
uh nine and thirteen

730
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,000
together make

731
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,000
twenty two

732
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,000
okay

733
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,000
and then

734
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,000
five comes after the

735
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,000
flower

736
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,000
okay okay don't hurt him now

737
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,000
and then after the flower is the yellow

738
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,000
don't hurt him now

739
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,000
don't hurt him with that logic now

740
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,000
don't don't hurt him now right and then

741
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,000
a gap between the yellow

742
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,000
and then it's the petal

743
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,000
gap between the yellow

744
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,000
oh my god I love that

745
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,000

oh my god

747
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,000
there's a fake sign to start a sign when doing it

748
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,000
correctly

749
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,000
is this hate

750
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,000
or am I making a picture

751
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,000

752
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,000

753
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,000

let him get up let him get up

757
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,000
let him get up

758
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,000
uh huh uh huh

759
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,000
yeah

760
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,000
yep yep yep yep

761
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,000
okay that's not the answer

762
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,000
but that's okay

763
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,000
what happens if we did it

764
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,000
if we put

765
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,000
even Steven on the outside

766
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,000
going in

767
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,000
because then that middle book isn't odd

768
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,000
because it'll go in the middle because there's only one of it

769
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,000
oh

770
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,000
oh this is actually not a bad game

771
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,000
are you squeaking me right now

772
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,000

00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,000
alright

774
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,000
we just don't love me

775
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,000
if I had a wrinkly brain

776
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,000
thank you Kaidon for the super chat

777
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,000

778
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,000

00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,000

782
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,000

783
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,000

785
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,000

786
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,000
I did it

787
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,000
I did it

788
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,000
oh my god wait a minute

789
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,000
I remember Vivi said

790
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,000
she didn't like this game

791
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,000
I got worried

792
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,000

793
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,000

795
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,000

00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,000
look

797
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,000

798
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,000

that you're doing the right thing

802
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,000

803
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,000

don't worry I've always been chilling

923
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,000
and the endurance streams come back

924
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,000
later in the week

925
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,000
and then we're going straight back into it

926
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,000
okay so please don't worry

927
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,000

00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,000
yah

931
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,000
try to figure out how you're supposed to do it any other way

932
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,000
but

933
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,000
use boom boom right

934
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,000
oh my god we learned how

935
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,000
to do our own

936
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,000
home

937
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,000
pickle in

938
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,000
even though it's super dangerous

939
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,000
I'd probably kill a little bit

940
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,000
juice levels

941
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,000
oh there's three different ways you can do that

942
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,000
probably the height and then

943
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,000
the number of stuff in the jar

944
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,000
yeah

945
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,000
spoon

946
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,000
the lorry

947
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,000
spoon

948
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,000
let's do it by measuring

949
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,000
oh this is so cute

950
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,000

951
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,000
no

952
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,000

I did it

1173
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:15,000
I couldn't verbalize anything

1174
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:17,000
I was doing it right there

1175
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:19,000
or else I wouldn't have been able to do it

1176
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:21,000
so I'm sorry that was just me going

1177
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:23,000
honestly if the make didn't have a filler

1178
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:25,000

1179
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:27,000
oh wait hold on let me meet the game

1180
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:29,000
just so you can really get the full effect

1181
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:33,000
because that's how I think

1182
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:35,000
I can't verbalize it or it's not gonna work

1183
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:39,000

00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:41,000

1187
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:51,000
to break in there

1188
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:53,000
she is trying to break in at my room

1189
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:59,000
Gimli

1190
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:03,000

00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:05,000

1193
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:09,000
oh my god I'm screaming at my cat

1194
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:11,000
and she's not even doing anything

1195
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:13,000
okay it's the in-game audio

1196
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:15,000
that weird noise you hear

1197
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:19,000
let's push this

1198
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:29,000
oh my god I thought I literally thought

1199
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:31,000
the cat's name is Gimli

1200
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:33,000
Gimli's got a bit of ginger on her

1201
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:35,000
so I named her Gimli

1202
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:37,000
and then when I pick, well

1203
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:39,000
I've actually started to pick her up a little bit

1204
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:41,000
which is something too bad

1205
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:43,000
and I couldn't go that's my weird loud Gimli

1206
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:47,000
they actually did really well

1207
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:49,000
when my dad was visiting

1208
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:51,000
both Gimli and Vigo

1209
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:53,000

A little bit of monocled

1305
00:58:42,520 --> 00:58:44,680
A little bit of it is all I need

1306
00:58:46,520 --> 00:58:48,520
What the fuck is this?

1307
00:58:50,920 --> 00:58:53,320
Oh no, hold on a minute

00:59:07,800 --> 00:59:14,920
Or is this supposed to be a secret and it's not really that hate so it doesn't get to go there

1312
00:59:20,200 --> 00:59:22,200
Yeah

1313
00:59:24,600 --> 00:59:26,600
Okay, mm-hmm

1314
00:59:27,480 --> 00:59:33,000
Okay, mm-hmm. Yeah, okay. I'm starting to understand why people hate this game. Okay. What do you want from me?

1315
00:59:33,800 --> 00:59:36,600
Is this the content? What the fuck?

1316
00:59:38,040 --> 00:59:40,120
Who or what are you spitting at the puzzle?

1317
00:59:41,640 --> 00:59:43,640
What?

1318
00:59:43,640 --> 00:59:45,640
What do you want from me?

1319
00:59:45,640 --> 00:59:47,640
You want to kiss me?

1320
00:59:49,240 --> 00:59:51,240

Just move it a little to the left. You know what?

1325
01:00:04,920 --> 01:00:11,240
You know what? You know what? You're the first to get our word in the train. Sorry. I really shouldn't make

1326
01:00:12,280 --> 01:00:16,040
And yet I do what happens. What happens? I don't know

1327
01:00:17,800 --> 01:00:21,160
What are you? What are you saying?

1328
01:00:21,880 --> 01:00:23,880
Right, hold on. Let's go

1329
01:00:24,120 --> 01:00:25,640
Let's do wit

1330
01:00:25,640 --> 01:00:27,640
Again, the milk is the wittiest boy

1331
01:00:28,280 --> 01:00:30,840
Right, you're skinny melinky long legs. So don't

1332
01:00:31,640 --> 01:00:33,640
Right, let's do witt

1333
01:00:50,120 --> 01:00:52,120
Um

1334
01:00:58,040 --> 01:01:05,240
I'm stumped. I don't know what it is. Uh, something about the colors

1335
01:01:06,040 --> 01:01:08,040
Okay, let's okay

1336
01:01:08,600 --> 01:01:10,600
Something about the colors

1337
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:18,760
Colors, uh, love them. I'm not colorblind. Lucky me. Uh, yellow

1338
01:01:19,640 --> 01:01:21,640
Oh

1339
01:01:24,520 --> 01:01:28,440
Something about the colors

1340
01:01:38,120 --> 01:01:40,120
Um

1341
01:01:40,120 --> 01:01:42,120
Oh

1342
01:01:47,720 --> 01:01:52,760
What what are you asking for

1343
01:01:56,040 --> 01:01:58,760
I've no go clue colors

1344
01:02:00,200 --> 01:02:08,120
You know last time magic segregation was like way back in the fucking past. What the fuck are we doing sort by colors for?

1345
01:02:10,120 --> 01:02:12,120
What the fuck? I can't figure it out

1346
01:02:15,800 --> 01:02:22,920
Purple right, there's purple here a purple there. Then that's the balsamic fucking piece of shit

1347
01:02:24,200 --> 01:02:26,200
Right, so now what?

1348
01:02:28,120 --> 01:02:30,120
Align the labels

1349
01:02:31,640 --> 01:02:33,640
What they're supposed to fucking kiss

1350
01:02:34,760 --> 01:02:36,760
Where how is that supposed to

1351
01:02:40,440 --> 01:02:42,440
I

1352
01:02:47,880 --> 01:02:54,360
What what even is this laying the labels on my back

1353
01:02:56,760 --> 01:02:59,160
What it's all supposed to like touch or something

1354
01:03:01,400 --> 01:03:04,280
Olive oil next to the milk

1355
01:03:10,360 --> 01:03:12,360
So

1356
01:03:26,440 --> 01:03:29,800
Whatever vv said about this game she was right

1357
01:03:32,120 --> 01:03:34,120
What

1358
01:03:35,320 --> 01:03:37,560
I can see something forming here

1359
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:43,400
I don't think we should all the luck

1360
01:04:01,160 --> 01:04:07,000
I don't even have a brain cell to talk and try and figure this out at the same time. Are we skipped you doodling?

1361
01:04:07,080 --> 01:04:12,680
I think you're overthinking it. Well, how do I open up the menu?

1362
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:29,640
Tubbs and mayonnaise to milk to balsamic

1363
01:04:33,560 --> 01:04:35,960
There's a fucking line there's a hidden line

1364
01:04:37,960 --> 01:04:40,200
Right tub to mayonnaise to milk

1365
01:04:42,600 --> 01:04:44,600
Tub

1366
01:04:45,400 --> 01:04:50,840
To mayonnaise to milk something I already forgot

1367
01:04:58,280 --> 01:05:00,280
Ah

1368
01:05:01,240 --> 01:05:08,280
It's milk to balsamic to thingy to the medium the milk to the stomach

1369
01:05:16,280 --> 01:05:18,280
I still not afraid again

1370
01:05:18,280 --> 01:05:20,280
So

1371
01:05:35,960 --> 01:05:37,960
Space them

1372
01:05:48,280 --> 01:05:50,280
Oh

1373
01:06:04,920 --> 01:06:06,920
Yeah, that's getting a bit too much

1374
01:06:07,400 --> 01:06:12,440
That's getting a bit too much hold on a minute. VV was right. Hashtag VV was right. I'm not even being funny

1375
01:06:13,080 --> 01:06:15,080
Oh

1376
01:06:15,800 --> 01:06:17,800
Are you trying to soften me up after that one?

1377
01:06:19,240 --> 01:06:21,240
pooders

1378
01:06:31,160 --> 01:06:37,160
Any cheesers it's been funny, but I've got a shower. Oh, yeah, the puzzle really got you good

1379
01:06:40,440 --> 01:06:43,080
Oh, okay, right I can tell the story um

1380
01:06:45,640 --> 01:06:54,840
Okay, he has an idea. He wants to spill the drink. Okay. He drops the bath and the drink and plant

1381
01:06:56,520 --> 01:07:01,160
Wait, we're just taking photos of our cat destroying stuff. We're like we're just letting it happen. Um

1382
01:07:06,520 --> 01:07:10,840
Oh, no, it's going downhill. I thought I was doing so well, but my logic isn't

1383
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:12,120
Uh

1384
01:07:12,120 --> 01:07:16,600
The reason the earth is not flat is this cat so didn't knock everything off switch the first

1385
01:07:17,640 --> 01:07:19,640
switch the first

1386
01:07:19,640 --> 01:07:21,640
second

1387
01:07:22,600 --> 01:07:24,600
And throw the round

1388
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:33,500
You guys watch me do it the wrong way

1389
01:07:41,800 --> 01:07:43,800
I

1390
01:07:45,480 --> 01:07:48,040
Wait if I don't every combination but the correct one

1391
01:07:50,360 --> 01:07:53,880
You guys have to look at the drink first and then he gets an idea to knock things over

1392
01:07:54,600 --> 01:07:58,680
Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. He looks at the drink and then he gets a bright idea to knock shit over

1393
01:08:00,360 --> 01:08:02,360
And then he knocks stuff over

1394
01:08:03,160 --> 01:08:05,560
First he sees the glass and then the lamp

1395
01:08:06,520 --> 01:08:10,840
Okay, he sees it and then he gets a bright idea to start knocking stuff over

1396
01:08:12,040 --> 01:08:14,040
Okay, maybe another color puzzle

1397
01:08:17,560 --> 01:08:20,120
Nettie gray, how many chapters are there?

1398
01:08:21,320 --> 01:08:26,840
We're actually kind of get I mean we may actually do this. Hold on a minute. I have a little bit fee

1399
01:08:36,520 --> 01:08:39,480
I spoke far too soon and I'm sorry

1400
01:08:42,120 --> 01:08:44,120
Oh, I see something

1401
01:08:45,960 --> 01:08:50,280
Okay, I see something I see something I see something here

1402
01:08:50,280 --> 01:08:52,280
And this

1403
01:09:01,800 --> 01:09:05,320
There's five chapters I have a little bit of faith sees the next puzzle

1404
01:09:07,400 --> 01:09:09,400
Right these two fit

1405
01:09:10,520 --> 01:09:14,920
Okay, these three fit and the glove fits the fingerprints on that one. So

1406
01:09:16,760 --> 01:09:18,760
Okay, okay, okay

1407
01:09:18,840 --> 01:09:21,480
Okay, it doesn't work. Oh wait, those two work together

1408
01:09:36,600 --> 01:09:39,160
The bucket seems like it has to go there

1409
01:09:42,920 --> 01:09:44,920
Yeah

1410
01:09:49,640 --> 01:09:53,240
No, you can but you bump into him

1411
01:09:57,320 --> 01:10:01,400
All right, everything bumps into the bucket so the bucket has to go at the end

1412
01:10:03,160 --> 01:10:10,360
That is my only logical conclusion the bucket has to go there. Okay, right then we'll figure out what happens over here

1413
01:10:19,640 --> 01:10:21,640
Oh

1414
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:25,000
Wait, what does it look right?

1415
01:10:26,440 --> 01:10:30,840
Everything looks correct other than this one go in the bucket go in the bucket

1416
01:10:32,760 --> 01:10:34,760
Go in the bucket

1417
01:10:37,320 --> 01:10:39,480
I'm cleaning them make them shine

1418
01:10:43,720 --> 01:10:46,680
This looks correct I gone crazy

1419
01:10:49,560 --> 01:10:52,520
This oh the sponge goes in the square space

1420
01:10:59,560 --> 01:11:04,360
Sponges, why are we no longer participating in the laws of physics all of a sudden

1421
01:11:05,240 --> 01:11:10,120
Why is physics just optional now in the game right? I'll need to keep that in mind

1422
01:11:11,080 --> 01:11:13,080
I

1423
01:11:15,080 --> 01:11:19,640
Physics is no optional got a G's right big batteries

1424
01:11:22,680 --> 01:11:24,680
I am speed

1425
01:11:26,040 --> 01:11:28,040
I am speed

1426
01:11:28,120 --> 01:11:30,120
I am speed

1427
01:11:30,680 --> 01:11:32,680
I am speed

1428
01:11:35,880 --> 01:11:37,880
You don't belong here

1429
01:11:41,080 --> 01:11:48,040
You might belong here though. Yeah, that looks correct correct in Mundo

1430
01:11:50,200 --> 01:11:52,600
Nope, you can't all fit in there you're too big

1431
01:11:55,320 --> 01:11:57,320
Okay, okay, okay

1432
01:12:02,040 --> 01:12:04,040
That looks

1433
01:12:10,520 --> 01:12:14,600
I mean them I'm gonna see

1434
01:12:28,600 --> 01:12:31,160
The yellow one on the place of the one

1435
01:12:35,720 --> 01:12:38,220
Thank you for rather violent

1436
01:12:40,440 --> 01:12:42,440
All you want to then

1437
01:12:56,840 --> 01:13:01,560
Okay, this one's cute I like it I like it I dig it I dig it angry sneeze

1438
01:13:02,920 --> 01:13:07,000
It was so loud my screen flickered. That's hilarious

1439
01:13:11,080 --> 01:13:13,480
What's wrong? Oh, that's right

1440
01:13:16,040 --> 01:13:18,040
That is different therefore it's wrong

1441
01:13:18,680 --> 01:13:23,400
Okay, there we go. Oh, it's a good one. Okay. I like that one. I like that one. Let him get up

1442
01:13:23,560 --> 01:13:28,680
Okay, the game might have redeemed itself slightly scream again, please. That was a sneeze

1443
01:13:30,440 --> 01:13:33,400
You've got coins. So this is a 50-pence coin

1444
01:13:40,120 --> 01:13:42,120
Okay

1445
01:13:50,200 --> 01:13:52,840
Go from a circle

1446
01:13:55,320 --> 01:13:57,880
Into a lesser circle over time

1447
01:14:10,360 --> 01:14:15,880
A circle how many sides one two three four five six

1448
01:14:16,760 --> 01:14:20,600
Seven eight nine ten one two three four. Oh you

1449
01:14:22,440 --> 01:14:25,880
Wait one two three four five six seven

1450
01:14:28,760 --> 01:14:35,080
One two three four five six one two three four five six nine

1451
01:14:35,080 --> 01:14:37,080
Ten

1452
01:14:53,640 --> 01:15:00,440
I'm sorry. I'm special needs. Hold on a minute. What I know what I'm trying to do but it's not coming out

1453
01:15:00,840 --> 01:15:02,840
So

1454
01:15:03,160 --> 01:15:06,520
Well, I just did more circling. Oh, they start

1455
01:15:11,320 --> 01:15:13,320
Why would you start

1456
01:15:16,200 --> 01:15:18,200
Why would you start

1457
01:15:19,320 --> 01:15:21,320
Why did you start

1458
01:15:22,120 --> 01:15:24,120
I

1459
01:15:28,600 --> 01:15:30,600
Mean

1460
01:15:30,840 --> 01:15:35,480
I'll take it. She's what that was an accidental discovery

1461
01:15:37,320 --> 01:15:39,320
Let's try that that was the

1462
01:15:44,120 --> 01:15:47,000
Maybe it's better to do the more obtuse items first

1463
01:15:47,400 --> 01:15:50,760
Is that even fit

1464
01:15:53,320 --> 01:15:55,320
That's what she said

1465
01:15:56,760 --> 01:15:59,800
Get it get it because

1466
01:16:02,040 --> 01:16:05,000
No, do the more obscure items you look obscure

1467
01:16:06,360 --> 01:16:10,200
Anything that looks mainly different than the usual getting out

1468
01:16:13,640 --> 01:16:16,040
What even is oh it's a tea infuser

1469
01:16:17,720 --> 01:16:21,240
You put your dry tea in it one chopstick

1470
01:16:25,880 --> 01:16:30,200
Sorry, there's a really good vein and the guy's like I'll have one

1471
01:16:31,880 --> 01:16:33,880
Of your ass or

1472
01:16:37,320 --> 01:16:39,320
No, no, no, no, no, you're not left to be

1473
01:16:40,760 --> 01:16:45,320
Being out here. What? Oh, it's one of those that makes sense

1474
01:16:47,960 --> 01:16:51,880
My god, I you knew it. Oh, you know it. You know it

1475
01:16:53,640 --> 01:16:55,640
Uh

1476
01:16:56,280 --> 01:16:59,640
Wait, is there only like one no, I can't hear it

1477
01:17:04,360 --> 01:17:10,600
Okay, the spoon has to be this one because of this little arch way thing going on I refuse to believe they didn't

1478
01:17:17,160 --> 01:17:23,080
We can oh wait, do the wee ones go together? Oh the wee spoons go there

1479
01:17:31,720 --> 01:17:35,000
Well, all done next round, uh, what

1480
01:17:38,040 --> 01:17:40,040
Anything like fine

1481
01:17:41,640 --> 01:17:43,640
No, this is correct

1482
01:17:47,320 --> 01:17:53,640
If I just shake it the game will surely accept it. Can you stack the red spoons again? They're stacked in a weird order

1483
01:17:55,240 --> 01:17:57,240
Sorry, sorry

1484
01:17:57,720 --> 01:17:59,240
Right just type in

1485
01:17:59,240 --> 01:18:00,840
Rebecca's

1486
01:18:00,840 --> 01:18:02,840
Take away, okay

1487
01:18:03,800 --> 01:18:07,720
And you'll understand you'll understand why I go out there

1488
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:13,000
Because if you've got my accent, would you?

1489
01:18:13,240 --> 01:18:15,240
Wait until you open up

1490
01:18:15,560 --> 01:18:18,040
Today, we're going to pack this customer's order

1491
01:18:19,800 --> 01:18:25,880
They ordered a bit at Becca's munchie belongs. Sorry. The mixer doesn't fit

1492
01:18:35,400 --> 01:18:37,400
Uh-huh

1493
01:18:43,960 --> 01:18:45,960
Uh-huh

1494
01:18:58,200 --> 01:19:00,200
Well, that doesn't go anywhere else either

1495
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:05,640
Oh, we're opposite Greek and we don't have a paddle. It's the tea infuser

1496
01:19:05,640 --> 01:19:07,640
Oh

1497
01:19:09,480 --> 01:19:13,400
That was very specific. Um, I mean

1498
01:19:14,520 --> 01:19:18,280
It's all right. I'll get I get it. I get it. I could have got the hint because the things

1499
01:19:27,880 --> 01:19:30,680
I'm to go off of pure babes alone

1500
01:19:33,080 --> 01:19:35,080
Oh

1501
01:19:35,640 --> 01:19:40,120
I mean if the game helps me and points them the right way then sure, but uh

1502
01:19:42,200 --> 01:19:44,200
No

1503
01:19:47,720 --> 01:19:49,720
No

1504
01:19:50,840 --> 01:19:52,840
No

1505
01:19:54,280 --> 01:19:56,280
What

1506
01:19:59,720 --> 01:20:01,720
Okay

1507
01:20:03,320 --> 01:20:05,320
Yes

1508
01:20:06,600 --> 01:20:08,600
No, yes

1509
01:20:10,840 --> 01:20:12,840
I want to put it up

1510
01:20:13,800 --> 01:20:15,800
I don't know what's gotten into me today

1511
01:20:17,720 --> 01:20:19,720
It's clearly not

1512
01:20:23,560 --> 01:20:26,600
Stop stop talking do you understand? Okay

1513
01:20:28,280 --> 01:20:30,280
Oh, okay

1514
01:20:31,080 --> 01:20:33,080
Okay

1515
01:20:33,880 --> 01:20:35,880
Okay

1516
01:20:48,440 --> 01:20:50,440
I think we're doing it

1517
01:20:51,160 --> 01:20:53,160
Oh

1518
01:20:59,320 --> 01:21:02,520
Okay, what is this though packing peanuts

1519
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:09,400
Strawberries and a mid-today we first prepare for the most intense ink extraction

1520
01:21:09,480 --> 01:21:14,280
No, I'm too depressed to express for right now, but uh, oh this looks like a nightmare

1521
01:21:15,080 --> 01:21:18,440
After I have a few days to recover

1522
01:21:19,400 --> 01:21:24,040
Please don't be surprised if I start using my alternative to wear a heck of a lot more

1523
01:21:24,520 --> 01:21:26,760
Oh, wait, is this a hint that the candles go here?

1524
01:21:28,040 --> 01:21:30,040
No

1525
01:21:35,320 --> 01:21:37,320
I'm a bit nervous on this one after

1526
01:21:41,880 --> 01:21:43,880
Right remove everything

1527
01:21:45,320 --> 01:21:47,320
Let's just close the doors not our problem

1528
01:21:49,400 --> 01:21:52,040
It must I hope it was

1529
01:21:59,880 --> 01:22:02,120
Okay, we're a bit of a rough start bit of a rough

1530
01:22:04,440 --> 01:22:08,920
Okay, this can't go sideways so the only place it literally can fit

1531
01:22:12,280 --> 01:22:14,280
Had a lot

1532
01:22:15,320 --> 01:22:17,320
I'm not satisfied

1533
01:22:19,000 --> 01:22:21,000
Oh

1534
01:22:22,200 --> 01:22:24,200
This is a tricky one

1535
01:22:25,960 --> 01:22:28,280
Oh, it's obvious

1536
01:22:32,840 --> 01:22:34,840
Dave

1537
01:22:36,040 --> 01:22:38,040
Oh, I need like

1538
01:22:41,000 --> 01:22:43,000
Oh, this one's a scary one

1539
01:22:49,240 --> 01:22:54,520
Hey, okay, that I'm satisfied with I'm satisfied with that. Okay. Let's get that right. I've got a knife

1540
01:22:57,320 --> 01:22:59,080
Got a knife

1541
01:22:59,080 --> 01:23:00,360
Maybe

1542
01:23:00,360 --> 01:23:04,600
It doesn't seem to go up and down so it has to be so good. So I'm gonna I'm gonna go to PR

1543
01:23:05,880 --> 01:23:07,880
I'm very unconfident

1544
01:23:09,240 --> 01:23:12,520
Sizzlers. Yep. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Let me get up

1545
01:23:13,320 --> 01:23:14,840
Ah

1546
01:23:14,840 --> 01:23:18,920
Usb it can go either way. It was oh no, can I go up and down?

1547
01:23:19,640 --> 01:23:25,560
What was that? No, I saw that I saw that you were trying to turn at something. What were you turning at be honest? Oh

1548
01:23:27,640 --> 01:23:29,880
Okay usb you fit there

1549
01:23:31,080 --> 01:23:35,480
This is a very specific strony. What do you have there a knife? No

1550
01:23:43,480 --> 01:23:45,480
All right, I'm gonna be honest with you

1551
01:23:53,400 --> 01:23:57,000
But there's only one two three four crayons

1552
01:23:59,240 --> 01:24:01,240
Is it possible that

1553
01:24:02,280 --> 01:24:04,920
I mean he fits when I go there. Where were the candles go?

1554
01:24:05,720 --> 01:24:10,200
Well, something please think of the candles the candles don't have a home if you steal them

1555
01:24:11,000 --> 01:24:13,000
I might have to go up here

1556
01:24:14,680 --> 01:24:17,240
Although they don't look very organized up here

1557
01:24:18,920 --> 01:24:22,120
And there's literally nowhere else for them to go so like

1558
01:24:35,880 --> 01:24:37,880
I don't have much faith in this one to be honest

1559
01:24:38,840 --> 01:24:40,840
Why are you going sideways?

1560
01:24:42,840 --> 01:24:49,160
I'm gonna put that one there for now, but I feel like that's a red herring, but it's okay. What do you?

1561
01:24:50,920 --> 01:24:52,920
I don't even want to know what that's useful

1562
01:24:54,760 --> 01:24:57,400
From tall it you have some more candles or more

1563
01:24:59,960 --> 01:25:01,960
But I don't what's

1564
01:25:03,400 --> 01:25:05,400
Maybe it is the section I mean

1565
01:25:08,120 --> 01:25:10,120
Maybe

1566
01:25:14,200 --> 01:25:16,200
They all look like the same height

1567
01:25:18,280 --> 01:25:20,280
Candles go top left

1568
01:25:22,920 --> 01:25:24,920
Oh my god, you're so right

1569
01:25:27,320 --> 01:25:29,320
You're actually so right

1570
01:25:33,320 --> 01:25:35,320
Four paper clubs

1574
01:26:09,880 --> 01:26:11,880
I've got three tax

1575
01:26:14,760 --> 01:26:18,520

01:26:22,760 --> 01:26:24,760

I did it

1583
01:26:48,600 --> 01:26:53,240
Oh my god, I had no faith in that one. Thank you for the candle hen. I wouldn't have got that

1584
01:26:53,560 --> 01:26:55,560
I'm not even gonna pretend. I wouldn't have got that

1585
01:26:56,360 --> 01:26:58,360
one singular

1586
01:26:58,360 --> 01:27:01,080
Now try to imagine what purpose this kit has truly

01:27:02,680 --> 01:27:04,680
We need to drip the pink floors

01:28:39,960 --> 01:28:41,960
That looks like the Elden Ring

Game or brain rot setting and I'm so sorry. We can't leave our cage mercy one less. Oh, no, no, not that kind of cage

Okay

Right, this is clearly too big for that section so we can only go in this section

1621
01:30:21,080 --> 01:30:23,880
I'm gonna remove these because I'm not sure how much I believe them

01:34:47,400 --> 01:34:49,400

That your life doesn't actually have to amount to anything and the pressures you put on yourself are due to the

1716
01:39:42,760 --> 01:39:47,480
Finish it due to the what society we live in what the

1717
01:39:49,720 --> 01:39:51,720

01:40:16,600 --> 01:40:20,440
Due to the high table the capitalistic society

1723
01:40:20,440 --> 01:40:23,960
Yes, you do not actually have to be productive you have been taught this because

1724
01:40:24,760 --> 01:40:27,720
You are to be a made a product of the machine to explore

1725
01:40:30,200 --> 01:40:32,200
What's that a beacher

1726
01:40:32,840 --> 01:40:36,760
A beacher for his radicalizing news more news. It's like

01:40:48,680 --> 01:40:55,880
Feed the machine don't bite the heck I never said to hold 30% back for the tax man for nothing

1733
01:41:18,920 --> 01:41:21,480
Rob, how are you supposed to guess?

1734
01:41:23,560 --> 01:41:25,560
You just have to see what fits

1735
01:41:28,200 --> 01:41:34,520
I'm made to be a product of mommy's honey tea. Okay, that's the only kind of productive a low

1736
01:41:36,280 --> 01:41:38,280
Oh

1737
01:41:38,280 --> 01:41:40,760

1738
01:41:43,800 --> 01:41:45,800
No, I can't be right

1739
01:41:46,600 --> 01:41:47,320
A

1740
01:41:47,320 --> 01:41:49,320
tackle

1741
01:41:49,720 --> 01:41:52,760
They um have absolutely zero faith

1742
01:41:53,560 --> 01:41:58,120
Where am I even supposed to fit this wait, what do you get called? Oh that wait

1743
01:42:06,280 --> 01:42:08,280
Up here

1744
01:42:12,680 --> 01:42:15,880
Okay, that looks correct. I'll take that so that can't be correct

1745
01:42:17,960 --> 01:42:20,200
Oh, no, it can't be correct

1746
01:42:26,760 --> 01:42:29,080
Oh, this is not going to be an easy one I'm just

1747
01:42:30,040 --> 01:42:37,080
Right now that can't be right. Maybe a baby one. Okay. Okay

01:42:39,240 --> 01:42:42,600
Okay, okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. All right. All right. All right. All right

1749
01:42:51,480 --> 01:42:55,320
When I realize how everything is set up all I'm saying was going to be a minimum

1750
01:42:56,280 --> 01:43:01,560
Do you get paid minimum wage make sure you put minimum effort in

1751
01:43:17,080 --> 01:43:22,120
Okay, I'm gonna be honest. I think I need to look up a cheesy noodle for this one. This is insane

1752
01:43:23,000 --> 01:43:30,440
This is just a circle. So there it is for the circle. It's just a bit tape. I'm not supposed to do with that

1753
01:43:33,160 --> 01:43:39,480
I think the axe goes where the thought is I'm listening. I'm listening the axe

1754
01:43:42,440 --> 01:43:44,440
Is that what you meant? No

1755
01:43:44,520 --> 01:43:46,520
No, it can't be

1756
01:43:55,960 --> 01:44:01,960
You should give the energy you get never mind. Yeah, of course Johnny would be telling us the threat

My work put pushed me around a lot these promotions that uh

1779
01:46:19,480 --> 01:46:22,760
It was worth in the end because now my job is watching tv and drinking coffee

Oh real true. Love it. I love when this when you work the system. Give me stories where you work the system, please

1782
01:46:36,600 --> 01:46:37,480

Because when I left they gave me like an extra 700 quid and I was like I had to phone off and I was like

Something's not right here. Smile and they were like, uh, yes. Just take it and I'm like, okay

1790
01:47:16,680 --> 01:47:18,680

No, they get depressed when the catcher's open

1936
02:03:51,640 --> 02:03:53,640
It's a big dramatic for a game like this

1937
02:03:54,920 --> 02:03:58,040
Chapter four in our nature. We may actually do it

1938
02:03:59,720 --> 02:04:01,960
We may actually do it real

1939
02:04:03,240 --> 02:04:05,800
We may be two hours in but we may actually do it

1940
02:04:06,600 --> 02:04:08,600

Wow, that was a cute one. I like this puzzle and like this chapter

1965
02:07:02,840 --> 02:07:04,840

02:07:38,600 --> 02:07:39,560
One

1973
02:07:39,560 --> 02:07:41,480
No, what?

1974
02:07:41,480 --> 02:07:43,480
Right. It can't be that

1975
02:07:43,720 --> 02:07:47,000
Rotate the fuck out of this plank. That's not the mission objective

1976
02:07:51,800 --> 02:07:53,800
Go for symmetry

1977
02:08:01,880 --> 02:08:03,880
So

1978
02:08:23,800 --> 02:08:25,800
Symmetry

1979
02:08:26,680 --> 02:08:28,680
I

1980
02:08:31,720 --> 02:08:33,720
Would not have gotten that ever

1981
02:08:36,360 --> 02:08:41,880
I would not have gone that ever if he didn't say that I would not have figured that out that was far too difficult

1982
02:08:43,320 --> 02:08:46,600
Oh, it's um, okay deep red

1983
02:08:49,960 --> 02:08:54,120
Changing hues thank goodness. I'm not colorblind, huh?

1984
02:08:56,200 --> 02:09:10,600
Yeah, okay. Okay. I saw it. I saw it. I've done something's off for the queue. Perfect. It's the

1985
02:09:14,040 --> 02:09:18,600
This is very bright on me eyeballs. Oh, they're kissing

1986
02:09:26,440 --> 02:09:28,440
Yes, I'm off the screen. Uh

02:09:35,960 --> 02:09:40,360
Which one has the cat on it pick a jar any jar any jar at all

1988
02:09:40,440 --> 02:09:44,920
It's yours. I promise there's money and I'm not scamming pick a jar any jar refling any

1989
02:09:47,560 --> 02:09:49,560

02:09:50,120 --> 02:09:54,680
Oh, I see it. I see it. I saw it see it see it sword

1991
02:09:55,800 --> 02:09:57,880
Yeah, I see with the leaves even here

1992
02:10:00,280 --> 02:10:02,280
The right jar

1993
02:10:03,480 --> 02:10:08,200
You see emmy's ginger when she's clearly blonde and what universe is she blonde?

1994
02:10:08,360 --> 02:10:15,400
I don't know if this is like a culture thing or something and what universe is any blonde genuinely

1995
02:10:17,240 --> 02:10:19,240
She's clearly a yin-yang

1996
02:10:19,400 --> 02:10:23,240
So I'm not really sure why it's even up for debacle

1997
02:10:23,720 --> 02:10:26,920
I was very surprised when she was like, I'm I'm ginger

1998
02:10:27,720 --> 02:10:31,400
Yes, emmy you literally have orange hair your ginger

1999
02:10:34,200 --> 02:10:38,280
She's definitely blonde. Oh wait, are you being serious or am I getting trolled?

2000
02:10:40,200 --> 02:10:45,240
Am I being trolled? I'm unironically doing a poll right now. I think this must be a culture clash

2001
02:10:45,960 --> 02:10:46,840
because

2002
02:10:46,840 --> 02:10:47,880
uh

2003
02:10:47,880 --> 02:10:49,480
What?

2004
02:10:49,480 --> 02:10:51,480
Oh, that's me. Hi. Um

2005
02:10:52,440 --> 02:10:54,440
Hold on start a poll

2006
02:10:55,720 --> 02:11:00,760
Oh, I just closed the tab. Well, nice try. Let's try that again. We should try another poll. Gee

2007
02:11:01,560 --> 02:11:03,560
Okay, add poll

2008
02:11:04,840 --> 02:11:06,840
What hair

2009
02:11:07,800 --> 02:11:12,440
Hair color do you think emmers is question mark?

2010
02:11:13,400 --> 02:11:14,760
She's

2011
02:11:14,760 --> 02:11:16,760
She's ginger

2012
02:11:17,960 --> 02:11:20,600
Orange and brackets for those of you who are dumb

2013
02:11:21,880 --> 02:11:24,520
Because you're a dumb dumb if you think she's literally blonde

2014
02:11:25,480 --> 02:11:27,480
she's

2015
02:11:27,800 --> 02:11:30,440
Blonde and brackets yellow

2016
02:11:31,960 --> 02:11:33,960
And what?

2017
02:11:46,040 --> 02:11:48,040
Right there we go start full

2018
02:11:48,520 --> 02:11:50,920
Okay, I'm literally doing a poll and chat right now

2019
02:11:51,880 --> 02:11:59,000
What hair color do you think emmy is she's ginger and brackets orange? She's blonde and brackets

2020
02:11:59,480 --> 02:12:05,160
Yellow in what world is she actually blonde? Please be so for real right now. Are you mental?

2021
02:12:07,160 --> 02:12:13,720
I think she's a ginger blonde. No, you cannot be ginger blonde. You're either a ginger or you're a blonde

2022
02:12:14,360 --> 02:12:21,800
She's blonde at the top and it transitions to gingerish near the bottom. I've shown you her concepts are she's a yin or

2023
02:12:23,240 --> 02:12:28,040
Literally pumpkin hair. She's pumpkin themed voodoo doll themed

2024
02:12:28,840 --> 02:12:30,840
She's a yin or

2025
02:12:32,360 --> 02:12:38,920
I hope the last option is now do a poll for as there is hair color. Oh, you guys are gonna be split on that one

2026
02:12:39,480 --> 02:12:48,520
See you elite. I don't 35% of you think she's blonde. I used to be honest. Are you strong? Do you actually think she's blonde?

2027
02:12:49,240 --> 02:12:57,080
Thank you for the tip tiny spainy. How is she blonde? She's orange. She's a pumpkin. Her hair is themed after pumpkins

2028
02:12:58,120 --> 02:12:59,320
orange

2029
02:12:59,320 --> 02:13:00,760
Oh

2030
02:13:00,760 --> 02:13:07,080
Right now to do the real one. Okay. The veal or hair colors are the real a little bit bro, right? Let's do a zero

2031
02:13:07,480 --> 02:13:09,080
Azura's

2032
02:13:09,080 --> 02:13:11,080
hair color is

2033
02:13:13,640 --> 02:13:15,800
Green

2034
02:13:15,800 --> 02:13:17,800
blue

2035
02:13:29,640 --> 02:13:31,640
Okay, there we go

2036
02:13:33,000 --> 02:13:35,720
All right, those never pull up for Azura's hair color

2037
02:13:37,160 --> 02:13:39,160
I

2038
02:13:43,240 --> 02:13:45,400
Your choice is is it green?

2039
02:13:47,560 --> 02:13:49,560
Are you

2040
02:13:50,680 --> 02:13:54,120
I'm not even teal. Are you squidding me right now?

2041
02:13:57,160 --> 02:13:59,800
I don't have a said blonde liar

2042
02:14:00,600 --> 02:14:02,200
absolutely

2043
02:14:02,280 --> 02:14:07,080
Azura is literally a blue green mix. It's called teal. That's what I said. She's teal

2044
02:14:08,520 --> 02:14:15,080
It's awkward marine, which is a shade of green. No, don't say such things. It's seafoam green, which is green

2045
02:14:15,480 --> 02:14:17,880
No, don't say such things

2046
02:14:18,520 --> 02:14:23,320
Do you have long and right? I'll tell you what we're gonna look at. Azura's a seafoam

2047
02:14:23,640 --> 02:14:28,920
Mostly blue with hints of green teal would be mostly green with hints of blue

2048
02:14:29,800 --> 02:14:31,800
Oh

2049
02:14:32,520 --> 02:14:34,520
Are you squidding me right now?

2050
02:14:38,200 --> 02:14:40,600
We're being debated unironically

2051
02:14:41,800 --> 02:14:45,400
Pull up the color chart. You know what maybe her

2052
02:14:47,960 --> 02:14:53,720
Her concept art was a bit more accurate. Thank you tiny spanish. Thank you. Okay. Don't are you squidding me right?

2053
02:14:53,720 --> 02:15:01,560
Maybe it's a strawberry blonde. What universe? Hold on. I'm actually right strawberry blonde

2054
02:15:02,200 --> 02:15:04,200
Let's look it up and ask

2055
02:15:05,560 --> 02:15:07,560
That's orange

2056
02:15:09,880 --> 02:15:14,200
That's all I will literally show you the first picture that shows up

2057
02:15:16,760 --> 02:15:19,100
I'm getting heated. I'm actually getting heated

2058
02:15:21,240 --> 02:15:22,600
That's

2059
02:15:22,600 --> 02:15:24,600
orange

2060
02:15:24,600 --> 02:15:26,600
And what universe?

2061
02:15:29,560 --> 02:15:31,560
Where the fuck is the picture show me

2062
02:15:38,680 --> 02:15:40,680
Okay

2063
02:15:41,000 --> 02:15:43,400
Okay, this is what comes up

2064
02:15:44,360 --> 02:15:48,360
This claw is what comes up when you take strawberry blonde

2065
02:15:49,160 --> 02:15:56,200
It's orange. I'm sorry. It's orange. It's ginger

2066
02:15:57,640 --> 02:15:59,080
Oh my god

2067
02:15:59,080 --> 02:16:05,480
I'm getting trolled so hard. This is ginger. I type in strawberry blonde. Please your blood pressure. That's ginger. Thank you

2068
02:16:07,240 --> 02:16:12,200
And now you're saying Azura's got green hair. I'm getting trolled so hard. Oh my god the first oh

2069
02:16:13,400 --> 02:16:16,120
It's ginger. She's she's a yinya

2070
02:16:18,600 --> 02:16:21,480
Okay, right. Let's unbreak

2071
02:16:28,360 --> 02:16:31,560
The book is a logic puzzle on this yin. Like that?

2072
02:16:40,360 --> 02:16:42,360
What do you mean she's no ginger? I need her

2073
02:16:43,080 --> 02:16:47,080
I birthed her from my lungs. I'm convinced Johnny. She emmys 100 ginger

2074
02:16:48,040 --> 02:16:50,040
She's 100 ginger from the start

2075
02:16:50,760 --> 02:16:54,840
Her concept art. She's a pumpkin. She's based after a pumpkin and a

2076
02:16:56,040 --> 02:16:57,960
voodoo stuff

2077
02:16:57,960 --> 02:17:00,920
I were tame as she's still going down straight. I'm still going

2078
02:17:01,560 --> 02:17:03,560
I'm mlg at this game

2079
02:17:07,400 --> 02:17:13,640
Are you squidding me right now? Ah anonymous you need to visit a doctor. We are very worried for your eyes

2080
02:17:13,800 --> 02:17:21,480
Are you I'm not colorblind. I will rob. I don't know. Um, it must be a culture clash thing. That's just straight up ginger

2081
02:17:23,080 --> 02:17:29,320
Like what do you think a ginger person looks like then and then don't say eric from freaking south part

2082
02:17:33,080 --> 02:17:38,280
What is this I have no idea what i'm doing right now. I'm so sorry

2083
02:17:39,160 --> 02:17:41,160
I

2084
02:17:42,920 --> 02:17:45,640
Don't even have a hint of like where I can put anything

2085
02:17:53,800 --> 02:17:55,800
Speaking of so far crap

2086
02:18:08,280 --> 02:18:10,280
I

2087
02:18:12,120 --> 02:18:14,120
Just make them pairs. I mean I can do that easily

2088
02:18:20,440 --> 02:18:23,880
We'll crab legs are together little horns are together

2089
02:18:25,800 --> 02:18:27,800
With an iron horn

2090
02:18:30,920 --> 02:18:33,800
What? Oh, what was that?

2091
02:18:34,760 --> 02:18:37,960
Are you giving me a hint to where the location

2092
02:18:41,480 --> 02:18:45,320
You see she'll mirror it. Yeah

2093
02:18:54,600 --> 02:18:56,600
Are you squiddling me right now?

2094
02:18:57,560 --> 02:19:03,400
Don't worry trust chak chak knows best and will always help and never lie to you believe us

2095
02:19:04,360 --> 02:19:05,640

Thank you anonymous

2097
02:19:08,120 --> 02:19:11,080
I do trust and believe in you but something

2098
02:19:11,800 --> 02:19:13,800
I find it hard to believe that I

2099
02:19:19,160 --> 02:19:21,160
Oh

2100
02:19:22,200 --> 02:19:24,200

2101
02:19:25,160 --> 02:19:28,200
Though those two kiss why aren't you

2102
02:19:30,760 --> 02:19:32,760
Kiss right now

2103
02:19:38,760 --> 02:19:43,000
Kissing they are kissing those kiss really low

2104
02:19:47,000 --> 02:19:49,000
Nothing can touch

2105
02:19:54,760 --> 02:19:56,760
I

2106
02:19:58,280 --> 02:20:00,280
Put them over here

2107
02:20:01,240 --> 02:20:03,240
Oh

02:20:19,160 --> 02:20:22,680
Is it gonna float in that's loaded in

2109
02:20:23,640 --> 02:20:25,640
I

2110
02:20:28,600 --> 02:20:30,600
Want to try and find a slaw

2111
02:20:33,560 --> 02:20:35,560
I'm trying to find it

2112
02:20:44,200 --> 02:20:46,200
Verical mirror image

2113
02:20:47,080 --> 02:20:53,320
You're probably making symmetry. Yeah, but like nothing's like being like I yes, I register in the spot

2114
02:20:55,080 --> 02:20:57,080
Try to find this

2115
02:20:57,480 --> 02:21:01,160
Have you ever done an IQ that yeah, it's gonna be a don't it's our reward though

2116
02:21:01,720 --> 02:21:04,680
It's gonna be a very low result. That's all I can tell you

2117
02:21:05,720 --> 02:21:06,840
Oh

2118
02:21:06,840 --> 02:21:08,840
No, this oh

2119
02:21:09,800 --> 02:21:15,720
It's like half getting dragged half not right close your eyes. I'm sorry. I need to like I don't actually know where it wants

2120
02:21:15,720 --> 02:21:17,800
Fucking throw on the

2121
02:21:45,720 --> 02:21:47,720
Oh

2122
02:22:07,240 --> 02:22:09,880
No pumpkin space not no

2123
02:22:16,520 --> 02:22:20,040
No, no

2124
02:22:25,240 --> 02:22:27,240
Mommy's cooking right now this

2125
02:22:39,960 --> 02:22:41,960
Is that

2126
02:22:42,840 --> 02:22:44,840
Benny

2127
02:22:46,200 --> 02:22:48,200
Benny no

2128
02:22:50,520 --> 02:22:55,880
What what everything is doing a little down to down

2129
02:22:58,440 --> 02:23:00,440
No

2130
02:23:11,960 --> 02:23:13,960
Oh

2131
02:23:23,720 --> 02:23:25,720
The cat literally try to give me a hint

2132
02:23:41,960 --> 02:23:43,960
Oh

2133
02:24:09,800 --> 02:24:11,800
Hydration check replaying

2134
02:24:12,920 --> 02:24:14,920
How long will your donut on me?

2135
02:24:15,000 --> 02:24:19,160
Um, I'm doing a 48 hour one

2136
02:24:19,560 --> 02:24:27,240
Azura has to do a 12 hour one. Um just for living situation, but I think she'll be able to do that after it, which I'm very excited

2137
02:24:30,680 --> 02:24:32,440
Right, okay. Um

2138
02:24:32,440 --> 02:24:36,280
Actually, I need to write Azura's donut phone stuff out because she did it with a bleeding heart

2139
02:24:36,280 --> 02:24:38,760
So I need to come in and be like, okay now do this

2140
02:24:42,760 --> 02:24:44,760
48 hours, yes, uh

2141
02:24:46,680 --> 02:24:50,360
I think mercy will be moved out by the time her donut phone comes around

2142
02:24:51,160 --> 02:24:54,120
So she can do 48 hours as just as there is cases about you

2143
02:24:58,840 --> 02:25:00,840
No, I wanted to make a bulb

2144
02:25:05,800 --> 02:25:07,800
Is this symmetry again

2145
02:25:07,800 --> 02:25:09,800
I

2146
02:25:11,400 --> 02:25:15,080
Is oh my god, hold on. I need to like open my eyes really wait to do this

2147
02:25:19,080 --> 02:25:25,480
Hold on hold on. Sorry. I probably look really weird right now. I need I can't compare if my eyes aren't like wide open

2148
02:25:31,400 --> 02:25:33,400
Hold on

2149
02:25:38,200 --> 02:25:40,200
You

2150
02:25:54,440 --> 02:25:58,280
Uh-huh. Oh you

2151
02:25:58,600 --> 02:26:00,600

2152
02:26:06,040 --> 02:26:08,040
Are you squidding me right now?

2153
02:26:10,040 --> 02:26:17,560
Oh, jackson's job. Hey stony. Thanks for feeling her. Oh, my nice of you. You're welcome. I'm glad you can enjoy the girls

2154
02:26:19,320 --> 02:26:21,320
It's only broken on stream. She's still reading

2155
02:26:23,320 --> 02:26:25,800
I'm like the chat disconnect. I hope no

2156
02:26:26,520 --> 02:26:30,200
Okay, right hold on. I need to do it again

2157
02:26:47,400 --> 02:26:51,560
I can't I don't want to say I can't see it yet, but I can't see it yet

2158
02:26:56,760 --> 02:26:58,920
Is it obvious and maybe

2159
02:27:01,960 --> 02:27:04,840
Oh you you're different

2160
02:27:07,560 --> 02:27:12,760
Okay, we did it. We did it. We did it. We did it. I got it. I got it. I did it

2161
02:27:13,800 --> 02:27:16,280
That was a little harder than I thought. I had to like

2162
02:27:17,960 --> 02:27:23,240
I don't know if you can see how well my eyes track. Uh, but that was like I had to go for it

2163
02:27:24,200 --> 02:27:26,200
Okay rocks

2164
02:27:27,000 --> 02:27:29,000
Man women love rocks

2165
02:27:33,720 --> 02:27:35,720
Gugli eyes

2166
02:27:37,320 --> 02:27:40,440
Gugli gugli eyes sweeties

2167
02:27:44,760 --> 02:27:46,760
Oh

2168
02:27:47,560 --> 02:27:49,560
Oh, I like this one

2169
02:27:50,520 --> 02:27:59,560
I like it very much. It's that's a good one. Very nice. Good one. Good one. I like that one

2170
02:28:07,560 --> 02:28:09,560
Oh, these are lotus seeds

2171
02:28:10,440 --> 02:28:16,360
Oh, they're all seeds. Oh, I love this one. Oh, those are the windfall seeds

2172
02:28:17,080 --> 02:28:19,080
What are you

2173
02:28:30,680 --> 02:28:32,680
I make them kiss

2174
02:28:33,480 --> 02:28:36,120
Oh, no, is it symmetry again? Be honest. I think it may be

2175
02:28:40,120 --> 02:28:42,120
Oh, it's symmetry again. All right

2176
02:28:42,680 --> 02:28:47,000
All right. All right. All right. I know she's about to ask this is her seed spread

2177
02:28:47,640 --> 02:28:52,120
Mommy puzzle moment puzzle. She disconnected from it. Is chat disconnected?

2178
02:28:52,840 --> 02:28:56,760
Will you and the girls ever use scripts posted to read it? No, we need the legal copyright

2179
02:28:57,160 --> 02:29:02,120
Of it. So we can't use that kind of stuff unless like someone came to us and we're like, hey

2180
02:29:03,400 --> 02:29:05,720
I give you all rights to this

2181
02:29:05,720 --> 02:29:07,720
Oh

2182
02:29:10,680 --> 02:29:13,000
But no, we cannot do that for copyright reasons

2183
02:29:17,480 --> 02:29:26,280
Wow, I love this one. It's so pretty just like you're reefing pretty little puzzles

2184
02:29:30,280 --> 02:29:34,040
What are you? I don't even know what seed you are. That's fantastic

2185
02:29:35,720 --> 02:29:37,720
I

2186
02:29:52,280 --> 02:29:55,960
Poppy this is a poppy seed. This is where you get opium from

2187
02:29:58,280 --> 02:30:00,280
Yes, I'm telling the truth

2188
02:30:00,360 --> 02:30:01,800
if you didn't know

2189
02:30:01,880 --> 02:30:06,840
Okay, and where when our derivatives of a plant

2190
02:30:08,280 --> 02:30:14,920
Um for the poppies you have to slash them before they bloom and then they'll secrete the opium

2191
02:30:16,600 --> 02:30:19,800
It's rather fascinating. Honestly, that's why like

2192
02:30:20,760 --> 02:30:28,120
Meth is because it's like lab made it's so dangerous and much more addicting because like literally it was produced to be that way

2193
02:30:28,600 --> 02:30:32,120
So very scary stuff. That's why you should never smoke crack

2194
02:30:33,080 --> 02:30:36,200
Because it's man made and the effects are insane

2195
02:30:36,840 --> 02:30:41,960
Whereas at least if you did her um cooking or heroin, you know, it's from a plant. So

2196
02:30:42,920 --> 02:30:44,760
It's a little bit better

2197
02:30:44,760 --> 02:30:49,560
Because it's not as bad, but it's not necessarily that good as well. So don't get

2198
02:30:49,800 --> 02:30:51,800
Is

2199
02:30:54,600 --> 02:30:58,360
Well, these three are the same color and have stripes these

2200
02:31:00,040 --> 02:31:02,040
Oh, but that one's the same

2201
02:31:03,800 --> 02:31:07,160
You're the only thing we need. Ah, are you so sweet people?

2202
02:31:12,600 --> 02:31:16,440
Well, you ever have male members in veal or sadly not no, um

2203
02:31:17,080 --> 02:31:19,080
The reason veal work is

2204
02:31:19,080 --> 02:31:24,200
You know can work is because the team is female content careers behind the scene

2205
02:31:25,000 --> 02:31:26,280
um

2206
02:31:26,280 --> 02:31:29,400
And unfortunately like I can't advise on male creation because I

2207
02:31:31,560 --> 02:31:33,560
What the heck am I supposed to do

2208
02:31:35,560 --> 02:31:37,560
This one's a curious pale

2209
02:31:39,800 --> 02:31:41,800
Hmm

2210
02:31:41,800 --> 02:31:46,120
Maybe if it's got like black

2211
02:31:49,000 --> 02:31:51,000
Like

2212
02:31:51,160 --> 02:31:53,720
That's got pink pink pink

2213
02:31:56,120 --> 02:31:58,120
Green

2214
02:32:03,160 --> 02:32:07,800
Why am I trying to achieve I'm not really sure I'm trying though

2215
02:32:12,200 --> 02:32:14,200
Oh, this one's tricky

2216
02:32:14,840 --> 02:32:18,520
Competing as a meal. Give me that strontium baby

2217
02:32:20,600 --> 02:32:22,600
Solids in the corner

2218
02:32:27,320 --> 02:32:29,320
Oh

2219
02:32:33,000 --> 02:32:39,160
That's so good. Good catch reflin. That's such a good one. Oh, I like that one

2220
02:32:40,120 --> 02:32:42,120
I would never have thought of that. That was a good one

2221
02:32:45,320 --> 02:32:47,640
Mild case of severe strontia addiction

2222
02:32:48,680 --> 02:32:50,680
Stainless reflin

2223
02:32:51,480 --> 02:32:54,520
Oh dear, right. We need a corner piece if there is any

2224
02:32:56,760 --> 02:32:58,760
Dear

2225
02:32:59,240 --> 02:33:04,040
I really feel like there's much corner pieces at all. Well, maybe you

2226
02:33:09,160 --> 02:33:11,160
Think

2227
02:33:36,840 --> 02:33:38,840
Hmm

2228
02:33:39,160 --> 02:33:54,480
Oh wow, I'm struggling with this one, wait let me kick a little bit though.

2229
02:33:54,480 --> 02:34:09,040
I don't have any corner pieces, how can I be, oh, is it color-

2230
02:34:09,120 --> 02:34:12,720
I can't be color-coordinator, so I'm gonna puzzle together.

2231
02:34:12,720 --> 02:34:17,760
How can a puzzle be a puzzle if it isn't puzzle-together?

2232
02:34:17,760 --> 02:34:20,080
It's a myth.

2233
02:34:20,080 --> 02:34:23,920
No.

2234
02:34:23,920 --> 02:34:33,440
Let me try to quickly find the solution, I'm sorry!

2235
02:34:33,520 --> 02:34:39,120
That was like a corner piece.

2236
02:34:39,120 --> 02:34:44,320
Maybe?

2237
02:34:44,320 --> 02:34:50,080
Pink when you have in top right should be bottom right.

2238
02:34:50,080 --> 02:34:53,040
I knew that.

2239
02:34:53,040 --> 02:34:56,720
You're on about honestly, I'm so obviously-

2240
02:34:56,720 --> 02:35:01,040
I don't know, do you get embarrassed being wrong all the time, refund?

2241
02:35:01,120 --> 02:35:04,400
Let's try to do that.

2242
02:35:06,960 --> 02:35:09,920
Oh that looks right.

2243
02:35:12,480 --> 02:35:17,920
Oh yeah, ooh up a bit.

2244
02:35:20,320 --> 02:35:23,840
Well that looks correct.

2245
02:35:23,840 --> 02:35:26,880
Look they're kissing!

2246
02:35:27,120 --> 02:35:35,280
Hmm, doesn't seem too right on this bit, I'm not convinced.

2247
02:35:35,280 --> 02:35:37,440
Need to kiss another day because I don't think-

2248
02:35:37,440 --> 02:35:41,440
Okay that looks more like a okay, how?

2249
02:35:42,000 --> 02:35:47,440
Okay you, you kiss right now.

2250
02:35:47,440 --> 02:35:58,000
Okay, okay.

2251
02:35:58,000 --> 02:36:08,000
Uh-huh, uh-huh.

2252
02:36:08,000 --> 02:36:15,120
This is not look right to me at all, what the fuck, I see so hard.

2253
02:36:15,200 --> 02:36:21,040
Kicking? I don't know, am I kicking? I don't know what is the little green one

2254
02:36:21,040 --> 02:36:23,680
in between.

2255
02:36:29,680 --> 02:36:34,000
Very true, very true.

2256
02:36:34,000 --> 02:36:37,680
But I cannot do shapes at all.

2257
02:36:38,560 --> 02:36:47,760
Well no, these- right, so don't get rid of it just yet, but-

2258
02:36:49,360 --> 02:36:52,320
Bro, I can't do isometric shapes!

2259
02:36:52,320 --> 02:36:57,280
Oh, what? Nothing fits!

2260
02:36:58,480 --> 02:37:01,760
I don't look right.

2261
02:37:02,240 --> 02:37:05,760
Like that, no.

2262
02:37:05,760 --> 02:37:08,880
Right, okay, hold on.

2263
02:37:09,600 --> 02:37:13,840
It's just- okay, okay, okay.

2264
02:37:14,560 --> 02:37:22,320
Okay, okay, okay.

2265
02:37:22,320 --> 02:37:29,840
I'm here for uh-huh, maybe, possibly, possibly.

2266
02:37:32,320 --> 02:37:38,240
Uh-huh, uh-huh. Okay, okay, don't, don't, don't let up now.

2267
02:37:38,240 --> 02:37:45,040
Don't let up now, oh, oh, oh!

2268
02:37:45,040 --> 02:37:51,760
We did it! That was so good! It all came together!

2269
02:37:51,760 --> 02:37:55,920
Yeah, you can do it, replaying, see? That's proof why you gotta keep

2270
02:37:55,920 --> 02:37:59,200
persevering. It doesn't matter if you keep jamming it in over and over, you'll

2271
02:37:59,200 --> 02:38:01,760
eventually get the result you want.

2272
02:38:01,760 --> 02:38:06,320
Stronikals 2024, thank you.

2273
02:38:06,320 --> 02:38:10,720
Okay, let's see what we're dealing with here.

2274
02:38:12,000 --> 02:38:19,920
Hydration check! What do you mean by that? Hydration, hydration, hydration!

2275
02:38:21,440 --> 02:38:24,720
Are your, are your strontium copium levels going up?

2276
02:38:24,720 --> 02:38:30,240
Know that I can do longer streams again?

2277
02:38:30,240 --> 02:38:37,600
Oh, is this symmetry be honest?

2278
02:38:37,600 --> 02:38:43,920
Oh, actually, I just clicked off him. It is symmetry, right, okay.

2279
02:38:49,040 --> 02:38:52,720
Oh, are we free of restrictions? I thought we had a little more time.

2280
02:38:52,720 --> 02:38:57,280
Um, I'm still feeling depresi-wessy because my dad's gone.

2281
02:38:57,280 --> 02:39:03,600
Um, but I am going to focus on the work that I missed because there's a

2282
02:39:03,600 --> 02:39:07,360
lot of v-tubers that are waiting for me to edit the collabs that

2283
02:39:07,360 --> 02:39:12,480
they were very keen to agree to me with. So I've got a bit of a work ahead but

2284
02:39:12,480 --> 02:39:16,080
don't be surprised when there's a bit of an explosion of ASMR videos on my

2285
02:39:16,080 --> 02:39:19,120
YouTube channel or on Patreon as well.

2286
02:39:19,120 --> 02:39:29,520
Um.

2287
02:39:40,080 --> 02:39:45,520
It's symmetry. Kitty! No, you're doing it.

2288
02:39:46,080 --> 02:39:51,920
Symmetry's in a lot of pockets. Yeah, this seems to be the reason.

2289
02:39:54,320 --> 02:39:58,240
I hope you feel better soon. Yeah, it's trying to explode on Patreon, yeah.

2290
02:39:58,240 --> 02:40:05,920
No worries, take your time, yeah. Um, it's why I picked three shorter games, just...

2291
02:40:06,320 --> 02:40:10,320
Eh.

2292
02:40:14,560 --> 02:40:16,320
Oh wait.

2293
02:40:20,400 --> 02:40:22,320
Is that what I'm supposed to find?

2294
02:40:24,480 --> 02:40:28,320
I think so, I think I just suck on putting it in, please.

2295
02:40:30,640 --> 02:40:34,320
Oh, you zoom out.

2296
02:40:36,800 --> 02:40:40,160
Oh, there's snowflakes.

2297
02:40:40,880 --> 02:40:43,840
That's not right then.

2298
02:40:47,760 --> 02:40:51,760
Did you know something, something snowflakes aren't all equally created or

2299
02:40:51,760 --> 02:40:56,320
something? Ah, I found it.

2300
02:40:58,240 --> 02:41:01,120
Uh, well your gemmets put ASMR in their Patreon channels as well.

2301
02:41:01,120 --> 02:41:07,600
Yes, they already have audios of the variety up.

2302
02:41:07,600 --> 02:41:10,160
More?

2303
02:41:10,160 --> 02:41:14,800
Oh, more.

2304
02:41:21,280 --> 02:41:25,200
Okay, and then we just need the ends.

2305
02:41:25,760 --> 02:41:29,440
They're like little banisters. Okay, this one is a cute one, I like that one.

2306
02:41:29,440 --> 02:41:31,760
That one's a good one, good one.

2307
02:41:31,760 --> 02:41:37,040
Are you gonna make more hypno stuff? Uh, not on Patreon because it's a ban.

2308
02:41:37,040 --> 02:41:41,200
I'm not allowed to put it on Patreon, unfortunately.

2309
02:41:41,200 --> 02:41:49,920
Okay, the section, okay. And this one, that's such a good one.

2310
02:41:49,920 --> 02:41:53,520
I'm here for it, it's a sad one.

2311
02:41:54,480 --> 02:41:59,280
Mmm, but I'll put it up on Twitter, I have a four part series on Twitter.

2312
02:41:59,280 --> 02:42:05,600
Once I edit it, I need to edit it first. I've got a lot of editing I need to do

2313
02:42:05,600 --> 02:42:09,600
actually over the next few days, but I'll get there.

2314
02:42:09,600 --> 02:42:16,000
Um, you just need to let me... Oh, this is such a good one.

2315
02:42:16,000 --> 02:42:19,840
I approve very much of this one.

2316
02:42:19,840 --> 02:42:23,920
Oh, bing.

2317
02:42:23,920 --> 02:42:27,920
Bing, bing. Yeah, that's what I thought.

2318
02:42:27,920 --> 02:42:31,600
You better be bing bonging me.

2319
02:42:38,240 --> 02:42:44,160
Oh, no. Can we release the slides?

2320
02:42:45,120 --> 02:42:48,480
Oh, no.

2321
02:42:48,480 --> 02:42:54,960
Oh, what's that? One, two, three. One, two, three.

2322
02:42:54,960 --> 02:43:01,440
One, two, three, four. One, two, three, four.

2323
02:43:01,440 --> 02:43:10,480
Um, Outside one, uh, Opposite again.

2324
02:43:14,320 --> 02:43:19,520
Oh, there's our spoiler. We fed the spoilers.

2325
02:43:19,520 --> 02:43:23,040
So proud of you working hard for this one. Yeah, I'm glad.

2326
02:43:23,040 --> 02:43:28,640
You guys enjoy. Near Earth organizer, what a strange name for a

2327
02:43:28,640 --> 02:43:31,200
chapter.

2328
02:43:31,920 --> 02:43:35,840
What's this about Hypno? I like Hypno content, but it's banned

2329
02:43:35,840 --> 02:43:40,160
on Patreon, so I have to do it on Twitter.

2330
02:43:44,160 --> 02:44:00,160
Huh?

2331
02:44:00,160 --> 02:44:06,160
Huh?

2332
02:44:06,160 --> 02:44:10,160
What, is it not to go there?

2333
02:44:14,160 --> 02:44:28,160
What's that? Huh?

2334
02:44:28,160 --> 02:44:36,160
Oh my god, we have to tame it.

2335
02:44:36,160 --> 02:44:42,160
It becomes a donut. It goes in the hole. It comes on up.

2336
02:44:42,160 --> 02:44:52,160
Oh, I'm not going to like this one.

2337
02:44:52,160 --> 02:45:02,160
Okay, go here.

2338
02:45:02,160 --> 02:45:08,160
Oh, it's because we're in a coffee shop.

2339
02:45:08,160 --> 02:45:14,160
It's making coffee sound. Oh my god, that's such a strange one.

2340
02:45:14,160 --> 02:45:18,160
Okay, right. Then we're going to bring it back.

2341
02:45:18,160 --> 02:45:22,160
We're going to catch it. Then we've got the apple.

2342
02:45:22,160 --> 02:45:26,160
And we're going to put the apple in the golf.

2343
02:45:26,160 --> 02:45:30,160
Okay, and then we're going to put it in the cup of tea.

2344
02:45:30,160 --> 02:45:34,160
Right.

2345
02:45:34,160 --> 02:45:44,160
Bitch!

2346
02:45:44,160 --> 02:45:48,160
Right, apple into the golf.

2347
02:45:48,160 --> 02:45:52,160
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. You just, you just hold your horses, sir.

2348
02:45:52,160 --> 02:45:58,160
We're going to beat the golf into the constellation which drops into a tea or something. I don't know.

2349
02:45:58,160 --> 02:46:04,160
Oh, do I need to pot it? Maybe I need to pot it.

2350
02:46:04,160 --> 02:46:08,160
Okay, become a donut. Pull back.

2351
02:46:08,160 --> 02:46:14,160
And then loads of gravel here.

2352
02:46:14,160 --> 02:46:18,160
No. No, what?

2353
02:46:18,160 --> 02:46:22,160
Right.

2354
02:46:22,160 --> 02:46:28,160
Oh, no.

2355
02:46:28,160 --> 02:46:34,160
Okay, okay, okay, got worms. So what happens if I make it go right, sir? Does anything happen?

2356
02:46:34,160 --> 02:46:38,160
No, it's wrong. Okay, that's fine. Now I know it's wrong.

2357
02:46:38,160 --> 02:46:42,160
Oh, I've just put that in.

2358
02:46:42,160 --> 02:46:46,160
Right, become a donut. Unbecome a donut.

2359
02:46:46,160 --> 02:46:50,160
Okay, now we've got an apple. Now go to the golf man.

2360
02:46:50,160 --> 02:46:54,160
Beautiful, stunning, gorgeous. Now we are going to turn these right side

2361
02:46:54,160 --> 02:46:58,160
for some ungodly known reason.

2362
02:46:58,160 --> 02:47:02,160
I don't know why, but we are.

2363
02:47:02,160 --> 02:47:06,160
Right, well.

2364
02:47:06,160 --> 02:47:10,160
Oh, God, this is awful.

2365
02:47:10,160 --> 02:47:16,160
What? Am I not to put it in the hole? Be honest.

2366
02:47:16,160 --> 02:47:20,160
Oh, you need to overshoot the hole?

2367
02:47:20,160 --> 02:47:24,160
Who's supposed to figure that out in their day off?

2368
02:47:24,160 --> 02:47:28,160
Honestly. Right, go in the hole.

2369
02:47:28,160 --> 02:47:32,160
Go and become a golf ball. And then

2370
02:47:32,160 --> 02:47:36,160
and then just fucking send it.

2371
02:47:40,160 --> 02:47:44,160
I did that anyway. You're such a stinky game.

2372
02:47:44,160 --> 02:47:48,160
Patreon isn't stingy on it.

2373
02:47:48,160 --> 02:47:52,160
It's actually our Mastercard Overlord.

2374
02:47:52,160 --> 02:47:56,160
That is the reason why you can't do a lot of stuff.

2375
02:47:56,160 --> 02:48:00,160
So always thank you.

2376
02:48:00,160 --> 02:48:04,160
I'm sorry, was that yes to then posting?

2377
02:48:04,160 --> 02:48:08,160
I do it. I don't really ask the girls to do it just because it's a lot of

2378
02:48:08,160 --> 02:48:12,160
extra effort, but I could do it.

2379
02:48:12,160 --> 02:48:16,160
What?

2380
02:48:16,160 --> 02:48:20,160
What?

2381
02:48:20,160 --> 02:48:24,160
Uh, I...

2382
02:48:24,160 --> 02:48:28,160
If you late, save for work, I can maybe get

2383
02:48:28,160 --> 02:48:32,160
Amy to do that.

2384
02:48:32,160 --> 02:48:36,160
You spin me.

2385
02:48:36,160 --> 02:48:40,160
That wanted to stroke midnight or something?

2386
02:48:40,160 --> 02:48:44,160
Wait, really? What's wrong with the two?

2387
02:48:44,160 --> 02:48:48,160
Oh, they dictate the whole world.

2388
02:48:48,160 --> 02:48:52,160
Mastercard dictate everything.

2389
02:48:52,160 --> 02:48:56,160
They are literally our overlords. Like, I'm not even kidding.

2390
02:48:56,160 --> 02:49:00,160
That's not me, like, tinfoil hatin'. They literally call the shots on the internet.

2391
02:49:00,160 --> 02:49:04,160
That's why Patreon ban, like, step...

2392
02:49:04,160 --> 02:49:08,160
Mm-hmm.

2393
02:49:08,160 --> 02:49:12,160
And, like, hypnosis, because they said it's, like,

2394
02:49:12,160 --> 02:49:16,160
there's no consent with it when literally that's

2395
02:49:16,160 --> 02:49:20,160
actually the entire thing about hypnosis.

2396
02:49:20,160 --> 02:49:24,160
Yeah, so you have to...

2397
02:49:24,160 --> 02:49:28,160
What am I doing here? I don't know.

2398
02:49:32,160 --> 02:49:36,160
Is it in the shadow of that line or something?

2399
02:49:36,160 --> 02:49:40,160
Mm-hmm.

2400
02:49:40,160 --> 02:49:44,160
Oh, I was typing it over, so I can mention

2401
02:49:44,160 --> 02:49:48,160
the PMIC process. They control the money.

2402
02:49:48,160 --> 02:49:52,160
Yep, server controls the Mastercard, controls the universe.

2403
02:49:52,160 --> 02:49:56,160
What am I trying to achieve?

2404
02:49:56,160 --> 02:50:00,160
I don't know.

2405
02:50:00,160 --> 02:50:04,160
Um...

2406
02:50:04,160 --> 02:50:08,160
What is this?

2407
02:50:08,160 --> 02:50:12,160
Mommy, I have to ask, but why is the thumbnail...it's glitched. The thumbnail's correct for me on my

2408
02:50:12,160 --> 02:50:16,160
end. I'm not sure why.

2409
02:50:16,160 --> 02:50:20,160
Does it...replay? Hold...right, close your eyes.

2410
02:50:26,160 --> 02:50:30,160
A singular pale?

2411
02:50:30,160 --> 02:50:34,160
A singular pale was my frickin' hint.

2412
02:50:42,160 --> 02:50:46,160
Don't look.

2413
02:50:46,160 --> 02:50:50,160
It's not a wild dog.

2414
02:50:50,160 --> 02:50:54,160
Oh, well, excuse me.

2415
02:50:54,160 --> 02:50:58,160
Hmm.

2416
02:50:58,160 --> 02:51:02,160
I'll try the quick question. How likely will this be?

2417
02:51:02,160 --> 02:51:06,160
Oh, no.

2418
02:51:06,160 --> 02:51:10,160
Huh? Are the shadows wrong? Are these shadows telling

2419
02:51:10,160 --> 02:51:14,160
you what goes in front of them?

2420
02:51:28,160 --> 02:51:32,160
What?

2421
02:51:32,160 --> 02:51:36,160
What?

2422
02:51:36,160 --> 02:51:40,160
The horse just doesn't care.

2423
02:51:40,160 --> 02:51:44,160
He's just off on me.

2424
02:51:44,160 --> 02:51:48,160
Maybe who comes after?

2425
02:51:48,160 --> 02:51:52,160
Okay.

2426
02:51:52,160 --> 02:51:56,160
That doesn't make sense, though.

2427
02:51:56,160 --> 02:52:00,160
Symmetry with a horse in the middle?

2428
02:52:00,160 --> 02:52:04,160
No, those six people.

2429
02:52:04,160 --> 02:52:08,160
Maybe Merritt, hate on the shadows?

2430
02:52:08,160 --> 02:52:12,160
That's a good suggestion.

2431
02:52:12,160 --> 02:52:16,160
Unfortunately, that's not our solution.

2432
02:52:16,160 --> 02:52:20,160
What? Size order?

2433
02:52:20,160 --> 02:52:24,160
I don't know.

2434
02:52:24,160 --> 02:52:28,160
Staircase thing?

2435
02:52:28,160 --> 02:52:32,160
Oh, I just realized I'm covering up half of the puzzle.

2436
02:52:32,160 --> 02:52:36,160
Does that not bother anyone?

2437
02:52:36,160 --> 02:52:40,160
I'll just be a big-headed ass down here about that.

2438
02:52:40,160 --> 02:52:44,160
I don't know what you're talking about.

2439
02:52:44,160 --> 02:52:48,160
Keep playing.

2440
02:52:48,160 --> 02:52:52,160
You can move the shadows.

2441
02:52:52,160 --> 02:52:56,160
No way would they do a silly thing like that.

2442
02:53:04,160 --> 02:53:08,160
The game got real hard to look at every puzzle.

2443
02:53:08,160 --> 02:53:12,160
I think you're original in the right track.

2444
02:53:12,160 --> 02:53:16,160
Oh, it's a constellation.

2445
02:53:22,160 --> 02:53:26,160
What's that?

2446
02:53:26,160 --> 02:53:30,160
I'm too low IQ to discover such.

2447
02:53:30,160 --> 02:53:34,160
What's that? I'm too low IQ to discover such.

2448
02:53:34,160 --> 02:53:38,160
What's that?

2449
02:53:38,160 --> 02:53:42,160
What's that thing?

2450
02:53:42,160 --> 02:53:46,160
I don't know, but it's a map.

2451
02:53:46,160 --> 02:53:50,160
It's not even the map.

2452
02:53:50,160 --> 02:53:54,160
What's that?

2453
02:53:54,160 --> 02:53:58,160
I don't know.

2454
02:53:58,160 --> 02:54:02,160
I don't think so.

2455
02:54:02,160 --> 02:54:31,720
that was me me that's all I'm saying that was not me

2456
02:54:31,720 --> 02:54:45,120
was all the game because what I'm not I mean it's just discovering it itself

2457
02:54:45,120 --> 02:55:03,640
really who's that Pokemon I didn't see the chat I it's just kind of doing it on

2458
02:55:03,640 --> 02:55:09,240
its own I mean I'm not complaining I'll take an easy one kind of sliding in a

2459
02:55:09,240 --> 02:55:24,000
place of it honestly this game I didn't think I was gonna like it as much but

2460
02:55:24,000 --> 02:55:27,280
this is definitely like a solo experience you just want to chill out and

2461
02:55:27,280 --> 02:55:32,120
not really think too hard other than that kitchen one which was a complete

2462
02:55:32,120 --> 02:55:35,800
nonsense that was a bit like I'm not being funny but you're taking the piss

2463
02:55:36,520 --> 02:55:43,720
okay but everything else not really in it oh god I have to organize a desktop you

What?

2492
03:02:43,040 --> 03:02:45,040
Burning thing.

2493
03:02:48,040 --> 03:02:50,040
That's a friend turned spell at me.

2494
03:02:51,040 --> 03:02:53,040
I need to...

2495
03:02:59,040 --> 03:03:01,040
Aww.

2496
03:03:01,040 --> 03:03:03,040
I need to turn this around.

2497
03:03:09,040 --> 03:03:11,040
So peculiar, truly.

2498
03:03:15,040 --> 03:03:17,040
Yay.

2499
03:03:19,040 --> 03:03:21,040
They're getting bigger.

2500
03:03:21,040 --> 03:03:23,040
Refling, stop getting your tentacles with it.

2501
03:03:23,040 --> 03:03:25,040
No, it's not the tent.

2502
03:03:25,040 --> 03:03:27,040
You're trying to put it with your tent.

2503
03:03:31,040 --> 03:03:33,040
Burn them all again.

2504
03:04:01,040 --> 03:04:03,040
Don't ever touch an open flame in your home, if I will.

2505
03:04:23,040 --> 03:04:25,040
Don't ever touch an open flame in your home, if I will.

2506
03:04:31,040 --> 03:04:33,040
They're straight to me.

2507
03:04:33,040 --> 03:04:35,040
I've got a bit more on you.

2508
03:04:41,040 --> 03:04:43,040
Oh, you were right, Refling.

2509
03:04:43,040 --> 03:04:45,040
Thank you.

2510
03:04:45,040 --> 03:04:47,040
What was the other variation?

2511
03:04:47,040 --> 03:04:49,040
There seems to be another variation, is that one?

2512
03:04:53,040 --> 03:04:55,040
There's another one.

2513
03:04:55,040 --> 03:04:57,040
Right.

2514
03:04:57,040 --> 03:04:59,040
Oh, we've got a glace ball.

2515
03:04:59,040 --> 03:05:01,040
There's another one.

2516
03:05:03,040 --> 03:05:05,040
It looks nice and neat and tidy.

2517
03:05:07,040 --> 03:05:09,040
Let me clean your room again, Refling.

2518
03:05:11,040 --> 03:05:13,040
Your punishment for making me do manual labor.

2519
03:05:13,040 --> 03:05:15,040
Manual labor.

2520
03:05:27,040 --> 03:05:29,040
I'm making lemonade.

2521
03:05:29,040 --> 03:05:31,040
Oh, sweet skull.

2522
03:05:35,040 --> 03:05:37,040
I don't seem to pick up that one.

2523
03:05:43,040 --> 03:05:45,040
There's one of them.

2524
03:05:53,040 --> 03:05:55,040
Oh, I like this.

2525
03:05:55,040 --> 03:05:57,040
Oh, I do.

2526
03:05:57,040 --> 03:05:59,040
I see you, little fella.

2527
03:05:59,040 --> 03:06:01,040
I see you.

2528
03:06:01,040 --> 03:06:03,040
Can you open up?

2529
03:06:03,040 --> 03:06:05,040
Can you open up?

2530
03:06:07,040 --> 03:06:09,040
You better unlock right now.

2531
03:06:09,040 --> 03:06:11,040
Oh, we're going to have problems.

2532
03:06:13,040 --> 03:06:15,040
We're going to have fisty cuffs.

2533
03:06:29,040 --> 03:06:31,040
Please open.

2534
03:06:35,040 --> 03:06:37,040
Oh, the hoops.

2535
03:06:37,040 --> 03:06:39,040
Oh, how creative.

2536
03:06:59,040 --> 03:07:01,040
Nothing.

2537
03:07:03,040 --> 03:07:05,040
Oh, the bits look correct.

2538
03:07:07,040 --> 03:07:09,040
Let's go back to the manual.

2539
03:07:17,040 --> 03:07:19,040
It's all good to me.

2540
03:07:23,040 --> 03:07:25,040
It's really exciting, right?

2541
03:07:37,040 --> 03:07:39,040
Misalignment.

2542
03:07:41,040 --> 03:07:43,040
Misalignment on pixel 234.

2543
03:07:43,040 --> 03:07:45,040
Please correct or you will not proceed.

2544
03:07:45,040 --> 03:07:47,040
I repeat, you will not proceed.

2545
03:07:47,040 --> 03:07:49,040
Let's go back up here.

2546
03:08:05,040 --> 03:08:07,040
Yeah, now the bits are stuck.

2547
03:08:17,040 --> 03:08:19,040
Hmm.

2548
03:08:27,040 --> 03:08:29,040
I don't need to put it on.

2549
03:08:31,040 --> 03:08:33,040
I can fucking chop that fast.

2550
03:08:35,040 --> 03:08:37,040
What is this thing?

2551
03:08:41,040 --> 03:08:43,040
You did that.

2552
03:08:47,040 --> 03:08:49,040
Yeah, it seems to be a misalignment on something.

2553
03:08:51,040 --> 03:08:53,040
Hmm.

2554
03:08:55,040 --> 03:08:57,040
Can you?

2555
03:08:59,040 --> 03:09:01,040
Who or what is misaligned?

2556
03:09:01,040 --> 03:09:03,040
Misaligned.

2557
03:09:13,040 --> 03:09:15,040
I think we may have to skip this one

2558
03:09:17,040 --> 03:09:19,040
to stack the book specifically over the wall.

2559
03:09:19,040 --> 03:09:21,040
The books are all in a line here.

2560
03:09:41,040 --> 03:09:43,040
It like bounces it off because it wants to show you the reflection of the stuff.

2561
03:09:43,040 --> 03:09:45,040
Does that make sense?

2562
03:09:49,040 --> 03:09:51,040
It wants to show you the reflection

2563
03:09:51,040 --> 03:09:53,040
so it's trying to bounce it.

2564
03:09:55,040 --> 03:09:57,040
Who goes there?

2565
03:09:57,040 --> 03:09:59,040
Hmm.

2566
03:09:59,040 --> 03:10:01,040
That's a shame.

2567
03:10:01,040 --> 03:10:03,040
Sorry, I'm satisfied that we did that.

2568
03:10:03,040 --> 03:10:05,040
I don't know how to chop this lemon

2569
03:10:05,040 --> 03:10:07,040
but it seems like a half or another thing.

2570
03:10:13,040 --> 03:10:15,040
We may skip it, you do that.

2571
03:10:15,040 --> 03:10:17,040
I think we did it.

2572
03:10:17,040 --> 03:10:19,040
Yeah, I think we did it.

2573
03:10:19,040 --> 03:10:21,040
Maybe the mirror is supposed to go all the way there.

2574
03:10:29,040 --> 03:10:31,040
I'm clicking that shit as hard as I can.

2575
03:10:31,040 --> 03:10:33,040
I think you need to get the mirror on right away.

2576
03:10:35,040 --> 03:10:37,040
Can you do like a little drive by just so the game moves?

2577
03:10:43,040 --> 03:10:45,040
It looks right to me.

2578
03:10:45,040 --> 03:10:47,040
Oh.

2579
03:10:47,040 --> 03:10:49,040
Open it, put it right.

2580
03:10:49,040 --> 03:10:51,040
And then put it to the right

2581
03:10:51,040 --> 03:10:53,040
for the books and that'll show.

2582
03:10:53,040 --> 03:10:55,040
I think it's being a bit silly.

2583
03:11:03,040 --> 03:11:05,040
I think it's being a silly Billy.

2584
03:11:05,040 --> 03:11:07,040
Hmm.

2585
03:11:07,040 --> 03:11:09,040
Hmm.

2586
03:11:13,040 --> 03:11:15,040
Okay, I think we'll go next.

2587
03:11:15,040 --> 03:11:17,040
Is it let it be mean skip?

2588
03:11:17,040 --> 03:11:19,040
Why would they go let it be?

2589
03:11:23,040 --> 03:11:25,040
Skip a level?

2590
03:11:25,040 --> 03:11:27,040
Yeah, it's because you guys are pissed.

2591
03:11:27,040 --> 03:11:29,040
You didn't code it right.

2592
03:11:29,040 --> 03:11:31,040
I got an achievement for skipping that level.

2593
03:11:35,040 --> 03:11:37,040
Okay, we have...

2594
03:11:37,040 --> 03:11:39,040
Oh, these are those chirpy birds.

2595
03:11:53,040 --> 03:11:55,040
I see all the buttons on.

2596
03:11:55,040 --> 03:11:57,040
I love it already.

2597
03:11:57,040 --> 03:11:59,040
I love not having to think for myself.

2598
03:11:59,040 --> 03:12:01,040
So...

2599
03:12:03,040 --> 03:12:05,040
Surely there's nothing better.

2600
03:12:11,040 --> 03:12:13,040
Um, to make a love fire?

2601
03:12:17,040 --> 03:12:19,040
Okay, off.

2602
03:12:19,040 --> 03:12:21,040
Uh-uh.

2603
03:12:21,040 --> 03:12:23,040
Off, off.

2604
03:12:25,040 --> 03:12:27,040
You're out of alignment.

2605
03:12:27,040 --> 03:12:29,040
You're out of alignment.

2606
03:12:29,040 --> 03:12:31,040
You two are out of alignment.

2607
03:12:39,040 --> 03:12:41,040
Hey, that's a good one.

2608
03:12:41,040 --> 03:12:43,040
That is a really good one.

2609
03:12:43,040 --> 03:12:45,040
I like that one.

2610
03:12:47,040 --> 03:12:49,040
High IQ, highest IQ.

2611
03:12:49,040 --> 03:12:51,040
And velar.

2612
03:12:51,040 --> 03:12:53,040
Not really.

2613
03:12:53,040 --> 03:12:55,040
I screen shot the crate image in Marshmallow.

2614
03:12:55,040 --> 03:12:57,040
Okay.

2615
03:12:57,040 --> 03:12:59,040
What are we doing? I'm doing a little...

2616
03:12:59,040 --> 03:13:01,040
guess the difference.

2617
03:13:01,040 --> 03:13:03,040
Hi, pretty kitty.

2618
03:13:11,040 --> 03:13:13,040
I don't know why, but cats really like when they're...

2619
03:13:17,040 --> 03:13:19,040
I got pet them in rhythm of the...

2620
03:13:21,040 --> 03:13:23,040
You mean your tail pet?

2621
03:13:23,040 --> 03:13:25,040
That's not really, like, feels too much.

2622
03:13:25,040 --> 03:13:27,040
You mean your chest pet?

2623
03:13:31,040 --> 03:13:33,040
You mean your ears?

2624
03:13:33,040 --> 03:13:35,040
Okay.

2625
03:13:35,040 --> 03:13:37,040
You mean your feetsies pet?

2626
03:13:39,040 --> 03:13:41,040
Is that all the space?

2627
03:13:43,040 --> 03:13:45,040
Okay.

2628
03:13:45,040 --> 03:13:47,040
Oh, sorry. You mean your chin pet?

2629
03:13:49,040 --> 03:13:51,040
You're a temperamental little fuck, you know that?

2630
03:13:51,040 --> 03:13:53,040
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2631
03:13:55,040 --> 03:13:57,040
I just keep head pounding?

2632
03:13:57,040 --> 03:13:59,040
Oh.

2633
03:13:59,040 --> 03:14:01,040
I was literally...

2634
03:14:01,040 --> 03:14:03,040
over-complicating that.

2635
03:14:03,040 --> 03:14:05,040
That was not too early.

2636
03:14:11,040 --> 03:14:13,040
Okay, the speed is changing, which is why my brain...

2637
03:14:13,040 --> 03:14:15,040
Yeah, the speed is changing.

2638
03:14:15,040 --> 03:14:17,040
You fuck.

2639
03:14:17,040 --> 03:14:19,040
Yeah.

2640
03:14:19,040 --> 03:14:21,040
They're changing the speed right at the end.

2641
03:14:23,040 --> 03:14:25,040
They're changing the speed right at the end.

2642
03:14:25,040 --> 03:14:27,040
So my eyes are like, okay, if I...

2643
03:14:27,040 --> 03:14:29,040
maintain that speed, that's what it...

2644
03:14:29,040 --> 03:14:31,040
Yeah, fuck off.

2645
03:14:45,040 --> 03:14:47,040
We did it?

2646
03:14:47,040 --> 03:14:49,040
Mr. Mittens is happy?

2647
03:14:51,040 --> 03:14:53,040
He's gonna claw you?

2648
03:14:53,040 --> 03:14:55,040
Oh, you're so happy.

2649
03:14:55,040 --> 03:14:57,040
I love happy eating.

2650
03:14:59,040 --> 03:15:01,040
Wow.

2651
03:15:01,040 --> 03:15:03,040
Is this it, J.G.?

2652
03:15:03,040 --> 03:15:05,040
We did it!

2653
03:15:07,040 --> 03:15:09,040
Oh, he's actually peeing.

2654
03:15:11,040 --> 03:15:13,040
Oh, we got, like, a little animation.

2655
03:15:13,040 --> 03:15:15,040
A little animation?

2656
03:15:17,040 --> 03:15:19,040
You're feeling very sleepy, Rachel.

2657
03:15:21,040 --> 03:15:23,040
Oh, they're, like, synchronized swimmers!

2658
03:15:35,040 --> 03:15:37,040
I can't interact with...

2659
03:15:37,040 --> 03:15:39,040
nice detail, I see it.

2660
03:15:39,040 --> 03:15:41,040
Oh, no.

2661
03:15:41,040 --> 03:15:43,040
I'm not just enjoying the credits,

2662
03:15:43,040 --> 03:15:45,040
or am I actually to do something here?

2663
03:15:47,040 --> 03:15:49,040
I don't know if this is the credit.

2664
03:15:49,040 --> 03:15:51,040
I'm supposed to do something.

2665
03:15:51,040 --> 03:15:53,040
I can't click on anything.

2666
03:15:53,040 --> 03:15:55,040
Oh, I can.

2667
03:15:59,040 --> 03:16:01,040
Can I shake his butt?

2668
03:16:01,040 --> 03:16:03,040
I can click on me.

2669
03:16:07,040 --> 03:16:09,040
Everyone, let me...

2670
03:16:09,040 --> 03:16:11,040
I'm trying to, like, drag them.

2671
03:16:13,040 --> 03:16:15,040
They're the only things I can grab.

2672
03:16:31,040 --> 03:16:33,040
Oh, right.

2673
03:16:33,040 --> 03:16:35,040
Okay, okay, okay, D.

2674
03:16:39,040 --> 03:16:41,040
Why did you stop? I drink...

2675
03:16:41,040 --> 03:16:43,040
I take a swig of cola and you all stop?

2676
03:16:43,040 --> 03:16:45,040
Right, keep doing... yeah, keep...

2677
03:16:45,040 --> 03:16:47,040
Why are you retained so slowly now?

2678
03:16:47,040 --> 03:16:49,040
You're keeping me up.

2679
03:16:49,040 --> 03:16:51,040
Who's out of alignment? Identify yourself.

2680
03:16:53,040 --> 03:16:55,040
I can't touch anyone.

2681
03:17:03,040 --> 03:17:05,040
Huh?

2682
03:17:05,040 --> 03:17:07,040
No one's letting me touch them.

2683
03:17:09,040 --> 03:17:11,040
Don't you shake your little butts at me.

2684
03:17:13,040 --> 03:17:15,040
Nothing is letting me interact with it.

2685
03:17:15,040 --> 03:17:17,040
Two of them, please.

2686
03:17:17,040 --> 03:17:19,040
I can't grab any of them, though.

2687
03:17:23,040 --> 03:17:25,040
I don't know if you can hear me

2688
03:17:25,040 --> 03:17:27,040
spam-clicking in the background.

2689
03:17:27,040 --> 03:17:29,040
Emmy's rat army merch win.

2690
03:17:29,040 --> 03:17:31,040
No one's letting me touch them

2691
03:17:31,040 --> 03:17:33,040
literally at the convention

2692
03:17:33,040 --> 03:17:35,040
when you guys realize I'm the sexist.

2693
03:17:35,040 --> 03:17:37,040
I saw an image, actually.

2694
03:17:37,040 --> 03:17:39,040
I was going to tweet it out

2695
03:17:39,040 --> 03:17:41,040
and it was a picture of a woman

2696
03:17:41,040 --> 03:17:43,040
putting her hands in

2697
03:17:43,040 --> 03:17:45,040
a guy's pants and I was going to tweet out

2698
03:17:45,040 --> 03:17:47,040
like me at the convention for real.

2699
03:17:47,040 --> 03:17:49,040
When I see you for real, for real,

2700
03:17:49,040 --> 03:17:51,040
but I was like, oh god, that's not going to get me in trouble.

2701
03:17:55,040 --> 03:17:57,040
I am clicking

2702
03:17:57,040 --> 03:17:59,040
everything that will let me touch it.

2703
03:18:01,040 --> 03:18:03,040
I kid you not, I am going absolutely not.

2704
03:18:03,040 --> 03:18:05,040
I think I might have glitched it.

2705
03:18:05,040 --> 03:18:07,040
I don't know if I should rethought

2706
03:18:07,040 --> 03:18:09,040
something. I don't think it calibrated

2707
03:18:09,040 --> 03:18:11,040
right in this instance

2708
03:18:11,040 --> 03:18:13,040
because I'm

2709
03:18:13,040 --> 03:18:15,040
absolutely clicking it otherwise

2710
03:18:15,040 --> 03:18:17,040
and there's nothing hiding behind my head.

2711
03:18:21,040 --> 03:18:23,040
If you did that, you'd be good.

2712
03:18:23,040 --> 03:18:25,040
Who's going to get in trouble? Management?

2713
03:18:25,040 --> 03:18:27,040
What's that? No HR.

2714
03:18:29,040 --> 03:18:31,040
Right, I'm going to reset

2715
03:18:31,040 --> 03:18:33,040
because I'm not sure

2716
03:18:33,040 --> 03:18:35,040
that's working.

2717
03:18:35,040 --> 03:18:37,040
Oh no, don't make me pass it again.

2718
03:18:39,040 --> 03:18:41,040
One,

2719
03:18:41,040 --> 03:18:43,040
two,

2720
03:18:43,040 --> 03:18:45,040
three, uh uh,

2721
03:18:45,040 --> 03:18:47,040
four, uh uh, five,

2722
03:18:47,040 --> 03:18:49,040
six,

2723
03:18:49,040 --> 03:18:51,040
six,

2724
03:18:51,040 --> 03:18:53,040
six,

2725
03:18:53,040 --> 03:18:55,040
seven,

2726
03:18:55,040 --> 03:18:57,040
eight,

2727
03:18:57,040 --> 03:18:59,040
nine,

2728
03:18:59,040 --> 03:19:01,040
10,

2729
03:19:01,040 --> 03:19:03,040
11,

2730
03:19:03,040 --> 03:19:05,040
12,

2731
03:19:05,040 --> 03:19:07,040
13,

2732
03:19:07,040 --> 03:19:09,040
14,

2733
03:19:09,040 --> 03:19:11,040
15,

2734
03:19:11,040 --> 03:19:13,040
16,

2735
03:19:13,040 --> 03:19:15,040
17,

2736
03:19:15,040 --> 03:19:17,040
18,

2737
03:19:17,040 --> 03:19:19,040
19,

2738
03:19:19,040 --> 03:19:21,040
20,

2739
03:19:21,040 --> 03:19:23,040
21,

2740
03:19:23,040 --> 03:19:25,040
22,

2741
03:19:25,040 --> 03:19:27,040
23,

2742
03:19:27,040 --> 03:19:29,040
23,

2743
03:19:29,040 --> 03:19:31,040
24,

2744
03:19:31,040 --> 03:19:33,040
25,

2745
03:19:33,040 --> 03:19:35,040
25,

2746
03:19:35,040 --> 03:19:37,040
26,

2747
03:19:37,040 --> 03:19:39,040
27,

2748
03:19:39,040 --> 03:19:41,040
28,

2749
03:19:41,040 --> 03:19:43,040
29,

2750
03:19:43,040 --> 03:19:45,040
30,

2751
03:19:45,040 --> 03:19:47,040
31,

2752
03:19:47,040 --> 03:19:49,040
32,

2753
03:19:49,040 --> 03:19:51,040
32 pets.

2754
03:19:51,040 --> 03:19:53,040
You learned it here first.

2755
03:19:53,040 --> 03:19:55,040
Sleep.

2756
03:19:59,040 --> 03:20:01,040
What is that thing? Don't ask for permission.

2757
03:20:01,040 --> 03:20:03,040
Ask for forgiveness. Real.

2758
03:20:03,040 --> 03:20:05,040
Real.

2759
03:20:07,040 --> 03:20:09,040
I maybe get six in a row.

2760
03:20:13,040 --> 03:20:15,040
Right, what did I do? I spun him over

2761
03:20:15,040 --> 03:20:17,040
for a little bit.

2762
03:20:17,040 --> 03:20:19,040
We did the one thing.

2763
03:20:19,040 --> 03:20:21,040
Okay.

2764
03:20:23,040 --> 03:20:25,040
Can you go start shaking your booty?

2765
03:20:27,040 --> 03:20:29,040
Oh, yeah, I bogged out.

2766
03:20:33,040 --> 03:20:35,040
What happens if they all kiss

2767
03:20:35,040 --> 03:20:37,040
and love each other?

2768
03:20:37,040 --> 03:20:39,040
No, they're kissing.

2769
03:20:53,040 --> 03:20:55,040
Oh,

2770
03:20:59,040 --> 03:21:01,040
I understand.

2771
03:21:01,040 --> 03:21:03,040
Sorry.

2772
03:21:03,040 --> 03:21:05,040
Oh my god, it's fun to

2773
03:21:05,040 --> 03:21:07,040
with this.

2774
03:21:07,040 --> 03:21:09,040
You will understand that reference

2775
03:21:09,040 --> 03:21:11,040
soon.

2776
03:21:23,040 --> 03:21:25,040
Okay.

2777
03:21:27,040 --> 03:21:29,040
Is this like a mini version

2778
03:21:29,040 --> 03:21:31,040
of all the puzzles I just

2779
03:21:31,040 --> 03:21:33,040
said?

2780
03:21:33,040 --> 03:21:35,040
I think it is.

2781
03:21:45,040 --> 03:21:47,040
Nuts and bolts and bolts and

2782
03:21:47,040 --> 03:21:49,040
nuts.

2783
03:21:49,040 --> 03:21:51,040
Nuts and nuts and bolts and bolts

2784
03:21:51,040 --> 03:21:53,040
and nuts.

2785
03:21:57,040 --> 03:21:59,040
You, you're upside down.

2786
03:21:59,040 --> 03:22:01,040
You're upside down too.

2787
03:22:13,040 --> 03:22:15,040
Oh, my brain can't.

2788
03:22:15,040 --> 03:22:17,040
What?

2789
03:22:17,040 --> 03:22:19,040
I was driving.

2790
03:22:21,040 --> 03:22:23,040
Oh,

2791
03:22:25,040 --> 03:22:27,040
actually.

2792
03:22:27,040 --> 03:22:29,040
Oh, who's not moving

2793
03:22:29,040 --> 03:22:31,040
in the rhythm?

2794
03:22:31,040 --> 03:22:33,040
A bug.

2795
03:22:43,040 --> 03:22:45,040
Oh, a little lady bird.

2796
03:22:47,040 --> 03:22:49,040
Well, multiple lady birds.

2797
03:22:51,040 --> 03:22:53,040
I'll know this fish again.

2798
03:22:53,040 --> 03:22:55,040
No, I'm not having it.

2799
03:22:55,040 --> 03:22:57,040
Yeah.

2800
03:23:03,040 --> 03:23:05,040
There we go.

2801
03:23:05,040 --> 03:23:07,040
A lady bird, yeah.

2802
03:23:07,040 --> 03:23:09,040
No, boo.

2803
03:23:09,040 --> 03:23:11,040
A lady bird.

2804
03:23:11,040 --> 03:23:13,040
You're pretty-ish?

2805
03:23:13,040 --> 03:23:15,040
Yeah, they're called lady birds.

2806
03:23:17,040 --> 03:23:19,040
Oh, my god, we're getting taken away the night.

2807
03:23:19,040 --> 03:23:21,040
What is it? What are we getting?

2808
03:23:21,040 --> 03:23:23,040
Oh, I like this one.

2809
03:23:23,040 --> 03:23:25,040
Oh, sorry.

2810
03:23:25,040 --> 03:23:27,040
Oh, give me more.

2811
03:23:27,040 --> 03:23:29,040
Whatever that was.

2812
03:23:29,040 --> 03:23:31,040
I'll take 19 more.

2813
03:23:31,040 --> 03:23:33,040
No questions asked.

2814
03:23:35,040 --> 03:23:37,040
I'll take it back.

2815
03:23:39,040 --> 03:23:41,040
Okay, there we go.

2816
03:23:41,040 --> 03:23:43,040
What?

2817
03:23:43,040 --> 03:23:45,040
Oh, my god.

2818
03:23:47,040 --> 03:23:49,040
Oh, my god, please.

2819
03:23:49,040 --> 03:23:51,040
More.

2820
03:23:51,040 --> 03:23:53,040
A lady bird.

2821
03:23:53,040 --> 03:23:55,040
A lady bird.

2822
03:23:55,040 --> 03:23:57,040
A lady bird.

2823
03:23:59,040 --> 03:24:01,040
A lady bird.

2824
03:24:01,040 --> 03:24:03,040
Good.

2825
03:24:03,040 --> 03:24:05,040
No.

2826
03:24:05,040 --> 03:24:07,040
A bird.

2827
03:24:07,040 --> 03:24:09,040
Okay.

2828
03:24:09,040 --> 03:24:11,040
Okay.

2829
03:24:11,040 --> 03:24:16,040
Oh, it's a sandwich. It's a lunchbox.

2830
03:24:20,040 --> 03:24:22,040
Get rid of the crumbs. Go away.

2831
03:24:22,040 --> 03:24:23,040
Oh, the crumbs stay.

2832
03:24:23,040 --> 03:24:24,040
Oh, the crumbs stay!

2833
03:24:24,040 --> 03:24:26,040
Put them...

2834
03:24:33,040 --> 03:24:36,040
Oh, the crumbs would go with the bread.

2835
03:24:42,040 --> 03:24:44,040
Maybe that makes more sense.

2836
03:24:57,040 --> 03:24:59,040
Reflings, look away at one.

2837
03:25:00,040 --> 03:25:02,040
Why is that wrong?

2838
03:25:02,040 --> 03:25:04,040
Oh, fuck off.

2839
03:25:05,040 --> 03:25:07,040
You didn't see that.

2840
03:25:07,040 --> 03:25:11,040
You didn't see it, Reflings. You didn't see it.

2841
03:25:13,040 --> 03:25:15,040
Is that crongo? Give me that crongo.

2842
03:25:16,040 --> 03:25:18,040
The bread.

2843
03:25:20,040 --> 03:25:22,040
The asparagus layman?

2844
03:25:23,040 --> 03:25:25,040
Misalignment and asparagus number three.

2845
03:25:25,040 --> 03:25:28,040
You cannot proceed. Do not collect your...

2846
03:25:30,040 --> 03:25:31,040
Oops, sorry.

2847
03:25:32,040 --> 03:25:33,040
Don't look!

2848
03:25:35,040 --> 03:25:36,040
A carrot? What?!

2849
03:25:37,040 --> 03:25:38,040
I'll get a grip.

2850
03:25:38,040 --> 03:25:39,040
What? How?

2851
03:25:43,040 --> 03:25:44,040
What's that?

2852
03:25:45,040 --> 03:25:46,040
What do you want?

2853
03:25:47,040 --> 03:25:48,040
What do you want from me?

2854
03:25:49,040 --> 03:25:51,040
Who are you? Who are they?

2855
03:25:52,040 --> 03:25:53,040
Okay, this is getting a bit ridiculous.

2856
03:25:53,040 --> 03:25:58,040
Sorry. Right, cherry, lemon, tomato and asparagus on the bottom.

2857
03:25:59,040 --> 03:26:00,040
Wait, what?

2858
03:26:01,040 --> 03:26:04,040
Everything I've done is, like, horrifically wrong.

2859
03:26:07,040 --> 03:26:10,040
I'm not being trolled. Wait, I'm being trolled.

2860
03:26:17,040 --> 03:26:20,040
The carrot refuses to go up and down.

2861
03:26:23,040 --> 03:26:25,040
They're refusing to go up and down.

2862
03:26:25,040 --> 03:26:27,040
Oh, god.

2863
03:26:28,040 --> 03:26:30,040
Mm-hmm.

2864
03:26:36,040 --> 03:26:37,040
Right.

2865
03:26:40,040 --> 03:26:41,040
Okay.

2866
03:26:41,040 --> 03:26:42,040
We did it.

2867
03:26:42,040 --> 03:26:44,040
Sorry, I understood what you meant. I'm jolly.

2868
03:26:44,040 --> 03:26:47,040
Thank you for your infinite patience for me, however.

2869
03:26:52,040 --> 03:26:53,040
I love strongy style.

2870
03:26:57,040 --> 03:26:58,040
Okay.

2871
03:27:10,040 --> 03:27:12,040
Is that supposed to mess that up at the end there?

2872
03:27:17,040 --> 03:27:19,040
Wait, the ending doesn't let you do it properly?

2873
03:27:19,040 --> 03:27:21,040
Oh, putters! Hi, putters!

2874
03:27:22,040 --> 03:27:23,040
Hi, yeah.

2875
03:27:23,040 --> 03:27:24,040
Bleep, bleep, bleep!

2876
03:27:27,040 --> 03:27:29,040
Lost the lid to the upper room.

2877
03:27:32,040 --> 03:27:34,040
Oh, we need to help you claim, darling. How do I do that?

2878
03:27:37,040 --> 03:27:38,040
Okay, give me that one.

2879
03:27:38,040 --> 03:27:39,040
No, get rid of that. Give me that one.

2880
03:27:39,040 --> 03:27:41,040
Okay. New level.

2881
03:27:43,040 --> 03:27:44,040
Oh.

2882
03:27:50,040 --> 03:27:52,040
Okay, please stop.

2883
03:27:53,040 --> 03:27:54,040
Mm-hmm.

2884
03:28:04,040 --> 03:28:06,040
Uh-huh, mm-hmm, mm-hmm. Okay, mm-hmm.

2885
03:28:06,040 --> 03:28:07,040
Yes, yes.

2886
03:28:08,040 --> 03:28:09,040
I'm slaying.

2887
03:28:10,040 --> 03:28:11,040
I'm slaying, truly.

2888
03:28:14,040 --> 03:28:16,040
Truly in wholeheart, like, slaying.

2889
03:28:17,040 --> 03:28:18,040
I need another toe one!

2890
03:28:19,040 --> 03:28:21,040
Okay, he needs just the wee one now.

2891
03:28:24,040 --> 03:28:25,040
There you go. Wee!

2892
03:28:26,040 --> 03:28:27,040
Are you doing it, buddy?

2893
03:28:28,040 --> 03:28:29,040
You're going for the moon.

2894
03:28:30,040 --> 03:28:31,040
I don't even know that one.

2895
03:28:31,040 --> 03:28:32,040
Let's do a toe.

2896
03:28:33,040 --> 03:28:34,040
Yep. Nope.

2897
03:28:35,040 --> 03:28:36,040
Yep.

2898
03:28:36,040 --> 03:28:37,040
Mm-hmm.

2899
03:28:37,040 --> 03:28:38,040
Wee-yep.

2900
03:28:39,040 --> 03:28:40,040
Then a little one.

2901
03:28:40,040 --> 03:28:41,040
Then a little small one.

2902
03:28:42,040 --> 03:28:44,040
Then an even skinnier, malincier one.

2903
03:28:45,040 --> 03:28:46,040
Yeah, I'm windy.

2904
03:28:47,040 --> 03:28:48,040
I'm windy, okay.

2905
03:28:52,040 --> 03:28:53,040
I don't know why it's jiggling.

2906
03:28:58,040 --> 03:29:00,040
What, can I only do wee one?

2907
03:29:06,040 --> 03:29:07,040
Oh, I can't remove it.

2908
03:29:09,040 --> 03:29:10,040
Don't let me add it.

2909
03:29:10,040 --> 03:29:11,040
Don't let me add it.

2910
03:29:11,040 --> 03:29:13,040
I need to, like, fucking label block one.

2911
03:29:15,040 --> 03:29:18,040
The game's actually making sweat work!

2912
03:29:20,040 --> 03:29:21,040
Let's go high.

2913
03:29:21,040 --> 03:29:23,040
It won't let me remove, so...

2914
03:29:24,040 --> 03:29:26,040
Give me a wee skinny one!

2915
03:29:32,040 --> 03:29:34,040
It doesn't like that one a lot.

2916
03:29:34,040 --> 03:29:35,040
But it doesn't want me to remove it.

2917
03:29:35,040 --> 03:29:36,040
I don't want to remove it.

2918
03:29:37,040 --> 03:29:38,040
I don't want to remove it.

2919
03:29:38,040 --> 03:29:39,040
I don't want to remove it.

2920
03:29:39,040 --> 03:29:40,040
That one a lot.

2921
03:29:40,040 --> 03:29:42,040
But it doesn't like anything else either.

2922
03:29:42,040 --> 03:29:44,040
It only is the second wee one.

2923
03:29:50,040 --> 03:29:51,040
That was rather bizarre.

2924
03:29:51,040 --> 03:29:52,040
Hydration check.

2925
03:29:55,040 --> 03:29:56,040
Evil hydrate.

2926
03:30:03,040 --> 03:30:04,040
Honestly, I'd rather...

2927
03:30:04,040 --> 03:30:05,040
I'd rather...

2928
03:30:11,040 --> 03:30:13,040
Because it's not being mean.

2929
03:30:13,040 --> 03:30:15,040
Like, it's not like it's not cycling through it.

2930
03:30:16,040 --> 03:30:18,040
No, don't start wobbling again.

2931
03:30:18,040 --> 03:30:19,040
You're so dramatic.

2932
03:30:31,040 --> 03:30:32,040
I'm losing a little bit.

2933
03:30:32,040 --> 03:30:33,040
Just a little bit.

2934
03:30:35,040 --> 03:30:37,040
I need a wee one.

2935
03:30:38,040 --> 03:30:39,040
A wee short one.

2936
03:30:39,040 --> 03:30:40,040
There's a wee short one.

2937
03:30:40,040 --> 03:30:41,040
Aye, two wee short ones, I'll do that.

2938
03:30:42,040 --> 03:30:43,040
And then, like, the...

2939
03:30:43,040 --> 03:30:44,040
These wee medium ones.

2940
03:30:47,040 --> 03:30:48,040
Nope.

2941
03:30:48,040 --> 03:30:49,040
Yep.

2942
03:30:49,040 --> 03:30:50,040
Yep.

2943
03:30:51,040 --> 03:30:52,040
Nope.

2944
03:30:52,040 --> 03:30:53,040
Yep.

2945
03:30:53,040 --> 03:30:54,040
Yep.

2946
03:30:54,040 --> 03:30:56,040
No, then it'll lean into a piece of me.

2947
03:30:56,040 --> 03:30:57,040
That's correct.

2948
03:31:00,040 --> 03:31:02,040
I'm not sure what the requirements are.

2949
03:31:02,040 --> 03:31:04,040
Is it, like, the colour scheme thing?

2950
03:31:12,040 --> 03:31:13,040
Is it too high?

2951
03:31:13,040 --> 03:31:14,040
It has the colour match?

2952
03:31:14,040 --> 03:31:15,040
Don't see such things.

2953
03:31:20,040 --> 03:31:21,040
What is that?

2954
03:31:21,040 --> 03:31:23,040
Oh, it does have the colour match!

2955
03:31:26,040 --> 03:31:27,040
Why would you do such a thing?

2956
03:31:28,040 --> 03:31:31,040
Am I supposed to just wait for yellow only then?

2957
03:31:33,040 --> 03:31:35,040
Oh, my God, you're so right, is...

2958
03:31:38,040 --> 03:31:40,040
And then I need a skinny red one.

2959
03:31:40,040 --> 03:31:41,040
No, like a wee one.

2960
03:31:41,040 --> 03:31:42,040
Yeah!

2961
03:31:42,040 --> 03:31:43,040
Oh, close enough.

2962
03:31:43,040 --> 03:31:44,040
Kind of.

2963
03:31:46,040 --> 03:31:47,040
Right, I need a wee wee wee.

2964
03:31:47,040 --> 03:31:48,040
A wee wee red one.

2965
03:31:50,040 --> 03:31:52,040
To say red in French, you say...

2966
03:31:54,040 --> 03:31:56,040
You say pink in French, you say...

2967
03:31:58,040 --> 03:32:00,040
What colour is this thing called?

2968
03:32:00,040 --> 03:32:02,040
I can't believe I didn't figure that out.

2969
03:32:03,040 --> 03:32:06,040
So you're telling me I was just getting lucky this entire time?

2970
03:32:06,040 --> 03:32:07,040
I believe it.

2971
03:32:13,040 --> 03:32:15,040
I just need a long one.

2972
03:32:15,040 --> 03:32:17,040
I need a long one and then I can put a wee one on it.

2973
03:32:17,040 --> 03:32:18,040
Long!

2974
03:32:18,040 --> 03:32:19,040
Or two mediums.

2975
03:32:20,040 --> 03:32:21,040
I'll take it.

2976
03:32:21,040 --> 03:32:22,040
Beak.

2977
03:32:25,040 --> 03:32:26,040
Beak.

2978
03:32:26,040 --> 03:32:27,040
Play, dee-play.

2979
03:32:30,040 --> 03:32:31,040
What do we do?

2980
03:32:31,040 --> 03:32:32,040
Grey?

2981
03:32:32,040 --> 03:32:34,040
You've given me grey, so why not?

2982
03:32:34,040 --> 03:32:35,040
I don't know, it's too big.

2983
03:32:39,040 --> 03:32:42,040
Complete the timer by using every available spot.

2984
03:32:45,040 --> 03:32:46,040
Done?

2985
03:32:47,040 --> 03:32:50,040
Where there's the cat under the tree.

2986
03:32:50,040 --> 03:32:55,040
Under the moon and he's fleeing with it like it's yarn.

2987
03:32:56,040 --> 03:32:59,040
Then the cat is over the moon

2988
03:33:00,040 --> 03:33:02,040
and he's purring in the moon.

2989
03:33:04,040 --> 03:33:06,040
Thank you for listening to my song about the cat.

2990
03:33:08,040 --> 03:33:09,040
Now knock it over.

2991
03:33:09,040 --> 03:33:11,040
Honestly, cat behaviour.

2992
03:33:15,040 --> 03:33:17,040
What an interesting game.

2993
03:33:18,040 --> 03:33:20,040
Cat is ascending in the air.

2994
03:33:28,040 --> 03:33:29,040
Wah, a cozy completion.

2995
03:33:29,040 --> 03:33:31,040
Complete the campaign mode.

2996
03:33:31,040 --> 03:33:34,040
That was actually so surprisingly nice.

2997
03:33:35,040 --> 03:33:37,040
Oh well, I get to be the cat now.

2998
03:33:38,040 --> 03:33:40,040
Oh my god, Anne McMillan.

2999
03:33:40,040 --> 03:33:42,040
How could we have done that without you?

3000
03:33:42,040 --> 03:33:45,040
Lucas, don't forget we didn't have you near about you as well.

3001
03:33:46,040 --> 03:33:48,040
We're messing it all up.

3002
03:33:50,040 --> 03:33:53,040
What, I honestly thought...

3003
03:33:54,040 --> 03:33:56,040
I'm gonna say something really mean.

3004
03:33:56,040 --> 03:33:59,040
I thought that was gonna be rubbish.

3005
03:33:59,040 --> 03:34:00,040
But it was, Ney.

3006
03:34:00,040 --> 03:34:02,040
It was actually really good.

3007
03:34:02,040 --> 03:34:04,040
So is VV right or wrong?

3008
03:34:05,040 --> 03:34:07,040
Controversial take?

3009
03:34:09,040 --> 03:34:12,040
Is that Australian VTuber was wrong?

3010
03:34:13,040 --> 03:34:15,040
I thought that was gonna be rubbish.

3011
03:34:16,040 --> 03:34:18,040
But I really enjoyed that.

3012
03:34:19,040 --> 03:34:21,040
I don't know, what do you think?

3013
03:34:22,040 --> 03:34:23,040
Have you played it?

3014
03:34:23,040 --> 03:34:26,040
And if you haven't played it, did you...

3015
03:34:26,040 --> 03:34:28,040
Did I make you want to give it a shot?

3016
03:34:28,040 --> 03:34:30,040
It's like one of those games where you can tune out to this.

3017
03:34:31,040 --> 03:34:33,040
Other than the fridge one.

3018
03:34:33,040 --> 03:34:35,040
Sorry, I'm writing a review on the fridge one.

3019
03:34:35,040 --> 03:34:36,040
I don't care.

3020
03:34:36,040 --> 03:34:37,040
That fridge one makes no sense.

3021
03:34:37,040 --> 03:34:39,040
They need to make it more obvious.

3022
03:34:39,040 --> 03:34:40,040
I said what I said.

3023
03:34:41,040 --> 03:34:43,040
VV, actually VV was wrong.

3024
03:34:43,040 --> 03:34:44,040
Congrats.

3025
03:34:44,040 --> 03:34:45,040
We're gonna have to tune back.

3026
03:34:45,040 --> 03:34:46,040
No.

3027
03:34:46,040 --> 03:34:49,040
Might not stand up to many people.

3028
03:34:49,040 --> 03:34:50,040
No, you can replay it.

3029
03:34:50,040 --> 03:34:51,040
No.

3030
03:34:51,040 --> 03:34:53,040
A good start to a game.

3031
03:34:53,040 --> 03:34:54,040
Definitely.

3032
03:34:54,040 --> 03:34:58,040
I think that's definitely for more casual VTubers

3033
03:34:58,040 --> 03:35:03,040
that don't necessarily need something hyper intense.

3034
03:35:03,040 --> 03:35:07,040
They just want to have a nice chat and enjoy the experience.

3035
03:35:07,040 --> 03:35:11,040
I'd say that was pretty dang bandabi-dosey, honestly.

3036
03:35:11,040 --> 03:35:13,040
Never forget to paint the tools.

3037
03:35:13,040 --> 03:35:20,040
Now, I will say, I suspect VV never actually checked the hints.

3038
03:35:20,040 --> 03:35:23,040
VV and strongy drama confront?

3039
03:35:23,040 --> 03:35:24,040
No.

3040
03:35:24,040 --> 03:35:28,040
I'm gonna guess she purposely did it where she didn't look at the hints.

3041
03:35:28,040 --> 03:35:32,040
Because I looked at the hints, obviously I was like, well, I know what to do.

3042
03:35:33,040 --> 03:35:36,040
It was actually mostly fun because you played it.

3043
03:35:36,040 --> 03:35:37,040
Love the kit.

3044
03:35:40,040 --> 03:35:44,040
I was just so worried when I'm like, oh no, it may be a boring game.

3045
03:35:44,040 --> 03:35:46,040
These things might not find me.

3046
03:35:46,040 --> 03:35:50,040
VV actively avoided the hints function because she's a completionist.

3047
03:35:50,040 --> 03:35:51,040
Ah yes, okay.

3048
03:35:51,040 --> 03:35:56,040
I suspected that because with the hints then you can make it work.

3049
03:35:57,040 --> 03:36:01,040
You could do it in the future to get the solutions you want.

3050
03:36:03,040 --> 03:36:04,040
Do you want to play more puzzle games?

3051
03:36:04,040 --> 03:36:06,040
You could try the Talos principle.

3052
03:36:06,040 --> 03:36:07,040
I found it tough.

3053
03:36:07,040 --> 03:36:08,040
Oh, I'm very dumb.

3054
03:36:11,040 --> 03:36:12,040
It's super fun.

3055
03:36:12,040 --> 03:36:15,040
The alternative solutions on some of these are wild.

3056
03:36:15,040 --> 03:36:18,040
The game works pretty well if you can borrow brain cells.

3057
03:36:18,040 --> 03:36:20,040
Literally, thank you for carrying me.

3058
03:36:20,040 --> 03:36:22,040
Thank you so much for stream sniping.

3059
03:36:22,040 --> 03:36:23,040
Oh no, it's not called stream sniping.

3060
03:36:23,040 --> 03:36:25,040
It's called backseat gaming.

3061
03:36:25,040 --> 03:36:27,040
I love backseat gaming.

3062
03:36:27,040 --> 03:36:29,040
Ah, please do it more to me.

3063
03:36:29,040 --> 03:36:30,040
Sorry, I'm stretching when I did that.

3064
03:36:30,040 --> 03:36:31,040
So I got really late there.

3065
03:36:31,040 --> 03:36:33,040
Sorry if I scared anyone.

3066
03:36:33,040 --> 03:36:34,040
I did a stretch.

3067
03:36:34,040 --> 03:36:35,040
I switched.

3068
03:36:35,040 --> 03:36:37,040
I did big switch.

3069
03:36:37,040 --> 03:36:39,040
Oh, nowhere.

3070
03:36:43,040 --> 03:36:46,040
Are these all the creator's pets?

3071
03:36:46,040 --> 03:36:47,040
I'm going to agree.

3072
03:36:47,040 --> 03:36:49,040
That's so wholesome.

3073
03:36:52,040 --> 03:36:53,040
I love it.

3074
03:36:53,040 --> 03:36:54,040
I love it.

3075
03:36:54,040 --> 03:36:57,040
Honestly, I'm going to say something controversial.

3076
03:36:57,040 --> 03:36:59,040
10 out of 10.

3077
03:37:00,040 --> 03:37:02,040
10 out of 10.

3078
03:37:03,040 --> 03:37:05,040
Sorry, it was.

3079
03:37:05,040 --> 03:37:07,040
That was such a good experience.

3080
03:37:09,040 --> 03:37:14,040
You've got a cute little lane where the cat is winding you up through the whole thing.

3081
03:37:14,040 --> 03:37:17,040
Controversial, but 10 out of 10.

3082
03:37:17,040 --> 03:37:20,040
Literally, I didn't expect that.

3083
03:37:20,040 --> 03:37:22,040
Have you ever played Catherine?

3084
03:37:22,040 --> 03:37:24,040
No, but I'm aware of it.

3085
03:37:24,040 --> 03:37:28,040
And I know it's a puzzle game and there's no chance I'm going to win without dying.

3086
03:37:28,040 --> 03:37:33,040
So I would get too frustrated and start screaming at the game and then close it.

3087
03:37:34,040 --> 03:37:36,040
I think you're guessing a bit too much.

3088
03:37:36,040 --> 03:37:38,040
You didn't like that.

3089
03:37:38,040 --> 03:37:48,040
Maybe you guys made it really enjoyable for me, but I found that rather pleasant gaming experience.

3090
03:37:48,040 --> 03:37:52,040
Now, there's not many games that you can describe as pleasant.

3091
03:37:52,040 --> 03:37:57,040
And this, I would say, was such a pleasant environment.

3092
03:37:57,040 --> 03:38:06,040
The music, the little plot of her little pudders, annoying as, you know, I thoroughly enjoyed that.

3093
03:38:06,040 --> 03:38:14,040
Maybe you made it more enjoyable than I originally would rate it if I was just on my own some lonesome, but that was, I enjoyed that.

3094
03:38:14,040 --> 03:38:17,040
I don't think it was bad, but it's not 10 out of 10.

3095
03:38:17,040 --> 03:38:24,040
When you think of a game, you have to remove what you want to see in a game.

3096
03:38:24,040 --> 03:38:30,040
Because I would ask you, if you don't rate it at 10 out of 10, what would you do to improve it?

3097
03:38:30,040 --> 03:38:38,040
And you have to be careful with that question, because if what you're going to do to improve it would completely change up what the core purpose of the game is,

3098
03:38:38,040 --> 03:38:43,040
which is kind of relaxing, kind of puzzler environment.

3099
03:38:43,040 --> 03:38:47,040
And it's not really environment, because you're not really 3D, are you?

3100
03:38:47,040 --> 03:38:52,040
Like, did the development team achieve what they wanted to achieve with this game?

3101
03:38:52,040 --> 03:38:56,040
I would say, yes, they hit the nail on the head, it's a 10 out of 10.

3102
03:38:56,040 --> 03:38:58,040
You're relaxed, you're playing puzzles.

3103
03:38:58,040 --> 03:39:03,040
Yeah, it gets a bit frustrating, but they've literally got the hints ready right for you to be like, hey, we've got this.

3104
03:39:03,040 --> 03:39:06,040
Now, yeah, we ran into like, I think, what, two unpolished bugs?

3105
03:39:06,040 --> 03:39:08,040
Rather than that.

3106
03:39:08,040 --> 03:39:09,040
Who's this?

3107
03:39:09,040 --> 03:39:11,040
It was pleasant to what you played.

3108
03:39:11,040 --> 03:39:13,040
Johnny, it's a 10 out of 10.

3109
03:39:13,040 --> 03:39:16,040
Yeah, also me with Edith Finch.

3110
03:39:16,040 --> 03:39:18,040
Yeah, 8 out of 10, yeah.

3111
03:39:18,040 --> 03:39:20,040
Yeah, that's terrible.

3112
03:39:20,040 --> 03:39:22,040
I have a rubbish rating system, okay?

3113
03:39:22,040 --> 03:39:25,040
Well, you did already criticise the fridge puzzle.

3114
03:39:25,040 --> 03:39:28,040
Yes, now, whether or not that's a...

3115
03:39:28,040 --> 03:39:35,040
I'm going to, like, if I look it up and everyone agrees that the fridge puzzle needs a bit of alteration, then sure.

3116
03:39:36,040 --> 03:39:38,040
It depends how you rate games.

3117
03:39:38,040 --> 03:39:42,040
Well, you can't go, you can't rate a game objectively.

3118
03:39:42,040 --> 03:39:47,040
Right, this sounds really sad, but I want to rate video games in the future, and like, I did my research...

3119
03:39:47,040 --> 03:39:50,040
I did my research, I'll shut the fuck up, Johnny.

3120
03:39:50,040 --> 03:39:58,040
I researched it into it, and like, you have to remove your bias, because if you were to compare this game to Call of Duty,

3121
03:39:58,040 --> 03:40:01,040
yeah, of course it's a resident sleeper game.

3122
03:40:01,040 --> 03:40:05,040
You have to judge the game based on what the game is giving you.

3123
03:40:05,040 --> 03:40:11,040
You have to remove your bias as well, because my preference is, like, you know, something exciting,

3124
03:40:11,040 --> 03:40:14,040
but I don't want to get stalled in the progress type thing.

3125
03:40:14,040 --> 03:40:20,040
But I need to read... I need to remove my bias in a game type. Does that make sense?

3126
03:40:20,040 --> 03:40:22,040
Makes sense?

3127
03:40:22,040 --> 03:40:24,040
We need an expert game journal.

3128
03:40:24,040 --> 03:40:29,040
I'm going to attempt to do a review on Assassin's Creed Brotherhood,

3129
03:40:29,040 --> 03:40:33,040
and then a review on Isaac as my Donathon Rewards.

3130
03:40:33,040 --> 03:40:39,040
Now, in before, they're just absolutely catastrophic failures, but I want to give it a chance.

3131
03:40:48,040 --> 03:40:51,040
You need to compare it to other puzzlers in the genre.

3132
03:40:51,040 --> 03:40:57,040
Stick to the genre. You need to kind of, like, be able to identify what the dev team we're going for,

3133
03:40:57,040 --> 03:41:01,040
did they achieve it, you know, all these kind of things.

3134
03:41:01,040 --> 03:41:04,040
Finally, yapping is back. Stop!

3135
03:41:04,040 --> 03:41:08,040
Catastrophic. I've always wanted to be a game critic, but that's how I review games.

3136
03:41:08,040 --> 03:41:12,040
Yes. Attempting to have an objective eye is a good instinct, but impossible.

3137
03:41:12,040 --> 03:41:14,040
Hold those both in your head and you'll be fine.

3138
03:41:14,040 --> 03:41:16,040
Yes, so like, obviously, I'll be biased.

3139
03:41:16,040 --> 03:41:19,040
I'll be like, Assassin's Creed Brotherhood, 10 out of 10, best game of all time.

3140
03:41:19,040 --> 03:41:27,040
I've missed out if you have not played it. The graphic, you know, does the game live up to a dated, you know, time period and all that?

3141
03:41:27,040 --> 03:41:32,040
Actually, yes. But then again, I have a personal bias, and when I review the game, I'll say that I have an insane personal bias

3142
03:41:32,040 --> 03:41:35,040
because it also has a nostalgic factor for me.

3143
03:41:35,040 --> 03:41:41,040
Nostalgia is a billion dollar industry.

3144
03:41:41,040 --> 03:41:45,040
Billion dollar for nostalgia, okay?

3145
03:41:45,040 --> 03:41:50,040
The emotional nostalgia cannot be artificially recreated.

3146
03:41:50,040 --> 03:41:58,040
You must have experienced it at a younger age to create the pathways in your brain of familiarity.

3147
03:41:58,040 --> 03:42:01,040
You didn't know your brain adores familiarity.

3148
03:42:01,040 --> 03:42:11,040
It is not like going out of its way to learn new things because that takes effort, that takes brain power, that takes, you know, motivation to learn, take things.

3149
03:42:11,040 --> 03:42:18,040
That is why nostalgia is an insane drug that cannot be created in a lab.

3150
03:42:18,040 --> 03:42:24,040
I could go on a big massive rant about how powerful the nostalgia is.

3151
03:42:24,040 --> 03:42:27,040
You know, for example, you see this meme in passing.

3152
03:42:27,040 --> 03:42:35,040
When you get, like, a whiff of your childhood and, like, you walk past somewhere and you can, like, smell your childhood and you get, like, flashed back

3153
03:42:35,040 --> 03:42:40,040
and you never get the flash again because you don't know what the smell was type thing, okay?

3154
03:42:40,040 --> 03:42:42,040
You know what I mean?

3155
03:42:42,040 --> 03:42:45,040
Honest life, yeah.

3156
03:42:45,040 --> 03:42:49,040
But that's my teaching about it.

3157
03:42:49,040 --> 03:42:53,040
Nostalgia in the next teaching stream?

3158
03:42:53,040 --> 03:42:57,040
Uh, yeah, I wouldn't mind doing that at all.

3159
03:42:57,040 --> 03:43:00,040
I think I may stop the teaching stream just a little bit though.

3160
03:43:00,040 --> 03:43:01,040
Just a little bit.

3161
03:43:01,040 --> 03:43:03,040
But that's okay.

3162
03:43:03,040 --> 03:43:05,040
You usually want to stream or play this.

3163
03:43:05,040 --> 03:43:09,040
I check it out to see their experience with it, but they eventually have it in the background.

3164
03:43:09,040 --> 03:43:11,040
One of the camera streams for this.

3165
03:43:11,040 --> 03:43:13,040
I'd be more interested and curious.

3166
03:43:13,040 --> 03:43:17,040
I was only camp because I knew you guys would carry me through the game.

3167
03:43:17,040 --> 03:43:22,040
You guys would tell me smell and memory near the place of the rain.

3168
03:43:22,040 --> 03:43:24,040
Are you listening to an old song?

3169
03:43:24,040 --> 03:43:25,040
The teaching was fun.

3170
03:43:25,040 --> 03:43:28,040
Literally first day that's joining in goes for four hours.

3171
03:43:28,040 --> 03:43:31,040
Star has already been four hours.

3172
03:43:31,040 --> 03:43:35,040
I won't, no, I'll ramble for a bit, but I can't.

3173
03:43:35,040 --> 03:43:37,040
Is Emmy coming on?

3174
03:43:38,040 --> 03:43:40,040
We can maybe redirect into Emmy.

3175
03:43:40,040 --> 03:43:41,040
When does Emmy come on?

3176
03:43:41,040 --> 03:43:44,040
Sorry, the background music's gonna dissipate.

3177
03:43:44,040 --> 03:43:49,040
Oh, Emmy, are you coming on to this, darling?

3178
03:43:49,040 --> 03:43:51,040
Are you coming?

3179
03:43:51,040 --> 03:43:52,040
Are you coming?

3180
03:43:52,040 --> 03:43:53,040
Sorry.

3181
03:43:53,040 --> 03:43:54,040
Shut the fuck up.

3182
03:43:54,040 --> 03:43:55,040
I'm so excited.

3183
03:43:55,040 --> 03:43:56,040
Sorry.

3184
03:43:56,040 --> 03:43:59,040
I'm so excited to just be back doing long streams again.

3185
03:43:59,040 --> 03:44:00,040
I'm sorry.

3186
03:44:00,040 --> 03:44:02,040
That was wildly inappropriate.

3187
03:44:02,040 --> 03:44:03,040
Oh, stop.

3188
03:44:03,040 --> 03:44:04,040
I'm getting excited.

3189
03:44:04,040 --> 03:44:09,040
I've literally just played a puzzle game and I'm like, oh, not today.

3190
03:44:09,040 --> 03:44:12,040
Okay, I'm on my own some lonesome today.

3191
03:44:12,040 --> 03:44:15,040
Well, we can just be in San Juman.

3192
03:44:15,040 --> 03:44:16,040
I'm so so so.

3193
03:44:16,040 --> 03:44:18,040
Stonny's energy is coming back.

3194
03:44:18,040 --> 03:44:19,040
That's it.

3195
03:44:19,040 --> 03:44:20,040
Any more energy?

3196
03:44:23,040 --> 03:44:27,040
Oh, my YouTube short about how much does a small agency make?

3197
03:44:27,040 --> 03:44:29,040
It got one out of ten.

3198
03:44:29,040 --> 03:44:31,040
Oh my God.

3199
03:44:31,040 --> 03:44:33,040
And you guys are liking it.

3200
03:44:33,040 --> 03:44:34,040
Hold on.

3201
03:44:34,040 --> 03:44:37,040
Oh, I'm accidentally recording my screen eat.

3202
03:44:37,040 --> 03:44:39,040
I hate when my PC does that.

3203
03:44:39,040 --> 03:44:40,040
I try.

3204
03:44:40,040 --> 03:44:44,040
I do a screenshot and then it's like screen recording everything.

3205
03:44:44,040 --> 03:44:47,040
And I'm like, bro, can you not?

3206
03:44:52,040 --> 03:44:53,040
Hold on.

3207
03:44:53,040 --> 03:44:54,040
See this PC?

3208
03:44:54,040 --> 03:44:56,040
I'm actually gonna fart in its mouth.

3209
03:44:56,040 --> 03:44:58,040
This is such a rubbish PC.

3210
03:44:59,040 --> 03:45:01,040
Oh, that's a bit big.

3211
03:45:01,040 --> 03:45:02,040
You know what else is big?

3212
03:45:02,040 --> 03:45:03,040
Mal willy.

3213
03:45:03,040 --> 03:45:04,040
Sorry.

3214
03:45:04,040 --> 03:45:06,040
I'm so excited to be able to do longer streams again.

3215
03:45:06,040 --> 03:45:09,040
And I know I've got shorter streams for tomorrow and the other day.

3216
03:45:09,040 --> 03:45:13,040
Mercy's streaming at 10 a.m. my time or your time?

3217
03:45:13,040 --> 03:45:15,040
Because it's 7 a.m. right now.

3218
03:45:15,040 --> 03:45:16,040
I'm not sure I can yet.

3219
03:45:16,040 --> 03:45:17,040
Can I really yet?

3220
03:45:17,040 --> 03:45:19,040
Can I yet for two more hours?

3221
03:45:19,040 --> 03:45:21,040
Sadly no little sister there.

3222
03:45:21,040 --> 03:45:23,040
The shortest of one out of ten.

3223
03:45:23,040 --> 03:45:24,040
Right.

3224
03:45:24,040 --> 03:45:25,040
Okay.

3225
03:45:25,040 --> 03:45:29,040
So as you see on the screen, ranking by views, it says one out of ten.

3226
03:45:29,040 --> 03:45:35,040
That means in my last ten uploads of whatever content, this has ranked the highest in like

3227
03:45:35,040 --> 03:45:38,040
most generated views in the time span.

3228
03:45:38,040 --> 03:45:39,040
Okay.

3229
03:45:39,040 --> 03:45:40,040
So it's a one out of ten.

3230
03:45:40,040 --> 03:45:41,040
This is a really big thing.

3231
03:45:41,040 --> 03:45:42,040
Okay.

3232
03:45:42,040 --> 03:45:43,040
It means, hey, hold on a minute.

3233
03:45:43,040 --> 03:45:50,040
This is doing really well in comparison to previous uploads type thing.

3234
03:45:50,040 --> 03:45:58,040
So and then it says, so you see how that green dot is that green arrow on views is up.

3235
03:45:58,040 --> 03:46:00,040
That means again, I've gained more views.

3236
03:46:00,040 --> 03:46:01,040
Ten noon.

3237
03:46:01,040 --> 03:46:02,040
Noon.

3238
03:46:02,040 --> 03:46:04,040
I can't ramble for three hours.

3239
03:46:04,040 --> 03:46:07,040
I need to save my voice because I'm recording pregnancy.

3240
03:46:07,040 --> 03:46:11,040
It's so hard tonight and all my collabs are missed out on.

3241
03:46:11,040 --> 03:46:13,040
So I can.

3242
03:46:13,040 --> 03:46:14,040
But yeah.

3243
03:46:14,040 --> 03:46:22,040
Well, number go up.

3244
03:46:22,040 --> 03:46:25,040
I don't know about the Willy but the cake is massive.

3245
03:46:25,040 --> 03:46:26,040
Okay.

3246
03:46:26,040 --> 03:46:40,040
But yeah, it did well.

3247
03:46:40,040 --> 03:46:42,040
Thank you for everyone who interacted with that short.

3248
03:46:42,040 --> 03:46:50,040
I'm just checking the comments and someone's like, how much does your agency take?

3249
03:46:50,040 --> 03:46:55,040
How much does the agency take from me?

3250
03:46:55,040 --> 03:47:03,040
And even if I was a talent, it's 80, 20 and next year goes to 85, 15.

3251
03:47:03,040 --> 03:47:07,040
So the company see this.

3252
03:47:07,040 --> 03:47:10,040
The company see this.

3253
03:47:10,040 --> 03:47:13,040
It's so hyper.

3254
03:47:13,040 --> 03:47:14,040
Sorry.

3255
03:47:14,040 --> 03:47:16,040
I'm sure you're sick of me.

3256
03:47:16,040 --> 03:47:18,040
I'll put my background music on.

3257
03:47:18,040 --> 03:47:19,040
But yeah.

3258
03:47:19,040 --> 03:47:20,040
Thank you everyone who interacted with that short.

3259
03:47:20,040 --> 03:47:23,040
You're super kill and awesome.

3260
03:47:23,040 --> 03:47:27,040
And thank you for looking into my finances for me.

3261
03:47:27,040 --> 03:47:31,040
Thank you for looking into the gen two finances.

3262
03:47:31,040 --> 03:47:32,040
What?

3263
03:47:32,040 --> 03:47:33,040
Who said that?

3264
03:47:33,040 --> 03:47:34,040
What?

3265
03:47:34,040 --> 03:47:40,040
No, but really 12 cases massive for the first month for a beginning agency.

3266
03:47:40,040 --> 03:47:41,040
Yeah.

3267
03:47:41,040 --> 03:47:46,040
I am very lucky.

3268
03:47:46,040 --> 03:47:48,040
Just like how everything worked out.

3269
03:47:48,040 --> 03:47:52,040
Like obviously when I was brewing the girls in my womb, I was like, oh my God.

3270
03:47:52,040 --> 03:47:53,040
Am I making a mistake?

3271
03:47:53,040 --> 03:47:55,040
Like is this insane?

3272
03:47:55,040 --> 03:47:56,040
No motherfucker.

3273
03:47:56,040 --> 03:47:58,040
This ain't insane.

3274
03:47:58,040 --> 03:48:01,040
This is my calling motherfucker.

3275
03:48:01,040 --> 03:48:02,040
I have daughters.

3276
03:48:02,040 --> 03:48:06,040
I get to support and they get to achieve their dreams of being content creators.

3277
03:48:06,040 --> 03:48:08,040
This is my calling in life.

3278
03:48:08,040 --> 03:48:13,040
Just give me what should we do karaoke?

3279
03:48:13,040 --> 03:48:15,040
I'm being so for real right now.

3280
03:48:15,040 --> 03:48:18,040
Should we do pop up karaoke?

3281
03:48:18,040 --> 03:48:21,040
Hold on.

3282
03:48:21,040 --> 03:48:22,040
Hold on.

3283
03:48:22,040 --> 03:48:25,040
We could essentially do pop up karaoke for like two hours.

3284
03:48:25,040 --> 03:48:27,040
And then we can redirect into mercy.

3285
03:48:27,040 --> 03:48:29,040
I think we could.

3286
03:48:29,040 --> 03:48:31,040
I think we could.

3287
03:48:31,040 --> 03:48:32,040
Oh.

3288
03:48:32,040 --> 03:48:33,040
Oh no.

3289
03:48:33,040 --> 03:48:35,040
I have to save my voice.

3290
03:48:35,040 --> 03:48:36,040
No.

3291
03:48:36,040 --> 03:48:37,040
I forgot.

3292
03:48:37,040 --> 03:48:39,040
I need to do ASMR.

3293
03:48:39,040 --> 03:48:40,040
No.

3294
03:48:40,040 --> 03:48:42,040
I need to record ASMR.

3295
03:48:42,040 --> 03:48:43,040
Okay.

3296
03:48:43,040 --> 03:48:44,040
Wait.

3297
03:48:44,040 --> 03:48:45,040
Wait.

3298
03:48:45,040 --> 03:48:47,040
We'll do another pop up in another day.

3299
03:48:47,040 --> 03:48:48,040
I need to do ASMR.

3300
03:48:48,040 --> 03:48:49,040
I forgot.

3301
03:48:49,040 --> 03:48:53,040
I have so many people waiting for me to record ASMR to upload my collapse.

3302
03:48:53,040 --> 03:48:54,040
I'm so sorry.

3303
03:48:54,040 --> 03:48:55,040
I can't sing.

3304
03:48:55,040 --> 03:48:57,040
I'm so sorry to get excited.

3305
03:48:57,040 --> 03:48:58,040
Get you excited.

3306
03:48:58,040 --> 03:48:59,040
I'm done.

3307
03:48:59,040 --> 03:49:00,040
Please forgive me.

3308
03:49:00,040 --> 03:49:01,040
Right.

3309
03:49:01,040 --> 03:49:04,040
Let me open up my marshmallow.

3310
03:49:04,040 --> 03:49:10,040
Don't you have that kind of stream layer in the week?

3311
03:49:10,040 --> 03:49:11,040
Yeah.

3312
03:49:11,040 --> 03:49:13,040
But I like doing lots of streams.

3313
03:49:13,040 --> 03:49:14,040
I'm never offline.

3314
03:49:14,040 --> 03:49:15,040
That's right.

3315
03:49:15,040 --> 03:49:17,040
That's why I make the big bucks.

3316
03:49:17,040 --> 03:49:19,040
Because I'm never offline.

3317
03:49:19,040 --> 03:49:20,040
Wow.

3318
03:49:20,040 --> 03:49:29,040
If you want to save money for the girls, you could link your accounts together with the

3319
03:49:29,040 --> 03:49:30,040
Steam Family feature.

3320
03:49:30,040 --> 03:49:31,040
Yes.

3321
03:49:31,040 --> 03:49:34,040
The girls have full permission to do that with their previous accounts.

3322
03:49:34,040 --> 03:49:38,040
And they get to keep their Steam accounts at the end of their...

3323
03:49:38,040 --> 03:49:40,040
I don't know when they want to depart.

3324
03:49:40,040 --> 03:49:41,040
I don't keep it.

3325
03:49:41,040 --> 03:49:42,040
That's their money.

3326
03:49:42,040 --> 03:49:46,040
I absolutely do not touch any of that because they spent their money on it.

3327
03:49:46,040 --> 03:49:47,040
So they own it.

3328
03:49:47,040 --> 03:49:48,040
Crazy.

3329
03:49:48,040 --> 03:49:49,040
Hi, Duan.

3330
03:49:49,040 --> 03:49:50,040
Hi, Leiflin.

3331
03:49:50,040 --> 03:49:55,040
I watched some of you a little to the left stream.

3332
03:49:55,040 --> 03:49:56,040
What do you...

3333
03:49:56,040 --> 03:50:03,040
And I may have misheard you, but it sounded like you're not doing too well.

3334
03:50:03,040 --> 03:50:04,040
Oh, no.

3335
03:50:04,040 --> 03:50:05,040
Sorry.

3336
03:50:05,040 --> 03:50:07,040
My dad has gone home.

3337
03:50:07,040 --> 03:50:09,040
When I said I'm depressive, espresso.

3338
03:50:09,040 --> 03:50:11,040
What I meant is my dad's gone home.

3339
03:50:11,040 --> 03:50:15,040
So I'm sad, but I'm happy because I get to hang out with you.

3340
03:50:15,040 --> 03:50:17,040
You know, it cancels out the sadness.

3341
03:50:17,040 --> 03:50:21,040
As soon as I click end broadcast, it's fucking over for me.

3342
03:50:21,040 --> 03:50:22,040
That's all I'm saying.

3343
03:50:22,040 --> 03:50:23,040
I'm going to go cry in the bath.

3344
03:50:23,040 --> 03:50:24,040
I'm not even kidding.

3345
03:50:24,040 --> 03:50:25,040
I'm going to go cry in the bath.

3346
03:50:25,040 --> 03:50:30,040
I'm going to fully shave because I'm so fucking hairy.

3347
03:50:30,040 --> 03:50:31,040
Anonymous, Johnny.

3348
03:50:31,040 --> 03:50:33,040
Get us worked up then leaving us hanging.

3349
03:50:33,040 --> 03:50:34,040
That's cruel.

3350
03:50:34,040 --> 03:50:35,040
I'm so sorry.

3351
03:50:35,040 --> 03:50:36,040
I didn't mean it, Leiflin.

3352
03:50:36,040 --> 03:50:39,040
I got distracted.

3353
03:50:39,040 --> 03:50:42,040
My dad went home, so I'm sad.

3354
03:50:43,040 --> 03:50:46,040
Yeah, crying will record in the ASMR.

3355
03:50:46,040 --> 03:50:50,040
Honestly, though, we could always have Twitter spaces.

3356
03:50:50,040 --> 03:50:53,040
I'm going to say something so controversial.

3357
03:50:53,040 --> 03:50:54,040
I don't like Twitter.

3358
03:50:54,040 --> 03:50:58,040
I like putting my projects on Twitter being like, hey, I'm recording pregnancy ASMR.

3359
03:50:58,040 --> 03:50:59,040
Here's a picture.

3360
03:50:59,040 --> 03:51:01,040
Hey, I'm doing this with someone here.

3361
03:51:01,040 --> 03:51:02,040
Here's a picture.

3362
03:51:02,040 --> 03:51:11,040
I don't actually like the concept of Twitter and being like, hi, I'm in the bath, shaving

3363
03:51:11,040 --> 03:51:13,040
my hairy minge.

3364
03:51:13,040 --> 03:51:15,040
What am I supposed to tweet?

3365
03:51:15,040 --> 03:51:17,040
I don't get it.

3366
03:51:17,040 --> 03:51:20,040
In another life, I was basically forced to tweet every day and I was like, oh, I don't

3367
03:51:20,040 --> 03:51:21,040
like it.

3368
03:51:21,040 --> 03:51:22,040
I don't like it.

3369
03:51:22,040 --> 03:51:23,040
Please quit me right now.

3370
03:51:23,040 --> 03:51:24,040
You know?

3371
03:51:24,040 --> 03:51:25,040
Be happy.

3372
03:51:25,040 --> 03:51:26,040
Be happy.

3373
03:51:26,040 --> 03:51:27,040
Be happy.

3374
03:51:27,040 --> 03:51:28,040
Thank you, Kairon.

3375
03:51:28,040 --> 03:51:29,040
It's like TMI.

3376
03:51:29,040 --> 03:51:31,040
It's just no for me.

3377
03:51:31,040 --> 03:51:32,040
Oh my gosh.

3378
03:51:32,040 --> 03:51:38,040
Is that the Fibonacci sequence card from the hit video game, Baltro?

3379
03:51:38,040 --> 03:51:42,040
Thank you for the five gifted memberships math, 16, 18.

3380
03:51:42,040 --> 03:51:46,040
And congrats to those who caught it without this.

3381
03:51:46,040 --> 03:51:47,040
No, don't shave.

3382
03:51:47,040 --> 03:51:48,040
No, don't shave.

3383
03:51:48,040 --> 03:51:51,040
You're so pretty.

3384
03:51:51,040 --> 03:51:57,040
You're so pretty when I can't see the forest for the trees.

3385
03:51:57,040 --> 03:51:59,040
Twitter spaces are great.

3386
03:51:59,040 --> 03:52:01,040
The brain world is already here.

3387
03:52:01,040 --> 03:52:03,040
It's back, baby.

3388
03:52:03,040 --> 03:52:07,040
Hydration chip.

3389
03:52:07,040 --> 03:52:08,040
Okay.

3390
03:52:08,040 --> 03:52:10,040
I'll finish reading that, Maro.

3391
03:52:10,040 --> 03:52:11,040
But I'm sorry.

3392
03:52:11,040 --> 03:52:12,040
No, don't worry.

3393
03:52:12,040 --> 03:52:13,040
I promise.

3394
03:52:13,040 --> 03:52:15,040
Hopefully you know all the reeflings here about you and wish nothing but the best.

3395
03:52:15,040 --> 03:52:17,040
Yes, I'm so sorry to confuse you, reefling.

3396
03:52:17,040 --> 03:52:18,040
Please don't worry about me.

3397
03:52:18,040 --> 03:52:22,040
When I said I'm upset, it's because my dad's gone home.

3398
03:52:22,040 --> 03:52:23,040
And I love my dad very much.

3399
03:52:23,040 --> 03:52:24,040
And he's a hoot and a holler.

3400
03:52:24,040 --> 03:52:26,040
And it's very nice to have him around.

3401
03:52:26,040 --> 03:52:32,040
But the next time I'll see him is probably in like two years time, which was a bit rough.

3402
03:52:32,040 --> 03:52:34,040
It was like, ah, shit.

3403
03:52:34,040 --> 03:52:36,040
That's a rough name.

3404
03:52:36,040 --> 03:52:44,040
He said he doesn't think he can come on the plane next year to come see me, to come visit me.

3405
03:52:44,040 --> 03:52:47,040
And now he would come visit me if I asked.

3406
03:52:47,040 --> 03:52:57,040
If I said quit your fucking job right now and come over for like three months, then he would 100% do it.

3407
03:52:57,040 --> 03:52:58,040
So please don't worry.

3408
03:52:58,040 --> 03:52:59,040
It's not like that.

3409
03:52:59,040 --> 03:53:03,040
It's just it's most likely two years.

3410
03:53:03,040 --> 03:53:07,040
Like I showed my dad everything, like what I do work wise on that.

3411
03:53:07,040 --> 03:53:09,040
And he said hi to AC.

3412
03:53:09,040 --> 03:53:12,040
I don't know if I said it in the other stream, but don't worry if you weren't there.

3413
03:53:12,040 --> 03:53:13,040
He said hi to AC.

3414
03:53:13,040 --> 03:53:14,040
I was invoiced that way.

3415
03:53:14,040 --> 03:53:16,040
He could through just hanging out.

3416
03:53:16,040 --> 03:53:19,040
And I was like, oh, I was like, oh, dad, dad, dad, dad.

3417
03:53:19,040 --> 03:53:20,040
This is AC.

3418
03:53:20,040 --> 03:53:21,040
Say Privyat.

3419
03:53:21,040 --> 03:53:22,040
And he was like, what?

3420
03:53:22,040 --> 03:53:24,040
I was like, yeah, Privyat.

3421
03:53:24,040 --> 03:53:25,040
It means hello in Russian.

3422
03:53:25,040 --> 03:53:26,040
Go Privyat.

3423
03:53:26,040 --> 03:53:28,040
And he was like, Privyat.

3424
03:53:28,040 --> 03:53:30,040
And AC couldn't hear it sadly.

3425
03:53:30,040 --> 03:53:32,040
But we were having a goof over.

3426
03:53:32,040 --> 03:53:33,040
I was showing him my work.

3427
03:53:33,040 --> 03:53:36,040
I was like, so this is what I do for the girls and all of that.

3428
03:53:36,040 --> 03:53:38,040
And he was like 20%.

3429
03:53:38,040 --> 03:53:40,040
And I'm like, yep, 20%.

3430
03:53:40,040 --> 03:53:41,040
I don't want to be greed.

3431
03:53:41,040 --> 03:53:42,040
I'm anti-greed.

3432
03:53:42,040 --> 03:53:44,040
And he's like, yep, yep.

3433
03:53:44,040 --> 03:53:45,040
That sounds right.

3434
03:53:45,040 --> 03:53:47,040
That sounds about you, Johnny.

3435
03:53:47,040 --> 03:53:49,040
Did AC call him dad?

3436
03:53:49,040 --> 03:53:50,040
Don't.

3437
03:53:50,040 --> 03:53:51,040
No.

3438
03:53:51,040 --> 03:53:52,040
Don't.

3439
03:53:52,040 --> 03:53:53,040
Don't.

3440
03:53:53,040 --> 03:53:54,040
You're done.

3441
03:53:54,040 --> 03:53:55,040
You're done.

3442
03:53:55,040 --> 03:53:57,040
I'm farting on your eyelashes.

3443
03:53:57,040 --> 03:53:59,040
Open up your eyeballs right now.

3444
03:53:59,040 --> 03:54:01,040
Don't ever say that again.

3445
03:54:01,040 --> 03:54:03,040
Hi, Johnny.

3446
03:54:03,040 --> 03:54:05,040
Serious answer here.

3447
03:54:05,040 --> 03:54:06,040
OK.

3448
03:54:06,040 --> 03:54:07,040
Emmy and Laura is ginger.

3449
03:54:07,040 --> 03:54:09,040
But in her VTuber model, it's definitely more blonde.

3450
03:54:09,040 --> 03:54:11,040
And tell her she's ed in.

3451
03:54:11,040 --> 03:54:13,040
She is ed in her model, actually.

3452
03:54:13,040 --> 03:54:15,040
She is alternate in...

3453
03:54:15,040 --> 03:54:17,040
Emmy is so fantastic to work with.

3454
03:54:17,040 --> 03:54:18,040
Oh my God.

3455
03:54:18,040 --> 03:54:20,040
We like came to an agreement.

3456
03:54:20,040 --> 03:54:22,040
She's like, I think you guys have seen it.

3457
03:54:22,040 --> 03:54:24,040
So I'm allowed to talk about it.

3458
03:54:24,040 --> 03:54:26,040
And if she doesn't want me to talk about it.

3459
03:54:26,040 --> 03:54:27,040
Sorry, Emmy.

3460
03:54:27,040 --> 03:54:28,040
I love you.

3461
03:54:28,040 --> 03:54:31,040
I'll pay you 50 bucks to not be mad at me.

3462
03:54:31,040 --> 03:54:33,040
Emmy...

3463
03:54:33,040 --> 03:54:36,040
So Emmy's designed her 2.0.

3464
03:54:36,040 --> 03:54:38,040
But I had to say to her.

3465
03:54:38,040 --> 03:54:40,040
I love your 2.0.

3466
03:54:40,040 --> 03:54:44,040
But you need to let Emmy 1.0 be a thing for a little bit longer.

3467
03:54:44,040 --> 03:54:48,040
So we came to an agreement that she's going to get fixed up a little bit

3468
03:54:48,040 --> 03:54:50,040
to Emmy's image, which I'm 100% OK with.

3469
03:54:50,040 --> 03:54:53,040
Like, as I said, I want the girls to be happy with who they are.

3470
03:54:53,040 --> 03:54:56,040
Because at the end of the day, they've been given models, OK?

3471
03:54:56,040 --> 03:54:58,040
Like, Shebe, she's already told you.

3472
03:54:58,040 --> 03:55:03,040
Shebe's getting a more reflective version of herself on a model.

3473
03:55:03,040 --> 03:55:05,040
That's coming out soon to you.

3474
03:55:05,040 --> 03:55:06,040
I don't know when.

3475
03:55:06,040 --> 03:55:07,040
Nari's cooking.

3476
03:55:07,040 --> 03:55:09,040
Nari's cooking very hard right now.

3477
03:55:09,040 --> 03:55:12,040
She's a very busy modeler.

3478
03:55:12,040 --> 03:55:15,040
So please do have patience, but yes.

3479
03:55:15,040 --> 03:55:17,040
It's a 1.5 model.

3480
03:55:17,040 --> 03:55:18,040
She showed it on stream.

3481
03:55:18,040 --> 03:55:20,040
Yes, as I said, I'm Emmy, not Emily.

3482
03:55:20,040 --> 03:55:22,040
Did I say Emily?

3483
03:55:23,040 --> 03:55:25,040
Wait, why are you guys saying Emily?

3484
03:55:25,040 --> 03:55:27,040
Did I say Emily?

3485
03:55:27,040 --> 03:55:28,040
I did.

3486
03:55:28,040 --> 03:55:32,040
It must have started because in a mashed words together, you didn't.

3487
03:55:32,040 --> 03:55:34,040
OK, Emmy, Emmy, Emmy.

3488
03:55:34,040 --> 03:55:37,040
Emmy, Emmy, yeah, Emmy, yeah, Emmy, yeah.

3489
03:55:37,040 --> 03:55:38,040
Drank.

3490
03:55:38,040 --> 03:55:39,040
Swalalala.

3491
03:55:39,040 --> 03:55:40,040
Drank.

3492
03:55:40,040 --> 03:55:41,040
Swalalala.

3493
03:55:41,040 --> 03:55:45,040
But yes, as I said, I'm happy for the girls to, you know,

3494
03:55:45,040 --> 03:55:48,040
change things up and look the way they want.

3495
03:55:48,040 --> 03:55:53,040
But I do need her to still be very close to the original design,

3496
03:55:53,040 --> 03:55:55,040
and she was so good to work with.

3497
03:55:55,040 --> 03:55:59,040
Like I was passing on messages from the concept artists to each other

3498
03:55:59,040 --> 03:56:02,040
and being like, OK, you can do this, but don't do this,

3499
03:56:02,040 --> 03:56:05,040
because you need this and don't do that, because you need that.

3500
03:56:05,040 --> 03:56:07,040
And she was so good.

3501
03:56:07,040 --> 03:56:10,040
She was also so good to work on, so 10 out of 10.

3502
03:56:10,040 --> 03:56:12,040
Work with, sorry, on an objective.

3503
03:56:12,040 --> 03:56:14,040
On an objective.

3504
03:56:14,040 --> 03:56:17,040
And he looked, fuck, I'm dying.

3505
03:56:17,040 --> 03:56:19,040
Sorry, I just choked on my spit.

3506
03:56:19,040 --> 03:56:23,040
I'm trying to like talk and breathe and like swallow my spit at the same time,

3507
03:56:23,040 --> 03:56:27,040
because I'm so excited to get the next question out, OK?

3508
03:56:27,040 --> 03:56:29,040
He found a good bunch of daughters.

3509
03:56:29,040 --> 03:56:31,040
Bro, they found me.

3510
03:56:31,040 --> 03:56:34,040
I don't know how on earth they were crazy enough to go for it.

3511
03:56:34,040 --> 03:56:36,040
Bro, crazy.

3512
03:56:36,040 --> 03:56:37,040
But they did it.

3513
03:56:37,040 --> 03:56:38,040
And here we are.

3514
03:56:38,040 --> 03:56:39,040
I mean, fuck, here we are.

3515
03:56:39,040 --> 03:56:43,040
We're almost at like all of us are 10,000T subs.

3516
03:56:43,040 --> 03:56:46,040
I'm so excited to release that motherfucking artwork.

3517
03:56:46,040 --> 03:56:47,040
Oh, my God.

3518
03:56:47,040 --> 03:56:49,040
Oh, my God, AC is almost 8K.

3519
03:56:49,040 --> 03:56:52,040
Oh, my God, I'm humping to death.

3520
03:56:52,040 --> 03:56:53,040
Hmm.

3521
03:56:53,040 --> 03:56:54,040
Wow.

3522
03:56:54,040 --> 03:56:59,040
And AC and Emmy have a collab coming out soon on AC's channel.

3523
03:56:59,040 --> 03:57:04,040
Sometimes when you get me bricked off, it doesn't go down for an hour.

3524
03:57:04,040 --> 03:57:08,040
Oh, no, four hours is dangerous.

3525
03:57:08,040 --> 03:57:10,040
Are you based on strong heim?

3526
03:57:10,040 --> 03:57:11,040
Strongest strong heim.

3527
03:57:11,040 --> 03:57:12,040
Sounds a bit familiar.

3528
03:57:12,040 --> 03:57:19,040
Oh, I am based after strontium, which is my dad's gamer tag, not the actual gamer tag

3529
03:57:19,040 --> 03:57:22,040
before you look up and be like, I find her dad relax.

3530
03:57:22,040 --> 03:57:24,040
It's not the actual gamer tag.

3531
03:57:24,040 --> 03:57:32,040
But unbelievably, actually, so we are debuts got clipped on this channel called smoothie

3532
03:57:32,040 --> 03:57:38,040
and someone replied under my comment and they were like, are you after strontium dog?

3533
03:57:38,040 --> 03:57:42,040
So this is the even more hidden lore behind my name.

3534
03:57:42,040 --> 03:57:46,040
So strontium dog is a comic my dad used to read.

3535
03:57:46,040 --> 03:57:50,040
And then he made his gamer tag like strontium.

3536
03:57:50,040 --> 03:57:52,040
It's not exactly strontium, so relax.

3537
03:57:52,040 --> 03:57:54,040
And then I called myself strontium.

3538
03:57:54,040 --> 03:57:58,040
And someone commented under and said, are you after strontium dog?

3539
03:57:58,040 --> 03:58:01,040
And I'm like, yes, what the eff.

3540
03:58:01,040 --> 03:58:05,040
The fact even you what strontium dog was was insane.

3541
03:58:05,040 --> 03:58:08,040
It was literally gone full circle.

3542
03:58:08,040 --> 03:58:09,040
Full circle.

3543
03:58:09,040 --> 03:58:10,040
Okay.

3544
03:58:10,040 --> 03:58:13,040
Throw that ass in a full circle.

3545
03:58:13,040 --> 03:58:16,040
And sorry, I'm super hyper today.

3546
03:58:16,040 --> 03:58:18,040
I fucking might be so much worse ones.

3547
03:58:18,040 --> 03:58:23,040
It's so nice to just not feel like stress.

3548
03:58:23,040 --> 03:58:24,040
Now, I love my dad.

3549
03:58:24,040 --> 03:58:25,040
Love me dad.

3550
03:58:25,040 --> 03:58:26,040
Love me refund.

3551
03:58:26,040 --> 03:58:27,040
Simple.

3552
03:58:27,040 --> 03:58:34,040
I felt like I was juggling a lot like normally a nap after streaming all of that.

3553
03:58:34,040 --> 03:58:37,040
And all of that jazz.

3554
03:58:37,040 --> 03:58:40,040
I'm almost caught up with the Elden Ring streams.

3555
03:58:40,040 --> 03:58:42,040
They start up in like two weeks again.

3556
03:58:42,040 --> 03:58:43,040
So I hope you're all Elden.

3557
03:58:43,040 --> 03:58:46,040
I hope you've got like your Elden Ring barfool.

3558
03:58:46,040 --> 03:58:48,040
Can't wait for your dad to be announced in gen two.

3559
03:58:48,040 --> 03:58:50,040
Oh my God.

3560
03:58:50,040 --> 03:58:52,040
That would be hilarious.

3561
03:58:52,040 --> 03:58:55,040
Hi guys, strontium here.

3562
03:58:55,040 --> 03:58:59,040
I would play the clip that I recorded with him, but he said my legal name in it.

3563
03:58:59,040 --> 03:59:02,040
I was like, I was like, I would just record in it so you can see what you want.

3564
03:59:02,040 --> 03:59:04,040
So instantly goes legal name.

3565
03:59:04,040 --> 03:59:09,040
And I'm like, okay, well, I'll need to edit that before I send it on to the editors.

3566
03:59:09,040 --> 03:59:12,040
And strontium's dad is going to be the best girl.

3567
03:59:12,040 --> 03:59:13,040
Oh my God.

3568
03:59:13,040 --> 03:59:17,040
The only male allowed on stream for real for real.

3569
03:59:17,040 --> 03:59:19,040
I managed to catch up to Elden Ring so he can help you out.

3570
03:59:19,040 --> 03:59:20,040
Oh yeah.

3571
03:59:20,040 --> 03:59:22,040
Go kiss me on your lips.

3572
03:59:22,040 --> 03:59:25,040
I'm going to help me in the flower field.

3573
03:59:25,040 --> 03:59:27,040
Sensor the name.

3574
03:59:27,040 --> 03:59:28,040
Bro, honestly.

3575
03:59:28,040 --> 03:59:31,040
We need a model for strontium's dad if he ever comes on a stream.

3576
03:59:32,040 --> 03:59:37,040
So we recorded a short of him guessing VTuber names.

3577
03:59:37,040 --> 03:59:44,040
And I said to him, if it goes viral, you realize you're going to have to get shipped out again so we can record more.

3578
03:59:50,040 --> 03:59:53,040
We would make him our Oshi.

3579
03:59:53,040 --> 03:59:55,040
Strontium.

3580
03:59:55,040 --> 03:59:57,040
The dad tubers, honestly.

3581
03:59:57,040 --> 03:59:58,040
No, my immersion.

3582
03:59:58,040 --> 04:00:00,040
That's my fucking dad.

3583
04:00:00,040 --> 04:00:03,040
No, don't troll when it comes to that.

3584
04:00:03,040 --> 04:00:05,040
I know idol culture, no male on stream.

3585
04:00:05,040 --> 04:00:07,040
But if I'm like, yeah, my dad.

3586
04:00:07,040 --> 04:00:09,040
That's my dad, okay?

3587
04:00:09,040 --> 04:00:13,040
Then he started making me get raged.

3588
04:00:13,040 --> 04:00:15,040
Then he made me enraged.

3589
04:00:15,040 --> 04:00:17,040
Dad tuber, real.

3590
04:00:17,040 --> 04:00:21,040
Since you're a cutfish, your dad model needs to be cracking.

3591
04:00:21,040 --> 04:00:28,040
Well, I'm going to get a doodle of him drawn for the shorts because when he talks, obviously it was just me sitting there staring at the screen.

3592
04:00:28,040 --> 04:00:31,040
But I need to like, who goes there?

3593
04:00:31,040 --> 04:00:35,040
I need to cut up the audio and then I need to get an insane amount of assets.

3594
04:00:35,040 --> 04:00:37,040
The short is going to cost so much money to get.

3595
04:00:37,040 --> 04:00:40,040
I mean, Strontium's dad is already in my kami Oshi.

3596
04:00:40,040 --> 04:00:42,040
You have a father.

3597
04:00:42,040 --> 04:00:44,040
I thought you were a cutfish.

3598
04:00:44,040 --> 04:00:46,040
Wait, cutfishes don't have dads.

3599
04:00:46,040 --> 04:00:49,040
Cutfishes don't have dads.

3600
04:00:49,040 --> 04:00:52,040
Are you getting me to type something into Google that makes no sense?

3601
04:00:53,040 --> 04:00:54,040
No.

3602
04:00:54,040 --> 04:00:56,040
First question that comes up.

3603
04:00:56,040 --> 04:00:58,040
Can you keep a cutfish as a pet?

3604
04:00:58,040 --> 04:00:59,040
Oh, whoa.

3605
04:00:59,040 --> 04:01:01,040
Can you keep a cutfish as a pet?

3606
04:01:01,040 --> 04:01:02,040
No, they're too smart.

3607
04:01:02,040 --> 04:01:03,040
Don't do it.

3608
04:01:03,040 --> 04:01:06,040
Wait, does that mean he would get a Patreon as a...

3609
04:01:06,040 --> 04:01:07,040
Stop!

3610
04:01:07,040 --> 04:01:08,040
Stop.

3611
04:01:08,040 --> 04:01:12,040
They definitely do have male progenitors.

3612
04:01:12,040 --> 04:01:15,040
Some people are that parasocial.

3613
04:01:15,040 --> 04:01:20,040
I bloody hope not when my fucking dad were...

3614
04:01:20,040 --> 04:01:26,040
I'm going to start fighting hands with the shadow people again.

3615
04:01:26,040 --> 04:01:30,040
It's been a day since my dad's gone and I'm already throwing hands with the shadow people.

3616
04:01:30,040 --> 04:01:32,040
Actually, you know what's really disgusting?

3617
04:01:32,040 --> 04:01:36,040
I've instantly stopped taking showers every morning and I know that he's gone.

3618
04:01:36,040 --> 04:01:38,040
Like, absolute minger.

3619
04:01:38,040 --> 04:01:40,040
Absolute minger.

3620
04:01:40,040 --> 04:01:41,040
Hi, Strontium.

3621
04:01:41,040 --> 04:01:43,040
Don't want to make you cry earlier or anything.

3622
04:01:43,040 --> 04:01:44,040
Don't worry.

3623
04:01:44,040 --> 04:01:46,040
It's reserved for the bath time.

3624
04:01:46,040 --> 04:01:48,040
But you're a wonderful goober and we'll never get sick of it.

3625
04:01:48,040 --> 04:01:49,040
If you're ever sad, we're here for you.

3626
04:01:49,040 --> 04:01:50,040
If you ever need help, we're here for you.

3627
04:01:50,040 --> 04:01:53,040
If you're ever raging hard, we're here to get our worded by you.

3628
04:01:53,040 --> 04:01:54,040
Strontium, love maxing.

3629
04:01:54,040 --> 04:01:56,040
We fling, love maxing.

3630
04:01:56,040 --> 04:02:01,040
Get kissed, get kissed, get kissed.

3631
04:02:01,040 --> 04:02:06,040
I just forced my tongue in your mouth when I go...

3632
04:02:06,040 --> 04:02:08,040
Honestly, that's terrible.

3633
04:02:08,040 --> 04:02:10,040
Let's see if that turns out okay.

3634
04:02:10,040 --> 04:02:12,040
Dude, Papa Cuttle's leave as a message.

3635
04:02:12,040 --> 04:02:15,040
Yes, he did, but I can't read it or I'm going to burst out crying.

3636
04:02:15,040 --> 04:02:19,040
I need to give it a few days before I be there.

3637
04:02:19,040 --> 04:02:25,040
But the TLDR is thanks for looking after my daughter whilst I couldn't.

3638
04:02:25,040 --> 04:02:30,040
And that's all I'm going to say before I start crying.

3639
04:02:30,040 --> 04:02:31,040
Hi, Strontium.

3640
04:02:31,040 --> 04:02:32,040
Hi, Bethling.

3641
04:02:32,040 --> 04:02:34,040
You and the rest of the girls are really inspiring.

3642
04:02:34,040 --> 04:02:38,040
Oh, yeah, you're inspired by the autism of your honor.

3643
04:02:38,040 --> 04:02:39,040
Thank you very much.

3644
04:02:39,040 --> 04:02:41,040
I wanted to be a content creator too.

3645
04:02:41,040 --> 04:02:42,040
Oh, yeah.

3646
04:02:42,040 --> 04:02:43,040
Come aboard.

3647
04:02:43,040 --> 04:02:44,040
Clam aboard.

3648
04:02:44,040 --> 04:02:47,040
Oh, no, I doubt I'll ever do an interesting audio.

3649
04:02:47,040 --> 04:02:48,040
Oh my god.

3650
04:02:48,040 --> 04:02:49,040
Shock and behavior.

3651
04:02:49,040 --> 04:02:50,040
I can't believe it.

3652
04:02:50,040 --> 04:02:52,040
You don't want to moan into the microphone.

3653
04:02:52,040 --> 04:02:54,040
But I was way too afraid or too busy.

3654
04:02:54,040 --> 04:02:56,040
But after seeing you guys have so much fun.

3655
04:02:56,040 --> 04:02:58,040
I want to do it too today.

3656
04:02:58,040 --> 04:03:00,040
I've been making original songs.

3657
04:03:00,040 --> 04:03:03,040
Oh my god, you can make the cat songs from...

3658
04:03:03,040 --> 04:03:07,040
You should play straight and then give the music man these music sheets

3659
04:03:07,040 --> 04:03:09,040
and then make songs off the top of your head.

3660
04:03:09,040 --> 04:03:12,040
I find it crazy that Carl Fish is motivating me

3661
04:03:12,040 --> 04:03:14,040
to get back to what I did this.

3662
04:03:14,040 --> 04:03:15,040
Thanks for pumping me up.

3663
04:03:15,040 --> 04:03:16,040
You got to know.

3664
04:03:16,040 --> 04:03:17,040
Pump it up.

3665
04:03:17,040 --> 04:03:19,040
We got to pump it up.

3666
04:03:19,040 --> 04:03:20,040
We got to know.

3667
04:03:20,040 --> 04:03:22,040
Now let me pump your clam with my ink.

3668
04:03:22,040 --> 04:03:23,040
Okay.

3669
04:03:23,040 --> 04:03:24,040
You're done.

3670
04:03:24,040 --> 04:03:25,040
You're done.

3671
04:03:25,040 --> 04:03:26,040
You're done, though.

3672
04:03:26,040 --> 04:03:27,040
Done.

3673
04:03:27,040 --> 04:03:29,040
Well, if you can write diss tracks, let me know.

3674
04:03:29,040 --> 04:03:31,040
Because I want the girls to do diss tracks on each other.

3675
04:03:31,040 --> 04:03:33,040
I think that's the funniest thing ever.

3676
04:03:33,040 --> 04:03:34,040
Oh, strongy cuddles.

3677
04:03:34,040 --> 04:03:36,040
More like strongy fumbles the bag.

3678
04:03:36,040 --> 04:03:38,040
Because what's with that 80-20 cut?

3679
04:03:38,040 --> 04:03:41,040
You literally are not going to get a yacht at that rate.

3680
04:03:41,040 --> 04:03:42,040
Whoa.

3681
04:03:44,040 --> 04:03:46,040
I can go straight, honestly.

3682
04:03:46,040 --> 04:03:47,040
That's what I need.

3683
04:03:47,040 --> 04:03:49,040
I so badly want diss tracks.

3684
04:03:49,040 --> 04:03:50,040
I want to, like, diss track.

3685
04:03:50,040 --> 04:03:53,040
Be a little bit more, like, feel the whores.

3686
04:03:54,040 --> 04:03:55,040
Stop.

3687
04:03:55,040 --> 04:03:56,040
Stop.

3688
04:03:56,040 --> 04:03:57,040
That's not funny.

3689
04:03:57,040 --> 04:03:58,040
Stop.

3690
04:03:58,040 --> 04:03:59,040
Stop.

3691
04:03:59,040 --> 04:04:00,040
Hi, strongy.

3692
04:04:00,040 --> 04:04:01,040
Hi, refling.

3693
04:04:01,040 --> 04:04:02,040
I love you so much.

3694
04:04:02,040 --> 04:04:03,040
I love you so much.

3695
04:04:03,040 --> 04:04:04,040
Sorry.

3696
04:04:04,040 --> 04:04:05,040
I'm getting so excited.

3697
04:04:05,040 --> 04:04:06,040
I'm at 10.

3698
04:04:06,040 --> 04:04:08,040
I need to turn it down to a 7.

3699
04:04:08,040 --> 04:04:09,040
Okay.

3700
04:04:09,040 --> 04:04:11,040
I need to turn it down to a 7.

3701
04:04:14,040 --> 04:04:15,040
Hi, strongy.

3702
04:04:15,040 --> 04:04:16,040
Hi, refling.

3703
04:04:16,040 --> 04:04:17,040
I don't mind if you don't shit.

3704
04:04:17,040 --> 04:04:18,040
Replay.

3705
04:04:18,040 --> 04:04:20,040
Also, don't shower so I can taste you.

3706
04:04:20,040 --> 04:04:21,040
Replay.

3707
04:04:21,040 --> 04:04:24,040
Napoleon Bonaparte back from the grave.

3708
04:04:24,040 --> 04:04:25,040
Jeez.

3709
04:04:25,040 --> 04:04:27,040
I'll rip your bones apart.

3710
04:04:27,040 --> 04:04:28,040
Bonaparte.

3711
04:04:28,040 --> 04:04:30,040
Turn your horse into glue.

3712
04:04:30,040 --> 04:04:33,040
That is a reference to horses being turned into glue.

3713
04:04:33,040 --> 04:04:35,040
That is an actual thing.

3714
04:04:35,040 --> 04:04:36,040
Hi, strongy.

3715
04:04:36,040 --> 04:04:37,040
Hi, refling.

3716
04:04:37,040 --> 04:04:39,040
You know, I want you to get comforted.

3717
04:04:39,040 --> 04:04:40,040
Get comforted.

3718
04:04:40,040 --> 04:04:41,040
Get comforted.

3719
04:04:41,040 --> 04:04:42,040
Pop, pop, pop, pop.

3720
04:04:42,040 --> 04:04:43,040
Comfort, comfort, comfort.

3721
04:04:43,040 --> 04:04:46,040
Will we ever get a horror game stream?

3722
04:04:46,040 --> 04:04:47,040
Yeah.

3723
04:04:47,040 --> 04:04:50,040
Technically, yes.

3724
04:04:50,040 --> 04:04:53,040
I'm very scared of horror games.

3725
04:04:53,040 --> 04:04:56,040
I scream in them and I have a heart rate monitor.

3726
04:04:56,040 --> 04:04:58,040
So, yes.

3727
04:04:58,040 --> 04:05:03,040
Eventually, it's probably going to be like a Donoth on reward because I get freaked out

3728
04:05:03,040 --> 04:05:04,040
in video games.

3729
04:05:04,040 --> 04:05:09,040
I get really good immersion when I play video games where I have tunnel vision and stuff.

3730
04:05:09,040 --> 04:05:15,040
So, that makes the first person horror games 10 times scarier because I feel like they're

3731
04:05:15,040 --> 04:05:18,040
going to touch my freaking back.

3732
04:05:18,040 --> 04:05:22,040
FNAF 1 would absolutely make me shit myself.

3733
04:05:22,040 --> 04:05:24,040
I'm not even kidding.

3734
04:05:24,040 --> 04:05:27,040
The chair would be ruined.

3735
04:05:27,040 --> 04:05:29,040
What was that person thinking?

3736
04:05:29,040 --> 04:05:32,040
I bet if I melted that horse, I could stick things together.

3737
04:05:32,040 --> 04:05:33,040
Can I teach you something?

3738
04:05:33,040 --> 04:05:39,040
They most likely were cooking the horse and then they were like, oh, it went really sticky.

3739
04:05:39,040 --> 04:05:40,040
That's weird.

3740
04:05:40,040 --> 04:05:44,040
And then it did it to another horse and then it went sticky and then it went another horse

3741
04:05:44,040 --> 04:05:47,040
and then it went sticky and then they realized they could make glue from it.

3742
04:05:47,040 --> 04:05:49,040
It's kind of like the cow drinking thing.

3743
04:05:49,040 --> 04:05:54,040
People were like, eh, he was the first human to figure out that cows get milk.

3744
04:05:54,040 --> 04:05:57,040
Motherfucker, you were breastfed.

3745
04:05:57,040 --> 04:05:59,040
Humans and mammals ain't that different.

3746
04:05:59,040 --> 04:06:02,040
Well, actually, I'm going to shit your pants right now.

3747
04:06:02,040 --> 04:06:04,040
Wait, no, I'm not going to shit your pants right now.

3748
04:06:04,040 --> 04:06:07,040
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

3749
04:06:07,040 --> 04:06:08,040
Wait, let me restart.

3750
04:06:08,040 --> 04:06:10,040
Humans are mammals.

3751
04:06:10,040 --> 04:06:13,040
Babies drink milk from boob.

3752
04:06:13,040 --> 04:06:15,040
Boob is also on cow.

3753
04:06:15,040 --> 04:06:17,040
Cow produces milk.

3754
04:06:17,040 --> 04:06:21,040
It's not some weird thing where a random guy taught cow in a field and went, oh, let me get some of that.

3755
04:06:21,040 --> 04:06:23,040
No, it was domestication of animals.

3756
04:06:23,040 --> 04:06:25,040
No, I'm not shitting your pants.

3757
04:06:25,040 --> 04:06:26,040
I'm sorry.

3758
04:06:26,040 --> 04:06:27,040
I'm sorry.

3759
04:06:27,040 --> 04:06:29,040
No, I didn't mean that.

3760
04:06:29,040 --> 04:06:30,040
Shit your pants.

3761
04:06:30,040 --> 04:06:32,040
NO!

3762
04:06:32,040 --> 04:06:36,800
Honestly anonymous ain't no way my Aussie is interested in epic rap battles in history

3763
04:06:36,800 --> 04:06:41,960
Are you kidding me? I love that stuff, although I definitely haven't watched the newest stuff at all

3764
04:06:43,360 --> 04:06:45,520
Be gentle in your panty lin

3765
04:06:46,200 --> 04:06:52,840
What is she cooking something devious clearly? I just want a fresh pair who's gonna clean them your problem not mine. Oh

3766
04:06:55,080 --> 04:06:59,200
No, hold on I'm about to be proven wrong live on stream

3767
04:07:00,360 --> 04:07:02,360
I

3768
04:07:04,120 --> 04:07:07,600
Don't know I'm getting your reference sheets for the girls. Don't show me that

3769
04:07:08,280 --> 04:07:14,400
Don't show me that right. I'll be fair. I've even sent me the reference sheets of the girls. I'm getting your ones for them

3770
04:07:15,760 --> 04:07:21,440
If you want to save money, oh, I read that one. Oh my god. I'm out of our club. Hi. I'm new here to all this VTuber stuff

3771
04:07:25,560 --> 04:07:29,320
All right, I was just making sure you weren't asking anything

3772
04:07:29,320 --> 04:07:32,720
Okay, but I was hoping you could answer a few questions. I'm sorry if you answered them

3773
04:07:32,720 --> 04:07:37,160
Oh, yeah, of course. I wondered if there's a place where you will post your karaoke streams

3774
04:07:37,960 --> 04:07:42,680
I'll be working most likely when you miss it. Oh, I don't host it myself

3775
04:07:44,560 --> 04:07:52,040
And normally archive annons do it all for me. Thank you archive annons. You are the secret hidden people of the good stuff

3776
04:07:52,040 --> 04:07:54,040
Thank you. We appreciate you and

3777
04:07:54,800 --> 04:08:00,240
Yes, hopefully you don't mind if I ask but how would we know if something like cat rocks is broken? Oh

3778
04:08:02,200 --> 04:08:06,880
You just need to replace dot with the word dot and then I'll do the rest

3779
04:08:07,480 --> 04:08:15,080
If you want to send it, I'll just say link archive annons are the seventh member of veal or literally they work in over time

3780
04:08:15,080 --> 04:08:17,080
Their PCs are exploding

3781
04:08:17,240 --> 04:08:24,040
And fucking there they're they start quaking when Azura has a fucking legal edge and streams

3782
04:08:24,040 --> 04:08:27,360
They're little their knees are noblin. That's all I'm saying

3783
04:08:27,360 --> 04:08:31,960
They're noblin and wobbling in their chair when they see you on the schedule that Azura's got legal edge and strings

3784
04:08:32,480 --> 04:08:35,680
They're like no, my my fucking PC is gonna implode

3785
04:08:36,600 --> 04:08:39,040
So far you only had one members carry

3786
04:08:41,400 --> 04:08:43,400
Just a little

3787
04:08:43,640 --> 04:08:48,080
I'll always be here for you and so will the roof and stop being so wholesome to me. How dare you?

3788
04:08:48,880 --> 04:08:50,880
Stop being so

3789
04:08:51,400 --> 04:08:55,320
Hi strongy, you are correct. I'm a is a hundred percent doing ginger. Thank you

3790
04:08:56,200 --> 04:08:59,160
But you are wrong about Azura her hair is green

3791
04:08:59,840 --> 04:09:01,840
It's similar to Hatsune Miku

3792
04:09:02,560 --> 04:09:09,160
You're gonna shit your pants when you learn what color hats and Miku's hair is that's fucking blue. She's bloody blue

3793
04:09:10,160 --> 04:09:16,800
You say cutfish candy be pits, but what about you? Oh, right? Okay. That was good. That was smooth. Okay. Let's do a let's do a

3794
04:09:20,600 --> 04:09:25,360
I need a clap I need like a round of applause. I'll get round of applause, okay

3795
04:09:27,080 --> 04:09:32,080
Back in the pants again when I learned she was a league player. I was like what but you're friendly

3796
04:09:32,640 --> 04:09:36,840
But you're nice blue hair blue tie hiding in your Wi-Fi

3797
04:09:37,600 --> 04:09:39,600
Open secret

3798
04:09:41,680 --> 04:09:43,680
I'm thinking me

3799
04:09:48,400 --> 04:09:53,280
Buzzer's hair is Prismarine. I've never seen that word in my life. Hey

3800
04:09:55,040 --> 04:10:02,080
Marine I'm literally typing in piss marine right now. Is this a joke? Is it gonna be a willy? Oh my god, it's a minecraft block

3801
04:10:02,080 --> 04:10:06,640
I'm so sorry. I don't play I have I have really limited knowledge on minecraft

3802
04:10:08,480 --> 04:10:10,840
Prismarine is a minecraft block

3803
04:10:12,560 --> 04:10:17,880
What is prismarine in real life prismarine is entirely entirely fictional

3804
04:10:18,280 --> 04:10:23,480
However, it looks like aquamarine. Right. Okay an aqua blue meaning war

3805
04:10:24,040 --> 04:10:29,120
That's right. Thank you. It's seafoam. I swear. I don't know is her concept

3806
04:10:30,040 --> 04:10:31,560
I

3807
04:10:31,560 --> 04:10:34,360
Forgot to send away her concept art. So I need to do that

3808
04:10:38,680 --> 04:10:43,200
Hi strongy you mentioned you want to make a diss track for veiler. I just find them so goofy and fun

3809
04:10:43,200 --> 04:10:49,360
Sorry, I do what the crazy is I was thinking that a while ago making your own version of your background music

3810
04:10:49,360 --> 04:10:51,640
Be and then writing lyrics about the six you get on my head

3811
04:10:52,640 --> 04:10:56,840
You silly cut fish I want to get in the studio right now pop pop pop get in the studio pop pop pop

3812
04:10:57,080 --> 04:11:02,880
Hasimiko here is officially blue green. No, it's not. It's blue. She's blue

3813
04:11:04,480 --> 04:11:09,640
All right, I'm about to head out. Good night. Racewell reeflings. Sorry. I keep yapping. I

3814
04:11:10,320 --> 04:11:16,040
Need to go take a vocal rest and then I need to go edit or maybe I'll not and

3815
04:11:16,480 --> 04:11:20,320
Then I'll edit and then I'll record pregnant with you

3816
04:11:22,080 --> 04:11:24,080
But rest

3817
04:11:25,400 --> 04:11:30,080
Hi, mommy. I heard you like epic rap battles, but generally you say your favorite minors

3818
04:11:31,160 --> 04:11:36,240
Definitely Steve Jobs versus Bill Gates. I actually really like the Leonardo

3819
04:11:37,520 --> 04:11:43,640
The Leonardo one the fucking Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles versus the Renaissance ones

3820
04:11:44,200 --> 04:11:49,720
Because although I didn't realize they were named after Renaissance characters until I watched that epic rap battle

3821
04:11:49,920 --> 04:11:54,240
Because I was like the orange again. I guess names of my curse my color something like that

3822
04:11:56,040 --> 04:12:01,360
No, good night. Those who rest Ronnie good night, Ronnie. Wait, are you guys sending me off? What the fuck?

3823
04:12:02,040 --> 04:12:05,000
No, I'm saying good night to that reef Lynn. Are you sending me off?

3824
04:12:05,720 --> 04:12:07,720
Wait, am I a magical offline?

3825
04:12:10,920 --> 04:12:17,240
I'm actually I'm not being sent off wait. I was saying good night to that reef Lynn. Did I not say it in a sentence structure?

3826
04:12:18,240 --> 04:12:20,240
Oh

3827
04:12:23,560 --> 04:12:29,200
Yes, leave oh you're gonna put me in the bath so I can choose I'll do a shave in ASMR

3828
04:12:29,200 --> 04:12:30,960
Why not?

3829
04:12:30,960 --> 04:12:36,480
She could shake it like a party animal. I really want to play view of up in you. I'm so fucking excited to leave you

3830
04:12:36,480 --> 04:12:38,240
But yeah, I'm not even kidding

3831
04:12:38,240 --> 04:12:41,800
Leave up in yard filled with fun filled with fun

3832
04:12:42,240 --> 04:12:43,440
Oh

3833
04:12:43,440 --> 04:12:47,480
Sorry, I love putting my accent on when I sing it makes me laugh

3834
04:12:50,480 --> 04:12:55,640
If you don't go to bed right now lass you get no I nk for a week. No

3835
04:12:56,680 --> 04:12:58,680
Thank you tiny thingy. I

3836
04:12:59,320 --> 04:13:04,040
Mean I could I guess I could go for a nap rather than a bath. What are you doing? I don't know

3837
04:13:05,080 --> 04:13:09,640
What about this thing or it's still not on this PC. It's a mother PC. I'm so sorry

3838
04:13:10,400 --> 04:13:16,080
I'll show this thing or what do you want to see the outro? I can show you the outro right? Hold on. Boom. There you go

3839
04:13:21,080 --> 04:13:25,920
Actually can't hear the music so I don't know if I'm in time with anything, but look it's you on my head

3840
04:13:27,640 --> 04:13:33,280
Getting boycotted out. She's actually leaving got the sensors on I don't even think I have the uncensored version

3841
04:13:33,280 --> 04:13:36,640
Because I used this for debut and then I've never touched it since

3842
04:13:37,400 --> 04:13:44,800
From no, oh my god, right. I'm looking on who I'm gonna redirect into we're doing rare from and you me plus

3843
04:13:44,880 --> 04:13:47,280
She's playing Roblox dressed in press

3844
04:13:48,040 --> 04:13:50,440
What what I want to do that?

3845
04:13:57,840 --> 04:14:00,560
That's where we belong sat on mummy's head. Yeah

3846
04:14:01,520 --> 04:14:07,400
I don't want to you leave. Are you is your strontium copium not gone higher?

3847
04:14:13,360 --> 04:14:15,880
I think I got the uncensored version somewhere

3848
04:14:16,720 --> 04:14:21,120
Starting leaving us after only four hours of yapping. Wait, do you want like a few minutes more?

3849
04:14:21,720 --> 04:14:23,600
Hi, I

3850
04:14:23,600 --> 04:14:26,560
Never left. I'm sorry. I'm sorry to give you

3851
04:14:28,320 --> 04:14:30,320
Hi, is this bear

3852
04:14:30,960 --> 04:14:32,960
Oh

3853
04:14:33,360 --> 04:14:37,820
I'm sorry you can see the cursor in the background is actually capturing the cursor in game

3854
04:14:41,440 --> 04:14:43,600
Bonjour, please

3855
04:14:46,800 --> 04:14:54,640
Next week we're gonna test it out in a member stream just to make sure I've never used test.com or signed up and I don't want anything

3856
04:14:55,600 --> 04:15:00,360
Happening on it, so we're gonna test it in a member stream and then we're gonna do it as a public stream set, okay?

3857
04:15:01,600 --> 04:15:03,600
10 minutes of yapping my favorite

3858
04:15:04,160 --> 04:15:06,160
10 12 hours of yapping

3859
04:15:08,080 --> 04:15:10,800
I'm gonna fart. I fart so badly

3860
04:15:12,840 --> 04:15:15,040
Not gonna lie shaving ASMR might sound nice

3861
04:15:16,280 --> 04:15:21,160
Shaving what my legs are you not gonna be satisfied until you hear?

3862
04:15:22,000 --> 04:15:24,400
Mm-hmm the thing

3863
04:15:26,640 --> 04:15:28,640
Stop being wholesome

3864
04:15:29,440 --> 04:15:31,760
But it's hard when you're cute and came to reee

3865
04:15:32,640 --> 04:15:41,000
We just want to pat you give you kid give you kisses and cuddle and put your prints until you drill and steady on steady on on the edge on the edge

3866
04:15:41,840 --> 04:15:43,840
Maybe maybe

3867
04:15:46,880 --> 04:15:48,880
Hi, Stony

3868
04:15:55,640 --> 04:15:58,960
Underrated whichever for real Stony is so sex

3869
04:16:02,760 --> 04:16:07,880
What is that Japanese mean where that guy's just screaming sex in the tunnel I feel that

3870
04:16:11,880 --> 04:16:13,000
I'm

3871
04:16:13,000 --> 04:16:18,320
100% body shave ASMR ending on the clam that would take me so long to do like 20 minutes

3872
04:16:19,120 --> 04:16:20,640
kind of reefed

3873
04:16:20,640 --> 04:16:22,120
Takashi

3874
04:16:22,120 --> 04:16:24,120
that he grew up

3875
04:16:30,280 --> 04:16:33,680
Takashi chasing pedestrians and Takashi

3876
04:16:35,480 --> 04:16:37,480
Kashi's our spirit on the wall

3877
04:16:41,880 --> 04:16:43,880
Mmm

3878
04:16:43,880 --> 04:16:47,800
Sex and goofy is the real combo breaker. No Takashi your body won't handle it

3879
04:16:50,320 --> 04:16:56,240
Where he's on a bike I'm pretty sure he's on a bike in a tunnel and he's like sex out and it's like bouncing off the walls

3880
04:16:58,560 --> 04:17:00,560
Peak male perform him

3881
04:17:02,960 --> 04:17:10,320
Mummy I want you to know that about my first toy to fully enjoy your audio I had the best ink in my life so far

3882
04:17:11,760 --> 04:17:18,000
The corruption has begun and I'll never feel better than that

3883
04:17:18,800 --> 04:17:20,800
Only when you ink to me

3884
04:17:21,320 --> 04:17:23,320
welcome me I

3885
04:17:23,320 --> 04:17:25,680
Love when you get mindbroken without me even trying

3886
04:17:25,680 --> 04:17:27,680
Ah

3887

3919
04:20:20,680 --> 04:20:25,480
Hi, strongy. Here's my two cents on the hair color debate as there is hair color is literally

3920
04:20:26,240 --> 04:20:31,720
Translates the blue green and my lingo. So she's both Emmy is ginger. There's no debate. Thank you

3921
04:20:32,720 --> 04:20:35,400
Strongy, you're my kind of woman. Oh, yeah

3922
04:20:36,160 --> 04:20:39,400
I'm a huge joker and I'm known to push buttons

3923
04:20:39,400 --> 04:20:42,360
I feel like a fun poking at you until your Scottish rage comes out

3924
04:20:42,360 --> 04:20:49,520
I don't get angry like I don't get angry a person I get angry at like an animate object like video game

3925
04:20:49,520 --> 04:20:50,720
Does that make sense?

3926
04:20:50,720 --> 04:20:52,720
Then I'd give you head pads and kiss

3927
04:20:52,920 --> 04:20:59,440
Your pout is better and cuddle my little seaweed until she smiles. I don't get angry at people. I don't find it hard

3928
04:21:00,280 --> 04:21:03,280
Like, I don't know how to get angry at someone

3929
04:21:07,000 --> 04:21:09,480
Only thing I've worried about with

3930
04:21:11,160 --> 04:21:13,160
Is getting hair in the teeth

3931
04:21:13,920 --> 04:21:18,360
No, no, you're not you're not that no we don't we don't do that here

3932
04:21:20,200 --> 04:21:23,200
We don't do that here you can eat the peach but you're not eating the clam

3933
04:21:23,200 --> 04:21:26,720
Okay, the clam does not want any attention. Please leave the clam alone

3934
04:21:29,440 --> 04:21:35,200
I should play League of Legends with Azura if I want to get angry. I don't I can't even comprehend the game

3935
04:21:35,200 --> 04:21:38,360
I think I've seen gameplay of it three times and I can't comprehend it. I

3936
04:21:39,120 --> 04:21:42,720
Don't know what I'm doing. It's like an enemy has been slain. Well, yeah

3937
04:21:42,720 --> 04:21:49,240
I mean doesn't death occur in this game an ally has been slain. Well, yeah, lady like change

3938
04:21:49,240 --> 04:21:53,820
Well, everyone's supposed to survive no clam attention. They've been a bane another or the beans different

3939
04:21:55,480 --> 04:21:58,400
The the peril of the clam is different

3940
04:21:59,800 --> 04:22:05,480
Nobody could comprehend it at the start. I don't make sense Johnny's hair color is yet. I

3941
04:22:09,080 --> 04:22:15,400
Like my hair. I love the style of it, but I'm a sucker for bunches and symmetrical hair. I'm absolutely suffer for it

3942
04:22:16,600 --> 04:22:21,360
Do you want to just grab my pony tails from behind my little twin tails?

3943
04:22:21,360 --> 04:22:27,600
I do technically a twin tail and I like that is double bunches. You can't see it from the front

3944
04:22:27,600 --> 04:22:31,480
Well, I guess you kind of can I have double bunches behind my

3945
04:22:32,560 --> 04:22:39,440
Seashells I have a I have a ponytail at the seashells create that bump and then I have them at the bottom of the hair as well

3946
04:22:39,440 --> 04:22:42,800
So I have double bunches and I love it. I love it

3947
04:22:44,120 --> 04:22:46,120
Your sucker sure. Hope so

3948
04:22:46,720 --> 04:22:48,720
Twin tail handlebars. Yeah, I

3949
04:22:50,560 --> 04:22:52,720
Love it. I love it. I love oh

3950
04:22:53,440 --> 04:22:57,960
Yeah, no that reminded me something's like oh your character so ugly compared to everyone else. I'm like

3951
04:22:58,560 --> 04:23:04,000
Nice try me nice try. I'm pure six. You can admit it. It's fine

3952
04:23:06,960 --> 04:23:12,960
Only thing I'm worried about oh already read that. How do you oh my god? Oh my god, there's no more marshmallow questions, right?

3953
04:23:12,960 --> 04:23:14,960
I'm going offline good night

3954
04:23:15,920 --> 04:23:22,240
Anyone else in that? Oh, there's no marshmallow questions. I went offline instantly. How do you know?

3955
04:23:22,360 --> 04:23:25,200
Yeah, but the cake. Yes, your honor. Probably

3956
04:23:25,840 --> 04:23:27,840
You see that again. Go rest. I

3957
04:23:28,520 --> 04:23:32,280
Should rest and what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna go for a nap, okay?

3958
04:23:32,880 --> 04:23:40,600
And then I'm gonna go for a bath and then I'm gonna deal with all the backlog of work because the video game has been delayed

3959
04:23:41,200 --> 04:23:43,200
surprise surprise me who didn't

3960
04:23:43,920 --> 04:23:50,800
Fucked up, but it's fine. The game's still playable. That's the main thing and still one-handable if you want. Um, I

3961
04:23:52,360 --> 04:23:55,960
Need to hand over all the audio assets now. Um

3962
04:23:57,400 --> 04:24:00,560
Which is gonna take a hot second to edit but once it's done

3963
04:24:00,560 --> 04:24:02,880
It's one of those jobs that like I can tick off the list

3964
04:24:02,880 --> 04:24:08,660
It's not like a reoccurring job like at the moment the shorts with the girls are like reoccurring jobs and they kill me

3965
04:24:08,900 --> 04:24:14,180
Um, because like it's not like I can take it off a list or anything

3966
04:24:16,100 --> 04:24:19,300
Eh, if Mercy doesn't have a room up she's

3967
04:24:22,100 --> 04:24:24,100
Oh, no, I'm going into rare

3968
04:24:25,060 --> 04:24:27,060
It's not out yet. No, um

3969
04:24:27,540 --> 04:24:32,100
When are we getting the official news about the game? Um, the game is free

3970
04:24:32,740 --> 04:24:37,540
Um free access. It will be uh posted on the alternative twitters

3971
04:24:37,540 --> 04:24:41,140
It will not be posted from the main account due to the content

3972
04:24:42,180 --> 04:24:45,140
Like the main VLR account due to the content inside the game

3973
04:24:46,180 --> 04:24:47,700
Can you post that?

3974
04:24:47,700 --> 04:24:49,700
Can you post that now you can so

3975
04:24:52,580 --> 04:24:54,580
I mean, maybe we could

3976
04:24:55,220 --> 04:25:00,660
Do it announce it, but then link the girls all no no, it's too risky. It's too risky. I'm not risking. I'm not risking it

3977
04:25:01,540 --> 04:25:04,980
Uh, also the girls are getting access to fansly on august 1st, so

3978
04:25:05,060 --> 04:25:07,060
Do without what you will

3979
04:25:09,220 --> 04:25:14,020
I don't know what they're planning, but how about you? What kind of content?

3980
04:25:16,740 --> 04:25:18,740
One-handed gameplay content

3981
04:25:21,540 --> 04:25:25,300
So play with headphones. Yeah, definitely

3982
04:25:27,300 --> 04:25:29,860
Um getting the debit card ready

3983
04:25:30,740 --> 04:25:35,540
We will be there, but when are you gonna be on it? I need a bit more

3984
04:25:36,100 --> 04:25:42,660
Time and what I'm gonna purposely do is let the girls go ahead and do what they want to like get as much support for them

3985
04:25:43,060 --> 04:25:45,060
Because they actually get 100 of their

3986
04:25:45,860 --> 04:25:48,420
VLR don't take any cut from their bandslay at all

3987
04:25:48,820 --> 04:25:53,380
Um, so I'd rather they like get success and like more stabilized income if they want to do it

3988
04:25:53,380 --> 04:25:56,100
But I have requested them like hey remember

3989
04:25:56,340 --> 04:26:02,740
YouTube's your main income source like don't don't be cut. I said to them and actually you can quote this the girls will quote that

3990
04:26:02,740 --> 04:26:06,980
I said don't come to me with five bandsly streams on your schedule

3991
04:26:07,860 --> 04:26:09,860
And they all agreed and they said yeah, that's fine

3992
04:26:10,660 --> 04:26:12,660
Yeah, hold on. I'm hydrating

3993
04:26:17,620 --> 04:26:24,260
Don't feel send on bad. Yeah, I said look hey your income sources YouTube like then he didn't mess this up

3994
04:26:26,900 --> 04:26:32,580
And the price is going to be same completely up to the girl. We do not take any cut from

3995
04:26:34,020 --> 04:26:35,460
Uh

3996
04:26:35,460 --> 04:26:40,260
We do not take any cut so we don't dictate the price the girls pick their prices whatever they're happy with

3997
04:26:40,980 --> 04:26:46,580
And not up to be aware of the agency because it's not stipulated in the contract at all

3998
04:26:46,980 --> 04:26:53,700
Um, are you winning son? Yeah, we defeated the enemy of the puzzle game, which is actually a really good game recommend

3999
04:26:54,020 --> 04:27:01,780
Say strong reeflings. Don't give her ideas. The zeroes will play for 40 hours straight. Stop. What if a zero plays the league on that? No

4000
04:27:03,620 --> 04:27:05,620
Yeah, she's gonna spank him

4001
04:27:06,660 --> 04:27:08,660
I stayed up past my bedtime to watch so the

4002
04:27:09,700 --> 04:27:11,700
the fun

4003
04:27:14,020 --> 04:27:17,540
As in your adult working bedtime

4004
04:27:19,620 --> 04:27:22,520
Not child bedtime

4005
04:27:23,780 --> 04:27:25,780
Right

4006
04:27:28,260 --> 04:27:30,500
Is there a fucking answer are you about to get yeeted?

4007
04:27:34,020 --> 04:27:39,300
Okay, proud of you son. A lot of the girls will play the game. Yes, they will. I'm gonna ask them to

4008
04:27:41,460 --> 04:27:43,700
Whoa, strongy you could be a healer

4009
04:27:44,580 --> 04:27:46,580
Honestly, well, I have the one

4010
04:27:47,620 --> 04:27:52,420
That goes in the back door. You know how there's like those those pink ones

4011
04:27:53,140 --> 04:27:55,300
That go in the clam. I don't have that one

4012
04:27:56,420 --> 04:28:01,140
I have the other one and I think I think I can get you guys to control it sometimes

4013
04:28:02,820 --> 04:28:05,540
I need to I need to invest them again

4014
04:28:06,740 --> 04:28:08,740

Well, let's catch the word but no, okay. We're good. We're good

4019
04:28:30,500 --> 04:28:32,500
I can no longer think coherently

4020
04:28:36,660 --> 04:28:41,860
We may also have a sponsorship actually on the video again that is not for

4021

Oh, I'm just just broken my youtube account. Why not all because I want to make the thumbnail accurate to the game

4041

Are you gonna have collapse with other girls on patreon outside the agency?

4048
04:30:56,980 --> 04:31:01,460
No, it's not planned at the moment. It's very difficult to plan and all honestly

4049
04:31:02,020 --> 04:31:07,540
Um, hi strunny. You're my perfect woman. You're really further woman. Oh, no. I'm not I'm not like in a bad way you mean like

04:31:13,060 --> 04:31:15,060
No for me it's still the old thumbnail

4052
04:31:15,460 --> 04:31:18,260
Right I go and I'll rest and then I'll grab a bath

4058
04:31:37,780 --> 04:31:43,220
I'm gonna get going I'll add timestamps for any vod watchers because I've been trying to be good to go back and add

4059
04:31:43,460 --> 04:31:46,660
Timestamps because obviously I do pre-game yeah for them post-game yeah

But yeah, quickly challenged. Yeah, basically quickly challenge

4061
04:31:54,580 --> 04:31:58,980
Uh, we're playing roller coaster tycoon tomorrow. I don't know if we can get through the campaign

4062
04:31:59,060 --> 04:32:02,980
I can't recall how long the campaign is but it'll be interesting

4063
04:32:03,060 --> 04:32:06,100
I'm not gonna build a roller coaster though because I don't know how to do it

4064
04:32:07,460 --> 04:32:08,980
Okay

4065
04:32:08,980 --> 04:32:13,940
I'll see you goofy gobers tomorrow. Thank you so much. Shibi got home an hour ago

4066
04:32:16,260 --> 04:32:21,220
I'll need to send her a message to make sure she's all hydrated because you get really dehydrated on planes apparently

4067
04:32:21,700 --> 04:32:27,140
But thank you so much for the longer stream as weird calling a forever stream a longer stream lies

4068
04:32:27,620 --> 04:32:29,620
Lies, it's not a long stream

4069
04:32:29,860 --> 04:32:34,980
But as I said the endurance picks up again next week not this week next week

4070
04:32:35,060 --> 04:32:39,540
I'm gonna also put up the rest of my weight rooms as well because they're all lurking in the shadows

4071
04:32:40,500 --> 04:32:45,220
But yes, I see you goofy gobers tomorrow. I love you and I give you a bit

4072
04:32:46,500 --> 04:32:48,500
That's right. I caught you by surprise

4073
04:32:48,980 --> 04:32:50,980
I didn't even let you pick her up

4074
04:32:51,220 --> 04:32:53,220
Mmm

4075
04:32:54,420 --> 04:32:56,420
Did you like that?

4076
04:33:00,180 --> 04:33:02,500
I see you tomorrow. Please enjoy vea and as always

4077
04:33:03,860 --> 04:33:09,060
