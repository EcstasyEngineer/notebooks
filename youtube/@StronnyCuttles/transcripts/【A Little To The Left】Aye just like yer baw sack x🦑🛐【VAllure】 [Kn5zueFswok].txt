okay
alright alright alright alright alright
mom oh I'm so tiny
yeah a little bit
my baby don't mess around because there's something else and then she told me so
black cats and then and then
but I know for sure
oh oh sorry you just caught me
warming up for my future karaoke stream
oh no I'm so embarrassed
I can't believe you caught me like that
oh um good morning
good evening and uh good afternoon
who's that going? who's that going?
on 4k bro
as if I didn't orchestrate that bye bye
okay she's in the ash kitchen voice again
hiya America hiya
good morning
uh I haven't add in front of the stream
no you shouldn't have I've told YouTube not to do this specifically
that's not right hold on hold it
fucking monetization
choose when mid rolls appear insert them manually
YouTube's taking the piss
because I haven't put ads on I don't put ads on on live streams
are they forcing ads on live streams there?
they better not be I'm gonna fart
I'm gonna do it okay
I get ads on my phone
um that'll be YouTube pocket in the full ad then
what did I just walk into?
I don't know
please don't think about me like that
okay got a bit of an update
Mercy's emotes approved I'm just waiting for the delivery so they could be thingied
there was two mistakes with Azur's emotes
so I had to pay an extra couple of dollars do's
but the sneaky little sneaker tins
they extended the delivery time by three weeks to fix two emotes
and they already have taken quite a while
so I need to wait until Mercy and Azur's batch of 10 are done
before I can order everyone else's missing slot emotes
is that my sense?
so I can't do anything yet
my hands are tied
my hands are tied okay
but not to be confused my hand can't
okay as for the updates again
bleeding hearts, reflins, both the user in the same club
I'll need to sleep after the stream
and then I will get the third audio up
my audio is beam of fur babacucation
and Azur's is landlord lips never felt so okay
who wrote that? it was me at the time
it was absolutely outrageous behaviour
honestly outrageous
is that doom music playing in the background?
but I hope not
there shouldn't be any music playing in the background
this is what plays in the background
but it's a bit sad
but anyway
got an update
me dad
me dad's officially
fucked off
nah it's true, papacuttle's is heading home
so
now I do have two more streams of shorter games
just so I can catch up on the ASMR I need to record
because I need to record about 3 hours worth of shit I'm missing
but the good news is
it lets me catch up on all my work
now I do have a message for your reflins
but I can't read it yet or I'm gonna cry
so I'll read it tomorrow
I can't read it today
or I'll greet my eyes out
I miss pap already
aww I miss him too I was so sad
both of us were like
I was like I didn't want to cry in front of him
as he was going
so I was like
so there's this fucking meme for this stupid thing
I don't know what it is
but the meme goes
be strong, Clarence be strong for mama
and that's what goes in my head
when I try and tell myself not to laugh
not to cry sorry
like to try and cheer me up
I can't remember what the meme is
but it's like be strong, Clarence be strong for mama
so he didn't see me cry
but as soon as like
I couldn't see him anymore
oh god I'm getting emotional
ok we're playing a little to the left today
which is a puzzle game ok
now as well no puzzle game
so it's my biggest enemy
because it requires IQ
that I do not possess
in any way shape or form
thank you GothMommyBee
for becoming a member
enjoy those emotions
I have four more on the way
I think there's four more slots
bye strong
be strong for the refling
it's a TISM game
oh god

it's like a mash of a dodo
one of the dodo birds
it's wrong

vtubers actually make
and I'm not just gonna dance around the question
wait hold on let me link it
right I'll give you that before we get into
I need to do the
I need to do the repromotional bit here
the red spies in the base legit honestly
best short yet
I got a short and then I asked the question
and I actually answered the question
in the short
oh my god
VTuber challenge complete
asked the question and actually
answered it in a short
oh let's go man
the numbers were
very impressive
right so some of you might not know this
I got a thousand dollar donation
completely anonymous
near request not an else attached
couldn't give life of a shit
just gives me a thousand dollars and pisses off like oh
so that's the truth but yeah
that's great short but the IRS jump
skewer is not appreciate
bro if you need to hold 30% back or the IRS
is literally ready to like
I'm gonna dick you
down like that
there you go
and it's for sure not sabotage
maybe from this one someone was like
remember that time you were worried about funding
gen 2 and I'm like
honestly
just off it you're making me blush
like real real
actually real okay let me just
slurp my tea
also nice to meet everyone
hi
thanks for joining for that first time
I'm strong enough
unfortunately I'm Scottish but
the good thing is it gives me frost resistance
so it's not bad
if you would like
to consider yourself
an enjoyer of me
you can refer to yourself
as a replay
or replay
when you came and you gave me a
kiss
I reached a round
and
you got a thousand dollar dono
what about Emmy's 400 dono
it's getting clipped and shipped
it's already been sent for editing purposes
so
identify as an ord
I am translucent with how pale I am
you can see my entire vascular
system at a glance
that's how pale I am
I literally have hues
of purple and blue thanks to
my veins that I am that pale
so I would consider myself a
Nord and the name of the Nord
I pray to the Lord you all get a taste
of my blade and my sword I'm taking on
what's that Emmy's
purple yes if you
have very translucent skin
veins can appear purple and I have
very almost purple esk under
my eyeballs and relay which means I'm
perfect for being a girl
oh my god that was a voice crack
voice crack
also we saw the ring fit stream
I assume you haven't seen sunlight in years how
dare you
he spoke nothing but the truth I'm
insulted by such words
and yet no true words were spoken in that
moment my goodness
you could probably put it to scripture that's
so truthful he was being in that moment
aww absolutely annihilated
honestly sun gets reflect
I can't go outside without fully closed
it'll be like
well it's winter right now so it doesn't
wait what's next
my wires
sorry if I seem like
fucking hyper I'm like
super sad inside but I'm really glad I get to
talk to you Evelyn I'd be a puddle
right now and I just
thought this game was gonna go shite because
it's a fucking puzzle game
it requires IQ
the beacons are lit have you slept
so I
stayed up last night
writing scripts for the girls
so
AC has a script
about scratching your back
because obviously she's a polar bear and she's got
claws right so
I
wrote a script about AC that she gives you like back
scratches in the middle of the night and she has
her sleepy voice on okay
and then I wrote one for
Mercy where it's Yandere
it gives you a haircut while she's tied you up
in your bed ASMR
it's the most bizarre thing I've ever written in my life
are you squiddin me right now
I'm fucking giggling away at myself over it
and then Azura's is a
dummy mummy
praises you in your sleep
ASMR I've not finished Azura's
but I'm about to
but I sent it to Mercy and Mercy's like oh
I actually wrote some stuff for myself
and then Azura was like oh I actually
got some stuff to do YouTube ASMR
with and I'm like
my daughters don't even need me
I'm being outsourced already
Tim Schottel thank you for the tip
love the new short your open book
just as open as my legs baby
well I tried
and it's very interesting to see the things
that people don't share you are amazing
thank you I appreciate it
yeah I
personally I have
problems being like this is what it looks like
behind the scenes because I think a lot of people
don't get the opportunity to really see
that which is why I want to be like
hey we might be a small
agency but I did put a bit
of thought behind you know
gets an exchange of services and
trying to earn my money you know
I might be shocking
but mummy
what is bigger your first month's paycheck
for beach ever are you
long what
I don't
I mean I'm technically
five inches
what is that
they're all grown up outsourced in the first
month honestly
I've got a collab with AC and Emmy
to write but so there's one
on Emmy's channel of her and AC
but I need to do it the other way
around and I think I want to do it
like Bratz give you a haircut
because I need to record new haircut sounds
well piss
what I'm so sorry that was my accent
let me try that again
thank you for becoming a member I'm so sorry
I said piss in your name there's not it's just
I just can't read properly
I'm so sorry I think I might do like
two Bratz cut your hair in the middle of the
night for Emmy and AC and they're whispering
to themselves about how mischievous
they both are and then you just get like
back like over the cheek
and then like kind of like the midnight
barber mean for the mighty bush if you've
ever seen that it's about a British
comedy yeah
but it's got to be
those units don't compare
you know what compares
me and you
I'm sorry
we missed up we gotta go but oh that's how I
should end it oh shit we missed up
we gotta go
I think strongy call me
I know it's okay it's a hard name
just say I just don't make it easy
oh my god can't believe you're not making it
easy for me
this is
this is my time joining a violer stream and I know this
is adult agency and I mean
very adult by adult I mean jerking my
pintas but I'm curious on whether or not
it's a nice and welcoming community as well
as the others yes it's
a misconception that we are literally
humping the screen 24-7 on youtube
nope that's that's not what we are
however I do love challenging
a bit of a misconception anyway
off to a conspiracy theory stream
hi I'm strongy I have
five other gen mates if I am not
your flavour please do check
them out they are a lot more nicer
sounding than me and have a better
train of thought if you like
yappers sheevy cotton bomb
is the one for you if you like
an absolutely adorable
yandere vibe
merci modiste is for you
if you are into the more forbidden
things in life my friend
oh boy do I have a girl for you
her name is emi bezu do not translate
that name you will get in trouble
and be put on a list okay
now if you like
a very close experience

d-d-l-g

MUMMY MILKERS
azura duly
those are your choices
those are your choices

everyone needs a weakness okay
azuras just happens to be league of legends
everyone needs a little thingy

you mean fortunately you're Scottish
I SHITE ME IN SCHOOL

also start up
not gonna lie
being addicted to league is a huge deal
like everyone needs a weakness
my weakness is like I'm literally
I'm not allowed to say that cause it will
worry you guys
I'm not allowed to say that
being British is your weakness
no that's probably what it is
I get considered British cause technically
you know United Kingdom, Scotland
however
however
yes
I'm not gonna lie
first agency I liked all the members
and I actually sit through the streams
so
obviously
the girls are free to discuss their PL
stuff but I've kinda said this
like everyone got picked cause I saw a bit
of myself in them
and I have a bias for the underdog
I don't give a shit
if you think that's a bad whatever
I like the underdog
obviously the only exception is kinda
me the Emmy if you want to get
takey spaky
but Emmy
Emmy
was I've said this before
Emmy was quite inquisitive during the interview stage
and she was like
asking how it would work behind the scenes
and she was very keen to start on something new
and I can completely
relate on a personal level
of being like I don't wanna do this shit
no more on my own like fuck it let's
let's do it
so yeah
this is definitely a yapping corporal on that
right and he gets started with the game
I have no idea how long this game takes
I am going to aim for like a two hour stream

Azura got four shorts

Home goes on the other side of steel
Yeah
Right, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay. We're getting there. We're getting there. We're getting there. We're getting there
Let's just move everything up a little bit. Okay, river
A little wider than a mile
I'm crossing you in style
some day
Oh
Wherever you go
What
Adventure awaits
Adventure waits is the first one on the left
Who picked this color scheme?
I don't see it
What like that?
What the fuck?
Is that what you want from me?
All the way left adventure waits
What's going on?
Like this
Oh
No
Shit one. No, no, no
Robert don't talk to me. That was absolutely awful. Right. Okay. Let's try again
Let's go again. I'm addicted to the serotonin
Right, what is this?
Oh
Okay
A little bit of honeycomb
A little bit of monocled
A little bit of it is all I need
What the fuck is this?
Oh no, hold on a minute
Vivi might have actually had some I don't know do hey do hey do hey do hey
Do hey do hey
Hey do hey
Or is this supposed to be a secret and it's not really that hate so it doesn't get to go there
Yeah
Okay, mm-hmm
Okay, mm-hmm. Yeah, okay. I'm starting to understand why people hate this game. Okay. What do you want from me?
Is this the content? What the fuck?
Who or what are you spitting at the puzzle?
What?
What do you want from me?
You want to kiss me?
Make it more
I don't I don't know you
I don't know you want you want to be honest
What do you want?
Just move it a little to the left. You know what?
You know what? You know what? You're the first to get our word in the train. Sorry. I really shouldn't make
And yet I do what happens. What happens? I don't know
What are you? What are you saying?
Right, hold on. Let's go
Let's do wit
Again, the milk is the wittiest boy
Right, you're skinny melinky long legs. So don't
Right, let's do witt
Um
I'm stumped. I don't know what it is. Uh, something about the colors
Okay, let's okay
Something about the colors
Colors, uh, love them. I'm not colorblind. Lucky me. Uh, yellow
Oh
Something about the colors
Um
Oh
What what are you asking for
I've no go clue colors
You know last time magic segregation was like way back in the fucking past. What the fuck are we doing sort by colors for?
What the fuck? I can't figure it out
Purple right, there's purple here a purple there. Then that's the balsamic fucking piece of shit
Right, so now what?
Align the labels
What they're supposed to fucking kiss
Where how is that supposed to
I
What what even is this laying the labels on my back
What it's all supposed to like touch or something
Olive oil next to the milk
So
Whatever vv said about this game she was right
What
I can see something forming here
I don't think we should all the luck
I don't even have a brain cell to talk and try and figure this out at the same time. Are we skipped you doodling?
I think you're overthinking it. Well, how do I open up the menu?
Tubbs and mayonnaise to milk to balsamic
There's a fucking line there's a hidden line
Right tub to mayonnaise to milk
Tub
To mayonnaise to milk something I already forgot
Ah
It's milk to balsamic to thingy to the medium the milk to the stomach
I still not afraid again
So
Space them
Oh
Yeah, that's getting a bit too much
That's getting a bit too much hold on a minute. VV was right. Hashtag VV was right. I'm not even being funny
Oh
Are you trying to soften me up after that one?
pooders
Any cheesers it's been funny, but I've got a shower. Oh, yeah, the puzzle really got you good
Oh, okay, right I can tell the story um
Okay, he has an idea. He wants to spill the drink. Okay. He drops the bath and the drink and plant
Wait, we're just taking photos of our cat destroying stuff. We're like we're just letting it happen. Um
Oh, no, it's going downhill. I thought I was doing so well, but my logic isn't
Uh
The reason the earth is not flat is this cat so didn't knock everything off switch the first
switch the first
second
And throw the round
You guys watch me do it the wrong way
I
Wait if I don't every combination but the correct one
You guys have to look at the drink first and then he gets an idea to knock things over
Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. He looks at the drink and then he gets a bright idea to knock shit over
And then he knocks stuff over
First he sees the glass and then the lamp
Okay, he sees it and then he gets a bright idea to start knocking stuff over
Okay, maybe another color puzzle
Nettie gray, how many chapters are there?
We're actually kind of get I mean we may actually do this. Hold on a minute. I have a little bit fee
I spoke far too soon and I'm sorry
Oh, I see something
Okay, I see something I see something I see something here
And this
There's five chapters I have a little bit of faith sees the next puzzle
Right these two fit
Okay, these three fit and the glove fits the fingerprints on that one. So
Okay, okay, okay
Okay, it doesn't work. Oh wait, those two work together
The bucket seems like it has to go there
Yeah
No, you can but you bump into him
All right, everything bumps into the bucket so the bucket has to go at the end
That is my only logical conclusion the bucket has to go there. Okay, right then we'll figure out what happens over here
Oh
Wait, what does it look right?
Everything looks correct other than this one go in the bucket go in the bucket
Go in the bucket
I'm cleaning them make them shine
This looks correct I gone crazy
This oh the sponge goes in the square space
Sponges, why are we no longer participating in the laws of physics all of a sudden
Why is physics just optional now in the game right? I'll need to keep that in mind
I
Physics is no optional got a G's right big batteries
I am speed
I am speed
I am speed
I am speed
You don't belong here
You might belong here though. Yeah, that looks correct correct in Mundo
Nope, you can't all fit in there you're too big
Okay, okay, okay
That looks
I mean them I'm gonna see
The yellow one on the place of the one
Thank you for rather violent
All you want to then
Okay, this one's cute I like it I like it I dig it I dig it angry sneeze
It was so loud my screen flickered. That's hilarious
What's wrong? Oh, that's right
That is different therefore it's wrong
Okay, there we go. Oh, it's a good one. Okay. I like that one. I like that one. Let him get up
Okay, the game might have redeemed itself slightly scream again, please. That was a sneeze
You've got coins. So this is a 50-pence coin
Okay
Go from a circle
Into a lesser circle over time
A circle how many sides one two three four five six
Seven eight nine ten one two three four. Oh you
Wait one two three four five six seven
One two three four five six one two three four five six nine
Ten
I'm sorry. I'm special needs. Hold on a minute. What I know what I'm trying to do but it's not coming out
So
Well, I just did more circling. Oh, they start
Why would you start
Why would you start
Why did you start
I
Mean
I'll take it. She's what that was an accidental discovery
Let's try that that was the
Maybe it's better to do the more obtuse items first
Is that even fit
That's what she said
Get it get it because
No, do the more obscure items you look obscure
Anything that looks mainly different than the usual getting out
What even is oh it's a tea infuser
You put your dry tea in it one chopstick
Sorry, there's a really good vein and the guy's like I'll have one
Of your ass or
No, no, no, no, no, you're not left to be
Being out here. What? Oh, it's one of those that makes sense
My god, I you knew it. Oh, you know it. You know it
Uh
Wait, is there only like one no, I can't hear it
Okay, the spoon has to be this one because of this little arch way thing going on I refuse to believe they didn't
We can oh wait, do the wee ones go together? Oh the wee spoons go there
Well, all done next round, uh, what
Anything like fine
No, this is correct
If I just shake it the game will surely accept it. Can you stack the red spoons again? They're stacked in a weird order
Sorry, sorry
Right just type in
Rebecca's
Take away, okay
And you'll understand you'll understand why I go out there
Because if you've got my accent, would you?
Wait until you open up
Today, we're going to pack this customer's order
They ordered a bit at Becca's munchie belongs. Sorry. The mixer doesn't fit
Uh-huh
Uh-huh
Well, that doesn't go anywhere else either
Oh, we're opposite Greek and we don't have a paddle. It's the tea infuser
Oh
That was very specific. Um, I mean
It's all right. I'll get I get it. I get it. I could have got the hint because the things
I'm to go off of pure babes alone
Oh
I mean if the game helps me and points them the right way then sure, but uh
No
No
No
What
Okay
Yes
No, yes
I want to put it up
I don't know what's gotten into me today
It's clearly not
Stop stop talking do you understand? Okay
Oh, okay
Okay
Okay
I think we're doing it
Oh
Okay, what is this though packing peanuts
Strawberries and a mid-today we first prepare for the most intense ink extraction
No, I'm too depressed to express for right now, but uh, oh this looks like a nightmare
After I have a few days to recover
Please don't be surprised if I start using my alternative to wear a heck of a lot more
Oh, wait, is this a hint that the candles go here?
No
I'm a bit nervous on this one after
Right remove everything
Let's just close the doors not our problem
It must I hope it was
Okay, we're a bit of a rough start bit of a rough
Okay, this can't go sideways so the only place it literally can fit
Had a lot
I'm not satisfied
Oh
This is a tricky one
Oh, it's obvious
Dave
Oh, I need like
Oh, this one's a scary one
Hey, okay, that I'm satisfied with I'm satisfied with that. Okay. Let's get that right. I've got a knife

I'm very unconfident
Sizzlers. Yep. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Let me get up
Ah
Usb it can go either way. It was oh no, can I go up and down?

All right, I'm gonna be honest with you
But there's only one two three four crayons
Is it possible that

Well, something please think of the candles the candles don't have a home if you steal them
I might have to go up here
Although they don't look very organized up here
And there's literally nowhere else for them to go so like
I don't have much faith in this one to be honest
Why are you going sideways?
I'm gonna put that one there for now, but I feel like that's a red herring, but it's okay. What do you?
I don't even want to know what that's useful
From tall it you have some more candles or more
But I don't what's
Maybe it is the section I mean
Maybe
They all look like the same height
Candles go top left

I'll shut your cock. Whoa. Hold on a minute. Oh
Okay, follow the arrows arrow goes along
Uh, don't do it to me like this are you serious?
No, not a certain puzzle. I can see the arrows is like go here then go there and then I need to put this one here
And then that one there. Oh my god, it's like an actual
I'll just never get at these
I
Can't do these kind of puzzles
No, hold on. We're gonna brute force this right. I need this one here next. Okay, that's fine. I can do that
What I need it like
Wait, I'm gonna do it
Whoa
Am I being trolled
I'm genuinely being trolled
Wait, but no, I can't put it anywhere

Bulls this one up
You absolute arseholes
You are schools, you knew they knew what they did
Arseholes
Right, where's the box I even need this one? I think what are right?
I need that purple one
Oh, yeah, you know that one you said you just needed
Uh, maybe use your brain for like five seconds. She relaxes
That's been sold me so badly right
I move this one away now
I'm not wrong. No, I can't have
Oh
Okay
Okay
Yeah, no wait, hold on purple purple to white
Uh-huh, okay, uh-huh
Let nope let me go let me go
Okay, then wait and balloons wait has to go here. Okay
Uh-huh, sorry the tape doesn't align
Well, it goes pink up here, but I need white to go there
No, it's too tall
This is absolutely awful
Like I know what it wants me to do but
I
Unless I can just a really quick hail Mary
Oh
Oh
Oh
Here
Oh
So I want it
And maybe
It might be it might be
Okay
Okay, am I doing it? I might be
Oh
Oh
No, I have to move it all over by one
Can I just control all the
I had to move it over by one
Hold on
Maybe it's not as bad right hold on. Let me get up
Let me get
Hmm I've already unlocked again purple purple into white
Oh, I'm gonna fart bro
Purple into white
Oh
Baby what I need that I need access to that one
Okay, okay, hold on hold on don't give up yet don't give up yet
Right, I need this later. Oh shit. No, right walk goes under
Oh
Um
I need that one to literally go along one
You're blocking it to go along one. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay
Oh
Don't
Okay
Yeah, no, they're literally like, yeah, we know you spent an ungodly amount of
I'm not even doing the second thing. What the heck that was
Awful, sorry. I had my mouth covered like I had my hand over my mouth. So I'm so sorry if my tracking was like dead
Oh, they've got wee bonies
Okay, let's get you nice and polished
That polish the pedals as well. Oh wait, I need to rotate it, don't I?
Oh
No, they get depressed when the catcher's open
It's a big dramatic for a game like this
Chapter four in our nature. We may actually do it
We may actually do it real
We may be two hours in but we may actually do it
There's only a little bit
Oh, I really fixed it everything the cats demolished. Oh, I like that
Oh, I like this
Oh
I get his near the kitty made my flipper look real true. Can't use the final ball
We clean up the cough. No, we don't see okay
Oh, we're cleaning up after the kitty. I'm not even mad. Let's pick up for the mug. Oh, no, let's fix the rug
Are you squiddin me right now? There's more Brian
The strontis trainer well done strontis such a good girl from clean the puzzle bot. No. No, I'm gonna sign this up
Oh, there's more
Must be under the newspaper
Oh, thank you for the tips strontis trainer really have to see it like that
Let's get rid of that. Let's get rid of the ball frame
Oh
The leaves are stopping me from cleaning the plop run
Oh, I love this level
I want to clean up after the poody as long as the poody cat has fun and enrichment
Oh, give me the rug back give it back
No, stop it. You're putting more dirt on the floor kitty
Kitty I'm trying to know how to get right
Oh, I missed I missed. Oh, that was lucky. You almost got that. Take that. I thought thank you. Ah, give it back. Give it back kitty
Ah
No, he keeps stealing it. I'm like literally doing it so fast. Sorry. Okay, there we go. We got it. We got it. We got it
My kitty stealing my ring
Wow, that was a cute one. I like this puzzle and like this chapter
Oh
Oh, we're preening so the reason
I fucking got tame challenge what the fuck
Oh, god, what the right? That's definitely not doing right. Hold on. Why am I not doing it right?
Mm-hmm
Oh
One
One
No, what?
Right. It can't be that
Rotate the fuck out of this plank. That's not the mission objective
Go for symmetry
So
Symmetry
I
Would not have gotten that ever
I would not have gone that ever if he didn't say that I would not have figured that out that was far too difficult
Oh, it's um, okay deep red
Changing hues thank goodness. I'm not colorblind, huh?
Yeah, okay. Okay. I saw it. I saw it. I've done something's off for the queue. Perfect. It's the
This is very bright on me eyeballs. Oh, they're kissing
Yes, I'm off the screen. Uh
Which one has the cat on it pick a jar any jar any jar at all
It's yours. I promise there's money and I'm not scamming pick a jar any jar refling any
Uh
Oh, I see it. I see it. I saw it see it see it sword
Yeah, I see with the leaves even here
The right jar
You see emmy's ginger when she's clearly blonde and what universe is she blonde?
I don't know if this is like a culture thing or something and what universe is any blonde genuinely
She's clearly a yin-yang
So I'm not really sure why it's even up for debacle
I was very surprised when she was like, I'm I'm ginger
Yes, emmy you literally have orange hair your ginger
She's definitely blonde. Oh wait, are you being serious or am I getting trolled?
Am I being trolled? I'm unironically doing a poll right now. I think this must be a culture clash
because
uh
What?
Oh, that's me. Hi. Um
Hold on start a poll
Oh, I just closed the tab. Well, nice try. Let's try that again. We should try another poll. Gee
Okay, add poll
What hair
Hair color do you think emmers is question mark?
She's
She's ginger
Orange and brackets for those of you who are dumb
Because you're a dumb dumb if you think she's literally blonde
she's
Blonde and brackets yellow
And what?
Right there we go start full
Okay, I'm literally doing a poll and chat right now
What hair color do you think emmy is she's ginger and brackets orange? She's blonde and brackets
Yellow in what world is she actually blonde? Please be so for real right now. Are you mental?
I think she's a ginger blonde. No, you cannot be ginger blonde. You're either a ginger or you're a blonde
She's blonde at the top and it transitions to gingerish near the bottom. I've shown you her concepts are she's a yin or
Literally pumpkin hair. She's pumpkin themed voodoo doll themed
She's a yin or
I hope the last option is now do a poll for as there is hair color. Oh, you guys are gonna be split on that one
See you elite. I don't 35% of you think she's blonde. I used to be honest. Are you strong? Do you actually think she's blonde?
Thank you for the tip tiny spainy. How is she blonde? She's orange. She's a pumpkin. Her hair is themed after pumpkins
orange
Oh
Right now to do the real one. Okay. The veal or hair colors are the real a little bit bro, right? Let's do a zero
Azura's
hair color is
Green
blue
Okay, there we go
All right, those never pull up for Azura's hair color
I
Your choice is is it green?
Are you
I'm not even teal. Are you squidding me right now?
I don't have a said blonde liar
absolutely
Azura is literally a blue green mix. It's called teal. That's what I said. She's teal
It's awkward marine, which is a shade of green. No, don't say such things. It's seafoam green, which is green
No, don't say such things
Do you have long and right? I'll tell you what we're gonna look at. Azura's a seafoam
Mostly blue with hints of green teal would be mostly green with hints of blue
Oh
Are you squidding me right now?
We're being debated unironically
Pull up the color chart. You know what maybe her
Her concept art was a bit more accurate. Thank you tiny spanish. Thank you. Okay. Don't are you squidding me right?
Maybe it's a strawberry blonde. What universe? Hold on. I'm actually right strawberry blonde
Let's look it up and ask
That's orange
That's all I will literally show you the first picture that shows up
I'm getting heated. I'm actually getting heated
That's
orange
And what universe?
Where the fuck is the picture show me
Okay
Okay, this is what comes up
This claw is what comes up when you take strawberry blonde
It's orange. I'm sorry. It's orange. It's ginger
Oh my god
I'm getting trolled so hard. This is ginger. I type in strawberry blonde. Please your blood pressure. That's ginger. Thank you
And now you're saying Azura's got green hair. I'm getting trolled so hard. Oh my god the first oh
It's ginger. She's she's a yinya
Okay, right. Let's unbreak
The book is a logic puzzle on this yin. Like that?
What do you mean she's no ginger? I need her
I birthed her from my lungs. I'm convinced Johnny. She emmys 100 ginger
She's 100 ginger from the start
Her concept art. She's a pumpkin. She's based after a pumpkin and a
voodoo stuff
I were tame as she's still going down straight. I'm still going
I'm mlg at this game
Are you squidding me right now? Ah anonymous you need to visit a doctor. We are very worried for your eyes
Are you I'm not colorblind. I will rob. I don't know. Um, it must be a culture clash thing. That's just straight up ginger
Like what do you think a ginger person looks like then and then don't say eric from freaking south part
What is this I have no idea what i'm doing right now. I'm so sorry
I
Don't even have a hint of like where I can put anything
Speaking of so far crap
I
Just make them pairs. I mean I can do that easily
We'll crab legs are together little horns are together
With an iron horn
What? Oh, what was that?
Are you giving me a hint to where the location
You see she'll mirror it. Yeah
Are you squiddling me right now?
Don't worry trust chak chak knows best and will always help and never lie to you believe us
Yeah
Thank you anonymous
I do trust and believe in you but something
I find it hard to believe that I
Oh
Did he kiss
Though those two kiss why aren't you
Kiss right now
Kissing they are kissing those kiss really low
Nothing can touch
I
Put them over here
Oh
Is it gonna float in that's loaded in
I
Want to try and find a slaw
I'm trying to find it
Verical mirror image
You're probably making symmetry. Yeah, but like nothing's like being like I yes, I register in the spot
Try to find this
Have you ever done an IQ that yeah, it's gonna be a don't it's our reward though
It's gonna be a very low result. That's all I can tell you
Oh
No, this oh
It's like half getting dragged half not right close your eyes. I'm sorry. I need to like I don't actually know where it wants
Fucking throw on the
Oh
No pumpkin space not no
No, no
Mommy's cooking right now this
Is that
Benny
Benny no
What what everything is doing a little down to down
No
Oh
The cat literally try to give me a hint
Oh
Hydration check replaying
How long will your donut on me?
Um, I'm doing a 48 hour one
Azura has to do a 12 hour one. Um just for living situation, but I think she'll be able to do that after it, which I'm very excited
Right, okay. Um
Actually, I need to write Azura's donut phone stuff out because she did it with a bleeding heart
So I need to come in and be like, okay now do this
48 hours, yes, uh
I think mercy will be moved out by the time her donut phone comes around
So she can do 48 hours as just as there is cases about you
No, I wanted to make a bulb
Is this symmetry again
I
Is oh my god, hold on. I need to like open my eyes really wait to do this
Hold on hold on. Sorry. I probably look really weird right now. I need I can't compare if my eyes aren't like wide open
Hold on
You
Uh-huh. Oh you
Do
Are you squidding me right now?
Oh, jackson's job. Hey stony. Thanks for feeling her. Oh, my nice of you. You're welcome. I'm glad you can enjoy the girls
It's only broken on stream. She's still reading
I'm like the chat disconnect. I hope no
Okay, right hold on. I need to do it again
I can't I don't want to say I can't see it yet, but I can't see it yet
Is it obvious and maybe
Oh you you're different
Okay, we did it. We did it. We did it. We did it. I got it. I got it. I did it
That was a little harder than I thought. I had to like
I don't know if you can see how well my eyes track. Uh, but that was like I had to go for it
Okay rocks
Man women love rocks
Gugli eyes
Gugli gugli eyes sweeties
Oh
Oh, I like this one
I like it very much. It's that's a good one. Very nice. Good one. Good one. I like that one
Oh, these are lotus seeds
Oh, they're all seeds. Oh, I love this one. Oh, those are the windfall seeds
What are you
I make them kiss
Oh, no, is it symmetry again? Be honest. I think it may be
Oh, it's symmetry again. All right
All right. All right. All right. I know she's about to ask this is her seed spread
Mommy puzzle moment puzzle. She disconnected from it. Is chat disconnected?
Will you and the girls ever use scripts posted to read it? No, we need the legal copyright
Of it. So we can't use that kind of stuff unless like someone came to us and we're like, hey
I give you all rights to this
Oh
But no, we cannot do that for copyright reasons
Wow, I love this one. It's so pretty just like you're reefing pretty little puzzles
What are you? I don't even know what seed you are. That's fantastic
I
Poppy this is a poppy seed. This is where you get opium from
Yes, I'm telling the truth
if you didn't know
Okay, and where when our derivatives of a plant
Um for the poppies you have to slash them before they bloom and then they'll secrete the opium
It's rather fascinating. Honestly, that's why like
Meth is because it's like lab made it's so dangerous and much more addicting because like literally it was produced to be that way
So very scary stuff. That's why you should never smoke crack
Because it's man made and the effects are insane
Whereas at least if you did her um cooking or heroin, you know, it's from a plant. So
It's a little bit better
Because it's not as bad, but it's not necessarily that good as well. So don't get
Is
Well, these three are the same color and have stripes these
Oh, but that one's the same
You're the only thing we need. Ah, are you so sweet people?
Well, you ever have male members in veal or sadly not no, um
The reason veal work is
You know can work is because the team is female content careers behind the scene
um
And unfortunately like I can't advise on male creation because I
What the heck am I supposed to do
This one's a curious pale
Hmm
Maybe if it's got like black
Like
That's got pink pink pink
Green
Why am I trying to achieve I'm not really sure I'm trying though
Oh, this one's tricky
Competing as a meal. Give me that strontium baby
Solids in the corner
Oh
That's so good. Good catch reflin. That's such a good one. Oh, I like that one
I would never have thought of that. That was a good one
Mild case of severe strontia addiction
Stainless reflin
Oh dear, right. We need a corner piece if there is any
Dear
I really feel like there's much corner pieces at all. Well, maybe you
Think
Hmm
Oh wow, I'm struggling with this one, wait let me kick a little bit though.
I don't have any corner pieces, how can I be, oh, is it color-
I can't be color-coordinator, so I'm gonna puzzle together.
How can a puzzle be a puzzle if it isn't puzzle-together?
It's a myth.
No.
Let me try to quickly find the solution, I'm sorry!
That was like a corner piece.
Maybe?
Pink when you have in top right should be bottom right.
I knew that.
You're on about honestly, I'm so obviously-
I don't know, do you get embarrassed being wrong all the time, refund?
Let's try to do that.
Oh that looks right.
Oh yeah, ooh up a bit.
Well that looks correct.
Look they're kissing!
Hmm, doesn't seem too right on this bit, I'm not convinced.
Need to kiss another day because I don't think-
Okay that looks more like a okay, how?
Okay you, you kiss right now.
Okay, okay.
Uh-huh, uh-huh.
This is not look right to me at all, what the fuck, I see so hard.
Kicking? I don't know, am I kicking? I don't know what is the little green one
in between.
Very true, very true.
But I cannot do shapes at all.
Well no, these- right, so don't get rid of it just yet, but-
Bro, I can't do isometric shapes!
Oh, what? Nothing fits!
I don't look right.
Like that, no.
Right, okay, hold on.
It's just- okay, okay, okay.
Okay, okay, okay.
I'm here for uh-huh, maybe, possibly, possibly.
Uh-huh, uh-huh. Okay, okay, don't, don't, don't let up now.
Don't let up now, oh, oh, oh!
We did it! That was so good! It all came together!
Yeah, you can do it, replaying, see? That's proof why you gotta keep
persevering. It doesn't matter if you keep jamming it in over and over, you'll
eventually get the result you want.
Stronikals 2024, thank you.
Okay, let's see what we're dealing with here.
Hydration check! What do you mean by that? Hydration, hydration, hydration!
Are your, are your strontium copium levels going up?
Know that I can do longer streams again?
Oh, is this symmetry be honest?
Oh, actually, I just clicked off him. It is symmetry, right, okay.
Oh, are we free of restrictions? I thought we had a little more time.
Um, I'm still feeling depresi-wessy because my dad's gone.
Um, but I am going to focus on the work that I missed because there's a
lot of v-tubers that are waiting for me to edit the collabs that
they were very keen to agree to me with. So I've got a bit of a work ahead but
don't be surprised when there's a bit of an explosion of ASMR videos on my
YouTube channel or on Patreon as well.
Um.
It's symmetry. Kitty! No, you're doing it.
Symmetry's in a lot of pockets. Yeah, this seems to be the reason.
I hope you feel better soon. Yeah, it's trying to explode on Patreon, yeah.
No worries, take your time, yeah. Um, it's why I picked three shorter games, just...
Eh.
Oh wait.
Is that what I'm supposed to find?
I think so, I think I just suck on putting it in, please.
Oh, you zoom out.
Oh, there's snowflakes.
That's not right then.
Did you know something, something snowflakes aren't all equally created or
something? Ah, I found it.
Uh, well your gemmets put ASMR in their Patreon channels as well.
Yes, they already have audios of the variety up.
More?
Oh, more.
Okay, and then we just need the ends.
They're like little banisters. Okay, this one is a cute one, I like that one.
That one's a good one, good one.
Are you gonna make more hypno stuff? Uh, not on Patreon because it's a ban.
I'm not allowed to put it on Patreon, unfortunately.
Okay, the section, okay. And this one, that's such a good one.
I'm here for it, it's a sad one.
Mmm, but I'll put it up on Twitter, I have a four part series on Twitter.
Once I edit it, I need to edit it first. I've got a lot of editing I need to do
actually over the next few days, but I'll get there.
Um, you just need to let me... Oh, this is such a good one.
I approve very much of this one.
Oh, bing.
Bing, bing. Yeah, that's what I thought.
You better be bing bonging me.
Oh, no. Can we release the slides?
Oh, no.
Oh, what's that? One, two, three. One, two, three.
One, two, three, four. One, two, three, four.
Um, Outside one, uh, Opposite again.
Oh, there's our spoiler. We fed the spoilers.
So proud of you working hard for this one. Yeah, I'm glad.
You guys enjoy. Near Earth organizer, what a strange name for a
chapter.
What's this about Hypno? I like Hypno content, but it's banned
on Patreon, so I have to do it on Twitter.
Huh?
Huh?
What, is it not to go there?
What's that? Huh?
Oh my god, we have to tame it.
It becomes a donut. It goes in the hole. It comes on up.
Oh, I'm not going to like this one.
Okay, go here.
Oh, it's because we're in a coffee shop.
It's making coffee sound. Oh my god, that's such a strange one.
Okay, right. Then we're going to bring it back.
We're going to catch it. Then we've got the apple.
And we're going to put the apple in the golf.
Okay, and then we're going to put it in the cup of tea.
Right.
Bitch!
Right, apple into the golf.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. You just, you just hold your horses, sir.
We're going to beat the golf into the constellation which drops into a tea or something. I don't know.
Oh, do I need to pot it? Maybe I need to pot it.
Okay, become a donut. Pull back.
And then loads of gravel here.
No. No, what?
Right.
Oh, no.
Okay, okay, okay, got worms. So what happens if I make it go right, sir? Does anything happen?
No, it's wrong. Okay, that's fine. Now I know it's wrong.
Oh, I've just put that in.
Right, become a donut. Unbecome a donut.
Okay, now we've got an apple. Now go to the golf man.
Beautiful, stunning, gorgeous. Now we are going to turn these right side
for some ungodly known reason.
I don't know why, but we are.
Right, well.
Oh, God, this is awful.
What? Am I not to put it in the hole? Be honest.
Oh, you need to overshoot the hole?
Who's supposed to figure that out in their day off?
Honestly. Right, go in the hole.
Go and become a golf ball. And then
and then just fucking send it.
I did that anyway. You're such a stinky game.
Patreon isn't stingy on it.
It's actually our Mastercard Overlord.
That is the reason why you can't do a lot of stuff.
So always thank you.
I'm sorry, was that yes to then posting?
I do it. I don't really ask the girls to do it just because it's a lot of
extra effort, but I could do it.
What?
What?
Uh, I...
If you late, save for work, I can maybe get
Amy to do that.
You spin me.
That wanted to stroke midnight or something?
Wait, really? What's wrong with the two?
Oh, they dictate the whole world.
Mastercard dictate everything.
They are literally our overlords. Like, I'm not even kidding.
That's not me, like, tinfoil hatin'. They literally call the shots on the internet.
That's why Patreon ban, like, step...
Mm-hmm.
And, like, hypnosis, because they said it's, like,
there's no consent with it when literally that's
actually the entire thing about hypnosis.
Yeah, so you have to...
What am I doing here? I don't know.
Is it in the shadow of that line or something?
Mm-hmm.
Oh, I was typing it over, so I can mention
the PMIC process. They control the money.
Yep, server controls the Mastercard, controls the universe.
What am I trying to achieve?
I don't know.
Um...
What is this?
Mommy, I have to ask, but why is the thumbnail...it's glitched. The thumbnail's correct for me on my
end. I'm not sure why.
Does it...replay? Hold...right, close your eyes.
A singular pale?
A singular pale was my frickin' hint.
Don't look.
It's not a wild dog.
Oh, well, excuse me.
Hmm.
I'll try the quick question. How likely will this be?
Oh, no.
Huh? Are the shadows wrong? Are these shadows telling
you what goes in front of them?
What?
What?
The horse just doesn't care.
He's just off on me.
Maybe who comes after?
Okay.
That doesn't make sense, though.
Symmetry with a horse in the middle?
No, those six people.
Maybe Merritt, hate on the shadows?
That's a good suggestion.
Unfortunately, that's not our solution.
What? Size order?
I don't know.
Staircase thing?
Oh, I just realized I'm covering up half of the puzzle.
Does that not bother anyone?
I'll just be a big-headed ass down here about that.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Keep playing.
You can move the shadows.
No way would they do a silly thing like that.
The game got real hard to look at every puzzle.
I think you're original in the right track.
Oh, it's a constellation.
What's that?
I'm too low IQ to discover such.
What's that? I'm too low IQ to discover such.
What's that?
What's that thing?
I don't know, but it's a map.
It's not even the map.
What's that?
I don't know.
I don't think so.
that was me me that's all I'm saying that was not me
was all the game because what I'm not I mean it's just discovering it itself
really who's that Pokemon I didn't see the chat I it's just kind of doing it on
its own I mean I'm not complaining I'll take an easy one kind of sliding in a
place of it honestly this game I didn't think I was gonna like it as much but
this is definitely like a solo experience you just want to chill out and

anyone didn't my candle stick is bigger than oh you you you
oh what
What?
Burning thing.
That's a friend turned spell at me.
I need to...
Aww.
I need to turn this around.
So peculiar, truly.
Yay.
They're getting bigger.
Refling, stop getting your tentacles with it.
No, it's not the tent.
You're trying to put it with your tent.
Burn them all again.
Don't ever touch an open flame in your home, if I will.
Don't ever touch an open flame in your home, if I will.
They're straight to me.
I've got a bit more on you.
Oh, you were right, Refling.
Thank you.
What was the other variation?
There seems to be another variation, is that one?
There's another one.
Right.
Oh, we've got a glace ball.
There's another one.
It looks nice and neat and tidy.
Let me clean your room again, Refling.
Your punishment for making me do manual labor.
Manual labor.
I'm making lemonade.
Oh, sweet skull.
I don't seem to pick up that one.
There's one of them.
Oh, I like this.
Oh, I do.
I see you, little fella.
I see you.
Can you open up?
Can you open up?
You better unlock right now.
Oh, we're going to have problems.
We're going to have fisty cuffs.
Please open.
Oh, the hoops.
Oh, how creative.
Nothing.
Oh, the bits look correct.
Let's go back to the manual.
It's all good to me.
It's really exciting, right?
Misalignment.
Misalignment on pixel 234.
Please correct or you will not proceed.
I repeat, you will not proceed.
Let's go back up here.
Yeah, now the bits are stuck.
Hmm.
I don't need to put it on.
I can fucking chop that fast.
What is this thing?
You did that.
Yeah, it seems to be a misalignment on something.
Hmm.
Can you?
Who or what is misaligned?
Misaligned.
I think we may have to skip this one
to stack the book specifically over the wall.
The books are all in a line here.
It like bounces it off because it wants to show you the reflection of the stuff.
Does that make sense?
It wants to show you the reflection
so it's trying to bounce it.
Who goes there?
Hmm.
That's a shame.
Sorry, I'm satisfied that we did that.
I don't know how to chop this lemon
but it seems like a half or another thing.
We may skip it, you do that.
I think we did it.
Yeah, I think we did it.
Maybe the mirror is supposed to go all the way there.
I'm clicking that shit as hard as I can.
I think you need to get the mirror on right away.
Can you do like a little drive by just so the game moves?
It looks right to me.
Oh.
Open it, put it right.
And then put it to the right
for the books and that'll show.
I think it's being a bit silly.
I think it's being a silly Billy.
Hmm.
Hmm.
Okay, I think we'll go next.
Is it let it be mean skip?
Why would they go let it be?
Skip a level?
Yeah, it's because you guys are pissed.
You didn't code it right.
I got an achievement for skipping that level.
Okay, we have...
Oh, these are those chirpy birds.
I see all the buttons on.
I love it already.
I love not having to think for myself.
So...
Surely there's nothing better.
Um, to make a love fire?
Okay, off.
Uh-uh.
Off, off.
You're out of alignment.
You're out of alignment.
You two are out of alignment.
Hey, that's a good one.
That is a really good one.
I like that one.
High IQ, highest IQ.
And velar.
Not really.
I screen shot the crate image in Marshmallow.
Okay.
What are we doing? I'm doing a little...
guess the difference.
Hi, pretty kitty.
I don't know why, but cats really like when they're...
I got pet them in rhythm of the...
You mean your tail pet?
That's not really, like, feels too much.
You mean your chest pet?
You mean your ears?
Okay.
You mean your feetsies pet?
Is that all the space?
Okay.
Oh, sorry. You mean your chin pet?
You're a temperamental little fuck, you know that?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I just keep head pounding?
Oh.
I was literally...
over-complicating that.
That was not too early.
Okay, the speed is changing, which is why my brain...
Yeah, the speed is changing.
You fuck.
Yeah.
They're changing the speed right at the end.
They're changing the speed right at the end.
So my eyes are like, okay, if I...
maintain that speed, that's what it...
Yeah, fuck off.
We did it?
Mr. Mittens is happy?
He's gonna claw you?
Oh, you're so happy.
I love happy eating.
Wow.
Is this it, J.G.?
We did it!
Oh, he's actually peeing.
Oh, we got, like, a little animation.
A little animation?
You're feeling very sleepy, Rachel.
Oh, they're, like, synchronized swimmers!
I can't interact with...
nice detail, I see it.
Oh, no.
I'm not just enjoying the credits,
or am I actually to do something here?
I don't know if this is the credit.
I'm supposed to do something.
I can't click on anything.
Oh, I can.
Can I shake his butt?
I can click on me.
Everyone, let me...
I'm trying to, like, drag them.
They're the only things I can grab.
Oh, right.
Okay, okay, okay, D.
Why did you stop? I drink...
I take a swig of cola and you all stop?
Right, keep doing... yeah, keep...
Why are you retained so slowly now?
You're keeping me up.
Who's out of alignment? Identify yourself.
I can't touch anyone.
Huh?
No one's letting me touch them.
Don't you shake your little butts at me.
Nothing is letting me interact with it.
Two of them, please.
I can't grab any of them, though.
I don't know if you can hear me
spam-clicking in the background.
Emmy's rat army merch win.
No one's letting me touch them
literally at the convention
when you guys realize I'm the sexist.
I saw an image, actually.
I was going to tweet it out
and it was a picture of a woman
putting her hands in
a guy's pants and I was going to tweet out
like me at the convention for real.
When I see you for real, for real,
but I was like, oh god, that's not going to get me in trouble.
I am clicking
everything that will let me touch it.
I kid you not, I am going absolutely not.
I think I might have glitched it.
I don't know if I should rethought
something. I don't think it calibrated
right in this instance
because I'm
absolutely clicking it otherwise
and there's nothing hiding behind my head.
If you did that, you'd be good.
Who's going to get in trouble? Management?
What's that? No HR.
Right, I'm going to reset
because I'm not sure
that's working.
Oh no, don't make me pass it again.

Sleep.
What is that thing? Don't ask for permission.
Ask for forgiveness. Real.
Real.
I maybe get six in a row.
Right, what did I do? I spun him over
for a little bit.
We did the one thing.
Okay.
Can you go start shaking your booty?
Oh, yeah, I bogged out.
What happens if they all kiss
and love each other?
No, they're kissing.
Oh,
I understand.
Sorry.
Oh my god, it's fun to
with this.
You will understand that reference
soon.
Okay.
Is this like a mini version
of all the puzzles I just
said?
I think it is.
Nuts and bolts and bolts and
nuts.
Nuts and nuts and bolts and bolts
and nuts.
You, you're upside down.
You're upside down too.
Oh, my brain can't.
What?
I was driving.
Oh,
actually.
Oh, who's not moving
in the rhythm?
A bug.
Oh, a little lady bird.
Well, multiple lady birds.
I'll know this fish again.
No, I'm not having it.
Yeah.
There we go.
A lady bird, yeah.
No, boo.
A lady bird.
You're pretty-ish?
Yeah, they're called lady birds.
Oh, my god, we're getting taken away the night.
What is it? What are we getting?
Oh, I like this one.
Oh, sorry.
Oh, give me more.
Whatever that was.
I'll take 19 more.
No questions asked.
I'll take it back.
Okay, there we go.
What?
Oh, my god.
Oh, my god, please.
More.
A lady bird.
A lady bird.
A lady bird.
A lady bird.
Good.
No.
A bird.
Okay.
Okay.
Oh, it's a sandwich. It's a lunchbox.
Get rid of the crumbs. Go away.
Oh, the crumbs stay.
Oh, the crumbs stay!
Put them...
Oh, the crumbs would go with the bread.
Maybe that makes more sense.
Reflings, look away at one.
Why is that wrong?
Oh, fuck off.
You didn't see that.
You didn't see it, Reflings. You didn't see it.
Is that crongo? Give me that crongo.
The bread.
The asparagus layman?
Misalignment and asparagus number three.
You cannot proceed. Do not collect your...
Oops, sorry.
Don't look!
A carrot? What?!
I'll get a grip.
What? How?
What's that?
What do you want?
What do you want from me?
Who are you? Who are they?
Okay, this is getting a bit ridiculous.
Sorry. Right, cherry, lemon, tomato and asparagus on the bottom.
Wait, what?
Everything I've done is, like, horrifically wrong.
I'm not being trolled. Wait, I'm being trolled.
The carrot refuses to go up and down.
They're refusing to go up and down.
Oh, god.
Mm-hmm.
Right.
Okay.
We did it.
Sorry, I understood what you meant. I'm jolly.
Thank you for your infinite patience for me, however.
I love strongy style.
Okay.
Is that supposed to mess that up at the end there?
Wait, the ending doesn't let you do it properly?
Oh, putters! Hi, putters!
Hi, yeah.
Bleep, bleep, bleep!
Lost the lid to the upper room.
Oh, we need to help you claim, darling. How do I do that?
Okay, give me that one.
No, get rid of that. Give me that one.
Okay. New level.
Oh.
Okay, please stop.
Mm-hmm.
Uh-huh, mm-hmm, mm-hmm. Okay, mm-hmm.
Yes, yes.
I'm slaying.
I'm slaying, truly.
Truly in wholeheart, like, slaying.
I need another toe one!
Okay, he needs just the wee one now.
There you go. Wee!
Are you doing it, buddy?
You're going for the moon.
I don't even know that one.
Let's do a toe.
Yep. Nope.
Yep.
Mm-hmm.
Wee-yep.
Then a little one.
Then a little small one.
Then an even skinnier, malincier one.
Yeah, I'm windy.
I'm windy, okay.
I don't know why it's jiggling.
What, can I only do wee one?
Oh, I can't remove it.
Don't let me add it.
Don't let me add it.
I need to, like, fucking label block one.
The game's actually making sweat work!
Let's go high.
It won't let me remove, so...
Give me a wee skinny one!
It doesn't like that one a lot.
But it doesn't want me to remove it.
I don't want to remove it.
I don't want to remove it.
I don't want to remove it.
That one a lot.
But it doesn't like anything else either.
It only is the second wee one.
That was rather bizarre.
Hydration check.
Evil hydrate.
Honestly, I'd rather...
I'd rather...
Because it's not being mean.
Like, it's not like it's not cycling through it.
No, don't start wobbling again.
You're so dramatic.
I'm losing a little bit.
Just a little bit.
I need a wee one.
A wee short one.
There's a wee short one.
Aye, two wee short ones, I'll do that.
And then, like, the...
These wee medium ones.
Nope.
Yep.
Yep.
Nope.
Yep.
Yep.
No, then it'll lean into a piece of me.
That's correct.
I'm not sure what the requirements are.
Is it, like, the colour scheme thing?
Is it too high?
It has the colour match?
Don't see such things.
What is that?
Oh, it does have the colour match!
Why would you do such a thing?
Am I supposed to just wait for yellow only then?
Oh, my God, you're so right, is...
And then I need a skinny red one.
No, like a wee one.
Yeah!
Oh, close enough.
Kind of.
Right, I need a wee wee wee.
A wee wee red one.
To say red in French, you say...
You say pink in French, you say...
What colour is this thing called?
I can't believe I didn't figure that out.
So you're telling me I was just getting lucky this entire time?
I believe it.
I just need a long one.
I need a long one and then I can put a wee one on it.
Long!
Or two mediums.
I'll take it.
Beak.
Beak.
Play, dee-play.
What do we do?
Grey?
You've given me grey, so why not?
I don't know, it's too big.
Complete the timer by using every available spot.
Done?
Where there's the cat under the tree.
Under the moon and he's fleeing with it like it's yarn.
Then the cat is over the moon
and he's purring in the moon.
Thank you for listening to my song about the cat.
Now knock it over.
Honestly, cat behaviour.
What an interesting game.
Cat is ascending in the air.
Wah, a cozy completion.
Complete the campaign mode.
That was actually so surprisingly nice.
Oh well, I get to be the cat now.
Oh my god, Anne McMillan.
How could we have done that without you?
Lucas, don't forget we didn't have you near about you as well.
We're messing it all up.
What, I honestly thought...
I'm gonna say something really mean.
I thought that was gonna be rubbish.
But it was, Ney.
It was actually really good.
So is VV right or wrong?
Controversial take?
Is that Australian VTuber was wrong?
I thought that was gonna be rubbish.
But I really enjoyed that.
I don't know, what do you think?
Have you played it?
And if you haven't played it, did you...
Did I make you want to give it a shot?
It's like one of those games where you can tune out to this.
Other than the fridge one.
Sorry, I'm writing a review on the fridge one.
I don't care.
That fridge one makes no sense.
They need to make it more obvious.
I said what I said.
VV, actually VV was wrong.
Congrats.
We're gonna have to tune back.
No.
Might not stand up to many people.
No, you can replay it.
No.
A good start to a game.
Definitely.
I think that's definitely for more casual VTubers
that don't necessarily need something hyper intense.
They just want to have a nice chat and enjoy the experience.
I'd say that was pretty dang bandabi-dosey, honestly.
Never forget to paint the tools.
Now, I will say, I suspect VV never actually checked the hints.
VV and strongy drama confront?
No.
I'm gonna guess she purposely did it where she didn't look at the hints.
Because I looked at the hints, obviously I was like, well, I know what to do.
It was actually mostly fun because you played it.
Love the kit.
I was just so worried when I'm like, oh no, it may be a boring game.
These things might not find me.
VV actively avoided the hints function because she's a completionist.
Ah yes, okay.
I suspected that because with the hints then you can make it work.
You could do it in the future to get the solutions you want.
Do you want to play more puzzle games?
You could try the Talos principle.
I found it tough.
Oh, I'm very dumb.
It's super fun.
The alternative solutions on some of these are wild.
The game works pretty well if you can borrow brain cells.
Literally, thank you for carrying me.
Thank you so much for stream sniping.
Oh no, it's not called stream sniping.
It's called backseat gaming.
I love backseat gaming.
Ah, please do it more to me.
Sorry, I'm stretching when I did that.
So I got really late there.
Sorry if I scared anyone.
I did a stretch.
I switched.
I did big switch.
Oh, nowhere.
Are these all the creator's pets?
I'm going to agree.
That's so wholesome.
I love it.
I love it.
Honestly, I'm going to say something controversial.
10 out of 10.
10 out of 10.
Sorry, it was.
That was such a good experience.
You've got a cute little lane where the cat is winding you up through the whole thing.
Controversial, but 10 out of 10.
Literally, I didn't expect that.
Have you ever played Catherine?
No, but I'm aware of it.
And I know it's a puzzle game and there's no chance I'm going to win without dying.
So I would get too frustrated and start screaming at the game and then close it.
I think you're guessing a bit too much.
You didn't like that.
Maybe you guys made it really enjoyable for me, but I found that rather pleasant gaming experience.
Now, there's not many games that you can describe as pleasant.
And this, I would say, was such a pleasant environment.
The music, the little plot of her little pudders, annoying as, you know, I thoroughly enjoyed that.
Maybe you made it more enjoyable than I originally would rate it if I was just on my own some lonesome, but that was, I enjoyed that.
I don't think it was bad, but it's not 10 out of 10.
When you think of a game, you have to remove what you want to see in a game.
Because I would ask you, if you don't rate it at 10 out of 10, what would you do to improve it?
And you have to be careful with that question, because if what you're going to do to improve it would completely change up what the core purpose of the game is,
which is kind of relaxing, kind of puzzler environment.
And it's not really environment, because you're not really 3D, are you?
Like, did the development team achieve what they wanted to achieve with this game?
I would say, yes, they hit the nail on the head, it's a 10 out of 10.
You're relaxed, you're playing puzzles.
Yeah, it gets a bit frustrating, but they've literally got the hints ready right for you to be like, hey, we've got this.
Now, yeah, we ran into like, I think, what, two unpolished bugs?
Rather than that.
Who's this?
It was pleasant to what you played.
Johnny, it's a 10 out of 10.
Yeah, also me with Edith Finch.
Yeah, 8 out of 10, yeah.
Yeah, that's terrible.
I have a rubbish rating system, okay?
Well, you did already criticise the fridge puzzle.
Yes, now, whether or not that's a...
I'm going to, like, if I look it up and everyone agrees that the fridge puzzle needs a bit of alteration, then sure.
It depends how you rate games.
Well, you can't go, you can't rate a game objectively.
Right, this sounds really sad, but I want to rate video games in the future, and like, I did my research...
I did my research, I'll shut the fuck up, Johnny.
I researched it into it, and like, you have to remove your bias, because if you were to compare this game to Call of Duty,
yeah, of course it's a resident sleeper game.
You have to judge the game based on what the game is giving you.
You have to remove your bias as well, because my preference is, like, you know, something exciting,
but I don't want to get stalled in the progress type thing.
But I need to read... I need to remove my bias in a game type. Does that make sense?
Makes sense?
We need an expert game journal.
I'm going to attempt to do a review on Assassin's Creed Brotherhood,
and then a review on Isaac as my Donathon Rewards.
Now, in before, they're just absolutely catastrophic failures, but I want to give it a chance.
You need to compare it to other puzzlers in the genre.
Stick to the genre. You need to kind of, like, be able to identify what the dev team we're going for,
did they achieve it, you know, all these kind of things.
Finally, yapping is back. Stop!
Catastrophic. I've always wanted to be a game critic, but that's how I review games.
Yes. Attempting to have an objective eye is a good instinct, but impossible.
Hold those both in your head and you'll be fine.
Yes, so like, obviously, I'll be biased.
I'll be like, Assassin's Creed Brotherhood, 10 out of 10, best game of all time.
I've missed out if you have not played it. The graphic, you know, does the game live up to a dated, you know, time period and all that?
Actually, yes. But then again, I have a personal bias, and when I review the game, I'll say that I have an insane personal bias
because it also has a nostalgic factor for me.
Nostalgia is a billion dollar industry.
Billion dollar for nostalgia, okay?
The emotional nostalgia cannot be artificially recreated.
You must have experienced it at a younger age to create the pathways in your brain of familiarity.
You didn't know your brain adores familiarity.
It is not like going out of its way to learn new things because that takes effort, that takes brain power, that takes, you know, motivation to learn, take things.
That is why nostalgia is an insane drug that cannot be created in a lab.
I could go on a big massive rant about how powerful the nostalgia is.
You know, for example, you see this meme in passing.
When you get, like, a whiff of your childhood and, like, you walk past somewhere and you can, like, smell your childhood and you get, like, flashed back
and you never get the flash again because you don't know what the smell was type thing, okay?
You know what I mean?
Honest life, yeah.
But that's my teaching about it.
Nostalgia in the next teaching stream?
Uh, yeah, I wouldn't mind doing that at all.
I think I may stop the teaching stream just a little bit though.
Just a little bit.
But that's okay.
You usually want to stream or play this.
I check it out to see their experience with it, but they eventually have it in the background.
One of the camera streams for this.
I'd be more interested and curious.
I was only camp because I knew you guys would carry me through the game.
You guys would tell me smell and memory near the place of the rain.
Are you listening to an old song?
The teaching was fun.
Literally first day that's joining in goes for four hours.
Star has already been four hours.
I won't, no, I'll ramble for a bit, but I can't.
Is Emmy coming on?
We can maybe redirect into Emmy.
When does Emmy come on?
Sorry, the background music's gonna dissipate.
Oh, Emmy, are you coming on to this, darling?
Are you coming?
Are you coming?
Sorry.
Shut the fuck up.
I'm so excited.
Sorry.
I'm so excited to just be back doing long streams again.
I'm sorry.
That was wildly inappropriate.
Oh, stop.
I'm getting excited.
I've literally just played a puzzle game and I'm like, oh, not today.
Okay, I'm on my own some lonesome today.
Well, we can just be in San Juman.
I'm so so so.
Stonny's energy is coming back.
That's it.
Any more energy?
Oh, my YouTube short about how much does a small agency make?
It got one out of ten.
Oh my God.
And you guys are liking it.
Hold on.
Oh, I'm accidentally recording my screen eat.
I hate when my PC does that.
I try.
I do a screenshot and then it's like screen recording everything.
And I'm like, bro, can you not?
Hold on.
See this PC?
I'm actually gonna fart in its mouth.
This is such a rubbish PC.
Oh, that's a bit big.
You know what else is big?
Mal willy.
Sorry.
I'm so excited to be able to do longer streams again.
And I know I've got shorter streams for tomorrow and the other day.
Mercy's streaming at 10 a.m. my time or your time?
Because it's 7 a.m. right now.
I'm not sure I can yet.
Can I really yet?
Can I yet for two more hours?
Sadly no little sister there.
The shortest of one out of ten.
Right.
Okay.
So as you see on the screen, ranking by views, it says one out of ten.
That means in my last ten uploads of whatever content, this has ranked the highest in like
most generated views in the time span.
Okay.
So it's a one out of ten.
This is a really big thing.
Okay.
It means, hey, hold on a minute.
This is doing really well in comparison to previous uploads type thing.
So and then it says, so you see how that green dot is that green arrow on views is up.
That means again, I've gained more views.
Ten noon.
Noon.
I can't ramble for three hours.
I need to save my voice because I'm recording pregnancy.
It's so hard tonight and all my collabs are missed out on.
So I can.
But yeah.
Well, number go up.
I don't know about the Willy but the cake is massive.
Okay.
But yeah, it did well.
Thank you for everyone who interacted with that short.
I'm just checking the comments and someone's like, how much does your agency take?
How much does the agency take from me?
And even if I was a talent, it's 80, 20 and next year goes to 85, 15.
So the company see this.
The company see this.
It's so hyper.
Sorry.
I'm sure you're sick of me.
I'll put my background music on.
But yeah.
Thank you everyone who interacted with that short.
You're super kill and awesome.
And thank you for looking into my finances for me.
Thank you for looking into the gen two finances.
What?
Who said that?
What?
No, but really 12 cases massive for the first month for a beginning agency.
Yeah.
I am very lucky.
Just like how everything worked out.
Like obviously when I was brewing the girls in my womb, I was like, oh my God.
Am I making a mistake?
Like is this insane?
No motherfucker.
This ain't insane.
This is my calling motherfucker.
I have daughters.
I get to support and they get to achieve their dreams of being content creators.
This is my calling in life.
Just give me what should we do karaoke?
I'm being so for real right now.
Should we do pop up karaoke?
Hold on.
Hold on.
We could essentially do pop up karaoke for like two hours.
And then we can redirect into mercy.
I think we could.
I think we could.
Oh.
Oh no.
I have to save my voice.
No.
I forgot.
I need to do ASMR.
No.
I need to record ASMR.
Okay.
Wait.
Wait.
We'll do another pop up in another day.
I need to do ASMR.
I forgot.
I have so many people waiting for me to record ASMR to upload my collapse.
I'm so sorry.
I can't sing.
I'm so sorry to get excited.
Get you excited.
I'm done.
Please forgive me.
Right.
Let me open up my marshmallow.
Don't you have that kind of stream layer in the week?
Yeah.
But I like doing lots of streams.
I'm never offline.
That's right.
That's why I make the big bucks.
Because I'm never offline.
Wow.
If you want to save money for the girls, you could link your accounts together with the
Steam Family feature.
Yes.
The girls have full permission to do that with their previous accounts.
And they get to keep their Steam accounts at the end of their...
I don't know when they want to depart.
I don't keep it.
That's their money.
I absolutely do not touch any of that because they spent their money on it.
So they own it.
Crazy.
Hi, Duan.
Hi, Leiflin.
I watched some of you a little to the left stream.
What do you...
And I may have misheard you, but it sounded like you're not doing too well.
Oh, no.
Sorry.
My dad has gone home.
When I said I'm depressive, espresso.
What I meant is my dad's gone home.
So I'm sad, but I'm happy because I get to hang out with you.
You know, it cancels out the sadness.
As soon as I click end broadcast, it's fucking over for me.
That's all I'm saying.
I'm going to go cry in the bath.
I'm not even kidding.
I'm going to go cry in the bath.
I'm going to fully shave because I'm so fucking hairy.
Anonymous, Johnny.
Get us worked up then leaving us hanging.
That's cruel.
I'm so sorry.
I didn't mean it, Leiflin.
I got distracted.
My dad went home, so I'm sad.
Yeah, crying will record in the ASMR.
Honestly, though, we could always have Twitter spaces.
I'm going to say something so controversial.
I don't like Twitter.
I like putting my projects on Twitter being like, hey, I'm recording pregnancy ASMR.
Here's a picture.
Hey, I'm doing this with someone here.
Here's a picture.
I don't actually like the concept of Twitter and being like, hi, I'm in the bath, shaving
my hairy minge.
What am I supposed to tweet?
I don't get it.
In another life, I was basically forced to tweet every day and I was like, oh, I don't
like it.
I don't like it.
Please quit me right now.
You know?
Be happy.
Be happy.
Be happy.
Thank you, Kairon.
It's like TMI.
It's just no for me.
Oh my gosh.
Is that the Fibonacci sequence card from the hit video game, Baltro?
Thank you for the five gifted memberships math, 16, 18.
And congrats to those who caught it without this.
No, don't shave.
No, don't shave.
You're so pretty.
You're so pretty when I can't see the forest for the trees.
Twitter spaces are great.
The brain world is already here.
It's back, baby.
Hydration chip.
Okay.
I'll finish reading that, Maro.
But I'm sorry.
No, don't worry.
I promise.
Hopefully you know all the reeflings here about you and wish nothing but the best.
Yes, I'm so sorry to confuse you, reefling.
Please don't worry about me.
When I said I'm upset, it's because my dad's gone home.
And I love my dad very much.
And he's a hoot and a holler.
And it's very nice to have him around.
But the next time I'll see him is probably in like two years time, which was a bit rough.
It was like, ah, shit.
That's a rough name.
He said he doesn't think he can come on the plane next year to come see me, to come visit me.
And now he would come visit me if I asked.
If I said quit your fucking job right now and come over for like three months, then he would 100% do it.
So please don't worry.
It's not like that.
It's just it's most likely two years.
Like I showed my dad everything, like what I do work wise on that.
And he said hi to AC.
I don't know if I said it in the other stream, but don't worry if you weren't there.
He said hi to AC.
I was invoiced that way.
He could through just hanging out.
And I was like, oh, I was like, oh, dad, dad, dad, dad.
This is AC.
Say Privyat.
And he was like, what?
I was like, yeah, Privyat.
It means hello in Russian.
Go Privyat.
And he was like, Privyat.
And AC couldn't hear it sadly.
But we were having a goof over.
I was showing him my work.
I was like, so this is what I do for the girls and all of that.
And he was like 20%.
And I'm like, yep, 20%.
I don't want to be greed.
I'm anti-greed.
And he's like, yep, yep.
That sounds right.
That sounds about you, Johnny.
Did AC call him dad?
Don't.
No.
Don't.
Don't.
You're done.
You're done.
I'm farting on your eyelashes.
Open up your eyeballs right now.
Don't ever say that again.
Hi, Johnny.
Serious answer here.
OK.
Emmy and Laura is ginger.
But in her VTuber model, it's definitely more blonde.
And tell her she's ed in.
She is ed in her model, actually.
She is alternate in...
Emmy is so fantastic to work with.
Oh my God.
We like came to an agreement.
She's like, I think you guys have seen it.
So I'm allowed to talk about it.
And if she doesn't want me to talk about it.
Sorry, Emmy.
I love you.
I'll pay you 50 bucks to not be mad at me.
Emmy...
So Emmy's designed her 2.0.
But I had to say to her.
I love your 2.0.
But you need to let Emmy 1.0 be a thing for a little bit longer.
So we came to an agreement that she's going to get fixed up a little bit
to Emmy's image, which I'm 100% OK with.
Like, as I said, I want the girls to be happy with who they are.
Because at the end of the day, they've been given models, OK?
Like, Shebe, she's already told you.
Shebe's getting a more reflective version of herself on a model.
That's coming out soon to you.
I don't know when.
Nari's cooking.
Nari's cooking very hard right now.
She's a very busy modeler.
So please do have patience, but yes.
It's a 1.5 model.
She showed it on stream.
Yes, as I said, I'm Emmy, not Emily.
Did I say Emily?
Wait, why are you guys saying Emily?
Did I say Emily?
I did.
It must have started because in a mashed words together, you didn't.
OK, Emmy, Emmy, Emmy.
Emmy, Emmy, yeah, Emmy, yeah, Emmy, yeah.
Drank.
Swalalala.
Drank.
Swalalala.
But yes, as I said, I'm happy for the girls to, you know,
change things up and look the way they want.
But I do need her to still be very close to the original design,
and she was so good to work with.
Like I was passing on messages from the concept artists to each other
and being like, OK, you can do this, but don't do this,
because you need this and don't do that, because you need that.
And she was so good.
She was also so good to work on, so 10 out of 10.
Work with, sorry, on an objective.
On an objective.
And he looked, fuck, I'm dying.
Sorry, I just choked on my spit.
I'm trying to like talk and breathe and like swallow my spit at the same time,
because I'm so excited to get the next question out, OK?
He found a good bunch of daughters.
Bro, they found me.
I don't know how on earth they were crazy enough to go for it.
Bro, crazy.
But they did it.
And here we are.
I mean, fuck, here we are.
We're almost at like all of us are 10,000T subs.
I'm so excited to release that motherfucking artwork.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God, AC is almost 8K.
Oh, my God, I'm humping to death.
Hmm.
Wow.
And AC and Emmy have a collab coming out soon on AC's channel.
Sometimes when you get me bricked off, it doesn't go down for an hour.
Oh, no, four hours is dangerous.
Are you based on strong heim?
Strongest strong heim.
Sounds a bit familiar.
Oh, I am based after strontium, which is my dad's gamer tag, not the actual gamer tag
before you look up and be like, I find her dad relax.
It's not the actual gamer tag.
But unbelievably, actually, so we are debuts got clipped on this channel called smoothie
and someone replied under my comment and they were like, are you after strontium dog?
So this is the even more hidden lore behind my name.
So strontium dog is a comic my dad used to read.
And then he made his gamer tag like strontium.
It's not exactly strontium, so relax.
And then I called myself strontium.
And someone commented under and said, are you after strontium dog?
And I'm like, yes, what the eff.
The fact even you what strontium dog was was insane.
It was literally gone full circle.
Full circle.
Okay.
Throw that ass in a full circle.
And sorry, I'm super hyper today.
I fucking might be so much worse ones.
It's so nice to just not feel like stress.
Now, I love my dad.
Love me dad.
Love me refund.
Simple.
I felt like I was juggling a lot like normally a nap after streaming all of that.
And all of that jazz.
I'm almost caught up with the Elden Ring streams.
They start up in like two weeks again.
So I hope you're all Elden.
I hope you've got like your Elden Ring barfool.
Can't wait for your dad to be announced in gen two.
Oh my God.
That would be hilarious.
Hi guys, strontium here.
I would play the clip that I recorded with him, but he said my legal name in it.
I was like, I was like, I would just record in it so you can see what you want.
So instantly goes legal name.
And I'm like, okay, well, I'll need to edit that before I send it on to the editors.
And strontium's dad is going to be the best girl.
Oh my God.
The only male allowed on stream for real for real.
I managed to catch up to Elden Ring so he can help you out.
Oh yeah.
Go kiss me on your lips.
I'm going to help me in the flower field.
Sensor the name.
Bro, honestly.
We need a model for strontium's dad if he ever comes on a stream.
So we recorded a short of him guessing VTuber names.
And I said to him, if it goes viral, you realize you're going to have to get shipped out again so we can record more.
We would make him our Oshi.
Strontium.
The dad tubers, honestly.
No, my immersion.
That's my fucking dad.
No, don't troll when it comes to that.
I know idol culture, no male on stream.
But if I'm like, yeah, my dad.
That's my dad, okay?
Then he started making me get raged.
Then he made me enraged.
Dad tuber, real.
Since you're a cutfish, your dad model needs to be cracking.
Well, I'm going to get a doodle of him drawn for the shorts because when he talks, obviously it was just me sitting there staring at the screen.
But I need to like, who goes there?
I need to cut up the audio and then I need to get an insane amount of assets.
The short is going to cost so much money to get.
I mean, Strontium's dad is already in my kami Oshi.
You have a father.
I thought you were a cutfish.
Wait, cutfishes don't have dads.
Cutfishes don't have dads.
Are you getting me to type something into Google that makes no sense?
No.
First question that comes up.
Can you keep a cutfish as a pet?
Oh, whoa.
Can you keep a cutfish as a pet?
No, they're too smart.
Don't do it.
Wait, does that mean he would get a Patreon as a...
Stop!
Stop.
They definitely do have male progenitors.
Some people are that parasocial.
I bloody hope not when my fucking dad were...
I'm going to start fighting hands with the shadow people again.
It's been a day since my dad's gone and I'm already throwing hands with the shadow people.
Actually, you know what's really disgusting?
I've instantly stopped taking showers every morning and I know that he's gone.
Like, absolute minger.
Absolute minger.
Hi, Strontium.
Don't want to make you cry earlier or anything.
Don't worry.
It's reserved for the bath time.
But you're a wonderful goober and we'll never get sick of it.
If you're ever sad, we're here for you.
If you ever need help, we're here for you.
If you're ever raging hard, we're here to get our worded by you.
Strontium, love maxing.
We fling, love maxing.
Get kissed, get kissed, get kissed.
I just forced my tongue in your mouth when I go...
Honestly, that's terrible.
Let's see if that turns out okay.
Dude, Papa Cuttle's leave as a message.
Yes, he did, but I can't read it or I'm going to burst out crying.
I need to give it a few days before I be there.
But the TLDR is thanks for looking after my daughter whilst I couldn't.
And that's all I'm going to say before I start crying.
Hi, Strontium.
Hi, Bethling.
You and the rest of the girls are really inspiring.
Oh, yeah, you're inspired by the autism of your honor.
Thank you very much.
I wanted to be a content creator too.
Oh, yeah.
Come aboard.
Clam aboard.
Oh, no, I doubt I'll ever do an interesting audio.
Oh my god.
Shock and behavior.
I can't believe it.
You don't want to moan into the microphone.
But I was way too afraid or too busy.
But after seeing you guys have so much fun.
I want to do it too today.
I've been making original songs.
Oh my god, you can make the cat songs from...
You should play straight and then give the music man these music sheets
and then make songs off the top of your head.
I find it crazy that Carl Fish is motivating me
to get back to what I did this.
Thanks for pumping me up.
You got to know.
Pump it up.
We got to pump it up.
We got to know.
Now let me pump your clam with my ink.
Okay.
You're done.
You're done.
You're done, though.
Done.
Well, if you can write diss tracks, let me know.
Because I want the girls to do diss tracks on each other.
I think that's the funniest thing ever.
Oh, strongy cuddles.
More like strongy fumbles the bag.
Because what's with that 80-20 cut?
You literally are not going to get a yacht at that rate.
Whoa.
I can go straight, honestly.
That's what I need.
I so badly want diss tracks.
I want to, like, diss track.
Be a little bit more, like, feel the whores.
Stop.
Stop.
That's not funny.
Stop.
Stop.
Hi, strongy.
Hi, refling.
I love you so much.
I love you so much.
Sorry.
I'm getting so excited.
I'm at 10.
I need to turn it down to a 7.
Okay.
I need to turn it down to a 7.
Hi, strongy.
Hi, refling.
I don't mind if you don't shit.
Replay.
Also, don't shower so I can taste you.
Replay.
Napoleon Bonaparte back from the grave.
Jeez.
I'll rip your bones apart.
Bonaparte.
Turn your horse into glue.
That is a reference to horses being turned into glue.
That is an actual thing.
Hi, strongy.
Hi, refling.
You know, I want you to get comforted.
Get comforted.
Get comforted.
Pop, pop, pop, pop.
Comfort, comfort, comfort.
Will we ever get a horror game stream?
Yeah.
Technically, yes.
I'm very scared of horror games.
I scream in them and I have a heart rate monitor.
So, yes.
Eventually, it's probably going to be like a Donoth on reward because I get freaked out
in video games.
I get really good immersion when I play video games where I have tunnel vision and stuff.
So, that makes the first person horror games 10 times scarier because I feel like they're
going to touch my freaking back.
FNAF 1 would absolutely make me shit myself.
I'm not even kidding.
The chair would be ruined.
What was that person thinking?
I bet if I melted that horse, I could stick things together.
Can I teach you something?
They most likely were cooking the horse and then they were like, oh, it went really sticky.
That's weird.
And then it did it to another horse and then it went sticky and then it went another horse
and then it went sticky and then they realized they could make glue from it.
It's kind of like the cow drinking thing.
People were like, eh, he was the first human to figure out that cows get milk.
Motherfucker, you were breastfed.
Humans and mammals ain't that different.
Well, actually, I'm going to shit your pants right now.
Wait, no, I'm not going to shit your pants right now.
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
Wait, let me restart.
Humans are mammals.
Babies drink milk from boob.
Boob is also on cow.
Cow produces milk.
It's not some weird thing where a random guy taught cow in a field and went, oh, let me get some of that.
No, it was domestication of animals.
No, I'm not shitting your pants.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
No, I didn't mean that.
Shit your pants.
NO!
Honestly anonymous ain't no way my Aussie is interested in epic rap battles in history
Are you kidding me? I love that stuff, although I definitely haven't watched the newest stuff at all
Be gentle in your panty lin
What is she cooking something devious clearly? I just want a fresh pair who's gonna clean them your problem not mine. Oh
No, hold on I'm about to be proven wrong live on stream
I
Don't know I'm getting your reference sheets for the girls. Don't show me that
Don't show me that right. I'll be fair. I've even sent me the reference sheets of the girls. I'm getting your ones for them
If you want to save money, oh, I read that one. Oh my god. I'm out of our club. Hi. I'm new here to all this VTuber stuff
All right, I was just making sure you weren't asking anything
Okay, but I was hoping you could answer a few questions. I'm sorry if you answered them
Oh, yeah, of course. I wondered if there's a place where you will post your karaoke streams
I'll be working most likely when you miss it. Oh, I don't host it myself
And normally archive annons do it all for me. Thank you archive annons. You are the secret hidden people of the good stuff
Thank you. We appreciate you and
Yes, hopefully you don't mind if I ask but how would we know if something like cat rocks is broken? Oh
You just need to replace dot with the word dot and then I'll do the rest
If you want to send it, I'll just say link archive annons are the seventh member of veal or literally they work in over time
Their PCs are exploding
And fucking there they're they start quaking when Azura has a fucking legal edge and streams
They're little their knees are noblin. That's all I'm saying

It's similar to Hatsune Miku
You're gonna shit your pants when you learn what color hats and Miku's hair is that's fucking blue. She's bloody blue
You say cutfish candy be pits, but what about you? Oh, right? Okay. That was good. That was smooth. Okay. Let's do a let's do a

Strongy, you're my kind of woman. Oh, yeah
I'm a huge joker and I'm known to push buttons
I feel like a fun poking at you until your Scottish rage comes out
I don't get angry like I don't get angry a person I get angry at like an animate object like video game
Does that make sense?
Then I'd give you head pads and kiss
Your pout is better and cuddle my little seaweed until she smiles. I don't get angry at people. I don't find it hard
Like, I don't know how to get angry at someone
Only thing I've worried about with
Is getting hair in the teeth
No, no, you're not you're not that no we don't we don't do that here
We don't do that here you can eat the peach but you're not eating the clam
Okay, the clam does not want any attention. Please leave the clam alone
I should play League of Legends with Azura if I want to get angry. I don't I can't even comprehend the game
I think I've seen gameplay of it three times and I can't comprehend it. I
Don't know what I'm doing. It's like an enemy has been slain. Well, yeah
I mean doesn't death occur in this game an ally has been slain. Well, yeah, lady like change
Well, everyone's supposed to survive no clam attention. They've been a bane another or the beans different
The the peril of the clam is different
Nobody could comprehend it at the start. I don't make sense Johnny's hair color is yet. I
Like my hair. I love the style of it, but I'm a sucker for bunches and symmetrical hair. I'm absolutely suffer for it
Do you want to just grab my pony tails from behind my little twin tails?
I do technically a twin tail and I like that is double bunches. You can't see it from the front
Well, I guess you kind of can I have double bunches behind my
Seashells I have a I have a ponytail at the seashells create that bump and then I have them at the bottom of the hair as well
So I have double bunches and I love it. I love it
Your sucker sure. Hope so
Twin tail handlebars. Yeah, I
Love it. I love it. I love oh
Yeah, no that reminded me something's like oh your character so ugly compared to everyone else. I'm like
Nice try me nice try. I'm pure six. You can admit it. It's fine
Only thing I'm worried about oh already read that. How do you oh my god? Oh my god, there's no more marshmallow questions, right?
I'm going offline good night
Anyone else in that? Oh, there's no marshmallow questions. I went offline instantly. How do you know?
Yeah, but the cake. Yes, your honor. Probably
You see that again. Go rest. I
Should rest and what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna go for a nap, okay?
And then I'm gonna go for a bath and then I'm gonna deal with all the backlog of work because the video game has been delayed
surprise surprise me who didn't
Fucked up, but it's fine. The game's still playable. That's the main thing and still one-handable if you want. Um, I
Need to hand over all the audio assets now. Um
Which is gonna take a hot second to edit but once it's done
It's one of those jobs that like I can tick off the list
It's not like a reoccurring job like at the moment the shorts with the girls are like reoccurring jobs and they kill me
Um, because like it's not like I can take it off a list or anything
Eh, if Mercy doesn't have a room up she's
Oh, no, I'm going into rare
It's not out yet. No, um
When are we getting the official news about the game? Um, the game is free
Um free access. It will be uh posted on the alternative twitters
It will not be posted from the main account due to the content
Like the main VLR account due to the content inside the game
Can you post that?
Can you post that now you can so
I mean, maybe we could
Do it announce it, but then link the girls all no no, it's too risky. It's too risky. I'm not risking. I'm not risking it
Uh, also the girls are getting access to fansly on august 1st, so
Do without what you will
I don't know what they're planning, but how about you? What kind of content?
One-handed gameplay content
So play with headphones. Yeah, definitely
Um getting the debit card ready
We will be there, but when are you gonna be on it? I need a bit more
Time and what I'm gonna purposely do is let the girls go ahead and do what they want to like get as much support for them
Because they actually get 100 of their
VLR don't take any cut from their bandslay at all
Um, so I'd rather they like get success and like more stabilized income if they want to do it
But I have requested them like hey remember
YouTube's your main income source like don't don't be cut. I said to them and actually you can quote this the girls will quote that
I said don't come to me with five bandsly streams on your schedule
And they all agreed and they said yeah, that's fine
Yeah, hold on. I'm hydrating
Don't feel send on bad. Yeah, I said look hey your income sources YouTube like then he didn't mess this up
And the price is going to be same completely up to the girl. We do not take any cut from
Uh
We do not take any cut so we don't dictate the price the girls pick their prices whatever they're happy with
And not up to be aware of the agency because it's not stipulated in the contract at all
Um, are you winning son? Yeah, we defeated the enemy of the puzzle game, which is actually a really good game recommend
