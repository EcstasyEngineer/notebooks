1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,200
I've got to see high vlog length. I'm so sorry about being late. Oh, I'm 11 minutes late

2
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:11,700
Okay, no wonder everyone's peaking. I'd be peaking too shit. I'd be gone too

3
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:15,320
Not gonna lie chief. I'd be I'd be gone

4
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:17,880
Okay, I

5
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:21,960
Missed run. It's almost like she's here. She's she is here. She's just

6
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:29,120
We'll kid record an ASMR and whenever I go to record ASMR like and the sound effects

7
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:35,880
You don't just record like one minute of the sound effect like to have an hour. Sorry. I'm in the middle of a conversation

8
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:42,520
So when you record ASMR and especially when you record the fully sounds that you need

9
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,760
You don't just record one minute and then loop it and then that's it

10
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:52,680
No, you have to record like a decent amount of the sound or else

11
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:57,560
It's very obvious. You just look at the same thing over and over again, and it becomes un-relaxing

12
00:00:57,560 --> 00:01:00,320
It defeats the purpose of the ASMR. Okay?

13
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:07,280
Good morning. Good evening again afternoon. I apologize for being so severely late, but I promise I have a fan

14
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:11,360
Tastic reason as to why I have

15
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:17,080
Finally recorded the missing SFX that is needed for my collab with Poseidon

16
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:19,920
My update is the Yumi

17
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:26,440
Extrawny collab kiss kiss and is being edited as we speak. Hopefully. I don't know maybe I

18
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:36,120
Have also sent off here. You dropped this bread, but for the great. Thank you for the three extended membership

19
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:38,680
I also

20
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:40,680
sent off a

21
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:45,520
My 7k special ASMR is actually handcam

22
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:50,840
It's is very similar to the stream that occurred yesterday and reverberation

23
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:54,240
It was so similar that we were begging for

24
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:57,560
and

25
00:01:58,080 --> 00:02:00,640
The reason why the hip-kno

26
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:06,040
Turning into my pup has been changed is I do not have a fucking writer's bone in my body right now

27
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:08,240
I

28
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:13,120
Don't know if you have seen the tweet. You may or may not have seen the tweet from the official velour

29
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:15,880
Twitter

30
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:19,720
And management is looking to hire multiple script writers

31
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:21,800
and

32
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:27,160
so guess whose job it is to fucking make sure you write the way I like it and

33
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:31,600
It feels extra scumbaggy because

34
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:39,600
Basically, we have to give you a prompt and you have to rate it within I'll give so base

35
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:47,280
This game is silly have you played it before it just came out it came out last month, and

36
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:52,200
Yes, literally 12 hours after you ended the stream. Mmm. Okay, so nice

37
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:56,320
And pre-recorded chat. No

38
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:58,560
11th of September 2024

39
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:03,580
Strongly had a lot of fun and there was some wait is Brian talking. I can't hear him

40
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:06,920
Could you hear Brian there? I couldn't hear him

41
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:13,680
This stream was pre-recorded in the 11th of September 22 for strong. He had a lot of fun and there was some derpy moments

42
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:16,200
And

43
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:21,880
Similar so you're gonna get puppy mode again. No, I am taking a break from pop mode after the old

44
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:26,640
We can hear Brian, how the fuck can you hear Brian and I can't well, can you hear this?

45
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:31,720
Did you hear her?

46
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:39,440
Could you hear her? I don't know reflin. Are you a

47
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:44,040
Who gentlemen

48
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:50,640
And of course you can't hear because it's pre-recorded. Okay that one that's smart to shut fuck up

49
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:55,200
Okay, so I sent away a collab audio to be edited

50
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:03,720
Okay, but that wasn't all I sent away the hand cam pre-recorded video for a 7k celebration to be edited I

51
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:09,080
Then sent away 10 shorts the previous day to be edited. I

52
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:16,640
Also have a bonus short about ASMR that is being caught up now to be sent away to be edited

53
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:24,800
And then after today, I'm in the Poseidon collab sound effects

54
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:39,760
And then tomorrow I'm gonna send away the collab with me script

55
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:42,560
Oh

56
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:48,080
Did I miss the puppy hypno stream no

57
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:56,480
You didn't miss it and getting replaced and I'm gonna do it another bit, okay

58
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:00,920
So in the future, there's gonna be a hypnotizing you to be my puppy

59
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:03,760
video a stream, okay

60
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:16,200
But thank you for waiting on me you're such a oh, you're such a

61
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:21,960
I love

62
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:26,960
As proof this is pre-recorded story with an eye that's pre-recorded real. Oh

63
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:29,960
Brother this guy

64
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:35,520
Okay, so peggel in what is bagel in for a peggel in other than refling

65
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:38,240
Ah

66
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:40,600
You are

67
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:43,920
Beggel in for a peggel in and yes

68
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:49,960
This is replacing the hit no puppy screen stream because I have no writing bones in my body

69
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:53,160
and I

70
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:54,880
Have no

71
00:05:54,880 --> 00:06:00,160
Motherfucking writing things in my body because I'm gonna have to deal with those who are applying

72
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:04,200
But don't worry. It's all done through management. I will not directly talk to you

73
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:08,280
You have to get dealt with management

74
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:11,560
So this game is called peggel in it is pachinko based

75
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:16,400
Kind of RNG. It's almost similar to the dungeon clawler with guys guys

76
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:22,040
For more info on why we don't have the hypno see I highly recommend mummy's membership. You'll get interested in

77
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:24,400
Wait

78
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:30,480
No, wait, is there I don't know you had a different bone in you yesterday

79
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:33,160
Ah

80
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:37,360
Right, okay peggel in peggel in is a jackoff

81
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:43,760
Jack of all trades holy shit, right my brain hasn't woken up yet

82
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:49,000
Peggel in is a jack of all trades with with access to almost all orbs and relics

83
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:51,680
flexibility and adaptability

84
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:57,000
Adaptability are the keys and brown freight left at your new short with a ping

85
00:06:57,640 --> 00:07:02,320
Sin I genuinely thought that was my pain because I'm so used to it being like 300 fucking

86
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:05,680
400 I was like, yeah, this is an hour's character

87
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:13,200
Higher chatter number two. I can't wait for left for dead streams night. We should be tonight. Wait. No, I already happened

88
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:16,040
You're teasing it's not pre-recorded

89
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:23,440
Starting by like peg Lynn tuition battle rewards and chest contain additional options. Yeah, give me that whatever that is

90
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:31,080
Yeah, when a battle at least a hundred ten, right? Okay. No, give me the other thing. Yeah. Yeah, play that wherever that is

91
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:36,720
Start each battle with one plus must

92
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:39,240
must circle

93
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:44,920
Mercical must the call he'll six win reloading right. I've never played this by the way

94
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:48,000
Sin ASMR club win. What was sin?

95
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:56,000
Sin wait, sin. Can I say something inappropriate? Hold on. Let me DM you

96
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:59,440
Where are you? Where are you saying?

97
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:13,000
Sin can I see that on stream right of DM to her we'll find out if I'm allowed to see it on stream

98
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:19,840
Yeah, we're gonna find out live if I'm allowed to see it

99
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:23,840
It should probably be like shut the fuck up bitch. I'll be okay

100
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:30,840
Right, what's pink house of slime walls and bottom bones. No peace off ghost. I'm not doing slain

101
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:33,000
Sure

102
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:37,480
Slap on I've never played this I watched someone play it and it said it was Pachinko

103
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:41,640
And I was like this reminds me of dungeon claw alert where it's kind of just RNG be oh my god

104
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:44,560
You're so cute little refling a little El goblino

105
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:47,880
Permission to leak. Wait, did you see?

106
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:50,920
The third leak has hit the pentagon

107
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:54,760
She's not replied yet. Oh my god, I'm in trouble

108
00:08:55,840 --> 00:09:01,080
It's literally called Pachinko before anyone's like are you saying a slayer? No, I'm not saying a slayer

109
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:06,440
Right, so this is you up here top left or this is us

110
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:12,560
We're together in this this is us morph together because you're green and I'm green and then these are the enemy

111
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:15,560
Are you squiddin me right now? I don't know. Are you squiddin me right now?

112
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:17,720
You me guess what you me

113
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:24,960
Our edit got sent away. So the ASMR is coming. You need to send me a PNG of yourself. No

114
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:32,360
Send me a PNG of yourself. No or multiple PNG if I didn't ask for one yet because the video is getting made soon

115
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:35,960
Um, what the fuck upcoming purple slimes

116
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:37,960
pebble

117
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:43,560
Three three damage for a neutral four for a exclamation mark. No special effects. Okay

118
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:49,080
We're just analyzing. I watched someone play this for five seconds passed out and I was like, yeah, this game will do it

119
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:52,120
Right, okay. Let's just so there's 60 health

120
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:55,240
First the peeing of this she's got my colleague on please

121
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:57,160
I

122
00:09:57,160 --> 00:10:02,280
Sins laughing. So, you know how someone said uh, oh that was rather satisfying

123
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:07,480
Oh, that was the dagger does very little damage as a regular attack

124
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:11,160
But it's incredibly strong and a critical hit if you don't think you can hit this turn

125
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:14,840
You can disband the dagger by using the garbage icon. Oh, that's a bit sweet

126
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:17,320
um

127
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:21,720
Sin said I'm allowed to say uh, I'm doing a collab with she being a zero tonight. So

128
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:24,680
We'll get that sent your way

129
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:31,080
Um

130
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:33,480
It looks like a rogue like pachinko. It is

131
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:35,560
It's so cute

132
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:40,760
Right. Okay. So instead I can leak it. You know how someone said when are you collabing with sin on the ASMR?

133
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:43,560
Uh roleplay

134
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:45,240

135
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:47,240
Not in this life

136
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:50,680
In the next life

137
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:53,720
I

138
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:59,480
But what does that mean? What could that possibly mean?

139
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:03,160
What could it mean? No one knows

140
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:08,520
I'm just doing this at random by the way. I don't know. I'm just enjoying it is a cute little game

141
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:11,000

You should stop trolling now

164
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:51,480
How many lives do you have? I have no idea. This is genuine first time playing. I think it's fucking cute and adorable

165
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:54,920
I'm gonna work with the game studio. Sorry. I said it. I want to work with this game studio

166
00:12:55,880 --> 00:13:02,280
They're so cute the artworks like exactly what I want like if I were to produce video games is a

167
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:08,280
That tell me what I want. So this is the cutest fucking thing I've ever played in my life. Okay

168
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:14,600
The pre-recorded donations are cooking away shut up hired refling

169
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:18,840
Thank you for the tip, but it's just your bush. Right. I'm gonna hydrate with tea

170
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:25,240
Wait, what happened to slime rancher? Right

171
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:33,480
So, do you know the the the story of feature versus yapping through the tutorial then refusing to open up and look at anything

172
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:38,600
That would mildly help them and also perfectly dodging any serious advice and chat

173
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:41,160
You know that tale is all this time

174
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:45,720
I did that during slime rancher and gave up in an hour and 30 minutes into the game. Okay

175
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:52,440
Every reload grants balance. I don't know what that means projectile attacks will pierce their enemies with

176
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:58,200
Transparency excelling other original damage. Sure. Let's mop the floor with these enemies

177
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:04,040
Fuck yeah, holy shit. No, don't put me down there coach. I don't want to die. Jeez

178
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:09,880
What

179
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:13,160
Wait, am I dumb a little bit, but that's okay

180
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:18,920
Slime rancher is annoying. I think

181
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:24,040
Uh, I completely hunt. No, no the game's good. I'm sure the game is good

182
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:29,720
I just handicapped myself because I'm a dumb ass. I was yapping through the entire thing honestly, so don't mind me

183
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:32,680
Don't mind me

184
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:34,680
Is this girl just a battle? I think so

185
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:42,200
I'm excited for the part of this stream where strony gets stuck on that one boss for like 20 minutes and rages

186
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:46,600
I can fucking read that. I might not be able to hear that. I can read that you little shit

187
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:49,400
You little fucking shit

188
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:52,920
I love the terrible one

189
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:58,840
Thank you. I love food. Oh for the tip you stinker stinker tin

190
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:04,520
Hmm, I love this game so much. Wait, everyone's played this game, but me

191
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:10,520
It just looked like a cute little game. Is this a vtuber game? Ah, and no being funny. This is the first time

192
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:12,600
I've freaking seen the game

193
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:14,840
I'm a dumb ass

194
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:17,560
Have been like, oh this game just looks so

195
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:20,920
It's like a game

196
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:25,080
She said the thing never heard but I don't play this game anymore

197
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:29,160
This game has been available for early access for a while. Oh my god. My voice is cracking

198
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:31,960
Ah

199
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:36,600
Bouncy deals no damage heals you for each pegle hit permanently remove

200
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:41,480
From your deck after it's used right? Well, then what's that effing point of having it?

201
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:50,280
Let's do more attack strong attraction to be weak attraction to be a create effect is full strength for suit now

202
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:56,680
Yeah, we'll do that one sure add it and then upgrade an orb. I don't have enough money, but that's okay

203
00:15:57,560 --> 00:16:00,760
Look at us go. We're so cute. Oh, we're still fighting

204
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:05,640
Wait, so if I keep trying to go in the question mark, is it can I just like go down here?

205
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:11,160
It's a niche popular game. Uh, I've played it because it's a roguelike

206
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:14,120
Can't believe we're all binding of Isaac players out here

207
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:17,400
Who are binding the Isaacs? I'm doing it right now

208
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:19,480
My foot

209
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:25,000
You find a waterfall just off the path. What secrets made it behind you check behind the waterfall

210
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:28,280
Oh, yeah, take relic every 17

211
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:32,840
Hit has a random positive flame applied

212
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:38,840
You know how I feel about flying you find a hydrogen treasure behind the waterfall. That was so cute

213
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:41,240
Can I make it to the chair?

214
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:47,080
I am excited to know what flavors for gamers a padling reef line member stream

215
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:49,800
I bet you will like shy lily's flavor

216
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:52,440
Stop

217
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:55,400
People are gonna believe that it's pre-recorded

218
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:57,720
collecting

219
00:16:57,720 --> 00:16:59,720
collected

220
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:03,880
Our attacks gain plus one over our overall

221
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:08,680
Overall attack, I think that's probably the wrong move

222
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:11,320
It's gamble. Let's go gambling

223
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:18,040
Slime keep follow it only chance pre-recorded power glove is free value. The left is money adds damage as well

224
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:20,600
um

225
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:26,760
I got lucky with that choice then money increases damage. I prefer the glow because it fits like a glow

226
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:33,800
No, you fucking number in yourselves. How do you know?

227
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:38,680
I can't do this pre-recorded stuff anymore wake up reeflings. We need to fight back

228
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:42,920
No, get your hands off me. Um, let me go

229
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:49,240
Get your hands off me

230
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:52,840
Get your hands off my penis

231
00:17:54,920 --> 00:18:01,240
I think i'm playing this game terribly wrong by the way. I have no idea how this oh, it's an obelisk a dark obelisk

232
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:09,400
Looms before you it comes with the tantalizing power that you feel it's connected to the earth pray to receive its power

233
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:12,440
Force pebble into the obelisk

234
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:17,000
I will I will pray to receive its power. Oh dark obelisk

235
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:23,160
I pray to the flows into you call ceiling as a new obelisk pot one in your thing

236
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:28,280
What is the any of this me? I'm just happy to be here. Honestly. Um, I'm happy to be here. Oh

237
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:30,760
Oh by ball here

238
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:35,160
Thank you. Oh god. Thank you reefling three three seven two for the tip

239
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:41,080
Veiler streamer at strongy's next one is you're trying to wind me up and it's working. It is working

240
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:44,360
Oh, there's like a little elbow

241
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:48,060
Attack piercing enemy spinification

242
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:50,600
Infection

243
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:55,640
Right, let's do the poison stuff. That's what i'm here for. Sorry, but i'm actually here. No

244
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:58,200
Wait, I'll just buy one. Sure

245
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,600
What I don't

246
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:02,600
Uh, whatever. Right. I try and

247
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:07,800
That's the thing if you play the game for the first time live you just go for it

248
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:14,440
Fellas, what should I do with the one key for being a paid actor? Oh, is that how much i'm fucking paying you?

249
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:19,400
Holy shit. I'll repeat. Hi strongy. Hi me. Hi pinfall. Sorry

250
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:22,280
It

251
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:25,640
A free rock. It's a lovely rock

252
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:34,200
A attack supply for blind to enemies blind x enemies have a percentage chance to miss when attacking your

253
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:38,040
aimer is longer and displays an additional bounce. Nah

254
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:41,160
So let's do let's do a chance for missing

255
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:44,760
Uh, so am I supposed to do boss balls?

256
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:49,720
Is that where i'm getting money from and i'm constantly avoiding them? I think so

257
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:57,080
We're learning together. Yes, so I can literally just avoid all the bad boss battles all the way up to the end

258
00:19:57,880 --> 00:20:03,880
Right, we can get gunpowder activate nearby bombs. Oh, that was a good one

259
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:13,160
Uh, every four times the board is refreshed randomly game. Um, I actually want gunpowder. Can you like shove me over there?

260
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:16,040
Hmm

261
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:18,360
YouTube stop

262
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:26,440
YouTube pre-recorded tip. Hello streamer name. I'm very excited for finally seeing your live stream live stream name live and most

263
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:32,200
Certainly not pre-recorded. Stop it. You should pre-recorded tip. I'll show you a pre-recorded tip

264
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:37,320
Right, fuck it. We're going for the boss because I've

265
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:42,040
I've literally not got any money and I think it's because we're avoiding the boss phase

266
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:49,320
Hi, stony. Hi reflin. Are you serious the one time? I actually want the balls. Jeez. So am I about to

267
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:54,440
We're so dead. I'm just saying this right now. We're so dead

268
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:57,480
It's ogre, right

269
00:20:57,880 --> 00:21:01,160
How is he so moved up shifter tab? What does shift do?

270
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:03,880
This is shifter tab

271
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:07,720
Oh, that's who I can aim on right. Okay jacob plongs right hit that one

272
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:11,800
Hopefully we can get a few cheeky hits then. Nope. And that was awful

273
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:15,800
Well, I'm getting walloped

274
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:19,240
I'm getting walloped

275
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:22,040
Hmm. Oh, it's just something there

276
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:25,480
I'm getting walloped

277
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:32,920
Already dead already dead first place

278
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:37,320
I mean it's kind of like binding of Isaac to be honest that game does not care if you're a new player

279
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:42,280
Isaac couldn't give less of a shit. I think it took me like eight goes to get to win my first Isaac run

280
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:46,360
Um, and then I kept picking cane so I could huff the pills

281
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:50,040
Skipping all the fights to march towards the boss like a Chad. Thank you

282
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:57,560
The beauty lord get that gotta keep that positivity get it off, bro. We're so dying. There's no way

283
00:21:57,880 --> 00:22:01,640
There's genuinely no way. Okay. Yeah, there's the money ones. All the money ones are there

284
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:04,360
Whoa

285
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:07,720
Oh my brain chemistry enjoyed that

286
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:09,800
Oh man

287
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:14,600
Huh, holy shit

288
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:19,880
What just happened

289
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:24,280
Multi-ball causes orbs to split into two and hit. Oh, that looks like a good one

290
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:30,040
I got multi-ball. That wasn't I enjoy I thoroughly enjoyed that

291
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:34,200
I thoroughly enjoyed that. Okay, right. Definitely need to do more boss fight

292
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:36,760
Hmm

293
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:41,400
I don't want to put it in the fire. I'd rather aim and get something than nothing at all, you know

294
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:44,200
And bomb did the bomb thing

295
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:46,440
Nine percent of the time it works half of the time

296
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:49,880
Big bomb right. Let's finish this piece. It's already getting cold

297
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:52,920
Mm-hmm

298
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:56,760
You find a forge hot and ready to smelt yet oddly unattended

299
00:22:56,920 --> 00:23:03,720
You think that you could use it, but your little pecklin hands aren't oh your pecklin hands aren't made to handle the heat

300
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:09,800
Use your satchel to scoop up the forge a special relic take the smithing hammer a special remake

301
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:12,920
Use the forge to upgrade a random orb

302
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:19,800
I can take the damage. You're a little scolded, but your cauldron bubble has been upgraded

303
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:24,520
Six bucket six you're a little but your cauldron is now

304
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:28,520
free. Okay, that's enough. That's enough. Let's not get greedy now

305
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:33,160
Let's not be beggin for the pecklin

306
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:35,320
Hmm

307
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:41,320
You're gonna sleep to my stream. I don't think i'm a good streamer to sleep to

308
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,800
I feel like i'm gonna wake you up. I mean good night

309
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:50,120
But I feel like my asmr might be better for that in all honesty

310
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:53,880
I mean the asmr stream was really good only messed up once in it yesterday

311
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:59,720
And it got really popular. It's already at 11k views and i'm like damn

312
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:03,800
I didn't get my hands done more often like if you want hand cam asmr's

313
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:06,120
knock

314
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:10,280
I will happily do more hand cam asmr's if you guys enjoy it because that was fun

315
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:14,840
Like I like being able to show a bit myself because I feel like it's more like interactive more fun

316
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:16,760
but that's just my

317
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:23,720
Preferential way of consuming content is seeing a little bit more. Okay, that's just me

318
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:29,640
That's just my thoughts. That's my feelings. It's okay if our opinions differentiate. It doesn't mean i'm not gonna

319
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:32,280
Our word you're just because you think a little bit differently than me

320
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:35,240
um

That was such a good game of moves strong

330

338
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:09,880

I'm glad you enjoyed the titan fall stream, but I was screaming and hooting and hollering through thank you stash power

340
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:21,560
You find yourself looking at two identical altars each with a

341
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:26,040
Perfect location to place an orb. I would like to duplicate my

342
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:28,760
poison

343
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:37,160
No cauldron only on crit applies an additional effect. No, I'm going to duplicate this one because it's already op

344

Two more hand cam streams coming up and then I kind of take a pause and I might get new nails

346
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:56,440
To get it so then you can I'll see the new color and nails like that. Right. How much health do you go?

00:26:58,280 --> 00:27:03,800
Wait, wait, wait, wait. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. We have to take down a tree in order to get to the ball

349
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:07,720
Excuse me

350
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:14,040

Jake, thank you reverse for this tip. I fell asleep on it. There's alien stream last night and her screams and panic

357
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:41,400
I felt that when you said that right. So this is actually going

358
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:50,600
I

359
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:54,280
It's like right up in my face

360
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:03,160
Okay, I took a living out of me now the plan is in my way

361
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:09,400
Oh my gosh, sorry hold on actually needing to be tactical right now

362
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:14,840
No more me men no more shitpost and everyone lock in fuck. I balls that up so badly

363
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:18,280
I'm actually gonna die at the first boss

364
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:27,880
Oh the obelisk randomly came in and hurt him. I'm not gonna complain

365
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:32,200
Please go in the hole. No

366
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:37,800
Okay, the snowball is going for him

367
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:42,920
The snowball whatever that is. I don't know what the snowball is. I'm just happy to be here. Okay, right

368
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:49,240
We've got the crit hit, but are we just gonna go in the sink? Oh, we're sinking in the piss or repeating in the sink one or the other

369
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,000
Okay

370
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:54,920
Oh

371
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:56,920
The achievement was called olem olem

372
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:05,800
Okay, I like this. I like this. Wait the message said someone else is actually pre-recorded. No, don't think it's pre-recorded

373
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:07,800
They're trolling

374
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:13,160
Some orbs hit the first enemy in the role, but some others like the obelisk hit the enemy you've targeted

375
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:17,080
Ah, I like it. I like it. I like it. What is this death?

376
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:19,720
nest for battu

377
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:26,200
Heals you and damages target enemy fucking. Sorry. I'm just gonna say this off the bat this game. Oh my goodness

378
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:28,440
This game is fantastic

379
00:29:29,080 --> 00:29:32,920
The depth to it the aesthetics of the game

380
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:35,880
I um

381
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:39,320
I'm very blown away as a first-time player of this game. Oh

382
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:45,240
This is a multi-ball. I think I'd rather upgrade my multi-ball that we have

383
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:48,440
nest for battu. Heals you and damages the enemy

384
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:52,760
deals 15 unblockable self damage when fired

385
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:57,080
Self damage. No, right. I'm gonna upgrade orbs instead. Um

386
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:59,400
Um

387
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:05,800
Attacks all enemies one two for each pebble in your deck, right?

388
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:10,280
I think we'll upgrade that because that's literally

389
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,000
Right, we'll upgrade another one. Um

390
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:16,360
I hit an orb to make contact with them in most cases

391
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:21,720
Weak regular damage massive on crit obelisk to

392
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:24,760
multi-ball

393
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:27,960
I think I'll upgrade multi-ball as well multi-kill

394
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:30,840
Take a relic

395
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:36,680
This game has very nice red. Ah, honestly, I'm Jin though error unidentified argument pre-recorded message

They're gonna believe you

398
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:47,880
Honestly, someone's gonna come in for the first time and be like, I've heard about that strony girl. She's that scottish

399
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:53,320

401
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:57,480

402
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:04,600
Crazy jessey, thank you for the fab the tape. Don't believe her lies. It's really

You're winding me up and it's work. Oh, wait. No, that was another tip that someone said fuck

404
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:16,120
I played right into your hands

405
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:20,120
Damn it. I'm fucking such a creature of habit

406
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:27,000
I'm such a creature of habit. I'm such a creature of habit. I say the same things all the time

407
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:35,000
I say the same things all the time. That's how you can predict the house Johnny. How are you slain even new chargers are pre-recorded and

408
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:40,120

410
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:48,840
Kinetic meteorite every free hits provides explosive force until the board is refreshed

411
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:53,800
Attack deals two times damage for every unit as a downgrade. No

412
00:31:54,920 --> 00:32:00,280
Become weaker. No, you can no longer obtain money in battles, but your current shots. What?

413
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:04,200
I guess kinetic meteor

414
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:09,560

Sorry, this game is so satisfying. I don't even have to think and stuff keeps happening. Don't mind if I do

434
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:37,320
I think I'd rather keep upgrading my orbs to be honest. What was that bomb one?

435
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:40,200
Can I have the bomb one again?

436

444
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:13,480
Honestly, though a little bit to the left

445
00:34:13,720 --> 00:34:18,120
Friggin pro gamer. I don't know why I didn't move the cursor a little bit. Right. What is this?

446
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:24,440
Mirrors we're breaking mirrors enemies with projectile

447
00:34:25,720 --> 00:34:31,160
Projectile reflect will return of the dealt damage to them by the attack

448
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:35,160
Well, the better not because I'm gonna start feeling really attacked. Okay

449
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:40,040
Wait, what is the mirror? Oh the map is a mirror

450
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:48,440
Mama according to script nothing 24. Oh, yeah. No pop off pop off break them. Mirrors break them

451
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:51,480
Is this true in new to this?

456
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:17,800
I'm new to the pre-recorded stuff. Also, you're gonna love this game and we'll repeat that a lot

457
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:23,080

458
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:26,920
Reluctantly say mommy you need to stop playing all these good-looking games

459
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:32,200
My spirit is willing but my wallet is empty. Honestly. Did I tell you since debut?

460
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:38,520
I've spent like 800 dollars on video games. I'm like, I have never bought so many video games in my life

461
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:44,680
In my life since becoming a vtuber and there's no steam sale on there's no nothing on

462
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:49,560
So don't be surprised when I start pal popping up where xbox game pass games

463
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:52,200
because yeah

464
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:56,600
The stream strongest steam strongest customer honestly

465
00:35:58,040 --> 00:36:02,600
Like now don't get me wrong. I do play games every single day, but a lot of them is like I've never played them

466
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:04,600
Or I don't have them type thing. Um

467
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:10,600
And yeah, I guess expensive fast like this game was 30 doll 30

468
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:15,160
australian dollars or 20 united states dollars

469
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:16,840
um

470
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:22,360
But like I didn't want to I don't want to cheap out especially when it comes to indie devs or smaller studios

471
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:25,080
I don't like cheaping out. I don't mind the old

472
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:33,480
Emulation moment when it comes to like fucking dead and gone games because it's like well, you've given us absolutely nothing to make

479
00:36:52,120 --> 00:36:56,040
twos company applies double damage flames to everything

480
00:36:57,400 --> 00:37:04,600
Hmm, I try to just keep upgrading to be honest. I feel like if you you just like go nuts for it

481
00:37:06,040 --> 00:37:08,680
Like you just go absolutely ape shit McGee

482
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:15,240
Then you know you're winning because everything's gonna be like effective, you know

483
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:22,120
Hmm, mommy, where's my paycheck? Uh, I guess we'll go straight down just

484
00:37:24,120 --> 00:37:32,040
A fee or it's super expensive especially now that every game has a 30 dollar expansion to literally like I remember my dad telling me

485
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:35,080
like how dlc's worked in the past

486
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:38,600
dlc's were literally like

487
00:37:39,180 --> 00:37:45,000
Expected for free. There was no price point on them. It was just an update to your game to like keep it going type thing

488
00:37:45,080 --> 00:37:47,080
like I remember

489
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:49,640
Star Wars battlefront

490
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:56,440
And and I called it the piggy wiggies dlc because the map jabba's palace was a dlc

491
00:37:56,840 --> 00:38:00,920
And surprise surprise it was free. So I used to be like, I'm gonna play the piggy wiggie map

492
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:03,400
And my dad had to explain to me like

493
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:07,800
He needs to download it first and it's like a day to download or something like that

494
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:09,960
and

495
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:13,880
I'm like horse armor. Oh, what's that reference to world of warcraft?

496
00:38:15,160 --> 00:38:19,560
Free dlc the piggy wiggies the piggy. That's what jabba's

497
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:22,040
um

498
00:38:22,040 --> 00:38:24,040
Helpers are called. They're piggy wiggies

499
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:26,840
um, just like the uga da bees

500
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:29,640
uh for the um

501
00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:33,480
Ugini they're uga da bees. I've forgotten their name

502
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:36,600
The ones on tasuin with the wee eyeballs

503
00:38:37,240 --> 00:38:39,240
No, they're

504
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:41,240
The other ones that got hurt

505
00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:45,240
Multiple large dark obelisks luminescently in front of you

506
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:51,000
They are collectively humming so powerfully that the earth itself seems to bend at their will

507
00:38:51,560 --> 00:38:54,280
Pre compare all of your little into obelisks

508
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:57,400
Oh, wow

509
00:38:58,440 --> 00:39:03,880
I feel like that would completely change the run of the game which i'm a bit hesitant to do

510
00:39:04,120 --> 00:39:06,120
I'm a bit of a panini pussettes

511
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:11,960
Prostino, thank you for the extended membership jokes on you mommy since you keep playing games. I have

512
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:16,440
Left forgotten. I keep rediscovering all these nice games. Oh

513
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:20,760
Oh, we prostitutes

514
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:26,760
Jawas have the red uh jawas. That's what they're called. They're called uga da bees in the cuddles house

515
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:31,160
Um, well, this is a really unique map. Holy moly

516
00:39:32,680 --> 00:39:34,440
very whoa

517
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:39,640
That ball is bouncing. I don't know about you, but that thing is going

518
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:43,640
And I got the crit

519
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:54,600
Oh, is that it? Oh the obelisk coming right on down

520
00:39:57,240 --> 00:39:59,240
Nothing is free

521
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:04,440
She's doing the thing where she asks the question it doesn't leave people answering it. What was my question?

522
00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:07,720
Have we forgotten the free online content?

523
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:09,480
Got her

524
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:14,360
Got in it makes her shitty orbs. We better pickle boards are basically packed filler trash

525
00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:17,080
Oh, did I mess up?

526
00:40:19,640 --> 00:40:21,960
Love you. Thank you for watching my terrible gameplay

527
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:27,800
I don't know if people find it fun watching someone play a game for the first time and like completely mess up

528
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:31,320
Or if it's just like dear god women stop it

529
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:36,520
You're slaughtering us horse armor with a dlc and elden scrolls of bolivian. Oh, okay

530
00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:44,040
I can't believe it. Oh, okay, then bombs are

531
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:49,240
Really helping like a really really helping. I need more bombs

532
00:40:50,680 --> 00:40:52,680
Bomb give me bomb stuff

533
00:40:53,560 --> 00:40:55,560
She do be pegging wait

534
00:40:57,320 --> 00:41:04,520
Oh, I love first places get to see the streamers actual reaction in the game. I love it. I think it's cute af like I know we're not gonna win

535
00:41:05,320 --> 00:41:06,440
Um

536
00:41:06,440 --> 00:41:08,840
If I remember correctly from reading it

537
00:41:09,320 --> 00:41:14,440
So there's the forest there's the castle and then there's um, I believe the mines

538
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,000
Is where we're heading next

539
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:22,440
Because you're in the mineshaft looking for diamonds. I'm in the mines looking for

540
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:31,080
Um, three acts per run. Yes. So at least we've done we've technically done way better than I could have anticipated

541
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:33,800
okay

542
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:35,080
um

543
00:41:35,080 --> 00:41:38,920
The bomb still every more than oh, we're gonna upgrade

544
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:41,720
Upgrade an orb

545
00:41:41,720 --> 00:41:46,440
We're why is it not letting me upgrade the other ones are my arms getting blown the fuck up this shit or something

546
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:50,200
Uh, a multi-ball. I'll upgrade the multi-ball. I love

547
00:41:50,440 --> 00:41:53,720
Oh, I can upgrade further. Oh, can you not only oh, you can't

548
00:41:57,240 --> 00:42:00,680
I should probably should have read that I love watching people play a game for the first time

549
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:02,120
It's always lots of fun

550
00:42:02,680 --> 00:42:08,440
I wonder if it's like if it's your game like when you've played before and you're just like, oh

551
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,000
Like you're just creaming your crackers

552
00:42:12,120 --> 00:42:14,120
Thank you for the tip crazy jesse

553
00:42:15,080 --> 00:42:20,040
32 am I supposed to say 32 am I a bad streamer if I don't see the numbers at the end of your name

554
00:42:20,600 --> 00:42:22,600
After you've given me your monetary

555
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:25,800
Your monetary worldly possession

556
00:42:26,760 --> 00:42:28,760
Yeah, that bomb is oh

557
00:42:32,520 --> 00:42:34,520
Shadow wizard money gang

558
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:38,840
Huh wait, why did they die because they hit me?

559
00:42:42,040 --> 00:42:47,560
No, we already hit repeat. I think I would backseat rage at league gameplay. Um

560
00:42:49,880 --> 00:42:55,320
I'm gonna be honest. It's gonna be very hard for me to get on legal edge and as all I'm saying to that

561
00:42:55,400 --> 00:42:59,400
I'll never say never but I feel like that's more like a punishment stream

562
00:43:00,840 --> 00:43:03,320
Just feel like what it's a punishment for me

563
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:07,000
And it's also a punishment for you and the reason for that is

564
00:43:07,480 --> 00:43:11,320
You have to watch me play a game that I've never like had that type before

565
00:43:11,960 --> 00:43:17,240
And I mean, it's legal legends. Need I say more league is a punishment stream literally

566
00:43:17,320 --> 00:43:22,360
I'd rather just do a spank stream after that every time I die and over watch or something just

567
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:27,560
Just five paddlings. Okay. I think that would be a good mix. I don't know about you

568
00:43:28,760 --> 00:43:30,760
I feel like that would be a good mix

569
00:43:31,320 --> 00:43:33,320
tune

570
00:43:34,280 --> 00:43:39,480
Punish me with league gameplay mommy vtuber punishes you with league gameplay is more when

571
00:43:40,360 --> 00:43:45,800
Right, so these are just regular balls, which I could have upgraded at that obelisk

572
00:43:45,960 --> 00:43:49,880
But because I didn't reach out in time and I'm a dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb

573
00:43:51,160 --> 00:43:54,360
I'm a man reeflands. Congrats on three months of monetization

574
00:43:55,720 --> 00:43:57,720
Imagine if they took it away

575
00:43:58,600 --> 00:44:00,600
Imagine if it was over

576
00:44:01,240 --> 00:44:05,880
Did you see per ac has to beg for a fucking review on twitter?

577
00:44:06,440 --> 00:44:11,560
Anyone else who plays that game no problem tons of content comes with highlight videos

578
00:44:12,120 --> 00:44:19,400
And then ac plays it in a highlight video. Uh, you have you have actually done something against her nudity and polizu

579
00:44:19,480 --> 00:44:21,480
Or no, no, she's not

580
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:26,360
Uh, I've seen the highlight video. There's absolutely nothing wrong with that

581
00:44:28,680 --> 00:44:32,520
Uh, yeah, let us let us pray that the monetization stays amen

582
00:44:32,680 --> 00:44:39,160
You inked before I gave you permission to ink, you know what that means three games of legal legends

583
00:44:39,240 --> 00:44:42,120
I'm playing jinx our bagsy jinx

584
00:44:43,560 --> 00:44:45,720
Come and join me

585
00:44:46,520 --> 00:44:48,520
Come and play

586
00:44:48,600 --> 00:44:52,760
Or I might shoot you in your face

587
00:44:54,120 --> 00:44:58,120
Bombs and bullets will do the

588
00:44:59,080 --> 00:45:01,080
You

589
00:45:03,240 --> 00:45:10,200
Half glass half ball uh transparency projectile tactile pierced through enemies. Oh

590
00:45:11,480 --> 00:45:13,480
That looks good

591
00:45:14,280 --> 00:45:16,280
That looks very good

592
00:45:17,400 --> 00:45:18,760
Oh

593
00:45:18,760 --> 00:45:26,600
Branch of ember when applying bramble to an enemy apply bind plus two. I don't know what the fuck bramble is whenever

594
00:45:27,560 --> 00:45:36,040
Ball work is gained increase the amount gained by to convert. Oh, whenever it is hit convert to to

595
00:45:38,360 --> 00:45:43,560
Whenever ball work is gained ball work is armor that protects hb. Well, I don't even have that

596
00:45:44,120 --> 00:45:48,920
Bramble is enemies are unable to move. Well, I don't even have any hint for that either

597
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:55,480
So it's going on here or hit when I orb make contact with them in most cases orbs activate when it's hit whenever

598
00:45:55,560 --> 00:45:57,560
Uses hit convert to

599
00:45:58,600 --> 00:46:02,360
What does that mean? I don't know what it means. Fuck it in your backpack you get

600
00:46:05,560 --> 00:46:08,520
Uh, right, let's just go straight for the boss boom

601
00:46:10,760 --> 00:46:16,440
I love scholars guy. Hello boys. Is that what you consider it? Good morning everyone today

602
00:46:16,520 --> 00:46:18,520
I'm going to teach you about

603
00:46:18,680 --> 00:46:20,280
Gotland

604
00:46:20,280 --> 00:46:23,320
No, no, it's okay. I pro wait what?

605
00:46:24,120 --> 00:46:29,960
Oh, that's okay. I'll give it that's really cool and creative like it it changes and just

606
00:46:30,600 --> 00:46:32,600
and it appears

607
00:46:33,800 --> 00:46:37,880
I definitely need to heal after this one though. I'm needing a bit of cheeky more

608
00:46:38,440 --> 00:46:40,440
Bit more of a cheeky brickie

609
00:46:40,760 --> 00:46:47,000
Da da cheeky brick. When you hit a crit two normal orbs become critical orbs. Oh my god

610
00:46:48,200 --> 00:46:50,200
Could you imagine all the damage?

611
00:46:50,200 --> 00:46:52,200
Yeah

612
00:46:52,360 --> 00:46:55,400
Mummy serves the tag is a smile right today

613
00:46:55,560 --> 00:47:00,200
I'm going to teach you how to make meats and patties and a bit of mince on the side

614
00:47:00,600 --> 00:47:06,680
Well, it's haggis on the side. Let's be honest, but mince and patties is a really common dinner as well

615
00:47:07,480 --> 00:47:14,200
I actually really miss having mince and patties. It literally is as boring as it sounds just straight up

616
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:21,240
Um bit of mince bit of gravy boiled potatoes. It's like the blandest dinner you could ask for

617
00:47:21,480 --> 00:47:23,800
I need these ours, but they're down here

618
00:47:24,920 --> 00:47:28,760
I'm in trouble. I can't reach these ours down here. Oh

619
00:47:30,520 --> 00:47:35,880
Okay, it was a bit of a throw, but we do have the map back, which is the main thing

620
00:47:37,640 --> 00:47:39,640
Yeah, definitely to heal after this one

621
00:47:40,600 --> 00:47:44,040
We do have two balls. We have two balls in the crit. Oh

622
00:47:44,760 --> 00:47:45,800
Oh

623
00:47:45,800 --> 00:47:48,600
The sound design of this game is peak. Oh

624
00:47:49,720 --> 00:47:51,720
Oh, I'm so curious what happened

625
00:47:52,280 --> 00:47:53,480
Oh

626
00:47:53,480 --> 00:47:55,480
That thing is sneaking about the map

627
00:47:57,880 --> 00:48:00,760
Stranny, what's your favorite scottish season insult or pepper?

628
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:06,440
You're laughing but we put salt on sandwiches and we put salt in part in porridge

629
00:48:06,600 --> 00:48:08,920
So honestly, I can't even defend it

630
00:48:10,600 --> 00:48:15,480
I can't even defend it, but the first thing it gets 20

631
00:48:20,600 --> 00:48:25,000
It's 20 plus what 20 plus damage, I don't know. I feel like I'm better just like

632
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:28,600
How much money do I have?

633
00:48:28,600 --> 00:48:30,600
Hold on first heal

634
00:48:31,400 --> 00:48:35,000
And then let's upgrade or or be stuff

635
00:48:35,720 --> 00:48:38,920
I don't want anything in my arsenal that's like weak

636
00:48:39,640 --> 00:48:43,960
We can go for treasurer boss. I feel wait that heal didn't fully heal me

637
00:48:44,760 --> 00:48:46,760
Bro take me to the treasure room. I'm off

638
00:48:49,320 --> 00:48:50,760
Hmm

639
00:48:50,760 --> 00:48:56,040
Even on sandwiches. Yes, my gran would fucking put salt on sandwiches when she made them for me

640
00:48:56,280 --> 00:48:58,760
I used to have like cucumber, um

641
00:48:59,720 --> 00:49:01,720
and

642
00:49:01,720 --> 00:49:03,720
I

Sorry, I fucked up for she beat me. Um battle start with five extra

644
00:49:15,240 --> 00:49:18,040

00:49:18,920 --> 00:49:20,920
Oh

646
00:49:21,880 --> 00:49:24,440
Oh, that seems like a really good thing in my Boba

647
00:49:25,640 --> 00:49:28,440
It's only 20 heal and you were done for a damn

648
00:49:28,840 --> 00:49:31,880
Right, why is that one death and that one's not death?

649
00:49:33,640 --> 00:49:40,520
Salt and pepper on sandwiches, you know, I really missed wait. What was that mini boss? Oh sugar. Maybe I should have done the mini boss

650
00:49:41,640 --> 00:49:46,280

655
00:50:01,160 --> 00:50:03,880
I missed deep fried pizza so badly

656
00:50:04,920 --> 00:50:11,880
I just it's so delicious and not nutritious. It clogs your arteries. It's absolutely terrible for you

657
00:50:12,280 --> 00:50:14,280
But it's so good

658
00:50:14,440 --> 00:50:16,440
It's so good

659
00:50:17,400 --> 00:50:19,400
Little deep fried pizza

660
00:50:20,840 --> 00:50:23,320
Oh my god, I love these thumbs

661
00:50:23,720 --> 00:50:25,720
Oh

663
00:50:34,120 --> 00:50:36,120
I've seen um

665
00:50:46,440 --> 00:50:48,440
Uh, and I'm like

00:50:48,760 --> 00:50:54,600
I've never even properly eaten a pixel a pixel a pickle my deep fried pizza sounds every

667
00:50:55,160 --> 00:51:01,080
Triggered applies one exploit ball can't target any enemy. Oh, I like the look of him

668
00:51:01,960 --> 00:51:07,080
Mama is this really a pre-recorded? Oh, I like him. Sorry. Oh, I should have healed. You are not her cause

669

Mm-hmm

672
00:51:21,880 --> 00:51:24,040

Oh, thank god

675
00:51:35,880 --> 00:51:37,880
A ballad my beloved

676
00:51:38,440 --> 00:51:40,440
Mmm

677
00:51:40,760 --> 00:51:48,040
Is deep fried pizza just no, it's like literally put pizza in a deep fryer in a vat of oil and bubble that shit

678
00:51:48,360 --> 00:51:55,080
Whenever you gain gain an additional one. Well, I don't have that whenever slime whenever slime is applied to

679
00:51:55,560 --> 00:51:58,680
It gets a good slime. Sure. I'll take a good one. That looks cute

680
00:51:59,720 --> 00:52:01,720
But Lord we even deep fried butter here

681
00:52:04,440 --> 00:52:07,400
The thought of that makes me want to gag I'm not gonna lie

682
00:52:08,600 --> 00:52:10,600
Please don't do that

683
00:52:10,840 --> 00:52:16,040
Please don't eat that either. It sounds stupid, but it's delicious. But then it's not stupid, honestly

684
00:52:16,200 --> 00:52:18,120
We deep fried mars bars as well

685
00:52:18,120 --> 00:52:22,680
You stumble onto a strange mirror with shadows flickering in the reflection

686
00:52:23,080 --> 00:52:24,680
You're drawn

687
00:52:24,680 --> 00:52:29,560
Closer and closer until your nose is nearly touching the glass the shadows are speaking a language you've never heard before

688
00:52:29,960 --> 00:52:34,200
Oh my god, they're Scottish, but you understand their offer remove an orb

689
00:52:34,840 --> 00:52:36,840
Remove all orbs

690
00:52:37,880 --> 00:52:39,880
No

691
00:52:41,080 --> 00:52:44,680
Wait, I can't get away. What do I pick?

692
00:52:48,440 --> 00:52:51,240
What one do I pick I can't get away. There's no like

693
00:52:51,880 --> 00:52:54,680
Remove all orbs. Fuck you the shadow in the middle

694
00:52:55,160 --> 00:52:55,880
Mither

695
00:52:55,880 --> 00:53:01,560
Mither mirror offers to ease your burdens and you accept you feel a slight sense of dread as your satchel empties in the world

696
00:53:01,720 --> 00:53:07,320
Fades black around you you awaken sometime later with a mysterious new orb boros

697
00:53:07,880 --> 00:53:10,040
As the sole content of your satchel

698
00:53:10,840 --> 00:53:12,840
Now you lost everything you upgraded

699
00:53:19,880 --> 00:53:21,880
You fucking what

700
00:53:25,880 --> 00:53:27,880
I did what

701
00:53:35,240 --> 00:53:37,240
Are you serious

702
00:53:38,440 --> 00:53:40,440
Are

703
00:53:42,280 --> 00:53:46,840
Are you fucking we're on the second boss

704
00:53:49,320 --> 00:53:51,480
Why is that even an option?

705
00:53:56,760 --> 00:54:01,240
What have I got this these are the only attributes I have

706
00:54:07,880 --> 00:54:09,880
Um

707
00:54:18,600 --> 00:54:22,840
Analysing I'm an idiot. Okay

708
00:54:24,840 --> 00:54:29,320
Game day, I'm not sure what the benefit of that was I'm gonna be honest to be your chief

709
00:54:29,560 --> 00:54:37,160
I'm not sure why you didn't learn game. You put it in game for freaking gamers like me that aren't paying attention and don't understand

710
00:54:38,040 --> 00:54:40,040
Oh

711
00:54:40,680 --> 00:54:44,920
My god, I was seven thousand seven thousand

712
00:54:47,320 --> 00:54:55,240
I had seven thousand and I'm doing like 200 damage a swatch. Are you serious as ogre the run is ogre due to my stupidity?

713
00:54:58,280 --> 00:55:01,960
Oh, please yes heal. I don't know what's healing me, but I'll take it

714
00:55:03,240 --> 00:55:05,240
How much is that?

715
00:55:06,200 --> 00:55:08,200
400

716
00:55:08,520 --> 00:55:14,680
That thing's approaching a bit projectile attacks will pierce through enemies, right? Okay, but do more

717
00:55:17,160 --> 00:55:20,520
I need more heals. I need everything I need stonks

718
00:55:22,280 --> 00:55:26,360
These fucking balls better be good purses three echo 40

719
00:55:27,080 --> 00:55:30,440
179 deals four damage to self when discarded

720
00:55:31,240 --> 00:55:33,240
Good thing. I'm no discarding them

721
00:55:34,040 --> 00:55:36,040
Or is every time that goes in the bin

722
00:55:36,360 --> 00:55:38,360
It attacks me

723
00:55:39,800 --> 00:55:43,720
Oh my god, you're gonna need to start popping out of the fucking wazoo

724
00:55:45,160 --> 00:55:47,160
The echo keeps going up though

725
00:55:47,320 --> 00:55:50,600
Two four three echo deals echo x deals

726
00:55:51,400 --> 00:55:54,600
percentage of the previous attack damage as bonus damage

727
00:55:54,600 --> 00:55:56,600
I

728
00:55:58,120 --> 00:56:00,920
I'm stressed. We've only done 1.6k damage

729
00:56:01,720 --> 00:56:03,720
1.6k damage

730
00:56:04,120 --> 00:56:08,120
No discard is skipping the orb. I've never even I don't even know how to do that mechanic

731
00:56:12,760 --> 00:56:14,760
700 okay, okay

732
00:56:15,800 --> 00:56:19,560
We've done what 2.2 roughly

733
00:56:20,360 --> 00:56:27,880
Okay, please continue doing what you're doing. Okay, please continue so that right 300 damage. Ha ha wait wrong crepe

734
00:56:28,760 --> 00:56:31,320
Wrong crepe. We're fully healing up though

735
00:56:32,680 --> 00:56:33,880
Uh

736
00:56:33,880 --> 00:56:41,960
Momolo, thank you for the extended membership two months. Hello momo. I'm late. I fell asleep. You're allowed to you're allowed to rest, you know

737
00:56:42,920 --> 00:56:47,720
As much as I like squiddin around with you. You are allowed to rest or else

738
00:56:47,800 --> 00:56:51,000
How are you supposed to do struggle snuggles with me, huh?

739
00:56:51,400 --> 00:56:56,040
Also green gang gang gang gang gang right? I think we're doing a thousand in this

740
00:56:56,120 --> 00:56:59,800
So we're officially 50 hp after this wallet. I'll take it

741
00:57:00,920 --> 00:57:02,920
Fucking hell that thing's going

742
00:57:04,600 --> 00:57:06,600
1.2 damage

743
00:57:07,720 --> 00:57:09,720
Can we get 1.3?

744
00:57:10,520 --> 00:57:13,160
1.3k damage

745
00:57:14,920 --> 00:57:16,920
Come on 1.3

746
00:57:18,040 --> 00:57:23,640
I'm next bidder 1.4 for the next bidder. Please 1.4. Can I get 1.5 for the next bidder?

747
00:57:24,600 --> 00:57:26,600
1.5

748
00:57:27,160 --> 00:57:32,280
Can we do 1.6 next bid 1.6 who's got 1.6 in the audience 1.6

749
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:35,960
1.6 in the audience. She should she scores

750
00:57:36,920 --> 00:57:38,440
Oh

751
00:57:38,440 --> 00:57:42,680
My goodness golly. She should she scores

752
00:57:44,360 --> 00:57:48,360
Crazy jessie. Thank you for the tip sleep is for the week

753
00:57:48,600 --> 00:57:51,960
No, a replay is no need of it as much as it pains me to admit right

754
00:57:51,960 --> 00:57:56,200
I need that reset and they're both at the bottom of the board and that one's right in the way

755
00:57:57,400 --> 00:57:59,240
Oh dear

756
00:57:59,240 --> 00:58:03,480
Oh dear not a very good one not a very good one at all. We are 2k

757
00:58:03,960 --> 00:58:08,280
He does seem to have mobility issues not to make fun of those who are

758
00:58:10,200 --> 00:58:11,640
No

759
00:58:11,640 --> 00:58:16,760
Right, sorry the ai actually literally targeted that to go there because why did it ping

760
00:58:17,320 --> 00:58:21,640
Stop right no the ai is purposefully putting it in the hole

761
00:58:22,680 --> 00:58:29,400
There is one hole on this map and it is making sure it pings all the way over there

762
00:58:30,040 --> 00:58:34,120
Stop it. You know, I want the reset. Stop going over there

763
00:58:34,440 --> 00:58:39,720
No, I'm getting trolled right now. Please tell me you guys can see that this is calculated

764
00:58:40,520 --> 00:58:47,480
This is actually calculated. Look how far to the like left side of the board. I am and there's one hole

765
00:58:50,600 --> 00:58:52,600
Even the games against me

766
00:58:54,520 --> 00:58:58,280
Am I not finished right? No, I'm not 1.5k right, okay

767
00:59:00,360 --> 00:59:06,860
Okay, we need to do 1k damage and we're good. I don't think he's even going to be able to hit me. We're getting so lucky

768
00:59:07,880 --> 00:59:11,960
Literally getting so lucky in this game because that's the second boss already

769
00:59:14,840 --> 00:59:16,840
Okay, oh is he gonna hit me

770
00:59:19,080 --> 00:59:20,840
I don't know

771
00:59:20,840 --> 00:59:22,200
And let me guess

772
00:59:22,200 --> 00:59:27,320
It's gonna try and bounce all the way over there. I don't know. I've just got I've got a small feeling about it

773
00:59:27,400 --> 00:59:31,000
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I got a small feeling about it

774
00:59:33,560 --> 00:59:35,560
It means you get it catch and hauling

775
00:59:36,360 --> 00:59:40,040
Here's hoping we can do 1k damage. I think we've got it before he attacks me

776
00:59:40,520 --> 00:59:43,160
Or does he swallow me whole like that night?

777
00:59:44,200 --> 00:59:46,040
I hope not

778
00:59:46,040 --> 00:59:50,760
I need 1k bro. I need 1k like right now. Does he swallow me whole like a night?

779
00:59:50,760 --> 00:59:52,760
Wait

780
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:57,080
Like I like vor as much as oh, thank gosh. I got an achievement all in all

781
00:59:57,640 --> 00:59:59,640
Defeat the demon wall

782
00:59:59,640 --> 01:00:00,760
What are you?

783
01:00:00,760 --> 01:00:03,480
I look a Rook every nt gains five ball

784
01:00:04,920 --> 01:00:06,760
Every nt gains a ball

785
01:00:06,760 --> 01:00:08,040
Balusion

786
01:00:08,040 --> 01:00:11,800
Balusion provides nt percentage chance to avoid an incoming attack

787
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:15,000
But it's not damage is that

788
01:00:16,840 --> 01:00:18,520
Shuffle

789
01:00:18,600 --> 01:00:21,080
Every six pegs hit when discard. Nah

790
01:00:23,240 --> 01:00:25,800
So we'll upgrade our one orb, I guess

791
01:00:27,320 --> 01:00:29,320
Sure, let's just upgrade our orb

792
01:00:31,160 --> 01:00:33,400
How dare you I fully upgraded it

793
01:00:35,480 --> 01:00:39,000
I mean I feel like we should just stick to our guns and keep it

794
01:00:39,800 --> 01:00:41,800
Are you want the shuffle?

795
01:00:41,960 --> 01:00:46,760
Boss has 500 hp. I need at least 1k damage. Right. I'm not good with math

796
01:00:47,480 --> 01:00:52,360
Should we just the fuck it? Should we just stick to the one orb for the hell of it?

797
01:00:53,880 --> 01:01:00,040
Should we just stick to the one orb? I'm tempted. I would say not put more orbs in honestly. Fuck it one orb

798
01:01:00,040 --> 01:01:02,040
We're gonna one orb this bitch

799
01:01:02,040 --> 01:01:03,080
Leaf

800
01:01:03,080 --> 01:01:08,760
Leaf the rest for later the board will contain 10 additional resets, but each refresh. Oh, no

801
01:01:09,960 --> 01:01:11,960
All attacks have

802
01:01:12,120 --> 01:01:14,120
But every no

803
01:01:14,360 --> 01:01:16,360
All the tax get did it be a one

804
01:01:17,240 --> 01:01:18,280
or

805
01:01:18,280 --> 01:01:19,320
No

806
01:01:19,320 --> 01:01:25,560
All in are replaced with yeah, see that's a good one. Give me the ones. Why doesn't he give me the ones?

807
01:01:25,560 --> 01:01:29,240
You know, there's a difference between and take sealed. Oh shit

808
01:01:32,680 --> 01:01:34,520

977
01:14:42,120 --> 01:14:44,120
Wow, look, you know what you're done

978
01:14:44,360 --> 01:14:49,400
Dr. King. Thank you for the extended membership hedges. This is crucial

979
01:14:50,440 --> 01:14:52,440
Zero we have two crits per word

980
01:14:54,280 --> 01:14:57,800
Dr. King. I'm so sorry. I think you've actually played this game before

981
01:14:58,920 --> 01:15:02,760
I know what you're doing and I'm just like clicking point clicking point

982
01:15:03,880 --> 01:15:09,320
Post battle healing is increased by one percent for each orb in your deck. That's a bit shy

983
01:15:10,040 --> 01:15:14,920
Wall bounces contribute to damage. I'll take that. That's a ball of the good one

984
01:15:17,800 --> 01:15:19,800
Are we doing a I don't want to do

985
01:15:20,760 --> 01:15:26,120
Wait, did I get a relic if I go down here? I think I get a relic if I go down here. Sorry. I'm away

986
01:15:27,320 --> 01:15:29,320
I think we get a relic if we do a mini boss

987
01:15:30,920 --> 01:15:32,360
Oh

988
01:15:32,360 --> 01:15:34,360
Yes, we're going to do the mini boss

989
01:15:35,800 --> 01:15:39,560
Oh, this is straight out of peggle. This board is straight out of peggle

990

Why are my hands my fingers are crossed over as well like I don't know if you see that

993
01:15:55,320 --> 01:15:59,480
Secret about the red bombs in the center if you blow up all the bombs you get another relic

994
01:16:00,440 --> 01:16:02,680
All the bombs in the map are this one here

995
01:16:02,760 --> 01:16:10,280
Is that peg luigi honestly, right toss that bomb

996
01:16:19,560 --> 01:16:25,480
Oh my god, well, I don't think we're going to be struggling with these fights

997
01:16:27,240 --> 01:16:30,520
The fingers are crossed for luck. Oh, that's such a nice little detail

998
01:16:33,080 --> 01:16:37,000
Mini boss is under willman. I mean if I get relic from this, I'm not complaining

999
01:16:38,360 --> 01:16:40,360
Sure, I'll heal

1000
01:16:43,800 --> 01:16:45,800
Well, what are you like

01:16:46,200 --> 01:16:52,360
Grease lightning right immediately deal one damage to the target enemy for every

Activated curious

1003
01:16:54,920 --> 01:17:01,400
Metal mantle aliens rock targeted attacks also hit nearby enemy enemies

Bag of orange pegs

01:17:05,480 --> 01:17:11,080
Attacks get an increase go really fucking chosen making fucking dick jokes

1006
01:17:11,640 --> 01:17:15,080
Attacks get an increase in damage multiplier based on the number of

1007
01:17:16,680 --> 01:17:18,680
What one you want mantle

1008
01:17:19,960 --> 01:17:21,960
It's the rock

1009
01:17:22,920 --> 01:17:26,520
It's the rock red bombs also seem to hurt you unlike normal bombs

1010
01:17:27,480 --> 01:17:31,000
It's the hotline taken mantle goes crazy mantle attack

1011
01:17:33,880 --> 01:17:39,000
Oh my gosh, this game is just so energy. Whoa, are we gonna die here?

1012
01:17:46,200 --> 01:17:48,200
What

1013
01:17:50,120 --> 01:17:53,080
I'm not gonna die because I'm gonna take so much hp damage trying to

1014
01:17:54,040 --> 01:17:56,840
Yeah, that that's why I don't want

Okay, geez

1018

Oh my god, I thought I was gonna die there. I'm not gonna let imagine not dying to the boss but dying to that like stupidity

1019
01:18:21,160 --> 01:18:23,160
I wouldn't put it past me

1020
01:18:23,960 --> 01:18:25,800
I would not put it past me

1021
01:18:25,800 --> 01:18:30,360
You're walking along a section of rail as a rumbling sound grills

1022
01:18:31,640 --> 01:18:36,680
Grows to a roar from behind you you turn just in time to see a loaded

Press X to not die honestly

1027
01:18:55,240 --> 01:18:59,080
I killed the troll but I tripped and fell in love with too much honestly

1028
01:19:00,520 --> 01:19:03,560

1035
01:19:35,320 --> 01:19:40,600
You manage to spring out of the way, but you twist your ankle on the landing. It's not ideal, but you carry on

1036
01:19:40,600 --> 01:19:42,600
Oh

1037
01:19:44,040 --> 01:19:46,040

01:19:54,200 --> 01:19:55,960
Are you

1040
01:19:55,960 --> 01:19:58,360
You encountered a weathered old peglin

1041
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:05,000
Flipping a poker chip through the their nimble fingers. Do you consider yourself a gambler?

1042
01:20:05,640 --> 01:20:07,960
Oh my god, I get I get my gambler after all

1043
01:20:08,120 --> 01:20:15,000
You don't want to lose max hp. That's why you should have done another one. I don't know. Okay. That's true. No, no

1044
01:20:15,160 --> 01:20:18,040
No, you're right. You're correct. I didn't realize it was paramah HP

1045
01:20:18,760 --> 01:20:20,760
A gamble. Let's go gambling

1046
01:20:22,440 --> 01:20:24,440
Invest or gamble gamble

1047
01:20:25,480 --> 01:20:30,760
We could invest we have 150 stonks with coins which we hardly use anyway

1048
01:20:32,600 --> 01:20:34,600
Gamble okay

1049
01:20:35,320 --> 01:20:37,320
Oh

1050
01:20:37,640 --> 01:20:41,800
Bottom slot gain multipliers that double or have your shot on it

1051
01:20:43,080 --> 01:20:45,080
bottom slots

1052
01:20:45,400 --> 01:20:47,640
Gain multipliers that double or have

1053
01:20:48,680 --> 01:20:50,680
Take it

1054
01:20:52,360 --> 01:20:55,880
Take it. I'm not sure about that. Oh, I didn't you see

1055
01:20:57,720 --> 01:20:59,720
More gambler you want me to keep going

1056
01:21:00,680 --> 01:21:04,840
Yeah, I don't like that relic. I don't like it either because it can cut how much damage we do

1057
01:21:06,920 --> 01:21:09,880
The bottom slot's getting okay. Okay, we're gonna skip

1058
01:21:10,760 --> 01:21:15,960
You win the flip the other peglin gives you a rear spin and hands over the chip. Thanks for playing. Wait. I never took the chip

1059
01:21:19,480 --> 01:21:21,480
That was shit, right? I'm not doing that again

1060
01:21:22,120 --> 01:21:29,640
You round the corner and are faced with an eerie life size peglin statue made entirely out of gold

1061
01:21:29,720 --> 01:21:32,040
It's holding a radiant golden orb

1062
01:21:33,640 --> 01:21:34,840
Um

1063
01:21:34,840 --> 01:21:40,440
In its outstretched hand and through though you're wary of the potential risk. You can't help but be tempted by the stat you

1064
01:21:41,560 --> 01:21:43,880
Leave I don't want an orb. Do I?

1065
01:21:44,280 --> 01:21:46,280
I

1066
01:21:46,680 --> 01:21:48,680
Smash the stat you

1067
01:21:49,560 --> 01:21:51,560
Takes 47 damage that ends the run

1068
01:21:53,480 --> 01:21:55,960
I don't I don't need the orb. Do I?

1069
01:21:57,640 --> 01:22:00,760
Oh shit, we're like right before the boss battle and I have nothing

1070
01:22:03,880 --> 01:22:05,880
Back you have wonder

1071
01:22:06,680 --> 01:22:12,920
Post battle upgrade now includes the option to increase your max hp bite. Well, it's a bit late for that. I don't even have that

1072
01:22:14,440 --> 01:22:19,640
Oh my god enemies don't get their extra turns for your first reload

1073
01:22:22,600 --> 01:22:24,600
You have one plus or just

1074
01:22:25,720 --> 01:22:28,440
You have infinite damage multiple open anyway

1075
01:22:29,160 --> 01:22:31,160
Do catalyst catalyst

1076
01:22:32,360 --> 01:22:34,360
catalyst as

1077
01:22:35,400 --> 01:22:39,080
Then decoy for sure you reload a lot got it

1078
01:22:40,040 --> 01:22:43,080
And then I can get another one if we want

1079
01:22:44,040 --> 01:22:46,040
For whatever reason

1080
01:22:47,400 --> 01:22:55,000
So we can't do the discord so what basalt totem post battle upgrade and includes the option to increase

1081
01:22:55,560 --> 01:22:59,560
100% decoy. We won't resolve them. We're fine. The other two don't actually matter

1082
01:23:00,680 --> 01:23:02,680
Oh dang it. Right. Well exit store

1083
01:23:03,880 --> 01:23:06,360
Remove the one orb that is carrying us

1084
01:23:07,400 --> 01:23:10,760
Okay exit store. Thank you very much for your patronage

1085
01:23:11,400 --> 01:23:14,680
Wait, no, I bought this stuff. Thank you very much for your business

1086
01:23:15,560 --> 01:23:16,680
Well

1087
01:23:16,680 --> 01:23:21,720
This is it. This is why we've been playing for the last hour and a half

1088
01:23:22,120 --> 01:23:28,280
I'm sure I'm not gonna mess up with my 38 hp versus

1089
01:23:29,400 --> 01:23:31,720
12,000 h mother fucking

1090

Good luck. Yeah, I'm gonna need all the luck I can get because

1091
01:23:38,440 --> 01:23:40,440
Yeah

1092
01:23:42,680 --> 01:23:45,400
Oh the wall bounces count is damage at least

1093
01:23:46,200 --> 01:23:48,840
What's my vampire attack that gives me heals

1094
01:23:49,880 --> 01:23:53,880
There's something that gives me heals. I think I don't know

1095
01:23:58,440 --> 01:24:00,440
Oh, I don't know

1096
01:24:01,240 --> 01:24:05,000
It's the purple gen that heals me. Okay. Thank god. Right purple gem heals me got it

1097
01:24:05,400 --> 01:24:09,080

300

1099
01:24:12,200 --> 01:24:18,040
Sir, he has 12,000 hp. You're gonna need to whittle it down just a wee bit more than that. Okay

1100
01:24:20,360 --> 01:24:24,200
Please you steal one health for every five pegs hit

1101
01:24:25,320 --> 01:24:27,320
Okay

1102
01:24:29,000 --> 01:24:33,160
It's like giving me so much money. I don't need money. I need damage

1103
01:24:34,040 --> 01:24:38,840
It's gonna one shot me and before it one shots me because I've like got zero defense item

1104
01:24:42,680 --> 01:24:44,040
Yeah

1105
01:24:44,040 --> 01:24:46,040
Oh, we're back up to the

1106
01:24:46,280 --> 01:24:51,640
We're at 500 but that's not even that's not even 10 percent of his full health. Yeah

1107
01:24:54,280 --> 01:24:57,560
Why are you walking towards him? Is he sucking me in?

1108
01:24:57,960 --> 01:25:04,920
Right echo 80 does 500 damage on its own watch this bounce perfectly in there

1109
01:25:07,320 --> 01:25:11,800
Watch him perfectly go near him. Oh, no, it's getting sucked. Oh, well

1110
01:25:13,080 --> 01:25:15,400
I was joking. I was joking

1111
01:25:16,600 --> 01:25:23,400
I'm gonna lose it. You're going with me. Use my mad open here. Right. We're taking down 2k. That's

1112
01:25:23,640 --> 01:25:27,240
Considerable what's echo echo 600, right?

1113
01:25:29,400 --> 01:25:31,400
Hmm, we're needing a reset

1114
01:25:32,200 --> 01:25:34,200
And there is one under here

1115
01:25:34,840 --> 01:25:38,840
I think we have to go for a reset because we've already got two open areas. Yeah, see

1116
01:25:39,640 --> 01:25:41,640
If you could just go in the middle

1117
01:25:42,520 --> 01:25:46,200
Just go in the middle. Yeah, you just stay in the middle doll face. No

1118
01:25:47,880 --> 01:25:50,120
You know exactly what I'm trying to do, right?

1119
01:25:50,680 --> 01:25:52,680
Oh

1120
01:25:53,240 --> 01:25:57,000
I'm scared. I'm scared. Right. Let's hit the reset first

1121
01:26:01,880 --> 01:26:05,400
Oh that I'll take it. I'll take it 700

1122
01:26:14,840 --> 01:26:16,840
Hmm

1123
01:26:17,640 --> 01:26:25,880
Hmm, okay, we're technically one third of a way down his HP

1124
01:26:27,960 --> 01:26:35,000
So I can relax a little bit question mark. I need that six. Is that what he was saying?

1125
01:26:38,120 --> 01:26:40,680
I'm at 32 health 33 health

1126
01:26:41,720 --> 01:26:46,040
35 health. Okay. I'm healing up. I'm healing up. It's not over. It's not over yet

1127
01:26:47,480 --> 01:26:49,480
I believe in the obelisk

1128
01:26:50,440 --> 01:26:52,840
All hail their obelisk overlord

1129
01:26:54,120 --> 01:26:56,120
I believe I believe

1130
01:26:57,320 --> 01:27:00,200
I believe I think I were healing up because we're hitting all the pegels

1131
01:27:04,520 --> 01:27:06,520
I believe I have faith

1132
01:27:07,240 --> 01:27:09,160
truly

1133
01:27:09,160 --> 01:27:12,920
Truly even though we got trolled in that other map where it kept going down in the hole

1134
01:27:13,480 --> 01:27:18,680
Obelisk bros rise up. We have faith in our skinny

1135
01:27:20,200 --> 01:27:23,720
Uh long figurine like overlords

1136
01:27:25,640 --> 01:27:30,920
Like we're still going we've got a thousand we've not bet our record of 1.7

1137
01:27:33,240 --> 01:27:36,280
We may get a 1.4 on the way down 1.4

1138
01:27:37,480 --> 01:27:42,200
1.5 on the way out. Oh not 1.5. I'll take it though

1139
01:27:43,880 --> 01:27:45,080
Oh

1140
01:27:45,080 --> 01:27:50,360
Okay, okay. We've been pushed back so that gives us time to do stuff and things

1141
01:27:51,880 --> 01:27:58,280
We're at 25 health 26. We're back up to 26 27. I'll take it gorgeous 20

1142
01:27:58,600 --> 01:28:00,600
Can I get 28 right 28 health?

1143
01:28:01,240 --> 01:28:05,000
Gorgeous. We're building that health back up every time that pegels peggling

1144
01:28:05,960 --> 01:28:07,960
Uh

1145
01:28:08,120 --> 01:28:16,600
It gives us much more time to heal exactly. We're at 7k. So we're about to be halfway at the 6k damage

1146
01:28:16,600 --> 01:28:21,160
What is our echo echo is one thousand dot point 1.1

1147
01:28:22,600 --> 01:28:24,600
Obelisk bros

1148
01:28:24,760 --> 01:28:30,680
Stonks are very high right now. We might be our record of damage in one round 1.5

1149
01:28:31,320 --> 01:28:34,920
We may get 1.6. Can we get 1.6?

1150
01:28:37,000 --> 01:28:39,160
Right we're 1.6. Can we get 1.7?

1151
01:28:40,440 --> 01:28:42,440
A 1.7

1152
01:28:42,440 --> 01:28:45,400
I'm at 37 health as well. We healed up

1153
01:28:47,240 --> 01:28:53,720
Okay at 1.7 right officially beating our record for damage as well with 1.7 on the boss fight if I do say so myself

1154
01:28:53,800 --> 01:29:01,880
Okay, but imagine if you hit this this repeat right here and then did like

1155
01:29:04,520 --> 01:29:12,120
Called it called it 1.8 1.9 highest damage of 1.9 in a round

1156
01:29:15,080 --> 01:29:19,720
Okay, and we're blocked off from being sucked in feels good man 5k

1157
01:29:20,680 --> 01:29:24,920
Actually pre-recorded stream confirmed and true via video game

1158
01:29:26,440 --> 01:29:29,800
Yeah, we're gonna need a few repeats or we're gonna be in trouble

1159
01:29:31,400 --> 01:29:33,400
1.5

1160
01:29:33,400 --> 01:29:35,080
3k

1161
01:29:35,080 --> 01:29:39,080
What's that in a percentage one fucking one fourth of his health left?

1162
01:29:41,560 --> 01:29:46,760
Unfortunately I'm in a bit of trouble when it comes to the repeat

1163
01:29:47,480 --> 01:29:54,760
Hopefully we don't need a repeat. I mean I'm full health not to jinx it if he gets a critical on us. It might be jover, but

1164
01:29:57,000 --> 01:29:58,520
But

1165
01:29:58,520 --> 01:30:00,520
But but

1166
01:30:00,920 --> 01:30:02,920
This might be it

1167
01:30:03,080 --> 01:30:08,440
This might be the last one and we are unironically won our first go at peggling

1168
01:30:09,480 --> 01:30:11,480
There's no way we're gonna

1169
01:30:17,160 --> 01:30:23,880
Are we actually gonna do it like first try there's no way I don't believe it

1170
01:30:25,960 --> 01:30:27,960
No way first try

1171
01:30:34,760 --> 01:30:36,760
No way

1172
01:30:38,280 --> 01:30:40,280

01:31:17,880 --> 01:31:21,000
But wasn't it not the obelisk that gave us that?

1181
01:31:23,000 --> 01:31:25,000
Oral boros

1182
01:31:25,160 --> 01:31:27,160
That's not an obelisk. Is it?

1183
01:31:27,880 --> 01:31:29,880

It's a lady. Actually, this one looks like more like a lady. This one looks like one with a mohawk

1195
01:32:29,720 --> 01:32:38,520

I can't believe I never even knew anything about it either until it got released. This is the official release. I believe

1236
01:35:45,000 --> 01:35:48,920
um, yumi told us that the game was

1237
01:35:50,200 --> 01:35:52,200
early access

1238
01:35:52,200 --> 01:35:58,280
Which is so one congrats for getting out of early access not many steam games get out of it

1239
01:35:58,680 --> 01:36:01,720
But I love this. I love this

01:36:02,680 --> 01:36:05,240
I love it. This is an interesting game name

1241
01:36:06,280 --> 01:36:09,960
What's wrong with pekelin? What are you nervous? You don't want it?

1242
01:36:11,000 --> 01:36:14,040
What makes you so nervous about the word?

1243
01:36:14,680 --> 01:36:16,680
Peglin

1244
01:36:17,800 --> 01:36:19,800
Why are you so nervous?

1245
01:36:20,280 --> 01:36:22,680
Why are you worried that i'm gonna turn around and see?

1246
01:36:23,720 --> 01:36:25,720
It's pekelin time

1247

1257
01:37:11,560 --> 01:37:18,920
I'm very happy with my purchase. I have to admit 20 us dollars is a wee bit steep in my humble opinion

1258
01:37:19,000 --> 01:37:23,160
However, now that I understand the contents of your game forgive me

1259
01:37:23,800 --> 01:37:31,320

My favorite moment in peggling was when the peg went it's peggling time

1264
01:37:53,000 --> 01:37:55,000
This is a pre-recorded liquid burp

1265

Please understand. I will be playing it playing. I will be making that hypno stream

1273
01:38:27,960 --> 01:38:33,960
Please don't worry that hypno stream isn't cancelled. It's just delayed because I don't have any writers spanking me right now

1274
01:38:34,520 --> 01:38:36,520
because I need to

1275
01:38:37,000 --> 01:38:44,040
Fix a bunch of scripts and then I need to go through the applications on who wants to be a script writer

1276
01:38:44,440 --> 01:38:49,480
I think we're going to try and get three script writers. Um, what if I'm not covered? What if I want mummy?

You can't what I mean, right?

1293
01:39:44,600 --> 01:39:46,600
Okay

1294
01:39:46,760 --> 01:39:51,480
Just I need to deal with that today. So I didn't expect to have to deal with it

1295
01:39:51,560 --> 01:39:56,040
So my plans kind of got a bit shimmied up. So I don't I can't write the hypnosis

1296
01:39:56,120 --> 01:39:58,200
But the hypnosis stream is coming

1297
01:39:58,760 --> 01:40:06,520
Um, I'm also waking up early so I can start recording ASMR. So I'm going to record the hypno stuff as well from those live streams. Um

1298
01:40:09,160 --> 01:40:09,960
Um

1299
01:40:09,960 --> 01:40:11,240
But yes

1300
01:40:11,240 --> 01:40:13,240
So be as the gen is possible can

1301
01:40:14,200 --> 01:40:20,760
No, I can that no no, I can that now. Yeah, you can it you can what can mean

1302
01:40:21,720 --> 01:40:25,080
Um, never go feel DJ. Please go feel DJ

1303
01:40:25,720 --> 01:40:28,600
The tentacle were hurt after a couple of paragraphs

1304
01:40:29,160 --> 01:40:32,920
Well, so people think like, oh, how are you not always like

1305
01:40:34,920 --> 01:40:40,520
I assure you when you're on the other side and it becomes like a job work you get paid for it, etc

1306
01:40:40,920 --> 01:40:44,600
You do not be a tune up. You do not be standing

1307
01:40:45,240 --> 01:40:47,240
tentacle all the time

1308
01:40:47,640 --> 01:40:49,640
It it gets a bit

1309
01:40:50,040 --> 01:40:55,400
It gets monotonous, which is why I like writing it with you because it's completely different

1310
01:40:55,400 --> 01:40:58,680
Like when we do a membership stream together and we like write the next plot

1311
01:40:59,160 --> 01:41:04,120
The reason why it brings me so much satisfaction. It's not boring. I'm not guessing what you want to hear

1312
01:41:04,120 --> 01:41:08,280
I'm having the time of my life, but it gets monotonous fast. So I'm just telling you know, I'm warning, you know

1313
01:41:09,000 --> 01:41:11,000
If you're being serious, okay

1314
01:41:11,880 --> 01:41:17,800
Um, but yes, I'm going to redirect into she be and she's going to be up in two hours

1315
01:41:18,040 --> 01:41:22,760
I'm going to be take five minutes and then I'm going to prepare for an overwatch membership stream

1316
01:41:22,760 --> 01:41:25,640
If you'd like to join in on the shenanigans for that. Don't worry if you can't

1317
01:41:26,440 --> 01:41:30,120
Tomorrow I am playing subnautica for the first time

1318
01:41:30,760 --> 01:41:32,920
um, I am going to be having

1319
01:41:33,640 --> 01:41:37,480
a heart rate monitor on because all he is are like

1320
01:41:39,800 --> 01:41:41,800
It's a horror game and I'm like

1321
01:41:41,800 --> 01:41:46,760
Well, there's no one but I've never played it. So I'm going to have my heart rate monitor on so you can see that for the first time

1322
01:41:47,480 --> 01:41:49,080
um

1323
01:41:49,080 --> 01:41:51,880
I'll be interested to see how subnautica is

1324
01:41:52,440 --> 01:41:59,080
Um, and I will also show you my schedule for next week. Uh in that stream tomorrow. So I can't wait to see you then

1325
01:42:00,520 --> 01:42:06,520
Um, I hope game 2 is the like billy bus stop soon when the full game comes up. I'm so excited for subnautica

1326
01:42:07,000 --> 01:42:13,000
She's deep diving for them booty. Is that a horror game? I don't know, but I'm putting my heart rate monitor on because apparently it's scary

1327
01:42:13,960 --> 01:42:15,960
It's scary

1328
01:42:15,960 --> 01:42:19,080
And I don't want to be scared. Oh crap. I uninsult overwatch

1329
01:42:20,360 --> 01:42:25,640
Well, that's what you get for being hasty. Imagine listening to how much fun I had on overwatch and then you went

1330
01:42:26,120 --> 01:42:28,120
I'm gonna get rid of uh, excuse you

1331
01:42:30,040 --> 01:42:33,720
Excuse you imagine listening to the shagagigans

1332
01:42:33,720 --> 01:42:37,880
We got up to in that overwatch stream and you went nah, there's any way she doesn't want to do this

1333
01:42:38,120 --> 01:42:40,680
Also, fucking free falling shadow

1334
01:42:41,400 --> 01:42:48,920
Who the piss who the actual piss fucking suspended fallen shadow for 30 days release her now

1335
01:42:49,800 --> 01:42:51,800
Release fallen shadow now

1336
01:42:53,400 --> 01:42:55,400
And and you

1337
01:42:55,400 --> 01:43:01,400
Strongies made the bad choice of putting them on youtube. She'll fuck up both platforms. They're as bad as each other

1338
01:43:06,840 --> 01:43:09,080
You have to pick the lesser from two evils

1339
01:43:09,800 --> 01:43:16,280
Well, actually shawndo gets banned for 30 days for what having a wee drink and making a wee joke like excuse fucking her jesus

1340
01:43:17,720 --> 01:43:19,800
Mmm

1341
01:43:19,800 --> 01:43:25,000
Ready for marvels rivals. I'm so excited for it. I want to play deadlock as well

1342
01:43:25,080 --> 01:43:30,600
But apparently I need an invite invite to play invoice. No, please do not invoice me for deadlock

1343
01:43:31,000 --> 01:43:33,000
Um, I need to frickin

1344
01:43:33,800 --> 01:43:35,800
Get an invite or hold on a minute for

1345
01:43:39,640 --> 01:43:41,640
That was a good one. Um

1346
01:43:43,560 --> 01:43:48,280
Uh, apparently deadlock and rivals. I want to do that buzzing bun. Thank you for the tip. Um

1347
01:43:49,640 --> 01:43:55,160
Some hate or admin over exaggerated response that we joke honestly. I heard nothing. Yeah, and it's gonna stay that way

1348
01:43:57,080 --> 01:43:59,080
Um

1349
01:44:00,600 --> 01:44:02,360
Bro

1350
01:44:02,360 --> 01:44:05,880
Um, but yeah marvel rivals look so good. I don't know when it comes out

1351
01:44:05,960 --> 01:44:09,320
I thought I was in beta and I think deadlock's in beta as well. Um

1352
01:44:10,360 --> 01:44:11,960
Shawnee wait until you

1353
01:44:11,960 --> 01:44:16,200
See something in subnautica. You will see how much of a horror game is. I have no idea

1354
01:44:16,680 --> 01:44:20,440
Not clue. I'm playing it for the first time. So we'll find out when we find out

1355
01:44:21,720 --> 01:44:23,720
2025 geez

1356
01:44:23,880 --> 01:44:25,880
Shando shawndo ban

1357
01:44:26,600 --> 01:44:32,440
Not from not thought to this is it. Oh, did you well it was a gag order on both parties

1358
01:44:32,520 --> 01:44:38,120
That's why nothing came out for years and then I don't know how much shit that x employee yet twitches in

1359
01:44:38,760 --> 01:44:42,920
For doing that. I feel like he's probably getting sued into oblivion because you know a miracle

1360
01:44:44,200 --> 01:44:45,480
miracle

1361
01:44:45,480 --> 01:44:47,480
Yeah

1362
01:44:47,480 --> 01:44:49,480
um

1363
01:44:49,640 --> 01:44:52,760
Regarding deadlock. I'm sure there are brief ones that can probably invite you into it

1364
01:44:52,840 --> 01:44:57,000
There's no limit on how many people you can invite just make a fucking open server thing

1365
01:44:57,000 --> 01:44:59,000
And

1366
01:44:59,160 --> 01:45:02,840
Just make it because I don't want to give anyone brain worms being like oh this one reflin gave

1367
01:45:03,240 --> 01:45:08,440
Shawnee deadlock invite and then that's it and I'm like, no, I just want to play deadlock. I've never played it before

1368
01:45:10,200 --> 01:45:14,200
That's right. I'm shadow boxing your brain worms for you before they even develop

1369
01:45:17,720 --> 01:45:23,880
Like I'm beating up. I'm shadow boxing then brain worms before they even formulate. You're welcome. I'm such a

1370
01:45:27,960 --> 01:45:29,800
Um

1371
01:45:29,800 --> 01:45:34,040
Right, as I said, I'm going to redirect into sheepsters is collab in two hours

1372
01:45:34,440 --> 01:45:39,800
Don't be shy to lurk in the shadows. Apparently it's a really easy game to collab with

1373
01:45:40,520 --> 01:45:43,960
Um, so there's a few familiar faces in it all around me

1374
01:45:47,240 --> 01:45:49,240
Worn out places

1375
01:45:49,240 --> 01:45:51,240
Um

1376
01:45:52,920 --> 01:45:57,400
Shawnee telling them brain worms you're already dead before they can come alive

1377
01:45:57,480 --> 01:46:02,680
Honestly, just need to get home from work and I'll be ready to stream snipe. Yes, uh, I'll be playing for a hot second

1378
01:46:02,680 --> 01:46:04,120
So don't worry about it too much

1379
01:46:04,120 --> 01:46:09,000
Right, I'm going to end stream and redirect into sheepsters do see her collab in two hours

1380
01:46:09,000 --> 01:46:11,080
But we're going to redirect into her anyway. Um

1381
01:46:11,720 --> 01:46:16,200
After the overwatch shenanigans, I'm going to go make a cup of tea and get some food in my tummy

1382
01:46:16,280 --> 01:46:19,880
So I'll be five minutes before I pop up. Okay, and I'll give you a kiss

1383
01:46:20,520 --> 01:46:21,400

01:46:23,400 --> 01:46:26,760
I'll give you kisses for how many things we did

1386
01:46:27,960 --> 01:46:36,040
Oh, can you see that? Okay. One two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve, right 12 plus 12 is 24

1387
01:46:36,440 --> 01:46:38,440

1388
01:46:39,960 --> 01:46:41,960
37 38

1389
01:46:41,960 --> 01:46:43,960

I've already lost count. What's it 33

1392
01:47:07,880 --> 01:47:09,880

1402
01:47:49,080 --> 01:47:52,840
And I'm just really blown away by the death team. I think they've done fantastic and I love them
