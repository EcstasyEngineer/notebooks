goes no you're not I'm not what are you streaming to

01:20.960 --> 01:27.720

01:27.720 --> 01:34.080
taking time maybe it's taking time it's taking time oh you may have latency on

01:34.080 --> 01:40.480
by accident hmm I'm on Azura stream but it doesn't say she's there but she's

01:40.480 --> 01:46.680
live streaming though it says it's set for an hour yes every support I asked

01:46.680 --> 01:50.400
Azura very kindly if she could give me one hour earlier and she said yes and

01:50.400 --> 01:54.760
then we both realized 15 minutes before we were gonna go live that we don't

01:54.760 --> 02:00.360
actually have the game downloaded so thank you for the game being tiny and we

02:00.360 --> 02:08.800

11:57.160 --> 12:03.720
have a code phrase between the eyes over between the eyes what's that I think

12:03.720 --> 12:09.000
it's a hint for what you're to do something between the eyes over she's

12:09.000 --> 12:13.560
so cute I love her so much I was like all we're gonna breeze through this game

12:13.560 --> 12:17.680
don't worry I played it before I don't want to tell her what to do though I

12:17.680 --> 12:23.040
found symbols on a wall okay perfect tell me what these symbols are over I

12:23.240 --> 12:31.160
think this is the first one if I'm not mistaken yeah there's three there's

12:31.160 --> 12:40.240
three rows and at the top three it's the first time was like a circle with with

12:40.240 --> 12:49.240
a with the X across it and then one going in the middle okay Roger over

12:49.440 --> 12:57.600
huh so I have identified the symbol but I need a symbol along with that either an

12:57.600 --> 13:04.760
eye color pupil or a second shape over I love try hard in the video games what

13:04.760 --> 13:11.080
eye color pupils eye color pupil I have a green eye potentially a blue eye or a

13:11.120 --> 13:27.520
red eye over I have a red eye and a green eye red eye and a green eye do you

13:27.520 --> 13:33.920
need us can you touch symbols in a wall over I think I remember this one I'm

13:33.920 --> 13:51.280
cheating so much and you have a red left eye and a right green eye over I've

13:51.280 --> 13:56.600
just caught up her comes can you repeat that over is this where we find out

13:57.280 --> 14:06.600
can you repeat your last communication over a left red eye and a right green eye

14:06.600 --> 14:12.680
over okay symbols are someone having diarrhea and then the next symbol to

14:12.680 --> 14:19.080
touch is a circle with a cross and a line straight down over

14:19.080 --> 14:32.680
oh come on tell me that's not a bot with someone having diarrhea straight over she's

14:32.680 --> 14:45.280
talking but she's talking for red left and right green the first symbol is diarrhea a

14:45.280 --> 14:48.400
little but with diarrhea straight up line going down it and then the second

14:48.440 --> 14:59.760
symbol is an X a circle and a line going down over I thought it was a fancy tea like

14:59.760 --> 15:04.160
an oh maybe maybe an upside down umbrella might help her a bit better none of

15:04.160 --> 15:08.280
these look like diarrhea though other than that one

15:08.840 --> 15:15.760
little diarrhea can't it couldn't be me I'm constipated again I don't think you

15:15.840 --> 15:24.560
can click them all at once though only one at a time if so the diarrhea symbol or the

15:24.560 --> 15:34.280
upside down umbrella like it got blown in the wind is your first symbol I click that and then

15:34.280 --> 15:39.680
for your second symbol is a circle with a line down and an X through it over

15:46.320 --> 15:48.880

in the room I don't want to tell her there's an enemy in the room with her if you could just

16:38.560 --> 16:43.280

24:31.200 --> 24:38.880
I have entered the gate on the wall in blood it says bring down the

24:38.960 --> 24:47.120

25:12.560 --> 25:17.920
yes from the white gate as you enter go north into a wall and then east into a wall

25:25.120 --> 25:26.000
okay so this way

25:28.880 --> 25:37.360
I think means on a timer if I'm not okay I'm at a I'm at a wall where there's a dog in Campbell

25:37.360 --> 25:43.200
yes um go north and then east then north is that blue gate open or locked

25:45.280 --> 25:50.400

25:50.400 --> 25:57.600
oh I can't go east there's nothing there oh sorry west west sorry it was north and then west over

25:59.440 --> 26:06.720
she should be here are you at a blue gate over it is open the blue gate is open okay

26:08.320 --> 26:14.640
fuck um I need you to go north past the blue gate

26:18.320 --> 26:27.280
and and then take east but take the first west as you go east so she's gonna be here

26:28.880 --> 26:29.920

yeah uh can you give me a a gate color or something

26:59.760 --> 27:05.680
I've balled this up I think I balled this up what gate what did I do so if she goes here

27:06.480 --> 27:11.360
she could close that green which closes that off and then she's locked in here so it can't be that

27:11.360 --> 27:16.880
she has to go back and open up this blue and then what go up here and then close that and then she

27:16.880 --> 27:24.720
can walk do that and then she can go in here do that which will lock that but then she can go

27:25.600 --> 27:32.000
all the way back and then close and then in and then open and in okay uh where are you Azura on

27:32.000 --> 27:42.800
any gate color the blue one okay can you go back to the white gate over hold on no it's blue

27:43.600 --> 27:46.800

27:46.960 --> 27:51.120
oh do you need I can tell you where to go

27:53.680 --> 27:55.600
if you're at the blue gate go south

27:59.600 --> 28:03.440
okay I'm back at the beginning okay right let's try that again

28:03.440 --> 28:07.520
please go northeast and then enter the room to the right

28:07.920 --> 28:15.040
this is a good puzzle I like this one honestly

28:15.040 --> 28:19.440
there's a hallway here and yes in the room there we have blue lever

28:22.560 --> 28:26.720
there's also a jump scare in this blue corridor here that she has no idea about

28:26.720 --> 28:29.120
I wonder if she's gonna spot it or if she's gonna be too late

28:29.520 --> 28:34.720
have you pulled a blue lever over

28:37.040 --> 28:44.160

go west I'm just gonna go here and that was my throat if you heard that there you go a little

28:52.240 --> 29:00.640
burp for your reefing okay I went west okay now you should be able to go north

29:02.560 --> 29:06.240
she should see the jump scare up here if I'm not mistaken but maybe she was too late

29:13.600 --> 29:19.840
wait what's on the floor wait wait wait there's something there with you

29:23.200 --> 29:27.840

I'm just watching her model to see what she does

32:00.160 --> 32:05.120

first room that you come across going backwards over we'll have to tease and bully mummy in the

34:06.080 --> 34:11.680
future stream to avenge Azura well Azura admitted to me she was trolling me in the among us collab

34:11.680 --> 34:15.520
because she said she liked my Scottish accent coming out and she said when I'm angry it comes out

34:15.520 --> 34:23.600
really quickly and I'm like oh I see how it is Azura okay I'll wait for her to pull that lever

34:23.600 --> 34:32.480
I'll wait for her to communicate to me that she should be here is that the blue lever flicked over

34:32.480 --> 34:49.440
okay go north and then take a west

34:54.000 --> 34:58.400
this is about to time out I'm gonna very quickly do that and she just needs to go north

34:58.960 --> 35:05.840
and we do love the angry scores Azura is one of us try to get my Scottish readout

35:07.360 --> 35:10.320
take him west and then go north

35:30.000 --> 35:38.800
go past the blue gate over me just casually reminding her there's a slug somewhere in the

35:38.800 --> 35:47.120
building although there is a map that she can get got on oh no it might be me that can get got

35:48.000 --> 35:55.280

no it's just a lantern like it's definitely circles over and then like three three two sticking out of

47:57.120 --> 48:04.720
it on each side looks like the lamp like a lamp like Lumiere from Beauty and the Beast oh okay okay

48:04.720 --> 48:10.640
whoa whoa whoa um is icys head fucking massive for her body

48:13.440 --> 48:17.360
oh is icys head massive over

48:20.560 --> 48:21.920
icys head is

48:25.120 --> 48:34.400
decent these these medium is the hill humongous over oh big head with two arms sticking out

48:34.400 --> 48:41.920
yeah two tiny stick arms for the first symbol body half oval body half oval body I don't think this

48:41.920 --> 48:52.480
was the right one actually for the second symbol um is the hill like really massive over yeah it looks

48:52.480 --> 49:01.280
like a boom a boob no is it skinny I don't know what these books I can't remember what the freaking

49:01.280 --> 49:07.680
book stage was well these books are so similar to what she's explaining it could be this one

49:07.680 --> 49:13.760
um no it can't be that one because she said the last one's like a boat no it can't be that one either

49:16.160 --> 49:19.440
um can you input these symbols anywhere like uh

49:22.240 --> 49:24.240
I don't know what she needs me to do uh

49:24.480 --> 49:26.480
uh

49:28.000 --> 49:36.480
is it maybe down here that's the secret adrenaline is pumped okay so I walked onto a platform and

49:36.480 --> 49:44.080
it murdered me oh um

49:47.040 --> 49:52.080
okay I'm just I'm just trying to investigate what I can do for you

49:54.400 --> 50:00.000
murdered her I don't have any instructions when I look at these books though there's like

50:01.680 --> 50:08.080
it's just floor spears oh it only lets me give you the symbols I think I

50:09.760 --> 50:16.560
the floor where there are no spear I know what to do okay you need to explain the symbols in

50:16.640 --> 50:20.160
high detail okay did the symbols restart

50:22.320 --> 50:28.560
I'm to look at the back of the book no it's yes the symbols did in fact restart but they

50:28.560 --> 50:35.360
still look similar it's similar they are very similar on my end first one looks the same it's

50:35.360 --> 50:42.000
like a small like oval half oval body with two sticks sticking out like a snow oh you know like

50:42.080 --> 50:51.440
the snowman we the snowman one with the funny face what this one is now a face with the ears

50:51.440 --> 50:59.920
are we different is it a fat necko vtuber yes or no yes that's okay with pointy ears is the next

50:59.920 --> 51:07.360
one a medium pentus that has a little thing in his urethra over at this time with a line going

51:07.440 --> 51:15.120
through the mountain like it's like a scoop that is a pentus and just one singular tip pointing

51:15.120 --> 51:22.000
out that is a pentus pointing out that is a pentus as two big balls is it like a bird's eye view of

51:22.000 --> 51:32.560
the balls there's a guy in a tucuzi still their head is a oval like a flower is it squished over

51:33.520 --> 51:43.520
the the lantern has changed it now has three legs uh-huh yes that's not third leg is there three

51:43.520 --> 51:49.200
diamonds on the tips at the top okay i think i've got the right one for once with with with pointy

51:49.200 --> 51:55.600
with pointy pointy stick at the top yes yes not descending oh even when the sand is at the back

51:56.240 --> 52:02.240
and then a person standing on a boat they have a dress one eyeball with oval head

52:02.240 --> 52:08.320
actually really good was slightly bigger okay for the third symbol is oh she's a little hair on

52:08.320 --> 52:16.800
their head there's no hair on the head just a stick yeah there's one one one little stick one

52:16.800 --> 52:22.880
hair on the head one stick for the third symbol is the head of the man in the jacuzzi quite flat

52:22.880 --> 52:32.320
but still an oval over yeah flat flat and oval right i have the correct thing but you need to

52:32.320 --> 52:42.000
let me read all of it before you start moving okay okay okay now i'm going to read the instructions

52:42.000 --> 52:46.640
out loud do not do them until i've read the full thing and we've figured it out okay because this

52:46.640 --> 52:59.440
will keep resetting if we muck up in the western corner lies your start keep moving north but watch

52:59.440 --> 53:08.000
your step before the last tile you must head east after those these two steps take one step towards

53:08.000 --> 53:14.000
the south head for the eastern wall then you may proceed towards the door over so that

53:14.640 --> 53:23.440
so just so you comprehend we have to follow these steps in order over okay oh yeah okay yeah yeah

53:23.440 --> 53:31.440
yeah she has no fucking clue that's okay i love her okay and the western hemisphere is where you start

53:31.440 --> 53:41.440
so the first but don't stand on it okay just where you start okay she did she's talking but she's not

53:42.000 --> 53:48.560
talking at the very end yeah like to the left the west is where you start but don't stand on it okay

53:52.720 --> 53:57.760
okay is she okay i'm ready to stream snap okay i'm here

54:00.480 --> 54:08.160
but before the last tile you must head east wait how far east after these two okay i'm ready

54:08.240 --> 54:16.320
okay you are going to start going forwards but before the very last tile you must stop

54:16.320 --> 54:20.880
do not go on the last tile go on the second last tile north if that makes sense okay

54:23.120 --> 54:29.920
surely happy she's a happy happy are you on it yeah kind of over

54:29.920 --> 54:41.760
i'm there okay you must now go all the way east okay over

54:44.240 --> 54:47.280
copy i've seen copy not happy

54:51.520 --> 54:55.680
you must head east oh i meant east just by one tile oops

54:56.320 --> 55:02.880
i'm sorry ray let's try again let's try again are the symbols the same or different

55:03.840 --> 55:09.440
heaps head east one of course they didn't say head east multiple oh luckily they're the same

55:09.440 --> 55:15.360
oh is it the exact same i mean she ain't gonna complain if it's the exact same

55:16.240 --> 55:22.240
lucky okay let's try that again but this time i will not fill it up tea

55:22.800 --> 55:25.760
are you ready

55:28.000 --> 55:32.160
i'm ready on the most western corner is where you start

55:34.560 --> 55:40.720
i'm here go north but stop on the like second last one

55:40.720 --> 55:50.240
before the last gun now go east once

55:54.480 --> 56:01.360
gun take one step towards the south head for the eastern wall then you may proceed to the door

56:02.160 --> 56:07.360
take one step towards the south over

56:10.800 --> 56:21.200
i lied after these two steps one take one step towards the south did you go south or north

56:24.480 --> 56:27.600
you said south that's what the book says

56:30.000 --> 56:37.520
what do you say the book says after these two steps oh two steps as in physically two steps bro

56:37.760 --> 56:45.360
oh she went south oh my god i think it means two steps east brah i got played by english

56:46.960 --> 56:53.040
brah okay let's try that again brah i literally got played by english i hate the english language

56:53.040 --> 57:01.280
so much so what's the symbol is it the same it's not good it's the same you're very lucky

57:01.280 --> 57:09.440
no way is it actually yeah they're the same i love it here okay western wall let's go

57:13.200 --> 57:21.040
i've killed her so many times now right nothing can chase her you said two steps east right no

57:22.080 --> 57:26.480
right i'm going to read it out to you and then we can use our logic together okay

57:27.040 --> 57:34.960
she's talking but she's not okay right it says in the western corner lies your start so we'll go

57:34.960 --> 57:48.880
there i'm there keep moving north but watch your step before the last tail okay so don't go all the

57:48.880 --> 57:56.080
way north okay she's nodding she's nodding again okay now don't go anywhere read this with me okay

57:57.280 --> 58:08.960
before your last tail you must head east okay so you can go east one you don't die on east one

58:12.080 --> 58:21.680
okay then the book says after these two steps so you can go east twice question mark

58:26.480 --> 58:32.960
so go east one to what she's doing she's i don't know if i should go to that tile i think i died on

58:32.960 --> 58:40.640
the tile twice okay twice i just went one more step okay so you've gone east twice technically yes

58:43.280 --> 58:50.640
if i step on this child wait wait wait i died on this don't go don't go don't go don't go don't go

58:50.640 --> 58:58.000
don't go don't go oh don't go so from so from the western side you've gone east twice technically

58:58.000 --> 59:08.400
yes yes okay now it says take one step towards the south head to the eastern wall then you may

59:08.400 --> 59:16.240
proceed towards the door so i think you go south once then all the way east and then all the way

59:17.120 --> 59:18.880
that makes sense right over

59:23.440 --> 59:30.800
oh thank god i'm not doing that one again that was shite that's shite being Scottish that was awful

59:31.600 --> 59:37.680
fucking english why did they do english like that brave right i'm going in a okay this is the one

59:37.680 --> 59:44.720
where i can die i can see her model she has no idea what's going on she can hear it though

59:46.800 --> 59:53.120
there's a show and i'm being hunted and she has no idea i'm just gonna let her have fun

59:53.120 --> 01:00:01.840
she'll figure out she'll figure out it's fine he has to watch them so i am on the other side of the show

01:00:04.800 --> 01:00:11.040
a movie you are going to be pulling out scenes for me to watch

01:00:11.040 --> 01:00:16.640
uh uh uh

01:00:19.360 --> 01:00:23.200
um there should be a narration lever if i'm not mistaken

01:00:25.280 --> 01:00:30.560
there's gonna be a monster right behind me isn't there oh it's not there yet well he comes up soon

01:00:31.440 --> 01:00:32.720
there's a couple of lovers

01:00:34.080 --> 01:00:48.080
two levers forbidden for being fooled in a horror puzzle game there's a goat goddess and a kulfish

01:00:48.080 --> 01:00:54.640
and we have room temperature iq and i forget how the rest of the song goes but

01:00:55.600 --> 01:01:05.120
super hard puzzles super hard puzzles they're really difficult because they're super super super

01:01:05.120 --> 01:01:13.520
hard puzzles as they will get revenge there's the enemies sneaking up on me do you have a narration

01:01:13.520 --> 01:01:22.480
lever what's what's that what's in a what a lever it's a lever that literally has narration on it

01:01:22.480 --> 01:01:29.680
or maybe scene one something like that yeah it's a scene one on it if you pull it i think it gives

01:01:29.680 --> 01:01:37.520
you dialogue scene one or does it give me the dialogue and i'm to tell her what to do with that

01:01:38.560 --> 01:01:41.840
man i wish i could sit in the seats um

01:01:44.560 --> 01:01:47.520
to the left and the right there should be like three levers for her to pull

01:01:48.160 --> 01:01:49.680
how about you just pull everything out

01:01:53.360 --> 01:01:58.800
would you want to pull out a zero i didn't say that to her i was asking the reflings to be honest

01:01:58.800 --> 01:02:03.120
would you pull out of a zero i don't think you would you shouldn't all the girls are designed

01:02:03.120 --> 01:02:10.000
not to be pulled out of uh do you see levers that you can mess with

01:02:10.960 --> 01:02:20.560
yes i do one lever is broken though okay uh pull out of the other levers and i think i will be able

01:02:20.560 --> 01:02:21.440
to see what you're doing

01:02:26.160 --> 01:02:33.120
whoa Poseidon you didn't have to do that you goofy goober thank you for the redirect Poseidon

01:02:33.120 --> 01:02:38.800

01:02:49.680 --> 01:02:55.040
playing more tcg like an absolute chad um i don't see anything happening on my end

01:02:57.440 --> 01:03:06.960
oh hold on a minute i'm a brain lit hold on pause jump okay what's this okay i'm an idiot

01:03:07.440 --> 01:03:09.120
oh there it is

01:03:12.640 --> 01:03:14.960

01:03:17.520 --> 01:03:22.560
well i'm glad dessert didn't see this she would freak out bye okay what does that mean why is

01:03:22.560 --> 01:03:26.960
your creepy music playing uh because i'm being hunted right now but don't worry that's for me

01:03:26.960 --> 01:03:34.320
to worry about you just do a castle filled with life okay wait how am i supposed to do that what

01:03:34.320 --> 01:03:40.480
what do you mean you're being hunted it's fine it's fine i'm willing to die for you just pull a lever

01:03:41.600 --> 01:03:47.120
and make a castle full of life that's what that's what you've been given but hi uh Poseidon readers

01:03:47.120 --> 01:03:53.360
i'm strony calls from vlr the thought agency um Poseidon's awesome by the way if you didn't know

01:03:53.360 --> 01:03:58.400

01:04:05.280 --> 01:04:10.960
getting hunted right now i think she would freak out seeing this if i'm being honest it's probably

01:04:10.960 --> 01:04:16.560
better in the end i did this side because i think is there would have a heart attack if she saw that

01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:24.480
no guess we go low and i is a little puppeteer type thing i saw Poseidon's yeah Poseidon got a

01:04:24.480 --> 01:04:33.280
2.0 model recently i don't know if Azura knows what she better stop jingling a lingon

01:04:35.520 --> 01:04:37.920
wait why oh that like kills my pov

01:04:39.600 --> 01:04:43.840
can i like die if i get too close oh i won't let me actually get closer to him that's quite

01:04:43.840 --> 01:04:50.080
interesting it blocks me from getting closer it's definitely a marionette i do like creepy creepy

01:04:50.080 --> 01:04:59.440
marionette vtuber confirmed why am i supposed to do i don't know what to do um so you are sending out

01:04:59.440 --> 01:05:07.760
a play um and the cardboard cutouts are like a king a queen a castle the people and your prompt is

01:05:07.760 --> 01:05:16.320
there was a castle full of life there is a castle but there's only there's only

01:05:20.240 --> 01:05:21.120
i'm so dead

01:05:24.080 --> 01:05:27.840
i'm so dead but yes Poseidon got a 2.0 model if you didn't see it it was a

01:05:27.840 --> 01:05:32.080
that's very big not blood light not yet that's later

01:05:32.160 --> 01:05:38.320
can she not find all the six levers there's six levers there might be levers on the opposite

01:05:38.320 --> 01:05:44.400
side of the room i am so dead it's fine

01:05:44.960 --> 01:05:56.720
oh that was wrong well i didn't like that wherever that was

01:06:04.080 --> 01:06:09.600
it's okay it's okay i suck at video games i die in them all the time it's fine um

01:06:09.680 --> 01:06:13.280
um right there once was a castle full of life

01:06:18.240 --> 01:06:19.280
he got closer

01:06:23.600 --> 01:06:26.720
thank god i played this game before because i'm not gonna lie this is really creepy the first

01:06:26.720 --> 01:06:35.680
time you play there at the hotel or just pill stuff um just pill stuff all the way out if you can

01:06:35.680 --> 01:06:40.880
like a castle a king a queen and a crowed i'm just straight up telling her what i remember

01:06:40.880 --> 01:06:43.520
from the gameplay i think that's what she has to do right now

01:06:51.600 --> 01:06:54.960
these they're like in separate rooms oh

01:06:57.360 --> 01:07:02.960
she's just discovered the other ones she's just discovered the other one she's so cute i love her

01:07:05.760 --> 01:07:11.440
i will embrace sweet death the eternal slumber in the name of the yetpricorn

01:07:22.320 --> 01:07:28.560
the blood light is oh i can see what you're pulling out i think keep pulling the handles

01:07:28.720 --> 01:07:35.680
am i being an idiot is that supposed to be watching this entire time i'm me just leaving

01:07:35.680 --> 01:07:50.320
her to do the guesswork what are you doing is this is this the castle um no you've pulled out

01:07:50.320 --> 01:07:52.400
in a marriage arch way it looks like

01:07:56.640 --> 01:08:02.960
i don't see anything else with a castle and except for those have you pulled the things all the way

01:08:02.960 --> 01:08:13.360
out i actually see like half of a king it's ogre it's so ogre they'll have to admit this is probably

01:08:13.360 --> 01:08:16.320
the heart oh you're pulling out people i see people

01:08:21.040 --> 01:08:24.880
i see people but they're not pulled out all the way oh they're going away again

01:08:24.880 --> 01:08:30.720
oh they're coming out again hey hi people okay it was my fault i'm supposed to guide her and

01:08:30.720 --> 01:08:38.400
what to do okay that's yeah yeah that's them all the way out so i've got people in a castle

01:08:38.480 --> 01:08:48.720
oh i can't even i just walk okay i may or may not have been hunted by a monster and i didn't

01:08:48.720 --> 01:08:58.240
want to stress you out i didn't want to stress you out but i was being hunted i was being hunted

01:08:58.240 --> 01:09:05.920

01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:14.560
okay okay this is like the last scene anyway and then we're done i think uh right

01:09:20.720 --> 01:09:22.560
wait my door's locked

01:09:24.960 --> 01:09:30.240

01:09:30.480 --> 01:09:38.480
oh of the door is your door locked as well the spikes yeah oh come on

01:09:40.960 --> 01:09:42.720
the symbols are different this time

01:09:48.560 --> 01:09:54.400
um right hit me with the symbols we have to go back okay i'm gonna read

01:09:54.480 --> 01:10:02.960
ready okay the one is a big head a big icy head laying on a floor

01:10:03.920 --> 01:10:12.080

hidden agenda is okay starting in the far west take two steps northbound head east twice

01:28:23.200 --> 01:28:32.000
then after moving north two times one can head for the door after taking one step towards the

01:28:32.000 --> 01:28:42.560
western wall okay now let's digest this starting in the far west so go to the west side but don't

01:28:42.560 --> 01:28:50.960
stand on it i will cry if she stands on it a little blind but i could not find that one okay

01:28:54.160 --> 01:28:57.200

you what you did it you did it yeah yeah yeah yeah okay okay okay

01:29:27.400 --> 01:29:31.200

That's right, but to come to a fucking walkie-talkie, what the fuck is this?

01:29:57.440 --> 01:30:02.000
Right, one can head for the door after taking one step towards the dead west once.

01:30:06.640 --> 01:30:09.920
There's gonna be more than vibrations coming through this damn walkie-talkie, the fuck?

01:30:14.080 --> 01:30:18.640

one more for the castle. The perfect towns, people, next. Let's speedrun this bitch.

01:30:56.560 --> 01:30:59.920
Push, push, push, push, push, push, push, push, push, push, push, push, push, push, push,

01:30:59.920 --> 01:31:01.920
scene, scene, scene, scene.

01:31:05.600 --> 01:31:09.280
Beautiful, gorgeous, a garden, 10 out of 10.

01:31:09.360 --> 01:31:20.640
I just did that on the mic. Castle King, Queen all the way out, push, push, push,

01:31:22.000 --> 01:31:27.440
she just coughed in her mouth there, like a fucking toddler. Push castle more, castle more,

01:31:29.920 --> 01:31:34.080
more, more, more, until, almost, all the way, all the way, all the way, all the way, all that way.

01:31:34.080 --> 01:31:38.240
One more castle, one more castle, one more king, one more king, one more queen, otmer queen, one more

01:31:38.240 --> 01:31:40.520
King, King, King, King, King, King, King, King, King.

01:31:40.520 --> 01:31:41.560
Okay, scene.

01:31:42.620 --> 01:31:44.760
This must be so confusing on her end.

01:31:47.040 --> 01:31:47.880
Beautiful.

01:31:51.880 --> 01:31:55.480
All were happy and all was good.

01:31:55.480 --> 01:31:59.280
King, Queen, Castle, Townspeople.

01:31:59.280 --> 01:32:01.040
Push, push, push, push.

01:32:01.040 --> 01:32:03.320
I have absolutely no idea if that's the correct one.

01:32:03.320 --> 01:32:05.560
Push, push, push, push the castle.

01:32:05.560 --> 01:32:06.400
Push that castle.

01:32:06.400 --> 01:32:08.000
Teacher, yeah, yeah, teacher who's boss.

01:32:08.000 --> 01:32:08.840
That's right, King next.

01:32:08.840 --> 01:32:09.660
Fuck up that King.

01:32:09.660 --> 01:32:10.500
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:32:10.500 --> 01:32:11.340
That's right, yeah.

01:32:11.340 --> 01:32:12.180
Get that Queen in.

01:32:12.180 --> 01:32:13.000
Get that Queen in.

01:32:13.000 --> 01:32:13.840
Get them Townsfolk in.

01:32:13.840 --> 01:32:14.680
Yeah.

01:32:15.680 --> 01:32:16.520
Is she laughing?

01:32:16.520 --> 01:32:17.840
I think she's laughing.

01:32:17.840 --> 01:32:19.240
Okay, Townspeople, Townspeople.

01:32:19.240 --> 01:32:20.280
Bring them in, bring them in.

01:32:20.280 --> 01:32:23.240
Hey, hey, hey, celebrate with the King and Queen.

01:32:24.520 --> 01:32:25.880
More, more, more, more.

01:32:28.000 --> 01:32:29.720
Show those peasants what they're missing out on.

01:32:29.720 --> 01:32:30.560
Pill that scene.

01:32:30.560 --> 01:32:31.600
Pill that scene.

01:32:35.160 --> 01:32:36.920
Oh my God, we did it.

01:32:36.920 --> 01:32:37.920
We did it.

01:32:37.960 --> 01:32:41.560
King, Queen, that was Castle and Townspeople.

01:32:41.560 --> 01:32:44.600
Okay, now let's find out what's happening in this next scene.

01:32:44.600 --> 01:32:45.440
What's next?

01:32:48.000 --> 01:32:50.640
Until the King killed all he could,

01:32:50.640 --> 01:32:52.200
give me Evil King.

01:32:52.200 --> 01:32:53.360
Put the good King away.

01:32:53.360 --> 01:32:55.720
Boo, put the King away.

01:32:55.720 --> 01:32:56.560
Boo.

01:32:58.760 --> 01:33:00.200
We need Evil King now.

01:33:02.080 --> 01:33:03.720
I don't know which one the King is.

01:33:04.720 --> 01:33:10.160
Yep, perfect, perfect, all the way.

01:33:10.160 --> 01:33:11.000
Get rid of that.

01:33:11.000 --> 01:33:11.840
Boo.

01:33:11.840 --> 01:33:13.840
Right, now we need Evil King out.

01:33:13.840 --> 01:33:16.040
Evil King, Evil King.

01:33:17.040 --> 01:33:18.080
Oh, here he comes.

01:33:18.080 --> 01:33:19.600
Push, push, push him all the way out.

01:33:19.600 --> 01:33:20.800
Perfect, perfect.

01:33:20.800 --> 01:33:22.320
Oh, he's deranged, he's deranged.

01:33:22.320 --> 01:33:24.720
Okay, now we need the bloodlights in the back.

01:33:26.720 --> 01:33:28.360
You piss off, I'm working hard.

01:33:28.360 --> 01:33:30.040
Okay, scene.

01:33:31.040 --> 01:33:35.040
Until the King killed all he could.

01:33:35.040 --> 01:33:35.880
Oh, he's crazy.

01:33:35.880 --> 01:33:36.800
He's absolutely mental.

01:33:36.800 --> 01:33:38.120
He's deranged.

01:33:38.120 --> 01:33:41.120
Standing in blood, he probably said.

01:33:42.600 --> 01:33:46.120
Standing in blood, he proudly said,

01:33:46.120 --> 01:33:50.440
give me Blood King in Castle.

01:33:50.440 --> 01:33:52.640
Maybe Blood King in Light,

01:33:52.640 --> 01:33:55.080
and that's the Evil King in the Bloodlight.

01:33:55.080 --> 01:33:56.440
I think that might be it.

01:33:57.680 --> 01:33:59.280
Everyone away, Bloodlight on.

01:34:00.200 --> 01:34:03.360
Okay, perfect, and Bloodlight on and scene.

01:34:07.040 --> 01:34:09.080
No, no, that's the Bloodlight off, sorry.

01:34:09.080 --> 01:34:10.680
Pop that bad boy back on.

01:34:12.320 --> 01:34:14.120
And then pull scene.

01:34:14.120 --> 01:34:16.320
Shit, you might need to bring out

01:34:16.320 --> 01:34:19.640
the dead townspeople, I don't even know if that's possible.

01:34:19.640 --> 01:34:20.480
He just says.

01:34:23.680 --> 01:34:24.760
I don't think there's dead.

01:34:24.760 --> 01:34:29.000
Oh, oh, oh, sorry, bring out the normal King again.

01:34:29.040 --> 01:34:31.120
He just says standing in blood.

01:34:31.120 --> 01:34:32.720
Maybe one, maybe, can you bring out

01:34:32.720 --> 01:34:33.920
the Evil King any further?

01:34:33.920 --> 01:34:36.600
Sorry, see if you can wind him out any further.

01:34:40.840 --> 01:34:43.760
No, no, okay, maybe put Evil King away

01:34:43.760 --> 01:34:44.960
and bring out normal King,

01:34:44.960 --> 01:34:47.920
because he's just standing in blood, so with a Bloodlight.

01:34:47.920 --> 01:34:49.120
What's the stage four?

01:34:49.120 --> 01:34:51.640
Oh, I'm dying, ho ho ho, hurry up, Azura.

01:34:51.640 --> 01:34:53.720
Hee hee, love you, love you, Mummy, please, sorry,

01:34:53.720 --> 01:34:55.160
please don't let me die.

01:34:55.160 --> 01:34:58.240
Okay, perfect, and then put away Evil King.

01:34:58.240 --> 01:34:59.720
Yeah, yeah, yeah, go away, Evil King.

01:34:59.720 --> 01:35:02.920
You stink, boo, boo, thumbs down.

01:35:02.920 --> 01:35:04.800
Okay, pull scene.

01:35:10.120 --> 01:35:10.960
You did it!

01:35:14.640 --> 01:35:17.960
You did it, go down into the attic thing.

01:35:20.840 --> 01:35:23.600
What the fuck was that noise, God damn.

01:35:23.600 --> 01:35:25.800
Oh my God, that was a painful one I've dead met.

01:35:25.800 --> 01:35:27.760
Hey, see me, hi.

01:35:29.080 --> 01:35:32.760
You still have to talk to me through the walkie-talkie, though.

01:35:34.760 --> 01:35:38.960
Oh my God, oh, your walkie-talkie's just hovering.

01:35:42.720 --> 01:35:47.720
No, Azura, you might be the mother of all creations, okay?

01:35:49.040 --> 01:35:54.040
Of all life on this earth, so it's you who must go on.

01:35:55.040 --> 01:35:59.000
Go ahead, I will stand on the pressure plate

01:35:59.000 --> 01:36:01.640
and you will get freedom that you deserve.

01:36:01.640 --> 01:36:03.720
Your creations need you.

01:36:03.720 --> 01:36:06.000
Go forth, Azura, into the snow.

01:36:08.880 --> 01:36:11.360
What happened in you?

01:36:11.360 --> 01:36:14.800
It is the sacrifice I must make, for I am a siren.

01:36:14.800 --> 01:36:19.560
I take life, but you are the goddess of fertility you give.

01:36:19.560 --> 01:36:22.440
Go on forth to humanity.

01:36:22.960 --> 01:36:24.840
Give them the love they deserve.

01:36:28.280 --> 01:36:29.120
She went.

01:36:29.120 --> 01:36:29.960
No!

01:36:34.400 --> 01:36:35.800
You did it.

01:36:35.800 --> 01:36:38.920
Was there another way, question mark?

01:36:38.920 --> 01:36:42.920
That was amazing, you did it, Azura.

01:36:42.920 --> 01:36:43.880
Hee-hee-hee.

01:36:43.880 --> 01:36:44.720
You did it!

01:36:44.720 --> 01:36:47.880
You did it, that was fantastic, you did so well.

01:36:47.880 --> 01:36:49.960
You were worried about nothing.

01:36:50.960 --> 01:36:53.120
I don't think so.

01:36:53.120 --> 01:36:55.480
It was good, you did fantastic.

01:36:57.480 --> 01:36:59.320
Hee-hee-hee.

01:36:59.320 --> 01:37:01.040
Wait, what did you think?

01:37:01.040 --> 01:37:02.640
What did you think of that game type?

01:37:02.640 --> 01:37:03.640
Yes or no?

01:37:04.920 --> 01:37:07.480
I was, that was hard.

01:37:07.480 --> 01:37:09.680
I'm not good at puzzles at all.

01:37:09.680 --> 01:37:13.600
That, the last one was painful.

01:37:13.600 --> 01:37:16.160
I have to admit, that was really hard to figure out.

01:37:16.160 --> 01:37:18.400
Even, I've played the game before

01:37:18.400 --> 01:37:21.480
and I kind of knew what you were doing on your end

01:37:21.480 --> 01:37:24.120
and I still couldn't figure it out from the other perspective.

01:37:24.120 --> 01:37:26.600
So don't feel dumb, that was hard.

01:37:26.600 --> 01:37:28.000
It was hard as shit.

01:37:28.000 --> 01:37:31.920
I think I should study chessboards more.

01:37:33.400 --> 01:37:36.760
Well, I literally was calling the king, the queen at one point

01:37:36.760 --> 01:37:39.040
and then Refleens were like, that's the king you moron.

01:37:39.040 --> 01:37:41.200
I'm like, oh, okay, okay, I'll deal with it.

01:37:44.200 --> 01:37:46.560
So don't worry about it, don't worry about it.

01:37:46.560 --> 01:37:49.840
But there's like a whole series on the WiiWare here.

01:37:49.840 --> 01:37:53.760
I think there's now four installments of the franchise.

01:37:55.840 --> 01:38:00.280
And for some reason, on the very last installment of this game,

01:38:00.280 --> 01:38:04.400
they made it so unbelievably hard and difficult for no reason.

01:38:05.360 --> 01:38:07.200
And all the other ones?

01:38:07.200 --> 01:38:11.160
Yeah, so I've been lucky enough to play them

01:38:11.160 --> 01:38:14.320
with other VTubers and another life team.

01:38:14.360 --> 01:38:18.480
And the fourth installment is impossible without cheating.

01:38:20.160 --> 01:38:22.960
I refuse to believe anyone naturally came up

01:38:22.960 --> 01:38:24.600
with one of the answers in them.

01:38:24.600 --> 01:38:28.200
But if you ever wanted to give another one a shot,

01:38:28.200 --> 01:38:29.600
I'm right here, Azura.

01:38:31.840 --> 01:38:33.960
But I don't know if puzzles are your thing.

01:38:33.960 --> 01:38:35.240
Well, I don't know if they're your thing.

01:38:35.240 --> 01:38:37.560
They're not my thing, I'm dumb.

01:38:37.560 --> 01:38:40.360
Oh, that's adorable though, I loved it.

01:38:40.360 --> 01:38:43.880
I'm sorry about scaring you about the monster in the maze.

01:38:43.880 --> 01:38:50.320
I'm going to be honest, the monster can't get you in the maze.

01:38:50.320 --> 01:38:52.360
I was just waning you up, I'm sorry.

01:38:56.240 --> 01:38:59.000
That's what you get for waning me up in among us.

01:38:59.000 --> 01:39:01.600
We were talking before the stream and she was like,

01:39:01.600 --> 01:39:04.440
I purposely picked on you to hear that Scottish accent.

01:39:04.440 --> 01:39:08.000
I'm like, Azura, you're not supposed to say that.

01:39:08.000 --> 01:39:09.560
She's like, oh, because I was like,

01:39:09.560 --> 01:39:11.320
oh, I don't get angry or frustrated.

01:39:11.320 --> 01:39:13.680
And she was like, the among us club.

01:39:13.680 --> 01:39:14.520
And I'm like, you know what?

01:39:14.520 --> 01:39:15.720
You've actually got me there.

01:39:15.720 --> 01:39:16.520
I got caught red.

01:39:16.520 --> 01:39:17.640
You caught me.

01:39:17.640 --> 01:39:18.960
You caught me.

01:39:18.960 --> 01:39:21.520
You got me, I'm not going to lie.

01:39:21.520 --> 01:39:23.480
It was funny.

01:39:23.480 --> 01:39:26.960
Or you got so mad, she'd vote me off immediately.

01:39:26.960 --> 01:39:30.440
And then I wasn't even the imposter and then she'd get.

01:39:30.440 --> 01:39:34.160
I always, if someone, if anyone picks on me,

01:39:34.160 --> 01:39:36.040
I'm like, instantly you're the imposter

01:39:36.040 --> 01:39:37.720
because you're worried I'm going to snuff you out.

01:39:37.720 --> 01:39:39.560
And then obviously I think I booted you off once

01:39:39.560 --> 01:39:40.280
and you were innocent.

01:39:40.280 --> 01:39:42.040
And then everyone was like, you're gilly strong.

01:39:42.040 --> 01:39:45.400
And I'm like, no, no, Azura is starting then.

01:39:45.400 --> 01:39:47.520
You started.

01:39:47.520 --> 01:39:49.520
I'm going to end it.

01:39:49.520 --> 01:39:53.400
I was so scared.

01:39:53.400 --> 01:39:54.360
That was so good.

01:39:54.360 --> 01:39:57.040
Thank you so much for playing with me and enjoyed myself

01:39:57.040 --> 01:39:57.540
thoroughly.

01:39:57.540 --> 01:39:59.840
Are you streaming after this or is that

01:39:59.840 --> 01:40:00.840
you done for today?

01:40:00.840 --> 01:40:03.920
Because I don't know if I should be direct into year or not.

01:40:03.920 --> 01:40:04.960
I'm done for today.

01:40:04.960 --> 01:40:07.480
I'm probably just going to chat with my stream for a little bit.

01:40:07.480 --> 01:40:08.240
Yes, OK.

01:40:08.240 --> 01:40:09.600
I say a little bit, but it's probably

01:40:09.600 --> 01:40:12.120
going to be for like two hours.

01:40:12.120 --> 01:40:14.080
They didn't call you yet for calling for nothing

01:40:14.080 --> 01:40:15.360
around these parts.

01:40:15.360 --> 01:40:17.960
OK, let me make sure I'm redirecting into year.

01:40:20.800 --> 01:40:25.920
Because I don't want to not direct into year.

01:40:25.920 --> 01:40:26.920
But that was so fun.

01:40:26.920 --> 01:40:29.040
Please, if you ever wanted to play more of those,

01:40:29.040 --> 01:40:31.680
I enjoy those games totally not because I've played them before

01:40:31.680 --> 01:40:32.680
and they're not impossible.

01:40:32.680 --> 01:40:34.360
Tee, tee.

01:40:34.360 --> 01:40:37.800
If I played them fresh, I'd be a lot more nervous

01:40:37.800 --> 01:40:43.120
because I'm like, um, but I think we did OK.

01:40:43.120 --> 01:40:43.920
I was nervous.

01:40:43.920 --> 01:40:46.600
You were going to get upset that I was so dumb.

01:40:46.600 --> 01:40:48.840
No, I would never get upset at you for no good.

01:40:48.840 --> 01:40:50.040
I mean, like, I was.

01:40:50.040 --> 01:40:52.200
Don't get off the puzzle forever.

01:40:52.200 --> 01:40:52.800
Oh, bro.

01:40:52.800 --> 01:40:54.120
That last puzzle killed us.

01:40:54.120 --> 01:40:55.200
Not going to lie.

01:40:55.200 --> 01:40:56.080
Everything else.

01:40:56.080 --> 01:40:57.560
I don't want this puzzle that I ever.

01:40:57.560 --> 01:40:58.520
We blitzed through.

01:40:58.520 --> 01:41:00.600
The longest puzzle.

01:41:00.600 --> 01:41:02.600
The longest puzzle I've ever gotten stuck on

01:41:02.600 --> 01:41:05.560
was like for literally two days straight.

01:41:05.560 --> 01:41:07.440
And what?

01:41:07.480 --> 01:41:09.760
I'd just cheat at that point.

01:41:09.760 --> 01:41:12.040
It was.

01:41:12.040 --> 01:41:13.840
I don't think you can cheat, though.

01:41:13.840 --> 01:41:16.720
Like, yeah, you can cheat to find out what you have to do.

01:41:16.720 --> 01:41:18.600
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:41:18.600 --> 01:41:21.120
You have to actually time it.

01:41:21.120 --> 01:41:22.520
It was like a timing puzzle.

01:41:22.520 --> 01:41:24.360
And I could never get the timing, right?

01:41:24.360 --> 01:41:27.080
No, I don't like that kind of stuff.

01:41:27.080 --> 01:41:31.760
And apparently there's a game called Labyrinth Co-op Horror Puzzle.

01:41:31.760 --> 01:41:34.000
I'm not sure if I can put the girls up for that.

01:41:34.000 --> 01:41:37.160
I was freaking Azura pretending a slug was going to grab her.

01:41:37.200 --> 01:41:39.440
I don't know how I should respond to a game like that.

01:41:42.440 --> 01:41:43.640
I scream.

01:41:43.640 --> 01:41:44.840
Terrible.

01:41:44.840 --> 01:41:45.640
Right.

01:41:45.640 --> 01:41:48.000
I am going to redirect into Azura,

01:41:48.000 --> 01:41:50.120
because unfortunately I do have a few things to do today.

01:41:50.120 --> 01:41:52.360
And thank you so, so much for playing me.

01:41:52.360 --> 01:41:53.600
That was a hoot and a holler.

01:41:53.600 --> 01:41:54.880
I'm going to redirect into you.

01:41:54.880 --> 01:41:57.480
Reeflings, be lovely to the bleeding hearts.

01:41:57.480 --> 01:41:58.240
I'm bleeding hearts.

01:41:58.240 --> 01:42:01.640
Thanks for having me as well on your end of things, Azura.

01:42:01.640 --> 01:42:02.840
I will redirect into you.

01:42:02.840 --> 01:42:04.000
Thank you so, so much.

01:42:04.000 --> 01:42:05.560
I give everyone kisses.

01:42:06.560 --> 01:42:09.240
And I'm going to dissipate, okay?

01:42:09.240 --> 01:42:10.360
I'm going to dissipate.

01:42:10.360 --> 01:42:11.720
I'm going to jump out of voice chat first,

01:42:11.720 --> 01:42:13.800
because Azura is going to be like, bruh.

01:42:13.800 --> 01:42:16.040
She's going to be like, bruh, what's going on here?

01:42:16.040 --> 01:42:17.040
Okay.

01:42:17.040 --> 01:42:17.880
All right, I take off.

01:42:17.880 --> 01:42:18.720
Bye-bye, guys.

01:42:18.720 --> 01:42:19.760
Bye.

01:42:19.760 --> 01:42:20.760
Bye-bye.

01:42:20.760 --> 01:42:21.760
Bye.

01:42:21.760 --> 01:42:22.760
Bye.
