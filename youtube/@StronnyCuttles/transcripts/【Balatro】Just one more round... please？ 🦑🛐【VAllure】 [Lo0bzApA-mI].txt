catch you YouTube being sloppy and I when I catch you YouTube being sloppy hmm
okay we caught YouTube in 5k it says my condition is now excellent that's what I
thought okay I do apologize for the stream being two hours later but the
best time zone for everyone to come to to come and congregate and it was at my
usual time and this is going to be a bit of a shorter stream because again oh I
can't believe I'm doing work in the background but for those of you who are
signed up to my patreon you got early access to two celebration audios not the
alternative kind I recorded the honey tea script and a couple of hours ago

reason why it says optionals because I don't always put deodorant on 67 of what
the numbers Mason what do they mean the numbers the number allegedly none of us

ended up hanging out for two hours and now I'm here so yeah I did not have time
to speak to my dad yet but my dad is getting here in a week and are we gonna
lose the house I just tuned in we might it's very plausible but we've completed
around with a dude a do-deck a blue deck we're gonna try yellow because it
already gives us such high economy seated run oh I thought it said speed run I
was like sure let's speed run this and but I would tell my dad my dad gets here
in a week so I'm probably just straight up show him that I don't think I said
anything to an appropriate in this room although he doesn't really do shit it

run any like in this thing anyway so I'm actually gonna go next choose to up to

house is straight basically you guys may or may not have walked me through the
game a wild card turn it into a wild card and one minus hand size that's
fine we're going for it yeah I saw you like some comments I was like yes I also

wait one oh one two three four we're shy of a flush I'm gonna go flush oh we got
flush let's go and I I what I wanna bank whoa who said that and yes I've been
trying to interact a bit more on YouTube on Twitter as well because all these
things kind of have been too impossible with what I'm juggling behind the scenes
but things are coming down I also got the first animation back and all the girls
reacted to it a sequel animated first for the video game and I think she's have
I think everyone was like what and I'm like yeah that's right that's what the
video game looks like and they're all like yeah so the plan is still June oh

spades and ended up with three of the spades wow we are not doing that hold on
discard and go for hat oh meh oh brother I think we're gonna have to go in

see all your comments I am so thankful for everyone that interacts with the post
fucking if you were on Twitter December right right how the fuck did you guys
say December all together is this an inside meme how did you guys sink to
December that's not a word am I freaking going crazy I'm losing it right we
don't even have this card so what all I can do is hike hard which is gonna give
me five and nothing more I really don't I don't want to but bro just give me a
diamond oh my god we actually lost maybe we lost we lost and we had so much
economy right go again holy crap we can't even get the freaking thing we
can actually share three plus hands the next time no okay let's not get greedy
for economy we already start with so much holy crap that minus one per thing
it begins literally the gamble begins I just want to warn you guys I truly and
wholeheartedly have no idea how long this stream is gonna go for you've been
worn do we have a royal shit we don't we didn't we do not have a royal shit we
have to double base 12 hours no and I have some exciting stuff that's cooking
I'm so sorry by the way for being so vague every time a royal shit literally
and I apologize so much for being so vague whenever I go on about something
it's because the plans are in motion and I'm like get why did I do that
what is that gonna take us over okay there we go I like it's because I can't
talk about it yeah but I want to tell you everything right three plus multiplier
for every Joker card that's just a straight-up dub first played face so
face or King Queen and Jack first played gives a multi and another one I don't
want to spend too much economy but at the same time I want to go all in I want
to go all in and get because of this Joker card what played car oh it's a
1.5 each King held in the hand gives a multiplier played cards with a heart
suit gives three wins scored and it has an overall multiplier and you come when
you come holy hell both of those are great three of a kind oh are we shaping
our deck yeah I think we're shaping our deck 12 multiplayer if a three of a
kind I think we have shaped our run we do not need what we are who are you
12 multiplayer 1.5 12 if it's a three of a kind and if it has a face on it okay
okay okay well we already have a royal flush which is fine let's go for that
face card yeah fantastic cheese a suit plus three of a kind is that viable not
quite but we're here to do it one plus hand size curious one plus hand size
that would enable us to get our three of a kind more I know this has a chance to
be destroyed I don't want to spend economy now to get destroyed so I'm
gonna buy and then we want to enhance three of a kind I know I'm spending
economy I know I know right three of a kind has now been maxed up so it's also
now extra potent thank you to Zanny Joker not to be confused with the wild
cow all spade cards are debuff thank goodness I'm hearts then right what are
we looking at we've got fuck all we wait we really have nothing we don't even
have a flush with one double and that's it I want to get rid of those I want to
go for a flush to be honest or should I rule for an eight yeah yeah I think you're
right rule for an eight right okay but what what if you gave us an eight or a
nine or a four for fuck's sake what throw those away so what happens if I do
you oh fucking one-on-one beautiful we love to see it shadow wizards when you
get right we're gonna oh we might want this because that's what saved me last
time it did is what saved me last time not really fuss for these I think I'm
gonna keep my economy I want to grab on to you because this saved us in our only
win that we've had so far upgrade four of a kind by three levels I'm not got four
of a kind I'm not playing for four of a kind she's cracked at Gamble I'm gonna go
for a cumulative Nimbus we're gonna get an extra dollar for this round and then
next round we'll see what it comes a bit oh dear I'm struggling to get my
threes in I it pains me to throw away it pains me to throw them away though
sorry one two bro just give me the nine I literally only need it like I only need
a nine or a K are another away an ace yeah okay this game has jokes thank you
right let's see if we do the triple strongy teaching us again but no don't
say such things she be caught and bum is live with ASMR please do check out her
ASMR because I'm just ranting like a lunatic about Gamble okay we're now
getting three interests if we hold on are we about to go against the boss
I need to buy this now create up to two random tarot cards oh it's a mega
celestial pack mother we are now addicted to Gamble yeah the strongy
bubbles never bust in trust this dummy you should play full house they contain
three pairs three of kind oh I didn't can I didn't even consider that and full
house would we'd take this into account but you're absolutely right right for
safety reasons
that have another round invest in strong coin new crypto currency just drop you
have to get a voucher now next battle is gone ah okay thank you refling I thought
that too I thought that too we're gonna get a dollar interest and I'm like
we just no I'll take the dollar interest it'll accumulate don't be greedy I'll
behave I'll behave okay a mega standard pack I'm not really fussed for that okay
let's see what we've got what's what we've got double evades we've got tons of
doubles I need that half written one I'm sorry there's so many doubles kind of
multiplayer whoa the multiplayer is so counted anyway I don't even need to fish
for triples when blind is selected gain three hands and lose all this hard a
celestial pack
actually here we're it doesn't matter if we spend the four we're only getting
two dollars interest anyway we're getting we're only getting two dollars
DJ and doker and Uranus a straight and a high high card as straight I feel like
might actually come up more than well two pairs is kind of a Hail Mary for us so
I'll go Uranus he's a troublemaker right next round all diamond cards are
debuff that's fine I don't really think that's a problem right we did just
double up pairs a upgrade pair so we're gonna send it and we unlock to Joker
don't mind me don't mind me at all okay and we got our interest that's
fantastic so now what we got foil holographic cars appear twice as often
what are you when small blind or big blind is selected gain a multiplier
destroy a Joker right around Joker we win in the house pack with this one the
Joker gets more money through more hands oops wait what over wait what this one
this one not this Joker oh sorry the last one we ain't gonna live on the
streets the criminal one the one from before all my apologies I was familiar
with it I'm gonna redeem the foil holographic so we're back down to two
economy pair round but that's fine that's fine we're still cooking discard
$1 pair use card what will give you 12 bucks sorry I don't understand if I
don't understand I'm not doing it because it doesn't make sense to me I'm gonna
need this half Joker because let's be honest I'm just playing doubles again
the triples really do not come out to play much a $5 orange net four times
multiplayer every six hands played wait hold on hold on I want rid of you then
four times multiplayer wait five remaining it says remaining it paid you
for every discard this one shit that was a really good one then I apologize I did
not read that properly but look this is why we learning on screen I was wondering
if I should record solo runs of me playing this and upload it as actual
like video content like oh this is the best one I've had but I don't know if
that's weird you can triple to occur so you play so you play five hands with
one times and one oh no okay that's not for me
spectral card spectral card I have no idea what's a spectral card is that the
one where it turns the card gold in that and no that would actually can kill
fee free to make some videos yes some people try it you know what try I will
try it what's going on here creates the planet card for final player poker hand
it's been held okay that's what we'll see create a tarot card if discarded I will
shove a discard because it's easier to discard than have it sitting on your hand
rotten away okay I like it I like it next round let's go what are you three
plus size decreased level of played poker hand but I think we're fine she's
famous last word right I know I keep playing doubles but it's right I'll you
know what fuck it I'll discard a bunch and we'll try and get a tenner jack are
you fucking I'm being trolled right now by this game give me a triple right fuck
you you're going out the window so what are you enhances to bonus card sure let's
make the aces bonus cards why not yes bonus card what do you do extra chips
play hands I can game is actually truly that is a pretty good tarot though I'll
take it okay we've got nine dollar he does sell this card to disable the current
boss blind wow that's unique each played ten or four gives an extra and for
molecular when I wonder if you had straights this would be a very strong
one okay these are tarot cards pack I'm not really can run so let me finish my
honey to you strongy for gore the full house I did a sorry I'm speedrun this
decreased level of played poker hand I think we're fine yes fine twos fours
we've got our first triple full house I remembered the full house I remembered
refling okay well we're already 50% of the way there and we didn't even do
anything yet so we'll just do doble v's for now play hands god that really knocked
down the value okay but we're fine we're absolutely fine we are smooth sailing
and before we actually have a successful run as good man and we got live in our
10 multiplier played face cards have a one-in-two chance to give money as well
fuck that we are grabbing you so what sell juggler has mummy gamb at the house
yet careful with this one we'll get that oh yeah okay bye hello and you come
convert up to three selected cards the space planet cards appear more
frequently in the shop mmm I want to invest in planets if I'm being honest I
think we're gonna need to start doing it before we get in trouble so a flush give
me a flush no not flush sorry a full house is why one full house yes give me
that and then give me give me give me you give me you give me you and then four
of a kind is so rare four of a kind is so rare right we've completely gone in
on even though three of a click kind yeah yeah yeah this is should I invest in
planet cards should I should you like Nicki Minaj what that's such a very
specific question what happens do you want me to start rapping this one's for
the boys with a booming system top-down AC with a cooling system when they come
up in the club I'd be blazing up they got stacks on stacks on decks like they
save it up is that what you wanted to hear to be honest
okay I finished my tea I actually finished my tea and I'm hydrated think
of the economy I know it's in shambles because people are paying off their debts
in society is built for you to be indebted and sleep planet cards appear more
frequently played face cards have a chance to give me money
I'll take it you have to tell me twice I'm wondering oh right if I do this I get
$3 if I do this I get $1 in interest which is really greedy but I kind of
want planets or what saved the run I'm sorry but mummy's gambling after
defeating the boss gain 25 extra hmm next-based addition there's a free thing
a extra large blind soon made the strongy man come to bring us reef flings soon
made the strongy man come to bring us reef flings peeing tongue I don't have a
managed to figure out what you were putting there strongy I forgot to
mention that girlfriend also hit different did you like the girlfriend I
thought it was so bad sounded just like her honestly I'm actually Nicki Minaj
for real for real you need to store money because there's a 20k wall and all
that's why I'm trying to invest in planets because the bonus that planets
give is just insane I only have full house and three of a kind levelled up
I'm needing to invest in planets oh I'm needing to invest in planets
just skip for 25 bucks and say fuck it oh you need the money right I need the
money okay you have to tell me twice I'm a good girl I need the money I need the
money I'm wondering that I try and get a fucking what do you do if I play a face
card I have a chance to get money right go for it played face cards have a one
and two chance to give money when scored right give me money now do it yes it
popped we got an extra two dollars let's go let's go it popped it popped I heard
it went okay because of that factor oh we're actually went off from a flush you
know that I really don't want to throw these away but I want to play face
card okay okay okay pop again do it oh we go six doll hairs because so much
bonus wait and the bonus counted because we've reached the bonus so we're
gonna when blind is like to destroy Joker to the right and permanently add
double it's that's a member getting paid please straw me moan quietly I have you
on speakers oh there we go nice and quiet the gulping in the burps made me
think of Emmys Pandario I listened to that for the first time yesterday I was
actually too scared to listen to it and I listened to it and I was like oh wow
I actually don't mind we're losing her to the gambon yeah move the polychrome
Joker to the far right it will give you most mullies in that position see I
don't know how you guys know that but it's so good you guys are so smart right
this is useless we're gonna keep economy keep economy choose one of three
playing cards to add to the deck oh wait hold on what a waste of fucking money
were you next base it becomes a polychrome 1.5 multi what the sigma first
played face card gives to multi I might skip in order to get this 1.5 multi one
because you're starting to you're starting to grind my gears and you're
not really doing too much I can't reroll the boss if I decide to 20k wall is a
risk are you sure I feel like I make so much money I'm like doing this in one
round I have four hands personally played up to purple steak with a few
deck oh do we do it jokers activate left to right yeah if you wanted the audio
it'd be more realistic there'd be a kiss if you need gulp and burping
photograph but can't photograph is kind of weak yeah if you skip you go straight
to the boss though purple steak is doable if you've got the good jokers
you will have to fish for the full house to save the wall shit okay what does it
mean right I'm gonna trade out this for a 1.5 multiplier I can't play my last
town my my last hand so what do you play
okay that was that was three
we're gonna try and get faces up in here I'm fucking kidding me
am I fucking up I think I'm fucking up
oh I'm getting fucking trolled shit shit oh no refunds what have I done
mummies are we oh no I can only do a fucking ace card ace card and like throw
this stuff away
oh mummies not very smart oh mummies not very smart darlin oh mummies very mummies
very silly so I can't play high card I can't play a double I can't play a quote
I really do what fucking triple and throw this shit away oh wait well when
five consecutive rounds by playing only one hand okay tuples hand okay mummy
through cuz she got too cocky we lost the house the house is gone right I'm
sure we can win with a yellow dick it literally gives so much economy at the
start gives a free mega arco pack initially initial cards and booster packs
are free in the next shot don't have to don't have to tell me twice honestly
we're always going on here lucky cards increase the rank gives a total sale
but oh wait no that's alright a gold card three dollars if this card is held in
the round now let's put some lockdown even if you lose the house I'll still
have the refunds exactly that's the main thing right what do you do let's just
shove on a gold card then oh wait what gives the tools no stop I keep getting
confused and think temperance is the other one increase the rank of cards
three bucks if it's held in your hand at the end of the round sure let's just
have on a wee one devil the two oh my god we thought the same thing are we all
diamond cards are debuff that's fine right
can you give me anything what's going on wave streamer luck gone right we'll
play a double and get rid of all this shit where is my streamer luck
hello I'm not a streamer luck wait hold on man idea flush flush no oh my god the
house is literally gone we'll be here for you through rain or sleet or slag
literally what did you call me I have a double I guess I can play the double
it's not gonna be very effective but it's the best I can do I'm gonna lose
brah I think I'm actually gonna live what should I go for a flush maybe I
think I should go for a heart's flush you know that I'm going for hearts flush
okay that's what we want to see one two three four five hearts flushes go I lost
again I lost again I have one more discard buying gonna do none I freaking
suck at this game brah I lost again go again go again go again get again
double skip is the hardest start I know but it's free boy the cardboard box
isn't that bad guys like you guys look I'll get us out of the cardboard box see
I lost all my money because cardboard box but now but now I'll do it you know
hold on sorry definitely worth skipping for those two nah I'm with you on that
one right let's see can I get a flush nine eight seven six five four three two
one zero okay okay okay I'm seeing some there's some form of streamer luck
coming through I should roll for a heart I want to kind of keep these I want to
roll for a heart though it was risky and it didn't pay off but it's fine because
we can play doubles it was risky it was risky I admit it okay we're gonna get
two extra for economy at $14 which is juicy so I still pack always contain a
planet as well 10 multiplayer if to pair well I know what kind of run word
where do we ink in the box I need some privacy you ink on me of course hello
what do you need privacy for I mean technically you're covered you know your
tentacle gets hidden you know right we're definitely not letting this Joker go
waste I a celestial pack will also contain a planet which is absolutely
insane insane I want it mummy wants it okay I've never bought that before sorry
I'm going all out I'm going all out fuck the economy I'm going into debt right
okay four bucks if you know another would flush why are they so bad when
small blind or biggest like to gain a multiplier and destroy a random Joker
no earn four bucks if I mean I'm gonna pick it up because I'd rather just sell
it then skip then what pick up pick up the jumbo pack I can't even pick it up
I'm too poor right we're gonna purposely earn four bucks if the poker hand is a
flush poker hand changes at end of round what what are you saying right we're
just gonna take the $1 interest I have no idea what it was asking me I was
asking for something but I'm not smart enough save the money on interest yeah
you better I know I should save I know I know but I get I get greedy okay I don't
know why like digital like not real gamble is so fun because I'm like I'm
not angry when I lose because I'm it's I'm not losing money so I'm not mad like

we're gonna grab the turret we love you to have it around here yes we do
convert into space initial cards and booster packs are it's tempting oh no

win it's a one in four Uranus get in here oh my god Uranus is getting out
control hold on wait two six say by 14 I think this is getting like wildly out
control this run okay no repeat at hand type so make it count what do you do a
multiplier while it stays in hand okay so we'll do our first double that's fine
play hands that's fine that's not problem and then we'll see where that break
takes us up oh we did it we didn't even need to like do anything oh my truth
there's the ROP play cards as a spade now four of a cane not really permanently
give a yes I would absolutely adore that especially when we get in trouble and a
tarot card I didn't use that again classic me never use my fucking tarot card
what do you do take select two cards and convert the left into the right I don't
know what to convert convert the two of heart convert the two of heart into a
steel diamond oh yeah baby and I got 10 for that okay what we're looking at here
well gold card spades double money which would take me up to 28 another steel
card or a wild card some of this temperance turn a second one into a
steel nope it's gain 20 not double money oh it gives the total cell value
currently 20 oh that's quite a lot to mess around with and I'll get a lot of
interest I think I'm gonna go with the 20 because then I can get more interest
because it goes up to 50 my max ceiling is 50 hermit is double the money yes
temperance and hermit I keep I keep messing up right we'll do money we'll do
money classic women moment I mean we might as well muck with the booster pack
cuz this isn't gonna hit the thing sure absolutely in you come right don't
really need any of that four of a kind I don't think I'm ever gonna roll that I'd
rather just save it no we do not need free re-rolls at the shop but we are
thankful for your offer nonetheless we're gonna level up again our lovely 22
multiplier so 24 oh you can't even be doing this to me game no wonder I'm
addicted sorry but no wonder I'm actually addicted I'm sorry but no wonder

pluses and the times differently and it's not all the same I've just discovered

up there but I feel like I get so much more of Uranus oh wait just buy and stick
Mars up there and then buy that and then buy these and I can still level up

show up oh it worked out in the end it worked out in the end please get
twitching baby it's time get twitching get twitching oh oh oh oh oh oh we didn't
weep we didn't weep oh oh oh oh what's gonna do something silly but this is
gonna spawn in my planet card so I'm gonna use this because she is so kind
and spawns in my plan what I thought by default she spawns in my card no I thought
she spawned in my card by default okay okay it's fine it's fine it's fine okay
it's just the Celestia pack okay it's fine I'm sure I'll come across another
one I'll just buy that anyway cuz you know what do you do one now it's fine I
don't need that right all face cards are debuffed good thing I don't need to
rely on that eight seven six five four I mean I can randomly play a flush if I
wanted to just to get rid of all of these since oh that's rubbish though that's so
rubbish I think I'm better just getting rid of these sorry
uh-huh oh yeah all right get rid of you get rid of you is eight I'm no down an eight
ten has much of a chance to show up jacks have a high chance to show up a king I
don't want to I don't want to throw I don't want to do this but for the motherland
okay I worked out somehow I worked out I know it's debuffed but we'll see what
happens yeah I know it's debuffed but oh
Gimli I heard that shit oh my god I'm actually gonna have to avoid those
card shark activated though oh okay there's not much fours there's three
fives remain and there's only two sixes nine there's a very high chance of a
nine showing up queen can't these are the luck I need the king what's the jack the
lower percent okay there we go let's see what happens okay
is this the end is this the end of my endless oh I don't have any more
discards oh no this can't be I think this is it I think this is the end of our
endless mode you could use a high card as a discard I think I'm gonna have to I
want to hold on to you you all can go eight there's only two on the field five
there's three on the field four there's only one left no get in to get rid of
yeah king you can go you've done your service nine I want to keep because of
the multiplier so we're gonna play and get rid of you all don't disappoint me
am I reading that wrong or is the game trolling me with odds tough luck okay I
was gonna say I'm a I was like did I get that completely wrong and
misunderstand okay so this is the last four this is one six there's two more
nine there's two more 10 there's two more Jack there's such a high chance of a
five games trolling you what I would say yeah okay 10 has to go we want the nine
in hand Jack has to go your debuff
this is rubbish I'm not gonna make it no right if I use only one of them you
don't give me anything special other than we're gonna keep that name in the
hand we're gonna keep the ace in the hand in the hand yep and then just use
five well that was a good endless run oh wait he's twitching he's twitching no
he was twitching was he not was he getting close oh that was a fantastic
how close was that I wasn't even off that much that was so good we did it we
unlocked have a gold playing card with a gold seal when round begins add a random
playing card with a random seal to your hand Joker unlocked when a run without
playing three of a kind well you don't have to tell me twice
ghost deck unlocked when a run with yellow deck on any difficulty spectral
cards may appear in the shop with a hex card in one hand Erin at least one
million poker chip each played nine of spade gives time to Molly when scored
card changes every round okay so we have a little seal here to save we've done
the yellow deck we've done the blue deck so we're gonna actually do the red deck
which is the one you're supposed to start on but I never got it so we have an
extra discard round and rerolls the next no we don't care about next base
edition shop has a Joker only get that bad boy may get that bad boy right let's
see what we're looking with and let's see what we're cooking and looking with
right refresh your brain we can do a flush not quite royal but a flush
nonetheless reset oh wow bang on the flush gave us bang on the demand okay
right let's take it easy let's take it easy last times five I think we keep
our money I want to build a con oh no I'm skipping I'm skipping for the Joker
oh hey stencil you take it times five I trust you refling I trust you refling you
know what you're doing better than I do right we've got a double of a off the bat
okay now remember they don't score the way the way it usually scores we've got
a single pair they're gonna take us over the edge is there you go and just like
that just like that don't mind if I do it right what's her free oh brother this
guy stinks okay a permanent discard make coming handy put him in front of the
stencil yes sir she keeps skipping the straight I'll skip your straight in a
minute I don't I don't know what that means but right there's no point in
doing any of this stuff after defeating the boss get 25 all face cards are drawn
25 bucks economy right at the start it's honestly pretty good shop has a free
uncommon oh fuck it sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm feeling it I'm
feeling it I'm feeling myself right now shit I never thought that far ahead hold
on a minute I've I've I've severely didn't think that through and what do
you do first plate face card give a two plus multiplayer wins scored I'm going
to play all of this and then I'm gonna play five of the face down card oh well
that actually worked out really well somehow I don't know how but yeah that
went really well um I'm just gonna keep doing this okay and then we're gonna play all five
four of a cane yeah I was a bit overkill for that one I'm not gonna lie it worked look it worked
what defeat the boss blind wait oh 25 dollars I forgot already okay and you're free sell this
card to disable don't make me too disappointed now she okay does nothing we'll redeem it because
I don't know when this is gonna unlock uh right we're gonna need to start shaping our deck I would
like to shape it please
doubles all listed probabilities is that good I've not discovered it
scammed yeah honestly take the blank but yeah
doubles all listed probabilities I think run a flush deck this time okay let's try flush
all the same color flush it down the toilet that's how it works three of a cane
is that what we want
more just cards it's easier to find a suit okay all the same color
you're starting to get a bit me
it's free it's free
flush and three of a kind is very hard to work with flush five my beloved yes sir
any as long as you call me your little seaweed and then anything for you okay all the same
color heart heart heart heart so all you guys can go to Spain
am I being trolled heart you're not heart you're not heart you're not heart go away
go away
okay
yeah that's what I thought that's what I thought
yeah that's what I thought freaking getting trolled you can sort by suit okay I will remember that
uh don't need tariffs and stuff sorry I would I just want to save my economy I don't know
I want to get 50 economy I'm not I'm I don't feel very confident about our run I'm being honest
unless unless unless unless the tarot cards I can start swapping deck to like one deck color
shit you only get five interest right now anyway
I guess it's wheel of fortune who do I want to on though like
me
please the last tire or planet card use none so it's not gonna do anything
either stencil or bluish the hanged man destroy
fuck it the wheel fuck it I love a good gamble oh oh I'm gonna get rid of that if I'm in trouble
oh well I tried okay let's see what's going on here create two random tarot cards sure
what we got two planet doubles money sure don't mind if I do create up to two random
planet cards okay I'm going for a flush I tried doesn't mean I got it but I'll upgrade these just
in case I find myself in a rough spot when blind is selected destroy joker to the right and
permanently I double itself out I don't get that at first hand of round has only one card no
okay knife will get stronger both destroying jokers and will enhance stencil
so
they won't paramount enhance stencil
I'm gonna end up leaving stencil behind
and wait hold on hold on hold on hold on hold on let me think let me think let me think
if I actually sell these two no they have temples multi oh I can't do math
oh my head is spinning stencil needs sell yes that's what I'm thinking get rid of stencil
for better stuff that comes in okay we're getting rid of stencil I'm sorry I'm sorry if it's the wrong
choice but I want rid of stencil right if it's all the same color flush it down what we got
we've got three hearts and we've got three jacks
and the deck is equal as it can be
oh I need to commit to one color what do you want heart
think hard think hard me think hard are you joking I'm a dumber okay we got another heart
okay we got no heart
finally one two three four five go
okay that's good that's good we are ahead but we're gonna need to get some juicy upgrades
what do you do 10 multiplier if you click no uh face face cards give a
they are not making this one easy really crap
select two to convert the ray creates a random joker must have room what we do random joker
our emperor again
I don't know I like doing the wheel just for the hell of it if this flush could grab the wheel
that'd be great wheel move wrestler in front yes sorry sorry sell stencil fuck you bitch
that's right I'm good at listening
so stencil can't pick up the wheel okay so I want to sell locador
I'm leaving him to win because if he picks up the wheel again I'm gonna be pissed
okay no one got the wheel that's fine um
um
I honestly I'm needing something to help with these fluffy
nothing's kind of helping me have pick up smells sure
wow nothing's really helping me though we're not really getting shaped
I don't give a fuck oh wait shit I do
I'm sure I'll hit something fuck that was awful
fuck it ah right what color diamonds I've got three
okay did I just lose like so many diamonds in that pack am I going crazy
so there's hardly any diamonds in the pack that three are on the board that's why and I used to
oh you know what all these and then go for clubs clubs have a higher chance
and not clubs the other one no one two three four
right so I just need one more then oh my god I'm so sorry I'm just joking right it's hard
couldn't actually you know what we're never doing flush again because we
right about time go I swear this game loves trolling like it genuinely loves trolling
okay we got 12 that's good
played cards with suit gives a fucking three plus no one consumable slot
this is specific I'll show you my consumable slot I'll have you know adds double the rank
uh pick that up and go for spade flush spade flush okay
okay whatever we can say because I'm too dumb to figure out how the freaking flushes work
the only thing I'll be flushing is myself down the toilet because I remember what I'm playing
uh actually good hello actually good hello hello hello hello
hello actually good okay then what are you
all right as much as you want to find the arena packs and convert the space as much as possible
literally wow are you oh a tarot card when destroyed
I'm tempted
I'm tempted I think the tarot gamble use that and convert it to a spade
yeah I know exactly one consumable slot this thing up here
I mean do I need it not really
maybe if I accidentally redeem the um not the hyrule fan the one that gives to right spade
and a spade looks like this yeah goodbye everything
goodbye everything goodbye everything goodbye everything I want a spade card
spade and spade yeah goodbye okay one two three four five let's go
not bad but we are gonna need some planetarium upgrades because it's not
wait wait wait wait I had this splash card in another run is this not op is anything
is this not op is anything splash isn't great on flush though
oh no say it's not true hold on hold on say it's not true not good with a flush build
no how fucking how many times have you guys played this game how do you move so well
um right okay spade a face card a flush and then I can sell that when I panic
actually what's ahead of me playing cards played against with that air debuff that's fine
I I'm gonna be honest I don't think this is a winning run I've maxed out a deck in this game
and all difficult okay now far too much never played it I have like 60 plus hours that's decent
you gotta start putting face uh face cards yes that will be very nice
right my lovely spade you're not spade you're not spade you're spade you're not you're not you are
goodbye
can I just do that though
I know it's not a face card but I think it gives me enough
hold on let's test it how much does it give me
oh no oh no that's actually not good
sorry buy suit yes sorry I said I was gonna do that and then I'm not doing that okay so
I guess we're better going for clubs now
I said we're better going for cut loves now thank you
okay uh I will be admit I don't think I'm that confident
we have such high economy but we have nothing decent to spend it on right what are you
15 plus multi not times plus because there's a difference if you didn't know like don't
worry if you're new to the game don't be embarrassed if you're learning but you know some
some classic noobs don't know the difference between plus 15 and times multipliers there's
such goofy cubers you know right what are you a flat four multiplier you're just plus four you're
not times four though
I don't think we've won this run
so goofy I know it's okay you don't need to be embarrassed though like it happens
create a copy of a joker destroys all other jokers oh
oh
converse all cards in hand to a single random suit
there's too many clubs here to sacrifice into something else
gamble or do you want me to gamble it
fuck it
wait is that the right one was that the right one I didn't see it
oh my god it was the right one
wait it wasn't wait oh it wasn't it was club sorry they're both the same color so I can hardly see
the difference oh sorry I get confused between these symbols I feel like they're so similar
because they both have three points on them like do you know what I mean like point point point
flat point point point flat like they're the same thing I don't know if that sounds silly but
they're the same they're different but the same turn on high contrast mode you don't have to tell
me twice setting and before this is gonna be like so obvious now someone tears okay basically just
run in black suit flush now okay I mean I might as well just add a random freaking thing yeah
sure it's not gonna over discard it yeah
I'm needing I'm needing something better than what we've got I don't I do not believe I'm sorry I don't
believe I'm so oh it's blue abadi abadi right we have more blues than oh wait so yeah no already
I don't actually want to discard these too much though ah I don't like this run
I don't like this run at all
okay that was incredibly lucky because now we're gonna try and get spades one
which we are very close to getting a spade flush oh but I don't like this
discard creates a turret when discarded that's what I want that's what I want to see baby what
do you do two planet cards fuck it give me it yeah give me a street flush what do you do yeah
give me a flush that's actually what we needed okay one two three four five
why do you
fine then geez why is that so it's so pernicki it doesn't like me oh for gonna see great
creates a turret card when discarded well you're out what we looking at
there's actually quite a lot clubs right let's just
let's just throw everything into the wind what are you enhances multi-card
unbelievably we actually did it
and oh wow it removed their debuff as well how interesting
well that was considerable that Empress came in clutch I think we're gonna have to definitely
utilize turret cards a bit more re-rolls cost two bucks less well that's rubbish uh no that's rubbish
we are we are out here
we're doing what's called a flush not a straight a straight's when it's in a roll oh my god
a straight flush is the best we got like didn't even need Luke Kador I don't know
that interaction existed thanks for teaching me something what did it what did I do
you played them earlier that's why they're except okay
you need jipper or no straight flush is still technically a flush literally none of these options
right you I don't want you anymore you don't do anything what's the blind anyway
decrease of level played full for hand well sure sell you
oh one free re-roll I'll pop them on right now like I don't know
I don't like it I feel like we're like we're gonna lose and I'm putting on my
my time and effort and my love wait who has more
I have more clubs so I'll add another club and you come
did I re-roll for a better joker fuck earn five bucks for each discarded number three
these are shit
I don't know if I should buy that and just burn through
I feel like if we don't do something now we're in so much trouble
no no these are awful nothing is complimenting
okay if I have a high economy fuck it I'm sorry these are terrible I do not have faith I'm so sorry
I genuinely don't have faith right now I don't have faith this is too much oh as if I need one of
each yeah okay get right I'm sorry I'm sure I'm like completely messing this up but I don't have faith
I know I'm wanting to change the strategy but we're not gonna like be able to do that
uh I don't have faith I'm sorry I'm a non-believer we're not gonna it's not gonna happen this
friend there's no way we're like just not making it I think we're going for him I'm sorry
sell the bull and go for plus money
do you have a lot of faith card I have more than average yeah
oh wait no hardly I've got like only two but I'm doing I'm going for flushes
and clubs
it's not really maybe it smells sale sorry maybe sell smiley 13 faith cards
oh
why is this so hard
no I need a new joker
why are these so awful
ah I'm getting sun locked I do not believe sorry
where was my biggest hand uh clubs are you a club no are you a club yeah and you come
uh just give me this shit sorry I'm just spending we're not I I do not I doubt right don't want diamonds
spades I'm happy to turn something into a spade right you can all become spades
oh someone says wheel no no wheel we need we need to go all in and then I need levels up on
fucking flushes but the game is refusing to give me a fucking flush
I swear god if I go for this and his shit I'm gonna be raging I'm gonna be raging
oh my god
oh my god right get rid of all that
where are you hearts I don't need heart I'm in fucking trouble right these two surely will
give me a fucking blue club okay thank you okay play the first one I've completely missed
that oh right okay okay okay okay okay okay okay let me get up let me get up let them get up
I've only got five hearts left and seven diamonds I can't even
I need a blue okay literally literally by a ball here we will make this if I get
and what the sigma I need I need I need speed
okay that's all you had to do that's all you had to do I think I believe
wow please let me level up flush this is awful
re-triggered re-triggers all cards played for the next 10 hands
man I can't take this shit no more we're freaking
due to your selling the dude early the boss's auntie still applies
no flush and only log you just unlabeled flush I mean it's free
this is the worst I think we've ever had flush finally took you long enough to show up don't
be shy to show up again I'm gonna need a permanent hand if we want to even have a slim chance of
winning right who is my most I've got clubs give me more club and club club money or club
sitting in the hand if it sits in the hand it's a lot more valuable
we're just splashed it's splash it's splash terrible pick up the voucher it's basically
a lifeline yes I actually agree uh do we want oh my god sorry if I go bug bite on my leg
refling what if you just bit me
reflames did one of you just bite me on my juicy thighs what's going on
all right okay splash does nothing sorry splash is good if your hand doesn't have less than five
cards okay it was me no I thought I literally just thought bug bite that's probably the only
scary thing no fuck off I don't believe it's gonna be any good Ardua
oh my god I think I'm gonna have to double skip
I need I'm like struggling to win but if I can have three hands in a round without having to discard
oh fuck it fuck it we're we're hardly gonna win so let's just go bigger go home
um
gee willikers I wonder what that card is hmm it's a mystery well good luck I sure hope I don't mess
this one up okay I love sorting by suit okay
okay
there's so little hearts in the deck you guys are not worth having around
diamonds again you're rare but we're only one off oh I wonder what that one is
chucks the game almost got me I don't think I'm gonna make it maybe
right if I hold you in my hand I'll hold you
oh wow I actually did it holy crap that paid off I don't know how about I did
okay right what is my joker
wait hold on copies the joker ability to the right hold on hold on hold on hold on
right you're about to perish anyway
what do you do speed okay yeah blueprint but with what
I think blueprint and then joker and then get rid of photograph
and that's gonna expire naturally which is fine
so get rid of joker because he only does it once
first played face card gives the times two multi win scoring I get that it's big but
yeah just get rid of photograph okay sell you copies the ability the joker to the right so buy
you put you here and then sell spritz because it's gonna expire anyway I understand I just get rid
of straight joker um what crafty joker you want rid of him it is only 80 chips if it's a flush
yeah no I'm um what do I need to sacrifice I feel like that's gonna expire so there's no
point in keeping it around
mmm the 80 chips
I feel like you're doing nothing bro I do right so copies the ability to the right and it's compatible
so it's giving me 15 multi plus 10 multi for an extra 25 multi flush isn't worth it yeah
have blueprint next to seltzer for now okay I will agree with that and then when it perishes
we will move it in front of him rip chips stop have a mess up please give me joker oh my god this
game hates me
none of these are useful for me right now unfortunately well I'll go with planet earth
because why not right we're gonna do playing card because I want to keep adding to my clubs
basically
yes please get in that it so we're 22 clubs 18 space only 10 hearts and 10 diamonds
definitely want to start getting tarot cards that override these hearts and diamonds would be best
honestly
what do you do no fuck off you rubbish offer
whoa okay you you you you you go
that was a lot of movement for me not comprehending create a tarot card when discarded
okay so diamonds and hearts you're out because you guys I don't have enough of you what do you do
enhances something into a steel card I mean sure just sit right there I doesn't really matter
like I can still get a value out of it than I
oh wait I put it should have put it on a lower one sorry sorry sorry it's fine it's fine it's fine
okay okay okay okay okay maybe we've recovered a little bit if we can get a few jippers to get
more stupor uh
I know I should try and keep economy I know
I know right please jipper is all I ask thank god and it is a flush all the same color
it's all the same color flush it down the toilet okay and then we're gonna add
uh another club from this pack that we're a hundred percent gonna get
oh no I mean the odds of a the tarot card is so valuable though I know that gives 50 chips
hmm what do you say
DNA can help you make some face cut boil is a good one because you want to play the clubs I know
the tarot card might just save my arse cheeks you're right
can I see if I wait oh right okay now uh if first hand on round only has one card
our dependent copy to deck and draw it that's a joker
another time another time we'll come back to you we'll come back to you another time right you
enhance two cards into a lucky card I mean I can do that for literally anyone sorry I keep
forgetting it's clubs blue okay so we can get rid of these because we can't have them
okay that was lucky ish
I definitely want to eliminate any hearts and diamonds at this point
if I can get a tarot card to bless us spritzer little spritzers getting a bit weak now
right one two three four five what do you do
I'll keep you for now I'll see if my lucky cards pop off
okay could be worse
create a tarot card when discarded okay against my best interest what do you do
say
okay whatever whatever right we're gonna have to do these unfortunately
I'll pop that in the oh wait I can't pop wait can I pop it in the shop I think I can't pop it
oh I'm getting nervous when we spritzer goes away though because it's ogre
no I'm need I'm needing jupiter's like I'm needing jupiter's bad that's what's gonna resurrect this
you can use it in shop okay that's good doubling money doubling money but actually this time not
scamming yay right what's going on here not you not you your ship I ask I pray I ask for jupiter
to get more stupider
I am being troll and that's okay jupiter I call upon you
no thank goodness gravy I am desperate I am on my hands and knees jupiter what are we looking at
not full house flush
oh we're literally have more in full house I can do it again right sure straight three of a cane
straight flush is the best I got next round I don't have the economy to be messing around how many
oh no he's about to break
full house is giving more than flush honestly because it's cheeky bad pause
yes it's just worth more
lose a dollar per car plate that's fine our economy's bad anyway does it mean oh we're
gonna keep that in hand hopefully one two three four five go
I took five bucks from me am I gonna go in debt I thought this was a fantasy game why is
they putting realistic aspects into gamble give me my money back what are you doing
give me that shit back great let's get rid of these give me my money back
what the heck is realistic okay now move blueprint to the left
so blueprint abstract and then if I play a face card and if I play a spade it's just
can we play cards when we run out of money I don't know I'm going to discard the tarot
because I want to see if it gives me a tree I gave me a tree literally taxes
literally got tax playing a freaking a gamble game thank you boy for the tip literally what the
heck right I want to keep that ace I want to keep the ace very badly because it's giving me a
multiplier here we go right 10 10 9 7 5 go have fun do something
I don't like that no the chances of me rolling another club is high I'm sorry I'm going to
have to sacrifice the ace I'm sorry I have to sacrifice the ace I didn't want to
no we lost we actually lost for realsies though the fuck do you do
no we actually I knew it I knew it freaking
as I have clubs clubs I need clubs
oh my god
not good not good
no wow that was so rough that was like a terrible don't play the scene
whatever you do don't play the scene you know what they say the house always wins
yeah you were freaking making sure I was losing that was terrible honestly
create a tarot card when blame just like this okay
I see you little card oh I was actually minus money as well that's quite funny
just so you know strong either it's a joker you unlock after you get three wild cards in your
deck that make your hearts and diamonds count as one suit the same for cotton space oh okay
right is there any easier deck at the end um these all look really hard okay sorry these
all look too hard let's just keep doing one extra discard we just need a joker to be kind to us okay
I'm here for it that's useless um right okay I can see a bit better now because of the different
clothes okay everything we remember throw out the window because
uh because I said so smile would I need a king a king and then we have a flush
fine doubles then jeez I just want to get the joker that's in the shop waiting for me
oh and there's the king yeah yeah yeah up my arse what does it say yeah um
I don't have a particularly high chance of rolling a flush
but might as well might as well go for it
I see this game see this game how dare this game make me so addicted to it but absolutely
clueless on what to do honestly right I can't believe I'm actually doing maths in a freaking
video game right just get rid of the lower number sorry I'm not counting fuck that how dare this game
make me actually use my brain honestly it has nothing but the cheek and the audacity to make
me use my brain all right we've got a full house surely full house will do it oh god
okay thank goodness right what's my real joker uh right
uncommon jokers give a multiplier right you know what's crazy I don't have any
right do we spend right we're only going to get one dollar interest anyway so we might as well go
for it uncommon uncommon and they're both common why because why wouldn't they be I'm losing it when
blind is selected to create two common jokers 12 three of a kind okay are we already shaping our
decks any deck shapers I'm shaping mine right now three of a kind three of a kind you'll never
guess what I got and a full house let's go three of a kind give me a baby
fuck you give me the rest right now we need to upgrade three of a kind we already have our shape
which is good okay and we've got clearance sale to lower the price of everything
oh if I do that I can only buy one pack
if mmm because you got free jokers you could just sell them I don't
if I get more rare that 1.5 gets out of control pretty quickly right what's the deal
okay this stays so if I keep my economy
I will get two dollars interest and then I'll buy it next round I'll keep my economy
oh you skipped the first yeah spectral is worth it usually
I only get one dollar interest if I go for it though I might as well just
fuck it go for it spend all create a random rare joker but sets money to zero you'll never
guess how much money I have on hand right now destroy one random card in your hand but add
three random enhanced face cards destroy one random and add four random enhanced number cards
wait incantation is better than familiar create a copy of a random joker but destroys all other jokers
go all in on three of a kind sell this and go all in on three of a kind
someone says take race it's not worth it okay race race okay

okay wait is the scholar there by the scholar okay okay okay uh priestess into empress okay
let's do planets I got venice I can't believe it actually got venice I'm so lucky right and then
last but not least uh into empress multi-card I don't know maybe if I get high economy I can
just spend absolutely everything fuck it sorry if I get high economy I can just spend spend
right you guys want me to get this scholar uh we'll just do this as well we'll utilize this
shortly we're not going to do this because it's going to lower my hand however I do have high
economy now so uh we'll just try your best um
um
high card
high card is all we can do right now
um
go for aces and 10 oh shit I've just used one
um
um
high card again
surely I'll get one triple okay that's all I needed we're going to double it up and we're
going to go quads and then we'll keep the fours we'll get rid of the two and the seven
and that's the best we can do right now
wow that was kind of lucky not gonna lie I was that was that was rough that was rough
we can double double's money wait am I getting an extra like fucking 20 quid for spending two quids
stop this is so good okay oh my god there's our two pair oh blank
we're almost gonna unlock whatever that is right tarot cards give me something I want baby
stone two more tarot cards sure give me two more
fuck wait do we want clubs no it's spades we won
one
were you
create the planet card for final play to poker hand in the round
create the tarot card planet create the planet card for final play
uh obelisk just saved you wait did that actually I was even paying attention
obelisk is dying is it I'm so sorry obelisk I'm not even paying attention to you I don't
like it because I can't like comprehend it strength is nice if you use it on 10
that's a brutal five of spades literally get money or a 50 foil as well
that wait that thing's stacked it's got the circle on it the gold and a seal
when I saw the bellel voucher I read that it's something totally different what balanese
if you have a blue seal at the end it's a free planet creates a planet card for final play
sell the first joker and obelisk what for it wouldn't aid me would it
want bat and just roll for a new joker
yeah yeah yeah okay wait if I just start I don't want to tire it I want to plan it
okay obelisk I agree with selling she still has a joker slot oh have multiple
you know what fuck you I literally don't have one uncommon
I'm going out on three of a cane
the two pairs can re-roll buy that and then re-roll
this joker gains two plus multiplier for every real roll in the shop well good thing I have
freaking economy are you joking is that a joke is that real
go for full house yeah
that's bizarre and it's uncommon right so you finally compliment you you mean bam
and then what you two are like card and then what are you just a random thing and you're random as well
you need to be at the end though so it's like active and then you
sell two pairs and buy a new joker
sell two pair and buy a new joker and now sell the first joker
Gigi should be at the end
why sell two pair yeah because my triple will get counted in a two pair if I do full house angle as well
fill house will trigger both of those yes that I re-roll to get a multi activity
I mean one re-roll can't hurt yeah he literally got it well
four of a cane no hi hi no
um yeah this is another rough looking one I'm gonna be honest
oh wait did I just fuck up did I just fuck up
I hope I didn't mess up no okay right so you're gonna activate when a double goes
you are gonna help you
I see aces so get rid of all of this oh I'm so close to a flush
honestly four of a kind apart you have to sell some jokers in New York yeah
right two pair three of a kind so I need a right I need to fill house
how am I so proud of this girl can I get a king or an ace please
I'm just gonna have to play something
two pair go for it and the ace should trigger on that at least
what do you do oh piss it's always too late increases the rank of up to two cards by one
right so I'm gonna make some nine some tens I know I suck you don't have to tell me
it's silly compare up to three selective cards to clubs sure let's make everything clubs
like it makes a difference to this point I can do a flush if I want to
uh just do two pairs again for how strong are you better than giving to me I'm getting
rolled and is this deck is like so hard for no reason hold on I want a double
there's more three four and six and eight can go three four six and eight can go and then I can get
I know for a fact I'm reading these odds correctly and being trolled out the wazoo
I know I am reading these correctly and can get a full house I am being trolled so hard
with odds right now holy holy holy holy holy holy right eight can get to fuck
six can get to fuck
I can I'm getting trolled so bad looking at the odds honestly
well where are you when your room begins add a random playing card with a random
feel to your hand well that's kind of cool four of a kind I don't really have that choose a joker
well it's gonna have to be better than anything I've got on my persons
every played card counts in scoring
gain 15 chips if it's a straight times four multi if played hand contains four of a kind
that's so rare I don't have any played it it's an uncommon the rare you want splash
is splash good with my current thing baseball jokers like having a laugh at me just sell them
no wait splash is bad oh the one in the shop is uncommon my apologies okay just skip these
I don't think I'm going to get rid of what eight chips or 12 plus
what one sell the two of a kind pair two of a kind okay I'll take your advice
and you come right so now you are giving me multiplier for that as well when round begins
add a random playing card with a random seal in your hand or or a seal in in your hand more likely
than you think okay add a playing card make it good make it a tarot or something oh right
we roll so I can boost him boom right what do you do a joker a tarot a planet and a
spectral card may appear multiple times what does that mean this joker gains three plus
chips paired discarded club card new card with a seal
two parts is in the Fibonacci sequence he's better than scholar is he I mean I'll take
him he's uncommon so he's gonna hit with him fuck you scholar and you come you
we now have 1.5345 and then six times six multiplier because of all these guys
surely that's how it works surely I'm gonna re-roll again to give him a little boost
I know I shouldn't but each played queen of diamond gives a two times malt that's a bit much
I mean you could get like multiple of the baseball jokers yeah I feel like a bit of that
that was like a dog and not a seal or or wait moose
am I good pup for you so many uncommon literally that's uncommon as well
that one's far too specific though yeah what do you mean my seal sound isn't good or
or you know you you buy upgrade high card by three levels well I'm not playing high far
first hand is drawn face down that's fine well why did you shake when discarded
I've got three discarded not discard me I don't really want to discard these either
you're always good to stand straight right discard for attire
the lovers into a wild card oh my god it's so wild why is the card wild we'll never know
I want to keep that 10 because of that the thing
uh what the fuck am I supposed to play three of a kind
okay
three of a kind speed and then holy shit that's it that's all I can do
I mean it did something something was popping off I don't I don't exactly know what but it was
pop a lock and choose playing cards or choose playing cards
cool house I live for the wild I do love a dapper moustache
noodles yes you are a good little seaweed I love that fucking nickname
let's just get a little seaweed tell you I'm a little seaweed I'll be flowing in the water
sell the first joker and reroll for an uncommon really
fuck it give me an uncommon shit
I would have to completely change up my plan I think it's too late to change a strategy like that
is it too late for fancy pants
it's trusors nope it's worth it trusors works with a full house
right uncommon uncommon uncommon and I can't get rid of that guy because he lets me hold
the or everyone um
put the pants first sorry I always forget that part
uh 7.5 on uncommon isn't bad maybe if we can swap to the two pair angle it's not too bad I
I'm gonna buy
right what are we looking at
chance to win money though
chance to win money or double the point I feel like money because when we reroll
this little guy's getting stronger every time we're gonna next round it first hand is drawn
face down that's fine uh unless that one isn't so we know by rank that we've got pretty low batch
of cards I have four attempts to get 10k
hmm don't buy so many cards a slung deck is more reliable
wait no fuck it hey we got a double in there
okay oh that was such a waste I'm sorry
I've done it now
I've done it now
okay I have a lot of 10s I don't have a lot of 9s 8s I'm waiting on showing up 3 and 2 you
can fuck off while you're at it right what are you bonus cards right that's what I want
7 and 3 you can both perish 10 uh 8th and jack I mean I don't want you to perish but

strats I have fancy pants I need to do him oh I'm so sorry
I don't need triples I need doubles we're going back on the doubles wow I have one discard
uh ace I've got rid of too many you too I've got rid of many
five I'm very likely to show up nine and ten
and queen all equally oh fuck this is a terrible truck oh I paid off though
wait no I didn't yes I did I tell the lie go doubles go multiply do your thing
wow right must remember fancy pants I have fancy pants now
are you guys okay if I go get a snack after we lose this one I need a wee snack
full house was also an option was it okay no was it full house oh yeah yeah yeah
full house would activate two pair anyway okay another uncapped well we can't really
change up anything uh sell this card to create a free double card I don't know what that is
uh no I need the rounds when blind is like no
turret card oh please oh please what's two pair I've forgotten
oh Uranus in you come we're doing two pair strategy we might be able to do it in time
to save the run to swap now would I need delete spades that I don't think anything happens spades
maybe turn turn stuff into spades fuck it turn stuff into spades sure everything comes spades
we're gonna reroll to increase our little buddy there add one stone to deck when blind is selected
one and two chance to create a turret card when any booster pack is open
wow that seems pretty OP but I would lose out on something
yeah I would lose out on a multiplier it's good at the start it's too late now okay agreed agreed
um I'm gonna reroll no I'm not I'm gonna go next shit okay what are you initial cards and
booster packs are free in the next shot ah do we want it no we need to level up pants we need

remember the foodies and what are cull on numbers for life
yes yes yes when i lose endless mode i'll go get some food and we'll all get a cup of tea and uh
uh a bit of food to nibble on and then we'll try a difficult deck because now i think i'm on to like
the hard decks now um you know some people like soft decks uh medium henna decks i prefer uh the
hard decks you know you know so they're quite long because there's a lot of cards in them so they can
be quite long decks of them yeah she'll fuck up just fuck up i'm too hyper playing this game with
you because i'm i'm like oh my god a game that i have to use my head but it's kind of working out
oh yeah oh yeah it's all coming together add a playing card not really interested in that
um played cards with clubs not not we will go away
no go away one more okay i will get her because again i love everything thank you again nero for
the pet i get food i promise i get food once we lose because we're gonna lose i'm going to skip
because it gives us another joker i don't know what it's gonna be but uh i'm excited right i can
only play one hand type
yeah i mean i think i'll win anyway oh i should have thrown away the east because
that would have uh that's a freaking million a million swadrillion dollars
whoa played cards give more get in my belly celesteo pack please get in my belly too
who goes there a straight a four of a kind or a straight flush i guess mars
yay wow constellation now does four
tarot cards peer in the shop more actually i'm not really too fast give me my money back
pyramid right now joker bonus lucky blast lucky i guess
yeah lucky i'll take it okay uh and then one reroll for the level up which is good to go
and then go again once dawn trail hits i'm gonna straight for the
and buy for quick what are you in the wrong chat who are you who are you what
there's buy for there's not buy for questions game now here's the hard part we're gonna get
exponential gain yes another negative oh sorry i'm going for the negative go nope i'm just sharing
my day okay that's different then uh i see a duplicate oh wait sorry and a queen
and just like that win i'll read again
this is outrageous
this is outrageous this is streamer lock i'm sorry there's no way you guys are getting
games like this i refuse to believe it give me the hermit crab hermit card sorry no hermit crab
glass diamond spades right perish i'm not doing that give me my hermit card
oh i was joking but i'll take it oh but planet but money but planet though two planets
increase my multiplier it's 4.2 fine take my money it doesn't matter if it's bad because
even even a okay one reroll to boost my other guy and then let's go again
the mark all face all face cards are drawn
but that doesn't matter because i can't read
am i i think i'm gonna hit this like easy stop i'm still winning
oh my god is this the rush that real gamble people feel
okay we're gonna buy you because i don't mind that i like to leave out sure
tarot celestial
uh urinus and you come
oh we're down 4.5 and then a tarot give me my money back give me the hermit
yes oh no again it makes me make a decision between the planets
ah fine you win just this time
a rush aren't you getting desensitized from all the winning no then you guys like play the same game over
that's not even that's not even a realistic jump in endless mode that's not even realistic
come on seven million yeah i don't think we're hitting those either
that's silly come on that's so silly what i need
i need to throw these away i guess you're such a silly game
um
like you're gonna need to give me something yeah fuck it double my money right now yeah
fuck it give me my money i paid for it go
oh seven million i mean
seven million that's such unfair scaling
they were not messing around being like oh yeah no sorry when we said scale we meant
to kale how are my aces and jacks oh i have like no aces okay get rid of that i have seven kings
i have three jacks a bit unlikely eights i have five sevens i have four four actually i'm not gonna
i've got a pair shout out to all my peers um jack you're giving me a hard time buddy i said
ten i've got four of you nine i've got three of you so you're out
eight i've already got a double of you seven i'd like to hold on to you for a planetarium
i'm out of cards
oh i've done it now i've gone
wow okay it's just an excuse to get food i threw on purpose totally
yeah
brah come on i had six kings sitting what i do throw away a three
and a ten no like the likelihood of me getting something decent is so high the seven i ever
did no like brah fine fuck it play a high card i know you're gonna give me a double
how did i even get anywhere oh for fuck
pain i don't i don't know what to do i mean i've lost i'll just admit it you've lost
no you admit you've lost no fuck you no fuck you wait i don't have any discards left right please
oh nonsense
yeah yeah yeah then you all start trickling in at the same time i get it i get it har har har
very funny yeah you should have showed up earlier we maybe i actually could have won that
yeah yeah yeah defeated by a small blade mobile
play the cards
yeah oh max out the interest per round earning for 10 consecutive raise the cap on interest
earned in each round to 20
what am i gonna do when a run without playing a straight damn straight
when a run on any start run with the crystal ball voucher in two copies of the full wait that's
like so advantageous at the end of each round $2 per hand $1 per discard no interest at all so i
wouldn't actually have to bother with the economy one joker slot but minus a hand start a run
you know what we'll give magic a go how about that right let me go for a pee um can't beat
the peeler allegations honestly um let me go for a tinkle i'm gonna make another cup of tea
i'm gonna get some food and then we'll give this one a shot because right now we have see the uh
this wee poker one two three and then we don't have anything else but that doesn't matter we're
working on it okay it's taking it's it's taking a little bit of time um okay but everyone please go
get food please do stretch please stand up and um we'll give one more run to the magic deck um
and i'll see how i'm feeling because i was up quite late um working on like patreon audio so
yeah uh there's two early access patreons if you're interested it's just early access so you
will get to hear it at a later date but one of them i can't upload until 90 days after my warning
is away because i had the audacity to breathe in the audio and i'm like is this too sensitive for
youtube because youtube and breathing right now is getting a bit silly with asmr i really hope
they actually go back on it but i don't know how likely that is um but yeah
peeler how dare you how dare you i know how dare a woman breathe honestly okay i very quickly go
think i'm gonna uh boil the kettle take me only four minutes and you know i'm taking a minute to
sit down on the toilet do you want do you want to detailed so i sit down on the toilet and i think
about you and i just release and that's disgusting i'm so sorry everything never is not the time for
such um for such nefarious activities okay i'll be back in a minute okay please get some um wee
snacky food or um wheat juice or hydration and make sure you stretch your leg okay rather than
sitting for a whole second i'll be right back
