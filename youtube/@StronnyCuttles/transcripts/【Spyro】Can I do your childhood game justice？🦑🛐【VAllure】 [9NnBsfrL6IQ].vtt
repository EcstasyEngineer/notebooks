WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:02.640
lea wearing the bodyguard

00:24.040 --> 00:27.240
hallo

00:27.240 --> 00:29.240
you hear me get him

00:29.240 --> 00:37.840
Good morning. Good evening. Good afternoon. We just trying not to be so loud for once in

00:37.840 --> 00:45.200
a while. Does your dad use those fancy made up scotch words like gobsheet and bampo? A

00:45.200 --> 00:51.920
wee bit. He's much worse lying than me. Good morning. Good evening. Good afternoon. I'm

00:51.920 --> 01:03.880
trying to be a wee bit quieter. But that's because my dad's here. I'm trying to be so

01:03.880 --> 01:15.120
quiet. I think he's still asleep. So, but I had the worst day ever yesterday. I'm so

01:15.120 --> 01:20.800
sorry I couldn't tell you. I didn't want anyone tracking his flight. I didn't want

01:20.800 --> 01:30.280
any weirdness. So my dad's here. I was violently car sick yesterday. So I feel awful. I've

01:30.280 --> 01:35.440
had five hours sleep. I didn't have my nap. I don't even know if I've had five hours straight

01:35.440 --> 01:40.440
to be honest. But we're gonna we're gonna figure out this game one way or another. So this

01:40.440 --> 01:49.400
is Spyro, which may or may not be your childhood game. Because it's not mine. It's still my

01:49.480 --> 01:59.480
game. My master. No, I've not played it before. So Crash Bandicoot got remastered and so did

01:59.480 --> 02:04.720
Spyro. So I don't know if it's the same studio or if it was just rival studios that were

02:04.720 --> 02:09.360
smart enough to re-release classic games. Like if they re-release cameo. So I'm jumping

02:09.360 --> 02:16.360
right back on that. Thank you for streaming despite being a game, but also self care one.

02:16.360 --> 02:26.200
Well, I have, I don't know what we're gonna do about ASMR streams because so my dad passed

02:26.200 --> 02:34.800
out and he's got his own room in over him. And his snoring is so loud. I don't think I

02:34.800 --> 02:43.840
can do ASMR for the next three weeks. I'm really unsure what's gonna happen. I beat the second

02:44.000 --> 02:50.000
Spyro over at my best friend's house. I'm surprised you never played this. I don't know if Spyro

02:50.000 --> 02:58.600
came out after, I mean before Crash Bandicoot. There we go. I have no idea. No dad snoring

02:58.600 --> 03:04.120
ASMR. Oh, he like proper snores the house then. The bloody cats are scared of him. Gimli

03:04.120 --> 03:13.280
and Vigo didn't come out. But yeah, I'm so sorry for the entire, we're gonna give Spyro

03:13.360 --> 03:23.360
a shot. I assume it's Spyro the dragon I'm supposed to do, right? Yeah, seems right. That

03:23.360 --> 03:30.280
was fine. 100% question mark. They need to get used to them. Yeah, they do not. Gimli

03:30.280 --> 03:32.080
and Vigo. Oh my god, they have cutscenes.

03:32.080 --> 03:42.640
Okay, rolling. Oh, it's been peaceful here in the five worlds, or is it six? For a dragon

03:42.640 --> 03:51.280
to eat, you now have 12,000 treasure, or is it 14,000? What about this Ganasty Gannok

03:51.280 --> 03:58.240
character? Now, I'm a Ganasty magic spell to turn gems into warriors for his cause. I'll

03:59.040 --> 04:12.400
gentle confirmed. Wait. So yeah, I'm gonna give your childhood game a shot. See what I think,

04:12.400 --> 04:16.640
because I share my childhood game all the time, so it's time for me to play a new game.

04:17.360 --> 04:30.320
Wait, they have old music. Wait, why didn't... Oh, he talks.

04:36.880 --> 04:38.400
Wait, why didn't he make me green?

04:38.720 --> 04:46.320
Is this a remake of the original Spyro? It is.

04:54.160 --> 05:00.800
So X is charged, B is flamed. Is it unlimited? I don't really see a bar. What's Y?

05:01.040 --> 05:08.320
What's Y? X at look. Hold on, sorry. Wait, right trigger is attack as well.

05:10.800 --> 05:17.280
What's this? Rescued nest. I didn't do anything. I walked forward, sir. Please,

05:17.280 --> 05:19.680
please do not give me more accolades for things I didn't do.

05:23.680 --> 05:29.040
Oh my god. Thank you, hit Vocaloid, Iniku Hatsune, for becoming a member.

05:31.760 --> 05:37.840
What about NastyNork? I'm going after him. I'm going to find dragons first.

05:37.840 --> 05:40.560
That's all I can tell you. Right, we're to find dragons.

05:42.720 --> 05:48.400
I mean, I think it's as simple as that. I'm going to say no. Right, there's a green one over there.

05:48.400 --> 05:56.400
Oh, I can fly with wings. Delvin. That Miku? Oh my god, she literally...

05:56.400 --> 06:01.600
NastyNork out towards you. Keep your horns on, Spyro. You have much to learn.

06:01.600 --> 06:05.440
So I'm a baby dragon. Do you know what the dragon fly following you is doing?

06:07.120 --> 06:13.440
His name is Sparks and he's helping me protect you. Keep an eye on him and see what I mean.

06:14.000 --> 06:17.520
Please... where is this?

06:19.840 --> 06:20.640
Oh, I missed.

06:27.760 --> 06:32.480
Wait, I can't touch water? Is it because I'm a dragon?

06:33.120 --> 06:46.160
Okay, sorry, I'm just getting used to this. I've almost perished because I'm a dumber.

06:47.920 --> 06:51.920
Oh, I'm locked to place. Do I want to go there? Does it matter where you go?

06:53.360 --> 06:57.760
I do see portals going out and Joes don't read your health.

06:58.480 --> 07:00.880
Oh, he looks so messed up.

07:02.400 --> 07:06.000
Old video games and conditions to expect water to always be lethal.

07:06.000 --> 07:12.000
Literally, I didn't realize I was hurting myself. That was a bit of an oversight from me.

07:14.080 --> 07:19.680
Oh, I've got my cup of tea. Treasure found. Oh no, is this like 100% the game to progress?

07:19.680 --> 07:23.120
Or is it just... you can go wherever you want. Oh, okay.

07:27.840 --> 07:32.000
But yeah, how are you guys? Other than... oh my god, what?

07:34.560 --> 07:37.520
Are you squid merit? I've just come for the worst, like one.

07:37.520 --> 07:40.960
Mama dipping into my childhood on my 24th birthday.

07:40.960 --> 07:41.520
Oh, birthday.

07:41.520 --> 07:44.640
Best present ever. I hope you have a fun.

07:44.640 --> 07:47.760
Oh my god, happy 24th birthday.

07:47.760 --> 07:51.680
Snowberry smoothie. That's such a cute name. Thank you for the 20 as well.

07:51.680 --> 07:56.240
Yeah, I'm trying to play your childhood games. Oh no, the controls are embedded.

07:56.320 --> 07:59.600
I assume I go for the barrels, right? Oh gosh.

08:00.560 --> 08:04.080
All right. No, okay, okay. I thought we were gonna like lose momentum or something,

08:04.080 --> 08:05.600
but I'm gonna just follow the rail track.

08:11.200 --> 08:16.400
But yeah, basically, I cannot travel at all. I don't know what I'm gonna do.

08:18.560 --> 08:23.440
Because I'm memeing about this convention and stuff,

08:23.520 --> 08:26.560
and I could hardly be in a flipping taxi.

08:28.080 --> 08:32.480
Get right. Oh my god, I'm actually so smart with a heck. I love kids games.

08:32.480 --> 08:34.640
I love games that are really obvious what you're supposed to do.

08:35.840 --> 08:38.000
I don't know what the heck this is, but I did spot it.

08:42.000 --> 08:50.720
Plus three. Time? Oh, I need it for something? Time's up. Would you like to retry?

08:54.160 --> 09:02.960
Huh? I'm to do eight planes, eight chests, eight trains, and eight arches.

09:07.120 --> 09:07.760
Is that not?

09:09.600 --> 09:13.200
Have I just picked the hardest mission to start on? Actually, if actually.

09:17.200 --> 09:18.560
I see a chest this time.

09:18.560 --> 09:24.960
Oh, I'm on the floor. Oh, indeed.

09:26.960 --> 09:30.080
Okay, I'm up to something else. I don't think I'm supposed to do that one first.

09:30.720 --> 09:33.440
You have to get all of the things before the time runs out.

09:38.320 --> 09:41.120
Right, we're not doing any flight missions. I said what I said.

09:41.120 --> 09:43.600
Oh, but my health is regen. Doesn't even do anything for that.

09:44.160 --> 09:46.400
Okay, what are you smelling?

09:48.800 --> 09:49.600
What does he do?

09:50.480 --> 09:57.840
Getting around him. That doesn't seem like a nice thing to do, but oh, they're scared of me.

09:59.360 --> 10:01.200
Okay, we'll take it.

10:05.760 --> 10:08.560
Getting things gives you time back though. Oh, okay.

10:09.520 --> 10:14.320
Okay, let's try whatever this mission is. I'm so sorry. I really don't...

10:15.680 --> 10:20.400
I don't... I don't play this game. Hopefully I do it justice.

10:20.400 --> 10:27.840
And yeah, and I don't sound too sick. I had to take quills, which is anti-sickness medicine,

10:28.720 --> 10:32.560
and it takes away all the saliva in your mouth, and it's still in effect right now.

10:32.560 --> 10:39.520
I think it ages ago. And my mouth is all dry, and my voice is all cracked because I was talking to

10:39.520 --> 10:47.840
my dad, but my freaking throat was so dry, so I completely messed up.

10:49.840 --> 10:52.080
But I've got to see my dad at the airport.

10:53.520 --> 10:56.240
Oh my god, the poor taxi driver. He had to stop for me twice.

10:56.240 --> 10:59.120
That ram looks so menacing in the distance right now.

11:02.640 --> 11:04.960
Yes, I'm drinking it. I'm gonna see if I can finish my tea.

11:09.280 --> 11:14.480
My freaking thigh. Oh, that was quite the voice crack if you heard that.

11:15.120 --> 11:20.880
And my freaking... I was like gagging and throwing up. I had to ask the poor taxi man to

11:22.000 --> 11:28.160
go to the side of the road for me. I had to... I was like begging him to put the window down on that,

11:28.160 --> 11:32.160
and I almost threw it outside the car, like down the side of the freaking thing.

11:32.880 --> 11:38.480
I have really bad car sickness. It's literally my biggest weakness, you know.

11:38.480 --> 11:42.720
You guys are like, oh, Strony. Oh my god, hi, little fly.

11:44.480 --> 11:49.040
Strony, how do you stream every single day? That's not possible. Oh, you're so strong.

11:49.040 --> 11:55.760
You're so brave. No, my biggest weakness is cars. I can't be in cars. I can't be in buses.

11:56.480 --> 11:58.640
I have been on a boat and not had any issues.

12:01.120 --> 12:07.040
They had to nerf me somewhere in its cars. You know how the world relies on transport

12:07.040 --> 12:12.400
to get anywhere, and I just use my bike to go to the shops. Yeah, there's a reason why I'm not

12:12.400 --> 12:17.200
interested. Although, I read things that said if you get motion sickness in cars, but if you're the

12:17.200 --> 12:25.600
driver, you don't get the same motion sickness. I literally watch me go to a convention in a

12:25.600 --> 12:29.920
America and be like, right, that's me heading off now. And it's like four weeks before. And

12:29.920 --> 12:32.480
everyone's like, what the fuck? And it's because I have to get a fucking boat.

12:35.760 --> 12:40.560
The mobility buff is strong. Literally, I can hardly even leave the damn house.

12:44.000 --> 12:50.240
Oh, okay. You threw up four, oh, four times in the car.

12:50.880 --> 12:57.280
Fuck you. I can ram you too. Hold on. Gen two ram girl confirmed.

13:01.280 --> 13:05.040
Just head on collision. Oh, sorry, the camera's a bit funky.

13:05.760 --> 13:10.720
Try to get used to it. There's a camera just to when I move. No, you have to constantly do the

13:10.800 --> 13:13.120
right except one is speed up.

13:18.240 --> 13:21.200
Right, you and you. What's this?

13:25.600 --> 13:26.080
Dragon.

13:28.480 --> 13:32.160
Rescued Gildas. Hello. Oh, you're a painter.

13:35.040 --> 13:35.600
Go for it.

13:40.720 --> 13:44.000
And try pressing the action button to drop down midflying.

13:45.440 --> 13:52.800
Listen, Glading just bad flying. What's this? Can you like 100% this game? Oh, why did you spank me?

13:54.000 --> 13:59.200
Well, this, if he's telling me about Glading, I assume there's another dragon somewhere here.

14:02.320 --> 14:09.600
It's just a, I have about a 3D with girl for gen two. That is terrible. I really want to develop

14:09.600 --> 14:19.600
a legion, like a Roman legionary. Okay. What are these? Hello. Do you have coins inside you?

14:23.840 --> 14:32.000
Have to do them. Oh, wait, it's out of bounds. This is out of bounds, I think. Okay, sorry.

14:32.800 --> 14:36.320
I'm being a dumb dumb. What are you?

14:38.320 --> 14:42.560
Are you running away from me? Nice try. Wait, he's actually kind of fast.

14:45.280 --> 14:49.440
Wait, he's got an egg on him. Can I birth more dragons?

14:51.200 --> 14:54.880
I will single handedly rise the dragon population.

14:55.680 --> 15:03.680
Okay, I can cut corners. Oh, we're getting closer. I actually caught a few more corners and he's done for it.

15:09.760 --> 15:16.560
I've got a special egg. What did that do? Torches as the egg thieves. Did he steal from us?

15:17.440 --> 15:19.920
That's a jam right here.

15:23.280 --> 15:29.280
I can climb. I think I can climb. I don't know if I'm supposed to climb or not.

15:35.680 --> 15:40.960
I could, I don't know if I could produce dragons. That's quite a tall order.

15:41.680 --> 15:46.480
You order. I don't know if you guys are in TikTok but there's this Scottish TikTok

15:47.520 --> 15:53.200
like Chinese takeaway and she's like, it's called like Rebecca Box or whatever and it's like,

15:53.200 --> 16:00.560
let's pack this customer's order. But she goes like genuinely, goes like order with her voice

16:00.560 --> 16:05.760
and it just reminds me of when I say wild guard. There'll be like one person that knows exactly

16:05.760 --> 16:09.520
what I'm talking about and everyone else is like, what are you on about, strongy? I swear.

16:11.840 --> 16:16.640
We don't need chess. Okay, wait, how many dragons are there per level?

16:17.200 --> 16:19.280
Asked or? Do you like the intro?

16:20.560 --> 16:26.000
After you freeze all the dragons, the book will fry. Maybe a dragon girl would be fun for them too.

16:27.040 --> 16:32.800
Wouldn't that be adorable? Wouldn't she be just the cute little bunny?

16:33.520 --> 16:44.560
Anyway, I did not listen to what that was meant to. I think she's healing me when she does that.

16:45.200 --> 16:49.520
Generally, three or four, the men you should tell you. Oh, if I press start.

16:50.240 --> 16:54.880
Okay, okay, so there's two more dragons. We're gonna go this way then because we're not

16:54.960 --> 16:57.760
going this way. I think I spawned here. Excuse me. Thank you.

17:00.400 --> 17:06.080
Okay, stop. I actually love how simple this game is. I actually am enjoying it very much.

17:07.040 --> 17:12.080
I'm so sorry if I don't fit something very enthusiastic today. I'm one tired baby.

17:12.080 --> 17:17.680
I was hanging about at the airport for ages. My dad said his luggage just wasn't coming,

17:18.640 --> 17:25.840
but I did it. What? I can't break titanium. Oh, come on.

17:27.920 --> 17:30.560
Pardon me. How strong are my horns if I can do that?

17:33.760 --> 17:37.760
These games in my childhood, two and three are so much better though. Oh no, I picked the worst one.

17:38.800 --> 17:46.320
As your dad doing, he never slept for like 48 hours. He did not see a bed, so he's had better days.

17:47.280 --> 17:54.320
No way. No way. I perfectly fucking had the gamer sense to know where the heck this dragon is.

17:55.920 --> 18:01.200
You are a dragon and you're very strong. It's good to start here, but to his best.

18:04.000 --> 18:06.480
The others just add a lot more elements to them.

18:07.440 --> 18:14.320
What? Does he sound like the perfect old weeb? Oh, sure.

18:16.480 --> 18:21.200
Okay, thank you for releasing this though. Right, so exit level and we get to keep everything?

18:24.880 --> 18:27.920
I assume we get to keep everything. It's not like one of those games.

18:28.880 --> 18:33.840
Returning to artisan.

18:37.760 --> 18:39.360
Yes. Okay, it did let me keep it.

18:42.640 --> 18:46.960
Oh, sorry. Excuse me. Pardon me. Come through. I just need a portal. That's all.

18:47.840 --> 18:52.880
Let's stay. Oh, I'm scared to do any flight stuff though. It's like a flight mission,

18:52.880 --> 18:56.400
so as I'll come back later, mate, I'm no interested right now. I'm too rubbish at it.

18:58.160 --> 19:04.000
Was there a portal over here? You missed the gem. It didn't save the gem.

19:06.640 --> 19:11.840
You need to collect gems if you want to do 100%? I've got a life for doing that.

19:14.000 --> 19:16.160
The dark hollow. Ooh, the haunted.

19:18.880 --> 19:23.200
But I have no idea how long we're going to play for actually. He should be waking up soon,

19:23.200 --> 19:27.440
if I'm being honest. I'm trying to be quiet. I don't want to wake because he was like,

19:27.440 --> 19:30.480
oh, you're not going to be that loud when you play games, are you? And I'm like,

19:32.240 --> 19:34.320
you're joking, right? I'll be screaming down the mic.

19:37.920 --> 19:42.800
But yes, when she becomes up, I think I'll redirect into her. I have no idea how long

19:42.800 --> 19:49.440
this game takes to finish. They're attacking me. No, you're not supposed to actually attack me.

19:49.440 --> 19:58.560
Right, we need three dragons. There's three frogs. Oh, wait, the frogs are healing up my dragonfly?

19:59.440 --> 20:05.280
Oh, the dragonfly's eating the boos. Oh, wait.

20:10.160 --> 20:12.960
Oh, sorry, I love the combat because it's so easy.

20:13.200 --> 20:18.960
How many hits can I take in a really quick few?

20:25.600 --> 20:31.440
Okay, oh, there's a dragon here. Darius. Four hits and I'm out.

20:33.840 --> 20:38.880
I pray that your dad's a deep sleeper. Well, I don't know if we can do ASMR streams and I'm like,

20:38.960 --> 20:44.640
oh my god, three weeks? No ASMR stream seems bizarre because literally it's my main focus.

20:46.080 --> 20:51.680
I have entered the battle zone. Oh, yes, hell come here. Okay, feed drags. Okay, drags is back to being

20:51.680 --> 21:05.520
focused. If we do end up doing no ASMR streams for three weeks, I pinky promise I will make

21:05.760 --> 21:11.920
no, don't return home. I don't even got the other dragons yet. I pinky promise I will do like,

21:11.920 --> 21:15.040
I'll shut you not like, back to back ASMR stream type stuff.

21:18.320 --> 21:26.640
Neat glide from up here. You light the campfire.

21:27.600 --> 21:31.440
Oh, we flings, we're camping.

21:33.440 --> 21:38.880
Ew, that's so cute. I prefer when you play games though. Oh, I think,

21:40.000 --> 21:43.760
I know everyone's got their, oh my god, I'm actually so smart for figuring that out.

21:46.320 --> 21:52.480
Oh, life. The only time I can get a life is in video games, swing school.

21:53.440 --> 22:00.400
Oh, I don't think I've been done this way. Nope. We'll do fine. We'll cry, but we'll do fine.

22:00.960 --> 22:03.680
Oh, okay, again, right. So the big guy is fire.

22:07.200 --> 22:12.480
Sorry, I'm trying to get used to this. Whoa, what? Can I only get his buff?

22:15.440 --> 22:20.480
Oh no. Oh, I'm getting scared. Stop, stop. I'm actually scared. That scared me. Please don't do

22:20.480 --> 22:26.880
that again. Put him away, yeah, man. Honestly, just a moment. I'm not doing it.

22:33.040 --> 22:35.840
All right, you do it. He's smart too. I forgot that part. Stop.

22:41.840 --> 22:46.320
Why does he have such a generic like spiral? Whoa, there's a key.

22:47.280 --> 22:49.920
Okay, Reefling, it's time to lock up and give me,

22:51.520 --> 22:54.880
I'm just the key dude. Must unlock his secret door.

22:57.840 --> 23:01.360
I'm looking at the map. I don't know where my last dragon is.

23:07.760 --> 23:14.800
He's like, hardly patrolling. Yeah. Does he even care?

23:16.800 --> 23:23.280
Okay, geez. That was like so hard to grab him.

23:26.560 --> 23:35.120
Aspire was a generic 90s teenager. Oh yeah, right. I'm on it. Like that's what I'm getting from him.

23:36.160 --> 23:41.280
Can't flea mill, can't ram big. Grilled his butt. That was my only option. Oh, it's never going up.

23:42.240 --> 23:43.920
He must be up there, head over here.

23:45.600 --> 23:46.880
Hominah, hominah, hominah, hominah.

23:49.760 --> 23:50.880
Oh, it has a key.

23:54.080 --> 23:59.920
Oh, this is like such a polite little game. Okay, we can fire that one.

24:01.440 --> 24:07.200
Okay, sorry, but this game is actually so fair. I love it. I just think I'm just going to be a

24:07.200 --> 24:12.000
professional child's game like reviewer and stuff. It's because I suck at games.

24:15.360 --> 24:16.880
Whoa, the Spiral Vs.

24:22.080 --> 24:23.600
Taken over the mic? Well.

24:28.720 --> 24:34.160
I like how the dragons are actually tutorials as well. That's so nice. I like it.

24:34.640 --> 24:42.880
Okay, so if I, I'm not to leave, I'm to use the portal, which is over here.

24:44.800 --> 24:48.400
Aspire's speedruns are quite the experience. Oh, we're in speedrunning.

24:50.320 --> 24:57.040
I'm just going to try and collect as many dragons as I can before I go offline.

24:57.040 --> 24:59.760
I'm going to have to definitely change up some of my schedule though.

25:04.320 --> 25:11.040
Uh, I like how cute the game is. I don't know how easy it is to 100% with the gems or whatever.

25:11.920 --> 25:18.080
Actually, it wouldn't be impossible. All right, we'll have with them. Right, I'm not

25:18.080 --> 25:21.280
doing the fine mission because it sucks, so there must be another mission. You know,

25:21.280 --> 25:25.360
something about this castle up here? Ah, the platform's here.

25:27.840 --> 25:31.360
You're perfectly qualified for video game journalism then, and ironically,

25:32.320 --> 25:33.680
what's this? Hello.

25:36.000 --> 25:40.320
Knock, knock. I'm Spyro. Please let me in. Is that like the end of it?

25:43.440 --> 25:46.800
Hmm, we did the haunted mansion. We did that one. I don't know what this one is.

25:49.280 --> 25:51.200
Most of the gems are just hanging out in the world.

25:51.440 --> 26:01.440
Oh. Resued Thomas. Congrats if your name's Thomas. I'll try and talk to you later, Thomas.

26:15.120 --> 26:18.960
Oh, man. Yeah, of course. Thanks for the advice.

26:19.520 --> 26:22.720
Stop. You're so generic. I love them.

26:26.080 --> 26:29.280
Turn square. Oh yeah, we're going to civilization.

26:31.920 --> 26:41.600
Hmm. Yeah, I was really sick. I had to go to a bakery at the airport. I paid $5.50 for a tiny

26:41.680 --> 26:51.040
little lemonade bottle, and I had to get a sick bag off of her. I was like, I'm so sorry to ask,

26:51.600 --> 26:56.880
but do you sell plastic bags at all? And she was like, I'm so sorry, I don't. And I was like,

26:56.880 --> 27:01.440
do you, is it okay if I can buy a little paper bag off of you because I needed something to

27:01.440 --> 27:07.600
be sick in in case I was sick on the way back? And she was like, oh no, it's fine. You can just

27:07.600 --> 27:12.800
have it for free, darling. I think she could see I was like sick as fuck whilst I'm waiting for my

27:12.800 --> 27:20.240
freaking dad. The same voice actor as SpongeBob. That's fantastic. Welcome to Town Square. None of

27:20.240 --> 27:30.400
the dragons are re... None of the dragons are being reused. Like, they're all designed new. This is

27:30.400 --> 27:37.520
so good. Okay, right. I assume I rammed them from behind. Oh no, I can burn them as well.

27:40.320 --> 27:46.720
Uh, jump. I can't imagine paying for a bag like that. Well, in Scotland, you have to pay for any

27:46.720 --> 27:58.560
bags you take away. Want me to ram it and jump? Okay. And like, I don't want to get in trouble or

27:58.560 --> 28:04.960
anything for doing, like, for not thinking. So I was just like, oh, can I pay for these? She was

28:04.960 --> 28:12.640
like, nah, just take it for free. You already got scum assed on the lemonade. Like, when you risk

28:12.640 --> 28:21.360
you all doing empire. You do. So in Scotland, it's set up, you have to pay for like those takeaway bags

28:21.360 --> 28:26.400
from any shop or whatever. And it's supposed to go to charity, but obviously it started it,

28:26.400 --> 28:30.640
there were gonna be five pence, but then it's obviously changed to whatever the fuck they

28:30.640 --> 28:37.280
want to charge because they make a profit on that, you know. I assume if I get a hundred gems.

28:42.560 --> 28:44.000
Oh, I just made him perish.

28:44.640 --> 28:56.800
The odd thing is that this is how the OG game looks in my memory. I'm always like that with

28:56.800 --> 29:01.840
video games. Like, when I played Brotherhood, I was like, oh my god, this game's aged a little bit.

29:01.840 --> 29:07.280
Like, just go to the graphics and stuff. And I was like, wait, I don't remember like Brotherhood

29:07.280 --> 29:13.680
being the most top notch thing I've ever seen in my life. You're using your gamer

29:13.760 --> 29:15.040
instincts. I mean, it's winning.

29:21.040 --> 29:25.920
The egg. Uh, that would be me. If I was a dragon, I'm like, oh, I'm winded me.

29:26.720 --> 29:32.000
I think there is a guy back here, but I don't know how to get there. No, I don't want to jump

29:32.000 --> 29:44.160
back down. Well, it's more than 10 years old now at the time. It was so good.

29:46.800 --> 29:53.520
So red. Hold on. I'm really struggling with the camera angle from being honest. I don't know.

29:53.520 --> 29:57.440
I don't know if it's janky for you guys, but I had to get up there.

29:58.400 --> 30:04.160
I don't claim on the phone. What? I don't claim on the phone.

30:11.200 --> 30:16.640
Huh. Hold on. Let's just have the camera's wear back in the day.

30:16.960 --> 30:30.640
Can I jump up in the very far now? No. Hmm. My gamer senses. Oh, no. What?

30:32.720 --> 30:37.760
The game wouldn't force you to restart a mission if you're not complete it. How many

30:37.760 --> 30:39.200
have I got? Yeah, I'm missing a dragon.

30:45.840 --> 30:47.360
You had the right idea of gliding.

30:51.520 --> 30:54.000
I didn't see platform that I'm supposed to go on though.

30:58.560 --> 31:01.520
When you hear an an an an an, it means there's an egg thief nearby.

31:02.400 --> 31:09.760
Sorry. Glide from the top of the stairs to the egg thief.

31:11.760 --> 31:16.640
This can't be. No. Oh, wait. Maybe it was. Hold on a minute. Hold on a minute,

31:16.640 --> 31:19.760
Riefling. So you actually are so right. Hold on.

31:22.880 --> 31:25.840
Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. I just need to give it a really hard turn.

31:26.480 --> 31:31.760
I don't know how you're supposed to figure this stuff out on your own child's game,

31:31.760 --> 31:38.400
by the way. Oh, we did it. Glade to the secret egg thief in the town square. Okay, I can do that.

31:40.000 --> 31:49.920
Where is he? He can jump. I'm gonna make him jump. Did it make me jump down?

31:50.240 --> 31:51.920
It did. I need to go all the way back.

31:55.440 --> 31:57.920
Yeah, I definitely can't reach that. Okay.

31:59.840 --> 32:06.400
As if I missed it. How embarrassing. Anyone remember the live-action commercials of the

32:06.400 --> 32:12.880
creepy sheep protesting this game? Someone protested Spyro before.

32:12.960 --> 32:19.600
Backseat successful. Yes, you're more than welcome to backseat me. I have absolutely

32:19.600 --> 32:23.680
no issues with it. I am but a humble crybaby colfish.

32:26.240 --> 32:29.920
I don't know what I'm doing and I'm more than happy to be told what to do.

32:31.440 --> 32:33.680
And no, do not add like a good girl at the end of that.

32:34.080 --> 32:38.000
Okay, we did it.

32:42.320 --> 32:44.640
It's quick, so that's fine. You're the clunk, clunk, clunk.

32:48.320 --> 32:48.800
Sorry.

32:56.800 --> 32:58.560
The back door is back on the main.

32:58.560 --> 33:05.120
This Skyrim commercials had the cheap protests and oh the sheep

33:05.120 --> 33:08.400
protests in the game because you hurt the sheep to get your HP back.

33:10.800 --> 33:15.680
I haven't developed the urge to click gems on site. I don't know. You guys said it's easy,

33:15.680 --> 33:20.560
but I don't trust myself that it's actually easy. Yet.

33:24.720 --> 33:28.480
I'm not looking forward to this flight mission, but I think it's the only one we've not done yet.

33:28.880 --> 33:33.120
Wait, is the game seriously over after the flight mission? Can I be?

33:37.520 --> 33:38.160
Can I be?

33:44.080 --> 33:46.160
All right, I think it is the flight mission time.

33:48.800 --> 33:51.760
No, it's not over. The hot air balloon takes you to a new world.

33:52.720 --> 33:57.680
I hope you hurt my destiny.

33:57.680 --> 33:59.600
Right, we'll give this place a shot again.

33:59.600 --> 34:02.160
If we don't get anywhere, we'll go speak to the hot, I'm sorry,

34:02.160 --> 34:03.760
we'll go speak to the hot balloon guy.

34:04.960 --> 34:07.280
I'm sorry, little sprax.

34:08.080 --> 34:12.720
There are five flight missions, one in the world. I've got another five worlds.

34:15.600 --> 34:19.520
The only legitimate challenger in the first fire games are the flight missions.

34:19.520 --> 34:21.840
The bosses aren't even responsible.

34:25.200 --> 34:26.400
There are, right.

34:29.040 --> 34:32.720
Oh, I did. Oh, okay. You didn't see that. You honestly didn't see that.

34:32.720 --> 34:34.160
How about we just go to the next world?

34:34.160 --> 34:36.800
Yeah, I agree. We should just go to the next world.

34:36.800 --> 34:40.160
A freaking priced X thinking it was going to flamethrower.

34:40.160 --> 34:41.040
I'm so sorry.

34:42.160 --> 34:44.480
I was so freaking sorry. That was so bad.

34:44.480 --> 34:46.320
I'm actually so embarrassed. I don't want to do that.

34:46.960 --> 34:49.840
Do you hear me? Do you spank me with a heel?

34:49.840 --> 34:51.360
No, you don't. I don't know what you do.

34:51.360 --> 34:53.040
Right, no one saw that.

34:53.040 --> 34:54.800
We're just going to move on to the next world

34:54.800 --> 34:57.760
and because we've totally done all the missions in this one.

34:58.320 --> 34:59.840
I missed our hot air balloon guy.

34:59.840 --> 35:03.520
Hello. Wow, I see you.

35:03.520 --> 35:07.120
I see you've been busy rescuing dragon Spyro.

35:07.120 --> 35:08.000
Yes.

35:08.000 --> 35:11.440
You may travel to the peacekeepers world if you like.

35:11.440 --> 35:12.880
Are you ready to go?

35:12.880 --> 35:13.600
Yeah, let's go.

35:16.720 --> 35:18.240
The fairies just to check point.

35:18.240 --> 35:18.800
Flight mission.

35:18.800 --> 35:22.080
What flight mission literally starts the flight mission

35:22.080 --> 35:23.200
instantly goes on the water?

35:23.200 --> 35:24.080
Yeah, all right then.

35:24.080 --> 35:25.840
Okay, talk about MLG Pro.

35:27.280 --> 35:28.960
The flight missions are optional.

35:28.960 --> 35:30.560
Oh, the developers.

35:30.560 --> 35:37.280
I could spiral developer team.

35:37.280 --> 35:39.360
Thank you for letting me skip the flight mission.

35:40.720 --> 35:42.800
I didn't see a dragon.

35:42.800 --> 35:44.240
Okay, let's see this new area.

35:46.640 --> 35:48.960
What? Hello.

35:49.920 --> 35:50.800
I hear an enemy.

35:52.400 --> 35:52.880
Titan.

35:54.560 --> 35:55.680
Those devs owe me.

35:57.120 --> 35:58.720
Wow, what an interesting color scheme.

36:07.120 --> 36:09.120
Wait, I guess because they're dragons,

36:09.120 --> 36:12.640
they won their money.

36:12.640 --> 36:15.760
Oh, here he is.

36:16.640 --> 36:17.760
Here's cannon.

36:17.760 --> 36:19.280
I'm just a wee dragon.

36:19.280 --> 36:21.040
Why are you cannonballing me?

36:21.040 --> 36:22.320
Why are you shooting me?

36:23.120 --> 36:24.960
That's really, I'm just a wee dragon.

36:24.960 --> 36:26.080
Right, dry canyon.

36:27.360 --> 36:28.800
Don't say it, don't say it, don't say it.

36:32.240 --> 36:34.320
Can't wait to see your reaction to a boss.

36:34.320 --> 36:35.200
You will laugh.

36:35.360 --> 36:43.360
You gotta do some yard work.

36:43.360 --> 36:45.520
Oh, you can move in the little wooden thing.

36:47.440 --> 36:49.600
You skip the boss level for the art level.

36:50.240 --> 36:51.680
Is that what was behind the door?

36:52.400 --> 36:53.680
How did I get through the door?

36:56.400 --> 36:59.040
You didn't say it, but I thought it though.

36:59.040 --> 37:02.080
Oh, funny.

37:02.080 --> 37:02.720
I'm sorry.

37:02.720 --> 37:04.480
And Kana needs you to eat that.

37:07.200 --> 37:08.880
Oh, I didn't mean to do that to the other one.

37:10.240 --> 37:13.120
That's this knock knock.

37:13.120 --> 37:13.600
Okay.

37:20.480 --> 37:23.680
Oh, can I just go?

37:23.680 --> 37:25.840
I'm just going to send it by the pope.

37:26.400 --> 37:29.600
I just checked the price for the triology too expensive.

37:29.600 --> 37:31.600
I'd rather just spend money on one.

37:33.200 --> 37:35.040
You know you're allowed to treat yourself right.

37:35.040 --> 37:36.800
Thank you so much, bully legend.

37:39.760 --> 37:40.720
Oh, I missed.

37:40.720 --> 37:41.200
Sorry.

37:43.920 --> 37:45.920
Can I go the opposite way that he goes?

37:45.920 --> 37:46.880
Oh, well, I got him.

37:46.880 --> 37:48.720
I was going to say, can I go the opposite way he goes?

37:48.720 --> 37:49.680
So I can't interact him.

37:51.360 --> 37:54.640
What do you do other than get in my way?

37:54.640 --> 37:55.520
Oh, he's going to shoot him.

38:01.120 --> 38:02.160
Rescued coin.

38:03.280 --> 38:05.600
Thank you again for the super chat, bully legend.

38:06.240 --> 38:08.080
It's 12 bucks on steam.

38:08.080 --> 38:09.760
You can, but he'll turn.

38:09.760 --> 38:10.880
He'll run the other way.

38:11.920 --> 38:13.280
I cannot believe.

38:14.160 --> 38:15.200
Oh, that was water.

38:15.200 --> 38:15.520
Sorry.

38:15.520 --> 38:16.320
I never even saw that.

38:16.320 --> 38:17.680
I was too busy focused on the guy.

38:20.160 --> 38:22.080
I got an achievement for charging a vulture.

38:22.800 --> 38:24.320
Sorry, you can't ram big guys.

38:25.360 --> 38:26.240
But I can try.

38:27.120 --> 38:27.840
Come here, everyone.

38:31.600 --> 38:33.120
How many dragons are on this level?

38:33.120 --> 38:35.040
There are four dragons on the, oh,

38:35.040 --> 38:37.360
there are two more dragons to collect on this level.

38:39.040 --> 38:40.320
It says it's 40 bucks for me.

38:47.280 --> 38:47.840
Yeah, yeah.

38:51.520 --> 38:53.200
Oh my god, I love the dialogue.

38:53.200 --> 38:54.960
I was born to glide.

38:56.560 --> 38:58.160
I love you, Spyro.

38:59.360 --> 39:00.400
This game is so cute.

39:03.440 --> 39:04.720
No, no, no, don't shoot.

39:04.720 --> 39:05.360
Oh, sorry.

39:05.360 --> 39:05.920
Wait, hold on.

39:06.480 --> 39:06.800
Yay.

39:08.880 --> 39:09.840
Oh, sorry.

39:09.840 --> 39:12.160
I keep forgetting and then jumping.

39:12.160 --> 39:14.960
Ah, oh, don't glade.

39:15.520 --> 39:16.240
Glade where?

39:18.880 --> 39:20.640
That wasn't rewarded for glading.

39:20.640 --> 39:21.120
Oh.

39:23.600 --> 39:24.160
My neck.

39:25.280 --> 39:26.480
Oh, thank you for the read.

39:27.200 --> 39:27.840
Kylie won.

39:28.960 --> 39:30.400
I'm praying I'm sorry.

39:30.400 --> 39:31.040
Thank you for the read.

39:31.040 --> 39:31.760
I appreciate that.

39:31.760 --> 39:32.160
Hi.

39:33.200 --> 39:34.400
By the Pope, who was there?

39:35.280 --> 39:36.800
I'm playing Spyro.

39:36.800 --> 39:38.480
It's not my childhood game.

39:38.480 --> 39:39.840
It's your childhood game.

39:39.840 --> 39:40.880
And I don't know what I'm doing.

39:40.880 --> 39:43.120
So I'm so sorry for the gameplay if it's frustrating.

39:43.120 --> 39:44.000
But hi, readers.

39:44.560 --> 39:50.400
I'm Strony Quotles from Motherfucking Vela, Gen 1.

39:50.960 --> 39:51.520
Indulge.

39:52.320 --> 39:52.640
Get it?

39:52.640 --> 39:55.200
It's a big pun because you're supposed to indulge in us.

39:57.600 --> 39:59.520
Who came up with this stuff?

39:59.520 --> 40:00.560
Honestly, it was me.

40:00.560 --> 40:01.120
I named it.

40:01.120 --> 40:01.600
I'm sorry.

40:01.600 --> 40:04.000
I'm sorry to any of the girls that don't like her name.

40:08.160 --> 40:08.640
Oh, please.

40:13.120 --> 40:14.240
That can give me a few hints.

40:14.880 --> 40:16.000
Oh, I just got wallet.

40:16.000 --> 40:16.800
Sorry.

40:16.800 --> 40:18.160
I really need to heal, I think.

40:18.160 --> 40:20.800
I think next practice is about to smack me.

40:22.080 --> 40:23.360
Wait, he's not even with me?

40:23.360 --> 40:25.680
I've lost my wee dragonfly.

40:27.040 --> 40:27.360
Um...

40:31.200 --> 40:31.680
Oh?

40:32.480 --> 40:33.280
Hi.

40:33.280 --> 40:33.680
Ivory.

40:35.360 --> 40:35.680
Yeah.

40:36.800 --> 40:37.600
I'm the baby.

40:39.760 --> 40:41.200
Oh my god, that's so cute.

40:41.200 --> 40:43.920
A wee puff of smoke when hitting our die.

40:45.760 --> 40:48.320
Then you go back to the start where the rabbits are.

40:49.280 --> 40:51.040
I didn't see any heals.

40:53.920 --> 40:54.720
All right, I don't want...

40:56.240 --> 40:56.880
Oh, I'm scared.

40:56.880 --> 40:58.240
Sorry, I can't see where that guy is.

40:58.800 --> 40:59.440
Behind me.

41:00.960 --> 41:02.240
Is there any dragon that way?

41:03.760 --> 41:04.080
No.

41:05.600 --> 41:07.440
I don't see any bunnies either.

41:13.680 --> 41:15.360
I'll let them think they're going to win, okay?

41:15.360 --> 41:19.360
There's a one behind the castle, though.

41:19.360 --> 41:19.760
Oh, there is.

41:22.160 --> 41:23.600
He hid over that person.

41:24.800 --> 41:26.160
He came up with that as a junior.

41:30.720 --> 41:31.920
I didn't see a bun bun.

41:33.280 --> 41:34.960
There's no sheebie in sight to eat.

41:36.480 --> 41:37.600
I was going to throw that at him.

41:38.960 --> 41:39.440
I...

41:39.440 --> 41:40.240
Can I glide to...

41:40.240 --> 41:41.920
Oh, I definitely can glide to here.

41:41.920 --> 41:42.560
What are you?

41:42.560 --> 41:43.120
Fireworks?

41:45.600 --> 41:47.120
Oh my god, it's the 4th of July.

41:49.440 --> 41:52.160
Again, sorry to everyone that lost a finger on the 4th of July.

41:54.800 --> 41:56.480
We apologize greatly for your...

41:58.720 --> 41:59.280
You lost.

42:03.360 --> 42:04.960
I got yanked out of nowhere.

42:04.960 --> 42:06.000
That was so rude.

42:06.960 --> 42:07.680
So what happens?

42:10.080 --> 42:12.240
Oh, I just respawned the real last left.

42:12.240 --> 42:13.760
Oh, but respawned all the enemies.

42:13.760 --> 42:14.800
They're limited enemies.

42:15.360 --> 42:17.360
Oh, the vulture just not cared about me.

42:18.400 --> 42:19.360
Sorry about that.

42:20.480 --> 42:21.520
Okay, let's try that again.

42:23.120 --> 42:24.400
Looks like I can glide over there.

42:26.320 --> 42:28.240
It was like a souls-like ambush

42:28.240 --> 42:30.960
when Anno literally when the guy's just waiting for you behind the door

42:30.960 --> 42:31.600
and you're like, uh...

42:39.760 --> 42:42.800
Oh, I literally forgot our 4th.

42:43.040 --> 42:44.480
Oh, right.

42:44.480 --> 42:45.600
You stop it.

42:45.600 --> 42:46.560
You're upsetting me.

42:46.560 --> 42:47.280
Give me that heal.

42:48.880 --> 42:49.600
That's this way.

42:55.200 --> 42:56.480
Oh, he doesn't.

42:56.480 --> 42:57.840
I actually seem to kill him.

42:57.840 --> 42:58.400
Oh, well.

43:02.000 --> 43:03.440
Wait, I've already had the dragon here.

43:04.160 --> 43:05.520
I just have to go backwards?

43:09.600 --> 43:11.040
I can hear something all over.

43:13.520 --> 43:15.600
Do not go back to that portal.

43:15.600 --> 43:16.400
They must be...

43:16.400 --> 43:17.440
Oh, there's my dragon here.

43:19.280 --> 43:20.080
Oh, I see.

43:21.280 --> 43:22.080
See him?

43:22.080 --> 43:22.960
How'd I get to you?

43:24.560 --> 43:25.440
Glide over there.

43:25.440 --> 43:26.560
How'd I glide over there?

43:28.720 --> 43:30.240
I'm investigating.

43:30.240 --> 43:31.440
I'm thinking.

43:31.440 --> 43:33.680
I'm using the environmental cues.

43:34.320 --> 43:34.560
Oh.

43:36.160 --> 43:37.280
Oh, bunny's here.

43:38.720 --> 43:40.160
I'm gonna replay the games now.

43:40.160 --> 43:41.600
They're so good.

43:41.600 --> 43:42.320
Oh, god.

43:42.960 --> 43:47.200
I just suck at them so badly.

43:48.240 --> 43:50.800
If you press Y, we'll gain gliding.

43:50.800 --> 43:51.600
You gain height.

43:53.520 --> 43:54.880
That cuts my thing short.

43:57.200 --> 43:58.480
Are you pranking me, Riefling?

43:58.480 --> 43:59.120
Be honest.

44:03.680 --> 44:04.800
Wait, I just hit a circle.

44:04.800 --> 44:05.360
I'm sorry.

44:05.360 --> 44:05.840
I'm sorry.

44:06.640 --> 44:08.880
I'm getting a bit confuzzled in these games, right?

44:08.880 --> 44:11.520
I'm supposed to glade to get to the next wagon.

44:11.600 --> 44:12.880
Which I got 100% to.

44:12.880 --> 44:13.360
Right.

44:13.360 --> 44:14.320
There's water here.

44:16.400 --> 44:17.520
If I jump, jump, jump.

44:18.720 --> 44:20.720
I've already been to the left, right?

44:25.280 --> 44:27.040
I already gladed to there.

44:29.680 --> 44:30.720
That ain't water.

44:30.720 --> 44:31.040
Oil?

44:35.360 --> 44:35.920
Right.

44:35.920 --> 44:36.800
Okay, hold on.

44:37.200 --> 44:40.160
I guess I'll go back and take a right again.

44:40.160 --> 44:41.200
How many am I missing?

44:41.200 --> 44:42.160
Oh, just the one.

44:43.040 --> 44:44.720
Which was like back there.

44:48.320 --> 44:51.440
I'm getting spoiled rotten by the algorithm at the moment.

44:51.440 --> 44:52.160
I'm not even kidding.

44:52.160 --> 44:55.440
And Emmy fantastically got 10,000 subscribers.

44:55.440 --> 44:57.120
I'm so freaking proud of her.

44:57.120 --> 44:58.720
Wait, have I been here before?

45:00.720 --> 45:02.480
I mean, I've been here before.

45:02.480 --> 45:04.000
I mean, I've been here before.

45:04.960 --> 45:07.200
I mean, no, I have been here before.

45:07.200 --> 45:08.240
I just don't remember.

45:09.040 --> 45:10.720
I'll see if there's something over here.

45:14.720 --> 45:16.720
I don't want to get booted off the map

45:17.280 --> 45:18.720
because I'm ramming him,

45:18.720 --> 45:21.120
but he's like so at the edge.

45:22.240 --> 45:22.720
Right.

45:22.720 --> 45:24.000
There was nothing even special here.

45:26.000 --> 45:26.560
I love her.

45:26.560 --> 45:27.360
She says dragon.

45:27.360 --> 45:28.560
She says it like the wagon.

45:28.560 --> 45:29.360
Dragon.

45:30.560 --> 45:32.800
Oh, does it actually sound like I'm saying wagon?

45:32.800 --> 45:41.920
Does it actually sound like I'm saying wagon to you instead of dragon?

45:44.960 --> 45:47.920
If I start streaming, what do you recommend?

45:53.280 --> 45:55.040
I mean, I like YouTube,

45:56.240 --> 45:59.040
but I like YouTube because the rules aren't there.

45:59.680 --> 46:02.960
Well, other than the recent ASMR fiasco,

46:02.960 --> 46:05.200
their rules are normally pretty cut and dry

46:05.200 --> 46:07.280
and it's pretty obvious what you can or can't get rid of.

46:08.720 --> 46:10.000
I don't need jewels.

46:10.000 --> 46:12.160
I need this wagon to the right.

46:15.920 --> 46:16.880
That's over here.

46:18.000 --> 46:19.600
Okay, it must be the Castello,

46:19.600 --> 46:20.560
but how did I get up?

46:25.680 --> 46:27.600
Whoa, I just make it look like this.

46:28.480 --> 46:29.760
It has to be.

46:29.760 --> 46:30.720
I don't see any.

46:35.120 --> 46:35.680
Fuck.

46:35.680 --> 46:36.320
Oh, no.

46:36.960 --> 46:38.640
I have to go all the way around again

46:40.240 --> 46:41.280
to try and make,

46:41.280 --> 46:43.200
to try and be allowed to make that jump.

46:43.920 --> 46:45.200
God, it sucks so bad.

46:46.480 --> 46:47.440
You aren't far behind.

46:47.440 --> 46:48.640
I'm proud of the V-Sucking.

46:49.920 --> 46:51.920
No, I don't want to be first.

46:53.600 --> 46:56.080
Okay, I need to just do a circle around here.

46:56.080 --> 46:56.880
I'm too short.

46:56.880 --> 46:58.400
Don't make fun of me.

46:58.400 --> 47:00.400
No, I want the girls to be ahead of me.

47:01.280 --> 47:03.120
I don't want to be like in the lead,

47:03.120 --> 47:04.720
so I'm glad that Emmy took over.

47:07.040 --> 47:09.120
I really hope Shibi can take over as well.

47:09.120 --> 47:09.920
I think she can.

47:12.240 --> 47:13.360
Hey, right.

47:13.360 --> 47:14.080
What the heck?

47:14.960 --> 47:16.000
Did I just send it?

47:17.520 --> 47:17.920
Oh, shit.

47:18.560 --> 47:20.320
Spyro, can you aim a bit better, please?

47:20.320 --> 47:20.880
Thank you.

47:20.880 --> 47:21.280
Right.

47:21.280 --> 47:21.680
Jump.

47:21.680 --> 47:22.400
Hold.

47:24.160 --> 47:24.480
What?

47:26.880 --> 47:28.080
I'm sure I can do it.

47:28.080 --> 47:29.120
It's like so close.

47:32.160 --> 47:34.320
And the VOD system is a man.

47:34.320 --> 47:36.960
I also find that Twitch is only a good user experience.

47:38.160 --> 47:38.960
Twitch mobile.

47:38.960 --> 47:40.640
Are you squinting me right now?

47:42.160 --> 47:44.720
Have you seen how to train your wagon?

47:44.720 --> 47:47.680
What about the childhood shirt wagon tails?

47:47.680 --> 47:50.560
Sorry, I think the way you say dragon is cute.

47:50.560 --> 47:52.560
I'm saying dragon with an R.

47:52.560 --> 47:53.280
Dragon.

47:53.840 --> 47:54.960
Dragon.

47:54.960 --> 47:56.000
It's not wagon.

47:57.760 --> 47:58.720
Thank you for the five.

48:00.000 --> 48:01.120
Veal or lover.

48:01.120 --> 48:05.440
But oh, oh, for Spyro, buddy.

48:05.440 --> 48:06.160
What was that?

48:07.200 --> 48:09.280
You didn't even try to double jump.

48:09.280 --> 48:10.880
I thought you could like double jump glades.

48:12.160 --> 48:15.760
Ah, we're going to be here for a long time

48:15.760 --> 48:17.200
if I can't even make this damn jump.

48:18.400 --> 48:19.840
Then you aren't focusing.

48:19.840 --> 48:21.120
You see the wagon.

48:21.120 --> 48:21.920
Dragon.

48:22.720 --> 48:25.360
Dragon.

48:27.440 --> 48:30.160
My nuts on your face.

48:32.160 --> 48:32.880
Double jump.

48:32.880 --> 48:34.000
I'm trying.

48:37.440 --> 48:39.680
I'm freaking missing it by a bore here.

48:41.600 --> 48:44.480
Lord of Storms, thank you for the five gifted memberships.

48:44.480 --> 48:46.480
Congrats to those who caught it with their face.

48:49.440 --> 48:52.640
I think you do have to enable it if you're just bing chining.

48:53.200 --> 48:57.200
If you're a lurker, I think the chat prompts you to enable it.

48:57.200 --> 48:59.040
I'm so sorry this is taken.

48:59.040 --> 49:01.040
I'm sure this is like a super easy jump

49:01.040 --> 49:03.600
and it's just hard for me because I'm really low IQ.

49:04.880 --> 49:05.680
All right, hold on.

49:08.240 --> 49:10.160
Please, Spyro, please.

49:10.160 --> 49:12.080
Does he actually get a boost if I press Y?

49:12.080 --> 49:12.800
Because I will do it.

49:15.200 --> 49:15.840
I will do it.

49:15.840 --> 49:19.120
I need something to glide off to practice this Y boost.

49:19.280 --> 49:23.920
Just learning curves exist for a reason.

49:23.920 --> 49:27.360
What do you mean I can't be MLG pro in a child's game in two seconds flat?

49:27.360 --> 49:30.320
Right, if I do, and then Y.

49:30.320 --> 49:32.720
No, Y doesn't give me a freaking sec.

49:36.720 --> 49:37.520
Path for the Storm.

49:37.520 --> 49:38.400
I'm just trying to sleep.

49:38.400 --> 49:41.040
There's no, don't contain the Scottish rage.

49:41.040 --> 49:44.960
Honestly, I'm like, bro, I mean, we can always quit and go to the next mission.

49:45.520 --> 49:47.280
All right, I'll give it one more shot.

49:47.360 --> 49:49.440
This rest on my entire.

49:51.200 --> 49:51.520
Okay.

49:54.240 --> 49:55.600
And then right on the edge.

49:56.400 --> 49:57.200
Come on.

49:59.200 --> 50:02.000
I'm not going crazy or is that really hard for no reason?

50:03.760 --> 50:04.960
All right, give me one more chance.

50:04.960 --> 50:05.600
One more chance.

50:05.600 --> 50:06.160
One more chance.

50:08.560 --> 50:11.360
Just give me one more chance.

50:12.080 --> 50:18.960
Oh, maybe you just can't do it that way.

50:18.960 --> 50:22.560
Someone said just you're not supposed to jump from there.

50:25.920 --> 50:27.040
There's nowhere else to be.

50:30.320 --> 50:32.480
I can't get up on these wee things here.

50:33.760 --> 50:35.440
Turn around and fly in whole.

50:36.320 --> 50:40.880
Fly in whole.

50:45.040 --> 50:46.000
That wooden door.

50:51.920 --> 50:54.560
It's really hard, but you have to keep trying on the edge.

50:55.600 --> 50:59.280
Stop at the stairs, turn around, then fly into a hole.

51:00.240 --> 51:04.400
But hole.

51:08.880 --> 51:10.400
But you're supposed to be the smart one.

51:11.200 --> 51:14.480
I only have three brain cells and they're fighting for fourth place.

51:16.480 --> 51:17.280
Try finger.

51:19.520 --> 51:23.120
I do remember never beating this game because I was too frustrated and I did beat two and three.

51:23.920 --> 51:25.760
Stone stairs of it back.

51:25.760 --> 51:26.080
Okay.

51:27.600 --> 51:28.880
Oh, you fucking twat.

51:28.880 --> 51:31.920
Right, stone stairs and then fly into butthole.

51:33.120 --> 51:36.240
Stone stairs and fly into butthole.

51:43.120 --> 51:45.360
Is it from that ledge I'm supposed to do it?

51:53.600 --> 51:54.320
Is it that?

51:54.320 --> 51:55.840
Is it honestly that one?

51:59.440 --> 52:07.200
Oh, I'm not losing it.

52:07.200 --> 52:09.760
I'm actually losing it and I fucking get skin corn.

52:12.640 --> 52:14.960
Oh my god, that's so evil from the dead team.

52:14.960 --> 52:15.360
So is.

52:19.200 --> 52:19.840
Oh, right.

52:19.840 --> 52:20.160
Okay.

52:20.160 --> 52:20.480
Okay.

52:21.120 --> 52:23.360
And then I just take a really short left.

52:24.560 --> 52:25.680
Oh, for goodness sake.

52:27.520 --> 52:27.920
Offer.

52:29.360 --> 52:32.080
Bro, why did you guys let me do that for so long?

52:33.440 --> 52:34.880
I'm embarrassing myself here.

52:36.240 --> 52:37.840
That literally took a millisecond.

52:44.880 --> 52:46.400
You let me struggle for how long?

52:47.520 --> 52:48.000
Pass it.

52:48.000 --> 52:48.560
Bend over.

52:48.560 --> 52:49.600
You're all getting spanked.

52:49.600 --> 52:51.520
You let me struggle for who?

52:54.160 --> 52:56.080
We'll grab the key but we aren't really gonna.

52:59.040 --> 53:00.160
Golf clap.

53:00.160 --> 53:00.800
Good job.

53:00.800 --> 53:02.080
Right, we got four dragons.

53:03.280 --> 53:06.160
I don't know that was the solution but at your third try,

53:06.160 --> 53:09.520
the lesson is that maybe that's not a solution yet.

53:09.520 --> 53:10.960
I think I'll go with that as well.

53:10.960 --> 53:12.800
But it looked like I was so close.

53:12.800 --> 53:15.040
I mean, they probably did that for a reason.

53:18.080 --> 53:18.720
Uh, right.

53:19.520 --> 53:21.040
We're just looking for a portal.

53:22.080 --> 53:23.280
Oh, they're scared of me.

53:23.280 --> 53:24.560
Yeah, you should be actually.

53:24.560 --> 53:25.600
Right, that's where I came in.

53:26.320 --> 53:27.600
Oh, I never even unlocked you.

53:27.600 --> 53:28.000
Sorry.

53:29.280 --> 53:30.160
Hi, Magnus.

53:36.720 --> 53:39.120
Yeah, please burn the tents.

53:39.120 --> 53:40.880
Oh, we're pillaging now?

53:40.880 --> 53:41.440
Oh dear.

53:42.560 --> 53:45.040
Thanks again, Lord of Storms for the gifted memberships.

53:45.040 --> 53:46.160
I appreciate it.

53:46.160 --> 53:47.440
And then I get to see my moats.

53:48.000 --> 53:52.880
I'm waiting for the next moat update as I just coughed there.

53:53.840 --> 53:55.840
I should be coming in soon.

53:55.840 --> 53:58.160
I think up next is Mercy the Moats.

53:59.760 --> 54:00.560
Or is it Sheebie?

54:01.440 --> 54:06.560
It's either Sheebie, Mercy, Azura, or Mercy, Sheebie, Azura, and then me last.

54:07.200 --> 54:09.840
But that's because we can be patient for a moat.

54:09.840 --> 54:11.440
I want the girls to have theirs first.

54:12.400 --> 54:13.680
This isn't Elden Ring.

54:13.680 --> 54:17.760
You probably can't just bash your head into a wall over and get into a works.

54:17.760 --> 54:20.160
Well, that's why I normally spawn you guys in at that point.

54:21.360 --> 54:23.040
Although I've been cheating from the start.

54:23.040 --> 54:27.280
Like, I know I was supposed to use a, like, explore the DLC on my own,

54:27.280 --> 54:29.760
but I just like playing games with you.

54:29.760 --> 54:31.600
Like, I like when you hold my hand through stuff.

54:31.600 --> 54:34.080
Like, I had so much fun playing the Jellybean game.

54:34.080 --> 54:34.960
I was so excited.

54:34.960 --> 54:35.760
I was like, listen...

54:35.760 --> 54:36.560
Oh, sorry.

54:38.400 --> 54:42.720
I like listen to some of the thing and you can hear the excitement in my voice

54:42.720 --> 54:45.760
because my voice was, like, so light-pitched the entire stream

54:45.760 --> 54:47.280
because I was just so happy playing.

54:47.840 --> 54:49.840
So with you, I was like, oh, I don't really...

54:49.840 --> 54:52.080
I was, like, up here, like, oh, no, no, no, no, no.

54:52.080 --> 54:53.200
Instead of, like, my...

54:53.200 --> 54:55.520
Usually, like, down here, generic talking.

54:56.240 --> 54:56.720
Um...

54:58.640 --> 55:00.240
Oh, I got snowball fight going on.

55:02.240 --> 55:03.200
Okay, first dragon.

55:03.200 --> 55:03.840
Oh!

55:03.840 --> 55:05.120
There is a bat.

55:05.120 --> 55:06.560
I think it just took my health.

55:10.880 --> 55:14.080
I like how Micev indulges thanks to the same creatives

55:14.080 --> 55:15.200
being commissioned first.

55:15.200 --> 55:16.080
Mmm.

55:16.080 --> 55:18.560
Well, the ACs are most actually a little bit different

55:18.560 --> 55:20.240
than what we commissioned the first time.

55:20.240 --> 55:21.920
But she was just super happy to get them.

55:21.920 --> 55:23.360
And I was like, well, she's not complaining.

55:23.360 --> 55:24.480
It means less work for me.

55:24.720 --> 55:27.600
So I'll just accept them, which is terrible,

55:27.600 --> 55:30.080
but, oh, I have to admit, I'm a bit tired

55:30.880 --> 55:35.200
of doing, like, in the background work.

55:35.920 --> 55:36.880
I think it's terrible.

55:36.880 --> 55:39.440
Like, I love what I do, and I'm so lucky that I get to do it.

55:39.440 --> 55:44.000
But, oh, I can't wait for, like, all the most order type things.

55:44.000 --> 55:48.000
Thank you, CRC Error, for the membership.

55:48.640 --> 55:53.120
It's really cute.

55:53.120 --> 55:54.000
And...

55:56.400 --> 55:57.360
Kendra?

55:57.360 --> 55:58.480
The very VTuber?

56:00.000 --> 56:00.560
Hello!

56:00.560 --> 56:02.320
Thank you for redirecting into me.

56:03.200 --> 56:04.320
We're just playing Spyro,

56:04.320 --> 56:06.560
which is a childhood game of everyone,

56:06.560 --> 56:08.240
but me, I've never played it before.

56:08.800 --> 56:10.080
And I'm struggling a little bit,

56:10.080 --> 56:11.280
and it's a bit cringe,

56:11.280 --> 56:13.200
but it's still a kid's game,

56:13.200 --> 56:14.960
so there's hope that I can complete it.

56:15.680 --> 56:16.960
Um, hello!

56:19.120 --> 56:20.800
I am Strony Culls from

56:22.320 --> 56:24.480
Availers, Gen 1, and Dolls.

56:26.960 --> 56:30.480
And that's pretty much it.

56:30.480 --> 56:31.760
I'm wildly inappropriate,

56:31.760 --> 56:33.040
so if you don't like that, please,

56:33.040 --> 56:34.640
do not ever feel forced to watch me.

56:37.360 --> 56:39.600
We're just playing Spy...

56:39.600 --> 56:40.720
This is a dead end?

56:40.720 --> 56:41.280
Oh, no.

56:42.160 --> 56:44.560
Um, we're just collecting all the dragons.

56:44.560 --> 56:45.840
We're not doing all the gems,

56:45.840 --> 56:47.760
but this is Spyro 1 Remake.

56:48.480 --> 56:48.800
Um...

56:50.320 --> 56:52.320
We're just getting all our new dragons

56:52.320 --> 56:53.280
and doing it right now.

56:54.880 --> 56:55.200
What?

56:56.720 --> 56:58.160
Thank you for releasing me!

56:58.720 --> 56:59.120
Hello!

57:00.240 --> 57:02.080
Okay, no more tutorial information.

57:02.080 --> 57:03.280
That's interesting.

57:07.760 --> 57:09.440
But yeah, we unlocked the little dragons

57:09.440 --> 57:11.280
by touching the green statue.

57:11.280 --> 57:12.000
Huge.

57:12.720 --> 57:15.280
You've got the camera angle on that.

57:15.280 --> 57:16.640
I'm struggling a wee bit,

57:16.640 --> 57:17.680
but that angle stopped me.

57:23.840 --> 57:24.720
No, it didn't.

57:35.040 --> 57:36.400
Am I doing it justice?

57:36.400 --> 57:36.960
I'm glad.

57:36.960 --> 57:38.720
I feel like I'm so low energy today,

57:38.720 --> 57:40.880
but I was very ill yesterday.

57:40.880 --> 57:41.600
Oh my god.

57:42.960 --> 57:45.920
That taxi driver was trying to take me out.

57:45.920 --> 57:46.880
I swear he's like,

57:46.880 --> 57:48.320
now I'm gonna fuck you up.

57:48.320 --> 57:50.080
Thank you so much for the tip, Anonymous.

57:50.080 --> 57:51.360
I'm glad you're enjoying it.

57:51.360 --> 57:53.040
I feel a bit, um...

57:55.040 --> 57:57.040
Insecure's a bit of a dramatic word,

57:57.040 --> 57:58.320
like fucking relax.

57:58.320 --> 57:59.600
But like, I feel a bit like,

57:59.600 --> 58:01.440
oh no, I'm not really doing that well.

58:02.320 --> 58:02.640
Um...

58:05.760 --> 58:07.280
This game is perfect for a chill stream.

58:07.280 --> 58:07.840
You're doing great.

58:07.840 --> 58:08.800
I'm loving the dance.

58:08.800 --> 58:09.760
Oh, thank you.

58:10.720 --> 58:12.320
You're in a little ego boost, right?

58:12.320 --> 58:13.360
I don't know where they're at.

58:13.360 --> 58:13.840
Thank you.

58:15.840 --> 58:18.320
Oh, how much they went right past the...

58:18.320 --> 58:18.880
Is it there?

58:19.680 --> 58:21.920
Or is it just saying that there's a shining gem there?

58:23.440 --> 58:25.040
Okay, I think we're gonna have to backtrack

58:25.040 --> 58:26.960
to try and find this other dragon.

58:28.720 --> 58:31.520
And yes, I'm seeing dragon on purpose like that now,

58:31.520 --> 58:32.800
because you guys are a billion, though.

58:34.480 --> 58:35.120
Oh, it's okay.

58:35.120 --> 58:36.320
You're probably doing better than me.

58:36.640 --> 58:40.640
Uh...

58:44.000 --> 58:45.280
The music's cute,

58:46.720 --> 58:50.640
but not cute enough for Gen 2's background music

58:50.640 --> 58:52.240
to be themed off of all.

58:52.240 --> 58:54.800
I'm gonna see if I can be cheeky and get,

58:56.480 --> 58:56.800
maybe,

58:58.480 --> 58:59.280
Minish Cap.

59:00.320 --> 59:01.600
I do like Minish Cap.

59:01.600 --> 59:02.480
I really do.

59:02.480 --> 59:04.080
Right, that's a ledge to jump over

59:04.080 --> 59:05.120
if I've ever seen one.

59:05.120 --> 59:06.240
Can I climb up somewhere?

59:07.840 --> 59:08.560
I can.

59:08.560 --> 59:11.200
Okay, I think it must be this ledge then.

59:15.600 --> 59:16.720
Yeah, come on.

59:17.840 --> 59:18.880
Nope, it's not.

59:18.880 --> 59:20.080
All right, we're downflyed too.

59:20.080 --> 59:21.760
Come on, give it to me straight.

59:25.280 --> 59:26.960
Ah, I don't have the key for that.

59:28.160 --> 59:31.840
Crash Bandicoot, twin sanity background music.

59:32.480 --> 59:36.720
Yeah, I remember you beating the final boss like a real pro.

59:39.040 --> 59:39.360
What?

59:42.560 --> 59:43.360
Conk, conk, conk.

59:47.120 --> 59:49.200
I'm searching, I'm looking.

59:52.240 --> 59:52.560
What?

59:54.800 --> 59:55.280
I don't...

59:56.640 --> 59:57.360
Go away, please.

59:57.360 --> 01:00:02.000
Is he gonna get me?

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:02.240
No.

01:00:03.520 --> 01:00:04.000
I was like,

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:06.480
is the height difference about to enroll me?

01:00:06.480 --> 01:00:08.160
Wait, I'm all the way back at the start.

01:00:09.680 --> 01:00:10.000
Huh?

01:00:13.520 --> 01:00:14.800
Where's this flipping dragon?

01:00:14.800 --> 01:00:15.840
I never noticed that.

01:00:15.840 --> 01:00:16.640
Is it like hiding?

01:00:18.960 --> 01:00:20.960
Last dragon is hella hard to find.

01:00:24.560 --> 01:00:27.040
Clearly, I've freaking gone past the dum-dum.

01:00:27.120 --> 01:00:28.800
Is he like under a hidden thing?

01:00:28.800 --> 01:00:31.280
Like, you gotta do a U-turn to get to it and fly down.

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:33.040
Mr. Bat, please.

01:00:34.160 --> 01:00:36.000
Okay, he's gonna heal up Spark.

01:00:36.960 --> 01:00:37.760
Is he here?

01:00:39.280 --> 01:00:40.400
Oh, this is a bedding.

01:00:41.520 --> 01:00:43.600
You have a mini map on the lower left screen.

01:00:46.880 --> 01:00:50.160
Oh, I forgot about that.

01:00:51.200 --> 01:00:53.280
Oh, you mean that big thing that really helps out

01:00:53.280 --> 01:00:55.520
to tell you where like hidden locations and stuff is?

01:00:56.480 --> 01:00:58.080
Okay, it looks like...

01:00:58.080 --> 01:00:58.560
I...

01:00:58.560 --> 01:00:59.760
Whoa, don't do that.

01:00:59.760 --> 01:01:00.560
That was a very nice...

01:01:02.400 --> 01:01:03.600
Okay, it looks...

01:01:03.600 --> 01:01:07.200
This is just a platform for the sake of being a platform.

01:01:09.680 --> 01:01:11.920
Oh, my sister go down there to get the denki.

01:01:18.160 --> 01:01:19.600
So then what was the bed on that?

01:01:22.800 --> 01:01:23.600
Something over here?

01:01:26.160 --> 01:01:27.760
Wait, where did we dot something on?

01:01:29.760 --> 01:01:30.800
Hmm, okay.

01:01:33.760 --> 01:01:35.440
So there's like a weird U-turn in here?

01:01:36.400 --> 01:01:37.760
Wow, that's so tall.

01:01:38.960 --> 01:01:40.240
And I'm so tiny.

01:01:43.840 --> 01:01:45.760
What's the lives up there as well?

01:01:46.960 --> 01:01:48.960
Hold on, right, must be something back here.

01:01:51.040 --> 01:01:52.720
Yeah, but qua, you're welcome.

01:01:53.520 --> 01:01:56.080
To say you are welcome in French, you say?

01:01:57.360 --> 01:02:00.080
Oh, this one's lured and the other one's.

01:02:02.880 --> 01:02:04.080
Oh, my God, I'm so smart.

01:02:04.080 --> 01:02:04.880
Are you squinting?

01:02:04.880 --> 01:02:05.520
I'm so smart.

01:02:23.600 --> 01:02:24.560
E-e-e-e-ego.

01:02:24.560 --> 01:02:25.520
I just hear...

01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:32.560
Do you want me to say it with a harsh Scottish accent then?

01:02:32.560 --> 01:02:37.120
Dragon, is that what you want me to refer to all of them as dragon?

01:02:37.120 --> 01:02:40.240
Oh look at my dragonfly of a health bar.

01:02:40.240 --> 01:02:42.960

01:05:13.680 --> 01:05:15.680
Oh

01:05:20.400 --> 01:05:22.400

So they just perish themselves, I mean, I'll take it I'm not gonna complain about it. I was oh

01:05:58.560 --> 01:06:00.560

Dr. Shemp thinks he's so cool. You don't know what it's been like listening to him over and over

01:06:44.320 --> 01:06:47.880
But I tell you one thing you should watch his back

01:06:48.360 --> 01:06:53.360
Every single interest in everyone thought Amy was a visual. I mean she can I believe that

01:06:55.440 --> 01:06:57.440
This is a boss fight

01:07:08.840 --> 01:07:16.280
Is that a boss mate? Oh, no, it keeps going. Okay. Okay. How many dragons are there? Oh, I've already done it

Okay, okay, I got it. I got it. It was time and it was just time and I can just spam it down

I didn't have to think of anything. Sorry

01:08:03.160 --> 01:08:05.160
Okay, one more

01:08:05.200 --> 01:08:07.200

01:08:08.120 --> 01:08:10.120
Whoa

01:08:17.160 --> 01:08:20.240
Are you just get Jules for the enemy side? Okay, okay, that makes sense

01:08:25.120 --> 01:08:28.120
Bunk bunk bunk up first that's why I'm returning home

Stony that booty rivals your own gal only one of us can have the superior be in this house

01:08:35.160 --> 01:08:37.160
That's what he gets for kidnapping acu-acu

01:08:45.600 --> 01:08:47.600
This is a dead end

01:08:48.080 --> 01:08:52.400
Do not touch whatever the purple stuff is. I don't know what it is. I don't want to know

01:08:53.240 --> 01:08:56.680
Ah, okay cliff time we did

Got the cameras a bit unfree. That's where I got him. I get motion sick playing this game

01:09:13.240 --> 01:09:17.800
I did not get motion sick playing games, but that's where I came from

01:09:23.280 --> 01:09:25.280
Oh, it's a life. Just beat you

01:09:25.760 --> 01:09:31.280

Don't the balloon guy here, and he was gonna take me away

Hmm what a weird stone it has a target right on there and there's a cannon nearby

01:10:35.600 --> 01:10:37.600
I

01:10:46.880 --> 01:10:48.920
Can in your bag stall

I can't I'm just gonna burn all the cannons

01:11:02.200 --> 01:11:09.520
Hold on cannon cannon cannon. How are you supposed to figure any of this out?

01:11:13.160 --> 01:11:16.200
Target I see the target I push it over

01:11:18.760 --> 01:11:22.240
No, I can't offer goodness sake

01:11:29.200 --> 01:11:31.200
Okay

01:11:32.440 --> 01:11:37.320
Okay, okay, okay, not bad. Thank you for the hand. We got there in the end

01:11:42.200 --> 01:11:44.520
It really gave me time to react to that

01:11:45.800 --> 01:11:50.840
Good job job story is so clever. Yeah thought about all myself. Thank you

01:11:51.720 --> 01:11:54.720
Keep up the good work, and I know you'll fulfill your oh

01:12:02.280 --> 01:12:06.000
Hey strongy think you could teach us some Scottish Gaelic

01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:08.680
I have a goal of learning new languages

01:12:08.680 --> 01:12:16.400
I am so sorry, but I come from the mainland of Scotland, and I was not taught gaelic at all

01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:18.640
aim

01:12:18.640 --> 01:12:24.480
So I'm sorry to disappoint gaelic lover, but actually I can't teach it because I was never taught it myself

01:12:24.880 --> 01:12:27.640
The only words I know are polis

01:12:28.480 --> 01:12:30.480
aim

01:12:32.600 --> 01:12:34.600
Oh

01:12:34.960 --> 01:12:40.720
Police is polis and Scotland is Alba. Those are the only words. I know okay. How'd I get over here?

01:12:40.720 --> 01:12:44.400
I still keep the dragon, right? Okay, if I keep the dragon. Oh, no, don't

01:12:46.920 --> 01:12:48.920
What I need the balloon I

01:12:51.800 --> 01:12:53.800
Can't believe I did that honestly

01:12:54.360 --> 01:12:59.640
Only I would manage that. Okay, we're doing it. No, we're not we're not doing the night flight. We ain't doing any flights

01:12:59.640 --> 01:13:01.240
Oh, sorry

01:13:01.360 --> 01:13:03.960
That's where the whole other is the hot air balloon guy

01:13:06.680 --> 01:13:11.280
Okay, take this I can't believe how fast you found so much stolen

01:13:13.280 --> 01:13:18.960
Yeah, magic crafters I'm surprised you don't know any ranchy words in

01:13:20.760 --> 01:13:23.160
Gaelic or Gaelic lover and

01:13:24.320 --> 01:13:29.960
No one spoke it I come from the mainland of Scotland and now if you come from the islands up north or way up north

01:13:29.960 --> 01:13:34.480
You're most likely to be taught it. So you're just talking an accent

01:13:36.440 --> 01:13:38.680
Like a regional accent I and

01:13:39.600 --> 01:13:46.800
Slang but like Scott slang but not Gaelic not Scott's Gaelic and I was never taught that they

01:13:47.400 --> 01:13:50.480
So folk are actually wanting to be taught it so it doesn't

01:13:53.800 --> 01:13:58.280
Juice I can't even see I'm around these damn corners. Oh, I can't jump

01:14:00.800 --> 01:14:02.800
I'll

01:14:04.480 --> 01:14:06.480
You

01:14:07.160 --> 01:14:12.200
It's pronounced Alba and Gaelic Alba spell ELB

01:14:13.040 --> 01:14:15.040
Oh, I love us. I

01:14:15.920 --> 01:14:20.800
Love oh my god. No shit. There's that's one stop. Is it bad here?

01:14:23.440 --> 01:14:25.440
Rescue the egg

01:14:25.440 --> 01:14:27.440
I

01:14:29.400 --> 01:14:31.400
Got walled

01:14:34.880 --> 01:14:36.880
Wow, wow, wow, wow

01:14:39.400 --> 01:14:45.320
Oh, it's with Shadow Wizard money games we love casting spells at the Alpine Ridge

01:14:46.720 --> 01:14:48.720
You need to chase him in the other direction

01:14:56.240 --> 01:15:02.040
And you teach Sunday in Scots so that we can flirt with the nice lassie on vacation

01:15:03.240 --> 01:15:07.080
There's really not any nice Scottish slang that I can think of

01:15:07.880 --> 01:15:08.880
and

01:15:08.880 --> 01:15:14.000
If she's pregnant you see oh, she's up the Duff which is just

01:15:15.200 --> 01:15:17.760
It's not that pleasant of a terminology

01:15:17.760 --> 01:15:22.840
I guess technically if you want to ask a Scottish chick, do you want to be pregnant by me?

01:15:22.840 --> 01:15:24.840
You'd be like odd you want to be up the Duff?

01:15:25.440 --> 01:15:29.960
Or like I'll get you up the Duff. Oh, yeah up the Duff. I'm not even kidding

01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:36.000
The fire back

01:15:39.440 --> 01:15:43.480
Sorry, hold on. Okay. Well, if he's not gonna get me then he's not gonna get me

01:15:47.840 --> 01:15:49.840
He can raid him

01:15:50.280 --> 01:15:59.720
Isn't the Duff also fine for the but and Scots it just means pregnant like oh, she's up the Duff

01:16:00.160 --> 01:16:02.160
But normally it's like a disapproving

01:16:03.120 --> 01:16:05.120
taper

01:16:08.360 --> 01:16:10.360
Is that them going out?

01:16:11.600 --> 01:16:15.240
Plop plop plop get up the Duff basically if I did like a Scottish

01:16:15.560 --> 01:16:18.040
Or do I'd be like get me up the Duff get me up the Duff

01:16:18.040 --> 01:16:21.000
It just doesn't say it's not very pleasant terminology though

01:16:21.920 --> 01:16:23.760
No

01:16:23.760 --> 01:16:27.880
Get off the Duff get off the Duff get off the Duff get off the Duff

01:16:30.120 --> 01:16:32.120
Thank you Raven

01:16:32.840 --> 01:16:38.160
It's get up up up up to get off the Duff isn't a thing has to be up

01:16:45.240 --> 01:16:47.240
Oh

01:16:48.400 --> 01:16:50.400
Get it in the river

01:16:51.360 --> 01:16:53.360
Mustn't be

01:16:54.040 --> 01:16:56.320
Mustn't be a dead-on kind of you

01:16:58.320 --> 01:17:00.320
You still make dragonfly

01:17:05.720 --> 01:17:07.720
Huh

01:17:08.600 --> 01:17:10.600
I

01:17:13.520 --> 01:17:15.520
Like I said, huh?

01:17:19.720 --> 01:17:21.720
Dragon crazy

01:17:25.920 --> 01:17:30.520
Yeah, I didn't know what the game wanted me for there

01:17:32.520 --> 01:17:37.440
Maybe someone doesn't want to get go. Oh my bad. I was thinking about the Chuff not Duff

01:17:38.720 --> 01:17:40.720
Huh

01:17:42.680 --> 01:17:44.680
Come on

01:17:47.760 --> 01:17:50.400
That's such a distance though

01:17:54.560 --> 01:17:56.560
No buzz

01:17:56.560 --> 01:17:58.560
Oh

01:18:03.160 --> 01:18:05.160
Can't yell

01:18:05.840 --> 01:18:11.920
No, it doesn't need to give me more money as I was saying plop plop plop plop

01:18:12.200 --> 01:18:15.960
Get up the Duff get up the Duff this get up the Duff

01:18:18.080 --> 01:18:22.360
Thank you again Raven and it's it and ask me to get out the

01:18:23.360 --> 01:18:29.720
There will be no birthing of the lot the only thing on birth in his gen 2 maybe gen 3

01:18:31.080 --> 01:18:35.520
And then that's that's all the birthing. Oh, this is any more. I'm supposed to go

01:18:36.480 --> 01:18:42.160
I'm not supposed to over there. I'm stuck over here now. Can he be?

01:18:47.480 --> 01:18:51.000
A Spyro up the Duff. Spyro is not pregnant. He just has a little belly

01:18:52.880 --> 01:18:54.880
Oh

01:18:56.480 --> 01:19:01.520
This Leo is really confusing me. I'm confuzzled

01:19:04.760 --> 01:19:11.840
Looks like I'm supposed to do something to open that platform type thing, but I've not done it so I keep perishing

01:19:17.560 --> 01:19:19.560
I'm like on my own over here

01:19:20.440 --> 01:19:25.120
Is there like a secret? Does this game have secret walls?

01:19:29.800 --> 01:19:31.800
You should pass the lead

01:19:34.800 --> 01:19:40.440
There also may be a way to catch the egg guy that escaped earlier as a person that has 100% at this game

01:19:40.440 --> 01:19:44.720
multiple times both in childhood and after the remake watching this has given me a small panic attack

01:19:44.720 --> 01:19:46.720
Why am I doing everything the wrong way?

01:19:47.640 --> 01:19:51.800
The Geomancers are supposed to open it, but I don't recall where he is

01:19:52.520 --> 01:19:55.920
So I've basically progressed on the side of the map. I'm not supposed to I

01:19:59.000 --> 01:20:04.320
Like when Scots type funny and complain about things on to our baby coughing on our bus right as I needed to

01:20:04.680 --> 01:20:09.360
Cough so I nearly exploded hold on in because I didn't want to look like someone who copies babies

01:20:09.360 --> 01:20:14.840
Oh my god, my favorite one is I want to wrap myself up in tin foil and blow myself up to fuck

01:20:17.640 --> 01:20:21.240
Okay, yeah, something's supposed to open this

01:20:22.320 --> 01:20:27.960
Is it that twat back there? There might be hold on let me perish need reset

01:20:29.640 --> 01:20:34.920
Honestly, if you type it in it's like want to wrap myself up in tin foil and blow myself up to fucking the microwave

01:20:34.920 --> 01:20:37.360
It's the funniest thing. I'm fucking red. I love it so much

01:20:37.800 --> 01:20:42.720
That's why I sometimes go like, oh, I want to blow myself up, but it's because of that tin foil tweet

01:20:42.720 --> 01:20:49.720
Is it that? Is that why that ledge didn't open?

01:20:55.200 --> 01:20:59.040
How confusing I might have to do a different mission

01:21:00.280 --> 01:21:04.840
I'm not sure what the game wants of me. Yeah, all those guys have just spawned back in as well

01:21:06.040 --> 01:21:10.960
I'm not supposed to get every single one and that's the the deal

01:21:13.080 --> 01:21:21.920
So what I take a left destroy them all left side, and then it should open up wherever I'm missing

01:21:26.880 --> 01:21:30.160
Get one oh he's too big

01:21:35.840 --> 01:21:37.840
That was a bit cheap

01:21:38.480 --> 01:21:43.120
Okay, no

01:21:45.920 --> 01:21:50.440
And then what defeat this guy that's everything in the area defeated

01:21:51.880 --> 01:21:55.680
I'm being trolled of this platform doesn't come down right I'm being trolled

01:21:55.680 --> 01:21:57.760
I may have to quit this one. I don't know what I'm supposed to do

01:21:58.760 --> 01:22:01.040
The game is tied to frames per second

01:22:08.840 --> 01:22:14.480
I always interest and see how others play this game. You need to collect all the wee orbs

01:22:19.200 --> 01:22:22.200
I need to be 30 frames per second

01:22:24.760 --> 01:22:26.760
Is that real

01:22:29.520 --> 01:22:35.360
Oh my god, it's so bitty. What oh my god, it's so bitty though

01:22:37.840 --> 01:22:39.840
Oh

01:22:41.320 --> 01:22:43.320
My god, oh

01:22:45.680 --> 01:22:47.680
This looks awful though

01:22:49.920 --> 01:22:51.920
And I put it back on

01:22:54.000 --> 01:22:57.640
My ring cloud, thank you for the redirect

01:22:58.920 --> 01:23:00.920
We're currently

01:23:01.120 --> 01:23:02.520
playing

01:23:02.520 --> 01:23:06.240
Spiral which is a childhood game of not me, but of you guys

01:23:07.040 --> 01:23:08.480
and

01:23:08.480 --> 01:23:12.360
I'm currently getting wrecked by Framerate. Oh, I can't a

01:23:14.200 --> 01:23:18.200
For goodness sake. No, don't look close your eyes. Don't look at this embarrassment

01:23:19.000 --> 01:23:21.000
site

01:23:21.480 --> 01:23:26.480
Side chick kisses for you. I'm strongy calls from be a lure

01:23:26.480 --> 01:23:30.680
I actually had the opportunity to play with rain cloud on and a moongers club

01:23:31.640 --> 01:23:33.320
And

01:23:33.320 --> 01:23:39.520
Might recognize the Scottish voice if not, it's perfect to find I'm strongy calls from be a lures gen one

01:23:40.640 --> 01:23:45.400
And today indulges in journey. I'm so rubbish at this stuff

01:23:46.080 --> 01:23:49.240
and and and and and and and then

01:23:51.880 --> 01:23:57.240
And being close awesome, thank you. I thought you were Mexican motherfucker

01:23:57.240 --> 01:23:59.240

Oh, it's me. Oh, where is the loo the wagons?

01:24:05.920 --> 01:24:07.920

Hope stream is fine. Yes. Hope you had a fun stream too

01:24:16.960 --> 01:24:21.440
Okay, I'm a health out. Oh, I'm in trouble. I don't know where the other guy is but

01:24:22.280 --> 01:24:26.200
Can you eat the butterfly that came from that sheet or did there no have bar?

01:24:26.200 --> 01:24:30.320
Oh, there's a butterfly. Go eat it. Look. I see it. It's like jumping up and down. It's fluttering get it

01:24:30.760 --> 01:24:35.160
Fuck it up. Fuck it up. Tear it up. Oh, no, you're fine. You're so dramatic

01:24:39.280 --> 01:24:42.800
Ugui is a turtle no dragon. Go on the S. The Lou dragon

01:24:48.200 --> 01:24:55.160
This just for gems down here like it makes the Constraini stream

01:24:56.200 --> 01:25:00.800
I don't speak any of the lingo though. I'd be doing a prey

01:25:03.600 --> 01:25:09.000
You got absolutely wrecked. I mean, yeah, you just ever take that. Oh speaking of being right

01:25:13.960 --> 01:25:15.960
Boy Strony

01:25:16.840 --> 01:25:18.960
Sure, show the Oxford to the new

01:25:19.640 --> 01:25:22.920
What are you even saying? We didn't see a moment

01:25:23.440 --> 01:25:26.640
Thank you. Thank you, do you fling you understand?

01:25:28.880 --> 01:25:33.480
Latina for Gentoo. I'm very curious to see how

01:25:35.000 --> 01:25:37.680
Wait, is that all the dragons? No, I've missed one dress

01:25:39.960 --> 01:25:41.960
Don't put me back out there

01:25:43.640 --> 01:25:45.760
Where it must be on this side

01:25:52.920 --> 01:25:54.920
Oh

01:25:54.960 --> 01:25:57.800
See something. Oh, wait. No, I came from there

01:26:01.320 --> 01:26:08.060
Fear the chancla should I get well get a milflatina and her gimmick is she can throw a chancla that would be our custom toggle

01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:15.200
Right, there's definitely something over here. Oh shit. Was that supposed to do what I think I was supposed to do and

01:26:16.240 --> 01:26:20.840
Fly from all the way up there over there. I think so. Oh, there's a ledge

01:26:20.840 --> 01:26:25.840
It's a ledge now. Don't be fooled by the layout of this game. There's a lot of ledges

01:26:27.760 --> 01:26:31.800
That kind of just pop it nowhere. Okay, let's try that again

01:26:33.280 --> 01:26:38.200
Okay, easy peasy. Let me squeeze it. That was exactly what I was supposed to do. I was like a guy

01:26:40.240 --> 01:26:42.240
Chancles are heat seeking

01:26:51.080 --> 01:26:56.040
Oh my god, it's fire. You're actually so brave. I'm not wait, what do you mean?

01:27:01.080 --> 01:27:03.080
Come on hitbox

01:27:04.400 --> 01:27:06.400
You say I have to chase them around

01:27:06.800 --> 01:27:08.800
I

01:27:18.520 --> 01:27:21.240
If he's already taking off I'm not even near you mate

01:27:22.920 --> 01:27:26.880
I'm running I'm running. I'm cutting corners. I'm cutting

01:27:29.360 --> 01:27:33.880
Wow, I think I'm getting closer

01:27:36.400 --> 01:27:39.000
I think I just got a ton far away because of that jump

01:27:43.160 --> 01:27:45.480
Should I jump off this ledge instead? Oh

01:27:47.840 --> 01:27:52.320
Maybe no, I don't know. I feel like he's getting further away from me and I'm didn't even well, maybe

01:28:01.440 --> 01:28:03.880
No, he's like gaining a speed buff

01:28:04.880 --> 01:28:06.880
Holy moly

01:28:07.440 --> 01:28:10.360
Right, we did it quit the current game

01:28:12.040 --> 01:28:14.040
You mean level

01:28:15.480 --> 01:28:17.480
You mean quit the current level

01:28:18.240 --> 01:28:22.000
Don't forget to like the stream reefless. Oh, I'm so sorry. I'm so bad at saying that

01:28:22.000 --> 01:28:27.080
Oh, yeah, please consider liking and subscribing if you'd like what you see exit level. Yeah

YouTube released an update so if the streamer or the in the video they say like hit that like button the like button

01:29:25.760 --> 01:29:29.240
Lights up on your phone. I don't know if that's a solid thing or not

01:29:30.240 --> 01:29:35.800
When you say smash that but smash that like button the button actually goes up because of speech recognition

01:29:39.080 --> 01:29:45.240

01:34:06.260 --> 01:34:08.260
I'm gonna

01:34:09.460 --> 01:34:14.300
Wait, that's where I came from and that's a dead end that reason I have to go this way

01:34:18.220 --> 01:34:21.140
Says there's something this way if I can get into the cast in

01:34:25.020 --> 01:34:31.140
What kind of do can I not jump up on this ledge how'd I get to it? Let's get to it

01:34:32.220 --> 01:34:34.220
Super charge kills the spider

01:34:37.220 --> 01:34:40.540
Hi, hello, they're just hovering ready to pick me up

01:34:42.620 --> 01:34:44.620
I feel sick

01:34:46.220 --> 01:34:51.580
Motion sicknesses no joke kids take it seriously. Yeah, I'm gonna go back

01:34:55.540 --> 01:34:57.540
That spider chasing

01:35:00.780 --> 01:35:03.380
Oh you too fast

01:35:06.260 --> 01:35:08.260
I

01:35:11.540 --> 01:35:14.700
You see oh, and I just lost the house

01:35:18.300 --> 01:35:20.300
I'll survive

01:35:27.820 --> 01:35:29.820
Oh

01:35:31.340 --> 01:35:33.340
Okay

01:35:34.340 --> 01:35:36.340
Okay

01:35:49.180 --> 01:35:53.180
Then you go get kissed by her again, thank you

01:35:55.980 --> 01:35:57.980
I love in here

01:35:58.460 --> 01:36:00.460
This is a respond I think

01:36:03.340 --> 01:36:05.340
I

01:36:11.540 --> 01:36:13.540
Fight in each other

01:36:17.220 --> 01:36:19.220
You stop that

01:36:20.380 --> 01:36:22.380
Okay, we've got a second

01:36:23.220 --> 01:36:25.300
I've heard that and he has the means can help

01:36:26.340 --> 01:36:28.340
Oh, I'm just wrong

01:36:29.340 --> 01:36:31.340
Burn them all

01:36:31.700 --> 01:36:33.980
He had a subway and you tell me doesn't feel good

01:36:36.500 --> 01:36:42.300
Right what do you guys do you do a big old cross jump

01:36:44.180 --> 01:36:46.180
praying

01:36:46.180 --> 01:36:51.420
Yeah, I'm so sorry. I was like literally throwing up burping everything yesterday

01:36:52.140 --> 01:37:00.260
Nothing came up. Thankfully, but I did have like the gags and I'm afraid I have not fully recovered from my tragic I

01:37:01.980 --> 01:37:05.860
Wasn't supposed to do that or did I just miss by a millisecond?

01:37:07.900 --> 01:37:14.580
One of the levels in this world has a song that eventually used as credit themes in the Amanda show this

01:37:16.580 --> 01:37:18.580
Okay, I just missed I

01:37:19.180 --> 01:37:21.180
I

01:37:28.020 --> 01:37:31.420
Didn't commit and then because I didn't commit I died

01:37:31.420 --> 01:37:35.420
I just thought I should tell you that no, please always hundred percent commit

01:37:36.020 --> 01:37:38.940
Because I just freaking perished over nothing

01:37:39.460 --> 01:37:40.900
So I'm done

01:37:40.900 --> 01:37:42.900
And got scared, okay

01:37:43.940 --> 01:37:45.540
Commit

01:37:45.580 --> 01:37:51.580
I'm going to commit suicide wait, is this got the wagon on it? No

01:37:54.700 --> 01:37:59.220
I'm sorry, it seems a lot harder than I first thought wait, so the dragon isn't there. Oh

01:38:01.460 --> 01:38:04.920
My god, look at my terrible percentages on like everything

01:38:09.180 --> 01:38:11.180
Is it this is it?

01:38:12.140 --> 01:38:14.140
Where's the dead end?

01:38:15.100 --> 01:38:17.100
Other than drills, I guess

01:38:21.380 --> 01:38:23.380
And part in the earth bender

01:38:26.340 --> 01:38:28.740
Yeah, the world basis says hope you mastered gliding

01:38:33.740 --> 01:38:35.740
What a great audience

01:38:38.020 --> 01:38:42.060
I don't know what to think eps drone it is because I feel so sick

01:38:42.780 --> 01:38:45.620
I'm gonna have to change up what I thought my schedule was

01:38:46.340 --> 01:38:48.340
and

01:38:48.780 --> 01:38:53.220
Don't know what to change it to but you'd be nice to myself. I'm probably just gonna end up

01:38:54.300 --> 01:38:56.300
chilling

01:38:57.420 --> 01:39:01.020
Oh, I feel sick. I'm so sorry. It's just come on again that

01:39:02.140 --> 01:39:05.700
Sorry, I keep doing that. That's the only thing I don't like about

01:39:07.980 --> 01:39:11.540
Well, not that someone with like motion sickness, but

01:39:13.020 --> 01:39:19.220
I'm sorry. I'm completely losing. I'm losing my flow. Okay. I'm losing my flow

01:39:26.860 --> 01:39:31.260
Astronauts, you need a break. Yeah, I think this is actually going for my motion sickness

01:39:31.300 --> 01:39:34.020
Which is I just saw that in the corner of my

01:39:35.060 --> 01:39:37.060
Is she be coming up?

01:39:37.140 --> 01:39:39.140
Feel ill

01:39:40.900 --> 01:39:47.180
Who knew my biggest weakness would be fucking automobile and auto bang, but I'm gonna drink some more

01:39:49.460 --> 01:39:52.780
22 minutes. Okay. Well, we do some marshmallows and memem. I

01:39:55.060 --> 01:39:58.220
Don't think she's on today red question mark

01:39:59.900 --> 01:40:01.900
How about I go to oh my god

01:40:02.900 --> 01:40:08.100
I'm sorry. I'm just covering up the game screen right now. I cannot look at that anymore

01:40:10.340 --> 01:40:14.820
That's it's a really really really annoying thing about and

01:40:17.580 --> 01:40:22.580
What all my membership streams from yesterday all got limited ads

01:40:23.580 --> 01:40:25.860
What did I even say anything that was that bad?

01:40:27.300 --> 01:40:29.780
All four of my streams yesterday got limited ads

01:40:32.100 --> 01:40:37.140
Do you want to come over and have a bite? I made cottage pie for the first time. Oh, that's amazing

01:40:37.140 --> 01:40:40.900
You made British food. Is it all brown just like all the British food in the world?

01:40:43.620 --> 01:40:46.520
Amy's actually live for sonic heroes unbelievable

01:40:49.580 --> 01:40:56.700
Okay, let me just make sure that she be definitely isn't coming up and if she's not I'm so sorry. I'll check out

01:40:58.620 --> 01:41:00.620

01:41:01.620 --> 01:41:03.620
What will I check out?

01:41:06.180 --> 01:41:12.260
She's doing smash or pass tomorrow with Toma. Yeah, she's not on

01:41:13.780 --> 01:41:16.340
Hades break. Okay. Okay. I see it

01:41:18.780 --> 01:41:23.660
What are you gonna do after stream probably go back to sleep I feel I still feel real

01:41:25.580 --> 01:41:28.660
And it was it wasn't even the most intense car ride, but

01:41:29.260 --> 01:41:31.980
I've only had five hours sleep. No nap and

01:41:33.420 --> 01:41:35.100
Yeah

01:41:35.100 --> 01:41:40.500
I'm a poor being. What can I say? No way Amy just went offline. Did you?

01:41:41.140 --> 01:41:43.140
Say that coming

01:41:44.140 --> 01:41:48.460
Amy at you may plus. Yeah. Oh wait. I'm saying it wrong. It's I

01:41:54.060 --> 01:41:55.260
I

01:41:55.260 --> 01:41:58.740
Streamed a day ago stream 14 hours ago. Oh, she's coming on. I'll live in

01:42:07.980 --> 01:42:12.900
Miss Mars playing Pokemon run a redirect into miss model think oh

01:42:15.220 --> 01:42:19.980
Hugs and forehead kisses. Hi. I'm so sorry, but bye. I'm about to go

01:42:20.540 --> 01:42:24.380
Don't feel very well. I'll open up marshmallow. Just to see if I can

01:42:25.260 --> 01:42:26.940
questions and that

01:42:26.940 --> 01:42:32.500
Actually, there's been a bit delay on the patreon audios. The girls should have their first one out, but

01:42:33.180 --> 01:42:38.340
We'll get to it. Hi, scrawny. I love you. Don't feel better than I hopefully will feel better by tomorrow

01:42:38.340 --> 01:42:40.340
I think I'll be okay

01:42:40.380 --> 01:42:42.380
Thank you little refund

01:42:42.540 --> 01:42:45.140
Yeah, better. Have a good sleep. Yes, definitely

01:42:45.820 --> 01:42:52.220
If you want a short chill game for next week, maybe look at what remains of Edith Finch

01:42:53.140 --> 01:42:56.220
Curious, I don't think I've heard that or seen gameplay of that game

01:42:57.020 --> 01:43:00.420
Stony, thank you for making my tentacles so happy. Oh, yeah

01:43:01.340 --> 01:43:03.660
Be a little accomplished great things. I'm not

01:43:07.220 --> 01:43:09.220
Glad we could break your tentacle

01:43:10.460 --> 01:43:12.660
Pat pat pat get Wilson. Thank you

01:43:13.020 --> 01:43:18.420
First and foremost, it's a pleasure to finally meet our father-in-law. Let me introduce

01:43:19.220 --> 01:43:24.620
Ourselves. We are the reeflings. Let me tell you that your daughter is the most amazing. Alright, I'll give it to my dad

01:43:24.620 --> 01:43:28.020
Sorry, I won't read out if it's not for me. It's for my dad

01:43:31.460 --> 01:43:37.860
Squids can't extend their tentacles to 20 to 40 ms, which is about 10 times faster than they blink

01:43:37.860 --> 01:43:40.180
They are really impressive since they don't use any

01:43:40.940 --> 01:43:48.340
Spring like mechanism. They only use their powerful muscles for this which can rear be rearranged in a crisscross pattern

01:43:48.340 --> 01:43:54.820
I don't know that imagine a tiny reefling growing a 30-foot tentacle and striking out with it at lightning speeds to defend

01:43:54.820 --> 01:43:58.060
Mummy in danger. That was so wholesome. You could have gone somewhere else with that

01:43:59.180 --> 01:44:01.180
so

01:44:02.180 --> 01:44:04.180
Um

01:44:05.220 --> 01:44:11.260
Normally she be streams and she be doesn't have a public stream today. No, it's okay. Don't worry. Is she doing a member stream today?

01:44:12.380 --> 01:44:14.380
you

01:44:19.820 --> 01:44:23.380
I'm so sorry. I think I'm gonna have to call it there. I really don't feel well

01:44:23.380 --> 01:44:26.700
I promise I'd stream longer if I could but I

01:44:27.580 --> 01:44:32.660
Think I'm ready to throw up and I think I'm doing a mercy modest in the duck again

01:44:33.420 --> 01:44:37.820
My stomach does not feel right. I'm so sorry. I'm gonna redirect into this lovely girl

01:44:37.820 --> 01:44:43.700
I'll say hi for like a millisecond, but I need to go light and I'm so sorry reeflings. I apologize

01:44:44.260 --> 01:44:49.260
But we did we give spiral a little bash. Thank you so much for watching me stumble through this game

01:44:49.500 --> 01:44:56.100
It's very cute. I like it. I'll see you tomorrow. I don't know what the plan the action is tomorrow

01:44:56.100 --> 01:44:59.340
I think the new schedule starts up, but I need to change that way

01:44:59.340 --> 01:45:04.100
But thank you so so much and I'll see you goofy go bers tomorrow. Say hi to a

01:45:04.660 --> 01:45:07.300
For me, okay. Bye. I'm so sorry
