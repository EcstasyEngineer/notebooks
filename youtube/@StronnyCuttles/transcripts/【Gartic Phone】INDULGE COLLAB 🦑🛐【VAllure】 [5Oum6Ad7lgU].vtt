WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:02.000
I'm live. No one say anything bad because I'm live.

00:02.000 --> 00:04.000
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

00:04.000 --> 00:06.000
Okay, I'm live. I'm live.

00:06.000 --> 00:08.000
Okay, okay, okay.

00:10.000 --> 00:12.000
What?

00:12.000 --> 00:14.000
Is it going?

00:14.000 --> 00:16.000
Is it working?

00:16.000 --> 00:18.000
Oh!

00:18.000 --> 00:20.000
I don't know.

00:24.000 --> 00:26.000
You two have been kind of lagging in terms of like moving alive.

00:26.000 --> 00:28.000
Yeah, it takes like a hot second for me to even

00:28.000 --> 00:30.000
appear.

00:30.000 --> 00:32.000
Like when I hit.

00:32.000 --> 00:34.000
Guys, guys, guys, it killed my broadcast room.

00:34.000 --> 00:36.000
What?

00:36.000 --> 00:38.000
You killed your broadcast room?

00:38.000 --> 00:40.000
Right now?

00:40.000 --> 00:42.000
Like it suddenly like stopped streaming and then

00:42.000 --> 00:44.000
my power wash simulator

00:44.000 --> 00:46.000
replay deleted.

00:46.000 --> 00:48.000
I'm live right now.

00:48.000 --> 00:50.000
I'm live right now.

00:50.000 --> 00:52.000
I'm live.

00:52.000 --> 00:54.000
I'm live.

00:54.000 --> 00:56.000
I'm live.

00:56.000 --> 00:58.000
My chat is laughing at us.

00:58.000 --> 01:00.000
Chat, I'm so sorry.

01:00.000 --> 01:02.000
Hello, everybody.

01:02.000 --> 01:04.000
We're so professional.

01:04.000 --> 01:06.000
It's been awful.

01:06.000 --> 01:08.000
How many VLR members

01:08.000 --> 01:10.000
do you need

01:10.000 --> 01:12.000
to do a collab to properly

01:12.000 --> 01:14.000
do a collab to properly.

01:14.000 --> 01:16.000
Merci. Well, I'll meet you in your room.

01:18.000 --> 01:20.000
Yay, she might need a new room.

01:20.000 --> 01:22.000
Hold on.

01:22.000 --> 01:24.000
I'm just eating arrows called

01:24.000 --> 01:26.000
leche live in life.

01:26.000 --> 01:28.000
Sip in a ahoritos.

01:28.000 --> 01:30.000
Hello, everybody.

01:30.000 --> 01:32.000
I'm gonna go make myself some tea while we're living.

01:32.000 --> 01:34.000
No.

01:34.000 --> 01:36.000
Should I die?

01:36.000 --> 01:38.000
Why?

01:38.000 --> 01:40.000
Why?

01:40.000 --> 01:42.000
No, you're okay. You can go make some tea.

01:42.000 --> 01:44.000
She's like, I'm busy.

01:44.000 --> 01:46.000
No, you can fuck this straight.

01:46.000 --> 01:48.000
I'm gonna go make some tea.

01:48.000 --> 01:50.000
You can go make tea.

01:50.000 --> 01:52.000
That's fine.

01:52.000 --> 01:54.000
Oh, we need to help Merci.

01:54.000 --> 01:56.000
Why did this get first stream on?

01:56.000 --> 01:58.000
Guys, we have been at this

01:58.000 --> 02:00.000
for 26 minutes.

02:00.000 --> 02:02.000
We were on Powerwasher

02:02.000 --> 02:04.000
for one hour.

02:04.000 --> 02:06.000
And every time we went past

02:06.000 --> 02:08.000
four of the girls connecting,

02:08.000 --> 02:10.000
the connection

02:10.000 --> 02:12.000
started timing out for some reason.

02:12.000 --> 02:14.000
But if for some reason

02:14.000 --> 02:16.000
in Powerwasher,

02:16.000 --> 02:18.000
if you haven't played the entire campaign,

02:18.000 --> 02:20.000
it doesn't allow you to have

02:20.000 --> 02:22.000
six persons in your lobby.

02:22.000 --> 02:24.000
And I'm the only one with a finished save file.

02:24.000 --> 02:26.000
And it was too late to

02:26.000 --> 02:28.000
ship all the coding information

02:28.000 --> 02:30.000
to send it on

02:30.000 --> 02:32.000
on your stream.

02:32.000 --> 02:34.000
Yeah.

02:34.000 --> 02:36.000
And so basically,

02:36.000 --> 02:38.000
Shebe rescued.

02:38.000 --> 02:40.000
Shebe was like, right, I'll set this one out.

02:40.000 --> 02:42.000
You guys just do it and we're like, no, we can't do it.

02:42.000 --> 02:44.000
The whole point of this is that we're all together in this.

02:44.000 --> 02:46.000
So then we're like, right, who's got Gmod, right?

02:46.000 --> 02:48.000
I don't have it, right? Who's got RAF, right?

02:48.000 --> 02:50.000
Who's got this game? I don't have it.

02:50.000 --> 02:52.000
I was trying my best.

02:52.000 --> 02:54.000
Shebe was like going through the list.

02:54.000 --> 02:56.000
She was flicking them pages like, next page,

02:56.000 --> 02:58.000
next page, next game, next game.

02:58.000 --> 03:00.000
Jackbox. Okay, that won't work.

03:00.000 --> 03:02.000
Literally.

03:02.000 --> 03:04.000
We went, all right, we'll do Jackbox.

03:04.000 --> 03:06.000
And then wait, that requires us

03:06.000 --> 03:08.000
to screen record the discord.

03:08.000 --> 03:10.000
I'm like, we can't have that. We see outrageous things

03:10.000 --> 03:12.000
in the discord. We don't even have a HR department.

03:12.000 --> 03:14.000
So we can't share.

03:14.000 --> 03:16.000
So then,

03:16.000 --> 03:18.000
we have a static phone,

03:18.000 --> 03:20.000
which I've never played before.

03:20.000 --> 03:22.000
It's coming in clutch right now.

03:22.000 --> 03:24.000
Amy's currently making a cup of tea.

03:24.000 --> 03:26.000
Merci

03:26.000 --> 03:28.000
is just

03:28.000 --> 03:30.000
getting

03:30.000 --> 03:32.000
a room set up for her

03:32.000 --> 03:34.000
because

03:34.000 --> 03:36.000
she accidentally nuked her bot

03:36.000 --> 03:38.000
of her

03:38.000 --> 03:40.000
the collab stream.

03:40.000 --> 03:42.000
It was a disaster.

03:42.000 --> 03:44.000
This could have gone

03:44.000 --> 03:46.000
any worse.

03:46.000 --> 03:48.000
So just

03:48.000 --> 03:50.000
I think that's like, pretty on character.

03:50.000 --> 03:52.000
Yeah, if someone can insert

03:52.000 --> 03:54.000
that meme and put all of her hairs on it

03:54.000 --> 03:56.000
and be like, oh, aren't vTubers cute

03:56.000 --> 03:58.000
when they're almost

03:58.000 --> 04:00.000
or a little

04:02.000 --> 04:04.000
That's all I'm going to say. Well, you guys

04:04.000 --> 04:06.000
can finish the sentence after that.

04:06.000 --> 04:08.000
But that was

04:08.000 --> 04:10.000
I can't? No.

04:10.000 --> 04:12.000
Not like that.

04:12.000 --> 04:14.000
The three flings, the snowberries,

04:14.000 --> 04:16.000
the billion hearts,

04:16.000 --> 04:18.000
the harem, I remember I was like, okay,

04:18.000 --> 04:20.000
I'm going to be honest when

04:20.000 --> 04:22.000
the harem told me they were called harem,

04:22.000 --> 04:24.000
I read it as harem and I was like, that makes

04:24.000 --> 04:26.000
no sense for Shiby's character design.

04:26.000 --> 04:28.000
I did too.

04:28.000 --> 04:30.000
I was like, what?

04:30.000 --> 04:32.000
I have a harem

04:32.000 --> 04:34.000
of so many people

04:34.000 --> 04:36.000
that are my little, you know, play things

04:36.000 --> 04:38.000
and clients and they're my harem

04:38.000 --> 04:40.000
and that's hair, which is a rabbit.

04:40.000 --> 04:42.000
But it's not a rabbit. Hair and rabbit are different.

04:42.000 --> 04:44.000
But you know what I mean?

04:44.000 --> 04:46.000
It's a good pun.

04:46.000 --> 04:48.000
It's a pun, exactly.

04:48.000 --> 04:50.000
And they're also called harlets.

04:50.000 --> 04:52.000
Individuals are harlets or harlets.

04:52.000 --> 04:54.000
I thought you said hairless.

04:54.000 --> 04:56.000
They're hairless.

04:56.000 --> 04:58.000
Some of them aren't. I can tell you that.

04:58.000 --> 05:00.000
Maryse, do you still have that

05:00.000 --> 05:02.000
thumbnail, Maryse?

05:02.000 --> 05:04.000
Are we good now?

05:04.000 --> 05:06.000
Almost.

05:06.000 --> 05:08.000
Maryse, do you still have

05:08.000 --> 05:10.000
that thumbnail?

05:10.000 --> 05:12.000
If you just throw up

05:12.000 --> 05:14.000
on the stream.

05:14.000 --> 05:16.000
Is she going to throw up on the stream?

05:16.000 --> 05:18.000
Is it the are you and what are you streaming?

05:18.000 --> 05:20.000
Yeah, it should default to that.

05:20.000 --> 05:22.000
If you just change to the thumbnail

05:22.000 --> 05:24.000
and put garlic on,

05:24.000 --> 05:26.000
I'm literally telling

05:26.000 --> 05:28.000
herself to stream whilst she's streaming.

05:28.000 --> 05:30.000
I'm

05:30.000 --> 05:32.000
dying.

05:32.000 --> 05:34.000
I cannot read that.

05:34.000 --> 05:36.000
Oh.

05:36.000 --> 05:38.000
My goodness gracious.

05:38.000 --> 05:40.000
When are they too loud?

05:40.000 --> 05:42.000
Yeah, how's the volume?

05:42.000 --> 05:44.000
Yeah, it's my volume.

05:44.000 --> 05:46.000
Can you hear everyone else?

05:46.000 --> 05:48.000
Who said the harlets

05:48.000 --> 05:50.000
are waxed in my chat?

05:50.000 --> 05:52.000
What does that even mean?

05:52.000 --> 05:54.000
The harlets are waxed.

05:54.000 --> 05:56.000
I need them to be clean and proper.

05:56.000 --> 05:58.000
Volume good?

05:58.000 --> 06:00.000
I see it.

06:00.000 --> 06:02.000
How do I change the

06:02.000 --> 06:04.000
garlic phone?

06:04.000 --> 06:06.000
On managed broadcast

06:06.000 --> 06:08.000
on OBS?

06:08.000 --> 06:10.000
We're doing so bad.

06:10.000 --> 06:12.000
They called.

06:12.000 --> 06:14.000
We have the column.

06:14.000 --> 06:16.000
Thank you for the 10

06:16.000 --> 06:18.000
members.

06:18.000 --> 06:20.000
10 gifts.

06:20.000 --> 06:22.000
Don't gift right now.

06:22.000 --> 06:24.000
This is awful.

06:24.000 --> 06:26.000
Any gift?

06:26.000 --> 06:28.000
Any gift?

06:28.000 --> 06:30.000
2 o'clock.

06:30.000 --> 06:32.000
Yeah, any gifters for my

06:32.000 --> 06:34.000
non-monetized?

06:34.000 --> 06:36.000
Oh, no.

06:36.000 --> 06:38.000
She, me, and Azur aren't monetized yet.

06:38.000 --> 06:40.000
Oh, my God.

06:40.000 --> 06:42.000
I'm muted.

06:42.000 --> 06:44.000
I was muted the entire time.

06:44.000 --> 06:46.000
Oh, my gosh.

06:46.000 --> 06:48.000
I can mute with her.

06:48.000 --> 06:50.000
We heard you.

06:50.000 --> 06:52.000
No, what is happening?

06:52.000 --> 06:54.000
Oh, what is this?

06:54.000 --> 06:56.000
What is this stream?

06:56.000 --> 06:58.000
This is awful.

06:58.000 --> 07:00.000
This is a

07:00.000 --> 07:02.000
fever dream, guys.

07:02.000 --> 07:04.000
This isn't real.

07:04.000 --> 07:06.000
We're all in bed.

07:06.000 --> 07:08.000
I don't have a garlic phone thing.

07:08.000 --> 07:10.000
I guess I should change my stuff now.

07:10.000 --> 07:12.000
What?

07:12.000 --> 07:14.000
Why do we need to change?

07:14.000 --> 07:16.000
No, you don't have to change anything.

07:16.000 --> 07:18.000
As long as the game is on stream, you can change it after stream.

07:18.000 --> 07:20.000
No one gives a shit what the stream is called.

07:20.000 --> 07:22.000
As long as we're online right now.

07:22.000 --> 07:24.000
Okay.

07:24.000 --> 07:26.000
I'm just doing it.

07:26.000 --> 07:28.000
The girl's running around

07:28.000 --> 07:30.000
like everything's on fire and I'm like,

07:30.000 --> 07:32.000
it'll be fine. We're good.

07:32.000 --> 07:34.000
We're going to play some garlic phone.

07:34.000 --> 07:36.000
We're going to have a great time.

07:36.000 --> 07:38.000
I think the world is going to end.

07:38.000 --> 07:40.000
Don't forget to like and subscribe on this stream

07:40.000 --> 07:42.000
if you're enjoying your experience as a viewer.

07:42.000 --> 07:44.000
Absolutely not.

07:48.000 --> 07:50.000
Smash that bell to get notifications

07:50.000 --> 07:52.000
of when you go live.

07:52.000 --> 07:54.000
Smash that bell to get smashed.

07:54.000 --> 07:56.000
Smash that bell to get smashed.

07:56.000 --> 07:58.000
I see.

07:58.000 --> 08:00.000
I see.

08:00.000 --> 08:02.000
I see.

08:02.000 --> 08:04.000
I see.

08:04.000 --> 08:06.000
Yeah, like with alcohol or something.

08:06.000 --> 08:08.000
Yeah, I am.

08:08.000 --> 08:10.000
Not literally.

08:10.000 --> 08:12.000
I can't help myself.

08:12.000 --> 08:14.000
You love smashing.

08:14.000 --> 08:16.000
Like with the Nigel Thornberry,

08:16.000 --> 08:18.000
she just says smashing.

08:18.000 --> 08:20.000
Like that's it, you know?

08:20.000 --> 08:22.000
Are we here?

08:22.000 --> 08:24.000
are you here?

08:24.000 --> 08:26.000
i'm barely here

08:26.000 --> 08:28.000
are you here?

08:28.000 --> 08:30.000
i'm sorry for the mess

08:30.000 --> 08:32.000
yeah we're here

08:32.000 --> 08:34.000
i'm live now

08:36.000 --> 08:38.000
we at Veilure have done the holistic approach

08:38.000 --> 08:40.000
where none of us will mute

08:40.000 --> 08:42.000
so you're just gonna hear

08:42.000 --> 08:44.000
everything all at once

08:44.000 --> 08:46.000
yeah

08:46.000 --> 08:48.000
that's how we're all

08:48.000 --> 08:50.000
just as a reminder

08:50.000 --> 08:52.000

22:27.080 --> 22:32.080
When your job is a poo, so when your poo hits your prostate on the way out, it feels good.

22:32.080 --> 22:36.080
I love hot pees too.

22:36.080 --> 22:40.080
What is this?

22:40.080 --> 22:43.080
Is Amy's stocking?

22:43.080 --> 22:47.080
Every sucker on them hot toes.

22:47.080 --> 22:50.080
Oh wait, is she giving a blow job?

22:50.080 --> 22:52.080
That's what it looks like.

22:52.080 --> 22:55.080
Percy, what did you draw?

22:55.080 --> 22:57.080
Oh, oh, oh.

22:57.080 --> 23:01.080
Oh my god.

23:01.080 --> 23:04.080
I love the drills. This is so fucking good.

23:04.080 --> 23:06.080
The drills are so good.

23:06.080 --> 23:12.080
Oh boy. We are over some pie.

23:12.080 --> 23:16.080
Okay. That's cute.

23:16.080 --> 23:19.080
I love that. That's a really cute toy.

23:19.080 --> 23:23.080
Is that a cat?

23:24.080 --> 23:27.080
Meow.

23:27.080 --> 23:29.080
Meow winky face.

23:29.080 --> 23:32.080
Okay, it's a winky face. I was like, what is meow us?

23:32.080 --> 23:35.080
I was like, who? No one speaks Spanish. I shouldn't hire anyone.

23:35.080 --> 23:38.080
Speak Spanish?

23:38.080 --> 23:42.080
You're so fucking cute.

23:42.080 --> 23:46.080
Oh, that's good. That's good.

23:46.080 --> 23:49.080
That's good. I love that.

23:50.080 --> 23:53.080
Oh.

23:53.080 --> 23:56.080
Okay, this makes sense.

23:56.080 --> 23:59.080
This makes sense of what on earth we were drawing.

23:59.080 --> 24:02.080
That's a check out and that's items on the shelves.

24:02.080 --> 24:05.080
I worked really hard.

24:05.080 --> 24:08.080
I didn't get that.

24:08.080 --> 24:11.080
This is like a diaper.

24:11.080 --> 24:14.080
I see you understood me.

24:14.080 --> 24:17.080
Oh my god.

24:17.080 --> 24:20.080
Oh, I love the details.

24:20.080 --> 24:23.080
Shut up.

24:23.080 --> 24:26.080
Seriously.

24:26.080 --> 24:29.080
I was coming out of his back.

24:29.080 --> 24:32.080
I was going everywhere.

24:32.080 --> 24:35.080
I can't.

24:35.080 --> 24:38.080
I had to do the toilet stall gap.

24:38.080 --> 24:41.080
That's all I see about when I see American memes.

24:41.080 --> 24:44.080
Oh, the toilet is taller.

24:44.080 --> 24:47.080
The toilet is so big you can literally look at people's eyes.

24:47.080 --> 24:50.080
Is it a different version?

24:50.080 --> 24:53.080
We have them closed because it's a private time

24:53.080 --> 24:56.080
and you're very vulnerable taking a big job.

24:56.080 --> 24:59.080
It's actually closed everywhere else in the planet.

24:59.080 --> 25:02.080
Oh, you're so lucky.

25:02.080 --> 25:05.080
I had people peeking at me in high school through the stalls

25:05.080 --> 25:08.080
and I'm like, can I help you?

25:08.080 --> 25:11.080
Me too.

25:11.080 --> 25:14.080
Is there a check?

25:14.080 --> 25:17.080
Is there a DC check?

25:17.080 --> 25:20.080
Are you in the lobby?

25:20.080 --> 25:23.080
It's going to do it on its own usually.

25:23.080 --> 25:26.080
No, I'm gone.

25:26.080 --> 25:29.080
The link should be in the discord.

25:29.080 --> 25:32.080
Don't show your fucking screen on the discord.

25:32.080 --> 25:35.080
They'll see all of our naughty photos

25:35.080 --> 25:38.080
we just sent to each other.

25:38.080 --> 25:41.080
It's mostly memes.

25:41.080 --> 25:44.080
I mean, to be fair, we did share...

25:44.080 --> 25:47.080
We did share some funny memes.

25:47.080 --> 25:50.080
We did share some lucky nudes of ours.

25:50.080 --> 25:53.080
They see my titties.

25:53.080 --> 25:56.080
I started roleplaying as the girls with my nudes.

25:56.080 --> 25:59.080
I was like, this is what Emmy would do.

25:59.080 --> 26:02.080
This is what AC would do.

26:02.080 --> 26:05.080
The discord is so chaotic.

26:06.080 --> 26:09.080
Also, I did snort out my tea.

26:09.080 --> 26:12.080
It went down the wrong hole and went up my nose.

26:12.080 --> 26:15.080
Wow, Marcy, I hear you snort in tea.

26:15.080 --> 26:18.080
This is what you hear.

26:18.080 --> 26:21.080
Gotta lay off that testosterone.

26:21.080 --> 26:24.080
It hurts so much.

26:24.080 --> 26:27.080
Are you in game?

26:27.080 --> 26:30.080
I posted the link in the chat.

26:30.080 --> 26:33.080
That's why you guys were in my arms.

26:33.080 --> 26:36.080
I'm getting another heart beat right now.

26:36.080 --> 26:39.080
Every time she talks.

26:39.080 --> 26:42.080
Avatar nudes are eye around nudes.

26:42.080 --> 26:45.080
What do you think?

26:45.080 --> 26:48.080
Oopsie.

26:48.080 --> 26:51.080
Oopsie.

26:51.080 --> 26:54.080
I feel like Azura could do a really good

26:54.080 --> 26:57.080
Jennifer Coolidge impression.

26:57.080 --> 27:00.080
Me too.

27:00.080 --> 27:03.080
You don't know Jennifer Coolidge?

27:03.080 --> 27:06.080
Jennifer Coolidge.

27:06.080 --> 27:09.080
You don't know Jennifer Coolidge?

27:09.080 --> 27:12.080
Jennifer Coolidge.

27:12.080 --> 27:15.080
I'm such a big titty.

27:15.080 --> 27:18.080
Oh my God.

27:18.080 --> 27:21.080
Oh my God.

27:21.080 --> 27:24.080
Jennifer Coolidge.

27:24.080 --> 27:27.080
That's so good.

27:27.080 --> 27:29.080
Why are we opening our God for the left way?

27:29.080 --> 27:31.080
You're a G-boy, they're Razzlers.

27:31.080 --> 27:32.080
Azura!

27:32.080 --> 27:33.080
Drop the base!

27:33.080 --> 27:34.080
Blah, blah!

27:34.080 --> 27:39.080
Azura, click that link in the general discord to re-add.

27:39.080 --> 27:41.080
Is it not letting you back in?

27:41.080 --> 27:43.080
Are you being re-gained?

27:43.080 --> 27:44.080
No!

27:44.080 --> 27:45.080
I'm not!

27:45.080 --> 27:46.080
I'm not!

27:46.080 --> 27:47.080
I'm not!

27:47.080 --> 27:48.080
Eh?

27:48.080 --> 27:50.080
What is happening?!

27:50.080 --> 27:52.080
You're making...

27:52.080 --> 27:55.080
Your make cuts out when you do that Azura, so it just goes

27:55.080 --> 27:56.080
EW!

27:56.080 --> 27:57.080
EW!

27:57.080 --> 27:58.080
EW!

27:58.080 --> 27:59.080
EW!

27:59.080 --> 28:00.080
What's happening?

28:00.080 --> 28:03.080
I don't even know what's happening anymore.

28:03.080 --> 28:05.080
It's constantly loading, it says...

28:05.080 --> 28:06.080
Did you?

28:06.080 --> 28:07.080
No.

28:07.080 --> 28:08.080
Right.

28:08.080 --> 28:09.080
It's literally...

28:09.080 --> 28:12.080
Let me do another invite and members.

28:12.080 --> 28:13.080
I'm sorry.

28:13.080 --> 28:14.080
I'm sorry.

28:14.080 --> 28:15.080
Will you guys see the discord if I open it?

28:15.080 --> 28:16.080
Okay, you guys can't see it.

28:16.080 --> 28:17.080
No, if you do window capture...

28:17.080 --> 28:18.080
I'm sorry.

28:18.080 --> 28:19.080
It's open.

28:19.080 --> 28:21.080
I shouldn't see anything else.

28:21.080 --> 28:25.080
I would close the window capture in the OBS just in case.

28:25.080 --> 28:27.080
Yes, you can open it off.

28:27.080 --> 28:29.080
Are we starting a new lobby?

28:29.080 --> 28:31.080
A new lobby?

28:31.080 --> 28:34.080
I think we should all invite to this lobby.

28:34.080 --> 28:35.080
A bit of a...

28:35.080 --> 28:37.080
Lights are too heavy.

28:37.080 --> 28:39.080
Are we going to a different room?

28:39.080 --> 28:40.080
I don't know.

28:40.080 --> 28:41.080
Lights are too heavy.

28:41.080 --> 28:42.080
What is happening?

28:42.080 --> 28:44.080
I only see one of you.

28:44.080 --> 28:46.080
No, I'm on my end, sorry.

28:46.080 --> 28:47.080
A new one?

28:47.080 --> 28:48.080
Ah, there's...

28:48.080 --> 28:50.080
Wait, my voice is in.

28:50.080 --> 28:51.080
Where is it?

28:51.080 --> 28:52.080
Where is it?

28:52.080 --> 28:53.080
Where is it?

28:53.080 --> 28:55.080
Okay, which one should we play?

28:55.080 --> 28:56.080
Which one?

28:56.080 --> 28:57.080
Normal.

28:57.080 --> 28:58.080
Which we just did.

28:58.080 --> 28:59.080
Knock off.

28:59.080 --> 29:00.080
Keep yourself focused.

29:00.080 --> 29:04.080
Try to replicate the drawings while the clock gets faster.

29:04.080 --> 29:06.080
Create an animation in a collaborative way.

29:06.080 --> 29:07.080
Icebreaker.

29:07.080 --> 29:08.080
Play with a sentence.

29:08.080 --> 29:10.080
Ask questions and have fun with other drawings.

29:10.080 --> 29:11.080
Exquisite corpse.

29:11.080 --> 29:14.080
Create surrealist characters connected by the top of the drawings.

29:14.080 --> 29:15.080
Don't know what that means.

29:15.080 --> 29:16.080
Hold on.

29:16.080 --> 29:17.080
I have no idea.

29:17.080 --> 29:18.080
Burp friends, have a good time with that.

29:18.080 --> 29:19.080
Compliment.

29:19.080 --> 29:21.080
Complete the sketch.

29:21.080 --> 29:24.080
Start with basic lines and see other players' interpretations.

29:24.080 --> 29:25.080
Masterpiece.

29:25.080 --> 29:26.080
Create a piece of art.

29:26.080 --> 29:28.080
Play in a single turn with no time limit.

29:28.080 --> 29:30.080
I feel like story would be funny.

29:30.080 --> 29:33.080
Write a narrative using only the previous sentence as a reference.

29:33.080 --> 29:34.080
Yes, okay, okay.

29:34.080 --> 29:35.080
Story, story, story.

29:35.080 --> 29:36.080
Okay, okay.

29:36.080 --> 29:37.080
You want to do story?

29:37.080 --> 29:38.080
Okay.

29:38.080 --> 29:39.080
Yeah, let's try story.

29:39.080 --> 29:41.080
What are you doing?

29:41.080 --> 29:43.080
Start writing a story.

29:43.080 --> 29:53.080
Wait, do I have to write a full story or just a sentence?

29:53.080 --> 29:54.080
Just a sentence.

29:54.080 --> 29:55.080
Just one sentence.

29:55.080 --> 29:56.080
Okay, okay.

29:56.080 --> 29:57.080
Fuck you.

29:57.080 --> 30:01.080
Do you like write the whole story or no?

30:01.080 --> 30:04.080
No, you have really limited characters.

30:04.080 --> 30:09.080
I don't know it.

30:09.080 --> 30:10.080
No!

30:10.080 --> 30:12.080
What did you do?

30:12.080 --> 30:13.080
There's time.

30:13.080 --> 30:14.080
There's time.

30:14.080 --> 30:15.080
15 seconds, love.

30:15.080 --> 30:16.080
Oh my God.

30:16.080 --> 30:17.080
I wanted to write more.

30:17.080 --> 30:18.080
I wanted to write more.

30:18.080 --> 30:19.080
Only write one sentence.

30:19.080 --> 30:20.080
Fuck.

30:20.080 --> 30:21.080
All these stories.

30:21.080 --> 30:22.080
Shit.

30:22.080 --> 30:23.080
I feel like I should have drowned.

30:23.080 --> 30:24.080

31:27.080 --> 31:31.080
Oh, oh the sentence is so small like I want to give a bit more

31:33.080 --> 31:35.080
Me too, but it's too short

31:36.080 --> 31:38.080
I think I got shorter over time

31:39.080 --> 31:41.080

32:04.080 --> 32:05.080
Fuck

32:06.080 --> 32:08.080
Fuck, I'm so bad at this

32:08.080 --> 32:10.080
I'm not soft neighboring

32:11.080 --> 32:12.080
Fuck

32:12.080 --> 32:13.080
Her name

32:13.080 --> 32:15.080
It's funny because like

32:15.080 --> 32:17.080
I hate this, I can't think of anything else

32:17.080 --> 32:18.080
The regangs, the snowberries

32:18.080 --> 32:19.080
Fuck my life

32:19.080 --> 32:21.080
The pin pals

32:21.080 --> 32:25.080
The bleeding hearts and the harem all get to see this unfold

32:25.080 --> 32:27.080
And we're all just taping like

32:28.080 --> 32:30.080
Fuck it, I don't fucking know

32:32.080 --> 32:34.080
Wait, is that the fucking

32:43.080 --> 32:48.080
You watch fucking Big Bang Theory

32:48.080 --> 32:50.080
Wait, that's not how you spell it

32:50.080 --> 32:51.080
Paris

32:54.080 --> 32:55.080
Fuck

32:55.080 --> 32:57.080
Give me more

33:02.080 --> 33:04.080
I need more letters

33:04.080 --> 33:06.080
I need more like

33:06.080 --> 33:08.080
I can't find anything

33:08.080 --> 33:10.080
What am I doing?

33:10.080 --> 33:11.080
Writer

33:11.080 --> 33:13.080
They can't spin song lyrics

33:13.080 --> 33:15.080
They jerk so hard mother fuckers want to find me

33:16.080 --> 33:18.080
That sounds like she made me

33:19.080 --> 33:20.080
No

33:21.080 --> 33:25.080
Did you hear it so hard mother fuckers want to find me

33:25.080 --> 33:26.080
Wait

33:26.080 --> 33:28.080
I don't know this lyric

33:28.080 --> 33:30.080
This agency

33:31.080 --> 33:33.080
We can't just

33:33.080 --> 33:34.080
This agency

33:34.080 --> 33:36.080
I spelled it wrong but that's the point

33:37.080 --> 33:41.080
I hate that like they don't give you enough to write

33:41.080 --> 33:42.080
Like

33:42.080 --> 33:44.080
This is not enough

33:44.080 --> 33:46.080
Bro, fuck off

33:47.080 --> 33:51.080
Oh boy, okay, let's see what's happening

33:55.080 --> 33:57.080
So how about everybody reads their own story

33:57.080 --> 33:59.080
Whoever did the first line

33:59.080 --> 34:00.080
Okay, cool

34:00.080 --> 34:01.080
Okay

34:01.080 --> 34:02.080
Oh, okay, I go first

34:02.080 --> 34:06.080
In a galaxy far far away there was a goat with big titties

34:06.080 --> 34:10.080
She had so much milkers and started raining milk

34:11.080 --> 34:15.080
Azara then went home to make an empire being milked daily

34:16.080 --> 34:20.080
It was so successful the neighboring kingdoms became champions

34:20.080 --> 34:23.080
They also wanted so much juicy

34:25.080 --> 34:27.080
Ew cooties, you're not good

34:27.080 --> 34:29.080
Good, good, you're not good

34:33.080 --> 34:34.080
Oh boy

34:34.080 --> 34:37.080
Okay, long time ago in a chemical farm

34:37.080 --> 34:38.080
Yeah

34:39.080 --> 34:42.080
There was a polar bear princess who was trying to fit into

34:47.080 --> 34:50.080
Their love was stronger than any foreign addiction

34:50.080 --> 34:53.080
They couldn't stop chewing on themselves from drinking

34:53.080 --> 34:56.080
They drink so high in my fucking stomach

35:01.080 --> 35:03.080
I didn't know I would finish it

35:03.080 --> 35:05.080
I was like, this agency, okay

35:06.080 --> 35:07.080
Ding ding

35:07.080 --> 35:09.080
That was supposed to be the song like ding ding

35:09.080 --> 35:10.080
Ding ding

35:10.080 --> 35:11.080
Oh my god

35:11.080 --> 35:12.080
Ding ding

35:12.080 --> 35:13.080
Balls so hard

35:14.080 --> 35:16.080
Strani, who was in Paris?

35:16.080 --> 35:18.080
I typed Azara

35:18.080 --> 35:20.080
I typed Azara, I'm sorry

35:22.080 --> 35:25.080
There was a beach of agency that was lit

35:26.080 --> 35:30.080
They all couldn't control their urges to pass

35:31.080 --> 35:34.080
So they danced the pee-pee dance until they could

35:35.080 --> 35:38.080
And then finally they peed everywhere on the

35:40.080 --> 35:43.080
Floor, the walls, the bed, the kite

35:45.080 --> 35:48.080
We're all full of piss everywhere, but he loved it

35:48.080 --> 35:52.080
The fact that there was not even a piss prompt before AC came out with that

35:52.080 --> 35:56.080
Literally there was only AC came out with one

35:56.080 --> 35:58.080
AC came out with one

35:58.080 --> 36:00.080
AC came out with one

36:01.080 --> 36:04.080
That character added

36:04.080 --> 36:05.080
This is so good

36:05.080 --> 36:06.080
Okay

36:06.080 --> 36:07.080
Okay

36:07.080 --> 36:10.080
Once upon a time there were whores

36:10.080 --> 36:12.080
They were the eliters of whores

36:12.080 --> 36:14.080
A cow from the wild west

36:14.080 --> 36:16.080
All the really cute cowgirl

36:16.080 --> 36:19.080
Pussycat, so cute, so funny

36:19.080 --> 36:21.080
So pussywarm

36:21.080 --> 36:26.080
Big bang theory, more like bang bang your mom last time

36:27.080 --> 36:30.080
You keep my mom out of your home now

36:30.080 --> 36:32.080
I'm sorry

36:32.080 --> 36:34.080
10 out of 10

36:36.080 --> 36:38.080
Once upon a time there was a pig

36:38.080 --> 36:41.080
Oh, no

36:41.080 --> 36:43.080
Oh, no

36:46.080 --> 36:48.080
Oh, no, okay, this one

36:48.080 --> 36:50.080
Oh, no

36:50.080 --> 36:52.080
Please, no

36:56.080 --> 36:58.080
Oh, no

36:58.080 --> 37:00.080
Oh, no

37:00.080 --> 37:02.080
Oh, no

37:02.080 --> 37:04.080
Oh, no

37:04.080 --> 37:06.080
Oh, no

37:06.080 --> 37:08.080
Oh, no

37:08.080 --> 37:10.080
Oh, my face hurts from blood

37:10.080 --> 37:12.080
Oh, this is so good

37:12.080 --> 37:15.080
Oh, what the fuck

37:15.080 --> 37:18.080
And now you guys know why I rate the scripts in Vila or nothing

37:18.080 --> 37:20.080
Why?

37:20.080 --> 37:22.080
Because we had a zero vote of each other

37:22.080 --> 37:27.080
You were sad because you realized you didn't have a prostate

37:30.080 --> 37:33.080
Why do I keep talking about shit all the time?

37:36.080 --> 37:38.080
She became so bad

37:38.080 --> 37:40.080
I hate this

37:40.080 --> 37:42.080
Fuck, no

37:42.080 --> 37:44.080
Pain

37:44.080 --> 37:47.080
No, I didn't want to be pregnant by Sonic

37:47.080 --> 37:49.080
Ezra, do you have a make filter on?

37:49.080 --> 37:51.080
I can never hear you

37:51.080 --> 37:53.080
Turn that mic

37:53.080 --> 37:55.080
Get that SteelSeries

37:55.080 --> 37:57.080
See that SteelSeries

37:57.080 --> 37:59.080
I don't have a filter on

37:59.080 --> 38:01.080
Don't have a filter on

38:01.080 --> 38:03.080
There's no filter on?

38:03.080 --> 38:05.080
What is happening?

38:05.080 --> 38:07.080
Your SteelSeries filter

38:07.080 --> 38:09.080
Open up

38:09.080 --> 38:11.080
I don't have a filter

38:11.080 --> 38:13.080
I definitely can't hear you

38:13.080 --> 38:15.080
What is happening?

38:15.080 --> 38:17.080
Can't wait for the VOD if they survive

38:17.080 --> 38:19.080
Yeah, these VODs

38:19.080 --> 38:21.080
They'll be fine

38:21.080 --> 38:23.080
Don't worry about it

38:23.080 --> 38:25.080
If you guys want to play this one

38:25.080 --> 38:27.080
Or do you want to try another one?

38:27.080 --> 38:29.080
Another one

38:29.080 --> 38:31.080
Please, no more shit

38:31.080 --> 38:33.080
No more shit in Piss

38:33.080 --> 38:35.080
No more shit still

38:35.080 --> 38:37.080
No promises

38:37.080 --> 38:39.080
No promises

38:41.080 --> 38:43.080
Should we do a compliment?

38:45.080 --> 38:47.080
Compliment

38:47.080 --> 38:49.080
Actions are a mystery

38:49.080 --> 38:51.080
Drawings and sentences are hidden

38:51.080 --> 38:53.080
You can't hear MercyTest

38:53.080 --> 38:55.080
Sorry

38:55.080 --> 38:57.080
I was muting because I was coughing

38:57.080 --> 38:59.080
Because I was laughing

38:59.080 --> 39:01.080
My sides were so badly

39:01.080 --> 39:03.080
Okay, MercyTest complete

39:03.080 --> 39:05.080
Do you want to do compliment?

39:07.080 --> 39:09.080
What is that?

39:09.080 --> 39:11.080
We draw on each other's drawings

39:11.080 --> 39:13.080
Basically

39:13.080 --> 39:15.080
I think that would be fun

39:15.080 --> 39:17.080
Wow

39:17.080 --> 39:19.080
I can't wait to draw so much piss

39:19.080 --> 39:21.080
That's some basic lines

39:21.080 --> 39:23.080
Start sketching some basic lines

39:23.080 --> 39:25.080
Okay

39:25.080 --> 39:27.080
Let me do this

39:31.080 --> 39:33.080
Maybe I could do some basic lines

39:33.080 --> 39:35.080
Like

39:41.080 --> 39:43.080
Great, now I'm just going to draw a bunch of dicks

39:43.080 --> 39:45.080
I just blew that

39:45.080 --> 39:47.080
Picasso

39:49.080 --> 39:51.080
Are you joking?

39:51.080 --> 39:53.080
Who is that?

39:53.080 --> 39:55.080
Fuckers

39:55.080 --> 39:57.080
Do you know exactly what you did?

39:57.080 --> 39:59.080
No, I don't have the strength to resist

40:01.080 --> 40:03.080
What?

40:03.080 --> 40:05.080
I got it, I can make this

40:05.080 --> 40:07.080
I can salvage this

40:07.080 --> 40:09.080
This is the back legs

40:09.080 --> 40:11.080
of it

40:11.080 --> 40:13.080
Those huge milkers

40:19.080 --> 40:21.080
There you go

40:23.080 --> 40:25.080
You're so dirty

40:25.080 --> 40:27.080
Don't be so dirty

40:29.080 --> 40:31.080
I'll get the girls to tell you off

40:31.080 --> 40:33.080
if you don't behave

40:33.080 --> 40:35.080
You guys don't have innocent eyes anymore

40:41.080 --> 40:43.080
You're so dirty

40:45.080 --> 40:47.080
Rude to me

40:49.080 --> 40:51.080
Wait, am I supposed to finish this off?

40:53.080 --> 40:55.080
Are we supposed to finish it off?

40:55.080 --> 40:57.080
I think so because it's given us tons of time

40:57.080 --> 40:59.080
Hold on

41:03.080 --> 41:05.080
I fixed it

41:05.080 --> 41:07.080
I fixed it

41:07.080 --> 41:09.080
Hello

41:09.080 --> 41:11.080
A big push up bro

41:11.080 --> 41:13.080
Oh my god, I've just made shibby

41:15.080 --> 41:17.080
What the hell?

41:17.080 --> 41:19.080
I heard my name

41:19.080 --> 41:21.080
Oh wait, that's the thing

41:23.080 --> 41:25.080
Dang it

41:25.080 --> 41:27.080
Give me the pencil

41:27.080 --> 41:29.080
There you go

41:29.080 --> 41:31.080
I saved it

41:31.080 --> 41:33.080
I saved it

41:33.080 --> 41:35.080
They give you a lot more time

41:35.080 --> 41:37.080
Yeah, you're to finish it

41:39.080 --> 41:41.080
Okay, I'm fucking stupid

41:41.080 --> 41:43.080
Never mind

41:43.080 --> 41:45.080
So am I, don't worry

41:45.080 --> 41:47.080
Saved it

41:47.080 --> 41:49.080
Oh my god

41:51.080 --> 41:53.080
Let's put some nice shading in

41:53.080 --> 41:55.080
To make this look extra beautiful

41:57.080 --> 41:59.080
Wow

41:59.080 --> 42:01.080
Let's put lipstick on them

42:01.080 --> 42:03.080
The beauty of nature

42:03.080 --> 42:05.080
I think

42:07.080 --> 42:09.080
I saved it

42:11.080 --> 42:13.080
They prank him

42:13.080 --> 42:15.080
I think this is the best I got

42:15.080 --> 42:17.080
I'm good

42:21.080 --> 42:23.080
Who drew a pair of hairy ball sacks?

42:23.080 --> 42:25.080
Come on

42:25.080 --> 42:27.080
What the fuck

42:27.080 --> 42:29.080
What am I supposed to do?

42:29.080 --> 42:31.080
Oh these are all

42:31.080 --> 42:33.080
The shaft

42:35.080 --> 42:37.080
Oh, I really know what I want to do

42:37.080 --> 42:39.080
But I know I shouldn't do it

42:39.080 --> 42:41.080
Because we're on YouTube

42:41.080 --> 42:43.080
I'm fixing this

42:45.080 --> 42:47.080
Oh no

42:47.080 --> 42:49.080
I can't think of one thing

42:49.080 --> 42:51.080
This is amazing

42:51.080 --> 42:53.080
Oh wait, maybe

42:53.080 --> 42:55.080
Hold on, hold on

42:55.080 --> 42:57.080
I got it

42:57.080 --> 42:59.080
I got it

42:59.080 --> 43:01.080
Fuck, how do I go back?

43:01.080 --> 43:03.080
Okay

43:05.080 --> 43:07.080
They've got a big head

43:15.080 --> 43:17.080
This is so fucking good

43:17.080 --> 43:19.080
Let's fucking go

43:21.080 --> 43:23.080
I'm trying so hard right now

43:23.080 --> 43:25.080
I can't even think of anything to say

43:25.080 --> 43:27.080
I'm trying so hard

43:29.080 --> 43:31.080
Oh my gosh

43:31.080 --> 43:33.080
Use your imagination

43:33.080 --> 43:35.080
Use your imagination

43:43.080 --> 43:45.080
There you go

43:45.080 --> 43:47.080
Look at you all

43:47.080 --> 43:49.080
I'm so proud of you

43:51.080 --> 43:53.080
I'm gonna kick your head

43:53.080 --> 43:55.080
Alright

43:55.080 --> 43:57.080
We need to be nice to the workers

43:57.080 --> 43:59.080
Your lap is so cute

43:59.080 --> 44:01.080
I see

44:01.080 --> 44:03.080
Thank you

44:03.080 --> 44:05.080
I love you so much

44:05.080 --> 44:07.080
Aw, that's so sweet

44:07.080 --> 44:09.080
I think I did mine really well

44:11.080 --> 44:13.080
Yeah, it's a water bottle

44:19.080 --> 44:21.080
That's the best I got

44:21.080 --> 44:23.080
I need

44:23.080 --> 44:25.080
I saved the pair of all sex

44:31.080 --> 44:33.080
Did you make it into a dog or something?

44:33.080 --> 44:35.080
No

44:35.080 --> 44:37.080
I don't know how about you

44:37.080 --> 44:39.080
Senpai, can you do better? Shut the fuck up

44:41.080 --> 44:43.080
I love when you do that

44:45.080 --> 44:47.080
Oh my god

44:47.080 --> 44:49.080
What is this?

44:49.080 --> 44:51.080
I got the pair of all sex

44:51.080 --> 44:53.080
We can hold on

44:53.080 --> 44:55.080
You're asking me not to draw the gynecologist

44:59.080 --> 45:01.080
What do I do?

45:01.080 --> 45:03.080
What can we do here?

45:03.080 --> 45:05.080
What can we do here?

45:07.080 --> 45:09.080
How do I make this? How do I save this?

45:17.080 --> 45:19.080
I need to do this

45:19.080 --> 45:21.080
I need to do this all for a minute

45:21.080 --> 45:23.080
Okay, I won't draw that

45:23.080 --> 45:25.080
Cause that would be

45:25.080 --> 45:27.080
Oh my god

45:27.080 --> 45:29.080
I just realized

45:29.080 --> 45:31.080
I'll draw this in the stud

45:31.080 --> 45:33.080
I'm gonna fucking snip it

45:33.080 --> 45:35.080
From Star Wars

45:37.080 --> 45:39.080
Oh wait, no, is it heartbreak on the chest?

45:39.080 --> 45:41.080
I saved it

45:41.080 --> 45:43.080
I saved it

45:43.080 --> 45:45.080
I saw women were less immature than men

45:45.080 --> 45:47.080
No

45:49.080 --> 45:51.080
I was gonna draw

45:51.080 --> 45:53.080
a kuchi or a woman giving birth

45:53.080 --> 45:55.080
I don't know what the fuck I'm doing

45:55.080 --> 45:57.080
I literally don't know what the fuck

45:57.080 --> 45:59.080
I'm doing right now

45:59.080 --> 46:01.080
There we go

46:01.080 --> 46:03.080
They need this

46:03.080 --> 46:05.080
Oh my god, I have time

46:09.080 --> 46:11.080
I don't know what the fuck I'm doing

46:11.080 --> 46:13.080
What are you doing?

46:13.080 --> 46:15.080
What?

46:21.080 --> 46:23.080
And then

46:23.080 --> 46:25.080
Pen pals

46:25.080 --> 46:27.080
Pen pals

46:27.080 --> 46:29.080
Pen pals

46:29.080 --> 46:31.080
Quick, quick, quick

46:31.080 --> 46:33.080
I'm running out of time

46:35.080 --> 46:37.080
Oh my god

46:37.080 --> 46:39.080
This is okay

46:39.080 --> 46:41.080
This is okay

46:43.080 --> 46:45.080
These are light ones

46:51.080 --> 46:53.080
I'm trying, I'm trying, I'm trying

46:53.080 --> 46:55.080
I got it, I got it

47:01.080 --> 47:03.080
These are light ones

47:03.080 --> 47:05.080
I saved it

47:05.080 --> 47:07.080
I saved it

47:11.080 --> 47:13.080
I saved it

47:13.080 --> 47:15.080
I saved it

47:15.080 --> 47:17.080
I think I did a good job

47:17.080 --> 47:19.080
This is the best I got

47:19.080 --> 47:21.080
I ain't got nothing

47:21.080 --> 47:23.080
No

47:23.080 --> 47:25.080
You know what?

47:25.080 --> 47:27.080
Why do I feel like

47:29.080 --> 47:31.080
This is a really specific reference

47:31.080 --> 47:33.080
And I don't know if anyone's gonna get it

47:33.080 --> 47:35.080
But there used to be

47:35.080 --> 47:37.080
A little flash game

47:37.080 --> 47:39.080
Where your guy was on like a snowboard

47:39.080 --> 47:41.080
I love that game

47:41.080 --> 47:43.080
I know what you're talking about

47:43.080 --> 47:45.080
Someone who literally just drawn that

47:45.080 --> 47:47.080
Literally this is perfect

47:53.080 --> 47:55.080
That's it, that's the drawing

47:57.080 --> 47:59.080
Someone says lane raider

47:59.080 --> 48:01.080
Oh I thought we're just called

48:01.080 --> 48:03.080
lane

48:11.080 --> 48:13.080
What is bear pantsu?

48:23.080 --> 48:25.080
I thought people were asking me

48:25.080 --> 48:27.080
To draw a bear wearing underwear

48:27.080 --> 48:29.080
I was like what the fuck is wrong

48:29.080 --> 48:31.080
With you guys

48:35.080 --> 48:37.080
Cause he had big old pants

48:37.080 --> 48:39.080
That were fancy

48:43.080 --> 48:45.080
You know the story

48:47.080 --> 48:49.080
You know the story

48:51.080 --> 48:53.080
I might make that up

48:57.080 --> 48:59.080
Hydration check girl

48:59.080 --> 49:01.080
You don't want your balls to shine

49:01.080 --> 49:03.080
Okay

49:03.080 --> 49:05.080
You know the story

49:05.080 --> 49:07.080
Some water

49:13.080 --> 49:15.080
He's drooling my balls

49:15.080 --> 49:17.080
He had no hair color

49:17.080 --> 49:19.080
Let me do that

49:19.080 --> 49:21.080
Do you have a beard? I don't know

49:21.080 --> 49:23.080
I drew something

49:27.080 --> 49:29.080
Yeah you're right

49:29.080 --> 49:31.080
I don't really know how to do that though

49:31.080 --> 49:33.080
Can I zoom in?

49:33.080 --> 49:35.080
No

49:35.080 --> 49:37.080
Yeah

49:39.080 --> 49:41.080
Someone said bear braid

49:41.080 --> 49:43.080
Braid is pantsu

49:43.080 --> 49:45.080
Wait what happens

49:49.080 --> 49:51.080
No fuck I didn't mean that

49:51.080 --> 49:53.080
Who drew ball sacks everywhere

49:53.080 --> 49:55.080
It's not you shivy

49:55.080 --> 49:57.080
I only see boobs

49:57.080 --> 49:59.080
No I didn't draw a ball sack

50:03.080 --> 50:05.080
I got it

50:07.080 --> 50:09.080
Who's whispering

50:09.080 --> 50:11.080
I have no idea

50:11.080 --> 50:13.080
What?

50:13.080 --> 50:15.080
There is whispering some like

50:15.080 --> 50:17.080
Evil incantations

50:19.080 --> 50:21.080
I'm sorry

50:21.080 --> 50:23.080
That's not nice

50:25.080 --> 50:27.080
It was definitely Azura that drew the ball sack

50:27.080 --> 50:29.080
100%

50:31.080 --> 50:33.080
Why do I feel like this is a lie

50:33.080 --> 50:35.080
No I didn't draw it

50:35.080 --> 50:37.080
I'm really drawing over it right now

50:37.080 --> 50:39.080
If you guys didn't know

50:39.080 --> 50:41.080
Azura's ears actually have

50:41.080 --> 50:43.080
Gold little jewelry

50:43.080 --> 50:45.080
On the end of them

50:47.080 --> 50:49.080
Pimped out with jewelry

50:49.080 --> 50:51.080
It's like not a vanity thing

50:51.080 --> 50:53.080
It's like gifts

50:53.080 --> 50:55.080
Going for her first

50:55.080 --> 50:57.080
Bike ride

50:57.080 --> 50:59.080
Isn't cheating to erase

50:59.080 --> 51:01.080
Aw fuck it is

51:01.080 --> 51:03.080
Isn't it cute

51:03.080 --> 51:05.080
So if you didn't know

51:05.080 --> 51:07.080
When a women

51:07.080 --> 51:09.080
When a women like tates chat

51:09.080 --> 51:11.080
Here we'll have a

51:11.080 --> 51:13.080
It goes through the fabric

51:13.080 --> 51:15.080
So they'll be like a big lady

51:15.080 --> 51:17.080
Oh she's so happy for her

51:19.080 --> 51:21.080
I know this isn't a piece

51:21.080 --> 51:23.080
That looks terrible

51:23.080 --> 51:25.080
Get rid of that

51:25.080 --> 51:27.080
Oh my god

51:27.080 --> 51:29.080
What am I doing with my life

51:29.080 --> 51:31.080
I was trying to talk about lactation

51:31.080 --> 51:33.080
Duh

51:35.080 --> 51:37.080
This was right before she said

51:37.080 --> 51:39.080
Chocolate that was correct

51:39.080 --> 51:41.080
Milk

51:41.080 --> 51:43.080
Milk

51:49.080 --> 51:51.080
Someone's getting a phone call

51:51.080 --> 51:53.080
Someone's getting a phone call

52:01.080 --> 52:03.080
I thought you were drawing a cute bunny face

52:03.080 --> 52:05.080
Nah they have some titties mate

52:07.080 --> 52:09.080
Thought I can see

52:09.080 --> 52:11.080
I have saved

52:11.080 --> 52:13.080
I have single handedly saved the stream

52:13.080 --> 52:15.080
Probably

52:15.080 --> 52:17.080
This is supposed to be it

52:17.080 --> 52:19.080
The liquid

52:19.080 --> 52:21.080
The liquid

52:21.080 --> 52:23.080
That's cheating

52:23.080 --> 52:25.080
That's cheating

52:25.080 --> 52:27.080
I know what I wanted to draw

52:27.080 --> 52:29.080
That's nothing

52:29.080 --> 52:31.080
Fine

52:31.080 --> 52:33.080
I don't even know what to draw for my own drawing

52:33.080 --> 52:35.080
Fine

52:35.080 --> 52:37.080
I started it and I'm gonna finish it

52:37.080 --> 52:39.080
It's me

52:39.080 --> 52:41.080
Fucking mental

52:47.080 --> 52:49.080
I don't know

52:49.080 --> 52:51.080
I'm already pooped from this

52:59.080 --> 53:01.080
It's the old Mac

53:01.080 --> 53:03.080
Okay

53:03.080 --> 53:05.080
Okay

53:05.080 --> 53:07.080
Okay

53:07.080 --> 53:09.080
I would talk

53:09.080 --> 53:11.080
But it takes so much brain power

53:11.080 --> 53:13.080
To do this and talk

53:13.080 --> 53:15.080
Talk

53:15.080 --> 53:17.080
Kiss your little

53:29.080 --> 53:31.080
My cats are fighting

53:31.080 --> 53:33.080
Stop

53:39.080 --> 53:41.080
This is a net

53:43.080 --> 53:45.080
Ah

53:45.080 --> 53:47.080
I don't know what I'm doing

53:47.080 --> 53:49.080
Yeah

53:51.080 --> 53:53.080
That's a pretty good net

53:57.080 --> 53:59.080
I think I need to grab it

54:09.080 --> 54:11.080
How do you spell squelch

54:11.080 --> 54:13.080
Squelch

54:13.080 --> 54:15.080
Squelch

54:15.080 --> 54:17.080
Yeah

54:17.080 --> 54:19.080
Yeah I am

54:19.080 --> 54:21.080
Is it the Amazon?

54:21.080 --> 54:23.080
Oh my god

54:23.080 --> 54:25.080
Is it the reverse Amazon position

54:25.080 --> 54:27.080
And the girls looking

54:27.080 --> 54:29.080
What are you drawing?

54:29.080 --> 54:31.080
What are you talking about?

54:31.080 --> 54:33.080
Reverse Amazon

54:33.080 --> 54:35.080
Is it like eBay?

54:35.080 --> 54:37.080
Yeah

54:37.080 --> 54:39.080
That's definitely what she's talking about

54:39.080 --> 54:41.080
Can they break it?

54:45.080 --> 54:47.080
Oh my god

54:53.080 --> 54:55.080
Does anybody need to take a quick break

54:55.080 --> 54:57.080
Before

54:57.080 --> 54:59.080
I'm ready

55:01.080 --> 55:03.080
Let's do this

55:03.080 --> 55:05.080
That was yours

55:05.080 --> 55:07.080
Okay

55:07.080 --> 55:09.080
Okay

55:09.080 --> 55:11.080

It's the answer

55:35.080 --> 55:37.080
Oh that's so good

55:39.080 --> 55:41.080
What do you mean you're a bad artist

55:41.080 --> 55:43.080
That's a very good little bear

55:43.080 --> 55:45.080
That's beautiful

55:45.080 --> 55:47.080
He got a boner under the blanket

55:47.080 --> 55:49.080
And everything

56:01.080 --> 56:03.080
Aww

56:03.080 --> 56:05.080
Oh

Wait, no the eggs

I lied

I didn't save the screen at all

56:41.080 --> 56:43.080
If I don't see a snail

56:47.080 --> 56:49.080
Oh my god

Okay miss artist

01:04:55.080 --> 01:04:57.080

I'm literally

01:04:59.080 --> 01:05:01.080
It means like I'm just gonna draw myself casual

01:05:01.080 --> 01:05:03.080
And it comes out with like this fucking banger

01:05:03.080 --> 01:05:05.080
Of a commission it would probably cost like

01:05:05.080 --> 01:05:07.080
500 dollars to do

01:05:07.080 --> 01:05:09.080

01:05:17.080 --> 01:05:19.080
I wish I could

01:05:19.080 --> 01:05:21.080
I wish I had a finger

01:05:21.080 --> 01:05:23.080
Nerval talent

01:05:23.080 --> 01:05:25.080
Speaking of that someone sent me a fucking marshmallow

01:05:25.080 --> 01:05:27.080
They were like thank you for not tying down

01:05:27.080 --> 01:05:29.080
Your talents

01:05:29.080 --> 01:05:31.080
To the designs that you assigned them

01:05:31.080 --> 01:05:33.080
And they can be more themselves and I'm like

01:05:33.080 --> 01:05:35.080
Yeah well why would I do that

01:05:35.080 --> 01:05:37.080
I was like

01:05:37.080 --> 01:05:39.080
I don't know why I feel like it's such a basic

01:05:39.080 --> 01:05:41.080
Things what the fuck do I need to draw next

01:05:41.080 --> 01:05:43.080
A bleeding heart

01:05:43.080 --> 01:05:45.080
Yeah we're more

01:05:45.080 --> 01:05:47.080
So like building upon the characters

01:05:47.080 --> 01:05:49.080
Rather than

01:05:49.080 --> 01:05:51.080
Changing everything

01:05:51.080 --> 01:05:53.080
Cause in

01:05:53.080 --> 01:05:55.080
Someone rated the vtuber

01:05:55.080 --> 01:05:57.080
They were like the only thing that would have been it better

01:05:57.080 --> 01:05:59.080
Is if you let them design their models

01:05:59.080 --> 01:06:01.080
Like from the start I'm like

01:06:01.080 --> 01:06:03.080
Bro it took me a fucking year to get here

01:06:03.080 --> 01:06:05.080
Like oh my god give me a fucking

01:06:05.080 --> 01:06:07.080
I don't think so

01:06:07.080 --> 01:06:09.080
It's never ever to

01:06:09.080 --> 01:06:11.080
Draw and rake

01:06:11.080 --> 01:06:13.080
A vtuber model

01:06:13.080 --> 01:06:15.080
You can ask Amy

01:06:15.080 --> 01:06:17.080
She knows how to do it

01:06:17.080 --> 01:06:19.080
It's a lot of work

01:06:19.080 --> 01:06:21.080
Oh my god

01:06:23.080 --> 01:06:25.080
Yeah there's only a select few corpos

01:06:25.080 --> 01:06:27.080
That will let you do that

01:06:27.080 --> 01:06:29.080
Oh shit

01:06:29.080 --> 01:06:31.080
Man this is rough

01:06:31.080 --> 01:06:33.080
Usually ones that have like artists in house

01:06:33.080 --> 01:06:35.080
Yeah

01:06:35.080 --> 01:06:37.080
We just

01:06:37.080 --> 01:06:39.080
This is so bad

01:06:39.080 --> 01:06:41.080
Most companies

01:06:41.080 --> 01:06:43.080
If not all of them

01:06:43.080 --> 01:06:45.080
Say for you

01:06:45.080 --> 01:06:47.080
Will have pre

01:06:47.080 --> 01:06:49.080
Pre-made

01:06:49.080 --> 01:06:51.080
Pre-made

01:06:51.080 --> 01:06:53.080
So it's not actually standard for people to choose

01:06:53.080 --> 01:06:55.080
Yeah it's really not

01:06:55.080 --> 01:06:57.080
Yeah

01:06:57.080 --> 01:06:59.080
That's why it's usually like cast for the roles

01:06:59.080 --> 01:07:01.080
You have to fit the character

01:07:01.080 --> 01:07:03.080
To the thing more

01:07:03.080 --> 01:07:05.080
Oh

01:07:05.080 --> 01:07:07.080
It's magic

01:07:07.080 --> 01:07:09.080
Oh

01:07:09.080 --> 01:07:11.080
It's magic

01:07:11.080 --> 01:07:13.080
You know

01:07:17.080 --> 01:07:19.080
There

01:07:19.080 --> 01:07:21.080
What the fuck is that stuff

01:07:23.080 --> 01:07:25.080
It looks like an abomination

01:07:27.080 --> 01:07:29.080
Oh no

01:07:29.080 --> 01:07:31.080
Replicated

01:07:31.080 --> 01:07:33.080
What is this

01:07:35.080 --> 01:07:37.080
Fuck

01:07:39.080 --> 01:07:41.080
Why do you guys have average shit

01:07:41.080 --> 01:07:43.080
Okay

01:07:43.080 --> 01:07:45.080
Now we have to draw it

01:07:45.080 --> 01:07:47.080
Are we ready

01:07:47.080 --> 01:07:49.080
No

01:07:49.080 --> 01:07:51.080
I guess I have to be

01:07:51.080 --> 01:07:53.080
I just

01:07:53.080 --> 01:07:55.080
I have to be ready for it

01:07:55.080 --> 01:07:57.080
Even if I'm not

01:07:57.080 --> 01:07:59.080
It's okay

01:07:59.080 --> 01:08:01.080
Just draw it your way

01:08:01.080 --> 01:08:03.080
Yeah

01:08:03.080 --> 01:08:05.080
Very nice

01:08:05.080 --> 01:08:07.080
I've already forgot

01:08:07.080 --> 01:08:09.080
Which position everyone was in

01:08:11.080 --> 01:08:13.080
This is so bad

01:08:17.080 --> 01:08:19.080
Sorry

01:08:19.080 --> 01:08:21.080
I would talk more but this takes so much brain power

01:08:21.080 --> 01:08:23.080
To do this

01:08:23.080 --> 01:08:25.080
I'm so brain dead

01:08:25.080 --> 01:08:27.080
Like

01:08:27.080 --> 01:08:29.080
I'm reading chat

01:08:29.080 --> 01:08:31.080
I'm reading everything

01:08:31.080 --> 01:08:33.080
But I'm not responding

01:08:33.080 --> 01:08:35.080
I'm so sorry

01:08:35.080 --> 01:08:37.080
I can see everyone

01:08:37.080 --> 01:08:39.080
I'm just really in this

01:08:41.080 --> 01:08:43.080
I feel like I'm just

01:08:43.080 --> 01:08:45.080
Fucking losing it

01:08:47.080 --> 01:08:49.080
Oh my god

01:08:49.080 --> 01:08:51.080
I forgot

01:08:51.080 --> 01:08:53.080
There was a shorter time

01:08:53.080 --> 01:08:55.080
That's far too short

01:08:55.080 --> 01:08:57.080
This is why it's chaotic

01:08:57.080 --> 01:08:59.080
Why was the other one longer

01:08:59.080 --> 01:09:01.080
I don't remember what

01:09:01.080 --> 01:09:03.080
I didn't want to do that

01:09:09.080 --> 01:09:11.080
Oh my god

01:09:11.080 --> 01:09:13.080
What

01:09:13.080 --> 01:09:15.080
Did someone draw Shiba in jail

01:09:15.080 --> 01:09:17.080
Okay

01:09:17.080 --> 01:09:19.080
Okay

01:09:19.080 --> 01:09:21.080
I don't know what it was

01:09:21.080 --> 01:09:23.080
Okay

01:09:23.080 --> 01:09:25.080
Oh shit there's like no time

01:09:25.080 --> 01:09:27.080
Fuck the time

01:09:27.080 --> 01:09:29.080
We draw this as fast as we can

01:09:29.080 --> 01:09:31.080
Oh fuck

01:09:35.080 --> 01:09:37.080
No

01:09:37.080 --> 01:09:39.080
Not like this

01:09:39.080 --> 01:09:41.080
Shit shit shit

01:09:41.080 --> 01:09:43.080
Can't remember what it looked like

01:09:43.080 --> 01:09:45.080
Fuck

01:09:45.080 --> 01:09:47.080
Is there supposed to be someone in a pirate boat by the way

01:09:47.080 --> 01:09:49.080
Cause I don't think I saw it

01:09:49.080 --> 01:09:51.080
There's supposed to be a person in it

01:09:51.080 --> 01:09:53.080
There's already gone

01:09:53.080 --> 01:09:55.080
There's a person

01:09:55.080 --> 01:09:57.080
It's supposed to go really fast

01:09:57.080 --> 01:09:59.080
So it's

01:09:59.080 --> 01:10:01.080
Oh my god

01:10:01.080 --> 01:10:03.080
Okay

01:10:03.080 --> 01:10:05.080
That's easy enough

01:10:05.080 --> 01:10:07.080
That's easy enough

01:10:07.080 --> 01:10:09.080
Oh it's already have

01:10:13.080 --> 01:10:15.080
Gotta go fast

01:10:15.080 --> 01:10:17.080
Faster faster oh fuck

01:10:17.080 --> 01:10:19.080
Faster faster

01:10:19.080 --> 01:10:21.080
Faster

01:10:21.080 --> 01:10:23.080
Oh shit

01:10:23.080 --> 01:10:25.080
Oh my god I am so sorry

01:10:25.080 --> 01:10:27.080
Come on

01:10:41.080 --> 01:10:43.080
Oh no no

01:10:43.080 --> 01:10:45.080
Okay okay okay okay we can do this

01:10:45.080 --> 01:10:47.080
We can do this

01:10:47.080 --> 01:10:49.080
Okay okay okay okay

Let's go let's go let's go

01:10:51.080 --> 01:10:53.080
Don't panic don't panic

01:10:55.080 --> 01:10:57.080
The great part is that we are all panicking

01:10:59.080 --> 01:11:01.080
No no no no

01:11:01.080 --> 01:11:03.080
Please

01:11:03.080 --> 01:11:05.080
Give me more time

01:11:05.080 --> 01:11:07.080
What even is that

01:11:11.080 --> 01:11:13.080
Okay this is easy

01:11:13.080 --> 01:11:15.080
This is easy

01:11:15.080 --> 01:11:17.080
This has to be

01:11:17.080 --> 01:11:19.080
Easy

01:11:19.080 --> 01:11:21.080
Easy easy easy

01:11:21.080 --> 01:11:23.080
Let's fucking go

01:11:23.080 --> 01:11:25.080
Let's fucking go

01:11:25.080 --> 01:11:27.080
Man this looks like shit but oh wow

01:11:29.080 --> 01:11:31.080
Oh fuck

01:11:31.080 --> 01:11:33.080
I mean

01:11:33.080 --> 01:11:35.080
That's close enough

01:11:35.080 --> 01:11:37.080
Oh my god

01:11:37.080 --> 01:11:39.080
That's close enough

01:11:39.080 --> 01:11:41.080
That was rough

01:11:41.080 --> 01:11:43.080
Oh

01:11:43.080 --> 01:11:45.080
Oh my god

01:11:45.080 --> 01:11:47.080
Oh my god

01:11:47.080 --> 01:11:49.080
That's amazing

01:11:49.080 --> 01:11:51.080
I love this

01:11:51.080 --> 01:11:53.080
Oh my god

01:11:59.080 --> 01:12:01.080
How does her have all that time

01:12:03.080 --> 01:12:05.080
Okay

01:12:05.080 --> 01:12:07.080
I did not have any time for that

01:12:07.080 --> 01:12:09.080
Yeah I was like this is Mr. Mittens

01:12:09.080 --> 01:12:11.080
At least

01:12:11.080 --> 01:12:13.080
At least

01:12:13.080 --> 01:12:15.080
At least it stayed a cat

01:12:15.080 --> 01:12:17.080
At least it stayed a cat

01:12:19.080 --> 01:12:21.080
That did a little campfire

01:12:21.080 --> 01:12:23.080
With all of us together

01:12:23.080 --> 01:12:25.080
That's so fucking cute

01:12:25.080 --> 01:12:27.080
That was supposed to be

01:12:27.080 --> 01:12:29.080
That was supposed to be

01:12:29.080 --> 01:12:31.080
That was supposed to be

01:12:31.080 --> 01:12:33.080
We are doing a sacrifice

01:12:33.080 --> 01:12:35.080
We are doing a sacrifice

01:12:35.080 --> 01:12:37.080
Sacrifice

01:12:37.080 --> 01:12:39.080
The dog

01:12:43.080 --> 01:12:45.080
The dog

01:12:45.080 --> 01:12:47.080
Oh we are arguing about the fire

01:12:47.080 --> 01:12:49.080
The angry face

01:12:49.080 --> 01:12:51.080
I can't

01:12:53.080 --> 01:12:55.080
That's so good

01:12:55.080 --> 01:12:57.080
At the end of the day we are all just

01:12:59.080 --> 01:13:01.080
Okay this is good

01:13:01.080 --> 01:13:03.080
This stayed

01:13:03.080 --> 01:13:05.080
Yeah

01:13:13.080 --> 01:13:15.080
That's perfect circle

01:13:27.080 --> 01:13:29.080
That was a good easy game

01:13:29.080 --> 01:13:31.080
He's getting more and more depressed

01:13:31.080 --> 01:13:33.080
What is she doing

01:13:33.080 --> 01:13:35.080
She's not in jail

01:13:35.080 --> 01:13:37.080
She's at the cage

01:13:37.080 --> 01:13:39.080
I thought she was in jail

01:13:39.080 --> 01:13:41.080
Okay that looks like it

01:13:43.080 --> 01:13:45.080
She is under arrest

01:13:51.080 --> 01:13:53.080
I love this

01:13:53.080 --> 01:13:55.080
He's still got the hooves there

01:13:55.080 --> 01:13:57.080
Help

01:13:57.080 --> 01:13:59.080
That's fucking amazing

01:13:59.080 --> 01:14:01.080
She broke FGO by the end

01:14:01.080 --> 01:14:03.080
Honestly

01:14:03.080 --> 01:14:05.080
He broke it

01:14:05.080 --> 01:14:07.080
He's free

01:14:07.080 --> 01:14:09.080
Oh

01:14:09.080 --> 01:14:11.080
It's one piece

01:14:11.080 --> 01:14:13.080
I was like why the frick

01:14:13.080 --> 01:14:15.080

I was like was someone supposed to be in the boat

01:14:17.080 --> 01:14:19.080

01:14:45.080 --> 01:14:47.080
I fucking can't

01:14:47.080 --> 01:14:49.080
That looked like a fuller punch

01:14:49.080 --> 01:14:51.080
Oh

01:14:53.080 --> 01:14:55.080
She's shooting her piss

01:14:57.080 --> 01:14:59.080
Wait that's supposed to be me

01:14:59.080 --> 01:15:01.080

01:15:09.080 --> 01:15:11.080
The piss will revive him

01:15:11.080 --> 01:15:13.080
Oh

01:15:13.080 --> 01:15:15.080
The piss will revive him

01:15:19.080 --> 01:15:21.080
Oh my god

01:15:21.080 --> 01:15:23.080
That was so good

01:15:25.080 --> 01:15:27.080
That was so good

01:15:27.080 --> 01:15:29.080
One more

01:15:29.080 --> 01:15:31.080
Which one

01:15:33.080 --> 01:15:35.080
Give us one more

01:15:35.080 --> 01:15:37.080
One more

01:15:39.080 --> 01:15:41.080
What when have we not done

01:15:43.080 --> 01:15:45.080
I don't know

01:15:45.080 --> 01:15:47.080
All the actions are a mystery

01:15:47.080 --> 01:15:49.080
Drawing incidences are hitting during the game

01:15:49.080 --> 01:15:51.080
Secret

01:15:51.080 --> 01:15:53.080
Okay

01:15:53.080 --> 01:15:55.080
I've never done that one before

01:15:57.080 --> 01:15:59.080
We'll try it

01:15:59.080 --> 01:16:01.080
Last run boys

01:16:01.080 --> 01:16:03.080
Last run

01:16:05.080 --> 01:16:07.080
What I can't see what I'm writing

01:16:07.080 --> 01:16:09.080
Oh secret

01:16:09.080 --> 01:16:11.080
How am I supposed to know what I'm writing

01:16:11.080 --> 01:16:13.080
Wait what

01:16:13.080 --> 01:16:15.080
Huh

01:16:15.080 --> 01:16:17.080

01:16:17.080 --> 01:16:19.080
Oh no wait you run out of freaking words

01:16:19.080 --> 01:16:21.080
Oh bro

01:16:21.080 --> 01:16:23.080
I can't erase my sense

01:16:23.080 --> 01:16:25.080
I don't know

01:16:25.080 --> 01:16:27.080
What is this

01:16:33.080 --> 01:16:35.080
Oh my god

01:16:35.080 --> 01:16:37.080
What is this it disappears

01:16:37.080 --> 01:16:39.080
Oh we can't see what we're drawing

01:16:39.080 --> 01:16:41.080
What

01:16:41.080 --> 01:16:43.080
Okay we'll draw fast

01:16:43.080 --> 01:16:45.080
What the fuck

01:16:45.080 --> 01:16:47.080
Okay

01:16:47.080 --> 01:16:49.080
Hold on

01:16:49.080 --> 01:16:51.080
I don't know I think

01:16:51.080 --> 01:16:53.080
I'm gonna just guess

01:16:53.080 --> 01:16:55.080
Oh no

01:16:55.080 --> 01:16:57.080
What it is where it is

01:16:57.080 --> 01:16:59.080
Oh god

01:16:59.080 --> 01:17:01.080
What the fuck

01:17:01.080 --> 01:17:03.080
Oh no no

01:17:07.080 --> 01:17:09.080
I'm gonna try to draw

01:17:09.080 --> 01:17:11.080
Why is it so hard to draw with a bone

01:17:11.080 --> 01:17:13.080
Ah

01:17:13.080 --> 01:17:15.080
I need food

01:17:19.080 --> 01:17:21.080
These are the past ones

01:17:21.080 --> 01:17:23.080
Can I

01:17:23.080 --> 01:17:25.080
Can I go backwards does it work like that

01:17:25.080 --> 01:17:27.080
I didn't give you legs

01:17:27.080 --> 01:17:29.080
Oh sugar

01:17:33.080 --> 01:17:35.080
I think A.C. is somewhere there

01:17:35.080 --> 01:17:37.080
Get out

01:17:37.080 --> 01:17:39.080
This is

01:17:39.080 --> 01:17:41.080
I have no idea what I drew

01:17:45.080 --> 01:17:47.080
I can't know what those are

01:17:47.080 --> 01:17:49.080
What is this

01:17:49.080 --> 01:17:51.080
Okay

01:17:51.080 --> 01:17:53.080
Okay

01:17:57.080 --> 01:17:59.080
Okay I spelled that all wrong

01:17:59.080 --> 01:18:01.080
No

01:18:01.080 --> 01:18:03.080
I didn't finish

01:18:03.080 --> 01:18:05.080
What the fuck

01:18:05.080 --> 01:18:07.080
What

01:18:07.080 --> 01:18:09.080
What does that even mean

01:18:11.080 --> 01:18:13.080
What does that even mean

01:18:13.080 --> 01:18:15.080
What the fuck

01:18:15.080 --> 01:18:17.080
I was gonna say

01:18:17.080 --> 01:18:19.080
Okay

01:18:19.080 --> 01:18:21.080
Oh fuck

01:18:21.080 --> 01:18:23.080
Oh fuck

01:18:23.080 --> 01:18:25.080
I don't know what else to draw

01:18:25.080 --> 01:18:27.080
That's exactly what I drew

01:18:27.080 --> 01:18:29.080
I think

01:18:29.080 --> 01:18:31.080
This is a vine reference

01:18:31.080 --> 01:18:33.080
I don't know what the fuck I'm doing

01:18:33.080 --> 01:18:35.080
Oh fuck

01:18:35.080 --> 01:18:37.080
I locked in

01:18:37.080 --> 01:18:39.080
Did I give

01:18:39.080 --> 01:18:41.080
Wait did I give them bodies

01:18:41.080 --> 01:18:43.080
I don't think I gave them bodies

01:18:43.080 --> 01:18:45.080
Oh my god

01:18:45.080 --> 01:18:47.080
I don't know

01:18:47.080 --> 01:18:49.080
I'm taking a shot in the dark

01:18:49.080 --> 01:18:51.080
Where so you know

01:18:51.080 --> 01:18:53.080
What that is gonna be interpreted as

01:18:53.080 --> 01:18:55.080
And will I stop the creative flow

01:18:55.080 --> 01:18:57.080
Do you

01:18:57.080 --> 01:18:59.080
Stop

01:18:59.080 --> 01:19:01.080
No Amy's got a hoodie here

01:19:01.080 --> 01:19:03.080
Oh sugar

01:19:03.080 --> 01:19:05.080
I put juice on her

01:19:09.080 --> 01:19:11.080
What the fuck

01:19:11.080 --> 01:19:13.080
I don't even know

01:19:13.080 --> 01:19:15.080
What the fuck I'm doing anymore

01:19:15.080 --> 01:19:17.080
I'm fucking dying

01:19:17.080 --> 01:19:19.080
What is this

01:19:19.080 --> 01:19:21.080
What is this

01:19:21.080 --> 01:19:23.080
Two feet of

01:19:23.080 --> 01:19:25.080
What

01:19:25.080 --> 01:19:27.080
What is happening

01:19:27.080 --> 01:19:29.080
What is this

01:19:29.080 --> 01:19:31.080
Someone had a stroke

01:19:31.080 --> 01:19:33.080
I hope you're feeling okay

01:19:33.080 --> 01:19:35.080
Make sure you hydrate

01:19:35.080 --> 01:19:37.080
Fuck I didn't have enough time

01:19:37.080 --> 01:19:39.080
To write it

01:19:39.080 --> 01:19:41.080
Oh man how do I even draw this

01:19:41.080 --> 01:19:43.080
This is

01:19:47.080 --> 01:19:49.080
That's the tongue

01:19:49.080 --> 01:19:51.080
And then this is

01:19:51.080 --> 01:19:53.080
Literally everything

01:19:53.080 --> 01:19:55.080
Wait

01:19:59.080 --> 01:20:01.080
This is so difficult

01:20:01.080 --> 01:20:03.080
Fuck am I drawing

01:20:11.080 --> 01:20:13.080
You need like motion swipes as well

01:20:13.080 --> 01:20:15.080
And a little arrow to indicate

01:20:15.080 --> 01:20:17.080
Yeah

01:20:17.080 --> 01:20:19.080
I don't know what I'm doing

01:20:19.080 --> 01:20:21.080
Yeah there we go

01:20:21.080 --> 01:20:23.080
I think I drew it correctly

01:20:23.080 --> 01:20:25.080
A little bit of lipstick

01:20:25.080 --> 01:20:27.080
Cute

01:20:27.080 --> 01:20:29.080
I don't know

01:20:29.080 --> 01:20:31.080
I just drew anything

01:20:31.080 --> 01:20:33.080
I don't know what I'm doing

01:20:35.080 --> 01:20:37.080
I can't wait to see

01:20:37.080 --> 01:20:39.080
The end of this

01:20:39.080 --> 01:20:41.080
Yeah this is going to be

01:20:41.080 --> 01:20:43.080
Something else

01:20:43.080 --> 01:20:45.080
This is going to be fucking insane

01:20:45.080 --> 01:20:47.080
What's going on in the ceiling

01:20:47.080 --> 01:20:49.080
Oh I need to draw it on the ceiling quick

01:20:49.080 --> 01:20:51.080
Oh I think I just got that

01:20:51.080 --> 01:20:53.080
Oh god oh boy

01:20:53.080 --> 01:20:55.080
I'm so scared of what these look like

01:20:55.080 --> 01:20:57.080
Same

01:20:57.080 --> 01:20:59.080
Oh my god

01:20:59.080 --> 01:21:01.080
What the fuck

01:21:01.080 --> 01:21:03.080
It's the end of the TikTok

01:21:03.080 --> 01:21:05.080
TikTok

01:21:07.080 --> 01:21:09.080
Oh my god

01:21:11.080 --> 01:21:13.080
Oh you're talking

01:21:13.080 --> 01:21:15.080
I completely missed the bodies

01:21:15.080 --> 01:21:17.080
Oh my god

01:21:25.080 --> 01:21:27.080
I was going to write even being cooked

01:21:27.080 --> 01:21:29.080
I was like

01:21:29.080 --> 01:21:31.080
I looked like she was on a stick

01:21:31.080 --> 01:21:33.080
That's rotating

01:21:33.080 --> 01:21:35.080
Oh

01:21:35.080 --> 01:21:37.080
I feel so hot

01:21:37.080 --> 01:21:39.080
That's everything

01:21:39.080 --> 01:21:41.080
This girl is my child

01:21:41.080 --> 01:21:43.080
Oh that's why you were humming

01:21:43.080 --> 01:21:45.080
Indiana Jones

01:21:45.080 --> 01:21:47.080
I was like where did that come from

01:21:47.080 --> 01:21:49.080
I was trying to write

01:21:49.080 --> 01:21:51.080
Cowboy but I didn't

01:21:51.080 --> 01:21:53.080
Oh that's so adorable

01:21:53.080 --> 01:21:55.080
That's so adorable

01:21:55.080 --> 01:21:57.080
Oh it's Emmy

01:21:59.080 --> 01:22:01.080
Wait

01:22:01.080 --> 01:22:03.080
What is this

01:22:05.080 --> 01:22:07.080
Draw it in white

01:22:09.080 --> 01:22:11.080
Oh colors

01:22:13.080 --> 01:22:15.080
I used the color black

01:22:17.080 --> 01:22:19.080
And I used red as well

01:22:19.080 --> 01:22:21.080
And orange

01:22:21.080 --> 01:22:23.080
What

01:22:23.080 --> 01:22:25.080
What is this

01:22:25.080 --> 01:22:27.080
What the fuck

01:22:27.080 --> 01:22:29.080
No

01:22:29.080 --> 01:22:31.080
No cow

01:22:31.080 --> 01:22:33.080
I can't read

01:22:33.080 --> 01:22:35.080
This is beautiful

01:22:35.080 --> 01:22:37.080
No cow

01:22:37.080 --> 01:22:39.080
Hey

01:22:39.080 --> 01:22:41.080
I like this girl

01:22:43.080 --> 01:22:45.080
She's like

01:22:45.080 --> 01:22:47.080
Is that all

01:22:47.080 --> 01:22:49.080
Oh my god

01:22:49.080 --> 01:22:51.080
Oh

01:22:51.080 --> 01:22:53.080
I used the fucking eraser

01:22:53.080 --> 01:22:55.080
That's why you couldn't fucking see it

01:22:59.080 --> 01:23:01.080
How did we get back to boobs

01:23:01.080 --> 01:23:03.080
I don't know how you managed that

01:23:03.080 --> 01:23:05.080
Honestly

01:23:07.080 --> 01:23:09.080
Well

01:23:09.080 --> 01:23:11.080
That potato was really bad

01:23:11.080 --> 01:23:13.080
Aw

01:23:13.080 --> 01:23:15.080
Awesome

01:23:15.080 --> 01:23:17.080
You were number one

01:23:17.080 --> 01:23:19.080
Oh is that a 3D concert

01:23:19.080 --> 01:23:21.080
Pee Pee's not number one

01:23:21.080 --> 01:23:23.080
Oh my god

01:23:29.080 --> 01:23:31.080
Oh no

01:23:31.080 --> 01:23:33.080
I think it is short

01:23:41.080 --> 01:23:43.080
Oh my god

01:23:43.080 --> 01:23:45.080
That's amazing

01:23:45.080 --> 01:23:47.080
That's what we got there

01:23:51.080 --> 01:23:53.080
Your mom called me

01:23:55.080 --> 01:23:57.080
Oh no

01:23:57.080 --> 01:23:59.080
I forgot to give up

01:24:11.080 --> 01:24:13.080
Oh no

01:24:15.080 --> 01:24:17.080
You're so sick

01:24:17.080 --> 01:24:19.080
Oh no

01:24:19.080 --> 01:24:21.080
My cheeks hurt

01:24:21.080 --> 01:24:23.080
My cheeks hurt

01:24:23.080 --> 01:24:25.080
Same

01:24:25.080 --> 01:24:27.080
My jaw hurt

01:24:27.080 --> 01:24:29.080
Okay okay

01:24:31.080 --> 01:24:33.080
Glad we could

01:24:39.080 --> 01:24:41.080
No

01:24:45.080 --> 01:24:47.080
Shit

01:24:47.080 --> 01:24:49.080
I just went over by a train

01:24:49.080 --> 01:24:51.080
Oh my god

01:24:53.080 --> 01:24:55.080
Somebody download that one

01:24:55.080 --> 01:24:57.080
Oh my god

01:24:57.080 --> 01:24:59.080
That's fucking amazing

01:25:01.080 --> 01:25:03.080
That's so fucking funny

01:25:03.080 --> 01:25:05.080
I love this

01:25:05.080 --> 01:25:07.080
Glad I got permission

01:25:09.080 --> 01:25:11.080
Glad I got a train

01:25:11.080 --> 01:25:13.080
I know it's a premium car

01:25:13.080 --> 01:25:15.080
They got the premium pass

01:25:15.080 --> 01:25:17.080
AC at the convention

01:25:17.080 --> 01:25:19.080
They got the premium pass

01:25:19.080 --> 01:25:21.080
That trains me

01:25:23.080 --> 01:25:25.080
Tag yourself

01:25:25.080 --> 01:25:27.080
I'm the ropes

01:25:27.080 --> 01:25:29.080
Tying Amy to the tracks

01:25:29.080 --> 01:25:31.080
Oh my god

01:25:31.080 --> 01:25:33.080
I'm not gonna

01:25:33.080 --> 01:25:35.080
Endure the girls to anything more

01:25:35.080 --> 01:25:37.080
Cause our faces are ready to fall off

01:25:37.080 --> 01:25:39.080
After that

01:25:39.080 --> 01:25:41.080
Is anyone in the stream

01:25:41.080 --> 01:25:43.080
Is anyone in the stream

01:25:43.080 --> 01:25:45.080
Are you doing a stream right now?

01:25:45.080 --> 01:25:47.080
I need to pee really bad

01:25:47.080 --> 01:25:49.080
I'm gonna jump out of the call

01:25:49.080 --> 01:25:51.080
Of course you need to pee

01:25:51.080 --> 01:25:53.080
I'm gonna jump out of the call

01:25:53.080 --> 01:25:55.080
I'm announcing my new piss off

01:25:55.080 --> 01:25:57.080
I know

01:25:59.080 --> 01:26:01.080
I'm going to jump out of the call

01:26:01.080 --> 01:26:03.080
And do a little zatsu

01:26:03.080 --> 01:26:05.080
Then I'll redirect into Yuzuru

01:26:05.080 --> 01:26:07.080
I'm a balloon star though

01:26:07.080 --> 01:26:09.080
I might play

01:26:09.080 --> 01:26:11.080
Do you guys want me to

01:26:11.080 --> 01:26:13.080
I might play some call the lamb

01:26:13.080 --> 01:26:15.080
If someone does a pop up stream

01:26:15.080 --> 01:26:17.080
Just tell me

01:26:17.080 --> 01:26:19.080

01:26:19.080 --> 01:26:21.080
Thank you so so much all members and dolls

01:26:21.080 --> 01:26:23.080
For this hilarity that ensued

01:26:23.080 --> 01:26:25.080
After such a miserable start

01:26:25.080 --> 01:26:27.080
It's such a miserable start

01:26:27.080 --> 01:26:29.080
To power wash her

01:26:29.080 --> 01:26:31.080
Shack myself from laughing so hard

01:26:31.080 --> 01:26:33.080
We already know

01:26:33.080 --> 01:26:35.080
Asus panties are soaked

01:26:35.080 --> 01:26:37.080
So let's not

01:26:37.080 --> 01:26:39.080
And Emmy probably

01:26:39.080 --> 01:26:41.080
No

01:26:41.080 --> 01:26:43.080
No

01:26:43.080 --> 01:26:45.080
Alright let me sniff

01:26:45.080 --> 01:26:47.080
Let me sniff

01:26:47.080 --> 01:26:49.080
Don't do the sniff test

01:26:49.080 --> 01:26:51.080
Rather pungent my dear

01:26:51.080 --> 01:26:53.080
Wait for me to just come out

01:26:53.080 --> 01:26:55.080
You have to take a test

01:26:55.080 --> 01:26:57.080
She just disintegrated

01:26:57.080 --> 01:26:59.080
Oh my god

01:26:59.080 --> 01:27:01.080
Right I'm gonna jump out of the chat

01:27:01.080 --> 01:27:03.080
Thank you so much

01:27:03.080 --> 01:27:05.080
We'll be doing collabs next week

01:27:05.080 --> 01:27:07.080
With each other so look out for that

01:27:07.080 --> 01:27:09.080
And I'll jump out of chat

01:27:09.080 --> 01:27:11.080

01:27:21.080 --> 01:27:23.080
That was fucking chaos

01:27:23.080 --> 01:27:25.080
I don't know why there's two of me either

01:27:25.080 --> 01:27:27.080
Bruh

01:27:27.080 --> 01:27:29.080
I mean honestly too for the price of one

01:27:29.080 --> 01:27:31.080
Why is there two

01:27:31.080 --> 01:27:33.080
No that's just the one I actually use

01:27:33.080 --> 01:27:35.080
Why is there two of me

01:27:35.080 --> 01:27:37.080
I wonder if it's picking a game

01:27:37.080 --> 01:27:39.080
Did I even have a chatting screen

01:27:39.080 --> 01:27:41.080
Oh I do

01:27:41.080 --> 01:27:43.080
Thank god

01:27:43.080 --> 01:27:45.080
Did I even have this asset

01:27:45.080 --> 01:27:47.080
Oh that's a lot of chatting

01:27:47.080 --> 01:27:49.080
Oh my goodness

01:27:49.080 --> 01:27:51.080
Oh sorry

01:27:51.080 --> 01:27:53.080

01:27:53.080 --> 01:27:55.080
Is that okay if I can go for

01:27:55.080 --> 01:27:57.080
A pee

01:27:57.080 --> 01:27:59.080

I need to catch up on some

01:28:03.080 --> 01:28:05.080

01:28:05.080 --> 01:28:07.080
Oh my goodness

01:28:07.080 --> 01:28:09.080
That was so fun

01:28:09.080 --> 01:28:11.080
After the abysmal

01:28:11.080 --> 01:28:13.080
I kid you not

01:28:13.080 --> 01:28:15.080
The abysmal freaking star

01:28:15.080 --> 01:28:17.080

Are you squinting me right now

01:28:23.080 --> 01:28:25.080
How did you manage to end this insanity

01:28:25.080 --> 01:28:27.080
Bro

01:28:27.080 --> 01:28:29.080
We are not

01:28:29.080 --> 01:28:31.080
Beating the peeler allegations

01:28:31.080 --> 01:28:33.080
I do not want to start up the

01:28:35.080 --> 01:28:37.080

I'm already done with that

01:28:39.080 --> 01:28:41.080
Right I'm going to very quickly go for a tinkle

01:28:41.080 --> 01:28:43.080

uh hope to hear more golem ASMR uh probably on twitter I have quite a few good ear licking

01:35:52.280 --> 01:35:58.040
videos that'll go on twitter because youtube's terms of service is sadly updated or being stealth

01:35:58.040 --> 01:36:06.360
updated and something is going on with ear licking and breathing in particular I have a sniffing

01:36:07.560 --> 01:36:15.560
video coming out soon and it may or may not be limited uh something rather odd going on a

01:36:15.560 --> 01:36:20.920
youtube headquarters but they don't want to publicly say it because ASMR is a one of the most

01:36:21.000 --> 01:36:26.440
I think it's like they're in their top 10 searches so I'll be curious to see what uh transforms

01:36:26.440 --> 01:36:31.240
accent isn't too harsh it's buttery smooth I tolerate I can hear pops did you hear that pop

01:36:31.800 --> 01:36:36.040
is it garthik phone is that what that pop is oh it's garthik that's what it is

01:36:37.560 --> 01:36:44.920

01:36:44.920 --> 01:36:49.720
your heart let yeah I knew there was a pop I thought it was going freaking mental there I was like what's

01:36:49.720 --> 01:36:57.320
going on oh my god the girls recovered that so well thank goodness she be uh had played garthik

01:36:57.320 --> 01:37:03.960
phone before that's the first time I've ever played it that was so fun freaking icy seems to

01:37:03.960 --> 01:37:11.640
be our muse we were like drawing icy icy icy I wonder if it's because because she's so recognizable

01:37:11.640 --> 01:37:16.520
with the blue ears and short blue hair that just makes her like so easily recognizable

01:37:17.160 --> 01:37:21.800
and then that's why we kept drawing her over and over again og suns kept getting mentioned

01:37:23.080 --> 01:37:31.720
I did get a marshmallow from an og sun that was like thank god for thank you for giving me icy

01:37:33.000 --> 01:37:38.760
like I'm so happy and I'm like oh I told her about it and so whoever og sun sent me that I do

01:37:39.400 --> 01:37:46.840
I do relay messages to the girls um you know I told them I've been getting quite a few marshmallows

01:37:46.840 --> 01:37:53.320
recently of people thanking me for picking them and it's like no no no no no it's all their work

01:37:53.320 --> 01:37:59.640
it's their hard efforts it's their enthusiasm um and they applied do you know how many people

01:38:00.520 --> 01:38:06.360
lurked and didn't apply because they didn't want to be the first in gen one basically um

01:38:06.600 --> 01:38:12.040
um so yeah give up give up for the girls for doing it because they they were doing

01:38:12.040 --> 01:38:22.440

to be on pc that's my only thing um I do have big stream tomorrow I just have wee streams today

01:38:37.880 --> 01:38:42.680
the reason I have wee streams is because I'm trying to catch up mersey's done her monetization

01:38:42.680 --> 01:38:47.400
so she can now upload her meme ace oh well I'll upload it on her channel she can unlist it at

01:38:47.400 --> 01:39:02.920

01:39:02.920 --> 01:39:06.600
oh uh my streams yes I think I'm doing runescape tomorrow

01:39:08.920 --> 01:39:14.040

01:39:14.120 --> 01:39:19.480
uh freaking other v-tubers are calling me mommy too I'm like yeah damn my influence is spread just

01:39:19.480 --> 01:39:30.840
like my in the ASMR booth huh man in the ASMR booth uh stroney I am actually supposed to be blonde

01:39:30.840 --> 01:39:41.000
or I'm a ginger because I'm Scottish in me you'd be called a ginger because your your hair's orange

01:39:41.000 --> 01:39:47.480
so you're a ginger and to Scottish people but I don't think other nationalities like really say

01:39:47.480 --> 01:39:54.040
ginger you thought you were blonde you're supposed to be orange like a pumpkin emi you're a pumpkin

01:39:55.240 --> 01:40:03.160
you're my you're my little pumpkin emi but she is so blonde wait is she actually but my hair is

01:40:03.160 --> 01:40:11.320
blonde wait am I going crazy am I colorblind but emi's ginger that's not blonde you've got a little

01:40:11.320 --> 01:40:18.680
pumpkin hair I've shown you your concept though I mean I guess you could say like your hair is

01:40:18.680 --> 01:40:27.480
top of your head is quite blondish I'd say your ginger ginger people have red hair don't they

01:40:28.360 --> 01:40:34.200
gin that's what ginger people are ginger people have orange hair like you that's what ginger

01:40:34.200 --> 01:40:42.920
voice you're a ginger emi you're a ginger emi yeah you know maybe maybe this is like cultural

01:40:42.920 --> 01:40:47.320
different thing but you're ginger in the Scottish eyes it's kind of a strawberry blonde her hair

01:40:47.320 --> 01:40:52.120
strawberry blonde the way I see it I thought it was orange myself yeah red hair it really is just

01:40:52.120 --> 01:40:57.880
orange yeah I was gonna say you're not like dyed box dyed red hair I think I'm giving emi a complex

01:40:57.880 --> 01:41:06.440
over this oops because my hair's got more reddish tint to it um to differentiate me from you

01:41:06.440 --> 01:41:12.280
because obviously we we both didn't want ginger hair I've got like a watermelon let's say someone

coming out soon now that the girls are monetized or getting to be monetized right I'm gonna

01:45:11.880 --> 01:45:20.440

01:45:50.120 --> 01:45:58.200
subscribes or enjoys the content or whatever um the girls were getting ahead of me which I was

01:45:58.200 --> 01:46:06.760
really happy about because I really didn't want to be ahead of everyone um uh but it's freaking

01:46:06.760 --> 01:46:11.560
happened and I'm like oh go subscribe to my daughters everyone look in the description right now and

01:46:11.560 --> 01:46:17.960
go subscribe but she be just went live I will redirect into Azura because I've actually yet

01:46:17.960 --> 01:46:24.360
to redirect into Azura once um so I'm going to make sure I do that I'm just gonna check if there's

01:46:24.360 --> 01:46:31.400
any marshmallows um yeah just thank you so much for your patience again as I said for some reason

01:46:31.400 --> 01:46:37.000
power washer simulator does allow six people to conglomerate that's not the correct word

01:46:37.000 --> 01:46:43.080
to come together to con congregate into one server however the requirements are you have

01:46:43.080 --> 01:46:49.640
had to have completed the campaign mode so I was the only one that had done that so I was trying to

01:46:49.640 --> 01:47:01.160
get everyone in at once it did not work um and we were like literally at the 20 minute mark and I

01:47:01.160 --> 01:47:05.720
was like oh my god we're just gonna have to cancel this and do like guerrilla streams and come back

01:47:05.720 --> 01:47:13.560
to this a later time but then she be she be kept me me head on me shoulders and um she said let's

01:47:13.560 --> 01:47:21.160
do garlic phone and we could do it because originally we were gonna do that other browser based

01:47:21.160 --> 01:47:27.960
one which I can't remember the name of oh but it was like we would have to screen record the discord

01:47:27.960 --> 01:47:33.800
and like absolutely fucking not with the absolute shit we take jackbox that's it we would have had to

01:47:33.800 --> 01:47:40.840
screen record at that I'm like don't don't even think about sharing that discord the amount of

01:47:40.840 --> 01:47:51.800
inappropriate stuff we send to one another do not dare even hover over displaying discord

01:47:52.920 --> 01:47:59.240
strani you can stream anything and we'd love every second of it thank you I'm glad I'm glad you agree

01:47:59.240 --> 01:48:05.320
we're doing uh I think we're doing endurance uh runescape tomorrow I want to try and get level

01:48:05.320 --> 01:48:14.040
70 cooking um we're not gonna do movies tomorrow I was actually gonna do marshmallows tomorrow

01:48:14.040 --> 01:48:19.240
whilst we stream for a bit and then do the classic I'll start rambling about anything and everything

01:48:19.240 --> 01:48:24.200
and then how we should be able to take over the capitalistic society and hopefully capitalism

01:48:24.200 --> 01:48:30.680
eats itself and births a much more yeah you know what I'm saying um I will do that tomorrow so my

01:48:30.680 --> 01:48:36.920
voice is gonna be fried my voice is actually fried from the ASMR yesterday um when I was like

01:48:36.920 --> 01:48:41.960
roleplaying as AC I don't think AC knows that I was roleplaying as her because she didn't mention

01:48:41.960 --> 01:48:48.520
anything of it but I was like like all of that like she didn't none of them knew I roleplayed

01:48:48.520 --> 01:48:53.160
and I'm like yeah I should probably stay under the radar because they're like why do you think I sound

01:48:53.160 --> 01:48:59.400
like that or something like that the revolution honestly need to see the discord chat it's just

01:48:59.400 --> 01:49:05.000
inappropriate it's like I want artwork of me like this I want artwork of me like that oh I want to

01:49:05.000 --> 01:49:10.200
do this with the you know the bleeding hearts I want to do this with the pin pals and I'm like

01:49:10.200 --> 01:49:19.880
bruv it's pretty weird so much like break free reflin conspiracy stream tomorrow let's go not

01:49:19.880 --> 01:49:26.360
exactly but uh someone said they would actually like to do like a full stream so I would have to

01:49:26.360 --> 01:49:32.440
plan for it there's quite a few streams I want to do that require preparation time which sucks

01:49:32.440 --> 01:49:39.160
because I have hardly any time I do have a collaboration of the girls coming out soon

01:49:40.200 --> 01:49:47.560
one big audio which should hopefully boost everyone past 5k I was checking the statistics

01:49:47.560 --> 01:49:54.600
and I was like why is AC and Azura not paying out the same levels and it's not because of like

01:49:54.920 --> 01:50:03.560
this or that I looked at how badly YouTube was culling everyone it was going for AC's jugular

01:50:03.560 --> 01:50:10.200
and Azura's throat like seriously the culling was so harsh I got culled 700 subs one day and AC

01:50:10.200 --> 01:50:17.240
got 1500 subs culled on one day which explains why um like because the viewership between us

01:50:17.240 --> 01:50:26.600
all is pretty much the same reef anarchy oh I quite like that Rafa Rafa and I see yeah AC and

01:50:26.600 --> 01:50:33.800
Azura got hit hard the worst um when we were doing that culling but it's over now the culling has

01:50:33.800 --> 01:50:40.840
stopped praise uh the lord because that was just getting so rough honestly um

01:50:45.000 --> 01:50:54.760
uh it's really cute that you keep the bibutes to yourself why would I share that

01:50:55.720 --> 01:51:01.880
I like it strongy silver hand is absolutely genius you would love to play

01:51:03.080 --> 01:51:09.160
2077 I'm certain of it okay okay we'll definitely play it I'm like 99 percent sure

01:51:09.160 --> 01:51:14.200
Rebecca's gun is in that game as well somewhere I don't know where but Rebecca's gun is somewhere

01:51:14.200 --> 01:51:21.640
in that game snowberries are strong yeah college at world at war zombie mode was like that back in

01:51:21.640 --> 01:51:28.520
the day we're not getting culled anymore now that we have content out we're monetized yada yada

01:51:28.520 --> 01:51:35.800
yada we're not getting culled anymore so thank goodness for that um because that was getting

01:51:35.800 --> 01:51:40.760
pretty rough but tomorrow endurance stream with runescape the day after we're playing crash

01:51:40.760 --> 01:51:48.440
bandicoot warped um I'm pretty sure they remastered the game but I think that's eight hours long to

01:51:48.520 --> 01:51:54.600
complete it so that's a nice uh it's a longer stream not endurance I think endurance is 10 hours

01:51:54.600 --> 01:51:59.160
that's what I consider an endurance stream anything less than 10 hours and I'm like meh

01:52:00.040 --> 01:52:05.160
that wasn't really wasn't really uh feeling it the only thing the only thing I don't like about

01:52:05.160 --> 01:52:10.120
doing endurance streams is that I have to walk away to go tinkle or get a cup of tea or get some

01:52:10.120 --> 01:52:15.720
food like I wish I could somehow do it all in this room so I didn't have to go away and like

01:52:15.720 --> 01:52:23.400
me or whatever the icy train joked sladia and they were good um that disappearing game mode

01:52:23.400 --> 01:52:29.080
was so fun trying to guess like where to draw next did you like the premium passes around the

01:52:29.080 --> 01:52:35.640
og suns next I there I was getting bullied and he was bullying me for my scotch accent I can't I

01:52:35.640 --> 01:52:42.600
said a word I think it was og suns because of the way it said I was oh no it was a hegeo or whatever

01:52:42.600 --> 01:52:49.560
and she was like oh the way you're saying it I'm like surprise surprise I'm freaking scot but

01:52:49.560 --> 01:52:55.160
the girls are such fun like mercy was a while ago like when we kind of just first got started

01:52:55.160 --> 01:53:00.280
mercy was like am I allowed to make fun of your accent I'm like yes mercy I sound absolutely

01:53:00.280 --> 01:53:06.680
ridiculous I know I sound bizarre it's perfectly fine mercy you can make fun of me you you do not

01:53:06.680 --> 01:53:11.880
have to be scared that I'm gonna be like oh my god you said something that's it you're getting a

01:53:11.880 --> 01:53:20.840
stealth suspension or something I don't know Scotland whatever it's okay have fun listening

01:53:20.840 --> 01:53:26.360
to your accent and pronouncing stuff yeah you're like the way I see things differently yeah I'll

01:53:26.360 --> 01:53:37.000
bet you do surprise surprise what the fuck is that ASMR video going well that I uploaded

01:53:37.320 --> 01:53:42.840
I've just refreshed and I've gone up a hundred subscribers am I missing something

01:53:47.640 --> 01:53:51.720
is someone posted that ASMR video somewhere

01:53:54.120 --> 01:54:00.040
or is it just because it's like a complete meme so the way I've recorded that audio I

01:54:00.040 --> 01:54:03.800
don't know if you guys have seen that a girlfriend begs you to let her hold the ASMR

01:54:04.280 --> 01:54:11.320
and it probably sounds a bit different because I've purposely left in mistakes normally I like

01:54:11.320 --> 01:54:20.680
super edit everything as much as possible but why is it picked up so much traction it should

01:54:20.680 --> 01:54:29.320
have only got like 1k views you hit the algorithm the vid is close to 4k views you say 4k on my

01:54:29.320 --> 01:54:35.480
end it says it's 5.4k views wait hold on I'll screenshot and show you what I see

01:54:35.480 --> 01:54:38.840
okay I need to refresh the page so I can get the confetti

01:54:41.080 --> 01:54:46.920
whoa that is screen recording please do not screen record that's not nice

01:54:47.640 --> 01:54:49.640
um

01:54:52.760 --> 01:54:53.640
does that not save

01:54:59.080 --> 01:55:03.320
this is what I see so if you've never seen like the behind the scenes of a

01:55:03.320 --> 01:55:09.880
an ooo to the video type thing uh this if I can redo this really quickly

01:55:10.200 --> 01:55:17.240
did that not save it did uh this is what it looks like when you upload a video

01:55:19.560 --> 01:55:25.720
uh it literally says like oh in four hours you've ranked by like your viewers if you have a one

01:55:25.720 --> 01:55:32.840
out of ten you get like confetti um an impression click through rate percentage you get like

01:55:32.840 --> 01:55:38.920
duration of how long they listen so yeah don't mind if I do I've got quite a few comments to

01:55:38.920 --> 01:55:49.160
approve on it though I have them comments uh on approval as you can imagine because I knew

01:55:49.160 --> 01:55:59.960
I cannot have an an agency that was a bit uh disoriented no that's not right at all um a bit um

01:56:04.520 --> 01:56:08.520
on alternative side you know I knew the girls were gonna get harassment and stuff so everything

01:56:08.520 --> 01:56:13.640
for us it shows 3.90 that's very cute

01:56:16.200 --> 01:56:21.640
up next someone commented up next girlfriend begs you to let her put donuts on it honestly that's

01:56:21.640 --> 01:56:31.320
probably the sequel um that's probably the very valid sequel don't think my comment got approved

01:56:31.480 --> 01:56:34.120
yeah the comments are really bugged out

01:56:42.360 --> 01:56:45.800
yeah the comments are like super bugged out for some reason when it comes to like needing to

01:56:45.800 --> 01:56:56.120
approve them oh my god I'm not used to seeing my my uh extremities I'm not used to seeing my my

01:56:56.120 --> 01:57:03.080
personality oh wait no that one wrong one sorry I'm not used to seeing my personality that's so

01:57:03.080 --> 01:57:16.760
weird um I just admire in the art for the art honestly um but yes that collab was fantastic

01:57:16.760 --> 01:57:21.720
um I did kind of do a little spoiler you know but next week the girls are doing one-on-one

01:57:21.720 --> 01:57:27.160
collabs do you want to know who I'm taking on have a guess who you think I'm collabing with next

01:57:27.160 --> 01:57:34.200
week from vealer from vealer take again have a gander

01:57:37.960 --> 01:57:43.560
me and mersey oh my cat's at the door um I don't know if you can hear it it's good

01:57:44.520 --> 01:57:50.120
um I'm playing with mersey and we're gonna be playing a game where we can go

01:57:52.520 --> 01:57:57.800
we're gonna be playing goose game together and I'm so excited I have no idea what it's gonna go

01:57:57.800 --> 01:58:05.720
like but I freaking love mersey um I was showing my co-worker while I'm watching brov me who just

01:58:05.800 --> 01:58:14.600
took off my you cat oh oh so that's what you're seeing is you picked mersey I should have picked

01:58:14.600 --> 01:58:24.920
any kind of door we ended up playing in goose game and honking out all the people I've never

01:58:24.920 --> 01:58:33.160
played goose game before but I think I think um it's like a puzzler timing type thing so hopefully

01:58:33.160 --> 01:58:37.400
I don't get too region as long as mersey can carry me hopefully she's played it before if she's not

01:58:37.400 --> 01:58:44.040
played it before then we'll be looking at the snippets and the reef links to help us up through the

01:58:44.040 --> 01:58:57.320
game um oh my god goose game yeah you split the first collab by size didn't you yes I did um that's

01:58:57.320 --> 01:59:03.240
also how the collab or alternative audios are split for the first time I don't know if people

01:59:03.240 --> 01:59:10.440
are gonna like isra and shabby's collab audio there will be some people who are like gonna

01:59:11.240 --> 01:59:16.040
levitate but I know it's not for the masses please don't be mad at them be mad at me because it's

01:59:16.040 --> 01:59:25.400
what I came up with and I quite like the idea um vealer and yumi plus um soon I can't really

01:59:25.400 --> 01:59:29.160
say when but soon um I don't know when we can say when

01:59:31.800 --> 01:59:38.440
it's good chaotic okay oh lord the old overwatch meme song is in psd well I was worried about name

01:59:38.440 --> 01:59:44.120
and mercy mercy because she had a uh I think I told you I did tell you guys um she was originally

01:59:44.120 --> 01:59:50.920
called karam beats uh in few all the way up to development about a month then I was like

01:59:51.000 --> 01:59:58.200
I need to rename her this isn't gonna work um I knew it was a bad name but there were so many

01:59:58.200 --> 02:00:05.800
developmental issues behind the scenes that kind of left me a bit helpless like I only had myself

02:00:05.800 --> 02:00:13.640
to rely on for certain sections and the naming kind of ended up with me um which I can like look back

02:00:13.640 --> 02:00:18.840
and laugh at now like that's why like I'm like oh fondle of bosom that's funny or like she be caught

02:00:18.840 --> 02:00:26.040
in bottom oh that's funny type thing but at the time like I could cry thinking about like the stress

02:00:26.040 --> 02:00:31.640
I was under and I felt like I couldn't like reach out to anyone in the development team side of things

02:00:31.640 --> 02:00:37.400
because I was having a really difficult time so karam beat made it all the way through until we

02:00:37.400 --> 02:00:43.800
got modest which means is frenched for your dressmaker and mercy if you didn't know her lore

02:00:43.800 --> 02:00:48.760
is she's actually a fashion designer which is why her outfit is so out there and is so unique

02:00:49.320 --> 02:00:56.360
um because it's handcrafted all that jazz um and um

02:00:59.400 --> 02:01:04.920
mercy obviously mercy is a very big overwatch character but there's no vtuber called mercy

02:01:04.920 --> 02:01:11.560
and I'm like mm mercy modest sounds so good and especially the yandere element of like the last

02:01:11.560 --> 02:01:17.400
thing you'll be screaming for is mercy I think I came up with that in the development team and

02:01:18.120 --> 02:01:23.480
like everyone just unanimously agreed there is another sentence we really like for mercy which is

02:01:24.040 --> 02:01:31.800
um fear is a top shelf aphrodisiac that came up by largely came up by one of the audio editors so

02:01:31.800 --> 02:01:38.280
shout out um to them they just came out with it and I was like yep we're gonna take that thank you

02:01:38.280 --> 02:01:43.640
and I think it's in her trailer um because it was such a good sentence uh you nailed the names in

02:01:43.640 --> 02:01:50.600
the end oh well I'm glad you agree thank god I'm not naming gen 2 or gen 3 um I don't have to do any

02:01:50.600 --> 02:01:58.120
of that gen 2 is getting named uh for me how many people are on the development team so they're not

02:01:58.120 --> 02:02:04.840
all listed on the website um I think uh we had a lot of comments like that they were like oh the

02:02:04.840 --> 02:02:10.600
the team's so small the team's so this the girls don't have access to the full development team for

02:02:10.600 --> 02:02:18.040
safety reasons and the development team do not have access to them um there's quite a lot of um

02:02:19.880 --> 02:02:28.600
advisors I guess is the best way to call them um and it's kind of just information fetching think

02:02:28.600 --> 02:02:34.600
of it like a fetch quest and uh like a video game just like here can you go tell this person this

02:02:34.600 --> 02:02:40.040
deliver this letter it's kind of like that um there's a lot of people who give influence in

02:02:40.040 --> 02:02:48.840
overall advice uh some of them are content creators some of them are long-term artists some of them

02:02:50.200 --> 02:02:57.400
um are editor the editors give a bit of feedback which is decent the audio editors they're

02:02:58.120 --> 02:03:05.880
um but yeah there there's a lot there's no um employees it's all contract based um

02:03:06.760 --> 02:03:10.280
and that was one of the feedbacks like oh the company's gonna go under because

02:03:10.280 --> 02:03:17.320
how are they gonna pay all these employees don't be so fucking stupid and that was that was probably

02:03:17.320 --> 02:03:24.520
one of my most used phrases when violor hadn't started up yet was that phrase whenever I read

02:03:24.520 --> 02:03:29.080
something it was like how are you how are you gonna pay all these salaries and all these

02:03:29.080 --> 02:03:38.120
medical expenses because you'll have to offer healthcare don't be so fucking stupid seriously

02:03:38.120 --> 02:03:47.400
don't be so daft in the head to to genuinely think that it's employee based when it is an

02:03:47.400 --> 02:03:52.680
international company dealing with international talents like none of us have fucking met in

02:03:52.680 --> 02:03:59.480
real life that's not how it works um like honestly some of the stuff it was like how

02:03:59.480 --> 02:04:09.560
are they gonna pay into their pensions don't be so fucking stupid it's obviously contract

02:04:09.560 --> 02:04:16.440
based work it's self employment contract based work like oh how are they gonna pay for all the

02:04:16.440 --> 02:04:25.320
editors uh when we go to them and commission the job like you think we have editors on on

02:04:25.320 --> 02:04:33.080
employee employee salary what so if they if I only give them three audios for an entire month

02:04:33.080 --> 02:04:43.880
I'm I'm still gonna give them a full salary don't be so fucking stupid honestly some of the

02:04:43.960 --> 02:04:50.520
feedback some of some of the feedback or that would be like the negative feedback do not even

02:04:50.520 --> 02:05:00.920
have a fraction of a clue on how to like run stuff and it's the confidence that like to even type

02:05:00.920 --> 02:05:10.520
such messages honestly unionize not like 401k benefit yeah like it's like it's an international

02:05:10.520 --> 02:05:18.040
company uh what do you mean you expect us to have private healthcare for our employees it's

02:05:18.040 --> 02:05:28.200
contract self employment based work oh my goodness oh my goodness like it's okay not to know about

02:05:28.200 --> 02:05:34.360
this stuff that's perfectly fine that's different but to wrongly announce and criticize the company

02:05:34.360 --> 02:05:41.480
before it had even launched and just to be so blatantly wrong oh it was my favorite

02:05:41.480 --> 02:05:47.240
phrase in development just just take a screenshot and like show the development team and be like

02:05:48.840 --> 02:05:56.200
oh some of this stuff was ridiculous um so it's been I have to admit it's been bloody satisfying

02:05:56.760 --> 02:06:02.680
it's been very satisfying being like yeah we're one weekend 5k subs oh yeah one weekend monetized

02:06:02.680 --> 02:06:07.880
oh yeah I have to admit that's been satisfying just to be like because everyone was like oh

02:06:10.120 --> 02:06:15.400
one of the biggest feedbacks actually was that uh the girls are gonna get harassed by the development

02:06:15.400 --> 02:06:23.320
team or something like that and I'm like don't be so stupid it's so easy not to give any developmental

02:06:23.320 --> 02:06:28.600
staff access to the talents and what to do I've done it and it's super easy turns out all you have

02:06:28.600 --> 02:06:34.680
to do is be an owl that's it you just have to relay messages to one team to another it's that easy

02:06:34.680 --> 02:06:43.320
like honestly some of the feedback was like oh then it'd be so stupid me anyway that's my rant

02:06:43.960 --> 02:06:49.240
over and done with thank you for living me to rant for one day what do you mean your

02:06:49.240 --> 02:06:54.200
Vtuber agency doesn't have a retirement plan oh literally it was like stuff like that like

02:06:54.200 --> 02:06:58.920
I can set the girls up long term and tell them what to do and like this is how I did it and this

02:06:58.920 --> 02:07:08.280
is how you should do it type thing um but yeah only one man can harass them exactly like um

02:07:10.200 --> 02:07:16.360
I spoke to like another agency owner and they were like oh everyone in their development team

02:07:16.360 --> 02:07:21.480
like had to go through um HR training as well as the talents and I was like

02:07:23.880 --> 02:07:29.800
I was who literally just like sexually harass each other and the discord and like send in

02:07:29.800 --> 02:07:33.640
the front like I was like straight up sending pictures of myself and I'm like this is what I

02:07:33.640 --> 02:07:42.760
literally like smile um so yeah the moment you called me a big girl literally I was like how

02:07:42.760 --> 02:07:45.880
that was really creepy I'm like why did those words slip past my mouth

02:07:47.320 --> 02:07:52.200
going to sleep right at rest well I'm gonna redirect into Azura very shortly um I'm

02:07:53.160 --> 02:07:59.880
I'm just yapping for a little bit a little recap um why would the dev team even want to

02:07:59.880 --> 02:08:07.240
well it happened in other high profile agencies let's just say um one agency in particular came

02:08:07.240 --> 02:08:14.280
out and were like her talent was uh had misconduct with a team member and I was like wait you mean

02:08:14.280 --> 02:08:19.720
your team member preyed upon your talent like the way they twisted that I was like oh that's

02:08:19.720 --> 02:08:23.880
our that's rough to try and navigate that one mate honestly just shut up and let them go

02:08:25.400 --> 02:08:30.360
uh stop apologizing that graphic collab is one of the best tunes I've had in five years

02:08:30.360 --> 02:08:36.280
awww strongy love ac love emmy love shebe love azura love velia via lura love but best of all

02:08:36.280 --> 02:08:43.400
mommy love free fling love uh hi strongy have you seen the kagaguri one six sale that's out

02:08:43.400 --> 02:08:50.360
for pre-order can you put it on throne oh that's very kind of you but I don't think I would get

02:08:50.360 --> 02:08:57.480
much use out of it I can't hot glue it unfortunately and I said what I said I want to hear strongy

02:08:57.480 --> 02:09:05.000
look at her there's also that popular streamer her editor admitted to jork into yeah that kind of stuff

02:09:05.000 --> 02:09:12.040
literally you know how you prevent all of that from happening in an agency have one person

02:09:12.040 --> 02:09:19.560
be an owl that's it have one person relay back and forth from the talents to the development team

02:09:19.560 --> 02:09:24.440
and that's it that's all you have to do it's super simple and easy but no one seemed to have

02:09:24.440 --> 02:09:30.200
figured it out before me so I actually feel pretty proud of myself for just knowing off the bat how

02:09:30.200 --> 02:09:38.920
to do that uh huh whenever something bad ish happens you should post a white paper note

02:09:38.920 --> 02:09:43.720
some vealers official twitter the tweets wording should be ambiguous and the right on the paper

02:09:43.720 --> 02:09:48.600
should be formal looking but tiny so people can't make out what it says from the preview but then

02:09:48.600 --> 02:09:53.080
they open it full screen it says nobody's getting suspended and you forgive the girls for whatever

02:09:53.080 --> 02:10:03.240
she did bro the girls cannae do any wrong like I'm sorry but like I don't know like ooh they did

02:10:03.240 --> 02:10:10.840
a kink that's frowned upon ooh so bad ooh like oh go and just let them play video games and shut

02:10:10.840 --> 02:10:20.440
the fuck up honestly anyway um something else to call that is a singular point failure a singular

02:10:20.440 --> 02:10:32.360
point of failure just one okay um but they did know how to be an owl but they were too lazy to do that

02:10:33.560 --> 02:10:42.840
uh it it it deboggles my mind um how there's not owls in other agencies all you need is a really

02:10:42.840 --> 02:10:49.400
basic owl did you know that in magic the gathering there was a creature type called cephalid referring

02:10:49.480 --> 02:10:56.440
to humanoid cephalopods I mentioned this because of the because tomorrow on June 14th wizards of the

02:10:56.440 --> 02:11:01.720
coasters officially removing them from the game albeit without a public announcement only through

02:11:01.720 --> 02:11:06.840
you know funny you mentioned magic the gathering I wanted to get into that when um

02:11:08.760 --> 02:11:12.280
I'm no longer busy but I'm not allowed to say it

02:11:12.760 --> 02:11:19.640
but they complained about sheebie to whom huh

02:11:23.160 --> 02:11:28.280
oh no it's something I don't like better light the beacons honestly it's like

02:11:28.280 --> 02:11:34.600
why don't you shut up like I feel like we're all just like on the same page where it's like

02:11:34.600 --> 02:11:40.600
just shut up and walk away if you don't enjoy the content it's really no that hard

02:11:41.880 --> 02:11:47.880
like I will continue to engage in the content that makes me upset and outraged and then you wonder

02:11:47.880 --> 02:11:53.720
why like you've got anxiety you've got depression you've got a fucking array of a list and then you

02:11:53.720 --> 02:11:57.800
keep participating in the shit that puts your body into fight or flight because you feel so

02:11:57.800 --> 02:12:11.320
passionate about the thing that upsets you like brav just fuck off and see what who what a message is

02:12:11.320 --> 02:12:26.040
this and I enjoyed your girlfriend begs you to let it hold it is the mom oh

02:12:28.760 --> 02:12:36.920
is someone who's writing poetry and my freaking marshmallow my hygiene is better than a frenchie

02:12:44.360 --> 02:12:47.880
is the one manager enough for six talents

02:12:49.320 --> 02:12:55.800
well let me reverse the question if you have an agency where the girls do not need to come to you

02:12:55.800 --> 02:13:00.200
for approval for streams approval on what they need to do approval for this approval for that

02:13:00.840 --> 02:13:08.600
what do you need to manage is my question the only thing was audios was my job but it's no longer

02:13:08.600 --> 02:13:15.160
my job because I have an audio manager in place so I don't even have to do that now so my question is

02:13:15.160 --> 02:13:20.360
what do the girls need help with because Azura's got her donut on coming up so I'm gonna work with

02:13:20.520 --> 02:13:26.040
her one-on-one on that and it's like you don't need a full-time person to come in and manage you

02:13:26.040 --> 02:13:31.480
know I don't mean that in a mean way I don't mean to be like I just mean like like seriously if you

02:13:31.480 --> 02:13:37.800
are genuinely curious like if you run an agency where the girls need permission for you every single

02:13:37.800 --> 02:13:42.120
week when they submit their games to you or like what they want to do that week yeah of course you're

02:13:42.120 --> 02:13:47.000
going to need a manager because you've forced that you've forced the hand of needing a manager

02:13:47.000 --> 02:13:55.000
running your agency like that if you say you know what girls you are adults I'm going to treat you

02:13:55.000 --> 02:14:00.360
like an adult you can decide on whatever you want to do if you need advice you come to me I'll tell

02:14:00.360 --> 02:14:09.000
you what I did or what I think would work well for you and yeah it completely negates the need of a

02:14:09.800 --> 02:14:18.040
a general manager now if the girls ever came to me and said I cannot think for myself I don't

02:14:18.040 --> 02:14:25.800
I want to stream but I can't think that's when I would create schedules for them and notes about

02:14:25.800 --> 02:14:33.000
what game I've selected or what zatsu or what theme I can do that you know it's very hands-off the more

02:14:33.000 --> 02:14:37.720
controlling you are the more the more headache you're causing for everyone the talents become

02:14:37.800 --> 02:14:42.280
insecure in their choices if you're rejecting their schedules and

02:14:45.640 --> 02:14:51.480
management itself will start to feel burned out and tired because they're having to abide by these

02:14:51.480 --> 02:14:55.800
rules of saying like oh this girl isn't allowed to play this game because of this reason but that

02:14:55.800 --> 02:15:00.840
girl that girl's fine she's allowed to do that because of this reason no you're just causing

02:15:01.560 --> 02:15:08.600
headache and heartache for no reason these girls that have applied for your agency they

02:15:08.600 --> 02:15:15.800
have saw a vision they have saw success in your plan for you to turn around and not let them cook

02:15:15.800 --> 02:15:24.680
as the as the saying is is just ridiculous you're just causing upset among all the ranks like if

02:15:24.680 --> 02:15:29.560
the girl if the girls ever came to me and said look I'm struggling to pick games guess what I've

02:15:29.560 --> 02:15:34.440
already wrote them a guide with loads of listed out games and if that's not enough then guess what

02:15:34.440 --> 02:15:37.960
I'll work one on one with them and pick out their schedule and pick games out that I think are

02:15:37.960 --> 02:15:42.040
accessible to them or what they'll enjoy I'll do my research like it's really not that hard to

02:15:42.040 --> 02:15:52.440
enable your talents it's really not that hard um potentially tech upgrades yes so that's up to

02:15:52.440 --> 02:15:58.360
the girl with the 80 20 split so it's just just turning into agency stream again I'd like to I

02:15:58.360 --> 02:16:03.160
like talking about the behind the scenes though because I don't mind yes when it comes to technology

02:16:03.960 --> 02:16:11.000
so some agencies will take a percentage out of their earnings to put back into technology

02:16:11.000 --> 02:16:17.960
we have said to the girls look the split is 80 20 whatever you do with your 80 percent is up to you

02:16:18.600 --> 02:16:24.600
and you know if you choose not to upgrade your equipment if you're not satisfied with it

02:16:25.080 --> 02:16:31.160
honestly that's not on us you know that's not on us at that point um like I'll say it to their feet

02:16:31.160 --> 02:16:36.040
like they already know like the girls are all on the same page if you're getting an 80 split 100

02:16:36.040 --> 02:16:43.080
merch sales um and a few other things coming up um yeah if if their technology's bugging out or

02:16:43.080 --> 02:16:51.320
they need something new and they don't pay for it themselves look brov brov we did offer a streaming

02:16:51.320 --> 02:16:58.200
kit so if the girls needed like basic iPhones for track in or microphones or a pc in someone's case

02:16:58.760 --> 02:17:04.600
um yeah we did purchase it on their behalf type thing but yeah mommy is doing so great and good

02:17:04.600 --> 02:17:09.800
job as you can hear so glad she caps about all literally I don't know why like any of it should

02:17:09.800 --> 02:17:15.800
be a secret it's just like this is how the agencies run I'm sure no one is surprised um

02:17:16.200 --> 02:17:22.520
um I love listening to you talk about these things really love getting to see your passion

02:17:22.520 --> 02:17:30.360
um it's um like literally like I'm giggling away being like oh I've just turned the ic stream off um

02:17:36.280 --> 02:17:42.680
that's wrong but uh sorry there's a ic just added me on timing um

02:17:43.000 --> 02:17:48.920
um yeah no I honestly don't mind talking about it oh obviously development took a year and I've

02:17:48.920 --> 02:17:55.080
kind of said like one of the criticisms we got was that the girls weren't allowed to pick their designs

02:17:55.960 --> 02:18:02.120
it took a year for the models to get here it took a year for the concept or it took a year like

02:18:02.840 --> 02:18:09.080
brov in the nicest way I am very aware that idol in lets their talents pick designs and that I can

02:18:09.080 --> 02:18:16.360
hear Gimli meowing um pics or designs and all of that we do not have a development team like that

02:18:16.360 --> 02:18:22.920
I do not have six model artists and six model rigors on standby at this time at this schedule

02:18:22.920 --> 02:18:29.880
that's just not possible for me especially with the way the cut works like if if I were to even

02:18:29.880 --> 02:18:35.960
offer that the cut would not be 80 20 that's just not possible in such a budget we would have to pay

02:18:36.040 --> 02:18:43.240
special rate Gimli I'm almost finished do you want in the room right right you'll get in the room

02:18:43.800 --> 02:18:50.040
sorry let me let Gimli in Gimli in you come

02:18:51.720 --> 02:18:55.960
then don't be surprised when I'm talking to myself like a crazy person in the room okay

02:18:56.920 --> 02:19:03.400
and don't go in the cupboard right Gimli has pika where she chews plastic you want on my lap

02:19:03.480 --> 02:19:07.160
where are you you want on my lap or do you just want to be in the room

tism going off like spider said she's just like me for real for real or I can thank you for the 10

02:20:18.040 --> 02:20:26.360
um yeah like I honestly don't mind like uh some of the other feedback we got was like oh no males

02:20:26.360 --> 02:20:31.880
absolutely nothing's stopping you for opening up a male agency mate good fucking luck for that the

02:20:31.880 --> 02:20:37.720
only reason I can do chicks is because I have chick experience isn't isn't that crazy man blowing

02:20:37.720 --> 02:20:42.440
concept Gimli isn't it she's currently rubbing my chair right now it's absolute mind blowing

02:20:42.440 --> 02:20:48.840
concept where I can't manage guys because I've never made content as a guy my staggering beyond

02:20:48.840 --> 02:20:56.040
belief absolutely earth shattering information revealed yeah the only reason I can hire chicks

02:20:56.040 --> 02:21:00.920
is because I've got experiences of chick like my god what am I gonna say I did oh yeah just

02:21:00.920 --> 02:21:08.680
fucking I don't know what do what games the guys play that girls don't play um oh yeah go play

02:21:08.680 --> 02:21:14.120
Tarkov for eight hours like what am I supposed to do I don't I don't what do you want from me

02:21:14.120 --> 02:21:21.720
go make your own freaking VTuber agency then like go divided have fun just remember to plan

02:21:21.720 --> 02:21:25.480
like double the money whatever money you think it'll cost double it and then add some more because

02:21:25.480 --> 02:21:34.760
that's exactly what happened to me um wait strong is a girl oh my god she knows what we're doing no

02:21:35.640 --> 02:21:42.600
oh no Tarkov players and shambles I've never played Tarkov but I or like rust but I think

02:21:42.600 --> 02:21:49.240
those are very very guy games we'll make her own refling agency with men in black jackets

02:21:51.080 --> 02:21:57.640

02:21:57.640 --> 02:22:04.520
room are you okay so my cats are neutered but it looks like she's peeping and she when she

02:22:04.520 --> 02:22:10.120
shakes her tail and she just did it there because she thought I was getting up to feed her you've

02:22:10.120 --> 02:22:16.200
got dry nibbles down Gimli don't don't make the reeflings think I starve you they're gonna burst

02:22:16.200 --> 02:22:22.040
