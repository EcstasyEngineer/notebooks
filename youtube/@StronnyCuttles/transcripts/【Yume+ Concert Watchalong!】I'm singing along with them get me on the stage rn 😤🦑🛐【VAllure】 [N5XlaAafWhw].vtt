11:10.560 --> 11:18.320
thought at the concert let me get let me get two pen lights out i don't have different colors i only

11:18.320 --> 11:24.800
have blue i have so many questions for them that how long this took this is insane i know right

11:25.440 --> 11:32.400
they should just like take the the soundtracks here and just post them as song covers too

11:33.040 --> 11:36.320
honestly that's a smart idea they should i think they will do and that seems

11:37.280 --> 11:41.280
you think they will help so because it's really good they shouldn't just leave it here on the

11:41.280 --> 11:49.440

as zura is singing along wiggling my pen lights zura knows the words

12:04.000 --> 12:07.440

12:07.600 --> 12:10.960
damn

12:13.760 --> 12:15.440
as zura not beating the weave allegations

my question is are they doing a five-man song at the end i bet i hope they do yeah i'm getting

44:30.960 --> 44:37.440
i wonder if they'll do like an original song yeah that would be crazy some people we should

44:37.440 --> 44:40.800
do an original song yeah they're like why did veeler not do an original song oh i brought

44:40.800 --> 44:44.720
it stressful and i was trying to debut last thing i want to do is give them a custom song that

44:44.720 --> 44:49.040
like to try and do but if you guys want to like we should all have an original we should have an

44:49.040 --> 44:53.520
a group song that's an original okay i'll do the male part of the song because my voice can have

44:53.520 --> 45:03.760
that i'll do the rap part of the song i'll do the backup vocals that leaves azura and mercy

45:03.760 --> 45:09.440
and icy perfect we're good yeah they can carry us through the through the actual vocals exactly

45:10.560 --> 45:18.080
i'll just do the yeah oh adlibs oh he was adlib everything let's get it veeler

45:24.080 --> 45:29.200

46:03.920 --> 46:06.720

i'm ready oh it's a fireman oh let's fucking go let's go

47:02.240 --> 47:12.320
oh that's amazing what song is this original question mark is this a k-pop song is it k-pop

47:14.080 --> 47:23.280
yeah what song is this i'm wondering it makes sense that they picked like a k-pop group

47:23.280 --> 47:27.440
because they all have like girl singers of different parts it's a twice song it is a twice song

47:27.600 --> 47:31.600
i feel like i would recognize it if it was a

47:31.600 --> 47:39.760
twice song but i guess i'm a fake twice fan name this particular members grandmother's
