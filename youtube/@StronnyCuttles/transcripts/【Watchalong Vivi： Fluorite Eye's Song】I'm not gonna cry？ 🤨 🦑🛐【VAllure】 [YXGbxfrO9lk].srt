00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:58,780
yourself go in the bathroom reflow the fuck is everywhere it's in the carpet

39
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:04,900
all the carpet oh can I tell you a disgusting story about my family so

40
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:11,020
in my grandparents house there was a cutout circle in front of one of the

41
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:18,900
seats and we just assumed like that it meant and like my granddad had been

42
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:23,580
sitting and getting up off the seat and it wore the carpet down over time the

43
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:28,660
secret was my granddad went out on a bender slouched over the chair puked

44
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:34,620
and it was so embedded in the carpet that they cut out the hole in the carpet

45
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:39,540
that was the big mystery secret to why the carpet was so worn down at his seat

46
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:46,020
it was like the revelation in the cuttles family when that came out all of

47
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:51,100
us were in an absolute uproar we're like what do you mean you went out on a

48
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:56,820
bender what like we were like asking for details or locations why the popcrawls

49
00:04:56,820 --> 00:05:01,860
you did name them because we didn't think granddad went now and literally fuck

50
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:07,060
themselves up we're like we're like give us the details we all just assumed it

51
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:11,580
was cuz he sat in the seat so much like out getting up in the friction kit like

52
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:16,380
because of it how did the inspection go you want to know what a bloody fucking

53
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:21,900
was oh so I didn't even have to go offline you know what it was it was

54
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:28,220
the fencing the last tenant put up that look like I put up fencing on the

55
00:05:28,220 --> 00:05:34,500
weekend that look like I can what DIY even stands for no it was the fencing

56
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:40,300
that they put up I could fucking shag him I didn't have to go off stream last

57
00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:46,860
yesterday absolutely shag him because I was I literally said I was like as much

58
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:51,140
as I'm like a good neat max if someone's coming to fucking inspect the you know

59
00:05:51,140 --> 00:05:55,740
inspect my weirs I get all nice and clean I polish those knobs you know what

60
00:05:55,740 --> 00:06:03,900
I'm saying mmm mmm and oh my god Spidey thank you for the 50 bomb yesterday I

61
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:07,500
missed it or you did it when I was offline

62
00:06:07,580 --> 00:06:11,020
no you didn't when I was offline 14 hours ago thank you Spidey for the 50

63
00:06:11,020 --> 00:06:17,180
bomb and god the 21st was pretty well I got hammered I broke my foot and didn't

64
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:20,620
go the other feet not the feet there's somebody little intricate bones of the

65
00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:25,780
feet they took away mommy time for that literally because I was like I'm not

66
00:06:25,780 --> 00:06:30,660
being funny as much as a neat back fucking place was spotless fucking

67
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:35,860
exactly unless you want to unless they wanted to be like mmm sorry your piece

68
00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:41,500
of cat nibble was outside the ball on the floor oh fucking shoot me then no

69
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:44,780
it was the fence and outside that had nothing to do with me I was like no

70
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:49,100
your last tenants fucking had that that's not to do with me because I'll

71
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:53,780
actually said to them the reason I'm renting this place is because I have

72
00:06:53,780 --> 00:07:01,220
fucking kitty cats and that cute oh no I'm gonna puke I'm gonna puke if I

73
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:04,540
think about it too much anyway so the good news is Yumi collab has been

74
00:07:04,580 --> 00:07:09,220
recorded so that might actually be my next record next collab that comes out

75
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:14,140
because it's very simple to edit versus the Poseidon collab which should

76
00:07:14,140 --> 00:07:18,900
technically be the next one that comes out but I don't think it's gonna open

77
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:24,820
which means they didn't do a proper inspection when the previous tenants

78
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:30,420
left her yeah and they like claimed that they cleaned they got a professional

79
00:07:30,420 --> 00:07:37,380
cleaner in the house and everything and I was like did you fuck did you fuck so I

80
00:07:37,380 --> 00:07:43,140
argued against that but the thing is the landlord is nice to me like he's a

81
00:07:43,140 --> 00:07:47,260
Chinese man and he does think he a fuck what I do I was like oh can I do this can

82
00:07:47,260 --> 00:07:54,260
I do that and like I've got a recording that fucking takes up like so much space

83
00:07:54,260 --> 00:07:58,940
I was like I'm gonna put this up and all that and he's like yeah okay like he

84
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:02,700
has to text me because he can't speak English so he like takes everything and

85
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:08,300
his wife takes me as well she's adorable she's like hi hope you're well and I'm

86
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:16,660

She'll wrap the building up in tin foil pop it in the microwave and blow up to fuck

326
00:49:57,740 --> 00:50:24,740
This is such a good anime

327
00:50:24,740 --> 00:50:40,740

You're not going to like hold on to him or something

He mad he looked down everything I knew was wrong

338
00:52:22,740 --> 00:52:27,740
I can't believe it

339
00:52:27,740 --> 00:52:30,740
He's experiencing cognitive dissonance

340
00:52:30,740 --> 00:52:55,740
See

00:52:55,740 --> 00:53:05,740

No

344
00:54:37,740 --> 00:54:52,740
That's like it looks like the link thing when he talks about the future like when it goes upwards

345
00:54:52,740 --> 00:55:05,740
Do you think they're compensating for something

Sorry that you can't do that

450
01:06:18,740 --> 01:06:22,740
I cried once okay I'm sure I'll be fine for the rest

451
01:06:38,740 --> 01:06:40,740
Space Hotel

452
01:06:40,740 --> 01:06:42,740
Would you

453
01:06:43,740 --> 01:06:48,740
I was gonna say would you go into space without me who's scared to leave my house

454
01:06:48,740 --> 01:06:51,740
I'd have to be very doped up for space

455
01:06:57,740 --> 01:07:00,740
Are we about to do a space mission

456
01:07:00,740 --> 01:07:02,740
I

457
01:07:10,740 --> 01:07:13,740
I would not want to bet my life on space hotel real

458
01:07:16,740 --> 01:07:18,740
Would you get mush and sickness in space

459
01:07:18,740 --> 01:07:20,740
I'm not sure

460
01:07:31,740 --> 01:07:33,740
I

461
01:07:34,740 --> 01:07:42,740
Love her hair like that. Oh my god. Sorry, but here confirm for Jim to I love the little bot like button in the back bit

462
01:07:42,740 --> 01:07:44,740
bits coming out

463
01:07:52,740 --> 01:07:54,740
Oh

464
01:08:00,740 --> 01:08:02,740
Oh

465
01:08:22,740 --> 01:08:24,740
She's a noisemus

466
01:08:31,740 --> 01:08:33,740
I

467
01:08:33,740 --> 01:08:35,740
Don't trust her

468
01:08:42,740 --> 01:08:49,480
I don't trust her after that scene at the star. I think it's like long fucking blue a blonde hair

469
01:08:49,480 --> 01:08:51,480
I

470
01:08:54,600 --> 01:08:57,840
Soon as I soon as a management go one big family

471
01:08:59,840 --> 01:09:08,760
You know getting free overtime for me boss makes a dollar I'll make a day. That's why I shit on company time

472
01:09:20,480 --> 01:09:22,480
Hmm

473
01:09:24,600 --> 01:09:28,040
What's wrong with blonde hair the opening

474
01:09:31,880 --> 01:09:34,880
See that the opening scene I told you I told you

475
01:09:43,880 --> 01:09:47,360
Hmm defective

476
01:09:49,480 --> 01:09:51,480
I

477
01:09:51,480 --> 01:10:06,480
Oh, I should have been in a wee school, I don't know.

478
01:10:06,480 --> 01:10:24,480
Okay, I love these mission debriefs.

479
01:10:36,480 --> 01:10:52,480
I like that it's in a musical setting. These debriefs as well. Oh no, it's a brief, not debrief sort.

480
01:10:53,480 --> 01:10:59,480
Where's the stealer? Taking the piss?

481
01:11:03,480 --> 01:11:07,480
Yeah, it says pee at the end, like a pee pee.

482
01:11:52,480 --> 01:12:19,480
This is cute.

483
01:12:22,480 --> 01:12:28,480
She looks like another anime character.

484
01:12:52,480 --> 01:13:08,480
Revolker credentials? You've been denied.

485
01:13:08,480 --> 01:13:34,480
The inspection went fine, it was a misunderstanding, so I didn't even have to go offline. They were literally here for two things and then went away again and I'm like, yeah.

486
01:13:34,480 --> 01:13:44,480
What?

487
01:13:44,480 --> 01:14:00,480
Oh ya piss. Oh ya piss, she's gone rogue. She killed the master. Get Kludon, Lieutenant Colombo, where is it? And just one more thing.

488
01:14:00,480 --> 01:14:11,480
Actually, we should watch Lieutenant Colombo. Just for the hell of it. Just a few random episodes. And just one more thing.

489
01:14:11,480 --> 01:14:14,480
My mum loved watching Lieutenant Colombo.

490
01:14:14,480 --> 01:14:19,480
Are you still being mum? Why is his eye funny?

491
01:14:19,480 --> 01:14:29,480
Oh, he's joining. He's got a glass eye. Oh, I didn't know you could do that.

492
01:14:29,480 --> 01:14:53,480
Hey, you're not supposed to be oof.

493
01:15:23,480 --> 01:15:46,480
Oh, he's getting pampered.

494
01:15:46,480 --> 01:16:09,480
It's been about seven years already.

495
01:16:16,480 --> 01:16:43,480
He's got a glass eye.

496
01:16:43,480 --> 01:16:59,480
Let's see, fuck off.

497
01:16:59,480 --> 01:17:13,480
Maybe if I can't have it, no one can.

498
01:17:13,480 --> 01:17:18,480
They played with pocket knives?

499
01:17:18,480 --> 01:17:41,480
My idea of fun is, you know, beating up a game.

500
01:17:41,480 --> 01:17:54,480
Ouchie.

501
01:18:11,480 --> 01:18:28,480
Maybe she wasn't the bad guy all along.

502
01:18:28,480 --> 01:18:33,480
We got infiltrated. She's not the baddie.

503
01:18:33,480 --> 01:18:57,480
She destroyed something on the ship and had to sacrifice everyone and her way.

504
01:18:57,480 --> 01:19:10,480
I don't think she's the baddie.

505
01:19:10,480 --> 01:19:29,480
I think it'll be an infiltration mission for some information in the ship or intel.

506
01:19:29,480 --> 01:19:46,480
I could be wrong. I think she's not the baddie.

507
01:19:59,480 --> 01:20:28,480
I don't think she killed them.

508
01:20:28,480 --> 01:20:49,480
I don't think she killed them.

509
01:20:49,480 --> 01:21:13,480
I'm gonna pull it thickens.

510
01:21:13,480 --> 01:21:34,480
Oh, no.

511
01:21:34,480 --> 01:21:45,480
There's the pink beard.

512
01:21:45,480 --> 01:21:55,480
Who will get justice? I'll spoke over it.

513
01:21:55,480 --> 01:22:12,480
No, no, I'm confused. Is she the baddie or no?

514
01:22:12,480 --> 01:22:23,480
No, I don't want fucking spoilers for the next thing. Stop with the fucking spoiler anime. You need to fucking wrap it up with the body spoilers for the next episode in the last episode. That needs to be wrapped up.

515
01:22:23,480 --> 01:22:31,480
Stop fucking spoiling scenes. Am I mental? I just spoiled what's happening in the next year.

516
01:22:31,480 --> 01:22:34,480
Fuck off.

517
01:22:34,480 --> 01:22:38,480
The plot thickens just like my ass because I'm not doing any exercise.

518
01:22:38,480 --> 01:22:43,480
Right, are we ready to go again? I'm hooked.

519
01:22:43,480 --> 01:22:51,480
After this one, I'm gonna get some food and drink and hydrae and I'll take two of our breaks.

520
01:22:51,480 --> 01:22:53,480
Are you ready?

521
01:22:53,480 --> 01:22:56,480
Can anyone summarise what happened so far?

522
01:22:56,480 --> 01:23:02,480
Teddy bear from future help blue hair girl save future.

523
01:23:03,480 --> 01:23:07,480
What a fucking summary.

524
01:23:07,480 --> 01:23:12,480
I'll count down and then on go we hit it.

525
01:23:12,480 --> 01:23:20,480
Episode four. Three, two, one, go.

526
01:23:20,480 --> 01:23:24,480
I'm gonna have to leave. Have fun. Thank you for hanging me Flynn.

527
01:23:24,480 --> 01:23:29,480
Please don't worry if you can't hang for the full time. This is a long watch along.

528
01:23:29,480 --> 01:23:34,480
I'm sorry.

529
01:23:50,480 --> 01:23:52,480
Wait, he's older.

530
01:23:52,480 --> 01:23:59,480
Wait, that's- is that us?

531
01:23:59,480 --> 01:24:00,480
No.

532
01:24:00,480 --> 01:24:01,480
No.

533
01:24:01,480 --> 01:24:02,480
No.

534
01:24:02,480 --> 01:24:03,480
She's the body!

535
01:24:03,480 --> 01:24:04,480
Fuck it!

536
01:24:04,480 --> 01:24:05,480
She's the body!

537
01:24:05,480 --> 01:24:06,480
She's taking fucking the dead thing from the guy!

538
01:24:06,480 --> 01:24:07,480
Fuck!

539
01:24:07,480 --> 01:24:10,480
I keep getting switched and baited and baited and switched.

540
01:24:10,480 --> 01:24:11,480
Fucking unbaited.

541
01:24:11,480 --> 01:24:12,480
Fuck.

542
01:24:12,480 --> 01:24:13,480
Fuck.

543
01:24:13,480 --> 01:24:14,480
Fuck.

544
01:24:14,480 --> 01:24:15,480
Fuck.

545
01:24:15,480 --> 01:24:16,480
Fuck.

546
01:24:16,480 --> 01:24:17,480
Fuck.

547
01:24:17,480 --> 01:24:18,480
Fuck.

548
01:24:18,480 --> 01:24:19,480
Fuck.

549
01:24:19,480 --> 01:24:20,480
Fuck.

550
01:24:20,480 --> 01:24:21,480
Fuck.

551
01:24:21,480 --> 01:24:23,480
Fuck, you can un-bait yourself right now.

552
01:24:23,480 --> 01:24:24,480
I can't follow.

553
01:24:24,480 --> 01:24:26,480
I'm not smart enough to see through the plot.

554
01:24:26,480 --> 01:24:28,480
You know how people are like,

555
01:24:28,480 --> 01:24:29,480
Oh!

556
01:24:29,480 --> 01:24:31,480
I can see the plot ten miles away.

557
01:24:31,480 --> 01:24:32,480
I'm like,

558
01:24:32,480 --> 01:24:33,480
Uh,

559
01:24:33,480 --> 01:24:34,480
Uh,

560
01:24:34,480 --> 01:24:35,480
Uh,

561
01:24:35,480 --> 01:24:36,480
Uh,

562
01:24:36,480 --> 01:24:37,480
Uh,

563
01:24:37,480 --> 01:24:38,480
Uh,

564
01:24:38,480 --> 01:24:39,480
Uh,

565
01:24:39,480 --> 01:24:40,480
Uh,

566
01:24:40,480 --> 01:24:41,480
Uh,

567
01:24:41,480 --> 01:24:42,480
Uh,

568
01:24:42,480 --> 01:24:43,480
Uh,

569
01:24:43,480 --> 01:24:44,480
Uh,

570
01:24:44,480 --> 01:24:45,480
Uh,

571
01:24:45,480 --> 01:24:46,480
Uh,

572
01:24:46,480 --> 01:24:48,480
Uh,

573
01:24:48,480 --> 01:24:50,480
Uh,

574
01:24:50,480 --> 01:24:57,480
The plot is as thick as ink. The plot explains itself. The anime has me completely spun vested.

575
01:24:57,480 --> 01:25:03,480
Will Donate some brain cells? No, I need just to be able to hook into the same brain cells as me.

576
01:25:03,480 --> 01:25:08,480
The other anime is built different. Most of them are predictable.

577
01:25:08,480 --> 01:25:11,480
Is this just like the most bizarre one?

578
01:25:12,480 --> 01:25:15,480
Perfect low IQ, beloved.

579
01:25:15,480 --> 01:25:17,480
Honestly.

580
01:25:17,480 --> 01:25:19,480
Switch-sterbated.

581
01:25:29,480 --> 01:25:36,480
I don't think I've seen a scene in it so far that I'd want to get commissioned of us together as...

582
01:25:37,480 --> 01:25:42,480
Obviously the blackmail scene in the other anime.

583
01:25:44,480 --> 01:25:45,480
Oh my god.

584
01:25:45,480 --> 01:25:48,480
Wait, that's the sister?

585
01:26:03,480 --> 01:26:05,480
Oh no.

586
01:26:06,480 --> 01:26:08,480
Oh no.

587
01:26:18,480 --> 01:26:20,480
Uh...

588
01:26:32,480 --> 01:26:34,480
Uh...

589
01:26:36,480 --> 01:26:38,480
Oh no.

590
01:27:03,480 --> 01:27:05,480
Oh no.

591
01:27:07,480 --> 01:27:09,480
Oh no.

592
01:27:28,480 --> 01:27:31,480
So the band kept her from going rogue.

593
01:27:31,480 --> 01:27:34,480
Oh yeah, Pestas Titanium Steel!

594
01:27:36,480 --> 01:27:38,480
Uh...

595
01:27:48,480 --> 01:27:50,480
She was pranked!

596
01:27:50,480 --> 01:27:53,480
But the worst kind of prank!

597
01:27:57,480 --> 01:28:00,480
The imposter prank.

598
01:28:06,480 --> 01:28:09,480
He's going to recognize us though.

599
01:28:31,480 --> 01:28:33,480
Oh no.

600
01:28:37,480 --> 01:28:42,480
Identity theft is not a joke!

601
01:28:57,480 --> 01:28:59,480
Oh yes.

602
01:29:06,480 --> 01:29:08,480
Oh no.

603
01:29:23,480 --> 01:29:25,480
Bruh.

604
01:29:25,480 --> 01:29:27,480
I'm not crying, okay?

605
01:29:27,480 --> 01:29:40,480
No! Don't give us the fucking flashbacks! Come on!

606
01:29:40,480 --> 01:29:42,480
Oh no.

607
01:29:55,480 --> 01:29:58,480
Oh my god, it's the teddy bear her sister gave.

608
01:29:58,480 --> 01:30:00,480
Bruh.

609
01:30:10,480 --> 01:30:12,480
Bruh.

610
01:30:30,480 --> 01:30:33,480
I'm not crying, I just have tears in my eyes.

611
01:30:33,480 --> 01:30:36,480
But they're not dropping so it doesn't count.

612
01:30:40,480 --> 01:30:42,480
Okay.

613
01:30:56,480 --> 01:30:58,480
It's time.

614
01:31:10,480 --> 01:31:12,480
No.

615
01:31:26,480 --> 01:31:29,480
Room service about to bust the mess.

616
01:31:35,480 --> 01:31:39,480
Why did her fucking lips change? Why is she gone?

617
01:31:40,480 --> 01:31:43,480
Why does she randomly have a glow up?

618
01:31:43,480 --> 01:31:46,480
She got a bit of like fucking blush on her cheek,

619
01:31:46,480 --> 01:31:49,480
a bit highlighter, a bit of contour, what was that?

620
01:31:49,480 --> 01:31:53,480
I love when anime randomly does stuff like that.

621
01:31:54,480 --> 01:31:57,480
Okay, we're not looking at any post credit scenes by the way

622
01:31:57,480 --> 01:32:00,480
because this literally got spoiled in the last one.

623
01:32:02,480 --> 01:32:04,480
The buff went crazy.

624
01:32:10,480 --> 01:32:12,480
Is she okay?

625
01:32:19,480 --> 01:32:21,480
Do you know the muffin man?

626
01:32:21,480 --> 01:32:23,480
Sorry.

627
01:32:26,480 --> 01:32:28,480
It's just the way she said it.

628
01:32:35,480 --> 01:32:37,480
Surprise!

629
01:32:39,480 --> 01:32:41,480
Surprise!

630
01:32:54,480 --> 01:32:56,480
Let's see.

631
01:33:09,480 --> 01:33:11,480
Hmm.

632
01:33:22,480 --> 01:33:24,480
Oh.

633
01:33:39,480 --> 01:33:41,480
Oh.

634
01:34:05,480 --> 01:34:07,480
What the fuck they did? Oh.

635
01:34:09,480 --> 01:34:11,480
Oh.

636
01:34:39,480 --> 01:34:41,480
Oh.

637
01:34:43,480 --> 01:34:45,480
Oh.

638
01:34:53,480 --> 01:34:55,480
Okay.

639
01:34:55,480 --> 01:34:57,480
Okay.

640
01:35:10,480 --> 01:35:12,480
Sorry, that's not nice.

641
01:35:12,480 --> 01:35:14,480
I don't mean that in an S3.

642
01:35:14,480 --> 01:35:16,480
It's just because all the voices in this anime are high pitched

643
01:35:16,480 --> 01:35:20,480
all the way up here and then this is the first voice that we have down here.

644
01:35:21,480 --> 01:35:24,480
The bird tried to escape and it perished.

645
01:35:38,480 --> 01:35:41,480
They literally went on a suicide mission.

646
01:35:50,480 --> 01:35:52,480
Oh.

647
01:36:05,480 --> 01:36:07,480
He remembers.

648
01:36:21,480 --> 01:36:24,480
He got them cowboy beat-bop eyes.

649
01:36:40,480 --> 01:36:42,480
She has her own agendination?

650
01:36:50,480 --> 01:36:54,480
She wants to just keep them alive?

651
01:37:20,480 --> 01:37:22,480
I don't know.

652
01:37:51,480 --> 01:37:53,480
Oh.

653
01:37:57,480 --> 01:37:59,480
Holy shit, the budget went into this.

654
01:37:59,480 --> 01:38:01,480
What the fuck?

655
01:38:21,480 --> 01:38:23,480
Can she fate? She can he fate it.

656
01:38:23,480 --> 01:38:26,480
He's like 100 years in the future with EI.

657
01:38:27,480 --> 01:38:29,480
She only wanted to serve?

658
01:38:48,480 --> 01:38:50,480
She only wanted to serve?

659
01:38:56,480 --> 01:38:58,480
Holy shit.

660
01:39:04,480 --> 01:39:06,480
Holy shit.

661
01:39:27,480 --> 01:39:29,480
No, no, no, no, no.

662
01:39:29,480 --> 01:39:31,480
Not the bracelet.

663
01:39:31,480 --> 01:39:33,480
Not the bracelet.

664
01:39:34,480 --> 01:39:36,480
Teddy bear, can you like fucking throw that?

665
01:39:40,480 --> 01:39:42,480
Does she implant a virus?

666
01:39:42,480 --> 01:39:46,480
Oh, oh god, the symbolism is actually quite the fucking contrast.

667
01:39:56,480 --> 01:39:59,480
Goddamn.

668
01:40:26,480 --> 01:40:28,480
I feel like I just went insane.

669
01:40:28,480 --> 01:40:32,480
I'm getting a sense for it ourselves.

670
01:40:44,480 --> 01:40:51,480
Hello story repeats itself.

671
01:40:51,480 --> 01:40:53,480
Hello story repeats itself.

672
01:40:53,480 --> 01:41:22,480
She does crash, but she crashes the scene.

673
01:41:22,480 --> 01:41:49,480
At least the passengers are safe, holy fuck.

674
01:41:49,480 --> 01:42:09,480
No!

675
01:42:09,480 --> 01:42:12,480
The hair was intertwined in her bracelet.

676
01:42:19,480 --> 01:42:42,480
She forgot the virus erased.

677
01:42:42,480 --> 01:43:05,480
Can we watch anime that don't make me cry every 2 seconds? What the fuck?

678
01:43:06,480 --> 01:43:17,480
Do you faint? Can we pick ones that are like funny ha ha? I can't even be watching this stuff.

679
01:43:17,480 --> 01:43:30,480
Do you faint? Can we watch Sun Funny? I'm snot coming out my nose.

680
01:43:30,480 --> 01:43:40,480
You picked this? Did I look like a fuck?

681
01:43:40,480 --> 01:43:47,480
No way! I'm trying to be nice.

682
01:43:47,480 --> 01:44:02,480
Oh no! The fucking last song! Oh my heart can't take this!

683
01:44:02,480 --> 01:44:20,480
No more baby crying enemies please! Give me action next time!

684
01:44:20,480 --> 01:44:42,480
Oh my god. Why are they pranking us like this?

685
01:44:42,480 --> 01:44:54,480
No the last fucking words.

686
01:45:12,480 --> 01:45:41,480
No! Am I gonna be greeting at the end of every episode?

687
01:45:41,480 --> 01:46:00,480
Oh it's not!

688
01:46:11,480 --> 01:46:31,480
Until the next mission I guess.

689
01:46:31,480 --> 01:46:38,480
We need to fucking watch anime that don't make me cry.

690
01:46:38,480 --> 01:46:45,480
Oh come on! I'm fucking sick! That was like the fucking stupid thing!

691
01:46:45,480 --> 01:46:58,480
I'm fucking serious! I'm gonna be sick watching this anime!

692
01:46:58,480 --> 01:47:08,480
I'm okay though. I promise I'm okay. I just don't want to be sad.

693
01:47:08,480 --> 01:47:25,480
We're ready for episode 5. I'm ready to keep going. I'm gonna get a coma.

694
01:47:25,480 --> 01:47:35,480
Is it good anime? I don't know what the problem is. It's really good anime. I read it very highly.

695
01:47:35,480 --> 01:47:41,480
Are you ready for episode 5 everyone? Cause I'm ready for episode 5!

696
01:47:42,480 --> 01:47:50,480
Oh my god! They did not have to do that fucking birth scene!

697
01:47:50,480 --> 01:47:56,480
Right I'm gonna go get a can of cola. I'm gonna go for a pee as well.

698
01:47:56,480 --> 01:48:01,480
Everyone go get a pee and a can of cola.

699
01:48:01,480 --> 01:48:06,480
I'm not picking a sad fucking make me a weave next month. That's all I'm saying.

700
01:48:06,480 --> 01:48:12,480
We need to pick happy anime cause I can't take this fucking emotional damage.

701
01:48:12,480 --> 01:48:19,480
Go for a pee and get some drink. I'm gonna take a minute to pee as well. I'll be back in a moment.

702
01:48:31,480 --> 01:48:36,480
I'm gonna get a can of cola.

703
01:49:01,480 --> 01:49:06,480
I'm gonna get a can of cola.

704
01:49:31,480 --> 01:49:36,480
I'm gonna get a can of cola.

705
01:50:02,480 --> 01:50:09,480
Alright who's ready to get their ass beat by Salami?

706
01:50:09,480 --> 01:50:17,480
Okay next time we're just watching Hentai. I can't take this emotional damage.

707
01:50:17,480 --> 01:50:25,480
I got a cola bottle of water and a cheese string to make myself feel better.

708
01:50:25,480 --> 01:50:32,480
I'm sure there's... I wanna rewatch that purple succulence one.

709
01:50:32,480 --> 01:50:35,480
I actually got purple here.

710
01:50:35,480 --> 01:50:38,480
Cheese string? Yeah the cheese is gonna make me feel better.

711
01:50:38,480 --> 01:50:43,480
I'm gonna drink some water though.

712
01:50:43,480 --> 01:50:49,480
Yeah you're in the trenches with me right now. Bro who's fucking picked this anime?

713
01:50:49,480 --> 01:50:53,480
Okay we're ready for episode 5.

714
01:50:53,480 --> 01:50:58,480
Surely I will not be crying any further after that raw copy.

715
01:50:58,480 --> 01:51:02,480
Surely I will not drop any tears for the rest of this anime.

716
01:51:02,480 --> 01:51:05,480
Are you ready? On go.

717
01:51:05,480 --> 01:51:10,480
Three, two, one, go.

718
01:51:10,480 --> 01:51:18,480
Yes a beautiful church. Which does admire the architecture. Surely I'm not gonna cry any further.

719
01:51:19,480 --> 01:51:26,480
I'm opening up my cheese string. Oh my god it's us.

720
01:51:26,480 --> 01:51:37,480
I can't rip it open. You give me these claws.

721
01:51:38,480 --> 01:51:46,480
Oh AI and man are getting married in secret.

722
01:51:53,480 --> 01:51:56,480
Curious. Curious.

723
01:51:56,480 --> 01:52:03,480
As I said we're gonna skip the credits because they're leaking stuff and I don't want leaks.

724
01:52:03,480 --> 01:52:06,480
I'm the only one that's allowed to leak.

725
01:52:06,480 --> 01:52:12,480
So we've deviated the course of history. We've started a new branch.

726
01:52:12,480 --> 01:52:15,480
Okay.

727
01:52:15,480 --> 01:52:19,480
The Love Island is an AI metropolis.

728
01:52:19,480 --> 01:52:23,480
Analysing.

729
01:52:23,480 --> 01:52:30,480
Please do not be about the sky. I'm trying to eat and I'll vomit.

730
01:52:30,480 --> 01:52:33,480
My pleasure.

731
01:52:33,480 --> 01:52:36,480
Okay I'll be strong.

732
01:52:36,480 --> 01:52:40,480
We're happy again. I promise we're happy.

733
01:52:40,480 --> 01:52:44,480
Oh this will definitely not go bad. No.

734
01:52:52,480 --> 01:52:57,480
Seven years. I'm not sure how many years. He tells us. He's like oh it's been 10 years. It's been 15 years.

735
01:52:57,480 --> 01:53:05,480
So the we teddy bear will tell us. Okay I feel better now that I'm eating cheese.

736
01:53:05,480 --> 01:53:09,480
I'm secretly a mouse right now.

737
01:53:09,480 --> 01:53:12,480
Okay.

738
01:53:24,480 --> 01:53:27,480
Was that gorgeous that shot?

739
01:53:30,480 --> 01:53:33,480
Oh countdown.

740
01:53:40,480 --> 01:53:47,480
May as well give strongy clanned or angel beats? What does this mean? Sorry.

741
01:53:51,480 --> 01:53:57,480
I'm joking don't. No wait what does that mean? What what did you say? Wait what?

742
01:54:00,480 --> 01:54:04,480
Mommy no wait what does that mean? Clanned?

743
01:54:09,480 --> 01:54:16,480
Oh it's sad animes. Oh you want me to cry more? I'm not crying enough for you.

744
01:54:30,480 --> 01:54:33,480
Find a way to sneak in.

745
01:54:33,480 --> 01:54:36,480
I like how our room is changing.

746
01:54:40,480 --> 01:54:42,480
Hi.

747
01:54:50,480 --> 01:54:53,480
Oh he doesn't have to haze.

748
01:55:04,480 --> 01:55:06,480
Oh.

749
01:55:14,480 --> 01:55:17,480
Why is unexpected?

750
01:55:17,480 --> 01:55:23,480
This is 2.0 debut. Oh my god congrats. I forgot to buy fanart for the debut.

751
01:55:23,480 --> 01:55:25,480
2.0

752
01:55:29,480 --> 01:55:31,480
2.0

753
01:55:36,480 --> 01:55:38,480
Real.

754
01:55:38,480 --> 01:55:42,480
I don't know what I'm talking about.

755
01:55:42,480 --> 01:55:45,480
I don't know what I'm talking about.

756
01:55:45,480 --> 01:55:48,480
I don't know what I'm talking about.

757
01:55:48,480 --> 01:55:51,480
I don't know what I'm talking about.

758
01:55:51,480 --> 01:55:54,480
I don't know what I'm talking about.

759
01:55:54,480 --> 01:55:57,480
I don't know what I'm talking about.

760
01:55:57,480 --> 01:56:00,480
I don't know what I'm talking about.

761
01:56:00,480 --> 01:56:03,480
I don't know what I'm talking about.

762
01:56:04,480 --> 01:56:12,480
Now don't give me flashbacks. I'll start greeting again. Don't think I won't stop crying.

763
01:56:16,480 --> 01:56:21,480
No more sad violins. No more sad pianos. All happy.

764
01:56:21,480 --> 01:56:28,480
Don't make me cry while I'm eating my cheese string. I've almost finished it.

765
01:56:28,480 --> 01:56:30,480
I peel it apart.

766
01:56:30,480 --> 01:56:35,480
Into little tiny strings. It's like a cylinder of cheese I'm eating right now.

767
01:56:35,480 --> 01:56:37,480
And you've got to strip it apart.

768
01:56:37,480 --> 01:56:40,480
Into little tiny strings.

769
01:56:45,480 --> 01:56:48,480
We'll be analising.

770
01:56:51,480 --> 01:56:53,480
We'll be analising.

771
01:56:59,480 --> 01:57:01,480
And heels too.

772
01:57:01,480 --> 01:57:03,480
Wee woo.

773
01:57:15,480 --> 01:57:17,480
I'm just kidding.

774
01:57:18,480 --> 01:57:21,480
Oh no, there's cum!

775
01:57:21,480 --> 01:57:25,480
Slip caution, slippery when wet.

776
01:57:33,480 --> 01:57:35,480
Wheel.

777
01:57:37,480 --> 01:57:39,480
I've finished my cheese string.

778
01:57:39,480 --> 01:57:50,480
I'm sorry. Not our ink reserves.

779
01:57:50,480 --> 01:57:54,480
My batch of ink.

780
01:57:54,480 --> 01:57:57,480
Do you feel better now?

781
01:57:57,480 --> 01:57:59,480
Yeah.

782
01:57:59,480 --> 01:58:02,480
I have my snack here, I have my cola.

783
01:58:10,480 --> 01:58:15,480
I need to burp.

784
01:58:15,480 --> 01:58:19,480
Oh, that was sick. That was sick. Sorry.

785
01:58:19,480 --> 01:58:22,480
I'm sorry. Love you. I'm sorry.

786
01:58:22,480 --> 01:58:26,480
That was my stomach content so I was regurgitating.

787
01:58:26,480 --> 01:58:28,480
Sorry.

788
01:58:28,480 --> 01:58:35,480
I forgot I'm not allowed to burp if I'm upset because I puke when I get upset.

789
01:58:36,480 --> 01:58:40,480
I don't know if you get that, if I get too upset I'll throw up.

790
01:58:56,480 --> 01:58:59,480
Metal flute.

791
01:59:06,480 --> 01:59:08,480
Fuck.

792
01:59:12,480 --> 01:59:14,480
Boi up, T-Fuck!

793
01:59:20,480 --> 01:59:23,480
Sorry, that was my chair. Have you heard that?

794
01:59:28,480 --> 01:59:30,480
No.

795
01:59:31,480 --> 01:59:34,480
Like roof on the lake, was she?

796
01:59:43,480 --> 01:59:45,480
Ow.

797
01:59:46,480 --> 01:59:49,480
T-Fuck.

798
01:59:51,480 --> 01:59:53,480
Microwave.

799
01:59:54,480 --> 01:59:56,480
Er, yeah.

800
01:59:56,480 --> 01:59:58,480
Put a bit tin foil around it.

801
01:59:58,480 --> 02:00:00,480
We bet metal.

802
02:00:00,480 --> 02:00:02,480
Into the microwave.

803
02:00:02,480 --> 02:00:04,480
I don't know.

804
02:00:14,480 --> 02:00:18,480
He's been 5 years, but T-8 knows you're going to pass.

805
02:00:25,480 --> 02:00:27,480
Hello.

806
02:00:27,480 --> 02:00:29,480
Hi, Greg.

807
02:00:32,480 --> 02:00:34,480
Oh, Nanoboss.

808
02:01:02,480 --> 02:01:04,480
Hello.

809
02:01:13,480 --> 02:01:16,480
Until they fell in love with Greaves.

810
02:01:20,480 --> 02:01:23,480
I was like the symbolism of putting something out.

811
02:01:25,480 --> 02:01:28,480
That one was perfectly taken off, but it was from the anime.

812
02:01:32,480 --> 02:01:34,480
I don't know.

813
02:01:34,480 --> 02:01:36,480
I don't know.

814
02:01:59,480 --> 02:02:01,480
Breathe, breathe, breathe.

815
02:02:04,480 --> 02:02:06,480
Breathe, breathe.

816
02:02:19,480 --> 02:02:22,480
I bet my fondle abysmal be yours.

817
02:02:22,480 --> 02:02:24,480
Thank you, thank you.

818
02:02:24,480 --> 02:02:26,480
I'll be here.

819
02:02:26,480 --> 02:02:28,480
Don't you fall, he sounds really short.

820
02:02:50,480 --> 02:02:52,480
Have faith in me.

821
02:02:56,480 --> 02:02:58,480
I'll be here.

822
02:03:26,480 --> 02:03:28,480
What?

823
02:03:33,480 --> 02:03:35,480
Ah.

824
02:03:42,480 --> 02:03:44,480
That's so sweet.

825
02:03:44,480 --> 02:03:46,480
I'll be here.

826
02:03:54,480 --> 02:03:56,480
The business formal attire.

827
02:03:56,480 --> 02:03:58,480
Dig in up.

828
02:03:59,480 --> 02:04:01,480
Dig.

829
02:04:05,480 --> 02:04:07,480
What?

830
02:04:14,480 --> 02:04:16,480
Okay.

831
02:04:16,480 --> 02:04:18,480
Okay.

832
02:04:42,480 --> 02:04:44,480
Oh.

833
02:04:47,480 --> 02:04:50,480
They've made a cock block joke.

834
02:04:53,480 --> 02:04:55,480
Oh, they got jokes.

835
02:04:55,480 --> 02:04:57,480
They got stand-up comedy.

836
02:05:03,480 --> 02:05:05,480
Wait, what does it mean?

837
02:05:05,480 --> 02:05:07,480
I'm too slow.

838
02:05:17,480 --> 02:05:19,480
We're killing his wife?

839
02:05:23,480 --> 02:05:25,480
I'm not ready.

840
02:05:25,480 --> 02:05:27,480
I don't have enough tears in the tear duct just yet.

841
02:05:27,480 --> 02:05:29,480
You're going to need to slow down on the sad plots

842
02:05:29,480 --> 02:05:31,480
if that's what's going to happen.

843
02:05:31,480 --> 02:05:33,480
Bye.

844
02:05:47,480 --> 02:05:49,480
No.

845
02:06:12,480 --> 02:06:14,480
If we destroy,

846
02:06:14,480 --> 02:06:16,480
the island grace will perish too.

847
02:06:16,480 --> 02:06:19,480
Because there's no replacement things.

848
02:06:39,480 --> 02:06:42,480
Oh my god, it's a utopia for robots.

849
02:06:42,480 --> 02:06:45,480
It's like a spider web of connection.

850
02:06:47,480 --> 02:06:49,480
Sorry, I've still got to snore up my nose.

851
02:06:49,480 --> 02:06:51,480
Excuse me for a moment.

852
02:06:52,480 --> 02:06:54,480
I don't know if you understand.

853
02:06:55,480 --> 02:06:57,480
Hydrogen check.

854
02:07:01,480 --> 02:07:03,480
Hello, go home.

855
02:07:12,480 --> 02:07:14,480
Hello.

856
02:07:18,480 --> 02:07:20,480
He can fly, but they keep rolling.

857
02:07:20,480 --> 02:07:22,480
Rolling, rolling, rolling, rolling.

858
02:07:22,480 --> 02:07:24,480
What?

859
02:07:35,480 --> 02:07:37,480
Kitty.

860
02:07:42,480 --> 02:07:44,480
Kitty.

861
02:08:12,480 --> 02:08:14,480
Kitty.

862
02:08:22,480 --> 02:08:24,480
Like a safe house.

863
02:08:31,480 --> 02:08:33,480
Oh my god, hello.

864
02:08:33,480 --> 02:08:35,480
Hello.

865
02:08:40,480 --> 02:08:42,480
I enjoyed it.

866
02:08:50,480 --> 02:08:52,480
Descendant minions.

867
02:09:03,480 --> 02:09:05,480
Hello.

868
02:09:05,480 --> 02:09:07,480
Hello.

869
02:09:07,480 --> 02:09:09,480
Hello.

870
02:09:09,480 --> 02:09:11,480
Hello.

871
02:09:11,480 --> 02:09:13,480
Hello.

872
02:09:13,480 --> 02:09:15,480
Hello.

873
02:09:15,480 --> 02:09:17,480
Hello.

874
02:09:17,480 --> 02:09:19,480
Hello.

875
02:09:19,480 --> 02:09:21,480
Hello.

876
02:09:21,480 --> 02:09:23,480
Hello.

877
02:09:23,480 --> 02:09:25,480
Hello.

878
02:09:27,480 --> 02:09:29,480
Hello.

879
02:09:29,480 --> 02:09:31,480
Hello.

880
02:09:31,480 --> 02:09:33,480
Hello.

881
02:09:33,480 --> 02:09:35,480
Hello.

882
02:09:35,480 --> 02:09:37,480
Hello.

883
02:09:37,480 --> 02:09:39,480
Hello.

884
02:09:39,480 --> 02:09:41,480
Hello.

885
02:09:41,480 --> 02:09:43,480
Hello.

886
02:09:43,480 --> 02:09:45,480
Hello.

887
02:09:45,480 --> 02:09:47,480
Hello.

888
02:09:51,480 --> 02:09:53,480
Hello.

889
02:09:53,480 --> 02:09:55,480
Hello.

890
02:09:55,480 --> 02:09:58,480
Hello.

891
02:09:58,480 --> 02:10:00,480
Hello.

892
02:10:00,480 --> 02:10:25,480
Uh, y'all got any guns?

893
02:10:25,480 --> 02:10:50,480
Oh, you understand?

894
02:10:50,480 --> 02:11:05,480
Oh.

895
02:11:20,480 --> 02:11:39,480
Can we save it?

896
02:11:39,480 --> 02:11:52,480
Wouldn't it be better to assassinate Toke to prevent all this?

897
02:11:52,480 --> 02:11:59,480
Oh, we fucked up? What was in that code? It's red! Everything's red!

898
02:11:59,480 --> 02:12:10,480
Oh, we fucked up! We fucked up!

899
02:12:10,480 --> 02:12:17,480
Are we done, Guft?

900
02:12:17,480 --> 02:12:33,480
Well, you got your wish. You got your wish. Why don't you just kill Toke?

901
02:12:33,480 --> 02:12:43,480
You got your wish.

902
02:12:43,480 --> 02:12:46,480
Oh, fuck.

903
02:12:46,480 --> 02:12:52,480
Him again? Give it a rest, buddy. We've had enough of you. Wrap it up.

904
02:12:52,480 --> 02:12:59,480
You know, go get a fucking part-time job or something.

905
02:12:59,480 --> 02:13:03,480
Oh, my God, we fucking just fucked up the city.

906
02:13:03,480 --> 02:13:09,480
Whoa! I saw them titties. Hold on. Go back to frame. No, no, no. Don't roll the credit.

907
02:13:09,480 --> 02:13:12,480
Go back to frame. I saw them titties.

908
02:13:12,480 --> 02:13:14,480
Hold on. I see that again.

909
02:13:14,480 --> 02:13:17,480
I see that again one more time. Before we go to the next episode, hold on a minute.

910
02:13:18,480 --> 02:13:21,480
I knew what I saw. I knew what I saw.

911
02:13:21,480 --> 02:13:27,480
Right, episode six. I knew what I saw.

912
02:13:27,480 --> 02:13:32,480
I knew what I saw.

913
02:13:32,480 --> 02:13:35,480
Okay, we're ready for episode six.

914
02:13:35,480 --> 02:13:40,480
Team Rocket got a new rabbit. Team Rocket's blasting off again.

915
02:13:40,480 --> 02:13:42,480
Are you ready?

916
02:13:42,480 --> 02:13:46,480
As always, I will say three, two, one, go. I know I should probably not be spammed.

917
02:13:46,480 --> 02:13:48,480
Like, I should be given as a break to analyze that episode.

918
02:13:48,480 --> 02:13:51,480
But because I'm solo IQ, I can't analyze anything.

919
02:13:51,480 --> 02:13:55,480
So I'm just ready to go next, you know? Next.

920
02:13:55,480 --> 02:13:58,480
Booba to distract the two. Real.

921
02:13:58,480 --> 02:14:01,480
Okay. On the count of go.

922
02:14:01,480 --> 02:14:05,480
Three, two, one, go.

923
02:14:05,480 --> 02:14:10,480
I still don't have a scene that I want to get out of.

924
02:14:10,480 --> 02:14:13,480
Oh, we're going to learn by his piss.

925
02:14:23,480 --> 02:14:26,480
Oh.

926
02:14:30,480 --> 02:14:34,480
Oh, damn, this is short gone.

927
02:14:34,480 --> 02:14:37,480
Oh, fuck.

928
02:14:37,480 --> 02:14:40,480
That's him as a weed, right?

929
02:14:53,480 --> 02:14:57,480
I have terrible news. I think she's telling the truth.

930
02:15:08,480 --> 02:15:12,480
Oh, for fuck's sake, we're getting a bit technical, aren't we?

931
02:15:28,480 --> 02:15:31,480
Oh, I'm watching.

932
02:15:32,480 --> 02:15:38,480
New robot mum, real Andrew.

933
02:15:38,480 --> 02:15:41,480
Gentoo robot confirmed.

934
02:15:55,480 --> 02:15:58,480
Uh...

935
02:16:01,480 --> 02:16:07,480
I don't like where this is going. Call me John Tron, because I don't like where this is going.

936
02:16:07,480 --> 02:16:10,480
The scientists didn't even know this would happen.

937
02:16:10,480 --> 02:16:16,480
Well, so we teddy bear looked into it and was like, oh, I couldn't have come up with this.

938
02:16:16,480 --> 02:16:19,480
So I don't know why he's acting all surprised.

939
02:16:19,480 --> 02:16:21,480
Or was he? Maybe he wasn't...

940
02:16:21,480 --> 02:16:25,480
Maybe he was acting surprised at Vivi jumping in the water.

941
02:16:25,480 --> 02:16:29,480
But not surprised at the result.

942
02:16:29,480 --> 02:16:33,480
What if it goes there?

943
02:16:33,480 --> 02:16:39,480
There's something to be said for a dispassionate arbiter in hard emotional time.

944
02:16:59,480 --> 02:17:05,480
Mom, we need like a horny frame of something. Give us anything so I can get some artwork.

945
02:17:08,480 --> 02:17:13,480
Teddy bear is performing his role as magical girl's evil talking pet.

946
02:17:14,480 --> 02:17:18,480
He'd be up on the mirror like, hey, little mama, let me whisper in your ear.

947
02:17:29,480 --> 02:17:32,480
Uh...

948
02:17:47,480 --> 02:17:50,480
But it wasn't...

949
02:17:50,480 --> 02:17:54,480
told Feverino's, because he doesn't want his waifu to shut in.

950
02:18:00,480 --> 02:18:04,480
What part? Stay still, they won't understand.

951
02:18:07,480 --> 02:18:11,480
Because I'm not the one causing you harm, little fucker.

952
02:18:11,480 --> 02:18:19,480
What are you doing?

953
02:18:19,480 --> 02:18:23,480
What are you doing?

954
02:18:23,480 --> 02:18:26,480
No...

955
02:18:26,480 --> 02:18:29,480
vation...

956
02:18:29,480 --> 02:18:33,480
but a lie, while you're waiting.

957
02:18:33,480 --> 02:18:39,480
YAGACE

958
02:18:39,480 --> 02:19:04,480
Is he going to get redemption arc?

959
02:19:04,480 --> 02:19:14,480
Is he going to get redemption arc?

960
02:19:14,480 --> 02:19:24,480
Is he going to get redemption arc?

961
02:19:24,480 --> 02:19:48,480
Is he going to get redemption arc?

962
02:19:48,480 --> 02:20:04,480
Is he going to get redemption arc?

963
02:20:04,480 --> 02:20:24,480

04:13:52,480 --> 04:13:54,480
They didn't change anything after that, I don't know

1257
04:13:54,480 --> 04:14:00,480
Are you ready to go next?

1258
04:14:00,480 --> 04:14:02,480
Are you ready to go next?

1259
04:14:02,480 --> 04:14:20,480
I'm just going to wrap it all up

1260
04:14:20,480 --> 04:14:40,480
Okay, are you ready?

1261
04:14:40,480 --> 04:14:44,480
On goal, 3, 2, 1, go

1262
04:14:44,480 --> 04:15:10,480
That's all we fucking steered off the path

1263
04:15:10,480 --> 04:15:20,480
You're splitting all different

1264
04:15:40,480 --> 04:16:08,480
Can she even help?

1265
04:16:08,480 --> 04:16:32,480
Help

1266
04:16:32,480 --> 04:16:36,480
Everyone's terrified of AI

1267
04:16:36,480 --> 04:16:54,480
Oh

1268
04:16:54,480 --> 04:17:04,480
They identified hers, but

1269
04:17:04,480 --> 04:17:28,480
No

1270
04:17:28,480 --> 04:17:46,480
I hope everyone's having a good time

1271
04:17:46,480 --> 04:17:52,480
Oh yeah, you could say that

1272
04:17:52,480 --> 04:18:06,480
Kinda

1273
04:18:06,480 --> 04:18:28,480
Group karaoke, look what happens

1274
04:18:28,480 --> 04:18:36,480
I don't know, singers on the make spoil the audio

1275
04:18:36,480 --> 04:18:40,480
I farted

1276
04:18:40,480 --> 04:18:54,480
But in the end, it didn't even matter

1277
04:18:54,480 --> 04:19:00,480
I'm very curious how this ends

1278
04:19:00,480 --> 04:19:08,480
I'm very curious

1279
04:19:08,480 --> 04:19:30,480
This is brutal

1280
04:19:30,480 --> 04:19:40,480
Thank you for watching

1281
04:20:00,480 --> 04:20:12,480
It was

1282
04:20:12,480 --> 04:20:16,480
It was

1283
04:20:16,480 --> 04:20:26,480
That's him right here

1284
04:20:26,480 --> 04:20:42,480
Where is

1285
04:20:42,480 --> 04:20:56,480
We're there

1286
04:20:56,480 --> 04:21:14,480
We did something though

1287
04:21:14,480 --> 04:21:30,480
We'll send it

1288
04:21:30,480 --> 04:21:40,480
I'm a bit too slow for this scene

1289
04:22:00,480 --> 04:22:20,480
Oh

1290
04:22:20,480 --> 04:22:30,480
Do I not need to keep the timeline going and send it?

1291
04:22:30,480 --> 04:22:58,480
Oh

1292
04:22:58,480 --> 04:23:08,480
The birdies come in the goodies

1293
04:23:08,480 --> 04:23:28,480
Chaps about taking half a year's time

1294
04:23:28,480 --> 04:23:44,480
What could you do against that, honestly?

1295
04:23:44,480 --> 04:24:04,480
Oh

1296
04:24:04,480 --> 04:24:10,480
Elizabeth?

1297
04:24:10,480 --> 04:24:20,480
Yeah, that can be right

1298
04:24:40,480 --> 04:24:50,480
Oh

1299
04:25:10,480 --> 04:25:38,480
No

1300
04:25:38,480 --> 04:26:00,480
Yeah, it's Elizabeth

1301
04:26:00,480 --> 04:26:10,480
Uh

1302
04:26:30,480 --> 04:26:50,480
She has the clown tags of that guy that turned into a machine in her head

1303
04:26:50,480 --> 04:27:00,480
Oh

1304
04:27:20,480 --> 04:27:40,480
Oh

1305
04:27:40,480 --> 04:28:00,480
Yeah

1306
04:28:00,480 --> 04:28:10,480
Hmm

1307
04:28:10,480 --> 04:28:20,480
I'm like 90% sure we technically perished him

1308
04:28:30,480 --> 04:28:44,480
Yeah

1309
04:28:44,480 --> 04:29:06,480
I was there

1310
04:29:06,480 --> 04:29:16,480
Oh

1311
04:29:36,480 --> 04:29:46,480
Oh

1312
04:29:46,480 --> 04:30:06,480
Hmm

1313
04:30:06,480 --> 04:30:16,480
Hmm

1314
04:30:36,480 --> 04:30:56,480
Okay, thank you

1315
04:31:06,480 --> 04:31:16,480
I'm facing my pastoral

1316
04:31:16,480 --> 04:31:26,480
Okay

1317
04:31:46,480 --> 04:32:06,480
Okay

1318
04:32:06,480 --> 04:32:26,480
Okay

1319
04:32:26,480 --> 04:32:42,480
He's pissing

1320
04:32:42,480 --> 04:32:56,480
Sorry

1321
04:32:56,480 --> 04:33:06,480
I don't know where this is gonna go

1322
04:33:26,480 --> 04:33:38,480
A little bit

1323
04:33:38,480 --> 04:34:06,480
Singin' with you

1324
04:34:06,480 --> 04:34:26,480
Hmm

1325
04:34:26,480 --> 04:34:32,480
One upgrade, thanks

1326
04:34:32,480 --> 04:34:42,480
That's the Moto Peeler class

1327
04:35:02,480 --> 04:35:18,480
We get to blow up, T-Fuck

1328
04:35:18,480 --> 04:35:46,480
Uh

1329
04:35:46,480 --> 04:35:56,480
We can't even make it to space

1330
04:35:56,480 --> 04:36:06,480
There's a sulka

1331
04:36:06,480 --> 04:36:16,480
What

1332
04:36:16,480 --> 04:36:36,480
Hmm

1333
04:36:36,480 --> 04:36:44,480
I didn't fucking end it there, what the fuck

1334
04:36:44,480 --> 04:36:54,480
Okay

1335
04:36:54,480 --> 04:37:04,480
Episode 12

1336
04:37:04,480 --> 04:37:14,480
Are you ready for episode 12

1337
04:37:14,480 --> 04:37:24,480
Ready

1338
04:37:24,480 --> 04:37:34,480
Okay

1339
04:37:34,480 --> 04:37:50,480
What

1340
04:37:50,480 --> 04:38:00,480
There's one more episode after this, okay

1341
04:38:00,480 --> 04:38:10,480
Okay

1342
04:38:10,480 --> 04:38:20,480
Okay

1343
04:38:20,480 --> 04:38:30,480
Okay

1344
04:38:30,480 --> 04:38:50,480
Okay

1345
04:38:50,480 --> 04:39:10,480
This anime has grown on me

1346
04:39:10,480 --> 04:39:20,480
Okay

1347
04:39:20,480 --> 04:39:30,480
Ready

1348
04:39:30,480 --> 04:39:50,480
Okay

1349
04:39:50,480 --> 04:40:10,480
Oh

1350
04:40:10,480 --> 04:40:30,480
Okay

1351
04:40:30,480 --> 04:40:50,480
Okay

1352
04:40:50,480 --> 04:41:10,480
Hmm

1353
04:41:10,480 --> 04:41:38,480
Okay

1354
04:41:38,480 --> 04:42:06,480
What the fuck did it say

1355
04:42:06,480 --> 04:42:22,480
Hmm

1356
04:42:22,480 --> 04:42:42,480
The silence important part to drop later, real

1357
04:42:42,480 --> 04:42:52,480
Okay

1358
04:43:12,480 --> 04:43:32,480
Hmm

1359
04:43:32,480 --> 04:43:52,480
Okay

1360
04:43:52,480 --> 04:44:12,480
Okay

1361
04:44:12,480 --> 04:44:40,480
Okay

1362
04:44:40,480 --> 04:44:50,480
Hmm

1363
04:44:50,480 --> 04:45:00,480
Oh the dialogue, they're hating so much dialogue from us

1364
04:45:00,480 --> 04:45:16,480
Stop hating the dialogue

1365
04:45:16,480 --> 04:45:28,480
Hmm

1366
04:45:28,480 --> 04:45:42,480
Hmm

1367
04:45:42,480 --> 04:46:04,480
I'm getting nervous

1368
04:46:04,480 --> 04:46:24,480
I'm getting nervous

1369
04:46:24,480 --> 04:46:44,480
I'm getting nervous

1370
04:46:44,480 --> 04:47:04,480
I'm getting nervous

1371
04:47:04,480 --> 04:47:24,480
I'm getting nervous

1372
04:47:24,480 --> 04:47:52,480
I'm getting nervous

1373
04:47:52,480 --> 04:48:02,480
No

1374
04:48:22,480 --> 04:48:50,480
Oh

1375
04:48:50,480 --> 04:49:18,480
Okay

1376
04:49:18,480 --> 04:49:28,480
Hmm

1377
04:49:28,480 --> 04:49:54,480
Oh

1378
04:49:54,480 --> 04:50:22,480
Okay

1379
04:50:22,480 --> 04:50:32,480
Okay

1380
04:50:32,480 --> 04:50:54,480
It's him but evil

1381
04:50:54,480 --> 04:51:22,480
The fuck we got shagged

1382
04:51:22,480 --> 04:51:32,480
The fuck we got shagged

1383
04:51:52,480 --> 04:52:12,480
Okay

1384
04:52:12,480 --> 04:52:32,480
Hmm

1385
04:52:32,480 --> 04:53:00,480
We failed

1386
04:53:00,480 --> 04:53:10,480
Huh

1387
04:53:10,480 --> 04:53:20,480
You can feel anatomy

1388
04:53:20,480 --> 04:53:30,480
Okay

1389
04:53:30,480 --> 04:53:40,480
Okay

1390
04:53:40,480 --> 04:53:50,480
Okay

1391
04:54:10,480 --> 04:54:30,480
Okay

1392
04:54:30,480 --> 04:54:40,480
Okay

1393
04:55:00,480 --> 04:55:20,480
Okay

1394
04:55:20,480 --> 04:55:30,480
Okay

1395
04:55:50,480 --> 04:56:00,480
Okay

1396
04:56:20,480 --> 04:56:30,480
Okay

1397
04:56:30,480 --> 04:56:50,480
Okay

1398
04:56:50,480 --> 04:57:00,480
Okay

1399
04:57:00,480 --> 04:57:10,480
Okay

1400
04:57:30,480 --> 04:57:50,480
Okay

1401
04:57:50,480 --> 04:58:00,480
Okay

1402
04:58:00,480 --> 04:58:10,480
Okay

1403
04:58:30,480 --> 04:58:50,480
Okay

1404
04:58:50,480 --> 04:58:58,480
Okay

1405
04:58:58,480 --> 04:59:08,480
Okay

1406
04:59:08,480 --> 04:59:18,480
Okay

1407
04:59:18,480 --> 04:59:26,480
Okay

1408
04:59:26,480 --> 04:59:46,480
Okay

1409
04:59:46,480 --> 04:59:56,480
Okay

1410
04:59:56,480 --> 05:00:06,480
Okay

1411
05:00:06,480 --> 05:00:26,480
Okay

1412
05:00:26,480 --> 05:00:46,480
Okay

1413
05:00:46,480 --> 05:00:56,480
Okay

1414
05:00:56,480 --> 05:01:04,480
Does it look right on your end though for episode 13?

1415
05:01:04,480 --> 05:01:08,480
Does this look wrong?

1416
05:01:08,480 --> 05:01:12,480
Is this episode 13.5? Wait a minute, have I put the wrong one on?

1417
05:01:12,480 --> 05:01:20,480
I put the wrong one on! Hold on! Hold on! Pause! I put the wrong one on! I put the wrong one on! I put 13.5 on!

1418
05:01:20,480 --> 05:01:26,480
Maybe this is English. Copy them. Maybe this is English. Hold on! Hold on! I put the over on! I put the over on!

1419
05:01:26,480 --> 05:01:32,480
Cause it was 13.5 in the file, it comes before 13. Hold on a minute! Everyone bring it back! Bring it back!

1420
05:01:32,480 --> 05:01:38,480
Bring it back meddd! and go back to the start. Back to the start meee!

1421
05:01:38,480 --> 05:01:42,480
That's the rewind sound, okay? Sorry there's an over episode and it was in Japanese.

1422
05:01:42,480 --> 05:01:52,480
Okay. Ready? For episode 13, okay? 3..2..1..GO.

1423
05:01:52,480 --> 05:01:57,760
Please be English. Please be English. Please be English. I'm too small-brained

1424
05:01:57,760 --> 05:02:04,640
to read subtitles at the same time. Give me that English. I even know what an over is. I just said

1425
05:02:04,640 --> 05:02:14,960
over. Give me that English. Okay, there's that dreaded song.

1426
05:02:22,480 --> 05:02:34,960
I don't know what happens to him. Or something else is going to happen to him.

1427
05:02:34,960 --> 05:02:53,360
Okay, it's in English. We're winning. Emotional reattachment coming back in.

1428
05:03:05,680 --> 05:03:22,960
Hi. Pleasure.

1429
05:03:22,960 --> 05:03:30,960
Would mummies still love us even if we wrote in Japanese? I would just, it would be harder because I need to read.

1430
05:03:31,360 --> 05:03:38,960
You know that anime that is like, read, read. And I'm like, no. Title drop in the episode.

1431
05:03:47,680 --> 05:03:54,480
Didn't even know if I got an English dub. You know, you all know my secret. I've been

1432
05:03:54,560 --> 05:04:01,840
listening in English all the time. You've been listening in Japanese this whole time?

1433
05:04:06,640 --> 05:04:10,560
I feel like it's so much harder to read the subtitles and get so emotionally involved.

1434
05:04:10,560 --> 05:04:16,160
We figured it out. No. You never know my secret. I'm a fake weeb.

1435
05:04:25,200 --> 05:04:33,120
English. I figured since there are no subs in the blur image.

1436
05:04:36,720 --> 05:04:41,520
We must weeb a five or more. Plop, plop, plop. Get weeped, get weeped, get weeped. Really get

1437
05:04:41,520 --> 05:04:54,160
weeped. Fakling mummy, honestly. We'll have to return you to the store, real.

1438
05:05:11,520 --> 05:05:22,160
Most weebs got a job and can't watch anymore. And directly anymore.

1439
05:06:11,520 --> 05:06:36,160
Sorry, I saw him lift the gun out. I'll do the sound effects for you.

1440
05:06:41,840 --> 05:06:52,160
Pursuing or what?

1441
05:06:56,160 --> 05:07:10,160
You wanna go?

1442
05:07:11,520 --> 05:07:27,920
Okay.

1443
05:07:27,920 --> 05:07:45,920
Okay.

1444
05:07:45,920 --> 05:07:53,920
Where are you making those lines in your head when we...

1445
05:07:53,920 --> 05:08:14,920
I just hit the biggest fucking floor ever.

1446
05:08:14,920 --> 05:08:18,920
You wanna sniff?

1447
05:08:18,920 --> 05:08:28,920
Okay, they're gonna do it.

1448
05:08:28,920 --> 05:08:30,920
Canee!

1449
05:08:30,920 --> 05:08:32,920
Pregento?

1450
05:08:32,920 --> 05:08:33,920
Absolutely.

1451
05:08:48,920 --> 05:08:55,920
Some day it's not gonna be a farm.

1452
05:08:55,920 --> 05:08:59,920
Folks say that. They're like, oh, if you never shit yourself, it'll happen eventually.

1453
05:08:59,920 --> 05:09:09,920
I mean, I'm doing pretty good so far. My record is zero, so... I don't know.

1454
05:09:09,920 --> 05:09:12,920
Canee!

1455
05:09:12,920 --> 05:09:32,920
Indulged in one... Canee?

1456
05:09:32,920 --> 05:09:41,920
I get to hear you this time.

1457
05:09:41,920 --> 05:09:46,920
Canee!

1458
05:09:46,920 --> 05:09:47,920
You plopped in the water.

1459
05:10:11,920 --> 05:10:20,920
Aww.

1460
05:10:20,920 --> 05:10:28,920
Little bubba. Thank you, Teddy. Let's do it in the same.

1461
05:10:28,920 --> 05:10:31,920
Canee! Too canee!

1462
05:10:31,920 --> 05:10:37,920
Indulged in two... Confirmed.

1463
05:10:37,920 --> 05:10:44,920
The too canee.

1464
05:10:44,920 --> 05:10:52,920
She's gonna sing the can song.

1465
05:10:52,920 --> 05:10:57,920
Right, this time we're wrapping tinfoil in it. We put the wrong can to think.

1466
05:10:57,920 --> 05:11:01,920
We put bacon paper over it instead of the other can.

1467
05:11:01,920 --> 05:11:04,920
I'm setting up for this again.

1468
05:11:04,920 --> 05:11:08,920
My legs are crisscross applesauce as the American say.

1469
05:11:08,920 --> 05:11:11,920
And they're in the right timeline!

1470
05:11:11,920 --> 05:11:14,920
Oh, that's a bit sad.

1471
05:11:14,920 --> 05:11:17,920
At least he gets to be with life and the kids.

1472
05:11:17,920 --> 05:11:23,920
Tinfoil time, tinfoil time.

1473
05:11:23,920 --> 05:11:25,920
Okay, let's see.

1474
05:11:31,920 --> 05:11:53,920
I have a little bit of bread, Brun.

1475
05:11:53,920 --> 05:12:04,920
What?

1476
05:12:04,920 --> 05:12:17,920
She fucking gave her her last lanes? Ooh.

1477
05:12:17,920 --> 05:12:20,920
Fucking read her last words? I'm not sure about that, Ian.

1478
05:12:20,920 --> 05:12:25,920
That was a really unique...

1479
05:12:25,920 --> 05:12:28,920
By the way, when you were dying, this is what you said to me.

1480
05:12:28,920 --> 05:12:39,920
What the fuck?

1481
05:12:39,920 --> 05:12:43,920
Oh dear, oh dear. Hydration check. Oh dear, oh dear.

1482
05:12:43,920 --> 05:12:52,920
Sorry, I've got dry throat.

1483
05:12:52,920 --> 05:12:56,920
Okay, hydration, hydration, hydration.

1484
05:12:56,920 --> 05:13:01,920
I'm going to hold the move, rather cocky.

1485
05:13:01,920 --> 05:13:09,920
I think she's really held up well.

1486
05:13:09,920 --> 05:13:25,920
Hmm?

1487
05:13:25,920 --> 05:13:51,920
Hmm.

1488
05:13:51,920 --> 05:14:14,920
Hmm.

1489
05:14:14,920 --> 05:14:41,920
Damn.

1490
05:14:41,920 --> 05:14:55,920
Can it touch us?

1491
05:14:55,920 --> 05:15:07,920
What?

1492
05:15:07,920 --> 05:15:34,920
Yeah, that's it.

1493
05:15:34,920 --> 05:15:47,920
Okay.

1494
05:15:47,920 --> 05:16:05,920
I have to comment.

1495
05:16:05,920 --> 05:16:19,920
Hmm.

1496
05:16:19,920 --> 05:16:24,920
Sorry, that was my tummy if you heard that.

1497
05:16:49,920 --> 05:16:59,920
Hmm.

1498
05:17:49,920 --> 05:18:04,920
But her deal?

1499
05:18:34,920 --> 05:18:49,920
Hmm.

1500
05:19:04,920 --> 05:19:32,920
Why does that have to kill her to sing though?

1501
05:19:32,920 --> 05:19:37,920
Why does that have to kill her to sing though?

1502
05:20:02,920 --> 05:20:27,920
Hmm.

1503
05:20:27,920 --> 05:20:52,920
Hmm.

1504
05:20:52,920 --> 05:21:17,920
Hmm.

1505
05:21:17,920 --> 05:21:43,920
Hmm.

1506
05:21:43,920 --> 05:22:09,920
Hmm.

1507
05:22:09,920 --> 05:22:34,920
Did she really have to die?

1508
05:22:34,920 --> 05:22:44,920
A few tears.

1509
05:22:44,920 --> 05:23:11,920
I don't get it, I don't really get it.

1510
05:23:11,920 --> 05:23:21,920
That's it, that's it.

1511
05:23:21,920 --> 05:23:34,920
There's no happy ending.

1512
05:23:34,920 --> 05:23:40,920
Fucking write a happy ending, challenge impossible.

1513
05:23:40,920 --> 05:23:42,920
So what's an oval then?

1514
05:23:42,920 --> 05:23:49,920
I don't understand what an oval is.

1515
05:23:49,920 --> 05:24:13,920
Oh it's the man she saved.

1516
05:24:13,920 --> 05:24:35,920
Is that her eyes?

1517
05:24:35,920 --> 05:24:59,920
No.

1518
05:25:05,920 --> 05:25:16,920
What?

1519
05:25:16,920 --> 05:25:27,920
I don't understand.

1520
05:25:27,920 --> 05:25:56,920
That's it, that's the fucking end.

1521
05:25:56,920 --> 05:26:04,920
Bro, how am I supposed to win me when you're in chess when I look like this?

1522
05:26:04,920 --> 05:26:11,920
So that's the end of that storyline, there's no like season 2.

1523
05:26:11,920 --> 05:26:18,920
No notes from the director being like in another universe, she's still right there.

1524
05:26:18,920 --> 05:26:24,920
That's like grey.

1525
05:26:24,920 --> 05:26:49,920
That's it.

1526
05:26:50,920 --> 05:27:00,920
Well literally the AI pops up again?

1527
05:27:00,920 --> 05:27:06,920
I'm in shambles but that was a good time, I mean...

1528
05:27:06,920 --> 05:27:11,920
But we won't do that, we don't want to do that.

1529
05:27:11,920 --> 05:27:14,920
It's kind of nice to have this ending when it's in a while, speak for yourself.

1530
05:27:14,920 --> 05:27:25,920
I'm not sure what to think.

1531
05:27:25,920 --> 05:27:34,920
I don't know, I think you have to think for me unironically, I'm like...

1532
05:27:34,920 --> 05:27:36,920
Vivi will live on in her memories?

1533
05:27:36,920 --> 05:27:40,920
Can we not just all hold hands and get along?

1534
05:27:40,920 --> 05:27:43,920
Oh my god, don't be so dramatic.

1535
05:27:43,920 --> 05:27:48,920
Can we like hold hands and get along?

1536
05:27:48,920 --> 05:27:51,920
Oh my god.

1537
05:27:51,920 --> 05:27:54,920
That was awful.

1538
05:27:54,920 --> 05:27:56,920
I don't know about you but that was fucking awful.

1539
05:27:56,920 --> 05:28:05,920
Oh I'm getting flashbanged.

1540
05:28:05,920 --> 05:28:18,920
I love watching sad ending animes for some reason, showing us what happens in that.

1541
05:28:18,920 --> 05:28:23,920
Humans and AI found a way to live in harmony without the war.

1542
05:28:23,920 --> 05:28:32,920
I mean I hope that's what the ending implied.

1543
05:28:32,920 --> 05:28:36,920
She succeeded but the cost of her own life she fulfilled her mission.

1544
05:28:36,920 --> 05:28:39,920
Would you rather end on episode 12?

1545
05:28:39,920 --> 05:28:42,920
I don't know what happened on episode 12.

1546
05:28:42,920 --> 05:28:45,920
I don't know what to feel, fuck.

1547
05:28:45,920 --> 05:28:51,920
Now I'm going to be honest, I was supposed to be stream sniped in chess.

1548
05:28:51,920 --> 05:28:57,920
I'm going to be honest, I don't really feel like battling out over the fucking knight in the bishop right now.

1549
05:28:57,920 --> 05:29:02,920
I'm a bit distraught after that anime.

1550
05:29:02,920 --> 05:29:05,920
I'm not going to lie.

1551
05:29:05,920 --> 05:29:07,920
Everyone died with the style.

1552
05:29:07,920 --> 05:29:10,920
I mean shit, it's a better ending.

1553
05:29:10,920 --> 05:29:12,920
But fuck, can we have a good ending?

1554
05:29:12,920 --> 05:29:14,920
And Vivi, is that too much to ask for?

1555
05:29:14,920 --> 05:29:16,920
They fucking cut her hair and everything.

1556
05:29:16,920 --> 05:29:23,920
You couldn't have made her look older if you wanted to.

1557
05:29:23,920 --> 05:29:26,920
I mean shit, I'm like if I look at marshmallows are they going to cheer me up?

1558
05:29:26,920 --> 05:29:30,920
Or is it going to be like, here's my booby.

1559
05:29:30,920 --> 05:29:39,920
Okay.

1560
05:29:39,920 --> 05:29:41,920
Yeah, anime.

1561
05:29:41,920 --> 05:29:47,920
Ten out of ten on the anime.

1562
05:29:47,920 --> 05:29:49,920
I mean, I don't even know what to say.

1563
05:29:49,920 --> 05:29:54,920
I think I need to sleep on it, honestly.

1564
05:29:54,920 --> 05:29:56,920
I don't think I'm ready for chess either.

1565
05:29:56,920 --> 05:29:58,920
Okay, I'm glad we're in agreement with that.

1566
05:29:58,920 --> 05:30:01,920
Our boobies don't cheer her up, she hates us.

1567
05:30:01,920 --> 05:30:08,920
I don't like, oh the fuck.

1568
05:30:08,920 --> 05:30:12,920
I think I need a nap after that, honestly.

1569
05:30:12,920 --> 05:30:15,920
That was cheeky.

1570
05:30:15,920 --> 05:30:21,920
Can we just watch hentai next time?

1571
05:30:21,920 --> 05:30:24,920
I feel like that'd be a lot more easier for me.

1572
05:30:24,920 --> 05:30:27,920
Top-rated hentai at school.

1573
05:30:27,920 --> 05:30:30,920
You think I'm joking?

1574
05:30:30,920 --> 05:30:36,920
Best hentai anime, top ten one.

1575
05:30:36,920 --> 05:30:37,920
Number one.

1576
05:30:37,920 --> 05:30:41,920
Boku to joy and emotions.

1577
05:30:41,920 --> 05:30:44,920
I can read that.

1578
05:30:44,920 --> 05:30:46,920
Yeah, we're doing something nice next time.

1579
05:30:46,920 --> 05:30:47,920
I'm like emotionally distraught.

1580
05:30:47,920 --> 05:30:49,920
I don't know how you look right now,

1581
05:30:49,920 --> 05:30:52,920
but my eyes are bulging at my skull from the puffiness.

1582
05:30:52,920 --> 05:30:54,920
You should try keigo.

1583
05:30:54,920 --> 05:30:59,920
Why not do a keigo on your tentacle?

1584
05:30:59,920 --> 05:31:03,920
Made an absolute lie out of that stream title though.

1585
05:31:03,920 --> 05:31:07,920
Oh god, what did I name the stream?

1586
05:31:07,920 --> 05:31:09,920
Am I going to cry?

1587
05:31:09,920 --> 05:31:13,920
Bruh, I cried every single episode, I think.

1588
05:31:13,920 --> 05:31:14,920
That was awful.

1589
05:31:14,920 --> 05:31:16,920
Are you squiddin' me right now?

1590
05:31:16,920 --> 05:31:17,920
Narrow, thank you.

1591
05:31:17,920 --> 05:31:20,920
Hope you liked it, mama-colon-nundaskor-love.

1592
05:31:20,920 --> 05:31:22,920
Sorry I made you cry.

1593
05:31:22,920 --> 05:31:23,920
It's a good anime though.

1594
05:31:23,920 --> 05:31:25,920
The music too, colon-nundaskor-love.

1595
05:31:25,920 --> 05:31:27,920
The music was beautiful.

1596
05:31:27,920 --> 05:31:30,920
I liked that the intro and the outro had different things.

1597
05:31:30,920 --> 05:31:31,920
Pardon me.

1598
05:31:31,920 --> 05:31:34,920
Thank you, Narrow, for the super chat.

1599
05:31:34,920 --> 05:31:40,920
Sorry I'm burping.

1600
05:31:40,920 --> 05:31:42,920
I need something silly in fan service.

1601
05:31:42,920 --> 05:31:44,920
Yes, please.

1602
05:31:44,920 --> 05:31:47,920
What made you cry the most?

1603
05:31:47,920 --> 05:31:49,920
I'm crying, thinking about it.

1604
05:31:49,920 --> 05:31:52,920
The two birds when the sisters went down in the ship.

1605
05:31:52,920 --> 05:31:54,920
Just a wee bit sad.

1606
05:31:54,920 --> 05:32:00,920
Just a little bit sad when they went up into space.

1607
05:32:00,920 --> 05:32:04,920
That part got me the most.

1608
05:32:04,920 --> 05:32:09,920
Because I didn't expect it.

1609
05:32:09,920 --> 05:32:10,920
Yeah, let's do it.

1610
05:32:10,920 --> 05:32:12,920
Let's do it next time.

1611
05:32:12,920 --> 05:32:15,920
I'll do that next time.

1612
05:32:15,920 --> 05:32:26,920
Is there anyone we can redirect into?

1613
05:32:26,920 --> 05:32:28,920
It says rescheduled on Mercy's stream.

1614
05:32:28,920 --> 05:32:32,920
Is she not streamin'?

1615
05:32:32,920 --> 05:32:35,920
Yes, I'm redirecting you five hours early.

1616
05:32:35,920 --> 05:32:38,920
Is she not?

1617
05:32:38,920 --> 05:32:39,920
Wait, I've been done.

1618
05:32:39,920 --> 05:32:41,920
1pm on the 6th.

1619
05:32:41,920 --> 05:32:42,920
Oh, it's not the 6th.

1620
05:32:42,920 --> 05:32:44,920
Okay, no one else is streamin' today.

1621
05:32:44,920 --> 05:32:46,920
As there is offline, Amazon, private.

1622
05:32:46,920 --> 05:32:50,920
Alright, I'll just leave it at that.

1623
05:32:50,920 --> 05:32:52,920
The crazy part is when Vivi came out,

1624
05:32:52,920 --> 05:32:55,920
many people skipped it because they saw the musical tag

1625
05:32:55,920 --> 05:32:58,920
and thought it was going to be a musical machine thing.

1626
05:32:58,920 --> 05:32:59,920
Yeah.

1627
05:32:59,920 --> 05:33:01,920
You always did love animals.

1628
05:33:01,920 --> 05:33:03,920
I can't handle an animal scene.

1629
05:33:03,920 --> 05:33:06,920
I'm just like, oh, I can't handle it.

1630
05:33:06,920 --> 05:33:08,920
Daily lives of high school boys.

1631
05:33:08,920 --> 05:33:11,920
It's 12 episodes long that's hilarious.

1632
05:33:11,920 --> 05:33:12,920
Okay.

1633
05:33:12,920 --> 05:33:13,920
It's okay, mummy.

1634
05:33:13,920 --> 05:33:16,920
We can have big, snotty, tear-filled cuddle sessions

1635
05:33:16,920 --> 05:33:18,920
to tear you off.

1636
05:33:18,920 --> 05:33:21,920
But your shirt would be soaked with that amount of tears

1637
05:33:21,920 --> 05:33:22,920
and snow.

1638
05:33:22,920 --> 05:33:24,920
I have to go around right now.

1639
05:33:24,920 --> 05:33:25,920
Oh.

1640
05:33:25,920 --> 05:33:26,920
Hey, Strony.

1641
05:33:26,920 --> 05:33:27,920
Hi, refund.

1642
05:33:27,920 --> 05:33:30,920
Another reason why someone might watch subtitles anime

1643
05:33:30,920 --> 05:33:32,920
is because of release time.

1644
05:33:32,920 --> 05:33:35,920
Normally, watching subs means you can watch it sooner

1645
05:33:35,920 --> 05:33:36,920
than later.

1646
05:33:36,920 --> 05:33:38,920
Dubs are slower to come out.

1647
05:33:38,920 --> 05:33:40,920
I was watching Naruto, the English dub

1648
05:33:40,920 --> 05:33:42,920
with like 100 episodes behind.

1649
05:33:42,920 --> 05:33:44,920
Oh, go, go, go, go.

1650
05:33:44,920 --> 05:33:46,920
Hey, mom, may I refund?

1651
05:33:46,920 --> 05:33:47,920
Hotel Internet keeps cutting out.

1652
05:33:47,920 --> 05:33:48,920
You know, hotel?

1653
05:33:48,920 --> 05:33:50,920
Who are you pumping?

1654
05:33:50,920 --> 05:33:52,920
I can only really watch the watch live,

1655
05:33:52,920 --> 05:33:54,920
but I wanted to say I love you.

1656
05:33:54,920 --> 05:33:56,920
And as Paris socials, it sends you a big part of my life

1657
05:33:56,920 --> 05:33:57,920
and encourages me to be a better person.

1658
05:33:57,920 --> 05:33:59,920
That's lovely, refund.

1659
05:33:59,920 --> 05:34:01,920
I'm so sorry I'm crying through you.

1660
05:34:01,920 --> 05:34:02,920
Read in your message.

1661
05:34:02,920 --> 05:34:04,920
I'm like tearing up.

1662
05:34:04,920 --> 05:34:06,920
Oh, I love you too, little refund.

1663
05:34:06,920 --> 05:34:08,920
I'm glad you're late.

1664
05:34:08,920 --> 05:34:11,920
It encouraged me to be a better person,

1665
05:34:11,920 --> 05:34:13,920
but I was inside you all along.

1666
05:34:13,920 --> 05:34:15,920
You just needed the motivations

1667
05:34:15,920 --> 05:34:17,920
and I gave you a little kick up your arse.

1668
05:34:17,920 --> 05:34:20,920
And now you get to be the best version of yourself.

1669
05:34:20,920 --> 05:34:21,920
Yeah?

1670
05:34:26,920 --> 05:34:28,920
I was thinking about your anime watch along

1671
05:34:28,920 --> 05:34:29,920
so it came to me in a flash.

1672
05:34:29,920 --> 05:34:31,920
Interviews with Monster Girls is one season.

1673
05:34:31,920 --> 05:34:33,920
It's basically a big Monster Girl lore fest

1674
05:34:33,920 --> 05:34:38,920
in a fairly comfy slice of life Monster Girl framework.

1675
05:34:38,920 --> 05:34:41,920
It's on the light end of each word,

1676
05:34:41,920 --> 05:34:43,920
but it has enough fan service.

1677
05:34:43,920 --> 05:34:45,920
Okay, maybe we'll do something like that.

1678
05:34:48,920 --> 05:34:52,920
It's fine, we love exposure to Mummy's emotions.

1679
05:34:52,920 --> 05:34:54,920
I don't want to make you so upset

1680
05:34:54,920 --> 05:34:56,920
when I'm greeting through everything though.

1681
05:34:56,920 --> 05:34:58,920
Like, all I do is cry.

1682
05:34:59,920 --> 05:35:02,920
Mummy, I'd like to second the Kaiju recommendation.

1683
05:35:02,920 --> 05:35:04,920
Silly fan service anime

1684
05:35:04,920 --> 05:35:06,920
and sports of girl butt bouncing themselves

1685
05:35:06,920 --> 05:35:08,920
off of platforms over war.

1686
05:35:08,920 --> 05:35:11,920
I think it's a reference to something I don't know yet.

1687
05:35:11,920 --> 05:35:14,920
Interview with Monster Girls is cute and fun, yeah.

1688
05:35:14,920 --> 05:35:16,920
We're gonna give, I mean, as I said,

1689
05:35:16,920 --> 05:35:18,920
this is only the fifth of this month,

1690
05:35:18,920 --> 05:35:21,920
so the next anime watch along is like a whole month away.

1691
05:35:21,920 --> 05:35:23,920
There's gonna be a big...

1692
05:35:23,920 --> 05:35:25,920
I'm not even sure I want to get anything

1693
05:35:25,920 --> 05:35:28,920
from a fan art of me and any of the scenes in this anime

1694
05:35:28,920 --> 05:35:30,920
because it has wrecked me.

1695
05:35:30,920 --> 05:35:32,920
Okay, I'm so upset.

1696
05:35:32,920 --> 05:35:34,920
At least for the first one, it's like, yeah, black male.

1697
05:35:34,920 --> 05:35:36,920
Yeah, fuck yeah, that's hot.

1698
05:35:38,920 --> 05:35:40,920
You get to put

1699
05:35:40,920 --> 05:35:42,920
my foot on your brooch type thing

1700
05:35:42,920 --> 05:35:44,920
in Britain, yeah, like that, that's good.

1701
05:35:44,920 --> 05:35:46,920
But yeah, we're not upset.

1702
05:35:46,920 --> 05:35:48,920
We're head partying and vaping.

1703
05:35:48,920 --> 05:35:50,920
I just don't want to make you too upset.

1704
05:35:50,920 --> 05:35:52,920
Well, I'm upset. Hope you feel better.

1705
05:35:52,920 --> 05:35:54,920
I don't know what a bobby is, but...

1706
05:35:54,920 --> 05:35:56,920
and then the reflins spell out

1707
05:35:56,920 --> 05:35:58,920
a weiner

1708
05:35:58,920 --> 05:36:00,920
and a bobby

1709
05:36:00,920 --> 05:36:02,920
in emoticons. A bobby

1710
05:36:02,920 --> 05:36:04,920
is a weiner.

1711
05:36:04,920 --> 05:36:06,920
A bobby is your tentacle.

1712
05:36:06,920 --> 05:36:08,920
You'd go, oh, mommy, my bobby's hard.

1713
05:36:10,920 --> 05:36:12,920
Stroney holding bird up to flying at this guy.

1714
05:36:12,920 --> 05:36:14,920
Are you trying to kill me? Because that'll kill me.

1715
05:36:14,920 --> 05:36:16,920
What about an artwork are you wearing Vivi's idol?

1716
05:36:16,920 --> 05:36:18,920
I think I'd throw up if I see

1717
05:36:18,920 --> 05:36:20,920
any more Vivi stuff for the next few days.

1718
05:36:20,920 --> 05:36:22,920
Hi, Stroney. Hi, reflin.

1719
05:36:22,920 --> 05:36:24,920
I found out I have mostly Scottish

1720
05:36:24,920 --> 05:36:26,920
and Irish heritage. We make be cousins.

1721
05:36:26,920 --> 05:36:28,920
You want to fuck your cousin?

1722
05:36:28,920 --> 05:36:30,920
I'm from Alabama.

1723
05:36:32,920 --> 05:36:34,920
Oh my gosh, I'm dying.

1724
05:36:34,920 --> 05:36:36,920
I can't help but cry with you, mommy.

1725
05:36:36,920 --> 05:36:38,920
Don't worry, we can get snot all over my shirt.

1726
05:36:38,920 --> 05:36:40,920
I don't mind.

1727
05:36:40,920 --> 05:36:42,920
Let me lift up your shirt and get

1728
05:36:42,920 --> 05:36:44,920
snot all over your skin.

1729
05:36:46,920 --> 05:36:48,920
You want me to blow my nose on you?

1730
05:36:48,920 --> 05:36:50,920
Jeez.

1731
05:36:52,920 --> 05:36:54,920
I'm not going to redirect into anyone

1732
05:36:54,920 --> 05:36:56,920
because I'm too emotionally drained

1733
05:36:56,920 --> 05:36:58,920
and I don't want to chat in someone's chat

1734
05:36:58,920 --> 05:37:00,920
being like, yeah, just watch

1735
05:37:00,920 --> 05:37:02,920
emotionally draining anime in my life.

1736
05:37:02,920 --> 05:37:04,920
By the way, don't watch Vivi. You'll die.

1737
05:37:06,920 --> 05:37:08,920
Yeah.

1738
05:37:08,920 --> 05:37:10,920
Are you guys going to be okay if I go, though?

1739
05:37:10,920 --> 05:37:12,920
I don't want to leave

1740
05:37:12,920 --> 05:37:14,920
I don't want to leave Upset.

1741
05:37:14,920 --> 05:37:16,920
I don't want to leave you

1742
05:37:16,920 --> 05:37:18,920
because we're both upset, you know?

1743
05:37:18,920 --> 05:37:20,920
Wait, so don't get

1744
05:37:20,920 --> 05:37:22,920
a scrawny in the Vivi Idol outfit come?

1745
05:37:22,920 --> 05:37:24,920
I don't know.

1746
05:37:24,920 --> 05:37:26,920
I think save your money on that one, chief.

1747
05:37:26,920 --> 05:37:28,920
I'm going to be honest. Actually, keep that money

1748
05:37:28,920 --> 05:37:30,920
to yourself and buy yourself a little chocolate

1749
05:37:30,920 --> 05:37:32,920
quat long or something with it instead

1750
05:37:32,920 --> 05:37:34,920
or a pan of chocolate. Sorry.

1751
05:37:34,920 --> 05:37:36,920
Chocolate quat long shit, pan of chocolate. Good.

1752
05:37:36,920 --> 05:37:38,920
Keep that money for yourself.

1753
05:37:38,920 --> 05:37:40,920
Don't get anything

1754
05:37:40,920 --> 05:37:42,920
Vivi inspired, I think I'll die.

1755
05:37:42,920 --> 05:37:44,920
We'll be alright.

1756
05:37:44,920 --> 05:37:46,920
Dude, you're gone, but we'll be okay.

1757
05:37:46,920 --> 05:37:48,920
Niichijo

1758
05:37:48,920 --> 05:37:50,920
is basically comedy made by

1759
05:37:50,920 --> 05:37:52,920
random things happening. I think mommy would like that.

1760
05:37:52,920 --> 05:37:54,920
Oh, more tears on the face

1761
05:37:54,920 --> 05:37:56,920
moments, you see?

1762
05:37:56,920 --> 05:37:58,920
Can we put some anime

1763
05:37:58,920 --> 05:38:00,920
recommendations on Marshmallow? Of course you can!

1764
05:38:00,920 --> 05:38:02,920
You're more than welcome to.

1765
05:38:02,920 --> 05:38:04,920
We have a maximum emotional exchange, don't sweat it.

1766
05:38:04,920 --> 05:38:06,920
We won't want to

1767
05:38:06,920 --> 05:38:08,920
tap you while you're drinking.

1768
05:38:10,920 --> 05:38:12,920
Make sure to hydrate well.

1769
05:38:12,920 --> 05:38:14,920
When you turn it into a dried squid

1770
05:38:14,920 --> 05:38:16,920
you know how you can buy dried squid in Japan?

1771
05:38:16,920 --> 05:38:18,920
I'm in one of those packets right now, I'm not dehydrated.

1772
05:38:22,920 --> 05:38:24,920
Have you seen Konosuba

1773
05:38:24,920 --> 05:38:26,920
mummy? Cause that's a fun one.

1774
05:38:26,920 --> 05:38:28,920
I've not seen Konosuba.

1775
05:38:28,920 --> 05:38:30,920
Konosuba is peak, is it?

1776
05:38:34,920 --> 05:38:36,920
Wah. Okay.

1777
05:38:36,920 --> 05:38:38,920
I'm going to go lie down

1778
05:38:38,920 --> 05:38:40,920
and cry and think about my emotions

1779
05:38:40,920 --> 05:38:42,920
and process what I've just consumed.

1780
05:38:42,920 --> 05:38:44,920
Yeah, next time

1781
05:38:44,920 --> 05:38:46,920
don't be surprised

1782
05:38:46,920 --> 05:38:48,920
if we watch something a bit more upbeat

1783
05:38:48,920 --> 05:38:50,920
cause I can't be handling these tears every two things.

1784
05:38:50,920 --> 05:38:52,920
Every movie I watch

1785
05:38:52,920 --> 05:38:54,920
I cry, every anime I watch I cry.

1786
05:38:54,920 --> 05:38:56,920
Well, cry the laughter on the first one.

1787
05:38:56,920 --> 05:38:58,920
That doesn't count, but yeah.

1788
05:39:00,920 --> 05:39:02,920
Don't forget to replenish

1789
05:39:02,920 --> 05:39:04,920
your salt, honestly.

1790
05:39:04,920 --> 05:39:06,920
How about

1791
05:39:06,920 --> 05:39:08,920
Strongie and the schoolgirl outfit?

1792
05:39:10,920 --> 05:39:12,920
And the archive?

1793
05:39:14,920 --> 05:39:16,920
I mean, I'm not going to tell you what to do with your money.

1794
05:39:16,920 --> 05:39:18,920
I see the schoolgirl outfit is better

1795
05:39:18,920 --> 05:39:20,920
I feel like I'm too emotionally distraught

1796
05:39:20,920 --> 05:39:22,920
to look at anything that resembles a movie for the next few days.

1797
05:39:26,920 --> 05:39:28,920
It's called 100 Girlfriends

1798
05:39:28,920 --> 05:39:30,920
that really, really love you. It's hilarious, wholesome, etchy

1799
05:39:30,920 --> 05:39:32,920
rom-com parody

1800
05:39:32,920 --> 05:39:34,920
with great visual humour.

1801
05:39:34,920 --> 05:39:36,920
Here's a little tip

1802
05:39:36,920 --> 05:39:38,920
for condolences.

1803
05:39:38,920 --> 05:39:40,920
Please rest well.

1804
05:39:40,920 --> 05:39:42,920
Thank you, MP bucket.

1805
05:39:44,920 --> 05:39:46,920
The Tropic Thunder.

1806
05:39:46,920 --> 05:39:48,920
I swear if I cry

1807
05:39:48,920 --> 05:39:50,920
that's supposed to be a comedy.

1808
05:39:50,920 --> 05:39:52,920
I've never seen

1809
05:39:52,920 --> 05:39:54,920
Tropic Thunder.

1810
05:39:54,920 --> 05:39:56,920
We love that you're a sensitive little bean.

1811
05:39:56,920 --> 05:39:58,920
Hold on a minute.

1812
05:39:58,920 --> 05:40:00,920
Don't talk about my sensitive bean like that.

1813
05:40:00,920 --> 05:40:02,920
I'm trying to give her happy tears.

1814
05:40:02,920 --> 05:40:04,920
Honestly.

1815
05:40:04,920 --> 05:40:06,920
There's plenty of laughs

1816
05:40:06,920 --> 05:40:08,920
in Tropic.

1817
05:40:08,920 --> 05:40:10,920
What's the agendination tomorrow?

1818
05:40:14,920 --> 05:40:16,920
The agendination tomorrow

1819
05:40:16,920 --> 05:40:18,920
is

1820
05:40:18,920 --> 05:40:20,920
a collab or castle crashers.

1821
05:40:20,920 --> 05:40:22,920
I've never played that before

1822
05:40:22,920 --> 05:40:24,920
so I'm going to have to play it offline.

1823
05:40:26,920 --> 05:40:28,920
I'll make a deal. I'll go for a nap

1824
05:40:28,920 --> 05:40:30,920
and then I'll play castle crashers to see what it's about

1825
05:40:30,920 --> 05:40:32,920
and then I'll do the collab

1826
05:40:32,920 --> 05:40:34,920
and then we'll do the member drawing history.

1827
05:40:34,920 --> 05:40:36,920
I'm still distraught though

1828
05:40:36,920 --> 05:40:38,920
just so you know I'm still distraught.

1829
05:40:40,920 --> 05:40:42,920
Everyone deploy the upbeat anime suggestions

1830
05:40:42,920 --> 05:40:44,920
honestly.

1831
05:40:44,920 --> 05:40:46,920
I'm like

1832
05:40:46,920 --> 05:40:48,920
I didn't expect to greet so hard

1833
05:40:48,920 --> 05:40:50,920
for the reeflings

1834
05:40:50,920 --> 05:40:52,920
that are into me crying. You're eating good in this one.

1835
05:40:52,920 --> 05:40:54,920
Your must be

1836
05:40:54,920 --> 05:40:56,920
full master in this entire expedition

1837
05:40:56,920 --> 05:40:58,920
that we went through.

1838
05:40:58,920 --> 05:41:00,920
Remember I hired her, yes.

1839
05:41:00,920 --> 05:41:02,920
I think

1840
05:41:02,920 --> 05:41:04,920
I deserve a good little nap

1841
05:41:04,920 --> 05:41:06,920
after this one.

1842
05:41:06,920 --> 05:41:08,920
I didn't expect this was a cute anime

1843
05:41:08,920 --> 05:41:10,920
that's got song mentions, a little bit of music

1844
05:41:10,920 --> 05:41:12,920
and then it's

1845
05:41:12,920 --> 05:41:14,920
you're cute when you cry

1846
05:41:14,920 --> 05:41:16,920
honestly.

1847
05:41:18,920 --> 05:41:20,920
Right.

1848
05:41:20,920 --> 05:41:22,920
My arse

1849
05:41:22,920 --> 05:41:24,920
is going to go.

1850
05:41:24,920 --> 05:41:26,920
I'm not going to redirect into anyone

1851
05:41:26,920 --> 05:41:28,920
because we're too emotionally distraught right now.

1852
05:41:28,920 --> 05:41:30,920
Are you going to be okay?

1853
05:41:30,920 --> 05:41:32,920
Is the real question

1854
05:41:32,920 --> 05:41:34,920
the part of the question

1855
05:41:36,920 --> 05:41:38,920
is what I'm wondering.

1856
05:41:40,920 --> 05:41:42,920
Crying equals

1857
05:41:42,920 --> 05:41:44,920
inking? I think some reeflings

1858
05:41:44,920 --> 05:41:46,920
like on a cry in a

1859
05:41:46,920 --> 05:41:48,920
factual way.

1860
05:41:48,920 --> 05:41:50,920
It gets them going.

1861
05:41:50,920 --> 05:41:52,920
Considering we don't have a policy yet,

1862
05:41:52,920 --> 05:41:54,920
I volunteer my body for a post crying

1863
05:41:54,920 --> 05:41:56,920
streaming session.

1864
05:41:56,920 --> 05:41:58,920
You put creaming sessions

1865
05:41:58,920 --> 05:42:00,920
to.

1866
05:42:00,920 --> 05:42:02,920
Big stretch.

1867
05:42:02,920 --> 05:42:04,920
Okay. How many episodes

1868
05:42:04,920 --> 05:42:06,920
of that? You're going to get 13 of the most

1869
05:42:06,920 --> 05:42:08,920
depressed and kisses I can offer.

1870
05:42:08,920 --> 05:42:10,920
One.

1871
05:42:10,920 --> 05:42:12,920
Two.

1872
05:42:12,920 --> 05:42:14,920
Three.

1873
05:42:14,920 --> 05:42:16,920
Four.

1874
05:42:16,920 --> 05:42:18,920
I'm going to have a nap.

1875
05:42:18,920 --> 05:42:20,920
I'll feel better after the nap.

1876
05:42:20,920 --> 05:42:22,920
Okay.

1877
05:42:22,920 --> 05:42:24,920
Five, six, seven, eight.

1878
05:42:24,920 --> 05:42:26,920
Three.

1879
05:42:26,920 --> 05:42:28,920
I sort of

1880
05:42:28,920 --> 05:42:30,920
pray.

1881
05:42:30,920 --> 05:42:32,920
Oh no, it's 13.

1882
05:42:32,920 --> 05:42:34,920
Was that five more?

1883
05:42:34,920 --> 05:42:36,920
One.

1884
05:42:36,920 --> 05:42:38,920
Nine.

1885
05:42:38,920 --> 05:42:40,920
10.

1886
05:42:40,920 --> 05:42:42,920
11.

1887
05:42:42,920 --> 05:42:44,920
12.

1888
05:42:44,920 --> 05:42:46,920
13.

1889
05:42:46,920 --> 05:42:48,920
Right.

1890
05:42:48,920 --> 05:42:50,920
I'll see you tomorrow.

1891
05:42:50,920 --> 05:42:52,920
I'll be bright-eyed and bushy-tailed.

1892
05:42:52,920 --> 05:42:54,920
Okay.

1893
05:42:54,920 --> 05:42:56,920
I'm sorry.

1894
05:42:56,920 --> 05:42:58,920
I was so short

1895
05:42:58,920 --> 05:43:00,920
for the post-yap

1896
05:43:00,920 --> 05:43:02,920
of the stream contents.

1897
05:43:02,920 --> 05:43:04,920
But as you can tell, I'm just a wee bit

1898
05:43:04,920 --> 05:43:06,920
distraught right now.

1899
05:43:06,920 --> 05:43:08,920
So we're going to be watching Hentai next

1900
05:43:08,920 --> 05:43:10,920
time.

1901
05:43:10,920 --> 05:43:12,920
We're all just going to be jerking off main.

1902
05:43:12,920 --> 05:43:14,920
I'll see you tomorrow.

1903
05:43:14,920 --> 05:43:16,920
I love you.

1904
05:43:16,920 --> 05:43:18,920
I'm sorry about wiping my snarl over your shirt.

1905
05:43:18,920 --> 05:43:20,920
Okay.

1906
05:43:20,920 --> 05:43:22,920
Bushy-tailed.

1907
05:43:22,920 --> 05:43:24,920
Right. I'll see you tomorrow.

1908
05:43:24,920 --> 05:43:26,920
Please enjoy yourselves. I'm so sorry.

1909
05:43:26,920 --> 05:43:28,920
Bye-bye.

1910
05:43:28,920 --> 05:43:30,920
Make sure to hydrate too.

1911
05:43:30,920 --> 05:43:32,920
See you tomorrow.

1912
05:43:34,920 --> 05:43:36,920
Kiki.
