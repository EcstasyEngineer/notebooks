1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Once the people in the camera

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Action!

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,000
You break the microphone on Discord every time you do that

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,000
It's like

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,000
It's like

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
What is that?

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
You're so sister everybody

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
That's awful

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
I don't know what a freaking voice is

10
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Awful

11
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Ebi's root?

12
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Ebi's root?

13
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,000
I'm checking

14
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,000
It's not

15
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
No, it takes like a minute to load for some reason

16
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
But once it's loaded

17
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,000
I'm being itched

18
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
No, it still considers streaming

19
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Like when someone looks back in the VOD

20
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
They'll still be able to see this

21
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Shit

22
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
So don't say anything

23
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Don't say anything weird

24
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Okay, okay

25
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Okay, there they are

26
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Hi Reflings

27
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Hi

28
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
And Implings

29
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
If you're out there together today

30
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
You make Implings

31
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Good morning, good evening, good afternoon

32
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I'm Strongly Calls

33
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
And I'm joined by none other than

34
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Ten sister Yakunts

35
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Oh no, not Seepo

36
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Hello, alloy to both gifts

37
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Mambochka here, hello, hello

38
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I have the streamer who never streams

39
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Because I left streaming to become a strongy

40
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Full-time strongy fan boy

41
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
She's a full-time clipper of me, thank you

42
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Full-time clipper

43
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Get the subs

44
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Get the subs

45
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Get the subs

46
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Stop it

47
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
No, stop

48
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Strongly Farted In My Ear Before She

49
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
No, I didn't

50
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Did you hear it?

51
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Right

52
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
At about time

53
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
You got paid back

54
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Because you exposed me for my dirty chair

55
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Okay

56
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
You're getting exposed for farting in my ear

57
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Before she was away

58
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
I just farted in the mic

59
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Before we hit Gola

60
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
She apologized

61
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
She had the audacity to apologize

62
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
I was like

63
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Have a wee whiff in a sniff

64
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
And why don't you

65
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Right, so

66
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
We are playing a game mode

67
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Called

68
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
2vs

69
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Stop

70
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Stuff in the background

71
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
There's a temporary game mode

72
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
In Dead by Daily

73
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
It runs for two more days

74
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
If that's your thing

75
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
It is two killers

76
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Versus eight survivors

77
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
The perks are already decided

78
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
The killers are limited

79
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
So if me and Sin want to pick a different killer

80
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
It's not a big deal

81
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Hello, Momay and Mambochka

82
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Real and true

83
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Mambochka

84
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Do you need a lesson?

85
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
It's Mambochka

86
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Mambochka

87
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Mambochka

88
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Mambochka

89
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
As you can see

90
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
I am a faker

91
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
There's a way

92
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
There's a way

93
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
There's a way

94
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
There's a way more

95
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Sin

96
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Myself and Sin

97
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Have quite a lot of history

98
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
And I'm going to finally tell you the story

99
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Before we go into a game

100
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Just so we can

101
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
We can tell you the story

102
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Of how me and Sin became friends

103
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Long story

104
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Oh my God

105
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Sorry

106
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
I know you're not streaming Sin

107
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
But I literally just got 50 gifted memberships

108
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Literally big Jeff coming in

109
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
With 50 gifted memberships

110
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Thank you L. Jeff

111
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
For the most cursed mobile picture ever

112
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Congrats to those who caught it with your face

113
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
But thank you so much

114
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Big 50 bomb name

115
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Done anything

116
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
A lot of people want to know

117
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
How the heck did me and Sin become friends

118
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
If I told you

119
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
That me and Sin were rivals

120
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Would you believe me?

121
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
If we were rivals

122
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Would you believe me?

123
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Cause that's true

124
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Okay

125
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
So long story short

126
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Back in the old college outie days

127
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
There was this girl

128
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Ruining my win streaks

129
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
There was none other than Sin

130
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
So I hated her guts

131
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
I knew it was a girl

132
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Because in voice chat

133
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Like when you get a killer

134
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Like at the end of rounds

135
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
And S&D in particular

136
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Literally

137
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Like she would

138
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
You know say stuff down the mic

139
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
And I'd be like

140
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
You fucking slag

141
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
And she'd be like

142
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
You slag

143
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
But she

144
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
She'd be like

145
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
You got no arms

146
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
No arms

147
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
No legs

148
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
And a pillowcase

149
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
There we go

150
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
So we were rivals

151
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
I hated her

152
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
And we would play the same game every day

153
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
And we would

154
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Freaking get into each other's lobbies

155
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
All the time

156
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
And then eventually

157
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
A truce was formed

158
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Do you want to know what the truce was?

159
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
It was

160
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Look

161
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
We both have a high win record

162
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Will we go win

163
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Some games together

164
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
That was the truce

165
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
It was for the win-loss

166
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
And then we became acquaintances

167
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Then we became whores

168
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
I said it on you've skipped a few years

169
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,000
So then we became acquaintances

170
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
And we would play games together

171
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
And as often

172
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Love prevails

173
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
I didn't shag her

174
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Relax

175
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
But

176
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Basically

177
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
As you play with anyone

178
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
You form a friendship

179
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
And then lo and behold

180
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Many a years later

181
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
We both beat you first

182
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Oh

183
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
To the sun

184
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
To the sun

185
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Oh yes

186
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
So literally

187
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Now we're enemies to friends

188
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
I've literally met her mum

189
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
That is how fantastic

190
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Maui, mami

191
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Maui, mami

192
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Hadwi, mami

193
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Hadmabi, mami

194
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Yes

195
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
So

196
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
That is the

197
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Bizarre adventures

198
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Of Strawni and Sin

199
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Please tune in next time

200
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
For a secret behind the scenes

201
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Lore, if you like

202
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
But

203
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
I am going to throw us in a game

204
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Because I don't know how long it's going to take

205
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
So if you'd like to

206
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
I'm not ready

207
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Are you ready?

208
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Are you ready though?

209
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
You don't pick anything in game

210
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
All the perks

211
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Are you joking?

212
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
What's going on?

213
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
All the perks are locked in

214
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
You can only pick between the killers you paid for

215
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
I was just wondering if you're ready though

216
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Oh no, no, no

217
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
It's all by default

218
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
But

219
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Okay

220
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
That is literally

221
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
An in real life friend

222
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
I'm jealous

223
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
I've literally touched hands with Sin

224
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Did you not know?

225
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Touched hands

226
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
We've touched hands

227
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
We had a sleepover

228
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Yeah, we've looked in each other's eyeballs

229
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Oh man

230
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Oh, we did

231
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
We did

232
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Oh, actually, Amala would say this

233
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Amala would say this

234
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Wait, type what it is

235
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
What is it?

236
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Amala type it

237
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Go on then

238
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
You're making me nervous

239
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
She's going to laugh

240
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Oh, she's typing

241
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
She's click, click, click

242
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
There we go

243
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Amala would say that

244
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
What the fuck?

245
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Amala would say it

246
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Is that true?

247
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Are you joking?

248
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Yeah, it's real

249
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
It's true

250
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Are you a direct show?

251
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
You do

252
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Amala would say it

253
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
What it is

254
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Well, if it's true, then you need to fucking tell

255
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
You must be getting fucking tell

256
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,000
10 years later, practically, I'm only finding this out now

257
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Sin has really bad eye contact

258
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
She's terrible eye contact

259
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Terrible eye contact

260
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,000
She really struggles to look me in the eyes

261
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Look

262
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
She just can't even look me in the eyes

263
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
She'll look everywhere else

264
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
She'll look at my hair

265
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
She'll look at my nose

266
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
She'll look at my lips

267
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
When I'm talking

268
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
She'll look around the room

269
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
She'll look at my strontism herself

270
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Coming from strontism

271
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
You have to practice eye contact

272
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
You literally have to pick an eyeball

273
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
And then every, like, roughly 10 seconds

274
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Look away, break for 2 seconds

275
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
And come back

276
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
That's how you do it

277
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
That's how it's done, okay

278
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
You leave me and Mali eyeballs alone

279
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
I know, but

280
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
You leave my eyeballs alone

281
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
It's endearing

282
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
It's cute, Ellie

283
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Yeah, I like it

284
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Oh, for fuck's sake

285
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Even my frickin' feature book

286
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
I'm looking in the right direction

287
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
I'm raging

288
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
I'm pure for you, men

289
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
I'm for you, men

290
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Absolutely for you, men

291
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Well, can I use some practice, then?

292
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
A wee bit of practice

293
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
You need to practice on the ips

294
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Oh, yeah

295
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Oh, my god

296
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Staring into the basement

297
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
I'll make you a hypnotist like me

298
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Because you need eye contact to be a hypnotist

299
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
I mean, getting like

300
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
I've just broken all my tools

301
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Oh, my god, you do know

302
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
When I actually go out in public now

303
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
I'm going to be pure paranoid

304
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
But my eyes are

305
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
No

306
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
That's all that's going to be going

307
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
That's all that's going to be going through my head now

308
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Oh, my god

309
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
My eyes

310
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
My contact

311
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
My contact

312
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
No, to self

313
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Don't leave the hoose again

314
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
No, that's not what I'm saying

315
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
See what she's probably did to me, guys

316
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
No

317
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Oh, my god, they're all posting eyeballs in chat

318
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
That's hilarious

319
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Is that my practice?

320
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Okay, I'll try

321
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
I'll try

322
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
I'll get the whole contact

323
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
I'll contact with your chat

324
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Okay, I'm staring at the chat

325
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
She sees you're making

326
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
I'm watching you

327
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
I know people are going to be confused

328
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Like, guys, okay

329
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
I'm half Russian

330
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
I grew up in Scotland

331
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Okay, that's why I go Scottish

332
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
When I hear scrawny

333
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Yes

334
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Okay, I soap up the accent

335
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
That's funny though

336
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
I left Russia a few years ago

337
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
And because we're doing the chair thing

338
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Sorry about that

339
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Okay, so when I was like leaving Russia

340
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
I had this office chair

341
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
That I used for gaming

342
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,000
That I accumulated a lot of my postures, right?

343
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Like, because of my vaginal pH

344
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
It was pure white

345
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
And I used to be stitched to it, right?

346
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Because I've been using it for years

347
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Like, you know, you farted in that chair

348
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
You leaked in that chair

349
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Because, let's be honest

350
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Most VTubers game of me pants on

351
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
And then I took

352
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
I had to wait until 1am

353
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
To take my chair out into the streets

354
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Because in Russia

355
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
You don't have your own bins and shit

356
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
So I had to

357
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Everyone in the street shares a dumpster

358
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
So I had to wait until 1am

359
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Until everyone was sleeping

360
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
To roll the chair

361
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
And then I was like

362
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Okay, no one caught me

363
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Thank fuck

364
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
I went in

365
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
I went to go to the shop the next morning

366
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
There's a gypsy's rolling in the street

367
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Stealing my postures chair

368
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
I was mortified

369
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Because I was like that meme

370
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Where the guys in the corner

371
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Like, they don't know that

372
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
They don't know that's my postures chair

373
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Oh my god

374
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
I was mortified

375
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
I was like, oh my god

376
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
And I've also thought that was rude

377
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Because it's like

378
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
The imps could have had that chair

379
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Why are these random folks

380
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Stealing my chair

381
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
They've yanked it

382
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
They could have cloned you

383
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
They yanked my chair

384
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
They yanked anything they can find

385
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
In the bins

386
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
And unfortunately it was my postures chair

387
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
So I was like that

388
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Because that just amazed me

389
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
I was like, they gave her a chair today

390
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Because like, they gave her a chair thing

391
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Right, so what we were going to do

392
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
We were

393
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
I suppose Stony's got

394
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Her fucking time in the month today, right?

395
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa

396
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
I don't tell them

397
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
My tummy hurts

398
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
I don't tell

399
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
My tummy hurts

400
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
I don't tell the reports that

401
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Sorry, that's payback

402
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
You sent back my eyeballs

403
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Right

404
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Stony's leaking red

405
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Stony's got the red rivers of blood

406
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Red rivers of blood

407
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Note it in the calendars, boys

408
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Note it on the calendars

409
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Keep track in our most fair-tile weeks, alright?

410
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,000
I don't tell them my hymen time

411
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Because I'm thinking

412
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
I don't tell people

413
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
I can't even cry

414
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Okay, okay, okay

415
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Okay, right

416
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Fuckin' 1v1 the unnec-time right now

417
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
I think

418
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
I think we're gonna

419
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,000
I think we're gonna have to look for a lobby

420
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Because I don't know if you guys

421
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Do we have to be survivors of this?

422
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
I think so

423
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
We're gonna have to cancel

424
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
I'll get us another

425
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
I'll get us another

426
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Just like how you're canceled in a

427
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Leader

428
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
You're can-cancellated

429
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
I'm gonna fucking cancel

430
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
No sudden black ops to this

431
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
There will be blood

432
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Either way, there's gonna be blood in this game

433
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
This stream, sorry

434
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Yeah, so it's only one of us

435
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
With her clam on the-

436
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
With her clam hat

437
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Stop! She's got-

438
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Bruh, I'm being fucking ringed out

439
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,000
I've never been more exposed in my life right now

440
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
What the heck?

441
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Same

442
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Same

443
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Oh my god, I'm so-

444
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
That's two things

445
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
You called me out from my chair

446
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
And my eyeballs

447
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Okay, we're not equal yet

448
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
I need one more thing

449
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Oh my god

450
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
I thought I'd die

451
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
I'm like, uh

452
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
I don't even know what else you can make fun of me for

453
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
My flat chest

454
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:20,000
You're welcome, refund your welcome

455
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Literally, now you know my fair-tile window as well

456
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Rip enemies to lovers that enemies get

457
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Yeah, I've done both the flow app

458
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
The flow app is really good

459
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
So get Strawny's date put right in

460
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Don't

461
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Which started today on the flow app

462
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
I've got that

463
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Is that why you're both bloody?

464
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Stop it

465
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Stop it, bitch

466
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Tisker

467
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Don't tisker that

468
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
How dare you

469
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Right, is there literally no one playing this game?

470
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
I think we're actually gonna have to do a regular

471
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Schmeigler to Survivor Lobby

472
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
This is awful

473
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:50,000
I know, I actually saw maybe earlier that

474
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
People are struggling to find lobbies

475
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Okay, right

476
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Well, just a regular Schmeigler

477
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Oh, no, I don't want to go to the store for you

478
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Hold on

479
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,000
I've already paid a base fee to get on your game

480
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
I'll pay, I'll pass, okay

481
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Right, play as a Survivor

482
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
And then invade

483
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
You're welcome, sweetie

484
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
There's a momma, she's always here to help

485
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Let's just get the fuck out of here

486
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Um

487
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Senni's playing on another League Mummy

488
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
You should respond

489
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,000
I'm not dogging on Senn, what the fuck

490
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
I mean, I already dogged on her

491
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Wait, who's dogging?

492
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Because you were going on about my hymen

493
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
That hymen was after

494
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Afterports, alright

495
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Okay

496
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Annihilate

497
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
What is Tisker?

498
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:35,000
So, in TSKR means Tascaru

499
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Which means like, I'm blessed I needed that, etc

500
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,000
But because I was such a noobie noobie boobie

501
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
To VTubing, I was like

502
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
What's Tisker, guys?

503
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
But it's Tascaru

504
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Oh, it is what it is

505
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
So it just means like, thanks

506
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,000
So that's why we say it as Tisker here

507
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Mummy is getting defeated

508
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Bro, I asked the where, I've got my Pepsi

509
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
If we actually cannot find a match

510
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
I'm gonna cry

511
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,000
There's no way there's no one else playing this game right now

512
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
The one time I wanna stream on it

513
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
And there's not one

514
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
What the heck is this?

515
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
I might have to get

516
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Oh, alright, we've done it

517
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Oh, I was about to say to me to get a pub background

518
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
I'm gonna need to have a fucking

519
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Just chatting shit

520
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
About each other for a two hour stream

521
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
I remember that time

522
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Oh my god, I have no perks

523
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
I have no perks

524
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Wait, how does this game work?

525
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Oh my god, how does this game work again?

526
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Oh, look

527
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Oh, I'm Meg, I'm Meg

528
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Alright

529
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
It's been a hot minute

530
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
I have terrible news

531
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
I literally have no perks

532
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
So you're on your own

533
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
If I get downed you're legit

534
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
It's over

535
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
I'm so sorry

536
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
But we're literally gonna have to get carried by these two people

537
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Because it's not gonna be me that's getting carried

538
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
But they look dripped up

539
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:46,000
So I think I have faith we can get carried this game

540
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
They look ripped

541
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
We're in our little default outfit

542
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
I'm a little bit too much

543
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
It's been so long I played this game

544
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Some was like

545
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
You should play Chucky for more immersion

546
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
And I was like, eh

547
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Chucky bastard

548
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Wait, because you're small

549
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
I'm like, yeah, shock and behaviour

550
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
See, I should be Chucky for an immersion

551
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Since it's quite a little bit smaller than me

552
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Yeah, well, that's true

553
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
I can't even argue it

554
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
That's true, yeah

555
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Yeah, it's actually really cute

556
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Sorry, but it's really cute

557
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
I don't know why I don't

558
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Like, you don't invite your friends

559
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
You're like, I'm no small, are you?

560
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
That kind of thing

561
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Like, nah, she's small

562
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
But it's cute

563
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
I like it's endearing

564
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Like, I'm taller than my mom

565
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Okay, you leave me alone

566
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Okay

567
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
That's all you need to do

568
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
I'm taller than my mom

569
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
You need to be taller than this

570
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Oh shit

571
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Are you already under attack?

572
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
I heard it's hard to be

573
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Oh my, oh my God

574
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
My accent's changing

575
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Wait, hold on

576
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
I'll do the rush on that now

577
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
Hello, how are you?

578
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
My pronunciation

579
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
What are you talking about?

580
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
You're speaking Russian

581
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
I don't understand

582
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Well done

583
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Well done

584
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Well done

585
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Come on, come on

586
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Well done

587
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Come on, come on

588
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
So since sister's pocket size

589
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Literally, I'm putting her on a lollipop

590
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
I'm getting a lollipop version

591
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Of since sister right now

592
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
I'm paying for it, I don't care

593
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
I want to see it

594
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Oh my God

595
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Oh my God, imagine your boob toggle

596
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
And a lollipop, sorry

597
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
But you would destroy the feature

598
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Oh my God, do you know how many spines

599
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
I need to hold myself up by the way

600
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Because my model's like real height of me

601
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Can you imagine

602
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
My tits, literally

603
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
With these size of tits

604
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
My nips are getting scalps

605
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
From the floorboards

606
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
I'm dragging along

607
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Because how can my midget ass

608
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Hold up these bags of milk

609
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
I don't know

610
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Oh my God

611
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Literally

612
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Talking

613
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
I don't know

614
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
You don't get it

615
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
I didn't forget you

616
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
I'm on a gen

617
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Right now

618
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
There's someone else that's

619
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
On the hook right now

620
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Oh, blyat hamukha

621
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Bitch

622
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
I just get to watch from

623
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
What you want

624
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
My safety

625
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Oh, bozhe

626
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Oh my God, he's trying to find me

627
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Oh my God

628
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Oh

629
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Ah, get fucked

630
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Ah, you go the other way

631
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Oh shit, he's back

632
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
Oh my God

633
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Okay, so wait

634
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
I'm gonna start a gen

635
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Someone's getting the save, at least

636
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
That looks like

637
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
Okay, I totally did a gen

638
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
Because I'm such a good

639
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
You're such a good little mummy

640
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Aren't you?

641
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,000
You're a good mummy

642
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
I'm not protecting my young

643
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Where is the killer?

644
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Oh, they're getting absolutely shredded

645
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Right, they got saved

646
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Sorry, not my problem

647
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Shit

648
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Oh, fuck, I just blew it up

649
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Oh, it's a chainsaw

650
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
No

651
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
Yeah, I haven't seen him in so long

652
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Oh no, our teammates are a little worm now

653
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Oh no

654
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
A little wormy

655
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,000
A little wiggly worm

656
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Oh my God, wait

657
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Two people have already been on the hook

658
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
Sorry, we're not getting out of here alive

659
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
I'm so sorry

660
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
We're not making it out alive

661
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Looks like an actual red

662
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,000
We're not getting out of here

663
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Are we even gonna win a game

664
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Before the end of the stream?

665
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
I don't know

666
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Would you still love me soon

667
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
If I was a worm beach of her?

668
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Oh my God

669
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,000
I'll make a fucking crib for you

670
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
I'll get some dirt, some plants

671
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Oh

672
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
You can live your life out in a sandwich tub

673
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Oh my God, I love

674
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
Oh my God, can I get orange peels as well

675
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,000
While you're at it

676
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Oh my God, yeah

677
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
Yeah, every night

678
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Every night, I mean

679
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Fuck, where am I going with that sentence?

680
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
I'll give you some playtime outside for you

681
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Oh, yeah

682
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
Oh, he's come back to the

683
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Oh no, I just got

684
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,000
I just got

685
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
I was freaking

686
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,000
I was like

687
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Fuck

688
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,000
I'm gonna be so smart

689
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,000
And hide in this locker

690
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
The first thing the killer does

691
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Opens the locker

692
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Bruh

693
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
You couldn't

694
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,000
That is

695
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
You couldn't make that up

696
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
You honestly couldn't make that up

697
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,000
No way

698
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Our teammate's down

699
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,000
We are

700
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,000
We're not making out alive

701
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,000
Yeah

702
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,000
We ain't doing that

703
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,000
He here

704
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,000
The locker was too close

705
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,000
It's already closed

706
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
I don't know

707
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
I feel like it's so far away

708
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
Trust and mummy actually never mind

709
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
You know what?

710
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,000
You're in trouble

711
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Fuck, she was

712
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,000
She was slick

713
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Literally

714
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,000
Mamuchka, mamuchka

715
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,000
It's me

716
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
How do you say help me?

717
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Mamuchka

718
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,000
How do you say help me?

719
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,000
Abagibia

720
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,000
Abagibia

721
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,000
Abagibia

722
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,000
Abagibia

723
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Abagiciu

724
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,000
I'm sorry

725
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,000
Yeah, I do

726
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Yeah, I do

727
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000

I'm safe

730
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Run!

731
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Run!

732
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Run!

733
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
Where are you, bitch?

734
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,000
He's chasing me

735
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
No, I'm just glad she's having fun

736
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,000
Oh my God

737
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,000
Oh my God

738
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,000
I need to stop

739
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,000
Oh my God

740
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,000
She's getting chastened

741
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,000
Oh my God

742
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
My med kit literally doesn't have enough to heal me

743
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,000
You have to be kidding

744
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
I should have put self-care on

745
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
This is fucking PSDS

746
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,000
Oh my God

747
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,000
Oh shit, they changed

748
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
They've changed the struggle thing

749
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Hen, I don't even know if I can come save you

750
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,000
I'm literally doing it

751
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Don't even bother

752
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,000
Find that fucking hatch

753
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
We're not making it

754
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,000
It's not even unlocked

755
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000
The hatch hasn't unlocked

756
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
You need two generators done

757
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,000
Oh yeah, I need to die first

758
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000
Fuck

759
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
Well, just let me die

760
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,000
Oh my God, no

761
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Oh my God, sorry

762
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
I need to save you

763
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,000
Oh my God, we're all worms

764
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,000
I'm coming soon

765
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Oh my God, worm v-tubers are real

766
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,000
I'm coming

767
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,000
I'm coming

768
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,000
I'm saving

769
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,000
I'm ready to run

770
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,000
I'm ready to run

771
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,000
You need to go

772
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,000
You need to go on

773
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,000
Oh fuck, he's going to like

774
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,000
literally chain saw over

775
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,000
Yeah, relax

776
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,000
I'm going to switch off this hook

777
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Oh my God

778
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,000
Oh my God

779
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,000
Oh my God, we aren't going to make it

780
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,000
Run

781
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,000
I'm fucking running

782
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,000
I need to get that gen done for you

783
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,000
So you can escape

784
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,000
Oh my God

785
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,000
Oh shit

786
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,000
I hear a heartbeat

787
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,000
I think so

788
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,000
Oh no, he's doing that weird move

789
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
where he like swings left and right

790
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,000
I don't know what if

791
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,000
I'm taking him away

792
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,000
I'm sorry, I'm taking him away

793
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,000
I'm taking him away

794
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
I'm taking him halfway across the map

795
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,000
Okay, I don't know how to get you

796
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,000
Oh

797
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,000
I don't know how to

798
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,000
Oh no, I'm walking into you

799
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,000
Shit

800
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,000
All right, I'm going the other way

801
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,000
I'm going the other way

802
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
All right, it's fine

803
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
I was actually walking into you

804
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,000
He's waving at all times

805
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,000
Right

806
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,000
Oh my God

807
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,000
I don't even think the

808
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
things unlocked for you

809
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,000
Unless you've changed it

810
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,000
Right, I'm just going to die

811
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
and pray that it's going to open for you

812
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,000
I'm just going to pray

813
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,000
I think I'm bleeding out

814
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,000
I think I'm mourning

815
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,000
Oh my God, I'm mourning

816
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
I'm trying to die as fast as I can

817
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,000
How could his heartbeat already

818
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,000
I don't know

819
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,000
Maybe he has a pair

820
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,000
This map is awful

821
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,000
Literally the first game

822
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,000
we got one gen done

823
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,000
That's not looking good

824
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,000
I'm just going to heal myself

825
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,000
Right, I've perished

826
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
I don't know if the hatch opens up or not

827
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,000
Please

828
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,000
It's any death by day

829
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,000
like frozen here

830
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
I've been taken up to the entity

831
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,000
The heart

832
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,000
I think you saw me

833
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,000
It appears as soon as

834
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
there's only one person left alive

835
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,000
They might have changed it

836
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,000
Hold on, I'm going to spectator

837
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,000
You fucking found me

838
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,000
Spectator

839
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,000
Just run, don't look behind

840
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,000
Run, one more hit

841
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,000
and I'm down

842
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,000
Where's the pallet?

843
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,000
I don't know

844
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,000
Oh no

845
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,000
Bro

846
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,000
No

847
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,000
He's doing a goofy laugh

848
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,000
It's really scary

849
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,000
Oh no

850
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,000
I don't like it

851
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,000
Oh my God

852
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,000
Well

853
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,000
I don't

854
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,000
Well, he's won, so

855
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,000
Yeah

856
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,000
Last set GG

857
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,000
Absolutely

858
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,000
GG, that was the worst GG

859
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,000
We barely had a chance

860
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,000
Bro

861
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
He has to be feeling good about himself

862
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
Oh, I'm slurping my breath in like that

863
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
Must be stabbed in the abdomen

864
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,000
A little but fucking

865
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
rolled in smoke for any reason

866
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,000
Wait, what was this pair?

867
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,000
Great start

868
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,000
I know

869
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
If that's going to be the mood of this club

870
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,000
it's not looking good

871
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,000
I know it's going downhill

872
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,000
We're on a downward

873
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,000
Sorry, I'm going to be a weirdo

874
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,000
What was this pair?

875
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,000
Unlocks potential

876
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:44,000
Any survivor performing a brush action?

877
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
Oh, everything is like

878
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,000
What's surge?

879
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,000
Putting a survivor in a dying state

880
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
with a basic attack

881
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
All gens explode, bro

882
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,000
We never even did anything

883
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
Iron Maiden, you open lockers

884
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,000
50% faster, bro

885
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
I'm too much of a noob to understand this

886
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,000
Sorry, it's been far too long

887
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,000
It's been far too long

888
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,000
Yeah, I can't read

889
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,000
But then again

890
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,000
Girls are made for seeding

891
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,000
not for reading

892
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,000
So who cares?

893
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,000
Anyway

894
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,000
If that's your interview, you're in

895
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,000
I'm in

896
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,000
I'm in

897
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,000
Right, okay, let me try

898
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
Call me Fondle a bosom

899
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,000
Stop

900
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,000
I thought that was amazing

901
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,000
Sorry, I thought so

902
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,000
I thought it was though

903
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,000
It just made sense

904
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,000
Fondle, that's because

905
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,000
Fond, like a goat

906
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,000
Right, Fondle

907
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,000
Fondle my bosom

908
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,000
It just makes sense

909
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,000
You're shocking me, bro

910
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,000
In short, his perks

911
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,000
Someone says if you fart

912
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
he knows exactly where you did it

913
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,000
Bro

914
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,000
Right, I'm levelling up my perks

915
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
Oh my God, I'm going to be so MLG for this

916
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,000
Oh my God

917
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,000
I'm level 10

918
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,000
I've got two slots unlocked

919
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,000
Oh my God, I've got an achievement for that

920
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,000
I'm such a real gamer

921
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,000
Oh

922
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,000
It's just

923
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,000
Oh my God, the entity's stealing from me

924
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,000
Sorry, but that's theft

925
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,000
Don't do that

926
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,000
What's going on?

927
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
Wait, wait, what do you mean the entity's stealing from me?

928
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
It, like, joined the weak spot from me

929
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
And when I was unlocking the blood web

930
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
I'm currently spamming all my blood points right now

931
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
Into the blood web

932
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
And it freaking stole from me

933
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,000
Can we fight that?

934
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,000
We bastard the entity

935
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
Literally, who does he think he is?

936
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight

937
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,000
I've got, oh my God

938
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,000
Oh yeah, yeah

939
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,000
I've got another achievement

940
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,000
I'm not even doing anything

941
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,000
I'm just buying stuff

942
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,000
I need to burp, but

943
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,000
Stronny's burps are another breed

944
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,000
and I'm scared because it's like

945
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,000
my burp's just a little bit

946
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
She's worried about being outburped by me

947
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,000
I'm literally holding it in

948
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
I'm like, I can't burp on Stronny's stream

949
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,000
because it's hurting me

950
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,000
No, you should

951
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,000
Reflins, no, your burps are

952
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
absolutely insane

953
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
You should be in the Olympics, those burps

954
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:38,000
I'm waiting for the first burp compilation

955
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,000
to go up

956
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,000
and if it doesn't go up in a month

957
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
I'm actually making my own burp compilation

958
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,000
because

959
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:46,000
there's a reflin that clips all my good burps

960
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,000
and I'm like, thank you very much

961
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,000
free content for me

962
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,000
thank you

963
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,000
because I will literally make a short

964
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,000
of just all my burps

965
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
and then I'll be known as the burptuber

966
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,000
thank you very much

967
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
Gather up, gather up

968
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,000
Hear that, hear that

969
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
Any burp compilation experts in the chat

970
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,000
you know what to do

971
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
Get Stronny Vegas bootied up

972
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
Once on our desk by 9 o'clock tomorrow

973
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
Actually, speaking of clips

974
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,000
in the Clipper program

975
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,000
I'm working on it

976
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
for any reflin that's getting edged

977
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,000
in their seat when I keep saying

978
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,000
it's about to launch

979
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:19,000
My goal after this stream

980
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,000
I'm doing a membership stream

981
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,000
of ASMR

982
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
and then after that

983
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
I'm legitimately

984
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
getting that program launched

985
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,000
sorry, but you're all getting paid

986
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,000
to clip us

987
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,000
and you're just going to have to accept it

988
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
you're just going to have to take my whole money

989
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,000
you just are

990
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,000
so, yeah

991
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,000
we've come full circle

992
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,000
you're now

993
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000
you're being forced to work for hoes

994
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,000
that's terrible

995
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,000
if you say it like that

996
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,000
oh my god

997
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,000
I'm pimping you out

998
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,000
why?

999
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,000
I'll get the entity

1000
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,000
okay, I'm level 21

1001
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,000
we sweat

1002
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,000
level 21

1003
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,000
wait, what level am I?

1004
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,000
I might level three

1005
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,000
I'm trying to like get

1006
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
my freaking perks to be better

1007
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,000
I've got spine chill

1008
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,000
so I know when the killer looks at me

1009
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,000
self-care, empathy

1010
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,000
I can see when someone's injured

1011
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,000
that's kind of shit to be honest

1012
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,000
I guess it tells me where the killer is

1013
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,000
so I can just keep doing my thing

1014
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,000
I'm sorry, that guy

1015
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,000
like, no

1016
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,000
I could never escape from that guy's heartbeat

1017
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,000
everywhere

1018
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,000
in my ear

1019
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,000
I'm like, what the fuck

1020
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,000
I'm sure there was a parrot called

1021
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,000
agitation or something

1022
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,000
that makes your heartbeat louder

1023
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,000
artificially

1024
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,000
I don't know, maybe not that

1025
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,000
ooh

1026
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,000
I'm so glad I have this slippery meat

1027
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,000
parrot

1028
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
the parrot that I will literally never use

1029
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,000
I'm sure you reeflings don't mind having

1030
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,000
a bit of slippery meat

1031
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,000
here we go again

1032
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,000
and we actually bet it's true though

1033
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,000
why do your own work

1034
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,000
when you've got like

1035
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,000
reeflings to do the work for you

1036
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,000
you know

1037
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,000
why get randoms

1038
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,000
why pay randoms

1039
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,000
you know

1040
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,000
the viewers are here

1041
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,000
off you fall

1042
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,000
reeflings take the money

1043
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,000
take the money

1044
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,000
take the money

1045
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
magic and paid by your whole

1046
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,000
to do work

1047
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,000
like to clip her farting

1048
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,000
like

1049
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,000
isn't that just such an amazing deal

1050
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,000
oh my god

1051
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,000

1052
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,000

1053
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,000
and I need to get it clipped

1054
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,000
I've been

1055
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,000
I've literally told the girls

1056
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,000
I was like

1057
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,000

00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,000

for some reason

1064
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,000
they always artificially

1065
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,000
get really popular

1066
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,000
and you

1067
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,000
want no proof of that

1068
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,000
Emmy has a fart clip out

1069
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,000
and everyone was like

1070
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,000
oh my god

1071
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,000
this is the best clip ever

1072
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,000
in the comments

1073
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,000
I'm like yeah

1074
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,000

00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,000
I'm on to you fart andies

1076
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,000
I'm on to you

1077
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,000
right inside your gossip

1078
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,000
I was like

1079
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,000
totally like

1080
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,000
in the interview

1081
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,000
and she was like

1082
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,000
if you can't burp and fart

1083
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,000
loud in this decibel

1084
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,000
then you're not in

1085
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,000
and that's how

1086
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,000
she was like

1087
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,000
oh she's exposed to truth

1088
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,000
you're sacked

1089
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,000
so

1090
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,000
oh my god

1091
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,000
the truth has revealed us

1092
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,000
that's actually what happened guys

1093
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,000
so

1094
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,000
yeah we were

1095
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,000
we were in a voice call

1096
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,000
and wasn't satisfied

1097
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,000
with her interview stage

1098
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,000
because she said

1099
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,000
she wasn't willing to fart

1100
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,000
down the three deal

1101
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,000
that was it

1102
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,000
I was in just in

1106
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,000

1107
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,000

1108
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,000

1110
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,000
should amazer sign an NDA

1111
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,000
should amazer sign an NDA

1112
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,000
should amazer sign an NDA

1113
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
your saints can't have you in

1114
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,000
can't have you in

1115
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,000
sorry if you're not willing

1116
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,000
to fart through a walkie-talkie

1117
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,000
and

1118
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,000
ASMR art it imps

1119
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,000
stop

1120
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,000
that's actually a really funny

1121
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,000
concept of a name

1122
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,000
if we get something

1123
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,000
that can we still

1124
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,000
farting down the mic

1125
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,000
I might just call her

1126
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,000
an ASMR forest

1127
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,000
because that's amazing

1128
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,000
that's actually amazing

1129
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,000
we're in saw

1130
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,000
I fucking hate this man

1131
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,000
we're all together though

1132
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,000
right where's the gin

1133
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,000
that makes it even worse

1134
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:31,000
I hate when we're all together

1135
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,000
ASMR conness one

1136
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,000
okay

1137
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,000
I've got a fart pin saving me

1138
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,000
but I'm too embarrassed

1139
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,000
everyone's just going to point

1140
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,000
and laugh at me

1141
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,000
I'm just sitting in my throat

1142
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,000
I'm not gonna judge

1143
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,000
I can't

1144
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,000
I can't

1145
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,000

1148
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,000

00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,000

00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,000
I don't know what to do

1163
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:08,000
against this killer

1164
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,000

1166
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,000

1167
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,000
I don't know

1168
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,000

1169
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,000

1177
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,000

1178
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,000

1179
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,000

1180
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,000

1181
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,000

00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,000

1184
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,000
she's like

1185
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,000
the teleporting one

1186
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,000

1187
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,000
teleport away

1188
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,000
oh not a teleporting

1189
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,000

1191
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,000
her bones crack

1192
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,000
and shit

1193
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,000
while she's teleporting

1194
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,000
her lore

1195
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,000
was that

1196
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,000
her dad

1197
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,000
like threw

1198
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,000
it was really abusive

1199
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,000
and threw off a balcony

1200
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,000
so she was all mangled

1201
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,000
at the bottom

1202
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,000
I don't know

1203
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,000
I don't know

1204
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,000
she's mangled at the bottom

1205
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,000
but

1206
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,000
like she now uses

1207
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,000
like her rage

1208
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,000

1209
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,000

1229
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,000
do the gen

1230
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,000
and then I'll join in

1231
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,000
they're all getting struck

1232
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,000
I don't know

1233
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,000
I honestly literally thank god

1234
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,000
we're halfway across the map

1235
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,000
leave us alone please

1236
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,000
we're trying our best

1237
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,000
okay there we go

1238
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,000
and then

1239
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,000
I will do this gen with you

1240
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,000
and then we have literally

1241
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,000
outdone our last game

1242
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,000
within like one minute

1243
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,000
if we'd finished this gen

1244
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,000
cause we just

1245
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,000
we already had better game

1246
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,000
I will literally

1247
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,000
I will literally

1248
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,000
look we're MLG pro at this game

1249
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,000

1250
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,000

1251
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,000

1253
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,000
and then

1254
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,000
she appeared out of

1255
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,000
freaking nowhere

1256
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,000

1257
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,000

00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,000
okay tell her for it's no heartbeat

1259
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,000
oh my god she's destroying pallets

1260
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,000
what the heck

1261
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,000
you're not supposed to do that

1262
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,000
or something

1263
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,000
I'm supposed to loop here

1264
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,000
or something around these

1265
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,000
I don't know how the pallets work

1266
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,000
please stop it

1267
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,000
I don't know where to do

1268
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,000
did I just bring her over to you

1269
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,000

00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,000
oh she's sniping

1275
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,000
oh my god

1276
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,000
oh she's breaking the gen

1277
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,000
she's going for me

1278
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,000
she keeps it

1279
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,000
she's ran away from the gen

1280
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,000
she's after someone else then

1281
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,000
oh my god

1282
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,000

1283
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,000
ahhh it's me

1284
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,000
it's me

1285
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,000
it's after

1286
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,000
six

1287
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,000
six to the tenth

1288
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,000
you'll hear a heartbeat

1289
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,000
but I'm underground

1290
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,000
okay you'll hear a heartbeat

1291
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,000
but I'm underground

1292
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,000
I'm underground

1293
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,000
fuck off

1294
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,000
I'm underground

1295
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,000
I'm just running around

1296
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
I'm running around

1297
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
get out of my way

1298
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,000
oh my god stop

1299
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,000
did she find me

1300
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:47,000
I'm getting healed. I'm getting healed. I'll keep moving. Oh my god, that guy is so pissed off.

1301
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,000
Plop, plop, plop, plop. Get healed, get healed.

1302
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,000
Plop, plop, plop.

1303
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,000
Are you still? Is she still?

1304
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,000
She's still going for me. Oh my god, sorry.

1305
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,000
Talk about hashtag tunneling.

1306
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:59,000
Talk about hashtag tunneling. Like, oh my god, if you love me that much, just say...

1307
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,000
Oh my god, stop. Oh my god, she's got me.

1308
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:04,000
Oh my god, you're so rude. Go away.

1309
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,000
Sorry, but you're getting tunneled.

1310
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,000
Oh my god, I'm talking to James about you, so that's totally funny.

1311
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,000
Well, literally, I'm like...

1312
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,000
Oh my god, she's getting...

1313
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,000
I'm literally...

1314
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,000
I don't know what to do. I don't know what to do.

1315
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:22,000
I don't know what to do. Reflins. Reflins. I don't know what to do.

1316
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:25,000
I'm accidentally... I don't know. I think she might have dropped me.

1317
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:28,000
No, I hear a heartbeat, so that can't be right.

1318
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:33,000
I hear that hissing noise. That means she's coming after me.

1319
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,000
What does it mean?

1320
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,000
Oh shit!

1321
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
Okay, sorry, I stalled so much time.

1322
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
You guys are welcome. I stalled so much time.

1323
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
You actually did stalled so many times.

1324
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:47,000
I'm so proud of that gameplay. Sorry, I don't care if we lose.

1325
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,000
I'm so proud of myself for that.

1326
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,000
I'm literally so proud.

1327
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:55,000
If everyone finishes the gen they're working on with one, I think.

1328
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:58,000
Yeah, it means she is invisible and after you.

1329
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:01,000
The panic roll. Literally, I was like, I don't know what to do.

1330
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
That was good for stalling. Thank you.

1331
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
Oh my god, Reflins. Sorry, you're boosting my ego.

1332
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:09,000
You're boosting my ego.

1333
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,000
Take that.

1334
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,000
Who's she even lurking off to?

1335
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,000
I don't know. Someone's getting chased.

1336
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:20,000
But I'm getting helped by two people. Don't mind if I do.

1337
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
Oh my god, I'm getting double healed up.

1338
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
Give me them juicy heals.

1339
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
Wait, where is she going?

1340
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
I don't know why she's not healing now.

1341
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
She really said I don't care.

1342
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
Right, I guess if we bum rush this last gen.

1343
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:35,000
Yeah, I guess. Okay, I'll start in this gen and I'll do the heal.

1344
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,000
And then we all bum it up.

1345
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,000
If mommy was the killer, I wouldn't fight back.

1346
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,000
What? I wouldn't hurt you like that.

1347
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:44,000
That's Mercy's job to hurt. I don't do that.

1348
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:47,000
Okay, let's fucking bum rush this gen and actually escape.

1349
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,000
Imagine if we escaped in our second gen.

1350
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,000
We're so good at this game.

1351
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,000
If we did the 2v8 kill, I was like, what's that?

1352
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:56,000
Do you smell that too, Stranny? That boy you smell?

1353
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,000
Wait, why are you running away, sweetie?

1354
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
Why are you running away?

1355
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
Aw.

1356
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,000
Well, if we finish it, I don't know.

1357
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,000
Maybe they're going to the gate to open it.

1358
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,000
That might be wise.

1359
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000
Oh my god, they're pros. They're actually pros.

1360
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000
They're so smart. What the heck are teammates?

1361
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
They're so smart. We should not question them ever again.

1362
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,000
They're so good.

1363
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
Okay, I think they're opening.

1364
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
I'm going to pray they open the gate wherever it is.

1365
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,000
Right, go.

1366
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,000
Oh my god, where is it?

1367
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:28,000
Right, there's one there and there's one right there.

1368
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
Should we go for it? Oh my god.

1369
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,000
Right, as long as it's upstairs.

1370
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,000
Right, I'm going to do this one because it looks like she's chasing.

1371
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:38,000
I've got empathy, so I can see that per person getting killed right now.

1372
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:41,000
I can literally see them get chased halfway across the map.

1373
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,000
They're downstairs right now.

1374
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:44,000
Her thing.

1375
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
I swear if she comes up on her side of the map, don't be selfish.

1376
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,000
Maybe I should open it on her side by the way, guys.

1377
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,000
Oh no.

1378
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,000
Oh no.

1379
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,000
I don't know if I can save.

1380
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:56,000
I'm on too, so sauce, but because I've been on the hook twice,

1381
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
I don't have to save. No, you've not.

1382
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
Wait, there's a red thing next to your name.

1383
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
Have you been on the hook?

1384
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,000
I think so.

1385
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,000
No, I've not. I don't have it.

1386
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,000
Oh no, I need to go get them, don't I?

1387
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,000
I don't know.

1388
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:12,000
You and the Barbie person hasn't been on,

1389
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:15,000
but I can't do anything like literally sorry, but...

1390
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,000
I'm gone. I'm away. I'm away.

1391
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,000
Where's the hooky?

1392
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
She's pushing me out.

1393
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,000
She's pushing me out.

1394
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,000
I'm lost.

1395
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:26,000
Oh my god.

1396
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
I just opened the gate.

1397
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
Oh fuck, where's the other gate?

1398
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,000
Oh fuck.

1399
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,000
Fuck.

1400
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,000
Wait, let me speak.

1401
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,000
I'm lost.

1402
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,000
I'm so scared.

1403
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,000
I'm not going to make it out.

1404
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:38,000
Wait, how do I...

1405
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,000
Oh bled.

1406
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,000
Oh no, this is not good.

1407
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,000
You need to go upstairs.

1408
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:42,000
Both of the gates are upstairs.

1409
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,000
I'm going back up.

1410
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,000
Yeah, go upstairs first.

1411
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,000
Both of the gates are upstairs.

1412
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,000
I don't like this.

1413
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
And then take left.

1414
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,000
Left, left, left.

1415
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:52,000
Yeah, that way, and then it's a little to the right, I think.

1416
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,000
Left.

1417
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,000
Yeah, right, right.

1418
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,000
Right, right.

1419
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,000
And then...

1420
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,000
That's right.

1421
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:58,000
Left, right.

1422
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,000
I don't know.

1423
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,000
Is it not there?

1424
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,000
Where's the gate?

1425
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,000
There, there, there.

1426
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,000
Left, left, left.

1427
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1428
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,000
No, no, where the killer was.

1429
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,000
Where the killer was.

1430
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,000
Sorry, there's a freaking delay.

1431
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,000
Go, go, go.

1432
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,000
You can make it because even if she hits you, your full health, you can still go out the

1433
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,000
gate.

1434
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,000
The gate's not open.

1435
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,000
They didn't open the other gate.

1436
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,000
Oh my god.

1437
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,000
No way sin died because of my fucking...

1438
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,000
I'm so sorry.

1439
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:16,000
I did it.

1440
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,000
I thought they opened the other gate because the other...

1441
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,000
Oh my god.

1442
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,000
No way sin died because of my fucking...

1443
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:20,000
I'm so sorry.

1444
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,000
I did it.

1445
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:26,000
I thought they opened the other gate because the other freaking person disappeared.

1446
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,000
Game over.

1447
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,000
Oh my god.

1448
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,000
That's so sad.

1449
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,000
Wait, they're so nice.

1450
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,000
What the heck?

1451
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,000
Oh my god.

1452
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,000
Go in.

1453
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,000
Oh my god.

1454
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,000
You need to type GG.

1455
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,000
Oh my god.

1456
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,000
Oh my god.

1457
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,000
GG.

1458
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,000
That was so nice of you.

1459
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,000
Thank you for a lovely game.

1460
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,000
We love you.

1461
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:42,000
Kisses you all over your nice face.

1462
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,000
Oh my god.

1463
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:44,000
Thank you.

1464
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,000
Oh my god.

1465
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,000
Oh my god.

1466
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,000
Kiss.

1467
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:48,000
Kiss.

1468
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,000
Kiss.

1469
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:50,000
Kiss.

1470
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,000
Oh I...

1471
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:55,000
Literally we love caned killers out here.

1472
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:56,000
Oh my god.

1473
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,000
We love you.

1474
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:58,000
Oh my god.

1475
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,000
I was actually going to cry.

1476
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:00,000
We love you.

1477
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,000
Your sir wave.

1478
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,000
Oh.

1479
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,000
That was so nice.

1480
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,000
Oh.

1481
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,000
Oh.

1482
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,000
I mean, thank you.

1483
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,000
Yeah, yeah, cause you didn't...

1484
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,000
You didn't have to let her go.

1485
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,000
That was so nice.

1486
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,000
Oh.

1487
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,000
Literally.

1488
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,000
Oh my god.

1489
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,000
Nice killers.

1490
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:14,000
I had like...

1491
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,000
Streamsaber, you think?

1492
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:20,100
You get nice ones. You get nice ones. I think it was if it was one of you guys you'd be twerking into in 360s

1493
00:36:20,100 --> 00:36:22,340
I don't know you guys to be humpin strongies

1494
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:36,080
I do actually get them pent up so much in streams though. I have to admit I'm a bit outrageous

1495
00:36:36,080 --> 00:36:38,840
Like sometimes I'll look back in a stream and I'll be like, oh my god

1496
00:36:39,720 --> 00:36:44,680
I'll be like did I really say that and then like I'll go in my marshmallows and then they'll be like mommy

1497
00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:50,320
I'm so XYZ and I'm like honestly. Yeah, I'm after what all the stuff I was saying. Yeah. Yeah, that's fair

1498
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:52,000
That's real and true

1499
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:56,800
Cuz literally I'm a bit outrageous and now the refunds are the exact date when to send you more so

1500
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:04,080
That song and before everyone literally guesses my fertile window, thanks to you

1501
00:37:04,520 --> 00:37:06,520
Oh

1502
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:09,120
I'm pregnant nation. Let's go

1503
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:20,760
Well, do you want to know the tea? So I said if I get 20,000 subscribers, I'll show a pic of my butt naked

1504
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:28,920
I hit fucking take a boat. You need to give me a few days lads. You need to give me a few days

1505
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:32,240
Just you mean that

1506
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:36,080
Shut up

1507
00:37:36,080 --> 00:37:42,080
You're making it so much easier to pick cells. It's natural at all. Your wings are showing me that

1508
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:49,080
You've made this so much more cursed than I've ever seen a ladies. No! Oh my god

1509
00:37:50,080 --> 00:37:51,080
Oh my god

1510
00:37:51,080 --> 00:37:57,080
Actually, Mays was last week though. So was it? Wait, do you tell the imps when you're in your ketchup season?

1511
00:37:57,920 --> 00:38:03,600
Yeah, I'm like, sorry guys got shark bait in case the tides to get fucked. Oh, right. Okay. That's all right

1512
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:06,840
I was just like yeah, I've got shark bait, you know

1513
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:12,360
Because it's uncomfortable, you know, like it's actually tummy heart when you're playing games and I'm like, oh my god

1514
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:18,240
I could feel it looking through the fricking chair. I just have painkillers and have a hot water bottle on my stomach the entire time

1515
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:21,980
You just like you can't feel any pain if I'm literally burning my

1516
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:27,680
I like the pain, you know. What? Hold on a minute. I

1517
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:33,640
Like the pain. I like feeling that I have pain so like having pain and not being able to feel my pain. Yes

1518
00:38:34,080 --> 00:38:35,280
Oh

1519
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:40,040
The trick my body into thinking oh everything's hunky-dory. No, you give me that so stomach baby girl

1520
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:42,560
Put my tongue to you by the way because it's not me

1521
00:38:44,680 --> 00:38:50,320
I think what you're doing is called going on a model walking. I do love a little bit of female. Who did that?

1522
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:55,600
Identify yourself. I'm sorry. I'm let you have your dough. Okay. I'm sorry

1523
00:38:55,600 --> 00:39:01,520
Oh, we're in the game with a person from you the last match Barbie is in a game again

1524
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:08,040
Harvey. Oh Barbie. Of course Barbie goes down first practically. No, they just know Barbie's good. Barbie's good

1525
00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:11,040
Right if they go down instantly, we know it's a really hard killer

1526
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:17,040
It's really hard killer that be every flume

1527
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:20,720
You right. Okay. That was actually really smooth

1528
00:39:22,120 --> 00:39:28,800
I'm like trying to try hard on the skill checks. Oh crap. Oh, no, I think it's the zombie one

1529
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:35,440
Where there's zombies on the map, so don't get jump-scared because I think it might be the zombie one

1530
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:40,880
How did she know I mean I've got some eye contact, you know

1531
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:45,600
I mean my favorite killer to play was Michael Myers. I like to just stare at people

1532
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:50,800
Oh my god

1533
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:55,440
It's a big technical guys not and they get them picture

1534
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:59,120
He doesn't even know I'm there. Oh shit. Are you going for the rescue or no?

1535
00:39:59,120 --> 00:40:00,240
I

1536
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:06,280
Guess I have to know that run away. I'm gonna go. I don't know. I hear her heartbeat. We need Barbie Barbie's good

1537
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:09,400
I bet actually, you know what if it wasn't for that last killer

1538
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:13,720
I would be thought so you know what fuck your Barbie didn't open another other door for me. How dare you?

1539
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:20,000
This per guy. He's trying his best on the Jenny keeps popping it. Oh that hard killer

1541
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:27,200
Literally between a rock and a heart are you saving are you saving?

1542
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:33,760
You can I hook again wait. I saved the person. Yeah. Oh, right. Sorry. Sorry. I didn't realize. Oh, it's running away

1543
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:37,000
Somebody's running away. Oh my god. Oh my god. Everyone's running. Oh my god

1544
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:41,240
Oh my god, we're scouting like freaking cockroaches right now when you open a fridge in America

1545
00:40:41,240 --> 00:40:43,960
I'm chasing someone so time to get those Jenny's

1546
00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:46,600
Oh

1547
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:55,600
Wait, oh my god, I don't know if he was one getting changed. Oh, no, no, no, the killer's right there

1548
00:40:55,600 --> 00:40:59,760
Oh my god, sorry, I need to find a gen to do or else that hatch. I'm doing one as we speak

1549
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:08,440
Takes so long though and the zombies coming in trip check like that. Oh, I look they're like they do act as like another whole

1550
00:41:08,840 --> 00:41:10,840
like player thing

1551
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:19,040
That applies more pressure on the I'm gonna have to get this guy cuz it's that black Barbies on like literally

1552
00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:28,840
That's why I hear a harp. I hear one too. I'm being chased so you're safe to do whatever you'd like

1553
00:41:29,080 --> 00:41:31,880
I'm literally going to the other side of the path. Oh

1554
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:35,480
My god, my spine shell keeps going off because he's right behind

1555
00:41:35,480 --> 00:41:36,600
Oh

1556
00:41:36,600 --> 00:41:41,240
What does that mean? I just got whipped by tentacle, but it wasn't a refling school way

1557
00:41:41,240 --> 00:41:43,920
I don't want it. I don't want it. I ain't every flint. I don't want it

1558
00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:48,600
If I ain't a refling's I don't want it. I don't want it. I don't want it

1559
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:49,400
Right, that's it

1560
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:52,320
I'm taking them inside the house because I know the generator's been done in here

1561
00:41:52,320 --> 00:41:56,440
So I'm literally just going nuts going around in circles and again heels up again

1562
00:41:57,480 --> 00:42:01,920
Then he means me doing 360s around this house because I know this is the only gen that's been done

1563
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:10,280
He's spanking me again refling stop. I don't know what to do. Right. Okay. Let's do this bye. I do you to break that fuck you

1564
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:15,440
Beach, I'm so gonna be knocked down. I don't know how I've survived to hit slow

1565
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:17,840
Um

1566
00:42:17,840 --> 00:42:20,800
I'm going around in circles. Surely he knows what I'm doing

1567
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:24,760
Okay, I don't know right. Okay. It's fine

1568
00:42:26,080 --> 00:42:30,800
It's fine. It's fine. Oh my god. There's a there's a guy near me as well

1569
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:35,280
He needs to find this cure. Everyone needs to find the cure before they become zombie

1570
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:43,640
Don't keep getting inked on but it's not refunds. I don't like it. Okay. Let me finish my tea is it literally room temperature

00:42:46,600 --> 00:42:51,120
Okay hydration check refling's an end. Oh no, I saw me. Impling fucking hell. Oh

1572
00:42:52,360 --> 00:42:55,960
No, I didn't. Implings have a mascot, don't they? Did they?

1573
00:42:56,640 --> 00:42:58,640
Yeah, just an imp in a suit

1574
00:43:00,840 --> 00:43:02,840
That's adorable

1575
00:43:03,840 --> 00:43:07,920
Yeah, cuz I got my little office outfit, so it's like, oh look date the office. You're under the desk

You know, we've got

1578
00:43:14,560 --> 00:43:17,200
Ones that do clips, you know, we've got one

1579
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:23,680
He's whipping me. I literally hooked as well. I'm like, oh, yeah, that's been zombie-fied

1580
00:43:23,680 --> 00:43:26,520
Yeah, we're all zombie right now. We're literally all zombie

1581
00:43:28,200 --> 00:43:30,200
Don't stop licking me

1582
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:31,920
So rude

1583
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:39,440

Oh dear we're both coughing and I'm injured not gonna make it

1589
00:44:05,840 --> 00:44:12,120
That's where I live. Come on. How is he in the basement and not down right? I was gonna say sorry, but how are you even doing that?

1590
00:44:13,840 --> 00:44:16,680
Right, I need to be able to freaking take this medication

1591
00:44:20,760 --> 00:44:26,600
Did that just freaking close on me after I opened it you are trolling, right?

1592
00:44:28,440 --> 00:44:30,600
Inject vaccine, okay

1593
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:35,280
That's really faking rude

1594
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:37,280
I

1595
00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:51,080
I thought I was being so sneaky. I'm not I'm not being sneaky at all. I suck. I'm sorry

1596
00:44:51,080 --> 00:44:54,680
I thought it was being so sneaky. Oh

1597
00:44:56,200 --> 00:44:58,200
No, oh

00:44:58,400 --> 00:45:03,920
My god, I'm so I'm infected again. I can't save that guy. I'm so sorry

1599
00:45:03,920 --> 00:45:05,920
I can't save the guy on the hook

1600
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:08,720
I thought oh my god, he's normal. Oh my god

1601
00:45:08,720 --> 00:45:13,560
I wish spine chill gave you like a speed booster saw and if the killer looks at you for like longer than two things

1602
00:45:13,560 --> 00:45:15,560
Thanks, I'd appreciate that stop

1603
00:45:15,960 --> 00:45:19,880
Stop. Oh my god. I missed his tentacle. That's right. You're not refland only we've been through a tentacle me

1604
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:24,760
Oh my god, I'm not gonna make it only go

1605
00:45:25,800 --> 00:45:29,200
Go men a story team go men a story, but I

1606
00:45:30,040 --> 00:45:31,160
I

1607
00:45:31,160 --> 00:45:34,000
Sorry to get generators done. We're all literally fried

1608
00:45:34,240 --> 00:45:39,440
Let's I don't know what happens with the vaccine like we don't cure the vaccine answering. We just succumbed to death

1609
00:45:41,120 --> 00:45:43,120
Yeah, so I'm just like that

1610
00:45:43,520 --> 00:45:45,520
Can you highlight your white chest?

1611
00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:53,840
Very the hell is a team I want you the entire team is with you apparently it looks like oh no big killer boys coming

1612
00:45:53,840 --> 00:45:55,440
I'm getting healed

1613
00:45:55,440 --> 00:45:58,600
You can break out of it with sprint you can break out of healing with sprint

1614
00:46:00,080 --> 00:46:02,080
Oh my god

1615
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:07,800
Electrally healing me for ten hours. Oh, that was that was too risky. I'll ask me going on a hook

1616
00:46:07,800 --> 00:46:13,120
Oh, wait. No, he's okay. No, it's chasing others now. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, no, I'm getting picked up

1617
00:46:13,120 --> 00:46:15,920
I have to admit it's nice being able to see like

1618
00:46:16,360 --> 00:46:21,400
What the teammates are doing like I can see if they recover or they're doing a Jenner, etc

1619
00:46:21,400 --> 00:46:25,800
That is a very big quality of life improvement when it with a game that has no communication

1620
00:46:26,200 --> 00:46:28,480
Oh, it's trying is what you're doing and when you're doing it

1621
00:46:30,920 --> 00:46:34,880
Well, I'm in the basement, so do you this is what it's like to be in the basement

1622
00:46:35,560 --> 00:46:37,560
We're all coughing and dying

1623
00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:40,000
I don't know what to do

1624
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:42,000
Are you a really healthy team?

1625
00:46:42,320 --> 00:46:45,880
Yeah, I was spine chills going off as well. Well, oh

1626
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:49,520
Did he see me be honest? I think I just saw him. I

1627
00:46:51,200 --> 00:46:55,760
Think my days are not anyone's numbered, but they're fucking I'm the quality that's running to you

1628
00:46:55,800 --> 00:46:57,800
Is anyone further ahead than me?

1629
00:46:58,520 --> 00:46:59,840
Let's know

1630
00:46:59,840 --> 00:47:03,720
They're all coming for me. Are we all going for it? Right? Oh, no, they're not

1631
00:47:05,080 --> 00:47:10,640
Okay, I'm coming. It's me. It's me. I'm coming. I don't know where the entry to the frickin basement is though

1632
00:47:13,560 --> 00:47:15,560
And

1633
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:19,480
No, it's not. No, you're not the dude or something got me now. What the fuck?

1634
00:47:20,120 --> 00:47:24,040
Okay, that's fine. That's fine. I'm just gonna do this just really wants to heal me

1635
00:47:25,040 --> 00:47:28,480
Maybe it's a street night, but are you every one are an infant? Oh

1636
00:47:31,560 --> 00:47:38,360
My god, the zombies are so nice. Where's the imps any imps called Jesse and Barbie in the chat

1637
00:47:39,880 --> 00:47:41,880
Hi, I'm Barbie

1640
00:47:53,160 --> 00:47:55,160
Life in plastic

All right means in cover when

1642
00:48:03,440 --> 00:48:07,640
Oh my god, we've all been on the hook twice it's over. Sorry, but we're not making this one out alive

1643
00:48:08,600 --> 00:48:11,800
No, this is even worse. Oh

1644
00:48:12,680 --> 00:48:13,880
Oh

1645
00:48:13,880 --> 00:48:18,760
My god, everyone dies when they go on I got impaled by a fucking tentacle

1646
00:48:18,760 --> 00:48:22,520
If everyone's gonna die on hook, I need to be selfish and look for the fucking thing

1647
00:48:23,480 --> 00:48:25,480
I'm saying that bad boy. No

1648
00:48:26,240 --> 00:48:30,560
I'm trying. I don't know if I can heal myself or my moans are gonna give everything away. I

1649
00:48:31,760 --> 00:48:33,880
Think my moans are gonna give everything away. I

1650
00:48:35,880 --> 00:48:40,560
Think I think this is a fool everyone dies for it. Oh, I just fucking stabbed myself

1651
00:48:42,800 --> 00:48:45,960
And how do you fail putting bandages on yourself, honestly

1652
00:48:48,160 --> 00:48:51,360
Getting chased back. I don't mind if I go down the mic

1653
00:48:52,480 --> 00:48:57,840
Here thing he got more expecting. Oh wait. They have a moray. Oh my god. There he is

1654
00:48:57,960 --> 00:49:01,960
Yeah, he impaled my fucking body. No, he just closed the

1655
00:49:03,760 --> 00:49:08,280
It was right there and he just closed the damn thing. Oh

1656
00:49:09,160 --> 00:49:11,160
That's so annoying

1657
00:49:12,800 --> 00:49:17,640
That is so annoying. Sorry, but this is really intense. I'm literally not making this out alive

1658
00:49:18,280 --> 00:49:23,640
Like if he comes over, I'm just except that I'm not making out alive. I'm gonna hear the heartbeat. Oh fuck. Well

1659
00:49:24,280 --> 00:49:29,480
Hi, can I give you this? Can I can you just let me go? Can I can I?

1660
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:34,200
No, you're supposed to look away. You're supposed to look away

1661
00:49:36,360 --> 00:49:38,360
You're supposed to look away

1662
00:49:38,680 --> 00:49:43,320
And let me out you think you can you think he

1663
00:49:43,880 --> 00:49:47,720
He literally looked away as well like he almost fell he fell for it

1664
00:49:47,720 --> 00:49:51,000
Sorry, he fell for that look behind you and then I literally escaped

1665
00:49:54,080 --> 00:49:58,800
Okay, that was a GG. I'm not too mad. He played very well. I'm a pity to me in my name. Okay

1666
00:49:58,800 --> 00:50:06,240
I'm GG. Well play all good luck in next game exclamation mark. Oh my god. I'm such a nice dad by daily thingie. Um, oh my god

1667
00:50:07,040 --> 00:50:11,840
I'm gonna endorse you right now. Oh my god. Thanks for the endorsement. Oh my god. They came with a freaking moray

1668
00:50:12,800 --> 00:50:15,120
Oh, he never had any perks. I miss me very new

1669
00:50:17,600 --> 00:50:23,120
Right, I'm I mean business that I'm putting add-ons on. Oh my god. We were so serious and after hooking a survivor

1670
00:50:23,120 --> 00:50:29,360
All their survivors are revealed for five sayings. Okay, that makes sense why he was able to come straight for us whenever like that happened

1671
00:50:29,680 --> 00:50:35,120
He just picked her up and carried her like a sports bag, bro

1672
00:50:35,120 --> 00:50:39,280
Honestly, I got manhandled that that gay assault. I'm saying I got literally manhandled like

1673
00:50:42,400 --> 00:50:44,400
I just get put in his pocket

1674
00:50:45,680 --> 00:50:47,680
He just carries me

1675
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:51,840
All right, put him in my pocket. There you go. Pop it. Lock it poke it off it

1676
00:50:52,560 --> 00:50:54,560
No, I don't hang the hat

1677
00:50:55,840 --> 00:50:57,840
That is kind of Montana. Yeah

1678
00:50:58,720 --> 00:51:05,680
Why do I remember why is that I'm looking the whole time? I just noticed that your weapon is locked onto your boob jiggle physics

1679
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:09,680
That's actually really funny. The weapon's like jiggling with your bitch

1680
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:14,800
John. Oh, yeah, you like me in that office. Oh my god. I'm so jealous, bro

1681
00:51:14,960 --> 00:51:18,400
I'm so jealous that you can just like right strong and get your glasses on

1682
00:51:19,040 --> 00:51:20,160
Oh

00:51:20,880 --> 00:51:23,040
Oh, if you guys wait, wait, if you guys didn't know hold on

00:51:37,680 --> 00:51:42,400
It I just look your eye out. I'm sorry. It literally pops her blouse pops open

1688
00:51:42,640 --> 00:51:45,920
Is that no amazing or is that no amazing? Like I don't know how much I said

1689
00:51:46,800 --> 00:51:50,160
But and she can make them we are bigger right now. They're big

1690
00:51:50,960 --> 00:51:56,080
But she can literally be like, oh John. I'm back. I'm back. I literally humongous

1691
00:51:56,960 --> 00:52:02,960
Like if you guys didn't know literally her thing is pinned in the chat, but it is absolutely amazing

1692
00:52:03,040 --> 00:52:08,880
So but she has so many that's why the killer keeps getting me undead. I didn't hear my tits clapping against my kneecaps. Oh my

1693
00:52:09,680 --> 00:52:11,680
That all right

1694
00:52:12,320 --> 00:52:13,840
That's so cute

1695
00:52:13,840 --> 00:52:18,560
You hear me before you see me or you smell me before you see me. Oh my god. Maybe that's you actually

1696
00:52:19,520 --> 00:52:23,840
You don't you smell straya for you. Oh my god. I'd be pheromone max and every time I play a freaking game

1698
00:52:31,040 --> 00:52:33,040
Do you want to fonder my abysm?

1699
00:52:33,040 --> 00:52:34,480
If you want to

1700
00:52:34,480 --> 00:52:36,480
Or am I cat and beat?

1701
00:52:36,480 --> 00:52:43,200
A star that would like like it's not I can literally go and type in fonder right now and see all the other fucking

1702
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:48,720
I'm like, I'm holding sin's hand. She's gonna support me. Oh my god. I'm so pale compared to you

1703
00:52:51,200 --> 00:52:53,440
Like the only toggle I have is literally

1704
00:52:54,400 --> 00:52:57,840
On all my talk with all the names. I said fondle a cock

1705
00:52:59,040 --> 00:53:00,880
Fondle a cock

1706
00:53:00,880 --> 00:53:02,880
Oh my god

1707
00:53:03,600 --> 00:53:08,320
Oh my god, let me pop you back down. I see bander. I see erection. I see erection

1708
00:53:08,960 --> 00:53:14,880
No, don't do that with ac's name because everyone's gonna call her ac erection there. No, I see a cock

1709
00:53:16,320 --> 00:53:18,320
My baby

1710
00:53:18,320 --> 00:53:21,840
All right, we found out that bend there is erection in french

1711
00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:26,640
And we thought it was brilliant. We did come on. We thought it was brilliant

1712
00:53:26,640 --> 00:53:32,240
And like then it come on. I'm a simple. I'm a simple thing a simple thing. I'm a simple creature

1713
00:53:32,320 --> 00:53:36,880
I like a funny one. I'm actually fan girl. I'm like, oh my god. I love it so much in capitals

1714
00:53:37,360 --> 00:53:39,360
Stop

1715
00:53:40,320 --> 00:53:47,600
Someone says AC I cock. What the fuck? No, I said you a message at 3am saying I can't sleep

1716
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:51,600
I like the word play fondle my fondle and my titties are some fish

1717
00:53:52,720 --> 00:53:55,520
Fondle my bigos. Why did I wake up at 3am?

1718
00:53:58,400 --> 00:54:02,080
Bruh sin's.. I couldn't sleep for five seconds. I couldn't sleep. I couldn't sleep. Hilarious to work with. I'm not gonna lie

1719
00:54:02,080 --> 00:54:10,160
simple areas to work with. Hence why Strawni has all the brains. Are you joking? I'm brainless.

1720
00:54:10,160 --> 00:54:16,760
The little monkey like, like the wee symbols. The monkey with the symbols in the corner

1721
00:54:16,760 --> 00:54:23,160
like, Strawni hates her high IQ. She does, she does. Far from it, far from it. She hates

1722
00:54:23,160 --> 00:54:26,160
that juicy IQ. I'm telling you, I'm telling you. I don't know what you're talking about.

1723
00:54:26,160 --> 00:54:30,160
Her name's the Yandere Karambi that has absolutely nothing to do with a weapon. Okay, okay, how

1724
00:54:30,240 --> 00:54:35,600
did I do that? No, I was like, that's broken. I was like, that's absolutely broken. Lock

1725
00:54:35,600 --> 00:54:44,440
it in. Absolutely. Right, hold on. I'm almost level 50 on one character. Does that mean

1726
00:54:44,440 --> 00:54:53,080
I get another steam achievement for being such a good girl? I'm level 38. Sure, we'll

1727
00:54:53,080 --> 00:54:57,240
do hope three. Why not? Even though I don't use hope, I don't know what it is. I don't

1728
00:54:57,240 --> 00:55:01,480
know what it is. Combine everything. Yeah, that's true. Strawni's got the booty clap

1729
00:55:01,480 --> 00:55:05,720
and then my tits are clapped and so it's like, no, no, no, no, no, no. Wait, can I

1730
00:55:05,720 --> 00:55:10,720
do a sports bra on right now? Can you do? My tits are like, really tight. I was gonna,

1731
00:55:10,720 --> 00:55:14,920
for no particular reason, can you clap with your, right, for those of you who don't know

1732
00:55:14,920 --> 00:55:20,720
the lore, I'm flat chested, there is. I've literally have the smallest chest. Is it possible

1733
00:55:20,720 --> 00:55:26,160
if you have a big enough goober's that you can clap with them? Is this possible? Probs,

1734
00:55:26,240 --> 00:55:30,200
I don't have massive goober's. I don't have massive, I have my feature mode on this, but

1735
00:55:30,200 --> 00:55:32,520
I know you're trying to go for it. Hold on a minute. I'm pretty sure Shibi has massive

1736
00:55:32,520 --> 00:55:36,480
knockers. I'm going to ask her to record an ASMR real quick. Shibi's the expert tease

1737
00:55:36,480 --> 00:55:43,200
for that. Defo, we go to Shibi now for a whole trip. Hold on, wait, let me just DM her. Hold

1738
00:55:43,200 --> 00:55:46,280
on. I can't forget them on YouTube. I should be using other code names that come right out

1739
00:55:46,440 --> 00:55:59,600
of like, you know, Goobies. I'll call them Goobies. Yeah, big Goobies. Hold on right. Okay,

1740
00:55:59,600 --> 00:56:09,480
dear Shibi, I have heard through whispers that you have big, massive honkers. If in theory you

1741
00:56:09,560 --> 00:56:18,840
could clap with them in the ASMR mic, please do not hesitate to record said audio and I will,

1742
00:56:20,200 --> 00:56:27,000
I will edit it for you. Love you. I'm indebted. I've never seen a YouTuber clap to her boobs clip.

1743
00:56:27,960 --> 00:56:35,800
Oh my God, is that witch again that can, oh the, the Japanese. Yeah, she, why does she sound like

1744
00:56:36,120 --> 00:56:42,280
a popped air balloon? Well, like, so she got her, the lures, her dad was really abusive

1745
00:56:42,280 --> 00:56:46,680
and she got shoved off a balcony and she smashed into a mirror, which is like why there's mirror

1746
00:56:46,680 --> 00:56:50,280
all in her, her flesh. There's always a mirror involved with a scaredy girl with long hair.

1747
00:56:50,280 --> 00:56:55,880
A bruh on it? Yeah, what the fuck? You're, you know what, that's it. Oh my God, I found someone.

1748
00:56:55,880 --> 00:56:59,400
Is that you? I think I found you. Oh my God, I found you. Right, let's do this gen together.

1749
00:56:59,800 --> 00:57:05,800
Get it done. What was that? Did you hear that thunder? That thunder? Was that she be

1750
00:57:05,800 --> 00:57:09,480
clapping her boobs? Holy crap. She's fast. She's fast. You have one.

1751
00:57:15,720 --> 00:57:23,000
Okay, fast. We're doing this. Oh, we're so fast. Faster. Faster. Faster. Faster. Faster. It's a

1752
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:28,760
boon hair. That clap hit round the world. Either that was my cheeks or someone's

1753
00:57:28,760 --> 00:57:34,040
feel or someone's. I've never tried that tech clap, honestly. I never really crossed my mind,

1754
00:57:34,040 --> 00:57:40,040
like, oh, I can't even clap them. Reveal the truth, momma. I mean, what's the truth? Good

1755
00:57:40,040 --> 00:57:44,680
bars, the big good bars. Have you called them? I say good bars. That's what I used to call them.

1756
00:57:45,800 --> 00:57:52,440
If you want some more, momma, cuddles, lures. My mom has fat fucking honkers and I have the

1757
00:57:52,440 --> 00:57:56,440
flash chest. I don't know where the fuck the genetics went because it clearly didn't.

1758
00:57:57,080 --> 00:58:01,960
I know where my genetics are going. Bruh, literally. Wait, what?

1759
00:58:04,040 --> 00:58:10,280
Wait, wait, wait. Oh, shit. Are they trying to slug? Why is my screen blue?

1760
00:58:12,840 --> 00:58:18,600
You're blue screening. Wait, oh my God. Wait, is this totem you can pick yourself up if you go

1761
00:58:18,680 --> 00:58:24,280
down near it? I've never heard that in my life, but I guess it's been years since I've played.

1762
00:58:25,080 --> 00:58:30,520
So they came out with this hex girl because obviously all the totem weave pull things are for...

1763
00:58:34,360 --> 00:58:39,000
Am I about to get walloped? Oh, I'm about to get walloped. Sorry. I'm being a cheeky bam here and

1764
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:45,880
that. Oh, I'm so sorry. Do you want to heal? Is she chasing you? Oh, shit, come on.

1765
00:58:49,480 --> 00:58:53,480
Soz, Annie. Okay, she's fine. Right, you're on your own, mate. Soz, you're on your own. I'm letting

1766
00:58:53,480 --> 00:59:02,440
sin deal with the gen. Soz. Literally just one down. Four more to go. Right, so...

1767
00:59:02,920 --> 00:59:09,320
Oh, my God. Wait, our teammates are really good because I think they were teabagging. I can't tell.

1768
00:59:09,320 --> 00:59:14,120
Soz, but if a teammate teabags when they're getting chased by the killer, I'm like, oh my

1769
00:59:14,120 --> 00:59:18,520
God, we're in good hands. I know it's toxic. I know it's toxic behavior and I know it's not nice.

1770
00:59:22,120 --> 00:59:28,680
I'm sorry, but... I'm being a cheeky soz like that. I'd be a rage if that was the killing

1771
00:59:28,760 --> 00:59:32,680
fucker team. Oh, my God, but I played the killer before and I kept getting teabags in like the

1772
00:59:33,480 --> 00:59:39,000
torch in my eyeballs. I was human. I was absolutely raging. I'm getting exposed by my gen mate. Oh,

1773
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:44,840
my God. Sorry. The whole company is imploding. You want to know the lore about my prego ASMR

1774
00:59:44,840 --> 00:59:49,960
video, soz. Yes, I had to use sheebie's heartbeat because mine was too fast.

1775
00:59:50,920 --> 00:59:55,960
Oh, what the fuck? Oh, there's a fake heartbeat.

1776
00:59:58,920 --> 01:00:03,160
What? Wait, is he cheating? How did he get off the hood? Why am I blue?

1777
01:00:05,080 --> 01:00:10,440
It's a totem where you can pick yourself up. Why is your heartbeat so fast? I have a very unhealthy

1778
01:00:10,440 --> 01:00:17,400
heart. I'm literally a hamster unironically. I can't use my own heartbeat because it's too fast

1779
01:00:17,480 --> 01:00:22,680
and sheebie recorded some and I was like, sheebie, can I use your heartbeat because mine's messed up?

1780
01:00:22,680 --> 01:00:27,720
And she was like, yes, sure. And I'm like, thank you. So yeah, the truth is it's not my heartbeat in

1781
01:00:27,720 --> 01:00:31,960
the prego ASMR because mine's too fast and uncomfortable. I thought the bail blocker fell.

1782
01:00:31,960 --> 01:00:37,880
But my fucking heart is pumping out after that. Oh, my God. Jesus. Supposing the company from the inside out.

1783
01:00:38,840 --> 01:00:47,320
Chocolate behavior, honestly. Who snitched? I guess sheebie question why? It's not a big deal.

1784
01:00:47,320 --> 01:00:52,200
Is it? It's not a big deal. That's absolutely a big deal. That's absolutely shocking behavior.

1785
01:00:52,200 --> 01:00:57,400
Be a blocker is to try and stop me. Me, we heart from pumping too much, but soz. I don't know.

1786
01:00:57,400 --> 01:01:02,280
Oh, it's snatched. They use each other's parts next, huh? No. Trust issues. They're typing your real

1787
01:01:02,280 --> 01:01:07,080
part. Is that your real part? Is that your? Oh, my God. Imagine if I'm a sound boarder.

1788
01:01:07,080 --> 01:01:16,840
Yeah, literally, literally. Oh, I heard a new thunder lies as your hair sounds are they real?

1789
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:23,720
My hair. Yeah, that's my girl. I've given you my fucking hair sounds to use in an audience.

1790
01:01:23,720 --> 01:01:27,560
Are your are your slosh sounds real? Yeah. Yeah.

1791
01:01:27,560 --> 01:01:38,600
Yeah. Right. Okay. If you want the motherfucking tea, Alex, I'm in trouble. I'm in trouble soz.

1792
01:01:38,600 --> 01:01:43,240
I'm in trouble. Trubs. Forget the meme. Drop the memes. I'm in trouble. This is serious.

1793
01:01:43,240 --> 01:01:48,680
Never know. I'm not laughing. I'm not laughing. Sorry. I'm not here. I'm getting scared. I'm getting

1794
01:01:48,680 --> 01:01:55,560
scared. I need to feel. I'm still feeling. Oh, my med kit. No, it's over. I'm serious now. There's

1795
01:01:55,560 --> 01:02:01,320
no fucking lolly gag in this is serious. Oh, I just got jumpscoot again. Oh, my God. We're all

1796
01:02:01,320 --> 01:02:09,800
injured. I want to win one game where we both get out. I still feel so bad about that song map

1797
01:02:09,800 --> 01:02:14,200
because I thought you were on the different side, but I get so confused like I wish. I know the maps

1798
01:02:14,200 --> 01:02:18,280
aren't supposed to be easy. Like this isn't supposed to be like the easiest game ever to win,

1799
01:02:18,280 --> 01:02:23,080
but like, come on, the freaking both gates should go flying open or something. I don't know. It was

1800
01:02:23,160 --> 01:02:26,840
a fact that I went to go down to save that guy so you could get out, but something already saved

1801
01:02:26,840 --> 01:02:34,440
up and it's like they all got out and I'm like, oh, come on. Come on. Who's being chased? Are you

1802
01:02:34,440 --> 01:02:43,240
being chased? I'm just injured. Yeah, I'm fully saved. Oh, there's the enemy over there. Don't go

1803
01:02:43,240 --> 01:02:47,800
there. Don't go there. The enemy's right. We need to get the genies. Did we do one in here?

1804
01:02:48,760 --> 01:02:56,040
I don't know. I haven't even been in here yet. I'm looking for a gen. I'm looking for a gen. See,

1805
01:02:56,040 --> 01:02:59,240
this is a problem. I hate when it's not obvious where the freaking gen's are. I know they have

1806
01:02:59,240 --> 01:03:03,320
like big massive lights and all that, but am I going mental and I can't see them or...

1807
01:03:06,520 --> 01:03:09,400
Oh, no. Yeah, we're not even live right now. This is a sound board.

1808
01:03:10,280 --> 01:03:15,000
Stop. The refunds say that. They're like, oh, my God, this is all pre-made streams and that. I'm

1809
01:03:15,080 --> 01:03:17,800
like, what are you on about? Like, oh, my God, I'm literally live.

1810
01:03:20,040 --> 01:03:25,800
Yeah. Sin is actually voice acting and strong. Yeah, real. It's true. Real, real.

1811
01:03:25,800 --> 01:03:31,640
I practice. Hi, my big friends. Good morning. Good afternoon. Good day. Close enough. I'm

1812
01:03:31,640 --> 01:03:39,160
strong. Close enough. Bring her in. Bring her in. Right. I'm taking a break. Are you inking for me,

1813
01:03:39,160 --> 01:03:46,360
sweeties? Are you inking for me, darling? Good boy. Oh, shit. Oh, shit. Sorry. Run, run, run, run.

1814
01:03:46,360 --> 01:03:53,960
They're going to know we're here. She's been hired. Oh, shit. I hear the heartbeat. We're in trouble.

1815
01:03:56,680 --> 01:03:59,560
Wait, I don't, I don't hear a heartbeat anymore. Oh, that's why.

1816
01:03:59,560 --> 01:04:03,800
She's on my arse. She's on your arse hole. She's literally twerking on it.

1817
01:04:04,600 --> 01:04:10,200
We are reputable. No. That's your impression. That's my favorite. Darling, what's wrong?

1818
01:04:10,200 --> 01:04:15,560
Oh, the voice is fucked. I'll let you know. I'll let you know. Oh, what's wrong, sweetie pie?

1819
01:04:15,560 --> 01:04:22,840
Bleeding hearts. It's kind of there, but Azura naturally has that, like, pure six.

1820
01:04:22,840 --> 01:04:27,400
I don't know if I can save you. I wish I could have that voice. Bro. It's such a good voice,

1821
01:04:27,400 --> 01:04:32,120
honestly. I would never shop if that was me. I'd be like, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep.

1822
01:04:32,120 --> 01:04:37,240
Oh, well, her tag is adorable. It's yet per corn, which is gracious. I think that's the cutest

1823
01:04:37,240 --> 01:04:42,680
thing ever. That's cute. We are real. The stream is just pre-recorded. It is. Thank you for doing it

1824
01:04:42,680 --> 01:04:48,040
at the right time stamp. Okay, I'm going to finish this gen, and then I'm going to

1825
01:04:48,040 --> 01:04:51,640
know I'm not because there is a random thing that stops me. What is everyone else up to?

1826
01:04:51,640 --> 01:04:55,320
Someone's claiming for windows and they just fell down. What do you mean everyone else?

1827
01:04:55,320 --> 01:04:59,240
It's just us. We're the only ones left. Oh, we're dead, but it's been.

1828
01:05:02,360 --> 01:05:07,400
We're doing really good. Oh, fuck's sake. That shows you how much I'm paying attention. I was

1829
01:05:07,400 --> 01:05:12,920
just so shocked over the heartbeat. That didn't pay attention. Half working her litches six feet

1830
01:05:12,920 --> 01:05:20,040
under. Oh shit, what's going on? I'm trying. Are you moving? Dane, I have botanino. Oh shit, run!

1831
01:05:20,760 --> 01:05:34,280
Run, run, run. She's here. Oh, for fuck's sake. I give up. That's rude. No, I want a new game.

1832
01:05:34,280 --> 01:05:40,520
I want a new lobby. I want a new lobby. I want a chance for us to win. Go and just let me and

1833
01:05:40,520 --> 01:05:47,160
my friend go. Sorry, go and just let my friend go. Go and just let her go. Go and just let her go.

1834
01:05:47,160 --> 01:05:52,520
No, no, she's mine. Let me give you my med kit or whatever. Look, I'm going to take, no,

1835
01:05:52,520 --> 01:05:59,000
stop it. I'm going to take her off the hook. You stop that. Right, and then take, no, no, take me

1836
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:08,440
in her place. Wait, she's actually chasing you. No. Why? Bro, you're- Oh my god, she's like,

1837
01:06:08,440 --> 01:06:13,880
why does she want to break? She just want to break the fucking- Stop, why? No, you're going to die

1838
01:06:14,440 --> 01:06:19,320
Su-chara, what the guy? What a fucking Su-chara. I'm actually raging.

1839
01:06:20,680 --> 01:06:25,640
No, you're awake for it. Stop it. I'm healing. No, you're awake for it. What a wet wipe, honestly.

1840
01:06:25,640 --> 01:06:29,160
Literally, speaking of wet wipe, I can literally see her bot crack. You need to clean that better,

1841
01:06:29,160 --> 01:06:36,360
hey. Literally. I see that. I feel like starfish. I see that. That's it. I'm wiggling off, but I'm

1842
01:06:36,360 --> 01:06:40,840
like, take a chance on hook. Take a chance on hook. Can we touch hands? Can we crawl to- No!

1843
01:06:40,920 --> 01:06:45,320
No! She's doing it. She's killing me with her fucking- She'll let you just stab her.

1844
01:06:45,320 --> 01:06:50,840
Right, I'm dead. Mummy, your charisma check failed. We'll get a nice killer one day. Look,

1845
01:06:50,840 --> 01:06:55,160
I just want to win one game we're sinned before I have to go offline. Is that so bad? Is that?

1846
01:06:55,160 --> 01:07:00,920
It's her nip, so what the fuck? No, she is clothed, but like, it's very revealing, not-

1847
01:07:00,920 --> 01:07:03,960
Let's say I managed to fuck all that game, because it was like everyone was going off the hook.

1848
01:07:04,920 --> 01:07:10,760
We've got the bad ending yet again. Mummy, the negotiator. Literally, just let my friend go.

1849
01:07:10,760 --> 01:07:15,400
She's not even- I got a thing. Where did I get 17k points from? Just apparently

1850
01:07:15,400 --> 01:07:19,160
did an achievement. GG, we'll play all good luck. Next. Ilyu.

1851
01:07:22,840 --> 01:07:27,400
Excuse me. I'm actually raging. We both can't be killers. Like, what the fuck?

1852
01:07:29,160 --> 01:07:33,400
Well, there's a- Did you not see the blood point boost that said if you pick survivor,

1853
01:07:33,400 --> 01:07:37,640
you get 400% extra blood points, I think, because everyone wants to be the killer in

1854
01:07:37,640 --> 01:07:41,800
the game mode, that they can't find anyone. I mean, wait, hold on. Actually, you know what,

1855
01:07:41,800 --> 01:07:48,520
let's try it. Hold on. Let's go again. We'll try if we can do survive in the 2v8. Okay,

1856
01:07:48,520 --> 01:07:53,400
survivors is literally a 400% blood bonus, so I'll invite you in and we'll see what happens.

1857
01:07:53,400 --> 01:08:01,240
Have to do more generators. Maybe. Maybe, baby. I'm not sure. I'm just readying up,

1858
01:08:01,240 --> 01:08:04,840
and we'll give it a few minutes. We'll have a little cooldown. We'll have a little hydration

1859
01:08:04,840 --> 01:08:12,200
check in, please. All right, I got my Bepis. Cheers, everybody. Cheers. She's on the wrong

1860
01:08:12,200 --> 01:08:16,920
team, clearly, drinking Bepis, but whatever. Do you mean they're on the wrong team? If I say it

1861
01:08:16,920 --> 01:08:23,240
to my face? We can play the killers and make you two win. Stop. That was our 4% to get off the hook.

1862
01:08:23,240 --> 01:08:28,040
Yeah. Mummy, you can fill the melody. So we're playing until you win. No, unfortunately, I do

1863
01:08:28,040 --> 01:08:34,440
have an ASMR membership stream after this. I know. So, can you? Can you happen? Can you happen?

1864
01:08:35,320 --> 01:08:40,840
If they needed insurance. Try to be a killer in 2v8 yesterday. It took about 15 minutes for each

1865
01:08:40,840 --> 01:08:44,920
game. Right, we're going to give it a minute, and, you know, for can you? I'm just going to end up

1866
01:08:44,920 --> 01:08:50,280
a podcast waiting on the next game. Oh, bro. Anyway, welcome to the podcast, everybody.

1867
01:08:50,280 --> 01:08:53,160
Welcome to the pub. Doing the pub, that's our podcast name.

1868
01:08:53,720 --> 01:08:59,880
What is the topic of conversation on this podcast? I don't even know what we're talking about.

1869
01:09:01,240 --> 01:09:06,440
I don't have anything interesting to say, like, ever. I'm just like, yeah, hi. Same.

1870
01:09:08,440 --> 01:09:12,280
I don't like Coke, though, because Coke makes it look like my teeth are wearing

1871
01:09:12,280 --> 01:09:16,760
Ugg boots. Oh, because of the sugars. Yeah, it's like my teeth are wearing Ugg boots.

1872
01:09:16,760 --> 01:09:20,520
That's such a good descriptive. I would say, like, brush your teeth. You need to brush the

1873
01:09:20,520 --> 01:09:26,120
peas and poos out your mouth, that's what I say. Well, that's what it is. It's the germs

1874
01:09:26,120 --> 01:09:30,200
that do like peas and poos in your mouth, basically. Chicken Parma. Well, actually,

1875
01:09:30,200 --> 01:09:35,000
chicken Parma is on meat basis. So two Scots enter a bar. Oh my God, that would be what the podcast

1876
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:40,920
is called. I'd listen to a podcast of these two for hours. We'd have to pick something to talk

1877
01:09:40,920 --> 01:09:45,400
about, though. But because I'm also Eastern European, you know, it's vodka. It's vodka as well.

1878
01:09:45,400 --> 01:09:49,240
Some are gone. Vodka and whiskey walk into a bar. That would be the name of the podcast.

1879
01:09:49,960 --> 01:09:53,960
Vodka. Oh my God, I love that vodka and whiskey. Oh my God. And they mix it together.

1880
01:09:54,760 --> 01:09:57,160
Okay. Yes, love it. Love it. It wouldn't be yet.

1881
01:10:00,760 --> 01:10:04,120
The tea, we just talk about all the tea. One gets so drunk and starts

1882
01:10:04,120 --> 01:10:09,240
suddenly talking in Russian. Oh, no. You need to teach me more Russian. The only thing I've

1883
01:10:09,240 --> 01:10:16,280
picked up off of her is literally Privyet, Cactella and Sika. Or you can be more like the colour

1884
01:10:16,280 --> 01:10:25,800
way. That's the colour way. The colour way. You can say like the cool Gopnik way to say

1885
01:10:25,800 --> 01:10:32,120
hi, guys. You say hello, guys. Hello, guys. Hello. Hello. Everyone knows Blyat. Oh my God,

1886
01:10:32,120 --> 01:10:37,960
you guys, you're listening to me. I'm surprised. I'm learning. I would have taught us instead, though.

1887
01:10:37,960 --> 01:10:42,120
Literally. I can't even turn around to be like, oh, let me teach some Scots. She already fucking

1888
01:10:42,120 --> 01:10:47,160
knows it. She already got the cheeks. She already got the regional cheeks on. I went to Scotland

1889
01:10:47,160 --> 01:10:52,040
to steal your jobs and ended up with this. I know, literally. End up with this local card.

1890
01:10:52,040 --> 01:10:57,960
Literally stole your job. I can't believe it. I stole your fucking job. What are you going to do

1891
01:10:57,960 --> 01:11:05,640
about it? Absolutely none. I ain't got a choice. Yeah, well, at least that's one thing would be in

1892
01:11:05,640 --> 01:11:12,920
a slag. Who's Jap the Dastille, huh? How do you say tentacle in Russian? Literally, I don't fucking

1893
01:11:12,920 --> 01:11:17,480
know. Let's look it up, lads. Let's look up tentacle. It's not something I really had to use in Russian

1894
01:11:17,480 --> 01:11:25,240
if I'm being honest. And before, it's like some vialing. I went to be an East lag, but Sin took

1895
01:11:25,240 --> 01:11:32,520
my idea. Literally got stream sniped by Sin in 14. Someone says bubuk. Oh, shupaltse. That's

1896
01:11:32,600 --> 01:11:48,120
pretty cute. Shupaltse. Me playing. Give me a shupalse. We got scotch whiskey in vodka.

1897
01:11:49,880 --> 01:11:51,560
Someone says feliz navida.

1898
01:11:52,520 --> 01:11:52,920
Close.

1899
01:11:56,440 --> 01:11:57,080
Puskagurva.

1900
01:11:59,480 --> 01:12:09,080
Yo, I'm trying. Yo quiero aprender el español. Si, en este momento yo aprendo, aprendido el español

1901
01:12:09,080 --> 01:12:16,200
porque muchísimo, mi chat, si habla español.

1902
01:12:16,840 --> 01:12:19,400
I've no got a clue what she's on about. I'm just glad she's happy.

1903
01:12:20,840 --> 01:12:24,280
Get in my lobby. Imagine me saying I want a KMS and you're like, oh my god, I'm so glad she's

1904
01:12:24,280 --> 01:12:29,480
happy. No, no, no, no. I like when you go and things. I just have no clue what you're actually

1905
01:12:29,480 --> 01:12:34,520
going on about. Are you here? I'm inviting you in. Did you get that invite? Oh my god, I just,

1906
01:12:34,520 --> 01:12:39,400
I just panicked. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. The game mode isn't. Oh, I just invited you back.

1907
01:12:40,360 --> 01:12:47,320
No. Ignore me. Ignore me. Why does sin remind me of that girl from Alia? Something. Oh my god,

1908
01:12:47,320 --> 01:12:54,760
I love that. Oh my god, I love Alia. What's Alia? Yes, this new anime where like she, she's like,

1909
01:12:54,760 --> 01:12:59,160
speaks Russian when she wants to say something, you know, like, like she's like tsundere and when

1910
01:12:59,160 --> 01:13:02,200
she wants to be nice, she says it in Russian, but the guy actually doesn't understand what she's

1911
01:13:02,200 --> 01:13:07,160
saying. Oh, that's such a cute quote. Sorry, those are my favorite. She's like, I hate you. She's like,

1912
01:13:10,280 --> 01:13:21,160
That's what she says. She says dirty, dirty enjoyer of women's thighs. Oh, that's what she says.

1913
01:13:21,160 --> 01:13:25,960
I'm doing a series called Turn Me Into A Weeb where we're watching like anime for the first time.

1914
01:13:25,960 --> 01:13:30,360
I'm starting it up this month and I'm hoping it's a success because then I can be like,

1915
01:13:30,360 --> 01:13:34,840
actually, yes, I have watched that anime other than like the literally main stuff. I watched the

1916
01:13:34,840 --> 01:13:41,080
main stuff. So I can find the, yes, I watch anime because I only watched like super popular stuff,

1917
01:13:41,080 --> 01:13:45,480
which makes me a bad anime fan. There's this like new deer one out as well, which is really cute.

1918
01:13:45,480 --> 01:13:50,760
And it's like, she got, she got. Oh my god, it's so cute. The deer one. Oh, I've done it. I've

1919
01:13:50,760 --> 01:13:55,720
got the name of it though. A deer. But yeah, we're watching that. Yeah. It's like a deer and then

1920
01:13:56,680 --> 01:14:01,240
it's just so goofy. It's just the good kind of brain roll. Have you seen Happy Sugar Life?

1921
01:14:02,200 --> 01:14:07,160
No, that's the first one of mine. I'm watching anime that only have like one

1922
01:14:08,040 --> 01:14:14,440
like season. Oh my god. Did you see the Vtuber one though? It's too relevant. I've not seen it.

1923
01:14:14,440 --> 01:14:20,760
Oh, maybe we should watch that one. They have three deals in the anime. Yeah, she gets like,

1924
01:14:20,760 --> 01:14:26,760
it's about like Vtubers and she gets like, oh my god, wait, but that's literally what we did for

1925
01:14:26,760 --> 01:14:30,760
the Veeler girls. It creeps me out. It's like, oh my god, that's literally strong.

1926
01:14:32,760 --> 01:14:38,120
Literally what we did for the girls are like, if you don't have this equipment, we'll buy it for

1927
01:14:38,120 --> 01:14:42,920
you because it's imperative that you have a three deal basically. Literally, she got like,

1928
01:14:42,920 --> 01:14:49,560
she reached a sub goal or something. Wait, no, that's, that's so weird. And then she gets the

1929
01:14:49,560 --> 01:14:58,120
Japanese ear picks out for her ear. No, I need to watch that. That's amazing. So good. It's so

1930
01:14:58,120 --> 01:15:03,640
good. I'm like, oh my god. Oh, it's like, and it's just like playing like, what is that one?

1931
01:15:05,080 --> 01:15:10,360
Getting over it. Yeah, she like plays like, all the major Vtuber games is wet. No, we're so

1932
01:15:10,360 --> 01:15:14,760
watching that refling. Sorry. That sounds so good. I feel like I'm going to get like a weird like,

1933
01:15:14,760 --> 01:15:20,680
is that me? Is this anime about me for one? Never related harder to an anime in my life.

1934
01:15:21,800 --> 01:15:23,320
That wait, there's no pair for me.

1935
01:15:26,360 --> 01:15:31,960
And then how do you pronounce the gate? Stop. Stop. I was there. I was there.

1936
01:15:33,080 --> 01:15:38,680
They're like, so we're playing fortnight fortnight. We like fortnight. So then I'm like, oh,

1937
01:15:38,680 --> 01:15:43,480
that's Goku. And then they all start laughing at me. And then they type out his name and I'm like,

1938
01:15:43,800 --> 01:15:49,960
Vegeta. And then they're all like, oh, I'm like, oh, how else am I supposed to say it? That's how

1939
01:15:49,960 --> 01:15:58,920
I say it. Like, oh, oh my god. In the Vtuber anime, no, like the check looks like, like one of the

1940
01:15:59,800 --> 01:16:05,000
succubus checks literally looks like me. I'm like, what the fuck? I'm like, who knew all the succubus

1941
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:11,320
looked the same? Wait, they actually got red and silver like you? Yeah. It's a fucking milk, mommy.

1942
01:16:11,320 --> 01:16:15,240
Stop. It's you. You're literally in game. Literally, we're all in it. We're literally in

1943
01:16:15,960 --> 01:16:19,160
and it was, it was obviously based on us. Clearly that popular and famous in the anime.

1944
01:16:19,160 --> 01:16:23,480
And I was like, there's no other explanation for that. All right, go. They're dogs.

1945
01:16:24,760 --> 01:16:34,040
They're dogs. Can I pet that dog? Stop playing on my banjo. I'm strumming on my banjo for you, baby.

1946
01:16:35,240 --> 01:16:40,360
Oh my god. Cowboy Vtuber that uses. Yeah, literally, no. Cowboy Vtuber that says I'm

1947
01:16:40,360 --> 01:16:47,160
strumming on my, like I hear how it be already. Strumming on my, oh yeah, I heard that as well.

1948
01:16:47,160 --> 01:16:52,760
Fuck me. It's gone. Oh, it's me. No, no, it's me. Oh, well, I can't hear it. Yeah, you can get real

1949
01:16:52,760 --> 01:17:00,440
first. I'm off to do it again. Oh, someone got worked. She got, she got. Right, I hope I can do a

1950
01:17:00,440 --> 01:17:07,800
genuine piece. Someone says, Heyson, how do you flirt in Russian with someone? What would you say?

1951
01:17:10,600 --> 01:17:24,280
What did you say? Was it bad? I want to be a good mummy for you. No, what the heck? They dropped

1952
01:17:24,280 --> 01:17:28,760
the other person that they were. Oh my god. I've just put myself in a corner like a twat.

1953
01:17:28,760 --> 01:17:35,320
Oh my god. I'm such a twat. Sorry. I'm actually like, I'm really low IQ. I'm so sorry.

1954
01:17:36,040 --> 01:17:42,920
What is this? Oh, what is that? I don't even know what kind of killer that is or what he does.

1955
01:17:45,240 --> 01:17:48,600
Is he slow? I mean, like, it's not hot though. Like to say pee-pee, it's

1956
01:17:48,600 --> 01:17:53,640
chlen. Like, that's why I'd never make videos. It sounds like you're saying chlen. Oh yeah,

1957
01:17:53,640 --> 01:17:58,680
I want your chlen. I want your chlen so bad. Like, no, that's what I'm saying. What was that?

1958
01:17:58,680 --> 01:18:02,760
Something just came out of me. Oh, what is this? What is this? What is this piece?

1959
01:18:02,760 --> 01:18:07,960
Words for pee-pee in Russian. Stronny's like getting chased and absolutely shagged. I seem to,

1960
01:18:07,960 --> 01:18:12,920
I appear to have been reached the killer. What the fuck is this? Oh my god.

1961
01:18:14,760 --> 01:18:20,360
He looks like something of Elton Ring. Sorry. Elton Ring. What the fuck? He literally,

1962
01:18:21,160 --> 01:18:23,480
that is literally Radan. It is.

1963
01:18:26,920 --> 01:18:30,520
Oh, he felt brave going between that and that. Oh my god.

1964
01:18:32,520 --> 01:18:35,080
You just got on a hook from Radan. What the fuck? Why do you not dodge?

1965
01:18:36,040 --> 01:18:40,200
He's coming for you. I don't fuck his after me next. I do not roll over. Exactly, that's what I

1966
01:18:40,200 --> 01:18:46,600
thought. Getting on at me for no being able to dodge. She fell over. She fell over.

1967
01:18:47,480 --> 01:18:54,520
Okay, there's the, wait, because you're a girl, it's he fell over. He fell over.

1968
01:18:55,720 --> 01:19:01,240
Summoning the replants. That's the only, he's the only one for you. He's still chasing me by

1969
01:19:01,240 --> 01:19:04,920
the way, everybody. I just thought you should all know that. Oh, be la famo for people. Well,

1970
01:19:04,920 --> 01:19:08,040
the other two are still doing gen. Bruv, I think they're giving up.

1971
01:19:08,040 --> 01:19:17,960
Oh, she fell over. Isn't that an awesome little chant? It's just like, he fell over.

1972
01:19:17,960 --> 01:19:22,600
He fell over. That's it. That's literally the chant. There's nothing else. I'm living the

1973
01:19:22,600 --> 01:19:28,920
employees now. God damn it. That's what it's like. Oh my god. We have two gen. Oh my god,

1974
01:19:28,920 --> 01:19:35,720
you're in the freaking basement. I know. I'm in the worst place possible. Oh my god. We're

1975
01:19:35,720 --> 01:19:45,160
getting absolutely decimated. We're actually getting decimated. Oh my god. He had a tal,

1976
01:19:45,160 --> 01:19:49,400
what'd you call it, talisman on for Elden Ring, because what the actual frick frack,

1977
01:19:49,400 --> 01:19:56,200
crick croc is for that. Yeah, honestly, absolutely annihilated. Do you wear crocs? I've done, I've

1978
01:19:56,200 --> 01:20:01,640
never worn. Do you have a pair of crocs? I have one pair of shoes. One pair of shoes? I don't go

1979
01:20:01,720 --> 01:20:06,440
out with saints and I don't need to go anyway. I have one pair of shoes. They're trainers.

1980
01:20:06,440 --> 01:20:10,840
Well, I went to Tescos today. Oh, I'm getting saved. Oh my god, did you get the meal deals?

1981
01:20:10,840 --> 01:20:15,640
Oh my god, tell me how good Greg's is. It's been so long. I had Greg's a few weeks ago

1982
01:20:16,520 --> 01:20:25,000
and I went to Tescos today, got myself some bread. That was it.

1983
01:20:25,320 --> 01:20:31,800
Bet your bell jail, that's my link. If it looks like, tell me more about Greg, sorry, but...

1984
01:20:33,240 --> 01:20:38,200
Right, what was your go-to, Greg? It was the cheese and hamburger and then the cheese

1985
01:20:38,200 --> 01:20:44,360
bean and sausage toasty. Are you dying? I'm coming to get you. I'm coming, okay?

1986
01:20:45,480 --> 01:20:49,080
I'm more of a pizza slice kind of girl. Did you get a pizza slice from Greg?

1987
01:20:49,080 --> 01:20:52,920
Wait, did you die, die? I'm on the hook fighting for my life.

1988
01:20:52,920 --> 01:20:56,200
Right, okay, sorry, I'm coming. I don't know how to get you. I'm nearly over.

1989
01:20:56,200 --> 01:21:01,000
No, no, I'm here. I'm here. Don't give up. I'm dying. I'm feeling, even though there's a heartbeat.

1990
01:21:01,000 --> 01:21:08,200
Oh, well, we're off shit creek. Oh, she said Milashka. Oh, hello. Goodbye. Oh, dear.

1991
01:21:12,440 --> 01:21:16,360
Oh, dear. What does this mean? I don't know. I'm slamming that shit down.

1992
01:21:16,360 --> 01:21:22,360
Oh, she said, but it's herself for me. How cute. Oh, she loves me. Oh, my God,

1993
01:21:22,360 --> 01:21:26,680
he broke the pallet. I'm out. I'm out. All right, all right, all right, all right, all right.

1994
01:21:26,680 --> 01:21:32,200
I've actually got no points. I've not had a chance to do anything. Oh, my God. I have that.

1995
01:21:32,200 --> 01:21:37,480
Oh, my God, he won shots here when he's raging. Oh, my God. I'm going to be dead on hook, so you

1996
01:21:37,480 --> 01:21:43,000
might want to find the fucking A. Oh, God, he's going to find me straight away. I'm literally

1997
01:21:43,080 --> 01:21:48,040
moaning my guts out. Oh, my God. I'm already dead. Oh, I'm run. I'm already tracer.

1998
01:21:51,080 --> 01:21:56,520
What about the next? Oh, my God. We should make a dead by daylight parody of that song.

1999
01:21:57,480 --> 01:22:00,200
What about Huntress? I'm already Huntress.

2000
01:22:13,880 --> 01:22:21,640
I should have been the Huntress, God damn it. Look at you are saying her tunes.

2001
01:22:21,640 --> 01:22:26,760
Hemorrhaging. The other girl's getting chased right now. Oh, fuck, she's alive.

2002
01:22:27,560 --> 01:22:32,440
I was like, for the hatch. Oh, no, she's alive. Oh, great. I'm so disappointed. Can I hide my

2003
01:22:32,440 --> 01:22:37,080
disappointment? Oh, no, can't find the hatch yet. Is there a chance for more clubs in the future?

2004
01:22:37,160 --> 01:22:44,280
What was then? Always. Unless she keeps telling everyone that I'm on my high moons and, yeah.

2005
01:22:47,400 --> 01:22:51,000
See, I'm a cheeky. Oh, my God. Actually, little hats like an Eastern European week,

2006
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:57,320
and I like what she bought everything. Oh, my God. Oh, that's so nice. I used to eat this Polish food

2007
01:22:57,320 --> 01:23:04,040
from Teslas all the time. It was like a wee wafer thing. God, the lag is awful. Oh, the

2008
01:23:04,040 --> 01:23:09,480
shock collar. Yes, we both do have a shock collar. I was going to do a stream called,

2009
01:23:09,480 --> 01:23:13,800
Are You Smarter Than A Five Fifth Grader, but I think it can only be streamed from one POV,

2010
01:23:13,800 --> 01:23:18,760
so I don't know if you want that on your Twitch, then. No, everything's going on your hint. I'm

2011
01:23:18,760 --> 01:23:23,720
the streamer that never streams. The streamer that never streams, real. Oh, my God. You're a V

2012
01:23:23,720 --> 01:23:27,880
Twitter. You've been demoted to a V Twitter. I can't believe it. Oh, my God. The shocker part is,

2013
01:23:27,880 --> 01:23:34,360
I think I asked my Twitter just like a month ago. What? Oh, no. I barely even tweet. I don't do

2014
01:23:34,360 --> 01:23:42,600
anything. I'm shocking. I just sit in my Discord like, Hi, bye. Hi. I'm a V Discorder. That's me.

2015
01:23:42,600 --> 01:23:46,760
A V Discord streamer. That's so good. I know. I'm sorry. I don't want to stream. Like,

2016
01:23:46,760 --> 01:23:49,880
Stroney. Like, hello, Stroney streaming. Hello. Do you think I want to stream? No, I'm watching

2017
01:23:49,880 --> 01:23:53,560
Stroney. Like, fuck off. You pop up so much. I'm like, Oh, my God. I'm getting embarrassed. I'm

2018
01:23:53,560 --> 01:23:57,320
like, Oh, no. She actually sits and watching my stream. I'm always there. I'm always there. I'm

2019
01:23:57,400 --> 01:24:02,760
always watching, you know? Don't worry. I just took over this week. I didn't get to catch you

2020
01:24:02,760 --> 01:24:09,160
as much as I usually watch you, sweetie. Oh, my God. So funny. I love you. I used to call me a V

2021
01:24:09,160 --> 01:24:13,000
girl. I'm basically a Discord kitten. That's true. I just... Wait, wait. Look for Jen. Look for Jen.

2022
01:24:13,000 --> 01:24:19,080
Look for... Oh, he knows I'm here. Goodbye. Right. Look for Hatch. I'm running and you can see my footsteps.

2023
01:24:19,080 --> 01:24:24,360
And you can see your bow. You couldn't. Oh, my God. That couldn't have gone anywhere.

2024
01:24:25,320 --> 01:24:34,120
What? No, you got the nook here. It's BS. It's BS. Bro. I've got smelly armpits. Oh, my God. That's

2025
01:24:34,120 --> 01:24:39,080
absolutely scary. Sin forces us. Oh, my God. Your pheromone maxing. She's becoming more like me.

2026
01:24:40,360 --> 01:24:43,880
Oh, my God. The more I talk to Stroney, the more I just close out, you know?

2027
01:24:45,080 --> 01:24:50,200
Sorry, but that totally... That's thunder. It shouldn't have got me. Fuck off. Honestly.

2028
01:24:50,280 --> 01:24:56,120
Can we actually have a GG? I want one win before we go. I want us to hold hands as we

2029
01:24:56,120 --> 01:25:03,960
exit together. Oh, my God. Celebrate our new friend freedom. Let's you get to fuck all that game. Oh,

2030
01:25:03,960 --> 01:25:10,200
my God. Shit. Absolutely disgusting. We keep getting worried. I'm sorry. I've been

2031
01:25:10,200 --> 01:25:17,480
worried about 20 times. Kill all survivors who've reached the second to stage. Oh, I'm getting

2032
01:25:18,040 --> 01:25:22,280
stressed. Oh, my God. They had no head as well. So is we were not making it out alive. That killer

2033
01:25:22,280 --> 01:25:27,160
knows what they're doing. So is but that killer definitely knows what they're doing. Can we get

2034
01:25:27,160 --> 01:25:32,520
something to do? Okay, mommy went on Elton. That's your guy's job. That's your guy's job to do that.

2035
01:25:32,520 --> 01:25:39,960
When are you playing Elton Ring next? Come on. Me? Yeah. I'm finishing it off next month at the

2036
01:25:39,960 --> 01:25:44,360
start of next month. I'm doing like three back to back endurance rooms. So 12 hours of me yapping.

2037
01:25:45,320 --> 01:25:51,240
I'm actually pure put off. Those spider scorpions are absolutely... Oh, my God. I know what part

2038
01:25:51,240 --> 01:25:56,920
you're on about that bit before you stream sniped me in that location. That was a nice surprise.

2039
01:25:56,920 --> 01:26:01,400
And then there's this new place, this village with them. And I'm like... Oh, no. And I heard

2040
01:26:01,400 --> 01:26:07,960
there was a scorpion temple. And I'm like, I can't play this. I'm sorry. And then I'm like,

2041
01:26:07,960 --> 01:26:11,080
oh, I'm going to play Bloodborne. And I said, oh, there's spiders in it, by the way. Yeah, I mean,

2042
01:26:11,080 --> 01:26:16,760
there's a spider story in Skyrim. But I was on voice chat with you. Oh, right. Okay. I'm going

2043
01:26:16,760 --> 01:26:21,640
to tell it then. Sorry. You literally thought you had to call an ambulance. It was that bad.

2044
01:26:21,640 --> 01:26:27,480
I thought Sin got murdered unironically or like someone broke into her house or something.

2045
01:26:28,200 --> 01:26:35,320
So we were just in a discord. Nope. We're in a voice chat on Xbox. And she was playing

2046
01:26:36,200 --> 01:26:43,160
Skyrim for the first time. We were just, you know, having a talk. And we were just talking away,

2047
01:26:43,160 --> 01:26:49,480
blah, blah, blah. And then out of nowhere, the most blood curdling scream comes out of her.

2048
01:26:49,480 --> 01:26:56,200
Like, I kid you not, you could not recreate that voice actors and actresses of all time could not

2049
01:26:56,200 --> 01:27:02,680
recreate the scream that came out of her. I had no idea what was going on. I thought someone had

2050
01:27:02,680 --> 01:27:07,880
broken in. I was like, Sin, Sin, are you there? It was literally like a movie when they hear a big

2051
01:27:07,880 --> 01:27:15,080
screen. It literally fucking threw the headset down on the floor and that I'm like, Sin, Sin,

2052
01:27:15,080 --> 01:27:20,040
are you there? Are you okay? Is everything okay? And then she comes back like a couple,

2053
01:27:20,040 --> 01:27:26,920
maybe 10 minutes later, five minutes later type thing. And I'm like, what happened? Is everything

2054
01:27:26,920 --> 01:27:32,440
okay? Is everyone like, do you need police? Do you need ambulance? And she's like, oh,

2055
01:27:32,440 --> 01:27:36,920
the big spider came down from the ceiling. I'm like, the big spider came down from the

2056
01:27:36,920 --> 01:27:42,280
ceiling. And that's what produced that fucking magnificent scream. Like spiders in real life,

2057
01:27:42,280 --> 01:27:46,280
don't bother me. It's like when they turn into like nightmarish looking creatures in the Scotland,

2058
01:27:46,280 --> 01:27:50,920
like then that's when I get the book. When I can, I could hear those scorpions in the DLC,

2059
01:27:50,920 --> 01:27:55,400
like Scotland above me. And I'm like, no, I'm like, I'm actually all over. Get me the fuck off this

2060
01:27:55,960 --> 01:27:59,800
game immediately. And the worst of it is I tried to summon imps to go in and kill the

2061
01:27:59,800 --> 01:28:03,320
scorpions and it wouldn't let me summon anybody in. For some reason there's like a glitch.

2062
01:28:05,400 --> 01:28:09,000
Right, well, they better fix that before I hop on the game where I'll be swapping the game off.

2063
01:28:09,000 --> 01:28:13,160
You're going in and murdering them. I want to see you murder some fucking scorpions.

2064
01:28:13,160 --> 01:28:17,720
No, I'm not getting my hand held through games. I'm so sorry, but it brings me so much. Like,

2065
01:28:17,720 --> 01:28:23,000
I just feel so warm and gooey inside when the reflins come and now they like protect me.

2066
01:28:23,000 --> 01:28:26,760
And then they do all this stuff and they point out where items are that immensely. It feels so

2067
01:28:26,760 --> 01:28:30,760
all lovey-dovey and ooey gooey in my tummy. For you, it's all lovey-dovey and I'm spanking

2068
01:28:30,760 --> 01:28:39,960
and like, come on, kill them faster. Scarfing. Literally, I love it. And let you just feel like

2069
01:28:39,960 --> 01:28:44,280
you're an army though, like going head in to danger and it's like, are we all going to make it out?

2070
01:28:44,280 --> 01:28:49,880
I mean, you have to kiss like this is the last time. I get so sad when a reflande thing. Oh my

2071
01:28:49,880 --> 01:28:55,000
god, they've given us ruin or whatever the freaking... They let you the romantic kiss before you go

2072
01:28:55,000 --> 01:28:59,640
into battle. Oh my god, I literally clam slam them all into battle. I think it helps. Clam slam?

2073
01:28:59,640 --> 01:29:04,440
That's, so there's this move in Elden Ring where you jump up and slam on someone. So,

2074
01:29:05,560 --> 01:29:12,360
what? Is it the doctor? Yeah, it's the doctor and I just got jumpscared. Oh my god. So before

2075
01:29:12,360 --> 01:29:16,680
the pre-ritual battle when we go against a boss, I clipped it and I clam slam all the

2076
01:29:16,680 --> 01:29:22,360
reeflings to boost morale against the enemy boss. I feel so warm and gooey inside when a

2077
01:29:22,360 --> 01:29:30,040
reflande comes. Oh, did I say that in a sentence? Oh, well, yeah, quite literally, yeah. I didn't

2078
01:29:30,040 --> 01:29:34,600
realize that was my sentence. I'm sorry, I didn't think that. Yeah, yeah, some evidence of that chair.

2079
01:29:36,760 --> 01:29:40,280
I can hear her heartbeat, but he's... I keep hearing it, but I don't know if this is like

2080
01:29:41,000 --> 01:29:46,360
a fake heartbeat. It's not going away. No, it's not going away for me either,

2081
01:29:46,360 --> 01:29:53,000
but I'm doing a gen. I'm halfway done one. Yeah, I'm doing that. Me and Big Bell are doing a gen

2082
01:29:53,000 --> 01:29:56,840
right now. And then Mummy dies three seconds in the fight. Literally, I got given the crossbow,

2083
01:29:56,840 --> 01:30:02,600
which is like the best DLC weapon right now or something, if you level it up. And I kid you

2084
01:30:02,600 --> 01:30:06,680
not, I'm doing like 12 damage from across the map while like reeflings are doing like a thousand

2085
01:30:06,760 --> 01:30:14,680
again. Whoa, what was that? It does seem so much harder, though, but what doing four of them,

2086
01:30:14,680 --> 01:30:20,360
because like the boss has more HP and all that crap. I'm like, I love they can predict when the

2087
01:30:20,360 --> 01:30:26,440
boss is something they're going to switch the aggro one to. Yeah, that's quite difficult. What the f

2088
01:30:26,440 --> 01:30:34,440
are these? Is he trolling? I don't know. My gen has just been taken off. Is that a refland? I'm like

2089
01:30:34,440 --> 01:30:41,640
off my gen now because I fucked it by accident. All the gens I'm seeing right now are like shot

2090
01:30:41,640 --> 01:30:46,440
at me into two. Well, the heartbeat's really loud right now, but

2091
01:30:49,960 --> 01:30:53,400
guys, you said you gave me the whips. All right, excuse me. Excuse me.

2092
01:30:54,440 --> 01:30:59,000
What is going on with him? No, I'm not an ace. Oh, my God. Thank you for the five.

2093
01:30:59,560 --> 01:31:07,560
Thank you for the five. Unfortunately, I do nothing. I just want strunny.

2094
01:31:11,560 --> 01:31:17,000
Collab, definitely have no issues with it. Well, I was in our ears like I like that.

2095
01:31:18,360 --> 01:31:21,960
Yeah, no, 100%. I could see me doing an ASMR collab with sin. No problem.

2096
01:31:22,680 --> 01:31:27,560
I don't know if I told you on my debut, my goal is to collab with a hundred v-tubers with ASMR,

2097
01:31:27,560 --> 01:31:32,440
and I've already got like 18 right now. I just need to actually produce the damn audio. I think

2098
01:31:32,440 --> 01:31:37,880
is this guy being nice? Is it a refland? I don't know. Whatever it is, we're not doing anything.

2099
01:31:37,880 --> 01:31:43,800
Oh, like all the heroes. Or is it like a troll build that when you're like about finish,

2100
01:31:44,360 --> 01:31:49,240
it like blocks the gen off or something? I just got it. I just got the gen blocked off again.

2101
01:31:50,360 --> 01:31:55,320
Is it every time we do a gen? Wait, what? I don't know what's going on. Maybe it's when

2102
01:31:55,320 --> 01:32:01,720
you let go, it gets blocked. I've got no clue what's going on. Maybe it's just a nice killer.

2103
01:32:02,280 --> 01:32:06,840
He's stacking insanity. What what happens when insanity is max?

2104
01:32:06,840 --> 01:32:09,800
Well, we're getting closer to him. He's literally right there.

2105
01:32:11,080 --> 01:32:20,440
I can see his red light. I can't even see him at all. Make some noise. Wait, I need to snap out of it now.

2106
01:32:20,440 --> 01:32:27,560
Is he going to like one shot us and go eight shots? I don't know.

2107
01:32:28,840 --> 01:32:33,640
I'm getting nervous now. This is as he got annoyed and he's about to one shot us.

2108
01:32:33,640 --> 01:32:40,120
I think it may be annoyed. I don't I don't. I'm actually in here. He's just making heartbeat.

2109
01:32:41,800 --> 01:32:45,560
And it's still slower than my heartbeat. Actually, you should take the heart piece.

2110
01:32:45,720 --> 01:32:48,440
Bro, literally just take it from dead by daylight then.

2111
01:32:52,360 --> 01:32:55,400
I remember the first time I played dead by daylight and I heard the heartbeat and I closed

2112
01:32:55,400 --> 01:33:01,400
the game down because I got scared. I was like, I'll get scared. I just literally all F4 out the

2113
01:33:01,400 --> 01:33:06,520
game. Do you play horror games at all? No, I'm surprised you didn't play that into the deep

2114
01:33:06,520 --> 01:33:10,760
where it was called that. I'm not playing it yet. I'm not playing that yet. I'll play it soon to

2115
01:33:11,480 --> 01:33:19,240
I'll be so funny. Oh my god, it's seven. I hate scary stuff. Well, I have freaking played Halo.

2116
01:33:19,240 --> 01:33:25,320
Turns out it's actually a horror game. When the flood comes out, I was like, oh, if you're driving

2117
01:33:25,320 --> 01:33:33,080
or what? Oh, did you see that? Okay. She saw it, bro. The driving at the end was like, I was like,

2118
01:33:33,080 --> 01:33:38,680
there's just a random barrier right before the end. Halo on Legendary. Yeah, we should play

2119
01:33:38,680 --> 01:33:47,960
Lethal Company. We should. Well, there's this game called Dead Space, which is co-op. It's a horror

2120
01:33:47,960 --> 01:33:52,280
though, but I would totally play it with you if it's just both of us screaming with our heart rate

2121
01:33:52,280 --> 01:33:57,880
monitors on. Heart rate monitors. Oh fuck's sake, I had this stupid skill check. Sorry, there was

2122
01:33:57,880 --> 01:34:02,360
like a skill check and it was bouncing. Are we going to any gens left? Wait, what's going on? I'm

2123
01:34:02,440 --> 01:34:08,280
sorry, I'm stuffed with it. He's not playing. Like, surely not. I mean, at least we get our victory

2124
01:34:08,280 --> 01:34:12,040
together. I'm not complaining. At least we both get to go. I'm just like, I'm stepping in. Could

2125
01:34:12,040 --> 01:34:15,400
we just end this already? I'm going in. Some stream stip it. I did get for the win. Yeah,

2126
01:34:15,400 --> 01:34:20,200
they're like, bro, hurry up and wrap up the stream. They really won that ASMR stream right now. I need

2127
01:34:20,200 --> 01:34:24,440
to do it. I need to do a thousand kisses before I'm allowed to kill again. Oh, for something

2128
01:34:24,440 --> 01:34:30,040
I meant to cut down. A thousand. I'm forgetting steak. Stop giving me these skill checks. I'm not

2129
01:34:30,120 --> 01:34:36,120
smart enough for this. Sorry, I'm actually not. At least stop giving me them. Right, I'm about to

2130
01:34:36,120 --> 01:34:41,240
pop it. So if no ed happens, Rick, I don't know if no ed a thing or not, but if it happens, I

2131
01:34:41,240 --> 01:34:49,000
can't even find where the actual killer is. I don't know what's going on, but that totally

2132
01:34:49,000 --> 01:34:55,960
counts, right? That counts as a win, right? Yeah, we didn't ask for this. This is a win.

2133
01:34:56,520 --> 01:35:03,880
Always count. Now I can hear his heartbeat. I have no idea. Oh, no, he's just standing there.

2134
01:35:05,960 --> 01:35:10,840
Is that a reflin or an emplin? Oh, not an emplin for it. Yeah, emplin is together.

2135
01:35:10,840 --> 01:35:15,560
No, no, I was saying emplin, so I didn't have to say reflins and imps. Okay, that's smart.

2136
01:35:16,200 --> 01:35:21,880
I mean, I guess. I'll call them fucking imps. Emplins are cute though. I like them.

2137
01:35:22,040 --> 01:35:24,600
It's kind of cute. You just like add in wings and then

2138
01:35:26,360 --> 01:35:31,160
if you give me your cockling. Oh, okay, no. I've done it like if you're British,

2139
01:35:31,160 --> 01:35:37,560
you call it like a tealing and all that. I could just do like a ling-ling-ling, you know.

2140
01:35:37,560 --> 01:35:43,080
Oh, it's a new player. Oh, wait, no. What? Is that a reflin? Gigi, well played.

2141
01:35:44,040 --> 01:35:51,480
It didn't even attempt to do anything. I'm sorry if you wanted to farm. We thought you had no ed.

2142
01:35:52,680 --> 01:35:56,920
Oh, he's calling the perks on and... Yeah, like I was saying, it's not like a

2143
01:35:56,920 --> 01:36:01,000
thrill of the hunt. Blood points, so he just...

2144
01:36:04,680 --> 01:36:07,240
I'm so comfortable. I'm comfortable. Because I've been writing anything.

2145
01:36:07,240 --> 01:36:12,520
Three genuine readers are blocked for a minute and two minutes at the start of a trail.

2146
01:36:12,520 --> 01:36:16,760
That's actually pretty OP, not gonna lie. I'm gonna get strung a band.

2147
01:36:17,320 --> 01:36:21,160
What? A band? Oh, no! He typed something back, but I never saw it.

2148
01:36:21,480 --> 01:36:24,040
What is that? Wait, what? What's this? Because I'm...

2149
01:36:25,320 --> 01:36:30,040
BDAFK League... What? What does that mean? Because I'm translating?

2150
01:36:30,040 --> 01:36:34,200
I don't know. I can't see it. You can see it on your end, but I've accidentally typed one.

2151
01:36:34,200 --> 01:36:39,720
Yeah, the literature wrote like... He was farming points stacking.

2152
01:36:39,720 --> 01:36:44,120
Oh, he was farming points. But he only got 4k. He could've walloped us at the gate, to be honest.

2153
01:36:44,120 --> 01:36:46,920
And he probably got more points to actually try to get us.

2154
01:36:46,920 --> 01:36:50,040
And no, that wasn't true. I'm rather confusing.

2155
01:36:50,040 --> 01:36:55,880
An encrypted message while CSGO joined my CSGO site for some woman skins.

2156
01:36:55,880 --> 01:37:00,600
Oh my god, I remember wanting that was all the rage. That was the big YouTuber news,

2157
01:37:00,600 --> 01:37:03,000
where it was like, oh my god, all these CSGO have Gamba.

2158
01:37:05,720 --> 01:37:10,760
I'm late. No, don't worry. Right, I think we'll make this the last one and then I'm gonna prepare

2159
01:37:10,840 --> 01:37:17,640
for my ASMR stream. Oh, big stretch. Big stretch. I'm excited.

2160
01:37:19,160 --> 01:37:24,760
So basically, every time I do a membership stream, I never actually do ASMR when I've

2161
01:37:24,760 --> 01:37:29,880
called it ASMR. So my punishment is 1000 kisses. So I literally have like a kiss counter and

2162
01:37:29,880 --> 01:37:36,680
everything ready to go. So I'm gonna do 1000 kisses and then I'm allowed to talk.

2163
01:37:37,400 --> 01:37:42,280
Oh my god, I need to open my window. So very sorry, friends, hear me in the street. It's not me.

2164
01:37:42,840 --> 01:37:47,160
Oh my god, could you imagine they walk past and they're like, wait a second, I know that voice.

2165
01:37:47,160 --> 01:37:51,000
I can't hear that voice. As soon as they walk past and...

2166
01:37:52,680 --> 01:37:54,520
Oh, I'll give you a wee wave. I'll give you a wee wave.

2167
01:37:56,680 --> 01:38:01,080
The butter be flown from your lips. Now, hold on a minute. Now, hold on a minute.

2168
01:38:02,040 --> 01:38:07,400
Like, we don't enjoy the yap in 1000. I'm sure it was 10. No, apparently,

2169
01:38:07,400 --> 01:38:13,960
10,000 is like a 10 hour stream. So I think 10,000 will be like a massive milestone because

2170
01:38:13,960 --> 01:38:18,360
I can't imagine me kissing like that. Oh my god, we're gonna get carried so hard. What the fuck?

2171
01:38:18,360 --> 01:38:23,640
Yes. No, he's back down. You're so stupid. He saw the default and he was like, I'm gonna play him

2172
01:38:23,640 --> 01:38:28,600
with these noobies. Oh my god. Literally, he was like, where's his skin? You...

2173
01:38:28,840 --> 01:38:33,960
Look at the state of the state of dead by daylight right now. And it's just folk that

2174
01:38:37,880 --> 01:38:41,640
there doesn't seem to be a park. So I'm gonna just buy loads of random things in the park tree.

2175
01:38:42,120 --> 01:38:44,760
Edinburgh, are you going to... Are you going to the Edinburgh Fringe?

2176
01:38:45,960 --> 01:38:53,080
We're going to the Edinburgh Fringe Festival. Oh my. Edinburgh. Edinburgh, sweetie.

2177
01:38:53,720 --> 01:39:01,320
Real and true, Edinburgh. Glasgow. Glasgow. Yeah, anyone been to the Glasgow event?

2178
01:39:02,200 --> 01:39:06,600
The Edinburgh event? You need drip to play with me. Honestly, that's exactly what it felt like.

2179
01:39:06,600 --> 01:39:09,960
They literally were like, uh, right. No, we're not doing that. It's like all things.

2180
01:39:09,960 --> 01:39:17,320
Honestly, I don't play. Do you replay the lyrics? Wait, actually? Shut up. Actually. Oh my god.

2181
01:39:21,560 --> 01:39:25,160
Right. You need to carry us. You need to carry us on ironic glue.

2182
01:39:26,120 --> 01:39:28,760
Strangely, if you don't want to click each item in the web, you can click the last one

2183
01:39:28,760 --> 01:39:34,600
in the chain and it'll find all the ones before. What? Oh my god, these guys, we join.

2184
01:39:35,400 --> 01:39:43,320
They spin it up. No way. Right, no pressure on this one reflin, but the entire,

2185
01:39:44,200 --> 01:39:50,600
the entire stream is looking at you to get us to win. Okay? You're watching. They literally said,

2186
01:39:50,600 --> 01:39:55,240
okay, we're all dead right. It's over. It's over. You represent all the reflins right now. No pressure.

2187
01:39:55,240 --> 01:39:58,360
Yeah, you represent all the reflins. You have to let us both

2188
01:39:59,000 --> 01:40:03,480
synonize. Right, okay. By the way, just saying, just saying, not a lot, not a lot.

2189
01:40:04,440 --> 01:40:10,200
He's changed so guys. Oh, lovely. All right. He's on me already. I hear his heartbeat.

2190
01:40:10,760 --> 01:40:17,560
Please let me play. Please let me play the game. Oh my god. No way. You're down. I just cheered

2191
01:40:17,560 --> 01:40:22,040
us up as the reflins. Don't worry. The reflin's going to body block and get you off somehow with

2192
01:40:22,040 --> 01:40:27,400
all his power. Oh my god, it's a reflin that's going on the hook. Oh no. I thought he was, you know,

2193
01:40:28,520 --> 01:40:35,560
save the reflin. Oh, come on. I'm in trouble. I'm taking him away. Are you in trouble? I don't know

2194
01:40:35,560 --> 01:40:39,240
if I'm being... Okay, I'll get your little precious reflin. No, you need to save reflin. Oh my god.

2195
01:40:40,360 --> 01:40:46,440
Oh my god, he's coming for me, but not in a good way. I'll heal this. We have to get the reflin

2196
01:40:46,920 --> 01:40:52,280
selfie. I'm going back. Oh my god, leave me alone. You're scaring me. You're scaring me, killer.

2197
01:40:53,960 --> 01:41:01,160
Oh my god, stop. Mummy can only do so much and he's... Oh my god. Oh my god. The hook is right

2198
01:41:01,160 --> 01:41:07,160
there. Right, save your mummy. The reflin heals out. Like reflin, like mum, I'm literally straight on

2199
01:41:07,160 --> 01:41:13,720
the hook right after he gets off it. Oh, he's running. He's running for years. Oh my god, he's running.

2200
01:41:17,000 --> 01:41:25,160
What is that? Why does chainsaw guy look so different? They have skins now, like everything

2201
01:41:25,160 --> 01:41:29,640
has skins. Okay, I got picked up. I got picked. I'm getting healed. I'm getting healed. Oh my god,

2202
01:41:29,640 --> 01:41:34,520
group healed. I thought I was being smart, hiding behind the barrels. Anyone's true for you.

2203
01:41:36,840 --> 01:41:41,320
I didn't know you could like go through it. I'm like, that's kind of rude. Very fat and rude.

2204
01:41:41,320 --> 01:41:45,720
You open the gun, don't. It's fine. It's fine. I got this. I need to get the fuck out of here

2205
01:41:46,360 --> 01:41:53,640
because he's going to come speeding up. All the way straight back over. Is he coming to get you?

2206
01:41:55,240 --> 01:42:01,400
Okay, we have a gen done. He is away. What the fuck does that noise mean? What was that noise?

2207
01:42:02,600 --> 01:42:06,600
They need to stop with all these mysterious noises. I need a big text on screen that said

2208
01:42:06,680 --> 01:42:10,440
that noise alert was activated because of the, the, the, because all the hair goes.

2209
01:42:12,360 --> 01:42:14,600
I'm not getting healed. Oh, I'm getting healed by speed demon.

2210
01:42:16,040 --> 01:42:22,520
Dave by D-like. I just flipped on my ass and I put it up.

2211
01:42:25,480 --> 01:42:30,280
No, the, you know, I heard the fortnight song. It's like fortnight. Oh, here it was that you

2212
01:42:30,280 --> 01:42:34,760
bled out your ass after getting chased and they want. No, no, no, no, no, no. No, it was overdraft.

2213
01:42:34,760 --> 01:42:39,720
You gotta check it though. They have, can the killer be faster? They're already faster than us.

2214
01:42:40,520 --> 01:42:42,040
They make them more faster.

2215
01:42:44,920 --> 01:42:50,600
Bro, this game, honestly, don't be a shite. Like, this game is so mean.

2216
01:42:52,840 --> 01:42:55,080
You just don't want to see us have a fair and square dog.

2217
01:42:59,080 --> 01:43:02,680
Right. I'm doing the one in the middle. I'm going to try to get healed. Please. Can you heal?

2218
01:43:02,680 --> 01:43:06,840
Okay. Gens are more important than my heels. Oh, no, he sees me. Oh, oh, no, he doesn't. Oh,

2219
01:43:06,840 --> 01:43:12,280
he's after speed demon. Has he been on the hook yet? So unironically, that might actually be the

2220
01:43:12,280 --> 01:43:18,840
best thing. I think I might be the next target because I'm in your morning. I can see you richer.

2221
01:43:20,120 --> 01:43:25,720
Damn. There's a perk that calls him to speed up. Hillbilly can run even faster, but he can't turn

2222
01:43:25,720 --> 01:43:33,560
properly, meaning you can dodge. Come on, use your Elton Ring skills to dodge. I guess it's safe.

2223
01:43:34,520 --> 01:43:40,520
Right. Reflin's going to his rescue. I'm just doing the gen. Oh my god. Thank you. Thank you.

2224
01:43:43,160 --> 01:43:45,960
But I didn't know he could do that. I didn't know he could do that.

2225
01:43:45,960 --> 01:43:53,320
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

2226
01:43:55,800 --> 01:44:01,000
I'm just can't believe doing a jet. Oh my god. If you finish that gen, you guys might be able to get

2227
01:44:01,000 --> 01:44:09,800
out. Oh my god. My little heart is beating right now. Oh my god. Thank you. Crow the Egypt for

2228
01:44:09,800 --> 01:44:18,120
becoming a member. And Egypt means... Oh my god. I can't believe I did that. That scared me so

2229
01:44:18,120 --> 01:44:23,160
much. You've got to break the line of sight with Big Billy. Right. I'll remember. Don't be silly.

2230
01:44:23,160 --> 01:44:29,640
My uncle Billy had a ten-foot belly. In the next door, he snuck into the door.

2231
01:44:32,760 --> 01:44:36,920
I can't believe you remember that. I hardly remember it myself. Classic. Classic. Oh my god.

2232
01:44:37,080 --> 01:44:42,840
Better be open in the door. Don't be silly. I didn't like your... Actually, don't be silly.

2233
01:44:42,840 --> 01:44:49,080
And object your willy. Something you didn't like. Oh my god. Oh my god. Oh my god. Oh my god.

2234
01:44:49,080 --> 01:44:53,880
Reflin is down. I repeat. Reflin is down. Oh no. Hen, you know what to do. I'm self-healing. I'm

2235
01:44:53,880 --> 01:44:57,880
self-healing. I'm using my med kit, and then I'm going to save Reflin. Reflin's down. Reflin's down.

2236
01:44:58,920 --> 01:45:05,000
I'm at only... Oh my god. Why is the heartbeat getting louder? Reflin, I might have fucked

2237
01:45:05,000 --> 01:45:12,740
up horrifically. No, no, no, I got you. Let me save you. Let me touch your armpits. I'm

2238
01:45:12,740 --> 01:45:17,180
going to tickle you tickle, tickle, tickle. Okay, I need to self weak. Can you hear me?

2239
01:45:17,180 --> 01:45:29,220
Maybe not. If you hear me, it'll be faster. Oh, I'm tickling. I have bought any knowledge.

2240
01:45:29,220 --> 01:45:34,540
So my healing is a bit faster than the average do. And then we'll do this Jen and then that'll

2241
01:45:34,540 --> 01:45:38,140
be one done and since we've got the other one, and then we'll get out and we'll all escape

2242
01:45:38,140 --> 01:45:42,940
and somehow stay alive again. I had to stop because speed demon got wrecked. I had to

2243
01:45:42,940 --> 01:45:47,740
run. Wait, is this done? Oh, Jen is done. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Mummy's special needs.

2244
01:45:47,740 --> 01:45:57,680
Um, rellis. Oh, that's not good. That's not good. It's not good. No, it's not. And I'm

2245
01:45:57,680 --> 01:46:03,400
dead when I go on the hook next time. Ripped. I don't know. You know what? Should we just

2246
01:46:04,400 --> 01:46:12,260
I mean, when were the reflins getting chased right now? Actually, not to be. I don't know

2247
01:46:12,260 --> 01:46:16,540
if I should go for the save. I don't know. Right. You stay on that gym. You stay on

2248
01:46:16,540 --> 01:46:23,500
the gym. I'll go for the save. She says she approaches this fucking table. Oh my God.

2249
01:46:23,500 --> 01:46:32,780
Oh my, I think it's too late. Oh my God. It's too late. It's too late to roll. If I die,

2250
01:46:32,800 --> 01:46:37,600
this might work out. If I die because it means you can get the hatch out and then it means

2251
01:46:37,600 --> 01:46:44,080
refling and I are together forever. You guys are just wait. He's right at your heartbeat.

2252
01:46:44,080 --> 01:46:49,680
I don't know. Is it going for you? He shouldn't you? He's. Oh my God. Refling sacrificed himself

2253
01:46:49,680 --> 01:46:55,720
for us. No, he's away. Oh my God. He's away in the sky now. Make sure it's not in vain

2254
01:46:55,720 --> 01:47:02,720
now. Hey, no pressure. No pressure. No pressure. I got Jen down. He's probably gonna go for

2255
01:47:02,940 --> 01:47:06,940
me. You got this one done. Right. Good. I don't know where the other one is. I'm running

2256
01:47:06,940 --> 01:47:12,820
from my fucking line. I'm scared. Yeah, he's actually coming. There's chainsaw. Oh my

2257
01:47:12,820 --> 01:47:19,820
God. Hide behind a rock. I'm hiding behind a rock right now. I hope he doesn't bite me.

2258
01:47:19,820 --> 01:47:25,980
Okay, I'm just starting a random generator. Although, speed demon's on it. Wait, is he

2259
01:47:26,120 --> 01:47:33,120
still alive? I saved him. I'm dead on hooks. Don't worry. I'm gonna die when I go on

2260
01:47:38,440 --> 01:47:44,440
hook. I'm gonna go join my refling in the ether. Okay, so we can be together. Whatever.

2261
01:47:44,440 --> 01:47:51,440
And then I'll spectate you. Is he dead? Is he away in a manger? Away in a manger. What

2262
01:47:56,040 --> 01:48:01,040
fucking soul is away in a manger? You're literally, it's you and the other guy's getting chased

2263
01:48:01,040 --> 01:48:06,040
right now. Oh wait, he's alive? Okay. I don't know if it's me. I just wasted my speed version.

2264
01:48:06,040 --> 01:48:11,040
You're screwed. All right, are you supposed to stay again then? Oh my God, wait, what?

2265
01:48:11,040 --> 01:48:18,040
He's doing the gen. Speed demon's a five head? Wait, so he's coming over to you now, but

2266
01:48:19,080 --> 01:48:22,080
speed demon's about to finish a gen. I'm not even kidding. You might be able to do the

2267
01:48:22,180 --> 01:48:28,180
gate. I'm not gonna do the gen then. No, look. Oh my God. And you get healed up because of

2268
01:48:28,180 --> 01:48:32,180
adrenaline. You five head. Is he heading? Or is he heading for me? He's going back to the,

2269
01:48:32,180 --> 01:48:37,180
I don't know. Oh no, I hear him. I hear him. Oh no. Yeah, right. Okay. Oh my God. Is he

2270
01:48:37,180 --> 01:48:42,180
purple? Oh no. Yeah, he's pink for you as well. Okay, that's fine. Speed demon's physical.

2271
01:48:42,180 --> 01:48:47,180
Don't vomit. It's okay. We need to root this in. Okay, so Dwight is currently opening

2272
01:48:47,180 --> 01:48:51,420
the den. One door. One door is currently being a little bit open. You might want to make

2273
01:48:51,480 --> 01:48:56,480
a move to find a gate. You can run. He's down here, but I know he's down here. Oh no, he's

2274
01:48:56,480 --> 01:49:01,480
in trouble. Oh my God, he's doing jukes. Call him Daisy because he's doing jukes right now.

2275
01:49:01,480 --> 01:49:06,480
I know that's not how to work. Wait, wait, he's sprinted away. Careful. No, no, no, no,

2276
01:49:06,480 --> 01:49:11,480
no. Pause. Hide. Don't. Shit. I don't know if he saw your track marks. I don't know if

2277
01:49:11,480 --> 01:49:16,480
you can see your track marks. Oh no, he's going back. He's going back. No, no, no. Open now.

2278
01:49:16,540 --> 01:49:23,440
He's going for Dwight. He's going for Dwight. Open now. I'm really nervous. No. Oh my God,

2279
01:49:23,440 --> 01:49:27,220
he's coming back. He's coming back. Hide hide hide hide hide. Oh no, no, he's not, he's not,

2280
01:49:27,220 --> 01:49:29,740
he's not. He's picking up the Dwight. He's picking up the Dwight. Wait, he's moved.

2281
01:49:29,740 --> 01:49:34,040
I can't see him. I don't know if he's coming back. I can't see him. I think he's coming

2282
01:49:34,040 --> 01:49:38,420
for you. I think he's coming. You need to move. I don't know. I need your yo... Oh my

2283
01:49:38,420 --> 01:49:44,040
God, you're YOLO-ing. Oh my God, you're YOLO-ing. Stop. I think you may do it. I think you

2284
01:49:44,040 --> 01:50:03,040
Oh my god, that's perfect. Oh my god, that was too close. My cheeks are clenched. Oh my god. I need to relax. Oh my god, that was too close.

2285
01:50:03,040 --> 01:50:19,040
Oh my god, we did it. What are we to end it? Sin made it. We did it. Did we win? We got the dub because Sin managed to get out. We got the dub. That's all we wanted. That was scary. That was terrifying.

2286
01:50:20,040 --> 01:50:25,040
Right. Do you want to plug yourself to The Reefland?

2287
01:50:26,040 --> 01:50:30,040
As what? What? No, plug it.

2288
01:50:34,040 --> 01:50:39,040
I don't stream. What's happening to show? I'm going to finish up for myself. I'll put you on the stream.

2289
01:50:39,040 --> 01:50:41,040
I'll catch you on Stony's chat next stream when I'm watching.

2290
01:50:41,040 --> 01:50:43,040
So, that's so true though.

2291
01:50:44,040 --> 01:50:47,040
Are you playing tomorrow? You collab with Ace, isn't it?

2292
01:50:47,040 --> 01:50:48,040
Yes, we do.

2293
01:50:48,040 --> 01:50:51,040
Ace collab week for me. I'm being so social this week. I'm not normally social.

2294
01:50:51,040 --> 01:50:53,040
I'll plug myself and see you tomorrow.

2295
01:50:53,040 --> 01:50:54,040
Alright, there you go.

2296
01:50:54,040 --> 01:50:57,040
Alright, there you go. There you go.

2297
01:50:57,040 --> 01:51:01,040
Thank you for surviving with me, even though the whole point of the stream was to play the 4v8.

2298
01:51:01,040 --> 01:51:02,040
Declenched, yes.

2299
01:51:02,040 --> 01:51:04,040
Declenched my cheeks.

2300
01:51:04,040 --> 01:51:07,040
Look how jiggly you are compared to me, bruv.

2301
01:51:07,040 --> 01:51:09,040
Jiggly? No, let's see. No.

2302
01:51:09,040 --> 01:51:11,040
Let's enhance.

2303
01:51:13,040 --> 01:51:16,040
And the fucking jiggle physics on that is way over.

2304
01:51:16,040 --> 01:51:20,040
How much did you pay? Am I allowed to insider knowledge? How much was the toggle?

2305
01:51:20,040 --> 01:51:23,040
I literally don't even remember. It was like...

2306
01:51:23,040 --> 01:51:26,040
Well, I wasn't the cheapest in the world, I guess.

2307
01:51:26,040 --> 01:51:30,040
Yeah, yeah. I mean, I can't even remember.

2308
01:51:30,040 --> 01:51:33,040
You got three infants or two?

2309
01:51:34,040 --> 01:51:36,040
Where's the toggle?

2310
01:51:36,040 --> 01:51:40,040
Oh, the toggle. Ah, there it is. I knew it. I freaking knew it.

2311
01:51:40,040 --> 01:51:42,040
I fucking knew it.

2312
01:51:42,040 --> 01:51:45,040
I knew she had another toggle.

2313
01:51:45,040 --> 01:51:48,040
I knew it. Yeah, there it is. That's what I remember.

2314
01:51:48,040 --> 01:51:51,040
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

2315
01:51:51,040 --> 01:51:53,040
Okay, let's wait a few overlands.

2316
01:51:53,040 --> 01:51:55,040
I'm de-jating right now. Oh my God, the buttons again.

2317
01:51:55,040 --> 01:51:58,040
Oh, oh, oh.

2318
01:51:58,040 --> 01:52:02,040
Oh my God, that's a good one. Oh my God, you got your tummy pierced? I didn't know.

2319
01:52:02,040 --> 01:52:04,040
Oh my god, actual tummy piercing.

2320
01:52:04,040 --> 01:52:05,040
That's so cute!

2321
01:52:05,040 --> 01:52:06,040
You can let my belly flint.

2322
01:52:06,040 --> 01:52:08,040
And you're we- oh, oh.

2323
01:52:08,040 --> 01:52:12,040
And your ears are pierced as well.

2324
01:52:12,040 --> 01:52:15,040
What can I say, my rebel? I'm an absolute rebel.

2325
01:52:15,040 --> 01:52:18,040
Can I just appreciate her model? It's just so good. I love it.

2326
01:52:18,040 --> 01:52:19,040
I love the hair toggles as well.

2327
01:52:19,040 --> 01:52:22,040
She can make her hair longer, shorter, and do the bunches and that.

2328
01:52:22,040 --> 01:52:25,040
Oh my god, did someone say symmetrical bunches? 10 out of 10 designs.

2329
01:52:25,040 --> 01:52:28,040
Those are actual 10 out of 10 designs.

2330
01:52:28,040 --> 01:52:30,040
I know, imagine having bunches, imagine.

2331
01:52:30,040 --> 01:52:31,040
Imagine, imagine having double bunches.

2332
01:52:31,040 --> 01:52:33,040
Imagine having like a bunch of bunches.

2333
01:52:33,040 --> 01:52:36,040
Imagine having to be fringe, bangs, bangs.

2334
01:52:36,040 --> 01:52:40,040
I have three singular bangs, I feel like I'm on design.

2335
01:52:40,040 --> 01:52:43,040
Oh, you have it as well though, you have three bangs as well, technically.

2336
01:52:43,040 --> 01:52:44,040
Because of the way you look.

2337
01:52:44,040 --> 01:52:45,040
Mine's also symmetrical though.

2338
01:52:47,040 --> 01:52:49,040
I hope you all enjoyed this stream.

2339
01:52:49,040 --> 01:52:50,040
Are you going to say a little collab?

2340
01:52:50,040 --> 01:52:51,040
Yes.

2341
01:52:51,040 --> 01:52:52,040
Did you enjoy it everyone?

2342
01:52:52,040 --> 01:52:53,040
And plings?

2343
01:52:53,040 --> 01:52:59,040
And plings, don't be surprised if we see Sin coming back on at all.

2344
01:52:59,040 --> 01:53:02,040
Please don't be surprised because I think we're going to do,

2345
01:53:02,040 --> 01:53:04,040
we're going to try and win at Who's Smart,

2346
01:53:04,040 --> 01:53:07,040
Who's Smart is in a fifth grader and we'll both have shot colors on.

2347
01:53:07,040 --> 01:53:09,040
So that would be fun.

2348
01:53:09,040 --> 01:53:10,040
And that would be a good thing.

2349
01:53:10,040 --> 01:53:12,040
Don't say I'm ridiculous, my milkers look though in this.

2350
01:53:12,040 --> 01:53:13,040
Wait, show us.

2351
01:53:13,040 --> 01:53:15,040
Oh my god, Sin.

2352
01:53:15,040 --> 01:53:17,040
You pick your salad.

2353
01:53:18,040 --> 01:53:20,040
Oh my god.

2354
01:53:21,040 --> 01:53:22,040
Oh my god.

2355
01:53:22,040 --> 01:53:25,040
Wait, every time you go down and bring them up.

2356
01:53:25,040 --> 01:53:27,040
Bruh.

2357
01:53:27,040 --> 01:53:28,040
They get bigger.

2358
01:53:28,040 --> 01:53:31,040
They get even bigger when they go down and up.

2359
01:53:31,040 --> 01:53:34,040
Oh my god, that's ridiculous.

2360
01:53:35,040 --> 01:53:37,040
That is amazing.

2361
01:53:37,040 --> 01:53:38,040
Oh my god.

2362
01:53:38,040 --> 01:53:40,040
Split my chin open.

2363
01:53:40,040 --> 01:53:42,040
Bruh, how are they not smacking you in the face

2364
01:53:42,040 --> 01:53:44,040
and smacking down your knees and one face?

2365
01:53:44,040 --> 01:53:45,040
I know.

2366
01:53:45,040 --> 01:53:47,040
I was like, ah, something in my face.

2367
01:53:49,040 --> 01:53:50,040
Definitely because we can get it.

2368
01:53:50,040 --> 01:53:52,040
I can't imagine how you can be easy.

2369
01:53:52,040 --> 01:53:55,040
Remember to tune in to Strone's ASMR.

2370
01:53:55,040 --> 01:53:57,040
Member Streams.

2371
01:53:57,040 --> 01:54:00,040
I'm going to, yeah, I thought you said 10,000.

2372
01:54:00,040 --> 01:54:03,040
I was like, nope, I'm going to die of the 10,000.

2373
01:54:03,040 --> 01:54:06,040
Right, we little reeflings or implings,

2374
01:54:06,040 --> 01:54:10,040
we are going to say thank you so, so much for

2375
01:54:10,040 --> 01:54:13,040
Sin sister for showing up.

2376
01:54:13,040 --> 01:54:15,040
She does stream on Twitch when she does stream on Twitch.

2377
01:54:15,040 --> 01:54:16,040
You know what I'm saying?

2378
01:54:16,040 --> 01:54:18,040
So you can't fall into it once a year.

2379
01:54:18,040 --> 01:54:19,040
Okay.

2380
01:54:19,040 --> 01:54:22,040
But she does actually stream when she streams.

2381
01:54:22,040 --> 01:54:25,040
Which is a sentence, yeah, so it's technically not wrong.

2382
01:54:25,040 --> 01:54:27,040
She does have a Twitter, but she didn't use it either.

2383
01:54:27,040 --> 01:54:30,040
So if you want Sin updates, feel free to like and subscribe to me

2384
01:54:30,040 --> 01:54:32,040
when she pops into chat and blocks with her boob.

2385
01:54:32,040 --> 01:54:34,040
Literally, she almost like,

2386
01:54:34,040 --> 01:54:36,040
muted someone with her boob yesterday or something.

2387
01:54:36,040 --> 01:54:38,040
In the middle of the stream.

2388
01:54:38,040 --> 01:54:41,040
No, that was in the middle of the stream.

2389
01:54:41,040 --> 01:54:42,040
Yeah, my phone fell on my neck,

2390
01:54:42,040 --> 01:54:43,040
and then somebody's name was,

2391
01:54:43,040 --> 01:54:45,040
I was like, oh my god, I just banned something.

2392
01:54:45,040 --> 01:54:46,040
I'm actually, no.

2393
01:54:46,040 --> 01:54:48,040
Getting banned by a boob.

2394
01:54:48,040 --> 01:54:49,040
That only happens at Veiler,

2395
01:54:49,040 --> 01:54:51,040
so don't be afraid to like and subscribe.

2396
01:54:51,040 --> 01:54:53,040
Bye, everyone.

2397
01:54:53,040 --> 01:54:54,040
Okay, bye-bye.

2398
01:54:54,040 --> 01:54:56,040
Thank you so much for coming.

2399
01:54:56,040 --> 01:54:57,040
Bye, guys.

2400
01:54:57,040 --> 01:54:58,040
I'm going to end broadcast.

2401
01:54:58,040 --> 01:55:00,040
Oh wait, no, I'm going to redirect.

2402
01:55:00,040 --> 01:55:01,040
Is someone live right now?

2403
01:55:01,040 --> 01:55:03,040
Is there another Veiler member live?

2404
01:55:03,040 --> 01:55:06,040
If not, then user going nowhere.

2405
01:55:06,040 --> 01:55:08,040
Right, there's not another Veiler.

2406
01:55:08,040 --> 01:55:09,040
Sheepsters, come on.

2407
01:55:09,040 --> 01:55:11,040
Sheeby, Cotton, Boo.

2408
01:55:11,040 --> 01:55:14,040
Thanks for your welcome in the chat, everyone.

2409
01:55:14,040 --> 01:55:16,040
Thank you, everyone, to let me start

2410
01:55:16,040 --> 01:55:18,040
in your mummy stream today.

2411
01:55:18,040 --> 01:55:19,040
Oh, no, I don't.

2412
01:55:19,040 --> 01:55:23,040
Feature, featured, directed by Sun Sister.

2413
01:55:23,040 --> 01:55:25,040
Oh, she's not talking about me.

2414
01:55:25,040 --> 01:55:26,040
I should probably go now.

2415
01:55:26,040 --> 01:55:27,040
Okay.

2416
01:55:27,040 --> 01:55:28,040
Right, bye, Sun.

2417
01:55:28,040 --> 01:55:29,040
Thank you so much.

2418
01:55:29,040 --> 01:55:30,040
I'll message you after.

2419
01:55:30,040 --> 01:55:31,040
Bye.

2420
01:55:31,040 --> 01:55:32,040
Bye-bye.

2421
01:55:32,040 --> 01:55:33,040
Oh, no, she's going to be,

2422
01:55:33,040 --> 01:55:35,040
she's probably going to be in the Veature video thing.

2423
01:55:35,040 --> 01:55:37,040
You're going to be able to see her move around after this.

2424
01:55:37,040 --> 01:55:39,040
She's ended the call.

2425
01:55:39,040 --> 01:55:41,040
Oh, she's sticking her tongue out.

2426
01:55:41,040 --> 01:55:42,040
Oh, she's, all right.

2427
01:55:42,040 --> 01:55:43,040
Okay.

2428
01:55:43,040 --> 01:55:44,040
Yeah, she's moving about.

2429
01:55:44,040 --> 01:55:45,040
She's still hearing us.

2430
01:55:45,040 --> 01:55:46,040
Skyrim Co-op when?

2431
01:55:46,040 --> 01:55:48,040
Is there a Skyrim mod for Co-op?

2432
01:55:48,040 --> 01:55:50,040
Is Emi coming on later?

2433
01:55:50,040 --> 01:55:52,040
Emi Vee-joo.

2434
01:55:52,040 --> 01:55:54,040
I love typing in everyone's name,

2435
01:55:54,040 --> 01:55:57,040
so it's just a satisfying being a guy.

2436
01:55:57,040 --> 01:56:00,040
Just give me one more chance.

2437
01:56:05,040 --> 01:56:06,040
Oh, she's in ASMR.

2438
01:56:06,040 --> 01:56:08,040
She don't want ASMR in her new outfit.

2439
01:56:08,040 --> 01:56:10,040
She looks so cute in that outfit, seriously.

2440
01:56:10,040 --> 01:56:11,040
I can't take it.

2441
01:56:11,040 --> 01:56:12,040
She's so cute.

2442
01:56:12,040 --> 01:56:13,040
Right.

2443
01:56:13,040 --> 01:56:15,040
I'm going to redirect into Emi's stream,

2444
01:56:15,040 --> 01:56:16,040
which is two hours away.

2445
01:56:16,040 --> 01:56:17,040
In the stronghold, it's two hours away.

2446
01:56:17,040 --> 01:56:18,040
I know.

2447
01:56:18,040 --> 01:56:19,040
I know.

2448
01:56:19,040 --> 01:56:20,040
I'm aware.

2449
01:56:20,040 --> 01:56:21,040
But you're having to tolerate it.

2450
01:56:21,040 --> 01:56:22,040
Okay.

2451
01:56:22,040 --> 01:56:24,040
Because, ah, she's still dancing and gyrating

2452
01:56:24,040 --> 01:56:25,040
in the corner of my eye.

2453
01:56:25,040 --> 01:56:26,040
I'm trying to set-

2454
01:56:26,040 --> 01:56:28,040
Great collab love to see you both together.

2455
01:56:28,040 --> 01:56:29,040
Yeah.

2456
01:56:29,040 --> 01:56:31,040
Thank you so much.

2457
01:56:31,040 --> 01:56:33,040
Thank you, Tiny Spiny, anonymous,

2458
01:56:33,040 --> 01:56:35,040
bleeding, refilling Senpai, not Alessandro

2459
01:56:35,040 --> 01:56:38,040
and L Jeff for all the love shown.

2460
01:56:38,040 --> 01:56:41,040
I'm so sorry if I kind of patched it a wee bit.

2461
01:56:41,040 --> 01:56:42,040
Just, I'll try.

2462
01:56:42,040 --> 01:56:43,040
Try.

2463
01:56:43,040 --> 01:56:44,040
Okay.

2464
01:56:44,040 --> 01:56:45,040
But thank you.

2465
01:56:45,040 --> 01:56:46,040
Yes.

2466
01:56:46,040 --> 01:56:48,040
Definitely don't be surprised if Sen shows up on my channel

2467
01:56:48,040 --> 01:56:50,040
again because she's doing her thing.

2468
01:56:50,040 --> 01:56:51,040
Oh, she's done it.

2469
01:56:51,040 --> 01:56:52,040
Right.

2470
01:56:52,040 --> 01:56:54,040
We're going to redirect into Emi's thing.

2471
01:56:54,040 --> 01:56:55,040
For those of you who are a member,

2472
01:56:55,040 --> 01:56:58,040
I am going to take a five minute break to go for a pee

2473
01:56:58,040 --> 01:56:59,040
and make a cup of tea.

2474
01:56:59,040 --> 01:57:01,040
And then I am not allowed to talk until I've done

2475
01:57:01,040 --> 01:57:02,040
1,000 kisses.

2476
01:57:02,040 --> 01:57:03,040
Okay.

2477
01:57:03,040 --> 01:57:06,040
So there is a membership ASMR about to come up.

2478
01:57:06,040 --> 01:57:07,040
Okay.

2479
01:57:07,040 --> 01:57:08,040
I will behave.

2480
01:57:08,040 --> 01:57:09,040
I will behave.

2481
01:57:09,040 --> 01:57:11,040
It would be sensational.

2482
01:57:15,040 --> 01:57:16,040
It would be.

2483
01:57:16,040 --> 01:57:17,040
It would be.

2484
01:57:17,040 --> 01:57:18,040
Oh my God.

2485
01:57:18,040 --> 01:57:19,040
She has so many good toggles.

2486
01:57:19,040 --> 01:57:21,040
I didn't appreciate how good her model is until she's

2487
01:57:21,040 --> 01:57:23,040
like toe and toe right next to me.

2488
01:57:23,040 --> 01:57:24,040
No yapping.

2489
01:57:24,040 --> 01:57:25,040
Yeah.

2490
01:57:25,040 --> 01:57:26,040
See you in a bit.

2491
01:57:26,040 --> 01:57:27,040
So give me five minutes.

2492
01:57:27,040 --> 01:57:29,040
As I said, and then we'll get to it.

2493
01:57:29,040 --> 01:57:30,040
Oh, relax.

2494
01:57:30,040 --> 01:57:31,040
I'm listening.

2495
01:57:31,040 --> 01:57:32,040
Thank you for the game.

2496
01:57:32,040 --> 01:57:33,040
Thank you for the game.

2497
01:57:33,040 --> 01:57:34,040
Bro, we both died.

2498
01:57:34,040 --> 01:57:35,040
Don't.

2499
01:57:35,040 --> 01:57:36,040
We both perished.

2500
01:57:36,040 --> 01:57:37,040
Okay.

2501
01:57:37,040 --> 01:57:38,040
Thank you so much.

2502
01:57:38,040 --> 01:57:40,040
Reluctantly same for the tip as well.

2503
01:57:40,040 --> 01:57:42,040
I can't believe you managed to stream snipe.

2504
01:57:42,040 --> 01:57:44,040
And honestly, I can't believe any reflin managed to get in

2505
01:57:44,040 --> 01:57:47,040
the game because I think it was picking Aussie servers.

2506
01:57:47,040 --> 01:57:49,040
She even has tonsils.

2507
01:57:49,040 --> 01:57:52,040
Does she open your mouth soon?

2508
01:57:52,040 --> 01:57:54,040
I don't have tonsils.

2509
01:57:54,040 --> 01:57:55,040
Open your mouth.

2510
01:57:55,040 --> 01:57:56,040
Wait.

2511
01:57:56,040 --> 01:57:57,040
Hold on.

2512
01:57:57,040 --> 01:57:58,040
Let me analyze.

2513
01:57:58,040 --> 01:58:00,040
I'm going to be her dentist for a second.

2514
01:58:00,040 --> 01:58:02,040
Oh my God.

2515
01:58:02,040 --> 01:58:05,040
What the heck?

2516
01:58:05,040 --> 01:58:08,040
She has tonsils.

2517
01:58:08,040 --> 01:58:09,040
That's amazing.

2518
01:58:09,040 --> 01:58:10,040
Oh my God.

2519
01:58:10,040 --> 01:58:11,040
She has hypnotized type.

2520
01:58:11,040 --> 01:58:14,040
It's like, God, look at the detail in her iris as well.

2521
01:58:14,040 --> 01:58:15,040
That's it.

2522
01:58:15,040 --> 01:58:16,040
Oh my God.

2523
01:58:16,040 --> 01:58:17,040
We both have fangs.

2524
01:58:17,040 --> 01:58:24,040
I look like the sinister sister in the background where you're dating her and I'm the big sister

2525
01:58:24,040 --> 01:58:27,040
that's going to make it hell because you're dating her.

2526
01:58:27,040 --> 01:58:28,040
That's fine.

2527
01:58:28,040 --> 01:58:29,040
I like you.

2528
01:58:29,040 --> 01:58:30,040
Oh my God.

2529
01:58:30,040 --> 01:58:31,040
Sorry.

2530
01:58:32,040 --> 01:58:35,040
Can we all appreciate her model?

2531
01:58:35,040 --> 01:58:37,040
I'm coming closer behind her.

2532
01:58:37,040 --> 01:58:38,040
She literally has a uvula.

2533
01:58:38,040 --> 01:58:39,040
How detailed is that?

2534
01:58:39,040 --> 01:58:40,040
Oh no.

2535
01:58:40,040 --> 01:58:42,040
I know what I want next.

2536
01:58:42,040 --> 01:58:43,040
Right.

2537
01:58:43,040 --> 01:58:45,040
I'm going to get going.

2538
01:58:45,040 --> 01:58:46,040
Thank you so, so much, Sin.

2539
01:58:46,040 --> 01:58:49,040
And thank you for the reflin and the impling.

2540
01:58:49,040 --> 01:58:51,040
Oh, imps and implings that showed up.

2541
01:58:51,040 --> 01:58:53,040
It's very cute when you two come together.

2542
01:58:53,040 --> 01:58:54,040
Okay.

2543
01:58:54,040 --> 01:58:56,040
I'm sure that collarbone is physics as well.

2544
01:58:56,040 --> 01:58:57,040
Fuck's sake.

2545
01:58:57,040 --> 01:58:58,040
She has such a detailed model.

2546
01:58:58,040 --> 01:58:59,040
God damn.

2547
01:58:59,040 --> 01:59:01,040
Let me ask her how much you paid for that.

2548
01:59:01,040 --> 01:59:02,040
Neurons activated.

2549
01:59:02,040 --> 01:59:04,040
Get ready for a whole lot of not talking.

2550
01:59:04,040 --> 01:59:05,040
Exactly.

2551
01:59:05,040 --> 01:59:07,040
Why is Johnny on Sin's stream real?

2552
01:59:07,040 --> 01:59:14,040
I probably reignited her flame for one to stream a wee bit more because she's so nice.

2553
01:59:14,040 --> 01:59:17,040
She's like, oh my God, when I watch you stream, I want to stream.

2554
01:59:17,040 --> 01:59:20,040
And I'm like, yeah, yeah, I inspire you.

2555
01:59:20,040 --> 01:59:25,040
Like I'm whispering in her ear, you want to stream so bad.

2556
01:59:25,040 --> 01:59:27,040
You want to stream so bad.

2557
01:59:31,040 --> 01:59:33,040
We're fucking talking.

2558
01:59:33,040 --> 01:59:34,040
Okay.

2559
01:59:34,040 --> 01:59:35,040
I will see you very shortly.

2560
01:59:35,040 --> 01:59:37,040
We're feeling in membership stream for those of you.

2561
01:59:37,040 --> 01:59:39,040
You can redirect it into Emmy.

2562
01:59:39,040 --> 01:59:41,040
And she comes up in two hours.

2563
01:59:41,040 --> 01:59:42,040
Yes.

2564
01:59:42,040 --> 01:59:43,040
I'm making you wait two hours.

2565
01:59:43,040 --> 01:59:44,040
Bye.

2566
01:59:44,040 --> 01:59:45,040
I'll see you very shortly.

2567
01:59:45,040 --> 01:59:46,040
Bye-bye.

2568
01:59:46,040 --> 01:59:47,040
I'll be two minutes to set up.

2569
01:59:47,040 --> 01:59:48,040
Okay.

2570
01:59:48,040 --> 01:59:49,040
Because I need to swap around the microphones and stuff.

2571
01:59:49,040 --> 01:59:50,040
Bye.

2572
01:59:50,040 --> 01:59:51,040
See you later.

2573
01:59:51,040 --> 01:59:52,040
Bye.
