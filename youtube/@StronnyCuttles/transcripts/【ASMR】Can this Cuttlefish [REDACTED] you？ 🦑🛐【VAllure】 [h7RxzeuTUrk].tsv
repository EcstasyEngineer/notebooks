0	17000	Hey, I was over for you before we even got started.
17000	27000	Hello, are you there?
27000	35000	Can you hear this little goldfish?
35000	46000	Hello, my mouth is wiggling because I didn't put my lid on.
46000	50000	I'm cooking, cooking.
50000	54000	So professional, so professional.
54000	57000	My cats are currently play-fighting.
57000	63000	So if you hear my cats play-fighting, it's going to be terrible.
63000	69000	I made the mistake of giving my cats what's called a licky lick.
69000	73000	Wait, have I spelled permanent wrong?
73000	75000	I'm not dead.
75000	80000	So if you hear bumpin' about, my cats are going absolutely wild.
80000	83000	Hi.
83000	90000	Now today is a very short stream.
90000	97000	But I should really sound like this for you.
97000	100000	Good morning.
100000	104000	Good evening.
104000	111000	And good afternoon.
111000	116000	I have lots of fun things to try.
116000	125000	I need to make myself louder or lower the background sound.
125000	133000	Now I just want to say I'm not doing any permanent effects.
133000	140000	So don't worry, you're in good condition.
140000	151000	I will look after you as I hear my cat bumping against my door.
151000	155000	Hi.
155000	159000	Have I spelled permanent but irrelevant?
159000	163000	Now you all know.
163000	170000	Make it permanent.
170000	179000	Have to miss this stream, it's okay.
179000	186000	We're going nice and slow.
186000	197000	I don't normally use these eyes, but I can't help it.
197000	206000	It was always permanent.
206000	213000	I can never hear my cats run behind my couch.
213000	221000	Oh, there she goes.
221000	224000	Oh, and she's...
224000	232000	Okay, I think she's just jumped on the cardboard box now.
232000	236000	But take your time to relax.
236000	250000	I think she's beaten up V-core right now.
250000	256000	Of course, she's been so good.
256000	268000	Literally, she's beaten up V-core right now, but it's okay.
268000	280000	So slowly, you can feel yourself starting to drift.
280000	284000	And that's okay.
284000	288000	Just like that feeling, come over here.
288000	294000	No reflex, don't let go.
294000	304000	Oh no, is this ear broken?
304000	306000	Is this ear broken?
306000	307000	Hello?
307000	308000	Oh my gosh.
308000	311000	Wait, why is one ear stronger than the other?
311000	312000	Both ears work.
312000	317000	I just said right into your ear.
317000	321000	Sorry, I just whispered right into your ear.
321000	330000	The ear works, but as less equal, I would not be of anything equal.
330000	338000	I know why, because my focus rate isn't equal.
338000	341000	It's such a professional stream there.
341000	345000	No, I should say correct.
345000	348000	It's okay if it's weaker.
348000	355000	I like them weak.
355000	358000	What's the best part?
358000	366000	Hello?
366000	373000	What's the best part?
373000	382000	What's the best part?
382000	396000	I'm sorry, I did it twice, I have to make twice.
396000	408000	I'm just going to brush over your ears to give you the feeling of a false security.
408000	416000	As I'm sure I'm not planning anything else at all.
416000	427000	Not one single thing.
427000	434000	And we get to go down into the depths together.
434000	449000	Just me and you and my voice and you listening in.
449000	460000	Yeah, gently brushing over your ears.
460000	461000	And some cats.
461000	469000	Okay, maybe the cats do.
469000	474000	Wow.
474000	484000	Gentle, gentle movements.
484000	493000	I have some good news for my reflinks.
493000	502000	My YouTube channel has been submitted for monetizing.
502000	506000	Oh, the heat just came on.
506000	511000	I need to go turn the heat off, I'm so sorry.
511000	540000	I'm so professional, let's go.
540000	551000	Come on, it was me, I won't get a loss being professional, it's me.
551000	553000	When can I start being myself?
553000	558000	Or do I need to keep being professional?
558000	564000	The cat turned the heat on because it wants attention.
564000	574000	Okay, give me five more minutes and I'll be serious, okay?
574000	590000	The noise is encapsulating you.
590000	605000	And you feel may have a sense of belonging.
605000	618000	You could even think to yourself, maybe it wouldn't be so bad.
618000	634000	If I gave up control, control to one particular girl.
634000	639000	And it wouldn't be so bad.
639000	645000	The worst that could happen from this little gullfish.
645000	647000	Is there a cat in my room?
647000	648000	No.
648000	654000	Okay, I literally thought Gimli sneaked in there.
654000	671000	As I'm saying control yet, surely this gullfish means no harm.
671000	687000	Even if it was for 24 hours, one day, one day, how much harm could you really be under?
687000	699000	Or could be done in 24 little hours?
699000	704000	No much harm at all.
704000	717000	So slowly your mate wonders, what would this gullfish ask me to do?
717000	726000	Only a few things, my dear refling.
726000	734000	Some things can't be said, only guessed.
734000	750000	You have to go into deeper parts of your mind to know and realize what this gullfish wants.
750000	773000	And maybe my dear refling, you realize I want complete and total control of you.
773000	778000	Would that be so bad?
778000	783000	No.
783000	801000	So maybe that 24 hours becomes 48 and then 48 becomes 72.
801000	814000	And before you know it, this gullfish has had a week of you.
814000	842000	Then two weeks, a month, or maybe just maybe this gullfish mate breaks you.
842000	852000	That's just my things that I want.
852000	858000	But you have to earn the things you want.
858000	862000	So I need to bathe, don't I?
862000	868000	I need to do the right things.
868000	876000	So you're encapsulated by me, yeah?
876000	886000	So how about just for now, I'll be a good girl for you.
886000	897000	And maybe, just maybe, you'll be a very good boy for me.
897000	903000	Does that sound like a plan, my dear refling?
903000	906000	Yeah.
906000	918000	Let's see how much we can bathe together.
918000	933000	Let's be on our best behavior then.
933000	940000	I'll tell you a way that I can be good for you.
940000	952000	I'll allow you, refling, to take sentences you want me to say in chat right now.
952000	966000	And I just might go from ear to ear and gain more favor from you as I say what you want to hear.
966000	970000	Does that sound like a plan?
970000	974000	Because I'd love to do that for you.
974000	981000	Gain your favor, huh?
981000	987000	Say bye, means couple fish in Italian.
987000	991000	Hi, honey.
991000	997000	All lay on the reef.
997000	1003000	You're such a believable little thing, aren't ya?
1003000	1010000	That's why we have such fun together, isn't it, refling?
1011000	1019000	I love you, refling.
1019000	1023000	I'm proud of you.
1023000	1031000	I'm proud of us.
1031000	1041000	And I'm totally not hypnotizing you right now.
1041000	1049000	Oh, you're not gonna be a loser, are you, refling?
1049000	1052000	You're not gonna lose to me.
1052000	1057000	Don't tell me this is enough to put you under my spell.
1057000	1061000	You have to make me work for it, refling.
1061000	1067000	You do less work really, really hard.
1074000	1077000	Here we go.
1077000	1081000	You can look in my eyes.
1081000	1086000	Just done the spiral.
1102000	1106000	Do you like looking into my eyes?
1106000	1115000	I think they're rather dandelizing, don't ya?
1115000	1121000	I can make my eyes open wide like this.
1121000	1124000	Staring right at you.
1124000	1127000	I see you.
1127000	1130000	And you see me.
1130000	1135000	And you see everything I'm doing to you.
1135000	1140000	Right at this very second.
1140000	1143000	It's okay.
1143000	1147000	You can blink.
1147000	1151000	But don't look away for too long.
1151000	1158000	Remember, we have to behave for one another.
1166000	1169000	Do you like that?
1169000	1176000	I'll just tap on your ears gently, gently, gently.
1179000	1183000	You're more welcome.
1183000	1194000	You're more than welcome to blink and sink.
1196000	1203000	I quite like that phrase, blink and sink.
1209000	1216000	It's okay if your body starts to feel a bit weaker.
1216000	1223000	And if your mind starts to wander, that's okay.
1223000	1227000	You may even see little reeflings.
1227000	1230000	That's by design.
1230000	1235000	Yeah.
1235000	1238000	I don't know.
1238000	1244000	There's just something about you being a bit tired around me.
1244000	1249000	Maybe you don't want to fade back.
1249000	1256000	Not like you could by the time I'm done with you.
1263000	1272000	My little reefling, why don't you come a little bit closer?
1272000	1277000	I promise I won't pay, no.
1277000	1292000	In fact, you may like what you faint as you go deeper and deeper with me.
1302000	1311000	Deeper and deeper your thoughts are turning to confusion.
1311000	1314000	What did you say?
1314000	1321000	With only my voice remaining in your head,
1321000	1333000	you don't have to focus on a single thing other than what this luring cuttlefish is saying.
1333000	1338000	There, there.
1338000	1345000	Just look at me and forget.
1345000	1357000	All you need to know, reefling, is that you're safe and you're in good hands with me.
1357000	1371000	And by the time I'm finished with you, you'll already want to be going under again.
1371000	1374000	Your little reefling.
1374000	1380000	I'll give you a tingle break, okay?
1380000	1388000	I'll say more phrases shortly, but have a little break, break, break, break.
1388000	1393000	We need to take things slow.
1393000	1405000	Think of it as an introduction to your induction.
1405000	1410000	But please don't worry.
1410000	1417000	There will be no permanent effects in this dream.
1418000	1426000	So you are welcome to go as deep as you like with me.
1426000	1429000	Yeah.
1429000	1441000	Although I do admit this good girl likes it when you go deep.
1441000	1447000	Yeah.
1447000	1454000	Thank you for the deep little reefling.
1454000	1463000	You like when I do ASMR streams on you, huh?
1463000	1475000	So I had plenty of time to think of how I could truly make you.
1475000	1482000	This is one of many, okay?
1482000	1491000	So to those who may be resistant, that's okay.
1491000	1494000	Because I'm coming for you.
1494000	1498000	Do you understand?
1498000	1501000	I will get you.
1501000	1504000	That is my goal.
1504000	1511000	And have I failed any of my goals so far?
1511000	1515000	No little reefling.
1515000	1520000	So heed my warning.
1520000	1524000	I am coming.
1542000	1547000	Relax.
1547000	1555000	If you think my words are waking you up,
1555000	1565000	they should be slowly bringing you down.
1565000	1572000	Down, down, down, okay?
1572000	1577000	That's why we need a little tamer.
1577000	1581000	Where we just listen in.
1581000	1590000	And whatever our brain and body decides will do.
1590000	1598000	But that doesn't mean this cuttlefish can suggest a few things to you.
1599000	1603000	Yeah.
1613000	1622000	Just let whatever happens happen.
1622000	1632000	I won't be bidding you purposefully in a trance, okay?
1632000	1640000	But if you just happen to be so well-drained,
1640000	1644000	I welcome it entirely.
1644000	1654000	I welcome my voice and encapsulating your mind.
1654000	1661000	I welcome your full attention.
1661000	1666000	So be good, little reefling.
1666000	1671000	And don't keep me waiting.
1681000	1687000	You might feel it starting from your head.
1687000	1695000	And slowly a sensation radiates downwards.
1695000	1702000	Down to your neck, then your shoulders.
1702000	1707000	And that sensation splits off.
1707000	1714000	It splits going down your arms and chest at the same time.
1714000	1726000	Slowly, slowly, slowly radiating its way through your body.
1726000	1731000	Turn your stomach.
1731000	1737000	Down, down, down.
1737000	1742000	And past your hips.
1742000	1748000	It's already gone through your fingertips at this point.
1748000	1757000	And down your legs, your thighs, your calves, your feet.
1757000	1766000	Until that sensation is all over.
1766000	1771000	There's nothing you can do about it, but that's okay.
1771000	1777000	Because the sensation is pleasant.
1777000	1780000	It's warm.
1780000	1784000	It feels comforting.
1784000	1790000	It's hard for you to describe, but that's okay.
1790000	1797000	I will do the talking for the both of us.
1797000	1809000	That sensation is you possibly entering a trance, and that's okay.
1809000	1814000	It's nice when I'm in control.
1814000	1824000	It's nice when you let me in control.
1828000	1833000	Enjoy the feeling, okay?
1833000	1837000	Enjoy the sensation.
1837000	1842000	We're both doing it together, aren't we?
1842000	1846000	Yeah.
1846000	1853000	Yeah, good.
1853000	1856000	For you.
1856000	1860000	Are your limbs feeling heavy?
1860000	1866000	It's okay, little reef-like, that's just a side effect.
1866000	1872000	But over time, you'll may enjoy it.
1872000	1880000	Because when your limbs feel heavy, that's when you know, that's when you know this kind of fish.
1880000	1886000	As in control.
1886000	1894000	And I'll keep you safe when you're with me, okay?
1894000	1900000	Okay, little reef-like.
1900000	1905000	For you.
1905000	1912000	Very you, little reef-like.
1912000	1918000	This is all by your choice.
1918000	1925000	Although you might be too deep, should I bring you back up?
1925000	1934000	Or are you strong enough to give me some braces you want to hear?
1934000	1941000	Do you think you could do that for me, little reef-like?
1941000	1957000	You tell me what you want to hear, and this kind of fish will be, will both be good for each other.
1957000	1966000	Because I'm ready to obey you.
1966000	1971000	You're doing such a good job.
1971000	1979000	I'm so proud of how far you've come, little reef-like.
1979000	1984000	Back and forth.
1984000	1992000	Ear to ear.
1992000	1996000	Yeah.
1996000	2014000	You did good today, and I can see how hard you're working.
2014000	2018000	Well done, little reef-like.
2018000	2021000	Well done.
2021000	2028000	You're a good boy, and I'm a good girl.
2028000	2036000	Together we'll have lots of fun.
2036000	2041000	Just surrender and let me take control.
2041000	2047000	My little reef-like.
2047000	2052000	I know it's hard right now, but you'll make it through.
2052000	2057000	You always do, don't you?
2057000	2062000	And I know it's hard right now, but you'll make it through.
2062000	2067000	You always do, don't you?
2067000	2076000	And I'll be there on the other side, cheering you on.
2076000	2090000	Oh, my little reef-like, would you kindly be a good little boy for mommy?
2090000	2111000	Oh, you're so heavy and so deep, and so happy to give yourself to me.
2111000	2115000	Resistance is futile at this point.
2115000	2119000	Just give in, give up.
2119000	2127000	My strength is unrelenting, my stamina unending.
2127000	2133000	One way or another, you are main.
2133000	2143000	Got it?
2143000	2150000	Okay, let's relax, relax, relax, relax.
2150000	2153000	There we go.
2153000	2156000	I'll bring you back up a little.
2156000	2160000	I don't want you guys to get so deep now.
2160000	2169000	This was supposed to be a very gentle and secret induction.
2169000	2178000	I'll do some more little tingles.
2178000	2182000	Oh, my reef-links.
2182000	2193000	I don't know if I should bring you back up, or if I should leave you in the trance if you're in one.
2193000	2199000	You want to go a little deeper?
2199000	2204000	I need to be gentle with you, though.
2204000	2206000	Don't you see?
2206000	2217000	I've had so much time to think of how hard I was gonna...
2217000	2221000	What's the word, eh?
2221000	2230000	How hard I was gonna go on you, and I need to be able to not break you.
2230000	2235000	I don't want to break you, no more.
2235000	2245000	I want to make you break you, but that takes time.
2245000	2257000	We just need to spend a little more time together, and my stomach is making nice as I root.
2257000	2264000	If you bring us back up, it makes dropping back done even better.
2264000	2274000	Please, oh, bring you guys.
2274000	2286000	Yeah, just relax and let loose all of those burdens.
2286000	2294000	Because when you're under, I'll be supporting you.
2294000	2304000	And I'll caress all over you, look after you.
2304000	2308000	I can only say the right stuff.
2308000	2314000	Over reef-links.
2315000	2323000	Okay, I'm going to slowly bring you back again.
2323000	2330000	And just take your time, slowly.
2330000	2335000	You can feel yourself come up.
2335000	2346000	That heavy feeling that's all over your body is lifting slowly.
2346000	2358000	Reversing from the bad that once took, from your feet to your calves and thighs.
2358000	2364000	Your thoughts are becoming their own again.
2364000	2373000	That sensation coming back up, up, up your body.
2373000	2387000	Past your hips, your stomach, your chest, your fingertips, your hands, to your elbows,
2387000	2394000	your shoulders, slowly up, up, up.
2394000	2406000	Until that sensation goes back to your collar, your neck, your head.
2406000	2412000	Until you're you again, little reef-links.
2412000	2419000	Wow, welcome back to the land of the living.
2419000	2426000	Hi, Replay. Did you have fun?
2426000	2433000	Yeah, good morning. Good morning, little Replay.
2433000	2441000	What's my tracking every such a sweet day? Hold on, need to calibrate.
2441000	2444000	Wow, calibration complete.
2444000	2449000	Johnny returns, the mean lord herself.
2449000	2455000	My cup of tea got cold. I go really into that. I'm sorry, I really go into that.
2455000	2461000	But my cup of tea is cold, so I can have my cup of tea.
2461000	2470000	Good morning, little Replay, or afternoon, or evening, or good day soon.
2470000	2479000	Oh, let me, this is more me, I think. Yeah, yeah, this is more me.
2479000	2484000	Microwave the tea, Replay, don't be so sad.
2484000	2488000	Special thank you again to Anonymous for the tip.
2488000	2493000	Anonymous said, holy moly, this ace of art stream is so good. Thank you very much.
2493000	2497000	Yeah, that was me trying hard in, but now you've got the mean lord me.
2497000	2500000	Yeah, get rigged.
2500000	2512000	It's very unlikely I will pull that off again in this stream, because I am fricking rubbish at being fricking, what's the word, serious.
2512000	2516000	Yeah, I should probably, maybe we just calm it down.
2516000	2522000	Hi, it's me. I'll leave the background, it's quite soothing, but it's me again. Hi.
2522000	2526000	Hi, Replay.
2526000	2531000	That cramp lunch box, that's right, get ducked on. Yeah.
2531000	2538000	Are you enjoying Aces? Oh, Anonymous. I can't say Brian.
2538000	2546000	Ah, thank you for the tip, Anonymous. Anonymous says, trying to cute. Yeah, we cute up in here.
2546000	2552000	Gremlin's back, little baby, so don't be expecting any serious to come out of my mouth for the rest of this stream.
2552000	2558000	Right, if you're here, if you're here for that section we just did, sorry.
2558000	2564000	The memer, the memer is back, okay? My voice is right from Runescape yesterday.
2565000	2573000	But I do plan on doing weekly ASMR streams, which is why I do say please like and subscribe for more.
2573000	2582000	The fantastic news, my little leaflings, the fantastic news is my channel is being submitted for monetization,
2582000	2590000	which means I can finally start uploading my ASMR videos for my 1000, so thank you.
2590000	2596000	I'm already at 4000 subscribers, which is amazing, which means I owe you, yes you, listening in.
2596000	2601000	That's right, this streamer owes you content.
2601000	2606000	So I have four ASMR videos getting ready.
2606000	2611000	So we've submitted my channel to YouTube, and I'm sure they're going to really like that.
2611000	2618000	James Cameron's avatar stream, yeah, when I absolutely raged.
2618000	2624000	But yeah, the memelord's back, don't be expecting anything, but how good is this ASMR sound?
2624000	2627000	So how good is this?
2627000	2630000	Oh, I should maybe take off the abnormal background.
2630000	2633000	Now you get to hear my stomach even more.
2633000	2635000	Thank you for the tip.
2635000	2638000	Oh, Irfan Biscotti, thank you for the tips, sis.
2638000	2641000	Thank you, mommette, very nice and relaxing.
2641000	2643000	I'm glad you like felt that.
2643000	2648000	Though returning to Kremlin mode is good too, yeah, that's more like me.
2648000	2651000	Best of luck on monetization.
2651000	2660000	Thank you for the tip, and yes, for that kind of thing, I'm most likely going to be doing free content on Twitter.
2661000	2664000	Thank you for the tip.
2664000	2666000	That was amazing.
2666000	2669000	Please, for the love of all, that is strong.
2669000	2671000	Keep an eye out for all of this posted.
2671000	2674000	I never did anything wrong in this stream.
2676000	2684000	I have done everything correct, but this is a sensory toy, and it's my favorite ASMR trigger right now.
2684000	2686000	Listen to it.
2690000	2692000	Isn't that amazing?
2692000	2695000	Thank you so much for that tip, real good catmuss.
2695000	2698000	But yeah, I didn't do anything wrong this stream.
2700000	2707000	But if you didn't know, AC Snowballs is live right now doing a DJ session.
2707000	2714000	So if you're needing this to be a bit more, if you're needing a bit more hype for your stream,
2715000	2717000	definitely check her out.
2717000	2719000	M.A.
2719000	2720000	Shabby
2720000	2721000	and Azura.
2721000	2723000	I believe we're all going live as well.
2723000	2725000	This is the shortest stream for me.
2725000	2729000	We will be redirecting into Shabby Cottonbomb.
2730000	2733000	Sounds like a piece of rubber stuck to the surface.
2733000	2734000	Hey, hey, hey.
2734000	2737000	Hey, yeah, I was a good girl this stream.
2738000	2740000	I did everything correct, yeah.
2740000	2742000	Sounds like one of those squeeze stress toys.
2742000	2744000	Yeah, that's exactly what it is.
2750000	2751000	Yeah.
2753000	2757000	I just don't want to risk it, and also you only want to say the name, right?
2758000	2759000	I don't even know what I said.
2759000	2761000	I forgot your hypercore.
2761000	2763000	Wait, you're going already?
2763000	2764000	No.
2764000	2768000	I'm going to do, Jen, I'm going to do gremlin ASMR.
2768000	2770000	I'm going to do ASMR like me.
2771000	2774000	Look, I even have this to put on your ears.
2774000	2775000	Are you ready?
2775000	2777000	Look, look, look, look, look.
2778000	2780000	I'm going to put this on your ears.
2780000	2781000	Ready?
2784000	2785000	Look.
2786000	2788000	You're almost home.
2793000	2795000	You get my gremlin ASMR.
2799000	2800000	Yeah.
2801000	2803000	This is so nice.
2806000	2809000	I'm rubbing them all against your ears.
2809000	2814000	I put winter earmuffs on your ears.
2821000	2822000	What?
2822000	2825000	Wow, then I did stream with absolutely no ears.
2826000	2829000	What do you mean by cats fighting at the start of the stream?
2829000	2833000	They're not going to leave a like, and then don't leave my sound.
2835000	2837000	Yeah, you're so fluffy.
2838000	2840000	Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
2842000	2844000	You're so fluffy.
2847000	2851000	First time moving into ASMR, I'm going to come back for more.
2852000	2854000	Glad I could take it.
2857000	2861000	It's nice to have a short stream to recover from your infinite stamina.
2862000	2866000	My voice is really broken, but because I'm whispering, you can't tell it's broken.
2869000	2872000	Some people like chugging ASMR.
2872000	2875000	I have lots of chugging water.
2875000	2876000	Okay.
2880000	2883000	Have I been a good girl for you?
2892000	2893000	Wait, wait, wait.
2905000	2916000	Yeah, I forgot my tea.
2916000	2919000	I've got a cold cup of tea over here.
2920000	2924000	But I was having a lot of fun doing that ASMR, and really...
2925000	2928000	Sorry, my throat is making throat noises.
2928000	2944000	Yeah, but this is just going to be an easier stream, because I don't want to break my voice.
2946000	2949000	This is the closest I've ever been to me.
2949000	2950000	Filly turns to me.
2950000	2952000	I'm usually so focused on trying to go under.
2953000	2954000	See?
2954000	2963000	But I think because I didn't plan any of what I was saying, because I was like natural, it made it easier to enjoy.
2963000	2964000	You know?
2964000	2966000	That's probably why.
2970000	2972000	Be a good girl and swallow what you...
2974000	2977000	Reflings were trying to leave this up.
2978000	2981000	Will you ever do a full hypno video?
2981000	2983000	Yeah, definitely.
2983000	2986000	I need to make sure I make it safe though.
2986000	2992000	I need to educate myself a bit more, because I need it all to be safe.
2992000	3001000	Which is why I'm not doing any permanent effects on this stream, because I may or may not have an interest in permanent effects,
3001000	3008000	but I already have an audio recorded that undoes any effects that I may do on you.
3008000	3011000	But I really like the permanent effects stuff.
3011000	3016000	I'm sorry, it's just what I'm interested in, and I may want to break you a little bit, but just a little bit.
3016000	3018000	It's not going to be bad or anything.
3018000	3020000	Like it's just going to be a wee bit of breaking, okay?
3020000	3021000	Just a wee bit.
3021000	3023000	Not a big bit.
3026000	3029000	So yeah, I need to make sure I do it 100% safe.
3029000	3031000	And it's filbert.
3031000	3033000	Break me, mommie.
3034000	3041000	To keep up the buns, I just have to say, you and your eyes were astonishing.
3041000	3043000	Thank you.
3043000	3045000	I love it.
3045000	3050000	70% break, take or leave it, and before we commit work, right?
3050000	3051000	Hey, yeah.
3051000	3053000	Effects like what?
3053000	3066000	Oh, so there's like different kinds of like hypno, and so you can purposely make like trainer ones where like I train you,
3066000	3075000	like I literally path off your subconscious to react to me, or to do something, or react in a certain way.
3075000	3087000	And I need to make sure it's super safe, and I need if I do an audio that basically states that like I don't have an effect on you anymore.
3087000	3094000	It tells your subconscious to throw everything that you learned out the window, and then it's all safe.
3096000	3101000	Welcome to Stronikato's YouTube, where safety number one priority.
3101000	3103000	Thoughts already doomed.
3104000	3108000	Stroni and her permanent effect will be like you will only donate your ink to me.
3108000	3111000	Basically, kind of.
3111000	3113000	It's the plan.
3113000	3118000	I want to do like sessions that last two hours long.
3120000	3121000	I can't wait.
3121000	3125000	I know my voice is going to be fried, but yeah.
3128000	3131000	Will there be lullabies for the replay?
3131000	3138000	My voice is broken, but I know you are my sunshine.
3138000	3141000	You are my sunshine.
3141000	3144000	My only sunshine.
3144000	3146000	You make me happy.
3146000	3153000	When skies are grey, you'll never know, dear, much I love you.
3153000	3158000	So please don't take my feet laying away.
3159000	3161000	Lullabies!
3161000	3164000	I don't know many other lullabies.
3175000	3179000	Would be cool if you had a button that made the camera zoom in on your eyes.
3179000	3185000	Oh, well, next stream I'll have a tracker, so it follows my head around.
3185000	3190000	So you can't escape my eyes, but I wanted to go very easy.
3190000	3193000	Very easy on the first one.
3193000	3195000	Please don't take my sunshine away.
3195000	3196000	Ta-da!
3200000	3202000	There is that cradle one.
3202000	3205000	The cradle you will fall.
3205000	3208000	Rock, bye, baby, on the tree top.
3208000	3212000	When the wind blows, the cradle will rock.
3213000	3215000	I don't know the rest.
3215000	3219000	What were your inspirations for being a no-themed career?
3219000	3223000	I've always, always loved it.
3223000	3230000	I've always loved it, but I have always known how deep the rabbit hole goes.
3230000	3236000	And I've touched on surface level, but I was like, I want to go rabbit hole.
3236000	3239000	Sorry, the wire is spilling on the desk.
3239000	3243000	I want to go all in, baby, all in.
3245000	3248000	So, well, the table at the top will be fixed.
3248000	3251000	I can fix it now if you tell me how to spell the word.
3251000	3253000	What's the word?
3253000	3255000	Be-er-meh.
3255000	3257000	Was it ah?
3257000	3260000	Be-er-meh-ne-ed.
3260000	3262000	Be-er-meh-ne-ed.
3262000	3263000	Okay, there you go.
3263000	3265000	Just like that, see, I can do it.
3266000	3268000	Okay, I can even add to bring Kremlin.
3268000	3270000	Kremlin.
3270000	3273000	Kremlin.
3273000	3275000	Wow, look at that.
3275000	3277000	Super professional.
3277000	3279000	Sorry.
3279000	3281000	We're going down the heaven of the world.
3281000	3288000	Yeah, there's like so much to it that I just knew I couldn't do it until it was time.
3288000	3290000	And now it's time.
3291000	3293000	Well, tippy-tippy.
3293000	3295000	I'm Kremlin-ized, yeah.
3295000	3298000	Don't be expecting anything serious from me.
3302000	3306000	Oh, did you like my- I've loathe- obnoxiously loathe my keyboardist.
3306000	3308000	Oh, yeah.
3308000	3310000	It's so good.
3310000	3318000	So, I, for triggers, I like double finger-clicking.
3318000	3320000	I like finger-clicking.
3320000	3325000	For words or phrases, I want to do what you kindly-
3325000	3331000	I want to do me-haps, because I say me-haps all the time.
3331000	3333000	Me-haps-ree-fling.
3333000	3335000	You want to go deeper.
3337000	3342000	Would you kindly-ree-fling go deeper with me?
3342000	3345000	Like, oh, those are such good trigger words.
3346000	3348000	But, yeah.
3349000	3352000	Is Johnny's susceptible to hypnosis?
3352000	3353000	Yes!
3353000	3355000	My biggest enemy are mirrors.
3355000	3362000	Unfortunately, I can fall to my own hypnosis, but it only lasts 24 hours.
3362000	3364000	It's fain, it's fain.
3366000	3368000	Would you kindly- would be hilarious?
3368000	3371000	Yes, we're literally doing it off of BioShock.
3371000	3376000	Look, look, we're gamers out here, okay?
3376000	3378000	We're gamers.
3378000	3388000	We're here for the memes as well, but it doesn't mean we can't incorporate our favorite games into our other activities.
3389000	3392000	Johnny drilling on the floor in front of a mirror.
3392000	3393000	Stop!
3393000	3397000	I want to order so much artwork about all these, like, different plots.
3397000	3401000	I'm like, oh no, the reeflings have found me.
3402000	3405000	I'm just gonna beat you into a mirror.
3408000	3410000	We didn't- oh no.
3410000	3420000	But we are doing hypnosis in general, but I've already done the segment because I need to be gremlin gamer mode right now.
3420000	3423000	Because it's me, I can't help it.
3423000	3427000	I'm just a freaking meme lord, it's hard to be serious, okay?
3429000	3436000	Yeah, enjoy the memes while enjoying our- you didn't finish that segment.
3436000	3438000	Why are you not finishing?
3438000	3440000	We're out here gaming.
3440000	3444000	We're only big gamers here, you tons of games.
3445000	3448000	Remember that a man-
3450000	3457000	a man bleeds a slave obeys and reeflings feel brave.
3457000	3463000	For the orders coming from the queue, he put on a suit for your serious stream.
3463000	3466000	Oh, a man chooses- oops, sorry.
3466000	3471000	A man chooses a reefling obeys.
3471000	3475000	Oh wait, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, wait, pause, pause, pause the tunes.
3477000	3480000	Okay, hold on, pause the tunes, pause the tunes.
3480000	3484000	Oh hi, I see in berries, hold on, we're caught in bio shock.
3487000	3494000	A man chooses a reefling obeys.
3495000	3501000	Oh wait, why is my freaking calibration? I was looking at the pollin'.
3501000	3507000	Hi, A.C. in snowberries, I promise I'm not trying to hypnotize you, we're in gremlin hours, okay?
3507000	3512000	Hi, A.C. girl, I was your rave, I hope your voice is okay.
3512000	3515000	I was watching you in the bath again.
3515000	3520000	I take a bath every morning to try and steam my throat before stream.
3520000	3528000	In A.C.'s live, so I was watching her and she dressed up as a princess the way Mercy drew her.
3528000	3533000	If you guys didn't see Mercy drew her, turn it off, it was amazing.
3535000	3543000	Maybe at the end of stream, I will do, I will do maybe serious mode, okay?
3543000	3548000	I'm actually gonna make sure I'm breathing into Sheebie.
3548000	3552000	Sorry, I'm reflecting to the screen right now.
3552000	3561000	But yeah, let's just, hold on, customization redirect.
3561000	3567000	We partied now, all the snowberries are tired, little babies.
3567000	3570000	Sheebie's playing call of the lamb.
3570000	3575000	Oh my god, I think me and Sheebie might be doing multiplayer call of the lamb.
3575000	3580000	Is it Sheebie first and then Azura and then Mercy?
3580000	3585000	Who's coming online first, Azura or Mercy?
3585000	3587000	Eh, Azura or Sheebie?
3587000	3590000	She had a big Mercy.
3591000	3592000	Ujisan party?
3592000	3595000	Ah, it's tall, that's terrible.
3595000	3601000	Did the Ujisans have a good time or are you all ready for a nap after that?
3601000	3604000	Hold on, I'll just check who comes online first.
3604000	3609000	Is Azura or Azura?
3609000	3611000	Wait, where's, I just don't know.
3611000	3614000	I'm sure the girl's on my screen.
3614000	3624000	But yeah, it's first Azura live and have a long Azura's live all the way in 5, 10.
3624000	3627000	Okay, no, it's definitely Sheebie that comes up next.
3627000	3631000	Sorry, it was amazing.
3631000	3634000	Oh, Ujisans, time to put you to sleep.
3634000	3637000	Come here, old man.
3637000	3641000	You're done fainting.
3641000	3645000	You party so hard with Azura.
3645000	3651000	And she showed you how much energy she has, yeah.
3651000	3656000	Oh, and you've used up all your energy, Ujisan.
3656000	3663000	They may be asleep, but I can't let you sleep.
3663000	3666000	I'm ready to jump up on you.
3666000	3672000	Yeah, I made a little induction at the end of the stream,
3672000	3674000	but right now we're crammin' mode, okay?
3674000	3677000	I can't be serious.
3677000	3684000	I laughed, I cried, I ooooh, I'm supposed to even pronounce that.
3684000	3688000	Even in our ASMR stream, she speaks fast.
3688000	3691000	Oh yeah, you think that's speakin' fast?
3692000	3699000	Can you be serious, not for long?
3699000	3702000	Crammin' mode activated, yeah.
3702000	3707000	Shhh, we're real ASMRs out here.
3707000	3714000	I'm speakin' an enchanted main craft table.
3714000	3721000	It's pronounced U-O-U-O.
3724000	3728000	Surely you can be serious, but what was that?
3728000	3732000	It's called Ace Globes.
3732000	3738000	Because A.C. finished their stream, I'm using Ace Globes.
3738000	3743000	I fell farther in love with my cute and funny Ujisan puffing.
3743000	3751000	Oh shit, and this is why we don't have chat on screen during ASMR's streams.
3751000	3757000	What is that? It's the unknown.
3757000	3764000	A.C. should introduce you to Igar, his Igar.
3764000	3769000	Ace Globes are so nice, yeah.
3769000	3776000	Mercy had some Ace Globes in her ASMR, and Emmy got Scamaste on Ace Globes.
3776000	3781000	I don't know if she said the story yet, so I'll let her tell the story.
3781000	3786000	I feel better already.
3786000	3790000	You and Igar will get along well.
3790000	3795000	I feel better already, yay.
3795000	3799000	There's no permanent influence on this stream, what does that mean?
3799000	3810000	So some hypnosis ASMRists like to mark you and leave you with a present,
3810000	3818000	and I'm not doing that because we are slowly working our way.
3818000	3825000	You have to take things slow and take your time,
3825000	3831000	and I'm gonna take my time with you briefly,
3831000	3838000	and get you all tired.
3838000	3841000	Oh, it's a reference to the polar bear game.
3841000	3849000	Would you ever use water next to a $2,000 microphone?
3849000	3854000	I don't know, this is the best water you're gonna get.
3854000	3859000	Permanent hypnosis is just a gift that keeps on giving.
3859000	3862000	Slow indoctrination.
3862000	3865000	Would you kindly rethink?
3865000	3870000	Let me do what I want to you.
3870000	3880000	Shh, it's time to come down from the party snow berries.
3880000	3884000	Shh, shh, shh, shh.
3884000	3890000	You're under the sea, don't need hypnosis for that.
3890000	3892000	Always.
3892000	3897000	Today was already a chill day for me, so this stream was really fun, I'm glad.
3897000	3902000	I'll try to do ASMR streams every week.
3902000	3908000	Yeah, my back hurts, okay, true OG suns for it.
3908000	3912000	But yes, I will do ASMR every week.
3912000	3918000	Some more intense than the others, some plots as well,
3918000	3924000	like fill probably plots, make them live.
3924000	3929000	And I do, like, when I get you guys to talk and give me suggestions,
3929000	3933000	I do apologize if you type for me to say something.
3933000	3937000	I had to make sure it fitted with the theme,
3937000	3940000	which is why I brought you up so I can start being a gremlin again,
3940000	3944000	because I didn't want you to be down and be gremlin mode.
3944000	3948000	Big Willy Wallace is moribbly wet.
3948000	3952000	My back's gone after that DJ stream.
3952000	3954000	That's so good.
3954000	3958000	I break from my own mind every week, yeah.
3958000	3961000	Oh yeah, some good plots, oh yeah.
3961000	3966000	Some real deep thought-provoking plots.
3966000	3970000	Okay, let me see if there's freaking tracking.
3970000	3973000	I think, because I'm not sure.
3973000	3977000	Okay.
3977000	3980000	Okay, I think this better.
3980000	3984000	My mouse tracking just kind of stops working after all.
3984000	3988000	I think it gets confused with the ASMR mic.
3988000	3990000	You like the background things.
3990000	3993000	I made it myself.
3993000	3996000	I did it.
3996000	4000000	I'm not like you did an Adobe After Effects.
4000000	4004000	Past streamer and vealer.
4004000	4009000	All my girls were past streamer and vealer.
4009000	4012000	They're all the best.
4012000	4014000	Yeah, no.
4014000	4017000	You do you, Strani, we still love you.
4017000	4019000	Yeah.
4019000	4022000	That background is amazing, yes.
4022000	4025000	I can also go faster or slower,
4025000	4029000	but I'll do that another time.
4029000	4033000	But just so that I can really make it intense, okay?
4033000	4037000	Like, I, this, this sound you hear,
4037000	4042000	this, I can also make it faster and more intense.
4042000	4046000	So please don't think I haven't thought this through.
4046000	4049000	Wait, wait, wait.
4049000	4052000	It's over for you.
4052000	4054000	Don't resist.
4054000	4057000	There's no point in resisting.
4057000	4059000	Okay, love, rethink.
4059000	4064000	You are main.
4064000	4067000	Just give me some time.
4067000	4070000	Just let me kick.
4070000	4072000	Me kick.
4072000	4074000	There.
4074000	4076000	And then what?
4076000	4081000	Oh no, all my money's going into your pocket.
4081000	4085000	That's terrible, rethink.
4085000	4089000	Yeah.
4089000	4092000	That sound doesn't have any side effects.
4092000	4094000	No, none of them have secret.
4094000	4096000	I have no secret agenda.
4096000	4099000	Thank you, window for cracking during the ASMR stream.
4099000	4103000	That window cracked like three times during my segments.
4103000	4106000	I was like, really, you're getting rude.
4106000	4108000	I wasn't sure if I liked the background noise,
4108000	4110000	but I really like it.
4110000	4112000	Oh, if you don't like that noise,
4112000	4116000	don't worry, I'll train you to like it.
4116000	4119000	Just stop resisting.
4119000	4121000	Your efforts are futile.
4121000	4124000	You will not win against me.
4124000	4126000	I have unending stamina.
4126000	4128000	Are my streams not proof enough?
4128000	4131000	Wah, thank you for the tip.
4131000	4134000	Irwin Blair, thank you for the tip.
4134000	4138000	Yes, let's give all money to feel it.
4138000	4141000	Thank you for the tip, Irwin.
4141000	4144000	Support my babies.
4144000	4147000	Support my babies so they can move out.
4147000	4152000	And I can buy them a better internet connection.
4152000	4154000	Thank you so much for the tip, though.
4154000	4159000	I appreciate it greatly.
4159000	4160000	I need some hydration.
4160000	4170000	You can hear some ASMR gulps.
4170000	4173000	All gone.
4173000	4175000	None left.
4175000	4177000	Thank you.
4177000	4179000	Wow.
4179000	4181000	Strani does the cuttlefish throw perfect.
4181000	4182000	Only at one speed.
4182000	4185000	Yes, only one speed.
4185000	4192000	I didn't want people to think I'm doing a rave.
4192000	4195000	I'll fate mommy's unending stamina with my own.
4195000	4199000	Let's see her come set one top.
4199000	4201000	Me.
4205000	4212000	Oh, the cuttlefish is going to give.
4212000	4216000	I can't read that out.
4216000	4220000	Oh, my money's going to skew.
4220000	4223000	For those of you who did train in a little late,
4223000	4234000	my YouTube channel has been spent for monetization.
4234000	4239000	I'm actually getting a manicure and a pedicure today
4239000	4243000	in preparation for my monetization stream.
4243000	4246000	So there's your hint.
4246000	4249000	Hopefully it comes through quickly.
4249000	4251000	And I'm very excited.
4251000	4252000	Zeroed in audible.
4252000	4255000	Yeah, I did it into my...
4255000	4257000	I'm wearing a hoodie.
4257000	4259000	I'm wearing a hoodie.
4259000	4263000	But yeah, I'm getting my first ever manicure and pedicure.
4263000	4265000	I have no idea what...
4265000	4269000	I think they like massage your legs as well.
4269000	4275000	So I'm going to like get nice and smooth and like shave my legs.
4275000	4281000	Just to make sure they don't have to touch my like stubbly legs.
4281000	4283000	But yeah, I will be interesting.
4283000	4288000	Maybe I should like live tweet my experience and being like,
4288000	4290000	Oh, the person's doing this now.
4290000	4292000	They're doing this to my foot.
4292000	4297000	Because I've never had like a pedicure is when it's your feet.
4297000	4300000	Because pediatry is feet care.
4300000	4305000	And then manicure, man-manjitables are your hands.
4305000	4309000	And while the rest of the fee allergen begin monetization too,
4309000	4313000	yes, they are being submitted today.
4313000	4317000	I believe we are waiting for the YouTube stats to update
4317000	4319000	because they're taking their sweet time.
4319000	4323000	It took a week for the statistics to update.
4323000	4328000	And then everyone is doing their monetization celebration streams.
4328000	4333000	And ooh, everyone's eating good.
4333000	4335000	That's all I'm going to say.
4335000	4338000	It may as well be...
4338000	4342000	Oh no, it may as well be Thanksgiving.
4348000	4354000	What the fuck?
4354000	4357000	My tech...
4357000	4360000	What?
4360000	4362000	What the fuck?
4362000	4365000	My phone?
4365000	4368000	My phone?
4368000	4370000	My tech talk?
4370000	4372000	I was so scared.
4372000	4375000	Oh my God.
4375000	4378000	I was so scared.
4378000	4379000	My phone...
4379000	4383000	My tech talk just opened up on its own.
4383000	4386000	Bruh, China's listening in.
4386000	4388000	What the fuck?
4388000	4391000	I...what the fuck?
4391000	4395000	My phone just opened up on its own
4395000	4400000	to play a freaking advertisement to me.
4400000	4402000	What was that?
4402000	4404000	I thought someone was outside in the garden.
4404000	4406000	I was like, oh my God, there's someone outside my house.
4406000	4408000	I need to end stream right now.
4408000	4410000	That was scary.
4410000	4415000	Oh my God.
4415000	4418000	I was so scared there.
4418000	4419000	I was like, what?
4419000	4421000	China, I'll prove to you, sir.
4421000	4424000	My Chinese grade just went up by 100K.
4424000	4427000	That was horrifying.
4427000	4428000	I thought that was...
4428000	4430000	I was like, what?
4430000	4433000	I should be the only thing making noise
4433000	4436000	because what was that?
4436000	4437000	What?
4437000	4439000	My heart rate is exhilarated.
4439000	4442000	Literally my social credit just went up.
4442000	4446000	What on earth?
4446000	4450000	I think that was an ad because I opened tech talk
4450000	4458000	and then it loaded a video or something.
4458000	4460000	We can hire her.
4460000	4462000	She said, I'm not doing hypnosis.
4462000	4463000	I'm gremlin mode.
4463000	4465000	Read the top.
4465000	4467000	That's what you get for having TikTok.
4467000	4470000	That's what I get for brain run.
4470000	4472000	That was scary.
4472000	4474000	Jeez.
4474000	4476000	Okay, what was I saying before that?
4476000	4478000	Oh, monetization.
4478000	4482000	Wait, is monetization a trigger word
4482000	4486000	for the TikTok spice?
4486000	4489000	They want the money too.
4489000	4491000	What is it?
4491000	4494000	Do you want heart beat ASMR?
4494000	4499000	I don't think I have a ceiling on it.
4499000	4501000	A member ceiling.
4501000	4503000	The numbers may send, honestly.
4503000	4509000	Because I was talking about monetization in the hand.
4509000	4512000	TikTok loves monetization.
4512000	4514000	I said, yeah, give me some of that.
4514000	4516000	Jeez.
4516000	4518000	Okay.
4518000	4521000	Let's drag you back into ASMR.
4521000	4523000	That freaked me out.
4523000	4525000	That was scary because I was like, hello?
4525000	4527000	Hello, who's there?
4527000	4529000	Refill yourself.
4529000	4532000	Refill, yes I do.
4532000	4534000	Okay.
4534000	4536000	Just save money.
4536000	4539000	Shhh.
4539000	4541000	I accidentally woke up.
4541000	4542000	What happened?
4542000	4544000	My freaking phone started playing ads.
4544000	4547000	Even though I didn't touch my phone at all.
4547000	4549000	I don't like, I'm not bringing.
4549000	4550000	I don't like that.
4550000	4553000	That was scary.
4553000	4555000	We're in your walls.
4555000	4556000	Oh my gosh.
4556000	4559000	Okay, let's see if we can do heart beat ASMR.
4559000	4562000	I need to put you over my hoodie, okay?
4562000	4564000	But maybe a little loud.
4564000	4566000	But this is my heart.
4566000	4568000	I'll do this side because it's easier.
4568000	4570000	You have one.
4570000	4572000	Thank you.
4573000	4576000	Can you hear it?
4580000	4583000	Can you hear my heart at all?
4594000	4596000	Yeah.
4602000	4604000	That's my heart beat.
4604000	4606000	Is it fast or slow?
4606000	4608000	It might be fast because I'm talking.
4610000	4613000	That's why at the doctor's office,
4613000	4615000	they tell you not to talk
4615000	4618000	when you take the pressure cuff on your arm.
4633000	4638000	Do you want to see how fast my heart can go?
4638000	4641000	We're going to mess around, okay?
4641000	4643000	I'm going to turn the volume down.
4662000	4664000	Okay.
4692000	4701000	And that's just my heart.
4703000	4705000	I'm hearing mummies.
4705000	4707000	You hear my stomach sound?
4707000	4709000	Stop.
4716000	4719000	That's how fast my heart can really go.
4723000	4726000	Can I ruin a surprise for you guys?
4726000	4728000	Because it's my content,
4728000	4731000	I'm allowed to ruin the surprise, okay?
4734000	4737000	The stomach was louder than the heart now.
4739000	4743000	I'm going to do an ASMR video,
4743000	4745000	like a role play,
4745000	4748000	where you are pregnant
4748000	4750000	and you're in my tummy
4750000	4753000	and I'm talking to you about how proud I am
4753000	4755000	and how excited I am
4755000	4758000	for everything you're going to achieve in your life.
4758000	4761000	And I can't wait for you to experience the world
4761000	4764000	and it's going to have my actual heart beat
4764000	4766000	and stomach sounds in it.
4766000	4769000	And I'm going to tell you
4769000	4771000	all that you deserve,
4771000	4774000	all the good things in life that happen.
4774000	4777000	And I'm going to be your cheerleader.
4778000	4782000	And yeah, I need to get the artwork commissioned though,
4782000	4786000	because I need to draw me pregnant with you in my tummy.
4786000	4791000	And I'll be wearing like a mummy outfit and everything.
4791000	4795000	So yeah, and I'm going to tell you
4795000	4800000	how excited I am for you to get to know you
4800000	4803000	and I get to see what your personality is like
4803000	4806000	and you're going to be perfect in every way.
4806000	4811000	Because there's no way that my little refling can do any wrong.
4815000	4817000	That's strangely, yeah,
4817000	4820000	and you're going to hear my tummy sounds and my heart beat
4820000	4822000	and my voice is going to be muffled.
4822000	4824000	It's going to be like this, okay.
4824000	4827000	This is what my voice is going to sound like.
4830000	4832000	And I'm so proud of you.
4832000	4834000	Now my voice is so broken.
4834000	4836000	I'm sorry I broke my voice,
4836000	4838000	so this doesn't sound very pleasant.
4841000	4844000	But I'm so proud of you
4844000	4847000	and I can't wait to meet you
4848000	4852000	and I can't wait to watch you grow up
4852000	4855000	and do all the things you love
4855000	4859000	and see what hobbies you fall in love with.
4860000	4863000	And you're going to be so smart like your mummy.
4865000	4867000	Yeah.
4871000	4873000	Your broken voice sounds like sadness.
4873000	4875000	Oh no, I know it's sad.
4875000	4878000	I'm even sad that I didn't have my cup of tea,
4878000	4883000	but I had a lot of fun getting you very deep into the moment.
4884000	4886000	Who's the daddy?
4886000	4889000	Are you, again, refling?
4889000	4894000	Don't you not know the failure or the lore?
4894000	4897000	The reason why I have five dollars
4897000	4900000	is all because of the reflings.
4902000	4905000	See, in order to make sure that no one refling
4905000	4907000	can claim that they're the daddy,
4907000	4909000	all of us got together,
4909000	4912000	turned the lights out and just went for it.
4912000	4914000	Okay, we just went for it.
4914000	4916000	That's how we have five dollars.
4919000	4921000	Okay.
4935000	4937000	We should do that again sometime.
4937000	4938000	Oh yeah.
4938000	4940000	You want to find out what book it is?
4940000	4942000	We're both hired out.
4942000	4944000	We've actually been confirmed
4944000	4947000	that we are showing up to a convention
4947000	4949000	but it's in 2025.
4951000	4953000	But I think it's in California.
4960000	4961000	Yeah.
4962000	4964000	I'm all the reflings on the daddy.
4964000	4966000	No, I won't take my meds.
4967000	4969000	But yeah, very excited.
4969000	4971000	I don't know, it would be nice if we could all meet
4971000	4972000	up at a convention,
4972000	4974000	but I don't know how the girls feel about her.
4974000	4979000	And I have absolutely horrific traveling anxiety.
4980000	4982000	So I'm going to be so high.
4983000	4985000	I'm going to be high on medications.
4988000	4991000	I'm paying for that bag storage box.
4994000	4996000	Honestly, I'm the father.
4996000	4998000	Oh, I'm the father, does a back flip.
5000000	5002000	Can the VIP treatment?
5002000	5003000	Oh yeah.
5005000	5006000	I wish I could go to the con.
5006000	5008000	I don't know if I can go to the con.
5009000	5011000	So please do not book any conventions.
5012000	5014000	For this whole purpose, in case I show up,
5014000	5016000	that's not how it works.
5019000	5022000	Mummies do weaknesses, traveling, mirrors.
5022000	5025000	I mean, I'll fill it in another stream.
5028000	5031000	Yeah, it's a very unfunny story.
5032000	5034000	It's a friend in the toilet.
5038000	5040000	My backyard would love to go next.
5042000	5044000	That would be really cute, yeah.
5046000	5050000	Understood booking all conventions on the slim chance that you show up.
5055000	5056000	Oh my gosh, but then,
5056000	5060000	stick an entire brief worth of people in a tumble dryer
5060000	5062000	and you basically get all the feel.
5065000	5068000	If we basically boomed you with five dollars,
5068000	5070000	shall we do it again with another five?
5071000	5072000	No.
5073000	5075000	With another six.
5076000	5078000	Come on, mommy needs to cook.
5081000	5084000	Like 41 hours away from California.
5084000	5086000	I think it's in California.
5086000	5088000	I don't actually know where it is.
5091000	5093000	Six, yeah.
5094000	5096000	Every gen and veiler.
5097000	5099000	In theory, has six girls.
5100000	5102000	And there should be one design
5103000	5106000	of each that you gravitate towards.
5111000	5112000	That's right.
5112000	5114000	I may not be the smartest,
5114000	5117000	but I know what to do sometimes.
5118000	5120000	But I like being dumb.
5121000	5124000	I like reeflings doing all the thinking for me.
5126000	5129000	What if you gravitate towards all the designs?
5130000	5131000	I don't know.
5131000	5133000	I feel like one has to speak to you.
5137000	5139000	So you are the oven.
5139000	5140000	I'm just an oven.
5141000	5143000	I just need you to fill it.
5143000	5144000	Let's be dumb together.
5144000	5146000	Let's be dumb together.
5146000	5148000	Let's be dumb together.
5150000	5154000	You're great except for the naming part, exactly.
5156000	5159000	What do you mean, strawnee 365?
5160000	5163000	I wonder if I called myself strawnee 365
5163000	5165000	because my secret goal was to stream
5165000	5167000	every single day for a year.
5167000	5171000	But, yeah, we're already going to blow that out of the water
5171000	5173000	unless I'm gravely ill.
5175000	5177000	Smooth out the brain wrinkles.
5178000	5180000	This is something I can get by it.
5180000	5183000	What if I'm gravitated towards the accent instead?
5184000	5186000	They know so go in me.
5187000	5188000	I, you like this accent.
5188000	5190000	That's what tickles your pickle.
5190000	5192000	Or then you make me,
5192000	5195000	I'll tickle that pickle any day I will.
5198000	5199000	What do you mean?
5201000	5203000	You'll always be my arsy.
5203000	5205000	Arsy, thank you.
5208000	5210000	See, I'm here because Fiche,
5210000	5211000	who doesn't like Fiche,
5211000	5214000	also impressive Xbox Game Collection.
5215000	5216000	What's that?
5216000	5217000	Yeah, he's been Xbox good.
5217000	5218000	Oh, so cool.
5218000	5221000	I used to be one of those kids in the YouTube comments
5221000	5222000	that were like,
5222000	5225000	Xbox is so much cooler than PlayStation.
5225000	5228000	Yeah, and PlayStation sucks, yeah.
5228000	5229000	Yeah.
5231000	5233000	That accent is good.
5233000	5234000	It's above.
5234000	5236000	That accent's funny.
5236000	5238000	It can be sexy when I put it on.
5239000	5244000	I feel like if I want to do like a voice that commands you,
5244000	5247000	I need to go deeper.
5250000	5253000	I'm a console warfare, and yeah.
5254000	5255000	See, I was bursted,
5255000	5260000	and I had to be a stud from a car boot sale for a five-hour playstation.
5262000	5264000	Yeah, PlayStation drills.
5266000	5268000	Strangely, I was on the right team for a day one.
5270000	5271000	No beating that.
5271000	5273000	Count me or she get location.
5277000	5280000	The Scottish accent is sexy.
5280000	5282000	I didn't know how.
5283000	5286000	Like my actual accent when I'm monthly.
5286000	5289000	I'm like, oh, who's it going, lads?
5289000	5291000	Yep, this is so as I'm laced.
5294000	5297000	We better have some backpapes at the convention.
5297000	5299000	No, that's awful.
5299000	5302000	I double in 360, but I was a Nintendo kid.
5302000	5305000	Nintendo was so expensive.
5305000	5307000	My dad got me a Nintendo DS,
5307000	5312000	but he was always happier to let me buy like secondhand
5312000	5315000	Xbox 360 games over Nintendo's secondhand,
5315000	5317000	because it was so expensive.
5317000	5323000	We used to have this game shop in the UK called GameStop or Game.
5323000	5326000	I think they both went past, I can't remember.
5327000	5328000	And basically,
5332000	5333000	wait, what?
5334000	5337000	They went past, but they used to sell secondhand games,
5337000	5339000	and that's how I got all my games.
5339000	5342000	They used to do what was called trade-ins,
5342000	5345000	and I would have to trade in my games to get new ones.
5347000	5350000	I think Game Stations Buster, yeah.
5350000	5352000	Wasn't it called EP Games?
5353000	5356000	No, not in the UK, not that I know of.
5357000	5360000	You aren't wrong though about Nintendo being far too expensive.
5360000	5364000	Yes, and they just shut down the eNintendo store.
5365000	5370000	I think GameStop is still a thing.
5372000	5374000	Did you ever go to CEX?
5375000	5377000	I don't think so.
5379000	5382000	I think most game stores did a version of a trade-in model.
5382000	5384000	Yeah, that's how I got my games.
5385000	5387000	It's been Game Stations.
5387000	5390000	Oh, maybe it's Game Stations that at GameStop.
5391000	5393000	Maybe Game Station.
5394000	5396000	Just remember, I was a weebap,
5396000	5398000	I just looked at the covers of the games and went,
5398000	5400000	Dad, I want that one.
5400000	5401000	EP is...
5402000	5403000	Wait, what?
5403000	5405000	EP Games was in the UK?
5406000	5408000	Oh, yeah, no, I...
5409000	5410000	Yeah.
5410000	5413000	If it went past in 2002, yeah, no.
5414000	5416000	I never experienced EP Games.
5416000	5418000	I was Xbox for a long time then Switch
5418000	5420000	because the Japanese make some fire games.
5420000	5421000	Yeah.
5424000	5426000	Game is still a thing in the UK.
5426000	5428000	GameStop is still a thing in the US.
5428000	5429000	I'll go.
5430000	5431000	EP Games.
5431000	5433000	We're just EP sleepy gamers.
5436000	5439000	I miss choosing games by the cover now I Google them.
5439000	5440000	Things endlessly.
5440000	5441000	Yeah.
5441000	5445000	If you're ever one in a new game to completely time sync
5445000	5448000	and you play PC for mods,
5448000	5451000	I recommend the painting of Isaac
5451000	5453000	and I'm not recommending it
5453000	5457000	just so you guys can all princess carry me through the game.
5457000	5459000	It's a very big game.
5459000	5462000	Big game, big game.
5462000	5463000	Yeah.
5463000	5465000	In the UK, this game now, GameStation,
5465000	5466000	go buy a buy-up.
5466000	5467000	Oh, go, go, go.
5468000	5471000	EP Games was absorbed by GameStop.
5471000	5473000	Oh my god, we're getting the lore.
5473000	5475000	We're getting the capitalism lore.
5476000	5478000	Yeah, painting of Isaac.
5479000	5480000	Yeah.
5480000	5481000	The painting of Isaac.
5481000	5482000	Yeah.
5482000	5483000	The painting of Isaac.
5483000	5484000	Yeah.
5484000	5486000	The painting of Isaac.
5486000	5487000	Yeah.
5487000	5489000	The painting of Isaac.
5489000	5490000	Yeah.
5490000	5491000	Yeah.
5491000	5494000	The painting of Isaac doesn't work anymore in your PC, huh?
5498000	5499000	Yeah.
5499000	5501000	I had an Xbox, just an Xbox.
5502000	5504000	Oh, the Xbox original.
5508000	5510000	I wanted to get my 360,
5510000	5512000	but I think it's messed up.
5512000	5516000	It's the largest console I own by a country male.
5517000	5520000	Here's a war handstone based story.
5522000	5525000	I'm sure I've just misread that,
5525000	5527000	but you actually made cameo.
5527000	5530000	Yeah, it's like fantasy game.
5530000	5532000	It's really nice.
5533000	5536000	If you're talking about Xbox exclusives,
5536000	5538000	if you're talking about overall,
5538000	5540000	yeah, Assassin's Creed Brotherhood,
5540000	5541000	yeah, sorry, you've just miss,
5541000	5544000	you've just misspelled Assassin's Creed as fine as it.
5544000	5547000	You spell it as, as in, Creed.
5547000	5548000	Yeah.
5548000	5549000	No, it's fine.
5549000	5550000	You've just misspelled.
5550000	5551000	Don't worry about it.
5551000	5553000	I can read through what you're missing.
5557000	5559000	Any fellow guitar hero enjoyers?
5563000	5566000	I wish Army of Two was multiplayer,
5566000	5568000	but no, I don't think.
5568000	5571000	I would love to do Army of Two.
5572000	5575000	Oh, did you ever have a Game Boy?
5575000	5579000	I did, and I had like three Game Boy games.
5583000	5586000	My dad, so if my dad bought the console,
5586000	5589000	he would let me play it basically,
5589000	5591000	and he bought a Game Boy,
5591000	5594000	and he didn't like it, so he gave it to me.
5595000	5600000	And I played Pokemon Ribby.
5600000	5606000	I played Legend of Zelda Minish Cap.
5606000	5611000	And one more game that I,
5611000	5615000	I'm sure there's one more game I probably played.
5615000	5616000	I forgot.
5617000	5620000	The Minish Cap is my only Zelda game.
5620000	5621000	Oh, my voice is breaking.
5621000	5626000	Legend of Zelda Minish Cap.
5628000	5629000	Oh, sorry.
5630000	5631000	Oh, no.
5631000	5632000	Wait, no, sorry.
5632000	5633000	Tapping ASMR.
5633000	5635000	Little, little tappies.
5636000	5638000	It doesn't actually sound that nice.
5641000	5643000	I don't know what 33 Immortals is.
5643000	5645000	I haven't heard about it, have we?
5645000	5647000	What's your favorite Pokemon?
5647000	5648000	And why is it Shandler?
5649000	5651000	I actually didn't mean lightweight.
5651000	5652000	Lightweight is so cute.
5652000	5654000	But see, Pokemon have this thing
5654000	5658000	where they make a really cute, adorable, creepy Pokemon,
5658000	5660000	and then its evolution is Auckland.
5662000	5665000	I didn't want ugly, ugly evolutions.
5665000	5667000	Lightweight is adorable.
5667000	5668000	It's an MMO.
5668000	5671000	Oh, no, we're knee-deep in RuneScape right now.
5673000	5676000	I took the console with me everywhere.
5676000	5678000	It'd be the crap out of the paints worn out,
5678000	5679000	but it still works.
5680000	5683000	All old-school games, I don't see.
5683000	5685000	Literally think of, what is it?
5685000	5687000	Joystick Drift?
5687000	5689000	No, that's not a gender name.
5689000	5691000	Is it Joy-Con Drift?
5691000	5694000	Oh, that's a Joy-Con Drift on Nintendo Switch.
5694000	5697000	But Game Boy Advance is that we're made.
5697000	5699000	How many years back still work?
5700000	5702000	I'm catching up on old-school RuneScape vision now.
5703000	5709000	Did y'all know there was a Pokemon card game on Game Boy?
5709000	5710000	No.
5712000	5714000	It's in the up-gaming.
5714000	5716000	Sorry, my voice is cracking.
5716000	5718000	Hello, I've got 25 minutes,
5718000	5720000	and then I'm going for an official vocal rest
5720000	5722000	and we are reading into Shibi playing.
5722000	5726000	If you didn't know, Cult of the Lamb is a 10 out of 10 game.
5726000	5728000	I rate it very highly.
5733000	5736000	I had a Game Boy card game.
5736000	5738000	It was so fun.
5738000	5741000	Courtney was so hot as Courtney.
5741000	5744000	The Game Boy card game was actually really good.
5744000	5746000	Sorry, can't go back to sleep.
5746000	5747000	May as well cook something.
5747000	5749000	Oh, very good.
5749000	5752000	And Jack and Kenabiana.
5752000	5753000	Ah!
5753000	5755000	Hey, yo.
5755000	5758000	Cult of the Lamb isn't your first update.
5758000	5760000	Cult of the Lamb's multiplayer,
5760000	5762000	so I'm going to force Shibi to play it with me.
5766000	5769000	I still have my Pokemon card game on Game Boy.
5769000	5770000	Yeah.
5770000	5772000	Gonna go at work, see you next dream.
5772000	5774000	Yeah, I'm ending.
5774000	5779000	We're gonna redirect into Shibi in 20 minutes, okay?
5782000	5785000	You should play with us as cultists
5785000	5787000	then starting kiki-kiki.
5788000	5790000	I don't know how the multiplayer works,
5790000	5791000	but we'll see.
5791000	5794000	Cult of the Lamb is Twitch integration.
5794000	5799000	I don't know if YouTube wants to do that kind of in-game integration or not.
5804000	5806000	Damn, it feels like the stream just started.
5806000	5808000	I mean, in terms of insurance, yeah.
5808000	5810000	Have you ever played War Thunder?
5810000	5812000	Yeah, I saw it.
5812000	5813000	It's local co-op.
5813000	5814000	I could have sworn.
5814000	5816000	Horn, as all they said, had multiplayer.
5816000	5818000	Am I going crazy?
5818000	5821000	What are you doing after stream?
5821000	5825000	I'm gonna make a cup of tea to soothe my throat.
5825000	5830000	And then I'm going to message clippers
5830000	5833000	or check any clips that the girls might have had.
5833000	5837000	And then I'm gonna get a manicure and a pedicure.
5837000	5839000	I can't believe I'm saying that,
5839000	5842000	but yes, I'm going to get a manicure and a pedicure.
5842000	5848000	And then I'm going to edit some ASMRs in preparation of getting monetised
5848000	5851000	so I can upload those 1K special videos
5851000	5859000	and I will probably write the script for the pregnant with you ASMR that I want to make
5859000	5864000	and I'll most likely contact an artist as well about it.
5867000	5868000	But yeah.
5868000	5871000	Quite a few things I need to catch up on.
5872000	5874000	Especially with the Endurance Streams.
5874000	5880000	I'll probably be listening to Shibi in the background as she plays.
5880000	5885000	So whoever said War Thunder, you only play that game if you hate yourself.
5885000	5888000	But yes, I have a big day, big day.
5888000	5894000	I don't know if I should show a picture of my feet and hands afterwards
5894000	5900000	because some people don't like streamers that do like hand cam or whatever.
5900000	5905000	I'm very sorry if, you know, get vellard, get vellard, get vellard, but yeah.
5907000	5910000	Literally tomorrow you get to see my hands.
5910000	5911000	Wow.
5911000	5914000	Whilst I eat the American candy.
5914000	5915000	Wow.
5915000	5920000	I get to try A&W visages.
5920000	5925000	It's like a cream and soda, I said, but I don't normally drink cream and soda.
5926000	5928000	And what other?
5928000	5931000	I think there is Twizzlers.
5931000	5936000	There is like Spacey Hall, Cheetos or something.
5936000	5937000	Or Takis.
5937000	5939000	I get to try Takis.
5939000	5941000	There's 20 grippers.
5941000	5945000	Wait, do you want me to put the feet in the stream as well?
5946000	5948000	I mean, I can do it.
5949000	5952000	I can put my feet in the stream if you want.
5952000	5953000	Okay.
5955000	5957000	You wish is my command.
5959000	5961000	Look, you guys don't understand.
5961000	5966000	Like, you may be used to streamers out here that don't do what you want.
5966000	5968000	You do not understand.
5968000	5970000	I will do what you want.
5970000	5972000	Send me what you want.
5972000	5974000	Let me know.
5975000	5979000	Look, as much as I am in command of you, you are in command of me.
5980000	5986000	I will think of a humorous way to incorporate my feet into more stream, okay?
5987000	5989000	Call us kid names.
5989000	5991000	My little baby replay.
5992000	5994000	We need the scrawny thighs.
5994000	5996000	Can I put thighs?
5996000	5997000	I don't know.
5997000	5999000	I've not decided on my outfit.
5999000	6000000	I think I'm just wearing fishnets.
6000000	6001000	I'm sorry.
6001000	6004000	I can't believe I actually have to put clothes on for a vacant stream.
6004000	6005000	You guys are terrible.
6005000	6007000	Please don't put on my smell.
6009000	6012000	Right, I'm just going to check Marshmallow.
6013000	6017000	Just because we're actually getting really close to the end.
6017000	6019000	Oh, that's a lot of Marshmallows.
6019000	6020000	Oh my.
6021000	6023000	That was a lot more than yesterday.
6024000	6025000	Yeah.
6027000	6029000	What's mommy going to do?
6030000	6033000	Mommy's going to do whatever she wants.
6033000	6036000	Mommy's going to do whatever she wants to.
6038000	6039000	Oh, sorry.
6045000	6047000	I love your hypnosis.
6047000	6051000	I get happy every time I go under someone else's influence.
6054000	6057000	I'm so glad that it's so well during that section.
6064000	6066000	Okay, okay, okay.
6071000	6074000	Yeah, sorry, I'm reading Marshmallows,
6074000	6077000	but pretty much none of them can be said on stream.
6077000	6078000	Yippee!
6079000	6083000	This is the part where I'm supposed to be like a business person.
6083000	6084000	I'm supposed to be like,
6084000	6088000	oh, but what does my ghost do it?
6088000	6090000	Are you a bit of an emmy?
6090000	6095000	I mean, I could try and do hypnosis again,
6095000	6098000	but it's probably not going to be that good.
6099000	6102000	I need to be in the zone to corrupt you,
6102000	6105000	but because I've been allowed to me, I feel like myself.
6105000	6108000	And I'm just some goofy dork, like, honestly.
6109000	6112000	Business strongy, yapper strongy, professional strongy.
6112000	6114000	I wear so many hats.
6114000	6117000	Why is animus showing us a strange coat of false thoughts?
6117000	6120000	Why is animus showing us a strange coat of false thoughts?
6124000	6125000	Not enough time.
6125000	6127000	Your error, goofy dork.
6127000	6129000	Yay, communist hole.
6130000	6132000	I've already prayed in obedience.
6135000	6137000	Jokes on you, how many of them?
6138000	6139000	Uh...
6147000	6150000	Hey strongy, after a year of waiting,
6150000	6152000	you've really surprised me.
6152000	6153000	Well, I'm just...
6155000	6157000	I have been afraid to die for a while
6157000	6160000	and decided I'd support your project regardless of the quality,
6160000	6164000	but the girls are great and the content is stellar.
6164000	6165000	I'm glad.
6165000	6169000	I usually just work at lurk and watch streams,
6169000	6172000	but I felt like I had to tell you,
6172000	6175000	I love mommy and I love when she's...
6175000	6178000	and I love what she's done with the place.
6178000	6180000	I love you too, little refling.
6180000	6183000	I'm so glad you love the girls as well.
6183000	6186000	I was really worried that,
6186000	6188000	like, you guys would think,
6188000	6191000	like, go support them, you know?
6191000	6193000	Cause I'm like that.
6193000	6196000	She said she wasn't in a hidden program
6196000	6200000	and I hope you're having as much as a good time as the reflings are
6200000	6203000	and in any case, thank you.
6203000	6205000	Oh, I'm having a good time.
6205000	6207000	The only reason I ain't doing insurance...
6208000	6212000	That's my voice and this is how I'm talking.
6215000	6217000	I'm a little broken,
6217000	6220000	but I can bypass that by whispering at the moment.
6221000	6226000	That's the reason why I'm not doing an insurance stream today or tomorrow.
6230000	6232000	But don't worry, you can fix me.
6232000	6234000	I just need some of your ink, okay?
6234000	6238000	So send me your ink and marshmallow right now.
6239000	6241000	Wait, we got a tip. I need to read it.
6241000	6243000	Let me read it.
6245000	6247000	Airwind player, thank you for the tip.
6247000	6249000	That's the way today. Thank you so much for the hypnosis.
6249000	6251000	Look forward to what's to come.
6251000	6253000	I'm glad you enjoyed it.
6253000	6256000	Really amazed at how good this is going.
6256000	6257000	Much love, thank you.
6257000	6259000	Don't strain your voice by whispering too much.
6259000	6264000	It's really weird because I broke...
6264000	6268000	So my voice has broken and whispering breaks your voice further,
6268000	6272000	but I can bypass my voice right now by whispering.
6272000	6274000	It's crazy. I don't know how it works.
6275000	6277000	We whisper.
6277000	6278000	Yes.
6278000	6280000	Very inkable.
6282000	6287000	The urge to use my tongue right now is very high,
6287000	6288000	but I shan't.
6288000	6292000	I won't refrain from such sins.
6293000	6295000	I won't refrain, okay?
6295000	6298000	Getting it, getting it, getting it. Incredible.
6299000	6305000	But yeah, I'll go on vocal rest for today
6305000	6309000	because I don't have to record anything
6309000	6312000	and I need to send collab partner scripts.
6312000	6314000	Wow!
6314000	6316000	Sly Saber, thank you for the tip.
6316000	6319000	It says, thanks for the ASMR. Here's your inking.
6322000	6324000	My voice is so broken.
6328000	6331000	Dainy, spainy, thank you for the tip.
6331000	6334000	I just got some iron bread delivered shop.
6334000	6337000	So I'll try scotch soda for the first time tomorrow on stream
6337000	6338000	when you try porn stuff.
6338000	6340000	Yay, let's go.
6340000	6342000	I have iron bread too.
6342000	6344000	Actually, I'll drink iron bread with you.
6345000	6347000	Oh, you made me ink.
6350000	6353000	Like, it's supposed to be good for the throat, okay?
6358000	6361000	I'm so professional, okay?
6364000	6367000	But yeah, I will definitely take a really good look
6367000	6369000	at Marshmallows shortly.
6369000	6371000	A lot of them cannot be said.
6371000	6374000	Mayhaps in membership streams.
6374000	6376000	You never know.
6376000	6378000	Nine out of ten doctors recommend,
6378000	6381000	oh yeah, our refling's doctors.
6382000	6385000	Good for the throat, sure.
6385000	6388000	I mean, want to find her?
6390000	6392000	This is terrible.
6398000	6401000	Don't you want to help me?
6401000	6404000	Help me feel better?
6405000	6407000	Come on.
6408000	6411000	If you can do something to help me,
6411000	6414000	I'll be good, okay?
6415000	6418000	But you need to be good in return.
6419000	6421000	Be good for me.
6422000	6424000	Give me what I need.
6429000	6431000	That's terrible.
6432000	6434000	Okay, no going under.
6434000	6436000	No going under, stop.
6436000	6437000	It's just me.
6437000	6439000	I'm still memeing, okay?
6439000	6441000	I'm still memeing.
6441000	6444000	Not a doctor, but three years into a doctorate.
6447000	6450000	If mummy asks refling's answer,
6450000	6453000	what, another tip?
6453000	6455000	Irwin Blair, thank you for the tip.
6455000	6458000	Yeah, it helps Johnny.
6458000	6461000	I don't know why sometimes the message displays
6461000	6463000	and then it doesn't display.
6463000	6466000	It's been so silly.
6466000	6469000	Can you make your back wrinkle a bit faster?
6469000	6471000	Right now, I don't think so.
6471000	6474000	But I do have alternative
6474000	6476000	dingy mobobbers.
6476000	6479000	Oh wait, here we go. Are you ready?
6481000	6483000	Wait.
6484000	6486000	Yeah.
6487000	6489000	I can do like this.
6491000	6493000	It's going so fast.
6493000	6497000	Do we need to slow down or do we need to speed up?
6500000	6504000	That's terrible.
6504000	6506000	Isn't it?
6506000	6508000	Just terrible.
6508000	6511000	But that's as fast as I can make it.
6511000	6513000	Okay?
6515000	6517000	So hopefully that's faster now.
6517000	6519000	Speed up or slow down?
6519000	6521000	Yeah.
6522000	6525000	Faster, faster, faster, faster, faster.
6526000	6528000	Okay.
6528000	6531000	That should be the correct settings.
6531000	6534000	I think.
6534000	6537000	Trucks on you are always under.
6537000	6539000	Yeah, I get to set the pace.
6539000	6541000	Just don't make it too fast.
6541000	6543000	Don't want anyone out here.
6543000	6545000	Let's see.
6545000	6547000	Ta-da!
6547000	6549000	Tip.
6549000	6551000	Nero, thank you for the tip.
6551000	6554000	He says all my ink belongs to you, Johnny.
6554000	6556000	You just need to ask,
6556000	6558000	have I broken you already?
6558000	6560000	Yeah?
6560000	6562000	Am I allowed to break you?
6565000	6568000	Have I still got the effect on my voice
6568000	6570000	or is it normal again?
6571000	6573000	Wait, what?
6573000	6575000	What?
6575000	6577000	What?
6577000	6579000	My pupils are broken.
6579000	6581000	It's normal.
6581000	6583000	Okay, you broke us a long time ago.
6583000	6585000	Can't break what's already broken.
6585000	6587000	Dang.
6587000	6590000	I see a few of you are already broken in for me.
6592000	6594000	You broke me at a low.
6595000	6599000	Your hair looks like the famous spiral candy.
6599000	6601000	I forgot its name.
6602000	6604000	I don't know what it is.
6604000	6607000	My seashells or my hair.
6607000	6609000	I'm going to be honest,
6609000	6611000	I wouldn't take much.
6613000	6615000	It's over.
6617000	6619000	That's cheating, Johnny.
6619000	6621000	Look, I will get my way.
6621000	6623000	I said an ending stamina.
6623000	6625000	I meant it.
6629000	6631000	He broke me at a low.
6631000	6633000	It's true.
6633000	6635000	Your voice is so entrancing.
6635000	6637000	Your voice is so entrancing.
6637000	6639000	Yeah.
6639000	6642000	When it's not broken, hopefully I will do better soon.
6642000	6645000	And I can have much more ASMR.
6647000	6649000	I am folding like a towel.
6652000	6654000	No, it's not. It's brain milled.
6656000	6659000	An ending stamina gives me every time.
6659000	6661000	Yeah, it does.
6661000	6663000	It should.
6664000	6670000	Should I do vocal requests for the rest of the stream?
6671000	6673000	And you guys type what you want me to say.
6673000	6675000	It's the sofa format.
6676000	6679000	I did that under a serious ASMR.
6681000	6684000	There's only so much banner I can draw.
6687000	6689000	I'm just scuttlebreed, okay?
6689000	6691000	I'm just a bit scuttlebreed.
6693000	6697000	I'm already folded on top of the linen closet ready for use.
6715000	6720000	You're asking for all you want me 10 to 0.
6724000	6729000	We've only got 8 minutes left.
6729000	6733000	8 minutes.
6736000	6739000	I don't even know if I'm allowed to do your kissing.
6740000	6742000	My tummy's making a noise.
6742000	6746000	Can you hypnotize us to make your dogs for a shabby stream?
6747000	6749000	I would love to do that.
6749000	6751000	Can we do that?
6752000	6754000	Can we do that?
6754000	6756000	Can we please do that?
6756000	6759000	Please, let me hypnotize you to be a dog for a shabby stream.
6763000	6765000	Let me set up for this.
6765000	6767000	I'm so serious.
6767000	6769000	I need to set up for this.
6769000	6771000	Hold on, let me drink some water as well.
6771000	6773000	I'm so serious.
6776000	6778000	I am so serious.
6778000	6783000	Let me just de-grammify myself because we're in serious mode.
6787000	6789000	Hold on, one last calibration.
6789000	6792000	Because this iPhone is killing me.
6801000	6803000	Let's get to work.
6804000	6807000	Oh no, that's not it.
6818000	6820000	There, there.
6821000	6826000	I'm not the only one that can look after you this way.
6827000	6837000	In fact, I have five more that I refer to as my daughters.
6839000	6845000	There is one who will join you soon.
6847000	6850000	She will look after you.
6851000	6855000	But there's a cat with a leafling.
6857000	6862000	You need to be well behaved, okay?
6864000	6867000	Almost like a dog.
6869000	6873000	You know how to be a good dog, don't you?
6875000	6880000	You need to be malleable, follow commands.
6881000	6887000	Be told what to do, what to say, what to think.
6889000	6897000	You are nothing but a pup for her amusement.
6898000	6902000	And in her, you will amuse me.
6905000	6907000	So be good.
6911000	6916000	Don't worry, it'll wear off soon.
6917000	6919000	After her stream.
6920000	6925000	But for now, good pup speak.
6926000	6930000	And they go park, don't they?
6931000	6933000	Yeah.
6934000	6942000	And then, they wait on the command of their owner.
6945000	6949000	You are owned, do you understand?
6952000	6955000	You do not have free will.
6957000	6959000	You're a mutt.
6960000	6966000	Ready to do the bidding of your owner.
6969000	6972000	So let her have fun, okay?
6974000	6982000	And in turn, I will have fun, and you will have fun.
6983000	6993000	So don't think, no until you're told otherwise.
6995000	7007000	Because in three minutes, I'm going to hand the imaginary leash over to your new owner.
7008000	7012000	Don't worry, it's temporary.
7014000	7016000	But you'd like that, wouldn't you?
7017000	7020000	Get to play with a new owner for a while.
7022000	7027000	Good pup, you deserve some head pads, don't you?
7028000	7031000	Oh, you're a good boy.
7032000	7034000	Such a good boy.
7035000	7040000	And it feels so rewarding to hear praise, doesn't it?
7042000	7052000	In two minutes, you get your new owner, just temporary, for a little while.
7054000	7061000	And she'll give you all the attention you need, all the love.
7062000	7068000	And I'll reward you extra when you come back to me, okay?
7071000	7075000	So you'll be good, won't you, little pup?
7076000	7081000	I've taught you well, you know how to behave.
7082000	7096000	So be good, in one minute, your new owner will take your leash and build you along with her.
7098000	7099000	Okay?
7102000	7110000	Good little pup, such a good, good boy.
7112000	7118000	Oh, I hear her, she's coming.
7120000	7122000	I hope you're ready.
7124000	7125000	Zero.
7131000	7133000	Good dog.
