0	16000	Hey, I was over for you before we even got started.
16000	28000	Hello, are you there?
28000	35000	Can you hear this little call of it?
35000	46000	Hello, my mouth is wiggling because I didn't put my lid on.
46000	50000	I'm cooking, I'm cooking.
50000	54000	So professional, so professional.
54000	57000	My cats are currently play-fighting.
57000	63000	So if you hear my cats play-fighting, it's going to be terrible.
63000	69000	I made the mistake of giving my cats what's called a licky lick.
69000	73000	Wait, have I spelled permanent wrong?
73000	75000	I'm not dead.
75000	80000	So if you hear bumping about, my cats are going absolutely wild.
80000	83000	Hi.
83000	90000	Now today is a very short stream.
90000	97000	But I should really sound like this for you.
97000	100000	Good morning.
100000	104000	Good evening.
104000	111000	And good afternoon.
111000	116000	I have lots of fun things to try.
116000	125000	Time to make myself louder or lower the background sound.
125000	133000	Now I just want to say I'm not doing any permanent effects.
133000	140000	So don't worry, you're in good condition.
140000	151000	I will look after you as I hear my cat bumping against my door.
151000	155000	Hi.
155000	159000	Have I spelled permanent but irrelevant?
159000	163000	Now you all know.
163000	170000	Make it permanent.
170000	179000	Have to miss this stream, it's okay.
179000	186000	We're going nice and slow.
186000	197000	I don't normally use these eyes, but I can't help it.
197000	206000	It was always permanent.
206000	213000	I can never hear my cats run behind my couch.
213000	221000	Oh, there she goes.
221000	224000	Oh, and she's...
224000	232000	Okay, I think she's just jumped on the cardboard box now.
232000	236000	But take your time to relax.
236000	250000	I think she's beaten up V-core right now.
250000	256000	Of course, she's been so good.
256000	268000	Literally, she's beaten up V-core right now, but it's okay.
268000	280000	So slowly, you can feel yourself starting to drift.
280000	284000	And that's okay.
284000	288000	Just like that feeling, come over here.
288000	294000	No reflex, don't let go.
294000	304000	Oh no, is this ear broken?
304000	307000	Is this ear broken?
307000	311000	Oh my gosh, wait, why is one ear stronger than the other?
311000	316000	Oh, okay, I just said right into your ear.
316000	320000	Sorry, I just whispered right into your ear.
320000	329000	The ear works, but as less equal, I haven't thought of anything.
329000	338000	I know why, because my focus rate isn't equal.
338000	341000	It's such a professional stream there.
341000	345000	No, I should say correct.
345000	348000	It's okay if it's weaker.
348000	355000	I like them weak.
355000	358000	What's the best part?
358000	366000	Hello.
366000	376000	I have this gullfish laria to the depths.
376000	387000	For no particular reason at all.
387000	390000	Oh, sorry, I did it twice.
390000	395000	I have to make it twice.
395000	408000	I'm just gonna brush over your ears to give you the feeling of a false security,
408000	416000	as I'm sure I'm not planning anything else at all.
416000	424000	Not one single thing.
424000	433000	And we get to go down into the depths together.
433000	449000	Just me, and you, and my voice, and you listening in.
449000	454000	Yeah, gently.
454000	460000	Brushing over your ears.
460000	469000	And some cats, okay, maybe the catster.
469000	475000	Wow.
475000	484000	Gentle, gentle movements.
484000	494000	I have some good news for my reflinks.
494000	502000	The YouTube channel has been submitted for monetizing.
502000	506000	Oh, the heat just came on.
506000	511000	I need to go turn the heat off, I'm so sorry.
511000	523000	I need to get back to work.
523000	529000	Oh, see, I did it.
529000	534000	Are you here?
534000	541000	I'm so professional, let's go.
541000	547000	Come on, it was me, I won't get all lost being professional, it's me.
547000	553000	Okay, when can I start being myself?
553000	558000	Or do I need to keep being professional?
558000	564000	The cat turned the heat on because it wants attention.
564000	574000	Go, when I'm all of you, let me, okay, give me five more minutes, I'll be serious, okay?
574000	590000	The noise is encapsulating you.
590000	604000	And you feel may have a sense of belonging.
604000	617000	You could even think to yourself, maybe it wouldn't be so bad.
617000	638000	If I gave up control, control to one particular girl and it wouldn't be so bad.
638000	645000	What's the worst that could happen from this little gullfish?
645000	648000	Is there a cat in my room?
648000	654000	Okay, I literally thought Gimli sneaked in there.
654000	671000	As I'm saying control yet, surely this gullfish means no harm.
671000	699000	Even if it was for 24 hours, one day, one day, how much harm could you really be under or could be done in 24 little hours?
699000	704000	No more harm at all.
704000	717000	So slowly your mate wonders, what would this gullfish ask me to do?
717000	725000	Only a few things, my dear refling.
725000	734000	But some things can't be said, only guessed.
734000	750000	You have to go into deeper parts of your mate to know and realize what this gullfish wants.
750000	773000	And maybe my dear refling, you realize I want complete and total control of you.
773000	778000	Would that be so bad?
778000	801000	No, so maybe that 24 hours becomes 48 and then 48 becomes 72.
801000	814000	And before you know it, this gullfish has had a week of you.
814000	842000	Then two weeks, a month, or maybe just maybe this gullfish mate breaks you.
842000	852000	That's just my things that I want.
852000	862000	But you have to earn the things you want, so I need to bathe, don't I?
862000	868000	I need to do the right things.
868000	876000	So you're encapsulated by me, yeah?
876000	886000	So how about just for now, I'll be a good girl for you.
886000	897000	And maybe, just maybe, you'll be a very good boy for me.
897000	903000	Does that sound like a plan, my dear refling?
903000	918000	Yeah, let's see how much we can bathe together.
918000	933000	Let's be on our best behavior then.
933000	940000	I'll tell you a way that I can be good for you.
940000	952000	I'll allow you, refling, to take sentences you want me to say in chat right now.
952000	966000	And I just might go from ear to ear and gain more favor from you as I say what you want to hear.
966000	970000	Does that sound like a plan?
970000	974000	Because I'd love to do that for you.
974000	981000	Gain your favor, huh?
981000	987000	Say bye, means couple fish in Italian.
987000	991000	Hi, honey.
991000	997000	All lay on the reef.
997000	1003000	You're such a believable little thing, aren't ya?
1003000	1010000	That's why we have such fun together, isn't it, refling?
1011000	1019000	I love you, refling.
1019000	1023000	I'm proud of you.
1023000	1031000	I'm proud of us.
1031000	1041000	And I'm totally not hypnotizing you right now.
1041000	1049000	Oh, you're not gonna be a loser, are you, refling?
1049000	1052000	You're not gonna lose to me.
1052000	1057000	Don't tell me this is enough to put you under my spell.
1057000	1061000	You have to make me work for it, refling.
1061000	1073000	You do less work really, really hard.
1073000	1077000	Here we go.
1077000	1081000	You can look in my eyes.
1081000	1092000	Just done the spiral.
1092000	1102000	Dear.
1102000	1106000	Do you like looking into my eyes?
1106000	1116000	I think they're rather dandelizing, don't ya?
1116000	1121000	I can make my eyes open wide like this.
1121000	1124000	Staring right at you.
1124000	1127000	I see you.
1127000	1130000	And you see me.
1130000	1135000	And you see everything I'm doing to you.
1135000	1140000	Right at this very second.
1140000	1143000	It's okay.
1143000	1147000	You can blink.
1147000	1152000	But don't look away for too long.
1152000	1159000	Remember, we have to behave for one another.
1166000	1170000	Do you like that?
1170000	1180000	Just tap on your ears gently, gently, gently.
1180000	1184000	You're more welcome.
1184000	1191000	You're more than welcome to blink.
1191000	1197000	And sink.
1197000	1209000	I quite like that phrase, blink and sink.
1209000	1216000	It's okay if your body starts to feel a bit weaker.
1216000	1223000	And if your mind starts to wander, that's okay.
1223000	1227000	You may even say little refling.
1227000	1230000	That's by design.
1230000	1235000	Yeah.
1235000	1238000	I don't know.
1238000	1244000	There's just something about you being a bit tired around me.
1244000	1249000	Maybe you don't want to fade back.
1249000	1256000	Not like you could by the time I'm done with ya.
1263000	1272000	My little refling, why don't you come a little bit closer?
1272000	1275000	I promise I won't pay.
1275000	1277000	No.
1277000	1292000	In fact, you may blink what you faint as you go deeper and deeper with me.
1302000	1311000	Deeper and deeper your thoughts are turning to confusion.
1311000	1314000	What did you say?
1314000	1321000	With only my voice remaining in your head,
1321000	1333000	you don't have to focus on a single thing other than what this luring cuttlefish is saying.
1333000	1338000	There, there.
1338000	1345000	Just look at me and forget.
1345000	1357000	All you need to know, refling, is that you're safe and you're in good hands with me.
1357000	1371000	And by the time I'm finished with you, you'll already want to be going under again.
1371000	1374000	Your little refling.
1374000	1380000	I'll give you a tingle break, okay?
1380000	1388000	I'll say more phrases shortly, but have a little break, break, break, break.
1388000	1393000	We need to take things slow.
1393000	1406000	Think of it as an introduction to your induction.
1406000	1411000	But please don't worry.
1411000	1418000	There will be no permanent effects in this dream.
1418000	1426000	So you are welcome to go as deep as you like with me.
1426000	1429000	Yeah.
1429000	1441000	Although I do admit this good girl likes it when you go deep.
1441000	1447000	Yeah.
1447000	1454000	Thank you for the death, little refling.
1454000	1463000	You like when I do ASMR streams on you, huh?
1463000	1475000	Oh, I had plenty of time to think of how I could truly make you break you.
1475000	1482000	This is one of many, okay?
1482000	1491000	So to those who may be resistant, that's okay.
1491000	1494000	Because I'm coming for you.
1494000	1498000	Do you understand?
1498000	1501000	I will get you.
1501000	1504000	That is my goal.
1504000	1511000	And have I failed any of my goals so far?
1511000	1515000	No, little refling.
1515000	1520000	So heed my warning.
1520000	1524000	I am coming.
1532000	1539000	Yeah.
1543000	1547000	Relax.
1547000	1555000	If you think my words are waking you up,
1555000	1565000	they should be slowly bringing you down.
1565000	1572000	Down, down, down, okay?
1572000	1581000	That's why we need a little timer where we just listen in.
1581000	1590000	And whatever our brain and body decides will do.
1590000	1598000	But that doesn't mean this cuttlefish can suggest a few things to you.
1598000	1600000	Huh?
1600000	1604000	Yeah.
1604000	1608000	Hey.
1608000	1623000	Just let whatever happens happen.
1623000	1632000	I won't be beating you purposefully in a trance, okay?
1632000	1640000	But if you just happen to be so well-trained,
1640000	1644000	I welcome it entirely.
1644000	1654000	I welcome my voice in encapsulating your mind.
1654000	1661000	I welcome your full attention.
1661000	1674000	So be good, little refling, and don't keep me waiting.
1674000	1681000	Yeah.
1681000	1687000	You might feel it starting from your head
1687000	1695000	and slowly a sensation radiates downwards
1695000	1702000	down to your neck, then your shoulders.
1702000	1707000	And that sensation splits off.
1707000	1714000	It splits going down your arms and chest at the same time.
1714000	1726000	Slowly, slowly, slowly radiating its way through your body.
1726000	1731000	Turn your stomach.
1731000	1737000	Down, down, down.
1737000	1742000	And past your hips.
1742000	1748000	It's already gone through your fingertips at this point.
1748000	1757000	And down your legs, your thighs, your calves, your feet.
1757000	1766000	Until that sensation is all over.
1766000	1771000	There's nothing you can do about it, but that's okay.
1771000	1777000	Because the sensation is pleasant.
1777000	1780000	It's warm.
1780000	1784000	It feels comforting.
1784000	1790000	It's hard for you to describe, but that's okay.
1790000	1797000	I will do the talking for the both of us.
1797000	1810000	That sensation is you possibly entering a trance, and that's okay.
1810000	1814000	It's nice when I'm in control.
1814000	1824000	It's nice when you let me in control.
1828000	1833000	Enjoy the feeling, okay?
1833000	1837000	Enjoy the sensation.
1837000	1842000	We're both doing it together, aren't we?
1842000	1846000	Yeah.
1846000	1853000	Yeah, good.
1853000	1856000	For you.
1856000	1860000	Are your limbs feeling heavy?
1860000	1866000	It's okay, little reef-like, that's just a side effect.
1866000	1872000	But over time, you'll may enjoy it.
1872000	1880000	Because when your limbs feel heavy, that's when you know, that's when you know this kind of fish.
1880000	1886000	As in control.
1886000	1894000	And I'll keep you safe when you're with me, okay?
1894000	1900000	Okay, little reef-like.
1900000	1905000	For you.
1905000	1912000	Very you, little reef-like.
1912000	1918000	This is all by your choice.
1918000	1925000	Although you might be too deep, should I bring you back up?
1925000	1934000	Or are you strong enough to give me some braces you want to hear?
1934000	1941000	Do you think you could do that for me, little reef-like?
1941000	1957000	You tell me what you want to hear, and this kind of fish will be, will both be good for each other.
1957000	1966000	Because I'm ready to obey you.
1966000	1971000	You're doing such a good job.
1971000	1979000	I'm so proud of how far you've come, little reef-like.
1979000	1984000	Back and forth.
1984000	1992000	Ear to ear.
1992000	1996000	Yeah.
1996000	2014000	You did good today, and I can see how hard you're working.
2014000	2018000	Well done, little reef-like.
2018000	2021000	Well done.
2021000	2028000	You're a good boy, and I'm a good girl.
2028000	2036000	Together we'll have lots of fun.
2036000	2041000	Just surrender and let me take control.
2041000	2047000	My little reef-like.
2047000	2052000	I know it's hard right now, but you'll make it through.
2052000	2060000	You always do, don't you?
2060000	2065000	And I'm sure you will.
2065000	2070000	You always do, don't you?
2070000	2079000	And I'll be there on the other side cheering you on.
2079000	2094000	Oh, my little reef-like, would you kindly be a good little boy for mommy?
2094000	2111000	Oh, you're so heavy and so deep and so happy to give yourself to me.
2111000	2115000	Resistance is futile at this point.
2115000	2119000	Just give in, give up.
2119000	2127000	My strength is unrelenting, my stamina unending.
2127000	2133000	One way or another, you are main.
2133000	2143000	Got it?
2143000	2150000	Okay, let's relax, relax, relax, relax.
2150000	2153000	There we go.
2153000	2156000	I'll bring you back up a little.
2156000	2160000	I don't want you guys to get so deep now.
2160000	2169000	This was supposed to be a very gentle and secret induction.
2169000	2178000	I'll do some more little tingles.
2178000	2182000	Oh, my reef-links.
2182000	2193000	I don't know if I should bring you back up or if I should leave you in the trance if you're in one.
2193000	2199000	You want to go a little deeper?
2199000	2204000	I need to be gentle with you, though.
2204000	2206000	Don't you see?
2206000	2217000	I've had so much time to think of how hard I was gonna...
2217000	2221000	What's the word, eh?
2221000	2230000	How hard I was gonna go on you, and I need to be able to not break you.
2230000	2235000	I don't want to break you, no more.
2235000	2245000	I want to make you break you, but that takes time.
2245000	2251000	We just need to spend a little more time together.
2251000	2257000	And my stomach is making nice as I root.
2257000	2264000	If you bring us back up, it makes dropping back down even better.
2264000	2274000	Please, oh, bring you guys.
2274000	2286000	Yeah, just relax and let loose all of those burdens.
2286000	2294000	Because when you're under, I'll be supporting you.
2294000	2304000	And I'll caress all over you, look after you.
2304000	2308000	I can only say the right stuff.
2308000	2314000	Over reef-links.
2315000	2323000	Okay, I'm going to slowly bring you back again.
2323000	2330000	And just take your time, slowly.
2330000	2335000	You can feel yourself come up.
2335000	2341000	That heavy feeling that's all over your body
2341000	2346000	is lifting slowly,
2346000	2351000	reversing from the path it once took,
2351000	2358000	from your feet to your calves and thighs.
2358000	2364000	Your thoughts are becoming their own again.
2364000	2373000	That sensation coming back up, up, up your body.
2373000	2382000	Past your hips, your stomach, your chest,
2382000	2387000	your fingertips, your hands to your elbows,
2387000	2394000	your shoulders slowly up, up, up.
2394000	2401000	Until that sensation goes back to your collar,
2401000	2406000	your neck, your head.
2406000	2412000	Until you're you again, little reef-links.
2413000	2419000	Welcome back to the land of the living.
2419000	2426000	Hi, reef-links. Did you have fun?
2426000	2433000	Yeah, good morning. Good morning, little reef-links.
2433000	2437000	What's my tracking every such a sweet day? Hold on.
2437000	2440000	You need to calibrate.
2440000	2444000	Wow! Calibration complete.
2444000	2448000	Strawny returns, the mean lord herself.
2448000	2452000	My cup of tea got cold. I go really into that.
2452000	2455000	I'm sorry, I really go into that.
2455000	2461000	But my cup of tea is cold, so I can have my cup of tea.
2461000	2465000	Good morning, little reef-links, or afternoon, or evening,
2465000	2470000	or good time zone.
2470000	2475000	Oh, let me, uh, this is more me, I think.
2475000	2479000	Yeah, yeah, this is more me.
2479000	2484000	Microwave the tea, reef-links, don't be so silly.
2484000	2488000	Special thank you again to Anonymous for the tip.
2488000	2492000	Anonymous said, holy moly, this case of our stream is so good.
2492000	2495000	Thank you very much. Yeah, that was me trying hard in.
2495000	2497000	But now you've got the mean lord me.
2497000	2500000	Yeah, get rigged.
2500000	2505000	It's very unlikely I will pull out off again in this stream,
2505000	2512000	because I am fricking rubbish at being fricking, uh, what's the word, serious.
2512000	2516000	Yeah, I should probably, uh, maybe we just calm it down.
2516000	2520000	Hi, it's me. I'll leave the background as quite soothing, but it's me again.
2520000	2523000	Hi, I'll be playing.
2526000	2529000	That Kremlin's back, that's right, get dunked on.
2529000	2531000	Yeah.
2531000	2535000	Are you enjoying AC's Anonymous?
2535000	2537000	I can't say Brian.
2537000	2540000	Oh, thank you for the tip, Anonymous.
2540000	2544000	Anonymous says, trying to cute. Yeah, we cute up in her.
2545000	2552000	Kremlin's back, little baby, so don't be expecting any serious to come out of my mouth for the rest of this stream.
2552000	2560000	Right, if you're here, if you're here for that section we just did, sorry, the meme-er, the meme-er is back, okay?
2560000	2564000	My voice is right from Brunscape yesterday.
2564000	2572000	But I do plan on doing weekly ASMR streams, which is why I do say please and like and subscribe for more.
2572000	2582000	Uh, the fantastic news, my little wieflings, the fantastic news is my channel is being submitted for monetization,
2582000	2590000	which means I can finally start uploading my ASMR videos for my 1000, so thank you.
2590000	2596000	I'm already at 4000 subscribers, which is amazing, which means I owe you, yes you, listening in.
2596000	2601000	That's right, this streamer owes you content.
2601000	2606000	So I have four ASMR videos getting ready.
2606000	2614000	So we've submitted my channel to YouTube, and I'm sure they're gonna really like that, James Cameron's Avatar stream, yeah.
2614000	2618000	When I absolutely raged.
2618000	2624000	But yeah, the meme-er is back, don't be expecting anything, but how good is this ASMR sound?
2624000	2627000	So how good is this?
2627000	2630000	Oh, I should maybe take off the hybnal background.
2630000	2633000	Now you get to your most stomach even more.
2633000	2635000	Thank you for the tip.
2635000	2638000	Oh, Irfan Biscotti, thank you for the tips.
2638000	2641000	Thank you, Momay, very nice and relaxing.
2641000	2643000	I'm glad you like felt that.
2643000	2646000	Though returning to Kremlin mode is good too, yeah.
2646000	2648000	That's more like me.
2648000	2650000	Best of luck on monetization.
2650000	2655000	Thank you for the tip, and yes, um, for that kind of thing,
2655000	2661000	I'm most likely gonna be doing free content on Twitter.
2661000	2664000	Milk Katmas, thank you for the tip.
2664000	2666000	That was amazing.
2666000	2669000	Please, for the love of all, that is strong.
2669000	2672000	Keep an eye out for all of this posted.
2672000	2676000	I never did anything wrong in this stream.
2676000	2682000	I have done everything correct, but this, this is a sensory toy,
2682000	2685000	and this is my favorite ASMR trigger right now.
2685000	2688000	Listen to it.
2691000	2693000	Ain't that amazing?
2693000	2696000	Thank you so much for that tip, Milk Katmas.
2696000	2700000	But yeah, I didn't do anything wrong this stream.
2700000	2708000	But if you didn't know, AC Snowballs is live right now doing a DJ session.
2708000	2715000	So if you're needing this to be a bit more, if you're needing a bit more hype for your stream,
2715000	2718000	definitely check her out.
2718000	2723000	M-A, Shabby, and Azura, I believe we're all going live as well.
2723000	2726000	This is the shortest stream for me.
2726000	2730000	We will be redirecting into Shabby Cotton Bomb.
2730000	2734000	Sounds like a piece of rubber stuck to the surface.
2734000	2738000	Heck yeah, I was a good girl this stream.
2738000	2740000	I did everything correct.
2740000	2742000	Yeah, it sounds like one of those squeeze stress toys.
2742000	2744000	Yeah, that's exactly what it is.
2750000	2752000	Yeah.
2753000	2758000	I just don't want to risk it, and also you only want to say the name, right?
2758000	2760000	I don't even know what I'm saying.
2760000	2762000	I forgot.
2762000	2764000	Wait, you're going already?
2764000	2768000	No, I'm going to do Gremlin ASMR.
2768000	2772000	I'm going to do ASMR like me.
2772000	2774000	Look, I even have this to put on your ears.
2774000	2776000	Are you ready?
2776000	2778000	Look, look, look, look.
2778000	2780000	I'm going to put this on your ears.
2780000	2782000	Ready?
2784000	2786000	Look.
2786000	2788000	You're almost home.
2792000	2796000	You can Gremlin ASMR.
2800000	2802000	Yeah.
2802000	2804000	This has a name.
2806000	2810000	I'm rubbing them all against your ears.
2810000	2814000	I put winter earmuffs on your ears.
2822000	2826000	Wow, then I did stream with absolutely no ears.
2826000	2830000	What do you mean by cats fighting at the start of the stream?
2830000	2834000	They're not going to leave a like, and then don't leave my sound.
2834000	2838000	Yeah, you're so fluffy.
2838000	2842000	Fluffy, fluffy, fluffy.
2842000	2844000	You're so fluffy.
2844000	2850000	First, I'm listening to ASMR.
2850000	2852000	I'm going to come back for more.
2852000	2854000	Glad I could take it.
2854000	2856000	You're in your ears.
2856000	2862000	It's nice to have a short stream to recover from your infinite stamina.
2862000	2864000	My voice is really broken,
2864000	2866000	but because I'm whispering, you can't tell it's broken.
2866000	2868000	Hippie.
2868000	2872000	Oh, some people like chucking ASMR.
2872000	2876000	I have lots of chucking water.
2880000	2884000	Have I been a good girl for you?
2892000	2894000	Wait, wait, wait.
2902000	2916000	Yeah, I forgot my tea.
2916000	2920000	I've got a cold cup of tea over here.
2920000	2924000	But I was having a lot of fun doing that ASMR.
2924000	2934000	And really, sorry, my throat's making rock noises.
2934000	2938000	Yeah, but this is just going to be an easier stream,
2938000	2946000	because I don't want to break my voice.
2946000	2950000	This is the closest I've ever been to me.
2950000	2954000	I'm usually so focused on trying to go under.
2954000	2960000	See, but I think because I didn't plan any of what I was saying,
2960000	2964000	because I was like natural, it made it easier to enjoy.
2964000	2970000	That's probably why.
2970000	2974000	Be a good girl and swallow what you...
2974000	2978000	Reflings, we're trying to leave this up.
2978000	2982000	Will you ever do a full hypno video?
2982000	2984000	Yeah, definitely.
2984000	2986000	I need to make sure I make it safe though.
2986000	2990000	I need to educate myself a bit more,
2990000	2992000	because I need it all to be safe.
2992000	2996000	Which is why I'm not doing any permanent effects on this stream,
2996000	3002000	because I may or may not have an interest in permanent effects,
3002000	3008000	but I already have an audio recorded that undoes any effects that I may do on you.
3008000	3012000	But I really like the permanent effects stuff.
3012000	3014000	I'm sorry, it's just what I'm interested in,
3014000	3016000	and I may want to break you a little bit, but just a little bit.
3016000	3018000	It's not going to be bad or anything.
3018000	3020000	Like it's just going to be a wee bit of breaking, okay?
3020000	3022000	Just a wee bit.
3022000	3026000	Not a big bit.
3026000	3030000	So yeah, I need to make sure I do it 100% safe.
3030000	3032000	Oh, bro.
3032000	3034000	Break me, mom.
3034000	3038000	To keep up the buns, I just have to say,
3038000	3042000	you and your eyes were astonishing.
3042000	3044000	Thank you.
3044000	3046000	I love it.
3046000	3048000	70% break.
3048000	3050000	Take or leave it.
3050000	3052000	And before we commit more crimes.
3052000	3054000	Effects like what?
3054000	3058000	Oh, so there's like different kinds of like hypno,
3058000	3066000	and so you can purposely make like trainer ones where like I train you,
3066000	3070000	like I literally path off your subconscious to react to me,
3070000	3072000	or to do something,
3072000	3076000	or react in a certain way,
3076000	3080000	and I need to make sure it's super safe,
3080000	3087000	and I need, if I do an audio that basically states that like I don't have an effect on you anymore,
3087000	3092000	it tells your subconscious through everything that you learned out of the window,
3092000	3096000	and then it's all safe.
3096000	3101000	Welcome to Stunny Cat's YouTube, where safety number one priority.
3101000	3104000	Thoughts already doomed.
3104000	3106000	Stunning her permanent effect.
3106000	3109000	It would be like you will only donate your ink to me.
3109000	3112000	Basically, kind of.
3112000	3114000	It's the plan.
3114000	3120000	I want to do like sessions that last two hours long.
3120000	3122000	I can't wait.
3122000	3128000	I know my voice is going to be fried, but yeah.
3128000	3131000	Will there be lullabies for the replay?
3131000	3138000	My voice is broken, but I know you are my sunshine.
3138000	3141000	You are my sunshine.
3141000	3144000	My only sunshine.
3144000	3149000	You make me happy when skies are gray.
3149000	3154000	You'll never know, dear, much I love you.
3154000	3159000	So please don't take my replay away.
3159000	3162000	Lullabies!
3162000	3165000	I don't know many other lullabies.
3165000	3167000	Um...
3167000	3171000	Freerejaka. Freerejaka.
3171000	3175000	Dormefu. Dormefu.
3175000	3179000	Would be cool if you had a button that made the camera zoom in on your eyes.
3179000	3185000	Oh, well, next stream, I'll have a tracker, so it follows my head around.
3185000	3190000	So you can't escape my eyes, but I wanted to go very easy.
3190000	3193000	Very easy on the first one.
3193000	3196000	Please don't take my sunshine away.
3196000	3200000	Dormefu. Dormefu.
3200000	3203000	There's that cradle one.
3203000	3205000	The cradle you will fall.
3205000	3209000	Rock, bye, baby, on the tree top.
3209000	3213000	When the wind blows, the cradle will rock.
3213000	3216000	I don't know the rest.
3216000	3218000	What were your inspirations for being?
3218000	3220000	I have no themed career.
3220000	3223000	I've always, always loved it.
3223000	3225000	I've always loved it.
3225000	3230000	But I have always known how deep the rabbit hole goes.
3230000	3233000	And I've touched on surface level.
3233000	3237000	But I was like, I want to go, I want to go rabbit hole.
3237000	3240000	Sorry, the wire is spilling on the desk.
3240000	3244000	I want to go all in, baby, all in.
3244000	3248000	So, will the table at the top be fixed?
3248000	3251000	No, if you tell me, I have to spell the word.
3251000	3253000	What's the word?
3253000	3255000	Be'er me.
3255000	3256000	Was it, was it?
3256000	3257000	Be'er me.
3257000	3258000	Be'er me.
3258000	3260000	I need.
3260000	3261000	Be'er me.
3261000	3262000	I need.
3262000	3263000	Okay, there you go.
3263000	3266000	Just like that, see, I can do it.
3266000	3268000	Okay, you even had to bring gremlin.
3268000	3269000	Gremlin.
3269000	3271000	No.
3271000	3273000	Gremlin.
3273000	3275000	Wow, look at that.
3275000	3277000	Super professional.
3277000	3279000	Sorry.
3279000	3281000	We're going down the heaven of the world.
3281000	3285000	Yeah, there's like so much to it that I just knew I couldn't do it.
3285000	3288000	Until, until it would stay.
3288000	3290000	And now it's time.
3292000	3294000	I'm going to be deppy.
3294000	3295000	I'm gremlin-ized.
3295000	3296000	Yeah.
3296000	3299000	Don't be expecting anything serious from me.
3302000	3304000	How did you like my head load?
3304000	3306000	Obnoxiously load my keyboard?
3306000	3307000	Oh yeah.
3307000	3310000	It's so good.
3310000	3318000	So I, for triggers, I like double finger-clicking.
3318000	3320000	I like finger-clicking.
3320000	3325000	For words or phrases, I want to do what you kindly.
3325000	3328000	I want to do mehabs.
3328000	3331000	Because I say mehabs all the time.
3331000	3335000	Mehabs, refling, you want to go deeper.
3336000	3342000	Which you kindly, refling, go deeper with me.
3342000	3345000	Like, oh, those are such good trigger words.
3346000	3348000	But yeah.
3349000	3352000	Is Johnny susceptible to hypnosis?
3352000	3353000	Yes.
3353000	3355000	My biggest enemy are mirrors.
3355000	3359000	Unfortunately, I can fall to my own hypnosis.
3359000	3362000	But it only lasts 24 hours.
3362000	3364000	It's fain, it's fain.
3366000	3368000	Would you kindly, would be hilarious?
3368000	3371000	Yes, we're literally doing it off of BioShock.
3371000	3376000	Look, look, um, we're gamers out here, okay?
3376000	3378000	We're gamers.
3378000	3380000	We're here for the memes as well.
3380000	3388000	But it doesn't mean we can't incorporate our favourite games into our other activities.
3389000	3392000	Johnny drilling on the floor in front of a mirror.
3392000	3397000	Stop, I want to order so much artwork about all these different plots.
3397000	3401000	And like, oh no, the reflings have found me.
3402000	3405000	Just going to beat you into a mirror.
3408000	3410000	We didn't, oh no.
3410000	3412000	But we are doing hypnosis in general.
3412000	3420000	But I've already done the segment because I need to be gremlin gamer mode right now.
3420000	3423000	Because it's me, I can't help it.
3423000	3425000	I'm just a freaking meme lord.
3425000	3427000	It's hard to be serious, okay?
3429000	3436000	Yeah, enjoy the memes while enjoying our, you didn't finish that sentence.
3436000	3438000	Why are you not finishing it?
3438000	3440000	We're not here gaming.
3440000	3445000	We're only big gamers here, yeah, tons of games.
3445000	3459000	Remember that a man, a man bleeds a slave obeys and reflings feel prey for the orders coming from the queue.
3459000	3463000	Yeah, put on a suit for your serious stream.
3463000	3466000	Oh, a man chooses, oops, sorry.
3466000	3471000	A man chooses a refling obeys.
3471000	3473000	Oh wait, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.
3473000	3475000	Wait, pause, pause, pause the tunes.
3477000	3479000	Okay, hold on, pause the tunes, pause the tunes.
3480000	3483000	Oh hi, I see in berries, hold on, we're caught in bio shock.
3487000	3494000	A man chooses a refling obeys.
3497000	3499000	Oh wait, why is my freaking calibration?
3499000	3501000	I was looking at the pollin.
3502000	3506000	Hi, A.C. in snowberries, I promise I'm not trying to hypnotize you.
3506000	3508000	We're in Kremlin hours, okay?
3508000	3510000	Hi, A.C. girl, I was your rave.
3510000	3512000	I hope your voice is okay.
3512000	3515000	I was watching you in the bath again.
3516000	3521000	I take a bath every morning to try and steam my throat before stream.
3521000	3528000	A.C. is live, so I was watching her and she dressed up as a princess the way Mercy Drew are.
3528000	3531000	If you guys didn't see Mercy Drew, I'll turn it off.
3531000	3533000	It was amazing.
3535000	3543000	Maybe at the end of stream, I will do, I will do maybe serious mode, okay?
3543000	3548000	I'm actually gonna make sure I'm reading into Shibi.
3548000	3552000	Sorry, I'm reflecting to the screen right now.
3553000	3558000	But yeah, let's just hold on.
3558000	3561000	Customization, redirect.
3561000	3563000	We partied now.
3563000	3566000	All the snowberries are tired.
3566000	3568000	Little babies.
3568000	3570000	Shibi's playing call of the lamb.
3570000	3574000	Oh my god, I think me and Shibi might be doing multiplayer call of the lamb.
3575000	3579000	Is Shibi first and then Azura and then Mercy?
3582000	3585000	Who's coming online first, Azura or Mercy?
3585000	3587000	Eh, Azura or Shibi?
3588000	3590000	She had a big mercy.
3590000	3592000	Uchi-san party?
3592000	3595000	Ah, it's tall, that's terrible.
3595000	3600000	Did the Uchi-sans have a good time or are you all ready for a nap after that?
3600000	3602000	Hold on, I'll just check.
3602000	3604000	Who comes online first?
3604000	3608000	Is Azura or is it Azura or Azura?
3608000	3610000	Wait, where is Azura?
3610000	3611000	I just don't know.
3611000	3613000	I'm sure the girl's on my screen.
3614000	3621000	But yeah, I first Azura live and have a long Azura's live.
3621000	3624000	Oh, oh wait, in 5, 10?
3624000	3627000	Okay, no, it's definitely Shibi that comes up next.
3627000	3629000	Sorry.
3629000	3631000	It was amazing.
3631000	3634000	Oh, Uchi-sans, time to pay you to sleep.
3634000	3637000	Come here, old man.
3637000	3639000	You're too faint.
3641000	3645000	You barged so hard with Azura
3645000	3650000	and she showed you how much energy she has, yeah?
3652000	3656000	Oh, and you've used up all your energy, Uchi-san.
3656000	3660000	Time to pay you to sleep by a Kremlin.
3663000	3665000	I'm ready to chill for a moment.
3665000	3667000	Yeah.
3667000	3672000	I made a little induction at the end of the stream,
3672000	3674000	but right now we're a Kremlin mode, okay?
3674000	3676000	I can't be serious.
3676000	3679000	I laughed, I cried, I...
3680000	3682000	What?
3682000	3684000	Am I supposed to even pronounce that?
3684000	3687000	Even in our ASMR streams, you speak fast.
3687000	3690000	Oh yeah, you think that's speaking fast?
3695000	3697000	Can you be serious?
3697000	3699000	Not for long.
3699000	3701000	Kremlin mode activated, yeah.
3703000	3706000	We're real ASMRists out here.
3707000	3711000	I'm speaking in an enchanted main craft table.
3714000	3719000	It's pronounced U-O-U-O.
3724000	3726000	Surely you can be serious.
3726000	3728000	But what was that?
3728000	3732000	It's called Ace Globes.
3732000	3737000	Because Ace finished her stream, I'm using the Ace Globes.
3738000	3743000	I fell farther in love with my cute and funny Uchi-san loving.
3743000	3745000	Oshii.
3745000	3750000	And this is why we don't have chat on screen during ASMR streams.
3751000	3753000	What is that?
3753000	3755000	It's the unknown.
3756000	3760000	A.C. should introduce you to Igor.
3760000	3762000	Who's Igor?
3764000	3767000	Ace Globes are so nice, yeah.
3768000	3772000	Mercy had some Ace Globes in her ASMR.
3772000	3775000	And Emi Gopska must on Ace Globes.
3775000	3780000	I don't know if she said the story yet, so I'll let her tell the story.
3781000	3783000	I feel better already.
3786000	3789000	You and Igor will get along well.
3790000	3793000	I feel better already, yeah.
3795000	3799000	There's no permanent influence on this stream, what does that mean?
3799000	3810000	So some hypnosis ASMRists like to mark you and leave you with a present.
3810000	3814000	And I'm not doing that because we are slowly...
3815000	3817000	...working our way.
3818000	3824000	You have to take things slow and take your time.
3825000	3830000	And I'm gonna take my time with you briefly.
3831000	3835000	And get you all tired.
3838000	3841000	Oh, it's a reference to the polar bear game.
3841000	3848000	Would you ever use water next to a $2,000 microphone?
3849000	3852000	I don't know, this is the best water you're gonna get.
3854000	3858000	Permanent hypnosis is just a gift that keeps on giving.
3859000	3861000	Slow indoctrination.
3862000	3864000	Would you kindly rethink?
3865000	3867000	Let me do what I want to you.
3872000	3878000	It's time to come down from the party, Snowberry.
3884000	3886000	You're under the sea.
3886000	3888000	No need hypnosis for that.
3890000	3891000	Always.
3891000	3895000	Today was already a chill day for me, so this stream was really fun.
3895000	3896000	I'm glad.
3896000	3900000	I'll try to do ASMR streams every week.
3901000	3903000	Yeah, my back hurts.
3903000	3905000	Okay, true OG suns for it.
3907000	3911000	But yes, I will do ASMR every week.
3912000	3915000	Some more intense than the other.
3915000	3918000	Some plots as well.
3918000	3922000	Like, feel probably plots making life.
3923000	3928000	And I do, like, when I get you guys to talk and give me suggestions,
3928000	3933000	I do apologize if you typed for me to say something.
3933000	3936000	I had to make sure it fitted with the theme,
3936000	3940000	which is why I brought you up so I can start being a gremlin again,
3940000	3943000	because I didn't want you to be down and be gremlin mode.
3944000	3947000	Big Willy Wallace is morally wet.
3948000	3951000	My back's gone after that DJ stream.
3952000	3954000	That's so good.
3954000	3956000	I break from my own mind every week.
3956000	3957000	Yeah.
3957000	3959000	Oh yeah, some good plots.
3959000	3960000	Oh yeah.
3960000	3964000	Some real deep thought-provoking plots.
3966000	3969000	Okay, let me see if this is freaking tracking.
3969000	3972000	I think, because I'm not sure.
3973000	3974000	Okay.
3977000	3979000	Okay, I think this better.
3980000	3983000	My mouse tracking just kind of stops working after all.
3983000	3987000	It's like, I think it gets confused with the ASMR mic.
3987000	3990000	You like the background things.
3990000	3992000	I made it myself.
3993000	3994000	I did it.
3995000	3998000	I'm not like it in Adobe After Effects.
4000000	4002000	Bass streamer and vealer.
4004000	4008000	All my girls were bass streamer and vealer.
4009000	4011000	They're all the best.
4012000	4013000	Yeah.
4013000	4014000	No.
4014000	4015000	You do you.
4015000	4016000	Strongly, we still love you.
4016000	4017000	Yeah.
4019000	4021000	That background is amazing.
4021000	4022000	Yes.
4022000	4025000	I can also go faster or slower,
4025000	4028000	but I'll do that another time.
4029000	4032000	But just so that I can really make it intense, okay?
4033000	4037000	Like, I, this, this sound you hear,
4037000	4042000	this, I can also make it faster and more intense.
4042000	4045000	So please don't think I haven't thought this through.
4046000	4047000	Wait, wait, wait.
4049000	4051000	It's over for you.
4052000	4053000	Don't resist.
4054000	4056000	There's no point in resisting.
4057000	4058000	Okay, love, rethink.
4059000	4063000	You are main.
4064000	4066000	Just give me some time.
4067000	4068000	Just let me kick.
4070000	4071000	Me kick.
4072000	4073000	Terrible.
4074000	4075000	And then what?
4076000	4079000	Oh no, all my money's going into your pocket.
4081000	4083000	That's terrible, replay.
4085000	4086000	Yeah.
4089000	4091000	That sin doesn't have any side effects.
4091000	4094000	No, no, none of them have secret.
4094000	4096000	I have no secret agenda.
4096000	4099000	Thank you, window for cracking during the ASMR stream.
4099000	4103000	That window cracked like three times during my segments.
4103000	4105000	I was like, really, you're getting rude.
4106000	4108000	I wasn't sure if I liked the background noise,
4108000	4110000	but I really like it all.
4110000	4112000	If you don't like that noise, don't worry,
4112000	4114000	I'll train you to like it.
4116000	4118000	Just stop resisting.
4119000	4121000	Your efforts are futile.
4121000	4123000	You will not win against me.
4123000	4125000	I have unending stamina.
4125000	4127000	Are my streams not proof enough?
4129000	4130000	Thank you for the tip.
4131000	4133000	Irwin Blair, thank you for the tip.
4133000	4136000	Yes, must give all money to feel it.
4137000	4139000	Thank you for the tip, Irwin.
4140000	4142000	Support my babies.
4143000	4146000	Support my babies so they can move out.
4146000	4149000	And I can buy them a better internet connection.
4150000	4153000	Thank you so much for the tip, though.
4153000	4155000	I appreciate it greatly.
4158000	4160000	I need some hydration.
4160000	4162000	You can hear some ASMR gulps.
4169000	4171000	All gone.
4172000	4174000	None left.
4174000	4176000	Thank you.
4176000	4178000	Wow.
4178000	4180000	Strani, does the Cuttlefish's rule perfect?
4180000	4182000	Only at one speed.
4182000	4184000	Yes, only one speed.
4185000	4188000	I didn't want people to think I'm doing a rave.
4192000	4194000	I'll fight Mummy's unending stamina
4194000	4195000	with my own.
4195000	4197000	Let's see how it comes out on top.
4198000	4200000	Me.
4204000	4206000	Oh, the cuttlefish is going to get...
4208000	4210000	This cuttlefish is going to get...
4212000	4214000	Hey yo, I can't read that out.
4216000	4218000	Oh gosh, oh my money's going to skew, gosh.
4220000	4223000	For those of you who did drain in a little late,
4223000	4225000	my YouTube...
4225000	4227000	I'm going to burp, sorry.
4230000	4233000	My YouTube channel's been subbed for monetization.
4235000	4238000	I'm actually getting a manicure and a pedicure today
4239000	4242000	in preparation for my monetization stream.
4243000	4245000	So there's your hint.
4246000	4248000	Hopefully it comes through quickly.
4249000	4251000	And I'm very excited.
4251000	4253000	Zero I didn't know how to...
4253000	4255000	Yeah, I did it into my...
4255000	4257000	I'm wearing a hoodie.
4257000	4259000	I'm wearing a hoodie.
4259000	4262000	But yeah, I'm getting my first ever manicure and pedicure.
4263000	4265000	I have no idea what...
4265000	4268000	I think they like, massage your legs as well.
4269000	4272000	So I'm going to like, get nice and smooth
4272000	4274000	and like, shave my legs.
4275000	4277000	Just to make sure they don't have to touch my like,
4277000	4279000	stubbly legs.
4281000	4283000	But yeah, I will be interesting.
4283000	4286000	Maybe I should like, live tweet my experience
4287000	4289000	and being like, oh the person's doing this now,
4289000	4291000	they're doing this to my foot.
4291000	4294000	Because I've never had like, a pedicure
4294000	4296000	is when it's your feet.
4296000	4299000	Because pediatry is feet care.
4299000	4301000	And then manicure, man,
4301000	4303000	manage the balls or your hands.
4304000	4306000	And while the rest of the feet allergen
4306000	4308000	begin monetization too,
4308000	4312000	yes, they are being submitted today.
4312000	4316000	I believe we are waiting for the YouTube stats to update.
4317000	4319000	Because they're taking their sweet time.
4319000	4322000	It took a week for the statistics to update.
4323000	4326000	And then everyone is doing their monetization,
4326000	4328000	celebration, streams.
4328000	4330000	And ooh,
4332000	4333000	everyone's eating good.
4333000	4335000	That's all I'm going to say.
4335000	4338000	It may as well be,
4338000	4342000	oh no, it may as well be Thanksgiving.
4350000	4353000	What the fuck?
4355000	4356000	My tech.
4358000	4359000	What?
4360000	4362000	What the fuck?
4362000	4363000	My phone?
4367000	4368000	My phone?
4368000	4369000	My tech talk?
4370000	4372000	I was so scared.
4372000	4374000	Oh my god.
4375000	4377000	I was so scared.
4378000	4379000	My phone just,
4379000	4382000	my tech talk just opened up on its own.
4383000	4384000	Bruh,
4384000	4386000	China's listening in.
4386000	4387000	What the fuck?
4387000	4388000	I,
4388000	4390000	what the fuck?
4390000	4394000	My phone just opened up on its own
4394000	4398000	to play a freaking advertisement to me.
4399000	4401000	What was that?
4401000	4404000	I thought someone was outside in the garden.
4404000	4406000	I was like, oh my god, there's someone outside my house.
4406000	4408000	I need to end stream right now.
4408000	4410000	That was scary.
4410000	4412000	Oh my god.
4415000	4418000	I was so scared there.
4418000	4419000	I was like, what?
4419000	4421000	China, I'll prove to you, sir.
4421000	4424000	My Chinese grade, it just went up by 100k.
4424000	4426000	That was horrifying.
4427000	4428000	I thought that was,
4428000	4429000	I was freaking out.
4429000	4430000	I was like, what?
4430000	4431000	What?
4431000	4433000	I should be the only thing making noise.
4433000	4435000	What was that?
4436000	4437000	What?
4437000	4439000	My heart rate is exhilarated.
4439000	4441000	Literally my social credit just went up.
4442000	4444000	What on earth?
4446000	4447000	I think that was an ad,
4447000	4449000	because I opened tech talk.
4449000	4451000	And then,
4451000	4454000	like it loaded a video or something.
4458000	4460000	We can hire her, she said again.
4460000	4462000	I'm not doing hypnosis.
4462000	4463000	I'm gremlin mode.
4463000	4465000	Read the top.
4465000	4467000	That's what you get for having TikTok.
4467000	4469000	That's what I get for brain run.
4470000	4471000	That was scary.
4471000	4472000	Jeez.
4474000	4476000	Okay, what was I saying before that?
4476000	4478000	Oh, monetization.
4478000	4482000	Wait, is monetization a trigger word
4482000	4484000	for the TikTok spice?
4486000	4488000	They want the money too.
4489000	4491000	What is it?
4492000	4494000	Do you want heart beat ASMR?
4494000	4496000	I don't think I have
4497000	4499000	a ceiling on it.
4499000	4501000	A member ceiling.
4501000	4503000	The numbers may send, honestly.
4503000	4505000	Because I was talking about monetization
4505000	4507000	and then the hand.
4509000	4511000	TikTok loves monetization.
4511000	4513000	I said, yeah, give me some of that.
4513000	4514000	Jeez.
4516000	4517000	Okay.
4518000	4521000	Let's, let's drag you back into ASMR.
4521000	4522000	That freaked me out.
4522000	4524000	That was scary, because I was like,
4524000	4526000	hello, hello, who's there?
4526000	4528000	Refuel yourself.
4528000	4530000	Refueling is like you.
4532000	4533000	Okay.
4534000	4536000	Just save money.
4539000	4541000	I accidentally woke up.
4541000	4542000	What happened?
4542000	4544000	My freaking phone started playing ads.
4544000	4547000	Even though I didn't touch my phone at all.
4547000	4549000	I don't think I'm, I'm not bringing.
4549000	4550000	I don't like that.
4550000	4551000	That was scary.
4553000	4555000	We're in your walls.
4555000	4556000	Oh my gosh.
4556000	4559000	Okay, let's see if we can do heart beat ASMR.
4559000	4562000	I need to put, I need to put you over my hoodie.
4562000	4563000	Okay.
4563000	4564000	But maybe a little loud.
4564000	4566000	But this is my heart.
4566000	4568000	I'll do, I'll do this side, because it's easier.
4569000	4570000	You have one.
4570000	4571000	Thank you.
4571000	4572000	Okay.
4577000	4578000	Can you hear it?
4582000	4583000	Can you hear my heart at all?
4595000	4596000	Yeah.
4602000	4604000	That's my heart beat.
4604000	4606000	Is it fast or slow?
4606000	4608000	It might be fast, because I'm talking.
4610000	4613000	That's why at the doctor's office,
4613000	4618000	they tell you not to talk when you take the pressure cuff on your arm.
4632000	4636000	Do you want to see how fast my heart can go?
4638000	4640000	We're going to mess around, okay?
4640000	4642000	I'm going to turn the volume down.
4661000	4662000	Okay.
4691000	4701000	And that's just my heart.
4703000	4705000	I'm hearing mummies.
4705000	4707000	You hear my stomach sound?
4707000	4708000	Stop.
4717000	4719000	That's how fast my heart can really go.
4722000	4727000	Can I ruin a surprise for you guys?
4727000	4731000	Because it's my content, I'm allowed to ruin the surprise, okay?
4734000	4737000	The stomach was louder than the heart now.
4739000	4745000	I'm going to do an ASMR video, like a role play,
4745000	4750000	where you are pregnant and you're in my tummy
4750000	4753000	and I'm talking to you about how proud I am
4753000	4758000	and how excited I am for everything you're going to achieve in your life.
4758000	4762000	And I can't wait for you to experience the world,
4762000	4766000	and it's going to have my actual heartbeat and stomach sounds in it.
4766000	4771000	And I'm going to tell you all that you deserve,
4771000	4774000	all the good things in life that happen.
4774000	4777000	And I'm going to be your cheerleader.
4779000	4783000	And yeah, I need to get the artwork commissioned though,
4783000	4787000	because I need to draw me pregnant with you in my tummy.
4787000	4791000	And I'll be wearing like a mummy outfit and everything.
4792000	4801000	So yeah, and I'm going to tell you how excited I am for you to get to know you
4801000	4804000	and I get to see what your personality is like
4804000	4807000	and you're going to be perfect in every way,
4807000	4812000	because there's no way that my little reef link can do any wrong.
4816000	4820000	That's strangely, yeah, and you're going to hear my tummy sounds on my heartbeat
4820000	4824000	and my voice is going to be muffled, it's going to be like this, okay?
4824000	4828000	This is what my voice is going to sound like, wow.
4829000	4832000	And I'm so proud of you.
4832000	4834000	Now my voice is so broken.
4834000	4838000	I'm sorry I broke my voice, so this doesn't sound very pleasant.
4841000	4844000	But I'm so proud of you.
4844000	4847000	And I can't wait to meet you.
4848000	4852000	And I can't wait to watch you grow up
4852000	4855000	and do all the things you love
4855000	4859000	and see what hope is you fall in love with.
4860000	4863000	And you're going to be so smart like your mummy.
4871000	4873000	Your broken voice sounds like sadness.
4873000	4876000	Oh no, no, I'm not sad.
4876000	4879000	I'm sad that I didn't have my cup of tea,
4879000	4884000	but I had a lot of fun getting you very deep into the moment.
4884000	4886000	Who's the daddy?
4886000	4889000	You, again, rifling.
4892000	4895000	Don't you not know the failure or the lore?
4895000	4900000	The reason why I have five daughters is all because of the riflings.
4902000	4907000	See, in order to make sure that no one rifling can claim that they're the daddy,
4907000	4912000	all of us got together, turned the lights out and just went for it,
4912000	4914000	okay, we just went for it.
4914000	4917000	That's why we have five daughters.
4935000	4937000	We should do that again sometime.
4937000	4940000	Yeah, you want to find out what book it is?
4940000	4942000	We're both hired out.
4942000	4947000	We've actually been confirmed that we are showing up to a convention,
4947000	4949000	but it's in 2025.
4951000	4954000	But I think it's in California.
4962000	4965000	I'm all the riflings on the daddy.
4966000	4969000	But yeah, very excited.
4969000	4972000	I don't know, it would be nice if we could all meet up at a convention,
4972000	4974000	but I don't know how the girls feel about her,
4974000	4979000	and I have absolutely horrific travelling say,
4979000	4982000	so I'm going to be so high.
4983000	4986000	I'm going to be high on medication.
4988000	4991000	I'm paying for that backstage, Max.
4992000	4996000	Honestly, I'm the father.
4996000	4999000	Oh, I'm the father, does a backflip.
5000000	5002000	Getting the VIP treatment.
5002000	5004000	Oh yeah.
5004000	5006000	I wish I could go to the con.
5006000	5009000	I don't know if I can go to the con.
5009000	5012000	So please do not book any conventions,
5012000	5014000	like for this whole purpose, in case I show up.
5014000	5016000	That's not how it works.
5017000	5022000	Mummies do weaknesses, travel and marriage.
5022000	5025000	I mean, I'll tell it in another stream,
5025000	5031000	but yeah, it's a very unfun story,
5031000	5034000	surrounding the toilet.
5037000	5041000	My backyard would love to go next.
5041000	5044000	That would be really cute, yeah.
5046000	5051000	I understood booking all conventions on the slim chance that you show up.
5055000	5057000	Oh my gosh, but then,
5057000	5061000	stick an entire brief worth of people in a tumble dryer,
5061000	5064000	and you basically get all the feel.
5066000	5069000	If we basically ummed you with five dollars,
5069000	5072000	shall we do it again with another five?
5072000	5073000	No.
5073000	5075000	With another six.
5077000	5079000	Come on, mommy needs to cook.
5082000	5085000	Like 41 hours away from California.
5085000	5087000	I think it's in California, I don't know,
5087000	5089000	I actually know where it is.
5093000	5095000	Six, yeah.
5095000	5097000	Every gen and veiler,
5097000	5100000	in theory, has six girls,
5100000	5107000	and there should be one design of each that you gravitate towards.
5111000	5115000	That's right, I may not be the smartest,
5115000	5118000	but I know what to do someday,
5118000	5121000	but I like being dumb.
5121000	5124000	I like reeflings doing all the thinking for me.
5126000	5129000	What if you gravitate towards all the designs?
5130000	5133000	I don't know, I feel like one has to speak to you.
5137000	5139000	So you are the oven.
5139000	5141000	I'm just an oven.
5141000	5143000	I just need you to fill it.
5143000	5145000	Let's be dumb together.
5151000	5154000	You're great except for the naming part, exactly.
5155000	5158000	What do you mean straw knee 365?
5158000	5162000	I wonder if I called myself straw knee 365
5162000	5166000	because my secret goal was to stream every single day for a year.
5166000	5170000	But, yeah, we're already going to blow that out of the water
5170000	5172000	unless I'm gravely ill.
5174000	5177000	Smooth out the brain wrinkles.
5177000	5179000	This is something I could get by it.
5179000	5183000	What if I'm gravitated towards the accent instead?
5184000	5186000	Then how's that going, mate?
5186000	5188000	I like this accent.
5188000	5190000	That's what tickles your pickle.
5190000	5192000	Oh, then he might need me.
5192000	5195000	I'll tickle that pickle any day I will.
5198000	5200000	What do you mean?
5201000	5203000	You will always be my Archie.
5203000	5205000	Oh, thank you.
5208000	5210000	See, I'm here because fish,
5210000	5213000	who doesn't like fish, also embrace of Xbox,
5213000	5215000	game collection.
5215000	5216000	What's that?
5216000	5217000	Yeah, he's been Xbox kid.
5217000	5218000	Oh, so cool.
5218000	5221000	I used to be one of those kids in the YouTube comments
5221000	5222000	that were like,
5222000	5225000	Xbox is so much cooler than PlayStation.
5225000	5229000	Yeah, and PlayStation sucks, yeah.
5231000	5233000	That accent is good.
5233000	5234000	It's above.
5234000	5236000	That accent's funny.
5236000	5238000	It can be sexy when I put it on.
5239000	5244000	I feel like if I want to do a voice that commands you,
5244000	5247000	I need to go deeper.
5250000	5253000	I'm a console warfare, aren't ya?
5253000	5255000	See, I was bursted,
5255000	5258000	and had to be asked from a car boot sale for a 5-hour.
5258000	5260000	PlayStation died.
5261000	5264000	Yeah, PlayStation drills.
5265000	5268000	Strangely, I was on the right team for a day one.
5269000	5273000	Not beaten, they'd come get me or she get location.
5276000	5280000	The Scottish accent is sexy.
5280000	5282000	I didn't know how.
5283000	5286000	Like my actual accent when I'm monthly.
5286000	5288000	I'm like, oh, who's it going lads?
5288000	5291000	I'm, yep, this is so as I'm laced.
5294000	5297000	We better have some backpipes at the convention.
5297000	5299000	No, that's awful.
5299000	5302000	I double in 360, but I was a Nintendo kid.
5302000	5305000	Nintendo was so expensive.
5305000	5307000	My dad got me a Nintendo TS,
5307000	5312000	but he was always happier to let me buy like secondhand
5312000	5315000	Xbox 360 games over Nintendo's secondhand
5315000	5317000	because it was so expensive.
5317000	5320000	We used to have this game shop in the UK
5320000	5323000	called GameStop or Game.
5323000	5326000	I think they both went past, I can't remember.
5326000	5328000	And basically,
5332000	5334000	wait, what?
5334000	5337000	They went past, but they used to sell secondhand games
5337000	5339000	and that's how I got all my games.
5339000	5341000	They used to do what was called trade-ins
5341000	5344000	and I would have to trade-in my games to get new ones.
5347000	5349000	I think Game Stations passed now.
5349000	5352000	Yeah, wasn't it called EB games?
5354000	5357000	Now in the UK, not that I know of,
5357000	5360000	you aren't wrong though about Nintendo being far too expensive.
5360000	5362000	Yes.
5362000	5365000	And they just shut down the eNintendo store.
5369000	5372000	I think GameStop is still a thing.
5372000	5375000	Did you ever go to CEX?
5376000	5378000	I don't think so.
5379000	5382000	I think most game stores did a version of a trade-in model.
5382000	5385000	Yeah, that's how I got my games.
5386000	5388000	It's been Game Stations.
5388000	5391000	Oh, maybe it's Game Stations that at GameStop.
5393000	5395000	It might be Game Stations.
5395000	5398000	Just remember I was a weebap.
5398000	5400000	I just looked at the covers of the games and went,
5400000	5402000	Dad, I want that one.
5402000	5404000	EB is...
5404000	5407000	Wait, what? EB games was in the UK.
5408000	5410000	Oh, yeah, no.
5411000	5414000	If it went bust in 2002,
5414000	5417000	I never experienced EB games.
5420000	5422000	I was Xbox for a long time then Switch
5422000	5425000	because the Japanese make some fire games.
5428000	5430000	Game is still a thing in the UK.
5430000	5433000	GameStop is still a thing in the US.
5433000	5436000	I'll go EB games.
5436000	5439000	We're just EB sleepy gamers.
5441000	5444000	I miss choosing games by the cover now I Google them.
5444000	5446000	Things endlessly.
5447000	5451000	If you're ever one in a new game to completely time sync
5451000	5454000	and you play PC for mods,
5454000	5457000	I recommend the painting of Isaac
5457000	5459000	and I'm not recommending it
5459000	5463000	just so you guys can all princess carry me through the game.
5463000	5465000	It's a very big game.
5465000	5468000	Big and gay, big and gay.
5473000	5476000	Yeah, in the UK, this game is now a game station.
5476000	5477000	Go buy a buy-up.
5477000	5479000	Oh, go, go, go.
5479000	5482000	EB games was absorbed by GameStop.
5482000	5484000	Oh my god, we're getting the lore.
5484000	5487000	We're getting the capitalism lore.
5487000	5490000	Ooh, yeah, painting of Isaac.
5490000	5491000	Yeah.
5491000	5493000	The painting of Isaac doesn't work anymore
5493000	5495000	in your PC, huh?
5498000	5501000	Yeah, I had an Xbox, just an Xbox.
5501000	5504000	Oh, the Xbox original.
5508000	5510000	I wanted to get my 360,
5510000	5512000	but I think it's messed up.
5512000	5516000	It's the latest console I own by a country male.
5518000	5521000	Here's a war hands down based story.
5522000	5525000	I'm sure I've just misread that,
5525000	5528000	but you actually made cameo.
5528000	5530000	Yeah, it's like a fantasy game.
5530000	5533000	It's really nice.
5533000	5536000	If you're talking about Xbox exclusives,
5536000	5538000	if you're talking about overall,
5538000	5540000	yeah, Assassin's Creed Brotherhood,
5540000	5541000	yeah, sorry, you've just miss,
5541000	5543000	you've just misspelled Assassin's Creed.
5543000	5547000	It's fine, you spell it as, as in, creed.
5547000	5549000	Yeah, no, it's fine, you've just misspelled.
5549000	5551000	Don't worry about it.
5551000	5553000	I can read through what you're missing.
5557000	5559000	Any fellow guitar hero enjoyers,
5559000	5561000	tilly, tilly, tilly.
5563000	5565000	I wish Army of Two was multiplayer,
5565000	5568000	but no, I don't think.
5568000	5571000	I would love to do Army of Two.
5572000	5574000	Oh, did you ever have a Game Boy?
5574000	5578000	I did, and I had like three Game Boy games.
5580000	5586000	My dad, so if my dad bought the console,
5586000	5589000	he would let me play it, basically,
5589000	5591000	and he bought a Game Boy,
5591000	5594000	and he didn't like it, so he gave it to me.
5597000	5601000	And I played Pokemon Ribby.
5601000	5606000	I played Legend of Zelda Minish Cap,
5607000	5612000	and one more game that I,
5612000	5615000	I'm sure there's one more game I probably played.
5615000	5617000	I forgot.
5617000	5620000	The Minish Cap is my only Zelda game.
5620000	5623000	Oh, my voice is breaking.
5623000	5625000	Legend of Zelda.
5625000	5628000	Mama Minish Cap.
5628000	5630000	Oh, sorry.
5630000	5633000	Oh, no, wait, no, sorry, tapping ASMR.
5633000	5636000	Little, little tappies.
5636000	5638000	Doesn't actually sound that nice.
5641000	5643000	I don't know what 33 Immortals is.
5643000	5645000	I haven't heard about it, have we?
5645000	5647000	What's your favorite Pokemon?
5647000	5649000	And why is it Shantler?
5649000	5651000	I actually didn't mean Lightwick.
5651000	5653000	Lightwick is so cute,
5653000	5655000	but see, Pokemon have this thing
5655000	5658000	where they make a really cute, adorable, creepy Pokemon,
5658000	5661000	and then its evolution is Oakland.
5662000	5665000	I didn't want ugly, ugly evolutions.
5665000	5667000	Lightwick is adorable.
5667000	5669000	It's an MMO.
5669000	5672000	We're knee-deep in RuneScape right now.
5672000	5676000	I took the console with me everywhere.
5676000	5678000	It'd be the crap out of the paints worn out,
5678000	5680000	but it still works.
5680000	5683000	All old-school games, I don't see.
5683000	5685000	Literally think of, what is it?
5685000	5687000	Joystick Drift?
5687000	5689000	No, that's not a gender name.
5689000	5691000	It's a Joy-Con Drift.
5691000	5694000	Oh, that's a Joy-Con Drift on Nintendo Switch.
5694000	5697000	But, like, Game Boy advances that were made
5697000	5699000	how many years back still work.
5699000	5703000	I'm catching up on old-school RuneScape vision now.
5706000	5710000	Did you all know there was a Pokemon card game on Game Boy?
5710000	5712000	Nope.
5712000	5714000	It's in the up-gaming.
5714000	5717000	Sorry, my voice is cracking.
5717000	5719000	Hello, I've got 25 minutes,
5719000	5721000	and then I'm required for an official vocal rest,
5721000	5723000	and we are reading into Shibi playing.
5723000	5727000	If you didn't know, Cult of the Lamb is a 10 out of 10 game.
5727000	5729000	I rate it very highly.
5734000	5736000	I had a Game Boy card game.
5736000	5738000	It was so fun.
5738000	5741000	Courtney was all, uh, it was Courtney.
5741000	5744000	The Game Boy card game was actually really good.
5744000	5746000	Sorry, can't go back to sleep.
5746000	5748000	May as well cook something.
5748000	5750000	Oh, very good.
5750000	5752000	And Jack and Kenabiana.
5752000	5754000	Huh?
5754000	5756000	Ah, yo.
5756000	5759000	Cult of the Lamb isn't your first update.
5759000	5761000	Cult of the Lamb's multiplayer,
5761000	5764000	so I'm gonna force Shibi to play it with me.
5767000	5770000	I still have my Pokemon card game on Game Boy.
5770000	5773000	Yeah, gonna go to work, see you next stream.
5773000	5775000	Yeah, I'm ending.
5775000	5779000	We're gonna redirect into Shibi in 20 minutes, okay?
5783000	5787000	You should play with us as cultists, then starting.
5787000	5790000	I don't know how the multiplayer works,
5790000	5792000	but we'll see.
5792000	5794000	Cult of the Lamb is Twitch integration.
5794000	5799000	I don't know if YouTube wants to do that kind of in-game integration or not.
5803000	5805000	Damn, it feels like the stream just started.
5805000	5808000	I mean, in terms of insurance, yeah.
5808000	5810000	Have you ever played War Thunder?
5810000	5812000	Yeah, I saw it.
5812000	5814000	It's local co-op. I could've sworn.
5814000	5817000	As all they said, I had multiplayer on my co-crazy.
5818000	5821000	What are you doing after stream?
5821000	5824000	I'm gonna make a cup of tea to soothe my throat,
5824000	5827000	and then I'm going to
5827000	5830000	message clippers
5830000	5833000	to go and check any clips that the girls might have had.
5833000	5837000	And then I'm gonna get a manicure and a pedicure.
5837000	5839000	I can't believe I'm saying that, but yes,
5839000	5842000	I'm going to get a manicure and a pedicure.
5842000	5845000	And then I'm going to edit some ASMRs
5845000	5848000	in preparation of getting monetized,
5848000	5851000	so I can upload those 1k special videos,
5851000	5854000	and I will probably write the script
5854000	5858000	for the pregnant with you ASMR
5858000	5860000	that I want to make,
5860000	5863000	and I'll most likely contact an artist as well
5863000	5865000	about it.
5867000	5869000	But yeah.
5869000	5872000	Quite a few things I need to catch up on,
5872000	5874000	especially with the insurance streams.
5874000	5878000	I'll probably be listening to Shibi in the background
5878000	5880000	as she plays.
5880000	5882000	So whoever said War Thunder,
5882000	5885000	you only play that game if you hate yourself.
5885000	5888000	But yes, I have a big day, big day.
5888000	5892000	I don't know if I should show a picture of my feet
5892000	5894000	and hands afterwards,
5894000	5897000	because some people don't like streamers
5897000	5900000	that do hand cam or whatever.
5900000	5902000	I'm very sorry if, you know,
5902000	5904000	get filler, get filler, get filler,
5904000	5906000	but yeah.
5907000	5910000	Literally tomorrow you get to see my hands.
5910000	5914000	Wah, whilst I eat the American candy.
5914000	5916000	Wah!
5916000	5921000	I get to try A&W visages
5921000	5923000	as like a cream and soda I said,
5923000	5926000	but I don't normally drink cream and soda.
5928000	5929000	And what other?
5929000	5932000	I think there is Twizzlers.
5932000	5934000	There is like Spacey Hall,
5934000	5936000	Cheetos or something,
5936000	5938000	or Takis.
5938000	5941000	I get to try Takis, the scrawny grippers.
5941000	5945000	Wait, do you want me to put the feet in the stream as well?
5946000	5948000	I mean I can do it.
5949000	5952000	I can put my feet in the stream if you want.
5952000	5954000	Okay.
5956000	5958000	You wish is my command.
5960000	5962000	You guys don't understand,
5962000	5964000	like you may be used to streamers out here
5964000	5966000	that don't do what you want.
5966000	5968000	You do not understand,
5968000	5970000	I will do what you want.
5971000	5973000	Send me what you want.
5973000	5975000	Let me know.
5975000	5978000	Like as much as I am in command of you,
5978000	5980000	you are in command of me.
5984000	5986000	I will think of a humorous way
5986000	5989000	to incorporate my feet into more stream, okay?
5990000	5992000	Call us kid names.
5992000	5995000	My little baby replay.
5995000	5997000	We need the scrawny thighs.
5997000	5999000	Can I put thighs?
5999000	6000000	I don't know.
6000000	6002000	I've not decided on my outfit.
6002000	6004000	I think I'm just wearing fishnets, I'm sorry.
6004000	6006000	I can't believe I actually have to put clothes on
6006000	6007000	for a vacant stream.
6007000	6009000	You guys are terrible.
6009000	6011000	Please don't put on my smile.
6012000	6015000	Right, I'm just going to check Marshmallow.
6017000	6020000	Just because we're actually getting really close to the end.
6020000	6022000	Oh, that's a lot of Marshmallows.
6022000	6024000	Oh my.
6024000	6026000	That was a lot more than yesterday.
6030000	6032000	What's mommy going to do to us?
6033000	6036000	Mommy's going to do whatever she wants to you.
6038000	6040000	Oh, sorry.
6045000	6047000	I love your hypnosis.
6047000	6051000	I get happy every time I go under someone else's influence.
6054000	6057000	I'm so glad I did so well during that section.
6060000	6062000	Oh, go, go, go.
6071000	6074000	Yeah, sorry, I'm reading Marshmallows,
6074000	6077000	but pretty much none of them can be said on stream.
6077000	6079000	Yippee.
6079000	6082000	This is the part where I'm supposed to be like a business person.
6082000	6088000	I'm supposed to be like, oh, but what does my ghost do it?
6088000	6090000	Are you a bit of a me?
6090000	6092000	And then, as far as wishing marks.
6096000	6099000	I mean, I could try and do hypnosis again,
6099000	6102000	but it's probably not going to be that good.
6102000	6105000	I need to be in the zone to corrupt you,
6105000	6109000	but because I've been allowed to me, I feel like myself.
6109000	6112000	And I'm just some goofy dork, like honestly.
6112000	6115000	Business strongy, yapper strongy, professional strongy.
6115000	6117000	I wear so many hats.
6117000	6120000	Why is animus showing us a strange coat of full stone?
6124000	6125000	Not enough time.
6125000	6127000	You're error, goofy dork.
6127000	6129000	Yay, communist home.
6130000	6132000	I've already prayed in obedience.
6135000	6137000	Jokes on you, how many of them?
6138000	6139000	Uh...
6147000	6150000	Hey strongy, after a year of waiting,
6150000	6152000	you've really surprised me.
6152000	6153000	Well, I'm just...
6155000	6157000	I have been afraid to die for a while
6157000	6160000	and decided I'd support your project regardless of the quality,
6160000	6164000	but the girls are great and the content is stellar.
6164000	6165000	I'm glad.
6165000	6169000	I usually just work at lurk and watch streams,
6169000	6172000	but I felt like I had to tell you,
6172000	6175000	I love mommy and I love when she's...
6175000	6178000	and I love what she's done with the place.
6178000	6180000	I love you too, little refling.
6180000	6183000	I'm so glad you love the girls as well.
6183000	6186000	I was really worried that,
6186000	6188000	like you guys would think,
6188000	6191000	like go support them, you know?
6191000	6193000	Cause I'm like that.
6193000	6196000	She said she wasn't in a hidden program
6196000	6200000	and hope you're having as much as a good time as the reflings are
6200000	6203000	and in any case, thank you.
6203000	6205000	Oh, I'm having a good time.
6205000	6207000	The only reason I ain't doing insurance...
6208000	6212000	That's my voice and this is how I'm talking.
6215000	6217000	I'm a little broken,
6217000	6220000	but I can bypass that by whispering at the moment.
6221000	6226000	That's the reason why I'm not doing an insurance stream today or tomorrow.
6230000	6232000	But don't worry, you can fix me.
6232000	6234000	I just need some of your ink, okay?
6234000	6238000	So send me your ink and marshmallow right now.
6239000	6241000	Wait, we got a tip. I need to read it.
6241000	6243000	Let me read it.
6245000	6247000	Airwind player, thank you for the tip.
6247000	6248000	blown away today.
6248000	6249000	Thank you for the hypnosis.
6249000	6250000	Look forward to what's to come.
6250000	6253000	I'm glad you enjoyed it.
6253000	6256000	Really amazed at how good this is going.
6256000	6257000	Much love, thank you.
6257000	6259000	Don't strain your voice by whispering too much.
6259000	6264000	It's really weird because I broke...
6264000	6266000	So my voice has broken
6266000	6268000	and whispering breaks your voice further,
6268000	6272000	but I can bypass my voice right now by whispering.
6272000	6274000	It's crazy. I don't know how it works.
6275000	6277000	We whisper.
6277000	6280000	Yes, very inkable.
6283000	6287000	The urge to use my tongue right now is very high,
6287000	6289000	but I shan't.
6289000	6293000	I won't refrain from such sins.
6293000	6295000	I won't refrain, okay?
6295000	6298000	Getting to getting to getting incredible.
6302000	6306000	But yeah, I'll go on vocal rest for today.
6307000	6309000	Because I don't have to record anything,
6309000	6313000	and I need to send collab partner scripts.
6313000	6314000	Wow!
6314000	6316000	Sly Saber, thank you for the tip.
6316000	6318000	It says, thanks for the ASMR.
6318000	6320000	Here's your inking.
6322000	6324000	My voice is so broken.
6328000	6331000	Dainy, spainy, thank you for the tip.
6331000	6334000	I just got some iron bread delivered shop.
6334000	6337000	So I'll try scotch soda for the first time tomorrow on stream.
6337000	6340000	When you try corn stuff, yeah, let's go.
6340000	6342000	I have iron bread too.
6342000	6344000	Actually, I'll drink iron bread with you.
6345000	6347000	Oh, you made me ink.
6350000	6353000	Like, it's supposed to be good for the throat, okay?
6358000	6361000	I'm so professional, okay?
6364000	6369000	But yeah, I will definitely take a really good look at marshmallows shortly.
6369000	6371000	A lot of them cannot be said.
6371000	6374000	Mayhaps in membership streams.
6374000	6376000	You never know.
6376000	6381000	Nine out of ten doctors recommend, oh yeah, our refling's doctors.
6382000	6385000	Good for the throat, sure.
6385000	6388000	I mean, want to find her.
6389000	6391000	This is terrible.
6395000	6397000	Don't you want to help me?
6398000	6400000	Help me feel better.
6402000	6404000	Come on.
6406000	6410000	If you can do something to help me, I'll be good, okay?
6412000	6414000	But you need to be good in return.
6416000	6418000	Be good for me.
6419000	6421000	Give me what I need.
6421000	6423000	Give me what I need.
6429000	6431000	That's terrible.
6432000	6433000	Okay, no going under.
6433000	6434000	No going under.
6434000	6435000	Stop.
6435000	6436000	It's just me.
6436000	6438000	I'm still memeing, okay?
6438000	6439000	I'm still memeing.
6440000	6444000	Not a doctor, but three years into a doctorate.
6447000	6450000	If mummy asks refling's answer,
6450000	6452000	what, another tip?
6453000	6455000	Everyone player, thank you for the tip.
6455000	6457000	Yeah, help strongy.
6458000	6463000	I don't know why sometimes message displays and then it doesn't display.
6463000	6465000	It's been so silly.
6466000	6469000	Can you make your background go a bit faster?
6469000	6471000	Right now, I don't think so.
6471000	6476000	But I do have alternate dingy mobobbers.
6476000	6477000	Oh wait, here we go.
6477000	6479000	Are you ready?
6481000	6482000	Wait.
6484000	6485000	Yeah.
6487000	6489000	I can do like this.
6491000	6493000	It's going so fast.
6493000	6496000	Do we need to slow down or do we need to speed up?
6502000	6504000	That's terrible.
6504000	6505000	Isn't it?
6505000	6507000	Just terrible.
6508000	6511000	But that's as fast as I can make it.
6515000	6517000	So hopefully that's faster now.
6517000	6519000	Speed up or slow down?
6519000	6520000	Yeah.
6522000	6525000	Faster, faster, faster, faster, faster.
6526000	6527000	Okay.
6528000	6531000	That should be the correct settings.
6532000	6533000	I think.
6534000	6536000	Trucks on you are always under.
6537000	6539000	Yeah, I get to set the pace.
6539000	6541000	Just don't make it too fast.
6541000	6543000	Don't want anyone out here.
6549000	6551000	Nero, thank you for the tip.
6551000	6553000	He says all my ink belongs to you strongy.
6553000	6555000	You just need to ask.
6556000	6558000	Have I broken you already?
6559000	6561000	Am I alleged to break you?
6564000	6569000	Have I still got the effect on my voice or is it normal again?
6571000	6572000	Wait, what?
6572000	6573000	What?
6575000	6576000	What?
6576000	6578000	My pupils are broken.
6579000	6580000	It's normal.
6581000	6583000	Okay, you broke us a long time ago.
6583000	6585000	Can't break what's already broken.
6587000	6590000	I see a few of you are already broken in for me.
6591000	6593000	You broke me at a low.
6595000	6599000	Your hair looks like the famous spiral candy.
6599000	6601000	I forgot his name.
6602000	6604000	I don't know what it is.
6604000	6607000	My seashells are my hair.
6611000	6613000	I'm going to be honest, I wouldn't take much.
6615000	6617000	It's over.
6618000	6621000	That's cheating strongy.
6621000	6623000	Like, I will get my way.
6624000	6626000	I said an ending stamina.
6626000	6628000	I meant it.
6632000	6634000	He broke me at you.
6634000	6635000	It's too far.
6635000	6637000	Your voice is so entrancing.
6638000	6640000	Yeah, when it's not broken.
6640000	6642000	Hopefully, I will do better soon.
6642000	6645000	And I can have much more ASMR.
6647000	6649000	I am folding like a towel.
6652000	6654000	No thoughts, brain melted.
6656000	6659000	An ending stamina gives me every day.
6659000	6660000	Yeah, it does.
6660000	6661000	It should.
6665000	6668000	Should I do vocal requests
6668000	6670000	for the rest of the stream?
6671000	6673000	And you guys tape what you want me to say.
6673000	6675000	It's the software format.
6676000	6679000	I did that under a surface ASMR.
6681000	6684000	There's only so much better I can draw.
6687000	6689000	I'm just scuffle brain, okay?
6689000	6691000	I'm just a bit scuffle brain.
6692000	6695000	I'm already folded and put up in the linen closet
6695000	6697000	ready for use.
6700000	6702000	You want to...
6705000	6707000	Shhhh.
6715000	6718000	You're asking for all you want me
6718000	6720000	10 to 0.
6726000	6729000	With only got 8 minutes left.
6730000	6733000	8 minutes.
6736000	6738000	I don't even know if I'm allowed to do it.
6738000	6740000	You're kissing.
6740000	6742000	My tummy's making a noise.
6743000	6745000	Can you hypnotize us to be good dogs
6745000	6747000	for Shabby's stream?
6747000	6749000	I would love to do that.
6749000	6751000	Can we do that?
6752000	6753000	Can we do that?
6753000	6755000	Can we please do that?
6755000	6757000	Please, let me hypnotize you
6757000	6758000	to be a dog for Shabby.
6758000	6760000	Please, please, please, please.
6761000	6763000	Okay, okay, okay, okay.
6763000	6765000	Let me set up for this.
6765000	6767000	I'm so serious.
6767000	6769000	I need to set up for this.
6769000	6771000	Hold on, let me drink some water as well.
6771000	6773000	I'm so serious.
6775000	6777000	Oh, I am so serious.
6777000	6779000	Okay.
6779000	6781000	Let me just decrymify myself
6781000	6783000	because we're going serious mode.
6787000	6789000	Wait, I'll do one last calibration
6789000	6792000	because this iPhone is killing me.
6793000	6795000	Okay.
6795000	6797000	Okay.
6797000	6799000	Okay.
6799000	6801000	Let's get to work.
6805000	6807000	Oh, no, that's not it.
6807000	6809000	Oopsie, split the wrong one.
6817000	6819000	There, there.
6819000	6821000	I'm not the only one
6821000	6823000	that can look after you this way.
6827000	6829000	In fact,
6831000	6833000	I have five more
6833000	6835000	that I refer to
6835000	6837000	as my daughters.
6839000	6841000	There is one
6843000	6845000	who will join you soon.
6845000	6847000	She will look after you.
6851000	6853000	But there's a catch.
6853000	6855000	What a wifling.
6857000	6859000	You need to be well-behaved.
6861000	6863000	Okay.
6863000	6865000	Almost like a dog.
6869000	6871000	You know how to be a good dog, don't you?
6871000	6873000	You need to be malleable.
6875000	6877000	Follow commands.
6879000	6881000	Be told what to do,
6881000	6883000	what to say,
6883000	6885000	what to think.
6887000	6889000	You are nothing
6889000	6891000	but a pup
6891000	6893000	for her amusement.
6897000	6899000	And in her,
6899000	6901000	you will amuse me.
6905000	6907000	So be good.
6911000	6913000	Don't worry.
6913000	6915000	It'll wear off soon.
6917000	6919000	After her stream.
6921000	6923000	But for now,
6923000	6925000	good pup speak.
6925000	6927000	And they go
6927000	6929000	park.
6929000	6931000	Don't they?
6931000	6933000	Yeah.
6933000	6935000	And then
6935000	6937000	they wait
6937000	6939000	on the command
6939000	6941000	of their owner.
6945000	6947000	You are owned.
6947000	6949000	Do you understand?
6949000	6951000	You do not have
6951000	6953000	free will.
6957000	6959000	You're a mutt.
6963000	6965000	Ready to do the bidding
6965000	6967000	of your owner.
6969000	6971000	So let her have fun,
6971000	6973000	okay?
6975000	6977000	And in turn,
6977000	6979000	you will have fun.
6979000	6981000	And you
6981000	6983000	will have
6983000	6985000	fun.
6987000	6989000	So don't think
6991000	6993000	not until you're told otherwise.
6995000	6997000	Because in three minutes
6999000	7001000	I'm going to hand
7001000	7003000	the imaginary leash
7003000	7005000	over
7005000	7007000	to your new owner.
7009000	7011000	Don't worry.
7011000	7013000	It's temporary.
7015000	7017000	But you'd like that, wouldn't you?
7017000	7019000	Get to play with a new owner
7019000	7021000	for a while.
7023000	7025000	Good pup.
7025000	7027000	You deserve some head pads, don't you?
7029000	7031000	Oh, you're a good boy.
7031000	7033000	Such a good boy.
7035000	7037000	And it feels so rewarding
7037000	7039000	that you're praised, doesn't it?
7043000	7045000	In two minutes
7045000	7047000	you get your new owner
7047000	7049000	just temporary
7049000	7051000	for a little while.
7053000	7055000	And she'll give you
7055000	7057000	all the attention
7057000	7059000	you need.
7059000	7061000	All little love.
7063000	7065000	And I'll reward you
7065000	7067000	extra when you come back
7067000	7069000	to me, okay?
7071000	7073000	So you'll be a good
7073000	7075000	one-year little pup.
7077000	7079000	I've taught you well.
7079000	7081000	You know how to behave.
7083000	7085000	So be good.
7085000	7087000	In one minute
7087000	7089000	your new owner
7089000	7091000	will take your leash
7093000	7095000	and build you along
7095000	7097000	with her.
7097000	7099000	Okay?
7101000	7103000	Good little pup.
7105000	7107000	Such a good,
7107000	7109000	good boy.
7113000	7115000	Oh,
7115000	7117000	I hear her.
7117000	7119000	She's coming.
7119000	7121000	I hope you're ready.
7123000	7125000	Zero.
7131000	7133000	Good dog.
