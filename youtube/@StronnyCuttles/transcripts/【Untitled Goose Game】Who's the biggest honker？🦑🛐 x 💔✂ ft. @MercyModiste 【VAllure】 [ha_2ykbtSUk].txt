washer but mersey gets first person motion sick so we actually can't quite play power
washer the way others might um Danny reset reset are we lobby
your idea I have streamed the game audio to you so I don't know why your discord discord can't
hear the audio as well my discord can't hear the audio and oh but I the monitor sound is as high as
it can and if it if I make it any higher you're going to you're going to sound a lot I'm going to be
a bit too much now don't get me wrong I do appreciate stop streaming turn on please turn on

audio yes at mersey right go live and then go on discord and open up that stream that I've just
given you if that does not give you the audio I am stumped for what we're supposed to do okay

I heard it it's such a quiet honk oh you can hear my weak one my weak one
okay hold on let me wait if it's too quiet I wonder why it's too quiet
how about that how about that it's still quiet but it's here like I said it's a little low
the tiniest honk oh no I can't move my volume any any higher either that's the problem
she's gonna um maybe if I can move the monitor sound up I mean I can do it one more time one more time
I
do you hear that bell I hear no the tolling bell is coming for us jeez that's pretty good
okay yeah input for some reason mersey can also control me in the game I don't I don't know
how you've managed that but we have literally I can retake control of myself if I want but

that's not the way it should be
okay why can't i not put it on you oh

the table we broke something about the table we broke hold on what's up with the table
can add a table now this one oh it's how we get out we go up the table now to go into
another garden you want to move on to the next one we can come back to this plot plot we'll come
back to to miss to the garden to miss as soon as we scare the mister we call her miss crack pot

objective we're not doing we're not going to be promised i'm just i'm just crouching around in
your garden i ain't doing nothing what we're doing we're watched through the fence he can't see us
but we can see him perfect we're we're such we're such bad geese literally what is going on
night wait why is he so what's the word he's so suspicious yeah he's paranoid he like can't even
enjoy his tea come on oh oh oh okay rub in the yeah okay okay go go go go go go
no you're supposed to spell it my good sir did i not give you a freighter in that
right take a sip hey hey wait that wasn't what we wanted wait nothing marked we wanted him to spit
out the tea so he has to drink the whole thing i think
no steal his shoes don't have to tell me to it hi oh no i didn't mean to do that i meant steal
your loafers sir yeah i'm sorry them loafers go sit down sir go sit down i want your shoes
oh he didn't like that i like him he's totally like he's tolerating us but he's came to not
uh what no
oh no i missed my turn there can't get it no can you
yeah out of bounds that's that's right you aren't coded to come over here only i'm coded to come
over here but you know oh did he just boot me because i took us through you don't deserve it
maybe use the big bell behind him oh that makes perfect sense actually to do the bell when he goes
for a sip can we see him do a sip from that side one of us has to go on the other side i think
i think we uh i think we both have to do it or else we can um hello i'm at a kakaya hello
excuse me madame i need the bell i shoot madame i need the access to the bell you're in my way
madame madame please refrain from getting in my way right oh sorry okay that's definitely what
you're supposed to do when he sips his tea we just need to hang around while he does his wee tea
okay we're getting there we just need our handheld through the game just a tiny bit okay just a
tiny bit of hand holding right so we need to wait until the suspiciousness is come back
he should he should drink his tea after he's done his like suspicious animation
oh wait i'm trapped i'm trapped we're good i didn't this game is a lot harder than i thought i thought
this was like a i say this about every game i play oh i thought this was a child's game why is it hard
and i don't know if that's just a reflection on me but he's still
no the bell thing needs to be set up again she's not fixing it
oh no you're right oh sugar what is she trying to fix right now oh well okay um she's currently
painting take the bow i didn't know i can take her paint and brush oh i can draw her paint and
brush one or the other good night starting about wake up in four hours bro you're gonna be charred
um no was that supposed to take the paint brush oh she's gonna fix the bell okay
and then do you want to put the duck in the other garden i wonder if that's what it is
you put the statue in the other garden so then she forgets she even had a duck
no i must tell you okay there we go okay it's now out of bounds so she can't ask for the duck
anymore it doesn't work like that and now we wait for him to drink his dang tea that must be frozen
solid at this stage because there's no way please ask for tea are you coming in this garden
your audio might be cutting it for me on discord a little bit
oh sorry no that was all good the knee buddy so she knows it's fake right
she tells you to move does that need to paint you
so she's fixing that wait can i put the bow on you now because we got rid of the statue
no i've done you didn't give me time right go paint right go paint geez let's do this bell for
this poor man oh he's about to do his animation okay no he was supposed to do the drink tea
animation why maybe this will help your mindset for the puzzle the game is meant a single player
everything can be done solo you mean we could be doing this twice as fast but taking us three
times as long hold on a minute what's going on here these allegations oh yes dumb because you're
right i mean it's not wait water in this dish maybe i'm like trying to look around for hints

We finished oh, we gotta go back. Oh, no
Oh makes the ground keepers wear his own hat. We don't have that
But we're allowed to move on
How do we make you accidentally went back to the beginning of the game wait, so we need to go the other way to unlock the new map
Hold on Ray. Let's go the wrong way. Let's try the other only we would manage that honestly
Again, try that again. We'll go up
I'll blame the French this time. Let's see. Je ne comprends
Where the fuck we is?
Wait, do we need to go along that bridge there?
No, maybe
I'm
Swimming up the water
To say water and French you say
Why is the French why is water male in French I do not know no

Wait, so we're sick where it matters
Yeah, exactly. That's how I like
We're casually just flirting

I was just turned into them being nice to each other while you're surprised
Wait, we're surprised that we're nice. You ask you want me to be mean. Yeah, like literally would you thank you Scott?
Literally what you want me to be like all you Canadians with your cube a cost and all that and your friend your fake French like what wait
so we weren't supposed to go here or
What's the deal? I'm a drama
This was the way to go because we opened a gate to get here and there was a new camera angle
Well, I guess we'll move this way now
Moving on up. Maybe it was like a shortcut to go back. I guess a
Bit a bowl of water. Okay. Well considering. Yeah, there's literally an arrow. That's like you're actually meant to go this way
Dumb a oh hey a car. Let's trap someone in it
So, this is how mercy lured her first victim

Responded to that ad she put up cute yandere in your area seeking you now two miles away. She's honing in on your current location
Oh
Eat a minute or over objectives get into the pub

Suggestion to a wasp girl a what oh see bug girls are an issue and I'll tell you why actually development
I don't mind telling you this
Really because of like arachnophobia, for example or insect phobia is a very real thing
It is it has a possibility of putting the girl at a disadvantage

You want to play again
Mr. No, he just wants to look at us. That's fine. Um, oh
So, you know how you have two eyeballs
Yeah, do you want to know I made sure you had two eyeballs because
It's actually really startling if a vtuber only has one eye or there's like a mono eye like monster girl type thing
and it's kind of one of the rules of like
Development is you can't wait. Can she see me under the table and
You must have a girl with like two eyes that isn't too freaky or you're putting them at a severe disadvantage
And like it kind of goes the same for vtubers that might have multiple eye designs
like it's
Unfortunately, just like a weird
What is going on over here are we doing the dishes? Oh
