07:00.000 --> 07:04.280
I feel so so inspired.

07:04.280 --> 07:08.720
I mean, my people used to do that, that's so cool.

07:08.720 --> 07:11.680
I mean, I've never fed on a human before,

07:11.680 --> 07:14.840
and the smartest thing I've ever hypnotized is a seal.

07:14.840 --> 07:20.560
But learning that my ancestors used to eat humans by the literal boatloads was amazing.

07:20.560 --> 07:22.960
I couldn't wait to grow up and eat my fill.

07:22.960 --> 07:27.200
Fat ones, tall ones, skinny ones, even hairy ones.

07:27.200 --> 07:32.800
Though I learned our people aren't as feared by humans as they once were.

07:32.800 --> 07:41.680
My ocean, my home, humans defile it with their presence, worse still, they toss their filth into it,

07:41.680 --> 07:48.160
further insulting us. How could this have happened? How were we brought so low from our past?

07:48.160 --> 07:53.760
They used to tell legends on every port that made even the most straight-laced superstition scoffing

07:53.760 --> 07:59.200
marines keep on the back of their minds. They would dedicate figureheads of their ships in respect

07:59.200 --> 08:07.600
to our beautiful yet delicate bodies. They put us on every map, but now? Ugh, disgusting humans.

08:08.800 --> 08:14.880
One night, I envisioned a genius plan, the first strike in my crusade against the human world.

08:17.120 --> 08:22.400
I would infiltrate in hijack a fishing vessel and use it as my own pirate vessel with a crew of

08:22.400 --> 08:28.240
hypnotised thralls. I was going to wage a once siren war against all of humanity.

08:28.240 --> 08:35.360
It was going to be perfect, and I definitely would have won. That was until I envisioned a plan

08:35.360 --> 08:42.640
that was even more perfect. Er, well, at least more time efficient. Making my way below deck,

08:42.640 --> 08:51.360
I made a strange discovery. The humans were hypnotised by their own choice. I couldn't believe it.

08:51.360 --> 08:58.800
I looked at boat after boat. These humans charmed like a siren's spell, even dedicated their

08:58.800 --> 09:07.600
lives to their chosen idols. These idols they fawn over were these sirens too. That's it. That's

09:07.600 --> 09:12.720
the secret to defeating the humans. I'm going to find the secret to their magic and harness this

09:12.720 --> 09:19.680
power myself and bring power back to my people. I must gather fame, fortune, scandals, anything

09:19.680 --> 09:25.120
and everything to grow my influence over mankind to bring sirens back into the minds of the people.

09:26.320 --> 09:31.360
But I'm not just going to tip the scales. I'm going for complete domination.

09:33.200 --> 09:39.120
Every human will bend to my will. All will be cheering for their own demise. I will be the

09:39.120 --> 09:45.120
instrument of karmic justice. The world will worship me and praise my name as I bring about their

09:45.120 --> 09:51.680
end. I will march every human under my control into the ocean and my people will chant my name as they

09:51.680 --> 10:02.320
have a feeding frenzy that has written into legend. Though that's a very long term goal.

10:03.520 --> 10:11.200
With every big venture, whether business wise or lifestyle, every big undertaking starts small scale.

10:11.280 --> 10:21.280
Right? Hmm. So, I think I'll start with you.

10:34.400 --> 10:39.280
You wanted a feral kusugaki? I gave you a feral kusugaki.

10:41.200 --> 10:44.320
You wanted a doten hag? I gave you a doten hag.

10:47.680 --> 10:51.200
You wanted a dorky yandere? I gave you a dorky yandere.

10:54.880 --> 10:58.960
You wanted a masochistic brocon? I gave you a masochistic brocon.

11:01.680 --> 11:05.680
You wanted a milk dominatrix? I gave you a milk dominatrix.

11:05.680 --> 11:18.160
And now, I bring you the vichu bird that no one asked for. A god damn nutty cuttlefish.

11:36.160 --> 11:46.160
No copyright. No copyright. No copyright intended, bros. Come on, come on, come on. Relax, relax.

11:47.760 --> 11:59.360
Did I kick or did I fucking kick, ladies and gentlemen? Have you enjoyed your evening so far?

11:59.360 --> 12:03.360
Have you been warmed up by my girls?

12:03.360 --> 12:13.360
Who stole your heart the most? Was it A.C., the feral polar bear, or was it Azura, the literal definition of mommy milkers?

12:13.360 --> 12:23.360
Or what about Mercy, the yandere that can never love right? I mean, she got plenty of love to give, doesn't necessarily mean you're gonna be alive at the end of it, okay?

12:23.360 --> 12:31.360
But hey ho, you know, you still get love done at the end of the day. Or was it Emmy, the most controversially created character of all time?

12:31.360 --> 12:39.360
But hey ho, look, we're just gonna skip past that. You know, if you ignore the lore, everything else is fine. It's fine. It's fine. Stop worrying.

12:39.360 --> 12:45.360
You guys are such a blurry war, honestly. Or was it Madame Shuby herself?

12:45.360 --> 12:55.360
Because, you know, gonna be honest, didn't really get many requests for a hypnotic cuttlefish, that's Scottish, but hey ho, hey ho, that's how it goes, that's how it goes.

12:55.360 --> 13:05.360
There's something made me, let me formally introduce myself. Look at these sleighs, they're so pretty, they're so pretty.

13:06.360 --> 13:15.360
I, ladies and gentlemen, am Strony Cuttles. Please, Cuttles, the surname is because I'm a Cuttlefish.

13:15.360 --> 13:24.360
Oh, shock of any. And Strony, because I am Strony, the daughter of the gamer Strontyum.

13:24.360 --> 13:30.360
My dad's gamer tag is Strontyum. No, it's not actually Strontyum, before you're like, oh my god, you just dox your dad.

13:30.360 --> 13:37.360
No, relax, it's not actually literally really, you know, Stronyum, but I'm Strony, Cuttles, I'm named after my dad.

13:37.360 --> 13:41.360
My dad's gamer, and I wouldn't be here without him, you know, because he came from his ballsack.

13:41.360 --> 13:49.360
Anyway, age, age, ladies and gentlemen, oh, yet again, I have failed the VTuber challenge of tell us your age.

13:49.360 --> 13:53.360
It's not really looking good, okay, it's not looking good.

13:54.360 --> 14:01.360
Cuttlefish normally live to a year, so time's ticking, time is ticking.

14:01.360 --> 14:08.360
Anyway, my birthday is October 10th, which is actually National Squid and Cuttlefish Day.

14:08.360 --> 14:14.360
They're both cephalopods, so I don't mind sharing that birthday with the Squid VTubers if there's any of these out there.

14:14.360 --> 14:25.360
My height is 162cm, which makes me 5'3", because I forgot to update the slide like Adapte, but hey, hold, we're here now.

14:25.360 --> 14:40.360
For my languages, turns out, if you're born in Scotland, the British government recognises Scottish slang as its own language, so in your face, I can speak two languages, so...

14:40.360 --> 14:42.360
It's fantastic with that.

15:11.360 --> 15:12.360
Show us your plaster.

15:12.360 --> 15:13.360
No!

15:13.360 --> 15:14.360
Oh God, can you see it?

15:14.360 --> 15:16.360
Wait, you're not supposed to see that part, yeah!

15:17.360 --> 15:20.360
Like, I had to censor myself, my design's a little saucy.

15:21.360 --> 15:22.360
Anyway, what was I saying?

15:22.360 --> 15:28.360
A-Smart, if you like A-Smart, me and my gen mates are all literally A-Smart out of the wazoo.

15:28.360 --> 15:32.360
So don't be shy to like or subscribe on any of them.

15:34.360 --> 15:36.360
I'll give you a bigger hint than that, but hey, hold.

15:36.360 --> 15:42.360
I like seeing victory on my screen, because I could use any tiddly wink of serotonin possible.

15:42.360 --> 15:47.360
And, you know, you get it from playing multiplayer games, and you're in the same boat as me.

15:47.360 --> 15:49.360
And I also like plasters and band-aids.

15:54.360 --> 15:56.360
For no nefarious reason, of course.

15:56.360 --> 16:02.360
For my dislikes, grrr, you know, hate is a strong word for my dislikes instead, grrr.

16:02.360 --> 16:04.360
I don't like bullies in video games.

16:04.360 --> 16:08.360
Your teammates aren't often a magically beat MLG pro, so relax.

16:08.360 --> 16:11.360
You don't have fun, it's a multiplayer game, it's a game.

16:11.360 --> 16:12.360
Just enjoy yourself, okay?

16:13.360 --> 16:14.360
I don't like serious people.

16:14.360 --> 16:15.360
I don't like seriousness.

16:16.360 --> 16:24.360
I think my gen mates can all pray for each boutch that I am the most un-serious and ridiculous.

16:27.360 --> 16:28.360
I can't be serious.

16:28.360 --> 16:29.360
It's terrible.

16:29.360 --> 16:32.360
I'm the most unprofessional person they've probably ever worked with in their entire life.

16:35.360 --> 16:38.360
And I don't like Mongolian throat singing.

16:38.360 --> 16:39.360
I'm so sorry.

16:40.360 --> 16:44.360
People seem to really like it, but I don't.

16:45.360 --> 16:46.360
It doesn't sound nice.

16:47.360 --> 16:51.360
So, I apologize to the one Mongolian throat singer that's watching right now.

16:54.360 --> 16:55.360
I just can't.

16:55.360 --> 16:57.360
Okay, I'm nice and generic.

16:57.360 --> 16:59.360
Sorry, there's nothing interesting about my taste.

17:00.360 --> 17:03.360
Movies, Lord of the Rings, best as we come.

17:03.360 --> 17:06.360
Animes, nice and generic again.

17:06.360 --> 17:07.360
Books.

17:07.360 --> 17:08.360
I actually started reading books this year.

17:08.360 --> 17:12.360
I know it sounds crazy at the end because people read books in general.

17:12.360 --> 17:13.360
Me?

17:13.360 --> 17:15.360
However, I started this year.

17:15.360 --> 17:21.360
I really like dystopian books that talk about human nature and how humans are stinky poo poo heads.

17:21.360 --> 17:23.360
For some reason, they just really capture me.

17:23.360 --> 17:25.360
I like being depressed after reading a book.

17:26.360 --> 17:30.360
For my music, Hatsune Miku and Atarashi Gako,

17:30.360 --> 17:32.360
I want to see them live if it's possible.

17:33.360 --> 17:35.360
Yeah, sorry, it's like choking my spit.

17:38.360 --> 17:39.360
Oh, yeah.

17:39.360 --> 17:41.360
Just a wee bit of a gamer.

17:41.360 --> 17:42.360
A tiny bit of a gamer.

17:43.360 --> 17:44.360
It doesn't mean I'm good at games.

17:44.360 --> 17:46.360
Now, before there's that one person that's like,

17:46.360 --> 17:48.360
eh, you've played all these games.

17:48.360 --> 17:49.360
That means you're an MLG pro.

17:49.360 --> 17:51.360
No, relax, relax.

17:51.360 --> 17:54.360
I've played games full stop, okay?

17:54.360 --> 17:56.360
These are the games that I remember playing

17:56.360 --> 17:58.360
or just kind of like have a good,

17:58.360 --> 18:00.360
yeah, play them type thing, okay?

18:00.360 --> 18:03.360
So, you might have a few things in common.

18:03.360 --> 18:05.360
I could, you know, move out of the way.

18:05.360 --> 18:08.360
There's some Lego games, I still love my Lego games.

18:08.360 --> 18:11.360
But yeah, these are all the games that I remember playing.

18:11.360 --> 18:13.360
There's tons that I've obviously missed out on

18:13.360 --> 18:15.360
that are like so tiny that it's kind of hard to mention.

18:15.360 --> 18:17.360
But there's a big old square red for you

18:17.360 --> 18:20.360
as we see it was about an Xbox gamer to apologize.

18:20.360 --> 18:22.360
The old Call of Duty days.

18:23.360 --> 18:24.360
Yeah.

18:25.360 --> 18:27.360
For my goals,

18:27.360 --> 18:29.360
I want to get monetized on YouTube.

18:31.360 --> 18:33.360
So, feel free to subscribe

18:33.360 --> 18:35.360
because we have been called like crazy

18:35.360 --> 18:37.360
since announcing ourselves.

18:38.360 --> 18:39.360
And we need watch hours.

18:39.360 --> 18:42.360
So, don't be shy to rewatch anything

18:42.360 --> 18:44.360
that is offered on the channel to you.

18:44.360 --> 18:46.360
I want to stream so much

18:46.360 --> 18:50.360
that you can basically read everything in my voice.

18:50.360 --> 18:52.360
And, you know, you'll be Scots yourself

18:52.360 --> 18:54.360
and you can apply for citizenship

18:54.360 --> 18:56.360
and all that good stuff.

18:57.360 --> 19:00.360
I also want to create a mega Ace more collab

19:00.360 --> 19:01.360
with my gen mates,

19:01.360 --> 19:04.360
which I've already got quite a few on the way.

19:04.360 --> 19:06.360
So, don't worry, it's coming.

19:06.360 --> 19:08.360
You just got to wait, okay?

19:08.360 --> 19:11.360
I have a childhood dream, actually,

19:11.360 --> 19:13.360
of a 100,000 gamer score.

19:13.360 --> 19:16.360
And it's actually possible now with Xbox Game Pass.

19:16.360 --> 19:18.360
I would absolutely love to explore

19:18.360 --> 19:20.360
a heken amount of

19:22.360 --> 19:23.360
childhood games.

19:23.360 --> 19:24.360
And I would love to play

19:24.360 --> 19:26.360
like your childhood games as well,

19:26.360 --> 19:28.360
because obviously I was kind of at the mercy

19:28.360 --> 19:31.360
of what my dad would buy me for childhood games,

19:31.360 --> 19:33.360
so it doesn't quite count.

19:34.360 --> 19:37.360
So, here's a little fun factoid about me.

19:37.360 --> 19:40.360
I'm a wee bit of a workaholic.

19:40.360 --> 19:43.360
So, I would like to say that for every 1000 subscribers

19:43.360 --> 19:45.360
I get on my YouTube channel,

19:45.360 --> 19:47.360
I'm going to upload a celebratory

19:47.360 --> 19:49.360
really hard to say that if you're Scottish,

19:49.360 --> 19:50.360
celebrate it already.

19:51.360 --> 19:54.360
Ace more video, pair 1000 subscribers.

19:54.360 --> 19:56.360
I've already got like tons

19:56.360 --> 19:59.360
ready to go, so don't be shy.

19:59.360 --> 20:02.360
You know what to do, wink, wink.

20:03.360 --> 20:06.360
I also want to challenge myself.

20:06.360 --> 20:07.360
I want to collab.

20:07.360 --> 20:09.360
I want to make Ace more collab

20:09.360 --> 20:12.360
with over 100 different beatubers.

20:12.360 --> 20:14.360
And I'm actually so much of a workaholic.

20:14.360 --> 20:16.360
I already have three confirmed

20:16.360 --> 20:18.360
with beatubers outside of VLR, so...

20:20.360 --> 20:22.360
I'm very serious about that.

20:22.360 --> 20:24.360
If you ever have a 3DO, you're a beatuber,

20:25.360 --> 20:27.360
I'm coming to find you in your DMs.

20:28.360 --> 20:31.360
I would love if we could read Lord of the Rings together.

20:31.360 --> 20:33.360
I think it would be so fun.

20:33.360 --> 20:35.360
I'm not a very strong reader,

20:35.360 --> 20:37.360
but I think it would be really cute to do like a little

20:39.360 --> 20:40.360
before the end of stream.

20:40.360 --> 20:43.360
We read one chapter or something like that.

20:43.360 --> 20:46.360
And last, but certainly not least,

20:46.360 --> 20:48.360
I would love to get stream sniped.

20:48.360 --> 20:50.360
I absolutely adore it.

20:50.360 --> 20:52.360
I love playing multiplayer games

20:52.360 --> 20:53.360
where you can join me,

20:53.360 --> 20:54.360
and you can have an amazing time,

20:54.360 --> 20:55.360
and have so much fun.

20:55.360 --> 20:57.360
It's just one of my favourite things, okay?

20:57.360 --> 20:59.360
So please do not be shy.

20:59.360 --> 21:01.360
Every week I plan on playing multiplayer games

21:01.360 --> 21:03.360
where you can join me at any point.

21:03.360 --> 21:05.360
I will try to make them free and accessible

21:05.360 --> 21:06.360
as I can, but yes, yes, yes.

21:06.360 --> 21:08.360
These are my goals. Thank you, thank you, thank you.

21:09.360 --> 21:10.360
I'm dumb.

21:10.360 --> 21:11.360
Okay, I'm really dumb.

21:11.360 --> 21:13.360
I don't know how to come up with tags.

21:13.360 --> 21:15.360
I'm not funny. I'm not good with puns.

21:15.360 --> 21:19.360
So I am more than happy to take any suggestion.

21:19.360 --> 21:22.360
We can figure it out very soon.

21:22.360 --> 21:24.360
Don't worry, okay?

21:24.360 --> 21:26.360
My Oshi marks are squid,

21:26.360 --> 21:28.360
but I'm a cuttlefish,

21:28.360 --> 21:31.360
but squids and cuttlefish are cephalopods,

21:31.360 --> 21:33.360
so I don't mind sharing the emoji.

21:33.360 --> 21:35.360
And then the second emoji

21:35.360 --> 21:37.360
kind of looks like a man bowing.

21:37.360 --> 21:39.360
Hmm? Hmm?

21:39.360 --> 21:41.360
Maybe that is a hint to what I might

21:41.360 --> 21:43.360
try to make content-wise.

21:45.360 --> 21:47.360
And for fan names,

21:47.360 --> 21:49.360
there is only going to be one option.

21:49.360 --> 21:52.360
Come on, let's not beat around the bush.

21:52.360 --> 21:55.360
You are my refling.

21:55.360 --> 21:57.360
You will always be my refling.

21:57.360 --> 21:59.360
And thank you so fucking much for waiting.

21:59.360 --> 22:01.360
I have bloody missed you.

22:04.360 --> 22:06.360
Special shout out to

22:06.360 --> 22:08.360
Nari

22:08.360 --> 22:10.360
and Squishy Girl.

22:10.360 --> 22:12.360
You may have noticed a bit of a

22:12.360 --> 22:14.360
trending pattern, right?

22:14.360 --> 22:16.360
A bit of a trending pattern.

22:16.360 --> 22:18.360
Squishy Girl,

22:18.360 --> 22:20.360
conceptualized us all

22:20.360 --> 22:22.360
and now I helped out

22:22.360 --> 22:24.360
and made us come to life, which is beautiful, beautiful.

22:24.360 --> 22:27.360
And also, as a little mini announcement,

22:27.360 --> 22:29.360
the official VLR website

22:29.360 --> 22:31.360
will be updated shortly.

22:31.360 --> 22:34.360
And everyone who created the Gen 1

22:34.360 --> 22:36.360
is going to be credited on the website.

22:36.360 --> 22:38.360
So you will see these names very soon

22:38.360 --> 22:40.360
on that website once the update comes out.

22:40.360 --> 22:42.360
So thank you everyone who came together

22:42.360 --> 22:44.360
to make this fantastic gen

22:44.360 --> 22:46.360
of indulge.

22:46.360 --> 22:48.360
Oh, okay, okay, okay, okay.

22:48.360 --> 22:50.360
No, no.

22:50.360 --> 22:52.360
Most people get to do

22:52.360 --> 22:55.360
Oh, this is my gen mate's impression.

22:55.360 --> 22:57.360
Okay? Gen mate's impression.

22:57.360 --> 23:00.360
Me, oh no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

23:00.360 --> 23:02.360
I picked

23:02.360 --> 23:04.360
my gen mate's. Do you understand?

23:04.360 --> 23:06.360
I picked them, okay?

23:06.360 --> 23:08.360
They're all going to tell you why I picked them.

23:08.360 --> 23:10.360
You ready for this?

23:10.360 --> 23:13.360
Mercy's determination.

23:13.360 --> 23:15.360
She was going to make it no matter what.

23:15.360 --> 23:18.360
A little determining, like,

23:18.360 --> 23:21.360
the definition of mercy in the dictionary

23:21.360 --> 23:23.360
if you look it up, it just says determined, okay?

23:23.360 --> 23:26.360
There was no way and heck she was not going to get in.

23:26.360 --> 23:28.360
That's all I'm going to say on that one.

23:28.360 --> 23:30.360
And then Emmy

23:31.360 --> 23:34.360
I'm going to have to be

23:34.360 --> 23:36.360
Emmy

23:36.360 --> 23:38.360
say to someone

23:38.360 --> 23:40.360
who's being rid to her

23:40.360 --> 23:42.360
to keep themselves safe in Minecraft

23:42.360 --> 23:44.360
and then she instantly got the part, okay?

23:46.360 --> 23:48.360
I say, I say, oh, I say

23:48.360 --> 23:50.360
has fantastic

23:50.360 --> 23:52.360
experience

23:52.360 --> 23:54.360
in history and she's such a hard worker.

23:54.360 --> 23:56.360
She gives her best, okay?

23:56.360 --> 23:58.360
She gives everything 100%

23:58.360 --> 24:00.360
and it was absolutely beautiful.

24:00.360 --> 24:02.360
And she actually, she had the most

24:02.360 --> 24:04.360
professional application

24:06.360 --> 24:08.360
even though English isn't her first language

24:08.360 --> 24:10.360
and I'm like, god damn, A.C.,

24:10.360 --> 24:12.360
you're fucking impressive.

24:14.360 --> 24:16.360
Then Azura,

24:16.360 --> 24:18.360
okay, I describe Azura

24:18.360 --> 24:20.360
as my little diamond in the rough.

24:20.360 --> 24:22.360
Now hear me out before you're like,

24:22.360 --> 24:24.360
isn't that an insult? Relax.

24:24.360 --> 24:26.360
I'm not told the full story yet, my goodness, you're jumping the gun.

24:26.360 --> 24:28.360
I

24:28.360 --> 24:30.360
was going to

24:30.360 --> 24:32.360
cross off Azura's

24:32.360 --> 24:34.360
stream as I was reviewing her

24:34.360 --> 24:36.360
because she wasn't talking, she wasn't interacting

24:36.360 --> 24:38.360
and she wasn't really doing anything

24:38.360 --> 24:40.360
and then she said three words

24:40.360 --> 24:42.360
in that voice.

24:44.360 --> 24:46.360
Azura!

24:46.360 --> 24:48.360
She instantly became Azura.

24:48.360 --> 24:50.360
She said three words and she got the damn part

24:50.360 --> 24:52.360
and she was like, in that voice, in that part.

24:52.360 --> 24:54.360
I can't mimic her voice, okay?

24:54.360 --> 24:56.360
But

24:56.360 --> 24:58.360
I need gold.

24:58.360 --> 25:00.360
Rosyksu!

25:00.360 --> 25:02.360
Rosyksu.

25:02.360 --> 25:04.360
And Sheevee. Sheevee is everything

25:04.360 --> 25:06.360
I should have been in another life, okay?

25:06.360 --> 25:08.360
She is going very far.

25:08.360 --> 25:10.360
I'm very happy, absolutely.

25:10.360 --> 25:12.360
I could not have asked for

25:12.360 --> 25:14.360
better gen mates. I am blown away

25:14.360 --> 25:16.360
that these girls even have

25:16.360 --> 25:18.360
fucking applied to such a crazy idea.

25:18.360 --> 25:20.360
And here we are,

25:20.360 --> 25:22.360
debut and you guys have shown

25:22.360 --> 25:24.360
nothing but love and support

25:24.360 --> 25:26.360
and we are all so thankful.

25:26.360 --> 25:28.360
I'm sure I speak for all of us when we were like

25:28.360 --> 25:30.360
holy fuck, thank you.

25:30.360 --> 25:32.360
Because we didn't expect any of this.

25:32.360 --> 25:34.360
We're just like, yeah, we're just going to be my bird.

25:36.360 --> 25:38.360
Ray, let me take you to

25:38.360 --> 25:40.360
Zabbe.

25:40.360 --> 25:42.360
Oh, I forgot

25:42.360 --> 25:44.360
to pull you. It's for decoration, okay?

25:44.360 --> 25:46.360
The tentacle in the back is for decoration.

25:48.360 --> 25:50.360
I won't, no questions.

25:50.360 --> 25:52.360
Let me do the full body.

25:52.360 --> 25:54.360
Let's start with the full body.

25:54.360 --> 25:56.360
May have a bandaid on for

25:58.360 --> 26:00.360
reasons.

26:00.360 --> 26:02.360
But as you can see, I got some

26:02.360 --> 26:04.360
swivelly hips, thank you.

26:06.360 --> 26:08.360
We'll start from the bottom.

26:08.360 --> 26:10.360
You know how it is, okay?

26:10.360 --> 26:12.360
So if you didn't know, I actually

26:12.360 --> 26:14.360
have what's known as a French manicure

26:14.360 --> 26:16.360
and pedicure.

26:16.360 --> 26:18.360
So you can see my little

26:18.360 --> 26:20.360
toenails.

26:20.360 --> 26:22.360
This is French manicure pedicure.

26:22.360 --> 26:24.360
And then you go up my face.

26:24.360 --> 26:26.360
And

26:26.360 --> 26:28.360
don't even be careful at my thighs because of the bandaid.

26:30.360 --> 26:32.360
Is this smart? Is this white?

26:32.360 --> 26:34.360
Okay, okay, I don't think that's white. Okay, check it out.

26:34.360 --> 26:36.360
See look, I've got

26:36.360 --> 26:38.360
oh, my voice is cracking.

26:38.360 --> 26:40.360
I've got a French pedicure

26:40.360 --> 26:42.360
manicure. See?

26:42.360 --> 26:44.360
We're just going to skip past the bottom part, okay?

26:44.360 --> 26:46.360
And as you can see

26:46.360 --> 26:48.360
if you look really close to the elbows

26:48.360 --> 26:50.360
I have pearlescent

26:50.360 --> 26:52.360
to my outfit. My outfit isn't white

26:52.360 --> 26:54.360
it's pearlescent.

26:54.360 --> 26:56.360
So I shimmer as I move about.

26:56.360 --> 26:58.360
It's fantastic. And so there's my

26:58.360 --> 27:00.360
seashells at the top too.

27:00.360 --> 27:02.360
If you look at real close

27:02.360 --> 27:04.360
you have to really look for it.

27:04.360 --> 27:06.360
But look, I'm a shiny little seashell.

27:06.360 --> 27:08.360
What do you think?

27:08.360 --> 27:10.360
It's good, no?

27:10.360 --> 27:12.360
Yeah, I'm in the Yukata

27:12.360 --> 27:14.360
because

27:14.360 --> 27:16.360
it's a homage to Japanese culture

27:16.360 --> 27:18.360
because without Japanese culture, let's be honest

27:18.360 --> 27:20.360
maybe trippers would be here

27:20.360 --> 27:22.360
so

27:22.360 --> 27:24.360
you know, go a little bit catagona.

27:24.360 --> 27:26.360
Okay, let me

27:26.360 --> 27:28.360
let me get real close. Hopefully this isn't uncomfortable.

27:28.360 --> 27:30.360
I know some people aren't like

27:30.360 --> 27:32.360
the best with eye contact

27:32.360 --> 27:34.360
but look, don't, it's me. It's me, okay?

27:34.360 --> 27:36.360
I'm a brain.

27:36.360 --> 27:38.360
Oh, the star.

27:38.360 --> 27:40.360
I

27:40.360 --> 27:42.360
I like

27:42.360 --> 27:44.360
if I open my eyes

27:44.360 --> 27:46.360
it opens

27:46.360 --> 27:48.360
I love you so much.

27:48.360 --> 27:50.360
Oh and I'm sad

27:50.360 --> 27:52.360
I'm sad please.

27:52.360 --> 27:54.360
Better not upset me, go subscribe

27:54.360 --> 27:56.360
to my gem me. You upset

27:56.360 --> 27:58.360
me.

27:58.360 --> 28:00.360
I have pupil restrict like

28:00.360 --> 28:02.360
what did you say?

28:04.360 --> 28:06.360
I'm unamused.

28:06.360 --> 28:08.360
You failed me.

28:08.360 --> 28:10.360
I don't know, I can't do it.

28:10.360 --> 28:12.360
I can't do it the way she does it.

28:12.360 --> 28:14.360
She's just off the top of her head and I'm like

28:14.360 --> 28:16.360
These are my heart eyes. I love them.

28:16.360 --> 28:18.360
And like, okay

28:18.360 --> 28:20.360
this is just my opinion but do you see how

28:20.360 --> 28:22.360
my neck is doing that thing where

28:22.360 --> 28:24.360
in the chin area and it disappears?

28:24.360 --> 28:26.360
Oh, I love it so much

28:26.360 --> 28:28.360
in beach of remodels when they do it.

28:28.360 --> 28:30.360
Oh, I love it.

28:30.360 --> 28:32.360
I love it.

28:32.360 --> 28:34.360
You're good.

28:34.360 --> 28:36.360
You're trying to make me blush,

28:36.360 --> 28:38.360
would you?

28:38.360 --> 28:40.360
Have you ever seen a blushing coffee before?

28:42.360 --> 28:44.360
Oh, actually this is a very good point.

28:44.360 --> 28:46.360
Some people don't like

28:46.360 --> 28:48.360
backseat gaming.

28:48.360 --> 28:50.360
I'm the opposite.

28:50.360 --> 28:52.360
I'm very dumb.

28:52.360 --> 28:54.360
I'm very happy for you a backseat game.

28:54.360 --> 28:56.360
So you're probably going to see this one a lot

28:56.360 --> 28:58.360
if you care to watch me at any point.

29:00.360 --> 29:02.360
I got

29:02.360 --> 29:04.360
I don't know

29:04.360 --> 29:06.360
I swear

29:06.360 --> 29:08.360
I'm looking at my jammies all day.

29:08.360 --> 29:10.360
Like, come on, the designs are good.

29:10.360 --> 29:12.360
Don't lie.

29:12.360 --> 29:14.360
Oh, oh

29:14.360 --> 29:16.360
I might have spoiled it there

29:16.360 --> 29:18.360
but you know how

29:18.360 --> 29:20.360
cuttlefish have hypnotic patterns?

29:20.360 --> 29:22.360
May I please

29:22.360 --> 29:24.360
do this for you? Are you ready?

29:24.360 --> 29:26.360
I

29:26.360 --> 29:28.360
I

29:28.360 --> 29:30.360
Yes

29:30.360 --> 29:32.360
We're going to be using this for a lot of ASMR.

29:38.360 --> 29:40.360
You wouldn't fall for my hypnotic

29:40.360 --> 29:42.360
capabilities.

29:44.360 --> 29:46.360
But if you're really struggling

29:46.360 --> 29:48.360
like if you're really struggling

29:48.360 --> 29:50.360
How about this?

29:54.360 --> 29:56.360
Yeah

29:56.360 --> 29:58.360
Yeah

29:58.360 --> 30:00.360
Yeah

30:00.360 --> 30:02.360
Yeah

30:02.360 --> 30:04.360
It's over for you. Just admit it.

30:04.360 --> 30:06.360
It's over for you.

30:06.360 --> 30:08.360
I mean, how can you resist?

30:08.360 --> 30:10.360
How can you resist this little Scottish accent?

30:10.360 --> 30:12.360
Right

30:12.360 --> 30:14.360
Right, right attend

30:14.360 --> 30:16.360
Schedule time

30:16.360 --> 30:18.360
So

30:18.360 --> 30:20.360
my jammies are all doing

30:20.360 --> 30:22.360
debut 2.0

30:22.360 --> 30:24.360
which is fantastic

30:24.360 --> 30:26.360
Me on the other hand

30:26.360 --> 30:28.360
I'm exposing the damn company

30:28.360 --> 30:30.360
I've had enough of VLR

30:30.360 --> 30:32.360
I'm exposing every little

30:32.360 --> 30:34.360
dirty secret they have

30:34.360 --> 30:36.360
So if you're excited

30:36.360 --> 30:38.360
to know the ins and outs of what it's like

30:38.360 --> 30:40.360
to run a VTuber agency

30:40.360 --> 30:42.360
to create one, to fund one

30:42.360 --> 30:44.360
to know what goes on behind the scenes

30:44.360 --> 30:46.360
that's right

30:46.360 --> 30:48.360
and you can show up to my stream the more

30:48.360 --> 30:50.360
So

30:50.360 --> 30:52.360
Obviously

30:52.360 --> 30:54.360
I'm playing the greatest game of all time

30:54.360 --> 30:56.360
in my first week

30:56.360 --> 30:58.360
Assassin's Creed Brotherhood

30:58.360 --> 31:00.360
I will not be taking any statements

31:00.360 --> 31:02.360
any questions

31:02.360 --> 31:04.360
and any threats about claiming

31:04.360 --> 31:06.360
that Assassin's Creed Brotherhood is not the

31:06.360 --> 31:08.360
greatest game of all time

31:08.360 --> 31:10.360
So sorry, not sorry, but yeah

31:10.360 --> 31:12.360
We also have needy streamer overload

31:12.360 --> 31:14.360
James Cameron's Avatar

31:14.360 --> 31:16.360
which is such a niche game

31:16.360 --> 31:18.360
2 people who are watching this right now

31:18.360 --> 31:20.360
probably played it

31:20.360 --> 31:22.360
The multiplayer game of the week is old school runescape

31:22.360 --> 31:24.360
if you'd like to do some co-esting with me

31:24.360 --> 31:26.360
I'm also doing an ASMR stream

31:26.360 --> 31:28.360
and

31:28.360 --> 31:30.360
a hand cam stream

31:30.360 --> 31:32.360
where I'm trying foreign sweets

31:32.360 --> 31:34.360
or can die

31:34.360 --> 31:36.360
if you're American

31:36.360 --> 31:38.360
or if you're Australian

31:38.360 --> 31:40.360
you say lollipops

31:40.360 --> 31:42.360
So yeah, we did a little

31:42.360 --> 31:44.360
cheeky hand cam stream

31:44.360 --> 31:46.360
I think there's

31:46.360 --> 31:48.360
a few hand cam streams coming up from

31:48.360 --> 31:50.360
my gen mates already

31:50.360 --> 31:52.360
Someone was surprised I was doing hand cam

31:52.360 --> 31:54.360
and I'm like

31:54.360 --> 31:56.360
I mean

31:56.360 --> 31:58.360
we're not like

31:58.360 --> 32:00.360
I don't know what part kind of tips you off that

32:00.360 --> 32:02.360
we're not like other agencies unironically

32:02.360 --> 32:04.360
like was it the 80-20 split

32:04.360 --> 32:06.360
maybe did that tip you off

32:06.360 --> 32:08.360
or like the 100% marriage sales got the talent

32:08.360 --> 32:10.360
was it that part that tips you off that

32:10.360 --> 32:12.360
we're not quite like any other agency

32:12.360 --> 32:14.360
but yeah

32:14.360 --> 32:16.360
let's go to

32:16.360 --> 32:18.360
Chewatt

32:18.360 --> 32:20.360
that's a lot of movement

32:20.360 --> 32:22.360
but yes, that is my first week

32:22.360 --> 32:24.360
I'm pretty much an endurance streamer

32:24.360 --> 32:26.360
so good luck keeping up with me

32:26.360 --> 32:28.360
okay

32:28.360 --> 32:30.360
Emmy Dookie

32:30.360 --> 32:32.360
Emmy

32:32.360 --> 32:34.360
right

32:34.360 --> 32:36.360
thank you all so much

32:36.360 --> 32:38.360
we are all going to collectively have a 30 minute rest

32:38.360 --> 32:40.360
and then guess what

32:40.360 --> 32:42.360
you get to see us all interact together

32:42.360 --> 32:44.360
live

32:44.360 --> 32:46.360
okay we're going to be telling some funny stories

32:46.360 --> 32:48.360
some rather embarrassing stories

32:48.360 --> 32:50.360
but hey ho it's good content

32:50.360 --> 32:52.360
it's good content that's right

32:54.360 --> 32:56.360
and I will thank you

32:56.360 --> 32:58.360
also much for all the love that we've shown myself

32:58.360 --> 33:00.360
or my gen mates at will

33:00.360 --> 33:02.360
and we will see you in 30 minutes

33:02.360 --> 33:04.360
you will automatically be redirected

33:04.360 --> 33:06.360
into the lovely group room

33:06.360 --> 33:08.360
and we will see you in 30 minutes okay

33:08.360 --> 33:10.360
can you wait 30 minutes

33:10.360 --> 33:12.360
30 more minutes

33:12.360 --> 33:14.360
okay I'll see you then

33:14.360 --> 33:16.360
okay thank you so much

33:16.360 --> 33:18.360
bye

33:38.360 --> 33:40.360
you
