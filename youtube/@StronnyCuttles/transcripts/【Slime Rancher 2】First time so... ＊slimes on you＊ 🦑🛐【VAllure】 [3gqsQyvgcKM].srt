1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,880
Oh my god, I'm so fucking late. I'm so sorry I was recording ASMR. Bodlings! I promise I'm

2
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:18,240
here as well, Bodling. Okay? I don't even have a cup of tea! I don't even have a cup of tea!

3
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:23,440
Hold on, let me open up the bottle. Oh my god, I'm so sorry. I'm so fucking sorry.

4
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:30,960
You can tell with the vomit in there, honestly. I'm sorry, thank you for

5
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:35,520
going to put on me such a thing. Oh god, that's really bad, thank you.

6
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:45,920
Okay, okay, model up, model up. Okay, and then put the lay on. I'm so sorry. No, what the

7
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:54,000
minute? What the minute? I'm so sorry. I just recorded ASMR like right there. I recorded,

8
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:00,080
I did not realise how long I rambled for. I recorded an ASMR shot and then I recorded

9
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:05,360
an ASMR video where I was showing you how I record ASMR. So it was like ASMR inception.

10
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:15,120
I'm so sorry. I'm so, so sorry. Can you hear me testing? I'm so sorry. Okay, right. I don't think

11
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:24,160
I need to recalibrate my model. It looks like it's too interesting. Okay, right. I'm so sorry. I

12
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:30,640
just recorded like a 30-minute handcam ASMR video though. I'm gonna send it away to the editors

13
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:35,200
so there's gonna be a lot of content, okay? Right, let me put watermelon away. What the

14
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:39,760
melon? Wait, oh no, watermelon's in the beach of studio with me. Watermelon, I'm sorry, but

15
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:47,360
it's not cool. Oh, you can hear the game? You can hear the game? Oh, it's very loud. Oh, okay. Slime

16
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:53,760
Rancher is in a pre-release stage. Wait, it's not even finished. I thought it was finished.

17
00:01:54,960 --> 00:02:00,960
We can hear it loud and clear. Okay, I've lowered the desktop volume. A very small percent,

18
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:09,520
epileptic seizures. Oh, yeah. What kind of game are we getting in? Epileptic seizures.

19
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:14,000
It's early access, but it's not really early access. No, I'm...

20
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:21,440
Okay, so just as a quick tip, but I've never played any Slime Rancher game. I have no idea

21
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:27,440
what it's about in terms of I've seen someone put slimes in a cage. So I'm gonna just say the slimes

22
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:34,080
are the reeflings that escape the farm and I need to go get you. Slime girl time, you wish.

23
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:40,400
You wish I was getting a slime girl. It's no happening, let it go. Save icon, little... Oh,

24
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:51,680
can I get a green one? Oh, one for reefling, no green one. Uh-huh. Oh, I'm gonna put my col...

25
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:58,000
Right, fine, I'll put my collar on. Hold on, let me take that as well. I can put it on. Oh, sorry,

26
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:05,120
you just let me click it. Thank you for the tip. Fine, the collar goes on. As if I'm not supposed

27
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:09,840
to put a collar on you because we're in the fucking farm today. I'm bringing you back to the farm.

28
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:15,200
At work, I can't wear mine. No. Game is a bit too loud. Right, let me turn that shit down.

29
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:23,760
Let me turn the background down there. I turned it down by five decibels.

30
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:32,640
You sell the... I sell reefling poop. Damn, the ASMR game, we're really struggling out here.

31
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:40,480
Oh, why am I lagging? Excuse me, don't lag again, do you understand me? Is there a green icon save?

32
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:49,520
Oh, there's not one green one, fine. We'll put Snuffy on it. Tutorial enabled, yes. Tar. Tar are

33
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:53,280
unruly creatures that sometimes spawn in the world are granted. They will damage the player,

34
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:59,040
spoil food, and devour other slimes. Disabling can reduce difficulty, I'll survive. Feral slimes

35
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:02,560
appear in small numbers of locations in the world. They're a bit grumpy and will often damage the

36
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:09,760
player. They're setting enables or decibels or... Nope, that's fine. Modifies the damage received

37
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:16,400
to the player. Receiving can reduce difficulty while increasing it. Oh, the smallest I can do

38
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:21,600
is point five. I'm going to be honest, I didn't want to play this game for the first time and get

39
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:30,480
soft locks. I'm here to collect slimes, I don't know about you. Suck up the good slime and make

40
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:39,360
it long. Put with a bit of a majome, anation. Let's just make it ink, you. Oh, lore. After a long day

41
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:46,560
of slime wrenching, Beatrix LeBeau was enjoying a cool glass of carrot juice as she watched the

42
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:54,560
sunset across the slime scene. Suddenly, a boat arrived at her dock with nothing inside but a

43
00:04:54,560 --> 00:05:05,280
mysterious letter. What do you think then? You have explored the far far region range range

44
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:14,160
from the dusty shores of the dry reef to the furthest reaches of the perilous glass desert.

45
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:23,360
But there are well yet uncharted Beatrix LeBeau. Rainbow Island awaits you, climb aboard if you're

46
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:34,320
ready for a new adventure. Okay. Beatrix excitedly boarded the boat and it took her across the slime

47
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:40,960
sea. Eventually, she saw an oil and unlike anything on the far, far range mountains, trees and

48
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:45,840
grasses, all in an array of colors that danced and moved like a dream.

49
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:55,440
How will you read it if she's Scottish? As she explored, she found an abandoned conservatory

50
00:05:55,440 --> 00:06:02,320
overlooking the rest of the island. Curiously, it was equipped with everything a slime

51
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:11,040
wrencher like her would ever need to wrangle slime, start a farm and build gadgets.

52
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:24,800
And so a new adventure begins. Beatrix tightened her boots, readied her backpack and set out to

53
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:34,960
explore Rainbow Island and uncover its mysteries. And just really lovely. What is this trace that

54
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:44,720
Theresa here? Ever get that feeling? A deja vu? Whoa, my PC can't handle this. What? Right, WASD.

55
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:56,240
Right, stop slime pedia. No, calm down. Frame rate? Can I be that? I can't be the frame rate.

56
00:06:56,240 --> 00:07:04,720
Go and put it like, what are these? No, right, hold on. This is absolutely caca. Right, go easy.

57
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:10,320
Yeah, low, do low. Right, apply, apply. Thank you because I don't know why the PCs act

58
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:14,800
unlike it's having a stroke. The only one having a stroke in here is me. Right, jump and sprint.

59
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:19,040
Oh my god, I love a good game. Jump and sprint, jump and sprint, jump and sprint. I'm on my

60
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:23,920
Harry's land. Oh my god, why? I'm just going to say it's loading in asset packs. How do you

61
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:30,880
vac like a rancher? Your vac pack can vac things up and store them in the tank. I assume you.

62
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:38,720
Okay, we have obtained our first slave, the first refling slave for the farm. Oh my god. Okay,

63
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:45,360
I love this game already. Slimes are key to use. Shoot slimes through a coral barrier,

64
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:53,040
a corral barrier, not coral. Coral. Okay, okay. Are you ready to be imprisoned for life but in

65
00:07:53,040 --> 00:08:01,440
exchange you get unlimited milk? There they go. Oh my god, three little reflings jumping in the pen.

66
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:10,000
One fell out and bumped his head and you go. Okay, that's cute. I'll allow it.

67
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:18,080
Shit slimes. No, damn party. They give us ink apparently. So I just go exploring.

68
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:24,160
Okay, let us analyze this game content. Why is of course some sort of sleep chamber? Oh,

69
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:30,320
it's got takeaway. It's got catch up on system offline. Right. Okay, we need to restore the power.

70
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:40,080
I hope I'm not supposed to be doing anything. New shifting colors like a dream fading just as

71
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:47,920
quickly. Oh yeah. And you come. Ha ha, got you. Oh my god, they're coming. Oh, there's cat. Oh my

72
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:52,960
god, wait, we can farm farm. New to vac pack. It's a rancher's best friend, carrots. Oh my god,

73
00:08:52,960 --> 00:09:01,360
everyone get in. Do I need to like charge this? Whoa. Okay, this is come. Right, good boy. Who's

74
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:07,760
that good boy? You're coming on the farm. The milking farm never in. There's sheeby slime.

75
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:18,800
Hello. Hi. What do you do? Oh my god, it's literally called cotton slime. Oh my god, we have

76
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:25,360
sheeby. We have reflames, right? We just need Emmy, Azura, everyone else. Oh my god, this is

77
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:35,680
amazing. And you come. Okay, suck them all up. They've all come in. Hi, Johnny. Do not say the

78
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:42,560
slimes are pooping. Don't be a doodly. Poggle fruit. Oh my god, so that's so Poggish champus.

79
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:49,280
Right, so then go back and then whoa. Oh my god, this game is lagging low. Why?

80
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:54,080
Maybe that's what they meant when they were like, I, the game's early access.

81
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:06,080
The Puggers. Exactly. That's a secret path. Okay, not bad though. I do apologize for

82
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:12,640
broken my voices. I didn't make a cup of tea. I made one an hour ago when I woke up. I do apologize

83
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:19,280
for the lack of nothing anywhere. Guess who didn't eat anything yesterday and took medication to

84
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:29,280
sleep and then passed the book out. Okay, right, what? Food like fruits, veggies or chicken are

85
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:36,400
used to feed. Try shooting a bit of food. Yeah, it's hungry. Look, I'm supplying mommy's feed in here.

86
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:48,640
Whoa. How do I take this? Oh, I can walk in, but they can't come out. That's exactly how it should

87
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:57,520
be. We lost one. Wait, did I kill one? Feed yourself. Yeah, I'll do it after soon. Like, I feel fine.

88
00:10:57,520 --> 00:11:05,280
That's something so surprising. I need to suck these. You acquire? No, not you, darling. No, no, I need

89
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:10,800
to, I just need the thingy, my bobbers. Stop. I don't know what the slime is. Right, there we go.

90
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:17,120
Pause the game again. No, I'm fine. I'm fine. Mommy shot a carrot to my noggin. Well, it was better

91
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:24,800
than me firing it elsewhere. Hey, how did you get there? Oh, my inventories feel right. Okay,

92
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:31,760
that's fine. That's fine. Right, what's this deal? The plot market, any plotters, the plot market

93
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:39,280
gives you new bucks for your hot end plots. Shoot a plotter into the plot market and earn yourself

94
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:48,160
some cash. Right, okay. Ah, I see. Okay, and now what? That about covers the basic. Now it's time

95
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:52,880
to get out there and explore. No matter where your adventure takes, always keep curiosity and kindness

96
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:58,560
in your heart. Wait, why is this game so wholesome? What the heck? How did I get on your pen? I have

97
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:07,680
bunnies on my inventory. Oh, it's down here. Hello. Why does it look like a horror game? What? Is this

98
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:14,320
my evil lab where like, I fucking take you down into the basement to like, milk you endlessly?

99
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:19,680
Like I have seven fucking rods in here. Honestly, I could see myself doing that.

100
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:31,120
Press F to activate. What are you? Oh, I can upgrade my backpack and stuff. What is this?

101
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:38,960
Cotton plot? What is it? Resource harvester as a resonator mechanism that shakes those science

102
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:46,160
resources from not... I don't know what that is. Sync with your body thingy. Put your heart rate up,

103
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:56,240
cotton. That one's pink. A heart module. Jetpack. I can fly. Tank booster. Improved nano storage

104
00:12:56,240 --> 00:13:02,000
tech that allows your tank to hold 30 units of whatever it can say. So how do I get a new tank?

105
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:08,000
Oh, we're learning. We're learning. That's what happens when you play a game for the first time.

106
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,360
You have to learn everything. What's that? Okay.

107
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:23,920
It's making noise. Let's not go jumping off the map just yet. You can send us anytime.

108
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:30,000
I'm getting news. These are changing. Your interests are changing because of me.

109
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:38,800
But yes, the good news is I have never recorded the audio of all the shorts. I now need to pilot

110
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:50,480
my mech to synchronize with the footage. And then that's pretty much all my pre-made shorts.

111
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:54,000
And then I'll go back to working on the girl. Sheebie's waiting on an ASMR script.

112
00:13:54,720 --> 00:14:01,040
Um, I might do a few membership hi-to-fag streams pop-up ones just to write you.

113
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:09,920
You think you can just escape? How dare you get in there? You're going to the milking farm. Press F to activate.

114
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:20,560
Slime agitation. An air net is a force fire that covers the top of the cage. It can take a few hits

115
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:29,680
before. How strange, right? So if I go here, happy nothing beats the taste of growing stuff.

116
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:37,040
Akute raises chickens. We can have chickens for fun. You never told me that. Oh, thank you for the tip.

117
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:40,880
And before anyone's like, you've not got your collar on. What are you here, huh?

118
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:45,760
What are you here? You make a new pen using fun. Akute. So how do I do it?

119
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:56,080
Right, buy it. Are you sure you want to purchase? Yeah. And put the bunnies in it?

120
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:03,040
Are they going to come flying out? Do I need to put like a barrier thing on top?

121
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:12,480
Oh, shit.

122
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:20,560
Yeah. I still got one, Mary's still got one, and now it's my turn. Wait, do you guys not like the fruit?

123
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:27,440
You don't like my offerings to you? No, no, no. Don't come back in me. Stop. Right. Stay here.

124
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:33,600
Wait, do you like it then? Okay, they like it.

125
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:45,440
Right. And then if they like it, but the cot, she be only like carrot. Surprise, surprise.

126
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:55,600
I'm trying to very gently pick up around bunnies like carrot ones. I'm lint. Oh, is this our house?

127
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:58,480
Can we go inside? Oh.

128
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:06,720
I've never been more disappointed in my looks. Right, okay, let's pop these away.

129
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:14,800
Right. What is that? It seems like we can unlock two more slimes, the gray and the blue. Let's go

130
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:25,040
find a gray and a blue slime. Can I have a thing that lets me? I said there is a farm plot. I think

131
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:33,200
we're going to have to do that. Yeah, garden by, yes. Now what? Shoot a fruit or veggie into it

132
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:37,280
to begin growing more of that type. Shit, I just got rid of them all. Right.

133
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:50,480
I hurt. Oh my God, we have a chicken. That was really lucky that it came over to me. Right,

134
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:55,280
we're going to keep the chicken on the inventory. Right, give me these carrots. Right, okay, we'll

135
00:16:55,280 --> 00:17:02,560
go start growing carrots. We have a chicken, gray, matter, turning blue. Feed it to the slime. Feed

136
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:09,120
the chicken to the slime? No, we're going to have a chicken farm. Don't be so stinky. Right, funk.

137
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:16,560
Oh my gosh. Wait, I like this game. I thought it was going to be residential.

138
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:22,960
If this game is anything like the first part, this is going to be Mama Dream Incarnate,

139
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:28,800
being an architect, making money from it, upgrading the farm for even better architecting,

140
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:33,920
endless loop. Literally, I'm enjoying this. Like, I thought this was going to be like a

141
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:41,040
kind of game. No, this is cute as anything. I love it. Oh, sorry. Go eat some carrots.

142
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:44,640
Oh, two of them responded to that.

143
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:52,240
Right, and then pick up the gems, and then we'll get more water, more water, more money,

144
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:55,120
and then we'll make the chicken cap, and we're already on our way.

145
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:04,800
Well, we're never getting a good thing. I like it here, honestly. Right, I'll let the carrots

146
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:10,720
grow. We're going to go see what we can do. Maybe we can grab another slime. This is

147
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:17,840
out of order as well, but Wi-Fi system offline. Oh my god. I honestly thought this game was just

148
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:24,640
like a little two-minute resident, two-minute two-hour resident sleeper. I can...

149
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:34,960
A phosphorous slime. Oh my god. No, no, no. Give me the carrots because I need to feed the rabbit.

150
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:37,440
Right, I don't need any more pink slime. We've got enough pinkie.

151
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:44,640
We've got sheevee slimes coming out of nowhere. I want the nighttime ones. I'm here for the

152
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:51,280
nighttime gems. I need to, like, get in. Right, give me them.

153
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:59,760
What are you? Hello? Oh no, are you not well? Accessing GG Log. Well, here we go again. I'm

154
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:04,080
sending the drones out to all their original scouting locations. Once I confirm the coordinates,

155
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:08,960
our conditions are the same. I'll get to work this place. I still remember being in awe of the

156
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:14,800
rainbow field. It felt like being in a beautiful dream and I guess in a way it was because it

157
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:25,440
ended much too soon. Oh dear. Can I fix him? No, I can't. I can't fix him. I love that noise.

158
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:40,160
Okay, I don't need these guys. Come here. Come in. Stop it. Did he just ink on me? Are you

159
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:45,680
inking on me again right now? I need 20 years and then I'll put you some on your captive.

160
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:47,440
What's up ahead?

161
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:58,320
Oh, there's, like, so many. I love it. I can fix him, honestly.

162
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:05,360
Okay, I don't have enough inventory space. I can do carrot. Give me your carrots. Oh,

163
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:08,880
they're not growing yet. Oh, what are you? Hello? Press F to activate.

164
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:16,800
Uh, wait, it goes like, okay, this and this. That's how big it is, right? Wait,

165
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:23,760
why is it three out of three? Oh, wow. Oh, wow. I've been going one direction. There's

166
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:30,080
literally three more ways I can go. Hmm. Seems to be something important back here as well.

167
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:43,760
No, we would never. Another chicken. Okay, you have egg? No. Oh, the rooster is considered

168
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:52,560
different from a hen. Hmm. Oh, yeah. Are you supposed, oh, my, oh, my Largo. Largo slimes

169
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:57,200
are large slime hybrids formed when a slime eats a floor unlike them. Back to keep them on your

170
00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:01,440
nozzle and shoot them to send them flying. What? I'm using it like a fucking bomb?

171
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:06,080
What the? That was just mean. This just looks like bullying.

172
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:17,040
You? I guess I can't get past this until something happens.

173
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:21,600
What are you? Ooh, water lettuce. We've not unlocked that yet.

174
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:30,720
Oh, my God. This game is so cute. Big bunny. Shoebie. I'm bouncing on Shoebie's head.

175
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:35,440
You can feed the big one. Uh-oh.

176
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:45,920
Do you want chicken? You don't want chicken. I'm afraid I'm out of carrots already. Oh, dear.

177
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:50,480
You don't have enough carrots in the old tub.

178
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:58,000
Whoa. What is going on? It's like a feast.

179
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:11,200
Um, imagine. Uh, right. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Cotton. I want to keep. I don't want to

180
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:15,760
drop anything. Right. Get rid of that one. I'm going to take the blue one so it'll be more.

181
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:19,520
God, we're all nomin' on stuff. What are we nomin' on?

182
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:28,240
That's like a fucking feast over here. Is it like a feast every night on the island?

183
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:31,600
Everyone seems to be getting along rather well, which I'm really happy about.

184
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:37,920
Go back and make some space. Yes. I'll get rid of the Firefly one. Oh, we're finally

185
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:41,920
finally it's conveniently transport resources and ports to the refinery where you can

186
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:45,280
excessively for your slime science in the lab.

187
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:56,480
Does that mean send it back or is that I'm lost? I need to go what way?

188
00:22:58,240 --> 00:22:59,360
A little bit more to the right.

189
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:05,280
Can you feed the poop to other slimes to get combo breakers?

190
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:12,800
Oh, tar. Tar slime. I'm off. That was like something.

191
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:19,760
I'm not watching that person die. This slime didn't do anything wrong.

192
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:30,160
That was so mean. There was a flybot. Oh, is that not the same one I spoke to earlier?

193
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:36,000
Whoopsie. That was so mean. Born 4K. Exactly.

194
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:42,960
New message. Do you have a new message waiting at the comm station? Oh, is the comm station back up?

195
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:45,600
Right. I need to...

196
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:54,000
How is there... How are you showing up? There's more chickens just chillin'. They're ready to be

197
00:23:54,080 --> 00:24:01,920
sucked in. Sucks in. Sucks in. Yeah, for all the cutesy in this game, the car can be terrifying.

198
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:07,600
Maybe I should have turned them off, but... Right, I get a lot of money for them. 300.

199
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:17,520
I need to get a new plot. Are you escaping? Oh, oh, so, so, oh, mummy, mummy. I want you to do

200
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:22,480
this to me. Mummy, mummy, mummy. I want you to do this and that. Eh, why are you trying to escape then?

201
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:28,720
Why are you trying to escape? I never said you could. I could.

202
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:36,480
Keeping chickens in their place prevents the uprising.

203
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:46,080
Eh, what? What is going on? It wasn't me. Okay, right, and then we put you in.

204
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:52,320
Are you just gonna fly out? You guys do have the ability to fly, I think.

205
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:54,880
Yeah, literally what?

206
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:04,800
What? High walls. I don't have the money.

207
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:12,800
Are the chickens uprising? Are the carrots ready to harvest?

208
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:17,600
Okay, I can make some emergency money with the carrots and trying to put a freaking

209
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:25,520
tall thing on top. They need a sun protector. Are they dying? Oh my, I never even thought about that.

210
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:32,640
Right, hurry up. Hurry up and start shitting. Start inking. Do you understand me? Start inking

211
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:40,000
right now. That's right. That's right. I want to see all that ink, baby. I want to see it all.

212
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:45,200
I want to see all that ink. Wait, you come in here with me.

213
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:52,160
Nope. Right, and then go out.

214
00:25:54,720 --> 00:26:00,720
What are you doing? Are you eating my fucking? Why are you so big? Are you eating stuff you

215
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:06,800
shouldn't be? Be honest. Right, you come in here. I need one of you's on hand. Right, I need to buy

216
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:13,040
a sun protector. Got it. Surely this will have enough money now. Right, sun protector. I have

217
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:16,160
300 bucks. I need a sun protector. Unless I just suck them all in.

218
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:25,920
Come. Oh my God, not one of them is left. Get in sick. You naughty nailies. Right, sun protector.

219
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:34,080
Hurry up before you all die because you've been silly, Billy. I'm hungry. Who makes two greens,

220
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:38,880
honestly? Is there all going to perish? Get inside my gun. At least you're safe inside there.

221
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:45,920
I've definitely lost a few. I've only got 14. I thought I had like 20. Right, press F to activate.

222
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:49,600
Ear net. Solar shield. I don't have enough.

223
00:26:54,880 --> 00:27:00,640
Oh, 500 and then I get like something that automatically does it. Auto feeder as well.

224
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:09,440
Oh my God, that's so good. Right, solar shield is 400 bucks. Can I like speak the, you get it?

225
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:17,200
You better stop. Oh, you're like coming out with coins on your own though. Okay. I mean,

226
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:21,680
I'm not going to come for him. Hello, mom. Hello, refund. What a cute little game.

227
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:26,880
I just think it's not like identified as finished yet.

228
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:36,000
Right, you get in. Oh, no. Well, you've done it now. You've done it now. Yeah, we're here.

229
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:40,480
You're going to die to the sun because you couldn't help yourself. How is there so many

230
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:46,160
pigs? Stop. Stop being smart and gathering like in dragon quests where they like stack up on each

231
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:55,920
other. I see one of these. I'm going to try and get it. What do I need? 450? I'm going to say

232
00:27:55,920 --> 00:28:02,880
that they're probably going to perish. Oh, I don't have enough. I need more carrots.

233
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:10,080
We cannot be stopped. Literally, you're bursting it. Look at you doing it again. You're stacking

234
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:15,280
on each other to get out. What do you mean I don't milk you enough to get you to stay around?

235
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:21,440
My nonsense is this. I'm just going for food. Right, there's no carrot there. That's fine.

236
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:28,880
I just need food. Food, food, food, food, food, food. Give me food. Give me food. Give me food.

237
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:40,320
For the reason why I need food. I need food. I need food. What are you? Whoa.

238
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:50,240
A cell heart. Used as a fabricator to upgrade the back hearts module. Okay. No, no, give me these.

239
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:58,080
Okay, I have carrot and I have two galorebs. Resource harvester upgrade required.

240
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:05,040
Well, I can grab more chains, I guess. No. Right. You might as well come with me.

241
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:15,360
What would be? Oh, jeez. There you go. What are these? A Q-Berry, delicious and sweet,

242
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:22,160
and they never roll off the table. I need food. Right, food first. I know those courts equal money,

243
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:27,520
but if I come back with, like, I'll load it right into the water, you know. I just need carrots,

244
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:34,080
really. If I get the bunnies full, they can combine. They're getting, reeflands are getting stronger

245
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:41,360
than me. They're better than me. They're faster than me. It's not looking good. I don't know if I

246
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:51,840
should put the Q-Berry down. Where? I'm struggling with the fine food. Right, where they're slain,

247
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:59,200
there's food, so I've got to get these. Should I just go on a run where I pick up three diamonds

248
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:04,320
that come off of them? Right, I'm heading back to the conservatory with my two carrots. Yeah,

249
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:13,040
that's gonna really tip me over there. I guess a Q-Berry is what they're gonna... Right, two

250
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:21,760
of you eat that. Do you eat Q-Berry? No! Who eats Q-Berry, then? Nope, nope, take that out. Right,

251
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:29,040
give me that. Do they make... Do they ever make the courts on their own?

252
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:40,640
Can I throw up? I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry to do this. I genuinely am so sorry. Get the

253
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:51,920
fuck out of here. Was that what I was supposed to do? I don't know what I was supposed to do.

254
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:56,800
I didn't know what I was supposed to do. I'm like, get out of here. You're eating my

255
00:30:56,800 --> 00:31:07,600
purr babies. Oh, literally, my purr babies didn't deserve that. Okay, 450. Can I sell slime?

256
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:15,920
Like actual slimes? Okay, not to be con... Can I sell them? No, okay, you can't sell them.

257
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:22,880
But they do seem to poop on their own. Stop coming out of your pen! How is there a bunny in your pen?

258
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:34,240
Sheeby, the harlots, the reeflings... What's going on? Right, I've got four, three, nine. What was I

259
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:39,920
doing with that? The solar one, so I can do the... So I can keep these guys alive, right? Solar

260
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:48,000
shield. Bye, thank you, yes. A solar shield will encase the corral in a dim shade, protecting

261
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:53,360
slimes that are sensitive to light. Okay, but are they gonna go flying out? It's my question.

262
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:58,560
We'll ensure that even the bounciest of slimes will have difficulty escaping. An air net is a

263
00:31:58,560 --> 00:32:05,840
force bar that covers the top of it. It can take a few hits before needing to recharge. Air net or high

264
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:18,240
wall. Okay, this is getting rather intricate. I take back all my compliments about this game.

265
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:25,440
Right, how much is a farm? $2.50, that's very much like... Or how much is a chicken farm? We need,

266
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:33,440
obviously, we need our chicken farm. Okay, it's $2.50, that's not that bad. Air net is also tar protection.

267
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:42,400
Have you guys played this game before then? You're real gamers who actually play video games,

268
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:52,640
not like me. Not like me, he does it for male attention. Why aren't you growing? I think I might

269
00:32:52,640 --> 00:33:00,640
need to drop the cubaries in favor of something else. I want to keep the chickens. They seem decent.

270
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:05,200
Okay, I see these little diamonds, we're just gonna grab them.

271
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:15,680
Do they like put them out naturally? Can you guys keep doing it? Right, did that activate you or not?

272
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:20,720
Sending the original drone out to the... Right, okay, no, we did interact with that one. Upgrade

273
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:26,800
for the resource, that's the water one, which we don't have yet. Mom, we have different diets,

274
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:34,000
only the pink leaflings are omnivores. Okay, okay, okay. I'm just gonna get rid of that.

275
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:41,840
I'd rather pick up little pieces now. If you guys are pooping out little pieces, I'm gonna pick them up.

276
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:52,320
You're inking everywhere, good. I wonder if I get rid of the... No, don't eat it. No, you stinker,

277
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:57,520
I was selling these pieces. Oh wait, I don't... Right, you know what? There's fucking chickens

278
00:33:57,520 --> 00:34:03,920
everywhere, just do what you want. Do what you want chickens, you win. I'm picking up all these like

279
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:10,160
monies because I'm needing to upgrade the farm. The farm needs a big upgrade, but I keep messing

280
00:34:10,160 --> 00:34:17,520
it off, but there's not enough. Give me it. Give me all these little pieces. I just want to be able

281
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:24,560
to empty my inventory of the solar one. Okay, they're pooping, they're pooping. I'm getting them,

282
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:29,840
I'm getting them, I'm trying to listen out to win the next one poops. I'm like, come on, come on,

283
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:38,240
give me that, the court. Okay, we'll move on to the next area. Okay, those are the chicken. Are you

284
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:45,760
eating the chicken? What are you doing? You are, good boy. Give me. No, not you though. Keep eating

285
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:53,600
the chickens, go on a big chicken feast. Refinery links, you keep saying that, but I don't know what

286
00:34:53,600 --> 00:35:02,880
it does. Oh, that doesn't work. You keep saying that, but I don't know what it means. I saw that up there.

287
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:07,600
Hey, I saw that, you pervert.

288
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:25,280
Oh my God, it's a tabby. They must eat chicken. Oh my God, they must eat chicken.

289
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:38,240
Oh, they're so cute. Oh my God. Give me all 20. I'll take 20 of them right now.

290
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:43,680
No questions asked. That is so cute. Right, I'm off. I'm putting them in.

291
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:53,440
They're so, so cute. Oh, those are nickel ones. I wonder if they're worth any more. Press F to

292
00:35:53,440 --> 00:36:00,400
activate. Okay, we have more of the map unlocked. Jesus. Right, what we do have to go to get back.

293
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:10,320
Straight ahead, roughly. Oh, he's eating. What are you eating? You never warned me how cute

294
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:17,520
this game was. I can't believe it. There's a cave in here. Did we go exploring? Hello, Mr. Cave.

295
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:24,320
Oh, it's not much of a cave. It's like a bypass. Hello. Do you have things I can sell? You do.

296
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:29,360
Thank you. This will greatly help with my investment of the nickel. Why is it so cool?

297
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:40,000
I go around the corner. I see a water thing. I see the world's smallest fucking chicken.

298
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:44,160
Is that a chick? It must be a chick. There's no way that's supposed to be a chicken.

299
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:47,280
Nearly. I don't even believe it.

300
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:55,600
Warning video gave me contained unreasonable amount of cuteness. It is, and it does.

301
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:04,720
Oh my god, I can like harvest all their poopies. Right, it makes it a lot easier that I can like

302
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:09,840
make money without having to make money on inside the farm. Like, they're just pooping,

303
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:12,880
pooping up. They're pooping up a storm right now. Am I going the right way?

304
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:19,520
Kind of. I'd like to break it for the most part. No, I'm away.

305
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:31,920
No, sorry. No, no, no, no, no, no. I want these. Don't throw them away. I want those guys.

306
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:39,680
You're upsetting me, video game. Today I kidnapped 20 reflux. Oh, hello. What are you?

307
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:47,520
Diet fruit. Oh, they're not going to move out of the way until I feed them. Snorlax style, like Pokemon.

308
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:51,680
The Snorlax is in your way yet again. Are you kidding me right now?

309
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:55,120
I had a map. It is just for you. I knew you would love this game.

310
00:37:55,680 --> 00:38:01,280
It's so cute. It's like a very relaxing game. I'm not sure if we're going to like finish the

311
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:06,320
campaign mode or anything like that. Oh, I forgot I had a message. I completely patched it. Sorry.

312
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:11,840
There, there's a bit of a Scottish slang. Fuck NL, you guys are escaping everywhere.

313
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:18,720
A message. System offline. A message? System back online.

314
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:27,920
Victor. Hello. Hello, Beatrix. Do you read, mate? Testing, testing. Perhaps you are lost at sea.

315
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:32,880
Taken away, but like with serious boat. Never to be. Oh, no. Just forgot to turn your display on.

316
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:37,360
Nice to see your face again, Beatrix. I missed you greatly. My dear friend.

317
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:43,760
Well, I'm quite excited for you to partake in a new adventure. I already have data that might

318
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:49,520
complicate this. Fair enough. Thank you, Crazy Jessie for the tip and Frostino for the tip as well.

319
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:55,760
Sorry, I'm being really bad at saying your names. Last night, I received a message from some sort of

320
00:38:55,760 --> 00:39:01,280
artificial intelligence program. It's written in code, but not one I recognize. I'm in the process

321
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:08,160
of analyzing it, but I am certain that this message was sent from where you are now. The mysterious

322
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:13,520
rainbow island. So, recap. A mysterious boat takes you to a mysterious island and I receive

323
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:20,720
a mysterious code from a mysterious island. It all seems quite curious. Not mysterious?

324
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:26,000
Well, I've got work to do and you'd best get exploring. Oh, I almost forgot. Take this home

325
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:30,960
portal. It should make the early stages of your journey easier. Blueprint no phone for a fabric

326
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:39,280
here. Yellow return home portal. Take care, Beatrix. We'll be in touch. Oh my. Okay. Right. Let's

327
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:47,200
put all this money away. Money, money, money. Unfortunately, my inventory is very motherfucking

328
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:55,360
full right now and I'm a bit at the mercy of I don't know what it takes to upgrade it. I'm going

329
00:39:55,360 --> 00:40:02,560
under the lab to see what it takes to upgrade. I assume the Neckos are just going to go flying out.

330
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:08,640
Although I was saying that I can put the roof on top now. Hold on. Air net. It takes a beating

331
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:15,520
but it'll come back. I mean, I swear if they all escape then I'm not going to be very pleased to

332
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:23,680
be honest. Oh for fuck's sake. So what? They're going to break it instantly and I'll go flying out.

333
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:42,400
So what? I'm supposed to do high walls with them as well. 260. I've no got 260 quid. No, I've no.

334
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:47,360
And there's new veggies. So what was that all about? Making me need to turn that down.

335
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:49,200
Right, fuck it. We'll go this way. We're not being this way.

336
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:56,640
You're gonna have to reinstall it. It is a very chill casual game. Press F to activate the den.

337
00:40:56,640 --> 00:41:00,640
The dark damp mushroom covered expansion of the conservatory is a refuge

338
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:08,800
from the sun for slings and ranchers alike. Bye. What in the capitalism is going on here?

339
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:15,760
That would do me. Let's go to the front of the island then. Let me guess.

340
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:22,800
Paywall. You know what? And what? The third time Lucky's also a paywall? No, it can't be

341
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:31,920
because I threw a slime off the map. A rude one. Hello. Okay, there's a chickadee. You're done.

342
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:40,320
You're done getting absolutely done, Zo. Right, if these slime ones eat in hen, eat and eat.

343
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:51,120
Oh, no, I don't want to. No. You must be able to sell slimes as well for monetary value, but hello.

344
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:59,760
Name books. Name books. Name books. Right, I'm going under and I'm going to see.

345
00:42:01,120 --> 00:42:05,520
Are you dead yet or do you still alive? No, you're surprisingly still alive.

346
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:12,080
We'll keep it that way. Where's the underground path? To the left. Only the poop. Okay.

347
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:17,040
You can sell their poop, but you cannot sell their food in.

348
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:21,920
You got some bunnies in with your pink. I know, I'm just letting them.

349
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:27,200
Right, Fabricated Legit Crafter. Yes, I don't have anything though.

350
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:32,480
No, that doesn't make sense. I don't have anything. Warp tech couldn't be less of a

351
00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:37,440
shape. Decorations can be less of a shape. I want upgrades. Don't need more health.

352
00:42:42,080 --> 00:42:46,400
What does that mean? A jet pack of tank goes to improve nano storage

353
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:52,000
sellers in the back of the whole third unit, so wherever you can suck up. But what about like more?

354
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:56,720
That's an extra general purpose tank. Right, but I don't have anything.

355
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:08,160
Mm-hmm. That's right. Mommy's a bit too dumb to understand what the fuck the game wants from her right now.

356
00:43:09,120 --> 00:43:17,520
The refinery. Yay. What is this? What do you do? In order to fabricate gadgets, you'll need to shoot

357
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:21,440
some resources into the refinery, but remember, and then you've already got rid of the thing,

358
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:28,320
but remember what? Come back. No. Come back, bruv. I'm ready to strip off and just take the pictures

359
00:43:28,320 --> 00:43:31,520
and put it on my alt footer right now because I don't know what I'm doing. I feel embarrassed.

360
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:38,480
I don't know what I'm doing. What do you mean? Play the game for the first time? At least the

361
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:49,040
gameplay. That's kind of mildly bad and not optimized. I'm going to say I'm not going to make it. Right,

362
00:43:49,040 --> 00:43:58,800
okay. We need more money. And to obtain money, we must feed. We must go into our architect

363
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:04,800
poll. And to be honest, the first one also kind of threw a ton of stuff at you at once.

364
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:11,440
I just need money. Right. I'm going to get carrots. Okay. It looks like all the field resources

365
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:19,360
have spawned back in. So let us pray that we can make enough money to do what we need to do.

366
00:44:20,080 --> 00:44:26,240
Copium. I'm grinding for the poop. No, the ink! Don't call it poopy!

367
00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:32,240
I feed you food and you ink. I'm an architect. I don't care. You can make fun of it.

368
00:44:32,240 --> 00:44:37,120
Make all the fun you want about it. Who's the one that gets off to a takeaway?

369
00:44:41,360 --> 00:44:47,040
You need to like stick your leg in a bear trap just to fucking ink. Me? A bit of takeaway.

370
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:54,640
Wait, why aren't you going in that one? No, don't. No, I don't want that.

371
00:44:56,720 --> 00:45:00,320
Yeah. You're not shaming me this time.

372
00:45:05,120 --> 00:45:07,520
What was that noise? Your shirt.

373
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:15,920
Right. That's a lot of... I think they're just eating the absolute living daylight.

374
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:25,040
Everything. Right. Let's head back. Mummy. Yeah. You think I added those at most for no reason?

375
00:45:25,040 --> 00:45:30,640
Let me feed you. Okay. Sounded like Link's here. Honestly. I heard that too. I was like...

376
00:45:32,560 --> 00:45:37,280
Right. I have 20 carrots. Surely that's like 500 bucks and then we can do the

377
00:45:37,280 --> 00:45:44,000
Neckle Tank at least. Even though the Slimes are just doing whatever the fuck they want.

378
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:51,520
Right. For the well-behaved rabbits, guess what? They get food. No, no, no, no. You wanted to jump

379
00:45:51,520 --> 00:45:57,840
out your re-cage so much. The well-behaved ones get in there. They get fed. No, no. You all wanted

380
00:45:57,840 --> 00:46:04,400
to jump out. Now you have to face the actions of your consequences. Hold on a minute. I said that

381
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:08,320
the wrong way around. But you know what I meant. You know what I meant. You know what I meant.

382
00:46:08,720 --> 00:46:16,000
No, no, no, no, no. You're not allowed to ask me for forgiveness. No, no. It was too late.

383
00:46:17,120 --> 00:46:23,680
I had a burger today. Good. Was it greasy? Was it full of fat? Sugar? All the bad stuff?

384
00:46:25,840 --> 00:46:35,840
Okay. 450. Surely that's enough for a fucking Neckle Pen. Right. A new pen. Put the Neckles in it. Yes.

385
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:41,840
Neckles. In you go. Do not jump out. I do not have the money for you to jump out. Do you understand?

386
00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:47,840
To comprehende. Oui. Right. And then chickens are next. Right. Chickens are next. Chickens are next.

387
00:46:48,880 --> 00:46:54,240
Chickens are next. We will harvest the chickens and put them in a wee pen.

388
00:46:56,960 --> 00:47:00,640
Okay. And then we're going to pick up these. We need 250.

389
00:47:01,600 --> 00:47:08,720
Okay. Is that everyone inked? Is everyone inked up? Right. Everyone inked up. Everyone's empty and happy.

390
00:47:10,480 --> 00:47:16,400
Did Anna just put all these in one go? Right. Fucking how did you get out? How are you already

391
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:22,480
there? I was literally freaking two seconds ago. I'll put you in. Right. Chicken.

392
00:47:22,640 --> 00:47:26,560
Why do you look so cute though?

393
00:47:29,360 --> 00:47:34,800
Why do you look so cute? Right. I'm going to put the chicken next to the cat. Okay.

394
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:41,280
And the reason for that is they'll see the prey is right there. Okay. And then we're

395
00:47:41,280 --> 00:47:51,120
hashtag winning. Right. Now we need... Okay. Surprisingly, this hasn't grown yet. I think

396
00:47:51,200 --> 00:47:56,400
we're going to need a few more plots of food because it's taken so long to grow.

397
00:47:57,440 --> 00:48:01,920
Chat, we need to explain the market to Mummy. There's a market. I played and beat the first one.

398
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:10,960
How's the sequel? It's going... I mean, it's all right. I'm just not very smart. I'm just going

399
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:18,240
to keep adventuring further this time. Hello little flies. The market is where you sell the plot.

400
00:48:18,640 --> 00:48:26,560
Yeah. The big machine that I throw them into. No, these are my carrots. I need them for my...

401
00:48:27,760 --> 00:48:33,120
Oh, sorry. You can't like open the map and keep going. I think it was telling me going through.

402
00:48:35,200 --> 00:48:39,280
Nope. It was not telling me go this way. Oh, that was me trying to take a shortcut that failed.

403
00:48:40,080 --> 00:48:44,960
You need to understand where you can and cannot sell the plot. Soon. Soon.

404
00:48:45,920 --> 00:48:51,920
It is my first playthrough. So if you're getting frustrated, guess what? I will make it up to you

405
00:48:51,920 --> 00:48:59,360
very shortly. Hello. Press S to activate. I have already activated that. Uh, map. Take a little to

406
00:48:59,360 --> 00:49:05,600
the right and then just keep pressing W. Got it. Oh, chicken. I need you to come with me.

407
00:49:06,320 --> 00:49:12,400
Or not, I guess. No, stop asking me about the freaking refinery. I was so in over my head

408
00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:17,360
when I first started here. I remember hauling jelly stones back to the conservatory by hand

409
00:49:17,360 --> 00:49:21,680
because I was so excited. Breathless and sweating. I was going about everything all wrong, but I was

410
00:49:21,680 --> 00:49:26,640
happy. There's a lot of time now. So I need to... these refineries, like, if I'm going to be efficient

411
00:49:26,640 --> 00:49:32,560
this time, I'm going to do it right. Okay. Oh, the bumblebees take it away. Right. Okay, we're going

412
00:49:32,560 --> 00:49:43,360
to the cavern. And then we'll see what's up ahead. No, baby. Jump, jump, jump, jump.

413
00:49:46,960 --> 00:49:51,600
Okay. Water, water upgrade I don't have. Chicken, you're coming with me. Chicken,

414
00:49:51,600 --> 00:49:55,600
you're coming with me. Chicken, you're coming with me because I've got a chicken pen for you.

415
00:49:56,560 --> 00:49:58,080
Can chickens die?

416
00:50:00,640 --> 00:50:09,840
Wait, what? Isn't there not more? There is more. I need to go up. Up and along. Right, up and along,

417
00:50:09,840 --> 00:50:18,000
up and along, up and along, up and along. Yes, chickens get old and will pass away.

418
00:50:18,080 --> 00:50:24,960
That's not very nice. Wait, is this not on a continuation?

419
00:50:29,200 --> 00:50:30,640
Ain't a lie. How'd I get up there?

420
00:50:33,120 --> 00:50:36,160
Is there a pathway or am I just making stuff up? It's very plausible.

421
00:50:36,880 --> 00:50:41,680
That I could be just making stuff up. Oh, this is a dead end.

422
00:50:42,480 --> 00:50:53,760
Oh, okay. Oh, it's a jetpack jump. No, it means to progress. I already have to do upgrades.

423
00:50:53,760 --> 00:51:00,960
Oh, whoa, it's me. Whoa, it's me. Wait, why aren't you coming?

424
00:51:01,360 --> 00:51:07,760
God, my gun needs an upgrade already? I suck. The cube berries?

425
00:51:09,520 --> 00:51:11,520
Have I been here? Kind of.

426
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:22,960
More chickens, I'll take them. A stone hen? I've only just unlocked enough. No, I don't want,

427
00:51:22,960 --> 00:51:32,640
I want the gems. No, the gems. They must eat these cube berries. That's fine. I'll, I'll

428
00:51:32,640 --> 00:51:45,200
love it. I'll love it. Stony hen. Oh, actually, stony hen. They're like, push their heads together,

429
00:51:45,200 --> 00:51:51,600
like honk, honk. Someone's making noises. Someone's making noises. I don't know who it is,

430
00:51:51,600 --> 00:52:03,520
it's one of my fucking minions. Hmm. Hmm, they're down here. Can you like, jump up on something

431
00:52:03,520 --> 00:52:16,080
to get it? Nope. Right, right. I'm in a listen. Did we go there?

432
00:52:16,240 --> 00:52:23,360
Right, we'll try and go here next and see what the Helio is like there.

433
00:52:24,720 --> 00:52:31,600
And then we will unlock the secret. Oh, will someone please think about the secrets of the map?

434
00:52:31,600 --> 00:52:36,720
Right, no. Take a right and then tickle that.

435
00:52:36,960 --> 00:52:48,480
And then, yeah, right, do a U-turn. U-turn when? U-turn now? Right, if you say refinery link,

436
00:52:51,600 --> 00:53:02,800
I'm off. They're so nasty. I wonder if I help them become good again. I could see myself doing that.

437
00:53:03,760 --> 00:53:09,200
Are they chasing me? Right, they better not be. I'm out. I'm out. Yeah, that's right,

438
00:53:09,200 --> 00:53:15,920
you put that relaxing classical music back on. I wish, so you press M to open up the map,

439
00:53:15,920 --> 00:53:20,080
but when you press M, it doesn't close it again automatically. Is it like a tab? Like,

440
00:53:20,160 --> 00:53:23,600
there's no map feature like that. Right, what was over there?

441
00:53:27,680 --> 00:53:30,960
What is this? A little to the right?

442
00:53:34,240 --> 00:53:37,680
Honestly, it's probably a lot more beneficial to pick up all this

443
00:53:38,960 --> 00:53:45,920
than it is to have one random chain. Is this another backpack thing? No. Right, I made it.

444
00:53:45,920 --> 00:53:51,920
We're at a new location. It only took me, oh, I swear to God, that looks like a backpack thing.

445
00:53:54,880 --> 00:53:56,320
Press F to activate. Okay.

446
00:54:00,240 --> 00:54:06,320
Okay, jump. It's a dead end cavern.

447
00:54:06,480 --> 00:54:14,720
Oh, something came out of it. What car is? Interesting.

448
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:25,280
The towers are too evil for redemption. Oh, no. I like when, like, obviously in Viva Pinyata,

449
00:54:25,280 --> 00:54:28,640
you have like evil Pinyatas, but they're not evil. They just really want stuff.

450
00:54:29,360 --> 00:54:33,680
And then when they get it, they become like nice little Pinyatas and they're so cute.

451
00:54:34,400 --> 00:54:39,520
Like, I love a good redemption art. You know me. I'm all about the redemption.

452
00:54:43,920 --> 00:54:47,440
That first. Right, so they can't break out, which is good.

453
00:54:49,440 --> 00:54:56,480
Oh, sorry. Right, I'll give you these. And then I'll put these checking away over here

454
00:54:57,280 --> 00:55:00,880
to taunt the neckos. I'll put the chicken here.

455
00:55:04,480 --> 00:55:09,360
And then I don't know what I need to feed chickens. Maybe carrot? I mean, if I was a

456
00:55:09,360 --> 00:55:19,840
chicken, I'd eat carrot. Oh, it's 38 for the necko poop. Do you mind? Can you stop?

457
00:55:19,840 --> 00:55:22,800
How are you getting out? You're not coming out when I'm here?

458
00:55:23,600 --> 00:55:25,760
Oh, look at them. They're all interested in the chicken.

459
00:55:27,360 --> 00:55:28,960
Wait, can you jump in and hurt them?

460
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:38,240
You just need a external food. Oh, how is there so many of you out?

461
00:55:42,400 --> 00:55:44,400
You guys are so big over here.

462
00:55:44,720 --> 00:55:55,680
I guess that's what I'm supposed to do to the end. Stop eating the fucking stop.

463
00:55:55,680 --> 00:56:01,360
There's so many big ones. I don't, I don't need your big. I need you to farm.

464
00:56:04,160 --> 00:56:10,720
This game isn't, isn't, isn't relaxed at all. I like, please, I just need more money.

465
00:56:10,720 --> 00:56:17,440
It's making me turn into, no, don't eat the carrots. Those are for me.

466
00:56:19,440 --> 00:56:21,680
Danny put a wall around the farm.

467
00:56:24,560 --> 00:56:30,000
A sprinkler system, a scare slime, a scare, to deter wandering slimes away.

468
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:38,880
No way. I need to put a scarecrow down. Stop eating. No.

469
00:56:41,360 --> 00:56:44,960
You're naughty. You're naughty. You shouldn't do that.

470
00:56:47,200 --> 00:56:51,120
I'm completely messing this up. Hi, how are you doing?

471
00:56:53,200 --> 00:56:55,920
I'm hungry. Stress and exploitation.

472
00:56:55,920 --> 00:57:02,320
Literally, what role am I playing this fucking, how are you here? Go out of the pen.

473
00:57:02,320 --> 00:57:08,000
I have no basic rabbits left to feed fucking corn. This isn't corn, this is carrot.

474
00:57:10,720 --> 00:57:16,160
I literally, is that cat? No. You're the problem. Get out of here.

475
00:57:19,120 --> 00:57:26,800
Please, please stop turning my carrot slimes into the freaking, wait, out and out. Get out of my

476
00:57:26,800 --> 00:57:37,120
freaking suction. Stop it. Right. I suck at this game. It's cute though, but I suck at it.

477
00:57:37,200 --> 00:57:41,120
Right, give me the carrot. Oh, he's eating him.

478
00:57:45,600 --> 00:57:50,400
Oh my gosh, this is going terribly. This couldn't have gone any worse if I just

479
00:57:50,400 --> 00:57:56,080
had planned it to. Can you guys stay in your pen and then can you get the fuck out of the pen?

480
00:57:57,040 --> 00:58:01,840
Why are the big ones so interested in the wee ones? Go away. You've already transformed.

481
00:58:02,800 --> 00:58:19,600
It's not clicking. No, out. Out. I need money. I need money to do it. Stop. Stop. Stop it.

482
00:58:20,480 --> 00:58:22,160
Is they're all in her breeding?

483
00:58:26,960 --> 00:58:34,400
You don't suck at this. Rain, muddy, dreary, cozy, wonderful? What?

484
00:58:35,760 --> 00:58:40,000
Whether light drizzle downpour rain can make any corner of the, a little more dramatic,

485
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:46,080
but rain can also keep tar at bay. Naturally, water, wild fruit and veg and crops and delight

486
00:58:46,080 --> 00:59:00,080
puddles. Right, we're going to take the carrots to the rabbit one that was stuck in the ground.

487
00:59:02,240 --> 00:59:09,040
I'm going to just take the L on this. Where was the carrot one here? We're going to try and get

488
00:59:09,040 --> 00:59:20,320
whatever's behind him. Copey, I'm surely six more. Carrots will be fine, right? Right? Give me the carrots.

489
00:59:23,280 --> 00:59:30,000
New carrots to the warty harvest with them. Right, there's a cute one nearby in a cavern

490
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:34,400
here, but I don't know. Oh, nope, not grown yet.

491
00:59:40,560 --> 00:59:42,800
Little to the left, a little to the left.

492
00:59:52,720 --> 00:59:58,880
I definitely, I think this is more of a game you play, like, silently to yourself. For a stream game,

493
00:59:58,880 --> 01:00:03,680
I am not entertaining enough to make this, like, si-hi-egg thing so fun.

494
01:00:05,680 --> 01:00:09,440
I'm not that kind of streamer, okay? Right, a little, I've gone too far now.

495
01:00:11,840 --> 01:00:16,720
And here, hello? Are you up here, Mr. Rabbit? Okay, here you are.

496
01:00:18,320 --> 01:00:20,880
Oh, hold on, let me grab these just before someone else's.

497
01:00:21,040 --> 01:00:25,760
Abing, aboom, abing, aboom, aboom, aboom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.

498
01:00:25,760 --> 01:00:27,280
Twenty wasn't enough?

499
01:00:33,600 --> 01:00:34,880
Are you serious?

500
01:00:41,280 --> 01:00:42,400
Twenty wasn't enough?

501
01:00:42,560 --> 01:00:53,200
Oh, sorry, I thought that was a carrot. Wait, did I not have a carrot?

502
01:00:55,680 --> 01:00:59,520
Did you eat that fucking carrot? No, I need this one carrot, fuck off.

503
01:01:00,640 --> 01:01:03,440
I need this one carrot. That makes twenty, right?

504
01:01:04,400 --> 01:01:04,880
Huh?

505
01:01:10,800 --> 01:01:15,680
It doesn't explode? Does it just respawn more rabbits? Is that all it does?

506
01:01:18,800 --> 01:01:20,080
It just respawns more?

507
01:01:22,720 --> 01:01:26,560
Uh, he's about to bust just a few more carrots. Shit.

508
01:01:27,680 --> 01:01:30,400
Uh, carrots, carrots, carrots, carrots.

509
01:01:31,200 --> 01:01:39,200
Bust, busting, he's about to bust.

510
01:01:42,640 --> 01:01:45,920
Or you, you're a carrot? He's bustin'.

511
01:01:47,200 --> 01:01:51,520
Are you about to bust? Me every stream.

512
01:01:52,880 --> 01:01:54,240
Uh, one?

513
01:01:55,120 --> 01:02:04,080
How much do you require? Oh, I'm off to find more carrot, then.

514
01:02:09,120 --> 01:02:12,080
At least I can sell all the rabbit little thingamabobbers.

515
01:02:16,080 --> 01:02:19,840
Right, if you tell me about the refinery link one more freaking time,

516
01:02:20,400 --> 01:02:25,200
uh, I'm gonna shit on your motherfucking lawn.

517
01:02:26,960 --> 01:02:29,680
Right, there's a tar, but there's carrots here, so.

518
01:02:31,760 --> 01:02:37,120
Sorry, priorities, priorities, I need carrots. Sorry, I really focus on getting more carrots

519
01:02:37,120 --> 01:02:43,520
right now. I am not going back to that thing. I, I, it needs to pop, okay? It needs to pop.

520
01:02:45,120 --> 01:02:48,960
I need carrot. I need carrot. Yes, I do. I need carrot. How about you?

521
01:02:50,800 --> 01:02:53,600
Eminent death, keep it out. Right, you can come with me.

522
01:02:54,880 --> 01:02:57,600
I can't jet pack. I need jet pack, so.

523
01:03:01,600 --> 01:03:06,240
Leaving them to their fate. Did they just, did they go to slime heaven?

524
01:03:10,640 --> 01:03:16,160
I'm pretty sure that's like way more expensive than, uh, the pink one.

525
01:03:17,120 --> 01:03:23,600
Where, I think that's all the carrot on the map I can obtain right now.

526
01:03:25,840 --> 01:03:29,040
So, unless, unless, unless, unless.

527
01:03:31,760 --> 01:03:34,720
No, stop eating, stop eating, these are mine, these are mine.

528
01:03:35,760 --> 01:03:42,160
I'm taking away the natural resources to benefit my own desires.

529
01:03:42,960 --> 01:03:44,480
Give me them natural resources.

530
01:03:45,520 --> 01:03:49,120
Give me the resources. Right, now to find the rabbit again. Where is it?

531
01:03:49,120 --> 01:03:52,800
He's a little to the right. Okay, up the hill to the right, up the hill to the right, up the hill to the right.

532
01:03:56,240 --> 01:03:58,960
Up the hill. Surely.

533
01:04:05,280 --> 01:04:06,960
Bon appetit. Then what's there?

534
01:04:06,960 --> 01:04:17,440
A, a mineral. Oh, that's how you even, no, wait, what?

535
01:04:18,800 --> 01:04:22,000
Is there something special at the end of this? There better be something special.

536
01:04:23,040 --> 01:04:24,880
What did you press S to activate?

537
01:04:27,280 --> 01:04:28,000
Excuse me?

538
01:04:28,960 --> 01:04:41,040
Ah, what the fuck? All right, let's go investigate that bad boy.

539
01:04:43,360 --> 01:04:45,200
Let's go investigate that.

540
01:04:48,640 --> 01:04:51,120
Pregnant, Pregnanto.

541
01:04:52,640 --> 01:04:54,320
I like how you take no full damage.

542
01:04:55,200 --> 01:04:58,640
Look how big they are because they ate all of the bunny's poop.

543
01:04:59,840 --> 01:05:01,120
What way was it? Is it this way?

544
01:05:03,120 --> 01:05:04,480
Ah, it is this way. Let's go.

545
01:05:16,960 --> 01:05:21,360
Right, wait, what? Is this not what I was looking at? Was I not looking at this?

546
01:05:24,400 --> 01:05:36,960
Oh, wait, what did I just do? This? There's something. Oh, okay, okay, okay, okay.

547
01:05:39,120 --> 01:05:43,600
All right, all right, all right, desolate, desolate. I understand. I'm a bit confuzzled,

548
01:05:43,600 --> 01:05:46,080
but I did unlock something. Right, just go dead ahead if you can.

549
01:05:50,400 --> 01:05:53,440
I'm a bit confuzzled, but I've got the spirit. That's the main thing.

550
01:05:54,960 --> 01:05:58,160
I believe I mean quest appear, but I'm not sure the same was a big enough.

551
01:06:00,960 --> 01:06:05,360
This, right? Okay, okay, hold on, something's happening.

552
01:06:05,360 --> 01:06:07,840
Sorry, I literally went right up to it and then back away.

553
01:06:10,320 --> 01:06:10,880
Uh-huh.

554
01:06:16,240 --> 01:06:19,520
Oh, and where are we?

555
01:06:24,800 --> 01:06:30,960
Okay, I wish I would have told me that. I would have emptied my inventory first,

556
01:06:30,960 --> 01:06:31,920
but you know what, I'll take it.

557
01:06:34,960 --> 01:06:35,920
Let's check it out.

558
01:06:40,960 --> 01:06:47,040
Okay, nothing particularly the ordinary.

559
01:06:47,360 --> 01:06:52,400
Okay, yes, we'll just keep exploring.

560
01:06:54,560 --> 01:06:56,160
Is there lore to the island?

561
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:04,640
This looks very lore-esque. Oh, there's new ones. Hello, where are you?

562
01:07:06,240 --> 01:07:09,280
A roco slime. I guess the only rock chicken.

563
01:07:11,920 --> 01:07:14,480
Yeah, yeah, I bet they do.

564
01:07:15,440 --> 01:07:17,680
Okay, let's grab the roco slime.

565
01:07:23,440 --> 01:07:25,280
You get slimes everywhere, honestly.

566
01:07:29,280 --> 01:07:30,400
Ow, you hurt me.

567
01:07:33,360 --> 01:07:35,200
Hmm, analyzing, analyzing.

568
01:07:38,640 --> 01:07:41,360
Surely there's more to go, or we already like at the end,

569
01:07:41,360 --> 01:07:42,880
it's like the game's like no further.

570
01:07:42,960 --> 01:07:44,480
Hi.

571
01:07:49,040 --> 01:07:54,560
Keep out death, but like actually keep out death or just Teehee keep out death.

572
01:07:56,400 --> 01:07:58,160
Like video game Teehee.

573
01:07:58,160 --> 01:08:00,560
Oh, they're pissed.

574
01:08:00,560 --> 01:08:02,560
Okay, right, you win. I'm not going in.

575
01:08:03,760 --> 01:08:07,200
No, don't, no, AI get off of me. I'm no longer in the area.

576
01:08:08,480 --> 01:08:10,080
AI get off of me. Am I good?

577
01:08:11,040 --> 01:08:14,640
Oh, oh yeah, Teehee.

578
01:08:14,640 --> 01:08:18,000
I could freaking pop you off the map in a heartbeat.

579
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:19,600
Wait, maybe I can just evade them.

580
01:08:22,800 --> 01:08:25,280
Well, hello there gamers. Oh, we're gaming all right.

581
01:08:26,720 --> 01:08:28,480
Oh, I can't suck them away from me.

582
01:08:29,600 --> 01:08:30,400
Right, okay.

583
01:08:31,680 --> 01:08:34,480
You're new. Oh my gosh, what are you?

584
01:08:37,200 --> 01:08:38,800
Just give me a moment. Hold on real quick.

585
01:08:38,800 --> 01:08:39,920
Just let me get rid of all of you.

586
01:08:42,640 --> 01:08:44,080
I want to grab the new one.

587
01:08:44,880 --> 01:08:45,360
Hello?

588
01:08:47,120 --> 01:08:47,680
Honey?

589
01:08:49,120 --> 01:08:50,160
Honey Slime?

590
01:08:50,800 --> 01:08:52,080
You can come with me.

591
01:08:53,280 --> 01:08:54,160
Come with me.

592
01:08:54,160 --> 01:08:57,680
I'll take you a nice, nice, much nicer place in here.

593
01:08:59,280 --> 01:09:00,560
Hello, Honey Slime.

594
01:09:03,440 --> 01:09:04,480
Cute and honey.

595
01:09:05,840 --> 01:09:06,240
Yeah.

596
01:09:06,240 --> 01:09:09,280
Oh, Angler.

597
01:09:10,160 --> 01:09:11,120
Is it attacking me?

598
01:09:11,680 --> 01:09:13,760
Oh my gosh, it's like flashbang and hold on.

599
01:09:13,760 --> 01:09:15,520
I don't want to get rid of the water cabbage

600
01:09:15,520 --> 01:09:18,160
because I want to grow it.

601
01:09:19,840 --> 01:09:23,280
Oh my gosh, there's so many new ones.

602
01:09:24,080 --> 01:09:25,680
Right, we have enough to breed.

603
01:09:29,280 --> 01:09:29,760
So pretty.

604
01:09:29,760 --> 01:09:30,560
Let me get closer.

605
01:09:30,560 --> 01:09:31,200
Look, in you come.

606
01:09:32,400 --> 01:09:33,920
Oh, they're so pretty.

607
01:09:34,480 --> 01:09:37,600
There's like big ones.

608
01:09:39,440 --> 01:09:40,960
Okay, this should do me.

609
01:09:40,960 --> 01:09:45,200
I'm going to head back with my newfound Slime.

610
01:09:45,760 --> 01:09:47,120
Oh, there's like a hidden door here.

611
01:09:48,400 --> 01:09:50,000
Right, hide ahead back that way.

612
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:51,600
The way, come the way you came.

613
01:09:53,840 --> 01:09:55,120
Oh, hey, I finally caught a stream.

614
01:09:55,120 --> 01:09:56,480
Hi, sorry.

615
01:09:56,480 --> 01:09:58,160
I've not been doing longer streams

616
01:09:58,160 --> 01:10:00,160
because I'm trying to do some behind the scenes work.

617
01:10:01,120 --> 01:10:03,920
The super secret event is getting wrapped up

618
01:10:04,480 --> 01:10:05,360
very shortly.

619
01:10:05,360 --> 01:10:06,800
So you'll be able to...

620
01:10:06,800 --> 01:10:08,560
I can finally talk about it.

621
01:10:12,240 --> 01:10:14,640
And my body has been failing me,

622
01:10:14,640 --> 01:10:16,800
making me sleep for 13 hours.

623
01:10:16,800 --> 01:10:19,680
And I'm like, well, like, guy, use me.

624
01:10:20,720 --> 01:10:22,640
I'm not going to want to be sleeping for 13 hours.

625
01:10:22,640 --> 01:10:23,920
Do you know how much work I could have got done?

626
01:10:25,600 --> 01:10:27,280
Right, and we'll go back to the teleport,

627
01:10:27,280 --> 01:10:28,640
which that's off the hill.

628
01:10:28,720 --> 01:10:30,160
Oh, that rock is so cute.

629
01:10:31,040 --> 01:10:32,400
Oh, am I to get the...

630
01:10:33,120 --> 01:10:35,360
Am I to get him to come attack me

631
01:10:35,360 --> 01:10:37,920
and like, throw Dan to this rock?

632
01:10:40,800 --> 01:10:41,360
Oh, sorry.

633
01:10:42,480 --> 01:10:43,600
Oh, no, that's a nice one.

634
01:10:43,600 --> 01:10:44,000
Sorry.

635
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:47,920
Oh, there's honey.

636
01:10:47,920 --> 01:10:49,680
I must be able to harvest honey for these.

637
01:10:51,760 --> 01:10:52,480
Are you two in?

638
01:10:53,600 --> 01:10:54,240
Get in here.

639
01:10:56,720 --> 01:10:57,840
No, he is evil.

640
01:10:59,600 --> 01:11:00,320
Is he?

641
01:11:00,320 --> 01:11:01,280
Are you a mean one?

642
01:11:03,280 --> 01:11:03,840
Are you mean?

643
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:08,320
Oh, am I going crazy and they're nice and subdued now?

644
01:11:08,320 --> 01:11:09,920
Do that is something to subduem?

645
01:11:12,400 --> 01:11:13,520
Oh, it must have been a rock

646
01:11:13,520 --> 01:11:14,960
and a good one coming together

647
01:11:14,960 --> 01:11:16,000
and not the mean ones.

648
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:17,760
Okay, that's not the answer.

649
01:11:17,760 --> 01:11:18,240
Sorry.

650
01:11:18,240 --> 01:11:21,360
I thought it was the answer, but it wasn't.

651
01:11:22,560 --> 01:11:24,480
Good sleep means more productivity.

652
01:11:24,480 --> 01:11:24,960
I would...

653
01:11:24,960 --> 01:11:25,920
I think so.

654
01:11:26,560 --> 01:11:27,920
I genuinely think so.

655
01:11:28,800 --> 01:11:32,080
I've swapped the membership stream to a script writing one

656
01:11:32,080 --> 01:11:34,480
because it's been four months now

657
01:11:34,480 --> 01:11:39,360
and I have still yet to send some girls their script.

658
01:11:41,520 --> 01:11:44,960
And I'm like, I'm actually getting a bit embarrassed about it now.

659
01:11:44,960 --> 01:11:47,280
Like, it's all fine being like,

660
01:11:47,280 --> 01:11:48,560
Australian stream every day.

661
01:11:48,560 --> 01:11:49,600
It's like, that's understandable.

662
01:11:49,600 --> 01:11:50,240
Have a nice day.

663
01:11:50,800 --> 01:11:52,160
I'm getting embarrassed, okay?

664
01:11:52,160 --> 01:11:54,320
And I'm the one wearing a dog collar right now.

665
01:11:54,320 --> 01:11:55,200
And I'm getting embarrassed.

666
01:11:56,320 --> 01:11:57,760
I don't get embarrassed by that,

667
01:11:57,760 --> 01:12:01,760
but I get embarrassed if I'm making someone wait,

668
01:12:01,760 --> 01:12:04,240
especially when they agree to give me their time.

669
01:12:04,240 --> 01:12:05,440
I just feel like, ooh.

670
01:12:06,480 --> 01:12:07,360
You know, like, ooh.

671
01:12:12,080 --> 01:12:13,280
Purposyden.

672
01:12:13,280 --> 01:12:15,520
No, so Posyden did get her script.

673
01:12:15,520 --> 01:12:17,840
It's Maeve who hasn't had her script yet.

674
01:12:18,960 --> 01:12:23,200
There's one girl, Umi.

675
01:12:23,200 --> 01:12:25,840
I'm like, 99% sure I finished the script.

676
01:12:26,720 --> 01:12:28,320
But I might go on another account.

677
01:12:28,320 --> 01:12:32,000
I might need to send it over before I start up the membership stream.

678
01:12:35,360 --> 01:12:38,720
But like, there's another girl that's friends with Sheebie

679
01:12:38,720 --> 01:12:41,680
that I initiated a conversation with

680
01:12:41,680 --> 01:12:43,280
and then forgot to do the old,

681
01:12:43,280 --> 01:12:45,680
oh, hey, I'm messaging you for a collab.

682
01:12:45,680 --> 01:12:47,600
I'm not just randomly asking you how you're doing

683
01:12:47,600 --> 01:12:48,960
because I don't want to waste your time.

684
01:12:49,600 --> 01:12:52,560
I completely forgot to do the part where, hey, let's not,

685
01:12:52,560 --> 01:12:55,120
don't let me, like, let's not waste your time.

686
01:12:55,120 --> 01:12:56,240
I value your time.

687
01:12:56,800 --> 01:12:59,040
Stop fucking eating the carrots.

688
01:12:59,040 --> 01:13:00,000
I swear.

689
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:00,240
Right.

690
01:13:01,280 --> 01:13:02,880
I need to buy this.

691
01:13:02,880 --> 01:13:03,200
Yes.

692
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:06,080
And because I want to plant this,

693
01:13:06,080 --> 01:13:09,280
because that seems to be so rare that I, like, never have it.

694
01:13:09,280 --> 01:13:10,240
Do you guys eat that?

695
01:13:11,600 --> 01:13:12,720
You don't.

696
01:13:12,720 --> 01:13:13,600
What do you eat?

697
01:13:14,960 --> 01:13:15,840
I don't know what you eat.

698
01:13:16,800 --> 01:13:19,440
Well, if I'm growing up, I don't actually need it.

699
01:13:19,440 --> 01:13:24,080
And then am I going to have enough for another corral?

700
01:13:24,080 --> 01:13:26,640
I'm not because that would have been too easy.

701
01:13:27,760 --> 01:13:28,480
Stop.

702
01:13:28,480 --> 01:13:30,560
Stop spawn camping the carrots.

703
01:13:31,280 --> 01:13:32,640
I see what you're doing.

704
01:13:32,640 --> 01:13:34,400
Stop spawn camping the carrots.

705
01:13:35,680 --> 01:13:38,800
You guys are not even tripping anything for me.

706
01:13:41,200 --> 01:13:42,720
Can you kill one of these?

707
01:13:43,920 --> 01:13:44,400
Neco.

708
01:13:45,280 --> 01:13:47,200
Can you go kill the chickens so I can

709
01:13:48,320 --> 01:13:49,440
add to car?

710
01:13:49,440 --> 01:13:51,520
Your personal promo link is now online.

711
01:13:51,520 --> 01:13:54,160
Stop by for the best deals in the galaxy.

712
01:13:54,160 --> 01:13:55,440
I don't have the mutt.

713
01:13:55,440 --> 01:13:56,880
God, they're so patient.

714
01:14:01,680 --> 01:14:04,480
You ate my chicken.

715
01:14:09,600 --> 01:14:10,880
Are you serious?

716
01:14:17,440 --> 01:14:18,160
Holy shit.

717
01:14:18,160 --> 01:14:19,920
Look how many more I've discovered

718
01:14:19,920 --> 01:14:21,280
because of the rock slime.

719
01:14:22,880 --> 01:14:23,360
Wait.

720
01:14:23,360 --> 01:14:26,000
The money changes every day.

721
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:27,920
Honey slime is 36.

722
01:14:28,560 --> 01:14:32,720
Angler fish slime is 63.

723
01:14:33,840 --> 01:14:34,240
Huh.

724
01:14:38,080 --> 01:14:39,280
Yummy chicken.

725
01:14:39,280 --> 01:14:40,640
No, I never said eat that.

726
01:14:42,640 --> 01:14:43,280
Stop.

727
01:14:44,400 --> 01:14:44,800
Stop.

728
01:14:47,040 --> 01:14:49,360
No, you already know what's about to happen,

729
01:14:49,360 --> 01:14:50,880
accept your fate.

730
01:14:50,880 --> 01:14:52,080
Accept your fate.

731
01:14:52,080 --> 01:14:52,960
Get out of here.

732
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:57,440
Accept your fate.

733
01:14:57,440 --> 01:14:58,320
Where's the other one?

734
01:15:01,040 --> 01:15:01,360
Huh?

735
01:15:02,800 --> 01:15:04,080
Did you just beat it up?

736
01:15:06,960 --> 01:15:08,400
Not the Neco slime.

737
01:15:08,400 --> 01:15:10,560
Did the Neco slime just protect everyone?

738
01:15:15,360 --> 01:15:17,760
Did he just help everyone?

739
01:15:18,480 --> 01:15:20,160
Pronto match.

740
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:26,160
Poli Star provisions is online on the video straight.

741
01:15:28,160 --> 01:15:31,680
Poli Star provisions has everything a rancher could ever need and mower.

742
01:15:31,680 --> 01:15:33,280
Check back for regularly.

743
01:15:33,280 --> 01:15:34,720
Cuckoo Corner is online.

744
01:15:34,720 --> 01:15:37,920
Cuckoo Corner has crazy deals on you and exclusive items.

745
01:15:37,920 --> 01:15:38,960
Wee-haw.

746
01:15:38,960 --> 01:15:40,160
What's Cuckoo Corner?

747
01:15:40,720 --> 01:15:43,040
Hatching new deals when the clock strikes midnight.

748
01:15:44,880 --> 01:15:46,080
A fucking cannon?

749
01:15:47,040 --> 01:15:47,360
Oh.

750
01:15:48,480 --> 01:15:51,840
Oh, if you're struggling, it just like straight up.

751
01:15:52,480 --> 01:15:55,840
And I just straight up.

752
01:15:57,600 --> 01:15:58,240
Thanks.

753
01:15:58,240 --> 01:15:59,280
No, I'll stick here.

754
01:16:05,520 --> 01:16:06,720
These are just stickers?

755
01:16:11,120 --> 01:16:14,240
I thought it was going to be like, do you need to buy fruit here?

756
01:16:14,240 --> 01:16:14,720
Buy it.

757
01:16:16,800 --> 01:16:17,760
I didn't expect that.

758
01:16:19,520 --> 01:16:20,160
Wait, what?

759
01:16:23,040 --> 01:16:24,080
Are you serious?

760
01:16:24,080 --> 01:16:26,080
Don't I have one of these fuckers around?

761
01:16:28,720 --> 01:16:30,160
They finally broke out.

762
01:16:30,160 --> 01:16:31,360
It only took them how long?

763
01:16:32,720 --> 01:16:33,840
What do you even eat?

764
01:16:33,840 --> 01:16:34,960
Just stay in there.

765
01:16:34,960 --> 01:16:35,680
Oh my God.

766
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:42,560
Who's fucking being chill into this game because it's moving?

767
01:16:43,120 --> 01:16:45,120
So now I have limited inventory.

768
01:16:45,120 --> 01:16:47,280
I need to try and feed my rabbits.

769
01:16:47,280 --> 01:16:49,440
They aren't even in my fucking corral.

770
01:16:54,400 --> 01:16:59,280
Give me, give me like a billion carrots right now.

771
01:17:00,960 --> 01:17:01,280
Nope.

772
01:17:01,280 --> 01:17:05,520
They're, I'm not just, I'm not just let them eat.

773
01:17:05,520 --> 01:17:06,800
Just fucking take it.

774
01:17:06,800 --> 01:17:07,520
You win.

775
01:17:08,880 --> 01:17:10,240
You win.

776
01:17:10,240 --> 01:17:11,200
What even are you?

777
01:17:12,160 --> 01:17:15,120
You fucking just eat it.

778
01:17:16,320 --> 01:17:17,040
Yeah.

779
01:17:17,040 --> 01:17:18,080
That's what I thought.

780
01:17:18,080 --> 01:17:19,040
That's what I thought.

781
01:17:21,280 --> 01:17:21,600
Right.

782
01:17:21,600 --> 01:17:23,360
I'm picking up the pink ones.

783
01:17:23,360 --> 01:17:23,600
Right.

784
01:17:23,600 --> 01:17:24,640
I'm selling the pink.

785
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:26,640
Jobby.

786
01:17:26,640 --> 01:17:27,360
No, Inc.

787
01:17:27,360 --> 01:17:28,080
The pink Inc.

788
01:17:28,080 --> 01:17:28,560
Not jobby.

789
01:17:28,560 --> 01:17:30,080
Everyone says jobby in the game.

790
01:17:30,080 --> 01:17:33,040
I'm just picking them all up and I must sell them.

791
01:17:35,440 --> 01:17:36,880
I am rather hardcore.

792
01:17:36,880 --> 01:17:37,280
Thank you.

793
01:17:37,680 --> 01:17:43,280
More like hard in your core.

794
01:17:51,520 --> 01:17:51,760
Right.

795
01:17:51,760 --> 01:17:53,280
I'm losing a little bit, but that's okay.

796
01:17:54,640 --> 01:17:55,280
Nice drawing.

797
01:17:55,280 --> 01:17:56,000
Happy plan.

798
01:17:56,880 --> 01:17:59,440
New tabby is a new exclusive slay.

799
01:17:59,440 --> 01:18:01,120
Literally the tabby killed the enemy.

800
01:18:01,120 --> 01:18:02,720
I'm like, is there any main to further?

801
01:18:04,880 --> 01:18:06,720
Give me these so I can sell them.

802
01:18:07,440 --> 01:18:09,280
If I can free up my inventory.

803
01:18:09,280 --> 01:18:10,560
That's what's happening.

804
01:18:10,560 --> 01:18:12,160
Could they not have given you five?

805
01:18:12,160 --> 01:18:14,400
I feel like four is a little on the low side.

806
01:18:15,840 --> 01:18:17,200
And by a little on the low side,

807
01:18:17,200 --> 01:18:19,440
I'm like, what am I supposed to do with four inventory?

808
01:18:20,160 --> 01:18:21,600
Everyone's jumping about.

809
01:18:21,600 --> 01:18:25,200
Everyone's fucking morphed into these different kinds that I don't want.

810
01:18:26,240 --> 01:18:28,080
They're fucking spawn camp.

811
01:18:28,080 --> 01:18:30,080
Stop spawn camping the carrots.

812
01:18:30,080 --> 01:18:31,120
Oh my gosh.

813
01:18:34,400 --> 01:18:36,640
I don't have enough money to even buy a scarecrow.

814
01:18:37,600 --> 01:18:39,120
Right.

815
01:18:39,120 --> 01:18:41,600
Praying I have enough money for a new closure

816
01:18:41,600 --> 01:18:44,480
so I can put something in the closure

817
01:18:44,480 --> 01:18:49,120
and pray that it doesn't fucking escape.

818
01:18:49,120 --> 01:18:51,200
Like all the other bloody things.

819
01:18:53,600 --> 01:18:54,000
Oh.

820
01:18:55,840 --> 01:18:57,520
Not, not getting here.

821
01:18:59,040 --> 01:19:00,480
Do not start morphing.

822
01:19:00,480 --> 01:19:01,840
I'm going to cry so hard.

823
01:19:01,840 --> 01:19:03,440
I just heard it morph behind me.

824
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:05,840
I'm sure I can upgrade.

825
01:19:06,400 --> 01:19:06,800
No.

826
01:19:07,920 --> 01:19:08,240
Out.

827
01:19:10,640 --> 01:19:11,440
Please.

828
01:19:11,440 --> 01:19:13,040
I'm begging.

829
01:19:14,560 --> 01:19:16,000
Get out of here.

830
01:19:19,200 --> 01:19:19,680
No.

831
01:19:19,680 --> 01:19:21,840
I kept the heat eaten.

832
01:19:24,480 --> 01:19:25,440
Please keep eating.

833
01:19:29,360 --> 01:19:30,720
Don't know why you're so.

834
01:19:30,720 --> 01:19:32,720
As if I didn't milk is every day.

835
01:19:32,720 --> 01:19:33,440
Like I'm sorry.

836
01:19:33,440 --> 01:19:34,240
What's the problem?

837
01:19:34,240 --> 01:19:35,520
Go and get away.

838
01:19:36,880 --> 01:19:38,160
Oh you fucking little shit.

839
01:19:40,400 --> 01:19:43,840
Your poop is not as worthy of that price tag.

840
01:19:43,840 --> 01:19:45,280
That is why I'm trying to.

841
01:19:45,280 --> 01:19:46,000
No.

842
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:47,680
Your poop isn't worth that much.

843
01:19:48,240 --> 01:19:49,520
Please eat someone.

844
01:19:49,520 --> 01:19:51,600
Please get out of here.

845
01:19:52,640 --> 01:19:53,360
Please eat.

846
01:19:54,320 --> 01:19:54,640
Why?

847
01:19:55,600 --> 01:19:56,400
Eat.

848
01:19:56,400 --> 01:19:56,960
Thank you.

849
01:19:58,960 --> 01:19:59,280
Bro.

850
01:20:00,160 --> 01:20:00,880
Can you rob?

851
01:20:00,880 --> 01:20:01,920
Thanks for the tip.

852
01:20:01,920 --> 01:20:02,880
No message though.

853
01:20:03,600 --> 01:20:05,680
You know you can type in that little book.

854
01:20:05,680 --> 01:20:06,080
Okay.

855
01:20:07,120 --> 01:20:08,320
You feel that high strong?

856
01:20:08,320 --> 01:20:09,280
I'm a high reason.

857
01:20:10,320 --> 01:20:13,040
You don't have to but there's an option.

858
01:20:14,240 --> 01:20:14,880
There boom.

859
01:20:16,880 --> 01:20:19,440
The most un-relaxed fucking game I've ever played.

860
01:20:19,440 --> 01:20:20,240
I'm getting annoyed.

861
01:20:20,240 --> 01:20:22,480
I'm like everything's jumping out.

862
01:20:22,480 --> 01:20:24,080
Everything's morphing together.

863
01:20:24,080 --> 01:20:26,080
And yes I comprehend the game mechanic

864
01:20:26,080 --> 01:20:28,240
is I'm supposed to put money in a scarecrow.

865
01:20:28,240 --> 01:20:31,200
I do not have 425 coins for a scarecrow.

866
01:20:33,600 --> 01:20:35,920
And I don't even know who eats blue cabbage.

867
01:20:36,800 --> 01:20:37,840
Is that a rock slime?

868
01:20:37,840 --> 01:20:38,880
Do you eat blue cabbage?

869
01:20:41,680 --> 01:20:42,800
Who eats blue cabbage?

870
01:20:44,960 --> 01:20:45,460
Hi.

871
01:20:47,040 --> 01:20:48,960
No you can send that for free.

872
01:20:48,960 --> 01:20:50,720
Don't give me money for messages.

873
01:20:51,920 --> 01:20:52,800
Don't do it.

874
01:20:53,360 --> 01:20:54,000
Right.

875
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:56,560
The rock slime clearly wasn't the answer.

876
01:20:56,560 --> 01:20:59,760
Who eats fucking wet cabbage?

877
01:20:59,760 --> 01:21:00,960
You eat wet cabbage?

878
01:21:03,200 --> 01:21:04,320
Diet meat.

879
01:21:04,320 --> 01:21:04,720
Right.

880
01:21:04,720 --> 01:21:06,880
Well we're not having you out then.

881
01:21:06,880 --> 01:21:08,240
What is your diet fruit?

882
01:21:08,880 --> 01:21:09,280
Right.

883
01:21:13,280 --> 01:21:14,240
I'm not gonna make it.

884
01:21:14,240 --> 01:21:15,760
Wait I'm already out of plots?

885
01:21:19,360 --> 01:21:19,760
Huh?

886
01:21:21,280 --> 01:21:23,120
Can I not upgrade for more plots?

887
01:21:25,200 --> 01:21:27,840
Rabbits and rock slime will both eat veggies

888
01:21:27,840 --> 01:21:28,960
that's a blue cabbage.

889
01:21:30,400 --> 01:21:31,280
You can look it up.

890
01:21:31,280 --> 01:21:34,080
It's in the compendium.

891
01:21:34,080 --> 01:21:34,960
Oh what is it called?

892
01:21:35,840 --> 01:21:37,120
It's comfy but it looks a bit more...

893
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:40,720
So did I get rid of the lower level slimes

894
01:21:40,720 --> 01:21:42,320
in order to make way for the ones

895
01:21:42,320 --> 01:21:43,520
that have stronger popes?

896
01:21:45,680 --> 01:21:46,400
Cause I mean...

897
01:21:48,480 --> 01:21:50,320
Like we can shove the anglers in here.

898
01:21:54,160 --> 01:21:54,960
Oh oh oh!

899
01:21:56,400 --> 01:21:58,160
Is that what I'm supposed to do?

900
01:21:58,160 --> 01:22:00,160
Want to put him in there to be destroyed?

901
01:22:01,280 --> 01:22:03,600
No.

902
01:22:03,600 --> 01:22:04,240
No.

903
01:22:04,240 --> 01:22:04,720
What?

904
01:22:08,880 --> 01:22:10,560
A min max then?

905
01:22:10,560 --> 01:22:11,840
I thought it was gonna be one of those

906
01:22:11,840 --> 01:22:13,520
games that look cute but it's actually scary.

907
01:22:14,320 --> 01:22:16,160
It's frustrating that's what it is.

908
01:22:16,160 --> 01:22:17,200
It's absolutely awful.

909
01:22:19,280 --> 01:22:19,920
Right so...

910
01:22:21,760 --> 01:22:25,440
Because I know on the other gear that I'm supposed to...

911
01:22:26,240 --> 01:22:27,040
So then what?

912
01:22:27,040 --> 01:22:28,640
Just take out all of these guys?

913
01:22:32,240 --> 01:22:34,320
And then put the rock?

914
01:22:34,320 --> 01:22:36,000
You can't have like infinite form?

915
01:22:38,800 --> 01:22:40,160
A rock slime's a veggie.

916
01:22:40,160 --> 01:22:43,600
Right so then we'll put the veggies for him.

917
01:22:44,480 --> 01:22:44,880
Right?

918
01:22:47,200 --> 01:22:48,960
I'm too like you for this.

919
01:22:48,960 --> 01:22:50,080
I actually am.

920
01:22:55,840 --> 01:22:58,560
I thought you could have like all of them alive at once.

921
01:22:58,560 --> 01:22:59,840
I thought that would have been nice.

922
01:23:01,280 --> 01:23:03,360
Okay they'd definitely be eating that though.

923
01:23:07,520 --> 01:23:08,640
Okay and the problem is...

924
01:23:09,280 --> 01:23:11,680
Yeah we instantly get fucking invaded!

925
01:23:13,200 --> 01:23:14,160
Are you f-

926
01:23:14,160 --> 01:23:14,560
How?

927
01:23:17,920 --> 01:23:20,320
I literally just watched it change before my-

928
01:23:20,320 --> 01:23:21,520
Get the fuck out of here.

929
01:23:25,200 --> 01:23:28,240
Right so I'm supposed to put a thing on the roof.

930
01:23:28,240 --> 01:23:28,720
What?

931
01:23:29,680 --> 01:23:31,360
Are rock slimes evil?

932
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:32,800
Get out of here.

933
01:23:34,560 --> 01:23:35,760
Oh my gosh!

934
01:23:36,800 --> 01:23:37,200
Out!

935
01:23:38,640 --> 01:23:40,560
Are rock slimes fucking evil?

936
01:23:51,360 --> 01:23:51,680
Huh?

937
01:23:54,880 --> 01:23:56,560
They can evilly fight each other.

938
01:23:57,520 --> 01:23:58,400
What?

939
01:23:58,400 --> 01:24:00,640
How did that go so terribly wrong?

940
01:24:03,120 --> 01:24:04,960
Who are you fighting each other?

941
01:24:08,960 --> 01:24:11,440
When you mix three slimes they turn evil?

942
01:24:14,320 --> 01:24:15,920
I only got 24 for that.

943
01:24:21,040 --> 01:24:25,760
Right we're fucking needing to put a fucking roof on there.

944
01:24:27,520 --> 01:24:28,560
Or an ear net.

945
01:24:28,560 --> 01:24:31,280
And I literally am missing the price of one.

946
01:24:33,840 --> 01:24:34,960
Can you please eat that?

947
01:24:37,920 --> 01:24:40,160
Someone is twerking on my head right now.

948
01:24:46,480 --> 01:24:47,680
Can you please eat this?

949
01:24:47,680 --> 01:24:49,920
Like I am begging you to eat that.

950
01:24:49,920 --> 01:24:53,520
I need literally four coins to put a roof on this one.

951
01:24:53,520 --> 01:24:54,960
Or at least put the ceiling off a bit.

952
01:24:56,800 --> 01:24:57,280
Oh!

953
01:25:02,400 --> 01:25:03,680
I'm begging.

954
01:25:09,680 --> 01:25:11,840
We are gonna have so many evil ones.

955
01:25:11,840 --> 01:25:13,280
High walls, bye!

956
01:25:13,280 --> 01:25:15,760
Don't ever fucking come out again.

957
01:25:16,640 --> 01:25:18,560
Get the fuck out.

958
01:25:21,600 --> 01:25:24,480
Unless you are a cute little blue slime.

959
01:25:25,440 --> 01:25:27,760
Stay mother fucking in here.

960
01:25:30,080 --> 01:25:30,640
How are the-

961
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:33,360
I have no anglers.

962
01:25:33,360 --> 01:25:34,080
They're all gone.

963
01:25:34,640 --> 01:25:36,160
This farm is a mess.

964
01:25:37,520 --> 01:25:39,840
This- this isn't even a farm.

965
01:25:39,840 --> 01:25:41,360
This is just chaos.

966
01:25:42,160 --> 01:25:44,400
These are rolling about hurting everyone.

967
01:25:45,040 --> 01:25:45,600
Fuck off!

968
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:51,440
If you're gonna become an evil one at least fucking do it in the ocean.

969
01:25:51,440 --> 01:25:51,920
Jesus.

970
01:25:51,920 --> 01:25:55,760
I don't know what to do.

971
01:25:55,760 --> 01:25:56,800
I don't have any money.

972
01:25:56,800 --> 01:25:57,680
I don't have the stonk.

973
01:25:59,280 --> 01:26:00,720
Please don't shoot them randomly.

974
01:26:00,720 --> 01:26:01,600
They don't despawn.

975
01:26:03,920 --> 01:26:05,040
Mummy, clear your base.

976
01:26:05,040 --> 01:26:06,000
We have guests coming over.

977
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:07,520
Oh, you stream sniping to help me.

978
01:26:07,520 --> 01:26:08,000
Thank god.

979
01:26:09,600 --> 01:26:10,880
All my chickens are dead.

980
01:26:10,880 --> 01:26:13,840
All my nails are pouncing on me.

981
01:26:13,840 --> 01:26:14,480
I don't know why.

982
01:26:17,040 --> 01:26:18,160
Are they just wanting a pet?

983
01:26:19,680 --> 01:26:21,840
Well, here's your two buddies that were missing earlier.

984
01:26:22,720 --> 01:26:24,000
All my chickens are dead.

985
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:24,960
All the tricks are dead.

986
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:26,640
I give up.

987
01:26:28,800 --> 01:26:32,240
I submit I've been defeated yet again by a child to get-

988
01:26:32,240 --> 01:26:34,080
Go fucking the pen!

989
01:26:34,960 --> 01:26:37,360
I don't have money to make the walls higher.

990
01:26:38,640 --> 01:26:41,600
I don't have money to unlock like the next few areas either.

991
01:26:43,760 --> 01:26:45,040
Broken by a child then.

992
01:26:47,440 --> 01:26:50,320
They're hungry and their piss cover tummy's empty.

993
01:26:51,200 --> 01:26:53,360
I don't understand how you're supposed to-

994
01:26:53,360 --> 01:26:55,840
You're only supposed to like farm a few at a time though?

995
01:26:56,640 --> 01:26:59,440
Because I don't have any more plots to put food on.

996
01:27:02,240 --> 01:27:03,760
Are they actually angry at me?

997
01:27:05,520 --> 01:27:06,640
We'll be angry as well.

998
01:27:08,400 --> 01:27:10,400
I think we might have been defeated by this game.

999
01:27:10,400 --> 01:27:13,760
I'm afraid I cannot wholeheartedly recommend it.

1000
01:27:15,440 --> 01:27:19,360
Maybe it's just because if for stream game this really isn't that valuable.

1001
01:27:19,360 --> 01:27:20,560
Well, no.

1002
01:27:20,560 --> 01:27:21,440
Sorry.

1003
01:27:21,440 --> 01:27:22,240
Let me re-

1004
01:27:22,240 --> 01:27:23,440
Let me be clear.

1005
01:27:23,440 --> 01:27:26,080
As if yous are chilling in my lap!

1006
01:27:26,080 --> 01:27:27,120
What is this?

1007
01:27:27,120 --> 01:27:28,080
Is that Kitsune?

1008
01:27:30,480 --> 01:27:32,480
Playtime gets the wiggles out.

1009
01:27:32,480 --> 01:27:33,520
Are you wanting to play?

1010
01:27:35,360 --> 01:27:36,480
Is that what it is?

1011
01:27:38,880 --> 01:27:40,240
I still have so many morphins left.

1012
01:27:40,240 --> 01:27:41,840
Yeah, you aren't supposed to spend all your money at once.

1013
01:27:41,840 --> 01:27:42,720
I'm sorry because I don't agree with you.

1014
01:27:42,720 --> 01:27:43,440
I'm sorry but-

1015
01:27:44,160 --> 01:27:44,240
Hmm.

1016
01:27:49,120 --> 01:27:50,880
Why don't they just say what it is?

1017
01:27:53,040 --> 01:27:54,960
Not utilities, other one.

1018
01:27:54,960 --> 01:27:56,960
No, not that one, the other one, upgrades, yeah.

1019
01:27:58,240 --> 01:28:00,880
Ten, a radiant order, they even have that.

1020
01:28:01,920 --> 01:28:02,800
A pedicor.

1021
01:28:04,640 --> 01:28:05,680
What does it mean?

1022
01:28:06,800 --> 01:28:08,080
Someone came down for this.

1023
01:28:09,440 --> 01:28:11,840
Do you wanna read marshmallows for the next half an hour?

1024
01:28:13,440 --> 01:28:16,040
And I'll tell you about all my secret diabolical plans

1025
01:28:17,700 --> 01:28:21,280
Would you rather do that when we talk about my ace of microlapse there coming up

1026
01:28:27,160 --> 01:28:29,160
Sure

1027
01:28:29,680 --> 01:28:34,280
Can I stop playing this game, please? Yeah, I'm afraid it's not one for me

1028
01:28:34,280 --> 01:28:39,840
I wasn't on the cards. I'll use it for background music. I've got that though. Well, I'll keep it background music

1029
01:28:40,600 --> 01:28:42,600
aim

1030
01:28:44,440 --> 01:28:46,440
a

1031
01:28:47,440 --> 01:28:49,440
Aim

1032
01:28:49,960 --> 01:28:55,840
Sunny you need to force read me marshmallows like it's a chubby bunny challenge. Oh true and real. I remember that one viral

1033
01:28:57,360 --> 01:29:03,480
What was the other one? It was like a you put cinnamon in your mouth and you're supposed to like it's so dry

1034
01:29:03,480 --> 01:29:05,400
Like you're not supposed to do anything with it

1035
01:29:05,400 --> 01:29:06,080
Hold on

1036
01:29:06,080 --> 01:29:12,280
I'm gonna very quickly and get a can of cola and then we'll just read marshmallow as well blab away about all my plans

1037
01:29:12,280 --> 01:29:14,280
I get to leak

1038
01:29:15,080 --> 01:29:17,080
And

1039
01:29:17,560 --> 01:29:21,040
But yeah, sorry for the late start to the stream

1040
01:29:21,240 --> 01:29:26,840
You're going to see very quickly because I'm already gonna pass on to the editors because I don't need to edit that content

1041
01:29:26,840 --> 01:29:33,500
I have a hand some more video coming out where it's just my hands and my beautiful nails you hear their nails

1042
01:29:36,120 --> 01:29:38,120
I'm gonna very quickly get a

1043
01:29:38,800 --> 01:29:40,800
cola and

1044
01:29:42,280 --> 01:29:44,280
I

1045
01:29:48,520 --> 01:29:52,800
Thought I didn't turn it off and I've been wasting the battery in the bathroom the entire time

1046
01:29:54,000 --> 01:29:57,560
Ma thanks for the 10 gifts. I'll be one second

1047
01:30:12,280 --> 01:30:14,280
You

1048
01:30:27,200 --> 01:30:34,240
Right I've got cola and a bit of cheese. This was my first meal with my two biscuits yesterday because I forgot to eat

1049
01:30:34,360 --> 01:30:35,640
Whoopsies

1050
01:30:35,640 --> 01:30:41,480
Thank you again Ma for the 10 gifted membership and congrats to those who caught them with your face. Enjoy them all

1051
01:30:41,560 --> 01:30:44,600
There's more on the way soon TM soon soon TM

1052
01:30:45,600 --> 01:30:49,800
I'll need to see what the update on Icy embers and merches and rope shower

1053
01:30:52,920 --> 01:30:58,640
Affeguard he eat I went to bed and I was like I set my alarm for midnight

1054
01:30:58,640 --> 01:31:01,160
And I'll get up at midnight and do everything and then I woke up

1055
01:31:01,920 --> 01:31:04,880
At like half two I think and I was like, oh shit

1056
01:31:05,320 --> 01:31:08,480
But I still technically did what I needed to do

1057
01:31:08,480 --> 01:31:13,440
And I just need to sink my short. So if you didn't know when you record a short

1058
01:31:14,360 --> 01:31:17,160
you record the audio separately and

1059
01:31:18,920 --> 01:31:20,640
Well, this is how I do it anyway

1060
01:31:20,640 --> 01:31:25,680
You record this audio separately and then you pilot your mech to lip-syncing. Okay?

1061
01:31:26,400 --> 01:31:32,160
What's the first order of business ink yourself? That's that's like rule number one of a reefing

1062
01:31:32,200 --> 01:31:35,080
You can be as shameless as you like you can be

1063
01:31:35,600 --> 01:31:37,600
I was cumbers you like

1064
01:31:38,080 --> 01:31:39,280
and

1065
01:31:39,280 --> 01:31:41,600
But first order of business we ink in this house

1066
01:31:43,440 --> 01:31:45,440
We've come in

1067
01:31:45,640 --> 01:31:53,720
But then what you do is you record an MOV fail of your model your mech lip-syncing to the short

1068
01:31:53,720 --> 01:31:55,720
And then you send off to the editor

1069
01:31:55,880 --> 01:32:01,480
I'm peeling back the curtains. Okay, ink and vomit pretty simple. Yeah, when I'm offline you have to vomit

1070
01:32:02,000 --> 01:32:04,760
Closest I can do is pee myself. That'll do that'll do I

1071
01:32:05,760 --> 01:32:09,880
Mean if we really want to start getting into the debate of a squirt pee

1072
01:32:14,280 --> 01:32:18,320
Yes, so after a my little script writing stream I

1073
01:32:19,760 --> 01:32:22,760
I'm gonna pilot my mech to all the

1074
01:32:23,960 --> 01:32:28,960
Pre-recorded shorts I have which is a living which is a lot for me for a beam

1075
01:32:28,960 --> 01:32:30,960
Oh

1076
01:32:32,480 --> 01:32:38,240
Why did I come into um, I rage quit slime rancher and

1077
01:32:39,320 --> 01:32:43,800
I'm reading marshmallows now, but I'm eating quickly because I forgot to eat yesterday

1078
01:32:49,440 --> 01:32:54,480
Gonna be honest, maybe that weight loss isn't so unbelievable now that I've

1079
01:32:55,440 --> 01:33:00,080
Realized that I go days without eating. I just get so distracted and I don't feel hungry

1080
01:33:01,080 --> 01:33:04,000
Like what happened that made you rage quit. I just suck at the game

1081
01:33:06,160 --> 01:33:08,160
Mmm, I'm just not very good

1082
01:33:10,000 --> 01:33:15,960
My slime rancher is officially the second blink it took me to the fourth month of streaming to quit my second game

1083
01:33:18,520 --> 01:33:22,360
Yeah, I don't know why I don't have hunger queues at the minute. Um, I

1084
01:33:23,040 --> 01:33:25,360
Can't think I'm not that stressed. I mean

1085
01:33:26,320 --> 01:33:29,000
stress is straight like stress is one thing, but

1086
01:33:29,520 --> 01:33:31,760
To not have hunger chews is something else

1087
01:33:32,880 --> 01:33:37,960
And do we need to make sure you eat honestly? Sorry, I'm choking on the cheese string. Can you hear it in my throat?

1088
01:33:39,680 --> 01:33:41,920
Your cheese is in my throat. What are you gonna do about it?

1089
01:33:44,960 --> 01:33:49,720
I'm picked into no, I raged off Pikmin because I killed so many of you at the bridge

1090
01:33:50,720 --> 01:33:52,720
If you

1091
01:33:53,080 --> 01:33:58,440
Didn't get the opportunity to see the Pikmin stream. It was a really fun game. I enjoyed it

1092
01:33:58,800 --> 01:34:04,160
The fucking flamingos. I don't know what I was supposed to do all years drowned at the bridge

1093
01:34:04,160 --> 01:34:07,040
I think we lost like 50 soldiers at a bridge of water. I

1094
01:34:10,400 --> 01:34:12,400
Never want to hear that

1095
01:34:13,000 --> 01:34:17,600
String cheese does slap pretty hard. Literally. I'm stringing it up right now and eating it. I'm watching

1096
01:34:19,760 --> 01:34:21,760
Space Marine 2

1097
01:34:22,080 --> 01:34:28,360
Everyone keeps saying that I'm gonna have to look into everyone keeps saying space marine 2 for a stream snip game. I have and

1098
01:34:30,080 --> 01:34:32,080
Have rock and storm I

1099
01:34:32,840 --> 01:34:38,080
Have a mines of Moria, which I've never played before I'm gonna be playing it with you for the first time

1100
01:34:38,680 --> 01:34:40,680
stream sniping up

1101
01:34:43,120 --> 01:34:47,040
Blues assist drowning pick well clearly not

1102
01:34:47,040 --> 01:34:49,040
I

1103
01:34:49,480 --> 01:34:52,080
Don't think they were supposed to drown on that bridge

1104
01:34:56,400 --> 01:35:01,880
Refresh strongy of the marshmallow. What is your wisdom my today's wisdom is?

1105
01:35:04,240 --> 01:35:06,240
My shoulder

1106
01:35:06,440 --> 01:35:14,060
Remember to eat and sleep when you need to well I got plenty of sleep. I can assure you I got plenty of sleep

1107
01:35:14,760 --> 01:35:16,760
13 hours plus sleep

1108
01:35:17,040 --> 01:35:22,720
Yeah, I didn't expect to sleep that long either, but um, yeah, I just kind of kept snoozing my alarm

1109
01:35:25,400 --> 01:35:27,840
And then have to was when I woke up

1110
01:35:29,240 --> 01:35:33,280
Super excited for the donut on I've been putting in some OT overtime and went

1111
01:35:33,720 --> 01:35:36,880
To Gamble for the funds knock it off reflend

1112
01:35:37,520 --> 01:35:41,940
Knock it off. Did I hear rock and stone? Yeah, we're gonna do

1113
01:35:42,960 --> 01:35:45,560
We're also gonna do left for dead to campaign

1114
01:35:47,160 --> 01:35:50,680
Fantastic, sorry, I'm looking for my blanket, but I don't have it and my legs are cold

1115
01:35:51,480 --> 01:35:53,480
and my legs are cold and

1116
01:35:54,080 --> 01:35:56,600
I'm on my chair

1117
01:35:57,680 --> 01:35:59,840
reading some

1118
01:36:03,680 --> 01:36:08,600
I always wanted to try Pikmin Pikmin is really cute, but I died and then I read quite on it, so

1119
01:36:09,880 --> 01:36:14,960
But yeah, we're doing left for dead to stream step and finish in the campaign together because it was so good

1120
01:36:15,400 --> 01:36:22,280
Did you have any dreams during the 13 hours? No, whenever I sleep long, I never remember any dreams

1121
01:36:23,160 --> 01:36:26,600
At all. Hey, strongy. How are you getting along with the collar?

1122
01:36:27,000 --> 01:36:30,280
It doesn't even feel like I'm wearing it right now. Like it just feels

1123
01:36:31,160 --> 01:36:35,200
Comfortable, it's natural. It was in fact not a joke. Wait, what did I joke about?

1124
01:36:37,640 --> 01:36:39,640
Wait, what did I joke about?

1125
01:36:39,760 --> 01:36:42,520
That I forgot to eat. No, that's very true

1126
01:36:42,520 --> 01:36:47,320
That that cheese string is the first thing I ate since I had to shriek to to

1127
01:36:48,120 --> 01:36:49,960
chicken crimpy

1128
01:36:49,960 --> 01:36:54,280
shapes at the start of the stream yesterday when I was munching I

1129
01:36:55,400 --> 01:36:56,920
Forgot the rope

1130
01:36:56,920 --> 01:37:02,800
I already broke it. Since you tried slime wrench or two, I suggest you want to try more Stardew Valley. Oh

1131
01:37:03,080 --> 01:37:11,720
Thank you very much for your suggestion reflin. I understand Stardew Valley is a very nice and casual game

1132
01:37:12,560 --> 01:37:14,920
That game would be so fucking boring to stream

1133
01:37:14,920 --> 01:37:17,800
I cannot even put into words how boring I would be during that stream

1134
01:37:17,800 --> 01:37:21,840
There are other streamers that are much more capable of playing Stardew Valley

1135
01:37:21,840 --> 01:37:27,400
I am not someone that is that interest and I can make Stardew Valley fun. Okay, I

1136
01:37:28,120 --> 01:37:30,440
Don't I've never finished it

1137
01:37:30,440 --> 01:37:34,520
I've played it for a couple of hours and called it a day and I'm like this isn't a game for me

1138
01:37:34,520 --> 01:37:38,720
I need and you start a little bit more juicy, you know, unless you can stream snipe me in it

1139
01:37:38,720 --> 01:37:41,880
Then there's a whole other kettle of fish, but as it stands

1140
01:37:43,120 --> 01:37:49,620
I believe Azura is playing Stardew Valley so you can watch her VODs on it. She's very

1141
01:37:50,600 --> 01:37:52,600
Interesting have I tried Undertale?

1142
01:37:52,600 --> 01:37:55,840
Yeah, I tried to do a pacifist run and then I got stuck at the fucking fish

1143
01:37:55,960 --> 01:37:59,360
She wouldn't let me go. So in her mechanic

1144
01:37:59,360 --> 01:38:03,800
This is spoilers for Undertale if you want to do a pacifist run in her mechanic

1145
01:38:03,800 --> 01:38:08,080
You have to run away mid fight and she kept catching me and I kept running out of HP

1146
01:38:10,240 --> 01:38:16,040
Eh, I forget that chat can make context if I call. That's what I need you need to like put in brackets

1147
01:38:16,040 --> 01:38:22,440
This is in context of this. Hello, mommy. You playing a slime themed game means slime to girl confirmed for gen 2

1148
01:38:22,680 --> 01:38:25,240
I'm joking. Please don't hurt me. I love you. Yes

1149
01:38:26,440 --> 01:38:30,480
You do love me, don't you? So don't ever ask for slime again

1150
01:38:31,120 --> 01:38:36,640
I'm not gonna sling girl. I've already told you what one of the girls are so do with that what you will

1151
01:38:37,480 --> 01:38:45,720
Have a- Oh, right. I've confirmed one type of girl. I've put a trail on and off for the other kinds of girls

1152
01:38:46,640 --> 01:38:53,400
Whether or not any of yous have picked up one that is the whole Azura Stardew Streams turned into a Yapathon

1153
01:38:53,520 --> 01:38:55,520
Oh, did she not play it? Was she just talking?

1154
01:38:56,200 --> 01:39:00,200
I don't like Stardew that much. I like Rune Factory more. Yeah, Strony Rage put in a slime game

1155
01:39:00,200 --> 01:39:04,280
It seems very in character. Exactly. See that me fling no sleeping

1156
01:39:05,880 --> 01:39:07,880
Hi Strony

1157
01:39:07,960 --> 01:39:14,840
I'm sad I can't say for the stream. No, don't worry. The streamer shite. I have to pull my transition out of my car

1158
01:39:14,840 --> 01:39:20,200
So I just want it. Oh your car is trans congrats. So sorry. Shut the fuck up. That was a pathetic joke

1159
01:39:20,200 --> 01:39:26,040
So I just wanted to say love what you've been doing in your free time if you get the chance to listen to these songs

1160
01:39:26,840 --> 01:39:33,800
Rush by Aira star link-up remix by Neyo and Fabolo. So just a pineapple by Boyle. What?

1161
01:39:34,520 --> 01:39:36,520
What interest in making me choose?

1162
01:39:38,040 --> 01:39:44,600
We can always just make Strony a slime. Absolutely not. I am not spending fucking XY elemental p sending a message to Nari being like

1163
01:39:44,600 --> 01:39:47,000
I got paid this much to turn me in a slime. No

1164
01:39:48,280 --> 01:39:49,960
Not happening

1165
01:39:49,960 --> 01:39:52,520
Strony, how do you always lose things you use daily?

1166
01:39:54,040 --> 01:39:57,720
No, I couldn't find so in order to record in order

1167
01:39:58,360 --> 01:40:00,360
Stop. I don't know. Are you squinting me?

1168
01:40:01,160 --> 01:40:06,440
I promise it'll patch you on the head when you are finished. You need your strength to in call the shots

1169
01:40:06,440 --> 01:40:08,280
I'll make you a deal

1170
01:40:08,280 --> 01:40:10,520
I'll make you a deal from the five minutes

1171
01:40:10,760 --> 01:40:15,880
It'll take me to set up the membership stream after this stream. I will

1172
01:40:16,840 --> 01:40:22,600
And this is scouts honor. I will go make uh, I'll heat up some chicken. How about that?

1173
01:40:24,040 --> 01:40:28,360
How about that? I'll heat up some chicken. I got a chicken parma

1174
01:40:29,080 --> 01:40:29,640
a

1175
01:40:29,640 --> 01:40:31,400
leftover

1176
01:40:31,400 --> 01:40:37,560
It's a Hawaiian chicken parma. It's delicious. Got pineapple and ham on it. I'm gonna heat that up and I'm gonna eat it. Okay

1177
01:40:37,960 --> 01:40:44,280
Checking. Oh, it's delicious chicken parmas are just fucking godlike right hydration check refling

1178
01:40:49,160 --> 01:40:51,640
Ham on it. I mean

1179
01:40:55,240 --> 01:40:57,240
It's stuck in my throat

1180
01:40:58,440 --> 01:41:04,040
Why was that so stuck? I've never heard that before. Oh, it was fighting back. Holy shit

1181
01:41:04,600 --> 01:41:10,200
Ham on me. I made a small guide on how to easily remove steam friends after a stream stipend event

1182
01:41:14,120 --> 01:41:16,760
Go to friends go to manage friends list remove

1183
01:41:17,560 --> 01:41:18,680
friend

1184
01:41:18,680 --> 01:41:21,960
Okay, that looks a lot more efficient than what the heck I was in

1185
01:41:24,200 --> 01:41:26,200
Just shouting a request into the void

1186
01:41:26,280 --> 01:41:32,040
But you got to do some spicy puppy ASMR roleplay your panning makes me feral

1187
01:41:32,040 --> 01:41:38,040
I don't know if one of these words will be all flagged and slapped down. Oh, well, that would be amazing kisses kisses. Oh, yeah

1188
01:41:38,040 --> 01:41:40,040
You like my pan

1189
01:41:41,640 --> 01:41:43,640
refling

1190
01:41:46,040 --> 01:41:49,640
Autistic girlfriend lego win soon. I am

1191
01:41:50,360 --> 01:41:56,840
Waking up before stream two hours before stream so I can start wapping out these like things that I want to do

1192
01:41:57,720 --> 01:42:03,160
Um, as I said, I've finally it took me how long to do the tapping on keychains ASMR

1193
01:42:03,240 --> 01:42:06,600
I've finally done it today and I those key chains arrived like a month ago

1194
01:42:07,560 --> 01:42:13,400
Uh, but the editors are all now in place so I can just throw in my little edits tiki

1195
01:42:15,640 --> 01:42:17,640
Oh

1196
01:42:18,120 --> 01:42:21,720
Hi momet further to all of the talk about being intimidated by you

1197
01:42:21,720 --> 01:42:25,160
It took me a while to openly write as much as I do in chat and interact with you

1198
01:42:25,400 --> 01:42:32,280
I started with feeling like I may say the wrong thing and uh and offend you or worse make you disappointed in you. No

1199
01:42:33,880 --> 01:42:40,280
I'm a brain bleh. You don't have to worry about me even now that I know you how accepting and how much of a degenerate

1200
01:42:41,160 --> 01:42:43,160
me a degenerate

1201
01:42:43,960 --> 01:42:45,960
refling

1202
01:42:46,520 --> 01:42:48,120
Never

1203
01:42:48,120 --> 01:42:50,120
I'll write a little bit just a wee bit

1204
01:42:50,840 --> 01:42:52,840
Uh

1205
01:42:54,440 --> 01:42:59,400
Right, where were you degenerate? Let me find the d word. Uh, I am still worried that I might go too far

1206
01:42:59,480 --> 01:43:05,080
Or don't make it obvious. I'm simply teasing not trying to be mean which something causes me to stay my tongue and remain silent

1207
01:43:05,800 --> 01:43:07,320
um

1208
01:43:07,320 --> 01:43:12,680
Get that booth running through and my tongue isn't soft until your chocolate cavern is clean. What?

1209
01:43:13,000 --> 01:43:15,000
Uh

1210
01:43:15,320 --> 01:43:20,200
Ironically brightens my day when I say make do something that makes you happy my heart gets a warm and fuzzy

1211
01:43:20,520 --> 01:43:21,640
But the opposite is true

1212
01:43:21,640 --> 01:43:24,840
If I think I've upset you my heart dropped so low that I think I've hit rock bottom

1213
01:43:25,240 --> 01:43:30,360
Hope that shed some more light on why some people want to be silent. Love you go bar. I love you too refling

1214
01:43:30,440 --> 01:43:35,560
No, I know people seem to think you're gonna offend me or whatever. I'm like, how can you offend me?

1215
01:43:35,640 --> 01:43:41,240
Please how unless you're just straight up insulting me. How on earth am I supposed gonna take it as a fence?

1216
01:43:42,680 --> 01:43:44,040
I think

1217
01:43:44,040 --> 01:43:49,240
Like if you think about what your majority of your message structure are, let's be honest

1218
01:43:50,360 --> 01:43:52,520
We're being a naughty naughty together, right?

1219
01:43:54,360 --> 01:43:57,160
So I think it would be hard to like unless you're going to be like

1220
01:43:58,200 --> 01:44:02,280
Uh, you're you're 50 kilograms. That's too heavy for me. Like

1221
01:44:02,920 --> 01:44:06,920
You're just so like fat and obese or whatever. It's not like that. I'm like, okay, then

1222
01:44:07,480 --> 01:44:09,000
I'm not sure where that came from

1223
01:44:09,000 --> 01:44:15,000
But like it's really hard to I can't imagine how you can accidentally insult me though

1224
01:44:15,240 --> 01:44:17,800
I think it's conditioning from past streamers

1225
01:44:19,240 --> 01:44:23,240
Let's try this tariel should have never been added to a movie. Hmm

1226
01:44:24,600 --> 01:44:33,720
Right, let's just find that message put user in time out 10 seconds. Okay, right. There we go. Uh, anyway moving on

1227
01:44:34,280 --> 01:44:39,320
Um, really like really have to go now. Thank you for the stream. You liked it. It was shit

1228
01:44:40,440 --> 01:44:42,440
You like the stream

1229
01:44:43,400 --> 01:44:49,560
You like oh, I mean, thank you very much. Have a good day by woman by reflin. You like that

1230
01:44:50,280 --> 01:44:55,400
I'm gonna make sure I redirect into sheepsters. Um, let's see she be caught in the

1231
01:44:57,640 --> 01:45:01,400
What is she be up to what shenanigans is she be up to today?

1232
01:45:02,360 --> 01:45:04,360
She be is

1233
01:45:07,000 --> 01:45:10,280
Not streaming today, so I can't redirect into her

1234
01:45:18,120 --> 01:45:21,480
Okay, so she's not strumming right

1235
01:45:23,800 --> 01:45:29,560
You were struggling in a very funny way to be fair. No, she was she be took us on a field trip earlier on

1236
01:45:31,640 --> 01:45:33,640
cruising on that school bus

1237
01:45:34,040 --> 01:45:35,480
and then

1238
01:45:35,480 --> 01:45:40,440
Emmy's out the game for five more days. So then it would go a zero delay next

1239
01:45:42,040 --> 01:45:44,040
Are she not got her rooms up?

1240
01:45:45,400 --> 01:45:50,840
Hmm, I have a message of zero right now and just feel like hello darling, right? You guys get to listen to

1241
01:45:51,560 --> 01:45:53,880
A real conversation ready. Hello

1246
01:46:12,280 --> 01:46:17,640

1247
01:46:20,200 --> 01:46:25,560
Oh, I thought the hobbit was lord of the rings it is it's um the pre lord of the rings part

1265
01:47:55,480 --> 01:48:03,960
There's no way I can't believe it the girls are working against me. Fuck it. We'll redirect into den for she seems to be up

1268
01:48:17,000 --> 01:48:23,720

1269
01:48:26,280 --> 01:48:29,240
Please tell me she's still streaming. I know you can hear her a little bit in the background

See the work is she going offline? Wait, this is a premiere

1274
01:48:58,200 --> 01:49:00,200
Oh my god, it's not a live stream

1275
01:49:04,280 --> 01:49:10,360
I'm an idiot. It's not a live stream, right? No one's gonna redirect it into them. It's not a live stream

1276
01:49:11,080 --> 01:49:15,560
That's embarrassing. I've closed the tab off. I hope I hope dempa doesn't see that that's embarrassing

1277
01:49:15,800 --> 01:49:19,080
That is absolutely mortifying. Sorry. I'm not fucking

1278
01:49:20,600 --> 01:49:23,320

And you wrote are you even wrote it in chat, bro? I closed that tab so fast. I'm not looking

1282
01:49:42,680 --> 01:49:45,160
I'm not looking. That's not me. You can't prove it

1283
01:49:46,920 --> 01:49:48,920
Um

1284
01:49:52,040 --> 01:49:56,520
Katerina's live did she just go live right? Let me redirect into Katarina. I don't see her

1285
01:50:02,040 --> 01:50:04,040
Oh, she's on the adoption though

1286
01:50:04,040 --> 01:50:08,840
I don't think you're supposed to redirect into collabs because it's like, oh, thank you so much for the video

1287
01:50:09,000 --> 01:50:11,000
Like

1288
01:50:11,720 --> 01:50:16,280
Oh, fuck it. We'll just we'll just no redirect and then we'll maybe know how you can go. Um

01:50:17,480 --> 01:50:20,040
I've got weird error message. Sorry if this is a repeat

1290
01:50:20,200 --> 01:50:24,760
I just remember you said you got a picture of your tear when you left a mark on it. Oh, do you want that?

1291
01:50:25,080 --> 01:50:27,080
I mean if you want to show

1295
01:50:35,240 --> 01:50:37,880
Hi mom, how'd you do my tasteful? That is good

1296
01:50:38,920 --> 01:50:43,960
Love a good tasteful. I don't mean to offend but I want you to suffocate me with your thighs

1297
01:50:46,280 --> 01:50:48,280
Offend I encourage

You want me to watch napoleon dynamite and talladega nights. I've actually seen talladega nights

1299
01:50:56,840 --> 01:50:58,840

Um, I know you said you take inspiration from demper from the ace thing and I also watched the video

1304
01:51:19,320 --> 01:51:21,640
But what is she doing there? I genuinely don't know. I'm a dumb

1305
01:51:23,000 --> 01:51:25,000
She shoved it in her fanny

1306
01:51:25,640 --> 01:51:27,880
I don't know how other way to say that

1307
01:51:29,320 --> 01:51:31,560
Listen to the audio and where do you think she put it?

1308
01:51:34,200 --> 01:51:38,280
Refland I know we share one brain cell, but what do you think happened?

1309
01:51:39,880 --> 01:51:45,000
Why do you think chat does he know does he know? I don't know if refland knows

1310
01:51:46,920 --> 01:51:52,840
Mummy naked dog is up for all the script delays for a win. I don't have clothes for it

1311
01:51:54,200 --> 01:51:58,040
I don't have a yukata to put on the side like I don't have clothes that look like me

1312
01:51:59,640 --> 01:52:01,640
I

1313
01:52:05,880 --> 01:52:08,760
I'll commission the artwork, but I don't think I can actually do it

1314
01:52:09,480 --> 01:52:12,120
Mummy can I get a feel over of kissing on youtube? Yeah

1315
01:52:12,840 --> 01:52:17,160
I might be doing a youtube milestone stream, which is 10 000 kisses

1316
01:52:18,520 --> 01:52:21,480
Are you wanting it already dear bifling?

1317
01:52:22,600 --> 01:52:26,120
You get 10 000 kisses and every burp puts his back by one kiss

1318
01:52:29,400 --> 01:52:33,080
Could just be my biohazard hoodie honestly

1319
01:52:34,120 --> 01:52:39,000
Yes, we tested it in a membership stream. So I it takes me one hour to do

1320
01:52:39,720 --> 01:52:43,000
1 000 kisses, but if I zoom through it like

1321
01:52:44,760 --> 01:52:47,960
So 20k no the 20k celebration is tinga

1322
01:52:49,720 --> 01:52:51,720
I'm doing what ac did

1323
01:52:51,880 --> 01:52:58,520
The 20k celebration is vengabus. Oh wait. No the 20k celebration was the work. It's like 25k celebration

1324
01:52:58,520 --> 01:52:59,960
is vengabus

1325
01:52:59,960 --> 01:53:05,000
And then 30k was gonna be rebecca cosplay, but I can't find um

1326
01:53:06,600 --> 01:53:14,200
A high quality cosplay I want yet. So I might have to stall the rebecca and make it 30k is 10 000 kisses

1327
01:53:14,920 --> 01:53:16,920
the machine gun goes

1328
01:53:19,560 --> 01:53:25,240
Have you ever tried playing the game cassette beats if you like pokemon you might enjoy it. It's different unique take on it

1329
01:53:25,720 --> 01:53:27,720
Hmm

1330
01:53:28,040 --> 01:53:31,640
No 20k kisses because of all the burps putting her back honestly, uh

1331
01:53:32,600 --> 01:53:34,600
Anywhere I can send a pdf

1332
01:53:35,480 --> 01:53:42,360
Uh, you don't have enough characters here to send you our marriage certificate that you need to sign. That's so cute

1333
01:53:43,720 --> 01:53:45,720
I didn't expect that

1334
01:53:45,880 --> 01:53:50,760
You're already being knotted by not eating properly now. You have a color on you have a bark jet bark, but

1335
01:53:52,040 --> 01:53:54,040
I'm not gonna lie. That gave me a pulse

1336
01:53:55,400 --> 01:53:57,400
Uh

1337
01:53:57,720 --> 01:53:59,720
What the fuck

1338
01:54:02,200 --> 01:54:06,360
Monkey that's bad that should not get me so easily

1339
01:54:09,960 --> 01:54:11,960
That that should not get me so easy

1340
01:54:13,080 --> 01:54:19,480
Take care of yourself and in turn the refunds will take care of cooking and tucking me in a bed. Oh, that's so cute

1341
01:54:20,440 --> 01:54:25,080
Mummy how close to the farm would slime rancher be would we be free range?

1342
01:54:25,720 --> 01:54:31,640
Would not even be putting cages. I think if you were naughty, there has to be some form of punishment

1343
01:54:31,640 --> 01:54:34,120
I think like facing would be a good one

1344
01:54:35,480 --> 01:54:38,600
Please breathe quietly or during the member stream

1345
01:54:50,040 --> 01:54:52,040
Oh

1346
01:54:55,160 --> 01:55:01,640
Okay, okay, I understand. Okay. I read it quietly. We need to gift you a headset with poppy ears

1347
01:55:05,160 --> 01:55:07,160
Um, I don't think

1348
01:55:09,400 --> 01:55:15,160
Strani you mentioned maybe doing some pop-up membership script right in streams to get caught up. Yeah, you'll never guess what comes up next

1349
01:55:16,040 --> 01:55:21,880
Um punishment equals no milking. Yeah, you're not allowed to talk to a face

1350
01:55:23,640 --> 01:55:28,120
Uh, the only way I accept death is in between your thighs. Yeah

1351
01:55:29,960 --> 01:55:33,960
Is that a punishment though? Yeah, if I say you're being denoured

1352
01:55:34,760 --> 01:55:36,760
access denied

1353
01:55:37,480 --> 01:55:39,480
Access denied

1354
01:55:39,480 --> 01:55:43,720
Oh, did I say thank you grim baby alert for the trip? I've been really really bad

1355
01:55:44,680 --> 01:55:46,840
Please mommy. Yes, I will right

1356
01:55:47,800 --> 01:55:50,200
we're not gonna redirect into anyone because

1357
01:55:51,080 --> 01:55:57,960
Uh, there's no one a veal or that's fucking online today. I'm about to jump into a membership stream. Um

1358
01:56:00,120 --> 01:56:02,360
And then I'll far

1359
01:56:02,440 --> 01:56:04,440
Uh

1360
01:56:12,520 --> 01:56:18,920
Being denied a doesn't sound you may are you gonna go stream you may go stream right now on youtube so I can redirect into

1361
01:56:19,480 --> 01:56:22,520
Do you stream? Are you on twitch only? I think you're on twitch only, aren't you?

1362
01:56:24,520 --> 01:56:27,320
Oh, you may are you on twitter? Do you stream on youtube?

1363
01:56:28,200 --> 01:56:31,320
Uh, no, you don't stream on youtube get farted on

1364
01:56:34,840 --> 01:56:36,840
I'm needing something to redirect into

1365

But you're not online. I don't stream on youtube. No, you didn't that's right bend over for the spanking

That's right. No, you didn't you didn't you don't know you're not farted on

1367
01:56:49,400 --> 01:56:55,480
Simcasting on twitter news, honestly, right. I'm gonna wrap it up. I do apologize for such a short stream

1368
01:56:55,480 --> 01:57:00,200
I'm afraid that that is the risk we take when I play a game for the first time

1369
01:57:00,520 --> 01:57:03,960
Left or dead to playing it for the first time. Absolute bliss

1370
01:57:05,080 --> 01:57:07,800
Perfection gorgeous 10 out of 10 experience

1371
01:57:08,360 --> 01:57:10,040
slime rancher

1372
01:57:10,040 --> 01:57:16,040
The child's game has defeated me. I admit it. I admit it. I am a shicer gamer. Okay

1373
01:57:17,160 --> 01:57:19,160
um

1374
01:57:19,880 --> 01:57:21,880
You may just got members you're gonna listen and

1375
01:57:22,600 --> 01:57:24,600
Oh fine. I'll bend over

1376
01:57:25,320 --> 01:57:28,840

for some

1379
01:57:33,560 --> 01:57:35,560
Very sus ASMR roleplay

1380
01:57:35,960 --> 01:57:41,000
I'm actually gonna have to change the title to our roleplay because I'm going to be using the smd for it

1381
01:57:41,240 --> 01:57:43,240
This microphone here you hear me hitting you

1382
01:57:44,840 --> 01:57:47,240
That's what this microphone is. It's not ASMR

1383
01:57:47,240 --> 01:57:49,240
So I need to take that out of the title

1384
01:57:49,320 --> 01:57:51,320
But I am doing ASMR hand cam stream

1385
01:57:51,480 --> 01:57:57,240
The girls did swap out their ASMRs because they were a bit worried, but I'm sticking to my guns because

1386
01:57:58,760 --> 01:58:02,760
Yeah, youtube admitted that the rat strike didn't count

1387
01:58:03,320 --> 01:58:05,560
So I'm like, do I need to tell emmy to beg?

1388
01:58:06,200 --> 01:58:12,120
A little a little bit begging begging for a peggling on twitter to remove the other strike now

1389
01:58:13,080 --> 01:58:15,080
Because it seems to be working

1390
01:58:15,720 --> 01:58:17,480
somehow

1391
01:58:17,480 --> 01:58:19,480
Uh, but yes

1392
01:58:19,720 --> 01:58:20,840
Hmm

1393
01:58:20,840 --> 01:58:26,680
Please 18 plus game god gamer, please children games challenge impossible honestly though

1394
01:58:26,680 --> 01:58:30,360
I can't even see my figure out. Like I just can't even get it

1395
01:58:31,560 --> 01:58:33,560
Just doesn't happen

1396
01:58:33,560 --> 01:58:35,560
Rats are not 18 plus real

1397
01:58:36,360 --> 01:58:37,640
um

1398
01:58:37,640 --> 01:58:39,000
Right

1399
01:58:39,000 --> 01:58:41,240

1400
01:58:42,120 --> 01:58:45,560
