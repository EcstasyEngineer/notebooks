I think our patient is waking up. Now you better be gentle with them. Last time you made

00:15.240 --> 00:26.040
the specimens heart rate go to 160 beats per minute which is outrageous. All while they

00:26.040 --> 00:35.800
were lying down made I add. Humans are resilient but not perfect. They have obvious limitations.

00:35.800 --> 00:44.600
You should make better notes when working directly with them. It also lowers aggressiveness

00:44.600 --> 00:54.680
overall. There was that other incident where you resorted to using your tentacles to restrain

00:54.680 --> 01:01.720
them and you were left with a nasty mark for a while until you're newly married to heal it.

01:01.720 --> 01:08.800
No they missed out often but there is a reason I ask you to be a part of this particular humans

01:08.800 --> 01:16.920
induction. In the case report here it says they didn't even resist. Looks like they are a deep

01:16.920 --> 01:27.360
sleeper. Or some kind of insomnia. Or if they do find you get to sleep. It's so deep. They have no clue

01:27.360 --> 01:35.080
what's going on around them. How fascinating. They can't just turn it on like a switch or a timer.

01:35.080 --> 01:42.760
What intricate little things they make for their daily lives. It can't seem to fix themselves.

01:43.400 --> 01:52.520
A shame. Well hopefully they will soon learn our ways are superior. Oh they're awake now.

01:53.800 --> 02:01.720
Hello dear specimen. Please do not pull on the first strange. That is fuel that will just

02:01.720 --> 02:11.080
allow you to your heart rate. Relax. You are safe and in a serialized lab for lack of better words.

02:12.040 --> 02:18.840
We are just running some boring guinea pig test on you and then from there you will be infected

02:18.840 --> 02:27.800
with our virus and back to mingle with your own. Oh don't worry we are testing how rapidly humans

02:27.800 --> 02:35.400
can be infected so if it doesn't go too well it's not like you failed. If anything the results are

02:35.480 --> 02:45.160
very valuable or well they are to us anyway. With a little bit more bedside manners that

02:45.160 --> 02:51.960
wasn't bad I think you will be fined to conduct some of these experiments on your own.

02:53.400 --> 03:00.440
First human we do have to take some samples so that we have a baseline from when you started

03:00.440 --> 03:09.160
and where you are in a month's time. Oh yeah we do have to recapture you but don't worry

03:09.160 --> 03:17.640
you already have a tracker in you. We will be watching over you the whole time almost like an

03:17.640 --> 03:27.240
angel. You humans do love the idea of something watching over you even if they are powerless but

03:27.320 --> 03:40.520
this time well something very strong and powerful is caring for you. Who comforted and

03:40.600 --> 03:46.440
trained you think? Let me just check over you real quickly.

03:53.480 --> 03:57.800
It looks pretty alright to me.

03:57.800 --> 04:15.080
Let me just prepare them for you.

04:15.080 --> 04:32.360
Okay it's time to infect them. This one turned one bit I promise.

04:32.920 --> 04:41.560
Our technology is unsprisingly a lot more advanced than you think. However the side effects are

04:41.560 --> 04:51.960
rather curious. Most humans explain it like a weird lucid dream but it's rather favorable

04:51.960 --> 04:58.280
due to the fact not a single soul will believe you when you explain this experience in detail.

04:58.280 --> 05:07.000
How amazing.
