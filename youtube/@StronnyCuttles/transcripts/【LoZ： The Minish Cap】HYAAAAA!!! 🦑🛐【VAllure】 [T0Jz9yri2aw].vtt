WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:09.000
Wow, there we go.

00:09.000 --> 00:15.000
Fall into your hand, I commend your spirit.

00:15.000 --> 00:18.000
Oh, my God.

00:18.000 --> 00:20.000
Testing, testing.

00:20.000 --> 00:25.000
Uno, dos, tres, cuatro, cinco, cinco, seis.

00:25.000 --> 00:31.000
I know it's kind of hard just to get off one, two, three.

00:31.000 --> 00:33.000
He asked for a thirteen, yeah?

00:33.000 --> 00:37.000
He drew a thirty-one, so he's trying to hard.

00:37.000 --> 00:42.000
Good morning, good evening, good after.

00:42.000 --> 00:44.000
Below the name.

00:44.000 --> 00:45.000
Okay?

00:45.000 --> 00:49.000
I am none other than Shony Culls and I am playing...

00:49.000 --> 00:52.000
It took me a really long time to be able to screen capture

00:52.000 --> 00:55.000
my legitimate Game Boy Advance that I own.

00:55.000 --> 00:57.000
Oh, it's fantastic.

00:57.000 --> 01:00.000
Really, really fantastic technology.

01:00.000 --> 01:03.000
May or may not, I have just softlocked my PC

01:03.000 --> 01:07.000
and that is why I had such trouble getting on fucking line.

01:07.000 --> 01:11.000
But lo and behold, we are here.

01:11.000 --> 01:14.000
I'm just gonna make sure...

01:14.000 --> 01:15.000
Oh.

01:15.000 --> 01:17.000
Okay, so this...

01:17.000 --> 01:19.000
This thing.

01:19.000 --> 01:21.000
Okay, we're good.

01:21.000 --> 01:22.000
This thing.

01:26.000 --> 01:27.000
Oh my god, oh my god.

01:27.000 --> 01:29.000
I should become an opera singer.

01:29.000 --> 01:31.000
I'm that bloody good.

01:31.000 --> 01:32.000
What's that?

01:32.000 --> 01:34.000
I have smoke up my ass.

01:34.000 --> 01:36.000
Okay, my little reeflings.

01:36.000 --> 01:39.000
Today on the agendination.

01:39.000 --> 01:40.000
Are you doing okay?

01:40.000 --> 01:44.000
Yes, I'm farting up a storm, so alcohol definitely makes you fart more,

01:44.000 --> 01:46.000
if you want to know.

01:46.000 --> 01:48.000
Um...

01:48.000 --> 01:50.000
Uh, what's my sentence?

01:50.000 --> 01:53.000
Um, in four hours time,

01:53.000 --> 01:55.000
we're gonna do a membership stream,

01:55.000 --> 01:57.000
which isn't actually up right now.

01:57.000 --> 01:59.000
Cause...

01:59.000 --> 02:03.000
I maybe didn't put it up yet.

02:03.000 --> 02:04.000
Me?

02:04.000 --> 02:06.000
I've been able to get something up?

02:06.000 --> 02:09.000
Impossible, impossible.

02:09.000 --> 02:12.000
Um...

02:12.000 --> 02:14.000
Wait, what's our name in Zelda gonna be then?

02:14.000 --> 02:15.000
Oh, sorry.

02:15.000 --> 02:17.000
The legend of long.

02:17.000 --> 02:18.000
Wait.

02:18.000 --> 02:20.000
Was it AB?

02:20.000 --> 02:21.000
Uh, right.

02:21.000 --> 02:22.000
Ah.

02:25.000 --> 02:28.000
Oh wait, the in-game character is gonna call us Anon.

02:28.000 --> 02:30.000
No, call us Link.

02:30.000 --> 02:31.000
Link.

02:31.000 --> 02:33.000
We came to town.

02:33.000 --> 02:35.000
We came to save.

02:36.000 --> 02:39.000
Uh, yes, we are doing the forbidden tier list ring.

02:39.000 --> 02:43.000
I am gonna need a kind reefling to send me the Link

02:43.000 --> 02:46.000
and marshmallow, cause I actually don't even have the Link.

02:46.000 --> 02:48.000
Uh, cartoffel of doom.

02:48.000 --> 02:50.000
Thank you very much for coming to member.

02:50.000 --> 02:53.000
Yeah, everyone's need to go and show the number.

02:53.000 --> 02:54.000
Oh!

02:54.000 --> 02:56.000
Why would you never?

02:56.000 --> 02:57.000
Save file.

02:57.000 --> 03:01.000
Do not touch the completely legitimate Nintendo.

03:01.000 --> 03:03.000
Wow.

03:03.000 --> 03:05.000
Damn plane.

03:05.000 --> 03:07.000
The controls are a bit wrong, but...

03:07.000 --> 03:08.000
Wah, I'll read it.

03:08.000 --> 03:09.000
Don't worry if you can't read.

03:09.000 --> 03:11.000
I'll read it for you.

03:11.000 --> 03:14.000
A long, long time ago.

03:16.000 --> 03:20.000
When the world was on the verge of being swallowed by shadow.

03:25.000 --> 03:32.000
A tiny picori appeared from the sky, bringing the hero of men a sword and a golden light.

03:32.000 --> 03:36.000
With wisdom and courage, the hero drove out the darkness.

03:42.000 --> 03:47.000
When peace had been restored, the people enshrined that blade with care.

03:55.000 --> 03:57.000
You've never played Minish Cap?

03:57.000 --> 04:01.000
The funny thing is, Minish Cap is the only Zelda game I've actually played.

04:04.000 --> 04:06.000
Look, it's Zelda!

04:06.000 --> 04:08.000
This is what the entire series is named after.

04:08.000 --> 04:11.000
This little pink pixel here.

04:11.000 --> 04:15.000
The entire series is named after her.

04:15.000 --> 04:17.000
Because everyone...

04:17.000 --> 04:21.000
Ah, made the mistake of thinking that Link is called Zelda as well.

04:21.000 --> 04:23.000
Good morning, meh.

04:23.000 --> 04:26.000
Good morning, meh, meh.

04:26.000 --> 04:29.000
Good morning, Princess Zelda.

04:29.000 --> 04:32.000
Did you sneak out of the castle and come all this way alone?

04:32.000 --> 04:35.000
The moon is so sure to be worried about you.

04:35.000 --> 04:37.000
You know how he gets.

04:37.000 --> 04:41.000
Oh, don't worry about him. He'll be fine. Where's Link?

04:41.000 --> 04:47.000
The whole town is bustling for an annual picori festival.

04:47.000 --> 04:50.000
I thought he and I might go together.

04:50.000 --> 04:53.000
Would you mind? Terribly.

04:54.000 --> 04:56.000
Oh, is that what you're here for?

04:56.000 --> 05:00.000
Well, Link was up late helping me last night and he's still asleep.

05:00.000 --> 05:03.000
But I don't have an errand at the castle.

05:03.000 --> 05:06.000
Yes. Oh, but I do have an errand at the castle.

05:06.000 --> 05:08.000
Yes, that should be fine.

05:08.000 --> 05:10.000
Ah, yes, Legend of Zelda.

05:10.000 --> 05:13.000
Kinks of Weakening, Ike, Void Sword...

05:13.000 --> 05:15.000
Void Sword, sure.

05:15.000 --> 05:17.000
Thank you for the tip. I don't think I was going with Void Sword.

05:17.000 --> 05:19.000
But yes, that should be fine, yes.

05:19.000 --> 05:23.000
Link! Time to get up!

05:26.000 --> 05:29.000
Did I see Nintendo Direct today? No.

05:29.000 --> 05:32.000
Link! Link, I said it's time to get up!

05:34.000 --> 05:36.000
Eh?

05:36.000 --> 05:38.000
Man, I was fapping.

05:38.000 --> 05:40.000
Goddamn, got that morning wooden shit.

05:41.000 --> 05:43.000
I just love these pixel games.

05:43.000 --> 05:52.000
Oh my god, did you know in the VTuber community, someone is making a Legend of Zelda inspired like little fucking Cedar game?

05:52.000 --> 05:56.000
Like, you're at a cafe and shit? I'm gonna be all over that stuff.

05:56.000 --> 05:58.000
Hold on, funding it right now.

05:59.000 --> 06:00.000
Huh?

06:01.000 --> 06:04.000
Oh shit, my freaking tea.

06:04.000 --> 06:06.000
Hey, Link!

06:06.000 --> 06:11.000
Princess, then it lies how I should like to know if you'd like to join her at the festival.

06:11.000 --> 06:15.000
Yeah Link, come on, let's go check out the festival together.

06:15.000 --> 06:19.000
Master Sith already gave me permission to take you.

06:19.000 --> 06:22.000
Well, handed off like a dog.

06:22.000 --> 06:27.000
Yes, after all, the festival only comes once a year. God, have fun.

06:27.000 --> 06:30.000
And while you're there, you can do me a favor.

06:30.000 --> 06:35.000
I just finished making the sword for the minister at Hyrule Castle.

06:35.000 --> 06:38.000
I'd like you to deliver it to him.

06:41.000 --> 06:45.000
You, you accepted the sword.

06:45.000 --> 06:49.000
Make sure you don't lose this extremely important delivery. I won't.

06:49.000 --> 06:54.000
This is the blade that will be presented to the winner of the competition.

06:54.000 --> 06:59.000
Don't lose it. And while the two of you may be childhood friends, remember...

06:59.000 --> 07:00.000
Are you?

07:00.000 --> 07:03.000
Remember, Zelda is the princess of Hyrule.

07:03.000 --> 07:07.000
You watch over her, don't let anything bad happen to her.

07:07.000 --> 07:12.000
Master Smith, quit worrying. I'll be perfectly safe.

07:12.000 --> 07:16.000
Come on, Link, let's go. Check out the festival.

07:16.000 --> 07:19.000
Hold on, let me take a little flip.

07:20.000 --> 07:22.000
Friends owned. Are you joking me?

07:22.000 --> 07:25.000
Do you remember that meme that went really viral?

07:25.000 --> 07:28.000
And it was like, a knight. It was like a princess and a knight

07:28.000 --> 07:31.000
and the princess was getting like booed by the crowd or something.

07:31.000 --> 07:34.000
Now sell it. You can't sell a sword.

07:34.000 --> 07:37.000
Oh, you called me a sell sword, exactly. I got you. 4k.

07:37.000 --> 07:41.000
Check out the festival under her skirt.

07:41.000 --> 07:44.000
Rifle ends. You're feeling it the day you knocked in Ellie's.

07:44.000 --> 07:48.000
Now, if I'm not mistaken, if you're a snowberry,

07:48.000 --> 07:51.000
there should be a membership ASMR going on right now.

07:51.000 --> 07:53.000
Question mark. I have no idea.

07:53.000 --> 07:56.000
I think that's from Aces schedule.

07:58.000 --> 08:01.000
Mercy's off the day. I'm trying to use my autism.

08:01.000 --> 08:04.000
Azura is also off today.

08:04.000 --> 08:07.000
Emmy and Sheebie is on.

08:07.000 --> 08:11.000
Sheebie has a collab and Emmy has a collab

08:11.000 --> 08:15.000
and a day's time with people not in real life.

08:15.000 --> 08:19.000
Thank you, question mark. I can't remember what they're playing today.

08:19.000 --> 08:22.000
That's right. She had to reschedule.

08:22.000 --> 08:25.000
She pushed it to tomorrow. It's delayed.

08:25.000 --> 08:28.000
Oh, probably Aces' call. Alright, okay.

08:28.000 --> 08:32.000
Je comprends, je comprends. Right, let me try and host this honey tea down.

08:32.000 --> 08:35.000
Next week, we're going to write the honey tea plot together,

08:35.000 --> 08:38.000
so I see exactly what you want me to say and I was so fucking excited.

08:39.000 --> 08:42.000
Wow, listen to that music.

08:42.000 --> 08:45.000
This is a Game Boy Advance game.

08:45.000 --> 08:50.000
Oh, listen to that harp, that harmonious.

08:50.000 --> 08:52.000
Wow.

08:52.000 --> 08:54.000
It's so good.

08:54.000 --> 08:56.000
I saw it.

08:58.000 --> 09:04.000
I was going to actually consider making the songs for Jin to be still for this game.

09:04.000 --> 09:06.000
I don't know.

09:06.000 --> 09:11.000
The rules are, if there's any more background music that gets produced,

09:11.000 --> 09:14.000
it has to be a childhood game or a game that I really like.

09:14.000 --> 09:19.000
But Zelda is very peaceful, but I'm not actually sure we have any peaceful concept.

09:19.000 --> 09:21.000
And Jin too.

09:21.000 --> 09:24.000
So far, I don't think anyone is peaceful.

09:24.000 --> 09:27.000
I don't think we have one peaceful person at all.

09:27.000 --> 09:30.000
Azura. Azura is peaceful. She's peaceful.

09:31.000 --> 09:34.000
This would do Azura with a harp.

09:34.000 --> 09:37.000
I maybe should have gone with a harp.

09:37.000 --> 09:40.000
I would be real. I don't even remember all from yesterday.

09:40.000 --> 09:44.000
Turns out chugging a ball. Oh my God, you did not have a football ball.

09:45.000 --> 09:48.000
Strony, what's your opinion on the new Zelda game?

09:48.000 --> 09:50.000
Whatever your opinion is, because I've never played it.

09:50.000 --> 09:54.000
This is the only Legend of Zelda game I have ever had access to and played.

09:54.000 --> 09:59.000
What about Earthbound? I don't know what Earthbound is.

09:59.000 --> 10:04.000
I'm sorry, I'm just getting used to the controls on my...

10:04.000 --> 10:06.000
I'm not going to open this chest because it's got money in it,

10:06.000 --> 10:09.000
and I don't want to waste that opportunity to have that money.

10:09.000 --> 10:12.000
But look how freaking adorable this pixel art is.

10:12.000 --> 10:15.000
Is this not freaking precious?

10:15.000 --> 10:18.000
I'm going to give it to the princess like this.

10:18.000 --> 10:20.000
Yeah, you take that.

10:20.000 --> 10:22.000
Wait, can I do it over the bed?

10:22.000 --> 10:25.000
Hold on. Oh my God, there's two beds for me in the print.

10:25.000 --> 10:28.000
Yeah, you like that. Oh look, I'm making my bed.

10:28.000 --> 10:31.000
Oh look, I need to get all the sheets all smoothed out.

10:31.000 --> 10:33.000
I don't want any creases.

10:33.000 --> 10:35.000
Oh yeah, you like that princess.

10:35.000 --> 10:38.000
I need to practice and I need to get my practice in

10:38.000 --> 10:40.000
for what happens after the festival.

10:40.000 --> 10:42.000
Yeah, teach you that better lesson.

10:42.000 --> 10:44.000
Yo, is that the master sword?

10:44.000 --> 10:47.000
Earthbound is a game...

10:47.000 --> 10:49.000
is a game Ness is from.

10:49.000 --> 10:52.000
Might have seen it in Smash Bros. It's an old Nintendo game.

10:52.000 --> 10:54.000
Oh, come with us.

10:54.000 --> 10:56.000
Making the views.

10:56.000 --> 10:58.000
Link, over here.

10:58.000 --> 11:00.000
Oh, sorry, sorry, Zelda was just pumping.

11:00.000 --> 11:02.000
Sorry, I was just having a cheeky pump.

11:02.000 --> 11:04.000
Right, how's the roll button? Oh, there it is.

11:04.000 --> 11:07.000
Link, hurry, let's go.

11:07.000 --> 11:10.000
You moan in like every sentence.

11:10.000 --> 11:12.000
Is that how you normally talk?

11:12.000 --> 11:14.000
Over here. Come on, hurry up.

11:14.000 --> 11:16.000
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

11:16.000 --> 11:17.000
Princess, what's going on here?

11:17.000 --> 11:19.000
Well, here we are.

11:19.000 --> 11:21.000
I'm trying to play.

11:21.000 --> 11:24.000
Princess, princess, it's first thing in the morning, hen.

11:24.000 --> 11:26.000
Wah!

11:33.000 --> 11:36.000
Here we are, Link. Doesn't this look fun?

11:36.000 --> 11:39.000
Come on, let's look around.

11:39.000 --> 11:42.000
Wow, look all the free colors.

11:42.000 --> 11:45.000
I'm getting stimulated.

11:45.000 --> 11:48.000
Welcome to the PCORI Festival.

11:48.000 --> 11:52.000
They say that every 100 years, the PCORI comma high rule.

11:52.000 --> 11:54.000
And this is the 100th year to the day

11:54.000 --> 11:57.000
since the last time the PCORI were here.

11:59.000 --> 12:02.000
Wah, hello, princess.

12:02.000 --> 12:04.000
Link, here's the storyteller here.

12:04.000 --> 12:07.000
We should stop and listen to...

12:07.000 --> 12:09.000
I wonder what's over there.

12:09.000 --> 12:12.000
Jeez, you got ADHD, princess.

12:12.000 --> 12:14.000
You don't need a little stimulant.

12:14.000 --> 12:15.000
I can stimulate you.

12:15.000 --> 12:17.000
So the PCORI are real.

12:17.000 --> 12:19.000
My father always told me they were.

12:19.000 --> 12:21.000
Oh, look at that.

12:21.000 --> 12:22.000
I know.

12:22.000 --> 12:24.000
As long as she's happy, that's the main thing.

12:24.000 --> 12:26.000
Hey, wasn't there going to be

12:26.000 --> 12:29.000
a sword fighting tournament at the castle?

12:29.000 --> 12:31.000
I wonder who won this year.

12:31.000 --> 12:33.000
Oh, wow, over here.

12:35.000 --> 12:37.000
Oh, it is this.

12:37.000 --> 12:39.000
Oh, pardon me.

12:40.000 --> 12:43.000
We have a winner.

12:43.000 --> 12:44.000
Oh my.

12:44.000 --> 12:46.000
Oh my, Princess Zelda.

12:46.000 --> 12:49.000
You won the grand prize in her drawing.

12:49.000 --> 12:52.000
Wow, that's totally not rigged against everyone.

12:52.000 --> 12:56.000
You get your choice of any of these wonderful prizes.

12:56.000 --> 12:58.000
What will it be?

12:58.000 --> 13:02.000
First, we have this lovely heart-shaped stone.

13:02.000 --> 13:04.000
Next, we have...

13:04.000 --> 13:07.000
This magnificent gem.

13:07.000 --> 13:12.000
And finally, there's this tiny shield.

13:12.000 --> 13:15.000
So which one will you like?

13:15.000 --> 13:16.000
Let me guess.

13:16.000 --> 13:17.000
The jewel?

13:17.000 --> 13:20.000
Oh, but this heart-stone is very cute, too.

13:20.000 --> 13:23.000
Choose whichever one you like.

13:23.000 --> 13:25.000
This shield is so adorable.

13:25.000 --> 13:26.000
I heard that.

13:26.000 --> 13:28.000
She likes a small tiny.

13:28.000 --> 13:30.000
I think I'll take it.

13:33.000 --> 13:35.000
Following Strony around the convention

13:35.000 --> 13:37.000
late to the school arts alley.

13:37.000 --> 13:38.000
What?

13:38.000 --> 13:40.000
I'm looking for Rebecca art.

13:40.000 --> 13:41.000
What? Why?

13:41.000 --> 13:43.000
Why would you want that ugly thing?

13:43.000 --> 13:45.000
What about the heart-stone?

13:45.000 --> 13:46.000
It's cute.

13:46.000 --> 13:49.000
Oh, or this giant gem. It's pretty.

13:49.000 --> 13:51.000
Honestly, they're both much nicer

13:51.000 --> 13:53.000
than that nasty little shield thing.

13:53.000 --> 13:54.000
Jeez.

13:54.000 --> 13:57.000
Can I put this in a script?

13:57.000 --> 13:59.000
Nope, I want the shield.

13:59.000 --> 14:01.000
Can I have it?

14:01.000 --> 14:03.000
What a strange princess you are.

14:03.000 --> 14:04.000
Well, okay.

14:04.000 --> 14:07.000
Here's your teeny tiny shield.

14:11.000 --> 14:13.000
Here, I want to give you a present.

14:13.000 --> 14:16.000
It'll match the size of your...

14:16.000 --> 14:18.000
Doesn't the shield suit you perfectly?

14:18.000 --> 14:19.000
Like...

14:22.000 --> 14:24.000
Give you a small shield.

14:24.000 --> 14:26.000
Hold the button to protect yourself.

14:26.000 --> 14:28.000
It is a little embarrassing though.

14:28.000 --> 14:29.000
It's so tiny.

14:29.000 --> 14:32.000
What the heck is going on here?

14:34.000 --> 14:36.000
Oh, he's stutting on him.

14:36.000 --> 14:38.000
Yep, just as I thought.

14:38.000 --> 14:39.000
You look great.

14:39.000 --> 14:40.000
Now, if anything happens,

14:40.000 --> 14:42.000
you can protect me with that shield.

14:42.000 --> 14:44.000
Oh, I almost forgot.

14:44.000 --> 14:47.000
We have to take Master Smith's sword to the castle.

14:47.000 --> 14:48.000
Let's go, Link.

14:48.000 --> 14:50.000
How do I do this?

14:50.000 --> 14:51.000
What?

14:53.000 --> 14:55.000
I will protect you, my lady.

14:55.000 --> 14:57.000
My lady, come, come, my lady.

14:57.000 --> 14:58.000
You must sugar fly.

14:58.000 --> 14:59.000
My bunny, my heady.

14:59.000 --> 15:00.000
That's not the words.

15:00.000 --> 15:01.000
Oh, what the fuck?

15:01.000 --> 15:02.000
Sorry.

15:05.000 --> 15:08.000
This game explains your first outing on Patreon.

15:08.000 --> 15:09.000
Come on, Link.

15:09.000 --> 15:11.000
Let's hurry to the castle.

15:12.000 --> 15:14.000
Wa-wa-wa-wa-wa.

15:16.000 --> 15:17.000
Bonk.

15:17.000 --> 15:18.000
Oh!

15:18.000 --> 15:19.000
Hey!

15:19.000 --> 15:20.000
Ouch!

15:21.000 --> 15:24.000
Not to be the business scrub...

15:24.000 --> 15:25.000
Business scrub.

15:25.000 --> 15:26.000
That's me.

15:26.000 --> 15:28.000
Business scrub.

15:28.000 --> 15:29.000
Wait, that is the same.

15:29.000 --> 15:31.000
It must be the business scrub.

15:31.000 --> 15:34.000
I heard the soldiers talking about it.

15:34.000 --> 15:36.000
They were just saying a dicky scrub

15:36.000 --> 15:39.000
had been hassled in all the passages by...

15:39.000 --> 15:41.000
Link, do something about it.

15:41.000 --> 15:43.000
Otherwise, we can't get to the castle.

15:43.000 --> 15:45.000
If only we had some way to defend ourselves

15:45.000 --> 15:47.000
against those nuts of his.

15:47.000 --> 15:48.000
Wait, what?

15:50.000 --> 15:52.000
It's too early in the morning.

15:52.000 --> 15:54.000
It's too early.

15:55.000 --> 15:57.000
Please forgive me, sir.

15:57.000 --> 15:59.000
I heard that was a festival

15:59.000 --> 16:01.000
and I came to town helping my...

16:01.000 --> 16:03.000
to hawk my words.

16:03.000 --> 16:06.000
Unfortunately, we scrubs have a tendency

16:06.000 --> 16:08.000
to spit nuts as we speak.

16:08.000 --> 16:10.000
Everyone's got scared and ran away

16:10.000 --> 16:12.000
and no one would buy anything.

16:12.000 --> 16:14.000
This is a terrible place to do business.

16:14.000 --> 16:16.000
I'm going back to my cave.

16:19.000 --> 16:22.000
I actually feel a little sorry for that business scrub.

16:22.000 --> 16:24.000
But that net hurt!

16:25.000 --> 16:27.000
Oh well, he won't be hassling anyone now.

16:27.000 --> 16:29.000
We better hurry to the castle.

16:30.000 --> 16:32.000
Wow.

16:41.000 --> 16:43.000
I'm getting Australia overload.

16:59.000 --> 17:01.000
That's kind of the part of the plan, you know?

17:01.000 --> 17:03.000
You see, we've not executed the plan yet

17:03.000 --> 17:05.000
but there's many ways to main break them.

17:20.000 --> 17:22.000
I'm sorry, Link, but I'd better go.

17:22.000 --> 17:24.000
I have to prepare for the ceremony.

17:24.000 --> 17:26.000
I had a good time at the festival.

17:26.000 --> 17:28.000
Thanks for coming with me.

17:30.000 --> 17:32.000
Since you're here, Link,

17:32.000 --> 17:34.000
why didn't you join us for the award ceremony?

17:34.000 --> 17:36.000
No point in going home, old chap.

17:36.000 --> 17:38.000
Just join us.

17:38.000 --> 17:40.000
Why not? You're here anyway.

17:40.000 --> 17:42.000
Oh, look, it's me and the boy, Potho.

17:44.000 --> 17:46.000
I do know about that sword, Link.

17:46.000 --> 17:48.000
It is called the PCORI BLADE

17:48.000 --> 17:50.000
and it looks much evil.

17:50.000 --> 17:52.000
What?

17:52.000 --> 17:54.000
And it locks much evil away in that chest.

17:54.000 --> 17:56.000
Sorry, it's a bit early in the morning

17:56.000 --> 17:58.000
to be talking about Gothic architecture.

17:58.000 --> 18:01.000
The PCORI BLADE is sacred among the people of Hyrule.

18:01.000 --> 18:03.000
The legend has it that, long ago,

18:03.000 --> 18:05.000
the PCORI gave us this blade.

18:05.000 --> 18:07.000
Whoever wins the competition

18:07.000 --> 18:10.000
earns the honor of touching the sacred blade.

18:10.000 --> 18:13.000
Would you let me touch your sacred blade?

18:15.000 --> 18:17.000
Whoa, big daddy in the horse.

18:17.000 --> 18:19.000
Fuck's it, he's truly twice the size of his elder.

18:22.000 --> 18:25.000
Let the award ceremony commence.

18:25.000 --> 18:28.000
Avati, champion of the competition,

18:28.000 --> 18:30.000
you may approach the blade.

18:32.000 --> 18:34.000
Was that Conqueror's Bad Ferdy?

18:34.000 --> 18:36.000
It absolutely was.

18:39.000 --> 18:41.000
King Chonk of Hyrule.

18:44.000 --> 18:47.000
To think things would go this well,

18:47.000 --> 18:50.000
the PCORI BLADE and the bone chests

18:50.000 --> 18:53.000
spoken of the Hyrllian Reborn.

18:53.000 --> 18:56.000
This chest must hold that which I seek.

18:56.000 --> 18:59.000
I relieve you of its contents now.

19:10.000 --> 19:12.000
Do not interfere with that.

19:12.000 --> 19:14.000
Me?

19:14.000 --> 19:18.000
As Victor, I earned this right to approach the PCORI BLADE.

19:18.000 --> 19:21.000
I've been waiting for this moment.

19:22.000 --> 19:25.000
I don't know why Scottish people are evil, but...

19:25.000 --> 19:28.000
Oh wait, maybe they'd be British, like English.

19:28.000 --> 19:30.000
I've been waiting for this moment.

19:30.000 --> 19:32.000
Okay, okay, sorry.

19:37.000 --> 19:39.000
Protecta Zelda?

19:39.000 --> 19:41.000
Eh, yeah, no, let's do it.

19:43.000 --> 19:44.000
Wait, what's the British voice?

19:44.000 --> 19:45.000
Who are you?

19:45.000 --> 19:46.000
Why are you doing this?

19:46.000 --> 19:47.000
Oh wait, that's Zelda.

19:47.000 --> 19:49.000
Who are you? Why are you doing this?

19:50.000 --> 19:53.000
The princess with the mystic aura.

19:53.000 --> 19:56.000
The power that was gifted to the people of Hyrule

19:56.000 --> 20:01.000
still flows within the veins of that lady.

20:01.000 --> 20:04.000
The veins of the ladies of its royal family.

20:04.000 --> 20:05.000
Interesting.

20:05.000 --> 20:09.000
If I leave you now, you will only cause me trouble later.

20:09.000 --> 20:11.000
That will never do.

20:13.000 --> 20:15.000
To stone with you!

20:16.000 --> 20:17.000
Run now!

20:17.000 --> 20:19.000
Ah, Zelda now!

20:23.000 --> 20:26.000
All who stand in my way shall share this fate.

20:26.000 --> 20:29.000
Now to find out what power awaits me in the chest.

20:38.000 --> 20:39.000
Ete!

20:39.000 --> 20:43.000
There is nothing in there but a rabble of monsters.

20:43.000 --> 20:45.000
What's the meaning of this?

20:45.000 --> 20:50.000
Well, I know the force and I'm after it's somewhere out there.

20:50.000 --> 20:52.000
I'm in no hurry.

20:52.000 --> 20:54.000
I can take my time searching for it.

20:59.000 --> 21:01.000
Classic British stealing things.

21:01.000 --> 21:02.000
Exactly, yes.

21:02.000 --> 21:05.000
I thought Star Wars reference too, but I'm probably just...

21:05.000 --> 21:08.000
Oh my god, we're in a castello!

21:08.000 --> 21:11.000
Oh my god, this is the Borgia Castle, clearly.

21:11.000 --> 21:13.000
Wake up, wake up.

21:13.000 --> 21:15.000
Put on a little bit of makeup.

21:15.000 --> 21:17.000
Oh, we need to make the bed for the maid.

21:17.000 --> 21:18.000
Oh, I'm so sorry.

21:18.000 --> 21:19.000
Oh, you want to take over?

21:19.000 --> 21:20.000
Oh, hold on.

21:20.000 --> 21:23.000
Oh shit, I interact with people when you do that.

21:24.000 --> 21:27.000
I was gonna hump her, but I interact with people when you do that.

21:31.000 --> 21:32.000
Erlink, you're awake.

21:32.000 --> 21:33.000
Are you feeling alright?

21:33.000 --> 21:35.000
Stand at my side.

21:35.000 --> 21:37.000
The king of Hyrule is about to speak.

21:38.000 --> 21:41.000
It is as you have all heard.

21:41.000 --> 21:47.000
A sorcerer named Vati has cursed my fair Zelda and turned her to stone.

21:47.000 --> 21:52.000
If we had the sacred PCORI blade, we likely could have broken the curse.

21:52.000 --> 21:55.000
But Vati shattered the blade.

21:55.000 --> 21:58.000
However, I have not given up hope.

21:58.000 --> 22:00.000
What do you know about the PCORI?

22:02.000 --> 22:05.000
Er, the PCORI, not much.

22:06.000 --> 22:07.000
Beyond what?

22:07.000 --> 22:09.000
Oh fuck, these both have the same voice.

22:09.000 --> 22:15.000
Beyond what the fairytales say, they're supposed to be very tiny if I remember correctly.

22:16.000 --> 22:21.000
It is the ones from the fairytales, but the PCORI are no mere legend.

22:21.000 --> 22:23.000
They are certain exists.

22:23.000 --> 22:27.000
No one outside of the royal family knows the truth about them.

22:27.000 --> 22:33.000
The PCORI who forged the sacred blade lived deeper than the Minish Wars.

22:33.000 --> 22:39.000
They should be able to repair the broken blade and reforge the sword.

22:39.000 --> 22:41.000
What?

22:41.000 --> 22:45.000
There must be dispatch the soldiers there at once.

22:45.000 --> 22:48.000
No, soldiers will not do.

22:48.000 --> 22:52.000
The PCORI do not show themselves to anyone but children.

22:52.000 --> 22:58.000
Our soldiers could search for days and still fight no cycle.

22:59.000 --> 23:02.000
I see.

23:02.000 --> 23:05.000
That's the case, then why not send Link?

23:05.000 --> 23:11.000
If Link has recovered then yes, I would like to ask him of this.

23:11.000 --> 23:15.000
Please, turn my precious Zelda back to normal.

23:15.000 --> 23:20.000
The PCORI should know how to create a new sacred sword.

23:20.000 --> 23:26.000
It will be a dangerous journey, now that those monsters have been freed.

23:26.000 --> 23:32.000
Please, take the sword with you along with the broken PCORI blade.

23:36.000 --> 23:39.000
Broken PCORI blade!

23:40.000 --> 23:46.000
This is part of the sword needed to be forged with sacred sword. Do not lose it.

23:49.000 --> 23:51.000
Smith sword!

23:51.000 --> 23:54.000
It's a sharp blade made by your grandfather.

23:54.000 --> 23:55.000
Very well then.

23:55.000 --> 24:00.000
Very well then. Send the soldiers to search for that in the world.

24:04.000 --> 24:09.000
Deep within the Minish Woods you will find the place called Deepwood Shrine.

24:09.000 --> 24:14.000
Once, humans and PCORI ship that shrine as a meeting place.

24:14.000 --> 24:19.000
I think it would be best if you started your search there.

24:20.000 --> 24:24.000
Take this map with you.

24:24.000 --> 24:28.000
If you get lost on your way to the forest then please check your map.

24:28.000 --> 24:31.000
Just press start and then this stuff.

24:31.000 --> 24:34.000
And I've marked it on the location of the forest view.

24:34.000 --> 24:36.000
Gluck and be careful.

24:37.000 --> 24:40.000
You got the map of Hyrule!

24:40.000 --> 24:42.000
Now you'll never get lost.

24:43.000 --> 24:44.000
Bottom right.

24:44.000 --> 24:46.000
You have to go bottom right, okay?

24:46.000 --> 24:49.000
The child will learn to kill. Send the child.

24:49.000 --> 24:52.000
The child and yearn for the mines.

24:52.000 --> 24:55.000
I am counting on you, Link.

24:55.000 --> 24:58.000
Only you can break Barty's curse of free princess.

25:00.000 --> 25:03.000
Okay, let's unprofessionally roll out of this castle.

25:04.000 --> 25:07.000
I like the game. What's the name of the country?

25:10.000 --> 25:13.000
This is based in America? What?

25:14.000 --> 25:16.000
The Chales will become a man.

25:16.000 --> 25:17.000
Be a man.

25:17.000 --> 25:21.000
You must be slipped as the Corsing River.

25:21.000 --> 25:24.000
Man, you must just take off that dress.

25:24.000 --> 25:26.000
Fire through the mouth.

25:26.000 --> 25:31.000
Man, you must just take off that dress.

25:31.000 --> 25:32.000
Miss...

25:44.000 --> 25:47.000
You're in my way, you're in my way, you're in my way.

25:47.000 --> 25:50.000
That's fine. I'll forgive you.

26:13.000 --> 26:21.000
Oh, we got coins!

26:22.000 --> 26:26.000
You've got one rupee. It's green. Don't spend all in one place.

26:26.000 --> 26:29.000
You guys wouldn't spend me all in one place, would you?

26:34.000 --> 26:37.000
I've not accidentally left reverb on, have I?

26:38.000 --> 26:40.000
One coin, let's go.

26:41.000 --> 26:45.000
You guys will have to remind me at the four-hour mark I'm to get off,

26:45.000 --> 26:48.000
because we're playing the rest of the game tomorrow.

26:48.000 --> 26:52.000
I'm doing the Forbidden Tearless, and I already didn't forget.

27:02.000 --> 27:06.000
Yes, I have played this game in childhood a couple of times,

27:06.000 --> 27:09.000
so I'm not too terrible.

27:09.000 --> 27:12.000
Watch me eat my words in about an hour's time, but...

27:12.000 --> 27:14.000
You can't do anything yet.

27:14.000 --> 27:16.000
I'm not in one place, but I'm sure you can.

27:16.000 --> 27:18.000
You're awesome.

27:18.000 --> 27:20.000
Multiple, but multiple, please.

27:20.000 --> 27:23.000
I know, I can't believe that I'm not finishing a game in one go.

27:23.000 --> 27:26.000
It's absolutely crazy. It's terrible.

27:28.000 --> 27:30.000
Help! Help me!

27:31.000 --> 27:32.000
Ouch!

27:32.000 --> 27:34.000
Want somebody stop him?

27:34.000 --> 27:36.000
Ow! Ow! Help! Somebody!

27:36.000 --> 27:38.000
Can't anyone hear me?

27:38.000 --> 27:40.000
I don't want boys to get these guys.

27:44.000 --> 27:46.000
No, it's definitely a guy-hat.

27:46.000 --> 27:48.000
There are many hats in the world.

27:48.000 --> 27:50.000
But this is a guy-hat.

27:54.000 --> 27:56.000
Hey, kid, you there!

27:58.000 --> 28:01.000
Hey, don't just stand there, do something!

28:02.000 --> 28:03.000
Ow!

28:03.000 --> 28:05.000
What's wrong with you?

28:05.000 --> 28:08.000
Do you like watching me take this piss?

28:08.000 --> 28:11.000
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

28:14.000 --> 28:16.000
Well done, that was close.

28:16.000 --> 28:18.000
Now that I couldn't handle that myself.

28:18.000 --> 28:20.000
But that's beside the point.

28:20.000 --> 28:24.000
What in the world is a lone child doing so deep in the woods?

28:24.000 --> 28:26.000
I see.

28:26.000 --> 28:30.000
The PCORI, you say, in Vati?

28:30.000 --> 28:32.000
Vati's curse someone what?

28:32.000 --> 28:34.000
The Sacred Blade?

28:34.000 --> 28:36.000
Is that so? I see, I see.

28:36.000 --> 28:39.000
Okay, you know, you know, I have quite a lot in common.

28:39.000 --> 28:42.000
You see, I too am on a quest to break the curse of Vati's.

28:43.000 --> 28:47.000
And you say they reforged the Sacred Blade can break...

28:47.000 --> 28:51.000
That reforging the Sacred Blade can break his curse, eh?

28:51.000 --> 28:54.000
Well, then you have found yourself a companion, my boy.

28:54.000 --> 28:56.000
My name's Ezlo.

28:56.000 --> 28:59.000
It's a pleasure to make your acquaintance.

29:00.000 --> 29:02.000
Speak.

29:02.000 --> 29:04.000
What? Is there something on my face?

29:04.000 --> 29:06.000
Quit staring, it's rude.

29:06.000 --> 29:08.000
Wait, wait, wait, I said.

29:08.000 --> 29:10.000
You walk so quickly, too quick in fact.

29:10.000 --> 29:12.000
Can you go any slower?

29:12.000 --> 29:15.000
Certainly you've noticed that I have no legs.

29:15.000 --> 29:17.000
Boy, take a good look at me.

29:17.000 --> 29:20.000
Do you really think I can walk that fast?

29:20.000 --> 29:22.000
Eugh!

29:22.000 --> 29:25.000
If this isn't one thing, it's another.

29:25.000 --> 29:28.000
You're a troublesome boy.

29:30.000 --> 29:33.000
There, now you can't possibly leave me behind.

29:33.000 --> 29:35.000
My, it's actually quite comfortable up here.

29:35.000 --> 29:37.000
More comfortable than it looks, surely?

29:37.000 --> 29:39.000
And much easier on me.

29:39.000 --> 29:41.000
Hey, quit your squirming, can't you sit still?

29:41.000 --> 29:43.000
See, there, there, there you go.

29:43.000 --> 29:44.000
Yes, yes, yes.

29:44.000 --> 29:46.000
That's it, much better.

29:46.000 --> 29:50.000
Now, I suppose a boy like you still has much to learn about the world.

29:50.000 --> 29:53.000
If ever you needed my insight, press select.

29:53.000 --> 29:55.000
I'll be happy to help.

29:55.000 --> 29:57.000
Eh, such a hopeless child.

29:58.000 --> 30:00.000
Ta-da!

30:00.000 --> 30:01.000
We have hats.

30:01.000 --> 30:02.000
Look at the drip.

30:02.000 --> 30:03.000
Read the drip.

30:03.000 --> 30:04.000
Read it.

30:04.000 --> 30:05.000
Read the drip.

30:05.000 --> 30:07.000
Is it posing?

30:07.000 --> 30:09.000
Is it starting on the floor?

30:09.000 --> 30:10.000
Look at the drip.

30:10.000 --> 30:11.000
Look at that hat physics.

30:11.000 --> 30:12.000
Look at the physics.

30:12.000 --> 30:15.000
When I go forward, the hat doesn't sing.

30:15.000 --> 30:17.000
Hold on for a moment.

30:17.000 --> 30:19.000
My boy will stumble across something important.

30:19.000 --> 30:21.000
The world of the Minish is very small

30:21.000 --> 30:23.000
and you're far too big to meet them now.

30:23.000 --> 30:24.000
Eh?

30:24.000 --> 30:25.000
Where's the Minish?

30:25.000 --> 30:26.000
Ah, yes, silly me.

30:26.000 --> 30:28.000
Allow me to explain.

30:28.000 --> 30:30.000
You humans call them Bakori,

30:30.000 --> 30:33.000
but they refer to themselves as the Minish.

30:33.000 --> 30:35.000
Strange how, in the world of humans,

30:35.000 --> 30:37.000
only this forest has kept the name.

30:37.000 --> 30:41.000
Anywho, deep in the forest, they built a tiny village.

30:41.000 --> 30:44.000
They were many who...

30:44.000 --> 30:46.000
Oh, a good woman.

30:46.000 --> 30:47.000
Live now.

30:47.000 --> 30:50.000
But if they're where to enter the village,

30:50.000 --> 30:53.000
we'll have to make you a touch smaller first.

30:53.000 --> 30:55.000
Look at that.

30:55.000 --> 30:59.000
At first glance, it appears to be a mere stump, yes?

30:59.000 --> 31:00.000
No.

31:00.000 --> 31:03.000
That stump is the portal used by people long ago

31:03.000 --> 31:05.000
to adjust their size.

31:05.000 --> 31:08.000
With my help, you can use it to shrink down to Minish size.

31:08.000 --> 31:11.000
Just stand at the stump and press this button.

31:11.000 --> 31:14.000
To return to normal, stand again and press the button.

31:14.000 --> 31:17.000
Get me up there and we'll give it a try.

31:19.000 --> 31:22.000
Humana, humana, humana, humana, humana, humana.

31:23.000 --> 31:27.000
Oh my god, we're in a tiny...

31:27.000 --> 31:31.000
Oh, look, we're doing butt bouncing on the wee mushrooms.

31:31.000 --> 31:33.000
Always so pretty cute.

31:34.000 --> 31:37.000
Welcome to the world through the eyes of the Minish.

31:37.000 --> 31:39.000
Now, aren't you glad you saved me?

31:39.000 --> 31:41.000
No need to thank me, though.

31:41.000 --> 31:44.000
Portals that reduce your size are all around

31:44.000 --> 31:46.000
in different shapes and sizes.

31:46.000 --> 31:48.000
If you want to return to normal,

31:48.000 --> 31:50.000
stand next to the portal and press N.

31:50.000 --> 31:53.000
But there is one thing you must know.

31:53.000 --> 31:57.000
Being Minish-sized is full of dangers.

31:57.000 --> 32:01.000
With mere puddles at your normal size are bottomless pits.

32:01.000 --> 32:04.000
And as your companion, if anything bad happens to you,

32:04.000 --> 32:06.000
it happens to me, too.

32:06.000 --> 32:09.000
So proceed with caution, my lad.

32:09.000 --> 32:11.000
If not for your sake, then for my own,

32:11.000 --> 32:14.000
why is the heck is he starting to scandinavian?

32:15.000 --> 32:17.000
Anus bibanus?

32:17.000 --> 32:19.000
What? Anus bibanus?

32:19.000 --> 32:21.000
Thank you for the tip.

32:21.000 --> 32:22.000
Wah! Oh, sorry, sorry.

32:22.000 --> 32:24.000
Neat timing, neat timing.

32:24.000 --> 32:26.000
Wah, wah, wah, wah!

32:27.000 --> 32:29.000
Red voice speedrun?

32:29.000 --> 32:30.000
Oh.

32:30.000 --> 32:31.000
Ah!

32:31.000 --> 32:33.000
Nando desu.

32:33.000 --> 32:36.000
I was there, I was there.

32:37.000 --> 32:38.000
Okay.

32:40.000 --> 32:42.000
Look, it's an acorn.

32:42.000 --> 32:44.000
Look, it's an acorn.

32:44.000 --> 32:45.000
Look, it's a leaf.

32:45.000 --> 32:46.000
Look, it's an acorn.

32:46.000 --> 32:48.000
Look, it's a leaf.

32:48.000 --> 32:49.000
Acorn.

32:49.000 --> 32:51.000
And there's clover.

32:51.000 --> 32:53.000
Minnish village.

32:56.000 --> 32:57.000
Wow.

32:57.000 --> 32:58.000
Hmm.

32:58.000 --> 33:01.000
It appears we have found the minnish village.

33:11.000 --> 33:13.000
We don't understand them yet,

33:13.000 --> 33:15.000
so they're just gonna go...

33:16.000 --> 33:20.000
I gather it's been quite some time since they last saw a human.

33:20.000 --> 33:21.000
What's that?

33:21.000 --> 33:24.000
You don't understand what they were saying just now?

33:24.000 --> 33:25.000
Ah, yes.

33:25.000 --> 33:27.000
That was the language of the minnish.

33:27.000 --> 33:30.000
That's a little different from the dialect I'm most familiar with.

33:30.000 --> 33:34.000
I'm afraid I didn't catch most of what they said myself.

33:35.000 --> 33:38.000
But perhaps there is someone here who understands your language.

33:38.000 --> 33:40.000
We should look around.

33:40.000 --> 33:42.000
So we need to find the village elder,

33:42.000 --> 33:44.000
which he should be up here for now.

33:45.000 --> 33:46.000
Oh.

33:46.000 --> 33:48.000
You got a heart.

33:48.000 --> 33:50.000
They replenish your life a little bit.

33:50.000 --> 33:51.000
I never played this.

33:51.000 --> 33:52.000
It's so pretty.

33:52.000 --> 33:54.000
It's a cute little pixel thing.

33:54.000 --> 33:56.000
Good voice acting thing.

33:56.000 --> 33:57.000
Fried my voice.

33:57.000 --> 33:58.000
Ah, Denpa.

33:58.000 --> 34:00.000
I finally recorded my side of the line,

34:00.000 --> 34:01.000
so I need to edit it.

34:01.000 --> 34:02.000
Soon.

34:02.000 --> 34:04.000
Soon I will update you, Denpa.

34:04.000 --> 34:07.000
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

34:07.000 --> 34:08.000
Pick up the heart here.

34:08.000 --> 34:10.000
You got a piece of heart.

34:10.000 --> 34:12.000
Select four to make a new heart container

34:12.000 --> 34:14.000
for even more life energy.

34:16.000 --> 34:18.000
One of the best pixel art games,

34:18.000 --> 34:20.000
they put their whole penussy in this.

34:20.000 --> 34:22.000
That's what we see.

34:25.000 --> 34:27.000
Right, we're now talking to the elder.

34:29.000 --> 34:32.000
I've never seen an outfit like that before.

34:32.000 --> 34:34.000
Are you a human?

34:34.000 --> 34:36.000
Oh my, it's been some quite some time

34:36.000 --> 34:38.000
since any human has come here.

34:38.000 --> 34:40.000
My name is Faustari.

34:40.000 --> 34:43.000
I watch the abbey as well as the shrine in the north.

34:43.000 --> 34:46.000
You seem to be having some trouble with our language, aren't you?

34:46.000 --> 34:47.000
Yeah.

34:47.000 --> 34:49.000
You could use the jabbernut.

34:49.000 --> 34:52.000
It will allow you to understand our tongue.

34:52.000 --> 34:55.000
You should be able to find one in the barrel else,

34:55.000 --> 34:56.000
just selfie.

34:56.000 --> 34:58.000
I'll make them cockney.

34:58.000 --> 35:00.000
I need to start using the cockney accent

35:00.000 --> 35:03.000
because I'm starting to blend all the guys' voices together.

35:04.000 --> 35:06.000
I think this is above or below?

35:06.000 --> 35:08.000
I think it's below.

35:11.000 --> 35:13.000
Oh, no. Don't climb that again.

35:17.000 --> 35:18.000
Check.

35:19.000 --> 35:21.000
Uh, like, this must be the jabbernut.

35:22.000 --> 35:24.000
I don't know what voice I gave him.

35:26.000 --> 35:28.000
This must be the jabbernut for Starry, told you about.

35:28.000 --> 35:32.000
Well, you'd be better eat it if you plan on making any progress at all.

35:32.000 --> 35:34.000
That's what I'm just making, I'm Scottish.

35:34.000 --> 35:37.000
You ate the jabbernut, now you can understand the language of the Minnish.

35:37.000 --> 35:41.000
I think I'm just going to have to make my hat Scottish

35:41.000 --> 35:43.000
because I can't for the life of my mix of these.

35:45.000 --> 35:47.000
Make sure it's all the...

35:48.000 --> 35:50.000
Wait, what do I need dinner?

35:50.000 --> 35:52.000
I can eat, do I go back to the abbey?

35:55.000 --> 35:56.000
So you've eaten the jabbernut,

35:56.000 --> 35:58.000
is you're eating the jabbernut yet?

35:58.000 --> 35:59.000
And now you can understand us.

35:59.000 --> 36:02.000
Yeah, sorry, but I know a little bit about the sewers.

36:02.000 --> 36:03.000
I'm just the elder.

36:03.000 --> 36:04.000
I'm sure the elder can help.

36:04.000 --> 36:06.000
Yeah, yeah, head over to the elder.

36:06.000 --> 36:08.000
Yeah, you're not my problem anymore.

36:08.000 --> 36:10.000
Now you've got the jabbernut inside you.

36:11.000 --> 36:13.000
Okay, to the elder.

36:14.000 --> 36:15.000
Hello.

36:20.000 --> 36:23.000
Bro, I'm out of accents.

36:25.000 --> 36:26.000
Well, I'm making French.

36:26.000 --> 36:27.000
Oh, you must...

36:27.000 --> 36:29.000
You speak our language?

36:29.000 --> 36:33.000
It's been quite a while since we've heard of outsiders

36:33.000 --> 36:34.000
speak our tongue.

36:34.000 --> 36:36.000
We have a little to offer you in these woods.

36:36.000 --> 36:38.000
But please enjoy your stay.

36:38.000 --> 36:39.000
Thank you for your...

36:41.000 --> 36:42.000
Thanks for your offer,

36:42.000 --> 36:44.000
but we have no time to relax.

36:44.000 --> 36:46.000
My name is Ezlo.

36:46.000 --> 36:47.000
This trial is link.

36:47.000 --> 36:49.000
We need to break a curse

36:49.000 --> 36:52.000
that has been cast on the Princess of Hyrule.

36:52.000 --> 36:55.000
To do so, we'll need to reforge the broken PCORI blade.

36:56.000 --> 36:59.000
Yes, you have come.

36:59.000 --> 37:02.000
You're now hoping to have the blade reforged.

37:02.000 --> 37:03.000
I will...

37:03.000 --> 37:05.000
If that is what you are after,

37:05.000 --> 37:08.000
you need firm mystic elements.

37:08.000 --> 37:09.000
We...

37:09.000 --> 37:10.000
Wait, wait.

37:10.000 --> 37:13.000
These elements are the chrysaline

37:13.000 --> 37:16.000
firms of the energies of this world.

37:16.000 --> 37:19.000
Only by infusing the blade with these energies

37:19.000 --> 37:20.000
can a new blade be forged.

37:20.000 --> 37:21.000
Yes, so here.

37:21.000 --> 37:22.000
Give me your map.

37:22.000 --> 37:24.000
I can mark out where these three elements are.

37:24.000 --> 37:26.000
Three elements can be found as three elements.

37:26.000 --> 37:27.000
Oh!

37:27.000 --> 37:29.000
Oh, these elements, not three.

37:29.000 --> 37:31.000
I've not got my glasses on.

37:32.000 --> 37:35.000
The earth element can be found in the shrine

37:35.000 --> 37:38.000
to the enough of Fastari's army.

37:38.000 --> 37:40.000
Speak with the Fastari.

37:40.000 --> 37:43.000
He will show you the path to the shrine's entrance.

37:43.000 --> 37:45.000
Go without caution.

37:45.000 --> 37:46.000
Go with caution.

37:46.000 --> 37:50.000
Evil creatures have a little middle home in our shrine.

37:50.000 --> 37:51.000
Yes.

37:51.000 --> 37:52.000
Wait.

37:52.000 --> 37:54.000
Speak to me at once,

37:54.000 --> 37:56.000
if you have found the earth element.

37:56.000 --> 37:57.000
Okay.

37:58.000 --> 37:59.000
As a French, that makes sense.

37:59.000 --> 38:00.000
Perfect.

38:00.000 --> 38:01.000
Forget it.

38:01.000 --> 38:04.000
French people cannot stop themselves from going...

38:06.000 --> 38:07.000
That's the only...

38:07.000 --> 38:10.000
If you ever want to assimilate as a French person,

38:10.000 --> 38:12.000
just go...

38:12.000 --> 38:14.000
In between your sentences

38:14.000 --> 38:16.000
and instantly you're French.

38:16.000 --> 38:19.000
You used to go to the shrine very well this way then.

38:22.000 --> 38:24.000
I will be settled in recently.

38:24.000 --> 38:25.000
Just be careful.

38:25.000 --> 38:27.000
It's a bit dangerous.

38:29.000 --> 38:31.000
We need an Aussie accent somewhere.

38:31.000 --> 38:32.000
Oh!

38:32.000 --> 38:33.000
Oh, sugar.

38:33.000 --> 38:34.000
I forgot to pick this up.

38:34.000 --> 38:35.000
We'll pick it up.

38:35.000 --> 38:36.000
We'll pick it up on the way back.

38:36.000 --> 38:38.000
Don't let me forget this.

38:41.000 --> 38:42.000
Equals French.

38:42.000 --> 38:45.000
You can hug the upper right side of the tower for a heart.

38:48.000 --> 38:49.000
Yeah.

38:49.000 --> 38:52.000
I was talking about there being monsters inside, didn't I?

38:52.000 --> 38:53.000
Hey, now.

38:53.000 --> 38:56.000
There's no reason to be afraid of anything.

38:56.000 --> 38:57.000
I'll be waiting right here though.

38:57.000 --> 38:58.000
No, wait.

38:58.000 --> 38:59.000
What am I saying?

38:59.000 --> 39:01.000
I'm not letting you leave me alone out here.

39:01.000 --> 39:03.000
No, because you're not being myself.

39:03.000 --> 39:04.000
Right, I can't...

39:04.000 --> 39:06.000
I don't have the sucky pot yet.

39:06.000 --> 39:07.000
But there should...

39:07.000 --> 39:08.000
There is a heart piece in here.

39:10.000 --> 39:12.000
Can you guys see that fine?

39:12.000 --> 39:14.000
Does the brightness seem fine?

39:14.000 --> 39:16.000
Because I keep mentioning this.

39:16.000 --> 39:17.000
My Crash Bandicoot stream.

39:17.000 --> 39:21.000
The display was correct for me, but wrong on stream.

39:21.000 --> 39:22.000
You've got a small key.

39:22.000 --> 39:24.000
Use it to open lock doors and blocks.

39:24.000 --> 39:27.000
You can use it only in this dungeon though.

39:27.000 --> 39:28.000
It's all good.

39:28.000 --> 39:29.000
Good to go.

39:29.000 --> 39:30.000
Okay.

39:30.000 --> 39:31.000
There's a lock door here.

39:31.000 --> 39:33.000
See if you can find the key to...

39:36.000 --> 39:39.000
I'm a few steps ahead of you, but it's okay.

39:40.000 --> 39:42.000
Maybe just a little bit drop on you.

39:42.000 --> 39:45.000
Honestly, I thought that was really creative.

39:46.000 --> 39:47.000
Do you see that level?

39:47.000 --> 39:49.000
I think you should be able to pull it.

39:49.000 --> 39:52.000
Just stand in front of it and press and then grab it.

39:52.000 --> 39:53.000
Then use...

39:53.000 --> 39:54.000
Pull it.

39:56.000 --> 39:57.000
Look at this detail.

39:57.000 --> 39:59.000
If you keep pushing, the space turns red.

39:59.000 --> 40:00.000
Like, come on.

40:00.000 --> 40:03.000
I have to admit, Nintendo cooked a little bit for this one.

40:05.000 --> 40:06.000
Mug.

40:08.000 --> 40:09.000
Not today.

40:11.000 --> 40:12.000
Wait, is this...

40:12.000 --> 40:14.000
Yeah, if you want to do a little backtrack and just do that.

40:16.000 --> 40:18.000
Well, they'll have a grunk.

40:18.000 --> 40:21.000
Right, you cannot hurt these guys yet.

40:22.000 --> 40:25.000
Whoa, look at the size of that barrel.

40:26.000 --> 40:28.000
Yeah, how silly, but sorry.

40:28.000 --> 40:29.000
It's not big, we're just small.

40:29.000 --> 40:30.000
Sorry, sorry.

40:30.000 --> 40:32.000
Forgot about that perspective and everything.

40:32.000 --> 40:33.000
You know what I mean?

40:33.000 --> 40:35.000
I mean, you've got to respect him.

40:35.000 --> 40:36.000
Sorry about that.

40:36.000 --> 40:38.000
You cannot hurt these guys yet,

40:38.000 --> 40:41.000
but you have to like push them out of your way, basically.

40:41.000 --> 40:42.000
Is there anything up here?

40:42.000 --> 40:43.000
No.

40:44.000 --> 40:46.000
I love the Game Boy Zelda games.

40:46.000 --> 40:47.000
They're fire.

40:47.000 --> 40:49.000
What's the other Game Boy Zelda games?

40:49.000 --> 40:50.000
I might have to give it a try.

40:51.000 --> 40:53.000
So don't mind us.

40:53.000 --> 40:54.000
Just scoo...

40:54.000 --> 40:55.000
scoozy me.

40:56.000 --> 40:58.000
A little bit of scoochy cream.

40:58.000 --> 40:59.000
Push it in.

41:00.000 --> 41:01.000
That's the budget.

41:02.000 --> 41:03.000
Push it real good.

41:05.000 --> 41:07.000
So we have now unlocked the barrel,

41:07.000 --> 41:09.000
so it can now rotate when we're inside.

41:10.000 --> 41:12.000
So all we need to do is...

41:12.000 --> 41:14.000
Oh, here, I think.

41:14.000 --> 41:15.000
I think.

41:17.000 --> 41:18.000
What?

41:18.000 --> 41:19.000
Hey, be careful.

41:19.000 --> 41:20.000
I'm allowed to barrel just moved.

41:20.000 --> 41:21.000
Wait, maybe?

41:21.000 --> 41:22.000
Is this one quick?

41:22.000 --> 41:23.000
Is it?

41:23.000 --> 41:24.000
No, I'm getting rabied.

41:25.000 --> 41:26.000
Is this one first?

41:26.000 --> 41:27.000
Is this one first?

41:31.000 --> 41:32.000
Is it?

41:32.000 --> 41:33.000
No.

41:33.000 --> 41:34.000
Wait.

41:34.000 --> 41:35.000
Ah, it was that one.

41:35.000 --> 41:36.000
I knew it was that one.

41:36.000 --> 41:37.000
I'm just thinking of you.

41:38.000 --> 41:39.000
The link to the path.

41:39.000 --> 41:40.000
I played the hiccup.

41:40.000 --> 41:41.000
Link's awake.

41:41.000 --> 41:42.000
Link's awake.

41:42.000 --> 41:44.000
Maybe we should give it a shot.

41:44.000 --> 41:45.000
Is it easy?

41:45.000 --> 41:47.000
This is supposed to be a kids game,

41:47.000 --> 41:48.000
but I have to admit,

41:48.000 --> 41:50.000
the boss fight at the end...

41:50.000 --> 41:52.000
God, it's three hits now.

41:52.000 --> 41:53.000
The boss fight at the end?

41:53.000 --> 41:54.000
No bueno.

41:57.000 --> 41:58.000
So we just want to do...

41:58.000 --> 41:59.000
I see the heart.

42:00.000 --> 42:01.000
So we're going to push that out

42:01.000 --> 42:03.000
so we have access to what was here.

42:04.000 --> 42:05.000
I don't know.

42:05.000 --> 42:06.000
No.

42:11.000 --> 42:13.000
Ah, don't destroy this paw.

42:14.000 --> 42:15.000
What we need now

42:15.000 --> 42:17.000
is starting to hold down the switch.

42:17.000 --> 42:18.000
Wait, I'm on it.

42:18.000 --> 42:19.000
I'm on it.

42:19.000 --> 42:20.000
Then you worry.

42:21.000 --> 42:23.000
Just don't play Metroid Fusion.

42:23.000 --> 42:24.000
10 out of 10.

42:24.000 --> 42:25.000
I hate it.

42:25.000 --> 42:26.000
What?

42:26.000 --> 42:27.000
Oh, 10 out of 10.

42:27.000 --> 42:28.000
You hate.

42:28.000 --> 42:29.000
Wait, is this a shortcut as well?

42:29.000 --> 42:30.000
Yeah.

42:30.000 --> 42:31.000
I'm just going to make sure

42:31.000 --> 42:32.000
we've unlocked all the way

42:32.000 --> 42:33.000
shortcut things along the way,

42:33.000 --> 42:34.000
because...

42:36.000 --> 42:38.000
Once you take hold of Sotun

42:38.000 --> 42:39.000
with mm-mm-mm-mm,

42:39.000 --> 42:40.000
you can push a pill

42:40.000 --> 42:42.000
that should be extremely important.

42:42.000 --> 42:44.000
So I hope you take these pointers.

42:44.000 --> 42:45.000
There you go.

42:45.000 --> 42:46.000
I will.

42:46.000 --> 42:48.000
I'm taking the pointers.

42:52.000 --> 42:53.000
There we go.

42:53.000 --> 42:54.000
Sorry.

42:54.000 --> 42:55.000
I'm having a stroke there.

42:55.000 --> 42:56.000
Hold on a minute.

42:56.000 --> 42:57.000
Use it to unlock the doors.

42:57.000 --> 42:58.000
Absolutely.

43:00.000 --> 43:01.000
2D Zelda game

43:01.000 --> 43:03.000
didn't really change anything.

43:03.000 --> 43:04.000
I already...

43:04.000 --> 43:06.000
I pushed that, but it reset.

43:10.000 --> 43:12.000
They announced a new 2D Zelda game

43:12.000 --> 43:13.000
where you play as Zelda.

43:13.000 --> 43:14.000
Okay, wait.

43:14.000 --> 43:15.000
Maybe I will have to check out

43:15.000 --> 43:16.000
Nintendo Direct,

43:16.000 --> 43:18.000
because if it's cute,

43:18.000 --> 43:20.000
but it's kawaii-nee,

43:20.000 --> 43:22.000
they've got me in a choke hole.

43:22.000 --> 43:24.000
I can't believe the stereotype

43:24.000 --> 43:25.000
of girls playing games

43:25.000 --> 43:27.000
because they're cute is real.

43:27.000 --> 43:29.000
You found the dungeon map.

43:30.000 --> 43:32.000
Okay, let's go.

43:34.000 --> 43:35.000
Now what?

43:35.000 --> 43:36.000
Oh, we got...

43:36.000 --> 43:38.000
Oh, did I just swap that around?

43:41.000 --> 43:42.000
I'll survive.

43:44.000 --> 43:45.000
It's Ogre, the new Zelda.

43:45.000 --> 43:47.000
Literally, these gender norms have hands.

43:48.000 --> 43:49.000
I can't believe it.

43:49.000 --> 43:51.000
What do you mean I'm only going to play a game

43:51.000 --> 43:52.000
because it's cute?

43:52.000 --> 43:53.000
What do you mean that

43:53.000 --> 43:55.000
Viva Pina is the most adorable thing

43:55.000 --> 43:57.000
and they should remaster it?

43:58.000 --> 44:00.000
They're just the perfect little...

44:00.000 --> 44:01.000
Open...

44:01.000 --> 44:02.000
Open...

44:02.000 --> 44:03.000
Cuman.

44:05.000 --> 44:06.000
What's the plan?

44:06.000 --> 44:07.000
What's up here?

44:07.000 --> 44:08.000
Is there something up here?

44:08.000 --> 44:09.000
Is there something down there?

44:09.000 --> 44:10.000
Is there something for everyone?

44:10.000 --> 44:11.000
Right.

44:11.000 --> 44:12.000
Will we go that way first?

44:13.000 --> 44:15.000
We'll go down first since this...

44:17.000 --> 44:18.000
I like how they were like,

44:18.000 --> 44:20.000
no, you're not going to lose any health

44:20.000 --> 44:22.000
for not being able to judge the...

44:23.000 --> 44:24.000
the distance.

44:28.000 --> 44:30.000
Nice to see you play a classic.

44:30.000 --> 44:31.000
Yeah.

44:31.000 --> 44:33.000
I'm like trying to do

44:33.000 --> 44:35.000
one childhood game

44:35.000 --> 44:37.000
so I can show you guys

44:37.000 --> 44:39.000
like how I'm cultured.

44:41.000 --> 44:42.000
Oh!

44:42.000 --> 44:44.000
I actually lost some health for once.

44:49.000 --> 44:51.000
So you need to move this one out of me.

44:54.000 --> 44:56.000
Yes, I'm trying to do at least one

44:56.000 --> 44:58.000
childhood game every week.

44:58.000 --> 44:59.000
Did I say a month?

44:59.000 --> 45:00.000
I think I might have said a month.

45:00.000 --> 45:02.000
Every week type thing.

45:02.000 --> 45:03.000
This is just exciting.

45:04.000 --> 45:05.000
You...

45:05.000 --> 45:07.000
The one thing I like about this game

45:07.000 --> 45:08.000
is you can spam the sword

45:08.000 --> 45:09.000
and nothing can hit you

45:09.000 --> 45:11.000
because they have to bounce back.

45:11.000 --> 45:12.000
It's actually a really good design.

45:12.000 --> 45:13.000
I'm sorry.

45:13.000 --> 45:14.000
I said it.

45:14.000 --> 45:15.000
It's a really good design.

45:15.000 --> 45:16.000
Okay, we've got Pina.

45:17.000 --> 45:18.000
Any Halo players?

45:18.000 --> 45:19.000
Absolutely.

45:19.000 --> 45:21.000
So a Halo campaign

45:21.000 --> 45:23.000
can be played multiplayer,

45:23.000 --> 45:25.000
which I'm interested about

45:25.000 --> 45:28.000
possibly grabbing some worlds for.

45:28.000 --> 45:30.000
I don't know

45:30.000 --> 45:33.000
if I'll need to hunt for each of them.

45:33.000 --> 45:35.000
That play Halo or maybe.

45:36.000 --> 45:38.000
Azura really surprised me.

45:40.000 --> 45:42.000
Oh, there's a heart.

45:45.000 --> 45:47.000
I got freaking jumped here.

45:49.000 --> 45:50.000
See you, you wee bam.

45:50.000 --> 45:51.000
Oh, fuck I missed.

45:51.000 --> 45:52.000
Sorry, hold on.

45:52.000 --> 45:54.000
See you, you wee bam.

45:55.000 --> 45:56.000
There.

45:58.000 --> 45:59.000
Right, I'm pretty sure

45:59.000 --> 46:00.000
we get this weapon in here.

46:00.000 --> 46:02.000
So I want to go in here.

46:03.000 --> 46:05.000
It's Black Ops to the childhood game.

46:05.000 --> 46:07.000
I'd say Black Ops one hour.

46:08.000 --> 46:09.000
Oh my god, maybe.

46:10.000 --> 46:11.000
So this wiggly worm,

46:11.000 --> 46:12.000
he becomes enraged,

46:12.000 --> 46:14.000
but don't worry.

46:14.000 --> 46:16.000
You just need a boofy snoop.

46:16.000 --> 46:17.000
I just got booped in.

46:17.000 --> 46:18.000
Aha, you know that.

46:19.000 --> 46:20.000
And you need to hit his butt.

46:21.000 --> 46:22.000
Take this.

46:22.000 --> 46:23.000
Take his spanking.

46:26.000 --> 46:27.000
And he just runs around

46:27.000 --> 46:28.000
like a wiggly worm.

46:28.000 --> 46:29.000
And he spank his nose.

46:30.000 --> 46:32.000
And then you go get his boinkins.

46:33.000 --> 46:34.000
Spank that boink.

46:37.000 --> 46:38.000
And now

46:39.000 --> 46:41.000
we have the gust jar.

46:41.000 --> 46:43.000
Hold the button to draw things in

46:43.000 --> 46:45.000
and release to fire them out.

46:46.000 --> 46:48.000
Set it to air B in the tail screen.

46:48.000 --> 46:50.000
So the one thing that's a bit

46:50.000 --> 46:52.000
hard about this game

46:52.000 --> 46:54.000
is there should be a heart down here.

46:54.000 --> 46:55.000
Yes!

46:56.000 --> 46:57.000
I got a piece of heart.

46:57.000 --> 46:59.000
I only need two more.

46:59.000 --> 47:01.000
And I think there's one more in here.

47:03.000 --> 47:05.000
I mean, I guess we could open up this,

47:05.000 --> 47:06.000
but I just don't like doing anything.

47:06.000 --> 47:08.000
Give him the souk jar.

47:09.000 --> 47:10.000
Now

47:11.000 --> 47:13.000
I don't know what one it is.

47:13.000 --> 47:14.000
Oh, there it is.

47:15.000 --> 47:17.000
Yeah, you can like find hidden things.

47:17.000 --> 47:19.000
Ten mysterious shells.

47:19.000 --> 47:21.000
We don't know what the shells are for yet.

47:22.000 --> 47:23.000
Oh, I don't know.

47:24.000 --> 47:26.000
So all those tiles that are like dusty

47:27.000 --> 47:28.000
basically

47:29.000 --> 47:30.000
we want to clean them up

47:30.000 --> 47:32.000
because I think they give like hidden

47:32.000 --> 47:33.000
rewarding stuff.

47:34.000 --> 47:35.000
But we can just do it like that.

47:35.000 --> 47:36.000
It's up.

47:39.000 --> 47:41.000
Oh, we've unlocked a portal to that heart.

47:41.000 --> 47:42.000
That's so good.

47:42.000 --> 47:44.000
Okay, so when they have no dust on them,

47:44.000 --> 47:45.000
they're vulnerable.

47:45.000 --> 47:47.000
When they have no dust on them,

47:47.000 --> 47:48.000
they're vulnerable.

47:52.000 --> 47:53.000
Did we get anything

47:53.000 --> 47:55.000
if we could perish them all in this room though?

47:58.000 --> 47:59.000
No, we didn't.

48:01.000 --> 48:03.000
I think there's a chest under this one

48:03.000 --> 48:04.000
because look at the fireplace.

48:04.000 --> 48:06.000
Yeah, look at the fireplace, man.

48:06.000 --> 48:09.000
The game like literally screaming in your face

48:09.000 --> 48:11.000
like there's something hidden here.

48:11.000 --> 48:13.000
Please look for it.

48:13.000 --> 48:15.000
Okay, I don't think we have to do them all.

48:16.000 --> 48:18.000
I guess super suck.

48:19.000 --> 48:20.000
Can I suck them?

48:20.000 --> 48:21.000
Oh, I can.

48:23.000 --> 48:24.000
Man, push it.

48:30.000 --> 48:32.000
Now there's a puzzler.

48:32.000 --> 48:34.000
I suspect there's not much more we can do here right now.

48:34.000 --> 48:35.000
Let's press on.

48:35.000 --> 48:38.000
Perhaps we can work this from another angle later on.

48:38.000 --> 48:40.000
So the game, right, I got a bit...

48:40.000 --> 48:41.000
Wait, wait, wait.

48:41.000 --> 48:42.000
Can I touch that chest?

48:42.000 --> 48:44.000
Sorry, let me touch that chest.

48:44.000 --> 48:45.000
I never even tried.

48:47.000 --> 48:49.000
The game is very nice.

48:49.000 --> 48:50.000
Yeah, okay, we can touch it.

48:50.000 --> 48:51.000
Listen here then.

48:51.000 --> 48:52.000
I thought remember.

48:53.000 --> 48:54.000
You got a compass.

48:54.000 --> 48:56.000
Use it to find locations of hidden items.

48:58.000 --> 49:00.000
I don't remember this in childhood.

49:01.000 --> 49:02.000
Oh!

49:03.000 --> 49:04.000
Wow, big.

49:05.000 --> 49:06.000
Big, big, big, big.

49:06.000 --> 49:08.000
Okay, head up back out.

49:09.000 --> 49:10.000
Okay, just start again.

49:12.000 --> 49:14.000
I almost certainly touched the chest.

49:14.000 --> 49:16.000
A new hand touches the chest.

49:19.000 --> 49:21.000
Do you want to touch the chest?

49:21.000 --> 49:22.000
Wow!

49:22.000 --> 49:25.000
Oh, I will say one thing about these older games.

49:25.000 --> 49:30.000
It hurts my soul when you, like,

49:30.000 --> 49:34.000
defeat the enemies, but they don't stay defeated.

49:35.000 --> 49:37.000
That's the only thing that hurts me.

49:38.000 --> 49:40.000
Okay, we've got our mysterious shells.

49:40.000 --> 49:44.000
Oh, mysterious shells.

49:45.000 --> 49:46.000
Wait, wait.

49:47.000 --> 49:50.000
No, we need to fall down in here.

49:53.000 --> 49:56.000
Are you ready for Lily Padling?

49:59.000 --> 50:01.000
Can I hurt you from here?

50:01.000 --> 50:02.000
I can!

50:02.000 --> 50:04.000
The game actually registers as a different height.

50:05.000 --> 50:06.000
No war.

50:06.000 --> 50:09.000
Unless you find a way to travel by water,

50:09.000 --> 50:11.000
we want to be going much farther.

50:11.000 --> 50:14.000
We are now going down Lily Pad Lover's Lane.

50:15.000 --> 50:16.000
And then I just pop it.

50:20.000 --> 50:23.000
I'm actually surprised the game registers height like that.

50:23.000 --> 50:25.000
I thought I could kill that, but I don't know.

50:26.000 --> 50:27.000
I can't believe it.

50:27.000 --> 50:29.000
They actually made a quality game.

50:31.000 --> 50:34.000
I don't know how close they need to be.

50:34.000 --> 50:35.000
Yeah, there we go.

50:36.000 --> 50:43.000
Um, I think it's just a reward if we go this way.

50:46.000 --> 50:48.000
Oh, no, it's not.

50:48.000 --> 50:49.000
There's a key.

50:49.000 --> 50:50.000
We need a key, but we don't have it.

50:50.000 --> 50:52.000
Lover's Boatwright Destroyer.

50:52.000 --> 50:55.000
Literally, we're on Lily Pad Lover's Lane or something.

50:55.000 --> 50:59.000
All the raids are always called that Lover's Lane.

51:00.000 --> 51:03.000
It comes to those romantical ones.

51:03.000 --> 51:05.000
A bit romantical.

51:06.000 --> 51:08.000
Right, this one.

51:09.000 --> 51:11.000
Oh, I could probably actually use that one.

51:11.000 --> 51:12.000
Oh, Lover.

51:13.000 --> 51:15.000
We just need a classic pot on the switch.

51:16.000 --> 51:17.000
Very good game.

51:19.000 --> 51:22.000
Yeah, like, see how I wasn't even facing that enemy,

51:22.000 --> 51:24.000
but the game was still like, yeah, you got him.

51:25.000 --> 51:27.000
Have I got my blank?

51:28.000 --> 51:30.000
Ah, my blank is not here.

51:31.000 --> 51:33.000
I'm gonna have to come back.

51:33.000 --> 51:35.000
I'm gonna have to go get him.

51:36.000 --> 51:37.000
Because I'm hurting my leg.

51:37.000 --> 51:38.000
I'm killing the circulation.

51:38.000 --> 51:40.000
Oh, this is not looking good.

51:41.000 --> 51:42.000
Got a small key.

51:42.000 --> 51:45.000
Yeah, you don't have to specify it small

51:45.000 --> 51:46.000
every time you talk about it, okay?

51:46.000 --> 51:48.000
I'm starting to feel personally attacked

51:48.000 --> 51:50.000
and I don't even have any in there.

51:51.000 --> 51:53.000
And the game cannot stop.

51:54.000 --> 51:55.000
Yay.

51:56.000 --> 51:57.000
Set properly.

51:57.000 --> 51:59.000
Literally, my legs are against the table

51:59.000 --> 52:00.000
and it's caught in circulation.

52:00.000 --> 52:01.000
I should take a picture of my legs

52:01.000 --> 52:03.000
to show you how severe it is.

52:04.000 --> 52:06.000
I'll maybe do that.

52:08.000 --> 52:09.000
Oh!

52:09.000 --> 52:10.000
Link.

52:11.000 --> 52:12.000
Buddy.

52:12.000 --> 52:13.000
Buddy.

52:15.000 --> 52:17.000
Small key to go with that

52:17.000 --> 52:19.000
embarrassingly small shield.

52:19.000 --> 52:21.000
Literally, I was like, wait a minute.

52:21.000 --> 52:23.000
This is the dialogue I was...

52:24.000 --> 52:25.000
Oh!

52:25.000 --> 52:27.000
I thought, I thought, I was just like,

52:27.000 --> 52:28.000
have I done that wrong?

52:28.000 --> 52:30.000
No, I can suck on this.

52:33.000 --> 52:34.000
Oh, dude.

52:36.000 --> 52:37.000
What did we get?

52:37.000 --> 52:39.000
You got the big key.

52:40.000 --> 52:41.000
Oh, thank you, game.

52:41.000 --> 52:42.000
You're so nice.

52:42.000 --> 52:44.000
Thank you for complimenting me.

52:44.000 --> 52:45.000
I appreciate it.

52:45.000 --> 52:47.000
Oh, we can get that other heart piece.

52:50.000 --> 52:51.000
I think I got it.

52:52.000 --> 52:54.000
Okay, let's grab that now.

52:54.000 --> 52:56.000
See, if I grabbed that one at the freaking start,

52:56.000 --> 52:58.000
we would have had a new heart container.

52:59.000 --> 53:02.000
Link is the reason there's a main-the-gap scene.

53:04.000 --> 53:08.000
I don't really remember if it's left or right.

53:09.000 --> 53:11.000
Oh, oh, it doesn't matter.

53:12.000 --> 53:14.000
We got 20 rupees!

53:14.000 --> 53:15.000
We're rich!

53:15.000 --> 53:16.000
We're rich!

53:17.000 --> 53:18.000
Gold!

53:18.000 --> 53:19.000
We're rich.

53:20.000 --> 53:21.000
Okay.

53:22.000 --> 53:24.000
That's an impressive amount of suction.

53:25.000 --> 53:26.000
Thanks!

53:28.000 --> 53:30.000
I'm sure if I was more awake,

53:30.000 --> 53:33.000
I could probably do something right now.

53:34.000 --> 53:35.000
Was that a joke?

53:36.000 --> 53:37.000
Oh, wait!

53:37.000 --> 53:38.000
Something, something, suck.

53:39.000 --> 53:40.000
Oh, wait!

53:41.000 --> 53:43.000
Oh, no, it didn't open up my little sound thing.

53:43.000 --> 53:44.000
You guys can't hear it.

53:44.000 --> 53:45.000
Hold on.

53:46.000 --> 53:47.000
Hold on, hold on.

53:47.000 --> 53:48.000
Let me open it up.

53:48.000 --> 53:49.000
Sorry, sorry.

53:49.000 --> 53:51.000
Something, something, suck.

53:52.000 --> 53:53.000
Oh, thank you.

53:53.000 --> 53:54.000
Thank you.

53:54.000 --> 53:55.000
Thank you.

53:55.000 --> 53:56.000
You're far too kind.

53:57.000 --> 54:00.000
Right, you ready for first boss fight?

54:04.000 --> 54:05.000
Wow, that was really funny.

54:05.000 --> 54:06.000
Yes, exactly.

54:07.000 --> 54:08.000
No, please laugh.

54:09.000 --> 54:10.000
Wow!

54:10.000 --> 54:12.000
It's a little slamer.

54:13.000 --> 54:15.000
Right, you ready for first boss fight?

54:16.000 --> 54:17.000
Can we do it?

54:19.000 --> 54:20.000
Oh, no.

54:21.000 --> 54:23.000
He's coming through into the temple.

54:33.000 --> 54:35.000
So you have to suck his bottom.

54:40.000 --> 54:43.000
And then he'll get a wobbly head like that.

54:44.000 --> 54:46.000
And he'll follow you and like collapse on you.

54:47.000 --> 54:48.000
And then you just...

54:52.000 --> 54:53.000
Okay, and then he gets back up again.

54:54.000 --> 54:55.000
That boss literally being...

54:55.000 --> 54:57.000
Is that how I would defeat you?

54:57.000 --> 54:59.000
Just give it a little cheeky.

55:00.000 --> 55:04.000
And then he gets quite a bit strong...

55:04.000 --> 55:05.000
Oops, sorry.

55:05.000 --> 55:06.000
I pointed the wrong way there.

55:07.000 --> 55:09.000
Okay, and then, yeah.

55:09.000 --> 55:11.000
It's a really good boss fight.

55:11.000 --> 55:12.000
I think it's really...

55:12.000 --> 55:13.000
Oh!

55:16.000 --> 55:19.000
I can't hit the button any faster.

55:20.000 --> 55:22.000
I think he jumps for a bit now.

55:23.000 --> 55:24.000
You don't want to...

55:27.000 --> 55:28.000
Oh, wait, no.

55:28.000 --> 55:29.000
I think he infinitely jumps.

55:30.000 --> 55:31.000
Oh, no, he doesn't.

55:31.000 --> 55:32.000
I lied.

55:32.000 --> 55:33.000
He doesn't infinitely jump.

55:33.000 --> 55:34.000
I don't know why I thought he did.

55:35.000 --> 55:36.000
Oh, he's almost there.

55:36.000 --> 55:37.000
He's so skinny.

55:38.000 --> 55:39.000
Oh.

55:40.000 --> 55:42.000
Now, if we have done it correctly,

55:42.000 --> 55:45.000
he should be down when he foxes we had done.

55:49.000 --> 55:50.000
There we go.

55:50.000 --> 55:52.000
Spam, spam, spam!

55:53.000 --> 55:54.000
Hey!

55:54.000 --> 55:55.000
We did it!

55:55.000 --> 55:56.000
Yippee!

55:56.000 --> 55:57.000
First boss down.

56:00.000 --> 56:02.000
He'll send it to the music.

56:02.000 --> 56:03.000
Okay.

56:05.000 --> 56:06.000
Danny turned the game up.

56:12.000 --> 56:14.000
We have gained the earth.

56:14.000 --> 56:16.000
You got the earth element.

56:17.000 --> 56:21.000
The power of the earth is the source of all living things.

56:21.000 --> 56:24.000
The earth element is the embodiment of that power.

56:26.000 --> 56:27.000
Sounds like a lean acquire.

56:28.000 --> 56:30.000
You got a heart container.

56:30.000 --> 56:33.000
Your life energy has increased and has been replenished.

56:37.000 --> 56:40.000
Pushybee, strongy shoots down the slime.

56:40.000 --> 56:41.000
I just...

56:41.000 --> 56:43.000
Right, I'm happy to discuss this.

56:43.000 --> 56:47.000
No, there is absolutely no slime in development for Gen 2 or Gen 3.

56:47.000 --> 56:49.000
I have no interest in the slime.

56:49.000 --> 56:52.000
Slimes are incredibly hard to design.

56:52.000 --> 56:55.000
Like, if you think of Sue from Monster Musume and all of that,

56:55.000 --> 56:56.000
it's just...

56:56.000 --> 56:57.000
There's nothing to it.

56:57.000 --> 56:59.000
There's nothing fun about it.

56:59.000 --> 57:00.000
Just any...

57:00.000 --> 57:02.000
Now, for a Halloween outfit, sure.

57:02.000 --> 57:05.000
The girls can go nuts if they all want to slime variations.

57:05.000 --> 57:08.000
Sure, knock yourself out because there's going to be nothing to it.

57:08.000 --> 57:10.000
Ah, we've got the earth element.

57:11.000 --> 57:13.000
We've got the earth element.

57:13.000 --> 57:15.000
You must go and tell the elder at once.

57:17.000 --> 57:21.000
Unfortunately, I don't think we can come back and get this heart until later,

57:21.000 --> 57:22.000
which is fine.

57:22.000 --> 57:24.000
It's not actually a big deal.

57:25.000 --> 57:27.000
But I know for a fact I'm going to forget it's there.

57:27.000 --> 57:28.000
And then I'm going to be like,

57:28.000 --> 57:30.000
Eh, where are all these hearts hiding?

57:32.000 --> 57:33.000
That doesn't...

57:33.000 --> 57:35.000
Okay, well, we'll have to do that then.

57:36.000 --> 57:38.000
Yeah, so there's no slime in production.

57:39.000 --> 57:41.000
So, you have found the earth element.

57:42.000 --> 57:48.000
You are blessed with much courage and strength for once young.

57:48.000 --> 57:49.000
If you are...

57:49.000 --> 57:52.000
If you are conviction and strong,

57:52.000 --> 57:54.000
head to Mount Crennel.

57:55.000 --> 58:00.000
There, you will find a man named Meliari among all of the Minish.

58:00.000 --> 58:03.000
There is no one more able to repair your sword.

58:03.000 --> 58:05.000
If you ask him,

58:05.000 --> 58:10.000
I am certain you will reforge your broken pecorri blade.

58:10.000 --> 58:13.000
I shall send the world to him in advance.

58:14.000 --> 58:16.000
Travel safely, you are brave,

58:16.000 --> 58:20.000
but there are so many evil in the world.

58:21.000 --> 58:24.000
I'm so sorry if there's any French.

58:24.000 --> 58:26.000
Désolé, Français.

58:27.000 --> 58:28.000
People.

58:30.000 --> 58:32.000
If you screw the door here,

58:32.000 --> 58:34.000
it will take you out of the forest.

58:36.000 --> 58:38.000
Great Eldor, we are in your debt.

58:38.000 --> 58:40.000
We shall head for Mount Crennel at once.

58:41.000 --> 58:42.000
Oh, excuse me.

58:42.000 --> 58:44.000
Sorry, excuse me.

58:44.000 --> 58:46.000
Oh my God!

58:46.000 --> 58:48.000
Oh my God, we need to...

58:48.000 --> 58:50.000
We need to make our village like

58:50.000 --> 58:53.000
hobbit and Minish related and

58:53.000 --> 58:55.000
like this is so cute.

58:55.000 --> 58:57.000
Imagine everyone had their own bedroom

58:57.000 --> 58:59.000
and then like one by one I come and wake you up

58:59.000 --> 59:01.000
and maybe not wake you up

59:01.000 --> 59:03.000
but just in my room.

59:04.000 --> 59:06.000
Alright, what's going on in this mushroom?

59:06.000 --> 59:07.000
Hi!

59:07.000 --> 59:08.000
Hello!

59:08.000 --> 59:10.000
Green clothes

59:10.000 --> 59:12.000
and a mystical eye.

59:14.000 --> 59:15.000
Can we hear Brian?

59:18.000 --> 59:21.000
I'm one of the reeflings you beat in Connect 4,

59:21.000 --> 59:22.000
so I'm dumb,

59:22.000 --> 59:24.000
but I'll catch up tonight either way.

59:24.000 --> 59:26.000
Enjoy it strongly.

59:26.000 --> 59:29.000
The members stream is a tier list.

59:29.000 --> 59:31.000
It's not like any game player or anything.

59:31.000 --> 59:34.000
Thank you, Tiny Spiny, for the tip.

59:34.000 --> 59:35.000
I appreciate it.

59:36.000 --> 59:37.000
Strongie is so anti-slim

59:37.000 --> 59:40.000
because she wants to turn herself into a slim cutfish.

59:40.000 --> 59:43.000
Just feel like reeflings look so slim now.

59:43.000 --> 59:45.000
Green clothes and a mystical hat.

59:45.000 --> 59:47.000
Sir, would you have a chance to be linked,

59:47.000 --> 59:49.000
the one who found the earth element?

59:49.000 --> 59:50.000
Surely you are.

59:50.000 --> 59:52.000
I've heard so many tales about you.

59:52.000 --> 59:54.000
I am Belary,

59:54.000 --> 59:56.000
researcher of antiques.

59:56.000 --> 59:59.000
I am also, oh well, a bit of an inventor.

59:59.000 --> 01:00:02.000
You know, you won't be able to get back to your town

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:04.000
due to all the debris.

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:07.000
Here, I have something that might come in handy.

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:11.000
Bomb bag!

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:14.000
And it has 10 bombs in it.

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:16.000
Now you can blow up lots of stuff.

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:19.000
For free?

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:22.000
Let me know if you find it useful.

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:24.000
Sure, thank you so much.

01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:25.000
That was so kind of you.

01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:26.000
I appreciate that.

01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:29.000
I now have Bomba.

01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:31.000
The child now has access to C4.

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:33.000
We will check these.

01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:35.000
Holder of the Sacred Powers.

01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:37.000
We grant you the power of wind.

01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:40.000
Well, it blew up.

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:43.000
Hey kid, look where that stone marker used to be.

01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:47.000
There's some strange symbol on the ground.

01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:49.000
Yes, of course, why this must be...

01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:52.000
Well, I haven't the foggy, to be honest with you.

01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:56.000
We will learn later what that does.

01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:58.000
If I go up, what's up?

01:00:58.000 --> 01:00:59.000
Minish stuff.

01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:01.000
Minish stuff, don't mind me.

01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:02.000
We are not ready.

01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:04.000
So we're going to equip our Chicky Bomb.

01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:06.000
Chicky Bomb de la.

01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:08.000
We cannot use our sword against that,

01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:11.000
so we're just going to have our freakin' C4 out.

01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:15.000
Um...

01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:19.000
Where did you come from?

01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:25.000
I can't remember what's over here.

01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:27.000
So let's go for it.

01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:30.000
Oh, Bomba.

01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:36.000
Okay, what's in here?

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:42.000
Thank you, Meat Man 53, for becoming a Mimble.

01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:44.000
Hello.

01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:46.000
Hey, look at this Kinstone piece.

01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:48.000
Have you ever seen one like this?

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:49.000
What?

01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:51.000
You don't know what a Kinstone piece is?

01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:52.000
Well, I'll tell you what.

01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:54.000
Why don't you come back and see me when you get one, okay?

01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:57.000
Okay, we need to go into town

01:01:57.000 --> 01:02:01.000
and unlock Kinstone pieces next.

01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:04.000
And then we'll come back to this nice little...

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:06.000
Oh, there's a Bomba.

01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:08.000
There's a lot of things that need bombs.

01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:09.000
Holy crap.

01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:11.000
They were like, yeah, you unlock bombs now?

01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:13.000
Oh, there's bats!

01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:17.000
I don't want it to hurt me.

01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:18.000
I got 20.

01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:20.000
Whoa.

01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:23.000
Mysterious shells.

01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:28.000
I don't want to fight those guys because they're stinky.

01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:32.000
I will bomb this though, just so we have access to the path.

01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:34.000
Oh, you know what?

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:35.000
Well, we're here.

01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:36.000
We're actually at the start of the forest.

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:37.000
I'm going to pick up that other heart

01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:39.000
because that will be our fifth heart container.

01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:41.000
Sorry, sorry.

01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:43.000
I know I'm backtracking better than I know.

01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:44.000
I know, I'm sorry.

01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:46.000
Hey, you forgive me?

01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:48.000
Oh, I just made that fall off.

01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:49.000
What was up here again?

01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:50.000
I already forgot.

01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:52.000
Did I even check?

01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:54.000
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:55.000
Can't swim yet.

01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:56.000
Can't swim.

01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:57.000
That comes later.

01:02:57.000 --> 01:03:01.000
We'll very quickly grab the heart of...

01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:03.000
Peter, Andre, Jumpscare.

01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:05.000
Was that his song?

01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:06.000
Like, Mysterious Girl.

01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:07.000
I remember...

01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:09.000
Right, this is just so British, yeah?

01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:12.000
So if you have no idea who Peter, Andre, or Katie price is.

01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:13.000
Ta-da!

01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:15.000
We now have five heart stones.

01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:17.000
That's magnificent.

01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:18.000
Magnificent.

01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:24.000
This game only has four dungeons, right?

01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:28.000
Yeah, we are technically one fourth of the way through the game.

01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:30.000
Because once you pick up all the elements,

01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:33.000
things go very quickly after that.

01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:35.000
Like, very, very quickly.

01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:38.000
Okay, we are now going to hit the town, boys.

01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:47.000
And now that we have a sword,

01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:50.000
we can clear out any stuff that's in the way.

01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:53.000
High rule town, so it's no longer in celebration mode.

01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:54.000
Oh.

01:03:58.000 --> 01:03:59.000
Come one, come all!

01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:02.000
See how many kingstone pieces you can collect.

01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:05.000
You never know what fusing kingstones will do,

01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:06.000
but it's sure to be good.

01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:09.000
Come on up and get your free kingstone bag

01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:11.000
for holding your kingstone pieces.

01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:13.000
Don't miss out on this incredible

01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:15.000
once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:19.000
Yes, yes, you're here for your free kingstone bag, aren't you?

01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:21.000
That's right, maybe you didn't hear me,

01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:24.000
but they're free for all kids right now.

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:27.000
You got king, kingstone bag.

01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:28.000
You can now carry kingstone pieces,

01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:30.000
so we're going to go back to that other one.

01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:32.000
This guy looks like a scumbazer.

01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:36.000
Fitting two kingstone pieces together

01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:38.000
is called kingstone fusion.

01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:40.000
If you get two pieces to fit perfectly,

01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:43.000
great happiness will come your way.

01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:45.000
I'll put the kingstone pieces in your kingstone bag

01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:47.000
so you can give it...

01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:49.000
If I read kingstone one more time, you're done.

01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:50.000
You're done.

01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:51.000
Nah, I'm not reading that.

01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:53.000
Anyone who's willing to fuse the stones

01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:55.000
would look like how I do.

01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:56.000
When you see that look in their eyes,

01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:59.000
that's when you press the left trigger.

01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:02.000
Use to choose the kingstone pieces

01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:04.000
and press this button.

01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:05.000
Did you catch all of that?

01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:07.000
Yes, do not ever repeat that again.

01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:08.000
Yes.

01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:11.000
Then stand in front of me and press E.

01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:14.000
Yes, yes, that's it. Press E.

01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:16.000
What does it do?

01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:17.000
The pieces fit together.

01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:19.000
Maybe something good will happen.

01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:23.000
Free kidney stones?

01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:25.000
Wow, where's that?

01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:28.000
I think that's bottom right of our house.

01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:30.000
So we'll give it a little check.

01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:31.000
We'll give it a check.

01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:32.000
It is bottom right of our house.

01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:33.000
I knew it. I knew it.

01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:34.000
I recognise it.

01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:35.000
A perfect fit.

01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:37.000
That means we're both dudes for happiness soon.

01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:38.000
I'll see you.

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:39.000
Okay.

01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:45.000
Now, in order to acquire these pieces,

01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:49.000
you basically just get them naturally

01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:52.000
from cutting grass and stuff

01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:54.000
and doing your chores.

01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:56.000
They appear out of the bushes.

01:05:56.000 --> 01:05:58.000
And you can buy them in a shop as well.

01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:00.000
But of course, none of them are spawning.

01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:02.000
That would be far too easy.

01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:04.000
Maybe in the grass?

01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:06.000
Hello, is anyone hating the grass?

01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:09.000
Nothing is spawning.

01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:11.000
I wonder if we have to progress again a bit more.

01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:16.000
Not one piece in the grass.

01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:17.000
Oh, spider!

01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:21.000
We're fine, we're safe.

01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:23.000
Bruh.

01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:25.000
Nothing is spawning.

01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:27.000
I mean, I'm not going to say no to the rupees

01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:29.000
because we're going to have to end up buying them.

01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:30.000
They're a rare drop.

01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:31.000
Oh, we got a heart!

01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:32.000
You got a piece of a heart.

01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:35.000
Collect four to make energy.

01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:43.000
I didn't think they were that rare.

01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:44.000
Oh!

01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:45.000
There we go.

01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:46.000
These mystic stones bring happiness.

01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:47.000
Yes.

01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:48.000
I didn't think they were that rare.

01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:49.000
I think they're relative.

01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:51.000
Holder of the sacred powers,

01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:53.000
we grant you the power of the wind.

01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:54.000
Hey!

01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:55.000
Oh, sorry.

01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:56.000
You know what?

01:06:56.000 --> 01:06:57.000
No matter how many times I see that,

01:06:57.000 --> 01:06:58.000
it still rouses me

01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:00.000
because he doesn't know what the symbol is.

01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:02.000
Right, we're going to go back to that little guy

01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:04.000
because he was really excited

01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:06.000
to tell us about Kin Stones or something.

01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:08.000
Where was he?

01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:09.000
He was down here.

01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:15.000
Hi, buddy!

01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:16.000
We're back!

01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:18.000
Just like you asked.

01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:20.000
Right, what would you like to tell us

01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:22.000
about these magical Kin Stones pieces?

01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:23.000
Hello!

01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:26.000
I just planted a big old bean.

01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:27.000
It hasn't sprouted yet

01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:29.000
but when it does, I'm going to be...

01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:33.000
If it hasn't sprouted,

01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:34.000
but when it does,

01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:36.000
it's going to be a big sucker.

01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:39.000
Don't say it.

01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:40.000
Don't say it, chat.

01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:42.000
Don't say it, refunds.

01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:45.000
Okay, I guess he's telling us

01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:47.000
that the bean stalks

01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:50.000
will grow

01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:51.000
via Kin Stones.

01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:54.000
That's the only thing I can...

01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:55.000
Shut up!

01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:57.000
Wow, there's so many enemies in that area.

01:07:57.000 --> 01:07:58.000
Right, I'm not bothering.

01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:00.000
Oh!

01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:03.000
That's what I get for not paying attention.

01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:05.000
I'm just getting absolutely

01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:06.000
blasted at what it was.

01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:08.000
Is there anything else in town we can do?

01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:10.000
We might be able to speak to the martial artists.

01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:11.000
Do you know that?

01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:13.000
Hello!

01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:16.000
Oh my god, it's the wee chickadee!

01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:19.000
Oh my god, he's so cute!

01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:21.000
He's a thing.

01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:24.000
Hello?

01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:25.000
Speak.

01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:27.000
I am Swiftblade,

01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:29.000
finest swordman in all of Hyrule.

01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:31.000
If you train with me,

01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:34.000
I guarantee that you will increase your skills dramatically.

01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:36.000
So, would you like to train here?

01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:38.000
Yes, please.

01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:43.000
We shall start with the most basic of all techniques.

01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:44.000
I shall teach you

01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:46.000
the spin attack.

01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:48.000
First, press and hold your sword button.

01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:51.000
Second, build up enough power.

01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:55.000
Third, release your destructive might.

01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:57.000
That's all, young swordsman.

01:08:57.000 --> 01:08:58.000
Do you understand?

01:08:58.000 --> 01:08:59.000
Yes.

01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:01.000
Ha ha ha!

01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:02.000
Very good.

01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:04.000
You are a very quick student.

01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:07.000
But you must feel the technique,

01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:08.000
not just hear about it.

01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:11.000
That's why I will now possess your body,

01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:13.000
so as you demonstrate the technique,

01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:15.000
I call this the

01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:18.000
Swiftblade Position Technique of Training.

01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:19.000
Watch this!

01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:24.000
Position!

01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:31.000
Yeah!

01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:32.000
Phew!

01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:34.000
Now you must try it yourself.

01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:36.000
Press and hold your sword button.

01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:37.000
Build up enough power.

01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:39.000
Then release your destructive might.

01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:41.000
That's all there is to it.

01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:45.000
Yeah!

01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:47.000
Yes, fine work.

01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:48.000
You're a quick study.

01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:51.000
I will now give you this Tiger Scroll.

01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:53.000
If you ever forget this technique,

01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:55.000
you can review it with the scroll.

01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:58.000
You may view it at any time from the quest screen.

01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:00.000
You learned the secret spin attack,

01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:01.000
baiting technique.

01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:03.000
This is the first sword technique

01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:06.000
you've learned from Master Swiftblade.

01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:08.000
Right, we're going to leave and come back in

01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:10.000
because he might teach me something new

01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:12.000
because I unlocked the Earthstone.

01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:14.000
There are no more techniques I can teach you

01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:16.000
with your current sword.

01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:18.000
Okay, okay, when we upgrade your sword.

01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:21.000
This guy is treating us like the kings

01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:23.000
under a prana.

01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:25.000
Aw, that's so cute!

01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:32.000
Oh, I just remembered.

01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:33.000
If you clear this up,

01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:35.000
there should be a new guy that comes in.

01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:39.000
Aw, I think it's a kinsome guy, actually.

01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:41.000
Oh my god, there's a bakery?

01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:43.000
Oh my god, reeflings!

01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:45.000
What do you want to eat?

01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:46.000
Sniffs it?

01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:49.000
Mmm, doesn't that smell spectacular?

01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:51.000
Perhaps they give you free samples.

01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:53.000
I say, would you ask for me?

01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:55.000
Do reeflings want sandwich,

01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:57.000
a pie,

01:10:57.000 --> 01:10:58.000
a croissant,

01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:00.000
or a bread?

01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:01.000
Sand.

01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:02.000
Oh, you want sand?

01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:03.000
Okay, sand.

01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:04.000
Sand.

01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:06.000
Good morning.

01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:08.000
Uh, Ichi-sando?

01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:10.000
Please?

01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:12.000
Welcome!

01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:14.000
You've come to the one and only

01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:16.000
bakery of Wheaton & Pitter!

01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:18.000
As in, Wheat & Pitterbread?

01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:20.000
Wheat on Pitter!

01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:22.000
Whoa, you don't need to jump on her in the bakery.

01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:24.000
This tasty slice of cake,

01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:26.000
which may or may not have something special inside,

01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:28.000
it's a moist and cream filled

01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:30.000
bargain. It's only 60!

01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:34.000
I don't have 60 rupees on my...

01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:36.000
I'm a child!

01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:38.000
Jeez, how much is this then?

01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:40.000
How much is the pie?

01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:42.000
Welcome, you've come? Yeah, no, no.

01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:44.000
A slice of her fantastic fruit pie,

01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:46.000
which may or may not have something inside.

01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:47.000
40!

01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:49.000
I'm a child, lady!

01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:50.000
Jeez, Louise!

01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:53.000
Right, you guys are getting a croissant and taking it, right?

01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:55.000
Yes, yes, yes.

01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:56.000
Right, how much is a croissant?

01:11:56.000 --> 01:11:57.000
Okay, it's there.

01:11:57.000 --> 01:11:59.000
You guys can eat the croissant,

01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:00.000
sit down, shut up, and eat it,

01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:01.000
because I know you didn't want it,

01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:03.000
but you can still get it.

01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:05.000
Oh, you got a kid's stone face!

01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:07.000
Thank you, refling!

01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:09.000
Thank you for not swallowing it.

01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:11.000
I didn't really want it if it came out long ago.

01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:13.000
Hmm, hmm.

01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:15.000
Must make deliciousness.

01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:17.000
Aww, it's so cute.

01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:19.000
Did you enjoy it?

01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:20.000
I want its anger.

01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:22.000
I'm too poor, okay?

01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:24.000
Look,

01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:27.000
you gave me an entire generation.

01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:29.000
I have five kids to look after.

01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:31.000
I have reflings to look after.

01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:33.000
And I might currently be pregnant

01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:35.000
with Gen 2.

01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:37.000
I don't know yet what's happening.

01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:39.000
Uh, right.

01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:41.000
Is there anything else?

01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:44.000
The dog's in the way, so that's locked off.

01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:50.000
We can give you more generations,

01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:51.000
but my pie!

01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:53.000
I'm not money enough.

01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:54.000
I don't have enough money.

01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:55.000
What do you think?

01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:56.000
Speak.

01:12:56.000 --> 01:12:57.000
Well, if it isn't Link,

01:12:57.000 --> 01:12:59.000
it is good to see you again.

01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:00.000
The school is in session.

01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:02.000
I'm afraid I can't let you in.

01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:03.000
Oh my god, that's right.

01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:05.000
He's like a literal child

01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:07.000
going about the map health.

01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:15.000
What are you?

01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:18.000
Buggy buggy boo.

01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:19.000
Did I scare you?

01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:20.000
No.

01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:23.000
Oh, there's like this silly chicken game.

01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:24.000
Oh no, this is horrible.

01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:26.000
My cocoons have gotten out.

01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:27.000
Can you help me catch them?

01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:29.000
Try to catch two of them, please.

01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:31.000
Yoink!

01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:34.000
Get back in the pen!

01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:36.000
Okay, we only need two, so that's fine.

01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:41.000
Is that making a weird noise?

01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:43.000
It sounds like scratching.

01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:45.000
Weird.

01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:47.000
Oh, there's a golden one.

01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:48.000
I got a golden ch-

01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:49.000
Ah!

01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:50.000
Get back here!

01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:52.000
No, you're going back in your pen.

01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:54.000
Naughty chicken.

01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:56.000
Okay, time's up, that's it.

01:13:58.000 --> 01:13:59.000
Thanks, here's your reward.

01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:00.000
Ten seers-

01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:02.000
What did I do with the shells?

01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:04.000
Oh, she gave me 30 rupees.

01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:06.000
Maybe I can get your sandwich.

01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:12.000
A literal child being sent to just kill a wizard.

01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:15.000
I love those memes that are like,

01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:17.000
summarise the game in one sentence,

01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:19.000
like completely out of context.

01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:23.000
Child sent to kill wizard is pretty accurate.

01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:24.000
Alright, what do I even need to do?

01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:25.000
Sorry.

01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:28.000
I am having a fun time just giving off

01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:30.000
and enjoying this game for what it's worth.

01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:34.000
Oh!

01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:36.000
Sorry, I got a little excited looking at the water there.

01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:37.000
Oh!

01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:39.000
Bees!

01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:41.000
I don't want to take them yet

01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:43.000
because I don't have anything to put them in.

01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:47.000
There was an enemy up ahead.

01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:54.000
Next time we go back to town,

01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:56.000
I will get your cake.

01:14:56.000 --> 01:14:57.000
Even though-

01:14:57.000 --> 01:14:58.000
Oh!

01:14:58.000 --> 01:14:59.000
Well, we can't go that way.

01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:00.000
Hold on.

01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:01.000
We need to go up.

01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:06.000
Every additional chicken gets you more money

01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:07.000
even if it's for going on.

01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:08.000
Ah, okay, okay.

01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:10.000
So I should get going.

01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:11.000
Oh!

01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:12.000
He wants to do that thing.

01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:14.000
You want to fuse Kinstone?

01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:15.000
Yeah, but-

01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:17.000
Ah, I don't have what you need.

01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:20.000
What about you?

01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:23.000
I don't have what both of them needs?

01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:25.000
What are the odds of that?

01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:29.000
Now we're getting there.

01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:30.000
You fuse.

01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:31.000
You fuse.

01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:32.000
Come.

01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:33.000
Ah, come.

01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:34.000
But they aren't open yet.

01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:35.000
Hmm.

01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:38.000
Okay.

01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:39.000
Hello, can I get that?

01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:40.000
Ho, ho.

01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:41.000
So you've learned to spin attack.

01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:43.000
It's still dangerous, but maybe you can handle it.

01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:46.000
Oh, I didn't even know I needed that to progress.

01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:47.000
Yeah, that's the one.

01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:49.000
But there are monsters out there, kid.

01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:50.000
Please just be careful.

01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:53.000
I think he blocks you from going anywhere.

01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:55.000
Okay.

01:15:55.000 --> 01:15:56.000
It's two hits.

01:15:56.000 --> 01:15:57.000
That's fine.

01:15:57.000 --> 01:15:58.000
What are these?

01:15:58.000 --> 01:15:59.000
Can I break them?

01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:00.000
I can!

01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:03.000
Well, I'm not fucking picking them all up manually.

01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:04.000
Just down here.

01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:08.000
Oh, Bomba!

01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:14.000
They have got some timer on them.

01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:15.000
Hello!

01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:17.000
Oh, this is a merchant.

01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:18.000
Hold on.

01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:21.000
You need a dinkum.

01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:23.000
Okay, you got me.

01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:24.000
Let me make it up to you.

01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:25.000
You can have this.

01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:27.000
Do you have lots of bottles for 20?

01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:28.000
Sure.

01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:29.000
Give me up.

01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:30.000
You got an empty bowl.

01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:31.000
Thanks a lot.

01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:33.000
Yes, we needed the bowl for...

01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:35.000
Actually, we need...

01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:36.000
This was...

01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:38.000
I didn't even remember it was down here.

01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:41.000
We needed the bowl for...

01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:45.000
If not, we'll just have to make do with your cake instead.

01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:47.000
How the frickin...

01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:49.000
How did you guys do that?

01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:53.000
That's really coordinated.

01:16:53.000 --> 01:16:54.000
I'm sorry.

01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:56.000
That's really coordinated doing that.

01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:01.000
Here.

01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:08.000
No, literally.

01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:11.000
The only time you guys are like mega-coordinated is...

01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:12.000
What's that?

01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:13.000
Which is actually really funny.

01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:16.000
Okay, there's nothing up here that we can do yet.

01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:17.000
Reefling?

01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:18.000
Hive?

01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:19.000
Main?

01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:20.000
I can't believe it.

01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:21.000
Main broken?

01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:22.000
I'm not even spanked at the first one yet,

01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:25.000
where I get you to rename yourself for an hour or so.

01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:31.000
Okay, this is why we need water.

01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:36.000
Because it grows the beanstalk!

01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:40.000
And then we'll grab more,

01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:41.000
because I'm like,

01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:43.000
God, we're really low on bombs.

01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:45.000
I actually don't know how to get more.

01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:47.000
Sure, grab.

01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:49.000
Put this one out for now.

01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:52.000
We used our single brain cell for the forces to do.

01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:54.000
Oh, I need it.

01:17:54.000 --> 01:17:57.000
Sorry, there is a lot of menus, like, speak.

01:17:57.000 --> 01:17:58.000
Okay, you got me.

01:17:58.000 --> 01:18:00.000
I'll make it up to you.

01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:03.000
A friend of mine in the cave just east of here in the Highlands

01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:06.000
has an item if you're planning to ongoing.

01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:08.000
It won't let you get to the top,

01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:09.000
but it might just help you get started.

01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:10.000
Okay, that's fine.

01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:13.000
I need more Keith down peep heads.

01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:14.000
What?

01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:18.000
Hmm.

01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:21.000
Right, we're gonna grab this money up here.

01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:23.000
I guess like 20.

01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:24.000
Oh, we're at 40.

01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:27.000
I still don't have enough for your signage though.

01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:29.000
Look up here, nothing.

01:18:31.000 --> 01:18:33.000
Luckily, I already did that, literally.

01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:36.000
I'm doing everything in the right order by accident.

01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:41.000
Right, we can't grip the walls yet.

01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:43.000
I might just...

01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:45.000
Oh, wait, there's something hidden under these.

01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:49.000
Whoa, they hardly get affected.

01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:52.000
There's a lot of enemies in this area.

01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:54.000
Geez, whoa, wait!

01:18:56.000 --> 01:18:58.000
Is there not a hidden thing around here?

01:19:00.000 --> 01:19:01.000
Is it this?

01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:06.000
Wow, there's a lot of enemies.

01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:10.000
Is this just a secret bomb place?

01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:12.000
It looks like we should do something here.

01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:14.000
I'll just stay here.

01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:17.000
Yeah, I was gonna say, that looks so...

01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:20.000
Like, there's totally not a hidden thing here.

01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:25.000
Oh, jelly blobs.

01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:33.000
There's a question about the mysterious shells.

01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:35.000
I can't remember what they're for.

01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:38.000
Geez, I have one bomb left.

01:19:39.000 --> 01:19:41.000
Why am I going here?

01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:47.000
I think I might need to put it in the bottle.

01:19:50.000 --> 01:19:52.000
I hope you're having a good time.

01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:55.000
I'm in the middle of the hammer, I need to play childing again.

01:19:55.000 --> 01:19:59.000
Oh, I don't think jumping on a gem would feel that good on your butt, but...

01:19:59.000 --> 01:20:01.000
I guess the smaller you...

01:20:01.000 --> 01:20:03.000
So this perfectly normal looking...

01:20:03.000 --> 01:20:07.000
So this perfectly normal looking stone was another portal of the Minish world.

01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:09.000
There may be other rock portals.

01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:11.000
Keep your eyes peeled, boy.

01:20:14.000 --> 01:20:16.000
Increase your chances when going for a figurine.

01:20:16.000 --> 01:20:17.000
Oh, okay.

01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:19.000
Okay, I can't.

01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:22.000
If the enemies aren't attacking me, there's no point in...

01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:26.000
Okay, yeah, I definitely need this liquid.

01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:30.000
Why is it...

01:20:30.000 --> 01:20:35.000
You've got Mount Serial's mineral water in your bottle.

01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:36.000
It's piping hot?

01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:39.000
Hmm.

01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:46.000
Right, I'm going to detach it because I don't want to accidentally use it

01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:49.000
because I definitely have to use it for something coming up.

01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:50.000
Green mineral water.

01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:52.000
You've got acid, literally.

01:20:55.000 --> 01:20:56.000
See you, Yibi.

01:20:56.000 --> 01:20:57.000
I know you can.

01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:02.000
I only have one bomb left.

01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:03.000
I don't want to use it on...

01:21:03.000 --> 01:21:04.000
Oh, I'm sick.

01:21:05.000 --> 01:21:07.000
There's a lot of merches nearby.

01:21:07.000 --> 01:21:08.000
Hello.

01:21:08.000 --> 01:21:09.000
Okay, you got me.

01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:11.000
I'll make up to you by selling your bombs.

01:21:14.000 --> 01:21:16.000
Wait, I've only got one bomb left?

01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:20.000
Right, right.

01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:22.000
Give me the freaking bombs over.

01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:23.000
Yeah.

01:21:23.000 --> 01:21:24.000
Thanks a lot.

01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:25.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:26.000
Oh, I'm confused.

01:21:26.000 --> 01:21:27.000
I have it!

01:21:28.000 --> 01:21:31.000
The two pieces fit perfectly together.

01:21:32.000 --> 01:21:33.000
Yibi!

01:21:39.000 --> 01:21:40.000
A chest?

01:21:40.000 --> 01:21:41.000
Okay, that's fine.

01:21:42.000 --> 01:21:44.000
We do not have access to that area.

01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:46.000
Unfortunately.

01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:47.000
That's okay.

01:21:47.000 --> 01:21:50.000
I might have to start scraping by and trying to pick up coins

01:21:50.000 --> 01:21:51.000
because it's not looking good.

01:21:51.000 --> 01:21:54.000
Okay, I see they purposely put that bomb there

01:21:54.000 --> 01:21:55.000
because...

01:21:55.000 --> 01:21:56.000
Hey, that guy.

01:21:57.000 --> 01:22:00.000
Yeah, literally, they put a nice bomb cellar nearby

01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:01.000
in case you're out,

01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:02.000
and I'm like, yes, think of it.

01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:03.000
It's so smart.

01:22:05.000 --> 01:22:07.000
Oh, I don't know how far this goes.

01:22:11.000 --> 01:22:13.000
Either a lot of acid or that's plankton.

01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:19.000
Oh, I think...

01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:21.000
Once you've pulled off their iron mask,

01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:23.000
those guys are no trouble whatsoever.

01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:27.000
I think we'll just avoid them, to be honest.

01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:30.000
We don't really need to fight everything.

01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:36.000
Of course, I'm silly of me.

01:22:37.000 --> 01:22:38.000
Hey, my boy.

01:22:38.000 --> 01:22:40.000
Jump into that whirlwind over there for me.

01:22:41.000 --> 01:22:44.000
I wonder, is this a great idea or a terrible one?

01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:46.000
I'll beat the crap out of this one.

01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:52.000
Okay, now this becomes the fun part.

01:22:52.000 --> 01:22:53.000
We're really...

01:22:54.000 --> 01:22:55.000
Oh, I can't go up.

01:22:55.000 --> 01:22:56.000
Oh, there we go.

01:22:56.000 --> 01:22:57.000
I can't go up.

01:22:58.000 --> 01:22:59.000
What's...

01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:00.000
Ow!

01:23:02.000 --> 01:23:03.000
What's over here?

01:23:04.000 --> 01:23:05.000
Where's some more?

01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:06.000
Eh?

01:23:06.000 --> 01:23:07.000
There's a path.

01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:08.000
Oh, well.

01:23:08.000 --> 01:23:10.000
Tell me a bomb doesn't belong there.

01:23:11.000 --> 01:23:12.000
You can't...

01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:14.000
What's in here?

01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:18.000
Okay, I'm gonna bomb for that.

01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:24.000
Wow!

01:23:27.000 --> 01:23:29.000
It'll take us down to five bombs.

01:23:29.000 --> 01:23:31.000
Getting this, but we're gonna do it.

01:23:31.000 --> 01:23:32.000
We're gonna send it.

01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:38.000
Oh, a special Kingston piece.

01:23:38.000 --> 01:23:40.000
It was blue, so I guess...

01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:41.000
I'm 50!

01:23:41.000 --> 01:23:43.000
I can buy your sandwich even though it's a cake!

01:23:43.000 --> 01:23:44.000
But it looks like a sandwich,

01:23:44.000 --> 01:23:47.000
but it makes sense that it was a cake because it's a bakery.

01:23:48.000 --> 01:23:51.000
Leave me be, fellow beast.

01:23:55.000 --> 01:23:57.000
Okay, this one looks like a succumon.

01:23:58.000 --> 01:24:00.000
Oh, that's where the deco's!

01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:03.000
That's where the slain...

01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:06.000
I knew something had to be sucked up over here.

01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:12.000
Wow!

01:24:14.000 --> 01:24:16.000
150 rupees for a sanda.

01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:19.000
Oh, hi!

01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:20.000
See that?

01:24:20.000 --> 01:24:21.000
See how we just sucked it up,

01:24:21.000 --> 01:24:22.000
but it's already spun back in?

01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:24.000
I wish they didn't do that.

01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:25.000
Oh, wait!

01:24:25.000 --> 01:24:26.000
I can't do that yet.

01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:28.000
I need to move it.

01:24:29.000 --> 01:24:30.000
Oh!

01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:34.000
Wait, do I need to go there then?

01:24:35.000 --> 01:24:36.000
Into the hole!

01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:38.000
Okay.

01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:41.000
We're gonna do it!

01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:43.000
Oh!

01:24:43.000 --> 01:24:45.000
Sorry, I got a bit excited there.

01:24:46.000 --> 01:24:50.000
My biggest downfall in video games is just gaps.

01:24:50.000 --> 01:24:52.000
I can't do it.

01:24:53.000 --> 01:24:54.000
Who is putting this kind of shit?

01:24:54.000 --> 01:24:55.000
Wait!

01:24:57.000 --> 01:24:58.000
Oh, no.

01:24:59.000 --> 01:25:01.000
Oh, no, this can't be.

01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:09.000
I think I have missed a very detrimental item question mark.

01:25:11.000 --> 01:25:12.000
Oh, I'm done again.

01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:13.000
Sorry, sorry.

01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:14.000
There was a gap.

01:25:14.000 --> 01:25:15.000
There was a gap.

01:25:18.000 --> 01:25:26.000
I am 99.9% sure I need some sort of weight lifting thing here

01:25:26.000 --> 01:25:30.000
to move the plant over.

01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:32.000
Oh, sorry, I'm getting caught.

01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:35.000
And I don't have a...

01:25:37.000 --> 01:25:38.000
Where is it?

01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:39.000
Lift!

01:25:39.000 --> 01:25:40.000
Wait!

01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:42.000
Link!

01:25:43.000 --> 01:25:46.000
You can just straight up lift that?

01:25:46.000 --> 01:25:49.000
I thought there was some sort of item.

01:25:49.000 --> 01:25:51.000
Is that later in the game?

01:25:51.000 --> 01:25:54.000
Fuck it now, he's at time!

01:25:54.000 --> 01:25:55.000
Sorry.

01:25:55.000 --> 01:25:57.000
Oh, well, I did what I needed to do,

01:25:57.000 --> 01:26:00.000
even if I sacrificed some of my health for it.

01:26:00.000 --> 01:26:02.000
I did what needed to be done.

01:26:02.000 --> 01:26:05.000
I don't even know how he's this strong.

01:26:05.000 --> 01:26:06.000
I can't believe it.

01:26:06.000 --> 01:26:08.000
Sorry, I'm wasting all my health.

01:26:08.000 --> 01:26:13.000
Right, the reason why we need the green is this.

01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:22.000
And now we are on Mount Creronell,

01:26:22.000 --> 01:26:25.000
not to be confused with Mount Serials.

01:26:25.000 --> 01:26:27.000
I used to see as a child.

01:26:27.000 --> 01:26:29.000
I'm so funny as a child.

01:26:30.000 --> 01:26:32.000
Okay, this is definitely a bomb.

01:26:33.000 --> 01:26:36.000
Sorry, my stomach's making funky noises.

01:26:37.000 --> 01:26:38.000
Let's hear it.

01:26:39.000 --> 01:26:41.000
Weakest wiefling.

01:26:43.000 --> 01:26:45.000
Oh, no way that dodged that.

01:26:45.000 --> 01:26:47.000
That was like really good timing.

01:26:50.000 --> 01:26:51.000
I wasn't here.

01:26:51.000 --> 01:26:53.000
Another piece.

01:26:53.000 --> 01:26:54.000
Curious.

01:26:55.000 --> 01:26:56.000
Curious?

01:26:56.000 --> 01:26:57.000
Hmm, curious.

01:26:57.000 --> 01:26:58.000
Another piece.

01:26:58.000 --> 01:27:00.000
Is the game telling me I should probably trade?

01:27:00.000 --> 01:27:01.000
Whoa!

01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:03.000
New enemy unlocked.

01:27:04.000 --> 01:27:07.000
Okay, yes, I would like that heart very much, please.

01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:13.000
I should have done that in the middle.

01:27:13.000 --> 01:27:15.000
I just realized I wasted that.

01:27:15.000 --> 01:27:17.000
Bomb bomb!

01:27:17.000 --> 01:27:20.000
Oh, of course they have it in here.

01:27:25.000 --> 01:27:26.000
Oh, wait, no!

01:27:26.000 --> 01:27:28.000
I should have picked up.

01:27:28.000 --> 01:27:29.000
Silly Billy.

01:27:29.000 --> 01:27:30.000
Great.

01:27:30.000 --> 01:27:32.000
I wonder if they always won.

01:27:32.000 --> 01:27:33.000
I'm curious.

01:27:41.000 --> 01:27:46.000
Well, I still have nightmares of the snake enemies that suck your money.

01:27:46.000 --> 01:27:47.000
Give me your...

01:27:47.000 --> 01:27:49.000
Aren't those just called women?

01:27:49.000 --> 01:27:50.000
I'm sorry.

01:27:50.000 --> 01:27:53.000
I tried so hard to make that joke really quickly.

01:27:53.000 --> 01:27:54.000
It didn't work.

01:27:54.000 --> 01:27:56.000
I don't need the wool.

01:27:57.000 --> 01:28:01.000
I tried so hard to do that quickly and it completely started over my words

01:28:01.000 --> 01:28:02.000
because my brain was like,

01:28:02.000 --> 01:28:03.000
Yes, yes, the joke's there!

01:28:03.000 --> 01:28:04.000
Say it, say it!

01:28:04.000 --> 01:28:06.000
And, yeah.

01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:08.000
Well, I tried, I tried, okay, I tried.

01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:10.000
L'Bomba!

01:28:15.000 --> 01:28:16.000
Wah.

01:28:16.000 --> 01:28:18.000
Is he gonna give me the ring?

01:28:18.000 --> 01:28:20.000
Are you kidding me right now?

01:28:21.000 --> 01:28:23.000
Okay, fine, no, my money's getting sucked.

01:28:23.000 --> 01:28:24.000
Okay, you got me.

01:28:24.000 --> 01:28:26.000
I'll give you a fabulous grip ring.

01:28:26.000 --> 01:28:28.000
It is perfect for a young mountaineer.

01:28:28.000 --> 01:28:30.000
Climb 48.

01:28:30.000 --> 01:28:33.000
Okay, lucky we got money on the way.

01:28:33.000 --> 01:28:34.000
Thanks a lot.

01:28:34.000 --> 01:28:36.000
Okay, now we can climb the wall.

01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:37.000
Oh, we got five bombs again.

01:28:37.000 --> 01:28:39.000
Oh, this is perfect.

01:28:40.000 --> 01:28:41.000
Thank you.

01:28:42.000 --> 01:28:44.000
K.F.P. Spidey.

01:28:45.000 --> 01:28:46.000
Right, what way?

01:28:46.000 --> 01:28:47.000
Short cut to bomb.

01:28:47.000 --> 01:28:48.000
No, so what's up here?

01:28:50.000 --> 01:28:51.000
Oh.

01:28:55.000 --> 01:28:56.000
Oh.

01:28:57.000 --> 01:28:58.000
We can't do that.

01:29:00.000 --> 01:29:02.000
So, this is not the right way to go.

01:29:02.000 --> 01:29:04.000
Shawnee doesn't need the grip ring.

01:29:04.000 --> 01:29:05.000
She has that cover!

01:29:05.000 --> 01:29:06.000
It's the...

01:29:06.000 --> 01:29:07.000
Lip set.

01:29:07.000 --> 01:29:09.000
It's the R slash lip set grip.

01:29:10.000 --> 01:29:11.000
I'm so sorry.

01:29:11.000 --> 01:29:12.000
Wait, what?

01:29:13.000 --> 01:29:15.000
So, where am I supposed to go?

01:29:15.000 --> 01:29:16.000
Okay.

01:29:23.000 --> 01:29:24.000
Huh?

01:29:24.000 --> 01:29:26.000
Am I supposed to go to the left?

01:29:27.000 --> 01:29:28.000
I don't want to go...

01:29:28.000 --> 01:29:29.000
Okay, there.

01:29:29.000 --> 01:29:30.000
This is it.

01:29:32.000 --> 01:29:34.000
You know that subreddit?

01:29:34.000 --> 01:29:37.000
Yeah, I'm featured on it right now.

01:29:37.000 --> 01:29:40.000
I'm trolling before anyone fucking goes and knocks me in.

01:29:40.000 --> 01:29:41.000
Like, oh my god!

01:29:41.000 --> 01:29:42.000
No, no, really.

01:29:45.000 --> 01:29:46.000
Right, definitely.

01:29:48.000 --> 01:29:49.000
Ahoy!

01:29:49.000 --> 01:29:50.000
It's Emmy!

01:29:50.000 --> 01:29:51.000
Any embers?

01:29:51.000 --> 01:29:52.000
Any pen pals?

01:29:52.000 --> 01:29:53.000
Me.

01:29:59.000 --> 01:30:00.000
Please talk to me.

01:30:01.000 --> 01:30:02.000
Talk to me.

01:30:02.000 --> 01:30:03.000
Why don't you talk to me then?

01:30:04.000 --> 01:30:05.000
Wait.

01:30:05.000 --> 01:30:06.000
No!

01:30:06.000 --> 01:30:08.000
You put water in your bottle,

01:30:08.000 --> 01:30:09.000
and then you give her water.

01:30:10.000 --> 01:30:11.000
You take her water,

01:30:11.000 --> 01:30:12.000
then you give her water.

01:30:15.000 --> 01:30:16.000
Oh!

01:30:18.000 --> 01:30:20.000
Welcome to the Adventure Spring.

01:30:20.000 --> 01:30:22.000
Did you throw the golden bomb

01:30:22.000 --> 01:30:24.000
into the spring or the silver bomb?

01:30:27.000 --> 01:30:28.000
Neither?

01:30:30.000 --> 01:30:31.000
You are honest.

01:30:31.000 --> 01:30:33.000
I must reward such an honest adventure

01:30:33.000 --> 01:30:35.000
with some of my power.

01:30:35.000 --> 01:30:37.000
You got a big bomb bag!

01:30:37.000 --> 01:30:39.000
Now you can carry more bombah!

01:30:39.000 --> 01:30:41.000
Thank you, mysterious lady.

01:30:41.000 --> 01:30:43.000
May light shine on your quest.

01:30:44.000 --> 01:30:46.000
Oh, she's so ethereal.

01:30:47.000 --> 01:30:48.000
I love her.

01:30:50.000 --> 01:30:52.000
This song sounds so familiar.

01:30:52.000 --> 01:30:53.000
Yes, it is.

01:30:53.000 --> 01:30:55.000
It's like, pretty much the default, like...

01:30:56.000 --> 01:30:57.000
Hey, Zelda.

01:30:57.000 --> 01:30:59.000
Take her water, and give her water.

01:30:59.000 --> 01:31:01.000
She was just happy to get a bubble.

01:31:01.000 --> 01:31:03.000
They have a spring cone.

01:31:03.000 --> 01:31:05.000
She just wanted to do a spring cone.

01:31:05.000 --> 01:31:06.000
Ah!

01:31:06.000 --> 01:31:07.000
Ah!

01:31:08.000 --> 01:31:09.000
I can't believe I suck.

01:31:10.000 --> 01:31:11.000
Why is this...

01:31:12.000 --> 01:31:13.000
I got a cavern.

01:31:15.000 --> 01:31:16.000
I have a cavern.

01:31:17.000 --> 01:31:18.000
There's a cavern.

01:31:19.000 --> 01:31:20.000
I have a cavern.

01:31:21.000 --> 01:31:22.000
I have a cavern.

01:31:23.000 --> 01:31:24.000
I have a cavern.

01:31:25.000 --> 01:31:26.000
I have a cavern.

01:31:26.000 --> 01:31:40.640
I'm the Cranel, I'm the Cranel Hermit! I left the world to pursue a life of quiet reflection.

01:31:40.640 --> 01:31:46.400
You seem to be but a child and yet you climb this forbidden mountain alone. I must reward

01:31:46.400 --> 01:31:52.240
your courage with information. I have not seen a s- have you not seen strange patterned walls

01:31:52.240 --> 01:31:58.160
as you climb this mountain? No? Bombs, bombs are the- oh he's telling me to nuke the fricking walls.

01:31:58.160 --> 01:32:03.920
Yeah that's fine. The two kinstom pieces fit perfectly together, maybe something good will happen.

01:32:05.280 --> 01:32:07.360
I didn't know you could take the water from the fairy town.

01:32:08.480 --> 01:32:12.320
You learn something new every time you replay a childhood game.

01:32:12.480 --> 01:32:17.200
What? How is that good?

01:32:19.920 --> 01:32:23.280
How is that good? You've just- you've just created problems for me.

01:32:27.760 --> 01:32:30.160
Okay, those are aggressive.

01:32:32.080 --> 01:32:36.640
Ah! I don't know if I'll be able to- no I'm not gonna be able to in time, hold on.

01:32:37.280 --> 01:32:39.680
Okay, suck them off. Get in my P.O.B.

01:32:41.840 --> 01:32:48.000
Let's go. We are very high up if the- the fricking mountain top isn't even there.

01:32:49.280 --> 01:32:54.880
Oh my goodness. All right, we can't do anything, we have to go- man we gotta go small.

01:32:55.520 --> 01:32:59.440
Gotta take all off. Money? Oh is that what the golden snakes are?

01:32:59.440 --> 01:33:03.280
They got Mario and Marshmallow doing here.

01:33:08.640 --> 01:33:12.000
Oh, mushrooms-y owned by Nintendo.

01:33:15.200 --> 01:33:18.080
These raindrops are like folders of water tails kid.

01:33:18.080 --> 01:33:21.600
Watch out! If one of them hits us, it'll sting something fierce.

01:33:25.280 --> 01:33:29.120
I'm getting rolled! Another good kind, I literally need new hearts.

01:33:29.120 --> 01:33:34.320
I've only got three hearts. I'm drying them- wait can I push these? No I can't, I'm too small.

01:33:35.920 --> 01:33:39.920
I'm just a baby. I'm gonna do a marshmallow.

01:33:42.160 --> 01:33:43.760
Right, what do I need to do with this?

01:33:47.280 --> 01:33:54.240
All right, I definitely need to push it that way. Then up. Then up again. Then a cheeky.

01:33:55.120 --> 01:34:04.400
Left. Then up again. Then up again. Then a cheeky left. Then a left. Then a left.

01:34:04.400 --> 01:34:09.120
Then a left. Then a no- then a down. And then a straight ahead.

01:34:11.120 --> 01:34:19.120
Keep her going, keep her moving. Come on Link, you're so strong! You can do it! Link, you came to turn!

01:34:20.080 --> 01:34:23.120
You came to save the Princess Zelda!

01:34:31.920 --> 01:34:37.120
He's so strong. Oh, there's enemies at the bomb. Yeah, I knew it. I knew it.

01:34:42.160 --> 01:34:43.280
We'll go this way, I think.

01:34:44.240 --> 01:34:48.320
Uh, right, can I do this? No, let's do that one.

01:34:50.800 --> 01:34:57.440
Oh my god, I'm literally guessing the freaking designer there lay out before- I've even activated it.

01:34:58.480 --> 01:35:05.760
SHIT! I messed up. Oh, then he got all the way back because I messed up the last one I did.

01:35:06.720 --> 01:35:17.760
Unless? No. What? Wait, unless. Hold on, unless we're being misled. Unless we're being misled!

01:35:20.240 --> 01:35:26.400
It's your maiden smash force. I've never played it before. Should I play it before? Should I play it?

01:35:27.440 --> 01:35:32.480
Thank you for the five delay lovers. Don't think I don't know your bleeding heart.

01:35:33.040 --> 01:35:40.800
It's not a club, true name. I just think it's blood. Yes. I've never played it. I think Bayonetta.

01:35:42.480 --> 01:35:46.320
Hold on a minute. Yeah, I saw that. I saw the pots and I was like, hold on a minute.

01:35:46.320 --> 01:35:54.880
Is there pots on the other side? I think Bayonetta's in it, so I would probably play her when I play smash.

01:35:55.840 --> 01:36:02.480
Wait, why are you lip-biting to that? Is that a game? Is that a sexy game? I thought it was Nintendo.

01:36:02.480 --> 01:36:09.920
I was saying that Nintendo produced Bayonetta, which is like the most bomb shell. Is there something special in here?

01:36:11.040 --> 01:36:16.080
Why are you hiding these pots from me? Oh, there's like a bomb behind them. Okay, that's fine.

01:36:17.040 --> 01:36:19.440
I guess we need a bomb up ahead.

01:36:32.800 --> 01:36:37.120
You can manually throw bombs if you need to. Okay, I don't really want to fight because I'm

01:36:37.120 --> 01:36:43.520
pretty low health and not new health is spawning. Oh no, not another one of these, right? Okay.

01:36:46.720 --> 01:36:50.640
Down, two left, and then down.

01:36:54.400 --> 01:37:01.840
Okay, okay, okay, we're getting there. We're doing it. Then one, then up one, then left,

01:37:02.800 --> 01:37:07.600
then north, then west, then push! We did it!

01:37:07.600 --> 01:37:12.400
A scrawny can use her brain? Something.

01:37:21.600 --> 01:37:25.280
Sugar, I might start up. Hold on, let me try that again. Wait, no.

01:37:26.960 --> 01:37:31.520
Yeah, I can do it though. Okay, we did it, we did it, we did it, we did it.

01:37:32.080 --> 01:37:39.440
Anagong, a special console piece. Okay, sorry, sorry, sorry. Easy as connect for my life,

01:37:39.440 --> 01:37:45.120
honestly. Oh, we did it! Look, look, look, this is a Minish camp. We're going to the Dwarven Minish.

01:37:46.240 --> 01:37:50.080
The Dwarves of Erebor. I may be a bleeding heart now, but after that carry on,

01:37:53.120 --> 01:37:59.520
oh, you can be. I'm not like one of those streamers that kind of get uncomfortable. As long as you're

01:37:59.520 --> 01:38:03.680
happy, I'm happy. You enjoy the content and enjoy the content, you know?

01:38:07.680 --> 01:38:12.080
But yeah, you guys, guys, did you know you have an infestation out there? Yeah?

01:38:13.040 --> 01:38:20.960
Thank you for the five again, Delay Lover. Hello! Ting-a-long, tong-a-long, dig-a-long,

01:38:20.960 --> 01:38:26.960
fer-eye. Wait, they're actually Scottish? Ting-a-long, tong-a-long, dig-a-long, fer-eye,

01:38:27.040 --> 01:38:33.360
and they're Scottish? Ting-a-long, tong-a-long, dig-a-long, dig-a-long, dig-a-long,

01:38:33.360 --> 01:38:40.480
dig-a-long, fer-eye, and they're Scottish? In here? Oh my god, they have communal,

01:38:41.200 --> 01:38:47.520
they have communal bedding. Reflings, this is what I want. Oh my god, they're Scottish!

01:38:48.560 --> 01:38:54.080
Hi! Hello, everyone! Oh my god, it's the kitchen where I make all the fit for the

01:38:54.080 --> 01:38:59.760
reflings. What's that? We're having chicken again tonight? That's right, I'll let you use chicken.

01:39:02.240 --> 01:39:08.320
Are you Scottish? Wait, I think, wait, is it in here? No, this is just a smith's room.

01:39:09.280 --> 01:39:12.960
Okay, I think it might be down in here. Okay, definitely not there, that's how to progress.

01:39:12.960 --> 01:39:15.760
Hello! Hello, everyone!

01:39:18.240 --> 01:39:27.680
Green Clays, and an old hat! Sir, may you be young Link? I am Mellari, Master Smith. I hear you want

01:39:27.680 --> 01:39:33.840
me to reforge the sacred sword and help break a curse. I'll be needing that old sword, which holds

01:39:33.840 --> 01:39:41.040
the power of the elements first. Show me that broken PCORI blades. I love all this adventure,

01:39:41.600 --> 01:39:51.040
with what's with the rescuing of princesses and such. I'd be happy to reforge this thing into a

01:39:51.040 --> 01:40:00.880
brand new sacred blade for you. It'll take me a while to rework that sword. In the meantime,

01:40:00.880 --> 01:40:05.920
you should try doing the missing elements. One of them should be in the mind of the human

01:40:06.480 --> 01:40:12.320
dog. It's not far from here. All right, let's get started. Bunk!

01:40:13.360 --> 01:40:18.080
Eh, there'll probably be a wee while, Link. Let's leave him to it and find the element.

01:40:18.080 --> 01:40:22.880
Oh my god, Scotland kind of mentioned, even though it's just in the dialogue,

01:40:22.880 --> 01:40:27.440
but I'll take it Scotland mentioned. What? You're going to the mine? If you talk to the

01:40:27.440 --> 01:40:34.320
boss, I'm no storm here, but just be careful, laddie. Who goes there? Samwise! What nice name!

01:40:34.400 --> 01:40:40.480
Well, welcome to the members, gang. I'm so sorry about, please forgive me.

01:40:41.840 --> 01:40:46.000
Okay, hopefully we can get a heart in the mine. Holder of the sacred powers.

01:40:46.000 --> 01:40:52.800
We grant you the power of the elements. Wow! Hey, that stone marker crumbled,

01:40:52.800 --> 01:40:56.880
and there's another one of those symbols! You know what? No matter how many times I see this

01:40:56.960 --> 01:41:02.480
happen, it still rattles me a bit. Who's the 10 out of 12? That's a bit of a hi.

01:41:05.200 --> 01:41:10.320
Whoa! It's hot in here. Come on, let's not stand around wasting time. Find that element so we can

01:41:10.320 --> 01:41:15.760
get the heck out here. I'm going to smash these for heart. Yeah, normally the game is very forgiving

01:41:15.760 --> 01:41:21.760
and gives you what you need before you go next. Bums! What happens?

01:41:21.760 --> 01:41:26.960
Okay, hit them! Oh!

01:41:30.640 --> 01:41:32.320
Oh, so they do blow themselves up.

01:41:35.120 --> 01:41:38.240
Whoa, the bomb bag is there, eh? Where are you?

01:41:41.040 --> 01:41:44.720
Your sword won't make a dent in their thorny. Flip them over before you strike.

01:41:45.520 --> 01:41:51.440
With a shield? With a shield? I'm remembering! I'm remembering!

01:41:51.840 --> 01:41:53.520
Oh, I need the money so I can get cake.

01:41:57.840 --> 01:42:01.840
Okay, after this one, I'll call a break and I'm going to make another honey tea to help my

01:42:01.840 --> 01:42:09.760
throat, okay? But we're about to get the second element, okay? That's right, we're just so MLG

01:42:09.760 --> 01:42:16.320
poor. I knew it! He's humping me! He's humping me!

01:42:17.280 --> 01:42:22.240
Jeez, Louise! That was sheebie and a half right there.

01:42:25.760 --> 01:42:28.000
How is sheebie and a half? That's like sheebie doing it.

01:42:30.240 --> 01:42:34.080
Dude, do I upset the bombs if I do? Oh, I don't even upset the bombs.

01:42:36.000 --> 01:42:41.760
Okay, I upset the bombs when I do that. Okay, okay. Wow, more bomb back.

01:42:42.720 --> 01:42:45.760
These snakes, I hate them, literally.

01:42:50.000 --> 01:42:58.000
Oh! You know the Binding of Isaac, right? So Eddie McMuffin, the guy that made the game,

01:42:58.720 --> 01:43:07.360
Big Eddie McMuffin, he said that he was inspired by Legend of Zelda and he also mentioned...

01:43:07.680 --> 01:43:12.720
Oh! This might be where the humans who built the mines used to be around here,

01:43:12.720 --> 01:43:16.560
maybe we should hop in. Wait, what, after all this? There's nothing to be afraid of here,

01:43:16.560 --> 01:43:17.440
come on, let's go!

01:43:24.960 --> 01:43:32.800
Um, sweet jumpin' jellyfish! That was awful! Hey, kid, what are you smiling about? I knew it was

01:43:32.800 --> 01:43:38.320
madness to risk our lives in that rickety human contraption. From now on, let's just stick to

01:43:38.320 --> 01:43:48.480
our feet. Well, I mean, your feet. Um, yeah, he said that he was inspired. Isaac was inspired by

01:43:48.480 --> 01:43:56.400
Legend of Zelda and if you ever do the alt path and the mines and all that, this exactly reminds me

01:43:56.400 --> 01:44:05.280
of it. Uh, it's very... Ah, you can't go behind me, that's cheating! Let me equip my bomb buck.

01:44:06.160 --> 01:44:10.480
Just wanted to do it to get in here. I'll put my shield back on though, right, right over here.

01:44:14.560 --> 01:44:17.200
The snakes are called like, like, more like...

01:44:18.160 --> 01:44:26.960
Ooh! Wait, that bombies guys? I know I'm supposed to spank their butts, but they're kind of, they're

01:44:26.960 --> 01:44:36.240
kind of winning. Okay, hold on. Okay, two hits and they're gone. What? You're not supposed to actually

01:44:36.240 --> 01:44:43.040
charge me. I heard that roofie drop. Don't think I didn't hear that roofie drop.

01:44:43.040 --> 01:44:49.600
I'm interested. So there was a portal heading away in here. Hmm. Whenever you want me to shrink

01:44:49.600 --> 01:44:53.680
you down, just hop on there and press the button. You know the drill. Right, give me that. Oh, I

01:44:53.680 --> 01:45:01.120
thought it was a roofie. It was a hot, it was a hot. You can suck their masks away. Oh, okay, okay.

01:45:01.840 --> 01:45:07.200
Will we get an Isaac stream anytime soon? Like an Eden run? Probably Eden run, maybe on a shorter

01:45:07.280 --> 01:45:16.320
day. My dad is coming to visit. I am so tiny right now. I can't go in that, can I? I think that

01:45:16.320 --> 01:45:24.080
kills me. Okay, I'm not going there. My dad's coming home, my dad's coming home. So July,

01:45:25.760 --> 01:45:34.400
first two weeks are going to be relatively, I say relatively short streams, depending on

01:45:35.040 --> 01:45:42.160
how cool my dad is because I'm pretty loud when I stream, let's be honest. Jump down there?

01:45:43.200 --> 01:45:53.120
That seems dangerous. I do see the thing though. Okay, no, it is done there. So yes, July is kind

01:45:53.120 --> 01:45:59.840
of maybe like two to four hour streams for the first two weeks and then we just get straight

01:45:59.840 --> 01:46:06.640
back into, again, straight back into Endurance. Don't mind me. We'll be careful at these fires.

01:46:06.640 --> 01:46:12.640
They do restore health, so I'm not going to, I'm going to beat around the bush. Got a dungeon map,

01:46:12.640 --> 01:46:18.640
so if I ever get a old discombobulated and where I need to go, right, these time out, oh,

01:46:20.160 --> 01:46:24.400
I'm terribly, these time out, but they do come back. Hold on, let me aim this a bit better.

01:46:25.280 --> 01:46:29.600
Probably keeping them with the blue ones. I think the blue ones must be a vent or something. Oh my,

01:46:29.600 --> 01:46:34.560
it looks really, really hot in that lava. Trust me, me who'd literally just perish two seconds

01:46:34.560 --> 01:46:38.160
in four. Trust me, falling into that would be a bad idea. I'm sure you'd agree.

01:46:40.400 --> 01:46:43.760
Yeah, you'll find you'll be able to watch other lives consistent. Well, because I stream like a

01:46:43.760 --> 01:46:50.400
normal streamer, like, okay, thank you. Thank you for the two hours. I'm all flying now.

01:46:50.400 --> 01:46:58.160
I am. It does mean, I will say one thing, it does mean a lot of like Ace Marble plays in that.

01:46:58.160 --> 01:47:11.280
It'll be easier to make. Wait, this crumbles? Well, I need to pick it up. Pick up the booze.

01:47:12.000 --> 01:47:17.840
Oh, sorry. Oh, well, that worked out really well actually. I need to get rid of the fire.

01:47:17.840 --> 01:47:24.880
Oh, I just spanked. I missed it perfectly. Oh my God, reflings, I can get your Sango.

01:47:26.160 --> 01:47:33.040
Go away. Go away. Oh, no, I need money for a sign, bitch. Okay, then.

01:47:34.000 --> 01:47:36.000
Um.

01:47:41.840 --> 01:47:47.440
What did I do? I go all the way around? Oh, I must do. Okay, we use the worldwinds

01:47:47.440 --> 01:47:52.240
for all the way around on a big U-turn. Did you see the new Zelda trailer? Not yet, no.

01:47:52.240 --> 01:47:58.080
I would play it, but I'm pretty sure trailers get copyright. Like, I used to...

01:47:58.880 --> 01:48:08.320
Wait, did I? Oh, right, I push it all the way over. I used to think trailers and like anything

01:48:08.320 --> 01:48:14.240
gameplay related was like non-copyrightable because they like purposely make it not that way,

01:48:14.240 --> 01:48:22.000
but I've got two false copyright notifications on my Skyrim stream and on my Assassin's Creed

01:48:22.000 --> 01:48:31.200
Brotherhood stream. Oh. Um, but because it's a Skamas, I can't actually counteract it without

01:48:31.200 --> 01:48:38.320
putting like the channel at risk. So like I'm not counterclaimed or anything. Um, it just is just

01:48:38.320 --> 01:48:47.280
a bit sucky. Um, we are eating. Okay, we've changed the tracks' pathing now, so we're gonna get back

01:48:47.280 --> 01:48:55.680
in the mine cart and I'm gonna explore the mineshaft. Oh, I saw that horrible. Oh, sorry,

01:48:55.680 --> 01:49:02.000
I need shields for these guys. Yeah, yeah, yeah, take that muck. Triple... Well, double kill.

01:49:02.000 --> 01:49:03.680
Not triple, because there's not three enemies.

01:49:12.880 --> 01:49:16.400
Okay, definitely don't want to get pooped by the bats because the bats will shove you off that

01:49:16.400 --> 01:49:24.960
map. No hesitation. Aren't these kind of strikes automatic because someone sampled it? Yes, I just

01:49:24.960 --> 01:49:29.920
like, I looked it up like who claimed it because it looked like it looked like nothing from Bethesda

01:49:29.920 --> 01:49:35.120
or anything of that nature. I was like, this looks so unofficial and then I found this reddit and it

01:49:35.120 --> 01:49:39.520
was like filled with people saying that, oh god, we're hot. I didn't actually know it was down here.

01:49:39.520 --> 01:49:45.520
Can I just one more? Okay, good, good, good. Um, yeah, it was just filled with this reddit and

01:49:45.520 --> 01:49:51.280
everyone was taping the same thing. Like I was just casually playing this like game. Oh no, battle arena.

01:49:53.040 --> 01:49:59.680
Oh no, it's the spakey cane. Oh, I'm scared. Oh no, please leave me alone. Can I get the

01:49:59.680 --> 01:50:04.800
bill? Oh my god, I'm getting demolished. I'm just gonna spam. How about that? I'll just spam.

01:50:05.760 --> 01:50:11.600
I'll just spam. Okay, I win. I win, no. I win, I win.

01:50:16.480 --> 01:50:22.000
Okay, we did it. We did it, we did it. I didn't know I expected a freaking battle down there.

01:50:22.640 --> 01:50:30.160
You've got the cane of a, I am not gonna say that. This mystical rod has the power to flip

01:50:30.160 --> 01:50:36.320
things over. Use it to charge up energy and walls and fill it out. I don't, actually wait, I think I,

01:50:37.120 --> 01:50:46.320
I think it's Passy, like pacifist and not the other word. If you are British, you know exactly.

01:50:46.320 --> 01:50:52.320
Hey kid, why don't you take the cane of Passy and fire it at the hole? I mean,

01:50:52.320 --> 01:50:54.080
you never know what'll happen until you try it, right?

01:50:57.280 --> 01:51:00.880
These people living, why are you giving me a blue portal here?

01:51:01.680 --> 01:51:06.480
Ah, we can flip this over. Let's go!

01:51:08.720 --> 01:51:11.200
Oh, poor Link. He's so stressed.

01:51:13.200 --> 01:51:17.840
Strony has found the rod. Everyone run. It's too late. It's too late.

01:51:19.760 --> 01:51:21.680
I want to make sure I hit it from the right angle though.

01:51:22.560 --> 01:51:26.080
Ah, okay, okay, okay, okay. Right, let's just go straight back then. Super easy,

01:51:26.080 --> 01:51:33.200
peasy, lemon, squeezy. Oh, I tell you what we could do. We're gonna go back to the start to

01:51:33.200 --> 01:51:39.120
pick up hearts and then come right back again. There should be, hearts always regenerate like

01:51:39.120 --> 01:51:45.120
these. Yeah, let's play it nice and safe. I actually can't remember the boss fight in this one, you know that.

01:51:48.400 --> 01:51:52.960
I always remember the slime one because I used to get stuck as a child all the time.

01:51:56.160 --> 01:52:04.480
Am I supposed to flip this? No, there's no main shaft, crap. Okay, I'm to do this.

01:52:09.520 --> 01:52:18.080
Okay, okay, it's fine. It's fine, relax. Well, on earth with those spiders though, I have no idea.

01:52:20.720 --> 01:52:25.440
Or am I too small to activate them? I think I'm too small to activate the spiders, which is good.

01:52:26.560 --> 01:52:31.360
We don't want to do that because I think they take some health. Time to get flipped with some

01:52:32.960 --> 01:52:36.480
What? Oh my god.

01:52:41.120 --> 01:52:45.680
Aye, those aren't spiders anyway. I can tell you that much. Let's get out of here.

01:52:47.520 --> 01:52:49.760
Okay, and then flip the track and then let's go.

01:52:50.720 --> 01:52:58.880
I love his little... Oh, sorry, I walked into it.

01:53:05.520 --> 01:53:11.680
And then we just need to do this one like that. No.

01:53:12.080 --> 01:53:19.680
Oh, I need... Can you come here? Oh, I've done it now, haven't I?

01:53:21.680 --> 01:53:25.600
Okay, there we go, there we go. I was like, oh, we're gonna be stuck. Let's try a wee bit.

01:53:25.600 --> 01:53:27.440
Beyblades, yeah, those Beyblades.

01:53:28.880 --> 01:53:34.880
A horrendous evil nasty thing. Okay, let's get this switch in order and then we can

01:53:35.760 --> 01:53:42.800
progress. I think we're almost at the boss. I feel like we've done enough.

01:53:57.200 --> 01:54:01.920
Am I going crazy, but I can't do that because if I push that one, it blocks it.

01:54:02.320 --> 01:54:09.760
I'm going mental, right? Oh, because I'm not to push it at all. I understand. I understand from

01:54:09.760 --> 01:54:14.560
the other side. Sorry. I was like, my brain was like trying its best to figure out what on earth

01:54:14.560 --> 01:54:21.200
the game was asking for me there. I was like, pretty sure this was impossible. Yay, we're getting so

01:54:21.280 --> 01:54:24.400
many kinstones. Right, we can go this way.

01:54:32.320 --> 01:54:38.080
My booty. Okay, we'll need to try that again. Sorry, a bit of a panic there. Let's let the game

01:54:39.360 --> 01:54:41.360
do its thing, do its wee cheeky beeset.

01:54:42.160 --> 01:54:46.640
Okay, it's just the...

01:54:50.000 --> 01:54:52.640
You are wobbling a bit too quick for Malik and...

01:54:57.520 --> 01:55:00.800
Oh, I didn't have time to react. I need to move the pots out the way.

01:55:02.960 --> 01:55:09.280
Okay, let's go. There was a switch back there, which I didn't do. Hold on, I need to go back.

01:55:09.280 --> 01:55:11.040
Oh no, I can't get this switch from that side.

01:55:14.800 --> 01:55:19.120
If you could play one on one with a recently, what game would you absolutely beat as that Black Ops

01:55:19.120 --> 01:55:26.080
one? Absolutely no contest. Absolutely not one of you has a Black Ops one skill like me.

01:55:27.920 --> 01:55:35.520
Absolutely no contest. No hesitation. Oh shit, is this going to break by the time we get there?

01:55:36.080 --> 01:55:38.560
No, I don't. Thank you.

01:55:42.960 --> 01:55:49.840
Lies, you get smoke. Oh no, you do not understand. You do not understand. When I was peak like

01:55:51.440 --> 01:55:58.160
try hard sweat on like S&D, Team Deathmatch domination, you do not understand. You have no

01:55:58.160 --> 01:56:02.960
comprehension. And thank you for the tip again. What the fuck am I supposed to do? Sorry, I just...

01:56:03.520 --> 01:56:10.080
Hold on. Oh, there wasn't even anything related to things in here. Thank you for the tip again.

01:56:10.080 --> 01:56:17.040
But no, you genuinely have no comprehension how terrible you are at the game if you go against

01:56:17.040 --> 01:56:26.800
me on it. So right now, smile. As for any other game that I'm good at, Black Ops 2, I was pretty

01:56:26.880 --> 01:56:38.400
decent at. I'm pretty confident the MSC, that was pretty... I bloody enjoyed that.

01:56:44.960 --> 01:56:50.640
Can I get up? Can I get up? Yes, I can get up. On PCS, I still think I destroy on an FES.

01:56:51.280 --> 01:56:59.040
Halo terrible, halo. Oh goodness me, where am I supposed to go? Right, follow the wind. Follow

01:56:59.040 --> 01:57:09.120
the wind and follow the rocks. The rocks are putting me here. Oh wait, there's like... Ah,

01:57:09.120 --> 01:57:15.840
go back, go back, go back. There's a chest here. Cancel. Wait, oh, I can't get up there. Right,

01:57:15.840 --> 01:57:22.640
sorry, my apologies. I was diamond in Overwatch. Oh, I was terrible. Wait, I definitely cannot go

01:57:22.640 --> 01:57:30.480
past those rocks. So let's do this. I'm not very strong at Overwatch. It was... I just never

01:57:30.480 --> 01:57:40.160
got good at it. I just played it for fun. I like being a heal bot on Mercy. But unfortunately,

01:57:40.160 --> 01:57:45.440
Overwatch 2 happened and I completely fell out of love with the game, which is such a shame.

01:57:45.440 --> 01:57:50.640
But I wouldn't mind doing like a... We all play it as refling. I wouldn't mind that just casually.

01:57:50.640 --> 01:57:55.920
And I'll be screaming at you like, God, do this. Marvel, everyone was kind of dogging on it and

01:57:55.920 --> 01:58:02.320
yes, yes, haha, funny. But Marvel rivals, I believe the game's called, actually looked pretty decent.

01:58:02.320 --> 01:58:12.320
So as I did, I said it, it looked decent. I got a big key. Oh, I did it! We're here! Right, we're

01:58:12.320 --> 01:58:18.160
going to go back and fill up our health. I just realized we did it. I was too busy rambling away

01:58:18.880 --> 01:58:21.280
that we're actually at the boss. Right, we need to try hard.

01:58:23.280 --> 01:58:27.680
The first Overwatch 2 trailer happened. Literally, we all should have seen it come in when Papa Jeff

01:58:27.680 --> 01:58:34.720
left because Overwatch was his baby. Okay, whoa, I'm like a pixel off of getting Mars burnt.

01:58:35.040 --> 01:58:46.240
Whoa, ready? Ready for a boss fight? I guess these are just hearts, yeah. Oh wow, okay.

01:58:47.600 --> 01:58:50.000
I can't remember what happens in here.

01:58:54.480 --> 01:58:54.960
Oh no.

01:58:58.000 --> 01:58:58.480
Whoa!

01:59:01.360 --> 01:59:03.680
Honestly, it looks like a really cool level of Pokemon.

01:59:05.680 --> 01:59:08.880
Oh, you can throw fire at me? That's not very nice.

01:59:10.480 --> 01:59:15.680
Take this! Okay, I missed. I think I'm supposed to flip his arse. No, no, clearly not.

01:59:16.880 --> 01:59:20.000
I did! You are supposed to flip his arse. Okay, okay, okay.

01:59:22.560 --> 01:59:29.760
Tapping his horn! Okay, that's the best I can do. Ow, I just freaking hurt myself.

01:59:30.640 --> 01:59:35.520
Uh, I don't have a lava spell to save me. Hello?

01:59:38.800 --> 01:59:42.800
Bruh, you better calm down with that lava spread. I don't know what you want from me.

01:59:44.880 --> 01:59:47.920
Okay, boom! Get ready. No, okay, he's not vulnerable.

01:59:47.920 --> 01:59:50.000
Have he's vulnerable? Vulnerable? No, not yet.

01:59:50.560 --> 01:59:52.240
Vulnerable? Yes!

01:59:55.760 --> 01:59:56.560
With all your might!

01:59:59.840 --> 02:00:02.480
Yes! Okay, we did it, we did it, we did it, we did it.

02:00:04.800 --> 02:00:08.480
This is all fire. Wait, oh, ow, my freaking head.

02:00:08.480 --> 02:00:12.400
Okay, I'll take that. Yeah, this is all fire, which is not good for us,

02:00:12.400 --> 02:00:16.480
because we need to be able to have mobility around the map, or we're in trouble.

02:00:20.480 --> 02:00:23.600
Okay, okay, vulnerable. Okay, through your fire, that's fine.

02:00:23.600 --> 02:00:30.720
We are too early, we are too early, we are too not in the right direction.

02:00:31.680 --> 02:00:37.280
Nope, he's already adjusted. Stop adjusting! Bruh, that's a bit...

02:00:37.280 --> 02:00:40.320
Bruh, I literally have no nubut, no nubut. Take that.

02:00:42.400 --> 02:00:43.440
Okay, okay, one...

02:00:46.240 --> 02:00:51.280
Okay, wow. I like it to teleport me on the fire, like rain between it.

02:00:52.240 --> 02:00:53.520
Appreciate that, please don't do it again.

02:00:55.840 --> 02:00:56.800
Oh, we did it!

02:01:00.000 --> 02:01:02.480
Hello? Oh, I thought my game paused there, I was like,

02:01:03.360 --> 02:01:05.920
I think we have an encounter technical difficulties.

02:01:08.560 --> 02:01:11.040
We did it! What's the element? The fire?

02:01:11.840 --> 02:01:17.520
Heat element? It must be heat. It must be, surely it's heat element.

02:01:17.520 --> 02:01:22.880
You got the fire element. Flames bring light to darkness and warmth to all.

02:01:22.880 --> 02:01:28.880
The fire element is the embodiment of that power. Fire girl confirmed for Jintu?

02:01:31.360 --> 02:01:36.800
You got a heart container, absolutely gorgeous. I love me a heart container.

02:01:38.320 --> 02:01:40.720
So you must get a heart container every boss you dealt with.

02:01:41.680 --> 02:01:46.400
Oh, that was so hot, and I, it was... Oh, that was hot. It was so hot,

02:01:46.400 --> 02:01:49.520
I thought my fibers would catch fire. Ah, but it's over now.

02:01:49.520 --> 02:01:51.920
I suppose we should get back and speak to Malari.

02:01:53.840 --> 02:01:56.240
Like Malari, or should I say we Malari?

02:02:02.000 --> 02:02:04.880
Hello? Hello? Americano?

02:02:05.040 --> 02:02:12.720
Wow, that was fast work, but not so fast that I didn't finish your sword.

02:02:12.720 --> 02:02:16.320
Here, take a look. I call this new blade the white sword.

02:02:16.320 --> 02:02:18.960
Well, it's green clearly by the handle, but whatever.

02:02:20.320 --> 02:02:24.320
You got the white sword. It's, you got the white sword.

02:02:24.320 --> 02:02:26.800
It's beautiful white blade sparkles with light.

02:02:26.800 --> 02:02:29.120
You can put away your grandfather's sword now.

02:02:29.120 --> 02:02:32.560
Oh, once you infuse it with the power of the elements,

02:02:32.560 --> 02:02:38.080
it will become a sacred blade. The forest elder no doubt told you this part,

02:02:38.080 --> 02:02:43.040
but if you want to infuse the sword, you must go to the elemental sanctuary.

02:02:43.680 --> 02:02:47.680
The sanctuary is a strange realm, sorry I keep forgetting the voices,

02:02:47.680 --> 02:02:53.200
trapped between two worlds. It is the bridge between the Minish world and the human world.

02:02:54.800 --> 02:02:59.440
The doorway to the sanctuary opens only once every hundred years.

02:02:59.440 --> 02:03:01.840
You'll find that door hidden within the castle.

02:03:02.400 --> 02:03:06.080
Once that blade has been filled with the power of the four elements,

02:03:06.720 --> 02:03:10.400
you should be able to break the curse of the princess,

02:03:10.400 --> 02:03:14.640
and I know that you can do it. After all, you made short work of that human mind.

02:03:15.200 --> 02:03:19.280
Let me tell you about a shortcut that you can get down through the mountain.

02:03:19.840 --> 02:03:24.640
You'll find it right in front of the entrance of the mine you just explored.

02:03:25.280 --> 02:03:28.960
You'll follow, just follow that and you'll be down in no time in the park.

02:03:29.760 --> 02:03:33.760
Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you very much.

02:03:36.080 --> 02:03:38.480
Thanks for making the sword, I appreciate it.

02:03:42.560 --> 02:03:44.080
I appreciate it, love good sword moment.

02:03:45.760 --> 02:03:48.560
Short cut through the mountain, that's in through the mountain.

02:03:49.600 --> 02:03:52.800
Secret, secret, secret, secret, short cut.

02:03:54.000 --> 02:03:56.080
Short cut to the bottom, a little to the right, okay.

02:03:59.200 --> 02:04:01.440
To reflink, well no.

02:04:03.920 --> 02:04:06.400
Short cut to the bottom, no, it's not to reflink.

02:04:08.240 --> 02:04:14.800
To, ah, to lovers, forbidden from one another.

02:04:14.800 --> 02:04:23.120
I mentioned divides their people, and the day didn't end.

02:04:23.120 --> 02:04:24.560
Oh wait, I've said that wrong.

02:04:24.560 --> 02:04:27.200
Wait, post the lyrics, post the lyrics so I can say it right.

02:04:28.160 --> 02:04:29.920
I've messed it up, I've messed it up.

02:04:31.040 --> 02:04:34.000
To reflink, well am I technically a reflink?

02:04:34.960 --> 02:04:35.840
Yeah, I think so.

02:04:37.840 --> 02:04:40.000
I love the environmental kills, they're quite sad.

02:04:41.600 --> 02:04:43.680
Right, we need to go to the castello.

02:04:44.400 --> 02:04:47.840
Hydration check, no, because then I have to make a cup of tea and I'll be awake.

02:04:49.120 --> 02:04:51.280
Straining herself is the shortcut to the bottom.

02:04:51.280 --> 02:05:00.080
Um, we got loads of stones, do you guys want to trade?

02:05:01.440 --> 02:05:02.320
Wait, none of them?

02:05:04.800 --> 02:05:07.280
No one wants to do kingstone pieces?

02:05:07.280 --> 02:05:08.560
You want a fuse, yes please.

02:05:09.520 --> 02:05:11.280
Wow, I've got it, I've got it, I've got it.

02:05:11.280 --> 02:05:12.720
The two fit perfectly.

02:05:13.440 --> 02:05:19.040
Two lovers, forbidden from one another.

02:05:19.040 --> 02:05:30.480
A war divides their people, and a mountain divides them apart.

02:05:30.480 --> 02:05:38.480
Built a path to be together, and yeah, I can never forget the next couple of lines,

02:05:38.480 --> 02:05:52.480
and then it goes secret tunnel, secret tunnel through the mountain, secret, secret, secret tunnel.

02:05:55.680 --> 02:05:58.640
And then everyone clapped as a mule.

02:06:00.320 --> 02:06:01.840
I'd like to go down the stream.

02:06:03.520 --> 02:06:04.960
Wah, chest?

02:06:04.960 --> 02:06:06.480
Chest, yes chest.

02:06:07.200 --> 02:06:09.680
So green is like money rewards, I guess?

02:06:12.880 --> 02:06:14.480
Oh my god, who are you?

02:06:17.200 --> 02:06:18.960
How can they make pixels so sexy?

02:06:19.840 --> 02:06:23.600
We hear all sorts of interesting gossip in here.

02:06:23.600 --> 02:06:25.840
Stop by from time to time.

02:06:25.840 --> 02:06:29.280
Hello lady, I want a fuse canstone.

02:06:29.280 --> 02:06:32.720
Whoa, how am I miraculously having the pieces that they want?

02:06:37.040 --> 02:06:41.120
That looks like the cow farm, because of that little pitch on the side.

02:06:42.320 --> 02:06:43.120
And everyone too.

02:06:44.800 --> 02:06:49.040
She's got a mule too sharp, did they pixelate a mule on her?

02:06:49.040 --> 02:06:53.840
No way, they freaking pixelated the milk mule, that's hilarious.

02:06:53.840 --> 02:06:55.200
Right, what happens if I go tiny?

02:06:56.000 --> 02:06:58.640
Please shrink me down, please shrink me down.

02:07:01.040 --> 02:07:04.000
I have been educated, I've now learned where secret tunnel comes from.

02:07:04.000 --> 02:07:06.560
Yes, it comes from Avatar The Last Airbender.

02:07:06.560 --> 02:07:08.480
Did Emmy get to that episode?

02:07:08.480 --> 02:07:09.120
I'm not sure.

02:07:10.000 --> 02:07:10.880
She might have.

02:07:10.880 --> 02:07:13.360
That's right, even human objects are porous in the Minish world.

02:07:13.360 --> 02:07:15.920
These Minish may not look like much, but they are quite crafty.

02:07:17.040 --> 02:07:19.600
Unfortunately, I think I need something to push that.

02:07:20.480 --> 02:07:22.160
Oh hello, hi.

02:07:23.200 --> 02:07:26.720
This cafe is so busy, you can hear all sorts of stuff from the people here.

02:07:26.720 --> 02:07:30.080
Oh my god, their bed is a freaking take off!

02:07:30.080 --> 02:07:32.640
Ah, I can't handle how cute this game is.

02:07:32.720 --> 02:07:36.000
It's hard not to get stepped on when there are so many people here.

02:07:36.000 --> 02:07:37.920
Their posters are stamps!

02:07:39.600 --> 02:07:41.520
So cute, and look at their little light.

02:07:41.520 --> 02:07:42.800
It's a wee globey thing.

02:07:42.800 --> 02:07:44.160
And they got like a little baby!

02:07:44.160 --> 02:07:45.920
Oh my god, they have baby pottery.

02:07:45.920 --> 02:07:47.680
Look at the tiny plates and everything.

02:07:47.680 --> 02:07:49.680
Oh my god, the floor is a menu!

02:07:51.040 --> 02:07:54.720
Oh come on, you cannot tell me this game wasn't a passion,

02:07:54.720 --> 02:07:57.280
a project of love from the development team.

02:07:57.280 --> 02:07:58.080
It's so cute.

02:08:00.160 --> 02:08:01.280
It's so kawaii.

02:08:02.080 --> 02:08:03.440
How am I supposed to...

02:08:03.440 --> 02:08:04.880
How am I supposed to do this?

02:08:05.680 --> 02:08:06.400
It's so cute.

02:08:06.400 --> 02:08:08.640
Wait, hold on a minute.

02:08:08.640 --> 02:08:10.160
Are you squidding me right now?

02:08:11.680 --> 02:08:14.560
Look at your avatar then asked the question again.

02:08:15.120 --> 02:08:16.320
If you can look sexy...

02:08:16.320 --> 02:08:17.920
It's the pixel girl can do.

02:08:18.560 --> 02:08:19.200
Thank you.

02:08:19.920 --> 02:08:21.440
You like my watermelon hair?

02:08:21.440 --> 02:08:21.920
Thank you.

02:08:22.640 --> 02:08:24.240
Thank you very much for the tip.

02:08:24.240 --> 02:08:25.600
All right, the super chat.

02:08:25.600 --> 02:08:28.000
Sorry, I'm not supposed to get them confused.

02:08:28.000 --> 02:08:30.240
Wait, I want to talk to the chickadee!

02:08:30.240 --> 02:08:30.720
Hello!

02:08:31.840 --> 02:08:33.360
Hi, little baby.

02:08:33.360 --> 02:08:33.760
Hello!

02:08:34.960 --> 02:08:35.440
Eep!

02:08:35.440 --> 02:08:36.320
One of the menace.

02:08:36.320 --> 02:08:36.880
Peep!

02:08:36.880 --> 02:08:38.160
I'm not like my brothers.

02:08:38.160 --> 02:08:40.000
I won't chase you around and pick you.

02:08:40.000 --> 02:08:42.080
Not only that, I have some good info for you.

02:08:42.080 --> 02:08:43.840
Somewhere in Hyrule, there's a great fairy

02:08:43.840 --> 02:08:45.600
who helps honest adventures.

02:08:45.600 --> 02:08:49.280
If you hear her, answer her every question truthfully.

02:08:49.280 --> 02:08:52.320
You want to chit chit use kensun?

02:08:52.320 --> 02:08:53.520
Oh, I'm so sorry!

02:08:53.520 --> 02:08:57.040
Oh my god, look at this fucking wee icon!

02:08:57.040 --> 02:08:59.440
That's the cutest thing ever!

02:09:01.280 --> 02:09:02.560
Oh my god!

02:09:02.560 --> 02:09:03.280
I'm so sorry!

02:09:03.280 --> 02:09:04.640
I'll come back with kensun soon.

02:09:04.640 --> 02:09:05.920
I'm so sorry!

02:09:05.920 --> 02:09:06.880
Go menace, sorry!

02:09:08.640 --> 02:09:09.600
All right, what's over here?

02:09:10.160 --> 02:09:11.360
I don't know.

02:09:11.360 --> 02:09:12.080
There's a bush.

02:09:15.360 --> 02:09:17.760
We can go inside this building.

02:09:19.440 --> 02:09:19.760
Oh!

02:09:21.840 --> 02:09:22.560
What is this?

02:09:24.800 --> 02:09:26.080
There's construction men.

02:09:26.080 --> 02:09:26.480
Hello!

02:09:27.760 --> 02:09:28.880
The boss makes him rough,

02:09:28.880 --> 02:09:30.480
but he's a real softy at heart.

02:09:30.480 --> 02:09:31.040
Aww.

02:09:39.840 --> 02:09:41.920
Now this kid is trying to eat stuff, though.

02:09:41.920 --> 02:09:42.640
Hello!

02:09:42.640 --> 02:09:43.600
Oh, you want to trade?

02:09:43.600 --> 02:09:44.720
Yeah, let's view it.

02:09:44.720 --> 02:09:46.080
Oh, I don't have any green.

02:09:46.640 --> 02:09:47.600
Sorry.

02:09:47.600 --> 02:09:48.240
Listen up.

02:09:48.240 --> 02:09:49.200
I'm a skilled carpenter

02:09:49.200 --> 02:09:50.400
and I'm looking for a challenge.

02:09:51.280 --> 02:09:52.080
Uh, okay.

02:09:52.080 --> 02:09:52.400
Hi!

02:09:53.280 --> 02:09:57.520
I'm really quite good at tracking down rare figurines.

02:09:58.240 --> 02:09:58.560
Okay.

02:09:58.800 --> 02:09:59.280
Hi!

02:09:59.920 --> 02:10:01.360
Hello, puppy!

02:10:01.360 --> 02:10:01.680
Hello!

02:10:05.040 --> 02:10:05.920
What is all this?

02:10:05.920 --> 02:10:06.320
I'm busy.

02:10:06.320 --> 02:10:06.720
Don't you see?

02:10:06.720 --> 02:10:08.080
Do not disturb my research.

02:10:08.080 --> 02:10:09.520
If you have no business, be gone!

02:10:10.640 --> 02:10:11.600
Sorry, please.

02:10:13.360 --> 02:10:15.680
Can I get any green kensun from here?

02:10:16.800 --> 02:10:18.160
One green kensun.

02:10:18.800 --> 02:10:19.520
One.

02:10:19.520 --> 02:10:20.000
Fine.

02:10:20.000 --> 02:10:20.640
I'll get a rupee.

02:10:20.640 --> 02:10:21.120
I'll take it.

02:10:23.520 --> 02:10:23.840
Hello!

02:10:24.640 --> 02:10:25.040
Speak!

02:10:26.320 --> 02:10:28.080
I collected those mysterious shells.

02:10:28.560 --> 02:10:30.080
Ah!

02:10:30.080 --> 02:10:31.520
I collect those mysterious shells

02:10:31.520 --> 02:10:33.280
you've been scattered all over the place.

02:10:33.280 --> 02:10:34.240
If you bring these shells,

02:10:34.240 --> 02:10:36.080
I'll trade you these figurines I've made.

02:10:36.080 --> 02:10:37.920
Ah, what is that mysterious shell?

02:10:37.920 --> 02:10:39.520
Hmm, I've got an offer I'd like to make you.

02:10:40.160 --> 02:10:41.840
What do you say for trading it

02:10:41.840 --> 02:10:43.360
for a chance of winning a figurine?

02:10:43.360 --> 02:10:43.600
Sure.

02:10:44.640 --> 02:10:46.640
How many shells would you like to use?

02:10:46.640 --> 02:10:47.600
The more shells you use,

02:10:47.600 --> 02:10:48.880
the more likely to have a figurine.

02:10:50.640 --> 02:10:51.920
Probability, 100%.

02:10:51.920 --> 02:10:52.960
Well, I'll just use one.

02:10:52.960 --> 02:10:54.320
You're going to trade one of them?

02:10:54.320 --> 02:10:54.720
Great.

02:10:54.720 --> 02:10:57.760
Now just pull the lever on the figure dispensing machine.

02:10:58.560 --> 02:10:59.600
I will pull the lever.

02:11:01.360 --> 02:11:02.400
Ego de...

02:11:02.400 --> 02:11:03.200
Oh no!

02:11:03.200 --> 02:11:03.760
Gacha!

02:11:04.880 --> 02:11:06.160
This is gacha pawn.

02:11:06.960 --> 02:11:07.920
Pesto.

02:11:07.920 --> 02:11:09.760
Appears in Minish Road's dungeons.

02:11:09.760 --> 02:11:11.280
They are red and blue ones.

02:11:12.400 --> 02:11:13.680
The blue ones are stronger

02:11:13.680 --> 02:11:15.120
and throw things down on your head.

02:11:16.560 --> 02:11:17.600
Congratulations!

02:11:17.600 --> 02:11:19.280
I'll keep the figures in this case

02:11:19.280 --> 02:11:20.240
on the left for you.

02:11:20.240 --> 02:11:21.600
You can see them anytime.

02:11:21.600 --> 02:11:22.400
Oh, that's so cute!

02:11:22.400 --> 02:11:23.360
We'll come back and do that.

02:11:23.360 --> 02:11:25.440
I think that's going to be quite time consuming,

02:11:25.440 --> 02:11:26.000
to be honest.

02:11:27.200 --> 02:11:28.400
Can I have a figurine?

02:11:28.800 --> 02:11:31.120
Or is the answer no?

02:11:31.120 --> 02:11:32.080
Hey, I can still.

02:11:32.080 --> 02:11:32.640
Pardon me.

02:11:34.240 --> 02:11:36.000
I don't think I'm allowed it.

02:11:36.000 --> 02:11:36.320
Okay.

02:11:37.040 --> 02:11:38.000
Let's jump on this.

02:11:39.520 --> 02:11:41.840
This is mainly a same quest for 100%.

02:11:41.840 --> 02:11:42.480
Okay, okay.

02:11:44.480 --> 02:11:45.600
Uh, I might...

02:11:45.600 --> 02:11:46.160
Oh, hello!

02:11:47.120 --> 02:11:47.680
Oh, sorry.

02:11:47.680 --> 02:11:48.160
Am I in the way?

02:11:48.160 --> 02:11:48.800
I just wanted to...

02:11:48.800 --> 02:11:50.160
Anyway, it's nice of you to say hi.

02:11:50.160 --> 02:11:50.960
Sorry for the trouble.

02:11:50.960 --> 02:11:51.520
Move now.

02:11:51.520 --> 02:11:51.840
Aw.

02:11:52.560 --> 02:11:53.200
Yeah, I want to...

02:11:53.200 --> 02:11:54.480
Aw, don't have green!

02:11:55.360 --> 02:11:56.080
I'm sorry.

02:11:56.080 --> 02:11:57.120
I don't have green.

02:11:58.080 --> 02:11:58.720
Wow!

02:11:58.720 --> 02:11:59.680
What's going on here?

02:12:00.400 --> 02:12:01.360
Well, we can't go up,

02:12:01.360 --> 02:12:02.320
so we can go...

02:12:02.320 --> 02:12:02.720
Hello!

02:12:03.520 --> 02:12:06.160
Hey, do you know the clothes that reveal the location of treasure?

02:12:06.160 --> 02:12:08.640
Cross the bridge that spans the rapid flow

02:12:08.640 --> 02:12:10.320
through the land of the fearsome beast

02:12:10.320 --> 02:12:11.520
until you reach the misty falls

02:12:11.520 --> 02:12:13.360
where treasure sleeps on the other side of this bridge?

02:12:15.600 --> 02:12:17.040
Um, okay.

02:12:18.960 --> 02:12:19.360
Okay.

02:12:22.640 --> 02:12:23.360
Wait a minute.

02:12:24.320 --> 02:12:25.200
Wait a minute.

02:12:25.840 --> 02:12:28.160
I am getting a memory.

02:12:31.760 --> 02:12:33.200
Oh, I can't use the stairs!

02:12:34.800 --> 02:12:35.280
Sugar.

02:12:37.280 --> 02:12:37.600
There's...

02:12:37.600 --> 02:12:39.600
So, there is a push ring item.

02:12:40.640 --> 02:12:40.880
Um...

02:12:42.720 --> 02:12:43.040
Wow.

02:12:44.400 --> 02:12:45.920
Okay, so the dog moves now,

02:12:45.920 --> 02:12:48.080
so we can, like, get access to this area,

02:12:48.080 --> 02:12:48.800
which is good.

02:12:48.800 --> 02:12:49.520
Hi, Popper!

02:12:49.520 --> 02:12:50.080
You okay?

02:12:50.080 --> 02:12:52.240
Oh, he's happy now, which is good.

02:12:52.240 --> 02:12:56.640
Wait, so why can't I get into this guy's house?

02:12:59.520 --> 02:13:00.240
What is all this?

02:13:00.240 --> 02:13:00.880
I'm busy.

02:13:00.880 --> 02:13:01.920
Do not disturb my research.

02:13:01.920 --> 02:13:03.200
If you have no business, be gone.

02:13:06.880 --> 02:13:07.760
Excuse me, doggy.

02:13:07.760 --> 02:13:09.040
You're still in the way.

02:13:09.040 --> 02:13:10.000
Excuse me, doggy.

02:13:10.000 --> 02:13:10.720
You're still in...

02:13:10.720 --> 02:13:11.840
Excuse me, doggy.

02:13:11.840 --> 02:13:12.640
Thank you.

02:13:13.760 --> 02:13:14.160
Hello?

02:13:15.200 --> 02:13:15.760
Dev team?

02:13:16.560 --> 02:13:17.360
Okay, there.

02:13:17.360 --> 02:13:18.000
There, jeez.

02:13:18.720 --> 02:13:21.680
I think we have to do a library quest,

02:13:21.680 --> 02:13:22.480
or not yet.

02:13:24.880 --> 02:13:26.560
But, sure, I'll use Ken's stuff.

02:13:26.560 --> 02:13:27.040
Red!

02:13:27.680 --> 02:13:29.440
I won't even have a red one.

02:13:30.800 --> 02:13:31.920
I'll get the ring later.

02:13:31.920 --> 02:13:33.120
Okay, that's fine.

02:13:33.120 --> 02:13:34.000
Right, Reeflings.

02:13:34.000 --> 02:13:35.200
Time to feed you.

02:13:35.200 --> 02:13:36.320
Who's hungry?

02:13:36.320 --> 02:13:37.200
Let's get the cake.

02:13:38.400 --> 02:13:39.120
Hello.

02:13:39.120 --> 02:13:39.760
Welcome.

02:13:39.760 --> 02:13:40.240
You've come.

02:13:40.880 --> 02:13:42.800
I have a pretty tasty slice.

02:13:43.360 --> 02:13:44.560
60 rupees!

02:13:44.560 --> 02:13:45.760
That's a bit of a rip off, hey,

02:13:45.760 --> 02:13:46.800
and I'm gonna be honest.

02:13:47.600 --> 02:13:49.360
All right, we did get a Ken's stone piece, though,

02:13:49.360 --> 02:13:50.880
and we did get a Ken's stone piece.

02:13:50.960 --> 02:13:52.640
Is that how you farm Ken's stone pieces?

02:13:53.680 --> 02:13:54.400
Hello?

02:13:54.400 --> 02:13:54.800
Howdy.

02:13:54.800 --> 02:13:55.920
Come get your fresh veggies.

02:13:55.920 --> 02:13:57.040
They're fresher than fresh.

02:13:58.080 --> 02:13:59.040
Straight out of the ground.

02:13:59.040 --> 02:14:00.160
Uh, what are you?

02:14:01.680 --> 02:14:02.720
Ah, that's unfortunate.

02:14:02.720 --> 02:14:03.280
They're not opening it.

02:14:03.280 --> 02:14:04.000
We'll come back later.

02:14:04.000 --> 02:14:04.800
Okay, that's fine.

02:14:04.800 --> 02:14:06.080
Oh, excuse me, Mr. Postman.

02:14:06.080 --> 02:14:06.880
You're in my way.

02:14:06.880 --> 02:14:08.160
Oh, now you're both in my way.

02:14:08.160 --> 02:14:09.280
Oh, okay, everyone's in my way.

02:14:09.280 --> 02:14:09.760
That's fine.

02:14:10.880 --> 02:14:11.600
The door's shut.

02:14:11.600 --> 02:14:12.880
We can't open it from this side.

02:14:12.880 --> 02:14:13.360
How bizarre.

02:14:17.440 --> 02:14:18.880
Finally, a sandwich.

02:14:18.880 --> 02:14:19.280
Yeah.

02:14:20.240 --> 02:14:22.400
Well, we go get some food and...

02:14:26.240 --> 02:14:26.640
Open.

02:14:28.720 --> 02:14:29.840
Open sesame.

02:14:29.840 --> 02:14:33.120
Right, we can't seem to do the ring yet.

02:14:33.680 --> 02:14:34.800
This is the ring.

02:14:34.800 --> 02:14:36.720
Oh, there's a child in one of you.

02:14:37.280 --> 02:14:39.040
I don't have your pace.

02:14:39.040 --> 02:14:41.360
Stop asking for pieces that I don't have.

02:14:42.480 --> 02:14:43.520
Don't be so selfish.

02:14:43.520 --> 02:14:43.920
Hello?

02:14:44.800 --> 02:14:45.760
I really wanna play a game,

02:14:45.760 --> 02:14:46.880
but this place isn't open yet.

02:14:46.880 --> 02:14:48.080
Guess I got here too early.

02:14:48.080 --> 02:14:48.880
Okay, that's fine.

02:14:48.880 --> 02:14:49.600
What's this?

02:14:52.240 --> 02:14:55.040
Oh, wait, I can make my shield bigger?

02:14:55.840 --> 02:14:56.880
What's for you?

02:14:56.880 --> 02:14:57.440
What are you?

02:14:57.440 --> 02:14:57.920
Hello?

02:14:57.920 --> 02:14:58.480
What is this?

02:14:59.200 --> 02:15:01.520
For only 80 rupees for a wallet.

02:15:01.520 --> 02:15:02.560
Oh, I don't have enough.

02:15:03.360 --> 02:15:05.680
Oh, we maybe could have had enough

02:15:05.680 --> 02:15:07.360
if I didn't spend it on the cake.

02:15:07.360 --> 02:15:08.160
But you know what?

02:15:08.160 --> 02:15:09.520
I'm happy I got to treat you.

02:15:10.160 --> 02:15:11.440
And we already got five back.

02:15:11.440 --> 02:15:12.480
It was like an investment.

02:15:13.120 --> 02:15:13.840
Go in here.

02:15:13.840 --> 02:15:14.720
Go in the well.

02:15:15.280 --> 02:15:16.080
Go in the well.

02:15:16.080 --> 02:15:16.640
In the well.

02:15:16.640 --> 02:15:17.280
In the well.

02:15:18.400 --> 02:15:18.880
Exactly.

02:15:21.280 --> 02:15:23.040
Oh, why is it giving demon noises?

02:15:23.840 --> 02:15:25.840
Oh, I can't swim yet.

02:15:25.840 --> 02:15:26.640
I'm not good enough.

02:15:27.440 --> 02:15:29.520
The snakes can also steal your shield.

02:15:30.160 --> 02:15:31.280
So you have to get it back.

02:15:35.680 --> 02:15:36.480
That's unfortunate.

02:15:36.480 --> 02:15:37.440
They're not open yet.

02:15:37.440 --> 02:15:38.480
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

02:15:38.480 --> 02:15:40.480
I'm getting the picture that nothing's open

02:15:40.480 --> 02:15:42.160
because I'm trying to do stuff a bit too early

02:15:42.160 --> 02:15:43.920
in the sections.

02:15:43.920 --> 02:15:45.360
Right, let's go to the castle.

02:15:45.360 --> 02:15:47.600
We will infuse our lovely sword.

02:15:49.680 --> 02:15:52.160
And then we will have a quick break

02:15:52.160 --> 02:15:53.440
and I will make a cup of tea.

02:15:54.160 --> 02:15:57.280
So my voice doesn't shatter into a thousand different pieces.

02:15:57.280 --> 02:15:58.320
Is there something to the right?

02:15:59.280 --> 02:16:00.320
Oh, I've not unlocked it.

02:16:00.320 --> 02:16:01.600
Whoa, gammy.

02:16:02.720 --> 02:16:04.160
Gammy's aggro.

02:16:04.160 --> 02:16:05.440
Gammy, that's not it.

02:16:05.440 --> 02:16:07.360
Don't be aggro, gammy.

02:16:07.360 --> 02:16:08.080
It's bad.

02:16:08.720 --> 02:16:09.520
It's bombless.

02:16:09.840 --> 02:16:15.520
What's over here?

02:16:16.720 --> 02:16:17.840
I can't swim.

02:16:17.840 --> 02:16:20.560
Whoa, he's got a bomb in his hand.

02:16:20.560 --> 02:16:22.480
Whoa, look at the size of that waterfall.

02:16:22.480 --> 02:16:24.560
Beautiful, simply beautiful, my boy.

02:16:24.560 --> 02:16:26.000
I'm glad he appreciates.

02:16:26.000 --> 02:16:27.040
All right, we can't swim.

02:16:27.040 --> 02:16:28.960
So there's absolutely nothing we can do in this area.

02:16:32.400 --> 02:16:33.760
Don't forget the golden snakes.

02:16:33.760 --> 02:16:34.560
So they got money.

02:16:34.960 --> 02:16:40.080
Oh, it's like a little minch thing here.

02:16:41.200 --> 02:16:45.520
Oh, I'm glad I picked that up for whatever future use I mean to have for it.

02:16:46.800 --> 02:16:49.760
I know, gammy's feeling a bit possessed right now and it's fine.

02:16:49.760 --> 02:16:50.720
What's this?

02:16:50.720 --> 02:16:51.600
Royal Valley.

02:16:52.720 --> 02:16:55.120
Well, bombless since we've got full bomb anyway,

02:16:55.120 --> 02:16:58.480
so it's probably going to be a waste of a bomb.

02:17:01.040 --> 02:17:02.560
What the heck is this place?

02:17:03.520 --> 02:17:06.000
Whoa, I'll take it.

02:17:06.000 --> 02:17:07.200
A piece of part.

02:17:07.200 --> 02:17:08.720
Oh, we've got a new heart container.

02:17:08.720 --> 02:17:09.680
That's fantastic.

02:17:12.800 --> 02:17:13.680
Okay, we can't swim.

02:17:13.680 --> 02:17:14.320
We can't swim.

02:17:14.320 --> 02:17:14.960
So it's fine.

02:17:16.000 --> 02:17:17.200
Fantastico.

02:17:17.200 --> 02:17:18.720
We have a new heart container.

02:17:19.280 --> 02:17:20.560
We love tea in this house.

02:17:24.800 --> 02:17:25.360
Just got here.

02:17:25.360 --> 02:17:26.560
What's happened so far?

02:17:26.560 --> 02:17:28.560
We have got the earth element.

02:17:28.560 --> 02:17:30.240
We've just picked up the fire element

02:17:30.320 --> 02:17:32.720
and we're about to infuse the sword.

02:17:34.400 --> 02:17:36.080
Are you sure I look all right?

02:17:36.080 --> 02:17:38.480
I never know what to wear for formal occasions.

02:17:38.480 --> 02:17:39.440
My guy, you're a hat.

02:17:41.360 --> 02:17:46.800
We basically just need to go under the castle to find the secret room.

02:17:49.440 --> 02:17:53.280
And then we can learn a new technique from the sword master.

02:17:54.800 --> 02:17:56.080
But yeah, very beautiful.

02:17:56.960 --> 02:17:59.200
Link, look, see that doorway goes?

02:17:59.840 --> 02:18:02.240
Could that be the door that leads to the sanctuary?

02:18:02.240 --> 02:18:04.240
Nobody in this castle seems to be able to see it,

02:18:04.240 --> 02:18:05.200
but you and me.

02:18:05.200 --> 02:18:06.080
Let's go quickly.

02:18:07.440 --> 02:18:09.440
It's elemental sanctuary.

02:18:10.480 --> 02:18:11.920
Wow, the music, the music.

02:18:12.720 --> 02:18:13.760
The music, please.

02:18:18.560 --> 02:18:18.960
Wow.

02:18:24.800 --> 02:18:26.000
Okay, there it is.

02:18:26.800 --> 02:18:27.920
Hmm.

02:18:27.920 --> 02:18:30.320
So this is the elemental sanctuary then.

02:18:30.320 --> 02:18:33.360
This is where we can infuse your blade with the power of the elements.

02:18:33.360 --> 02:18:36.400
Yes, that seems to be the pedestal for it.

02:18:36.400 --> 02:18:37.520
Let's shove it in.

02:18:39.040 --> 02:18:39.280
Bump.

02:18:41.760 --> 02:18:42.880
There we go.

02:18:42.880 --> 02:18:44.240
Two element and some fears.

02:18:45.600 --> 02:18:46.640
We're doing it.

02:18:50.640 --> 02:18:51.520
It's perfect.

02:18:52.480 --> 02:18:56.880
It glows.

02:19:00.400 --> 02:19:05.120
The powers of earthen fire elements have infused your blade.

02:19:12.240 --> 02:19:15.600
Let's see if I can read that tablet for you.

02:19:15.600 --> 02:19:18.960
Fill your sword with the power and walk over the glowing tail.

02:19:19.520 --> 02:19:22.880
Perhaps it refers to those flashing spots on the floor around you.

02:19:22.880 --> 02:19:24.320
Well, what are you waiting for?

02:19:24.320 --> 02:19:25.040
Try it, Link.

02:19:27.920 --> 02:19:28.880
Oh, not yet.

02:19:30.880 --> 02:19:31.600
There's two of us.

02:19:33.760 --> 02:19:35.200
You just split in two.

02:19:35.200 --> 02:19:37.200
So this is the power of the white sword?

02:19:37.760 --> 02:19:39.520
I guess you can double yourself like that

02:19:39.520 --> 02:19:41.040
anytime when you see those panels.

02:19:43.440 --> 02:19:47.200
Okay, now we have a few more abilities, which is good.

02:19:49.360 --> 02:19:54.720
Um, there was a few things back the way that we did overlook.

02:19:54.720 --> 02:19:56.480
We're going to go back and hit the town

02:19:56.480 --> 02:20:00.080
because I want to learn what the master possession will teach us.

02:20:01.600 --> 02:20:04.240
Um, right, we'll run back into town

02:20:04.240 --> 02:20:06.640
and then we'll run and get snacks and go for a pee.

02:20:07.440 --> 02:20:07.840
Okay.

02:20:09.440 --> 02:20:10.240
What dungeon?

02:20:10.240 --> 02:20:11.600
This is the Castello.

02:20:12.240 --> 02:20:14.240
We're getting the elements infused

02:20:14.240 --> 02:20:16.000
and we're about to go for the third element.

02:20:16.080 --> 02:20:19.280
Oh, wait, there's a snake to the right, isn't there?

02:20:20.320 --> 02:20:22.560
Oh, I can't get access to it because of the guards.

02:20:23.200 --> 02:20:23.680
I don't know.

02:20:24.560 --> 02:20:25.440
I tried.

02:20:25.440 --> 02:20:26.480
Um, oh!

02:20:29.680 --> 02:20:30.480
Oh, they're English.

02:20:30.480 --> 02:20:31.680
Wait, what's an English voice?

02:20:32.400 --> 02:20:33.280
Interesting.

02:20:33.280 --> 02:20:36.080
You're the last person I expected to find here

02:20:36.080 --> 02:20:38.960
and just as I was wondering who could be behind this,

02:20:38.960 --> 02:20:41.200
I find my old master.

02:20:46.640 --> 02:20:47.140
Wow.

02:20:49.040 --> 02:20:49.540
Vati!

02:20:51.120 --> 02:20:55.920
Oh, and as always, you are dressed in the shabbiest of rags.

02:20:56.560 --> 02:20:58.720
My curses are not to be mocked.

02:20:58.720 --> 02:21:01.440
The one I cast on you is the most powerful.

02:21:01.440 --> 02:21:05.600
No matter what power you wield, you will never break it.

02:21:09.040 --> 02:21:11.520
You have me changed in the slightest, yabam.

02:21:12.080 --> 02:21:14.240
I should never have created that cap.

02:21:14.240 --> 02:21:16.480
It only fueled your insane desires.

02:21:17.280 --> 02:21:19.760
Thank you for becoming a member, Sortar.

02:21:19.760 --> 02:21:21.040
Sortar B'lain.

02:21:23.200 --> 02:21:23.680
Fool.

02:21:24.480 --> 02:21:27.360
A hat that grants the wishes of its wearer

02:21:27.360 --> 02:21:29.600
as a spectacular creation.

02:21:29.600 --> 02:21:32.720
Thanks to you, I have gone from being a meek miniscule,

02:21:32.720 --> 02:21:36.080
nothing to the greatest sorcerer alive.

02:21:36.800 --> 02:21:40.560
You cannot stop me now and I have you to thank for it.

02:21:40.560 --> 02:21:43.600
Accept the small gesture of gratitude from me.

02:21:44.960 --> 02:21:48.320
Wait, Vati, wait, you fucking bam.

02:21:49.600 --> 02:21:50.080
Oh, yeah.

02:21:50.640 --> 02:21:51.200
Oh, yeah.

02:21:51.200 --> 02:21:51.920
Oh, yeah, bitch!

02:21:53.360 --> 02:21:56.000
I'm just sp- I'm just spamming, I'm just spamming.

02:21:57.600 --> 02:21:58.480
Okay, it's not that bad.

02:21:58.480 --> 02:21:59.120
It's not that bad.

02:22:01.600 --> 02:22:02.320
Okay, we're fine.

02:22:02.320 --> 02:22:04.240
I wasn't as bad as I anticipated.

02:22:04.240 --> 02:22:05.600
That foul Vati.

02:22:05.600 --> 02:22:06.400
What could he be?

02:22:06.400 --> 02:22:06.880
He?

02:22:10.080 --> 02:22:10.880
He?

02:22:10.880 --> 02:22:11.680
Question mark.

02:22:14.480 --> 02:22:14.800
He?

02:22:15.680 --> 02:22:16.720
Is it not a lady?

02:22:17.840 --> 02:22:19.440
What could he be scheming now?

02:22:20.080 --> 02:22:24.240
Link, I feel I owe you an explanation for what just happened.

02:22:24.240 --> 02:22:27.040
You see, Vati and I are actually both menish.

02:22:27.680 --> 02:22:31.920
I was once a famous sage and a renowned menish craftsman.

02:22:31.920 --> 02:22:33.280
Vati was only a boy.

02:22:33.280 --> 02:22:34.480
Okay, it's definitely a guy.

02:22:35.200 --> 02:22:38.320
Vati was only a boy when it took him in as my apprentice,

02:22:38.320 --> 02:22:42.480
but he became enchanted by the wickedness in the hearts of men.

02:22:42.560 --> 02:22:45.120
One day, Vati took a hat I made for the humans.

02:22:45.120 --> 02:22:46.480
My pride and joy.

02:22:46.480 --> 02:22:48.400
It granted the wishes of its wearer.

02:22:48.400 --> 02:22:50.240
He put it on without my permission, though.

02:22:51.360 --> 02:22:52.880
Am I going to flashback?

02:22:52.880 --> 02:22:54.240
Okay, it's a guy.

02:22:56.080 --> 02:22:57.440
I thought Vati was a chick.

02:22:58.880 --> 02:23:00.640
Vati, what are you doing here?

02:23:01.360 --> 02:23:02.400
Oh my god, that's her hat.

02:23:05.440 --> 02:23:06.160
Oh, yeah.

02:23:08.320 --> 02:23:11.120
Oh, what a vile form you've taken.

02:23:12.720 --> 02:23:16.000
Vio, I can't do an English male voice.

02:23:16.800 --> 02:23:19.040
I need to sound like Phil from EastEnders.

02:23:19.040 --> 02:23:21.360
Vio, I am a sorcerer now,

02:23:21.360 --> 02:23:23.760
and my power is beyond compare.

02:23:23.760 --> 02:23:27.120
No longer will I tire away as your apprentice.

02:23:27.120 --> 02:23:29.760
Now, all shall call me master.

02:23:31.360 --> 02:23:33.520
Wait, Vati, what are you plotting?

02:23:34.720 --> 02:23:37.040
This year, on the day that comes,

02:23:37.040 --> 02:23:40.640
but once a century, the portal opens.

02:23:40.640 --> 02:23:44.720
And when it does, I shall claim the life force as my own.

02:23:44.720 --> 02:23:47.200
I will be transformed, perfect,

02:23:47.200 --> 02:23:49.360
and there will be none who can stop me.

02:23:59.520 --> 02:24:02.400
Oh no, so that's who we have.

02:24:02.960 --> 02:24:07.760
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

02:24:07.760 --> 02:24:11.840
Tell me, how does it feel, why sorcerers kiss?

02:24:11.840 --> 02:24:13.760
Do you see, Eslo?

02:24:13.760 --> 02:24:15.840
I am truly your master now.

02:24:15.840 --> 02:24:19.520
You cannot stop me, and with that, I must believe it.

02:24:23.200 --> 02:24:24.560
And that's how Eslo came to be.

02:24:25.200 --> 02:24:26.880
You know the legends, of course.

02:24:27.520 --> 02:24:30.160
The gift the Pokori gave the humans.

02:24:30.160 --> 02:24:33.200
What you call the Pokori Blade was the first of these gifts.

02:24:33.200 --> 02:24:36.000
The second, well, you call it the light force,

02:24:36.000 --> 02:24:38.720
but it is the source of limitless magic, power.

02:24:39.440 --> 02:24:43.360
If Vati were to be able to get it now, it would be devastating.

02:24:44.320 --> 02:24:47.760
I came to the world of men, hoping to stop Vati,

02:24:47.760 --> 02:24:49.280
and I came to you in the woods.

02:24:50.560 --> 02:24:51.360
You did want that?

02:24:51.920 --> 02:24:55.200
But it seems we won't be breaking the curse any time soon.

02:24:55.200 --> 02:24:57.040
However, with the Sacred Blade,

02:24:57.040 --> 02:24:59.600
we can certainly restore the Princess Zelda.

02:25:00.240 --> 02:25:05.600
I'm sorry, all that has happened has been due to my pride, my folly.

02:25:05.600 --> 02:25:10.000
I must rely on you, on your power, until we put an end to Vati.

02:25:12.320 --> 02:25:12.820
Monk.

02:25:14.960 --> 02:25:17.920
Well, Link, enough fairy tales.

02:25:17.920 --> 02:25:20.000
We must search for the next element.

02:25:23.840 --> 02:25:24.720
I don't know where to go.

02:25:26.320 --> 02:25:28.960
Right, we'll go into town, and then I'll have a little break,

02:25:28.960 --> 02:25:31.200
and I'll go make a tea, okay?

02:25:31.200 --> 02:25:33.440
And you guys can stretch your...

02:25:33.440 --> 02:25:33.940
No.

02:25:36.080 --> 02:25:39.520
Your legs to prevent any issues with your penis.

02:25:39.520 --> 02:25:40.020
Okay.

02:25:41.520 --> 02:25:42.160
Sorry.

02:25:42.160 --> 02:25:43.520
Set that the wrong way around.

02:25:43.520 --> 02:25:46.000
You're to stretch your legs so you don't have any issues.

02:25:46.000 --> 02:25:48.800
I will leave the game running in the background,

02:25:48.800 --> 02:25:50.880
whilst I go get my Koopa save.

02:25:52.240 --> 02:25:53.200
Already lost.

02:25:53.200 --> 02:25:54.720
We didn't even get started.

02:25:56.160 --> 02:25:57.440
Stretch the tentacle.

02:25:58.320 --> 02:26:01.280
Right, I'll leave the game so you guys can appreciate the music

02:26:01.280 --> 02:26:01.920
for what it's worth.

02:26:01.920 --> 02:26:03.520
This game is very adorable.

02:26:03.520 --> 02:26:05.200
We are already two elements.

02:26:05.200 --> 02:26:06.800
We are about to go for the third.

02:26:08.080 --> 02:26:10.560
If I'm not mistaken, the shoe shop should be open,

02:26:10.560 --> 02:26:12.640
because I've just remembered where we're heading next.

02:26:13.760 --> 02:26:16.240
Please do grab a snack, get some hydration,

02:26:16.240 --> 02:26:17.600
do go for a tinkle as well.

02:26:17.600 --> 02:26:19.200
It's not good to hold in your bladder.

02:26:19.200 --> 02:26:20.720
The only reason I don't need to pee a lot

02:26:20.720 --> 02:26:23.600
is because I am severely dehydrated.

02:26:23.600 --> 02:26:24.320
Let's go.

02:26:24.320 --> 02:26:25.920
We love severely dehydrated.

02:26:25.920 --> 02:26:27.680
I mean, you never have to go for breaks.

02:26:29.520 --> 02:26:31.200
But yes, get some snacks.

02:26:31.200 --> 02:26:32.080
I will get some too.

02:26:32.080 --> 02:26:33.360
I will be a couple of minutes,

02:26:33.360 --> 02:26:34.720
but I shan't be long.

02:26:34.720 --> 02:26:35.760
Okay, I shan't be long.

02:26:37.360 --> 02:26:38.800
T-minus warning for

02:26:40.560 --> 02:26:40.960
Emi?

02:26:42.080 --> 02:26:42.960
Question mark?

02:26:42.960 --> 02:26:45.200
Emi coming on in one hour 20?

02:26:45.200 --> 02:26:46.160
Question mark?

02:26:46.160 --> 02:26:46.800
I think.

02:26:46.800 --> 02:26:47.440
I'm not sure.

02:26:50.320 --> 02:26:51.600
I should be able to redirect,

02:26:51.600 --> 02:26:53.280
whichever issue it is.

02:26:53.280 --> 02:26:54.880
I can't remember what game you're playing, Emi.

02:26:54.880 --> 02:26:56.960
I know you've got a collab this week on...

02:26:57.920 --> 02:26:58.800
No, don't talk.

02:26:58.800 --> 02:26:59.680
Nobody explodes.

02:27:02.880 --> 02:27:04.080
Yes, I'll be back in a moment.

02:27:04.080 --> 02:27:05.440
Give me a few minutes, okay?

02:29:24.880 --> 02:29:27.120
Are you squinting me right now?

02:30:54.880 --> 02:30:57.120
Do you want me to do it again?

02:30:57.120 --> 02:30:59.360
Do you want me to do it again?

02:30:59.360 --> 02:31:01.360
Do you want me to do it again?

02:31:01.360 --> 02:31:03.360
Do you want me to do it again?

02:31:03.360 --> 02:31:05.360
Do you want me to do it again?

02:31:05.360 --> 02:31:07.360
Do you want me to do it again?

02:31:07.360 --> 02:31:09.360
Do you want me to do it again?

02:31:09.360 --> 02:31:11.360
Do you want me to do it again?

02:31:11.360 --> 02:31:13.360
Do you want me to do it again?

02:31:13.360 --> 02:31:15.360
Do you want me to do it again?

02:31:15.360 --> 02:31:17.360

Where my god?

02:36:55.360 --> 02:36:57.360
Gimli and Beato came flying around the corner

02:36:57.360 --> 02:37:01.360
I was like ooo

02:37:01.360 --> 02:37:03.360
I may or may not have forgotten to feed them this morning

02:37:03.360 --> 02:37:05.360
Eps

02:37:05.360 --> 02:37:06.400

02:37:06.400 --> 02:37:08.400
Have back

02:37:08.400 --> 02:37:11.720
So, I'm eating leftovers, and I was like,

02:37:11.720 --> 02:37:13.680
hurry, hurry, hurry, the ruffles are waiting,

02:37:13.680 --> 02:37:16.320
the ruffles are waiting, and I was pouring cheese,

02:37:16.320 --> 02:37:18.000
like a wee bit of grated cheese on it,

02:37:18.000 --> 02:37:20.040
the entire bag fell out on the meal,

02:37:20.040 --> 02:37:22.280
and I'm like, are you effing kidding me right now?

02:37:22.280 --> 02:37:25.160
Like the kettle's boiling, cats are body-me-amming.

02:37:26.240 --> 02:37:27.680
I'm like, oh my god, the poor ruffles

02:37:27.680 --> 02:37:29.880
are just sitting on this freaking title screen.

02:37:31.920 --> 02:37:33.800
I didn't understand a single word by a gray,

02:37:33.800 --> 02:37:35.560
thank you, thank you for agreeing.

02:37:35.560 --> 02:37:37.600
Right, I'm saying something like that too.

02:37:38.720 --> 02:37:42.640
Okay, T minus one hour 30,

02:37:42.640 --> 02:37:45.760
and then part one of Minish Cap is complete.

02:37:47.560 --> 02:37:49.920
I do have a warm, I've actually got a cola.

02:37:52.760 --> 02:37:55.960
Love me cola, I do, I do.

02:37:55.960 --> 02:37:58.800
I was so scared, well, because I was away.

02:38:01.600 --> 02:38:04.000
Right, we need to check out the shoe shop,

02:38:04.000 --> 02:38:06.480
because I believe this is where we're heading next.

02:38:06.480 --> 02:38:10.960
Yes, hello, was that, oh, welcome,

02:38:10.960 --> 02:38:13.280
welcome to Rem's shoe shop.

02:38:13.280 --> 02:38:14.880
Lately, whenever I take a nap,

02:38:14.880 --> 02:38:16.360
all my shoes are done when I wake up,

02:38:16.360 --> 02:38:18.520
you know, if I can make shoes in my sleep,

02:38:18.520 --> 02:38:20.400
I must be in the right job.

02:38:20.400 --> 02:38:24.400
However, things are not as it seems, no, no, no.

02:38:26.360 --> 02:38:30.120
We're gonna take out, oh yeah, piss.

02:38:30.120 --> 02:38:31.800
Yeah, I can't reach it.

02:38:31.800 --> 02:38:34.360
Okay, 70 AM cola, literally.

02:38:37.480 --> 02:38:40.160
Actually, I can't believe I'm saying this.

02:38:40.160 --> 02:38:43.280
I have to actually work after I finish the stream.

02:38:43.280 --> 02:38:44.520
Well, the other stream as well.

02:38:44.520 --> 02:38:45.880
Wait, is everything open now?

02:38:45.880 --> 02:38:46.720
No.

02:38:48.320 --> 02:38:49.400
Okay, it's not open.

02:38:51.520 --> 02:38:55.640
Oh, right, is the library open now?

02:38:55.640 --> 02:38:56.800
Question mark.

02:38:58.520 --> 02:39:00.080
No, that's the school.

02:39:00.080 --> 02:39:01.400
No, it's not open.

02:39:02.360 --> 02:39:07.200
There's a little mini-pot up there, oh yeah.

02:39:10.080 --> 02:39:13.800
Am I supposed to go down and discover the swamp

02:39:13.800 --> 02:39:16.360
and then come back to the town, possibly?

02:39:17.840 --> 02:39:19.320
Very probable.

02:39:19.320 --> 02:39:21.120
So you don't consider streaming work.

02:39:22.120 --> 02:39:23.720
This ain't work.

02:39:23.720 --> 02:39:26.240
I thought this ain't work.

02:39:27.200 --> 02:39:28.040
This is not work.

02:39:28.120 --> 02:39:30.160
I absolutely, hello.

02:39:30.160 --> 02:39:32.160
Oh, hello, my brother's at school, okay.

02:39:33.680 --> 02:39:37.320
Failed the bench delt test or whatever the freaking thing is.

02:39:37.320 --> 02:39:40.320
I can't remember what it was, but I was laughing my ass off

02:39:40.320 --> 02:39:43.400
because Lord of the Rings fails the bench delt test.

02:39:46.720 --> 02:39:49.160
And I was like, oh, it's still a good movie, who cares?

02:39:50.440 --> 02:39:53.120
I was like, where the heck am I supposed to do it?

02:39:53.120 --> 02:39:54.640
Right, I think we're just to go to the swamp

02:39:54.640 --> 02:39:56.920
and discover that we can walk in.

02:39:56.920 --> 02:39:59.880
The bench delt test, it's like a test

02:39:59.880 --> 02:40:04.880
and it's like, if two lambs speak to each other,

02:40:05.360 --> 02:40:08.560
but it's not about a man, then it passes.

02:40:09.400 --> 02:40:11.400
And it seems like such a small thing,

02:40:11.400 --> 02:40:14.000
but it never happens in movies

02:40:14.000 --> 02:40:16.920
because obviously movies have to be centered around the plot.

02:40:16.920 --> 02:40:19.720
Right, I guess I have to go all the way up and into the thing.

02:40:21.640 --> 02:40:23.680
So it's quite humorous.

02:40:23.680 --> 02:40:25.400
Don't take it too seriously.

02:40:25.440 --> 02:40:27.640
People don't really take it too seriously.

02:40:27.640 --> 02:40:30.200
It's fucking relax, it's not that serious.

02:40:30.200 --> 02:40:32.760
Two named women characters talk to each other

02:40:32.760 --> 02:40:33.800
something other than that.

02:40:33.800 --> 02:40:36.280
Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's like something funny like that.

02:40:36.280 --> 02:40:39.760
And it's like, a lot of things fail it, which is hilarious.

02:40:41.080 --> 02:40:44.000
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, wait, double drop.

02:40:44.000 --> 02:40:46.760
Hello, is the game feeling nice?

02:40:46.760 --> 02:40:48.360
Is there like more under here?

02:40:49.640 --> 02:40:52.040
I'll start picking these up if I get a piece.

02:40:53.040 --> 02:40:56.880
Is the game feeling bad for not giving me them?

02:40:56.880 --> 02:40:58.480
Good, because it should feel bad.

02:41:00.480 --> 02:41:02.240
Mummy, can we do a Lord of the Rings watch long?

02:41:02.240 --> 02:41:06.000
Yes, you're actually doing it with me

02:41:06.000 --> 02:41:08.280
on Christmas Day and Boxing Day.

02:41:08.280 --> 02:41:09.640
We're doing Lord of the Rings first,

02:41:09.640 --> 02:41:11.280
and then we're doing the Hobbit.

02:41:12.560 --> 02:41:16.160
Just because I am aware that

02:41:16.160 --> 02:41:19.520
Crumble Time can be a bit sore, a bit not fun.

02:41:19.520 --> 02:41:21.360
Whoa, blue.

02:41:21.360 --> 02:41:24.520
Whoa, you got those guys.

02:41:24.520 --> 02:41:27.680
Wait, I'm cutting the grass, I'm cutting the grass.

02:41:27.680 --> 02:41:29.040
Oh my God, oh my God,

02:41:29.040 --> 02:41:31.600
the game's feeling so nice right now, what the heck?

02:41:31.600 --> 02:41:33.040
I'm cutting the grass, I'm cutting the grass.

02:41:33.040 --> 02:41:35.200
Hold on, let me cut the grass.

02:41:35.200 --> 02:41:38.200
You don't understand, I need to cut all the grass right now.

02:41:38.200 --> 02:41:39.600
I'll grab that shell though.

02:41:41.040 --> 02:41:42.920
And we're getting money for doing it too.

02:41:42.920 --> 02:41:44.160
I wasn't kidding when this,

02:41:44.160 --> 02:41:46.400
this is literally grass cut simulator.

02:41:48.000 --> 02:41:50.280
Oh my God, there's so many.

02:41:50.280 --> 02:41:53.640
Hold on, we might actually have to go back to town

02:41:53.640 --> 02:41:55.600
if it's given me that much.

02:42:00.400 --> 02:42:01.920
What's in here?

02:42:01.920 --> 02:42:05.240
A red piece, oh, someone wanted to trade us a red piece.

02:42:05.240 --> 02:42:07.880
Oh no, but I can't remember the location.

02:42:09.840 --> 02:42:14.840
Hey, it's me, it's the two-year reefing badge, no it's not.

02:42:15.040 --> 02:42:17.600
Oh right, cause it's a, sorry, sorry, I was like,

02:42:18.440 --> 02:42:21.320
I was like, that is impossible,

02:42:21.320 --> 02:42:23.080
unless we've got time traveling here.

02:42:24.280 --> 02:42:25.640
We're cutting the grass.

02:42:25.640 --> 02:42:28.440
I assume if it stops giving us stones,

02:42:28.440 --> 02:42:31.480
then it stops, right, what's in here?

02:42:32.720 --> 02:42:35.520
Oh hello, hello, I am Percy,

02:42:35.520 --> 02:42:38.120
poet literature of Hyrule,

02:42:38.120 --> 02:42:39.920
and you are Link, sorry I skip that.

02:42:39.920 --> 02:42:41.400
I travel all over the realm,

02:42:41.400 --> 02:42:43.360
writing verses wherever I go,

02:42:43.360 --> 02:42:45.720
but here I am, returning after a long absence,

02:42:45.720 --> 02:42:47.760
only to find the road blocked.

02:42:47.760 --> 02:42:49.320
It wouldn't feel like such a waste

02:42:49.320 --> 02:42:51.680
if I hadn't lost half of my kinstone,

02:42:51.680 --> 02:42:53.640
where misfortune rains down upon my head

02:42:53.640 --> 02:42:54.960
at pores and torrents.

02:42:54.960 --> 02:42:56.800
I think I may have dropped it in the inn

02:42:56.800 --> 02:42:58.680
I stayed in last night.

02:42:58.680 --> 02:43:00.280
I see no other course than to put

02:43:00.280 --> 02:43:02.200
these tragic events to verse.

02:43:02.200 --> 02:43:04.040
I see stars beyond the rainbow,

02:43:04.040 --> 02:43:05.920
but I cannot reach them.

02:43:05.920 --> 02:43:08.200
Through the stone, though the stone out,

02:43:08.200 --> 02:43:12.120
I lost a small, large wizards placing my heart.

02:43:12.120 --> 02:43:15.040
Okay, I need to go back to the inn.

02:43:15.760 --> 02:43:18.320
Is that why it's giving me all these kinstone pieces?

02:43:20.200 --> 02:43:23.280
Ah, looks like my drop rate's changed,

02:43:23.280 --> 02:43:26.480
so I think I might have to go trade people.

02:43:29.320 --> 02:43:31.600
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na.

02:43:31.600 --> 02:43:32.920
Oh, sorry.

02:43:32.920 --> 02:43:35.680
Sorry, oh, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, pal.

02:43:36.880 --> 02:43:39.240
Right, we're gonna unlock this route,

02:43:39.240 --> 02:43:41.920
because that's literally in my way, it's in my way,

02:43:41.920 --> 02:43:42.920
it's in my way.

02:43:43.920 --> 02:43:45.640
Please, I need to pick up.

02:43:45.640 --> 02:43:46.960
Maybe there's a hidden thing.

02:43:46.960 --> 02:43:50.200
No, it was an old man.

02:43:51.640 --> 02:43:53.880
All right, drop rate is definitely changed.

02:43:55.560 --> 02:43:59.040
Oh, oh, we've got a little cutscene moment.

02:43:59.040 --> 02:44:00.760
Eh, what a strange feeling.

02:44:00.760 --> 02:44:03.440
I sense something from the castle's direction,

02:44:03.440 --> 02:44:04.680
or was it just me?

02:44:04.680 --> 02:44:06.640
Oh, we need to go back to the castle?

02:44:07.640 --> 02:44:12.600
Oh, Phil from EastEnders, right, let's go.

02:44:16.080 --> 02:44:18.160
Oh, who's there?

02:44:19.320 --> 02:44:22.120
Eh, Vati, how did you get in here?

02:44:23.120 --> 02:44:25.280
I don't know how to do an English voice.

02:44:26.960 --> 02:44:29.440
Monka, instead of walking the teleport,

02:44:29.440 --> 02:44:30.920
talk about being lazy.

02:44:31.920 --> 02:44:34.000
Uh, what are you doing?

02:44:34.920 --> 02:44:38.960
Eh, given that sloppy toppy, clearly.

02:44:38.960 --> 02:44:39.800
Jesus.

02:44:41.320 --> 02:44:42.400
What did he do?

02:44:42.400 --> 02:44:43.240
Eh?

02:44:45.840 --> 02:44:48.200
Oh, he infected the...

02:44:48.200 --> 02:44:49.600
It looks like you're all here.

02:44:49.600 --> 02:44:52.680
Very well, the king of Hyrule has words for you.

02:44:52.680 --> 02:44:55.120
You all know the power of the Pokora gave to mankind,

02:44:55.120 --> 02:44:55.960
do you not?

02:44:55.960 --> 02:44:58.480
The golden light force of limitless magical power.

02:44:58.480 --> 02:45:00.280
I want it, it's somewhere here in Hyrule,

02:45:00.280 --> 02:45:02.040
go now and bring me this power.

02:45:03.040 --> 02:45:06.640
Waste no time, go forth at once and bring me the light force.

02:45:06.640 --> 02:45:10.960
Oh no, Vati made the king go crazy.

02:45:10.960 --> 02:45:13.520
Fling anyone who refuses into the dungeon,

02:45:13.520 --> 02:45:15.520
him and his family too, oh, North Korea.

02:45:15.520 --> 02:45:17.600
I will tolerate no disobedience,

02:45:17.600 --> 02:45:20.360
now search high and low throughout the lands of Hyrule.

02:45:22.360 --> 02:45:23.440
What do they think?

02:45:23.440 --> 02:45:27.200
Maybe it's just the wind, but I hope nothing bad has happened.

02:45:27.200 --> 02:45:29.840
Anyway, we need to look for the next element.

02:45:29.840 --> 02:45:31.920
The map says it should be around here somewhere.

02:45:32.000 --> 02:45:33.840
Yes, it must be around here.

02:45:33.840 --> 02:45:35.160
Pinstone pieces?

02:45:35.160 --> 02:45:36.000
Nope.

02:45:37.160 --> 02:45:41.120
Gami is getting poised to attack me and see...

02:45:41.120 --> 02:45:42.800
Did they just keep flying or did they go...

02:45:42.800 --> 02:45:45.640
Whoa, you don't even have to do anything to them?

02:45:48.360 --> 02:45:49.960
Hold on, that's money.

02:45:49.960 --> 02:45:52.800
Oh wait, I can get a new wallet if I get 80.

02:45:52.800 --> 02:45:54.800
Hold on, let's see if I can get 80 coins,

02:45:54.800 --> 02:45:56.600
that might go down quite well.

02:45:57.840 --> 02:46:00.560
Okay, we're gonna go get a new wallet and trade the people,

02:46:00.560 --> 02:46:04.240
because there was quite a few trades that I couldn't do.

02:46:05.360 --> 02:46:07.560
Well, I think I'm not...

02:46:07.560 --> 02:46:08.640
He's really unruly.

02:46:10.480 --> 02:46:12.040
So the light force is some kind of treasure,

02:46:12.040 --> 02:46:14.840
I can get anywhere, the king must be looking for it.

02:46:14.840 --> 02:46:15.680
Right, not you.

02:46:16.600 --> 02:46:17.760
You?

02:46:17.760 --> 02:46:18.600
You.

02:46:20.120 --> 02:46:21.200
Yes.

02:46:21.200 --> 02:46:23.240
Can I have this one please?

02:46:23.240 --> 02:46:25.040
Two pinstones, but carefully together.

02:46:25.040 --> 02:46:27.040
Hold on, I'm gonna bring my food over

02:46:27.040 --> 02:46:29.120
because I don't want it to get too cold.

02:46:29.120 --> 02:46:31.920
Whoa, chest, just a chest, okay, that's fine.

02:46:33.400 --> 02:46:36.560
Okay, I'm mixing in my stupendous amount of cheese

02:46:36.560 --> 02:46:38.680
for the pasta, hold here.

02:46:38.680 --> 02:46:39.680
It's not looking good.

02:46:40.960 --> 02:46:43.680
Hey, they fit perfectly, I wonder what's gonna happen.

02:46:43.680 --> 02:46:44.880
I get a chest.

02:46:44.880 --> 02:46:46.080
Do you trade me?

02:46:46.080 --> 02:46:46.920
No, you're done.

02:46:46.920 --> 02:46:47.760
How about you?

02:46:47.760 --> 02:46:49.280
Everyone still relies here, it's a good thing.

02:46:49.280 --> 02:46:52.240
My ideal cafe is a place where everyone can just hang out, yeah.

02:46:52.240 --> 02:46:53.080
How about you?

02:46:54.000 --> 02:46:55.200
You wanna fuse pinstone?

02:46:55.200 --> 02:46:56.040
Yeah!

02:46:59.200 --> 02:47:00.680
Like a four-leaf clover,

02:47:00.680 --> 02:47:02.680
where did you end up meeting a spaghetti?

02:47:04.120 --> 02:47:05.120
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

02:47:11.560 --> 02:47:13.640
That wasn't what we needed.

02:47:15.080 --> 02:47:16.320
When he said N,

02:47:18.720 --> 02:47:20.320
oh, the postman!

02:47:20.320 --> 02:47:24.160
Oh, wait, wait, I'm not a Mr. Postman.

02:47:24.160 --> 02:47:28.160
Baby, I'm a Mr. Postman.

02:47:28.160 --> 02:47:29.000
Oh!

02:47:29.720 --> 02:47:30.560
What's this?

02:47:34.920 --> 02:47:36.800
I really wish I could do more to help people.

02:47:36.800 --> 02:47:39.120
Wait, I've got it, I'll ask swiftly

02:47:39.120 --> 02:47:41.480
to start up a newsletter for adventures.

02:47:41.480 --> 02:47:43.320
That'll be a great way to create a useful service

02:47:43.320 --> 02:47:44.320
for everyone, hmm.

02:47:44.320 --> 02:47:45.600
It's going to be a lot of work though.

02:47:45.600 --> 02:47:47.680
I should get Marcy to help me.

02:47:49.320 --> 02:47:50.160
Marcy?

02:47:51.400 --> 02:47:53.040
Help, a fish quiz.

02:47:54.040 --> 02:47:59.040
I have no, I don't have no recollection.

02:48:00.760 --> 02:48:02.960
Whoa, there's a new guy in town.

02:48:04.880 --> 02:48:06.280
We've got so much fusing.

02:48:08.200 --> 02:48:09.640
Hey, did you talk to your mage?

02:48:11.520 --> 02:48:13.880
Oh, is a Wind Waker reference?

02:48:13.880 --> 02:48:15.560
I don't know.

02:48:15.560 --> 02:48:16.720
Another chess, okay.

02:48:20.600 --> 02:48:21.440
Delicious.

02:48:22.440 --> 02:48:23.680
I'm nutritious.

02:48:25.480 --> 02:48:28.040
Hey, they fit perfectly, this will be good.

02:48:28.040 --> 02:48:29.800
Hello, what do you sell?

02:48:31.240 --> 02:48:32.640
Why, hello there, thanks for coming by.

02:48:32.640 --> 02:48:35.320
I sell all kinds of pickle, like,

02:48:35.320 --> 02:48:37.120
I just put in your bottle and get some patterns

02:48:37.120 --> 02:48:38.040
when you drink it.

02:48:38.040 --> 02:48:41.120
Hmm, I only drink stuff that reeflings give me,

02:48:41.120 --> 02:48:43.160
if I'm gonna be honest.

02:48:43.160 --> 02:48:45.120
Oh no, I don't have it, ugh.

02:48:46.880 --> 02:48:48.880
Um, no, there was.

02:48:49.720 --> 02:48:50.560
Oh man.

02:48:53.560 --> 02:48:56.880
Ah, I don't have it, it's not that red piece, draught.

02:48:58.160 --> 02:48:59.480
Ah, not you.

02:49:00.360 --> 02:49:03.120
There was someone here that wanted to,

02:49:03.120 --> 02:49:05.160
oh, I just put a bomb down in front of this guy's house.

02:49:05.160 --> 02:49:06.640
Sorry mate, it didn't mean that.

02:49:06.640 --> 02:49:09.280
Ah, do apologize, don't have it either.

02:49:10.680 --> 02:49:12.480
It's not a change of heart.

02:49:13.480 --> 02:49:15.960
I'm just committing war crimes, okay, geez.

02:49:19.040 --> 02:49:20.640
Oh, can I fuse you?

02:49:20.640 --> 02:49:21.640
No.

02:49:21.640 --> 02:49:23.320
Oh wait, did I go back to the sword master?

02:49:23.320 --> 02:49:24.520
Can I, was it you?

02:49:25.680 --> 02:49:27.680
Well, I can fuse with them, so I'll take it.

02:49:29.520 --> 02:49:32.400
Oh, the money bag, yes, sorry, I already forgot, geez.

02:49:33.720 --> 02:49:35.600
Hmm, I'll grab that now.

02:49:37.440 --> 02:49:38.960
Ooh, what's this, quite nice.

02:49:41.600 --> 02:49:42.440
A chest.

02:49:49.000 --> 02:49:52.240
Oh, oh, move on, move on, move on, move on.

02:49:52.240 --> 02:49:53.680
They fit perfectly, time to celebrate.

02:49:53.680 --> 02:49:56.040
I don't think these guys can do anything for me.

02:49:56.040 --> 02:49:58.640
Right, we'll go get the,

02:49:58.640 --> 02:50:00.280
sorry, I'm playing one handed right now,

02:50:00.280 --> 02:50:01.960
I would go faster if I'm eating.

02:50:05.160 --> 02:50:07.760
I'm trying to eat and progress the story at the same time.

02:50:08.600 --> 02:50:12.240
Um, right, first get the rupee bag,

02:50:13.320 --> 02:50:16.000
because then we can hold more rupees in general.

02:50:16.000 --> 02:50:17.320
No, not that one.

02:50:17.320 --> 02:50:18.160
No.

02:50:19.640 --> 02:50:23.440
Mm, mm, mm, mm, mm, mm, mm, mm, mm.

02:50:23.440 --> 02:50:25.240
Hello, may I please have this?

02:50:26.520 --> 02:50:28.320
Only 80 rupees for a wallet,

02:50:28.320 --> 02:50:31.760
it can hold a king's ransom by, yes.

02:50:33.320 --> 02:50:35.720
Yo, now you can carry more rupees, perfect.

02:50:35.720 --> 02:50:37.400
Much obliged, my good lad.

02:50:38.520 --> 02:50:41.920
Much obliged, I have more, I do have more.

02:50:41.920 --> 02:50:45.360
Whoa, I didn't realize you could even go and see

02:50:45.640 --> 02:50:46.760
inside the bag.

02:50:46.760 --> 02:50:49.960
The reason why I'm asking if I have water is this.

02:50:52.240 --> 02:50:54.120
Literally, you'd never figure it out on your own,

02:50:54.120 --> 02:50:55.120
it's impossible.

02:50:57.240 --> 02:50:58.080
Do you want to trade?

02:50:58.080 --> 02:51:00.560
My dog's real smart and a little spoiled too.

02:51:00.560 --> 02:51:02.880
Aw, that's what you're supposed to do.

02:51:02.880 --> 02:51:04.800
You're supposed to, let's go talk to the dog.

02:51:04.800 --> 02:51:08.400
Hello, oh, you want to, the dog has a fricking,

02:51:08.400 --> 02:51:10.520
aw, it's always the one I don't have.

02:51:12.840 --> 02:51:14.440
Some might even take a swipe at you.

02:51:14.440 --> 02:51:16.240
Okay, this dog's nice.

02:51:16.240 --> 02:51:17.800
Oh, God.

02:51:17.800 --> 02:51:19.920
See, this is why you're supposed to go like that.

02:51:19.920 --> 02:51:21.200
Wait.

02:51:21.200 --> 02:51:22.800
Oh, no.

02:51:22.800 --> 02:51:24.440
Whoa, did you see that cat looking at me?

02:51:24.440 --> 02:51:25.920
I know it wants a piece of me.

02:51:26.920 --> 02:51:29.800
This is for a later quest, which we're not on right now

02:51:29.800 --> 02:51:32.040
because I'm going too far ahead of the plot.

02:51:32.880 --> 02:51:33.720
Oops.

02:51:34.720 --> 02:51:36.120
He's a good boy.

02:51:37.040 --> 02:51:38.360
Just like a replay.

02:51:39.800 --> 02:51:42.360
You're such a good doggy replay, you're the one.

02:51:43.360 --> 02:51:45.640
Can I go in now?

02:51:45.640 --> 02:51:46.680
Finally.

02:51:46.680 --> 02:51:50.800
Right, I'm to trade someone in the end.

02:51:52.400 --> 02:51:53.640
Must be upstairs.

02:51:59.840 --> 02:52:00.840
Is it you?

02:52:02.560 --> 02:52:05.720
And you asked for the one I don't have.

02:52:05.720 --> 02:52:07.160
Is it one of the children?

02:52:08.240 --> 02:52:10.600
Stop asking for the ones I don't have.

02:52:11.480 --> 02:52:12.320
Right now.

02:52:15.560 --> 02:52:16.760
What's going to happen?

02:52:16.760 --> 02:52:18.960
I need to inhale my food, it's getting cold.

02:52:22.400 --> 02:52:24.160
Okay, that's a later platform.

02:52:29.680 --> 02:52:31.440
Okay, is that...

02:52:31.440 --> 02:52:32.280
Oh, you?

02:52:34.760 --> 02:52:36.120
Okay, can do it, can do it.

02:52:36.120 --> 02:52:37.320
I'm gonna have to go in the grass

02:52:37.320 --> 02:52:39.240
and look for more pinstone.

02:52:41.600 --> 02:52:42.440
Hmm.

02:52:45.160 --> 02:52:46.280
A chest again?

02:52:46.280 --> 02:52:48.440
Okay, it looks like green is all chest.

02:52:49.520 --> 02:52:50.360
Oh, wait.

02:52:52.200 --> 02:52:55.360
Some sort of monetary gain as I choke on my food.

02:52:56.280 --> 02:52:57.120
Gah.

02:52:57.920 --> 02:52:59.800
Okay, can't go out there yet

02:52:59.800 --> 02:53:01.400
because we don't have a light, which is fine.

02:53:01.400 --> 02:53:03.120
Is there anyone in here?

02:53:03.120 --> 02:53:04.360
No, there's not, okay.

02:53:05.400 --> 02:53:07.480
Right, we need to go get pinstones

02:53:07.480 --> 02:53:09.400
so we can unlock this next section.

02:53:11.600 --> 02:53:13.880
Because we can't frickin' progress.

02:53:17.480 --> 02:53:19.320
I'm even sure what to do.

02:53:19.320 --> 02:53:21.800
I'm pretty sure there's a tingle man down here.

02:53:24.840 --> 02:53:25.680
What?

02:53:25.680 --> 02:53:26.520
Yeah, there he is.

02:53:27.960 --> 02:53:29.640
Let's go see this tingle man.

02:53:29.640 --> 02:53:30.880
Hello, tingle man.

02:53:30.880 --> 02:53:32.880
Yeah, I wanna fuse pinstone.

02:53:32.880 --> 02:53:35.040
And do you want the one I actually have?

02:53:35.040 --> 02:53:36.280
I like it here.

02:53:36.280 --> 02:53:37.480
I'm like maneuver.

02:53:39.200 --> 02:53:40.040
Oh.

02:53:41.440 --> 02:53:42.280
Oh.

02:53:43.840 --> 02:53:45.920
Okay, we'll definitely go investigate that

02:53:45.920 --> 02:53:46.920
because that's cool.

02:53:48.920 --> 02:53:49.920
They fit perfectly.

02:53:49.920 --> 02:53:50.760
Thank you.

02:53:53.320 --> 02:53:56.120
Right, we're gonna go get this.

02:53:56.120 --> 02:53:56.960
What is it?

02:53:56.960 --> 02:53:58.720
200 shells.

02:53:58.720 --> 02:54:00.800
I better not be full with shells.

02:54:00.800 --> 02:54:01.640
No, I'm not.

02:54:01.640 --> 02:54:02.480
That's fine.

02:54:02.480 --> 02:54:04.280
I don't wanna waste shells.

02:54:04.280 --> 02:54:05.360
I'd rather go gamble.

02:54:06.320 --> 02:54:07.640
Yes!

02:54:07.640 --> 02:54:08.480
Right, okay.

02:54:08.480 --> 02:54:10.120
I guess I'm just not allowed to have

02:54:10.120 --> 02:54:11.680
a certain amount on my person

02:54:11.680 --> 02:54:13.520
or the game is like that's too many

02:54:13.520 --> 02:54:15.640
and not fun anymore.

02:54:16.880 --> 02:54:18.800
Grass cutting simulator.

02:54:18.800 --> 02:54:21.160
Grass cutting simulator.

02:54:21.160 --> 02:54:23.960
Simulator, grass cutting simulator.

02:54:25.920 --> 02:54:29.440
I don't wanna go back to the guy with only one.

02:54:29.440 --> 02:54:30.880
That's so small.

02:54:32.840 --> 02:54:33.840
That's so little.

02:54:35.280 --> 02:54:36.440
What's over here?

02:54:38.960 --> 02:54:40.720
Oh, we don't have access to it yet.

02:54:45.040 --> 02:54:47.920
Did I go as far as I could back then?

02:54:50.520 --> 02:54:53.080
Or am I gonna have to go to that area?

02:54:53.080 --> 02:54:54.360
Just to cut grass.

02:54:54.360 --> 02:54:56.960
Literally making my way over there just to cut grass.

02:55:01.120 --> 02:55:02.440
Dingle, dingle, dingle.

02:55:05.160 --> 02:55:07.920
Am I going extra crazy?

02:55:07.960 --> 02:55:09.760
Oh my God, I'm going extra crazy.

02:55:10.600 --> 02:55:11.960
This is where I'm supposed to go.

02:55:11.960 --> 02:55:13.320
I don't need to do anything.

02:55:16.000 --> 02:55:17.600
Ah!

02:55:17.600 --> 02:55:18.440
Strat.

02:55:19.320 --> 02:55:20.160
This is it.

02:55:21.160 --> 02:55:22.600
So, this must be, sorry,

02:55:22.600 --> 02:55:25.120
I'm burning myself with my whole war ball right now.

02:55:25.120 --> 02:55:26.880
So this must be Caster Wilds.

02:55:26.880 --> 02:55:31.880
It's a nasty dank place filled with swamp land and mirror.

02:55:32.200 --> 02:55:33.840
Mirror, mire?

02:55:33.840 --> 02:55:36.440
But we know there's an element waiting for us.

02:55:36.440 --> 02:55:37.920
Come on, Link, let's go.

02:55:44.720 --> 02:55:47.640
I don't think we can walk fast enough to cross the swamp.

02:55:47.640 --> 02:55:50.400
We're gonna have to find some way to get across safely.

02:55:50.400 --> 02:55:53.080
Okay, I think now that we've done that,

02:55:53.080 --> 02:55:56.760
it means we can go to the shoe shop guy again.

02:55:57.720 --> 02:56:02.480
Kingstone can be grander than RuneScape, honestly?

02:56:02.480 --> 02:56:06.360
Right, now the shoe shop guy will entertain us.

02:56:06.400 --> 02:56:09.880
Or the event will occur, like, that's supposed to happen.

02:56:09.880 --> 02:56:11.200
Oh!

02:56:11.200 --> 02:56:13.240
They dropped 20!

02:56:13.240 --> 02:56:15.120
Parish right now, give me more money.

02:56:17.560 --> 02:56:18.880
So then what was down here?

02:56:22.720 --> 02:56:23.640
Did I just get to be?

02:56:23.640 --> 02:56:26.640
I don't think I can go any further when I can.

02:56:33.080 --> 02:56:34.920
Kingstone, kingstone, kingstone.

02:56:35.520 --> 02:56:36.360
Is that?

02:56:39.080 --> 02:56:40.000
Am I losing it?

02:56:40.000 --> 02:56:40.840
Am I losing it?

02:56:40.840 --> 02:56:43.960
Did I just think I couldn't go any further when I could?

02:56:43.960 --> 02:56:45.400
Oh, my guys.

02:56:45.400 --> 02:56:47.160
I'm not gonna make it.

02:56:47.160 --> 02:56:48.600
Hello?

02:56:48.600 --> 02:56:49.800
I planted it being near my house,

02:56:49.800 --> 02:56:51.280
but it just doesn't seem to grow.

02:56:51.280 --> 02:56:54.360
No, it won't, because I need to kingstone it.

02:56:55.360 --> 02:56:56.520
Wow.

02:56:56.520 --> 02:56:58.280
The mysterious shells are worse.

02:57:00.360 --> 02:57:02.200
I'm almost there.

02:57:02.200 --> 02:57:04.680
Doomsday, Dan, thank you for the tip.

02:57:04.680 --> 02:57:06.400
You didn't put a message though.

02:57:06.400 --> 02:57:07.400
Find and read out.

02:57:08.720 --> 02:57:10.920
And delay lover, I don't think I said your name again.

02:57:10.920 --> 02:57:12.360
Delay lover, be a lure.

02:57:12.360 --> 02:57:13.920
I'll figure you identify yourself.

02:57:17.320 --> 02:57:18.320
I'm almost there now.

02:57:19.400 --> 02:57:22.160
You're gonna have to put up with my tune, okay?

02:57:22.160 --> 02:57:23.000
I can't.

02:57:24.480 --> 02:57:25.960
I can't do everything.

02:57:25.960 --> 02:57:26.800
I don't know.

02:57:30.600 --> 02:57:31.920
I just don't know.

02:57:35.320 --> 02:57:36.320
You didn't go any further.

02:57:36.320 --> 02:57:37.480
Just assumed you couldn't.

02:57:37.480 --> 02:57:39.320
Oh, my God.

02:57:39.320 --> 02:57:40.960
Talk about giving up, Mentale.

02:57:43.840 --> 02:57:44.680
Wow.

02:57:46.400 --> 02:57:47.600
Oh, it's like choke.

02:57:48.600 --> 02:57:51.160
I'm swallowing, I'm swallowing, I'm choking, I'm choking.

02:57:54.160 --> 02:57:55.000
You want a bite too?

02:57:55.000 --> 02:57:56.080
You most certainly can have a bite.

02:57:56.080 --> 02:57:57.640
Go, ah.

02:57:57.640 --> 02:57:59.360
Here comes the airplane.

02:58:04.960 --> 02:58:07.120
I've always done any itch, my eyelash.

02:58:07.120 --> 02:58:09.680
It's always on my left eye, my first eyelash.

02:58:15.760 --> 02:58:16.600
That's four.

02:58:18.400 --> 02:58:19.560
All the food is gone.

02:58:22.280 --> 02:58:24.640
We will now go back to the shoemaker

02:58:24.640 --> 02:58:28.920
because we need the shoemaker in order to progress.

02:58:28.920 --> 02:58:30.280
Oh, ow.

02:58:30.280 --> 02:58:32.160
My butt, I was looking at chat

02:58:32.160 --> 02:58:34.760
and that gammy sniped my butt.

02:58:37.720 --> 02:58:39.280
Delicious, delicious, delicious.

02:58:39.280 --> 02:58:40.680
Goodbye.

02:58:40.680 --> 02:58:41.520
No.

02:58:43.960 --> 02:58:46.920
Chewing the mic and you shall be forgiven.

02:58:46.920 --> 02:58:48.520
No, people hate that.

02:58:48.520 --> 02:58:52.120
It's like, there's something called like misophobia

02:58:52.120 --> 02:58:52.960
or something.

02:58:55.800 --> 02:58:57.360
Oh, here it is, this is the event.

02:58:57.360 --> 02:58:59.080
Okay, we're doing it, we're doing it.

02:59:03.160 --> 02:59:06.880
Oh, sleepy little, oh, yeah, I worked in too hard.

02:59:08.200 --> 02:59:09.360
There we go.

02:59:11.000 --> 02:59:12.240
Hello, hi.

02:59:13.600 --> 02:59:15.280
Hey, hey, you're Link, right?

02:59:15.280 --> 02:59:18.720
You're the one who brought the sword to Master Merlari.

02:59:18.720 --> 02:59:21.480
You're on a quest to help the princess, aren't you?

02:59:21.480 --> 02:59:22.760
I wish I could go on a quest,

02:59:22.760 --> 02:59:24.760
but then who'd make Rem's shoes for him?

02:59:24.760 --> 02:59:27.080
Notice how he's called Rem as in Rem's sleep.

02:59:29.000 --> 02:59:31.760
Like that one beach it better from.

02:59:31.840 --> 02:59:35.000
V4, Rem, yeah, Rem, get it.

02:59:36.280 --> 02:59:38.080
Hey ho, is that Pegasus boots?

02:59:38.080 --> 02:59:40.000
We just made a pair while Rem was sleeping,

02:59:40.000 --> 02:59:42.840
but only Rem can put the finishing touches on them.

02:59:42.840 --> 02:59:44.360
Ha ha, that sleepy head.

02:59:44.360 --> 02:59:45.960
Rem is nearly impossible to wake up.

02:59:45.960 --> 02:59:46.880
If you wanna wake him up,

02:59:46.880 --> 02:59:49.320
you'll need to get an item from Syrups Hop.

02:59:50.360 --> 02:59:52.080
It's a little bit of a trek,

02:59:52.080 --> 02:59:54.920
but we'll mark it on the map for you.

02:59:56.480 --> 03:00:00.840
So now we need to go up into the right.

03:00:01.880 --> 03:00:06.680
Um, oh, I feel freaking detailed all this is.

03:00:06.680 --> 03:00:08.160
Who is Rem?

03:00:08.160 --> 03:00:12.440
From the other VTuber agency for V-Reverie.

03:00:12.440 --> 03:00:14.280
I can, no, not reverie.

03:00:14.280 --> 03:00:15.880
Not reverie, hold on a minute.

03:00:15.880 --> 03:00:17.080
Not that one.

03:00:17.080 --> 03:00:20.200
It's like V4 Mariaeus.

03:00:20.200 --> 03:00:24.160
There, V4-Me-E-Ret-Ail.

03:00:24.160 --> 03:00:25.360
Look, I'm gonna be honest,

03:00:25.360 --> 03:00:27.160
I don't know how on earth to say it.

03:00:28.120 --> 03:00:30.360
You guys are gonna have to spell it out for me

03:00:30.360 --> 03:00:32.840
if you want me to say the name of that agency properly,

03:00:32.840 --> 03:00:34.680
cause I ain't got a chance.

03:00:34.680 --> 03:00:35.800
I ain't got a chance.

03:00:36.760 --> 03:00:37.600
Okay.

03:00:40.400 --> 03:00:42.600
My-Rae.

03:00:42.600 --> 03:00:44.640
My-Me-Rae?

03:00:45.560 --> 03:00:46.680
Mer-Rae.

03:00:50.240 --> 03:00:52.160
V4 Mer-Rae.

03:00:54.360 --> 03:00:56.440
It was supposed to be a V0 though.

03:00:57.440 --> 03:01:00.320
It said like, me-er-ae.

03:01:01.920 --> 03:01:02.960
Me-er-ae.

03:01:02.960 --> 03:01:04.520
Me-er-ae.

03:01:04.520 --> 03:01:05.840
Me-er-ae.

03:01:05.840 --> 03:01:06.680
Hello?

03:01:06.680 --> 03:01:07.520
Oh, what's wrong?

03:01:07.520 --> 03:01:09.400
You wanna fuse Kinstone?

03:01:09.400 --> 03:01:10.480
Sugar, I don't have it.

03:01:10.480 --> 03:01:12.000
Oh, you wanna quit too bad.

03:01:12.000 --> 03:01:13.840
Oh, just milked him.

03:01:13.840 --> 03:01:15.040
I'm so sorry, sir.

03:01:15.040 --> 03:01:17.160
Oh, I'm sorry, sir, sorry.

03:01:17.160 --> 03:01:19.120
I didn't mean anything by it.

03:01:19.120 --> 03:01:21.280
I lost my keys and I can't get inside.

03:01:23.600 --> 03:01:24.420
What pain?

03:01:24.420 --> 03:01:27.460
I think I'm going into town to serve Lon Lon milk.

03:01:27.460 --> 03:01:30.540
Oh, well, I can get in the whooshed nae-ball there, didn't you?

03:01:30.540 --> 03:01:31.740
Didn't you mind me?

03:01:32.980 --> 03:01:34.980
Girls are so cute when they're a little,

03:01:34.980 --> 03:01:36.500
when they're a little rere-ere.

03:01:37.820 --> 03:01:40.180
Okay, we need to find the key.

03:01:40.180 --> 03:01:41.540
Or just on the other door.

03:01:45.620 --> 03:01:46.460
Oh, there is.

03:01:48.940 --> 03:01:50.580
Okay, we got the key, so now we need to go back

03:01:50.580 --> 03:01:53.140
and be like, hey, we touched my goats' thumb, but...

03:01:55.300 --> 03:01:56.940
We totally found it.

03:01:56.940 --> 03:02:00.980
And it wasn't through any, not nefarious.

03:02:00.980 --> 03:02:03.820
We had didn't have malicious intent behind finding the key.

03:02:03.820 --> 03:02:06.940
Hey, sir, here's your key, all yours.

03:02:07.860 --> 03:02:09.860
Oh, our one and only spare key.

03:02:09.860 --> 03:02:11.220
I don't know how you got this,

03:02:11.220 --> 03:02:12.260
but I can't thank you enough.

03:02:12.260 --> 03:02:13.860
Tell me your name, Sunny Jim.

03:02:13.860 --> 03:02:15.500
Link, that's a great name.

03:02:15.500 --> 03:02:18.220
If you ever need to go to Lake Hyalil,

03:02:18.220 --> 03:02:19.700
feel free to cut through our house.

03:02:19.700 --> 03:02:22.420
Yes, that's exactly what we need to do.

03:02:22.420 --> 03:02:23.940
Thank you very much, Link.

03:02:24.860 --> 03:02:25.940
Shut up, little man.

03:02:25.940 --> 03:02:26.780
Hello?

03:02:27.780 --> 03:02:31.540
Come visit us again at any time, lady.

03:02:31.540 --> 03:02:33.820
I'm just a wee lad, are you?

03:02:33.820 --> 03:02:35.620
But if a lady invites you in our house,

03:02:35.620 --> 03:02:37.420
who am I to know a blight?

03:02:40.820 --> 03:02:42.220
Hello, cow.

03:02:42.220 --> 03:02:43.820
Yes, of course, this is me.

03:02:43.820 --> 03:02:46.820
Wait, I'm not getting any more Kinstone drops,

03:02:46.820 --> 03:02:49.220
so I think we're at the limit of orbit gains

03:02:49.220 --> 03:02:50.060
when we give those.

03:02:50.060 --> 03:02:52.580
Oh, I'll tell a lie, I'll tell a Feverruni.

03:02:53.940 --> 03:02:55.300
If she needs milk?

03:02:55.300 --> 03:02:56.820
No, she's the one with the milk.

03:02:56.820 --> 03:02:58.140
We're just a...

03:02:59.140 --> 03:03:01.420
How tranquil, and those cows look so delicious.

03:03:01.420 --> 03:03:05.340
No, we're not eating the cows.

03:03:05.340 --> 03:03:06.180
Here we go.

03:03:06.180 --> 03:03:07.420
We're not eating the cows.

03:03:07.420 --> 03:03:08.940
We're not eating the cows.

03:03:08.940 --> 03:03:10.340
We're not eating the cows.

03:03:10.340 --> 03:03:12.220
We're not eating the cows.

03:03:12.260 --> 03:03:13.660
How...

03:03:13.660 --> 03:03:14.420
How is it?

03:03:14.420 --> 03:03:15.260
Islo?

03:03:17.100 --> 03:03:20.260
If you can't see Mariah,

03:03:20.260 --> 03:03:23.740
can you see purple burglar out or did it?

03:03:23.740 --> 03:03:26.540
One day we'll get through a stream, one day.

03:03:26.540 --> 03:03:27.780
That stream is not today.

03:03:29.860 --> 03:03:32.420
Yes, I can see it, but if I put on a heavy accent,

03:03:32.420 --> 03:03:33.260
I can't see it.

03:03:35.460 --> 03:03:36.300
What is that for?

03:03:37.300 --> 03:03:43.300
Uh, there is a teleportation.

03:03:46.100 --> 03:03:47.100
Like, hiro.

03:03:48.180 --> 03:03:49.980
I'm so sorry, by the way,

03:03:49.980 --> 03:03:52.700
for the purple burglar alarm corne meant.

03:03:52.700 --> 03:03:55.620
I'm sorry if I sounded like so defeated.

03:03:55.620 --> 03:03:58.100
I'm not like upset or anything.

03:03:58.100 --> 03:03:59.500
It's just...

03:03:59.500 --> 03:04:02.100
You're not the only one who asks about such things.

03:04:02.100 --> 03:04:04.780
Wait, can I not get up there already?

03:04:04.780 --> 03:04:05.780
I think I can.

03:04:07.300 --> 03:04:09.380
Astrony is adorable.

03:04:09.380 --> 03:04:10.900
Astrony is adorable.

03:04:12.260 --> 03:04:13.620
Thank you.

03:04:13.620 --> 03:04:14.860
You know who else is adorable?

03:04:14.860 --> 03:04:16.180
You, please.

03:04:16.180 --> 03:04:17.020
Exactly.

03:04:21.940 --> 03:04:23.660
There's a heart.

03:04:23.660 --> 03:04:24.860
Oh, no, but we can't reach it.

03:04:24.860 --> 03:04:26.220
We need some to...

03:04:26.220 --> 03:04:27.380
Oh, we got a serious.

03:04:27.380 --> 03:04:29.100
We got a red one, though.

03:04:29.100 --> 03:04:31.100
Do we go in a tunnel and try and get up?

03:04:37.300 --> 03:04:42.820
Now, I am 99% sure there is an event,

03:04:42.820 --> 03:04:44.420
a tamed event that comes up,

03:04:44.420 --> 03:04:46.100
and I really don't want to screw it up.

03:04:46.100 --> 03:04:47.700
Wait, I'll just go straight down.

03:04:51.900 --> 03:04:55.420
And it's to trade that guy back in the one

03:04:55.420 --> 03:04:57.900
that I tried to explode his house by accident.

03:04:59.220 --> 03:05:00.820
So we might actually have to go back

03:05:00.820 --> 03:05:02.380
because it's a tamed event.

03:05:02.380 --> 03:05:04.300
And if you don't do it properly,

03:05:04.300 --> 03:05:05.820
well, you're done, so...

03:05:07.300 --> 03:05:09.300
Where am I going with this?

03:05:10.300 --> 03:05:12.300
There better be a secret down here.

03:05:15.300 --> 03:05:16.300
Oh, wow.

03:05:16.300 --> 03:05:17.300
But I hope this is the right way.

03:05:17.300 --> 03:05:19.300
I've just gone off the map.

03:05:21.300 --> 03:05:22.300
Lake Helio.

03:05:23.300 --> 03:05:24.300
Please see.

03:05:24.300 --> 03:05:26.300
It's like, this way to Mayor Hagan's

03:05:26.300 --> 03:05:27.300
Lake State Cabin.

03:05:28.300 --> 03:05:30.300
Have I gone the wrong way?

03:05:30.300 --> 03:05:31.300
Oh, my God.

03:05:31.300 --> 03:05:32.300
Oh, no.

03:05:32.300 --> 03:05:33.300
I'm just going to have to play the game

03:05:33.300 --> 03:05:34.300
even more with you.

03:05:34.300 --> 03:05:35.300
Let's see it.

03:05:40.300 --> 03:05:41.300
Okay, I have gone the wrong way.

03:05:41.300 --> 03:05:42.300
I'm pretty sure.

03:05:42.300 --> 03:05:43.300
No, that's not true.

03:05:43.300 --> 03:05:45.300
That's not going to stop me.

03:05:46.300 --> 03:05:47.300
Wait.

03:05:47.300 --> 03:05:50.300
No, well, I did go the right way by accident.

03:05:59.300 --> 03:06:01.300
Ah, welcome.

03:06:01.300 --> 03:06:06.300
Care for some of Granny's homemade blue potion.

03:06:06.300 --> 03:06:08.300
One sip and you're full of energy.

03:06:08.300 --> 03:06:10.300
Please look around.

03:06:10.300 --> 03:06:12.300
I need this mushroom, please.

03:06:13.300 --> 03:06:16.300
Oh, yes, a fine choice, my dear.

03:06:16.300 --> 03:06:18.300
That is a limited time article.

03:06:18.300 --> 03:06:20.300
One worth and you're wide awake.

03:06:20.300 --> 03:06:23.300
That is why it is called a wake-up mushroom.

03:06:23.300 --> 03:06:25.300
Would you like to buy it for 60 rupees?

03:06:25.300 --> 03:06:26.300
That's for you.

03:06:27.300 --> 03:06:28.300
You got a wake-up mushroom.

03:06:28.300 --> 03:06:29.300
It's a nasty stench.

03:06:29.300 --> 03:06:31.300
She chases away the sleepyhead.

03:06:31.300 --> 03:06:33.300
Just face the sleepyhead through that

03:06:33.300 --> 03:06:35.300
and press the button and he'll...

03:06:35.300 --> 03:06:37.300
and the little eyes will pop right open

03:06:37.300 --> 03:06:38.300
right out of the skull, yeah.

03:06:38.300 --> 03:06:39.300
Thanks, Granny.

03:06:39.300 --> 03:06:41.300
Please don't ever interact with me again.

03:06:41.300 --> 03:06:42.300
You're terrifying.

03:06:43.300 --> 03:06:45.300
Okay, if we're going back to town,

03:06:45.300 --> 03:06:46.300
I'll try and do that.

03:06:48.300 --> 03:06:50.300
But I don't want to miss out on the timed event.

03:06:50.300 --> 03:06:51.300
Okay.

03:06:51.300 --> 03:06:52.300
If you don't do it,

03:06:52.300 --> 03:06:54.300
a gentleman actually perishes

03:06:54.300 --> 03:06:55.300
and that's true.

03:06:55.300 --> 03:06:57.300
Would you drink my blue juice?

03:06:59.300 --> 03:07:00.300
You would.

03:07:00.300 --> 03:07:01.300
Admit it.

03:07:01.300 --> 03:07:02.300
I know you would.

03:07:02.300 --> 03:07:03.300
No, you don't even have to admit it

03:07:03.300 --> 03:07:04.300
because I know you just...

03:07:04.300 --> 03:07:05.300
Sorry, I said that.

03:07:07.300 --> 03:07:08.300
Whoa!

03:07:10.300 --> 03:07:11.300
Whoa!

03:07:11.300 --> 03:07:12.300
What are you doing here?

03:07:12.300 --> 03:07:14.300
We got another heartbeat by accident.

03:07:14.300 --> 03:07:15.300
I forgot.

03:07:16.300 --> 03:07:18.300
See, exploring pays off

03:07:18.300 --> 03:07:20.300
when you play legends of Zelda games

03:07:20.300 --> 03:07:22.300
like they're soon forgiven.

03:07:23.300 --> 03:07:25.300
Lon Lon Ranch.

03:07:26.300 --> 03:07:28.300
I really need a fart right now.

03:07:29.300 --> 03:07:31.300
I don't know, I shouldn't...

03:07:32.300 --> 03:07:34.300
But I'm going to hold in.

03:07:36.300 --> 03:07:38.300
I assume this is where I was supposed to go.

03:07:38.300 --> 03:07:40.300
No, I was supposed to go up!

03:07:40.300 --> 03:07:41.300
No!

03:07:41.300 --> 03:07:42.300
No!

03:07:42.300 --> 03:07:44.300
How did I get back up there again?

03:07:44.300 --> 03:07:45.300
Ow!

03:07:46.300 --> 03:07:47.300
Let's do that.

03:07:48.300 --> 03:07:49.300
Just me a...

03:07:50.300 --> 03:07:51.300
Let it rip.

03:07:51.300 --> 03:07:52.300
Very question.

03:07:52.300 --> 03:07:54.300
Would you drink the 20s Aimee?

03:07:55.300 --> 03:07:56.300
Um...

03:07:56.300 --> 03:07:58.300
I don't know how easily I can master this.

03:07:58.300 --> 03:07:59.300
I'll be honest.

03:07:59.300 --> 03:08:01.300
What are you guys?

03:08:01.300 --> 03:08:02.300
Hello!

03:08:03.300 --> 03:08:04.300
You don't look aggressive,

03:08:04.300 --> 03:08:06.300
but I don't feel like you're angry.

03:08:06.300 --> 03:08:07.300
You're not.

03:08:07.300 --> 03:08:08.300
You wanna fuse?

03:08:08.300 --> 03:08:09.300
Sure!

03:08:09.300 --> 03:08:10.300
Hey, go buddy!

03:08:11.300 --> 03:08:12.300
What does it do?

03:08:12.300 --> 03:08:13.300
It's a Goron!

03:08:13.300 --> 03:08:15.300
His name is Goron.

03:08:18.300 --> 03:08:19.300
Eh?

03:08:23.300 --> 03:08:24.300
Oh!

03:08:24.300 --> 03:08:25.300
No!

03:08:28.300 --> 03:08:30.300
It's been a long time since the last time

03:08:30.300 --> 03:08:31.300
I visited Hyrule.

03:08:31.300 --> 03:08:33.300
I think I'll stay at this place

03:08:33.300 --> 03:08:35.300
and I can sell my Kinstone.

03:08:35.300 --> 03:08:36.300
Yes!

03:08:36.300 --> 03:08:37.300
This is exactly what we need.

03:08:37.300 --> 03:08:39.300
We need to throw our money into him.

03:08:42.300 --> 03:08:43.300
Wow, hydration check.

03:08:43.300 --> 03:08:45.300
I need to start slipping my tear.

03:08:45.300 --> 03:08:46.300
It's gonna get cold.

03:08:48.300 --> 03:08:50.300
Hmm, they fit perfectly.

03:08:50.300 --> 03:08:51.300
That's so good.

03:08:51.300 --> 03:08:52.300
Are you okay?

03:08:52.300 --> 03:08:53.300
This is one solid wall.

03:08:53.300 --> 03:08:55.300
I need a few friends to give me a hand.

03:08:55.300 --> 03:08:57.300
I will get you those friends soon, TM.

03:08:57.300 --> 03:08:58.300
But not yet,

03:08:58.300 --> 03:09:00.300
because I need to do other things.

03:09:00.300 --> 03:09:01.300
Hold on.

03:09:01.300 --> 03:09:04.300
Let me just cut down your produce for you.

03:09:04.300 --> 03:09:05.300
Hello!

03:09:05.300 --> 03:09:06.300
Oh!

03:09:07.300 --> 03:09:08.300
Riplings!

03:09:08.300 --> 03:09:09.300
They're farmed!

03:09:09.300 --> 03:09:10.300
There's no one here,

03:09:10.300 --> 03:09:11.300
so it's ours!

03:09:11.300 --> 03:09:12.300
Oh!

03:09:13.300 --> 03:09:14.300
Cosmo.

03:09:14.300 --> 03:09:15.300
I love working in the garden.

03:09:15.300 --> 03:09:16.300
It makes me feel so close to nature

03:09:16.300 --> 03:09:18.300
and sometimes I dig off a Kinstone.

03:09:18.300 --> 03:09:19.300
Right, okay.

03:09:19.300 --> 03:09:20.300
We know what we're doing.

03:09:21.300 --> 03:09:22.300
Hee hee hee.

03:09:24.300 --> 03:09:25.300
Please, CJ.

03:09:25.300 --> 03:09:26.300
I'm drink tea.

03:09:26.300 --> 03:09:27.300
I drink tea.

03:09:29.300 --> 03:09:30.300
Oh my god,

03:09:30.300 --> 03:09:31.300
we already helped them out.

03:09:34.300 --> 03:09:36.300
I feel so much stronger now.

03:09:36.300 --> 03:09:37.300
Here we go.

03:09:42.300 --> 03:09:44.300
Sorry, I'm drinking my tea.

03:09:44.300 --> 03:09:45.300
It's about time.

03:09:45.300 --> 03:09:46.300
Looking good, though.

03:09:46.300 --> 03:09:47.300
I'm going in.

03:09:48.300 --> 03:09:50.300
That's what Ripling said.

03:09:55.300 --> 03:09:56.300
Look at that.

03:09:56.300 --> 03:09:57.300
A perfect fit.

03:09:57.300 --> 03:09:58.300
Okay, what about you?

03:09:58.300 --> 03:09:59.300
Do you have one?

03:09:59.300 --> 03:10:00.300
You do!

03:10:01.300 --> 03:10:03.300
One a few Kinstone pieces?

03:10:03.300 --> 03:10:04.300
Let's rock and roll.

03:10:05.300 --> 03:10:06.300
Yes, please.

03:10:06.300 --> 03:10:07.300
Oh, hold on.

03:10:08.300 --> 03:10:09.300
Wait!

03:10:09.300 --> 03:10:10.300
What?

03:10:10.300 --> 03:10:11.300
I did it!

03:10:11.300 --> 03:10:12.300
I did it!

03:10:12.300 --> 03:10:13.300
Sorry, sorry.

03:10:13.300 --> 03:10:14.300
I'm trying to play one-handed.

03:10:15.300 --> 03:10:16.300
It's not that kind of game.

03:10:16.300 --> 03:10:17.300
That comes later.

03:10:17.300 --> 03:10:18.300
Okay, that comes in July.

03:10:25.300 --> 03:10:26.300
I do remember seeing that.

03:10:27.300 --> 03:10:28.300
The wall.

03:10:28.300 --> 03:10:30.300
Okay, we're not going to go back to the wall.

03:10:33.300 --> 03:10:35.300
That is very far away.

03:10:35.300 --> 03:10:37.300
Look, I'm helping you tail the soil.

03:10:38.300 --> 03:10:39.300
Oh, there's a sneaky poo.

03:10:40.300 --> 03:10:42.300
We will hurt the sneaky poo.

03:10:43.300 --> 03:10:45.300
But I want to talk to the guy first.

03:10:45.300 --> 03:10:46.300
Hello.

03:10:47.300 --> 03:10:49.300
Hello, I'm at a client.

03:10:50.300 --> 03:10:52.300
Oh, no, you need a new buddy.

03:10:52.300 --> 03:10:53.300
This is a solid wall.

03:10:53.300 --> 03:10:54.300
I'm going to need a friend.

03:10:54.300 --> 03:10:55.300
Okay, okay, okay.

03:10:55.300 --> 03:10:57.300
We need to just keep doing the Kinstone

03:10:57.300 --> 03:10:59.300
to unlock more events.

03:11:01.300 --> 03:11:04.300
And I just realized we unlocked something back here.

03:11:08.300 --> 03:11:11.300
We will go and get it right now.

03:11:11.300 --> 03:11:13.300
Wait, what's over here?

03:11:17.300 --> 03:11:19.300
Veil falls.

03:11:19.300 --> 03:11:20.300
I don't...

03:11:20.300 --> 03:11:22.300
No, we're not to be here yet.

03:11:22.300 --> 03:11:23.300
Rit.

03:11:23.300 --> 03:11:24.300
I saw that.

03:11:26.300 --> 03:11:27.300
Spelunking.

03:11:27.300 --> 03:11:28.300
No, I can't run.

03:11:28.300 --> 03:11:30.300
I want to escape the word spelunk.

03:11:31.300 --> 03:11:32.300
And he fell.

03:11:32.300 --> 03:11:33.300
Spelunk.

03:11:33.300 --> 03:11:34.300
Wah.

03:11:34.300 --> 03:11:35.300
Okay, hold on.

03:11:35.300 --> 03:11:38.300
Is the games being kind and giving me them again?

03:11:41.300 --> 03:11:42.300
What's it?

03:11:43.300 --> 03:11:45.300
I'm a fellow spunker, I have to admit.

03:11:46.300 --> 03:11:47.300
Spunks all over you.

03:11:50.300 --> 03:11:53.300
They're top left one, I think we unlocked.

03:11:53.300 --> 03:11:54.300
Sorry, I keep taking damage

03:11:54.300 --> 03:11:56.300
because I'm like hardly paying attention.

03:11:56.300 --> 03:11:58.300
But not in a bad way, just like...

03:11:59.300 --> 03:12:00.300
Mm-hmm.

03:12:02.300 --> 03:12:03.300
Okay, okay, okay.

03:12:03.300 --> 03:12:05.300
There's something in that chair.

03:12:06.300 --> 03:12:08.300
Oh, red, that's perfect.

03:12:11.300 --> 03:12:12.300
Mm-hmm.

03:12:17.300 --> 03:12:20.300
No, no, spelunking means cave exploring.

03:12:20.300 --> 03:12:22.300
That's what we're talking about.

03:12:23.300 --> 03:12:27.300
Right, can I finally trade the freaking guy?

03:12:27.300 --> 03:12:29.300
Oh, we need to do this.

03:12:30.300 --> 03:12:33.300
Wait, it does disappear and he gets a fright every time.

03:12:33.300 --> 03:12:34.300
We get it.

03:12:34.300 --> 03:12:35.300
It's the same dialogue.

03:12:35.300 --> 03:12:36.300
The dialogue hasn't changed.

03:12:36.300 --> 03:12:39.300
Oh, she's selling her milkies.

03:12:39.300 --> 03:12:42.300
I'm selling creamy nutritious llama milk.

03:12:42.300 --> 03:12:43.300
It's Azura.

03:12:43.300 --> 03:12:45.300
Don't buy, sorry, I'm not that rich.

03:12:45.300 --> 03:12:46.300
I'm a child.

03:12:46.300 --> 03:12:47.300
Do you want a fuse?

03:12:47.300 --> 03:12:48.300
Yes, please.

03:12:48.300 --> 03:12:51.300
I don't have the freaking one you seek.

03:12:52.300 --> 03:12:53.300
What about you?

03:12:54.300 --> 03:12:55.300
Yes, I do have what you seek.

03:12:55.300 --> 03:12:57.300
Finally, one that I have.

03:13:03.300 --> 03:13:05.300
Oh, this is at the castle.

03:13:10.300 --> 03:13:11.300
Goat milk, yeah.

03:13:11.300 --> 03:13:13.300
I remember when I teased Azura,

03:13:13.300 --> 03:13:15.300
everyone was like, a cowgirl?

03:13:15.300 --> 03:13:17.300
I'm like, no, that's far too obvious.

03:13:17.300 --> 03:13:19.300
What other thing produces milk?

03:13:21.300 --> 03:13:22.300
Goat.

03:13:22.300 --> 03:13:23.300
Um...

03:13:24.300 --> 03:13:26.300
I thought it was clever anyway.

03:13:26.300 --> 03:13:27.300
I thought it was good.

03:13:28.300 --> 03:13:30.300
This one, yes, I want to fuse.

03:13:30.300 --> 03:13:32.300
This is the time-gated one,

03:13:32.300 --> 03:13:34.300
so we're going to do this right now,

03:13:34.300 --> 03:13:37.300
so no one passes away due to my foolishness, okay?

03:13:40.300 --> 03:13:41.300
Mm.

03:13:41.300 --> 03:13:43.300
So this is right above our house,

03:13:43.300 --> 03:13:45.300
we're going to go back to our house really quickly.

03:13:45.300 --> 03:13:47.300
Goth boy, cleat at the castle.

03:13:48.300 --> 03:13:50.300
Fusing stones with Malon.

03:13:51.300 --> 03:13:52.300
Mm.

03:13:52.300 --> 03:13:54.300
Wait, is she actually called Malon?

03:13:56.300 --> 03:13:59.300
Is that supposed to be because of her melons?

03:13:59.300 --> 03:14:00.300
How's your name, Malon?

03:14:03.300 --> 03:14:05.300
Yeah, you can tell her names.

03:14:06.300 --> 03:14:08.300
You know, I don't think I've ever tried goat milk before.

03:14:09.300 --> 03:14:12.300
If Azura didn't have an upset tummy,

03:14:12.300 --> 03:14:14.300
I think it would be adorable

03:14:14.300 --> 03:14:18.300
to get her to try all the different milk.

03:14:19.300 --> 03:14:21.300
But unfortunately, Azura has an upset tummy.

03:14:24.300 --> 03:14:27.300
Okay, are you ready?

03:14:28.300 --> 03:14:32.300
You have to do this, or else you perish on a fire,

03:14:32.300 --> 03:14:35.300
and this poor gentleman passes away.

03:14:36.300 --> 03:14:37.300
So, hi.

03:14:37.300 --> 03:14:39.300
Goodness, we rarely get visitors.

03:14:39.300 --> 03:14:42.300
Tell me, how did you get here via teleportation?

03:14:44.300 --> 03:14:45.300
Are you okay?

03:14:45.300 --> 03:14:48.300
Nobody believes me, but I saw a ghost that's taken over Granda.

03:14:48.300 --> 03:14:49.300
Yes.

03:14:49.300 --> 03:14:52.300
If you do not suck away the ghost,

03:14:52.300 --> 03:14:54.300
he literally passes away.

03:14:54.300 --> 03:14:57.300
I can't believe old Greggal is sick.

03:14:57.300 --> 03:14:58.300
He was looking so healthy,

03:14:58.300 --> 03:15:00.300
I guess something just took a hold of him.

03:15:01.300 --> 03:15:04.300
Literally, if you do not do this.

03:15:07.300 --> 03:15:09.300
Okay, now that thing's strong.

03:15:11.300 --> 03:15:14.300
Well, well, well, look at how the colours come back to his face.

03:15:14.300 --> 03:15:16.300
How can I ever thank you?

03:15:16.300 --> 03:15:19.300
I still have a hard time believing he'd been possessed by a monster, though.

03:15:19.300 --> 03:15:21.300
Well, I don't find it hard at all.

03:15:21.300 --> 03:15:23.300
What, an evil spirit had taken a hold of me?

03:15:23.300 --> 03:15:25.300
And you drove it away?

03:15:25.300 --> 03:15:26.300
You might be right.

03:15:26.300 --> 03:15:28.300
I already feel my energy returning.

03:15:28.300 --> 03:15:30.300
I'll be able to get out of bed soon.

03:15:30.300 --> 03:15:31.300
What's your name?

03:15:31.300 --> 03:15:32.300
Link.

03:15:32.300 --> 03:15:33.300
Thank you, my boy.

03:15:33.300 --> 03:15:34.300
You saved me.

03:15:34.300 --> 03:15:35.300
I'm a hundred shell.

03:15:35.300 --> 03:15:37.300
If you do not do that,

03:15:37.300 --> 03:15:40.300
before you unlock this area,

03:15:40.300 --> 03:15:43.300
the non-teleportation way,

03:15:43.300 --> 03:15:45.300
he is no longer in the game.

03:15:46.300 --> 03:15:50.300
And you literally cause him to perish if you do not do that.

03:15:51.300 --> 03:15:54.300
Now, all is good and we can go back to the main quest.

03:15:55.300 --> 03:15:56.300
80% forehead.

03:15:56.300 --> 03:15:58.300
But he's just an elder and he's smart.

03:15:58.300 --> 03:16:00.300
Okay, where's he going to put all the knowledge and wisdom?

03:16:02.300 --> 03:16:03.300
Exactly.

03:16:03.300 --> 03:16:05.300
So you didn't think that far ahead, did you?

03:16:06.300 --> 03:16:08.300
Oh, I forgot to do the wee bird.

03:16:09.300 --> 03:16:10.300
Hello.

03:16:10.300 --> 03:16:11.300
Are you going to teach me something?

03:16:11.300 --> 03:16:12.300
A new sword.

03:16:12.300 --> 03:16:13.300
Fantastic.

03:16:13.300 --> 03:16:15.300
And you seem to have acquired new skills with it.

03:16:15.300 --> 03:16:17.300
I'm going to train you again, young swordsman.

03:16:17.300 --> 03:16:18.300
Will you accept?

03:16:18.300 --> 03:16:20.300
Yes, we will.

03:16:20.300 --> 03:16:23.300
I will now teach you a technique called the rock breaker.

03:16:23.300 --> 03:16:24.300
So pay attention.

03:16:24.300 --> 03:16:27.300
First, swing your sword to break pots.

03:16:27.300 --> 03:16:30.300
Actually, that's all there is to it, young swordsman.

03:16:30.300 --> 03:16:31.300
Do you understand?

03:16:31.300 --> 03:16:32.300
Yes.

03:16:33.300 --> 03:16:34.300
Yes, good.

03:16:34.300 --> 03:16:39.300
If you had said you didn't understand, I would have serious doubts about you.

03:16:39.300 --> 03:16:41.300
Yes, you must feel the technique.

03:16:41.300 --> 03:16:45.300
But one must feel the technique, not just hear about it.

03:16:45.300 --> 03:16:49.300
That's why I will now possess your body and do as to demonstrate the technique.

03:16:49.300 --> 03:16:54.300
That is the secret of the swift blade possession technique of training.

03:16:54.300 --> 03:16:55.300
Watch this.

03:16:58.300 --> 03:16:59.300
Position.

03:17:04.300 --> 03:17:05.300
Poof.

03:17:05.300 --> 03:17:07.300
Now you must try it for yourself.

03:17:07.300 --> 03:17:09.300
Break the pots with your sword.

03:17:09.300 --> 03:17:10.300
That's all.

03:17:11.300 --> 03:17:12.300
Yes, fine work.

03:17:12.300 --> 03:17:13.300
Fantastic even.

03:17:13.300 --> 03:17:15.300
I now give you the tiger scroll.

03:17:15.300 --> 03:17:18.300
If you ever forget the technique, you can read it in the scroll.

03:17:18.300 --> 03:17:20.300
Rock breaker fighting technique.

03:17:20.300 --> 03:17:24.300
Shatter pots and pulverize boulders with a single blow.

03:17:25.300 --> 03:17:27.300
Is there anything else I can do?

03:17:29.300 --> 03:17:32.300
Come again when you learn to run like the wind.

03:17:32.300 --> 03:17:33.300
Hmm.

03:17:33.300 --> 03:17:34.300
I suppose.

03:17:34.300 --> 03:17:36.300
Wait, how did I get to that chickadee?

03:17:40.300 --> 03:17:41.300
I don't know.

03:17:41.300 --> 03:17:44.300
I actually don't know how to get into the shuffle though.

03:17:45.300 --> 03:17:48.300
There's a singing thing.

03:17:48.300 --> 03:17:50.300
I don't know what that's about.

03:17:51.300 --> 03:17:56.300
I want to do this, but I don't think we're there yet.

03:17:57.300 --> 03:17:58.300
Hello.

03:17:58.300 --> 03:18:00.300
Bring whatever piece you'd like to shape.

03:18:00.300 --> 03:18:02.300
You're like a simple amount of personal taste.

03:18:02.300 --> 03:18:03.300
Goodle.

03:18:03.300 --> 03:18:05.300
Oh, he wants to do it again.

03:18:06.300 --> 03:18:07.300
Get again again.

03:18:08.300 --> 03:18:10.300
Okay, I'll see, I'll see.

03:18:16.300 --> 03:18:18.300
Oh, unlock something in the room.

03:18:21.300 --> 03:18:22.300
Hi, Jason, hi, Jason.

03:18:23.300 --> 03:18:24.300
They fit perfectly.

03:18:24.300 --> 03:18:27.300
Oh, I expect my sales will be tripled by this.

03:18:29.300 --> 03:18:33.300
So did they, did they just go in order or what, they need it?

03:18:36.300 --> 03:18:38.300
Oh, that's up north.

03:18:40.300 --> 03:18:42.300
There might be life inside of that.

03:18:42.300 --> 03:18:46.300
I think we'll go do that like right now because I think there's going to be an extra life in there.

03:18:46.300 --> 03:18:48.300
Like a heart container, pardon me.

03:18:49.300 --> 03:18:52.300
I know, I'm sorry for people who want me to just do the main quest,

03:18:52.300 --> 03:18:54.300
but that's the fun thing about the Zelda game,

03:18:54.300 --> 03:18:56.300
is you get to do all this fun side stuff.

03:19:02.300 --> 03:19:03.300
Oh, it's a fairy.

03:19:03.300 --> 03:19:04.300
Sure.

03:19:05.300 --> 03:19:09.300
You found a fairy, a reliable ally to cleanse your health.

03:19:09.300 --> 03:19:11.300
If you trap a fairy in a jar.

03:19:14.300 --> 03:19:16.300
Not like that, Riflin.

03:19:16.300 --> 03:19:19.300
Um, this wing friend will come to your aid.

03:19:19.300 --> 03:19:22.300
Don't put the fairy in the jar for other reasons.

03:19:22.300 --> 03:19:24.300
Do I make myself clear, Riflings?

03:19:25.300 --> 03:19:26.300
Good.

03:19:28.300 --> 03:19:29.300
The fairies are so cute in this game.

03:19:29.300 --> 03:19:32.300
Yes, this is a very cute pixel game.

03:19:33.300 --> 03:19:36.300
Is there, so can I just keep like Kinstone into the same,

03:19:36.300 --> 03:19:38.300
I can, just over and over again.

03:19:38.300 --> 03:19:40.300
I guess it mustn't really matter.

03:19:42.300 --> 03:19:43.300
Oh no, I can't do you.

03:19:44.300 --> 03:19:46.300
Is there anything here in here?

03:19:48.300 --> 03:19:49.300
A boomerang?

03:19:51.300 --> 03:19:53.300
Hello, how much is this?

03:19:53.300 --> 03:19:54.300
300!

03:19:56.300 --> 03:19:58.300
Oh, he's got a jar behind him.

03:19:58.300 --> 03:20:00.300
Wait, how did I get here?

03:20:02.300 --> 03:20:04.300
He's got a jar, I need two jars.

03:20:06.300 --> 03:20:08.300
Ah, sugar, I can't do it yet.

03:20:08.300 --> 03:20:10.300
I must be after this one.

03:20:11.300 --> 03:20:15.300
You're going to need a lot more zinc tomatoes and pineapples.

03:20:18.300 --> 03:20:20.300
Remember to have tomatoes.

03:20:20.300 --> 03:20:26.300
This is good for you and your, your twins question mark.

03:20:26.300 --> 03:20:28.300
Can I choose you because you're so cute.

03:20:28.300 --> 03:20:30.300
You're so adorable.

03:20:31.300 --> 03:20:33.300
What do you unlock, little trick-a-dee?

03:20:34.300 --> 03:20:38.300
The other fountain in the, the...

03:20:38.300 --> 03:20:40.300
Castello.

03:20:42.300 --> 03:20:45.300
You can push it, you've got to be big.

03:20:45.300 --> 03:20:48.300
No, I need a ring, it's like a special ring.

03:20:48.300 --> 03:20:52.300
Bye-bye, I'm going to finish, I'm not like my brother so I'm going to look at it.

03:20:52.300 --> 03:20:54.300
Okay, thank you.

03:20:55.300 --> 03:20:57.300
Thank you very much.

03:20:58.300 --> 03:21:00.300
Thank you very much.

03:21:03.300 --> 03:21:05.300
Uh...

03:21:07.300 --> 03:21:11.300
That's what it is, I need the library to open up and put me on the book quest,

03:21:11.300 --> 03:21:14.300
but that's not yet, it's after the swamp break.

03:21:14.300 --> 03:21:18.300
We'll go pick up our shoes because I have been dilly-dallying enough.

03:21:21.300 --> 03:21:22.300
Wakey-wakey.

03:21:22.300 --> 03:21:25.300
If I recall correctly, and I guarantee that I do, my boy,

03:21:25.300 --> 03:21:30.300
I think syrup said to stand in front of the sleeping person and press the right bumper.

03:21:33.300 --> 03:21:35.300
It was literally just the interactive key.

03:21:37.300 --> 03:21:40.300
What is that terrifyingly bad smell?

03:21:40.300 --> 03:21:41.300
It's just me, sorry mate.

03:21:41.300 --> 03:21:44.300
I wake up mushroom, I should have guessed, so you woke me up.

03:21:44.300 --> 03:21:47.300
Thanks, I just remembered I have something urgent I need to do.

03:21:48.300 --> 03:21:50.300
Oh, what now?

03:21:50.300 --> 03:21:53.300
There are more new shoes, you probably won't believe this,

03:21:53.300 --> 03:21:57.300
but I have a strange habit of making shoes in my sleep.

03:21:57.300 --> 03:22:01.300
So you must have come here because you want some of my shoes, right? Tell me.

03:22:01.300 --> 03:22:04.300
What, because you're so nice enough to wake me up, you can have them,

03:22:04.300 --> 03:22:07.300
hold on a second though, I just need the finishing touches.

03:22:12.300 --> 03:22:14.300
And there we go, here, take these.

03:22:14.300 --> 03:22:16.300
These are my special Pegasus boots.

03:22:16.300 --> 03:22:20.300
They're so light, you'll feel like you're practically walking on air.

03:22:20.300 --> 03:22:25.300
You got the Pegasus boots, hold the button to run faster than the wind.

03:22:25.300 --> 03:22:28.300
Oh, I need to hurry up and get working on that special order,

03:22:28.300 --> 03:22:31.300
the king asked me to make some shoes for Princess Del D.C.

03:22:31.300 --> 03:22:33.300
Thanks for waking me up, come back if you ever need help,

03:22:33.300 --> 03:22:35.300
or if you have any shoe problems.

03:22:35.300 --> 03:22:38.300
Now we don't actually have any shoe problems.

03:22:38.300 --> 03:22:41.300
But we're gonna go back to the swordsman,

03:22:42.300 --> 03:22:45.300
because he will know teachers and new moves.

03:22:45.300 --> 03:22:47.300
Got them Jordans on.

03:22:48.300 --> 03:22:50.300
Ah yes, you have the Pegasus boots,

03:22:50.300 --> 03:22:52.300
and you seem to have more skill too.

03:22:52.300 --> 03:22:56.300
Yes, I am ready to train you again.

03:22:57.300 --> 03:22:59.300
I got almost just one minute there, huh?

03:22:59.300 --> 03:23:02.300
You will now learn a new technique called the dash attack.

03:23:02.300 --> 03:23:05.300
First, equip the Pegasus boots, equip your sword,

03:23:05.300 --> 03:23:08.300
third, run like crazy, that's all you need, do you understand?

03:23:08.300 --> 03:23:09.300
Yes.

03:23:09.300 --> 03:23:12.300
Yes, yes, you are my finest student.

03:23:12.300 --> 03:23:14.300
Just equip the sword and the Pegasus boots,

03:23:14.300 --> 03:23:17.300
and any button you like, but one must feel the technique,

03:23:17.300 --> 03:23:19.300
not just feel about it,

03:23:19.300 --> 03:23:22.300
that's why I will now possess your body to demonstrate it.

03:23:22.300 --> 03:23:24.300
Watch this!

03:23:24.300 --> 03:23:26.300
Position!

03:23:28.300 --> 03:23:29.300
Bonk!

03:23:30.300 --> 03:23:35.300
So now we can dash like crazy while having it out in front of us.

03:23:35.300 --> 03:23:37.300
We don't have to do anything else.

03:23:37.300 --> 03:23:40.300
Yes, fine work, you now take this tiger stroll.

03:23:40.300 --> 03:23:43.300
If you ever forget, just reach the stroll.

03:23:43.300 --> 03:23:44.300
We now know dash attack.

03:23:44.300 --> 03:23:46.300
Run like the wind and attack.

03:23:46.300 --> 03:23:50.300
Do you have anything more for me, or am I coming back?

03:23:50.300 --> 03:23:53.300
Come again when you can jump further.

03:23:54.300 --> 03:23:57.300
Got them jays on my feet.

03:23:59.300 --> 03:24:03.300
I'm sure there was something we could do.

03:24:03.300 --> 03:24:05.300
But I forgot.

03:24:07.300 --> 03:24:10.300
Out my way, out my way, ya bam.

03:24:10.300 --> 03:24:14.300
Wasn't there a special fairy tree over here?

03:24:14.300 --> 03:24:15.300
No?

03:24:15.300 --> 03:24:18.300
Yes, I knew there was!

03:24:18.300 --> 03:24:21.300
Whenever you see a tree sparkle, do that.

03:24:22.300 --> 03:24:27.300
And then become tiny, and then we can go explore.

03:24:27.300 --> 03:24:30.300
We're just so good at exploring.

03:24:30.300 --> 03:24:33.300
Garfunkel, thank you for coming a member.

03:24:33.300 --> 03:24:35.300
You moved the rock for me, great.

03:24:35.300 --> 03:24:37.300
I thought I'd never get outside.

03:24:37.300 --> 03:24:39.300
Aw, poor little guy, we're stuck.

03:24:39.300 --> 03:24:41.300
Look at his wee decorations.

03:24:41.300 --> 03:24:43.300
Got wee knick knacks over here,

03:24:43.300 --> 03:24:45.300
his wee cutlery set,

03:24:45.300 --> 03:24:47.300
all alone in my room.

03:24:47.300 --> 03:24:48.300
I love what you've done with the place,

03:24:48.300 --> 03:24:50.300
with a little rope on the wall.

03:24:50.300 --> 03:24:52.300
What you're into is fine.

03:24:52.300 --> 03:24:54.300
A little leaf like this stuff.

03:24:54.300 --> 03:24:56.300
I just want to play a cute little pixel game like this,

03:24:56.300 --> 03:24:59.300
and I don't know, maybe it's like making the townspeople happy.

03:24:59.300 --> 03:25:02.300
You know what, I'm just going to straight up develop it.

03:25:02.300 --> 03:25:06.300
I think I've said, um, not a,

03:25:06.300 --> 03:25:11.300
kind of after a reveal or, um,

03:25:11.300 --> 03:25:14.300
maybe going into fucking games.

03:25:14.300 --> 03:25:17.300
It's a game published in, where like, I pay a studio

03:25:17.300 --> 03:25:19.300
and make my game.

03:25:19.300 --> 03:25:21.300
Maybe doing that, basically.

03:25:21.300 --> 03:25:24.300
Um, but I'm happy to show the behind the scenes.

03:25:24.300 --> 03:25:26.300
I mean, fuck me, I can never be quiet

03:25:26.300 --> 03:25:28.300
whenever I've got a project going.

03:25:28.300 --> 03:25:29.300
I'm like, and this is what I'm doing right now,

03:25:29.300 --> 03:25:30.300
this is how I'm doing it, right?

03:25:30.300 --> 03:25:32.300
You guys do this, this is how I do it.

03:25:32.300 --> 03:25:34.300
Um, literally, I can't even keep my gob shot

03:25:34.300 --> 03:25:37.300
when I've got something going for me.

03:25:37.300 --> 03:25:40.300
Um, I'll just see how it goes.

03:25:40.300 --> 03:25:42.300
I do have an idea.

03:25:42.300 --> 03:25:44.300
I want to work with a studio,

03:25:44.300 --> 03:25:46.300
but the problem is that you need to get, like,

03:25:46.300 --> 03:25:48.300
fucking lawyers involved and everything.

03:25:48.300 --> 03:25:50.300
I had to, I felt so bad.

03:25:50.300 --> 03:25:52.300
So the VLR game, I feel really bad.

03:25:52.300 --> 03:25:57.300
I had to get a fucking lawyer's piece of shit contract

03:25:57.300 --> 03:25:59.300
because of the game.

03:25:59.300 --> 03:26:03.300
Like, because obviously I had to pay for it to be produced.

03:26:03.300 --> 03:26:05.300
It's not out yet for anyone that's like,

03:26:05.300 --> 03:26:06.300
huh, how are you talking about the game?

03:26:06.300 --> 03:26:08.300
I'm not playing the game from VLR.

03:26:08.300 --> 03:26:10.300
It's not out yet, it's not out yet.

03:26:10.300 --> 03:26:12.300
It's been developed, we're in the last stages.

03:26:12.300 --> 03:26:16.300
We're just waiting for the animation of the art to come through.

03:26:16.300 --> 03:26:19.300
Um, which is taking a bit more of a,

03:26:19.300 --> 03:26:22.300
um, it takes longer for that kind of side of production.

03:26:22.300 --> 03:26:24.300
Um, but I've got a good deal.

03:26:24.300 --> 03:26:26.300
Thanks to the developer I'm working with

03:26:26.300 --> 03:26:29.300
because, uh, I cannot go that way.

03:26:29.300 --> 03:26:31.300
Will it be on Steam?

03:26:31.300 --> 03:26:33.300
No, it is an itch-y-o game.

03:26:33.300 --> 03:26:35.300
It is wildly inappropriate for Steam.

03:26:35.300 --> 03:26:37.300
Haha.

03:26:37.300 --> 03:26:39.300
Ah, Sneaky's.

03:26:39.300 --> 03:26:40.300
Go away.

03:26:40.300 --> 03:26:41.300
Leave me alone.

03:26:41.300 --> 03:26:43.300
Uh-uh-uh.

03:26:43.300 --> 03:26:45.300
I don't want to hear it.

03:26:45.300 --> 03:26:47.300
Where the heck did I go?

03:26:47.300 --> 03:26:49.300
I don't know.

03:26:49.300 --> 03:26:50.300
I will buy it.

03:26:50.300 --> 03:26:53.300
Well, speaking of buying it, it's completely free.

03:26:53.300 --> 03:26:55.300
You do not need to give me any money.

03:26:55.300 --> 03:26:59.300
It was a developmental decision

03:26:59.300 --> 03:27:01.300
in order to promote the girls,

03:27:01.300 --> 03:27:04.300
and everyone can get a bit of a taste of the girls,

03:27:04.300 --> 03:27:05.300
if you will.

03:27:05.300 --> 03:27:08.300
Um, I opted to make the game free.

03:27:08.300 --> 03:27:10.300
You do not have to pay for it.

03:27:10.300 --> 03:27:12.300
It cost a pretty penny to produce,

03:27:12.300 --> 03:27:15.300
but that, ultimately, was my decision.

03:27:15.300 --> 03:27:17.300
Um...

03:27:19.300 --> 03:27:22.300
It's definitely a good learning experience.

03:27:22.300 --> 03:27:24.300
Oh, it's bugging me, sorry.

03:27:24.300 --> 03:27:27.300
Meekoo's big fan, thank you very much for the 10 gifted.

03:27:27.300 --> 03:27:29.300
Congrats to who gets that.

03:27:29.300 --> 03:27:31.300
Yeah, it's definitely the girl.

03:27:33.300 --> 03:27:35.300
Um...

03:27:35.300 --> 03:27:37.300
Hello?

03:27:37.300 --> 03:27:39.300
I am just a child.

03:27:39.300 --> 03:27:41.300
Leave me alone.

03:27:41.300 --> 03:27:43.300
Hello?

03:27:43.300 --> 03:27:44.300
I don't...

03:27:44.300 --> 03:27:46.300
Okay, I can hit his back if he does that.

03:27:46.300 --> 03:27:47.300
Right.

03:27:47.300 --> 03:27:48.300
Oh my gosh.

03:27:48.300 --> 03:27:50.300
What if we want to pay for it anyway?

03:27:50.300 --> 03:27:53.300
Um, just support any of the girls then?

03:27:53.300 --> 03:27:55.300
Um...

03:27:55.300 --> 03:27:57.300
The publisher can also be tipped

03:27:57.300 --> 03:27:59.300
if you really like his work.

03:27:59.300 --> 03:28:01.300
Um...

03:28:01.300 --> 03:28:03.300
Oh, it's golden.

03:28:03.300 --> 03:28:05.300
It's golden, why would it be golden?

03:28:06.300 --> 03:28:08.300
Um, but yeah, it's free.

03:28:08.300 --> 03:28:11.300
If you want to tip and be like, thanks for the game...

03:28:11.300 --> 03:28:13.300
What if we want to pay for it anyway though?

03:28:13.300 --> 03:28:14.300
Um...

03:28:14.300 --> 03:28:16.300
If you ever felt so inclined, support any of the girls

03:28:16.300 --> 03:28:18.300
or if you want to directly do it to me,

03:28:18.300 --> 03:28:21.300
then do it to me, like on stream elements

03:28:21.300 --> 03:28:23.300
is the best way to do it.

03:28:23.300 --> 03:28:25.300
Or Patreon, to be honest.

03:28:25.300 --> 03:28:27.300
Like, even if like...

03:28:27.300 --> 03:28:29.300
Some people are like, oh, I feel really bad.

03:28:29.300 --> 03:28:31.300
I've only got like five bucks to give.

03:28:31.300 --> 03:28:33.300
You don't, like...

03:28:33.300 --> 03:28:34.300
What's the word?

03:28:34.300 --> 03:28:36.300
It's like such a cascade in effect.

03:28:36.300 --> 03:28:38.300
I don't know where the heck...

03:28:38.300 --> 03:28:39.300
I'm supposed to go.

03:28:39.300 --> 03:28:41.300
I'm like rambling through the swamp section.

03:28:41.300 --> 03:28:42.300
I'm so sorry.

03:28:42.300 --> 03:28:43.300
Um...

03:28:43.300 --> 03:28:46.300
Like, it adds up incredibly...

03:28:46.300 --> 03:28:48.300
Oh, I'll take that, thank you very much.

03:28:48.300 --> 03:28:50.300
Um, it adds up incredibly quickly.

03:28:50.300 --> 03:28:52.300
Like, never be like, oh, I feel bad that I can't like,

03:28:52.300 --> 03:28:54.300
give any money, I can't do this, I can't do that.

03:28:54.300 --> 03:28:56.300
Like, don't ever feel like that because

03:28:56.300 --> 03:28:58.300
the money like adds up so fricking...

03:28:58.300 --> 03:29:00.300
Here's my pre-order in the game.

03:29:00.300 --> 03:29:03.300
The game is free.

03:29:03.300 --> 03:29:05.300
You don't need to give any money.

03:29:06.300 --> 03:29:09.300
Right, I've got a golden piece.

03:29:09.300 --> 03:29:11.300
Is it here, I'm supposed to go?

03:29:11.300 --> 03:29:14.300
Oh, I'm getting all turned around now.

03:29:16.300 --> 03:29:18.300
There's a cavern here.

03:29:21.300 --> 03:29:22.300
Oh, how much do you want?

03:29:22.300 --> 03:29:25.300
I want to sell you arrows, but you don't have a bow.

03:29:27.300 --> 03:29:28.300
What was I saying again?

03:29:28.300 --> 03:29:31.300
I've already forgotten my fricking subject!

03:29:31.300 --> 03:29:32.300
Right.

03:29:33.300 --> 03:29:35.300
I don't think so, at least.

03:29:36.300 --> 03:29:37.300
Um...

03:29:38.300 --> 03:29:40.300
Bro, where am I supposed to go?

03:29:41.300 --> 03:29:43.300
I'm going like, all the wrong ways.

03:29:46.300 --> 03:29:49.300
I assume this is a dead end until I get yours.

03:29:50.300 --> 03:29:52.300
Oh, I don't know how I've successfully gone the wrong way.

03:29:52.300 --> 03:29:53.300
Like, eight times now?

03:29:53.300 --> 03:29:55.300
I've already been here.

03:29:55.300 --> 03:29:56.300
You know...

03:29:58.300 --> 03:30:00.300
Did I come down here?

03:30:00.300 --> 03:30:01.300
I did.

03:30:01.300 --> 03:30:03.300
Is there anything else here though?

03:30:13.300 --> 03:30:14.300
I think I'm special needs.

03:30:14.300 --> 03:30:15.300
Hold on.

03:30:16.300 --> 03:30:18.300
Sorry, I need to try hard.

03:30:18.300 --> 03:30:21.300
I don't know where I'm to go.

03:30:25.300 --> 03:30:29.300
I've got a keystone piece that was golden, right?

03:30:30.300 --> 03:30:35.300
No, that is one nasty looking statue that I had evil glower to.

03:30:38.300 --> 03:30:39.300
Hold on.

03:30:40.300 --> 03:30:43.300
Sorry, I'm genuinely unsure what to do.

03:30:43.300 --> 03:30:45.300
I've already been down there.

03:30:45.300 --> 03:30:48.300
I've already been here, and then this looks like a dead end,

03:30:48.300 --> 03:30:51.300
but I don't go down it, so maybe this isn't a dead end,

03:30:51.300 --> 03:30:53.300
and I'm just the top of the damn thing?

03:30:56.300 --> 03:30:57.300
So it is a dead end.

03:30:58.300 --> 03:30:59.300
Hold on.

03:30:59.300 --> 03:31:00.300
Processing.

03:31:00.300 --> 03:31:01.300
What?

03:31:01.300 --> 03:31:04.300
It says get a bow, but I didn't have a bow.

03:31:07.300 --> 03:31:09.300
The wee mushroom guy.

03:31:09.300 --> 03:31:10.300
The business scrub.

03:31:11.300 --> 03:31:13.300
Which is me, by the way.

03:31:13.300 --> 03:31:15.300
Oh, idiot features!

03:31:15.300 --> 03:31:18.300
Pegasus boots to get me across here.

03:31:20.300 --> 03:31:22.300
Oh, not the water though, Link.

03:31:22.300 --> 03:31:23.300
Not the water though.

03:31:24.300 --> 03:31:26.300
Yeah, sorry, that...

03:31:26.300 --> 03:31:28.300
That must have been painfully obvious.

03:31:28.300 --> 03:31:29.300
I do apologise.

03:31:29.300 --> 03:31:31.300
Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.

03:31:31.300 --> 03:31:33.300
Go across the swamp water.

03:31:34.300 --> 03:31:35.300
Okay, what is this?

03:31:35.300 --> 03:31:37.300
Ah, we're working this before.

03:31:37.300 --> 03:31:38.300
Sorry.

03:31:42.300 --> 03:31:44.300
Oh, look at the flowers.

03:31:45.300 --> 03:31:46.300
What's beautiful.

03:31:46.300 --> 03:31:47.300
Um...

03:31:49.300 --> 03:31:53.300
Yes, I made the decision to make the game free for promotional reasons.

03:31:56.300 --> 03:31:57.300
The game is not out.

03:31:57.300 --> 03:31:58.300
Thank you for the money.

03:31:58.300 --> 03:31:59.300
The game is not out.

03:31:59.300 --> 03:32:01.300
I do apologise, the lay lover,

03:32:01.300 --> 03:32:02.300
but thank you for the money.

03:32:07.300 --> 03:32:08.300
I'm getting spanked about.

03:32:12.300 --> 03:32:13.300
I'm spamming, I'm spamming.

03:32:14.300 --> 03:32:16.300
Oh my god, is this a bow and arrow?

03:32:18.300 --> 03:32:19.300
Oh, thank god, we've got a bow.

03:32:19.300 --> 03:32:20.300
Right, we've got a bow.

03:32:21.300 --> 03:32:22.300
The game...

03:32:23.300 --> 03:32:26.300
It will be tweeted about from all the girls' accounts

03:32:26.300 --> 03:32:28.300
and all of that jazz, so don't worry.

03:32:28.300 --> 03:32:30.300
You'll know when it comes out.

03:32:30.300 --> 03:32:31.300
It's still in development,

03:32:31.300 --> 03:32:33.300
but the base is there.

03:32:35.300 --> 03:32:37.300
Waiting on animated artwork to come back.

03:32:37.300 --> 03:32:39.300
And then I just need to hand over the audio.

03:32:41.300 --> 03:32:43.300
I need to break all the audios down.

03:32:46.300 --> 03:32:48.300
But it makes the game cheaper if I do the work, so...

03:32:49.300 --> 03:32:51.300
I'm not going to outsource the work,

03:32:51.300 --> 03:32:52.300
but thank you again for the tip.

03:32:54.300 --> 03:32:57.300
The name of it is a pun.

03:32:57.300 --> 03:32:59.300
Is anyone surprised at this point?

03:32:59.300 --> 03:33:00.300
The answer is...

03:33:01.300 --> 03:33:03.300
Okay, let's go back this way.

03:33:07.300 --> 03:33:09.300
Okay, okay, now that we have the bow,

03:33:09.300 --> 03:33:11.300
we can poke them in the eyes.

03:33:12.300 --> 03:33:13.300
Oh, that wasn't very nice.

03:33:13.300 --> 03:33:15.300
I'm going to have to admit that wasn't quite mean.

03:33:18.300 --> 03:33:20.300
Let's outsource the audio.

03:33:20.300 --> 03:33:21.300
No, it's like more money.

03:33:21.300 --> 03:33:23.300
I spent a lot of money on the game

03:33:23.300 --> 03:33:25.300
to get it produced.

03:33:26.300 --> 03:33:27.300
I think...

03:33:27.300 --> 03:33:28.300
Oh, I don't know.

03:33:28.300 --> 03:33:30.300
Should I say it out loud?

03:33:34.300 --> 03:33:36.300
It's over 10,000 US dollars.

03:33:36.300 --> 03:33:37.300
How about that?

03:33:37.300 --> 03:33:38.300
It took me 10,000.

03:33:38.300 --> 03:33:40.300
And I know someone's going to play

03:33:40.300 --> 03:33:41.300
and be like,

03:33:41.300 --> 03:33:42.300
this game's shit.

03:33:42.300 --> 03:33:43.300
I can't believe you paid that much money for it.

03:33:43.300 --> 03:33:44.300
And it's like, bro,

03:33:44.300 --> 03:33:46.300
I'm going to just fucking relax.

03:33:46.300 --> 03:33:47.300
Oh, yeah.

03:33:49.300 --> 03:33:51.300
Game development isn't cheap.

03:33:51.300 --> 03:33:52.300
It isn't easy.

03:33:52.300 --> 03:33:53.300
It isn't fast.

03:33:53.300 --> 03:33:54.300
It isn't this.

03:33:54.300 --> 03:33:55.300
It isn't that.

03:33:55.300 --> 03:33:56.300
What the heck is this?

03:33:56.300 --> 03:33:57.300
Hello, Mr. Gravestone.

03:34:03.300 --> 03:34:04.300
Two more.

03:34:04.300 --> 03:34:05.300
10K.

03:34:05.300 --> 03:34:06.300
Oh, it's a bit more than that,

03:34:06.300 --> 03:34:08.300
but I'll say it's 10K.

03:34:08.300 --> 03:34:10.300
Though my body may have perished.

03:34:10.300 --> 03:34:13.300
Strongly be voicing by Chris Pratt.

03:34:13.300 --> 03:34:14.300
No.

03:34:14.300 --> 03:34:15.300
Someone was like,

03:34:15.300 --> 03:34:17.300
I don't have a male voice in the game.

03:34:17.300 --> 03:34:18.300
I was like,

03:34:18.300 --> 03:34:20.300
why on earth would the male voice be in the game

03:34:20.300 --> 03:34:22.300
if the entire point of the game is to

03:34:22.300 --> 03:34:24.300
be allure?

03:34:24.300 --> 03:34:27.300
Why would there randomly be a male voice?

03:34:27.300 --> 03:34:29.300
Moment is too generous.

03:34:29.300 --> 03:34:31.300
Though my body may perish,

03:34:31.300 --> 03:34:33.300
I'm still a true swordsman of Hyrule.

03:34:33.300 --> 03:34:35.300
Swiftblade, the first spirit of a swordsman.

03:34:35.300 --> 03:34:36.300
If you train with me,

03:34:36.300 --> 03:34:37.300
I will teach you skills that,

03:34:37.300 --> 03:34:39.300
hmm, it seems you're not ready to train with me.

03:34:39.300 --> 03:34:40.300
Come back when you have...

03:34:43.300 --> 03:34:44.300
I'll come all this way in a swamp.

03:34:45.300 --> 03:34:46.300
And you're telling...

03:34:46.300 --> 03:34:47.300
Okay, I'm not that mad,

03:34:47.300 --> 03:34:49.300
because there was a Kinstone piece outside the Gravestone.

03:34:49.300 --> 03:34:51.300
I'll let it slide this time.

03:34:55.300 --> 03:34:56.300
Bitches.

03:34:58.300 --> 03:34:59.300
I already know

03:35:01.300 --> 03:35:02.300
what game

03:35:02.300 --> 03:35:04.300
I want to produce

03:35:04.300 --> 03:35:06.300
for Gen 2.

03:35:06.300 --> 03:35:08.300
Every generation is going to have a free

03:35:08.300 --> 03:35:11.300
access kind of game.

03:35:11.300 --> 03:35:13.300
And I already know what

03:35:13.300 --> 03:35:15.300
the...

03:35:15.300 --> 03:35:17.300
I'm drowning.

03:35:17.300 --> 03:35:19.300
I'm drowning again.

03:35:19.300 --> 03:35:21.300
I already know what the other game types

03:35:21.300 --> 03:35:22.300
are going to be.

03:35:22.300 --> 03:35:24.300
I hope people find it humorous,

03:35:24.300 --> 03:35:27.300
because it's kind of a parody of...

03:35:30.300 --> 03:35:32.300
Oh, that's what the golden...

03:35:32.300 --> 03:35:33.300
Oh, we need to go back.

03:35:33.300 --> 03:35:34.300
We need to go back.

03:35:34.300 --> 03:35:35.300
We've gone too far.

03:35:35.300 --> 03:35:36.300
We need to go back.

03:35:37.300 --> 03:35:39.300
Wait, so there's going to be voice acting?

03:35:39.300 --> 03:35:40.300
Yeah, by us.

03:35:40.300 --> 03:35:41.300
By all the viewers,

03:35:41.300 --> 03:35:43.300
the girls have already recorded their lines.

03:35:44.300 --> 03:35:46.300
Now, I will say one thing.

03:35:47.300 --> 03:35:49.300
The lines were very important

03:35:49.300 --> 03:35:51.300
to be recorded first.

03:35:51.300 --> 03:35:53.300
So, before you're like,

03:35:53.300 --> 03:35:55.300
this person doesn't sound that confident.

03:35:55.300 --> 03:35:57.300
Yeah, probably because it was very early

03:35:57.300 --> 03:35:59.300
into knowing each other.

03:35:59.300 --> 03:36:00.300
And I sent them the script,

03:36:00.300 --> 03:36:03.300
and some of them have good experience.

03:36:03.300 --> 03:36:05.300
Some of them are kind of new to it,

03:36:05.300 --> 03:36:07.300
but are aware of the...

03:36:07.300 --> 03:36:09.300
I'll push that down.

03:36:12.300 --> 03:36:14.300
Does he come after me?

03:36:14.300 --> 03:36:15.300
I don't know.

03:36:16.300 --> 03:36:18.300
Is it an FPS stereo?

03:36:18.300 --> 03:36:19.300
No.

03:36:19.300 --> 03:36:21.300
It's not like a full, developed AAA title.

03:36:21.300 --> 03:36:23.300
It's literally to play one-handed.

03:36:23.300 --> 03:36:24.300
There's not much more to it.

03:36:24.300 --> 03:36:26.300
Where am I supposed to go?

03:36:26.300 --> 03:36:28.300
Am I supposed to go down?

03:36:28.300 --> 03:36:30.300
No, I'm supposed to go over here.

03:36:31.300 --> 03:36:32.300
Overwatch 3.

03:36:32.300 --> 03:36:34.300
No, I did not produce Overwatch 3.

03:36:34.300 --> 03:36:36.300
Literally, it's just a one-handed game,

03:36:36.300 --> 03:36:38.300
but games are not easy to produce.

03:36:38.300 --> 03:36:40.300
Easy or cheap to produce.

03:36:40.300 --> 03:36:42.300
And I still need to pay the artist.

03:36:42.300 --> 03:36:44.300
I forgot to pay the artist.

03:36:44.300 --> 03:36:46.300
Is it other 50%?

03:36:46.300 --> 03:36:48.300
Oh, right, we just need one more piece now.

03:36:48.300 --> 03:36:50.300
That's fantastic.

03:36:54.300 --> 03:36:56.300
We can go back up here.

03:36:56.300 --> 03:36:58.300
Then we need to claim up.

03:37:02.300 --> 03:37:04.300
If Blizzard had any sense,

03:37:04.300 --> 03:37:06.300
Overwatch 3 would be a one-handed game too.

03:37:06.300 --> 03:37:08.300
No, that's so good.

03:37:08.300 --> 03:37:10.300
That's terrible, but that's not good.

03:37:21.300 --> 03:37:23.300
Let's do this.

03:37:23.300 --> 03:37:25.300
Okay, the Pegasus.

03:37:25.300 --> 03:37:27.300
Probably see there's only one thing about this game

03:37:27.300 --> 03:37:29.300
is we have to constantly go in the menus.

03:37:29.300 --> 03:37:31.300
I need to push this down, actually.

03:37:35.300 --> 03:37:37.300
Question mark, we did it.

03:37:38.300 --> 03:37:39.300
Yes!

03:37:39.300 --> 03:37:41.300
Okay, we can go straight back again.

03:37:41.300 --> 03:37:44.300
And we don't need arrows from that guy,

03:37:44.300 --> 03:37:46.300
because we're already full.

03:37:46.300 --> 03:37:48.300
Yes, the Overwatch industry

03:37:48.300 --> 03:37:50.300
is probably bigger than the playable...

03:37:50.300 --> 03:37:52.300
Oh, I do not doubt it.

03:37:52.300 --> 03:37:56.300
I'm sorry, they absolutely ran that game to the ground.

03:37:56.300 --> 03:37:58.300
I'm like, hope it was worth it.

03:37:58.300 --> 03:38:00.300
I genuinely hope it was worth it.

03:38:00.300 --> 03:38:02.300
Although it's saying that...

03:38:02.300 --> 03:38:04.300
What's that game?

03:38:04.300 --> 03:38:06.300
Valorant?

03:38:06.300 --> 03:38:08.300
All they do is sell...

03:38:08.300 --> 03:38:10.300
It's a free-to-play,

03:38:10.300 --> 03:38:12.300
but all they do is that skin stuff as well.

03:38:12.300 --> 03:38:14.300
And they've found pretty good success,

03:38:14.300 --> 03:38:16.300
so...

03:38:16.300 --> 03:38:18.300
Maybe...

03:38:18.300 --> 03:38:20.300
Is that what I should do?

03:38:20.300 --> 03:38:22.300
I should put skins behind a paywall.

03:38:22.300 --> 03:38:23.300
That's ridiculous.

03:38:23.300 --> 03:38:25.300
Then what's behind here?

03:38:27.300 --> 03:38:29.300
That noise.

03:38:29.300 --> 03:38:32.300
Wait, don't he coax them to me?

03:38:32.300 --> 03:38:34.300
Okay, now come this way.

03:38:37.300 --> 03:38:40.300
He does look awfully venison.

03:38:43.300 --> 03:38:45.300
Oh, it's just for a chest.

03:38:45.300 --> 03:38:47.300
Oh, okay, it's blue.

03:38:47.300 --> 03:38:48.300
Oh!

03:38:50.300 --> 03:38:52.300
I'm too skilled.

03:38:55.300 --> 03:38:57.300
I didn't trust that when they popped off.

03:38:57.300 --> 03:39:00.300
I was like, they did not come out of the grass.

03:39:00.300 --> 03:39:02.300
I knew they didn't come out of the grass.

03:39:02.300 --> 03:39:05.300
Probably because Valorant was sold as a PvP.

03:39:06.300 --> 03:39:08.300
So it didn't have hint for the camp.

03:39:08.300 --> 03:39:10.300
Wait, you're still in my way?

03:39:11.300 --> 03:39:13.300
Oh my god, stop for real, for real.

03:39:14.300 --> 03:39:16.300
Can't go that way, which is...

03:39:16.300 --> 03:39:18.300
Fane.

03:39:18.300 --> 03:39:20.300
I've already forgotten how to get...

03:39:20.300 --> 03:39:22.300
I think I need to go up again,

03:39:22.300 --> 03:39:25.300
and then do that swamp route in order to get where I need to go?

03:39:27.300 --> 03:39:30.300
Yes, I do need to do the swamp route, which is fine.

03:39:36.300 --> 03:39:38.300
Huh?

03:39:38.300 --> 03:39:39.300
I don't know.

03:39:39.300 --> 03:39:40.300
I forgot.

03:39:40.300 --> 03:39:41.300
Wait, how did I get up there?

03:39:41.300 --> 03:39:42.300
Ah, okay, okay.

03:39:42.300 --> 03:39:44.300
Stab them in the eye.

03:39:44.300 --> 03:39:46.300
Yeah, honestly, I'd be pretty enraged, too,

03:39:46.300 --> 03:39:47.300
if that happened to me.

03:39:47.300 --> 03:39:48.300
I'd be mad.

03:39:52.300 --> 03:39:54.300
Can I get any cannons?

03:39:54.300 --> 03:39:55.300
Please.

03:39:55.300 --> 03:39:57.300
This one, please.

03:39:59.300 --> 03:40:01.300
Thanks for joining.

03:40:01.300 --> 03:40:04.300
I say that as if I'm not about to go off in 20 minutes,

03:40:04.300 --> 03:40:07.300
because I need to do my forbidden tier stream.

03:40:07.300 --> 03:40:11.300
Whoa, I made that by a centimeter.

03:40:12.300 --> 03:40:13.300
By a millimeter.

03:40:13.300 --> 03:40:16.300
Wait, no, this isn't where I'm supposed to go.

03:40:16.300 --> 03:40:18.300
But it's near here.

03:40:18.300 --> 03:40:20.300
I just need to get done.

03:40:21.300 --> 03:40:23.300
Okay, okay, we did it, we did it.

03:40:26.300 --> 03:40:29.300
Two Kenstone pieces fit perfectly together.

03:40:31.300 --> 03:40:32.300
Bunk.

03:40:33.300 --> 03:40:36.300
And they're last, but certainly not least.

03:40:37.300 --> 03:40:39.300
Don't forget to eat a set of me.

03:40:39.300 --> 03:40:41.300
I absolutely will not forget.

03:40:41.300 --> 03:40:44.300
I actually need to get the thumbnail to put up the member stream.

03:40:44.300 --> 03:40:46.300
I'll put it 15 minutes past,

03:40:46.300 --> 03:40:49.300
because I might need to squeeze out a loaf of bread.

03:40:49.300 --> 03:40:54.300
I think the painkillers are making my loaf of bread

03:40:54.300 --> 03:40:56.300
severely impacted.

03:40:56.300 --> 03:40:58.300
That's terrible.

03:40:59.300 --> 03:41:01.300
And a couple more hours of member stream.

03:41:01.300 --> 03:41:02.300
No.

03:41:03.300 --> 03:41:06.300
I'm going to redirect into Emmy when she goes up,

03:41:06.300 --> 03:41:08.300
and then 15 minutes later, the member stream will be there.

03:41:08.300 --> 03:41:10.300
Like, I'll put it up, don't worry.

03:41:10.300 --> 03:41:12.300
The heck with you.

03:41:14.300 --> 03:41:15.300
Ooh.

03:41:16.300 --> 03:41:18.300
Oh, I don't like you.

03:41:18.300 --> 03:41:19.300
Oh, I can perish you though.

03:41:19.300 --> 03:41:20.300
That's fine.

03:41:20.300 --> 03:41:21.300
Okay.

03:41:21.300 --> 03:41:22.300
Yeah, just stay stuck on that.

03:41:22.300 --> 03:41:23.300
That's fine.

03:41:23.300 --> 03:41:24.300
You don't scare me.

03:41:25.300 --> 03:41:29.300
Is the tier list at the same time as Emmy?

03:41:29.300 --> 03:41:31.300
Yes, but it'll stay up.

03:41:31.300 --> 03:41:33.300
Whoa, what was that enemy?

03:41:33.300 --> 03:41:34.300
I saw that.

03:41:35.300 --> 03:41:36.300
I saw that.

03:41:37.300 --> 03:41:38.300
We'll grab it.

03:41:38.300 --> 03:41:39.300
We'll grab it.

03:41:39.300 --> 03:41:42.300
We need all the moonies and...

03:41:48.300 --> 03:41:49.300
Ah, perfect.

03:41:49.300 --> 03:41:50.300
We got a red one.

03:41:50.300 --> 03:41:51.300
Hello.

03:41:51.300 --> 03:41:54.300
These soldier statues here were built by the Minish ages ago

03:41:54.300 --> 03:41:55.300
to help humans.

03:41:55.300 --> 03:41:56.300
It's kind of a secret,

03:41:56.300 --> 03:41:59.300
but there's a switch inside that turns them on or off.

03:41:59.300 --> 03:42:01.300
A switch, you say?

03:42:01.300 --> 03:42:03.300
Conditioning, you say?

03:42:03.300 --> 03:42:04.300
So nice.

03:42:07.300 --> 03:42:08.300
I was going to say,

03:42:08.300 --> 03:42:10.300
I'm sure you can climb these guys.

03:42:10.300 --> 03:42:12.300
Right, now that he's activated,

03:42:12.300 --> 03:42:15.300
he will wake up and you just stole his stuff.

03:42:15.300 --> 03:42:16.300
Literally, hi!

03:42:16.300 --> 03:42:18.300
Opens chest first, doesn't even greet him.

03:42:22.300 --> 03:42:25.300
Oh, he actually bounces me back.

03:42:25.300 --> 03:42:27.300
He's that much of a talent.

03:42:27.300 --> 03:42:28.300
Honestly.

03:42:29.300 --> 03:42:31.300
I see that thing.

03:42:32.300 --> 03:42:33.300
I see it.

03:42:35.300 --> 03:42:37.300
I actually don't think we're going to have enough time

03:42:37.300 --> 03:42:39.300
to do the freaking dungeon.

03:42:42.300 --> 03:42:44.300
What's Emmy doing today?

03:42:47.300 --> 03:42:50.300
Be honest, what game's Emmy playing?

03:42:51.300 --> 03:42:53.300
Is she doing a two-hour stream?

03:42:53.300 --> 03:42:55.300
Or is she doing ASMR?

03:43:00.300 --> 03:43:02.300
Do you want me to do the member stream

03:43:02.300 --> 03:43:04.300
two hours after Emmy starts?

03:43:04.300 --> 03:43:06.300
Because Azur is off

03:43:06.300 --> 03:43:08.300
and Mercy's off.

03:43:08.300 --> 03:43:10.300
And I don't think Emmy would do ASMR

03:43:10.300 --> 03:43:12.300
more than two hours because it gets a bit

03:43:12.300 --> 03:43:14.300
really sore in the voice after two hours.

03:43:14.300 --> 03:43:17.300
Brainwashing ASMR, yeah, it's my Emmy.

03:43:17.300 --> 03:43:19.300
Shibuya's at eight.

03:43:19.300 --> 03:43:21.300
Wait, I thought Shibuya was off.

03:43:21.300 --> 03:43:22.300
Wait.

03:43:24.300 --> 03:43:27.300
Oh, is Sheepster's a bit later?

03:43:31.300 --> 03:43:33.300
As much as I would love to watch the member stream,

03:43:33.300 --> 03:43:35.300
I want to watch Emmy.

03:43:38.300 --> 03:43:40.300
If that's the case,

03:43:42.300 --> 03:43:44.300
I can play this game for another two hours

03:43:44.300 --> 03:43:46.300
and then whoever wants to watch Emmy

03:43:46.300 --> 03:43:48.300
can go watch Emmy.

03:43:50.300 --> 03:43:53.300
I don't know, this game is nasty looking.

03:43:54.300 --> 03:43:55.300
We are so back.

03:43:55.300 --> 03:43:56.300
What a name!

03:43:56.300 --> 03:43:58.300
Oh my god, your icons!

03:43:58.300 --> 03:44:00.300
We ace the call.

03:44:00.300 --> 03:44:01.300
That's so precious.

03:44:01.300 --> 03:44:03.300
I love when you guys have like

03:44:03.300 --> 03:44:05.300
the girls'...

03:44:05.300 --> 03:44:07.300
Let's get rid of the snakes first

03:44:07.300 --> 03:44:09.300
because they are scary.

03:44:09.300 --> 03:44:11.300
I love when you guys have the girls'

03:44:11.300 --> 03:44:13.300
oh-she-marks or like their profile pictures

03:44:13.300 --> 03:44:15.300
them or their name is there.

03:44:15.300 --> 03:44:17.300
I'm just like, oh, my bye-bye.

03:44:17.300 --> 03:44:19.300
I'm so glad you guys can enjoy it.

03:44:19.300 --> 03:44:21.300
Draco, thank you for coming.

03:44:21.300 --> 03:44:22.300
Remember?

03:44:22.300 --> 03:44:24.300
Oh, I'm glad I caught that grass.

03:44:24.300 --> 03:44:25.300
I didn't realize.

03:44:25.300 --> 03:44:27.300
I thought it was going to restart.

03:44:28.300 --> 03:44:30.300
I heart you very much.

03:44:30.300 --> 03:44:31.300
Yes.

03:44:32.300 --> 03:44:34.300
It was concepted that A.C.

03:44:34.300 --> 03:44:36.300
So I've...

03:44:36.300 --> 03:44:37.300
I haven't said it.

03:44:37.300 --> 03:44:39.300
Obviously only the development team

03:44:39.300 --> 03:44:40.300
could see the designs.

03:44:40.300 --> 03:44:42.300
And A.C. by far was voted

03:44:42.300 --> 03:44:45.300
the most well-liked

03:44:45.300 --> 03:44:47.300
designer...

03:44:47.300 --> 03:44:48.300
whatever...

03:44:48.300 --> 03:44:49.300
whatever.

03:44:51.300 --> 03:44:53.300
So...

03:44:53.300 --> 03:44:55.300
we popped her

03:44:55.300 --> 03:44:57.300
in my

03:44:57.300 --> 03:44:59.300
lore video

03:44:59.300 --> 03:45:01.300
and it was a cute little kind of like cameo.

03:45:01.300 --> 03:45:03.300
I can even call it a cameo.

03:45:04.300 --> 03:45:05.300
She would just...

03:45:05.300 --> 03:45:06.300
she's the muse

03:45:06.300 --> 03:45:08.300
because obviously my lore

03:45:08.300 --> 03:45:10.300
was people had already

03:45:10.300 --> 03:45:13.300
hypnotized themselves

03:45:14.300 --> 03:45:15.300
to

03:45:17.300 --> 03:45:19.300
be watching VTubers,

03:45:19.300 --> 03:45:21.300
which was a quite like the...

03:45:21.300 --> 03:45:23.300
the charisma

03:45:23.300 --> 03:45:25.300
of the charisma.

03:45:26.300 --> 03:45:28.300
We just turned everyone off.

03:45:28.300 --> 03:45:29.300
It's that easy.

03:45:30.300 --> 03:45:32.300
I think that A.C.

03:45:32.300 --> 03:45:34.300
smart in gameplay capture

03:45:34.300 --> 03:45:36.300
to different audiences.

03:45:36.300 --> 03:45:37.300
Yes.

03:45:37.300 --> 03:45:38.300
If you...

03:45:38.300 --> 03:45:40.300
if you want to watch Immers,

03:45:40.300 --> 03:45:41.300
my little Immers...

03:45:42.300 --> 03:45:43.300
Wait a minute.

03:45:45.300 --> 03:45:47.300
Wait, a diddly dying minute.

03:45:49.300 --> 03:45:51.300
I think I need to perish those guys.

03:45:51.300 --> 03:45:52.300
I don't know.

03:45:52.300 --> 03:45:54.300
Maybe another time right now.

03:45:54.300 --> 03:45:55.300
Let's just get there.

03:45:57.300 --> 03:45:58.300
The Conqueror?

03:45:58.300 --> 03:46:00.300
A.C. having a rough day?

03:46:00.300 --> 03:46:01.300
Is she alright?

03:46:03.300 --> 03:46:06.300
Oh, I can destroy these with my sword now.

03:46:07.300 --> 03:46:09.300
Sorry, I'll just do some edging

03:46:09.300 --> 03:46:11.300
on the grass.

03:46:11.300 --> 03:46:12.300
If you didn't know that

03:46:12.300 --> 03:46:13.300
is actually the terminology,

03:46:13.300 --> 03:46:14.300
cheeky edging.

03:46:14.300 --> 03:46:16.300
Wait, who...

03:46:18.300 --> 03:46:19.300
Oh, I do have to defeat

03:46:19.300 --> 03:46:21.300
the other guys right there.

03:46:21.300 --> 03:46:22.300
Did I do it?

03:46:22.300 --> 03:46:24.300
Am I going to come back to this area?

03:46:24.300 --> 03:46:25.300
Probably not.

03:46:26.300 --> 03:46:27.300
It is called A.C.I.N.

03:46:27.300 --> 03:46:28.300
If you're a gardener,

03:46:28.300 --> 03:46:29.300
it's called A.C.I.N.

03:46:29.300 --> 03:46:30.300
That's called A.C.I.N.

03:46:31.300 --> 03:46:32.300
Just a little...

03:46:32.300 --> 03:46:33.300
no, literally like on the...

03:46:33.300 --> 03:46:35.300
fortress of wind.

03:46:36.300 --> 03:46:37.300
What is all...

03:46:37.300 --> 03:46:39.300
Well, there's so many rooms

03:46:39.300 --> 03:46:40.300
you can explore.

03:46:42.300 --> 03:46:44.300
Okay, do not touch that.

03:46:44.300 --> 03:46:45.300
Let's not do that again.

03:46:47.300 --> 03:46:48.300
Hmm.

03:46:48.300 --> 03:46:49.300
To think the rooms were hidden

03:46:49.300 --> 03:46:51.300
within this cliff the whole time.

03:46:51.300 --> 03:46:52.300
Watch your step, Link.

03:46:52.300 --> 03:46:54.300
There may be traps in here.

03:46:54.300 --> 03:46:55.300
Hmm.

03:46:57.300 --> 03:46:58.300
Well, there might be traps here,

03:46:58.300 --> 03:46:59.300
but what about the Fen Boys?

03:46:59.300 --> 03:47:00.300
Okay, well...

03:47:01.300 --> 03:47:02.300
I tried, I tried.

03:47:02.300 --> 03:47:03.300
Geez.

03:47:03.300 --> 03:47:04.300
Can't impress them all.

03:47:07.300 --> 03:47:08.300
Hydration check.

03:47:09.300 --> 03:47:10.300
Um...

03:47:10.300 --> 03:47:11.300
Right, I will tell you

03:47:11.300 --> 03:47:12.300
when Amy goes live

03:47:12.300 --> 03:47:13.300
and YouTube mods you have

03:47:13.300 --> 03:47:14.300
permission to talk

03:47:14.300 --> 03:47:15.300
when Amy does go live.

03:47:16.300 --> 03:47:17.300
Um...

03:47:17.300 --> 03:47:18.300
And we will play...

03:47:19.300 --> 03:47:20.300
Oh!

03:47:21.300 --> 03:47:22.300
Oh, no, this can't be.

03:47:23.300 --> 03:47:24.300
Oh, no, this can't be.

03:47:25.300 --> 03:47:26.300
Oh, no, this can't be.

03:47:26.300 --> 03:47:27.300
Oh, no, this can't be.

03:47:27.300 --> 03:47:28.300
Oh, no, this can't be.

03:47:28.300 --> 03:47:29.300
Oh, no, this can't be.

03:47:30.300 --> 03:47:31.300
Oh, please don't touch me.

03:47:37.300 --> 03:47:38.300
Wait.

03:47:38.300 --> 03:47:40.300
So, what does the other lever do?

03:47:43.300 --> 03:47:44.300
Jump on someone else's head.

03:47:48.300 --> 03:47:49.300
Okay, there we go.

03:47:51.300 --> 03:47:52.300
Okay, I'll take that.

03:47:52.300 --> 03:47:53.300
Another keystone,

03:47:53.300 --> 03:47:54.300
keystone.

03:47:54.300 --> 03:47:55.300
Don't mind Father.

03:47:56.300 --> 03:47:57.300
Oh!

03:47:59.300 --> 03:48:00.300
Stop, please.

03:48:01.300 --> 03:48:02.300
Sorry, a green chap.

03:48:02.300 --> 03:48:03.300
Do you think Amy

03:48:03.300 --> 03:48:04.300
has happen sizes?

03:48:04.300 --> 03:48:05.300
No.

03:48:06.300 --> 03:48:08.300
Whatever she does is completely

03:48:08.300 --> 03:48:09.300
on her.

03:48:09.300 --> 03:48:11.300
The girls make the content

03:48:11.300 --> 03:48:12.300
they want to make.

03:48:12.300 --> 03:48:13.300
They do what they want to do.

03:48:13.300 --> 03:48:15.300
And that is the lovely

03:48:15.300 --> 03:48:16.300
jiggly way we do it.

03:48:17.300 --> 03:48:18.300
And...

03:48:20.300 --> 03:48:21.300
An unnatural...

03:48:22.300 --> 03:48:23.300
Well...

03:48:23.300 --> 03:48:24.300
Ah!

03:48:24.300 --> 03:48:25.300
I see what I have to do.

03:48:26.300 --> 03:48:27.300
No!

03:48:27.300 --> 03:48:28.300
I just got walloped

03:48:28.300 --> 03:48:29.300
by freaking haunted skulls!

03:48:31.300 --> 03:48:32.300
Fucking get up,

03:48:32.300 --> 03:48:33.300
you lazybump.

03:48:34.300 --> 03:48:35.300
I can't go that way.

03:48:38.300 --> 03:48:39.300
You can deactivate those

03:48:39.300 --> 03:48:40.300
electricity skulls

03:48:40.300 --> 03:48:41.300
with a boomerang.

03:48:41.300 --> 03:48:42.300
Oh, I never bought it.

03:48:42.300 --> 03:48:44.300
It was 300 rupees.

03:48:46.300 --> 03:48:47.300
I can't believe it.

03:48:47.300 --> 03:48:48.300
Poverty strikes again.

03:48:49.300 --> 03:48:50.300
I said get the tinfoil hat on

03:48:50.300 --> 03:48:51.300
right now.

03:48:53.300 --> 03:48:54.300
It's tiring.

03:48:57.300 --> 03:48:58.300
Great.

03:48:58.300 --> 03:48:59.300
Yes.

03:48:59.300 --> 03:49:00.300
That would be the plan.

03:49:00.300 --> 03:49:01.300
We'll play menace

03:49:01.300 --> 03:49:02.300
for another cheeky two hours

03:49:02.300 --> 03:49:03.300
because we're cheeky cheeky.

03:49:04.300 --> 03:49:05.300
Also cheeky bricky.

03:49:06.300 --> 03:49:07.300
And then

03:49:07.300 --> 03:49:08.300
we shall...

03:49:11.300 --> 03:49:13.300
do the forbidden members here.

03:49:15.300 --> 03:49:16.300
And then that way

03:49:16.300 --> 03:49:17.300
everyone's happy.

03:49:18.300 --> 03:49:19.300
And everyone is happy.

03:49:20.300 --> 03:49:21.300
Can I make everyone happy?

03:49:21.300 --> 03:49:22.300
I don't know.

03:49:22.300 --> 03:49:24.300
I sent from the Australians

03:49:24.300 --> 03:49:25.300
because this is

03:49:25.300 --> 03:49:26.300
probably the worst

03:49:26.300 --> 03:49:27.300
time

03:49:29.300 --> 03:49:30.300
we could have asked for.

03:49:31.300 --> 03:49:32.300
A key!

03:49:33.300 --> 03:49:34.300
Can I fall at the bottom

03:49:34.300 --> 03:49:35.300
without taking fall damage?

03:49:38.300 --> 03:49:39.300
Hmm.

03:49:39.300 --> 03:49:40.300
Did someone just fall down

03:49:40.300 --> 03:49:41.300
or was it my imagination?

03:49:42.300 --> 03:49:43.300
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

03:49:43.300 --> 03:49:44.300
Right.

03:49:44.300 --> 03:49:45.300
Let's just take fall damage.

03:49:46.300 --> 03:49:47.300
Speed things along a bit.

03:49:48.300 --> 03:49:49.300
Emmy's going live now.

03:49:49.300 --> 03:49:50.300
I don't know.

03:49:52.300 --> 03:49:53.300
I knew...

03:49:53.300 --> 03:49:54.300
I didn't know you could

03:49:54.300 --> 03:49:55.300
do that with a boomerang

03:49:55.300 --> 03:49:56.300
or something to do with a boomerang.

03:49:58.300 --> 03:49:59.300
Hi.

03:50:01.300 --> 03:50:02.300
What are you getting at?

03:50:02.300 --> 03:50:03.300
Because I'm asked for showing up.

03:50:03.300 --> 03:50:04.300
Wait, what's this?

03:50:07.300 --> 03:50:09.300
Oh, there's so many stompers.

03:50:10.300 --> 03:50:11.300
No, get away.

03:50:11.300 --> 03:50:12.300
I'm no fighting you

03:50:12.300 --> 03:50:13.300
as if you're just going to

03:50:13.300 --> 03:50:14.300
keep respawning.

03:50:16.300 --> 03:50:17.300
I don't have what...

03:50:18.300 --> 03:50:19.300
That is so a rope snake.

03:50:20.300 --> 03:50:21.300
I can tell.

03:50:22.300 --> 03:50:23.300
No fall damage.

03:50:23.300 --> 03:50:24.300
Nah.

03:50:24.300 --> 03:50:25.300
Oh, these are happy.

03:50:25.300 --> 03:50:26.300
Are they?

03:50:27.300 --> 03:50:28.300
4am.

03:50:30.300 --> 03:50:32.300
I guess it's maybe...

03:50:33.300 --> 03:50:34.300
Oh, forget the stick.

03:50:38.300 --> 03:50:39.300
Oh, I'm going to

03:50:39.300 --> 03:50:40.300
freaking run out of health.

03:50:40.300 --> 03:50:41.300
These don't have health.

03:50:41.300 --> 03:50:42.300
Oh, for goodness.

03:50:45.300 --> 03:50:46.300
I suck at this game.

03:50:48.300 --> 03:50:49.300
But your mom swallows at it.

03:50:55.300 --> 03:50:56.300
No.

03:51:03.300 --> 03:51:04.300
Oh, no!

03:51:04.300 --> 03:51:05.300
Did I?

03:51:05.300 --> 03:51:06.300
Please tell me they're

03:51:06.300 --> 03:51:07.300
not all going to respawn.

03:51:08.300 --> 03:51:09.300
Okay, they didn't.

03:51:09.300 --> 03:51:10.300
Thank goodness.

03:51:11.300 --> 03:51:12.300
The one time where

03:51:12.300 --> 03:51:14.300
clearing out stuff actually works.

03:51:15.300 --> 03:51:16.300
I zoned back into that.

03:51:17.300 --> 03:51:18.300
But don't zone out.

03:51:18.300 --> 03:51:19.300
Are you going to...

03:51:21.300 --> 03:51:23.300
Can I actually perish these guys?

03:51:25.300 --> 03:51:26.300
Can I?

03:51:27.300 --> 03:51:28.300
Oh, you can!

03:51:29.300 --> 03:51:30.300
Wait, can I, like,

03:51:30.300 --> 03:51:31.300
fully perish you then?

03:51:35.300 --> 03:51:36.300
That was 2...

03:51:36.300 --> 03:51:37.300
3...

03:51:37.300 --> 03:51:38.300
4.

03:51:38.300 --> 03:51:39.300
Okay.

03:51:39.300 --> 03:51:40.300
I didn't even know that.

03:51:41.300 --> 03:51:42.300
Hello.

03:51:42.300 --> 03:51:43.300
Are you the compass?

03:51:44.300 --> 03:51:46.300
You're the dungeon map split school.

03:51:48.300 --> 03:51:50.300
Well, AC is really going through it now.

03:51:50.300 --> 03:51:51.300
What?

03:51:52.300 --> 03:51:53.300
Did I need to check the disc?

03:51:55.300 --> 03:51:56.300
Did she tweak something?

03:52:01.300 --> 03:52:02.300
Oh, no, she can't tweak.

03:52:02.300 --> 03:52:03.300
She's got her can band.

03:52:03.300 --> 03:52:04.300
One more.

03:52:07.300 --> 03:52:08.300
Am I missing?

03:52:09.300 --> 03:52:10.300
Yeah, she's got her can band.

03:52:15.300 --> 03:52:16.300
My cat is not me on it,

03:52:16.300 --> 03:52:17.300
so I better figure that out.

03:52:20.300 --> 03:52:21.300
Oh, AC got it.

03:52:22.300 --> 03:52:23.300
Damn.

03:52:23.300 --> 03:52:24.300
Hold on, let me find her.

03:52:26.300 --> 03:52:27.300
Oh, I follow so many girls.

03:52:29.300 --> 03:52:30.300
Oh, Dr. Nova followed me back.

03:52:30.300 --> 03:52:31.300
That was kind of her.

03:52:32.300 --> 03:52:33.300
Hold on.

03:52:35.300 --> 03:52:37.300
Is it, like, the Any End Stream?

03:52:38.300 --> 03:52:39.300
Or...

03:52:40.300 --> 03:52:41.300
I don't know.

03:52:42.300 --> 03:52:43.300
I don't know.

03:52:44.300 --> 03:52:45.300
I don't know.

03:52:46.300 --> 03:52:47.300
I don't know.

03:52:48.300 --> 03:52:49.300
I don't know.

03:52:51.300 --> 03:52:52.300
I don't have the Discord account,

03:52:53.300 --> 03:52:54.300
because I don't know anything.

03:52:55.300 --> 03:52:56.300
She was showing me something.

03:52:57.300 --> 03:52:58.300
Oh, it's just her filming.

03:52:59.300 --> 03:53:00.300
Yeah.

03:53:14.300 --> 03:53:15.300
I don't know.

03:53:20.300 --> 03:53:21.300
Okay.

03:53:30.300 --> 03:53:31.300
I think it's okay.

03:53:34.300 --> 03:53:35.300
Okay, I think it's okay.

03:53:35.300 --> 03:53:36.300
I think it's just...

03:53:41.300 --> 03:53:42.300
Yeah.

03:53:42.300 --> 03:53:43.300
Okay, I think it's...

03:53:43.300 --> 03:53:44.300
All right.

03:53:46.300 --> 03:53:47.300
The Uji-Sans will...

03:53:47.300 --> 03:53:49.300
Oh, it looks like I'm moving on my health here.

03:53:49.300 --> 03:53:50.300
The Uji-Sans will...

03:53:54.300 --> 03:53:56.300
Gimli, I can hear you now.

03:53:56.300 --> 03:53:57.300
Shut the fuck up.

03:53:58.300 --> 03:54:00.300
There is not the time, darling.

03:54:03.300 --> 03:54:04.300
Okay.

03:54:05.300 --> 03:54:06.300
Phew, we barely made it.

03:54:06.300 --> 03:54:07.300
I'm starting to run out of time.

03:54:07.300 --> 03:54:08.300
I'm not trying.

03:54:09.300 --> 03:54:10.300
I'm going to bed.

03:54:10.300 --> 03:54:11.300
Oh, God, these are the hugger things.

03:54:12.300 --> 03:54:13.300
Sorry, I might have to get Gimli in a minute.

03:54:13.300 --> 03:54:14.300
She will not stop me on.

03:54:17.300 --> 03:54:18.300
But I know...

03:54:22.300 --> 03:54:23.300
He named your cat Gimli.

03:54:24.300 --> 03:54:25.300
Am I going to call my cat Gimli?

03:54:25.300 --> 03:54:26.300
So you're going to...

03:54:27.300 --> 03:54:28.300
You're going to fart and clap?

03:54:29.300 --> 03:54:30.300
Wait, no, that's not the same.

03:54:30.300 --> 03:54:32.300
I think the same is like...

03:54:32.300 --> 03:54:33.300
I'd rather...

03:54:34.300 --> 03:54:36.300
go number two in my hands and clap

03:54:36.300 --> 03:54:37.300
than do whatever...

03:54:37.300 --> 03:54:38.300
or something fun.

03:54:41.300 --> 03:54:42.300
It's a she, yes.

03:54:44.300 --> 03:54:45.300
She's got a bit of ginger on her,

03:54:45.300 --> 03:54:46.300
so I named her Gimli.

03:54:48.300 --> 03:54:49.300
I know, so for you.

03:54:51.300 --> 03:54:52.300
Ah, yes.

03:54:52.300 --> 03:54:53.300
The floor masters,

03:54:53.300 --> 03:54:55.300
or the masters, depending on you.

03:54:57.300 --> 03:54:59.300
Just kind of go in here

03:54:59.300 --> 03:55:00.300
and do something.

03:55:01.300 --> 03:55:02.300
I don't know what,

03:55:02.300 --> 03:55:03.300
but we're doing something anyway.

03:55:06.300 --> 03:55:07.300
Wait, what?

03:55:07.300 --> 03:55:09.300
Is that supposed to go somewhere?

03:55:13.300 --> 03:55:14.300
Wait,

03:55:14.300 --> 03:55:15.300
have I gone too far ahead?

03:55:18.300 --> 03:55:19.300
I think I have.

03:55:25.300 --> 03:55:26.300
Wait, have I gone too far ahead?

03:55:28.300 --> 03:55:29.300
Have I done wrong?

03:55:32.300 --> 03:55:34.300
I wouldn't mind getting a wee health bar.

03:55:38.300 --> 03:55:40.300
I'm getting a wee cheeky heart.

03:55:41.300 --> 03:55:42.300
I called my cat, baby.

03:55:43.300 --> 03:55:44.300
Unlock the door.

03:55:45.300 --> 03:55:46.300
I can't.

03:55:46.300 --> 03:55:47.300
Oh, my God!

03:55:50.300 --> 03:55:51.300
I'm not supposed to get killed for that.

03:55:56.300 --> 03:55:57.300
Oh, no.

03:55:57.300 --> 03:55:58.300
Close one.

03:56:05.300 --> 03:56:07.300
Oh, I know, I know.

03:56:07.300 --> 03:56:08.300
I comprehend, I comprehend.

03:56:10.300 --> 03:56:11.300
No, don't.

03:56:11.300 --> 03:56:12.300
Wait, what is this?

03:56:12.300 --> 03:56:13.300
I don't know.

03:56:14.300 --> 03:56:15.300
Oh, I need a zigzag.

03:56:16.300 --> 03:56:17.300
Okay, I understand, I understand.

03:56:17.300 --> 03:56:18.300
Sorry, it took me a...

03:56:19.300 --> 03:56:20.300
a momento.

03:56:20.300 --> 03:56:21.300
Right, if I do one there...

03:56:23.300 --> 03:56:25.300
One, two, three, four, five.

03:56:25.300 --> 03:56:27.300
Five, one, two, three, four, five.

03:56:27.300 --> 03:56:29.300
Okay, up there and up there.

03:56:29.300 --> 03:56:30.300
Right, okay, okay, okay.

03:56:30.300 --> 03:56:31.300
Sorry, sorry.

03:56:31.300 --> 03:56:32.300
It just takes me...

03:56:32.300 --> 03:56:34.300
It takes me a moment to catch on.

03:56:34.300 --> 03:56:35.300
It takes me a wee moment.

03:56:35.300 --> 03:56:36.300
It's alright, it's alright, though.

03:56:37.300 --> 03:56:38.300
It's alright.

03:56:38.300 --> 03:56:39.300
It's alright.

03:56:39.300 --> 03:56:40.300
We're here for doing it.

03:56:40.300 --> 03:56:41.300
I don't need anybody.

03:56:41.300 --> 03:56:42.300
I don't need anybody.

03:56:42.300 --> 03:56:43.300
Um...

03:56:44.300 --> 03:56:47.300
I was actually thinking of getting...

03:56:49.300 --> 03:56:50.300
What's the game called?

03:56:50.300 --> 03:56:52.300
Ah, that's exactly what I needed.

03:56:52.300 --> 03:56:54.300
I was actually thinking of getting...

03:56:56.300 --> 03:56:58.300
the buckshot roulette highlighted

03:56:58.300 --> 03:56:59.300
just to show how dumb I am,

03:56:59.300 --> 03:57:01.300
but like in a humorous way,

03:57:01.300 --> 03:57:02.300
not like a...

03:57:02.300 --> 03:57:03.300
you know, like pity party,

03:57:03.300 --> 03:57:06.300
oh my gosh, who's brainless type of way.

03:57:06.300 --> 03:57:08.300
And then I need to be small down here.

03:57:10.300 --> 03:57:11.300
Okay, that looks correct.

03:57:11.300 --> 03:57:13.300
It looks like I need to be small now.

03:57:15.300 --> 03:57:16.300
And what is down here?

03:57:16.300 --> 03:57:18.300
I'm curious.

03:57:21.300 --> 03:57:23.300
If there's anything at all.

03:57:24.300 --> 03:57:26.300
Amy just went live with brainwashing.

03:57:29.300 --> 03:57:31.300
She has already got a warning,

03:57:31.300 --> 03:57:33.300
so I'm nervous for that stream,

03:57:33.300 --> 03:57:34.300
but hey, huh?

03:57:34.300 --> 03:57:35.300
We're all adults here.

03:57:37.300 --> 03:57:38.300
How'd I get up?

03:57:38.300 --> 03:57:39.300
I can't use the stairs,

03:57:39.300 --> 03:57:40.300
so I'll have to go all the way back

03:57:40.300 --> 03:57:42.300
and shrink down an income.

03:57:45.300 --> 03:57:46.300
I am getting very low health

03:57:46.300 --> 03:57:48.300
and I don't like it,

03:57:48.300 --> 03:57:49.300
and the game is currently refusing

03:57:49.300 --> 03:57:51.300
to spawn one heart for me.

03:57:51.300 --> 03:57:52.300
I do have a theory.

03:57:56.300 --> 03:57:58.300
Yeah, I don't really need money right now.

03:57:58.300 --> 03:57:59.300
I need a heart.

03:57:59.300 --> 03:58:01.300
The game already needs a heart.

03:58:02.300 --> 03:58:04.300
She's just following my misexample.

03:58:05.300 --> 03:58:06.300
I just get so nervous.

03:58:06.300 --> 03:58:07.300
I'm like, oh my god,

03:58:07.300 --> 03:58:08.300
I wouldn't want them to jeopardize

03:58:08.300 --> 03:58:10.300
their income or anything like that,

03:58:10.300 --> 03:58:12.300
because YouTube makes up

03:58:12.300 --> 03:58:14.300
such a big chunk of income.

03:58:14.300 --> 03:58:16.300
As well as passive income,

03:58:18.300 --> 03:58:19.300
because I almost made it.

03:58:19.300 --> 03:58:20.300
I was going to go it,

03:58:20.300 --> 03:58:21.300
but I don't have enough health

03:58:21.300 --> 03:58:22.300
to be messing around.

03:58:23.300 --> 03:58:24.300
But yes, Amy is live

03:58:24.300 --> 03:58:25.300
for any pinpals

03:58:25.300 --> 03:58:27.300
who are wanting

03:58:27.300 --> 03:58:30.300
the tingly ASMR experience.

03:58:30.300 --> 03:58:32.300
Please do check it out.

03:58:32.300 --> 03:58:33.300
Um...

03:58:35.300 --> 03:58:36.300
Um...

03:58:36.300 --> 03:58:38.300
What happened from here?

03:58:39.300 --> 03:58:40.300
Um...

03:58:40.300 --> 03:58:42.300
I'm just a bit of an irritant, okay?

03:58:43.300 --> 03:58:44.300
What did those do?

03:58:50.300 --> 03:58:51.300
Right.

03:58:53.300 --> 03:58:54.300
Again, my question is,

03:58:54.300 --> 03:58:55.300
what did those do?

03:58:57.300 --> 03:58:58.300
I dropped a key

03:58:58.300 --> 03:59:00.300
that I can't get access to.

03:59:01.300 --> 03:59:02.300
Ray...

03:59:04.300 --> 03:59:05.300
Right, if I want to become big,

03:59:05.300 --> 03:59:07.300
I can take a shortcut this way.

03:59:08.300 --> 03:59:10.300
I am missing an item,

03:59:10.300 --> 03:59:12.300
and I've gone the wrong way.

03:59:16.300 --> 03:59:18.300
Okay, I've definitely missed an item,

03:59:18.300 --> 03:59:19.300
because...

03:59:25.300 --> 03:59:26.300
What was here?

03:59:27.300 --> 03:59:29.300
Again, I need an item.

03:59:29.300 --> 03:59:30.300
Right.

03:59:30.300 --> 03:59:31.300
There must be another way.

03:59:34.300 --> 03:59:35.300
Top ten times

03:59:35.300 --> 03:59:36.300
Pastrani

03:59:36.300 --> 03:59:37.300
shot herself with a shot

03:59:37.300 --> 03:59:39.300
that I didn't believe number four.

03:59:39.300 --> 03:59:40.300
What?!

03:59:44.300 --> 03:59:45.300
Would you prefer to be punned

03:59:45.300 --> 03:59:47.300
with Pastrami or something?

03:59:47.300 --> 03:59:49.300
Friggin' Azura's accent is so funny.

03:59:49.300 --> 03:59:50.300
She calls me Strani.

03:59:52.300 --> 03:59:53.300
And I'm like,

03:59:53.300 --> 03:59:55.300
are you calling me Minestrani Sue?

03:59:55.300 --> 03:59:57.300
But it's just the way she says it.

03:59:57.300 --> 03:59:58.300
Okay, this is exactly

03:59:58.300 --> 03:59:59.300
what I needed.

03:59:59.300 --> 04:00:00.300
This friggin' room right here.

04:00:00.300 --> 04:00:01.300
Give me the heart.

04:00:02.300 --> 04:00:03.300
She's a Gastroni,

04:00:03.300 --> 04:00:04.300
and I'm like...

04:00:05.300 --> 04:00:06.300
Oh my God, Azura.

04:00:07.300 --> 04:00:09.300
I literally sound like Minestrani Sue!

04:00:11.300 --> 04:00:12.300
That's very cute.

04:00:12.300 --> 04:00:13.300
I like it.

04:00:19.300 --> 04:00:20.300
That looks like Archery,

04:00:20.300 --> 04:00:22.300
if I've ever seen something like that.

04:00:22.300 --> 04:00:24.300
Yeah, and it gives you five in a...

04:00:26.300 --> 04:00:27.300
Okay.

04:00:27.300 --> 04:00:29.300
We will get the super secret item.

04:00:33.300 --> 04:00:35.300
Right, I'm just gonna take the HP damage

04:00:35.300 --> 04:00:37.300
because I know there's infinite heals.

04:00:39.300 --> 04:00:40.300
Oh!

04:00:40.300 --> 04:00:42.300
Do we have Invis frames when we spray?

04:00:43.300 --> 04:00:44.300
One of them is a rope.

04:00:47.300 --> 04:00:48.300
Yeah, fuck me.

04:00:49.300 --> 04:00:51.300
Damn right, give me that coin.

04:00:51.300 --> 04:00:53.300
Right, where is that electoral thing?

04:00:55.300 --> 04:00:56.300
Is it the red one?

04:01:00.300 --> 04:01:01.300
It is.

04:01:05.300 --> 04:01:06.300
See, you can get me to this.

04:01:06.300 --> 04:01:07.300
You got me before,

04:01:07.300 --> 04:01:08.300
but you'll never get me again.

04:01:12.300 --> 04:01:14.300
Azura's been absolutely killing it

04:01:14.300 --> 04:01:15.300
on the Star Jew.

04:01:15.300 --> 04:01:16.300
She is a dick.

04:01:16.300 --> 04:01:17.300
It's eight.

04:01:20.300 --> 04:01:21.300
What is this?

04:01:25.300 --> 04:01:26.300
Oh!

04:01:26.300 --> 04:01:27.300
True.

04:01:27.300 --> 04:01:29.300
Oh, I need to go on that platform.

04:01:30.300 --> 04:01:32.300
Oh, I need to do a little cheeky trickshot.

04:01:33.300 --> 04:01:34.300
Oh, I missed.

04:01:36.300 --> 04:01:37.300
Hey!

04:01:40.300 --> 04:01:41.300
And then...

04:01:45.300 --> 04:01:46.300
There we go.

04:01:46.300 --> 04:01:48.300
Both sides are open, that's why I like to...

04:01:52.300 --> 04:01:53.300
Yeah, see,

04:01:53.300 --> 04:01:55.300
imagine if you drop more hearts consistently.

04:01:55.300 --> 04:01:57.300
How easy would this game be?

04:01:57.300 --> 04:01:58.300
But no, no.

04:02:04.300 --> 04:02:05.300
If I push that,

04:02:06.300 --> 04:02:07.300
doesn't that block me?

04:02:11.300 --> 04:02:13.300
I'm a bit too scared to touch anything

04:02:13.300 --> 04:02:15.300
in this room...

04:02:15.300 --> 04:02:17.300
unless I'm going crazy.

04:02:18.300 --> 04:02:21.300
She said she has, like, two key arrows in it.

04:02:23.300 --> 04:02:24.300
That is...

04:02:25.300 --> 04:02:27.300
Am I going mental or is that just going to block me?

04:02:40.300 --> 04:02:41.300
However,

04:02:41.300 --> 04:02:43.300
I think I dropped down onto it instead

04:02:43.300 --> 04:02:45.300
because that doesn't seem right at all.

04:02:46.300 --> 04:02:48.300
I'm actually losing that...

04:02:49.300 --> 04:02:50.300
Game!

04:02:50.300 --> 04:02:52.300
You knew exactly what I was trying to achieve.

04:02:54.300 --> 04:02:55.300
Okay, let's go.

04:03:02.300 --> 04:03:04.300
Well, I assume this is going to turn them on.

04:03:05.300 --> 04:03:06.300
Hmm, gee Wilkers,

04:03:06.300 --> 04:03:09.300
I wonder if standing on these buttons in this room full of two enemies

04:03:09.300 --> 04:03:11.300
is going to activate enemies?

04:03:11.300 --> 04:03:12.300
Surely it's a mystery.

04:03:12.300 --> 04:03:13.300
Truly.

04:03:13.300 --> 04:03:14.300
Truly a mystery.

04:03:16.300 --> 04:03:17.300
I'm not stuck.

04:03:18.300 --> 04:03:19.300
Oh, I missed.

04:03:19.300 --> 04:03:20.300
Okay, now he's looking at me.

04:03:21.300 --> 04:03:22.300
Wah!

04:03:24.300 --> 04:03:25.300
I missed.

04:03:27.300 --> 04:03:28.300
Right in your eyeball, bruv.

04:03:31.300 --> 04:03:32.300
Ta-da!

04:03:37.300 --> 04:03:38.300
No, wait, you got it.

04:03:39.300 --> 04:03:40.300
Compass!

04:03:42.300 --> 04:03:43.300
The heart's in here.

04:03:43.300 --> 04:03:45.300
You know, there's ammo, though.

04:03:48.300 --> 04:03:50.300
I'm full ammo, I didn't even get it.

04:03:51.300 --> 04:03:53.300
It's correct, no push up.

04:03:54.300 --> 04:03:56.300
Pegasus boots across the gap, no push up.

04:03:58.300 --> 04:03:59.300
He gets trolling.

04:03:59.300 --> 04:04:02.300
I'm pretty sure I have to drop down and it's a troll.

04:04:04.300 --> 04:04:06.300
Nintendo are very trolly,

04:04:06.300 --> 04:04:09.300
but this does not seem correct at all.

04:04:09.300 --> 04:04:11.300
I think we dropped down.

04:04:11.300 --> 04:04:13.300
I want to say we dropped down because...

04:04:14.300 --> 04:04:16.300
Yeah, this doesn't look right.

04:04:16.300 --> 04:04:17.300
Push!

04:04:17.300 --> 04:04:18.300
Push!

04:04:18.300 --> 04:04:19.300
I can only push.

04:04:19.300 --> 04:04:20.300
I can only push again.

04:04:21.300 --> 04:04:22.300
And then I can only push again.

04:04:22.300 --> 04:04:23.300
I don't have a choice.

04:04:23.300 --> 04:04:25.300
Like, I can push that back.

04:04:25.300 --> 04:04:26.300
That doesn't do anything.

04:04:26.300 --> 04:04:27.300
Oh, push it up!

04:04:27.300 --> 04:04:29.300
Oh my god, I'm so sorry.

04:04:29.300 --> 04:04:31.300
I'm so sorry.

04:04:31.300 --> 04:04:32.300
I'm so...

04:04:33.300 --> 04:04:37.300
Like, if I can't see the solution, then it doesn't work.

04:04:37.300 --> 04:04:38.300
You know what I mean?

04:04:38.300 --> 04:04:39.300
I'm so sorry.

04:04:39.300 --> 04:04:42.300
The reason why you push it that way is so you can do them horizontal.

04:04:42.300 --> 04:04:43.300
I apologize.

04:04:43.300 --> 04:04:46.300
Literally never played this, so I can't offer any advice.

04:04:46.300 --> 04:04:49.300
Well, I'm pretty sure you probably called out though.

04:04:49.300 --> 04:04:51.300
I am so sorry.

04:04:51.300 --> 04:04:54.300
Oh my god, I must be painful watching me do anything.

04:04:56.300 --> 04:04:57.300
Okay, we have a key.

04:04:57.300 --> 04:04:58.300
Let's go grab it.

04:04:59.300 --> 04:05:01.300
Yeah, we're just going to go back down again.

04:05:01.300 --> 04:05:03.300
You're so adorable.

04:05:03.300 --> 04:05:04.300
Isn't it not frustrating though?

04:05:04.300 --> 04:05:07.300
I feel like it'd be frustrating watching someone being like,

04:05:07.300 --> 04:05:08.300
No, that's impossible.

04:05:08.300 --> 04:05:10.300
And the solution is literally right there.

04:05:11.300 --> 04:05:12.300
I feel like...

04:05:17.300 --> 04:05:19.300
I get it, I get it.

04:05:19.300 --> 04:05:22.300
Right, we finally have the second key, so we can just come up here

04:05:22.300 --> 04:05:24.300
and go straight into the...

04:05:24.300 --> 04:05:26.300
We would watch you...

04:05:26.300 --> 04:05:27.300
Oh, this reset.

04:05:27.300 --> 04:05:29.300
Oh, but I didn't reset those guys.

04:05:30.300 --> 04:05:32.300
Watch paint dry.

04:05:33.300 --> 04:05:34.300
Right.

04:05:34.300 --> 04:05:36.300
Let's just do this.

04:05:36.300 --> 04:05:37.300
Steady.

04:05:37.300 --> 04:05:38.300
Easy. Steady.

04:05:38.300 --> 04:05:40.300
Whoa, you've never seen anyone move faster.

04:05:42.300 --> 04:05:44.300
Are these going to vibrate?

04:05:44.300 --> 04:05:45.300
No.

04:05:46.300 --> 04:05:47.300
Whoa.

04:05:48.300 --> 04:05:49.300
Naughty.

04:05:50.300 --> 04:05:52.300
Oh wait, that's like the enemies in Isaac as well.

04:05:53.300 --> 04:05:56.300
He wasn't kidding when you said this game was inspired by it.

04:05:57.300 --> 04:05:58.300
Oh, fight room, fight room.

04:06:02.300 --> 04:06:05.300
It always scares other way, Link.

04:06:05.300 --> 04:06:06.300
Jeez.

04:06:10.300 --> 04:06:12.300
Okay, he needs to attack,

04:06:12.300 --> 04:06:14.300
and then I can wallop his chest.

04:06:15.300 --> 04:06:16.300
Wallop.

04:06:17.300 --> 04:06:18.300
Wallop.

04:06:19.300 --> 04:06:20.300
Wallop.

04:06:20.300 --> 04:06:21.300
Oh, I missed.

04:06:25.300 --> 04:06:26.300
Ah, there we go.

04:06:26.300 --> 04:06:28.300
Take yourself out, mate, you suck.

04:06:28.300 --> 04:06:32.300
Oh, we're already halfway through the dungeon, so just unlock the portal.

04:06:33.300 --> 04:06:34.300
Okay, yeah.

04:06:35.300 --> 04:06:39.300
Just a reminder to anyone that wants to watch ASMR,

04:06:39.300 --> 04:06:44.300
Amy Bezu is live, her link is in the description down below.

04:06:45.300 --> 04:06:47.300
Everyone's link is actually in my description.

04:06:47.300 --> 04:06:50.300
Go subscribe to everyone, and go watch their shorts.

04:06:50.300 --> 04:06:53.300
I spend money on their shorts, so please watch them.

04:06:53.300 --> 04:06:55.300
Please watch them, please help the girls.

04:06:56.300 --> 04:07:00.300
Actually, big news that I completely forgot to mention,

04:07:00.300 --> 04:07:04.300
Sheeby is going balls to the wall.

04:07:05.300 --> 04:07:07.300
She's full-time now, I feel her.

04:07:08.300 --> 04:07:11.300
She had a job, on every hand, and she's full-time now.

04:07:11.300 --> 04:07:12.300
Feels good now.

04:07:13.300 --> 04:07:16.300
So definitely don't be afraid to sign up for the girls' picture-

04:07:16.300 --> 04:07:19.300
Oh, that's what I was saying before I interrupted myself.

04:07:21.300 --> 04:07:22.300
Because someone-

04:07:22.300 --> 04:07:23.300
Ah, piss!

04:07:23.300 --> 04:07:24.300
My rupees are full.

04:07:27.300 --> 04:07:32.300
I didn't see a bag at that shot to increase my rupees.

04:07:34.300 --> 04:07:36.300
Yeah, she quit, she's now full-time.

04:07:36.300 --> 04:07:37.300
Yeah.

04:07:40.300 --> 04:07:43.300
Oh, that's just how I progressed.

04:07:45.300 --> 04:07:46.300
Yeah, she's full-time.

04:07:46.300 --> 04:07:48.300
Definitely don't be afraid to support the girls I'm pretty on.

04:07:48.300 --> 04:07:52.300
As I was saying, when I was mentioning that the game is free,

04:07:57.300 --> 04:07:59.300
I was talking about people being like,

04:07:59.300 --> 04:08:03.300
I only have five dollars to support.

04:08:03.300 --> 04:08:05.300
I feel so bad it's not enough.

04:08:07.300 --> 04:08:11.300
So, what's the word?

04:08:12.300 --> 04:08:14.300
It comes together.

04:08:16.300 --> 04:08:20.300
So you give five bucks, and then someone with your mentality gives five bucks,

04:08:20.300 --> 04:08:22.300
and then someone goes on and on and on.

04:08:22.300 --> 04:08:24.300
And that money adds up over time.

04:08:25.300 --> 04:08:26.300
It's kind of like-

04:08:26.300 --> 04:08:29.300
I don't know if you've ever heard of the OF Rhetoric where it's like,

04:08:29.300 --> 04:08:34.300
Oh, you sell your do-do-do-do for pennies type thing.

04:08:34.300 --> 04:08:36.300
But it adds up, though.

04:08:36.300 --> 04:08:39.300
You don't need to charge 70 or four.

04:08:39.300 --> 04:08:41.300
It's just not needed.

04:08:43.300 --> 04:08:45.300
I'm going to get an exact-

04:08:45.300 --> 04:08:46.300
I'm going to get-

04:08:46.300 --> 04:08:48.300
Please let me out, jeez.

04:08:49.300 --> 04:08:51.300
Wait, where'd I go with Keto?

04:08:52.300 --> 04:08:54.300
But it all adds up and it adds to their income,

04:08:54.300 --> 04:08:56.300
and it's stable income as well.

04:08:56.300 --> 04:08:58.300
As long as I have told the girls,

04:08:58.300 --> 04:09:00.300
I've been very serious with them.

04:09:00.300 --> 04:09:02.300
Am I going to get-

04:09:02.300 --> 04:09:03.300
Am I going to get touched?

04:09:03.300 --> 04:09:05.300
I've been not in the business.

04:09:06.300 --> 04:09:11.300
I have told them, like, it's of your utmost importance to give me these audios in time,

04:09:11.300 --> 04:09:13.300
because if we have to pause your Patreon income,

04:09:13.300 --> 04:09:16.300
then it's probably you're gonna be-

04:09:16.300 --> 04:09:18.300
There's no point in picking up rupees.

04:09:18.300 --> 04:09:21.300
Of course I get a red and two blues,

04:09:21.300 --> 04:09:24.300
literally 30 rupees in one pop when I'm like full.

04:09:25.300 --> 04:09:26.300
What are these guys?

04:09:26.300 --> 04:09:27.300
How do I hurt them?

04:09:27.300 --> 04:09:29.300
I'll just spam them in the corner.

04:09:29.300 --> 04:09:31.300
Money compounds, yes, basically.

04:09:31.300 --> 04:09:32.300
Can you come here?

04:09:33.300 --> 04:09:35.300
Is that four hits, jeez.

04:09:36.300 --> 04:09:39.300
Yeah, yeah, of course I get tons of money now.

04:09:39.300 --> 04:09:41.300
In game.

04:09:41.300 --> 04:09:43.300
Wah!

04:09:46.300 --> 04:09:48.300
Nah, Sam's just skipping.

04:09:48.300 --> 04:09:50.300
If you're not coming towards me, I'm skipping.

04:09:50.300 --> 04:09:52.300
Ah, piss, left or right.

04:09:53.300 --> 04:09:54.300
Left or right.

04:09:54.300 --> 04:09:56.300
Whoever types left or right, I'll do your first-

04:09:56.300 --> 04:09:58.300
Do your first saying.

04:09:58.300 --> 04:10:00.300
Don't blow it yourself or not, then eat and come on through.

04:10:00.300 --> 04:10:02.300
Don't be meanly, literally.

04:10:02.300 --> 04:10:04.300
Alright, first one said left.

04:10:12.300 --> 04:10:14.300
Mods, execute that man.

04:10:15.300 --> 04:10:17.300
Left or right.

04:10:17.300 --> 04:10:19.300
Left or right.

04:10:22.300 --> 04:10:23.300
Left or right.

04:10:23.300 --> 04:10:25.300
No, you know what?

04:10:25.300 --> 04:10:26.300
You know what?

04:10:26.300 --> 04:10:27.300
I'll do it myself.

04:10:27.300 --> 04:10:28.300
I'm gonna time you out,

04:10:28.300 --> 04:10:29.300
for giving me the wrong say-

04:10:29.300 --> 04:10:31.300
I'm not even kidding, I'm timing you out,

04:10:31.300 --> 04:10:33.300
because you gave me the wrong say to go on.

04:10:33.300 --> 04:10:36.300
You will be timed out for a whole,

04:10:36.300 --> 04:10:38.300
a whole minute.

04:10:38.300 --> 04:10:41.300
For your, your dissatisfaction.

04:10:41.300 --> 04:10:43.300
Where are you?

04:10:43.300 --> 04:10:44.300
No!

04:10:44.300 --> 04:10:46.300
Where is it?

04:10:46.300 --> 04:10:48.300
Wait, I need to time them out.

04:10:48.300 --> 04:10:49.300
I need to time them out.

04:10:49.300 --> 04:10:51.300
Put user in time out.

04:10:51.300 --> 04:10:52.300
Who was it?

04:10:52.300 --> 04:10:54.300
Right, put user in time out.

04:10:54.300 --> 04:10:57.300
For ten seconds, confirm.

04:10:57.300 --> 04:11:00.300
There, you've been timed out for ten seconds.

04:11:00.300 --> 04:11:02.300
Take that time out.

04:11:02.300 --> 04:11:04.300
Your insolence towards the cause

04:11:04.300 --> 04:11:06.300
will not be forgotten.

04:11:07.300 --> 04:11:09.300
Don't ever cook again.

04:11:09.300 --> 04:11:10.300
Teasing you.

04:11:10.300 --> 04:11:11.300
So cruel.

04:11:11.300 --> 04:11:12.300
One whole minute of no-

04:11:12.300 --> 04:11:14.300
No, I said ten seconds.

04:11:14.300 --> 04:11:15.300
I said ten seconds.

04:11:15.300 --> 04:11:17.300
Is he back?

04:11:17.300 --> 04:11:18.300
I'm gonna start panicking,

04:11:18.300 --> 04:11:20.300
if a mod actually did ban you for real though.

04:11:20.300 --> 04:11:22.300
Mods, whenever I say ban this man,

04:11:22.300 --> 04:11:24.300
I mean in humorous way.

04:11:24.300 --> 04:11:27.300
Where the heck is the dungeon thing?

04:11:27.300 --> 04:11:28.300
Based AF.

04:11:28.300 --> 04:11:29.300
Oh no, there you are.

04:11:29.300 --> 04:11:30.300
Guys, it hurts.

04:11:30.300 --> 04:11:32.300
Yeah, okay, he's back, he's back.

04:11:32.300 --> 04:11:35.300
Right, where was the dungeon entrance?

04:11:35.300 --> 04:11:38.300
I actually don't recall seeing the dungeon entrance.

04:11:38.300 --> 04:11:41.300
Is it back this way?

04:11:41.300 --> 04:11:43.300
Oh, they're dancing.

04:11:43.300 --> 04:11:44.300
Oh, it must be this way.

04:11:44.300 --> 04:11:46.300
Yeah, surely, surely.

04:11:51.300 --> 04:11:52.300
Check them out.

04:11:52.300 --> 04:11:54.300
Personal attention.

04:11:54.300 --> 04:11:55.300
Refling.

04:11:55.300 --> 04:11:57.300
This should have been me.

04:11:57.300 --> 04:11:58.300
No, it shouldn't,

04:11:58.300 --> 04:12:00.300
because you get timed out for doing that.

04:12:00.300 --> 04:12:02.300
Wait, I'm gonna do it.

04:12:02.300 --> 04:12:03.300
The chest spawns there,

04:12:03.300 --> 04:12:05.300
not the statue has to go there.

04:12:05.300 --> 04:12:07.300
Me making my thingy.

04:12:07.300 --> 04:12:08.300
Doomsdaydan,

04:12:08.300 --> 04:12:09.300
what if I wanna pay for it though?

04:12:09.300 --> 04:12:11.300
I never read out your name.

04:12:11.300 --> 04:12:14.300
God, it must be really weird

04:12:14.300 --> 04:12:16.300
when I don't read out your name when you don't know,

04:12:16.300 --> 04:12:18.300
and then 15 minutes later,

04:12:18.300 --> 04:12:20.300
I'm like, oh my god,

04:12:21.300 --> 04:12:22.300
Oh my god, Duly Lover,

04:12:22.300 --> 04:12:23.300
thank you so much,

04:12:23.300 --> 04:12:25.300
because I keep forgetting.

04:12:30.300 --> 04:12:32.300
I wouldn't mind getting a full heal.

04:12:32.300 --> 04:12:34.300
Do you have hearts?

04:12:34.300 --> 04:12:36.300
Yeah, that's what I like to see.

04:12:36.300 --> 04:12:37.300
That's what I like to see,

04:12:37.300 --> 04:12:38.300
a video game that's stocked up.

04:12:38.300 --> 04:12:40.300
Right, we're ready.

04:12:41.300 --> 04:12:43.300
How long are you going today?

04:12:43.300 --> 04:12:46.300
We have T-minus less than two hours,

04:12:46.300 --> 04:12:49.300
and then we will continue

04:12:49.300 --> 04:12:51.300
our Zelda shenanigans tomorrow.

04:12:55.300 --> 04:12:56.300
I don't feel that.

04:12:56.300 --> 04:12:58.300
I don't feel everything, honestly.

04:13:12.300 --> 04:13:15.300
Shoot his hands with an arrow?

04:13:15.300 --> 04:13:16.300
That looks correct,

04:13:16.300 --> 04:13:18.300
so let's do that.

04:13:18.300 --> 04:13:20.300
Oh, okay, let's not do that.

04:13:20.300 --> 04:13:23.300
Oh, okay, let's just completely miss.

04:13:29.300 --> 04:13:31.300
Ah, let me go, let me go.

04:13:31.300 --> 04:13:33.300
I'm just a tiny boy from the pool.

04:13:33.300 --> 04:13:35.300
Whoa, he took so much health.

04:13:35.300 --> 04:13:38.300
That is an insane amount of health he just took.

04:13:38.300 --> 04:13:40.300
Am I supposed to have more health by this?

04:13:40.300 --> 04:13:42.300
I think I might need to do more side quests

04:13:42.300 --> 04:13:43.300
than after this.

04:13:43.300 --> 04:13:46.300
He took so much health in that.

04:13:46.300 --> 04:13:48.300
Oh my god, oh my god.

04:13:49.300 --> 04:13:51.300
He's got a little thing on his nose.

04:13:51.300 --> 04:13:53.300
Oh god, what happens in here?

04:13:58.300 --> 04:14:00.300
Oh, okay, we did it, we did it.

04:14:00.300 --> 04:14:01.300
We're being extracted.

04:14:01.300 --> 04:14:02.300
Any extractors?

04:14:02.300 --> 04:14:04.300
Me, me, I'm being extracted.

04:14:06.300 --> 04:14:09.300
Why did you take so much health though?

04:14:10.300 --> 04:14:11.300
Oh.

04:14:14.300 --> 04:14:17.300
Can you drop a heart maybe instead of arrows?

04:14:17.300 --> 04:14:18.300
That'd be great.

04:14:25.300 --> 04:14:27.300
I'm totally not strawwetting right now.

04:14:27.300 --> 04:14:29.300
I'm getting a bit nervous.

04:14:29.300 --> 04:14:32.300
Oh, what, there?

04:14:32.300 --> 04:14:34.300
It's not that one, it has to be...

04:14:34.300 --> 04:14:36.300
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

04:14:37.300 --> 04:14:38.300
I can't do any harder.

04:14:38.300 --> 04:14:39.300
I can't do any harder.

04:14:39.300 --> 04:14:40.300
Alright, again, extracted.

04:14:40.300 --> 04:14:42.300
It's fine, it's fine, it's fine, it's fine, it's fine.

04:14:42.300 --> 04:14:44.300
We're gonna do it, we're gonna do it.

04:14:44.300 --> 04:14:45.300
What's that?

04:14:45.300 --> 04:14:46.300
I'm low health.

04:14:46.300 --> 04:14:48.300
It's fine though.

04:14:48.300 --> 04:14:49.300
Ow!

04:14:49.300 --> 04:14:51.300
Alright, I said we're dropping the fairy.

04:14:51.300 --> 04:14:52.300
Bring the fairy in.

04:14:52.300 --> 04:14:54.300
Ring the guards, ring the guards.

04:14:54.300 --> 04:14:56.300
The guards have been rang.

04:14:59.300 --> 04:15:01.300
Oh my god, I'm like spamming so hard when I do that.

04:15:01.300 --> 04:15:03.300
I'm not even kidding.

04:15:04.300 --> 04:15:05.300
Can we do it?

04:15:05.300 --> 04:15:06.300
Can we do it?

04:15:06.300 --> 04:15:08.300
Can we do it in this perfect three or are we gonna have to do it again?

04:15:08.300 --> 04:15:10.300
Because I don't have any more heals.

04:15:10.300 --> 04:15:12.300
I don't have any more heals, bro.

04:15:12.300 --> 04:15:13.300
Wait!

04:15:13.300 --> 04:15:14.300
What are you doing?

04:15:14.300 --> 04:15:16.300
Link!

04:15:16.300 --> 04:15:18.300
Link, you're stressing me out.

04:15:18.300 --> 04:15:19.300
We're under a timer here.

04:15:19.300 --> 04:15:21.300
This guy doesn't stay down forever.

04:15:21.300 --> 04:15:23.300
Sorry, sorry.

04:15:23.300 --> 04:15:25.300
Ugh.

04:15:25.300 --> 04:15:27.300
No!

04:15:27.300 --> 04:15:29.300
Ugh.

04:15:29.300 --> 04:15:31.300
Oh, we're gonna get extracted before we even...

04:15:31.300 --> 04:15:33.300
Done a lick of damage!

04:15:33.300 --> 04:15:34.300
No!

04:15:34.300 --> 04:15:36.300
This is why I don't gamble!

04:15:37.300 --> 04:15:39.300
This is why I don't gamble!

04:15:39.300 --> 04:15:41.300
Oh, we did it.

04:15:41.300 --> 04:15:43.300
Oh, we did it.

04:15:43.300 --> 04:15:45.300
Don't gamble, home kids.

04:15:46.300 --> 04:15:48.300
This is why we don't gamble.

04:15:49.300 --> 04:15:52.300
Let's go free in a row.

04:15:52.300 --> 04:15:54.300
And a healthup.

04:15:54.300 --> 04:15:56.300
I don't know why I just turned Russian there.

04:15:56.300 --> 04:15:57.300
A healthup.

04:15:57.300 --> 04:15:58.300
Okay, we got healed up.

04:15:58.300 --> 04:16:00.300
Now we go upstairs.

04:16:01.300 --> 04:16:05.300
Oh my god, it's Gami's colourful family.

04:16:05.300 --> 04:16:06.300
Hello.

04:16:06.300 --> 04:16:07.300
Check.

04:16:07.300 --> 04:16:10.300
We are the tribe of the winds.

04:16:10.300 --> 04:16:13.300
Long have we lived with the winds.

04:16:13.300 --> 04:16:14.300
We have mastered them.

04:16:14.300 --> 04:16:18.300
Now we join them together with the great winds at our backs.

04:16:18.300 --> 04:16:19.300
We head for the skies.

04:16:19.300 --> 04:16:24.300
Those who come seeking our power must play the note Zafa teachers.

04:16:24.300 --> 04:16:26.300
Zafa teachers.

04:16:26.300 --> 04:16:29.300
May they lead you onward to the power that you seek.

04:16:30.300 --> 04:16:31.300
Aw.

04:16:31.300 --> 04:16:34.300
You got the ocarina of the winds.

04:16:34.300 --> 04:16:38.300
North, south, east and west, they're all just a breath away.

04:16:40.300 --> 04:16:43.300
I do believe this is where the tribe of the winds once lived.

04:16:43.300 --> 04:16:44.300
Hmm.

04:16:44.300 --> 04:16:48.300
So they've left for the heavens and taken their element with them.

04:16:48.300 --> 04:16:53.300
It looks like the wind element is beyond our reach for the time being.

04:16:53.300 --> 04:16:55.300
We have no choice but to press on.

04:16:55.300 --> 04:16:57.300
Let's get out of here.

04:16:58.300 --> 04:17:02.300
So we did all of that for fucking nothing.

04:17:02.300 --> 04:17:06.300
The element was not here, but at least we now have a clue to its whereabouts.

04:17:06.300 --> 04:17:09.300
You must use the ocarina of wind to open a new path.

04:17:09.300 --> 04:17:12.300
Well, there's no point in standing around.

04:17:12.300 --> 04:17:14.300
Get that last element.

04:17:14.300 --> 04:17:16.300
Last element.

04:17:16.300 --> 04:17:18.300
We only have two.

04:17:28.300 --> 04:17:30.300
Are we?

04:17:33.300 --> 04:17:36.300
Um, are we supposed to go to the graveyard now?

04:17:39.300 --> 04:17:40.300
Yes.

04:17:42.300 --> 04:17:46.300
Ah, so that mysterious mark we've been seeing is the crest wind.

04:17:46.300 --> 04:17:50.300
If you play the ocarina of wind, Zafa comes to pick you up and fly away.

04:17:50.300 --> 04:17:54.300
That means we can have Zafa carry us to any other wind crest that we've seen.

04:17:55.300 --> 04:17:57.300
Are you following me, Link?

04:17:57.300 --> 04:17:59.300
Don't hurt your brain thinking about it.

04:17:59.300 --> 04:18:02.300
Just give it a try and you'll see what I'm talking about.

04:18:05.300 --> 04:18:06.300
That's just the map from...

04:18:06.300 --> 04:18:08.300
That's just the map from a link to the past.

04:18:08.300 --> 04:18:10.300
Is that actually?

04:18:10.300 --> 04:18:12.300
Right, no?

04:18:15.300 --> 04:18:17.300
Do you wonder what's going on?

04:18:17.300 --> 04:18:19.300
I wonder what's going on too.

04:18:20.300 --> 04:18:23.300
Uh, right.

04:18:23.300 --> 04:18:25.300
We never actually...

04:18:25.300 --> 04:18:27.300
Hello?

04:18:27.300 --> 04:18:28.300
Stamp, stamp.

04:18:28.300 --> 04:18:30.300
Even if we hire more people.

04:18:30.300 --> 04:18:31.300
Welcome.

04:18:31.300 --> 04:18:33.300
I'm selling issues of a helpful, adventurous guide.

04:18:33.300 --> 04:18:36.300
It's called The Swordsman's News, and it's full of device right now.

04:18:36.300 --> 04:18:37.300
You can buy the latest issue.

04:18:37.300 --> 04:18:38.300
It's only 200.

04:18:38.300 --> 04:18:39.300
200?

04:18:39.300 --> 04:18:42.300
That's extortionate for a piece of paper and a bit of ink, mate.

04:18:42.300 --> 04:18:46.300
I'm not lying, but that's a bit much, don't you think?

04:18:46.300 --> 04:18:48.300
I'm going to see if we can get a bigger...

04:18:50.300 --> 04:18:53.300
A bigger money pouch.

04:18:56.300 --> 04:18:58.300
Use the Ocarina to fly to the lake.

04:19:00.300 --> 04:19:01.300
Ice temple.

04:19:01.300 --> 04:19:02.300
Oh, you're right.

04:19:02.300 --> 04:19:03.300
Ice temple.

04:19:05.300 --> 04:19:06.300
Wow.

04:19:07.300 --> 04:19:08.300
Money, money, money.

04:19:08.300 --> 04:19:09.300
Oh, wonderful.

04:19:09.300 --> 04:19:10.300
They fit.

04:19:10.300 --> 04:19:11.300
I'm so happy.

04:19:17.300 --> 04:19:21.300
Oh, I can just keep using these guys over and over again.

04:19:23.300 --> 04:19:24.300
I've got two red.

04:19:24.300 --> 04:19:26.300
I assume red is like a major math update.

04:19:29.300 --> 04:19:31.300
Okay, money pouch.

04:19:32.300 --> 04:19:33.300
Total.

04:19:33.300 --> 04:19:35.300
It's a golden total.

04:19:35.300 --> 04:19:36.300
I like totals.

04:19:37.300 --> 04:19:39.300
Gears, the sh...

04:19:39.300 --> 04:19:41.300
Oh, the arcade's open.

04:19:41.300 --> 04:19:42.300
What happened to the arcade?

04:19:46.300 --> 04:19:47.300
Netto?

04:19:48.300 --> 04:19:51.300
I can buy a bigger quiver?

04:19:52.300 --> 04:19:53.300
I don't know.

04:19:54.300 --> 04:19:56.300
I'll buy the boomerang.

04:19:57.300 --> 04:20:01.300
That boomerang is not a bargain, but I'll take it since I need it.

04:20:01.300 --> 04:20:02.300
Yeah, you're...

04:20:03.300 --> 04:20:05.300
Well, you're a big spender.

04:20:05.300 --> 04:20:08.300
Wait, does the boomerang get replaced by a money pouch?

04:20:10.300 --> 04:20:12.300
How much is the money pouch?

04:20:13.300 --> 04:20:14.300
600?

04:20:15.300 --> 04:20:16.300
Eh?

04:20:19.300 --> 04:20:20.300
What about you?

04:20:21.300 --> 04:20:23.300
I don't have this kind of money.

04:20:23.300 --> 04:20:25.300
I can't even hold it on my persons.

04:20:26.300 --> 04:20:28.300
Jeez, you're extortionate, mate.

04:20:28.300 --> 04:20:29.300
I'm a child.

04:20:30.300 --> 04:20:32.300
Surely I get some discount.

04:20:33.300 --> 04:20:35.300
I want to play games too.

04:20:35.300 --> 04:20:36.300
What's in here?

04:20:37.300 --> 04:20:38.300
What do you do?

04:20:38.300 --> 04:20:39.300
Ah, he's finally open.

04:20:39.300 --> 04:20:41.300
I can't wait to get cracking.

04:20:41.300 --> 04:20:42.300
I don't know what this is.

04:20:42.300 --> 04:20:44.300
That's like four languages.

04:20:44.300 --> 04:20:45.300
What are these inflation rates?

04:20:45.300 --> 04:20:47.300
Yeah, real child labor.

04:20:47.300 --> 04:20:48.300
Speak.

04:20:48.300 --> 04:20:49.300
Oh no, a customer.

04:20:49.300 --> 04:20:51.300
Why did I even start a treasure game shop anyway?

04:20:51.300 --> 04:20:52.300
Alright then.

04:20:52.300 --> 04:20:55.300
Well, welcome to the fascinating world of treasure, blah blah blah.

04:20:55.300 --> 04:20:58.300
In this wonderland, you can test your luck and win big bucks, maybe.

04:20:58.300 --> 04:21:00.300
I don't really recommend it myself, however.

04:21:00.300 --> 04:21:01.300
It's your wallet.

04:21:01.300 --> 04:21:03.300
It's 10 rupees for a try.

04:21:03.300 --> 04:21:05.300
I don't even have that money.

04:21:06.300 --> 04:21:08.300
I fell over because I don't have the money.

04:21:08.300 --> 04:21:09.300
Oh, good, good.

04:21:09.300 --> 04:21:10.300
It really is your lucky day.

04:21:10.300 --> 04:21:11.300
You don't have enough rupees.

04:21:11.300 --> 04:21:14.300
I'm telling you, this gambling nonsense is no good.

04:21:14.300 --> 04:21:16.300
You're better off without it.

04:21:16.300 --> 04:21:20.300
Wait, Nintendo kind of pitching the masses, huh?

04:21:20.300 --> 04:21:21.300
Right.

04:21:23.300 --> 04:21:27.300
Can I learn a new move because I can do this?

04:21:28.300 --> 04:21:30.300
Come again when you can jump further than any other.

04:21:30.300 --> 04:21:31.300
Okay, my bad.

04:21:31.300 --> 04:21:33.300
It doesn't have 10 bucks, could you glad?

04:21:33.300 --> 04:21:38.300
If you aren't playing on a Game Boy, you can scam this game?

04:21:41.300 --> 04:21:44.300
Now, the implications of that just don't work.

04:21:47.300 --> 04:21:48.300
I don't...

04:21:48.300 --> 04:21:50.300
No, this isn't where I'm supposed to go.

04:21:51.300 --> 04:21:54.300
Even though I'm supposed to technically make my way to the air temple.

04:21:54.300 --> 04:21:55.300
Oh, goodness.

04:21:55.300 --> 04:21:56.300
Yay, okay, right.

04:21:56.300 --> 04:21:58.300
I'm not supposed to be here yet.

04:21:58.300 --> 04:22:02.300
We will now go top right, but not too top right.

04:22:02.300 --> 04:22:03.300
Like middle right.

04:22:03.300 --> 04:22:04.300
How about that?

04:22:04.300 --> 04:22:05.300
We do middle right.

04:22:05.300 --> 04:22:06.300
Deal.

04:22:06.300 --> 04:22:07.300
We now have Pegasus boots.

04:22:07.300 --> 04:22:08.300
What is that?

04:22:09.300 --> 04:22:13.300
I don't know what that changes over here if we have access to Pegasus boots though.

04:22:14.300 --> 04:22:17.300
Oh, I just fucking ruled them.

04:22:18.300 --> 04:22:19.300
Fucking hell.

04:22:19.300 --> 04:22:20.300
Fucking hell.

04:22:20.300 --> 04:22:22.300
There's too much going on here.

04:22:22.300 --> 04:22:23.300
I can't handle it.

04:22:23.300 --> 04:22:24.300
I'm getting ruled.

04:22:24.300 --> 04:22:25.300
I'm getting ruled.

04:22:25.300 --> 04:22:27.300
Jeez, would you perish already?

04:22:28.300 --> 04:22:30.300
Gosh, galley.

04:22:32.300 --> 04:22:34.300
Jeez, I'm getting absolutely obliterated.

04:22:34.300 --> 04:22:36.300
I think you can use a Steve Star.

04:22:36.300 --> 04:22:39.300
You can scan the game by saving and checking and loading and clicking right.

04:22:39.300 --> 04:22:41.300
Wow, I didn't know that.

04:22:43.300 --> 04:22:46.300
I feel like there's something I must have access to.

04:22:48.300 --> 04:22:49.300
This?

04:22:49.300 --> 04:22:50.300
Oh, this looks okay.

04:22:53.300 --> 04:22:55.300
Reach go a little to the right.

04:22:55.300 --> 04:22:56.300
Oh.

04:22:57.300 --> 04:22:58.300
Or not.

04:23:01.300 --> 04:23:03.300
Oh, a new fairy.

04:23:03.300 --> 04:23:04.300
Hello.

04:23:04.300 --> 04:23:05.300
Hello.

04:23:05.300 --> 04:23:06.300
I'm Link.

04:23:07.300 --> 04:23:10.300
And I'd like to link up with you, baby girl.

04:23:11.300 --> 04:23:12.300
Hi.

04:23:13.300 --> 04:23:14.300
Wow.

04:23:14.300 --> 04:23:16.300
Welcome to the adventure spring.

04:23:16.300 --> 04:23:18.300
I have need of many rupees.

04:23:18.300 --> 04:23:20.300
Please throw all of yours into the spring.

04:23:20.300 --> 04:23:21.300
Sure.

04:23:21.300 --> 04:23:22.300
All yours.

04:23:22.300 --> 04:23:23.300
I don't need it.

04:23:23.300 --> 04:23:24.300
Really?

04:23:24.300 --> 04:23:26.300
You know, I don't even have one rupee on my person.

04:23:26.300 --> 04:23:27.300
You know that.

04:23:27.300 --> 04:23:29.300
If you do this, you will have absolutely no rupees left, right?

04:23:29.300 --> 04:23:31.300
Will you really throw them all in?

04:23:31.300 --> 04:23:32.300
Yes.

04:23:32.300 --> 04:23:34.300
You are most kind.

04:23:34.300 --> 04:23:36.300
I do not really need your rupees,

04:23:36.300 --> 04:23:39.300
but I must reward such a kind adventure with some of my power.

04:23:40.300 --> 04:23:41.300
You got a big wallet.

04:23:44.300 --> 04:23:46.300
Complain and you shall receive.

04:23:46.300 --> 04:23:48.300
May light shine on your quest.

04:23:49.300 --> 04:23:51.300
May light shine on your quest.

04:23:51.300 --> 04:23:53.300
Complain and you shall receive.

04:23:53.300 --> 04:23:55.300
I got exactly what I wanted.

04:23:58.300 --> 04:24:00.300
Wallet upgrade.

04:24:00.300 --> 04:24:02.300
Don't mind if I do.

04:24:02.300 --> 04:24:04.300
Literally exactly what I was needing.

04:24:06.300 --> 04:24:07.300
Sorry.

04:24:07.300 --> 04:24:09.300
I'm going to have to get like Gimli in this room.

04:24:09.300 --> 04:24:11.300
Because she's going to absolutely hate shit.

04:24:13.300 --> 04:24:14.300
Sorry.

04:24:14.300 --> 04:24:16.300
I need to get rid of the plastic in the room, girl.

04:24:16.300 --> 04:24:18.300
Because she'll chew the plastic.

04:24:18.300 --> 04:24:20.300
Won't you get more?

04:24:25.300 --> 04:24:27.300
I can chew the room, Gimli.

04:24:28.300 --> 04:24:30.300
Then I'll put it in.

04:24:31.300 --> 04:24:33.300
No, there'll be inside by the money.

04:24:34.300 --> 04:24:36.300
I'll be coming right now.

04:24:36.300 --> 04:24:37.300
Sorry.

04:24:38.300 --> 04:24:39.300
Oh, and now I'll open the door

04:24:39.300 --> 04:24:40.300
all the time.

04:24:40.300 --> 04:24:42.300
She'll be interested when we're coming in.

04:24:43.300 --> 04:24:45.300
I'm getting out of here.

04:24:47.300 --> 04:24:48.300
Why are you here?

04:24:48.300 --> 04:24:49.300
I need to go.

04:24:51.300 --> 04:24:52.300
Come on.

04:24:52.300 --> 04:24:54.300
You need to push through the door.

04:24:55.300 --> 04:24:56.300
Oh, hold on.

04:24:56.300 --> 04:24:58.300
I'm going to open the back gate.

04:24:58.300 --> 04:25:00.300
Garden 4, I'll be back for a sec.

04:25:24.300 --> 04:25:25.300
Sorry.

04:25:54.300 --> 04:25:56.300
See these cats, man.

04:25:56.300 --> 04:25:58.300
See these cats.

04:26:00.300 --> 04:26:01.300
Oh.

04:26:01.300 --> 04:26:02.300
She's coming out of me.

04:26:02.300 --> 04:26:03.300
Oh, do you want out?

04:26:03.300 --> 04:26:04.300
No, do you want...

04:26:04.300 --> 04:26:05.300
What do you want?

04:26:05.300 --> 04:26:06.300
I've already fed you.

04:26:06.300 --> 04:26:08.300
Obviously she wants treats.

04:26:09.300 --> 04:26:12.300
So, I'm now reinforcing that behaviour

04:26:12.300 --> 04:26:14.300
for her to come me out and annoy me.

04:26:14.300 --> 04:26:15.300
So, she's not looking good.

04:26:15.300 --> 04:26:16.300
She's not looking good.

04:26:16.300 --> 04:26:17.300
She's not looking good.

04:26:17.300 --> 04:26:19.300
So, I'm now reinforcing that behaviour

04:26:19.300 --> 04:26:21.300
for her to come me out and annoy me.

04:26:21.300 --> 04:26:23.300
So, she's not looking good.

04:26:23.300 --> 04:26:24.300
She's not looking good.

04:26:24.300 --> 04:26:26.300
Do you want to do pin stones?

04:26:26.300 --> 04:26:27.300
No?

04:26:27.300 --> 04:26:28.300
Oh, wait a minute.

04:26:28.300 --> 04:26:30.300
We have the mitts.

04:26:30.300 --> 04:26:31.300
No, we can do this.

04:26:32.300 --> 04:26:33.300
Fuck.

04:26:38.300 --> 04:26:40.300
That's just the money.

04:26:41.300 --> 04:26:44.300
No, the game knows I'm too scared.

04:26:47.300 --> 04:26:48.300
Well, there you go.

04:26:48.300 --> 04:26:51.300
To keep out money for doing a wee bit of exploring.

04:26:52.300 --> 04:26:54.300
Stranny new.

04:26:54.300 --> 04:26:55.300
What?

04:26:55.300 --> 04:26:56.300
What does it do?

04:27:00.300 --> 04:27:03.300
Oh, she's going to start me on a hell of a lot more now.

04:27:03.300 --> 04:27:04.300
Oh, well.

04:27:05.300 --> 04:27:06.300
She...

04:27:06.300 --> 04:27:08.300
Honestly, you can spoil a cat.

04:27:08.300 --> 04:27:09.300
What's the worst of him?

04:27:09.300 --> 04:27:10.300
Is it me?

04:27:10.300 --> 04:27:11.300
I was a bit more...

04:27:11.300 --> 04:27:12.300
There's none of them.

04:27:12.300 --> 04:27:13.300
It's up or down.

04:27:13.300 --> 04:27:14.300
I think I may actually be up.

04:27:14.300 --> 04:27:15.300
You know what?

04:27:15.300 --> 04:27:16.300
This way to the lake.

04:27:16.300 --> 04:27:17.300
So, what's up?

04:27:18.300 --> 04:27:19.300
Shhh.

04:27:20.300 --> 04:27:22.300
Aw, I'm going the wrong way.

04:27:23.300 --> 04:27:26.300
Mmm, I may have gone the wrong way.

04:27:27.300 --> 04:27:29.300
I am going the wrong way.

04:27:29.300 --> 04:27:31.300
I'm going to have to go all the way on.

04:27:33.300 --> 04:27:35.300
Cats deserve all the treats.

04:27:36.300 --> 04:27:38.300
I didn't mean to spoil them.

04:27:38.300 --> 04:27:39.300
Weed gimmels.

04:27:39.300 --> 04:27:40.300
Or we go.

04:27:41.300 --> 04:27:43.300
My cat doesn't stop me at one.

04:27:43.300 --> 04:27:46.300
Literally, I don't know how much you could hear

04:27:46.300 --> 04:27:49.300
because I was away from the microphone and, like, standing at the door.

04:27:49.300 --> 04:27:51.300
I was like, right, come in then.

04:27:51.300 --> 04:27:52.300
Come in then, you win.

04:27:52.300 --> 04:27:53.300
Come in.

04:27:53.300 --> 04:27:55.300
And then she's looking at me like...

04:27:56.300 --> 04:27:57.300
I'm like...

04:27:58.300 --> 04:27:59.300
Bruv, you've literally won.

04:27:59.300 --> 04:28:00.300
Wait.

04:28:00.300 --> 04:28:01.300
No!

04:28:01.300 --> 04:28:03.300
I thought I unlocked the shortcut there.

04:28:03.300 --> 04:28:04.300
Oh, there it is.

04:28:04.300 --> 04:28:05.300
There it is.

04:28:05.300 --> 04:28:06.300
Okay, we're on the right track.

04:28:07.300 --> 04:28:09.300
That ace thing, if you noticed it.

04:28:09.300 --> 04:28:10.300
Whoa, whose house is this?

04:28:11.300 --> 04:28:13.300
Oh, Tiddly Wings.

04:28:13.300 --> 04:28:14.300
Let me dug here.

04:28:14.300 --> 04:28:16.300
Oh, how's it going, wee man?

04:28:16.300 --> 04:28:17.300
Rough, rough.

04:28:17.300 --> 04:28:18.300
Oh, great.

04:28:18.300 --> 04:28:19.300
Can I go talk to it?

04:28:19.300 --> 04:28:21.300
You're right there, mate.

04:28:21.300 --> 04:28:24.300
My master, Sokwell, has been coming home far too late to play with me.

04:28:24.300 --> 04:28:25.300
I'm so lonely.

04:28:25.300 --> 04:28:27.300
Okay, let's fuse these two.

04:28:29.300 --> 04:28:33.300
Guys, I'm still recovering from the time that I forgot what duration was left.

04:28:33.300 --> 04:28:34.300
My cat doesn't...

04:28:38.300 --> 04:28:40.300
Minish Village?

04:28:42.300 --> 04:28:43.300
No, not Minish Village.

04:28:45.300 --> 04:28:47.300
Thanks for that, Tiddly Wings.

04:28:47.300 --> 04:28:48.300
For that, we just...

04:28:48.300 --> 04:28:49.300
Let me just find...

04:28:56.300 --> 04:28:57.300
Can I run on water?

04:28:58.300 --> 04:28:59.300
I don't think I can.

04:29:00.300 --> 04:29:01.300
No, I can't.

04:29:09.300 --> 04:29:12.300
The mayor's secret house, maybe?

04:29:14.300 --> 04:29:16.300
I can't believe I forgot to freaking do that.

04:29:16.300 --> 04:29:17.300
You know that?

04:29:17.300 --> 04:29:19.300
Right, I'll remember this for now.

04:29:22.300 --> 04:29:23.300
However...

04:29:24.300 --> 04:29:25.300
Where the heck?

04:29:26.300 --> 04:29:28.300
I'm a bit confuzzled.

04:29:29.300 --> 04:29:31.300
No, you need to keep...

04:29:31.300 --> 04:29:34.300
Left is the one that's not right, I think.

04:29:34.300 --> 04:29:35.300
Now you go back down.

04:29:35.300 --> 04:29:37.300
Right, I think maybe...

04:29:37.300 --> 04:29:39.300
Is this the library quest yet?

04:29:39.300 --> 04:29:43.300
I think the library quest is what needs to happen next.

04:29:45.300 --> 04:29:46.300
Oh, sorry.

04:29:46.300 --> 04:29:47.300
My apologies.

04:29:47.300 --> 04:29:49.300
Oh, there's a staircase down there.

04:29:52.300 --> 04:29:56.300
That mustache-y old guy strikes me somewhat unreliable.

04:29:56.300 --> 04:29:59.300
There's something fishy about this room, too.

04:30:02.300 --> 04:30:05.300
I hope I don't sound like I'm bragging, but I have a certain cabin in Lake.

04:30:05.300 --> 04:30:07.300
It's a gorgeous little place where I go to enjoy my hot...

04:30:07.300 --> 04:30:09.300
Okay, I think that's the hint.

04:30:09.300 --> 04:30:10.300
You want to fuse?

04:30:10.300 --> 04:30:11.300
Yes, I want to fuse.

04:30:14.300 --> 04:30:15.300
Can I run on water?

04:30:15.300 --> 04:30:17.300
Jesus, girl, confirm Gen 2.

04:30:17.300 --> 04:30:22.300
Oh, your name's not Stroneys Remove Tornail, bro.

04:30:24.300 --> 04:30:27.300
No way you called yourself that.

04:30:28.300 --> 04:30:29.300
Holy sh...

04:30:32.300 --> 04:30:34.300
Oh, my God.

04:30:34.300 --> 04:30:35.300
Brutal.

04:30:37.300 --> 04:30:38.300
Absolutely brutal.

04:30:41.300 --> 04:30:42.300
The pick?

04:30:42.300 --> 04:30:44.300
Is that my foot?

04:30:45.300 --> 04:30:47.300
Is that a picture of my toe?

04:30:49.300 --> 04:30:52.300
Have you got a picture of my toe as your profile picture?

04:30:55.300 --> 04:30:57.300
No way.

04:30:57.300 --> 04:30:59.300
That's funny as fuck.

04:31:01.300 --> 04:31:03.300
That's amazing.

04:31:05.300 --> 04:31:08.300
Yeah, I would talk about the experience.

04:31:08.300 --> 04:31:11.300
This person loving here is the mayor, very important.

04:31:11.300 --> 04:31:14.300
Doesn't it just sound also official?

04:31:14.300 --> 04:31:17.300
The mayor, like, strange mask sometimes even makes his own.

04:31:17.300 --> 04:31:19.300
There's a mayor evil.

04:31:21.300 --> 04:31:24.300
Just for a week, okay, okay, okay.

04:31:24.300 --> 04:31:27.300
I would talk about, like, what happened in that,

04:31:27.300 --> 04:31:31.300
but if I'm going to be honest, it was pretty, like...

04:31:32.300 --> 04:31:35.300
A rough experience, so I'd rather just...

04:31:35.300 --> 04:31:36.300
It's TFE.

04:31:36.300 --> 04:31:39.300
Oh, you about it, because I had a bad time.

04:31:41.300 --> 04:31:43.300
But I'm okay, so you don't have to worry.

04:31:43.300 --> 04:31:47.300
No doom, no doom, but it was pretty...

04:31:47.300 --> 04:31:48.300
Not nice.

04:31:48.300 --> 04:31:50.300
So I don't really want to talk about it.

04:31:52.300 --> 04:31:54.300
Right, I think the cabin in the lake was a hint.

04:31:54.300 --> 04:31:56.300
There's no way it was.

04:31:56.300 --> 04:31:59.300
Under construction, digging, prohibited.

04:31:59.300 --> 04:32:01.300
Oh, yeah? What are you going to do if I do this, then?

04:32:01.300 --> 04:32:03.300
Yeah, you're going to fart and clap.

04:32:07.300 --> 04:32:12.300
The bandage gets changed, I guess, technically, after this room.

04:32:13.300 --> 04:32:15.300
There's, like, a chest here.

04:32:16.300 --> 04:32:18.300
Ah, I'm actually so smart.

04:32:18.300 --> 04:32:20.300
I'm, like, 10 out of 10 smart.

04:32:21.300 --> 04:32:23.300
There's a spider there.

04:32:23.300 --> 04:32:25.300
He humped me!

04:32:26.300 --> 04:32:28.300
He wasn't even hurting me. It's just...

04:32:28.300 --> 04:32:30.300
It's a huntsman!

04:32:30.300 --> 04:32:33.300
They don't hurt, but they just, like, look terrifying and stuff.

04:32:33.300 --> 04:32:36.300
Where on earth am I going?

04:32:36.300 --> 04:32:38.300
This is under the town.

04:32:39.300 --> 04:32:41.300
Oh, we're getting red pieces, though.

04:32:41.300 --> 04:32:43.300
I'm not complaining.

04:32:44.300 --> 04:32:45.300
And 100 rupees.

04:32:45.300 --> 04:32:46.300
Hold on a minute.

04:32:46.300 --> 04:32:48.300
Hold on a minute.

04:32:49.300 --> 04:32:51.300
Oh, something's happening.

04:32:51.300 --> 04:32:54.300
I don't know what the heck all this is, but I'll take it.

04:32:55.300 --> 04:32:57.300
Looks like it's a team effort.

04:32:57.300 --> 04:33:00.300
The library quests, by flying to the lake,

04:33:00.300 --> 04:33:02.300
you can't reach the Minish house otherwise.

04:33:03.300 --> 04:33:05.300
Let's fly to the lake.

04:33:09.300 --> 04:33:11.300
Ah, that's really good.

04:33:11.300 --> 04:33:13.300
This is a lot of digging.

04:33:14.300 --> 04:33:17.300
I am a dwarf and I'm digging a wood.

04:33:17.300 --> 04:33:18.300
Diggy, diggy, wood.

04:33:18.300 --> 04:33:20.300
Diggy, diggy, diggy, diggy.

04:33:22.300 --> 04:33:23.300
There's a chest.

04:33:24.300 --> 04:33:25.300
Wow, three red pieces.

04:33:25.300 --> 04:33:27.300
Don't mind if I do, honestly.

04:33:31.300 --> 04:33:33.300
Under construction.

04:33:33.300 --> 04:33:34.300
Yes, that's fine.

04:33:34.300 --> 04:33:37.300
Oh, we can go into the back of the bakery if we get small.

04:33:38.300 --> 04:33:39.300
Can I go in here yet?

04:33:42.300 --> 04:33:46.300
But I can't access the thing.

04:33:54.300 --> 04:33:55.300
I've already forgotten what I'm supposed to do.

04:33:55.300 --> 04:33:56.300
I'm to fly.

04:33:58.300 --> 04:33:59.300
I'm to fly.

04:34:00.300 --> 04:34:01.300
I'm to fly.

04:34:06.300 --> 04:34:08.300
Ah, I am.

04:34:08.300 --> 04:34:09.300
What the heck?

04:34:16.300 --> 04:34:17.300
Hello.

04:34:17.300 --> 04:34:18.300
Oh hi, a visitor.

04:34:18.300 --> 04:34:19.300
How are you?

04:34:19.300 --> 04:34:20.300
But you have phoned me.

04:34:20.300 --> 04:34:22.300
The wisest of the wisest of whys.

04:34:23.300 --> 04:34:24.300
You...

04:34:24.300 --> 04:34:25.300
What?

04:34:25.300 --> 04:34:27.300
You want to enter the temple you can see in the lake.

04:34:27.300 --> 04:34:29.300
They call that place the temple of droplets.

04:34:29.300 --> 04:34:33.300
I've heard rumors that one Minish actually did find a way long ago.

04:34:33.300 --> 04:34:36.300
That Minish is Elder Libri Rari.

04:34:36.300 --> 04:34:40.300
And he is in semi-retirement in Towns Library.

04:34:40.300 --> 04:34:41.300
Yes!

04:34:41.300 --> 04:34:42.300
Okay, thank you.

04:34:42.300 --> 04:34:44.300
Towns Library.

04:34:44.300 --> 04:34:45.300
There we go.

04:34:45.300 --> 04:34:50.300
Luckily we just picked up that piece because we can actually use it.

04:34:50.300 --> 04:34:52.300
What does it do?

04:34:52.300 --> 04:34:55.300
That is at the swamp.

04:34:57.300 --> 04:34:59.300
We should go grab it.

04:34:59.300 --> 04:35:01.300
Yes, we will go grab it.

04:35:01.300 --> 04:35:03.300
Hey, they fit perfectly.

04:35:03.300 --> 04:35:04.300
Yes they do.

04:35:04.300 --> 04:35:05.300
What are the odds?

04:35:05.300 --> 04:35:06.300
Can I trade you again?

04:35:06.300 --> 04:35:07.300
No.

04:35:07.300 --> 04:35:09.300
He lives in the Towns Library.

04:35:09.300 --> 04:35:11.300
Towns Library.

04:35:11.300 --> 04:35:12.300
Library.

04:35:12.300 --> 04:35:13.300
Library.

04:35:13.300 --> 04:35:14.300
Let's go.

04:35:20.300 --> 04:35:22.300
I still have the best feet for me.

04:35:22.300 --> 04:35:23.300
Oh, sorry.

04:35:23.300 --> 04:35:24.300
I accidentally backed out.

04:35:24.300 --> 04:35:26.300
I picked that up though.

04:35:28.300 --> 04:35:29.300
Stop.

04:35:33.300 --> 04:35:36.300
Travel to the library.

04:35:36.300 --> 04:35:38.300
Absolutely.

04:35:38.300 --> 04:35:40.300
Let's see what we're working with.

04:35:40.300 --> 04:35:41.300
Yes!

04:35:43.300 --> 04:35:45.300
We can get in.

04:35:45.300 --> 04:35:46.300
It took us long enough.

04:35:46.300 --> 04:35:47.300
Hello.

04:35:47.300 --> 04:35:51.300
Who is blocking that entire town?

04:35:51.300 --> 04:35:52.300
Oh look!

04:35:52.300 --> 04:35:55.300
Oh look at all the wee baby footprints from the minnish.

04:36:00.300 --> 04:36:04.300
Sometimes these books move on their own, I've seen it with my own two eyes

04:36:04.300 --> 04:36:07.300
and don't tell me I'm crazy, I ain't crazy.

04:36:08.300 --> 04:36:10.300
Oh he makes quite a unique noise.

04:36:10.300 --> 04:36:11.300
Right.

04:36:11.300 --> 04:36:13.300
Let us begin.

04:36:18.300 --> 04:36:21.300
He was raging at them books honestly.

04:36:21.300 --> 04:36:22.300
It was down here.

04:36:22.300 --> 04:36:25.300
I can't swim so I can't do anything.

04:36:26.300 --> 04:36:27.300
And I'm gridlocked.

04:36:27.300 --> 04:36:29.300
Okay I can't do anything yet because I don't know.

04:36:29.300 --> 04:36:30.300
Oh there's a wee guy down there!

04:36:30.300 --> 04:36:31.300
Hiya!

04:36:31.300 --> 04:36:32.300
Americaia!

04:36:32.300 --> 04:36:33.300
Hiya!

04:36:39.300 --> 04:36:40.300
Clean this.

04:36:40.300 --> 04:36:41.300
Hello!

04:36:42.300 --> 04:36:44.300
Oh we can clean this, find the books.

04:36:44.300 --> 04:36:45.300
Hey hey, it's no good, no good at all.

04:36:45.300 --> 04:36:47.300
The humans have checked some books out of the library.

04:36:47.300 --> 04:36:50.300
Thanks to them, none can get back to the elder.

04:36:50.300 --> 04:36:53.300
How, I'm so worried, I'm sure the library knows the books.

04:36:53.300 --> 04:36:58.300
I wish they were big, why I'd walk right up and ask if we're in them books where.

04:36:58.300 --> 04:36:59.300
Okay.

04:36:59.300 --> 04:37:01.300
You want a few pieces, yes please.

04:37:03.300 --> 04:37:04.300
Okay.

04:37:04.300 --> 04:37:06.300
He's just happy you got to meet his mummy.

04:37:09.300 --> 04:37:10.300
Oh.

04:37:10.300 --> 04:37:14.300
A little cavern has been unlocked.

04:37:14.300 --> 04:37:17.300
Any cavern unlocked?

04:37:18.300 --> 04:37:24.300
Hmm it fits perfectly.

04:37:25.300 --> 04:37:30.300

the bookcase but how are we gonna get it we can't reach it we have no ladder and

04:39:43.540 --> 04:39:47.580
I don't think shaking the bookcase will make it fall this presents an interesting

04:39:47.580 --> 04:39:53.540
problem we didn't see if only we already knew what to do

04:39:54.140 --> 04:40:00.660

cuz oh wait no he goes down the chimney well I guess he goes up the chimney as

04:40:11.580 --> 04:40:14.860
well cuz he needs to come back so the cat will swipe at you so if you get a bit

04:40:14.860 --> 04:40:21.660

around the cat look at it shaking his little butt they actually put so much

04:40:34.060 --> 04:40:38.380
detail into this game they could have just done like swipe motion on cat but

04:40:38.380 --> 04:40:44.940
no they like actually did the they did the nature of the cat correctly okay we

04:40:44.940 --> 04:40:49.820
have obtained the first book you got a library book called the hurry on me

04:40:49.820 --> 04:40:56.540
sorry there's one of three books because this game follows the classic rules

04:40:56.540 --> 04:41:08.180
which is as you know wait oh it's open I did not realize it was open almost

04:41:08.180 --> 04:41:17.340
the cat under the book cats are really they're such a silly animal I don't

04:41:17.340 --> 04:41:21.780
sense weird to say but they hate their pain and stuff so if there's something

04:41:21.780 --> 04:41:29.460
wrong with them they won't even tell you oh hello oh here we are you've come to

04:41:29.460 --> 04:41:36.380

your dreams we allow you to fight grand monsters without any danger this is our

04:41:44.900 --> 04:41:49.180
unique same risk but I can't say it if you dispatch the monster skillfully enough

04:41:49.180 --> 04:41:52.820
you might get something nice now even though there's only a simulation it's

04:41:52.820 --> 04:41:56.420
still not for the faint of heart if you should die in the simulation why then

04:41:56.420 --> 04:42:02.460
well I don't know it's never happened did I get a heart for doing this see so

04:42:02.460 --> 04:42:06.980

05:21:51.560 --> 05:21:58.720
touch it while it's trapped in that ice we'll need to melt off somehow yes well

05:21:58.720 --> 05:22:04.840

05:22:04.840 --> 05:22:07.840

05:22:10.520 --> 05:22:23.280
map dungeon Skyrim on legendary I am good at Skyrim aren't I I'm so talented

05:22:23.280 --> 05:22:31.560
like that being able to scour me if we get a new heart we need to go back to

05:22:31.560 --> 05:22:35.960
that guy so the lunches we need to go back to the guy in the swamp as well

05:22:35.960 --> 05:22:45.880

progress that's fine we don't have that yeah but claim ha ha

05:22:58.680 --> 05:23:06.200
there's a little switch here I will ever push it that good then the waterfall

05:23:06.200 --> 05:23:19.200
oh skill what is this thing the way forward is hidden in the bottom of the

05:23:19.360 --> 05:23:32.880
oh it's like a pot thank you for letting me play children's games so I don't

05:23:32.880 --> 05:23:39.600
actually have to play wait then you go all the way back to unlock it I do have a

05:23:39.600 --> 05:23:48.000
key now though I think I do okay hold on hold on let me cook your Skyrim pro I

05:23:48.000 --> 05:23:52.960
need you to teach me the legendary way to plug in that 360 controller and I'll

05:23:52.960 --> 05:23:57.600
possess I don't know how anyone plays legendary on scour them I don't some

05:23:57.600 --> 05:24:01.520
people like always oh I can't believe it people have different preferences to me

05:24:01.520 --> 05:24:06.360
shocking behavior and but like I just enjoy like playing a wee story and like

05:24:06.360 --> 05:24:10.400
going through it I'll say that as if I didn't really enjoy Elden Ring with you

05:24:10.400 --> 05:24:16.800
guys though and so but I only enjoyed Elden Ring because you guys can hold my

05:24:16.800 --> 05:24:22.520
hand through it but like I enjoy like a kind of calm like fun experience it's

05:24:22.520 --> 05:24:26.520
just casual and like you gotta be story and it's like so cute and you can admire

05:24:26.520 --> 05:24:33.280
the the visuals you can admire the sound design the music all of that I just

05:24:33.280 --> 05:24:38.120
think it's rather lovely you know I didn't want to be sitting you know

05:24:38.120 --> 05:24:44.320
playing dark souls replaying I say that I'm kind of saying dark souls but I

05:24:44.320 --> 05:24:47.560
just play Elden Ring and get carried through it so I can't really check anything

05:24:47.560 --> 05:24:56.640
I need to just send this single wow I do that's actually quite humorous um okay

05:24:56.640 --> 05:25:05.160
now we have a platform so we can just I'm sure there's a switch over here often

05:25:05.160 --> 05:25:10.280
they cheese it with self-archer paralysis today we're learning the strap

05:25:10.280 --> 05:25:17.000
hey you yeah you oh sorry well I got what I wanted so I'm actually not that

05:25:17.000 --> 05:25:23.720
sorry is it upper left sorry I'll be faster to manually swim to do this

05:25:23.720 --> 05:25:30.760
it looks like it's up okay it's up or right sorry I totally know my left and

05:25:30.880 --> 05:25:32.880
oh

05:25:36.880 --> 05:25:46.680
Lily pad hello it's all the way at the start

05:25:49.920 --> 05:25:54.120
well excuse me

05:25:55.120 --> 05:26:02.640
how was I supposed to know it was gonna despawn if I wasn't standing on it

05:26:02.640 --> 05:26:11.120
excuse me mr. Lily pad as if I had just missed you from business oh my god

05:26:11.120 --> 05:26:18.880
that's so far to come back with it ah right lesson learned don't go off screen

05:26:18.880 --> 05:26:25.680
without being on the Lily pad oh hell yeah like when Stevie was playing the

05:26:25.680 --> 05:26:31.680
crab treasure game I said this before I thought it was just a casual fun game

05:26:31.680 --> 05:26:37.440
no it's supposed to be like dark souls like I like what cuz I was gonna play it

05:26:37.440 --> 05:26:43.640
and oh I did manage to watch some more about true gameplay I think we can do a

05:26:43.680 --> 05:26:51.040
about true gameplay so a full house is when you have three of any card and two

05:26:51.040 --> 05:26:58.320
of any card and oh I'm gonna get hurt here my apologies oh I didn't need the

05:26:58.320 --> 05:27:08.440
house okay stop geez and straight is when you have a missing one from a flush

05:27:09.040 --> 05:27:15.000
no a flush is when you have a missing one but a straight flush is when you have

05:27:15.000 --> 05:27:22.280
five that are correct in the sequence and then you can do like two doubles or

05:27:22.280 --> 05:27:29.400
you can play quads and so I think I think we can successfully do a

05:27:29.480 --> 05:27:42.200
about true stream without perishing too much what's this what's a royal flush when

05:27:42.200 --> 05:27:52.520
the flush has King Queen and Jack in it I'm gonna get turds dropped on my head I

05:27:52.520 --> 05:27:59.040
think I don't know I'm not sure but I have enough knowledge to try and win at

05:27:59.040 --> 05:28:03.480
the game a ball true is one of those games where if you lose you lose but

05:28:03.480 --> 05:28:22.360
it's fine I'm gonna slide in any I'm gonna sneeze sorry sorry and down Ray

05:28:22.360 --> 05:28:36.560
south west go down Ray and then south and then west and then off okay flush is

05:28:36.560 --> 05:28:44.200
seems to straight is in any sequence royal flushes a oops okay I got close

05:28:44.200 --> 05:28:53.920
close to the answer was a perfect place to see what a wonderful scene yes also

05:28:53.920 --> 05:29:05.600
I'm such a kawaii name game whichever huh I'm so kawaii name no short to scare

05:29:05.600 --> 05:29:08.640
yes you're more than welcome you're more than welcome I'll sneeze in your open

05:29:08.640 --> 05:29:16.880
mouth anytime you need not ask with me for I will deliver I cannot do anything

05:29:16.880 --> 05:29:29.640
about him I'm covered in dookie I went brown there lol actually covered in dookie

05:29:29.640 --> 05:29:41.800
they're not I mean I have to leave now link where are you are you so under me it's

05:29:41.800 --> 05:29:45.840
so dark I can't see my beak in front of my face and watch your step I don't want

05:29:45.840 --> 05:29:50.920
you to trip over anything very dark I'm not supposed to be able to see at this

05:29:51.640 --> 05:30:01.120
sure oh well I'll can see no actually get shown I'm getting rolled in the

05:30:01.120 --> 05:30:05.080
child's game can't believe it I'm so excited for you up in the next month

05:30:05.080 --> 05:30:11.080
and cameo we can start collecting our gamers oh not these guys these guys are

05:30:11.080 --> 05:30:19.760
actually pretty troublesome especially when there's a room full of them hurt

05:30:19.760 --> 05:30:30.400
myself by accident I suppose on purpose what have I got to hell I'll maybe do a

05:30:30.400 --> 05:30:39.640
bit of exploring after this because now once we are not whoa okay we're we're

05:30:39.640 --> 05:30:46.720
almost finished the dungeon if we've got that and we'll definitely go exploring

05:30:46.720 --> 05:30:50.840
after this one to get like fill hearts and all the items and stuff because I

05:30:50.840 --> 05:30:56.760
think we're supposed to have more health by now and like do like more of the

05:30:56.760 --> 05:31:00.720
swimming because now the swimming's unlocked and digging is unlocked we have

05:31:00.720 --> 05:31:11.480
so much more access to stuff unless we go get the last item of course sunlight

05:31:11.480 --> 05:31:16.600

05:49:20.600 --> 05:49:34.920
it. Oh, I missed. And I shot and I missed again. And I shot and I missed again. So this

05:49:34.920 --> 05:49:48.360
is the second one. Okay, I can handle that. We already got them. Oh, things are falling

05:49:48.360 --> 05:50:09.520
on my head. I don't like it. Easy. Take it easy, buddy. Oh, is he just spamming it? I'll

05:50:09.520 --> 05:50:20.480
take it. If you're just spamming it, I'll take it. Is it a dry bite? Wow, we did it. We

05:50:20.480 --> 05:50:32.600
have 10 minutes to spare for Shabby. Let's go. We get the element. What is it? The water?

05:50:32.600 --> 05:50:46.080
It must be water. Ice element doesn't make sense. You got the water element. Water quenches

05:50:46.080 --> 05:50:51.640
thirst, ends droughts and nourishes life. The water element is the embodiment of that power.

05:50:51.640 --> 05:51:00.040
I love and a heart. Oh, we can go to that man. That will teach us properly. One, two, three, four.

05:51:00.040 --> 05:51:11.600
Yeah. Yeah. Let's get the heck out of here. I won't be here anymore. Here we go. Shabby's live

05:51:11.600 --> 05:51:27.240
right now. Wait, I thought it was a 10. Oh, it is 10 already. Oh, young one. Child who

05:51:27.240 --> 05:51:36.880
seeks to aid the princess of Hyrule. My name is Gustaf. I was king of Hyrule countless ages ago.

05:51:36.880 --> 05:51:49.000
Stand before me. Only then will the path be open to you. Huh, was that just a dream? He said he

05:51:49.000 --> 05:51:55.400
was the king of Hyrule. Wait, look at your map, Link. There's something marked on it. Huh, I guess

05:51:55.400 --> 05:52:00.760
that means it wasn't a dream? We should head there once we've infused your sword with that element.

05:52:01.200 --> 05:52:06.640
To the elemental sanctuary at once. Okay, then it's graveyard, then it's

05:52:06.640 --> 05:52:17.440
airtop, and then we're done. Yeah, we made some fast progress. Holy moly. I definitely think we

05:52:17.440 --> 05:52:32.560
should be exploring now. Because we're definitely getting close to end game content. What time is

05:52:32.560 --> 05:52:41.880
that? Okay, I am going to end there. And then for members, I am going to do a membership stream.

05:52:42.800 --> 05:52:49.920
In like 10 minutes, I will put it up. You cannot see the stream right now because I've not put it up.

05:52:49.920 --> 05:52:58.160
But don't worry, I will put it up. If you give me 10 minutes after I end the stream for any members

05:52:58.160 --> 05:53:06.840
of the channel, we are going to be doing the forbidden, the forbidden tier list. I'm not sure

05:53:06.840 --> 05:53:21.400
how long that's gonna take. We'll see, we'll see. As for any, any what? Any notes? I'm going to try

05:53:21.400 --> 05:53:33.920
and upload my special 2000 thank you. Today, I'm also going to try and see if I tomorrow I can

05:53:33.920 --> 05:53:38.120
upload the first collab with Mimosa. She has been waiting so patiently. I mean, Denpah's been

05:53:38.120 --> 05:53:44.480
waiting patiently. And so is this third person that I haven't told yous who I'm collabing with. I

05:53:44.480 --> 05:53:53.400
don't think. Your hint is like wolf. Right, customization, redirect, and to none other than

05:53:53.400 --> 05:54:00.360
Shibi Quarrenboom. Oh, Shibi is doing smash her pass with Toma Keys. I actually don't know much

05:54:00.360 --> 05:54:07.880
about Toma Keys, but if Shibi knows her, then we are in good company. Shibi has fantastic friends.

05:54:07.880 --> 05:54:13.880
Right, in 10 minutes without strany. Yes, give me 10 minutes. I'm going to see if I can drop

05:54:13.880 --> 05:54:18.240
a loaf of bread. I'm going to make a cup of tea and all of that. But give me a few minutes and then

05:54:18.240 --> 05:54:23.200
the stream will pop up. Don't worry. For those of you who are unable to member, please don't worry.

05:54:23.200 --> 05:54:28.400
I always have free content daily and not only are you getting the stream, you're also getting a

05:54:28.440 --> 05:54:34.640
video today as well. That will come up on YouTube soon to you. Thank you so so much for hanging

05:54:34.640 --> 05:54:43.640
and we will finish this fantastic childhood game tomorrow. Nothing, nothing but fantastic nostalgia

05:54:43.640 --> 05:54:52.720
this stream has been. And I will see you, if I don't see you in 10 minutes, I will see you tomorrow

05:54:52.960 --> 05:54:58.400
to finish this fantastic game. Thank you so so much, Reflings. Please do say hi to Shibi for me.

05:54:58.400 --> 05:55:04.480
I'm going to run away and drop a bomb in the toilet. Well, you guys can get comfy with Shibi, okay?

05:55:04.480 --> 05:55:08.400
Thank you so so much, Reflings. See you until tomorrow or until 10 minutes, okay?
