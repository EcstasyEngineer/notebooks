1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,160
Want to start your own VTuber Agency?

2
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:03,040
Don't!

3
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:08,400
But if you insist, then here's stuff I wish I knew beforehand or was realistic about before

4
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:09,600
starting operations.

5
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:15,920
1. Make sure before you start ordering artworks or assets that you have fully fleshed out

6
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:20,160
reference sheets of your VTubers or else you will constantly be going back and forth with

7
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:25,120
artists for fixes. That's time and money wasted when it could have been done right the first time.

8
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:27,440
2. Make sure you have the money to burn.

9
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:31,600
Whatever cost you estimated in your head, double it then add some more.

10
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:34,480
Vealor's original budget was $30,000 USD.

11
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:38,880
The reality, double it and add some more.

12
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:42,480
3. Do not expect unrealistic things from your talents.

13
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:46,000
You have to enable your talents so helping with clipping, video ideas,

14
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,040
submitting ideas means your talents can achieve their dreams.

15
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:52,960
And most of all, check what your talents internet speeds are.

16
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:55,120
Most likely someone is still on dial up.

17
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:56,800
Hmm.
