00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Being a VTuber and having to do taxes can be very interesting.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:09,700
By definition, anything you have to purchase in order to run your business may be eligible for a tax write-off.

3
00:00:09,700 --> 00:00:16,900
Meaning that things such as a live 2D model, artworks, editors, advertisements, script writers, heck, even songwriters

4
00:00:16,900 --> 00:00:19,800
can give you a cheeky reduction in your overall tax bill.

5
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:21,000
But wait, there's more.

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Your internet and your electricity bill, even the rent if you live somewhere where you have a separate room to work in.

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,700
It's also the exact same experience for loot VTuber activities as well.

8
00:00:30,700 --> 00:00:37,300
So yeah, I have looked my accountant in the eyes and claimed back artworks of a very unique variety.
