1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Hold on hold on hold on

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
There's not a lot of chance, I will chance my life

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
I hope I'm on the right thing

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,000
And then

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,000
They're not messed up

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Who's driving this booze?

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Come on boys is so messed up

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Valor

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Am I streaming? I don't see it.

10
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:41,000
It'll be live for 40 seconds. I can't even see myself.

11
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Oh, there we go. Hey, I can hear myself.

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Ah, I totally lost my voice. Testing.

13
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Ah, freaking scary.

14
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Broke my damn voice on that bloody stream.

15
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Didn't that be alert? Did you like that smoke? Did you like it?

16
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Right, from here on out, it's nothing but scuffing memes.

17
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
If you're looking for professionals, go elsewhere, buddy.

18
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Go to Shibi's stream. There's no happening here.

19
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I promise you, mate. My voice is so strange right now.

20
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Oh, my goodness. Just the way we were like,

21
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Oh, it's been a bloody while since we've been together.

22
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Fuck me, man. That took me a year to spawn this.

23
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Oh, my God.

24
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I did it, though. Holy shit, we did it.

25
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Feet sniffer. I didn't mean to imply greed.

26
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
No, you didn't. I know you didn't. Please don't worry.

27
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Please don't worry. It's fine.

28
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:39,000
The only reason I say greed is because of the perspective thing.

29
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Oh, fucking mischief, reflins. My fucking God.

30
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,000
What a year it's been. Holy crap.

31
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
I know I'm supposed to talk about my debut,

32
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,000
but let's be honest, we're all reflins here.

33
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Oh, fucking mischiefs.

34
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Of course, your names were going to be refling.

35
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Oh, my God.

36
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
What do you mean you became a squid vtuber

37
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:09,000
just so your name may only reflect you in another life?

38
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Oh, come on. Refling.

39
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Come on. If I'm on a reef, get it?

40
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Great barrier. Reef. Reef.

41
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Oh, I'm so excited to play Assassin's Creed Brotherhood with you.

42
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:29,000
When this stream ends, I'm going to unlist all my streams.

43
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Any reefers on the track? Are reefers cannabis?

44
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
I can't say that.

45
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Does reeflings mean something different?

46
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
In another life, I had a fan base called Reeflings,

47
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
but it was spelled slightly different.

48
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:52,000
And I made it pronounced the same, but spelled differently.

49
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Yeah.

50
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Don't worry.

51
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Don't worry.

52
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
If you're not really familiar with me from the past,

53
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
don't worry about it.

54
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Okay, don't worry about it.

55
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
I'm just strong at cuttles. Let's keep it that way.

56
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Thank you very much.

57
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Okay, am I actually going through my 2.0

58
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:14,000
or are we just squidding around?

59
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
My bottle.

60
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
I have my reefing mail.

61
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Skullfish.

62
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Oh, Skullfish is so good.

63
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Oh, that's actually really small.

64
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Okay.

65
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Thank you.

66
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Right, I'll actually go through my slides,

67
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
but I'm not really sure if there's much of a point,

68
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:39,000
because, well,

69
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:44,000
that's Johnny's 365 from Beast's Suck It.

70
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Moment.

71
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Product or moment.

72
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Right, let me drink my cola.

73
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Let me drink my cola.

74
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Yeah, I was supposed to say 5.3.

75
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Also, someone doubted that Scots is a recognized language.

76
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
It is.

77
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
So, you know how it sounds like I'm speaking English here all the time?

78
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
I'm going to give you a sentence, okay?

79
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
I'm going to type it in chat so you can read it.

80
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:13,000
So, that is a sentence in Scots that I've just typed, okay?

81
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
And it says,

82
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Are you coming to my bit tonight?

83
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
That means, are you coming to my house tonight?

84
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
That's Scots.

85
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
He has a bit different.

86
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
It's not in the best sense,

87
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
but it's what I can think of on the top of my head, but yeah.

88
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Are you coming to my bit tonight?

89
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
It means, are you coming to my house?

90
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,000
And I purposely don't really speak with a lot of slang

91
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,000
or mumble the way I naturally do,

92
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,000
because I'm quite naturally monotone and mumbley,

93
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
because the problem is,

94
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:47,000
you guys don't understand me because I'm Scots.

95
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:55,000
But if you are British or you're familiar with the Scottish accent,

96
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
then I probably actually don't sound from Scots indeed,

97
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
but it is what it is.

98
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
And also, I've been very, like,

99
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,000
when you're on the internet, you're very Americanised

100
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
with what you consume.

101
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Does it take all your efforts to pronounce every syllable

102
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
and not speak Scots?

103
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:15,000
No, my mother dearest,

104
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,000
she actually taught me,

105
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:25,000
she discouraged me from speaking in slang,

106
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,000
so I doesn't always naturally come out,

107
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
but here's what it is.

108
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Here's how it was at the beginning.

109
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,000
I said, fucking cheers to that mate, cheers to that.

110
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,000
But yeah, technically, legally, on paper,

111
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
because I was born in Scotland,

112
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,000
I could speak two languages, thank you.

113
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:49,000
I don't need any help from Joe Lingo, let's go.

114
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:54,000
But yeah, so I'm a siren that can't sing.

115
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Gee willikers, I wonder why.

116
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
I just don't have a voice.

117
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
I'm also tone deaf, by the way,

118
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,000
so I hope you're ready for drunk karaoke streams.

119
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,000
That stuff's gonna be intense.

120
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Let's see where these slides are.

121
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,000
So both of your parents are Scots, eh?

122
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Yeah, the band-aids hold up, still top tier.

123
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Yep, very top tier.

124
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Mongolian throat singing.

125
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
The reason I don't like Mongolian throat singing

126
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
is because cats don't like Mongolian throat singing,

127
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
because of the vibration.

128
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
It's an unpleasant sound.

129
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,000
I have learned many traits of cats, so I don't like it.

130
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Drunk karaoke.

131
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Shibi's doing drunk ASMR this week.

132
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
If that's your...

133
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Is that your thing?

134
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
To say, is that your thing?

135
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
And Scots, you go, is that your thing?

136
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Is that I?

137
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Is that your thing?

138
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Oh, it is him and I.

139
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
And...

140
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
There you go.

141
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Yeah, I did some basic stuff.

142
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Oh, my lore's being retconned, by the way.

143
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Thanks to you guys.

144
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Apparently, my weaknesses are mirrors,

145
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,000
which I really fucking like.

146
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
I'm definitely gonna do something with that,

147
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
because I think it's such a cool thing.

148
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
I should have done it like a fucking character reference,

149
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
like strengths, weaknesses,

150
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
because that would have been so much cooler to do the havel.

151
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
I actually have started reading this year.

152
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
I had a really rough year last year.

153
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Gee, I wonder.

154
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
And I started...

155
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
I picked up reading.

156
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
I have never read in my life.

157
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
And...

158
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Turns out, I really like the stopian novels.

159
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Like George Orwell was so good.

160
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Like Animal Farm in 1984.

161
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
I absolutely love 1984.

162
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Fahrenheit was good.

163
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
I've read the classics.

164
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
I'm not read that much, but...

165
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
I see you're readin' right?

166
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Yeah.

167
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
The Women in the Dunes, as well,

168
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,000
is like the perfect, like, book,

169
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:06,000
because it, like, encapsulates, like, human nature.

170
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
And...

171
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,000
I just love, like, depressing books.

172
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
I love being depressed at the end and being like,

173
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
no, humanity didn't prevail.

174
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
No, not humanity, what's the word?

175
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Human nature didn't prevail against the odds.

176
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
I've got the Hobbit.

177
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:26,000
I've not read it yet, but I have the physical copy of the Hobbit.

178
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
And I'm so excited.

179
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Um...

180
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Yeah, I'm not much of a...

181
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
The girls, by far, are more weebs than me.

182
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
I am, by far, the gamer.

183
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Like, I played the most games.

184
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Doesn't mean I'm good before anyone fucking complains.

185
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Every time you mention you play games,

186
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:46,000
what do you mean you're not top 500 in this game?

187
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,000
You suck, like, no, I play video games.

188
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Fucking relax, I bet you're shit at them, too.

189
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Like, my god, can you hear yourself?

190
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,000
You're actually, like, so fucking negative.

191
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Anyway, I'll help you get more positive.

192
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Actually, the reason why you're negative

193
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
is because you're KD's negative,

194
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
because you're scrubbing the game.

195
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
That's why you just project.

196
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Anyway, that's just me.

197
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Uh, music, I'm really generic with music.

198
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,000
I don't listen to music much, okay?

199
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Uh, movies, Lord of the Rings, we're at hell, yeah?

200
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Uh, if you don't know, uh, I have plans for on Christmas

201
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:25,000
and Boxing Day, uh, to watch Lord of the Rings

202
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,000
and The Hobbit, Phil Marathon, absolutely adore it.

203
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Uh, that would be public stream,

204
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,000
no gate keeping, no membership, none of that jazz.

205
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Oh, special thank you to everyone who watched the debut.

206
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:42,000
I already meet the requirements for monetization on YouTube.

207
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:47,000
The problem is the stats don't update for, like, 48 hours.

208
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,000
So I can technically, like, I already meet the requirements.

209
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
I just need to submit myself to YouTube.

210
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,000
And then I can do my monetization stream!

211
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:59,000
And I'm so excited, because my idea is so cursed.

212
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,000
But I just want to say, for anyone who's watching me right now,

213
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:06,000
if you don't like VTubers doing webcam streams,

214
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,000
showing their hands or their feet,

215
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:13,000
I'm not a VTuber for you, however FILR Girls, absolutely.

216
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Check them out in the description.

217
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
You can hit subscribe!

218
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Uhm...

219
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:23,000
But, yes, absolutely no hints to what my monetization stream's going to be.

220
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Uhuhuhuh!

221
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Mmmhmm?

222
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Mmmhmmmmmm!

223
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:31,000
You ain't ready, I literally need to go to a nail parlor.

224
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:36,000
I've been growing my nails for three weeks

225
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
for the monetization stream.

226
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:45,000
of having long nails. I hate it, I hate it, but I'm doing it for you.

227
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Animes, uh, um, Kaki-Guri, still one of my top. Kaki-Guri, Kaga-Guri, Kaga-Guri, still

228
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:59,000
one of my top. It's probably one of my top. I don't, I can't think of anything that.

229
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Actually, fun fact, do you want to know the very first anime I got tricked into watching?

230
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Fucking Boku no Pico, or whatever the frickin' Dilla, Piccadilla sauce, whatever the frickin' thing is.

231
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:18,000
That is the first exposure to anime I ever had, and I was mortified. Mortified!

232
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:23,000
I had no concept, a little innocent me, tick-tackin' on the keyboard.

233
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Ooh, this anime's being recommended! I should watch it!

234
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:32,000
And then, so I was really dumb, do you know how it has a warning at the start?

235
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:37,000
I didn't know what that word meant, like, and I watched it.

236
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:41,000
I was like, where is this ice cube going?

237
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:47,000
And, like, and actually, I want to use my notice.

238
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:55,000
My first ever exposure to, uh, uh, like an anime that wasn't Boku no Pico, it related, was a brother in...

239
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Oh my god, ooh! Sorry, I thought there was a spider on me, holy crap.

240
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,000
It wasn't. It was my cover.

241
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:08,000
My first anime exposure, it was either...

242
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:13,000
It must have been an anime based on a manga that got popular, because that's how most anime's turned out, Ida.

243
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:18,000
It was a brother and sister. Hold on! Hold on!

244
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Hold the frickin' phone for y'all circle men.

245
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:24,000
It was brother and sister, and then it was...

246
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:30,000
The sister is a flesh eater, and the guy's like, oh, it's fine.

247
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:35,000
And he has, like, regenerative powers or something?

248
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:38,000
I'm sure one of you guys know what it is.

249
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:45,000
It was either a manga I read or a thingy, but she had to, like, eat him for some reason,

250
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,000
and she was like, oh, I'm so sorry for eating you, hum hum hum hum hum.

251
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
And I was like, oh!

252
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Yeah, that was the first of her anime exposure that, like, I got into, and I was like, oh, this shit's crazy.

253
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:01,000
And then I discovered what Pururin is.

254
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Many a day on Pururin.

255
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,000
And then they shut down the website, Rippin' Piss.

256
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:10,000
You will be missed, actually. Sorry, my voice is absolutely short.

257
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:14,000
I promise this isn't my default voice, it's because I'm so excited to talk to you.

258
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,000
I've broken my voice already.

259
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,000
I came back.

260
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Shut up, Pururin did not come. Hold on.

261
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Hold on, we're doing research like Pururin.

262
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Pururin.

263
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Oh my god, no! I'm sorry, I'm sorry!

264
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:37,000
I have, I may have a bikini toggle.

265
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:44,000
I may have a bikini toggle for water ASMR streams.

266
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
I am so sorry.

267
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:53,000
I will unbind the keys for an X-treme.

268
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:57,000
I will take your word chat that Pururin is back.

269
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,000
I apologize for that.

270
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
My deepest condolence.

271
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Okay, no.

272
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Okay, I don't even know what to say to that.

273
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Right, move it on, swiftly.

274
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
And, swiftly, swiftly.

275
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:22,000
We'll take another drink of me, Nikola.

276
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:28,000
I don't even know what key did that.

277
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Was it you, maybe?

278
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Literally, I look over at my screen and I'm like, where's my Yucata?

279
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Where did it go? Why is it through the window?

280
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Anyway, next, next thing.

281
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Yes, Childhood Games!

282
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Oh my god, I am so happy that Xbox Game Pass is a thing.

283
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:48,000
I need to create an account, I don't know what to call it yet.

284
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,000
I want to make it something like Mimi or Funny.

285
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
But yeah, anyway, I'm an Xbox kid

286
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:02,000
and if you were able to catch the group stream,

287
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:06,000
it's actually true that I had to present games to my dad to buy for me.

288
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Or he would just buy it for me because he was like,

289
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
oh, that's good for response-o.

290
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Inherit your dad's account.

291
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:24,000
So, these are the majority of the games that I remember.

292
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,000
I'm going to do tons of Xbox games.

293
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
I'm an Xbox kid.

294
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:32,000
I never had a PlayStation at all.

295
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:36,000
So I didn't have access.

296
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
I had a PlayStation.

297
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
My dad got a PlayStation 1.

298
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:45,000
I didn't know how to read, like, no.

299
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:52,000
So I'm just trying to think, like, the timeline.

300
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,000
A lot of these games I've played, I didn't even have the ability to read yet.

301
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Like, I used to watch my dad play the games because I was so small.

302
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:06,000
But yeah, basically.

303
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Sonic Generations.

304
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Is Sonic Generations the one that was made after Sonic Heroes?

305
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
I've not played BioShock 2.

306
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
No, I played BioShock 1.

307
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
Well, you had bees.

308
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Bees?

309
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
My sweet little bumblebee.

310
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
I know what you want from me.

311
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Hypnosis-themed feature where I really like hypnosis.

312
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:40,000
I've never done it before, but I'm going to participate in it and try and get it for you.

313
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
I never played Sonic Generations then.

314
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:46,000
No, I played Sonic Heroes and then there was a bit of a skip.

315
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,000
I played Sonic Unleashed where he's like that werewolf.

316
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:52,000
But I got stuck in the game because I was, like, too young.

317
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Not very smart. I'm not a very smart gamer, okay?

318
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:01,000
Which is why I am perfectly happy with

319
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
hand-holding through games.

320
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:06,000
Some streamers really don't like backseat gaming.

321
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
For me, absolutely do not mind it.

322
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
I'm daft, okay?

323
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
I'm completely daft.

324
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
I have no clue what's going on.

325
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,000
Would we be hypnotised to vote for you as president?

326
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Oh my god.

327
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:26,000
But yeah, so definitely going to replay a lot of Xbox games

328
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:30,000
as my childhood dream was that 100k thingy.

329
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:35,000
I only had the opportunity to play Fable 3.

330
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
Wait, let me see what's behind me.

331
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Hold on. What's behind me?

332
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:42,000
Oh, Viva Pinata, Trials Evolution.

333
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Right now my game of choice is The Binding of Isaac.

334
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,000
It's an absolutely fantastic game.

335
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:54,000
It becomes multiplayer in November.

336
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Multiplayer in November.

337
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,000
Just a warning for anyone who is out there

338
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
binding their Isaac.

339
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,000
November games, multiplayer games

340
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,000
are most likely going to be Isaac.

341
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:12,000
I apologise. I too.

342
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
The best Halo game in your opinion.

343
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,000
I'm biased and can say combat evolved

344
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
because my dad used to play it over and over

345
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:24,000
and I used to hide behind the couch.

346
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,000
I was so scared from the grunty oneies.

347
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
They were so scary.

348
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
You actually finished Meat Boy.

349
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
Damn it, like I finished Meat Boy.

350
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
No, I played it. These games don't necessarily mean

351
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
I'm finished them, but yeah.

352
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
Hamster's Lifestream win.

353
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:42,000
Yeah, you want to play a hamster game together.

354
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Yeah.

355
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
Is combat evolved the first one?

356
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:51,000
Yeah, sorry. Halo combat evolved is the first one.

357
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:56,000
You're like Crash Land and everyone dies, but you...

358
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
It's just scary.

359
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
They're straight up.

360
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
What in the strip club, straight up binding it

361
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:07,000
and by it, let's just say my Isaac.

362
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
Oh my god, my favourite meme right now

363
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:12,000
is like, replace the A with a F

364
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,000
and then it says fart, relax, snowflake.

365
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:18,000
It's called Dark Humour. It's my favourite meme right now.

366
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:26,000
I've also got those old games

367
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
from the Xbox original days.

368
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,000
Definitely going to give them a shot again.

369
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:34,000
AC actually mentioned that she played

370
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
American McGee's Alice

371
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:40,000
and I've played Alice in Madness Returns

372
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
and I thought she was going to say

373
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,000
she played American McGee's Alice, but...

374
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
Yeah.

375
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
God of War

376
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
enjoyed that, that was good.

377
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:59,000
I need to play Shadow of Mordor properly.

378
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
I actually want to play the Golem game

379
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:04,000
that got absolutely review bombed.

380
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,000
Everyone hated it, but I feel like I'm like

381
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:10,000
Tismo enough because it's Lord of the Rings

382
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
Lord of the Rings related

383
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
to play it and the entire time

384
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
I want to do Golem's voice

385
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
and I'm like, thank you.

386
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
I like absolutely wrecked my voice

387
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
to like roleplay as Golem.

388
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,000
I mean, you know, we started again.

389
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:28,000
I'd love to do that.

390
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
My face when I didn't realise Madness Returns

391
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,000
in the sequel.

392
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:34,000
Oh, mercy, I'm about to ruin your day.

393
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:37,000
There was a third instalment called

394
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:41,000
Alice Asylum and EA rejected it.

395
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
The game has been fully conceptualised,

396
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:47,000
EA rejected it and now it's gathering dust.

397
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:50,000
So that's just to ruin your day.

398
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
There was to be a third instalment

399
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,000
of Alice in Wonderland and EA, yeah, again, ruined it.

400
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
Yay, yay, yay.

401
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
Do we hey, yeah? Yeah, we hey, yeah.

402
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:04,000
Sorry to ruin your day, but that's true.

403
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
What other games?

404
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
Dishonoured was good.

405
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:12,000
Stealth was a bit funny at times,

406
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
but definitely happy to play that again.

407
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
I'm gonna burp, I'm so sorry.

408
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,000
Oh, no, I'm not.

409
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
I don't have to be professional anymore.

410
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,000
It's Karambit.

411
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
Oh, my God, what a terrible man.

412
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
I heard Monster Hunter.

413
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
Oh, hi, Dempah again.

414
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
How's it going, Dempah?

415
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:42,000
I've heard Monster Hunter has bagpipes in it,

416
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:46,000
like as a weapon, but it's the most, like, hardest thing to play

417
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
instead of, like, a sword.

418
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
Dishonoured, good, yeah, good.

419
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
I'm drawing while watching you.

420
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
Did you guys know that Dempah

421
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:01,000
created her own VTuber art model?

422
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,000
Isn't that amazing?

423
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
That's, like, literally so talented.

424
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:09,000
Talented as in terms of all her hard-working effort

425
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
and blood, sweat and tears that she's put into

426
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
honing her craft and art.

427
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:16,000
I read this thing ages ago about artists being, like,

428
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
we don't really like it when you say it's, like,

429
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
overnight talent, because it's not.

430
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
It's, like, you honed your craft

431
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
and, like, you should be proud of honing your craft.

432
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
You didn't just spawn in as an artist, you know?

433
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,000
Gifted, that's it, you're not gifted.

434
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
You honed your craft, you spent years on it.

435
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
You got your XP bar raised.

436
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:37,000
Anyway, that's just my small rant about being nice to artists.

437
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:40,000
They aren't gifted, they have spent years

438
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:44,000
specialising into a skill bar, okay?

439
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,000
Thank you.

440
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
More VTuber babies.

441
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
Oh, you know what game I really liked?

442
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:05,000
I say this every time is, um, what is it called?

443
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:09,000
College or a ghost alien mode was so good.

444
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
I don't care what anyone says.

445
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,000
It's so very good.

446
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
I could for you any young.

447
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
We in boys with Denver.

448
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,000
Denver, Denver.

449
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
Sorry, I said it from my voice.

450
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
Yeah, notice there's no Halo 2,

451
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:24,000
because I never got a chance to play it.

452
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
No, there is, is Halo not there?

453
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,000
Wait, Halo 2 should be there.

454
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,000
I played all the Halo's.

455
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
Hold on, Analyze, Analyze them in.

456
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
Zoom in. Analyzing.

457
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
Oh wait, okay, I can grab it.

458
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,000
Where is it?

459
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,000
It's a place for debut.

460
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,000
There we go.

461
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:46,000
Analyzing where Halo 2, Halo 2, Halo 2 unidentified.

462
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,000
Okay, I guess.

463
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
I have played all the Halo's.

464
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:52,000
I wanted to, I've not played the new Red Dead Redemption.

465
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,000
Oh my God.

466
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,000
Well, it's not new.

467
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
It's been out for years now by this point,

468
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:59,000
but definitely do Assassin's Creed.

469
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:03,000
We're 100% doing Ezio's storyline.

470
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
I'm going to be really controversial.

471
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:08,000
Couldn't be a shite once they killed Ezio off.

472
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,000
I mean, he had three installments.

473
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
It's not like he was killed off.

474
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,000
Wait, what?

475
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,000
I didn't know it fit.

476
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,000
Does that not fit you?

477
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,000
What?

478
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,000
You should be there.

479
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,000
Okay, I did it, I did it.

480
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
Alien isolation, get to fuck.

481
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,000
I'm not playing that game.

482
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,000
That's a terrible game.

483
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,000
Wait, what is?

484
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,000
That's chat.

485
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,000
That's not background music.

486
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,000
Halo?

487
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,000
You need to be above?

488
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,000
Yeah, jeez.

489
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,000
Wait, no, chat.

490
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,000
Oh my God, sorry.

491
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,000
I'm having a stroke.

492
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,000
And not the good kind.

493
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
Best Assassin's Creed Brotherhood.

494
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:45,000
Assassin's Creed Brotherhood is the best Assassin's Creed

495
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,000
installment of all time.

496
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
I am not taking any questions, statements,

497
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:51,000
arguments, or bomb threats to Veiler headquarters.

498
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,000
I'm sorry.

499
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,000
It's just a bit.

500
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,000
I will explain.

501
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,000
We're playing it tomorrow.

502
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:59,000
I will explain to you chapter by chapter,

503
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:02,000
step by step on why it's just the most perfect

504
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:07,000
thought out, like, optimized game for, like,

505
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,000
gameplay.

506
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:11,000
Just every, I will, I will explain it all.

507
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:14,000
I'm actually making a video essay about Assassin's

508
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,000
Creed Brotherhood.

509
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
It's going to be one of my donuts on rewards.

510
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,000
I've already recorded the footage to do it.

511
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:22,000
I just need to write the script and everything.

512
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:25,000
But, like, I kid you not, I'm doing, like, a video essay

513
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,000
40 minutes long.

514
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,000
I don't care.

515
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,000
I'm, like, going to fill Tizmo and Lush.

516
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:32,000
Okay, we've been on games for quite a while now.

517
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:35,000
I'm, like, you guys are probably sick of staring at these

518
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,000
games.

519
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
Um, how did that not?

520
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:41,000
I don't think I've done this wrong.

521
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,000
Hey, hello.

522
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:46,000
Uh, I think I've said all the games.

523
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,000
Yeah.

524
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:50,000
Oh, we're playing old-school Rinske.

525
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,000
Eight hour Assassin's Creed Brotherhood lore coming in.

526
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,000
What have I done?

527
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:58,000
Probably, like, less than an hour.

528
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:04,000
Um, yes, probably, uh, old-school Rinscape is our weekend

529
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,000
game.

530
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,000
It's going to be mostly a multiplayer game for this month

531
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:14,000
until June 19th when the Eldon...

532
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:18,000
Wait, why the fuck is there two?

533
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
Oh, I must have missed one.

534
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:23,000
Um, you've never played RuneScape.

535
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,000
Don't worry, we're doing questing.

536
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:30,000
My only problem with old-school RuneScape is I think you have

537
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:34,000
to pay the premium experience for premium or we're all just

538
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:37,000
going to get shafted playing that game, like, not in a good

539
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,000
way.

540
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:43,000
Um, but yes, Eldon Ring DLC comes out on the 19th and then

541
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,000
the multiplayer game for, like, four days in a row.

542
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,000
I'm doing multiplayer games.

543
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,000
You need to teach me old-school RuneScape.

544
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:52,000
Literally, I just go fishing at the back of Lumbridge.

545
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,000
Lummi Castle.

546
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:58,000
Not the back, next to the main bit south of the castle.

547
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:02,000
Um, but I, uh, what was the single word?

548
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:06,000
Oh, probably four days of multiplayer Eldon Ring.

549
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:10,000
And then I have a very unique stream come in with the first

550
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:14,000
collab outside of Vealor at the end of the month with a

551
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:17,000
feature called Sin Sister.

552
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:21,000
And we may or may not have both purchased shock collars,

553
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:24,000
which we will give each other control of the shock collars.

554
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:28,000
And we are going to play multiplayer Eldon Ring and whoever

555
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:32,000
causes us to die, whichever one causes us to die, gets to

556
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
shock them, basically.

557
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:37,000
Yep, we are, we're doing that.

558
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:41,000
Um, I believe Sheeby is also getting a shock collar, so I

559
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:44,000
might have some sort of stream with her relating to that.

560
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:50,000
Uh, I use the shock collar for FaDempa.

561
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:56,000
Um, but yeah, my goals are pretty much.

562
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
I want to do a hundred days of my collabs with VTubers.

563
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
It's like a challenge for myself.

564
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:03,000
I like forcing myself to go talk to people.

565
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:06,000
Like, I was scared of Dempa, okay, but I DMed her first

566
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:10,000
because I'm a big girl and I was like, hi, I'm 20.

567
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:14,000
Uh, would you like to say, I was like, oh yeah, would you like to

568
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,000
collab with me?

569
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,000
She's like, fuck yeah, oh my god, that was so good.

570
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,000
So yeah, Dempa based.

571
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:23,000
Uh, yes, I'm going to put myself out there, talk to VTubers,

572
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:27,000
mingle a bit more because, um, I say my voice is cracked.

573
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:30,000
I said, well, actually you died zap, true.

574
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:35,000
Uh, everything else is explanatory.

575
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:38,000
Uh, I need to actually purchase the Lord of the Ring book,

576
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
we'll get there, we'll get there.

577
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:43,000
Okay, this I need help with.

578
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,000
Um, I actually genuinely need help.

579
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,000
I literally have, I don't know if you can hear that.

580
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:51,000
I have pen and paper to write down what you guys think.

581
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,000
I don't know what I'm doing.

582
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:56,000
Do I look like, do I look like I'm not smart?

583
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
Wait, hold on, let me write it down.

584
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:01,000
General, like, sorry, I'm going to look down every time I do this.

585
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:04,000
Art.

586
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:07,000
Old art.

587
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,000
Mean.

588
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:12,000
And obviously you flings or waflings.

589
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:16,000
Dempa is intimidating until you realize our tentacles can go.

590
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
Hmm.

591
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:24,000
You're so, so, so.

592
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
Keeping, keep them all as help.

593
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
Okay.

594
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
Strawing.

595
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
Oh, that's actually kind of cute.

596
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
Strawing.

597
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:40,000
Yeah, um, cuddle time.

598
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
Yeah, I'm, I'll Dempa, I'm with you.

599
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
Like, I just like straightforward stuff.

600
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:49,000
Gen, like, strong gen, strong gen, strong live, strong clip,

601
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:56,000
strong art, strong old art, strong meme.

602
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
Straw notes.

603
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:03,000
Straw notes would make sense.

604
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,000
Snort.

605
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:09,000
Snort, snort, snort, snort.

606
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:12,000
It's not like what, uh,

607
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:15,000
it's not like what a swan would say.

608
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,000
Snort.

609
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:22,000
Uh, general refers to, um, if you just want to say something,

610
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
like on Twitter, you use that,

611
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:27,000
and then, like, I'll read it with my eyeballs.

612
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,000
Straw live.

613
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,000
Straw live.

614
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:32,000
Honestly, my voice is cracking now.

615
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
I'm not gonna make it.

616
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,000
I can't believe it.

617
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,000
If I can debut and already did,

618
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:40,000
not even 24 hours later.

619
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:43,000
Strong lure.

620
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,000
I guess I said.

621
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,000
Ink time.

622
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,000
Oh my god, ink time.

623
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
Sorry, ink time for art.

624
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
That has to be, that's so good.

625
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,000
Ink time.

626
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,000
Ink time.

627
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
I like ink time.

628
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:57,000
Yeah, like a reaction tag.

629
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,000
Strong sea.

630
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,000
Oh!

631
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
Strong seas?

632
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
Like I see.

633
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
Strong leaks.

634
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,000
I think ink time is good.

635
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:10,000
Because ink myself is my,

636
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:14,000
my, my other catchphrase.

637
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
It's not catchphrase at all.

638
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:19,000
Strong memes.

639
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,000
Strong memes.

640
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,000
Stronetized.

641
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:25,000
Oh, let's do that.

642
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,000
The inking.

643
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,000
Anything.

644
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,000
Oh.

645
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,000
Sorry, I'm itching my eyeball.

646
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,000
Strong bad.

647
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
Oh god, I'm so bad at this.

648
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,000
Strong close.

649
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,000
I mean, just do what DEMPA said,

650
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,000
and just, like, strong gen,

651
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:41,000
strong live, strong this, strong that.

652
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,000
Ink time was used by a tattoo artist.

653
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,000
Man, tattoo artist out here,

654
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:48,000
ruining it for all of us.

655
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:51,000
We dafty, we dafty.

656
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,000
I inked myself.

657
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
Strong Sina.

658
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,000
Oh, that's actually really good.

659
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,000
Hold on.

660
00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:00,000
General text, strong Sina.

661
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:03,000
I'll just do one N.

662
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,000
That's so good.

663
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,000
I've seen you.

664
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,000
Strong Sina.

665
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,000
Strong sake.

666
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,000
No!

667
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,000
No, Vsake.

668
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
I'll never beat the Vsake allegation.

669
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
Be for yourself.

670
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:21,000
I think Street 4 would meet fans soon.

671
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,000
Mimire.

672
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,000
Mimire.

673
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:26,000
It sounds like Namorize.

674
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:29,000
And I have the memory of a goldfish.

675
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:30,000
Incredible.

676
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:33,000
I'll turn out funny.

677
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:34,000
Gen can be strong.

678
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
You know what?

679
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:41,000
Any mention of my absolutely horrific

680
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,000
Strawfish.

681
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,000
Stratustive.

682
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,000
Strawfish.

683
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,000
God, I'm so bad at this.

684
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,000
I'll think.

685
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
I'll need to freaking cook on it more.

686
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,000
I don't want to be stuck.

687
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,000
Smallfish.

688
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:57,000
Oh, smallfish is really good for all art.

689
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,000
Oh, yeah.

690
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,000
Smallfish.

691
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,000
I'm putting that down.

692
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:06,000
I hate when you have to like TTL.

693
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,000
E?

694
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:10,000
Oh, I did too many of them.

695
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,000
What's that?

696
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,000
I can't read it right properly.

697
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:16,000
Yet my entire career is based on it.

698
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,000
Hell yeah.

699
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
Okay, we'll move on.

700
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,000
I'll come back to it.

701
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,000
I'll cook a little on my own.

702
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:28,000
Obviously, Squishy Gold pretty much.

703
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:32,000
He did designs, lores.

704
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:35,000
There's actually full lores, Will.

705
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:39,000
I can't read it right now because my voice is perishing.

706
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:43,000
Um, what else?

707
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,000
Mascots.

708
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,000
All the mascots were made.

709
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:51,000
If you didn't know the reason,

710
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:54,000
I'll heal your throat with your tentacles, please.

711
00:33:54,000 --> 00:34:02,000
The reason why reeflings have a patch on their head

712
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:07,000
is a nicotine patch to help you with your addiction.

713
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:11,000
We have an addiction to each other.

714
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,000
So that's why you have a nicotine patch.

715
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,000
And you have lovely tentacles.

716
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:24,000
I've already got lots of suspicious artwork of us together,

717
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
but it's for November, so I can't post that.

718
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:29,000
Yeah, Tamachi absolutely cooked on the lores.

719
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:32,000
Background, yeah, I love my room.

720
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:35,000
Odd's Top was such a good sport.

721
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,000
I literally sent them a DM.

722
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:40,000
I'm like, hey, can you base it off of Sonic OST?

723
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:43,000
And he's like, yeah, sure.

724
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,000
Waltz with me.

725
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
He did my little banner that's on Twitter,

726
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
which is really good, absolutely.

727
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:54,000
Azura could help you all with her healing properties.

728
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,000
Oh really?

729
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,000
Yeah, Small Sushi, she did great.

730
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,000
Small Sushi actually, she did fantastic

731
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:08,000
because the girls weren't fully conceptualized

732
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000
when she created them.

733
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000
I basically just gave descriptions,

734
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
which was really rough.

735
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
I know you haven't seen my stingers

736
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:19,000
for my scene transitions.

737
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,000
I hate stingers.

738
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,000
I spent like $200,

739
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:27,000
and I don't even want to use them.

740
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:30,000
I bought it, obviously I bought it for everyone else,

741
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:33,000
but I'm like, why did I spend that money on me?

742
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,000
I don't like using stingers.

743
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,000
I just went straight into it.

744
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:40,000
And my loading screen was so expensive.

745
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:44,000
Actually, Umi cooked with the loading screen.

746
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:48,000
She's actually making another alternative version

747
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,000
because I had to do that cover-up thing.

748
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:54,000
But that was very expensive as well.

749
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,000
I just want to get in there.

750
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:59,000
And then obviously why I picked my gen.

751
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:02,000
That was so fun to do.

752
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:06,000
Everyone's like, oh, this is my first impression.

753
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
No, motherfucker.

754
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
I picked them.

755
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,000
Oh, so fun.

756
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:14,000
It was so fun being able to say that

757
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:18,000
and being like, yeah, yeah.

758
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000
Absolutely adored it.

759
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,000
Evil strongy be like, I always use stingers.

760
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,000
I love stingers.

761
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:30,000
I love when VTubers have 10 minutes of stream starting soon

762
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,000
at the start of their streams.

763
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,000
Perish, absolutely perish.

764
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,000
Nonsense.

765
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:38,000
I'm starting up on a brotherhood at the menu tomorrow.

766
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,000
Mark my words.

767
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,000
But yes.

768
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,000
It was just fantastic.

769
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:51,000
The girls, it's hard to judge people when they apply

770
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:55,000
because it just felt really...

771
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,000
weird.

772
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,000
Hold on.

773
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,000
Hold on.

774
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:09,000
Yeah, it felt weird trying to put them on

775
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:12,000
because some of them said put me on any model.

776
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:15,000
Some of them said I wanted a specific model.

777
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:18,000
I think Azura got who she wanted.

778
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,000
She be...

779
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
Hmm.

780
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:29,000
Mercy wanted AC.

781
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:32,000
AC wanted AC, so AC got AC.

782
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:35,000
Amy, did Amy say anyone?

783
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:41,000
Anyway, it's impossible to give people the outline

784
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:44,000
that they wanted because they couldn't even see it.

785
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,000
They couldn't even see it.

786
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
It was just an outline.

787
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:53,000
Did you have any awkward or weird applications?

788
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:59,000
Someone's intro video was 30 seconds.

789
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:02,000
For anyone watching, if you're serious about joining

790
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:07,000
a VTuber agency, what you're supposed to roughly do

791
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:11,000
in an application introduction video

792
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,000
is to say your accolades,

793
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,000
whatever you achieved as a streamer

794
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,000
prior to what you're doing now.

795
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:20,000
So you mention how often you stream.

796
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,000
Do you stream three times a week consistently?

797
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
Good thing to mention.

798
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,000
30 seconds.

799
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:30,000
It was like, hi, I'm...

800
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
and I stream on and that was it.

801
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:35,000
And I was like, bro, what am I supposed to do with that?

802
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,000
But yeah, you're supposed to say your accolades,

803
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,000
what you want to achieve within the agency,

804
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,000
is a good thing to mention.

805
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:47,000
You're also supposed to pass the test

806
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:50,000
where you say hi, Valor, at the start

807
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:53,000
because that means you read the instructions properly.

808
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:56,000
If you didn't start with hi, Valor,

809
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:59,000
I didn't close your application right away.

810
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:03,000
I gave you a chance, but it's kind of one of those tests

811
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:07,000
where those who did it, I know you read.

812
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:10,000
Those who didn't, either, you forgot.

813
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,000
Although I say that,

814
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:15,000
I mean, the girls have given me permission

815
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:18,000
to kind of talk about the thing.

816
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:21,000
Azura's application was unprofessional.

817
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:25,000
Fuck, I'm not even going to be around the bush with Azura.

818
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:28,000
She gave me permission to talk about it.

819
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:33,000
In her introduction, she was like, hey, I'm Azura.

820
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:36,000
And she was like, I really don't like pickles

821
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,000
and I don't like mustard.

822
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:42,000
And I was like, Azura, this is your introduction video.

823
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:45,000
You're supposed to tell me things you've achieved.

824
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:48,000
She's like, yeah, I don't like the taste of these certain foods.

825
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:51,000
And I was like, you're perfect for the hag, and you come.

826
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:54,000
You're perfect for the doting hag

827
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:57,000
that we've got no competition.

828
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:05,000
I say, doesn't even, English isn't even her first language.

829
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:11,000
She had the most professional application.

830
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:16,000
She had these massive paragraphs, serious answers.

831
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:19,000
Amy was a dafty.

832
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:23,000
She freaking forgot to edit one part of her application.

833
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:26,000
And in one of the answers,

834
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:29,000
she was like, I want to diddle the other girls.

835
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,000
And I'm like, I knew it was an oversight

836
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,000
because everything else was professional.

837
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:36,000
I'm like, any one earth have you put.

838
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:42,000
She failed the high vealure.

839
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:49,000
Mercy must have watched her introduction video

840
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:52,000
like 30 times over.

841
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:55,000
She was so like, she went above and beyond.

842
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:58,000
She actually created Icy.

843
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:02,000
Like recreated her outline and named her and all of that.

844
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:06,000
Pocha, Amy left that on purpose.

845
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,000
Yeah.

846
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:12,000
The introduction video gives me a very good hint

847
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,000
to what kind of beach over you are.

848
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,000
No, what kind of person you are

849
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,000
because there's one thing to stream,

850
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:22,000
but when you're talking directly to someone who's assessing you,

851
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,000
you act a bit different.

852
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:29,000
And yes, it was very interesting.

853
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:30,000
It was very interesting.

854
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,000
I got serenaded so much.

855
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,000
So I don't know why I'm frog blinking.

856
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:37,000
Let me just give me one second.

857
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:40,000
She's going to totally not recalibrate in the old mech.

858
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,000
Hold on.

859
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:49,000
That's very calibration.

860
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:53,000
Yeah, I got serenaded.

861
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:54,000
So many people were singing.

862
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,000
I'm like, you don't have to sing to be in this agency.

863
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:59,000
You just need to do one cover song of it.

864
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:01,000
I'm not going to force you to sing.

865
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:10,000
Probably one of the most frustrating things

866
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:14,000
was we asked to have streaming history

867
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:17,000
and people's evidence of being a streamer

868
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:20,000
was like a link to their Twitter and no other thing.

869
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:21,000
Oh no, content creator.

870
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:22,000
That was the terminology used.

871
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,000
You have to be a content creator.

872
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:27,000
And it was like, are you okay?

873
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:28,000
Why are you linking your Twitter?

874
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,000
Twitter isn't content.

875
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,000
There weren't even a v-tweet or anything like that.

876
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,000
And it was just like...

877
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:37,000
Are the girls doing more songs?

878
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:38,000
Yes, 100%.

879
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,000
If the girls want to pursue more singing,

880
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,000
they just come to me and tell me what they want to do.

881
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:45,000
And I get that she don't.

882
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,000
Well, other things.

883
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:53,000
Obviously, I'm not going to say anything private.

884
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:55,000
I'm very flattered.

885
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:58,000
There were some very big names that applied,

886
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,000
but they just weren't a good fit.

887
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,000
Or they already had a pre-established brand

888
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:05,000
and it was like, is this really what you want?

889
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:07,000
I think you just want to...

890
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:12,000
I think some people that were very high notoriety

891
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:15,000
were interested more in the manager side of things

892
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:19,000
than actually being at the other.

893
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:22,000
We had like one person who was fricking massive

894
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:25,000
and they were like, can I keep my IP and join you?

895
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:28,000
And I'm like, sorry.

896
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:31,000
I need to own the rights to the models

897
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:33,000
in order to do what we need to do.

898
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:34,000
Okay.

899
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:37,000
It was a shame,

900
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:39,000
because I'm sure that person would have done just fine,

901
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:45,000
but it's not possible to not have the IP

902
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:48,000
and utilize the girls.

903
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:52,000
Yes, it was in the facts on the page.

904
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:57,000
The website got so many fucking questions

905
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:59,000
that were answered on the website,

906
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:04,000
so they had to ignore the tab that had all the information

907
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:08,000
to go to the contact part of the website

908
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:11,000
to then ask the question,

909
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:14,000
that was already on the website.

910
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:20,000
Literally, I tried so hard to make that ship

911
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:23,000
be as comprehensible as possible.

912
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:32,000
Yes, I think the applicants definitely read through it all.

913
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:36,000
Reef time.

914
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:37,000
Oh, I can't say that.

915
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:38,000
Sorry, I'm not...

916
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,000
That's the code name.

917
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:41,000
I did not say that word.

918
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:43,000
Please don't get on me.

919
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:49,000
I'm just trying to think back

920
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:53,000
because there's anything notable on the applications.

921
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:55,000
Oh my God!

922
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:57,000
There was one application.

923
00:44:57,000 --> 00:45:00,000
She was outrageous.

924
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,000
Outrageous.

925
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:05,000
If you apply to an agency,

926
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:07,000
that agency watches your content.

927
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:10,000
This girl, my goodness,

928
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,000
she applied.

929
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:16,000
I went on her Twitch to listen to her live

930
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,000
to check her out and all of that.

931
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:23,000
She admitted in the next live stream,

932
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:26,000
oh, I'd only do Vialure for one year

933
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:30,000
and then bring my audience over to this account.

934
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:33,000
Why would you admit that out loud?

935
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:35,000
I'm very happy to see it.

936
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:37,000
I never even considered her,

937
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:40,000
but oh my God, how could you be so...

938
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:43,000
I don't even know what the word is.

939
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:45,000
I was gobsmacked.

940
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:47,000
I sent it to other members of the team

941
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:51,000
to make sure I heard what I heard was correct.

942
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:53,000
But they outright said,

943
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:56,000
yeah, I would just do it for one year

944
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:58,000
and then bring my audience over.

945
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:02,000
Dog.

946
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:05,000
Thank God I didn't waste.

947
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:08,000
Waste a slot for you.

948
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:12,000
I am very happy to say that all current talents

949
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:15,000
have given very high indications

950
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:17,000
of staying at the agency, you know,

951
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:21,000
as long as income is all good and dandy.

952
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:23,000
So please do support them via Patreon

953
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:26,000
or monetization streams when the girls get monetized.

954
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:29,000
But yes, I was absolutely gobsmacked.

955
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:32,000
One to even apply to do it in the first place

956
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:34,000
knowing you have no commitment,

957
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:37,000
knowing that we're like 80, 20 split,

958
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:39,000
everything's in your favor, 100% merch,

959
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:44,000
and saying that you're not even going to be, like, dedicated.

960
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:45,000
Oh my God.

961
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:48,000
And then to admit it,

962
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,000
to admit it,

963
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,000
knowing you submitted yourself and the agency

964
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,000
is watching over you.

965
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:58,000
Oh my God.

966
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,000
Absolutely gobsmacked.

967
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,000
Oh.

968
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,000
Anyway,

969
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,000
I will repeat again,

970
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,000
I am very happy to say that all girls

971
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:13,000
have given indications of long-term commitment,

972
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:15,000
if you will.

973
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:17,000
And as well as,

974
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:19,000
if they sign on for one more year,

975
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:21,000
like another year,

976
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:24,000
the split goes 85 to them,

977
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,000
15 to the agency,

978
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:29,000
and they also get an alternative outfit on us.

979
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:32,000
They do not pay for it, we pay for it.

980
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:35,000
I'm glad she was honest, I didn't waste her time.

981
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:37,000
She was honest in her stream,

982
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:40,000
she was not honest on her application form,

983
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:43,000
to fill all of that out in mislead and be like,

984
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:45,000
I'm just going to quit after a year,

985
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:47,000
just go,

986
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:49,000
I actually spat in real life

987
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:51,000
and that landed on my phone.

988
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:54,000
Don't do that, don't fuck with me.

989
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:57,000
I put a lot of love into this.

990
00:47:57,000 --> 00:48:00,000
Women lie, I can't believe it, that's terrible.

991
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,000
You know you can't say that,

992
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:04,000
that's the concept artist by the way,

993
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,000
don't believe the thing that comes out of his mouth.

994
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,000
I'm jealous of the phone.

995
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:11,000
I didn't know she was going to do that bit

996
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:14,000
on her debut, where she was like,

997
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:17,000
I gasped, I was like, oh my god.

998
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:19,000
Just so you guys know,

999
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:21,000
I didn't have anything to do with her debuts,

1000
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:23,000
they all did it themselves.

1001
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:26,000
I was like, oh my god.

1002
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,000
Anyway,

1003
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:30,000
oh,

1004
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:33,000
2.0's over, right, show's over folks.

1005
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:36,000
Um,

1006
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:39,000
I'm a bit jealous.

1007
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:41,000
Right, I'm going to open up Marshmallow

1008
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:43,000
because this time I can answer a question.

1009
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:45,000
Please keep my UKatha on.

1010
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:47,000
I don't know what letter did it,

1011
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:49,000
but I can actually answer Marshmallows that are,

1012
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:51,000
um,

1013
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:53,000
why are you so cute? Stop it,

1014
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:55,000
my voice is so freaking broken.

1015
00:48:57,000 --> 00:49:00,000
Have you considered streaming elsewhere?

1016
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:05,000
Yes, the girls are allowed to stream on an alternative website

1017
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:06,000
at a later date.

1018
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:07,000
Please understand,

1019
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:09,000
we are trying to establish yourself on YouTube at first,

1020
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:11,000
and we have monetization on YouTube,

1021
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:13,000
and the girls' income is all sorted.

1022
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:15,000
But yes, there are plans.

1023
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:18,000
I will make it free access.

1024
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:25,000
I do not believe in charging any further

1025
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:27,000
than, um,

1026
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:31,000
YouTube membership and Patreons all together

1027
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:35,000
at $9.99 for your OSHI desk to support,

1028
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:39,000
because it is $1.99 for emotes

1029
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:42,000
to make sure no one gets gifted membership.

1030
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:45,000
And then is it $4.99, or is it $3.99?

1031
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:50,000
My voice is broken.

1032
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:53,000
Is it $4.99 for membership?

1033
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:56,000
Usually.

1034
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:59,000
Is $4.99, yeah, $4.99 seen agreeable.

1035
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:01,000
Okay, $1.99 for tier one, $4.99.

1036
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:03,000
Yeah, that sounds right, that sounds right.

1037
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:05,000
Um, as long as you guys don't think it's outrageous,

1038
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:07,000
like in this day and age.

1039
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:10,000
Um, as I've said in the Veil or Smoothstream,

1040
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:13,000
we are undercutting the market.

1041
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:16,000
Um, I'm not even going to pretend otherwise.

1042
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:18,000
On the VA side of things,

1043
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:22,000
most VA's start at $10 for two exclusive audios.

1044
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:24,000
We are undercutting the market by doing

1045
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:26,000
four audios for $5.

1046
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:29,000
And no price increase at all is planned.

1047
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:31,000
And if you feel ever so inclined,

1048
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:34,000
you can donate more via, donate.

1049
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:36,000
You can support more via Patreon.

1050
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:42,000
There is a secondary tier that is $20, I believe.

1051
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:45,000
I haven't put anything else in place.

1052
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:48,000
Um, yes.

1053
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:51,000
What's your history with hypnosis?

1054
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:53,000
I'm learning, I'm a new baby.

1055
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:56,000
Um, but I'm going to give it my best shot.

1056
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:59,000
I have a very deep interest in it.

1057
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:03,000
I've just never actually made content about it, like, straight up.

1058
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:06,000
It's not expensive, yes, I...

1059
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:16,000
Oh, I really, I've heard some stories

1060
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:21,000
around that it was going to be $5 for standard and $20.

1061
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:24,000
Oh, no, no, we're undercutting the market.

1062
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:29,000
$5 and you get four, four audios per month.

1063
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:33,000
Um, are you concerned undercutting could cause a scene?

1064
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:35,000
Wide price shift downwards?

1065
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:39,000
No, because prices are going up everywhere.

1066
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:45,000
Um, following the voice actress trends

1067
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:49,000
and the ASMR side of things and the role play side of things,

1068
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:52,000
prices are only going up and I believe in the opposite.

1069
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:56,000
I believe in delivering both quality and quantity.

1070
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:59,000
Um, without overworking the girls, please understand

1071
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:05,000
that management have dictated the scripts for a couple of months.

1072
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:09,000
However, there's few girls interested in writing their scripts.

1073
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:12,000
I'm also very open to writing scripts live.

1074
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:14,000
Unfortunately, there will be a membership stream.

1075
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:18,000
For me, content-wise, to give you guys exactly what you're looking for.

1076
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:22,000
Um, but please understand, I cannot pigeonhole the girls

1077
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:25,000
into doing the same thing over and over again.

1078
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:29,000
Just rehashed, that's not, that's not, um,

1079
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:33,000
that is no way for them to be set up for success.

1080
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:37,000
That is, they will be set up for failure, sadly, if I did that

1081
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:39,000
and I really hope, uh, yeah.

1082
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:41,000
Have you written any scripts yet?

1083
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:43,000
Yeah, you listened to them.

1084
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:47,000
Everything that's out right now on Patreon is done by me.

1085
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:53,000
The two other script writers kick in, I want to say roughly in three months

1086
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:59,000
and then the manager for the scripts is about to kick in.

1087
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:05,000
I don't know quite what's happening yet, if they'll write the majority.

1088
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:11,000
Um, this is just my humble opinion, but because I don't have...

1089
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:19,000
My scripts do not come out as best as if a man had written it.

1090
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:21,000
That's just my opinion.

1091
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:26,000
Um, the Emmy has shown interest in a script,

1092
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:29,000
Shibi has shown interest in writing.

1093
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:32,000
I think Azura prefers the help.

1094
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:37,000
Azura, um, I think she needs reassurance.

1095
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:42,000
AC is good at improv.

1096
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:46,000
Uh, I think she may do some improv scripts in the future.

1097
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:48,000
Uh, yes.

1098
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:53,000
What is the adult aspect to the agency?

1099
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:59,000
Uh, the alternate, alt-twitters and, uh, Patreon.

1100
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:01,000
Yeah.

1101
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:03,000
Azura did good.

1102
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:05,000
She did.

1103
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:10,000
I eventually want to be a member for all the girls who girls deserve their fans.

1104
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:13,000
Uh, yeah, I'll kind of repeat this.

1105
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:17,000
If you, like, are in a position where you can support, like, one girl,

1106
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:22,000
please think about supporting the other girls over me.

1107
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:27,000
Um, I am living a very good life, um, and things are going very well.

1108
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:30,000
Please don't worry about me, okay?

1109
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:36,000
How do you find the alternate of twitters?

1110
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:39,000
Check who they're following?

1111
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:42,000
Yeah, check who they're following.

1112
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:44,000
Question about your design.

1113
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:46,000
How did you come up with the twin tails?

1114
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:48,000
And the candy piece is seashells!

1115
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:51,000
I'm a cuttlefish, I'm a sea beacherber.

1116
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:56,000
Uh, these are cuttlefish, uh, sorry, these are seashells.

1117
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:59,000
Uh, and then I got double bunches.

1118
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:04,000
Um, I love symmetrical hair, and I love bunches, so I got double bunches.

1119
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:14,000
Um, would you be open to accepting script submissions?

1120
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:17,000
Absolutely, I don't know how to set it up, I don't know how to do it,

1121
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:21,000
and I don't know, I need, I would need to, like, give a guide,

1122
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:31,000
because it's quite hard behind the scenes to get it all efficient and good to go, but yeah.

1123
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:33,000
Definitely open to it.

1124
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:37,000
Please do let us cook though, like, literally the dust is settling,

1125
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:41,000
the girls are about to start doing game streams after these 2.0s.

1126
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:48,000
Um, the first week I did request the girls to stream as much as they're physically able to

1127
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:53,000
without cancelling streams, I have emphasised to them that cancelling streams,

1128
00:55:53,000 --> 00:56:01,000
try your best to not over promise, it's better to take a day off than it is to

1129
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:06,000
um, plan a stream that you think you can do and then you get too tired and cancel it,

1130
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:13,000
because cancelling streams is very, people plan, people plan their time and their days

1131
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:16,000
and their energy around a stream if they know what time it's coming on,

1132
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:21,000
and it's very valuable to respect people's time.

1133
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:26,000
So, like, for reeflings, for example, you guys know that I don't stop streaming,

1134
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:32,000
like, at all, and I'm always there, and I literally have never cancelled a stream, so.

1135
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:35,000
And that's true, I haven't cancelled a stream.

1136
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:38,000
Mm-mm.

1137
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:42,000
Um, sorry to tie it, just to bring the topic back.

1138
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:45,000
Gifted membership is the one that's closest to $5, yeah.

1139
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:47,000
You may have to go higher.

1140
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:50,000
Eh, eto?

1141
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:56,000
I thought gifted membership went to the lowest tier, tier one was gonna be emotes only,

1142
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:59,000
and then tier two was gonna be $4.99.

1143
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:02,000
Ah, I really don't wanna overcharge.

1144
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:04,000
So there is gonna...

1145
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:12,000
Well, wait, more streams?

1146
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:14,000
Yeah, I stream all day every day, baby.

1147
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:17,000
Just make it an extra dollar.

1148
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:20,000
Eh, it's expensive though, it's expensive.

1149
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:22,000
Eh, who goes there?

1150
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:24,000
By the Pope.

1151
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:25,000
Identify yourself.

1152
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:28,000
Um...

1153
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:52,000
I literally said in the interview, you're not gonna get in trouble, I'm not your mum.

1154
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:54,000
I couldn't give less than two shits what you do.

1155
00:57:54,000 --> 00:58:00,000
I basically said the only thing I ask you not to do is release any NDA content,

1156
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:06,000
and, you know, don't say the N word.

1157
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:08,000
You know, basic adult stuff.

1158
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:10,000
It's pretty much it.

1159
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:13,000
I mean, I don't know what else to tell you.

1160
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:16,000
When you treat adults like adults, they act like adults.

1161
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:17,000
It's crazy.

1162
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:25,000
Did you hypnotize the girls to become the characters?

1163
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:30,000
Eh, I hope you're drinking a lot of soda.

1164
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:31,000
Ah, I'm going cola.

1165
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:33,000
It's fizzy juice, actually.

1166
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:34,000
Sorry, you're turning Scots.

1167
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:37,000
It's not soda, it's fizzy juice.

1168
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:40,000
Um, yes.

1169
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:48,000
As for repercussions, like I said, we don't do suspensions.

1170
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:50,000
However, I did warn them.

1171
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:52,000
I said, doesn't mean you're allowed free reign.

1172
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:55,000
Like, we can cut, we can terminate.

1173
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:57,000
Obviously, we don't want to do that.

1174
00:58:57,000 --> 00:59:00,000
And no girl has given any indication of any of that shit.

1175
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:02,000
Thank God.

1176
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:04,000
I have full faith in these girls.

1177
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:05,000
I've known them for two months now.

1178
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:06,000
No issues.

1179
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:08,000
Not one issue has popped up.

1180
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:15,000
Oh, yeah, fizzy juice is how you say it in Scotland.

1181
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:18,000
Are you a hire up in the agency?

1182
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:19,000
No.

1183
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:21,000
I said, don't call me boss.

1184
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:28,000
I basically got their script started,

1185
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:30,000
but it's going to a script manager.

1186
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:32,000
And I don't have to do any work.

1187
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:34,000
I get to stream all day long.

1188
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:37,000
Um...

1189
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:43,000
Yeah, someone kind of asked about Gentoo.

1190
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:45,000
A year away, bro.

1191
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:46,000
A year away.

1192
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:48,000
Do you plan on doing movie watch alongs?

1193
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:50,000
Absolutely.

1194
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:52,000
Well, you ever do a deep sea creature list?

1195
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:54,000
Oh my God, yeah, that's so good.

1196
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:55,000
That's a good idea.

1197
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:56,000
I like that.

1198
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:58,000
I was going to...

1199
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:00,000
So this is a failed stream idea.

1200
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:03,000
I was actually going to order, like, a cuttlefish.

1201
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:05,000
It wouldn't be alive,

1202
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:07,000
but I wanted to explore the biology of it

1203
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:09,000
because I think they're pretty cool.

1204
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:11,000
Like cephalopods are pretty cool.

1205
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:13,000
And I wanted to, like, show you guys, like,

1206
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:14,000
there's a thing.

1207
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:16,000
If I was a cuttlefish, I'd say, look, looks good.

1208
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:18,000
But I think people would find it a bit more

1209
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:20,000
that I'm, like, essentially playing with a dead body.

1210
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:21,000
So...

1211
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:23,000
Yeah, probably can do that.

1212
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:26,000
I've not played Subnautica.

1213
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:28,000
I don't have a memory of playing it.

1214
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:32,000
Could give it a good shot.

1215
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:34,000
I could recommend it.

1216
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:39,000
But it's for science.

1217
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:42,000
Cephalopog!

1218
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:44,000
For memes?

1219
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:46,000
For memes?

1220
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:47,000
Cephalopog.

1221
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:48,000
Sorry.

1222
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:49,000
My tag now,

1223
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:51,000
as long as no one's yoinked it.

1224
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:52,000
Hold on, hold on.

1225
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:54,000
Let me scroll up so I can see the spelling.

1226
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:58,000
Thank you!

1227
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:00,000
Yoinkers!

1228
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:02,000
My tag now!

1229
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:04,000
Which tags are missing?

1230
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:06,000
I've got strong Sina for general.

1231
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:08,000
I've got smuttlefish for all

1232
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:10,000
and cephalopog for memes.

1233
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:13,000
So I need live clips and art.

1234
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:18,000
Cracked it.

1235
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:21,000
Literally didn't even have to come up with it myself.

1236
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:23,000
What a genius.

1237
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:26,000
Hee hee.

1238
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:29,000
Let me refresh my...

1239
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:31,000
I scroll down a bit, actually.

1240
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:44,000
As long as they're respectful,

1241
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:46,000
I'll actually use it for educational content.

1242
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:48,000
Yeah, I like biology,

1243
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:51,000
but I think people find it quite morbid sometimes.

1244
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:55,000
I don't want to upset anyone.

1245
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:58,000
I can't believe you're already taking advantage of me.

1246
01:01:58,000 --> 01:01:59,000
True.

1247
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:01,000
You like it, really?

1248
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:04,000
I've missed taking advantage of you.

1249
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:06,000
What a refund.

1250
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:12,000
Tentacles.

1251
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:14,000
I don't have any tentacles.

1252
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:18,000
I may get tentacles another time,

1253
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:20,000
but I don't have tentacles.

1254
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:22,000
I feel like if I had tentacles,

1255
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:24,000
they would come out with my...

1256
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:27,000
I'll be honest,

1257
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:29,000
I don't think they would be tailbone attached.

1258
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:32,000
I think they would come out with my other end.

1259
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:41,000
Out of all the girls,

1260
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:44,000
who do you think is going to overwork themselves for Sheebie?

1261
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:47,000
Sheebie's already done so much work in advance,

1262
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:49,000
so she can focus on streams.

1263
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:51,000
Um...

1264
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:02,000
The tentacles not be around you.

1265
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:12,000
Oh my god, someone took the Scottish coffee pasta.

1266
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:15,000
What do you think of that, Mr. Pajama wearing

1267
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:18,000
basket face, slipper wielding...

1268
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:19,000
I hate...

1269
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:22,000
The only thing I don't like about Marshmallow

1270
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:25,000
is that it cuts words in the middle.

1271
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:26,000
Like...

1272
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:29,000
Tentacles.

1273
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:31,000
Ooh, that became cool.

1274
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:34,000
Do any of the girls have any talents,

1275
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:36,000
which is a surprise to you?

1276
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:38,000
Emmy, please, piano for real, for real.

1277
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:40,000
Um...

1278
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:43,000
Mercy...

1279
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:45,000
has acting.

1280
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:47,000
Um...

1281
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:51,000
Is there a draw?

1282
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:53,000
Sheebie actually draws as well,

1283
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:55,000
and Mercy and Emmy,

1284
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:57,000
and A.C. Doodle.

1285
01:03:57,000 --> 01:03:59,000
Um...

1286
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:01,000
I think they all draw,

1287
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:03,000
and I'm like, fuck Nella.

1288
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:05,000
These are all talents, and what do I do?

1289
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:07,000
I just sound like a backpipe.

1290
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:11,000
Hipstone, like, that's good.

1291
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:13,000
Um...

1292
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:16,000
Will the talents keep their silver playbots?

1293
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:18,000
Of course, Jesus, why would I keep that?

1294
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:20,000
That's disgusting.

1295
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:22,000
Absolute disgusting behaviour.

1296
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:24,000
All their hard work, and I keep the playbutton.

1297
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:26,000
Absolutely not.

1298
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:33,000
Oh my God, someone said an hour ago,

1299
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:35,000
when will auditions be open for Gen 2?

1300
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:37,000
I am hot and ready like a little

1301
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:39,000
Caesar's Pizza.

1302
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:42,000
Come and scoop me up before a rich man does.

1303
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:45,000
I've spotted an American...

1304
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:47,000
Bevin' on.

1305
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:49,000
Um...

1306
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:51,000
Mimi on reflex.

1307
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:53,000
Oh my God, I need to make a reflex...

1308
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:55,000
post...

1309
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:57,000
on my alternate arm.

1310
01:04:57,000 --> 01:04:59,000
My voice is so loud.

1311
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:02,000
Mummy, thank you for giving me a little sister.

1312
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:05,000
You talked prior during the selection process

1313
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:07,000
about keeping a list...

1314
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:10,000
a list of possible candidates,

1315
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:13,000
so I got my first choice for everyone.

1316
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:15,000
I don't know how,

1317
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:17,000
but everyone was like first choice pick.

1318
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:19,000
I wanted them in the agency, they came in the agency.

1319
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:21,000
There were...

1320
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:23,000
I would say like...

1321
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:25,000
eight people...

1322
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:27,000
that were like...

1323
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:29,000
all back.

1324
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:31,000
Obviously Azura didn't have one,

1325
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:33,000
that was a problem.

1326
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:35,000
Emmy, I was actually really worried

1327
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:37,000
she wouldn't accept her board.

1328
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:41,000
She likes it.

1329
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:46,000
I was worried that she wouldn't accept the board.

1330
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:49,000
And she was like, yeah, that's fine, I don't care.

1331
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:51,000
I was like, okay, then jeez, jeez.

1332
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:53,000
I was worried she wouldn't accept that.

1333
01:05:57,000 --> 01:05:59,000
Have any Japanese carpo's influenced

1334
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:01,000
your decision making?

1335
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:03,000
Why do you believe there was

1336
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:05,000
no lid one before?

1337
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:09,000
No idea.

1338
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:11,000
Probably because

1339
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:13,000
you need someone who's done it

1340
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:15,000
before to even understand

1341
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:17,000
what to do.

1342
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:19,000
A lot of guy owned corporations

1343
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:21,000
in the nicest way,

1344
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:23,000
most likely haven't been streamers before

1345
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:25,000
and don't comprehend what you're asking

1346
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:27,000
people to do.

1347
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:29,000
I kind of spoke about this a wee bit

1348
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:31,000
in the last stream.

1349
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:33,000
That 80-20 split,

1350
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:35,000
in order to motivate people,

1351
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:37,000
you have to let them earn what they're worth.

1352
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:39,000
If you turn around and say to them,

1353
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:41,000
for every $100

1354
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:43,000
you're getting

1355
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:45,000
20 bucks out of it, you're getting 50 bucks out of it,

1356
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:47,000
all that girl

1357
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:49,000
is going to be doing is sitting there

1358
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:51,000
saying, oh wow,

1359
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:53,000
I could have made the full 100 on my alt account.

1360
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:55,000
Oh wow, I could have done this on my previous life.

1361
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:57,000
That's all that they're going to sit there

1362
01:06:57,000 --> 01:06:59,000
and think.

1363
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:03,000
We're talking pure business, baby.

1364
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:05,000
I'm happy to talk pure business if you want.

1365
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:10,000
Well, the monthly audio releases

1366
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:12,000
be revealed before the month starts.

1367
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:14,000
Yes, we need to

1368
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:16,000
get on top of that.

1369
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:18,000
Sadly, there was a few issues

1370
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:20,000
production wise

1371
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:22,000
with a few things.

1372
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:24,000
Surprise, surprise, turns out,

1373
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:26,000
takes a lot of time to make these things happen.

1374
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:28,000
Love artists, but my fucking god,

1375
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:30,000
can you not go over deadlines?

1376
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:32,000
That'd be great.

1377
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:35,000
But yes, we

1378
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:37,000
will be posting monthly

1379
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:39,000
what the tags are,

1380
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:41,000
what the title is.

1381
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:43,000
We just need to catch up.

1382
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:45,000
You need to give us time to breathe.

1383
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:47,000
I'm so sorry, all I can ask is your patience.

1384
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:49,000
Unironically, bow emoji

1385
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:51,000
because

1386
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:53,000
we need time.

1387
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:55,000
It was absolutely hectic

1388
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:57,000
on debut.

1389
01:07:57,000 --> 01:07:59,000
We were exhausted in that group collab

1390
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:01,000
and

1391
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:03,000
I don't know if you recognise

1392
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:05,000
how fast we ended.

1393
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:07,000
I was like, right, say bye to chat, bye.

1394
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:09,000
We all

1395
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:11,000
disappeared out of that voice call so quickly.

1396
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:13,000
I was like, thank you guys so much.

1397
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:15,000
I'm going to wait a pass out.

1398
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:17,000
And then I ended up being really sick after it.

1399
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:19,000
But yes,

1400
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:21,000
we just need things to calm down.

1401
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:23,000
We're going to ease into the first week.

1402
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:25,000
Everyone's got their games. You get to see their personalities

1403
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:27,000
more, enjoy them more, which is fantastic.

1404
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:29,000
We know that.

1405
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:31,000
And

1406
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:33,000
octopus.

1407
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:35,000
I'm not an octopus.

1408
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:37,000
I'm a cod-o-fish.

1409
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:39,000
No call me octopus.

1410
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:41,000
No call me squid.

1411
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:43,000
I'm a cephalopod

1412
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:45,000
or a cod-o-fish.

1413
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:47,000
Better take your yourselves.

1414
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:49,000
And now the things have calmed down.

1415
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:51,000
The lead up to debut is very nerve-wracking.

1416
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:53,000
Like, very, very nerve-wracking.

1417
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:57,000
I have finished my cola.

1418
01:08:57,000 --> 01:08:59,000
I will now start on

1419
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:01,000
my warble.

1420
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:09,000
Astronaut, you're so friggin...

1421
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:11,000
Hey, you like my teeth?

1422
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:13,000
Is that what I was doing it for you?

1423
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:19,000
I think I've caught up a little bit.

1424
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:21,000
I don't know.

1425
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:23,000
I lied.

1426
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:25,000
Is there a reason you went with YouTube over Twitch?

1427
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:27,000
Yes, I can manage the girls' accounts from YouTube.

1428
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:29,000
I cannot manage the girls' accounts from Twitch.

1429
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:31,000
I can't do a thing on Twitch,

1430
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:33,000
management-wise.

1431
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:35,000
And

1432
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:37,000
Twitch, unfortunately,

1433
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:39,000
are very sparse and arbitrary

1434
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:41,000
when they

1435
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:43,000
throw the old ban hammer down

1436
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:45,000
or suspension hammer down.

1437
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:47,000
Really not a fan of Twitch doing that.

1438
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:49,000
Every week you see

1439
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:51,000
a girl being like, Twitch with a heck.

1440
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:53,000
I'm literally doing everything

1441
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:55,000
that everyone...

1442
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:57,000
I'm doing stuff that everyone else does.

1443
01:09:57,000 --> 01:09:59,000
Like, it just...

1444
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:01,000
At least with YouTube,

1445
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:03,000
you can beg them on Twitter

1446
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:05,000
for help or whatever.

1447
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:07,000
Twitch is inconsistent, yeah.

1448
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:09,000
Let's see.

1449
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:11,000
Would you dominate

1450
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:13,000
Inkling?

1451
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:15,000
I've never played Splatoon.

1452
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:17,000
Isn't it actually good?

1453
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:19,000
It's probably the most lore-friendly

1454
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:21,000
game for me to play.

1455
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:25,000
How does managing accounts...

1456
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:27,000
Yeah, so I have a...

1457
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:29,000
It sounds really bad, but I don't do anything

1458
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:31,000
on their accounts, but

1459
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:33,000
I can basically go on their accounts

1460
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:35,000
and set up streams for them

1461
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:37,000
or approve comments for them.

1462
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:41,000
Anything they want to help out, really.

1463
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:43,000
Now that

1464
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:45,000
debuts have happened, the girls are

1465
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:47,000
going to be controlling all that stuff.

1466
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:49,000
They'll be doing their live streams and stuff,

1467
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:51,000
but in order to reduce as much

1468
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:53,000
stress as possible on the girls,

1469
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:55,000
I pretty much try to do every single

1470
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:57,000
little thing, but

1471
01:10:57,000 --> 01:10:59,000
now that we're past the debut stage,

1472
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:01,000
they're going to have to be big girls

1473
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:03,000
now and, you know,

1474
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:05,000
put up their little games,

1475
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:07,000
put up their streams

1476
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:09,000
and all that and update their description.

1477
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:11,000
Like, I was the one doing

1478
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:13,000
all that behind the scenes.

1479
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:17,000
Have you played Pokémon? Yeah, Pokémon Ruby.

1480
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:19,000
My childhood game.

1481
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:21,000
Um...

1482
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:23,000
Mudkip was my starter.

1483
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:25,000
They have to spread their big girl wings.

1484
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:27,000
Yes, I like putting a message in the

1485
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:29,000
Discord. I'm like, I'm so sorry girls,

1486
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:31,000
but the hand holding kind of

1487
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:33,000
slows down now.

1488
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:35,000
Um...

1489
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:37,000
Oh yeah.

1490
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:39,000
Say hello out.

1491
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:41,000
It was torturing.

1492
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:43,000
Blaziken is so strong

1493
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:45,000
and so is Mudkip. Mudkip's really strong

1494
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:47,000
as well.

1495
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:49,000
Mudkip's always used in speedruns

1496
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:51,000
for Pokémon Ruby or Emerald.

1497
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:53,000
She doesn't know

1498
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:55,000
I want to collect her ink. Oh my god.

1499
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:57,000
Inks on you.

1500
01:11:57,000 --> 01:11:59,000
Strony is mum a bird, but it's time for them to flee the nest.

1501
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:01,000
Honestly, like,

1502
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:03,000
um, I hope

1503
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:05,000
overall they feel like less stressed.

1504
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:07,000
Like, um...

1505
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:09,000
They didn't have to think

1506
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:11,000
about the lures or what they wanted to say.

1507
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:13,000
Everything was edited on their behalf.

1508
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:15,000
Like, they had to give the audios over,

1509
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:17,000
everything was done on their behalf.

1510
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:19,000
Because like, I've heard stories

1511
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:21,000
of, like, other

1512
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:23,000
agencies, like,

1513
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:25,000
go to the talent, right, make up your lure.

1514
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:27,000
We've ordered all the art, but you make up the lure, by the way.

1515
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:29,000
And it's like, what?

1516
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:31,000
You literally are handing me the model. What do you mean you've not

1517
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:33,000
thought this stuff? And it was like, quick

1518
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:35,000
come up with a description of your character really quickly,

1519
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:37,000
quickly, quick, quick!

1520
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:39,000
And it's like, what?

1521
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:41,000
You're giving me the model.

1522
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:43,000
What do you mean I come up with this stuff?

1523
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:45,000
Like, that's the whole point of the model, unless it would be customized?

1524
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:47,000
Like, it's just like, fuck.

1525
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:49,000
Um...

1526
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:51,000
How did you

1527
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:53,000
end up managing them? Or are you new to the agency?

1528
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:55,000
Well, I'm new to being a manager. I'm not even their manager.

1529
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:57,000
I'm just a streamer that does it alongside them.

1530
01:12:57,000 --> 01:12:59,000
I just picked them!

1531
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:01,000
But, but me?

1532
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:03,000
Me? Nah, I'm on Assassin's Creed.

1533
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:05,000
I'm fucking being a boss. I ain't doing

1534
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:07,000
shit.

1535
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:09,000
Um...

1536
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:11,000
Yeah.

1537
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:13,000
Um...

1538
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:15,000
I know this isn't...

1539
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:17,000
Someone said it! Someone said say

1540
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:19,000
Purple Burglar Alarm! Got it!

1541
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:21,000
I knew someone was going to say it. I always

1542
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:23,000
get asked this. Right.

1543
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:25,000
So in my, like, clear accent,

1544
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:27,000
I say Purple Burglar Alarm.

1545
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:29,000
But if I say it in a harsh Scottish accent,

1546
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:31,000
Purple Burglar Alarm?

1547
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:33,000
Like, my tongue gets caught

1548
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:35,000
on the top of the roof of my mouth. Wait, I'll mute

1549
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:37,000
my background music so you can really hear it.

1550
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:39,000
My tongue gets caught.

1551
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:41,000
Purple Burglar Alarm?

1552
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:43,000
Like, ooh!

1553
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:45,000
Purple Burglar Alarm?

1554
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:47,000
You can hear my tongue getting caught.

1555
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:49,000
Say it, huh?

1556
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:51,000
Hmm...

1557
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:53,000
Uh-uh...

1558
01:13:55,000 --> 01:13:57,000
Sorry, Paul.

1559
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:01,000
Uh...

1560
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:05,000
What did you miss? Nothing.

1561
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:07,000
It's just me memein' about...

1562
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:09,000
Are you all trying to keep non-conflicting

1563
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:11,000
schedules? Sadly, it's not

1564
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:13,000
possible when someone like me is on the team.

1565
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:15,000
Um, so whenever

1566
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:17,000
a gen mate of mine goes

1567
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:19,000
live, I will highly recommend

1568
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:21,000
you go watch them. Cause right now, for example,

1569
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:23,000
Shiba Cottenbom is live doing her 2.0.

1570
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:25,000
Uh, Azura is coming

1571
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:27,000
on in roughly three hours.

1572
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:29,000
Um, but sadly

1573
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:31,000
I am an endurance streamer

1574
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:33,000
and the best time slot that I have selected

1575
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:35,000
means that I can go to doctors' appointments

1576
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:37,000
even if I do. Um... No, I'm not dying!

1577
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:39,000
Before anyone freaking types that

1578
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:41,000
I'm fine, my health is good.

1579
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:43,000
Um...

1580
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:45,000
Uh, it's all good. Don't worry.

1581
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:47,000
Um, but the time slot

1582
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:49,000
I have chosen means that I can still go out

1583
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:51,000
to do things like go shoppin

1584
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:53,000
or to a doctor's appointment

1585
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:55,000
or, um,

1586
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:57,000
you know, go feed gammy, you know how it is.

1587
01:14:57,000 --> 01:14:59,000
I'm not dying!

1588
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:01,000
Stop! My health is so much better.

1589
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:03,000
Although I do have a sad story.

1590
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:05,000
I mean, I won't say it in 2.0

1591
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:07,000
even though it's just

1592
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:09,000
our wealth.

1593
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:11,000
Nah, nah, I'll keep it to myself cause it's a bit sad

1594
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:13,000
and I don't want to make you guys sad.

1595
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:15,000
Like, this is such a good happy time. Like, holy fuck, we're back.

1596
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:17,000
Um, after a year

1597
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:19,000
goddamn, that took so long to cook!

1598
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:21,000
But we're here!

1599
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:23,000
Strongly cut.

1600
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:25,000
Me, that's just my name.

1601
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:27,000
Admitted, that's just my name.

1602
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:29,000
Um...

1603
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:31,000
But yeah, sadly I am an

1604
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:33,000
Endurance streamer which means

1605
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:35,000
weekly I will most likely have very long streams

1606
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:37,000
that are not

1607
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:39,000
friendly to the majority of viewers.

1608
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:41,000
Please understand, do not feel

1609
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:43,000
bad.

1610
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:45,000
If you are unable to watch me

1611
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:47,000
live.

1612
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:49,000
The other girls

1613
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:51,000
might be much more accessible to you

1614
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:53,000
time zone wise or stream wise.

1615
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:55,000
I can still hear her

1616
01:15:55,000 --> 01:15:57,000
fuck!

1617
01:15:57,000 --> 01:15:59,000
But I play, I absolutely

1618
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:01,000
do not feel insulted at all

1619
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:03,000
if you cannot

1620
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:05,000
you know, keep up with me.

1621
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:07,000
I'm not very friendly, my time zone

1622
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:09,000
isn't friendly, I am aware of that.

1623
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:11,000
And cause I'm an Endurance streamer, like, tomorrow's stream

1624
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:13,000
is literally

1625
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:15,000
8 hours long.

1626
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:17,000
I'm not even kidding. We're doing the full play

1627
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:19,000
through of Assassin's Creed Brotherhood

1628
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:21,000
and then we're going back to 100% it

1629
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:23,000
cause I've never 100%

1630
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:25,000
in the DNA sequence since Assassin's

1631
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:27,000
Creed Brotherhood before. Like, that's what

1632
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:29,000
we're doing the next day.

1633
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:31,000
What do you mean? I thought you were just debuting.

1634
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:37,000
So yeah,

1635
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:39,000
that's why

1636
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:41,000
whenever a gen mate

1637
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:43,000
goes live, please, you are more than welcome

1638
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:45,000
to tell me. I will direct

1639
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:47,000
you guys to the gen mate cause I can't

1640
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:49,000
redirect cause my stream, my gate

1641
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:51,000
if my stream isn't over.

1642
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:53,000
So full play through

1643
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:55,000
first day is planned, yes, and then 100%

1644
01:16:55,000 --> 01:16:57,000
the next day, I don't know how long it's

1645
01:16:57,000 --> 01:16:59,000
gonna take, but yeah.

1646
01:16:59,000 --> 01:17:01,000
8 hours isn't

1647
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:03,000
gonna be the norm every single stream

1648
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:05,000
so like, for example,

1649
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:07,000
for example

1650
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:13,000
needy streamer overload

1651
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:15,000
is

1652
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:17,000
2 hours long, I think.

1653
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:19,000
I've never played the game before

1654
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:21,000
I think it's just a click simulator

1655
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:23,000
type thing. I'm not sure.

1656
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:25,000
I've also got

1657
01:17:25,000 --> 01:17:27,000
however, actually

1658
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:29,000
James Cameron's

1659
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:31,000
avatars an 8 hour

1660
01:17:31,000 --> 01:17:33,000
stream, sorry.

1661
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:35,000
Old school

1662
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:37,000
RuneScape is like 12 hours, oh god.

1663
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:41,000
These are all so long.

1664
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:43,000
I need to make up for lost time.

1665
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:45,000
I need to make up for lost time.

1666
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:49,000
Not to mention, once I get

1667
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:51,000
membership, once I get monetized

1668
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:53,000
I'm also doing membership streams

1669
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:55,000
on top of all of this.

1670
01:17:57,000 --> 01:17:59,000
8 hour stream on Saturday

1671
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:01,000
and then

1672
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:03,000
I'm trying foreign sweets.

1673
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:05,000
It is gonna be like a

1674
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:07,000
like a desk

1675
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:09,000
camp. Oh, yeah.

1676
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:11,000
Oh, you get to see my desk, man.

1677
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:13,000
When do you

1678
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:15,000
rest?

1679
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:17,000
I will rest until I'm dead.

1680
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:19,000
I've waited a year to be here.

1681
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:21,000
I have lost time to make up for.

1682
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:23,000
People have waited

1683
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:25,000
in cryo freeze for me for a very long time.

1684
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:27,000
And the way I say

1685
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:29,000
thank you is

1686
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:31,000
rather than saying thank you

1687
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:33,000
is like doing it through content, through ASMR,

1688
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:35,000
through collabs, through everything.

1689
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:37,000
So, yeah.

1690
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:39,000
I'm

1691
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:41,000
making up for it. Oh, no.

1692
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:43,000
Someone says

1693
01:18:43,000 --> 01:18:45,000
don't burn out, please.

1694
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:47,000
I have a secret for you.

1695
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:49,000
I have this thing, your honor.

1696
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:51,000
It's called rautism.

1697
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:53,000
And it means I actually don't

1698
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:55,000
experience burnout.

1699
01:18:55,000 --> 01:18:57,000
I don't experience it.

1700
01:18:57,000 --> 01:18:59,000
I basically

1701
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:01,000
go to sleep and wake up the next day

1702
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:03,000
and I'm ready to take on the world again.

1703
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:05,000
I've never really felt

1704
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:07,000
what burnout is, the way people describe it.

1705
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:11,000
I think

1706
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:13,000
my autism has given me a buff

1707
01:19:13,000 --> 01:19:15,000
and

1708
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:17,000
means I don't get burnout.

1709
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:19,000
And I'm very excited to stream every single day.

1710
01:19:19,000 --> 01:19:21,000
It's a superpower.

1711
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:25,000
Yes, for the foreign sweet stream,

1712
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:27,000
again, that's hand cam.

1713
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:29,000
You'll see my hands. So, if you don't like VTubers

1714
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:31,000
that can show

1715
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:33,000
a wee bit of the flesh. Do apologize.

1716
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:35,000
I might not be for you. However, do have

1717
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:37,000
gen mates that are a little shy

1718
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:39,000
and I don't think they'll show themselves.

1719
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:41,000
So, please be patient.

1720
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:43,000
I'm autistic.

1721
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:45,000
Don't send me a picture of my face

1722
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:47,000
with the hat right now.

1723
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:49,000
So, I can make it my twitter

1724
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:51,000
profile picture right now.

1725
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:55,000
I need to make it my twitter profile picture.

1726
01:19:57,000 --> 01:19:59,000
Strontism.

1727
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:01,000
Strontism is...

1728
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:03,000
Oh, should that be my life tag?

1729
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:05,000
Because I don't get burnout.

1730
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:07,000
Strontism.

1731
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:09,000
Oh, that's really bad though. I feel like

1732
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:11,000
you're making fun of autism. I'm like

1733
01:20:11,000 --> 01:20:13,000
one shut the fuck up. I literally

1734
01:20:13,000 --> 01:20:15,000
have sweaty hands and feet all day long.

1735
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:17,000
Like, fuck you.

1736
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:23,000
You gotta throw a swirl at them.

1737
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:25,000
Swirl at them.

1738
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:27,000
I like that hypnosis swirls. It's like this thing

1739
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:29,000
you swirl on a desk and then you're like

1740
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:31,000
strontism.

1741
01:20:31,000 --> 01:20:33,000
Life tag strontism.

1742
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:35,000
Okay, okay, okay.

1743
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:37,000
I can blame you guys if someone's like

1744
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:39,000
oh my god, you're making fun of autism.

1745
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:41,000
Shut the fuck up.

1746
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:43,000
Anyway, I don't think anyone's

1747
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:45,000
going to watch me that's like that anyway, so.

1748
01:20:47,000 --> 01:20:49,000
Never seen a work horse.

1749
01:20:49,000 --> 01:20:51,000
Ooh.

1750
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:53,000
I guess it's even better than this

1751
01:20:53,000 --> 01:20:55,000
when the memberships come out.

1752
01:20:57,000 --> 01:20:59,000
Strontism is...

1753
01:20:59,000 --> 01:21:01,000
shit in Dutch.

1754
01:21:01,000 --> 01:21:03,000
Ain't no way.

1755
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:05,000
Ain't no way I name

1756
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:07,000
myself Kaka in Netherlands.

1757
01:21:07,000 --> 01:21:09,000
Netherlands.

1758
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:11,000
Netherlands Praten.

1759
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:13,000
Nee jong.

1760
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:15,000
Ik snap het niet.

1761
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:17,000
Ik snap het niet.

1762
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:19,000
Ik heb namen.

1763
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:21,000
Wait, I forgot all the Dutch in the world.

1764
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:23,000
My name

1765
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:25,000
is

1766
01:21:25,000 --> 01:21:27,000
Merda. That's terrible.

1767
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:29,000
I have autism too. Oh my god, autism gang.

1768
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:31,000
Gang gang gang gang.

1769
01:21:31,000 --> 01:21:33,000
Got the Patreon.

1770
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:35,000
Yeah.

1771
01:21:35,000 --> 01:21:37,000
Did you like my Patreon audio? Did you like the demo?

1772
01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:39,000
It was so weird.

1773
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:41,000
Like hearing

1774
01:21:41,000 --> 01:21:43,000
hearing the

1775
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:45,000
the Scots.

1776
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:47,000
You know what I'm saying.

1777
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:49,000
The demo audio was good.

1778
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:51,000
Aw, thank you.

1779
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:55,000
Eh.

1780
01:21:55,000 --> 01:21:57,000
You didn't tell us you could speak Dutch.

1781
01:21:57,000 --> 01:21:59,000
Nee, ik kan niet.

1782
01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:01,000
Was it

1783
01:22:01,000 --> 01:22:03,000

Vrijden. That's German.

1790
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:19,000
I basically used to play Call of Duty with some Dutch folk.

1791
01:22:19,000 --> 01:22:21,000
And then, yeah.

1792
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:23,000
Learn some Dutch.

1793
01:22:23,000 --> 01:22:25,000
Learn some French as well.

1794
01:22:25,000 --> 01:22:27,000
Like if you want to say

1795
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:29,000
justice reigns from above in French.

1796
01:22:29,000 --> 01:22:31,000
Don't worry.

1797
01:22:31,000 --> 01:22:33,000
I've got you, okay?

1798
01:22:33,000 --> 01:22:35,000
Place au deluge de la justice.

1799
01:22:37,000 --> 01:22:39,000
Dutch is so funny.

1800
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:41,000
Azura was like, I'm learning Dutch.

1801
01:22:41,000 --> 01:22:43,000

Azura, I'll teach you.

1803
01:22:45,000 --> 01:22:47,000
I'll teach you how to say turtle, okay?

1804
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:49,000
You say, oh no!

1805
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:51,000
My phone's on 20% battery.

1806
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:53,000
No.

1807
01:22:53,000 --> 01:22:55,000
Sorry, my phone is what I

1808
01:22:55,000 --> 01:22:57,000

01:22:57,000 --> 01:22:59,000
I'm so, ah, my arms are

1810
01:22:59,000 --> 01:23:01,000
shaking.

1811
01:23:01,000 --> 01:23:03,000
Did you hear?

1812
01:23:03,000 --> 01:23:05,000
Hello?

1813
01:23:05,000 --> 01:23:07,000

1814
01:23:07,000 --> 01:23:09,000
Wake up!

1815
01:23:09,000 --> 01:23:11,000
Okay, there we go.

01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:13,000
I just put my charger in.

1817
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:15,000
It's fine, it's fine.

1818
01:23:15,000 --> 01:23:17,000
Everything's fine.

1819
01:23:17,000 --> 01:23:19,000
Stop!

1820
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:21,000
Please, please hold still.

1821
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:23,000
No, I'm sorry.

1822
01:23:23,000 --> 01:23:25,000
Please hold still.

1823
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:27,000
Ah, please!

1824
01:23:27,000 --> 01:23:29,000
Wrong, wrong, wrong!

1825
01:23:29,000 --> 01:23:31,000
Oh my god, my PC's screaming at me right now.

1826
01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:33,000
You guys still see me?

1827
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:35,000

01:23:35,000 --> 01:23:37,000

I'm piloting my neck on.

1834
01:23:47,000 --> 01:23:49,000
I'm doing a terrible job.

1835
01:23:53,000 --> 01:23:55,000
You're literally horizontal

1836
01:23:55,000 --> 01:23:57,000
on my desk right now.

1837
01:23:57,000 --> 01:23:59,000
I'm looking down at you like, hi!

1838
01:24:01,000 --> 01:24:03,000

1839
01:24:05,000 --> 01:24:07,000
Okay, let me have some more.

01:24:13,000 --> 01:24:15,000
Abagando las luces.

01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:17,000
Let's see.

1842
01:24:19,000 --> 01:24:21,000
The ace.

1843
01:24:25,000 --> 01:24:27,000
I mean, it's working, it's working.

1844
01:24:27,000 --> 01:24:29,000
I'm just looking a bit funny.

1845
01:24:29,000 --> 01:24:31,000
Oh my god.

1846
01:24:31,000 --> 01:24:33,000
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

1847
01:24:33,000 --> 01:24:35,000
Alright, let me refocus.

1848
01:24:35,000 --> 01:24:37,000
Let me refocus!

1849
01:24:37,000 --> 01:24:39,000
Get it? Cause you're a refling!

1850
01:24:39,000 --> 01:24:43,000
Six, Griffin, Griffin!

1851

1852
01:24:45,000 --> 01:24:47,000

1853
01:24:47,000 --> 01:24:49,000

1854
01:24:49,000 --> 01:24:51,000
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh my god.

1855
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:53,000

Please phone, just stay still!

1859
01:25:05,000 --> 01:25:07,000
Stop wiggling!

1860

Okay, I'm actually I'm gonna start I'm gonna start turning Scots in a minute. I'm getting raging go and just actual sit still

Okay turns out you can put your iPhone sideways and it still tracks you I didn't know that I've just learned that right now

1866
01:25:42,640 --> 01:25:47,080
That's right ladies and gentlemen, I was the one who

1867
01:25:47,960 --> 01:25:54,000
Judged you if you're a beach over worthy enough to get in the agency, and I've literally streamed for less than two months myself

1868
01:25:54,720 --> 01:25:56,720
I

1869
01:25:57,120 --> 01:26:04,000
Absolutely terrible. I shouldn't talk about that. I'm sure there's some people really really pissed that didn't pick them. Sorry. I was your barrier

1870
01:26:04,800 --> 01:26:07,120
But please understand we also took into

1871
01:26:08,160 --> 01:26:10,160
Someone can have the perfect voice

1872
01:26:11,040 --> 01:26:13,040
Okay, I'm fine. Ah

1873
01:26:14,200 --> 01:26:18,840
Go away. I get scared. I get scared when management show up. I'm like

1874
01:26:19,000 --> 01:26:21,000
Oh

1875
01:26:21,320 --> 01:26:26,680
Leave me alone. Oh, my voice is cracking. Oh crap so much professional

1876
01:26:27,320 --> 01:26:29,800
Big well, right? Let me refresh your questions

1877
01:26:33,000 --> 01:26:36,240
I want you to strong my cuddles until I

1878
01:26:37,360 --> 01:26:40,600
That's such a good sentence. Oh my god

1879
01:26:44,240 --> 01:26:46,240
What do you think of sunken gallery

1880
01:26:48,840 --> 01:26:50,840
Not convinced

1881
01:26:54,120 --> 01:26:56,920
Such operation I know I know I know I know

1882
01:26:57,960 --> 01:27:00,200
Was that the melody of legend of zelda?

1883
01:27:12,520 --> 01:27:14,120
Um

1884
01:27:14,120 --> 01:27:20,040
Will you get multiple endings there's multiple endings I've never played I actually don't know much about the game

1885
01:27:20,280 --> 01:27:22,680
I thought it was like you click buttons. That's all I know

1886
01:27:25,000 --> 01:27:29,720
That you click buttons you'll never get I'm really good at clicking buttons, you know what I'm saying

1887
01:27:31,320 --> 01:27:33,320
They're all bad endings. Oh, no

1888
01:27:34,280 --> 01:27:37,240
They're multiple. There's tons of endings. I thought it was like one of them quick games

1889
01:27:37,400 --> 01:27:39,400
I

1890
01:27:42,200 --> 01:27:47,880
How did you end up getting to pick the talent when you're just new to the agency is there

1891
01:27:49,880 --> 01:27:51,880
Because I'm the creative director

1892
01:27:55,240 --> 01:27:57,240
I'm the creative director

1893
01:28:00,600 --> 01:28:04,600
Good ending is when you get your meds. No, oh, maybe take your meds

1894
01:28:07,480 --> 01:28:11,080
And the voices go away, no

1895
01:28:12,920 --> 01:28:16,440
I don't want to play elton ring and then take my meds because then you guys all disappear

1896
01:28:18,680 --> 01:28:23,000
Oh my god, do you remember that time we played elton ring and we all like

1897
01:28:23,560 --> 01:28:28,200
We're mimicking something and then someone came in and went bang bang and blew us all up

1898
01:28:32,360 --> 01:28:36,600
How big is the vealer team, I mean it depends if you want to count contractors as well

1899
01:28:37,960 --> 01:28:41,080
It gets pretty juicy if you want to count contractors

1900
01:28:41,560 --> 01:28:45,880
Like we've literally got like four more technical clippers coming in. No

1901
01:28:47,400 --> 01:28:56,440
One person's about to be on trial two are like we want them full-time basically. Um, so that adds more people to the website

1902
01:28:58,360 --> 01:29:02,200
Do you count the talents as well? That's another six then technically

1903
01:29:02,920 --> 01:29:09,880
If we disappear who will stream side. Oh, oh, yeah, one of you guys have to come in as the baddie. Wait, what's happening with my arm?

1904
01:29:10,680 --> 01:29:12,680
Oh, what's happening with my arm?

1905
01:29:14,200 --> 01:29:16,040
Oh

1906
01:29:16,040 --> 01:29:19,960
No, I'm gonna have to know you about that a little bit. It's a bit too aggressive

1907
01:29:22,520 --> 01:29:25,240
Are there any big group projects? Yes. Oh my god

1908
01:29:26,760 --> 01:29:29,720
There's such big group projects. I'm so tired

1909
01:29:30,600 --> 01:29:36,360
I planned ahead I planned every month. There's gonna be some sort of event going on at the allure

1910
01:29:37,960 --> 01:29:39,960
Um

1911
01:29:40,280 --> 01:29:42,520
Leave my noodle on. I don't know why my arm breaking

1912
01:29:43,960 --> 01:29:49,080
I'll annoy nari about it. Nari was absolutely fantastic when she came to construct in me. She's fantastic

1913
01:29:49,320 --> 01:29:50,200
Um

1914
01:29:50,200 --> 01:29:51,640
You plan on getting 3d models

1915
01:29:51,640 --> 01:29:54,680
Yes, but you're gonna have to put your money where your mouth is if you want to see the girls 3d

1916
01:29:54,680 --> 01:29:58,520
Put your money where your mouth is give them memberships. Go on the patrons because

1917
01:30:01,080 --> 01:30:04,760
It's expensive because I we would have to buy them the trackers as well

1918
01:30:05,240 --> 01:30:08,600
I actually don't know much about 3d in yet, but I'm pretty sure like you can

1919
01:30:09,320 --> 01:30:13,800
Be our chat model and we can all like touch each other and stuff in there

1920
01:30:14,520 --> 01:30:16,520
And we put you

1921
01:30:19,800 --> 01:30:23,320
Will there be group audios yes, there will be group audios and

1922
01:30:24,280 --> 01:30:27,080
There's already one-on-one audios planned with each other

1923
01:30:27,240 --> 01:30:34,200
But I didn't know the comfortability level of the girls when we were like at that stage of development

1924
01:30:34,520 --> 01:30:37,560
So so far it's azura and sheepsters

1925
01:30:38,680 --> 01:30:40,680
me and mersey and

1926
01:30:41,000 --> 01:30:43,000
emmers and icers

1927
01:30:43,320 --> 01:30:46,280
I've not done anything further. I think donathan rewards

1928
01:30:47,000 --> 01:30:50,680
Will most likely be targeted at that stuff and it'll be access

1929
01:30:51,480 --> 01:30:53,160
free to access

1930
01:30:54,040 --> 01:31:01,240
Because I think public donathan rewards are much more satisfactory. Obviously we will have to do the classic

1931
01:31:02,360 --> 01:31:05,240
like first place second place third place and because

1932
01:31:05,880 --> 01:31:07,880
We do need to incentivize and

1933
01:31:09,000 --> 01:31:11,000
Azura and

1934
01:31:12,440 --> 01:31:16,040
Might be in the position to move out if all goes well and she gets the support

1935
01:31:17,160 --> 01:31:19,560
Like monetary like gets monetized and

1936
01:31:20,200 --> 01:31:24,280
All that jazz and if she can move out she can definitely increase her like stream times for you and

1937
01:31:25,400 --> 01:31:27,400
Just find a easier tang

1938
01:31:27,960 --> 01:31:32,040
That's why I'm kind of like support the others because like they're in positions where like oh if I could move out

1939
01:31:32,040 --> 01:31:35,640
I could definitely meet more content stream for longer do this. Do that be more like, you know

1940
01:31:36,520 --> 01:31:38,520
So definitely support that okay

1941
01:31:39,720 --> 01:31:42,360
Can I drill it in your head anymore to support them or?

1942
01:31:44,200 --> 01:31:46,200
Then you like hypnotize you

1943
01:31:49,880 --> 01:31:53,400
Oh, my picture's on twerp right, okay, I'll get that. I'll update it

1944
01:32:01,240 --> 01:32:03,240
Oh, no the

1945
01:32:04,280 --> 01:32:06,280
A veal or house would be awesome, actually

1946
01:32:06,360 --> 01:32:11,320
And no the girls are like some of them are like still living with family or

1947
01:32:12,200 --> 01:32:17,720
And so they can't really be like oh like, you know all the time so

1948
01:32:18,680 --> 01:32:20,680
Yeah

1949
01:32:21,720 --> 01:32:27,080
We obey we support the girls, but you kindly support the girl. So yeah, um

1950
01:32:30,520 --> 01:32:32,360
That is why

1951
01:32:32,360 --> 01:32:33,880
um, so

1952
01:32:33,880 --> 01:32:37,880
Azura's up first for donathan rewards to kind of give you an idea and

1953
01:32:39,320 --> 01:32:45,480
I'm opening to you know farting about and being open to like kind of the stuff you guys would like to see

1954
01:32:46,360 --> 01:32:48,360
Perfectly fine with me no problem

1955
01:32:51,000 --> 01:32:53,000
Um

1956
01:32:54,040 --> 01:32:58,280
Are the audios on patreon already done do you mean like edit?

1957
01:33:00,120 --> 01:33:01,240
Um

1958
01:33:01,240 --> 01:33:02,840
Only one month

1959
01:33:02,840 --> 01:33:05,000
It's been done. So like june is done

1960
01:33:05,800 --> 01:33:12,120
So the girls responsibilities like contract wise is three streams a week if health permitted. Oh my god

1961
01:33:12,680 --> 01:33:15,240
If health permitted I got asked by one of the girls

1962
01:33:16,120 --> 01:33:21,880
I'll just Azura was like, do I need to give you a doctor's note if I'm sick? I'm like, no

1963
01:33:23,000 --> 01:33:24,200
Go rest

1964
01:33:24,200 --> 01:33:26,440
My goodness, if you're not well, you're not well

1965
01:33:27,240 --> 01:33:28,120
um

1966
01:33:28,120 --> 01:33:34,840
So if they're in good health, they are to stream a minimum of three times a week and monthly four audios

1967
01:33:36,120 --> 01:33:40,200
I definitely do not want to overwork anyone. I do not want them to feel stressed

1968
01:33:40,280 --> 01:33:42,280
I want them to have good times good vibes

1969
01:33:43,160 --> 01:33:45,160
happy ending

1970
01:33:45,800 --> 01:33:47,400
Yeah

1971
01:33:47,400 --> 01:33:49,400
And they've been like super

1972
01:33:49,800 --> 01:33:52,920
Patient and like the behind the scenes stuff going on

1973
01:34:00,440 --> 01:34:04,760
Do you talk often with one each other? Yeah, we're in a we're in a discord. We talk every day

1974
01:34:06,520 --> 01:34:09,080
For two months we've like literally talked every day. Um

1975
01:34:10,200 --> 01:34:11,800
You know some

1976
01:34:11,800 --> 01:34:14,520
Some girls like might feel like awkward around each other

1977
01:34:15,080 --> 01:34:19,080
We had like a couple of gaming sessions leading up to it. We had mock streams together

1978
01:34:19,480 --> 01:34:23,080
I like wholeheartedly feel 100 comfortable around these girls. Um

1979
01:34:23,720 --> 01:34:28,200
Like when it comes to collabing with other vtubers outside the agency, unfortunately

1980
01:34:28,760 --> 01:34:31,320
For me personally, I'm quite inappropriate and

1981
01:34:32,040 --> 01:34:36,360
If I don't know the person and I don't know their comfort level. I'm not really interested in like

1982
01:34:37,000 --> 01:34:40,840
Asking for like, oh, you want to do a vtuber club type thing? Um

1983
01:34:42,600 --> 01:34:48,120
So, uh, I'm probably not going to do too many clubs out with the agency unless like the girls vouch for me

1984
01:34:48,600 --> 01:34:51,880
Or something like I'm I'm happy to make friends with their friends

1985
01:34:52,360 --> 01:34:56,920
But um, it's probably going to be solo content majority on this channel

1986
01:34:57,720 --> 01:35:01,800
And such like content featuring the reeflings when we play our multiplayer games

1987
01:35:02,760 --> 01:35:04,040
um

1988
01:35:04,040 --> 01:35:06,040
Yeah, I

1989
01:35:07,320 --> 01:35:09,320
Um, there is a

1990
01:35:09,720 --> 01:35:16,040
Notification discord if you go on the other's twitter. It's notification only the talents are not inside it

1991
01:35:16,760 --> 01:35:18,760
the talents

1992
01:35:20,920 --> 01:35:23,960
Sorry, my voice is like proper feeling it right now

1993
01:35:24,920 --> 01:35:26,680
um

1994
01:35:26,680 --> 01:35:31,320
Yeah, management don't have access. Sorry contractors don't have access to the talent

1995
01:35:32,280 --> 01:35:38,040
Talents aren't in the notification discord. There's no way you can groom us. We groom you

1996
01:35:40,440 --> 01:35:42,920
Why am I freaking frog blinking?

1997
01:35:46,680 --> 01:35:48,680
It's me has probably not set up my parameters

1998
01:35:53,400 --> 01:35:58,760
One thing get more stable with the group discord for watchers to be joined on the table

1999
01:35:59,480 --> 01:36:02,840
What are you saying? I don't have no idea what you just said to me

2000
01:36:04,840 --> 01:36:09,640
Will you hang out say together outside of the collapse? I don't even know if we're gonna have time

2001
01:36:11,000 --> 01:36:16,040
Like collabs are probably just going to be us meman and like catching up unironically. Um,

2002
01:36:16,680 --> 01:36:18,680
Amy's very pumped for

2003
01:36:19,080 --> 01:36:24,680
Minecraft server in july is when that comes out my uh group minecraft server

2004
01:36:25,480 --> 01:36:27,240
and

2005
01:36:27,240 --> 01:36:31,160
I the last time I really properly prolified minecraft

2006
01:36:31,720 --> 01:36:34,280
And this is going to set a few views back. Um

2007
01:36:35,640 --> 01:36:43,880
The last update was the plant pots were released and I think witches were released and I like never even play that

2008
01:36:44,200 --> 01:36:46,200
properly beyond that

2009
01:36:46,200 --> 01:36:48,200
So that'll be interesting

2010
01:36:49,400 --> 01:36:52,040
Um, I don't really understand anything beyond it

2011
01:36:53,720 --> 01:36:55,720
um

2012
01:36:58,200 --> 01:37:03,640
I think I had to stroke right in that the way I'm stroking right now, baby. Oh stop. Oh my god. Oh

2013
01:37:06,200 --> 01:37:08,200
That's for later, okay

2014
01:37:08,440 --> 01:37:10,840
I'm gonna look in this direction because I think maybe my

2015
01:37:12,280 --> 01:37:14,280
arm doesn't bend that way

2016
01:37:15,240 --> 01:37:17,000
um

2017
01:37:17,000 --> 01:37:21,160
Yeah, Amy's like really excited for me. I don't really know what you're supposed to do in the minecraft game

2018
01:37:22,120 --> 01:37:26,120
Yeah, because according to the cycle video. Oh wait, should I be on?

2019
01:37:26,840 --> 01:37:28,840
Uh chats on the wrong side if I'm looking this way

2020
01:37:30,360 --> 01:37:33,000
Fang on this ring. Maybe a lord friendly

2021
01:37:34,840 --> 01:37:38,280
Oh, sorry, I actually didn't mean that for once. Sorry

2022
01:37:39,640 --> 01:37:44,600
Hold on. I'm looking chat. Excuse me. Oh my hair's in the way. Right. Well, let me put chat

2023
01:37:47,720 --> 01:37:49,720
I'm looking here

2024
01:37:50,440 --> 01:37:52,440
What are you gonna do about it?

2025
01:37:52,760 --> 01:37:54,760
Actually, I'm burping all over you too

2026
01:37:58,040 --> 01:38:00,040
Why are you rating my burps?

2027
01:38:01,800 --> 01:38:03,800
Oh my god, remember tisker

2028
01:38:05,160 --> 01:38:08,360
Remember that time you guys were so nice to me when you could have been so mean to me

2029
01:38:10,360 --> 01:38:15,720
She remember that time. Yeah, I remember that time. Ah, my ears are caught my ears. Those aren't my ears

2030
01:38:16,680 --> 01:38:20,040
I'm a boogies cut off now. There we go. Fix it

2031
01:38:23,000 --> 01:38:30,440
Shebe is having her burps rated too. Yeah, she be burps like me. Oh my god. She's like so oh my god. She's just like me for real for real

2032
01:38:34,920 --> 01:38:38,280
Mom, how am I supposed to support that other girls when you keep filling me in?

2033
01:38:40,440 --> 01:38:44,120
Maybe you're just a reform. I don't know sometimes like

2034
01:38:45,720 --> 01:38:49,320
You don't pick the wait, you don't pick the oh she the oh she picks you

2035
01:38:50,360 --> 01:38:54,120
Because it's like you never you don't know like you you can give so many v-tubers a try

2036
01:38:54,600 --> 01:38:57,720
And then it's just like one you latch on to and you can't get away from them

2037
01:39:00,440 --> 01:39:03,160
Where the things they're not hard for seashells

2038
01:39:03,480 --> 01:39:09,960
Isn't it obvious they're seashells like they're transpiring you can see my little hair through them as well if you like look really hard

2039
01:39:11,880 --> 01:39:15,320
Why am I not feels hold on a minute got talk this girl

2040
01:39:15,720 --> 01:39:23,240
Oh, but I'm still cut off. Stop. I'm not being bullied. I'm being bullied by the youtube studio right now. You know what?

2041
01:39:23,400 --> 01:39:25,160
I'm a victim

2042
01:39:25,160 --> 01:39:30,600
Kind of can you like kind of see the back of my hair through the sea like it's transpired their shells

2043
01:39:31,720 --> 01:39:37,880
They're pearlescent shells in my hair. I still have bunches behind it. Like I have I have hair bubbles

2044
01:39:38,600 --> 01:39:40,600
Oh

2045
01:39:42,920 --> 01:39:44,600
Yeah

2046
01:39:44,600 --> 01:39:46,600
Well, I'll put you behind me

2047
01:39:47,720 --> 01:39:54,280
It's very uncomfortable. I know some people are like, uh, I find it hard looking uh, uh, whammy in the eyes and I was like, don't be fit

2048
01:39:54,280 --> 01:39:56,280
It's fine. It's fine

2049
01:39:58,040 --> 01:39:59,240
Don't mind me

2050
01:39:59,240 --> 01:40:01,880
Don't mind me, baby. Oh my god. I love this model. Look at the

2051
01:40:02,600 --> 01:40:07,000
I love when models do that neck thing where they only like disappears

2052
01:40:07,800 --> 01:40:13,880
It's like the best part like when there is like so much that goes into like picking a model and stuff

2053
01:40:14,360 --> 01:40:20,680
I don't like vtuber models where like the art like the hair and the art like is a billion different splits and stuff

2054
01:40:20,680 --> 01:40:24,440
Like I don't like that. I like that big chunky hair. I think it looks so

2055
01:40:25,960 --> 01:40:27,320
um

2056
01:40:27,320 --> 01:40:29,320
and like

2057
01:40:29,400 --> 01:40:32,600
I like my pupils as well. Yeah, my little squiddles

2058
01:40:33,240 --> 01:40:34,680
any squiddlers

2059
01:40:34,680 --> 01:40:36,680
I'll squiddle you in a minute

2060
01:40:39,480 --> 01:40:41,480
Who's my oh shit at the moment?

2061
01:40:44,840 --> 01:40:46,840
That's actually hard to say

2062
01:40:47,400 --> 01:40:48,680
um

2063
01:40:48,680 --> 01:40:55,240
The thing is I've probably not got one right now. I watched like 300 people during those applications

2064
01:40:55,960 --> 01:40:57,960
There's a lot of people I could oh shit

2065
01:40:59,480 --> 01:41:01,080
Um

2066
01:41:01,080 --> 01:41:02,520
I'm thinking

2067
01:41:02,520 --> 01:41:05,000
You've made me use my brain shame on you. Um

2068
01:41:06,200 --> 01:41:07,800
at the moment

2069
01:41:07,800 --> 01:41:09,800
I'm biased to fen

2070
01:41:09,800 --> 01:41:11,800
um

2071
01:41:11,880 --> 01:41:14,840
I just think she's cute and I really like her minds

2072
01:41:16,040 --> 01:41:19,160
So fen, fen's got my oh she bolt right now

2073
01:41:22,680 --> 01:41:24,920
A scoreboard for the burps honestly, but well

2074
01:41:26,360 --> 01:41:28,600
I won't make you use your brain again down straight you won't

2075
01:41:29,800 --> 01:41:31,800
Bait or not you better not

2076
01:41:36,920 --> 01:41:40,440
Uh, so did you get applications from other vtubers that you were surprised?

2077
01:41:40,520 --> 01:41:43,960
Yeah, there was like pre pre established people and I'm like, what do you want?

2078
01:41:44,120 --> 01:41:47,960
What what why would you want to join you've already got like an entire brand?

2079
01:41:48,920 --> 01:41:53,720
And like thing going on there's literally nothing wrong like they already got their own vtuber models though

2080
01:41:56,120 --> 01:41:58,120
Oh my god, my tongue has physics

2081
01:41:59,400 --> 01:42:01,720
Nari made sure my tongue wiggles are you ready?

2082
01:42:03,960 --> 01:42:05,960
Hey

2083
01:42:08,280 --> 01:42:10,280
Go wiggle physics

2084
01:42:11,160 --> 01:42:13,160
I

2085
01:42:17,480 --> 01:42:21,160
Hey, I'll I'll do a proper hypnosis layer, but my voice is

2086
01:42:26,280 --> 01:42:28,680
Uh, I can only emmy can okay

2087
01:42:28,680 --> 01:42:30,680
So all the models got the same emotions

2088
01:42:31,160 --> 01:42:36,760
But everyone had like a custom toggle or thing going on for them and mine was

2089
01:42:37,480 --> 01:42:40,280
As I move the phone out the way mine was

2090
01:42:41,960 --> 01:42:44,280
I can like layer the eyes together as well

2091
01:42:47,320 --> 01:42:49,320
We'll be playing

2092
01:42:51,640 --> 01:42:53,640
I want to suck your

2093
01:42:56,360 --> 01:42:59,560
Yeah, I mean go hypnosis and I can layer the eyes if I want to

2094
01:42:59,560 --> 01:43:01,560
Do

2095
01:43:08,120 --> 01:43:10,120
Right, let me take that stuff off

2096
01:43:11,000 --> 01:43:17,800
I'll make my sleep bubble my anime sleep bubble. What do you think? Everyone's got a little idle thing like that super idle

2097
01:43:18,920 --> 01:43:23,160
Um, why am I asleep? I'm the phone phone you're

2098
01:43:24,760 --> 01:43:27,160
You're trolling I'm getting trolled oh my god

Right right enough enough. I'm ending stream soon. Is she be still streaming?

2100
01:43:35,800 --> 01:43:37,800
Be honest

2101
01:43:39,320 --> 01:43:45,400
Oh my god, this is a nightmare like absolutely fanny and a boot on this desk right now there we go

2102
01:43:46,840 --> 01:43:48,840
She be still streaming. She's not going offline is she?

2103
01:43:49,000 --> 01:43:51,000
I

2104
01:43:53,880 --> 01:43:55,880
But yeah, I have like one default

2105
01:43:58,440 --> 01:44:01,640

Oh, I should go back to the chatting so you guys can see yourself

2166
01:48:54,200 --> 01:48:57,800
10 minutes fly by what about infinite time? True

2167
01:48:58,760 --> 01:49:06,280
Um, I'm like, um, can I leak my like other stream plans for the rest of the week for the month?

2168
01:49:06,280 --> 01:49:08,520
And I'm like, I'm trying to remember what games I've put down

2169
01:49:09,400 --> 01:49:12,200
And I've already forgotten them all but they're good games

2170
01:49:12,440 --> 01:49:18,760
So we're gonna do old-school runescape consistently for a little bit because I want to get 99 fishing

2171
01:49:20,360 --> 01:49:23,560
Uh, no, not fishing wrong one 99 cooking because I'm a whammin

2172
01:49:27,880 --> 01:49:30,120
Do do do do do do do do do do do do

2173
01:49:31,400 --> 01:49:33,560
And that's actually real

2174
01:49:33,560 --> 01:49:34,360
true

2175
01:49:34,360 --> 01:49:35,160
um

2176
01:49:35,160 --> 01:49:39,240
So I'm gonna try my best horror games. I have a bad heart

2177
01:49:40,040 --> 01:49:43,800
I don't do pause my heart is fine. I got it checked

2178
01:49:44,360 --> 01:49:46,360
I have to go in if there's any issues. Um

2179
01:49:47,640 --> 01:49:53,560
I I can play horror games. It's just ill advised. I would probably do it as like a

2180
01:49:54,120 --> 01:49:56,120
a reward

2181
01:49:56,120 --> 01:50:02,280
without giving the game away oh I know a game I'm playing next week are you guys

2182
01:50:02,280 --> 01:50:10,560
ready I'm playing Skyrim full achievements next week because I know

2183
01:50:10,560 --> 01:50:13,160
how to get full achievements in that game because I've done it a few times

2184
01:50:13,160 --> 01:50:21,400
before and obviously Skyrim belongs to the North thank you very much I'll be

2185
01:50:22,360 --> 01:50:30,080
Stormcloaks yep don't care what they say you know I'm all for Talos

2186
01:50:30,080 --> 01:50:38,520
praise be to Talos so that's my duration game for next week is Skyrim

2187
01:50:38,520 --> 01:50:46,080
first I believe it takes me just over 24 hours to do full achievements and we

2188
01:50:46,080 --> 01:50:49,880
kind of you kind of cheat at the start because you do if you do the

2189
01:50:49,880 --> 01:50:54,200
companion's quest line first and then go back to the save before it so you're

2190
01:50:54,200 --> 01:51:01,520
not a werewolf and then do the vampire quest the problem I don't know if it's

2191
01:51:01,520 --> 01:51:12,880
gonna be a problem if I use an Xbox pass for it because because my Xbox would

2192
01:51:12,880 --> 01:51:23,120
break so many times trying to play Skyrim because the save file issues and I

2193
01:51:23,120 --> 01:51:27,840
if it's gonna be the same way then there's a strategical way to get full

2194
01:51:27,840 --> 01:51:31,600
achievements via the Xbox I already know how to do it I've done it a few times so

2195
01:51:31,600 --> 01:51:34,880
don't worry I'll lay it all out for you baby I'll show you how to get full

2196
01:51:34,880 --> 01:51:38,880
achievements in Skyrim and under 24 hours that'll be my challenge in under 24

2197
01:51:38,880 --> 01:51:44,040
hours I'm sure you can do it under way less but I don't know the strats I'm not

2198
01:51:44,040 --> 01:51:46,360
a speedrunner

2199
01:51:48,360 --> 01:51:54,920
yes I had a girl ghost me because I told her you picked stormcloth what why

2200
01:51:54,920 --> 01:51:58,960
would anyone pick the legion sorry but the elves can perish you're no coming

2201
01:51:58,960 --> 01:52:03,040
into my home country being like no you're not allowed to praise Talos

2202
01:52:03,360 --> 01:52:13,360
excuse me you can get a little bit of casual fantasy or racism don't mind me

2203
01:52:13,360 --> 01:52:19,960
absolutely I'm stormcloth all the way don't care don't care don't care I know

2204
01:52:19,960 --> 01:52:22,400
I'm right

2205
01:52:22,400 --> 01:52:35,600
being team instinct and Pokemon go because if you always follow your

2206
01:52:35,600 --> 01:52:40,640
instincts you'll get there in the end and ironically I'm team instinct oops I

2207
01:52:40,640 --> 01:52:45,240
don't know what you guys are in Pokemon go but I'm team instinct and then the

2208
01:52:45,240 --> 01:52:48,840
mom was like if you always if you follow your instincts you'll always win

2209
01:52:48,840 --> 01:52:53,520
because it doesn't mean you have to win or lose just follow how you feel and

2210
01:52:53,520 --> 01:53:01,400
life is good because team mystic is for like wise people and then team red I

2211
01:53:01,400 --> 01:53:09,240

01:53:09,240 --> 01:53:13,400
I'm just here for the journey I'm just here for the good time thank you

2213
01:53:13,760 --> 01:53:18,120
