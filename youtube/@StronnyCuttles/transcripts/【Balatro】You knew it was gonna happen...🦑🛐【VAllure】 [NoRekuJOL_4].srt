00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:11,440
it gained her one subscriber and i'm like for that price i could have got her five shorts so we're

it that collab stream was so fun looking at everyone else's designs i like at first i actually

27
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:30,640
was like oh maybe i should have added our designs at the end just so we could critique what we like

28
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:34,960
and don't like type thing like we could actually say like oh i don't like this i do like this but

29
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:40,560
then i was like no the stream is about other streamers but please don't be surprised if you see

30
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:47,360
some sort of variation that was so fun and i've seen like thigh rating streams i might do a tearless

31
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:52,320
thigh rating because that was just so fun looking at other people's designs how many slimes were there

58
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:16,480
that's it for today i don't have a collab coming out but i can't record anything oh my god your

that reefling is literally being okay reeflings strung together it's the prego yes unfortunately

61
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:39,840
i can't record any new ASMR because of my dad but he's come down with a cold um he cannot

62
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:46,320
his scottish genes cannot handle the ozzy cold we went i think because we went out to the cafe

63
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:51,920
and he's picked up a cold so i don't know how he's doing um he's like all sniffily he had to

64
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:56,640
get medicine to go to sleep because he was so jet lagged and all that so i'm a bit worried about him

65
00:07:57,760 --> 00:08:04,160
um but next week is like two hour streams and no more like it cut off two hour streams and

66
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:09,600
especially if my dad's not feeling well so yes we are gonna get stuck into it we have a hex

67
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:15,360
add a polychrome to a random joker and destroys all other jokers so we are gonna make sure we

68
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:25,440
remember we have this um um gain 25 bucks is a lot what's this one next is a joker and free

69
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:36,320
i'm all in i'm all in on the the rewards discard two random hearts pair cards pair hand okay so

70
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:42,000
it's been a hot second now we can do it by suit we could get a suit in theory but if it's gonna

71
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:47,120
discard what we play i don't know get rid of the

72
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:55,600
well i don't like this maybe go for a heart no of course because that would be too easy

73
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:58,400
what we got jack 10 98 7

74
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:12,080
I don't know what to go for a flush maybe we need a seven and we could get a flush going here

75
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,760
we've only got two more discards left so i really shouldn't be doing this but

76
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:26,720
oh dear oh dear oh dear i think i've absolutely twatted myself on this run

77
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:30,880
a one pair is all i can get away with right now

78
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:39,040
well we can't do a flush so just go for high cards

79
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:46,640
absolute pitch we can do a pair that's the best we can do we have no more discards i'm sorry

80
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:50,560
i got cocky okay oh wow i've thrown so hard

81
00:09:54,640 --> 00:10:00,400
i'll do another pair shout out to all my pairs yeah i've thrown wow

82
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:05,600

83
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:16,240
yeah drat i've absolutely abysmal this i can only play a high card here one pair

84
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:18,560

88
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:45,360
planes though right we've got the polychrome doubles your money well we can't even do that

89
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:50,000
because we ain't got no money hi glad to see you playing the card game the gamble oh hold on sorry

90

my tracking my iphone is right in the way so i can't actually see what i'm doing hold on i need

91
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:56,080

92
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:06,000
okay recalibrate warm-up game it's real okay the house strong it's gone no we already lost the

93
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:12,640
house right i don't see a flush i see a triple though oh baby a triple okay we've got full house

94
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:19,680
already off the bat very happy with that and this is again just a shorter stream so please do not

95
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:28,080
uh don't get too comfy we can't go that way i really need that skip card again i love that

96
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:34,640
skip card for suits the high table wins again i can't believe it did you guys like that stream

97
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:40,080
where we were reviewing the other uh folks uh designs i thought it was so cute oh we do have a

98
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:47,120
suit sorry i saw a flush sorry a flush but it's all the same color there's no way i can't get

99
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:55,600
comfy here with you he loved it i thought it was a fun idea right add a polychrome joker it destroys

100
00:11:55,600 --> 00:12:02,720
them the first hand of the round only has one card add a permanent copy of it could i just go out on

101
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:14,400
aces uh playing cards can be purchased from the shop what one dna is good super early dna right let's

102
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:20,720
go for it and then we're gonna use him right now okay then what we got a dollar so we can't do nothing

103
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:27,280
with that okay but we've got a multiplier we're gonna go next base edition joker is free and

104
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:32,560
becomes a foil but it's only 50 chips which i'm not that interested in is there an ace

105
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:40,480
well they're just upgrade suits after we've gone through five thousand nine and two just one more

106
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:45,600
round never seen any of the other videos to check them out they're pretty i know it was fun to see

107
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:52,080
other do i hope you get inspired for gentle i do you right i'm gonna sip my tea ah it's already

108
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:59,280
look warm well i do a king well i just do suit cards do king or should i save it for aces only i feel

109
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:04,000
like it was a waste if i don't play it though if i first hand around only has one card add a permanent

110
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:11,200
version of it let's just a kit let's do that here we go okay so king king king uh

111
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:19,440
i can get rid of these please the natural girl dog and the paw patrol we're pretty cute

112
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:24,000
and she's called the say so please which is so adorable absolutely adored it

113
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,760
my god duble v here and we'll just play that don't mind us

114
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:39,680
okay okay it feels good feels good feels good feels good right gains for consecutive hand

115
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:43,840
played without a face so we absolutely do not want that we're going out on faces

116
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:52,240
not interested and we have nothing that's really shaping our deck so i'm gonna hold on for economy

117
00:13:52,240 --> 00:14:02,800
playing cards now where you all space cards are debuff that's fine okay i'm gonna oh am i gonna

118
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:14,640
regret this am i gonna regret doing this i'll duplicate it and save bucket okay we've got a pack

119
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:20,640
i've got a twin and we'll play that because it's debuffed we're going out on high cards we're going

120
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:27,200
all out what we've got queens and aces this is terrible hand let's get rid of all this nonsense

121
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:40,080
we do have a double here and then get rid of the low it's pretty debuffed though oh dear well i've

122
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:46,560
just absolutely ruined that run as well i'm really good at doing that like i'm really really good at

123
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:55,440
ruining runs what am i looking at double what do i need a full house maybe

124
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:02,080
ace king queen jack ten

125
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:07,920
yeah that looks right

126
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:19,600
oh we just made it we just made it we saved it we just made it okay we've got a stick

127
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:22,640
a straight random multiplier

128
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:35,040
do we hold on to economy or do we do misprint the chance of adding a 21 multi can come through though

129
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:43,120
her hat was great detail honestly i love seeing other vtuber designs see what they come up with

130
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:48,640
because obviously agency vtubers are signed whereas indie vtubers came up with a concept

131
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:55,920
theirself which makes such a difference um definitely like right next round we'll we'll stick

132
00:15:55,920 --> 00:16:02,640
to economy we'll stick to economy gives five bucks per skipped blind gives five bucks no what are you

133
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:10,240
initial cards and booster packs are sorry who goes there um identify yourself right king we're

134
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:17,200
gonna activate playhand we're gonna double vr king so we've got more king we've got a full house

135
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:22,880
lovely lovely it was not a very good burp oh my god she be rated my burp so if you didn't know a

136
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:30,160
little behind the scenes for you um when you do a collab you all get in voice chat together one

137
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:34,480
hour before the collab and like i was drinking my team we were just talking away and all that

138
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:40,080
and i burped and she be rated it and i was like oh god i feel so embarrassed of the girls but

139
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:47,840
she burps as well so it's oh no we've only got one hand to play oh i really don't want to end

140
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:55,040
this run already it's such a good one let's see if we can spawn in an ace

141
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:07,520
a full house 40 times four is like what and then plus the tens that's gonna that'll do it that'll

142
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:14,400

00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:21,120
we might we might shape it into a pear run not economy i mean you can sell jolly whenever

157
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:11,360
we have such low economy that might be good

158
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:20,080
because we have low economy it's plus not times i know but if we start shaping it for pears

159

194
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:26,800
so fun i really enjoyed it but i don't know if it was one of those streams where it's like considered

oh thank you i was a bit worried people might find it a bit low but yeah create a tarot card

198
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:52,320
if hand is played with less than four bucks that's so specific earn two dollars per discard if no

199
00:23:52,320 --> 00:24:03,760
discards are used oh that will pave itself back very quickly very quickly choose one of the

200

00:28:54,240 --> 00:29:00,640
sure one plus this card why not it's not the best but now he offers us 1.5

246
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:09,680
it's not the best i know i know it's not the best but i'm making do with what i have okay

my head my head well you know what else i like to shake my willy after a pee because apparently

250
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:32,160
you have to like muck about with your sausage after your pee which is really funny to me

251
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,480
we're just going all out and doubles at this point let's be honest

252
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:42,080
i didn't know do you not have to shake after you do a number one

253
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:50,000

00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:19,200
chalkboard is so good three times multiplier if all cards held in hand are space and clubs

257
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:25,520
the odds of me getting that is rubbish though that's awful that's like so hard to set up

258

00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:10,000
why am i so blank i've literally thrown this one i've thrown so hard bra

289
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:20,160
ah why do i suck so much today i'm so sorry all we're getting is red screen right stop

290
00:34:20,160 --> 00:34:24,000
i didn't lose it there's just a new game i don't know my game glitched out i don't know why it was

291
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:31,520
happening something weird's going on with my screen i don't know what's happening

292
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:39,520
i'm like i don't know okay i don't know there a straight go for it

293
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:45,360
well i mean i've reached i only need 150 now

294
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:52,000
give me something a bit better than that though right sure give me that

295
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:56,560
shimmy oh wait no i should roll for a full house

296
00:34:57,440 --> 00:35:10,160
i absolutely despise when the game i absolutely get i get triggered when the

297
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:14,240
game does that to me honestly right give me this free joker and it better be good

298
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:18,800
each king held gives a multiplier oh that's actually really good

299
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:24,880
adds the sale value of all other jokers owned to a multiplier

300
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:33,920
i mean i guess i kind of need to go all out on jokers like right at the start or else we're

301
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:42,000
not getting anywhere because we only have three hands right think about it logically

302
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:50,240
what should i do if a king is held in the hand i get 1.5

303
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:53,920
so

304
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:07,440
the scar each king so i want more kings in my hand club flush is available

305
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:15,520
fish for kings but don't play them keep clubs and king fish for a flush

306
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:19,200
get rid of them then

307
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:28,320
i hope that's what you're asking me to do refling

308
00:36:31,120 --> 00:36:35,200
okay so we have a flush and we're gonna keep that king in the hand

309
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:48,000
oh okay okay oh yeah okay okay no let me get up gain three value at the end of a round

310
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:57,040
oh is that like a stock market egg that's all he wrote um right we're gonna keep should we buy

311
00:36:57,040 --> 00:37:04,160
that and then just sell it spectral you want the spectral egg is pretty peak okay well we're

312
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:10,480
going to do it invest in our future by buying the stock market egg and then we'll get the spectral

313
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:16,880
pack to see what's inside why not add a blue seal destroy one random card in your hand

314
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:22,960
um add a purple seal to the selected card you creates a turret when discarded

315
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:30,080
create destroy one random right when discarded so put it on a low put medium on a low

316
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:42,000
because it says discarded so surely i discard the lower cards yes is that how it works yes okay

317
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:47,200
thank god i'm really out of it literally you don't you don't play a game for a little bit

318
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:57,440
ooh free joker free joker all diamond cards are debuffed but free joker though

319
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:05,520
yeah the more joker value also that goes up 25 bucks should i do should i do them both

320
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:16,160
no no give me the free joker okay now we'll have a suit unfortunately a king would get consumed in

321
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:20,400
that i'm not sure i want that

322
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:29,600
because that would give times three keep the kings could discard the ace in the three

323
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:33,520
and try and fish for another part

324
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:44,160
when discarded fuck you beach increase the rank of two selected cards

325
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:51,840
can i do what i think i can do and then wait level up the queen

326
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:59,760
strength the queen now that's a blush should i level up the queen in the jack

327
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:06,160
queen and jack increases the rank of up to two selected cards by one

328
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:15,040
yeah okay yeah all right i'm doing it really see what it comes out to if i do this

329
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:18,240
we've got 1.5 for every king held

330
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:26,560
oh we did it we did it we did it and our little egg went up in value

331
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:34,160
okay not bad what are you the first hand of round is a single is a single six destroy it and

332
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:46,480
create a spectrum oh curious curious curious it to double dip it's a multi put it after the pirate

333
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:55,440
yard okay we'll hold on to our economy again unfortunately we don't really have anything

334
00:39:55,440 --> 00:40:01,280
that's actually shaping other than the kings might want to move your first joker to the end

335
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:08,080
to apply all the multis that come in my little egg is now worth five dollar e-dos

336
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:11,680
can use six cents to thin the deck out of that

337
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:16,880
well and get rid of the the weird ones and

338
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:30,400
destroy it and create a spectrum okay we're gonna hold on to our economy king maxing for real

339
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:36,160
yes now baron multiplies the thing yeah right we're king maxing let's see what we've got nope

340
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:44,400
don't do that right we've got two kings off the bat and let's see what we've got we've got a double

341
00:40:45,840 --> 00:40:52,960
eight it's not the best if first hand of is a six well we don't actually have one could fish for a

342
00:40:52,960 --> 00:41:03,520
six all right let's do that let's do that guess i'll go if myself right throw away these

343
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:14,240
uh and we'll get a turret creates a random joker a card must have room sure two chips for each

344
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:22,880
remaining card in the deck sure why not and knock yourself out right i think we're in trouble

345
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:32,000
we have one discard left six gaming wait can i keep doing it if first hand of round is a six no

346
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:37,040
just one six it only works on one six cents oh i just realized the card's called six cents

347
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:41,840
play the six alone wait have i played a hand yet no

348
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:44,560
uh play this one because it's useless

349
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:56,240
wow add a red seal re-trigger this card one time wait if i add a seal to a king is it gonna trigger

350
00:41:57,040 --> 00:41:58,960
baron twice

351
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:14,560
oh my gosh oh my gosh now i am struggling to get anything to play

352
00:42:19,600 --> 00:42:24,160
now we just need a copier card this is gonna be crazy it'll be what's left in the deck

353
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:31,360
hmm we're kind of looking at getting tens or aces to come in

354
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:41,600
spades flush could be an option and kids we only have one more discard left though

355
00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:51,040
on average we wouldn't draw it though i'd be forced to play like an ace or a king or something

356
00:42:52,000 --> 00:43:00,880
um diamond is the most likely suit you're right but diamonds are debuffed completely

357
00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:07,200
through the joker as well i'm not doing anything

358
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:16,560
two plus chips and then egg or beloved egg i will sell egg soon oh he's four he's plus 14

359
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:23,040
the sell value i guess he swashbuckler and egg actually kiss each other very nicely i say we

360
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:31,280
look for tens and nine fuck it fuck it i've got a double here a double there and get rid of the two

361
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:35,680
i know these are debuffed i'm aware but i think we're okay

362
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:43,840
but the kings that are okay yeah we're fine the kings are having fun the kings are having fun don't

363
00:43:43,840 --> 00:43:46,560
worry right whoo what's this

364
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:56,400
hmm that's big one times multiplier for each empty joker hmm we have no for me

365
00:43:58,640 --> 00:44:04,160
the double kings are popping off choose one of three playing cards i mean loyalty cards

366
00:44:05,040 --> 00:44:09,600
we can always sell something later like as i said the egg maybe we can sell later he's worth eight

367
00:44:09,600 --> 00:44:22,640
bucks at the moment um king is carrying oh right hard hard hard okay choose two up to two

368
00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:29,360
four spectral cards we use immediately right i'll do a loyalty card we can always sell it if we're

369
00:44:29,360 --> 00:44:37,840
not feeling it you know it's not a big deal um let's see what we're up against though oh no

370
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:45,520
we're gonna have to get rid of something oh but we can't double skip the shop or else it's not

371
00:44:45,520 --> 00:44:51,600
gonna play next based edition shop joker is free and polychrome it's a times 1.5

372
00:44:57,840 --> 00:45:03,920
should i do it i feel like once we sell the egg it's fine to have low economy because the egg is

373
00:45:03,920 --> 00:45:08,560
currently eight we might sell them next round you might want to look at the hands we can play

374
00:45:13,120 --> 00:45:20,240
well i do spectrum the egg is buffing the pirate it is you're right

375
00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:29,200
ideally we want a few kings our deck is five and we want to get more

376
00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:34,960
hmm i don't know if the standard pack's gonna give me what i want no what's the spectral card do

377
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:40,400
you want spectral yeah sell the egg next round okay i'm gonna do the spectral in exchange of the egg

378
00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:47,520
what are these destroy one random but give two enhanced aces i want king add a gold seal three

379
00:45:47,520 --> 00:45:54,320
bucks earned when this card is played convert all cards into a single random rank one heart

380
00:45:54,400 --> 00:46:05,440
upgrade every poker by one i mean it wouldn't take away or remove a king it would just have an

381
00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:11,360
extra ace all levels is free black hole is always good all right let's pop black hole

382
00:46:13,520 --> 00:46:19,760
what did that do oh we can have a second chance okay well we just do gold seal destroy a random

383
00:46:19,760 --> 00:46:24,640
card in your hand but it gives you two enhanced aces i mean i feel like it's probably gonna attack

384
00:46:24,640 --> 00:46:28,160
something we don't want right if a card is played so we'll shove it on a queen

385
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:34,880
if we make all cards the same rank we could get something nice though but it puts my hand size down

386
00:46:34,880 --> 00:46:45,360
by one which scares me it scares me i'm scared i'll do the gold if i if i lose i right we're

387
00:46:45,360 --> 00:46:51,440
gonna skip to get our times i assume if i skip again it's not gonna show them up is it

388
00:46:53,200 --> 00:46:57,760
because i'm sure i played a game where i skipped and i only got offered one joker card

389
00:47:03,040 --> 00:47:10,640
bad bad bad belt troll player honestly can anyone you'd get both for free i have to like oh i do

390
00:47:10,720 --> 00:47:17,440
right okay fuck it fuck it we're going all out right we've got a king and he re-triggers

391
00:47:17,440 --> 00:47:22,560
but he's debuffed so he's even gonna properly re-trigger all right let's see what we're looking at

392
00:47:23,920 --> 00:47:29,360
let's see what we're looking at we've got a tarot card if we discard what we're looking at suitwise

393
00:47:30,160 --> 00:47:37,200
we actually have a suit unbelievable king of clubs won't proc because he's debuffed unbelievable

394
00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:41,040
i could have put it on any other king and i picked that one right we're gonna throw away

395
00:47:41,040 --> 00:47:46,080
because we can get a tarot if we do this so well we just do a classic discard

396
00:47:48,320 --> 00:47:55,680
and see what we can fish for i think if we fish for more are you ah i was debuffed

397
00:47:58,880 --> 00:48:03,200
oh we're about to get a diamond flush i think we're gonna go for diamond flush

398
00:48:04,160 --> 00:48:11,120
are you fucking serious this is when the game like enrages me give me a diamond

399
00:48:13,200 --> 00:48:14,480
oh and it would be a king

400
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:23,440
this game is such a troll

401
00:48:24,320 --> 00:48:33,680
such a troll oh we got three whoa oh no it's fine oh we're laughing to the bank it is fine

402
00:48:35,680 --> 00:48:39,600
i'll just play that then we literally did it in one whoa

403
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:49,760
what was that worried about oh no see it only gave me one adds one stone card to deck when

404
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:57,040
blind is selected that's shite holy right i'm selling the egg in oh am i selling the egg

405
00:48:59,600 --> 00:49:03,520

00:49:04,160 --> 00:49:08,320
oh no wait it's down here uh you can't see it because i'm in the way but it says there's one

this up it's very likely i am i don't have anything that is complimenting a specific

437
00:52:34,880 --> 00:52:44,720
play style yet yet one times five multiplier if a steel card stays in the hand we will pick that up

438
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:53,280
i might just buy the discard now so we do get a 1.5 in the next shop as well

439

maybe if something is like really not working out uh right what are we looking at we have a

442
00:53:29,360 --> 00:53:36,560
flush for red but i don't really want to utilize it ditch the face or marble oh you want me to do it now

no way

447
00:54:04,720 --> 00:54:08,000
okay so we want to max out on steel capabilities

448
00:54:08,960 --> 00:54:17,840
okay okay okay okay okay okay okay well our king wanted to be a steel streamer luck strikes again

449
00:54:17,840 --> 00:54:26,160
honestly right i'm going for a discard because these are rubbish ooh money if i play it earn

450
00:54:26,160 --> 00:54:32,400
three bucks if this card is played in scores okay let's do that and we'll keep the king and see what

451
00:54:32,400 --> 00:54:43,840
we get we got 3000 for that one hand that's not bad i'm not mad what what didn't we want to steal

452
00:54:43,840 --> 00:54:49,200
our king with the red seal and then start copying it like no tomorrow steel is amazing for large

453
00:54:49,200 --> 00:54:59,520
hand sizes oh you got large hands being teasing right let's try and rule something what are you

there's only one more oh i'm fucking it up sorry i've thrown away

458
00:55:25,680 --> 00:55:33,520
um i think my hands are bigger than your we have the stone or added to our deck every

459
00:55:33,520 --> 00:55:38,880
round with marble joker that's why we i think we can ditch him oh but he gives us 1.5

460
00:55:43,360 --> 00:55:45,440
okay we just need to play any old shite

461
00:55:45,440 --> 00:55:50,000

464
00:56:02,960 --> 00:56:06,720
i don't want to play the kings because they're adding to our multiplier the best i can do is

502
01:01:31,520 --> 01:01:40,080
23 not bad at all okay i think i'm gonna try and hold on to economy

503
01:01:41,360 --> 01:01:47,360
one and four chance for each played eight to create a random tower new up to three i think

504
01:01:47,360 --> 01:01:52,960
i'm gonna try and hold on to economy stop it we need our brains to play no you don't want to

505
01:01:52,960 --> 01:01:59,760
use your other head with me a replay don't be such a stinker the standard pack gives

point to five molly should i get rid of the stone boy he keeps fucking me up i'll replace the

507
01:02:06,400 --> 01:02:18,400
stone boy when we get something good when the when blind is selected stone is buffing holographic

508
01:02:18,400 --> 01:02:24,960
though this is a hard one again we've not really got anything that's shape and anything

509
01:02:27,520 --> 01:02:35,280
i think we just go next right 10k all heart cards are debuffed understood

510
01:02:35,520 --> 01:02:47,120
hmm we've got two kings you love to see it right heart cards are debuffed so get out of here

511
01:02:53,680 --> 01:03:00,800
juicy juicy juicy maybe play a pair and just see i'm gonna play a pair and see what the point five

512
01:03:01,360 --> 01:03:03,120
times on the kings is gonna be okay

513
01:03:05,920 --> 01:03:07,280
other head go

514
01:03:08,160 --> 01:03:12,160

01:03:14,080 --> 01:03:20,320
i was 2000 okay okay let me get up let him get up let them get up right we now have four

516
01:03:20,960 --> 01:03:23,440

517
01:03:23,440 --> 01:03:31,440
oh my clubs are buffed lose the king of hearts yeah he can't do anything at all for us

518
01:03:35,680 --> 01:03:38,800
well i keep the ace have i got another ace i do have another ace

519
01:03:39,920 --> 01:03:44,880
right let's let's see what we've got create up to two random tarot cards that's so specific

520
01:03:45,680 --> 01:03:55,120
sure what's inside speeds are my speeds well who's the speed that's a club

521
01:03:55,120 --> 01:03:59,440
draft destroy two selected cards what like right now

522
01:04:02,240 --> 01:04:03,120
i mean i guess

523
01:04:06,080 --> 01:04:10,080
we can thin the deck out a bit okay i'll what destroy a two and an eight

524
01:04:11,040 --> 01:04:16,640
could make a space flush right now artificially yes i can

525
01:04:18,080 --> 01:04:31,120
so one two and three no three then make them speed prank them john and then one two three four five

526
01:04:31,360 --> 01:04:38,480
sure yeah sure that'll work right

527
01:04:41,200 --> 01:04:46,560
hey we did it we did it we did it do the card thing now no if i destroyed it i wouldn't have

528
01:04:46,560 --> 01:04:55,200
been able to do the flush played cards with speeds wait whoa what's going on with the 1.5

529
01:04:55,280 --> 01:05:02,400
oh wait wait wait re-triggers all played face cut oh no played not sitting in my hand

530
01:05:03,600 --> 01:05:07,440
1.5 who would we give up the stone

531
01:05:09,920 --> 01:05:12,080
give up the stone for the wreath yes

532
01:05:14,880 --> 01:05:22,080
okay yes we're in agreement okay i am so smart uh i'm gonna buy the blank because i i've still

533
01:05:22,080 --> 01:05:26,640
yet to freaking grab the thing i don't know what unlocks when we do the blank we're still not done

534
01:05:26,640 --> 01:05:32,400
it one playing card three i mean i'm like did we just spend our economy at this point

535
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:36,240
i must i must be patient i must behave

536
01:05:39,120 --> 01:05:43,920
but i could add more kings to the deck though did you think about that

537
01:05:44,080 --> 01:05:53,200
hmm take a standard and see i would spend to get the hologram off what hologram steel joker

538
01:05:54,160 --> 01:05:59,680
we want space speed card will she be tempted by greed greed run

539
01:06:02,400 --> 01:06:08,080
we have enough kings okay okay okay okay i will hold on to economy because we're gonna need to start

540
01:06:08,080 --> 01:06:15,120
pumping up them numbers those are ricky numbers okay must play five cards in each hand that is fine

541
01:06:15,120 --> 01:06:21,520
by me we can spade kings or steel we want to have three kings in hand and then play a spade flush

542
01:06:23,040 --> 01:06:25,840
i'm not sure how good i can optimize the run like that

543
01:06:27,760 --> 01:06:35,840
uh it might be worth grabbing this one to make sure we're fine in the psychic

544
01:06:35,840 --> 01:06:43,040
bains the psychic of isaac whoa okay what room three bucks have played retrigger

545
01:06:45,040 --> 01:06:55,760
um okay we have enough we have a double let's see how much we get and if i get a lower card

546
01:06:55,760 --> 01:07:02,960
i'll use the hanged man okay yeah okay right hanged man i'm gonna use on the stone and on the two

547
01:07:03,680 --> 01:07:10,960
surely this is correct we need money for doubling argument yeah do your best mommy i'm trying

548
01:07:10,960 --> 01:07:15,840
i've like forgotten all of my skills right now i'm being so daft

01:10:28,560 --> 01:10:35,280
cards if we can roll the kings into our hand like instantly i think i think we're winning because

581
01:10:35,280 --> 01:10:42,800
22k is a tall order are you guys okay if we skip who goes there i would skip too yeah we have

582
01:10:42,800 --> 01:10:52,640
wrathful joker i'm very small brained i'm sorry oh whoa this is exactly what we were looking for

583
01:10:52,640 --> 01:11:00,880
right hold on let's analyze the situation analyzing me analyzing what we got have we got a suit oh we

584
01:11:00,880 --> 01:11:04,800
do we could do the suit

585
01:11:08,640 --> 01:11:15,840
a spade flush should i play the queen right now for the extra three bucks just in case

586
01:11:17,840 --> 01:11:23,520
a but high card and queen first right okay well so queen and then just take away all of this rubbish

587
01:11:23,520 --> 01:11:28,960
as well so we can get our three bucks and then i'll do the flush deal deal okay we'll do that don't

588
01:11:28,960 --> 01:11:35,840
worry oh no he's twitching oh no it's fine oh thank goodness okay it's okay you're allowed to twitch

589
01:11:35,840 --> 01:11:42,480
it's fine it's fine you're allowed to twitch okay you did the king oh wait did i just throw away a king

590
01:11:45,520 --> 01:11:53,360
oops you don't like it when it twitches oh sorry i don't know what's happened all of a

591
01:11:53,360 --> 01:11:56,800
sudden i don't know how to play battle throw and it's only been like what how much

592
01:11:59,200 --> 01:12:01,600
a loyalty card yeah no

593
01:12:03,520 --> 01:12:06,880
a loyalty card came through earned money at the end of a round

594
01:12:08,480 --> 01:12:12,720
do we want that i mean loyalty card would have to give it up

595
01:12:15,680 --> 01:12:21,360
i'm gonna say something controversial i think get rid of loyalty card and then raise our economy

596
01:12:21,360 --> 01:12:28,480
artificially so we can start really going and hammering into packs because we're needing help

597
01:12:28,480 --> 01:12:34,640
let me just throw in for more content yes lose loyalty yeah i think loyalty is just it's only

598
01:12:34,640 --> 01:12:44,080
coming in so i'm gonna go max out on economy one of four uh one consumable slot one of these up

599
01:12:44,080 --> 01:12:50,080
here i don't really need that it only works one six at a time yeah it's not really coming through

600
01:12:50,080 --> 01:12:56,480
okay destroy a random card creates a random rare joker but it sets your money to zero

601
01:12:58,560 --> 01:13:06,400
i don't even have space for um i wish that was a negative joker but it's not destroy five but gain

602
01:13:06,400 --> 01:13:17,280
money um add a gold seal i think add a gold seal add a gold seal yeah nice and nice and safe gold

603
01:13:17,280 --> 01:13:23,040
seal a bit boring but we're going to try and artificially inflate our economy right we've

604
01:13:23,040 --> 01:13:30,720
got destroy one random card in the hand but add four enchanted just converts all cards in hand

605
01:13:30,720 --> 01:13:41,600
to a single random suit now if that paid off it would be 50 50 if we got clubber speed that is

606
01:13:42,240 --> 01:13:50,640
one to consider destroy one random card no and creates a joker i think we're gonna risk it for

607
01:13:50,640 --> 01:14:01,120
sigil i think we'll risk it for sigil yeah okay 50 50 we want club or spade

608
01:14:03,600 --> 01:14:10,640
okay okay it's not the end of the world it's not the end of the world it's okay it's okay

609
01:14:10,640 --> 01:14:18,240
it is a 50 50 if we got something it's not the end of the world okay it's fine it's fine

610
01:14:19,600 --> 01:14:24,320
all right we're gonna hold on to the the money since we can't really spend anything else

611
01:14:25,680 --> 01:14:30,400
upgrade four of a kind by three levels that's like such a good artificial inflation though

612
01:14:31,200 --> 01:14:41,280
um initial cards are free next shop no i'm gonna try and play i've never we never played

613
01:14:41,280 --> 01:14:50,240
four of a kind you're absolutely right we oh okay okay okay okay let him get up uh

614
01:14:50,640 --> 01:15:02,400
um okay okay okay i definitely want to throw these out oh it has to score it has to score do

615
01:15:02,400 --> 01:15:11,680
not be fooled play the queen of clubs and nothing else just her on her own right so that's an economy

616
01:15:11,680 --> 01:15:22,240
shot and then we'll go for a spade flush okay happy with that and then we'll go for a spade

617
01:15:24,560 --> 01:15:32,320
and then we'll go for a spade thank you we'll definitely play you do and then all of you

618
01:15:32,320 --> 01:15:37,840
together and we get an extra three bucks on top go show me what i want to see

619
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:48,000
oh baby that's exactly what we wanted to see and we got an extra money so we made 10 bucks

620
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:58,160
that round well we made a bit more than 10 if we full house we won so easy great one all good

621
01:15:58,800 --> 01:16:03,520
leave it to me uh right we never economies jumped up

622
01:16:05,040 --> 01:16:12,880
money uh we don't need a consumable slot a tarot if we could transfer something into speeds

623
01:16:17,440 --> 01:16:20,000
select two cards and convert the left into the right

624
01:16:20,800 --> 01:16:21,600
uh

625
01:16:24,400 --> 01:16:27,680
hmm we could maybe get another spade on our side

626
01:16:30,080 --> 01:16:32,400
our emperor just go emperor

627
01:16:35,040 --> 01:16:43,920
fuck it okay doubles money right i'll take it enhances one card into a glass

628
01:16:43,920 --> 01:16:54,640
turn stone into a queen uh probably should all right we're gonna get money will we use a glass

629
01:16:57,200 --> 01:17:02,080
it has a chance to absolutely destroy it though which is pretty high right we'll see if we've got

630
01:17:03,040 --> 01:17:04,080
hmm

631
01:17:11,920 --> 01:17:20,960
last space yeah i'm i'm clean too always do yeah yeah why did you go up this joker gains uh every

632
01:17:20,960 --> 01:17:28,480
time a playing card is added to the deck i am a dumbass i understand okay we don't want these

633
01:17:29,120 --> 01:17:34,560
these aren't good enough these are all given like 1.5s and stuff let's let's stick to the

634
01:17:34,560 --> 01:17:41,600
1.5s hologram we will try and level up hologram now we can't get rid of the golden joker possibly

635
01:17:45,360 --> 01:17:49,120
hmm uh yeah i'm kind of like golden joker

636
01:17:49,520 --> 01:17:58,160
understand's brain has so many wrinkles put the joker on the right to the left

637
01:17:59,600 --> 01:18:04,720
yes no don't get rid of them just yet okay well wait until something better comes up than

638
01:18:04,720 --> 01:18:13,600
abstract joker it's not bad but it's not exactly mind boggling okay we never play four of a kind

639
01:18:13,600 --> 01:18:20,160
so nice try game but we will not be tempted by your demon abilities right what we looking at

640
01:18:21,920 --> 01:18:27,760
we could try and roll for a club's flush and play the queen

641
01:18:30,320 --> 01:18:34,640
we could go for a club's flush what you feeling are you want to queen into inside

642
01:18:36,160 --> 01:18:40,480
i can't even pretend to understand the game honestly i didn't understand it when i first

643
01:18:40,480 --> 01:18:47,840
played but it's just like a chill little thing queen queen five five queen queen five five and then

644
01:18:47,840 --> 01:18:59,200
get rid of the nine and now get rid of the six no get rid of the nine queen queen five five nine

645
01:19:00,640 --> 01:19:08,560
i'm i don't know if i messed up i tried oh i got 10k for that hand okay i i would really love

646
01:19:08,560 --> 01:19:11,280
if we could get the thing that gives us another hand because

647
01:19:13,600 --> 01:19:17,600
it's getting a bit i'm getting shaky okay i'm getting a bit nervous um

648
01:19:23,120 --> 01:19:26,720
now we can do a double get rid of the five

649
01:19:27,360 --> 01:19:39,040
i'd fish for more kings double pair again i mean it has to make

650
01:19:42,320 --> 01:19:48,320
i could just discard these two and see if we can get king from it well close enough

651
01:19:50,080 --> 01:19:53,600
full house right i'll take a full house and we should get a king after this

652
01:19:54,000 --> 01:20:02,720
we should get a few hits as well okay yeah we're fine we're fine smooth sailing smooth sailing

653
01:20:02,720 --> 01:20:09,200
don't worry don't worry don't panic don't panic you're fine we have three more discards but we

654
01:20:09,200 --> 01:20:16,160
need a hand we're not really there's two more jacks in an ace so yeah even if we play like a singular

655
01:20:16,160 --> 01:20:25,840
here discard for more spades really that's enough space oh no we are the likelihood of

656
01:20:25,840 --> 01:20:37,600
rolling a speed is very high okay we would have to get those are you fucking serious

657
01:20:37,600 --> 01:20:42,000
speed

658
01:20:45,200 --> 01:20:49,920
okay that's exactly yeah yeah okay one two three four five nice nice nice nice okay we're done

659
01:20:49,920 --> 01:20:58,000
we're done it's piece of lemon squeezy classic voucher honestly four hundred and one thousand

660
01:20:58,080 --> 01:20:59,520
one hundred and fourteen thousand Jesus

661
01:21:02,160 --> 01:21:15,440
right uh i am needing help very badly we're starting to get very like skin of our teeth

662
01:21:16,800 --> 01:21:20,480
which i don't like gold seal enhances that bonus clubs

663
01:21:21,440 --> 01:21:28,800
clubs and spades i think we're gonna have to change some things into clubs yo the flush joker

664
01:21:30,240 --> 01:21:35,200
your record is still 2.5 million moon or yeah i'm thinking moon honestly

665
01:21:39,360 --> 01:21:41,440
i think it's better to convert

666
01:21:42,400 --> 01:21:51,600
make our spades into bonus i feel like it's because we have an artificial amount of diamonds

667
01:21:51,600 --> 01:22:01,280
at the moment i want to even up the playing field and try and get more spades oh that would give us

668
01:22:01,280 --> 01:22:09,280
clubs moon the hearts four

669
01:22:12,880 --> 01:22:16,480
to get rid of even less chance of a heart yeah

670
01:22:19,040 --> 01:22:24,400
we have more diamond than clubs we're better off just dusting off the clubs not going for balance

671
01:22:24,560 --> 01:22:25,200
um

672
01:22:28,080 --> 01:22:34,960
so then more multi-card select two into a multi-card right we'll do it into clubs

673
01:22:34,960 --> 01:22:42,800
and it spades fuck sorry spades clubs spades do you understand me yes okay

674
01:22:44,480 --> 01:22:50,240
okay we've got multi-cards and we'll do one more i'm really bad at that i'm so sorry right

675
01:22:50,480 --> 01:23:03,520
two tarot cards multi again convert to spades right okay we're happy with spades i'm happy

676
01:23:03,520 --> 01:23:17,280
with spades i think world nine king and and random nine oh wait i want to eliminate

677
01:23:17,520 --> 01:23:24,000
me i want to eliminate hearts don't uh hearts is nine i would take the hearts down to seven

678
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:31,920

679
01:23:31,920 --> 01:23:40,800
okay world world card a wild card okay a consumable saw enhances one selected card

680
01:23:40,800 --> 01:23:46,400

681
01:23:49,920 --> 01:23:52,480
no you're not no i don't accept

682
01:23:55,440 --> 01:23:59,440
i hope we can do this but i'm getting very nervous for a run

683
01:23:59,440 --> 01:24:10,160
we have six we have six hearts and we still pull a heart

684
01:24:12,480 --> 01:24:15,920
fish for kings so what destroy the ten destroy the two

685
01:24:19,120 --> 01:24:22,000
what do you do i get a tarot if you get discarded

686

01:24:38,400 --> 01:24:48,400
um

690
01:24:49,920 --> 01:24:51,200

691
01:24:54,880 --> 01:25:01,520
i try and get a king on board though right we want suits not kings right well just sell these

692
01:25:02,480 --> 01:25:04,080
turn the heart into a glass

693
01:25:07,040 --> 01:25:13,360
i don't want to play hearts though i don't like i don't like the concept of glass cards

694
01:25:13,360 --> 01:25:16,800
because i don't want to destroy anything right i'm sorry and this is going to frustrate you

695
01:25:16,800 --> 01:25:21,680
but i don't like those cards so they're not getting played we're going to do for flush

696
01:25:21,680 --> 01:25:24,880
and then we're going to hopefully get some kings as a result of this flush

697
01:25:25,680 --> 01:25:32,240
what are we getting okay 20 cube

698
01:25:34,240 --> 01:25:36,160

free jokers if we lose it doesn't matter because we've only just gotten started honestly it's not a

717
01:28:07,280 --> 01:28:16,880
big deal so let's get rid of these let's get rid of these there we go it doesn't matter if we lose

719
01:28:22,320 --> 01:28:31,280
difficult run i've never kind of done anything of that nature i mean let's go full house and just

720
01:28:31,280 --> 01:28:37,200
i know it's not going to count on some of the cards but bro i just need one more hand we're just

fine we do have one more hand one more hand do we i have only one more discard uh i actually

722
01:28:47,840 --> 01:28:53,040
don't like the look of this i want to get rid of the diamonds the odds of them showing up are really

723
01:28:53,040 --> 01:29:04,480
low play a pair we need 12 cheats throw the diamonds based cheats on pair of men oh the

724

726
01:29:25,120 --> 01:29:31,200

802
01:39:10,320 --> 01:39:17,920
i have to go back so this is a bit of insider knowledge um i reviewed what the script master

803
01:39:17,920 --> 01:39:24,560
made for ac and i specifically said take out all of this meme language because i was like ac's first

804
01:39:24,560 --> 01:39:30,320
language is in english as well as this gets very convoluted and confused in the girls like we

805
01:39:30,320 --> 01:39:34,480
specifically make the recording times really easy on them because i don't want them to be worried

806
01:39:34,480 --> 01:39:39,520
about like this big massive essay of the script and then she be has just shown me what's already

807
01:39:39,520 --> 01:39:44,880
been submitted for her and we're glorping glizzle sticks or wherever the frick the sayings are and

808
01:39:44,880 --> 01:39:50,080
i was like aw i thought i dealt with that but i'm gonna have to ask script master to now go back

809
01:39:50,080 --> 01:39:55,520
and take out all the memes because yeah uh i'm gonna have to ask them to take it a bit more

810
01:39:55,520 --> 01:40:01,360
serious because yeah i'm not sending glorp your glizzle sticks to the girls to freaking perform

903
01:51:20,320 --> 01:51:28,000
what the options are egg has a multiplier the egg is throwing our early power though you can

904
01:51:28,000 --> 01:51:32,880
death when next round with this joker alone just go next strongy when you're raging like that can

905

913
01:52:30,560 --> 01:52:36,080
we have a king queen 10 and 9

914
01:52:37,440 --> 01:52:44,240
i agree i agree we have to throw for her now you're not throwing don't be so stinky

915
01:52:46,640 --> 01:52:49,520
we need a jack and we have a straight for high multi

916
01:52:50,080 --> 01:52:50,640
hmm

917
01:52:53,680 --> 01:52:58,560
well get rid of the name if we get a jack it's two dollars extra how

918
01:53:01,680 --> 01:53:07,600
really there there are only four jacks but 11 more hearts what's wrong with hearts

919
01:53:08,320 --> 01:53:20,080
two four strips each hand is a dollar oh okay queen queen nine nine and a three

920
01:53:23,600 --> 01:53:29,520
oh i see she became by and said hi yes they did the adorable darlings emmy and sheepsters came in

921
01:53:30,800 --> 01:53:35,600
so we want to win on the for endurance and only ink when she wins around i'd be so down to that

922
01:53:35,680 --> 01:53:44,000
i'd be so down for it right everyone group time i'm getting fucking rolled

923
01:53:46,080 --> 01:53:52,960
okay i'll play this hand see what happens it's okay okay we got that we got this we got we got

924
01:53:52,960 --> 01:53:59,280
money we got money money we got 300 for that that's 100 tips plus 20 from the queens and the nine

925
01:53:59,600 --> 01:54:07,280
there's no way you can do maths that good to know that's insane

926
01:54:13,040 --> 01:54:19,600
quick king king 10 10 3 is this enough there's no way you can do the math that quickly that's

927
01:54:19,600 --> 01:54:25,520
insane do you have autism how can you do the math that quick

928
01:54:27,920 --> 01:54:35,280
all cards and packs in the shop are cheaper 100 chips this joker gains for each thingy

929
01:54:39,520 --> 01:54:45,040
yes i have no diagnosis but i just like math and poker maybe it's maybe it's your special interest

930
01:54:45,120 --> 01:54:51,040
what a question i just have this stuff i i cannot do the math like that okay i cannot add

931
01:54:52,400 --> 01:54:56,480
don't know how you're doing it you underestimate autism all your tisms are belong to us

932
01:54:57,040 --> 01:55:02,240
nearly 10k and it's not enough for her nearly 10k tentacles and none of what do the reeflings get

933
01:55:02,240 --> 01:55:08,800
if we make you win i already owe you like two audios and then i owe even more audios on top

934
01:55:09,520 --> 01:55:18,640
skip not even the clearance sale money for range balotro audio and i bag second in line are you

935
01:55:18,640 --> 01:55:23,520
second in line okay thank you reluctantly saying thanks for the tip i'm so sorry if i scared anyone

936
01:55:23,520 --> 01:55:29,040
with my rage but oh my god i start throwing things at the wall when i get ready to throw

937
01:55:29,040 --> 01:55:38,640
all my cards get the hollow get the hollow clearance is good right wait do i have another round

938
01:55:39,360 --> 01:55:46,320
up coming up coming what have i got i can skip for a rare joker for next i don't know if we should

939
01:55:46,320 --> 01:55:58,160
do that wait early hologram is great if i buy clearance sale will it be cheap enough to get

940
01:56:01,520 --> 01:56:05,360
strongly the rage draws more people in are you people actually enjoy rage streams

941
01:56:06,080 --> 01:56:13,760
no it won't multi everything else clearance will be their next shop okay we will get the multi

942
01:56:15,200 --> 01:56:22,160
and we have six bucks so we don't we'll just go next i love your range buying clearance would

943
01:56:22,160 --> 01:56:26,640
take two dollars off okay we'll buy clearance next time because i think it does help overall with

944
01:56:26,640 --> 01:56:33,360
economy that is kind of shy sense of bonus did we skip for the free joker is the question

945
01:56:33,360 --> 01:56:37,120
we have six joker slots and we could get something that might shape a deck

946
01:56:38,960 --> 01:56:44,080
we'll skip i think skip skip okay let's get our free joker we can maybe sell it for money for

947
01:56:44,080 --> 01:56:52,720
really want okay okay let me analyze i'm analyzing i see jack jack three three and throw the two

948
01:56:54,720 --> 01:57:00,240
and jack jack three three oh wait ignore that no don't skip if you want to buy clearance

949
01:57:00,240 --> 01:57:09,280
okay jack jack three three and two so we have queen jack ten we need two cards for a straight

950
01:57:09,280 --> 01:57:13,200
i mean we have the guaranteed two pair right now i don't know how much it's gonna give though

951
01:57:14,640 --> 01:57:23,040
how much is the street in terms of a multiplier straight is a hundred times eight double is

952
01:57:23,040 --> 01:57:32,480
20 times two i hate to say it we might be better off going for a place oh wait did i look at the

953
01:57:32,480 --> 01:57:35,920
wrong one sorry i looked at the wrong one i said i looked at straight flush sorry sorry sorry sorry

954
01:57:35,920 --> 01:57:44,240
sorry all right um it's really not straight is four i love when you read just not hot

955
01:57:45,520 --> 01:57:49,440
don't aim for the low that's how you lose all the previous runs so looking for a club flush would

956
01:57:49,440 --> 01:57:54,320
be the best but right now holographic joker gives you nothing because i've yet to add a card to the

957
01:57:54,320 --> 01:58:00,720
dirt but he is lurking look at him lurking in the shadows getting ready flush is honestly the most

958
01:58:00,720 --> 01:58:07,920
generally powerful hand in the game unless you get op builds yeah i'm i've won consecutively

959
01:58:07,920 --> 01:58:15,680
jude so what throw away these four and throw away a jack and then get a king and a nine in

960
01:58:15,680 --> 01:58:26,240
and go for like a king a nine an ace here jack jack three three two should score four hundred

961
01:58:27,200 --> 01:58:33,920
it's a bit on the lower side keep the jack and throw away the wee ones

962
01:58:36,240 --> 01:58:42,720
one forget backseat streaming you guys are the stream we want a flush look for clubs

963
01:58:42,720 --> 01:58:49,920
look for clubs that makes my hand even smaller oh well we actually might get clubs

964
01:58:52,000 --> 01:59:00,880
what am i looking at here that's kind of we're one off of a club but we've got such a strong hand

965
01:59:02,080 --> 01:59:08,240
or layer for pin pals and harem shebe is live yes don't be afraid we'll probably redirect into

966
01:59:08,240 --> 01:59:14,400
sheepsters if she's up you know you know who else is up my penis oh emi's in the stream too oh they

967
01:59:14,400 --> 01:59:20,480
didn't impromptu stream together okay i'll redirect into them if we lose her when doesn't matter

968
01:59:20,480 --> 01:59:25,600
i'll just put a big warning in the title and be like i failed shebe is collabing with emi oh what

969
01:59:25,600 --> 01:59:32,880
are they doing i'm allowed to stalk them hold on i'm just gonna make sure i'm redirecting into them

970
01:59:32,880 --> 01:59:38,320
because i don't want to i don't want to waste it okay i don't want to waste it redirect

971
01:59:40,880 --> 01:59:47,280
shebe gorilla oh my god something something giggles stick with emi what are they doing are

972
01:59:47,280 --> 01:59:53,200
they reading the scripts live i swear if they're reading the scripts live they're playing with

973
01:59:53,200 --> 02:00:00,720
their giggles to stop we only have ace ace jack jack six should i do it ace ace jack jack six

974
02:00:03,600 --> 02:00:06,400
i think we should i think we need to start getting points down

975
02:00:08,320 --> 02:00:10,080
no wait

976
02:00:12,720 --> 02:00:15,440
what is in our deck this is in our deck

977
02:00:18,800 --> 02:00:22,240
that is exactly what they're doing okay well as long as they're having fun

978
02:00:23,840 --> 02:00:26,320
as long as they're having fun that's the main thing

979
02:00:28,000 --> 02:00:32,720
you want to aim for high multi you have to choose to either dig or play hands we can't do both

980
02:00:33,280 --> 02:00:39,520
well you guys better start using your one brain cell that you share if i discard for non clubs nice

981
02:00:39,520 --> 02:00:47,040
dick bro yeah yeah you like that i've got a big dick yeah it's a script that was red is real i'm

982
02:00:47,040 --> 02:00:52,240
pretty sure it's the least costly i have no idea if they've gone and edited it to make it a bit more

983
02:00:54,160 --> 02:00:56,400
if we go for club suit

984
02:00:58,960 --> 02:01:02,480
if we want to win hard we need to get a straight or a flush

985
02:01:04,320 --> 02:01:06,480
i would have to get rid of the ten the queen

986
02:01:09,200 --> 02:01:13,520
and the jack and the ace and just go all out for a speed but that's terrible

987
02:01:13,600 --> 02:01:22,880
a royal flush of clubs so is how you use that big thick what's left in our deck

988
02:01:24,240 --> 02:01:26,560
it's not looking good that's all i'm gonna say

989
02:01:31,680 --> 02:01:34,960
i would discard just the diamonds and leave these guys in

990
02:01:43,760 --> 02:01:46,960
hmm

991
02:01:57,920 --> 02:02:05,120
that was not supposed to work out but it did that was not supposed to work out by most certainly good

992
02:02:05,680 --> 02:02:15,120
woo right okay unfortunately we've got rid of our tens really um right so if i do a jack is that

993
02:02:15,120 --> 02:02:29,520
enough no it's not no no any hand wins that's it i don't think so wait blue joker blue joker

994
02:02:29,920 --> 02:02:38,320
it will be with the plus chips take a look i will math i don't know how any of this right

995
02:02:38,320 --> 02:02:41,680
i mean we've got another two hands so it's fine all you do win

996
02:02:43,680 --> 02:02:49,040
i do okay okay okay right not as a free joker let me see

997
02:02:50,720 --> 02:02:58,640
each played card with diamond suit gives 1.5 win scored suit will change at the end of each round

998
02:02:58,640 --> 02:03:02,880
sure and you come knock yourself out right

999
02:03:08,240 --> 02:03:14,480
do we want to buy i think we want to buy voucher now or we're gonna lose it yeah we're gonna lose

1000
02:03:14,480 --> 02:03:21,040
voucher now i know i know but everything's a bit cheaper i know our economy's low i know i know i

1001
02:03:21,040 --> 02:03:28,560
know right base chips and mullies have had we're not winning this bro we are not winning this

1002
02:03:28,560 --> 02:03:36,480
i'm so tired eight seven six five four which we don't have we have a double we're very close to a

1003
02:03:36,480 --> 02:03:44,560
suit as well go super hard for diamonds is that what it is it's diamonds right now

1004
02:03:47,680 --> 02:03:52,320
we have it what's our new joker ancient it wants diamonds

1005
02:03:52,720 --> 02:04:02,400
uh should i just throw for diamonds yeah diamond what take out the lower cards

1006
02:04:05,200 --> 02:04:09,200
new fish for diamond mommy about to lose and be really angry and the script master's gonna get

1007
02:04:09,200 --> 02:04:10,560
triggered and and he's

1008
02:04:15,520 --> 02:04:20,720
the queen too okay diamonds out all out on diamonds okay okay

1009
02:04:23,200 --> 02:04:32,080
what i'm worried about is if i don't discard this damn king we're gonna get rolled the king too

1010
02:04:34,720 --> 02:04:40,240
discard all non diamonds okay ying wait should i just go for i can't go for a flush

1011
02:04:41,680 --> 02:04:47,520
uh right level one flush surely this is gonna work surely

1012
02:04:48,400 --> 02:04:57,120
okay okay okay okay so he's now spades

1013
02:04:59,200 --> 02:05:03,120
okay okay we've got nine bucks do we want to do anything

1014
02:05:06,400 --> 02:05:17,360
i really think so i'd buy the standard pack since hologram standard pack okay that's two

1015
02:05:17,360 --> 02:05:20,480
if two of you say the same thing i'm just like yes yes

1016
02:05:21,360 --> 02:05:26,240
uh we could do money we could do money or we could do 10

1017
02:05:28,640 --> 02:05:38,000
up to you you want the queen yeah queen money okay darling right so that did upgrade our hologram

1018
02:05:38,960 --> 02:05:42,640
and then we go next next

1019
02:05:42,640 --> 02:05:50,000
stones are shite unless you've got a deck around them i think that'd be very specific okay next

1020
02:05:50,000 --> 02:05:56,800
it is re-rolls the next shop nope ooh we've got a 1.5 joker coming up though

1021
02:06:00,960 --> 02:06:07,760
uh right off the bat uh close to one wait what are you spades just throw for spades

1022
02:06:07,760 --> 02:06:14,160
spades you are my queen stony stop it refling what you want me you'll make kiss you take that

1023
02:06:14,160 --> 02:06:19,520
refling what you're gonna do about it well we throw for spades okay we throw for spades

1024
02:06:20,560 --> 02:06:25,840
in the name of the spades we throw i'm gonna that's spades

1025
02:06:28,320 --> 02:06:30,240
in the name of the spades we throw

1026
02:06:38,640 --> 02:06:40,640
uh huh

1027
02:06:47,440 --> 02:06:52,160
play the trash okay i'll play the trash i read play the trash i'm playing

1028
02:06:54,080 --> 02:07:02,080
yeah yeah oh wait okay i know this looks crazy but let me just play it for the money and then

1029
02:07:02,080 --> 02:07:10,400
we'll do a thingy we need that money don't worry we've got it we've got it go

1030
02:07:14,640 --> 02:07:21,680
ta-da see we got it see you are worried about nothing okay we definitely if we could get a card

1031
02:07:21,680 --> 02:07:28,960
that goes for like a flushes three of a canes no straight no we want flushes

1032
02:07:29,280 --> 02:07:38,960
what am i doing okay i think we just need a you want a standard pack okay

1033
02:07:41,200 --> 02:07:50,800
ooh fancy cards we've got a foil stone a planet if it's held money if the card is held

1034
02:07:51,760 --> 02:07:54,400
creates a turret when discarded

1035
02:07:56,320 --> 02:08:00,480
or we can use it as a multiplier in a scary situation

1036
02:08:02,400 --> 02:08:05,520
because three fours at the time won't discard any given card okay

1037
02:08:06,240 --> 02:08:14,240
so clubs ace of clubs may come in clutch for safety so he's now at 1.5 uh what's arena do

1038
02:08:14,240 --> 02:08:16,160
oh it's a turret anything else

1039
02:08:19,600 --> 02:08:25,840
kiki or dago next we can take the arcana you want it

1040
02:08:28,880 --> 02:08:33,280
what's our we've got hearts this round it won't cost us an interest this is true

1041
02:08:35,600 --> 02:08:40,720
uh could make our deck better let's see what we're looking at strength increase a rank

1042
02:08:41,680 --> 02:08:49,920
a wild card a two planet cards maybe we maybe doubles money which is not good enough at the

1043
02:08:49,920 --> 02:08:56,240
moment or a glass honestly i'm kind of like planet wild card wild card oh you want wild

1044
02:08:56,240 --> 02:09:03,760
cards sorry okay wild card on queen plant or wild card wild card is consistency

1045
02:09:04,240 --> 02:09:08,400
guaranteed joker proc wild or hermit i am all

1046
02:09:09,840 --> 02:09:12,880
i'd say ace but it doesn't matter that much at the end of the day okay

1047
02:09:14,480 --> 02:09:20,960
ace into a wild card okay and then we go next we're not doing that

1048
02:09:21,600 --> 02:09:28,960
uh i'm definitely gonna invest in any planet cards that are for flushes because this is

1049
02:09:28,960 --> 02:09:37,360
literally the only thing keeping us going right now we can skip for a 1.5 joker

1050
02:09:39,440 --> 02:09:44,640
yeah i agree okay let's see what we're up against discard two random cards per hand

1051
02:09:45,440 --> 02:09:48,000
ooh we can get a turret if we want right now

1052
02:09:50,320 --> 02:09:57,520
we don't have a suit so not oh wow we have a four of a cane that's rare

1053
02:09:59,200 --> 02:10:03,440
i don't like ever get that and then we'll just throw the the the six away

1054
02:10:05,040 --> 02:10:11,120
what is your joker asking for hearts and that's only playing one heart so we can roll for more hearts

1055
02:10:13,440 --> 02:10:16,960
i believe through you want me to play the ace leave the six

1056
02:10:21,360 --> 02:10:27,680
we want to hunt a heart flush i mean that's only removing one heart if we do four of a kind

1057
02:10:27,680 --> 02:10:36,240
60 times 7 times 1.5 times a little 1.5 here and it's 9k oh we're gonna make it

1058
02:10:38,160 --> 02:10:45,120
wait if it's 9k can i destroy it i want to discard it like right now what did i get increase the

1059
02:10:45,120 --> 02:10:54,080
rank curious 9k is a heart flush discard the ace yeah i've got increased the rank of cards i don't

1060
02:10:54,080 --> 02:11:01,760
really know what to do with them hunt for hearts okay we will hunt for hearts bye bye bye bye bye bye

1061
02:11:01,760 --> 02:11:12,160
bye bye bye i'd save strength for now save it get rid of you you and you even though the wild

1062
02:11:12,160 --> 02:11:21,600
card can be used as any suit wait a minute is that a heart keep the ace oh he counts as a heart

1063
02:11:21,600 --> 02:11:29,440
that's so cool i didn't realize that okay discard the rest one two three four five yeah he does

1064
02:11:29,440 --> 02:11:35,920
register as a flush that's so cool okay off you pop

1065
02:11:41,920 --> 02:11:48,960
11k for that that's so cool i hate to mean that bye bye bye right what did we get

1066
02:11:49,920 --> 02:11:54,720
played face cards give multiplier wins scored okay we've got a little cute a bit too easy there

1067
02:11:54,720 --> 02:12:04,000
okay we're diamonds a gold card a spectral pack smiley's pretty neat okay i'm gonna stick it what

1068
02:12:04,000 --> 02:12:12,320
we got what are we looking up next base edition has a free negative and a 1.5 oh i think we're

1069
02:12:12,320 --> 02:12:19,600
skipping i kind of want to skip because that's 10 000 start with zero discord oh that completely

1070
02:12:19,600 --> 02:12:29,600
destroys what we want to do don't double skip i don't think we can we don't even have we don't

1071
02:12:29,600 --> 02:12:39,760
have consistency no what do you do you increase rank then we want to buy a spectral grab the

1072
02:12:39,760 --> 02:12:47,280
spectral it might help out in our time of need what's this destroy one random card in your hand

1073
02:12:47,280 --> 02:12:54,000
and get two enhanced aces create two copies of one selected card in your hand

1074
02:12:58,640 --> 02:13:08,240
ace two copies two copies of a face card do the a cryptic ace so call in the queen or the ace

1075
02:13:08,240 --> 02:13:16,240
yeah ace okay okay oh and he went up to two because of that okay okay he's now times two we're

1076
02:13:16,240 --> 02:13:23,200
getting there now are we better spending to try and protect ourselves from what's coming up we

1077
02:13:23,200 --> 02:13:29,120
have the water start with zero discards that is rough now i do want to skip for this negative

1078
02:13:29,120 --> 02:13:34,720
joker it allows us an extra slot however i do want to play this one and go to the shop and

1079
02:13:34,720 --> 02:13:41,360
see what we can buy to help us skip the first buy devil to be honest i'd say for the shop after

1080
02:13:41,360 --> 02:13:53,360
the big plane devil is minus two minus one but three bucks says if a hand is held and i'm not

1081
02:13:53,360 --> 02:14:01,920
really fussed for that do we want to do the arena is the question devil is neutral

1082
02:14:04,800 --> 02:14:07,440
do we want a specific hidden turret

1083
02:14:10,000 --> 02:14:16,240
now you see skip right next round right next round next round next round i'll hold on to my two

1084
02:14:16,240 --> 02:14:22,160
dollars interest for this play right we're gonna skip for the negative joker but we are gonna play

1085
02:14:23,360 --> 02:14:31,840
why are you constantly prompting me just oh well i ain't gonna complain did we want to increase the

1086
02:14:31,840 --> 02:14:38,400
rank of two selected cards by one are we wanting to use that what suit does the joker want oh he

1087
02:14:38,400 --> 02:14:44,000
wants diamonds whoops he wants diamonds okay i'll throw for diamonds well we don't need to draw it

1088
02:14:44,000 --> 02:14:50,640
to be money neutral joker wants diamonds yes okay so we are gonna throw unfortunately it was nice

1089
02:14:50,640 --> 02:14:58,000
having you while you were here but goodbye we want diamonds oh come on give us diamonds bro

1090
02:15:01,040 --> 02:15:05,200
the second joker to the right the second joker to the right

1091
02:15:08,080 --> 02:15:09,520
move smiley to the left

1092
02:15:13,840 --> 02:15:16,960
if you're going to discard five you might as well play the hand oh

1093
02:15:17,920 --> 02:15:27,920
oh sorry what did i get for a neutral oh that's 6k for that that was me bad oh what's going on

1094
02:15:30,800 --> 02:15:32,240
the game's actually trolling

1095
02:15:34,960 --> 02:15:41,440
oh come on as if we're not gonna pull a heart now we have one more discard

1096
02:15:42,240 --> 02:15:45,760
this is rubbish

1097
02:15:50,240 --> 02:15:53,600
i could upgrade what i don't know

1098
02:16:02,000 --> 02:16:08,800
wait wait wait what can i do i could make these are nine to give us a what queen

1099
02:16:09,200 --> 02:16:20,800
jack ten nine i need a seven though no no just do it on one card i can artificially create a

1100
02:16:20,800 --> 02:16:28,960
strength queen jack ten nine eight surely this is how the good lord intended it

1101
02:16:31,120 --> 02:16:36,480
is this what is this am i throwing no i'm not because we only need one round

1102
02:16:36,480 --> 02:16:41,920
okay okay sorry we only needed one i overthought that a little bit my apologies but we did what we

1103
02:16:41,920 --> 02:16:54,400
did cash out okay negative jokers and 80 chips if it's got a pair okay consumable slot i'm not

1104
02:16:54,400 --> 02:17:01,760
really bothered about choose one of up to four joker cards and choose one of up to three playing

1105
02:17:01,760 --> 02:17:09,840
cards maybe the playing cards one um i mean we definitely could have had a better joker to hit

1106
02:17:09,840 --> 02:17:14,560
yeah but i mean we got an extra joker slot and we get a lot of bonus for pairs if we want

1107
02:17:15,520 --> 02:17:25,360
standard pack because it will upgrade hologram okay oh what are you you're so shiny hold on i'm

1108
02:17:25,360 --> 02:17:31,920
taking a little hydration please hydrate a little briefly splurge a little because you get no discounts

1109
02:17:31,920 --> 02:17:39,600
next round isn't the thing a permanent discount take the holographic four is good okay nice and

1110
02:17:39,600 --> 02:17:45,680
simple we'll take four yeah and now he's 2.25 okay okay we'll we'll need to keep an eye on

1111
02:17:45,680 --> 02:17:53,520
hologram he might be coming in clutch uh right we are now clubs ahoy i repeat we are now we could

1112
02:17:53,520 --> 02:18:04,560
get a joker but we take as below the uh interest take the buffoon okay okay let's see what jokers

1113
02:18:04,560 --> 02:18:12,640
in stock come on oh right create a turret if you're poor earn two bucks if you don't use this card so

1114
02:18:12,640 --> 02:18:20,960
that's no good 100 chips if you play three of a kind and uh flush we're playing flushes

1115
02:18:21,200 --> 02:18:29,200
yeah we're playing flushes aren't we yeah yeah okay let's put you somewhere over here

1116
02:18:29,760 --> 02:18:37,440
put you there put you somewhere over here and we still have room at the end for a cheeky

1117
02:18:38,160 --> 02:18:45,840
what are we looking at feed it upcoming okay start with zero discards this is going to be curious

1118
02:18:45,920 --> 02:18:54,240
but you never know i'm sure this will go fine we have to win three hands go for flushes okay

1119
02:18:55,520 --> 02:19:00,080
i can do it 10 000 no discards by the way

1120
02:19:04,160 --> 02:19:10,800
so i can throw out a pair and hope to get a flush back i'll speak oh wait no hold on sorry

1121
02:19:10,800 --> 02:19:15,040
sorry sorry sorry sorry clubs pause we need clubs

1122
02:19:17,600 --> 02:19:25,920
oh you got a flush oh do i this is a wild card play it into that even though it doesn't play into

1123
02:19:25,920 --> 02:19:31,600
him i mean let's see how much money we get for spades flush

1124
02:19:31,920 --> 02:19:41,760
oh wow oh okay well that wild card i did not realize wild cards were that good

1125
02:19:42,640 --> 02:19:46,720
i take back everything i have ever said about wild cards even though i've said nothing about

1126
02:19:46,720 --> 02:19:53,920
them add double the rank of the lowest card no and no it's a suit so it prox everything that's

1127
02:19:53,920 --> 02:20:01,600
fantastic okay i assume standard is going to upgrade our lovely hologram so let's get a

1128
02:20:01,600 --> 02:20:07,120
little invest in my gating what's inside uh we have a wild card

1129
02:20:09,840 --> 02:20:15,760
very valuable i'm tempted to pick up the wild card yeah i agree i agree wild card and then

1130
02:20:15,760 --> 02:20:22,080
he's levelled up again he's now 2.5 no i'm interested to see if we could get a flush

1131
02:20:22,080 --> 02:20:29,200
celestial pack am i allowed to do it it's not going to take off our economy our interest

1132

1144
02:21:56,320 --> 02:22:03,680
for free is the question what is the joker we don't know it says 10 plus multiplier though

1145
02:22:03,680 --> 02:22:07,760
by default it could come in clutch

1146
02:22:10,320 --> 02:22:14,160
i'd start i'd start playing things out we kind of need money

1147

1158
02:23:38,640 --> 02:23:49,120
though it worked gamble works right do we do salis pack i think we need to start leveling up our

1159
02:23:49,120 --> 02:23:55,200
flushes streamer luck is back what is this joker called it's called ancient joker

1160
02:23:56,800 --> 02:24:00,560

1161
02:24:03,200 --> 02:24:11,520
surely okay jupiter is a flush and if it's all the same color you flush it okay

1162
02:24:12,000 --> 02:24:18,960
yeah so this is the one i want i'm just confirming because i i might have streamer brain

1163
02:24:22,240 --> 02:24:27,280
i want to check if i can yes okay we want jupiter okay just confirm it right we've

1164
02:24:27,280 --> 02:24:34,800

1168
02:24:51,360 --> 02:24:55,680
the five bucks joker in the shop does the boss blind make money off of it

1169
02:24:56,400 --> 02:25:03,360
erin eight bucks if played hand triggers the boss blind ability that's so specific i'm not sure i like

1170
02:25:03,360 --> 02:25:06,320
that we're flushed with streams

1171
02:25:08,560 --> 02:25:13,520
oh my soundboard isn't up i'm so sorry i just went but um i bet you didn't hear it but but um

02:25:48,960 --> 02:25:55,920
shiny can i see the boss blind oh whoops wait so we can skip it if we want we can change it

1178

seven bucks not bad all right you're not Jupiter so go away iron five dollars if three or more

1184
02:26:37,520 --> 02:26:44,080
face cards are discarded no standard i think we go standard again and level up our little friend

1185
02:26:44,080 --> 02:26:51,280
wherever he is wait is that the last one no here he is level up standard open both packs okay yes sir

1186
02:26:52,240 --> 02:26:56,800
ooh a king multiplier i think we want that right

1187
02:26:59,360 --> 02:27:05,600
king steal okay steal time okay now he's 2.75 okay and a turret let's see what's inside

1188
02:27:05,840 --> 02:27:15,040
we have increased the rank enhances two selected cards have bonus clubs gives the total sell value

1189
02:27:15,040 --> 02:27:21,360
of all the jokers currently 17 bucks so 17 bucks i don't want that either so full no

1190
02:27:22,720 --> 02:27:25,680
temperance easy money i am inclined to believe

1191
02:27:27,680 --> 02:27:33,280
temperance yep okay we've got we've just raised our economy artificially i'm very happy we will go

1192
02:27:33,280 --> 02:27:40,000
next i may not be able to talk all the time but i'm always here oh don't worry you can always

1193
02:27:40,000 --> 02:27:48,480
lurk if you're busy and stuff i know some of you listen at work i'm on to you oh my gosh are we

1194
02:27:48,480 --> 02:27:53,120
going to do it in one i'm not going to play the four on purpose because it's a wild card and i can

1195
02:27:53,120 --> 02:27:58,480
play it on anything i think we've done it in one though boop

1196
02:28:03,360 --> 02:28:11,920
oh my god brah 159 for that that's so good and we got 12 bucks feels good man

1197
02:28:12,160 --> 02:28:22,640
oh we got blueprint hold on you sound good right um plus 17 a booster or blueprint get

1198
02:28:22,640 --> 02:28:28,800
blueprint okay unanimously we are getting blueprint right incompatible that's fine joker on the right

1199
02:28:28,800 --> 02:28:41,360
so what him i put blueprint to copy ancient joker i mean i'm here for it i think you're

1200
02:28:41,360 --> 02:28:47,520
giving me a wild card pt i'm so sorry yeah well we won okay i hope so right and then standard pack

1201
02:28:47,520 --> 02:28:56,880
again to level up um hologram he'll be times three uh he'll be times three which is pretty good both

1202
02:28:56,880 --> 02:29:03,360
packs mummy okay recline thank you for your help i know i might be frustrating to watch but thank you

1203
02:29:03,360 --> 02:29:09,200
for your patience when you watch me play games because i'm not very smart um but i feel very

1204
02:29:09,200 --> 02:29:15,120
accepted even though i am a dumb dumb so thank you okay back to the game i don't want to get too

1205
02:29:15,120 --> 02:29:20,240
emotional because i feel very accepted as a stream when i'm dumb dumb but yes i take this

1206
02:29:20,240 --> 02:29:25,760
okay and then uh you want me to check out the joker pack i feel like all our jokers are pretty

1207
02:29:25,760 --> 02:29:31,840
good unless like crafty joker can probably get swapped out for something else do you want me to

1208
02:29:31,840 --> 02:29:39,840
pick up jumbo i wouldn't check out just save for economy for a good role let's see what we're up

1209
02:29:39,840 --> 02:29:46,640
against what are we up against gives a copy of the next selected tag and then three plus lose a dollar

1210
02:29:46,640 --> 02:29:56,640
per hand plate that's fine right now economy doesn't matter it puts us a negative one okay let's just

1211
02:29:56,640 --> 02:30:02,080
go next then i think we're i think we're doing okay we're going to see what a blueprint and ancient

1212
02:30:02,080 --> 02:30:07,520
do together i think we have a good joker set i think it's fair to move on okay let's move on let's

1213
02:30:07,520 --> 02:30:12,320
just keep our our money's to ourselves right what are we looking at here what would you like

1214
02:30:12,320 --> 02:30:23,360
you would like hearts that is okay i am going to play uh the full house just to get rid of these

1215
02:30:23,360 --> 02:30:27,920
cards and out the way and then we will roll for hearts okay but we will get a little cheeky

1216
02:30:27,920 --> 02:30:34,800
a little cheeky dollar we do for this as well yeah and i think that is the correct play the

1217
02:30:34,800 --> 02:30:45,280
correct choice oh well we didn't need it but we got money though oh what are you earn a dollar

1218
02:30:45,280 --> 02:30:53,520
for each nine in your deck at the current round uh you know i'll take it right put a little hi cat

1219
02:30:53,520 --> 02:31:02,400
no uh i don't think we need anything and less cloud nine eat earn a dollar it says plus 10 multi

1220
02:31:02,400 --> 02:31:07,680
which is doing more than the crafty joker i'm tempted to sell crafty joker what do we think

1221
02:31:07,680 --> 02:31:14,640
sell crafty joker to get a little plus 10 multiplier you can hover over the left most joker

1222
02:31:15,280 --> 02:31:24,800
hovering although nine is money but what would we do the left you want blue joker gone

1223
02:31:25,520 --> 02:31:29,920
two plus chips for each remaining card in the deck i feel like blue joker does more than

1224
02:31:29,920 --> 02:31:34,720
what crafty joker wait no you're a flush i'm an idiot i thought that was pears for some reason

1225
02:31:35,680 --> 02:31:38,720
sorry i'm sorry if we want to keep playing lose the blue

1226
02:31:40,160 --> 02:31:46,560
okay we'll lose the blue oh okay maybe wait

1227
02:31:50,000 --> 02:31:55,120
i don't really need the money is the 10 plus multiplier i'm more interested in i feel like

1228
02:31:55,120 --> 02:32:02,080
that's doing more than chips is it not accidental overkill honestly

1229
02:32:05,680 --> 02:32:10,640
he's foil but cloud nine scales are multi better 10 plus multi doesn't matter

1230
02:32:11,920 --> 02:32:15,840
the amount of chips ain't worth it just leave it while i just leave it as it is right i'm gonna

1231
02:32:15,840 --> 02:32:20,960
open up my little celestial pack whilst we all have a discussion oh come on give me a flush

1232
02:32:21,840 --> 02:32:27,440
this game does not like me right now i mean i guess give us two pears as a

1233
02:32:29,120 --> 02:32:36,960
default right let's see what tarot's got in store for us hmm bonus cards hearts or select two

1234
02:32:36,960 --> 02:32:41,840
cards convert the left into the right this one into the left into the right

1235
02:32:41,840 --> 02:32:51,760
who has got the most cards clubs i could honestly probably get rid of a club

1236
02:32:54,240 --> 02:33:03,600
death death a two into an ace or you shoulda we don't need that much flat multi you want the

1237
02:33:03,600 --> 02:33:13,200
suits to be equal okay okay the base from our flush level and the ancient jokers all we need

1238
02:33:13,200 --> 02:33:22,400
okay so what do you do select two cards and convert the left into the right sure yay we go to aces

1239
02:33:22,400 --> 02:33:28,880
why not uh right we're gonna just get cloud nine i'm just gonna leave everything as is you guys are

1240
02:33:28,880 --> 02:33:34,320
saying we're we're good to go so i very much convert one into a bonus like i thought we were

1241
02:33:34,320 --> 02:33:44,320
going to do that but yeah you have too many clubs out right we are doing spades any spades

1242
02:33:45,920 --> 02:33:53,920
spades spades spades we love to see it unfortunately we do not have a natural you went to densi

1243
02:33:53,920 --> 02:33:59,200
i think the blue is worse than the nine but we'll we can probably come across something else

1244
02:33:59,760 --> 02:34:05,040
just throw away i mean just makes all discard at all and do speed run yes

1245
02:34:09,280 --> 02:34:12,640
we have a wild card so we will just play it on

1246
02:34:13,520 --> 02:34:22,560
mount i know it's not the flush we want but it's not the flush we want but let's play it

1247
02:34:23,520 --> 02:34:31,520
and we get a little penny on top 130 000 we got a penny we we got extra money we got 11 for that

1248
02:34:31,520 --> 02:34:39,200
what are you a steel card or spades i think our spades are really fine it's really thinking what

1249
02:34:39,200 --> 02:34:46,240
we don't like uh we could do a steel card i mean don't really see why not choose two the playing

1250
02:34:46,240 --> 02:34:51,440
cards to add okay so that's gonna level him up spade flush would cost us the clean money

1251
02:34:51,520 --> 02:34:54,640
who cares at this point actually yeah you're kind of right i feel like we've got enough

1252
02:34:54,640 --> 02:35:01,040
economy going on what are you you have a chance one in five chance for a plus 20

1253
02:35:01,040 --> 02:35:07,680
ah the queen money was better lucky money yeah take lucky money okay i'll take

1254
02:35:08,720 --> 02:35:16,000
zui 69 oh you stop oh can i take them both oh no it's like okay and then a nine

1255
02:35:16,080 --> 02:35:21,680
take this okay so now he's 3.5 and then he's what about to be four

1256
02:35:23,600 --> 02:35:29,280
we have a jack multi and a queen i assume is the the dream team

1257
02:35:31,600 --> 02:35:37,840
i'm going for it if it's wrong you may hang draw and quarter me okay and then i'll buy the steel

1258
02:35:39,040 --> 02:35:44,320
and i'll hold on to the steel and we don't really need a consumable slot to be honest

1259
02:35:46,480 --> 02:35:51,920
uh jack of clubs and money queen money right what are we up against is the question

1260
02:35:52,640 --> 02:35:55,920
upcoming lose a dollar every hand plays

1261
02:35:59,680 --> 02:36:05,760
i see a wild wild card what would you like you would like diamonds you most certainly can have

1262
02:36:05,760 --> 02:36:11,760
diamonds so i am going to purposely get rid of you to give us a turret and we are going to roll

1263
02:36:11,760 --> 02:36:20,640
for diamonds discard we've got the hermit doubles money i mean she i'll take it right

1264
02:36:20,640 --> 02:36:24,800
diamonds one two three four five let's go

1265
02:36:32,240 --> 02:36:39,360
that's that's silly that's silly one million for that hand that is so silly

1266
02:36:39,360 --> 02:36:47,600
it gives the total sell value so what spend two dollars to make 18

1267
02:36:51,040 --> 02:36:56,160
oh this is getting so silly i'm here for it right sure let's see what's in the standard pack

1268
02:36:57,600 --> 02:37:04,080
what are we looking at money or money right who is the weakest diamond oh

1269
02:37:04,880 --> 02:37:08,480
hearts is actually getting pretty far behind i might be better off playing him

1270
02:37:09,280 --> 02:37:14,640
yeah i think we're gonna have to try and even out our hearts a bit more and then let's see turret

1271
02:37:14,640 --> 02:37:27,360
what's going on over here bonus cards an exchange or a wild card okay i want to make a wild card on

1272
02:37:27,360 --> 02:37:39,360
hearts a heart's wild card i'm going for wild wild card since we need to keep so wild the ace yeah

1273
02:37:41,040 --> 02:37:50,960
wild card uh the wild card the ace which is a diamond yeah sure wild is why not wild are good

1274
02:37:50,960 --> 02:37:56,400
yes i would like a lot of well oh i got a joker unlocked oh you can't see it my hair is in the

1275
02:37:56,400 --> 02:38:02,720
way oh i'm so big my greed says money seems coffee but wild is good no oh did i mess up

1276
02:38:03,760 --> 02:38:09,920
i could have done that seal card while i was there but anyway you smeared unlocked you smeared

1277
02:38:09,920 --> 02:38:19,600
unlocked is the name of the card we could re-ros re-ros re-roll the blind what is an extra large

1278
02:38:19,600 --> 02:38:24,960
blind well considering we make that in one go i'm not really worried i think we actually have won

1279
02:38:24,960 --> 02:38:31,040
this one feels good man okay we're just gonna play i'm quite happy with what we've got if you are

1280
02:38:31,600 --> 02:38:37,360
do you want me to re-roll maybe we should re-roll and try and get i recognize that joker

1281
02:38:37,360 --> 02:38:44,480
anywhere it's so good for flush bills yeah okay what we're looking at bonus cards sure i don't

1282
02:38:44,480 --> 02:38:49,440
i don't see why not oh we've got Fibonacci long time no see Fibonacci unfortunately no we're not

1283
02:38:49,440 --> 02:38:56,080
using you but um you're a very good card in general take the last joker okay all cards are

1284
02:38:56,080 --> 02:39:02,640
considered faces sorry caps don't worry i'm excited too i'm just excited as you are to play this game

1285
02:39:03,600 --> 02:39:07,600
i don't sound it because i was raging earlier but i'm having a good time not worth it

1286
02:39:10,560 --> 02:39:18,560
Fibonacci Fibonacci lose the blue joker for it okay it's blue joker we will say thank you

1287
02:39:19,280 --> 02:39:28,560
all face cards work with smiley oh okay wait played face cards give five plus

1288
02:39:29,200 --> 02:39:37,200
but if it considers all cards are considered a face so smiley in parodolia not the blue joker sorry

1289
02:39:40,480 --> 02:39:46,800
these aren't good enough to swap out yet we have better chip sources than four joker that is blue

1290
02:39:48,880 --> 02:39:52,000
no blue prints too it will be when i get rid of blue print

1291
02:39:55,680 --> 02:40:01,440
they'll leave it that just leave it i mean we're winning we're literally doing like 100 a pot right

1292
02:40:01,440 --> 02:40:06,640
sorry we're doing 100 a pot we're more than fine i know i don't need that right next next next

1293
02:40:07,280 --> 02:40:13,040
i think we're doing fine we're doing fine i'm i'm not too worried right you would like clubs

1294
02:40:13,040 --> 02:40:22,400
we have two clubs and no more uh right so what get rid of all this we don't have a wild card

1295
02:40:26,720 --> 02:40:29,440
oh this is what i'm worried about when the game starts doing this to me

1296
02:40:34,720 --> 02:40:40,960
oh i don't like when the game does this to me you want clubs i have two clubs and no more

1297
02:40:41,040 --> 02:40:46,240
so i just keep throwing them away keep the queen we have to continue dig dig dig i'm digging a hole

1298
02:40:47,040 --> 02:40:52,320
i know but we'll have two discards left let's just keep fishing okay discard diamond queen and keep

1299
02:40:52,320 --> 02:41:03,200
digging discard diamond queen oh i really don't like the way this is shaping two is enough wait

1300
02:41:03,200 --> 02:41:10,480
what do you need me to do i'm sure confusion what do you do you make a steel card all the red cards

1301
02:41:10,480 --> 02:41:17,680

1303
02:41:22,560 --> 02:41:28,880
into rotation i'm sorry if i did the wrong move but i have one discard left this is exactly what i

1304
02:41:28,880 --> 02:41:38,640
didn't want to happen and it happened look how many spades are sitting in the deck 17 spades are

1305
02:41:38,640 --> 02:41:46,240
lurking in the shadows okay the odds of us not rolling is astronomical this has to work

1306
02:41:50,000 --> 02:41:54,480
this game has nothing but the audacity are you serious

1307
02:41:57,040 --> 02:42:04,640
16 spades sitting hiding in that deck and i have to play a fishy two appears

1308
02:42:08,960 --> 02:42:15,920
we have a full house play the trash i know you guys are saying full house but if we do a club we

1309
02:42:15,920 --> 02:42:26,320
win we do a club flush we win mommy you'll get 10k tomorrow really i've not been uploading any ace

1310
02:42:26,320 --> 02:42:32,240
smart though how i don't know how i'm getting traction i don't know i don't know if the full

1311
02:42:32,240 --> 02:42:43,840
house will be enough ace ace 4 4 4 no that's rub it sorry i uh i right let me just be bad we

1312
02:42:43,840 --> 02:42:48,800
have three rounds we can play let me just be let me be transparent let me be bad at the game okay

1313
02:42:48,800 --> 02:42:58,320
let me just submit that's what i want okay one two three four five i want to know

1314
02:43:00,640 --> 02:43:03,840

1315
02:43:03,840 --> 02:43:11,360
oh right one two three four five yeah flush yeah

1316
02:43:17,600 --> 02:43:29,840
oh my god 4.7 million no that's my highest ever hit 4.7 million

1317
02:43:29,920 --> 02:43:45,680
no way that's fantastic oh my gosh oh my gosh golly oh my gosh golly that's sorry that's so cool

1318
02:43:46,960 --> 02:43:49,520
choose a tarot card right we're gonna start using these

1319
02:43:51,040 --> 02:43:57,200
uh a steel card let's just shove it on anything i guess right there's less

1320
02:43:57,760 --> 02:44:00,800
uh the hearts and the spades have actually evened up what do you want next you want a

1321
02:44:00,800 --> 02:44:06,240
spade of course you want the the smallest one right bonus cards ace and a king become a bonus

1322
02:44:06,240 --> 02:44:12,560
focus focus you are a bonus that's fine uh chariot steel card what do we put the steel on

1323
02:44:12,560 --> 02:44:20,240
flushes really are okay great cards but hard to find it hold chariot for an emergency understood

1324
02:44:20,320 --> 02:44:28,560
right we have planets luck enhancing to two lucky cards i wouldn't mind luck luck is kind of fun

1325
02:44:31,120 --> 02:44:35,440
diamond we've already got enough diamonds on the deck mommy is our biggest hitter ever

1326
02:44:35,440 --> 02:44:39,920
but you're winning so hard you could just be one harder okay let's do luck forget if we roll a lucky

1327
02:44:39,920 --> 02:44:47,600
card i'm like although i'm here for it not steel glass that's not glass like steel

1328
02:44:49,760 --> 02:44:55,280
just use luck or we could roll for planet but we might not get anything we want that's the problem

1329
02:44:55,280 --> 02:45:06,080
with planet just do luck okay let's do come back okay and then re-roll three of a kind we don't need

1330
02:45:06,080 --> 02:45:14,320
three of a kind we don't need one in four chance no one more re-roll one plus hand size honestly

1331
02:45:14,320 --> 02:45:25,200
all flushes and streets can be made with four car reeflings reeflings is this the card we want

1332
02:45:28,160 --> 02:45:35,520
is this the card we won yes you want it we want it we don't need it we always get the flush

1333
02:45:35,520 --> 02:45:38,240
well only because we're throwing so much as such a way

1334
02:45:40,800 --> 02:45:43,120
follow your heart scrawny i feel like

1335
02:45:45,280 --> 02:45:47,440
um what would we trade for it though

1336
02:45:50,560 --> 02:45:57,040
i think crafty joker he only gives 80 plus chips you he gives more chips blue joker gives more

1337
02:45:57,040 --> 02:46:03,040
than crafty four card flushes also don't score as well not that you need to believe in the heart of

1338
02:46:03,200 --> 02:46:07,040
car

1339
02:46:08,160 --> 02:46:13,440
blue joker makes probably makes more than crafty crafty or blue doesn't matter both are shite

1340
02:46:13,440 --> 02:46:21,680
sell crafty okay thank you crafty you have been fantastic wait what am i being an idiot

1341
02:46:21,680 --> 02:46:29,600
all flushes and streets can be made with four cards let's see what are gonna happen because

1342
02:46:29,600 --> 02:46:36,320
that's very unique um okay next round what are you

1343
02:46:39,360 --> 02:46:45,600
okay what would you like you would like space you'll never guess i've rolled one space so if i

1344
02:46:45,600 --> 02:46:53,360
play oh i don't really want to play that what get rid of them because i don't want this is a 1.5 if

1345
02:46:53,360 --> 02:47:01,280
it stays in my hand can you show your deck all yours baby the four only gives you consistent

1346
02:47:01,280 --> 02:47:04,880
it could be a lifesaver ditch all but the seal

1347
02:47:07,360 --> 02:47:14,080
and queen yes agreed east guard we'll go for a diamond flush even though it's not exactly what

1348
02:47:14,080 --> 02:47:23,520
we want but so that work see it counts as a flush so what happens if i play a four only flush

1349
02:47:26,480 --> 02:47:36,800
oh it didn't like that it didn't like that um curious i'll keep that in mind it didn't like it

1350
02:47:36,800 --> 02:47:43,440
but it could save us in a in a very rough time oh well okay we should just go for the flush of

1351
02:47:43,440 --> 02:47:51,280
whatever card it's asking for that is insane retrigger each blade multi multi well we might be

1352
02:47:51,280 --> 02:47:58,080
able to get uh was it jupiter three of a kind two pair four of a kind this game really does not like

1353
02:47:58,080 --> 02:48:04,480
me i got a sport 5k well off which is pretty strong to be the suit with that ancient joker yeah

1354
02:48:04,800 --> 02:48:12,800
yeah oh just grab any old thing and then another one just because we can flush

1355
02:48:14,480 --> 02:48:20,160
wow black holes hidden in here but we play flushes because they're all the same colors

1356
02:48:20,160 --> 02:48:25,600
so we flush it down the toilet that's right that's how i remember what flushes oh no you guys are

1357
02:48:25,600 --> 02:48:39,040
saying black hole oh i'm sorry i'm sorry i got so focused on the thing that's fine we're doing

1358
02:48:39,040 --> 02:48:45,680
flushes anyway okay extra large veins let's go what would you like you would like diamonds today

1359
02:48:45,680 --> 02:48:53,120
oh you'll never guess what card i didn't pull some of the fucking diamonds i think just

1360
02:48:54,400 --> 02:49:03,280
what throw everything for diamonds wait no hold on what am i doing there's already a suit in here

1361
02:49:03,280 --> 02:49:12,640
should i just play the suit i still have three hands anyway club flush yeah i feel like we have

1362
02:49:12,640 --> 02:49:19,040
enough rounds for it i know i can get a turret if i discard him but me oh no destroy the ace okay

1363
02:49:19,040 --> 02:49:26,240
i'll destroy this discard the ace and these and see what happens when did i get temperance

1364
02:49:26,240 --> 02:49:34,640
gives me money okay this is what i didn't want we are getting the diamonds but yeah now we're up

1365
02:49:34,720 --> 02:49:35,360
Greek

1366
02:49:40,720 --> 02:49:46,800
nine how do you spot that that's insane what did you spot nine nine nine

1367
02:49:49,760 --> 02:49:58,000
queen and five player throw a player discard i don't know any of these words just enjoy the

1368
02:49:58,000 --> 02:50:04,400
accent let it let it flow through you how to see clubs in a scotch accent clubs discard them

1369
02:50:05,600 --> 02:50:16,480
could make some dosh i don't know but play them okay fuck it up now if we don't roll diamond

1370
02:50:16,480 --> 02:50:21,680
yeah i was gonna say this game's target and this one two three four five just a double check diamond

1371
02:50:21,680 --> 02:50:28,560
let's go let's go leave it to me i see someone's got real addicted to this game it's such a good

1372
02:50:28,560 --> 02:50:36,880
game i love it oh my god two million are you joking we made two million on that that's ridiculous

1373
02:50:39,440 --> 02:50:44,800
it does nothing no redeem it please i want it i've still not unlocked what's inside that

1374
02:50:45,360 --> 02:50:51,280
sure give us money 86 bucks planets let's see what you got for me give me jipper

1375
02:50:51,280 --> 02:50:59,520
flush that's exactly what we want yes wait cells are for eight she redeemed literally all that

1376
02:50:59,520 --> 02:51:07,760
frustration and then it paid off oh fancy right what are we looking at we have we need a heart

1377
02:51:07,760 --> 02:51:14,400
or a spade to start even and stuff up so i guess a spade ten plus money creates a planet card for

1378
02:51:14,400 --> 02:51:23,680
final if it's hell sure oh you want you want spade you want spade two viewers are streaming their

1379
02:51:23,680 --> 02:51:32,160
addiction right now sad that they fell that i love that ace diamond ace diamond for the target cards

1380
02:51:33,040 --> 02:51:39,440
we don't have a flat multi either ace is fine i was gonna do the spade to try and even up because

1381
02:51:40,240 --> 02:51:46,240
uh spades are 14 in the hand which is a bit hard if the multiplier asks for it

1382
02:51:46,240 --> 02:51:55,680
it's last ante ace spade yeah we're at 4.5 um we trigger all cards for the next ten hands

1383
02:51:55,680 --> 02:52:03,040
well i don't have room for you but re-roll weren't you when blind is selected destroy joker to the

1384
02:52:03,120 --> 02:52:11,520
right and permanently double its value yeah re-roll none of these are good one more re-roll boom

1385
02:52:12,880 --> 02:52:20,640
judgment creates a random joker bonus card why not why not each played king of diamonds gives

1386
02:52:22,640 --> 02:52:25,520
keep rolling is this the last round i'm not going crazy

1387
02:52:25,520 --> 02:52:35,840
oh very large blind 300 we are we make that in one go i'm not sure i'm nervous for this one

1388
02:52:36,400 --> 02:52:41,280
well i just sell everything so long as we stay over 25 bucks it doesn't matter okay one more

1389
02:52:42,480 --> 02:52:52,400
four of a kind no discarded no right one more i'll come on oh flush very lucky fushy

1390
02:52:53,360 --> 02:53:04,240
okay well one more and no 29 and then four bucks some more we're to spend on okay wild cat oh

1391
02:53:06,080 --> 02:53:13,280
uh okay well you okay it's fine it's fine it's fine if we have four spare yeah okay what would you

1392
02:53:13,280 --> 02:53:19,280
like you would like hearts cards you are more than welcome to have hearts cards uh i just need to

1393
02:53:19,280 --> 02:53:30,000
discard for them because yeah these are all terrible actually lose chariot for wild carry

1394
02:53:30,560 --> 02:53:39,120
um as does the bonus card permanent effect work yeah i'll just make space okay um right if you

1395
02:53:39,120 --> 02:53:49,600
want hearts i will get rid of everything for you my lady um discard everything yeah i'm with you

1396
02:53:49,600 --> 02:53:57,600
there wow game tell me that you don't like me it's fine hearts one two three four five discard

1397
02:53:58,560 --> 02:54:02,800
there we go one two three four five go

1398
02:54:09,760 --> 02:54:16,640
oh my god okay i'm not worried about winning this one i'm gonna be honest i think we won on this deck

1399
02:54:16,640 --> 02:54:23,520
finally won on this deck what are you a joker gains four chips okay let's see what's in the packs

1400
02:54:24,320 --> 02:54:30,720
unfortunately not what we want to just shove on anything straight flush because the four

1401
02:54:30,720 --> 02:54:34,800
jokers honestly it's funny because it was a straight flush because you only needed four oh

1402
02:54:34,800 --> 02:54:43,920
oops i forgot how many we've got 14 we need another hearts and all honesty but i mean it's all right

1403
02:54:44,720 --> 02:54:51,600
we can just take it i'm not really too worried now that we have the other thing um now one more

1404
02:54:51,680 --> 02:55:01,680
re-roll urinus no no you stinky three clubs straight flush gosh this game doesn't like me

1405
02:55:02,400 --> 02:55:09,760
all right one more round before the boss you would like the clubs i most certainly can arrange

1406
02:55:09,760 --> 02:55:16,800
that for you i have a wild card right you you you you and you out you're all clubs you're a wild card

1407
02:55:16,800 --> 02:55:19,600
