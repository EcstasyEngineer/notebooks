1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,440
Right. I know I'm up early, but YouTube kicked me out of my own account again so I can't

2
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:15,100
type in the comments. So obviously the only logical thing is to start off streaming seven

3
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:26,640
minutes early as usual. Why is there no challenge thing that I break out?

4
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:33,640
Am I a broken app? I think I've broken chat on screen.

5
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:48,120
Ah, how? How? I've broken chat on screen. How have I done that? I can't get on.

6
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:54,200
See YouTube changing all its wee hings in there. Oh that's me. See YouTube. Oh that's

7
00:00:54,200 --> 00:01:00,720
me complaining. Oh sorry. Oh sorry. That's me complaining. Good morning, good evening,

8
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:05,080
good afternoon. I'm starting five minutes early because YouTube's a stinky doodlehead

9
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:08,720
and signed me out of my account so I couldn't talk in the freaking pre-chat for a whole

10
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:12,520
five extra minutes so I was like, no, I'm booting up right now because I'm raging. I'm

11
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:23,440
absolutely raging. And I've freaking broken the chat. The chat doesn't display. So we're

12
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:34,520
going to have to do it manually, old school manually. Ready for this? Okay, hold on, hold

13
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:47,520
on. That's me. Nope, that's me. Why? Capture. Capture the pop out chat. Okay, stop it.

14
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:54,520
Look, it's you. We're having to do it. Fuck it, we'll do it live. I was literally having

15
00:01:54,520 --> 00:02:03,920
to do it old school. That's so terrible. That's the best I got, okay? It's the best I got

16
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:10,320
with what I have. Is it working? Okay, I was like, we're on the telly basically. The only

17
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:23,200
way I can do it. I don't know if this game also is a game where we play it with the controller

18
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:31,480
or not. I don't know if this is a controller game or not. So I'm going to try a medicine

19
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:40,120
keyboard, but I think you can play controller. What would you kind of continue to do? Okay,

20
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:49,000
I will get marshmallows because I had a few questions. Snippets, listen up. Possibly

21
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:56,920
Yandere tomorrow. Yandere is more role play tomorrow. Possibly Snippets, okay? I am in

22
00:02:56,920 --> 00:03:00,920
the process of getting a manager in that deals with everyone's Patreon audio. So everyone

23
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:06,720
should have two Patreon audios by the time I'm finished with today, except for me because

24
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:13,440
we sacrificed myself for the short term for the long term. The girls success is my number

25
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:30,720
one, okay? I literally said I can't even send a message in the long term. I've got another

26
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:35,800
eight hours sleep. So the mental clarity is returning. I'm not even kidding. The mental

27
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:42,400
clarity is returning. It's rather strange. I'm not used to it. Right, okay. I'll try and

28
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:45,800
avoid the incable questions because we are just playing video. We are just playing video.

29
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:51,600
We are just playing video. We are just playing video. We are just playing video. Are you squiddin'

30
00:03:51,600 --> 00:04:00,000
me right now? Glesion, thank you for the extended membership. Hello, early story. Would you kindly

31
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:05,040
have fun today? I'm so making a would you kindly. Someone actually said I should play

32
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:11,440
Bioshock 1 and I'm like, you know what? I might. But the only thing I'm not looking forward to,

33
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:16,480
Sully Dean, as you interrupt me. Thank you Sully Dean for the extended membership.

34
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:21,680
Loves me Bioshock 2 gameplay. So I've not played it, right? I've not played it. I've played

35
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:26,240
Bioshock 1, right? But I might play it on this channel again, right? You need to forgive me. What's

36
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:32,720
going on? Thanks for all the fun streams. Big fan of the big thighs. Oh you let go. Awesome table to

37
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:38,320
catch it live but the VOD is delightful. The VOD got 18 plus. I don't know if it's still 18 plus.

38
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:44,080
I sent away for them to not make it 18 plus, but it might still be 18 plus. Thank you Tim

39
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:54,560
Shuttle for the tip. Yes, I'm a bit like, what's going on now? But anyway,

40
00:04:55,520 --> 00:05:00,720
Hi, that one's a bit of a wet dream. So I can't read that one out.

41
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:09,760
Someone actually asked me. Hi, Strony. It's not very positive, but who goes there? Ken Quispy!

42
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:15,200
Would you kindly be your mummy until the end of our days? Bro, you're gonna be on your death bed,

43
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:20,080
you're gonna be like, mmm, mummy. Damn straight, you better be a bit of a main break to that point.

44
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:24,400
18 plus because I miss a cake. Would you kindly kiss me right now?

45
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:33,200
Someone said, hey, Strony, this isn't a very positive question. Do you have anyone in your

46
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:39,520
family that you only care about? That you care about only because they're family? For me, it would

47
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:44,800
be my ma hen because she's not that nice. And he kind of went on to be like, oh, he's nasty or that.

48
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:49,440
And I don't know if I said this story or not. I had a family member reach out to me.

49
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:55,440
You know, I didn't talk prior and I was like, oh, they're finally like taking an interest in me.

50
00:05:55,440 --> 00:06:03,840
How nice, how kind. And basically, they messaged back and forth because he has a stepchild and he

51
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:09,200
was like, oh, the stepchild's interested in becoming a YouTuber. And I was like, oh, just make sure,

52
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:14,320
delete all social media under legal name, make sure you're not posting any memes that are inappropriate

53
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:19,840
that have racist stuff and all that type stuff. Because you know what is like, we're hooligans,

54
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:25,600
college 80 days, blah, blah, blah. And I was like, oh, that was such a nice conversation. That was

55
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:32,000
lovely getting into like the nitty gritty and all that. And then the family member turned around

56
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:40,320
and asked for 20,000 Great British Pounds from me. So that was really nice. Just had that lovely

57
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:47,200
conversation only to be asked for a lot of money. And I was like, ah, that's why you're talking to

58
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:56,880
me. And of course, when I said no, they no longer talk to me. Yeah. I literally, I literally, I was

59
00:06:56,880 --> 00:07:04,560
just so disappointed, so so disappointed. Oh yeah, yeah, 20,000 Great British Pounds. And I was like,

60
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:10,320
ah, no, surprise, no, I'm not giving you that money. Because I know you're not one, I know you're

61
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:15,920
not going to give me it back to what the fuck. And three, they were like, oh, but make sure you don't

62
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:21,600
make sure you don't tell anyone else from the family because it's a bit embarrassing asking for money.

63
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:26,560
There's a difference between asking for 100 quid and knowing that I'll never get it paid back

64
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:34,400
type thing and just be like, oh, here's 100 quid. And then 20,000 Great British Pounds,

65
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:42,800
which is like what, I don't know, 30 grand United States dollar I do. I'd probably say that because

66
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:49,120
there's no actual real like relationship. And it just felt, it just felt really bad because I was so

67
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:54,400
excited to be like, oh my God, your child is interested in doing YouTube right here's all the

68
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:59,360
steps they need to do and make sure you have fun and you know, don't regret it because you'll regret

69
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:03,680
it if you never go for it. I was like so excited. And then it comes out of nowhere. Can I get 20

70
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:10,000
grand by the way? And I'm like, oh, you let me put my heart and soul into all these messages saying

71
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:17,600
how fun it can be. And that was it. Anyway, handle me sorry. No, you're not late. I'm early. I got

72
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:22,160
my YouTube account again. So I couldn't talk in chat. So I was like, boom, come up early.

73
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:31,840
And this is my whenever late reminder, I love what you do. And I want you to keep up the excellent

74
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:35,120
work. Oh, I'm glad you think it's excellent. I feel like I've been doing rubbish recently.

75
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:40,240
You've always you are you are and you've always been my favorite VTuber and ASMR. I said, love,

76
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:43,360
love, love you. I love you. Thank you for the kind word.

77
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:55,120
Hi. Good morning. Good evening. Good afternoon. Who recommended happy sugar life? That anime

78
00:08:55,120 --> 00:09:02,400
seems kind of off brand. So I typed in one shot enemies like 12 episode enemies. That was the

79
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:08,000
most highly recommended 12 shot. So we're just gonna go for it. Look, if I like it, I like it. If

80
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:14,160
I don't, I don't, we can put it in the category and be like s to your category or a or all that jazz.

81
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:18,960
So we're going to give happy sugar life a shot. Then you worry too much. Then you worry too much.

82
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:24,480
You're doing great as always. Thank you. Possibly bad news cuddles.

83
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:30,400
In November, Apple will start demanding that users sign up via phone will be subjected to a fee.

84
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:36,560
Yes, do not sign up to anyone's Patreon via iPhone. You are throwing money

85
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:43,520
into the void that we will never see. So don't do it. Just as a reminder in general as well,

86
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:51,520
when you do give your girl $5 on Patreon, whether it's my gen mates, any of them, please remember

87
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:58,160
that they don't actually get the full $5 as well as taxes means they don't get the full $5. So

88
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:06,080
just keep that in mind when when I did that short and people were like, oh my god, you made $12,000

89
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:11,520
in a month. I was like, please remember, I don't actually get to keep all that. I don't just get

90
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:18,560
to walk away with that. There's quite a lot of investing and then taxes and then, you know,

91
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:22,240
it keeps going. So just remember, they don't get to keep all of it. Some people kind of forget that

92
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:28,480
little detail. Hi, strongy. Hi, reflin. Cowardly reflin here asking a question on behalf of the

93
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:33,520
snowberries. I was going to super about chicken. No, don't give me your freaking money for a question.

94
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:39,760
As you probably guess, it's about the data name change that I see indicated that should be asked

95
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:46,560
to you. I'm going to address it. I see can still say data. Okay, when you go on memberships,

96
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:54,160
harem emotes, harem membership, refling emotes, refling membership, bleeding hearts emotes,

97
00:10:54,160 --> 00:11:01,040
bleeding hearts thingy. I see can still say data to her heart's content. I don't know where the fuck

98
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:08,000
any of this is coming from. She can still say data. I literally wrote data into her scripts. I don't

99
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:13,440
know what's going on with the whole data thing. If things are exploding over in the snowberry

100
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:17,680
side of things, I don't know. I think you guys are giving in to brain worms or some shit because

101
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:26,240
I don't know what to tell you. She wanted to change the name to Creamy Unpass and I said to her,

102
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:33,680
give me some time because YouTube had to approve the name change because, and we can still call you

103
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:40,960
pop, like YouTube had to approve the name change and I think if we changed it to Creamy Unpass,

104
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:45,600
it would get denied and then it would pause her Patreon, her Patreon. It would pause her

105
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:52,160
membership's temporary, temporarily, which is really dangerous. I need, I used to have her income or,

106
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:58,960
you know, like, I don't know what the, she can still say data. I don't know what the problem is.

107
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:03,840
Why does no one think that she can't say data? I literally wrote it into a script. Just look

108
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:14,480
on everyone's channel. Membership, it goes pinpal, emotes, pinpal, member tier. And now everyone

109
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:24,320
is uniform. That's it. That's literally it, okay? Like, AC was getting shagged for it so I said,

110
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:28,400
you know, you know, just tweet out and they can come to me but to be honest, I'm gonna be honest,

111
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:32,720
I thought you guys would figure it out yourselves. My hands are up right now in person. I thought

112
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:37,600
you'd be able to figure it out among, among yourselves. Hmm. There's some sort of correlation

113
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:42,160
between the bleeding hearts, tears and all these tears together, okay? Rather bra moment. I have

114
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:46,640
to admit, she can still say data as much as she wants. I don't fucking say, I don't dictate none of

115
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:51,600
that shit that happens on stream, okay? I don't, I don't dictate none of that shit, okay? Like,

116
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:56,320
the only thing I've dictated so far was as it is or maybe you slip on the league streams.

117
00:12:56,800 --> 00:13:02,560
That's the only thing I've dictated. So, fucking, y'all need to, y'all need to pause

118
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:11,520
champ because, whoa, what the fuck? Okay, do we understand? Is that yes? Does everyone

119
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:17,520
comprehend what I've just communicated? And then that's it put to bed, okay? It's a bit of

120
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:24,160
brain worms. That's fine. Brain worms are natural, but just, just so we're all clear.

121
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:29,920
Hey, she can say data as much as she wants. I don't, I literally wrote it into a script for her,

122
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:37,600
okay? And, and the tier names are all the same for everyone now. It goes, oops, and membership.

123
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:45,040
Okay, okay, we're all in the same, what? Instrictions unclear. I'm pregnant! What? That's not how it works.

124
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:56,240
I'm sorry, I'm sorry for that time. What time? I don't mean to look like a jerk.

125
00:13:57,040 --> 00:14:02,800
The only jerk you look like is you better jerk off now! I don't know what you mean. See, you've

126
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:07,680
got brain worms, clearly. What do you thought? You're not a jerk. You're a jerk. You're a jerk,

127
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:11,120
I know. You're a jerk. You're preaching to the choir. I'm not sure how many still

128
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:17,760
brain worms are here. Well, I don't know. But, but I don't dictate that shit. And I'm proud how

129
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:22,880
you're doing with the whole velar thing. Have, have you 20K, by the way? I did have 20K

130
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:31,760
reflinks, which is unbelievable. You're unbelievable. Okay, I hydrate with my teeth.

131
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:39,760
It's almost room temperature. Delicious. Yes, I'm very blessed to say I have almost 21K

132
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:44,720
There is a manager coming in for Patreon, which means I can focus on my reflinks stuff.

133
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:50,800
My responsibilities are getting less and I don't have to do anything other than my own content.

134
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:04,720
But yes, literally, I am getting so close. I'm on the cusp of greatness where I don't have to do a

135
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:10,720
single thing. Don't have to write script. I don't have to edit for the girls. I don't have to deal

136
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:17,120
with the Patreon uploads. And you know what that leaves me? All the time in the world to milk

137
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:23,280
my reflinks. I'm not even kidding. That's literally what we're doing. Like, I have finally, I've got

138
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:30,320
my mojo back. I'm posting some cheeky things on the alt-wear. Less stress and bound. Literally,

139
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:35,040
I've slept eight hours. That's two days in a row that I've had good sleep. And I think it's

140
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:41,840
because all my responsibilities are being lifted off of me. So, life is fucking magnificent,

141
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:49,920
reflint. I fucking love you. Everything's fucking amazing. Emma broke the game. She literally gets

142
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:55,680
more subscribers when she's out. Emma's fucking short, got a quarter of a million views, which is

143
00:15:55,680 --> 00:16:00,960
fun. Fucking fantastic. She has three more on the way that are being brood, but the editor needs some

144
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:07,280
time. Cheeky editor. Cheeky editor that I want. He's in education. Get out of education right now,

145
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:12,640
just so you can become a shorts farm for Veal or I can't believe you're in education. Oh, shocking

146
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:22,640
behavior. Mummy has more time to gloop or giggle sticks. So, okay. Hi, Strawny. Fun fact incoming.

147
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:29,600
Did you know that I love you very much? I love you. Yeah, I'm on hyper today. Sorry if I'm too

148
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:36,320
hyper. Should we be making a tinfoil hat for the Bioshock stream? I don't know, should we?

149
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:43,280
What kind of plot is it? I've not played Bioshock. I've not played Bioshock.

150
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:44,720
Woooo.

151
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:54,480
Hi, Strawny. Just curious if you already know what stronzo means in Italian. A dinny. Hold on.

152
00:16:54,480 --> 00:17:00,720
Time to open up Google Translate. Google Translate. I swear to god if it means like a goby or

153
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:14,000
something like that. Zettet ronzo. It's a... My name means asshole. What? It literally says Italian

154
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:23,680
detected stronzo, English asshole. No, my fucking nickname is ass. I mean, it's really on par for

155
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:33,520
me because I like being over. No, stronzo. Cazzo menta putana. Fucking means arsehole.

156
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:46,400
All right, enough stalling. Enough stalling. Oh god, can you hear the background music? Oh,

157
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:53,120
I was rather loud. Hold on. Let's pop that down a little bit. Pop that down a little bit.

158
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:58,160
Well, at least it's correct to all discover something new. Mummy is a big daddy. There's

159
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:06,800
a joke to be made in that. Right. I am so new to shores I've never played them in my life before.

160
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:15,520
Don't worry, I picked legendary mode. Press control to use a first aid kit.

161
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:22,240
Okay, I feel like this is definitely a... Oh shit, my fucking pin's not connected. Hold on,

162
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:28,480
I've pinned my fucking controller in. Sorry, I'm a controller clear. Oh my god, Lore.

163
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:36,640
Is this too loud? I'm playing on hard mode clearly.

164
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:52,640
Knock, knock, re-blend. I'm coming for your ink. Oh! Is that too low?

165
00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:02,640
Hello. Let's go out to play, daddy. Bye.

166
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,640
We're in the rapture.

167
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:17,280
Oh.

168
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:24,880
Yeah, let's play.

169
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:31,360
Me with a cola.

170
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:39,680
Need Adam? I get to be the daddy?

171
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:51,680
Wait, they don't mind me? Oh right, I was going to say, did they not mind me being a big daddy?

172
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:52,960
Daddy!

173
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:01,840
Whoa!

174
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:09,840
I'm gonna bleed.

175
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:40,160
There we are. He's perfectly safe now. This is not your daughter. Do you understand?

176
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:48,720
What? Her name is Eleanor, and she is mine. Now, Neil, please.

177
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:56,880
Eh? Remove your helmet. She's under my protection.

178
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:06,080
Now, take out the pistol. No! Place it against your head.

179
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:12,800
No, no, no, no, no, that's my wing.

180
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:16,000
Fire.

181
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:29,840
That lamb is going down. What the fuck? That was my wing. I had to protect her.

182
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:39,840
I'm sorry, I want to turn down the game volume.

183
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:42,960
She went, mm-hmm. That was so loud.

184
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:49,280
Who goes there? Identify yourself.

185
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:57,600
Happy little game, bro. I'm already ready. Great. What the fuck? Eleanor, my wing.

186
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:01,120
Please, video game. Stop with the break.

187
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:09,920
Hmm? I'm alive? I made it? How?

188
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:13,920
No, what?

189
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:22,240
We need to protect Emma. Real and true. Okay.

190
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:26,880
I don't know what would be most easier.

191
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:32,160
I think mouse and keyboard seem easier today. I think we'll do a little chipping.

192
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:42,320
I can hear.

193
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:46,880
Does that need to turn up the game volume?

194
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:55,120
Huh, curious. Curious. Hold on. Oh wait, I forgot. I got a VQB asset.

195
00:22:57,360 --> 00:23:04,480
Um, I got a VQB asset. Hold on. Wait, wait, wait. I got an asset. Hold on. I need to get it on screen.

196
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:10,880
I'm trying to be better at using fucking VQB assets, okay? I just accept.

197
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:16,720
The site can't be reached. Right, don't look. That's embarrassing. Don't look.

198
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:22,160
Stop. I'm messing it up. Stop. I'm messing up. Don't look. Don't look. Hold on. Hold on.

199
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:26,400
Cut the camera. I'm too dumb for this. Cut the camera.

200
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:32,880
Wait, no. Don't look. This is embarrassing. Stop. I'm a real VQBer, okay? I'm a real VQBer.

201
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:38,800
Right. Well, clearly the fucking line is going down. Right. Hold on. No. Wait, hold on. Wait,

202
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:44,400
how'd that rotate it? Stop. Oh, there we go. There we go. Eee-hee-hee. Right, and I'm a little bit bigger.

203
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:51,520
I don't know like that. Oh no, it's on my hair. No, not my hair. My arms.

204
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:56,960
Hold on. That's a little... I don't know. Is that Scott? I said,

205
00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:04,480
is this more Scott than I thought? I think it is. Hold on. Right. Okay, this is totally going to work.

206
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:16,480
That'll have to do. It'll have to do.

207
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:24,480
Eee-hee-hee.

208
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:32,480
Sorry, Zura's helping me with her don't-a-thon. Right. Okay. Game.

209
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:41,040
Okay. That looks, that looks all right if I don't, if I don't go too high up with my elbow,

210
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:46,480
it looks fine. Okay. Eee-hee-hee. It's fine if I don't go too high up. Right. Okay.

211
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:52,400
Tell me if I need to up the game sound. I think I do by a couple of decibels. Right,

212
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:58,960
I've upped it a little bit. Um, okay. Zoom game, let's go. Right, what is this?

213
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:07,760
Fallen, fallen is Babylon. High the mic and lower the game a bit. Can you up your mic?

214
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:14,640
Are you trolling? Because I'm so loud normally. Okay, lots of people, very vintage, very coral,

215
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:20,560
reef. Oh wait, hold on. Do we have subtitles on? I need subtitles people. Audio options. Get those

216
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:28,480
subtitles on. Close enough. Graphic options. Get those subtitles on. Close enough. Customer,

217
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:36,720
no, not the controls. Gameplay. Dialogue subtitles are already on. No, that did not say I was playing

218
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:42,480
easy mode by the way. Get your facts right. I'm off to work. Have fun. See ya. That's what she

219
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:49,200
injects into the reef lens when they think they're dunning. Oh, oh, hello. Hi. Do you need a daddy?

220
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:52,000
No, okay. Oh, and me.

221
00:25:54,880 --> 00:26:01,040
What does that do? Addonis luxury resort. Okay, I have a melee.

222
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:06,800
As fuel. Okay, we need to reserve our fuel.

223
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:17,840
Dude. Hold on. Hold on, scuff. I know. Wait, why no, not load. Options. Controls.

224
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:27,600
Why would CB crouch? Go and do the favor. Customize controls. And they're at most

225
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:34,240
use eight force control. No, customize the T. What? Oh, for fuck's sake, I'm actually gonna have to

226
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:38,880
do C to crouch. This is gonna go terrible. This is gonna go terrible.

227
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:51,280
Who the fuck are you? Because you weren't a big daddy. You're too acrobatic for that.

228
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:58,800
Addonis bats. Oh my god, it's already gonna, I'm getting freaked out. I'm sorry. I'm already getting

229
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:07,280
scared of this game. Okay. F to pick up. Why would it be F? Bro, I may have to do mouse and

230
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:14,320
peeve. I'm not even kidding. Hold on. I think I'm gonna be a cheeky sod and do mouse and peeve work.

231
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:23,280
Why is why jump? Oh my goodness. Right. Sorry, we're doing a, we're doing my game.

232
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:28,400
Bad thing. Warning. High voltage room generator. Well, that shit's barking.

233
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:37,600
Am I going against my first fight? I'm actually getting quite creeped out by this game

234
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:46,080
because why not you're done for. I just creeped in there. I don't like it. Press and hold.

235
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:51,440
Oh, why is it giving me prompts for the hook off?

236
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:58,880
Okay. Oh, for fuck's sake. It's giving me keyboard prompts. Why?

237
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:06,800
Stop giving me keyboard, friend. Gameplay. Customize. Use a flow system to control it.

238
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:09,680
Yeah. So then give me prompts for the controller.

239
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:14,080
What's this? It says I can scavenge something.

240
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:19,760
Beans. The first thing I get in this game is beans. First aid kit and some dollar

241
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:26,000
readers. Why not? Oh, that's right. The system in this game, you need money to buy ammunition.

242
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:31,840
Lam is watching. Well, I hate her already, so I can't wait to perish her by the end of this game.

243
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:33,680
I got drill fuel.

244
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:40,800
I got PTSD, the fuck?

245
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:48,480
Having me joined back. What are you? Take plasma. Okay, so big,

246
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:53,120
big daddy can have drill and abilities.

247
00:28:57,920 --> 00:28:58,320
Okay.

248
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:06,960
Oh.

249
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,960
I think I've just got these most of the time.

250
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:16,960
Oh.

251
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:22,960
Wait, why is my main to Nadadi that appears?

252
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:36,640
What? What is that? Why is it so fast? What's an eaves dispenser? Harder than Harvan.

253
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:47,920
I hate when there's two ways to go because I don't know which way is the safe way to look

254
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,840
and then like eat anyone. Enemy's in your...

255
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:53,840
Is that me doing those steps?

256
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:58,400
Am I so big? I'm like stomping.

257
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:04,000
Right. I need to go where she went. Sorry. Sorry. I need to go follow the...

258
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:07,280
I'll get it. I'll get it. I'll get it. Right. Okay. We need to zap the door awake.

259
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:10,560
Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Give me... Let me get up. Let me get up.

260
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:15,200
Lord of lords. I'm so written there.

261
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:18,480
Shocking enemy with lead trigger then quickly attack for critical damage.

262
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:28,240
Unfortunately, I don't have much mana. I don't want to be too wasteful right now.

263
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:31,280
I'm at a scavenger real quick.

264
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:38,640
Oh, I'm to shock that panel. Oh, you mean that super highlighted panel? Yeah, I need to shock it.

265
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:42,240
Okay. Health gain from bandages. Okay.

266
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:46,560
Now what? We going swimming?

267
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:51,520
The lamb is watching. Well, not for long when she's dead in a minute.

268
00:30:57,920 --> 00:30:59,520
Oh my god, it's AC on the comms.

269
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:02,640
I mean, it is Tannenbaum. I know who you are.

270
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:05,360
Tannenbaum. Isn't that a song from Christmas?

271
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:10,160
Find me in the Atlantic Express train station.

272
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:20,960
Oh my god. We're doing it. And there's an arrow to tell me where to go because I'm too dumb.

273
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:27,280
Press back space to get... Oh, wait. Daddies don't fight each other.

274
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:33,040
Daddies fight... Daddies help the rapture be patched up.

275
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:35,760
Thank you. Good work, daddy.

276
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:42,160
Yes. Okay. Right. Daddies fix the rapture up. Okay. I got it. I got it.

277
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:46,960
Bonk. Bonk.

278
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:55,760
This is Dr. Sophia Lam with a message for the people. Remember, you are not alone.

279
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:56,800
I don't like you, Lam.

280
00:31:56,800 --> 00:32:01,520
Think of me not as a leader, but as a mother to the rapture family.

281
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:05,040
The rapture family.

282
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:07,680
Hmm.

283
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:18,080
I don't like this. I don't like it. I don't believe her. Her lat. What?

284
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:21,200
Oh, it's a Gatlin.

285
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:26,000
What are you doing?

286
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:35,280
Heathen! Who are you calling a Dirty Heathen? I'm getting called a Heathen. I'm getting bullied.

287
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:43,920
Oh, shit. Is the chat broken? Sorry. I just realized this guy's broken because I'm not sure what to do.

288
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:50,880
All right. There we go. What is it? Kitty bar.

289
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:57,040
Hold X to reload your weapons. Stay away. Away from whom, eh?

290
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:00,880
What's this? A rivet gun?

291
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:08,880
Collected fresh water. Who is banging a boot? It's me that's banging them.

292
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:18,800
Okay. She calls herself mummy. She's an imposter. She has to perish. Literally. Freakin.

293
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:23,040
She thinks she's. Oh, hi, darling. Are you okay?

294
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:28,240
Or is that creepy acrobat going to yank you again?

295
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:30,800
Hi, darling.

296
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:38,800
Big sister.

297
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:43,920
Monkey.

298
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:49,840
Oh, I know my first battle.

299
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:56,240
I don't know what to do. I'm fucking suffering.

300
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:03,840
I, wait, hold on. I'm reloading. This isn't, I don't want to do my first boss battle already.

301
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:12,480
Are you a servant of the lamb together? You, you're going to perish. Sorry, but you're, it's over. Press right button for a fucking drill.

302
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:21,920
Okay. Drill time. Okay. That's doing nothing. And I'm almost dead. You're out of Eve. Find a hypno.

303
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:28,880
Why are you leaving? Why are you running? I wasn't finished with you yet. Is the boss battle still going on?

304
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:32,880
Use the first aid kit.

305
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:36,880
Okay. All right, fuck off.

306
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:50,880
Hmm. Yeah, simply in legendary mode. That's why I almost got rolled and smoked right in the first battle.

307
00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:56,160
The first actual boss battle. And I like literally I'm only said.

308
00:34:56,480 --> 00:35:01,760
Okay. I left on the D pad to heal up. That's fine.

309
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:08,720
No, go away. You suck. We will be reborn in the cold womb of the ocean.

310
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:15,280
When the, uh, this looks like a boss fight to me.

311
00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:21,040
I'm scared. No, hold on. I'm scared.

312
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:27,600
Oh, well, good thing I can breathe under war. Right.

313
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:34,880
Warm womb of mummy. You should watch my ears.

314
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:42,080
Okay. Yeah, I was going to say, I'm pretty sure I can breathe under water. So I'm not sure

315
00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:44,480
how this was like some sort of finishing move. Like

316
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:59,040
death of many great men. You will not last long. You can still reach the train station. Find me there.

317
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:09,040
Hmm.

318
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:23,760
Everyone's being mean to me. Yo, yo, how curious, curious, curious, curious. We must kill the fake

319
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:33,280
mother. Oh, I'll fucking take that. If that's that electricity. Thank you.

320
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:43,760
Swimming in the reef. Does the cold womb make a good cooler? I can refrigerate.

321
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:45,760
Yeah, put you in the refrigerator.

322
00:36:51,360 --> 00:37:01,280
Wow. What an opening. Welcome to the rapture. Your beautiful city. Oh, it's me.

323
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:06,320
I guess we go down.

324
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:14,320
Well, I hope we go down anyway. So yeah, it's our job to like fix the pipes and stuff.

325
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:20,000
It's literally you through for us. See you big sister.

326
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:23,920
I said we're not getting a big sister for Jane too, because of you now.

327
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:28,640
You've ruined it. You've ruined it. Airlock.

328
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:34,160
Well, it's fine. It's so bubbly in here.

329
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:48,000
Oh, this is so different to the previous ambience.

330
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:54,000
Just a lot of cheeky.

331
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:02,880
Come upstairs to the ticket booth, and I will offer what I know of you.

332
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:12,320
Why aren't you playing on the Xbox? Oh, there's a sale on for all the bio shocks for $15. So I got

333
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:20,720
that one because you guys are saying that bio shock infinite is good as well. So I think we're

334
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:26,160
going to play that together, too. Atlantic Express Maintenance Facility.

335
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:29,840
Safety now. Please use your safety gear.

336
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:47,040
Now most to survive are like this. Spicers. Spicers are drug addicts, vicious animals.

337
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:58,000
Yes. Got a respawn. I need to save at the Vita chambers or pick up the hack to oh no,

338
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,400
no, no, no, no, no, no.

339
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:12,160
Oh, no. Is this a logic puzzle? To hack a machine, press a to stop the needle in a green section.

340
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:12,800
Is it easy?

341
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:19,120
Okay, it's fine. At least it's not logic based.

342
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:25,840
Okay, it's not logic based. I'll take it right right bumper.

343
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:28,480
Take out the gun. Right. Okay.

344
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:34,400
That's so bad. It's so bad. Bumblebee?

345
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:44,640
Bumblebee?

346
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:55,200
We got Bumblebee in this game? Hi, Bumblebee. We will be reborn. No yinx. I got Bumblebee on

347
00:39:55,200 --> 00:40:05,440
my side. Sweet little Bumblebee. I know what you want from me. See, I'm not scared anymore,

348
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:11,520
you know? I'm not scared because I have health. The end of Ryan is the end of the cell.

349
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:18,000
I think I'm gonna have to melee the crap out of these.

350
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:24,080
Piece of lamb. I don't like you.

351
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:32,000
Uh, they have a flashlight.

352
00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:41,040
Am I a tyrant? Be honest. Am I the tyrant? Where's my Bumblebee?

353
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:52,800
Dead man. Ten years subject, Delta. Since I watched you put a gun to your head and pull the trigger.

354
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:59,120
Wait, I came. I really is? I think I came back. Out of your pain, paradise was born.

355
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:07,520
I don't know how you survived. Neither do I. Your suffering is over now. These men will ease your

356
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:17,760
burden. Please understand. Oh, I'm a game just crashed. Sorry, my game just fucking crashed.

357
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:28,480
This is why I didn't play the new version because apparently this game crashes if you play the

358
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:34,080
remastered version a lot. Well, I hope I didn't lose too much progress. Hold on, let me make sure

359
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:38,400
it shows up on screen. Run there's an admin. I think I might have to.

360
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:43,840
I was like, oh, it started a little bit and then it just three of crashed. Okay, right, you can see it.

361
00:41:45,120 --> 00:41:46,240
Okay, continue.

362
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:56,080
This is such a cute, I love the difference with the ambience of the loading screen.

363
00:41:58,480 --> 00:42:01,200
Okay, okay. We didn't lose it for anything.

364
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:07,200
Imagine if I put you right back at the start. Average Bioshock screen. Oh.

365
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:17,920
Oh, oh no. Have I corrupted my file already? I'm going to open it and lower like all the

366
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:25,520
graphics and stuff. This wasn't part of the script. This wasn't part of the script.

367
00:42:26,080 --> 00:42:31,840
Um, graphics quality low, I guess is what we're just going to do for now,

368
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:35,840
because I don't know why it's crashing.

369
00:42:35,840 --> 00:42:36,640
Okay.

370
00:42:56,160 --> 00:43:01,680
I don't, I doubt it's a graphic issue, but if putting it lower means it's going to not, oh my god,

371
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:07,440
the low graphics is terrible. I'm so sorry. I don't know why it's pressing, but

372
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:12,640
if it means we can play the game, right? Oh, wait, no, where's bumblebee?

373
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:18,800
Sugar. I've already forgotten. Is bumblebee ahead? I think bumblebee's ahead.

374
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:26,000
Okay, right. He closes the door. Yep. And then I grab this. Yep. Yep.

375
00:43:31,680 --> 00:43:38,080
Monk. Monk. Monk. Sorry. The game's prompted me.

376
00:43:40,240 --> 00:43:45,360
Oh, the game hates me. Be honest. Use. Oh, no, that's not right.

377
00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:52,480
Brace yourself. Yeah. Use the controller please. Prompt me via the controller. That'd be great.

378
00:43:53,440 --> 00:43:57,760
And then write bumper up for the drill. Oh, no, the Gatlin. Let's use the Gatlin.

379
00:43:58,320 --> 00:44:04,640
Bumblebee. Okay, back again. Hit him with a back bend. Are you squidding me right now?

380
00:44:06,080 --> 00:44:09,520
Just pretend your helmet is dirty and you can't clean it. What does that mean?

381
00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:16,880
I got a bonus out of that. I don't really know why. Thank you, Lord of Storms, for the extended

382
00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:22,800
medium not easy. I'm impressed. Wait, the game put itself on medium? I better not have.

383
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:26,800
Are you kidding me right now? Okay.

384
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:35,600
Time flies like an arrow and fruit flies like banana. Have a good day.

385
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:46,480
What? Thank you, Blessashimi. What? Time flies like an arrow and fruit flies like a banana?

386
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:52,800
Like a fruit fly on a banana? Because fruit flies are on fruit?

387
00:44:55,280 --> 00:45:02,640
I don't get it. I'm too dumb. I'm too dumb. Okay, we don't have to do anything here. Just go straight

388
00:45:02,640 --> 00:45:10,160
into this. Oh, wait, no, I did get attacked. Right, bravo. I got attacked. I don't know from where.

389
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:12,160
Where do you come from?

390
00:45:15,840 --> 00:45:19,920
I feel like my my blunt attack should be enough to like absolutely annihilate them.

391
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:21,360
I'm just going to scavenge whatever.

392
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:34,960
God, the little graphics quality is pretty rough. I have to admit this is rough.

393
00:45:35,840 --> 00:45:36,640
Oopsie.

394
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:41,280
Right, come on, Bumblebee. We've got people to kill.

395
00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:48,960
Okay, right. Let's pray this doesn't break because if it breaks, I think we're in trouble.

396
00:45:51,120 --> 00:45:54,000
Fruit flies like a banana.

397
00:45:57,280 --> 00:45:59,200
You don't want to listen to that? Oh, they're not playing?

398
00:45:59,200 --> 00:46:06,560
You. That symbol on your hand blocks you a dead man. Ten years subject, Delta.

399
00:46:07,280 --> 00:46:14,720
Since I watched you put a gun to your head. I'm subject, Delta. But take heart out of your

400
00:46:14,720 --> 00:46:22,960
pain. Paradise was born. I don't know how you survived, but your suffering is over now.

401
00:46:23,840 --> 00:46:26,160
These men will ease your burden.

402
00:46:27,440 --> 00:46:33,360
Please understand that like all I have done for you in D is an act of love.

403
00:46:37,760 --> 00:46:40,240
It's a Sophia lamb. She has found you.

404
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:44,880
I can't do anything, Christopher.

405
00:46:45,600 --> 00:46:58,400
Oh, I'm fire. I can't get out. Fuck. Jump bitch. Get out. What?

406
00:47:05,920 --> 00:47:09,360
Out. Where am I going? Out. Help, help, help, help, help.

407
00:47:10,320 --> 00:47:13,440
Search corpses for loot. I don't even see a corpse.

408
00:47:17,120 --> 00:47:18,880
That's slam dunk, honestly.

409
00:47:22,560 --> 00:47:24,480
This game looks like strong. No.

410
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:33,280
Now you know if the enemy we share, Sophia lamb, the camera in your helmet allows me to

411
00:47:33,360 --> 00:47:36,800
watch through your eyes and help you to fight her.

412
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:43,520
Okay, hold on. Right. We're going to risk it. We're going to risk it. I'm going to put the

413
00:47:43,520 --> 00:47:49,040
graphics back up because this is pretty painful. We're risking it.

414
00:47:51,520 --> 00:47:58,640
We're risking it. Okay, that's much better. My PC might be screaming right now. Atlantic

415
00:47:58,720 --> 00:48:03,040
Express administrative storage. Okay.

416
00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:09,680
I'm applying with fire. Right. I don't need to activate the save station.

417
00:48:19,840 --> 00:48:24,080
I don't see them. I'm just picking up my beans.

418
00:48:24,080 --> 00:48:27,520
Where are the security cameras?

419
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:44,560
Oh, this?

420
00:48:45,120 --> 00:48:50,640
Okay. Come on, Bumblebee. Show me what you got.

421
00:48:52,640 --> 00:48:54,160
What's this? Bot shut down.

422
00:48:56,960 --> 00:49:02,080
What? Like all bots? I don't know if it's worth hacking. Sorry. This must be...

423
00:49:02,080 --> 00:49:07,360
I'm so sorry if you've freaking played this game before. I'm so bad. I don't know what to do.

424
00:49:08,320 --> 00:49:08,800
Oh.

425
00:49:13,440 --> 00:49:15,520
Oh, she's grown up because it's been 10 years.

426
00:49:21,680 --> 00:49:23,280
There's a camera's catch on this thing, but...

427
00:49:29,600 --> 00:49:32,560
I'm trying. Where are you running away from?

428
00:49:32,640 --> 00:49:37,040
Telekinesis. Pick up big stuff with your mind. Throw out your enemies. What else do you need to know?

429
00:49:39,760 --> 00:49:41,040
Oh, I remember these.

430
00:49:41,040 --> 00:49:46,400
Throw objects at foes. You can even catch grenades and throw them back.

431
00:49:47,840 --> 00:49:54,000
Evolved today. I remember the commit. Hold left trigger to grab objects and...

432
00:49:55,280 --> 00:49:58,960
Okay. Something tells me I need to throw some stuff back.

433
00:50:03,440 --> 00:50:10,560
Bunk. Okay. That was a good practice run. Let's go. Press X to reload the weapon.

434
00:50:10,560 --> 00:50:17,440
I'm reloading. I'm reloading. She knows the way. She is the fake queen. She does not know doing.

435
00:50:22,800 --> 00:50:26,160
Bumblebee, do you want to do the honors or do I have to actually fight?

436
00:50:27,120 --> 00:50:33,840
Bumblebee, don't kid in the way, darling. I'll end up killing you because I'm a dumbass.

437
00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:42,480
I'm getting obliterated. Sorry. How do I fucking take off telekinesis?

438
00:50:43,360 --> 00:50:46,080
Get that shite off. Get electrical on right now.

439
00:50:50,480 --> 00:50:53,440
I'm getting fucking... Wait, is this for easy mode?

440
00:50:54,400 --> 00:50:59,040
Am I going mental or am I just really... And I'm out of fucking...

441
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,160
You guys didn't tell me this game was hard.

442
00:51:07,760 --> 00:51:12,320
Right, I'm to loot bodies apparently. I don't know what for. Come here, what for?

443
00:51:14,080 --> 00:51:16,400
I've just looted bodies.

444
00:51:16,400 --> 00:51:23,120
Okay, I'm just looting. I'm looting everything.

445
00:51:24,320 --> 00:51:29,440
Wait, I just did a 360. Get near me and you did a free shaky.

446
00:51:30,560 --> 00:51:34,320
Sorry, but this game is not hard. No, I just suck.

447
00:51:36,320 --> 00:51:38,800
Punishment for sucking. You need to send me an audio view.

448
00:51:41,440 --> 00:51:45,680
Oh my god, the kitchen's on fire. See, this wouldn't have happened if that was the one that was cooking, okay?

449
00:51:46,720 --> 00:51:52,000
So I'm guessing all the beans that I'm picking up will add to one health kit at some point or something,

450
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:55,840
or maybe it just heals me a wee bit. Right, hold to listen.

451
00:51:57,360 --> 00:52:04,160
White is not black, Dr. Lam. Down is not up, and straw is not gold.

452
00:52:05,280 --> 00:52:07,280
Look around you. Skeletons.

453
00:52:07,280 --> 00:52:11,600
Rapture is no miracle. It is a product of reason.

454
00:52:12,560 --> 00:52:18,800
Impossible in less one and one or two, and A equates to A's.

455
00:52:23,440 --> 00:52:33,360
And yet, alone, each man is a prisoner to bias. Dream, delusion, or the pain of a phantom limb to one man.

456
00:52:33,920 --> 00:52:35,920
They are as real as rain.

457
00:52:36,880 --> 00:52:41,520
Reality is consensus, and the people are losing faith.

458
00:52:42,240 --> 00:52:49,520
Take a walk, Andrew. It is raining in Rapture, and you have simply chosen not to notice.

459
00:52:58,080 --> 00:53:01,200
Sophia Lam is using the splicers against you.

460
00:53:02,160 --> 00:53:09,520
Most big daddies are like her slaves, guarding the little ones, but someone has awakened you.

461
00:53:14,160 --> 00:53:16,160
What the fuck was that noise? Jesus.

462
00:53:16,720 --> 00:53:19,760
All right, left bumper. Telekinesis.

463
00:53:23,680 --> 00:53:25,680
Yeah, Ellie Bumblebee buzzing in my ear.

464
00:53:25,680 --> 00:53:35,280
I know of your bond with Eleanor Delta. To save yourself, you will come for her.

465
00:53:36,080 --> 00:53:38,080
But Eleanor has a...

466
00:53:38,720 --> 00:53:40,720
Sorry, I just bought something by accident.

467
00:53:40,720 --> 00:53:43,280
One you cannot share. There is no place...

468
00:53:44,800 --> 00:53:52,560
An evil, a rivet. The rivets bolt together steel plates for the construction repair rapture.

469
00:53:53,280 --> 00:53:55,840
I need to... I need to fix stuff to progress.

470
00:53:57,200 --> 00:53:58,240
Butt shot down.

471
00:54:03,200 --> 00:54:05,920
I don't know who or what I'm shutting down, but I shut down buttons.

472
00:54:07,280 --> 00:54:09,520
You can hack the machine to lure its prey through.

473
00:54:14,080 --> 00:54:16,880
That hummin', I thought that was my PC getting ready to take off.

474
00:54:16,880 --> 00:54:20,320
What? I'm patching the hole. Fatchy, patchy hole.

475
00:54:23,120 --> 00:54:27,520
In ethical psychiatry, we must account for the role of evolution.

476
00:54:28,240 --> 00:54:35,520
Uh-huh. Depression fits a panic. Sexual pathos. All responses to ancient selection pressure.

477
00:54:36,320 --> 00:54:38,960
Hold on a minute, this alarm goes. She's kind of preaching a little bit.

478
00:54:38,960 --> 00:54:44,320
This theory is why Ryan's people invited me here. They mistake my stuff.

479
00:54:44,320 --> 00:54:46,880
Peace off, ghosts. For the worship of competition.

480
00:54:46,880 --> 00:54:49,040
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Acrobat somewhere else.

481
00:54:49,680 --> 00:54:52,880
One must know the beast before it can be raided.

482
00:54:55,920 --> 00:54:57,280
Something's tingling.

483
00:54:57,840 --> 00:54:59,920
Quickly, head for the elevator.

484
00:55:01,760 --> 00:55:05,600
Uh, it's over. It was nice playing the game while it lasted.

485
00:55:07,840 --> 00:55:08,480
Shut up!

486
00:55:13,280 --> 00:55:14,720
Stop, you're panicking me!

487
00:55:14,880 --> 00:55:18,960
That missed.

488
00:55:22,160 --> 00:55:22,880
Shut up!

489
00:55:28,080 --> 00:55:31,280
What is shooting me? Stop it! You're not Bumblebee.

490
00:55:34,720 --> 00:55:38,320
Oh my god, I'm so bad at the combat. I'm pretending otherwise.

491
00:55:41,680 --> 00:55:43,840
Can I just get one of you guys to play this game?

492
00:55:45,680 --> 00:55:46,180
Okay.

493
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:58,000
She didn't notice? What was that to notice?

494
00:56:00,240 --> 00:56:02,720
You will learn how to play hacking into the membrane now.

495
00:56:05,040 --> 00:56:08,080
The combat in this game is always chaotic. You're doing great.

496
00:56:15,520 --> 00:56:17,040
Eleanor.

497
00:56:26,560 --> 00:56:27,040
Okay.

498
00:56:32,800 --> 00:56:35,040
Oh. Oops.

499
00:56:37,920 --> 00:56:39,040
He stole someone's?

500
00:56:45,520 --> 00:56:52,000
Send me my gamer energy. I'm gonna need it. I'm absolutely just gosh awful right now.

501
00:56:52,880 --> 00:56:54,640
But we start vomiting instead.

502
00:56:55,360 --> 00:56:59,200
Hi. Would you like to fight? No? Are you sure?

503
00:57:01,040 --> 00:57:04,080
Oh, the game is teaching us that there's no freaking

504
00:57:05,200 --> 00:57:07,920
la bombas. Okay, so I don't need to do anything.

505
00:57:08,480 --> 00:57:08,800
Bomb?

506
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:10,880
Well, that's a waste.

507
00:57:11,200 --> 00:57:14,880
Uh, you got special ammo, press.

508
00:57:16,240 --> 00:57:20,160
Fuck it! Up, down, left, right, B, B, elemental, P on the keyboard.

509
00:57:24,080 --> 00:57:24,580
What?

510
00:57:29,920 --> 00:57:30,560
Is there's no one?

511
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:36,080
Oh, I can just straight up pick them up off the ground.

512
00:57:36,080 --> 00:57:39,520
Oh, okay. Well, don't mind about the Jesus. What the heck was that even about?

513
00:57:41,840 --> 00:57:46,720
I'm scavenging. I'm scavenging. Oh, I need a whole day.

514
00:57:52,320 --> 00:57:53,520
You little Alexander.

515
00:58:00,320 --> 00:58:02,000
When the game gives you a first aid kit.

516
00:58:10,880 --> 00:58:14,880
Or who wanders off unless a wolf is tearing at his flock.

517
00:58:14,880 --> 00:58:20,960
When no aggressor is present, he regards his little sister as he might a common houseplant.

518
00:58:20,960 --> 00:58:26,480
Do we need something more? Something stronger and unbreakable physiological bond.

519
00:58:31,920 --> 00:58:33,280
Why aren't they one show?

520
00:58:34,640 --> 00:58:35,600
Should be one show.

521
00:58:37,120 --> 00:58:38,800
Oh, why is there so much food in the bin?

522
00:58:41,440 --> 00:58:44,160
Uh, the chats are very cool.

523
00:58:47,440 --> 00:58:50,320
Hello. Oh, hello, turning bomb.

524
00:59:11,680 --> 00:59:12,560
Are you sitting here right now?

525
00:59:14,080 --> 00:59:16,640
We function pretty much like the big daddies.

526
00:59:16,640 --> 00:59:19,680
Without Strolly, we start to lose our minds.

527
00:59:19,680 --> 00:59:20,800
Real and true. Thank you.

528
00:59:24,640 --> 00:59:28,400
Oh, wait. I have a mark of a beast on the hand. It's a triangle. Relax.

529
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:33,680
Although that's in the babel, if you don't know.

530
00:59:34,640 --> 00:59:37,440
They're like, oh, the mark of the beast is either on the forehead or the hand.

531
00:59:41,840 --> 00:59:47,840
Hold back splasters. Oh, no, not a boss fight. Please. I suck so bad.

532
00:59:47,840 --> 00:59:51,040
Use trap rivets. I don't know where.

533
00:59:53,600 --> 00:59:55,760
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to do that.

534
00:59:56,560 --> 00:59:57,440
He's off ghost.

535
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:06,880
I'm just putting traps everywhere. I don't have a fucking clue.

536
01:00:07,120 --> 01:00:14,880
I'm trying. I don't know what to do. I'm just putting them down.

537
01:00:24,720 --> 01:00:31,440
I don't know like the combat in this game. I suck. Please drop rivets. I'm begging.

538
01:00:37,840 --> 01:00:42,720
I don't. I don't have any goal complete. Oh, thank God. Don't make me do that again. I'm scared.

539
01:00:44,240 --> 01:00:48,160
Thank you. Now I must leave you. And I am sorry for this.

540
01:00:48,800 --> 01:00:53,280
But there are others I must help before the city derounds.

541
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:57,600
This Manson Claire, he is an ally and will guide you to Illinois.

542
01:00:57,600 --> 01:01:00,000
This game is aged. It's probably me. Let's be honest.

543
01:01:01,520 --> 01:01:02,240
And good luck.

544
01:01:03,920 --> 01:01:05,680
Oh, my name is Delta.

545
01:01:06,880 --> 01:01:11,600
Look at you. A bona fide night in Alma, complete with iron horse.

546
01:01:11,600 --> 01:01:14,400
Sinclair friendly. The name is Augustus Sinclair sport.

547
01:01:14,400 --> 01:01:16,080
I guess the Sinclair style.

548
01:01:16,080 --> 01:01:20,320
Old Tannenbaum and I share an interest in the old Fontaine building.

549
01:01:20,320 --> 01:01:23,440
The very same place you'll find Elinor Lamb.

550
01:01:24,400 --> 01:01:30,240
I think you and I can do business. Take the train to Ryan amusements. I'll see you shortly.

551
01:01:31,200 --> 01:01:34,960
I'll see you shortly. From Augustus Sinclair.

552
01:01:35,680 --> 01:01:42,080
But I do declare my name is Johnny Cutters is a fantastic opportunity to play your game.

553
01:01:42,080 --> 01:01:48,000
I am honored to be able to explore this game for the first time.

554
01:01:49,040 --> 01:01:51,760
I know the gameplay is absolutely terrible.

555
01:01:51,760 --> 01:01:54,800
That's not going to stop me from enjoying it nonetheless.

556
01:01:55,760 --> 01:02:04,000
I love the fucking the difference in ambience when you're in the menu loading.

557
01:02:11,120 --> 01:02:12,560
Oh, we should watch Die Hard.

558
01:02:15,680 --> 01:02:18,720
Well, I appear to have arrived at my destination.

559
01:02:19,280 --> 01:02:22,800
As you can see, Chief, the station is iced over.

560
01:02:22,800 --> 01:02:27,840
To reach Elinor Lamb at Fontaine headquarters, we'll have to clear the way.

561
01:02:27,840 --> 01:02:33,360
Now, in order to melt that ice, you'll need a plasmid like a handful of hellfire.

562
01:02:34,080 --> 01:02:39,680
We used to sell a fine old product called Incinerate in the amusement park up yonder.

563
01:02:39,680 --> 01:02:40,560
Oh, you mean?

564
01:02:40,560 --> 01:02:44,160
Find a way in. I've already been on all the rides.

565
01:02:44,480 --> 01:02:51,600
Well, when you you tells me, sir, matter of fact, sir, when you tells me that I was only

566
01:02:51,600 --> 01:02:57,200
got one way to go through the amusement park, who am I to say no to this fabulous opportunity?

567
01:02:57,200 --> 01:02:59,840
I do appreciate it, sir. I really do.

568
01:03:00,560 --> 01:03:03,200
We are but the stones to pave the way.

569
01:03:03,200 --> 01:03:04,160
Now that's terrible.

570
01:03:07,520 --> 01:03:13,440
The fucking rotation on a the controller is probably the worst part about playing controller.

571
01:03:14,640 --> 01:03:16,800
Now, I say she is our salvation.

572
01:03:16,800 --> 01:03:19,200
Now, that is a modified declaration.

573
01:03:19,200 --> 01:03:23,680
I'm not sure you want to confirm nor deny.

574
01:03:25,600 --> 01:03:27,120
Is that my footsteps?

575
01:03:27,120 --> 01:03:31,280
I swear to God, if I'm fighting another daddy, I've had enough of fighting dad in one game.

576
01:03:31,280 --> 01:03:32,080
I can tell you that much.

577
01:03:37,280 --> 01:03:42,320
Is it just yourself, sir, in this fine bell dome arena area?

578
01:03:42,320 --> 01:03:43,680
Is there something to scavenge?

579
01:03:45,280 --> 01:03:47,440
Oh, this is a shoe shaining thing.

580
01:03:47,440 --> 01:03:49,760
Like you go on the shoes.

581
01:03:50,800 --> 01:03:53,040
Oh, I do declare this game is modified.

582
01:03:53,040 --> 01:03:58,880
I must say the ambience, however, for someone of my skittish nature is rather

583
01:03:58,880 --> 01:04:02,400
more defined, terrifying, even on legendary mode.

584
01:04:02,960 --> 01:04:05,120
Alpha series, I believe.

585
01:04:05,760 --> 01:04:09,520
Now, rapture's full of scientific wonderments just like you.

586
01:04:09,520 --> 01:04:12,560
And if we can sell them to the world at my price,

587
01:04:12,560 --> 01:04:14,480
we'll cure in your condition.

588
01:04:15,920 --> 01:04:16,880
Now, hold on a minute.

589
01:04:16,880 --> 01:04:18,080
I cannot do it.

590
01:04:18,080 --> 01:04:18,640
Hold on.

591
01:04:18,640 --> 01:04:19,120
Hold on.

592
01:04:19,920 --> 01:04:20,960
Damage increase?

593
01:04:22,640 --> 01:04:23,840
Very squinty arena.

594
01:04:25,520 --> 01:04:28,480
Do the rest of the stream using my accent idea?

595
01:04:28,480 --> 01:04:30,160
What are you talking about accent?

596
01:04:30,160 --> 01:04:31,600
I spawned in like this.

597
01:04:31,600 --> 01:04:33,680
I am from the south.

598
01:04:34,560 --> 01:04:37,120
I have what the fuck I had.

599
01:04:37,120 --> 01:04:39,520
I literally sound like this for real, for real.

600
01:04:39,520 --> 01:04:47,600
Thank you, the booty lord for your kind generosity for your, your accompaniments

601
01:04:47,600 --> 01:04:50,880
of your monetary pardon with your monetary values.

602
01:04:51,440 --> 01:04:53,280
This is my real voice.

603
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:57,680
And I'm not doing a terrible job at this accent at all.

604
01:04:58,400 --> 01:04:58,880
Truly.

605
01:04:58,880 --> 01:05:01,840
I was hired to engineer a park the likes of which no man has seen.

606
01:05:02,720 --> 01:05:05,360
Now all I do is watch over it like a grizzled sheep dog.

607
01:05:06,240 --> 01:05:09,760
My first line of mechanical puppets made the children here cool with wonder.

608
01:05:10,560 --> 01:05:14,320
But Ryan thought my vision was immature, antiquated, he said.

609
01:05:15,200 --> 01:05:19,600
This place could have been something magical, but instead he turned it into a school.

610
01:05:19,600 --> 01:05:22,640
No, a cathedral dedicated to himself.

611
01:05:24,800 --> 01:05:26,720
Yeah, I can't believe he dedicated.

612
01:05:28,880 --> 01:05:30,880
Yeah, I didn't care.

613
01:05:34,880 --> 01:05:36,240
And now what?

614
01:05:40,880 --> 01:05:44,080
Now I do not have no fights with no other daddies.

615
01:05:44,080 --> 01:05:44,480
Okay.

616
01:05:44,480 --> 01:05:45,680
I'll make that very clear.

617
01:05:45,680 --> 01:05:46,400
I got a ticket.

618
01:05:46,400 --> 01:05:48,240
I got a golden ticket.

619
01:05:48,240 --> 01:05:49,440
Jam dandy.

620
01:05:49,440 --> 01:05:51,120
That'll get you in the park.

621
01:05:51,120 --> 01:05:54,400
But buying incinerates gonna cost Adam.

622
01:05:54,400 --> 01:05:57,280
It's a sort of genetic goo that lets you rewrite.

623
01:05:57,360 --> 01:05:58,160
Genetic.

624
01:05:58,160 --> 01:06:00,560
I also have genetic goo in my marshmallow.

625
01:06:10,400 --> 01:06:11,680
Well, yes, of course.

626
01:06:11,680 --> 01:06:15,360
I know exactly where the El Dorado lounge is.

627
01:06:15,360 --> 01:06:17,440
It's rather mighty.

628
01:06:17,440 --> 01:06:22,160
Oh, I love searching me some file in cabinets for four dollars.

629
01:06:22,160 --> 01:06:24,880
Yes, I'm in the security way.

630
01:06:28,080 --> 01:06:31,440
Now there's no need to be so afraid.

631
01:06:34,640 --> 01:06:35,440
What is this?

632
01:06:37,920 --> 01:06:41,520
I appear to have myself something of a 50 caliber round.

633
01:06:41,520 --> 01:06:44,080
Now don't mind if I do old sport.

634
01:06:44,080 --> 01:06:45,520
Now this is getting exciting.

635
01:06:48,640 --> 01:06:53,120
Now that wasn't very bona fide of me to do that against y'all.

636
01:06:53,120 --> 01:06:56,320
But you have to forgive me for I'm rather entertained.

637
01:06:58,240 --> 01:06:59,520
Oh my god.

638
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:03,920
I do apologize.

639
01:07:03,920 --> 01:07:07,680
That wasn't very bona fide, but I still enjoyed it nonetheless.

640
01:07:07,680 --> 01:07:08,640
That ain't gonna stop me.

641
01:07:08,640 --> 01:07:10,720
OK, I'm gonna insert my ticket right here,

642
01:07:10,720 --> 01:07:13,200
just like I insert my ticket into yours.

643
01:07:15,680 --> 01:07:16,320
Oh, we got it.

644
01:07:18,480 --> 01:07:19,760
You have picked up your...

645
01:07:19,760 --> 01:07:22,640
You have picked up your mighty first gin tonic.

646
01:07:22,640 --> 01:07:26,640
Tonics are passive abilities that have a variety of helpful effects.

647
01:07:26,720 --> 01:07:30,960
Unlike Plasmid, you never had to activate tonics.

648
01:07:30,960 --> 01:07:34,160
They take effect as soon as you quit them.

649
01:07:34,160 --> 01:07:35,440
What the fuck?

650
01:07:35,440 --> 01:07:37,200
In today's dangerous times,

651
01:07:37,200 --> 01:07:40,480
it never hurts to be a little faster on your feet.

652
01:07:40,480 --> 01:07:43,760
Remember, you don't have to outrun the crazed glasses,

653
01:07:43,760 --> 01:07:44,640
just your neighbor.

654
01:07:45,440 --> 01:07:48,400
I guess just shove it in there because I don't know what that means.

655
01:07:51,360 --> 01:07:53,280
Now do get to admire the little...

656
01:07:53,280 --> 01:07:54,480
Oh, go on then.

657
01:07:56,640 --> 01:07:58,640
Cruising the Atlantic in his steamboat.

658
01:08:02,080 --> 01:08:04,880
OK, he had a thought about starting up Rapture

659
01:08:04,880 --> 01:08:05,840
and becoming a god.

660
01:08:05,840 --> 01:08:06,800
I think we're aware.

661
01:08:08,480 --> 01:08:10,320
Wait, what's the name of Prince...

662
01:08:10,320 --> 01:08:12,560
Oh, Prince Naveen!

663
01:08:12,560 --> 01:08:13,200
OK, there we go.

664
01:08:14,240 --> 01:08:16,000
I believe I have nailed the X.

665
01:08:27,600 --> 01:08:29,440
Hold on now, hold on now.

666
01:08:30,240 --> 01:08:31,680
Oh, I'm out of ammunition.

667
01:08:31,680 --> 01:08:34,880
I beg your pardon, I'm out of ammunition.

668
01:08:34,880 --> 01:08:35,280
Stop it!

669
01:08:38,720 --> 01:08:39,440
Stop it!

670
01:08:41,840 --> 01:08:42,720
Stop it.

671
01:08:42,720 --> 01:08:45,200
Finally, a bio-shot shooting the St. Clairflint.

672
01:08:45,200 --> 01:08:45,600
Ow!

673
01:08:49,760 --> 01:08:52,560
Thank you, Vega, for your pan generosity.

674
01:08:57,040 --> 01:09:00,640
Get off of that man.

675
01:09:01,360 --> 01:09:02,800
Are these advertisements?

676
01:09:04,240 --> 01:09:05,040
Oh, these are!

677
01:09:10,880 --> 01:09:14,480
I believe these are advertisements for the products

678
01:09:14,480 --> 01:09:19,040
that I may have accessibility to at a later date.

679
01:09:19,040 --> 01:09:21,760
Pick your plasma and evolve.

680
01:09:21,760 --> 01:09:23,680
Now, if I had to pick a plasma,

681
01:09:23,680 --> 01:09:25,120
mine would be telekinesis,

682
01:09:26,080 --> 01:09:27,520
from the other side of the room.

683
01:09:27,520 --> 01:09:28,400
Whoa, who said that?

684
01:09:28,400 --> 01:09:30,320
That was inappropriate conduct.

685
01:09:30,320 --> 01:09:31,920
You can't be saying that kind of stuff.

686
01:09:31,920 --> 01:09:32,960
It's far too...

687
01:09:33,760 --> 01:09:36,400
Now, when I must declare,

688
01:09:36,400 --> 01:09:38,400
when I see a Vita chamber,

689
01:09:38,400 --> 01:09:40,960
it makes me nervous for the fight that's ahead of me.

690
01:09:55,120 --> 01:09:56,800
Possibly even lethal.

691
01:09:57,440 --> 01:10:00,960
The lab aids are starting to call them Big Daddies.

692
01:10:00,960 --> 01:10:01,440
Perhaps they're so cheap.

693
01:10:01,440 --> 01:10:02,480
Well, yes, that's me.

694
01:10:02,480 --> 01:10:03,280
I'm Big Daddy.

695
01:10:03,280 --> 01:10:06,160
Bonded pairs, connected by a lamp that kills.

696
01:10:07,200 --> 01:10:09,520
Why is your southern accent spot on?

697
01:10:09,520 --> 01:10:10,880
I have terrible news for you,

698
01:10:10,880 --> 01:10:14,320
but you are listening to my voice through rose-tinted glasses.

699
01:10:14,320 --> 01:10:16,560
You are my good sport.

700
01:10:16,560 --> 01:10:19,360
You are listening through rose-tinted glasses,

701
01:10:19,360 --> 01:10:22,240
because there's no way in heck this accent

702
01:10:22,240 --> 01:10:24,560
is anything close to what I would earth.

703
01:10:24,560 --> 01:10:27,360
I'm supposed to be enunciating words, my good boy.

704
01:10:28,160 --> 01:10:29,920
But I assure you, I'm just trying my best.

705
01:10:29,920 --> 01:10:32,240
Now, I believe I went the wrong way.

706
01:10:32,240 --> 01:10:34,080
So there's Journey to the Surface.

707
01:10:34,080 --> 01:10:35,680
There's Gift Shop.

708
01:10:35,680 --> 01:10:38,400
Now, that machine back there was asking for Adam,

709
01:10:38,400 --> 01:10:40,640
but I do not have any Adam,

710
01:10:40,640 --> 01:10:42,880
so I need to find a little sister.

711
01:10:43,840 --> 01:10:45,440
But I don't wish to hurt her.

712
01:10:45,440 --> 01:10:46,640
No, no, sorry.

713
01:10:46,640 --> 01:10:50,480
We do not hurt little sisters in this facility.

714
01:10:51,440 --> 01:10:56,320
We respect little sisters from around these parts.

715
01:10:56,320 --> 01:10:57,440
We do, we do.

716
01:10:57,440 --> 01:10:58,480
How much sugar?

717
01:10:58,480 --> 01:11:01,360
All the sugar you can, or some matter we use.

718
01:11:08,400 --> 01:11:10,960
I am a little lost,

719
01:11:10,960 --> 01:11:14,640
but I'm sure the heads-up display will come on shortly

720
01:11:14,640 --> 01:11:18,000
when I seem to appear to have vandalized.

721
01:11:18,960 --> 01:11:20,320
Ooh, no.

722
01:11:33,520 --> 01:11:34,960
Nobody's the white.

723
01:11:36,080 --> 01:11:36,960
Now, that's a shame.

724
01:11:36,960 --> 01:11:38,960
You got to be nice to your fellow men's,

725
01:11:38,960 --> 01:11:40,800
because when you do...

726
01:11:40,800 --> 01:11:43,360
I know the surface, Eleanor.

727
01:11:43,360 --> 01:11:45,600
I spent half a lifetime there,

728
01:11:45,600 --> 01:11:46,640
in service of the common good.

729
01:11:46,640 --> 01:11:48,000
It's spinning the wrong way.

730
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:50,480
That's not the way the water spins where I'm from.

731
01:11:55,520 --> 01:11:57,360
Well, what's wrong with that old man?

732
01:11:57,360 --> 01:12:01,360
I tell you, you don't have no appreciation for the stomach,

733
01:12:01,360 --> 01:12:03,440
and that's clear as day to me, lady.

734
01:12:04,640 --> 01:12:06,000
Andrew Ryan is correct.

735
01:12:06,800 --> 01:12:08,960
Rapture is deliverance.

736
01:12:09,920 --> 01:12:12,480
Who is flushing their toilet without me?

737
01:12:14,160 --> 01:12:15,200
I'm about to get attacked.

738
01:12:15,200 --> 01:12:15,680
I might be...

739
01:12:17,440 --> 01:12:19,600
I was kind of joking about getting attacked.

740
01:12:20,240 --> 01:12:23,040
Jeez, that was so unrefined of you, little lady.

741
01:12:23,040 --> 01:12:24,880
You're not supposed to sneak up on someone.

742
01:12:24,880 --> 01:12:26,880
Goddamn, where the fuck did you come from?

743
01:12:28,240 --> 01:12:30,400
Where the heck am I supposed to go?

744
01:12:30,400 --> 01:12:31,920
Now, I do apologize.

745
01:12:31,920 --> 01:12:33,600
This is my first playthrough,

746
01:12:33,600 --> 01:12:36,640
so I'm a little bit discombobulated.

747
01:12:37,440 --> 01:12:38,880
First thing in the morning.

748
01:12:38,880 --> 01:12:40,480
Ryan's amusement park.

749
01:12:40,480 --> 01:12:42,800
Okay, Souvenir's is where I am.

750
01:12:43,920 --> 01:12:45,840
Did we get into...

751
01:12:45,840 --> 01:12:48,000
Okay, we're just gonna go down the stairs.

752
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:50,160
That's my guess of where we're supposed to go.

753
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:53,760
Have you played Bioshock Infinite?

754
01:12:53,760 --> 01:12:57,440
I have yet to be able to play that game.

755
01:12:57,440 --> 01:12:58,720
I did purchase...

756
01:13:02,240 --> 01:13:05,280
Pardon me, I'm losing my words and my vocabulary.

757
01:13:05,280 --> 01:13:06,160
That wasn't very...

758
01:13:15,600 --> 01:13:18,160
Now, do declare Eleanor you're doing more than enough,

759
01:13:18,160 --> 01:13:20,000
helping Big Daddy get over to you.

760
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:21,680
But I have to admit, I suck.

761
01:13:21,680 --> 01:13:24,240
Okay, you gotta give me some more time, darling.

762
01:13:24,240 --> 01:13:25,680
You have to give me some more time.

763
01:13:25,680 --> 01:13:29,520
Prefer your combat, up close and personal, with drill power.

764
01:13:29,520 --> 01:13:31,680
Your drills do more attacks.

765
01:13:33,280 --> 01:13:34,160
What is this?

766
01:13:34,160 --> 01:13:35,440
Hold on, sorry, I was pressurizing.

767
01:13:52,240 --> 01:13:52,960
Oh, yow.

768
01:13:59,760 --> 01:14:00,400
I do...

769
01:14:01,280 --> 01:14:01,780
What?

770
01:14:04,640 --> 01:14:06,640
It makes them look just like us.

771
01:14:08,160 --> 01:14:10,320
A little bit of brainwashing.

772
01:14:10,320 --> 01:14:11,760
Nice and early, I see.

773
01:14:13,360 --> 01:14:14,640
Fumble, babe.

774
01:14:14,640 --> 01:14:18,960
Well, if I do declare, it's time to ask an old friend for some help.

775
01:14:22,960 --> 01:14:24,720
Okay, good sport.

776
01:14:24,720 --> 01:14:25,600
Now, where is...

777
01:14:26,960 --> 01:14:28,720
There is a little sister ahead.

778
01:14:28,720 --> 01:14:31,600
To get the atom, you must deal with her Big Daddy first.

779
01:14:31,600 --> 01:14:37,680
He will not attack until you do, but be prepared for a fact.

780
01:14:37,680 --> 01:14:39,440
Okay, I'm gonna go machine gun.

781
01:14:40,960 --> 01:14:43,120
I'm not liking where this is going.

782
01:14:43,120 --> 01:14:47,040
And I have to admit, I'll find myself rather scared in this moment.

783
01:14:47,040 --> 01:14:48,640
Now, I don't mean to be a scaredy kid.

784
01:14:50,480 --> 01:14:50,980
All right.

785
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:52,500
All right.

786
01:14:55,040 --> 01:14:55,540
Um...

787
01:14:56,260 --> 01:15:04,260
Now, I must admit, I don't want to scare the little sister, but...

788
01:15:07,460 --> 01:15:08,980
Oh, dear, oh dear.

789
01:15:08,980 --> 01:15:11,620
Okay, well, time to put my big boy pants on.

790
01:15:11,620 --> 01:15:12,180
Goddamn.

791
01:15:16,180 --> 01:15:17,460
I'm spraying.

792
01:15:18,740 --> 01:15:20,580
I'm sorry, it has to be done.

793
01:15:20,580 --> 01:15:22,020
I need to add a more than you do.

794
01:15:22,340 --> 01:15:27,380
I'm sorry to look away, little child.

795
01:15:27,380 --> 01:15:30,100
This is big, but no, leave Bumblebee alone.

796
01:15:30,100 --> 01:15:31,540
He's my problem to deal with.

797
01:15:31,540 --> 01:15:32,980
That belongs to me.

798
01:15:32,980 --> 01:15:33,860
No, Bumblebee.

799
01:15:36,820 --> 01:15:37,940
No, that's a hack tool.

800
01:15:37,940 --> 01:15:38,980
What the fuck are you thinking?

801
01:15:41,540 --> 01:15:43,460
Okay, I apologize.

802
01:15:45,780 --> 01:15:46,480
I'm sorry.

803
01:15:52,020 --> 01:15:55,300
Ah, okay, I guess you're coming with me.

804
01:15:55,300 --> 01:16:01,140
I'm telling the other girls that I have to mess, daddy.

805
01:16:01,140 --> 01:16:05,300
I didn't even adopt you yet.

806
01:16:05,300 --> 01:16:10,220
Alright, you just come along with me.

807
01:16:10,220 --> 01:16:11,220
We're in business.

808
01:16:11,220 --> 01:16:12,220
Yeah.

809
01:16:12,220 --> 01:16:18,260
There are corpses all over Rapture, and little dimples there can sniff out the atom on them.

810
01:16:18,260 --> 01:16:21,260
Find one.

811
01:16:22,220 --> 01:16:24,140
You have adopted a new little sister.

812
01:16:24,140 --> 01:16:27,380
Well, there's only one in her name, M-E-B-Z, okay?

813
01:16:27,380 --> 01:16:31,420
Press and hold X to ask her to lead you to an atom-filled corpse.

814
01:16:31,420 --> 01:16:34,180
Well, press and hold X.

815
01:16:34,180 --> 01:16:35,180
We're...

816
01:16:35,180 --> 01:16:37,620
Okay, thank you, darling.

817
01:16:37,620 --> 01:16:38,940
I'm gonna...

818
01:16:38,940 --> 01:16:40,900
I will let you lead the way.

819
01:16:40,900 --> 01:16:49,540
I will protect us to where we need to go.

820
01:16:49,540 --> 01:16:50,540
One second, darling.

821
01:16:51,540 --> 01:16:53,940
It's well.

822
01:16:53,940 --> 01:16:59,060
It is it, darling?

823
01:16:59,060 --> 01:17:00,060
I don't...

824
01:17:00,060 --> 01:17:01,060
I'm not really sure.

825
01:17:01,060 --> 01:17:02,580
I'm just following your lead, okay?

826
01:17:02,580 --> 01:17:03,580
You just do your thing.

827
01:17:03,580 --> 01:17:04,580
You...

828
01:17:04,580 --> 01:17:05,580
You sniff it out.

829
01:17:05,580 --> 01:17:06,580
Oh, there you go, darling.

830
01:17:06,580 --> 01:17:11,220
She's got a juicy one, but when she starts draining out the atom, the splashes will come

831
01:17:11,220 --> 01:17:12,220
running.

832
01:17:12,220 --> 01:17:14,620
Are you ready before you set her down on that body?

833
01:17:14,620 --> 01:17:17,820
It was too good to be true, okay?

834
01:17:17,820 --> 01:17:19,300
You go down there, darling.

835
01:17:19,300 --> 01:17:30,740
I will protect you, but just don't be afraid to use that needle.

836
01:17:30,740 --> 01:17:32,740
Set up traps, M-E-B-Z.

837
01:17:32,740 --> 01:17:33,740
Absolutely.

838
01:17:33,740 --> 01:17:34,740
M-E-B-Z.

839
01:17:34,740 --> 01:17:35,740
M-E-B-Z.

840
01:17:35,740 --> 01:17:36,740
M-E-B-Z.

841
01:17:36,740 --> 01:17:37,740
M-E-B-Z.

842
01:17:37,740 --> 01:17:38,740
M-E-B-Z.

843
01:17:38,740 --> 01:17:39,740
M-E-B-Z.

844
01:17:39,740 --> 01:17:40,740
M-E-B-Z.

845
01:17:40,740 --> 01:17:42,340
Your little sister?

846
01:17:49,260 --> 01:17:50,260
Oh.

847
01:17:51,060 --> 01:17:53,260
Oh, I don't like...

848
01:17:53,260 --> 01:17:55,740
Oh, pardon me, I was a little scared there.

849
01:17:55,740 --> 01:18:00,580
I do not like when the music suddenly...

850
01:18:00,580 --> 01:18:01,580
Stop it.

851
01:18:01,580 --> 01:18:03,580
I

852
01:18:09,380 --> 01:18:13,840

Please stop

856
01:18:20,100 --> 01:18:22,900
You're scaring me more than you're scaring the child

857
01:18:24,380 --> 01:18:26,380
I'm more scared than the child

858
01:18:26,740 --> 01:18:28,740
I

859
01:18:30,300 --> 01:18:32,300
Who is cutting

Stop it. I don't have distance. Who is cutting the door behind stop

861

862
01:18:46,660 --> 01:18:51,740
Are you please get back on my back my goodness that was terrifying don't do that again now

863
01:18:51,740 --> 01:18:57,500
You know the stakes son, but a plasmid costs a bit more Adam yet keep it up

864
01:18:59,340 --> 01:19:01,780
Darling you're gonna have to leave me to another corpse

865
01:19:01,780 --> 01:19:09,020
I mean another angel wink wink because I believe the little sisters see them as angels even though they're not

866
01:19:09,500 --> 01:19:14,620
I'm holding eggs. Sorry. I'm holding it. It's so hard to do the voices

867
01:19:14,940 --> 01:19:19,420
You are out of ease find I

868
01:19:20,860 --> 01:19:22,860
Well

869
01:19:23,020 --> 01:19:27,900

871
01:19:39,700 --> 01:19:41,700
Please

872
01:19:42,700 --> 01:19:45,180
Did they just keep coming I

873
01:19:51,780 --> 01:19:53,780
Don't really want to spend on

874
01:19:59,500 --> 01:20:05,300
What are you honking that machine for I mean in my apologies, I don't know what happened to my accent

875
01:20:05,300 --> 01:20:07,940
I've always been from the transatlantic areas

876
01:20:08,460 --> 01:20:10,820
I don't actually oh

01:20:12,700 --> 01:20:17,420
I don't like that now hold on now. I didn't sign up for this. I did not sign up for this

878
01:20:18,700 --> 01:20:20,980
Hold on time to annihilate them

879
01:20:21,980 --> 01:20:23,980
Stop it

880
01:20:24,100 --> 01:20:26,100
She's not helpless

881
01:20:27,460 --> 01:20:29,460
She's having help because of

882
01:20:32,220 --> 01:20:39,660
Now I don't personally smell it but as long as you're taking me there. I don't mind at all. Please stop coming so close to me

883
01:20:42,180 --> 01:20:45,660
As ammo supposed to be so scarce in this game

884
01:20:45,660 --> 01:20:50,820
Or am I just really dumb and I'm supposed to use my money on that because I feel like I'm being very different now

885
01:20:53,140 --> 01:20:57,860
I'm trying this looks like a scavenging area darling. I think there's something to scav

886
01:20:58,900 --> 01:21:02,780
Venge around here. Yeah, okay. This looks very scavenging. Yes

887
01:21:11,700 --> 01:21:16,820
I can't sleep myself. I guess it's just be with me. Mr. Voice recorder

888
01:21:30,100 --> 01:21:32,100
And your sleeping bag

889
01:21:32,100 --> 01:21:34,100
I

890
01:21:47,180 --> 01:21:52,580
Don't really need money for anything in this game, but consumables lie health and ammunition. All right

891
01:21:52,580 --> 01:21:56,380
I see I will definitely be purchasing a lot more

892
01:21:57,300 --> 01:21:59,300
booleates

893
01:22:00,180 --> 01:22:07,140
Because I'm certainly running out. I didn't realize I didn't why do you look so real fuck you

894
01:22:14,100 --> 01:22:16,100
Present air, okay

895
01:22:19,820 --> 01:22:21,980
Okay, I'm just stop it. I

896
01:22:23,420 --> 01:22:25,700
Don't have ammunition for this

897
01:22:26,660 --> 01:22:30,380
So I think I'm gonna have to swap back to my voice again a bit crazy trying to

898
01:22:31,140 --> 01:22:33,140
Figure out what I'm supposed to do

899
01:22:33,780 --> 01:22:35,780
Well, there's an oil slick

900
01:22:36,540 --> 01:22:38,020
slick

901
01:22:38,020 --> 01:22:40,020
Fuck you beach

902
01:22:42,740 --> 01:22:44,740

01:22:52,700 --> 01:22:54,700
Scalene

906
01:23:07,100 --> 01:23:10,780
If I don't need to hold on to money like that, I'm just buying some bullets

907
01:23:14,380 --> 01:23:16,380
Doggy in the wind

908
01:23:21,900 --> 01:23:28,060
Hold up in this workshop surrounded by those whale and brats trying to beat their way in they want my food my guns

They want it all

910

I'm gonna fix up the transport stuff that's been rusted in the main way pumpkin space. Be careful

912

Indeed, I care for you in equal measure to any other

914
01:23:43,580 --> 01:23:49,580
Sentient creature, but I cannot sacrifice a thousand of my children

915
01:23:50,060 --> 01:23:52,060
For one rebellious son

916
01:23:53,900 --> 01:23:58,060
Son wait, is that my grandson? Is that my morhen?

917
01:24:16,060 --> 01:24:18,060

A slicer is healed at health station hack them to turn them into traps

I'm not speaking to you. Yeah, I don't think anyone's fucking speaking to me

922
01:24:49,580 --> 01:24:51,580

There should be one of the air vents. They favor in the workshop bring her down there

I'm trying to scavenge, but I think I just look I thought you were a lie

931
01:26:03,100 --> 01:26:09,020
On the surface the scientist invests the power I like the animatronic look

932
01:26:11,020 --> 01:26:13,020
Praise the sun

933
01:26:16,380 --> 01:26:18,380

Constantly buying you stuff again

I mean, uh, apologize. I don't know what came over there

951
01:27:45,500 --> 01:27:50,860
Just enough adam for our purposes and the girls are likely try to repay you somehow

952
01:27:51,500 --> 01:27:55,980
But rapture's a high stakes town son and she is a jackpot

953
01:27:56,540 --> 01:27:58,940
You just have to be willing to take it all

954
01:27:59,580 --> 01:28:04,460
You're no more adam than the price of one plasmid. So the rest is graving

955
01:28:04,940 --> 01:28:10,300
No, down here. It's your survival or hers. I refuse

956
01:28:11,020 --> 01:28:15,020
I refuse sir. Do not dare hurt the little sister

957
01:28:15,340 --> 01:28:21,020
Bringing a little sister to a vent allows you to choose whether to rescue or harvest her

958
01:28:21,500 --> 01:28:26,620
If you harvest her you get maximum adam to spend on plasmid, but she will not survive

959
01:28:27,020 --> 01:28:29,980
If you rescue you get less but she'll be cured

960
01:28:31,180 --> 01:28:35,420
We will rescue my darling little sister. There you go. Goodbye, darling

961
01:28:35,580 --> 01:28:39,420
You go enjoy yourself being human or whatever the fuck. I don't know

962
01:28:40,300 --> 01:28:42,300
Ah

963
01:28:43,020 --> 01:28:45,020
Okay, they

964
01:28:45,020 --> 01:28:49,180
Oh, you feel better now. Well, our tin man had a heart all along

965
01:28:49,660 --> 01:28:53,660
Personally, I call that a liability, but you have a liability

966
01:28:55,260 --> 01:28:59,980
Head to the hall of the future and splice up. Oh, she's so cute. She can't get in

967
01:29:03,020 --> 01:29:08,140
What an adorable little sister. Okay, we will save all the little sisters

968
01:29:08,300 --> 01:29:14,140
I don't even know what adam is quite used for yet. So I don't even know if I made the right decision

969
01:29:14,460 --> 01:29:16,460
That was adorable. That was so sweet

970
01:29:17,580 --> 01:29:20,220
Okay, we have helped a little sister become human

971
01:29:21,100 --> 01:29:24,780
You just spawned in right in front of me. Don't think I didn't see your

972
01:29:25,500 --> 01:29:26,540
Your

973
01:29:26,540 --> 01:29:30,060
Unjustifiable weight. Why the fuck is my melee so bad?

974
01:29:30,700 --> 01:29:33,100
To be honest, I thought my melee would be a bit stronger

975
01:29:34,060 --> 01:29:37,660
You was our first aid kit, I just might

976
01:29:41,660 --> 01:29:48,060
I don't I don't even have enough munitions for this kind of combat. Please stop spawning in

977
01:29:50,140 --> 01:29:53,420
I don't seem to have much evil to my name either

978
01:29:53,740 --> 01:29:56,300
I might just have to artificially purchase

979
01:29:57,180 --> 01:29:59,020
Some extra

980
01:29:59,020 --> 01:30:01,500
Evil or manners. We also

981
01:30:02,140 --> 01:30:09,020
Described it as you made the right choice. Adam gets you more spells. Well, of course it does. It's all coming together now

982
01:30:16,540 --> 01:30:20,380
Why yes, of course my parents did what they could when they could

983
01:30:21,740 --> 01:30:23,740
These are hands everywhere

984
01:30:29,020 --> 01:30:31,020
More

985
01:30:32,380 --> 01:30:36,860
Do not go to war to die for the nation. The only thing you should be doing is

986
01:30:37,420 --> 01:30:39,420
It's inking and and having a good time

987
01:30:39,820 --> 01:30:42,460
Upgrade your weapon. Okay. What can I do?

988
01:30:43,660 --> 01:30:44,700
Um

989
01:30:44,700 --> 01:30:52,460
Damage increases to bow drill spin and the melee. I think I might be doing that because all I seem to do is

990
01:30:53,100 --> 01:30:55,660
Hickle them when I hit them with my drill

991
01:30:55,900 --> 01:31:01,580
Uh, unless there's some sort of meta in bow shock too. I am unaware of

992
01:31:02,460 --> 01:31:05,740
Why are you inking? Did I say something about inking? My apologies

993
01:31:06,700 --> 01:31:08,620
um

994
01:31:08,620 --> 01:31:10,620
the create the

995
01:31:11,020 --> 01:31:16,220
Content creator wants to post their creations online, but the parasites say no

996
01:31:17,340 --> 01:31:24,540
Uh, can can jump at people with the drill yet. No. Okay. I think we'll just do drill damage because

997
01:31:25,660 --> 01:31:32,700
Oh, it now has well, it had something on it. I don't know what the nature of that was but I saw it on the side of my screen

998
01:31:56,460 --> 01:32:01,420
He's saying this job won't change history change history

999
01:32:03,980 --> 01:32:05,980
Tomorrow's a mystery

1000
01:32:08,380 --> 01:32:13,180
No, I'm not here. I'm not here shut up. I'm not here

1001
01:32:14,220 --> 01:32:17,660
Don't tell them my location. That's cheesy doodling

1002
01:32:19,740 --> 01:32:21,740
What I do this

1003
01:32:22,540 --> 01:32:24,380
What do you

1004
01:32:24,380 --> 01:32:29,820
About shut down panels are used to cancel the alarms and shut down security bots that have been summoned by the alarm

1005
01:32:29,820 --> 01:32:36,940
Using the bot panel is free alarms can also be cancelled by successfully hacking. Okay. Well, that's good enough for me

1006
01:32:37,900 --> 01:32:39,900
Uh, how do I?

1007
01:32:40,620 --> 01:32:42,860
No, don't hack just break it

1008
01:32:44,780 --> 01:32:51,100
No, okay, there we go. Wait, I can search that what is it? Did you say search on that?

1009
01:32:52,620 --> 01:32:59,820
I'm right. My rivets are full. Are you joking? My rivets are full. I can't do any more

1010
01:33:00,860 --> 01:33:02,860
This way I'm going. Oh

1011
01:33:04,620 --> 01:33:10,540
I got it. I mean, I did obtain the evil that I so desperately needed. I'm just

1012
01:33:11,980 --> 01:33:13,980
What is this a new diary entry?

1013
01:33:14,940 --> 01:33:18,060
I know this facility is vital for the preservation

1014
01:33:18,940 --> 01:33:21,980
I see a cut scene. Oh, god. This one

1015
01:33:32,620 --> 01:33:34,620
I spoke to a young man

1016
01:33:37,500 --> 01:33:39,500
Asking you

1017
01:33:39,500 --> 01:33:41,500
I

1018
01:33:51,020 --> 01:33:53,180
Why is it vermin take two miniature?

1019
01:33:56,540 --> 01:34:02,780
Wait, what do you mean? I do declare. I'm afraid y'all come fuzzling me young man. What do you mean vermin tied to?

1020
01:34:03,660 --> 01:34:09,340
Although we will be doing vermin tied to again. I thoroughly I thoroughly enjoyed myself

1021
01:34:09,900 --> 01:34:11,900
Playing that with you

1022
01:34:12,540 --> 01:34:18,940
You would drain the people of their life's blood. Oh, I'd drain them. All right. That's my day job. Thank you very much, ma'am

1023
01:34:19,020 --> 01:34:21,020
That's my day job. I drain all the people

1024
01:34:21,580 --> 01:34:23,580
And big sister is the hand

1025
01:34:24,700 --> 01:34:26,700
When thumbnail so vermin tape

1026
01:34:27,180 --> 01:34:32,300
It says only this. Oh, my apologies. I guess it's broken. I will fix it after stream

1027
01:34:33,020 --> 01:34:40,860
YouTube has unfortunately updated most things so it broke the chat. It broke the redirects

1028
01:34:40,940 --> 01:34:47,420
It is also broken thumbnails apparently because uh, not only myself, but my darling

1029
01:34:48,140 --> 01:34:51,020
Sheebie also has found herself

1030
01:34:51,580 --> 01:34:52,860
um

1031
01:34:52,860 --> 01:34:55,820
Experiencing the thumbnail glitch

1032
01:35:02,700 --> 01:35:05,660
Uh, okay. We are going to

1033
01:35:06,220 --> 01:35:09,660
upgrade our incineration

1034
01:35:10,700 --> 01:35:18,140
Incineration when it absolutely positively has to erupt into flames. Don't wait incinerate. All right. I'm going to equip

1035
01:35:18,220 --> 01:35:24,780
Light up enemies to a thousand degrees warning fire spread

1036
01:35:28,140 --> 01:35:34,780
Fire spreads well, that's good. So now we can either upgrade our health or we can upgrade the eve link

1037
01:35:35,340 --> 01:35:40,540
First aid kits also give you eve. It's pretty big not gonna lie

1038
01:35:41,500 --> 01:35:47,100
Get more out of your first aid kits with eve link this revolutionary new gene tonic

1039
01:35:47,260 --> 01:35:52,940
Causes your body to produce eve whenever you use a first aid kit. I wouldn't mind that as a passive ability

1040
01:35:53,020 --> 01:35:55,020
I find that rather good

1041
01:35:56,460 --> 01:35:58,780
Popping gum more like popping

1042
01:35:59,900 --> 01:36:02,540
Ejaculate sorry, I apologize

1043
01:36:03,580 --> 01:36:05,580
What the

1044
01:36:11,420 --> 01:36:16,860
Eve her I have hardly even I do declare. I hardly know that lady. I do not know who she is

1045
01:36:17,580 --> 01:36:19,580
Oh, look at all the water

1046
01:36:20,300 --> 01:36:22,300
Oh me oh my

1047
01:36:27,980 --> 01:36:30,300
Many changes will be flowing

1048
01:36:31,580 --> 01:36:37,980
Oh, so this is how I obtain more uh, the hacking needle needs moves slightly slower

1049
01:36:38,460 --> 01:36:44,620
Extra new you gain a little more health back from snacking on things increase your maximum eve

1050
01:36:45,260 --> 01:36:48,860
Does sound rather bodacious at this time

1051
01:36:50,300 --> 01:36:53,660
I've taken it. So now we have no adam, but that's okay

1052
01:36:55,660 --> 01:37:00,140
I assume if we need to progress and uh, who are you pissing on?

1053
01:37:01,740 --> 01:37:03,740
Oh, am I supposed to

1054
01:37:04,700 --> 01:37:12,620
All right now to uh, I believe we backtrack all the way back to a location

1055
01:37:19,340 --> 01:37:25,260
We will progress with our courage men we will steal ourselves to continue forth

1056
01:37:26,140 --> 01:37:31,260
On our journey not at all scared of what is up ahead because what the fuck was that?

1057
01:37:32,220 --> 01:37:37,660
Uh, I do not know what we are about to go up against but the music is terrifying me

1058
01:37:39,820 --> 01:37:41,820
I do not know what is ahead, but um

1059
01:37:57,820 --> 01:37:59,820
Peace off ghost

1060
01:38:01,260 --> 01:38:03,260
I

1061
01:38:22,460 --> 01:38:27,660
I'm guessing this is an unnatural fate and she runs away again little piss it bitch

1062
01:38:31,420 --> 01:38:33,420
I

1063
01:38:34,940 --> 01:38:41,820
See this is why I have a little sister and you don't you suck please die

1064
01:38:50,860 --> 01:38:55,340
Holy mosa son not even a big sister can keep you down

1065
01:38:56,300 --> 01:39:03,100
Well, no, I hope not come on back and melt the icing we can say goodbye to this two-bit corny ride

1066
01:39:04,620 --> 01:39:06,620
Okay

1067
01:39:15,900 --> 01:39:18,140
You cook literally well, thank you

1068
01:39:25,340 --> 01:39:29,260
Because parents deserve a night off to enjoy new years, but I met my wit and

1069
01:39:30,380 --> 01:39:32,380
I told you

1070
01:39:33,820 --> 01:39:35,820
All right

1071
01:39:36,220 --> 01:39:43,740
Well, uh blow that up just so we can uh scavenge these much needed supplies

1072
01:39:44,780 --> 01:39:46,220
He's gone

1073
01:39:46,220 --> 01:39:48,220
James was the only man I ever loved

1074
01:39:49,340 --> 01:39:51,580
Now it's like he never even came to rapture

1075
01:39:52,540 --> 01:39:54,540
He heard me sing at the limbo room

1076
01:39:54,860 --> 01:40:00,860
Came up all bashful. He liked hearing songs about what it's really like to live in this town

1077
01:40:03,420 --> 01:40:09,180
Eleanor is progressing brilliantly my physical participation in her birth was

1078
01:40:09,820 --> 01:40:15,260
Minimized of course it is vital that I am unhindered by nature's crude bias

1079
01:40:16,460 --> 01:40:20,300
I will be above all her intellectual progenitor

1080
01:40:21,020 --> 01:40:24,460
Loyal not to her but to the people she will ultimately

1081
01:40:24,780 --> 01:40:26,780
save

1082
01:40:28,940 --> 01:40:30,940
Outstanding sport

1083
01:40:30,940 --> 01:40:32,940
We're hoping to be quite a windfall

1084
01:40:33,100 --> 01:40:38,140
Now just open the train tunnel from the security booth there and I'll be able to come on

1085
01:40:39,660 --> 01:40:45,580
How could I be so silly as to not ascertain the knowledge that I had to open up the booth

1086
01:40:46,860 --> 01:40:48,540
How silly

1087
01:40:48,540 --> 01:40:51,340
I bloody locked myself inside. What the fuck have I done?

1088
01:40:51,340 --> 01:40:57,260
You can hack the shops if you do the price of items are reduced and you sometimes get free items

1089
01:41:03,660 --> 01:41:08,700
Wait get back here Sinclair. What the fuck you you backstabbing two time in

1090
01:41:10,140 --> 01:41:12,940
I had thought you some golem of Sinclair's

1091
01:41:13,580 --> 01:41:18,780
Brought here to go looms. This ain't lord of the rings through her pocket, but no

1092
01:41:19,740 --> 01:41:22,380
You are aware of your plight

1093
01:41:23,820 --> 01:41:30,700
I wonder would be so cruel to force a mirror on a man with no face. What?

1094
01:41:33,420 --> 01:41:36,540
Lamb was waiting for us come out shooting and start the train

1095
01:41:37,260 --> 01:41:40,460
How can I start the train? I don't know what I'm to do

1096
01:41:41,820 --> 01:41:46,300
Get on the train. I'm coming Sinclair. What the fuck warning you're about to leave this level

1097
01:41:46,300 --> 01:41:49,580
Make sure you done everything you want to do. Yeah, I don't care. Give me the fuck out of here

1098
01:41:52,460 --> 01:41:56,300
Well, I'm on the train and we're gonna make it. I think we're gonna make it

1099
01:41:58,300 --> 01:42:01,020
Yeah, yeah, yeah spank spank someone else

1100
01:42:02,300 --> 01:42:04,300
Golem not golem

1101
01:42:04,620 --> 01:42:06,620
test your baby

1102
01:42:07,340 --> 01:42:12,460
Ascertain that's a big word for mommy. It is I have to admit I had to ascertain that

1103
01:42:13,420 --> 01:42:16,220
Half philosophy that we are too dumb to understand

1104
01:42:18,060 --> 01:42:22,620
This is rather oh, okay. Well, you're not a big daddy with the

1105
01:42:28,140 --> 01:42:33,340
Why is it the first thing I'm asked to do is fight something big I just come to a new level

1106
01:42:37,580 --> 01:42:39,580
I'm stuck

1107
01:42:39,580 --> 01:42:41,580
Oh

1108
01:42:41,820 --> 01:42:48,940
Am I safe and he's the animulator, you know, they're doing the classic and showing you the balls trying to box us in kid

1109
01:42:49,260 --> 01:42:51,740
This is a goddamn city wide lockdown

1110
01:42:52,460 --> 01:42:58,540
To keep the train moving you need the security override key from the local governor grace halloween

1111
01:42:59,020 --> 01:43:05,420
She kicked me out of my own hotel down here. The Sinclair deluxe find her and get that key

1112
01:43:07,100 --> 01:43:09,100
The Sinclair deluxe

1113
01:43:10,540 --> 01:43:14,220
All right, well if you insist

1114
01:43:15,420 --> 01:43:17,420
Hack, okay, right bumper

1115
01:43:18,620 --> 01:43:26,060
Door control. Oh, I can just press x. Well, I didn't have to take this out when I do apologize for how dumb I am

1116
01:43:27,980 --> 01:43:33,500
Red result of successful have the security door now open. Okay, but let me just take out my gun

1117
01:43:33,500 --> 01:43:35,500
Oh

1118
01:43:36,700 --> 01:43:42,060
Anti personnel rounds 50 caliber. I don't really know the difference

1119
01:43:42,940 --> 01:43:47,340
But the game has given me more ammunitions which makes me

1120
01:43:48,780 --> 01:43:52,060
Rather hesitant for what comes next

1121
01:43:53,100 --> 01:43:55,100
And it is also giving me

1122
01:43:56,220 --> 01:44:01,340
Okay, I believe we have a fight my game or senses are tingling

1123
01:44:02,220 --> 01:44:04,620
And not the good kind to tinker, you know the

1124
01:44:08,300 --> 01:44:10,300
What are you doing?

1125
01:44:15,100 --> 01:44:19,260
I didn't really want to interrupt you weren't attacking me so I just

1126
01:44:20,460 --> 01:44:26,940
I assumed he was all right to be honest. That was rather weird. What on earth were you were you praying for?

1127
01:44:27,900 --> 01:44:31,900
Give yourself unto her. No, I don't

1128
01:44:33,740 --> 01:44:37,260
What do you see ahead? I see

1129
01:44:39,340 --> 01:44:42,940
A lot of things what we're already halfway through the game that can't

1130
01:44:43,660 --> 01:44:46,620
Is this is that true or is the backtracking in this game?

1131
01:44:46,700 --> 01:44:51,020
Are we already halfway through the game when I looked up on them into webs?

1132
01:44:51,100 --> 01:44:57,500
It says this game was about 10 hours long whether or not that is true if you were to play on

1133
01:44:58,060 --> 01:45:07,020
Uh, normal difficulty or hard difficulty. There's no way we're already through the game that far. I'm afraid I don't quite believe it

1134
01:45:08,860 --> 01:45:15,820
She ahead and where's the rest of the body. Oh my was that uh gentleman decapitated. Can I

1135
01:45:21,980 --> 01:45:23,980
What is repug?

1136
01:45:26,940 --> 01:45:29,980
Now I definitely I don't

1137
01:45:39,980 --> 01:45:41,980
Me

1138
01:45:51,580 --> 01:45:53,580
Like

1139
01:45:59,100 --> 01:46:04,540
No, but I'm friendly I've changed my ways I was dead for 10 years, but I come back

1140
01:46:07,340 --> 01:46:11,740
Why are the music so creepy stop it? I hate when the music is creepy

1141
01:46:13,180 --> 01:46:18,540
I feel like they're coming behind me behind me behind my derriere. Okay. What the fuck? Okay

1142
01:46:21,020 --> 01:46:26,620
I don't know where or what the bots are, but I'm gonna snap them if I see him around the corner

1143
01:46:28,540 --> 01:46:30,540
You are not alone

1144
01:46:37,500 --> 01:46:39,500
I would give anything to my sport

1145
01:46:39,580 --> 01:46:41,020
I guess grace is home

1146
01:46:41,020 --> 01:46:47,020
But that big lug just dropped half my damn hotel in your way now to break through that mess

1147
01:46:47,340 --> 01:46:51,020
I expect you're gonna have to work out how he got so burly

1148
01:46:52,860 --> 01:46:54,380
Burly

1149
01:46:54,380 --> 01:46:57,580
Jean bang yourself a genetic research camera son

1150
01:46:57,980 --> 01:47:03,500
You can pick up any number of tricks from a splicer with one of those try the pawn shop downtown

1151
01:47:04,860 --> 01:47:09,020
The pawn shop. I'm afraid that's already my specialty

1152
01:47:09,820 --> 01:47:14,540
Welcome to the gene bank. The gene bank allows you to customize your current loader

1153
01:47:15,180 --> 01:47:18,940
Load out of plasmids and tonic. Okay, so I can

1154
01:47:20,140 --> 01:47:25,660
All right. Well, I'm already missing a slot and I don't actually have anything extra to place in so I do apologize

1155
01:47:27,260 --> 01:47:29,500
Not quite necessary for what

1156
01:47:31,100 --> 01:47:33,100
What I'm trying to achieve

1157
01:47:33,740 --> 01:47:38,940
Uh, will we try and hack one of these I've actually never attempted before

1158
01:47:40,460 --> 01:47:42,460
Oh piss what the

1159
01:47:43,260 --> 01:47:45,260
What the fuck was that?

1160
01:47:46,300 --> 01:47:50,940
Well, I got a first aid kit. So actually I'm not gonna complain. That was actually rather decent

1161
01:47:51,740 --> 01:47:53,740
Gameplay from myself. Yes

1162
01:47:54,380 --> 01:47:56,940
I got an aspirin for a headache if I have one

1163
01:47:58,860 --> 01:48:01,820
All papa's drops the worst neighborhood in rapture

1164
01:48:02,220 --> 01:48:04,940
She gave me a hell of an opportunity to raise up some uh

1165
01:48:05,500 --> 01:48:07,260
affordable housing

1166
01:48:07,260 --> 01:48:10,860
When Atlantic Express was constructing their luxury passenger line

1167
01:48:10,940 --> 01:48:15,820
Why is this place was hollowed out beneath as flypouses for the railway crew

1168
01:48:16,460 --> 01:48:24,220
Nobody was supposed to reside down here long term. But when you're broken this town, you're not exactly swimming in alternatives

1169
01:48:24,940 --> 01:48:28,860
I don't favor spending more than an hour or so down here at the time

1170
01:48:29,580 --> 01:48:33,020
There ain't a side of the tracks more wrong than under them

1171
01:48:35,100 --> 01:48:37,100
What

1172
01:48:37,420 --> 01:48:39,020
What is

1173
01:48:39,020 --> 01:48:44,060
There's a lot of noises going on in this vicinity and uh

1174
01:48:44,940 --> 01:48:47,820
I have to admit it's making me rather nervous

1175
01:48:49,660 --> 01:48:53,340
Okay friendly big daddy, that's fine. I don't need to do nothing when they're big daddy

1176
01:48:53,420 --> 01:48:58,860
The the campaign is not instigating that I need more at them at this point in time

1177
01:48:59,420 --> 01:49:02,700
So I do not have any motivations to

1178
01:49:09,020 --> 01:49:11,020
A what?

1179
01:49:16,460 --> 01:49:18,460
Did he say the p word

1180
01:49:22,140 --> 01:49:25,100
Did he say the p word I think he actually said the p word

1181
01:49:26,060 --> 01:49:40,780
He did in fact ask you if you were calling him a p word. Yeah, you know, let's

1182
01:49:42,860 --> 01:49:44,860
Whoa

1183
01:49:46,140 --> 01:49:48,140
What is his thing at me

1184
01:49:49,100 --> 01:49:54,780
Well, there's the pawn shop, but it's bolted up tight. You'll have to find another way inside I expect

1185
01:49:55,660 --> 01:49:57,660
Oh

1186
01:50:00,620 --> 01:50:02,620
Oh, do you guys not have that insult in America?

1187
01:50:03,420 --> 01:50:07,820
What do they expect to keep enough drug stash in this clinic to slice up a rhinoceros?

1188
01:50:08,060 --> 01:50:10,860
Of course every poor soul in the drops gonna start beating down your door

1189
01:50:11,100 --> 01:50:15,500
It's my job to think up a new key code to keep them out. It seems like every other day now

1190
01:50:16,540 --> 01:50:19,740
Nuts, I'm all over for a while at the fishbowl tiner

1191
01:50:20,700 --> 01:50:22,700
Is there a number on the fishbowl?

1192
01:50:23,660 --> 01:50:29,500
All papa's drops the worst neighborhood in rapture, but it's a hell of an opportunity to raise

1193
01:50:30,060 --> 01:50:36,220
We use the f word instead refling when Atlantic Express was constructing their luxury passenger line

1194
01:50:36,620 --> 01:50:41,020
This place was hollowed out beneath as flowerpouses for the railway crew

1195
01:50:41,660 --> 01:50:49,500
Nobody was supposed to reside down here long term, but when you're broke in this town, you're not exactly swimming in alternatives

1196
01:50:50,220 --> 01:50:54,140
I don't favor spending more than an hour or so down here at a time

1197
01:50:54,860 --> 01:50:58,300
There ain't a side of the tracks more wrong than under them

1198
01:51:02,700 --> 01:51:04,700
All right

1199
01:51:05,900 --> 01:51:10,700
Now there is a daddy here, but I'm not interested in instigating anything without daddy

1200
01:51:12,140 --> 01:51:17,100
I don't need to add them daddy's happy with this daughter. I'm just gonna leave him be

1201
01:51:18,060 --> 01:51:20,540
Search containers

1202
01:51:25,340 --> 01:51:30,940
Something shining I hear it. What are you shining? Oh, I got a shot. I don't mind if I do

1203
01:51:32,300 --> 01:51:36,940
The clinic code is zero zero four seven. Well, you

1204
01:51:40,540 --> 01:51:45,740
Well, don't mind if I knew me mustang and sally

1205
01:51:47,340 --> 01:51:54,940
Even though mustang and sally is actually uh, two handed pistol. Okay, please stop. Please stop. You're scaring me

1206
01:51:56,780 --> 01:51:59,260
I don't have a bumblebee to my

1207
01:52:03,260 --> 01:52:06,540
Ow, something's getting me stop it. I can't see this

1208
01:52:08,700 --> 01:52:10,700
Who or what is this?

1209
01:52:12,540 --> 01:52:14,540
Telekinesis

1210
01:52:15,420 --> 01:52:17,420
All right, I'll

1211
01:52:19,900 --> 01:52:25,260
Okay, I'll let you two just do your thing over there. I can hear the daddy does the daddy fight

1212
01:52:27,980 --> 01:52:29,980
I'm not grabbing no child

1213
01:52:31,260 --> 01:52:36,700
Go much closer with the shotgun think of it as a melee weapon when starting to get some order of fresh kind of sounds more

1214
01:52:36,700 --> 01:52:39,260
Indian. Oh, I ain't trying to make fun of nothing

1215
01:52:40,220 --> 01:52:51,180
I'm literally just doing uh the transatlantic accent, but it's an absolute off. Okay. Uh, the number was zero zero four seven zero zero four

1216
01:52:52,220 --> 01:52:55,500
Seven man. I'm just so good. He's got the wrong idea

1217
01:52:55,900 --> 01:53:04,380
You're not responsible for turning elinor into a little sister. No, I'm not just slaves and you only recently broke free

1218
01:53:05,100 --> 01:53:09,740
I am I supposed to rescue the system put her through here

1219
01:53:18,460 --> 01:53:24,060
Uh, I actually starting to think I'm supposed to save that little sister back there and free her

1220
01:53:26,060 --> 01:53:32,540
Oh dear. All right. All right. All right, southern bell strong. It sounds good to me. You want a roleplay like this?

1221
01:53:33,020 --> 01:53:36,540
Oh, sweet pea. You needing some help to relax

1222
01:53:37,180 --> 01:53:43,340
Why don't I play with your hair sugar? You just rest your head on my lap and I look after you real nice

1223
01:53:45,340 --> 01:53:48,140
It's okay if you're tired and need to go to sleep

1224
01:53:49,340 --> 01:53:51,820
You did have an awfully long day today

1225
01:53:52,620 --> 01:53:54,620
Now we're gonna try and find

1226
01:53:55,740 --> 01:54:01,740
Uh, the little sister because we're gonna save her from the daddy that was back here if I'm not mistaken

1227
01:54:01,900 --> 01:54:03,900
I'm a little turned around but

1228
01:54:04,540 --> 01:54:08,060
Uh, I do hear. Oh, yeah, they're a piece of beef

1229
01:54:09,740 --> 01:54:11,740
No stop

1230
01:54:14,780 --> 01:54:17,740
All right, we are gonna

1231
01:54:18,940 --> 01:54:21,500
Okay, they seem to keep respawning here

1232
01:54:21,500 --> 01:54:28,060
So we are gonna have to be rather rather speed things up rather fast. Oh, and I'm already out of ammo

1233
01:54:28,060 --> 01:54:30,060
I'm

1234
01:54:30,700 --> 01:54:32,700
Working on it. I'm working on it

1235
01:54:33,420 --> 01:54:36,380
Little sister you're gonna have to get out of here. You're not gonna like what happens next

1236
01:54:40,540 --> 01:54:42,540
Uh, all right. All right. All right, stop it

1237
01:54:46,060 --> 01:54:48,060
Hold on I'm reloading hold on

1238
01:54:50,220 --> 01:54:53,020
Oh dear, okay, there we go. Where are you darling?

1239
01:54:53,020 --> 01:54:58,620
I need to get you in this motherfucking tunnel like right now adopt please and then go through that motherfucking tunnel

1240
01:54:58,620 --> 01:55:02,540
That is behind you because they are respawning behind us. I have no time. Fuck it search

1241
01:55:07,420 --> 01:55:13,900
Wait, oh no, I have to fucking continue to search Jesus our pop is so yeah, good luck

1242
01:55:18,060 --> 01:55:21,740
I'm gonna regret this so much, but I'm gonna shove her in the tunnel next in a minute

1243
01:55:23,020 --> 01:55:26,060
The monster has taken a number of our babies for his own

1244
01:55:26,700 --> 01:55:32,620
Tin daddy is hollow like a jail cell that needs filling and the world will never suffer

1245
01:55:37,180 --> 01:55:38,300
You know

1246
01:55:38,300 --> 01:55:44,460
You are not good pappermail. I'm afraid I got it all out of my system if you did not hear yesterday's audio

1247
01:55:45,340 --> 01:55:51,180
I did not expect to say what I said at the end of the audio. I was rather non-verbal due to the uh

1248
01:55:51,740 --> 01:55:59,020
Mentality that I was in during uh that recording session if you would like to call it that

1249
01:56:02,940 --> 01:56:05,420
But I did enjoy myself thoroughly

1250
01:56:06,380 --> 01:56:08,380
Uh

1251
01:56:15,420 --> 01:56:23,900
I'm putting you in the god damn tunnel. I'm afraid I'm out of evil. So I may lay only

1252
01:56:26,460 --> 01:56:29,260
That's okay. You're allowed to hit me as long as you're not hitting her

1253
01:56:29,660 --> 01:56:35,820
Go check out the audio later. It was for fucking minutes long. I can't last long

1254
01:56:37,100 --> 01:56:40,860
I will read it up. Hmm. Oh you finished

1255
01:56:41,580 --> 01:56:43,580
All right, and you go darling

Yes, yes, yes. Okay now

What you're gonna do is you're gonna climb in this tunnel and become human again. Okay

Okay, in you go

01:57:19,740 --> 01:57:23,500
We can't go gotta make sure she's safe. We can't go just yet. We have to make sure

1265

We will rescavenge for these uh trap rivets

1268
01:57:39,100 --> 01:57:41,100
Because it seems to

1269
01:57:46,140 --> 01:57:50,620
Oh, there's some evil up there. Okay, we don't actually need it right now

1270
01:57:50,620 --> 01:57:52,620
Come on

1271
01:57:56,060 --> 01:58:02,460
You what you called me a moop. How dare you sir? I do not take kindly to such accusations of being a moop

1272
01:58:09,260 --> 01:58:11,260
Yeah

1273
01:58:12,380 --> 01:58:14,380
You could have collected more atom

1274
01:58:17,100 --> 01:58:19,100
Is there too

1275
01:58:21,580 --> 01:58:23,580
To

1276
01:58:28,140 --> 01:58:32,460
I assume every little sister can do two bodies

1277
01:58:34,300 --> 01:58:37,420
If that is my judgment, this is to be active

1278
01:58:44,380 --> 01:58:46,380
Did that see

1279
01:58:47,260 --> 01:58:51,980
Oh, I'm out of ammunition's how embarrassed you

1280
01:58:55,180 --> 01:58:57,180
Hi, I'm like every time

1281
01:59:02,060 --> 01:59:04,060
Choo choo

1282
01:59:04,540 --> 01:59:07,660
This is the end of the line

1283
01:59:11,340 --> 01:59:13,340
Monk

1284
01:59:17,260 --> 01:59:21,340
Oh the turrets main, uh, I definitely need to purchase more

1285
01:59:22,940 --> 01:59:24,940
shortly because uh

1286
01:59:25,420 --> 01:59:27,580
I'm a hella. Wait, why are you shooting?

1287
01:59:34,620 --> 01:59:36,620
Can my own to dale hurt me

1288
01:59:37,580 --> 01:59:41,820
I'm uh, oh my goodness. Sorry. I don't know what I was saying. That sounded like a crazy person

1289
01:59:42,300 --> 01:59:47,900
What I was trying to communicate was uh, am I able to

1290
01:59:48,860 --> 01:59:51,660
Authenticiously, I don't know what the fuck that word means

1291
01:59:52,540 --> 01:59:57,500
Uh, I'm just gonna scavenge a little bit. Oh, no, I'm not because there's tons of enemies that way

1292
01:59:57,660 --> 02:00:02,700
Uh, I don't really actually want to go that way. I guess the store is locked the store is not well

1293
02:00:02,780 --> 02:00:08,140
Okay, I'm just going to follow the arrow because there's too much going on right now. I'm to go down. Okay. We're going down

1294
02:00:09,100 --> 02:00:11,100
Oh, something's tingling

1295
02:00:11,420 --> 02:00:12,940
And it's money

1296
02:00:12,940 --> 02:00:14,140
What?

1297
02:00:14,140 --> 02:00:21,660
You go a Reese you got yourselves a research camera press the rat trigger well focused on an enemy to start researching on the target

1298
02:00:23,020 --> 02:00:25,500
That thing's a miracle in technicolor kid

1299
02:00:26,060 --> 02:00:31,100
Works like a movie color start the film rolling before you open fire on a splice

1300
02:00:31,420 --> 02:00:37,900
And then anything you hit it with tells you more about his dna. Let's give it a dry run, shall we?

1301
02:00:40,380 --> 02:00:44,620
I dropped everything I was doing to ink as soon as I heard the first 10 seconds of that audio

1302
02:00:44,940 --> 02:00:46,940
Oh

1303
02:00:59,020 --> 02:01:02,140
Use plasma and weapons during research

1304
02:01:03,740 --> 02:01:05,740
What?

1305
02:01:05,740 --> 02:01:07,740
Oh

1306
02:01:25,820 --> 02:01:27,820
I think I missed that

1307
02:01:27,820 --> 02:01:31,900
Camera spits out a prize once in a while as you learn what makes a splice a tick

1308
02:01:32,540 --> 02:01:36,380
Now find one of those big old brutes and take them out on film

1309
02:01:36,860 --> 02:01:42,060
Before long you'll be able to brush aside that mess at the hotel. What?

1310
02:01:45,100 --> 02:01:47,100
You go research Bruce Slyther

1311
02:01:48,300 --> 02:01:53,020
I'm getting this team notification nice for an achievement, but it's not like popping up

1312
02:01:53,500 --> 02:01:57,100
I wonder because I broke I broke the game so I declare I broke the game

1313
02:02:03,180 --> 02:02:05,180
Heavens

1314
02:02:06,540 --> 02:02:11,420
Uh a whole five, but don't mind if I do is there a munitions

1315
02:02:12,540 --> 02:02:14,460
location

1316
02:02:14,460 --> 02:02:18,620
No plenty of spices to study. Okay. I can say that four minutes is enough

1317
02:02:18,780 --> 02:02:24,940
That camera's a bit like telling a joke each time you tell it the same way it gets a little more stale

1318
02:02:24,940 --> 02:02:27,660
So you got to change it up to keep it fresh

1319
02:02:35,580 --> 02:02:38,780
Okay, you guys just do the daddy for me. Thank you

1320
02:02:49,580 --> 02:02:51,580
Are you okay?

1321
02:02:57,900 --> 02:03:03,660
I mean if he's gonna kill them for me, I don't see why I wouldn't just team up with another daddy, honestly

1322
02:03:10,940 --> 02:03:15,740
Oh shit wait, he didn't take that

1323
02:03:19,580 --> 02:03:21,580
I

1324
02:03:27,420 --> 02:03:29,420
Tried

1325
02:03:30,620 --> 02:03:33,020
I tried that was a bit shit. I'm like

1326
02:03:37,580 --> 02:03:39,900
But it's not even a little girl

1327
02:03:41,500 --> 02:03:43,660
Woman daddy are fighting again, honestly

1328
02:03:45,340 --> 02:03:47,980
And why are we cooking in this lab? No, hold on a minute

1329
02:03:48,940 --> 02:03:52,700
All right, let's just follow the arrow. I guess there wasn't a wee sister here

1330
02:03:53,580 --> 02:03:55,580
Yeah

1331
02:03:56,140 --> 02:03:58,140
First day

1332
02:03:59,100 --> 02:04:02,860
Right, okay hack the machine and then buy stuff

1333
02:04:04,860 --> 02:04:06,860
And then everything's cheap

1334
02:04:07,980 --> 02:04:11,420
Okay purchase items I would like

1335
02:04:13,820 --> 02:04:16,780
Munition lots of it

1336
02:04:19,580 --> 02:04:21,580
Uh

1337
02:04:26,300 --> 02:04:30,860
Aspirin a dose of aspirin will restore a moderate level of ease

1338
02:04:35,180 --> 02:04:37,180
Uh

1339
02:04:38,060 --> 02:04:40,060
Okay

1340
02:04:40,060 --> 02:04:42,060
That's better

1341
02:04:42,220 --> 02:04:45,900
It's a lot of money 500 bucks a lot. Is there not a little sister?

1342
02:04:46,860 --> 02:04:49,980
I guess no, I guess I didn't have to kill them all no feel bad

1343
02:04:50,780 --> 02:04:52,460
But I suck

1344
02:04:52,460 --> 02:04:59,180
I mean, I'm a terrible person inside and out. I can't believe I I did such a thing. Let me listen to this recording

1345
02:05:01,100 --> 02:05:04,540
I wish I could publish this stuff. It's newsman pay dirt

1346
02:05:07,100 --> 02:05:12,620
There's one of those big goons now start your camera rolling on him and then let

1347
02:05:13,340 --> 02:05:15,340
them have it

1348
02:05:18,060 --> 02:05:20,060
I like who he gets angry at me

1349
02:05:33,180 --> 02:05:35,500
Is this what I'm supposed to do

1350
02:05:35,740 --> 02:05:37,740
Oh

1351
02:05:38,060 --> 02:05:43,500
Roots splice a research new ability drill dash devastate your foes with this powerful dash attack

1352
02:05:44,220 --> 02:05:46,220
I get stronger

1353
02:05:46,460 --> 02:05:52,540
Look at you sport a regular junior shot above and it appears you've picked up a new trick from that big

1354
02:05:53,260 --> 02:05:59,100
Yeah, now get back to the Sinclair deluxe and just bust through that mess blocking your way just buzz

1355
02:05:59,900 --> 02:06:01,900
Oh

1356
02:06:02,300 --> 02:06:05,020
Press B while holding rate trigger to drill dash

1357
02:06:07,500 --> 02:06:13,980
So I'm not supposed to explore this area. I guess not. Okay. I'm not I'm not hanging around to find out any extra facts

1358
02:06:14,060 --> 02:06:16,300
Okay, I'm just going back to where the game telling me to go

1359
02:06:19,340 --> 02:06:24,940
For grace the paradise of Andrew Ryan was most unkind

1360
02:06:25,260 --> 02:06:32,060
Why yeah, she spoke against him in song and he had her block listed it left her panellists

1361
02:06:33,020 --> 02:06:38,620
But in the family she has found hope a reason to draw breath

1362
02:06:40,540 --> 02:06:45,100
Ask yourself delta do you deserve to take it from her?

1363
02:06:46,380 --> 02:06:50,540
Uh, yes, I believe there is something very important down there

1364
02:06:50,540 --> 02:06:56,700
I swear if I'm going to ship my pantaloons because I'm exploring where I shouldn't be

1365
02:06:59,900 --> 02:07:05,420
Why are you respawning I've already been in this location. I wish the game wouldn't respawn

1366
02:07:06,140 --> 02:07:08,540
enemies at places I have already been

1367
02:07:10,300 --> 02:07:15,820
I swear if you telling me there's something down here when there ain't I'm going to be so scared

1368
02:07:16,060 --> 02:07:22,460
What am I looking for I don't I'm not sure oh, there's uh firestorm

1369
02:07:23,340 --> 02:07:27,580
Ryan industries presents a warm welcome for your enemies with firestorms

1370
02:07:27,580 --> 02:07:34,780
Set your foes afire when they strike you. Okay, that actually was pretty worth. Oh my goodness

1371
02:07:34,860 --> 02:07:40,380
It's mints. Why the fuck? Why does the video games always pick on fucking cats and games? I have to admit

1372
02:07:41,340 --> 02:07:43,340
I'm not annoying. What's the word

1373
02:07:44,220 --> 02:07:46,220
Better upset

1374
02:07:50,860 --> 02:07:56,060
Now hold on a minute. I want to take a photo of you real quick. Hold on. I just wanted absolutely a blue little rich

1375
02:07:59,500 --> 02:08:01,500
Increase damage

1376
02:08:01,660 --> 02:08:03,660
lead head splice

1377
02:08:03,980 --> 02:08:05,500
vulnerable to

1378
02:08:05,500 --> 02:08:09,980
Antipersonal rise. This is a lot of words for Elmo. I have to admit a lot of words right now

1379
02:08:10,300 --> 02:08:13,820
Go down where you fight the brood if you would kind of

1380
02:08:19,660 --> 02:08:21,660
Okay, I'll go back one more time

1381
02:08:23,180 --> 02:08:28,620
Just take a photo before unaliving them. This is the action shot two minutes later

1382
02:08:32,220 --> 02:08:34,220
Okay, now there's something patrolling in here

1383
02:08:40,220 --> 02:08:42,220
I

1384
02:08:44,060 --> 02:08:47,900
Hold on. Let me really real quick. I'm gonna beat the fuck out of this century to it

1385
02:08:50,620 --> 02:08:57,180
Oh, am I gonna hack it? Maybe I should no wait what I can do an action shot on the fucking camera

1386
02:08:58,220 --> 02:09:05,020
Okay, increased damage security elements are vulnerable to armor pissing rounds and electricity

1387
02:09:05,180 --> 02:09:07,660
Okay, that's rather funny. I find that rather

1388
02:09:08,300 --> 02:09:13,500
That did give me a little bit of a tee he on the inside. That was that I found that rather interesting

1389
02:09:14,380 --> 02:09:16,780
All right, uh, there is something down here

1390
02:09:17,660 --> 02:09:19,260
little

1391
02:09:19,260 --> 02:09:20,460
reward for

1392
02:09:20,460 --> 02:09:22,460
exploring. Oh my what is this

1393
02:09:23,900 --> 02:09:25,900
Here father, it's yours

1394
02:09:26,460 --> 02:09:32,860
You are evolving fast, but your heart is getting weaker. I can keep you alive, but you must find me

1395
02:09:33,260 --> 02:09:35,260
Oh

1396
02:09:35,340 --> 02:09:39,420
My lord, you have run out of plasma slots, but you can

1397
02:09:40,300 --> 02:09:43,740
Store or replace them at a later gene bank. That's fine

1398
02:09:45,180 --> 02:09:53,340
Confuse your foes into attacking one another. Fuck telekinesis. Actually, no way. Take away incinerate

1399
02:09:55,580 --> 02:10:00,300
Wahoo hypnotize your foes laugh as they fight each other

1400
02:10:01,260 --> 02:10:02,300
I

1401
02:10:02,300 --> 02:10:04,300
Evolved today. Oh my

1402
02:10:24,060 --> 02:10:26,700
Oh, but they were so romantic with one another

1403
02:10:30,860 --> 02:10:36,540
I do admit that was rather mean of me

1404
02:10:39,900 --> 02:10:43,100
Oh, yeah, they were just trying to have a romantical moment together

1405
02:10:44,540 --> 02:10:51,580
Mindbreak acquired. I'm very happy. So is this kind of like bonus exploring you should not have come

1406
02:10:52,220 --> 02:10:55,100
Um, actually, I encourage it. So I'm not really sure

1407
02:11:01,260 --> 02:11:04,060
Bomb goes off in that fancy place up town and

1408
02:11:04,780 --> 02:11:06,780
God is in the people

1409
02:11:07,500 --> 02:11:09,500
All right

1410
02:11:11,020 --> 02:11:15,900
I supposed to get rewarded with supplies for exploring outside just to the 360 right there

1411
02:11:18,300 --> 02:11:22,220
Who's gonna come here me night and gale and about how they are

1412
02:11:23,180 --> 02:11:25,180
They

1413
02:11:31,100 --> 02:11:33,740
Oh, nope, my apologies. I got the

1414
02:11:34,700 --> 02:11:40,220
Oh, no, I think I'm fine with the gene bank right now weapon upgrade in that room

1415
02:11:44,380 --> 02:11:46,380
In the jazz lounge or in here

1416
02:11:50,380 --> 02:11:54,220
That must be back there in the jazz

1417
02:11:55,020 --> 02:11:58,300
That says gene bank right there was

1418
02:12:01,980 --> 02:12:06,860
Just give oh, I see it. I see it. I believe this is it up here. I apologize

1419
02:12:07,580 --> 02:12:11,580
My apologies. What are you there? Thank you very much

1420
02:12:12,460 --> 02:12:13,900
now

1421
02:12:13,900 --> 02:12:15,900
I would like to

1422
02:12:16,540 --> 02:12:22,380
Oh, I'm still missing something. I'm too gay. I'm two hours into the game and I'm actually still missing some I am

1423
02:12:23,260 --> 02:12:30,460
Uh, I would like to upgrade the damage of my shotgun

1424
02:12:33,180 --> 02:12:37,100
I believe because it seems to

1425
02:12:38,700 --> 02:12:42,380
Be good now. Are you okay?

1426
02:12:43,260 --> 02:12:45,260
I

1427
02:12:46,380 --> 02:12:53,180
Would it be all right if I excuse myself to get myself a little cola would that be all right with you?

1428
02:12:55,180 --> 02:12:58,060
Why it's telling me to go well

1429
02:12:59,900 --> 02:13:03,340
It's telling me to use the piano hold on

1430
02:13:03,980 --> 02:13:05,980
Oh

1431
02:13:10,220 --> 02:13:15,740
In real life by all means all right, I'm gonna get me a shoulder

1432
02:13:17,180 --> 02:13:21,980
Momentarily to beat this heat that I'm experiencing

1433
02:13:23,020 --> 02:13:25,020
because it is summer

1434
02:13:25,260 --> 02:13:26,780
in

1435
02:13:26,780 --> 02:13:28,780
the Americas

1436
02:13:29,020 --> 02:13:35,420
And oh boy, it's hot especially in Louisiana. That's why we like our iced tea

1437
02:13:36,940 --> 02:13:42,460
Now it might not necessarily be louisianian, but that's all right

1438
02:13:43,580 --> 02:13:45,580
We just doing our things

1439
02:13:50,380 --> 02:13:52,700
Well, I'm lucky I saw that oil slick

1440
02:13:53,100 --> 02:14:01,500
How on earth did that still hurt me even after that no stop you literally walked through fire to get me good sir

1441
02:14:03,660 --> 02:14:06,060
I was how are you not dead?

1442
02:14:07,020 --> 02:14:08,700

1443
02:14:08,700 --> 02:14:14,620
You get electrocuted you get burned and I'm still your enemy. Are you being no get back here?

1444
02:14:16,140 --> 02:14:18,220
No, I don't care come and get back here. You're dead

1445
02:14:18,780 --> 02:14:23,980
Why am I actually getting

1446
02:14:29,500 --> 02:14:34,860
Why are you guys all of a sudden a lot harder out of nowhere? Hold on. I'm beating the absolute

1447
02:14:37,260 --> 02:14:39,260
Did that do anything at the top?

1448
02:14:40,060 --> 02:14:42,060
Okay, I guess we have to go through

1449
02:14:42,860 --> 02:14:45,900
On our big sister's probably the next upgrade

1450
02:14:46,380 --> 02:14:50,700
Louisiana down south. We call it a coke. Ah, I say coda

1451
02:14:51,260 --> 02:14:55,420
I was a waitress back in the day and there was a lot of

1452
02:14:56,460 --> 02:14:58,460
Confuzzlement a lot of confusions

1453
02:14:58,940 --> 02:15:00,940
created

1454
02:15:01,180 --> 02:15:04,300
Because of just rev up that drill your

1455
02:15:05,180 --> 02:15:10,380
Uh slam right through that polar. So I had to specify fool

1456
02:15:11,260 --> 02:15:12,700
fool

1457
02:15:12,700 --> 02:15:14,700
Fat polar

1458
02:15:15,420 --> 02:15:19,740
Or else it sometimes just didn't quite work the weight

1459
02:15:20,540 --> 02:15:26,540
Now gracey was on the top floor get on up there and persuade her to give you that override key

1460
02:15:27,180 --> 02:15:32,700
Do you want an override key? I'll print that out. Can I have an override key please?

1461
02:15:34,460 --> 02:15:36,460
Oh

1462
02:15:37,340 --> 02:15:44,540
Well, I didn't realize you was just napping. Excuse me, madame. It was not my intention to upset you in that way. What is this?

1463
02:15:45,580 --> 02:15:53,580
Got the rapture blues call dr. Lam. You satisfied low on pep worried about money don't know where to turn

1464
02:15:55,340 --> 02:15:57,340
Oh, I have a flashlight

1465
02:16:00,700 --> 02:16:02,700
Well, I don't like this one bit

1466
02:16:03,420 --> 02:16:05,660
I'm gonna turn around and all these are gonna

1467
02:16:07,180 --> 02:16:09,180
I

1468
02:16:12,860 --> 02:16:14,860
Are you heartless bro

1469
02:16:14,940 --> 02:16:20,860
Who are you calling heartless man when you're the one attacking me? I'm just the one that's you know chilling and stuff

1470
02:16:21,100 --> 02:16:23,900
Uh, let's try and hack this I guess bonk

1471
02:16:25,820 --> 02:16:28,220
Bonk bonk bonk bonk

1472
02:16:30,540 --> 02:16:32,540
Bing bing bing

1473
02:16:33,100 --> 02:16:36,700
Might as well put the upgrade and take it, you know, you're drill nerd

1474
02:16:38,220 --> 02:16:46,540
I knew it. I was I knew you were gonna do something like that. Now. Just give me one moment. I'm gonna go grab me a pop

1475
02:16:46,940 --> 02:16:48,940
Okay, um, I don't even need to

1476
02:17:03,020 --> 02:17:05,020
All right

1477
02:17:05,340 --> 02:17:10,700
Let me see what's going on. No, don't puke. I was literally gone for a second. I didn't mean nothing

1478
02:17:12,620 --> 02:17:15,100
I'm an elite hack. So I am

1479
02:17:15,980 --> 02:17:19,420
Little sisters in this level one is with their daddy one is free

1480
02:17:19,980 --> 02:17:21,340
Who goes there?

1481
02:17:21,340 --> 02:17:23,260
Wait, do I have to

1482
02:17:23,260 --> 02:17:28,300
How many endings does this game have does it have multiple endings if I don't get all the little sisters?

1483
02:17:28,700 --> 02:17:30,700
What's going on

1484
02:17:31,180 --> 02:17:33,900
It's so hot in my room, but I just got an ice breeze

1485
02:17:34,860 --> 02:17:41,820
Exactly one second. I'm uh, drink me my soda pop or whatever the what we refer to it back in the rapture

1486
02:17:45,820 --> 02:17:47,820
Why

1487
02:17:48,780 --> 02:17:53,740
I'm a burp right in your mouth. Do I do apologize? But please do open nice and wide for me

1488
02:17:54,300 --> 02:17:58,780
There you go. That's fantastic. Keep that up. You swallowed that. All right, darling

1489
02:18:09,020 --> 02:18:11,020
There are multiple endings

1490
02:18:13,340 --> 02:18:19,740
All right, well, I hope I at least get the nice ending whether or not I actually get it. There's a whole different story

1491
02:18:20,620 --> 02:18:22,620
Who goes there identify yourself

1492
02:18:24,220 --> 02:18:26,220
Oh

1493
02:18:40,540 --> 02:18:42,540
Am I drunk

1494
02:18:42,540 --> 02:18:47,660
Wait, you can get drunk on alcohol in this game. I thought I just get into some trouble

1495
02:18:48,380 --> 02:18:55,260
I didn't realize you could get drunk drunk. I guess when I'm consuming them atoms to repair any

1496
02:18:57,420 --> 02:18:59,420
HP, etc

1497
02:19:00,620 --> 02:19:03,260
You can get you can get drunk by buying alcohol too

1498
02:19:03,260 --> 02:19:05,260
I

1499
02:19:13,260 --> 02:19:18,780
Wait, why are you running away? Why why the fuck is this a horror map? Let me in

1500
02:19:23,660 --> 02:19:26,780
I saw that with the foot is there something running away from

1501
02:19:34,220 --> 02:19:36,220
Ah

1502
02:19:44,460 --> 02:19:49,180
Real-life kill tip you can get steam in if you drink alcohol. You don't have to drink alcohol

1503
02:19:53,420 --> 02:19:55,420
Hell's already filled that one looks

1504
02:19:56,140 --> 02:20:00,860
I mean, oh my apologies. Sorry my my action. I don't know what's going on one minute

1505
02:20:01,260 --> 02:20:05,740
I pretend I'm from Scotland next minute. I'm transatlantic. I don't know what's going on here

1506
02:20:09,740 --> 02:20:16,140
Quick little uh buggers aren't they? Yes, I do declare. I'd rather agree to such um

1507
02:20:16,940 --> 02:20:19,340
What's going on here? What is this? A box?

1508
02:20:20,460 --> 02:20:23,180
Uh, I think I know why there's a bot shutdown option

1509
02:20:25,820 --> 02:20:28,460
Alpha foxy wait, so what do I do this?

1510
02:20:31,820 --> 02:20:33,820
No

1511
02:20:36,220 --> 02:20:39,180
I'm supposed to hack them and then a bumblebee comes out. I'm not sure

1512
02:20:41,020 --> 02:20:46,060
All right, let's see. What are you you have run out of slots, but that's okay. Go to who a gene bank

1513
02:20:46,300 --> 02:20:51,100
That's fine. Leave your foes out in the cold with a freezing drill

1514
02:20:53,900 --> 02:20:55,900
Well, I don't

1515
02:20:56,860 --> 02:20:59,740
I love it. Who are you?

1516
02:21:03,980 --> 02:21:06,380
I have a chance to freeze that's kind of cool

1517
02:21:12,140 --> 02:21:17,980
Yes, yes, yes, Dr. Lam. Hold on a minute. I need to I need to get back. Oh shit. I forgot to hack that oops

1518
02:21:18,460 --> 02:21:20,460
paid fill price

1519
02:21:26,460 --> 02:21:32,060
Sorry, I know you're trying to tell me some of the lore right now, but I'm too dumb to figure out how to unlock most slots

1520
02:21:32,220 --> 02:21:34,220
I assume it comes later

1521
02:21:40,620 --> 02:21:43,500
I'm not dying alone. What are you talking about?

1522
02:21:55,900 --> 02:21:57,900
All right

1523
02:22:19,500 --> 02:22:21,500
Don't take from your own

1524
02:22:22,460 --> 02:22:24,940
I don't know I do this it's gonna like

1525
02:22:36,540 --> 02:22:41,420
Your drills run out. No, okay, I guess you can only do one thing

1526
02:22:46,460 --> 02:22:48,460
Why did you blow up?

1527
02:22:51,500 --> 02:22:53,500
Beast

1528
02:22:57,420 --> 02:23:02,780
Sorry, I'm having a stroke trying to talk like that all the time. Give me give me give me five minutes to recover

1529
02:23:03,740 --> 02:23:05,740
I'll do it again, but I need to like five minutes

1530
02:23:08,140 --> 02:23:11,340
It's like messing up a brain trying to like all complete at the same time

1531
02:23:18,460 --> 02:23:20,460
Grace's room is just up ahead

1532
02:23:20,540 --> 02:23:23,980
Now she's been sending all manner unkindness your way

1533
02:23:23,980 --> 02:23:27,900
So I'm not particular as to how you take that key away from her

1534
02:23:27,900 --> 02:23:32,860
But she's old and his grudge against you was based on a misunderstanding

1535
02:23:34,940 --> 02:23:39,020
Always the misunderstanding look I'm the good guy. You just don't believe me

1536
02:23:43,580 --> 02:23:45,900
Oh, I got a whole evil syringe from her

1537
02:23:46,700 --> 02:23:48,700
I

1538
02:23:49,740 --> 02:23:55,660
Stony sweet food tea flavor versus original flavor. Oh, we're oh, hey mommy. We're mommy go

1539
02:24:08,140 --> 02:24:13,580
Get more bang for your research buck on keen observe carry your analysis further than

1540
02:24:16,620 --> 02:24:21,500
I'm not bothered about that one unless I'm like being a dumb dumb. I like it so far

1541
02:24:21,660 --> 02:24:27,020
I'm I just I feel like I'm very sucky right now, which is a bit rough, but you can't win them all

1542
02:24:27,500 --> 02:24:29,660
Eleanor baby, where are you?

1543
02:24:30,540 --> 02:24:34,380
I turned my back and someone took you it happened so quick

1544
02:24:35,340 --> 02:24:39,100
I'm not even a half mama to your girl. I couldn't protect you

1545
02:24:39,980 --> 02:24:43,980
This poster of dr. Lam in my room is staring me down like

1546
02:24:45,660 --> 02:24:47,660
What

1547
02:24:48,540 --> 02:24:54,860
Hi, it's big daddy. I know what you hear. Oh, she's not even scared of me gone take it

1548
02:24:55,740 --> 02:24:57,740
I won't have you touching me

1549
02:24:58,940 --> 02:25:03,180
I'm the good guy. She says she kills everyone. I'm putting everyone other a misery

1550
02:25:04,780 --> 02:25:06,780
But baby Eleanor disappeared

1551
02:25:07,500 --> 02:25:11,340
And then one day I see her walking with you

1552
02:25:12,300 --> 02:25:14,300
looking wrong

1553
02:25:17,740 --> 02:25:19,740
You knock me down

1554
02:25:20,860 --> 02:25:22,860
broke my jaw

1555
02:25:23,100 --> 02:25:29,660
So I'm ready baby snatcher come on in and finish the job. I don't want to kill you

1556
02:25:33,260 --> 02:25:35,260
Do I actually have to kill her

1557
02:25:36,460 --> 02:25:42,140
There's no way I actually have to kill your call friend grace is unarmed for what it's worth

1558
02:25:43,740 --> 02:25:46,940
Sinclair, why do you want me to like perish everyone?

1559
02:25:48,220 --> 02:25:51,660
I literally have no interest in her. I have no need to kill her

1560
02:25:53,580 --> 02:25:55,580
Come on

1561
02:25:56,060 --> 02:26:02,620
You're a bigger man than I am chief. We shouldn't do anything twice about pointing fingers before all the facts are in

1562
02:26:03,180 --> 02:26:07,820
Now let's be on our way collect all adam you can before going to the next level

1563
02:26:11,100 --> 02:26:14,860
Is that a thing I don't know where to find the little is there a map?

1564
02:26:16,460 --> 02:26:18,460
Oh piece

1565
02:26:18,940 --> 02:26:21,900
There's no way I'm able to backtrack like that

1566
02:26:22,940 --> 02:26:24,940
I

1567
02:26:26,460 --> 02:26:31,980
Am I gonna am I gonna lock myself out of progress if I don't collect all that adam?

1568
02:26:32,780 --> 02:26:34,780
Like I'm not gonna get stuck Emma

1569
02:26:37,020 --> 02:26:41,900
I don't know if I can backtrack successfully my brain doesn't really I'm on level five

1570
02:26:43,740 --> 02:26:47,100
There's like five floors to this place. There's no way

1571
02:26:47,500 --> 02:26:49,500
Hey

1572
02:26:49,820 --> 02:26:54,140
There's no way I think I think I saw you just make it harder

1573
02:26:55,020 --> 02:26:57,020
Just find the big daddy

1574
02:26:57,260 --> 02:27:00,460
You had me under a gun yet you just walk away

1575
02:27:02,140 --> 02:27:04,860
No monster life turns the other cheek

1576
02:27:05,980 --> 02:27:07,980
No monster does that

1577
02:27:08,780 --> 02:27:10,940
A thinking man does that

1578
02:27:11,740 --> 02:27:18,140
You have to save every sister to get good end and I think I already lost so if that's the case

1579
02:27:19,900 --> 02:27:21,900
Why is the music so sexy?

1580
02:27:23,740 --> 02:27:25,740
I don't the fuck out of you two's music

1581
02:27:27,260 --> 02:27:29,900
Wait, so then is it gonna register on my mother's floor now?

1582
02:27:31,020 --> 02:27:33,180
Sorry, I'm vending machine

1583
02:27:34,380 --> 02:27:36,380
Oh, there's so much backtracking

1584
02:27:37,020 --> 02:27:41,100
Can I just make the game difficult for myself and then cry to you when it gets difficult?

1585
02:27:44,380 --> 02:27:49,420
Uh, Emma, can I just cry to you when it gets difficult and I get frustrated

1586
02:27:51,100 --> 02:27:54,380
If I or how about I make a deal you get another audio on

1587
02:27:55,260 --> 02:27:58,540
Alt twitter if I end up getting annoyed at myself at this game

1588
02:27:59,660 --> 02:28:03,900
How about that? That's how we're gonna do it. I know the doctor lamb is no liar

1589
02:28:03,980 --> 02:28:09,100
Okay, thank you man for trying to keep me right in the game, but I'm just say okay. I'm say

1590
02:28:19,660 --> 02:28:22,460
What so she makes the game easier for me now a little bit

1591
02:28:25,100 --> 02:28:27,100
Does she feel nice?

1592
02:28:34,060 --> 02:28:36,060

1725
02:40:52,460 --> 02:40:57,260
I am very low on supplies though for a fight. I'm not sure I want to do this

1726
02:40:57,900 --> 02:40:59,900
And

1727

1733
02:41:42,540 --> 02:41:46,460
Well, I think I've messed up to be honest. I think I should have bought health pack

1734
02:41:52,700 --> 02:41:54,700
Oh

1735
02:42:02,220 --> 02:42:04,220
Oh

1736
02:42:18,220 --> 02:42:20,220
Oh

1737
02:42:23,420 --> 02:42:26,300
I don't have any long range weapon

1738
02:42:30,700 --> 02:42:34,860
To be honest, I'm gonna say something controversial and you guys aren't gonna like it

1739
02:42:36,540 --> 02:42:38,540
For easy mode the shit isn't easy

1740
02:42:39,740 --> 02:42:42,700
I said what I said the shit is not easy for easy mode

1741
02:42:45,580 --> 02:42:50,940
Like actual controversial it's uh, this is not easy. I'm not finding this easy at all

1742
02:42:51,500 --> 02:42:53,500
Wait, any time

1743
02:42:59,100 --> 02:43:03,820
I'm like, stop it. I'm not finding this easy. I'm finding this hard

1744
02:43:05,100 --> 02:43:09,100
Literally me when the me when the game says it's easy, but it's not

1745
02:43:11,260 --> 02:43:16,220
I'm finding it difficult. I'm feeling oh my god. I have 69 dollars

1746
02:43:17,100 --> 02:43:23,660
Like right I'm gonna put her away. She needs to go through a tunnel

1747
02:43:26,140 --> 02:43:28,140
Oh, I bet you find it hard I do

1748
02:43:29,660 --> 02:43:31,660
Like that's why I was like, okay, I think

1749
02:43:33,900 --> 02:43:38,460
I think that's why we're gonna be right you go home

1750
02:43:41,260 --> 02:43:45,340
Are we sure it's not accidentally on normal mode again the pro gamer is struggling

1751
02:43:46,940 --> 02:43:51,500
I'm though like I'm not even embarrassed to admit. I'm like fuck. So this is getting hard

1752
02:43:53,420 --> 02:43:55,420
What is it not graphed?

1753
02:43:57,660 --> 02:44:03,020
This is easy like when a game's easy, I expect to like tank everything

1754
02:44:07,020 --> 02:44:12,700
Why why is a big sister coming for me? I've not even done anything

1755
02:44:16,620 --> 02:44:24,300
I'm literally about to die. I'm not even kidding. I'm literally about to die in game because I suck so badly

1756
02:44:24,300 --> 02:44:26,300
Okay

Tap out

1790
02:47:55,980 --> 02:47:59,020
I had to tap out when she was making me but she was like

1799
02:48:42,300 --> 02:48:44,940
Looks like the good father's kept up with the code locks

1800
02:48:45,420 --> 02:48:50,620
Time was only way to join with dark lamb was to beg and you should have seen mercy getting the pizza

1801
02:48:50,780 --> 02:48:54,620

Ambitious and I'm like stuff. I'm gonna cream

1804
02:49:13,740 --> 02:49:16,860
Yeah, like 10 minutes of gameplay I was gonna play uh

1805
02:49:17,660 --> 02:49:19,660
game boards

1806
02:49:19,980 --> 02:49:23,420
In the sims where we're all pure like I was gonna make us in the sims

1807
02:49:23,980 --> 02:49:28,140
I'm delayed it because I didn't realize that she be was gonna do some sports. I delayed it a little

1808
02:49:29,100 --> 02:49:36,300
You have an amazing accent by the way, I don't know what you're just talking about. I'm actually from I'm uh atlantic

1809
02:49:42,140 --> 02:49:46,460
Let me in let me in new goal find Daniel

1810
02:49:48,380 --> 02:49:50,380
Damn Daniel back at it again

1811
02:49:50,380 --> 02:49:52,940
for any of you are who are familiar with

1812
02:49:53,260 --> 02:49:57,900
Um this game. I just want to say apologies. No, you do not have to watch the gameplay

1813
02:49:58,300 --> 02:50:04,060
I absolutely suck at this. I'm literally on easy mode and uh, it's like it. Why did you just sound like Eddie Murphy?

1814
02:50:04,140 --> 02:50:07,180
No, it's not a transatlantic accent. I've been doing it

1815
02:50:07,820 --> 02:50:08,540
um

1816
02:50:08,540 --> 02:50:11,500
The transatlantic accent because it's what the games they like

1817
02:50:11,740 --> 02:50:17,500
Oh, I do declare and they sound like this and they talk our parts and nas and our familiar

1818
02:50:17,900 --> 02:50:19,100
um

1819
02:50:19,100 --> 02:50:23,820
And they put a little trill on the end of their voice and the way they say certain terminologies

1820
02:50:24,300 --> 02:50:26,300
But I do thank you, uh

1821
02:50:26,540 --> 02:50:28,540
that to the harem

1822
02:50:28,620 --> 02:50:29,740
and

1823
02:50:29,740 --> 02:50:32,060
Oh Jesus what is going on in here?

1824
02:50:33,180 --> 02:50:37,100
I appear to have unlocked a spear a harpoon

1825
02:50:38,940 --> 02:50:41,660
I'm gonna fuck her with that harpoon

1826
02:50:42,060 --> 02:50:44,060
Oh

1827
02:50:46,060 --> 02:50:54,460
My I did not it is what the fuck are you? No, I'm not dealing with that. So it's up theory

1828
02:50:59,260 --> 02:51:03,660
No one call her tell her it's called a transatlantic accent

1829
02:51:07,020 --> 02:51:09,820
It's called transatlantic because people came over from

1830
02:51:11,820 --> 02:51:13,820
Maddening notion that I owe you

1831
02:51:14,780 --> 02:51:18,540
He just tanked to that. Are you serious? He just tanked that entire thing

1832
02:51:21,660 --> 02:51:23,420
Oh, yeah

1833
02:51:23,420 --> 02:51:29,900
Beast what are you the drills empty? I've only got spears. Maybe he's weak to spears

1834
02:51:35,020 --> 02:51:37,740
I don't know what you're saying because I'm too busy investing in the gameplay

1835
02:51:38,460 --> 02:51:40,460
I'm doing busy

1836
02:51:43,340 --> 02:51:45,340
The spear gun is percent up drops

1837
02:51:49,980 --> 02:51:51,980
My god

1838
02:51:53,100 --> 02:51:57,420
Is this easy mode? No, it's not. I'm shite. He's off

1839
02:51:59,020 --> 02:52:04,620
Oh, wait, I'm supposed to go this way. Oh, I hate when I have to go that way because that's where the enemies are

1840
02:52:08,540 --> 02:52:10,540
Oh, I'm out of ammo

1841
02:52:14,300 --> 02:52:21,260
Do you mind? Oh my god, I'm just sorry. I'm just constantly available. Oh my god, Sony. Just go to reload station

1842
02:52:26,540 --> 02:52:33,340
I know I know I know I should go and spend all my money's at reload station, but I suck

1843
02:52:34,140 --> 02:52:40,140
And this is why you're getting an audio at the end of this for begging for forgiveness for this terrible gameplay

1844
02:52:41,260 --> 02:52:44,540
No, I don't want to hack it. I want to destroy it. I'm like literally under it

1845
02:52:46,780 --> 02:52:48,780
Geez

1846
02:52:50,860 --> 02:52:52,700
So

1847
02:52:52,700 --> 02:52:57,260
What is this game about? You know more than I do. I'm gonna be honest. You know more than I do

1848
02:52:57,980 --> 02:53:05,580
It's about constantly being out of ammo and desperately searching through your inventory for a fucking splice of a lick of ammo

1849
02:53:07,180 --> 02:53:09,500
Because uh, I'm getting desperate

1850
02:53:12,060 --> 02:53:15,340
But yeah, I'm glad she'd be at a good uh Sims 4 collab

1851
02:53:15,340 --> 02:53:22,220
I was gonna do it that we're poor and we're opening up a restaurant, but there's like this thing called like rags to riches

1852
02:53:22,780 --> 02:53:24,140
um

1853
02:53:24,140 --> 02:53:25,980
that you can do

1854
02:53:25,980 --> 02:53:27,980
Um, and I was just gonna do that

1855
02:53:33,420 --> 02:53:34,540
Hey

1856
02:53:34,540 --> 02:53:36,860
Sorry, I thought I had to use tail pieces to do that

1857
02:53:37,660 --> 02:53:44,140
Um, and it's called rags to riches and I was gonna make this open up a hotel. Hey, no not a hotel cafe

1858
02:53:45,900 --> 02:53:47,900
What's going on

1859
02:53:50,300 --> 02:53:53,500
Ah, sorry, I'm literally just gonna have to go to drill this again ridiculous

1860
02:53:56,780 --> 02:54:00,460
I'm no laughing anymore

1861
02:54:03,900 --> 02:54:09,500
Where's that reload station? Yeah, I'm in my nether and these kind of guys. I thought this was gonna be easy

1862
02:54:16,700 --> 02:54:18,220
What's that?

1863
02:54:18,220 --> 02:54:23,980
I'm gonna download a mod tomorrow that makes me have infinite hp. What are you talking about?

1864
02:54:23,980 --> 02:54:28,060
I would never do something like that. With hackers delayed to your body converts the all

1865
02:54:30,060 --> 02:54:35,900
Altered current from a hacked machine into a powerful healing agent hack and heal

1866
02:54:37,740 --> 02:54:39,740
If any of you are hacking

1867
02:54:44,300 --> 02:54:46,300
Uh, I do have a like

1868
02:54:46,300 --> 02:54:48,300
I

1869
02:54:50,860 --> 02:54:55,500
Just fuck so much I'm gonna have to look out look out what I'm supposed to do

1870
02:54:57,180 --> 02:55:00,620
Watching you play this I wouldn't have known this is easy difficulty without you saying

1871
02:55:07,260 --> 02:55:10,940
At least Ryan never what oh congrats if your name's Ryan by the way

1872
02:55:17,180 --> 02:55:19,180
So

1873
02:55:24,700 --> 02:55:26,700
I think I can hear a big daddy

1874
02:55:29,900 --> 02:55:32,700
Like am I not a fucking beast right now?

1875
02:55:35,580 --> 02:55:37,580
And I'm getting fucking annihilated

1876
02:55:39,740 --> 02:55:44,620
I'm actually I'm sorry. I'm actually download a mod when we play this tomorrow to make this seem easy

1877
02:55:44,860 --> 02:55:46,860
Because this is not easy

1878
02:55:47,900 --> 02:55:50,540
You just suck. Yes. I'm aware. I suck. Okay, and you swallow

1879
02:55:57,100 --> 02:56:02,940
Like I have nothing I have nothing I have fucking nothing

1880
02:56:05,820 --> 02:56:07,820
But need my money heals me nothing

1881
02:56:08,380 --> 02:56:13,020
I'm nothing but a packet of crisps to my name right now and I'm not even supposed to go this way

1882
02:56:19,980 --> 02:56:26,380
Actually, I'm in a tin can start acting like I'm in a tin can because everyone goes you need king can

1883
02:56:27,500 --> 02:56:31,260
Oh, is that a boss? Oops. I didn't even know I was going against the boss. Sorry

1884
02:56:38,700 --> 02:56:40,700
It's an animal bullet

1885
02:56:44,860 --> 02:56:51,900
I'm somehow doing great. Why is the arrow changing? I'm about to go down our art arrow. Where are you trying to take me down here?

1886
02:56:54,140 --> 02:56:59,020
No, I'm following the arrow like my life depends on it. Oh, no

1887
02:57:01,660 --> 02:57:04,460
I don't even have the resources to fight keepers

1888
02:57:08,780 --> 02:57:10,780
I

1889
02:57:24,220 --> 02:57:27,500
Assume if I die the game's just like

1890
02:57:33,180 --> 02:57:35,180
Bro you can't make this up

1891
02:57:38,540 --> 02:57:42,380
Now through this junction is the rest of the alley including the very pump

1892
02:57:49,180 --> 02:57:54,060
Okay, hack and they're all behind me right now

1893
02:57:56,460 --> 02:58:00,700
Okay, okay, please give me a chance

1894
02:58:02,140 --> 02:58:04,140

Right, I've got my bumblebees. That's fine

1898
02:58:16,780 --> 02:58:19,100

You're better. I mean the code is oh sure. I wasn't paying attention to anything being said

1901
02:58:31,500 --> 02:58:34,780
Mm-hmm. Oh, I literally says right next to it

1902
02:58:38,460 --> 02:58:40,460
Oh

1903
02:58:43,500 --> 02:58:45,500

Oh, and I'm dead

I'm just gonna have to melee and hope that I get the freeze because this is like astronomically

1914
03:00:00,940 --> 03:00:02,940
Not in my favor right now

1915
03:00:03,900 --> 03:00:09,420
At least cult of the lamb did it right the drill is run out of fuel tap right trigger

Or a proc when they hit me that they get put on fire basically

1919
03:00:33,500 --> 03:00:36,380
I'm just hating in a corner right now

1920
03:00:43,100 --> 03:00:50,380
I'm hating I'm hating if you're struggling here and it's easy the infinite's gonna give me some problems

1921
03:00:53,020 --> 03:00:55,020
Monka

1922
03:00:55,020 --> 03:00:58,380
Can I just get you guys to play it and then I'll commentate over your gameplay?

1923
03:00:59,580 --> 03:01:01,580
That seems fair to me

1924
03:01:03,500 --> 03:01:05,500
I

1925
03:01:05,500 --> 03:01:07,500
Know lamb is our salvation

1926
03:01:08,380 --> 03:01:12,620
You shall not rob us of our literally dropping like one bullet

1927
03:01:14,060 --> 03:01:16,060
In bad in milk

1928
03:01:16,300 --> 03:01:22,140
I mean it has some difficulties the claim of the person on my bad. I don't know. I'm played it. Sure by him. I'm sure thing

1929
03:01:23,820 --> 03:01:27,980
Oh my god, we flown look at the way you're you're killing the enemies. You're so good

1930
03:01:28,700 --> 03:01:33,660
Yeah, come up here and fight me because I need I need to get free speck on you. I need that runescape

1931
03:01:37,660 --> 03:01:44,140
Uh, what was my other attack security electro or ice oh ice hold on

1932
03:01:47,340 --> 03:01:50,300
Okay, ice will be got it ice will be ice

1933
03:01:51,260 --> 03:01:58,220
Okay, there may be we may have a chance we may have a chance

1934
03:01:59,980 --> 03:02:02,380
We may have a chance. Hold on. It's not over

1935
03:02:04,220 --> 03:02:09,180
It's not over yet. We may have a chance. Oh, I can't even scavenge his body

1936
03:02:09,260 --> 03:02:11,260
I

1937
03:02:17,980 --> 03:02:22,540
Thought it's supposed to be like whenever they do easy mode it's supposed to be like

1938
03:02:24,540 --> 03:02:29,340
Enemies have way less health. You have way more damage resources, etc

1939
03:02:30,780 --> 03:02:34,780
But like I don't even have the ability to kill big daddy's right now

1940
03:02:39,420 --> 03:02:41,740
Is the cost of paradise

1941
03:02:42,780 --> 03:02:45,900
To end pain to end sin

1942
03:02:46,780 --> 03:02:49,260
Like he doesn't even have a wing so he's not even

1943
03:02:57,900 --> 03:02:59,900
Never main two is just hard

1944
03:03:09,660 --> 03:03:11,660
Oh

1945
03:03:11,980 --> 03:03:14,220
Sorry, I deserve take away after this game. Huh?

1946
03:03:15,340 --> 03:03:19,660
That's how I'm like go away. I just killed one of you

1947
03:03:21,100 --> 03:03:23,100
I don't care

1948
03:03:23,100 --> 03:03:25,100
And I've

1949
03:03:38,620 --> 03:03:40,620
Freezing a million today

1950
03:03:45,820 --> 03:03:48,540
She needs a drill there. Oh, I do have

1951
03:03:49,260 --> 03:03:56,460
No, piss it off. I'm not even doing this. I'm not even doing this, but I've go away. I need all the resources and I've got nothing

1952
03:03:57,500 --> 03:03:59,500
Other than a fucking pillowcase

1953
03:04:02,700 --> 03:04:04,700
I think I've got some sort going on

1954
03:04:06,380 --> 03:04:08,380
I need a weapons upgrade

1955
03:04:09,180 --> 03:04:11,180
I

1956
03:04:15,580 --> 03:04:17,580
Don't know why the audio got delayed there

1957
03:04:23,660 --> 03:04:26,940
Okay, so if I blow them up like with ace

1958
03:04:27,580 --> 03:04:33,500
I actually mess it up for myself because I can't even look their bodies because there's nothing left over at loot. Yeah, like

1959
03:04:33,820 --> 03:04:35,820
I

1960
03:04:36,300 --> 03:04:38,620
Feel like I'm making a worse for myself using my

1961
03:04:39,580 --> 03:04:42,780
Better shock adults had strange habits of making you clear waves of the wave

1962
03:04:44,220 --> 03:04:46,220
They said extend that gameplay the gameplay

1963
03:04:48,540 --> 03:04:51,500
Now we aren't doing a full we're doing the rest of the game tomorrow, so

1964
03:04:53,020 --> 03:04:55,980
I'm sure I can find a mod to make put myself in god mode

1965
03:04:58,940 --> 03:05:00,940
At least increase the fucking

1966
03:05:01,660 --> 03:05:03,660
Obviously

1967
03:05:05,340 --> 03:05:07,340
Therapy would be

1968
03:05:14,460 --> 03:05:16,940
God mode literally I'm putting god mode on out of here

1969
03:05:18,460 --> 03:05:20,460
Power to the people

1970
03:05:31,500 --> 03:05:34,540
But your voice inspires the people

1971
03:05:35,900 --> 03:05:39,340
I am asking you to join a much larger family

1972
03:05:40,140 --> 03:05:43,980
Though your body fail, but stroney, you're not taking damage. I'm just like

1973
03:05:45,020 --> 03:05:47,020
like

1974
03:05:49,980 --> 03:05:51,980
Machine gun damage

1975
03:05:52,220 --> 03:05:58,620
Reinforced barrels will live for increased muzzle pressure and a higher damage output. I just feel like going all in on damage

1976
03:05:59,580 --> 03:06:05,740
So it doesn't matter what have to use it's damageable. So when I do finally find some

1977
03:06:13,420 --> 03:06:15,420
Is there a boss fight in here? I think there may be

1978
03:06:24,860 --> 03:06:26,860
Hold on

1979
03:06:29,020 --> 03:06:31,020
Okay

1980
03:06:35,100 --> 03:06:40,860
Okay, god damn games like pop you halfway across the map. I need to take the drill

1981
03:06:44,780 --> 03:06:47,660
Okay, the drill in the ace combo definitely works

1982
03:06:53,260 --> 03:06:55,260
Can you have a moment to think geez

1983
03:06:58,700 --> 03:07:00,700
Oh, this isn't

1984
03:07:05,580 --> 03:07:07,580
Like literally this isn't

1985
03:07:15,100 --> 03:07:17,980
Easy mode by the way easy mode by the way

1986
03:07:22,940 --> 03:07:24,940
Easy fucking mode by the way

1987
03:07:29,180 --> 03:07:33,260
Can't make a shit off i'm fucking mid fight like having to go grab some stuff

1988
03:07:45,500 --> 03:07:47,500
Is that the boss?

1989
03:07:54,700 --> 03:07:57,500
Is that the fucking boss oh for fuck's sake

1990
03:07:59,420 --> 03:08:02,060
Can I hack that for myself

1991
03:08:05,980 --> 03:08:09,820
Uh, i'm i can hack mid fight you're joking right you're actually joking

1992
03:08:12,540 --> 03:08:14,540
Is that i knew the boss

1993
03:08:25,500 --> 03:08:27,500
I'm out of fucking fuel

1994
03:08:29,340 --> 03:08:36,380
I bloody hope this is the boss i'm getting shagged from that like over there. I literally have to back a pull off

1995
03:08:37,660 --> 03:08:40,620
I don't know. Okay. Uh, does anything happen?

1996
03:08:43,660 --> 03:08:44,940
Fuck oh

1997
03:08:44,940 --> 03:08:50,860
Oh my god, it may be hard, but I hope you're having fun at least like i'm enjoying the story and everything but like

1998
03:08:51,020 --> 03:08:53,020
I don't want to fucking

1999
03:08:53,980 --> 03:08:55,900
I have a stroke like

2000
03:08:55,900 --> 03:09:01,820
Trying to like sweat about user's management. I'm trying to enjoy the story like this is so cool

2001
03:09:03,020 --> 03:09:05,420
I'm trying to like rescue my daughter type thing

2002
03:09:16,460 --> 03:09:20,940
Like I will finish it don't get me wrong i'm gonna finish it because I really want to get to the point with the story but

2003
03:09:23,980 --> 03:09:28,380
Yeah, no, I know I've not rescued them all because I don't have fucking ammo or anything to rescue them

2004
03:09:29,580 --> 03:09:31,580
Oh my god, get to fuck honestly

2005
03:09:32,780 --> 03:09:35,420
Just take me to the next one sauce, but yours are all getting an audio

2006
03:09:35,420 --> 03:09:39,660
I'm like i'm really gonna be our word myself in this audio. I don't even care like i'm raging

2007
03:09:41,420 --> 03:09:43,420
Give me a map

2008
03:09:46,460 --> 03:09:48,460
You

2009
03:09:53,020 --> 03:09:55,020
To demonstrate

2010

Have I just killed myself lambs overloading the pumps the place is coming down get to Dionysus park

2011
03:10:06,220 --> 03:10:08,220
To where

2012
03:10:09,980 --> 03:10:13,580
I'm in a bit too heavy in this suit to be doing anything of that accord

2013
03:10:16,220 --> 03:10:20,460
I'm currently dying from laughter. Well because i'm raging at this game

2014
03:10:20,780 --> 03:10:22,780
No, he's giving up

2015
03:10:28,220 --> 03:10:30,220
I'm gonna artwork

2016
03:10:37,260 --> 03:10:39,420
I don't want to ruin it but I think you need to save them

2017
03:10:39,740 --> 03:10:44,700
I don't have the resources to save them. I genuinely don't and i've already missed some anyway

2018
03:10:44,780 --> 03:10:47,740
And i'm like i'm not going back so i'm not but

2019
03:10:48,700 --> 03:10:54,380
If I get the pissy pissy shitey shitey ending because i'm a pissy pissy shitey shitey player then that's on me

2020
03:10:54,540 --> 03:10:56,540
Sorry, but it's not your fault

2021
03:10:57,260 --> 03:11:02,860
I'm going to fucking the place is going are you joking the place is literally going down and i'm your fucking concern

2022
03:11:05,820 --> 03:11:10,140
I don't care the place is going down and i am somehow your concern

2023
03:11:11,420 --> 03:11:14,860
That doesn't make any sense. Get out. It's me. I'm literally being body blocked

2024
03:11:18,700 --> 03:11:23,500
The place is coming down and is that gonna hurt if I stand on it? I don't know probably

2025
03:11:25,980 --> 03:11:27,980
Search for loot

2026
03:11:37,180 --> 03:11:41,580
Well, I can breathe under water so i'm not really sure what the problem is here because none of them can

2027
03:11:42,220 --> 03:11:45,900
Look delta it is the world for which you strive

2028
03:11:48,140 --> 03:11:50,140
Alone among the dead

2029
03:11:51,580 --> 03:11:55,180
Hey, no, I just want my wane and then to go. Thanks. That's literally what I want

2030
03:11:55,260 --> 03:11:57,500
I don't know what you're smoking lamb, but I ain't whatever

2031
03:11:58,140 --> 03:12:04,620
Like see can the game just be can I just flood the entire place? So this is the gameplay that would be fantastic not gonna lie

2032
03:12:07,980 --> 03:12:09,980
What are you you're a little voice clip

2033
03:12:10,700 --> 03:12:12,700

Yes, our word is is that a problem

2040
03:13:02,700 --> 03:13:04,700
Where's me?

2041
03:13:06,140 --> 03:13:11,580
I had such a good experience in bio shock one. I don't remember struggling so hard

2042
03:13:14,780 --> 03:13:19,420
I just this just feels like resource management and i'm like this is a rooty-tooty shooty game

2043
03:13:19,500 --> 03:13:24,220
Please stop making me have to like stop every two seconds to access a machine to scavenge

2044
03:13:24,300 --> 03:13:30,300
Like i'm constantly doing this picking up stuff from bodies like bro. Let me root and shoot and shoot and keep going

2045
03:13:32,380 --> 03:13:36,780
Oh, no, they're busy. Oh, no, it's wrong. We don't fit it. I'll for you

2046
03:13:38,780 --> 03:13:40,780
I'll eat you

2047
03:13:42,940 --> 03:13:49,100
Rendezvous I've been in this place before higher on the streets and I said i'm a time to go

2048
03:13:53,020 --> 03:13:56,620
Whose footsteps for those they weren't mine. I heard someone's first time

2049
03:13:57,660 --> 03:13:59,660
You call that let me in

2050
03:14:02,220 --> 03:14:04,220
Just hack the machines and buy full packed

2051
03:14:06,460 --> 03:14:14,060
Am I against an invisible enemy now? Don't piss me off anymore than i'm already pissed off. Am I going against an invisible enemy?

2052
03:14:15,180 --> 03:14:17,980
That I can only tell from the freaking footsteps

2053
03:14:28,700 --> 03:14:31,740
Okay hack and then we'll go for the blue one

2054
03:14:33,180 --> 03:14:40,220
Is that free i think it was free now pick it up

2055
03:14:42,700 --> 03:14:49,100
Okay, now that i've hacked everything i'm going to buy all the animals actually we'll do full health first

2056
03:14:49,980 --> 03:14:51,980
I'm gonna do animals

2057
03:14:52,780 --> 03:14:56,620
I literally don't have enough and i've gotten achievement for something. I don't know what it is

2058
03:14:58,860 --> 03:15:00,860
I don't know what the code is. Yeah

2059
03:15:02,940 --> 03:15:08,300
I'm about to get shagged by something. I can't you see be honest

2060
03:15:17,580 --> 03:15:22,220
I hocus pocus there's a pizza on your focus meat piece of ghost

2061
03:15:23,100 --> 03:15:25,100
Oh

2062
03:15:30,620 --> 03:15:33,740
Don't do that again. Do you understand?

2063
03:15:43,260 --> 03:15:45,260
Which i saw in the pc

2064
03:15:45,820 --> 03:15:47,820
I'm just playing keyboard

2065
03:15:48,780 --> 03:15:50,780
Uh controller because I suck

2066
03:15:52,300 --> 03:15:57,820
Oh my god, i'm feeling a pizza. I don't know about you, but i'm feeling a pizza. This is gonna be my reward

2067
03:15:59,980 --> 03:16:04,140
I have to step away for a bit. So sorry if i'm repeating up. No, no you're fine

2068
03:16:04,140 --> 03:16:08,860
But one of the best ways to make this game easier is to take tons of pictures of different

2069
03:16:08,860 --> 03:16:11,340
Is it not just one and done buffs against them?

2070
03:16:11,340 --> 03:16:13,340
I

2071
03:16:17,260 --> 03:16:19,260
Got like an a plus for that

2072
03:16:20,140 --> 03:16:24,540
I have thank you sash power. I thought it was like one photo and then you're done. So

2073
03:16:25,900 --> 03:16:27,900
Right, I'll take more photos

2074
03:16:37,900 --> 03:16:39,900
What the music's so creepy I don't know

2075
03:16:42,060 --> 03:16:44,060
No, there are several levels

2076
03:16:53,820 --> 03:16:58,060
He's ready he wants a cup of tea i'm making

2077
03:17:02,060 --> 03:17:04,300
Then what because i've not frozen them

2078
03:17:04,300 --> 03:17:06,300
I want you to take me

2079
03:17:10,700 --> 03:17:11,900
I don't

2080
03:17:11,900 --> 03:17:15,260
The fox it why did you take that at least be so full right now

2081
03:17:18,460 --> 03:17:20,460
You brought this on yourself

2082
03:17:24,860 --> 03:17:30,700
Yes, uh stoney tea time. So if I hack it I get a heal for free, right

2083
03:17:31,020 --> 03:17:35,020
This place is very

2084
03:17:38,860 --> 03:17:41,260
Oh, is he fighting a big daddy?

2085
03:17:44,860 --> 03:17:48,140
Well the good news is i've located a new train car

2086
03:17:48,700 --> 03:17:54,780
But the station's still locked down and we're not alone in here. I see a shadow in the security booth

2087
03:17:55,340 --> 03:17:57,660
I'll lay low while you have a gander

2088
03:17:58,220 --> 03:18:00,220
Oh

2089
03:18:00,220 --> 03:18:03,180
I don't see a shadow. I see a smoking gun

2090
03:18:04,460 --> 03:18:11,100
Well, hello boys the name stan pool. What's your tribute quality paper?

2091
03:18:11,740 --> 03:18:16,140
Before the locals stopped reading and started finding other uses for it

2092
03:18:16,700 --> 03:18:22,540
Anyway, i'm going to cut a deal fellas come by the train station. I'm here in the booth

2093
03:18:28,460 --> 03:18:30,460
I need to take a photo

2094
03:18:38,700 --> 03:18:40,700
Wait, so I just keep going for it

2095
03:18:48,460 --> 03:18:51,500
I'm like am I making snuff films right now

2096
03:18:51,820 --> 03:18:58,860
I feel like I'm making snuff films right now. I'm not sure I'm supposed to be doing that

2097
03:19:04,380 --> 03:19:06,380
Uh

2098
03:19:06,940 --> 03:19:08,940
Now you're playing with power. Hello

2099
03:19:12,940 --> 03:19:14,940
You're making research

2100
03:19:21,500 --> 03:19:26,540
You drained out the park the little sisters are already starting through uh, no goes around

2101
03:19:28,860 --> 03:19:32,380
So does it matter how I kill them? Can I just kill them the same method or?

2102
03:19:33,740 --> 03:19:35,740
I can't have that

2103
03:19:37,660 --> 03:19:39,660
Like

2104
03:19:39,660 --> 03:19:41,660
I need to switch it up like

2105
03:19:46,060 --> 03:19:49,340
I don't know I don't know. Why are you oh upgrade station?

2106
03:19:50,300 --> 03:19:52,300
Um

2107
03:19:53,180 --> 03:19:56,060
Let me know we can make money for veal or other ways

2108
03:19:57,500 --> 03:20:02,380
See it as a part you're a hundred percent making snuff films literally like hold on a minute. What's going on here?

2109
03:20:03,180 --> 03:20:05,980
All right, we know how to kill them even better and I was like this is

2110
03:20:08,060 --> 03:20:10,060
Uh

2111
03:20:11,020 --> 03:20:13,020
The game awards you for being creative

2112
03:20:15,500 --> 03:20:17,500
All right, um

2113
03:20:17,900 --> 03:20:23,100
I'm just going for damage on everything because I don't know what I'm going to have ammo on and what I'm not

2114
03:20:23,100 --> 03:20:26,700
Going to how much money only up 45 dollars. So that's not happening

2115
03:20:27,900 --> 03:20:29,900
We can hack this

2116
03:20:31,340 --> 03:20:33,340
That's kind of

2117
03:20:39,660 --> 03:20:41,900
We did it we hacked things

2118
03:20:42,780 --> 03:20:44,780
Okay

2119
03:20:45,900 --> 03:20:47,900
Let's progress hello

2120
03:20:48,460 --> 03:20:50,460
Sorry, you don't feel so well, but I hope you're resting

2121
03:20:51,260 --> 03:20:52,860
and generally says

2122
03:20:52,860 --> 03:20:54,860
You what the enemies are weakest again

2123
03:20:56,460 --> 03:20:58,940
Why I don't know how I did that time. Wait, hold on

2124
03:21:00,300 --> 03:21:02,300
Okay, snuff film time

2125
03:21:03,980 --> 03:21:05,980
I got an e for that

2126
03:21:07,260 --> 03:21:09,260
Oh

2127
03:21:09,660 --> 03:21:13,420
Yeah, like they're dropping me five bullets per lake gun. I'm picking up like that

2128
03:21:24,780 --> 03:21:29,980
Why have you given me? How have you gifted me a launcher? I'm just a big daddy with a launcher

2129
03:21:33,820 --> 03:21:35,820
Should you trust me with this

2130
03:21:36,780 --> 03:21:40,220
I think I'm going to take it off until we have a fate to use it on

2131
03:21:41,260 --> 03:21:45,020
I'm not sure you should trust me with something like this. I have a terrible track record of

2132
03:22:06,300 --> 03:22:08,300
Are you trolling?

2133
03:22:09,500 --> 03:22:11,500
I mess up one

2134
03:22:12,940 --> 03:22:14,940
And the thing hates me

2135
03:22:17,900 --> 03:22:19,900
Right, I get to keep on at least

2136
03:22:27,180 --> 03:22:31,180
Wait, they send an even more wherever lags

2137
03:22:31,180 --> 03:22:33,180
Oh

2138
03:22:34,460 --> 03:22:38,780
I messed up wait am I taking health damage when I mess up?

2139
03:22:44,060 --> 03:22:46,780
Am I am I gonna mental what's going on?

2140
03:22:48,460 --> 03:22:50,460
I'm gonna weave it mental

2141
03:22:50,780 --> 03:22:53,260
Did they like leave me alone after I messed up?

2142
03:22:55,020 --> 03:22:57,900
That just makes me like never want to hack anything

2143
03:22:58,780 --> 03:23:05,180
If the if the result of messing up a hack is like oh a billion enemies come flying at you that literally just discards

2144
03:23:06,060 --> 03:23:09,820
Look, okay. Okay. You're gonna have to be nice to me. Oh, hello

2145
03:23:11,580 --> 03:23:17,820
Okay, so dead men tell no tales, right? Right wrong. See with anime

2146
03:23:18,700 --> 03:23:22,700
Every stiff's got a story and lamb knows how to read it

2147
03:23:23,420 --> 03:23:25,420
If that stuff makes it back to her

2148
03:23:25,740 --> 03:23:32,540
I'm an obituary. So I want you to take the story of Dionysus park and bury it

2149
03:23:33,260 --> 03:23:36,620
Get rid of the little sisters for me your way

2150
03:23:37,420 --> 03:23:42,220
Do that and I'll unlock the station here scouts honor

2151
03:23:44,860 --> 03:23:51,020
Why are you scared of a little sister? I'd say he's hiding something but he sort of took the fun out of that one

2152
03:23:51,500 --> 03:23:57,180
He's locked in the security booth. However, so we'll have to play along find those sisters

2153
03:23:59,420 --> 03:24:02,700
Oh, he doesn't want to do something to the sisters does he?

2154
03:24:08,780 --> 03:24:10,780
The bumblebee just falls

2155
03:24:12,220 --> 03:24:14,220
Check your map

2156
03:24:14,300 --> 03:24:16,300
Oh

2157
03:24:16,780 --> 03:24:20,860
There's one up ahead to the left and then one straight ahead

2158
03:24:24,540 --> 03:24:26,540
Okay, this way and then to the left

2159
03:24:31,180 --> 03:24:33,180
Moe bumblebees have already perished

2160
03:24:35,180 --> 03:24:39,340
The little sisters are I'm gonna go rest well. Thank you for hanging

2161
03:24:40,540 --> 03:24:42,540
Sorry about the non MLG gameplay

2162
03:24:43,500 --> 03:24:47,180
Oh, this looks like a battle fucking arena if I've ever seen one you do

2163
03:24:47,980 --> 03:24:51,660
Okay, a little to the left. There should be a sister down here. Yes, there is

2164
03:24:57,740 --> 03:25:07,980
I think I'm a bit too loud to be making noises. Oh, that's my friend. Oh, we're getting bombed. That's okay. I didn't want to live anyway

2165
03:25:12,940 --> 03:25:14,940
Are you squishing me right now?

2166
03:25:15,900 --> 03:25:22,700
The tricky part about photos is that you can't take infinite photos of the same men and weper fight due to diminishing returns

2167
03:25:23,260 --> 03:25:25,660
You need to take photos on them each fight

2168
03:25:26,140 --> 03:25:29,900
Also, I think photos on robots makes them easier to hack

2169
03:25:30,540 --> 03:25:32,540
Okay

2170
03:25:33,100 --> 03:25:35,600
So does the game just want me to have everything?

2171
03:25:43,420 --> 03:25:44,540
I

2172
03:25:44,540 --> 03:25:48,860
Shouldn't be cacking so stressful. They wanted me to have a good time should have thought like that

2173
03:25:51,180 --> 03:25:54,220
Like even hacked this is expensive

2174
03:25:59,500 --> 03:26:05,340
I don't need drill fuel because I don't really use that so much. I ain't paid to have more hacked art

2175
03:26:07,340 --> 03:26:09,980
Bleeding me fucking dry, honestly

2176
03:26:13,180 --> 03:26:15,180
Oh

2177
03:26:29,820 --> 03:26:31,820
No more giving me money for game advice because

2178
03:26:32,940 --> 03:26:37,660
I just suck in general anyway. I don't know what way I'm going for it. Well, what are you doing this way?

2179
03:26:38,860 --> 03:26:40,860
Stand this way

2180
03:26:41,660 --> 03:26:45,980
Keep your money's keep your money's don't don't give me money's for game advice

2181
03:26:47,020 --> 03:26:51,900
I know just repeat if someone if someone puts a really good thing and everyone just spam it at the same time

2182
03:26:51,900 --> 03:26:56,380
Just copy and paste. Okay, because don't don't give me money's for reading shit a video game

2183
03:26:58,380 --> 03:26:59,980
There she is

2184
03:26:59,980 --> 03:27:01,980
Little tyke wants to be in pictures

2185
03:27:02,780 --> 03:27:06,860
Real cute now get rid of the muscle and deal with her

2186
03:27:06,860 --> 03:27:08,860
I

2187
03:27:09,420 --> 03:27:14,700
Am right you want to get out of the way for this because you're not gonna you're gonna like what happens next

2188
03:27:37,340 --> 03:27:39,340
Okay

2189
03:27:39,500 --> 03:27:44,780
All right, sorry pumpkin up you come you're fine. You're gonna get released and all that jazz

2190
03:27:45,900 --> 03:27:48,620
Bumblebee it literally bumblebee took all the hit time on me

2191
03:27:49,260 --> 03:27:53,020
See you put it at work and all that adam ends up in you

2192
03:27:53,740 --> 03:27:58,220
But you're sort of a silent partner. So that's tops with me

2193
03:28:07,820 --> 03:28:09,820
I can hear that enemy

2194
03:28:13,180 --> 03:28:15,900
Please be safe. Please be safe. Please be safe

2195
03:28:36,860 --> 03:28:39,820
I

2196
03:29:07,260 --> 03:29:09,260
Oh my god

2197
03:29:10,940 --> 03:29:12,940
Yeah

2198
03:29:14,060 --> 03:29:16,060
Who is me?

2199
03:29:18,700 --> 03:29:24,380
Oh my god, see I can't handle these fights. We are gonna finish it tomorrow

2200
03:29:25,340 --> 03:29:32,460
But if you see me like with fucking unlimited ammo, please don't judge me or like unlimited med kits or some shit

2201
03:29:32,860 --> 03:29:34,620
this is like

2202
03:29:34,620 --> 03:29:38,780
No, fucking easy-peasy, but we'll at least explore this for supplies, but

2203
03:29:45,900 --> 03:29:47,900
Evade cameras more easily there's

2204
03:29:55,580 --> 03:29:59,340
This spawn and continuously when harvest them as long as you're just having fun

2205
03:29:59,580 --> 03:30:02,540
Like I said, I really want to get to the bottom of the pot. I like this

2206
03:30:03,020 --> 03:30:05,020
Oh

2207
03:30:05,420 --> 03:30:07,420
So when you see me pop up with infinite health tomorrow

2208
03:30:14,140 --> 03:30:20,220
I will judge so hard judge will you want sorry, but when a game says easy mode, I expect to not be like fucking resource managing

2209
03:30:22,060 --> 03:30:24,060
controversial take

2210
03:30:33,260 --> 03:30:35,260
Oh

2211
03:30:36,860 --> 03:30:40,460
So fucking controversial easy mode should be easy

2212
03:30:47,420 --> 03:30:49,420
Projectile vomit

2213
03:30:52,540 --> 03:30:58,860
Oh that redini splicers winning because I don't know which one I didn't even have fun here

2214
03:31:03,420 --> 03:31:05,420
I

2215
03:31:07,100 --> 03:31:09,100
Me currently recording my

2216
03:31:09,900 --> 03:31:11,900
elite gameplay

2217
03:31:12,220 --> 03:31:14,220

2218
03:31:14,540 --> 03:31:17,980
Where that yeah, I'm surprised I never going in for that. Hey, can we

2219
03:31:18,860 --> 03:31:20,860
Hack only to hack again the flies

2220
03:31:23,580 --> 03:31:25,580
Why am I drunk?

2221
03:31:26,300 --> 03:31:28,300
I

2222
03:31:35,340 --> 03:31:42,220
I'm fucking steaming apparently how many enemies do you see more than enough?

2223
03:31:49,660 --> 03:31:51,660
I hear a daddy

2224
03:31:55,660 --> 03:31:57,660
She's so good at hacking

2225
03:31:58,220 --> 03:32:02,220
I can hear a daddy, but I've not pissed them off ever. I can't even have them

2226
03:32:04,300 --> 03:32:06,300
So what take a left?

2227
03:32:10,940 --> 03:32:13,340
Oh wait, if I still got a win on my back. Oh, I do

2228
03:32:17,580 --> 03:32:20,780
Sorry, oh my god, I have to do two adam run

2229
03:32:20,780 --> 03:32:22,620
I

2230
03:32:23,180 --> 03:32:25,180
Of you Beach

2231
03:32:48,460 --> 03:32:50,300
Speeder

2232
03:32:50,780 --> 03:32:58,780
Oh, I'm sure this isn't going to go bad at all.

2233
03:32:58,780 --> 03:33:03,780
Oh my god, stop respawning, seriously.

2234
03:33:03,780 --> 03:33:05,780
Alright, have fun.

2235
03:33:05,780 --> 03:33:07,780
Hopefully I won't get you killed.

2236
03:33:07,780 --> 03:33:09,780
Oh, I'm already dead.

2237
03:33:09,780 --> 03:33:12,780
Oh wait, hold on.

2238
03:33:12,780 --> 03:33:17,780
Splacer, increase movement speed.

2239
03:33:18,780 --> 03:33:29,780
That would be helpful if I had any bullets.

2240
03:33:29,780 --> 03:33:40,780
Sorry, there's loads of noises coming in.

2241
03:33:40,780 --> 03:33:44,780
Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.

2242
03:33:44,780 --> 03:33:49,780
This slow-mo's, I'm getting annihilated.

2243
03:33:49,780 --> 03:34:02,780
Oh no, that's even worse.

2244
03:34:02,780 --> 03:34:07,780
Did you see that?

2245
03:34:07,780 --> 03:34:10,780
Oh, that was awful.

2246
03:34:10,780 --> 03:34:12,780
Oh my god, right, Angel's all gone.

2247
03:34:12,780 --> 03:34:17,780
Oh, that was horrific.

2248
03:34:17,780 --> 03:34:20,780
Oh, I did not like that.

2249
03:34:20,780 --> 03:34:22,780
I didn't like it either, darling.

2250
03:34:22,780 --> 03:34:24,780
That was freaky.

2251
03:34:24,780 --> 03:34:28,780
Little pumpkin pie.

2252
03:34:28,780 --> 03:34:32,780
And you won't get away with it.

2253
03:34:32,780 --> 03:34:34,780
Oops, let's see what's wrong there.

2254
03:34:34,780 --> 03:34:36,780
This is definitely the wrong way.

2255
03:34:36,780 --> 03:34:41,780
I'm not to go upstairs at all right now.

2256
03:34:41,780 --> 03:34:46,780
That's why they're called spider slayzers.

2257
03:34:46,780 --> 03:34:49,780
How is it that it goes so far into the game?

2258
03:34:49,780 --> 03:34:51,780
I'm not found that yet.

2259
03:34:51,780 --> 03:34:56,780
Right, that's just ammunition.

2260
03:34:56,780 --> 03:34:59,780
Damn, you got punished hardcore.

2261
03:34:59,780 --> 03:35:01,780
Wait, what was that?

2262
03:35:01,780 --> 03:35:03,780
No, I can't, scavenge format.

2263
03:35:03,780 --> 03:35:06,780
Reefling's crawling on the roof.

2264
03:35:06,780 --> 03:35:10,780
Okay, you go in there, darling.

2265
03:35:10,780 --> 03:35:14,780
See you later alligator, you've done great.

2266
03:35:14,780 --> 03:35:16,780
Thanks for blinding me on the way out.

2267
03:35:16,780 --> 03:35:21,780
No, that's fine, I really enjoyed that.

2268
03:35:21,780 --> 03:35:27,780
Father, this atom you found contains memories from all the bodies here.

2269
03:35:27,780 --> 03:35:30,780
Normally, only a little sister can see them,

2270
03:35:30,780 --> 03:35:33,780
but I can show you what Stanley is trying to hide.

2271
03:35:33,780 --> 03:35:34,780
Yeah?

2272
03:35:34,780 --> 03:35:39,780
When mother was taken away, Stanley was left in charge of Dionysus Park.

2273
03:35:39,780 --> 03:35:43,780
She spent all her money through these mad parties.

2274
03:35:43,780 --> 03:35:47,780
It was like he was trying to ruin her.

2275
03:35:51,780 --> 03:35:53,780
You okay there?

2276
03:35:53,780 --> 03:35:55,780
Keep your eye on the brass ring, brother.

2277
03:35:55,780 --> 03:35:59,780
Find the rest of the sisters.

2278
03:35:59,780 --> 03:36:03,780
Right, need to make sure she's safe.

2279
03:36:03,780 --> 03:36:05,780
Come on, you can do it.

2280
03:36:05,780 --> 03:36:07,780
Use that upper body strength.

2281
03:36:08,780 --> 03:36:10,780
Let's progress.

2282
03:36:14,780 --> 03:36:17,780
By going a little to the right, bing.

2283
03:36:17,780 --> 03:36:19,780
Yo!

2284
03:36:19,780 --> 03:36:22,780
Oh, that didn't kill him?

2285
03:36:31,780 --> 03:36:33,780
My name's Johnny.

2286
03:36:37,780 --> 03:36:41,780
Did he just reveal lore?

2287
03:36:50,780 --> 03:36:53,780
Let me hack this.

2288
03:36:53,780 --> 03:36:57,780
Bonk, bonk, bonk, bonk.

2289
03:37:00,780 --> 03:37:04,780
My name's Johnny.

2290
03:37:05,780 --> 03:37:07,780
Hmm.

2291
03:37:09,780 --> 03:37:12,780
I think we may need to just...

2292
03:37:22,780 --> 03:37:25,780
I'm kinda at the mercy of what the game be offering me.

2293
03:37:25,780 --> 03:37:30,780
Jimmy Beezer, Johnny Coles, what's next?

2294
03:37:30,780 --> 03:37:33,780
JC, what's JC?

2295
03:37:33,780 --> 03:37:35,780
JC.

2296
03:37:37,780 --> 03:37:39,780
The promenade.

2297
03:37:45,780 --> 03:37:47,780
I'm gonna pick this up first.

2298
03:37:47,780 --> 03:37:50,780
Oh, let me be selfish.

2299
03:38:04,780 --> 03:38:07,780
Increase damage!

2300
03:38:07,780 --> 03:38:10,780
Fuck yeah, that's literally all I want.

2301
03:38:10,780 --> 03:38:13,780
Right, okay, I'm literally Photoshopping everyone.

2302
03:38:13,780 --> 03:38:19,780
I will create an AI video right now of me annihilating these forces.

2303
03:38:23,780 --> 03:38:25,780
Is this...?

2304
03:38:25,780 --> 03:38:27,780
Is this...?

2305
03:38:27,780 --> 03:38:29,780
Why?

2306
03:38:33,780 --> 03:38:36,780
This is terrible.

2307
03:38:37,780 --> 03:38:41,780
I'm getting a Bravo, I guess because I've already done it before.

2308
03:38:43,780 --> 03:38:45,780
What's this, a carousel?

2309
03:38:45,780 --> 03:38:47,780
Right, we've already been here.

2310
03:38:47,780 --> 03:38:50,780
Wait, so what way to do it? What was this, though?

2311
03:38:50,780 --> 03:38:52,780
No, she is done this way. Okay.

2312
03:38:52,780 --> 03:38:54,780
She can prompt.

2313
03:38:54,780 --> 03:38:59,780
The game overs get pretty nasty, too.

2314
03:38:59,780 --> 03:39:03,780
Game overs? Like, if I die? Or did I miss on this one?

2315
03:39:04,780 --> 03:39:06,780
Your next bitch.

2316
03:39:06,780 --> 03:39:08,780
Yeah, yeah, yeah, you can't...

2317
03:39:08,780 --> 03:39:12,780
What in the... What in the purple ink was that?

2318
03:39:13,780 --> 03:39:16,780
Actually, I'm probably better with this one.

2319
03:39:18,780 --> 03:39:20,780
Oh, have I... Have you...

2320
03:39:26,780 --> 03:39:28,780
It's not fell time!

2321
03:39:30,780 --> 03:39:32,780
Okay.

2322
03:39:34,780 --> 03:39:36,780
Bunk!

2323
03:39:36,780 --> 03:39:38,780
I got an A for that.

2324
03:39:38,780 --> 03:39:40,780
Well, because I did multiple things.

2325
03:39:40,780 --> 03:39:42,780
Oh, I don't have incinerate.

2326
03:39:45,780 --> 03:39:48,780
I assume that's where I'm supposed to go.

2327
03:39:50,780 --> 03:39:52,780
The knife, well, that's the shortcut.

2328
03:39:52,780 --> 03:39:54,780
No, it just seems like a dead end.

2329
03:39:59,780 --> 03:40:01,780
Come on, man.

2330
03:40:02,780 --> 03:40:04,780
There she is.

2331
03:40:06,780 --> 03:40:09,780
I hope that bodyguard ain't one of your long losts.

2332
03:40:09,780 --> 03:40:12,780
My long losts? Wait, are these all my buddies?

2333
03:40:17,780 --> 03:40:20,780
Primer didn't 15 increase the dill damage.

2334
03:40:20,780 --> 03:40:22,780
The dill?

2335
03:40:23,780 --> 03:40:28,780
Oh, my game broke.

2336
03:40:28,780 --> 03:40:31,780
No, I just glitched out. Sorry.

2337
03:40:35,780 --> 03:40:37,780
Bruh, relax!

2338
03:40:38,780 --> 03:40:41,780
Fuckin' tube, I was complete that game, you bum.

2339
03:40:47,780 --> 03:40:50,780
Is that... Can I do the picture thing again?

2340
03:40:50,780 --> 03:40:52,780
Okay, I just need to deny that.

2341
03:40:52,780 --> 03:40:54,780
Oh, no, sorry, there's something going on.

2342
03:40:58,780 --> 03:41:00,780
Something is...

2343
03:41:00,780 --> 03:41:02,780
Motherfucker!

2344
03:41:20,780 --> 03:41:22,780
Oh, my God.

2345
03:41:32,780 --> 03:41:34,780
Up you come.

2346
03:41:34,780 --> 03:41:37,780
Up to popsy, you're fine, you're fine, it's fine, you're fine.

2347
03:41:37,780 --> 03:41:39,780
Don't worry about it.

2348
03:41:39,780 --> 03:41:41,780
Not dill drill.

2349
03:41:41,780 --> 03:41:43,780
Wait, did I say dill?

2350
03:41:43,780 --> 03:41:45,780
Dill damage? Sorry.

2351
03:41:45,780 --> 03:41:48,780
I'm already thinking about what happens next, you know what I'm saying?

2352
03:41:48,780 --> 03:41:50,780
After this, where...

2353
03:41:50,780 --> 03:41:54,780
Oh, there's a dead body right behind me that she wants to harvest.

2354
03:41:59,780 --> 03:42:01,780
Okay, okay.

2355
03:42:01,780 --> 03:42:04,780
Don't give me anything difficult now, if you're a little healed again.

2356
03:42:06,780 --> 03:42:08,780
Don't give me anything difficult.

2357
03:42:10,780 --> 03:42:12,780
I need something long range for this room.

2358
03:42:19,780 --> 03:42:21,780
Sorry, I'm getting...

2359
03:42:30,780 --> 03:42:32,780
Stop, you're so creepy!

2360
03:42:35,780 --> 03:42:37,780
They hurt alone!

2361
03:42:42,780 --> 03:42:45,780
I did like the gameplay of actually being the big daddy, though.

2362
03:42:48,780 --> 03:42:50,780
Okay.

2363
03:42:55,780 --> 03:42:57,780
Ah, I'm done up.

2364
03:43:06,780 --> 03:43:08,780
Ah, right, you...

2365
03:43:09,780 --> 03:43:11,780
Yes, you're going home very soon.

2366
03:43:12,780 --> 03:43:14,780
I'm not!

2367
03:43:14,780 --> 03:43:17,780
If anything, I'm the one that's getting got here.

2368
03:43:17,780 --> 03:43:20,780
I literally cannot keep up with these fights.

2369
03:43:21,780 --> 03:43:23,780
Get riveted, get riveted, get riveted.

2370
03:43:23,780 --> 03:43:26,780
Honestly, I've like put my damage up and everything.

2371
03:43:28,780 --> 03:43:31,780
Oh, I'm trying to scavenge everything I can.

2372
03:43:31,780 --> 03:43:34,780
That's why you know that noise you hear that goes do do do do do do.

2373
03:43:34,780 --> 03:43:36,780
That's literally me trying to scavenge everything in one go.

2374
03:43:36,780 --> 03:43:42,780
Right, apparently the other dead body is in this room up here.

2375
03:43:43,780 --> 03:43:45,780
If she won't...

2376
03:43:48,780 --> 03:43:49,780
I have one health.

2377
03:43:49,780 --> 03:43:52,780
I don't think I've got the freaking thing for this.

2378
03:43:52,780 --> 03:43:54,780
That ammo.

2379
03:43:55,780 --> 03:43:57,780
I need a bit better than that.

2380
03:43:57,780 --> 03:43:58,780
There's a healing session up there.

2381
03:43:58,780 --> 03:44:01,780
I think I'm going to have to go for it before I do this fight, please.

2382
03:44:02,780 --> 03:44:04,780
This is...

2383
03:44:04,780 --> 03:44:06,780
She's not looking good for me, mate.

2384
03:44:06,780 --> 03:44:07,780
She's not looking good for me.

2385
03:44:07,780 --> 03:44:09,780
I think that's pretty yank.

2386
03:44:09,780 --> 03:44:10,780
What about you?

2387
03:44:10,780 --> 03:44:13,780
Oh, you're just health and nothing more?

2388
03:44:19,780 --> 03:44:21,780
Oh, no, I'll hack it and all that.

2389
03:44:24,780 --> 03:44:26,780
Don't tingling me.

2390
03:44:27,780 --> 03:44:33,780
Get a blue bonus while hacking for a friendly fucking thing or whatever.

2391
03:44:33,780 --> 03:44:36,780
I'm working on it, I'm working on it.

2392
03:44:37,780 --> 03:44:39,780
Ooh, what are you?

2393
03:44:39,780 --> 03:44:45,780
Who needs guns when you've got a drill and nearly unlimited plasmid power?

2394
03:44:46,780 --> 03:44:49,780
What? What's that?

2395
03:44:49,780 --> 03:44:51,780
That doesn't tell me what it is though.

2396
03:44:55,780 --> 03:44:57,780
I won't put it on the new equipment camera.

2397
03:44:57,780 --> 03:45:01,780
Right, because that bot is on my side, I think we're just going to have to send it.

2398
03:45:04,780 --> 03:45:06,780
Just fucking hack it.

2399
03:45:10,780 --> 03:45:11,780
I can't achieve anything for that.

2400
03:45:11,780 --> 03:45:13,780
Wait, that doesn't give me...

2401
03:45:13,780 --> 03:45:16,780
Oh, I thought it would give me a med kit.

2402
03:45:16,780 --> 03:45:18,780
Right, off you pop, darling, good luck.

2403
03:45:18,780 --> 03:45:22,780
Either we die here or we don't, because I can't keep up with this.

2404
03:45:25,780 --> 03:45:29,780
I literally can't keep up with these fights with the little sisters.

2405
03:45:29,780 --> 03:45:31,780
I'm sorry, but it's getting too...

2406
03:45:33,780 --> 03:45:36,780
It's actually getting so difficult for me really.

2407
03:45:39,780 --> 03:45:41,780
Ah!

2408
03:45:48,780 --> 03:45:50,780
The snuff films are shaped!

2409
03:45:52,780 --> 03:45:54,780
Okay, hold on, let's do a freeze.

2410
03:45:54,780 --> 03:45:56,780
Maybe the snuff films might enjoy that a bit more.

2411
03:46:10,780 --> 03:46:12,780
What?

2412
03:46:18,780 --> 03:46:19,780
It's too much.

2413
03:46:19,780 --> 03:46:20,780
I have no heals.

2414
03:46:21,780 --> 03:46:22,780
Are you done?

2415
03:46:23,780 --> 03:46:25,780
Okay, get the fuck on board.

2416
03:46:28,780 --> 03:46:31,780
Yes, you do have the best adding, so please don't let me die.

2417
03:46:32,780 --> 03:46:35,780
It's up to you if I perish, seriously, heal me.

2418
03:46:36,780 --> 03:46:39,780
Wait, it still costs me money to heal?

2419
03:46:40,780 --> 03:46:42,780
I can't believe she's gotten this far in Legendary Mode.

2420
03:46:42,780 --> 03:46:45,780
Thank you, Reefling, I have, I've gotten so far.

2421
03:46:46,780 --> 03:46:49,780
I'm just fucking trying to scavenge anything.

2422
03:46:49,780 --> 03:46:51,780
But you know what, I'd really like to scavenge, not ammo.

2423
03:46:51,780 --> 03:46:54,780
I would actually really like to scavenge.

2424
03:46:55,780 --> 03:46:57,780
Right, you go home.

2425
03:46:58,780 --> 03:47:00,780
Yep, all done, right, off you pop, and you go...

2426
03:47:00,780 --> 03:47:03,780
See you later, alligator, and a wild crocodile.

2427
03:47:05,780 --> 03:47:08,780
I don't want to unlock more passive ability floats.

2428
03:47:09,780 --> 03:47:11,780
Right, off you pop.

2429
03:47:11,780 --> 03:47:13,780
That's me there.

2430
03:47:13,780 --> 03:47:15,780
I confronted Stanley.

2431
03:47:15,780 --> 03:47:17,780
Said I'd tell mother what he had done.

2432
03:47:17,780 --> 03:47:21,780
He panicked, took me away, and sold me to an orphanage.

2433
03:47:22,780 --> 03:47:24,780
I tried to fight back.

2434
03:47:24,780 --> 03:47:26,780
I remember biting his hand, but...

2435
03:47:26,780 --> 03:47:32,780
Father, he's the reason I was turned into a little sister.

2436
03:47:33,780 --> 03:47:34,780
Uh-huh.

2437
03:47:36,780 --> 03:47:39,780
So what, I'm supposed to be filled with rage?

2438
03:47:39,780 --> 03:47:42,780
Right, I need to make sure she gets them safely.

2439
03:47:43,780 --> 03:47:46,780
I'm patrolling, don't you worry, darling, I got ya.

2440
03:47:47,780 --> 03:47:50,780
Make sure she's okay, right, she's okay.

2441
03:47:50,780 --> 03:47:51,780
At least one.

2442
03:47:52,780 --> 03:47:54,780
What, is there something in this room?

2443
03:47:56,780 --> 03:47:59,780
It sounds like there's a big daddy in here, but...

2444
03:48:01,780 --> 03:48:05,780
Now, you were just a deep sea explorer with Iron Cajones, pal.

2445
03:48:05,780 --> 03:48:06,780
Cajones.

2446
03:48:07,780 --> 03:48:12,780
But Ryan was sure you were a spook, so his people locked you up.

2447
03:48:12,780 --> 03:48:15,780
Erased your damn name. Goodbye, Johnny.

2448
03:48:17,780 --> 03:48:20,780
Sorry, I know you're in the middle of a really important dialogue.

2449
03:48:20,780 --> 03:48:24,780
I am so fucking empty of anything right now.

2450
03:48:24,780 --> 03:48:26,780
I couldn't give less of a shit.

2451
03:48:27,780 --> 03:48:32,780
I couldn't give less of a shit.

2452
03:48:32,780 --> 03:48:34,780
So, what on Earth?

2453
03:48:34,780 --> 03:48:38,780
Increased damage, a Christmas fucking miracle.

2454
03:48:38,780 --> 03:48:43,780
In a single sublime mosaic, Eleanor.

2455
03:48:43,780 --> 03:48:48,780
Consider the genius you deny her with every stolen drop.

2456
03:49:00,780 --> 03:49:02,780
Does this feel like I'm crouching?

2457
03:49:08,780 --> 03:49:15,780
No fucking more.

2458
03:49:15,780 --> 03:49:17,780
Right, Jean Bank.

2459
03:49:17,780 --> 03:49:21,780
I assume this, yeah, this is one if I want to sort shit out, but I don't know.

2460
03:49:22,780 --> 03:49:23,780
I'm Pippa Pig.

2461
03:49:23,780 --> 03:49:26,780
Wait, why does that sound like I'm Pippa Pig?

2462
03:49:27,780 --> 03:49:28,780
Do that again.

2463
03:49:32,780 --> 03:49:33,780
I'm Pippa Pig.

2464
03:49:33,780 --> 03:49:42,780
That rocket launcher backfires so badly. It absolutely did.

2465
03:49:47,780 --> 03:49:48,780
Got a B for that.

2466
03:49:53,780 --> 03:49:54,780
New Jean Bank.

2467
03:50:03,780 --> 03:50:05,780
Got an E for that, not there.

2468
03:50:08,780 --> 03:50:09,780
Wait, you won't.

2469
03:50:14,780 --> 03:50:16,780
A bit of Merlot.

2470
03:50:28,780 --> 03:50:31,780
I'm a bit too steaming right now to be able to do this.

2471
03:50:32,780 --> 03:50:36,780
I'm just gonna let, okay, are you good?

2472
03:50:51,780 --> 03:50:54,780
How much of a tank is this gentleman?

2473
03:50:55,780 --> 03:50:59,780
You're okay, you're okay, it's fine, you're probably better in the hands of me than him.

2474
03:51:00,780 --> 03:51:01,780
Oh my gosh.

2475
03:51:04,780 --> 03:51:09,780
Finding a gathering garden, spend Adam opens up more slots for passive.

2476
03:51:09,780 --> 03:51:11,780
What the fuck is a gathering garden?

2477
03:51:12,780 --> 03:51:13,780
It says GG.

2478
03:51:13,780 --> 03:51:16,780
Oh, it was right out there, sorry, hold on.

2479
03:51:16,780 --> 03:51:19,780
There's a GG out here, let me go get it.

2480
03:51:23,780 --> 03:51:25,780
Ow, what the fuck?

2481
03:51:26,780 --> 03:51:30,780
That was actually really funny, sorry, that was really funny.

2482
03:51:30,780 --> 03:51:32,780
Okay, there's apparently a GG to my left.

2483
03:51:33,780 --> 03:51:39,780
Congratulations, you have found your first reward from the little ones for saving the little sisters.

2484
03:51:40,780 --> 03:51:41,780
A teddy bear.

2485
03:51:43,780 --> 03:51:48,780
A proud, get even more out of the time spent with your little sister.

2486
03:51:48,780 --> 03:51:51,780
Any little sister working for you will gather slightly more Adam.

2487
03:51:51,780 --> 03:51:53,780
Okay, that sounds good.

2488
03:51:53,780 --> 03:51:56,780
I don't, I forgot what Evelyn is, so whatever, I'll just...

2489
03:51:57,780 --> 03:51:58,780
Oh thanks, darling.

2490
03:51:58,780 --> 03:52:00,780
Right, Jean, upgrade.

2491
03:52:01,780 --> 03:52:03,780
Increase your maximum Eve, pyramids, look.

2492
03:52:04,780 --> 03:52:08,780
Plasmas gives, and unlock an additional pyramid.

2493
03:52:17,780 --> 03:52:20,780
Oh my god, there's so many, it keeps going.

2494
03:52:24,780 --> 03:52:26,780
You have 600.

2495
03:52:27,780 --> 03:52:33,780
And I would walk 600 Adams, and I would suck 600 Adams.

2496
03:52:34,780 --> 03:52:39,780
Just to be that big daddy that sucks on all your Adams.

2497
03:52:43,780 --> 03:52:46,780
If you're listening carefully, you can hear a brain developing wrinkle.

2498
03:52:47,780 --> 03:52:58,780
Uh, is it maximize, increase your maximum Eve, health upgrade, and then plasma swap.

2499
03:52:59,780 --> 03:53:02,780
Okay, empty swap.

2500
03:53:07,780 --> 03:53:08,780
Okay.

2501
03:53:11,780 --> 03:53:15,780
Is it gene tonic, additional gene, oh it's genes that I want.

2502
03:53:16,780 --> 03:53:17,780
Yeah.

2503
03:53:18,780 --> 03:53:20,780
How do I send them?

2504
03:53:25,780 --> 03:53:28,780
It seems to be automatically filling them, which I do appreciate.

2505
03:53:30,780 --> 03:53:34,780
Uh, health and Eve, electrical bolt too.

2506
03:53:34,780 --> 03:53:36,780
Yeah, that sounds good.

2507
03:53:37,780 --> 03:53:40,780
Yeah, electrical bolt too, sounds good.

2508
03:53:41,780 --> 03:53:42,780
New and improved.

2509
03:53:47,780 --> 03:53:48,780
Charge up.

2510
03:53:48,780 --> 03:53:50,780
Okay, charge up.

2511
03:53:50,780 --> 03:53:52,780
Charge, bitch.

2512
03:53:54,780 --> 03:53:57,780
Release the warmth of swingy insects that seek your enemies.

2513
03:53:58,780 --> 03:54:00,780
Defy spirit Eve.

2514
03:54:01,780 --> 03:54:06,780
Telekinesis boots on, drinking alcohol restores that.

2515
03:54:06,780 --> 03:54:08,780
Wait, alcohol takes away my Eve?

2516
03:54:08,780 --> 03:54:10,780
Is that why I have none?

2517
03:54:11,780 --> 03:54:15,780
Plasmas use glass Eve.

2518
03:54:17,780 --> 03:54:21,780
It just is all physical damage.

2519
03:54:21,780 --> 03:54:23,780
I think that's what I need.

2520
03:54:23,780 --> 03:54:25,780
Is that the passive?

2521
03:54:25,780 --> 03:54:28,780
Oh, it is the passive, put it in that one.

2522
03:54:28,780 --> 03:54:29,780
Okay.

2523
03:54:30,780 --> 03:54:33,780
Okay, and then give me more gene swap.

2524
03:54:34,780 --> 03:54:36,780
And then I'll buy something to put in it.

2525
03:54:38,780 --> 03:54:40,780
Drill lurker, quiet your footsteps.

2526
03:54:40,780 --> 03:54:43,780
You know, I'm not here trying to be a PC, PC, PC.

2527
03:54:43,780 --> 03:54:48,780
You take no damage from electricity, you deal more damage when you use electrical attacks.

2528
03:54:49,780 --> 03:54:54,780
I like that, that machine buster, increased damage against cameras, short circuit.

2529
03:54:55,780 --> 03:54:58,780
Every time you hack something, you gain a little health and Eve.

2530
03:54:59,780 --> 03:55:03,780
Reduce duration, you gain a little extra health.

2531
03:55:03,780 --> 03:55:07,780
Hacking success zone, headhunter, your headshot, nope.

2532
03:55:07,780 --> 03:55:14,780
You can carry more than a first aid kit, just one.

2533
03:55:15,780 --> 03:55:20,780
You take less damage from fire and inflict more damage when you use fire.

2534
03:55:21,780 --> 03:55:25,780
Health stations also refill your Eve.

2535
03:55:26,780 --> 03:55:30,780
Repair and name friendly bots and turrets.

2536
03:55:30,780 --> 03:55:33,780
Well, considering the bumblebees don't stay with me.

2537
03:55:33,780 --> 03:55:36,780
You were basically playing a level 20 area as level one.

2538
03:55:37,780 --> 03:55:40,780
You mean I'm not making the R word audio?

2539
03:55:41,780 --> 03:55:43,780
Reduce bender machine.

2540
03:55:43,780 --> 03:55:48,780
You emit a burst of ace when struck by melee attacks, which has a chance to freeze.

2541
03:55:49,780 --> 03:55:51,780
Can I do that with the fire one?

2542
03:55:52,780 --> 03:55:55,780
Because I have one that's for fire as well.

2543
03:55:57,780 --> 03:56:01,780
Increase research bonus, that may be worth it.

2544
03:56:03,780 --> 03:56:14,780
I don't know, maybe do health and health, Eve, gene slot, and then we'll buy one more gene.

2545
03:56:15,780 --> 03:56:17,780
Great trap, no I'm not blowing up.

2546
03:56:18,780 --> 03:56:23,780
I only pass stuff, plasmids use less Eve, shut that in the slot.

2547
03:56:24,780 --> 03:56:30,780
I have 45 left, so I don't have enough for anything other than what, careful hacker?

2548
03:56:30,780 --> 03:56:32,780
Extra nutrition to be precise.

2549
03:56:34,780 --> 03:56:37,780
Get the medical expert.

2550
03:56:38,780 --> 03:56:41,780
Medical expert, what are you costing?

2551
03:56:46,780 --> 03:56:49,780
Can carry one more, right okay, so I need to buy the slot.

2552
03:56:53,780 --> 03:56:58,780
Gene, and then, oh I've only got 10 left.

2553
03:56:58,780 --> 03:57:00,780
Oh, did it change its price?

2554
03:57:01,780 --> 03:57:03,780
Alright, I just can't do math very quickly, I think I just can't do math.

2555
03:57:04,780 --> 03:57:05,780
We'll get that next.

2556
03:57:05,780 --> 03:57:07,780
Every three little sisters help you get a wee teddy bear.

2557
03:57:07,780 --> 03:57:08,780
Okay, that's cute.

2558
03:57:10,780 --> 03:57:14,780
Alright, she wants to take me, oh no there's a corpse back here, hold on.

2559
03:57:16,780 --> 03:57:17,780
What are you learning?

2560
03:57:18,780 --> 03:57:23,780
Okay, there's a corpse back here, I now have, like, is there not a corpse on it?

2561
03:57:29,780 --> 03:57:32,780
Sometimes she's a lie, shouldn't be comfortable to me.

2562
03:57:34,780 --> 03:57:36,780
Of course there's a lot of salt for it.

2563
03:57:50,780 --> 03:57:51,780
There you go.

2564
03:57:51,780 --> 03:57:53,780
Hey, off you pop darling.

2565
03:57:59,780 --> 03:58:03,780
It is, you keep that angel company darling.

2566
03:58:03,780 --> 03:58:05,780
You keep that angel company darling.

2567
03:58:27,780 --> 03:58:28,780
Oh, sorry darling.

2568
03:58:29,780 --> 03:58:31,780
I just think I'm gonna have to do that.

2569
03:58:34,780 --> 03:58:35,780
How could you?

2570
03:58:35,780 --> 03:58:37,780
I'll not be toyed with.

2571
03:58:37,780 --> 03:58:39,780
I just got a bomb nade to her.

2572
03:58:47,780 --> 03:58:48,780
Y'all done?

2573
03:58:48,780 --> 03:58:49,780
Right, climb aboard.

2574
03:58:49,780 --> 03:58:52,780
Daddy, are you taking me home too?

2575
03:58:52,780 --> 03:58:53,780
Very shortly, yes.

2576
03:58:53,780 --> 03:58:55,780
You need to just give me a second,

2577
03:58:55,780 --> 03:58:57,780
because we're currently getting annihilated right now,

2578
03:58:57,780 --> 03:58:59,780
but it's not your fault, it's my fault because I got killed.

2579
03:59:04,780 --> 03:59:05,780
Oh, come on.

2580
03:59:07,780 --> 03:59:08,780
There we go.

2581
03:59:11,780 --> 03:59:14,780
Also, Strani, you can destroy heal stations to get a free health kit.

2582
03:59:14,780 --> 03:59:16,780
I did not know that.

2583
03:59:16,780 --> 03:59:17,780
Thank you.

2584
03:59:23,780 --> 03:59:25,780
Not bravo for that one.

2585
03:59:27,780 --> 03:59:29,780
So I can destroy these?

2586
03:59:30,780 --> 03:59:33,780
No, okay, just the heal station.

2587
03:59:36,780 --> 03:59:38,780
We're picking up some stuff.

2588
03:59:38,780 --> 03:59:42,780
If only she could improve her aim real and true.

2589
03:59:42,780 --> 03:59:44,780
There's literally no aim assistance going on,

2590
03:59:44,780 --> 03:59:46,780
which I'm very surprised about.

2591
03:59:46,780 --> 03:59:49,780
Normally, like when the game acknowledges...

2592
03:59:51,780 --> 03:59:52,780
Who goes there?

2593
03:59:52,780 --> 03:59:54,780
Sorry, that was a big one.

2594
03:59:55,780 --> 03:59:56,780
Sorry.

2595
03:59:57,780 --> 03:59:59,780
Normally, the game acknowledges

2596
03:59:59,780 --> 04:00:02,780
when you've swapped to a mouse.

2597
04:00:03,780 --> 04:00:06,780
Keep on the move to a controller.

2598
04:00:11,780 --> 04:00:12,780
I'm out of ammo.

2599
04:00:19,780 --> 04:00:23,780
Normally, the game acknowledges

2600
04:00:23,780 --> 04:00:25,780
when you've swapped to a mouse,

2601
04:00:25,780 --> 04:00:27,780
but your controller will give you all-away.

2602
04:00:54,780 --> 04:00:57,780
We are done.

2603
04:01:03,780 --> 04:01:04,780
Okay, you're done.

2604
04:01:04,780 --> 04:01:05,780
Melee!

2605
04:01:16,780 --> 04:01:17,780
See you.

2606
04:01:18,780 --> 04:01:19,780
Yeah, yeah.

2607
04:01:19,780 --> 04:01:20,780
Yep.

2608
04:01:22,780 --> 04:01:23,780
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

2609
04:01:23,780 --> 04:01:24,780
Now hurry up.

2610
04:01:25,780 --> 04:01:27,780
I need to put you away somewhere safe.

2611
04:01:27,780 --> 04:01:29,780
I don't know where to put you.

2612
04:01:29,780 --> 04:01:31,780
What does the map tell me?

2613
04:01:31,780 --> 04:01:33,780
If I put you back here, hold on.

2614
04:01:33,780 --> 04:01:35,780
I need to get rid of her.

2615
04:01:35,780 --> 04:01:37,780
Maybe use mine.

2616
04:01:39,780 --> 04:01:40,780
Right there.

2617
04:01:40,780 --> 04:01:41,780
Yes, yes, yes.

2618
04:01:41,780 --> 04:01:43,780
Go be safe, safe, safe, safe, safe.

2619
04:01:43,780 --> 04:01:46,780
Bioshock 2 never had amuses even on console games.

2620
04:01:46,780 --> 04:01:48,780
God, they just not care.

2621
04:01:50,780 --> 04:01:53,780
You okay?

2622
04:02:12,780 --> 04:02:14,780
So we should kill him?

2623
04:02:19,780 --> 04:02:22,780
Oh no, I'm dogging you in, souls, but you've been such a headache.

2624
04:02:22,780 --> 04:02:24,780
I'm dogging you in.

2625
04:02:49,780 --> 04:02:52,780
I accept full responsibility for any anger.

2626
04:02:52,780 --> 04:02:56,780
You may experience before you die.

2627
04:03:07,780 --> 04:03:09,780
Dark Lambs turning up the heat, chief.

2628
04:03:09,780 --> 04:03:11,780
Head on back to the train station.

2629
04:03:11,780 --> 04:03:13,780
Let's hit the trail.

2630
04:03:16,780 --> 04:03:17,780
Through Adam,

2631
04:03:17,780 --> 04:03:20,780
Eleanor will become the daughter of the people.

2632
04:03:20,780 --> 04:03:23,780
A true utopian.

2633
04:03:23,780 --> 04:03:25,780
Brilliant beyond measure,

2634
04:03:25,780 --> 04:03:28,780
but utterly selfless.

2635
04:03:30,780 --> 04:03:32,780
Yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep.

2636
04:03:32,780 --> 04:03:34,780
Sorry, I need to bow.

2637
04:03:36,780 --> 04:03:38,780
I don't...

2638
04:03:41,780 --> 04:03:44,780
Just have them put a rough time

2639
04:03:44,780 --> 04:03:46,780
in the kitchen.

2640
04:03:59,780 --> 04:04:01,780
That's so light.

2641
04:04:06,780 --> 04:04:09,780
Quad, Quad, Quadinoff.

2642
04:04:14,780 --> 04:04:21,260
and cruise maxi big sisters are vulnerable to armor pierce them

2643

04:05:13,820 --> 04:05:18,540
why is she getting held like seriously why is she actually getting held

2649
04:05:18,700 --> 04:05:43,500
i'm literally modding my game tomorrow to have infinite fucking armor and it just never loses

2650
04:05:43,660 --> 04:05:49,900
like the armor because this is getting pretty loose we're getting that audio this is a win

2651
04:05:49,900 --> 04:05:52,860
not you celebrating me getting annoyed at the game

2652
04:05:59,660 --> 04:06:04,940
sorry i'm getting pizza i think i've decided i'm gonna get like so so in australia they do this

2653
04:06:04,940 --> 04:06:10,140

2654
04:06:11,100 --> 04:06:15,260

2657
04:06:40,380 --> 04:06:43,740
uh

2658
04:06:50,460 --> 04:06:54,220
i spent more time swapping between the fucking weapon

2659
04:06:58,620 --> 04:07:04,220
sometimes the advertising price is a suggestion like it's actually really funny sorry that's

2660
04:07:04,940 --> 04:07:06,780
years of stanley's betrayal

2661
04:07:11,100 --> 04:07:19,500
merely a suggestion in compromising ellen and now he seals his fate you see it was stanley

2662
04:07:19,500 --> 04:07:25,420
who turned you into ryan and a 14 dollar ring is responsible for what you have become the

2663
04:07:25,500 --> 04:07:29,820

04:08:24,860 --> 04:08:30,060
mother's not lying this time father he really did it to both of us

2673
04:08:32,140 --> 04:08:34,300
sparing people is a trigger for bear or ending

2674
04:08:36,460 --> 04:08:39,660
so lamb broke out and she's coming back

2675

2676

elevator music oh anonymous thank you for the 20 tip you didn't put a message

04:09:00,060 --> 04:09:03,900

2679
04:09:05,260 --> 04:09:09,820
angrily r-word self in an audio actually that's such a bizarre fucking sentence structure

2680
04:09:10,540 --> 04:09:13,580
end of the line if we have to finish the game

2681
04:09:13,580 --> 04:09:19,900
we must use an atom to force all rapture's minds and memories into the poor girl lamb reckons it'll

04:09:19,900 --> 04:09:24,620
make that child mommy did you catch that vealers on holidays now are we what does that mean

04:09:24,620 --> 04:09:30,220
ladies beneath fontaine headquarters and to keep you alive we need to sneak in what does that mean

2684
04:09:30,220 --> 04:09:35,020
if we're on holodex is that a good thing is that promotion do we need to tweet about it is it like

2685
04:09:35,660 --> 04:09:38,540
that needs to tell management to tweet about it because it's a big achievement

2686
04:09:39,500 --> 04:09:45,260
there's still a bit left of the game from what i remember you're part of an uh i like the sentence

2687
04:09:45,260 --> 04:09:50,060
right well i took away from that ryan is responsible for what i've become addicted to strong

04:11:31,180 --> 04:11:34,140
so

2701
04:11:44,780 --> 04:11:50,060
atlantic uh i mean honestly we're looking a little bit close to the end if this map is

2702
04:11:50,060 --> 04:11:55,340
anything to go by now i did say 10 hours which is why i put part two like for later

2703

so should i wrap it up now so part two is still me i don't i'm not i'm not sure what to do

2704
04:12:06,140 --> 04:12:08,780
from a gaming perspective you're like non-indie devils

2705
04:12:11,260 --> 04:12:15,820
big enough to be registered on the vtuber pokedex this is the best way to describe it

2706
04:12:17,340 --> 04:12:21,020
yeah that's cute honestly you rush the game a lot i don't know

2707
04:12:21,660 --> 04:12:27,740
you have a fair bit to go i mean there's plenty to go okay we'll go to the next map and then

2708
04:12:28,380 --> 04:12:31,580
i'll wrap up there so there's still some meat to the game tomorrow

2709
04:12:35,660 --> 04:12:41,340
this facility belongs to the city now to ryan industry didn't always be the least until the

2710
04:12:41,340 --> 04:12:48,300
rioting subsides while it is unfortunate that such measures had to be taken i must admit

2711
04:12:49,180 --> 04:12:52,300
it is gratifying to see this building condemned

2712
04:12:55,660 --> 04:13:00,140
about it i mean my pinterest yeah i have to update everyone's patreon's and stuff i've got a lot

2716
04:13:26,460 --> 04:13:31,340
when you see meat it reminds me of the thai stream did you like it i think it went really well

2717
04:13:32,460 --> 04:13:37,900
i i listened to some of it because i was like oh surely they could still hear me a little bit

2718
04:13:37,900 --> 04:13:43,340
when i'm talking nope when i was thigh cupping the microphone you could hear nothing all you heard was

2719
04:13:48,060 --> 04:13:53,900
with ear cupping basically is how it went uh i thought it wasn't that bad it's definitely not

2720
04:13:53,900 --> 04:14:00,140
bad the thai stream was amazing we did try and tell you i'm a little bit of a dumb dumb please

2738
04:16:18,060 --> 04:16:27,820
i was wrapped you're looking i mean it looks all right i suppose that's why you need a train

2739
04:16:27,820 --> 04:16:31,660
to get from building to building because they can't have a building too big or the pressure's too much

2740
04:16:34,780 --> 04:16:39,020
the atoms come from a sea slug oh my god sea slug for gen two come pray

2741
04:16:40,540 --> 04:16:44,060

2744
04:16:52,700 --> 04:17:00,700

A little squeeze about your knees. What was that?

2748
04:18:00,700 --> 04:18:05,700
Where are you?

2749
04:18:12,700 --> 04:18:15,700
Alright.

2750
04:18:30,700 --> 04:18:35,700
Been a while since I've used any of that.

2751
04:18:39,700 --> 04:18:44,700
Hmm? Wasn't there not a guy up here?

2752
04:18:47,700 --> 04:18:51,700
Monk!

2753
04:18:51,700 --> 04:18:56,700
Oh, she's coming to get me.

2754
04:18:56,700 --> 04:19:03,700
There's profit. Wait, have I maxed out on them and that's why I can't capture them anymore?

2755
04:19:03,700 --> 04:19:08,700
I think so! I think, can you max out on someone?

2756
04:19:08,700 --> 04:19:13,700
Oh, hell, that has to be Gil, Alex.

2757
04:19:20,700 --> 04:19:26,700
You don't fit in with the poor, poor thing?

2758
04:19:26,700 --> 04:19:32,700
Hi. Sorry, that song's really stuck in my head right now.

2759
04:19:32,700 --> 04:19:37,700
The song wasn't even like that, it was just like my brain was like...

2760
04:20:02,700 --> 04:20:07,700
Bye.

2761
04:20:32,700 --> 04:20:46,700
Okay.

2762
04:20:46,700 --> 04:20:51,700
Grease damage.

2763
04:21:02,700 --> 04:21:10,700
Okay. Take whatever he had on him, jeez.

2764
04:21:10,700 --> 04:21:15,700
Okay, we're in.

2765
04:21:15,700 --> 04:21:22,700
That was anti-climactic. That was the easiest part of the game.

2766
04:21:33,700 --> 04:21:38,700
Penetrate. Oh!

2767
04:21:53,700 --> 04:21:58,700
Uh, they're giving me some supplies as well.

2768
04:22:03,700 --> 04:22:08,700
Please be patient, gentle.

2769
04:22:12,700 --> 04:22:17,700
Did it work?

2770
04:22:17,700 --> 04:22:22,700
What? What? What? What? What? What? What? What? What? What? What?

2771
04:22:32,700 --> 04:22:39,700
There's the station for respawning. Are we about to get jumped?

2772
04:23:02,700 --> 04:23:07,700
Hmm?

2773
04:23:14,700 --> 04:23:19,700
What?

2774
04:23:25,700 --> 04:23:30,700
Okay.

2775
04:23:32,700 --> 04:23:37,700
Okay, great. If you're so keen to help, the restrooms need a good scrap.

2776
04:23:37,700 --> 04:23:42,700
It's a clerk to help you along.

2777
04:23:54,700 --> 04:23:59,700
I think I hear a big daddy.

2778
04:24:00,700 --> 04:24:04,700
Are you up here?

2779
04:24:04,700 --> 04:24:09,700
Okay, let's see. What have we got? One procs on my mind.

2780
04:24:09,700 --> 04:24:14,700
Well...

2781
04:24:14,700 --> 04:24:19,700
What the fuck is that?

2782
04:24:19,700 --> 04:24:24,700
Oh, jeez, Louise!

2783
04:24:25,700 --> 04:24:30,700
What the fuck is that?

2784
04:24:30,700 --> 04:24:35,700
Oh, jeez, Louise!

2785
04:24:46,700 --> 04:24:51,700
Please stop you're killing me, but like, successfully.

2786
04:24:54,700 --> 04:24:59,700
You're fine, you're fine, breathe, breathe, breathe, you're fine, you're fine.

2787
04:24:59,700 --> 04:25:06,700
Promise you're okay. Harder, literally, it's harder than that fucking miniboss fight that was there two times ago.

2788
04:25:06,700 --> 04:25:15,700
I'm not sure whoever, like, balanced easy mode, but man did not pay attention to the game, like, sorry.

2789
04:25:15,700 --> 04:25:20,700
What am I to do?

2790
04:25:20,700 --> 04:25:24,700
I'm sorry, I need to get your stuff right. What would you like?

2791
04:25:24,700 --> 04:25:28,700
Oh, this? Okay, right, here you go.

2792
04:25:28,700 --> 04:25:33,700
Right, you enjoy grabbing all that, knock yourself out.

There you go, honey bun. All yours.

2794
04:25:38,700 --> 04:25:45,700
Right, you just quickly do that because I actually don't have a lot to my name right now.

2795
04:25:45,700 --> 04:25:50,700
There you go.

2796
04:25:50,700 --> 04:25:55,700
Well, that sounds absolute horrifying. What even are you?

2797
04:25:55,700 --> 04:26:00,700
What? Are you a mini-daddy?

2798

2831
04:31:39,220 --> 04:31:48,380

2832
04:31:48,380 --> 04:32:01,420
game to give me some I don't know I don't know chief I don't know the drills

2833
04:32:01,420 --> 04:32:05,540
the strongest weapon in the game with that actually

2834
04:32:09,180 --> 04:32:18,020
had a my next station that can put that vending machine genetic things back

2835
04:32:18,020 --> 04:32:27,380
there on the wall I don't know how many extra slots I have I got my scary jean

2836
04:32:27,380 --> 04:32:41,820
bank special tonics one two three and four it looks like there's four that

2837
04:32:41,820 --> 04:32:45,460
I could have on right now but I don't

2838
04:32:51,820 --> 04:33:02,260
electrical form maybe incinerate I'll do another health and an ease change the

2839
04:33:02,260 --> 04:33:08,700
passive to get drill buffs and just use the drill decoy security command telecom

2840
04:33:08,700 --> 04:33:17,300
uses those hands after delay extra nutrition no headhunter

2841
04:33:18,660 --> 04:33:23,340
cameras and turrets take longer to see take less damage from fire I don't even

2842
04:33:23,340 --> 04:33:30,780
get attacked by fire health stations refill is all handy man I mean if I

2843
04:33:30,780 --> 04:33:39,860
need kingdoms that ever increase bizarre my favorite part is the tonic

2844
04:33:39,860 --> 04:33:49,020
bills I went through drill extended real research life is it longer short

2845
04:33:49,020 --> 04:33:52,620
circuit to your electrical attacks disable security devices permanent

2846
04:33:53,420 --> 04:34:02,180
I mean that's good to me just upgrade that I'm probably doing this terribly

2847
04:34:02,180 --> 04:34:05,180
wrong and apologize

2848
04:34:08,180 --> 04:34:15,580

2854
04:34:57,700 --> 04:35:01,700
increase the cost of plasma that limits with inflation to the drill

2855
04:35:01,700 --> 04:35:11,900
only fuck no they like passive freeze drill and then what passive sometimes

2856
04:35:11,900 --> 04:35:21,900

04:35:27,460 --> 04:35:36,260
game wants from me and then just sure but by a shock to made a better job than

2859
04:35:36,260 --> 04:35:43,700

04:36:43,900 --> 04:36:52,460
really don't you dare touch that signal relay delta it's value is 10 times your

2868
04:36:53,460 --> 04:36:56,900
I'm not to do something

2869
04:37:11,340 --> 04:37:15,340

2871
04:37:34,020 --> 04:37:47,500
Oh, my God, couldn't just insufficient funds for a buyout, Lamal.

2872
04:37:47,500 --> 04:37:49,500
Not easy.

2873
04:37:49,500 --> 04:37:57,500
Oh, I'm out of everything.

2874
04:37:57,500 --> 04:38:03,900
Am I missing some valuable details?

2875
04:38:03,900 --> 04:38:10,900
Well, they seem to have a decent amount of ammo in them.

2876
04:38:10,900 --> 04:38:11,900
Have to go to sleep.

2877
04:38:11,900 --> 04:38:12,900
Right, well, sleepyhead.

2878
04:38:12,900 --> 04:38:13,900
Thank you for hanging.

2879
04:38:13,900 --> 04:38:14,900
Uh, where do I go?

2880
04:38:14,900 --> 04:38:15,900
Where do I go?

2881
04:38:15,900 --> 04:38:16,900
Have I been this way?

2882
04:38:16,900 --> 04:38:17,900
No, I must have.

2883
04:38:17,900 --> 04:38:18,900
I mean, I came upstairs.

2884
04:38:18,900 --> 04:38:19,900
So I need to go around this way.

2885
04:38:19,900 --> 04:38:20,900
Okay.

2886
04:38:20,900 --> 04:38:40,900
Where did you even spawn in?

2887
04:38:40,900 --> 04:38:47,900
You must have spawned in behind me.

2888
04:38:48,900 --> 04:38:54,900
It wasn't made by Levine, but the team that did try to carry forward the theory somewhat

2889
04:38:54,900 --> 04:39:00,900
dependent on the oddly infinite incorporate some of two's variety of combat.

2890
04:39:00,900 --> 04:39:01,900
I'm nervous.

2891
04:39:01,900 --> 04:39:05,900
If you guys are wanting me to play infinite, I'm nervous.

2892
04:39:05,900 --> 04:39:09,900
Wait, so that's not supposed to go here.

2893
04:39:09,900 --> 04:39:10,900
Show hint.

2894
04:39:10,900 --> 04:39:11,900
Sure.

2895
04:39:11,900 --> 04:39:13,900
Show me hint.

2896
04:39:14,900 --> 04:39:18,900
Destroy the signal really attached to the front of the box shutdown machine located

2897
04:39:18,900 --> 04:39:21,900
in the plasma spectacular theory.

2898
04:39:21,900 --> 04:39:26,900
You need to head back stage to get to the theater.

2899
04:39:26,900 --> 04:39:27,900
Where?

2900
04:39:27,900 --> 04:39:29,900
This way?

2901
04:39:29,900 --> 04:39:31,900
That's a laboratory.

2902
04:39:31,900 --> 04:39:32,900
What?

2903
04:39:32,900 --> 04:39:37,900
This is the theater over here.

2904
04:39:37,900 --> 04:39:41,900
Are you a theater?

2905
04:39:41,900 --> 04:39:48,900
The plasma showroom.

2906
04:39:48,900 --> 04:39:53,900
Please wait to be seen.

2907
04:39:53,900 --> 04:39:59,900
We will wait right here.

2908
04:39:59,900 --> 04:40:00,900
I don't know, chief.

2909
04:40:00,900 --> 04:40:02,900
Looks like we're about to go into a fight.

2910
04:40:02,900 --> 04:40:08,900
I don't know about you, Bumblebee, but incinerate this demonstration.

2911
04:40:08,900 --> 04:40:09,900
What is it?

2912
04:40:09,900 --> 04:40:12,900
Recommending that I swap to incinerate right now?

2913
04:40:12,900 --> 04:40:14,900
Probably.

2914
04:40:14,900 --> 04:40:23,900
Fucking bloody looks like I've done that.

2915
04:40:23,900 --> 04:40:25,900
Bumblebee, can you fuck them up for me?

2916
04:40:25,900 --> 04:40:33,900
I'm like halfway across the map over here.

2917
04:40:34,900 --> 04:40:39,900
Electric prop demonstration.

2918
04:40:39,900 --> 04:40:42,900
Are you okay?

2919
04:40:42,900 --> 04:40:47,900
I don't think Bumblebee is feeling so good right now.

2920
04:40:47,900 --> 04:40:49,900
Swap jeans.

2921
04:40:49,900 --> 04:40:53,900
Put fire on instead of teleka shitness.

2922
04:40:53,900 --> 04:40:56,900
I don't have every bother to use it.

2923
04:40:56,900 --> 04:41:01,900
Please put incinerate on.

2924
04:41:01,900 --> 04:41:03,900
Are you okay?

2925
04:41:03,900 --> 04:41:08,900
Ta-da!

2926
04:41:08,900 --> 04:41:09,900
He's confused.

2927
04:41:09,900 --> 04:41:14,900
They got the set.

2928
04:41:14,900 --> 04:41:21,900
If you like the planter, it's an investment atomic that allows you to name and repair them.

2929
04:41:21,900 --> 04:41:29,900
When the game be giving you bombs out of nowhere, it's not looking good for me.

2930
04:41:29,900 --> 04:41:31,900
Adam Delta.

2931
04:41:31,900 --> 04:41:37,900
One little jab in the arm and even a hopeless underperformer can be the ploy of the month.

2932
04:41:37,900 --> 04:41:38,900
But you should know.

2933
04:41:38,900 --> 04:41:39,900
Look around.

2934
04:41:39,900 --> 04:41:40,900
Is it?

2935
04:41:40,900 --> 04:41:44,900
Sorry, I know you're in dialogue right now, but it's given...

2936
04:41:44,900 --> 04:41:47,900
I'm about to go into a big fight, so I'd rather...

2937
04:41:47,900 --> 04:41:52,900
Oh, I have no money, lover.

2938
04:41:52,900 --> 04:41:55,900
The rapture consumer is indebted to you.

2939
04:41:55,900 --> 04:42:00,900
We are the king of the kink out of our domestic plasma line on you right here.

2940
04:42:00,900 --> 04:42:03,900
Well, let's see if you're staying calm.

2941
04:42:03,900 --> 04:42:11,900
Step on up and take the spotlight.

2942
04:42:11,900 --> 04:42:16,900
Welcome back, Delta.

2943
04:42:16,900 --> 04:42:18,900
Ladies and gentlemen,

2944
04:42:18,900 --> 04:42:21,900
Contained Futuristic Invite you to shed your skepticism,

2945
04:42:21,900 --> 04:42:23,900
Evolve your expectations,

2946
04:42:23,900 --> 04:42:25,900
And dissolve your doubt,

2947
04:42:25,900 --> 04:42:26,900
As we unveil the...

2948
04:42:26,900 --> 04:42:28,900
Bumblebee, you're burning the fuck up.

2949
04:42:28,900 --> 04:42:29,900
Can you go behind me?

2950
04:42:29,900 --> 04:42:31,900
You're ruining the show.

2951
04:42:34,900 --> 04:42:37,900
May I have a volunteer from the audience?

2952
04:42:37,900 --> 04:42:39,900
What?

2953
04:42:39,900 --> 04:42:41,900
A new enemy type?

2954
04:42:41,900 --> 04:42:43,900
Come down, don't be shy.

2955
04:42:43,900 --> 04:42:45,900
Think for us.

2956
04:42:45,900 --> 04:42:48,900
I fall in love again.

2957
04:42:48,900 --> 04:42:49,900
How about you, sir?

2958
04:42:49,900 --> 04:42:53,900
How do you even have the guts to say?

2959
04:42:59,900 --> 04:43:01,900
Inferno.

2960
04:43:07,900 --> 04:43:09,900
That seems like it.

2961
04:43:16,900 --> 04:43:17,900
Eh?

2962
04:43:19,900 --> 04:43:21,900
All of you!

2963
04:43:25,900 --> 04:43:27,900
Where are you?

2964
04:43:27,900 --> 04:43:29,900
Oh, please.

2965
04:43:41,900 --> 04:43:44,900
You're not the only one that has fire.

2966
04:43:49,900 --> 04:43:51,900
Oh, please.

2967
04:44:03,900 --> 04:44:05,900
I don't want to...

2968
04:44:05,900 --> 04:44:07,900
I've set a myth.

2969
04:44:14,900 --> 04:44:16,900
Bumblebee Parished.

2970
04:44:16,900 --> 04:44:18,900
Oh, God, what are you?

2971
04:44:18,900 --> 04:44:20,900
Okay, you're like a mini big daddy.

2972
04:44:20,900 --> 04:44:22,900
Okay.

2973
04:44:33,900 --> 04:44:35,900
Win?

2974
04:44:42,900 --> 04:44:44,900
Oh, dear, oh dear.

2975
04:44:49,900 --> 04:44:51,900
That was rather easy.

2976
04:44:51,900 --> 04:44:53,900
I did like this weapon.

2977
04:45:09,900 --> 04:45:11,900
My boy.

2978
04:45:11,900 --> 04:45:13,900
Yeah, boy.

2979
04:45:18,900 --> 04:45:20,900
Okay, we did it.

2980
04:45:20,900 --> 04:45:22,900
I'm going to get electrocuted, though.

2981
04:45:22,900 --> 04:45:24,900
Boom!

2982
04:45:24,900 --> 04:45:27,900
Two of four signals destroyed.

2983
04:45:27,900 --> 04:45:29,900
Okay, we can do it.

2984
04:45:35,900 --> 04:45:37,900
Can I reach you now?

2985
04:45:37,900 --> 04:45:39,900
Oh, wait, telekinesis.

2986
04:45:39,900 --> 04:45:41,900
I just got rid of it.

2987
04:45:44,900 --> 04:45:46,900
I just took off telekinesis.

2988
04:45:48,900 --> 04:45:50,900
Hold on, let me...

2989
04:45:51,900 --> 04:45:53,900
Ah, they respawned.

2990
04:45:53,900 --> 04:45:55,900
Hold on.

2991
04:45:55,900 --> 04:45:57,900
I just took off telekinesis

2992
04:45:57,900 --> 04:45:59,900
and that's clearly what that's for.

2993
04:45:59,900 --> 04:46:01,900
Hold on!

2994
04:46:02,900 --> 04:46:04,900
Let me grab it.

2995
04:46:08,900 --> 04:46:10,900
No?

2996
04:46:11,900 --> 04:46:13,900
Help me.

2997
04:46:13,900 --> 04:46:15,900
Five, two, five, four.

2998
04:46:15,900 --> 04:46:17,900
Four.

2999
04:46:17,900 --> 04:46:19,900
Five, two, five, four.

3000
04:46:19,900 --> 04:46:21,900
Curious.

3001
04:46:22,900 --> 04:46:24,900
Animo Bule!

3002
04:46:41,900 --> 04:46:43,900
Well...

3003
04:46:43,900 --> 04:46:45,900
Oh no, why is this map thing

3004
04:46:45,900 --> 04:46:47,900
not showing me where to go?

3005
04:46:50,900 --> 04:46:52,900
I didn't pick up any more items.

3006
04:46:56,900 --> 04:46:58,900
Is it this way?

3007
04:47:01,900 --> 04:47:03,900
Is it still not this way?

3008
04:47:07,900 --> 04:47:08,900
No, okay.

3009
04:47:08,900 --> 04:47:10,900
Sorry, I'm going too far ahead.

3010
04:47:10,900 --> 04:47:12,900
It's because I discovered this way

3011
04:47:12,900 --> 04:47:14,900
and I'm like, oh, that's where I'm going to progress, right?

3012
04:47:14,900 --> 04:47:16,900
What does the map tell me to do?

3013
04:47:16,900 --> 04:47:18,900
Show hen.

3014
04:47:18,900 --> 04:47:20,900
Destroy the signal relays attached to the...

3015
04:47:20,900 --> 04:47:22,900
located in the marketing department.

3016
04:47:22,900 --> 04:47:25,900
Officers are off to the left of the marketing.

3017
04:47:28,900 --> 04:47:30,900
Upstairs?

3018
04:47:35,900 --> 04:47:37,900
Yes, we recently only have one brand.

3019
04:47:37,900 --> 04:47:40,900
Bring some of this share between us all.

3020
04:47:43,900 --> 04:47:46,900
The offices are to the right, okay?

3021
04:47:46,900 --> 04:47:48,900
I can do that.

3022
04:47:54,900 --> 04:47:56,900
Hi.

3023
04:48:01,900 --> 04:48:04,900
I wish I had a sniper rifle, honestly.

3024
04:48:05,900 --> 04:48:07,900
That doesn't work, you lazy...

3025
04:48:30,900 --> 04:48:33,900
Sorry, I apologize for not commenting too much.

3026
04:48:33,900 --> 04:48:35,900
It's because I'm, like, playing

3027
04:48:35,900 --> 04:48:37,900
and it's hard to, like, commentate

3028
04:48:37,900 --> 04:48:39,900
and play something new for the first time

3029
04:48:39,900 --> 04:48:41,900
and suck at it even...

3030
04:48:41,900 --> 04:48:43,900
like, suck at it terribly.

3031
04:48:45,900 --> 04:48:48,900
What the fuck, it's RGB?

3032
04:48:49,900 --> 04:48:52,900
Unstable teleport plasmid.

3033
04:48:52,900 --> 04:48:54,900
What?

3034
04:49:03,900 --> 04:49:05,900
But she can't remove this.

3035
04:49:05,900 --> 04:49:08,900
This thing inside my body.

3036
04:49:08,900 --> 04:49:10,900
I look in the mirror

3037
04:49:10,900 --> 04:49:12,900
and I see a freak.

3038
04:49:12,900 --> 04:49:14,900
I remember very little.

3039
04:49:14,900 --> 04:49:17,900
Just an artificial sense of peace

3040
04:49:17,900 --> 04:49:20,900
and a compulsive hunger for Adam.

3041
04:49:20,900 --> 04:49:23,900
Dr. Alexander is trying to help me adjust.

3042
04:49:23,900 --> 04:49:26,900
He's responsible for part of my condition.

3043
04:49:26,900 --> 04:49:28,900
I keep getting steamed by accident.

3044
04:49:28,900 --> 04:49:31,900
Momay's a lot thin.

3045
04:49:31,900 --> 04:49:34,900
I'm following the disco light.

3046
04:49:39,900 --> 04:49:41,900
Please stop drinking.

3047
04:49:47,900 --> 04:49:49,900
Over here now.

3048
04:49:49,900 --> 04:49:51,900
Fire.

3049
04:49:56,900 --> 04:49:58,900
Okay, so I'm not...

3050
04:49:58,900 --> 04:50:00,900
I'm not going to the water for, like, a while.

3051
04:50:19,900 --> 04:50:21,900
It's our dirty little secret.

3052
04:50:21,900 --> 04:50:23,900
Dirty little secret.

3053
04:50:23,900 --> 04:50:26,900
And to be frank, a rapture doesn't really want to know.

3054
04:50:26,900 --> 04:50:29,900
Provided the end product is sound.

3055
04:50:29,900 --> 04:50:31,900
The volunteers were...

3056
04:50:31,900 --> 04:50:34,900
as scarce, even as the economy buckled.

3057
04:50:34,900 --> 04:50:36,900
A man named Sinclair approached us

3058
04:50:36,900 --> 04:50:39,900
with a seemingly limitless supply.

3059
04:50:39,900 --> 04:50:42,900
He rented them to us, found sedated.

3060
04:50:42,900 --> 04:50:44,900
No questions asked.

3061
04:50:47,900 --> 04:50:49,900
Where's the last one?

3062
04:50:49,900 --> 04:50:51,900
I tried to really...

3063
04:50:51,900 --> 04:50:53,900
locate in Frank Fontaine's office.

3064
04:50:53,900 --> 04:50:56,900
His office is on the second floor.

3065
04:50:56,900 --> 04:50:59,900
So I'm on the same level as that.

3066
04:51:03,900 --> 04:51:06,900
I'm a bit too big to be jumping a bit like this,

3067
04:51:06,900 --> 04:51:08,900
but right in his office.

3068
04:51:09,900 --> 04:51:12,900
Surprise, editor!

3069
04:51:18,900 --> 04:51:20,900
Fucking gear, eh?

3070
04:51:21,900 --> 04:51:23,900
Spent up traps on it?

3071
04:51:23,900 --> 04:51:26,900
Okay, the arrow is back, so I guess the game saw

3072
04:51:26,900 --> 04:51:29,900
how much I was struggling with my navigation.

3073
04:51:29,900 --> 04:51:32,900
I don't know why the arrow doesn't stay with me all the time.

3074
04:51:32,900 --> 04:51:35,900
I don't know why it's getting me to touch this.

3075
04:51:50,900 --> 04:51:53,900
I'm on E for that one.

3076
04:51:54,900 --> 04:51:56,900
Surprise that...

3077
04:51:56,900 --> 04:51:58,900
Oh, you already took care of them.

3078
04:51:58,900 --> 04:52:00,900
Literally.

3079
04:52:00,900 --> 04:52:02,900
Sometimes it's easy mode.

3080
04:52:02,900 --> 04:52:05,900
Other times it's like, fucking difficult, difficult, lemon difficult.

3081
04:52:05,900 --> 04:52:07,900
Like, what the fuck?

3082
04:52:10,900 --> 04:52:14,900
Increase damage against these guys only, or what?

3083
04:52:16,900 --> 04:52:18,900
Wait, hold on, hold on.

3084
04:52:26,900 --> 04:52:28,900
Got a head off to bed.

3085
04:52:29,900 --> 04:52:32,900
Yeah, I don't think anyone else is on today.

3086
04:52:32,900 --> 04:52:34,900
I think it was just me, Shivi.

3087
04:52:34,900 --> 04:52:36,900
Stop drinking!

3088
04:52:36,900 --> 04:52:38,900
Can't help it, sorry.

3089
04:52:38,900 --> 04:52:40,900
Yeah, I'm fucking drunk again.

3090
04:52:40,900 --> 04:52:42,900
Sorry, I literally can't help it.

3091
04:52:42,900 --> 04:52:46,900
Shivi is doing a member stream if you're a hero member, though.

3092
04:52:49,900 --> 04:52:51,900
Stop getting steam in, is there anything here I need?

3093
04:52:51,900 --> 04:52:53,900
There's a med kit.

3094
04:52:59,900 --> 04:53:01,900
Benefits.

3095
04:53:05,900 --> 04:53:07,900
We made him pop his clogs.

3096
04:53:08,900 --> 04:53:10,900
He couldn't handle it.

3097
04:53:22,900 --> 04:53:24,900
What, does she think she's not a baddie?

3098
04:53:28,900 --> 04:53:30,900
Ask yourself.

3099
04:53:30,900 --> 04:53:32,900
What does Sinclair stand to...?

3100
04:53:44,900 --> 04:53:45,900
Hello again.

3101
04:53:45,900 --> 04:53:46,900
Hi.

3102
04:53:46,900 --> 04:53:49,900
I must assume by now that you're willing to help end my life.

3103
04:53:49,900 --> 04:53:53,900
In exchange, I have prepared a friendly security escort for you.

3104
04:53:53,900 --> 04:53:54,900
Oh.

3105
04:53:54,900 --> 04:53:57,900
Now, there's a switch in here

3106
04:53:57,900 --> 04:54:00,900
which will allow you access to the real laboratories where...

3107
04:54:00,900 --> 04:54:03,900
where what's left of me awaits you.

3108
04:54:03,900 --> 04:54:05,900
What did you do to yourself?

3109
04:54:07,900 --> 04:54:10,900
What did you do to yourself, sir?

3110
04:54:10,900 --> 04:54:13,900
I'm getting nervous for what I'm about to find.

3111
04:54:19,900 --> 04:54:21,900
Stop running like a fool!

3112
04:54:21,900 --> 04:54:22,900
Oh!

3113
04:54:23,900 --> 04:54:24,900
Stop!

3114
04:54:42,900 --> 04:54:45,900
I think I'm going to need to get inferno too.

3115
04:54:45,900 --> 04:54:49,900
Because of the damage over time that inferno also offers is like pretty sweet.

3116
04:54:53,900 --> 04:54:56,900
I thought I was supposed to have a bot with me.

3117
04:54:56,900 --> 04:54:59,900
Well, something's attacking me and I ain't my bot.

3118
04:55:02,900 --> 04:55:04,900
What can one of these guys...

3119
04:55:07,900 --> 04:55:08,900
Knock it off!

3120
04:55:10,900 --> 04:55:12,900
Are they still coming?

3121
04:55:13,900 --> 04:55:14,900
Where?

3122
04:55:14,900 --> 04:55:16,900
Wrap it up!

3123
04:55:18,900 --> 04:55:20,900
Infinite is like Bioshock.

3124
04:55:20,900 --> 04:55:24,900
Infinite is like Bioshock 2 gets hectic a lot of times.

3125
04:55:26,900 --> 04:55:31,900
Someone said Bioshock 2 is the hardest if you want to put them into categories.

3126
04:55:34,900 --> 04:55:36,900
I'm trying to listen to the tape, but it won't let me.

3127
04:55:36,900 --> 04:55:38,900
I'm holding A, but it won't let me listen to the tape.

3128
04:55:38,900 --> 04:55:40,900
And the tape's gone.

3129
04:55:50,900 --> 04:55:52,900
By self-interest.

3130
04:55:52,900 --> 04:55:56,900
Now I am nothing more to her than a failed experiment.

3131
04:55:56,900 --> 04:56:01,900
My scores on tests of intelligence and moral reasoning are still noteworthy.

3132
04:56:01,900 --> 04:56:04,900
I'm trying to tell my uncle and sir wrap up because he keeps coming.

3133
04:56:04,900 --> 04:56:05,900
She hasn't planned for me.

3134
04:56:05,900 --> 04:56:07,900
Turned in the minutes with speed.

3135
04:56:10,900 --> 04:56:13,900
Infinite is fine, but Bioshock 2 gets the hang of it.

3136
04:56:14,900 --> 04:56:16,900
What's with mommy?

3137
04:56:17,900 --> 04:56:22,900
Me absolutely cringing when I was listening over to that audio that I posted.

3138
04:56:22,900 --> 04:56:24,900
Why am I going so...

3139
04:56:25,900 --> 04:56:27,900
Why not let me interact with you?

3140
04:56:33,900 --> 04:56:35,900
Giving Vince a price.

3141
04:56:35,900 --> 04:56:37,900
I know what you're thinking of.

3142
04:56:37,900 --> 04:56:39,900
Okay, we're going to find the hidden lab.

3143
04:56:39,900 --> 04:56:41,900
I'm looking for a sea slug.

3144
04:56:42,900 --> 04:56:46,900
Any slugs that want me to eat them?

3145
04:56:46,900 --> 04:56:48,900
Or however else I harvest them?

3146
04:56:51,900 --> 04:56:53,900
No, no extra sea slugs.

3147
04:56:54,900 --> 04:56:55,900
No.

3148
04:56:56,900 --> 04:56:57,900
Okay then.

3149
04:57:00,900 --> 04:57:02,900
It was a good audio.

3150
04:57:04,900 --> 04:57:08,900
I got lots of marshmallows that were really nice a bit, and I'm happy.

3151
04:57:09,900 --> 04:57:12,900
Here's the sea slug.

3152
04:57:12,900 --> 04:57:13,900
What?

3153
04:57:31,900 --> 04:57:33,900
We'll drink here then.

3154
04:57:35,900 --> 04:57:37,900
Am I getting close to the end?

3155
04:57:37,900 --> 04:57:39,900
Should I pause or do we just...

3156
04:57:43,900 --> 04:57:47,900
Because I'm needing to deal with all the girls' patreons because I'm fucking really behind on them.

3157
04:57:47,900 --> 04:57:49,900
But it's because I'm passing hat.

3158
04:57:49,900 --> 04:57:51,900
Why is it so dark?

3159
04:58:02,900 --> 04:58:04,900
What, I don't like this.

3160
04:58:07,900 --> 04:58:11,900
Oh, I don't like this one bit. Why is it giving me all these supplies?

3161
04:58:12,900 --> 04:58:14,900
Yeah, there's still quite a bit left.

3162
04:58:18,900 --> 04:58:19,900
I can't see anything.

3163
04:58:19,900 --> 04:58:21,900
You know how you can't see anything?

3164
04:58:21,900 --> 04:58:23,900
I can't see anything either.

3165
04:58:24,900 --> 04:58:26,900
Here's our town.

3166
04:58:43,900 --> 04:58:44,900
Huh?

3167
04:58:47,900 --> 04:58:48,900
Huh?

3168
04:58:53,900 --> 04:58:54,900
Uh-huh.

3169
04:58:54,900 --> 04:58:55,900
Uh-huh.

3170
04:58:56,900 --> 04:58:57,900
Uh-huh.

3171
04:59:01,900 --> 04:59:02,900
Mm-hmm.

3172
04:59:05,900 --> 04:59:07,900
Okay, kind of seen a little bit there.

3173
04:59:08,900 --> 04:59:11,900
I hear electricity, so surely that's...

3174
04:59:26,900 --> 04:59:27,900
Nice.

3175
04:59:28,900 --> 04:59:30,900
Fucking scared her at night.

3176
04:59:34,900 --> 04:59:36,900
Can that be a tag?

3177
04:59:37,900 --> 04:59:39,900
I don't know how to add them.

3178
04:59:50,900 --> 04:59:52,900
I'm so fucking scared right now.

3179
04:59:53,900 --> 04:59:56,900
Oh my god, it's giving me bombs and everything.

3180
04:59:56,900 --> 05:00:00,900
Oh my god, it's giving me so many bombs.

3181
05:00:03,900 --> 05:00:05,900
Oh god, I'm scared.

3182
05:00:08,900 --> 05:00:09,900
Oh god.

3183
05:00:10,900 --> 05:00:13,900
Activate the main tower, yeah.

3184
05:00:18,900 --> 05:00:19,900
Okay.

3185
05:00:21,900 --> 05:00:23,900
I think I'm alone.

3186
05:00:25,900 --> 05:00:27,900
I think I'm alone.

3187
05:00:37,900 --> 05:00:38,900
Uh-huh.

3188
05:00:47,900 --> 05:00:48,900
Uh-huh.

3189
05:00:54,900 --> 05:00:55,900
Eh?

3190
05:01:04,900 --> 05:01:05,900
Hey.

3191
05:01:05,900 --> 05:01:07,900
Is it up?

3192
05:01:10,900 --> 05:01:12,900
What is he?

3193
05:01:18,900 --> 05:01:19,900
Uh-huh.

3194
05:01:31,900 --> 05:01:32,900
Sunflower.

3195
05:01:36,900 --> 05:01:38,900
You want to be top man?

3196
05:01:38,900 --> 05:01:40,900
You want to sit in the big chair?

3197
05:01:40,900 --> 05:01:42,900
Well, come and take it.

3198
05:01:47,900 --> 05:01:49,900
Now, why would you recruit them?

3199
05:01:52,900 --> 05:01:54,900
Why would you recruit them?

3200
05:01:55,900 --> 05:01:56,900
Don't be selfish.

3201
05:01:56,900 --> 05:01:57,900
Don't do that.

3202
05:01:58,900 --> 05:02:00,900
Don't be selfish.

3203
05:02:03,900 --> 05:02:04,900
Don't be selfish.

3204
05:02:06,900 --> 05:02:07,900
Don't be selfish.

3205
05:02:11,900 --> 05:02:13,900
Elemental storm.

3206
05:02:13,900 --> 05:02:16,900
Why stick with a born routine when discharging?

3207
05:02:16,900 --> 05:02:20,900
Pest people use this tonic for a scorching, shocking, chilling surprise.

3208
05:02:23,900 --> 05:02:25,900
I don't know what you want from me.

3209
05:02:27,900 --> 05:02:28,900
Am I soloing?

3210
05:02:31,900 --> 05:02:34,900
Target research has been complete.

3211
05:02:34,900 --> 05:02:35,900
A Philly Gundam?

3212
05:02:39,900 --> 05:02:42,900
Why the fuck are you giving me that much money?

3213
05:02:42,900 --> 05:02:44,900
Yakuza, thank you.

3214
05:02:45,900 --> 05:02:46,900
Meow?

3215
05:02:48,900 --> 05:02:49,900
What?

3216
05:02:50,900 --> 05:02:52,900
You give me money for playing so shilly?

3217
05:02:52,900 --> 05:02:53,900
What the fuck?

3218
05:02:53,900 --> 05:02:54,900
Thank you.

3219
05:02:57,900 --> 05:02:58,900
$68?

3220
05:02:58,900 --> 05:03:00,900
What the fuck?

3221
05:03:00,900 --> 05:03:01,900
Is this what you like?

3222
05:03:01,900 --> 05:03:03,900
Yeah, you like this terrible gameplay?

3223
05:03:04,900 --> 05:03:05,900
Yeah.

3224
05:03:05,900 --> 05:03:07,900
Yeah, it's really turning you on, isn't it?

3225
05:03:08,900 --> 05:03:10,900
It's really getting you in the middle.

3226
05:03:11,900 --> 05:03:13,900
I can be your kitten.

3227
05:03:13,900 --> 05:03:15,900
Give me a little discord kitten.

3228
05:03:16,900 --> 05:03:18,900
Daddy, I want discord mate.

3229
05:03:22,900 --> 05:03:23,900
Okay.

3230
05:03:23,900 --> 05:03:24,900
Get back there.

3231
05:03:33,900 --> 05:03:34,900
Kitten or pup?

3232
05:03:36,900 --> 05:03:37,900
I'd never be a kitten.

3233
05:03:40,900 --> 05:03:42,900
Or else how am I going to see my classic line?

3234
05:03:43,900 --> 05:03:44,900
Obvious!

3235
05:03:45,900 --> 05:03:46,900
I don't know what to do.

3236
05:03:49,900 --> 05:03:50,900
Okay, that was lucky.

3237
05:03:50,900 --> 05:03:51,900
That somehow caught on in time.

3238
05:03:51,900 --> 05:03:53,900
New audio, I'll do anything for nature.

3239
05:03:56,900 --> 05:03:57,900
Fucking hell.

3240
05:03:59,900 --> 05:04:00,900
Oh, $21.

3241
05:04:03,900 --> 05:04:05,900
As soon as this is where I'm supposed to go.

3242
05:04:09,900 --> 05:04:11,900
Why is there a life chamber

3243
05:04:11,900 --> 05:04:13,900
and then a boat shut down

3244
05:04:13,900 --> 05:04:15,900
and then a health station?

3245
05:04:18,900 --> 05:04:19,900
Hmm.

3246
05:04:22,900 --> 05:04:23,900
Hmm.

3247
05:04:23,900 --> 05:04:25,900
Try and get the Leo in the room

3248
05:04:25,900 --> 05:04:27,900
before I enter the room.

3249
05:04:29,900 --> 05:04:30,900
Okay.

3250
05:04:32,900 --> 05:04:34,900
I've got my second flower.

3251
05:04:35,900 --> 05:04:37,900
Alright, Kale since you.

3252
05:04:43,900 --> 05:04:44,900
No?

3253
05:04:45,900 --> 05:04:47,900
Am I being pranked?

3254
05:04:47,900 --> 05:04:48,900
What?

3255
05:04:50,900 --> 05:04:52,900
You mother,

3256
05:04:52,900 --> 05:04:55,900
but I thought I got away with it.

3257
05:04:57,900 --> 05:05:00,900
I thought I got away with it.

3258
05:05:00,900 --> 05:05:03,900
I knew there was a fight in here.

3259
05:05:05,900 --> 05:05:07,900
I freaking knew it.

3260
05:05:09,900 --> 05:05:11,900
I freaking told it.

3261
05:05:12,900 --> 05:05:13,900
It's ruining me.

3262
05:05:13,900 --> 05:05:14,900
Oh my god.

3263
05:05:16,900 --> 05:05:18,900
I'm getting kidnapped.

3264
05:05:20,900 --> 05:05:21,900
Thank you guys.

3265
05:05:21,900 --> 05:05:22,900
Okay, they're fully leveled up.

3266
05:05:24,900 --> 05:05:25,900
I'm frozen?

3267
05:05:30,900 --> 05:05:31,900
Ah.

3268
05:05:32,900 --> 05:05:33,900
Ah.

3269
05:05:41,900 --> 05:05:42,900
Uh huh.

3270
05:05:44,900 --> 05:05:46,900
I'm okay, Kalee.

3271
05:05:51,900 --> 05:05:52,900
Okay, we're okay.

3272
05:05:53,900 --> 05:05:55,900
We're okay, we're okay, we're okay.

3273
05:06:10,900 --> 05:06:11,900
She's back.

3274
05:06:11,900 --> 05:06:12,900
She's back.

3275
05:06:16,900 --> 05:06:17,900
I hope not.

3276
05:06:28,900 --> 05:06:29,900
I'm moved.

3277
05:06:31,900 --> 05:06:33,900
I actually can't be all still in that face.

3278
05:06:38,900 --> 05:06:40,900
You rescued me, sir.

3279
05:06:42,900 --> 05:06:44,900
I should have done, I don't know.

3280
05:06:46,900 --> 05:06:49,900
I can't even, I'm just happy to like move and I'm doing it.

3281
05:07:04,900 --> 05:07:05,900
I can't even freeze.

3282
05:07:07,900 --> 05:07:09,900
I can freeze damage.

3283
05:07:10,900 --> 05:07:11,900
Apparently.

3284
05:07:29,900 --> 05:07:31,900
Don't stand in the flames, nah.

3285
05:07:33,900 --> 05:07:35,900
That would be very dangerous and very silly.

3286
05:07:35,900 --> 05:07:37,900
Right, you climb aboard.

3287
05:07:38,900 --> 05:07:39,900
Yep, you're fine.

3288
05:07:40,900 --> 05:07:41,900
Okay, we did it.

3289
05:07:42,900 --> 05:07:43,900
Alright, where's your hiding hole?

3290
05:07:44,900 --> 05:07:46,900
That, the hiding hole is apparently.

3291
05:07:49,900 --> 05:07:51,900
I really can't be arsed with a face,

3292
05:07:51,900 --> 05:07:54,900
so I'm just shoving her in the hole right in you.

3293
05:07:55,900 --> 05:07:56,900
Yep.

3294
05:08:01,900 --> 05:08:03,900
Little sister is smart.

3295
05:08:03,900 --> 05:08:05,900
I don't have a little sister voice though.

3296
05:08:06,900 --> 05:08:08,900
I sound like a man, I'm a man.

3297
05:08:19,900 --> 05:08:21,900
No, they actually bothered to animate her.

3298
05:08:23,900 --> 05:08:25,900
Oh, there's two of them now.

3299
05:08:28,900 --> 05:08:31,900
New meme ASMR, you beg us to complete the game for you

3300
05:08:31,900 --> 05:08:32,900
because it's too difficult.

3301
05:08:32,900 --> 05:08:36,900
Real and true, literally, please, I am on my hands and knees.

3302
05:08:36,900 --> 05:08:38,900
If your little helpers keep getting interrupted,

3303
05:08:38,900 --> 05:08:41,900
we'll gather and tell them to get a move on.

3304
05:08:43,900 --> 05:08:45,900
What, so they could do it faster now?

3305
05:08:49,900 --> 05:08:51,900
You mean that was a pair call along

3306
05:08:51,900 --> 05:08:53,900
and I could have got her to harvest the thing

3307
05:08:53,900 --> 05:08:55,900
super fast and easy peasy?

3308
05:08:59,900 --> 05:09:01,900
I'm gonna fart in someone's mouth.

3309
05:09:03,900 --> 05:09:04,900
You're gonna like it.

3310
05:09:14,900 --> 05:09:15,900
See, see.

3311
05:09:15,900 --> 05:09:16,900
Yeah.

3312
05:09:45,900 --> 05:09:49,900
For him at last, it will be instinct.

3313
05:09:53,900 --> 05:09:54,900
Ow.

3314
05:09:58,900 --> 05:09:59,900
Hold on.

3315
05:09:59,900 --> 05:10:03,900
That fucking snapshot of me like getting obliterated by it.

3316
05:10:05,900 --> 05:10:07,900
You find double ammo on destroyed machines,

3317
05:10:07,900 --> 05:10:08,900
but that's lovely.

3318
05:10:11,900 --> 05:10:13,900
That snapshot of the fucking block

3319
05:10:13,900 --> 05:10:15,900
will get coming right for me.

3320
05:10:17,900 --> 05:10:19,900
I can hear someone getting in my way.

3321
05:10:23,900 --> 05:10:25,900
Okay, we're getting somewhere.

3322
05:10:25,900 --> 05:10:28,900
We're getting like stronger in terms of like...

3323
05:10:38,900 --> 05:10:39,900
I think...

3324
05:10:43,900 --> 05:10:45,900
Natural camouflage.

3325
05:10:45,900 --> 05:10:47,900
Need some peace and quiet space in nature.

3326
05:10:47,900 --> 05:10:48,900
Stop moving and just fade away.

3327
05:10:48,900 --> 05:10:50,900
Remember, not seeing is believing.

3328
05:10:54,900 --> 05:10:55,900
Well...

3329
05:10:56,900 --> 05:10:57,900
It's time.

3330
05:11:03,900 --> 05:11:04,900
I think that one's up the table.

3331
05:11:11,900 --> 05:11:12,900
Oh, no.

3332
05:11:14,900 --> 05:11:15,900
I'm already out.

3333
05:11:16,900 --> 05:11:17,900
I'm getting fucking obliterated.

3334
05:11:17,900 --> 05:11:18,900
I can't even see.

3335
05:11:18,900 --> 05:11:19,900
I can't even see.

3336
05:11:19,900 --> 05:11:20,900
I'm getting shagged.

3337
05:11:20,900 --> 05:11:21,900
I'm getting shagged.

3338
05:11:22,900 --> 05:11:23,900
I'm getting shagged.

3339
05:11:27,900 --> 05:11:30,900
Please stop throwing those fucking things around.

3340
05:11:34,900 --> 05:11:35,900
Hey, stop greeting.

3341
05:11:35,900 --> 05:11:36,900
You're okay.

3342
05:11:38,900 --> 05:11:39,900
Upsie pupsie, you're fine.

3343
05:11:40,900 --> 05:11:43,900
Now, natural camouflage with wrench, with opium,

3344
05:11:43,900 --> 05:11:44,900
by a short one.

3345
05:11:44,900 --> 05:11:46,900
I don't even think I came across that.

3346
05:11:48,900 --> 05:11:49,900
Take or choose.

3347
05:11:49,900 --> 05:11:50,900
Can I not carry anything?

3348
05:11:54,900 --> 05:11:56,900
Why can I not take the dollar he does?

3349
05:11:56,900 --> 05:11:58,900
My wallet is full?

3350
05:11:59,900 --> 05:12:00,900
Why?

3351
05:12:00,900 --> 05:12:01,900
No.

3352
05:12:01,900 --> 05:12:04,900
Didn't he make a mechanic where money's every hand

3353
05:12:04,900 --> 05:12:05,900
and then be like,

3354
05:12:05,900 --> 05:12:08,900
oh, your wallet is bursting at the seams.

3355
05:12:08,900 --> 05:12:09,900
No, it's not.

3356
05:12:12,900 --> 05:12:14,900
Don't be telling Faberino's like that.

3357
05:12:14,900 --> 05:12:16,900
Sorry, I can hear something tingling in.

3358
05:12:16,900 --> 05:12:17,900
All right, there you go.

3359
05:12:19,900 --> 05:12:21,900
This is where they bound us together, Father.

3360
05:12:22,900 --> 05:12:23,900
Playing God.

3361
05:12:23,900 --> 05:12:26,900
You were the only good thing that Rapture ever gave me.

3362
05:12:30,900 --> 05:12:32,900
Experimented on what, girl?

3363
05:12:35,900 --> 05:12:36,900
What's that foxy?

3364
05:12:42,900 --> 05:12:45,900
She was to be an heir to my life's work.

3365
05:12:45,900 --> 05:12:46,900
She's my problem now.

3366
05:12:46,900 --> 05:12:49,900
And this is where they changed her,

3367
05:12:49,900 --> 05:12:51,900
bonding her to you.

3368
05:12:53,900 --> 05:12:54,900
It's blah, blah, blah.

3369
05:12:54,900 --> 05:12:55,900
I forget it.

3370
05:12:56,900 --> 05:12:58,900
I'm just going to buy everything.

3371
05:12:58,900 --> 05:13:01,900
Since I'm full of money, I'm buying everything.

3372
05:13:01,900 --> 05:13:05,900
The child she was died in this room.

3373
05:13:09,900 --> 05:13:10,900
Like her being a Barbie.

3374
05:13:11,900 --> 05:13:12,900
Hello?

3375
05:13:12,900 --> 05:13:13,900
Hi.

3376
05:13:15,900 --> 05:13:16,900
I know you're in there.

3377
05:13:16,900 --> 05:13:17,900
I know who you are.

3378
05:13:21,900 --> 05:13:22,900
Hi.

3379
05:13:27,900 --> 05:13:28,900
Oh, wait.

3380
05:13:28,900 --> 05:13:30,900
I've already maxed out on those guys.

3381
05:13:32,900 --> 05:13:33,900
What?

3382
05:13:34,900 --> 05:13:35,900
Did I not?

3383
05:13:35,900 --> 05:13:36,900
I was going to say that.

3384
05:13:36,900 --> 05:13:37,900
I don't think I'm going to dunk that animal.

3385
05:13:40,900 --> 05:13:41,900
I have a Vita chain burst.

3386
05:13:41,900 --> 05:13:43,900
Let's me know some buzz what happened.

3387
05:13:44,900 --> 05:13:46,900
Something's bursting at the seams.

3388
05:13:46,900 --> 05:13:47,900
There's no more wallet.

3389
05:13:47,900 --> 05:13:49,900
No, I've not been picked with this game.

3390
05:13:51,900 --> 05:13:53,900
Some streams, I'm like super teasy-teasy,

3391
05:13:53,900 --> 05:13:58,900
but like because this game, I fucking suck at it.

3392
05:13:58,900 --> 05:14:00,900
I'm like trying so hard not to be ridiculous.

3393
05:14:02,900 --> 05:14:06,900
This is so bad at all.

3394
05:14:08,900 --> 05:14:09,900
All right, sport.

3395
05:14:09,900 --> 05:14:10,900
Time to feed the fish.

3396
05:14:10,900 --> 05:14:14,900
Head on back to Alexander's tank and put those plants in.

3397
05:14:18,900 --> 05:14:21,900
I have a target research complete.

3398
05:14:21,900 --> 05:14:22,900
Oh, I've already done on him.

3399
05:14:29,900 --> 05:14:30,900
Poor Gilbert.

3400
05:14:32,900 --> 05:14:34,900
Wait, that's not have a ween on my back.

3401
05:14:42,900 --> 05:14:43,900
I still have a ween on my back.

3402
05:14:43,900 --> 05:14:44,900
Oh my God.

3403
05:14:44,900 --> 05:14:46,900
I'm like putting her on all these things.

3404
05:14:47,900 --> 05:14:48,900
I'm so sorry.

3405
05:14:48,900 --> 05:14:49,900
There you go, darling.

3406
05:14:52,900 --> 05:14:54,900
I didn't realize I had a ween on my back.

3407
05:15:01,900 --> 05:15:04,900
I don't feature the idea of my memories and personality

3408
05:15:04,900 --> 05:15:07,900
being stored in the head of some saintly child

3409
05:15:07,900 --> 05:15:11,900
like just one more dusty old book library.

3410
05:15:32,900 --> 05:15:37,900
There's a lot of recoil on that one, bro.

3411
05:15:45,900 --> 05:15:46,900
Whoa.

3412
05:15:46,900 --> 05:15:47,900
Did you see that?

3413
05:15:47,900 --> 05:15:49,900
They're like fucking immediately to the left.

3414
05:15:51,900 --> 05:15:52,900
Wait, did I feel it?

3415
05:15:52,900 --> 05:15:53,900
Did those guys get it?

3416
05:15:53,900 --> 05:15:54,900
I have, right?

3417
05:15:54,900 --> 05:15:55,900
Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.

3418
05:15:57,900 --> 05:15:59,900
Sorry, I'm probably going to have to win this one.

3419
05:16:00,900 --> 05:16:01,900
Hey, get on my back.

3420
05:16:01,900 --> 05:16:02,900
Get on my back.

3421
05:16:06,900 --> 05:16:07,900
Where is this funny?

3422
05:16:10,900 --> 05:16:11,900
Jesus.

3423
05:16:14,900 --> 05:16:16,900
It's not achieving for something.

3424
05:16:18,900 --> 05:16:19,900
I'll know after.

3425
05:16:25,900 --> 05:16:27,900
I mean, it could have been worse.

3426
05:16:27,900 --> 05:16:29,900
This could have been better than I thought.

3427
05:16:30,900 --> 05:16:31,900
Is it actually that way?

3428
05:16:31,900 --> 05:16:33,900
Okay, it's like literally right out there.

3429
05:16:33,900 --> 05:16:35,900
Just because it's so close, yes,

3430
05:16:35,900 --> 05:16:37,900
I will allow you to extract the atom.

3431
05:16:37,900 --> 05:16:38,900
Go.

3432
05:16:38,900 --> 05:16:40,900
Make it quick, darling.

3433
05:16:40,900 --> 05:16:43,900
And then I will put you in the safety chamber, okay?

3434
05:16:43,900 --> 05:16:45,900
Just make it easy on me because

3435
05:16:46,900 --> 05:16:49,900
mommy's getting tired of all these fights, darling.

3436
05:16:50,900 --> 05:16:51,900
Wrap it up.

3437
05:16:58,900 --> 05:17:02,900
They're like giving me a lot more of those guys.

3438
05:17:21,900 --> 05:17:22,900
Where are they?

3439
05:17:23,900 --> 05:17:25,900
I hear lots of noises, but I didn't see them.

3440
05:17:28,900 --> 05:17:31,900
Who is sending RPGs on a little girl?

3441
05:17:31,900 --> 05:17:33,900
What the fuck was that?

3442
05:17:33,900 --> 05:17:34,900
Who was that?

3443
05:17:39,900 --> 05:17:41,900
Where was the RGB?

3444
05:17:41,900 --> 05:17:42,900
Oh.

3445
05:17:44,900 --> 05:17:45,900
I knew you, Fanny.

3446
05:17:45,900 --> 05:17:46,900
I knew you, Fanny.

3447
05:17:56,900 --> 05:17:58,900
I got him, I got him, I got him, I got him.

3448
05:17:58,900 --> 05:17:59,900
You're fine, you're safe.

3449
05:18:03,900 --> 05:18:04,900
Yeah.

3450
05:18:08,900 --> 05:18:09,900
Are you done?

3451
05:18:10,900 --> 05:18:14,900
Okay, there you feel better after that?

3452
05:18:14,900 --> 05:18:15,900
Right, come on.

3453
05:18:15,900 --> 05:18:17,900
You're going in the chute.

3454
05:18:17,900 --> 05:18:19,900
Yes, it's sleepy time for you.

3455
05:18:19,900 --> 05:18:22,900
It's way past your bedtime, darling.

3456
05:18:22,900 --> 05:18:24,900
Where is your Haiti hole?

3457
05:18:27,900 --> 05:18:29,900
Your Haiti hole is right up ahead.

3458
05:18:29,900 --> 05:18:30,900
Okay.

3459
05:18:31,900 --> 05:18:34,900
I'm going to scavenge a hell of a thing.

3460
05:18:34,900 --> 05:18:36,900
Oh, that's good.

3461
05:18:37,900 --> 05:18:38,900
Oh, sexy.

3462
05:18:40,900 --> 05:18:41,900
So fed.

3463
05:18:42,900 --> 05:18:43,900
Right, you go home.

3464
05:18:45,900 --> 05:18:46,900
And you pop.

3465
05:18:57,900 --> 05:18:59,900
It's from mommy of the year.

3466
05:19:00,900 --> 05:19:02,900
You know, I'll piss off a big sister.

3467
05:19:06,900 --> 05:19:07,900
Oh.

3468
05:19:11,900 --> 05:19:13,900
He's seeking rockets.

3469
05:19:15,900 --> 05:19:18,900
Estonia is struggling with the labors of motherhood.

3470
05:19:23,900 --> 05:19:24,900
What are you doing?

3471
05:19:24,900 --> 05:19:26,900
Is he going to help me in the fight?

3472
05:19:30,900 --> 05:19:31,900
Oh, oh.

3473
05:19:32,900 --> 05:19:33,900
That's my game book.

3474
05:19:34,900 --> 05:19:37,900
I was like, okay, here comes the fight.

3475
05:19:39,900 --> 05:19:40,900
Okay, let me try again.

3476
05:19:40,900 --> 05:19:41,900
Let me try again.

3477
05:19:41,900 --> 05:19:42,900
Whistling.

3478
05:19:42,900 --> 05:19:44,900
Sorry, this game is about it.

3479
05:19:44,900 --> 05:19:46,900
It is what it is.

3480
05:19:48,900 --> 05:19:51,900
Big sister spawning and literally killed my game, honestly.

3481
05:19:51,900 --> 05:19:54,900
I don't know if the big daddy was supposed to come in there though,

3482
05:19:54,900 --> 05:19:56,900
because there's no way with them.

3483
05:19:57,900 --> 05:19:58,900
So.

3484
05:19:58,900 --> 05:19:59,900
Hi.

3485
05:20:00,900 --> 05:20:01,900
I'll try that again.

3486
05:20:02,900 --> 05:20:03,900
Yes, continue.

3487
05:20:03,900 --> 05:20:05,900
If I didn't lose too much progress.

3488
05:20:05,900 --> 05:20:07,900
Hopefully it saved putting her in the tunnel,

3489
05:20:07,900 --> 05:20:09,900
so I don't have to deal with that again.

3490
05:20:09,900 --> 05:20:11,900
Let's find out what the last checkpoint is.

3491
05:20:20,900 --> 05:20:22,900
You're trolling, right?

3492
05:20:31,900 --> 05:20:32,900
You're trolling.

3493
05:20:46,900 --> 05:20:47,900
Um.

3494
05:20:49,900 --> 05:20:50,900
Ray.

3495
05:20:53,900 --> 05:20:55,900
With this in mind,

3496
05:20:56,900 --> 05:20:58,900
with this in mind,

3497
05:20:58,900 --> 05:21:02,900
I am going to play part two tomorrow and we'll finish it.

3498
05:21:02,900 --> 05:21:08,900
I am going to play where we got up to offline, okay?

3499
05:21:09,900 --> 05:21:10,900
Is that okay?

3500
05:21:11,900 --> 05:21:12,900
Can we do that?

3501
05:21:12,900 --> 05:21:15,900
Because I don't know why it didn't, like,

3502
05:21:15,900 --> 05:21:17,900
auto save any of that.

3503
05:21:17,900 --> 05:21:19,900
That happened in Halo as well.

3504
05:21:19,900 --> 05:21:21,900
I don't understand why.

3505
05:21:22,900 --> 05:21:24,900
But if that's okay with you guys,

3506
05:21:24,900 --> 05:21:27,900
manually say it literally, what the fuck?

3507
05:21:27,900 --> 05:21:29,900
Like, forgot that I did everything?

3508
05:21:31,900 --> 05:21:33,900
I'm so surprised.

3509
05:21:33,900 --> 05:21:36,900
Old games need manual save.

3510
05:21:38,900 --> 05:21:39,900
That's rough.

3511
05:21:39,900 --> 05:21:41,900
I think I was about to finish that map as well.

3512
05:21:43,900 --> 05:21:45,900
That is so, so...

3513
05:21:45,900 --> 05:21:46,900
Punishing rip.

3514
05:21:46,900 --> 05:21:48,900
Okay, what I'll do is...

3515
05:21:49,900 --> 05:21:51,900
I don't think Azura is coming on this show.

3516
05:21:53,900 --> 05:21:54,900
No.

3517
05:21:55,900 --> 05:21:57,900
Um...

3518
05:21:58,900 --> 05:22:00,900
Oh, I can't even redirect anyway.

3519
05:22:01,900 --> 05:22:03,900
Because I don't, I'm not even signed in on YouTube

3520
05:22:03,900 --> 05:22:05,900
because YouTube, like, they kick me out for some reason.

3521
05:22:05,900 --> 05:22:08,900
We're definitely getting that audio ready recently, brah.

3522
05:22:08,900 --> 05:22:09,900
Fucking reason.

3523
05:22:12,900 --> 05:22:15,900
Oh, I'm gonna have to play that offline on my own,

3524
05:22:15,900 --> 05:22:17,900
which makes it even 10 times worse.

3525
05:22:18,900 --> 05:22:20,900
You're at the end of the level.

3526
05:22:20,900 --> 05:22:22,900
Yep, I figured as much.

3527
05:22:22,900 --> 05:22:24,900
I figured we're right at the end of the level.

3528
05:22:28,900 --> 05:22:30,900
To be honest, I'd like to watch you play that part.

3529
05:22:30,900 --> 05:22:33,900
Well, you want me to just play catch up tomorrow?

3530
05:22:33,900 --> 05:22:34,900
I mean, I'm fine.

3531
05:22:35,900 --> 05:22:38,900
Refining it, do it with the cheat codes, get that mud mummet.

3532
05:22:38,900 --> 05:22:40,900
If you want, we can play it together tomorrow from this part.

3533
05:22:40,900 --> 05:22:43,900
I mean, if you don't mind, then I don't mind.

3534
05:22:43,900 --> 05:22:45,900
I just didn't want to bore you with, like, playing through a section.

3535
05:22:45,900 --> 05:22:47,900
We've already, like, done, you know?

3536
05:22:49,900 --> 05:22:50,900
Um...

3537
05:22:51,900 --> 05:22:53,900
But if it's no biggie, then that's fine.

3538
05:22:53,900 --> 05:22:54,900
Um...

3539
05:22:55,900 --> 05:22:58,900
Because I was needing to do a shorter stream anyway today

3540
05:22:58,900 --> 05:23:00,900
because I need to deal with everyone's Patreon.

3541
05:23:00,900 --> 05:23:04,900
And then I think I'm getting a manager put in place, like,

3542
05:23:04,900 --> 05:23:07,900
either today or tomorrow, depending on what happens.

3543
05:23:07,900 --> 05:23:09,900
And then the Clippers are all gonna be contacted

3544
05:23:09,900 --> 05:23:11,900
and all the girls are gonna have new shores

3545
05:23:11,900 --> 05:23:14,900
and send a real short, but they're gone and all that jazz.

3546
05:23:14,900 --> 05:23:15,900
We can do it tomorrow as long as you're happy.

3547
05:23:15,900 --> 05:23:17,900
Okay, as long as you're happy, I'm happy.

3548
05:23:17,900 --> 05:23:19,900
I didn't want to be boring and, like, play through the thing.

3549
05:23:20,900 --> 05:23:23,900
Unfortunately, I can't redirect into anyone at all,

3550
05:23:23,900 --> 05:23:26,900
so, uh, it's just gonna be this.

3551
05:23:26,900 --> 05:23:27,900
Um...

3552
05:23:27,900 --> 05:23:31,900
We're kinda here for you, not to get me who's never been more quiet.

3553
05:23:31,900 --> 05:23:33,900
Should I quickly check out some more small ones?

3554
05:23:34,900 --> 05:23:35,900
Um...

3555
05:23:35,900 --> 05:23:37,900
Literally never been more quiet.

3556
05:23:37,900 --> 05:23:39,900
Just, ugh, infinite, um...

3557
05:23:39,900 --> 05:23:41,900
Please read this to yourself.

3558
05:23:42,900 --> 05:23:44,900
I'm reading to myself.

3559
05:23:47,900 --> 05:23:48,900
Hee-hee-hee.

3560
05:23:51,900 --> 05:23:52,900
Hee-hee-hee.

3561
05:23:54,900 --> 05:23:55,900
Um...

3562
05:23:55,900 --> 05:23:56,900
Right, okay.

3563
05:23:57,900 --> 05:24:00,900
Mommy, forgive me, but you sound so hot when you're mad.

3564
05:24:01,900 --> 05:24:02,900
Do I actually...?

3565
05:24:02,900 --> 05:24:03,900
I just feel like I sound scared.

3566
05:24:03,900 --> 05:24:05,900
Quiet, Lord, you're so strong and we love you.

3567
05:24:05,900 --> 05:24:07,900
Love you too, Lucy.

3568
05:24:07,900 --> 05:24:09,900
Leaving us in the sea?

3569
05:24:09,900 --> 05:24:10,900
This was a great question.

3570
05:24:10,900 --> 05:24:11,900
I had a great laugh!

3571
05:24:11,900 --> 05:24:15,900
You were laughing at me being fricking terrible at this game!

3572
05:24:15,900 --> 05:24:16,900
Are you kidding me?

3573
05:24:16,900 --> 05:24:17,900
I'm getting bull...

3574
05:24:17,900 --> 05:24:18,900
Why are you bullying me?

3575
05:24:18,900 --> 05:24:19,900
Liquid wants to know.

3576
05:24:19,900 --> 05:24:20,900
Why are you bullying me?

3577
05:24:21,900 --> 05:24:22,900
Um...

3578
05:24:23,900 --> 05:24:24,900
Eh, what?

3579
05:24:24,900 --> 05:24:26,900
My pup is suffering from skill issues?

3580
05:24:26,900 --> 05:24:28,900
Or maybe if you say the right thing I could help?

3581
05:24:28,900 --> 05:24:29,900
What?

3582
05:24:29,900 --> 05:24:33,900
You're gonna mainframe into my PC and play it for me?

3583
05:24:34,900 --> 05:24:39,900
Skipping all the power-ups and add-on upgrades while also complaining about game difficulty?

3584
05:24:40,900 --> 05:24:41,900
God, I love my...

3585
05:24:42,900 --> 05:24:43,900
re...

3586
05:24:44,900 --> 05:24:46,900
affectionate cuttlefish!

3587
05:24:46,900 --> 05:24:49,900
I volunteer myself for the post-R word stream?

3588
05:24:52,900 --> 05:24:55,900
Okay, I'm glad it's not annoying for you.

3589
05:24:55,900 --> 05:24:56,900
That's the difference, okay?

3590
05:24:56,900 --> 05:24:57,900
I was...

3591
05:24:57,900 --> 05:24:59,900
I'm sorry, I find it funny when people rage.

3592
05:24:59,900 --> 05:25:00,900
Are you kidding me?

3593
05:25:01,900 --> 05:25:02,900
Are you kidding me?

3594
05:25:04,900 --> 05:25:05,900
Um...

3595
05:25:09,900 --> 05:25:13,900
When you called the little sister pumpkin a male, it's a little sense of cute.

3596
05:25:14,900 --> 05:25:17,900
Cuddles on and just listen to the audio during the streamings.

3597
05:25:17,900 --> 05:25:18,900
I'm really cute there too.

3598
05:25:18,900 --> 05:25:21,900
I'm cute little puppy.

3599
05:25:21,900 --> 05:25:23,900
No, yeah, I'm getting that kind of thing for me.

3600
05:25:23,900 --> 05:25:27,900
I've got it out of my system, although I'm ovulating tomorrow, so...

3601
05:25:28,900 --> 05:25:29,900
You never know.

3602
05:25:29,900 --> 05:25:30,900
You never know.

3603
05:25:30,900 --> 05:25:32,900
I volunteer as tribute.

3604
05:25:33,900 --> 05:25:34,900
Mommy, I'm back!

3605
05:25:34,900 --> 05:25:36,900
Mommy's about to pop off.

3606
05:25:36,900 --> 05:25:37,900
Mommy...

3607
05:25:37,900 --> 05:25:39,900
The game unfortunately crashed and I lost progress,

3608
05:25:39,900 --> 05:25:42,900
but someone said that I was about to finish the game anyway,

3609
05:25:42,900 --> 05:25:45,900
like in license 2 or if I didn't slow down my pace.

3610
05:25:45,900 --> 05:25:47,900
So it works out in the end.

3611
05:25:48,900 --> 05:25:50,900
Mommy, be careful with the mods and code changing

3612
05:25:50,900 --> 05:25:52,900
because it can corrupt your save file.

3613
05:25:52,900 --> 05:25:53,900
Oh god, right?

3614
05:25:53,900 --> 05:25:54,900
Maybe we should just persevere.

3615
05:25:54,900 --> 05:25:55,900
I'll persevere.

3616
05:25:55,900 --> 05:25:59,900
I've done a bit better with my ammo management and stuff.

3617
05:26:00,900 --> 05:26:03,900
I will impregnate this cuttlefish real and true.

3618
05:26:05,900 --> 05:26:06,900
Um...

3619
05:26:06,900 --> 05:26:09,900
I've inked so hard to your audio in your 20k pic already.

3620
05:26:09,900 --> 05:26:12,900
I woke up with a sore bag!

3621
05:26:13,900 --> 05:26:16,900
You inked so much you have a sore bag?

3622
05:26:16,900 --> 05:26:18,900
Is that even possible?

3623
05:26:19,900 --> 05:26:22,900
Is that real or am I being trolled?

3624
05:26:24,900 --> 05:26:25,900
Eh...

3625
05:26:25,900 --> 05:26:26,900
Hi cuttle, sorry.

3626
05:26:26,900 --> 05:26:27,900
Nothing really important to ask.

3627
05:26:27,900 --> 05:26:28,900
I only want to hug you.

3628
05:26:28,900 --> 05:26:30,900
Hug you, love you.

3629
05:26:30,900 --> 05:26:31,900
I love you, Siwi.

3630
05:26:31,900 --> 05:26:32,900
The killer.

3631
05:26:32,900 --> 05:26:33,900
The killer!

3632
05:26:33,900 --> 05:26:35,900
Love you too, Wilson.

3633
05:26:35,900 --> 05:26:38,900
Just sit in Riflin's lap and let him carry you through the game.

3634
05:26:38,900 --> 05:26:40,900
Literally, I'm about to make an audio about me sitting in your lap

3635
05:26:40,900 --> 05:26:42,900
begging for you to carry me through Bioshock

3636
05:26:42,900 --> 05:26:46,900
and then I end up just rambling about how much I actually genuinely enjoy the game.

3637
05:26:46,900 --> 05:26:48,900
I like the plot, I like everything I'm experiencing.

3638
05:26:48,900 --> 05:26:50,900
I just suck at resource management

3639
05:26:50,900 --> 05:26:52,900
and I just want to go pew pew and the enemy's dead

3640
05:26:52,900 --> 05:26:54,900
and I don't have to think about it.

3641
05:26:54,900 --> 05:26:57,900
But I'm actually having to heal and stuff, which is outrageous.

3642
05:26:58,900 --> 05:26:59,900
Eh...

3643
05:26:59,900 --> 05:27:01,900
Got them muscle spasms for inking?

3644
05:27:01,900 --> 05:27:02,900
Yeah, it happens.

3645
05:27:02,900 --> 05:27:04,900
I looked like this!

3646
05:27:04,900 --> 05:27:05,900
This little inkling.

3647
05:27:05,900 --> 05:27:07,900
I love that moat so much.

3648
05:27:07,900 --> 05:27:10,900
I need to extend the ink...

3649
05:27:10,900 --> 05:27:12,900
the...

3650
05:27:12,900 --> 05:27:14,900
the...

3651
05:27:14,900 --> 05:27:16,900
Hi, hi, Stroni.

3652
05:27:16,900 --> 05:27:17,900
I love you but you're a little underpowered

3653
05:27:17,900 --> 05:27:18,900
because you're skipping upgrades.

3654
05:27:18,900 --> 05:27:20,900
That's why you're finding it so hard.

3655
05:27:20,900 --> 05:27:22,900
I'm not finding it hard.

3656
05:27:22,900 --> 05:27:23,900
I'm finding the...

3657
05:27:23,900 --> 05:27:25,900
I've got Ne-Amo to my name.

3658
05:27:25,900 --> 05:27:26,900
Like...

3659
05:27:26,900 --> 05:27:27,900
It's like...

3660
05:27:27,900 --> 05:27:28,900
Into one fight and then I've got nothing.

3661
05:27:28,900 --> 05:27:30,900
Then I have to scavenge.

3662
05:27:30,900 --> 05:27:31,900
And then next fight...

3663
05:27:31,900 --> 05:27:32,900
Nothing.

3664
05:27:32,900 --> 05:27:41,780
and like that's what i'm struggling with. Dan, do I need to break my record? If you ain't gonna

3665
05:27:41,780 --> 05:27:50,020
it's like clear. You struggle with games with cute rages as well. Would that make us your big daddy?

3666
05:27:50,020 --> 05:27:57,220
All I want to be my big daddy? Want me to sit on your lap and get all cozy? And you put your arms

3667
05:27:57,220 --> 05:28:05,700
around me and the controls in front of that. I'll just focus on sitting on your lap. Nice and comfy.

3668
05:28:08,660 --> 05:28:17,700
You can effectively lightning drill smash through the whole game. Fallout 4. I played Fallout 4. It's

3669
05:28:17,700 --> 05:28:22,660
Fallout 4 the one that had the railroad track because I got stuck at the railroad track. I couldn't

3670
05:28:22,660 --> 05:28:29,780
find the layer to the railroad. I don't know where it was but I did the swan at the pond

3671
05:28:29,780 --> 05:28:34,660
in Fallout and then it was like find the railroad track and I couldn't find it and I was stuck.

3672
05:28:37,540 --> 05:28:45,860
Cuddle. Well gaming the dream. Yeah that's 4. Yeah I got stuck at that part. If you want me to

3673
05:28:45,860 --> 05:28:50,180
play Fallout you're gonna have to hold my hand through the railroad section. I don't know where

3674
05:28:50,180 --> 05:28:56,340
it is. I don't know where it is. And I looked up Gates and they're all like oh it's super obvious

3675
05:28:56,340 --> 05:29:02,500
just do this and I was like what? What do you mean just do this? I can't see anything. I freaking went

3676
05:29:02,500 --> 05:29:10,980
through the car park. I was blowing up to smithereens and all that. They did release that Fallout

3677
05:29:10,980 --> 05:29:15,860
London mod. Yeah you just get shanked as soon as you come out of the cryopod. Handholding is good but

3678
05:29:16,180 --> 05:29:22,740
before oh no. Handholding. I'll hold your hand through New Vegas. Oh my god it's Fallout 4 multiplayer

3679
05:29:22,740 --> 05:29:26,420
that would be even better. You guys literally just show me where to go. You're like here's the quest

3680
05:29:26,420 --> 05:29:38,740
go. I'm like yes I will go that way. Lap puppy cuddles trying to distract the refilling the

3681
05:29:38,900 --> 05:29:54,500
carry through Bioshock 2 audio. New Vegas has a multiplayer. Can I play New Vegas multiplayer

3682
05:29:54,500 --> 05:30:00,580
with you guys? Because I got stuck on it on it but if I play it with you guys then I can't get

3683
05:30:00,580 --> 05:30:10,020
stuck so you guys will tell me what to do. Or is it like IP would show? If IP shows rip,

3684
05:30:10,020 --> 05:30:18,580
Skyrim has multiplayer too. New Vegas freezes a lot. Probably not unless there's like a mod.

3685
05:30:19,140 --> 05:30:24,420
It's really buggy. New Vegas multiplayer is a modern game which is a complicated one. Okay well I can't

3686
05:30:24,820 --> 05:30:30,900
even do many things for myself so it'll help you play Fallout Vegas even if I haven't played it.

3687
05:30:31,620 --> 05:30:36,820
I got stuck because I accidentally went down a route that I didn't want and then it was asking

3688
05:30:36,820 --> 05:30:42,180
me to do like 8 billion side quests and I'm like what's the plot? Let me do the main quest.

3689
05:30:43,780 --> 05:30:52,820
Pretty sure IP always shows those mods rip. Well we tried. Single player only. Fallout 76

3690
05:30:52,820 --> 05:31:00,420
has natural multiplayer. Can I play the film with you? They have console commands in Fallout.

3691
05:31:01,700 --> 05:31:11,300
Hackerman I'm in. Hi there just stopping for my periodic reminder that you are amazingly talented.

3692
05:31:11,300 --> 05:31:16,660
Are you joking? Can't even resource manage on a shooter game. I wish so many more people on the

3693
05:31:16,660 --> 05:31:22,420
internet were as kind and loving as you my darling. I may not live a genuinely happy life but

3694
05:31:22,420 --> 05:31:27,300
you are a constant source of joy. Thank you for all you do. I love you. Love you too love you Flynn.

3695
05:31:27,300 --> 05:31:33,780
Thank you for the wonderful all audio for those of us who are the poor very life. Still are you Flynn.

3696
05:31:33,780 --> 05:31:39,460
Always good for you goodies. You don't need an exchange of goodies with me. Good arcs then by the

3697
05:31:39,460 --> 05:31:45,700
way. What are you talking about? I actually am transatlantic. What are you talking about? Oh this

3698
05:31:45,700 --> 05:31:52,340
game is just so intimidating. I dare declare that the ammunition I just simply could not find them

3699
05:31:52,740 --> 05:32:01,380
for they were scattered around this rapture among the evil men who did not repent their sins

3700
05:32:01,380 --> 05:32:07,460
and turned into my biggest enemies. I'm tired of saying I'm going to go eat rest well.

3701
05:32:08,500 --> 05:32:13,380
Rest well, sleep well, sleep the heads. I'm going to chill out and then I'm going to update everyone's

3702
05:32:13,380 --> 05:32:19,300
patreon. That's my goal today and then snippets might have an upload tomorrow depending on how

3703
05:32:19,300 --> 05:32:24,420
much fuel in the tank I have. I will find out afterwards. Preacher strongy main breaks the

3704
05:32:24,420 --> 05:32:33,060
reflins. Hey man. The arcs then isn't funny. I managed to try and maintain it for a little while

3705
05:32:33,060 --> 05:32:41,780
but I do have to state that it was rather it was rather making me struggle with the words that

3706
05:32:41,780 --> 05:32:48,340
were next to come out of my mouth because normally when I am having rapport with yourself there

3707
05:32:48,340 --> 05:32:54,580
reflin it kind of just comes out just as the ink comes out of your tentacle. However,

3708
05:32:55,620 --> 05:32:58,500
I tried my best. I did it for a solid hour did I?

3709
05:33:01,300 --> 05:33:05,700
And the accent was good. Okay maybe I'll try and maintain it all the way through tomorrow's stream

3710
05:33:05,700 --> 05:33:09,460
just to mess with you and don't read this on stream.

3711
05:33:10,260 --> 05:33:19,460
Oh no. Just hi mommy. Just wanted to ask if I can get a hug and a kiss.

3712
05:33:24,660 --> 05:33:29,300
All the kisses for the weekend. The ink that comes out of your tentacle. I'm trying not to laugh.

3713
05:33:29,300 --> 05:33:35,620
What do you mean you're trying not to laugh? I'm having the ceremony. I am explaining to you

3714
05:33:35,620 --> 05:33:41,300
how it works from around these parts. At least they put it in the first time. What?

3715
05:33:43,540 --> 05:33:51,380
Best five dollars I ever spent for the southern accent. It's rather hard to maintain it

3716
05:33:52,180 --> 05:33:58,580
as someone who has only just recently entered the United States of America with this transatlantic

3717
05:33:58,580 --> 05:34:03,780
accent. I should try and get that tenet. Wait does my no my reverb is not going to work.

3718
05:34:04,580 --> 05:34:10,820
Would you kindly do the multicolored color fish flash thing? I do have the ability to do that

3719
05:34:10,820 --> 05:34:18,260
without even trying. Maybe I should oh my arm just came off. Okay don't look at that. My arm just

3720
05:34:18,260 --> 05:34:26,660
popped off. Now this is how I look. Unfortunately the chat does not quite work. You do know we now

3721
05:34:26,660 --> 05:34:33,940
need a meme southern asmr. I can make you some sweet tea. I can make you some delicious homemade

3722
05:34:33,940 --> 05:34:38,420
fried chicken. Speaking of fried chicken I think that's what I'm I know I was gonna get pizza wasn't

3723
05:34:38,420 --> 05:34:47,780
that how it was. Moment know your arm. Literally my arm like pops off. Best hand I'm I'm eating

3724
05:34:47,780 --> 05:34:55,140
that right now. Oh did I convince did I influence you? I'm an influencer. Oh sorry my sorry I don't

3725
05:34:55,140 --> 05:35:00,980
know what happened to my accent there. I'm an influencer and I influenced you to engorge yourself

3726
05:35:00,980 --> 05:35:13,620
on pizza and then yeah nice big damn and then let me rub the belly. I forgot that I was talking about

3727
05:35:13,620 --> 05:35:23,140
I was thinking about. Now I am gonna be doing a hypnosis stream asmr hypnosis soon again.

3728
05:35:23,140 --> 05:35:28,420
I'm not sure if I'm gonna do ear to ear this time. I might just talk in the middle of the

3729
05:35:28,420 --> 05:35:34,660
microphone but then do tingles at either side of the ear. I haven't quite decided yet. Maybe I'll

3730
05:35:34,660 --> 05:35:40,020
tease you a little about going ear to ear but I it's it's it's the work in progress. It's not

3731
05:35:40,020 --> 05:35:46,900
something that can be done overnight you know. Look my twin. I just can't fathom how she's been so

3732
05:35:46,900 --> 05:35:53,300
equal as Scottish and Southern at the same time. Well there's this movie called Princess in the Frog

3733
05:35:53,300 --> 05:36:01,460
all right and then this character her name is Charlotte in the movie okay and her voice is a

3734
05:36:01,460 --> 05:36:08,100
bit lighter than what I'm putting on right now but she has a voice of the south and I am trying to

3735
05:36:08,100 --> 05:36:14,900
mimic that to the best of my ability but I kind of sound like Cartman. I sound like Cartman when

3736
05:36:14,900 --> 05:36:21,780
I go best on my ability. You better recite my authority. Oh I can see them. Oh Prince Naveen.

3737
05:36:22,580 --> 05:36:30,180
I'm sweating like a sinner in church. Oh my I'm so sorry for the sacrilege. I can't help myself

3738
05:36:30,180 --> 05:36:36,180
riefling. I must throw myself upon you at this very moment upon this altar. We can do unspeakable

3739
05:36:36,180 --> 05:36:43,140
things together. I waited for so long so so long. Nina the voice is here.

3740
05:36:47,220 --> 05:36:57,220
I tried I tried but just um at Lamont no. Enkling plus Strone's love equals Prego.

3741
05:36:59,380 --> 05:37:03,380
Very soon we are discussing Donut on rewards later in this week.

3742
05:37:04,340 --> 05:37:08,980
At the end of every week each one of us becomes a freak tonight the DJ makes a noise.

3743
05:37:11,620 --> 05:37:18,260
Um right I am going to go take a little rest and then I'm going to catch up on all the Patreon

3744
05:37:18,260 --> 05:37:21,140
shiz that I need. They've got quite a lot to deal with in the background.

3745
05:37:21,140 --> 05:37:24,100
Strone could you try a quick Strone cutlet impression?

3746
05:37:24,900 --> 05:37:29,540
Oh I don't know. I'm Strone cuttles. I'm Scottish that's all I've got going for me.

3747
05:37:30,100 --> 05:37:30,900
Enk right now.

3748
05:37:35,300 --> 05:37:38,020
Let me the best impersonator confirm real Andrew.

3749
05:37:39,540 --> 05:37:49,140
Right I'm a love all on you um and I am going to play Bioshock tomorrow with you. We will

3750
05:37:49,140 --> 05:37:55,940
replay that section but you have a responsibility riefling not just for making me pregnant with

3751
05:37:55,940 --> 05:38:00,500
my gen one okay you have another responsibility and you're going to have to tell me to save every

3752
05:38:00,500 --> 05:38:06,500
10 minutes or so that you think you can handle that kind of responsibility. Now if you fail

3753
05:38:06,500 --> 05:38:14,180
this responsibility your prostate is mine okay that's what you forfeit if you don't remind me.

3754
05:38:14,180 --> 05:38:21,860
Is the audio happening? I'm not. I think tomorrow an audio will happen not today I've got too much

3755
05:38:21,860 --> 05:38:28,740
responsibilities. This sounds crazy but you know how I posted an audio yesterday um

3756
05:38:30,900 --> 05:38:36,660
I kind of because I fell asleep after inking I

3757
05:38:38,980 --> 05:38:43,860
I inked and then I didn't take care of any of my responsibilities because of it so I

3758
05:38:43,860 --> 05:38:48,980
need to take care of my responsibilities because if I ink again I'm not going to want to do a

3759
05:38:48,980 --> 05:38:56,580
single thing because I always get like tired after inking to you so quite can make her angry again.

3760
05:38:59,300 --> 05:39:05,460
If you're a zeroes mother and she's a mother humanity are you an endeavor endeavoring to

3761
05:39:05,460 --> 05:39:11,620
dominate humanity for the bad? Are you the original problem? No the reeflings changed my heart I don't

3762
05:39:11,620 --> 05:39:17,780
want to kill humanity anymore. Just the high table. She's just like me for real for real.

3763
05:39:21,860 --> 05:39:27,860
I think tomorrow I'm going to ovulate so I think an audio of that ovulate would be

3764
05:39:28,580 --> 05:39:31,380
very nice don't you?

3765
05:39:34,580 --> 05:39:40,500
She wants to play bio you want to play bio show you want to get aggravated no I'm going to go get

3766
05:39:40,500 --> 05:39:48,500
some work diddly done cut my tentacle mommy go get that good sleep okay thank you so much I give you kisses

3767
05:39:51,060 --> 05:39:56,180
and I see you tomorrow I won't redirect you anywhere because like I'm not sending to my

3768
05:39:56,180 --> 05:40:01,700
camps and I don't have access to it so I can't actually redirect anywhere but thank you as always

3769
