00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,200
Johnny, why do you pronounce to sundry like that?

2
00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:02,700
Oh shit

3
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:03,800
To san-dary

4
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:04,400
To...

5
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:05,400
Loose...

6
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:06,200
Un...

7
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:07,000
Dare...

8
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:07,600
So...

9
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:08,600
Yan-dary

10
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:10,200
To san-dary

11
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:11,200
Is it not that?

12
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:12,400
It's like zun-dary

13
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:13,600
Oh no!

14
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:14,400
To is...

15
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:15,400
Is sin...

16
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:17,000
Oh, it's sundry!

17
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:17,800
Wait, no!

18
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:19,200
My alliteration!

19
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:20,900
It has to be with the T!

20
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:22,100
The T is silent!

21
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:23,800
No, my alliteration!

22
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:25,800
Why with the TV silent?

23
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:27,600
To sundry's...

24
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:29,200
Triangulate that you get tingles

25
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:31,000
Wait, you said this all your life?

26
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:31,800
Yeah, I just thought...

27
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:34,800
Why would you put a T in that if the T doesn't belong there?
