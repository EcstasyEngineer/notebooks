I feel so so inspired.
I mean, my people used to do that, that's so cool.
I mean, I've never fed on a human before,
and the smartest thing I've ever hypnotized is a seal.
But learning that my ancestors used to eat humans by the literal boatloads was amazing.
I couldn't wait to grow up and eat my fill.
Fat ones, tall ones, skinny ones, even hairy ones.
Though I learned our people aren't as feared by humans as they once were.
My ocean, my home, humans defile it with their presence, worse still, they toss their filth into it,
further insulting us. How could this have happened? How were we brought so low from our past?
They used to tell legends on every port that made even the most straight-laced superstition scoffing
marines keep on the back of their minds. They would dedicate figureheads of their ships in respect
to our beautiful yet delicate bodies. They put us on every map, but now? Ugh, disgusting humans.
One night, I envisioned a genius plan, the first strike in my crusade against the human world.
I would infiltrate in hijack a fishing vessel and use it as my own pirate vessel with a crew of
hypnotised thralls. I was going to wage a once siren war against all of humanity.
It was going to be perfect, and I definitely would have won. That was until I envisioned a plan
that was even more perfect. Er, well, at least more time efficient. Making my way below deck,
I made a strange discovery. The humans were hypnotised by their own choice. I couldn't believe it.
I looked at boat after boat. These humans charmed like a siren's spell, even dedicated their
lives to their chosen idols. These idols they fawn over were these sirens too. That's it. That's
the secret to defeating the humans. I'm going to find the secret to their magic and harness this
power myself and bring power back to my people. I must gather fame, fortune, scandals, anything
and everything to grow my influence over mankind to bring sirens back into the minds of the people.
But I'm not just going to tip the scales. I'm going for complete domination.
Every human will bend to my will. All will be cheering for their own demise. I will be the
instrument of karmic justice. The world will worship me and praise my name as I bring about their
end. I will march every human under my control into the ocean and my people will chant my name as they
have a feeding frenzy that has written into legend. Though that's a very long term goal.
With every big venture, whether business wise or lifestyle, every big undertaking starts small scale.
Right? Hmm. So, I think I'll start with you.
You wanted a feral kusugaki? I gave you a feral kusugaki.
You wanted a doten hag? I gave you a doten hag.
You wanted a dorky yandere? I gave you a dorky yandere.
You wanted a masochistic brocon? I gave you a masochistic brocon.
You wanted a milk dominatrix? I gave you a milk dominatrix.
And now, I bring you the vichu bird that no one asked for. A god damn nutty cuttlefish.
No copyright. No copyright. No copyright intended, bros. Come on, come on, come on. Relax, relax.
Did I kick or did I fucking kick, ladies and gentlemen? Have you enjoyed your evening so far?
Have you been warmed up by my girls?
Who stole your heart the most? Was it A.C., the feral polar bear, or was it Azura, the literal definition of mommy milkers?
Or what about Mercy, the yandere that can never love right? I mean, she got plenty of love to give, doesn't necessarily mean you're gonna be alive at the end of it, okay?
But hey ho, you know, you still get love done at the end of the day. Or was it Emmy, the most controversially created character of all time?
But hey ho, look, we're just gonna skip past that. You know, if you ignore the lore, everything else is fine. It's fine. It's fine. Stop worrying.
You guys are such a blurry war, honestly. Or was it Madame Shuby herself?
Because, you know, gonna be honest, didn't really get many requests for a hypnotic cuttlefish, that's Scottish, but hey ho, hey ho, that's how it goes, that's how it goes.
There's something made me, let me formally introduce myself. Look at these sleighs, they're so pretty, they're so pretty.
I, ladies and gentlemen, am Strony Cuttles. Please, Cuttles, the surname is because I'm a Cuttlefish.
Oh, shock of any. And Strony, because I am Strony, the daughter of the gamer Strontyum.
My dad's gamer tag is Strontyum. No, it's not actually Strontyum, before you're like, oh my god, you just dox your dad.
No, relax, it's not actually literally really, you know, Stronyum, but I'm Strony, Cuttles, I'm named after my dad.
My dad's gamer, and I wouldn't be here without him, you know, because he came from his ballsack.
Anyway, age, age, ladies and gentlemen, oh, yet again, I have failed the VTuber challenge of tell us your age.
It's not really looking good, okay, it's not looking good.
Cuttlefish normally live to a year, so time's ticking, time is ticking.
Anyway, my birthday is October 10th, which is actually National Squid and Cuttlefish Day.
They're both cephalopods, so I don't mind sharing that birthday with the Squid VTubers if there's any of these out there.
My height is 162cm, which makes me 5'3", because I forgot to update the slide like Adapte, but hey, hold, we're here now.
For my languages, turns out, if you're born in Scotland, the British government recognises Scottish slang as its own language, so in your face, I can speak two languages, so...
It's fantastic with that.
Show us your plaster.
No!
Oh God, can you see it?
Wait, you're not supposed to see that part, yeah!
Like, I had to censor myself, my design's a little saucy.
Anyway, what was I saying?
A-Smart, if you like A-Smart, me and my gen mates are all literally A-Smart out of the wazoo.
So don't be shy to like or subscribe on any of them.
I'll give you a bigger hint than that, but hey, hold.
I like seeing victory on my screen, because I could use any tiddly wink of serotonin possible.
And, you know, you get it from playing multiplayer games, and you're in the same boat as me.
And I also like plasters and band-aids.
For no nefarious reason, of course.
For my dislikes, grrr, you know, hate is a strong word for my dislikes instead, grrr.
I don't like bullies in video games.
Your teammates aren't often a magically beat MLG pro, so relax.
You don't have fun, it's a multiplayer game, it's a game.
Just enjoy yourself, okay?
I don't like serious people.
I don't like seriousness.
I think my gen mates can all pray for each boutch that I am the most un-serious and ridiculous.
I can't be serious.
It's terrible.
I'm the most unprofessional person they've probably ever worked with in their entire life.
And I don't like Mongolian throat singing.
I'm so sorry.
People seem to really like it, but I don't.
It doesn't sound nice.
So, I apologize to the one Mongolian throat singer that's watching right now.
I just can't.
Okay, I'm nice and generic.
Sorry, there's nothing interesting about my taste.
Movies, Lord of the Rings, best as we come.
Animes, nice and generic again.
Books.
I actually started reading books this year.
I know it sounds crazy at the end because people read books in general.
Me?
However, I started this year.
I really like dystopian books that talk about human nature and how humans are stinky poo poo heads.
For some reason, they just really capture me.
I like being depressed after reading a book.
For my music, Hatsune Miku and Atarashi Gako,
I want to see them live if it's possible.
Yeah, sorry, it's like choking my spit.
Oh, yeah.
Just a wee bit of a gamer.
A tiny bit of a gamer.
It doesn't mean I'm good at games.
Now, before there's that one person that's like,
eh, you've played all these games.
That means you're an MLG pro.
No, relax, relax.
I've played games full stop, okay?
These are the games that I remember playing
or just kind of like have a good,
yeah, play them type thing, okay?
So, you might have a few things in common.
I could, you know, move out of the way.
There's some Lego games, I still love my Lego games.
But yeah, these are all the games that I remember playing.
There's tons that I've obviously missed out on
that are like so tiny that it's kind of hard to mention.
But there's a big old square red for you
as we see it was about an Xbox gamer to apologize.
The old Call of Duty days.
Yeah.
For my goals,
I want to get monetized on YouTube.
So, feel free to subscribe
because we have been called like crazy
since announcing ourselves.
And we need watch hours.
So, don't be shy to rewatch anything
that is offered on the channel to you.
I want to stream so much
that you can basically read everything in my voice.
And, you know, you'll be Scots yourself
and you can apply for citizenship
and all that good stuff.
I also want to create a mega Ace more collab
with my gen mates,
which I've already got quite a few on the way.
So, don't worry, it's coming.
You just got to wait, okay?
I have a childhood dream, actually,
of a 100,000 gamer score.
And it's actually possible now with Xbox Game Pass.
I would absolutely love to explore
a heken amount of
childhood games.
And I would love to play
like your childhood games as well,
because obviously I was kind of at the mercy
of what my dad would buy me for childhood games,
so it doesn't quite count.
So, here's a little fun factoid about me.
I'm a wee bit of a workaholic.
So, I would like to say that for every 1000 subscribers
I get on my YouTube channel,
I'm going to upload a celebratory
really hard to say that if you're Scottish,
celebrate it already.
Ace more video, pair 1000 subscribers.
I've already got like tons
ready to go, so don't be shy.
You know what to do, wink, wink.
I also want to challenge myself.
I want to collab.
I want to make Ace more collab
with over 100 different beatubers.
And I'm actually so much of a workaholic.
I already have three confirmed
with beatubers outside of VLR, so...
I'm very serious about that.
If you ever have a 3DO, you're a beatuber,
I'm coming to find you in your DMs.
I would love if we could read Lord of the Rings together.
I think it would be so fun.
I'm not a very strong reader,
but I think it would be really cute to do like a little
before the end of stream.
We read one chapter or something like that.
And last, but certainly not least,
I would love to get stream sniped.
I absolutely adore it.
I love playing multiplayer games
where you can join me,
and you can have an amazing time,
and have so much fun.
It's just one of my favourite things, okay?
So please do not be shy.
Every week I plan on playing multiplayer games
where you can join me at any point.
I will try to make them free and accessible
as I can, but yes, yes, yes.
These are my goals. Thank you, thank you, thank you.
I'm dumb.
Okay, I'm really dumb.
I don't know how to come up with tags.
I'm not funny. I'm not good with puns.
So I am more than happy to take any suggestion.
We can figure it out very soon.
Don't worry, okay?
My Oshi marks are squid,
but I'm a cuttlefish,
but squids and cuttlefish are cephalopods,
so I don't mind sharing the emoji.
And then the second emoji
kind of looks like a man bowing.
Hmm? Hmm?
Maybe that is a hint to what I might
try to make content-wise.
And for fan names,
there is only going to be one option.
Come on, let's not beat around the bush.
You are my refling.
You will always be my refling.
And thank you so fucking much for waiting.
I have bloody missed you.
Special shout out to
Nari
and Squishy Girl.
You may have noticed a bit of a
trending pattern, right?
A bit of a trending pattern.
Squishy Girl,
conceptualized us all
and now I helped out
and made us come to life, which is beautiful, beautiful.
And also, as a little mini announcement,
the official VLR website
will be updated shortly.
And everyone who created the Gen 1
is going to be credited on the website.
So you will see these names very soon
on that website once the update comes out.
So thank you everyone who came together
to make this fantastic gen
of indulge.
Oh, okay, okay, okay, okay.
No, no.
Most people get to do
Oh, this is my gen mate's impression.
Okay? Gen mate's impression.
Me, oh no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
I picked
my gen mate's. Do you understand?
I picked them, okay?
They're all going to tell you why I picked them.
You ready for this?
Mercy's determination.
She was going to make it no matter what.
A little determining, like,
the definition of mercy in the dictionary
if you look it up, it just says determined, okay?
There was no way and heck she was not going to get in.
That's all I'm going to say on that one.
And then Emmy
I'm going to have to be
Emmy
say to someone
who's being rid to her
to keep themselves safe in Minecraft
and then she instantly got the part, okay?
I say, I say, oh, I say
has fantastic
experience
in history and she's such a hard worker.
She gives her best, okay?
She gives everything 100%
and it was absolutely beautiful.
And she actually, she had the most
professional application
even though English isn't her first language
and I'm like, god damn, A.C.,
you're fucking impressive.
Then Azura,
okay, I describe Azura
as my little diamond in the rough.
Now hear me out before you're like,
isn't that an insult? Relax.
I'm not told the full story yet, my goodness, you're jumping the gun.
I
was going to
cross off Azura's
stream as I was reviewing her
because she wasn't talking, she wasn't interacting
and she wasn't really doing anything
and then she said three words
in that voice.
Azura!
She instantly became Azura.
She said three words and she got the damn part
and she was like, in that voice, in that part.
I can't mimic her voice, okay?
But
I need gold.
Rosyksu!
Rosyksu.
And Sheevee. Sheevee is everything
I should have been in another life, okay?
She is going very far.
I'm very happy, absolutely.
I could not have asked for
better gen mates. I am blown away
that these girls even have
fucking applied to such a crazy idea.
And here we are,
debut and you guys have shown
nothing but love and support
and we are all so thankful.
I'm sure I speak for all of us when we were like
holy fuck, thank you.
Because we didn't expect any of this.
We're just like, yeah, we're just going to be my bird.
Ray, let me take you to
Zabbe.
Oh, I forgot
to pull you. It's for decoration, okay?
The tentacle in the back is for decoration.
I won't, no questions.
Let me do the full body.
Let's start with the full body.
May have a bandaid on for
reasons.
But as you can see, I got some
swivelly hips, thank you.
We'll start from the bottom.
You know how it is, okay?
So if you didn't know, I actually
have what's known as a French manicure
and pedicure.
So you can see my little
toenails.
This is French manicure pedicure.
And then you go up my face.
And
don't even be careful at my thighs because of the bandaid.
Is this smart? Is this white?
Okay, okay, I don't think that's white. Okay, check it out.
See look, I've got
oh, my voice is cracking.
I've got a French pedicure
manicure. See?
We're just going to skip past the bottom part, okay?
And as you can see
if you look really close to the elbows
I have pearlescent
to my outfit. My outfit isn't white
it's pearlescent.
So I shimmer as I move about.
It's fantastic. And so there's my
seashells at the top too.
If you look at real close
you have to really look for it.
But look, I'm a shiny little seashell.
What do you think?
It's good, no?
Yeah, I'm in the Yukata
because
it's a homage to Japanese culture
because without Japanese culture, let's be honest
maybe trippers would be here
so
you know, go a little bit catagona.
Okay, let me
let me get real close. Hopefully this isn't uncomfortable.
I know some people aren't like
the best with eye contact
but look, don't, it's me. It's me, okay?
I'm a brain.
Oh, the star.
I
I like
if I open my eyes
it opens
I love you so much.
Oh and I'm sad
I'm sad please.
Better not upset me, go subscribe
to my gem me. You upset
me.
I have pupil restrict like
what did you say?
I'm unamused.
You failed me.
I don't know, I can't do it.
I can't do it the way she does it.
She's just off the top of her head and I'm like
These are my heart eyes. I love them.
And like, okay
this is just my opinion but do you see how
my neck is doing that thing where
in the chin area and it disappears?
Oh, I love it so much
in beach of remodels when they do it.
Oh, I love it.
I love it.
You're good.
You're trying to make me blush,
would you?
Have you ever seen a blushing coffee before?
Oh, actually this is a very good point.
Some people don't like
backseat gaming.
I'm the opposite.
I'm very dumb.
I'm very happy for you a backseat game.
So you're probably going to see this one a lot
if you care to watch me at any point.
I got
I don't know
I swear
I'm looking at my jammies all day.
Like, come on, the designs are good.
Don't lie.
Oh, oh
I might have spoiled it there
but you know how
cuttlefish have hypnotic patterns?
May I please
do this for you? Are you ready?
I
I
Yes
We're going to be using this for a lot of ASMR.
You wouldn't fall for my hypnotic
capabilities.
But if you're really struggling
like if you're really struggling
How about this?
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah
It's over for you. Just admit it.
It's over for you.
I mean, how can you resist?
How can you resist this little Scottish accent?
Right
Right, right attend
Schedule time
So
my jammies are all doing
debut 2.0
which is fantastic
Me on the other hand
I'm exposing the damn company
I've had enough of VLR
I'm exposing every little
dirty secret they have
So if you're excited
to know the ins and outs of what it's like
to run a VTuber agency
to create one, to fund one
to know what goes on behind the scenes
that's right
and you can show up to my stream the more
So
Obviously
I'm playing the greatest game of all time
in my first week
Assassin's Creed Brotherhood
I will not be taking any statements
any questions
and any threats about claiming
that Assassin's Creed Brotherhood is not the
greatest game of all time
So sorry, not sorry, but yeah
We also have needy streamer overload
James Cameron's Avatar
which is such a niche game
2 people who are watching this right now
probably played it
The multiplayer game of the week is old school runescape
if you'd like to do some co-esting with me
I'm also doing an ASMR stream
and
a hand cam stream
where I'm trying foreign sweets
or can die
if you're American
or if you're Australian
you say lollipops
So yeah, we did a little
cheeky hand cam stream
I think there's
a few hand cam streams coming up from
my gen mates already
Someone was surprised I was doing hand cam
and I'm like
I mean
we're not like
I don't know what part kind of tips you off that
we're not like other agencies unironically
like was it the 80-20 split
maybe did that tip you off
or like the 100% marriage sales got the talent
was it that part that tips you off that
we're not quite like any other agency
but yeah
let's go to
Chewatt
that's a lot of movement
but yes, that is my first week
I'm pretty much an endurance streamer
so good luck keeping up with me
okay
Emmy Dookie
Emmy
right
thank you all so much
we are all going to collectively have a 30 minute rest
and then guess what
you get to see us all interact together
live
okay we're going to be telling some funny stories
some rather embarrassing stories
but hey ho it's good content
it's good content that's right
and I will thank you
also much for all the love that we've shown myself
or my gen mates at will
and we will see you in 30 minutes
you will automatically be redirected
into the lovely group room
and we will see you in 30 minutes okay
can you wait 30 minutes
30 more minutes
okay I'll see you then
okay thank you so much
bye
you
