00:00.000 --> 00:14.000
This is my favorite kind of ASMR, so if you can bear with me and ask your cup of tea,

00:14.000 --> 00:19.000
I have a hell of a lot of tingles to show you.

00:19.000 --> 00:26.000
I'm basically, I'm not really gonna be editin' out any like bumps and stuff so the audio's

00:26.000 --> 00:34.000
more organic cause some people really like the rambling aspect and like the more, it's

00:34.000 --> 00:41.000
not genuine but when you like hardcore edit something and make it like so professional

00:41.000 --> 00:46.000
sometimes it can lose its charm because like you can hear me bump the microphone or for

00:46.000 --> 00:52.000
example that noise you heard that was my thighs cause I'm currently like sitting on a chair

00:52.000 --> 01:02.000
my legs up like not on the floor but I have an immersive array of kind of like ASMR tingles

01:02.000 --> 01:09.000
to take you there, it's just kind of a little cutesy video I guess you can jump in the background

01:09.000 --> 01:16.000
but like you'll, you'll hear like this kind of noise in the back cause that's my table

01:16.000 --> 01:25.000
and it holds like over, I'm lookin' at it right now, it's probably got like 20 different

01:25.000 --> 01:32.000
tingly things and that's with items because with ASMR you can use your bobo bobo boys

01:32.000 --> 01:40.000
for tingles like repeat triggers or you can fall into the mic like see or I can actually

01:40.000 --> 01:47.000
tap the mic like this or you can do ear goping like I get you know there's so much you can

01:47.000 --> 01:55.000
freakin' do it it's amazing but I saw, I would literally surprise go one by one and just

01:55.000 --> 02:05.000
kind of do a little ear cleaning with a brush this is just a generic, it's actually a brush

02:05.000 --> 02:17.000
that came with Clean Your PC set and thank you to the radio microphone that I have

02:17.000 --> 02:26.000
the silicone ears, they actually sound pretty accurate to what you would hear like if you

02:26.000 --> 02:33.000
press your actual ears and in real life you can hear the do do do like da da da da

02:33.000 --> 02:45.000
hopefully I'm making sense but this is just this generic, general ear brush and you know

02:45.000 --> 02:53.000
everyone, instead of everyone chase, everyone has different tingles so I may do something

02:53.000 --> 03:01.000
that's not really for you but this is kind of a quick, fire type of ASMR session so

03:01.000 --> 03:09.000
don't you worry if you're like that sounds awful strongy, it's a lot to say awful

03:09.000 --> 03:15.000
or maybe I should do a guest tingles, okay you'll never actually guess what this is

03:16.000 --> 03:20.000
hear it, okay this is against your ear

03:24.000 --> 03:33.000
if anyone said sponge, congrats I'm coming down, yeah because I don't even know how you would guess that's a sponge

03:39.000 --> 03:42.000
honestly it just sounds like a crisp packet

03:46.000 --> 03:56.000
did you tingle, did you, did you, did you, that's right, tingle harder for me

03:59.000 --> 04:05.000
and okay, like I'm gonna be honest, you guys are probably like, you should probably use

04:05.000 --> 04:11.000
grips all the time and a bloody should because this is for hands, I get too excited

04:12.000 --> 04:17.000
and then I break the freaking sound barrier because I'm gonna have to put a filter on this audio

04:17.000 --> 04:22.000
so I'm not like going to lift what other tingles have I got

04:22.000 --> 04:34.000
okay, listen to this right, this is, this is on here, it's a cotton ball but if I shove it in your ear canal

04:34.000 --> 04:36.000
listen to this

04:41.000 --> 04:53.000
please help me you're tingling

05:02.000 --> 05:08.000
some people as fast as them are does well sometimes

05:08.000 --> 05:13.000
but I feel like I've, I've, I've attempted to make it in the past right

05:13.000 --> 05:23.000
but whenever I've done it I feel like I'm taking the best because like it's more supposed to be like nice

05:23.000 --> 05:28.000
and slow and relaxing here

05:28.000 --> 05:30.000
so if I just shove up and go

05:33.000 --> 05:37.000
how the fuck are you supposed to tingle for that, like honestly come with me

05:37.000 --> 05:48.000
anyway, do you hear this, this is a plastic, plastic, uh, a silicon ball

05:48.000 --> 05:52.000
there's tons of other silicon balls inside it

05:52.000 --> 05:56.000
and if I press it against your ear it sounds like you're under water with me

05:56.000 --> 05:59.000
yeah look, because I'm a gottlefish, uh uh uh, okay

06:07.000 --> 06:09.000
oh yeah

06:09.000 --> 06:12.000
it's like a chair, I don't know what it is

06:20.000 --> 06:23.000
you like my putting that against your ear

06:24.000 --> 06:26.000
hmm

06:34.000 --> 06:35.000
oh yeah

06:35.000 --> 06:38.000
I admit I cooked with that one

06:38.000 --> 06:40.000
I found it in the thrush shop

06:42.000 --> 06:46.000
and I think I must say it's also a smartest use

06:46.000 --> 06:53.000
it's always like I actually don't want to use that sound so when I look for one

06:53.000 --> 06:59.000
and I found out, I think this is probably like one of those 10, 10 tingles for me

06:59.000 --> 07:05.000
there's some tingles that are like, sorry I'm gonna have to stand up to grab the next item

07:05.000 --> 07:09.000
because, what the fuck was that noise?

07:10.000 --> 07:12.000
so many

07:12.000 --> 07:15.000
oh, I'll tell you all the popular ones

07:15.000 --> 07:18.000
hair brushing is always popular

07:18.000 --> 07:23.000
this is my, the pins on the brush, like peep peep peep

07:23.000 --> 07:27.000
do you remember when Emmy's code name was pins?

07:27.000 --> 07:28.000
hey hey hey

07:28.000 --> 07:31.000
you guys all guessed she was a fiddle

07:32.000 --> 07:35.000
but she's my fiddle doll

07:39.000 --> 07:40.000
wow

07:42.000 --> 07:45.000
do you remember when my code name went inks?

07:49.000 --> 07:52.000
and then I call all you comments that are like

07:52.000 --> 07:57.000
oh it's gonna be weird getting used to your name being so droney

07:57.000 --> 08:02.000
but I feel like it just made sense

08:02.000 --> 08:06.000
because obviously I got to name everyone

08:07.000 --> 08:10.000
and I quite like literal names

08:10.000 --> 08:13.000
this is just me being like babaga

08:13.000 --> 08:19.000
but if like, feature verse come out and their names are like

08:19.000 --> 08:25.000
you know, bag of gaijin at the end when their English is being feature verse

08:25.000 --> 08:28.000
and my name is gonna remember your name

08:28.000 --> 08:31.000
oh, and then this is me being really hypocritical

08:31.000 --> 08:34.000
because obviously I started naming them after French, right?

08:37.000 --> 08:40.000
just a quick front there

08:40.000 --> 08:43.000
I'm called Coles because I'm a Coles

08:43.000 --> 08:47.000
she be is literal because she's Shabari

08:47.000 --> 08:50.000
she be, and then Colvin Bump because she has a tail

08:50.000 --> 08:53.000
so she has Colin on her bum

08:56.000 --> 09:01.000
Emmy bees, oh, you know what, I've just said the most hypocritical thing

09:01.000 --> 09:04.000
because Emmy's name is Japanese and French

09:04.000 --> 09:08.000
her name means family because

09:08.000 --> 09:12.000
you know what, I'm gonna speak it back to the ASMR

09:12.000 --> 09:17.000
because this is just me being a silly dude with

09:17.000 --> 09:22.000
okay, so you can have like

09:22.000 --> 09:27.000
earphones on the microphone like

09:28.000 --> 09:34.000
but there are also

09:34.000 --> 09:39.000
tools and apparatuses to make such a noise

09:39.000 --> 09:43.000
so either this will be too fast to enjoy

09:43.000 --> 09:47.000
but you

09:47.000 --> 09:52.000
trying to make it too loud

09:53.000 --> 09:57.000
that's actually a really big behind the scenes thing

09:57.000 --> 10:02.000
that I have to like stop talking

10:02.000 --> 10:07.000
and then do the tingle and then lure over the actual video

10:07.000 --> 10:12.000
because some tingles are just far too loud

10:12.000 --> 10:15.000
to do at the same time stalking

10:15.000 --> 10:18.000
and then again it takes away from the organic appeal

10:18.000 --> 10:22.000
of the video but like it's just kind of

10:22.000 --> 10:25.000
the cookie crumbles in the nicest way

10:25.000 --> 10:28.000
I'm bumping fucking everything by the way

10:28.000 --> 10:31.000
okay

10:31.000 --> 10:34.000
so you hear me touch this

10:34.000 --> 10:37.000
sounds better all along

10:37.000 --> 10:40.000
what could it be

10:40.000 --> 10:44.000
oh, fuck that up

10:44.000 --> 10:47.000
it's like one of them frogs

10:50.000 --> 10:54.000
he's actually a bit loud

10:57.000 --> 11:01.000
look, I'm not really a big fan

11:01.000 --> 11:05.000
I can tap a slow feet with a wood

11:05.000 --> 11:09.000
and the wee wood thing actually likes that much more than

11:09.000 --> 11:12.000
what the perky was designed for

11:12.000 --> 11:15.000
the hail, you know what

11:15.000 --> 11:17.000
unironically though

11:17.000 --> 11:20.000
that's life, like you could be

11:20.000 --> 11:22.000
you're responding to do one thing

11:22.000 --> 11:25.000
but you're better at another thing, you know

11:25.000 --> 11:29.000
so don't feel the pressure to be this thing that you're not

11:29.000 --> 11:31.000
wow, we're getting philosophical

11:31.000 --> 11:35.000
and I'm smacking a wooden frog with a stick

11:35.000 --> 11:38.000
but I'm actually being for real though

11:38.000 --> 11:40.000
that's actually kind of true because I'll say this

11:40.000 --> 11:42.000
over and over again

11:42.000 --> 11:45.000
I have problems reading and writing

11:45.000 --> 11:49.000
my entire income and job is being paced around

11:49.000 --> 11:51.000
reading and writing

11:51.000 --> 11:53.000
so like, I'm not ever embarrassed about it

11:53.000 --> 11:57.000
like, if you've ever watched me in a live stream

11:57.000 --> 12:00.000
whenever I'd write something I have to read it for it to clear

12:00.000 --> 12:04.000
like, if I wanted to spell A.C.'s name

12:04.000 --> 12:09.000
her name is an I-C-E-Y

12:09.000 --> 12:12.000
her name is I-C-E-Y-A

12:12.000 --> 12:15.000
like, I would say it

12:15.000 --> 12:18.000
I'm like, I'm not even embarrassed about it

12:18.000 --> 12:20.000
who gives a rat's fucking arms

12:20.000 --> 12:23.000
oh, this is a Japanese ear cleaning tool

12:23.000 --> 12:28.000
I love, love, I love this trigger so much

12:28.000 --> 12:32.000
don't worry, I'm gonna subtitle this video

12:32.000 --> 12:36.000
I love this trigger so freaking much

12:36.000 --> 12:39.000
it's so good and fluffy

12:39.000 --> 12:41.000
and like, you can hear

12:41.000 --> 12:44.000
as well, actually, while I've got you here

12:44.000 --> 12:48.000
I'm gonna show you the difference between an ear cleaner

12:48.000 --> 12:51.000
and a Japanese tool, if I'm not mistaken

12:51.000 --> 12:54.000
ear cleaner, okay, got it, got it, got it

12:54.000 --> 12:56.000
okay

13:07.000 --> 13:09.000
hold on, hold on

13:16.000 --> 13:20.000
okay, I have three different things on my hand right now

13:20.000 --> 13:23.000
this is Japanese ear cleaning tool

13:25.000 --> 13:30.000
right

13:30.000 --> 13:33.000
and then this one is

13:33.000 --> 13:35.000
I want to do your most comment

13:35.000 --> 13:38.000
this one's an ear cleaner

13:38.000 --> 13:42.000
this is a Q-tip to Americans

13:42.000 --> 13:45.000
you see how it's different

13:47.000 --> 13:51.000
and then one more ear cleaning thing

13:51.000 --> 13:54.000
this is a cotton pad

13:54.000 --> 13:58.000
which is used for makeup removal in the ear

14:03.000 --> 14:06.000
now an argument

14:06.000 --> 14:09.000
okay, I just realized

14:09.000 --> 14:12.000
I'm leaving your other ear out, forgive me

14:12.000 --> 14:14.000
I'm so focused

14:15.000 --> 14:18.000
but to hear the deepness

14:19.000 --> 14:22.000
that was the cotton pad

14:22.000 --> 14:25.000
I prefer deep ASMR sounds

14:25.000 --> 14:28.000
I find them relaxing

14:28.000 --> 14:30.000
and all that jazz

14:30.000 --> 14:33.000
but I will say the Japanese ear cleaning tool

14:33.000 --> 14:35.000
is so superior

14:35.000 --> 14:37.000
like, I can't even find any

14:37.000 --> 14:40.000
and that's like, I would give it a 10 out of 10

14:40.000 --> 14:42.000
definitely

14:44.000 --> 14:47.000
oh, there's another 10 out of 10 organ I was saying

14:47.000 --> 14:51.000
this is just like, literally a dropper bowl

14:55.000 --> 14:57.000
yeah, peach

14:57.000 --> 14:59.000
I don't have any liquid in that

15:00.000 --> 15:03.000
maybe you can help me along with like

15:03.000 --> 15:05.000
that's terrible, that's terrible

15:05.000 --> 15:08.000
this is for tingling, this is for peachy

15:08.000 --> 15:11.000
peachy 13, okay

15:11.000 --> 15:14.000
we have some people who like

15:14.000 --> 15:17.000
medical sounds, like medical role play

15:17.000 --> 15:20.000
and the level dropper bowl is like a pretty good

15:23.000 --> 15:26.000
because like, sometimes an ASMR sound

15:26.000 --> 15:30.000
doesn't even have to be something that is a tool of it

15:30.000 --> 15:32.000
where the heck is me

15:33.000 --> 15:35.000
and I've lost me glove

15:35.000 --> 15:38.000
I've got a little glove that I like to use

15:38.000 --> 15:41.000
I think it makes like a really good sound

15:41.000 --> 15:45.000
like, tell me, tell me it doesn't sound like you're in the nurse's office right now

15:45.000 --> 15:47.000
like, come on

15:48.000 --> 15:50.000
if I can get a one

15:54.000 --> 15:57.000
are you ready for your prostate in my chin?

15:59.000 --> 16:02.000
but yeah, I definitely like the latex

16:02.000 --> 16:05.000
but like, in combination with the dropper

16:06.000 --> 16:09.000
got to feel it mercy actually

16:09.000 --> 16:12.000
no fingerprints, no traces left

16:13.000 --> 16:16.000
got this, this is just me

16:18.000 --> 16:20.000
just promoting everyone

16:20.000 --> 16:23.000
then he made me, I think they blow off

16:23.000 --> 16:24.000
unless

16:26.000 --> 16:29.000
can I take your tapping on glove on?

16:36.000 --> 16:38.000
I think it does look like a nice

16:38.000 --> 16:41.000
I'm a bit, I'm a bit biased, a bit partial

16:41.000 --> 16:44.000
I wouldn't say latex gloves are a 10 out of 10 tingle

16:44.000 --> 16:47.000
but I would say they rank awfully high

16:49.000 --> 16:51.000
okay, this one

16:51.000 --> 16:53.000
I hope you didn't hear that

16:53.000 --> 16:55.000
I hope I didn't ruin it

16:56.000 --> 16:58.000
this one's a 10 out of 10

16:59.000 --> 17:01.000
how

17:04.000 --> 17:06.000
how much 10 out of 10

17:09.000 --> 17:11.000
the problem with these

17:11.000 --> 17:13.000
is you have to do it slowly

17:13.000 --> 17:15.000
but you're against gravity

17:16.000 --> 17:19.000
because like, if I just do it really quick

17:19.000 --> 17:21.000
that's not tingly, is it?

17:21.000 --> 17:23.000
get a t-fuck if it's tingly

17:29.000 --> 17:32.000
must not make such a sound right now

17:32.000 --> 17:35.000
did you hear that turtle for?

17:41.000 --> 17:44.000
but here you have to slow

17:51.000 --> 17:54.000
it's definitely a good one

17:55.000 --> 17:57.000
isn't it?

17:57.000 --> 17:59.000
one more

18:09.000 --> 18:11.000
I want to read, baby

18:13.000 --> 18:17.000
what is all this going to do, ASMR or is that a purple one?

18:18.000 --> 18:21.000
no, this is lab ASMR

18:21.000 --> 18:23.000
of course I'm purple

18:24.000 --> 18:26.000
okay, actually

18:27.000 --> 18:29.000
that was so loud

18:29.000 --> 18:32.000
don't worry, I'll edit it in post-production

18:32.000 --> 18:34.000
so it doesn't break your ears

18:34.000 --> 18:36.000
but that broke my ears

18:36.000 --> 18:39.000
because I can hear myself into the microphone

18:39.000 --> 18:42.000
I use a Tascam to capture it

18:42.000 --> 18:44.000
I'm in a recording booth

18:44.000 --> 18:46.000
but it's such a waste of fucking money

18:46.000 --> 18:49.000
but you can still hear me

18:49.000 --> 18:51.000
I've put earmuffs on you

18:55.000 --> 18:57.000
Vicky

18:57.000 --> 19:00.000
I like this sound

19:01.000 --> 19:04.000
I like this sound because it's so soft

19:11.000 --> 19:14.000
I think the deeper noises

19:14.000 --> 19:17.000
this is an example of a deeper noise tingle

19:18.000 --> 19:20.000
that definitely has my

19:20.000 --> 19:22.000
appreciation

19:24.000 --> 19:26.000
because

19:28.000 --> 19:30.000
when it's like soothing and deeper

19:30.000 --> 19:32.000
like this is my theory

19:32.000 --> 19:34.000
but you didn't have to believe me

19:34.000 --> 19:36.000
you didn't have to, it's just me

19:36.000 --> 19:38.000
because it's just me, the original

19:40.000 --> 19:42.000
but I think ASMR

19:42.000 --> 19:44.000
is also locked into

19:45.000 --> 19:47.000
you don't want a baby to come soon

19:47.000 --> 19:49.000
and you have to like

19:49.000 --> 19:52.000
get soothed by like really loud noises

19:52.000 --> 19:54.000
and all of that

19:54.000 --> 19:56.000
I think that comfort

19:56.000 --> 19:59.000
possibly is linked to the

19:59.000 --> 20:02.000
comfort that ASMR can bring

20:02.000 --> 20:04.000
not the tingles, not the tingles

20:04.000 --> 20:06.000
but the comfort

20:06.000 --> 20:08.000
which is why these deeper noises

20:08.000 --> 20:11.000
are so unbelievably soothing

20:11.000 --> 20:13.000
because that was

20:13.000 --> 20:15.000
literally the first like

20:15.000 --> 20:17.000
state of

20:17.000 --> 20:19.000
just pure bliss, you know

20:19.000 --> 20:21.000
like when you were in your most

20:21.000 --> 20:23.000
tummy

20:23.000 --> 20:25.000
you didn't have to pay taxes

20:25.000 --> 20:26.000
you didn't have to

20:26.000 --> 20:28.000
like any work

20:28.000 --> 20:30.000
or even a concert

20:30.000 --> 20:32.000
you just sat there

20:32.000 --> 20:34.000
and you were like

20:34.000 --> 20:36.000
who should give you all the nutrients

20:36.000 --> 20:37.000
and you passed like shit

20:37.000 --> 20:39.000
to the political court

20:39.000 --> 20:41.000
I mean god

20:41.000 --> 20:43.000
what could you ask for more in life

20:44.000 --> 20:47.000
but that's my Thomas theory what I know T

20:47.000 --> 20:49.000
I just don't know much about

20:49.000 --> 20:50.000
you know what

20:50.000 --> 20:52.000
just because you don't know something

20:52.000 --> 20:53.000
doesn't mean you can't

20:53.000 --> 20:55.000
you can't make a statement

20:55.000 --> 20:57.000
that's wrong and loud ok

20:57.000 --> 20:59.000
I raised my case

20:59.000 --> 21:01.000
this is where I make my stand

21:01.000 --> 21:03.000
I'm looking over the mic now

21:03.000 --> 21:05.000
to see if there's other triggers

21:05.000 --> 21:07.000
I've messed up on and there is

21:07.000 --> 21:09.000
if I can teach it

21:09.000 --> 21:11.000
don't make me

21:11.000 --> 21:13.000
just making you notice

21:13.000 --> 21:15.000
ok I know I did brush in earlier

21:15.000 --> 21:17.000
but I actually have another brush

21:17.000 --> 21:20.000
compared to this brush I used earlier

21:20.000 --> 21:22.000
like right

21:22.000 --> 21:24.000
but this is a makeup brush

21:24.000 --> 21:26.000
this one and it's so much softer

21:30.000 --> 21:32.000
so soft

21:34.000 --> 21:36.000
I do that's another point as well

21:36.000 --> 21:38.000
so you don't have to only use

21:38.000 --> 21:40.000
some more trigger

21:40.000 --> 21:42.000
doing two at the same time

21:42.000 --> 21:44.000
is like so good

21:45.000 --> 21:48.000
so that's one with a brush

21:48.000 --> 21:50.000
and the other just

21:50.000 --> 21:52.000
my hand going over the ear

21:53.000 --> 21:55.000
and I'm going

21:57.000 --> 22:00.000
I'm not that good at doing triggers

22:00.000 --> 22:02.000
I have a really spitty mouth

22:02.000 --> 22:04.000
like I'm self-failing on and off

22:08.000 --> 22:10.000
so it makes it a bit hard to do

22:10.000 --> 22:12.000
like so then vocal

22:12.000 --> 22:14.000
like talking ASMR because my mouth

22:14.000 --> 22:16.000
always clicks like

22:16.000 --> 22:18.000
with spit

22:18.000 --> 22:20.000
and I don't think it's very easy

22:20.000 --> 22:22.000
and I know I don't get me wrong

22:22.000 --> 22:24.000
there's things called D-Clicker

22:24.000 --> 22:26.000
which it first can like use to get rid of

22:27.000 --> 22:29.000
but mine is like

22:29.000 --> 22:31.000
so fake it's wrong I just rather

22:31.000 --> 22:33.000
restart my whole sentence

22:33.000 --> 22:35.000
you've never noticed there's like

22:35.000 --> 22:37.000
none in this video in particular

22:37.000 --> 22:39.000
but probably much more likely in other videos

22:39.000 --> 22:41.000
there'll be like a cut

22:41.000 --> 22:43.000
my mood just slightly shifts

22:43.000 --> 22:45.000
because I've had to resource it

22:45.000 --> 22:47.000
because my mouth won't stop

22:47.000 --> 22:49.000
going go go go go

22:49.000 --> 22:51.000
and clicking

22:51.000 --> 22:53.000
wait please give me a break

22:53.000 --> 22:55.000
I'm tired

22:55.000 --> 22:57.000
I'm tired boss

22:57.000 --> 22:59.000
okay what else

22:59.000 --> 23:01.000
I'm pretty sure I saw a few others

23:01.000 --> 23:03.000
um

23:03.000 --> 23:05.000
alright

23:05.000 --> 23:07.000
that was a good one

23:07.000 --> 23:09.000
alright

23:09.000 --> 23:11.000
one is like some professional

23:11.000 --> 23:13.000
um

23:13.000 --> 23:15.000
okay this one is

23:15.000 --> 23:17.000
a cup

23:17.000 --> 23:19.000
like it's literally just a plastic ass cup

23:19.000 --> 23:21.000
but the reason why I like it

23:21.000 --> 23:23.000
is because

23:23.000 --> 23:25.000
if I put it over your ear

23:32.000 --> 23:34.000
that sounds like fucking shit

23:34.000 --> 23:36.000
it sounds so much better in person

23:36.000 --> 23:38.000
I'm just gonna have to come here

23:38.000 --> 23:40.000
to show you how much that was awful

23:41.000 --> 23:43.000
okay this is an old

23:43.000 --> 23:45.000
plastic phone case

23:45.000 --> 23:47.000
so

23:47.000 --> 23:49.000
you know you can do fingerprint

23:49.000 --> 23:51.000
it's more like this is just my finger

23:51.000 --> 23:53.000
being pressed against it

23:55.000 --> 23:56.000
like in like the

23:56.000 --> 23:58.000
the center of my skin

23:58.000 --> 24:00.000
um or

24:00.000 --> 24:02.000
obviously you can do your little nails

24:02.000 --> 24:04.000
against it

24:04.000 --> 24:06.000
and uh

24:06.000 --> 24:08.000
just

24:08.000 --> 24:10.000
whatever your amounts is

24:12.000 --> 24:14.000
I hope this has been enough for

24:14.000 --> 24:16.000
I feel like I've just yapped a bit

24:16.000 --> 24:18.000
I'm so unmasked in our time

24:18.000 --> 24:20.000
I'm just

24:20.000 --> 24:22.000
I'm just gonna have to lure and edit the volume

24:22.000 --> 24:24.000
under the case that I've made an ASMR audio

24:24.000 --> 24:26.000
and the reality is

24:26.000 --> 24:28.000
it's just another yap this from

24:28.000 --> 24:30.000
here's truly

24:32.000 --> 24:34.000
honestly I prefer to act quite

24:34.000 --> 24:36.000
like this one

24:36.000 --> 24:38.000
when I say it's a 10 out of 10

24:38.000 --> 24:40.000
I think you know what

24:40.000 --> 24:42.000
I've had fake nails on and like

24:42.000 --> 24:44.000
the would hit a bit better

24:44.000 --> 24:46.000
cause

24:46.000 --> 24:48.000
cause fake nails like give that availability

24:48.000 --> 24:50.000
of just sounding

24:50.000 --> 24:52.000
better in more

24:52.000 --> 24:54.000
but

24:54.000 --> 24:56.000
I also have this

24:56.000 --> 24:58.000
fluffy thing that I can put on

24:58.000 --> 25:00.000
against the

25:00.000 --> 25:02.000
ear

25:02.000 --> 25:04.000
ear

25:04.000 --> 25:06.000
but yes I'll talk to you on that

25:06.000 --> 25:08.000
so you'll be able to sound like

25:08.000 --> 25:10.000
often on my ear

25:12.000 --> 25:14.000
and thank you

25:18.000 --> 25:20.000
all of you baby

25:26.000 --> 25:28.000
I'll listen to some people like

25:28.000 --> 25:30.000
when they can hear my breathing

25:30.000 --> 25:32.000
so

25:32.000 --> 25:34.000
I don't

25:34.000 --> 25:36.000
fuck

25:40.000 --> 25:42.000
I guess breathing can be so

25:42.000 --> 25:44.000
like I used

25:44.000 --> 25:46.000
to get my eyelashes done

25:48.000 --> 25:50.000
and the lady obviously had to be in

25:50.000 --> 25:52.000
close proximity

25:52.000 --> 25:54.000
and she would just be turning and I'd

25:54.000 --> 25:56.000
like

25:56.000 --> 25:58.000
because she was just like near me breathing

25:58.000 --> 26:00.000
and I'm like I'm at a weird door

26:00.000 --> 26:02.000
for getting tingles from breathing ASMR

26:02.000 --> 26:04.000
but

26:04.000 --> 26:06.000
it is what it is

26:06.000 --> 26:08.000
you don't pick the tingles

26:08.000 --> 26:10.000
the tingles pick you

26:10.000 --> 26:12.000
what else am I going to

26:12.000 --> 26:14.000
I'm sure of course I don't know

26:14.000 --> 26:16.000
sorry I was scratching my thigh there

26:18.000 --> 26:20.000
I have some like

26:20.000 --> 26:22.000
it's not really

26:22.000 --> 26:24.000
not tingling this is a

26:24.000 --> 26:26.000
plastic pouch

26:26.000 --> 26:28.000
it has a little click

26:28.000 --> 26:30.000
oh that size is breaking

26:32.000 --> 26:34.000
my sound barrier

26:34.000 --> 26:36.000
oh dear

26:36.000 --> 26:38.000
that one didn't

26:40.000 --> 26:42.000
if you didn't know the task gun

26:42.000 --> 26:44.000
will flash red

26:44.000 --> 26:46.000
like

26:46.000 --> 26:48.000
if I'm being too loud

26:48.000 --> 26:50.000
it's like oh my god your tingles

26:50.000 --> 26:52.000
are out of control lady

26:52.000 --> 26:54.000
and so I know

26:54.000 --> 26:56.000
when I'm being a bit too loud

26:56.000 --> 26:58.000
but I can't see the task gun

26:58.000 --> 27:00.000
in like every recording session

27:00.000 --> 27:02.000
it's just not possible because of my setup

27:02.000 --> 27:04.000
although I don't know if I should record

27:04.000 --> 27:06.000
on my pc

27:06.000 --> 27:08.000
but

27:08.000 --> 27:10.000
yeah I'm toying

27:14.000 --> 27:16.000
maybe you like plastic

27:16.000 --> 27:18.000
fingerprints

27:20.000 --> 27:22.000
actually sounds pretty sticky

27:22.000 --> 27:24.000
actually kind of like that

27:24.000 --> 27:26.000
yeah you like my sticky

27:26.000 --> 27:28.000
fingers being on you

27:40.000 --> 27:42.000
now there is

27:42.000 --> 27:44.000
an ASMR

27:44.000 --> 27:46.000
this noise

27:46.000 --> 27:48.000
is really hard to capture

27:50.000 --> 27:52.000
I have

27:52.000 --> 27:54.000
two

27:54.000 --> 27:56.000
wooden ear picks

27:56.000 --> 27:58.000
but wooden ear picking ASMR

27:58.000 --> 28:00.000
is really fake and hard to capture

28:00.000 --> 28:02.000
it's just because

28:02.000 --> 28:04.000
it sounds like I'm

28:04.000 --> 28:06.000
fingering your ear or something

28:10.000 --> 28:12.000
this one actually do have to like

28:12.000 --> 28:14.000
focus a little bit on your ear

28:16.000 --> 28:18.000
but either this is

28:18.000 --> 28:20.000
good or just kind of sounds like

28:20.000 --> 28:22.000
I'm brushing some around on my ear

28:22.000 --> 28:24.000
but

28:24.000 --> 28:26.000
I promise

28:26.000 --> 28:28.000
I have two wooden ear picks

28:32.000 --> 28:34.000
oh I can maybe

28:34.000 --> 28:36.000
add tweezers

28:36.000 --> 28:38.000
hold on

28:38.000 --> 28:40.000
some people like tweezers

28:40.000 --> 28:42.000
sounds but

28:42.000 --> 28:44.000
that's the only sound they make

28:44.000 --> 28:46.000
they don't like make a natural sound

28:46.000 --> 28:48.000
I think

28:48.000 --> 28:50.000
for visual ASMR

28:50.000 --> 28:52.000
I would make some visual ASMR

28:52.000 --> 28:54.000
and I can show you many

28:54.000 --> 28:56.000
else

28:56.000 --> 28:58.000
cause I like

28:58.000 --> 29:00.000
my nails so

29:00.000 --> 29:02.000
yeah for you

29:08.000 --> 29:10.000
well yes

29:10.000 --> 29:12.000
mister

29:12.000 --> 29:14.000
your ears are delightfully clean

29:14.000 --> 29:16.000
but there's nothing

29:16.000 --> 29:18.000
that

29:18.000 --> 29:20.000
is bad what

29:20.000 --> 29:22.000
sounds I'm going with here

29:22.000 --> 29:24.000
try to see your ears are clean

29:24.000 --> 29:26.000
but I'll just clean them further

29:26.000 --> 29:28.000
which makes no sense

29:28.000 --> 29:30.000
but that's okay

29:30.000 --> 29:32.000
I'm allowed to be dumb

29:32.000 --> 29:34.000
and I

29:34.000 --> 29:36.000
forgive myself

29:36.000 --> 29:38.000
yeah

29:38.000 --> 29:40.000
you like the way those ear picks and tweezers

29:40.000 --> 29:42.000
feel that's right

29:42.000 --> 29:44.000
no

29:46.000 --> 29:48.000
I mean

29:48.000 --> 29:50.000
I would say I did a decent

29:50.000 --> 29:52.000
thing over here

29:52.000 --> 29:54.000
how long have we been recording for

29:54.000 --> 29:56.000
I have no idea

29:56.000 --> 29:58.000
how long have I been there in minutes

30:00.000 --> 30:02.000
I've been yapping for 30 minutes

30:02.000 --> 30:04.000
why have you left me yapping for so long

30:04.000 --> 30:06.000
what the hell

30:06.000 --> 30:08.000
how has it been 30 minutes

30:08.000 --> 30:10.000
oh my god I've got problems

30:10.000 --> 30:12.000
seriously

30:12.000 --> 30:14.000
I mean maybe it's less

30:14.000 --> 30:16.000
but because I had to edit some stuff

30:16.000 --> 30:18.000
I hope

30:18.000 --> 30:20.000
I'm leaving my tummy noises in

30:20.000 --> 30:22.000
so

30:22.000 --> 30:24.000
hopefully

30:24.000 --> 30:26.000
you're asleep by now

30:26.000 --> 30:28.000
and if you're not then

30:28.000 --> 30:30.000
I'll be hearing so many awful eyes away

30:30.000 --> 30:32.000
and

30:32.000 --> 30:34.000
I'll just put it away

30:34.000 --> 30:36.000
for a little bit

30:36.000 --> 30:38.000
I don't know

30:38.000 --> 30:40.000
okay

30:40.000 --> 30:42.000
wait I'm sure I had a few more tangles

30:42.000 --> 30:44.000
wait don't go yet don't leave

30:44.000 --> 30:46.000
I want to show you more

30:46.000 --> 30:48.000
okay

30:48.000 --> 30:50.000
I see

30:50.000 --> 30:52.000
I said I see

30:52.000 --> 30:54.000
no I say

30:54.000 --> 30:56.000
I said I say snow pose

30:56.000 --> 30:58.000
I said I see visually

30:58.000 --> 31:00.000
okay I'll call it three more triggers

31:00.000 --> 31:02.000
and then I'll let you go

31:02.000 --> 31:04.000
okay I'll let you go

31:04.000 --> 31:06.000
you do it in the ear

31:06.000 --> 31:08.000
okay

31:08.000 --> 31:10.000
okay you heard me move one of them

31:10.000 --> 31:12.000
but don't

31:12.000 --> 31:14.000
this one

31:14.000 --> 31:16.000
it's like a little

31:16.000 --> 31:18.000
water thing

31:18.000 --> 31:20.000
and I can just

31:20.000 --> 31:22.000
that went on my face

31:22.000 --> 31:24.000
I didn't realize it was pointed on me

31:24.000 --> 31:26.000
so

31:26.000 --> 31:28.000
I can't do it against the ears a little bit

31:28.000 --> 31:30.000
but you know

31:30.000 --> 31:32.000
no one wants to put water in your very

31:32.000 --> 31:34.000
expensive equipment

31:34.000 --> 31:36.000
this equipment was expensive

31:36.000 --> 31:38.000
was it worth it? I don't know yet

31:40.000 --> 31:42.000
but yeah

31:42.000 --> 31:44.000
oh yeah

31:44.000 --> 31:46.000
oh I can do it

31:46.000 --> 31:48.000
oh

31:48.000 --> 31:50.000
yeah

31:50.000 --> 31:52.000
oh you feel so refreshed

31:52.000 --> 31:54.000
listen up to this ASMR

31:54.000 --> 31:56.000
okay the other one

31:56.000 --> 31:58.000
this one's quite loud so I might not talk

31:58.000 --> 32:00.000
too much during it because I'll need to lower

32:00.000 --> 32:02.000
the volume

32:02.000 --> 32:04.000
but I got

32:04.000 --> 32:06.000
pop rocks I'm not going to do it

32:06.000 --> 32:08.000
but like I'm going to shake the packet

32:08.000 --> 32:10.000
of the pop rocks

32:32.000 --> 32:34.000
I'm not being funny I was so

32:34.000 --> 32:36.000
unbelievably loud

32:36.000 --> 32:38.000
okay last angle

32:38.000 --> 32:40.000
and this one's a 10 out of 10 for me

32:40.000 --> 32:42.000
okay

32:42.000 --> 32:44.000
you can totally hear it actually

32:44.000 --> 32:46.000
oh oh oh

32:46.000 --> 32:48.000
are you ready?

32:48.000 --> 32:50.000
see

33:02.000 --> 33:04.000
so

33:32.000 --> 33:34.000
so

33:52.000 --> 33:54.000
why did you think

33:54.000 --> 33:56.000
I was double

33:56.000 --> 33:58.000
ASMR and it's like

33:58.000 --> 34:00.000
what's one of my top 10's as well

34:00.000 --> 34:08.000
But if you're not asleep by now, I'm not sure what I can do.

34:08.000 --> 34:15.000
Um, I could keep down that tingle until you are asleep.

34:15.000 --> 34:17.000
Would that be fine?

34:17.000 --> 34:19.000
Like, I wouldn't talk anymore.

34:19.000 --> 34:22.000
Cause I feel like if I keep talking, this was keeping you awake.

34:22.000 --> 34:25.000
Cause you're like, what's the next tingle, strongy?

34:25.000 --> 34:30.000
Um, right, I'll make you a deal.

34:30.000 --> 34:35.000
You close your eyes, you're nice and comfy.

34:35.000 --> 34:43.000
I will keep tickling you to prove that tickling ASMR is like one of the superior triggers.

34:43.000 --> 34:46.000
Because like, breathing is good and all like,

34:47.000 --> 34:56.000
or, but I think tickling in this case, okay, I just need to prove it's superior.

34:56.000 --> 34:59.000
So, I'll let you go now.

34:59.000 --> 35:04.000
But thank you for listening to me rubble for 30 minutes.

35:04.000 --> 35:08.000
Cause I eat always 30, 5 minutes.

35:08.000 --> 35:13.000
Okay, jish, jish, my shish.

35:13.000 --> 35:15.000
Okay, I'll let you go.

35:15.000 --> 35:17.000
And I'm going to tickling ASMR.

35:17.000 --> 35:19.000
And I'll see you on the other side, okay?

35:19.000 --> 35:21.000
Bye.

35:21.000 --> 35:22.000
Can I do it?

35:22.000 --> 35:24.000
I'm going to let you do ASMR ear kiss.

35:24.000 --> 35:26.000
Just one, just one kiss, okay?

35:26.000 --> 35:29.000
But what ear should I do it on?

35:29.000 --> 35:30.000
This one.

35:30.000 --> 35:31.000
And this one.

35:31.000 --> 35:34.000
I feel biased to this ear.

35:34.000 --> 35:36.000
Good night.

35:43.000 --> 35:45.000
Good night.

36:13.000 --> 36:16.000
Good night.

36:43.000 --> 36:46.000
Good night.

37:13.000 --> 37:15.000
Good night.
